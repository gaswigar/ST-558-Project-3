the
tree
of
heaven
by
may
sinclair
author
of
three
etc
part
i
peace
i
frances
harrison
was
sitting
out
in
the
garden
under
the
tree
that
her
husband
called
an
and
that
the
people
down
in
her
part
of
the
country
called
a
tree
of
heaven
it
was
warm
under
the
tree
and
frances
might
have
gone
to
sleep
there
and
wasted
an
hour
out
of
the
afternoon
if
it
had
been
for
the
children
dorothy
michael
and
nicholas
were
going
to
a
party
and
nicky
was
excited
she
could
hear
old
nanna
talking
to
michael
and
telling
him
to
be
a
good
boy
she
could
hear
young
singing
to
baby
john
baby
john
was
too
young
himself
to
go
to
parties
so
to
make
up
for
that
he
was
riding
furiously
on
knee
to
the
tune
of
the
major
it
was
nicky
first
party
that
was
why
he
was
excited
he
had
asked
her
for
the
third
time
what
it
would
be
like
and
for
the
third
time
she
had
told
him
there
would
be
dancing
and
a
magic
lantern
and
a
funny
man
and
a
big
white
cake
covered
with
sugar
icing
and
rosalind
name
on
it
in
pink
sugar
letters
and
eight
little
pink
wax
candles
burning
on
the
top
for
rosalind
birthday
nicky
eyes
shone
as
she
told
him
dorothy
who
was
nine
years
old
laughed
at
nicky
look
at
nicky
she
said
how
excited
he
is
and
every
time
she
laughed
at
him
his
mother
kissed
him
i
do
care
said
nicky
i
do
care
if
i
am
becited
and
for
the
fifth
time
he
asked
when
will
it
be
time
to
go
not
for
another
hour
and
a
half
my
sweetheart
how
long
said
nicky
is
an
hour
and
a
half
frances
had
a
tranquil
nature
and
she
never
worried
but
as
she
sat
under
her
tree
of
heaven
a
thought
came
that
made
a
faint
illusion
of
worry
for
her
mind
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmeline
and
auntie
edie
to
tea
she
had
come
to
think
of
them
like
that
in
relation
to
her
children
rather
than
to
her
or
to
each
other
it
was
a
tuesday
and
they
had
not
been
there
since
friday
perhaps
she
thought
i
better
send
over
for
them
now
especially
as
it
such
a
beautiful
afternoon
supposing
i
sent
michael
and
yet
supposing
anthony
came
home
early
he
was
always
kind
to
her
people
but
that
was
the
very
reason
why
she
ought
to
let
them
spoil
a
beautiful
afternoon
for
him
it
could
not
be
said
that
any
of
them
was
amusing
she
could
still
hear
singing
her
song
about
the
major
she
could
still
hear
old
nanna
talking
to
michael
and
telling
him
to
be
a
good
boy
that
could
only
end
in
michael
being
naughty
to
avert
naughtiness
or
any
other
disaster
from
her
children
was
the
end
of
frances
existence
so
she
called
michael
to
come
to
her
he
came
running
like
a
little
dog
obediently
michael
was
glad
that
he
had
been
sent
across
the
heath
to
house
with
a
message
it
made
him
feel
big
and
brave
besides
it
would
put
off
the
moment
when
would
come
for
him
to
make
him
ready
for
the
party
he
was
not
sure
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
it
michael
did
not
much
like
going
to
grannie
house
either
in
all
the
rooms
there
was
a
queer
and
creepiness
it
smelt
of
and
elder
bushes
and
of
grandpapa
funeral
and
when
you
had
seen
auntie
edie
senegal
and
the
stuffed
fish
and
the
inside
of
auntie
louie
there
was
nothing
else
to
see
his
mother
said
that
grandpapa
funeral
was
all
over
and
that
the
green
creepiness
came
from
the
green
creepers
but
michael
knew
it
did
she
only
said
things
like
that
to
make
you
feel
nice
and
comfy
when
you
were
going
to
bed
michael
knew
very
well
that
they
had
put
grandpapa
into
the
and
locked
the
door
so
that
the
funeral
men
should
get
at
him
and
take
him
away
too
soon
and
auntie
louie
had
kept
the
key
in
her
pocket
funerals
meant
taking
people
away
old
nanna
would
let
him
talk
about
it
but
had
told
him
that
was
what
funerals
meant
all
the
same
as
he
went
up
the
flagged
path
he
took
care
not
to
look
through
the
black
panes
of
the
window
where
the
elder
bush
was
lest
he
should
see
grandpapa
coffin
standing
in
the
place
where
the
big
table
used
to
be
and
grandpapa
lying
inside
it
wrapped
in
a
white
sheet
michael
message
was
that
mummy
sent
her
love
and
would
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmeline
and
auntie
edie
come
to
tea
she
was
going
to
have
tea
in
the
garden
and
would
they
please
come
early
as
early
as
possible
that
was
the
part
he
was
not
to
forget
the
queer
thing
was
that
when
michael
went
to
see
grannie
and
the
aunties
in
grannie
house
he
saw
four
old
women
they
wore
black
dresses
that
smelt
sometimes
of
something
sweet
and
sometimes
like
your
fingers
when
you
get
ink
on
them
the
aunties
looked
cross
and
auntie
emmeline
smelt
as
if
she
had
been
crying
he
thought
that
perhaps
they
had
not
been
able
to
stop
crying
since
grandpapa
funeral
he
thought
that
was
why
auntie
louie
nose
was
red
and
shiny
and
auntie
eyelids
had
pink
edges
instead
of
lashes
in
grannie
house
they
never
let
you
do
anything
they
never
did
anything
themselves
they
never
wanted
to
do
anything
not
even
to
talk
he
thought
it
was
because
they
knew
that
grandpapa
was
still
there
all
the
time
but
outside
it
the
aunties
were
not
so
very
old
they
rode
bicycles
and
when
they
came
to
michael
father
house
they
forgot
all
about
grandpapa
funeral
and
ran
about
and
played
tennis
like
mother
and
jervis
and
they
talked
a
lot
michael
mother
was
grannie
child
to
see
how
she
could
be
a
child
you
had
only
to
think
of
her
in
her
nightgown
with
her
long
brown
hair
plaited
in
a
pigtail
hanging
down
her
back
and
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
but
he
could
see
how
the
three
aunties
could
be
grannie
other
children
they
were
bigger
than
grannie
and
they
had
grey
hair
grannie
was
a
little
thing
she
was
white
and
dry
and
she
had
hair
like
hay
besides
she
hardly
ever
took
any
notice
of
them
except
to
make
a
face
at
auntie
emmeline
or
auntie
edie
now
and
then
she
did
it
with
her
head
a
little
on
one
side
pushing
out
her
underlip
and
drawing
it
back
again
grannie
interested
michael
but
more
when
he
thought
about
her
than
when
she
was
actually
there
she
stood
for
him
as
the
mark
and
measure
of
past
time
to
understand
how
old
grannie
was
you
had
to
think
backwards
this
way
once
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
no
michael
but
there
was
mummy
and
there
was
daddy
and
once
there
was
a
time
when
there
was
no
mummy
and
no
daddy
but
there
was
grannie
and
there
was
grandpapa
now
there
was
no
grandpapa
but
he
could
think
back
far
enough
to
get
to
the
time
when
there
was
no
grannie
michael
thought
that
being
grannie
must
feel
like
being
god
before
he
came
to
the
black
window
pane
and
the
elder
bush
he
had
to
run
down
the
slopes
and
jump
the
gullies
on
his
side
of
the
heath
and
cross
the
west
road
and
climb
the
other
slope
to
grannie
side
and
it
was
not
till
you
got
to
the
row
of
elms
on
judge
walk
that
you
had
to
go
carefully
because
of
the
funeral
he
stood
there
on
the
ridge
of
the
walk
and
looked
back
to
his
own
side
there
were
other
houses
there
but
he
knew
his
father
house
by
the
tree
of
heaven
in
the
garden
the
garden
stood
on
a
high
flat
promontory
jutting
out
into
the
heath
a
brown
brick
wall
with
buttresses
strong
like
fortifications
on
a
breastwork
enclosed
it
on
three
sides
from
the
flagged
terrace
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
you
looked
down
through
the
tops
of
the
that
rose
against
the
rampart
over
the
wild
places
of
the
heath
there
was
another
flagged
terrace
at
the
other
end
of
the
garden
the
house
rose
sheer
from
its
pavement
brown
brick
like
the
wall
and
with
the
white
wings
of
its
storm
shutters
spread
open
row
on
row
it
barred
the
promontory
from
the
mainland
and
at
the
back
of
it
beyond
its
kitchen
garden
and
its
courtyard
a
fringe
of
heath
still
parted
it
from
the
hill
road
that
went
from
jack
straw
castle
to
the
bull
and
bush
you
reached
it
by
a
lane
that
led
from
the
road
to
the
heath
the
house
belonged
to
the
heath
and
the
open
country
it
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
heath
and
the
open
country
between
it
and
harrow
on
the
hill
it
had
the
air
of
all
the
old
houses
of
hampstead
the
wonderful
air
of
not
acknowledging
the
existence
of
bank
holidays
it
was
lifted
up
high
above
the
town
shut
in
utterly
secluded
anthony
harrison
considered
that
he
had
done
well
when
he
acquired
west
end
house
for
his
wife
frances
and
for
his
children
dorothea
michael
nicholas
and
john
frances
had
said
that
if
he
was
thinking
of
her
he
need
buy
a
big
place
because
she
did
want
one
but
he
might
buy
it
for
the
children
if
he
liked
anthony
had
said
that
she
had
no
idea
of
what
she
want
once
she
began
to
give
her
mind
to
it
and
that
he
would
like
to
think
of
her
living
in
it
after
he
was
gone
not
that
he
had
any
intention
of
going
he
was
only
not
much
older
than
frances
and
incurably
healthy
but
since
his
wife
attention
had
become
absorbed
in
the
children
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
interest
he
was
always
trying
to
harrow
her
by
the
suggestion
and
frances
only
laughed
at
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
a
silly
old
thing
and
that
he
need
think
he
was
going
to
get
round
her
that
way
there
was
no
other
way
open
for
anthony
unless
he
were
to
go
bankrupt
or
get
pneumonia
or
peritonitis
frances
would
have
been
the
first
to
acknowledge
that
illness
or
misfortune
constituted
a
claim
and
the
only
things
he
ever
did
get
were
loud
explosive
colds
in
his
head
which
made
him
a
mark
for
derision
his
business
was
so
sound
that
not
even
a
revolution
or
a
european
war
could
shake
it
and
his
appearance
was
incompatible
with
his
pretensions
to
pathos
it
would
have
paid
him
better
to
have
been
small
and
weedy
or
lamentably
fat
or
to
have
had
a
bald
place
coming
or
crow
feet
pointing
to
grey
hairs
for
then
there
might
have
been
a
chance
for
him
but
anthony
body
was
well
made
slender
and
tall
he
had
blue
eyes
and
hair
and
the
look
of
an
amiable
hawk
alert
fiercely
benevolent
frances
could
see
any
pathos
in
the
kind
of
figure
she
happened
to
admire
most
the
only
kind
she
would
have
tolerated
in
a
husband
and
if
she
seen
any
pathos
in
it
she
would
have
married
it
pathos
she
said
was
all
very
well
in
a
father
or
a
brother
or
a
friend
but
in
choosing
a
husband
you
had
to
think
of
your
children
and
she
had
wanted
boys
that
would
look
like
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
do
you
mean
anthony
had
said
boys
that
will
look
like
me
i
mean
she
had
answered
exactly
what
i
say
you
need
be
so
arrogant
arrogance
had
been
beyond
all
bearing
since
john
the
third
son
had
been
born
and
it
was
frances
after
all
who
had
made
him
buy
west
end
house
for
her
own
reasons
both
the
day
nursery
and
the
night
nursery
had
windows
to
the
south
it
was
the
kind
of
house
she
had
always
dreamed
of
living
in
and
of
michael
or
nicky
living
in
after
she
and
anthony
were
gone
it
was
not
more
than
seven
minutes
walk
from
the
bottom
of
the
lane
to
the
house
where
her
people
lived
she
had
to
think
about
the
old
people
when
the
poor
dears
had
come
up
to
london
in
order
to
be
thought
about
and
it
had
white
storm
shutters
and
a
tree
of
heaven
in
the
garden
and
because
they
had
both
decided
that
they
would
have
that
house
whatever
happened
they
began
to
argue
and
to
tease
each
other
anthony
had
said
it
was
all
right
only
the
tree
of
heaven
was
a
tree
of
heaven
it
was
a
common
ash
he
was
one
of
the
biggest
timber
merchants
in
the
country
and
he
ought
to
know
frances
said
she
might
know
much
but
she
did
know
that
was
the
kind
of
tree
the
people
down
in
her
part
of
the
country
called
a
tree
of
heaven
anthony
said
he
help
that
it
did
matter
what
they
called
it
it
was
a
common
ash
then
she
told
him
he
had
no
poetry
in
his
composition
she
had
always
dreamed
of
having
a
tree
of
heaven
in
her
garden
and
he
was
destroying
her
dream
he
replied
that
he
did
want
to
destroy
her
dream
but
the
tree
really
an
ash
you
could
tell
by
the
bark
and
by
the
leaves
and
by
the
number
and
the
shape
of
the
leaflets
and
anyhow
that
was
the
first
he
heard
about
her
dream
you
do
know
said
frances
what
goes
on
inside
me
she
said
that
if
any
of
the
children
developed
an
imagination
he
think
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
sha
said
anthony
i
would
have
anything
to
do
with
it
if
i
could
facts
are
good
enough
for
me
the
children
must
be
brought
up
to
realize
facts
an
was
a
fact
and
a
tree
of
heaven
was
a
fancy
unless
by
any
chance
she
meant
he
knew
she
did
if
she
wanted
to
know
the
buds
of
the
ash
were
black
like
ebony
the
buds
of
the
tree
of
heaven
were
like
like
bad
mahogany
wait
till
the
spring
and
look
at
the
buds
frances
waited
till
the
spring
and
looked
at
the
buds
and
sure
enough
they
were
black
like
ebony
anthony
also
said
that
if
they
were
choosing
a
house
for
the
children
it
was
no
earthly
use
to
think
about
the
old
people
for
the
old
people
would
go
and
the
children
would
remain
as
if
to
show
how
right
he
was
grandpapa
had
died
early
in
that
summer
of
one
month
after
they
had
moved
into
west
end
house
that
still
left
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmeline
and
auntie
edie
for
anthony
to
look
after
she
was
thinking
of
them
now
she
hoped
that
they
would
come
early
in
time
to
see
the
children
she
also
hoped
that
they
would
go
early
so
that
she
and
anthony
might
have
their
three
sets
of
tennis
before
dinner
in
peace
there
would
be
no
peace
if
louie
and
edie
wanted
to
play
too
the
one
thing
that
anthony
could
not
stand
was
people
wanting
to
do
things
they
could
do
and
spoiling
them
for
those
who
could
he
used
to
say
that
the
sight
of
louie
anywhere
near
the
tennis
court
put
him
off
his
stroke
again
the
faint
illusion
of
worry
was
created
by
the
thought
that
this
dreadful
thing
might
happen
that
louie
and
edie
might
want
to
play
and
that
anthony
would
be
put
off
his
stroke
and
be
annoyed
and
that
his
annoyance
his
just
and
legitimate
annoyance
would
spoil
the
perfection
of
the
afternoon
and
as
she
played
with
the
illusion
it
made
more
real
her
tranquillity
her
incredible
content
her
hands
were
busy
now
putting
decorative
stitches
into
a
frock
for
john
she
had
pushed
aside
a
novel
by
george
moore
and
a
volume
of
ibsen
plays
she
disliked
ibsen
and
disapproved
of
george
moore
her
firm
tight
little
character
defended
itself
against
every
form
of
intellectual
disturbance
a
copy
of
the
had
fallen
from
her
lap
to
her
feet
jane
the
cat
had
found
it
there
and
purring
loudly
had
trodden
it
down
into
a
bed
and
now
lay
on
it
asleep
frances
had
informed
herself
of
the
affairs
of
the
nation
at
the
bottom
of
her
mind
was
the
conviction
profound
because
unconscious
that
the
affairs
of
the
nation
were
not
to
be
compared
for
interest
with
her
own
affairs
and
an
attitude
of
condescension
as
if
she
honoured
the
by
reading
it
and
the
nation
by
informing
herself
of
its
affairs
also
the
very
distinct
impression
that
evening
papers
were
more
attractive
than
morning
papers
she
would
have
admitted
that
they
owed
their
attraction
to
the
circumstance
that
anthony
brought
them
home
with
him
in
his
pocket
and
that
in
the
evening
she
was
not
obliged
to
inform
herself
of
what
might
be
happening
anthony
was
certain
to
inform
her
not
that
anything
ever
did
happen
except
strikes
and
even
then
no
sooner
did
the
features
of
the
strike
begin
to
get
dramatic
than
they
were
instantly
submerged
in
the
flood
of
conversation
that
was
let
loose
over
them
anthony
pitied
the
poor
editors
and
reporters
while
parliament
was
sitting
she
saw
them
as
rather
silly
violent
and
desperate
men
yet
pathetic
in
their
silliness
violence
and
desperation
snatching
at
divorces
and
breach
of
promise
cases
and
fires
in
paraffin
shops
as
drowning
men
snatch
at
straws
her
imagination
refused
to
picture
any
end
to
this
state
of
things
there
would
just
be
more
speeches
and
more
strikes
and
still
more
speeches
going
on
for
ever
and
ever
at
home
while
foreign
affairs
and
the
british
empire
went
on
for
ever
and
ever
too
with
no
connection
between
the
two
lines
of
sequence
and
no
likeness
except
that
both
somehow
went
on
and
on
that
was
anthony
view
of
england
parliament
and
of
her
imperial
policy
and
it
was
anthony
politics
anthony
said
had
become
static
and
he
assured
frances
that
there
was
no
likelihood
that
they
would
ever
become
dynamic
again
ever
anthony
view
of
politics
was
anthony
view
of
life
nothing
ever
really
happened
things
did
not
change
they
endured
they
went
on
at
least
everything
that
really
mattered
endured
and
went
on
so
that
everything
that
really
mattered
could
if
you
were
given
to
looking
forward
be
foreseen
a
strike
a
really
bad
one
might
conceivably
affect
anthony
business
for
a
time
but
not
all
the
strikes
in
the
world
not
all
the
silly
speeches
not
all
the
meddling
and
muddling
of
politicians
could
ever
touch
one
of
those
enduring
things
frances
believed
in
permanence
because
in
secret
she
abhorred
the
thought
of
change
and
she
abhorred
the
thought
of
change
because
at
she
had
got
all
the
things
she
wanted
but
only
for
the
last
ten
years
out
of
the
before
that
before
she
was
anthony
wanting
things
letting
it
be
known
that
you
wanted
them
had
meant
not
getting
them
so
that
it
was
incredible
how
she
had
contrived
to
get
them
all
she
had
not
yet
left
off
being
surprised
at
her
own
happiness
it
was
not
like
things
you
take
for
granted
and
are
not
aware
of
frances
was
profoundly
aware
of
it
her
happiness
was
a
solid
tangible
thing
she
knew
where
it
resided
and
what
it
was
made
of
and
what
terms
she
held
it
on
it
depended
on
her
on
her
truth
her
love
her
loyalty
it
was
of
the
nature
of
a
trust
but
there
was
no
illusion
about
it
it
was
the
reality
she
denied
that
she
was
arrogant
for
she
had
not
taken
one
of
them
for
granted
not
even
dorothy
though
a
little
arrogance
might
have
been
excusable
in
a
woman
who
had
borne
three
sons
and
only
one
daughter
before
she
was
whereas
grannie
achievement
had
been
four
daughters
four
superfluous
women
of
whom
anthony
had
married
one
and
supported
three
to
be
sure
there
was
maurice
but
he
was
worse
than
superfluous
considering
that
most
of
the
time
anthony
was
supporting
maurice
too
she
had
only
known
one
serious
anxiety
lest
her
flesh
and
blood
should
harbour
any
of
the
blood
and
flesh
left
over
after
morrie
was
made
she
had
married
anthony
to
drive
out
morrie
from
the
bodies
and
souls
of
her
children
she
meant
that
through
her
and
anthony
morrie
should
go
and
dorothea
michael
nicholas
and
john
should
remain
as
frances
looked
at
the
four
children
her
mouth
tightened
itself
so
as
to
undo
the
ruinous
adoration
of
her
eyes
she
loved
their
slender
bodies
their
pure
candid
faces
their
thick
straight
hair
that
parted
solidly
from
the
brush
and
shining
like
sheets
of
polished
metal
brown
for
dorothy
for
nicholas
red
gold
for
michael
and
white
gold
for
john
she
was
glad
that
they
were
all
made
like
that
slender
and
clear
and
hard
and
that
their
very
hair
was
a
thing
of
clean
surfaces
and
definite
edges
she
disliked
the
blurred
outlines
of
fatness
and
fuzziness
and
fluffiness
the
bright
solidity
of
their
forms
helped
her
to
her
adored
illusion
the
illusion
of
their
childhood
as
going
on
lasting
for
ever
and
ever
they
would
be
the
nicest
looking
children
at
jervis
party
they
would
stand
out
solid
from
the
fluffiness
and
fuzziness
and
fatness
of
the
others
she
saw
people
looking
at
them
she
heard
them
saying
who
are
the
two
little
boys
in
brown
linen
they
are
michael
and
nicholas
harrison
the
funny
man
came
and
said
hello
i
did
expect
to
see
you
here
it
was
michael
and
nicholas
he
did
expect
to
see
and
the
noise
in
the
room
was
nicky
darling
laughter
music
played
michael
and
nicholas
danced
to
the
music
it
was
body
and
nicky
that
kept
for
her
the
pattern
of
the
dance
their
feet
that
beat
out
its
measure
sitting
under
the
tree
of
heaven
frances
could
see
jervis
party
it
shimmered
and
clustered
in
a
visionary
space
between
the
tree
and
the
border
of
blue
larkspurs
on
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
the
firm
figures
of
michael
and
nicholas
and
dorothy
held
it
together
kept
it
from
being
shattered
amongst
the
steep
blue
spires
of
the
larkspurs
when
it
was
all
over
they
would
still
hold
it
together
so
that
people
would
know
that
it
had
really
happened
and
remember
having
been
there
they
might
even
remember
that
rosalind
had
had
a
birthday
frances
had
just
bestowed
this
life
after
death
on
jervis
party
when
she
heard
michael
saying
he
did
want
to
go
to
it
he
had
no
idea
why
he
did
want
to
go
except
that
he
did
what
said
frances
not
when
nicky
and
dorothy
are
going
he
shook
his
head
he
was
mournful
and
serious
and
there
going
to
be
a
magic
lantern
i
know
and
a
funny
man
i
know
and
a
big
white
cake
with
sugar
icing
and
rosalind
name
on
it
in
pink
letters
and
eight
candles
i
know
mummy
michael
under
lip
began
to
shake
i
thought
it
was
only
little
baby
boys
that
were
silly
and
shy
michael
was
not
prepared
to
contest
the
statement
he
saw
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
in
the
circumstances
she
was
bound
to
say
all
the
same
his
under
lip
would
have
gone
on
shaking
if
he
had
stopped
it
i
thought
you
were
a
big
boy
said
frances
so
i
yesterday
is
yesterday
mummy
if
john
john
was
asked
to
a
beautiful
party
would
be
afraid
to
go
as
soon
as
michael
under
lip
had
stopped
shaking
his
eyelids
began
you
could
stop
your
eyelids
it
not
exactly
he
said
what
is
it
then
it
sort
sort
of
forgetting
things
what
things
i
do
know
mummy
i
think
it
pieces
of
me
that
i
want
to
remember
at
a
party
i
ca
feel
all
of
myself
at
once
like
i
do
now
she
loved
his
strange
thoughts
as
she
loved
his
strange
beauty
his
reddish
yellow
hair
his
light
hazel
eyes
that
were
not
hers
and
not
anthony
what
will
you
do
sweetheart
all
afternoon
without
nicky
and
dorothy
and
i
do
want
nicky
and
dorothy
and
i
want
myself
i
want
to
play
with
myself
she
thought
why
should
he
what
right
have
i
to
say
these
things
to
him
and
make
him
cry
and
send
him
to
stupid
parties
that
he
want
to
go
to
after
all
he
only
a
little
boy
she
thought
of
michael
who
was
seven
as
if
he
were
younger
than
nicholas
who
was
only
five
nicky
was
different
you
could
never
tell
what
michael
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
think
you
could
never
tell
what
nicky
would
take
it
into
his
head
to
do
there
was
no
guile
in
michael
but
sometimes
there
was
guile
in
nicky
frances
was
always
on
the
look
out
for
nicky
guile
so
when
michael
remarked
that
grannie
and
the
aunties
would
be
there
immediately
and
nicky
said
mummy
i
think
my
ear
is
going
to
ache
her
answer
was
you
wo
have
to
stay
more
than
a
minute
darling
for
nicky
lived
in
perpetual
fear
that
his
auntie
louie
might
kiss
at
him
dorothy
saw
her
mother
profound
misapprehension
and
she
hastened
to
put
it
right
it
is
auntie
louie
mummy
his
ear
is
really
aching
and
still
frances
went
on
smiling
she
knew
and
nicky
knew
that
if
a
little
boy
could
establish
the
fact
of
earache
he
was
absolved
from
all
social
and
family
obligations
for
as
long
as
his
affliction
lasted
he
would
have
to
stand
still
and
pretend
he
liked
it
while
he
was
being
kissed
at
frances
kept
her
mouth
shut
when
she
smiled
as
if
she
were
trying
not
to
it
was
her
upper
lip
that
got
the
better
of
her
the
fine
thin
edges
of
it
quivered
and
twitched
and
curled
you
would
have
said
the
very
down
was
sensitive
to
her
thought
secret
and
iniquitous
play
her
smile
mocked
other
people
solemnities
her
husband
solemnity
and
the
solemnity
no
doubt
inherited
of
her
son
michael
it
mocked
the
demureness
and
the
gravity
of
her
face
she
had
brought
her
face
close
to
nicky
and
it
was
as
if
her
mouth
had
eyes
in
it
to
see
if
there
were
guile
in
him
are
you
a
little
humbug
she
said
nicky
loved
his
mother
face
it
never
got
excited
or
did
silly
things
like
other
people
faces
it
never
got
red
and
shiny
like
auntie
louie
face
or
hot
and
rough
like
auntie
emmeline
or
wet
and
mizzly
like
auntie
edie
the
softness
and
whiteness
and
dryness
of
his
mother
face
were
delightful
to
nicky
so
was
her
hair
it
was
cold
with
a
funny
sort
of
coldness
that
made
your
fingers
tingle
when
you
touched
it
and
it
smelt
like
the
taste
of
brazil
nuts
frances
saw
the
likeness
of
her
smile
quiver
on
nicky
upper
lip
it
broke
and
became
nicky
smile
that
bared
his
little
teeth
and
curled
up
the
corners
of
his
blue
eyes
his
blue
eyes
and
black
brown
hair
were
anthony
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
that
nicky
had
earache
when
he
could
smile
like
that
i
afraid
she
said
you
a
little
humbug
run
to
the
terrace
and
see
if
grannie
and
the
aunties
are
coming
he
ran
it
was
half
a
child
run
and
half
a
boy
then
anthony
addressed
her
daughter
why
did
you
say
his
ear
aching
when
it
is
because
said
dorothy
it
aching
she
was
polite
and
exquisite
and
obstinate
like
anthony
nicky
ought
to
know
his
own
ear
best
go
and
tell
him
he
not
to
stand
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
if
they
coming
wave
to
them
to
show
you
glad
to
see
them
but
mummy
i
not
she
knew
it
was
dreadful
before
she
said
it
but
she
had
warded
off
reproof
by
nuzzling
against
her
mother
cheek
as
it
tried
to
turn
away
from
her
she
saw
her
mother
upper
lip
moving
twitching
the
sensitive
down
stirred
on
it
like
a
dark
smudge
a
dust
that
quivered
her
own
mouth
pushed
forward
searching
the
mouth
of
a
nuzzling
puppy
remained
grave
and
tender
she
was
earnest
and
imperturbable
in
her
truthfulness
whether
you
glad
or
not
you
must
go
said
frances
she
meant
to
be
obeyed
dorothy
went
her
body
was
obedient
for
as
yet
she
had
her
body
and
her
face
her
blunted
oval
the
straight
nose
with
the
fine
tilted
nostrils
her
brown
eyes
her
solid
hair
brown
on
the
top
and
light
underneath
and
on
the
curve
of
the
roll
above
her
little
ears
frances
had
watched
the
appearance
of
those
details
with
an
anxiety
that
would
have
surprised
her
if
she
had
been
aware
of
it
she
wanted
to
see
herself
in
the
bodies
of
her
sons
and
in
the
mind
of
her
daughter
but
dorothy
had
her
father
mind
you
could
move
it
what
she
had
said
once
she
stuck
to
for
ever
like
anthony
to
his
as
if
sticking
to
a
thing
for
ever
could
make
it
right
once
and
dorothy
had
formed
the
habit
of
actually
being
right
like
anthony
nine
times
out
of
ten
frances
foresaw
that
this
persistence
this
unreasoning
rectitude
might
in
time
become
annoying
in
a
daughter
there
were
moments
when
she
was
almost
perturbed
by
the
presence
of
this
small
mysterious
organism
mixed
up
of
her
body
and
her
husband
mind
but
in
secret
she
admired
her
daughter
candour
her
downrightness
and
straightforwardness
her
disdain
of
conventions
and
hypocrisies
frances
was
not
glad
she
knew
she
was
not
glad
any
more
than
dorothy
was
glad
to
see
her
mother
and
her
sisters
she
only
pretended
in
secret
she
was
afraid
of
every
moment
she
would
have
to
live
with
them
she
had
lived
with
them
too
long
she
foresaw
what
would
happen
this
afternoon
how
they
would
look
what
they
would
say
and
do
and
with
what
gestures
it
would
be
like
the
telling
for
the
thirteenth
time
of
a
dull
story
that
you
know
every
word
of
she
thought
she
had
sent
them
a
kind
message
but
she
knew
she
had
only
asked
them
to
come
early
in
order
that
they
might
go
early
and
leave
her
to
her
happiness
she
went
down
to
the
terrace
wall
where
michael
and
nicky
and
dorothy
were
watching
for
them
she
was
impatient
and
she
thought
that
she
wanted
to
see
them
coming
but
she
only
wanted
to
see
if
they
were
coming
early
it
struck
her
that
this
was
sad
small
and
distant
the
four
black
figures
moved
on
the
slope
under
the
judges
walk
four
spots
of
black
that
crawled
on
the
sallow
grass
and
the
yellow
clay
of
the
heath
how
little
they
look
michael
said
their
littleness
and
their
distance
made
them
harmless
made
them
pathetic
frances
was
sorry
that
she
was
not
glad
that
was
the
difference
between
her
and
dorothy
that
she
was
sorry
and
always
would
be
sorry
for
not
being
what
she
ought
to
be
and
dorothy
never
would
be
sorry
for
being
what
she
was
she
seemed
to
be
saying
already
in
her
clearness
and
hardness
what
i
am
i
am
and
you
ca
change
me
the
utmost
you
could
wring
from
her
was
that
she
could
help
it
frances
sorrow
was
almost
unbearable
when
the
four
women
in
black
came
nearer
when
she
saw
them
climbing
the
slope
below
the
garden
and
the
lane
ii
grannie
took
a
long
time
crossing
the
lawn
from
the
door
in
the
lane
to
the
tree
of
heaven
she
came
first
her
daughters
followed
forced
to
her
slow
pace
advancing
with
an
air
of
imperfect
cohesion
of
not
really
belonging
to
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
strangers
associated
by
some
accident
it
had
grown
on
them
in
their
efforts
to
carry
off
the
embarrassment
of
appearing
as
an
eternal
trio
auntie
louie
carried
it
off
best
sharp
and
rigid
auntie
louie
figure
never
lent
itself
to
any
group
but
for
her
black
gown
she
really
might
not
have
belonged
fleming
went
slowly
not
because
she
was
old
for
she
was
only
sixty
but
because
though
she
said
and
thought
that
she
was
wrapped
up
in
frances
and
her
children
she
was
still
absorbed
fascinated
by
her
sacred
sense
of
bereavement
she
moved
as
if
hypnotized
by
her
own
sorrow
to
her
three
unmarried
daughters
she
behaved
with
a
sort
of
mystic
hostility
a
holy
detachment
and
displeasure
as
if
she
suspected
them
of
getting
over
it
or
of
wanting
to
get
over
it
if
they
could
but
to
her
one
married
daughter
and
to
her
she
was
soft
and
gentle
so
that
when
they
happened
to
be
all
together
her
moods
changed
so
rapidly
that
she
seemed
a
creature
of
unaccountable
caprice
one
minute
her
small
white
dry
face
quivered
with
softness
and
gentleness
and
the
next
it
stiffened
or
twitched
with
the
inimical
disapproving
look
it
had
for
louie
and
emmeline
and
edith
the
children
lifted
up
their
pure
impassive
faces
to
be
kissed
at
old
nanna
brought
baby
john
and
put
him
on
his
grandmother
knee
dorothy
and
nicholas
went
off
with
to
the
party
michael
forgot
all
about
playing
with
himself
he
stayed
where
he
was
drawn
by
the
spectacle
of
grannie
and
the
aunties
grannie
was
clucking
and
chuckling
to
baby
john
as
she
had
clucked
and
chuckled
to
her
own
babies
long
ago
her
under
lip
made
itself
wide
and
full
it
worked
with
an
in
and
out
movement
very
funny
and
interesting
to
michael
the
movement
meant
that
grannie
chuckled
under
protest
of
memories
that
were
sacred
to
grandpapa
tchoo
tchoo
tchoo
tchoo
chuckaboo
beautiful
boy
said
grannie
auntie
louie
looked
at
her
youngest
nephew
she
smiled
her
downward
sagging
smile
wrung
from
a
virginity
sadder
than
grannie
grief
she
spoke
to
baby
john
you
really
are
rather
a
nice
boy
auntie
louie
said
but
edie
the
youngest
auntie
was
kneeling
on
the
grass
before
him
bringing
her
face
close
to
his
baby
john
new
and
flawless
face
was
cruel
to
auntie
edie
so
was
his
look
of
dignity
and
wisdom
oh
she
says
you
only
rather
nice
said
auntie
edie
and
the
beautifullest
sweetest
darlingest
that
ever
was
was
she
a
nasty
auntie
louie
ten
little
pink
toes
and
he
goes
five
little
tootsies
to
each
of
his
footsies
she
hid
herself
behind
the
disturbing
jane
where
she
cried
where
he
gone
to
can
anybody
tell
me
where
to
find
where
there
he
is
look
at
auntie
edie
oh
he
wo
pay
any
attention
to
poor
me
baby
john
was
playing
earnestly
with
grannie
you
might
leave
the
child
alone
said
grannie
ca
you
see
he
does
want
you
auntie
edie
made
a
little
pouting
face
like
a
scolded
pathetic
child
nobody
ever
did
want
auntie
edie
and
all
the
time
auntie
emmy
was
talking
to
frances
very
loud
and
fast
frances
i
do
think
your
garden
too
beautiful
for
words
how
clever
of
you
to
think
of
clearing
away
the
old
i
hate
on
a
lawn
yet
i
do
suppose
i
should
have
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
get
rid
of
them
if
it
bad
been
me
as
she
talked
auntie
emmy
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
her
eyebrows
jerked
the
left
one
leaping
up
above
the
right
she
thrust
out
her
chin
at
you
and
her
long
inquiring
nose
her
thin
face
was
the
play
of
agitated
that
pulled
it
thus
into
perpetual
restless
movements
and
she
made
vague
gestures
with
her
large
bony
hands
her
tongue
went
like
a
clock
anthony
said
hear
tongue
striking
the
roof
of
all
thee
time
and
putting
those
delphiniums
all
together
like
that
massing
the
blues
anthony
i
think
anthony
has
perfect
taste
i
adore
delphiniums
auntie
emmy
was
behaving
as
if
neither
michael
nor
baby
john
was
there
do
you
think
too
beautiful
for
words
said
frances
do
you
like
him
a
little
bit
too
auntie
emmy
winced
as
if
frances
had
flicked
something
in
her
face
of
course
i
like
him
too
why
should
i
i
do
think
you
auntie
emmy
michael
said
auntie
emmy
considered
him
as
for
the
first
time
what
do
you
know
about
it
she
said
i
can
tell
by
the
funny
things
your
face
does
i
thought
said
frances
you
wanted
to
play
by
yourself
so
i
do
said
michael
well
then
go
and
play
he
went
and
to
a
heavenly
place
that
he
knew
of
but
as
he
played
with
himself
there
he
thought
auntie
emmy
does
tell
the
truth
i
think
it
is
because
she
is
happy
michael
kept
his
best
things
to
himself
i
suppose
you
happy
said
grannie
now
you
got
the
poor
child
sent
away
auntie
emmy
raised
her
eyebrows
and
spread
out
her
hands
as
much
as
to
say
she
was
helpless
under
her
mother
stupidity
he
have
been
sent
away
anyhow
said
frances
it
is
good
for
him
to
hang
about
listening
to
conversation
it
was
her
part
to
keep
the
peace
between
her
mother
and
her
sisters
it
seems
to
me
said
auntie
louie
that
you
began
it
yourself
when
a
situation
became
uncomfortable
auntie
louie
always
put
her
word
in
and
made
it
worse
she
never
would
let
frances
keep
the
peace
frances
knew
what
louie
meant
that
she
was
always
flinging
her
babies
in
emmy
face
at
those
moments
when
the
sight
of
other
people
babies
was
too
much
for
emmy
she
could
never
be
prepared
for
emmy
moments
it
all
very
well
auntie
louie
went
on
but
i
should
like
to
hear
of
somebody
admiring
dorothy
i
do
see
where
dorothy
comes
in
dorothy
was
supposed
by
the
two
nannas
to
be
auntie
louie
favourite
if
you
taxed
her
with
it
she
was
indignant
and
declared
that
she
was
sure
she
was
and
again
frances
knew
what
louie
meant
that
she
loved
her
three
sons
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
with
passion
and
her
one
daughter
dorothea
with
critical
affection
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
louie
was
always
saying
and
thinking
about
people
and
nobody
ever
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
what
louie
said
or
thought
frances
told
herself
that
if
there
was
one
emotion
that
she
was
more
free
from
than
another
it
was
sex
jealousy
the
proof
of
it
which
she
offered
now
was
that
she
had
given
up
dorothy
to
anthony
it
was
natural
that
he
should
care
most
for
the
little
girl
louie
said
that
was
easy
when
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
anthony
did
like
frances
he
cared
most
for
his
three
sons
she
was
leaving
dorothy
to
anthony
so
that
anthony
might
leave
michael
and
nicholas
to
her
you
might
just
as
well
say
frances
said
that
i
in
love
with
poor
little
i
might
said
louie
just
as
well
grannie
said
she
was
sure
she
did
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
and
that
louie
had
some
very
queer
ideas
in
her
head
louie
she
said
knows
more
than
i
do
frances
thought
was
grannie
really
stupid
was
she
really
innocent
was
she
not
rather
clever
of
the
secret
wisdom
and
the
secret
cruelty
of
sex
frances
was
afraid
of
her
thoughts
they
came
to
her
not
like
thoughts
but
like
quick
rushes
of
her
blood
partly
confusing
her
she
did
not
like
that
she
thought
supposing
grannie
knew
all
the
time
that
emmy
was
unhappy
and
took
a
perverse
pleasure
in
her
knowledge
supposing
she
was
not
really
soft
and
gentle
she
could
be
soft
and
gentle
to
her
because
of
her
children
and
because
of
anthony
she
respected
anthony
because
he
was
and
efficient
and
successful
and
had
supported
her
ever
since
grandpapa
had
gone
bankrupt
she
was
proud
of
frances
because
she
was
anthony
wife
who
had
had
three
sons
and
only
one
daughter
grannie
behaved
as
if
her
grandchildren
were
her
own
children
as
if
she
had
borne
three
sons
and
only
one
daughter
instead
of
four
daughters
and
only
one
son
still
frances
was
the
vehicle
of
flesh
and
blood
that
carried
on
her
flesh
and
blood
in
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
she
respected
frances
but
frances
could
remember
a
time
when
she
had
been
unmarried
like
her
sisters
and
when
grannie
had
turned
on
her
too
that
look
that
was
half
contempt
and
half
hostility
or
displeasure
grannie
had
not
wanted
her
to
marry
anthony
any
more
than
she
would
have
wanted
louie
or
emmeline
or
edith
to
marry
anybody
supposing
anybody
had
wanted
to
marry
them
and
frances
and
anthony
had
defied
her
they
had
insisted
on
marrying
each
other
frances
knew
that
if
there
had
been
no
anthony
her
mother
would
have
despised
her
in
secret
as
in
secret
she
despised
emmeline
and
edith
she
despised
them
more
than
louie
because
poor
things
they
wanted
palpably
to
be
married
whereas
louie
did
or
said
she
did
in
her
own
way
louie
had
defied
her
mother
she
had
bought
a
and
a
bicycle
with
her
own
earnings
and
by
partially
supporting
herself
she
had
defied
anthony
the
male
benefactor
louie
manner
intimated
that
there
was
nothing
frances
had
that
she
wanted
she
had
resources
in
herself
and
frances
had
none
frances
persuaded
herself
that
she
admired
and
respected
louie
she
knew
that
she
frances
was
only
admired
and
respected
because
she
had
succeeded
where
her
three
sisters
had
failed
she
was
even
afraid
that
in
moments
of
exasperation
grannie
used
her
and
anthony
and
the
children
to
punish
emmy
and
edie
for
their
failure
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
stand
between
them
and
grannie
it
was
possible
that
if
grannie
had
been
allowed
to
ignore
them
and
give
her
whole
attention
to
frances
or
michael
or
baby
john
she
could
have
contrived
to
be
soft
and
gentle
for
an
afternoon
but
neither
louie
nor
emmeline
nor
even
edith
would
consent
to
be
ignored
they
refused
to
knuckle
under
to
give
in
theirs
was
a
perpetual
struggle
to
achieve
an
individuality
in
the
teeth
of
circumstances
that
had
denied
them
any
frances
acknowledged
that
they
were
right
that
in
the
same
circumstances
she
would
have
done
the
same
in
their
different
ways
and
by
different
methods
they
claimed
attention
they
claimed
it
incessantly
louie
the
eldest
by
an
attitude
of
assurance
and
superiority
so
stiff
and
hard
that
it
seemed
invulnerable
emmy
by
sudden
jerky
enthusiasms
exaltations
intensities
edie
by
an
exaggerated
animation
a
false
excitement
edie
would
drop
from
a
childish
merriment
to
a
childish
pathos
when
she
would
call
herself
poor
me
and
demand
pity
for
being
tired
for
missing
a
train
for
cold
feet
for
hair
coming
down
there
would
be
still
more
animation
and
still
more
enthusiasm
when
anthony
came
home
frances
prided
herself
on
her
power
of
foreseeing
things
she
foresaw
that
anthony
would
come
home
early
for
his
game
she
foresaw
the
funny
nervous
agony
of
his
face
when
he
appeared
on
the
terrace
and
caught
sight
of
grannie
and
the
three
aunties
and
the
elaborate
and
exquisite
politeness
with
which
he
would
conceal
from
them
his
emotion
she
foresaw
that
she
would
say
to
annie
when
the
master
comes
tell
him
we
having
tea
in
the
garden
under
the
tree
of
under
the
for
after
all
he
was
the
master
and
discipline
must
be
maintained
she
foresaw
the
very
gestures
of
his
entrance
the
ironically
solemn
bow
that
he
would
make
to
her
from
the
terrace
she
even
foresaw
the
kind
of
joke
that
for
the
life
of
him
he
would
not
be
able
to
help
making
she
was
so
made
that
she
could
live
happily
in
this
world
of
small
foreseen
things
iii
and
it
all
happened
as
she
had
foreseen
anthony
came
home
early
because
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
he
made
the
kind
of
joke
that
calamity
always
forced
from
him
by
some
perversion
of
his
instincts
when
is
an
not
an
when
it
a
tree
of
heaven
he
was
exquisitely
polite
to
grannie
and
the
aunties
and
his
manner
to
frances
which
she
openly
complained
of
was
he
said
what
a
woman
brought
on
herself
when
she
reserved
her
passion
for
her
children
her
sentiment
for
trees
of
heaven
and
her
mockery
for
her
devoted
husband
i
suppose
we
can
have
some
tennis
said
auntie
louie
certainly
said
anthony
we
can
and
we
shall
he
tried
not
to
look
at
frances
and
auntie
edie
became
automatically
animated
i
ca
serve
for
nuts
but
i
can
run
who
going
to
play
with
i
am
said
anthony
he
was
perfect
the
game
of
tennis
had
an
unholy
and
terrible
attraction
for
auntie
louie
and
auntie
edie
neither
of
them
could
play
but
whereas
auntie
louie
thought
that
she
could
play
and
took
tennis
seriously
auntie
edie
knew
that
she
could
and
took
it
as
a
joke
auntie
louie
stood
tall
and
rigid
and
immovable
she
planted
herself
like
a
man
close
up
to
the
net
where
anthony
wanted
to
be
and
where
he
should
have
been
but
auntie
louie
said
she
was
no
good
if
you
put
her
to
play
back
she
could
be
expected
to
take
every
ball
he
missed
when
auntie
louie
called
out
play
she
meant
to
send
a
nervous
shudder
through
her
opponents
shattering
their
morale
she
went
through
all
the
gestures
of
an
annihilating
service
that
for
some
reason
never
happened
she
said
the
net
was
too
low
and
that
spoiled
her
eye
and
when
she
missed
her
return
it
was
because
anthony
had
looked
at
her
and
put
her
off
still
aunt
louie
attitude
had
this
advantage
that
it
kept
her
quiet
in
one
place
where
anthony
could
dance
round
and
round
her
but
auntie
edie
played
in
little
nervous
runs
and
slides
and
rushes
she
flung
herself
with
screams
of
excitement
against
the
ball
her
partner
and
the
net
and
she
brandished
her
racket
in
a
dangerous
manner
the
oftener
she
missed
the
funnier
it
was
to
auntie
edie
she
had
been
pretty
when
she
was
young
and
seventeen
years
ago
her
cries
and
tumbles
and
collisions
had
been
judged
amusing
and
auntie
edie
thought
they
were
amusing
still
anthony
had
never
had
the
heart
to
undeceive
her
so
that
when
anthony
was
there
auntie
edie
still
went
about
setting
a
standard
of
gaiety
for
other
people
to
live
up
to
and
still
she
was
astonished
that
they
never
did
that
other
people
had
no
sense
of
humour
therefore
frances
was
glad
when
anthony
told
her
that
he
had
asked
parsons
the
children
tutor
and
young
norris
and
young
vereker
from
the
office
to
come
round
for
tennis
at
six
and
that
dinner
must
be
put
off
till
eight
all
was
well
the
evening
would
be
sacred
to
anthony
and
the
young
men
the
illusion
of
worry
passed
and
frances
real
world
of
happiness
stood
firm
and
as
frances
mind
being
a
thoroughly
healthy
mind
refused
to
entertain
any
dreary
possibility
for
long
together
so
it
was
simply
unable
to
foresee
downright
calamity
even
when
it
had
been
pointed
out
to
her
for
instance
that
nicky
should
really
have
chosen
the
day
of
the
party
for
an
earache
the
worst
earache
he
had
ever
had
he
appeared
at
carried
in
arms
and
with
his
head
tied
up
in
one
of
jervis
cricket
scarves
as
he
approached
his
family
he
tried
hard
not
to
look
pathetic
and
at
the
sight
of
her
little
son
her
whole
brilliant
world
of
happiness
was
shattered
around
frances
nicky
darling
she
said
why
you
tell
me
it
was
really
aching
i
did
know
said
nicky
he
never
did
know
the
precise
degree
of
pain
that
distinguished
the
beginning
of
a
genuine
earache
from
that
of
a
sham
one
and
he
felt
that
to
palm
off
a
sham
earache
on
his
mother
for
a
real
one
was
somehow
a
sneaky
thing
to
do
and
while
his
ear
went
on
stabbing
him
nicky
did
his
best
to
explain
you
see
i
never
know
whether
it
aching
or
whether
it
only
going
to
ache
it
began
a
little
teeny
bit
when
the
funny
man
made
me
laugh
and
i
did
see
the
magic
lantern
and
i
did
have
any
of
cake
it
came
on
when
i
was
biting
the
sugar
off
and
it
was
aching
in
both
ears
at
once
it
was
said
nicky
a
jolly
sell
for
me
at
that
moment
nicky
earache
jabbed
upwards
at
his
eyelids
and
cut
them
and
shook
tears
out
of
them
but
nicky
mouth
refused
to
take
any
part
in
the
performance
though
he
let
his
father
carry
him
upstairs
and
as
he
lay
on
the
big
bed
in
his
mother
room
he
said
he
thought
he
could
bear
it
if
he
had
to
lie
beside
him
and
his
anthony
went
back
into
the
garden
to
fetch
jane
he
spent
an
hour
looking
for
her
wandering
in
utter
misery
through
the
house
and
through
the
courtyard
and
stables
and
the
kitchen
garden
he
looked
for
jane
in
the
hothouse
and
the
cucumber
frames
and
under
the
rhubarb
and
on
the
scullery
roof
and
in
the
water
butt
it
was
just
possible
that
on
a
day
of
complete
calamity
jane
should
have
slithered
off
the
scullery
roof
into
the
the
least
he
could
do
was
to
find
jane
since
nicky
wanted
her
and
in
the
end
it
turned
out
that
jane
had
been
captured
in
her
sleep
treacherously
by
auntie
emmy
and
she
had
escaped
maddened
with
terror
of
the
large
nervous
incessantly
caressing
hands
she
had
climbed
into
the
highest
branch
of
the
tree
of
heaven
and
crouched
there
glaring
unhappy
damn
the
cat
said
anthony
to
himself
it
was
not
jane
he
meant
he
was
distressed
irritated
absurdly
upset
because
he
would
have
to
go
back
to
nicky
without
jane
because
he
could
get
nicky
what
he
wanted
in
that
moment
anthony
loved
nicky
more
than
any
of
them
he
loved
him
almost
more
than
frances
nicky
earache
ruined
the
fine
day
he
confided
in
young
vereker
i
would
bother
he
said
if
the
little
chap
was
so
plucky
about
it
quite
so
sir
said
young
vereker
it
was
young
vereker
who
found
jane
who
eventually
recaptured
her
young
vereker
made
himself
glorious
by
climbing
up
at
the
risk
of
his
neck
and
in
his
new
white
flannels
into
the
high
branches
of
the
tree
of
heaven
to
bring
jane
down
and
when
anthony
thanked
him
he
said
do
mention
it
sir
it
only
a
trifle
though
it
was
as
norris
said
palpable
that
the
flannels
were
ruined
still
if
he
had
found
that
confounded
cat
they
would
never
humanly
speaking
have
had
their
tennis
the
aunties
did
not
see
vereker
climbing
into
the
tree
of
heaven
they
did
not
see
him
playing
with
parsons
and
anthony
and
norris
for
as
soon
as
the
three
young
men
appeared
and
emmeline
and
edith
began
to
be
interested
and
emphatic
grannie
said
that
as
they
would
see
anything
more
of
frances
and
the
children
it
was
no
good
staying
any
longer
and
they
better
be
getting
back
it
was
as
if
she
knew
that
they
were
going
to
enjoy
themselves
and
was
determined
to
prevent
it
frances
went
with
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
lane
she
stood
there
till
the
black
figures
had
passed
one
by
one
through
the
white
posts
on
to
the
heath
till
in
the
distance
they
became
small
again
and
harmless
and
pathetic
then
she
went
back
to
her
room
where
nicky
lay
in
the
big
bed
nicky
lay
in
the
big
bed
with
jane
on
one
side
of
him
and
his
on
the
other
and
a
bag
of
hot
salt
against
each
ear
now
and
then
a
thin
wall
of
sleep
slid
between
him
and
his
earache
frances
sat
by
the
open
window
and
looked
out
into
the
garden
where
anthony
and
norris
played
quietly
yet
fiercely
against
vereker
and
parsons
frances
loved
the
smell
of
fresh
grass
that
the
balls
and
the
men
feet
struck
from
the
lawn
she
loved
the
men
voices
subdued
to
nicky
sleep
and
the
sound
of
their
padding
feet
the
thud
of
the
balls
on
the
turf
the
smacking
and
thwacking
of
the
rackets
she
loved
every
movement
of
anthony
handsome
energetic
body
she
loved
the
quick
supple
bodies
of
the
young
men
the
tense
poise
and
earnest
activity
of
their
adolescence
but
it
was
not
vereker
or
parsons
or
norris
that
she
loved
or
that
she
saw
it
was
michael
nicholas
and
john
whose
adolescence
was
foreshadowed
in
those
athletic
forms
wearing
white
flannels
michael
nicky
and
john
in
white
flannels
playing
fiercely
when
young
vereker
drew
himself
to
his
full
height
when
his
young
body
showed
lean
and
slender
as
he
raised
his
arms
for
his
smashing
service
it
was
not
young
vereker
but
michael
serious
and
beautiful
when
young
parsons
leaped
high
into
the
air
and
thus
returned
anthony
facetious
on
the
volley
that
was
nicky
when
young
norris
turned
and
ran
at
the
top
of
his
speed
and
overtook
the
ball
on
its
rebound
from
the
base
line
where
young
vereker
had
planted
it
when
as
by
a
miracle
he
sent
it
backwards
over
his
own
head
paralysing
vereker
and
parsons
with
sheer
astonishment
that
was
john
her
vision
passed
she
was
leaning
over
nicky
now
nicky
so
small
in
the
big
bed
nicky
had
moaned
does
it
count
if
i
make
that
little
noise
mummy
it
sort
of
lets
the
pain
out
no
my
lamb
it
does
count
is
the
pain
very
bad
yes
mummy
awful
it
going
faster
and
faster
and
it
bizzes
and
when
it
does
bizz
it
thumps
he
paused
i
think
i
could
bear
it
better
if
i
sat
on
your
knee
frances
thought
she
could
bear
it
better
too
it
would
be
good
for
nicky
that
he
should
grow
into
beautiful
adolescence
and
a
perfect
manhood
but
it
was
better
for
her
that
he
should
be
a
baby
still
that
she
should
have
him
on
her
knee
and
hold
him
close
to
her
that
she
should
feel
his
adorable
body
press
quivering
against
her
body
and
the
heat
of
his
earache
penetrating
her
cool
flesh
for
now
she
was
lost
to
herself
and
utterly
absorbed
in
nicky
and
her
agony
became
a
sort
of
ecstasy
as
if
actually
she
bore
his
pain
it
was
anthony
who
could
not
stand
it
anthony
had
come
in
on
his
way
to
his
as
he
looked
at
nicky
his
handsome
face
was
drawn
with
a
dreadful
yearning
ineffectual
pity
frances
had
discovered
that
her
husband
could
both
be
and
look
pathetic
he
had
wanted
her
to
be
sorry
for
him
and
she
was
sorry
for
him
because
his
male
pity
was
all
agony
there
was
no
ecstasy
in
it
of
any
sort
at
all
nicky
was
far
more
her
flesh
and
blood
than
he
was
anthony
nicky
stirred
in
his
mother
lap
he
raised
his
head
and
when
he
saw
that
queer
look
on
his
father
face
he
smiled
at
it
he
had
to
make
the
smile
himself
for
it
refused
to
come
of
its
own
accord
he
made
it
carefully
so
that
it
should
hurt
him
but
he
made
it
so
well
that
it
hurt
frances
and
anthony
i
never
saw
a
child
bear
pain
as
nicky
does
frances
said
in
her
pride
if
he
can
bear
it
ca
said
anthony
and
he
stalked
into
his
and
shut
the
door
on
himself
daddy
minds
more
than
you
do
said
frances
at
that
nicky
sat
up
his
eyes
glittered
and
his
cheeks
burned
with
the
fever
of
his
earache
i
do
mind
he
said
really
and
truly
i
do
mind
i
do
care
if
my
ear
ache
it
my
eyes
is
crying
not
me
at
nine
when
they
were
all
sitting
down
to
dinner
nicky
sent
for
his
father
and
mother
something
had
happened
crackers
he
said
had
been
going
off
in
his
ears
and
they
hurt
most
awfully
and
when
it
had
done
cracking
his
earache
had
gone
away
and
dorothy
had
brought
him
a
trumpet
from
rosalind
party
and
michael
a
tin
train
and
michael
had
given
him
the
train
and
he
would
take
the
trumpet
instead
ought
michael
to
have
had
the
trumpet
and
when
they
left
him
tucked
up
in
his
cot
in
the
night
nursery
he
called
them
back
again
it
was
a
jolly
sell
for
me
was
it
said
nicky
and
he
laughed
iv
it
seemed
that
nicky
would
always
be
like
that
whatever
happened
and
something
was
generally
happening
to
him
he
did
care
when
he
scaled
the
plaster
on
the
terrace
and
it
gave
way
under
his
assault
and
threw
him
down
the
steps
on
to
the
gravel
walk
he
picked
himself
up
displaying
a
forehead
that
was
a
red
abrasion
filled
in
with
yellow
gravel
and
the
grey
dust
of
the
smashed
and
said
i
care
i
liked
it
before
anybody
had
time
to
pity
him
when
stepped
on
his
train
and
broke
the
tender
he
said
it
all
right
i
do
care
i
shall
make
another
it
was
no
use
grannie
saying
care
came
to
a
bad
end
nicky
made
it
evident
that
a
bad
end
would
be
life
last
challenge
not
to
care
no
accident
however
unforeseen
would
ever
take
him
at
a
disadvantage
two
years
passed
and
he
was
just
the
same
frances
and
anthony
agreed
behind
his
back
that
nicky
was
adorable
but
his
peculiar
attitude
to
misfortune
became
embarrassing
when
you
had
to
punish
him
nicky
could
break
the
back
of
any
punishment
by
first
admitting
that
it
was
a
good
idea
and
then
thinking
of
a
better
one
when
it
was
too
late
it
was
a
good
idea
not
letting
him
have
any
cake
for
tea
after
he
had
tested
the
resilience
of
the
new
tyres
on
his
bicycle
with
a
penknife
but
nicky
said
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
if
they
had
taken
his
from
him
for
a
week
you
did
think
of
that
did
you
mummy
i
thought
of
it
said
nicky
once
he
ran
away
over
the
west
heath
and
got
into
the
leg
of
mutton
pond
and
would
have
been
drowned
if
a
total
stranger
had
gone
in
after
him
and
pulled
him
out
that
time
nicky
was
sent
to
bed
at
four
in
the
afternoon
at
seven
when
his
mother
came
to
tuck
him
up
and
say
she
found
him
sitting
up
smiling
and
ready
mummy
he
said
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
it
is
a
bit
of
good
sending
me
to
bed
i
should
have
thought
it
was
myself
said
frances
she
almost
suspected
nicky
of
insincerity
so
it
would
have
been
he
assented
if
i
did
things
you
see
i
just
lie
still
things
all
the
time
i
three
things
since
tea
a
thing
to
make
daddy
bikesickle
stand
still
with
daddy
on
it
a
thing
to
squeeze
corks
out
of
bottles
and
a
thing
to
make
my
go
faster
that
is
a
punishment
is
it
mummy
they
said
that
nicky
would
grow
out
of
it
but
two
more
years
passed
and
nicky
was
still
the
same
and
yet
he
was
not
the
same
and
dorothy
and
michael
and
john
were
not
the
same
for
the
awful
thing
about
your
children
was
that
they
were
always
dying
yes
dying
the
baby
nicky
was
dead
the
child
dorothy
was
dead
and
in
her
place
was
a
strange
big
girl
the
child
michael
was
dead
and
in
his
place
was
a
strange
big
boy
and
frances
mourned
over
the
passing
of
each
age
you
could
no
more
bring
back
that
unique
loveliness
of
two
years
old
of
five
years
old
of
seven
than
you
could
bring
back
the
dead
even
was
not
a
baby
any
more
he
spoke
another
language
and
had
other
feelings
he
had
no
particular
affection
for
his
knee
frances
knew
that
all
this
dying
was
to
give
place
to
a
more
wonderful
and
a
stronger
life
but
it
was
not
the
same
life
and
she
wanted
to
have
all
their
lives
about
her
enduring
going
on
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
yet
know
that
the
mother
of
babies
and
the
mother
of
boys
and
girls
must
die
if
the
mother
of
men
and
women
is
to
be
born
thoughts
came
to
frances
now
that
troubled
her
tranquillity
supposing
after
all
the
children
should
grow
up
as
she
wanted
them
to
there
was
nicky
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
she
could
make
no
impression
on
him
there
was
michael
she
could
make
him
out
he
loved
them
and
showed
that
he
loved
them
but
it
was
by
caresses
by
beautiful
words
by
rare
extravagant
acts
of
renunciation
inconsistent
with
his
not
by
anything
solid
and
continuous
there
was
a
softness
in
michael
that
distressed
and
a
hardness
that
perplexed
her
you
could
make
an
impression
on
michael
far
too
easily
and
the
impression
stayed
you
could
obliterate
it
michael
memory
was
terrible
and
he
had
secret
ways
he
was
growing
more
and
more
sensitive
more
and
more
wrapped
up
in
himself
supposing
michael
became
a
morbid
egoist
like
brother
bartholomew
and
there
was
dorothy
she
went
her
own
way
more
than
ever
with
the
absolute
conviction
that
it
was
the
right
way
nothing
could
turn
her
at
thirteen
her
body
was
no
longer
obedient
dorothy
was
not
going
to
be
her
mother
companion
or
her
father
either
she
was
rosalind
jervis
companion
she
seemed
to
care
more
about
little
fat
fluffy
rosalind
than
about
any
of
them
except
nicky
dorothy
was
interested
in
michael
she
respected
his
queer
thoughts
it
was
as
if
she
recognized
some
power
in
him
that
could
beat
her
somewhere
some
day
and
was
humble
before
a
thing
her
cleverness
had
failed
to
understand
but
it
was
nicky
that
she
adored
not
michael
and
she
was
bad
for
nicky
she
encouraged
his
naughtiness
because
it
amused
her
frances
foresaw
that
a
time
would
come
a
little
later
when
nicky
and
dorothy
would
be
companions
not
nicky
and
his
mother
in
the
evenings
coming
home
from
the
frances
and
anthony
discussed
their
children
frances
said
you
ca
make
any
impression
on
nicky
there
seems
to
be
no
way
that
you
can
get
at
him
anthony
thought
there
was
a
way
it
was
a
way
he
had
not
tried
yet
that
he
did
not
want
to
try
but
if
he
could
only
bring
himself
to
it
he
judged
that
he
could
make
a
distinct
impression
what
the
young
rascal
wants
is
a
thorough
good
spanking
said
anthony
nicky
said
so
too
the
first
time
he
got
it
nicky
criticism
was
that
it
was
a
bad
idea
if
his
father
could
have
pulled
it
off
all
right
but
he
said
it
no
good
if
you
do
it
through
the
cloth
and
it
no
good
unless
you
to
hurt
me
daddy
and
you
do
want
and
even
if
you
did
want
badly
enough
to
try
and
hurt
supposing
you
spanked
ever
so
hard
you
hurt
as
much
as
my
earache
and
i
can
bear
that
he
top
dog
again
you
see
said
frances
not
without
a
secret
satisfaction
oh
is
he
said
anthony
i
do
propose
to
be
downed
by
nicky
every
instinct
in
him
revolted
against
spanking
nicky
but
when
williams
the
groom
showed
him
a
graze
on
each
knee
of
the
pony
he
had
bought
for
frances
and
the
children
anthony
determined
that
this
time
nicky
should
have
a
serious
spanking
which
of
them
took
roger
out
i
sure
i
do
know
sir
said
williams
but
anthony
knew
he
lay
in
wait
for
nicky
by
the
door
that
led
from
the
stable
yard
into
the
kitchen
garden
nicky
was
in
the
strawberry
bed
was
it
you
who
took
roger
out
this
afternoon
nicky
did
not
answer
promptly
his
mouth
was
still
full
of
strawberries
what
if
i
did
he
said
at
last
after
manifest
reflection
if
you
did
why
you
let
him
down
on
golders
hill
and
cut
his
knees
holly
mount
said
nicky
holly
mount
or
golders
hill
it
all
the
same
to
you
you
young
monkey
it
is
daddy
holly
mount
much
the
worst
it
an
awful
hill
that
said
anthony
is
why
you
forbidden
to
ride
down
it
to
be
spanked
for
this
nicky
have
i
all
right
do
look
so
unhappy
daddy
anthony
did
much
better
this
time
nicky
though
he
shook
with
laughter
owned
it
very
handsomely
and
anthony
had
handicapped
himself
again
by
doing
it
through
the
cloth
he
drew
the
line
at
shaming
nicky
yet
you
have
shamed
his
indomitable
impudence
but
he
had
done
it
he
had
done
it
ruthlessly
while
the
strawberries
were
still
wet
on
nicky
mouth
and
when
it
was
all
over
michael
looking
for
his
father
came
into
the
where
these
things
happened
he
said
he
was
awfully
sorry
but
he
taken
roger
out
and
roger
had
gone
down
on
his
knees
and
cut
himself
no
it
was
on
holly
mount
it
was
at
the
turn
of
the
road
on
the
hill
past
the
spaniards
anthony
paid
no
attention
to
michael
he
turned
on
michael
brother
nicky
what
did
you
do
it
for
for
a
rag
of
course
i
knew
you
feel
such
a
jolly
fool
when
you
found
it
was
me
you
see
daddy
he
explained
later
you
might
have
known
i
have
let
roger
down
but
was
it
a
ripping
sell
what
are
you
to
do
said
anthony
with
a
boy
like
that
frances
had
an
inspiration
do
nothing
she
said
her
tranquillity
refused
to
be
troubled
for
long
together
nicky
right
it
no
good
trying
to
punish
him
after
all
punish
nicky
it
is
as
if
he
was
really
naughty
he
never
does
unkind
things
or
mean
things
and
he
truthful
horribly
truthful
they
all
are
said
anthony
well
then
what
does
nicky
do
he
does
dangerous
things
he
forgets
nothing
more
dangerous
than
forgetting
we
must
punish
him
to
make
him
remember
but
it
does
make
him
remember
it
only
makes
him
think
us
fools
you
know
what
it
means
said
anthony
we
shall
have
to
send
him
to
school
not
yet
said
frances
school
was
the
thing
in
the
future
that
she
dreaded
nicky
was
only
nine
and
they
were
all
getting
on
well
with
mt
parsons
anthony
knew
that
to
send
nicky
to
school
now
would
be
punishing
frances
not
nicky
the
little
fiend
would
only
grin
in
their
faces
if
they
told
him
he
was
going
to
school
it
was
no
use
trying
to
make
impressions
on
nicky
he
was
as
hard
as
nails
he
would
never
feel
things
perhaps
frances
thought
it
was
just
as
well
v
i
do
think
it
was
nice
of
jane
said
nicky
to
have
jerry
and
i
do
think
it
was
nice
of
me
said
dorothy
to
give
him
to
you
jane
was
dorothy
cat
therefore
her
kittens
were
dorothy
i
would
have
given
him
to
just
anybody
i
know
said
nicky
i
might
have
kept
him
he
the
nicest
kitten
jane
ever
had
i
know
said
nicky
it
nice
of
you
i
might
want
him
back
again
i
know
nicky
was
quiet
and
serious
almost
humble
as
if
he
went
in
the
fear
of
losing
jerry
nobody
but
jerry
and
dorothy
saw
nicky
in
that
mood
not
that
he
was
really
afraid
nothing
could
take
jerry
from
him
if
dorothy
could
have
taken
him
back
again
she
would
have
not
even
if
she
had
really
wanted
him
dorothy
was
cruel
and
she
was
only
ragging
but
certainly
he
was
jane
nicest
kitten
jane
was
white
with
untidy
tabby
patterns
on
her
jerry
was
black
all
over
whatever
attitude
he
took
his
tight
short
fur
kept
the
outlines
of
his
figure
firm
and
clear
whether
he
arched
his
back
and
jumped
sideways
or
rolled
himself
into
a
cushion
or
squatted
with
haunches
spread
and
paws
doubled
in
under
his
breast
or
sat
bolt
upright
with
his
four
legs
straight
like
pillars
and
his
tail
curled
about
his
feet
jerry
coat
shone
like
black
and
the
top
of
his
head
smelt
sweet
like
a
dove
breast
and
he
had
yellow
eyes
said
they
would
turn
green
some
day
but
nicky
did
believe
it
was
only
ragging
jerry
eyes
would
always
be
yellow
parsons
declared
that
nicky
sat
for
whole
hours
meditating
on
jerry
as
if
in
this
way
he
could
make
him
last
longer
jerry
life
was
wonderful
to
nicky
once
he
was
so
small
that
his
body
covered
hardly
the
palm
of
your
hand
you
could
see
his
skin
it
felt
soft
and
weak
through
the
thin
fur
sleeked
flat
and
wet
where
jane
had
licked
it
his
eyes
were
buttoned
up
tight
then
they
opened
he
crawled
feebly
on
the
floor
after
jane
or
hung
on
to
her
little
breasts
pressing
out
the
milk
with
his
clever
paws
then
jerry
got
older
sometimes
he
went
mad
and
became
a
bat
or
a
bird
and
flew
up
the
curtains
as
if
his
legs
were
wings
nicky
said
that
jerry
could
turn
himself
into
anything
he
pleased
a
hawk
an
owl
a
dove
a
himalayan
bear
a
snake
a
flying
squirrel
a
monkey
a
rabbit
a
panther
and
a
little
black
lamb
of
god
jerry
was
a
cat
now
he
was
two
years
old
jerry
fixed
idea
seemed
to
be
that
he
was
a
very
young
cat
and
that
he
must
be
nursed
continually
and
that
nobody
but
nicky
must
nurse
him
parsons
found
that
nicky
made
surprising
progress
in
his
latin
and
greek
that
year
what
had
baffled
parsons
up
till
now
had
been
nicky
incapacity
for
sitting
still
but
he
would
sit
still
enough
when
jerry
was
on
his
knee
pressed
tight
between
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
nicky
stomach
so
that
knowledge
entered
into
nicky
through
jerry
when
there
was
no
other
way
nicky
would
even
sit
still
in
the
open
air
to
watch
jerry
as
he
stalked
bees
in
the
grass
or
played
by
himself
over
and
over
again
his
own
enchanted
game
he
always
played
it
in
the
same
way
he
started
from
the
same
clump
in
the
border
to
run
in
one
long
careening
curve
across
the
grass
at
the
same
spot
in
the
lawn
he
bounded
sideways
and
gave
the
same
little
barking
grunt
and
dashed
off
into
the
bushes
when
you
tried
to
catch
him
midway
he
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
bowed
to
you
slantwise
waving
his
forepaws
or
rushed
like
lightning
up
the
tree
of
heaven
and
climbed
into
the
highest
branches
and
clung
there
looking
down
at
you
his
yellow
eyes
shone
through
the
green
leaves
they
quivered
they
played
they
mocked
you
with
some
challenge
some
charm
secret
and
divine
and
savage
the
soul
of
nicky
is
in
that
cat
frances
said
jerry
knew
that
he
was
nicky
cat
when
other
people
caught
him
he
scrabbled
over
their
shoulders
with
his
claws
and
got
away
from
them
when
nicky
caught
him
he
lay
quiet
and
heavy
in
his
arms
pressing
down
and
spreading
his
soft
body
nicky
sense
of
touch
had
been
hardened
by
violent
impacts
and
collisions
by
experiments
with
and
saws
and
chisels
and
gouges
and
by
struggling
with
the
material
of
his
everlasting
inventions
through
communion
with
jerry
it
became
tender
and
sensitive
again
it
delighted
in
the
cat
throbbing
purr
and
the
thrill
of
his
feet
as
jerry
serious
and
earnest
padded
down
his
bed
on
nicky
knee
i
like
him
best
though
said
nicky
when
he
sleepy
and
at
the
same
time
bitesome
you
must
let
him
bite
you
frances
said
i
do
mind
said
nicky
he
would
do
it
if
he
did
like
me
jerry
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
with
his
jaws
closing
drowsily
on
arm
when
it
moved
his
hind
legs
kicked
at
it
and
tore
he
dreaming
when
he
does
that
said
nicky
he
thinks
he
a
panther
and
i
buffaloes
parsons
laughed
at
him
nicky
and
his
cat
he
said
nicky
care
parsons
was
always
ragging
him
the
tutor
preferred
dogs
himself
he
could
afford
any
of
the
expensive
breeds
but
that
summer
he
was
taking
care
of
a
russian
wolfhound
for
a
friend
of
his
when
parsons
ran
with
michael
and
nicky
round
the
heath
the
great
borzoi
ran
before
them
with
long
leaps
head
downwards
setting
an
impossible
pace
michael
and
dorothy
adored
boris
openly
nicky
out
of
loyalty
to
jerry
stifled
a
secret
admiration
for
parsons
held
that
a
devotion
to
a
cat
was
incompatible
with
a
proper
feeling
for
a
dog
whence
nicky
had
inferred
that
any
feeling
for
a
dog
must
do
violence
to
the
nobler
passion
parsons
tried
to
wean
nicky
from
what
he
pretended
to
regard
as
his
unmanly
weakness
wait
nicky
he
said
till
you
got
a
dog
of
your
own
i
do
want
a
dog
of
my
own
said
nicky
i
do
want
anything
but
jerry
boris
he
said
was
not
clever
like
jerry
he
had
a
silly
face
think
so
said
parsons
look
at
his
jaws
they
could
break
jerry
back
with
one
snap
he
daddy
they
were
at
tea
on
the
lawn
and
boris
had
gone
to
sleep
under
parsons
legs
with
his
long
muzzle
on
his
forepaws
he
could
said
anthony
if
he
caught
him
but
he
could
catch
him
jerry
be
up
a
tree
before
boris
could
look
at
him
if
you
want
jerry
to
shin
up
trees
you
must
keep
his
weight
down
nicky
laughed
he
knew
that
boris
could
never
catch
jerry
his
father
was
only
ragging
him
nicky
was
in
the
schoolroom
bowed
over
his
desk
he
was
doing
an
imposition
the
second
aorist
of
the
abominable
verb
greek
erchomai
written
out
five
and
twenty
times
luckily
he
could
do
the
last
fifteen
times
from
memory
nicky
had
been
arguing
with
parsons
parsons
had
said
that
the
second
aorist
of
greek
erchomai
was
not
greek
êrchon
nicky
had
said
i
ca
help
it
if
it
not
greek
êrchon
it
ought
to
be
parsons
had
replied
the
verb
greek
erchomai
is
irregular
and
nicky
had
retorted
in
effect
that
no
verb
had
any
business
to
be
as
irregular
as
all
that
parsons
had
then
suggested
that
nicky
might
know
more
about
the
business
of
irregular
verbs
if
he
wrote
out
the
second
aorist
of
greek
erchomai
five
and
twenty
times
after
tea
as
it
was
a
particularly
fine
afternoon
an
imposition
was
nicky
admitted
a
score
for
parsons
and
a
jolly
good
sell
for
parsons
had
not
allowed
him
to
have
jerry
on
his
knee
or
even
in
the
room
and
this
nicky
owned
further
was
but
just
it
would
have
been
nearly
so
good
a
punishment
if
he
had
had
jerry
with
him
nicky
bowed
over
his
desk
struggled
for
the
perfect
legibility
which
parsons
had
insisted
on
as
otherwise
the
imposition
would
do
him
more
harm
than
good
he
was
in
for
it
and
the
thing
must
be
done
honourably
if
it
was
done
at
all
he
had
only
looked
out
of
the
windows
twice
to
make
sure
that
boris
was
asleep
under
parsons
legs
and
once
he
had
left
the
room
to
see
where
jerry
was
he
had
found
him
in
the
kitchen
garden
sitting
on
a
bed
of
mustard
and
cress
ruining
it
he
sat
like
a
lamb
his
forepaws
crossed
his
head
tilted
slightly
backwards
his
yellow
eyes
gazed
at
nicky
with
a
sweet
and
mournful
innocence
nicky
did
not
hear
the
voices
in
the
garden
i
awfully
sorry
sir
parsons
was
saying
i
ca
think
how
it
could
have
happened
parsons
voice
was
thick
and
his
face
was
very
red
i
could
have
sworn
the
door
was
shut
johnnie
opened
it
said
anthony
he
seemed
to
have
caught
suddenly
one
of
his
bad
colds
and
to
be
giving
it
to
parsons
they
were
both
in
their
shirtsleeves
and
anthony
carried
something
in
his
arms
which
he
had
covered
with
his
coat
the
borzoi
stood
in
front
of
them
his
face
had
a
look
of
foolish
ecstasy
he
stared
at
parsons
and
as
he
stared
he
panted
there
was
a
red
smear
on
his
white
breast
his
open
jaws
still
dripped
a
pink
slaver
it
sprayed
the
ground
in
front
of
them
jerked
out
with
his
panting
get
away
you
damned
brute
said
parsons
boris
abashed
himself
he
stretched
out
his
fore
legs
towards
parsons
shook
his
raised
haunches
lifted
up
his
great
muzzle
and
rolled
into
one
monstrous
cry
a
bark
a
howl
a
yawn
nicky
heard
it
and
he
looked
out
of
the
schoolroom
window
he
saw
the
red
smear
on
the
white
curly
breast
he
saw
his
father
in
his
shirt
sleeves
carrying
something
in
his
arms
that
he
had
covered
with
his
coat
under
the
tree
of
heaven
dorothy
and
michael
crouching
close
against
their
mother
cried
quietly
frances
was
crying
too
for
it
was
she
who
would
have
to
tell
nicky
dorothy
tried
to
console
him
jerry
eyes
would
have
turned
green
if
he
had
lived
nicky
they
would
really
i
would
have
minded
they
have
been
jerry
eyes
but
he
would
have
looked
like
jerry
i
would
have
cared
what
he
looked
like
he
have
jerry
i
give
you
jane
nicky
and
all
the
kittens
she
ever
has
if
that
would
make
up
it
would
you
do
seem
to
understand
that
it
jerry
i
want
i
wish
you
would
talk
about
him
very
well
said
dorothy
i
wo
then
grannie
tried
she
recommended
a
holy
resignation
god
she
said
had
given
jerry
to
nicky
and
god
had
taken
him
away
he
did
give
him
me
and
he
no
right
to
take
him
dorothy
have
done
it
she
was
only
ragging
but
when
god
does
things
said
nicky
savagely
it
is
a
rag
he
hated
grannie
and
he
hated
parsons
and
he
hated
god
but
he
loved
dorothy
who
had
given
him
jerry
night
after
night
frances
held
him
in
her
arms
at
while
nicky
said
the
same
thing
if
if
i
could
stop
seeing
him
but
i
keep
on
seeing
him
when
he
sat
on
the
mustard
and
cress
and
when
he
bit
me
with
his
and
when
he
looked
at
me
out
of
the
tree
of
heaven
then
i
hear
that
little
barking
grunt
he
used
to
make
when
he
was
playing
with
himself
when
he
dashed
off
into
the
bushes
and
i
ca
it
night
after
night
nicky
cried
himself
to
sleep
for
the
awful
thing
was
that
it
had
been
all
his
fault
if
he
had
kept
jerry
weight
down
boris
could
have
caught
him
daddy
said
so
mummy
over
and
over
again
frances
said
it
was
your
fault
it
was
he
left
the
door
open
surely
you
can
forgive
over
and
over
again
nicky
said
i
do
forgive
him
but
it
was
no
good
nicky
became
first
supernaturally
subdued
and
gentle
then
ill
they
had
to
take
him
away
from
home
away
from
the
sight
of
the
garden
and
away
from
parsons
forestalling
the
midsummer
holidays
by
two
months
nicky
at
the
seaside
was
troublesome
and
happy
and
they
thought
he
had
forgotten
but
on
the
first
evening
at
hampstead
as
frances
kissed
him
he
said
shall
i
have
to
see
parsons
frances
said
yes
of
course
i
rather
not
nonsense
you
must
get
over
that
i
ca
mummy
oh
nicky
ca
you
forgive
poor
parsons
when
he
was
so
unhappy
nicky
meditated
do
you
think
he
said
at
last
he
really
minded
i
sure
he
did
as
much
as
you
and
daddy
quite
as
much
then
said
nicky
i
forgive
him
but
though
he
forgave
john
and
parsons
and
even
god
who
to
do
him
justice
did
not
seem
to
have
been
able
to
help
it
nicky
did
not
forgive
himself
yet
frances
never
could
think
why
the
sight
of
mustard
and
cress
made
nicky
sick
neither
did
parsons
nor
any
schoolmaster
who
came
after
him
understand
why
when
nicky
knew
all
the
rest
of
the
verb
greek
erchomai
by
heart
he
was
unable
to
remember
the
second
aorist
he
excellent
memory
but
there
was
always
a
gap
in
it
just
there
vi
in
that
peace
and
tranquillity
where
nothing
ever
happened
violent
death
would
have
counted
as
an
event
a
date
to
reckon
by
but
for
three
memorable
things
that
happened
one
after
another
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
the
return
of
frances
brother
maurice
fleming
from
australia
where
anthony
had
sent
him
two
years
ago
on
the
express
understanding
that
he
was
to
stay
there
the
simultaneous
arrival
of
anthony
brother
bartholomew
and
his
family
and
the
outbreak
of
the
boer
war
the
return
of
morrie
was
not
altogether
unforeseen
and
bartholomew
had
announced
his
coming
well
beforehand
but
who
could
have
dreamed
that
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
england
would
be
engaged
in
a
war
that
really
a
war
frances
with
the
in
her
hands
supposed
that
that
meant
more
meddling
and
muddling
of
stupid
politicians
and
that
it
would
mean
more
silly
speeches
in
parliament
and
copy
at
last
for
foolish
violent
pathetic
and
desperate
editors
and
breach
of
promise
cases
divorces
and
fires
in
paraffin
shops
reduced
to
momentary
insignificance
but
as
yet
there
was
no
war
nor
any
appearance
that
sensible
people
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
war
at
the
time
of
morrie
return
it
stood
alone
as
other
past
returns
the
return
from
bombay
the
return
from
canada
the
return
from
cape
colony
had
stood
in
its
sheer
awfulness
to
frances
it
represented
the
extremity
of
disaster
they
might
have
known
what
was
coming
by
grannie
behaviour
one
day
the
day
when
the
australian
mail
arrived
she
had
subsided
suddenly
into
a
state
of
softness
and
gentleness
she
approached
her
with
an
air
of
sorrowful
deprecation
she
showed
a
certain
deference
to
her
daughter
louie
she
was
soft
and
gentle
even
with
emmeline
and
edith
fleming
broke
the
news
to
louie
who
broke
it
to
frances
who
in
her
turn
broke
it
to
anthony
that
was
the
procedure
they
invariably
adopted
i
wonder
grannie
said
what
he
can
be
coming
back
for
each
time
she
affected
astonishment
and
incredulity
as
if
morrie
coming
back
were
not
a
recurrence
that
crushed
you
with
its
flatness
and
staleness
but
a
thing
that
must
interest
louie
because
of
its
utter
i
wonder
said
louie
why
he
has
come
before
what
else
did
you
expect
i
sure
i
do
know
said
grannie
helplessly
go
and
tell
frances
louie
went
and
because
she
knew
that
the
burden
of
morrie
would
fall
again
on
frances
husband
she
was
disagreeable
with
frances
it
all
very
well
for
you
she
said
you
have
got
to
live
with
him
you
have
got
to
sleep
in
the
room
next
him
you
do
know
what
it
like
i
do
know
said
frances
i
remember
you
have
to
bear
it
you
have
had
to
bear
it
for
fourteen
years
you
have
to
bear
it
frances
repeated
till
anthony
sends
him
out
again
that
all
it
amounts
to
she
waited
till
the
children
were
in
bed
and
she
was
alone
with
anthony
something
awful
happened
she
said
and
paused
hoping
he
would
guess
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
do
tell
me
if
it
that
nicky
been
taking
my
new
bike
to
pieces
it
is
nicky
it
maurice
anthony
got
up
and
cleared
his
pipe
thoroughly
and
deliberately
she
wondered
whether
he
had
heard
i
no
business
to
have
married
you
to
have
let
you
in
for
him
why
what
he
been
up
to
now
he
coming
home
so
said
anthony
is
bartholomew
i
no
business
to
have
let
you
in
for
do
worry
frances
if
morrie
comes
home
he
be
sent
out
again
that
all
at
your
expense
i
do
grudge
any
expense
in
sending
morrie
out
nor
in
keeping
him
out
yes
but
this
time
it
different
it
worse
why
worse
because
of
the
children
they
older
now
than
they
were
last
time
they
understand
what
if
they
do
they
must
learn
anthony
said
to
realize
facts
they
realized
them
rather
sooner
than
he
had
expected
nobody
but
louie
had
allowed
for
the
possibility
of
morrie
sailing
by
the
same
steamer
as
his
letter
and
louie
had
argued
that
if
he
had
done
so
he
was
bound
either
to
have
arrived
before
the
letter
or
to
have
sent
a
wire
therefore
they
had
at
least
a
clear
five
days
of
peace
before
them
anthony
thought
he
had
shown
wisdom
when
the
next
morning
which
was
a
wednesday
he
sent
grannie
and
the
aunties
to
eastbourne
for
a
week
so
that
they
should
worry
frances
and
when
on
thursday
he
made
her
go
with
him
for
a
long
day
in
the
country
to
take
her
mind
off
morrie
they
came
back
at
nine
in
the
evening
and
found
dorothy
michael
and
nicholas
sitting
up
for
them
michael
and
nicky
were
excited
but
dorothy
looked
and
important
uncle
morrie
come
they
said
dorothy
saw
him
first
nicky
let
him
in
he
had
got
a
hat
on
we
kept
him
in
the
schoolroom
till
nanna
could
come
and
put
him
to
bed
he
was
crying
because
he
been
to
grannie
house
and
there
anybody
there
and
because
he
lost
the
he
brought
for
auntie
emmy
and
because
he
could
remember
which
of
us
was
dead
no
mummy
nobody
seen
him
but
us
and
nanna
nanna
with
him
now
uncle
morrie
never
accounted
even
to
himself
for
the
time
he
had
spent
between
the
arrival
of
his
ship
at
tilbury
on
sunday
morning
and
that
saturday
afternoon
neither
could
he
remember
what
had
become
of
his
luggage
or
whether
he
had
ever
had
any
only
the
county
council
man
going
his
last
rounds
in
the
farthest
places
of
the
heath
came
upon
a
small
bundle
tied
in
a
blue
handkerchief
a
cap
belonging
to
boulger
of
the
a
cage
of
and
a
distinct
impression
of
a
recumbent
human
form
on
the
grass
together
under
a
young
birch
tree
in
the
stuffy
little
house
behind
the
judge
walk
the
four
women
lived
now
under
male
protection
when
they
crossed
the
heath
they
had
no
longer
any
need
to
borrow
anthony
from
frances
they
had
a
man
of
their
own
to
make
room
for
him
auntie
louie
and
her
were
turned
out
of
their
own
place
and
auntie
louie
had
to
sleep
in
grannie
bed
a
thing
she
hated
to
make
room
for
the
the
grey
parrot
was
turned
out
of
the
into
the
and
as
maurice
could
stand
either
the
noise
of
the
or
the
noises
of
the
parrot
he
found
both
the
and
the
uninhabitable
day
after
day
dorothy
and
michael
and
nicky
on
the
terrace
looked
out
for
his
coming
only
extreme
distance
made
uncle
morrie
figure
small
and
harmless
and
pathetic
day
after
day
he
presented
himself
with
an
air
of
distinction
and
assurance
flushed
and
a
little
battered
but
still
handsome
wearing
a
spruce
grey
suit
and
a
panama
hat
bought
with
anthony
money
in
australia
he
had
infinitely
preferred
the
cape
mounted
police
had
ruined
maurice
nerves
he
was
good
for
nothing
but
to
lounge
in
anthony
garden
to
ride
his
horses
it
was
his
riding
that
had
got
him
into
the
cape
mounted
police
to
sit
at
his
table
and
drink
his
wines
and
when
there
was
no
more
wine
for
him
to
turn
into
jack
straw
castle
for
a
on
his
way
home
and
before
july
was
out
three
others
were
added
to
the
garden
group
bartholomew
and
vera
and
veronica
and
after
them
a
fourth
friend
captain
ferdinand
cameron
home
on
sick
leave
before
anybody
expected
him
frances
tree
of
heaven
sheltered
them
all
vii
bartholomew
anthony
brother
lived
in
bombay
and
looked
after
his
business
for
him
in
the
east
he
had
something
the
matter
with
him
and
he
had
come
home
to
look
after
his
own
health
at
least
health
was
what
he
was
supposed
to
be
looking
after
but
dorothy
had
heard
her
father
say
that
bartie
had
come
home
to
look
after
vera
vera
was
bartie
wife
and
veronica
mother
before
she
became
bartholomew
harrison
she
had
been
frances
schoolfellow
and
her
dearest
friend
frances
fleming
had
been
her
bridesmaid
and
had
met
anthony
for
the
first
time
at
vera
wedding
when
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
when
they
stayed
together
in
bartholomew
house
before
bartholomew
took
vera
to
bombay
bartie
had
not
been
married
ten
months
before
he
wanted
to
get
vera
out
of
england
and
vera
had
not
been
in
india
for
ten
weeks
before
he
wanted
her
to
go
back
they
were
always
coming
backwards
and
forwards
but
they
never
came
together
vera
would
be
sent
home
first
and
then
bartie
would
come
over
in
a
great
hurry
and
take
her
out
again
twelve
years
after
their
marriage
veronica
was
born
at
simla
and
the
coming
and
going
ceased
for
three
years
then
bartie
sent
them
both
home
that
time
vera
had
refused
to
travel
farther
westward
than
marseilles
she
was
afraid
of
damp
and
cold
and
she
had
got
the
doctor
to
order
her
to
the
riviera
she
and
veronica
had
been
living
for
two
years
in
a
small
villa
at
agaye
this
summer
she
had
come
to
england
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
damp
and
cold
and
bartie
followed
her
dorothy
and
michael
had
no
difficulty
in
remembering
vera
though
it
was
more
than
six
years
since
they
had
seen
her
for
vera
looked
the
same
her
hair
still
shone
like
leaves
her
face
had
still
the
same
colour
and
the
same
sweet
powdery
smell
and
if
these
things
had
changed
frances
would
still
have
known
her
by
her
forehead
that
looked
so
broad
because
her
eyebrows
and
her
eyes
were
so
long
and
by
her
fine
unfinished
passionate
mouth
by
her
pointed
chin
and
by
her
ways
but
though
her
ways
had
always
been
more
or
less
disagreeable
frances
was
not
prepared
for
the
shock
of
the
renewed
encounter
with
bartholomew
bartie
was
long
and
grey
and
lean
even
when
you
allowed
for
the
thickness
of
his
cholera
belt
he
wore
a
white
scarf
about
his
throat
for
his
idea
was
that
he
had
cancer
in
it
cancer
made
you
look
grey
he
too
had
the
face
of
a
hawk
of
a
tired
and
irritable
hawk
it
drooped
between
his
hunched
shoulders
his
chin
hanging
above
the
scarf
as
if
he
were
too
tired
or
too
irritable
to
hold
it
up
he
behaved
to
vera
and
veronica
as
if
it
was
they
who
had
worried
him
into
cancer
of
the
throat
they
who
tired
and
irritated
him
vera
talked
to
him
as
you
might
talk
to
a
sick
child
whose
peevishness
prolongs
unreasonably
its
pain
bartie
manner
almost
amounted
to
a
public
repudiation
of
her
the
whole
house
vibrated
to
the
shutting
of
his
door
at
time
yet
when
bartie
came
down
in
the
morning
late
and
more
morose
than
ever
vera
mouth
made
as
if
it
kissed
some
visionary
image
of
the
poor
thing
absurdity
she
did
believe
for
one
minute
in
his
cancer
it
was
an
excuse
for
the
shutting
of
his
door
she
kept
out
of
his
way
as
much
as
possible
yet
when
they
were
together
they
watched
each
other
they
watched
bartie
openly
with
sudden
dartings
and
swoopings
of
his
hawk
eyes
vera
furtively
her
eyes
were
so
large
and
long
that
without
turning
her
head
or
any
visible
movement
they
could
hold
his
image
but
for
captain
cameron
vera
eyes
had
a
full
open
gaze
spread
wide
apart
under
her
wide
forehead
they
were
like
dark
moth
wings
they
hovered
rested
flickering
vibrating
to
the
fine
tips
of
their
corners
whatever
had
been
the
matter
with
him
in
india
captain
cameron
had
recovered
his
keen
fair
highland
face
made
bartie
face
look
terrible
ferdie
was
charming
not
more
charming
to
bartie
wife
than
he
was
to
frances
not
more
charming
to
frances
than
to
her
sisters
so
that
even
louie
unbent
and
emmeline
and
edith
fell
in
love
with
him
he
flirted
with
frances
under
anthony
nose
and
with
the
aunties
under
grannie
nose
the
corners
of
vera
mouth
followed
the
tilt
of
her
long
eyes
corners
as
she
saw
him
do
it
you
could
not
think
of
vera
as
the
children
auntie
or
as
wife
or
as
veronica
mother
veronica
was
a
very
little
girl
who
sang
songs
and
was
afraid
of
ghosts
she
slept
in
her
mother
room
and
so
never
could
be
put
to
bed
till
seven
or
till
her
mother
was
dressed
to
the
last
hook
of
her
gown
the
last
hairpin
the
last
touch
of
powder
adhesive
without
bismuth
and
the
last
shadow
drawn
fine
about
her
eyelashes
when
vera
beautiful
in
a
beautiful
gown
came
trailing
into
the
room
where
everybody
waited
for
her
veronica
hid
herself
behind
uncle
big
chair
when
her
father
told
her
to
come
out
of
that
and
say
and
be
quick
about
it
she
came
slowly
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
bartie
showing
herself
bit
by
bit
hair
eyebrows
dark
under
her
gold
very
dark
against
her
white
sorrowful
transparent
lucid
eyes
a
little
girl
with
a
straight
white
face
a
little
slender
girl
in
a
straight
white
frock
she
stood
by
anthony
chair
spinning
out
the
time
smiling
at
him
with
her
childish
wavering
mouth
a
smile
that
would
not
spread
that
never
went
higher
than
the
tip
of
her
white
nose
that
left
her
lucid
transparent
eyes
still
sorrowful
she
knew
that
anthony
would
take
her
on
his
knee
and
that
she
could
sit
there
with
her
head
tucked
under
his
chin
smiling
at
him
prolonging
her
caresses
till
vera
told
him
to
put
her
down
and
let
her
go
bartie
growled
did
you
hear
your
mother
telling
you
to
say
yes
but
i
must
kiss
uncle
anthony
first
properly
once
on
his
mouth
once
on
his
nose
and
once
on
his
eyes
and
once
on
his
dear
little
ears
after
that
veronica
went
slowly
from
chair
to
chair
lingering
at
each
sitting
first
on
frances
lap
then
on
vera
spinning
out
her
caresses
that
spun
out
the
time
and
stretched
it
farther
and
farther
between
her
and
the
unearthly
hour
ahead
of
her
but
at
her
father
chair
she
did
not
linger
for
a
single
instant
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
hand
that
dropped
it
as
if
it
had
hurt
him
she
touched
his
forehead
with
her
small
mouth
pushed
out
absurdly
to
keep
her
face
as
far
as
possible
from
his
for
though
she
was
not
afraid
of
bartie
he
was
not
nice
either
to
sit
on
or
to
kiss
across
the
room
she
lingered
i
have
sung
bridge
is
broken
down
do
you
want
me
to
sing
it
no
darling
we
want
you
to
go
to
bed
i
going
mummy
and
at
the
door
she
turned
and
looked
at
them
with
her
sorrowful
lucid
transparent
eyes
then
she
went
leaving
the
door
open
behind
her
she
left
it
open
on
purpose
so
that
she
might
hear
their
voices
and
look
down
into
the
room
on
her
way
upstairs
besides
she
always
hoped
that
somebody
would
call
her
back
again
she
lingered
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
till
bartie
got
up
and
shut
the
door
on
her
she
lingered
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
and
on
the
landing
but
nobody
ever
called
her
back
again
and
nobody
but
nicky
knew
what
she
was
afraid
of
veronica
was
sitting
up
in
the
cot
that
used
to
be
nicky
when
he
was
little
nicky
rather
cold
in
his
pyjamas
sat
on
the
edge
of
it
beside
her
a
big
yellow
tremendous
moon
hung
in
the
sky
outside
the
window
behind
a
branch
of
the
tree
of
heaven
and
looked
at
them
veronica
crouched
sideways
on
her
pillow
in
a
corner
of
the
cot
her
legs
doubled
up
tight
under
her
tiny
body
her
shoulders
hunched
together
and
her
thin
arms
hanging
before
her
straight
to
her
lap
her
honey
coloured
hair
was
parted
and
gathered
into
two
funny
plaits
that
stuck
out
behind
her
ear
her
head
was
tilted
slightly
backwards
to
rest
against
the
rail
of
the
cot
she
looked
at
nicky
and
her
look
reminded
him
of
something
he
could
remember
what
were
you
ever
afraid
nicky
she
said
nicky
searched
his
memory
for
some
image
encircled
by
an
atmosphere
of
terror
and
found
there
a
white
hound
with
red
smears
on
his
breast
and
a
muzzle
like
two
saws
yes
he
said
i
was
once
a
lamb
a
white
lamb
was
what
veronica
looked
like
and
jerry
bad
looked
at
him
like
that
when
he
found
him
sitting
on
the
mustard
and
cress
the
day
boris
killed
him
afraid
what
of
i
do
know
that
it
was
exactly
would
you
be
afraid
of
a
ghost
now
if
you
saw
one
i
expect
i
jolly
well
should
if
i
saw
one
being
afraid
of
ghosts
does
count
does
it
no
of
course
it
does
you
are
afraid
as
long
as
i
here
are
you
no
i
shall
stay
then
till
you
go
to
sleep
night
after
night
he
heard
her
calling
to
him
nicky
i
frightened
nobody
but
veronica
and
nicky
were
ever
in
bed
on
that
floor
before
midnight
night
after
night
he
got
up
and
came
to
her
and
stayed
beside
her
till
she
went
to
sleep
once
he
said
if
it
was
michael
he
could
tell
you
stories
i
do
michael
i
want
you
in
the
she
went
about
looking
for
him
where
nicky
she
said
i
want
him
nicky
in
the
schoolroom
you
ca
have
him
but
i
him
ca
be
helped
you
must
do
without
him
will
he
be
very
long
yes
ever
so
long
run
away
like
a
good
little
girl
and
play
with
she
knew
that
they
told
her
to
play
with
because
she
was
a
little
girl
if
only
she
could
grow
big
quick
and
be
the
same
age
as
nicky
instead
of
running
away
and
playing
with
ronny
went
away
by
herself
into
the
house
to
wait
for
nicky
the
house
stood
on
the
at
the
far
end
of
the
kitchen
garden
the
had
had
no
apples
on
it
for
years
it
was
so
old
that
it
leaned
over
at
a
slant
it
stretched
out
two
great
boughs
like
twisted
arms
and
was
propped
up
by
a
wooden
post
under
each
armpit
the
breast
of
its
trunk
rested
on
a
the
posts
and
the
were
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
the
branches
were
its
roof
and
walls
anthony
had
given
it
to
veronica
to
live
in
and
veronica
had
given
it
to
nicky
it
was
nicky
and
ronny
house
the
others
were
only
visitors
who
were
not
expected
to
stay
there
was
room
enough
for
them
both
to
stand
up
inside
the
doorway
to
sit
down
in
the
middle
and
to
lie
flat
at
the
far
end
what
more
said
nicky
do
you
want
he
thought
that
everybody
would
be
sure
to
laugh
at
him
when
he
played
with
bonny
in
the
house
i
do
care
a
ram
if
they
do
he
said
but
nobody
ever
did
not
even
parsons
only
frances
when
she
passed
by
that
way
and
saw
nicky
and
bonny
sitting
cramped
and
close
under
their
smiled
unwillingly
but
her
smile
had
in
it
no
sort
of
mockery
at
all
nicky
wondered
why
is
it
said
dorothy
one
morning
that
ronny
does
look
as
if
she
was
uncle
bartie
daughter
or
that
uncle
bartie
looks
as
if
he
ronny
father
however
suddenly
and
wantonly
an
idea
struck
dorothy
she
brought
it
out
as
if
it
had
been
the
result
of
long
and
mature
consideration
or
is
it
said
vera
that
i
do
look
as
if
i
were
ronny
mother
her
eyes
had
opened
all
their
length
to
take
in
dorothy
no
i
think
it
is
that
uncle
bartie
looks
frances
rushed
in
it
does
matter
my
dear
what
you
think
it
will
some
day
said
dorothy
it
was
perhaps
the
best
thing
she
could
have
said
as
showing
that
she
was
more
interested
in
the
effect
she
would
produce
some
day
than
in
the
sensation
she
had
created
there
and
then
may
i
go
round
to
rosalind
after
lessons
you
may
and
may
i
stay
to
lunch
if
they
ask
me
you
may
stay
as
long
as
they
care
to
have
you
stay
to
tea
stay
to
dinner
if
you
like
dorothy
knew
by
the
behaviour
of
her
mother
face
that
she
had
scored
somewhere
somehow
she
also
knew
that
she
was
in
disgrace
and
yet
not
in
disgrace
which
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
was
a
funny
thing
about
this
time
frances
began
to
notice
a
symptom
in
herself
she
was
apt
to
resent
it
when
vera
discussed
her
children
with
her
one
late
afternoon
she
and
anthony
were
alone
with
vera
captain
cameron
had
not
come
round
that
day
and
bartie
had
gone
into
town
to
consult
either
his
solicitor
or
a
specialist
he
was
always
consulting
one
or
the
other
you
wrong
you
two
said
vera
you
think
michael
tender
and
nicky
hard
and
unimpressionable
michael
hard
you
wo
have
to
bother
about
michael
feelings
michael
feelings
said
frances
are
probably
what
i
shall
have
to
bother
about
more
than
anything
you
need
for
one
thing
they
be
so
unlike
your
feelings
that
you
wo
know
whether
they
feelings
at
all
you
wo
even
know
whether
he
having
them
or
not
nicky
the
one
you
have
to
look
out
for
he
go
all
the
howlers
i
do
think
that
nicky
be
very
susceptible
he
has
shown
any
great
signs
so
far
has
he
nicky
susceptibility
is
something
awful
my
dear
vera
you
say
yourself
you
do
care
about
children
and
that
you
do
understand
them
no
more
i
do
said
vera
but
i
understand
men
do
you
understand
veronica
of
course
i
do
i
said
men
veronica
a
girl
besides
veronica
mother
nicky
said
anthony
is
not
much
more
than
nine
you
keep
on
thinking
of
him
as
a
child
a
child
nothing
but
a
child
wait
till
nicky
has
children
of
his
own
then
you
know
they
would
be
rather
darlings
nicky
children
frances
said
so
would
veronica
you
need
be
frightened
nicky
affection
for
ronny
is
purely
paternal
i
not
frightened
said
frances
but
she
left
the
room
she
did
not
care
for
the
turn
the
talk
had
taken
besides
she
wanted
vera
to
see
that
she
was
not
afraid
to
leave
her
alone
with
anthony
i
glad
frances
has
gone
said
vera
because
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
never
have
known
each
other
if
it
had
been
for
me
she
have
married
you
it
was
i
who
saw
you
both
through
he
assented
and
you
said
if
there
was
ever
anything
you
could
do
for
me
you
have
by
any
chance
forgotten
i
have
not
well
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
but
my
dear
girl
what
happen
to
you
things
happen
anthony
yes
but
how
about
bartie
that
it
supposing
we
separated
good
heavens
you
not
contemplating
are
you
i
not
contemplating
anything
but
bartie
is
very
easy
to
live
with
is
he
no
he
not
he
never
was
all
the
same
bartie
was
impossible
between
the
diseases
he
had
and
thought
he
and
the
diseases
he
had
and
thought
he
had
he
made
life
miserable
for
himself
and
other
people
he
was
a
jealous
egoist
he
had
the
morbid
coldness
of
the
neurotic
and
vera
was
passionate
she
ought
never
to
have
married
him
all
the
same
all
the
same
i
shall
stick
to
bartie
as
long
as
it
possible
and
as
long
as
it
possible
bartie
stick
to
me
but
if
anything
happens
i
want
you
to
promise
that
you
take
ronny
you
must
get
frances
to
promise
she
do
anything
you
ask
her
to
anthony
when
frances
came
into
the
room
again
vera
was
crying
and
so
frances
promised
bridge
is
broken
down
over
my
lady
it
up
with
stones
so
strong
it
up
with
gold
so
fine
it
was
twenty
to
eight
and
ronny
had
not
so
much
as
begun
to
say
good
night
she
was
singing
her
sons
to
spin
out
the
time
bridge
that
do
ronny
it
time
you
were
in
bed
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
linger
and
draw
out
her
caresses
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
going
to
bed
alone
frances
at
vera
request
had
had
her
cot
moved
up
into
the
night
nursery
viii
anthony
had
begun
to
wonder
where
on
earth
he
should
send
morrie
out
to
this
time
when
the
boer
war
came
and
solved
his
problem
maurice
joyous
and
adventurous
again
sent
himself
to
south
africa
to
enlist
in
the
imperial
light
horse
ferdie
cameron
went
out
also
with
the
second
gordon
highlanders
solving
perhaps
another
problem
it
no
use
trying
to
be
sorry
mummy
dorothy
said
frances
knew
what
anthony
was
thinking
and
anthony
knew
it
was
what
frances
thought
herself
supposing
this
time
morrie
did
come
back
then
that
problem
would
be
solved
for
ever
frances
hated
problems
when
they
worried
anthony
anthony
detested
problems
when
they
bothered
frances
and
the
children
knew
what
they
were
thinking
dorothy
went
on
it
all
rot
pretending
that
we
want
him
to
come
back
it
was
jolly
decent
of
him
to
enlist
said
nicky
dorothy
admitted
that
it
was
jolly
decent
but
she
said
what
else
could
he
do
his
only
chance
was
to
go
away
and
do
something
so
jolly
plucky
that
ashamed
of
ourselves
and
never
to
come
back
again
to
spoil
it
you
do
want
him
to
spoil
it
mummy
ducky
do
you
anthony
and
frances
tried
conscientiously
and
patriotically
to
realize
the
boer
war
they
said
it
was
terrible
to
have
it
hanging
over
them
morning
noon
and
night
but
it
did
really
hang
over
them
it
hung
over
a
country
that
except
once
when
it
had
conveniently
swallowed
up
morrie
they
had
never
thought
about
and
could
not
care
for
a
landscape
that
they
could
not
see
the
war
was
not
even
part
of
that
landscape
it
refused
to
move
over
it
in
any
traceable
course
it
simply
hung
or
lay
as
one
photographic
film
might
lie
upon
another
it
was
not
their
fault
they
tried
to
see
it
they
bought
the
special
editions
of
the
evening
papers
they
read
the
military
dispatches
and
the
stories
of
the
war
correspondents
from
beginning
to
end
they
stared
blankly
at
the
printed
columns
that
recorded
the
disasters
of
nicholson
nek
and
colenso
and
spion
kop
but
the
forms
were
grey
and
insubstantial
it
was
all
fiat
and
grey
like
the
pictures
in
the
illustrated
papers
the
very
blood
of
it
ran
grey
it
was
real
for
frances
the
brown
walls
of
the
house
the
open
wings
of
its
white
shutters
the
green
garden
and
tree
of
heaven
were
real
so
were
jack
straw
castle
and
harrow
on
the
hill
morning
and
noon
and
night
were
real
and
getting
up
and
dressing
and
going
to
bed
most
real
of
all
the
sight
and
sound
and
touch
of
her
husband
and
her
children
only
now
and
then
the
vision
grew
solid
and
stood
firm
frances
carried
about
with
her
distinct
images
of
maurice
to
which
she
could
attach
the
rest
thus
she
had
an
image
of
long
tom
an
immense
slender
muzzle
tilted
up
over
a
high
ridge
nosing
out
maurice
maurice
was
shut
up
in
ladysmith
do
worry
mummy
that
keep
him
out
of
mischief
daddy
said
he
ought
to
be
shut
up
somewhere
he
starving
dorothy
he
wo
have
anything
to
eat
or
drink
ducky
oh
you
cruel
do
be
cruel
i
not
cruel
if
i
did
care
so
awfully
for
you
mummy
i
mind
whether
he
came
back
or
did
cruel
you
ought
to
think
of
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmy
and
auntie
edie
at
the
moment
said
frances
i
am
thinking
of
uncle
morrie
she
was
thinking
of
him
not
as
he
actually
was
but
as
he
had
been
as
a
big
boy
like
michael
as
a
little
boy
like
john
two
years
younger
than
she
a
little
boy
by
turns
spoiled
and
thwarted
who
contrived
nevertheless
to
get
most
things
that
he
happened
to
want
by
crying
for
them
though
everybody
else
went
without
and
in
the
place
under
the
shells
of
ladysmith
she
saw
nicky
for
nicky
had
declared
his
intention
of
going
into
the
army
and
i
thinking
of
morrie
dorothy
said
i
do
want
him
to
miss
it
frances
and
anthony
had
hung
out
flags
for
mafeking
dorothy
and
nicky
mounted
on
bicycles
had
been
careering
through
the
high
street
with
flags
flying
from
their
handlebars
michael
was
a
and
flew
no
flags
all
these
things
irritated
maurice
he
had
come
back
again
he
had
missed
it
as
he
had
missed
all
the
chances
that
were
ever
given
him
a
slight
wound
kept
him
in
hospital
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
siege
and
he
had
missed
the
sortie
of
his
squadron
and
the
taking
of
the
guns
for
which
ferdie
cameron
got
his
promotion
and
his
he
had
come
back
in
the
middle
of
the
war
with
nothing
but
a
bullet
wound
in
his
left
leg
to
prove
that
he
had
taken
part
in
it
the
part
he
had
taken
had
not
sobered
maurice
it
had
only
depressed
him
and
depression
after
prolonged
brutal
abstinence
broke
down
the
sheer
strength
by
which
sometimes
he
stretched
a
period
of
sobriety
beyond
its
natural
limits
for
there
were
two
kinds
of
drinking
great
drinking
that
came
seldom
and
was
the
only
thing
that
counted
and
ordinary
drinking
that
though
it
went
on
most
of
the
time
brought
no
satisfaction
and
did
count
at
all
and
there
were
two
states
of
drunkenness
to
correspond
one
intense
and
vivid
without
memory
transcending
all
other
states
and
one
that
was
no
more
remarkable
than
any
other
before
the
war
morrie
great
drinking
came
seldom
by
fits
and
bursts
and
splendid
unlasting
uprushes
after
the
war
the
two
states
tended
to
approach
till
they
merged
in
one
continual
sickly
soaking
and
while
other
important
and
outstanding
things
and
things
that
he
really
wanted
to
remember
disappeared
in
the
poisonous
flood
let
loose
in
morrie
memory
he
never
for
one
moment
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
was
he
and
not
anthony
his
who
had
enlisted
and
was
wounded
he
was
furious
with
his
mother
and
sisters
for
not
realizing
the
war
he
was
furious
with
frances
and
anthony
not
realizing
the
war
meant
not
realizing
what
he
had
been
through
he
swore
by
some
queer
god
of
his
that
he
would
make
them
realize
it
the
least
they
could
do
for
him
was
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
you
people
here
do
know
what
war
is
you
think
it
all
glory
and
pluck
and
dashing
out
and
blowing
up
the
enemy
guns
and
the
british
flag
flying
and
wounded
pipers
piping
all
the
time
and
not
caring
a
damn
nobody
caring
a
damn
and
it
is
it
dirt
and
funk
and
stinks
and
more
funk
all
the
time
it
lying
out
all
night
on
the
beastly
veldt
and
going
to
sleep
and
getting
frozen
and
waking
up
and
finding
you
got
warm
again
because
your
neighbour
inside
been
fired
out
on
the
top
of
you
you
get
wounded
when
the
are
anywhere
about
and
you
crawl
over
to
the
next
poor
devil
and
lie
back
to
back
with
him
to
keep
warm
and
just
when
you
dropped
off
to
sleep
you
wake
up
shivering
because
he
died
of
a
wound
he
did
know
he
got
you
find
a
chap
lying
on
his
back
all
nice
and
comfy
and
when
you
start
to
pick
him
up
you
ca
lift
him
because
his
head
glued
to
the
ground
you
try
a
bit
gently
and
the
flesh
gives
way
like
rotten
fruit
and
the
bone
like
a
cup
you
broken
and
stuck
together
without
any
seccotine
and
you
heave
up
a
body
with
half
a
head
on
it
and
all
the
brains
are
in
the
other
half
the
one
that
glued
down
that
war
huh
he
threw
out
his
breath
with
a
jerk
of
contempt
it
seemed
to
him
that
neither
frances
nor
anthony
was
listening
to
him
they
were
not
looking
at
him
they
did
want
to
listen
they
did
want
to
look
at
him
he
could
touch
them
he
could
evoke
one
single
clear
image
in
their
minds
there
was
no
horror
he
could
name
that
would
sting
them
to
vision
to
realization
they
had
not
been
there
dorothy
and
michael
and
nicky
were
listening
the
three
kids
had
imagination
they
could
take
it
in
they
stared
as
if
he
had
brought
those
horrors
into
the
room
but
even
they
missed
the
reality
of
it
they
saw
everything
he
meant
them
to
see
except
him
it
was
as
if
they
were
in
the
conspiracy
to
keep
him
out
of
it
he
glared
at
frances
and
anthony
what
was
the
good
of
telling
them
of
trying
to
make
them
realize
it
if
they
only
given
some
sign
made
some
noise
or
some
gesture
or
looked
at
him
he
might
have
spared
them
but
the
stiff
averted
faces
of
frances
and
anthony
annoyed
him
and
if
you
a
poor
wretched
tommy
like
me
you
have
to
sweat
in
a
brutal
sun
hauling
up
cases
of
fizz
from
the
railway
up
country
to
headquarters
with
a
thirst
on
you
that
frizzles
your
throat
you
see
the
stuff
shining
and
spluttering
and
you
go
mad
you
could
kill
the
man
if
you
were
to
see
him
drink
it
when
you
know
there
nothing
for
but
a
bucket
of
green
water
with
typhoid
germs
swimming
about
in
it
that
war
you
think
you
lucky
if
you
wounded
and
get
bumped
down
in
a
bullock
wagon
thirty
miles
to
the
base
hospital
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
then
is
to
pop
off
for
if
you
get
better
they
make
you
hospital
orderly
and
the
hospital
orderly
has
to
clean
up
all
the
muck
of
the
butcher
shop
from
morning
to
night
when
you
so
sick
you
stand
you
get
your
supper
dry
bread
and
bully
beef
the
bully
beef
reminds
you
of
things
and
the
bread
well
the
bread
all
nice
and
white
on
the
top
but
when
you
turn
it
over
on
the
other
side
it
red
that
war
frances
looked
at
him
he
thought
at
last
she
turned
at
last
touched
her
she
can
realize
that
morrie
dear
it
must
have
been
awful
she
said
it
awful
i
do
mind
your
telling
me
and
anthony
about
it
but
i
rather
you
did
it
when
the
children
are
in
the
room
is
that
all
you
think
about
the
children
the
children
you
do
care
a
tinker
cuss
about
the
war
you
do
care
a
damn
what
happens
to
me
or
anybody
else
what
does
it
matter
who
wounded
or
who
killed
as
long
as
it
is
one
of
your
own
kids
i
simply
trying
to
tell
you
what
war
it
dirt
and
stink
and
funk
that
all
it
is
and
there
precious
little
glory
in
it
nicky
if
the
boers
won
there
would
be
glory
michael
said
not
even
if
the
boers
won
said
maurice
certainly
not
if
the
boers
won
said
anthony
you
say
next
there
be
no
glory
if
there
was
war
between
england
and
ireland
and
the
irish
won
and
yet
there
would
be
glory
would
there
go
and
read
history
and
do
talk
rot
i
have
read
it
said
michael
frances
thought
he
does
know
what
he
talking
about
why
should
he
he
barely
thirteen
i
ca
think
where
he
gets
these
ideas
from
but
he
grow
out
of
them
it
was
not
maurice
that
she
saw
in
maurice
but
he
had
made
them
realize
what
war
was
and
they
vowed
that
as
long
as
they
lived
not
one
of
their
sons
should
have
anything
to
do
with
it
in
the
spring
of
anthony
sent
maurice
out
to
california
the
boer
war
was
ended
another
year
and
the
vision
of
war
passed
from
frances
as
if
it
had
never
been
ix
michael
was
unhappy
the
almond
trees
flowered
in
front
of
the
white
houses
in
the
strange
white
streets
white
squares
white
terraces
white
crescents
at
the
turn
of
the
roads
the
startling
beauty
of
the
trees
covered
with
pink
blossoms
hot
against
the
hot
white
walls
after
the
pink
blossoms
green
leaves
and
a
strange
white
heat
everywhere
you
went
from
pavements
burning
white
down
long
avenues
under
the
shadows
of
the
limes
a
great
promenade
going
down
like
a
long
green
tunnel
from
the
big
white
hotel
at
the
top
to
the
high
street
at
the
bottom
of
the
basin
where
the
very
dregs
of
the
heat
sank
and
thickened
promenade
forbidden
for
no
earthly
reason
that
michael
could
see
except
that
it
was
beautiful
hotel
where
his
father
gave
him
dinner
on
his
last
day
of
blessed
life
telling
him
to
choose
what
he
liked
best
as
the
condemned
criminal
chooses
his
last
meal
on
the
day
they
hang
him
cleeve
hill
and
battledown
and
birdlip
and
the
long
rampart
of
leckhampton
a
thin
curling
bristle
of
small
trees
on
the
edge
of
it
forms
that
made
an
everlasting
pattern
on
his
mind
forms
that
haunted
him
at
night
and
tempted
and
tormented
him
all
day
memory
which
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
not
had
of
the
raking
open
country
over
the
top
of
broad
white
light
and
luminous
blue
shadows
of
white
roads
switchbacking
through
the
sheep
pastures
fields
of
bright
yellow
mustard
in
flower
on
the
lower
hills
then
rectangular
fir
plantations
and
copses
of
slender
beech
trees
in
the
hollows
somewhere
the
severn
faint
and
still
like
a
river
in
a
dream
memory
of
the
round
white
town
in
the
round
pit
of
the
valley
shining
smoking
through
the
thick
air
and
the
white
orchard
blossoms
memory
saturated
by
a
smell
that
is
like
no
other
smell
on
earth
the
delicate
smell
of
the
midland
limestone
country
the
smell
of
clean
white
dust
and
of
grass
drying
in
the
sun
and
of
mustard
flowers
michael
was
in
cheltenham
it
was
a
matter
of
many
unhappinesses
not
one
unhappiness
a
sudden
intolerable
unhappiness
the
flash
and
stab
of
the
beauty
of
the
seen
in
passing
and
never
seized
beauty
which
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
he
had
not
seen
the
knowledge
which
he
ought
never
to
have
had
that
this
beauty
had
to
die
was
killed
because
he
had
not
seized
it
when
if
he
could
but
have
held
it
for
one
minute
it
would
have
been
immortal
a
vague
light
unhappiness
that
came
sometimes
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
think
why
from
the
sight
of
his
own
body
stripped
and
from
the
feeling
of
his
own
muscles
there
was
sadness
for
him
in
his
very
strength
a
long
aching
unhappiness
that
came
with
his
memory
of
the
open
country
over
the
tops
of
the
hills
which
in
their
incredible
stupidity
and
cruelty
they
had
let
him
see
a
quick
lacerating
unhappiness
when
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
of
the
garden
on
the
heath
and
the
high
ridge
of
the
road
and
london
below
it
immense
and
beautiful
the
unhappiness
of
never
being
by
himself
he
was
afraid
of
the
herd
it
was
with
him
night
and
day
he
was
afraid
of
the
thoughts
the
emotions
that
seized
it
swaying
moving
the
multitude
of
undeveloped
souls
as
if
they
had
been
one
monstrous
dominating
soul
he
was
afraid
of
their
voices
when
they
chanted
sang
and
shouted
together
he
loathed
their
slang
even
when
he
used
it
he
disliked
the
collective
male
odour
of
the
herd
the
brushing
against
him
of
bodies
inflamed
with
running
the
steam
of
their
speed
rising
through
their
hot
sweaters
and
the
smell
of
dust
and
ink
and
and
resinous
wood
in
the
warm
michael
was
at
school
the
thing
he
had
dreaded
that
had
hung
over
him
threatening
him
for
years
before
it
happened
had
happened
nothing
could
have
prevented
it
their
names
had
been
down
for
cheltenham
long
ago
first
his
then
nicky
cheltenham
because
bartie
and
vera
lived
there
and
because
it
had
a
college
for
girls
and
dorothy
who
wanted
to
go
to
roedean
had
been
sent
to
cheltenham
because
of
bartie
and
vera
and
for
no
other
reason
first
dorothy
then
he
michael
then
the
next
term
nicky
and
nicky
had
been
sent
a
whole
year
before
his
time
because
of
michael
in
the
hope
that
michael
would
settle
down
better
if
he
had
his
brother
with
him
it
did
seem
reasonable
not
that
either
dorothy
or
nicky
minded
when
they
got
there
all
that
nicky
minded
was
not
being
at
hampstead
being
at
cheltenham
he
did
not
mind
at
all
he
rather
liked
it
since
major
cameron
had
come
to
stay
just
outside
it
on
purpose
to
annoy
bartie
and
took
them
out
riding
even
michael
did
not
mind
cheltenham
more
than
any
other
place
his
people
might
have
chosen
he
was
not
unreasonable
all
he
asked
was
to
be
let
alone
and
to
have
room
to
breathe
and
get
ahead
in
as
it
was
he
had
either
to
go
with
the
school
mass
or
waste
energy
in
resisting
its
poisonous
impact
he
had
chosen
resistance
tudor

cheltenham
dearest
mother
i
put
sunday
on
this
letter
though
it
really
friday
because
supposed
to
be
writing
it
on
sunday
when
the
other
fellows
are
writing
that
the
beastly
thing
about
this
place
you
expected
to
do
everything
when
the
other
fellows
are
doing
it
whether
you
want
to
or
not
as
if
the
very
fact
that
they
doing
it
too
did
make
you
hate
it
i
writing
now
because
i
simply
must
if
i
waited
till
sunday
i
might
want
to
and
anyhow
i
should
remember
a
single
thing
i
meant
to
say
even
now
johnson
minor
digging
his
skinny
elbows
into
one
side
of
me
and
hartley
major
biting
the
feathers
off
his
pen
and
spitting
them
out
again
on
the
other
but
they
only
supposed
to
be
doing
latin
verse
so
it
does
matter
so
much
what
i
mean
is
it
as
if
their
beastly
minds
kept
on
leaking
into
yours
till
you
all
mixed
up
with
them
that
why
i
asked
daddy
to
take
me
away
next
term
you
see
more
serious
than
he
thinks
it
is
really
you
no
idea
what
like
you
got
to
swot
every
blessed
thing
the
other
fellows
swot
even
if
you
ca
do
it
and
whether
it
going
to
be
any
good
to
you
or
not
why
you
expected
to
sleep
when
they
sleeping
even
if
the
chap
next
you
snores
daddy
remember
that
it
nicky
who
likes
mathematics
not
me
it
all
very
well
for
nicky
when
he
wants
to
go
into
the
army
all
the
time
there
are
things
want
to
do
i
want
to
write
and
i
going
to
write
daddy
ca
keep
me
off
it
and
i
believe
he
want
to
if
he
understood
there
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
ever
be
any
good
at
and
there
are
things
i
want
to
know
i
want
to
know
greek
and
latin
and
french
and
german
and
italian
and
spanish
and
old
french
and
russian
and
chinese
and
japanese
oh
and
provençal
and
every
blessed
language
that
has
or
has
had
a
literature
i
can
learn
languages
quite
fast
do
you
suppose
i
got
a
chance
of
knowing
one
of
them
really
knowing
even
if
i
had
the
time
not
much
and
that
where
being
so
rotten
they
waste
your
time
as
if
it
was
theirs
not
yours
simply
no
notion
of
the
value
of
it
they
seem
to
think
time
matter
because
you
young
fancy
taking
three
months
over
a
greek
play
you
can
read
in
three
hours
that
give
you
some
idea
it
all
comes
of
being
in
a
beastly
form
and
having
to
go
with
the
other
fellows
say
they
thirty
fellows
in
your
form
and
stick
you
got
to
stick
with
them
if
it
terms
and
terms
they
ca
do
it
any
other
way
it
i
young
mummy
that
i
mind
so
awfully
supposing
i
died
in
ten
years
time
or
even
fifteen
it
simply
makes
me
hate
everybody
love
to
daddy
and
don
your
loving
mick
do
mean
that
hartley
major
is
good
at
latin
verse
he
is
he
can
lick
me
into
fits
when
he
bitten
the
feathers
off
tudor
house
cheltenham
darling
mummy
daddy
understand
you
only
think
he
does
because
you
like
him
it
all
rot
what
he
says
about
esprit
de
corps
the
putridest
rot
though
i
know
he
does
mean
it
and
he
wrong
about
gym
and
drill
and
games
and
all
that
i
do
mind
gym
and
i
do
mind
drill
and
i
like
games
i
fairly
good
at
most
of
them
except
footer
all
the
fellows
say
i
fairly
good
otherwise
i
do
suppose
they
stick
me
for
a
minute
i
do
even
mind
chapel
you
see
when
it
only
your
body
doing
what
the
other
chaps
do
it
does
seem
to
matter
if
esprit
de
corps
esprit
de
corps
it
would
be
all
right
but
it
esprit
and
it
absolutely
sickening
the
things
they
can
do
to
your
mind
i
ca
stand
another
term
of
it
always
your
loving
mick
do
you
know
i
sha
be
dead
in
ten
or
fifteen
years
time
it
enough
to
make
me
all
very
well
for
daddy
to
talk
does
want
to
learn
chinese
tudor
house
cheltenham
dear
father
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
only
i
shall
kill
myself
you
tell
mother
that
though
it
wo
matter
so
much
as
she
very
likely
think
and
perhaps
then
you
wo
try
and
stop
nicky
going
into
the
army
as
you
stopped
me
i
do
care
a
ram
as
nicky
would
say
whether
you
bury
me
or
cremate
me
only
you
might
give
my
theocritus
to
old
parsons
and
my
revolver
to
nicky
if
it

your
turn

a
letter

you
think
daddy
let
me
turn
the
into
a
workshop
next
holidays

any
hens
and
would
he
give
me
a
proper
lathe
for
turning
steel
and
brass
and
stuff
for
my
next
birthday
i
afraid
it
cost
an
awful
lot
but
he
could
take
it
out
of
my
other
birthdays
i
do
mind
how
many
so
long
as
i
can
have
the
lathe
this
one
this
place
is
half
bad
once
you
get
used
to
it
i
like
the
fellows
and
all
the
masters
are
really
jolly
decent
though
i
wish
we
had
old
parsons
here
instead
of
the
one
we
have
to
do
greek
for
he
an
awful
chap
to
make
you
swot
i
do
know
what
you
mean
about
mick
being
seedy
he
as
fit
as
fit
you
should
see
him
when
he
stripped
but
he
hates
the
place
like
poison
half
the
time
he
ca
stand
being
with
a
lot
of
fellows
he
a
rum
chap
because
they
all
like
him
no
end
the
masters
and
the
fellows
though
they
think
he
funny
all
except
hartley
major
but
he
such
a
measly
little
blighter
that
he
does
count
we
had
a
ripping
time
last
saturday
bartie
went
up
to
town
and
major
cameron
took
dorothy
and
ronny
and
vera
and
me
and
mick
to
birdlip
in
his
only
mick
and
me
had
to
bike
because
there
was
room
enough
however
we
grabbed
the
chains
behind
and
the
pulled
us
up
the
hills
like
anything
and
we
could
talk
to
dorothy
and
ronny
without
having
to
yell
at
each
other
he
did
us
jolly
well
at
tea
afterwards
dorothy
rode
my
bike
stridelegs
coming
back
so
that
i
could
sit
in
the
she
said
she
get
a
jolly
wigging
if
she
was
seen
we
know
till
monday
you
know
mummy
that
kid
ronny
having
a
rotten
time
what
with
bartie
being
such
a
beast
and
vera
chumming
up
with
ferdie
and
going
off
to
country
houses
where
he
is
i
really
think
she
better
come
to
us
for
the
holidays
then
i
could
teach
her
to
ride
bartie
wo
let
her
learn
here
though
ferdie
gone
and
bought
a
pony
for
her
that
was
to
spite
ferdie
he
worse
than
ever
if
you
can
imagine
that
and
he
got
three
more
things
the
matter
with
him
i
must
stop
now
love
to
dad
and
don
and
nanna
next
year
i
to
go
into
physics
and
stinks
that
chemistry
your
loving
nicky
the
leas
parabola
road
cheltenham
dearest
mummy
i
awfully
sorry
you
do
like
my
last
term
school
report
i
know
it
was
what
it
ought
to
have
been
i
have
to
hold
myself
in
so
as
to
keep
in
the
same
class
with
rosalind
when
we
moved
up
after
midsummer
but
as
she
promised
me
faithfully
she
let
herself
rip
next
term
you
see
it
be
all
right
at
xmas
we
both
be
in
i
a
the
midsummer
after
and
we
can
go
in
for
our
matic
together
i
wish
you
arrange
with
jervis
for
both
of
us
to
be
at
newnham
at
the
same
time
tell
her
rosalind
an
awful
slacker
if
i
not
there
to
keep
her
up
to
the
mark
no
do
tell
her
that
tell
her
a
slacker
if
she
is
there
i
was
amused
by
your
saying
it
was
decent
of
bartie
to
have
us
so
often
he
only
does
it
because
things
are
getting
so
tight
between
him
and
vera
that
he
glad
of
anything
that
relaxes
the
strain
a
bit
even
us
he
snappier
than
ever
with
ronny
i
ca
think
how
the
poor
kid
stands
it
you
know
that
ripping
white
serge
coat
and
skirt
you
sent
me
well
the
skirt
not
nearly
long
enough
it
does
matter
a
bit
though
because
i
can
keep
it
for
hockey
it
nice
having
a
mother
who
choose
clothes
you
should
see
the
last
blouse
jervis
got
for
rosalind
she
burst
out
of
the
seams
already
you
could
have
heard
her
doing
it
much
love
to
you
and
daddy
and
i
ca
send
any
to
parsons
now
my
hair
up
but
you
might
tell
him
i
going
in
strong
for
sociology
and
your
loving
dorothy
vera
asked
me
if
i
thought
you
take
her
and
ronny
in
at
midsummer
i
said
of
course
you
would
like
a
shot
lansdown
lodge
cheltenham
my
dearest
frances
i
hope
you
got
my
two
wires
in
time
you
need
come
down
either
of
you
and
you
need
worry
about
mick
ferdie
went
round
and
talked
to
him
like
a
fa
i
mean
a
big
brother
and
the
revolver
bless
his
heart
is
at
present
reposing
at
the
bottom
of
my
all
the
same
we
both
think
you
better
take
him
away
at
midsummer
he
says
he
can
stick
it
till
then
but
not
a
day
longer
poor
mick
he
has
the
most
mysterious
troubles
i
daresay
it
the
cheltenham
climate
as
much
as
anything
it
suit
me
or
bonny
either
and
it
simply
killing
ferdie
by
inches
i
suppose
that
why
bartie
makes
us
stay
here
in
the
hope
oh
my
dear
i
worried
out
of
my
life
about
him
he
never
got
over
that
fever
he
had
in
south
africa
he
looking
ghastly
and
the
awful
thing
is
that
i
ca
do
a
thing
for
him
not
a
thing
unless
you
have
forgotten
the
promise
you
made
me
two
years
ago
have
you
dorothy
seemed
to
think
you
could
put
bonny
and
me
up
again
at
midsummer
can
you
and
if
poor
ferdie
wants
to
come
and
see
us
you
wo
turn
him
off
your
will
you
your
lovingest
vera
frances
said
poor
vera
she
even
makes
poor
mick
an
excuse
for
seeing
ferdie
x
three
more
years
passed
and
frances
had
fulfilled
her
promise
she
had
taken
veronica
the
situation
had
become
definite
bartie
had
delivered
his
ultimatum
either
vera
must
give
up
major
cameron
signing
a
written
pledge
in
the
presence
of
three
witnesses
frances
anthony
and
bartie
solicitor
that
she
would
neither
see
him
nor
write
to
him
nor
hold
any
sort
or
manner
of
communication
with
him
direct
or
indirect
or
he
would
obtain
a
judicial
separation
it
was
to
be
clearly
understood
by
both
of
them
that
he
would
not
in
any
circumstances
divorce
her
bartie
knew
that
a
divorce
was
what
they
wanted
what
they
had
been
playing
for
and
he
was
not
going
to
make
things
easy
for
them
he
was
going
to
make
things
hard
and
bitter
and
shameful
he
had
based
his
ultimatum
on
the
calculation
that
vera
would
not
have
the
courage
of
her
emotions
that
even
her
passion
would
surrender
when
she
found
that
it
had
no
longer
the
protection
of
her
husband
house
and
name
besides
vera
was
expensive
and
cameron
was
a
spendthrift
on
an
insufficient
income
he
could
not
possibly
afford
her
if
bartie
suspicions
were
correct
the
thing
had
been
going
on
for
the
last
twelve
years
and
if
in
twelve
years
time
they
had
not
forced
his
hand
that
was
because
they
had
counted
the
cost
and
decided
that
as
frances
had
put
it
the
game
was
not
worth
the
scandal
for
when
suspicion
became
unendurable
he
had
consulted
anthony
who
assured
him
that
frances
who
ought
to
know
was
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
except
incompatibility
for
which
bartie
was
superlatively
responsible
anthony
manner
did
not
encourage
confidence
and
he
gathered
that
his
own
more
sinister
interpretation
would
be
dismissed
with
contemptuous
incredulity
anthony
was
under
his
wife
thumb
and
frances
had
been
completely
bamboozled
by
her
dearest
friend
still
when
once
their
eyes
were
opened
he
reckoned
on
the
support
of
anthony
and
frances
it
was
inconceivable
that
faced
with
a
public
scandal
his
brother
and
his
would
side
with
vera
it
was
a
game
where
bartie
apparently
held
all
the
cards
and
his
trump
card
was
veronica
he
was
not
going
to
keep
veronica
without
vera
that
had
been
tacitly
understood
between
them
long
ago
if
vera
went
to
cameron
she
could
not
take
veronica
with
her
without
openly
confirming
bartie
worst
suspicion
and
yet
all
these
things
so
inconceivable
to
bartie
happened
when
it
came
to
the
stabbing
point
the
courage
of
vera
emotions
was
such
that
she
defied
her
husband
and
his
ultimatum
and
went
to
cameron
by
that
time
ferdie
was
so
ill
that
she
would
have
been
ashamed
of
herself
if
she
had
not
gone
and
though
anthony
house
was
not
open
to
the
unhappy
lovers
frances
and
anthony
had
taken
veronica
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmeline
and
auntie
edie
came
over
to
west
end
house
when
they
heard
that
it
had
been
decided
it
was
time
they
said
that
somebody
should
protest
that
somebody
should
advise
frances
for
her
own
good
and
for
the
good
of
her
children
they
had
always
detested
and
distrusted
vera
harrison
they
had
always
known
what
would
happen
the
wonder
was
it
had
not
happened
before
but
why
frances
should
make
it
easy
for
her
why
frances
should
shoulder
vera
harrison
responsibilities
and
burden
herself
with
that
child
and
why
anthony
should
give
his
consent
to
such
a
proceeding
was
more
than
they
could
imagine
once
frances
had
stood
up
for
the
three
aunties
against
grannie
now
grannie
and
the
three
aunties
were
united
against
frances
frances
you
a
foolish
woman
my
folly
is
my
own
affair
and
anthony
you
have
to
pay
for
it
some
day
you
might
have
thought
of
your
own
children
first
i
did
i
thought
how
would
i
like
to
be
forsaken
like
poor
ronny
you
should
have
thought
of
the
boys
michael
growing
up
so
is
nicky
nicky
is
fifteen
ronny
is
eleven
if
you
call
that
growing
up
that
all
very
well
but
when
nicky
is
and
ronny
is
seventeen
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
not
going
to
turn
ronny
out
of
doors
for
fear
nicky
should
fall
in
love
with
her
if
that
what
you
mean
it
what
i
mean
now
you
mentioned
it
he
less
likely
to
fall
in
love
with
her
if
i
bring
them
up
as
brother
and
sister
you
might
think
of
anthony
bartholomew
wife
leaves
him
for
another
man
and
you
aid
and
abet
her
by
taking
her
child
relieving
her
of
her
one
responsibility
bartie
wife
leaves
him
and
we
help
bartie
by
taking
care
of
his
child
who
is
not
yours
my
dear
frances
that
attitude
is
going
to
deceive
anybody
if
you
do
think
of
anthony
and
your
children
you
might
think
of
us
we
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
perfectly
horrible
affair
how
are
you
mixed
up
in
it
well
after
all
frances
we
are
the
family
we
are
your
sisters
and
your
mother
and
your
children
and
aunts
then
said
frances
with
decision
you
must
try
to
bear
it
you
must
take
the
rough
with
the
smooth
as
anthony
and
i
do
and
as
soon
as
she
had
said
it
she
was
sorry
it
struck
her
for
the
first
time
that
her
sisters
were
getting
old
it
was
no
use
for
auntie
louie
more
red
and
more
rigid
than
ever
to
defy
the
imminence
of
her
birthday
auntie
emmy
gestures
her
mouthings
and
excitement
only
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
was
and
edie
why
even
poor
little
auntie
edie
was
grannie
dry
and
wiry
hardly
looked
older
than
auntie
edie
they
left
her
going
stiffly
in
offence
and
again
the
unbearable
pathos
of
them
smote
her
the
poor
aunties
she
was
a
brute
to
hurt
them
she
still
thought
of
them
as
auntie
louie
auntie
emmy
auntie
edie
it
seemed
kinder
for
thus
she
bestowed
upon
them
a
colour
and
vitality
that
but
for
her
and
for
her
children
they
would
not
have
had
they
were
helpless
tiresome
utterly
inefficient
in
all
their
lives
they
had
never
done
anything
vigorous
or
memorable
they
were
doomed
to
go
out
before
her
children
when
they
were
gone
they
would
be
gone
altogether
neither
auntie
louie
nor
auntie
emmy
nor
auntie
edie
would
leave
any
mark
or
sign
of
herself
but
her
children
gave
them
titles
by
which
they
would
be
remembered
after
they
were
gone
it
was
as
if
she
had
bestowed
on
them
a
little
of
her
own
enduring
life
it
was
absurd
and
pathetic
that
they
should
think
that
they
were
the
family
but
however
sorry
she
was
for
them
she
could
not
allow
them
to
dictate
to
her
in
matters
that
concerned
her
and
anthony
alone
if
they
were
so
worried
about
the
scandal
why
had
they
the
sense
to
see
that
the
only
way
to
meet
it
was
to
give
it
the
lie
by
taking
ronny
by
behaving
as
if
ronny
were
unquestionably
bartie
daughter
and
their
niece
they
were
bound
to
do
it
if
not
for
vera
sake
for
the
dear
little
sake
and
that
was
what
vera
had
been
thinking
of
that
was
why
she
had
trusted
them
but
her
three
sisters
had
always
disliked
vera
they
disliked
her
because
while
they
went
unmarried
vera
not
content
with
the
one
man
who
was
her
just
and
legal
portion
had
taken
another
man
whom
she
had
no
right
to
and
auntie
emmeline
had
been
in
love
with
ferdie
still
there
was
a
certain
dreadful
truth
in
their
reproaches
and
it
stung
frances
said
to
herselv
that
she
had
not
been
wise
she
had
done
a
risky
thing
in
taking
ronny
it
was
not
fair
to
her
children
to
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
she
was
afraid
she
had
been
afraid
when
vera
had
talked
to
her
about
nicky
and
veronica
and
when
she
had
seen
veronica
and
nicky
playing
together
in
the
house
and
when
she
had
heard
ronny
voice
outside
the
schoolroom
door
crying
nicky
i
want
him
will
he
be
very
long
supposing
veronica
should
go
on
wanting
nicky
and
supposing
nicky
frances
was
so
worried
that
when
dorothy
came
striding
across
the
lawn
to
ask
her
what
the
matter
was
and
what
on
earth
grannie
and
the
aunties
had
been
gassing
about
all
that
time
she
told
her
dorothy
was
nineteen
and
dorothy
at
nineteen
tall
and
upright
was
anthony
daughter
her
face
and
her
whole
body
had
changed
they
were
anthony
face
and
body
made
feminine
her
little
straight
nose
had
now
a
short
high
bridge
her
brown
eyes
were
keen
and
alert
she
had
his
hawk
look
she
put
her
arm
in
frances
protecting
her
and
they
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
path
discussing
it
in
the
distance
grannie
and
the
aunties
could
be
seen
climbing
the
slope
of
the
heath
to
judges
walk
they
were
not
dorothy
protested
pathetic
they
were
simply
beastly
she
hated
them
for
worrying
her
mother
they
think
i
ought
to
have
taken
ronny
they
think
nicky
want
to
marry
her
but
ronny
a
kid
when
she
not
a
kid
he
wo
mummy
ducky
he
wo
she
be
a
kid
for
ages
have
married
somebody
else
before
she
got
her
hair
up
then
ronny
fall
in
love
with
and
get
her
little
heart
broken
she
wo
mummy
she
wo
they
only
talk
like
that
because
they
think
ferdie
ronny
father
dorothy
frances
in
horror
released
herself
from
that
protecting
arm
the
horror
came
not
from
the
fact
but
from
her
daughter
knowledge
of
it
poor
mummy
did
you
know
that
why
bartie
hates
her
it
is
true
what
the
good
of
that
as
long
as
bartie
thinks
it
is
said
dorothy
london
bridge
is
broken
down
over
my
lady
veronica
was
in
the
singing
london
bridge
michael
in
all
the
beauty
of
his
adolescence
lay
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
watching
her
her
small
exquisite
childish
face
between
the
plaits
of
hair
her
small
childish
face
thrilled
him
with
a
singular
delight
and
sadness
she
was
so
young
and
so
small
and
at
the
same
time
so
perfect
that
michael
could
think
of
her
as
looking
like
that
for
ever
not
growing
up
into
a
tiresome
bouncing
fluffy
flapper
like
rosalind
jervis
aunt
louie
and
aunt
emmeline
said
that
rosalind
was
in
love
with
him
michael
thought
that
was
beastly
of
them
and
he
hoped
it
was
true
it
up
with
gold
so
fine
veronica
was
happy
for
she
knew
herself
to
be
a
cause
of
happiness
like
frances
once
she
was
profoundly
aware
of
her
own
happiness
and
for
the
same
reason
it
was
if
you
came
to
think
of
it
incredible
it
had
been
given
to
her
suddenly
when
she
was
not
looking
for
it
after
she
had
got
used
to
unhappiness
as
long
as
she
could
remember
veronica
had
been
aware
of
herself
aware
of
herself
chiefly
not
as
a
cause
of
happiness
but
as
a
cause
of
embarrassment
and
uncertainty
and
trouble
to
three
people
her
father
her
mother
and
ferdie
just
as
they
were
causes
of
embarrassment
and
trouble
and
uncertainty
to
her
they
lived
in
a
sort
of
violent
mystery
that
she
incomprehensibly
was
mixed
up
with
as
long
as
she
could
remember
her
delicate
childish
soul
had
quivered
with
the
vibration
of
their
incomprehensible
and
tiresome
passions
you
could
never
tell
what
any
of
them
really
wanted
though
among
them
they
managed
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
most
devastating
want
only
one
thing
she
knew
definitely
that
they
did
want
she
was
altogether
out
of
it
except
as
a
meaningless
counter
in
their
incomprehensible
game
her
father
did
want
her
her
mother
did
want
her
very
much
and
though
now
and
then
ferdie
who
any
relation
at
all
behaved
as
if
he
wanted
her
wanting
only
made
the
other
two
want
her
less
than
ever
there
had
been
no
peace
or
quietness
or
security
in
her
little
life
of
eleven
years
their
places
and
they
had
had
so
many
of
them
had
never
had
any
proper
place
for
her
she
seemed
to
have
spent
most
of
her
time
in
being
turned
out
of
one
room
because
her
father
had
come
into
it
and
out
of
another
because
her
mother
wanted
to
be
alone
in
it
with
ferdie
and
nobody
except
ferdie
sometimes
when
they
let
him
ever
wanted
to
be
alone
in
any
room
with
her
she
was
so
tired
of
the
rooms
where
she
was
obliged
to
be
always
alone
with
herself
or
with
the
servants
though
the
servants
were
always
kind
now
in
uncle
anthony
house
there
was
always
peace
and
quietness
and
an
immense
security
she
knew
that
having
taken
her
they
give
her
up
she
was
utterly
happy
and
the
house
with
its
long
wainscoted
rooms
its
whiteness
and
darkness
with
its
gay
clean
shining
chintzes
the
delicate
faded
rose
stuffs
the
deep
blue
and
purple
and
green
stuffs
and
the
blue
and
white
of
the
old
china
and
its
furniture
of
curious
woods
the
golden
the
the
black
and
the
bought
by
anthony
in
many
countries
the
round
concave
mirrors
the
pictures
and
the
old
bronzes
all
the
things
that
he
had
gathered
together
and
laid
up
as
treasure
for
his
sons
and
the
garden
on
the
promontory
with
its
buttressed
walls
and
its
green
lawn
its
flower
borders
and
its
tree
of
heaven
saturated
with
memories
became
for
her
as
they
had
become
for
frances
the
sanctuary
crowded
with
visible
and
tangible
symbols
of
the
happiness
she
adored
sing
it
again
ronny
she
sang
it
again
bridge
is
broken
down
it
was
funny
of
michael
to
like
the
silly
childish
song
but
if
he
wanted
it
he
should
have
it
veronica
would
have
given
any
of
them
anything
they
wanted
there
was
nothing
that
she
had
ever
wanted
that
they
had
not
given
to
her
she
had
wanted
to
be
strong
to
be
able
to
run
and
ride
to
play
tennis
and
cricket
and
hockey
and
nicky
had
shown
her
how
she
had
wanted
books
of
her
own
and
auntie
frances
and
uncle
anthony
and
dorothy
and
michael
had
given
her
books
and
nicky
had
made
her
a
bookcase
her
room
it
was
all
her
own
was
full
of
treasures
she
had
wanted
to
learn
to
sing
and
play
properly
and
uncle
anthony
had
given
her
masters
she
had
wanted
people
to
love
her
music
and
they
loved
it
she
had
wanted
a
big
sister
like
dorothy
and
they
had
given
her
dorothy
and
she
had
wanted
a
little
brother
of
her
own
age
and
they
had
given
her
john
john
had
a
look
of
nicky
his
golden
white
hair
was
light
brown
now
his
fine
wide
mouth
had
nicky
impudence
even
when
like
frances
he
kept
it
shut
to
smile
her
unwilling
twitching
mocking
smile
she
had
wanted
a
father
and
mother
like
frances
and
anthony
and
they
had
given
her
themselves
and
she
had
wanted
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
nicky
always
so
if
michael
wanted
her
to
sing
london
bridge
to
him
twenty
times
over
she
would
sing
it
provided
nicky
did
ask
her
to
do
anything
else
at
the
same
time
for
she
wanted
to
do
most
for
nicky
always
and
yet
she
was
aware
of
something
else
that
was
not
happiness
it
was
not
a
thing
you
could
name
or
understand
or
seize
or
see
you
were
simply
aware
of
it
as
you
were
aware
of
ghosts
in
your
room
at
night
like
the
ghosts
it
was
not
always
there
but
when
it
was
there
you
knew
it
felt
sometimes
as
if
auntie
frances
was
afraid
of
her
as
if
she
veronica
was
a
ghost
and
veronica
said
to
herself
she
is
afraid
i
am
not
good
she
thinks
i
worry
her
but
i
sha
that
was
before
the
holidays
now
that
they
had
come
and
nicky
was
back
it
seemed
to
her
something
to
do
with
nicky
and
veronica
said
to
herself
she
is
afraid
i
get
in
his
way
and
worry
him
because
older
but
i
sha
as
if
she
had
not
been
taught
and
trained
not
to
get
in
older
ways
and
worry
them
and
as
if
she
was
growing
older
every
minute
herself
it
up
with
gold
so
fine
over
my
lady
it
up
with
stones
so
strong
she
had
her
back
to
the
door
and
to
the
mirror
that
reflected
it
yet
she
knew
that
nicky
had
come
in
that
the
song
you
used
to
sing
at
when
you
were
frightened
he
said
she
was
sitting
now
in
the
old
that
was
nicky
workshop
watching
him
as
he
turned
square
bars
of
brass
into
round
bars
with
his
lathe
she
had
plates
of
steel
to
polish
and
pieces
of
wood
to
rub
smooth
with
there
were
sheets
of
brass
and
copper
and
bars
and
lumps
of
steel
and
great
poles
and
planks
of
timber
reared
up
round
the
walls
of
the
workshop
the
metal
filings
fell
from
nicky
lathe
into
sawdust
that
smelt
deliciously
the
workshop
was
nicer
than
the
old
house
because
there
were
always
lots
of
things
to
do
in
it
for
nicky
nicky
she
said
suddenly
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
well
nicky
caught
his
bar
as
it
fell
from
the
lathe
and
examined
it
critically
you
remember
when
i
was
afraid
of
ghosts
and
you
used
to
come
and
sit
with
me
till
i
went
to
sleep
rather
well
there
ghosts
i
saw
one
last
night

into
the
room
just
after
i
got
into
bed

his
family

afraid

the
least
little
bit
i

tell
him
that
he
wanted
most
awfully
to
know
whether
you
saw
them
too
but
nicky
it
was
ferdie
i
saw
he
stood
by
the
door
and
looked
at
me
like
he
does
you
know
the
next
morning
frances
had
a
letter
of
two
lines
from
mother
ferdie

last
evening
at
half
past
eight
he
wants
you
to
keep
ronny
vera
it
was
not
till
years
later
that
veronica
knew
that
he
wanted
most
awfully
to
know
whether
you
saw
them
too
meant
he
wanted
most
awfully
to
know
whether
you
really
were
his
daughter
part
ii
the
vortex
xi
three
years
passed
it
was
the
autumn
of
anthony
house
was
empty
for
the
time
being
of
all
its
children
except
dorothea
michael
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
last
year
at
cambridge
nicholas
was
in
his
second
year
he
had
taken
up
mathematics
and
theoretical
mechanics
in
the
long
vacation
when
the
others
went
into
the
country
he
stayed
behind
to
work
in
the
engineering
sheds
of
the
morss
motor
company
john
was
at
cheltenham
veronica
was
in
dresden
dorothea
had
left
newnham
a
year
ago
having
taken
a
in
economics
as
anthony
came
home
early
one
evening
in
october
he
found
a
group
of
six
strange
women
in
the
lane
waiting
outside
his
garden
door
in
attitudes
of
conspiracy
four
of
them
older
women
stood
together
in
a
close
ring
the
two
others
young
girls
hung
about
near
but
a
little
apart
from
the
ring
as
if
they
desired
not
to
identify
themselves
with
any
state
of
mind
outside
their
own
by
their
low
sibilant
voices
the
daring
sidelong
sortie
of
their
bright
eyes
their
gestures
furtive
and
irrepressible
you
gathered
that
there
was
unanimity
on
one
point
all
six
considered
themselves
to
have
been
discovered
at
anthony
approach
they
moved
away
with
slow
casual
steps
passed
through
the
posts
at
the
bottom
of
the
lane
and
plunged
down
the
steep
path
as
if
under
the
impression
that
the
nature
of
the
ground
covered
their
retreat
they
bobbed
up
again
one
after
the
other
when
the
lane
was
clear
the
first
to
appear
was
a
tall
handsome
girl
she
spoke
first
it
a
damned
shame
of
them
to
keep
us
waiting
like
this
she
propped
herself
up
against
anthony
wall
and
smouldered
there
in
her
dark
sullen
beauty
we
were
here
at
six
sharp
when
they
know
we
were
told
not
to
let
on
where
we
meet
we
led
into
a
trap
said
a
woman
i
say
who
is
dorothea
harrison
she
the
girl
who
roped
rosalind
in
she
all
right
yes
but
are
her
people
all
right
rosalind
knows
them
the
woman
spoke
again
well
if
you
think
this
lane
is
a
good
place
for
a
secret
meeting
i
do
are
you
aware
that
the
yard
of
straw
castle
is
behind
that
wall
what
to
prevent
them
bringing
up
five
or
six
coppers
and
planting
them
there
why
they
only
got
to
post
one
at
the
top
of
the
lane
and
another
at
the
bottom
and
we
done
trapped
i
call
it
rotten
it
all
right
here
they
are
dorothea
harrison
and
rosalind
jervis
came
down
the
lane
at
a
leisured
stride
their
long
coats
buttoned
up
to
their
chins
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
their
i
gestures
were
devoid
of
secrecy
or
any
guile
each
had
a
joyous
air
of
being
in
command
of
being
able
to
hold
up
the
whole
adventure
at
her
will
or
let
it
rip
rosalind
jervis
was
no
longer
a
bouncing
fluffy
flapper
in
three
years
she
had
shot
up
into
the
stature
of
command
she
slouched
stooping
a
little
from
the
shoulders
and
carried
her
pink
face
thrust
forward
as
if
leaning
from
a
platform
to
address
an
audience
from
this
salience
her
small
chin
retreated
delicately
into
her
pink
throat
is
miss
maud
blackadder
here
she
said
marshalling
her
six
the
handsome
girl
detached
herself
slowly
from
anthony
wall
what
the
point
she
said
of
keeping
us
hanging
about
like
this
till
our
faces
are
known
to
the
police
there
a
johnnie
gone
in
there
who
can
swear
to
why
did
you
two
turn
up
before
said
the
handsome
girl
because
said
dorothea
that
johnnie
was
my
father
he
was
pounding
on
in
front
of
us
all
up
east
heath
road
if
we
got
here
sooner
i
should
have
had
to
introduce
you
she
looked
at
the
six
benevolently
indulgently
they
might
have
been
children
whose
behaviour
amused
her
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
i
avoided
that
introduction
not
because
it
would
have
been
dangerous
and
indiscreet
but
because
it
would
have
spoiled
your
fun
for
you
she
led
the
way
into
the
garden
and
the
house
and
through
the
hall
into
the
schoolroom
there
they
found
eleven
young
girls
who
had
come
much
too
soon
and
mistaking
the
arrangements
had
rung
the
bell
and
allowed
themselves
to
be
shown
in
the
schoolroom
had
been
transformed
into
a
sort
of
meeting
hall
the
big
oblong
table
had
been
drawn
across
one
end
of
it
behind
it
were
chairs
for
the
speakers
before
it
were
three
rows
of
chairs
where
the
eleven
young
girls
sat
scattered
expectant
the
six
stood
in
the
free
space
in
front
of
the
table
and
looked
at
rosalind
with
significance
this
said
rosalind
is
our
hostess
miss
dorothea
harrison
dorothy
i
think
you
met
eden
our
treasurer
this
is
our
secretary
miss
valentina
gilchrist
miss
ethel
farmer
miss
winifred
burstall
dorothy
greeted
in
turn
eden
a
pretty
gentle
woman
with
a
face
of
dreaming
tragedy
it
was
she
who
had
defended
rosalind
outside
the
gate
miss
valentina
gilchrist
a
woman
who
displayed
a
large
grey
pompadour
above
a
rosy
face
with
features
which
when
she
was
not
excited
had
an
incredulous
quizzical
expression
miss
gilchrist
was
the
one
who
had
said
they
had
been
led
into
a
trap
miss
ethel
farmer
fair
attenuated
scholastic
wearing
with
an
air
of
not
seeing
you
and
miss
winifred
burstall
young
at
fifty
wearing
with
an
air
of
seeing
straight
through
you
to
the
other
side
rosalind
went
on
miss
maud
blackadder
miss
blackadder
curt
bow
accused
rosalind
of
wasting
time
in
meaningless
formalities
miss
rosalind
was
at
a
loss
the
other
girl
the
youngest
of
the
eight
came
forward
holding
out
a
slender
hand
she
was
the
one
who
had
hung
with
miss
blackadder
in
the
background
desmond
she
said
phyllis
desmond
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
and
smiled
slightly
as
much
as
to
say
she
forgets
what
she
ought
to
remember
but
it
does
matter
phyllis
desmond
was
beautiful
but
for
the
moment
her
beauty
was
asleep
stilled
into
hardness
dorothy
saw
a
long
slender
face
between
sleek
bands
of
black
hair
black
eyes
dulled
as
if
by
a
subtle
film
like
breath
on
a
black
a
beautiful
slender
mouth
pressed
tight
holding
back
the
secret
of
its
sensual
charm
dorothy
thought
she
had
seen
her
before
but
she
could
remember
where
rosalind
jervis
looked
at
her
watch
with
a
businesslike
air
paper
and
pencils
were
produced
coats
were
thrown
on
the
little
and
benches
in
the
corner
where
dorothy
and
her
brothers
had
sat
at
their
lessons
with
parsons
some
twelve
years
ago
and
the
eight
gathered
about
the
big
table
rosalind
taking
the
presidential
chair
which
had
once
been
parsons
chair
in
the
centre
between
miss
gilchrist
and
miss
blackadder
miss
burstall
and
miss
farmer
looked
at
each
other
and
miss
burstall
spoke
we
understood
that
this
was
to
be
an
informal
meeting
before
we
begin
business
i
should
like
to
ask
one
question
i
should
like
to
know
what
we
are
and
what
we
are
here
for
we
eden
miss
valentina

maud

the
tone
of

punctual
said
miss
farmer
rosalind
did
not
even
look
at
her
the
moment
had
come
to
address
the
meeting
i
take
it
that
we
are
all
agreed
as
to
the
main
issue
that
we
have
not
come
here
to
convert
each
other
that
we
all
want
women
franchise
that
we
all
mean
to
have
it
that
we

to
work
for

and
if
necessary
to
fight
for
it
to
oppose
the
government
that
withholds
it
by
every
means
in
our
power
by
every
constitutional
means
miss
burstall
amended
and
was
told
by
miss
gilchrist
that

she
desired

be
regular
she
must
not
interrupt
the
to
oppose
the
government
that

us
the
vote
whatever
government
it
may
be
regardless
of
party
by
means
in
our
rosalind
sentences
were
punctuated
by
a
rhythmic
sound
of
tapping
miss
maud
blackadder
twisted
sideways
on
the
chair
she
had
pushed
farther
and
farther
back
from
the
table
so
as
to
bring
herself
completely
out
of
line
with
the
other
seven
from
time
to
time
rhythmically
twitching
with
impatience
struck
her
own
leg
with
her
own
rosalind
perorated
if
we
differ
we
differ
not
as
to
our
end
but
solely
as
to
the
means
we
personally
and
individually
are
prepared
to
employ
she
looked
round
agreed
not
agreed
said
dorothy
and
miss
burstall
and
miss
farmer
all
at
once
i
will
now
call
on
miss
maud
blackadder
to
speak
she
will
explain
to
those
of
you
who
are
strangers
she
glanced
comprehensively
at
the
eleven
young
girls
the
present
program
of
the
union
i

miss
burstall
there
has
been
confusion

at
sixes
and
sevens
i
protest

miss
farmer
frowning
and
blinking
in
an
agony
of
protest
silence
if
you
please
for
the
chairwoman
said
miss
gilchrist
may
we
not
say
one
word
you
may
said
rosalind
in
your
turn
i
now
call
on
miss
blackadder
to
speak
at
the
sound
of
her
own
name
miss
blackadder
jumped
to
her
feet
the
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
light
clatter
and
crash
preluding
her
storm
she
jerked
out
her
words
at
a
headlong
pace
as
if
to
make
up
for
the
time
the
others
had
wasted
in
futilities
i
am
not
going
to
say
much
i
am
not
going
to
take
up
your
time
too
much
time
has
been
lost
already
i
am
not
a
speaker
i
am
not
a
writer
i
am
not
an
intellectual
woman
and
if
you
ask
me
what
i
am
and
what
i
am
here
for
and
what
i
am
doing
in
the
union
and
what
the
union
is
doing
with
me
and
what
possible
use
i
an
untrained
girl
can
be
to
you
clever
women
she
looked
tempestuously
at
miss
burstall
and
miss
farmer
who
did
not
flinch
i
will
tell
you
i
am
a
fighter
i
am
here
to
enlist
volunteers
i
am
the
recruiting
sergeant
for
this
district
that
is
the
use
my
leaders
who
should
be
leaders
are
making
of
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
body
swayed
rocked
from
side
to
side
with
the
violent
rhythm
of
her
speech
if
you
ask
me
why
they
have
chosen
i
will
tell
you
it
because
i
know
what
i
want
and
because
i
know
how
to
get
what
i
want
i
know
what
i
want
oh
yes
you
think
that
nothing
you
all

you
know
what
you
want
but
do
you
you
of
course
we
do
we
want
the
vote
nothing
but
the
vote
but
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
can
you
even
say
you
want
it
till
you
know
whether
there
are
things
you
want
more
what
are
you
driving
at
you

i
ride
straight
and
i
do

my
fences

vote

you
know
how
much
you
want
it
do
you
know
how
much
you
want
to
pay
for
it
do
you
know
what
prepared
to
give
up
for
it
because
if
you
do
know
you
know
how
much
you
want
it
we
want
it
as
much
as
you
do
i
imagine
you
want
it
as
much
as
i
do
good
you
going
to
pay
the
price
whatever
the
price
is
you
ready
to
give
up
everything
else
your
homes
and
your
families
and
your
friends
and
your
incomes
until
you
enfranchised
you
are
not
going
to
own
any
as
father
or
brother
or
husband
her
voice
rang
with
a
deeper
and
stronger
vibration
or
lover
or
friend
and
the
man
who
does
not
agree
with
you
the
man
who
refuses
you
the
vote
the
man
who
opposes
your
efforts
to
get
the
vote
the
man
who
whether
he
agrees
with
you
or
not
not
help
you
to
get
you
count
as
your
enemy
that
is
wanting
the
vote
that
is
wanting
it
as
much
as
i
do
you
women
are
you
prepared
to
go
against
your
men
to
give
up
your
men
there
were
cries
of
rather
from
two
of
the
eleven
young
girls
who
had
come
too
soon
miss
burstall
shook
her
head
and
murmured
hopeless
confusion
of
thought
if
is
what
it
going
to
be
like
heaven
help
us
you
really
getting
a
bit
mixed
said
dorothy
we
protest
protest
then
protest
as
much
as
you
like
then
we
shall
know
where
we
are
then
we
shall
get
things
straight
then
we
can
begin
you
all
want
the
vote
some
of
you
do
know
how
much
but
at
least
you
know
you
want
it
nobody
confused
about
that
do
you
know
how
you
going
to
get
it
tell
me
that
lest
they
should
spoil
it
all
by
telling
her
miss
blackadder
increased
her
vehement
pace
you
do
because
you
ca
and
will
tell
you
you
wo
get
it
by
talking
about
it
or
by
writing
about
it
or
by
sitting
down
and
thinking
about
it
you
get
it
by
coming
in
with
me
coming
in
with
the
women
franchise
union
and
fighting
for
it
fighting
women
not
talkers
not
writers
not
thinkers
are
what
we
want
she
sat
down
heaving
a
little
with
the
of
her
storm
amid
applause
in
which
only
miss
burstall
and
miss
farmer
did
not
join
she
was
now
looking
extraordinarily
handsome
rosalind
bent
over
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
she
rose
to
her
feet
again
flushed
smiling
at
them
triumphant
our
chairwoman
has
reminded
me
that
i
came
here
to
tell
you
what
the
program
of
our
union
is
and
i
can
tell
you
in
six
words
and
it
now
said
rosalind
sweetly
bowing
towards
miss
burstall
it
your
turn
we
should
like
to
know
what
you
have
to
say
miss
burstall
did
not
rise
and
in
the
end
dorothea
spoke
my
friend
miss
rosalind
jervis
assumed
that
we
were
all
agreed
not
only
as
to
our
aims
but
as
to
our
policy
she
has
not
yet
discriminated
between
constitutional
and
unconstitutional
means
when
we
protested
she
quashed
our
protest
we
took
exception
to
the
phrase
means
in
our
power
because
that
would
commit
us
to
all
sorts
of
unconstitutional
things
it
is
in
my
power
to
squirt
water
into
the
back
of
the
prime
minister
neck
or
to
land
a
bomb
in
the
small
of
his
back
or
in
the
centre
of
the
platform
at
his
next
public
meeting
we
were
left
to
conclude
that
the
only
differences
between
us
would
concern
our
choice
of
the
squirt
or
the
bomb
as
some
of
us
here
might
equally
object
to
using
the
bomb
or
the
squirt
i
submit
that
either
our
protest
should
have
been
allowed
or
our
agreement
should
not
have
been
taken
for
granted
at
the
start
again
miss
maud
blackadder
in
her
sporting
speech
her
heroic
speech
has
not
cleared
the
question
she
has
appealed
to
us
to
come
in
without
counting
the
cost
but
she
has
said
nothing
to
convince
us
that
when
our
account
at
our
bank
is
overdrawn
and
we
have
declared
war
on
all
our
male
friends
and
relations
and
have
left
our
comfortable
homes
and
are
all
camping
out
on
the
open
heath
i
repeat
she
has
said
nothing
to
convince
us
that
the
price
we
shall
have
paid
is
going
to
get
us
the
thing
we
want
she
says
that
fighters
are
wanted
and
not
talkers
and
writers
and
thinkers
are
we
not
then
to
fight
with
our
tongues
and
with
our
brains
is
she
leaving
us
anything
but
our
bare
fists
she
has
told
us
that
she
rides
straight
and
that
she
does
funk
her
fences
but
she
has
not
told
us
what
sort
of
country
she
is
going
to
ride
over
nor
where
the
fences
are
not
what
and
means
we
want
meaning
we
want
clearness
and
precision
we
have
not
been
given
it
yet
i
would
let
all
this
pass
if
miss
blackadder
were
not
your
is
it
fair
to
call
for
volunteers
for
raw
recruits
and
not
tell
them
precisely
and
clearly
what
services
will
be
required
of
them
how
many
dorothy
glanced
at
the
eleven
realize
that
the
leaders
of
your
union
and
blathwaite
and
miss
angela
blathwaite
demand
from
its
members
blind
unquestioning
obedience
maud
blackadder
jumped
up
i
protest
i
too
have
the
right
to
protest
miss
harrison
calls
me
to
order
she
tells
me
to
be
clear
and
precise
will
she
be
good
enough
to
be
clear
and
precise
herself
will
she
say
whether
she
is
with
us
or
against
us
if
she
is
not
with
us
she
is
against
us
let
her
explain
her
position
she
sat
down
and
rosalind
rose
miss
harrison
she
said
will
explain
her
position
to
the
committee
later
this
is
an
open
meeting
till
seven
it
is
now
five
minutes
to
will
any
of
you
here
she
held
the
eleven
with
her
eyes
who
were
not
present
at
the
meeting
in
the
town
hall
last
monday
hold
up
your
hands
no
hands
then
you
must
all
be
aware
of
the
object
and
the
policy
and
the
rules
of
the
women
franchise
union
its
members
pledge
themselves
to
help
as
far
as
they
can
the
object
of
the
union
to
support
the
decisions
of
their
leaders
to
abstain
from
public
and
private
criticism
of
those
decisions
and
of
any
words
or
actions
of
their
leaders
and
to
obey
orders
not
blindly
or
unquestioningly
but
within
the
terms
of
their
undertakings
those
of
you
who
wish
to
join
us
will
please
write
your
names
and
addresses
on
the
slips
of
white
paper
stating
what
kind
of
work
you
are
willing
to
do
and
the
amount
of
your
subscription
if
you
subscribe
and
hand
your
slips
to
the
secretary
at
the
door
as
you
go
out
miss
burstall
and
miss
farmer
went
out
miss
blackadder
counted
one
two
eight
of
the
eleven
young
girls
signed
and
handed
in
the
white
slips
at
the
door
and
went
out
three
four
miss
blackadder
reckoned
that
dorothea
harrison
speech
had
cost
her
five
recruits
her
own
fighting
speech
had
carried
the
eleven
in
a
compact
body
to
her
side
dorothea
speech
had
divided
and
scattered
them
again
miss
blackadder
hurled
her
personality
at
the
heads
of
audiences
in
the
certainty
that
it
would
hit
them
hard
that
was
what
she
was
there
for
she
knew
that
the
women
franchise
union
relied
on
her
to
wring
from
herself
the
utmost
spectacular
effect
and
she
did
it
every
time
she
never
once
missed
fire
and
dorothea
harrison
had
come
down
on
the
top
of
her
triumph
and
destroyed
the
effect
of
all
her
fire
she
had
corrupted
five
recruits
and
supposing
there
was
a
secret
program
she
had
betrayed
the
women
of
the
union
to
fourteen
outsiders
by
giving
it
away
treachery
or
no
treachery
dorothea
harrison
would
have
to
pay
for
it
everybody
had
gone
except
the
members
of
the
committee
and
phyllis
desmond
who
waited
for
her
friend
maud
blackadder
dorothy
remembered
phyllis
desmond
now
she
was
that
girl
that
vera
knew
she
had
seen
her
at
vera
house
they
had
drawn
round
the
table
again
miss
blackadder
and
miss
gilchrist
conferred
in
whispers
before
we
go
said
rosalind
i
propose
that
we
ask
miss
dorothea
harrison
to
be
our
miss
gilchrist
nodded
to
miss
blackadder
who
rose
it
was
her
moment
and
propose
she
said
that
before
we
invite
miss
harrison
to
be
anything
we
ask
her
to
define
her
position
clearly
and
precisely
she
made
a
sign
and
the
secretary
was
on
her
feet
and
first
we
must
ask
miss
harrison
to
explain
she
became
possessed
of
the
secret
policy
of
the
union
which
has
never
been
discussed
at
any
open
meeting
and
is
unknown
to
members
of
the
general
committee
then
said
dorothy
there
a
secret
policy
you
seem
to
know
it
we
have
the
right
to
ask
you
know
unless
you
invented
it
dorothy
faced
them
it
was
inconceivable
that
it
should
have
happened
that
she
should
be
standing
there
in
the
old
schoolroom
of
her
house
while
two
strange
women
worried
her
she
knew
that
her
back
was
to
the
wall
and
that
the
blackadder
girl
had
been
on
the
watch
for
the
last
to
get
her
knife
into
her
odd
for
she
had
admired
the
blackadder
girl
and
her
fighting
gestures
it
was
inconceivable
that
she
should
have
to
answer
to
that
absurd
committee
for
her
honour
it
was
inconceivable
that
rosalind
her
friend
should
not
help
her
yet
it
had
happened
with
all
her
platform
eloquence
rosalind
could
for
the
life
of
her
get
out
one
heroic
defending
word
from
the
moment
when
the
gilchrist
woman
had
pounced
rosalind
had
simply
sat
and
stared
like
a
rabbit
like
a
fish
her
mouth
open
for
the
word
that
would
not
come
rosalind
was
afraid
to
stand
up
for
her
it
was
dreadful
and
it
was
funny
to
see
rosalind
looking
like
that
and
to
realize
the
extent
of
her
weakness
and
her
obstinacy
yet
rosalind
had
not
changed
she
was
still
the
slacker
who
could
never
do
a
stroke
of
work
until
somebody
had
pushed
her
into
it
who
could
never
leave
off
working
until
stopped
by
the
same
hand
that
had
set
her
going
her
power
to
go
and
to
let
herself
rip
and
the
weakness
that
made
her
depend
on
dorothy
to
start
her
were
the
qualities
that
attracted
dorothy
to
rosalind
from
the
beginning
but
now
she
was
the
tool
of
the
fighting
suffrage
women
or
if
she
was
a
tool
she
was
a
machine
her
brain
was
a
rapid
docile
mechanical
apparatus
for
turning
out
bad
imitations
of
and
the
two
blathwaites
her
air
of
casual
command
her
stoop
and
the
thrusting
forward
of
her
face
were
copied
sedulously
from
an
admired
model
dorothy
found
her
pitiable
she
was
hypnotized
by
the
blathwaites
who
worked
her
and
would
throw
her
away
when
she
was
of
no
more
use
she
had
the
strength
to
resist
the
pull
and
the
grip
and
the
drive
of
other
people
she
could
even
hold
out
against
valentina
gilchrist
and
maud
blackadder
rosalind
would
always
be
caught
and
spun
round
by
any
movement
that
was
strong
enough
she
was
foredoomed
to
the
vortex
that
was
dorothy
fault
it
was
she
who
had
pushed
and
pulled
the
slacker
in
spite
of
her
almost
whining
protest
to
the
edge
of
the
vortex
and
it
was
rosalind
not
dorothy
who
had
been
caught
and
sucked
down
into
the
swirl
she
whirled
in
it
now
and
would
go
on
whirling
under
the
impression
that
her
movements
made
it
move
the
vortex
fascinated
dorothy
even
while
she
resisted
it
she
liked
the
feeling
of
her
own
power
to
resist
to
keep
her
head
to
beat
up
against
the
rush
of
the
whirlwind
to
wheel
round
and
round
outside
it
and
swerve
away
before
the
thing
got
her
for
dorothy
was
afraid
of
the
feminist
vortex
as
her
brother
michael
had
been
afraid
of
the
little
vortex
of
school
she
was
afraid
of
the
herded
women
she
disliked
the
excited
faces
and
the
high
voices
skirling
their
and
the
silly
business
of
committees
and
the
platform
slang
she
was
sick
and
shy
before
the
tremor
and
the
surge
of
collective
feeling
she
loathed
the
gestures
and
the
movements
of
the
collective
soul
the
swaying
and
heaving
and
rushing
forward
of
the
many
as
one
she
would
not
be
carried
away
by
it
she
would
keep
the
clearness
and
hardness
of
her
soul
it
was
her
soul
they
wanted
these
women
of
the
union
the
blathwaites
and
the
and
rosalind
and
the
blackadder
girl
and
the
gilchrist
woman
they
ran
out
after
her
like
a
hungry
pack
yelping
for
her
soul
and
she
was
not
going
to
throw
it
to
them
she
would
fight
for
freedom
but
not
in
their
way
and
not
at
their
bidding
she
was
her
brother
michael
refusing
to
go
to
the
party
refusing
to
run
with
the
school
herd
holding
out
for
his
private
soul
against
other
people
who
kept
him
from
remembering
only
michael
did
not
hold
out
he
ran
away
she
would
stay
on
the
edge
of
the
vortex
fascinated
by
its
danger
and
resisting
but
as
she
looked
at
them
at
rosalind
with
her
open
mouth
at
the
blackadder
girl
who
was
scowling
horribly
and
at
valentina
gilchrist
sceptical
and
quizzical
she
laughed
the
three
had
been
trying
to
rush
her
and
because
they
could
rush
her
they
were
questioning
her
honour
she
had
asked
them
plainly
for
a
plain
meaning
and
their
idea
of
apt
repartee
was
to
pretend
to
question
her
honour
perhaps
they
really
did
question
it
she
did
care
she
loathed
their
excited
silly
hurrying
suspicion
but
she
did
care
it
was
she
who
had
drawn
them
and
led
them
on
to
this
display
of
incomparable
idiocy
like
her
brother
nicholas
she
found
that
adversity
was
extremely
funny
and
she
laughed
she
was
no
longer
michael
she
was
nicky
not
caring
delighting
in
her
power
to
fool
them
you
think
she
said
i
no
business
to
find
out
your
knowledge
would
certainly
have
been
mysterious
said
the
secretary
unless
at
least
two
confidences
had
been
betrayed
supposing
there
had
been
any
secret
policy
well
you
see
i
do
know
it
and
i
did
invent
it
and
i
find
it
out
precisely
your
secret
policy
is
the
logical
conclusion
of
your
present
policy
i
deduced
it
that
all
anybody
could
have
done
the
same
does
that
satisfy
you
they
wo
love
me
any
better
for
making
them
look
fools
thank
you
said
miss
gilchrist
we
only
wanted
to
be
sure
the
rang
as
dorothy
was
defining
her
position
i
work
for
you
i
speak
for
you
i
write
for
you
i
fight
for
you
i
make
hay
of
every
government
meeting
if
i
can
get
in
without
lying
and
sneaking
for
it
i
go
to
prison
for
you
if
i
can
choose
my
own
crime
but
i
wo
give
up
my
liberty
of
speech
and
thought
and
action
i
wo
pledge
myself
to
obey
your
orders
i
pledge
myself
not
to
criticize
policy
i
disapprove
of
i
wo
come
on
your
committee
and
i
wo
join
your
union
is
that
clear
and
precise
enough
somebody
clapped
and
somebody
said
hear
hear
and
somebody
said
go
it
dorothy
it
was
anthony
and
frances
and
captain
drayton
who
paused
outside
the
door
on
their
way
to
the
and
listened
basely
they
were
all
going
now
dorothy
stood
at
the
door
holding
it
open
for
them
glad
that
it
was
all
over
only
phyllis
desmond
the
lingered
dorothy
reminded
her
that
they
had
met
at
her
aunt
vera
harrison
house
the
smiled
i
wondered
when
you
were
going
to
remember
i
did
but
they
all
called
you
desmond
that
what
put
me
out
everybody
calls
me
desmond
you
had
a
brother
or
something
with
you
had
you
i
might
have
had
two
which
michael
got
green
eyes
and
yellow
hair
nicky
got
blue
eyes
and
black
hair
it
was
nicky
nice
name
then
desmond
beauty
stirred
in
its
sleep
the
film
of
air
was
lifted
from
her
black
eyes
i
dining
with
harrison
she
said
you
be
late
then
it
does
matter
lawrence
stephen
never
there
till
after
eight
she
wo
dine
without
him
dorothy
stiffened
she
did
not
like
that
furtive
betrayal
of
vera
and
lawrence
stephen
i
wish
you
come
and
see
me
at
my
rooms
in
chelsea
and
bring
your
brother
not
the
green
and
yellow
one
the
blue
and
black
one
dorothy
took
the
card
on
which
desmond
had
scribbled
an
address
but
she
did
not
mean
to
go
and
see
her
she
was
sure
that
she
liked
desmond
rosalind
stayed
on
to
dine
with
dorothy
family
she
was
no
longer
living
with
her
own
family
for
jervis
was
hostile
to
franchise
she
had
rooms
off
the
strand
not
far
from
the
headquarters
of
the
union
frances
looked
a
little
careworn
she
had
been
sent
for
to
house
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
aunt
emmeline
and
had
found
as
usual
that
nothing
could
be
done
with
her
in
the
last
three
years
the
second
miss
fleming
had
become
less
and
less
enthusiastic
and
more
and
more
emphatic
till
she
ceased
from
enthusiasm
altogether
and
carried
emphasis
beyond
the
bounds
of
sanity
she
had
become
as
frances
put
it
extremely
tiresome
it
was
not
accurate
to
say
as
fleming
did
that
you
never
knew
when
emmeline
would
start
a
nervous
crisis
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
could
time
her
to
a
minute
it
was
her
habit
to
wait
till
her
family
was
absorbed
in
some
urgent
affair
that
diverted
attention
from
her
case
and
then
to
break
out
alarmingly
dorothy
was
generally
sent
for
to
bring
her
round
but
it
was
dorothy
who
had
important
things
on
hand
aunt
emmeline
had
scented
the
suffrage
meeting
from
afar
and
had
made
arrangements
beforehand
for
a
supreme
crisis
that
would
take
all
the
shine
out
of
dorothy
affair
when
frances
said
that
aunt
emmy
had
been
tiresome
again
dorothy
knew
what
she
meant
for
aunt
emmy
idea
was
that
her
sisters
persecuted
her
that
edie
was
jealous
of
her
and
hated
her
that
louie
had
always
trampled
on
her
and
kept
her
under
that
frances
had
used
her
influence
with
grannie
to
spoil
all
her
chances
one
after
another
it
was
all
frances
fault
that
vera
harrison
had
come
between
her
and
major
cameron
frances
had
encouraged
vera
in
her
infamous
intrigue
and
between
them
they
had
wrecked
two
lives
and
they
had
killed
major
cameron
since
ferdie
death
emmeline
fleming
had
lived
most
of
the
time
in
a
sort
of
dream
in
which
it
seemed
to
her
that
these
things
had
really
happened
this
afternoon
she
had
been
more
than
usually
tiresome
she
had
simply
raved
you
should
have
brought
her
round
to
the
meeting
said
dorothy
and
let
her
rave
there
i
back
aunt
emmeline
against
maud
blackadder
i
wish
rosalind
you
leave
off
making
faces
and
kicking
my
shins
you
need
worry
any
more
mummy
ducky
i
going
to
rope
them
all
into
the
suffrage
movement
aunt
edie
can
distribute
literature
aunt
louie
can
interrupt
like
anything
and
aunt
emmeline
can
shout
and
sing
i
think
dorothy
said
rosalind
with
weak
bitterness
that
you
might
have
stuck
by
me
the
two
were
walking
down
east
heath
road
to
the
where
the
motor
buses
started
for
charing
cross
it
was
you
who
dragged
me
into
it
and
the
least
you
could
do
was
to
stick
why
did
you
keep
quiet
instead
of
forcing
our
hands
i
could
keep
quiet
i
go
with
you
straight
or
i
wo
go
with
you
at
all
you
know
what
the
matter
with
you
it
your
family
you
never
be
any
good
to
us
you
never
be
any
good
to
yourself
till
you
chucked
them
and
got
away
for
years
ever
since
you
been
born
you
simply
been
stewing
there
in
the
family
juice
until
you
soaked
with
it
you
ought
to
be
living
at
home
you
ought
to
be
on
your
own
like
me
you
talking
rot
rosalind
if
my
people
were
like
yours
i
have
to
chuck
them
i
suppose
but
they
not
they
angels
that
why
they
so
dangerous
they
could
influence
you
if
they
were
angels
they
do
influence
me
the
least
little
bit
i
like
to
see
them
try
they
much
too
clever
they
know
i
be
off
like
a
shot
if
they
did
why
they
let
me
do
every
mortal
thing
i
please
turn
the
schoolroom
into
a
meeting
hall
for
your
friends
to
play
the
devil
in
that
blackadder
girl
was
yelling
the
house
down
yet
they
did
say
anything
and
your
people
are
as
bad
as
you
make
out
you
know
you
could
live
on
your
own
if
your
father
did
give
you
an
allowance
i
like
mrs
jervis
because
she
likes
you
well
that
a
reason
it
is
the
reason
why
i
like
my
own
mother
because
she
does
like
me
so
very
much
that
why
she
lets
me
do
what
i
like
she
does
care
enough
to
stop
me
she
only
really
cares
for
dad
and
john
and
nicky
and
michael
rosalind
looked
fierce
and
stubborn
that
what
the
matter
with
all
of
you
she
said
what
is
caring
like
that
it
all
sex
sex
instinct
sex
feeling
right
it
what
we
up
against
all
the
time
dorothy
said
to
herself
that
what
the
matter
with
rosalind
if
she
only
knew
it
rosalind
loved
michael
and
michael
detested
her
and
nicky
did
like
her
very
much
she
always
looked
fierce
and
stubborn
when
she
heard
michael
name
rosalind
went
on
when
it
comes
to
sex
you
do
revolt
you
sit
down
i
do
revolt
i
revolting
now
i
go
much
farther
than
you
do
i
think
the
marriage
laws
are
rotten
i
think
divorce
ought
to
be
for
incompatibility
i
think
love
is
love
and
ca
last
unless
free
i
think
marriage
ought
to
be
abolished
not
yet
perhaps
but
when
we
become
civilized
it
will
be
it
bound
to
be
as
it
is
i
think
every
woman
has
a
right
to
have
a
baby
if
she
wants
one
if
emmeline
had
had
a
baby
she
would
be
devastating
us
now
that
what
you
think
but
it
is
what
you
feel
it
all
thinking
with
you
dorothy
the
revolt
goes
on
in
your
brain
you
never
do
anything
it
is
that
you
have
the
courage
to
go
against
your
men
you
have
the
will
you
do
want
to
why
should
i
what
do
they
do
father
and
michael
and
nicky
interfere
with
me
any
more
than
mother
does
you
know
i
not
thinking
of
them
they
do
really
matter
who
are
you
thinking
of
then
frank
drayton
you
need
it
was
mean
of
rosalind
to
hit
below
the
belt
like
that
when
she
knew
that
was
safe
michael
had
never
been
brought
against
her
and
never
would
be
it
was
disgusting
of
her
to
imply
that
dorothy
state
of
mind
was
palpable
when
her
own
though
sufficiently
advertised
by
her
behaviour
had
received
from
michael
sister
the
consecration
of
silence
as
a
secret
tragic
thing
they
had
reached
the
at
the
sight
of
the
charing
cross
rosalind
assumed
an
air
of
rollicking
adventurous
travel
my
hat
what
an
evening
i
shall
have
a
ripping
ride
down
do
say
there
no
room
on
the
top
cheer
up
dorothy
which
showed
that
rosalind
jervis
was
a
free
woman
suggested
that
life
had
richer
thrills
than
marrying
dorothy
brother
michael
and
fixed
the
detested
imputation
securely
on
her
friend
dorothy
watched
her
as
she
swung
herself
on
to
the
footboard
and
up
the
stair
of
the
motor
bus
there
was
room
on
the
top
rosalind
in
fact
had
the
top
all
to
herself
as
dorothy
crossed
the
heath
again
in
the
twilight
she
saw
something
white
on
the
terrace
of
her
father
house
her
mother
was
waiting
for
her
she
thought
at
first
that
aunt
emmeline
had
gone
off
her
head
and
that
she
had
been
sent
for
to
keep
her
quiet
she
gloried
in
their
dependence
on
her
but
no
that
was
likely
her
mother
was
just
watching
for
her
as
she
used
to
watch
for
her
and
the
boys
when
they
were
little
and
had
been
sent
across
the
heath
to
grannie
house
with
a
message
and
at
the
sight
and
memory
of
her
mother
dorothy
felt
a
childish
sick
dissatisfaction
with
herself
and
with
her
day
and
an
absurd
longing
for
the
tranquillity
and
safety
of
the
home
whose
chief
drawback
lately
had
been
that
it
was
too
tranquil
and
too
safe
she
could
almost
have
told
her
mother
how
they
had
all
gone
for
her
and
how
rosalind
had
turned
out
rotten
and
how
beastly
it
had
all
been
almost
but
not
quite
dorothy
had
grown
up
and
she
was
there
to
protect
and
not
to
be
protected
however
agreeable
it
might
have
been
to
confide
in
her
mother
it
would
have
done
frances
met
her
at
the
garden
door
she
had
been
crying
nicky
come
home
she
said
nicky
he
been
sent
down
whatever
for
darling
i
ca
possibly
tell
you
but
in
the
end
she
did
xii
up
till
now
frances
had
taken
a
quiet
interest
in
women
suffrage
it
had
got
itself
into
the
papers
and
thus
become
part
of
the
affairs
of
the
nation
the
names
of
and
blathwaite
and
angela
blathwaite
had
got
into
the
papers
where
frances
hoped
and
prayed
that
the
name
of
dorothea
harrison
might
not
follow
them
the
spectacle
of
a
frantic
government
at
grips
with
the
women
franchise
union
had
not
yet
received
the
accorded
to
the
reports
of
divorce
and
breach
of
promise
cases
and
fires
in
paraffin
shops
still
it
was
beginning
to
figure
and
if
frances
ignored
it
there
were
other
papers
that
dorothy
brought
home
but
for
frances
the
affairs
of
the
nation
sank
into
insignificance
beside
nicky
cambridge
affair
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
nicky
affair
was
serious
you
could
not
anthony
said
get
over
the
letters
the
master
letter
and
the
professor
letter
and
michael
they
had
arrived
one
hour
after
nicky
nicky
so
changed
from
his
former
candour
that
he
refused
to
give
any
account
of
himself
beyond
the
simple
statement
that
he
had
been
sent
down
they
know
he
had
said
soon
enough
why
and
soon
enough
they
did
know
to
be
sure
no
details
could
be
disentangled
from
the
discreet
ambiguities
of
the
master
and
the
professor
but
michael
letter
was
more
explicit
nicky
had
been
sent
down
because
old
booster
had
got
it
into
his
head
that
nicky
had
been
making
love
to
booster
wife
when
she
did
want
to
be
made
love
to
and
nothing
could
get
it
out
of
booster
head
michael
was
bound
to
stand
up
for
his
brother
and
it
was
clear
to
anthony
that
so
grave
a
charge
could
hardly
have
been
brought
without
some
reason
the
tone
of
the
letters
especially
the
professor
was
extraordinarily
restrained
that
was
what
made
the
thing
stand
out
in
its
sheer
awfulness
the
professor
although
according
to
michael
he
conceived
himself
to
be
profoundly
injured
wrote
sorrowfully
in
consideration
of
nicky
youth
there
was
one
redeeming
circumstance
the
master
and
the
professor
both
laid
stress
on
it
anthony
son
had
not
attempted
to
deny
it
there
must
frances
said
wildly
be
some
terrible
mistake
but
nicky
cut
the
ground
from
under
the
theory
of
the
terrible
mistake
by
continuing
in
his
refusal
to
deny
it
what
sort
of
woman
said
anthony
is
the
professor
wife
oh
awfully
decent
said
nicky
you
had
no
encouragement
then
no
provocation
she
awfully
fascinating
said
nicky
then
frances
had
another
thought
it
seemed
to
her
that
nicky
was
evading
are
you
sure
you
not
screening
somebody
else
screening
somebody
else
do
you
mean
some
other
fellow
yes
i
not
asking
you
to
give
the
name
nicky
i
swear
i
not
why
should
i
be
i
ca
think
why
you
all
making
such
a
fuss
about
it
i
do
mean
poor
old
he
got
some
cause
if
you
like
but
what
was
it
you
did
really
did
nicky
you
read
the
letters
mother
nicky
adolescence
seemed
to
die
and
pass
from
him
there
and
then
and
she
saw
a
stubborn
hard
virility
that
frightened
and
repelled
her
forcing
her
to
believe
that
it
might
have
really
happened
to
frances
the
awfulness
of
it
was
beyond
belief
and
the
pathos
of
her
belief
in
nicky
was
unbearable
to
anthony
there
were
the
letters
i
think
dear
anthony
said
you
better
leave
us
may
i
stay
it
was
as
if
she
thought
that
by
staying
she
could
bring
nicky
youth
back
to
life
again
no
said
anthony
she
went
and
nicky
opened
the
door
for
her
his
hard
tight
man
face
looked
at
her
as
if
it
had
been
she
who
had
sinned
and
he
who
suffered
intolerably
for
her
sin
the
click
of
the
door
as
he
shut
it
stabbed
her
it
a
damnable
business
father
we
better
not
talk
about
it
but
anthony
would
talk
about
it
and
when
he
had
done
talking
all
that
nicky
had
to
say
was
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
these
things
happen
for
nicky
had
thought
it
out
very
carefully
beforehand
in
the
train
what
else
could
he
say
he
could
tell
them
that
booster
poor
little
wife
had
lost
her
head
and
made
hysterical
love
to
him
and
had
been
so
frightened
at
what
she
had
done
that
she
had
made
him
promise
on
his
word
of
honour
that
whatever
happened
he
would
give
her
away
to
anybody
not
even
to
his
own
people
he
supposed
that
either
peggy
had
given
herself
away
or
that
poor
old
booster
had
found
her
out
he
supposed
that
having
found
her
out
there
was
no
other
line
that
booster
could
have
taken
anyhow
there
was
no
other
line
that
could
take
because
in
the
world
where
these
things
happened
being
found
out
would
be
fifty
times
worse
for
peggy
than
it
would
be
for
him
he
tried
to
recall
the
scene
in
the
back
where
she
had
asked
him
so
often
to
have
tea
with
her
alone
the
most
vivid
part
was
the
end
of
it
after
he
had
given
his
promise
peggy
had
broken
down
and
put
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
like
anything
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
nicky
thought
of
booster
and
how
awful
and
yet
how
funny
it
would
be
if
he
walked
into
the
room
and
saw
him
there
he
had
tried
hard
not
to
think
what
booster
face
would
look
like
he
had
tried
hard
not
to
laugh
as
long
as
peggy
head
was
on
his
shoulder
for
fear
of
hurting
her
feelings
but
when
she
took
it
off
he
did
give
one
snort
for
it
really
was
the
rummest
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
he
did
know
and
he
could
possibly
have
guessed
that
as
soon
as
the
door
had
shut
on
him
peggy
passion
had
turned
to
rage
and
utter
detestation
of
nicky
for
she
had
heard
the
snort
and
that
she
had
gone
straight
to
her
husband
study
and
put
her
head
on
shoulder
and
cried
and
told
him
a
lie
and
that
it
was
peggy
lie
and
not
the
professor
imagination
that
had
caused
him
to
be
sent
down
and
even
if
peggy
had
not
been
lord
somebody
daughter
and
related
to
all
sorts
of
influential
people
she
would
still
have
been
capable
of
turning
every
male
head
in
the
university
for
she
was
a
small
gentle
woman
with
enchanting
manners
and
the
most
beautiful
and
pathetic
eyes
and
she
had
not
yet
been
found
out
therefore
it
was
more
likely
that
an
undergraduate
with
a
face
like
nicky
should
lose
his
head
than
that
a
woman
with
a
face
like
peggy
should
for
no
conceivable
reason
tell
a
lie
so
that
even
if
nicky
word
of
honour
had
not
been
previously
pledged
to
his
accuser
it
would
have
had
no
chance
against
any
statement
that
she
chose
to
make
and
even
if
he
had
known
that
she
had
lied
he
could
very
well
have
given
it
against
poor
pretty
peggy
who
had
lost
her
head
and
got
frightened
as
nicky
packed
up
his
clothes
and
his
books
he
said
i
do
care
if
i
am
sent
down
it
would
have
been
fifty
times
worse
for
her
than
it
is
for
me
he
had
no
idea
how
bad
it
was
nor
how
much
worse
it
was
going
to
be
for
it
ended
in
his
going
that
night
from
his
father
house
to
the
house
in
john
wood
where
vera
and
lawrence
stephen
lived
and
it
was
there
that
he
met
desmond
nicky
congratulated
himself
on
having
pulled
it
off
so
well
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he
had
taken
his
father
and
mother
in
he
might
have
understood
it
if
he
had
known
that
vera
had
been
before
him
and
that
she
had
warned
them
long
ago
that
this
was
precisely
the
sort
of
thing
they
would
have
to
look
out
for
and
as
no
opinion
ever
uttered
on
the
subject
of
their
children
was
likely
to
be
forgotten
by
frances
and
anthony
when
this
particular
disaster
came
they
were
more
prepared
for
it
than
they
would
have
believed
possible
but
there
were
two
members
of
his
family
whom
nicky
had
failed
altogether
to
convince
michael
and
dorothy
michael
luckily
nicky
said
to
himself
was
not
on
the
spot
and
his
letter
had
no
weight
against
the
letters
of
the
master
and
the
professor
and
on
this
also
nicky
had
calculated
he
reckoned
without
dorothy
judging
it
hardly
likely
that
she
would
be
allowed
to
know
anything
about
it
nobody
not
even
frances
was
yet
aware
of
dorothy
importance
and
dorothy
because
of
her
importance
blamed
herself
for
all
that
happened
afterwards
if
she
had
not
had
that
damned
suffrage
meeting
rosalind
would
not
have
stayed
to
dinner
if
rosalind
had
not
stayed
to
dinner
she
would
not
have
gone
with
her
to
the
if
she
had
not
gone
with
her
to
the
she
would
have
been
at
home
to
stop
nicky
from
going
to
john
wood
as
it
was
nicky
had
reached
the
main
road
at
the
top
of
the
lane
just
as
dorothy
was
entering
it
from
the
bottom
at
first
frances
did
not
want
dorothy
to
see
her
father
he
was
most
horribly
upset
and
must
not
be
disturbed
but
dorothy
insisted
her
father
had
the
letters
and
she
must
see
the
letters
i
may
understand
them
better
than
you
or
daddy
she
said
you
see
mummy
i
know
these
cambridge
people
they
awful
asses
some
of
them
and
though
her
mother
doubted
whether
attendance
at
the
lectures
would
give
dorothy
much
insight
into
the
affair
she
had
her
way
anthony
was
too
weak
to
resist
her
he
pushed
the
letters
towards
her
without
a
word
he
would
rather
she
had
been
left
out
of
it
and
yet
somehow
the
sight
of
her
coming
in
so
robust
and
undismayed
and
competent
gave
him
a
sort
of
comfort
dorothy
did
not
agree
with
michael
there
was
more
in
it
than
the
professor
imagination
the
professor
she
said
had
got
any
imagination
you
could
tell
from
the
way
he
lectured
but
she
did
not
believe
one
word
of
the
charge
against
her
brother
something
had
happened
and
nicky
was
screening
somebody
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
said
dorothy
it
wife
she
made
him
give
his
word
dorothy
was
sure
that
booster
wife
was
a
bad
lot
nicky
said
she
was
awfully
decent
he
to
he
could
do
it
by
halves
they
could
have
sent
him
down
unless
they
sifted
the
thing
to
the
bottom
i
daresay
they
sifted
all
they
could
the
silly
asses
she
could
have
killed
them
for
making
her
father
suffer
the
sight
of
his
drawn
face
hurt
her
abominably
she
had
never
seen
him
like
that
she
was
half
so
sorry
for
her
mother
who
was
sustained
by
a
secret
ineradicable
faith
in
nicky
why
could
he
have
faith
in
nicky
too
was
it
because
he
was
a
man
and
knew
that
these
things
happened
daddy
being
sent
down
is
such
an
awful
calamity
it
is
going
to
blast
his
career
or
anything
it
always
touch
and
go
might
have
been
sent
down
any
day
i
should
have
been
if
they
known
about
me
half
what
they
do
know
about
nicky
why
ca
you
take
it
as
a
rag
you
bet
does
anthony
removed
himself
from
her
protecting
hand
he
got
up
and
went
to
bed
but
he
did
not
sleep
there
neither
he
nor
frances
slept
and
he
came
down
in
the
morning
looking
worse
than
ever
dorothy
thought
it
must
be
awful
to
have
children
if
it
makes
you
feel
like
that
she
thought
it
a
lucky
thing
they
not
likely
to
cut
up
the
same
way
about
me
she
thought
again
it
must
be
awful
to
have
children
she
thought
of
the
old
discussions
in
her
room
at
newnham
about
the
woman
right
to
the
child
and
free
union
and
easy
divorce
and
the
abolition
of
the
family
her
own
violent
and
revolutionary
speeches
for
which
she
liked
to
think
she
might
have
been
sent
down
sounded
faint
and
and
irrelevant
she
did
not
really
want
to
abolish
frances
and
anthony
and
yet
if
they
had
been
abolished
as
part
of
the
deplorable
institution
of
parentage
it
would
have
been
better
for
them
for
then
they
would
not
be
suffering
as
they
did
it
must
be
awful
to
have
children
but
perhaps
they
knew
that
it
was
worth
it
and
as
her
thoughts
travelled
that
way
they
were
overtaken
all
of
a
sudden
by
an
idea
she
did
not
stop
to
ask
herself
what
business
her
idea
had
in
that
neighbourhood
she
went
down
first
thing
after
breakfast
and
sent
off
two
wires
one
to
captain
drayton
at
croft
house
eltham
one
to
the
same
person
at
the
royal
military
academy
woolwich
can
i
see
you
it
about
nicky
dorothy
harrison
wires
to
show
that
she
was
impersonal
and
businesslike
and
that
her
business
was
urgent
can
i
see
you
to
show
that
he
was
not
being
invited
to
see
it
about
nicky
to
justify
the
whole
proceeding
dorothy
harrison
because
dorothy
by
itself
was
too
much
as
soon
as
she
had
sent
off
her
wires
dorothy
felt
a
sense
of
happiness
and
she
had
no
grounds
for
happiness
far
otherwise
her
great
friendship
with
rosalind
jervis
was
disintegrating
bit
by
bit
owing
to
rosalind
behaviour
the
fiery
suffrage
meeting
had
turned
into
dust
and
ashes
her
darling
nicky
was
in
a
nasty
scrape
her
father
and
mother
were
utterly
miserable
yet
she
was
happy
home
her
mind
began
to
ask
questions
of
its
own
accord
supposing
you
had
to
choose
between
the
suffrage
and
frank
drayton
but
i
have
got
to
you
might
have
you
know
you
might
any
minute
you
know
he
hates
it
and
supposing
but
dorothy
refused
to
give
any
answer
his
wire
came
within
the
next
half
hour
coming
three
sharp
frank
her
sense
of
increased
almost
to
exaltation
he
arrived
with
punctuality
at
three
he
was
in
the
gunners
and
had
a
job
at
woolwich
she
found
him
standing
on
the
in
the
he
had
blown
his
nose
when
he
heard
her
coming
and
that
meant
that
he
was
nervous
she
caught
him
stuffing
his
a
piece
of
damning
evidence
into
his
with
her
knowledge
of
his
nervousness
her
exaltation
ceased
as
if
it
had
not
been
at
the
sight
of
him
it
was
as
if
the
sentence
hidden
somewhere
in
her
mind
you
have
to
choose
you
know
you
have
to
escaping
thought
and
language
had
expressed
itself
in
one
suffocating
pang
unless
nicky
affair
staved
off
the
dreadful
moment
were
you
frightfully
busy
no
thank
goodness
the
luck
she
had
had
of
course
if
he
had
been
busy
he
possibly
have
come
she
could
look
at
him
now
without
a
tightening
in
her
throat
she
liked
to
look
at
him
he
was
made
all
of
one
piece
she
liked
his
square
face
and
short
fine
hair
both
the
colour
of
earth
his
eyes
the
colour
of
light
brown
earth
under
clear
water
eyes
that
looked
small
because
they
were
set
so
deep
she
liked
their
sudden
narrowing
and
their
deep
wrinkles
when
he
smiled
she
liked
his
jutting
chin
and
the
fine
rather
small
mouth
that
jerked
his
face
slightly
crooked
when
he
laughed
she
liked
that
slender
crookedness
that
made
it
a
face
remarkable
and
unique
among
faces
she
liked
his
brains
she
liked
all
that
she
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
him
vera
had
told
them
that
once
at
an
station
in
india
he
had
stopped
a
mutiny
in
a
native
battery
by
laughing
in
the
men
faces
somebody
that
ferdie
knew
had
been
with
him
and
saw
it
happen
the
men
broke
into
his
office
where
he
was
sitting
vulnerably
in
his
they
had
brought
knives
with
them
beastly
native
things
and
they
had
their
hands
on
the
handles
ready
they
screamed
and
gesticulated
with
excitement
and
frank
drayton
leaned
back
in
his
office
chair
and
looked
at
them
and
burst
out
laughing
because
he
said
they
made
such
funny
faces
when
they
got
to
fingering
their
knives
he
tilted
back
his
chair
and
rocked
with
laughter
his
sudden
incredible
mirth
frightened
them
and
stopped
the
mutiny
she
could
see
him
she
could
see
his
face
jerked
crooked
with
delight
that
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
nicky
would
have
done
she
loved
him
for
that
she
loved
him
because
he
was
like
nicky
she
was
not
able
to
recall
the
process
of
the
states
that
flowered
in
that
mysterious
sense
of
and
exaltation
a
year
ago
frank
drayton
had
been
only
that
nice
man
we
used
to
meet
at
cheltenham
first
of
all
he
had
been
ferdie
and
vera
friend
then
he
became
nicky
friend
the
only
one
who
took
a
serious
interest
in
his
inventions
and
supported
him
when
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
army
and
consoled
him
when
he
was
frustrated
then
he
had
become
the
friend
of
the
family
now
he
was
recognized
as
more
particularly
friend
at
cheltenham
he
had
been
home
on
leave
and
it
was
not
until
this
year
that
he
had
got
his
job
at
woolwich
teaching
gunnery
while
he
waited
for
a
bigger
job
in
the
ordnance
department
ferdie
cameron
had
always
said
that
frank
drayton
would
be
worth
watching
he
would
be
part
of
the
brains
of
the
army
some
day
nicky
watched
him
his
brains
and
their
familiarity
with
explosives
and
the
machinery
of
warfare
had
been
his
original
attraction
for
nicky
but
it
was
dorothea
who
watched
him
most
she
plunged
abruptly
into
nicky
affair
giving
names
and
lineage
you
know
all
sorts
of
people
do
you
know
anything
about
her
he
looked
at
her
clearly
without
smiling
then
he
said
yes
i
know
a
good
bit
about
her
is
that
what
wrong
with
nicky
not
exactly
but
he
been
sent
down
his
wry
smile
intimated
that
such
things
might
be
then
she
told
him
what
the
master
had
written
and
what
the
professor
had
written
and
what
michael
had
written
and
what
nicky
had
said
and
what
she
dorothea
thought
drayton
smiled
over
the
master
and
the
professor
letters
but
when
it
came
to
michael
letter
he
laughed
aloud
it
all
very
well
for
but
daddy
and
mummy
are
breaking
their
hearts
daddy
says
he
going
down
to
cambridge
to
see
what
really
did
happen
again
that
clear
look
she
gathered
that
he
disapproved
of
booster
wife
he
disapproved
of
so
many
things
of
women
suffrage
of
revolutions
of
women
who
revolted
of
anybody
who
revolted
of
and
blathwaite
and
angela
blathwaite
it
was
putting
it
too
mildly
to
say
he
disapproved
of
rosalind
jervis
he
detested
her
he
disapproved
of
vera
and
of
her
going
to
see
vera
she
remembered
that
he
had
even
disapproved
long
ago
of
poor
ferdie
though
he
liked
him
evidently
he
disapproved
of
booster
wife
for
the
same
reason
that
he
disapproved
of
vera
that
was
why
he
say
so
i
believe
you
think
all
the
time
i
right
she
said
would
you
go
down
if
you
were
he
no
i
would
why
not
because
he
wo
get
anything
out
of
them
they
ca
give
her
away
any
more
than
nicky
can
or
than
can
dorothy
you
mean
i
done
it
already
to
you
i
to
because
of
nicky
i
ca
help
it
if
you
think
it
was
beastly
of
me
my
dear
child
he
got
up
vehemently
as
if
his
idea
was
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
stifle
her
outbreak
that
way
but
something
in
her
eyes
cold
unready
yet
aware
of
him
repelled
him
he
thought
it
too
soon
she
all
rigid
she
is
alive
yet
that
not
what
she
wired
for
he
thought
i
wish
people
would
send
their
children
to
newnham
it
retards
their
development
by
ten
years
and
she
thought
no
i
must
let
him
do
that
for
then
he
wo
be
able
to
go
back
on
me
when
i
tell
him
my
opinions
it
would
be
simply
trapping
him
supposing
supposing
she
did
not
know
that
that
instinctive
renunciation
was
her
answer
to
the
question
her
honour
would
come
first
of
course
of
course
you
had
to
what
would
you
do
about
it
if
you
were
daddy
i
should
send
them
all
to
blazes
no
but
do
i
should
do
nothing
i
should
leave
it
you
find
that
before
very
long
there
be
letters
of
apology
and
restitution
will
you
come
down
to
the
office
with
me
and
tell
daddy
that
yes
if
you
come
to
tea
with
me
somewhere
afterwards
he
really
could
be
expected
to
do
all
this
for
nothing
she
sent
her
mother
to
him
while
she
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
when
she
came
down
frances
was
happy
again
you
see
mummy
i
was
right
after
all
you
always
were
right
darling
all
the
time
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
help
giving
that
little
flick
at
her
infallible
daughter
she
right
most
of
the
time
said
drayton
his
eyes
covered
and
protected
her
anthony
was
in
his
office
sitting
before
the
open
doors
of
the
cabinet
where
he
kept
his
samples
of
rare
and
valuable
woods
the
polished
slabs
were
laid
before
him
on
the
table
in
rows
as
he
had
arranged
them
to
show
to
a
customer
mahogany
and
golden
satinwood
ebony
black
as
jet
mottled
like
fine
tortoiseshell
coromandel
wood
striped
black
and
white
like
the
coat
of
a
civet
cat
ghostly
basswood
shining
white
on
dead
white
woods
of
clouded
grain
and
woods
of
shining
grain
grain
that
showed
like
the
slanting
splintered
lines
of
hewn
stone
like
moss
like
the
veins
of
flowers
the
fringes
of
birds
feathers
the
striping
and
dappling
of
beasts
woods
of
exquisite
grain
where
the
life
of
the
tree
drew
its
own
image
in
its
own
heart
woods
whose
surface
was
tender
to
the
touch
like
a
fine
tissue
and
sandalwood
and
and
cedar
anthony
loved
his
shining
polished
slabs
of
wood
if
a
man
must
have
a
business
let
it
be
timber
timber
was
a
clean
and
fine
and
noble
thing
he
had
brought
the
working
of
his
business
to
such
a
pitch
of
smooth
perfection
that
his
two
elder
sons
michael
and
nicholas
could
catch
up
with
it
easily
and
take
it
in
their
stride
now
he
was
like
a
sick
child
that
has
ranged
all
its
toys
in
front
of
it
and
finds
no
comfort
in
them
and
as
he
looked
at
them
the
and
the
scented
sandalwood
and
gave
him
an
idea
the
master
and
the
professor
had
both
advised
him
to
send
his
son
nicholas
out
of
england
for
a
little
while
let
him
travel
for
six
months
and
get
the
whole
miserable
business
out
of
his
head
nicky
when
he
gave
up
the
army
had
told
him
flatly
that
he
would
rather
die
than
spend
his
life
sitting
in
a
beastly
office
nicky
had
put
it
to
him
that
timber
meant
trees
and
trees
meant
forests
why
lots
of
the
stuff
they
imported
came
from
the
himalaya
and
the
west
indies
and
ceylon
he
had
reminded
him
that
he
was
always
saying
a
timber
merchant
could
know
enough
about
the
living
tree
why
should
he
go
into
the
places
where
the
living
trees
grew
and
learn
all
about
them
why
should
he
be
a
since
they
were
specializing
in
rare
and
foreign
woods
why
should
he
specialize
in
rare
and
foreign
trees
and
the
slabs
of
and
scented
and
sandalwood
were
saying
to
anthony
why
not
neither
he
nor
frances
had
wanted
nicky
to
go
off
to
the
west
indies
and
the
himalaya
but
now
since
clearly
he
must
go
off
somewhere
why
not
drayton
and
dorothy
came
in
just
as
anthony
still
profoundly
dejected
was
saying
to
himself
reinstate
him
give
him
responsibility
curiosity
healthy
interests
get
the
whole
miserable
business
out
of
his
head
it
seemed
incredible
after
what
they
had
gone
through
that
drayton
should
be
standing
there
telling
him
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
that
there
never
had
been
any
miserable
business
that
it
was
all
a
storm
in
a
hysterical
woman
teacup
he
blew
the
whole
dirty
nightmare
to
nothing
with
the
laughter
that
was
like
nicky
own
laughter
then
anthony
and
drayton
and
dorothy
sat
round
the
table
drafting
letters
to
the
master
and
the
professor
anthony
at
dictation
informed
them
that
he
regretted
the
step
they
had
seen
fit
to
take
that
he
knew
his
own
son
well
enough
to
be
pretty
certain
that
there
had
been
some
misunderstanding
therefore
unless
he
received
within
three
days
a
written
withdrawal
of
the
charge
against
his
son
nicholas
he
would
be
obliged
to
remove
his
son
michael
from
the
master
college
the
idea
of
removing
michael
was
anthony
own
inspiration
drayton
advice
was
that
he
should
give
nicky
his
choice
between
oxford
and
germany
the
big
school
of
forestry
at
aschaffenburg
if
he
chose
germany
he
would
be
well
grounded
he
could
specialize
and
travel
afterwards
now
all
over
anthony
said
you
two
had
better
come
and
have
tea
with
me
somewhere
but
there
was
something
in
their
faces
that
made
him
consult
his
watch
and
find
that
oh
dear
me
no
he
was
afraid
he
could
he
had
an
appointment
at
five
when
they
were
well
out
of
sight
he
locked
up
his
toys
in
his
cabinet
left
the
appointment
at
five
to
vereker
and
went
home
to
tell
frances
about
the
letters
he
had
written
to
cambridge
and
the
plans
that
had
been
made
for
nicky
future
he
choose
germany
anthony
said
but
that
ca
be
helped
frances
agreed
that
they
could
hardly
have
hit
upon
a
better
plan
so
the
affair
of
nicky
and
booster
wife
was
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
for
that
they
thanked
the
blessed
common
sense
and
sanity
of
captain
drayton
and
yet
anthony
idea
was
wrecked
by
booster
wife
it
had
come
too
late
anthony
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
his
son
had
seventeen
start
of
him
he
was
unaware
of
the
existence
of
nicky
own
idea
and
he
had
not
allowed
for
the
stiff
logic
of
his
position
when
he
drove
down
in
his
car
to
john
wood
to
fetch
nicky
he
found
that
he
had
left
that
afternoon
for
chelsea
where
vera
told
him
he
had
taken
rooms
she
gave
him
the
address
it
had
no
significance
for
anthony
nicky
refused
to
be
fetched
back
from
his
rooms
in
chelsea
for
he
had
not
left
his
father
house
in
a
huff
he
had
left
it
in
his
wisdom
to
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
an
incredible
position
his
position
as
he
pointed
out
to
his
father
had
not
changed
he
was
as
big
a
blackguard
as
he
was
yesterday
the
only
difference
was
that
or
the
next
day
he
would
be
a
blackguard
he
would
listen
to
his
father
plan
it
was
a
beautiful
plan
but
it
would
only
mean
spending
more
money
on
him
he
be
pretty
good
he
thought
at
looking
after
machinery
he
was
going
to
try
for
a
job
as
a
chauffeur
or
foreman
mechanic
he
thought
he
knew
where
he
could
get
one
but
supposing
he
could
get
it
if
his
father
cared
to
take
him
on
at
the
works
for
a
bit
he
come
like
a
shot
but
he
could
stay
there
because
it
would
be
good
enough
he
was
absolutely
serious
and
absolutely
firm
in
the
logic
of
his
position
for
he
argued
that
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
back
as
though
nothing
had
happened
this
more
than
anything
he
could
well
think
of
would
be
giving
peggy
away
he
sent
his
love
to
his
mother
and
dorothy
and
promised
to
come
out
and
dine
with
them
as
soon
as
he
had
got
his
job
so
anthony
drove
back
without
him
but
as
he
drove
he
smiled
and
frances
smiled
too
when
he
told
her
there
he
is
the
young
monkey
and
there
he
stay
it
magnificent
but
of
course
he
an
ass
if
you
ca
be
an
ass
at
twenty
said
frances
when
can
you
be
they
said
it
was
so
like
nicky
for
all
he
knew
to
the
contrary
his
career
was
ruined
but
he
did
care
you
could
make
any
impression
on
him
they
wondered
if
anybody
ever
would
dorothy
wondered
too
what
sort
of
rooms
has
he
got
anthony
said
frances
very
nice
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
looking
over
the
river
darling
nicky
i
shall
go
and
see
him
what
are
you
thinking
of
dorothy
dorothy
was
thinking
that
nicky
address
at
chelsea
was
the
address
that
desmond
had
given
her
yesterday
xiii
when
frances
heard
that
nicholas
was
going
about
everywhere
with
the
painter
girl
they
called
desmond
she
wrote
to
vera
to
come
and
see
her
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
go
to
the
john
wood
house
that
was
so
much
more
lawrence
stephen
house
than
it
was
vera
the
three
eldest
children
went
now
and
then
refusing
to
go
back
on
vera
frances
did
not
like
it
but
she
had
not
interfered
with
their
liberty
so
far
as
to
forbid
it
positively
for
she
judged
that
frustration
might
create
an
appetite
for
stephen
society
that
otherwise
they
might
not
after
all
acquire
vera
understood
that
her
husband
brother
and
could
hardly
be
expected
to
condone
her
last
aberration
her
attachment
to
ferdie
cameron
had
been
different
it
was
inevitable
and
in
a
sense
forgivable
seeing
that
it
had
been
brought
about
by
bartie
sheer
impossibility
besides
the
knowledge
of
it
had
dawned
on
them
so
gradually
and
through
so
many
stages
of
extenuating
tragedy
that
even
when
it
became
an
open
certainty
the
benefit
of
the
long
doubt
remained
and
there
was
veronica
there
was
still
veronica
even
without
veronica
vera
would
have
had
to
think
of
something
far
worse
than
lawrence
stephen
before
frances
would
have
cast
her
off
frances
felt
that
it
was
not
for
her
to
sit
in
judgment
under
the
shelter
of
her
tree
of
heaven
supposing
she
could
only
have
had
anthony
as
vera
had
had
ferdie
could
she
have
lived
without
him
for
frances
nothing
in
the
world
had
any
use
or
interest
or
significance
but
her
husband
and
her
children
her
children
first
and
anthony
after
them
for
vera
nothing
in
the
world
counted
but
her
lover
if
only
i
were
as
sure
of
lawrence
as
you
are
of
anthony
she
would
say
yet
she
lived
the
more
intensely
if
the
more
dangerously
through
the
very
risks
of
her
exposed
and
forbidden
love
vera
was
without
fidelity
to
the
unreturning
dead
but
she
made
up
for
it
by
an
incorruptible
adoration
of
the
living
and
she
had
been
made
notorious
chiefly
through
stephen
celebrity
which
was
you
might
say
a
pure
accident
thus
frances
made
shelter
for
her
friend
only
vera
must
be
made
to
understand
that
though
was
accepted
lawrence
stephen
was
not
he
was
the
point
at
which
toleration
ceased
and
vera
did
understand
she
understood
that
frances
and
anthony
disapproved
of
her
last
adventure
considerably
more
on
ferdie
and
veronica
account
than
on
bartie
even
family
loyalty
could
not
espouse
bartie
cause
with
any
zest
for
bartie
showed
himself
implacable
over
and
over
again
she
had
implored
him
to
divorce
her
so
that
lawrence
might
marry
her
and
over
and
over
again
he
had
refused
his
idea
was
to
assert
himself
by
refusals
in
that
way
he
could
still
feel
that
he
had
power
over
her
and
a
sort
of
possession
it
was
he
who
was
scandalous
even
now
neither
frances
nor
anthony
had
a
word
to
say
for
him
so
vera
consented
to
be
received
surreptitiously
by
herself
and
without
receiving
frances
and
anthony
in
her
turn
it
had
hurt
her
but
stephen
celebrity
was
a
dressing
to
her
wound
he
was
so
distinguished
that
it
was
unlikely
that
frances
or
anthony
either
would
ever
have
been
received
by
him
without
vera
she
came
looking
half
cynical
half
pathetic
her
beauty
a
little
blurred
a
little
beaten
after
seventeen
years
of
passion
and
danger
saying
that
she
was
going
to
force
larry
down
their
throats
if
they
did
like
him
and
she
went
away
sustained
by
her
sense
of
his
distinction
and
repudiations
and
she
found
further
support
in
her
knowledge
that
if
frances
and
anthony
could
resist
lawrence
their
children
could
michael
and
dorothy
were
acquiring
a
taste
for
him
and
for
the
people
he
knew
and
he
knew
almost
everybody
who
was
worth
knowing
to
be
seen
at
the
parties
he
and
vera
gave
in
john
wood
was
itself
distinction
vera
had
never
forgotten
and
never
would
forget
what
anthony
and
frances
had
done
for
her
and
ferdie
when
they
took
veronica
she
wanted
to
make
up
to
pay
back
to
help
their
children
as
they
had
helped
her
child
to
give
the
best
she
had
and
do
what
they
poor
darlings
possibly
have
done
nicholas
was
all
right
but
michael
case
was
lamentable
in
his
family
and
in
the
dull
round
of
their
acquaintance
there
was
not
anybody
who
was
likely
to
be
of
the
least
use
to
michael
not
anybody
that
he
cared
to
know
no
wonder
that
he
kept
up
his
old
attitude
of
refusing
to
go
to
the
party
lawrence
stephen
had
promised
her
that
he
would
help
michael
and
frances
was
afraid
she
saw
her
children
michael
nicholas
and
dorothy
swept
every
day
a
little
farther
from
the
firm
sanctities
a
little
nearer
to
the
unclean
moral
vortex
that
to
her
was
the
most
redoubtable
of
all
she
hid
her
fear
because
in
her
wisdom
she
knew
that
to
show
fear
was
not
the
way
to
keep
her
children
she
hid
her
strength
because
she
knew
that
to
show
it
was
not
the
way
her
strength
was
in
their
love
of
her
she
had
only
used
it
once
when
she
had
stopped
nicky
from
going
into
the
army
she
had
said
to
herself
then
i
will
never
do
that
again
it
was
fair
it
was
a
sort
of
sacrilege
a
treachery
love
was
holy
it
should
never
be
used
never
be
bargained
with
she
tried
to
hold
the
balance
even
between
their
youth
and
their
maturity
so
frances
fought
her
fear
she
had
known
that
ferdie
cameron
was
good
as
she
put
it
in
spite
of
everything
but
she
had
not
seen
lawrence
stephen
and
she
did
not
know
that
he
had
sensibilities
and
prejudices
and
scruples
like
her
own
and
that
he
and
vera
distinguished
very
carefully
between
the
people
who
would
be
good
for
michael
and
nicholas
and
dorothy
and
the
people
who
would
not
she
did
not
know
that
they
both
drew
the
line
at
desmond
vera
protested
that
it
was
not
her
fault
it
was
not
lawrence
fault
that
nicky
had
met
desmond
she
had
never
asked
them
to
meet
each
other
she
did
not
deny
that
it
was
in
her
house
they
met
but
she
had
not
introduced
them
desmond
had
introduced
herself
on
the
grounds
that
she
knew
dorothy
vera
suspected
that
from
the
first
moment
when
she
had
seen
him
there
by
pure
accident
she
had
marked
him
down
very
likely
she
had
wriggled
into
dorothy
suffrage
meeting
on
purpose
she
was
capable
of
anything
not
that
vera
thought
there
was
any
need
for
frances
to
worry
it
was
most
unlikely
that
desmond
business
with
nicky
could
be
serious
for
one
thing
she
was
too
young
herself
to
care
for
anybody
as
young
as
nicky
for
another
she
happened
to
be
in
the
beginning
or
the
middle
certainly
nowhere
near
the
end
of
a
tremendous
affair
with
headley
richards
as
she
was
designing
the
dresses
and
the
scenery
for
the
new
play
he
was
putting
on
at
the
independent
theatre
vera
argued
very
plausibly
that
the
affair
had
only
just
started
and
that
frances
must
allow
it
a
certain
time
to
run
i
hope
to
goodness
that
the
richards
man
will
marry
her
my
dear
how
can
he
he
married
already
to
a
nice
little
woman
that
he
is
half
tired
of
yet
desmond
was
determined
to
have
him
and
got
him
but
he
only
taken
her
in
his
stride
as
you
may
say
i
suppose
he
cares
very
much
one
way
or
another
but
with
desmond
it
a
point
of
honour
what
a
point
of
honour
why
to
have
him
not
to
be
left
out
besides
she
always
said
she
could
take
him
from
poor
little
ginny
richards
and
she
done
it
that
was
another
point
of
honour
with
a
calmness
that
was
horrible
to
frances
vera
weighed
her
friend
desmond
case
to
frances
it
was
as
if
she
had
never
known
vera
either
vera
had
changed
or
she
had
never
known
her
she
had
never
known
women
or
men
either
who
discussed
such
performances
with
calmness
vera
herself
had
made
her
infidelities
a
point
of
honour
these
were
the
passions
and
the
thoughts
of
lawrence
stephen
and
of
desmond
world
these
were
the
things
it
took
for
granted
these
people
lived
in
a
moral
vortex
they
whirled
round
and
round
with
each
other
they
were
powerless
to
resist
the
swirl
not
one
of
them
had
any
other
care
than
to
love
and
to
make
love
after
the
manner
of
the
vortex
this
was
their
honour
not
to
be
left
out
of
it
not
to
be
left
out
of
the
vortex
but
to
be
carried
away
to
be
sucked
in
and
whirl
round
and
round
with
each
other
and
the
rest
the
painter
girl
desmond
was
horrible
to
frances
and
all
the
time
her
mind
was
busy
with
one
question
do
you
think
nicky
knows
i
perfectly
sure
he
does
perhaps
if
he
did
no
my
dear
that
no
good
if
you
tell
him
he
wo
believe
it
you
have
all
his
chivalry
up
in
arms
and
you
be
putting
into
his
head
what
may
never
come
into
it
if
he
left
alone
and
you
be
putting
it
into
desmond
head
captain
drayton
whom
anthony
consulted
said
leave
him
alone
those
painting
and
writing
johnnies
were
a
rum
lot
you
could
take
them
seriously
the
desmond
girl
might
be
everything
that
vera
harrison
said
she
was
he
did
think
though
that
the
idea
of
making
love
to
her
would
enter
nicky
head
if
they
left
him
alone
nicky
head
had
more
important
ideas
in
it
so
they
left
him
alone
and
at
first
nicholas
really
was
too
busy
to
think
much
of
desmond
too
busy
with
his
assistant
manager
job
at
the
morss
motor
works
too
busy
with
one
of
the
little
ideas
to
which
he
owed
the
sudden
rise
in
his
position
the
little
idea
of
making
the
morss
cars
go
faster
too
busy
with
his
big
idea
which
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
morss
company
and
their
cars
his
big
idea
was
the
idea
of
the
moving
fortress
the
dream
of
a
french
engineer
the
old
abandoned
dream
of
the
had
become
nicky
passion
he
claimed
no
originality
for
his
idea
it
was
a
composite
of
the
amoured
train
the
revolving
turret
the
tractor
with
caterpillar
wheels
and
the
these
things
had
welded
themselves
together
gradually
in
nicky
mind
during
his
last
year
at
cambridge
the
table
in
nicky
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
chelsea
was
now
covered
with
the
parts
of
his
model
of
the
moving
fortress
he
made
them
at
the
works
one
by
one
for
the
morss
company
were
proud
of
him
and
he
had
leave
to
use
their
material
and
plant
now
and
then
for
little
ideas
of
his
own
the
idea
of
the
moving
fortress
was
with
him
all
day
in
the
workshops
and
offices
and
showrooms
hovering
like
a
formless
spiritual
presence
among
the
wheeled
forms
but
in
the
evening
it
took
shape
and
sound
it
arose
and
moved
after
its
fashion
as
he
had
conceived
it
beautiful
monstrous
terrible
at
night
beside
the
image
of
the
the
image
of
desmond
was
a
thin
ghost
that
stood
back
mournful
and
dumb
in
the
corner
of
the
vision
but
the
image
of
desmond
was
there
at
first
it
stood
for
nicky
predominant
anxiety
i
wonder
when
desmond
will
have
finished
the
drawings
the
model
of
the
moving
fortress
waited
upon
desmond
caprice
the
plans
of
the
parts
and
sections
had
to
be
finished
before
these
could
be
fitted
together
and
the
permanent
model
of
the
moving
fortress
set
up
the
moving
fortress
itself
waited
upon
desmond
for
though
nicky
could
make
and
build
his
engine
he
could
not
draw
his
plans
properly
and
he
could
not
trust
anybody
who
understood
engines
to
draw
them
he
was
haunted
almost
insanely
by
the
fear
that
somebody
else
would
hit
upon
the
idea
of
the
moving
fortress
it
seemed
to
him
so
obvious
that
no
gunner
and
no
engineer
could
miss
it
and
the
drawings
desmond
made
for
him
the
drawings
in
black
and
white
the
drawings
in
grey
wash
and
the
coloured
drawings
were
perfect
nicky
unskilled
in
everything
but
the
inventing
and
building
up
of
engines
did
not
know
how
perfect
the
drawings
were
any
more
than
he
knew
the
value
of
the
extraordinary
pictures
that
hung
on
the
walls
and
stood
on
the
easels
in
her
studio
but
he
did
know
that
from
the
moment
when
he
took
desmond
into
his
adventure
he
and
his
idea
were
dependent
on
her
he
did
care
he
liked
desmond
he
could
help
it
if
drayton
disapproved
of
her
and
if
dorothy
did
like
her
she
was
he
said
to
himself
a
ripping
good
sort
she
might
be
frightfully
clever
nicky
rather
thought
she
was
but
she
never
let
you
feel
it
she
never
talked
that
revolting
rot
that
rosalind
and
dorothy
other
friends
talked
she
let
you
think
it
was
desmond
who
told
him
that
his
sister
did
like
her
and
that
frank
drayton
disapproved
of
her
they
would
said
nicky
if
they
knew
you
and
he
turned
again
to
the
subject
of
his
moving
fortress
for
desmond
intelligence
was
perfect
and
her
sympathy
was
perfect
and
her
way
of
listening
was
perfect
she
sat
on
the
floor
on
the
orange
and
blue
cushions
in
silence
and
in
patience
embracing
her
knees
with
her
long
slender
arms
while
nicky
stamped
up
and
down
her
studio
and
talked
to
her
like
a
monomaniac
about
his
moving
fortress
it
did
bore
her
to
listen
because
she
did
have
to
answer
she
had
only
to
look
at
him
and
smile
and
nod
her
head
at
him
now
and
then
as
a
sign
of
enthusiasm
she
liked
looking
at
him
she
liked
his
young
naïveté
and
monomania
she
liked
his
face
and
all
his
gestures
and
the
poise
and
movement
of
his
young
body
and
as
she
looked
at
him
the
beauty
that
slept
in
her
dulled
eyes
and
in
her
face
and
in
her
thin
body
awoke
and
became
alive
it
was
not
dangerous
yet
not
ready
yet
to
tell
the
secret
held
back
in
its
long
subtle
serious
and
slender
lines
desmond
sensuality
was
woven
with
so
fine
a
web
that
you
would
have
said
it
belonged
less
to
her
body
than
to
her
spirit
and
her
mind
in
on
fine
days
in
the
late
spring
and
early
summer
when
the
morss
company
lent
him
a
car
or
when
they
sent
him
motoring
about
the
country
on
their
business
he
took
desmond
with
him
and
desmond
painting
box
and
easel
and
they
rested
on
the
grass
borders
of
the
high
roads
and
on
the
edges
of
the
woods
and
moors
and
desmond
painted
her
extraordinary
pictures
while
nicky
lay
on
his
back
beside
her
with
his
face
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
dreamed
of
flying
machines
for
he
had
done
with
his
moving
fortress
it
only
waited
for
desmond
to
finish
the
last
drawing
when
he
had
that
he
would
show
the
plans
and
the
model
to
frank
drayton
before
he
sent
them
to
the
war
office
he
lived
for
that
moment
of
completion
and
from
the
autumn
of
to
the
spring
of
desmond
affair
with
headley
richards
increased
and
flowered
and
ripened
to
its
fulfilment
and
in
the
early
summer
she
found
that
things
had
happened
as
she
had
meant
that
they
should
happen
she
had
always
meant
it
she
had
always
said
and
she
had
always
thought
that
women
were
no
good
unless
they
had
the
courage
of
their
opinions
the
only
thing
to
be
ashamed
of
was
the
cowardice
that
prevented
them
from
getting
what
they
wanted
desmond
had
no
idea
that
the
violence
of
the
vortex
had
sucked
her
in
being
in
the
movement
of
her
own
free
will
she
thought
that
by
simply
spinning
round
faster
and
faster
she
added
her
own
energy
to
the
whirl
it
was
not
dorothy
vortex
or
the
vortex
of
the
fighting
suffrage
woman
desmond
did
care
very
much
about
the
suffrage
or
about
any
kind
of
freedom
but
her
own
kind
or
about
anybody
freedom
but
her
own
maud
blackadder
idea
of
freedom
struck
desmond
as
sheer
moral
and
physical
insanity
yet
each
desmond
and
dorothy
and
maud
blackadder
and
blathwaite
and
her
daughter
and
had
her
own
particular
swirl
in
the
immense
vortex
of
the
young
century
if
you
had
youth
and
life
in
you
you
were
in
revolt
desmond
theories
were
dorothy
theories
too
only
that
while
dorothy
as
rosalind
had
said
thought
out
her
theories
in
her
brain
without
feeling
them
desmond
felt
them
with
her
whole
being
and
with
her
whole
being
secret
subtle
and
absolutely
relentless
she
was
bent
on
carrying
them
out
and
in
the
summer
in
the
new
season
headley
richards
decided
that
he
had
no
further
use
for
desmond
the
new
play
had
run
its
course
at
the
independent
theatre
a
course
so
brief
that
richards
had
been
disappointed
he
put
down
the
failure
mainly
to
the
queerness
of
the
dresses
and
the
scenery
she
had
designed
for
him
desmond
new
art
was
too
new
people
were
ready
yet
for
that
sort
of
thing
at
the
same
time
he
discovered
that
he
was
really
very
much
attached
to
his
own
wife
ginny
and
when
ginny
nobly
offered
to
give
him
his
divorce
he
had
replied
nobly
that
he
did
want
one
and
he
left
desmond
to
face
the
music
desmond
misery
was
acute
but
it
was
not
so
hopeless
as
it
would
have
been
if
she
could
have
credited
ginny
richards
with
any
permanent
power
of
attraction
for
headley
she
knew
he
would
come
back
to
her
she
knew
the
power
of
her
own
body
she
held
him
by
the
tie
that
was
never
broken
so
long
as
it
endured
he
would
never
marry
her
yet
he
would
come
back
but
in
the
interval
between
these
acts
there
was
the
music
and
the
first
sound
of
the
music
the
changed
intonations
of
her
landlady
frightened
desmond
for
though
she
was
older
than
nicky
she
was
very
young
and
there
were
desmond
people
you
may
forget
that
you
have
people
and
behave
as
if
they
were
there
but
if
they
are
there
sooner
or
later
they
will
let
you
know
it
an
immense
volume
of
sound
and
some
terrifying
orchestral
effects
were
contributed
by
people
so
that
the
music
was
really
very
bad
to
bear
desmond
could
bear
it
and
in
her
fright
she
thought
of
nicky
she
knew
that
she
had
a
chance
so
long
as
he
was
absorbed
in
the
moving
fortress
but
the
model
was
finished
and
set
up
and
she
was
at
work
on
the
last
drawing
and
no
more
ideas
for
engines
were
coming
into
nicky
head
the
morss
company
and
nicky
himself
were
even
beginning
to
wonder
whether
there
ever
would
be
any
more
then
nicky
thought
of
desmond
and
he
showed
that
he
was
thinking
of
her
by
sitting
still
and
not
talking
when
he
was
with
her
she
did
not
fill
that
emptiness
and
spaciousness
of
nicky
head
but
he
could
get
her
out
of
it
when
vera
noticed
the
silence
of
the
two
she
became
uneasy
and
judged
that
the
time
had
come
for
discreet
intervention
nicky
she
said
is
it
true
that
desmond
been
doing
drawings
for
you
yes
said
nicky
she
done
any
amount
my
dear
boy
have
you
any
idea
of
the
amount
you
have
to
pay
her
i
have
said
nicky
i
wish
i
had
i
hate
asking
her
and
yet
i
suppose
i
have
to
of
course
you
have
to
wo
hate
it
she
got
to
earn
her
living
as
much
as
you
have
has
she
you
do
mean
to
say
she
hard
up
he
had
never
thought
of
desmond
as
earning
her
own
living
still
less
as
being
hard
up
i
only
wish
she
were
said
vera
for
your
sake
why
on
earth
for
my
sake
because
my
dear
nicky
you
would
have
to
pay
so
stiff
a
price
i
do
care
said
nicky
how
stiff
the
price
is
i
shall
pay
it
and
vera
replied
that
desmond
in
her
own
queer
way
really
was
a
rather
distinguished
painter
pay
her
she
said
pay
her
for
goodness
sake
and
have
done
with
it
and
if
she
wants
to
give
you
things
let
her
as
if
said
nicky
i
should
dream
of
letting
her
and
he
went
off
to
chelsea
to
pay
desmond
then
and
there
vera
thought
that
she
had
been
rather
clever
nicky
would
dash
in
and
do
the
thing
badly
he
would
be
very
proud
about
it
and
he
would
revolt
from
his
dependence
on
desmond
and
he
would
show
her
vera
hoped
that
he
would
show
her
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
under
any
obligation
to
her
and
desmond
would
be
hurt
and
lose
her
temper
the
hard
look
would
get
into
her
face
and
destroy
its
beauty
and
she
would
say
detestable
things
in
a
detestable
voice
and
a
dreadful
ugliness
would
come
between
them
and
the
impulse
of
nicky
yet
unborn
passion
would
be
checked
and
the
memory
of
that
abominable
would
divide
them
for
ever
but
vera
herself
had
grown
hard
and
clever
she
had
forgotten
tenderness
and
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
desmond
fright
and
as
it
happened
neither
nicky
nor
desmond
did
any
of
the
things
she
thought
they
would
do
nicky
was
not
impetuous
he
found
desmond
in
her
studio
working
on
the
last
drawing
of
the
moving
fortress
with
the
finished
model
before
her
that
gave
him
his
opening
and
he
approached
shyly
and
tentatively
desmond
put
on
an
air
of
complete
absorption
in
her
drawing
but
she
smiled
a
pretty
smile
that
lifted
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
made
it
quiver
and
gave
nicky
a
queer
and
unexpected
desire
to
kiss
her
he
went
on
wanting
to
know
what
his
debt
was
not
that
he
could
ever
really
pay
it
oh
you
foolish
nicky
desmond
said
he
repeated
himself
over
and
over
again
and
each
time
she
had
an
answer
and
the
answers
had
a
cumulative
effect
there
is
any
debt
you
do
pay
anything
i
did
do
it
for
you
silly
boy
what
did
i
do
it
for
i
did
it
for
fun
you
could
draw
a
thing
like
that
for
anything
else
look
at
it
well
if
you
want
to
be
horrid
and
calculating
about
it
think
of
the
lunches
and
the
dinners
and
the
theatre
tickets
and
the
flowers
given
oh
and
the
gallons
and
gallons
of
petrol
how
am
i
ever
to
pay
you
back
again
thus
she
mocked
him
ca
you
see
how
you
spoiling
it
all
and
then
passionately
oh
nicky
please
do
say
it
again
it
hurts
she
turned
on
him
her
big
black
eyes
washed
bright
each
with
one
tear
that
knew
better
than
to
fall
just
yet
he
must
see
that
she
was
holding
herself
well
in
hand
it
would
be
no
use
letting
herself
go
until
he
had
forgotten
his
moving
fortress
he
was
looking
at
the
beastly
thing
now
instead
of
looking
at
her
are
you
thinking
of
another
old
engine
no
said
nicky
i
not
thinking
of
anything
then
you
do
want
me
to
do
any
more
drawings
no
well
then
i
wonder
whether
you
very
much
mind
going
away
now
no
not
now
but
soon
from
here
altogether
go
altogether
me
why
he
was
utterly
astonished
he
thought
that
he
had
offended
desmond
past
all
forgiveness
because
i
came
here
to
be
alone
to
work
and
i
ca
work
and
i
want
to
be
alone
again
am
i
spoiling
it
yes
you
spoiling
it
damnably
i
sorry
desmond
i
did
mean
to
i
thought
but
he
had
the
heart
to
say
what
he
had
thought
she
looked
at
him
and
knew
that
the
moment
was
coming
it
had
come
she
turned
away
from
the
table
where
the
moving
fortress
stood
threatening
her
with
its
mimic
guns
and
reminding
nicky
of
the
things
she
most
wanted
him
to
forget
she
withdrew
to
her
crouching
place
at
the
other
end
of
the
studio
among
the
cushions
he
followed
her
there
with
slow
thoughtful
steps
steps
full
of
brooding
purpose
and
of
meaning
nicky
i
so
unhappy
i
did
know
it
was
possible
for
anybody
to
be
so
unhappy
in
this
world
she
began
to
cry
quietly
desmond
what
is
it
what
is
it
tell
me
why
ca
you
tell
me
she
thought
it
will
be
all
right
if
he
kisses
me
once
if
he
holds
me
in
his
arms
once
then
i
can
tell
him
for
then
he
would
know
that
he
loved
her
he
was
not
quite
sure
now
she
knew
that
he
was
not
quite
sure
she
trusted
to
the
power
of
her
body
to
make
him
sure
her
youth
neither
understood
his
youth
nor
allowed
for
it
nor
pitied
it
he
had
kissed
her
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
more
than
once
while
she
cried
there
hiding
her
face
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
she
was
weak
and
small
she
was
like
some
small
soft
helpless
animal
and
she
was
hurt
her
sobbing
and
panting
made
her
ribs
feel
fragile
like
the
ribs
of
some
small
soft
helpless
animal
under
the
pressure
of
his
arms
and
she
was
frightened
he
could
stand
the
sight
of
suffering
he
had
never
yet
resisted
the
appeal
of
small
weak
helpless
things
in
fright
and
pain
he
could
feel
desmond
heart
going
thump
thump
under
the
blue
thing
he
called
her
pinafore
her
heart
hurt
him
with
its
thumping
and
through
all
his
painful
pity
he
knew
that
her
skin
was
smooth
and
sweet
like
a
and
desmond
knew
that
he
knew
it
his
mouth
slid
with
an
exquisite
slipperiness
over
the
long
polished
bands
of
her
black
hair
and
he
thought
that
he
loved
her
desmond
knew
that
he
thought
it
and
still
she
waited
she
said
to
herself
it
no
good
his
thinking
it
i
dare
tell
him
till
he
says
it
till
he
asks
me
to
marry
him
he
had
said
it
at
last
and
he
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
then
she
had
told
him
and
all
that
he
said
was
i
do
care
he
said
it
to
desmond
and
he
said
it
to
himself
the
funny
thing
was
that
he
did
not
care
he
was
as
miserable
as
it
was
well
possible
to
be
but
he
did
really
care
he
was
not
even
surprised
it
was
as
if
the
knowledge
of
it
had
been
hiding
in
the
back
of
his
head
behind
all
the
ideas
and
yet
he
could
have
known
it
all
the
time
either
it
must
have
gone
away
when
his
ideas
went
or
he
must
have
been
trying
not
to
see
it
she
had
slipped
from
his
arms
and
stood
before
him
dabbing
her
mouth
and
eyes
now
and
then
with
her
controlling
herself
crying
quietly
she
knew
what
had
not
dawned
on
nicky
yet
that
he
did
love
her
if
he
had
loved
her
he
would
have
cared
intolerably
he
did
care
about
headley
richards
because
he
did
care
about
desmond
any
more
he
was
only
puzzled
why
did
you
do
it
i
ca
think
why
i
must
have
been
off
my
head
i
did
know
what
it
was
like
i
did
know
i
thought
it
would
be
wonderful
and
beautiful
i
thought
he
was
wonderful
and
beautiful
poor
little
desmond
oh
nicky
do
you
think
me
a
beast
does
it
make
you
hate
me
no
of
course
it
does
the
only
awful
thing
is
what
tell
me
well
you
see
you
mean
the
baby
i
know
it
awful
you
need
tell
me
that
nicky
he
stared
at
her
i
mean
it
so
awful
for
she
thought
he
had
been
thinking
of
himself
and
her
why
should
it
be
why
there
is
any
why
it
just
is
i
it
is
he
was
thinking
of
veronica
you
see
he
said
simply
that
why
this
sort
of
thing
is
such
a
rotten
game
it
so
hard
on
the
kiddy
i
suppose
you
did
think
of
that
you
could
have
or
else
you
would
he
paused
there
was
one
thing
he
had
to
know
he
must
get
it
out
of
her
it
has
made
you
feel
that
you
do
want
it
oh
i
do
know
what
i
want
i
do
know
what
it
makes
me
feel
do
let
it
desmond
do
let
it
it
be
all
right
you
wo
feel
like
that
when
you
married
me
ca
you
see
that
the
wonderful
and
beautiful
part
is
she
said
in
her
tired
drawl
the
poor
kiddy
because
he
remembered
veronica
he
was
going
to
marry
desmond
veronica
mother
was
the
first
to
hear
about
it
desmond
told
her
veronica
mother
was
determined
to
stop
it
for
the
sake
of
everybody
concerned
she
wrote
to
nicholas
and
asked
him
to
come
and
dine
with
her
one
evening
when
lawrence
stephen
was
dining
somewhere
else
lawrence
stephen
made
rather
a
point
of
not
going
to
houses
where
vera
was
not
received
but
sometimes
when
the
occasion
was
political
or
otherwise
important
he
had
to
that
was
her
punishment
as
bartholomew
had
meant
that
it
should
be
nicky
knew
what
he
had
been
sent
for
and
to
all
his
aunt
assaults
and
manoeuvres
he
presented
an
inexpugnable
front
you
must
do
it
you
simply
must
he
intimated
that
his
marriage
was
his
own
affair
it
is
it
the
affair
of
everybody
who
cares
for
you
their
caring
is
my
affair
said
nicky
and
then
vera
began
to
say
things
about
desmond
it
absurd
of
you
she
said
to
treat
her
as
if
she
was
an
innocent
child
she
is
a
child
and
she
is
innocent
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
she
was
about
there
nothing
she
does
know
she
meant
it
to
happen
and
she
made
it
happen
she
said
she
would
she
meant
you
to
marry
her
and
she
making
you
marry
her
i
daresay
she
said
she
would
she
as
clever
and
determined
as
the
devil
neither
you
nor
headley
richards
ever
had
a
chance
against
her
she
has
got
a
dog
chance
against
all
you
people
yelping
at
her
now
she
down
i
should
have
thought
you
mean
no
business
to
that
was
different
i
did
take
any
other
woman
husband
or
any
other
woman
lover
nicky
if
you
had
said
nicky
i
would
have
interfered
i
would
interfere
if
i
thought
you
cared
for
desmond
but
you
do
you
know
you
do
of
course
i
care
for
her
he
said
it
stoutly
but
he
coloured
all
the
same
and
vera
knew
that
he
was
vulnerable
oh
nicky
dear
if
you
only
waited
what
do
you
mean
his
young
eyes
interrogated
her
austerely
and
she
flinched
i
know
what
i
mean
unless
i
mean
that
you
just
a
little
young
to
marry
anybody
i
do
care
if
i
am
i
do
young
i
can
tell
you
anyhow
desmond
years
younger
desmond
is
you
twenty
it
veronica
who
years
younger
veronica
she
sixteen
you
do
imagine
desmond
is
as
young
as
that
do
you
wait
till
she
and
you
it
would
do
poor
desmond
much
good
if
i
did
i
could
kill
headley
richards
what
for
for
leaving
her
vera
smiled
that
shows
how
much
you
care
you
would
have
felt
like
killing
him
if
he
stuck
to
her
why
should
you
marry
headley
mistress
and
take
on
his
child
it
preposterous
it
is
if
the
other
fellow
a
brute
it
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
be
i
want
to
be
some
use
in
this
rotten
world
where
people
are
so
damnably
cruel
to
each
other
and
there
that
unhappy
kiddy
you
forgotten
the
kiddy
do
you
mean
to
say
it
desmond
child
thinking
of
i
ca
understand
any
woman
not
thinking
of
it
said
nicky
he
looked
at
her
and
she
knew
that
he
remembered
veronica
then
she
gave
him
back
his
own
with
interest
for
his
good
if
you
care
so
much
why
do
you
choose
a
better
mother
for
your
own
children
it
was
as
if
she
said
if
you
care
so
much
about
veronica
why
you
marry
it
a
bit
too
late
to
think
of
that
now
said
poor
nicky
because
he
had
cared
so
much
about
veronica
he
was
going
to
marry
desmond
i
could
do
anything
with
him
vera
said
afterwards
nothing
i
said
made
the
least
impression
on
him
that
however
as
both
vera
and
nicky
were
aware
was
not
strictly
true
but
in
spite
of
nicky
terrible
capacity
for
remembering
she
stuck
to
it
that
desmond
affair
would
have
made
no
impression
on
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
other
absurd
affair
of
the
professor
wife
and
it
would
have
been
better
lawrence
stephen
said
for
nicky
to
have
made
love
to
all
the
married
women
in
cambridge
than
for
him
to
marry
phyllis
desmond
these
reflections
were
forced
on
them
by
the
ironic
coincidence
of
nicky
engagement
with
his
rehabilitation
at
the
university
drayton
forecast
was
correct
nicky
brother
michael
had
not
been
removed
from
nicky
college
eight
months
before
letters
of
apology
and
restitution
came
but
both
apology
and
restitution
came
too
late
for
by
that
time
nicky
had
married
desmond
xiv
after
nicholas
veronica
and
after
veronica
michael
anthony
and
frances
sat
in
the
beautiful
of
their
house
one
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
except
for
the
cats
tito
and
timmy
who
crouched
on
the
hearthrug
at
their
feet
frances
forehead
and
her
upper
lip
were
marked
delicately
with
shallow
tender
lines
anthony
eyes
had
at
their
corners
pointing
to
grey
hairs
at
his
temples
to
each
other
their
faces
were
as
they
had
been
fifteen
years
ago
the
flight
of
time
was
measured
for
them
by
the
generations
of
the
cats
that
had
succeeded
jane
and
jerry
for
still
in
secret
they
refused
to
think
of
their
children
as
dorothy
was
upstairs
in
her
study
writing
articles
for
the
franchise
union
they
owed
it
to
her
magnanimity
that
they
had
one
child
remaining
with
them
in
the
house
john
was
at
cheltenham
veronica
was
in
dresden
michael
was
in
germany
too
at
that
school
of
forestry
at
aschaffenburg
which
anthony
had
meant
for
nicky
they
could
bear
to
think
where
nicky
was
when
frances
thought
about
her
children
now
her
mind
went
backwards
if
only
they
had
if
only
they
could
have
stayed
little
for
ever
in
another
four
years
even
would
be
who
was
such
a
long
time
getting
older
that
at
fourteen
only
two
years
ago
he
had
been
capable
of
sitting
in
her
lap
a
great
flumbering
puppy
while
mother
and
son
rocked
dangerously
together
in
each
other
arms
like
two
children
laughing
together
mocking
each
other
she
was
going
to
be
wiser
with
than
she
had
been
with
nicky
she
would
be
wiser
with
michael
when
he
came
back
from
germany
she
would
keep
them
both
out
of
the
vortex
the
horrible
vortex
that
lawrence
stephen
and
vera
had
let
nicky
in
for
the
vortex
that
seized
on
youth
and
forced
it
into
a
corrupt
maturity
after
desmond
affair
anthony
and
frances
felt
that
to
them
the
social
circle
inhabited
by
vera
and
lawrence
stephen
would
never
be
anything
but
a
dirty
hell
as
for
veronica
the
longer
she
stayed
in
germany
the
better
yet
frances
knew
that
they
had
not
sent
veronica
to
dresden
to
prevent
her
mother
from
getting
hold
of
her
when
she
remembered
the
fear
she
had
had
of
the
house
she
said
to
herself
that
desmond
was
a
judgment
on
her
for
sending
little
veronica
away
and
yet
it
was
the
kindest
thing
they
could
have
done
for
her
veronica
was
happy
in
dresden
living
with
a
german
family
and
studying
music
and
the
language
she
had
no
idea
that
music
and
the
language
were
mere
blinds
and
that
she
had
been
sent
to
the
german
family
to
keep
her
out
of
nicky
way
they
would
have
them
all
back
again
at
christmas
frances
counted
the
days
from
the
seventh
of
june
to
december
the
twentieth
was
not
much
more
than
six
months
the
seventh
of
june
was
nicky
but
they
did
not
know
that
nicky
had
kept
the
knowledge
from
them
in
his
mercy
to
save
them
the
agony
of
deciding
whether
they
would
recognize
the
marriage
or
not
and
as
neither
frances
nor
anthony
had
ever
faced
squarely
the
prospect
of
disaster
to
their
children
they
had
turned
their
backs
on
nicky
marriage
and
supported
each
other
in
the
hope
that
at
the
last
minute
something
would
happen
to
prevent
it
the
ten
post
and
two
letters
from
germany
not
from
michael
not
from
veronica
one
from
frau
schäfer
the
mother
of
the
german
family
it
was
all
in
german
and
neither
anthony
nor
frances
could
make
out
more
than
a
word
here
and
there
das
süsse
liebe
mädchen
meant
veronica
but
certain
phrases
traurige
nachrichten
furchtbare
schwächheit
eine
entsetzliche
blutleere
terrified
them
and
they
sent
for
dorothy
to
translate
dorothy
was
a
good
german
scholar
but
somehow
she
was
not
very
fluent
she
scowled
over
the
letter
what
does
it
mean
said
frances
hæmorhage
no
no
anæmia
severe
anæmia
heart
and
stomach
trouble
but
nachrichten
is
news
they
breaking
it
to
us
that
she
dying
it
was
unbearable
to
think
of
nicky
marrying
ronny
but
it
was
more
unbearable
to
think
of
ronny
dying
they
do
say
they
sending
bad
news
they
say
they
think
ronny
must
have
had
some
to
account
for
her
illness
because
they
say
she
been
so
happy
with
them
but
what
bad
news
could
she
have
had
perhaps
she
knows
about
nicky
but
nobody
told
her
unless
vera
has
she
has
i
know
she
has
she
did
want
her
to
know
well
then
mummy
you
do
to
tell
ronny
things
she
always
knows
them
how
on
earth
could
she
know
a
thing
like
that
she
might
she
sort
of
sees
things
like
ferdie
she
may
have
seen
him
with
desmond
you
ca
tell
do
they
say
what
the
doctor
thinks
yes
he
thinks
it
worry
and
heimweh
homesickness
they
want
us
to
send
for
her
and
take
her
back
not
let
her
have
another
term
though
frances
loved
veronica
she
was
afraid
of
her
coming
back
for
she
was
more
than
ever
convinced
that
something
would
happen
and
that
nicky
would
not
marry
desmond
the
other
letter
was
even
more
difficult
to
translate
or
to
understand
when
translated
the
authorities
at
aschaffenburg
requested
herr
harrison
to
remove
his
son
michael
from
the
school
of
forestry
michael
after
his
first
few
weeks
had
done
no
good
at
the
school
in
view
of
the
expense
to
herr
harrison
involved
in
his
fees
and
maintenance
they
could
not
honestly
advise
his
entering
upon
another
term
it
would
only
be
a
deplorable
throwing
away
of
money
on
a
useless
scheme
his
son
michael
had
no
thoroughness
no
practical
ability
and
no
grasp
whatever
of
theoretic
detail
from
herr
harrison
point
of
view
this
was
the
more
regrettable
inasmuch
as
the
young
man
had
colossal
decision
and
persistence
and
energy
of
his
own
he
was
an
indefatigable
dreamer
very
likely
when
his
dreams
had
crystallized
a
poet
but
the
idea
herr
harrison
had
had
that
his
son
michael
would
make
a
man
of
business
or
an
expert
in
forestry
was
altogether
fantastic
and
absurd
and
from
the
desperate
involutions
of
the
final
sentence
dorothy
disentangled
the
clear
fact
that
michael
personal
charm
combined
with
his
hostility
to
discipline
his
complete
indifference
to
the
aims
of
the
authorities
and
his
utter
lack
of
any
sense
of
responsibility
made
him
a
dangerous
influence
in
any
school
that
was
the
end
of
anthony
plans
for
michael
the
next
morning
nicky
wired
from
some
village
in
sussex
married
nicky
after
that
nothing
seemed
to
matter
with
nicky
gone
from
them
they
were
glad
to
have
michael
back
again
frances
said
they
might
be
thankful
for
one
thing
that
there
was
any
german
peggy
or
any
german
desmond
in
michael
problem
and
since
both
michael
and
veronica
were
to
be
removed
at
once
the
simplest
arrangement
was
that
he
should
return
to
dresden
and
bring
her
back
with
him
frances
had
never
been
afraid
for
michael
michael
knew
that
he
had
made
havoc
of
his
father
plans
he
help
that
his
affair
was
far
too
desperate
and
any
other
man
but
his
father
would
have
foreseen
that
the
havoc
was
inevitable
and
would
have
made
no
plans
he
knew
he
had
been
turned
into
the
scheme
that
had
been
meant
for
nicky
because
though
nicky
had
slipped
out
of
it
his
father
simply
could
bear
to
give
up
his
idea
and
no
wonder
when
the
dear
old
thing
had
so
few
of
them
he
had
been
honest
with
his
father
about
it
every
bit
as
honest
as
nicky
had
been
he
had
wanted
to
travel
if
he
could
go
to
china
and
japan
just
as
nicky
had
wanted
to
travel
if
he
could
go
to
places
like
the
west
indies
and
the
himalaya
and
he
did
mind
trying
to
get
the
trees
in
when
he
was
there
he
was
even
prepared
to
accept
germany
and
the
school
for
forestry
if
germany
was
the
only
way
to
china
and
japan
but
he
had
told
his
father
not
to
mind
if
nothing
came
of
it
at
the
end
of
all
the
travelling
and
his
father
had
said
he
would
take
the
risk
he
preferred
taking
the
risk
to
giving
up
his
idea
and
michael
had
been
honest
with
himself
he
had
told
himself
that
he
too
must
take
some
risks
and
the
chances
were
that
a
year
or
two
in
germany
would
really
hurt
him
things
never
did
hurt
you
as
much
as
you
thought
they
would
he
had
thought
that
cambridge
would
do
all
sorts
of
things
to
him
and
cambridge
had
not
done
anything
to
him
at
all
as
for
oxford
it
had
given
him
nearly
all
the
solitude
and
liberty
he
wanted
and
more
companionship
than
he
was
ever
likely
to
want
at
michael
was
no
longer
afraid
of
dying
before
he
had
finished
his
best
work
in
spite
of
both
universities
he
had
done
more
or
less
what
he
had
meant
to
do
before
he
went
to
germany
his
work
had
not
yet
stood
the
test
of
time
but
to
make
up
for
that
he
himself
in
his
uneasy
passion
for
perfection
like
time
destroyed
almost
as
much
as
he
created
still
after
some
pitiless
eliminations
enough
of
his
verse
remained
for
one
fine
thin
book
it
would
be
published
if
lawrence
stephen
approved
of
the
selection
so
michael
argued
even
if
he
died
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
go
to
germany
he
was
too
young
to
know
that
he
acquiesced
so
calmly
because
his
soul
was
for
a
moment
appeased
by
accomplishment
he
was
too
young
to
know
that
his
soul
had
a
delicate
profound
and
hidden
life
of
its
own
and
that
in
secret
it
approached
the
crisis
of
transition
it
was
passing
over
from
youth
to
maturity
like
a
unconscious
enchanted
seeing
its
way
without
seeing
it
safe
only
from
the
dangers
of
the
passage
if
nobody
touched
it
and
if
it
went
alone
michael
had
no
idea
of
what
germany
could
and
would
do
to
his
soul
otherwise
he
might
have
listened
to
what
paris
had
to
say
by
way
of
warning
for
his
father
had
given
him
a
fortnight
in
paris
on
his
way
to
germany
as
the
reward
of
acquiescence
that
from
herr
harrison
point
of
view
was
a
disastrous
blunder
how
could
the
dear
old
pater
be
expected
to
know
that
paris
is
spiritually
speaking
no
sort
of
way
even
to
south
germany
he
should
have
gone
to
brussels
if
he
was
ever
spiritually
speaking
to
get
there
at
all
and
neither
anthony
nor
frances
knew
that
lawrence
stephen
had
plans
for
michael
michael
went
to
paris
with
his
unpublished
poems
in
his
pocket
and
a
letter
of
introduction
from
stephen
to
jules
réveillaud
he
left
it
with
revolution
in
his
soul
and
the
published
poems
of
réveillaud
and
his
followers
in
his
straining
and
distending
it
so
that
it
burst
open
of
its
own
accord
at
the
frontier
lawrence
stephen
had
said
to
him
before
you
write
another
line
read
réveillaud
and
show
him
what
you
written
jules
réveillaud
was
ten
years
older
than
michael
and
he
recognized
the
symptoms
of
the
crisis
he
could
see
what
was
happening
and
what
had
happened
and
would
happen
in
michael
soul
he
said
one
third
of
each
of
your
poems
is
good
and
there
are
a
few
the
three
last
which
are
all
good
those
said
michael
are
only
experiments
precisely
they
are
experiments
that
have
succeeded
that
is
why
they
are
good
art
is
always
experiment
or
it
is
nothing
do
not
publish
these
poems
yet
wait
and
see
what
happens
make
more
experiments
and
whatever
you
do
do
not
go
to
germany
that
school
of
forestry
would
be
very
bad
for
you
why
not
said
réveillaud
stay
where
you
are
michael
would
have
liked
to
stay
for
ever
where
he
was
in
paris
with
jules
réveillaud
in
the
rue
servandoni
and
because
his
conscience
kept
on
telling
him
that
he
would
be
a
coward
and
a
blackguard
if
he
stayed
in
paris
he
wrenched
himself
away
in
the
train
going
into
germany
he
read
réveillaud
poèmes
and
the
poèmes
of
the
young
men
who
followed
him
he
had
read
in
paris
réveillaud
critique
de
la
poésie
anglaise
contemporaine
and
as
he
read
his
poems
he
saw
that
though
he
michael
harrison
had
split
with
la
poésie
anglaise
contemporaine
he
was
not
as
he
had
supposed
alone
his
idea
of
being
by
himself
of
finding
new
forms
doing
new
things
by
himself
to
the
disgust
and
annoyance
of
other
people
in
a
world
where
only
one
person
lawrence
stephen
understood
or
cared
for
what
he
did
it
was
pure
illusion
these
young
frenchmen
with
jules
réveillaud
at
their
head
were
doing
the
same
thing
making
the
same
experiment
believing
in
the
experiment
caring
for
nothing
but
the
experiment
and
carrying
it
farther
than
he
had
dreamed
of
carrying
it
they
were
not
so
far
ahead
of
him
in
time
réveillaud
himself
had
only
two
years
start
but
they
were
all
going
the
same
way
and
he
saw
that
he
must
either
go
with
them
or
collapse
in
the
soft
heap
of
rottenness
la
poésie
anglaise
contemporaine
he
had
made
his
own
experiments
in
what
he
called
live
verse
before
he
left
england
after
he
had
said
he
would
go
to
germany
even
after
the
final
arrangements
had
been
made
his
father
had
given
him
a
month
to
turn
round
in
as
he
put
it
and
michael
had
turned
completely
round
he
had
not
shown
his
experiments
to
stephen
he
did
know
what
to
think
of
them
himself
but
he
could
see
when
once
réveillaud
had
pointed
it
out
to
him
that
they
were
the
stuff
that
counted
in
the
train
going
into
germany
he
thought
of
certain
things
that
réveillaud
had
said
nous
avons
trempé
la
poésie
dans
la
peinture
et
la
musique
il
faut
la
délivrer
par
la
sculpture
chaque
ligne
chaque
vers
chaque
poème
taillé
en
bloc
sans
couleur
sans
decor
sans
la
sainte
pauvresse
du
style
il
faut
de
la
dureté
toujours
de
la
dureté
he
thought
of
réveillaud
criticism
and
his
sudden
startled
spurt
of
admiration
mais
vous
trouvée
la
beauté
de
la
ligne
droite
and
réveillaud
question
vraiment
vous
jamais
lu
un
seul
vers
de
mes
poèmes
alors
étonnant
and
then
que
la
réalité
est
plus
forte
que
nous
the
revolting
irony
of
it
after
stumbling
and
fumbling
for
years
by
himself
like
an
idiot
trying
to
get
it
the
clear
hard
reality
trying
not
to
collapse
into
the
soft
heap
of
contemporary
rottenness
and
suddenly
to
get
it
without
knowing
that
he
had
got
it
so
that
but
for
réveillaud
he
might
easily
have
died
in
his
ignorance
and
then
in
the
incredible
moment
of
realization
to
have
to
let
go
to
turn
his
back
on
paris
where
he
wanted
to
live
and
on
réveillaud
whom
he
wanted
to
know
and
to
be
packed
in
a
damnable
train
like
a
parcel
and
sent
off
to
germany
a
country
which
he
did
not
even
wish
to
see
he
wondered
if
he
could
have
done
it
if
he
had
not
loved
his
father
he
wondered
if
his
father
would
ever
understand
that
it
was
the
hardest
thing
he
had
ever
yet
done
or
could
do
but
the
trees
would
be
beautiful
he
would
rather
like
seeing
the
trees
trees
he
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
care
about
a
tree
again
trees
he
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
see
a
tree
again
ever
smell
or
hear
the
wind
sounding
in
the
like
a
river
and
in
the
firs
like
a
sea
trees
he
wondered
whether
any
tree
would
ever
come
to
life
for
him
again
he
looked
on
at
the
he
saw
slaughtered
trees
trees
that
tottered
trees
that
staggered
in
each
other
branches
he
heard
the
scream
and
the
shriek
of
wounded
boughs
the
creaking
and
crashing
of
the
trunk
and
the
long
hiss
of
branches
falling
trailing
through
branches
to
the
ground
he
smelt
the
raw
juice
of
broken
leaves
and
the
sharp
tree
dust
in
the
saw
pits
the
trees
died
horrible
deaths
in
the
forests
under
the
axes
of
the
woodmen
and
in
the
schools
under
the
tongues
of
the
professors
and
in
michael
soul
the
german
government
was
determined
that
he
should
know
all
about
trees
its
officials
the
professors
and
instructors
were
sorry
if
he
did
like
it
but
they
were
ordered
by
their
government
and
paid
by
their
government
to
impart
this
information
they
had
contracted
with
herr
harrison
to
impart
it
to
his
son
michael
for
so
long
as
he
could
endure
it
and
they
imparted
it
with
all
their
might
michael
rather
liked
the
germans
of
aschaffenburg
instead
of
despising
him
because
he
would
never
make
a
or
a
tree
expert
they
admired
and
respected
him
because
he
was
a
poet
the
family
he
lived
with
herr
henschel
and
frau
henschel
and
his
carl
and
otto
kraus
and
young
ludwig
henschel
and
hedwig
and
löttchen
admired
and
respected
him
because
he
was
a
poet
when
he
walked
with
ludwig
in
the
great
forests
michael
chanted
his
poems
both
in
english
and
in
german
till
ludwig
soul
was
full
of
yearning
and
a
delicious
sorrow
so
that
ludwig
actually
shed
tears
in
the
forest
he
said
that
if
he
had
not
done
so
he
would
have
burst
ludwig
emotions
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
forest
or
with
michael
poems
but
he
thought
they
had
michael
knew
that
his
only
chance
of
getting
out
of
germany
was
to
show
an
unsurpassable
incompetence
he
showed
it
he
flourished
his
incompetence
in
the
faces
of
all
the
officials
until
some
superofficial
wrote
a
letter
to
his
father
that
gave
him
his
liberty
the
henschels
were
sorry
when
he
left
the
students
otto
and
carl
and
ludwig
implored
him
not
to
forget
them
hedwig
and
löttchen
cried
michael
was
not
pleased
when
he
found
that
he
was
to
go
home
by
dresden
to
bring
veronica
back
he
wanted
to
be
alone
on
the
journey
he
wanted
to
stop
in
paris
and
see
jules
réveillaud
he
was
afraid
that
ronny
had
grown
into
a
tiresome
flapper
and
that
he
would
have
to
talk
to
her
and
he
found
that
ronny
had
skipped
the
tiresome
stage
and
had
grown
up
only
her
school
clothes
and
her
girlish
plait
tied
up
with
broad
black
ribbon
reminded
him
that
she
was
not
yet
seventeen
ronny
was
tired
she
did
not
want
to
talk
when
he
had
tucked
her
up
with
railway
rugs
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
she
sat
still
with
her
hands
in
her
muff
i
shall
not
disturb
your
thoughts
michael
she
said
she
knew
what
he
had
been
thinking
her
clear
eyes
gazed
at
him
out
of
her
dead
white
face
with
an
awful
look
of
spiritual
maturity
what
can
have
happened
to
her
he
wondered
but
she
did
not
disturb
his
thoughts
up
till
then
michael
thoughts
had
not
done
him
any
good
they
had
been
bitter
thoughts
of
the
months
he
had
been
compelled
to
waste
in
bavaria
when
every
minute
had
an
incomparable
value
worrying
irritating
thoughts
of
the
scenes
he
would
have
to
have
with
his
father
who
must
be
made
to
understand
once
for
all
that
in
future
he
meant
to
have
every
minute
of
his
own
life
for
his
own
work
he
wondered
how
on
earth
he
was
to
make
his
people
see
that
his
work
justified
his
giving
every
minute
to
it
he
had
asked
réveillaud
to
give
him
a
letter
that
he
could
show
to
his
father
he
was
angry
with
his
father
beforehand
he
was
so
certain
that
he
would
see
he
had
other
thoughts
now
thoughts
of
an
almond
tree
flowering
in
a
white
town
of
pink
blossoms
fragile
without
leaves
casting
a
thin
shadow
on
white
stones
the
smell
of
almond
flowers
and
the
sting
of
white
dust
in
an
east
wind
a
drift
of
white
dust
against
the
wall
thoughts
of
falling
in
the
forest
glad
to
fall
he
thought
the
pine
forest
makes
itself
a
sea
for
the
land
wind
and
the
young
pine
tree
is
mad
for
the
open
sea
she
gives
her
slender
trunk
with
passion
to
the
ax
for
she
thinks
that
she
will
be
stripped
naked
and
that
she
will
be
planted
in
the
ship
hold
and
that
she
will
carry
the
great
she
thinks
that
she
will
rock
and
strain
in
the
grip
of
the
and
that
she
will
be
whitened
with
the
salt
and
the
foam
of
the
sea
she
does
not
know
that
she
will
be
sawn
into
planks
and
made
into
a
coffin
for
the
wife
of
the
sexton
and
of
aschaffenburg
thoughts
of
veronica
in
her
incredible
maturity
and
of
her
eyes
shining
in
her
dead
white
face
far
back
through
deep
crystal
and
of
the
sense
he
got
of
her
soul
poised
steady
and
still
with
wings
vibrating
he
wondered
where
it
would
come
down
he
thought
of
course
veronica
soul
will
come
down
like
a
wild
pigeon
into
the
in
our
garden
and
she
will
think
that
our
is
a
tree
of
heaven
presently
he
roused
himself
to
talk
to
her
how
is
your
singing
getting
on
ronny
my
singing
voice
has
gone
it
come
back
again
not
but
he
could
make
her
tell
him
what
would
bring
it
back
when
michael
came
to
his
father
and
mother
to
have
it
out
with
them
his
face
had
a
hard
stubborn
look
he
was
ready
to
fight
them
he
was
so
certain
that
he
would
have
to
fight
he
had
shown
them
jules
réveillaud
letter
he
said
look
here
we
got
to
get
it
straight

is
any
use
going
on
like
this
i
afraid
i
was
very
honest
about
germany
were
you
said
anthony
let
me
see
i
think
you
said
you
take
it
on
your
way
to
china
and
japan
did
i
i
tried
to
be
straight
about
it
i
thought
i
was
giving
it
a
fair
chance
but
that
was
before
i
seen
réveillaud
well
said
anthony
now
that
you
have
seen
him
what
is
it
exactly
that
you
want
to
do
michael
told
him

make
it
easy
for

make
it
hard

stop
me

want
to
stop
you

want
me

where

rub
along
somehow
without
my
help
you
mean
well
yes
why
you
help

tons
of
money
on
me
as
it
is
nicky
earning
his
own
living

a
wife

because
you
ca

i
do
mean
you

try
you

the
best
possible
conditions
whether

nothing
in
the
world

us
but
your
happiness

and
fifty
a
year

nicky
michael
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
oh
do
daddy
you
do
make
me
feel
a
rotten
beast
we
should
feel
rottener
beasts
said
frances
if
we
stood
in
your
way
then
said
michael
he
was
still
incredulous
you
do
care
of
course
we
care
said
anthony
i
do
mean
for
me
for
my
dear
mick
said
frances
we
care
for
it
almost
as
much
as
we
care
for
you
we
sorry
about
germany
though
germany
was
one
of
your
father
bad
jokes
germany
a
joke
did
you
take
it
seriously
oh
you
silly
michael
but
said
michael
how
about
daddy
idea
he
loved
it
i
loved
it
said
anthony
but
i
given
it
up
they
knew
that
this
was
defeat
for
michael
was
and
it
was
also
victory
they
had
lost
nicholas
or
thought
they
had
lost
nicholas
by
opposing
him
but
michael
and
michael
affection
they
would
have
always
besides
anthony
had
given
up
his
idea
he
had
only
transferred
it
to
his
youngest
son
john
xv
it
was
five
weeks
since
nicholas
and
desmond
had
quarrelled
with
him
three
times
first
because
he
had
taken
a
flat
in
aubrey
walk
with
a
studio
inside
it
instead
of
a
house
in
campden
hill
square
with
a
studio
outside
it
in
the
garden
then
because
he
had
refused
to
go
into
his
father
business
last
of
all
because
of
captain
drayton
and
the
moving
fortress
nicky
had
said
that
his
father
who
was
paying
his
rent
could
afford
the
house
with
the
studio
in
the
garden
and
desmond
said
nicky
father
could
afford
it
perfectly
well
if
he
liked
he
said
he
had
refused
to
go
into
his
father
business
for
reasons
which
did
concern
her
desmond
pointed
out
that
the
consequences
of
his
refusal
were
likely
to
concern
her
very
much
indeed
as
for
captain
drayton
and
the
moving
fortress
nobody
but
a
supreme
idiot
would
have
done
what
nicky
did
but
nicky
absolutely
refused
to
discuss
what
he
had
done
nobody
but
a
cad
and
a
rotter
would
have
done
anything
else
in
the
matter
of
the
moving
fortress
what
had
happened
was
this
the
last
of
the
drawings
was
not
finished
until
desmond
had
settled
down
in
the
flat
in
aubrey
walk
you
could
hurry
desmond
nicky
even
waited
to
sign
his
name
in
the
margins
before
he
had
packed
the
plans
in
his
dispatch
box
and
taken
them
to
the
works
and
thence
hidden
under
a
pile
of
morss
estimates
to
eltham
he
could
rest
till
he
had
shown
them
to
frank
drayton
he
could
hardly
wait
till
they
had
dined
and
till
drayton
who
thought
he
was
on
the
track
of
a
new
and
horrible
explosive
had
told
him
as
much
as
he
could
about
it
nicky
gave
his
whole
mind
to
drayton
new
explosive
in
the
hope
that
when
his
turn
came
drayton
would
do
as
much
for
him
you
know
he
said
at
last
the
old
idea
of
the
yes
he
could
tell
whether
drayton
was
going
to
be
interested
or
not
he
rather
thought
he
was
it
has
come
to
anything
it
drayton
smiled
and
his
eyes
glittered
he
knew
what
that
excited
gleam
in
drayton
eyes
meant
no
he
said
not
yet
and
nicky
had
an
awful
premonition
of
his
doom
well
he
said
i
believe
there
something
in
it
so
do
i
nicky
drayton
went
on
i
believe
there
so
much
in
it
that
look
here
i
do
know
what
put
it
into
your
head
and
i
not
asking
but
that
idea
a
dead
secret
for
god
sake
do
talk
about
it
you
breathe
it
or
it
get
into
the
air
and
if
it
does
my
five
work
goes
for
nothing
besides
we
do
want
germany
to
collar
it
and
then
do
look
so
scared
old
chap
i
was
going
to
tell
you
about
it
when
i
got
the
plans
drawn
he
told
him
about
it
then
and
there
low
on
the
ground
like
a
yes
said
nicky
revolving
turret
for
the
guns
no
higher
than
yes
said
nicky
sort
of
armoured
train
only
it
must
run
on
rails
it
got
to
go
everywhere
through
anything
over
anything
if
it
goes
at
all
it
must
turn
in
its
own
length
it
must
wade
and
burrow
and
climb
nicky
it
must
have
caterpillar
wheels
by
jove
of
course
it
must
said
nicky
as
if
the
idea
had
struck
him
for
the
first
time
what
have
you
got
there
said
drayton
finally
as
nicky
rose
and
picked
up
his
anything
interesting
no
said
nicky
mostly
estimates
for
a
long
time
afterwards
he
loathed
the
fields
between
eltham
and
kidbrooke
and
the
line
and
charing
cross
station
he
felt
as
a
man
feels
when
the
woman
he
loves
goes
from
him
to
another
man
his
idea
had
gone
from
him
to
drayton
and
that
he
said
to
himself
was
just
like
his
luck
just
like
the
jolly
sells
that
happened
to
him
when
he
was
a
kid
to
be
sure
there
was
such
a
thing
as
sharing
he
had
only
to
produce
his
plans
and
his
finished
model
and
he
and
drayton
would
go
partners
in
the
moving
fortress
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
do
it
drayton
had
not
even
drawn
his
plans
yet
he
had
thought
out
the
mechanical
details
he
thought
i
could
go
back
now
and
tell
him
but
he
did
not
go
back
he
knew
that
he
would
never
tell
him
if
drayton
asked
him
to
help
him
with
the
details
he
would
work
them
out
all
over
again
with
him
but
he
would
never
show
his
own
finished
plans
or
his
own
model
he
did
know
whether
it
had
been
hard
or
easy
for
him
to
give
up
the
moving
fortress
he
did
it
instinctively
there
was
unless
he
had
chosen
to
be
a
blackguard
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
besides
the
moving
fortress
was
his
idea
drayton
had
had
it
first
anybody
might
have
had
it
he
had
spoken
of
it
first
but
that
was
nothing
the
point
was
that
he
had
had
it
first
and
nicky
was
going
to
take
it
from
him
it
meant
more
to
drayton
who
was
in
the
service
than
it
could
possibly
mean
to
him
he
had
even
got
a
profession
as
he
walked
back
through
the
fields
to
the
station
he
said
to
himself
that
he
did
really
care
it
was
only
one
more
jolly
sell
he
like
giving
up
his
moving
fortress
but
it
would
end
him
there
was
something
in
him
that
would
go
on
he
would
make
another
engine
he
did
care
there
was
something
in
him
that
would
go
on
i
ca
see
desmond
had
said
why
captain
drayton
should
be
allowed
to
walk
off
with
your
idea
he
worked
five
years
on
it
he
has
worked
it
yet
and
you
have
ca
you
see
her
face
was
dark
and
hard
with
anger
there
money
in
it
if
there
is
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
bag
it
and
where
do
i
come
in
not
just
here
i
afraid
it
is
your
business
not
my
business
when
i
did
the
drawings
you
could
possibly
have
done
them
yourself
at
that
point
nicky
refused
to
discuss
the
matter
farther
and
still
desmond
brooded
on
her
grievance
and
still
at
intervals
desmond
brought
it
up
again
there
stacks
of
money
in
your
father
business
there
stacks
of
money
in
that
moving
fortress
you
are
a
fool
nicky
to
throw
it
all
away
he
never
answered
her
he
said
to
himself
that
desmond
was
hysterical
and
had
a
morbid
fancy
but
it
did
end
there
he
had
taken
the
drawings
and
the
box
that
had
the
model
of
the
moving
fortress
in
it
and
buried
them
in
the
locker
under
the
big
north
window
in
desmond
studio
and
there
three
weeks
later
desmond
found
them
and
she
packed
the
model
of
the
moving
fortress
and
marked
it
urgent
with
care
and
sent
it
to
the
war
office
with
a
letter
she
packed
the
drawings
in
a
portfolio
having
signed
her
own
and
nicky
name
on
the
margins
and
sent
them
to
captain
drayton
with
a
letter
she
said
she
had
no
doubt
she
was
doing
an
immoral
thing
but
she
did
it
in
fairness
to
captain
drayton
for
she
was
sure
he
would
not
like
nicky
to
make
so
great
a
sacrifice
nicky
she
said
was
wrapped
up
in
his
moving
fortress
it
was
his
sweetheart
his
baby
he
will
never
forgive
me
she
said
as
long
as
he
lives
but
i
simply
had
to
let
you
know
it
means
so
much
to
him
for
she
thought
because
nicky
a
fool
i
need
be
one
drayton
came
over
the
same
evening
after
he
had
got
the
letter
he
shouted
with
laughter
nicky
he
said
you
filthy
rotter
why
on
earth
did
you
tell
me
it
nickyish
of
you
what
if
i
did
think
of
it
first
i
should
have
had
to
come
to
you
for
the
details
it
would
have
been
jolly
to
have
worked
it
out
together
not
a
bit
of
it
your
absolutely
right
good
thing
after
all
you
married
her
by
the
way
she
says
there
a
model
i
want
to
see
that
model
have
you
got
it
here
nicky
went
up
into
the
studio
to
look
for
it
he
could
find
it
in
the
locker
where
he
left
it
wherever
is
the
damned
thing
he
said
the
damned
thing
said
desmond
is
where
you
should
have
sent
it
first
of
all
at
the
war
office
you
clever
nicky
but
you
quite
clever
enough
i
afraid
he
said
been
a
bit
too
clever
this
time
drayton
agreed
with
him
it
was
he
said
about
the
worst
thing
that
could
possibly
have
happened
she
should
have
done
that
nicky
what
on
earth
could
have
made
her
do
it
do
ask
me
said
nicky
what
makes
her
do
things
it
looks
drayton
meditated
as
if
she
did
trust
me
i
afraid
she
dished
us
god
knows
whether
we
can
ever
get
it
back
desmond
had
a
fit
of
hysterics
when
she
realized
how
clever
she
had
been
desmond
baby
was
born
late
in
november
of
that
year
and
it
died
when
it
was
two
weeks
old
it
was
as
if
she
had
not
wanted
it
enough
to
give
it
life
for
long
outside
her
body
for
though
desmond
had
been
determined
to
have
a
child
and
had
declared
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
have
one
if
she
chose
she
did
not
care
for
it
when
it
came
and
when
it
died
nicky
was
sorrier
than
desmond
he
had
not
wanted
to
be
a
father
to
headley
richards
child
and
yet
it
was
the
baby
and
nothing
but
the
baby
that
had
let
him
in
for
marrying
desmond
so
that
when
it
died
he
felt
that
somehow
things
had
tricked
and
sold
him
as
they
had
turned
out
he
need
not
have
married
desmond
after
all
she
herself
had
pointed
out
the
extreme
futility
of
his
behaviour
lest
he
should
miss
the
peculiar
irony
of
it
for
when
her
fright
and
the
cause
of
her
fright
were
gone
desmond
resented
nicky
having
married
her
she
did
really
want
anybody
to
marry
her
and
nobody
but
nicky
would
have
dreamed
of
doing
it
she
lay
weak
and
pathetic
in
her
bed
for
about
a
fortnight
and
for
a
little
while
after
she
was
content
to
lie
stretched
out
among
her
cushions
on
the
studio
floor
while
nicky
waited
on
her
but
when
she
got
well
and
came
downstairs
for
good
nicky
saw
that
desmond
weakness
and
pathos
had
come
with
the
baby
and
had
gone
with
it
the
real
desmond
was
not
weak
she
was
not
pathetic
she
was
strong
and
hard
and
clever
with
a
brutal
cleverness
she
did
care
how
much
he
saw
he
could
see
to
the
bottom
of
her
nature
if
he
liked
and
feel
how
hard
it
was
she
had
no
more
interest
in
deceiving
him
she
had
no
more
interest
in
him
at
all
she
was
interested
in
her
painting
again
she
worked
in
long
fits
after
long
intervals
of
idleness
she
worked
with
a
hard
passionless
efficiency
nicky
thought
her
paintings
were
hideous
and
repulsive
but
he
did
not
say
so
he
was
not
aware
of
the
extent
to
which
desmond
imitated
her
master
alfred
he
knew
nothing
about
painting
and
he
had
got
used
to
the
things
he
had
got
used
to
desmond
slouching
about
the
flat
in
her
sloping
slovenly
grace
dressed
in
her
queer
square
jacket
and
straight
short
skirt
showing
her
long
delicate
ankles
and
her
slender
feet
in
their
grey
stockings
and
black
slippers
he
was
used
to
desmond
when
she
was
lazy
when
she
sat
hunched
up
on
her
cushions
and
smoked
one
cigarette
after
another
without
a
word
and
watched
him
sullenly
her
long
slippered
feet
thrust
out
pointed
at
him
watching
her
long
face
watched
him
between
the
sleek
bands
of
hair
and
the
big
black
bosses
plaited
over
her
ears
the
beauty
of
desmond
face
had
gone
to
sleep
again
stilled
into
hardness
by
the
passing
of
her
passion
a
sort
of
ugliness
was
awake
there
and
it
watched
him
in
putting
weakness
and
pathos
away
from
her
desmond
had
parted
with
of
her
power
yet
the
third
part
still
served
to
hold
him
used
with
knowledge
and
a
cold
and
competent
economy
he
resented
it
resisted
it
over
and
over
again
and
over
and
over
again
it
conquered
resentment
and
resistance
it
had
something
to
do
with
her
subtle
sloping
lines
with
her
blackness
and
her
sallow
whiteness
with
the
delicate
scent
and
the
smoothness
of
her
skin
under
the
sliding
hand
he
could
touch
her
without
still
feeling
a
sort
of
pity
a
sort
of
affection
but
she
could
take
and
give
caresses
while
she
removed
her
soul
from
him
in
stubborn
rancour
he
could
understand
that
it
amazed
him
every
time
he
thought
it
horrible
for
nicky
memory
was
faithful
it
still
kept
the
impression
of
the
desmond
he
had
married
the
tender
frightened
helpless
desmond
he
had
thought
he
loved
the
desmond
he
remembered
reminded
him
of
veronica
and
desmond
said
to
herself
he
impossible
you
ca
make
any
impression
on
him
i
might
as
well
be
married
to
a
moving
fortress
months
passed
the
war
office
had
not
yet
given
up
nicky
model
of
the
moving
fortress
in
the
first
month
it
was
not
aware
of
any
letter
or
of
any
parcel
or
of
any
nicholas
harrison
in
the
second
month
inquiries
would
be
made
and
the
results
communicated
to
captain
drayton
in
the
third
month
the
war
office
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
referred
to
by
captain
drayton
drayton
had
a
hope
we
ca
get
it
back
nicky
he
said
i
can
said
nicky
i
can
get
it
back
out
of
my
head
all
through
the
winter
of
and
the
spring
of
they
worked
at
it
together
they
owned
that
they
were
thus
getting
better
results
than
either
of
them
could
have
got
alone
there
were
impossibilities
about
nicky
model
that
a
gunner
would
have
seen
at
once
and
there
were
faults
in
drayton
plans
that
an
engineer
would
not
have
made
nicky
could
draw
the
plans
and
drayton
build
the
models
they
said
it
was
fifty
times
better
fun
to
work
at
it
together
nicky
was
happy
desmond
watched
them
sombrely
she
and
alfred
the
painter
laughed
at
them
behind
their
backs
she
said
how
funny
they
are
frank
would
hurt
a
fly
and
nicky
would
say
to
a
goose
if
he
thought
it
would
frighten
the
goose
and
yet
they
only
happy
when
they
inventing
some
horrible
machine
that
kill
thousands
of
people
who
never
did
them
any
harm
he
said
that
because
they
have
any
imagination
nicky
got
up
early
and
went
to
bed
late
to
work
at
the
moving
fortress
the
time
between
had
to
be
given
to
the
works
the
company
had
paid
him
fairly
well
for
all
his
patents
in
the
hope
of
getting
more
of
his
ideas
and
when
they
found
that
no
ideas
were
forthcoming
they
took
it
out
of
him
in
labour
he
was
too
busy
and
too
happy
to
notice
what
desmond
was
doing
one
day
vera
said
to
him
nicky
do
you
know
that
desmond
is
going
about
a
good
deal
with
alfred
is
she
is
there
any
reason
why
she
should
not
unless
you
call
a
reason
you
mean
i
got
to
stop
it
how
can
i
you
ca
nothing
can
stop
desmond
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
about
it
nothing
she
goes
about
with
scores
of
people
it
does
follow
that
there
anything
in
it
oh
lord
i
should
hope
not
that
beastly
bounder
what
there
be
in
it
he
a
clever
painter
nicky
so
desmond
there
that
in
it
i
hardly
a
right
to
object
to
that
have
i
it
not
as
if
i
were
a
clever
painter
myself
but
as
he
walked
home
between
the
gardens
of
wood
and
through
regent
park
and
baker
street
and
down
the
north
side
of
hyde
park
and
kensington
gardens
he
worried
the
thing
to
shreds
there
could
be
anything
in
it
he
could
see
alfred
the
raking
swagger
of
the
tall
lean
body
in
the
loose
trousers
the
slouch
hat
and
the
flowing
tie
he
could
see
his
flowing
black
hair
and
his
haggard
eccentric
face
with
its
seven
fantastic
accents
the
black
eyebrows
the
black
moustache
the
high
side
whiskers
the
two
forks
of
the
black
beard
there
could
be
anything
in
it
mouth
was
full
of
rotten
teeth
and
yet
he
never
came
home
rather
later
than
usual
without
saying
to
himself
supposing
i
was
to
find
him
there
with
her
he
left
off
coming
home
late
so
that
he
should
have
to
ask
himself
that
question
he
wondered
what
if
it
really
did
happen
he
would
do
he
wondered
what
other
men
did
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
at
he
was
young
to
be
considering
this
problem
he
rehearsed
scenes
that
were
only
less
fantastic
than
face
and
figure
or
that
owed
their
element
of
fantasy
to
face
and
figure
he
saw
himself
assaulting
with
violence
dragging
him
out
of
desmond
studio
and
throwing
him
downstairs
he
wondered
what
shapes
that
body
and
those
legs
and
arms
would
take
when
they
got
to
the
bottom
perhaps
they
would
get
to
the
bottom
all
at
once
he
would
hang
on
to
the
banisters
he
saw
himself
simply
opening
the
door
of
the
studio
and
ordering
to
walk
out
of
it
really
there
would
be
nothing
else
for
him
to
do
but
to
walk
out
and
he
would
look
an
awful
ass
doing
it
he
saw
himself
standing
in
the
room
and
looking
at
them
and
saying
i
no
intention
of
interrupting
you
perhaps
desmond
would
answer
you
not
interrupting
us
we
finished
all
we
had
to
say
and
would
walk
out
and
leave
them
there
not
caring
he
wondered
if
would
look
an
awful
ass
doing
it
in
the
end
when
it
came
he
had
to
do
any
of
these
things
it
happened
very
quietly
and
simply
early
on
a
sunday
evening
after
he
had
got
back
from
eltham
he
had
dined
with
drayton
and
his
people
on
saturday
and
stayed
for
once
risking
it
desmond
was
sitting
on
a
cushion
on
the
floor
with
her
thin
legs
in
their
grey
stockings
slanting
out
in
front
of
her
she
propped
her
chin
on
her
hands
her
thin
long
face
between
the
great
black
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
without
rancour
nicky
she
said
alfred
slept
with
me
last
night
and
he
said
simply
and
quietly
very
well
desmond
then
i
shall
leave
you
you
can
keep
the
flat
and
i
or
my
father
will
make
you
an
allowance
i
sha
divorce
you
but
i
wo
live
with
you
why
wo
you
divorce
me
she
said
because
i
do
want
to
drag
you
through
the
dirt
she
laughed
quietly
dear
nicky
she
said
how
sweet
and
like
you
but
do
let
have
any
more
chivalrous
idiocy
i
do
want
it
i
never
did
she
had
forgotten
that
she
had
wanted
it
very
badly
once
but
nicky
did
not
remind
her
of
that
time
no
matter
she
did
want
it
now
let
look
at
the
thing
sensibly
without
any
rotten
sentiment
we
had
some
good
times
together
and
we
had
some
bad
times
admit
that
when
you
married
me
you
saved
me
from
a
very
bad
time
that
no
reason
why
we
should
go
on
giving
each
other
worse
times
indefinitely
you
seem
to
think
i
do
want
you
to
divorce
me
what
else
do
you
imagine
alfred
came
for
last
night
why
we
been
trying
for
it
for
the
last
three
months
of
course
if
you
let
divorce
for
desertion
it
would
be
very
nice
of
you
that
said
desmond
is
what
decent
people
do
he
went
out
and
telephoned
to
his
father
then
he
left
her
and
went
back
to
his
father
house
desmond
asked
the
servant
to
remember
particularly
that
it
was
the
fifteenth
of
june
and
that
the
master
was
going
away
and
would
not
come
back
again
as
nicky
walked
up
the
hill
and
across
the
heath
he
wondered
why
it
had
happened
and
why
now
that
it
had
happened
he
cared
so
little
he
could
have
understood
it
if
he
had
cared
at
all
for
desmond
but
he
had
cared
in
a
sort
of
way
if
she
had
cared
at
all
for
him
he
thought
they
might
have
made
something
of
it
something
enduring
perhaps
if
they
had
had
children
of
their
own
he
still
could
think
why
it
had
happened
but
he
knew
that
even
if
he
had
loved
desmond
with
passion
it
would
have
been
the
end
of
him
the
part
of
him
that
did
care
that
had
cared
much
when
he
lost
his
moving
fortress
was
the
part
that
desmond
never
would
have
cared
for
he
did
know
whether
it
was
outside
him
and
beyond
him
bigger
and
stronger
than
he
was
or
whether
it
was
deep
inside
the
most
real
part
of
him
whatever
happened
or
did
happen
it
would
go
on
how
could
he
have
ended
with
poor
little
desmond
there
was
something
ahead
of
him
something
that
he
felt
to
be
tremendous
and
holy
he
had
always
known
it
waited
for
him
he
was
going
out
to
meet
it
and
because
of
it
he
did
care
and
after
a
year
of
desmond
he
was
glad
to
go
back
to
his
house
even
though
he
knew
that
the
thing
that
waited
for
him
was
not
there
frances
and
anthony
were
happy
again
after
all
heaven
had
manipulated
their
happiness
with
exquisite
art
and
wisdom
letting
michael
and
nicholas
go
from
them
for
a
little
while
that
they
might
have
them
again
more
completely
and
teaching
them
the
art
and
wisdom
that
would
keep
them
some
day
the
children
would
marry
even
nicky
might
marry
again
they
would
prepare
now
by
small
daily
for
the
big
renunciation
that
must
come
yet
in
secret
they
thought
that
michael
would
never
marry
that
nicky
made
prudent
by
disaster
was
really
likely
to
marry
again
john
would
marry
and
they
would
be
happy
in
john
happiness
and
in
john
children
and
nicky
had
not
been
home
before
he
offered
to
his
parents
the
spectacle
of
an
outrageous
gaiety
you
would
have
said
that
life
to
nicholas
was
an
amusing
game
where
you
might
win
or
lose
but
either
way
it
did
matter
it
was
a
rag
a
sell
even
the
preceedings
the
involved
and
ridiculous
proceedings
of
his
divorce
amused
him
it
was
undeniably
funny
that
he
should
be
supposed
to
have
deserted
desmond
frances
wondered
again
whether
nicky
really
had
any
feelings
and
whether
things
really
made
any
impression
on
him
xvi
it
was
a
quarter
past
five
on
a
fine
morning
early
in
july
on
the
stroke
of
the
quarter
captain
frank
drayton
after
exceeding
the
speed
limit
along
the
forlorn
highway
of
the
caledonian
road
drew
up
outside
the
main
entrance
of
holloway
gaol
captain
frank
drayton
was
alone
in
his
he
had
the
street
all
to
himself
till
twenty
past
five
when
he
was
joined
by
another
motorist
also
conspicuously
alone
in
his
car
drayton
tried
hard
to
look
as
if
the
other
man
were
not
there
the
other
man
tried
even
harder
to
look
as
if
he
were
not
there
himself
he
was
the
first
to
be
aware
of
the
absurdity
of
their
competitive
pretences
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
spoke
i
hope
they
be
punctual
with
those
doors
i
was
up
at
four
i
said
drayton
was
up
at
three
i
waiting
for
my
wife
said
the
other
man
i
am
said
drayton
and
felt
that
he
had
scored
the
other
man
smile
allowed
him
the
point
he
made
yes
but
my
wife
happens
to
be
lady
victoria
threlfall
the
other
man
laughed
as
if
he
had
made
by
far
the
better
joke
drayton
recognized
augustin
threlfall
that
cabinet
minister
made
notorious
by
his
encounters
with
the
women
franchise
union
last
year
miss
maud
blackadder
had
stalked
him
in
the
green
park
and
lamed
him
by
a
blow
from
her
this
year
his
wife
lady
victoria
threlfall
had
headed
the
june
raid
on
the
house
of
commons
and
here
he
was
at
twenty
minutes
past
five
in
the
morning
waiting
to
take
her
out
of
prison
and
here
was
drayton
waiting
for
dorothea
who
was
not
his
wife
yet
anyhow
said
the
cabinet
minister
we
done
them
out
of
their
procession
what
procession
all
that
drayton
knew
about
it
was
that
late
last
night
a
friend
he
had
in
the
home
office
had
telephoned
to
him
that
the
hour
of
miss
dorothea
harrison
release
would
be
not
as
the
papers
had
it
the
procession
said
the
cabinet
minister
that
was
to
have
met
at
a
car
of
victory
for
blathwaite
and
a
bodyguard
of
thirteen
young
women
on
thirteen
white
horses
the
girl
who
smashed
my
is
to
be
joan
of
arc
and
ride
at
the
head
of
in
armour
fact
there
to
be
a
banquet
for
at
the
imperial
at
nine
we
stop
and
they
process
down
the
embankment
and
down
pall
mall
and
piccadilly
at
eleven
but
they
wo
process
here
we
let
out
an
hour
too
soon
a
policeman
came
from
the
he
blew
a
whistle
four
crept
round
the
corner
furtively
driven
by
visibly
hilarious
chauffeurs
the
triumphant
procession
from
holloway
said
the
cabinet
minister
is
you
and
me
sir
and
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
gates
a
woman
laughed
the
released
prisoners
were
coming
down
the
the
cabinet
minister
cranked
up
his
engine
with
an
unctuous
glee
he
was
boyishly
happy
because
he
and
the
home
secretary
had
done
them
out
of
the
car
of
victory
and
the
thirteen
white
horses
the
opened
the
cabinet
minister
and
drayton
raised
their
caps
the
leaders
blathwaite
and
angela
blathwaite
and
came
first
then
lady
victoria
threlfall
then
dorothea
then
sixteen
other
women
drayton
did
not
look
at
them
he
did
not
see
what
happened
when
the
cabinet
minister
met
his
wife
he
did
not
see
the
sixteen
other
women
he
saw
nothing
but
dorothea
walking
by
herself
she
had
no
hat
on
her
clothes
were
as
the
great
raid
had
left
them
a
month
ago
her
serge
coat
was
torn
at
the
breast
pocket
the
flap
hung
showing
the
white
lining
another
flap
hung
from
her
right
knee
she
carried
her
small
head
alert
and
high
her
face
had
the
incomparable
bloom
of
youth
her
eyes
shone
they
and
her
face
showed
no
memory
of
the
the
and
the
prison
walls
they
showed
no
sense
of
drayton
decency
in
coming
to
meet
her
no
sense
of
anything
at
all
but
of
the
queerness
the
greatness
and
the
glory
of
the
world
of
him
perhaps
as
a
part
of
it
she
stepped
into
the
car
as
if
they
had
met
by
appointment
for
a
run
into
the
country
i
sha
hurt
your
car
quite
clean
though
you
might
think
it
the
cells
were
all
right
this
time
he
disapproved
of
her
yet
he
adored
her
dorothy
he
said
do
you
want
to
go
to
that
banquet
no
but
i
got
to
i
must
go
through
with
it
i
swore
i
do
the
thing
completely
or
not
at
all
it
is
till
nine
we
three
whole
hours
before
we
need
start
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
i
going
to
take
you
home
first
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
drive
you
down
to
that
beastly
banquet
that
wo
take
three
and
a
half
hours
it
a
heavenly
morning
we
do
something
with
it
what
would
you
like
to
do
i
like
to
stop
at
the
nearest
i
hungry
then
are
you
frightfully
sleepy
me
oh
lord
no
then
let
go
off
somewhere
into
the
country
they
went
they
pulled
up
in
a
green
lane
near
totteridge
to
finish
the
buns
they
had
brought
with
them
from
the
did
you
ever
smell
anything
like
this
lane
did
you
ever
eat
anything
like
these
buns
did
you
ever
drink
anything
like
that
divine
coffee
if
epicures
had
any
imagination
they
go
out
and
obstruct
policemen
and
get
put
in
prison
for
the
sake
of
the
sensations
they
have
afterwards
that
reminds
me
he
said
that
i
want
to
talk
to
you
no
but
seriously
i
do
mind
how
seriously
you
talk
if
i
may
go
on
eating
that
what
i
brought
the
buns
for
so
that
i
may
be
interrupted
first
of
all
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
have
taken
me
in
other
people
may
be
impressed
with
this
holloway
business
but
not
me
i
not
moved
or
touched
or
even
interested
still
she
murmured
you
did
get
up
at
three
in
the
morning
if
you
think
i
got
up
at
three
in
the
morning
to
show
my
sympathy
you
mistaken
sympathy
i
do
need
your
sympathy
it
was
worth
it
frank
there
is
anything
on
earth
like
coming
out
of
prison
unless
it
is
going
in
that
wo
work
dorothy
when
i
know
why
you
went
in
it
was
to
prove
your
principles
your
principles
were
against
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
to
get
votes
for
women
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
never
get
them
that
way
it
was
to
annoy
asquith
you
knew
asquith
would
care
a
hang
it
was
to
annoy
me
i
wonder
she
said
dreamily
if
i
shall
be
able
to
stop
eating
you
ca
take
me
in
i
know
too
much
about
it
you
said
you
were
going
to
keep
out
of
rows
you
were
going
on
that
deputation
because
it
meant
a
row
you
went
because
i
asked
you
not
to
go
i
did
and
i
should
go
again
tomorrow
for
the
same
reason
but
it
is
a
reason
it
not
as
if
i
asked
you
to
go
against
your
conscience
your
conscience
had
anything
to
do
with
it
oh
had
it
i
went
because
you
no
right
to
ask
me
not
to
if
i
had
the
right
you
have
gone
just
the
same
what
do
you
mean
by
the
right
you
know
perfectly
well
what
i
mean
of
course
i
do
you
mean
and
you
meant
that
if
i
married
you
have
had
the
right
not
just
to
ask
me
not
to
but
to
prevent
me
that
was
what
i
was
out
against
i
be
out
against
it
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
for
as
long
as
you
keep
up
that
attitude
and
yet
you
said
you
loved
me
so
i
did
so
i
do
but
i
out
against
that
too
good
lord
against
what
against
your
exploiting
my
love
for
your
purposes
my
poor
dear
child
what
do
you
suppose
i
wanted
she
had
reached
the
uttermost
limit
of
absurdity
and
in
that
moment
she
became
to
him
helpless
and
pathetic
i
knew
there
was
going
to
be
the
most
infernal
row
and
i
wanted
to
keep
you
out
of
it
look
here
you
have
thought
me
a
rotter
if
i
had
would
you
of
course
you
would
and
there
another
thing
you
were
straight
about
it
you
never
told
me
you
were
going
i
never
told
you
i
was
i
do
care
dorothy
you
were
straight
you
ought
to
have
told
me
how
could
i
tell
you
when
i
knew
you
only
go
trying
to
stop
me
and
getting
yourself
arrested
not
me
they
would
have
touched
me
how
was
i
to
know
that
if
they
had
i
should
have
dished
you
and
have
stayed
away
rather
than
do
that
i
did
tell
michael
or
nicky
or
father
for
the
same
reason
you
have
stayed
at
home
rather
than
have
dished
me
do
you
really
mean
that
of
course
i
mean
it
and
i
meant
it
it
you
she
said
who
care
how
do
you
make
that
out
he
really
wanted
to
know
he
really
wanted
if
it
were
possible
to
understand
her
i
make
it
out
this
way
here
have
i
been
through
the
adventure
and
the
experience
of
my
life
i
was
in
the
thick
of
the
big
raid
i
was
four
weeks
shut
up
in
a
prison
cell
and
you
do
care
you
not
interested
you
never
said
to
yourself
was
in
the
big
raid
i
wonder
what
happened
to
her
or
in
prison
i
wonder
how
she
feeling
you
did
care
you
were
interested
if
it
had
happened
to
you
i
could
have
thought
of
anything
else
i
could
have
got
it
out
of
my
head
i
should
have
been
wondering
all
the
time
what
you
were
feeling
i
could
have
rested
till
i
knew
it
would
have
been
as
if
i
was
in
prison
myself
and
now
when
i
come
out
all
you
think
of
is
how
you
can
rag
and
score
off
me
she
was
sitting
beside
him
on
the
green
bank
of
the
lane
her
hands
were
clasped
round
her
knees
one
knickerbockered
knee
protruded
through
the
rent
in
her
skirt
she
stared
across
the
road
a
long
straight
stare
that
took
no
heed
of
what
she
saw
the
grey
road
and
the
green
bank
on
the
other
side
topped
by
its
hedge
of
trees
her
voice
sounded
quiet
in
the
quiet
lane
it
had
no
accent
of
or
reproach
it
was
as
if
she
were
making
statements
that
had
no
emotional
significance
whatever
she
did
not
mean
to
hurt
him
yet
every
word
cut
where
he
was
sorest
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
i
counted
the
days
the
minutes
till
i
could
tell
you
but
you
would
listen
you
do
want
to
hear
i
wo
listen
if
it
about
women
suffrage
and
i
do
want
to
hear
if
it
anything
awful
about
you
it
is
about
me
but
it
is
awful
that
what
i
want
to
tell
you
but
first
of
all
about
the
raid
i
did
mean
to
be
in
it
at
all
as
it
happens
i
meant
to
go
with
the
deputation
because
you
told
me
not
to
you
right
about
that
but
i
meant
to
turn
back
as
soon
as
the
police
stopped
us
because
i
hate
rows
with
the
police
and
because
i
do
believe
in
them
and
because
i
told
angela
blathwaite
i
going
in
with
her
crowd
any
way
you
see
she
called
me
a
coward
before
a
lot
of
people
and
said
i
funked
it
so
i
did
but
i
should
have
been
a
bigger
coward
if
i
gone
against
my
own
will
just
because
of
what
she
said
that
how
she
collars
heaps
of
women
they
adore
her
and
afraid
of
her
sometimes
they
lie
and
tell
her
they
going
in
when
their
moment
comes
knowing
perfectly
well
that
they
not
going
in
at
all
i
do
adore
her
and
i
not
afraid
of
her
and
i
did
lie
so
i
went
at
the
tail
of
the
deputation
where
i
could
slip
out
when
the
row
began
i
swear
i
did
mean
to
be
in
it
i
funked
it
far
too
much
i
did
mind
the
police
and
i
did
mind
the
crowd
but
i
funked
being
with
the
women
when
i
saw
their
faces
you
world
have
funked
it
and
anyhow
i
do
like
doing
things
in
a
beastly
body
ugh
and
then
they
began
moving
the
police
tried
to
stop
them
and
the
crowd
tried
the
crowd
began
jeering
at
them
and
still
they
moved
and
the
mounted
police
horses
got
excited
and
danced
about
and
reared
a
bit
and
the
crowd
was
in
a
funk
then
and
barged
into
the
women
that
was
rather
awful
i
could
have
got
away
then
if
i
chosen
there
was
a
man
close
to
me
all
the
time
who
kept
making
spaces
for
me
and
telling
me
to
slip
through
i
was
just
going
to
when
a
woman
fell
somewhere
in
the
front
of
the
deputation
where
the
police
were
getting
nasty
then
i
had
to
stay
i
had
to
go
on
with
them
i
swear
i
was
excited
or
carried
away
in
the
least
two
women
near
me
were
yelling
at
the
police
i
hated
them
but
i
felt
i
be
an
utter
brute
if
i
left
them
and
got
off
safe
you
see
it
was
an
ugly
crowd
and
things
were
beginning
to
be
jolly
dangerous
and
i
funked
it
badly
only
the
first
minute
it
went
the
funk
i
mean
when
i
saw
the
woman
go
down
she
fell
sort
of
slanting
through
the
crowd
and
it
was
horrible
i
could
have
left
them
then
any
more
than
i
could
have
left
children
in
a
burning
house
i
thought
of
you
you
thought
of
me
yes
i
thought
of
you
how
you
have
hated
it
but
i
did
care
i
was
sort
of
boosted
up
above
caring
the
funk
had
all
gone
and
i
was
absolutely
happy
not
insanely
happy
like
some
of
the
other
women
but
quietly
comfily
happy
after
all
i
did
do
anything
you
have
minded
what
you
do
he
said
i
just
went
on
and
stood
still
and
refused
to
go
back
i
stuck
my
hands
in
my
pockets
so
that
i
should
let
out
at
a
policeman
or
anything
i
knew
you
would
like
i
may
have
pushed
a
bit
now
and
then
with
my
shoulders
and
my
elbows
i
ca
remember
but
i
did
make
one
sound
i
was
perfectly
and
perfectly
dignified
i
suppose
you
you
have
got
a
hat
on
it
did
off
i
it
off
and
threw
it
to
the
crowd
when
the
row
began
it
does
matter
about
your
hair
coming
down
if
you
have
got
a
hat
on
but
if
your
hair
down
and
your
hat
bashed
in
and
all
crooked
you
look
a
perfect
idiot
it
was
a
bad
fight
you
know
women
to
i
do
know
how
many
policemen
and
the
front
ones
got
right
into
the
doorway
of
stephen
that
was
where
they
copped
me
but
that
is
the
end
of
it
the
fight
was
only
the
first
part
of
the
adventure
the
wonderful
thing
was
what
happened
afterwards
in
prison
i
did
think
i
really
prison
that
was
another
thing
i
funked
i
heard
such
awful
things
about
it
about
the
dirt
you
know
and
there
was
any
dirt
in
my
cell
anyhow
and
after
the
crowds
of
women
after
the
meetings
and
the
speeches
the
endless
talking
and
the
boredom
that
cell
was
like
heaven
thank
god
it
always
solitary
confinement
the
government
know
that
if
they
want
to
make
prison
a
deterrent
they
shut
us
up
together
you
wo
give
the
home
secretary
the
tip
will
you
but
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
was
something
bigger
something
tremendous
you
not
believe
this
part
of
it
but
i
was
absolutely
happy
in
that
cell
it
was
a
sort
of
unexcited
happiness
i
not
a
bit
religious
but
i
how
the
nuns
feel
in
their
cells
when
they
given
up
everything
and
shut
themselves
up
with
god
the
cell
was
like
a
convent
cell
you
know
as
narrow
as
that
bit
of
shadow
there
is
and
it
had
nice
walls
and
a
in
the
corner
and
a
window
high
high
up
there
ought
to
have
been
a
crucifix
on
the
wall
above
the
but
there
was
a
crucifix
there
was
only
a
shiny
black
bible
on
the
chair
really
frank
if
you
to
be
shut
up
for
a
month
with
just
one
book
it
had
better
be
the
bible
isaiah
ripping
i
can
remember
heaps
of
it
the
habitation
of
jackals
where
they
lay
shall
be
grass
with
reeds
and
rushes
and
an
highway
shall
be
there
the
redeemed
shall
walk
there
and
the
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
with
singing
into
zion
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
they
shall
mount
up
with
wings
as
eagles
they
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
they
shall
walk
and
not
faint
i
used
to
read
like
anything
and
i
thought
of
things
they
sort
of
came
to
me
that
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
the
things
that
came
to
me
were
so
much
bigger
than
the
thing
i
went
in
for
i
could
see
all
along
we
were
going
to
get
it
that
way
and
i
knew
we
going
to
get
it
some
other
way
i
do
in
the
least
know
how
but
it
be
some
big
tremendous
way
that
make
all
this
fighting
and
fussing
seem
the
rottenest
game
that
was
one
of
the
things
i
used
to
think
about
then
he
said
you
given
it
up
you
corning
out
of
it
she
looked
at
him
keenly
are
those
still
your
conditions
he
hesitated
one
second
before
he
answered
firmly
yes
those
are
still
my
conditions
you
still
wo
agree
to
them
i
still
wo
agree
it
no
use
talking
about
it
you
do
believe
in
freedom
we
incompatible
we
do
stand
for
the
same
ideals
oh
lord
what
that
matter
it
matters
most
awfully
i
should
have
thought
said
drayton
it
would
have
mattered
more
if
i
had
revolting
manners
or
an
impediment
in
my
speech
or
something
it
would
well
you
seem
to
have
thought
about
a
lot
of
things
did
you
ever
once
think
about
me
dorothy
yes
i
did
have
you
ever
read
the
psalms
there
a
jolly
one
that
begins
be
the
lord
my
strength
which
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
and
my
fingers
to
fight
i
used
to
think
of
you
when
i
read
that
i
thought
of
you
a
lot
that
what
i
was
coming
to
it
was
the
queerest
thing
of
all
everything
seemed
ended
when
i
went
to
prison
i
knew
you
would
care
for
me
after
what
i
done
you
must
really
listen
to
this
frank
i
knew
you
could
and
would
marry
me
and
it
somehow
did
matter
what
i
got
hold
of
was
bigger
than
that
i
knew
that
all
this
suffrage
business
was
only
a
part
of
it
a
small
ridiculous
part
i
sort
of
saw
the
redeemed
of
the
lord
they
were
men
as
well
as
women
frank
and
they
were
all
free
they
were
all
free
because
they
were
redeemed
and
the
funny
thing
was
that
you
were
part
of
it
you
were
mixed
up
in
the
whole
queer
tremendous
business
everything
was
ended
and
everything
was
begun
so
that
i
knew
you
understood
even
when
you
did
understand
it
was
really
as
if
i
got
you
tight
somehow
and
i
knew
you
could
go
even
when
you
gone
and
yet
you
do
see
that
it
a
crime
to
force
me
to
go
i
see
that
it
would
be
a
worse
crime
to
force
you
to
stay
if
you
mean
going
what
time
is
it
a
quarter
to
eight
and
i
got
to
go
home
and
have
a
bath
whatever
you
do
do
make
me
late
for
that
infernal
banquet
you
going
to
drive
me
there
i
going
to
drive
you
there
but
i
not
going
in
with
you
poor
darling
did
i
ask
you
to
go
in
he
drove
her
back
to
her
father
house
she
came
out
of
it
burnished
and
beautiful
dressed
in
clean
white
linen
with
the
broad
red
white
and
blue
tricolour
of
the
women
franchise
union
slanting
across
her
breast
he
drove
her
to
the
banquet
of
the
prisoners
to
the
imperial
hotel
kingsway
they
went
in
silence
for
their
hearts
ached
too
much
for
speaking
but
in
dorothy
heart
above
the
aching
there
was
that
queer
exaltation
that
had
sustained
her
in
prison
he
left
her
at
the
entrance
of
the
hotel
where
michael
and
nicholas
waited
to
receive
her
michael
and
nicholas
went
in
with
her
to
the
banquet
they
hated
it
but
they
went
in
veronica
was
with
them
she
too
wore
a
white
frock
with
red
white
and
blue
ribbons
drayton
a
bit
of
a
rotter
michael
said
not
to
see
you
through
how
can
he
when
he
feels
like
that
about
it
as
if
we
did
feel
three
hundred
and
thirty
women
and
twenty
men
waited
in
the
banquet
hall
to
receive
the
prisoners
the
high
galleries
were
festooned
with
the
red
white
and
blue
of
the
women
franchise
union
and
hung
with
flags
and
blazoned
banners
the
silk
standards
and
the
emblems
of
the
women
suffrage
leagues
and
societies
supported
by
their
tall
poles
stood
ranged
along
three
walls
they
covered
the
sham
porphyry
with
gorgeous
and
heroic
colours
purple
and
blue
and
sapphire
blue
and
royal
blue
black
white
and
gold
vivid
green
pure
gold
pure
white
orange
and
scarlet
and
magenta
from
the
high
table
under
the
windows
streamed
seven
dependent
tables
decorated
with
nosegays
of
red
white
and
blue
flowers
in
the
centre
of
the
high
table
three
draped
with
the
tricolour
were
set
like
three
thrones
for
the
three
leaders
they
were
flanked
by
nine
other
chairs
on
the
right
and
nine
on
the
left
for
the
eighteen
other
prisoners
there
was
a
slight
rustling
sound
at
the
side
door
leading
to
the
high
table
it
was
followed
by
a
thicker
and
more
prolonged
sound
of
rustling
as
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
turned
in
their
places
the
prisoners
came
in
a
great
surge
of
white
spotted
with
red
and
blue
heaved
itself
up
in
the
hall
to
meet
them
as
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
rose
to
their
feet
and
from
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
there
went
up
a
strange
a
savage
and
a
piercing
collective
sound
where
a
clear
tinkling
as
of
glass
or
thin
metal
and
a
tearing
as
of
silk
and
a
crying
as
of
children
and
of
small
animals
were
held
together
by
ringing
vibrating
overtopping
tones
as
of
violins
playing
in
the
treble
and
now
a
woman
voice
started
off
on
its
own
note
and
tore
the
delicate
tissue
of
this
sound
with
a
solitary
scream
and
now
a
man
voice
filled
up
a
pause
in
the
shrill
hurrahing
with
a
solitary
boom
to
dorothea
in
her
triumphal
seat
at
angela
blathwaite
right
hand
to
michael
and
nicholas
and
veronica
in
their
places
among
the
crowd
that
collective
sound
was
frightful
from
her
high
place
dorothea
could
see
michael
and
nicholas
one
on
each
side
of
veronica
just
below
her
at
the
same
table
facing
them
she
saw
her
three
aunts
louie
emmeline
and
edith
it
was
from
emmeline
that
those
lacerating
screams
arose
the
breakfast
and
the
speeches
of
the
prisoners
were
over
the
crowd
was
on
its
feet
again
and
the
prisoners
had
risen
in
their
high
places
out
of
the
three
hundred
and
two
hundred
and
women
and
seven
men
were
singing
the
marching
song
of
the
militant
women
shoulder
to
shoulder
breast
to
breast
our
army
moves
from
east
to
west
follow
on
follow
on
with
flag
and
sword
from
south
and
north
the
sounding
shining
hosts
go
forth
follow
on
follow
on
do
you
not
bear
our
marching
feet
from
door
to
door
from
street
to
street
follow
on
follow
on
dorothea
was
fascinated
and
horrified
by
the
singing
swaying
excited
crowd
her
three
aunts
fascinated
her
they
were
all
singing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
aunt
louie
stood
up
straight
and
rigid
she
sang
from
the
back
of
her
throat
through
a
mouth
not
quite
sufficiently
open
she
sang
with
a
grim
heroic
determination
to
sing
whatever
it
might
cost
her
and
other
people
aunt
edie
sang
inaudibly
her
thin
shallow
voice
doing
its
utmost
was
overpowered
by
the
collective
song
aunt
emmeline
sang
shrill
and
loud
her
body
rocked
slightly
to
the
rhythm
of
a
fantastic
march
with
one
large
long
hand
raised
she
beat
the
measure
of
the
music
her
head
was
thrown
back
and
on
her
face
there
was
a
look
of
ecstasy
of
a
holy
rapture
exalted
half
savage
not
quite
sane
dorothea
was
fascinated
and
horrified
by
aunt
emmeline
the
singing
had
threatened
her
when
it
began
so
that
she
felt
again
her
old
terror
of
the
collective
soul
its
massed
emotion
threatened
her
she
longed
for
her
for
its
hardness
its
nakedness
its
quiet
its
visionary
peace
she
tried
to
remember
her
soul
in
its
danger
tried
to
get
back
there
but
the
soul
of
the
crowd
in
the
hail
below
her
swelled
and
heaved
itself
towards
her
drawn
by
the
vortex
she
felt
the
rushing
of
the
whirlwind
it
sucked
at
her
breath
the
vortex
was
drawing
her
too
the
powerful
abominable
thing
almost
got
her
the
sight
of
emmeline
saved
her
she
might
have
been
singing
and
swaying
too
carried
away
in
the
same
awful
ecstasy
if
she
had
not
seen
emmeline
by
looking
at
emmeline
she
saved
her
soul
it
stood
firm
again
she
was
clear
and
hard
and
sane
she
could
look
away
from
emmeline
now
she
saw
her
brothers
michael
and
nicholas
michael
soul
was
the
prey
of
its
terror
of
the
the
shrill
voices
fine
as
whipcord
and
sharp
as
needles
tortured
him
michael
looked
beautiful
in
his
martyrdom
his
fair
handsome
face
was
set
clear
and
hard
his
yellow
hair
with
its
hard
edges
fitted
his
head
like
a
cap
of
solid
polished
metal
weariness
and
disgust
made
a
sort
of
cloud
over
his
light
green
eyes
when
nicky
looked
at
him
nicky
face
twitched
and
twinkled
but
he
hated
it
almost
as
much
as
michael
hated
it
she
thought
of
michael
and
nicholas
they
hated
it
and
yet
they
stuck
it
out
they
would
go
back
on
her
she
and
lady
victoria
threlfall
were
to
march
on
foot
before
the
car
of
victory
from
blackfriars
bridge
along
the
embankment
through
trafalgar
square
and
pall
mall
and
piccadilly
to
hyde
park
corner
and
michael
and
nicholas
would
march
beside
them
to
hold
up
the
poles
of
the
standard
which
after
all
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
carry
she
thought
of
drayton
who
had
not
stuck
it
out
and
at
the
same
time
she
thought
of
the
things
that
had
come
to
her
in
her
prison
cell
she
had
told
him
the
most
real
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
her
and
he
had
not
listened
he
had
not
cared
michael
would
have
listened
michael
would
have
cared
intensely
she
thought
am
not
come
to
bring
peace
but
a
sword
the
sword
was
between
her
and
her
lover
she
had
given
him
up
she
had
chosen
not
between
him
and
the
vortex
but
between
him
and
her
vision
which
was
more
than
either
of
them
or
than
all
this
she
looked
at
rosalind
and
maud
blackadder
who
sang
violently
in
the
hall
below
her
she
had
chosen
freedom
she
had
given
up
her
lover
she
wondered
whether
rosalind
or
the
blackadder
girl
could
have
done
as
much
supposing
they
had
had
a
choice
then
she
looked
at
veronica
veronica
was
standing
between
michael
and
nicholas
she
was
slender
and
beautiful
and
pure
like
some
sacrificial
virgin
presently
she
would
be
marching
in
the
procession
she
would
carry
a
thin
tall
pole
with
a
round
olive
wreath
on
the
top
of
it
and
a
white
dove
sitting
in
the
ring
of
the
olive
wreath
and
she
would
look
as
if
she
was
not
in
the
procession
but
in
another
place
when
dorothea
looked
at
her
she
was
lifted
up
above
the
insane
ecstasy
and
the
tumult
of
the
her
soul
and
the
soul
of
veronica
went
alone
in
utter
freedom
follow
on
follow
on
for
faith
our
spear
and
hope
our
sword
and
love
our
mighty
follow
on
follow
on
and
justice
is
our
flag
unfurled
the
flaming
flag
that
sweeps
the
world
follow
on
follow
on
and
freedom
is
our
for
freedom
we
will
fight
and
die
follow
on
follow
on
the
procession
was
over
a
mile
long
it
stretched
all
along
the
embankment
from
blackfriar
bridge
to
westminster
the
car
of
victory
covered
with
the
tricolour
and
the
bodyguard
on
thirteen
white
horses
were
drawn
up
beside
needle
and
the
sphinxes
before
the
car
of
victory
from
the
western
sphinx
to
northumberland
avenue
were
the
long
regiments
of
the
unions
and
societies
and
leagues
of
the
trades
and
the
professions
and
the
arts
carrying
their
banners
the
purple
and
the
blue
the
black
white
and
gold
the
green
the
orange
and
the
scarlet
and
magenta
behind
the
car
of
victory
came
the
eighteen
prisoners
with
lady
victoria
threlfall
and
dorothea
at
their
head
under
the
immense
tricolour
standard
that
michael
and
nicholas
carried
for
them
behind
the
prisoners
closing
the
procession
was
a
double
line
of
young
girls
dressed
in
white
with
tricolour
ribbons
each
carrying
a
pole
with
the
olive
wreath
and
dove
symbolizing
with
the
obviousness
of
extreme
innocence
the
peace
that
follows
victory
they
were
led
by
veronica
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
been
chosen
to
lead
them
because
of
her
youth
and
her
processional
hieratic
beauty
she
thought
that
the
union
had
bestowed
this
honour
on
her
because
she
belonged
to
dorothea
from
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
procession
she
could
see
the
big
red
white
and
blue
standard
held
high
above
dorothea
and
lady
victoria
threlfall
she
knew
how
they
would
look
lady
victoria
white
and
tense
would
go
like
a
saint
and
a
martyr
in
exaltation
hardly
knowing
where
she
was
or
what
she
did
and
dorothea
would
go
in
pride
and
in
disdain
for
the
proceedings
in
which
her
honour
forced
her
to
take
part
she
would
have
an
awful
knowledge
of
what
she
was
doing
and
of
where
she
was
she
would
drink
every
drop
of
the
dreadful
cup
she
had
poured
out
for
herself
hating
it
last
night
veronica
had
thought
that
she
too
would
hate
it
she
thought
that
she
would
rather
die
than
march
in
the
procession
but
she
did
not
hate
it
or
her
part
in
it
the
thing
was
too
beautiful
and
too
big
to
hate
and
her
part
in
it
was
too
little
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
procession
or
of
the
soul
of
the
procession
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
thick
crowd
on
the
pavements
pressing
closer
and
closer
pushed
back
continually
by
the
police
her
soul
was
by
itself
like
dorothea
soul
it
went
apart
from
the
soul
of
the
crowd
and
the
soul
of
the
procession
only
it
was
not
proud
it
was
simply
happy
the
band
had
not
yet
begun
to
play
but
already
she
heard
the
music
sounding
in
her
brain
her
feet
felt
the
rhythm
of
the
march
somewhere
on
in
front
the
policemen
made
gestures
of
release
and
the
whole
procession
began
to
move
it
marched
to
an
unheard
music
to
the
rhythm
that
was
in
veronica
brain
they
went
through
what
were
once
streets
between
walls
of
houses
and
were
now
broad
lanes
between
thick
walls
of
people
the
visible
aspect
of
things
was
slightly
changed
slightly
distorted
the
houses
stood
farther
back
behind
the
walls
of
people
they
were
hung
with
people
a
swarm
of
people
clung
like
bees
to
the
house
walls
all
these
people
were
fixed
where
they
stood
or
hung
in
a
still
and
stationary
world
the
procession
was
the
only
thing
that
moved
she
had
a
vague
perception
that
the
crowd
was
friendly
a
mounted
policeman
rode
at
her
side
when
they
halted
at
the
he
looked
down
at
veronica
with
an
amused
and
benign
expression
she
had
a
vague
perception
that
the
policeman
was
friendly
everything
seemed
to
her
vague
and
far
off
only
now
and
then
it
struck
her
as
odd
that
a
revolutionary
procession
should
be
allowed
to
fill
the
streets
of
a
great
capital
and
that
a
body
of
the
same
police
that
arrested
the
insurgents
should
go
with
it
to
protect
them
to
clear
their
triumphal
way
before
them
holding
up
the
entire
traffic
of
great
thoroughfares
that
their
bands
and
their
banners
and
their
regiments
should
go
through
she
said
to
herself
what
a
country
it
could
happen
in
germany
it
could
happen
in
france
or
anywhere
in
europe
or
america
it
could
only
happen
in
england
now
they
were
going
up
james
street
towards
piccadilly
the
band
was
playing
the
marseillaise
and
with
the
first
beat
of
the
drum
veronica
soul
came
down
from
its
place
and
took
part
in
the
procession
as
long
as
they
played
the
marseillaise
she
felt
that
she
could
march
with
the
procession
to
the
ends
of
the
world
she
could
march
into
battle
to
the
marseillaise
she
could
fight
to
that
music
and
die
the
women
behind
her
were
singing
under
their
breath
they
sang
the
words
of
the
women
marseillaise
and
veronica
marching
in
front
of
them
by
herself
sang
another
song
she
sang
the
marseillaise
of
heine
and
of
schumann
reitet

the
front
of
the
procession
lifted
as
it
went
up
tyburn
hill
veronica
could
not
see
michael
and
nicholas
but
she
knew
that
they
were
there
she
knew
it
by
the
unusual
steadiness
of
the
standard
that
they
carried
far
away
westwards
in
the
middle
and
front
of
the
procession
the
purple
and
the
blue
the
gold
and
white
the
green
the
scarlet
and
orange
and
magenta
standards
rocked
and
staggered
they
bent
forwards
they
were
flung
backwards
as
the
west
wind
took
them
but
the
red
white
and
blue
standard
that
michael
and
nicholas
carried
went
before
her
steady
and
straight
and
high
and
veronica
followed
carrying
her
thin
tall
pole
with
the
olive
wreath
on
the
top
of
it
and
the
white
dove
sitting
in
the
ring
of
the
wreath
she
went
with
the
music
of
schumann
and
heine
sounding
in
her
soul
xvii
another
year
passed
frances
was
afraid
for
michael
now
michael
was
being
drawn
in
because
of
his
strange
thoughts
he
was
the
one
of
all
her
children
who
had
most
hidden
himself
from
her
who
would
perhaps
hide
himself
from
her
to
the
very
end
nicholas
had
settled
down
he
had
left
the
morss
company
and
gone
into
his
father
business
for
a
while
to
see
whether
he
could
stand
it
john
was
going
into
the
business
too
when
he
left
oxford
john
was
even
looking
forward
to
his
partnership
in
what
he
called
the
pater
old
he
said
you
wait
till
i
get
my
hand
well
in
wo
we
make
it
rip
john
was
safe
you
could
depend
on
him
to
keep
out
of
trouble
he
had
no
genius
for
adventure
he
would
never
strike
out
for
himself
any
strange
or
dangerous
line
he
had
settled
down
at
cheltenham
he
had
settled
down
at
oxford
and
dorothea
had
settled
down
the
women
franchise
union
was
now
in
the
full
whirl
of
its
revolution
under
the
inspiring
leadership
of
the
blathwaites
it
ran
riot
up
and
down
the
country
it
smashed
windows
it
hurled
stone
bottles
into
the
motor
cars
of
cabinet
ministers
it
poured
treacle
into
it
invaded
the
house
of
commons
by
the
in
barges
from
which
women
armed
with
megaphones
demanded
the
vote
from
infamous
legislators
drinking
tea
on
the
terrace
it
went
up
in
balloons
and
showered
down
propaganda
on
the
city
now
and
then
just
to
show
what
violence
it
could
accomplish
if
it
liked
it
burned
down
a
house
or
two
in
a
pure
and
consecrated
ecstasy
of
feminism
it
was
bringing
to
perfection
its
last
great
tactical
manoeuvre
the
massed
raid
followed
by
the
in
prison
and
it
was
considering
seriously
the
very
painful
but
possible
necessity
of
interfering
with
british
sport
say
the
eton
and
harrow
match
at
lord
in
some
drastic
and
terrifying
way
that
would
bring
the
men
of
england
to
their
senses
and
dorothea
soul
had
swung
away
from
the
sweep
of
the
whirlwind
it
would
never
suck
her
in
she
worked
now
in
the
office
of
the
social
reform
union
and
wrote
reconstructive
articles
for
new
on
economics
and
the
marriage
laws
frances
was
not
afraid
for
her
daughter
she
knew
that
the
revolution
was
all
in
dorothea
brain
when
she
said
that
michael
was
being
drawn
in
she
meant
that
he
was
being
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
revolutionary
art
and
since
frances
confused
this
movement
with
the
movements
of
phyllis
desmond
she
judged
it
to
be
terrible
she
understood
from
michael
that
it
was
vortex
the
only
one
that
really
mattered
and
the
only
one
that
would
ever
do
anything
and
michael
was
not
only
in
it
he
was
in
it
with
lawrence
stephen
though
frances
knew
now
that
lawrence
stephen
had
plans
for
michael
she
did
not
realize
that
they
depended
much
more
on
michael
himself
than
on
him
stephen
had
said
that
if
michael
was
good
enough
he
meant
to
help
him
if
his
poems
amounted
to
anything
he
would
publish
them
in
his
if
any
book
of
michael
poems
amounted
to
anything
he
would
give
a
whole
article
to
that
book
in
his
if
michael
prose
should
ever
amount
to
anything
he
would
give
him
regular
work
on
the
in
michael
harrison
was
the
most
promising
of
the
revolutionary
young
men
who
surrounded
lawrence
stephen
and
his
poems
were
beginning
to
appear
one
after
another
in
the
he
had
brought
out
a
volume
of
his
experiments
in
the
spring
of
that
year
they
were
better
than
those
that
réveillaud
had
approved
of
two
years
ago
and
lawrence
stephen
had
praised
them
in
the
lawrence
stephen
was
the
only
editor
out
of
ireland
as
he
said
who
would
have
had
the
courage
either
to
publish
them
or
to
praise
them
and
when
frances
realized
michael
dependence
on
lawrence
stephen
she
was
afraid
you
would
be
my
dear
if
you
knew
larry
vera
said
for
frances
still
refused
to
recognize
the
man
who
had
taken
ferdinand
cameron
place
lawrence
stephen
was
one
of
those
nationalist
irishmen
who
love
ireland
with
a
passion
that
satisfies
neither
the
lover
nor
the
beloved
it
was
a
pure
and
holy
passion
a
passion
so
entirely
of
the
spirit
as
to
be
compatible
with
permanent
bodily
absence
from
its
object
body
had
lived
at
ease
in
england
a
country
that
he
declared
his
spirit
hated
ever
since
he
had
been
old
enough
to
choose
a
habitation
for
himself
he
justified
his
predilection
on
three
grounds
ireland
had
been
taken
from
him
ireland
had
been
so
ruined
and
raped
by
the
scotch
and
the
english
that
nothing
but
the
soul
of
ireland
was
left
for
irishmen
to
love
he
could
work
and
fight
for
ireland
better
in
london
than
in
dublin
and
again
the
irishman
in
england
can
make
havoc
in
his
turn
he
can
harry
the
english
he
can
spite
and
irritate
and
triumph
and
get
his
own
back
in
a
thousand
ways
living
in
england
he
would
be
a
thorn
in
england
side
and
all
this
meant
that
there
was
no
place
in
ireland
for
a
man
of
his
talents
and
his
temperament
his
enemies
called
him
an
opportunist
but
he
was
a
opportunist
gone
wrong
abandoned
to
an
obstinate
idealism
one
of
those
damned
and
solitary
souls
that
only
the
north
of
ireland
produces
in
perfection
for
the
protestantism
of
ulster
breeds
rebels
like
no
other
rebels
on
earth
rebels
as
strong
and
obstinate
and
canny
as
itself
before
he
was
stephen
had
revolted
against
the
material
comfort
and
the
spiritual
tyranny
of
his
father
house
he
was
the
of
an
immigrant
lancashire
cotton
spinner
settled
in
belfast
his
western
irish
blood
was
steeled
with
this
mixture
and
braced
and
embittered
with
the
scottish
blood
of
antrim
where
his
people
married
therefore
if
he
had
chosen
one
career
and
stuck
to
it
he
would
have
been
formidable
but
one
career
alone
did
not
suffice
for
his
inexhaustible
energies
as
a
fisher
of
opportunities
he
drew
with
too
wide
a
net
and
in
too
many
waters
he
had
tried
parliamentary
politics
and
failed
because
no
party
trusted
him
least
of
all
his
own
and
yet
few
men
were
more
trustworthy
he
turned
his
back
on
the
house
of
commons
and
took
to
journalism
as
a
journalistic
politician
he
ran
nationalism
for
ireland
and
socialism
for
england
neither
nationalists
nor
socialists
believed
in
him
yet
few
men
were
more
worthy
of
belief
in
literature
he
had
distinguished
himself
as
a
poet
a
playwright
a
novelist
and
an
essayist
he
did
everything
so
well
that
he
was
supposed
not
to
do
anything
quite
well
enough
because
of
his
politics
other
men
of
letters
suspected
his
artistic
sincerity
yet
few
artists
were
more
sincere
his
very
distinction
was
unsatisfying
without
any
of
the
qualities
that
make
even
a
minor
statesman
he
was
so
far
contaminated
by
politics
as
to
be
spoiled
for
the
highest
purposes
of
art
yet
there
was
no
sense
in
which
he
had
achieved
popularity
everywhere
he
went
he
was
an
alien
and
suspected
do
what
he
would
he
fell
between
two
countries
and
two
courses
ireland
had
cast
him
out
and
england
would
none
of
him
he
hated
catholicism
and
protestantism
alike
and
protestants
and
catholics
alike
disowned
him
to
every
church
and
every
sect
he
was
a
free
thinker
destitute
of
all
religion
yet
few
men
were
more
religious
his
enemies
called
him
a
turner
and
a
twister
yet
on
any
one
of
his
lines
no
man
ever
steered
a
straighter
course
a
capacity
for
turning
and
twisting
might
have
saved
him
it
would
at
any
rate
have
made
him
more
intelligible
as
it
was
he
presented
to
two
countries
the
disconcerting
spectacle
of
a
object
moving
with
violence
in
a
dead
straight
line
he
moved
so
fast
that
to
a
stationary
he
was
gone
before
one
angle
of
him
had
been
apprehended
it
was
for
other
people
to
turn
and
twist
if
any
one
of
them
was
to
get
a
complete
view
of
the
amazing
man
but
taken
all
round
he
passed
for
a
man
of
hard
wit
and
suspicious
brilliance
and
he
belonged
to
no
generation
in
he
was
not
yet
forty
too
old
to
count
among
the
young
men
and
yet
too
young
for
men
of
his
own
age
so
that
in
all
ireland
and
all
england
you
could
not
have
found
a
lonelier
man
the
same
queer
doom
pursued
him
in
the
most
private
and
sacred
relations
of
his
life
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
was
married
to
vera
harrison
and
yet
he
was
not
married
he
was
neither
bound
nor
free
all
this
had
made
him
sorrowful
and
bitter
and
to
add
to
his
sorrowfulness
and
bitterness
he
had
something
of
the
celt
spiritual
abhorrence
of
the
flesh
and
though
he
loved
vera
after
his
manner
there
were
moments
when
vera
capacity
for
everlasting
passion
left
him
tired
and
bored
and
cold
all
his
life
passions
had
been
at
the
service
of
ideas
all
his
life
he
had
looked
for
some
great
experience
some
great
satisfaction
and
consummation
and
he
had
not
found
it
in
with
half
his
life
behind
him
the
opportunist
was
still
waiting
for
his
supreme
opportunity
meanwhile
his
enemies
said
of
him
that
he
snatched
but
he
did
not
snatch
the
eyes
of
his
idealism
were
fixed
too
steadily
on
a
visionary
future
he
merely
tried
with
a
bored
and
weary
gesture
to
waylay
the
passing
moment
while
he
waited
he
had
put
his
political
failure
behind
him
and
said
i
will
be
judged
as
an
artist
or
not
at
all
they
judged
him
accordingly
and
their
judgment
was
wrong
there
was
not
the
least
resemblance
between
lawrence
stephen
as
he
was
in
himself
and
lawrence
stephen
as
he
appeared
to
the
generation
just
behind
him
to
conservatives
he
passed
for
the
leader
of
the
revolution
in
contemporary
art
and
yet
the
revolution
in
contemporary
art
was
happening
without
him
he
was
not
the
primal
energy
in
the
movement
of
the
vortex
in
his
primal
energies
were
spent
and
he
was
trusting
to
the
movement
of
the
vortex
to
carry
him
a
little
farther
than
he
could
have
gone
by
his
own
impetus
he
was
attracted
to
the
young
men
of
the
vortex
because
they
were
not
of
the
generation
that
had
rejected
him
and
because
he
hoped
thus
to
prolong
indefinitely
his
own
youth
they
were
attracted
to
him
because
of
his
solitary
distinction
his
comparative
poverty
and
his
unpopularity
a
prosperous
stephen
would
have
revolted
them
he
gave
the
revolutionaries
the
shelter
of
his
the
support
of
his
name
and
the
benefit
of
his
bored
and
wearied
criticism
they
brought
him
in
return
a
certain
homage
founded
on
his
admirable
appreciation
of
their
merits
and
tempered
by
their
sense
of
his
dealings
with
the
past
they
abominated
stephen
is
a
bigot
said
young
morton
ellis
he
believes
in
swinburne
stephen
smiled
at
him
in
bored
and
weary
tolerance
he
believed
in
too
many
things
for
his
peace
of
mind
he
knew
that
the
young
men
distrusted
him
because
of
his
beliefs
and
because
of
his
dealings
with
the
past
because
he
refused
to
destroy
the
old
gods
when
he
made
place
for
the
new
young
morton
ellis
lay
stretched
out
at
his
ease
on
the
couch
in
stephen
study
he
blinked
and
twitched
as
he
looked
up
at
his
host
with
half
irritated
half
affable
affection
the
young
men
came
and
went
at
their
ease
in
and
out
of
that
house
in
john
wood
which
lawrence
stephen
shared
with
vera
harrison
they
were
at
home
there
their
books
stood
in
his
bookcase
they
laid
their
manuscripts
on
his
writing
table
and
left
them
there
they
claimed
his
empty
spaces
for
the
hanging
of
their
pictures
yet
unsold
every
friday
evening
they
met
together
in
the
long
low
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
they
talked
every
friday
evening
michael
left
his
father
house
to
meet
them
there
and
to
listen
and
to
talk
round
and
about
morton
ellis
the
young
poet
were
austen
mitchell
the
young
painter
and
paul
the
young
sculptor
and
george
wadham
the
last
and
youngest
of
morton
ellis
disciples
lawrence
stephen
stood
among
them
like
an
austere
guest
in
some
rendezvous
of
violent
youth
or
like
the
priest
of
some
romantic
religion
that
he
has
blasphemed
yet
not
quite
abjured
he
was
lean
and
dark
and
shaven
his
black
hair
hung
forward
in
two
masses
smooth
and
straight
and
square
he
had
sorrowful
bitter
eyes
and
a
bitter
sorrowful
mouth
the
long
irish
upper
lip
fine
and
hard
drawn
while
the
lower
lip
quivered
incongruously
pouted
and
protested
and
recanted
was
sceptical
and
sensitive
and
tender
his
short
high
nose
had
wide
yet
fastidious
nostrils
it
was
at
this
figure
that
morton
ellis
continued
to
gaze
with
affability
and
irritation
it
was
this
figure
that
vera
eyes
followed
with
anxious
restless
passion
as
if
she
felt
that
at
any
moment
he
might
escape
her
might
be
off
god
knew
where
lawrence
stephen
was
ill
at
ease
in
that
house
and
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
and
his
friends
i
believe
in
the
past
he
said
because
i
believe
in
the
future
i
want
continuity
therefore
i
believe
in
swinburne
and
i
believe
in
browning
and
in
tennyson
and
wordsworth
i
believe
in
keats
and
shelley
and
in
milton
but
i
do
not
believe
any
more
than
you
do
in
their
imitators
i
believe
in
destroying
their
imitators
i
do
not
believe
in
destroying
them
you
ca
destroy
their
imitators
unless
you
destroy
them
they
breed
the
disgusting
parasites
their
memories
harbour
them
like
a
stinking
suit
of
old
clothes
they
must
be
scrapped
and
burned
if
we
to
get
rid
of
the
stink
art
has
got
to
be
made
young
and
new
and
clean
there
is
any
disinfectant
that
do
the
trick
so
long
as
old
masters
are
to
as
masters
people
will
go
on
imitating
them
when
a
poet
ceases
to
be
a
poet
and
becomes
a
centre
of
corruption
he
must
go
michael
said
how
about
when
people
imitate
us
have
we
got
to
go
morton
ellis
looked
at
him
and
blinked
no
he
said
no
we
got
to
go
i
do
see
how
you
get
out
of
it
i
get
out
of
it
by
doing
things
that
ca
be
imitated
there
was
a
silence
in
which
everybody
thought
of
george
wadham
it
made
wadham
so
uncomfortable
that
he
had
to
break
it
i
say
how
about
shakespeare
he
said
nobody
so
far
imitated
shakespeare
any
more
than
they
have
in
imitating
me
there
was
another
silence
while
everybody
thought
of
morton
ellis
as
the
imitator
of
every
poetic
form
under
the
sun
except
the
forms
adopted
by
his
contemporaries
that
all
very
well
ellis
said
stephen
but
you
are
the
holy
ghost
coming
down
out
of
heaven
we
can
trace
your
sources
my
dear
stephen
i
never
said
i
was
the
holy
ghost
nobody
ever
does
come
down
out
of
heaven
you
trace
my
sources
thank
god
because
they
clean
i
have
gone
into
every
stream
that
swine
like
and
and
and
and
he
named
five
contemporary
distinctions
have
made
filthy
with
their
paddling
he
went
on
the
very
damnable
question
that
you
raised
harrison
is
absurd
you
believe
in
the
revolution
well
then
supposing
the
revolution
coming
you
need
suppose
it
because
it
come
we
the
revolution
the
revolution
means
that
we
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
past
in
the
future
no
artist
will
want
to
imitate
anybody
no
artist
will
be
allowed
to
exist
unless
he
prepared
to
be
buried
alive
or
burned
alive
rather
than
corrupt
the
younger
generation
with
the
processes
and
the
products
of
his
own
beastly
dissolution
that
why
violence
is
right
violenza
sorgi
balena
in
questo
cielo
sanguigno
stupra
le
albe
irrompi
come
incendio
nei
vesperi
fa
di
tutto
il
sereno
una
tempesta
fa
di
tutta
la
vita
una
bataglia
fa
con
tutte

there
no

violence

austen
mitchell
spoke
he
was
a
sallow
youth
with
a
broad
british
face
but
he
had
achieved
an
appearance
of
great
strangeness
and
distinction
by
letting
his
hair
grow
long
and
cultivating
two
beards
instead
of
one
violence
he
continued
is
not
a
means
it
an
end
energy
must
be
got
for
its
own
sake
if
you
want
to
generate
more
energy
instead
of
standing
still
the
difference
between
pastism
and
futurism
is
the
difference
between
statics
and
dynamics
futurist
art
is
simply
art
that
has
gone
on
that
has
left
off
being
static
and
become
dynamic
it
expresses
movement
owen
will
tell
you
better
than
i
can
why
it
expresses
movement
a
light
darted
from
the
corner
of
the
room
where
paul
had
curled
himself
up
his
eyes
flashed
like
the
eyes
of
a
young
wild
animal
roused
in
its
lair
paul
was
dark
and
soft
and
supple
at
a
little
distance
he
had
the
clumsy
grace
and
velvet
innocence
of
a
black
panther
half
cub
half
grown
the
tips
of
his
ears
the
corners
of
his
prominent
eyes
his
eyebrows
and
his
long
nostrils
tilted
slightly
upwards
and
backwards
under
his
slender
mournful
nose
his
restless
smile
showed
the
white
teeth
of
a
young
animal
above
this
primitive
savage
base
of
features
that
responded
incessantly
to
any
childish
provocation
the
intelligence
of
watched
in
his
calm
and
beautiful
forehead
and
in
his
eyes
he
said
it
expresses
movement
because
it
presents
objects
directly
as
cutting
across
many
planes
to
do
this
you
have
to
break
up
objects
into
the
lines
and
masses
that
compose
them
and
project
those
lines
and
masses
into
space
on
any
curve
at
any
angle
according
to
the
planes
you
mean
them
to
cross
otherwise
the
movements
you
mean
them
to
express
the
more
planes
intersected
the
more
movement
you
get
by
decomposing
figures
you
compose
movements
by
decomposing
groups
of
figures
you
compose
groups
of
movement
nothing
but
a
cinema
can
represent
objects
as
intact
and
as
at
the
same
time
moving
and
even
the
cinema
only
does
this
by
a
series
of
decompositions
so
minute
as
to
escape
the
eye
you
want
to
draw
a
or
the
traffic
at
hyde
park
corner
it
ca
be
done
unless
you
break
up
your
objects
as
mitchell
breaks
them
up
you
want
to
carve
figures
in
the
round
wrestling
or
dancing
it
ca
be
done
unless
you
dislocate
their
lines
and
masses
as
i
dislocate
them
so
as
to
throw
them
all
at
once
into
those
planes
that
the
intact
body
could
only
have
traversed
one
after
another
in
a
given
time
by
taking
time
into
account
as
well
as
space
we
produce
rhythm
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
stephen
the
dancing
faun
and
the
frieze
of
the
parthenon
express
movements
but
they
do
nothing
of
the
sort
they
express
movements
arrested
at
a
certain
point
they
are
supposed
to
represent
nature
but
they
do
not
even
do
that
because
arrested
motion
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
and
because
the
point
of
arrest
is
an
artificial
and
arbitrary
thing
your
medium
limits
you
you
have
to
choose
between
the
intact
body
which
is
stationary
and
the
broken
and
projected
bodies
which
are
in
movement
that
is
why
we
destroy
or
suppress
symmetry
in
the
figure
and
in
design
because
symmetry
is
perfect
balance
which
is
immobility
if
i
wanted
to
present
perfect
rest
i
should
do
it
by
an
absolute
symmetry
and
there
more
in
it
than
that
said
austen
mitchell
we
out
against
the
damnable
affectations
of
naturalism
and
humanism
if
i
draw
a
perfect
likeness
of
a
fat
pink
woman
i
got
a
fat
pink
woman
and
nothing
else
but
a
fat
pink
woman
and
a
fat
pink
woman
is
a
work
of
nature
not
a
work
of
art
and
i
lying
i
presenting
as
a
reality
what
is
only
an
appearance
the
better
the
likeness
the
bigger
the
lie
but
movement
and
rhythm
are
realities
not
appearances
when
i
present
rhythm
and
movement
i
done
something
i
made
reality
appear
he
went
on
to
unfold
a
scheme
for
restoring
vigour
to
the
exhausted
language
by
destroying
its
articulations
these
he
declared
to
be
purely
arbitrary
therefore
fatal
to
the
development
of
a
spontaneous
and
individual
style
by
breaking
up
the
rigid
ties
of
syntax
you
do
more
than
create
new
forms
of
prose
moving
in
perfect
freedom
you
deliver
the
creative
spirit
itself
from
the
abominable
contact
with
dead
ideas
association
fixed
and
eternalized
by
the
structure
of
the
language
is
the
tyranny
that
keeps
down
the
live
idea
we
got
to
restore
the
innocence
of
memory
as
gauguin
restored
the
innocence
of
the
eye
michael
noticed
that
the
talk
was
not
always
sustained
at
this
constructive
level
and
towards
twelve
it
dropped
and
broke
in
a
welter
of
vituperation
it
was
first
a
frenzied
assault
on
the
old
masters
a
storming
of
immortal
strongholds
a
tearing
and
scattering
of
the
wing
feathers
of
archangels
then
from
this
high
adventure
it
sank
to
a
perfunctory
skirmishing
among
living
eminences
over
forty
judged
by
reason
of
their
age
to
be
too
contemptible
for
an
attack
in
force
it
rallied
again
to
a
bombing
and
blasting
of
minute
ineptitudes
the
slaughter
of
swine
like
and
and
and
and
and
ended
in
a
furious
pursuit
of
a
volatile
young
poet
edward
rivers
who
had
escaped
by
sheer
levity
from
the
tug
of
the
vortex
and
was
setting
up
a
small
swirl
of
his
own
michael
was
with
the
revolutionaries
heart
and
soul
he
believed
in
morton
ellis
and
austen
mitchell
and
even
more
than
he
believed
in
lawrence
stephen
and
almost
as
much
as
he
believed
in
jules
réveillaud
they
stood
for
all
the
realities
and
all
the
ideas
and
all
the
accomplishments
to
which
he
himself
was
devoted
he
had
no
sort
of
qualms
about
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
the
inefficient
but
as
he
listened
to
these
voices
he
felt
again
his
old
horror
of
the
collective
soul
the
voices
spoke
with
a
terrible
unanimity
the
vortex
vortex
was
like
the
little
vortex
of
school
the
young
men
ellis
and
mitchell
and
belonged
to
a
herd
like
the
hunting
together
crying
together
saying
the
same
thing
their
very
revolt
against
the
old
masters
was
a
collective
and
not
an
individual
revolt
their
chase
was
hottest
when
their
quarry
was
one
of
the
pack
who
had
broken
through
and
got
away
they
hated
the
fugitive
solitary
private
soul
and
yet
it
was
only
as
private
souls
that
ellis
and
mitchell
and
counted
each
by
himself
did
good
things
each
if
he
had
the
courage
to
break
loose
and
go
by
himself
might
do
a
great
thing
some
day
even
george
wadham
might
do
something
if
he
could
get
away
from
ellis
and
the
rest
edward
rivers
had
had
courage
michael
thought
it
rivers
now
it
be
my
turn
next
but
he
had
a
great
longing
to
break
loose
and
get
away
he
thought
i
do
know
where
they
all
going
to
end
they
think
they
beginning
something
tremendous
but
i
ca
see
what
to
come
of
it
and
i
do
see
how
they
can
go
on
like
that
for
ever
i
see
what
coming
yet
something
must
come
ca
be
the
end
he
thought
their
movement
is
only
a
small
swirl
in
an
immense
vortex
it
may
suck
them
all
down
but
it
will
clear
the
air
they
will
have
helped
to
clear
it
he
thought
of
himself
going
on
free
from
the
whirl
of
the
vortex
and
of
his
work
as
enduring
standing
clear
and
hard
in
the
clean
air
part
iii
victory
xviii
it
was
july
a
month
remarkable
in
the
british
isles
because
of
the
fine
weather
and
the
disturbances
in
the
political
atmosphere
due
to
the
fine
weather
every
other
evening
in
that
july
anthony
harrison
reminded
his
family
that
fine
weather
is
favourable
to
politics
and
that
the
mere
of
sunstroke
is
enough
to
bring
out
the
striker
and
when
michael
asked
him
contentiously
what
the
weather
had
to
do
with
home
rule
he
answered
that
it
had
everything
to
do
with
it
by
increasing
parliamentary
wait
he
said
till
we
get
a
good
thunderstorm
you
see
how
long
the
strike
last
and
what
sir
edward
carson
has
to
say
to
redmond
then
anthony
kept
his
head
he
had
seen
strikes
before
and
he
knew
that
home
rule
had
never
been
a
part
of
practical
politics
and
never
would
be
and
michael
and
dorothea
laughed
at
him
they
had
their
own
views
about
the
home
rule
question
and
the
labor
question
and
they
could
have
told
anthony
what
the
answers
were
going
to
be
only
they
said
it
was
any
good
talking
to
father
when
he
got
an
idea
into
his
dear
old
head
it
stuck
there
now
on
mother
if
you
talked
to
her
long
enough
you
could
make
some
impression
you
could
get
ideas
into
her
head
and
you
could
get
them
out
frances
no
longer
preoccupied
with
the
care
of
young
children
had
time
for
the
affairs
of
the
nation
she
was
a
more
intelligent
woman
than
the
anthony
harrison
who
nineteen
years
ago
informed
herself
of
the
affairs
of
the
nation
from
a
rapid
skimming
of
the
in
the
last
four
years
the
affairs
of
the
nation
had
thrust
themselves
violently
upon
her
attention
she
had
even
realized
the
woman
suffrage
movement
as
a
vivid
and
vital
affair
since
dorothy
had
taken
part
in
the
fighting
and
had
gone
to
prison
frances
sitting
out
this
july
under
her
tree
of
heaven
with
the
had
a
sense
of
things
about
to
happen
if
other
things
happen
to
prevent
them
at
any
rate
she
had
no
longer
any
reason
to
complain
that
nothing
happened
it
was
the
home
rule
crisis
now
the
fact
that
england
and
ireland
were
on
the
edge
of
civil
war
was
brought
home
to
her
not
so
much
by
the
in
the
papers
as
by
the
publication
of
her
son
insurgent
poem
ireland
in
the
green
review
for
michael
had
not
grown
out
of
his
queer
idea
he
was
hardly
thirteen
when
he
had
said
that
civil
war
between
england
and
ireland
would
be
glorious
if
the
irish
won
and
he
was
saying
it
still
his
poem
was
the
green
flag
that
he
flew
in
the
face
of
his
family
and
of
his
country
neither
frances
nor
anthony
would
have
been
likely
to
forget
the
imminence
of
civil
war
only
that
they
did
really
believe
in
it
when
from
morning
till
night
michael
talked
and
wrote
of
nothing
else
in
this
michael
was
not
carried
away
by
collective
feeling
his
dream
of
ireland
freedom
was
a
secret
and
solitary
dream
nobody
he
knew
shared
it
but
lawrence
stephen
the
passion
he
brought
to
it
made
him
hot
and
restless
and
intense
frances
expressed
her
opinion
of
the
irish
crisis
when
she
said
i
wish
that
carson
man
would
mind
his
own
business
this
excitement
is
very
bad
for
michael
and
she
thanked
heaven
that
ireland
was
not
england
and
that
none
of
them
lived
there
if
there
was
civil
war
in
ireland
for
a
week
or
two
anthony
and
the
boys
would
be
out
of
it
frances
was
also
alive
to
the
war
between
capital
and
labour
there
was
indeed
something
very
intimate
and
personal
to
frances
in
this
particular
affair
of
the
nation
for
anthony
business
was
being
disagreeably
affected
by
the
strike
in
the
building
trade
so
much
so
that
anthony
had
dismissed
his
chauffeur
and
given
up
his
idea
of
turning
the
stable
loft
into
a
he
had
even
thought
of
trying
to
let
the
and
the
cottage
on
the
yorkshire
moors
which
he
had
bought
unforeseeingly
in
the
spring
of
last
year
but
michael
and
nicholas
had
persuaded
him
that
this
extreme
measure
was
unnecessary
and
frances
even
with
the
strike
hanging
over
her
was
happy
for
the
children
at
their
first
sight
of
possible
adversity
were
showing
what
was
in
them
their
behaviour
made
her
more
arrogant
than
ever
michael
and
dorothea
had
given
up
their
allowances
and
declared
their
complete
ability
to
support
themselves
they
earned
about
fifty
pounds
a
year
each
on
an
average
she
had
expected
this
from
dorothy
but
not
from
michael
nicholas
was
doing
the
chauffeur
work
in
his
absence
and
john
showed
eagerness
to
offer
up
his
last
year
at
oxford
he
pressed
it
on
his
father
as
his
contribution
to
the
family
economies
veronica
brought
her
minute
dividends
paid
to
her
every
quarter
through
ferdinand
cameron
solicitors
and
laid
them
at
frances
and
anthony
feet
as
if
anthony
said
i
could
have
taken
her
poor
little
money
veronica
thought
she
could
go
out
as
a
music
teacher
there
were
moments
when
frances
positively
enjoyed
the
strike
her
mind
refused
to
grasp
the
danger
of
the
situation
she
suspected
anthony
of
exaggerating
his
losses
in
order
to
draw
out
dorothy
and
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
and
wallow
in
their
moral
beauty
he
too
was
arrogant
he
was
convinced
that
though
there
might
be
girls
like
dorothea
there
were
no
boys
like
his
three
sons
as
for
the
strike
in
the
building
trade
strikes
as
anthony
insisted
had
happened
before
and
none
of
them
had
threatened
for
very
long
either
frances
peace
of
mind
or
anthony
prosperity
the
present
strike
was
not
interfering
in
the
least
with
anthony
harrison
day
the
last
of
the
season
it
fell
this
year
on
the
of
july
long
afterwards
she
remembered
it
by
what
happened
at
the
end
of
it
frances
day
the
fourth
saturday
in
the
month
was
one
of
those
slight
changes
that
are
profoundly
significant
it
stood
for
regeneration
and
a
change
of
heart
it
marked
the
close
of
an
epoch
frances
life
of
exclusive
motherhood
had
ended
she
had
become
or
was
at
any
rate
trying
to
become
a
social
creature
her
day
had
bored
her
terribly
at
first
when
it
did
frighten
her
she
was
only
just
beginning
to
get
used
to
it
and
still
at
times
she
had
the
air
of
not
taking
it
seriously
it
had
been
forced
on
her
dorothea
had
decided
that
she
must
have
a
day
like
other
people
she
had
had
it
since
michael
first
volume
of
poems
had
come
out
in
the
spring
of
the
year
before
when
the
young
men
who
met
every
friday
evening
in
lawrence
stephen
study
began
to
meet
at
father
house
anthony
liked
to
think
that
his
house
was
the
centre
of
all
this
palpitating
radiant
life
of
young
men
doing
all
sorts
of
wonderful
energetic
important
interesting
things
they
stirred
the
air
about
him
and
kept
it
clean
he
liked
the
sound
of
their
feet
and
of
their
voices
and
of
their
laughter
and
when
the
house
was
quiet
and
anthony
had
frances
to
himself
he
liked
that
too
but
frances
thought
if
only
they
would
come
quite
so
often
if
only
i
could
have
my
children
sometimes
to
myself
it
was
the
last
rebellion
of
her
flesh
that
had
borne
and
suckled
them
there
was
this
to
be
said
for
frances
day
that
it
attracted
and
diverted
and
confined
to
one
time
and
one
place
a
whole
crowd
of
tiresome
people
who
without
it
would
have
spread
themselves
over
the
whole
month
also
that
it
gave
a
great
deal
of
innocent
happiness
to
the
poor
dears
frances
meant
old
fleming
and
louie
and
emmeline
and
edith
fleming
who
figured
as
essential
parts
of
the
social
event
she
meant
and
jervis
who
in
the
inconceivability
of
their
absence
on
frances
bay
wondered
more
than
ever
why
their
daughter
rosalind
found
them
so
impossible
she
meant
vereker
and
norris
from
the
office
and
their
wives
and
children
and
anthony
secretary
miss
lathom
if
miss
lathom
were
not
engaged
to
young
george
vereker
she
soon
would
be
to
judge
by
the
behaviour
of
their
indiscreet
and
guileless
faces
frances
also
meant
her
bartholomew
home
from
india
for
good
and
cherishing
a
new
disease
more
secret
and
more
dangerous
than
his
cancer
she
meant
her
brother
maurice
who
was
genuinely
invalided
who
had
come
back
from
california
for
the
last
time
and
would
never
be
sent
out
anywhere
again
dorothea
had
said
let
kill
them
all
off
in
one
awful
day
frances
had
said
yes
but
we
must
do
it
decently
we
must
be
kind
to
them
poor
dears
above
all
they
must
be
decent
to
grannie
and
the
aunties
and
to
uncle
morrie
and
uncle
bartie
that
was
the
only
burden
she
had
laid
on
her
children
it
was
a
case
of
noblesse
oblige
their
youth
constrained
them
they
had
received
so
much
and
they
had
been
let
off
so
much
not
one
of
them
had
inherited
the
taint
that
made
maurice
and
emmeline
fleming
and
bartie
harrison
creatures
diseased
and
irresponsible
they
could
afford
to
be
pitiful
and
merciful
and
now
that
the
children
were
grown
up
frances
could
afford
to
be
pitiful
and
merciful
herself
she
could
even
afford
to
be
grateful
to
the
poor
dears
she
looked
on
maurice
and
emmeline
and
bartie
as
scapegoats
bearers
of
the
hereditary
taint
whose
affliction
left
her
children
clean
she
thought
of
them
more
and
more
in
this
sacred
and
sacrificial
character
at
frances
could
be
gentle
over
the
things
that
had
worried
and
irritated
her
at
like
anthony
she
was
still
young
and
strong
through
the
youth
and
strength
of
her
children
and
the
poor
dears
were
getting
weak
and
old
grannie
was
and
maurice
the
youngest
of
that
generation
was
and
he
looked
sixty
every
year
frances
was
more
acutely
aware
of
their
pathos
their
futility
their
mortality
they
would
be
broken
and
gone
so
soon
and
so
utterly
leaving
no
name
no
sign
or
memorial
of
themselves
only
living
in
the
memories
of
her
children
who
would
remain
and
with
an
awful
sense
of
mortality
surrounding
them
her
children
had
learned
that
they
must
be
kind
because
the
old
people
would
be
gone
while
they
endured
and
remained
this
saturday
being
the
last
of
the
season
they
had
all
come
not
only
the
flemings
but
the
jervises
and
verekers
and
norrises
and
uncle
bartie
the
fine
weather
alone
would
have
brought
them
bartie
more
morose
and
irritable
than
ever
sat
under
the
tree
of
heaven
and
watched
the
triumphal
progress
of
the
day
he
scowled
darkly
and
sourly
at
each
group
in
turn
at
the
young
men
in
white
flannels
playing
tennis
at
and
jervis
and
the
verekers
and
norrises
at
the
flemings
old
fleming
and
louie
and
emmeline
and
edith
and
the
disgraceful
maurice
all
five
of
them
useless
pensioners
on
his
brother
bounty
maurice
a
thing
of
battered
sodden
flesh
hanging
loose
on
brittle
bone
a
rickety
prop
for
the
irreproachable
summer
suit
bought
with
anthony
money
he
scowled
at
the
tables
covered
with
fine
white
linen
and
at
the
costly
silver
and
old
china
at
the
sandwiches
and
cakes
and
ices
and
the
fruits
and
the
claret
cup
and
champagne
cup
glowing
and
shining
in
the
tall
glass
jugs
and
at
the
pretty
maidservants
going
to
and
fro
in
their
accomplished
service
bartie
wondered
how
on
earth
anthony
managed
it
his
wonder
was
a
savage
joy
to
bartie
jervis
a
heavy
pessimistic
man
wondered
how
they
managed
it
and
jervis
wonder
had
its
own
voluptuous
quality
vereker
and
norris
who
held
that
a
strike
was
a
downright
serious
matter
also
wondered
but
they
were
sustained
by
their
immense
belief
in
anthony
anthony
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
always
had
known
a
strike
might
be
serious
while
it
lasted
but
it
did
last
and
nicholas
was
in
the
business
now
and
john
was
coming
into
it
next
year
and
nicholas
might
be
married
again
by
that
time
and
the
chances
were
that
the
firm
of
harrison
and
harrison
would
last
long
enough
to
provide
for
a
young
vereker
and
a
still
younger
norris
in
spite
of
the
strike
and
vereker
and
and
norris
like
frances
and
anthony
were
extraordinarily
cheerful
that
afternoon
so
were
young
george
vereker
and
miss
lathom
i
ca
think
why
i
feel
so
happy
said
vereker
to
norris
she
was
looking
at
her
son
george
nor
i
either
said
miss
lathom
who
was
trying
suddenly
to
look
at
nothing
in
particular
miss
lathom
lied
and
vereker
lied
they
knew
perfectly
well
why
they
were
happy
each
knew
that
the
other
lied
each
knew
that
the
other
knew
she
knew
and
neither
of
them
could
have
said
why
she
found
it
so
necessary
to
lie
and
to
frances
this
happiness
of
vereker
and
of
young
vereker
and
miss
lathom
was
significant
and
delightful
as
if
she
had
been
personally
responsible
for
it
a
day
flashed
out
of
her
memory
on
a
trail
of
blue
larkspurs
and
of
something
that
she
had
forgotten
something
that
was
mixed
up
with
and
jervis
and
rosalind
she
stared
at
the
larkspurs
as
if
they
held
the
clue
nicky
face
appeared
among
the
tall
blue
spires
darling
face
tied
up
in
a
scarf
brown
stripes
and
yellow
stripes
something
to
do
with
a
white
cake
it
must
have
been
birthday
now
she
had
it
jervis
cricket
scarf
it
was
the
day
of
nicky
worst
earache
the
day
when
vereker
climbed
the
tree
of
heaven
was
it
possible
that
vereker
had
ever
climbed
that
tree
the
day
when
michael
would
go
to
the
party
birthday
eight
candles
burning
for
rosalind
why
it
was
nineteen
years
ago
was
a
baby
then
and
michael
and
nicky
were
only
little
boys
and
look
at
them
now
she
fed
her
arrogance
by
gazing
on
the
tall
firmly
knit
slender
bodies
of
her
sons
in
white
flannels
playing
furiously
and
well
dorothy
is
looking
very
handsome
jervis
said
yes
certainly
dorothy
was
looking
handsome
but
frances
loved
before
all
things
the
male
beauty
of
her
sons
in
michael
and
nicholas
it
had
reached
perfection
the
clean
hard
perfection
that
would
last
as
had
lasted
she
thought
of
their
beauty
that
had
passed
from
her
dying
many
deaths
each
death
hurting
her
the
tender
mortal
beauty
of
babyhood
of
childhood
of
boyhood
but
this
invulnerable
beauty
of
their
young
manhood
would
be
with
her
for
a
long
time
john
would
have
it
john
was
only
a
fairer
nicholas
but
as
yet
his
beauty
had
not
hardened
his
boyhood
lingered
in
the
fine
tissues
of
his
mouth
and
in
his
eyelids
and
the
soft
corners
of
his
eyes
so
that
in
john
she
could
still
see
what
nicky
had
been
she
had
adored
anthony
body
as
if
she
had
foreseen
that
it
would
give
her
such
sons
as
these
and
in
her
children
she
had
adored
the
small
bodies
through
whose
clean
firm
beauty
she
foresaw
the
beauty
of
their
manhood
these
were
the
same
bodies
the
same
faces
that
she
had
loved
in
them
as
children
nothing
was
blurred
or
twisted
or
overlaid
michael
at
was
beautiful
and
serious
as
she
had
foreseen
him
frances
knew
that
michael
had
genius
and
at
other
moments
she
was
proud
of
his
genius
but
at
this
particular
moment
sitting
beside
her
friend
and
conscious
of
her
jealousy
she
was
chiefly
aware
of
his
body
michael
body
was
quiescent
its
beauty
gave
her
a
proud
but
austere
and
tranquil
satisfaction
it
was
when
she
looked
at
her
second
son
that
something
caught
at
her
breath
and
held
it
she
saw
him
as
the
lover
and
bridegroom
of
veronica
her
sense
of
his
virility
was
terrible
to
her
and
delightful
perhaps
they
were
engaged
already
and
frances
was
sorry
for
jervis
who
had
borne
no
sons
who
had
only
borne
one
unattractive
and
unsatisfactory
daughter
she
used
to
be
sorry
for
her
because
rosalind
was
pink
and
fat
and
fluffy
she
was
sorry
for
her
now
because
rosalind
was
unsatisfactory
she
was
sorry
for
norris
because
her
boy
could
never
grow
up
like
michael
or
nicholas
or
john
she
was
sorry
for
vereker
because
george
though
he
looked
all
right
when
he
was
by
himself
became
clumsy
and
common
at
once
beside
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
george
was
also
in
white
flannels
he
played
furiously
and
well
he
played
too
furiously
and
too
consciously
well
he
was
too
damp
and
too
excited
his
hair
became
damp
and
excited
as
he
played
his
cries
had
a
cockney
tang
her
arrogance
nourished
itself
on
these
contrasts
jervis
looked
wistfully
at
the
young
men
as
they
played
she
looked
still
more
wistfully
at
dorothy
what
do
you
do
she
said
to
keep
your
children
with
you
i
do
nothing
frances
said
i
do
try
to
keep
them
i
never
appealed
to
their
feelings
for
my
own
purposes
or
taken
advantage
of
their
affection
that
all
they
know
that
if
they
want
to
walk
out
of
the
house
and
stay
out
they
can
nobody
stop
them
there
was
a
challenging
reminiscent
glint
in
jervis
eyes
and
his
wife
was
significantly
silent
frances
knew
what
they
were
thinking
nicky
she
said
walked
out
but
he
came
back
again
as
soon
as
he
was
in
trouble
michael
walks
out
and
goes
abroad
every
year
but
he
comes
back
again
dorothy
walks
out
but
she
never
dreamed
of
not
coming
back
again
of
course
if
you
are
afraid
of
taking
risks
said
jervis
i
am
afraid
but
i
never
shown
it
it
very
strange
that
dorothy
has
married
jervis
spoke
she
derived
comfort
from
the
thought
that
dorothy
was
and
not
married
dorothy
said
frances
could
marry
if
she
wanted
to
but
she
does
want
she
was
sorry
for
her
friend
but
she
really
could
not
allow
her
that
consolation
veronica
is
growing
up
very
said
jervis
then
but
it
was
no
use
frances
was
aware
that
veronica
was
grown
up
and
that
she
was
and
that
nicky
loved
her
but
shafts
fell
wide
of
all
her
vulnerable
places
frances
was
no
longer
afraid
veronica
she
said
is
growing
up
very
good
it
was
not
the
word
she
would
have
chosen
yet
it
was
the
only
one
she
could
think
of
as
likely
to
convey
to
jervis
what
she
wanted
her
to
know
though
it
left
her
obtuseness
without
any
sense
of
veronica
mysterious
quality
she
herself
had
never
tried
to
think
of
a
word
for
it
before
she
was
only
driven
to
it
now
because
she
detected
in
her
friend
tone
a
challenge
and
a
warning
it
was
as
if
rosalind
mother
had
said
extensively
and
with
pointed
reference
to
the
facts
veronica
is
dangerous
her
mother
has
had
adventures
she
is
and
she
is
and
nicky
is
susceptible
to
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
do
look
out
he
will
be
caught
again
the
only
difference
between
phyllis
desmond
and
veronica
is
in
their
skins
so
when
frances
said
veronica
was
good
she
meant
that
jervis
should
understand
once
for
all
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
like
her
mother
or
like
phyllis
desmond
that
was
enough
for
jervis
but
it
was
not
enough
for
frances
who
found
her
mind
wandering
off
from
rosalind
mother
and
looking
for
the
word
of
words
that
would
express
her
own
meaning
to
her
own
satisfaction
her
thoughts
went
on
deep
down
under
the
stream
of
conversation
that
flowed
through
her
from
jervis
on
her
right
hand
to
vereker
and
norris
on
her
left
veronica
was
good
but
she
was
not
wrapped
up
in
other
people
lives
as
frances
was
wrapped
up
she
was
wrapped
up
not
in
herself
but
in
some
life
of
her
own
that
as
frances
made
it
out
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
anybody
else
and
yet
veronica
knew
what
you
were
feeling
and
what
you
were
thinking
and
what
you
were
going
to
do
and
what
was
happening
to
you
she
had
really
known
in
dresden
what
was
happening
to
nicky
when
desmond
made
him
marry
her
it
was
as
if
in
her
the
walls
that
divide
every
soul
from
every
other
soul
were
made
of
some
thin
and
porous
stuff
that
let
things
through
and
in
this
life
of
yours
for
the
moments
that
she
shared
it
she
lived
intensely
with
uncanny
delight
and
pain
that
were
her
own
and
not
her
own
and
frances
wanted
some
hard
tight
theory
that
would
reconcile
these
extremes
of
penetration
and
detachment
she
remembered
that
ferdinand
cameron
had
been
like
that
he
saw
things
he
was
a
creature
of
queer
sudden
sympathies
and
insights
she
supposed
it
was
the
highland
blood
in
both
of
them
vereker
on
her
right
expressed
the
hope
that
bartholomew
was
better
frances
said
he
never
would
be
better
till
chemists
were
forbidden
to
advertise
and
the
medical
and
were
suppressed
bartie
would
read
them
and
they
supplied
him
with
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
diseases
she
thought
seeing
things
had
not
made
poor
ferdie
happy
and
veronica
in
her
innermost
life
was
happy
she
had
been
happy
when
she
came
back
from
germany
before
she
could
have
known
that
nicky
cared
for
her
before
nicky
knew
it
himself
supposing
she
had
known
it
all
the
time
but
that
frances
said
to
herself
was
nonsense
if
she
had
known
as
much
as
all
that
why
should
she
have
suffered
so
horribly
that
she
had
nearly
died
of
it
unless
supposing
it
had
been
his
suffering
that
she
had
nearly
died
of
norris
on
her
left
was
saying
that
she
was
sorry
to
see
maurice
looking
so
sadly
and
frances
heard
herself
replying
that
morrie
been
fit
for
anything
since
he
was
in
south
africa
between
two
batteries
of
conversation
the
serious
theme
sustained
itself
she
thought
then
nicky
had
suffered
and
veronica
was
the
only
one
who
knew
she
knew
more
about
nicky
than
mother
this
thought
was
disagreeable
to
frances
it
was
all
nonsense
she
did
really
believe
that
these
things
happened
yet
why
not
michael
said
they
happened
even
dorothy
who
did
believe
in
god
and
immortality
or
anything
believed
that
she
gave
it
up
it
was
beyond
her
it
bothered
her
yes
her
last
birthday
norris
had
said
that
fleming
was
wonderful
frances
thought
it
wonderful
what
veronica
does
to
them
the
sets
had
changed
nicholas
and
a
girl
friend
of
veronica
played
against
george
vereker
and
miss
lathom
john
with
jervis
for
his
handicap
played
against
anthony
and
norris
the
very
young
norris
fielded
all
afternoon
he
had
hoped
to
distinguish
himself
by
catching
some
ball
in
full
flight
as
it
went
out
it
was
a
pure
and
high
ambition
for
he
knew
he
was
so
young
and
unimportant
that
only
the
eyes
of
god
and
of
his
mother
watched
him
michael
had
dropped
out
of
it
he
sat
beside
dorothy
under
the
tree
of
heaven
and
watched
veronica
veronica
wonderful
he
said
did
you
see
that
dorothy
had
seen
veronica
had
kept
aunt
emmeline
quiet
all
afternoon
she
bad
made
bartie
eat
an
ice
under
the
impression
that
it
would
be
good
for
him
and
now
she
had
gone
with
morrie
to
the
table
where
the
drinks
were
and
had
taken
his
third
glass
of
champagne
cup
from
him
and
made
him
drink
lemonade
instead
how
does
she
do
it
said
michael
i
do
know
she
does
know
herself
i
used
to
think
i
could
manage
people
but
i
not
in
it
with
ronny
she
ought
to
be
a
wardress
in
a
lunatic
asylum
now
look
at
that
veronica
had
returned
to
the
group
formed
by
grannie
and
the
aunties
and
some
strangers
the
eyes
of
the
four
fleming
women
had
looked
after
her
as
she
went
from
them
they
looked
towards
her
now
as
if
some
great
need
some
great
longing
were
appeased
by
her
return
grannie
made
a
place
by
her
side
for
the
young
girl
she
took
her
arm
the
young
white
arm
bare
from
the
elbow
in
its
short
sleeve
and
made
it
lie
across
her
knees
from
time
to
time
grannie
yellow
withered
hand
stroked
the
smooth
warm
white
arm
or
held
it
emmeline
and
edith
squatted
on
the
grass
at
veronica
feet
their
worn
faces
and
the
worn
face
of
louie
looked
at
her
they
hung
on
her
fascinated
curiously
tranquillized
as
if
they
drank
from
her
youth
it
funny
dorothy
said
when
you
think
how
they
used
to
hate
her
it
horrible
said
michael
he
got
up
and
took
veronica
away
he
was
lying
at
her
feet
now
on
the
grass
in
the
far
corner
of
the
lawn
under
the
terrace
why
do
you
go
to
them
he
said
because
they
want
me
you
must
go
when
they
want
you
you
must
let
them
get
hold
of
you
they
do
get
hold
of
me
nothing
gets
hold
of
me
i
want
to
help
them
they
say
it
does
them
good
to
have
me
with
them
i
should
think
it
did
do
them
good
they
feed
on
you
ronny
i
can
see
it
by
the
way
they
look
at
you
you
die
of
them
if
you
do
give
it
up
give
what
up
your
game
of
keeping
them
going
that
is
your
game
is
it
everybody
saying
how
wonderful
grannie
is
they
mean
she
ought
to
have
been
dead
years
ago
they
were
all
old
horribly
old
and
done
for
ages
ago
i
can
remember
them
but
they
know
that
if
they
can
get
a
young
virgin
sacrificed
to
them
they
go
on
you
the
young
virgin
you
making
them
go
on
if
i
could
it
would
hurt
me
nothing
hurts
you
michael
when
you
happy
it
awful
to
think
how
they
lived
without
being
happy
without
loving
they
used
to
hate
me
because
i
vera
daughter
they
do
hate
me
now
you
do
hate
what
you
feed
on
you
love
it
they
vampires
suck
your
life
out
of
you
i
wonder
you
not
afraid
of
them
i
afraid
of
them
i
always
was
afraid
of
them
when
i
was
a
kid
and
mother
used
to
send
me
with
messages
to
that
beastly
spooky
house
they
live
in
i
used
to
think
it
was
poor
old
grandpapa
ghost
i
funked
but
i
know
now
it
was
it
was
those
four
terrible
women
they
ghosts
i
thought
you
were
afraid
of
ghosts
i
much
more
afraid
of
you
when
you
cruel
ca
you
see
how
awful
it
must
be
for
them
to
be
ghosts
ghosts
among
living
people
everybody
afraid
of
them
not
wanting
them
michael
it
would
be
better
to
be
dead
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
frances
day
changed
its
appearance
and
its
character
in
the
tennis
courts
michael
friends
played
singles
with
an
incomparable
fury
frankly
rejecting
the
partners
offered
them
and
disdaining
inferior
antagonists
they
played
ellis
against
mitchell
and
against
nicholas
they
had
arrived
late
with
vera
and
lawrence
stephen
it
had
come
to
that
anthony
and
frances
found
that
they
could
not
go
on
for
ever
refusing
the
acquaintance
of
the
man
who
had
done
so
much
for
michael
stephen
enthusiastic
eulogy
of
michael
poems
had
made
an
end
of
that
old
animosity
a
year
ago
practically
they
had
had
to
choose
between
bartie
and
lawrence
stephen
as
the
turning
point
of
honour
michael
had
made
them
see
that
it
was
possible
to
overvalue
bartie
also
that
it
was
possible
to
pay
too
high
a
price
for
a
consecrated
moral
attitude
in
all
his
life
the
wretched
bartie
had
never
done
a
thing
for
any
of
them
whereas
he
michael
owed
his
rather
extraordinary
success
absolutely
to
lawrence
stephen
if
the
strike
made
his
father
bankrupt
he
would
owe
his
very
means
of
livelihood
to
lawrence
stephen
besides
he
liked
stephen
and
it
complicated
things
most
frightfully
to
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
with
people
who
disliked
him
if
michael
said
they
chose
to
dissociate
themselves
altogether
from
their
eldest
son
and
his
career
very
well
they
could
go
on
ignoring
and
tacitly
insulting
stephen
he
could
understand
their
taking
a
consistently
line
like
that
but
so
long
as
they
had
any
regard
either
for
him
or
his
career
he
did
see
how
they
could
very
well
keep
it
up
any
longer
he
was
sorry
of
course
that
his
career
had
let
them
in
for
stephen
if
they
did
like
him
but
there
it
was
and
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
there
you
might
vindicate
bartie
gloriously
michael
said
by
turning
me
out
of
the
house
and
disinheriting
me
but
would
it
be
worth
while
not
asking
you
to
condone
stephen
conduct
if
you
ca
condone
it
i
asking
you
either
to
acknowledge
repudiate
your
son
debts
after
all
if
can
condone
your
beastly
treatment
of
him
i
would
like
him
if
he
was
the
swine
you
think
him
and
anthony
had
appealed
to
michael
mother
to
his
well
frances
what
do
you
think
ought
we
or
ought
we
she
had
replied
i
think
we
ought
to
stand
solid
behind
michael
it
was
michael
life
that
counted
for
it
was
going
on
into
a
great
future
bartie
would
pass
and
michael
would
remain
their
nervous
advances
had
ended
in
a
complete
surrender
to
charm
vera
and
stephen
seemed
to
think
that
the
way
to
show
the
sincerity
and
sweetness
of
their
reconciliation
was
to
turn
up
as
often
as
possible
on
frances
day
they
arrived
always
at
the
same
hour
a
little
late
they
came
by
the
road
and
the
front
door
so
that
when
bartie
saw
them
coming
he
could
retreat
through
the
garden
door
and
the
lane
the
flemings
and
the
jervises
retreated
with
him
and
presently
when
it
had
had
a
good
look
at
the
celebrities
the
rest
of
the
party
followed
this
saturday
frances
day
dwindled
and
melted
away
and
closed
after
its
manner
only
vera
and
stephen
lingered
they
stayed
on
talking
to
michael
long
after
everybody
else
had
gone
stephen
said
he
had
come
to
say
to
michael
people
and
to
make
a
proposal
to
michael
himself
he
was
going
to
ireland
vera
interrupted
him
with
passion
he
is
he
has
any
proposal
to
make
he
has
come
to
say
her
restless
unhappy
eyes
turned
to
him
incessantly
as
if
more
than
ever
she
was
afraid
that
he
would
escape
her
that
he
would
go
off
god
knew
where
god
knew
where
he
was
going
but
vera
did
not
believe
that
he
was
going
to
ireland
he
had
talked
about
going
to
ireland
for
years
and
he
had
never
gone
stephen
looked
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
as
if
he
did
not
even
see
michael
very
distinctly
i
going
he
said
to
ireland
on
monday
week
the
third
of
august
i
may
come
back
for
long
enough
i
may
not
come
back
at
all
that
the
sort
of
thing
he
keeps
on
saying
i
may
not
come
back
so
i
want
you
to
take
over
the
for
me
ellis
and
my
secretary
will
show
you
how
it
stands
you
know
what
to
do
i
can
trust
you
not
to
let
it
down
he
does
mean
what
he
says
michael
he
only
saying
it
to
frighten
me
he
been
holding
it
over
me
for
years
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
wo
touch
his
old
could
i
go
to
ireland
for
you
you
could
why
not
what
do
you
think
you
going
to
do
there
i
going
to
pull
the
nationalists
together
so
that
if
there
civil
war
in
ireland
the
irish
will
have
a
chance
to
win
thank
god
for
carson
he
given
us
the
opportunity
we
wanted
tell
him
he
not
to
go
michael
he
wo
listen
to
me
but
he
mind
what
you
say
i
want
to
go
instead
of
him
you
ca
go
instead
of
me
nobody
can
go
instead
of
me
i
can
go
with
you
you
ca
larry
if
you
take
michael
to
ireland
anthony
and
frances
will
never
forgive
you
never
forgive
you
i
not
taking
michael
to
ireland
i
telling
you
there
no
reason
why
michael
should
go
to
ireland
at
all
it
is
country
you
need
rub
in
said
michael
it
is
said
vera
ireland
does
want
you
the
nationalists
do
want
you
you
said
yourself
they
turned
you
out
of
ireland
when
you
lived
in
england
all
these
years
why
should
you
go
back
to
a
place
that
does
want
you
because
if
carson
gets
a
free
hand
i
see
some
chance
of
ireland
being
a
free
country
vera
wailed
and
entreated
she
said
it
showed
how
much
he
cared
for
her
it
showed
that
he
was
tired
of
her
why
could
he
say
so
and
have
done
with
it
it
not
she
said
as
if
you
could
really
do
anything
you
a
dreamer
ireland
has
had
enough
of
dreamers
and
stephen
eyes
looked
over
her
head
into
the
high
branches
of
the
tree
of
heaven
as
if
he
saw
his
dream
shining
clear
through
them
like
a
moon
the
opportunist
could
see
nothing
but
his
sublime
opportunity
michael
went
back
with
him
to
dine
and
talk
it
over
there
was
to
be
civil
war
in
ireland
then
he
thought
if
only
lawrence
would
let
him
go
with
him
he
wanted
to
go
to
ireland
to
join
the
nationalists
and
fight
for
ireland
fight
for
the
freedom
he
was
always
dreaming
about
would
be
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
a
finer
thing
than
writing
poems
about
ireland
lawrence
stephen
went
soberly
and
steadily
through
the
affair
of
the
explaining
things
to
michael
he
wanted
this
done
and
this
and
over
and
over
again
michael
voice
broke
through
his
instructions
why
could
he
go
to
ireland
instead
of
lawrence
or
if
lawrence
would
let
him
go
instead
of
him
he
might
at
least
take
him
with
him
he
did
want
to
stay
at
home
editing
the
ellis
or
mitchell
or
would
edit
it
better
than
he
could
even
the
wretched
wadham
would
edit
it
just
as
well
he
wanted
to
go
to
ireland
and
fight
but
lawrence
would
let
him
go
he
was
going
to
have
the
blood
on
his
hands
his
genius
and
his
youth
were
too
precious
besides
ireland
was
not
his
country
it
was
past
ten
frances
was
alone
in
the
she
sat
by
the
open
window
and
waited
and
watched
the
quiet
garden
lay
open
to
her
sight
only
the
inner
end
of
the
farther
terrace
under
the
orchard
wall
was
hidden
by
a
high
screen
of
privet
it
seemed
hours
to
frances
since
she
had
seen
nicky
and
veronica
go
down
the
lawn
on
to
the
terrace
and
then
anthony
had
gone
out
too
she
was
vexed
with
anthony
she
could
see
him
sitting
under
his
her
tree
of
heaven
his
white
gave
out
an
oblong
gleam
like
phosphorous
in
the
darkness
under
the
tree
she
was
watching
to
see
that
he
did
get
up
and
go
on
to
the
terrace
anthony
had
no
business
in
the
garden
at
all
he
was
catching
cold
in
it
he
had
sneezed
twice
she
wanted
nicholas
and
veronica
to
have
the
garden
to
themselves
and
the
perfect
stillness
of
the
twilight
to
themselves
every
tree
and
every
little
leaf
and
flower
keeping
quiet
for
them
and
there
was
anthony
sneezing
she
was
restless
and
impatient
as
if
she
carried
the
burden
of
their
passion
in
her
own
heart
presently
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
got
up
and
called
to
anthony
to
come
in
he
came
obediently
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
said
planting
yourself
out
there
and
sneezing
i
could
see
your
a
mile
off
it
indecent
of
you
why
indecent
because
nicky
and
veronica
are
out
there
i
do
see
them
do
you
suppose
they
want
you
to
see
them
she
turned
the
electric
light
on
full
to
make
darkness
of
their
twilight
out
there
nicky
and
veronica
talked
together
in
the
twilight
sitting
on
the
seat
under
the
orchard
well
behind
the
privet
screen
they
did
not
see
anthony
sitting
under
the
they
did
not
hear
him
they
did
not
hear
frances
calling
to
him
to
come
in
they
were
utterly
unaware
of
frances
and
anthony
ronny
he
said
did
michael
say
anything
to
you
when
this
afternoon
when
he
made
you
come
with
him
here
how
do
you
mean
anything
you
know
what
i
mean
yes
did
he
ask
you
to
marry
him
no
he
said
a
lot
of
funny
things
but
he
did
say
that
he
would
why
would
he
because
he
just
would
well
he
says
he
understands
you
then
said
veronica
conclusively
of
course
he
would
yes
but
he
says
do
dear
nicky
you
understand
me
when
nobody
else
does
you
always
did
yes
when
we
were
kids
but
supposing
i
ever
did
would
it
matter
you
see
i
stupid
and
caring
caring
awfully
might
make
me
stupider
people
got
to
understand
each
other
to
that
she
replied
astonishingly
are
you
quite
sure
you
understand
about
ferdie
ferdie
yes
she
turned
her
face
full
to
him
i
do
know
whether
you
know
about
it
did
till
mother
told
me
the
other
day
ferdie
daughter
did
you
know
oh
lord
yes
i
known
it
for
oh
simply
ever
so
long
who
told
you
dorothy
i
think
but
i
guessed
it
because
of
something
he
said
once
about
seeing
ghosts
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
i
feel
about
it
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
not
a
bit
ashamed
of
it
i
proud
i
i
daughter
not
bartie
i
take
his
name
so
that
everybody
should
know
i
was
his
daughter
only
that
i
like
uncle
anthony
name
best
glad
mother
loved
him
so
am
i
ronny
i
know
i
should
have
liked
bartie
daughter
bartie
daughter
would
have
been
you
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
face
against
his
face
and
it
was
as
if
desmond
had
never
been
a
little
while
ago
he
had
hated
desmond
because
she
had
come
before
veronica
she
had
taken
what
belonged
to
veronica
the
first
tremor
of
his
passion
the
irrecoverable
delight
and
surprise
and
now
he
knew
that
because
he
had
not
loved
her
she
had
taken
nothing
do
you
love
me
do
you
love
you
know
i
love
you
you
know
you
know
what
they
said
was
new
and
wonderful
to
them
as
if
nobody
before
them
had
ever
thought
of
it
yet
that
night
all
over
the
heath
in
hollows
under
the
and
on
beds
of
trampled
grass
young
lovers
lay
in
each
other
arms
and
said
the
same
thing
in
the
same
words
do
you
love
me
you
know
i
love
you
over
and
over
in
voices
drowsy
and
thick
with
love
there
one
thing
i
have
thought
of
said
nicky
and
that
that
damned
strike
if
it
hits
daddy
badly
we
may
have
to
wait
goodness
knows
how
long
ages
we
may
have
to
i
wait
all
my
life
if
i
could
have
you
in
the
last
five
seconds
of
it
and
if
i
could
i
still
wait
and
presently
veronica
remembered
michael
why
did
you
ask
me
whether
mick
had
said
anything
because
i
thought
you
ought
to
know
about
it
before
you
besides
if
he
we
should
have
had
to
wait
a
bit
before
we
told
him
it
seemed
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
them
marrying
if
they
liked
the
strike
anthony
said
could
hit
him
as
badly
as
all
that
he
and
frances
sat
up
till
long
past
midnight
talking
about
their
plans
and
the
children
plans
it
was
all
settled
the
first
week
in
august
they
would
go
down
to
morfe
for
the
shooting
they
would
stay
there
till
the
first
week
in
september
nicky
and
veronica
would
be
married
the
first
week
in
october
and
they
would
go
to
france
and
belgium
and
germany
for
their
honeymoon
xix
they
did
not
go
down
to
morfe
the
first
week
in
august
for
the
shooting
neither
did
lawrence
stephen
go
to
ireland
on
monday
the
third
at
the
moment
when
he
should
have
been
receiving
the
congratulations
of
the
dublin
nationalists
after
his
impassioned
appeal
for
militant
consolidation
redmond
and
sir
edward
carson
were
shaking
hands
dramatically
in
the
house
of
commons
stephen
sublime
opportunity
the
civil
war
had
been
snatched
from
him
by
the
unforeseen
and
there
was
no
chance
of
nicky
and
veronica
going
to
belgium
and
france
and
germany
for
their
honeymoon
for
within
nine
days
of
frances
day
germany
had
declared
war
on
france
and
russia
and
was
marching
over
the
belgian
frontier
on
her
way
to
paris
frances
aroused
at
last
to
realization
of
the
affairs
of
nations
asked
like
several
million
women
what
does
it
mean
and
anthony
like
several
million
men
answered
it
means
armageddon
like
several
million
people
they
both
thought
he
was
saying
something
as
original
as
it
was
impressive
something
clear
and
final
and
descriptive
armageddon
stolid
unimaginative
people
went
about
saying
it
to
each
other
the
sound
of
the
word
thrilled
them
intoxicated
them
gave
them
an
awful
feeling
that
was
at
the
same
time
in
some
odd
way
agreeable
it
stirred
them
with
a
solemn
and
sombre
passion
they
said
armageddon
it
means
armageddon
yet
nobody
knew
and
nobody
asked
or
thought
of
asking
what
armageddon
meant
shall
we
come
into
it
said
frances
she
was
thinking
of
the
royal
navy
turning
out
to
the
last
destroyer
to
save
england
from
invasion
of
the
british
army
most
superfluously
prepared
to
defend
england
from
the
invader
who
after
all
could
not
invade
of
indian
troops
pouring
into
england
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
she
had
the
healthy
british
mind
that
refuses
and
always
has
refused
to
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
disaster
yet
she
asked
continually
would
england
be
drawn
in
she
was
thankful
that
none
of
her
sons
had
gone
into
the
army
or
the
navy
whoever
else
was
in
they
would
be
out
of
it
at
first
anthony
said
no
of
course
england
would
be
drawn
in
then
on
the
morning
of
england
ultimatum
the
closing
of
the
stock
exchange
and
the
banks
made
him
thoughtful
and
he
admitted
that
it
looked
as
if
england
might
be
drawn
in
after
all
the
long
day
without
any
business
for
him
and
nicholas
disturbed
him
there
was
a
nasty
hovering
smell
of
ruin
in
the
air
but
there
was
no
panic
the
closing
of
the
banks
was
only
a
wise
precaution
against
panic
and
by
evening
as
the
tremendous
significance
of
the
ultimatum
sank
into
him
he
said
definitively
that
england
would
not
be
drawn
in
then
drayton
whom
they
had
not
seen
for
months
since
he
had
had
his
promotion
telephoned
to
dorothy
to
come
and
dine
with
him
at
his
club
in
dover
street
anthony
missed
altogether
the
significance
of
he
had
actually
made
for
himself
an
peace
in
which
coffee
could
be
drunk
and
cigarettes
smoked
as
if
nothing
were
happening
to
europe
england
he
said
will
not
be
drawn
in
because
her
ultimatum
will
stop
the
war
there
wo
be
any
armageddon
oh
wo
there
said
michael
and
i
can
tell
you
there
wo
be
much
left
of
us
after
it
over
he
had
been
in
germany
and
he
knew
he
carried
himself
with
a
sort
of
stern
haughtiness
as
one
who
knew
better
than
any
of
them
and
yet
his
words
conveyed
no
picture
to
his
brain
no
definite
image
of
anything
at
all
but
in
nicholas
brain
images
gathered
fast
one
after
another
they
thickened
clear
vivid
images
with
hard
outlines
they
came
slowly
but
with
order
and
precision
while
the
others
talked
he
had
been
silent
and
very
grave
of
us
be
left
he
said
but
it
take
us
all
our
time
anthony
looked
thoughtfully
at
nicholas
a
sudden
wave
of
realization
beat
up
against
his
consciousness
and
receded
well
he
said
we
shall
know
at
midnight
an
immense
restlessness
came
over
them
at
a
eight
dorothy
telephoned
from
her
club
in
grafton
street
frank
had
had
to
leave
her
suddenly
somebody
had
sent
for
him
and
if
they
wanted
to
see
the
sight
of
their
lives
they
were
to
come
into
town
at
once
james
was
packed
with
people
from
whitehall
to
buckingham
palace
it
was
like
nothing
on
earth
and
they
must
miss
it
she
wait
for
them
in
grafton
street
till
a
quarter
to
nine
but
not
a
minute
later
nicky
got
out
his
big
morss
car
they
packed
themselves
into
it
all
six
of
them
somehow
and
he
drove
them
into
london
they
had
a
sense
of
doing
something
strange
and
memorable
and
historic
dorothy
picked
up
at
her
club
showed
nothing
but
a
pleasurable
excitement
she
gave
no
further
information
about
frank
he
had
had
to
go
off
and
see
somebody
what
did
he
think
he
thought
what
he
had
always
thought
only
he
would
talk
about
it
dorothy
was
not
inclined
to
talk
about
it
either
the
morss
was
caught
in
a
line
blocked
at
the
bottom
of
albemarle
street
by
two
streams
of
cars
mixed
with
two
streams
of
foot
passengers
that
poured
steadily
from
piccadilly
into
james
street
michael
and
dorothy
got
out
and
walked
nicholas
gave
up
his
place
to
anthony
and
followed
with
veronica
their
restlessness
had
been
a
part
of
the
immense
restlessness
of
the
crowd
they
were
drawn
as
the
crowd
was
drawn
they
went
as
the
crowd
went
up
and
down
restlessly
from
trafalgar
square
and
whitehall
to
buckingham
palace
from
buckingham
palace
to
whitehall
and
trafalgar
square
they
drifted
down
parliament
street
to
westminster
and
back
again
an
hour
ago
the
drifting
nebulous
crowd
had
split
torn
asunder
between
two
attractions
its
two
masses
had
wheeled
away
one
to
the
east
and
the
other
to
the
west
they
had
gathered
themselves
together
one
at
each
pole
of
the
space
it
now
traversed
the
great
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
balanced
the
multitude
that
had
gravitated
towards
buckingham
palace
to
see
the
king
and
queen
come
out
on
their
balcony
and
show
themselves
to
their
people
and
as
the
edges
of
the
two
masses
gave
way
each
broke
and
scattered
and
was
mixed
again
with
the
other
like
a
flood
confined
and
shaken
it
surged
and
was
driven
back
and
surged
again
from
whitehall
to
buckingham
palace
from
buckingham
palace
to
whitehall
it
looked
for
an
outlet
in
the
narrow
channels
of
the
or
spread
itself
over
the
flats
of
the
green
park
only
to
return
restlessly
upon
itself
sucked
back
by
the
main
current
in
the
mall
it
was
as
if
half
london
had
met
there
for
bank
holiday
part
of
this
crowd
was
drunk
it
was
orgiastic
it
made
strange
fierce
noises
like
the
noises
of
one
enormous
mystically
excited
beast
here
and
there
men
and
women
with
inflamed
and
drunken
faces
reeled
in
each
arms
they
wore
pink
paper
feathers
in
their
hats
some
only
half
intoxicated
flicked
at
each
other
with
long
streamers
of
pink
and
white
paper
carried
like
scourges
on
small
sticks
these
were
the
inspired
but
the
great
body
of
the
crowd
was
sober
it
went
decorously
in
a
long
procession
young
men
with
their
sweethearts
friends
brothers
and
sisters
husbands
and
wives
fathers
and
mothers
with
their
children
none
or
very
few
went
alone
that
night
it
was
an
endless
procession
of
faces
grave
and
thoughtful
faces
uninterested
respectable
faces
faces
of
unmoved
integrity
excited
faces
dreaming
wondering
bewildered
faces
faces
merely
curious
or
curiously
exalted
slightly
ecstatic
fascinated
by
each
other
and
by
the
movements
and
the
lights
laughing
frivolous
faces
and
faces
utterly
vacant
and
unseeing
on
every
other
breast
there
was
a
small
union
jack
pinned
every
other
hand
held
and
waggled
a
union
jack
the
union
jack
flew
from
the
engine
of
every
other
automobile
in
twelve
hours
out
of
nowhere
thousands
and
thousands
of
flags
sprang
magically
into
being
as
if
for
years
london
had
been
preparing
for
this
day
and
in
and
out
of
this
crowd
the
train
of
automobiles
with
their
flags
dashed
up
and
down
the
mall
for
hours
appearing
and
disappearing
intoxicated
youths
with
inflamed
faces
in
full
evening
dress
squatted
on
the
roofs
of
or
rode
astride
on
the
engines
of
their
cars
waving
flags
all
this
movement
drunken
orgiastic
somnambulistic
mysteriously
restless
streamed
up
and
down
between
two
solemn
and
processional
lines
of
lights
two
solemn
and
processional
lines
of
trees
lines
that
stretched
straight
from
whitehall
to
buckingham
palace
in
a
recurrent
pattern
of
trees
and
lamps
dark
trees
twilit
trees
a
lamp
and
a
tree
shining
with
a
metallic
unnatural
green
and
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
gilded
gates
and
a
façade
the
crowd
was
drifting
now
towards
the
palace
michael
and
dorothea
nicholas
and
veronica
went
with
it
in
this
eternal
perambulation
they
met
people
that
they
knew
stephen
and
vera
mitchell
uncle
morrie
and
his
sisters
anthony
looking
rather
solemn
drove
past
them
in
his
car
it
was
like
impossible
grotesque
encounters
in
a
dream
outside
the
palace
the
crowd
moved
up
and
down
without
rest
it
drifted
and
returned
it
circled
round
and
round
the
fountain
in
the
open
spaces
the
intoxicated
and
darted
and
tore
with
the
folly
of
moths
and
the
fury
of
destroyers
they
stung
the
air
with
their
hooting
flags
intoxicated
flags
still
hung
from
their
engines
they
came
flying
drunkenly
out
of
the
dark
like
a
trumpeting
swarm
of
enormous
insects
irresistibly
incessantly
drawn
to
the
lights
of
the
palace
hypnotized
by
the
façade
suddenly
michael
soul
revolted
if
this
demented
herd
of
swine
is
a
great
people
going
into
a
great
war
god
help
us
beasts
it
not
as
if
bloated
skins
were
likely
to
be
punctured
he
called
back
over
his
shoulders
to
the
others
let
get
out
of
this
if
we
do
i
shall
be
sick
he
took
dorothy
by
her
arm
and
shouldered
his
way
out
the
water
had
ceased
playing
in
the
fountain
nicholas
and
veronica
stood
by
the
fountain
the
water
in
the
basin
was
green
like
foul
the
jetsam
of
the
crowd
floated
there
a
small
child
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
basin
and
fished
for
union
jacks
in
the
filthy
pool
its
young
mother
held
it
safe
by
the
tilted
edge
of
its
petticoats
she
looked
up
at
them
and
smiled
they
smiled
back
again
and
turned
away
it
was
quiet
on
the
south
side
by
the
barracks
small
sober
groups
of
twos
and
threes
strolled
there
or
stood
with
their
faces
pressed
close
against
the
railings
peering
into
the
barrack
yard
motionless
earnest
and
attentive
they
stared
at
the
men
in
khaki
moving
about
on
the
other
side
of
the
railings
they
were
silent
fascinated
by
the
men
in
khaki
standing
safe
behind
the
railing
they
stared
at
them
with
an
awful
sombre
curiosity
and
the
men
in
khaki
stared
back
proud
as
men
who
know
that
the
hour
is
great
and
that
it
is
their
hour
nicky
veronica
said
i
wish
michael
would
say
things
like
that
he
dead
right
ronny
that
is
the
way
to
take
it
getting
drunk
and
excited
and
rushing
about
making
silly
asses
of
themselves
they
rather
swine
you
know
yes
but
they
pathetic
ca
you
see
how
pathetic
they
are
nicky
i
believe
i
love
the
swine
even
the
poor
drunken
ones
with
the
pink
paper
feathers
just
because
they
english
because
awful
things
are
going
to
happen
to
them
and
they
do
know
it
they
english
you
think
god
made
us
all
like
that
he
they
found
anthony
in
the
mall
driving
up
and
down
looking
for
them
he
had
picked
up
dorothy
and
aunt
emmeline
and
uncle
morrie
we
going
down
to
the
mansion
house
he
said
to
hear
the
proclamation
will
you
come
but
veronica
and
nicholas
were
tired
of
crowds
even
of
historic
crowds
anthony
drove
off
with
his
and
they
went
home
i
never
saw
daddy
so
excited
nicky
said
but
anthony
was
not
excited
he
had
never
felt
calmer
or
cooler
in
his
life
he
returned
some
time
after
midnight
by
that
time
it
had
sunk
into
him
germany
defied
the
ultimatum
and
england
declared
war
on
germany
he
said
it
was
only
what
was
to
be
foreseen
he
had
known
all
the
time
that
it
would
happen
really
the
tension
of
the
day
of
the
ultimatum
had
this
peculiar
psychological
effect
that
all
over
england
people
who
had
declared
up
to
the
last
minute
that
there
would
be
no
war
were
saying
the
same
thing
as
anthony
and
believing
it
michael
was
disgusted
with
the
event
that
had
put
an
end
to
the
irish
revolution
it
was
in
this
form
that
he
conceived
his
first
grudge
against
the
war
this
emotion
of
his
was
like
some
empty
space
of
horror
opened
up
between
him
and
nicholas
nicky
being
the
only
one
of
his
family
who
was
as
yet
aware
of
its
existence
for
the
next
three
days
nicholas
very
serious
and
earnest
shut
himself
up
in
his
workshop
at
the
bottom
of
the
orchard
and
laboured
there
putting
the
last
touches
to
the
final
perfect
authoritative
form
of
the
moving
fortress
the
joint
creation
of
his
brain
and
drayton
the
only
experiment
that
had
survived
the
repeated
onslaughts
of
the
major
criticism
the
new
model
was
three
times
the
size
of
the
lost
original
it
was
less
like
a
battleship
and
more
like
a
and
a
destroyer
it
was
his
and
drayton
last
word
on
the
subject
of
armaments
it
was
going
to
the
war
office
this
time
addressed
to
the
right
person
and
accompanied
by
all
sorts
of
protective
introductions
and
drayton
blasting
its
way
before
it
with
his
new
explosive
in
those
three
days
nick
found
an
immense
distraction
in
his
moving
fortress
it
also
served
to
blind
his
family
to
his
real
intentions
he
knew
that
his
real
intentions
could
not
be
kept
from
them
very
long
meanwhile
the
idea
that
he
was
working
on
something
made
them
happy
when
frances
saw
him
in
his
overalls
she
smiled
and
said
nicky
got
job
anyhow
john
came
and
looked
at
him
through
the
window
of
the
workshop
and
laughed
good
old
nicky
he
said
doing
his
bit
in
those
three
days
john
went
about
with
an
air
of
agreeable
excitement
or
you
came
upon
him
sitting
in
solitary
places
like
the
lost
in
happy
thought
michael
said
of
him
that
he
was
unctuous
he
exuded
a
secret
joy
and
satisfaction
john
had
acquired
a
sudden
remarkable
maturity
he
shone
on
each
member
of
his
family
with
benevolence
and
affection
as
if
he
were
its
protector
and
consoler
and
about
to
confer
on
it
some
tremendous
benefit
look
at
michael
said
the
bloodthirsty
little
brute
positively
enjoying
the
war
you
might
leave
me
alone
said
i
sha
have
it
to
enjoy
for
long
he
was
one
of
those
who
believed
that
the
war
would
be
over
in
four
months
michael
pledged
to
secrecy
came
and
looked
at
the
moving
fortress
he
was
interested
and
intelligent
he
admired
that
efficiency
of
that
was
so
unlike
his
own
yet
he
wondered
after
all
was
it
so
unlike
he
too
was
aiming
at
an
art
as
clean
and
hard
and
powerful
as
nicky
as
naked
of
all
blazonry
and
decoration
an
art
which
would
attain
its
objective
by
the
simplest
most
perfect
adjustment
of
means
to
ends
and
anthony
was
proud
of
that
hidden
wonder
locked
behind
the
door
of
the
workshop
in
the
orchard
he
realized
that
his
son
nicholas
had
taken
part
in
a
great
and
important
thing
he
was
prouder
of
nicholas
than
he
had
been
of
michael
and
michael
knew
it
nicky
brains
could
be
used
for
the
service
of
his
country
but
michael
anthony
said
to
himself
that
there
was
any
sense
any
sense
that
he
could
endure
to
contemplate
in
which
michael
brains
could
be
of
any
use
to
his
country
when
anthony
thought
of
the
mobilization
of
his
family
for
national
service
michael
and
brains
were
a
problem
that
he
put
behind
him
for
the
present
and
refused
to
contemplate
there
would
be
time
enough
for
michael
later
anthony
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
his
own
one
talent
the
talent
which
had
made
harrison
and
harrison
the
biggest
firm
in
england
if
there
was
one
thing
he
understood
it
was
organization
if
there
was
one
thing
he
could
not
tolerate
it
was
waste
of
good
material
the
folly
of
forcing
men
and
women
into
places
they
were
not
fit
for
he
had
let
his
eldest
son
slip
out
of
the
business
without
a
pang
or
with
hardly
any
pang
he
had
only
taken
nicholas
into
it
as
an
experiment
it
was
on
john
that
he
relied
to
inherit
it
and
carry
it
farther
as
a
man
of
business
he
approved
of
the
advertised
formula
business
as
usual
he
understood
it
to
mean
that
the
duty
which
england
expected
every
man
to
do
was
to
stay
in
the
place
he
was
most
fitted
for
and
to
go
where
he
was
most
wanted
nothing
but
muddle
and
disaster
could
follow
any
departure
from
this
rule
it
was
fitting
that
frances
and
veronica
should
do
red
cross
work
it
was
fitting
that
dorothy
should
help
to
organize
the
relief
of
the
belgium
refugees
it
was
fitting
that
john
should
stay
at
home
and
carry
on
the
business
and
that
he
anthony
should
enlist
when
he
had
settled
john
into
his
place
it
was
above
all
fitting
that
nicky
should
devote
himself
to
the
invention
and
manufacture
of
armaments
he
could
not
conceive
anything
more
wantonly
and
scandalously
wasteful
than
a
system
that
could
make
any
other
use
of
nicky
brains
he
thanked
goodness
that
with
a
european
war
upon
us
such
a
system
if
it
existed
would
not
be
allowed
to
live
a
day
as
for
michael
it
might
be
fitting
later
very
much
later
perhaps
if
michael
wanted
to
volunteer
for
the
army
then
and
if
it
were
necessary
he
would
have
no
right
to
stop
him
but
it
would
not
be
necessary
england
was
going
to
win
this
war
on
the
sea
and
not
on
land
michael
was
practically
safe
and
behind
frances
smile
and
john
laughter
and
admiration
and
anthony
pride
there
was
the
thought
whatever
happens
nicky
will
he
safe
and
the
model
of
the
moving
fortress
was
packed
up
veronica
and
nicky
packed
it
and
it
was
sent
under
high
protection
to
the
war
office
and
nicky
unlocked
the
door
of
his
workshop
and
rested
restlessly
from
his
labour
and
there
was
a
call
for
recruits
and
for
still
more
recruits
westminster
bridge
became
a
highway
for
regiments
marching
to
battle
the
streets
were
for
squad
after
squad
of
volunteers
in
civilian
clothes
and
abashed
under
the
eyes
of
the
men
in
khaki
and
michael
said
this
is
the
end
of
all
the
arts
artists
will
not
be
allowed
to
exist
except
as
agents
for
the
recruiting
sergeant
we
dished
that
was
the
second
grudge
he
had
against
the
war
it
killed
the
arts
in
the
very
hour
of
their
renaissance
eccentricities
by
morton
ellis
with
illustrations
by
austin
mitchell
and
the
new
poems
of
michael
harrison
with
illustrations
by
austin
mitchell
were
to
have
come
out
in
september
but
it
was
not
conceivable
that
they
should
come
out
at
the
first
rumour
of
the
ultimatum
michael
and
ellis
had
given
themselves
up
for
lost
liége
fell
and
namur
was
falling
and
the
call
went
on
for
recruits
and
for
still
more
recruits
and
nicky
in
five
seconds
had
destroyed
his
mother
illusions
and
the
whole
fabric
of
his
father
plans
it
was
one
evening
when
they
were
in
the
sitting
up
after
veronica
had
gone
to
bed
i
hope
you
wo
mind
father
he
said
but
i
going
to
enlist
he
did
not
look
at
his
father
face
he
looked
at
his
mother
she
was
sitting
opposite
him
on
the
couch
beside
dorothy
john
balanced
himself
on
the
head
of
the
couch
with
his
arm
round
his
mother
shoulder
every
now
and
then
he
stooped
down
and
rubbed
his
cheek
thoughtfully
against
her
hair
a
slight
tremor
shook
her
sensitive
betraying
upper
lip
then
she
looked
back
at
nicholas
and
smiled
dorothy
set
her
mouth
hard
unsmiling
anthony
had
said
nothing
he
stared
before
him
at
michael
foot
thrust
out
and
tilted
by
the
crossing
of
his
knees
michael
foot
with
its
long
arched
instep
fascinated
anthony
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
if
i
look
at
it
long
enough
i
may
forget
what
nicky
has
said
i
hope
you
wo
mind
father
but
i
enlisting
too
john
voice
was
a
light
high
echo
of
nicky
with
a
great
effort
anthony
roused
himself
from
his
contemplation
of
michael
foot
i
ca
see
that
my
minding
or
not
minding
has
anything
to
do
with
it
he
brought
his
words
out
slowly
and
with
separate
efforts
as
if
they
weighed
heavily
on
his
tongue
we
got
to
consider
what
best
for
the
country
all
round
and
i
doubt
if
either
of
you
is
called
upon
to
go
some
of
us
have
got
to
go
said
nicky
quite
so
but
i
do
think
it
ought
to
be
you
nicky
or
john
either
i
suppose
said
michael
you
mean
it
ought
to
be
me
i
do
mean
anything
of
the
sort
one
out
of
four
enough
one
out
of
four
well
then
that
only
leaves
me
to
fight
said
dorothy
i
was
thinking
of
you
michael
or
of
dorothy
they
all
looked
at
him
where
he
sat
upright
and
noble
in
his
chair
and
most
absurdly
young
dorothy
said
under
her
breath
oh
you
darling
daddy
wo
be
allowed
to
go
anyhow
said
john
to
his
father
you
need
think
it
why
not
well
he
had
the
heart
to
say
because
you
too
old
nicky
brains
will
be
more
use
to
the
country
than
my
old
carcass
nicky
thought
you
the
very
last
of
us
that
can
be
spared
but
he
could
say
it
the
thing
was
so
obvious
all
he
said
was
it
out
of
the
question
your
going
old
nicky
out
of
the
question
if
you
like
said
john
he
going
to
be
married
he
ought
to
be
thinking
of
his
wife
and
children
of
course
he
ought
said
anthony
whoever
goes
first
it
nicky
you
ought
to
think
of
mummy
daddy
ducky
and
you
ought
to
think
of
said
dorothy
i
said
john
have
got
anybody
to
think
of
i
not
going
to
be
married
and
i
have
any
children
i
have
got
a
wife
and
children
yet
said
nicky
you
got
veronica
you
ought
to
think
of
her
i
am
thinking
of
her
you
do
suppose
veronica
stop
me
if
i
wanted
to
go
why
she
would
look
at
me
if
i
did
want
to
go
suddenly
he
remembered
michael
i
mean
he
said
after
my
that
i
was
going
their
eyes
met
michael
flickered
he
knew
that
nicky
was
thinking
of
him
then
ronny
knows
said
frances
of
course
she
knows
are
going
to
try
to
stop
me
mother
no
she
said
i
not
going
to
try
to
stop
you
this
time
she
thought
if
i
had
stopped
him
seven
years
ago
he
would
be
safe
now
with
the
army
in
india
one
by
one
they
got
up
and
said
good
night
to
each
other
but
nicholas
came
to
michael
in
his
room
he
said
to
him
i
say
mick
do
you
worry
about
not
enlisting
at
any
rate
do
worry
about
don
and
daddy
they
wo
take
don
because
he
got
a
mitral
murmur
in
his
heart
that
he
does
know
about
he
going
to
be
jolly
well
sold
poor
chap
and
they
wo
take
the
because
he
too
old
though
the
dear
old
thing
thinks
he
can
bluff
them
into
it
because
he
does
look
it
and
look
here
do
worry
about
me
as
far
as
i
concerned
the
a
blessing
in
disguise
i
always
wanted
to
go
into
the
army
you
know
how
i
loathed
it
when
they
went
and
stopped
me
now
i
going
in
and
nobody
not
even
mother
really
wants
to
keep
me
out
soon
they
all
be
as
pleased
as
punch
about
it
and
i
sort
of
know
how
you
feel
about
the
war
you
do
want
to
stick
bayonets
into
german
tummies
just
they
so
large
and
oodgy
you
think
of
that
first
and
all
the
time
and
afterwards
and
i
think
of
it
at
all
besides
you
disapprove
of
the
war
for
all
sorts
of
reasons
that
i
ca
get
hold
of
but
it
like
this
you
could
respect
yourself
if
you
went
into
it
and
i
could
respect
myself
if
i
stayed
out
i
wonder
michael
said
if
you
really
see
it
of
course
i
see
it
that
the
worst
of
you
clever
writing
chaps
you
seem
to
think
nobody
can
ever
see
anything
except
yourselves
when
he
had
left
him
michael
thought
i
wonder
if
he
really
does
see
or
if
he
made
it
all
up
they
had
not
said
to
each
other
all
that
they
had
really
meant
of
nicky
many
words
there
were
only
two
that
he
remembered
vividly
not
yet
again
he
felt
the
horror
of
the
great
empty
space
opened
up
between
him
and
nicky
deep
and
still
and
soundless
but
for
the
two
words
not
yet
xx
it
was
as
nicholas
had
said
anthony
and
john
were
rejected
anthony
on
account
of
his
age
john
because
of
the
mitral
murmur
that
he
know
about
the
had
lied
john
said
like
a
good
swore
he
was
under
and
stuck
to
it
he
might
have
had
a
chance
if
he
left
it
at
that
because
he
looked
a
jolly
sight
better
than
most
of
when
he
was
stripped
but
they
given
him
so
good
an
innings
that
the
poor
old
thing
got
above
himself
and
spun
them
a
yarn
about
his
hair
having
gone
grey
from
a
recent
shock
that
dished
him
they
said
they
knew
that
sort
of
hair
they
been
seeing
a
lot
of
it
lately
anthony
was
depressed
he
said
bitter
things
about
red
tape
and
declared
that
if
that
was
the
way
things
were
going
to
be
managed
it
was
a
bad
for
the
country
john
was
furious
he
said
the
man
who
examined
him
was
a
blasted
idiot
who
did
know
his
own
rotten
business
he
actually
had
the
beastly
cheek
to
tell
him
they
want
him
dropping
down
dead
when
he
went
into
action
or
fainting
from
sheer
excitement
after
they
been
to
the
trouble
and
expense
of
training
him
as
if
he
be
likely
to
do
a
damn
silly
thing
like
that
he
never
been
excited
in
his
life
it
was
enough
to
him
so
john
and
anthony
followed
the
example
of
their
women
and
joined
the
ambulance
classes
of
the
red
cross
and
presently
they
learned
to
their
disgust
that
though
they
might
possibly
be
accepted
as
volunteers
for
home
service
their
disabilities
would
keep
them
forever
from
the
front
at
this
point
anthony
attention
was
diverted
to
his
business
by
a
sudden
government
demand
for
timber
as
he
believed
that
the
war
would
be
over
in
four
months
he
did
not
at
first
realize
the
personal
significance
of
this
still
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
its
immediate
message
for
him
was
that
business
must
be
attended
to
he
had
not
attended
to
it
many
days
before
he
saw
that
his
work
for
his
country
lay
there
under
his
hand
in
his
offices
and
his
stackyards
and
factories
he
sighed
and
sat
down
to
it
and
turned
his
back
resolutely
on
the
glamour
of
the
front
the
particular
business
in
hand
had
great
issues
and
a
fascination
of
its
own
and
his
son
john
sat
down
to
it
beside
him
with
a
devoted
body
and
a
brain
alive
to
the
great
issues
but
with
an
ungovernable
and
abstracted
soul
and
nicky
a
recruit
in
kitchener
army
went
rapidly
through
the
first
courses
of
his
training
sleeping
under
canvas
marching
in
sun
and
wind
and
rain
digging
trenches
waist
high
breast
high
in
earth
till
his
clear
skin
grew
clearer
and
his
young
hard
body
harder
every
day
and
every
day
the
empty
spiritual
space
between
him
and
michael
widened
with
the
exception
of
michael
and
old
fleming
anthony
entire
family
had
offered
itself
to
its
country
it
was
mobilized
from
frances
and
anthony
down
to
the
very
aunties
in
those
days
there
were
few
red
cross
volunteers
who
were
not
sure
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
be
sent
to
the
front
their
only
fear
was
that
they
might
not
be
trained
and
ready
when
the
moment
of
the
summons
came
strong
young
girls
hustled
for
the
best
places
at
the
ambulance
classes
fragile
elderly
women
twitching
with
nervous
anxiety
contended
with
these
remorseless
ones
and
were
pushed
to
the
rear
yet
they
went
on
contending
sustained
by
their
extraordinary
illusion
aunt
louie
displaying
an
unexpected
and
premature
dexterity
with
bandages
was
convinced
that
she
would
be
sent
to
the
front
if
nobody
else
was
aunt
emmeline
and
aunt
edith
in
states
of
cerebral
excitement
while
still
struggling
to
find
each
other
arteries
declared
that
they
were
going
to
the
front
they
saw
no
earthly
reason
why
they
should
not
go
there
uncle
maurice
haunted
the
emergency
at
the
polytechnic
wearing
an
esmarch
triangular
bandage
round
his
neck
and
volunteered
as
an
instructor
he
got
mixed
up
with
his
bandages
and
finally
consented
to
the
use
of
his
person
as
a
for
practical
demonstrations
while
he
waited
for
his
orders
to
go
to
the
front
they
forebore
to
comment
on
the
palpable
absurdity
of
each
hopes
for
with
the
first
outbreak
of
the
war
the
three
miss
flemings
had
ceased
from
mutual
recrimination
they
were
shocked
into
a
curious
gentleness
to
each
other
every
evening
the
old
schoolroom
study
was
turned
into
a
red
cross
demonstration
hall
and
there
the
queer
sight
was
to
be
seen
of
louie
placable
and
tender
showing
edith
over
and
over
again
how
to
adjust
a
scalp
bandage
on
emmeline
head
and
of
emmeline
motionless
for
hours
under
edie
little
clumsy
pinching
fingers
it
was
thus
with
small
vibrations
of
tenderness
and
charity
that
they
responded
to
the
vast
rhythm
of
the
war
and
grannie
immutable
in
her
aged
wisdom
and
malevolence
pushed
out
her
lower
lip
at
them
if
you
three
would
leave
off
that
folly
and
sit
down
and
knit
you
might
be
some
use
said
grannie
kitchener
says
that
if
every
woman
in
england
knitted
from
morning
till
night
he
would
have
enough
socks
for
his
army
grannie
knitted
from
morning
till
night
she
knitted
conspicuously
as
a
protest
against
bandage
practice
giving
to
her
soft
and
gentle
action
an
air
of
energy
inimical
to
her
three
unmarried
daughters
and
not
even
louie
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
that
all
her
knitting
had
to
be
unravelled
overnight
to
save
the
wool
a
set
of
silly
women
getting
in
kitchener
way
and
wasting
khaki
grannie
behaved
as
if
the
war
were
her
private
and
personal
affair
as
if
kitchener
were
her
man
and
all
the
other
women
were
interfering
with
them
yet
it
looked
as
if
all
the
women
would
be
mobilized
before
all
the
men
the
gates
of
holloway
were
opened
and
blathwaite
and
her
followers
received
a
free
pardon
on
their
pledge
to
abstain
from
violence
during
the
period
of
the
war
and
instantly
in
the
first
week
of
war
the
suffrage
unions
and
leagues
and
societies
already
organized
and
disciplined
by
seven
years
methodical
resistance
presented
their
late
enemy
the
government
with
an
instrument
of
national
service
made
to
its
hand
and
none
the
worse
because
originally
devised
for
its
torture
and
embarassment
the
little
vortex
of
the
woman
movement
was
swept
without
a
sound
into
the
immense
vortex
of
the
war
the
women
rose
up
all
over
england
and
went
into
uniform
and
dorothea
appeared
one
day
wearing
the
khaki
tunic
breeches
and
puttees
of
the
women
service
corps
she
had
joined
a
as
chauffeur
driving
the
big
morss
car
that
anthony
had
given
to
it
dorothea
really
had
a
chance
of
being
sent
to
belgium
before
the
end
of
the
month
meanwhile
she
convoyed
belgian
refugees
from
cannon
street
station
she
saw
nothing
before
her
as
yet
her
mind
was
like
cannon
street
station
a
dreadful
twilit
terminus
into
which
all
the
horror
and
misery
of
belgium
poured
and
was
congested
cannon
street
station
presently
it
was
as
if
she
were
spending
all
of
her
life
that
counted
there
as
if
for
years
she
had
been
familiar
with
the
scene
arch
upon
iron
arch
and
girder
after
iron
girder
holding
up
the
blurred
transparency
of
the
roof
iron
rails
running
under
the
long
roof
that
was
like
the
roof
of
a
tunnel
open
at
one
end
by
day
a
greyish
light
filtered
through
smoke
and
grit
and
steam
lamps
opaque
white
globes
hanging
in
the
thick
air
like
dead
moons
by
night
a
bluish
light
and
large
white
globes
grown
opalescent
like
moons
lit
again
to
a
ghastly
ruinous
life
the
iron
breasts
of
engines
huge
and
triumphant
advancing
under
the
immense
fanlight
of
the
open
arch
long
trains
of
carriages
packed
tight
with
packages
with
enormous
bundles
human
heads
appearing
here
and
there
above
the
swollen
curves
of
the
bundles
human
bodies
emerging
in
the
struggle
to
bring
forth
the
bundles
through
the
narrow
doors
for
the
first
few
weeks
the
war
meant
to
dorothea
not
bleeding
wounds
and
death
but
just
these
of
refugees
just
this
one
incredible
spectacle
of
belgium
pouring
itself
into
cannon
street
station
her
clear
hard
mind
tried
and
failed
to
grasp
the
sequences
of
which
the
final
act
was
the
daily
unloading
of
tons
of
men
women
and
children
on
cannon
street
platform
yesterday
they
were
staggering
under
those
bundles
along
their
straight
flat
roads
between
the
everlasting
rows
of
poplars
their
towns
and
villages
flamed
and
smoked
behind
them
some
of
them
goaded
like
tired
cattle
had
felt
german
bayonets
at
their
backs
yesterday
and
this
morning
they
were
here
brave
and
gay
smiling
at
dorothea
as
she
carried
their
sick
on
her
stretcher
and
their
small
children
in
her
arms
and
they
were
still
proud
of
themselves
a
little
girl
tripped
along
the
platform
carrying
in
one
hand
a
large
pasteboard
box
covered
with
black
oilcloth
and
in
the
other
a
cage
with
a
goldfinch
in
it
she
looked
back
at
dorothea
and
smiled
proud
of
herself
because
she
had
saved
her
goldfinch
a
belgium
boy
carried
a
paralyzed
old
man
on
his
shoulders
he
grinned
at
dorothea
proud
of
himself
because
he
had
saved
his
grandfather
a
young
flemish
peasant
woman
pushed
back
the
shawl
that
covered
her
baby
face
to
show
her
how
pretty
he
was
she
laughed
because
she
had
borne
him
and
saved
him
and
there
were
terrible
things
significant
of
yesterday
women
and
girls
idiotic
with
outrage
and
grief
a
young
man
lamed
in
trying
to
throw
himself
into
a
moving
train
because
he
thought
his
lost
mother
was
in
it
the
ring
screening
the
agony
of
a
woman
giving
birth
to
her
child
on
the
platform
a
death
in
the
train
stiff
upturned
feet
at
the
end
of
a
stretcher
that
the
carried
away
and
as
dorothea
drove
her
of
refugees
day
after
day
in
perfect
safety
she
sickened
with
impatience
and
disgust
safety
was
hard
and
bitter
to
her
her
hidden
self
was
unsatisfied
it
had
a
monstrous
longing
it
wanted
to
go
where
the
guns
sounded
and
the
shells
burst
and
the
villages
flamed
and
smoked
to
go
along
the
straight
flat
roads
between
the
poplars
where
the
refugees
had
gone
so
that
her
nerves
and
flesh
should
know
and
feel
their
suffering
and
their
danger
she
was
not
feeling
anything
now
except
the
shame
of
her
immunity
she
thought
i
ca
look
at
a
belgian
woman
without
wishing
i
were
dead
i
shall
have
no
peace
till
i
gone
her
surface
self
was
purely
practical
she
thought
if
i
were
in
belgium
i
could
get
them
out
of
it
quicker
than
they
could
walk
dorothea
could
bring
all
her
mind
to
bear
on
her
belgians
because
it
was
at
ease
about
her
own
people
they
at
any
rate
were
safe
her
father
and
poor
don
were
out
of
it
michael
was
not
in
it
yet
though
of
course
he
would
be
in
it
some
time
she
tried
not
to
think
too
much
about
michael
nicky
was
safe
for
the
next
six
months
and
frank
was
safe
frank
was
training
recruits
he
had
told
her
he
might
be
kept
indefinitely
at
that
infernal
job
but
for
that
he
would
be
fighting
now
he
wanted
her
to
be
sorry
for
him
and
she
was
sorry
for
him
and
she
was
glad
too
one
afternoon
late
in
august
she
had
come
home
to
sleep
till
between
her
day
work
and
her
night
work
when
she
found
him
upstairs
in
her
study
he
had
been
there
an
hour
waiting
for
her
by
himself
the
others
were
all
at
bandage
practice
in
the
schoolroom
i
hope
you
do
mind
he
said
your
mother
told
me
to
wait
up
here
she
had
come
in
straight
from
the
garage
there
was
a
light
fur
of
dust
on
her
boots
and
on
the
shoulders
of
her
tunic
and
on
her
face
and
hair
her
hands
were
black
with
oil
and
dirt
from
her
car
he
looked
at
her
taking
it
all
in
the
khaki
uniform
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
in
it
the
tunic
breeches
and
puttees
the
loose
felt
hat
turned
up
at
one
side
its
funny
boyish
the
dust
and
dirt
of
her
and
he
smiled
his
smile
had
none
of
the
cynical
derision
which
had
once
greeted
her
appearances
as
a
militant
suffragist
and
yet
she
thought
if
he
consistent
he
ought
to
loathe
me
now
dorothea
going
to
the
war
he
said
not
worse
luck
are
you
going
as
part
of
the
canadian
contingent
from
overseas
or
what
i
wish
i
was
do
you
think
they
take
me
if
i
cut
my
hair
off
they
might
they
might
do
anything
this
is
a
most
extraordinary
war
it
a
war
that
makes
it
detestable
to
be
a
woman
i
thought
for
a
moment
his
old
ungovernable
devil
rose
in
him
what
did
you
think
no
matter
that
all
ancient
history
i
say
you
look
like
business
do
you
really
mean
it
are
you
really
going
to
flanders
do
you
suppose
any
woman
would
go
and
get
herself
up
like
this
if
she
was
going
he
said
surprisingly
i
do
see
what
wrong
with
it
and
then
it
makes
you
look
about
eighteen
that
because
you
ca
see
my
face
for
the
dirt
for
the
you
mean
dorothy
do
you
realize
that
you
not
eighteen
you
eight
and
twenty
i
do
she
said
but
i
rather
hoped
you
did
or
that
if
you
did
you
would
say
so
i
realize
that
i
and
that
between
us
we
made
a
pretty
mess
of
each
other
lives
have
i
made
a
mess
of
life
a
beastly
mess
i
sorry
i
would
have
done
it
for
the
world
if
i
known
you
know
i
would
but
one
does
know
things
one
does
if
one
dorothea
one
knows
some
things
awfully
well
but
not
the
things
that
matter
well
but
what
could
i
do
she
said
you
could
have
done
what
you
can
do
now
you
could
have
married
me
and
we
would
have
had
three
years
of
each
other
you
mean
three
centuries
there
was
a
reason
why
we
could
manage
it
there
was
a
reason
there
is
any
reason
now
look
here
wednesday
will
you
marry
me
on
friday
if
i
get
leave
and
a
licence
and
fix
it
up
tomorrow
we
shall
have
three
days
three
days
she
seemed
to
be
saying
to
herself
that
for
three
days
no
it
was
worth
while
well
three
months
perhaps
perhaps
six
if
my
rotten
luck
change
because
i
doing
my
level
best
to
make
it
change
so
you
see
it
got
to
be
one
thing
or
another
and
still
she
seemed
to
be
considering
was
it
or
was
it
not
worth
while
for
god
sake
do
say
you
going
to
make
conditions
there
really
is
time
for
it
you
can
think
what
you
like
and
say
what
you
like
and
do
what
you
like
and
wear
anything
wear
a
busby
i
sha
care
if
you
only
marry
me
yes
that
the
way
you
go
on
and
yet
you
do
say
you
love
me
you
never
have
said
it
you
you
leaving
me
to
do
all
that
why
what
else
have
i
been
doing
for
seven
years
nine
years
ten
years
nothing
nothing
at
all
you
just
seem
to
think
that
i
can
go
off
and
get
married
to
a
man
without
knowing
whether
he
cares
for
me
or
not
and
now
it
too
late
my
hands
are
all
dirty
so
my
face
filthy
you
must
i
do
care
they
your
hands
it
your
face
i
do
care
the
the
absurd
fretted
his
mouth
he
laughed
he
said
she
takes
her
hat
off
when
she
goes
into
a
scrimmage
and
she
keeps
it
on
she
loosened
the
strap
laughing
and
threw
her
hat
the
hat
of
a
canadian
trooper
on
to
the
floor
his
mouth
moved
over
her
face
over
her
hair
pressing
hard
into
their
softness
his
arms
clasped
her
shoulders
they
slipped
to
her
waist
he
strained
her
slender
body
fast
to
him
straight
against
his
own
straightness
till
the
passion
and
the
youth
she
had
denied
and
destroyed
shook
her
he
said
to
himself
she
come
alive
she
feel
she
me
i
make
her
i
should
have
thought
of
this
ten
years
ago
her
face
was
smooth
it
smiled
under
the
touch
of
his
mouth
and
hands
and
fear
came
with
her
passion
she
thought
supposing
something
happens
before
friday
if
i
could
only
give
myself
to
him
now
then
very
gently
and
very
tenderly
he
released
her
as
if
he
knew
what
she
was
thinking
he
was
sorry
for
her
and
afraid
poor
dorothy
who
had
made
such
a
beastly
mess
of
it
who
had
come
alive
so
late
she
thought
but
he
would
take
me
that
way
he
loathe
me
if
he
knew
yet
surely
there
was
the
same
fear
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
they
were
sitting
beside
each
other
now
talking
quietly
her
face
and
hands
were
washed
clean
as
clean
she
said
as
they
ever
would
be
when
i
think
he
said
of
the
years
we
wasted
i
wonder
if
there
was
anything
that
could
have
prevented
it
only
your
saying
what
you
said
now
that
it
did
matter
that
it
made
no
difference
to
you
what
i
did
but
you
see
it
made
all
the
difference
and
there
we
were
it
did
really
she
shook
her
head
we
thought
it
did
no
do
you
remember
that
morning
i
fetched
you
from
holloway
yes
and
she
said
as
he
had
said
then
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
except
that
it
was
dear
of
you
and
yet
it
was
from
that
morning
from
that
we
seemed
to
go
wrong
there
something
i
wanted
most
awfully
to
say
if
you
could
stand
going
back
to
it
for
just
one
second
do
you
remember
saying
that
i
did
care
that
i
never
thought
of
you
when
you
were
in
prison
or
wondered
what
you
were
feeling
what
put
me
off
it
hurt
so
atrociously
that
i
could
say
anything
it
was
true
that
i
did
think
about
you
i
thought
about
nothing
else
when
i
was
working
i
nearly
went
off
my
head
with
thinking
and
you
said
i
did
listen
to
what
you
told
me
that
was
true
i
was
listening
like
anything
darling
what
did
i
tell
you
oh
about
the
thing
you
called
your
experience
or
your
adventure
or
something
my
adventure
that
what
you
called
it
a
sort
of
dream
you
had
in
prison
i
could
say
anything
because
i
was
stupid
it
was
beyond
me
beyond
me
now
never
mind
my
adventure
what
does
it
matter
it
matters
awfully
because
i
could
see
that
it
meant
something
big
and
important
that
i
could
get
the
hang
of
it
used
to
bother
me
i
kept
on
trying
to
get
it
and
not
getting
it
you
poor
dear
and
i
forgotten
it
it
did
feel
frightfully
big
and
important
and
real
at
the
time
and
now
it
as
if
it
had
happened
to
somebody
else
to
veronica
or
somebody
not
me
it
was
much
more
like
veronica
i
do
understand
the
rest
of
that
business
now
i
mean
i
own
i
did
at
the
time
it
all
over
frank
and
forgotten
swallowed
up
in
the
war
you
not
swallowed
up
perhaps
i
shall
be
well
if
you
are
if
i
am
all
the
more
reason
why
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
understand
what
you
were
driving
at
it
was
this
way
was
it
you
got
to
fight
just
as
i
got
to
fight
you
could
keep
out
of
it
any
more
than
i
can
keep
out
of
this
war
you
could
stay
out
just
for
me
any
more
than
i
can
stay
out
for
just
you
and
in
a
sort
of
way
i
in
it
for
you
and
in
a
sort
of
way
you
were
in
it
in
that
damnable
suffrage
business
for
me
how
clever
of
you
she
said
to
see
it
i
did
see
it
then
he
said
simply
because
there
was
a
war
on
we
both
had
to
pay
for
my
stupidity
and
mine
and
my
cowardice
i
ought
to
have
trusted
you
to
see
or
risked
it
we
should
have
had
three
no
two
years
well
anyhow
we
got
this
evening
we
have
i
got
to
drive
belgians
from
nine
till
past
midnight
we
got
friday
suppose
they
give
me
leave
to
get
married
in
i
say
how
about
evening
i
ca
yes
i
can
at
least
i
shall
there
a
girl
i
know
drive
for
me
they
have
to
give
me
leave
to
get
married
in
too
she
thought
i
ca
go
to
flanders
now
unless
he
sent
out
if
he
is
nothing
shall
stop
me
but
his
coming
back
again
it
seemed
to
her
only
fair
and
fitting
that
they
should
snatch
at
their
happiness
and
secure
it
before
their
hour
came
she
tried
to
turn
her
mind
from
the
fact
that
at
mons
the
british
line
was
being
pressed
back
and
back
it
would
recover
of
course
it
would
recover
we
always
began
like
that
we
went
back
to
go
forwards
faster
when
we
got
into
our
stride
the
next
evening
thursday
the
girl
she
knew
drove
for
dorothea
when
frances
was
dressing
for
dinner
her
daughter
came
to
her
with
two
frocks
over
her
arm
mummy
ducky
she
said
i
think
my
head
going
i
ca
tell
whether
to
wear
the
white
thing
or
the
blue
thing
and
i
feel
as
if
it
mattered
more
than
anything
more
than
anything
on
earth
frances
considered
it
dorothea
in
her
uniform
and
the
white
frock
and
the
blue
frock
it
does
matter
a
little
bit
she
said
if
he
could
propose
to
you
in
that
ca
you
see
that
i
want
to
make
up
for
and
for
all
the
things
he
missed
the
things
i
have
given
him
if
only
i
was
as
beautiful
as
you
mummy
it
would
matter
my
dear
my
dear
dorothy
had
never
been
a
pathetic
child
not
half
so
pathetic
as
nicky
with
his
recklessness
and
his
earache
but
this
dorothy
in
khaki
breeches
with
her
talk
about
white
frocks
and
blue
frocks
made
frances
want
to
cry
frank
was
late
and
just
before
dinner
he
telephoned
to
dorothy
that
he
could
be
with
her
before
nine
and
that
he
would
only
have
one
hour
to
give
her
frances
and
anthony
looked
at
each
other
but
dorothy
looked
at
veronica
what
the
matter
ronny
you
look
simply
awful
do
i
my
head
splitting
i
think
i
go
and
lie
down
you
better
go
straight
to
bed
said
frances
and
let
nanna
bring
you
some
hot
soup
but
veronica
did
not
want
nanna
and
hot
soup
she
only
wanted
to
take
herself
and
her
awful
look
away
out
of
dorothy
sight
well
said
anthony
if
she
going
to
worry
herself
sick
about
nicky
now
frances
knew
that
she
was
not
worrying
about
nicky
it
was
nine
at
any
minute
now
frank
might
be
there
dorothy
thought
supposing
he
has
got
leave
but
she
knew
that
was
not
likely
if
he
had
got
leave
he
would
have
said
so
when
he
telephoned
the
hour
that
was
coming
had
the
colour
of
yesterday
he
would
hold
her
in
his
arms
again
till
she
trembled
and
then
he
would
be
afraid
and
she
would
be
afraid
and
he
would
let
her
go
the
bell
rang
the
garden
gate
swung
open
his
feet
were
loud
and
quick
on
the
flagged
path
of
the
terrace
he
came
into
the
room
to
them
holding
himself
rather
stiffly
and
very
upright
his
eyes
shone
with
excitement
he
laughed
the
laugh
she
loved
that
narrowed
his
eyes
and
jerked
his
mouth
slightly
crooked
they
all
spoke
at
once
you
got
leave
got
it
all
right
what
kept
you
you
got
leave
his
eyes
still
shone
his
mouth
still
jerked
laughing
well
no
he
said
that
what
i
have
got
in
fact
i
lucky
to
be
here
at
all
nanna
came
in
with
the
coffee
he
took
his
cup
from
her
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
beside
frances
stirring
his
coffee
with
his
spoon
and
smiling
as
if
at
something
pleasant
that
he
knew
something
that
he
would
tell
them
presently
when
nanna
left
the
room
the
door
closed
softly
behind
her
he
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
for
the
click
of
the
latch
funny
chaps
he
said
meditatively
they
keep
putting
you
off
till
you
come
and
tell
them
you
want
to
get
married
then
they
say
they
sorry
but
your
marching
orders
are
fixed
for
that
day
twelve
hours
is
much
notice
to
give
a
fellow
he
had
not
looked
at
dorothy
he
had
not
spoken
to
her
he
was
speaking
to
anthony
and
john
and
frances
who
were
asking
questions
about
trains
and
boats
and
his
kit
and
his
people
he
looked
as
if
he
were
not
conscious
of
dorothy
eyes
fixed
on
him
as
he
sat
slowly
stirring
his
coffee
without
drinking
it
the
vibration
of
her
nerves
made
his
answers
sound
muffled
and
she
knew
that
her
hour
was
dwindling
slowly
wasting
passing
from
her
minute
by
minute
as
they
talked
she
had
an
intolerable
longing
to
be
alone
with
him
to
be
taken
in
his
arms
to
feel
what
she
had
felt
yesterday
it
was
as
if
her
soul
stood
still
there
in
yesterday
and
refused
to
move
on
into
yet
she
was
glad
of
their
talking
it
put
off
the
end
when
they
stopped
talking
and
got
up
and
left
her
alone
with
him
that
would
be
the
end
suddenly
he
looked
straight
at
her
his
hands
trembled
the
cup
he
had
not
drunk
from
rattled
in
its
saucer
it
seemed
to
dorothea
that
for
a
moment
the
whole
room
was
hushed
to
listen
to
that
small
sound
she
saw
her
mother
take
the
cup
from
him
and
set
it
on
the
table
one
by
one
they
got
up
and
slunk
out
of
the
room
as
if
they
were
guilty
and
left
her
alone
with
him
it
was
not
like
yesterday
he
did
not
take
her
in
his
arms
he
sat
there
looking
at
her
rather
anxiously
keeping
his
distance
he
seemed
to
be
wondering
how
she
was
going
to
take
it
he
thought
i
made
a
mess
of
it
again
it
was
fair
to
make
her
want
me
when
i
might
have
known
i
ought
to
have
left
it
and
suddenly
her
soul
swung
round
released
from
yesterday
she
knew
what
he
had
wanted
yesterday
that
her
senses
should
be
ready
to
follow
where
her
heart
led
but
that
was
not
the
readiness
he
required
from
her
rather
it
was
what
his
anxious
eyes
implored
her
to
put
away
from
her
there
was
something
more
he
was
going
to
say
the
obvious
things
the
well
this
is
hard
luck
on
both
of
us
you
must
be
brave
do
make
it
too
hard
for
me
she
could
have
made
it
intolerable
it
was
that
he
knew
she
was
brave
he
knew
she
would
make
it
hard
for
him
he
knew
he
had
got
to
say
the
obvious
things
there
was
something
more
something
tremendous
it
came
to
her
with
the
power
and
sweetness
of
first
passion
but
without
its
fear
she
no
longer
wanted
him
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
hold
her
as
he
had
held
her
yesterday
her
swinging
soul
was
steady
it
vibrated
to
an
intenser
rhythm
she
knew
nothing
now
but
that
what
she
saw
was
real
and
that
they
were
seeing
it
together
it
was
reality
itself
it
was
more
than
they
when
realization
passed
it
would
endure
never
as
long
as
they
lived
would
they
be
able
to
speak
of
it
to
say
to
each
other
what
it
was
they
felt
and
saw
he
said
i
shall
have
to
go
soon
and
she
said
i
know
is
there
anything
i
can
do
i
wish
you
go
and
see
my
mother
some
time
she
like
it
i
should
love
to
go
and
see
her
what
else
well
i
no
business
to
ask
you
but
i
wish
you
give
it
up
i
give
anything
up
but
what
that
ambulance
of
yours
that
going
to
get
into
the
firing
line
oh
i
know
why
you
want
to
get
there
you
want
to
tackle
the
hardest
and
most
dangerous
job
naturally
but
it
wo
make
it
easier
for
us
to
win
the
war
you
ca
expect
us
to
fight
so
comfy
and
to
be
killed
so
comfy
if
we
know
our
womenkind
are
being
pounded
to
bits
in
the
ground
we
just
cleared
if
i
thought
were
knocking
about
anywhere
there
it
would
make
it
too
hard
it
would
make
me
jumpy
the
chances
are
i
should
have
much
time
to
think
about
it
but
when
i
did
you
think
might
have
spared
me
yes
and
you
might
think
of
your
people
it
bad
enough
for
them
nicky
going
it
is
only
that
i
have
liked
to
be
where
you
be
and
where
he
be
that
was
natural
it
also
natural
that
we
should
like
to
find
you
here
when
we
come
back
i
was
thinking
of
those
belgian
women
and
the
babies
and
england
so
safe
frank
so
disgustingly
safe
i
know
leaving
the
children
in
the
burning
house
she
had
said
that
once
and
he
had
remembered
you
can
do
more
for
them
by
staying
in
england
i
asking
you
to
take
the
hardest
job
really
it
is
if
it
what
you
want
most
he
had
risen
he
was
going
his
hands
were
on
her
shoulders
and
they
were
still
discussing
it
as
if
it
were
the
most
momentous
thing
of
course
she
said
i
wo
go
if
you
feel
like
that
about
it
i
want
you
to
fight
comfy
you
must
worry
about
me
nor
you
about
me
i
shall
be
all
right
remember
it
war
too
it
the
biggest
fight
for
freedom
i
know
she
said
and
then
have
you
got
all
your
things
somebody
got
i
have
given
you
anything
you
must
have
my
she
unstrapped
the
leather
band
and
put
it
on
him
my
wrist
a
whopper
so
mine
it
just
meet
at
the
last
hole
it
phosphorous
she
said
you
can
see
the
time
by
it
in
the
dark
i
nothing
for
except
he
fumbled
in
his
pockets
i
say
here
the
they
laughed
what
more
could
you
want
she
said
he
put
it
on
her
finger
she
raised
her
face
to
him
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
he
held
her
for
a
minute
in
his
arms
but
it
was
not
like
yesterday
suddenly
his
face
stiffened
tell
them
he
said
that
i
going
the
british
were
retreating
from
mons
the
german
attack
was
not
like
the
advance
of
an
army
but
like
the
travelling
of
an
earthquake
the
bursting
of
a
there
was
no
end
to
the
grey
battalions
no
end
to
the
german
army
no
end
to
the
german
people
and
there
was
no
news
of
british
reinforcements
or
rumour
of
reinforcements
they
come
on
like
waves
like
waves
said
dorothea
reading
from
the
papers
i
would
read
about
it
if
i
were
you
darling
said
frances
why
not
it
is
going
to
last
long
we
rally
see
if
we
do
dorothea
clear
hard
mind
had
gone
under
for
the
time
given
way
before
that
inconceivable
advance
she
did
believe
in
the
retreat
from
mons
it
could
go
on
reinforcements
had
been
sent
of
course
they
had
been
sent
if
frank
was
ordered
off
at
twelve
notice
that
meant
reinforcements
or
there
would
be
any
sense
in
it
they
would
stop
the
retreat
we
were
sitting
here
safe
and
the
least
we
could
do
for
was
to
trust
them
and
not
believe
any
tales
of
their
retreating
and
all
the
time
she
wondered
how
news
of
him
would
come
by
wire
by
letter
by
telephone
she
was
glad
that
she
had
got
to
wait
at
home
listening
for
the
clanging
of
the
garden
gate
the
knock
the
ringing
of
the
bell
she
waited
five
days
and
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
the
message
came
from
his
mother
to
her
mother
tell
your
dear
child
for
me
that
my
son
was
killed
five
days
ago
in
the
retreat
from
mons
and
ask
her
to
come
and
see
me
but
not
just
yet
she
had
enclosed
copies
of
the
official
telegram
and
the
letter
from
his
colonel
after
mons
the
siege
of
antwerp
the
refugees
poured
into
cannon
street
station
dorothea
tried
hard
to
drown
her
grief
in
the
grief
of
belgium
but
she
could
not
drown
it
she
could
only
poison
it
with
thoughts
that
turned
it
into
something
more
terrible
than
grief
they
came
to
her
regularly
beginning
after
midnight
when
she
lay
in
bed
and
should
have
slept
worn
out
with
her
hard
day
driving
she
thought
i
could
bear
it
if
i
had
wasted
the
time
we
might
have
had
together
all
those
years
like
a
fool
over
that
silly
suffrage
i
could
bear
it
if
i
had
been
cruel
to
him
i
talked
to
him
like
a
brute
and
an
idiot
i
told
him
he
did
care
for
freedom
and
he
died
for
it
he
remembered
that
it
was
one
of
the
last
things
he
remembered
he
said
war
it
the
biggest
fight
for
freedom
and
killed
in
it
i
could
bear
it
if
i
given
myself
to
him
that
night
even
for
one
night
how
do
you
know
he
have
loathed
it
i
ought
to
have
risked
it
i
was
a
coward
he
got
nothing
his
persistent
image
in
her
memory
tortured
her
it
was
an
illusion
that
prolonged
her
sense
of
his
material
presence
urging
it
towards
a
contact
that
was
never
reached
death
had
no
power
over
this
illusion
she
could
not
see
drayton
face
dead
among
the
dead
obsessed
by
her
illusion
she
had
lost
her
hold
on
the
reality
that
they
had
seen
and
felt
together
all
sense
of
it
was
gone
as
if
she
had
dreamed
it
or
made
it
up
presently
she
would
not
have
her
work
to
keep
her
from
thinking
the
ambulance
corps
was
going
out
to
flanders
at
the
end
of
september
and
it
would
take
her
car
with
it
and
a
new
driver
frances
heart
ached
when
she
looked
at
her
if
i
could
only
help
you
you
ca
mummy
ducky
she
would
say
and
she
would
get
up
and
leave
the
room
where
frances
was
sometimes
she
would
go
to
veronica
but
more
often
she
hid
away
somewhere
by
herself
frances
thought
she
is
out
of
my
reach
i
ca
get
at
her
she
go
to
anybody
rather
than
to
me
it
used
to
be
rosalind
now
veronica
but
dorothy
could
not
speak
about
drayton
to
her
mother
only
to
veronica
trying
to
comfort
her
she
said
i
could
bear
it
if
he
been
killed
in
an
attack
but
to
go
straight
like
that
into
the
retreat
he
could
have
had
five
hours
fighting
and
to
be
killed
retreating
he
got
nothing
out
of
it
but
agony
veronica
said
how
do
you
know
he
got
nothing
out
of
it
you
do
know
what
he
may
have
got
in
the
last
minute
of
it
ronny
i
do
believe
i
should
mind
so
much
if
i
were
going
out
to
flanders
if
there
was
the
least
little
chance
of
a
bullet
getting
me
but
i
gave
him
my
word
i
would
go
do
you
think
i
bound
by
that
now
now
you
more
bound
than
ever
because
he
more
near
you
more
alive
you
would
say
that
if
you
loved
him
one
day
a
package
came
to
her
from
eltham
two
notes
were
enclosed
with
it
one
from
drayton
mother
and
one
from
drayton
frank
said
i
was
to
send
you
this
if
he
was
killed
i
think
he
must
have
known
that
he
would
not
come
back
my
dear
dorothy
you
will
think
this
is
a
very
singular
bequest
but
i
want
you
to
see
that
my
memory
is
fairly
good
the
very
singular
bequest
was
a
bible
with
three
for
markers
and
a
date
on
the
july
the
referred
her
to
psalm
and
isaiah
xxxv
and
and
pencil
marks
to
the
verses
blessed
be
the
lord
my
strength
which
teacheth
my
hands
to
war
and
my
fingers
to
and
an
highway
shall
be
there
the
redeemed
shall
walk
there
and
the
ransomed
of
the
lord
shall
return
they
that
wait
upon
the
lord
shall
renew
their
strength
they
shall
mount
up
with
wings
as
eagles
they
shall
run
and
not
be
weary
they
shall
walk
and
not
faint
and
their
last
hour
came
back
to
her
with
its
mysterious
sweet
and
powerful
passion
that
had
no
fear
in
it
and
she
laid
hold
again
on
the
reality
they
had
seen
and
felt
together
the
moment
passed
she
wanted
it
to
come
back
for
as
long
as
it
lasted
she
was
at
peace
but
it
did
not
come
back
nothing
came
back
but
her
anguish
of
remorse
for
all
that
she
had
wasted
xxi
after
drayton
death
frances
and
anthony
were
sobered
and
had
ceased
to
feed
on
illusions
the
battle
of
the
marne
was
fought
in
vain
for
them
they
did
not
believe
that
it
had
saved
paris
then
came
the
fall
of
antwerp
and
the
great
retreat
there
was
no
more
belgium
the
fall
of
paris
and
the
taking
of
calais
were
only
a
question
of
time
of
perhaps
a
very
little
time
then
there
would
be
no
more
france
they
were
face
to
face
with
the
further
possibility
of
there
being
no
more
england
in
those
months
of
september
and
october
anthony
and
frances
were
changed
utterly
to
themselves
and
to
each
other
if
before
the
war
frances
had
been
asked
whether
she
loved
england
she
would
after
careful
consideration
have
replied
truthfully
i
like
england
but
i
dislike
the
english
people
they
are
narrow
and
hypocritical
and
conceited
they
are
snobbish
and
i
hate
snobs
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
beyond
thinking
that
the
british
ought
to
win
and
that
they
would
win
and
feeling
a
little
spurt
as
of
personal
satisfaction
when
they
did
win
she
had
had
no
consciousness
of
her
country
whatsoever
as
for
loving
it
she
loved
her
children
and
her
husband
and
she
had
a
sort
of
mild
affection
for
her
garden
and
her
tree
of
heaven
and
her
house
but
the
idea
of
loving
england
was
absurd
you
might
just
as
well
talk
of
loving
the
archbishopric
of
canterbury
she
who
once
sat
in
peace
under
the
tree
of
heaven
with
her
newspaper
and
flicked
the
affairs
of
the
nation
from
her
as
less
important
than
the
stitching
on
her
baby
frock
now
talked
and
thought
and
dreamed
of
nothing
else
she
was
sad
not
because
her
son
nicholas
time
of
safety
was
dwindling
week
by
week
but
because
england
was
in
danger
she
was
worried
not
because
lord
kitchener
was
practically
asking
her
to
give
up
her
son
michael
but
because
she
had
found
that
the
race
was
to
the
swift
and
the
battle
to
the
strong
and
that
she
was
classed
with
her
incompetent
sisters
as
too
old
to
wait
on
wounded
soldiers
every
morning
she
left
her
household
to
old
nanna
care
and
went
down
to
the
city
with
anthony
and
worked
till
evening
in
a
room
behind
his
office
receiving
packing
and
sending
off
great
cases
of
food
and
clothing
to
the
belgian
soldiers
anthony
was
sad
and
worried
not
because
he
had
three
sons
all
well
under
but
simply
and
solely
because
the
government
persisted
in
buying
the
wrong
kind
of
timber
timber
that
swelled
and
shrank
again
for
rifles
and
and
because
officials
would
listen
to
him
when
he
tried
to
tell
them
what
he
knew
about
timber
and
because
the
head
of
a
department
had
talked
to
about
private
firms
and
profiteering
as
if
any
man
with
three
sons
under
would
want
to
make
a
profit
out
of
the
war
and
as
if
they
could
cut
down
everybody
profits
if
they
took
the
trouble
they
might
cut
his
to
the
last
cent
so
long
as
we
had
that
would
carry
guns
and
rifles
that
would
shoot
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
and
they
did
and
frances
said
he
was
right
he
always
had
been
right
she
who
had
once
been
impatient
over
his
invariable
irritating
rightness
loved
it
now
she
thought
and
said
that
if
there
were
a
few
men
like
anthony
at
the
head
of
departments
we
should
win
the
war
we
were
losing
it
for
want
of
precisely
that
specialized
knowledge
and
that
power
of
organization
in
which
anthony
excelled
she
was
proud
of
him
not
because
he
was
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
children
but
because
he
was
a
man
who
could
help
england
they
were
both
proud
of
michael
and
nicholas
and
john
not
because
they
were
their
sons
but
because
they
were
men
who
could
fight
for
england
they
found
that
they
loved
england
with
a
secret
religious
instinctive
love
two
feet
of
english
earth
the
ground
that
a
man
might
stand
and
fight
for
became
mysteriously
and
magically
dearer
to
them
than
their
home
they
loved
england
more
than
their
own
life
or
the
lives
of
their
children
long
ago
they
had
realized
that
fathers
do
not
beget
children
nor
mothers
bear
them
merely
to
gratify
themselves
now
in
september
and
october
they
were
realizing
that
children
are
not
begotten
and
born
for
their
own
profit
and
pleasure
either
when
they
sat
together
after
the
day
work
they
found
themselves
saying
the
most
amazing
things
to
each
other
anthony
said
downham
thinks
john
heart
is
decidedly
better
i
should
wonder
if
he
have
to
go
almost
as
if
the
idea
had
been
pleasant
to
him
and
frances
well
i
suppose
if
we
had
thirteen
sons
instead
of
three
we
ought
to
send
them
all
positively
said
anthony
i
believe
i
let
dorothy
go
out
now
if
she
insisted
oh
no
i
think
we
might
be
allowed
to
keep
dorothy
she
pondered
i
suppose
one
will
get
used
to
it
in
time
i
grudged
giving
nicky
at
first
i
do
grudge
him
now
i
believe
if
he
went
out
and
was
killed
i
should
only
feel
how
splendid
it
was
of
him
i
wish
poor
dorothy
could
feel
that
way
about
drayton
she
does
really
but
that
different
frank
had
to
go
it
was
his
profession
nicky
gone
in
of
his
own
free
will
he
did
not
remind
her
that
frank
free
will
had
counted
in
his
choice
of
a
profession
once
said
frances
volunteers
did
count
now
they
count
more
than
the
whole
army
put
together
they
were
silent
each
thinking
the
same
thing
each
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
they
must
speak
of
it
frances
was
the
braver
of
the
two
she
spoke
first
there
michael
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
him
he
does
seem
to
want
to
go
that
was
the
vulnerable
place
there
they
had
ached
unbearably
in
secret
it
was
no
use
trying
to
hide
it
any
longer
something
must
be
done
about
michael
i
wish
you
say
something
to
him
anthony
i
would
if
i
were
going
myself
but
how
can
i
when
he
knows
that
you
have
gone
before
any
of
them
if
you
were
young
enough
i
ca
say
anything
you
have
to
no
anthony
i
ca
ask
him
to
go
any
more
than
you
can
nicky
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
any
right
to
or
dorothy
dorothy
be
in
the
trenches
now
if
she
had
her
way
i
ca
think
how
he
can
bear
to
look
at
dorothy
but
in
the
end
she
did
say
something
she
went
to
him
in
his
room
upstairs
where
he
worked
now
hiding
himself
away
every
evening
out
of
their
sight
almost
she
thought
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
her
heart
ached
as
she
looked
at
him
at
the
fair
serious
beauty
of
his
young
face
at
the
thick
masses
of
his
hair
that
would
not
stay
as
they
were
brushed
back
but
fell
over
his
forehead
it
was
still
yellow
and
shining
as
it
shone
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
was
writing
she
could
see
the
short
irregular
lines
of
verse
on
the
white
paper
he
covered
them
with
his
hand
as
she
came
in
lest
she
should
see
them
that
hurt
her
michael
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
realize
that
we
are
at
war
the
war
is
a
positive
obsession
to
me
if
that
what
you
mean
it
is
what
i
mean
only
that
when
other
people
are
doing
so
much
george
vereker
enlisted
yesterday
i
do
care
what
other
people
are
doing
i
never
did
if
george
vereker
chooses
to
enlist
it
is
no
reason
why
i
should
my
darling
mick
i
not
so
sure
is
it
all
the
more
reason
when
so
much
more
has
been
done
for
you
than
was
ever
done
for
him
it
no
use
trying
to
get
at
me
england
fighting
for
her
life
said
frances
so
germany
you
see
i
ca
feel
it
like
other
people
george
vereker
hates
germany
i
do
i
lived
there
i
do
want
to
make
dear
old
frau
henschel
a
widow
and
stick
a
bayonet
into
ludwig
and
carl
and
make
hedwig
and
löttchen
cry
i
see
you
rather
carl
and
ludwig
stuck
bayonets
into
george
and
nicky
and
that
ronny
and
dorothy
and
alice
lathom
cried
bayonetting
is
my
business
your
own
safety
is
how
can
you
bear
to
let
other
men
fight
for
you
they
not
fighting
for
mother
you
ask
them
if
they
are
and
see
what
they
say
to
you
they
fighting
for
god
knows
what
but
they
no
more
fighting
for
me
than
they
fighting
for
aunt
emmeline
they
fighting
for
aunt
emmeline
they
fighting
for
everything
that
weak
and
defenceless
well
then
they
not
fighting
for
me
i
not
weak
and
defenceless
said
michael
all
the
more
shame
for
you
then
he
smiled
acknowledging
her
score
you
do
mean
that
really
mummy
you
could
resist
the
opening
for
a
repartee
it
was
quite
a
nice
one
if
she
said
you
were
only
something
but
you
go
on
with
your
own
things
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
doing
something
i
keeping
sane
and
i
keeping
sanity
alive
in
other
people
much
you
care
for
other
people
said
frances
as
she
left
the
room
but
when
she
had
shut
the
door
on
him
her
heart
turned
to
him
again
she
went
down
to
anthony
where
he
waited
for
her
in
his
room
he
said
it
no
use
he
wo
go
and
frances
quite
suddenly
and
to
her
own
surprise
burst
into
tears
he
drew
her
to
him
and
she
clung
to
him
sobbing
softly
my
dear
my
dear
you
must
take
it
to
heart
like
this
he
as
obstinate
as
the
devil
but
he
come
round
he
pressed
her
tighter
to
him
he
loved
her
in
her
unfamiliar
weakness
crying
and
clinging
to
him
it
not
that
she
said
recovering
herself
with
dignity
i
glad
he
did
give
in
if
he
went
out
and
anything
happened
to
him
i
bear
to
be
the
one
who
made
him
go
after
all
she
did
love
england
more
than
michael
they
were
silent
we
must
leave
it
to
his
own
feeling
she
said
presently
but
anthony
heart
was
hard
against
michael
he
must
know
that
feeling
pretty
strong
against
him
to
say
nothing
of
feeling
and
feeling
he
did
know
it
he
knew
that
they
were
all
against
him
his
father
and
his
mother
and
john
and
dorothy
because
he
could
bear
to
look
at
dorothy
and
could
bear
dorothy
to
look
at
him
he
kept
out
of
her
way
as
much
as
possible
as
for
public
opinion
it
had
always
been
against
him
and
he
against
it
but
anthony
was
mistaken
when
he
thought
that
the
pressure
of
these
antagonisms
would
move
michael
an
inch
from
the
way
he
meant
to
go
rather
it
drew
out
that
resistance
which
michael
mind
had
always
offered
to
the
loathsome
violences
of
the
collective
soul
from
his
very
first
encounters
with
the
collective
soul
and
its
emotions
they
had
seemed
to
michael
as
dangerous
as
they
were
loathsome
collective
emotion
might
be
on
the
side
of
the
archangels
or
on
the
side
of
devils
and
of
swine
its
mass
was
what
made
it
dangerous
a
thing
that
challenged
the
resistance
of
the
private
soul
but
in
his
worst
dreams
of
what
it
could
do
to
him
michael
had
never
imagined
anything
more
appalling
than
the
collective
patriotism
of
the
british
and
their
allies
this
rushing
together
of
the
souls
of
four
countries
to
make
one
monstrous
soul
and
neither
anthony
nor
frances
realized
that
michael
at
this
moment
was
afraid
not
of
the
war
so
much
as
of
the
emotions
of
the
war
the
awful
terrifying
flood
that
carried
him
away
from
his
real
self
and
from
everything
it
cared
for
most
patriotism
was
no
doubt
a
fine
emotion
but
the
finer
the
thing
was
the
more
it
got
you
it
got
you
and
you
were
done
for
he
was
determined
that
it
should
get
him
they
could
see
and
that
was
michael
grievance
that
his
resistance
was
his
strength
and
not
his
weakness
even
frances
who
believed
that
people
never
changed
did
not
realize
that
the
michael
who
did
want
to
enlist
was
the
same
entity
as
the
little
michael
who
had
wanted
to
go
to
the
party
who
had
wanted
to
go
on
playing
with
himself
afraid
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
forgetting
pieces
of
himself
that
he
wanted
to
remember
he
was
michael
who
refused
to
stay
at
school
another
term
and
who
talked
about
shooting
himself
because
he
had
to
go
with
his
class
and
do
what
the
other
fellows
were
doing
he
objected
to
being
suddenly
required
to
feel
patriotic
because
other
people
were
feeling
patriotic
to
think
that
germany
was
in
the
wrong
because
other
people
thought
that
germany
was
in
the
wrong
to
fight
because
other
people
were
fighting
why
should
he
he
saw
no
earthly
reason
why
he
said
to
himself
that
it
was
the
blasted
cheek
of
the
assumption
that
he
resented
there
was
a
peculiarly
british
hypocrisy
and
unfairness
and
tyranny
about
it
all
it
was
as
they
all
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
afraid
to
fight
he
had
wanted
to
go
and
fight
for
ireland
he
would
fight
any
day
in
a
cleaner
cause
by
a
cleaner
cause
michael
meant
a
cause
that
had
not
been
messed
about
so
much
by
other
people
other
people
had
not
put
pressure
on
him
to
fight
for
ireland
in
fact
they
had
tried
to
stop
him
michael
was
also
aware
that
in
the
matter
of
ireland
his
emotions
though
shared
by
considerable
numbers
of
the
irish
people
were
not
shared
by
his
family
or
by
many
people
whom
he
knew
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
had
them
to
himself
it
was
no
use
trying
to
explain
all
this
to
his
father
and
mother
for
they
would
understand
it
the
more
he
explained
the
more
he
would
seem
to
them
to
be
a
shirker
he
could
see
what
they
thought
of
him
he
saw
it
in
their
stiff
reticent
faces
in
his
mother
strained
smile
in
his
sister
silence
when
he
asked
her
what
she
had
been
doing
all
day
their
eyes
his
mother
and
his
sister
eyes
pursued
him
with
the
unspoken
question
why
do
you
go
and
get
killed
for
england
like
other
people
still
he
could
bear
these
things
for
they
were
visible
palpable
he
knew
where
he
was
with
them
what
he
could
not
stand
was
that
empty
spiritual
space
between
him
and
nicky
that
hurt
him
where
he
was
most
vulnerable
in
his
imagination
and
again
his
imagination
healed
the
wound
it
made
it
was
all
very
well
but
if
you
happened
to
have
a
religion
and
your
religion
was
what
mattered
to
you
most
if
you
adored
beauty
as
the
supreme
form
of
life
if
you
cared
for
nothing
else
if
you
lived
impersonally
to
make
beauty
and
to
keep
it
alive
and
for
no
other
end
how
could
you
consent
to
take
part
in
this
bloody
business
that
would
be
the
last
betrayal
the
most
cowardly
surrender
and
you
were
all
the
more
bound
to
faithfulness
if
you
were
one
of
the
leaders
of
a
forlorn
hope
of
the
forlorn
hope
of
all
the
world
of
all
the
ages
the
forlorn
hope
of
god
himself
for
michael
even
more
than
ellis
had
given
himself
up
as
lost
and
yet
somehow
they
all
felt
curiously
braced
by
the
prospect
when
the
young
men
met
in
lawrence
stephen
house
they
discussed
it
with
a
calm
high
heroism
this
was
the
supreme
test
to
go
on
without
pay
without
praise
without
any
sort
of
recognition
any
fool
could
fight
but
if
you
were
an
artist
your
honour
bound
you
to
ignore
the
material
contest
to
refuse
even
to
your
country
the
surrender
of
the
highest
that
you
knew
they
believed
with
the
utmost
fervour
and
sincerity
that
they
defied
germany
more
effectually
because
more
spiritually
by
going
on
and
producing
fine
things
with
imperturbability
than
if
they
went
out
against
the
german
armies
with
bayonets
and
moreover
they
were
restoring
beauty
as
fast
as
germany
destroyed
it
they
told
each
other
these
things
very
seriously
and
earnestly
on
friday
evenings
as
they
lay
about
more
or
less
at
their
ease
but
rather
less
than
more
in
stephen
study
they
had
asked
each
other
are
going
to
fight
for
your
country
and
ellis
had
said
he
was
damned
if
he
fight
for
his
country
and
mitchell
had
said
he
had
got
a
country
so
there
was
no
point
in
his
fighting
anyhow
and
that
if
you
could
show
him
a
country
that
cared
for
the
arts
before
anything
he
fight
for
it
but
that
england
was
very
far
from
being
that
country
and
michael
had
sat
silent
thinking
the
same
thoughts
and
stephen
had
sat
silent
thinking
other
thoughts
not
listening
to
what
was
said
and
now
people
were
whining
about
louvain
and
rheims
cathedral
michael
said
to
himself
that
he
could
stand
these
massed
war
emotions
if
they
were
sincere
but
people
whined
about
louvain
and
rheims
cathedral
who
had
never
cared
a
damn
about
either
before
the
war
anthony
looked
up
over
the
edge
of
his
morning
paper
inquired
whether
michael
could
defend
the
destruction
of
louvain
and
rheims
cathedral
michael
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
bother
he
said
about
rheims
cathedral
and
louvain
from
your
point
of
view
it
all
right
if
louvain
and
rheims
cathedral
get
in
the
way
of
the
enemy
artillery
they
got
to
go
they
did
happen
to
be
in
the
way
of
ours
that
all
michael
mind
was
showing
certain
symptoms
significant
of
its
malady
he
was
inclined
to
disparage
the
military
achievements
of
the
allies
and
to
justify
the
acts
of
germany
it
up
to
the
french
to
defend
paris
and
what
have
we
got
to
do
with
as
if
every
inteligent
frenchman
did
know
that
is
a
sentimental
stunt
no
i
not
i
simply
see
things
as
they
are
i
think
frances
would
say
placably
we
better
not
talk
about
the
war
he
would
remind
them
that
it
was
not
his
subject
and
john
laughed
at
him
poor
old
nick
hates
the
war
because
dished
him
he
knows
his
poems
ca
come
out
till
it
over
as
it
happened
his
poems
came
out
that
autumn
after
all
the
germans
had
been
held
back
from
paris
as
stephen
pointed
out
to
him
the
battle
of
the
marne
had
saved
michael
in
magnificent
defiance
of
the
enemy
the
new
poems
of
michael
harrison
with
illustrations
by
austin
mitchell
were
announced
as
forthcoming
in
october
and
morton
ellis
eccentricities
with
illustrations
by
austin
mitchell
were
to
appear
the
same
month
even
wadham
poems
would
come
out
some
time
perhaps
next
spring
stephen
said
the
advertisements
should
be
offered
to
the
war
office
as
posters
to
strike
terror
into
germany
and
sustain
the
morale
of
the
allied
armies
if
england
could
afford
to
publish
michael
michael
family
made
no
comment
on
the
appearance
of
his
poems
the
book
lay
about
in
the
same
place
on
the
table
for
weeks
when
nanna
dusted
she
replaced
it
with
religious
care
none
of
his
people
had
so
much
as
taken
it
up
to
glance
inside
it
or
hold
it
in
their
hands
it
seemed
to
michael
that
they
were
conscious
of
it
all
the
time
and
that
they
turned
their
faces
away
from
it
pointedly
they
hated
it
they
hated
him
for
having
written
it
he
remembered
that
it
had
been
different
when
his
first
book
had
come
out
two
years
ago
they
had
read
that
they
had
snatched
at
all
the
reviews
of
it
and
read
it
again
trying
to
see
what
it
was
that
they
had
missed
they
had
taken
each
other
aside
and
it
had
been
anthony
do
you
understand
michael
poems
dorothy
do
you
understand
michael
poems
nicky
do
you
understand
michael
poems
he
remembered
his
mother
apology
for
not
understanding
them
darling
i
see
that
they
very
beautiful
he
remembered
how
he
had
wished
that
they
would
give
up
the
struggle
and
leave
his
poems
alone
they
were
not
written
for
them
he
had
been
amused
and
irritated
when
he
had
seen
his
father
holding
the
book
doggedly
in
front
of
him
his
poor
old
hands
twitching
with
embarrassment
whenever
he
thought
michael
was
looking
at
him
and
now
he
who
had
been
so
indifferent
and
so
contemptuous
was
sensitive
to
the
least
quiver
of
his
mother
upper
lip
veronica
were
the
only
eyes
that
were
kind
to
him
that
did
not
hunt
him
down
with
implacable
suggestion
and
reminder
veronica
had
been
rejected
too
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
nurse
in
the
hospitals
she
was
only
strong
enough
to
work
from
morning
to
night
packing
and
carrying
large
heavy
parcels
for
the
belgian
soldiers
she
wanted
michael
to
be
sorry
for
her
because
she
could
be
a
nurse
rosalind
jervis
was
a
nurse
but
he
was
not
sorry
he
said
he
would
very
much
rather
she
did
do
anything
that
rosalind
did
so
would
nicky
he
said
and
then
veronica
do
think
i
ought
to
enlist
the
thought
was
beginning
to
obsess
him
no
she
said
you
different
i
know
how
you
feel
about
it
nicky
heart
and
soul
are
in
the
war
if
he
killed
it
can
only
kill
his
body
soul
is
in
it
it
would
kill
your
soul
it
killing
it
now
killing
everything
i
care
for
killing
everything
we
all
care
for
except
the
things
it
ca
kill
that
was
one
sunday
evening
in
october
they
were
standing
together
on
the
long
terrace
under
the
house
wall
before
them
a
little
to
the
right
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
the
great
rose
over
the
garden
the
curved
and
dipping
branches
swayed
and
swung
in
a
low
wind
that
moved
like
quiet
water
michael
she
said
do
look
what
happening
to
that
tree
i
see
he
said
it
made
him
sad
to
look
at
the
tree
it
made
him
sad
to
look
at
veronica
because
both
the
tree
and
veronica
were
beautiful
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
to
sit
and
look
and
look
at
that
tree
till
it
changed
and
got
all
thin
and
queer
and
began
to
move
towards
me
i
never
knew
whether
it
had
really
happened
or
not
i
do
know
now
or
whether
it
was
the
tree
or
me
it
was
as
if
by
looking
and
looking
you
could
make
the
tree
more
real
and
more
alive
michael
remembered
something
dorothy
says
you
saw
ferdie
the
night
he
died
so
i
did
but
that
not
the
same
thing
i
did
have
to
look
and
look
i
just
saw
him
i
of
saw
frank
that
last
night
when
the
call
came
only
sort
of
but
i
knew
he
was
going
to
be
killed
i
did
see
him
nearly
so
distinctly
as
i
saw
nicky
you
did
see
him
as
you
saw
ferdie
no
no
no
it
was
ages
ago
in
germany
before
he
married
i
saw
him
with
desmond
have
you
ever
seen
me
not
yet
that
because
you
do
want
me
as
they
did
do
i
do
i
and
she
said
again
not
yet
nicky
had
had
leave
for
christmas
he
had
come
and
gone
frances
and
anthony
were
depressed
they
were
beginning
to
be
frightened
for
nicky
had
finished
his
training
he
might
be
sent
out
any
day
nicky
had
had
some
moments
of
depression
nothing
had
been
heard
of
the
moving
fortress
again
the
war
office
had
given
no
sign
of
having
received
it
it
was
hard
luck
he
said
on
drayton
and
john
was
depressed
after
he
had
gone
they
much
better
have
taken
me
he
said
what
the
good
of
sending
the
best
brains
in
the
army
to
get
pounded
there
drayton
he
ought
to
have
been
in
the
ordnance
he
killed
and
here
nicky
nicky
ought
to
be
in
the
engineers
or
the
gunners
or
the
royal
flying
corps
but
he
got
to
stand
in
the
trenches
and
be
pounded
lot
they
care
about
anybody
brains
drayton
could
have
told
kitchener
that
we
ca
win
this
war
without
shells
so
could
nicky
you
bet
they
stuck
all
those
plans
and
models
in
the
sanitary
behind
the
war
office
back
door
it
enough
to
make
nicky
blow
his
brains
out
nicky
does
care
really
veronica
said
he
just
leaves
things
and
goes
on
that
night
after
the
others
had
gone
to
bed
michael
stayed
behind
with
his
father
it
must
look
to
you
he
said
as
if
i
ought
to
have
gone
instead
of
nicky
i
do
say
so
michael
and
i
sure
nicky
would
no
but
you
both
think
it
you
see
if
i
went
i
should
be
any
good
at
it
not
the
same
good
as
nicky
he
wants
to
go
and
i
do
ca
you
see
it
different
yes
said
anthony
i
see
i
seen
it
for
some
time
and
michael
remembered
the
night
in
august
when
his
brother
came
to
him
in
his
room
beauty
the
forlorn
hope
of
god
if
he
cared
for
it
supremely
why
was
he
pursued
and
tormented
by
the
thought
of
the
space
between
him
and
nicky
xxii
michael
had
gone
to
stephen
house
he
was
no
longer
at
his
ease
there
it
seemed
to
him
that
eyes
followed
him
too
not
with
hatred
but
with
a
curious
meditative
wonder
stephen
said
to
him
did
you
know
that
réveillaud
killed
killed
killed
i
did
even
know
he
was
fighting
lawrence
laughed
what
did
you
suppose
he
was
doing
no
but
how
out
with
the
patrol
and
shot
down
there
you
are
he
shoved
the
to
him
pointing
to
the
extract
from
it
is
with
regret
that
we
record
the
death
of
jules
réveillaud
the
brilliant
young
poet
and
critic
michael
stared
at
the
first
three
lines
something
in
his
mind
prevented
him
from
going
on
to
the
rest
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
read
about
réveillaud
and
know
how
he
died
it
is
with
regret
that
we
record
the
death
it
is
with
regret
that
we
record
with
regret
then
he
read
on
slowly
and
carefully
to
the
end
it
was
a
long
paragraph
to
think
he
said
at
last
that
this
revolting
thing
should
have
happened
to
him
his
death
no
the
never
mentioned
réveillaud
before
none
of
the
big
papers
none
of
the
big
reviews
noticed
his
existence
except
to
sneer
at
him
he
goes
out
and
gets
killed
like
any
little
bourgeois
and
the
swine
plaster
him
all
over
with
their
filthy
praise
he
rather
they
spat
on
him
he
meditated
fiercely
well
he
could
help
it
he
was
conscripted
you
think
he
would
have
gone
of
his
own
accord
i
certain
he
would
and
i
certain
he
would
i
wish
to
god
we
got
conscription
here
i
rather
the
government
commandeered
my
body
than
stand
this
everlasting
interference
with
my
soul
then
said
lawrence
you
not
be
surprised
at
my
enlisting
you
not
i
am
i
have
been
in
the
first
week
if
i
known
what
to
do
about
vera
but
it
it
not
sane
perhaps
not
but
it
irish
irish
i
can
understand
ordinary
irishmen
rushing
into
a
european
row
for
the
row
sake
just
because
they
have
got
a
civil
war
to
mess
about
in
but
you
of
all
irishmen
why
on
earth
should
be
in
it
because
i
want
to
be
in
it
i
thought
said
michael
you
were
to
have
been
a
thorn
in
side
so
i
was
so
i
am
but
not
at
this
minute
my
grandmother
was
a
hard
ulster
woman
and
i
hated
her
but
i
would
be
a
thorn
in
my
grandmother
side
if
the
old
lady
was
assaulted
by
a
brutal
voluptuary
and
i
saw
her
down
and
fighting
for
her
honour
i
been
a
thorn
in
england
side
all
my
life
but
it
nothing
to
the
thorn
i
be
if
i
killed
fighting
for
her
why
why
if
you
want
to
fight
in
the
civil
war
afterwards
why
because
i
one
of
the
few
irishmen
who
can
reason
straight
i
was
going
into
the
civil
war
last
year
because
it
was
a
fight
for
freedom
i
going
into
this
war
this
year
because
it
a
bigger
fight
for
a
bigger
freedom
you
ca
have
a
free
ireland
without
a
free
england
any
more
than
you
can
have
religious
liberty
without
political
liberty
if
the
orangemen
understood
anything
at
all
about
it
they
see
it
was
the
nationalists
and
the
sinn
feiners
that
help
them
to
put
down
catholicism
in
ireland
you
think
it
matters
to
ireland
whether
germany
licks
us
or
we
lick
germany
i
think
it
matters
to
the
whole
world
what
changed
you
said
michael
he
was
angry
with
lawrence
he
thought
he
has
any
excuse
for
failing
us
he
has
been
conscripted
nothing
changed
me
but
supposing
it
did
matter
to
the
whole
world
or
even
to
europe
and
supposing
the
allies
were
beaten
in
the
end
you
and
i
should
be
beaten
once
we
stripped
ourselves
stripped
our
souls
clean
and
gone
in
victory
michael
victory
is
a
state
of
mind
the
opportunist
had
seen
his
supreme
opportunity
he
would
have
snatched
at
it
in
the
first
week
of
the
war
as
he
had
said
but
that
vera
had
made
it
hard
for
him
she
was
not
making
it
easy
now
the
dull
dark
moth
wings
of
her
eyes
hovered
about
him
fluttering
with
anxiety
when
she
heard
that
he
was
going
to
enlist
she
sent
for
veronica
veronica
said
you
must
let
him
go
i
ca
let
him
go
and
why
should
i
he
do
no
good
he
over
age
he
no
more
fit
than
i
am
you
have
to
sooner
or
later
later
then
not
one
minute
before
i
must
if
they
want
him
let
them
come
and
take
him
it
wo
hurt
so
much
if
you
let
him
go
gently
now
he
tear
at
you
if
you
keep
him
he
has
torn
at
me
he
tears
at
me
every
day
i
do
mind
his
tearing
i
mind
his
going
going
and
getting
killed
wounded
paralysed
broken
to
pieces
you
mind
his
hating
you
you
mind
that
awfully
i
sha
he
hated
me
before
he
went
away
and
left
me
once
but
he
came
back
he
ca
really
do
without
me
you
do
know
how
he
hate
you
if
you
come
between
him
and
what
he
wants
most
used
to
be
what
he
wanted
most
well
it
his
honour
now
that
what
they
all
say
michael
and
anthony
and
dorothy
they
men
and
they
do
know
dorothy
more
a
man
than
a
woman
but
you
different
i
thought
you
might
help
me
to
keep
him
they
say
you
got
some
tremendous
secret
and
this
is
the
way
you
go
on
i
would
help
you
to
keep
him
if
i
could
i
would
have
kept
nicky
for
all
the
world
aunt
frances
would
have
kept
him
she
wants
michael
to
go
she
does
if
she
says
she
does
she
lies
all
the
women
are
lying
either
they
do
care
they
just
with
no
hearts
and
no
nerves
in
them
or
they
lie
it
this
rotten
pose
of
patriotism
they
get
it
from
each
other
like
like
a
skin
disease
no
wonder
it
makes
michael
sick
men
going
out
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
to
be
cut
about
and
blown
to
bits
and
their
women
safe
at
home
snuffling
and
sentimentalizing
lying
lying
lying
who
would
who
would
tell
one
big
thumping
sacred
lie
if
it
sends
them
off
happy
but
we
not
lying
it
the
most
real
thing
that
ever
happened
to
us
i
glad
nicky
going
i
shall
be
glad
all
my
life
it
comes
easy
to
you
you
a
child
you
never
grown
up
you
were
a
miserable
little
mummy
when
you
were
born
and
now
you
look
as
if
every
drop
of
blood
was
drained
out
of
your
body
in
your
teens
if
your
tremendous
secret
you
can
keep
it
yourself
it
seems
to
be
all
you
got
if
it
was
for
aunt
frances
and
uncle
anthony
it
have
been
all
i
got
vera
looked
at
her
daughter
and
saw
her
for
the
first
time
as
she
really
was
the
child
was
not
a
child
any
more
she
was
a
woman
astonishingly
and
dangerously
mature
veronica
sorrowful
lucid
eyes
took
her
in
they
neither
weighed
her
nor
measured
her
but
judged
her
with
perfect
accuracy
poor
little
ronny
i
been
a
beastly
mother
to
you
still
you
can
thank
my
beastliness
for
aunt
frances
and
uncle
anthony
veronica
thought
how
funny
she
is
about
it
she
said
it
your
beastliness
to
poor
larry
that
i
mind
you
know
what
you
keeping
him
for
she
knew
and
lawrence
knew
that
night
he
told
her
that
if
he
had
wanted
to
enlist
he
be
driven
to
it
to
get
away
from
her
and
she
was
frightened
and
held
her
tongue
then
she
got
desperate
she
did
things
she
intrigued
behind
his
back
to
keep
him
and
he
found
her
out
he
came
to
her
furious
you
need
lie
about
it
he
said
i
know
what
you
done
been
writing
letters
and
getting
at
people
you
told
the
truth
about
my
age
and
you
lied
about
my
health
you
even
gone
round
cadging
for
jobs
for
me
in
the
red
cross
and
the
press
bureau
and
the
intelligence
department
and
god
only
knows
whether
i
supposed
to
have
put
you
up
to
it
i
took
care
of
that
larry
you
you
no
right
to
interfere
with
my
affairs
had
i
not
after
living
with
you
seven
years
if
you
lived
with
me
seven
centuries
you
have
had
no
right
to
try
to
keep
a
man
back
from
the
army
i
trying
to
keep
a
man
brain
for
my
country
you
lie
it
my
body
you
trying
to
keep
for
yourself
as
you
did
when
i
was
going
to
ireland
oh
then
i
tried
to
stop
you
from
being
a
traitor
to
england
have
hanged
you
my
dear
for
that
traitor
it
women
like
you
that
are
the
traitors
my
god
if
there
was
a
government
in
this
country
that
could
govern
you
be
strung
up
in
a
row
all
of
you
and
hanged
no
wonder
you
think
you
cut
out
for
a
soldier
you
cruel
enough
cruel
i
rather
be
hanged
than
live
with
you
a
day
longer
after
what
you
done
a
frenchman
shot
his
the
other
day
for
less
than
that
what
was
than
that
she
said
she
crawled
after
him
to
the
camp
like
a
bitch
he
sent
her
away
and
she
came
again
and
again
he
to
shoot
her
was
there
nothing
to
be
said
for
her
there
was
she
knew
it
was
a
big
risk
and
she
took
it
knew
you
were
safe
while
you
slimed
my
honour
she
loved
him
and
he
shot
her
and
you
think
that
a
fine
thing
she
must
have
loved
him
men
do
want
to
be
loved
that
way
that
the
mistake
you
women
will
make
it
the
way
you
taught
us
i
should
like
to
know
what
other
way
you
ever
want
us
to
love
you
the
way
veronica
loves
nicky
and
dorothy
loved
drayton
and
frances
loves
anthony
dorothy
she
ruined
drayton
life
men
lives
are
ruined
that
way
and
not
all
women
well
anyhow
if
she
loved
him
she
have
married
him
and
frances
loves
her
children
better
than
anthony
and
anthony
knows
it
veronica
then
veronica
does
know
what
passion
is
the
poor
child
anæmic
another
mistake
veronica
and
like
veronica
have
more
passion
in
one
eyelash
than
you
have
in
your
whole
body
it
a
pity
she
said
you
ca
have
veronica
and
her
eyelashes
instead
of
me
she
young
and
she
pretty
he
sighed
with
pain
as
her
nerves
lashed
into
his
that
what
it
all
amounts
to
your
wanting
to
get
out
to
the
front
it
what
the
matter
with
half
the
men
who
go
there
and
pose
as
heroes
they
want
to
get
rid
of
the
wives
and
mistresses
they
tired
of
because
the
poor
things
are
young
or
pretty
any
longer
she
dropped
into
the
mourning
voice
that
made
him
mad
with
her
old
old
old
and
the
war
making
me
older
every
day
and
uglier
and
i
not
married
to
you
talk
of
keeping
you
how
i
keep
you
when
i
old
and
ugly
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
with
a
hard
pity
compunction
always
worked
in
him
at
the
sight
of
her
haggard
face
glazed
and
stained
with
crying
that
how
by
getting
older
i
never
tired
of
you
you
more
to
me
now
than
you
were
when
i
first
knew
you
it
when
i
see
you
looking
old
that
i
sure
i
love
you
she
smiled
too
in
her
sad
sexual
wisdom
there
may
be
women
who
believe
you
larry
or
who
say
they
believe
you
but
not
me
it
the
truth
he
said
if
you
were
young
and
if
you
were
married
to
me
i
should
have
enlisted
months
ago
ca
you
see
it
not
you
it
this
life
we
lead
that
i
sick
and
tired
of
i
tell
you
i
rather
be
hanged
than
go
on
with
it
i
rather
be
a
prisoner
in
germany
than
shut
up
in
this
house
of
yours
poor
little
house
you
used
to
like
it
what
wrong
with
it
now
everything
those
damned
all
round
it
and
that
damned
white
wall
round
the
shutting
me
in
and
those
curtains
in
your
shutting
me
in
and
your
mind
trying
to
shut
mine
in
i
come
into
this
room
and
i
find
phyllis
desmond
in
it
and
drinking
tea
and
talking
i
go
upstairs
for
peace
and
michael
and
ellis
are
sitting
there
talking
trying
to
persuade
themselves
that
the
divinest
thing
in
god
universe
and
over
there
the
one
thing
i
been
looking
for
all
my
life
the
one
thing
i
cared
for
and
you
keeping
me
from
it
they
left
it
but
it
began
all
over
again
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
lawrence
went
on
growing
his
moustache
and
trying
to
train
it
upwards
in
the
way
she
hated
one
evening
towards
he
turned
up
in
khaki
the
moustache
stiff
on
his
long
upper
lip
his
lopping
hair
clipped
he
was
another
man
a
strange
man
and
she
was
not
sure
whether
she
hated
him
or
not
but
she
dried
her
eyes
and
dressed
her
hair
and
put
on
her
best
gown
to
do
honour
to
his
khaki
she
said
it
be
like
living
with
another
man
you
wo
have
very
long
to
live
with
him
said
lawrence
and
even
then
sombrely
under
the
shadow
of
his
destiny
her
passion
for
him
revived
his
very
strangeness
quickened
it
to
violence
to
perversity
and
in
the
morning
the
army
took
him
from
her
it
held
him
out
of
her
reach
he
refused
to
let
her
go
with
him
to
the
place
where
he
was
stationed
what
would
you
do
she
said
if
i
followed
you
shoot
me
i
might
shoot
anyhow
you
never
see
me
or
hear
from
me
again
he
went
out
to
france
three
weeks
before
nicholas
she
had
worn
herself
out
with
wondering
when
he
would
be
sent
till
she
too
was
in
a
hurry
for
him
to
go
and
end
it
now
that
he
had
gone
she
felt
nothing
but
a
clean
and
sane
relief
that
was
a
sort
of
peace
she
told
herself
that
she
would
rather
he
were
killed
soon
than
that
she
should
be
tortured
any
longer
with
suspense
if
i
saw
his
name
in
the
lists
this
morning
i
should
mind
that
would
end
it
and
she
sent
her
servant
to
the
stationer
to
stop
the
papers
for
fear
lest
she
should
see
his
name
in
the
lists
but
lawrence
spared
her
he
was
wounded
in
his
first
engagement
and
died
of
his
wounds
in
a
hospital
at
dunkirk
the
red
cross
woman
who
nursed
him
wrote
to
vera
an
hour
before
he
died
she
gave
details
and
a
message
i
writing
now
from
his
dictation
he
says
you
to
forgive
him
and
not
to
be
too
sorry
because
it
was
what
he
thought
it
would
be
he
means
the
fighting
only
much
more
so
all
except
this
last
bit
he
wants
you
to
tell
michael
and
dicky
nicky
that
he
says
odd
i
should
be
first
when
he
got
the
start
of
me
i
think
he
means
you
to
forgive
him
for
leaving
you
to
go
to
the
war
it
is
all
over
he
was
too
weak
to
say
anything
more
but
he
sent
you
his
love
vera
said
to
herself
he
did
she
made
that
up
she
hated
the
red
cross
woman
who
had
been
with
lawrence
and
had
seen
so
much
who
had
dared
to
tell
her
what
he
meant
and
to
make
up
messages
xxiii
nicholas
had
applied
for
a
commission
and
he
had
got
it
and
frances
was
glad
she
had
been
proud
of
him
because
he
had
chosen
the
ranks
instead
of
the
officers
training
corps
but
she
persisted
in
the
belief
that
when
it
came
to
the
trenches
second
lieutenants
stood
a
better
chance
for
goodness
sake
nicholas
had
said
do
tell
her
that
they
over
the
parapet
first
that
was
in
december
in
february
he
got
a
week
leave
sudden
unforeseen
and
special
leave
it
had
to
be
broken
to
her
this
time
that
leave
as
special
as
that
meant
she
said
well
if
it
does
i
shall
have
him
for
six
whole
days
she
had
learned
how
to
handle
time
how
to
prolong
the
present
drawing
it
out
minute
by
minute
thus
her
happiness
stretched
to
the
snapping
point
vibrated
she
had
a
sense
of
its
vibration
now
as
she
looked
at
nicholas
it
was
the
evening
of
the
day
he
had
come
home
and
they
were
all
in
the
together
he
was
standing
before
her
straight
and
tall
on
the
hearthrug
where
he
had
lifted
the
persian
cat
timmy
out
of
his
sleep
and
was
holding
him
against
his
breast
timmy
spread
himself
there
softly
and
heavily
hanging
on
to
nicky
shoulder
by
his
claws
he
butted
nicky
chin
with
his
head
purring
i
do
know
how
i
to
tear
myself
away
from
timmy
i
should
like
to
wear
him
alive
as
a
waistcoat
or
hanging
on
my
shoulder
like
a
cape
with
his
tail
curled
tight
round
my
neck
he
look
uncommonly
with
all
his
khaki
patches
why
do
you
take
him
with
you
anthony
said
he
ronny
cat
he
is
i
given
him
to
you
veronica
said
when
now
this
minute
to
sleep
on
your
feet
and
keep
you
warm
frances
listened
and
thought
what
children
what
babies
they
are
after
all
if
only
this
minute
could
be
stretched
out
farther
i
must
nicky
said
i
should
spend
hours
in
dalliance
and
if
a
shell
got
him
it
would
ruin
my
morale
timmy
unhooked
from
nicky
shoulder
lay
limp
in
his
arms
he
lay
on
his
back
in
ecstasy
his
legs
apart
showing
the
soft
fur
of
his
stomach
nicky
rubbed
his
face
against
the
soft
fur
i
say
what
a
heavenly
death
it
would
be
to
die
smothered
in
timmies
nicky
you
a
beastly
sensualist
that
what
the
matter
with
you
john
said
and
they
all
laughed
the
minute
broke
stretched
to
its
furthest
frances
was
making
plans
now
for
nicky
week
there
were
things
they
could
do
plays
they
could
see
places
they
could
go
to
anthony
would
let
them
have
the
big
car
as
much
as
they
wanted
for
you
could
stretch
time
out
by
filling
it
you
could
multiply
the
hours
by
what
they
held
ronny
and
i
are
going
to
get
married
nicky
said
we
settled
it
that
we
would
at
once
if
i
got
it
the
best
thing
to
do
of
course
frances
said
it
the
best
thing
to
do
but
she
had
not
allowed
for
it
nor
for
the
pain
it
gave
her
that
pain
shocked
her
it
was
awful
to
think
that
after
all
her
surrenders
nicky
happiness
could
give
her
pain
it
meant
that
she
had
never
let
go
her
secret
hold
she
had
been
a
hypocrite
to
herself
nicky
was
talking
on
about
it
excitedly
as
he
used
to
talk
on
about
his
pleasures
when
he
was
a
child
if
dad
let
us
have
the
racing
car
we
go
down
to
morfe
we
can
do
it
in
a
day
my
dear
boy
anthony
said
do
you
know
i
lent
the
house
to
the
red
cross
and
let
the
shooting
i
do
care
there
the
little
house
in
the
village
we
can
have
and
harker
and
his
wife
can
look
after
us
harker
gone
to
the
war
and
his
wife
looking
after
his
children
somewhere
and
i
put
two
belgian
refugees
into
it
can
look
after
us
said
nicky
we
stay
three
days
run
back
and
have
one
day
at
home
before
i
sail
frances
gave
up
her
play
with
time
she
was
beaten
and
still
she
thought
at
least
i
shall
have
him
one
whole
day
and
then
she
looked
across
the
room
to
michael
as
if
michael
face
had
signalled
to
her
his
clear
skin
showed
blotches
of
white
where
the
blood
had
left
it
a
light
sweat
was
on
his
forehead
when
their
eyes
met
he
shifted
his
position
to
give
himself
an
appearance
of
ease
michael
had
not
reckoned
on
his
brother
marriage
either
it
was
when
he
asked
himself
on
what
then
he
been
reckoning
that
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
he
had
not
reckoned
on
anything
but
the
sudden
realization
of
what
he
might
have
reckoned
on
made
him
sick
he
could
bear
to
think
of
ronny
married
and
yet
again
he
could
bear
to
think
of
nicky
not
marrying
her
if
he
had
had
a
hold
on
her
he
would
have
let
her
go
in
this
he
knew
himself
to
be
sincere
he
had
had
no
hold
on
her
and
to
talk
about
letting
her
go
was
idiotic
still
there
was
a
violent
pursuit
and
possession
by
the
mind
and
michael
mind
was
innocent
of
jealousy
that
psychic
assault
and
outrage
on
the
woman
he
loved
his
spiritual
surrender
of
her
was
so
perfect
that
his
very
imagination
gave
her
up
to
nicky
he
was
glad
that
they
were
going
to
be
married
tomorrow
nothing
could
take
their
three
days
from
them
even
when
the
war
had
done
its
worst
and
then
with
his
mother
eyes
on
him
he
thought
does
she
think
i
was
reckoning
on
that
nicholas
and
veronica
were
married
the
next
morning
at
hampstead
town
hall
before
the
registrar
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
anthony
racing
car
defying
and
circumventing
time
and
space
and
the
police
tearing
nicky
said
whole
handfuls
out
of
eternity
by
sheer
speed
at
intervals
with
a
clear
run
before
him
he
let
out
the
racing
car
to
its
top
speed
on
the
great
north
road
it
snorted
and
purred
and
throbbed
like
some
immense
nervous
animal
but
lightly
and
purely
as
if
all
its
weight
were
purged
from
it
by
speed
it
flew
up
and
down
the
hills
of
hertfordshire
and
buckinghamshire
and
out
on
to
the
flat
country
round
peterborough
and
grantham
a
country
of
silver
green
and
emerald
green
grass
and
purple
fallow
land
and
bright
red
houses
and
so
on
to
the
great
plain
of
york
and
past
reyburn
up
towards
the
bare
hill
country
netted
with
grey
stone
walls
nicholas
slowed
the
car
down
for
the
winding
of
the
road
it
went
now
between
long
straight
ramparts
of
hills
that
showed
enormous
and
dark
against
a
sky
cleared
to
twilight
by
the
unrisen
moon
other
hills
darker
still
and
more
enormous
stood
piled
up
in
front
of
them
blocking
the
head
of
rathdale
then
the
road
went
straight
and
nicholas
was
reckless
it
was
as
if
ultimately
they
must
charge
into
the
centre
of
that
incredibly
high
immense
obstruction
they
were
thrilled
mysteriously
as
before
the
image
of
monstrous
and
omnipotent
disaster
then
the
dale
widened
it
made
way
for
them
and
saved
them
the
lights
of
morfe
on
its
high
platform
made
the
pattern
of
a
coronet
and
pendants
on
the
darkness
the
small
scattered
lights
of
the
village
below
the
village
they
were
making
for
showed
as
if
dropped
out
of
the
pattern
on
the
hill
one
larger
light
burned
in
the
room
that
was
their
marriage
chamber
jean
and
suzanne
the
refugees
stood
in
the
white
porch
to
receive
them
holding
the
lanterns
that
were
their
marriage
torches
the
old
woman
held
her
light
low
down
lighting
the
flagstone
of
the
threshold
the
old
man
lifted
his
high
showing
the
lintel
of
the
door
it
was
so
low
that
nicholas
had
to
stoop
to
go
in
in
the
morning
they
read
the
date
cut
in
the
wall
above
the
porch
the
house
was
old
and
bent
and
grey
its
windows
were
narrow
slits
in
the
stone
mullions
it
crouched
under
the
dipping
boughs
of
the
that
sheltered
it
inside
there
was
just
room
for
veronica
to
stand
up
nicholas
had
to
stoop
or
knock
his
head
against
the
beams
it
had
only
four
rooms
two
for
nicholas
and
veronica
and
two
for
jean
and
suzanne
and
it
was
rather
dark
but
it
pleased
them
they
said
it
was
their
grown
up
because
they
were
grown
up
and
keeping
strict
proportions
you
had
to
crawl
into
it
and
you
were
only
really
comfortable
sitting
or
lying
down
so
they
sat
outside
it
watching
old
suzanne
through
the
window
as
she
moved
about
the
house
place
cooking
belgian
food
for
them
and
old
jean
as
he
worked
in
the
garden
veronica
loved
jean
and
suzanne
she
had
found
out
all
about
them
the
first
morning
only
think
nicky
they
from
termonde
and
their
house
was
burnt
behind
them
as
they
left
it
they
saw
horrors
and
their
son
was
killed
in
the
war
yet
they
happy
and
at
peace
almost
as
if
they
forgotten
plant
flowers
in
his
garden
they
old
ronny
and
perhaps
they
were
tired
already
when
it
happened
yes
that
must
be
it
they
old
and
tired
and
now
it
was
the
last
adventure
of
their
last
day
they
were
walking
on
the
slope
of
renton
moor
that
looks
over
rathdale
towards
greffington
edge
the
light
from
the
west
poured
itself
in
vivid
green
down
the
valley
below
them
broke
itself
into
purple
on
karva
hill
to
the
north
above
morfe
and
was
beaten
back
in
subtle
blue
and
violet
from
the
stone
rampart
of
the
edge
nicholas
had
been
developing
in
fancy
the
strategic
resources
of
the
country
guns
on
renton
moor
guns
along
greffington
edge
on
sarrack
moor
the
raking
lines
of
the
hills
were
straight
as
if
they
had
been
measured
with
a
ruler
and
then
planed
ronny
he
said
at
last
we
licked
in
the
first
round
you
and
i
the
beastly
boche
ca
do
us
out
of
these
three
days
no
we
been
absolutely
happy
and
we
never
forget
it
never
perhaps
it
was
a
bit
rough
on
dad
and
mummy
our
carting
ourselves
up
here
away
from
them
but
you
see
they
do
really
mind
feeling
about
it
now
just
as
we
feel
about
it
i
knew
they
would
there
had
been
a
letter
from
frances
saying
she
was
glad
they
gone
she
was
so
happy
thinking
how
happy
they
were
they
angels
nicky
are
they
simply
angels
that
the
rotten
part
of
it
i
wish
i
wish
i
could
tell
them
what
i
think
of
them
but
you
ca
somehow
it
sticks
in
your
throat
that
sort
of
thing
you
need
she
said
they
know
all
right
she
thought
this
is
what
he
wants
me
to
tell
them
about
afterwards
yes
but
i
must
have
hurt
them
hurt
them
horribly
lots
of
times
i
wish
i
had
but
he
went
on
they
funny
you
know
dad
actually
thought
it
idiotic
of
us
to
do
this
he
said
it
would
only
make
it
harder
for
us
when
i
had
to
go
they
do
see
that
it
just
piling
it
on
going
from
one
jolly
adventure
to
another
i
afraid
though
what
he
really
meant
was
it
was
hard
on
you
because
the
rest
of
it
all
my
show
but
it
is
all
your
show
nicky
darling
it
mine
and
theirs
because
we
have
grudged
you
your
adventure
that
exactly
how
i
want
you
to
feel
about
it
and
they
assuming
that
i
sha
come
back
which
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
is
pretty
big
cheek
they
talk
and
they
think
as
though
nobody
ever
got
through
whereas
i
every
intention
of
getting
through
and
of
coming
back
i
the
sort
of
chap
who
does
get
through
who
does
come
back
and
even
if
i
was
if
they
studied
statistics
they
see
that
it
a
thousand
chances
to
one
against
the
boches
getting
me
just
me
out
of
all
the
other
chaps
as
if
i
was
so
jolly
important
no
do
interrupt
let
get
this
thing
straight
while
we
can
supposing
just
supposing
i
did
get
through
did
come
back
supposing
i
was
unlike
myself
and
got
killed
i
want
you
to
think
of
not
as
a
clumsy
accident
but
just
another
awfully
interesting
thing
i
done
because
you
see
you
might
be
going
to
have
a
baby
and
if
you
took
the
thing
as
a
shock
instead
of
of
what
it
probably
really
is
and
went
and
got
cut
up
about
it
you
might
start
the
little
beggar
with
a
sort
of
fit
and
shake
its
little
nerves
up
so
that
it
would
be
jumpy
all
its
life
it
ought
said
nicky
to
sit
in
its
little
house
all
quiet
and
comfy
till
it
time
for
it
to
come
out
he
was
struck
with
a
sudden
poignant
realization
of
what
might
be
what
probably
would
be
what
ought
to
be
what
he
had
wanted
more
than
anything
next
to
veronica
it
shall
nicky
it
shall
be
quiet
and
comfy
if
came
off
all
right
he
said
it
would
make
it
up
to
mother
no
end
it
would
make
it
up
to
me
you
do
know
what
it
would
do
he
said
she
thought
i
do
want
it
i
do
want
anything
but
you
that
why
he
went
on
i
giving
don
as
the
next
of
kin
the
one
they
wire
to
because
it
wo
take
him
that
way
it
only
make
him
madder
to
get
out
and
do
for
them
i
afraid
of
you
or
mummy
or
dad
or
michael
being
told
first
it
does
matter
a
bit
who
first
i
shall
first
she
said
and
you
need
be
afraid
it
wo
kill
either
me
or
the
baby
if
a
shock
could
kill
me
i
should
have
died
long
ago
when
when
you
went
to
desmond
then
when
i
thought
i
could
bear
it
any
longer
something
happened
what
i
do
know
i
do
know
what
it
now
i
only
know
what
it
does
it
always
happens
always
when
you
want
it
awfully
and
when
quiet
and
give
yourself
up
to
it
it
happen
again
he
listened
frowning
a
little
not
quite
at
ease
not
quite
interested
puzzled
as
if
he
had
lost
her
trail
put
off
as
if
something
had
come
between
him
and
her
you
can
make
it
happen
to
other
people
she
was
saying
so
that
when
things
get
too
awful
they
can
bear
them
i
wanted
it
to
happen
to
dorothy
when
she
was
in
prison
and
it
did
she
said
she
was
absolutely
happy
there
and
that
all
sorts
of
queer
things
came
to
her
and
nicky
they
were
the
same
queer
things
that
came
to
me
it
was
like
something
getting
through
to
her
i
say
did
you
ever
do
it
to
me
only
once
when
you
wanted
it
awfully
when
when
now
he
was
interested
he
was
intrigued
he
was
on
her
trail
when
desmond
did
that
awful
thing
i
wanted
you
to
see
that
it
matter
it
was
the
end
but
that
just
what
i
did
see
what
i
kept
on
telling
myself
it
looks
as
if
it
worked
then
it
does
always
it
comes
and
goes
but
i
think
with
it
would
always
come
because
you
more
than
other
people
i
mean
i
care
more
for
you
she
closed
and
clinched
it
that
why
you
not
to
bother
about
me
nicky
if
most
awful
thing
happened
and
you
did
come
back
it
would
come
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
he
said
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
it
so
real
that
i
think
it
god
that
why
so
magnificently
brave
dorothy
and
aunt
frances
and
all
of
them
they
do
believe
in
it
they
do
know
it
there
even
michael
does
know
it
there
yet
and
still
they
go
on
bearing
and
bearing
and
they
were
glad
to
give
you
up
i
know
he
said
lots
of
people
they
glad
but
they
really
glad
he
meditated
there
one
thing
i
ca
think
what
you
do
unless
it
praying
or
something
and
if
you
going
to
turn
it
on
to
me
ronny
i
wish
be
careful
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
anything
in
it
at
all
there
might
be
hitches
i
mean
to
say
you
might
work
it
just
enough
to
keep
me
from
being
killed
but
not
enough
to
keep
my
legs
from
being
blown
off
or
the
boches
might
get
me
fair
enough
and
you
might
bring
me
back
all
paralysed
and
idiotic
that
what
i
should
funk
i
should
funk
it
most
damnably
if
i
thought
about
it
luckily
one
does
think
but
nicky
i
should
try
to
keep
you
back
then
any
more
than
i
tried
before
you
would
honour
bright
of
course
i
would
it
would
be
playing
the
game
to
begin
with
i
wo
believe
that
you
not
going
to
get
through
but
if
you
did
if
you
did
come
back
i
still
would
believe
you
gone
i
should
say
has
cared
he
gone
on
to
something
else
it
does
end
him
he
was
silent
the
long
rampart
of
the
hill
as
he
stared
at
it
made
a
pattern
on
his
mind
a
pattern
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
veronica
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
do
you
mind
talking
about
it
she
said
me
rather
not
it
sort
of
interests
me
i
do
know
whether
i
believe
in
your
thing
or
not
but
i
always
had
that
feeling
that
you
go
on
you
do
stop
you
ca
stop
that
why
i
do
care
they
used
to
think
i
was
trying
to
be
funny
when
i
said
i
did
care
but
i
really
did
things
most
things
do
much
matter
because
there
always
something
else
you
go
on
to
it
i
care
for
matter
most
awfully
and
my
people
but
most
of
all
you
you
always
have
mattered
to
me
more
than
anything
since
the
first
time
i
heard
you
calling
out
to
me
to
come
and
sit
on
your
bed
because
you
were
frightened
you
always
will
matter
but
desmond
did
a
little
bit
you
have
tried
to
make
me
she
did
she
really
did
i
only
married
her
because
she
was
going
to
have
a
baby
and
was
because
i
remembered
you
and
the
rotten
time
you
had
i
believe
that
would
have
kept
me
straight
with
women
if
nothing
else
did
of
course
i
was
an
idiot
about
it
i
did
think
of
marrying
you
till
vera
told
me
i
ought
to
have
waited
then
it
was
too
late
that
why
i
want
you
most
awfully
to
have
a
baby
yes
nicky
i
tell
you
what
i
going
to
do
when
i
know
it
coming
the
cottage
belongs
to
uncle
anthony
does
it
yes
well
i
love
it
do
you
think
he
let
me
live
in
it
i
think
he
give
it
to
you
if
you
asked
him
for
my
very
own
like
the
house
very
well
he
give
it
to
me
i
mean
to
both
of
us
and
i
shall
come
up
here
where
it
all
quiet
and
you
never
know
there
was
a
war
at
all
even
the
belgians
have
forgotten
it
and
i
shall
sit
out
here
and
look
at
that
hill
because
it
straight
and
beautiful
i
wo
i
simply
wo
think
of
anything
that
is
straight
and
beautiful
and
i
shall
get
strong
then
the
baby
will
be
straight
and
beautiful
and
strong
too
i
shall
try
i
shall
try
hard
nicky
to
make
him
like
you
frances
one
day
was
not
a
success
it
was
taken
up
with
little
things
that
had
to
be
done
for
nicky
always
they
seemed
he
and
she
to
be
on
the
edge
of
something
great
something
satisfying
and
revealing
it
was
to
come
in
a
look
or
a
word
and
both
would
remember
it
afterwards
for
ever
in
the
evening
grannie
and
auntie
louie
and
auntie
emmeline
and
auntie
edie
and
uncle
morrie
and
uncle
bartie
came
up
to
say
and
in
the
morning
nicholas
went
off
to
france
excited
and
happy
as
he
had
gone
off
on
his
wedding
journey
and
between
frances
and
her
son
the
great
thing
remained
unsaid
time
itself
was
broken
all
her
minutes
were
scattered
like
fine
sand
france
dearest
mother
and
dad
i
simply
do
know
how
to
thank
you
all
for
the
fur
coat
it
pronounced
the
rippingest
by
a
long
way
that
been
seen
in
these
trenches
did
ronny
really
choose
it
because
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
out
of
timmy
tummy
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
timmy
timmy
on
his
hind
legs
rampant
clawing
at
the
boches
just
think
of
the
effect
if
he
got
up
over
the
parapet
the
other
things
came
all
right
too
thanks
when
you
ca
think
what
else
to
send
let
nanna
make
another
cake
and
those
tubes
of
chutney
are
a
good
idea
no
it
no
earthly
use
worrying
about
michael
if
there
was
no
english
and
no
allies
and
no
enthusiasm
and
he
had
this
war
all
to
himself
you
simply
could
keep
him
out
of
it
i
believe
if
old
mick
could
send
himself
out
by
himself
against
the
whole
german
army
he
manage
to
put
in
some
first
rate
fancy
work
in
the
second
or
two
before
they
got
him
he
be
quite
capable
of
going
off
and
doing
grisly
things
that
would
make
me
faint
with
funk
if
he
was
by
himself
with
nothing
but
the
eye
of
god
to
look
at
him
and
he
rather
god
was
there
he
always
afraid
of
having
a
crowd
with
him
the
pity
is
he
wasting
time
and
missing
such
a
lot
if
i
were
you
two
i
should
bank
on
don
he
the
sensiblest
of
us
though
he
is
the
youngest
and
do
worry
about
me
do
remember
that
even
in
the
thickest
curtain
fire
there
holes
there
are
more
holes
than
there
is
stuff
and
the
chances
are
i
shall
be
where
a
hole
is
another
thing
don
shell
the
shell
you
see
making
straight
for
you
like
an
express
train
is
likely
to
be
the
shell
that
going
to
get
you
so
that
if
you
hit
you
do
feel
that
pang
of
personal
resentment
which
must
be
the
worst
part
of
the
business
bits
of
shells
that
have
exploded
i
rank
with
bullets
which
we
knew
all
about
before
and
were
prepared
for
really
if
you
planted
out
in
the
open
the
peculiar
awfulness
of
big
what
is
it
more
than
the
peculiar
awfulness
of
being
run
over
by
express
trains
let
loose
about
the
sky
tell
don
that
when
shrapnel
empties
itself
over
your
head
like
an
old
tin
pail
you
might
feel
injured
but
the
big
shell
has
a
most
disarming
air
of
not
being
able
to
help
itself
of
not
looking
for
anybody
in
particular
it
so
innocent
of
personal
malice
that
i
rather
have
it
any
day
than
fat
german
fingers
squeezing
my
windpipe
that
an
answer
to
his
question
and
dorothy
wanted
to
know
what
it
feels
like
going
into
action
well
there
a
lot
of
it
that
perhaps
she
would
believe
in
if
i
told
her
it
the
sort
of
thing
she
never
has
believed
but
stephen
was
absolutely
right
you
are
sold
it
more
than
anything
you
could
have
imagined
i
not
speaking
only
for
myself
there
just
one
beastly
sensation
when
you
half
way
between
your
parapet
and
theirs
other
fellows
say
they
felt
it
too
when
afraid
it
the
feeling
should
fizzle
out
before
you
get
there
but
it
does
it
grows
more
and
more
so
simply
swinging
you
on
to
them
and
that
swing
makes
up
for
all
the
rotten
times
put
together
you
be
sorry
for
us
it
waste
of
pity
i
know
don
and
dorothy
and
dad
and
ronny
are
sorry
for
us
but
not
so
sure
of
michael
and
always
your
loving
nicky
may
france
my
dear
mick
it
awfully
decent
of
you
to
write
so
often
when
you
loathe
writing
especially
about
things
that
bore
you
but
you
do
that
we
get
the
news
from
the
other
fronts
in
the
papers
more
or
less
and
i
honestly
do
care
a
damn
what
asquith
is
saying
or
what
lloyd
george
is
doing
or
what
northcliffe
motives
are
personally
i
should
say
he
was
simply
trying
like
most
of
us
to
save
his
country
looks
like
it
but
you
can
tell
him
from
me
if
he
gets
them
to
send
us
enough
shells
out
we
sha
worry
about
his
motives
anyhow
that
sort
of
thing
is
in
your
line
old
man
and
dad
can
do
it
much
better
than
you
if
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
don
and
dorothy
are
doing
and
the
last
sweet
thing
dad
said
to
mother
i
give
a
day
rest
in
my
billet
for
one
of
his
jokes
and
i
like
to
hear
about
morrie
going
on
the
bust
again
too
it
sounds
so
peaceful
only
if
it
really
is
anxiety
about
me
that
makes
him
do
it
i
wish
he
leave
off
thinking
about
me
poor
old
thing
more
than
anything
i
want
to
know
how
ronny
is
how
she
looking
and
what
she
feeling
you
be
able
to
make
out
a
lot
and
she
may
tell
you
things
she
wo
tell
the
others
that
why
i
glad
you
there
and
not
here
and
as
for
that
why
go
on
worrying
i
do
know
how
you
feel
about
it
i
think
i
always
did
in
a
way
i
never
thought
you
were
a
putrid
pacifist
your
mind
all
right
you
say
the
war
takes
me
like
religion
perhaps
it
does
i
do
know
enough
about
religion
to
say
but
it
seems
near
enough
for
a
first
shot
and
when
you
say
it
take
you
that
way
that
you
have
got
it
i
can
see
that
that
expresses
a
fairly
understandable
state
of
mind
of
course
i
know
it
is
funk
if
you
happened
to
think
of
the
ultimatum
first
instead
of
the
government
you
have
been
in
at
the
start
before
me
well
there
such
a
thing
as
conversion
is
there
you
never
can
tell
what
may
happen
to
you
and
the
war
is
over
yet
those
of
us
who
are
in
it
now
are
going
to
see
the
best
of
it
by
a
long
way
no
doubt
the
very
finest
fighting
be
at
the
finish
so
that
the
patriotic
beggars
who
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
join
up
will
be
jolly
well
sold
poor
devils
take
me
for
instance
if
i
got
what
i
wanted
and
been
out
in
flanders
in
ten
to
one
i
should
have
been
in
the
retreat
from
mons
like
frank
and
never
anywhere
else
then
i
have
given
my
head
to
have
gone
to
gallipoli
but
well
i
just
as
glad
i
not
mixed
up
in
that
affair
still
that
not
the
way
to
look
at
it
calculating
the
fun
you
can
get
out
of
it
for
yourself
and
it
certainly
not
the
way
to
win
the
war
at
that
rate
one
might
go
on
saving
oneself
up
for
the
rhine
while
all
the
other
fellows
were
getting
pounded
to
a
splash
on
the
way
there
so
if
you
going
to
be
converted
let
hope
you
be
converted
quick
if
you
are
my
advice
is
try
to
get
your
commission
straight
away
there
are
things
you
wo
be
able
to
stand
if
you
a
tommy
for
instance
having
to
pig
it
on
the
floor
with
all
your
brother
tommies
i
slept
for
three
months
next
to
a
beastly
blighter
who
used
to
come
in
drunk
and
tread
on
my
face
and
be
ill
all
over
me
even
now
when
i
look
back
on
it
that
seems
worse
than
anything
happened
out
here
but
that
because
at
home
your
mind
is
adjusted
to
horrors
that
chap
came
as
a
shock
and
a
surprise
to
me
every
time
i
get
used
to
him
whereas
out
here
everything
shifted
in
the
queerest
way
your
mind
shifts
you
funk
your
first
and
your
second
sight
say
of
a
bad
stretcher
case
but
when
it
comes
to
the
third
and
the
fourth
you
do
funk
at
all
you
not
shocked
you
not
a
bit
surprised
it
all
in
the
picture
and
you
in
the
picture
too
there
a
sort
of
horrible
harmony
it
like
a
certain
kind
of
beastly
dream
which
does
frighten
you
because
you
part
of
it
part
of
the
beastliness
no
the
thing
that
got
me
so
far
more
than
anything
was
what
think
a
little
dog
no
bigger
than
a
kitten
that
was
run
over
the
other
day
in
the
street
by
a
and
a
civilian
at
that
there
were
two
or
three
women
round
it
crying
and
gesticulating
it
looked
as
if
they
just
lifted
it
out
of
a
bath
of
blood
that
made
me
sick
you
see
the
little
dog
was
in
the
picture
i
bargained
for
him
yet
the
things
morrie
saw
in
south
africa
do
you
remember
how
he
tell
us
about
them
were
in
it
with
the
things
that
happened
here
pounding
apart
the
things
that
corpses
can
do
apparently
on
their
own
are
simply
unbelievable
what
the
war
correspondents
call
fantastic
postures
but
i
have
got
to
the
point
when
i
can
slap
my
thighs
and
roar
with
laughter
if
they
happen
to
be
germans
in
between
the
boredom
is
so
awful
that
i
heard
some
of
our
men
say
they
rather
have
things
happening
and
of
course
we
all
hoping
that
when
those
shells
come
along
there
wo
be
quite
so
much
between
love
to
ronny
and
mother
and
all
of
your
very
affectionate
nicholas
june
france
my
darling
ronny
yes
i
think
all
your
letters
must
have
come
because
you
answered
everything
you
always
tell
me
just
what
i
want
to
know
when
i
see
the
fat
envelopes
coming
i
know
they
going
to
be
of
the
things
i
happened
to
be
thinking
about
do
ever
forget
to
put
the
dates
because
i
make
out
that
i
always
dreamed
about
you
too
the
nights
you
written
and
so
the
aunties
are
working
in
the
war
hospital
supply
depôt
frightfully
funny
what
dorothy
says
about
their
enjoying
the
war
and
feeling
so
important
do
let
her
grudge
it
them
though
it
all
the
enjoyment
or
importance
they
ever
had
in
their
lives
poor
dears
but
i
shall
know
if
a
swab
bursts
in
my
inside
that
it
auntie
edie
as
for
auntie
emmeline
i
ca
even
imagine
what
they
be
like
monstrosities
or
little
babies
injured
at
birth
aunt
would
be
and
firm
but
erring
a
little
on
the
hard
side
do
you
think
that
reminds
me
i
suppose
i
may
tell
you
now
since
it
been
in
the
papers
that
we
actually
got
moving
fortresses
out
here
i
seen
them
yet
but
a
fellow
who
has
thinks
they
must
be
uncommonly
like
drayton
and
my
thing
i
suspect
from
what
he
says
they
a
bit
better
though
we
had
got
the
idea
it
odd
this
time
last
year
i
should
have
gone
off
my
head
with
agony
at
the
mere
thought
of
anybody
getting
in
before
us
and
now
i
care
a
bit
i
do
mind
rather
for
drayton
sake
though
i
do
suppose
he
cares
either
the
great
thing
is
that
it
been
done
and
done
better
anyway
we
been
lucky
supposing
the
germans
had
got
on
to
them
and
trotted
them
out
first
and
one
of
our
own
guns
had
potted
him
or
me
would
have
been
a
jolly
sell
what
makes
you
ask
after
timmy
i
hardly
like
to
tell
you
the
awful
thing
that
happened
to
him
he
had
to
travel
down
to
the
base
hospital
on
a
poor
chap
who
was
shivering
with
and
never
came
back
it
does
matter
because
the
weather
so
warm
now
that
i
do
want
him
but
i
sorry
because
you
all
gave
him
to
me
and
it
looks
as
if
i
had
cared
for
him
but
i
did
june
sorry
i
could
finish
this
last
week
things
developed
rather
suddenly
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
but
we
must
let
on
what
happens
not
even
now
when
it
done
happening
still
there
are
all
the
other
things
i
could
say
anything
about
at
the
time
if
you
know
i
been
up
over
the
top
three
times
now
since
i
came
out
in
february
so
you
see
one
gets
through
all
right
well
i
tried
ages
ago
to
tell
dorothy
what
it
was
like
it
been
like
that
every
time
except
that
i
got
over
the
queer
funky
feeling
through
it
be
like
that
again
next
time
i
know
because
now
i
tested
it
and
ronny
i
could
tell
dorothy
this
because
she
think
it
was
all
rot
but
when
you
up
first
out
of
the
trench
and
stand
alone
on
the
parapet
it
absolute
happiness
and
the
charge
is
well
it
simply
heaven
it
as
if
you
never
really
lived
till
then
i
certainly
had
not
up
to
the
barring
those
three
days
we
had
together
that
why
this
part
mostly
for
michael
there
something
rotten
about
that
poem
he
sent
me
that
somebody
wrote
making
out
that
this
gorgeous
which
is
what
i
suppose
he
trying
for
is
nothing
but
a
form
of
if
he
thinks
that
all
there
is
in
it
he
does
know
much
about
war
or
love
either
though
i
bound
to
say
there
a
clever
chap
in
my
battalion
who
thinks
the
same
thing
he
says
he
feels
the
ecstasy
or
whatever
it
is
all
right
just
the
same
as
i
do
but
that
it
simply
submerged
savagery
bobbing
up
to
the
top
a
hidden
lust
for
killing
and
the
hidden
memory
of
having
killed
he
called
it
he
always
ashamed
of
it
the
next
day
as
if
he
had
been
drunk
and
my
bless
him
says
there
nothing
in
it
but
a
ration
of
rum
ca
be
that
in
my
case
because
i
always
give
mine
to
a
funny
chap
who
he
going
to
have
collywobbles
as
soon
as
he
gets
out
into
the
open
but
that
is
a
bit
what
i
mean
they
all
wrong
about
it
because
they
make
it
turn
on
killing
and
not
on
your
chance
of
being
killed
when
you
realize
it
well
it
like
the
thing
you
told
me
about
that
you
said
you
thought
must
be
god
because
it
so
real
i
understand
it
then
but
i
do
now
you
bang
up
against
reality
going
clean
into
it
and
the
sense
of
it
exquisite
of
course
while
one
half
of
you
is
feeling
like
that
the
other
half
is
fighting
to
kill
and
doing
its
best
to
keep
on
side
reality
but
i
been
near
enough
to
the
other
side
to
know
and
i
wish
michael
friend
would
come
out
and
see
what
it
like
for
himself
or
better
still
mick
write
a
poem
about
it
that
would
make
you
sit
up
it
a
sin
that
i
should
be
getting
all
this
splendid
stuff
when
i
ca
do
anything
with
it
love
to
all
of
them
and
to
your
darling
always
your
loving
nicky
wish
you
try
to
get
some
notion
of
it
into
dad
and
dorothy
and
mother
it
would
save
them
half
the
misery
they
probably
going
through
the
gardener
had
gone
to
the
war
and
veronica
was
in
the
garden
weeding
the
delphinium
border
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
she
was
alone
there
anthony
was
digging
in
the
kitchen
garden
and
frances
was
with
him
gathering
green
peas
and
fruit
for
the
hospital
every
now
and
then
she
came
through
the
open
door
on
to
the
flagged
path
of
the
upper
terrace
with
the
piled
up
baskets
in
her
arms
and
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
veronica
it
was
quiet
in
the
garden
so
that
when
her
moment
came
veronica
could
time
it
by
the
striking
of
the
clock
heard
through
the
open
doorway
of
the
house
four
strokes
and
the
and
then
almost
on
the
stroke
her
rush
of
pure
mysterious
happiness
up
till
then
she
had
been
only
tranquil
and
her
tranquillity
made
each
small
act
exquisite
and
delightful
as
her
fingers
tugged
at
the
weeds
and
shook
the
earth
from
their
weak
roots
and
the
palms
of
her
hand
smoothed
over
the
places
where
they
had
been
she
thought
of
old
jean
and
suzanne
planting
flowers
in
the
garden
at
renton
and
of
that
tranquillity
of
theirs
that
was
the
saddest
thing
she
had
ever
seen
and
her
happiness
had
come
almost
on
the
stroke
of
the
not
out
of
herself
or
out
of
her
thoughts
but
mysteriously
and
from
somewhere
a
long
way
off
she
turned
to
nod
and
smile
at
frances
who
was
coming
through
the
door
with
her
basket
and
it
was
then
that
she
saw
nicholas
he
stood
on
something
that
looked
like
a
low
wall
raised
between
her
and
the
he
stood
motionless
as
if
arrested
in
the
act
of
looking
back
to
see
if
she
were
following
him
his
eyes
shone
vivid
and
blue
as
they
always
shone
when
he
was
happy
he
smiled
at
her
but
with
no
movement
of
his
mouth
he
shouted
to
her
but
with
no
sound
everything
was
still
her
body
and
her
soul
were
still
her
heart
was
still
it
beat
steadily
she
had
started
forwards
to
go
to
him
when
the
tree
thrust
itself
between
them
and
he
was
gone
and
frances
was
still
coming
through
the
door
as
veronica
had
seen
her
when
she
turned
she
was
calling
to
her
to
come
in
out
of
the
sun
xxiv
the
young
men
had
gone
morton
ellis
who
had
said
he
was
damned
if
fight
for
his
country
and
austin
mitchell
who
had
said
he
had
got
a
country
and
who
had
said
that
england
was
not
a
country
you
could
fight
for
george
wadham
had
gone
long
ago
that
michael
said
was
to
be
expected
even
a
weak
gust
could
sweep
young
wadham
off
his
feet
and
he
had
been
fairly
carried
away
he
could
no
more
resist
the
vortex
of
the
war
than
he
could
resist
the
vortex
of
the
arts
michael
had
two
pitiful
memories
of
the
boy
one
of
young
wadham
swaggering
into
stephen
room
in
uniform
the
first
time
he
had
it
on
flushed
and
pleased
with
himself
and
talking
excitedly
about
the
great
game
and
one
of
young
wadham
returned
from
the
front
mature
and
hard
not
talking
about
the
great
game
at
all
and
wincing
palpably
when
other
people
talked
a
young
wadham
who
they
said
ought
to
be
arrested
under
the
defence
of
the
realm
act
as
a
quencher
of
the
others
had
gone
later
one
by
one
each
with
his
own
gesture
mitchell
and
when
stephen
went
ellis
the
day
after
stephen
death
it
had
taken
stephen
death
to
draw
him
only
michael
remained
he
told
them
they
were
mistaken
if
they
thought
their
going
would
inspire
him
to
follow
them
it
and
stephen
death
merely
intensified
the
bitterness
he
felt
towards
the
war
he
was
more
than
ever
determined
to
keep
himself
pure
from
it
consecrated
to
his
forlorn
hope
if
they
fell
back
all
the
more
reason
why
be
should
go
on
and
while
he
waited
for
the
moment
of
vision
he
continued
work
on
the
stephen
had
left
it
to
him
when
he
went
out
michael
tried
to
be
faithful
to
the
tradition
he
thus
inherited
but
gradually
stephen
spirit
disappeared
from
the
and
its
place
was
taken
by
the
clear
hard
unbreakable
thing
that
was
michael
mind
and
michael
knew
that
he
was
beginning
to
make
himself
felt
but
stephen
staff
such
as
it
was
and
nearly
all
his
contributors
had
gone
to
the
war
one
after
another
and
michael
found
himself
taking
all
their
places
he
began
to
feel
a
strain
which
he
took
to
be
the
strain
of
overwork
and
he
went
down
to
renton
to
recover
that
was
on
the
tuesday
that
followed
veronica
sunday
he
thought
that
down
there
he
would
get
away
from
everything
that
did
him
harm
from
his
father
and
mother
eyes
from
his
sister
proud
cold
face
and
from
his
young
brother
smile
and
from
beauty
that
saddened
him
and
from
the
sense
of
nicky
danger
that
brooded
as
a
secret
obsession
over
the
house
he
would
fill
up
the
awful
empty
space
he
thought
for
a
whole
fortnight
i
shall
get
away
from
this
infernal
war
but
he
did
not
get
away
from
it
on
every
stage
of
the
journey
down
he
encountered
soldiers
going
to
the
front
he
walked
in
the
park
at
darlington
between
his
trains
and
wounded
soldiers
waited
for
him
on
every
seat
shuffled
towards
him
round
every
turning
hobbled
after
him
on
their
crutches
down
every
path
their
eyes
looked
at
him
with
a
shrewd
hostility
he
saw
the
young
yorkshire
recruits
drinking
in
the
open
spaces
sergeants
eyes
caught
and
measured
him
appraising
his
physique
behind
and
among
them
he
saw
drayton
and
réveillaud
and
stephen
eyes
and
young
wadham
eyes
strange
and
secretive
and
hard
at
reyburn
michael
train
was
switched
off
to
a
side
platform
in
the
open
before
he
left
darlington
a
thin
light
rain
had
begun
to
fall
from
a
shred
of
blown
cloud
and
at
reyburn
the
burst
mass
was
coming
down
the
place
was
full
of
the
noise
of
rain
the
drops
tapped
on
the
open
platform
and
hissed
as
the
wind
drove
them
in
a
running
stream
they
drummed
loudly
on
the
station
roof
but
these
sounds
went
out
suddenly
covered
by
the
trampling
of
feet
a
band
of
highlanders
with
their
bagpipes
marched
into
the
station
they
lined
up
solemnly
along
the
open
platform
with
their
backs
to
train
and
their
faces
to
the
naked
rails
on
the
other
side
higher
up
michael
could
see
the
breast
of
an
engine
it
was
backing
backing
towards
the
that
waited
under
the
cover
of
the
roof
he
could
hear
the
clank
of
the
coupling
and
the
recoil
at
that
sound
the
band
had
their
mouths
to
their
bagpipes
and
their
fingers
ready
on
the
stops
two
or
three
officers
hurried
down
from
the
station
doors
and
stood
ready
the
train
came
on
slowly
packed
with
men
men
who
thrust
their
heads
and
shoulders
through
the
carriage
windows
and
knelt
on
the
seats
and
stood
straining
over
each
other
backs
to
look
out
men
whose
faces
were
scarlet
with
excitement
men
with
open
mouths
shouting
for
joy
the
officers
saluted
as
it
passed
it
halted
at
the
open
platform
and
suddenly
the
pipers
began
to
play
michael
got
out
of
his
train
and
watched
solemnly
in
the
grey
evening
of
the
rain
with
their
faces
set
in
a
sort
of
stern
esctasy
the
highlanders
played
to
their
comrades
michael
did
not
know
whether
their
tune
was
sad
or
gay
it
poured
itself
into
one
mournful
savage
sacred
cry
of
salutation
and
valediction
when
it
stopped
the
men
shouted
there
were
voices
that
barked
hoarsely
and
broke
voices
that
roared
young
voices
that
screamed
strung
up
by
the
skirling
of
the
bagpipes
the
pipers
played
to
them
again
and
suddenly
michael
was
overcome
pity
shook
him
and
grief
and
an
intolerable
yearning
and
shame
for
one
instant
his
soul
rose
up
above
the
music
and
was
made
splendid
and
holy
the
next
he
cowered
under
it
stripped
and
beaten
he
clenched
his
fists
hating
this
emotion
that
stung
him
to
tears
and
tore
at
his
heart
and
at
the
hardness
of
his
mind
as
the
moved
slowly
out
of
the
station
the
pipers
piping
more
and
more
shrilly
swung
round
and
marched
beside
it
to
the
end
of
the
platform
the
band
ceased
abruptly
and
the
men
answered
with
shout
after
shout
of
violent
joy
they
reared
up
through
the
windows
straining
for
the
last
look
and
were
gone
michael
turned
to
the
porter
who
lifted
his
luggage
from
the
rack
what
regiment
are
they
he
said
camerons
sir
going
to
the
front
the
clear
uncanny
eyes
of
veronica
father
pursued
him
now
at
last
he
had
got
away
from
it
in
rathdale
at
any
rate
there
was
peace
the
hills
and
their
pastures
and
the
flat
river
fields
were
at
peace
and
in
the
villages
of
morfe
and
renton
there
was
peace
for
as
yet
only
a
few
men
had
gone
from
them
the
rest
were
tied
to
the
land
and
they
were
more
absorbed
in
the
than
in
the
war
even
the
old
belgians
in
veronica
cottage
were
at
peace
they
had
forgotten
for
three
days
michael
himself
had
peace
he
went
up
to
veronica
hill
and
sat
on
it
and
thought
how
for
hundreds
of
miles
north
south
east
and
west
of
him
there
was
not
a
soul
whom
he
knew
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
been
more
by
himself
this
solitude
of
his
had
a
singular
effect
on
michael
mind
so
far
from
having
got
away
from
the
war
he
had
never
been
more
conscious
of
it
than
he
was
now
what
he
had
got
away
from
was
other
consciousness
from
the
beginning
the
thing
that
threatened
him
had
been
not
the
war
but
this
collective
clamouring
for
his
private
soul
for
the
first
time
since
august
he
found
himself
thinking
in
perfect
freedom
and
with
perfect
lucidity
about
the
war
he
had
really
known
half
the
time
that
it
was
the
greatest
war
of
independence
that
had
ever
been
as
for
his
old
hatred
of
the
british
empire
he
had
seen
long
ago
that
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
continental
sense
of
empire
there
was
a
unique
thing
the
rule
more
good
than
bad
of
an
imperial
people
he
had
seen
that
the
strength
of
the
allies
was
in
exact
proportion
to
the
strength
and
the
enlightenment
of
their
democracies
reckoning
by
decades
there
could
be
no
deadlock
in
the
struggle
the
deadlock
meant
a
ten
years
armistice
and
another
war
he
could
not
help
seeing
these
things
his
objection
to
occupying
his
mind
with
them
had
been
that
they
were
too
easy
now
that
he
could
look
at
it
by
himself
he
saw
how
the
war
might
take
hold
of
you
like
a
religion
it
was
the
great
war
of
redemption
and
redemption
meant
simply
thousands
and
millions
of
men
in
and
coming
from
the
ends
of
the
world
to
buy
the
freedom
of
the
world
with
their
bodies
it
meant
that
the
very
fields
he
was
looking
over
and
this
beauty
of
the
hills
those
unused
ramparts
where
no
batteries
were
hid
and
the
small
silent
villages
morfe
and
renton
were
bought
now
with
their
bodies
he
wondered
how
at
this
moment
any
sane
man
could
be
a
pacifist
and
wondering
he
felt
a
reminiscent
sting
of
grief
and
yearning
but
he
refused
resolutely
to
feel
any
shame
his
religion
also
was
good
and
anyhow
you
did
choose
your
religion
it
chose
you
and
on
saturday
the
letters
came
john
letter
enclosing
the
wire
from
the
war
office
and
the
letter
that
nicky
colonel
had
written
to
anthony
nicky
was
killed
michael
took
in
the
fact
and
the
date
it
was
last
sunday
there
were
some
official
regrets
but
they
made
no
impression
on
him
john
letter
made
no
impression
on
him
last
sunday
nicky
was
killed
he
had
not
even
unfolded
the
colonel
letter
yet
the
close
black
lines
showed
through
the
thin
paper
their
closeness
repelled
him
he
did
not
want
to
know
how
his
brother
had
died
at
least
not
yet
he
was
afraid
of
the
colonel
letter
he
felt
that
by
simply
not
reading
it
he
could
put
off
the
unbearable
turn
of
the
screw
he
was
shivering
with
cold
he
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
wide
open
where
there
was
no
fire
he
held
out
his
hands
over
it
the
wind
swept
down
the
chimney
and
made
him
colder
and
he
felt
sick
he
had
been
sitting
there
about
an
hour
when
suzanne
came
in
and
asked
him
if
he
would
like
a
little
fire
he
heard
himself
saying
no
thank
you
in
a
hard
voice
the
idea
of
warmth
and
comfort
was
disagreeable
to
him
suzanne
asked
him
then
if
he
had
had
bad
news
and
he
heard
himself
saying
yes
and
suzanne
trying
trying
very
gently
to
persuade
him
that
it
was
perhaps
only
that
monsieur
nicky
was
wounded
no
said
the
old
woman
he
is
killed
and
she
began
to
cry
michael
could
stand
that
he
got
up
and
opened
the
door
into
the
outer
room
and
she
passed
through
before
him
sobbing
and
whimpering
her
voice
came
to
him
through
the
closed
door
in
a
sharp
cry
telling
jean
that
monsieur
nicky
was
dead
and
jean
voice
came
hushing
her
then
he
heard
the
feet
of
the
old
man
shuffling
across
the
kitchen
floor
and
the
outer
door
opening
and
shutting
softly
and
through
the
windows
at
the
back
of
the
room
he
saw
without
heeding
as
the
belgians
passed
and
went
up
into
the
fields
together
weeping
leaving
him
alone
they
had
remembered
it
was
then
that
michael
read
the
colonel
letter
and
learned
the
manner
of
his
brother
death
about
a
quarter
past
four
in
the
afternoon
his
battalion
was
being
pressed
back
when
he
rallied
his
men
and
led
them
in
as
gallant
an
attack
as
was
ever
made
by
so
small
a
number
in
this
war
he
was
standing
on
the
enemy
parapet
when
he
was
shot
through
the
heart
and
fell
by
a
quarter
to
five
the
trench
was
stormed
and
taken
owing
to
his
personal
daring
and
impetus
and
to
the
affection
and
confidence
he
inspired
we
hear
it
continually
said
of
our
officers
and
men
that
all
the
same
and
i
daresay
as
far
as
pluck
goes
they
are
but
if
i
may
say
so
we
all
felt
that
your
son
had
something
that
we
have
got
michael
lay
awake
in
the
bed
that
had
been
his
brother
marriage
bed
the
low
white
ceiling
sagged
and
bulged
above
him
for
three
nights
the
room
had
been
as
if
nicky
and
veronica
had
never
gone
from
it
they
had
compelled
him
to
think
of
them
they
had
lain
where
he
lay
falling
asleep
in
each
other
arms
the
odd
thing
had
been
that
his
acute
and
vivid
sense
of
them
had
in
no
way
troubled
him
it
had
been
simply
there
like
some
exquisite
atmosphere
intensifying
his
peace
he
had
had
the
same
feeling
he
always
had
when
veronica
was
with
him
he
had
liked
to
lie
with
his
head
on
their
pillow
to
touch
what
they
had
touched
to
look
at
the
same
things
in
the
same
room
to
go
in
and
out
through
the
same
doors
over
the
same
floors
remembering
their
hands
and
feet
and
eyes
and
saying
to
himself
they
did
this
and
this
or
that
must
have
pleased
them
it
ought
to
have
been
torture
to
him
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
it
was
not
and
now
on
this
fourth
night
he
had
no
longer
that
sense
of
nicky
and
veronica
together
the
room
had
emptied
itself
of
its
own
memory
and
significance
he
was
aware
of
nothing
but
the
bare
spiritual
space
between
him
and
nicky
he
lay
contemplating
it
steadily
and
without
any
horror
he
thought
this
ends
it
of
course
i
shall
go
out
now
i
might
have
known
that
this
would
end
it
knew
he
remembered
how
nicky
had
come
to
him
in
his
room
that
night
in
august
he
could
see
himself
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
bed
and
nicky
standing
over
him
talking
nicky
had
taken
it
for
granted
even
then
that
he
would
go
out
some
time
he
remembered
how
he
had
said
not
yet
he
thought
of
course
this
must
have
been
what
he
meant
and
presently
he
fell
asleep
exhausted
and
at
the
same
time
appeased
it
was
morning
michael
sleep
dragged
him
down
it
drowned
and
choked
him
as
he
struggled
to
wake
something
had
happened
he
would
know
what
it
was
when
he
came
clear
out
of
this
drowning
now
he
remembered
nicky
was
killed
last
sunday
he
knew
that
but
that
was
all
of
it
there
was
something
else
that
followed
on
suddenly
his
mind
leaped
on
it
he
was
going
out
he
would
be
killed
too
and
because
he
was
going
out
and
because
he
would
be
killed
he
was
not
feeling
nicky
death
so
acutely
as
he
should
have
thought
he
would
have
felt
it
he
had
been
let
off
that
he
lay
still
a
moment
looking
at
the
thing
he
was
going
to
do
feeling
a
certain
pleasure
in
its
fitness
drayton
and
réveillaud
and
lawrence
had
gone
out
and
they
had
been
killed
ellis
and
mitchell
and
were
going
out
and
they
would
certainly
be
killed
wadham
had
gone
out
and
young
vereker
and
they
also
would
be
killed
last
sunday
it
was
nicky
now
it
must
be
he
his
mind
acknowledged
the
rightness
of
the
sequence
without
concern
it
was
aware
that
his
going
depended
on
his
own
will
but
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
brought
so
little
imagination
to
the
act
of
willing
he
got
up
bathed
in
the
river
dressed
and
ate
his
breakfast
he
accepted
each
moment
as
it
arrived
without
imagination
or
concern
then
his
mother
letter
came
frances
wrote
among
other
things
i
know
how
terribly
you
will
be
feeling
it
because
i
know
how
you
cared
for
him
i
wish
i
could
comfort
you
we
could
not
bear
it
michael
if
we
were
not
so
proud
of
him
he
answered
this
letter
at
once
he
wrote
i
could
bear
it
either
if
i
were
not
going
out
but
of
course
i
going
now
as
he
signed
himself
your
loving
michael
he
thought
that
settles
it
yet
if
he
had
considered
what
he
meant
by
settling
it
he
would
have
told
himself
that
he
meant
nothing
that
last
night
had
settled
it
that
his
resolution
had
been
absolutely
and
absolutely
irrevocable
then
and
that
his
signature
gave
it
no
more
sanctity
or
finality
than
it
had
already
if
he
was
conscript
he
was
conscript
to
his
own
will
he
went
out
at
once
with
his
letter
though
he
knew
that
the
post
did
not
leave
renton
for
another
five
hours
it
was
the
sliding
of
this
light
thing
and
its
fall
into
the
that
shook
him
into
realization
of
what
he
had
done
and
of
what
was
before
him
he
knew
now
why
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
write
that
letter
and
to
post
it
by
those
two
slight
acts
not
dreadful
nor
difficult
in
themselves
he
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
withdraw
from
the
one
supremely
difficult
and
dreadful
act
a
second
ago
while
the
letter
was
still
in
his
hands
he
could
have
backed
out
because
he
had
not
given
any
pledge
now
he
would
have
to
go
through
with
it
and
he
saw
clearly
for
the
first
time
what
it
was
that
he
would
have
to
go
through
he
left
the
village
and
went
up
to
renton
moor
and
walked
along
the
top
for
miles
without
knowing
or
caring
where
he
went
and
seeing
nothing
before
him
but
his
own
act
and
what
must
come
afterwards
by
or
the
next
day
at
the
latest
he
would
have
enlisted
by
six
months
at
the
latest
three
months
if
he
had
what
they
called
luck
he
would
be
in
the
trenches
fighting
and
killing
not
because
he
chose
but
because
he
would
be
told
to
fight
and
kill
by
the
simple
act
of
sending
that
letter
to
his
mother
he
was
committed
to
the
whole
ghastly
business
and
he
funked
it
there
was
no
use
lying
to
himself
and
saying
that
he
did
funk
it
even
more
than
the
actual
fighting
and
killing
he
funked
looking
on
at
fighting
and
killing
as
for
being
killed
he
did
think
he
would
really
mind
that
so
much
it
would
come
it
must
come
as
a
relief
from
the
horrors
he
would
have
to
see
before
it
came
nicky
had
said
that
they
were
unbelievable
he
had
seemed
to
think
you
could
imagine
them
if
you
had
seen
them
but
michael
could
he
had
only
to
think
of
them
to
see
them
now
he
could
make
for
himself
in
five
minutes
every
bit
as
terrifying
as
the
things
they
said
happened
under
fire
any
fool
if
he
chose
to
think
about
it
could
see
what
must
happen
only
people
did
think
they
rushed
into
it
without
seeing
anything
and
then
if
they
were
honest
they
owned
that
they
funked
it
before
and
during
and
afterwards
and
all
the
time
nicky
did
but
that
was
only
because
nicky
had
something
that
the
others
had
got
that
he
michael
had
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
as
he
had
said
last
night
this
ends
it
or
as
their
phrase
was
everything
goes
in
now
it
was
indeed
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
end
of
beauty
and
of
the
making
of
beauty
and
of
everything
worth
caring
for
but
it
was
also
the
beginning
of
a
life
that
michael
dreaded
more
than
fighting
and
killing
and
being
killed
a
life
of
boredom
of
obscene
ugliness
of
revolting
contacts
of
intolerable
subjection
for
of
course
he
was
going
into
the
ranks
as
nicky
had
gone
and
already
he
could
feel
the
heat
and
pressure
and
vibration
of
male
bodies
packed
beside
and
around
him
on
the
floor
he
could
hear
their
breathing
he
could
smell
their
fetid
bedding
their
dried
sweat
of
course
he
was
going
through
with
it
only
this
was
the
thought
his
mind
turned
round
and
round
on
in
horror
at
itself
he
funked
it
he
funked
it
so
badly
that
he
would
really
rather
die
than
go
through
with
it
when
he
was
actually
killed
that
would
be
his
second
death
months
before
it
could
happen
he
would
have
known
all
about
it
he
would
have
been
dead
and
buried
and
alive
again
in
hell
what
shocked
michael
was
his
discovering
not
that
he
funked
it
now
which
was
natural
almost
permissible
but
that
he
had
funked
it
all
the
time
he
could
see
now
that
since
the
war
began
he
had
been
struggling
to
keep
out
of
it
his
mind
had
fought
every
suggestion
that
he
should
go
in
it
had
run
to
cover
like
a
mad
frightened
animal
before
the
thoughts
that
hunted
it
down
funk
pure
funk
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
all
he
had
said
and
thought
and
done
since
august
his
attitude
to
the
war
his
opinion
of
the
allies
and
of
the
government
and
of
its
conduct
of
the
war
all
his
wretched
criticisms
and
disparagements
what
had
they
been
but
the
very
subterfuges
of
funk
his
mother
had
known
it
his
father
had
known
it
and
dorothy
and
john
it
was
not
conceivable
that
nicky
did
not
know
it
that
was
what
had
made
the
horror
of
the
empty
space
that
separated
them
lawrence
stephen
had
certainly
known
it
he
could
not
understand
his
not
knowing
it
himself
not
seeing
that
he
struggled
yet
he
must
have
seen
that
nicky
death
would
end
it
anyhow
it
ended
if
not
last
night
then
this
morning
when
he
posted
the
letter
but
he
was
no
longer
appeased
by
this
certainty
of
his
he
was
going
out
all
right
but
merely
going
out
was
not
enough
what
counted
was
the
state
of
mind
in
which
you
went
lawrence
had
said
victory
victory
is
a
state
of
mind
well
it
was
a
state
that
came
naturally
to
nicky
and
did
not
come
naturally
to
him
it
was
all
very
well
for
nicky
he
had
wanted
to
go
he
had
gone
out
victorious
before
victory
michael
would
go
beaten
before
defeat
he
thought
if
this
is
volunteering
give
me
compulsion
all
the
same
he
was
going
all
morning
and
afternoon
as
he
walked
and
walked
his
thoughts
went
the
same
round
and
in
the
evening
they
began
again
but
on
a
new
track
he
thought
it
all
very
well
to
say
i
going
but
how
i
go
he
had
lawrence
stephen
work
to
do
lawrence
life
and
letters
were
in
his
hands
how
could
he
possibly
go
and
leave
lawrence
dead
and
forgotten
this
view
seemed
to
him
to
be
sanity
and
common
sense
as
his
mind
darted
up
this
turning
it
was
driven
back
he
saw
lawrence
stephen
smiling
at
him
as
he
had
smiled
at
him
when
réveillaud
died
lawrence
would
have
wanted
him
to
go
more
than
anything
he
would
have
chosen
to
be
dead
and
forgotten
rather
than
keep
him
at
night
these
thoughts
left
him
he
began
to
think
of
nicky
and
of
his
people
his
father
and
mother
would
never
be
happy
again
nicky
had
been
more
to
them
than
he
was
or
even
john
he
had
been
more
to
dorothy
it
was
hard
on
dorothy
to
lose
nicky
and
drayton
too
he
thought
of
nicky
and
veronica
poor
little
ronny
what
would
she
do
without
nicky
he
thought
of
veronica
sitting
silent
in
the
train
and
looking
at
him
with
her
startling
look
of
spiritual
maturity
he
thought
of
veronica
singing
to
him
over
and
over
again
london
bridge
is
broken
down
build
it
up
with
gold
so
fine
build
it
up
with
stones
so
strong
he
thought
of
veronica
running
about
the
house
and
crying
nicky
i
want
him
monday
was
like
sunday
except
that
he
walked
up
karva
hill
in
the
morning
and
up
greffington
edge
in
the
afternoon
instead
of
renton
moor
whichever
way
he
went
his
thoughts
went
the
same
way
as
yesterday
the
images
were
if
anything
more
crowded
and
more
horrible
but
they
had
lost
their
hold
he
was
tired
of
looking
at
them
about
five
he
turned
abruptly
and
went
back
to
the
village
the
same
way
by
which
he
came
and
as
he
swung
down
the
hill
road
in
sight
of
renton
suddenly
there
was
a
great
clearance
in
his
soul
when
he
went
into
the
cottage
he
found
veronica
there
waiting
for
him
she
sat
with
her
hands
lying
in
her
lap
and
she
had
the
same
look
he
had
seen
when
she
was
in
the
train
ronny
she
stood
up
to
greet
him
as
if
it
had
been
she
who
was
staying
there
and
he
who
had
incredibly
arrived
they
told
me
you
would
be
long
she
said
i
you
have
come
because
you
were
ill
or
anything
she
smiled
and
shook
her
head
no
not
for
anything
like
that
i
did
write
ronny
i
could
i
know
their
eyes
met
measuring
each
other
grief
that
why
i
came
i
could
bear
to
leave
you
to
it
i
have
come
before
michael
if
you
wanted
me
they
were
sitting
together
now
on
the
settle
by
the
i
ca
understand
your
being
able
to
think
of
me
he
said
because
of
nicky
if
i
have
got
nicky
it
all
the
more
reason
why
i
should
think
of
his
people
he
looked
up
i
say
how
are
they
mother
and
father
they
very
brave
it
worse
for
them
than
it
is
for
me
she
said
what
they
ca
bear
is
your
going
mother
got
my
letter
then
yes
this
morning
what
did
she
say
she
said
no
michael
it
was
a
good
thing
you
wrote
though
your
letter
made
her
cry
it
made
even
dorothy
cry
they
had
been
able
to
before
i
should
have
thought
if
they
could
stand
nicky
going
that
was
different
they
know
it
was
different
do
you
suppose
do
know
how
different
it
was
they
mean
i
funked
it
and
nicky
did
they
mean
that
nicky
got
what
he
wanted
when
he
went
and
that
there
was
nothing
else
he
could
have
done
so
well
except
flying
or
engineering
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
nicky
simply
was
afraid
yes
michael
he
afraid
what
he
was
most
awfully
afraid
of
seeing
suffering
well
so
am
i
and
i
afraid
of
suffering
myself
too
i
afraid
of
the
whole
blessed
thing
from
beginning
to
end
that
because
you
keep
on
seeing
the
whole
blessed
thing
from
beginning
to
end
nicky
only
saw
little
bits
of
it
the
bits
he
liked
working
beautifully
and
shells
dropping
in
the
right
places
and
trenches
being
taken
and
then
remember
nicky
had
so
much
to
give
up
he
had
you
oh
no
he
knew
that
was
the
way
to
keep
me
ronny
if
nicky
had
been
like
me
could
he
have
kept
you
she
considered
it
yes
if
he
could
have
been
himself
too
he
could
you
see
he
never
could
have
felt
like
that
i
do
say
he
could
well
the
awful
thing
is
like
that
and
the
magnificent
thing
is
like
that
and
going
all
the
same
everybody
knows
that
but
you
michael
yes
he
said
i
but
i
not
going
to
lie
about
it
and
say
i
do
funk
it
because
i
do
you
do
i
own
i
did
the
first
night
the
night
i
knew
nicky
was
killed
because
i
could
think
of
anything
else
nicky
it
was
after
i
written
to
mother
that
it
came
on
because
i
knew
then
i
could
back
out
of
it
that
what
i
ca
get
over
my
having
to
do
that
to
clinch
it
because
i
was
afraid
my
dear
my
dear
thousands
of
men
do
that
every
day
for
the
same
reason
only
they
do
find
themselves
out
and
if
they
did
they
would
care
you
finding
yourself
out
all
the
time
and
killing
yourself
with
caring
of
course
i
care
ca
you
see
it
proves
that
i
never
meant
to
go
at
all
it
proves
that
you
knew
you
have
to
go
through
hell
first
and
you
were
determined
that
even
hell
should
keep
you
back
ronny
that
what
it
been
simply
hell
it
been
inconceivable
nothing
absolutely
nothing
out
there
could
be
as
bad
it
went
on
all
yesterday
and
till
you
came
i
know
michael
that
why
i
came
to
get
me
out
of
it
to
get
you
out
of
it
it
all
over
she
said
it
may
come
back
out
there
it
wo
out
there
you
be
happy
i
saw
nicky
on
sunday
the
minute
before
he
was
killed
michael
and
he
was
happy
he
would
be
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
ronny
did
nicky
know
i
funked
it
never
he
knew
you
would
keep
out
all
he
minded
was
your
missing
any
of
it
she
got
up
and
put
on
her
hat
i
must
go
it
getting
late
will
you
walk
up
to
morfe
with
me
i
sleeping
there
in
the
hotel
no
i
say
i
not
going
to
let
you
turn
out
for
me
sleep
at
the
hotel
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
sort
of
wonder
as
if
she
thought
has
he
forgotten
so
soon
and
he
remembered
i
ca
stop
here
she
said
that
would
be
more
than
even
can
bear
he
thought
she
gone
through
hell
herself
to
get
me
out
of
it
may
france
dearest
mother
and
father
yes
captain
please
i
can
hardly
believe
it
myself
but
it
is
so
it
was
thundering
good
luck
getting
into
dear
old
nicky
regiment
the
whole
thing
incredible
but
promotion
nothing
everybody
getting
it
like
lightning
now
no
sooner
striped
than
you
starred
i
glad
i
resisted
the
adjutant
and
worked
up
from
the
ranks
i
own
it
was
a
bit
beastly
at
the
time
quite
as
beastly
as
nicky
said
it
would
be
but
it
was
worth
while
going
through
with
it
especially
living
in
the
trenches
as
a
tommy
there
nothing
like
it
for
making
you
know
your
men
you
can
tell
exactly
what
going
to
bother
them
and
what
is
you
got
your
finger
on
the
pulse
of
their
morale
not
that
it
jumpier
than
yours
it
is
and
their
knowing
that
they
got
to
stand
anything
that
you
have
stood
gives
you
no
end
of
a
pull
honestly
i
do
believe
i
could
have
faced
them
if
it
was
for
that
so
that
morale
the
better
for
it
as
well
as
theirs
you
know
if
you
shot
down
this
minute
it
wo
matter
the
weediest
tommy
in
your
company
can
carry
on
a
funny
crowd
in
my
billet
all
risen
from
the
ranks
except
my
senior
john
would
love
us
there
a
chap
who
writes
short
stories
and
goes
out
very
earnestly
among
the
corpses
to
find
copy
and
another
who
was
in
the
publishing
business
and
harks
back
to
it
now
and
then
in
a
dreamy
nostalgic
way
and
rather
as
if
he
wanted
to
rub
it
into
us
writing
chaps
what
he
do
for
us
only
he
would
and
there
a
tailor
who
swears
he
could
tell
a
mile
off
where
my
tunic
came
from
and
a
lawyer
clerk
who
sticks
his
cigarette
behind
his
ear
we
used
to
wonder
what
he
do
with
his
revolver
till
we
saw
what
he
did
with
it
they
all
love
thinking
of
what
they
been
and
telling
you
about
it
i
almost
wish
i
gone
into
daddy
business
then
perhaps
know
what
it
feels
like
to
go
straight
out
of
a
shop
or
an
office
into
the
most
glorious
army
in
history
i
forgot
the
jew
pawnbroker
at
least
we
he
a
pawnbroker
always
inventing
things
stupendous
and
impossible
things
his
last
idea
was
fourteen
feet
high
that
take
in
shells
exactly
as
a
takes
in
bullets
he
says
you
see
them
in
the
next
war
when
you
ask
him
how
he
going
to
transport
and
emplace
and
hide
his
he
looks
dejected
and
says
i
never
thought
of
and
has
another
idea
at
once
even
more
impossible
that
reminds
me
i
seen
the
tanks
nicky
moving
fortresses
in
action
i
give
my
promotion
if
only
he
could
have
seen
them
too
we
must
call
them
fortresses
any
more
they
most
violently
for
attack
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
nicky
and
drayton
thing
was
something
between
these
and
the
french
ones
otherwise
one
might
have
wondered
whether
their
plans
and
models
really
did
go
where
john
says
they
did
i
wish
i
could
believe
that
nicky
and
drayton
really
had
a
hand
in
it
i
most
awfully
grieved
to
hear
that
young
vereker
reported
missing
do
you
remember
how
excited
he
used
to
be
dashing
about
the
lawn
at
tennis
and
how
alice
lathom
used
to
sit
and
look
at
him
and
jump
if
you
brought
her
her
tea
too
suddenly
let
hope
we
have
finished
up
this
damned
war
before
they
get
little
norris
love
to
dorothy
and
don
and
your
loving
mick
when
frances
read
that
letter
she
said
i
wonder
if
he
really
is
all
right
he
says
very
little
about
himself
and
anthony
said
then
you
may
be
sure
he
is
may
france
my
dear
ronny
i
glad
mummy
and
father
have
got
all
my
letters
they
wo
mind
my
writing
to
you
this
time
it
really
your
turn
now
thanks
for
wadham
poems
i
wish
they
been
ellis
it
a
shame
to
laugh
at
waddy
but
he
spread
himself
over
flanders
he
like
the
inundations
round
ypres
i
most
awfully
touched
at
dad
and
mummy
wanting
to
publish
mine
here
they
all
are
just
as
i
wrote
them
in
our
billet
at
night
or
in
the
early
morning
when
the
others
were
sleeping
and
i
was
i
do
know
whether
they
bad
or
good
i
have
had
time
to
think
about
them
it
all
seems
so
incredibly
far
away
even
last
week
seems
far
away
you
go
on
so
fast
here
i
like
ellis
and
to
see
them
and
to
weed
out
the
bad
ones
but
you
must
ask
them
to
do
anything
they
have
time
either
i
think
you
and
dorothy
and
dad
will
manage
it
all
right
among
you
if
you
do
i
sha
much
care
of
course
i
glad
that
they
taken
you
on
at
the
hampstead
hospital
if
it
makes
you
happier
to
nurse
and
i
glad
dad
put
his
foot
down
on
your
going
to
vera
she
gave
you
up
to
my
people
and
she
ca
take
you
back
now
i
sorry
for
her
though
so
is
he
have
i
had
any
adventures
by
myself
only
two
i
given
up
what
mother
calls
my
not
wanting
to
go
to
the
party
one
came
off
in
no
man
land
the
other
night
i
went
out
with
a
party
and
came
back
by
myself
unless
you
count
a
damaged
tommy
hanging
on
to
me
it
began
in
pleasurable
excitement
and
ended
in
some
perturbation
for
i
had
to
get
him
in
under
cover
somehow
and
my
responsibility
weighed
on
me
so
did
he
the
other
was
ages
ago
in
a
german
trench
i
was
by
myself
because
i
gone
in
too
quick
and
the
party
behind
me
took
the
wrong
turning
i
did
manage
to
squeeze
a
chilly
excitement
out
of
going
on
alone
then
i
bumped
up
against
a
fat
german
officer
and
his
revolver
that
really
was
an
exquisite
moment
and
i
was
beast
enough
to
be
glad
i
had
it
all
to
myself
it
meant
a
bag
of
fifteen
prisoners
all
my
own
but
that
was
nothing
they
have
surrendered
to
a
mouse
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
because
i
fired
first
and
there
was
no
more
officer
to
play
up
to
but
the
things
you
do
do
by
yourself
are
a
long
way
the
best
nothing
not
even
poetry
can
beat
an
infantry
charge
when
leading
it
that
because
of
your
men
it
feels
as
if
you
were
drawing
them
all
up
after
you
of
course
you
are
they
coming
on
their
own
and
you
simply
nothing
only
a
little
unimportant
part
of
them
even
when
you
feeling
as
if
you
were
god
almighty
i
afraid
it
look
awfully
as
if
young
vereker
were
killed
they
may
hear
you
know
in
some
roundabout
way
through
the
red
cross
or
some
of
his
men
i
written
to
them
love
to
everybody
certainly
you
may
kiss
nanna
for
me
if
she
like
it
i
wish
i
liked
waddy
more
when
you
given
him
to
always
your
affectionate
michael
i
do
sound
pleased
about
the
publication
but
i
am
i
ca
get
over
their
wanting
to
do
it
i
thought
they
did
care
ronny
i
been
such
a
beast
to
them
when
father
tried
to
read
my
stuff
bless
him
and
could
i
used
to
wish
to
god
he
leave
it
alone
and
now
i
give
anything
to
see
his
dear
old
paws
hanging
on
to
it
and
twitching
with
fright
and
his
eyes
slewing
round
to
see
if
looking
at
him
june
france
my
dear
ronny
i
glad
you
like
them
and
i
glad
father
thinks
he
understands
michael
poems
this
time
and
i
glad
they
made
mother
and
dorothy
feel
happier
about
me
but
they
must
get
it
out
of
their
heads
that
they
my
message
or
any
putrescent
thing
of
that
sort
the
bare
idea
of
writing
a
message
or
of
being
supposed
to
write
a
message
makes
me
sick
i
know
it
beastly
of
me
but
really
rather
they
were
published
at
all
if
there
the
smallest
chance
of
their
being
taken
that
way
but
if
ellis
is
doing
the
introduction
there
is
the
smallest
chance
thank
god
for
ellis
there
i
let
off
all
my
beastliness
and
now
i
try
to
answer
your
letter
yes
the
ecstasy
in
the
last
two
poems
nicky
ecstasy
and
as
ellis
says
it
strikes
him
as
absolutely
real
i
take
it
that
some
of
nicky
reality
has
got
through
it
hard
on
ellis
that
he
has
to
take
ecstasy
from
me
instead
of
coming
out
and
getting
it
for
himself
but
you
and
nicky
and
lawrence
are
right
it
absolutely
real
i
mean
it
has
to
do
with
absolute
reality
with
god
it
has
anything
to
do
with
having
courage
or
not
having
courage
it
another
state
of
mind
altogether
it
is
what
nicky
man
said
it
was
you
not
ashamed
of
it
the
next
day
it
is
excitement
you
not
excited
it
is
a
tingling
of
your
nerves
they
do
tingle
it
all
curiously
quiet
and
steady
you
remember
when
you
saw
nicky
how
everything
stood
still
and
how
two
times
were
going
on
and
you
and
nicky
were
in
one
time
and
mother
was
in
the
other
well
it
like
that
your
body
and
its
nerves
are
in
it
at
all
your
body
may
be
moving
violently
with
other
bodies
moving
violently
round
it
but
still
but
suppose
it
is
your
nerves
why
should
they
tingle
at
just
that
particular
moment
the
moment
that
makes
afraid
why
should
you
be
so
extraordinarily
happy
why
should
the
moment
of
extreme
danger
be
always
the
exquisite
moment
why
not
the
moment
of
safety
does
it
look
as
if
danger
were
the
point
of
contact
with
reality
and
death
the
closest
point
you
through
actually
you
lay
hold
on
eternal
life
and
you
know
it
another
thing
it
always
comes
with
that
little
shock
of
recognition
it
happened
before
and
when
you
get
near
to
it
again
you
know
what
it
is
you
keep
on
wanting
to
get
near
it
wanting
it
to
happen
again
you
may
lose
it
the
next
minute
but
you
know
lawrence
knew
what
it
was
nicky
knew
june
i
coming
back
to
it
after
that
interruption
because
i
want
to
get
the
thing
clear
i
have
to
put
it
down
as
i
feel
it
there
no
other
way
but
they
must
think
it
something
that
only
lawrence
and
nicky
and
i
feel
the
men
feel
it
too
even
when
they
do
know
what
it
is
and
some
of
them
know
of
course
we
shall
be
accused
of
glorifying
war
and
telling
lies
about
it
well
there
a
frenchman
who
has
told
the
truth
piling
up
all
the
horrors
faithfully
remorselessly
magnificently
but
he
seems
to
think
people
ought
to
write
about
this
war
at
all
unless
they
show
up
the
infamy
of
it
as
a
deterrent
so
that
no
government
can
ever
start
another
one
it
a
sort
of
literary
frightfulness
but
who
is
he
trying
to
frighten
does
he
imagine
that
france
or
england
or
russia
or
belgium
or
serbia
will
want
to
start
another
war
when
this
is
over
and
does
he
suppose
that
germany
if
we
do
beat
her
will
be
deterred
by
his
frightfulness
germany
arrogance
will
be
satisfied
when
she
knows
she
made
a
frenchman
feel
like
that
about
it
he
got
his
truth
all
right
as
morrie
would
say
that
war
but
a
peaceful
earthquake
can
do
much
the
same
thing
and
if
truth
what
seen
is
war
at
any
rate
it
what
we
got
out
of
it
our
glory
our
spiritual
compensation
for
the
physical
torture
and
there
would
be
a
sort
of
infamy
in
trying
to
take
it
from
us
it
the
french
government
or
the
british
that
fighting
germany
we
all
of
us
to
insist
on
the
world
remembering
nothing
but
these
horrors
is
as
if
men
up
to
their
knees
in
the
filth
they
clearing
away
should
complain
of
each
other
for
standing
in
it
and
splashing
it
about
the
filth
of
war
and
the
physical
torture
good
god
as
if
the
world
was
likely
to
forget
it
any
more
than
we
likely
to
forget
what
know
you
remember
because
you
known
it
before
and
it
all
hangs
together
it
not
as
if
danger
were
the
only
point
of
contact
with
reality
you
get
the
same
ecstasy
the
same
shock
of
recognition
and
the
same
utter
satisfaction
when
you
see
a
beautiful
thing
at
least
to
me
it
like
that
you
know
what
nicky
thought
it
was
like
you
know
what
it
was
like
when
you
used
to
sit
looking
and
looking
at
mother
tree
of
heaven
it
odd
ronny
to
have
gone
all
your
life
trying
to
get
reality
trying
to
get
new
beauty
trying
to
get
utter
satisfaction
to
have
funked
coming
out
here
because
you
thought
it
was
all
obscene
ugliness
and
waste
and
frustration
and
then
to
come
out
and
to
find
what
you
wanted
june
i
wrote
all
that
while
i
could
because
i
want
to
make
them
see
it
it
horrible
that
dorothy
should
think
that
drayton
dead
and
that
mother
should
think
that
nicky
dead
when
they
would
if
they
really
knew
if
they
do
believe
lawrence
or
me
ca
they
believe
nicky
i
only
saying
what
he
said
but
i
ca
write
to
them
about
it
because
they
make
me
shy
and
i
afraid
they
think
i
only
gassing
or
making
poetry
as
if
poetry
was
the
most
real
thing
there
is
if
anybody
can
make
them
see
it
you
always
your
affectionate
michael
xxv
anthony
was
going
into
the
house
to
take
back
the
key
of
the
workshop
he
had
locked
the
door
of
the
workshop
a
year
ago
after
nicky
death
and
had
not
opened
it
again
until
this
afternoon
in
the
orchard
he
had
seen
that
the
props
of
the
old
were
broken
and
he
had
thought
that
he
would
like
to
make
new
ones
and
the
wood
was
in
the
workshop
everything
in
there
was
as
it
had
been
when
nicky
finished
with
his
moving
fortress
the
brass
and
steel
filings
lay
in
a
heap
under
the
lathe
the
handle
was
tilted
at
the
point
where
he
had
left
it
pits
in
the
showed
where
his
feet
had
stood
his
overalls
hung
over
the
bench
where
he
had
slipped
them
off
anthony
had
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
had
looked
at
these
things
with
remembrance
and
foreboding
he
thought
of
nicky
and
of
nicky
pleasure
and
excitement
over
the
unpacking
of
his
first
lathe
the
one
he
had
begged
for
for
his
birthday
and
of
his
own
pleasure
and
excitement
as
he
watched
his
boy
handling
it
and
showing
him
so
cleverly
how
it
worked
it
stood
there
still
in
the
corner
nicky
had
given
it
to
veronica
he
had
taught
her
how
to
use
it
and
anthony
thought
of
veronica
when
she
was
little
he
saw
nicky
taking
care
of
her
teaching
her
to
run
and
ride
and
play
games
and
he
remembered
what
mother
had
said
to
him
and
frances
wait
till
nicky
has
children
of
his
own
he
thought
of
john
john
had
volunteered
three
times
and
had
been
three
times
rejected
and
now
conscription
had
got
him
he
had
to
appear
before
the
board
of
examiners
that
afternoon
he
might
be
rejected
again
but
the
standard
was
not
so
exacting
as
it
had
been
john
might
be
taken
he
thought
of
his
business
john
business
and
his
and
bartie
those
big
government
contracts
had
more
than
saved
them
they
were
making
tons
of
money
out
of
the
war
even
when
the
government
cut
down
their
profits
even
when
they
had
given
more
than
half
they
made
to
the
war
funds
the
fact
remained
that
they
were
living
on
the
war
bartie
without
a
wife
or
children
was
appallingly
rich
if
john
were
taken
if
john
were
killed
if
michael
died
michael
had
been
reported
seriously
wounded
he
had
thought
then
of
michael
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
bear
thinking
any
more
he
had
got
up
and
left
the
workshop
locking
the
door
behind
him
forgetting
what
he
had
gone
in
for
and
he
had
taken
the
key
back
to
the
house
he
kept
it
in
what
his
children
used
to
call
the
secret
drawer
of
his
bureau
it
lay
there
with
nicky
last
letter
of
june
and
a
slab
of
coromandel
wood
it
was
when
he
was
going
into
the
house
with
the
key
that
john
met
him
have
they
taken
you
yes
john
face
was
hard
and
white
they
went
together
into
anthony
room
it
what
you
wanted
anthony
said
of
course
it
what
i
wanted
i
want
it
more
than
ever
now
the
wire
come
father
mother
opened
it
it
was
five
days
now
since
they
had
heard
that
michael
had
died
of
his
wounds
frances
was
in
michael
room
she
was
waiting
for
dorothea
and
veronica
to
help
her
to
find
his
papers
it
was
eight
in
the
evening
and
they
had
to
be
sorted
and
laid
out
ready
for
morton
ellis
to
look
over
them
morton
ellis
would
come
and
he
would
take
them
away
the
doors
of
michael
and
of
nicky
rooms
were
always
kept
shut
frances
knew
that
if
she
were
to
open
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
corridor
and
look
in
every
thing
in
nicky
room
would
welcome
her
with
tenderness
even
while
it
inflicted
its
unique
and
separate
wound
but
michael
room
was
bare
and
silent
he
had
cleared
everything
away
out
of
her
sight
last
year
before
he
went
the
very
books
on
the
shelves
repudiated
her
reminded
her
that
she
had
never
understood
him
that
he
had
always
escaped
her
his
room
kept
his
secret
and
she
felt
afraid
and
abashed
in
it
knowing
herself
an
intruder
presently
all
that
was
most
precious
in
it
would
be
taken
from
her
and
given
over
to
a
stranger
whom
he
had
never
liked
her
mind
turned
and
fastened
on
one
object
the
stiff
naked
wooden
chair
standing
in
its
place
before
the
oak
table
by
the
window
she
remembered
how
she
had
come
to
michael
there
and
found
him
writing
at
his
table
and
how
she
had
talked
to
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
shirker
and
a
coward
she
had
borne
nicky
death
but
she
could
not
bear
michael
she
stood
there
in
his
room
staring
hypnotized
by
her
memory
she
heard
dorothea
come
in
and
go
out
again
and
then
veronica
came
in
she
turned
to
veronica
to
help
her
she
clung
to
veronica
and
was
jealous
of
her
veronica
had
not
come
between
her
and
nicky
as
long
as
he
was
alive
but
now
that
he
was
dead
she
came
between
them
she
came
between
her
and
michael
too
mind
had
always
been
beyond
her
she
could
only
reach
it
through
veronica
and
through
veronica
secret
her
mind
clutched
at
secret
and
flung
it
away
as
useless
and
returned
clutching
at
it
again
it
was
as
if
veronica
held
the
souls
of
michael
and
nicholas
in
her
hands
she
offered
her
the
souls
of
her
dead
sons
she
was
the
mediator
between
her
and
their
souls
i
could
bear
it
veronica
if
i
had
made
him
go
i
came
to
him
here
in
this
room
and
bullied
him
till
he
went
i
said
horrible
things
to
him
that
he
must
have
remembered
he
was
like
nicky
it
was
infinitely
worse
for
him
and
i
was
cruel
to
him
i
had
no
pity
i
drove
him
out
to
be
killed
and
i
simply
can
not
bear
it
but
he
did
go
then
he
waited
till
till
he
was
free
if
anybody
could
have
made
him
nicky
could
but
it
was
even
nicky
it
was
himself
if
he
been
killed
as
nicky
was
but
to
die
like
that
in
the
hospital
of
those
horrible
wounds
he
was
leading
a
charge
just
as
nicky
was
and
you
know
he
was
happy
just
as
nicky
was
every
line
he
written
shows
that
he
was
happy
it
only
shows
that
they
were
both
full
of
life
that
they
loved
their
life
and
wanted
to
live
it
no
use
ronny
you
saying
you
know
they
there
i
do
give
anything
to
believe
it
and
yet
it
would
be
a
bit
of
good
if
i
did
i
do
them
all
changed
into
something
spiritual
that
i
should
know
if
it
was
there
i
want
their
bodies
with
me
just
as
they
used
to
be
i
want
to
hear
them
and
touch
them
and
see
them
come
in
in
their
old
clothes
to
see
nicky
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
timmy
in
his
arms
i
want
things
like
that
ronny
even
if
you
right
it
all
clean
gone
her
lips
tightened
i
talking
as
if
i
was
the
only
one
but
i
know
it
worse
for
you
ronny
i
them
all
those
years
and
i
got
anthony
you
had
nothing
but
your
poor
three
days
veronica
thought
how
can
i
tell
her
that
i
got
more
than
she
thinks
it
awful
that
i
should
have
what
she
has
she
was
ashamed
and
beaten
before
this
irreparable
mortal
grief
and
it
worse
frances
said
for
the
wretched
mothers
whose
sons
have
fought
for
her
pride
rose
in
her
again
the
pride
that
uplifted
her
supernaturally
when
nicky
died
you
must
think
i
grudge
them
i
do
i
do
even
grudge
john
the
silence
of
michael
room
sank
into
them
it
weighed
on
their
hearts
and
they
were
afraid
of
each
other
voices
frances
was
glad
when
dorothy
came
and
they
could
begin
their
work
there
but
michael
had
not
left
them
much
to
do
they
found
his
papers
all
in
one
drawer
of
his
sorted
and
packed
and
labelled
ready
for
morton
ellis
to
take
away
one
sealed
envelope
lay
in
a
place
by
itself
frances
thought
he
did
want
any
of
us
to
touch
his
things
then
she
saw
veronica
name
on
the
sealed
envelope
she
was
glad
when
veronica
left
them
and
went
to
her
hospital
and
when
she
was
gone
she
wanted
her
back
again
i
wish
i
had
spoken
that
way
to
veronica
she
said
she
wo
mind
she
knows
you
could
help
it
i
could
dorothy
if
i
was
jealous
of
her
i
mean
i
jealous
of
her
certainty
if
i
had
it
too
i
should
be
jealous
she
wants
you
to
have
it
she
trying
to
give
it
you
mother
how
do
we
know
she
is
right
nicky
said
she
was
and
michael
said
nicky
was
right
if
it
had
been
only
nicky
might
have
got
it
from
veronica
but
michael
never
got
things
from
anybody
and
you
know
things
in
queer
ways
even
i
do
at
least
i
did
once
when
i
was
in
prison
i
knew
something
tremendous
was
going
to
happen
i
saw
it
or
felt
it
or
something
i
wo
swear
i
knew
it
was
the
war
i
do
suppose
i
did
but
i
knew
frank
was
all
mixed
up
with
it
and
it
was
the
most
awfully
real
thing
you
could
go
back
on
it
or
get
behind
it
it
was
as
if
i
seen
that
he
and
lawrence
and
nicky
and
michael
and
all
of
them
would
die
in
it
to
save
the
whole
world
like
christ
only
that
they
really
die
and
the
whole
world
saved
there
was
nothing
futile
about
it
well
well
might
see
their
real
thing
the
same
way
in
a
flash
are
they
a
thousand
times
more
likely
to
know
than
we
are
what
right
have
we
sitting
here
safe
to
say
it
is
when
they
say
it
is
but
if
there
anything
in
it
why
ca
i
see
it
as
well
as
you
and
veronica
after
all
i
their
mother
perhaps
that
why
it
takes
you
longer
mummy
you
think
of
their
bodies
more
than
we
do
because
they
were
part
of
your
body
their
souls
or
whatever
it
is
are
as
real
to
you
just
at
first
i
see
said
frances
bitterly
you
only
got
to
be
a
mother
and
give
your
children
your
flesh
and
blood
to
be
sure
of
their
souls
going
from
you
and
somebody
else
getting
them
that
the
price
you
pay
for
being
mothers
was
frank
soul
ever
more
real
to
dorothy
yes
it
was
once
for
just
one
minute
the
night
he
went
away
another
queer
thing
that
happened
it
did
satisfy
you
darling
did
it
of
course
it
did
satisfy
me
i
want
more
and
more
of
it
not
just
flashes
you
say
it
the
price
we
pay
for
being
mothers
yet
if
veronica
had
had
a
child
you
need
be
so
sorry
for
veronica
i
not
it
you
i
sorriest
for
you
had
nothing
from
beginning
to
end
you
had
nothing
i
might
at
least
have
seen
that
you
had
it
in
the
beginning
mummy
yes
me
you
have
it
now
unless
you
want
to
leave
me
i
would
leave
you
for
the
world
mummy
ducky
only
you
must
let
me
work
always
and
all
the
time
let
you
i
let
you
do
what
you
like
my
dear
you
always
have
let
me
have
you
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
poor
mummy
did
you
think
you
had
to
make
up
because
you
cared
for
them
more
than
me
i
wonder
said
frances
thoughtfully
if
i
did
of
course
of
course
you
did
who
would
i
never
meant
you
to
know
it
dorothy
of
course
i
knew
it
i
must
have
known
it
ever
since
michael
was
born
i
knew
you
could
help
it
you
had
to
even
when
i
was
a
tiresome
kid
i
knew
you
had
to
it
was
natural
natural
or
unnatural
many
girls
have
hated
their
mothers
for
less
you
been
very
big
and
generous
perhaps
if
you
been
little
and
weak
but
you
were
always
such
an
independent
thing
i
used
to
think
you
did
want
me
i
wanted
you
a
lot
more
than
you
thought
but
you
see
i
learned
to
do
without
she
thought
it
better
she
should
have
it
straight
if
you
think
less
about
me
mother
she
said
and
more
about
father
father
yes
father
is
independent
though
he
looks
it
he
wants
you
awfully
he
always
has
wanted
you
and
he
has
learned
to
do
without
where
is
he
he
sitting
out
there
in
the
garden
all
by
himself
in
the
dark
under
the
tree
frances
went
to
him
there
i
wondered
whether
you
would
come
to
me
he
said
i
was
doing
something
for
michael
is
it
done
yes
it
done
five
months
passed
it
was
november
now
in
the
lane
by
the
side
door
anthony
was
waiting
in
his
car
rain
was
falling
hanging
from
the
trees
and
falling
every
now
and
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
had
still
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
need
start
but
he
was
not
going
back
into
the
house
they
were
all
in
there
saying
to
john
old
fleming
and
louie
and
emmeline
and
edith
and
maurice
and
his
brother
bartie
the
door
in
the
garden
wall
opened
and
they
came
out
the
four
women
in
black
the
black
they
still
wore
for
michael
and
the
two
men
they
all
walked
slowly
up
the
lane
anthony
could
see
bartie
shoulders
hunched
irritably
against
the
rain
he
could
see
morrie
carrying
his
sodden
quivering
body
with
care
and
an
exaggerated
sobriety
he
saw
grannie
going
slowly
under
the
umbrella
very
upright
and
conscious
of
herself
as
wonderful
and
outlasting
he
got
down
and
cranked
up
his
engine
then
he
sat
sternly
in
his
car
and
waited
with
his
hands
on
the
ready
the
engine
throbbed
impatient
for
the
start
john
came
out
very
quickly
and
took
his
seat
beside
his
father
and
the
car
went
slowly
towards
the
high
road
uncle
morrie
stood
waiting
for
it
by
the
gate
at
the
top
of
the
lane
as
it
passed
through
he
straightened
himself
and
put
up
his
hand
in
a
crapulous
salute
the
young
man
smiled
at
him
saluted
and
was
gone
