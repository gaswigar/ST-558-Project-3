good

exulted
the
cardinal
he
darted
through
the
orange
orchard
searching
for
slugs
for
his
breakfast
and
between
whiles
he
rocked
on
the
branches
and
rang
over
his
message
of
encouragement
to
men
the
song
of
the
cardinal
was
overflowing
with
joy
for
this
was
his
holiday
his
playtime
the
southern
world
was
filled
with
brilliant
sunshine
gaudy
flowers
an
abundance
of
fruit
myriads
of
insects
and
never
a
thing
to
do
except
to
bathe
feast
and
be
happy
no
wonder
his
song
was
a
prophecy
of
good
cheer
for
the
future
for
happiness
made
up
the
whole
of
his
past
the
cardinal
was
only
a
yearling
yet
his
crest
flared
high
his
beard
was
crisp
and
black
and
he
was
a
very
prodigy
in
size
and
colouring
fathers
of
his
family
that
had
accomplished
many
migrations
appeared
small
beside
him
and
coats
that
had
been
shed
season
after
season
seemed
dull
compared
with
his
it
was
as
if
a
pulsing
heart
of
flame
passed
by
when
he
came
winging
through
the
orchard
last
season
the
cardinal
had
pipped
his
shell
away
to
the
north
in
that
paradise
of
the
birds
the
limberlost
there
thousands
of
acres
of
black
stretch
under
summers
sun
and
winters
snows
there
are
darksome
pools
of
murky
water
bits
of
swale
and
high
morass
giants
of
the
forest
reach
skyward
or
coated
with
velvet
slime
lie
decaying
in
pools
while
the
underbrush
is
almost
impenetrable
the
swamp
resembles
a
big
for
the
birds
wild
clamber
to
the
tops
of
the
highest
trees
spreading
over
the
branches
and
their
festooned
floating
trailers
wave
as
silken
fringe
in
the
play
of
the
wind
the
birds
loll
in
the
shade
peel
bark
gather
dried
curlers
for
nest
material
and
feast
on
the
pungent
fruit
they
chatter
in
swarms
over
the
trees
and
overload
their
crops
with
red
haws
wild
plums
papaws
blackberries
and
mandrake
the
alders
around
the
edge
draw
flocks
in
search
of
berries
and
the
marsh
grasses
and
weeds
are
weighted
with
seed
hunters
the
muck
is
alive
with
worms
and
the
whole
swamp
ablaze
with
flowers
whose
colours
and
perfumes
attract
myriads
of
insects
and
butterflies
wild
creepers
flaunt
their
red
and
gold
from
the
treetops
and
the
bumblebees
and
make
common
cause
in
rifling
the
trumpets
the
air
around
the
and

trees
is
vibrant
with
the
beating
wings
of
millions
of
wild
bees
and
the
feast
to
gluttony

fetid
odours

the
swamp

leaps
from

everything
native
to

of

limberlost
but
above
all
the

dainty
green
warblers

in

the
home
of

there
are

constantly
and

from

and
with
the
tanagers

on

and
insects
in
the
evening
dart
on

wing
whippoorwills
set
up
a
plaintive
cry
that
they
continue
far
into
the
night
and

and
rich

robins
wake
the
echoes
of
each
new
day
with
the
admonition
cheer
up
cheer
up
and
a
little
later
big
black
vultures
go
wheeling
through
cloudland
or
hang
there
like
frozen
splashes
searching
the
limberlost
and
the
surrounding
country
for
food
the
boom
of
the
bittern
resounds
all
day
and
above
it
the
rasping
scream
of
the
blue
heron
as
he
strikes
terror
to
the
hearts
of
frogdom
while
the
occasional
cries
of
a
lost
loon
strayed
from
its
flock
in
northern
migration
fill
the
swamp
with
sounds
of
wailing
flashing
through
the
of
the
limberlost
there
are
birds
whose
colour
is
more
brilliant
than
that
of
the
gaudiest
flower
lifting
its
face
to
light
and
air
the
lilies
of
the
mire
are
not
so
white
as
the
white
herons
that
fish
among
them
the
ripest
spray
of
goldenrod
is
not
so
highly
coloured
as
the
burnished
gold
on
the
breast
of
the
oriole
that
rocks
on
it
the
jays
are
bluer
than
the
calamus
bed
they
wrangle
above
with
throaty
chatter
the
finches
are
a
finer
purple
than
the
ironwort
for
every
clump
of
foxfire
flaming
in
the
limberlost
there
is
a
cardinal
glowing
redder
on
a
bush
above
it
these
may
not
be
more
numerous
than
other
birds
but
their
brilliant
colouring
and
the
fearless
disposition
make
them
seem
so
the
cardinal
was
hatched
in
a
thicket
of
sweetbrier
and
blackberry
his
father
was
a
tough
old
widower
of
many
experiences
and
variable
temper
he
was
the
biggest
most
aggressive
redbird
in
the
limberlost
and
easily
reigned
king
of
his
kind
catbirds
and
shrikes
gave
him
a
wide
berth
and
not
even
the
jays
plucked
up
enough
courage
to
antagonize
him
a
few
days
after
his
latest
bereavement
he
saw
a
fine
plump
young
female
and
she
so
filled
his
eye
that
he
gave
her
no
rest
until
she
permitted
his
caresses
and
carried
the
first
twig
to
the
wild
rose
she
was
very
proud
to
mate
with
the
king
of
the
limberlost
and
if
deep
in
her
heart
she
felt
transient
fears
of
her
lordly
master
she
gave
no
sign
for
she
was
a
bird
of
goodly
proportion
and
fine
feather
herself
she
chose
her
location
with
the
eye
of
an
artist
and
the
judgment
of
a
nest
builder
of
more
experience
it
would
be
difficult
for
snakes
and
squirrels
to
penetrate
that
briery
thicket
the
white
berry
blossoms
scarcely
had
ceased
to
attract
a
swarm
of
insects
before
the
sweets
of
the
roses
recalled
them
by
the
time
they
had
faded
luscious
big
berries
ripened
within
reach
and
drew
food
hunters
she
built
with
far
more
than
ordinary
care
it
was
a
beautiful
nest
not
nearly
so
carelessly
made
as
those
of
her
kindred
all
through
the
swamp
there
was
a
distinct
attempt
at
a
cup
shape
and
it
really
was
neatly
lined
with
dried
blades
of
sweet
marsh
grass
but
it
was
in
the
laying
of
her
first
egg
that
the
queen
cardinal
forever
distinguished
herself
she
was
a
fine
healthy
bird
full
of
love
and
happiness
over
her
first
venture
in
and
she
so
far
surpassed
herself
on
that
occasion
she
had
difficulty
in
convincing
any
one
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
result
indeed
she
was
compelled
to
lift
beak
and
wing
against
her
mate
in
defense
of
this
egg
for
it
was
so
unusually
large
that
he
could
not
be
persuaded
short
of
force
that
some
sneak
of
the
feathered
tribe
had
not
slipped
in
and
deposited
it
in
her
absence
the
king
felt
sure
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
egg
and
wanted
to
roll
it
from
the
nest
but
the
queen
knew
her
own
and
stoutly
battled
for
its
protection
she
further
increased
their
prospects
by
laying
three
others
after
that
the
king
made
up
his
mind
that
she
was
a
most
remarkable
bird
and
went
away
but
the
queen
settled
to
brooding
a
picture
of
joyous
faith
and
contentment
through
all
the
long
days
when
the
heat
became
intense
and
the
king
was
none
too
thoughtful
of
her
appetite
or
comfort
she
nestled
those
four
eggs
against
her
breast
and
patiently
waited
the
big
egg
was
her
treasure
she
gave
it
constant
care
many
times
in
a
day
she
turned
it
and
always
against
her
breast
there
was
the
individual
pressure
that
distinguished
it
from
the
others
it
was
the
first
to
hatch
of
course
and
the
queen
felt
that
she
had
enough
if
all
the
others
failed
her
for
this
egg
pipped
with
a
resounding
pip
and
before
the
silky
down
was
really
dry
on
the
big
terracotta
body
the
young
cardinal
arose
and
lustily
demanded
food
the
king
came
to
see
him
and
at
once
acknowledged
subjugation
he
was
the
father
of
many
promising
cardinals
yet
he
never
had
seen
one
like
this
he
set
the
limberlost
echoes
rolling
with
his
jubilant
rejoicing
he
unceasingly
hunted
for
the
ripest
berries
and
seed
he
stuffed
that
baby
from
morning
until
night
and
never
came
with
food
that
he
did
not
find
him
standing
the
others
calling
for
more
the
queen
was
just
as
proud
of
him
and
quite
as
foolish
in
her
idolatry
but
she
kept
tally
and
gave
the
remainder
every
other
worm
in
turn
they
were
unusually
fine
babies
but
what
chance
has
merely
a
fine
baby
in
a
family
that
possesses
a
prodigy
the
cardinal
was
as
large
as
any
two
of
the
other
nestlings
and
so
red
the
very
down
on
him
seemed
tinged
with
crimson
his
skin
and
even
his
feet
were
red
he
was
the
first
to
climb
to
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
the
first
to
hop
on
a
limb
he
surprised
his
parents
by
finding
a
slug
and
winged
his
first
flight
to
such
a
distance
that
his
adoring
mother
almost
went
into
spasms
lest
his
strength
might
fail
and
he
would
fall
into
the
swamp
and
become
the
victim
of
a
hungry
old
turtle
he
returned
safely
however
and
the
king
was
so
pleased
he
hunted
him
an
unusually
ripe
berry
and
perching
before
him
gave
him
his
first
language
lesson
of
course
the
cardinal
knew
how
to
cry
pee
and
chee
when
he
burst
his
shell
but
the
king
taught
him
to
chip
with
accuracy
and
expression
and
he
learned
that
very
day
that
male
birds
of
the
cardinal
family
always
call
chip
and
the
females
chook
in
fact
he
learned
so
rapidly
and
was
generally
so
observant
that
before
the
king
thought
it
wise
to
give
the
next
lesson
he
found
him
on
a
limb
his
beak
closed
his
throat
swelling
practising
his
own
rendering
of
the
tribal
calls
wheat
wheat
wheat
here
here
here
and
cheer
cheer
cheer
this
so
delighted
the
king
that
he
whistled
them
over
and
over
and
helped
the
youngster
all
he
could
he
was
so
proud
of
him
that
this
same
night
he
gave
him
his
first
lesson
in
tucking
his
head
properly
and
going
to
sleep
alone
in
a
few
more
days
when
he
was
sure
of
his
wing
strength
he
gave
him
instructions
in
flying
he
taught
him
how
to
spread
his
wings
and
slowly
sail
from
tree
to
tree
how
to
fly
in
short
broken
curves
to
avoid
the
aim
of
a
hunter
how
to
turn
abruptly
in
air
and
make
a
quick
dash
after
a
bug
or
an
enemy
he
taught
him
the
proper
angle
at
which
to
breast
a
stiff
wind
and
that
he
always
should
meet
a
storm
head
first
so
that
the
water
would
run
as
the
plumage
lay
his
first
bathing
lesson
was
a
pronounced
success
the
cardinal
enjoyed
water
like
a
duck
he
bathed
splashed
and
romped
until
his
mother
was
almost
crazy
for
fear
he
would
attract
a
watersnake
or
turtle
but
the
element
of
fear
was
not
a
part
of
his
disposition
he
learned
to
dry
dress
and
plume
his
feathers
and
showed
such
remarkable
pride
in
keeping
himself
immaculate
that
although
only
a
youngster
he
was
already
a
bird
of
such
great
promise
that
many
of
the
feathered
inhabitants
of
the
limberlost
came
to
pay
him
a
call
next
the
king
took
him
on
a
long
trip
around
the
swamp
and
taught
him
to
select
the
proper
places
to
hunt
for
worms
how
to
search
under
leaves
for
and
slugs
for
meat
which
berries
were
good
and
safe
and
the
kind
of
weeds
that
bore
the
most
and
best
seeds
he
showed
him
how
to
find
tiny
pebbles
to
grind
his
food
and
how
to
sharpen
and
polish
his
beak
then
he
took
up
the
real
music
lessons
and
taught
him
how
to
whistle
and
how
to
warble
and
trill
good
cheer
good
cheer
intoned
the
king
coo
cher
coo
cher
imitated
the
cardinal
these
songs
were
only
studied
repetitions
but
there
was
a
depth
and
volume
in
his
voice
that
gave
promise
of
future
greatness
when
age
should
have
developed
him
and
experience
awakened
his
emotions
he
was
an
excellent
musician
for
a
youngster
he
soon
did
so
well
in
caring
for
himself
in
finding
food
and
in
flight
and
grew
so
big
and
independent
that
he
made
numerous
excursions
alone
through
the
limberlost
and
so
impressive
were
his
proportions
and
so
aggressive
his
manner
that
he
suffered
no
molestation
in
fact
the
reign
of
the
king
promised
to
end
speedily
but
if
he
feared
it
he
made
no
sign
and
his
pride
in
his
wonderful
offspring
was
always
manifest
after
the
cardinal
had
explored
the
swamp
thoroughly
a
longing
for
a
wider
range
grew
upon
him
and
day
after
day
he
lingered
around
the
borders
looking
across
the
wide
cultivated
fields
almost
aching
to
test
his
wings
in
one
long
high
wild
stretch
of
flight
a
day
came
when
the
heat
of
the
late
summer
set
the
marsh
steaming
and
the
cardinal
flying
close
to
the
borders
caught
the
breeze
from
the
upland
and
the
vision
of
broad
fields
stretching
toward
the
north
so
enticed
him
that
he
spread
his
wings
and
following
the
line
of
trees
and
fences
as
much
as
possible
he
made
his
first
journey
from
home
that
day
was
so
delightful
it
decided
his
fortunes
it
would
seem
that
the
swamp
so
appreciated
by
his
kindred
should
have
been
sufficient
for
the
cardinal
but
it
was
not
with
every
mile
he
winged
his
flight
came
a
greater
sense
of
power
and
strength
and
a
keener
love
for
the
broad
sweep
of
field
and
forest
his
heart
bounded
with
the
zest
of
rocking
on
the
wind
racing
through
the
sunshine
and
sailing
over
the
endless
panorama
of
waving
corn
fields
and
woodlands
the
heat
and
closeness
of
the
limberlost
seemed
a
prison
well
escaped
as
on
and
on
he
flew
in
straight
untiring
flight
crossing
a
field
of
corn
that
sloped
to
the
river
the
cardinal
saw
many
birds
feeding
there
so
he
alighted
on
a
tall
tree
to
watch
them
soon
he
decided
that
he
would
like
to
try
this
new
food
he
found
a
place
where
a
crow
had
left
an
ear
nicely
laid
open
and
clinging
to
the
husk
as
he
saw
the
others
do
he
stretched
to
his
full
height
and
drove
his
strong
sharp
beak
into
the
creamy
grain
after
the
stifling
swamp
hunting
after
the
long
exciting
flight
to
rock
on
this
swaying
corn
and
drink
the
rich
milk
of
the
grain
was
to
the
cardinal
his
first
taste
of
nectar
and
ambrosia
he
lifted
his
head
when
he
came
to
the
golden
kernel
and
chipping
it
in
tiny
specks
he
tasted
and
approved
with
all
the
delight
of
an
epicure
in
a
delicious
new
dish
perhaps
there
were
other
treats
in
the
next
field
he
decided
to
fly
even
farther
but
he
had
gone
only
a
short
distance
when
he
changed
his
course
and
turned
to
the
south
for
below
him
was
a
long
shining
creeping
thing
fringed
with
willows
while
towering
above
them
were
giant
sycamore
maple
tulip
and
elm
trees
that
caught
and
rocked
with
the
wind
and
the
cardinal
did
not
know
what
it
was
filled
with
wonder
he
dropped
lower
and
lower
birds
were
everywhere
many
flying
over
and
dipping
into
it
but
its
clear
creeping
silver
was
a
mystery
to
the
cardinal
the
beautiful
river
of
poetry
and
song
that
the
indians
first
discovered
and
later
with
the
french
named
ouabache
the
winding
shining
river
that
logan
and
loved
the
only
river
that
could
tempt
from
the
salamonie
and
mississinewa
the
river
beneath
whose
silver
sycamores
and
giant
maples
chief
godfrey
pitched
his
campfires
was
never
more
beautiful
than
on
that
perfect
autumn
day
with
his
feathers
pressed
closely
the
cardinal
alighted
on
a
willow
and
leaned
to
look
quivering
with
excitement
and
uttering
explosive
chips
for
there
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
big
redbird
that
appeared
neither
peaceful
nor
timid
he
uttered
an
impudent
chip
of
challenge
which
as
it
left
his
beak
was
flung
back
to
him
the
cardinal
flared
his
crest
and
half
lifted
his
wings
stiffening
them
at
the
butt
the
bird
he
was
facing
did
the
same
in
his
surprise
he
arose
to
his
full
height
with
a
dexterous
little
side
step
and
the
other
bird
straightened
and
exactly
with
him
this
was
too
insulting
for
the
cardinal
straining
every
muscle
he
made
a
dash
at
the
impudent
stranger
he
struck
the
water
with
such
force
that
it
splashed
above
the
willows
and
a
kingfisher
stationed
on
a
stump
opposite
him
watching
the
shoals
for
minnows
saw
it
he
spread
his
beak
and
rolled
forth
rattling
laughter
until
his
voice
reechoed
from
point
to
point
down
the
river
the
cardinal
scarcely
knew
how
he
got
out
but
he
had
learned
a
new
lesson
that
beautiful
shining
creeping
thing
was
water
not
thick
tepid
black
marsh
water
but
pure
cool
silver
water
he
shook
his
plumage
feeling
a
degree
redder
from
shame
but
he
would
not
be
laughed
into
leaving
he
found
it
too
delightful
in
a
short
time
he
ventured
down
and
took
a
sip
and
it
was
the
first
real
drink
of
his
life
oh
but
it
was
good
when
thirst
from
the
heat
and
his
long
flight
was
quenched
he
ventured
in
for
a
bath
and
that
was
a
new
and
delightful
experience
how
he
splashed
and
splashed
and
sent
the
silver
drops
flying
how
he
ducked
and
soaked
and
cooled
in
that
rippling
water
in
which
he
might
remain
as
long
as
he
pleased
and
splash
his
fill
for
he
could
see
the
bottom
for
a
long
distance
all
around
and
easily
could
avoid
anything
attempting
to
harm
him
he
was
so
wet
when
his
bath
was
finished
he
scarcely
could
reach
a
bush
to
dry
and
dress
his
plumage
once
again
in
perfect
feather
he
remembered
the
bird
of
the
water
and
returned
to
the
willow
there
in
the
depths
of
the
shining
river
the
cardinal
discovered
himself
and
his
heart
swelled
big
with
just
pride
was
that
broad
full
breast
his
where
had
he
seen
any
other
cardinal
with
a
crest
so
high
it
waved
in
the
wind
how
big
and
black
his
eyes
were
and
his
beard
was
almost
as
long
and
crisp
as
his
father
he
spread
his
wings
and
gloated
on
their
sweep
and
twisted
and
flirted
his
tail
he
went
over
his
toilet
again
and
dressed
every
feather
on
him
he
scoured
the
back
of
his
neck
with
the
butt
of
his
wings
and
tucking
his
head
under
them
slowly
drew
it
out
time
after
time
to
polish
his
crest
he
turned
and
twisted
he
rocked
and
paraded
and
every
glimpse
he
caught
of
his
size
and
beauty
filled
him
with
pride
he
strutted
like
a
peacock
and
chattered
like
a
jay
when
he
could
find
no
further
points
to
admire
something
else
caught
his
attention
when
he
chipped
there
was
an
answering
chip
across
the
river
certainly
there
was
no
cardinal
there
so
it
must
be
that
he
was
hearing
his
own
voice
as
well
as
seeing
himself
selecting
a
conspicuous
perch
he
sent
an
incisive
chip
across
the
water
and
in
kind
it
came
back
to
him
then
he
chipped
softly
and
tenderly
as
he
did
in
the
limberlost
to
a
favourite
little
sister
who
often
came
and
perched
beside
him
in
the
maple
where
he
slept
and
softly
and
tenderly
came
the
answer
then
the
cardinal
understood
wheat
wheat
wheat
he
whistled
it
high
and
he
whistled
it
low
cheer
cheer
cheer
he
whistled
it
tenderly
and
sharply
and
imperiously
here
here
here
at
this
ringing
command
every
bird
as
far
as
the
river
carried
his
voice
came
to
investigate
and
remained
to
admire
over
and
over
he
rang
every
change
he
could
invent
he
made
a
gallant
effort
at
warbling
and
trilling
and
then
with
the
gladdest
heart
he
ever
had
known
he
burst
into
ringing
song
good
cheer
good
cheer
good
cheer
as
evening
came
on
he
grew
restless
and
uneasy
so
he
slowly
winged
his
way
back
to
the
limberlost
but
that
day
forever
spoiled
him
for
a
swamp
bird
in
the
night
he
restlessly
ruffled
his
feathers
and
sniffed
for
the
breeze
of
the
meadows
he
tasted
the
corn
and
the
clear
water
again
he
admired
his
image
in
the
river
and
longed
for
the
sound
of
his
voice
until
he
began
murmuring
wheat
wheat
wheat
in
his
sleep
in
the
earliest
dawn
a
robin
awoke
him
singing
cheer
up
cheer
up
and
he
answered
with
a
sleepy
cheer
cheer
cheer
later
the
robin
sang
again
with
exquisite
softness
and
tenderness
cheer
up
dearie
cheer
up
dearie
cheer
up
cheer
up
cheer
the
cardinal
now
fully
awakened
shouted
lustily
good
cheer
good
cheer
and
after
that
it
was
only
a
short
time
until
he
was
on
his
way
toward
the
shining
river
it
was
better
than
before
and
every
following
day
found
him
feasting
in
the
corn
field
and
bathing
in
the
shining
water
but
he
always
returned
to
his
family
at
nightfall
when
black
frosts
began
to
strip
the
limberlost
and
food
was
almost
reduced
to
dry
seed
there
came
a
day
on
which
the
king
marshalled
his
followers
and
gave
the
magic
signal
with
dusk
he
led
them
southward
mile
after
mile
until
their
breath
fell
short
and
their
wings
ached
with
unaccustomed
flight
but
because
of
the
trips
to
the
river
the
cardinal
was
stronger
than
the
others
and
he
easily
kept
abreast
of
the
king
in
the
early
morning
even
before
the
robins
were
awake
the
king
settled
in
the
everglades
but
the
cardinal
had
lost
all
liking
for
swamp
life
so
he
stubbornly
set
out
alone
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
found
another
river
it
was
not
quite
so
delightful
as
the
shining
river
but
still
it
was
beautiful
and
on
its
gently
sloping
bank
was
an
orange
orchard
there
the
cardinal
rested
and
found
a
winter
home
after
his
heart
desire
the
following
morning
a
little
girl
and
an
old
man
with
snowy
locks
came
hand
in
hand
through
the
orchard
the
child
saw
the
redbird
and
immediately
claimed
him
and
that
same
day
the
edict
went
forth
that
a
very
dreadful
time
was
in
store
for
any
one
who
harmed
or
even
frightened
the
cardinal
so
in
security
began
a
series
of
days
that
were
pure
delight
the
orchard
was
alive
with
insects
attracted
by
the
heavy
odours
and
slugs
infested
the
bark
feasting
was
almost
as
good
as
in
the
limberlost
and
always
there
was
the
river
to
drink
from
and
to
splash
in
at
will
in
those
days
the
child
and
the
old
man
lingered
for
hours
in
the
orchard
watching
the
bird
that
every
day
seemed
to
grow
bigger
and
brighter
what
a
picture
his
coat
now
a
bright
cardinal
red
made
against
the
waxy
green
leaves
how
big
and
brilliant
he
seemed
as
he
raced
and
darted
in
play
among
the
creamy
blossoms
how
the
little
girl
stood
with
clasped
hands
worshipping
him
as
with
swelling
throat
he
rocked
on
the
highest
spray
and
sang
his
inspiring
chorus
over
and
over
good
cheer
good
cheer
every
day
they
came
to
watch
and
listen
they
scattered
crumbs
and
the
cardinal
grew
so
friendly
that
he
greeted
their
coming
with
a
quick
chip
chip
while
the
delighted
child
tried
to
repeat
it
after
him
soon
they
became
such
friends
that
when
he
saw
them
approaching
he
would
call
softly
chip
chip
and
then
with
beady
eyes
and
tilted
head
await
her
reply
sometimes
a
member
of
his
family
from
the
everglades
found
his
way
into
the
orchard
and
the
cardinal
having
grown
to
feel
a
sense
of
proprietorship
resented
the
intrusion
and
pursued
him
like
a
streak
of
flame
whenever
any
straggler
had
this
experience
he
returned
to
the
swamp
realizing
that
the
cardinal
of
the
orange
orchard
was
almost
twice
his
size
and
strength
and
so
startlingly
red
as
to
be
a
wonder
one
day
a
gentle
breeze
from
the
north
sprang
up
and
stirred
the
orange
branches
wafting
the
heavy
perfume
across
the
land
and
out
to
sea
and
spread
in
its
stead
a
cool
delicate
pungent
odour
the
cardinal
lifted
his
head
and
whistled
an
inquiring
note
he
was
not
certain
and
went
on
searching
for
slugs
and
predicting
happiness
in
full
round
notes
good
cheer
good
cheer
again
the
odour
swept
the
orchard
so
strong
that
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
it
the
cardinal
darted
to
the
topmost
branch
his
crest
flaring
his
tail
twitching
nervously
chip
chip
he
cried
with
excited
insistence
chip
chip
the
breeze
was
coming
stiffly
and
steadily
now
unlike
anything
the
cardinal
ever
had
known
for
its
cool
breath
told
of
fields
breaking
up
under
the
sun
its
damp
touch
was
from
the
spring
showers
washing
the
face
of
the
northland
its
subtle
odour
was
the
commingling
of
myriads
of
unfolding
leaves
and
crisp
plants
upspringing
its
pungent
perfume
was
the
pollen
of
catkins
up
in
the
land
of
the
limberlost
old
mother
nature
with
strident
muttering
had
set
about
her
annual
house
cleaning
with
her
efficient
broom
the
march
wind
she
was
sweeping
every
nook
and
cranny
clean
with
her
overflowing
with
april
showers
she
was
washing
the
face
of
all
creation
and
if
these
measures
failed
to
produce
cleanliness
to
her
satisfaction
she
gave
a
final
polish
with
storms
of
hail
the
shining
river
was
filled
to
overflowing
breaking
up
the
ice
and
carrying
a
load
of
refuse
it
went
rolling
to
the
sea
the
ice
and
snow
had
not
altogether
gone
but
the
earth
was
mothering
her
children
she
cringed
at
every
step
for
the
ground
was
teeming
with
life
bug
and
worm
were
working
to
light
and
warmth
thrusting
aside
the
mold
and
leaves
above
them
spring
beauties
hepaticas
and
violets
lifted
tender
heads
the
sap
was
flowing
and
leafless
trees
were
covered
with
swelling
buds
delicate
mosses
were
creeping
over
every
stick
of
decaying
timber
the
lichens
on
stone
and
fence
were
freshly
painted
in
unending
shades
of
gray
and
green
myriads
of
flowers
and
vines
were
springing
up
to
cover
last
decaying
leaves
the
beautiful
uncut
hair
of
graves
was
creeping
over
meadow
spreading
beside
roadways
and
blanketing
every
naked
spot
the
limberlost
was
waking
to
life
even
ahead
of
the
fields
and
the
river
through
the
winter
it
had
been
the
barest
and
dreariest
of
places
but
now
the
earliest
signs
of
returning
spring
were
in
its
martial
music
for
when
the
green
hyla
pipes
and
the
bullfrog
drums
the
bird
voices
soon
join
them
the
catkins
bloomed
first
and
then
in
an
incredibly
short
time
flags
rushes
and
vines
were
like
a
sea
of
waving
green
and
swelling
buds
were
ready
to
burst
in
the
upland
the
smoke
was
curling
over
and
clearing
in
the
forests
animals
were
rousing
from
their
long
sleep
the
shad
were
starting
anew
their
journey
up
the
shining
river
peeps
of
green
were
mantling
hilltop
and
valley
and
the
northland
was
ready
for
its
dearest
springtime
treasures
to
come
home
again
from
overhead
were
ringing
those
first
glad
notes
caught
nearer
the
throne
than
those
of
any
other
bird
spring
o
year
spring
o
year
while
little
killdeers
were
scudding
around
the
limberlost
and
beside
the
river
flinging
from
cloudland
their
kill
deer
kill
deer
call
the
robins
in
the
orchards
were
pulling
the
long
dried
blades
of
last
year
grass
from
beneath
the
snow
to
line
their
cups
and
the
bluebirds
were
at
the
hollow
apple
tree
flat
on
the
top
rail
the
doves
were
gathering
their
few
coarse
sticks
and
twigs
together
it
was
such
a
splendid
place
to
set
their
cradle
the
weatherbeaten
rotting
old
rails
were
the
very
colour
of
the
busy
dove
mother
her
eye
fitted
into
the
background
like
a
tiny
scarlet
lichen
cup
surely
no
one
would
ever
see
her
the
limberlost
and
shining
river
the
fields
and
forests
the
wayside
bushes
and
fences
the
stumps
logs
hollow
trees
even
the
bare
brown
breast
of
mother
earth
were
all
waiting
to
cradle
their
own
again
and
by
one
of
the
untold
miracles
each
would
return
to
its
place
there
was
intoxication
in
the
air
the
subtle
pungent
ravishing
odours
on
the
wind
of
unfolding
leaves
washed
plants
and
catkin
pollen
were
an
elixir
to
humanity
the
cattle
of
the
field
were
fairly
drunk
with
it
and
herds
during
the
winter
were
coming
to
their
first
grazing
with
heads
thrown
high
romping
bellowing
and
racing
like
wild
things
the
north
wind
sweeping
from
icy
fastnesses
caught
this
odour
of
spring
and
carried
it
to
the
orange
orchards
and
everglades
and
at
a
breath
of
it
crazed
with
excitement
the
cardinal
went
flaming
through
the
orchard
for
with
no
one
to
teach
him
he
knew
what
it
meant
the
call
had
come
holidays
were
over
it
was
time
to
go
home
time
to
riot
in
crisp
freshness
time
to
go
courting
time
to
make
love
time
to
possess
his
own
time
for
mating
and
all
that
day
he
flashed
around
nervous
with
dread
of
the
unknown
and
palpitant
with
delightful
expectation
but
with
the
coming
of
dusk
he
began
his
journey
northward
when
he
passed
the
everglades
he
winged
his
way
slowly
and
repeatedly
sent
down
a
challenging
chip
but
there
was
no
answer
then
the
cardinal
knew
that
the
north
wind
had
carried
a
true
message
for
the
king
and
his
followers
were
ahead
of
him
on
their
way
to
the
limberlost
mile
after
mile
a
thing
of
pulsing
fire
he
breasted
the
night
and
it
was
not
so
very
long
until
he
could
discern
a
flickering
patch
of
darkness
sweeping
the
sky
before
him
the
cardinal
flew
steadily
in
a
straight
sweep
until
with
a
throb
of
triumph
in
his
heart
he
arose
in
his
course
and
from
far
overhead
flung
down
a
boastful
challenge
to
the
king
and
his
followers
as
he
sailed
above
them
and
was
lost
from
sight
it
was
still
dusky
with
the
darkness
of
night
when
he
crossed
the
limberlost
dropping
low
enough
to
see
its
branches
laid
bare
to
catch
a
gleam
of
green
in
its
swelling
buds
and
to
hear
the
wavering
chorus
of
its
frogs
but
there
was
no
hesitation
in
his
flight
straight
and
sure
he
winged
his
way
toward
the
shining
river
and
it
was
only
a
few
more
miles
until
the
rolling
waters
of
its
springtime
flood
caught
his
eye
dropping
precipitately
he
plunged
his
burning
beak
into
the
loved
water
then
he
flew
into
a
fine
old
stag
sumac
and
tucked
his
head
under
his
wing
for
a
short
rest
he
had
made
the
long
flight
in
one
unbroken
sweep
and
he
was
sleepy
in
utter
content
he
ruffled
his
feathers
and
closed
his
eyes
for
he
was
beside
the
shining
river
and
it
would
be
another
season
before
the
orange
orchard
would
ring
again
with
his
good
cheer
good
cheer
chapter
wet
year
wet
year
prophesied
the
cardinal
the
sumac
seemed
to
fill
his
idea
of
a
perfect
location
from
the
very
first
he
perched
on
a
limb
and
between
dressing
his
plumage
and
pecking
at
last
year
sour
dried
berries
he
sent
abroad
his
prediction
old
mother
nature
verified
his
wisdom
by
sending
a
dashing
shower
but
he
cared
not
at
all
for
a
wetting
he
knew
how
to
turn
his
crimson
suit
into
the
most
perfect
of
coats
so
he
flattened
his
crest
sleeked
his
feathers
and
breasting
the
april
downpour
kept
on
calling
for
rain
he
knew
he
would
appear
brighter
when
it
was
past
and
he
seemed
to
know
too
that
every
day
of
sunshine
and
shower
would
bring
nearer
his
heart
desire
he
was
a
very
beau
brummel
while
he
waited
from
morning
until
night
he
bathed
dressed
his
feathers
sunned
himself
fluffed
and
flirted
he
strutted
and
chipped
incessantly
he
claimed
that
sumac
for
his
very
own
and
stoutly
battled
for
possession
with
many
intruders
it
grew
on
a
densely
wooded
slope
and
the
shining
river
went
singing
between
grassy
banks
whitened
with
spring
beauties
below
it
crowded
around
it
were
thickets
of
papaw
wild
thorn
dogwood
and
red
haw
that
attracted
bug
and
insect
and
just
across
the
old
snake
fence
was
a
field
of
mellow
mould
sloping
to
the
river
that
soon
would
be
plowed
for
corn
turning
out
numberless
big
fat
grubs
he
was
compelled
almost
hourly
to
wage
battles
for
his
location
for
there
was
something
fine
about
the
old
stag
sumac
that
attracted
homestead
seekers
a
sober
pair
of
robins
began
laying
their
foundations
there
the
morning
the
cardinal
arrived
and
a
couple
of
blackbirds
tried
to
take
possession
before
the
day
had
passed
he
had
little
trouble
with
the
robins
they
were
easily
conquered
and
with
small
protest
settled
a
rod
up
the
bank
in
a
tree
but
the
air
was
thick
with
chips
chatter
and
red
and
black
feathers
before
the
blackbirds
acknowledged
defeat
they
were
and
knew
about
the
grubs
and
the
young
corn
but
they
also
knew
when
they
were
beaten
so
they
moved
down
stream
to
a
scrub
oak
trying
to
assure
each
other
that
it
was
the
place
they
really
had
wanted
from
the
first
the
cardinal
was
left
boasting
and
strutting
in
the
sumac
but
in
his
heart
he
found
it
lonesome
business
being
the
son
of
a
king
he
was
much
too
dignified
to
beg
for
a
mate
and
besides
it
took
all
his
time
to
guard
the
sumac
but
his
eyes
were
wide
open
to
all
that
went
on
around
him
and
he
envied
the
blackbird
his
glossy
devoted
little
sweetheart
with
all
his
might
he
almost
strained
his
voice
trying
to
rival
the
of
a
skylark
that
hung
among
the
clouds
above
a
meadow
across
the
river
and
poured
down
to
his
mate
a
story
of
adoring
love
and
sympathy
he
screamed
a
chip
of
such
savage
jealousy
at
a
pair
of
killdeer
lovers
that
he
sent
them
scampering
down
the
river
bank
without
knowing
that
the
crime
of
which
they
stood
convicted
was
that
of
being
mated
when
he
was
not
as
for
the
doves
that
were
already
brooding
on
the
line
fence
beneath
the
maples
the
cardinal
was
torn
between
two
opinions
he
was
alone
he
was
and
he
was
holding
the
finest
building
location
beside
the
shining
river
for
his
mate
and
her
slowness
in
coming
made
their
devotion
difficult
to
endure
when
he
coveted
a
true
love
but
it
seemed
to
the
cardinal
that
he
never
could
so
forget
himself
as
to
emulate
the
example
of
that
dove
lover
the
dove
had
no
dignity
he
was
so
effusive
he
was
a
nuisance
he
kept
his
dignified
quaker
mate
stuffed
to
discomfort
he
clung
to
the
side
of
the
nest
trying
to
help
brood
until
he
almost
crowded
her
from
the
eggs
he
pestered
her
with
caresses
and
cooed
over
his
until
every
chipmunk
on
the
line
fence
was
familiar
with
his
story
the
temper
was
worn
to
such
a
fine
edge
that
he
darted
at
the
dove
one
day
and
pulled
a
big
tuft
of
feathers
from
his
back
when
he
had
returned
to
the
sumac
he
was
compelled
to
admit
that
his
anger
lay
quite
as
much
in
that
he
had
no
one
to
love
as
because
the
dove
was
disgustingly
devoted
every
morning
brought
new
arrivals
trim
young
females
fresh
from
their
long
holiday
and
big
boastful
males
appearing
their
brightest
and
bravest
each
singer
almost
splitting
his
throat
in
the
effort
to
captivate
the
mate
he
coveted
they
came
flashing
down
the
river
bank
like
rockets
of
scarlet
gold
blue
and
black
rocking
on
the
willows
splashing
in
the
water
bursting
into
jets
of
melody
making
every
possible
display
of
their
beauty
and
music
and
at
times
fighting
fiercely
when
they
discovered
that
the
females
they
were
wooing
favoured
their
rivals
and
desired
only
to
be
friendly
with
them
the
heart
of
the
cardinal
sank
as
he
watched
there
was
not
a
member
of
his
immediate
family
among
them
he
pitied
himself
as
he
wondered
if
fate
had
in
store
for
him
the
trials
he
saw
others
suffering
those
dreadful
feathered
females
how
they
coquetted
how
they
flirted
how
they
sleeked
and
flattened
their
plumage
and
with
beaks
and
sparkling
eyes
hopped
closer
and
closer
as
if
charmed
the
eager
singers
with
swelling
throats
sang
and
sang
in
a
very
frenzy
of
extravagant
pleading
but
just
when
they
felt
sure
their
little
loves
were
on
the
point
of
surrender
a
rod
distant
above
the
bushes
would
go
streaks
of
feathers
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
endure
the
bitter
disappointment
follow
them
and
begin
all
over
for
the
last
three
days
the
cardinal
had
been
watching
his
cousin
grosbeak
make
violent
love
to
the
most
exquisite
little
female
who
apparently
encouraged
his
advances
only
to
see
him
left
sitting
as
blue
and
disconsolate
as
any
human
lover
when
he
discovers
that
the
maid
who
has
coquetted
with
him
for
a
season
belongs
to
another
man
the
cardinal
flew
to
the
very
top
of
the
highest
sycamore
and
looked
across
country
toward
the
limberlost
should
he
go
there
seeking
a
swamp
mate
among
his
kindred
it
was
not
an
endurable
thought
to
be
sure
matters
were
becoming
serious
no
bird
beside
the
shining
river
had
plumed
paraded
or
made
more
music
than
he
was
it
all
to
be
wasted
by
this
time
he
confidently
had
expected
results
only
that
morning
he
had
swelled
with
pride
as
he
heard
jay
tell
her
quarrelsome
husband
that
she
wished
she
could
exchange
him
for
the
cardinal
did
not
the
gentle
dove
pause
by
the
sumac
when
she
left
brooding
to
take
her
morning
dip
in
the
dust
and
gaze
at
him
with
unconcealed
admiration
no
doubt
she
devoutly
wished
her
plain
pudgy
husband
wore
a
scarlet
coat
but
it
is
praise
from
one
own
sex
that
is
praise
indeed
and
only
an
hour
ago
the
lark
had
reported
that
from
his
lookout
above
cloud
he
saw
no
other
singer
anywhere
so
splendid
as
the
cardinal
of
the
sumac
because
of
these
things
he
held
fast
to
his
conviction
that
he
was
a
prince
indeed
and
he
decided
to
remain
in
his
chosen
location
and
with
his
physical
and
vocal
attractions
compel
the
finest
little
cardinal
in
the
fields
to
seek
him
he
planned
it
all
very
carefully
how
she
would
hear
his
splendid
music
and
come
to
take
a
peep
at
him
how
she
would
be
captivated
by
his
size
and
beauty
how
she
would
come
timidly
but
come
of
course
for
his
approval
how
he
would
condescend
to
accept
her
if
she
pleased
him
in
all
particulars
how
she
would
be
devoted
to
him
and
how
she
would
approve
his
choice
of
a
home
for
the
sumac
was
in
a
lovely
spot
for
scenery
as
well
as
for
several
days
he
had
boasted
he
had
bantered
he
had
challenged
he
had
on
this
last
day
almost
condescended
to
coaxing
but
not
one
little
cardinal
female
had
come
to
offer
herself
the
performance
of
a
brown
thrush
drove
him
wild
with
envy
the
thrush
came
gliding
up
the
river
bank
a
sneaking
thing
of
the
underbrush
and
taking
possession
of
a
thorn
bush
just
opposite
the
sumac
he
sang
for
an
hour
in
the
open
there
was
no
way
to
improve
that
music
it
was
woven
fresh
from
the
warp
and
woof
of
his
fancy
it
was
a
song
so
filled
with
the
joy
and
gladness
of
spring
notes
so
thrilled
with
love
pleading
and
passion
tender
pulsing
pain
that
at
its
close
there
were
a
admiring
thrush
females
gathered
around
with
care
and
deliberation
the
brown
thrush
selected
the
most
attractive
and
she
followed
him
to
the
thicket
as
if
charmed
it
was
the
cardinal
dream
materialized
for
another
before
his
very
eyes
and
it
filled
him
with
envy
if
that
plain
brown
bird
that
slinked
as
if
he
had
a
theft
to
account
for
could
by
showing
himself
and
singing
for
an
hour
win
a
mate
why
should
not
he
the
most
gorgeous
bird
of
the
woods
openly
flaunting
his
charms
and
discoursing
his
music
have
at
least
equal
success
should
he
the
proudest
most
magnificent
of
cardinals
be
compelled
to
go
seeking
a
mate
like
any
common
bird
perish
the
thought
he
went
to
the
river
to
bathe
after
finding
a
spot
where
the
water
flowed
over
a
bed
of
white
limestone
he
washed
until
he
felt
that
he
could
be
no
cleaner
then
the
cardinal
went
to
his
favourite
and
stretching
on
a
limb
he
stood
his
feathers
on
end
and
sunned
fluffed
and
prinked
until
he
was
immaculate
on
the
antler
of
the
old
stag
sumac
he
perched
and
strained
until
his
jetty
whiskers
appeared
stubby
he
poured
out
a
tumultuous
cry
vibrant
with
every
passion
raging
in
him
he
caught
up
his
own
rolling
echoes
and
changed
and
varied
them
he
improvised
and
set
the
shining
river
ringing
wet
year
wet
year
he
whistled
and
whistled
until
all
birdland
and
even
mankind
heard
for
the
farmer
paused
at
his
kitchen
door
with
his
pails
of
foaming
milk
and
called
to
his
wife
hear
that
maria

as
abram
opened
the
door
wet
year
wet

pealed
the
flaming
prophet
he
went
out
closing
the
door
softly
and
with
an
utter
disregard
for
the
corn
field
made
a
bee
line
for
the
musician
i
do
know
as
this
is
the
best
for
twinges
o
rheumatiz
he
muttered
as
he
turned
up
his
collar
and
drew
his
old
hat
lower
to
keep
the
splashing
drops
from
his
face
i
do
jest
rightly

i
free

dead
as

i
get
a
call
an
the
fact
is
i
called
down
beside

river
wet
year
wet

rolled
the
cardinal

abram
went
peering
and
dodging
beside
the
fence
peeping
into
the
bushes
searching
for
the
bird
suddenly
there
was
a
whir
of
wings
and
a
streak
of
crimson
scared
you
into
the
next
county
i
he
muttered
but
it
came
nearer
being
a
scared
man
than
a
frightened
bird
for
the
cardinal
flashed
straight
toward
him
until
only
a
few
yards
away
and
then
swaying
on
a
bush
it
chipped
cheered
peeked
whistled
broken
notes
and
manifested
perfect
delight
at
the
sight
of
the
old
man
abram
stared
in
astonishment
lord
he
gasped
big
as
a
blackbird

so
by
gum
leaning
toward
abram
the
cardinal
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
peered
chipped
and
waited
for
an
answering
chip
from
a
little
child
but
there
was
no
way
for
the
man
to
know
that

abram
lifted

on

squared

reputation

a
mighty
quiet
fellow

you
abram
straightened
and
touched
his
hat
brim
in
a
trim
half
military
salute
well
redbird
never
had
more
pleasure
anybody
in
my
life
first
time
i
met
maria
you
think
about
the
plowin
an
if
you
say
it
a
go
an
do
be
a
little
more
careful
o
yourself
see
you
in
the
mornin
right
after
breakfast
no
count
taken
o
the
weather
wet
year
wet
year
called
the
cardinal
after
his
retreating
figure
abram
turned
and
gravely
saluted
the
second
time
the
cardinal
went
to
the
top
rail
and
feasted
on
the
sweet
grains
of
corn
until
his
craw
was
full
and
then
nestled
in
the
sumac
and
went
to
sleep
early
next
morning
he
was
abroad
and
in
fine
toilet
and
with
a
full
voice
from
the
top
of
the
sumac
greeted
the
day
wet
year
wet
year
far
down
the
river
echoed
his
voice
until
it
so
closely
resembled
some
member
of
his
family
replying
that
he
followed
searching
the
banks
mile
after
mile
on
either
side
until
finally
he
heard
voices
of
his
kind
he
located
them
but
it
was
only
several
staid
old
couples
a
long
time
mated
and
busy
with
their
the
cardinal
returned
to
the
sumac
feeling
a
degree
lonelier
than
ever
he
decided
to
prospect
in
the
opposite
direction
and
taking
wing
he
started
up
the
river
following
the
channel
he
winged
his
flight
for
miles
over
the
cool
sparkling
water
between
the
tangle
of
foliage
bordering
the
banks
when
he
came
to
the
long
cumbrous
structures
of
wood
with
which
men
had
bridged
the
river
where
the
shuffling
feet
of
tired
farm
horses
raised
clouds
of
dust
and
set
the
echoes
rolling
with
their
thunderous
hoof
beats
he
was
afraid
and
rising
high
he
sailed
over
them
in
short
broken
curves
of
flight
but
where
giant
maple
and
ash
leaning
locked
branches
across
the
channel
in
one
of
old
mother
nature
bridges
for
the
squirrels
he
knew
no
fear
and
dipped
so
low
beneath
them
that
his
image
trailed
a
wavering
shadow
on
the
silver
path
he
followed
he
rounded
curve
after
curve
and
frequently
stopping
on
a
conspicuous
perch
flung
a
ringing
challenge
in
the
face
of
the
morning
with
every
mile
the
way
he
followed
grew
more
beautiful
the
river
bed
was
limestone
and
the
swiftly
flowing
water
clear
and
limpid
the
banks
were
precipitate
in
some
places
gently
sloping
in
others
and
always
crowded
with
a
tangle
of
foliage
at
an
abrupt
curve
in
the
river
he
mounted
to
the
summit
of
a
big
ash
and
made
boastful
prophecy
wet
year
wet
year
and
on
all
sides
there
sprang
up
the
voices
of
his
kind
startled
the
cardinal
took
wing
he
followed
the
river
in
a
circling
flight
until
he
remembered
that
here
might
be
the
opportunity
to
win
the
coveted
river
mate
and
going
slower
to
select
the
highest
branch
on
which
to
display
his
charms
he
discovered
that
he
was
only
a
few
yards
from
the
ash
from
which
he
had
made
his
prediction
the
cardinal
flew
over
the
narrow
neck
and
sent
another
call
then
without
awaiting
a
reply
again
he
flashed
up
the
river
and
circled
horseshoe
bend
when
he
came
to
the
same
ash
for
the
third
time
he
understood
the
river
circled
in
one
great
curve
the
cardinal
mounted
to
the
limb
of
the
ash
and
looked
around
him
there
was
never
a
fairer
sight
for
the
eye
of
man
or
bird
the
mist
and
shimmer
of
early
spring
were
in
the
air
the
wabash
rounded
horseshoe
bend
in
a
silver
circle
rimmed
by
a
tangle
of
foliage
bordering
both
its
banks
and
inside
lay
a
low
open
space
covered
with
waving
marsh
grass
and
the
blue
bloom
of
sweet
calamus
scattered
around
were
mighty
trees
but
conspicuous
above
any
in
the
very
center
was
a
giant
sycamore
split
at
its
base
into
three
large
trees
whose
waving
branches
seemed
to
sweep
the
face
of
heaven
and
whose
roots
like
miserly
fingers
clutched
deep
into
the
black
muck
of
rainbow
bottom
it
was
in
this
lovely
spot
that
the
rainbow
at
last
materialized
and
at
its
base
free
to
all
humanity
who
cared
to
seek
the
great
alchemist
had
left
his
rarest
treasures
the
gold
of
sunshine
diamond
emerald
foliage
and
sapphire
sky
for
good
measure
there
were
added
seeds
berries
and
insects
for
the
birds
and
wild
flowers
fruit
and
nuts
for
the
children
above
all
the
sycamore
waved
its
majestic
head
it
made
a
throne
that
seemed
suitable
for
the
son
of
the
king
and
mounting
to
its
topmost
branch
for
miles
the
river
carried
his
challenge
ho
cardinals
look
this
way
behold
me
have
you
seen
any
other
of
so
great
size
have
you
any
to
equal
my
grace
who
can
whistle
so
loud
so
clear
so
compelling
a
note
who
will
fly
to
me
for
protection
who
will
come
and
be
my
mate
he
flared
his
crest
high
swelled
his
throat
with
rolling
notes
and
appeared
so
big
and
brilliant
that
among
the
many
cardinals
that
had
gathered
to
hear
there
was
not
one
to
compare
with
him
black
envy
filled
their
hearts
who
was
this
flaming
dashing
stranger
flaunting
himself
in
the
faces
of
their
females
there
were
many
unmated
cardinals
in
rainbow
bottom
and
many
jealous
males
a
second
time
the
cardinal
rocking
and
flashing
proclaimed
himself
and
there
was
a
note
of
feminine
approval
so
strong
that
he
caught
it
tilting
on
a
twig
his
crest
flared
to
full
height
his
throat
swelled
to
bursting
his
heart
too
big
for
his
body
the
cardinal
shouted
his
challenge
for
the
third
time
when
clear
and
sharp
arose
a
cry
in
answer
here
here
here
it
came
from
a
female
that
had
accepted
the
caresses
of
the
brightest
cardinal
in
rainbow
bottom
only
the
day
before
and
had
spent
the
morning
carrying
twigs
to
a
thicket
of
red
haws
the
cardinal
with
a
royal
flourish
sprang
in
air
to
seek
her
but
her
outraged
mate
was
ahead
of
him
and
with
a
scream
she
fled
leaving
a
tuft
of
feathers
in
her
mate
beak
in
turn
the
cardinal
struck
him
like
a
flashing
rocket
and
then
red
war
waged
in
rainbow
bottom
the
females
scattered
for
cover
with
all
their
might
the
cardinal
worked
in
a
kiss
on
one
poor
little
bird
too
frightened
to
escape
him
then
the
males
closed
in
and
serious
business
began
the
cardinal
would
have
enjoyed
a
fight
vastly
with
two
or
three
opponents
but
a
made
discretion
better
than
valour
he
darted
among
them
scattering
them
right
and
left
and
made
for
the
sycamore
with
all
his
remaining
breath
he
insolently
repeated
his
challenge
and
then
headed
down
stream
for
the
sumac
with
what
grace
he
could
command
there
was
an
hour
of
angry
recrimination
before
sweet
peace
brooded
again
in
rainbow
bottom
the
newly
mated
pair
finally
made
up
the
females
speedily
resumed
their
coquetting
and
forgot
the
captivating
stranger
all
save
the
poor
little
one
that
had
been
kissed
by
accident
she
never
had
been
kissed
before
and
never
had
expected
that
she
would
be
for
she
was
a
creature
of
many
misfortunes
of
every
nature
she
had
been
hatched
from
a
fifth
egg
to
begin
with
and
every
one
knows
the
disadvantage
of
beginning
life
with
four
sturdy
older
birds
on
top
of
one
it
was
a
meager
egg
and
a
feeble
baby
that
pipped
its
shell
the
remainder
of
the
family
stood
and
took
nearly
all
the
food
so
that
she
almost
starved
in
the
nest
and
she
never
really
knew
the
luxury
of
a
hearty
meal
until
her
elders
had
flown
that
lasted
only
a
few
days
for
the
others
went
then
and
their
parents
followed
them
so
far
afield
that
the
poor
little
soul
clamouring
alone
in
the
nest
almost
perished
she
climbed
to
the
edge
and
exercised
her
wings
until
she
managed
some
sort
of
flight
to
a
neighbouring
bush
she
missed
the
twig
and
fell
to
the
ground
where
she
lay
cold
and
shivering
she
cried
pitifully
and
was
almost
dead
when
a
barefoot
boy
with
a
on
his
shoulder
passed
and
heard
her
poor
little
thing
you
are
almost
dead
he
said
i
know
what
do
with
you
i
take
you
over
and
set
you
in
the
bushes
where
i
heard
those
other
redbirds
and
then
your
ma
will
feed
you
the
boy
turned
back
and
carefully
set
her
on
a
limb
close
to
one
of
her
brothers
and
there
she
got
just
enough
food
to
keep
her
alive
so
her
troubles
continued
once
a
squirrel
chased
her
and
she
saved
herself
by
crowding
into
a
hole
so
small
her
pursuer
could
not
follow
the
only
reason
she
escaped
a
big
blue
racer
when
she
went
to
take
her
first
bath
was
that
a
hawk
had
his
eye
on
the
snake
and
snapped
it
up
at
just
the
proper
moment
to
save
the
poor
quivering
little
bird
she
was
left
so
badly
frightened
that
she
could
not
move
for
a
long
time
all
the
tribulations
of
birdland
fell
to
her
lot
she
was
so
frail
and
weak
she
lost
her
family
in
migration
and
followed
with
some
strangers
that
were
none
too
kind
life
in
the
south
had
been
full
of
trouble
once
a
bullet
grazed
her
so
closely
she
lost
two
of
her
wing
quills
and
that
made
her
more
timid
than
ever
coming
north
she
had
given
out
again
and
finally
had
wandered
into
rainbow
bottom
lost
and
alone
she
was
such
a
shy
fearsome
little
body
the
females
all
flouted
her
and
the
males
never
seemed
to
notice
that
there
was
material
in
her
for
a
very
fine
mate
every
other
female
cardinal
in
rainbow
bottom
had
several
males
courting
her
but
this
poor
frightened
lonely
one
had
never
a
suitor
and
she
needed
love
so
badly
now
she
had
been
kissed
by
this
magnificent
stranger
of
course
she
knew
it
really
was
not
her
kiss
he
had
intended
it
for
the
bold
creature
that
had
answered
his
challenge
but
since
it
came
to
her
it
was
hers
in
a
way
after
all
she
hid
in
the
underbrush
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
was
never
so
frightened
in
all
her
life
she
brooded
over
it
constantly
and
morning
found
her
at
the
down
curve
of
the
horseshoe
straining
her
ears
for
the
rarest
note
she
ever
had
heard
all
day
she
hid
and
waited
and
the
following
days
were
filled
with
longing
but
he
never
came
again
so
one
morning
possessed
with
courage
she
did
not
understand
and
filled
with
longing
that
drove
her
against
her
will
she
started
down
the
river
for
miles
she
sneaked
through
the
underbrush
and
watched
and
listened
until
at
last
night
came
and
she
returned
to
rainbow
bottom
the
next
morning
she
set
out
early
and
flew
to
the
spot
from
which
she
had
turned
back
the
night
before
from
there
she
glided
through
the
bushes
and
underbrush
trembling
and
quaking
yet
pushing
stoutly
onward
straining
her
ears
for
some
note
of
the
brilliant
stranger
it
was
when
she
reached
the
region
of
the
sumac
and
as
she
hopped
warily
along
only
a
short
distance
from
her
full
and
splendid
there
burst
the
voice
of
the
singer
for
whom
she
was
searching
she
sprang
into
air
and
fled
a
mile
before
she
realized
that
she
was
flying
then
she
stopped
and
listened
and
rolling
with
the
river
she
heard
those
bold
true
tones
close
to
earth
she
went
back
again
to
see
if
unobserved
she
could
find
a
spot
where
she
might
watch
the
stranger
that
had
kissed
her
when
at
last
she
reached
a
place
where
she
could
see
him
plainly
his
beauty
was
so
bewildering
and
his
song
so
enticing
that
she
gradually
hopped
closer
and
closer
without
knowing
she
was
moving
high
in
the
sumac
the
cardinal
had
sung
until
his
throat
was
parched
and
the
fountain
of
hope
was
almost
dry
there
was
nothing
save
defeat
from
overwhelming
numbers
in
rainbow
bottom
he
had
paraded
and
made
all
the
music
he
ever
had
been
taught
and
improvised
much
more
yet
no
one
had
come
to
seek
him
was
it
of
necessity
to
be
the
limberlost
then
this
one
day
more
he
would
retain
his
dignity
and
his
location
he
tipped
tilted
and
flirted
he
whistled
and
sang
and
trilled
over
the
lowland
and
up
and
down
the
shining
river
ringing
in
every
change
he
could
invent
he
sent
for
the
last
time
his
prophetic
message
wet
year
wet
year
chapter
come
here
come
here
entreated
the
cardinal
he
felt
that
his
music
was
not
reaching
his
standard
as
he
burst
into
this
new
song
he
was
almost
discouraged
no
way
seemed
open
to
him
but
flight
to
the
limberlost
and
he
so
disdained
the
swamp
that
would
lose
something
of
its
greatest
charm
if
he
were
driven
there
for
a
mate
the
time
seemed
ripe
for
stringent
measures
and
the
cardinal
was
ready
to
take
them
but
how
could
he
stringently
urge
a
little
mate
that
would
not
come
on
his
imploring
invitations
he
listlessly
pecked
at
the
berries
and
flung
abroad
an
inquiring
chip
with
just
an
atom
of
hope
he
frequently
mounted
to
his
and
issued
an
order
that
savoured
far
more
of
a
plea
come
here
come
here
and
then
leaning
he
listened
intently
to
the
voice
of
the
river
lest
he
fail
to
catch
the
faintest
responsive
chook
it
might
bear
he
could
hear
the
sniffling
of
carp
wallowing
beside
the
bank
a
big
pickerel
slashed
around
breakfasting
on
minnows
opposite
the
sumac
the
black
bass
with
gamy
spring
snapped
up
before
it
struck
the
water
every
luckless
insect
that
fell
from
the
feast
of
sweets
in
a
wild
crab
the
sharp
bark
of
the
red
squirrel
and
the
low
of
cattle
lazily
chewing
their
cuds
among
the
willows
came
to
him
the
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
on
a
dead
sycamore
a
little
above
him
rolled
to
his
straining
ears
like
a
drum
beat
the
cardinal
hated
the
woodpecker
more
than
he
disliked
the
dove
it
was
only
foolishly
effusive
but
the
woodpecker
was
a
veritable
bluebeard
the
cardinal
longed
to
pull
the
feathers
from
his
back
until
it
was
as
red
as
his
head
for
the
woodpecker
had
dressed
his
suit
in
finest
style
and
with
dulcet
tones
and
melting
tenderness
had
gone
acourting
sweet
as
the
dove
had
been
his
wooing
and
one
more
pang
the
lonely
cardinal
had
suffered
at
being
forced
to
witness
his
felicity
yet
scarcely
had
his
plump
amiable
little
mate
consented
to
his
caresses
and
approved
the
sycamore
before
he
turned
on
her
pecked
her
severely
and
pulled
a
tuft
of
plumage
from
her
breast
there
was
not
the
least
excuse
for
this
tyrannical
action
and
the
sight
filled
the
cardinal
with
rage
he
fully
expected
to
see
madam
woodpecker
divorce
herself
and
flee
her
new
home
and
he
most
earnestly
hoped
that
she
would
but
she
did
no
such
thing
she
meekly
flattened
her
feathers
hurried
work
in
a
lively
manner
and
tried
in
every
way
to
anticipate
and
avert
her
mate
displeasure
under
this
treatment
he
grew
more
abusive
and
now
madam
woodpecker
dodged
every
time
she
came
within
his
reach
it
made
the
cardinal
feel
so
vengeful
that
he
longed
to
go
up
and
drum
the
sycamore
with
the
woodpecker
head
until
he
taught
him
how
to
treat
his
mate
properly
there
was
plently
of
lark
music
rolling
with
the
river
and
that
morning
brought
the
first
liquid
golden
notes
of
the
orioles
they
had
arrived
at
dawn
and
were
overjoyed
with
their
homecoming
for
they
were
darting
from
bank
to
bank
singing
exquisitely
on
wing
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
bird
voices
that
floated
with
the
river
and
yet
there
was
no
beginning
to
the
one
voice
for
which
the
cardinal
waited
with
passionate
longing
the
oriole
singing
was
so
inspiring
that
it
tempted
the
cardinal
to
another
effort
and
perching
where
he
gleamed
crimson
and
black
against
the
april
sky
he
tested
his
voice
and
when
sure
of
his
tones
he
entreatingly
called
come
here
come
here
just
then
he
saw
her
she
came
daintily
over
the
earth
soft
as
down
before
the
wind
a
rosy
flush
suffusing
her
plumage
a
coral
beak
her
very
feet
pink
the
shyest
most
timid
little
thing
alive
her
bright
eyes
were
popping
with
fear
and
down
there
among
the
ferns
anemones
and
last
year
dried
leaves
she
tilted
her
sleek
crested
head
and
peered
at
him
with
frightened
wonder
and
silent
helplessness
it
was
for
this
the
cardinal
had
waited
hoped
and
planned
for
many
days
he
had
rehearsed
what
he
conceived
to
be
every
point
of
the
situation
and
yet
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
thing
that
suddenly
happened
to
him
he
had
expected
to
reject
many
applicants
before
he
selected
one
to
match
his
charms
but
instantly
this
shy
little
creature
slipping
along
near
earth
taking
a
surreptitious
peep
at
him
made
him
feel
a
very
small
bird
and
he
certainly
never
before
had
felt
small
the
crushing
possibility
that
somewhere
there
might
be
a
cardinal
that
was
larger
brighter
and
a
finer
musician
than
he
staggered
him
and
worst
of
all
his
voice
broke
suddenly
to
his
complete
embarrassment
half
screened
by
the
flowers
she
seemed
so
little
so
shy
so
delightfully
sweet
he
chipped
carefully
once
or
twice
to
steady
himself
and
clear
his
throat
for
unaccountably
it
had
grown
dry
and
husky
and
then
he
tenderly
tried
again
come
here
come
here
implored
the
cardinal
he
forgot
all
about
his
dignity
he
knew
that
his
voice
was
trembling
with
eagerness
and
hoarse
with
fear
he
was
afraid
to
attempt
approaching
her
but
he
leaned
toward
her
begging
and
pleading
he
teased
and
insisted
and
he
did
not
care
a
particle
if
he
did
it
suddenly
seemed
an
honour
to
coax
her
he
rocked
on
the
limb
he
and
hopped
and
gyrated
gracefully
he
fluffed
and
flirted
and
showed
himself
to
every
advantage
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
the
dove
and
the
woodpecker
might
be
watching
though
he
would
not
have
cared
in
the
least
if
they
had
been
and
as
for
any
other
cardinal
he
would
have
attacked
the
combined
forces
of
the
limberlost
and
rainbow
bottom
he
sang
and
sang
every
impulse
of
passion
in
his
big
crimson
palpitating
body
was
thrown
into
those
notes
but
she
only
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
peering
at
him
seeming
sufficiently
frightened
to
flee
at
a
breath
and
answered
not
even
the
faintest
little
chook
of
encouragement
the
cardinal
rested
a
second
before
he
tried
again
that
steadied
him
and
gave
him
better
command
of
himself
he
could
tell
that
his
notes
were
clearing
and
growing
sweeter
he
was
improving
perhaps
she
was
interested
there
was
some
encouragement
in
the
fact
that
she
was
still
there
the
cardinal
felt
that
his
time
had
come
come
here
come
here
he
was
on
his
mettle
now
surely
no
cardinal
could
sing
fuller
clearer
sweeter
notes
he
began
at
the
very
first
and
rollicked
through
a
story
of
adventure
colouring
it
with
every
wild
dashing
catchy
note
he
could
improvise
he
followed
that
with
a
rippling
song
of
the
joy
and
fulness
of
spring
in
notes
as
light
and
airy
as
the
soul
of
melody
and
with
swaying
body
kept
time
to
his
rhythmic
measures
then
he
glided
into
a
song
of
love
and
tenderly
pleadingly
passionately
told
the
story
as
only
a
courting
bird
can
tell
it
then
he
sang
a
song
of
ravishment
a
song
quavering
with
fear
and
the
pain
tugging
at
his
heart
he
almost
had
run
the
gamut
and
she
really
appeared
as
if
she
intended
to
flee
rather
than
to
come
to
him
he
was
afraid
to
take
even
one
timid
little
hop
toward
her
in
a
fit
of
desperation
the
cardinal
burst
into
the
passion
song
he
arose
to
his
full
height
leaned
toward
her
with
outspread
quivering
wings
and
crest
flared
to
the
utmost
and
rocking
from
side
to
side
in
the
intensity
of
his
fervour
he
poured
out
a
perfect
torrent
of
palpitant
song
his
cardinal
body
swayed
to
the
rolling
flood
of
his
ecstatic
tones
until
he
appeared
like
a
flaming
pulsing
note
of
materialized
music
as
he
entreated
coaxed
commanded
and
pled
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
threw
up
his
head
to
round
off
the
last
note
he
could
utter
and
breathlessly
glancing
down
to
see
if
she
were
coming
caught
sight
of
a
faint
streak
of
gray
in
the
distance
he
had
planned
so
to
subdue
the
little
female
he
courted
that
she
would
come
to
him
he
was
in
hot
pursuit
a
half
day
journey
away
before
he
remembered
it
no
other
cardinal
ever
endured
such
a
chase
as
she
led
him
in
the
following
days
through
fear
and
timidity
she
had
kept
most
of
her
life
in
the
underbrush
the
cardinal
was
a
bird
of
the
open
fields
and
he
loved
to
rock
with
the
wind
and
speed
in
great
plunges
of
flight
this
darting
and
twisting
over
logs
among
leaves
and
through
tangled
thickets
tired
tried
and
exasperated
him
more
than
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
flight
sometimes
he
drove
her
from
cover
and
then
she
wildly
dashed
and
seeking
another
thicket
but
wherever
she
went
the
cardinal
was
only
a
breath
behind
her
and
with
every
passing
mile
his
passion
for
her
grew
there
was
no
time
to
eat
bathe
or
sing
only
mile
after
mile
of
unceasing
pursuit
it
seemed
that
the
little
creature
could
not
stop
if
she
would
and
as
for
the
cardinal
he
was
in
that
chase
to
remain
until
his
last
it
was
a
question
how
the
frightened
bird
kept
in
advance
she
was
visibly
the
worse
for
this
ardent
courtship
two
tail
feathers
were
gone
and
there
was
a
broken
one
beating
from
her
wing
once
she
had
flown
too
low
striking
her
head
against
a
rail
until
a
drop
of
blood
came
and
she
cried
pitifully
several
times
the
cardinal
had
cornered
her
and
tried
to
hold
her
by
a
bunch
of
feathers
and
compel
her
by
force
to
listen
to
reason
but
she
only
broke
from
his
hold
and
dashed
away
a
stricken
thing
leaving
him
half
dead
with
longing
and
remorse
but
no
matter
how
baffled
she
grew
or
where
she
fled
in
her
headlong
flight
the
one
thing
she
always
remembered
was
not
to
lead
the
cardinal
into
the
punishment
that
awaited
him
in
rainbow
bottom
panting
for
breath
quivering
with
fear
longing
for
retreats
worn
and
half
blinded
by
the
disasters
of
flight
through
strange
country
the
tired
bird
beat
her
aimless
way
but
she
would
have
been
torn
to
pieces
before
she
would
have
led
her
magnificent
pursuer
into
the
wrath
of
his
enemies
poor
little
feathered
creature
she
had
been
fleeing
some
kind
of
danger
all
her
life
she
could
not
realize
that
love
and
protection
had
come
in
this
splendid
guise
and
she
fled
on
and
on
once
the
cardinal
aching
with
passion
and
love
fell
behind
that
she
might
rest
and
before
he
realized
that
another
bird
was
close
an
impudent
big
relative
of
his
straying
from
the
limberlost
entered
the
race
and
pursued
her
so
hotly
that
with
a
note
of
utter
panic
she
wheeled
and
darted
back
to
the
cardinal
for
protection
when
to
the
rush
of
rage
that
possessed
him
at
the
sight
of
a
rival
was
added
the
knowledge
that
she
was
seeking
him
in
her
extremity
such
a
mighty
wave
of
anger
swept
the
cardinal
that
he
appeared
twice
his
real
size
like
a
flaming
brand
of
vengeance
he
struck
that
limberlost
upstart
and
sent
him
rolling
to
earth
a
mass
of
battered
feathers
with
beak
and
claw
he
made
his
attack
and
when
he
so
utterly
demolished
his
rival
that
he
hopped
away
trembling
with
dishevelled
plumage
stained
with
his
own
blood
the
cardinal
remembered
his
little
love
and
hastened
back
confidently
hoping
for
his
reward
she
was
so
securely
hidden
that
although
he
went
searching
calling
pleading
he
found
no
trace
of
her
the
remainder
of
that
day
the
cardinal
almost
went
distracted
and
his
tender
imploring
cries
would
have
moved
any
except
a
bird
he
did
not
even
know
in
what
direction
to
pursue
her
night
closed
down
and
found
him
in
a
fever
of
fear
but
it
brought
rest
and
wisdom
she
could
not
have
gone
very
far
she
was
too
worn
he
would
not
proclaim
his
presence
soon
she
would
suffer
past
enduring
for
food
and
water
he
hid
in
the
willows
close
where
he
had
lost
her
and
waited
with
what
patience
he
could
and
it
was
a
wise
plan
shortly
after
dawn
moving
stilly
as
the
break
of
day
trembling
with
fear
she
came
slipping
to
the
river
for
a
drink
it
was
almost
brutal
cruelty
but
her
fear
must
be
overcome
someway
and
with
a
cry
of
triumph
the
cardinal
in
a
plunge
of
flight
was
beside
her
she
gave
him
one
stricken
look
and
dashed
away
the
chase
began
once
more
and
continued
until
she
was
visibly
breaking
there
was
no
room
for
a
rival
that
morning
the
cardinal
flew
abreast
of
her
and
gave
her
a
caress
or
attempted
a
kiss
whenever
he
found
the
slightest
chance
she
was
almost
worn
out
her
flights
were
wavering
and
growing
shorter
the
cardinal
did
his
utmost
if
she
paused
to
rest
he
crept
close
as
he
dared
and
piteously
begged
come
here
come
here
when
she
took
wing
he
so
dexterously
intercepted
her
course
that
several
time
she
found
refuge
in
his
sumac
without
realizing
where
she
was
when
she
did
that
he
perched
just
as
closely
as
he
dared
and
while
they
both
rested
he
sang
to
her
a
soft
little
whispered
love
song
deep
in
his
throat
and
with
every
note
he
gently
edged
nearer
she
turned
her
head
from
him
and
although
she
was
panting
for
breath
and
palpitant
with
fear
the
cardinal
knew
that
he
dared
not
go
closer
or
she
would
dash
away
like
the
wild
thing
she
was
the
next
time
she
took
wing
she
found
him
so
persistently
in
her
course
that
she
turned
sharply
and
fled
panting
to
the
sumac
when
this
had
happened
so
often
that
she
seemed
to
recognize
the
sumac
as
a
place
of
refuge
the
cardinal
slipped
aside
and
spent
all
his
remaining
breath
in
an
exultant
whistle
of
triumph
for
now
he
was
beginning
to
see
his
way
he
dashed
into
and
with
a
gyration
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
flycatcher
he
snapped
up
a
gadfly
that
should
have
been
more
alert
with
a
tender
chip
from
branch
to
branch
slowly
cautiously
he
came
with
it
because
he
was
half
starved
himself
he
knew
that
she
must
be
almost
famished
holding
it
where
she
could
see
he
hopped
toward
her
eagerly
carefully
the
gadfly
in
his
beak
his
heart
in
his
mouth
he
stretched
his
neck
and
legs
to
the
limit
as
he
reached
the
fly
toward
her
what
matter
that
she
took
it
with
a
snap
and
plunged
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
eating
it
she
had
taken
food
from
him
that
was
the
beginning
cautiously
he
impelled
her
toward
the
sumac
and
with
untiring
patience
kept
her
there
the
remainder
of
the
day
he
carried
her
every
choice
morsel
he
could
find
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
sumac
and
occasionally
she
took
a
bit
from
his
beak
though
oftenest
he
was
compelled
to
lay
it
on
a
limb
beside
her
at
dusk
she
repeatedly
dashed
toward
the
underbrush
but
the
cardinal
with
endless
patience
and
tenderness
maneuvered
her
to
the
sumac
until
she
gave
up
and
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
neighbouring
grapevine
perched
on
a
limb
that
was
the
cardinal
own
chosen
tucked
her
tired
head
beneath
her
wing
and
went
to
rest
when
she
was
soundly
sleeping
the
cardinal
crept
as
closely
as
he
dared
and
with
one
eye
on
his
little
gray
love
and
the
other
roving
for
any
possible
danger
he
spent
a
night
of
watching
for
any
danger
that
might
approach
he
was
almost
worn
out
but
this
was
infinitely
better
than
the
previous
night
at
any
rate
for
now
he
not
only
knew
where
she
was
but
she
was
fast
asleep
in
his
own
favourite
place
huddled
on
the
limb
the
cardinal
gloated
over
her
he
found
her
beauty
perfect
to
be
sure
she
was
dishevelled
but
she
could
make
her
toilet
there
were
a
few
feathers
gone
but
they
would
grow
speedily
she
made
a
picture
on
which
the
cardinal
feasted
his
soul
by
the
light
of
every
straying
moonbeam
that
slid
around
the
edges
of
the
grape
leaves
wave
after
wave
of
tender
passion
shook
him
in
his
throat
half
the
night
he
kept
softly
calling
to
her
come
here
come
here
next
morning
when
the
robins
announced
day
beside
the
shining
river
she
awoke
with
a
start
but
before
she
could
decide
in
which
direction
to
fly
she
discovered
a
nice
fresh
grub
laid
on
the
limb
close
to
her
and
very
sensibly
remained
for
breakfast
then
the
cardinal
went
to
the
river
and
bathed
he
made
such
delightful
play
of
it
and
the
splash
of
the
water
sounded
so
refreshing
to
the
tired
draggled
bird
that
she
could
not
resist
venturing
for
a
few
dips
when
she
was
wet
she
could
not
fly
well
and
he
improved
the
opportunity
to
pull
her
broken
quills
help
her
dress
herself
and
bestow
a
few
extra
caresses
he
guided
her
to
his
favourite
place
for
a
sun
bath
and
followed
the
farmer
plow
in
the
corn
field
until
he
found
a
big
sweet
beetle
he
snapped
off
its
head
peeled
the
stiff
wing
shields
and
daintily
offered
it
to
her
he
was
so
delighted
when
she
took
it
from
his
beak
and
remained
in
the
sumac
to
eat
it
that
he
established
himself
on
an
adjoining
where
the
snowy
blossoms
of
a
wild
made
a
fine
background
for
his
scarlet
coat
he
sang
the
old
pleading
song
as
he
never
had
sung
it
before
for
now
there
was
a
tinge
of
hope
battling
with
the
fear
in
his
heart
over
and
over
he
sang
rounding
fulling
swelling
every
note
leaning
toward
her
in
coaxing
tenderness
flashing
his
brilliant
beauty
as
he
swayed
and
rocked
for
her
approval
and
all
that
he
had
suffered
and
all
that
he
hoped
for
was
in
his
song
just
when
his
heart
was
growing
sick
within
him
his
straining
ear
caught
the
faintest
most
timid
call
a
lover
ever
answered
only
one
imploring
gentle
chook
from
the
sumac
his
song
broke
in
a
suffocating
burst
of
exultation
cautiously
he
hopped
from
twig
to
twig
toward
her
with
tender
throaty
murmurings
he
slowly
edged
nearer
and
wonder
of
wonders
with
tired
eyes
and
quivering
wings
she
reached
him
her
beak
for
a
kiss
at
dinner
that
day
the
farmer
said
to
his
wife
maria

you
want

whole
endurin
country

maria
said
nothing
more
but
she
mentally
decided
she
had
no
time
to
fool
with
a
bird
when
there
were
housekeeping
and
spring
sewing
to
do
as
she
recalled
abram
enthusiastic
praise
of
the
singer
and
had
a
whiff
of
the
air
as
she
passed
from
kitchen
to
she
was
compelled
to
admit
that
it
was
a
temptation
to
go
but
she
finished
her
noon
work
and
resolutely
sat
down
with
her
needle
she
stitched
industriously
her
thread
straightening
with
a
quick
nervous
sweep
learned
through
years
of
experience
and
if
her
eyes
wandered
riverward
and
if
she
paused
frequently
with
arrested
hand
and
listened
intently
she
did
not
realize
it
by
two
a
spirit
of
unrest
that
demanded
recognition
had
taken
possession
of
her
setting
her
lips
firmly
a
scowl
clouding
her
brow
she
stitched
on
by
half
past
two
her
hands
dropped
in
her
lap
abram
new
hickory
shirt
slid
to
the
floor
and
she
hesitatingly
arose
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
closet
from
which
she
took
her
overshoes
and
set
them
by
the
kitchen
fire
to
have
them
ready
in
case
she
wanted
them
pshaw
she
muttered
i
got
this
shirt
to
finish
this
afternoon
there
butter
an
bakin
in
the
mornin
an
mary
jane
simms
is
for
a
visit
in
the
afternoon
she
returned
to
the
window
and
took
up
the
shirt
sewing
with
unusual
swiftness
for
the
next
but
by
three
she
dropped
it
and
opening
the
kitchen
door
gazed
toward
the
river
every
intoxicating
delight
of
early
spring
was
in
the
air
the
breeze
that
fanned
her
cheek
was
laden
with
subtle
perfume
of
pollen
and
the
crisp
fresh
odour
of
unfolding
leaves
curling
skyward
like
a
beckoning
finger
went
a
spiral
of
violet
and
gray
smoke
from
the
log
heap
abram
was
burning
and
scattered
over
spaces
of
a
mile
were
half
a
dozen
others
telling
a
story
of
the
activity
of
his
neighbours
like
the
low
murmur
of
distant
music
came
the
beating
wings
of
hundreds
of
her
bees
rimming
the
water
trough
insane
with
thirst
on
the
the
guinea
cock
clattered
incessantly
phut
rack
phut
rack
across
the
dooryard
came
the
old
with
fan
tail
and
a
rasping
scrape
of
wing
evincing
his
delight
in
spring
and
mating
time
by
a
series
of
explosive
snorts
on
the
barnyard
gate
the
old
shanghai
was
lustily
challenging
to
mortal
combat
one
of
his
kind
three
miles
across
country
from
the
river
arose
the
strident
scream
of
her
blue
gander
jealously
guarding
his
harem
in
the
the
hens
made
a
noisy
cackling
party
and
the
stable
lot
was
filled
with
cattle
bellowing
for
the
freedom
of
the
meadow
pasture
as
yet
scarcely
ready
for
grazing
it
seemed
to
the
little
woman
hesitating
in
the
doorway
as
if
all
nature
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
to
lure
her
from
her
work
and
just
then
clear
and
imperious
arose
the
demand
of
the
cardinal
come
here
come
here
blank
amazement
filled
her
face
as
i
a
livin
woman
she
gasped
he
changed
his
song
that
what
abram
meant
by
me
bein
invited
he
askin
folks
to
see
his
mate
i
goin
the
dull
red
of
excitement
sprang
into
her
cheeks
she
hurried
on
her
overshoes
and
drew
an
old
shawl
over
her
head
she
crossed
the
dooryard
followed
the
path
through
the
orchard
and
came
to
the
lane
below
the
barn
she
turned
back
and
attempted
to
cross
the
mud
was
deep
and
thick
and
she
lost
an
overshoe
but
with
the
help
of
a
stick
she
pried
it
out
and
replaced
it
joke
on
me
if
i
over
in
this
mud
she
muttered
she
entered
the
barn
and
came
out
a
minute
later
carefully
closing
and
buttoning
the
door
and
started
down
the
line
fence
toward
the
river
across
the
field
abram
saw
her
coming
no
need
to
recount
how
often
he
had
looked
in
that
direction
during
the
afternoon
he
slapped
the
lines
on
the
old
gray
back
and
came
tearing
down
the
slope
his
eyes
flashing
his
cheeks
red
his
hands
firmly
gripping
the
plow
that
rolled
up
a
line
of
black
mould
as
he
passed
maria
staring
at
his
flushed
face
and
shining
eyes
recognized
that
his
whole
being
proclaimed
an
inward
exultation
abram
johnson
she
solemnly
demanded
have
you
got
the
power
yes
cried
abram
pulling
off
his
old
felt
hat
and
gazing
into
the
crown
as
if
for
inspiration
you
said
it
honey
i
got
the
power
got
it
of
a
little
red
bird
power
o
spring
power
o
song
power
love
if
that
poor
little
red
target
for
some
ornery
cuss
bullet
can
get
all
he
getting
out
o
life
there
no
cause
why
a
reasonin
thinkin
man
should
realize
some
o
his
blessings
you
hit
it
maria
i
got
the
power
it
the
power
o
god
but
i
learned
how
to
lay
hold
of
it
from
that
little
red
bird
come
here
maria
abram
wrapped
the
lines
around
the
plow
handle
and
cautiously
led
his
wife
to
the
fence
he
found
a
piece
of
thick
bark
for
her
to
stand
on
and
placed
her
where
she
would
be
screened
by
a
big
oak
then
he
stood
behind
her
and
pointed
out
the
sumac
and
the
female
bird
jest
you
keep
still
a
minute
an
you
feel
paid
for
comin
all
right
honey
he
whispered
but
do
make
any
sudden
movement
i
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
a
specimen
she
is
answered
maria
she
looks
to
him
there
no
kick
comin
on
his
part
i
can
tell
you
replied
abram
the
bride
hopped
shyly
through
the
sumac
she
pecked
at
the
dried
berries
and
frequently
tried
to
improve
her
plumage
which
certainly
had
been
badly
draggled
and
there
was
a
drop
of
blood
dried
at
the
base
of
her
beak
she
plainly
showed
the
effects
of
her
rough
experience
and
yet
she
was
a
most
attractive
bird
for
the
dimples
in
her
plump
body
showed
through
the
feathers
and
instead
of
the
usual
wickedly
black
eyes
of
the
cardinal
family
hers
were
a
soft
tender
brown
touched
by
a
there
was
no
mistaking
she
was
a
beautiful
bird
and
she
was
doing
all
in
her
power
to
make
herself
dainty
again
her
movements
clearly
indicated
how
timid
she
was
and
yet
she
remained
in
the
sumac
as
if
she
feared
to
leave
it
and
frequently
peered
expectantly
among
the
there
was
a
burst
of
exultation
down
the
river
the
little
bird
gave
her
plumage
a
fluff
and
watched
anxiously
on
came
the
cardinal
like
a
flaming
rocket
calling
to
her
on
wing
he
alighted
beside
her
dropped
into
her
beak
a
morsel
of
food
gave
her
a
kiss
to
aid
digestion
caressingly
ran
his
beak
the
length
of
her
wing
quills
and
flew
to
the
dogwood
cardinal
enjoyed
the
meal
it
struck
her
palate
exactly
right
she
liked
the
kiss
and
caress
cared
in
fact
for
all
that
he
did
for
her
and
with
the
appreciation
of
his
tenderness
came
repentance
for
the
dreadful
chase
she
had
led
him
in
her
foolish
fright
and
an
impulse
to
repay
she
took
a
dainty
hop
toward
the
dogwood
and
the
invitation
she
sent
him
was
exquisite
with
a
shrill
whistle
of
exultant
triumph
the
cardinal
answered
at
a
headlong
rush
the
farmer
grip
tightened
on
his
wife
shoulder
but
maria
turned
toward
him
with
blazing
eyes

common
human
bein
an
i
do
know
where
you
got
privilege
to
spy
on
a
female
when
she
doin
the
best
she
knows
maria
broke
from
his
grasp
and
started
down
the
line
fence
in
a
few
strides
abram
had
her
in
his
arms
his
withered
cheek
with
its
springtime
bloom
pressed
against
her
equally
withered
one
maria
he
whispered
waveringly
maria

i
was
meanin
any
disrespect
to
the
sex
maria
wiped
her
eyes
on
the
corner
of
her
shawl
i

abram
she
admitted
but

on
with
your
plowin
an
let
that
little
female
alone
she
unclasped
his
arms
and
turned
homeward
honey

abram
softly
since

that
pocketful
wheat

as
well
let
me
have
it
landy
exclaimed
maria
blushing
i
plumb

early

scarce

carryin

pettin

i
knowed
for
a
week
said
abram
as
he
knelt
and
cupped
his
shrunken
hands
while
maria
guided
the
wheat
from
her
apron
into
them
i
scatter
it
along
the
top
rail
an
they
be
after
it
in
fifteen
minutes
thank
you
maria
was
good
o
you
to
think
of
it
maria
watched
him
steadily
how
dear
he
was
how
dear
he
always
had
been
how
happy
they
were
together
abram
she
asked
hesitatingly
is
there
anything
else
i
could
do
for
your
birds
they
were
creatures
of
habitual
repression
and
the
inner
glimpses
they
had
taken
of
each
other
that
day
were
surprises
they
scarcely
knew
how
to
meet
abram
said
nothing
because
he
could
not
he
slowly
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
the
plow
his
eyes
misty
maria
started
toward
the
line
fence
but
she
paused
repeatedly
to
listen
and
it
was
no
wonder
for
all
the
redbirds
from
miles
down
the
river
had
gathered
around
the
sumac
to
see
if
there
were
a
battle
in
birdland
but
it
was
only
the
cardinal
turning
somersaults
in
the
air
and
screaming
with
bursting
exuberance
come
here
come
here
chapter
so
dear
so
dear
crooned
the
cardinal
she
had
taken
possession
of
the
sumac
the
location
was
her
selection
and
he
loudly
applauded
her
choice
she
placed
the
first
twig
and
after
examining
it
carefully
he
spent
the
day
carrying
her
others
just
as
much
alike
as
possible
if
she
used
a
dried
grass
blade
he
carried
grass
blades
until
she
began
dropping
them
on
the
ground
if
she
worked
in
a
bit
of
wild
bark
he
peeled
until
she
would
have
no
more
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
the
largest
cardinal
in
the
woods
in
those
days
and
he
had
forgotten
that
he
wore
a
red
coat
she
was
not
a
skilled
architect
her
nest
certainly
was
a
loose
ramshackle
affair
but
she
had
built
it
and
had
allowed
him
to
help
her
it
was
hers
and
he
improvised
a
paean
in
its
praise
every
morning
he
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
nest
and
gazed
in
songless
wonder
at
each
beautiful
new
egg
and
whenever
she
came
to
brood
she
sat
as
if
entranced
eyeing
her
treasures
in
an
ecstasy
of
proud
possession
then
she
nestled
them
against
her
warm
breast
and
turned
adoring
eyes
toward
the
cardinal
if
he
sang
from
the
dogwood
she
faced
that
way
if
he
rocked
on
the
wild
she
turned
in
her
nest
if
he
went
to
the
corn
field
for
grubs
she
stood
astride
her
eggs
and
peered
down
watching
his
every
movement
with
unconcealed
anxiety
the
cardinal
forgot
to
be
vain
of
his
beauty
she
delighted
in
it
every
hour
of
the
day
shy
and
timid
beyond
belief
she
had
been
during
her
courtship
but
she
made
reparation
by
being
an
incomparably
generous
and
devoted
mate
and
the
cardinal
he
was
astonished
to
find
himself
capable
of
so
much
and
such
varied
feeling
it
was
not
enough
that
he
brooded
while
she
went
to
bathe
and
exercise
the
daintiest
of
every
morsel
he
found
was
carried
to
her
when
she
refused
to
swallow
another
particle
he
perched
on
a
twig
close
by
the
nest
many
times
in
a
day
and
with
sleek
feathers
and
lowered
crest
gazed
at
her
in
silent
worshipful
adoration
up
and
down
the
river
bank
he
flamed
and
rioted
in
the
sumac
he
uttered
not
the
faintest
chip
that
might
attract
attention
he
was
so
anxious
to
be
inconspicuous
that
he
appeared
only
half
his
real
size
always
on
leaving
he
gave
her
a
tender
little
peck
and
ran
his
beak
the
length
of
her
wing
a
characteristic
caress
that
he
delighted
to
bestow
on
her
if
he
felt
that
he
was
disturbing
her
too
often
he
perched
on
the
dogwood
and
sang
for
life
and
love
and
happiness
his
music
was
in
a
minor
key
now
the
high
exultant
ringing
notes
of
passion
were
mellowed
and
subdued
he
was
improvising
cradle
songs
and
lullabies
he
was
telling
her
how
he
loved
her
how
he
would
fight
for
her
how
he
was
watching
over
her
how
he
would
signal
if
any
danger
were
approaching
how
proud
he
was
of
her
what
a
perfect
nest
she
had
built
how
beautiful
he
thought
her
eggs
what
magnificent
babies
they
would
produce
full
of
tenderness
melting
with
love
liquid
with
sweetness
the
cardinal
sang
to
his
patient
little
brooding
mate
so
dear
so
dear
the
farmer
leaned
on
his
and
listened
to
him
intently
i
swanny
if
he
has
changed
his
song
again
an
this
time
i
blest
if
i
can
tell
what
he
saying
every
time
the
cardinal
lifted
his
voice
the
clip
of
the
ceased
and
abram
hung
on
the
notes
and
studied
them
over
one
night
he
said
to
his
wife
maria
have
you
been
noticin
the
redbird
of
late
he
changed
to
a
new
tune
an
this
time
completely
stalled
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
what
saying
you
step
down
an
see
if
you
can
catch
it
for
me
i
give
a
pretty
to
know
maria
felt
flattered
she
always
had
believed
that
she
had
a
musical
ear
here
was
an
opportunity
to
test
it
and
please
abram
at
the
same
time
she
hastened
her
work
the
following
morning
and
very
early
slipped
along
the
line
fence
hiding
behind
the
oak
with
straining
ear
and
throbbing
heart
she
eagerly
listened
clip
clip
came
the
sound
of
the
planter
as
abram
dear
old
figure
trudged
up
the
hill
chip
chip
came
the
warning
of
the
cardinal
as
he
flew
to
his
mate
he
gave
her
some
food
stroked
her
wing
and
flying
to
the
dogwood
sang
of
the
love
that
encompassed
him
as
he
trilled
forth
his
tender
caressing
strain
the
heart
of
the
listening
woman
translated
as
did
that
of
the
brooding
bird
with
shining
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
she
sped
down
the
fence
panting
and
palpitating
with
excitement
she
met
abram
on
his
return
trip
forgetful
of
her
habitual
reserve
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
drawing
his
face
to
hers
she
cried
oh
abram
i
got
it
i
got
it
i
know
what
he
saying
oh
abram
my
love
my
own
to
me
so
dear
so
dear
so
dear
so
dear
echoed
the
cardinal
the
bewilderment
in
abram
face
melted
into
comprehension
he
swept
maria
from
her
feet
as
he
lifted
his
head
on
my
soul
you
have
got
it
honey
that
what
he
saying
plain
as
gospel
i
can
tell
it
anything
he
sung
yet
now
i
sense
it
he
gathered
maria
in
his
arms
pressed
her
head
against
his
breast
with
a
trembling
old
hand
while
the
face
he
turned
to
the
morning
was
beautiful
i
wish
to
god
he
said
quaveringly
every
creature
on
earth
was
as
well
fixed
as
me
an
the
redbird
clasping
each
other
they
listened
with
rapt
faces
as
mellowing
across
the
corn
field
came
the
notes
of
the
cardinal
so
dear
so
dear
after
that
abram
devotion
to
his
bird
family
became
a
mild
mania
he
carried
food
to
the
top
rail
of
the
line
fence
every
day
rain
or
shine
with
the
same
regularity
that
he
curried
and
fed
nancy
in
the
barn
from
caring
for
and
so
loving
the
cardinal
there
grew
in
his
tender
old
heart
a
welling
flood
of
sympathy
for
every
bird
that
homed
on
his
farm
he
drove
a
stake
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
killdeer
hen
brooded
in
the
corn
field
so
that
he
would
not
drive
nancy
over
the
nest
when
he
closed
the
bars
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
always
was
careful
to
leave
the
third
one
down
for
there
was
a
chippy
brooding
in
the
opening
where
it
fitted
when
closed
alders
and
sweetbriers
grew
in
his
fence
corners
undisturbed
that
spring
if
he
discovered
that
they
sheltered
an
little
mother
he
left
a
square
yard
of
clover
unmowed
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
lark
singing
nearer
the
throne
than
any
other
bird
was
picking
up
stray
notes
dropped
by
the
invisible
choir
and
with
unequalled
purity
and
tenderness
sending
them
ringing
down
to
his
brooding
mate
whose
home
and
happiness
would
be
despoiled
by
the
reaping
of
that
spot
of
green
he
delayed
burning
the
from
the
spring
pruning
back
of
the
orchard
until
fall
when
he
found
it
housed
a
pair
of
fine
thrushes
for
the
song
of
the
thrush
delighted
him
almost
as
much
as
that
of
the
lark
he
left
a
hollow
limb
on
the
old
red
pearmain
because
when
he
came
to
cut
it
there
was
a
pair
of
bluebirds
twittering
around
frantic
with
anxiety
his
pockets
were
bulgy
with
wheat
and
crumbs
and
his
heart
was
big
with
happiness
it
was
the
golden
springtime
of
his
later
life
the
sky
never
had
seemed
so
blue
or
the
earth
so
beautiful
the
cardinal
had
opened
the
fountains
of
his
soul
life
took
on
a
new
colour
and
joy
while
every
work
of
god
manifested
a
fresh
and
heretofore
unappreciated
loveliness
his
very
muscles
seemed
to
relax
and
new
strength
arose
to
meet
the
demands
of
his
uplifted
spirit
he
had
not
finished
his
day
work
with
such
ease
and
pleasure
in
years
and
he
could
see
the
influence
of
his
rejuvenation
in
maria
she
was
flitting
around
her
house
with
broken
snatches
of
song
even
sweeter
to
ears
than
the
notes
of
the
birds
and
in
recent
days
he
had
noticed
that
she
dressed
particularly
for
her
afternoon
sewing
putting
on
her
sunday
lace
collar
and
a
white
apron
he
immediately
went
to
town
and
bought
her
a
finer
collar
than
she
ever
had
owned
in
her
life
then
he
hunted
a
sign
painter
and
came
home
bearing
a
number
of
pine
boards
on
which
gleamed
in
big
shiny
black
letters
no
hunting
allowed
on
this
farm
he
seemed
slightly
embarrassed
when
he
showed
them
to
maria
i
feel
a
little
mite
onfriendly
putting
up
signs
like
that
my
neighbours
he
admitted
but
the
fact
is
it
ai
the
neighbours
so
much
as
it
boys
that
need
raising
an
them
town
creatures
who
call
themselves
sportsmen
an
kill
a
to
see
if
they
can
hit
it
time
was
when
trees
an
underbrush
were
full
o
birds
squirrels
any
amount
o
rabbits
an
the
fish
fairly
crowdin
in
the
river
i
used
to
kill
all
the
quail
an
wild
turkeys
about
here
a
body
needed
to
make
an
appetizing
change
it
was
always
my
plan
to
take
a
little
an
leave
a
little
but
jest
look
at
it
now
surprise
o
my
life
if
i
get
a
bass
wild
turkey
gobblin
would
scare
me
most
out
of
my
senses
an
as
for
the
birds
there
are
jest
about
a
fourth
what
there
used
to
be
an
the
crops
eaten
to
pay
for
it
do
all
i
tryin
to
for
any
bird
because
of
its
song
an
colour
pretty
teeterin
ways
but
i
ai
so
slow
but
i
see
i
paid
in
what
they
do
for
me
up
go
these
signs
an
it
wo
be
a
happy
day
for
anybody
i
catch
trespassin
on
my
birds
maria
studied
the
signs
meditatively
you
should
be
forced
to
put
up
she
said
conclusively
if
it
been
decided
it
good
for
to
be
here
an
laws
made
to
protect
people
ought
to
act
with
some
sense
an
leave
them
alone
i
never
was
so
in
the
birds
in
all
my
life
an
i
jest
do
a
little
lookin
out
myself
if
you
hear
a
spang
o
the
dinner
bell
when
you
out
in
the
field
you
know
it
means
there
some
one
sneakin
with
a
gun
abram
caught
maria
and
planted
a
resounding
smack
on
her
cheek
where
the
roses
of
girlhood
yet
bloomed
for
him
then
he
filled
his
pockets
with
crumbs
and
grain
and
strolled
to
the
river
to
set
the
table
he
could
hear
the
sharp
incisive
chip
and
the
tender
mellow
as
he
left
the
barn
and
all
the
way
to
the
sumac
they
rang
in
his
ears
the
cardinal
met
him
at
the
corner
of
the
field
and
hopped
over
bushes
and
the
fence
only
a
few
yards
from
him
when
abram
had
scattered
his
store
on
the
rail
the
bird
came
tipping
and
tilting
daintily
caught
up
a
crumb
and
carried
it
to
the
sumac
his
mate
was
pleased
to
take
it
and
he
carried
her
one
morsel
after
another
until
she
refused
to
open
her
beak
for
more
he
made
a
light
supper
himself
and
then
swinging
on
the
he
closed
the
day
with
an
hour
of
music
he
repeatedly
turned
a
bright
questioning
eye
toward
abram
but
he
never
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
the
nest
and
the
plump
gray
figure
of
his
little
mate
as
she
brooded
over
her
eggs
he
brooded
over
her
and
that
she
might
realize
the
depth
and
constancy
of
his
devotion
he
told
her
repeatedly
with
every
tender
inflection
he
could
throw
into
his
tones
that
she
was
so
dear
so
dear
the
cardinal
had
not
known
that
the
coming
of
the
mate
he
so
coveted
would
fill
his
life
with
such
unceasing
gladness
and
yet
on
the
very
day
that
happiness
seemed
at
fullest
measure
there
was
trouble
in
the
sumac
he
had
overstayed
his
time
chasing
a
fat
moth
he
particularly
wanted
for
his
mate
and
she
growing
thirsty
past
endurance
left
the
nest
and
went
to
the
river
seeing
her
there
he
made
all
possible
haste
to
take
his
turn
at
brooding
so
he
arrived
just
in
time
to
see
a
pilfering
red
squirrel
starting
away
with
an
egg
with
a
vicious
scream
the
cardinal
struck
him
full
force
his
rush
of
rage
cost
the
squirrel
an
eye
but
it
lost
the
father
a
birdling
for
the
squirrel
dropped
the
egg
outside
the
nest
the
cardinal
mournfully
carried
away
the
bits
of
shell
so
that
any
one
seeing
them
would
not
look
up
and
discover
his
treasures
that
left
three
eggs
and
the
brooding
bird
mourned
over
the
lost
one
so
pitifully
that
the
cardinal
perched
close
to
the
nest
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
whispered
over
and
over
for
her
comfort
that
she
was
so
dear
so
dear
chapter
see
here
see
here
demanded
the
cardinal
the
mandate
repeatedly
rang
from
the
topmost
twig
of
the
thorn
tree
and
yet
the
cardinal
was
not
in
earnest
he
was
beside
himself
with
a
new
and
delightful
excitement
and
he
found
it
impossible
to
refrain
from
giving
vent
to
his
feelings
he
was
commanding
the
farmer
and
every
furred
and
feathered
denizen
of
the
river
bottom
to
see
then
he
fought
like
a
wild
thing
if
any
of
them
ventured
close
for
great
things
were
happening
in
the
sumac
in
past
days
the
cardinal
had
brooded
an
hour
every
morning
while
his
mate
went
to
take
her
exercise
bathe
and
fluff
in
the
sun
parlour
he
had
gone
to
her
that
morning
as
usual
and
she
looked
at
him
with
anxious
eyes
and
refused
to
move
he
had
hopped
to
the
very
edge
of
the
nest
and
repeatedly
urged
her
to
go
she
only
ruffled
her
feathers
and
nestled
the
eggs
she
was
brooding
to
turn
them
but
did
not
offer
to
leave
the
cardinal
reached
over
and
gently
nudged
her
with
his
beak
to
remind
her
that
it
was
his
time
to
brood
but
she
looked
at
him
almost
savagely
and
gave
him
a
sharp
peck
so
he
knew
she
was
not
to
be
bothered
he
carried
her
every
dainty
he
could
find
and
hovered
near
her
tense
with
anxiety
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
she
went
after
the
drink
for
which
she
was
half
famished
she
scarcely
had
reached
a
willow
and
bent
over
the
water
before
the
cardinal
was
on
the
edge
of
the
nest
he
examined
it
closely
but
he
could
see
no
change
he
leaned
to
give
the
eggs
careful
scrutiny
and
from
somewhere
there
came
to
him
the
faintest
little
chip
he
ever
had
heard
up
went
the
cardinal
crest
and
he
dashed
to
the
willow
there
was
no
danger
in
sight
and
his
mate
was
greedily
dipping
her
rosy
beak
in
the
water
he
went
back
to
the
cradle
and
listened
intently
and
again
that
feeble
cry
came
to
him
under
the
nest
around
it
and
all
through
the
sumac
he
searched
until
at
last
completely
baffled
he
came
back
to
the
edge
the
sound
was
so
much
plainer
there
that
he
suddenly
leaned
caressing
the
eggs
with
his
beak
then
the
cardinal
knew
he
had
heard
the
first
faint
cries
of
his
babies
with
a
wild
scream
he
made
a
flying
leap
through
the
air
his
heart
was
beating
to
suffocation
he
started
in
a
race
down
the
river
if
he
alighted
on
a
bush
he
took
only
one
swing
and
springing
from
it
flamed
on
in
headlong
flight
he
flashed
to
the
top
of
the
tallest
tulip
tree
and
cried
cloudward
to
the
lark
see
here
see
here
he
dashed
to
the
river
bank
and
told
the
killdeers
and
then
visited
the
underbrush
and
informed
the
thrushes
and
wood
robins
he
grew
so
delirious
with
joy
that
he
forgot
his
habitual
aloofness
and
fraternized
with
every
bird
beside
the
shining
river
he
even
laid
aside
his
customary
caution
went
chipping
into
the
sumac
and
caressed
his
mate
so
boisterously
she
gazed
at
him
severely
and
gave
his
wing
a
savage
pull
to
recall
him
to
his
sober
senses
that
night
the
cardinal
slept
in
the
sumac
very
close
to
his
mate
and
he
shut
only
one
eye
at
a
time
early
in
the
morning
when
he
carried
her
the
first
food
he
found
that
she
was
on
the
edge
of
the
nest
dropping
bits
of
shell
outside
and
creeping
to
peep
he
saw
the
tiniest
coral
baby
with
closed
eyes
and
little
patches
of
soft
silky
down
its
beak
was
wide
open
and
though
his
heart
was
even
fuller
than
on
the
previous
day
the
cardinal
knew
what
that
meant
and
instead
of
indulging
in
another
celebration
he
assumed
the
duties
of
paternity
and
began
searching
for
food
for
now
there
were
two
empty
crops
in
his
family
on
the
following
day
there
were
four
then
he
really
worked
how
eagerly
he
searched
and
how
gladly
he
flew
to
the
sumac
with
every
rare
morsel
the
babies
were
too
small
for
the
mother
to
leave
and
for
the
first
few
days
the
cardinal
was
constantly
on
wing
if
he
could
not
find
sufficiently
dainty
food
for
them
in
the
trees
and
bushes
or
among
the
offerings
of
the
farmer
he
descended
to
earth
and
searched
like
a
wood
robin
he
forgot
he
needed
a
bath
or
owned
a
sun
parlour
but
everywhere
he
went
from
his
full
heart
there
constantly
burst
the
cry
see
here
see
here
his
mate
made
never
a
sound
her
eyes
were
bigger
and
softer
than
ever
and
in
them
glowed
a
steady
lovelight
she
hovered
over
those
three
red
mites
of
nestlings
so
tenderly
she
was
so
absorbed
in
feeding
stroking
and
coddling
them
she
neglected
herself
until
she
became
quite
lean
when
the
cardinal
came
every
few
minutes
with
food
she
was
a
picture
of
love
and
gratitude
for
his
devoted
attention
and
once
she
reached
over
and
softly
kissed
his
wing
see
here
see
here
shrilled
the
cardinal
and
in
his
ecstasy
he
again
forgot
himself
and
sang
in
the
sumac
then
he
carried
food
with
greater
activity
than
ever
to
cover
his
lapse
the
farmer
knew
that
it
lacked
an
hour
of
noon
but
he
was
so
anxious
to
tell
maria
the
news
that
he
could
not
endure
the
suspense
another
minute
there
was
a
new
song
from
the
sumac
he
had
heard
it
as
he
turned
the
first
corner
with
the
shovel
plow
he
had
listened
eagerly
and
had
caught
the
meaning
almost
at
once
see
here
see
here
he
tied
the
old
gray
mare
to
the
fence
to
prevent
her
eating
the
young
corn
and
went
immediately
by
leaning
a
rail
against
the
thorn
tree
he
was
able
to
peer
into
the
sumac
and
take
a
good
look
at
the
nest
of
handsome
birdlings
now
well
screened
with
the
foliage
it
seemed
to
abram
that
he
never
could
wait
until
noon
he
critically
examined
the
harness
in
the
hope
that
he
would
find
a
buckle
missing
and
tried
to
discover
a
flaw
in
the
plow
that
would
send
him
to
the
barn
for
a
file
but
he
could
not
invent
an
excuse
for
going
so
when
he
had
waited
until
an
hour
of
noon
he
could
endure
it
no
longer
got
news
for
you
maria
he
called
from
the
well
where
he
was
making
a
pretense
of
thirst
oh
i
do
know
answered
maria
with
a
superior
smile
if
about
the
redbirds
he
been
up
to
the
garden
three
times
this
morning
yellin
here
fit
to
split
an
i
jest
figured
that
their
little
ones
had
hatched
is
that
your
news
well
i
be
durned
gasped
the
astonished
abram
abram
turned
nancy
and
started
the
plow
down
a
row
that
led
straight
to
the
sumac
he
intended
to
stop
there
tie
to
the
fence
and
go
to
the
river
bank
in
the
shade
for
a
visit
with
the
cardinal
it
was
very
warm
and
he
was
feeling
the
heat
so
much
that
in
his
heart
he
knew
he
would
be
glad
to
reach
the
end
of
the
row
and
the
rest
he
had
promised
himself
the
quick
nervous
strokes
of
the
dinner
bell
clang
clang
came
cutting
the
air
clearly
and
sharply
abram
stopped
nancy
with
a
jerk
it
was
the
warning
maria
had
promised
to
send
him
if
she
saw
prowlers
with
guns
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
scanned
the
points
of
the
compass
through
narrowed
lids
with
concentrated
vision
he
first
caught
a
gleam
of
light
playing
on
a
and
then
he
could
discern
the
figure
of
a
man
clad
in
hunter
outfit
leisurely
walking
down
the
lane
toward
the
river
abram
hastily
hitched
nancy
to
the
fence
by
making
the
best
time
he
could
he
reached
the
opposite
corner
and
was
nibbling
the
midrib
of
a
young
corn
blade
and
placidly
viewing
the
landscape
when
the
hunter
passed
howdy
he
said
in
an
even
cordial
voice
the
hunter
walked
on
without
lifting
his
eyes
or
making
audible
reply
to
abram
friendly
oldfashioned
heart
this
seemed
the
rankest
discourtesy
and
there
was
a
flash
in
his
eye
and
a
certain
quality
in
his
voice
he
lifted
a
hand
for
parley
hold
a
minute
my
friend
he
said
since
you
are
on
my
premises
might
i
be
privileged
to
ask
if
you
have
seen
a
few
signs
i
have
posted
pertainin
to
the
use
of
a
gun
i
am
not
blind
replied
the
hunter
and
my
education
has
been
looked
after
to
the
extent
that
i
can
make
out
your
notices
from
the
number
and
size
of
them
i
think
i
could
do
it
old
man
if
i
had
no
eyes
the
scarcely
suppressed
sneer
and
the
old
man
grated
on
nerves
amazingly
for
a
man
of
sixty
years
of
peace
the
gleam
in
his
eyes
grew
stronger
and
there
was
a
perceptible
lift
of
his
shoulders
as
he
answered
i
meant
to
be
read
an
understood
from
the
main
road
that
cabin
up
there
on
the
bank
straight
to
the
river
an
from
the
furthermost
line
o
this
field
to
the
same
is
my
premises
an
on
every
foot
of
the
signs
are
in
full
force
they
in
a
little
fuller
force
in
june
when
half
the
bushes
an
tufts
o
grass
are
housin
a
young
bird
family
at
any
other
time
they
sort
upholdin
the
legislature
act
providing
for
the
protection
o
game
an
singin
birds
an
maybe
it
be
well
for
you
to
notice
not
so
old
but
i
able
to
stand
up
for
my
right
to
any
livin
man
there
certainly
was
an
added
tinge
of
respect
in
the
hunter
tones
as
he
asked
would
you
consider
it
trespass
if
a
man
simply
crossed
your
land
following
the
line
of
the
fences
to
reach
the
farm
of
a
friend
certainly
not
cried
abram
cordial
in
his
relief
to
be
sure
not
glad
to
have
you
convenience
yourself
i
only
wanted
to
jest
call
to
your
notice
the
birds
are
protected
on
this
farm
i
have
no
intention
of
interfering
with
your
precious
birds
i
assure
you
replied
the
hunter
and
if
you
require
an
explanation
of
the
gun
in
june
i
confess
i
did
hope
to
be
able
to
pick
off
a
squirrel
for
a
very
sick
friend
but
i
suppose
for
even
such
cause
it
would
not
be
allowed
on
your
premises
oh
pshaw
now
said
abram
man
alive
i
not
onreasonable
course
in
case
o
sickness
i
be
glad
if
you
could
run
across
a
squirrel
all
i
wanted
was
to
have
a
clear
understandin
about
the
birds
good
luck
an
good
day
to
you
abram
started
across
the
field
to
nancy
but
he
repeatedly
turned
to
watch
the
gleam
of
the
as
the
hunter
rounded
the
corner
and
started
down
the
river
bank
he
saw
him
leave
the
line
of
the
fence
and
disappear
in
the
thicket
goin
straight
for
the
sumac
muttered
abram
it
likely
i
a
fool
for
not
stayin
right
beside
him
past
that
point
an
yet
i
made
it
fair
an
plain
an
he
passed
his
word
he
would
touch
the
birds
he
untied
nancy
and
for
the
second
time
started
toward
the
sumac
he
had
been
plowing
carefully
his
attention
divided
between
the
mare
and
the
corn
but
he
uprooted
half
that
row
for
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
cardinal
home
as
if
he
were
fascinated
and
his
hands
were
shaking
with
undue
excitement
as
he
gripped
the
plow
handles
at
last
he
stopped
nancy
and
stood
gazing
eagerly
toward
the
river
must
be
jest
about
the
sumac
he
whispered
lord
but
i
be
glad
to
see
the
old
gleamin
safe
side
o
it
there
was
a
thin
puff
of
smoke
and
a
screaming
echo
went
rolling
and
reverberating
down
the
wabash
abram
eyes
widened
and
a
curious
whiteness
settled
on
his
lips
he
stood
as
if
incapable
of
moving
clang
clang
came
maria
second
warning
the
trembling
slid
from
him
and
his
muscles
hardened
there
was
no
trace
of
rheumatic
stiffness
in
his
movements
with
a
bound
he
struck
the
from
the
singletree
at
nancy
heels
he
caught
the
hames
leaped
on
her
back
and
digging
his
heels
into
her
sides
he
stretched
along
her
neck
like
an
indian
and
raced
across
the
corn
field
nancy
twenty
years
slipped
from
her
as
her
master
sixty
had
from
him
without
understanding
the
emergency
she
knew
that
he
required
all
the
speed
there
was
in
her
and
with
rattling
and
beating
on
her
heels
she
stretched
out
until
she
fairly
swept
the
young
corn
as
she
raced
for
the
sumac
once
abram
straightened
and
slipping
a
hand
into
his
pocket
drew
out
a
formidable
opening
it
as
he
rode
when
he
reached
the
fence
he
almost
flew
over
nancy
head
he
went
into
a
fence
corner
and
with
a
few
slashes
severed
a
stout
hickory
withe
stripping
the
leaves
and
topping
it
as
he
leaped
the
fence
he
grasped
this
ugly
weapon
his
eyes
dark
with
anger
as
he
appeared
before
the
hunter
who
supposed
him
at
the
other
side
of
the
field
did
you
shoot
at
that
redbird
he
roared
as
his
gun
was
at
the
sportman
shoulder
and
he
was
still
peering
among
the
bushes
denial
seemed
useless
yes
i
did
he
replied
and
made
a
pretense
of
turning
to
the
sumac
again
there
was
a
forward
impulse
of
abram
body
hit
he
demanded
with
awful
calm
thought
i
had
but
i
guess
i
only
winged
him
abram
fingers
closed
around
his
club
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
cardinal
came
darting
through
the
bushes
a
wavering
flame
and
swept
so
closely
to
him
for
protection
that
a
wing
almost
brushed
his
cheek
see
here
see
here
shrilled
the
bird
in
deadly
panic
there
was
not
a
cut
feather
on
him
abram
relief
was
so
great
he
seemed
to
shrink
an
inch
in
height
young
man
you
better
thank
your
god
you
missed
that
bird
he
said
solemnly
for
if
you
killed
him
i
this
stick
to
ribbons
on
you
an
i
most
afraid
i
would
when
to
quit
he
advanced
a
step
in
his
eagerness
and
the
hunter
mistaking
his
motive
levelled
his
gun
drop
that
shouted
abram
as
he
broke
through
the
bushes
that
clung
to
him
tore
the
clothing
from
his
shoulders
and
held
him
back
drop
that
do
you
dare
point
a
weapon
at
me
on
my
own
premises
after
you
passed
your
word

word
repeated
abram
with
withering
scorn
his
white
quivering
old
face
terrible
to
see
young

o

some
o
them
furrin
parts

it
so
made
the
heathens
can
pitch
it
an
it
cuts
a
circle
an
comes
back
to
the
fellow
at
throwed
i
ca
see
myself
an
i
do
know
how
small
i
lookin
but
i
rather
lose
ten
year
my
life
to
have
anybody
catch
me
lookin
as
little
as
you
do
right
now
i
guess
we
look
about
the
way
we
feel
in
this
world
i
near
the
size
o
goliath
at
present
but
your
size
is
such
it
hustles
me
to
see
any
man
in
you
at
all
an
you
wanted
to
make
me
feel
small
my
oh
my
an
you
so
young
yet
too
an
if
it
had
a
matter
o
breakin
your
word
what
you
want
to
kill
the
redbird
for
anyhow
who
give
you
rights
to
go
takin
such
beauty
an
joy
out
of
the
world
who
do
you
think
made
this
world
an
the
things
in
it
maybe
it
your
notion
somebody
about
your
size
whittled
it
from
a
block
o
wood
scattered
a
little
sand
for
earth
stuck
a
few
seeds
for
trees
an
started
the
oceans
with
a
waterin
pot
i
do
know
what
paved
streets
an
stall
feedin
do
for
a
man
but
any
one
lived
sixty
year
on
the
ground
knows
this
whole
old
earth
is
jest
teemin
with
work
too
big
for
anything
but
a
god
an
a
mighty
big
god
at
that
you
do
never
need
bother
none
the
diskivries
o
science
for
if
science
could
prove
the
earth
was
a
red
hot
slag
broken
from
the
sun
balled
an
cooled
flyin
through
space
until
the
force
gravity
caught
an
held
it
it
does
prove
what
the
sun
broke
from
or
why
it
balled
an
did
cool
sky
over
your
head
earth
under
foot
trees
around
you
an
river
there
all
full
o
life
you
no
mortal
right
to
touch
god
made
it
an
it
his
course
i
know
he
said
distinct
man
was
to
have
over
the
beasts
o
the
field
an
the
fowls
o
the
air
an
that
means
you
free
to
smash
a
copperhead
instead
of
letting
it
sting
you
means
you
better
shoot
a
wolf
than
to
let
it
carry
off
your
lambs
means
at
it
right
to
kill
a
hawk
an
save
your
chickens
but
god
knows
shootin
a
redbird
just
to
see
the
feathers
fly
is
having
dominion
over
anything
it
jest
makin
a
plumb
beast
o
yerself
passes
me
how
you
can
face
up
to
the
almighty
an
draw
a
bead
on
a
thing
like
that
takes
more
i
got
god
never
made
anything
prettier
that
bird
an
he
must
mighty
proud
o
the
job
jest
cast
your
eyes
on
it
there
ever
see
anything
so
runnin
over
with
dainty
pretty
coaxin
ways
little
red
creatures
full
o
too
ever
think
o
that
last
year
bird
hatched
hereabout
like
as
not
went
south
for
winter
an
made
friends
been
feedin
an
teachin
it
to
trust
mankind
back
this
spring
in
a
night
an
struck
that
sumac
over
a
month
ago
broke
me
all
up
first
time
i
ever
set
eyes
on
it
biggest
reddest
redbird
i
ever
saw
an
jest
a
master
hand
at
english
talk
plain
as
you
can
do
know
what
he
said
down
south
but
you
can
bank
on
it
it
was
sumpin
pretty
fine
when
he
settled
here
he
was
discoursin
on
the
weather
an
he
talked
it
out
about
proper
he
say
year
wet
year
jest
like
that
he
got
the
jest
as
good
as
i
can
an
if
he
drawed
the
out
a
little
still
any
blockhead
could
what
he
was
sayin
an
in
a
voice
pretty
an
clear
as
a
bell
then
he
got
an
begged
for
until
he
broke
me
all
up
an
if
i
a
hen
redbird
i
would
so
long
comin
had
me
pulverized
in
no
time
then
a
little
hen
comes
an
stops
with
him
an
was
like
an
organ
playin
prayers
to
hear
him
tell
her
how
he
loved
her
now
they
got
a
nest
full
o
the
cunningest
little
topknot
babies
he
splittin
the
echoes
calling
for
the
whole
neighbourhood
to
come
see
he
so
mortal
proud
stake
my
life
he
never
been
fired
on
afore
he
pretty
near
wild
with
narvousness
but
he
got
too
much
spunk
to
leave
his
go
off
an
hide
from
creatures
like
you
they
no
caution
in
him
look
at
him
tearin
to
give
you
another
chance
i
felt
most
too
rheumaticky
to
tackle
field
work
this
spring
until
he
come
an
the
fire
o
his
coat
an
song
got
me
warmed
up
as
i
ai
been
in
years
work
gone
like
it
was
greased
an
my
been
singin
for
joy
o
life
an
happiness
minute
o
the
time
since
he
come
been
carryin
him
grub
to
that
top
rail
once
an
twice
a
day
for
the
last
month
an
i
can
go
in
three
feet
o
him
my
wife
comes
to
see
him
an
brings
him
stuff
an
we
about
worship
him
who
are
you
to
come
an
wipe
out
his
joy
in
life
an
our
joy
in
him
for
jest
nothin
you
a
left
him
to
rot
on
the
ground
if
a
hit
him
an
me
an
maria
loved
him
so
ever
stop
to
think
how
full
this
world
is
o
things
to
love
if
your
heart
jest
big
enough
to
let
in
we
love
to
live
for
the
beauty
o
the
things
surroundin
us
an
the
joy
we
take
in
bein
among
an
it
my
belief
the
way
to
make
folks
love
us
is
for
us
to
be
able
to
what
they
can
do
if
a
man
puttin
his
heart
an
soul
an
blood
an
an
bones
into
paintin
picters
you
can
talk
farmin
to
him
all
day
an
he
dumb
but
jest
show
him
you
see
what
he
at
in
his
work
an
he
love
you
like
a
brother
whatever
anybody
succeeds
in
it
success
they
so
love
it
they
put
the
best
o
theirselves
into
it
an
so
what
they
do
is
lovin
them
it
kill
a
to
put
the
best
o
himself
into
his
picture
an
then
have
some
fellow
like
you
come
an
pour
turpentine
on
it
jest
to
see
the
paint
run
an
i
think
it
must
pretty
well
use
god
up
to
figure
out
how
to
make
an
colour
a
thing
like
that
bird
an
then
have
you
walk
up
an
shoot
the
little
red
heart
out
of
it
jest
to
prove
you
can
he
the
very
life
o
this
river
bank
i
as
soon
see
you
dig
up
the
underbrush
an
dry
up
the
river
spoil
the
picture
they
make
against
the
sky
as
to
hev
you
drop
the
redbird
he
the
red
life
o
the
whole
thing
god
must
him
when
his
heart
was
pulsin
hot
with
love
an
the
lust
o
things
an
he
jest
saw
how
pretty
it
be
to
dip
his
featherin
into
the
blood
he
was
puttin
in
his
veins
to
my
mind
ai
no
better
way
to
love
an
worship
god
to
protect
an
these
fine
gifts
he
given
for
our
joy
an
use
worshipin
that
bird
a
kind
o
religion
with
me
getting
the
beauty
from
the
sky
an
the
trees
an
the
grass
an
the
water
god
made
is
nothin
but
doin
him
homage
whole
earth
a
sanctuary
you
can
worship
from
sky
above
to
grass
under
foot
course
each
man
has
his
particular
altar
mine
in
that
cabin
up
at
the
bend
o
the
river
maria
lives
there
god
never
did
cleaner
work
when
he
made
maria
lovin
her
sacrament
she
so
clean
pure
an
honest
an
in
forty
year
i
never
jest
durst
brace
right
up
to
maria
an
try
to
put
in
words
what
she
means
to
me
never
saw
nothin
else
as
beautiful
or
as
good
no
flower
as
fragrant
an
smelly
as
her
hair
on
her
pillow
never
tapped
a
bee
tree
with
honey
sweet
as
her
lips
with
a
love
quiver
ai
a
bird
the
ol
wabash
with
a
voice
up
to
hers
love
o
god
her
kindness
when
she
been
home
to
see
her
folks
been
so
hungry
for
her
i
gone
to
her
closet
an
kissed
the
hem
o
her
skirts
once
i
never
yet
dared
kiss
her
feet
but
i
always
wanted
to
i
laid
out
if
she
dies
first
i
do
it
then
an
maria
cry
her
eyes
out
if
you
the
redbird
your
trappin
look
like
you
could
shoot
i
guess
was
god
made
that
shot
fly
the
mark
i
guess
if
you
can
stop
for
the
love
of
mercy
do
it
cried
the
hunter
his
face
was
a
sickly
white
his
temples
wet
with
sweat
and
his
body
trembling
i
ca
endure
any
more
i
do
suppose
you
think
any
human
instincts
at
all
but
i
have
a
few
and
i
see
the
way
to
arouse
more
you
probably
wo
believe
me
but
i
never
kill
another
innocent
harmless
thing
and
i
will
never
lie
again
so
long
as
i
live
he
leaned
his
gun
against
the
thorn
tree
and
dropped
the
remainder
of
his
hunter
outfit
beside
it
on
the
ground
i
do
seem
a
fit
subject
to
dominion
he
said
i
leave
those
thing
for
you
and
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
there
was
a
crash
through
the
bushes
a
leap
over
the
fence
and
abram
and
the
cardinal
were
alone
the
old
man
sat
down
suddenly
on
a
fallen
limb
of
the
sycamore
he
was
almost
dazed
with
astonishment
he
held
up
his
shaking
hands
and
watched
them
wonderingly
and
then
cupped
one
over
each
trembling
knee
to
steady
himself
he
outlined
his
dry
lips
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
breathed
in
heavy
gusts
he
glanced
toward
the
thorn
tree
left
his
gun
he
hoarsely
whispered
an
it
fine
as
a
fiddle
lock
stock
an
barrel
just
an
all
that
heap
o
leather
fixin
must
a
lot
o
money
said
he
was
fit
to
use
lept
the
fence
like
a
panther
an
cut
dirt
across
the
corn
field
left
me
the
gun
well
well
well
wonder
what
i
said
i
must
almost
fierce
see
here
see
here
shrilled
the
cardinal
abram
looked
him
over
carefully
he
was
quivering
with
fear
but
in
no
way
injured
my
but
that
was
a
close
call
ol
fellow
said
abram
minute
later
an
our
fun
over
an
the
summer
jest
spoiled
wonder
if
you
knew
what
it
meant
an
if
you
be
after
this
land
knows
i
hope
so
for
a
few
more
such
doses
jest
lay
me
up
he
gathered
himself
together
at
last
set
the
gun
over
the
fence
and
climbing
after
it
caught
nancy
who
had
feasted
to
plethora
on
young
corn
he
fastened
up
the
and
climbing
to
her
back
laid
the
gun
across
his
lap
and
rode
to
the
barn
he
attended
the
mare
with
particular
solicitude
and
bathed
his
face
and
hands
in
the
water
trough
to
make
himself
a
little
more
presentable
to
maria
he
started
to
the
house
but
had
only
gone
a
short
way
when
he
stopped
and
after
standing
in
thought
for
a
time
turned
back
to
the
barn
and
gave
nancy
another
ear
of
corn
after
all
it
was
all
you
ol
girl
he
said
patting
her
shoulder
i
never
on
earth
could
it
on
time
afoot
he
was
so
tired
he
leaned
for
support
against
her
for
the
unusual
exertion
and
intense
excitement
were
telling
on
him
sorely
and
as
he
rested
he
confided
to
her
i
do
know
as
i
ever
in
my
life
was
so
riled
nancy
i
afraid
i
was
a
little
mite
fierce
he
exhibited
the
gun
and
told
the
story
very
soberly
at
supper
time
and
maria
was
so
filled
with
solicitude
for
him
and
the
bird
and
so
indignant
at
the
act
of
the
hunter
that
she
never
said
a
word
about
abram
torn
clothing
and
the
hours
of
patching
that
would
ensue
she
sat
looking
at
the
gun
and
thinking
intently
for
a
long
time
and
then
she
said
pityingly
i
do
know
jest
what
you
could
make
a
man
go
off
leave
a
gun
like
that
poor
fellow
i
do
hope
abram
you
did
come
down
on
him
too
awful
strong
maybe
he
lost
his
mother
when
he
was
jest
a
little
tyke
an
he
has
had
much
teachin
abram
was
completely
worn
out
and
went
early
to
bed
far
in
the
night
maria
felt
him
fumbling
around
her
face
in
an
effort
to
learn
if
she
were
covered
and
as
he
drew
the
sheet
over
her
shoulder
he
muttered
in
worn
and
sleepy
tones
i
afraid
they
no
use
denyin
it
maria
i
was
jest
mortal
fierce
in
the
sumac
the
frightened
little
mother
cardinal
was
pressing
her
precious
babies
close
against
her
breast
and
all
through
the
night
she
kept
calling
to
her
mate
chook
chook
and
was
satisfied
only
when
an
answering
chip
came
as
for
the
cardinal
he
had
learned
a
new
lesson
he
had
not
been
under
fire
before
never
again
would
he
trust
any
one
carrying
a
shining
thing
that
belched
fire
and
smoke
he
had
seen
the
hunter
coming
and
had
raced
home
to
defend
his
mate
and
babies
thus
making
a
brilliant
mark
of
himself
and
as
he
would
not
have
deserted
them
only
the
arrival
of
the
farmer
had
averted
a
tragedy
in
the
sumac
he
did
not
learn
to
use
caution
for
himself
but
after
that
if
a
gun
came
down
the
shining
river
he
sent
a
warning
chip
to
his
mate
telling
her
to
crouch
low
in
her
nest
and
keep
very
quiet
and
then
in
broken
waves
of
flight
and
with
chirp
and
flutter
he
exposed
himself
until
he
had
lured
danger
from
his
beloved
ones
when
the
babies
grew
large
enough
for
their
mother
to
leave
them
a
short
time
she
assisted
in
food
hunting
and
the
cardinal
was
not
so
busy
he
then
could
find
time
frequently
to
mount
to
the
top
of
the
dogwood
and
cry
to
the
world
see
here
see
here
for
the
cardinal
babies
were
splendid
but
his
music
was
broken
intermittent
vocalizing
now
often
uttered
past
a
beakful
of
food
and
interspersed
with
spasmodic
chips
if
danger
threatened
his
mate
and
nestlings
despite
all
their
care
it
was
not
so
very
long
until
trouble
came
to
the
sumac
and
it
was
all
because
the
was
plainly
greedy
much
more
so
than
either
his
little
brother
or
his
sister
and
he
was
one
day
ahead
of
them
in
strength
he
always
pushed
himself
forward
cried
the
loudest
and
longest
and
so
took
the
greater
part
of
the
food
carried
to
the
nest
and
one
day
while
he
was
still
quite
awkward
and
uncertain
he
climbed
to
the
edge
and
reached
so
far
that
he
fell
he
rolled
down
the
river
bank
splash
into
the
water
and
a
hungry
old
pickerel
sunning
in
the
weeds
finished
him
at
a
snap
he
made
a
morsel
so
fat
sweet
and
juicy
that
the
pickerel
lingered
close
for
a
week
waiting
to
see
if
there
would
be
any
more
accidents
the
cardinal
hunting
grubs
in
the
corn
field
heard
the
frightened
cries
of
his
mate
and
dashed
to
the
sumac
in
time
to
see
the
poor
little
ball
of
brightly
tinted
feathers
disappear
in
the
water
and
to
hear
the
splash
of
the
fish
he
called
in
helpless
panic
and
fluttered
over
the
spot
he
watched
and
waited
until
there
was
no
hope
of
the
nestling
coming
up
then
he
went
to
the
sumac
to
try
to
comfort
his
mate
she
could
not
be
convinced
that
her
young
one
was
gone
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
filled
the
air
with
alarm
cries
and
notes
of
wailing
the
two
that
remained
were
surely
the
envy
of
birdland
the
male
baby
was
a
perfect
copy
of
his
big
crimson
father
only
his
little
coat
was
gray
but
it
was
so
highly
tinged
with
red
that
it
was
brilliant
and
his
beak
and
feet
were
really
red
and
how
his
crest
did
flare
and
how
proud
and
important
he
felt
when
he
found
he
could
raise
and
lower
it
at
will
his
sister
was
not
nearly
so
bright
as
he
and
she
was
almost
as
greedy
as
the
lost
brother
with
his
father
chivalry
he
allowed
her
to
crowd
in
and
take
the
most
of
the
seeds
and
berries
so
that
she
continually
appeared
as
if
she
could
swallow
no
more
yet
she
was
constantly
calling
for
food
she
took
the
first
flight
being
so
greedy
she
forgot
to
be
afraid
and
actually
flew
to
a
neighbouring
thorn
tree
to
meet
the
cardinal
coming
with
food
before
she
realized
what
she
had
done
for
once
gluttony
had
its
proper
reward
she
not
only
missed
the
bite
but
she
got
her
little
self
mightily
well
scared
with
popping
eyes
and
crest
she
clung
to
the
thorn
limb
shivering
at
the
depths
below
and
it
was
the
greatest
comfort
when
her
brother
plucked
up
courage
and
came
sailing
across
to
her
but
of
course
she
could
not
be
expected
to
admit
that
when
she
saw
how
easily
he
did
it
she
flared
her
crest
turned
her
head
indifferently
and
inquired
if
he
did
not
find
flying
a
very
easy
matter
once
he
mustered
courage
to
try
it
and
she
made
him
very
much
ashamed
indeed
because
he
had
allowed
her
to
be
the
first
to
leave
the
nest
from
the
thorn
tree
they
worked
their
way
to
the
dead
sycamore
but
there
the
lack
of
foliage
made
them
so
conspicuous
that
their
mother
almost
went
into
spasms
from
fright
and
she
literally
drove
them
back
to
the
sumac
the
cardinal
was
so
inordinately
proud
and
made
such
a
brave
showing
of
teaching
them
to
fly
bathe
and
all
the
other
things
necessary
for
young
birds
to
know
that
it
was
a
great
mercy
they
escaped
with
their
lives
he
had
mastered
many
lessons
but
he
never
could
be
taught
how
to
be
quiet
and
conceal
himself
with
explosive
chips
flaming
and
flashing
he
met
dangers
that
sent
all
the
other
birds
beside
the
shining
river
racing
to
cover
concealment
he
scorned
and
repose
he
never
knew
it
was
a
summer
full
of
rich
experience
for
the
cardinal
after
these
first
babies
were
raised
and
had
flown
two
more
nests
were
built
and
two
other
broods
flew
around
the
sumac
by
fall
the
cardinal
was
the
father
of
a
small
flock
and
they
were
each
one
neat
trim
beautiful
river
birds
he
had
lived
through
spring
with
its
perfumed
air
pale
flowers
and
burning
heart
hunger
he
had
known
summer
in
its
golden
mood
with
forests
pungent
with
spicebush
and
sassafras
festooned
with
wild
grape
woodbine
and
bittersweet
carpeted
with
velvet
moss
and
starry
mandrake
peeping
from
beneath
green
shades
the
murmur
of
the
shining
river
and
the
rich
fulfilment
of
love
fruition
now
it
was
fall
and
all
the
promises
of
spring
were
accomplished
the
woods
were
glorious
in
autumnal
tints
there
were
ripened
red
haws
black
haws
and
wild
grapes
only
waiting
for
severe
frosts
nuts
rattling
down
scurrying
squirrels
and
the
rabbits
flash
of
gray
and
brown
the
waysides
were
bright
with
the
glory
of
goldenrod
and
royal
with
the
purple
of
asters
and
ironwort
there
was
the
rustle
of
falling
leaves
the
flitting
of
velvety
butterflies
the
whir
of
wings
trained
southward
and
the
call
of
the
king
crow
gathering
his
followers
then
to
the
cardinal
came
the
intuition
that
it
was
time
to
lead
his
family
to
the
orange
orchard
one
day
they
flamed
and
rioted
up
and
down
the
shining
river
raced
over
the
corn
field
and
tilted
on
the
sumac
the
next
a
black
frost
had
stripped
its
antlered
limbs
stark
and
deserted
it
stood
a
picture
of
loneliness
o
bird
of
wonderful
plumage
and
song
what
a
precious
thought
of
divinity
to
create
such
beauty
and
music
for
our
pleasure
brave
songster
of
the
flaming
coat
too
proud
to
hide
your
flashing
beauty
too
fearless
to
be
cautious
of
the
many
dangers
that
beset
you
from
the
top
of
the
morning
we
greet
you
and
hail
you
king
of
birdland
at
your
imperious
command
