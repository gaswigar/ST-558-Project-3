in

what
a
change
from
the
arizona
desert
the
words
broke
from
the
lips
of
ken
ward
as
he
leaned
from
the
window
of
the
train
which
was
bearing
his
brother
and
himself
over
the
plateau
to
tampico
in
tamaulipas
the
southeastern
state
of
mexico
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
river
leaping
out
between
heavily
wooded
slopes
and
plunging
down
in
the
most
beautiful
waterfall
he
had
ever
seen
look
hal
he
cried
the
first
fall
was
a
long
white
streak
ending
in
a
dark
pool
below
came
cascade
after
cascade
fall
after
fall
some
wide
others
narrow
and
all
white
and
green
against
the
yellow
rock
then
the
train
curved
round
a
spur
of
the
mountain
descended
to
a
level
to
be
lost
in
a
luxuriance
of
jungle
growth
it
was
indeed
a
change
for
ken
ward
young
forester
pitcher
of
the
varsity
nine
at
school
and
hunter
of
lions
in
the
arizona
cañons
here
he
was
entering
the
jungle
of
the
tropics
the
rifles
and
the
camp
outfit
on
the
seat
beside
his
brother
hal
and
himself
spoke
of
coming
adventures
before
them
lay
an
unknown
wilderness
the
jungle
and
the
future
was
to
show
that
the
mystery
of
the
jungle
was
stranger
even
than
their
imaginings
it
was
not
love
of
adventure
alone
or
interest
in
the
strange
new
forest
growths
that
had
drawn
ken
to
the
jungle
his
uncle
the
one
who
had
gotten
ken
letters
from
the
forestry
department
at
washington
had
been
proud
of
ken
s
arizona
achievements
this
uncle
was
a
member
of
the
american
geographical
society
and
a
fellow
of
the
new
york
museum
of
natural
history
he
wanted
ken
to
try
his
hand
at
field
work
in
the
jungle
of
mexico
and
if
that
was
successful
then
to
explore
the
ruined
cities
of
wild
yucatan
if
ken
made
good
as
an
explorer
his
reward
was
to
be
a
trip
to
equatorial
africa
after
big
game
and
of
course
that
trip
meant
opportunity
to
see
england
and
france
and
what
meant
more
to
ken
a
chance
to
see
the
great
forests
of
germany
where
forestry
had
been
carried
on
for
three
hundred
years
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
inducement
was
irresistible
and
that
ken
s
father
was
as
proud
and
eager
as
ken
s
uncle
to
have
him
make
a
name
for
himself
and
that
hal
would
be
allowed
to
go
with
him
ken
had
hesitated
there
was
the
responsibility
for
hal
and
the
absolute
certainty
that
hal
could
not
keep
out
of
mischief
still
ken
simply
could
not
have
gone
to
mexico
leaving
his
brother
at
home
at
last
the
thing
had
been
decided
it
was
hal
s
ambition
to
be
a
naturalist
and
to
collect
specimens
and
the
uncle
had
held
out
possible
recognition
from
the
smithsonian
institution
at
washington
perhaps
he
might
find
a
new
variety
of
some
animal
to
which
the
scientists
would
attach
his
name
then
the
lad
was
passionately
eager
to
see
ken
win
that
trip
to
africa
there
had
been
much
study
of
maps
and
books
of
travel
science
and
natural
history
there
had
been
the
most
careful
instruction
and
equipment
for
camp
life
the
uncle
had
given
ken
valuable
lessons
in
in
estimating
distance
and
topography
and
he
had
indicated
any
one
of
several
rivers
in
the
jungle
belt
of
mexico
traversing
one
hundred
miles
of
unknown
jungle
river
with
intelligent
observation
and
accurate
reports
would
win
the
prize
for
ken
ward
now
the
race
was
on
would
ken
win
presently
the
train
crossed
a
bridge
ken
ward
had
a
brief
glance
at
clear
green
water
at
great
gray
and
graceful
with
long
silvery
waving
moss
and
at
the
tangled
colorful
banks
a
black
as
coal
with
wings
skimmed
the
water
in
swift
wild
flight
to
disappear
up
the
shady
then
the
train
clattered
on
and
a
mile
or
more
beyond
the
bridge
stopped
at
a
station
called
valles
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
thatched
huts
and
roofs
of
a
hamlet
the
boys
got
out
to
stretch
their
legs
the
warm
sweet
balmy
air
was
a
new
and
novel
thing
to
them
they
strolled
up
and
down
the
gravel
walk
watching
the
natives
hal
said
he
rather
liked
the
looks
of
their
brown
bare
feet
and
the
thin
cotton
trousers
and
shirts
but
he
fancied
the
enormous
sombreros
were
too
heavy
and
unwieldy
ken
spoke
to
several
mexicans
each
of
whom
replied
no
sabe
señor
the
ticket
agent
at
the
station
was
an
american
and
from
the
way
he
smiled
and
spoke
ken
knew
he
was
more
than
glad
to
see
one
of
his
own
kind
so
after
ken
had
replied
to
many
questions
about
the
states
he
began
to
ask
some
of
his
own
what
s
the
name
of
the
waterfall
we
passed
micas
falls
replied
the
agent
and
the
river
it
s
called
the
santa
rosa
where
does
it
go
the
agent
did
not
know
except
that
it
disappeared
in
the
jungle
southward
the
country
was
wild
the
villages
were
few
and
all
along
the
railroad
and
at
valles
the
river
swung
away
to
the
southwest
but
it
must
flow
into
the
panuco
river
said
ken
he
had
studied
maps
of
mexico
and
had
learned
all
that
it
was
possible
to
learn
before
he
undertook
the
journey
why
yes
it
must
find
the
panuco
somewhere
down
over
the
mountain
answered
the
agent
then
there
are
rapids
in
this
little
river
asked
ken
in
growing
interest
well
i
guess
it
s
all
rapids
how
far
to
tampico
by
rail
went
on
ken
something
over
a
hundred
miles
any
game
in
the
jungle
hereabouts
or
along
the
santa
rosa
continued
ken
the
man
laughed
and
laughed
in
such
a
way
that
ken
did
not
need
his
assertion
that
it
was
not
safe
to
go
into
the
jungle
whereupon
ken
ward
became
so
thoughtful
that
he
did
not
hear
the
talk
that
followed
between
the
agent
and
hal
the
engine
bell
roused
him
into
action
and
with
hal
he
hurried
back
to
their
seats
and
then
the
train
sped
on
but
the
beauty
of
micas
falls
and
the
wildness
of
the
santa
rosa
remained
with
ken
where
did
that
river
go
how
many
waterfalls
and
rapids
did
it
have
what
teeming
life
must
be
along
its
rich
banks
it
haunted
ken
he
wanted
to
learn
the
mystery
of
the
jungle
there
was
the
same
longing
which
had
gotten
him
into
the
wild
adventures
in
penetier
forest
and
the
grand
cañon
country
of
arizona
and
all
at
once
flashed
over
him
the
thought
that
here
was
the
jungle
river
for
him
to
explore
why
that
s
the
very
thing
he
said
thinking
aloud
what
s
wrong
with
you
asked
hal
talking
to
yourself
that
way
ken
did
not
explain
the
train
clattered
between
green
walls
of
jungle
and
occasionally
stopped
at
a
station
but
the
thought
of
the
jungle
haunted
him
until
the
train
arrived
at
tampico
ken
had
the
name
of
an
american
hotel
and
that
was
all
he
knew
about
tampico
the
station
was
crowded
with
natives
man
after
man
accosted
the
boys
jabbering
excitedly
in
mexican
some
of
these
showed
brass
badges
bearing
a
number
and
the
word
hal
i
believe
these
fellows
are
porters
or
said
ken
and
he
showed
his
trunk
check
to
one
of
them
the
fellow
jerked
it
out
of
ken
s
hand
and
ran
off
the
boys
ran
after
him
they
were
relieved
to
see
him
enter
a
shed
full
of
baggage
and
they
were
amazed
to
see
him
kneel
down
and
take
their
trunk
on
his
back
it
was
a
big
trunk
and
heavy
the
man
was
small
and
light
it
ll
smash
him
cried
hal
but
the
little
walked
off
with
the
trunk
on
his
back
then
ken
and
hal
saw
other
packing
trunks
the
boys
kept
close
to
their
man
and
used
their
eyes
with
exceeding
interest
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
square
colored
buildings
looked
as
if
they
were
in
a
picture
of
spain
look
at
the
boats
canoes
cried
hal
as
they
crossed
a
canal
ken
saw
long
narrow
canoes
that
had
been
hollowed
out
from
straight
they
were
of
every
size
and
some
of
the
paddles
were
enormous
crowds
of
natives
were
jabbering
and
jostling
each
other
at
a
rude
wharf
look
back
called
hal
who
seemed
to
have
a
hundred
eyes
ken
saw
a
wide
beautiful
river
shining
red
in
the
sunset
on
the
distant
shore
showed
black
against
the
horizon
hal
that
s
the
panuco
what
a
river
makes
the
susquehanna
look
like
a
creek
was
hal
s
comment
the
led
the
boys
through
a
plaza
down
a
narrow
street
to
the
hotel
here
they
were
made
to
feel
at
home
the
proprietor
was
a
kindly
american
the
hotel
was
crowded
and
many
of
the
guests
were
englishmen
there
for
the
with
sportsmen
from
the
states
and
settlers
coming
in
to
take
up
new
lands
it
was
pleasant
for
ken
and
hal
to
hear
their
own
language
once
more
after
dinner
they
sallied
forth
to
see
the
town
but
the
narrow
dark
streets
and
the
blanketed
natives
stealing
silently
along
were
not
particularly
inviting
the
boys
got
no
farther
than
the
plaza
where
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
it
was
wholly
different
from
any
american
town
ken
suspected
that
hal
was
getting
homesick
for
the
boy
was
quiet
and
inactive
i
don
t
like
this
place
said
hal
what
d
you
ever
want
to
drag
me
way
down
here
for
humph
drag
you
say
you
pestered
the
life
out
of
me
and
bothered
dad
till
he
was
mad
and
worried
mother
sick
to
let
you
come
on
this
trip
hal
hung
his
head
now
you
re
not
going
to
show
a
streak
of
yellow
asked
ken
he
knew
how
to
stir
his
brother
hal
rose
to
the
attack
and
scornfully
repudiated
the
insinuation
ken
replied
that
they
were
in
a
new
country
and
must
not
reach
conclusions
too
hastily
i
liked
it
back
up
there
at
the
little
village
where
we
saw
the
green
river
and
the
big
trees
with
the
gray
streamers
on
them
said
hal
well
i
liked
that
myself
rejoined
ken
i
d
like
to
go
back
there
and
put
a
boat
in
the
river
and
come
all
the
way
here
ken
had
almost
unconsciously
expressed
the
thought
that
had
been
forming
in
his
mind
hal
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
his
brother
ken
that
d
be
great
that
s
what
we
came
for
i
should
say
so
replied
ken
well
asked
hal
simply
that
question
annoyed
ken
had
he
not
come
south
to
go
into
the
jungle
had
he
come
with
any
intention
of
shirking
the
danger
of
a
wild
trip
there
was
a
subtle
flattery
in
hal
s
question
that
santa
rosa
river
runs
through
the
jungle
went
on
hal
it
flows
into
the
panuco
somewhere
you
know
we
figured
out
on
the
map
that
the
panuco
s
the
only
big
river
in
this
jungle
that
s
all
we
want
to
know
and
ken
you
know
you
re
a
born
boatman
why
look
at
the
rapids
we
ve
shot
on
the
susquehanna
remember
that
trip
we
came
down
the
juniata
the
water
was
high
too
ken
you
can
take
a
boat
down
that
santa
rosa
by
george
i
believe
i
can
exclaimed
ken
and
he
thrilled
at
the
thought
ken
let
s
go
you
ll
win
the
prize
and
i
ll
get
specimens
think
what
we
d
have
to
tell
jim
williams
and
dick
leslie
when
we
go
west
next
summer
oh
hal
i
know
but
this
idea
of
a
trip
seems
too
wild
maybe
it
wouldn
t
be
so
wild
in
all
fairness
ken
could
not
deny
this
so
he
kept
silent
ken
listen
went
on
hal
and
now
he
was
quite
cool
if
we
d
promised
the
governor
not
to
take
a
wild
trip
i
wouldn
t
say
another
word
but
we
re
absolutely
free
that
s
why
we
ought
to
be
more
careful
dad
trusts
me
he
trusts
you
because
he
knows
you
can
take
care
of
yourself
and
me
too
you
re
a
wonder
ken
why
if
you
once
made
up
your
mind
you
d
make
that
santa
rosa
river
look
like
a
canal
ken
began
to
fear
that
he
would
not
be
proof
against
the
haunting
call
of
that
jungle
river
and
the
flattering
persuasion
of
his
brother
and
the
ambition
to
show
his
uncle
what
he
could
do
hal
if
i
didn
t
have
you
with
me
i
d
already
have
made
up
my
mind
to
tackle
this
river
that
appeared
to
insult
hal
all
i
ve
got
to
say
is
i
d
be
a
help
to
you
not
a
drag
he
said
with
some
warmth
you
re
always
a
help
hal
i
can
t
say
anything
against
your
willingness
but
you
know
your
weakness
by
george
you
made
trouble
enough
for
me
in
arizona
on
a
trip
such
as
this
you
d
drive
me
crazy
ken
i
won
t
make
any
rash
promises
i
don
t
want
to
queer
myself
with
you
but
i
m
all
right
look
here
hal
let
s
wait
we
ve
only
got
to
tampico
maybe
such
a
trip
is
impracticable
impossible
let
s
find
out
more
about
the
country
hal
appeared
to
take
this
in
good
spirit
the
boys
returned
to
the
hotel
and
went
to
bed
hal
promptly
fell
asleep
but
ken
ward
lay
awake
a
long
time
thinking
of
the
green
santa
rosa
with
its
magnificent
cypresses
and
when
he
did
go
to
sleep
it
was
to
dream
of
the
beautiful
waterfowl
with
the
wings
and
he
was
following
it
on
its
wild
flight
down
the
dark
mysterious
into
the
jungle
home
of
the
hal
s
homesickness
might
never
have
been
in
evidence
at
all
to
judge
from
the
way
the
boy
awakening
at
dawn
began
to
talk
about
the
santa
rosa
trip
well
said
ken
as
he
rolled
out
of
bed
i
guess
we
re
in
for
it
ken
will
we
go
asked
hal
eagerly
i
m
on
the
fence
but
you
re
leaning
on
the
jungle
side
yes
kid
i
m
slipping
hal
opened
his
lips
to
let
out
a
regular
hiram
bent
yell
when
ken
clapped
a
hand
over
his
mouth
hold
on
we
re
in
the
hotel
yet
it
took
the
brothers
long
to
dress
because
they
could
not
keep
away
from
the
window
the
sun
was
rising
in
rosy
glory
over
misty
lagoons
clouds
of
creamy
mist
rolled
above
the
broad
panuco
wild
ducks
were
flying
low
the
tiled
roofs
of
the
stone
houses
gleamed
brightly
and
the
glistened
with
dew
the
soft
breeze
that
blew
in
was
warm
sweet
and
fragrant
after
breakfast
the
boys
went
out
to
the
front
and
found
the
hotel
lobby
full
of
fishermen
and
their
native
boatmen
it
was
an
interesting
sight
as
well
as
a
surprise
for
ken
and
hal
did
not
know
that
tampico
was
as
famous
for
fishing
as
it
was
for
hunting
the
huge
rods
and
reels
amazed
them
what
kind
of
fish
do
these
fellows
fish
for
asked
hal
ken
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
sport
to
know
something
about
tarpon
but
he
had
never
seen
one
of
the
great
silver
fish
and
he
was
speechless
when
hal
led
him
into
a
room
upon
the
walls
of
which
were
mounted
specimens
of
tarpon
from
six
to
seven
feet
in
length
and
half
as
wide
as
a
door
say
ken
we
ve
come
to
the
right
place
those
fishermen
are
all
going
out
to
fish
for
such
whales
as
these
here
hal
we
never
saw
a
big
fish
before
said
ken
and
before
we
leave
tampico
we
ll
know
what
it
means
to
hook
tarpon
i
m
with
you
replied
hal
gazing
doubtfully
and
wonderingly
at
a
fish
almost
twice
as
big
as
himself
then
ken
being
a
practical
student
of
fishing
as
of
other
kinds
of
sport
began
to
stroll
round
the
lobby
with
an
intent
to
learn
he
closely
scrutinized
the
tackle
and
he
found
that
the
bait
used
was
a
white
mullet
six
to
ten
inches
long
a
little
fish
which
resembled
the
chub
ken
did
not
like
the
long
cruel
gaff
which
seemed
a
necessary
adjunct
to
each
outfit
of
tackle
and
he
vowed
that
in
his
fishing
for
tarpon
he
would
dispense
with
it
ken
was
not
backward
about
asking
questions
and
he
learned
that
tampico
during
the
winter
months
was
a
rendezvous
for
sportsmen
from
all
over
the
world
for
the
most
part
they
came
to
catch
the
leaping
tarpon
the
shooting
along
the
panuco
however
was
as
well
worth
while
as
the
fishing
but
ken
could
not
learn
anything
about
the
santa
rosa
river
the
or
hot
belt
along
the
curve
of
the
gulf
was
intersected
by
small
streams
many
of
them
unknown
and
unnamed
the
panuco
swung
round
to
the
west
and
had
its
source
somewhere
up
in
the
mountains
ken
decided
that
the
santa
rosa
was
one
of
its
headwaters
valles
lay
up
on
the
first
swell
of
higher
ground
and
was
distant
from
tampico
some
six
hours
by
train
so
reckoning
with
the
meandering
course
of
jungle
streams
ken
calculated
he
would
have
something
like
one
hundred
and
miles
to
travel
by
water
from
valles
to
tampico
there
were
indian
huts
strung
along
the
panuco
river
and
fifty
miles
inland
a
village
named
panuco
what
lay
between
panuco
and
valles
up
over
the
wild
steppes
of
that
jungle
ken
ward
could
only
conjecture
presently
he
came
upon
hal
in
conversation
with
an
american
boy
who
at
once
volunteered
to
show
them
around
so
they
set
out
and
were
soon
becoming
well
acquainted
their
guide
said
he
was
from
kansas
had
been
working
in
the
railroad
offices
for
two
years
and
was
now
taking
a
vacation
his
name
was
george
alling
under
his
guidance
the
boys
spent
several
interesting
hours
going
about
the
city
during
this
walk
hal
showed
his
first
tendency
to
revert
to
his
natural
bent
of
mind
not
for
long
could
hal
ward
exist
without
making
trouble
for
something
in
this
case
it
was
buzzards
of
which
the
streets
of
tampico
were
full
in
fact
george
explained
the
buzzards
were
the
only
department
in
the
town
they
were
as
tame
as
tame
turkeys
and
hal
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
chase
them
and
he
could
be
made
to
stop
only
after
a
officer
had
threatened
him
george
explained
further
that
although
tampico
had
no
it
protected
these
of
the
streets
the
at
the
canal
wharf
was
one
place
where
ken
thought
hal
would
forget
himself
in
the
bustle
and
din
and
color
all
was
so
strange
and
new
indeed
for
a
time
hal
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
his
surroundings
but
when
he
came
to
a
stall
where
a
man
had
parrots
and
racoons
and
small
deer
and
three
little
yellow
as
george
called
them
then
once
more
ken
had
to
take
hal
in
tow
outside
along
the
wharf
were
moored
a
hundred
or
more
canoes
of
manifold
variety
all
had
been
hewn
from
solid
some
were
long
slender
graceful
pretty
to
look
at
and
easy
to
handle
in
shallow
lagoons
but
ken
thought
them
too
heavy
and
cumbersome
for
fast
water
happening
just
then
to
remember
micas
falls
ken
had
a
momentary
chill
and
a
check
to
his
enthusiasm
for
the
jungle
trip
what
if
he
encountered
in
coming
down
the
santa
rosa
some
such
series
of
cascades
as
those
which
made
micas
falls
it
was
about
noon
when
george
led
the
boys
out
to
the
banks
of
the
broad
panuco
both
hal
and
ken
were
suffering
from
the
heat
they
had
removed
their
coats
and
were
now
very
glad
to
rest
in
the
shade
this
is
a
nice
cool
day
said
george
and
he
looked
cool
we
ve
got
on
our
heavy
clothes
and
this
tropic
sun
is
new
to
us
replied
ken
say
hal
a
crash
in
the
water
near
the
shore
interrupted
ken
was
that
a
rhinoceros
inquired
hal
savalo
said
george
what
s
that
silver
king
a
tarpon
look
around
and
you
ll
see
one
break
water
there
are
some
fishermen
trolling
watch
maybe
one
will
hook
a
fish
presently
then
you
ll
see
some
jumping
it
was
cool
in
the
shade
as
the
brothers
soon
discovered
and
they
spent
a
delightful
hour
watching
the
river
and
the
wild
fowl
and
the
tarpon
ken
and
hal
were
always
lucky
things
happened
for
their
benefit
and
pleasure
not
only
did
they
see
many
tarpon
swirl
like
bars
of
silver
on
the
water
but
a
fisherman
hooked
one
of
the
great
fish
not
fifty
yards
from
where
the
boys
sat
and
they
held
their
breath
and
with
starting
eyes
watched
the
marvelous
leaps
and
dashes
of
the
tarpon
till
as
he
shot
up
in
a
last
mighty
effort
wagging
his
head
slapping
his
huge
gills
and
flinging
the
hook
like
a
bullet
he
plunged
back
free
nine
out
of
ten
get
away
remarked
george
did
you
ever
catch
one
asked
hal
sure
hal
i
ve
got
to
have
some
of
this
fishing
said
ken
but
if
we
start
at
it
now
would
we
ever
get
that
jungle
trip
oh
ken
you
ve
made
up
your
mind
to
go
exclaimed
hal
in
glee
no
i
haven
t
protested
ken
yes
you
have
declared
hal
i
know
you
and
the
whoop
that
he
had
suppressed
in
the
hotel
he
now
let
out
with
good
measure
naturally
george
was
interested
and
at
his
inquiry
ken
told
him
the
idea
for
the
santa
rosa
trip
take
me
along
said
george
there
was
a
note
of
american
spirit
in
his
voice
a
laugh
on
his
lips
and
a
flash
in
his
eyes
that
made
ken
look
at
him
attentively
he
was
a
slim
youth
not
much
hal
s
senior
and
ken
thought
if
ever
a
boy
had
been
fashioned
to
be
a
boon
comrade
of
hal
ward
this
george
alling
was
the
boy
what
do
you
think
of
the
trip
inquired
ken
curiously
fine
we
ll
have
some
fun
we
ll
get
a
boat
and
a
mozo
what
s
a
mozo
a
native
boatman
that
s
a
good
idea
i
hadn
t
thought
of
a
boatman
to
help
row
but
the
boat
is
the
particular
thing
i
wouldn
t
risk
a
trip
in
one
of
those
canoes
come
on
i
ll
find
a
boat
said
george
and
before
he
knew
it
george
and
hal
were
leading
him
back
from
the
river
george
led
him
down
narrow
lanes
between
painted
stone
houses
and
windows
till
they
reached
the
canal
they
entered
a
yard
where
buzzards
goats
and
pigs
were
contesting
over
the
scavenger
rights
george
went
into
a
and
pointed
out
a
long
light
wide
skiff
with
a
flat
bottom
ken
did
not
need
george
s
praise
or
the
shining
light
in
hal
s
eyes
or
the
s
importunities
to
make
him
eager
to
try
this
particular
boat
ken
ward
knew
a
boat
when
he
saw
one
he
jumped
in
shoved
it
out
rowed
up
the
canal
pulled
and
turned
backed
water
and
tried
every
stroke
he
knew
then
he
rested
on
the
oars
and
whistled
hal
s
shout
of
delight
made
him
stop
whistling
those
two
boys
would
have
him
started
on
the
trip
if
he
did
not
look
sharp
it
s
a
dandy
boat
said
ken
only
a
peso
a
day
ken
went
on
hal
one
dollar
mex
fifty
cents
in
our
money
quick
ken
hire
it
before
somebody
else
gets
it
sure
i
ll
hire
the
boat
replied
ken
but
hal
it
s
not
for
that
santa
rosa
trip
we
ll
have
to
forget
that
forget
your
grandmother
cried
hal
and
then
it
was
plain
that
he
tried
valiantly
to
control
himself
to
hide
his
joy
to
pretend
to
agree
with
ken
s
ultimatum
ken
had
a
feeling
that
his
brother
knew
him
perfectly
and
he
was
divided
between
anger
and
amusement
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
lounged
in
the
lobby
the
proprietor
was
talking
with
some
americans
and
as
he
now
appeared
to
be
at
leisure
he
introduced
the
brothers
and
made
himself
agreeable
moreover
he
knew
george
alling
well
they
began
to
chat
and
ken
was
considerably
annoyed
to
hear
george
calmly
state
that
he
and
his
friends
intended
to
send
a
boat
up
to
valles
and
come
down
an
unknown
jungle
river
the
proprietor
laughed
and
though
the
laugh
was
not
unpleasant
somehow
it
nettled
ken
ward
why
not
go
he
asked
quietly
and
he
looked
at
the
hotel
man
my
boy
you
can
t
undertake
any
trip
like
that
why
not
persisted
ken
is
there
any
law
here
to
prevent
our
going
into
the
jungle
there
s
no
law
no
one
could
stop
you
but
my
lad
what
s
the
sense
of
taking
such
a
fool
trip
the
river
here
is
full
of
tarpon
right
now
there
are
millions
of
ducks
and
geese
on
the
lagoons
you
can
shoot
deer
and
wild
turkey
right
on
the
edge
of
town
if
you
want
tiger
and
javelin
go
out
to
one
of
the
ranches
where
they
have
dogs
to
hunt
with
where
you
ll
have
a
chance
for
your
life
these
tigers
and
boars
will
kill
a
man
there
s
all
the
sport
any
one
wants
right
close
to
tampico
i
don
t
see
how
all
that
makes
a
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
come
down
the
santa
rosa
replied
ken
we
want
to
explore
map
the
river
the
hotel
man
seemed
nettled
in
return
you
re
only
kids
it
d
be
crazy
to
start
out
on
that
wild
trip
it
was
on
ken
s
lips
to
mention
a
few
of
the
adventures
which
he
believed
justly
gave
him
a
right
to
have
pride
and
confidence
in
his
ability
but
he
forbore
it
s
a
fool
trip
continued
the
proprietor
you
don
t
know
this
river
you
don
t
know
where
you
ll
come
out
it
s
wild
up
in
that
jungle
i
ve
hunted
up
at
valles
and
no
native
i
ever
met
would
go
a
mile
from
the
village
if
you
take
a
mozo
he
ll
get
soaked
with
canya
he
ll
stick
a
knife
in
you
or
run
off
and
leave
you
when
you
most
need
help
nobody
ever
explored
that
river
it
ll
likely
be
full
of
swamps
sandbars
bogs
you
d
get
fever
then
the
crocodiles
the
boars
the
bats
the
snakes
the
tigers
why
if
you
could
face
these
you
d
still
have
the
ticks
the
worst
of
all
the
ticks
would
drive
men
crazy
let
alone
boys
it
s
no
undertaking
for
a
boy
the
mention
of
all
these
dangers
would
have
tipped
the
balance
for
ken
in
favor
of
the
santa
rosa
trip
even
if
the
hint
of
his
callowness
had
not
roused
his
spirit
thank
you
i
m
sure
you
mean
kindly
said
ken
but
i
m
going
to
valles
and
i
ll
come
down
that
jungle
river
indian
the
moment
the
decision
was
made
ken
felt
both
sorry
and
glad
he
got
the
excited
boys
outside
away
from
the
critical
and
anxious
proprietor
and
ken
decided
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
adopt
a
serious
and
responsible
manner
which
he
was
far
from
feeling
so
he
tried
to
be
as
cool
as
hiram
bent
with
a
fatherly
interest
in
the
two
wild
boys
who
were
to
accompany
him
down
the
santa
rosa
now
george
steer
us
around
till
we
find
a
mozo
said
ken
then
we
ll
buy
an
outfit
and
get
started
on
this
trip
before
you
can
say
jack
robinson
all
the
mozos
the
boys
interviewed
were
eager
to
get
work
however
when
made
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
trip
they
refused
point
blank
tigre
exclaimed
one
javelin
exclaimed
another
the
big
spotted
jaguar
of
the
jungle
and
the
wild
boar
or
peccary
were
held
in
much
dread
by
the
natives
these
natives
will
climb
a
tree
at
sight
of
a
tiger
or
pig
said
george
for
my
part
i
m
afraid
of
the
garrapatoes
and
the
pinilius
what
re
they
asked
hal
ticks
jungle
ticks
just
wait
till
you
make
their
acquaintance
finally
the
boys
met
a
named
pepe
who
had
often
rowed
a
boat
for
george
pepe
looked
sadly
in
need
of
a
job
still
he
did
not
ask
for
it
george
said
that
pepe
had
been
one
of
the
best
boatmen
on
the
river
until
the
fiery
white
liquor
to
which
the
natives
were
addicted
had
ruined
his
reputation
pepe
wore
an
old
sombrero
a
cotton
shirt
and
sash
and
ragged
trousers
he
was
barefooted
ken
noted
the
set
of
his
muscular
neck
his
brawny
shoulders
and
arms
and
appreciated
the
years
of
rowing
that
had
developed
them
but
pepe
s
haggard
face
deadened
eyes
and
listless
manner
gave
ken
pause
still
ken
reflected
there
was
never
any
telling
what
a
man
might
do
if
approached
right
pepe
s
dejection
excited
ken
s
sympathy
so
ken
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
with
george
acting
as
interpreter
offered
pepe
work
for
several
weeks
at
three
pesos
a
day
that
was
more
than
treble
the
wage
pepe
nearly
fell
off
the
canal
bridge
where
he
was
sitting
and
a
light
as
warm
and
bright
as
sunshine
flashed
into
his
face
si
señor
si
señor
he
began
to
jabber
and
waved
his
brown
hands
ken
suspected
that
pepe
needed
a
job
and
a
little
kind
treatment
he
was
sure
of
it
when
george
said
pepe
s
wife
and
children
were
in
want
somehow
ken
conceived
a
liking
for
pepe
and
believed
he
could
trust
him
he
thought
he
knew
how
to
deal
with
poor
pepe
so
he
gave
him
money
told
him
to
get
a
change
of
clothes
and
a
pair
of
shoes
and
come
to
the
hotel
next
day
he
ll
spend
the
money
for
canya
and
not
show
up
said
george
i
don
t
know
anything
about
your
natives
but
that
fellow
will
come
declared
ken
it
appeared
that
the
whole
american
colony
in
tampico
had
been
acquainted
with
ken
ward
s
project
and
made
a
business
to
waylay
the
boys
at
each
corner
they
called
the
trip
a
chase
they
declared
it
was
a
idea
and
could
hardly
take
ken
seriously
they
mingled
astonishment
with
amusement
and
concern
they
advised
ken
not
to
go
and
declared
they
would
not
let
him
go
over
and
over
again
the
boys
were
assured
of
the
peril
from
ticks
bats
boars
crocodiles
snakes
tigers
and
fevers
that
s
what
i
m
taking
the
trip
for
snapped
ken
driven
to
desperation
by
all
this
nagging
well
young
man
i
admire
your
nerve
concluded
the
hotel
man
if
you
re
determined
to
go
we
can
t
stop
you
and
there
s
some
things
we
would
like
you
to
find
out
for
us
how
far
do
tarpon
run
up
the
panuco
river
do
they
spawn
up
there
how
big
are
the
fish
i
ll
furnish
you
with
tackle
and
preserved
mullet
for
bait
we
ve
always
wondered
about
how
far
tarpon
go
up
into
fresh
water
keep
your
eye
open
for
signs
of
oil
also
look
at
the
timber
and
be
sure
to
make
a
map
of
the
river
when
it
came
to
getting
the
boat
shipped
the
boys
met
with
more
obstacles
but
for
the
friendly
offices
of
a
texan
an
employee
of
the
railroad
they
would
never
have
been
able
to
convince
the
native
shipping
agent
that
a
boat
was
merchandise
the
texan
arranged
the
matter
and
got
ken
a
freight
bill
he
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
ken
s
enterprise
compared
with
that
of
other
americans
and
in
a
cool
drawling
voice
which
somehow
reminded
ken
of
jim
williams
he
said
shore
will
have
the
time
of
your
lives
i
worked
at
valles
for
a
year
that
jungle
is
full
of
game
i
killed
three
big
tigers
want
to
look
out
for
those
big
yellow
devils
one
in
every
three
will
jump
for
a
man
there
s
nothing
but
shoot
then
and
the
wild
pigs
are
bad
they
put
me
up
a
tree
more
than
once
i
don
t
know
much
about
the
santa
rosa
its
source
is
above
micas
falls
never
heard
where
it
goes
i
know
it
s
full
of
crocodiles
and
rapids
never
saw
a
boat
or
a
canoe
at
valles
and
say
there
are
big
black
snakes
in
the
jungle
look
out
for
them
too
shore
have
sport
ken
thanked
the
texan
and
as
he
went
on
for
all
his
sober
thoughtfulness
he
was
as
eager
as
hal
or
george
however
his
position
as
their
guardian
would
not
permit
any
show
of
extravagant
enthusiasm
ken
bought
blankets
cooking
utensils
and
supplies
for
three
weeks
there
was
not
such
a
thing
as
a
tent
in
tampico
the
best
the
boys
could
get
for
a
shelter
was
a
long
strip
of
canvas
nine
feet
wide
that
ll
keep
off
the
wet
said
ken
but
it
won
t
keep
out
the
mosquitoes
and
things
couldn
t
keep
em
out
if
we
had
six
tents
replied
george
the
remainder
of
that
day
the
boys
were
busy
packing
the
outfit
pepe
presented
himself
at
the
hotel
next
morning
an
entirely
different
person
he
was
and
no
longer
disheveled
he
wore
a
new
sombrero
a
white
cotton
shirt
a
red
sash
and
blue
trousers
he
earned
a
small
bundle
a
pair
of
shoes
and
a
long
the
dignity
with
which
he
approached
before
all
the
other
was
not
lost
upon
ken
ward
a
sharp
scrutiny
satisfied
him
that
pepe
had
not
been
drinking
ken
gave
him
several
errands
to
do
then
he
ordered
the
outfit
taken
to
the
station
in
pepe
s
charge
the
boys
went
down
early
in
the
afternoon
it
was
the
time
when
the
were
returning
from
the
day
s
on
the
river
and
they
with
the
streamed
to
and
fro
on
the
platform
pepe
was
there
standing
guard
over
ken
s
outfit
he
had
lost
his
fame
among
his
old
associates
and
for
long
had
been
an
outsider
here
he
was
in
charge
of
a
pile
of
fine
guns
baggage
and
supplies
a
collection
representing
a
fortune
to
him
and
his
simple
class
he
had
been
trusted
with
it
it
was
under
his
eye
all
his
old
associates
passed
by
to
see
him
there
that
was
a
great
time
for
pepe
he
looked
bright
alert
and
supremely
happy
it
would
have
fared
ill
with
thieves
or
loafers
who
would
have
made
themselves
free
with
any
of
the
articles
under
his
watchful
eye
the
train
pulled
out
of
tampico
at
five
o
clock
and
hal
s
we
re
off
was
expressive
the
railroad
lay
along
the
and
the
broad
panuco
was
rippling
with
the
incoming
tide
if
ken
and
hal
had
not
already
found
george
to
be
invaluable
as
a
companion
in
this
strange
country
they
would
have
discovered
it
then
for
george
could
translate
pepe
s
talk
and
explain
much
that
otherwise
would
have
been
dark
to
the
brothers
wild
ducks
dotted
the
green
surface
and
spurts
showed
where
playful
were
breaking
water
great
tarpon
rolled
their
silver
sides
against
the
little
waves
white
cranes
and
blue
herons
stood
like
statues
upon
the
reedy
bars
low
down
over
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
a
long
line
of
wild
geese
winged
its
way
toward
a
shimmering
lagoon
and
against
the
gold
and
crimson
of
the
sunset
sky
a
flight
of
wild
fowl
stood
out
in
bold
black
relief
the
train
crossed
the
tamesi
river
and
began
to
draw
away
from
the
panuco
on
the
right
wide
marshes
gleaming
purple
in
the
darkening
light
led
the
eye
far
beyond
to
endless
pale
lagoons
birds
of
many
kinds
skimmed
the
weedy
flats
george
pointed
out
a
flock
of
aigrets
the
beautiful
wild
fowl
with
the
priceless
plumes
then
there
was
a
string
of
pink
flamingoes
tall
grotesque
wading
along
with
waddling
stride
feeding
with
heads
under
water
great
exclaimed
ken
ward
it
s
all
so
different
from
arizona
said
hal
at
tamos
twelve
miles
out
of
tampico
the
train
entered
the
jungle
thereafter
the
boys
could
see
nothing
but
the
impenetrable
green
walls
that
lined
the
track
at
dusk
the
train
reached
a
station
called
las
palmas
and
then
began
to
ascend
the
first
step
of
the
mountain
the
ascent
was
steep
and
when
it
was
accomplished
ken
looked
down
and
decided
that
step
of
the
mountain
was
between
two
and
three
thousand
feet
high
the
moon
was
in
its
first
quarter
and
ken
studying
this
tropical
moon
found
it
large
radiant
and
a
wonderful
it
shed
a
soft
luminous
glow
down
upon
the
sleeping
tangled
web
of
jungle
it
was
new
and
strange
to
ken
so
vastly
different
from
barren
desert
or
cañon
and
it
thrilled
him
with
nameless
charm
the
train
once
more
entered
jungle
walls
and
as
the
boys
could
not
see
anything
out
of
the
windows
they
lay
back
in
their
seats
and
waited
for
the
ride
to
end
they
were
due
at
valles
at
ten
o
clock
and
the
impatient
hal
complained
that
they
would
never
get
there
at
length
a
sharp
whistle
from
the
engine
caused
pepe
to
turn
to
the
boys
with
a
smile
valles
he
said
with
rattle
and
clank
the
train
came
to
a
halt
ken
sent
george
and
pepe
out
and
he
and
hal
hurriedly
handed
the
luggage
through
the
open
window
when
the
last
piece
had
been
passed
into
pepe
s
big
hands
the
boys
made
a
rush
for
the
door
and
jumped
off
as
the
train
started
say
but
it
s
dark
said
hal
as
the
train
with
its
lights
passed
out
of
sight
ken
found
himself
in
what
seemed
a
pitchy
blackness
he
could
not
see
the
boys
and
he
felt
a
little
cold
sinking
of
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
such
black
nights
on
an
unknown
jungle
river
iv
at
the
jungle
river
presently
as
ken
s
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
change
the
darkness
gave
place
to
pale
moonlight
a
crowd
of
chattering
natives
with
wide
sombreros
on
their
heads
and
blankets
over
their
shoulders
moved
round
the
little
stone
station
visitors
were
rare
in
valles
as
was
manifested
by
the
curiosity
aroused
by
the
boys
and
the
pile
of
luggage
ask
pepe
to
find
some
kind
of
lodging
for
the
night
said
ken
to
george
pepe
began
to
question
the
natives
and
soon
was
lost
in
the
crowd
awhile
after
as
ken
was
making
up
his
mind
they
might
have
to
camp
on
the
station
platform
a
queer
low
bus
drawn
by
six
little
mules
creaked
up
pepe
jumped
off
the
seat
beside
the
driver
and
began
to
stow
the
luggage
away
in
the
bus
then
the
boys
piled
in
behind
and
were
soon
bowling
along
a
white
moonlit
road
the
soft
voices
of
natives
greeted
their
passing
valles
appeared
to
be
about
a
mile
from
the
station
and
as
they
entered
the
village
ken
made
out
rows
of
thatched
huts
and
here
and
there
a
more
pretentious
habitation
of
stone
at
length
the
driver
halted
before
a
rambling
house
partly
stone
and
partly
thatch
there
were
no
lights
in
fact
ken
did
not
see
a
light
in
the
village
george
told
the
boys
to
take
what
luggage
each
could
carry
and
follow
the
guide
inside
the
house
it
was
as
dark
as
a
dungeon
the
boys
bumped
into
things
and
fell
over
each
other
trying
to
keep
close
to
the
barefooted
and
mysterious
guide
finally
they
climbed
to
a
kind
of
loft
where
the
moonlight
streamed
in
at
the
open
sides
what
do
you
think
of
this
panted
hal
who
had
struggled
with
a
heavy
load
of
luggage
pepe
and
the
guide
went
down
to
fetch
up
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
ken
thought
it
best
to
stand
still
until
he
knew
just
where
he
was
but
hal
and
george
began
moving
about
in
the
loft
it
was
very
large
and
gloomy
and
seemed
open
yet
full
of
objects
hal
jostled
into
something
which
creaked
and
fell
with
a
crash
then
followed
a
yell
a
jabbering
of
a
frightened
native
and
a
scuffling
about
hal
what
d
you
do
called
ken
severely
you
can
search
me
replied
hal
ward
one
thing
i
busted
my
shin
he
knocked
over
a
bed
with
some
one
sleeping
in
it
said
george
pepe
arrived
in
the
loft
then
and
soon
soothed
the
injured
feelings
of
the
native
who
had
been
so
rudely
disturbed
he
then
led
the
boys
to
their
cots
which
were
no
more
than
heavy
strips
of
canvas
stretched
over
tall
frameworks
they
appeared
to
be
enormously
high
for
beds
ken
s
was
as
high
as
his
head
and
ken
was
tall
for
his
age
say
i

never

up
into
this
thing
burst
out
hal
these
people
must
be
afraid
to
sleep
near
the
floor
george
why
are
these
cots
so
high
i
reckon
to
keep
the
pigs
and
dogs
and
all
that
from
sleeping
with
the
natives
answered
george
besides
the
higher
you
sleep
in
mexico
the
farther
you
get
from
creeping
crawling
things
ken
had
been
of
half
a
mind
to
sleep
on
the

but
george
s
remark
had
persuaded
him
to
risk
the
lofty
cot
it
was
most
awkward
to
climb
into

tried
several
times
without
success
and
once
he
just
escaped
a
fall
by

george

boys
if

shut
up
so
the
rest

can
ordered
ken
he
liked
the
sense
of
humor
and
the
good
fighting
spirit
of
the
boys
and
fancied
they
were
the
best
attributes
in
comrades
on
a
wild
trip
for
a
long
time
he
heard
a
kind
of
shuddering
sound
which
he
imagined
was
hal
s
cot
quivering
as
the
boy
laughed
then
absolute
quiet
prevailed
the
boys
slept
and
ken
felt
himself
drifting
when
he
awakened
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
holes
in
the
thatched
roof
pepe
was
up
and
the
other
native
sleepers
were
gone
ken
and
the
boys
descended
from
their
perches
without
any
tumbles
had
a
breakfast
that
was
palatable
although
even
george
could
not
name
what
they
ate
and
then
were
ready
for
the
day
valles
consisted
of
a
few
stone
houses
and
many
thatched
huts
of
bamboo
and
palm
there
was
only
one
street
and
it
was
full
of
pigs
dogs
and
buzzards
the
inhabitants
manifested
a
kindly
interest
and
curiosity
which
changed
to
consternation
when
they
learned
of
the
boys
project
pepe
questioned
many
natives
and
all
he
could
learn
about
the
santa
rosa
was
that
there
was
an
impassable
waterfall
some
few
kilometers
below
valles
ken
gritted
his
teeth
and
said
they
would
have
to
get
past
it
pepe
did
not
encounter
a
man
who
had
ever
heard
of
the
headwaters
of
the
panuco
river
there
were
only
a
few
fields
under
cultivation
around
valles
and
they
were
inclosed
by
impenetrable
jungle
it
seemed
useless
to
try
to
find
out
anything
about
the
river
but
pepe
s
advisers
in
the
village
told
enough
about
and
to
make
hal
s
hair
stand
on
end
and
george
turn
pale
and
ken
himself
wish
they
had
not
come
it
all
gave
ken
both
a
thrill
and
a
shock
there
was
not
much
conversation
among
the
boys
on
the
drive
back
to
the
station
however
sight
of
the
boat
which
had
come
by
freight
stirred
ken
with
renewed
spirit
and
through
him
that
was
communicated
to
the
others
the
hardest
task
so
far
developed
in
the
matter
of
transporting
boat
and
supplies
out
to
the
river
ken
had
hoped
to
get
a
handcar
and
haul
the
outfit
on
the
track
down
to
where
the
bridge
crossed
the
santa
rosa
but
there
was
no
then
came
the
staggering
information
that
there
was
no
wagon
which
would
carry
the
boat
and
then
worse
still
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
road
this
discouraged
ken
nevertheless
he
had
not
the
least
idea
of
giving
up
he
sent
pepe
out
to
tell
the
natives
there
must
be
some
way
to
get
the
outfit
to
the
river
finally
pepe
found
a
fellow
who
had
a
cart
this
fellow
claimed
he
knew
a
trail
that
went
to
a
point
from
which
it
would
be
easy
to
carry
the
boat
to
the
river
ken
had
pepe
hire
the
man
at
once
bring
on
your
old
cart
said
the
irrepressible
hal
that
cart
turned
out
to
be
a
remarkable
vehicle
it
consisted
of
a
narrow
body
between
enormously
high
wheels
a
trio
of
little
mules
was
hitched
to
it
the
driver
willingly
agreed
to
haul
the
boat
and
outfit
for
one
but
when
he
drove
up
to
the
platform
to
be
surrounded
by
neighbors
he
suddenly
discovered
that
he
could
not
possibly
accommodate
the
boys
patiently
pepe
tried
to
persuade
him
no
the
thing
was
impossible
he
made
no
excuses
but
he
looked
mysterious
george
tell
pepe
to
offer
him
five
pesos
said
ken
pepe
came
out
bluntly
with
the
inducement
and
the
driver
began
to
sweat
from
the
look
of
his
eyes
ken
fancied
he
had
not
earned
so
much
money
in
a
year
still
he
was
cunning
and
his
whispering
neighbors
lent
him
support
he
had
the
only
cart
in
the
village
and
evidently
it
seemed
that
fortune
had
come
to
knock
at
least
once
at
his
door
he
shook
his
head
ken
held
up
both
hands
with
fingers
spread
ten
pesos
he
said
the
driver
like
a
crazy
man
began
to
jabber
his
consent
the
boys
lifted
the
boat
upon
the
cart
and
tied
it
fast
in
front
so
that
the
stern
would
not
sag
then
they
packed
the
rest
of
the
outfit
inside
ken
was
surprised
to
see
how
easily
the
little
mules
trotted
off
with
such
a
big
load
at
the
edge
of
the
jungle
he
looked
back
toward
the
station
the
motley
crowd
of
natives
were
watching
making
excited
gestures
and
all
talking
at
once
the
driver
drove
into
a
narrow
trail
which
closed
behind
him
pepe
led
on
foot
brushing
aside
the
thick
foliage
ken
drew
a
breath
of
relief
as
he
passed
into
the
cool
shade
the
sun
was
very
hot
hal
and
george
brought
up
the
rear
talking
fast
the
trail
was
lined
and
overgrown
with
slender
trees
standing
very
close
making
dense
shade
many
birds
some
of
beautiful
coloring
flitted
in
the
branches
in
about
an
hour
the
driver
entered
a
little
clearing
where
there
were
several
thatched
huts
ken
heard
the
puffing
of
an
engine
and
looking
through
the
trees
he
saw
the
railroad
and
knew
they
had
arrived
at
the
and
the
bridge
over
the
santa
rosa
pepe
lost
no
time
in
rounding
up
six
natives
to
carry
the
boat
they
did
not
seem
anxious
to
oblige
pepe
although
they
plainly
wanted
the
money
he
offered
the
trouble
was
the
boat
at
which
they
looked
askance
as
in
the
case
with
the
driver
however
the
weight
and
clinking
of
added
silver
overcame
their
reluctance
they
easily
lifted
the
boat
upon
their
shoulders
and
as
they
entered
the
trail
making
a
strange
procession
in
the
foliage
they
encountered
two
natives
who
jumped
and
ran
yelling
la
diable
la
diable
what
ails
those
gazabos
asked
hal
they
re
scared
replied
george
they
thought
the
boat
was
the
devil
if
ken
needed
any
more
than
had
already
come
to
him
about
the
wildness
of
the
santa
rosa
he
had
it
in
the
frightened
cries
and
bewilderment
of
these
natives
they
had
never
seen
a
boat
the
santa
rosa
was
a
beautiful
wild
river
upon
which
boats
were
unknown
ken
had
not
hoped
for
so
much
and
now
that
the
die
was
cast
he
faced
the
trip
with
tingling
gladness
george
and
hal
you
stay
behind
to
watch
the
outfit
pepe
and
i
will
carry
what
we
can
and
follow
the
boat
i
ll
send
back
after
you
said
ken
then
as
he
followed
pepe
and
the
natives
down
the
trail
there
was
a
deep
satisfaction
within
him
he
heard
the
soft
rush
of
water
over
stones
and
the
mourning
of
turtledoves
he
rounded
a
little
hill
to
come
abruptly
upon
the
dense
green
mass
of
river
foliage
giant
bearded
with
gray
moss
fringed
the
banks
through
the
dark
green
of
leaves
ken
caught
sight
of
water
birds
rose
all
about
him
there
were
rustlings
in
the
thick
underbrush
and
the
whir
of
ducks
the
natives
penetrated
the
dark
shade
and
came
out
to
an
open
grassy
point
the
santa
rosa
glistening
green
swift
murmured
at
ken
s
feet
the
natives
dropped
the
boat
into
the
water
and
with
pepe
went
back
for
the
rest
of
the
outfit
ken
looked
up
the
shady
lane
of
the
river
and
thought
of
the
moment
when
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
in
the
train
then
as
much
as
he
had
longed
to
be
there
he
had
not
dared
to
hope
it
and
here
he
was
how
strange
it
was
just
then
to
see
a
large
black
duck
with
wings
sweep
by
as
swift
as
the
wind
ken
had
seen
that
wild
fowl
or
one
of
his
kind
and
it
had
haunted
him
first
in
less
than
an
hour
all
the
outfit
had
been
carried
down
to
the
river
and
the
boys
sat
in
the
shade
cooling
off
happily
conscious
that
they
had
made
an
auspicious
start
it
took
ken
only
a
moment
to
decide
to
make
camp
there
and
the
next
day
try
to
reach
micas
falls
the
mountains
appeared
close
at
hand
and
were
so
lofty
that
early
in
the
afternoon
as
it
was
the
westering
sun
hung
over
the
blue
summits
the
notch
where
the
santa
rosa
cut
through
the
range
stood
out
clear
and
at
most
it
was
not
more
than
eighteen
miles
distant
so
ken
planned
to
spend
a
day
pulling
up
the
river
and
then
to
turn
for
the
trip
come
boys
let
s
make
camp
said
ken
he
sent
pepe
with
his
long
into
the
brush
to
cut
hal
he
set
to
making
a
stone
fireplace
which
work
the
boy
rather
prided
himself
upon
doing
well
ken
got
george
to
help
him
to
put
up
the
strip
of
canvas
they
stretched
a
rope
between
two
trees
threw
the
canvas
over
it
and
pegged
down
the
ends
say
how
re
we
going
to
sleep
inquired
hal
suddenly
sleep
why
on
our
backs
of
course
retorted
ken
who
could
read
hal
s
mind
if
we
don
t
have
some
hot
old
times
keeping
things
out
of
this
tent
i
m
a
lobster
said
george
dubiously
i
m
going
to
sleep
in
the
middle
you
re
a
brave
boy
george
replied
ken
me
for
between
ken
and
pepe
added
hal
and
you
re
twice
as
brave
said
ken
i
dare
say
pepe
and
i
will
be
able
to
keep
things
from
getting
at
you
just
as
pepe
came
into
camp
staggering
under
a
load
of
wood
a
flock
of
ducks
swung
round
the
bend
they
alighted
near
the
shore
at
a
point
opposite
the
camp
the
way
george
and
hal
made
headers
into
the
pile
of
luggage
for
their
guns
gave
ken
an
inkling
of
what
he
might
expect
from
these
lads
he
groaned
and
then
he
laughed
george
came
up
out
of
the
luggage
first
and
he
had
a
rifle
which
he
quickly
loaded
and
fired
into
the
flock
he
crippled
one
the
others
flew
then
george
began
to
waste
shells
trying
to
kill
the
crippled
duck
hal
got
into
action
with
his
they
bounced
bullets
off
the
water
all
around
the
duck
but
they
could
not
hit
it
pepe
grew
as
excited
as
the
boys
and
he
jumped
into
the
boat
and
with
a
long
stick
began
to
pole
out
into
the
stream
ken
had
to
caution
george
and
hal
to
lower
their
guns
and
not
shoot
pepe
below
camp
and
just
under
the
bridge
the
water
ran
into
a
shallow
rift
the
duck
got
onto
the
current
and
went
round
the
bend
with
pepe
poling
in
pursuit
and
george
and
hal
yelling
along
the
shore
when
they
returned
a
little
later
they
had
the
duck
which
was
of
an
unknown
species
to
ken
pepe
had
fallen
overboard
george
was
wet
to
his
knees
and
though
hal
did
not
show
any
marks
of
undue
exertion
his
eyes
would
have
enlightened
any
beholder
the
fact
was
that
they
were
glowing
with
the
excitement
of
the
chase
it
amused
ken
he
felt
that
he
had
to
try
to
stifle
his
own
enthusiasm
there
had
to
be
one
old
head
in
the
party
but
if
he
did
have
qualms
over
the
possibilities
of
the
boys
to
worry
him
with
their
probable
escapades
he
still
felt
happy
at
their
boundless
life
and
spirit
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
the
heat
had
become
intense
ken
realized
it
doubly
when
he
saw
pepe
favoring
the
shade
george
and
hal
were
hot
but
they
appeared
to
be
too
supremely
satisfied
with
their
surroundings
to
care
about
that
during
this
hot
spell
which
lasted
from
three
o
clock
until
five
there
was
a
quiet
and
a
lack
of
life
around
camp
that
surprised
ken
it
was
slumberland
even
the
insects
seemed
drowsy
not
a
duck
and
scarcely
a
bird
passed
by
ken
heard
the
mourning
of
and
was
at
once
struck
with
the
singular
deep
full
tone
several
trains
crossed
the
bridge
and
at
intervals
the
engine
at
the
puffed
and
chugged
from
time
to
time
a
native
walked
out
upon
the
bridge
to
stare
long
and
curiously
at
the
camp
when
the
sun
set
behind
the
mountain
a
hard
breeze
swept
down
the
river
ken
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
and
at
first
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
storm
pepe
explained
that
the
wind
blew
that
way
every
day
after
sunset
for
a
while
it
tossed
the
willows
and
waved
the
spaniard
upon
the
cypresses
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
it
died
away
taking
the
heat
with
it
whereupon
the
boys
began
to
get
supper
george
do
you
know
anything
about
this
water
asked
ken
is
it
safe
george
supposed
it
was
all
right
but
he
did
not
know
the
matter
of
water
had
bothered
ken
more
than
any
other
thing
in
consideration
of
the
trip
this
was
cool
and
clear
it
apparently
was
safe
but
ken
decided
not
to
take
any
chances
and
to
boil
all
the
water
used
all
at
once
george
yelled
canvasbacks
and
made
a
dive
for
his
gun
ken
saw
a
flock
of
ducks
swiftly
winging
flight
hold
on
george
don
t
shoot
called
ken
let
s
go
a
little
slow
at
the
start
george
appeared
to
be
disappointed
though
he
promptly
obeyed
then
the
boys
had
supper
finding
the
russet
duck
much
to
their
taste
ken
made
a
note
of
pepe
s
capacity
and
was
glad
there
were
prospects
of
plenty
of
meat
while
they
were
eating
a
group
of
natives
gathered
on
the
bridge
ken
would
not
have
liked
to
interpret
their
opinion
of
his
party
from
their
actions
night
came
on
almost
before
the
boys
were
ready
for
it
they
replenished
the
and
sat
around
it
looking
into
the
red
blaze
and
then
out
into
the
flickering
shadows
ken
thought
the
time
propitious
for
a
little
lecture
he
had
to
give
the
boys
and
he
remembered
how
old
hiram
bent
had
talked
to
him
and
hal
that
first
night
down
under
the
great
black
of
the
grand
cañon
well
fellows
began
ken
we
re
started
we
re
here
and
the
trip
looks
great
to
me
now
as
i
am
responsible
i
intend
to
be
boss
i
want
you
boys
to
do
what
i
tell
you
i
may
make
mistakes
but
if
i
do
i
ll
take
them
on
my
shoulders
let
s
try
to
make
the
trip
a
great
success
let
s
be
careful
we
re
not
we
ll
not
kill
any
more
than
we
can
eat
i
want
you
boys
to
be
careful
with
your
guns
think
all
the
time
where
you
re
pointing
them
and
as
to
thinking
we
d
do
well
to
use
our
heads
all
the
time
we
ve
no
idea
what
we
re
going
up
against
in
this
jungle
both
boys
listened
to
ken
with
attention
and
respect
but
they
did
not
bind
themselves
by
any
promises
ken
had
got
out
the
expecting
any
moment
to
find
it
very
serviceable
however
to
his
surprise
it
was
not
needed
when
it
came
time
to
go
to
bed
hal
and
george
did
not
forget
to
slip
in
between
pepe
and
ken
the
tent
might
keep
off
rain
or
dew
but
for
all
the
other
protection
it
afforded
the
boys
might
as
well
have
slept
outside
nevertheless
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
ken
awoke
a
couple
of
times
during
the
night
and
rolled
over
to
find
a
softer
spot
in
the
hard
bed
these
times
he
heard
only
the
incessant
hum
of
insects
when
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
gray
morning
light
he
did
hear
something
that
made
him
sit
up
with
a
start
it
was
a
deep
booming
sound
different
from
anything
that
he
had
ever
heard
ken
called
pepe
and
that
roused
the
boys
listen
said
ken
in
a
little
while
the
sound
was
repeated
a
heavy
there
was
a
resemblance
to
the
first
strong
beats
of
a
drumming
grouse
only
infinitely
wilder
pepe
called
it
something
like
what
s
that
asked
hal
the
name
was
as
new
to
ken
as
the
noise
itself
pepe
explained
through
george
that
it
was
made
by
a
huge
black
bird
not
unlike
a
turkey
it
had
a
golden
plume
and
could
run
as
fast
as
a
deer
the
boys
rolled
out
all
having
conceived
a
desire
to
see
such
a
strange
bird
the
sound
was
not
repeated
almost
immediately
however
the
thicket
across
the
river
awoke
to
another
sound
as
much
a
contrast
to
the
boom
as
could
be
imagined
it
was
a
bird
medley
at
first
ken
thought
of
magpies
but
pepe
dispelled
this
illusion
with
another
name
hard
to
pronounce
chicalocki
he
said
and
that
seemed
just
like
what
they
were
singing
it
was
a
sharp
clear
song
and
to
judge
from
the
full
chorus
there
must
have
been
many
birds
they
re
a
land
of
pheasant
added
george
and
make
fine
the
ceased
their
salute
to
the
morning
and
then
as
the
river
mist
melted
away
under
the
rising
sun
other
birds
took
it
up
notes
new
to
ken
burst
upon
the
air
and
familiar
old
songs
thrilled
him
made
him
think
of
summer
days
on
the
susquehanna
the
sweet
carol
of
the
the
whistle
of
the
quail
the
mellow
sad
call
of
the
the
songs
blended
in
an
exquisite
harmony
why
some
of
them
are
our
own
birds
come
south
for
the
winter
declared
hal
it
s
music
said
ken
just
wait
laughed
george
it
dawned
upon
ken
then
that
george
was
a
fellow
who
had
the
mysterious
airs
of
a
prophet
hinting
dire
things
ken
did
not
know
what
to
wait
for
but
he
enjoyed
the
suggestion
and
anticipated
much
ducks
began
to
whir
by
flocks
of
blackbirds
alighted
in
the
trees
across
the
river
suddenly
hal
jumped
up
and
ken
was
astounded
at
a
great
discordant
screeching
and
a
sweeping
rush
of
myriads
of
wings
ken
looked
up
to
see
the
largest
flock
of
birds
he
had
ever
seen
parrots
he
yelled
indeed
they
were
and
they
let
the
boys
know
it
they
flew
across
the
river
wheeled
to
come
back
all
the
time
screeching
and
then
they
swooped
down
into
the
tops
of
the
said
george
just
wait
till
you
see
the
at
the
moment
the
were
quite
sufficient
for
ken
they
broke
out
into
a
chattering
screaming
cackling
discordance
it
was
plainly
directed
at
the
boys
these
intelligent
birds
were
curious
and
resentful
as
pepe
put
it
they
were
scolding
ken
enjoyed
it
for
a
full
and
reveled
in
the
din
that
morning
serenade
was
worth
the
trip
presently
the
parrots
flew
away
and
ken
was
surprised
to
find
that
most
of
the
other
birds
had
ceased
singing
they
had
set
about
the
business
of
the
day
something
it
was
nigh
time
for
ken
to
consider
breakfast
over
the
boys
broke
camp
eager
for
the
adventures
that
they
felt
to
be
before
them
now
for
the
big
job
boys
called
ken
any
ideas
will
be
welcome
but
don
t
all
talk
at
once
and
this
job
was
the
packing
of
the
outfit
in
the
boat
it
was
a
study
for
ken
and
he
found
himself
thanking
his
lucky
stars
that
he
had
packed
boats
for
trips
on
rapid
rivers
george
and
hal
came
to
the
fore
with
remarkable
advice
which
ken
was
at
the
pains
of
rejecting
and
as
fast
as
one
wonderful
idea
emanated
from
the
fertile
minds
another
one
came
in
at
last
ken
lost
patience
kids
it
s
going
to
take
brains
to
pack
this
boat
he
said
with
some
scorn
and
when
hal
remarked
that
in
that
case
he
did
not
see
how
they
ever
were
going
to
pack
the
boat
ken
drove
both
boys
away
and
engaged
pepe
to
help
the
boat
had
to
be
packed
for
a
long
trip
with
many
things
taken
into
consideration
the
very
best
way
to
pack
it
must
be
decided
upon
and
thereafter
held
to
strictly
balance
was
comfort
and
were
not
to
be
overlooked
a
flat
surface
easy
to
crawl
and
jump
over
was
absolutely
necessary
fortunately
the
boat
was
large
and
roomy
although
not
heavy
the
first
thing
ken
did
was
to
cut
out
the
narrow
here
he
packed
a
small
bucket
of
preserved
mullet
some
bottles
of
kerosene
and
and
a
lantern
the
small
flat
trunk
full
of
supplies
went
in
next
two
boxes
with
the
rest
of
the
supplies
filled
up
the
space
between
the
trunk
and
the
by
slipping
an
extra
pair
of
oars
coils
of
rope
the
ax
and
a
few
other
articles
between
the
gunwales
and
the
trunk
and
boxes
ken
made
them
fit
snugly
he
cut
off
a
piece
of
the
canvas
and
folding
it
he
laid
it
with
the
blankets
lengthwise
over
the
top
this
made
a
level
surface
one
that
could
be
gotten
over
quickly
or
a
place
to
sleep
for
that
matter
and
effectually
disposed
of
the
bow
half
of
the
boat
of
course
the
boat
sank
deep
at
the
bow
but
ken
calculated
when
they
were
all
aboard
their
weight
would
effect
an
even
balance
the
bags
with
clothing
ken
put
under
the
second
seat
then
he
arranged
the
other
piece
of
canvas
so
that
it
projected
up
back
of
the
stern
of
the
boat
he
was
thinking
of
the
waves
to
be
buffeted
in
going
stern
first
through
the
rapids
the
and
guns
he
laid
flat
from
seat
to
seat
last
of
all
he
placed
the
ammunition
on
one
side
next
the
gunwale
and
the
carrying
camera
films
medicines
on
the
other
come
now
fellows
called
ken
hal
you
and
george
take
the
second
seat
pepe
will
take
the
oars
i
ll
sit
in
the
stern
pepe
pushed
off
jumped
to
his
place
and
grasped
the
oars
ken
was
delighted
to
find
the
boat
trim
and
more
buoyant
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
we
re
off
cried
hal
and
he
whooped
and
george
exercised
his
already
faculty
of
imitating
hal
pepe
bent
to
the
oars
and
under
his
powerful
strokes
the
boat
glided
soon
the
bridge
disappeared
ken
had
expected
a
long
shady
ride
but
it
did
not
turn
out
so
shallow
water
and
gravelly
rapids
made
rowing
impossible
pile
out
boys
and
pull
said
ken
the
boys
had
dressed
for
wading
and
rough
work
and
went
overboard
with
a
will
pulling
at
first
was
not
hard
work
they
were
fresh
and
eager
and
hauled
the
boat
up
swift
shallow
channels
making
nearly
as
good
time
as
when
rowing
in
smooth
water
then
as
the
sun
began
to
get
hot
splashing
in
the
cool
river
was
pleasant
they
passed
little
islands
green
with
willows
and
came
to
high
gradually
wearing
away
and
then
met
with
rocky
restrictions
in
the
from
round
a
bend
came
a
hollow
roar
of
a
deeper
rapid
ken
found
it
a
incline
very
narrow
and
hard
to
pull
along
the
margin
of
the
river
was
hidden
and
obstructed
by
willows
so
that
the
boys
could
see
very
little
ahead
when
they
got
above
this
fall
the
water
was
deep
and
still
entering
the
boat
again
they
turned
a
curve
into
a
long
beautiful
stretch
of
river
ah
this
s
something
like
said
hal
the
green
shady
lane
was
alive
with
birds
and
ducks
of
various
kinds
rose
before
the
boat
white
blue
gray
and
speckled
herons
some
six
feet
tall
lined
the
low
bars
and
flew
only
at
near
approach
there
were
many
varieties
of
bitterns
one
kind
with
a
purple
back
and
white
breast
they
were
very
tame
and
sat
on
the
overhanging
branches
uttering
dismal
croaks
everywhere
was
the
flash
and
glitter
and
gleam
of
birds
in
flight
up
and
down
and
across
the
river
hal
took
his
camera
and
tried
to
get
pictures
the
strangeness
beauty
and
life
of
this
jungle
stream
absorbed
ken
he
did
not
take
his
guns
from
their
cases
the
water
was
bright
green
and
very
deep
here
and
there
were
the
swirls
of
playing
fish
the
banks
were
high
and
densely
covered
with
a
luxuriant
foliage
huge
leaned
across
the
river
giant
ceibas
spread
long
branches
thickly
tufted
with
aloes
orchids
and
other
jungle
parasites
lifted
slender
stems
and
graceful
heads
clumps
of
bamboo
spread
an
enormous
green
arch
out
over
the
banks
these
were
particularly
beautiful
to
ken
a
hundred
yellow
stems
grew
out
of
the
ground
close
together
and
as
they
rose
high
they
gracefully
leaned
their
bodies
and
drooped
their
tips
the
leaves
were
arrowy
exquisite
in
their
fineness
he
looked
up
the
long
bright
in
the
sun
dark
and
still
under
the
cypresses
at
the
turning
vines
and
blossoming
creepers
at
the
changeful
web
of
moving
birds
and
indulged
to
the
fullest
that
haunting
sense
for
wild
places
chicalocki
said
pepe
suddenly
a
flock
of
birds
resembling
the
pheasant
in
body
was
sailing
across
the
river
again
george
made
a
dive
for
a
gun
this
one
was
a
and
worn
out
he
shot
twice
at
the
birds
on
the
wing
then
pepe
rowed
under
the
overhanging
branches
and
george
killed
three
with
his
rifle
they
were
olive
green
in
color
and
the
long
tail
had
a
brownish
cast
heavy
and
plump
they
promised
fine
eating
pato
real
yelled
pepe
pointing
excitedly
up
the
river
several
black
fowl
as
large
as
geese
hove
in
sight
flying
pretty
low
ken
caught
a
glimpse
of
wide
wings
and
knew
then
that
these
were
the
birds
he
had
seen
load
up
and
get
ready
he
said
to
george
they
re
coming
fast
shoot
ahead
of
them
how
swift
and
powerful
they
were
on
the
wing
they
swooped
up
when
they
saw
the
boat
and
offered
a
splendid
target
the
little
rang
out
ken
heard
the
shot
strike
the
leader
stopped
in
midair
dipped
and
plunged
with
a
sounding
splash
ken
picked
him
up
and
found
him
to
be
most
beautiful
and
as
large
and
heavy
as
a
goose
his
black
feathers
shone
with
the
latent
green
luster
of
an
opal
and
the
pure
white
of
the
shoulder
of
the
wings
made
a
remarkable
contrast
george
we
ve
got
enough
meat
for
more
than
we
can
use
don
t
shoot
any
more
said
ken
pepe
resumed
rowing
and
ken
told
him
to
keep
under
the
overhanging
branches
and
to
row
without
splashing
he
was
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
oars
so
the
boat
glided
along
silently
ken
felt
he
was
rewarded
for
this
stealth
birds
of
rare
and
brilliant
plumage
flitted
among
the
branches
there
was
one
a
long
slender
bird
gold
and
black
with
a
white
ring
round
its
neck
there
were
little
kingfishers
no
larger
than
a
wren
and
great
kingfishers
with
blue
backs
and
tufted
heads
the
boat
passed
under
a
leaning
that
was
covered
with
orchids
ken
saw
the
slim
sharp
head
of
a
snake
dart
from
among
the
leaves
his
neck
was
as
thick
as
ken
s
wrist
what
kind
of
a
snake
pepe
whispered
ken
as
he
fingered
the
trigger
of
george
s
gun
but
pepe
did
not
see
the
snake
and
then
ken
thought
better
of
disturbing
the
silence
with
a
gunshot
he
was
reminded
however
that
the
texan
had
told
him
of
snakes
in
this
jungle
some
of
which
measured
more
than
fifteen
feet
and
were
as
large
as
a
man
s
leg
most
of
the
way
the
bank
was
too
high
and
steep
and
overgrown
for
any
animal
to
get
down
to
the
water
still
there
were
dry
gullies
or
arroyos
every
few
hundred
yards
and
these
showed
the
tracks
of
animals
but
pepe
could
not
tell
what
species
from
the
boat
often
ken
heard
the
pattering
of
hard
feet
and
then
he
would
see
a
little
cloud
of
dust
in
one
of
these
so
he
cautioned
pepe
to
row
slower
and
closer
in
to
the
bank
look
there
lem
me
out
whispered
hal
and
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
jumping
overboard
coons
said
george
oh
a
lot
of
them
there
some
young
ones
ken
saw
that
they
had
come
abruptly
upon
a
band
of
racoons
not
less
than
thirty
in
number
some
big
some
little
and
a
few
like
tiny
balls
of
fur
and
all
had
long
tails
what
a
scampering
the
big
ones
set
up
the
little
ones
were
frightened
and
the
smallest
so
tame
they
scarcely
made
any
effort
to
escape
pepe
swung
the
boat
in
to
the
bank
and
reaching
out
he
caught
a
baby
racoon
and
handed
it
to
hal
whoop
we
ll
catch
things
and
tame
them
exclaimed
hal
much
delighted
and
he
proceeded
to
tie
the
little
racoon
under
the
seat
sure
we
ll
get
a
whole
menagerie
said
george
so
they
went
on
often
ken
motioned
pepe
to
stop
in
dark
cool
places
under
the
canopy
of
bamboos
he
was
as
much
fascinated
by
the
beautiful
foliage
and
tree
growths
as
by
the
wild
life
hal
appeared
more
taken
up
with
the
fluttering
of
birds
in
the
thick
jungle
rustlings
and
soft
stealthy
steps
then
as
they
moved
on
ken
whispered
and
pointed
out
a
black
animal
vanishing
in
the
thicket
three
times
he
caught
sight
of
a
spotted
form
slipping
away
in
the
shade
george
saw
it
the
last
time
and
whispered
let
s
get
him
what
s
that
ken
a
kind
of
a
wildcat
asked
hal
yes
ken
took
george
s
and
tried
to
find
a
way
up
the
bank
there
was
no
place
to
climb
up
unless
he
dragged
himself
up
branches
of
trees
or
drooping
bamboos
and
this
he
did
not
care
to
attempt
encumbered
with
a
rifle
only
here
and
there
could
he
see
over
the
matted
roots
and
creepers
then
the
sound
of
rapids
put
hunting
out
of
his
mind
boys
we
ve
got
micas
falls
to
reach
he
said
and
told
pepe
to
row
on
the
long
stretch
of
deep
river
ended
in
a
wide
shallow
noisy
rapid
lined
the
banks
the
palms
cypresses
bamboos
and
the
flowery
mossy
growths
were
not
here
in
evidence
thickly
wooded
hills
rose
on
each
side
the
jungle
looked
sear
and
yellow
the
boys
began
to
wade
up
the
rapid
and
before
they
had
reached
the
head
of
it
pepe
yelled
and
jumped
back
from
where
he
was
wading
at
the
bow
he
took
an
oar
and
began
to
punch
at
something
in
the
water
at
the
same
time
calling
out
crocodile
cried
george
and
he
climbed
in
the
boat
hal
was
not
slow
in
following
suit
then
ken
saw
pepe
hitting
a
small
crocodile
which
lashed
out
with
its
tail
and
disappeared
come
out
of
there
called
ken
to
the
boys
we
can
t
pull
you
say
i
don
t
want
to
step
on
one
of
those
ugly
brutes
protested
hal
look
sharp
then
come
out
above
the
rapid
extended
a
stretch
where
pepe
could
row
and
beyond
that
another
long
rapid
when
the
boys
had
waded
up
that
it
was
only
to
come
to
another
it
began
to
be
hard
work
but
ken
kept
the
boys
buckled
down
and
they
made
fair
progress
they
pulled
up
through
eighteen
rapids
and
covered
distance
that
ken
estimated
to
be
about
ten
miles
the
blue
mountain
loomed
closer
and
higher
yet
ken
began
to
have
doubts
of
reaching
micas
falls
that
day
moreover
as
they
ascended
the
stream
the
rapids
grew
rougher
it
ll
be
great
coming
down
panted
hal
finally
they
reached
a
rapid
which
had
long
dinned
in
ken
s
ears
all
the
water
in
the
river
rushed
down
on
the
side
through
a
channel
scarcely
twenty
feet
wide
it
was
deep
and
swift
with
the
aid
of
ropes
and
by
dint
of
much
hard
wading
and
pulling
the
boys
got
the
boat
up
a
little
farther
on
was
another
bothersome
rapid
at
last
they
came
to
a
succession
of
falls
steps
in
the
river
that
barred
farther
advance
here
ken
climbed
up
on
the
bank
to
find
the
country
hilly
and
open
with
patches
of
jungle
and
palm
groves
leading
up
to
the
mountains
then
he
caught
a
glint
of
micas
falls
and
decided
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
there
he
made
what
observations
he
could
and
returned
to
camp
boys
here
s
where
we
stop
said
ken
it
ll
be
all
now
and
i
m
glad
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
boys
were
equally
glad
they
made
camp
on
a
grassy
bench
above
a
pool
ken
left
the
others
to
get
things
in
shape
for
supper
and
taking
his
camera
he
hurried
off
to
try
to
get
a
picture
of
micas
falls
he
found
open
places
and
through
the
brushy
forest
he
saw
evidences
of
forest
fire
and
then
knew
what
had
ruined
that
part
of
the
jungle
there
were
no
birds
it
was
farther
than
he
had
estimated
to
the
foothill
he
had
marked
but
loath
to
give
up
he
kept
on
and
finally
reached
a
steep
thorny
ascent
going
up
he
nearly
suffocated
with
heat
he
felt
rewarded
for
his
exertions
when
he
saw
micas
falls
glistening
in
the
distance
it
was
like
a
string
of
green
fans
connected
by
silver
ribbons
he
remained
there
watching
it
while
the
sun
set
in
the
golden
notch
between
the
mountains
on
the
way
back
to
camp
he
waded
through
a
flat
overgrown
with
coarse
grass
and
bushes
here
he
jumped
a
herd
of
deer
eight
in
number
these
small
sleek
gray
deer
appeared
tame
and
if
there
had
been
sufficient
light
ken
would
have
photographed
them
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
decide
not
to
fetch
his
rifle
but
as
he
had
meat
enough
in
camp
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
let
the
deer
go
when
he
got
back
to
the
river
pepe
grinned
at
him
and
pointing
to
little
red
specks
on
his
shirt
he
said
pinilius
aha
the
ticks
exclaimed
ken
they
were
exceedingly
small
not
to
be
seen
without
close
scrutiny
they
could
not
be
brushed
off
so
ken
began
laboriously
to
pick
them
off
pepe
and
george
laughed
and
hal
appeared
to
derive
some
sort
of
enjoyment
from
the
incident
say
these
ticks
don
t
bother
me
any
declared
ken
pepe
grunted
and
george
called
out
just
wait
till
you
get
the
big
fellows
the
garrapatoes
it
developed
presently
that
the
grass
and
bushes
on
the
contained
millions
of
the
ticks
ken
found
several
of
the
larger
ticks
almost
the
size
of
his
little
but
he
did
not
get
bitten
pepe
and
george
however
had
no
such
good
luck
as
was
manifested
at
different
times
by
the
time
they
had
cut
down
the
bushes
and
carried
in
a
stock
of
both
were
covered
with
the
little
pests
hal
found
a
spot
where
there
appeared
to
be
none
and
here
he
stayed
pepe
and
george
had
the
bad
habit
of
smoking
and
ken
saw
them
burning
the
ticks
off
and
using
the
fiery
end
of
their
cigarettes
this
feat
did
not
puzzle
ken
anything
like
the
one
where
they
held
the
red
point
of
the
cigarettes
close
to
their
naked
flesh
ken
and
hal
too
had
to
see
that
performance
at
close
range
why
do
you
do
that
asked
ken
popping
ticks
replied
george
he
and
pepe
were
as
sober
as
judges
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
soon
clear
to
ken
the
ticks
stuck
on
as
if
glued
when
the
hot
end
of
the
burning
cigarette
was
held
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
them
they
simply
blew
up
exploded
with
a
pop
ken
could
easily
distinguish
between
the
tiny
pop
of
an
exploding
and
the
heavier
pop
of
a
but
boy
while
you
re
taking
time
to
do
that
half
a
dozen
other
ticks
can
bite
you
exclaimed
ken
sure
they
can
replied
george
but
if
they
get
on
me
i
ll
kill
em
i
don
t
mind
the
little
ones
it
s
the
big
boys
i
hate
on
the
other
hand
pepe
seemed
to
mind
most
the
say
from
now
on
you
fellows
will
be
garrapato
george
and
pinilius
pepe
pretty
soon
you
ll
laugh
on
the
other
side
of
your
face
said
george
in
three
days
you
ll
be
popping
ticks
yourself
just
then
hal
let
out
a
yell
and
began
to
hunt
for
a
tick
that
had
bit
him
if
there
was
anything
that
could
bother
hal
ward
it
was
a
crawling
bug
of
some
kind
i
ll
have
to
christen
you
too
brother
said
ken
gurgling
with
mirth
a
very
felicitous
name
hollering
hal
despite
the
humor
of
the
thing
ken
really
saw
its
serious
side
when
he
found
the
grass
under
his
feet
alive
with
ticks
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
some
way
to
get
rid
of
them
and
he
hit
upon
a
remedy
on
the
ridge
above
the
bench
was
a
and
under
it
were
many
dead
palm
leaves
these
were
large
in
size
had
long
stems
and
were
as
dry
as
tinder
ken
lighted
one
and
it
made
a
flaming
hot
torch
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
scorch
all
the
ticks
near
that
camp
the
boys
had
supper
and
enjoyed
it
hugely
the
scene
went
well
with
the
and
they
gazed
out
over
the
foaming
pool
the
brawling
rapids
to
the
tufted
and
above
them
the
mountain
at
dusk
hal
and
george
were
so
tired
they
went
to
bed
and
at
once
dropped
into
slumber
pepe
sat
smoking
before
the
slumbering
fire
and
ken
chose
that
quiet
hour
to
begin
the
map
of
the
river
and
to
set
down
in
his
his
observations
on
the
mountains
and
in
the
valley
and
what
he
had
seen
that
day
of
bird
animal
and
plant
life
in
the
jungle
the
some
time
in
the
night
a
yell
awakened
ken
he
sat
up
clutching
his
revolver
the
white
moonlight
made
all
as
clear
as
day
hal
lay
deep
in
slumber
george
was
raising
himself
half
aroused
but
pepe
was
gone
ken
heard
a
thrashing
about
outside
leaping
up
he
ran
out
and
was
frightened
to
see
pepe
beating
and
clawing
and
tearing
at
himself
like
a
man
possessed
of
demons
pepe
what
s
wrong
shouted
ken
it
seemed
that
pepe
only
grew
more
violent
in
his
wrestling
about
then
ken
was
sure
pepe
had
been
stung
by
a
scorpion
or
bitten
by
a
snake
but
he
was
dumfounded
to
see
george
bound
like
an
apparition
out
of
the
tent
and
begin
evolutions
that
made
pepe
s
look
slow
hey
what
s
wrong
with
you
yelled
ken
george
was
as
grimly
silent
as
an
indian
running
the
gantlet
but
ken
thought
it
doubtful
if
any
indian
ever
slapped
and
tore
at
his
body
in
george
s
frantic
manner
to
add
to
the
mystery
hal
suddenly
popped
out
of
the
tent
he
was
yelling
in
a
way
to
do
justice
to
the
name
ken
had
lately
given
him
and
as
for
wild
and
whirling
antics
his
were
simply
marvelous
good
land
ejaculated
ken
had
the
boys
all
gone
mad
despite
his
alarm
ken
had
to
roar
with
laughter
at
those
three
dancing
figures
in
the
moonlight
a
rush
of
ideas
went
through
ken
s
confused
mind
and
the
last
prompted
him
to
look
in
the
tent
he
saw
a
wide
bar
of
black
crossing
the
moonlit
ground
the
grass
and
the
blankets
this
bar
moved
it
was
alive
bending
low
ken
descried
that
it
was
made
by
ants
an
army
of
jungle
ants
on
a
march
they
had
come
in
a
straight
line
along
the
base
of
the
little
hill
and
their
passageway
led
under
the
canvas
pepe
happened
to
be
the
first
in
line
and
they
had
surged
over
him
as
he
had
awakened
and
jumped
up
of
course
the
ants
had
begun
to
bite
the
same
in
turn
happened
to
george
and
then
hal
ken
was
immensely
relieved
and
had
his
laugh
out
the
stream
of
ants
moved
steadily
and
quite
rapidly
and
soon
passed
from
sight
by
this
time
pepe
and
the
boys
had
threshed
themselves
free
of
ants
and
into
some
degree
of
composure
say
you
nightmare
fellows
come
back
to
bed
said
ken
any
one
would
think
something
had
really
happened
to
you
pepe
snorted
which
made
ken
think
the
native
understood
something
of
english
and
the
boys
grumbled
loudly
ants
ants
as
big
as
wasps
they
bit
worse
than
helgramites
declared
hal
oh
they
missed
you
you
always
are
lucky
i
m
not
afraid
of
all
the
old
jaguars
in
this
jungle
but
i
can
t
stand
biting
crawling
bugs
i
wish
you
hadn
t
made
me
come
on
this
darn
trip
ha
ha
laughed
ken
just
wait
hal
put
in
george
grimly
just
wait
it
s
coming
to
him
the
boys
slept
well
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
owing
to
the
break
in
their
rest
did
not
awaken
early
the
sun
shone
hot
when
ken
rolled
out
a
creamy
mist
was
dissolving
over
the
curve
of
the
parrots
were
screeching
in
the
trees
after
breakfast
ken
set
about
packing
the
boat
as
it
had
been
done
the
day
before
i
think
we
ll
do
well
to
leave
the
trunk
in
the
boat
after
this
unless
we
find
a
place
where
we
want
to
make
a
permanent
camp
for
a
while
said
ken
before
departing
he
carefully
looked
over
the
ground
to
see
that
nothing
was
left
and
espied
a
heavy
which
george
had
baited
set
and
forgotten
hey
george
pull
up
your
it
looks
pretty
much
stretched
to
me
maybe
you
ve
got
a
fish
ken
happened
to
be
busy
at
the
boat
when
george
started
to
take
in
the
line
an
exclamation
from
pepe
george
s
yell
and
a
loud
splash
made
ken
jump
up
in
time
hal
also
came
running
george
was
staggering
on
the
bank
leaning
back
hard
on
the
heavy
line
a
long
angry
swirl
in
the
pool
told
of
a
powerful
fish
it
was
likely
to
pull
george
in
let
go
the
line
yelled
ken
but
george
was
not
letting
go
of
any
he
yelled
for
pepe
and
went
down
on
his
knees
before
pepe
got
to
him
both
then
pulled
on
the
line
the
fish
or
whatever
it
was
at
the
other
end
gave
a
mighty
jerk
that
almost
dragged
the
two
off
the
bank
play
him
play
him
shouted
ken
you
ve
got
plenty
of
line
give
him
some
hal
now
added
his
weight
and
strength
and
the
three
of
them
unmindful
of
ken
s
advice
hauled
back
with
might
and
main
the
line
parted
and
they
sprawled
on
the
grass
what
a
sockdologer
exclaimed
hal
i
had
that
hook
baited
with
a
big
piece
of
duck
meat
said
george
we
must
have
been
hooked
to
a
crocodile
things
are
happening
to
us
yes
so
i
ve
noticed
replied
ken
dryly
but
if
you
fellows
hadn
t
pulled
so
hard
you
might
have
landed
that
thing
whatever
it
was
all
aboard
now
we
must
be
on
the
move
we
don
t
know
what
we
have
before
us
when
they
got
into
the
boat
ken
took
the
oars
much
to
pepe
s
surprise
it
was
necessary
to
explain
to
him
that
ken
would
handle
the
boat
in
swift
water
they
shoved
off
and
ken
sent
one
regretful
glance
up
the
river
at
the
shady
aisle
between
the
green
banks
at
the
white
rapids
and
the
great
colored
dome
of
the
mountain
he
almost
hesitated
for
he
desired
to
see
more
of
that
mountain
but
something
already
warned
ken
to
lose
no
time
in
the
trip
down
the
santa
rosa
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
reason
for
hurry
yet
he
felt
it
necessary
but
he
asked
pepe
many
questions
and
kept
george
busy
interpreting
names
of
trees
and
flowers
and
wild
creatures
going
on
any
river
mostly
would
have
been
pleasure
but
drifting
on
the
swift
current
of
the
santa
rosa
and
rowing
under
the
wonderful
cypresses
was
almost
like
a
dream
it
was
too
beautiful
to
seem
real
the
smooth
stretch
before
the
first
rapid
was
short
however
and
then
all
ken
s
attention
had
to
be
given
to
the
handling
of
the
boat
he
saw
that
george
and
pepe
both
expected
to
get
out
and
wade
down
the
rapids
as
they
had
waded
up
he
had
a
surprise
in
store
for
them
the
rapids
that
he
could
not
shoot
would
have
to
be
pretty
bad
you
re
getting
close
shouted
george
warningly
with
two
sweeps
of
the
oars
ken
turned
the
boat
stern
first
then
dipped
on
the
low
green
incline
and
sailed
down
toward
the
waves
they
struck
the
first
wave
with
a
shock
and
the
water
flew
all
over
the
boys
pepe
was
tremendously
excited
he
yelled
and
made
wild
motions
with
his
hands
george
looked
a
little
frightened
hal
enjoyed
it
whatever
the
rapid
appeared
to
them
it
was
magnificent
to
ken
and
it
was
play
to
manage
the
boat
in
such
water
a
little
pull
on
one
oar
and
then
on
the
other
kept
the
stern
straight
the
channel
he
could
make
out
a
long
way
ahead
he
amused
himself
by
watching
george
and
pepe
there
were
stones
in
the
channel
and
the
water
rose
angrily
about
them
a
glance
was
enough
to
tell
that
he
could
float
over
these
without
striking
but
the
boys
thought
they
were
going
to
hit
every
stone
and
were
uneasy
all
the
time
twice
he
had
to
work
to
pass
ledges
and
sunken
trees
upon
which
the
current
bore
down
hard
when
ken
neared
one
of
these
he
dipped
the
oars
and
pulled
back
to
stop
or
lessen
the
momentum
then
a
stroke
turned
the
boat
half
broadside
to
the
current
that
would
force
it
to
one
side
and
another
stroke
would
turn
the
boat
straight
at
the
bottom
of
this
rapid
they
encountered
a
long
triangle
of
choppy
waves
that
they
bumped
and
splashed
over
they
came
through
with
nothing
wet
but
the
raised
flap
of
canvas
in
the
stern
pepe
regarded
ken
with
admiring
eyes
and
called
him
shooting
rapids
is
great
sport
proclaimed
george
they
drifted
through
several
little
rifts
and
then
stopped
at
the
head
of
the
narrow
chute
that
had
been
such
a
on
the
way
up
looked
at
from
above
this
long
narrow
channel
with
several
s
curves
was
a
fascinating
bit
of
water
for
a
canoeist
it
tempted
ken
to
shoot
it
even
with
the
boat
but
he
remembered
the
waves
at
the
bottom
and
besides
he
resented
the
importunity
of
the
spirit
of
daring
so
early
in
the
game
risk
and
perhaps
peril
would
come
soon
enough
so
he
decided
to
walk
along
the
shore
and
float
the
boat
through
with
a
rope
the
thing
looked
a
good
deal
easier
than
it
turned
out
to
be
through
at
the
narrowest
point
and
most
abrupt
curve
pepe
misunderstood
directions
and
pulled
hard
on
the
when
he
should
have
let
it
slack
the
boat
swung
in
nearly
smashing
ken
against
the
bank
and
the
sweeping
current
began
to
swell
dangerously
near
the
gunwale
let
go
let
go
yelled
ken
george
make
him
let
go
but
george
who
was
trying
to
get
the
rope
out
of
pepe
s
muscular
hands
suddenly
made
a
dive
for
his
rifle
deer
deer
he
cried
hurriedly
throwing
a
shell
into
the
chamber
he
shot
downstream
and
ken
looking
that
way
saw
several
deer
under
the
firs
on
a
rocky
flat
george
shot
three
more
times
and
the
bullets
went
spinging
into
the
trees
the
deer
bounded
out
of
sight
when
ken
turned
again
water
was
roaring
into
the
boat
he
was
being
pressed
harder
into
the
bank
and
he
saw
disaster
ahead
loosen
the
rope
tell
him
george
yelled
ken
pepe
only
pulled
the
harder
quick
or
we
re
ruined
cried
ken
george
shouted
in
spanish
and
pepe
promptly
dropped
the
rope
in
the
water
that
was
the
worst
thing
he
could
have
done
grab
the
rope
ordered
ken
wildly
grab
the
bow
don
t
let
it
swing
out
hal
before
either
boy
could
reach
it
the
bow
swung
out
into
the
current
ken
was
not
only
helpless
but
in
a
dangerous
position
he
struggled
to
get
out
from
where
the
swinging
stern
was
wedging
him
into
the
bank
but
could
not
budge
fearing
that
all
the
outfit
would
be
lost
in
the
river
he
held
on
to
the
boat
and
called
for
some
one
to
catch
the
rope
george
pushed
pepe
head
first
into
the
swift
current
pepe
came
up
caught
the
rope
and
then
went
under
again
the
boat
swung
round
and
now
half
full
of
water
got
away
from
ken
it
gathered
headway
ken
leaped
out
on
the
ledge
and
ran
along
with
the
boat
it
careened
round
the
bad
curve
and
shot
pepe
was
still
under
water
he
s
drowned
he
s
drowned
cried
george
hal
took
a
header
right
off
the
ledge
came
up
and
swam
with
a
few
sharp
strokes
to
the
drifting
boat
he
gained
the
bow
grasped
it
and
then
pulled
on
the
rope
ken
had
a
sickening
feeling
that
pepe
might
be
drowned
suddenly
pepe
appeared
like
a
brown
porpoise
he
was
touching
bottom
in
places
and
holding
back
on
the
rope
then
the
current
rolled
him
over
and
over
the
boat
drifted
back
of
a
rocky
point
into
shallow
water
hal
gave
a
haul
that
helped
to
swing
it
out
of
the
dangerous
current
then
pepe
came
up
and
he
too
pulled
hard
just
as
ken
plunged
in
the
boat
sank
in
two
feet
of
water
ken
s
grip
containing
camera
films
and
other
perishable
goods
was
on
top
and
he
got
it
just
in
time
he
threw
it
out
on
the
rocks
then
together
the
boys
lifted
the
boat
and
hauled
the
bow
well
up
on
the
shore
pretty
lucky
exclaimed
ken
as
he
flopped
down
doggone
it
yelled
hal
suddenly
and
he
dove
for
the
boat
and
splashed
round
in
the
water
under
his
seat
to
bring
forth
a
very
limp
and
drenched
little
racoon
good
he
s
all
right
said
ken
pepe
said
mucho
malo
and
pointed
to
his
shins
which
bore
several
large
bumps
from
contact
with
the
rocks
in
the
channel
i
should
say
mucha
malo
growled
george
he
jerked
open
his
grip
and
throwing
out
articles
of
wet
clothing
for
which
he
had
no
concern
he
gazed
in
dismay
at
his
whole
store
of
cigarettes
wet
by
the
water
so
that
s
all
you
care
for
said
ken
severely
young
man
i
ll
have
something
to
say
to
you
presently
all
hands
now
to
unpack
the
boat
fortunately
nothing
had
been
carried
away
that
part
of
the
supplies
which
would
have
been
affected
by
water
was
packed
in
tin
cases
and
so
suffered
no
damage
the
ammunition
was
waterproof
ken
s
parker
hammerless
and
his
automatic
rifle
were
full
of
water
and
so
were
george
s
guns
and
hal
s
while
they
took
their
weapons
apart
wiped
them
and
laid
them
in
the
sun
pepe
spread
out
the
rest
of
the
things
and
then
baled
out
the
boat
the
sun
was
so
hot
that
everything
dried
quickly
and
was
not
any
the
worse
for
the
wetting
the
boys
lost
scarcely
an
hour
by
the
accident
before
the
start
ken
took
george
and
pepe
to
task
and
when
he
finished
they
were
both
very
sober
and
quiet
ken
observed
however
that
by
the
time
they
had
run
the
next
rapid
they
were
enjoying
themselves
again
then
came
a
long
succession
of
rapids
which
ken
shot
without
anything
approaching
a
mishap
when
they
drifted
into
the
level
stretch
pepe
relieved
him
at
the
oars
they
glided
under
the
drooping
bamboo
under
the
silken
streamers
of
silvery
moss
under
the
dark
cool
bowers
of
matted
vine
and
blossoming
creepers
and
as
they
passed
this
time
the
jungle
silence
awoke
to
the
crack
of
george
s
and
the
discordant
cry
of
river
fowl
ken
s
guns
were
both
at
hand
and
the
rifle
was
loaded
but
he
did
not
use
either
he
contented
himself
with
snapping
a
picture
here
and
there
and
watching
the
bamboo
thickets
and
the
mouths
of
the
little
dry
ravines
that
ride
was
again
so
interesting
so
full
of
sound
and
action
and
color
that
it
seemed
a
very
short
one
the
murmur
of
the
water
on
the
rocks
told
ken
that
it
was
time
to
change
seats
with
pepe
they
drifted
down
two
short
rapids
and
then
came
to
the
gravelly
channels
between
the
islands
noted
on
the
way
up
the
water
was
shallow
down
these
rippling
channels
and
fearing
they
might
strike
a
stone
ken
tumbled
out
over
the
bow
and
wading
slowly
let
the
boat
down
to
still
water
again
he
was
about
to
get
in
when
he
espied
what
he
thought
was
an
alligator
lying
along
a
log
near
the
river
he
pointed
it
out
to
pepe
that
worthy
yelled
gleefully
in
mexican
and
reached
for
his
iguana
exclaimed
george
i
ve
heard
it
s
good
to
eat
the
reptile
had
a
body
about
four
feet
long
and
a
very
long
tail
its
color
was
a
steely
on
top
and
it
had
a
blunt
rounded
head
pepe
slipped
out
of
the
boat
and
began
to
wade
ashore
when
the
iguana
raised
itself
on
short
stumpy
legs
george
shot
at
it
and
missed
as
usual
but
he
effectually
frightened
the
reptile
which
started
to
climb
the
bank
with
much
nimbleness
pepe
began
to
run
brandishing
his
long
george
plunged
into
the
water
in
hot
pursuit
and
then
hal
yielded
to
the
call
of
the
chase
pepe
reached
the
iguana
before
it
got
up
the
bank
aimed
a
mighty
blow
with
his
and
would
surely
have
cut
the
reptile
in
two
pieces
if
the
blade
had
not
caught
on
an
overhanging
branch
then
pepe
fell
up
the
bank
and
barely
grasped
the
tail
of
the
iguana
pepe
hauled
back
and
pepe
was
powerful
the
frantic
creature
dug
its
feet
in
the
and
held
on
for
dear
life
but
pepe
was
too
strong
he
jerked
the
iguana
down
and
flung
it
square
upon
george
who
had
begun
to
climb
the
bank
george
uttered
an
awful
yell
as
if
he
expected
to
be
torn
asunder
and
rolled
down
with
the
reptile
on
top
of
him
ken
saw
that
it
was
as
badly
frightened
as
george
but
hal
did
not
see
this
and
he
happened
to
have
gained
a
little
below
the
bank
in
which
direction
the
iguana
started
with
wonderful
celerity
then
hal
made
a
jump
that
ken
believed
was
a
record
remarkably
awkward
as
that
iguana
was
he
could
surely
cover
ground
with
his
stumpy
legs
again
he
dashed
up
the
bank
pepe
got
close
enough
once
more
and
again
he
swung
the
the
blow
cut
off
a
piece
of
the
long
tail
but
the
only
effect
this
produced
was
to
make
the
iguana
run
all
the
faster
it
disappeared
over
the
bank
with
pepe
scrambling
close
behind
then
followed
a
tremendous
crashing
in
the
dry
thickets
after
which
the
iguana
could
be
heard
rattling
and
tearing
away
through
the
jungle
pepe
returned
to
the
boat
with
the
crestfallen
boys
and
he
was
much
concerned
over
the
failure
to
catch
the
big
lizard
which
he
said
made
fine
eating
what
next
asked
george
ruefully
and
at
that
the
boys
all
laughed
the
fun
is
we
don
t
have
any
idea
what
s
coming
off
said
hal
boys
if
you
brave
hunters
had
thought
to
throw
a
little
salt
on
that
lizard
s
tail
you
might
have
caught
him
added
ken
presently
pepe
espied
another
iguana
in
the
forks
of
a
tree
and
he
rowed
ashore
this
lizard
was
only
a
small
one
not
over
two
feet
in
length
but
he
created
some
excitement
among
the
boys
george
wanted
him
to
eat
and
hal
wanted
the
skin
for
a
specimen
and
ken
wanted
to
see
what
the
lizard
looked
like
close
at
hand
so
they
all
clamored
for
pepe
to
use
caution
and
to
be
quick
when
pepe
started
up
the
tree
the
iguana
came
down
on
the
other
side
quick
as
a
squirrel
then
they
had
a
race
round
the
trunk
until
pepe
ended
it
with
a
blow
from
his
hal
began
to
skin
the
iguana
ken
i
m
going
to
have
trouble
preserving
specimens
in
this
hot
place
he
said
salt
and
alum
will
do
the
trick
remember
what
old
hiram
used
to
say
replied
ken
shortly
after
that
the
boat
passed
the
scene
of
the
first
camp
and
then
drifted
under
the
railroad
bridge
hal
and
george
and
pepe
too
looked
as
if
they
were
occupied
with
the
same
thought
troubling
ken
that
once
beyond
the
bridge
they
would
plunge
into
the
jungle
wilderness
from
which
there
could
be
no
turning
back
first
the
santa
rosa
opened
out
wide
and
ran
swiftly
over
smooth
rock
deep
cracks
a
foot
or
so
wide
crossed
the
river
diagonally
and
fish
darted
in
and
out
the
boys
had
about
half
a
mile
of
this
when
after
turning
a
hilly
bend
they
entered
a
long
rapid
it
was
a
wonderful
stretch
of
river
to
look
down
by
george
said
ken
as
he
stood
up
to
survey
it
this
is
great
it
s
all
right
added
george
with
his
peculiar
implication
as
to
the
future
what
gets
me
is
the
feeling
of
what
might
be
round
the
next
bend
said
hal
this
indeed
ken
thought
made
the
fascination
of
such
travel
the
water
was
swift
and
smooth
and
shallow
there
was
scarcely
a
wave
or
ripple
at
times
the
boat
stuck
fast
on
the
flat
rock
and
the
boys
would
have
to
get
out
to
shove
off
as
far
ahead
as
ken
could
see
extended
this
wide
slant
of
water
on
the
left
rose
a
thick
line
of
huge
cypresses
all
festooned
with
gray
moss
that
drooped
to
the
water
on
the
right
rose
a
bare
bluff
of
crumbling
rock
it
looked
like
blue
clay
baked
and
cracked
by
the
sun
a
few
palms
fringed
the
top
say
we
can
beat
this
said
ken
as
for
the
twentieth
time
the
boys
had
to
step
out
and
shove
off
a
flat
shallow
place
two
of
you
in
the
bow
and
pepe
with
me
in
the
stern
feet
overboard
the
little
channels
ran
every
way
making
it
necessary
often
to
turn
the
boat
ken
s
idea
was
to
drift
along
and
keep
the
boat
from
grounding
by
an
occasional
kick
ken
manages
to
think
of
something
once
in
a
while
observed
hal
then
the
boat
drifted
whirling
round
and
round
here
pepe
would
drop
his
brown
foot
in
and
kick
his
end
clear
of
a
shallow
ledge
there
george
would
make
a
great
splash
when
his
turn
came
to
ward
off
from
a
rock
and
again
hal
would
give
a
greater
kick
than
was
necessary
to
the
righting
of
the
boat
probably
hal
was
much
influenced
by
the
fact
that
when
he
kicked
hard
he
destroyed
the
lazy
equilibrium
of
his
companions
it
dawned
upon
ken
that
here
was
a
new
and
unique
way
to
travel
down
a
river
it
was
different
from
anything
he
had
ever
tried
before
the
water
was
swift
and
seldom
more
than
a
foot
deep
except
in
diagonal
cracks
that
ribbed
the
this
long
stretch
appeared
to
be
endless
but
for
the
quick
gliding
movement
of
the
boat
which
made
a
little
breeze
the
heat
would
have
been
intolerable
when
one
of
hal
s
kicks
made
ken
lurch
overboard
to
sit
down
ludicrously
the
cool
water
sent
thrills
over
him
instead
of
retaliating
on
hal
he
was
glad
to
be
wet
and
the
others
soon
discovering
the
reason
for
ken
s
remarkable
went
overboard
and
lay
flat
in
the
cool
ripples
then
little
clouds
of
steam
began
to
rise
from
their
soaked
clothes
ken
began
to
have
an
idea
that
he
had
been
wise
in
boiling
the
water
which
they
drank
they
all
suffered
from
a
parching
thirst
pepe
scooped
up
water
in
his
hand
george
did
likewise
and
then
hal
you
ve
all
got
to
stop
that
ordered
ken
sharply
no
drinking
this
water
unless
it
s
boiled
the
boys
obeyed
for
the
hour
but
they
soon
forgot
or
deliberately
allayed
their
thirst
despite
ken
s
command
ken
himself
found
his
thirst
unbearable
he
squeezed
the
juice
of
a
wild
lime
into
a
cup
of
water
and
drank
that
then
he
insisted
on
giving
the
boys
doses
of
quinine
and
pills
which
treatment
he
meant
to
continue
daily
toward
the
lower
part
of
that
rapid
where
the
water
grew
deeper
fish
began
to
be
so
numerous
that
the
boys
kicked
at
many
as
they
darted
under
the
boat
there
were
thousands
of
small
fish
and
some
large
ones
occasionally
as
a
big
fellow
lunged
for
a
crack
in
the
rock
he
would
make
the
water
roar
there
was
a
fish
that
resembled
a
mullet
and
another
that
hal
said
was
some
kind
of
bass
with
a
blue
tail
pepe
chopped
at
them
with
his
george
whacked
with
an
oar
hal
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
shot
at
them
with
his
rifle
say
i
ve
got
to
see
what
that
bass
looks
like
said
ken
you
fellows
will
never
get
one
whereupon
ken
jointed
up
a
small
rod
and
putting
on
a
spinner
began
to
cast
it
about
he
felt
two
light
fish
hit
it
then
came
a
heavy
shock
that
momentarily
checked
the
boat
the
water
foamed
as
the
line
cut
through
and
ken
was
just
about
to
jump
off
the
boat
to
wade
and
follow
the
fish
when
it
broke
the
leader
that
was
a
fine
exhibition
remarked
the
critical
hal
what
s
the
matter
with
you
retorted
ken
who
was
sensitive
as
to
his
fishing
abilities
it
was
a
big
fish
he
broke
things
haven
t
you
got
a
reel
on
that
rod
and
fifty
yards
of
line
queried
hal
ken
did
not
have
another
spinner
and
he
tried
an
artificial
minnow
but
could
not
get
a
strike
on
it
he
took
hal
s
gun
and
shot
at
several
of
the
fish
but
though
he
made
them
jump
out
of
the
water
like
a
real
northern
it
was
all
of
no
avail
then
hal
caught
one
with
a
swoop
of
the
landing
net
it
was
a
beautiful
fish
and
it
did
have
a
blue
tail
pepe
could
not
name
it
nor
could
ken
classify
it
so
hal
was
sure
he
had
secured
a
rare
specimen
when
the
boat
drifted
round
a
bend
to
enter
another
long
wide
shallow
rapid
the
boys
demurred
a
little
at
the
sameness
of
things
the
bare
blue
bluffs
persisted
and
the
line
of
cypresses
and
the
strange
formation
of
five
more
miles
of
drifting
under
the
glaring
sun
made
george
and
hal
lie
back
in
the
boat
under
an
improvised
the
ride
was
novel
and
strange
to
ken
ward
and
did
not
pall
upon
him
though
he
suffered
from
the
heat
and
glare
he
sat
on
the
bow
occasionally
kicking
the
boat
off
a
rock
all
at
once
a
tense
whisper
from
pepe
brought
ken
round
with
a
jerk
pepe
was
pointing
down
along
the
shore
george
heard
and
raising
himself
called
excitedly
buck
buck
ken
saw
a
fine
deer
leap
back
from
the
water
and
start
to
climb
the
side
of
a
gully
that
indented
the
bluff
snatching
up
the
rifle
he
shoved
in
the
safety
catch
the
distance
was
far
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
but
without
elevating
the
sights
he
let
drive
a
cloud
of
dust
puffed
up
under
the
nose
of
the
climbing
deer
wow
yelled
george
and
pepe
began
to
jabber
hal
sprang
up
nearly
falling
overboard
and
he
shouted
give
it
to
him
ken
the
deer
bounded
up
a
steep
winding
trail
his
white
flag
standing
his
reddish
coat
glistening
ken
fired
again
the
bullet
sent
up
a
white
puff
of
dust
this
time
nearer
still
that
shot
gave
ken
the
range
and
he
pulled
the
automatic
again
and
again
each
bullet
hit
closer
the
boys
were
now
holding
their
breath
watching
waiting
ken
aimed
a
little
firmer
and
finer
at
the
space
ahead
of
the
deer
for
in
that
instant
he
remembered
what
the
old
hunter
on
penetier
had
told
him
and
he
pulled
the
trigger
twice
the
buck
plunged
down
slipped
off
the
trail
and
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
rolled
over
and
over
then
it
fell
sheer
into
space
and
whirled
down
to
strike
the
rock
with
a
sodden
crash
it
was
ken
s
first
shooting
on
this
trip
and
he
could
not
help
adding
a
cry
of
exultation
to
the
yells
of
his
admiring
comrades
guess
you
didn
t
plug
him
exclaimed
hal
ward
with
flashing
eyes
wading
the
boys
pulled
the
boat
ashore
pepe
pronounced
the
buck
to
be
very
large
but
to
ken
remembering
the
deer
in
coconino
forest
it
appeared
small
if
there
was
an
unbroken
bone
left
in
that
deer
ken
greatly
missed
his
guess
he
and
pepe
cut
out
the
haunch
least
crushed
by
the
fail
there
s
no
need
to
carry
along
more
meat
than
we
can
use
said
george
it
spoils
overnight
that
s
the
worst
of
this
jungle
i
ve
heard
hunters
say
hal
screwed
up
his
face
in
the
manner
he
affected
when
he
tried
to
imitate
old
hiram
bent
wal
youngster
i
reckon
i
m
right
an
down
proud
of
thet
shootin
you
air
comin
along
ken
was
as
pleased
as
hal
but
he
replied
soberly
well
kid
i
hope
i
can
hold
as
straight
as
that
when
we
run
up
against
a
jaguar
do
you
think
we
ll
see
one
asked
hal
just
you
wait
exclaimed
george
replying
for
ken
pepe
says
we
ll
have
to
sleep
in
the
boat
and
anchor
the
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
river
what
for
to
keep
those
big
yellow
tigers
from
eating
us
up
how
nice
replied
hal
with
a
rather
forced
laugh
so
talking
and
laughing
the
boys
resumed
their
journey
ken
who
was
always
watching
with
sharp
eyes
saw
buzzards
appear
as
if
by
magic
before
the
boat
was
half
a
mile
down
the
river
buzzards
were
circling
over
the
remains
of
the
deer
these
birds
of
prey
did
not
fly
from
the
jungle
on
either
side
of
the
stream
they
sailed
dropped
down
from
the
clear
blue
sky
where
they
had
been
invisible
how
wonderful
that
was
to
ken
nature
had
endowed
these
birds
with
wonderful
scent
or
instinct
or
sight
or
all
combined
but
ken
believed
that
it
was
power
of
sight
which
brought
the
buzzards
so
quickly
to
the
scene
of
the
killing
he
watched
them
circling
sweeping
down
till
a
curve
in
the
river
hid
them
from
view
and
with
this
bend
came
a
welcome
change
the
bluff
played
out
in
a
rocky
slope
below
which
the
green
jungle
was
relief
to
aching
eyes
as
the
boys
made
this
point
the
evening
breeze
began
to
blow
they
beached
the
boat
and
unloaded
to
make
camp
we
haven
t
had
any
work
but
we
re
all
tired
just
the
same
observed
ken
the
heat
makes
a
fellow
tired
said
george
they
were
fortunate
in
finding
a
grassy
plot
where
there
appeared
to
be
but
few
ticks
and
other
creeping
things
that
evening
it
was
a
little
surprise
to
ken
to
realize
how
sensitive
he
had
begun
to
feel
about
these
jungle
vermin
pepe
went
up
the
bank
for
ken
heard
him
slashing
away
with
his
then
this
sound
ceased
and
pepe
yelled
in
fright
ken
and
george
caught
up
guns
as
they
bounded
into
the
thicket
hal
started
to
follow
likewise
armed
ken
led
the
way
through
a
thorny
brake
to
come
suddenly
upon
pepe
at
the
same
instant
ken
caught
a
glimpse
of
gray
forms
slipping
away
in
the
jungle
pepe
shouted
out
something
exclaimed
george
ken
held
up
his
finger
to
enjoin
silence
with
that
he
stole
cautiously
forward
the
others
noiselessly
at
his
heels
the
thicket
was
lined
with
trails
and
by
following
these
and
stooping
low
it
was
possible
to
go
ahead
without
rustling
the
brush
owing
to
the
gathering
twilight
ken
could
not
see
very
far
when
he
stopped
to
listen
he
heard
the
faint
crackling
of
dead
brush
and
soft
quick
steps
he
had
not
proceeded
far
when
pattering
footsteps
halted
him
ken
dropped
to
his
knee
the
boys
knelt
behind
him
and
pepe
whispered
peering
along
the
trail
ken
saw
what
he
took
for
a
wildcat
its
boldness
amazed
him
surely
it
had
heard
him
but
instead
of
bounding
into
the
thicket
it
crouched
not
more
than
feet
away
ken
took
a
quick
shot
at
the
gray
huddled
form
it
jerked
stretched
out
and
lay
still
then
a
crashing
in
the
brush
and
gray
streaks
down
the
trail
told
ken
of
more
game
there
they
go
peg
away
at
them
called
ken
george
and
hal
burned
a
good
deal
of
powder
and
sent
much
lead
whistling
through
the
dry
branches
but
the
gray
forms
vanished
in
the
jungle
we
got
one
anyway
said
ken
he
advanced
to
find
his
quarry
quite
dead
it
was
bigger
than
any
wildcat
ken
had
ever
seen
the
color
was
a
grayish
yellow
almost
white
lined
and
spotted
with
black
ken
lifted
it
and
found
it
heavy
enough
to
make
a
good
load
he
s
a
beauty
said
hal
pepe
says
it
s
a
remarked
george
there
are
two
or
three
kinds
besides
the
big
tiger
we
may
run
into
a
lot
of
them
and
get
some
skins
it
was
almost
dark
when
they
reached
camp
while
pepe
and
hal
skinned
the
and
stretched
the
pelt
over
a
framework
of
sticks
the
other
boys
got
supper
they
were
all
very
hungry
and
tired
and
pleased
with
the
events
of
the
day
as
they
sat
round
the
there
was
a
constant
whirring
of
over
their
heads
and
an
incessant
hum
of
insects
from
the
jungle
ken
does
it
feel
as
wild
to
you
here
as
on
buckskin
mountain
asked
hal
oh
yes
much
wilder
hal
replied
his
brother
and
it
s
different
somehow
out
in
arizona
there
was
always
the
glorious
expectancy
of
s
fun
or
sport
here
i
have
a
kind
of
worry
a
feeling
but
he
concluded
it
wiser
to
keep
to
himself
that
strange
feeling
of
dread
which
came
over
him
at
odd
moments
it
suits
me
said
hal
i
want
to
get
a
lot
of
things
and
keep
them
alive
of
course
i
want
specimens
i
d
like
some
skins
for
my
den
too
but
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
killing
things
just
wait
retorted
george
who
evidently
took
hal
s
remark
as
a
reflection
upon
his
weakness
just
wait
you
ll
be
shooting
pretty
soon
for
your
life
now
george
what
do
you
mean
by
that
questioned
ken
determined
to
pin
george
down
to
facts
you
said
you
didn
t
really
know
anything
about
this
jungle
why
are
you
always
predicting
disaster
for
us
why
because
i
ve
heard
things
about
the
jungle
retorted
george
and
pepe
says
wait
till
we
get
down
off
the
mountain
he
doesn
t
anything
either
but
it
s
his
instinct
pepe
s
half
indian
so
i
say
too
wait
till
we
get
down
in
the
jungle
confound
you
where
are
we
now
queried
ken
the
real
jungle
is
the
lowland
there
we
ll
find
the
tigers
and
the
crocodiles
and
the
wild
cattle
and
wild
pigs
bring
on
your
old
pigs
and
things
replied
hal
but
ken
looked
into
the
glowing
embers
of
the
and
was
silent
when
he
got
out
his
and
began
his
drawing
he
forgot
the
worry
and
dread
in
the
interest
of
his
task
he
was
astonished
at
his
memory
to
see
how
he
could
remember
every
turn
in
the
river
and
yet
not
lose
his
sense
of
direction
he
could
tell
almost
perfectly
the
distance
traveled
because
he
knew
so
well
just
how
much
a
boat
would
cover
in
swift
or
slow
waters
in
a
given
time
he
thought
he
could
give
a
fairly
correct
estimate
of
the
drop
of
the
river
and
as
for
descriptions
of
the
jungle
life
along
the
shores
that
was
a
delight
all
except
trying
to
understand
and
remember
and
spell
the
names
given
to
him
by
pepe
ken
imagined
pepe
spoke
a
mixture
of
toltec
aztec
indian
spanish
and
english
the
white
upon
awakening
next
morning
ken
found
the
sun
an
hour
high
he
was
stiff
and
sore
and
thirsty
pepe
and
the
boys
slept
so
soundly
it
seemed
selfish
to
wake
them
all
around
camp
there
was
a
melodious
concourse
of
birds
but
the
parrots
did
not
make
a
visit
that
morning
while
ken
was
washing
in
the
river
a
troop
of
deer
came
down
to
the
bar
on
the
opposite
side
ken
ran
for
his
rifle
and
by
mistake
took
up
george
s
he
had
a
splendid
shot
at
less
than
one
hundred
yards
but
the
bullet
dropped
fifteen
feet
in
front
of
the
leading
buck
the
deer
ran
into
the
deep
bushy
willows
that
gun
s
leaded
muttered
ken
it
didn
t
shoot
where
i
aimed
pepe
jumped
up
george
rolled
out
of
his
blanket
with
one
eye
still
glued
shut
and
hal
stretched
and
yawned
and
groaned
do
i
have
to
get
up
he
asked
shore
lad
said
ken
mimicking
jim
williams
or
i
ll
hev
to
be
reconsiderin
that
idee
of
mine
about
you
bein
pards
with
me
such
mention
of
hal
s
ranger
friend
brought
the
boy
out
of
his
lazy
bed
with
amusing
alacrity
rustle
breakfast
now
you
fellows
said
ken
and
taking
his
rifle
he
started
off
to
climb
the
high
river
bluff
it
was
his
idea
to
establish
firmly
in
mind
the
trend
of
the
and
the
relation
of
the
river
to
it
the
difficulty
in
mapping
the
river
would
come
after
it
left
the
mountains
to
wind
away
into
the
wide
lowlands
the
matter
of
climbing
the
bluff
would
have
been
easy
but
for
the
fact
that
he
wished
to
avoid
contact
with
grass
brush
trees
even
dead
branches
as
all
were
covered
with
ticks
the
upper
half
of
the
bluff
was
bare
and
when
he
reached
that
part
he
soon
surmounted
it
ken
faced
south
with
something
of
eagerness
fortunately
the
mist
had
dissolved
under
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
affording
an
unobstructed
view
that
scene
was
wild
and
haunting
yet
different
from
what
his
fancy
had
pictured
the
great
expanse
of
jungle
was
gray
the
green
line
of
cypress
palm
and
bamboo
following
the
southward
course
of
the
river
the
some
ten
miles
distant
sloped
to
the
south
and
faded
away
in
the
haze
the
river
disappeared
in
rich
dark
verdure
and
but
for
it
which
afforded
a
back
to
civilization
ken
would
have
been
lost
in
a
dense
overgrowth
of
tropical
wilderness
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
caught
the
faint
roar
of
a
waterfall
on
the
morning
breeze
yet
could
not
be
sure
and
he
returned
toward
camp
with
a
sober
appreciation
of
the
difficulty
of
his
enterprise
and
a
more
thrilling
sense
of
its
hazard
and
charm
didn
t
see
anything
to
peg
at
eh
greeted
hal
well
get
your
teeth
in
some
of
this
venison
before
it
s
all
gone
soon
they
were
under
way
again
pepe
strong
and
willing
at
the
oars
this
time
ken
had
his
rifle
and
shotgun
close
at
hand
ready
for
use
half
a
mile
below
the
river
running
still
and
deep
entered
a
shaded
waterway
so
narrow
that
in
places
the
branches
of
and
leaning
cypresses
met
and
intertwined
their
foliage
this
lane
was
a
paradise
for
birds
that
ranged
from
huge
speckled
cranes
six
feet
high
to
little
yellow
birds
almost
too
small
to
see
black
squirrels
were
numerous
and
very
tame
in
fact
all
the
creatures
along
this
shaded
stream
were
so
fearless
that
it
was
easy
to
see
they
had
never
heard
a
shot
ken
awoke
sleepy
cranes
with
his
and
once
pushed
a
blue
heron
off
a
log
he
heard
animals
of
some
species
running
back
from
the
bank
out
could
not
see
them
all
at
once
a
soft
breeze
coming
bore
a
deep
roar
of
tumbling
rapids
the
sensation
of
dread
which
had
bothered
ken
occasionally
now
returned
and
fixed
itself
in
his
mind
he
was
in
the
jungle
of
mexico
and
knew
not
what
lay
ahead
of
him
but
if
he
had
been
in
the
wilds
of
unexplored
brazil
and
had
heard
that
roar
it
would
have
been
familiar
to
him
in
his
canoe
experience
on
the
swift
streams
of
pennsylvania
ken
ward
had
learned
long
before
he
came
to
rapids
to
judge
what
they
were
from
the
sound
his
attention
wandered
from
the
beautiful
birds
the
bowers
and
the
overhanging
jungle
he
listened
to
the
heavy
sullen
roar
of
the
rapids
that
water
sounds
different
remarked
george
grande
said
pepe
with
a
smile
pretty
heavy
ken
eh
asked
hal
looking
quickly
at
his
brother
but
ken
ward
made
his
face
a
mask
and
betrayed
nothing
of
the
grim
nature
of
his
thought
pepe
and
the
boys
had
little
idea
of
danger
and
they
had
now
a
blind
faith
in
ken
i
dare
say
we
ll
get
used
to
that
roar
replied
ken
easily
and
he
began
to
pack
his
guns
away
in
their
cases
hal
forgot
his
momentary
anxiety
pepe
rowed
on
leisurely
and
george
lounged
in
his
seat
there
was
no
menace
for
them
in
that
dull
continuous
roar
but
ken
knew
they
would
soon
be
in
fast
water
and
before
long
would
drop
down
into
the
real
wilderness
it
was
not
now
too
late
to
go
back
up
the
river
but
soon
that
would
be
impossible
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
ahead
ken
revolved
in
mind
the
necessity
for
caution
and
skilful
handling
of
the
boat
but
he
realized
too
that
overzealousness
on
the
side
of
caution
was
a
worse
thing
for
such
a
trip
than
sheer
recklessness
good
judgment
in
looking
over
rapids
a
quick
eye
to
pick
the
best
channel
then
a
daring
spirit
that
was
the
ideal
to
be
striven
for
in
going
down
swift
rivers
presently
ken
saw
a
break
in
the
level
surface
of
the
water
he
took
pepe
s
place
at
the
oars
and
as
usual
turned
the
boat
stern
first
the
banks
were
low
and
shelved
out
in
rocky
points
this
relieved
ken
for
he
saw
that
he
could
land
just
above
the
falls
what
he
feared
was
a
narrow
gorge
impossible
to
portage
round
or
go
through
as
the
boat
approached
the
break
the
roar
seemed
to
divide
itself
hollow
and
shallow
near
at
hand
rushing
and
heavy
farther
on
ken
rowed
close
to
the
bank
and
landed
on
the
first
strip
of
rock
he
got
out
and
walking
along
this
ledge
soon
reached
the
fall
it
was
a
straight
drop
of
some
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
the
water
was
shallow
all
the
way
across
boys
this
is
easy
said
ken
we
ll
pack
the
outfit
round
the
fall
and
slide
the
boat
over
but
ken
did
not
say
anything
about
the
white
water
extending
below
the
fall
as
far
as
he
could
see
from
here
came
the
sullen
roar
that
had
worried
him
portaging
the
supplies
around
that
place
turned
out
to
be
far
from
easy
the
portage
was
not
long
nor
rugged
but
the
cracked
rock
made
going
very
difficult
the
boys
often
stumbled
pepe
fell
and
broke
open
a
box
and
almost
broke
his
leg
ken
had
a
hard
knock
then
when
it
came
to
carrying
the
trunk
one
at
each
corner
progress
was
laborious
and
annoying
full
two
hours
were
lost
in
transporting
the
outfit
around
the
fall
below
there
was
a
wide
shelving
apron
over
which
the
water
ran
a
foot
or
so
in
depth
ken
stationed
pepe
and
the
boys
there
and
went
up
to
get
the
boat
he
waded
out
with
it
ken
saw
that
his
end
of
this
business
was
going
to
be
simple
enough
but
he
had
doubts
as
to
what
would
happen
to
the
boys
brace
yourselves
now
he
yelled
when
i
drop
her
over
she
ll
come
hang
on
if
she
drags
you
a
mile
wading
out
deeper
ken
let
the
boat
swing
down
with
the
current
till
the
stern
projected
over
the
fall
he
had
trouble
in
keeping
his
footing
for
the
rock
was
slippery
then
with
a
yell
he
ran
the
stern
far
out
over
the
drop
bore
down
hard
on
the
bow
and
shoved
off
the
boat
shot
out
and
down
to
alight
with
a
heavy
souse
then
it
leaped
into
the
swift
current
george
got
his
hands
on
it
first
and
went
down
like
a
ninepin
the
boat
floated
over
him
the
bow
struck
hal
and
would
have
dragged
him
away
had
not
pepe
laid
powerful
hands
on
the
stern
they
waded
to
the
lower
ledge
didn
t
ship
a
bucketful
said
hal
fine
work
ken
i
got
all
the
water
added
the
drenched
and
dripping
george
bail
out
boys
and
repack
while
i
look
below
said
ken
he
went
a
little
way
to
take
a
survey
of
the
rapids
if
those
rapids
had
been
back
in
pennsylvania
ken
felt
that
he
could
have
gone
at
them
in
delight
if
the
jungle
country
had
been
such
that
damage
to
boat
or
supplies
could
have
been
remedied
or
replaced
these
rapids
would
not
have
appeared
so
bad
ken
walked
up
and
down
looking
over
the
long
white
inclines
more
than
was
wise
and
he
hesitated
about
going
into
them
but
it
had
to
be
done
so
he
went
back
to
the
boys
then
he
took
the
oars
with
gripping
fingers
george
can
you
swim
he
asked
i
m
a
second
cousin
to
a
fish
replied
george
all
right
we
re
off
now
if
we
upset
hang
to
the
boat
if
you
can
and
hold
up
your
legs
george
tell
pepe
ken
backed
the
boat
out
from
the
shore
to
his
right
in
the
middle
of
the
narrow
river
was
a
racy
current
that
he
kept
out
of
as
long
as
possible
but
presently
he
was
drawn
into
it
and
the
boat
shot
forward
headed
into
the
first
incline
and
went
racing
smoothly
down
toward
the
white
waves
of
the
rapids
this
was
a
trying
moment
for
ken
grip
as
hard
as
he
might
the
slipped
in
his
sweaty
hands
the
boys
were
yelling
but
ken
could
not
hear
for
the
din
of
roaring
waters
the
boat
sailed
down
with
swift
gliding
motion
when
it
thumped
into
the
of
the
first
big
waves
the
water
threshed
around
and
over
the
boys
then
they
were
in
the
thick
of
rush
and
roar
ken
knew
he
was
not
handling
the
boat
well
it
grazed
stones
that
should
have
been
easy
to
avoid
and
bumped
on
hidden
ones
and
got
half
broadside
to
the
current
pepe
by
quick
action
with
an
oar
pushed
the
stern
aside
from
collision
with
more
than
one
rock
several
times
ken
missed
a
stroke
when
a
powerful
one
was
needed
he
passed
between
stones
so
close
together
that
he
had
to
ship
the
oars
it
was
all
rapid
water
this
stretch
but
the
bad
places
with
sunken
rocks
falls
and
big
waves
were
strung
out
at
such
distances
apart
that
ken
had
time
to
get
the
boat
going
right
before
entering
them
ken
saw
scarcely
anything
of
the
banks
of
the
river
they
blurred
in
his
sight
sometimes
they
were
near
sometimes
far
the
boat
turned
corners
where
rocky
ledges
pointed
out
constricting
the
stream
and
making
a
curved
channel
what
lay
around
the
curve
was
always
a
question
and
a
cause
for
suspense
often
the
boat
raced
down
a
chute
and
straight
toward
a
rocky
wall
ken
would
pull
back
with
all
his
might
and
pepe
would
break
the
shock
by
striking
the
wall
with
his
oar
more
than
once
pepe
had
a
narrow
escape
from
being
knocked
overboard
george
tried
to
keep
him
from
standing
up
finally
at
the
end
of
a
long
rapid
pepe
who
had
the
jumped
up
and
yelled
ken
saw
a
stone
directly
in
the
path
of
the
boat
and
he
pulled
back
on
the
oars
with
a
quick
strong
jerk
pepe
shot
out
of
the
stern
as
if
he
had
been
flung
from
a
catapult
he
swam
with
the
current
while
the
boat
drifted
he
reached
smooth
water
and
the
shore
before
ken
could
pick
him
up
it
was
fun
for
everybody
but
ken
there
were
three
inches
of
water
in
the
boat
the
canvas
however
had
been
arranged
to
protect
guns
grips
and
supplies
george
had
been
wet
before
he
entered
the
rapids
so
a
little
additional
water
did
not
matter
to
him
hal
was
almost
as
wet
as
pepe
i
m
glad
that
s
past
said
ken
with
that
long
rapid
behind
him
he
felt
different
it
was
what
he
had
needed
his
nervousness
disappeared
and
he
had
no
dread
of
the
next
fall
while
the
boys
bailed
out
the
boat
ken
rested
and
thought
he
had
made
mistakes
in
that
rapid
just
passed
luck
had
favored
him
he
went
over
the
mistakes
and
saw
where
he
had
been
wrong
and
how
he
could
have
avoided
them
if
he
had
felt
right
ken
realized
now
that
this
was
a
daredevil
trip
and
the
daredevil
in
him
had
been
shut
up
in
dread
it
took
just
that
nervous
dread
and
the
hard
work
blunders
and
accidents
the
danger
and
luck
to
liberate
the
spirit
that
would
make
the
trip
a
success
pepe
and
george
were
loud
in
their
praises
of
ken
but
they
did
not
appreciate
the
real
hazard
of
the
undertaking
and
if
hal
did
he
was
too
much
of
a
wild
boy
to
care
all
aboard
called
george
then
they
were
on
their
way
again
ken
found
himself
listening
for
rapids
it
was
no
surprise
to
hear
a
dull
roar
round
the
next
bend
his
hair
rose
stiffly
under
his
hat
but
this
time
he
did
not
feel
the
chill
the
uncertainty
the
lack
of
confidence
that
had
before
weakened
him
at
the
head
of
a
long
shallow
incline
the
boys
tumbled
overboard
ken
and
hal
at
the
bow
pepe
and
george
at
the
stern
they
waded
with
the
bow
the
water
tore
around
their
legs
rising
higher
and
higher
soon
pepe
and
george
had
to
climb
in
the
boat
for
the
water
became
so
deep
and
swift
they
could
not
wade
jump
in
hal
called
ken
then
he
held
to
the
bow
an
instant
longer
wading
a
little
farther
down
this
was
ticklish
business
and
all
depended
upon
ken
he
got
the
stern
of
the
boat
straight
in
line
with
the
channel
he
wanted
to
run
then
he
leaped
aboard
and
made
for
the
oars
the
boat
sped
down
at
the
bottom
of
this
incline
was
a
mass
of
leaping
green
and
white
waves
the
blunt
stern
of
the
boat
made
a
great
splash
and
the
water
flew
over
the
boys
they
came
through
the
roar
and
hiss
and
spray
to
glide
into
a
current
never
saw
such
swift
water
exclaimed
ken
this
incline
ended
in
a
sullen
plunge
between
two
huge
rocks
ken
saw
the
danger
long
before
it
became
evident
to
his
companions
there
was
no
other
way
to
shoot
the
rapid
he
could
not
reach
the
shore
he
must
pass
between
the
rocks
ken
pushed
on
one
oar
then
on
the
other
till
he
got
the
boat
in
line
and
then
he
pushed
with
both
oars
the
boat
flew
down
that
incline
it
went
so
swiftly
that
if
it
had
hit
one
of
the
rocks
it
would
have
been
smashed
to
kindling
wood
hal
crouched
low
george
s
face
was
white
and
pepe
leaned
forward
with
his
big
arms
outstretched
ready
to
try
to
prevent
a
collision
down
down
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
the
boat
flashed
between
the
black
stones
then
it
was
raised
aloft
light
as
a
feather
to
crash
into
the
the
din
deafened
ken
the
spray
blinded
him
the
boat
seemed
to
split
a
white
pall
of
water
then
with
many
a
bounce
drifted
out
of
that
rapid
into
little
choppy
waves
and
from
them
into
another
long
smooth
runway
ken
rested
and
had
nothing
to
say
pepe
shook
his
black
head
hal
looked
at
his
brother
george
had
forgotten
his
rifle
no
one
spoke
soon
ken
had
more
work
on
hand
for
round
another
corner
lay
more
fast
water
the
boat
dipped
on
a
low
fall
and
went
down
into
the
midst
of
green
waves
with
here
and
there
ugly
rocks
splitting
the
current
the
was
continually
new
and
strange
to
ken
and
he
had
never
seen
such
queer
formation
of
rocks
this
rapid
however
was
easy
to
navigate
a
slanting
channel
of
swift
water
connected
it
with
another
rapid
ken
backed
into
that
one
passed
through
only
to
face
another
and
so
it
went
for
a
long
succession
of
shallow
rapids
a
turn
in
the
winding
lane
of
cypresses
revealed
walls
of
gray
between
which
the
river
disappeared
aha
muttered
ken
ken
i
ll
bet
this
is
the
place
you
ve
been
looking
for
said
hal
the
absence
of
any
roar
of
water
emboldened
ken
nearing
the
head
of
the
ravine
he
stood
upon
the
seat
and
looked
ahead
but
ken
could
not
see
many
rods
ahead
the
ravine
turned
and
it
was
the
deceiving
turns
in
the
river
that
he
had
feared
what
a
strange
sensation
ken
had
when
he
backed
the
boat
into
the
mouth
of
that
gorge
he
was
forced
against
his
will
yet
there
seemed
to
be
a
kind
of
pleasure
in
the
prospect
the
current
caught
the
boat
and
drew
it
between
the
walls
of
rock
it
s
coming
to
us
said
the
doubtful
george
the
current
ran
all
of
six
miles
an
hour
this
was
not
half
as
fast
as
the
boys
had
traveled
in
rapids
but
it
appeared
swift
enough
because
of
the
nearness
of
the
overshadowing
walls
in
the
shade
the
water
took
on
a
different
coloring
it
was
brown
and
oily
it
slid
along
silently
it
was
deep
and
the
swirling
current
suggested
power
here
and
there
long
creeping
ferns
covered
the
steep
stone
sides
and
above
ran
a
stream
of
blue
sky
fringed
by
leaning
palms
once
hal
put
his
hands
to
his
lips
and
yelled
the
yell
seemed
to
rip
the
silence
and
began
to
clap
from
wall
to
wall
it
gathered
quickness
until
it
clapped
in
one
fiendish
rattle
then
it
wound
away
from
the
passage
growing
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
died
in
a
hollow
echo
don
t
do
that
again
ordered
ken
he
began
to
wish
he
could
see
the
end
of
that
gorge
but
it
grew
narrower
and
the
shade
changed
to
twilight
and
there
were
no
long
straight
stretches
the
river
kept
turning
corners
quick
to
note
the
slightest
change
in
conditions
ken
felt
a
breeze
merely
a
zephyr
fan
his
hot
face
the
current
had
almost
imperceptibly
quickened
yet
it
was
still
silent
then
on
the
gentle
wind
came
a
low
murmur
ken
s
pulse
beat
fast
turning
his
ear
he
strained
his
hearing
the
low
murmur
ceased
perhaps
he
had
imagined
it
still
he
kept
listening
there
again
it
came
low
far
away
strange
it
might
have
been
the
wind
in
the
palms
but
no
he
could
not
possibly
persuade
himself
it
was
wind
and
as
that
faint
breeze
stopped
he
lost
the
sound
once
more
the
river
was
silent
and
the
boat
and
the
boys
it
was
a
silent
ride
ken
divined
that
his
companions
were
enraptured
but
this
ride
had
no
beauty
no
charm
for
him
there
another
faint
puff
of
wind
and
again
the
low
murmur
he
fancied
it
was
louder
he
was
beginning
to
feel
an
icy
dread
when
all
was
still
once
more
so
the
boat
drifted
swiftly
on
with
never
a
gurgle
of
water
about
her
gunwales
the
river
gleamed
in
brown
shadows
ken
saw
bubbles
rise
and
break
on
the
surface
and
there
was
a
slight
rise
or
swell
of
the
water
toward
the
center
of
the
channel
this
bothered
him
he
could
not
understand
it
but
then
there
had
been
many
other
queer
formations
of
rock
and
freaks
of
current
along
this
river
the
boat
glided
on
and
turned
another
corner
the
sharpest
one
yet
a
long
shadowy
walled
in
to
the
very
sides
opened
up
to
ken
s
keen
gaze
the
water
here
began
to
race
onward
still
wonderfully
silent
and
now
the
breeze
carried
a
low
roar
it
was
changeable
yet
persistent
it
deepened
once
more
ken
felt
his
hair
rise
under
his
hat
cold
sweat
wet
his
skin
despite
the
pounding
of
his
heart
and
the
throb
of
his
veins
his
blood
seemed
to
clog
to
freeze
to
stand
still
that
roar
was
the
roar
of
rapids
impossible
to
go
back
if
there
had
been
four
sets
of
oars
ken
and
his
comrades
could
not
row
the
heavy
boat
back
up
that
swift
sliding
river
they
must
go
on
ken
old
man
do
you
hear
that
questioned
hal
waking
from
his
trance
george
likewise
rose
out
of
his
lazy
contentment
must
be
rapids
he
muttered
if
we
strike
rapids
in
this
gorge
it
s
all
day
with
us
what
did
i
tell
you
pepe
s
dark
searching
eyes
rested
on
ken
but
ken
had
no
word
for
any
of
them
he
was
fighting
an
icy
numbness
and
the
weakness
of
muscle
and
the
whirl
of
his
mind
it
was
thought
of
responsibility
that
saved
him
from
collapse
it
s
up
to
you
old
man
said
hal
quietly
in
a
moment
like
this
the
boy
could
not
wholly
be
deceived
ken
got
a
grip
upon
himself
he
looked
down
the
long
narrow
lane
of
glancing
water
some
hundred
yards
on
it
made
another
turn
round
a
corner
and
from
this
dim
curve
came
the
roar
the
current
was
hurrying
the
boat
toward
it
but
not
fast
enough
to
suit
ken
he
wanted
to
see
the
worst
to
get
into
the
thick
of
it
to
overcome
it
so
he
helped
the
boat
along
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
cover
that
gliding
stretch
of
river
yet
to
ken
it
seemed
never
to
have
an
end
the
roar
steadily
increased
the
current
became
still
stronger
ken
saw
eruptions
of
water
rising
as
from
an
explosion
beneath
the
surface
whirlpools
raced
along
with
the
boat
the
dim
high
walls
the
roaring
of
the
water
the
first
thing
ken
saw
when
he
sailed
round
that
corner
was
a
widening
of
the
chasm
and
bright
sunlight
ahead
perhaps
an
eighth
of
a
mile
below
the
steep
walls
ended
abruptly
next
in
quick
glance
he
saw
a
narrow
channel
of
leaping
tossing
curling
waves
under
sunlighted
mist
and
spray
pulling
powerfully
back
and
to
the
left
ken
brought
the
boat
alongside
the
cliff
then
he
shipped
his
oars
hold
hard
he
yelled
and
he
grasped
the
stone
the
boys
complied
and
thus
stopped
the
boat
ken
stood
up
on
the
seat
it
was
a
bad
place
he
looked
down
into
but
he
could
not
see
any
rocks
and
rocks
were
what
he
feared
most
hold
tight
boys
he
said
then
he
got
pepe
to
come
to
him
and
sit
on
the
seat
ken
stepped
up
on
pepe
s
shoulders
and
by
holding
to
the
rock
was
able
to
get
a
good
view
of
the
rapid
it
was
not
a
rapid
at
all
but
a
constriction
of
the
channel
and
also
a
steep
slant
the
water
rushed
down
so
swiftly
to
get
through
that
it
swelled
in
the
center
in
a
long
frothy
ridge
of
waves
the
water
was
deep
ken
could
not
see
any
bumps
or
splits
or
rocks
such
as
were
conspicuous
in
a
rapid
the
peril
here
for
ken
was
to
let
the
boat
hit
the
wall
or
turn
broadside
or
get
out
of
that
long
swelling
ridge
he
stepped
down
and
turned
to
the
boys
he
had
to
yell
close
to
them
to
make
them
hear
him
in
the
roar
i
can
run
this
place
but
you
ve
got
to
help
pull
the
canvas
up
higher
in
the
stern
and
hold
it
then
he
directed
pepe
to
kneel
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
with
an
oar
and
be
ready
to
push
off
from
the
walls
if
ken
had
looked
again
or
hesitated
a
moment
he
would
have
lost
his
nerve
he
recognized
that
fact
and
he
shoved
off
instantly
once
the
boat
had
begun
to
glide
down
gathering
momentum
he
felt
his
teeth
grind
hard
and
his
muscles
grow
tense
he
had
to
bend
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
see
beyond
the
canvas
george
and
hal
were
holding
round
their
shoulders
he
believed
with
that
acting
as
a
buffer
in
the
stern
he
could
go
pounding
through
those
waves
then
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
channel
and
the
boat
fairly
sailed
along
ken
kept
his
oars
poised
ready
to
drop
either
one
for
a
stroke
all
he
wanted
was
to
enter
those
foaming
tumultuous
waves
with
his
boat
pointed
right
he
knew
he
could
not
hope
to
see
anything
low
down
after
he
entered
the
race
he
calculated
that
the
last
instant
would
give
him
an
opportunity
to
get
his
direction
in
line
with
some
object
then
even
as
he
planned
it
the
boat
dipped
on
a
beautiful
glassy
incline
and
glided
down
toward
the
engulfing
roaring
waves
above
them
just
in
the
center
ken
caught
sight
of
the
tufted
top
of
a
that
was
his
landmark
the
boat
shot
into
a
great
curling
wave
there
was
a
heavy
shock
a
pause
and
then
ken
felt
himself
lifted
high
while
a
huge
sheet
of
water
rose
behind
the
buffer
in
the
stern
walls
and
sky
and
tree
faded
under
a
watery
curtain
then
the
boat
shot
on
again
the
light
came
the
sky
shone
and
ken
saw
his
he
pulled
hard
on
the
right
oar
to
get
the
stern
back
in
line
another
heavy
shock
a
pause
a
blinding
shower
of
water
and
then
the
downward
rush
ken
got
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
his
guiding
mark
and
sunk
the
left
oar
deep
for
a
strong
stroke
the
beating
of
the
waves
upon
the
upraised
oars
almost
threw
him
out
of
the
boat
the
wrestling
waters
hissed
and
bellowed
down
the
boat
shot
and
up
to
pound
and
pound
and
then
again
shoot
down
through
the
pall
of
mist
and
spray
ken
always
got
a
glimpse
quick
as
lightning
of
the
and
like
a
demon
he
plunged
in
his
oars
to
keep
the
boat
in
line
he
was
only
dimly
conscious
of
the
awfulness
of
the
place
but
he
was
not
afraid
he
felt
his
action
as
being
inspirited
by
something
grim
and
determined
he
was
fighting
the
river
all
at
once
a
grating
jar
behind
told
him
the
bow
had
hit
a
stone
or
a
wall
he
did
not
dare
look
back
the
most
fleeting
instant
of
time
might
be
the
one
for
him
to
see
his
guiding
mark
then
the
boat
lurched
under
him
lifted
high
with
bow
up
and
lightened
he
knew
pepe
had
been
pitched
overboard
in
spite
of
the
horror
of
the
moment
ken
realized
that
the
lightening
of
the
boat
made
it
more
buoyant
easier
to
handle
that
weight
in
the
bow
had
given
him
an
unbalanced
craft
but
now
one
stroke
here
and
one
there
kept
the
stern
straight
the
loomed
higher
and
closer
through
the
brightening
mist
ken
no
longer
felt
the
presence
of
the
walls
the
thunderous
roar
had
begun
to
lose
some
of
its
volume
then
with
a
crash
through
a
lashing
wave
the
boat
raced
out
into
the
open
light
ken
saw
a
beautiful
pool
down
toward
which
the
boat
kept
bumping
over
a
succession
of
diminishing
waves
he
gave
a
start
of
joy
to
see
pepe
s
black
head
bobbing
in
the
choppy
channel
pepe
had
beat
the
boat
to
the
outlet
he
was
swimming
easily
and
evidently
he
had
not
been
injured
ken
turned
the
bow
toward
him
but
pepe
did
not
need
any
help
and
a
few
more
strokes
put
him
in
shallow
water
ken
discovered
that
the
boat
once
out
of
the
current
was
exceedingly
loggy
and
hard
to
row
it
was
half
full
of
water
ken
s
remaining
strength
went
to
pull
ashore
and
there
he
staggered
out
and
dropped
on
the
rocky
bank
the
blue
sky
was
very
beautiful
and
sweet
to
look
at
just
then
but
ken
had
to
close
his
eyes
he
did
not
have
strength
left
to
keep
them
open
for
a
while
all
seemed
dim
and
obscure
to
him
then
he
felt
a
dizziness
which
in
turn
succeeded
to
a
racing
riot
of
his
nerves
and
veins
his
heart
gradually
resumed
a
normal
beat
and
his
bursting
lungs
seemed
to
heal
a
sickening
languor
lay
upon
him
he
could
not
hold
little
stones
which
he
felt
under
his
fingers
he
could
not
raise
his
hands
the
life
appeared
to
have
gone
from
his
legs
all
this
passed
at
length
and
hearing
hal
s
voice
ken
sat
up
the
outfit
was
drying
in
the
sun
pepe
was
bailing
out
the
boat
george
was
wiping
his
guns
and
hal
was
nursing
a
very
disheveled
little
racoon
you
can
bring
on
any
old
thing
now
for
all
i
care
said
hal
i
d
shoot
lachine
rapids
with
ken
at
the
oars
he
s
a
fine
boatman
replied
george
weren
t
you
scared
when
we
were
in
the
middle
of
that
darned
place
me
naw
well
i
was
scared
and
don
t
you
forget
it
said
ken
to
them
you
were
all
in
ken
replied
hal
never
saw
you
so
tuckered
out
the
day
you
and
prince
went
after
the
cougar
along
that
cañon
precipice
you
were
all
in
that
time
george
it
took
ken
six
hours
to
climb
out
of
that
hole
tell
me
about
it
said
george
all
eyes
no
stories
now
put
in
ken
the
sun
is
still
high
we
ve
got
to
be
on
our
way
let
s
look
over
the
lay
of
the
land
below
the
pool
was
a
bold
rocky
bluff
round
which
the
river
split
what
branch
to
take
was
a
matter
of
doubt
and
anxiety
to
ken
evidently
this
bluff
was
an
island
it
had
a
yellow
front
and
long
bare
ledges
leading
into
the
river
ken
climbed
the
bluff
accompanied
by
the
boys
and
found
it
covered
with
up
there
everything
was
so
dry
and
hot
that
it
did
not
seem
to
be
jungle
at
all
even
the
palms
were
yellow
and
parched
pepe
stood
the
heat
but
the
others
could
not
endure
it
ken
took
one
long
look
at
the
surrounding
country
so
wild
and
dry
and
still
and
then
led
the
way
down
the
loose
dusty
shelves
thereupon
he
surveyed
the
right
branch
of
the
river
and
followed
it
a
little
distance
the
stream
here
foamed
and
swirled
among
jagged
rocks
at
the
foot
of
this
rapid
stretched
the
first
dead
water
ken
had
encountered
for
miles
a
flock
of
wild
geese
rose
from
under
his
feet
and
flew
geese
exclaimed
ken
i
wonder
if
that
means
we
are
getting
down
near
lagoons
or
big
waters
george
wild
geese
don
t
frequent
little
streams
do
they
there
s
no
telling
where
you
ll
find
them
in
this
country
answered
george
i
ve
chased
them
right
in
our
orange
groves
they
returned
to
look
at
the
left
branch
of
the
river
it
was
open
and
one
continuous
succession
of
low
steps
that
would
have
decided
ken
even
if
the
greater
volume
of
water
had
not
gone
down
on
this
left
side
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
a
wide
open
river
running
over
little
ledges
it
looked
to
be
the
easiest
and
swiftest
navigation
he
had
come
upon
and
so
indeed
it
proved
the
water
was
swift
and
always
dropped
over
some
ledge
in
a
rounded
fall
that
was
safe
for
him
to
shoot
it
was
great
fun
going
over
these
places
the
boys
hung
their
feet
over
the
gunwales
most
of
the
time
sliding
them
along
the
slippery
ledge
or
giving
a
kick
to
help
the
momentum
when
they
came
to
a
fall
ken
would
drop
off
the
bow
hold
the
boat
back
and
swing
it
straight
then
jump
in
and
over
it
would
go
souse
there
were
so
many
of
these
ledges
and
they
were
so
close
together
that
going
over
them
grew
to
be
a
habit
it
induced
carelessness
the
boat
drifted
to
a
brow
of
a
fall
full
four
feet
high
ken
who
was
at
the
bow
leaped
off
just
in
time
to
save
the
boat
he
held
on
while
the
swift
water
surged
about
his
knees
he
yelled
for
the
boys
to
jump
as
the
stern
where
they
sat
was
already
over
the
fall
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
make
the
boys
vacate
quickly
enough
tumble
out
quick
bawled
ken
do
you
think
i
m
samson
over
they
went
up
to
their
necks
in
the
boiling
foam
and
not
a
second
too
soon
for
ken
could
hold
the
boat
no
longer
it
went
over
smoothly
just
dipping
the
stern
under
water
if
the
boys
had
remained
aboard
the
boat
would
have
swamped
as
it
was
pepe
managed
to
catch
the
rope
which
ken
had
wisely
thrown
out
and
he
drifted
down
to
the
next
ledge
ken
found
this
nearly
as
high
as
the
last
one
so
he
sent
the
boys
below
to
catch
the
boat
this
worked
all
right
the
shelves
slanted
slightly
with
the
shallow
part
of
the
water
just
at
the
break
of
the
ledge
they
passed
half
a
dozen
of
these
making
good
time
and
before
they
knew
it
were
again
in
a
deep
smooth
jungle
lane
with
bamboo
and
streamers
of
moss
waving
over
them
the
shade
was
cool
and
ken
settled
down
in
the
grateful
for
a
rest
to
his
surprise
he
did
not
see
a
bird
the
jungle
was
asleep
once
or
twice
ken
fancied
he
heard
the
tinkle
and
gurgle
of
water
running
over
rocks
the
boat
glided
along
silently
with
pepe
rowing
leisurely
george
asleep
hal
dreaming
ken
watched
the
beautiful
green
banks
they
were
high
a
mass
of
vines
flowering
and
fragrant
above
which
towered
the
jungle
giants
ken
wanted
to
get
out
and
study
those
forest
trees
but
he
made
no
effort
to
act
upon
his
good
intentions
and
felt
that
he
must
take
the
most
of
his
forestry
study
at
long
range
he
was
reveling
in
the
cool
recesses
under
the
leaning
cypresses
in
the
soft
swish
of
bearded
moss
and
the
strange
rustle
of
palms
in
the
dreamy
hum
of
the
resting
jungle
when
his
pleasure
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
santa
maria
yelled
pepe
george
woke
up
with
a
start
hal
had
been
jarred
out
of
his
and
looked
resentful
ken
gazed
about
him
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
going
into
a
trance
instead
of
coming
out
of
one
the
boat
was
fast
on
a
that
branch
of
the
river
ended
right
there
the
boys
had
come
all
those
miles
to
run
into
a
blind
pocket
ken
s
glance
at
the
high
yellow
bank
here
crumbling
and
bare
told
him
there
was
no
outlet
he
had
a
sensation
of
blank
dismay
gee
exclaimed
hal
softly
george
rubbed
his
eyes
and
searching
for
a
cigarette
he
muttered
we
re
lost
i
said
it
was
coming
to
us
we
ve
got
to
go
back
army
of
for
a
moment
ken
ward
was
utterly
crushed
under
the
weight
of
this
sudden
blow
it
was
so
sudden
that
he
had
no
time
to
think
or
his
mind
was
clamped
on
the
idea
of
attempting
to
haul
the
boat
up
that
long
insurmountable
series
of
falls
it
ll
be
an
awful
job
burst
out
hal
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
each
boy
was
the
same
idea
the
long
haul
wading
over
slippery
rocks
the
weariness
of
pushing
legs
against
the
swift
current
the
packing
of
supplies
uphill
and
then
the
toil
of
lifting
the
heavy
boat
up
over
a
fall
mucho
malo
said
pepe
and
he
groaned
that
was
significant
coming
from
a
who
thought
nothing
of
rowing
forty
miles
in
a
day
oh
but
it
s
tough
luck
cried
ken
why
didn
t
i
choose
the
right
branch
of
this
pesky
river
i
think
you
used
your
head
at
that
said
hal
most
of
the
water
came
down
on
this
side
where
did
it
go
hal
had
hit
the
vital
question
and
it
cleared
ken
s
brain
hal
you
re
talking
sense
where
did
that
water
go
it
couldn
t
all
have
sunk
into
the
earth
we
ll
find
out
we
won
t
try
to
go
back
we
go
back
pepe
shoved
off
the
oozy
mud
and
reluctantly
as
if
he
appreciated
the
dilemma
he
turned
the
boat
and
rowed
along
the
shore
as
soon
as
ken
had
recovered
somewhat
he
decided
there
must
be
an
outlet
which
he
had
missed
this
reminded
him
that
at
a
point
not
far
back
he
had
heard
the
tinkle
and
gurgle
of
unseen
water
flowing
over
rocks
he
directed
pepe
to
row
slowly
along
the
bank
that
he
thought
was
the
island
side
as
they
glided
under
the
drooping
bamboos
and
silky
curtains
of
moss
george
began
to
call
out
low
bridge
low
bridge
for
a
boy
who
was
forever
voicing
suggestions
as
to
what
might
soon
happen
he
was
extraordinarily
cheerful
there
were
places
where
all
had
to
lie
flat
and
others
where
pepe
had
to
use
his
this
disturbed
the
of
many
aquatic
birds
most
of
which
flew
swiftly
away
but
there
were
many
of
the
bitterns
that
did
not
take
to
flight
these
croaked
dismally
and
looked
down
upon
the
boys
with
strange
protruding
eyes
those
darn
birds
ll
give
me
the
willies
declared
hal
george
you
just
look
like
them
when
you
croak
about
what
s
coming
to
us
just
wait
retorted
george
it
ll
come
all
right
then
i
ll
have
the
fun
of
seeing
you
scared
silly
what
you
ll
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
cried
hal
hotly
i
ve
been
in
places
where
such
such
a
skinny
little
as
you
here
you
kids
stop
wrangling
ordered
ken
who
sensed
hostilities
in
the
air
we
ve
got
trouble
enough
suddenly
ken
signaled
pepe
to
stop
rowing
boys
i
hear
running
water
aha
here
s
a
current
see
it
s
making
right
under
this
bank
before
them
was
a
high
wall
of
vines
so
thick
that
nothing
could
be
seen
through
them
apparently
this
luxuriant
canopy
concealed
the
bank
pepe
poked
an
oar
into
it
but
found
nothing
solid
pepe
cut
a
way
through
we
ve
got
to
see
where
this
water
runs
it
was
then
that
ken
came
to
a
full
appreciation
of
a
he
had
often
fancied
it
a
much
less
serviceable
tool
than
an
ax
pepe
flashed
the
long
bright
blade
up
down
and
around
and
presently
the
boat
was
its
own
length
in
a
green
tunnel
pepe
kept
on
slashing
while
ken
poled
the
boat
in
and
the
other
boys
dumped
the
cut
foliage
overboard
soon
they
got
through
this
mass
of
hanging
vine
and
creeper
much
to
ken
s
surprise
and
delight
he
found
no
high
bank
but
low
flat
ground
densely
wooded
through
which
ran
a
narrow
deep
outlet
of
the
river
by
all
that
s
lucky
ejaculated
ken
george
and
hal
whooped
their
pleasure
and
pepe
rubbed
his
muscular
hands
then
all
fell
silent
the
deep
penetrating
silence
of
that
jungle
was
not
provocative
of
speech
the
shade
was
so
black
that
when
a
ray
of
sunlight
did
manage
to
pierce
the
dense
canopy
overhead
it
resembled
a
brilliant
golden
spear
a
few
lofty
palms
and
a
few
clumps
of
bamboo
rather
emphasized
the
lack
of
these
particular
species
in
this
forest
nor
was
there
any
of
the
familiar
streaming
moss
hanging
from
the
trees
this
glen
was
green
cool
dark
it
did
not
smell
exactly
swampy
but
rank
like
a
place
where
many
water
plants
were
growing
illustration
ken
shot
twice
at
the
head
of
the
snake
the
outlet
was
so
narrow
that
ken
was
not
able
to
use
the
oars
still
as
the
current
was
swift
the
boat
went
along
rapidly
he
saw
a
light
ahead
and
heard
the
babble
of
water
the
current
quickened
and
the
boat
drifted
suddenly
upon
the
edge
of
an
oval
glade
where
the
hot
sun
beat
down
a
series
of
abrupt
mossy
benches
over
which
the
stream
slid
almost
noiselessly
blocked
further
progress
the
first
thing
about
this
glade
that
ken
noted
particularly
after
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
steep
steps
was
the
multitude
of
snakes
sunning
themselves
along
the
line
of
further
progress
boys
it
ll
be
great
wading
down
there
hey
he
queried
pepe
grumbled
for
the
first
time
on
the
trip
ken
gathered
from
the
native
s
looks
and
speech
that
he
did
not
like
snakes
watch
me
peg
em
yelled
hal
and
he
began
to
throw
stones
with
remarkable
accuracy
hike
you
brown
george
not
to
be
outdone
made
a
dive
for
his
and
began
to
pop
as
if
he
had
no
love
for
snakes
ken
had
doubts
about
this
species
the
snakes
were
short
thick
dull
brown
in
color
and
the
way
they
slipped
into
the
stream
proved
they
were
ken
had
never
read
of
a
brown
so
he
doubted
that
these
belonged
to
that
poisonous
family
anyway
snakes
were
the
least
of
his
troubles
boys
you
re
doing
fine
he
said
there
are
about
a
thousand
snakes
there
and
you
ve
hit
about
six
he
walked
down
through
the
glade
into
the
forest
and
was
overjoyed
to
hear
once
more
the
heavy
roar
of
rapids
he
went
on
the
timber
grew
thinner
and
light
penetrated
the
jungle
presently
he
saw
the
gleam
of
water
through
the
trees
then
he
hurried
back
all
right
boys
he
shouted
here
s
the
river
the
boys
were
so
immensely
relieved
that
packing
the
outfit
round
the
waterfalls
was
work
they
set
about
with
alacrity
ken
who
had
on
his
boots
broke
a
trail
through
the
ferns
and
deep
moss
pepe
being
barefoot
wasted
time
looking
for
snakes
george
teased
him
but
pepe
was
deadly
serious
and
the
way
he
stepped
and
looked
made
ken
thoughtful
he
had
made
his
last
trip
with
supplies
and
was
about
to
start
back
to
solve
the
problem
of
getting
the
boat
down
when
a
hoarse
yell
resounded
through
the
sleeping
jungle
parrots
screeched
and
other
birds
set
up
a
cackling
ken
bounded
up
the
slope
santa
maria
cried
pepe
ken
followed
the
direction
indicated
by
pepe
s
staring
eyes
and
trembling
finger
hanging
from
a
limb
of
a
tree
was
a
huge
it
was
as
thick
as
ken
s
leg
the
branch
upon
which
it
poised
its
neck
so
gracefully
was
ten
feet
high
and
the
tail
curled
into
the
ferns
on
the
ground
boys
it
s
one
of
the
big
fellows
cried
ken
didn
t
i
tell
you
yelled
george
running
down
for
his
gun
hal
seemed
rooted
to
the
spot
pepe
began
to
jabber
ken
watched
the
snake
and
felt
instinctively
from
its
sinister
looks
that
it
was
dangerous
george
came
running
back
with
his
and
waved
it
in
the
air
as
he
shot
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
forgot
to
aim
ken
took
the
rifle
from
him
you
can
t
hit
him
with
this
run
after
your
shotgun
quick
but
the
was
clogged
with
a
shell
that
would
not
eject
ken
s
guns
were
in
their
cases
holy
smoke
cried
george
he
s
coming
down
the
moved
his
body
and
began
to
slide
toward
the
ken
shot
twice
at
the
head
of
the
snake
it
was
a
mark
hard
to
hit
the
reptile
stopped
and
poised
wonderfully
on
the
limb
he
was
not
coiled
about
it
but
lay
over
it
with
about
four
feet
of
neck
waving
swaying
to
and
fro
he
watched
the
boys
and
his
tongue
like
a
thin
black
streak
darted
out
viciously
ken
could
not
hit
the
head
so
he
sent
a
bullet
through
the
thick
part
of
the
body
swift
as
a
gleam
the
snake
darted
from
the
limb
santa
maria
yelled
pepe
and
he
ran
off
look
out
boys
shouted
ken
he
picked
up
pepe
s
and
took
to
his
heels
george
and
hal
scrambled
before
him
they
ran
a
hundred
yards
or
more
and
ken
halted
in
an
open
rocky
spot
he
was
angry
and
a
little
ashamed
that
he
had
run
the
snake
did
not
pursue
and
probably
was
as
badly
frightened
as
the
boys
had
been
pepe
stopped
some
distance
away
and
hal
and
george
came
cautiously
back
i
don
t
see
anything
of
him
said
ken
i
m
going
back
he
walked
slowly
keeping
a
sharp
outlook
and
returning
to
the
glade
found
under
the
tree
the
snake
had
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trail
if
i
d
had
my
shotgun
ready
exclaimed
ken
in
disgust
and
he
made
a
note
that
in
the
future
he
would
be
prepared
to
shoot
wasn
t
he
a
whopper
ken
said
hal
we
ought
to
have
got
his
hide
what
a
fine
specimen
boys
you
drive
away
those
few
little
snakes
while
i
figure
on
a
way
to
get
the
boat
down
not
on
your
life
replied
hal
george
ably
sustained
hal
s
objection
mucho
malo
said
pepe
and
then
added
a
loud
no
in
english
all
right
my
brave
comrades
rejoined
ken
scornfully
as
i
ve
not
done
any
work
yet
or
taken
any
risks
i
ll
drive
the
snakes
away
with
pepe
s
he
cut
a
long
forked
pole
trimmed
it
and
armed
with
this
weapon
he
assaulted
the
rolls
and
bands
and
balls
of
brown
snakes
he
stalked
boldly
down
upon
them
pushed
and
poled
and
even
kicked
them
off
the
mossy
banks
hal
could
not
stand
that
and
presently
he
got
a
pole
and
went
to
ken
s
assistance
who
s
hollering
now
he
yelled
to
george
whereupon
george
cut
a
long
branch
and
joined
the
battle
they
whacked
and
threshed
and
pounded
keeping
time
with
yells
everywhere
along
the
wet
benches
slipped
and
splashed
the
snakes
but
after
they
were
driven
into
the
water
they
did
not
swim
away
they
dove
under
the
banks
and
then
stretched
out
their
pointed
heads
from
the
dripping
edge
of
moss
say
fellows
we
re
making
it
worse
for
us
declared
ken
see
the
brown
devils
won
t
swim
off
we
d
better
have
left
them
on
the
bank
let
s
catch
one
and
see
if
he
ll
bite
he
tried
to
pick
up
one
on
his
pole
but
it
slipped
off
george
fished
after
another
hal
put
the
end
of
his
stick
down
inside
the
coil
of
still
another
and
pitched
it
the
brown
wriggling
wet
snake
shot
straight
at
the
unsuspecting
george
and
struck
him
and
momentarily
wound
about
him
augrrh
bawled
george
flinging
off
the
reptile
and
leaping
back
what
d
you
do
that
for
i
ll
punch
you
george
he
didn
t
mean
it
said
ken
it
was
an
accident
come
on
let
s
tease
that
fellow
and
see
if
he
ll
bite
the
snake
coiled
and
raised
his
flat
head
and
darted
a
wicked
tongue
out
and
watched
with
bright
beady
eyes
but
he
did
not
strike
ken
went
as
close
as
he
thought
safe
and
studied
the
snake
boys
his
head
isn
t
a
triangle
and
there
are
no
little
pits
under
his
eyes
those
are
two
signs
of
a
poisonous
snake
i
don
t
believe
this
fellow
s
one
he
ll
be
a
dead
snake
b
gosh
replied
george
and
he
fell
to
pounding
it
with
his
pole
don
t
smash
him
i
want
the
skin
yelled
hal
ken
pondered
on
the
situation
before
him
come
the
sooner
we
get
at
this
the
better
he
said
there
was
a
succession
of
benches
through
which
the
stream
zigzagged
and
tumbled
these
benches
were
rock
ledges
over
which
moss
had
grown
fully
a
foot
thick
and
they
were
so
oozy
and
slippery
that
it
was
no
easy
task
to
walk
upon
them
then
they
were
steep
so
steep
that
it
was
remarkable
how
the
water
ran
over
them
so
smoothly
with
very
little
noise
or
break
it
was
altogether
a
new
kind
of
waterfall
to
ken
but
if
the
snakes
had
not
been
hidden
there
navigation
would
have
presented
an
easier
problem
come
on
boys
alongside
now
and
hold
back
he
ordered
gripping
the
bow
exactly
what
happened
the
next
few
seconds
was
not
clear
in
his
mind
there
was
a
rush
and
all
were
being
dragged
by
the
boat
the
glade
seemed
to
whizz
past
there
were
some
sodden
thumps
a
great
splashing
a
check
and
lo
they
were
over
several
benches
it
was
the
quickest
and
easiest
descent
he
had
ever
made
down
a
steep
waterfall
fine
ejaculated
george
wiping
the
ooze
from
his
face
yes
it
was
fine
ken
replied
but
unless
this
boat
has
wings
something
ll
happen
soon
below
was
a
long
swift
curve
of
water
very
narrow
and
steep
with
a
rock
dividing
the
lower
end
ken
imagined
if
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
first
descent
the
boat
would
be
smashed
on
that
rock
he
ordered
pepe
who
was
of
course
the
strongest
to
go
below
and
jump
to
the
rock
there
he
might
prevent
a
collision
pepe
obeyed
but
as
he
went
he
yelled
and
doubled
up
in
contortions
as
he
leaped
over
snakes
in
the
moss
then
gently
gingerly
the
boys
started
the
boat
off
the
bench
where
it
had
lodged
george
was
at
the
stern
ken
and
hal
at
the
bow
suddenly
hal
shrieked
and
jumped
straight
up
to
land
in
the
boat
snakes
he
howled
give
us
a
rest
cried
ken
in
disgust
the
boat
moved
as
if
instinct
with
life
it
dipped
then
it
dove
over
the
bench
hal
was
thrown
off
his
feet
fell
back
on
the
gunwale
and
thence
into
the
snaky
moss
george
went
sprawling
face
downward
into
the
slimy
ooze
and
ken
was
jerked
clear
off
the
bench
into
the
stream
he
got
his
footing
and
stood
firm
in
water
to
his
waist
and
he
had
the
coiled
round
his
hands
help
help
he
yelled
as
he
felt
the
dragging
weight
too
much
for
him
if
ken
retarded
the
progress
of
the
boat
at
all
it
was
not
much
george
saw
his
distress
and
the
danger
menacing
the
boat
and
he
leaped
valiantly
forward
as
he
dashed
down
a
slippery
slant
his
feet
flew
up
higher
than
where
his
head
had
been
he
actually
turned
over
in
the
air
and
fell
with
a
great
sop
hal
had
been
trying
to
reach
ken
but
here
he
stopped
and
roared
with
laughter
despite
ken
s
anger
and
fear
of
snakes
and
his
greater
fear
for
the
boat
he
likewise
had
to
let
out
a
peal
of
laughter
that
tumble
of
george
s
was
great
then
ken
s
footing
gave
way
and
he
went
down
his
mouth
filled
with
nasty
water
nearly
strangling
him
he
was
almost
blinded
too
his
arms
seemed
to
be
wrenched
out
of
their
sockets
and
he
felt
himself
bumping
over
rocks
as
soft
as
cushions
slimy
ropes
or
roots
of
vegetation
that
felt
like
snakes
brushed
his
face
and
made
him
cold
and
sick
it
was
impossible
to
hold
the
boat
any
longer
he
lodged
against
a
stone
and
the
swift
water
forced
him
upon
it
blinking
and
coughing
he
stuck
fast
ken
saw
the
boat
headed
like
a
dart
for
the
rock
where
pepe
stood
let
er
go
yelled
ken
don
t
try
to
stop
her
pepe
you
ll
be
smashed
pepe
acted
like
a
man
determined
to
make
up
for
past
cowardice
he
made
a
great
show
of
brave
intentions
he
was
not
afraid
of
a
boat
he
braced
himself
and
reached
out
with
his
brawny
arms
ken
feared
for
the
obstinate
native
s
life
for
the
boat
moved
with
remarkable
velocity
at
the
last
second
pepe
s
courage
vanished
he
turned
tail
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
he
slipped
the
boat
shot
toward
him
and
the
blunt
stern
struck
him
with
a
dull
thud
pepe
sailed
into
the
air
over
the
rock
and
went
down
cleaving
the
water
the
boat
slipped
over
the
stone
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
a
wave
and
gliding
into
still
water
below
lodged
on
the
bank
ken
crawled
out
of
the
stream
and
when
he
ascertained
that
no
one
was
injured
he
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
and
gave
up
to
mirth
pepe
resembled
a
drowned
rat
hal
was
an
object
to
wonder
at
and
george
in
his
coating
of
slime
and
with
strings
of
moss
in
his
hair
was
the
funniest
thing
ken
had
ever
seen
it
was
somewhat
of
a
surprise
to
him
to
discover
presently
that
the
boys
were
convulsed
with
fiendish
glee
over
the
way
he
himself
looked
by
and
by
they
recovered
and
with
many
a
merry
jest
and
chuckle
of
satisfaction
they
repacked
the
boat
and
proceeded
on
their
way
no
further
obstacle
hindered
them
they
drifted
out
of
the
shady
jungle
into
the
sunlit
river
in
half
a
mile
of
drifting
the
heat
of
the
sun
dried
the
boys
clothes
the
water
was
so
hot
that
it
fairly
steamed
once
more
the
boat
entered
a
placid
aisle
over
which
the
magnificent
cypresses
bowed
and
the
west
wind
waved
long
ribbons
of
moss
and
wild
fowl
winged
reluctant
flight
ken
took
advantage
of
this
tranquil
stretch
of
river
to
work
on
his
map
he
realized
that
he
must
use
every
spare
moment
and
put
down
his
drawings
and
notes
as
often
as
time
and
travel
permitted
it
had
dawned
on
ken
that
rapids
and
snakes
and
all
the
dangers
along
the
river
made
his
task
of
observation
and
study
one
apt
to
be
put
into
eclipse
at
times
once
or
twice
he
landed
on
shore
to
climb
a
bluff
and
was
pleased
each
time
to
see
that
he
had
lined
a
comparatively
true
course
on
his
map
he
had
doubts
of
its
absolute
accuracy
yet
he
could
not
help
having
pride
in
his
work
so
far
so
good
he
thought
and
hoped
for
farther
down
the
river
strange
beyond
a
bend
in
the
river
the
boys
came
upon
an
island
with
a
narrow
shaded
channel
on
one
side
a
wide
shoal
on
the
other
and
a
group
of
huge
cypresses
at
the
end
looks
good
to
me
said
hal
the
instant
ken
saw
the
island
he
knew
it
was
the
place
he
had
long
been
seeking
to
make
a
permanent
camp
for
a
few
days
they
landed
to
find
an
ideal
camping
site
the
ground
under
the
cypresses
was
flat
dry
and
covered
with
short
grass
not
a
ray
of
sunlight
penetrated
the
foliage
a
pile
of
driftwood
had
lodged
against
one
of
the
trees
and
this
made
easy
the
question
of
great
exclaimed
ken
come
on
let
s
look
over
the
ground
the
island
was
about
two
hundred
yards
long
and
the
lower
end
was
hidden
by
a
growth
of
willows
bursting
through
this
the
boys
saw
a
weedy
flat
leading
into
a
wide
shallow
great
numbers
of
ducks
were
sporting
and
feeding
the
stones
of
the
rocky
shore
were
lined
with
sleeping
ducks
herons
of
all
colors
and
sizes
waded
about
or
slept
on
one
leg
snipe
ran
everywhere
there
was
a
great
squawking
and
flapping
of
wings
but
at
least
half
the
number
of
waterfowl
were
too
tame
or
too
lazy
to
fly
ken
returned
to
camp
with
his
comrades
all
highly
elated
over
the
prospects
the
best
feature
about
this
beautiful
island
was
the
absence
of
ticks
and
snakes
boys
this
is
the
place
said
ken
we
ll
hang
up
here
for
a
while
maybe
we
won
t
strike
another
such
nice
place
to
stay
so
they
unloaded
the
boat
taking
everything
out
and
proceeded
to
pitch
a
camp
that
was
a
delight
they
were
all
loud
in
expressions
of
satisfaction
then
pepe
set
about
leisurely
peeling
potatoes
george
took
his
gun
and
slipped
off
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
island
hal
made
a
pen
for
his
racoon
and
then
more
pens
as
if
he
meant
to
capture
a
menagerie
and
ken
made
a
comfortable
under
a
cypress
he
wanted
to
forget
that
nagging
worry
as
to
farther
descent
of
the
river
and
to
enjoy
this
place
bang
went
george
s
a
loud
whirring
of
wings
followed
and
the
air
was
full
of
ducks
never
touched
one
yelled
hal
in
taunting
voice
a
flock
of
teal
skimmed
the
water
and
disappeared
the
shot
awakened
parrots
in
the
trees
where
for
a
while
there
was
clamor
ken
saw
george
wade
out
into
the
shoal
and
pick
up
three
ducks
exclaimed
hal
disgustedly
why
couldn
t
he
be
a
sport
and
shoot
them
on
the
fly
george
crossed
to
the
opposite
shore
and
climbing
a
bare
place
stood
looking
before
him
hey
george
don
t
go
far
called
ken
fine
place
over
here
replied
george
and
waving
his
hand
he
passed
into
the
bushes
out
of
sight
ken
lay
back
upon
his
blanket
with
a
blissful
sense
of
rest
and
contentment
many
a
time
he
had
lain
so
looking
up
through
the
broad
leaves
of
a
sycamore
or
the
lacy
foliage
of
a
birch
or
the
delicate
crisscross
of
millions
of
pine
needles
this
overhead
canopy
however
was
different
only
here
and
there
could
he
catch
little
slivers
of
blue
sky
the
graceful
streamers
of
exquisite
moss
hung
like
tassels
of
silver
in
the
dead
stillness
of
noonday
they
seemed
to
float
curved
in
the
shape
in
which
the
last
soft
breeze
had
left
them
high
upon
a
branch
he
saw
a
parrot
hanging
back
downward
after
the
fashion
of
a
monkey
then
there
were
two
parrots
asleep
in
the
fork
of
a
branch
it
was
the
middle
of
the
day
and
all
things
seemed
tired
and
sleepy
the
deep
channel
murmured
drowsily
and
the
wide
expanse
of
river
on
the
other
side
lapped
lazily
at
the
shore
the
only
other
sound
was
the
mourning
of
one
near
and
another
far
away
again
the
full
richness
the
mellow
sweetness
of
this
song
struck
ken
forcibly
he
remembered
that
all
the
way
down
the
river
he
had
heard
that
mournful
note
it
was
beautiful
but
melancholy
somehow
it
made
him
think
that
it
had
broken
the
dreamy
stillness
of
the
jungle
noonday
long
long
ago
it
was
sweet
but
sad
and
old
he
did
not
like
to
hear
it
ken
yielded
to
the
soothing
influence
of
the
hour
and
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
there
was
george
standing
partially
undressed
and
very
soberly
popping
ticks
he
had
enlisted
the
services
of
pepe
and
to
judge
from
the
remarks
of
both
they
needed
still
more
assistance
say
garrapato
george
many
ticks
over
there
ticks
shouted
george
wildly
waving
his
cigarette
millions
of
em
and
there
s
ouch
kill
that
one
pepe
wow
he
s
as
big
as
a
penny
there
s
game
over
there
it
s
a
flat
with
some
kind
of
berry
bush
there
s
lots
of
trails
i
saw
and
i
scared
up
wild
turkeys
turkeys
ken
exclaimed
eagerly
you
bet
i
saw
a
dozen
how
they
can
run
i
didn
t
flush
them
then
i
saw
a
flock
of
those
black
and
white
ducks
like
the
big
fellow
i
shot
they
were
feeding
i
believe
they
re
muscovy
ducks
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
but
we
can
call
them
that
well
i
d
got
a
shot
too
but
i
saw
some
gray
things
sneaking
in
the
bushes
i
thought
they
were
pigs
so
i
got
out
of
there
quick
you
mean
javelin
yep
i
mean
wild
pigs
oh
we
ve
struck
the
place
for
game
i
ll
bet
it
s
coming
to
us
when
george
anticipated
pleasurable
events
he
was
the
most
happy
of
companions
it
was
good
to
look
forward
he
was
continually
expecting
things
to
happen
he
was
always
looking
ahead
with
great
eagerness
but
unfortunately
he
had
a
twist
of
mind
toward
the
unfavorable
side
of
events
and
so
always
had
the
boys
fearful
well
pigs
or
no
pigs
ticks
or
no
ticks
we
ll
hunt
and
fish
and
see
all
there
is
to
see
declared
ken
and
he
went
back
to
his
lounging
when
he
came
out
of
that
lazy
spell
george
and
hal
were
fishing
george
had
ken
s
rod
and
it
happened
to
be
the
one
ken
thought
most
of
do
you
know
how
to
fish
he
asked
i
ve
caught
tarpon
bigger
n
you
retorted
george
that
fact
was
indeed
too
much
for
ken
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
risk
his
beloved
rod
in
george
s
hands
and
the
way
george
swung
it
about
slashed
branches
with
it
dropped
the
tip
in
the
water
was
exceedingly
alarming
to
ken
the
boy
would
break
the
tip
in
a
minute
yet
ken
could
not
take
his
rod
away
from
a
boy
who
had
caught
tarpon
there
were
fish
breaking
water
where
a
little
while
before
the
river
had
been
smooth
now
it
was
ruffled
by
gar
and
other
fish
pepe
could
not
name
but
george
and
hal
did
not
get
a
bite
they
tried
all
their
artificial
flies
and
spoons
and
minnows
then
the
preserved
mullet
and
finally
several
kinds
of
meat
bah
they
want
pie
said
hal
for
ken
ward
to
see
little
and
big
fish
capering
around
under
his
very
nose
and
not
be
able
to
hook
one
was
exasperating
he
shot
a
small
fish
not
unlike
a
pickerel
and
had
the
boys
bait
with
that
still
no
strike
was
forthcoming
this
put
ken
on
his
mettle
he
rigged
up
a
minnow
tackle
and
going
to
the
lower
end
of
the
island
he
tried
to
catch
some
minnows
there
were
plenty
of
them
in
the
shallow
water
but
they
would
not
bite
finally
ken
waded
in
the
shoal
and
turned
over
stones
he
found
some
snails
almost
as
large
as
mussels
and
with
these
he
hurried
back
to
the
boys
here
if
you
don
t
get
a
bite
on
one
of
these
i
m
no
fisherman
said
ken
try
one
george
got
his
hands
on
the
new
bait
in
advance
of
hal
and
so
threw
his
hook
into
the
water
first
no
sooner
had
the
bait
sunk
than
he
got
a
strong
pull
there
careful
now
said
ken
george
jerked
up
hooking
a
fish
that
made
the
rod
look
like
a
give
me
the
rod
yelled
ken
trying
to
take
it
it
s
my
fish
yelled
back
george
he
held
on
and
hauled
with
all
his
might
a
long
finely
built
fish
green
as
emerald
split
the
water
and
churned
it
into
foam
then
sweeping
out
in
strong
dash
it
broke
ken
s
rod
square
in
the
middle
ken
eyed
the
wreck
with
sorrow
and
george
with
no
little
disapproval
you
said
you
knew
how
to
fish
protested
ken
those
rods
are
no
good
replied
george
they
won
t
hold
a
fish
george
you
re
a
grand
fisherman
observed
hal
with
a
chuckle
why
you
only
dreamed
you
ve
caught
tarpon
just
then
hal
had
a
tremendous
strike
he
was
nearly
hauled
off
the
bank
but
he
recovered
his
balance
and
clung
to
his
nodding
rod
hal
s
rod
was
heavy
cane
and
his
line
was
thick
enough
to
suit
so
nothing
broke
the
little
brass
reel
buzzed
and
rattled
i
ve
got
a
whale
yelled
hal
it
s
a
big
gar
said
george
you
haven
t
got
him
he
s
got
you
the
fish
broke
water
showing
long
open
jaws
with
teeth
like
it
threshed
about
and
broke
away
hal
reeled
in
to
find
the
hook
straightened
out
then
george
kindly
commented
upon
the
very
skilful
manner
in
which
hal
had
handled
the
gar
for
a
wonder
hal
did
not
reply
by
four
o
clock
when
ken
sat
down
to
supper
he
was
so
thirsty
that
his
mouth
puckered
as
dry
as
if
he
had
been
eating
green
persimmons
this
matter
of
thirst
had
become
serious
twice
each
day
ken
had
boiled
a
pot
of
water
into
which
he
mixed
cocoa
sugar
and
condensed
milk
and
begged
the
boys
to
drink
that
and
nothing
else
nevertheless
pepe
and
george
and
occasionally
hal
would
drink
unboiled
water
for
this
meal
the
boys
had
venison
and
duck
and
canned
vegetables
and
fruit
so
they
fared
sumptuously
pepe
pointed
to
a
string
of
muscovy
ducks
sailing
up
the
river
george
had
a
good
shot
at
the
tail
end
of
the
flock
and
did
not
even
loosen
a
feather
then
a
line
of
cranes
and
herons
passed
over
the
island
when
a
small
bunch
of
teal
flew
by
to
be
followed
by
several
canvasbacks
ken
ran
for
his
shotgun
it
was
a
fine
hammerless
a
gun
and
one
ken
used
for
in
his
hurry
he
grasped
a
handful
of
the
first
shells
he
came
to
and
when
he
ran
to
the
found
they
were
loads
of
small
shot
he
decided
to
try
them
anyhow
while
pepe
leisurely
finished
the
supper
ken
and
george
and
hal
sat
on
the
bank
watching
for
ducks
just
before
the
sun
went
down
a
hard
wind
blew
making
difficult
shooting
every
few
moments
ducks
would
whir
by
george
s
gun
missed
fire
often
and
when
it
did
work
all
right
he
missed
the
ducks
to
ken
s
surprise
he
found
the
load
of
small
shot
very
deadly
he
could
sometimes
reach
a
duck
at
eighty
yards
the
little
brown
ducks
and
teal
he
stopped
as
if
they
had
hit
a
stone
wall
he
dropped
a
canvasback
with
the
sheer
dead
plunge
that
he
liked
ken
thought
a
crippled
duck
enough
to
make
a
hunter
quit
shooting
with
six
ducks
killed
he
decided
to
lay
aside
his
gun
for
that
time
when
pepe
pointed
down
the
river
pato
real
he
said
ken
looked
eagerly
and
saw
three
of
the
big
black
ducks
flying
as
high
as
the
treetops
and
coming
fast
snapping
a
couple
of
shells
in
the
gun
ken
stood
ready
at
the
end
of
the
island
two
of
the
ducks
wheeled
to
the
left
but
the
big
leader
came
on
like
a
thunderbolt
to
ken
he
made
a
canvasback
seem
slow
ken
caught
him
over
the
sights
of
the
gun
followed
him
up
till
he
was
abreast
and
beyond
then
sweeping
a
little
ahead
of
him
ken
pulled
both
triggers
the
muscovy
swooped
up
and
almost
stopped
in
his
flight
while
a
cloud
of
black
feathers
puffed
away
on
the
wind
he
sagged
a
little
recovered
and
flew
on
as
strong
as
ever
the
small
shot
were
not
heavy
enough
to
stop
him
we
ll
need
big
loads
for
the
muscovies
and
the
turkeys
said
george
we
ve
all
sizes
up
to
bb
s
replied
ken
george
let
s
take
a
walk
over
there
where
you
saw
the
turkeys
it
s
early
yet
then
pepe
told
george
if
they
wanted
to
see
game
at
that
hour
the
thing
to
do
was
to
sit
still
in
camp
and
watch
the
game
come
down
to
the
river
to
drink
and
he
pointed
to
a
herd
of
small
deer
quietly
walking
out
on
the
bar
after
all
the
noise
we
made
exclaimed
ken
well
this
beats
me
george
we
ll
stay
right
here
and
not
shoot
again
i
ve
an
idea
we
ll
see
something
worth
while
it
was
pepe
s
idea
but
ken
instantly
saw
its
possibilities
there
were
no
tributaries
to
the
river
or
springs
in
that
dry
jungle
and
as
manifestly
the
whole
country
abounded
in
game
it
must
troop
down
to
the
river
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
to
allay
the
hot
day
s
thirst
the
boys
were
perfectly
situated
for
watching
the
dark
bank
on
the
channel
side
of
the
island
as
well
as
the
open
bars
on
the
other
the
huge
cypresses
cast
shadows
that
even
in
daylight
effectually
concealed
them
they
put
out
the
and
taking
comfortable
seats
in
the
folds
of
the
great
gnarled
roots
began
to
watch
and
listen
the
vanguard
of
thirsty
deer
had
prepared
ken
for
something
remarkable
and
he
was
in
no
wise
disappointed
the
trooping
of
deer
down
to
the
water
s
edge
and
the
flight
of
wild
fowl
increased
in
proportion
to
the
gathering
shadows
of
twilight
the
deer
must
have
got
a
scent
for
they
raised
their
long
ears
and
stood
still
as
statues
gazing
across
toward
the
upper
end
of
the
island
but
they
showed
no
fear
it
was
only
when
they
had
drunk
their
fill
and
wheeled
about
to
go
up
the
narrow
trails
over
the
bank
that
they
showed
uneasiness
and
haste
this
made
ken
wonder
if
they
were
fearful
of
being
ambushed
by
jaguars
soon
the
dark
line
of
deer
along
the
shore
shaded
into
the
darkness
of
night
then
ken
heard
soft
splashes
and
an
occasional
patter
of
hard
hoofs
the
whir
of
wings
had
ceased
a
low
exclamation
from
pepe
brought
attention
to
interesting
developments
closer
at
hand
javelin
he
whispered
on
the
channel
side
of
the
island
was
impenetrable
pitchy
blackness
ken
tried
to
pierce
it
with
straining
eyes
but
he
could
not
even
make
out
the
that
he
knew
was
only
ten
yards
distant
still
he
could
hear
and
that
was
thrilling
enough
everywhere
on
this
side
along
the
edge
of
the
water
and
up
the
steep
bank
were
faint
tickings
of
twigs
and
soft
rustlings
of
leaves
then
there
was
a
continuous
sound
so
low
as
to
be
almost
inaudible
that
resembled
nothing
ken
could
think
of
so
much
as
a
long
line
of
softly
dripping
water
it
swelled
in
volume
to
a
tiny
roll
and
ended
in
a
sharp
clicking
on
rocks
and
a
gentle
splashing
in
the
water
a
drove
of
had
come
down
to
drink
occasionally
the
glint
of
green
eyes
made
the
darkness
all
the
more
weird
suddenly
a
long
piercing
wail
a
keen
cry
almost
human
quivered
into
the
silence
panther
ken
whispered
instantly
to
the
boys
it
was
a
different
cry
from
that
of
the
lion
of
the
cañon
but
there
was
a
strange
wild
note
that
betrayed
the
species
a
stillness
fell
dead
as
that
of
a
subterranean
cavern
strain
his
ears
as
he
might
ken
could
not
detect
the
slightest
sound
it
was
as
if
no
or
any
other
animals
had
come
down
to
drink
that
listening
palpitating
moment
seemed
endless
what
mystery
of
wild
life
it
meant
that
silence
following
the
cry
of
the
panther
then
the
jungle
sounds
recommenced
the
swishing
of
water
the
brushing
in
the
thicket
stealthy
padded
footsteps
the
faint
snapping
of
twigs
some
kind
of
a
cat
uttered
an
unearthly
squall
close
upon
this
the
clattering
of
deer
up
the
bank
on
the
other
side
rang
out
sharply
the
deer
were
running
and
the
striking
of
the
little
hoofs
ceased
in
short
order
ken
listened
intently
from
far
over
the
bank
came
a
sound
not
unlike
a
cough
deep
hoarse
inexpressibly
wild
and
menacing
tigre
cried
pepe
gripping
ken
hard
with
both
hands
he
could
feel
him
trembling
it
showed
how
the
native
of
the
feared
the
jaguar
again
the
cough
rasped
out
nearer
and
louder
this
time
it
was
not
a
sound
and
seemed
on
second
thought
more
of
a
growl
than
a
cough
ken
felt
safe
on
the
island
nevertheless
he
took
up
his
rifle
that
s
a
tiger
whispered
george
i
heard
one
once
from
the
porch
of
the
alamitas
hacienda
a
third
time
the
jaguar
told
of
his
arrival
upon
the
night
scene
ken
was
excited
and
had
a
thrill
of
fear
he
made
up
his
mind
to
listen
with
clearer
ears
but
the
cough
or
growl
was
not
repeated
then
a
silence
set
in
so
unbroken
that
it
seemed
haunted
by
the
echoes
of
those
wild
jungle
cries
perhaps
ken
had
the
haunting
echoes
in
mind
he
knew
what
had
sent
the
deer
away
and
stilled
the
splashings
and
creepings
it
was
the
hoarse
voice
of
the
lord
of
the
jungle
pepe
and
the
boys
too
fell
under
the
spell
of
the
hour
they
did
not
break
the
charm
by
talking
giant
fireflies
accentuated
the
ebony
blackness
and
a
low
hum
of
insects
riveted
the
attention
on
the
stillness
ken
could
not
understand
why
he
was
more
thoughtful
on
this
trip
than
he
had
ever
been
before
somehow
he
felt
immeasurably
older
probably
that
was
because
it
had
seemed
necessary
for
him
to
act
like
a
man
even
if
he
was
only
a
boy
the
black
mantle
of
night
lifted
from
under
the
cypresses
leaving
a
gloom
that
slowly
paled
through
the
dark
foliage
low
down
over
the
bank
appeared
the
white
tropical
moon
shimmering
gleams
chased
the
shadows
across
the
ripples
and
slowly
the
river
brightened
to
a
silver
sheen
a
great
peace
fell
upon
the
jungle
world
how
white
how
wild
how
wonderful
it
only
made
the
island
more
beautiful
and
lonely
the
thought
of
leaving
it
gave
ken
ward
a
pang
almost
he
wished
he
were
a
savage
and
he
lay
there
thinking
of
the
wild
places
that
he
could
never
see
where
the
sun
shone
the
wind
blew
the
twilight
shadowed
the
rain
fell
where
the
colors
and
beauties
changed
with
the
passing
hours
where
a
myriad
of
wild
creatures
preyed
upon
each
other
and
night
never
darkened
but
upon
strife
and
death
upon
awakening
in
the
early
morning
ken
found
his
state
one
of
huge
enjoyment
he
was
still
lazily
tired
but
the
dead
drag
and
ache
had
gone
from
his
bones
a
cool
breeze
wafted
the
mist
from
the
river
breaking
it
up
into
clouds
between
which
streamed
rosy
shafts
of
sunlight
from
the
fire
pepe
was
starting
blew
fragrantly
over
him
a
hundred
thousand
birds
seemed
to
be
trying
to
burst
their
throats
the
air
was
full
of
music
he
lay
still
listening
to
this
melodious
herald
of
the
day
till
it
ceased
then
a
flock
of
parrots
approached
and
circled
over
the
island
screeching
like
a
band
of
flying
imps
presently
they
alighted
in
the
cypresses
bending
the
branches
to
a
and
giving
the
trees
a
spotted
appearance
of
green
and
red
pepe
waved
his
hand
toward
another
flock
sweeping
over
parrakeets
he
said
these
birds
were
a
solid
green
much
smaller
than
the
with
longer
tails
they
appeared
wilder
than
the
and
flew
higher
circling
the
same
way
and
screeching
but
they
did
not
alight
other
flocks
sailed
presently
from
all
directions
the
last
one
was
a
cloud
of
parrots
a
shining
green
and
yellow
mass
several
acres
in
extent
they
flew
still
higher
than
the
parrakeets
shouted
george
they
re
the
big
fellows
the
talkers
if
there
ain
t
a
million
of
em
the
boys
ate
breakfast
in
a
din
that
made
conversation
useless
the
swooped
down
upon
the
island
and
the
two
unfriendly
species
flew
back
and
forth
manifestly
trying
to
drive
the
boys
off
the
mist
had
blown
away
the
sun
was
shining
bright
when
the
myriad
of
parrots
in
large
and
small
flocks
departed
to
other
jungle
haunts
pepe
rowed
across
the
wide
shoal
to
the
there
in
the
soft
ooze
among
the
hundreds
of
ken
found
a
larger
than
his
spread
hand
it
was
different
from
a
yet
he
could
not
distinguish
just
what
the
difference
was
pepe
who
had
accompanied
the
boys
to
carry
the
rifles
and
game
pointed
to
the
track
and
said
vehemently
tigre
he
pronounced
it
and
he
added
grande
big
he
certainly
is
ken
replied
boys
we
ll
kill
this
jaguar
we
ll
bait
this
with
a
deer
carcass
and
watch
once
upon
the
bank
ken
was
surprised
to
see
a
wide
stretch
of
comparatively
flat
land
it
was
covered
with
a
low
vegetation
with
here
and
there
on
the
little
ridges
and
bamboo
clumps
down
in
the
swales
beyond
the
flat
rose
the
dark
line
of
dense
jungle
it
was
not
clear
to
ken
why
that
low
piece
of
ground
was
not
overgrown
with
the
matted
thickets
and
vines
and
big
trees
characteristic
of
other
parts
of
the
jungle
they
struck
into
one
of
the
trails
and
had
not
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
they
espied
a
herd
of
deer
the
grass
and
low
bushes
almost
covered
them
george
handed
his
shotgun
to
pepe
and
took
his
rifle
shoot
low
said
ken
george
pulled
the
trigger
and
with
the
report
a
deer
went
down
but
it
was
not
the
one
ken
was
looking
at
nor
the
one
at
which
he
believed
george
had
aimed
the
rest
of
the
herd
bounded
away
to
disappear
in
a
swale
wading
through
bushes
and
grass
they
found
george
s
quarry
a
small
deer
weighing
perhaps
sixty
pounds
pepe
carried
it
over
to
the
trail
ken
noted
that
he
was
exceedingly
happy
to
carry
the
rifles
they
went
on
at
random
somehow
feeling
that
no
matter
in
what
direction
they
would
run
into
something
to
shoot
at
the
first
bamboo
swale
was
alive
with
up
to
this
time
ken
had
not
seen
this
beautiful
pheasant
fly
in
the
open
and
he
was
astonished
at
its
speed
it
would
burst
out
of
the
thick
bamboo
whir
its
wings
swiftly
then
sail
that
sail
was
a
most
graceful
thing
to
see
george
pulled
his
twice
and
missed
both
times
he
had
the
beginner
s
fault
shooting
too
soon
presently
pepe
beat
a
big
cock
out
of
the
bush
he
made
such
a
fine
target
he
sailed
so
evenly
that
ken
simply
looked
at
him
over
the
and
followed
him
till
he
was
out
of
sight
the
next
one
he
dropped
like
a
plummet
shooting
was
too
easy
he
decided
they
presented
so
fair
a
mark
that
it
was
unfair
to
pull
on
them
george
was
an
impetuous
hunter
ken
could
not
keep
near
him
nor
coax
or
command
him
to
stay
near
he
would
wander
off
by
himself
that
was
one
mark
in
his
favor
at
least
he
had
no
fear
pepe
hung
close
to
ken
and
hal
with
his
dark
eyes
roving
everywhere
ken
climbed
out
on
one
side
of
the
swale
george
on
the
other
catching
his
whistle
ken
turned
to
look
after
him
he
waved
and
pointing
ahead
began
to
stoop
and
slip
along
from
bush
to
bush
presently
a
flock
of
muscovy
ducks
rose
before
him
sailed
a
few
rods
and
alighted
then
from
right
under
his
feet
labored
up
great
gray
birds
wild
geese
ken
recognized
them
as
george
s
gun
went
one
tumbled
over
the
others
wheeled
toward
the
river
ken
started
down
into
the
swale
to
cross
to
where
george
was
when
pepe
touched
his
arm
turkeys
he
whispered
that
changed
ken
s
mind
pepe
pointed
into
the
low
bushes
ahead
and
slowly
led
ken
forward
he
heard
a
peculiar
low
thumping
trails
led
everywhere
and
here
and
there
were
open
patches
covered
with
a
scant
growth
of
grass
across
one
of
these
flashed
a
bronze
streak
then
another
and
another
shoot
shoot
said
pepe
tensely
those
bronze
streaks
were
running
turkeys
the
thumpings
were
made
by
their
rapidly
moving
feet
don
t
they
flush
fly
ken
queried
of
pepe
no
no
shoot
exclaimed
he
as
another
streak
of
brown
crossed
an
open
spot
ken
hurriedly
unbreached
his
gun
and
changed
the
light
shells
for
others
loaded
with
heavy
shot
he
reached
the
edge
of
a
bare
spot
across
which
a
turkey
ran
with
incredible
swiftness
he
did
not
get
the
gun
in
line
with
it
at
all
then
two
more
broke
out
of
the
bushes
run
they
were
as
swift
as
flying
quail
ken
took
two
and
missed
both
times
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
he
would
miss
a
running
turkey
at
fifty
feet
he
would
have
been
insulted
but
he
did
not
loosen
a
feather
loading
again
he
yelled
for
george
hey
george
turkeys
he
whooped
and
started
across
on
the
run
gee
said
hal
ken
i
couldn
t
do
any
worse
shooting
than
you
let
me
take
a
few
pegs
ken
handed
over
the
heavy
gun
and
fell
back
a
little
giving
hal
the
lead
they
walked
on
peering
closely
into
the
bushes
suddenly
a
beautiful
big
gobbler
ran
out
of
a
thicket
and
then
stopped
to
stretch
out
his
long
neck
and
look
shoot
hurry
whispered
ken
what
a
chance
that
s
a
tame
turkey
said
hal
tame
why
you
tenderfoot
he
s
as
wild
as
wild
can
t
you
see
that
ken
s
excitement
and
pepe
s
intense
eagerness
all
at
once
seemed
communicated
to
hal
he
hauled
up
the
gun
fingered
the
triggers
awkwardly
then
shot
both
barrels
he
tore
a
tremendous
hole
in
the
brush
some
few
feet
to
one
side
of
the
turkey
then
the
great
bird
ran
swiftly
out
of
sight
didn
t
want
to
kill
him
sitting
anyhow
said
hal
handing
the
gun
back
to
ken
we
want
to
eat
some
wild
turkey
don
t
we
well
we
d
better
take
any
chance
these
birds
are
game
hal
and
don
t
you
forget
that
what
s
all
the
shooting
panted
george
as
he
joined
the
march
just
then
there
was
a
roar
in
the
bushes
and
a
brown
blur
rose
and
whizzed
ahead
like
a
huge
bullet
that
turkey
had
flushed
ken
watched
him
fly
till
he
went
down
out
of
sight
into
a
distant
swale
pretty
nifty
flier
eh
said
george
he
was
too
quick
for
me
great
replied
ken
there
was
another
roar
and
a
huge
bronze
sped
straight
ahead
ken
shot
both
barrels
then
george
shot
one
all
clean
misses
ken
watched
this
turkey
fly
and
saw
him
clearer
he
had
to
admit
that
the
wild
turkey
of
the
tamaulipas
jungle
had
a
swifter
and
more
beautiful
flight
than
his
favorite
bird
the
ruffled
grouse
walk
faster
said
george
they
ll
flush
better
i
don
t
see
how
i
m
to
hit
one
this
goose
i
m
carrying
weighs
about
a
ton
the
hunters
hurried
along
crashing
through
the
bushes
they
saw
turkey
after
turkey
went
george
s
gun
then
a
beautiful
sight
made
ken
cry
out
and
forget
to
shoot
six
turkeys
darted
across
an
open
patch
how
swiftly
they
ran
then
rose
in
a
bunch
the
roar
they
made
the
wonderfully
rapid
action
of
their
powerful
wings
and
then
the
size
of
them
their
wildness
and
noble
gameness
made
them
the
royal
game
for
ken
at
the
next
threshing
in
the
bushes
his
gun
was
leveled
he
covered
the
whistling
bronze
thing
that
shot
up
the
turkey
went
down
with
a
crash
pepe
yelled
and
as
he
ran
forward
the
air
all
about
him
was
full
of
fine
bronze
feathers
ken
hurried
forward
to
see
his
bird
its
strength
and
symmetry
and
especially
the
beautiful
shades
of
bronze
captivated
his
eye
come
on
boys
this
is
the
greatest
game
i
ever
hunted
he
called
again
pepe
yelled
and
this
time
he
pointed
from
where
ken
stood
he
could
not
see
anything
except
low
green
bushes
in
great
excitement
george
threw
up
his
gun
and
shot
ken
heard
a
squealing
javelin
javelin
yelled
pepe
in
piercing
alarm
george
jerked
a
rifle
from
him
and
began
to
shoot
hal
pumped
his
into
the
bushes
the
trampling
of
hard
little
hoofs
and
a
cloud
of
dust
warned
ken
where
the
javelin
were
suddenly
pepe
broke
and
fled
for
the
river
hyar
pepe
fetch
back
my
rifle
shouted
ken
angrily
pepe
ran
all
the
faster
george
turned
and
dashed
away
yelling
wild
pigs
wild
pigs
look
out
ken
run
run
added
hal
and
he
likewise
took
to
his
heels
it
looked
as
if
there
was
nothing
else
for
ken
to
do
but
to
make
tracks
from
that
vicinity
never
before
had
he
run
from
a
danger
which
he
had
not
seen
but
the
flight
of
the
boys
was
irresistibly
contagious
and
this
coupled
with
the
many
stories
he
had
heard
of
the
made
ken
execute
a
sprint
that
would
have
been
a
record
but
for
the
hampering
weight
of
gun
and
turkey
he
vowed
he
would
hold
on
to
both
pigs
or
no
pigs
nevertheless
he
listened
as
he
ran
and
nervously
looked
back
often
it
may
have
been
excited
imagination
that
the
appeared
to
be
traveling
in
his
wake
fortunately
the
distance
to
the
river
did
not
exceed
a
short
quarter
of
a
mile
hot
winded
and
thoroughly
disgusted
with
himself
ken
halted
on
the
bank
pepe
was
already
in
the
boat
and
george
was
scrambling
aboard
a
fine
chase
you
ve
given
me
ken
panted
there
s
nothing
after
us
don
t
you
fool
yourself
returned
george
quickly
i
saw
those
pigs
and
like
the
ass
i
am
i
blazed
away
at
one
with
my
shotgun
did
he
run
at
you
that
s
what
i
want
to
know
demanded
ken
george
said
he
was
not
certain
about
that
but
declared
there
always
was
danger
if
a
wounded
squealed
pepe
had
little
to
say
he
refused
to
go
back
after
the
deer
left
in
the
trail
so
they
rowed
across
the
shoal
and
on
the
way
passed
within
a
rod
of
a
big
crocodile
look
at
that
fellow
cried
george
wish
i
had
my
rifle
loaded
he
s
fifteen
feet
long
oh
no
george
he
s
not
more
than
ten
feet
said
ken
you
don
t
see
his
tail
he
s
a
whopper
pepe
told
me
there
was
one
in
this
pool
we
ll
get
him
all
right
they
reached
camp
tired
out
and
all
a
little
ruffled
in
temper
which
certainly
was
not
eased
by
the
discovery
that
they
were
covered
with
ticks
following
the
cue
of
his
companions
ken
hurriedly
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
hung
them
where
they
could
singe
over
the
there
were
broad
red
bands
of
round
both
ankles
and
reddish
patches
on
the
skin
of
his
arms
here
and
there
were
black
spots
about
the
size
of
his
little
and
these
were
he
picked
these
off
one
by
one
rather
surprised
to
find
them
come
off
so
easily
suddenly
he
jumped
straight
up
with
a
pain
as
fierce
as
if
it
had
been
a
puncture
from
a
wire
pepe
grinned
and
george
cried
aha
that
was
a
garrapato
bite
that
was
you
just
wait
george
had
a
hundred
or
more
of
the
big
black
ticks
upon
him
and
he
was
remorselessly
popping
them
with
his
cigarette
some
of
them
were
biting
him
too
judging
from
the
way
he
flinched
pepe
had
attracted
to
himself
a
million
or
more
of
the
but
very
few
of
the
larger
pests
he
generously
came
to
ken
s
assistance
ken
was
trying
to
pull
off
the
that
had
bitten
a
hole
in
him
pepe
said
it
had
embedded
its
head
and
if
pulled
would
come
apart
leaving
the
head
buried
in
the
flesh
which
would
cause
inflammation
pepe
held
the
glowing
end
of
his
cigarette
close
over
the
tick
and
it
began
to
squirm
and
pull
out
its
head
when
it
was
free
of
the
flesh
pepe
suddenly
touched
it
with
the
cigarette
and
it
exploded
with
a
pop
a
difficult
question
was
which
hurt
ken
the
most
the
burn
from
the
cigarette
or
the
bite
of
the
tick
pepe
scraped
off
as
many
as
would
come
and
then
rubbed
ken
with
the
native
alcohol
if
this
was
not
some
kind
of
vitriol
ken
missed
his
guess
it
smarted
so
keenly
he
thought
his
skin
was
peeling
off
presently
however
the
smarting
subsided
and
so
did
the
ticks
hal
who
by
far
was
the
most
sensitive
one
in
regard
to
the
crawling
and
biting
of
the
jungle
pests
had
been
remarkably
fortunate
in
escaping
them
so
he
made
good
use
of
his
opportunity
to
poke
fun
at
the
others
particularly
ken
george
snapped
out
just
wait
hollering
hal
don
t
you
call
me
that
said
hal
belligerently
ken
eyed
his
brother
in
silence
but
with
a
dark
meaning
glance
it
had
occurred
to
ken
that
here
in
this
jungle
was
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
he
could
hope
to
pay
off
old
scores
on
hal
and
plots
began
to
form
in
his
mind
they
lounged
about
camp
resting
in
the
shade
during
the
hot
midday
hours
for
supper
they
had
a
superfluity
of
meat
the
waste
of
which
ken
deplored
and
he
assuaged
his
conscience
by
deciding
to
have
a
taste
of
each
kind
the
wild
turkey
he
found
the
most
toothsome
delicious
meat
it
had
ever
been
his
pleasure
to
eat
what
struck
him
at
once
was
the
flavor
and
he
could
not
understand
it
until
pepe
explained
that
the
jungle
turkey
lived
upon
a
red
pepper
so
the
tamaulipas
wild
turkey
turned
out
to
be
doubly
the
finest
game
he
had
ever
shot
all
afternoon
the
big
crocodile
sunned
himself
on
the
surface
of
the
shoal
ken
wanted
a
and
this
was
a
chance
to
get
one
but
he
thought
it
as
well
to
wait
and
kept
the
boys
from
wasting
ammunition
before
sundown
pepe
went
across
the
river
and
fetched
the
deer
carcass
down
to
the
sandbar
where
the
led
to
the
water
at
twilight
ken
stationed
the
boys
at
the
lower
end
of
the
island
ambushed
behind
stones
he
placed
george
and
pepe
some
rods
below
his
own
position
they
had
george
s
rifle
and
the
loaded
with
a
solid
ball
ken
put
hal
with
the
shotgun
also
loaded
with
ball
some
little
distance
above
and
ken
armed
with
his
automatic
hid
just
opposite
the
be
careful
where
you
shoot
ken
warned
repeatedly
be
cool
think
quick
and
aim
ken
settled
down
for
a
long
wait
some
fifty
yards
from
the
deer
carcass
a
wonderful
procession
of
wild
fowl
winged
swift
flight
over
his
head
they
flew
very
low
it
was
strange
to
note
the
difference
in
the
sound
of
their
flying
the
cranes
and
herons
softly
swished
the
air
the
teal
and
canvasbacks
whirred
by
and
the
great
muscovies
whizzed
like
bullets
when
the
first
deer
came
down
to
drink
it
was
almost
dark
and
when
they
left
the
moon
was
up
though
obscured
by
clouds
faint
sounds
rose
from
the
other
side
of
the
island
ken
listened
until
his
ears
ached
but
he
could
hear
nothing
heavier
clouds
drifted
over
the
moon
the
deer
carcass
became
indistinct
and
then
faded
entirely
and
the
bar
itself
grew
vague
he
was
about
to
give
up
watching
for
that
night
when
he
heard
a
faint
rustling
below
following
it
came
a
grating
or
crunching
of
gravel
bright
flares
split
the
darkness
crack
rang
out
george
s
rifle
then
the
heavy
boom
of
the
shotgun
there
he
is
yelled
george
he
s
down
we
got
him
there
s
two
look
out
boom
roared
the
heavy
shotgun
from
hal
s
covert
george
missed
him
i
got
him
yelled
hal
no
there
he
goes
ken
ken
ken
caught
the
flash
of
a
long
gray
body
in
the
hazy
gloom
of
the
bar
and
took
a
quick
shot
at
it
the
bullet
scattered
the
gravel
and
then
hummed
over
the
bank
the
gray
body
moved
fast
up
the
bank
ken
could
just
see
it
he
turned
loose
the
little
automatic
and
made
the
welkin
ring
fight
with
a
when
the
echoes
of
the
shots
died
away
the
stillness
seemed
all
the
deeper
no
rustle
in
the
brush
or
scuffle
on
the
sand
gave
evidence
of
a
wounded
or
dying
jaguar
george
and
hal
and
pepe
declared
there
were
two
tigers
and
that
they
had
hit
one
ken
walked
out
upon
the
stones
till
he
could
see
the
opposite
bar
but
was
not
rewarded
by
a
sight
of
dead
game
thereupon
they
returned
to
camp
somewhat
discouraged
at
their
ill
luck
but
planning
another
in
the
morning
george
complained
that
he
did
not
feel
well
ken
told
him
he
had
been
eating
too
much
fresh
meat
and
that
he
had
better
be
careful
then
ken
set
off
alone
crossed
the
river
and
found
that
the
deer
carcass
was
gone
in
the
sand
near
where
it
had
lain
were
plenty
of
but
none
of
the
big
jaguar
upon
closer
scrutiny
he
found
the
to
be
those
of
a
panther
he
had
half
dragged
half
carried
the
carcass
up
one
of
the
steep
trails
but
from
that
point
there
was
no
further
trace
ken
struck
out
across
the
fiat
intending
to
go
as
far
as
the
jungle
fluttered
before
him
in
numberless
flocks
far
to
one
side
he
saw
muscovy
ducks
rising
sailing
a
few
rods
then
alighting
this
occurred
several
times
before
he
understood
what
it
meant
there
was
probably
a
large
flock
feeding
on
the
flat
and
the
ones
in
the
rear
were
continually
flying
to
get
ahead
of
those
to
the
fore
several
turkeys
ran
through
the
bushes
before
ken
but
as
he
was
carrying
a
rifle
he
paid
little
heed
to
them
he
kept
a
keen
lookout
for
two
or
three
times
he
was
tempted
to
turn
off
the
trail
into
little
bamboo
hollows
this
however
owing
to
a
repugnance
to
ticks
he
did
not
do
finally
as
he
neared
the
high
wall
of
the
jungle
he
came
upon
a
runway
leading
through
the
bottom
of
a
deep
swale
and
here
he
found
farther
down
the
swale
under
a
great
cluster
of
bamboo
he
saw
the
scattered
bones
of
several
deer
ken
was
sure
that
in
this
spot
the
lord
of
the
jungle
had
feasted
more
than
once
it
was
an
open
hollow
with
the
ground
bare
under
the
bamboos
the
runway
led
on
into
dense
leafy
jungle
ken
planned
to
bait
that
lair
with
a
deer
carcass
and
watch
it
during
the
late
afternoon
first
it
was
necessary
to
get
the
deer
this
might
prove
bothersome
for
ken
s
hands
and
wrists
were
already
sprinkled
with
and
he
certainly
did
not
want
to
stay
very
long
in
the
brush
ken
imagined
he
felt
an
itching
all
the
time
and
writhed
inside
his
clothes
say
blame
you
bite
he
exclaimed
resignedly
and
stepped
into
the
low
bushes
he
went
up
and
out
of
the
swale
scarcely
had
he
reached
a
level
when
he
saw
a
troop
of
deer
within
easy
range
before
they
winded
danger
ken
shot
and
the
one
he
had
singled
out
took
a
few
bounds
then
fell
over
sideways
the
others
ran
off
into
the
brush
ken
remembered
that
the
old
hunter
on
penetier
had
told
him
how
seldom
a
deer
dropped
at
once
when
he
saw
the
work
of
the
bullet
he
no
longer
wondered
at
this
deer
falling
almost
in
his
tracks
if
i
ever
hit
a
jaguar
like
that
it
will
be
all
day
with
him
was
ken
s
comment
there
were
two
things
about
hunting
the
jaguar
that
ken
had
been
bidden
to
keep
in
mind
fierce
aggressiveness
and
remarkable
tenacity
of
life
ken
dragged
the
deer
down
into
the
bamboo
swale
and
skinned
out
a
haunch
next
to
meat
he
liked
venison
best
he
was
glad
to
have
that
as
an
excuse
for
killing
these
tame
tropical
deer
seemed
like
murder
to
ken
he
left
the
carcass
in
a
favorable
place
and
then
hurried
back
to
camp
to
ken
s
relief
he
managed
to
escape
bringing
any
with
him
but
it
took
a
to
rid
himself
of
the
collection
of
george
ask
pepe
what
s
the
difference
between
a
garrapato
and
a
pinilius
said
ken
the
big
tick
is
the
little
one
s
mother
replied
pepe
gee
you
fellows
fuss
a
lot
about
ticks
said
hal
looking
up
from
his
task
he
was
building
more
pens
to
accommodate
the
turtles
snakes
snails
mice
and
young
birds
that
he
had
captured
during
the
morning
pepe
said
there
were
few
ticks
there
in
the
uplands
compared
to
the
number
down
along
the
panuco
river
in
the
lowlands
where
the
cattle
roamed
there
were
millions
in
every
square
rod
the
under
side
of
every
leaf
and
blade
of
grass
was
red
with
ticks
the
size
of
these
pests
depended
on
whether
or
not
they
got
a
chance
to
stick
to
a
steer
or
any
beast
they
appeared
to
live
indefinitely
but
if
they
could
not
suck
blood
they
could
not
grow
the
grew
into
a
and
a
bred
a
hundred
thousand
in
her
body
two
singular
things
concerning
these
ticks
were
that
they
always
crawled
upward
and
they
vanished
from
the
earth
during
the
wet
season
ken
soaked
his
duxbax
in
kerosene
in
the
hope
that
this
method
would
enable
him
to
spend
a
reasonable
time
hunting
then
while
the
other
boys
fished
and
played
around
he
waited
for
the
long
hot
hours
to
pass
it
was
cool
in
the
shade
but
the
sunlight
resembled
the
heat
of
fire
at
last
five
o
clock
came
and
ken
put
on
the
damp
suit
soaked
with
the
oil
it
was
heavier
and
hotter
than
sealskin
and
before
he
got
across
the
river
he
was
nearly
roasted
the
evening
wind
sprang
up
and
the
gusts
were
like
blasts
from
a
furnace
ken
s
body
was
bathed
in
perspiration
it
ran
down
his
wrists
over
his
hands
and
wet
the
gun
this
cure
for
ticks
if
it
were
one
was
worse
than
their
bites
when
he
reached
the
shade
of
the
bamboo
swale
it
was
none
too
soon
for
him
he
threw
off
the
coat
noticing
there
were
more
ticks
upon
it
than
at
anytime
before
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
too
had
gathered
an
exceeding
quantity
he
brushed
them
off
muttering
the
while
that
he
believed
they
liked
kerosene
and
looked
as
if
they
were
drinking
it
ken
found
it
easy
however
to
brush
them
off
the
wet
duxbax
and
soon
composed
himself
to
rest
and
watch
the
position
chosen
afforded
ken
a
clear
view
of
the
bare
space
under
the
bamboos
and
of
the
hollow
where
the
runway
disappeared
in
the
jungle
the
deer
carcass
which
lay
as
he
had
left
it
was
about
a
hundred
feet
from
him
this
seemed
rather
close
but
he
had
to
accept
it
for
if
he
had
moved
farther
away
he
could
not
have
commanded
both
points
ken
sat
with
his
back
against
a
clump
of
bamboos
the
little
rifle
across
his
knees
and
an
extra
clip
of
cartridges
on
the
ground
at
his
left
after
taking
that
position
he
determined
not
to
move
a
yard
when
the
tiger
came
and
to
kill
him
ken
went
over
in
mind
the
lessons
he
had
learned
hunting
bear
in
penetier
forest
with
old
hiram
bent
and
lassoing
lions
on
the
wild
of
the
grand
cañon
ken
knew
that
the
thing
for
a
hunter
to
do
when
his
quarry
was
dangerous
was
to
make
up
his
mind
beforehand
ken
had
twelve
powerful
shells
that
he
could
shoot
in
the
half
of
twelve
seconds
he
would
have
been
willing
to
face
two
jaguars
the
sun
set
and
the
wind
died
down
what
a
relief
was
the
cooling
shade
the
little
breeze
that
was
left
fortunately
blew
at
right
angles
to
the
swale
so
that
there
did
not
seem
much
danger
of
the
tiger
winding
ken
down
the
jungle
runway
for
long
moments
he
was
tense
and
alert
he
listened
till
he
thought
he
had
almost
lost
the
sense
of
hearing
the
jungle
leaves
were
whispering
the
insects
were
humming
he
had
expected
to
hear
myriad
birds
and
see
processions
of
deer
and
perhaps
a
drove
of
but
if
any
living
creatures
ventured
near
him
it
was
without
his
knowledge
the
hour
between
sunset
and
twilight
passed
a
long
wait
still
he
did
not
lose
the
feeling
that
something
would
happen
ken
s
faculties
of
alertness
tired
however
and
needed
distraction
so
he
took
stock
of
the
big
clump
of
bamboos
under
which
lay
the
deer
carcass
it
was
a
remarkable
growth
that
gracefully
drooping
cluster
of
slender
bamboo
poles
he
remembered
how
as
a
youngster
not
many
years
back
he
had
wondered
where
the
came
from
here
ken
counted
one
hundred
and
in
a
clump
no
larger
than
a
barrel
they
were
yellow
in
color
with
black
bands
and
they
rose
straight
for
a
few
yards
then
began
to
lean
out
to
bend
slightly
at
last
to
droop
with
their
abundance
of
spiked
leaves
ken
was
getting
down
to
a
real
interested
study
of
this
species
of
jungle
growth
when
a
noise
startled
him
he
straightened
out
of
his
lounging
position
and
looked
around
the
sound
puzzled
him
he
could
not
place
its
direction
or
name
what
it
was
the
jungle
seemed
strangely
quiet
he
listened
after
a
moment
of
waiting
he
again
heard
the
sound
instantly
ken
was
as
tense
and
vibrating
as
a
violin
string
the
thing
he
had
heard
was
from
the
lungs
of
some
jungle
beast
he
was
almost
ready
to
pronounce
it
a
cough
warily
he
glanced
around
craning
his
neck
then
a
deep
hoarse
growl
made
him
whirl
there
stood
a
jaguar
with
head
up
and
paw
on
the
deer
carcass
ken
imagined
he
felt
perfectly
cool
but
he
knew
he
was
astounded
and
even
as
he
cautiously
edged
the
rifle
over
his
knee
he
took
in
the
beautiful
points
of
the
jaguar
he
was
yellow
almost
white
with
black
spots
he
was
short
and
stocky
with
powerful
stumpy
but
his
head
most
amazed
ken
it
was
enormous
and
the
expression
of
his
face
was
so
singularly
savage
and
wild
that
ken
seemed
to
realize
instantly
the
difference
between
a
and
this
fierce
tropical
brute
the
jaguar
opened
his
jaws
threateningly
he
had
an
enormous
stretch
of
jaw
his
long
yellow
fangs
gleamed
he
growled
again
not
hurriedly
nor
yet
slowly
ken
fired
he
heard
the
bullet
strike
him
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
hit
him
with
a
board
he
saw
dust
fly
from
his
hide
ken
expected
to
see
the
jaguar
roll
over
instead
of
that
he
leaped
straight
up
with
a
terrible
roar
something
within
ken
shook
he
felt
cold
and
sick
when
the
jaguar
came
down
sprawled
on
all
fours
ken
pulled
the
automatic
again
and
he
saw
the
fur
fly
then
the
jaguar
leaped
forward
with
a
strange
hoarse
cry
ken
shot
again
and
knocked
the
beast
flat
he
tumbled
and
wrestled
about
scattering
the
dust
and
brush
three
times
more
ken
fired
too
hastily
and
inflicted
only
slight
wounds
in
reloading
ken
tried
to
be
deliberate
in
snapping
in
the
second
clip
and
pushing
down
the
rod
that
threw
the
shell
into
the
barrel
but
his
hands
shook
his
fingers
were
all
thumbs
and
he
fumbled
at
the
breech
of
the
rifle
in
that
interval
if
the
jaguar
could
have
kept
his
sense
of
direction
he
would
have
reached
ken
but
the
beast
zigzagged
he
had
lost
his
equilibrium
he
was
hard
hit
then
he
leaped
magnificently
he
landed
within
feet
of
ken
and
when
he
plunged
down
he
rolled
clear
over
ken
shot
him
through
and
through
yet
he
got
up
wheezing
blood
uttering
a
hoarse
bellow
and
made
again
at
ken
ken
had
been
cold
sick
now
panic
almost
overpowered
him
the
rifle
wabbled
the
bamboo
glade
blurred
in
his
sight
a
terrible
dizziness
and
numbness
almost
paralyzed
him
he
was
weakening
sinking
when
thought
of
life
at
stake
lent
him
a
momentary
grim
and
desperate
spirit
once
while
the
jaguar
was
in
the
air
ken
pulled
twice
while
he
was
down
then
the
jaguar
stood
up
pawing
the
air
with
great
spread
claws
coughing
bleeding
roaring
he
was
horrible
ken
shot
him
straight
between
the
paws
with
twisted
body
staggering
and
blowing
bloody
froth
all
over
ken
the
big
tiger
blindly
lunged
forward
and
crashed
to
earth
then
began
a
furious
wrestling
ken
imagined
it
was
the
of
the
jaguar
ken
could
not
see
him
down
among
the
leaves
and
vines
nevertheless
he
shot
into
the
commotion
the
struggles
ceased
then
a
movement
of
the
weeds
showed
ken
that
the
jaguar
was
creeping
toward
the
jungle
ken
fell
rather
than
sat
down
he
found
he
was
wringing
wet
with
cold
sweat
he
was
panting
hard
say
but
that
was
awful
he
gasped
what
was
wrong
with
me
he
began
to
reload
the
clips
they
were
difficult
to
load
for
even
a
calm
person
and
now
in
the
reaction
ken
was
the
farthest
removed
from
calm
the
jaguar
crept
steadily
away
as
ken
could
tell
by
the
swaying
weeds
and
shaking
vines
what
a
beast
muttered
ken
i
must
have
shot
him
all
to
pieces
yet
he
s
getting
away
from
me
at
last
ken
s
trembling
fingers
pushed
some
shells
in
the
two
clips
and
once
more
he
reloaded
the
rifle
then
he
stood
up
drew
a
deep
full
breath
and
made
a
strong
effort
at
composure
i
ve
shot
at
bear
and
deer
and
lions
out
west
said
ken
but
this
was
different
i
ll
never
get
over
it
how
close
that
jaguar
came
to
reaching
ken
was
proved
by
the
blood
coughed
into
his
face
he
recalled
that
he
had
felt
the
wind
of
one
great
sweeping
paw
ken
regained
his
courage
and
determination
he
meant
to
have
that
beautiful
spotted
skin
for
his
den
so
he
hurried
along
the
runway
and
entered
the
jungle
beyond
the
edge
where
the
bushes
made
a
dense
thicket
it
was
dry
forest
with
little
green
low
down
the
hollow
gave
place
to
a
dry
wash
he
could
not
see
the
jaguar
but
he
could
hear
him
dragging
himself
through
the
brush
cracking
sticks
shaking
saplings
presently
ken
ran
across
a
bloody
trail
and
followed
it
every
little
while
he
would
stop
to
listen
when
the
wounded
jaguar
was
still
he
waited
until
he
started
to
move
again
it
was
hard
going
the
brush
was
thick
and
had
to
be
broken
and
crawled
under
or
through
as
ken
had
left
his
coat
behind
his
shirt
was
soon
torn
to
rags
he
peered
ahead
with
sharp
eyes
expecting
every
minute
to
come
in
sight
of
the
poor
crippled
beast
he
wanted
to
put
him
out
of
agony
so
he
kept
on
doggedly
for
what
must
have
been
a
long
time
the
first
premonition
he
had
of
carelessness
was
to
note
that
the
shadows
were
gathering
in
the
jungle
it
would
soon
be
night
he
must
turn
back
while
there
was
light
enough
to
follow
his
back
track
out
to
the
open
the
second
came
in
shape
of
a
hot
pain
in
his
arm
as
keen
as
if
he
had
jagged
it
with
a
thorn
holding
it
out
he
discovered
to
his
dismay
that
it
was
spotted
with
vicious
at
once
ken
turned
back
and
if
he
thought
again
of
the
jaguar
it
was
that
he
could
come
after
him
the
next
day
or
send
pepe
another
vicious
bite
this
time
on
his
leg
confirmed
his
suspicions
that
many
of
the
ticks
had
been
on
him
long
enough
to
get
their
heads
in
then
he
was
bitten
in
several
places
those
bites
were
as
hot
as
the
touch
of
a
live
coal
yet
they
made
ken
break
out
in
dripping
cold
sweat
it
was
imperative
that
he
get
back
to
camp
without
losing
a
moment
which
could
be
saved
from
a
rapid
walk
he
fell
into
a
trot
he
got
off
his
back
trail
and
had
to
hunt
for
it
every
time
a
tick
bit
he
jumped
as
if
stung
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
knew
he
was
collecting
more
with
almost
every
step
when
he
grasped
a
dead
branch
to
push
it
out
of
the
way
he
could
feel
the
ticks
cling
to
his
hand
then
he
would
whip
his
arm
in
the
air
flinging
some
of
them
off
to
patter
on
the
dry
ground
impossible
as
it
was
to
run
through
that
matted
jungle
ken
almost
accomplished
it
when
he
got
out
into
the
open
he
did
run
not
even
stopping
for
his
coat
and
he
crossed
the
flat
at
top
speed
it
was
almost
dark
when
ken
reached
the
and
dashed
down
to
frighten
a
herd
of
drinking
deer
he
waded
the
narrowest
part
of
the
shoal
running
up
the
island
he
burst
into
the
bright
circle
of
pepe
dropped
a
and
began
to
jabber
george
dove
for
a
gun
what
s
after
you
shouted
hal
in
alarm
ken
was
so
choked
up
and
breathless
that
at
first
he
could
not
speak
his
fierce
aspect
and
actions
as
he
tore
off
his
sleeveless
and
ragged
shirt
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
added
to
the
boys
fright
good
lord
are
you
ken
shrieked
hal
yes
roared
ken
swiftly
undressing
look
at
me
in
the
bright
glare
he
showed
his
arms
black
with
and
a
sprinkling
of
black
dots
over
the
rest
of
his
body
is
that
all
demanded
hal
in
real
or
simulated
scorn
gee
but
you
re
a
brave
hunter
i
thought
not
less
than
six
tigers
were
after
you
i
d
rather
have
six
tigers
after
me
yelled
ken
you
little
redhead
it
was
seldom
indeed
that
ken
called
his
brother
that
name
hal
was
proof
against
any
epithets
except
that
one
relating
to
his
freckles
and
his
hair
but
just
now
ken
felt
that
he
was
being
eaten
alive
he
was
in
an
agony
and
he
lost
his
temper
and
therefore
he
laid
himself
open
to
hal
s
scathing
humor
never
mind
the
kid
said
ken
to
pepe
and
george
hurry
now
and
get
busy
with
these
devils
on
me
it
was
well
for
ken
that
he
had
a
native
like
pepe
with
him
for
pepe
knew
just
what
to
do
first
he
dashed
a
bucket
of
cold
water
over
ken
how
welcome
that
was
pepe
says
for
you
to
point
out
the
ticks
that
re
biting
the
hardest
said
george
in
spite
of
his
pain
ken
stared
in
mute
surprise
pepe
wants
you
to
point
out
the
ticks
that
are
digging
in
the
deepest
explained
george
get
a
move
on
now
what
roared
ken
glaring
at
pepe
and
george
he
thought
even
the
native
might
be
having
fun
with
him
and
for
ken
this
was
not
a
funny
time
but
pepe
was
in
dead
earnest
say
it
s
impossible
to
tell
i
m
being
bitten
most
it
s
all
over
protested
ken
still
he
discovered
that
by
absolute
concentration
on
the
pain
he
was
enduring
he
was
able
to
locate
the
severest
points
and
that
showed
him
the
soundness
of
pepe
s
advice
here
this
one
here
there
oh
here
began
ken
indicating
certain
ticks
not
so
fast
now
interrupted
the
imperturbable
george
as
he
and
pepe
set
to
work
upon
ken
then
the
scorched
ken
s
skin
ken
kept
pointing
and
accompanying
his
directions
with
wild
gestures
and
exclamations
here
here
wow
here
ouch
that
one
stung
here
say
can
t
you
hurry
here
oh
that
one
was
in
a
mile
here
you
re
burning
a
hole
in
me
george
you
re
having
fun
out
of
this
pepe
gets
two
to
your
one
he
s
been
popping
ticks
all
his
life
was
george
s
reasonable
protest
hurry
cried
ken
in
desperation
george
if
you
monkey
round
fool
over
this
job
i
ll
i
ll
punch
you
good
all
this
trying
time
hal
ward
sat
on
a
log
and
watched
the
proceedings
with
great
interest
and
humor
sometimes
he
smiled
at
others
he
laughed
and
yet
again
he
burst
out
into
uproarious
mirth
george
he
wouldn
t
punch
anybody
said
hal
i
tell
you
he
s
all
in
he
hasn
t
any
nerve
left
it
s
a
chance
of
your
life
you
ll
never
get
another
he
s
been
bossing
you
around
pay
him
up
make
him
holler
why
what
s
a
few
little
ticks
wouldn
t
phase
me
but
ken
ward
s
such
a
delicate
sensitive
girly
kind
of
a
boy
he
s
too
nice
to
be
bitten
by
bugs
oh
dear
yes
yes
ken
why
don
t
you
show
courage
ken
shook
his
fist
at
hal
all
right
said
ken
grimly
have
all
the
fun
you
can
because
i
ll
get
even
with
you
hal
relapsed
into
silence
and
ken
began
to
believe
he
had
intimidated
his
brother
but
he
soon
realized
how
foolish
it
was
to
suppose
such
a
thing
hal
had
only
been
working
his
fertile
brain
george
here
s
a
little
verse
for
the
occasion
said
hal
there
was
a
brave
hunter
named
ken
and
he
loved
to
get
skins
for
his
den
not
afraid
was
he
of
tigers
or
pigs
or
snakes
or
cats
or
any
such
things
but
one
day
in
the
jungle
he
left
his
clothes
and
came
hollering
back
with
sputtered
ken
oh
brother
mine
we
re
a
long
way
from
home
i
ll
make
you
crawl
pepe
smoked
and
wore
out
three
cigarettes
and
george
two
before
they
had
popped
all
the
biting
ticks
then
ken
was
still
covered
with
them
pepe
bathed
him
in
which
was
like
a
bath
of
fire
and
soon
removed
them
all
ken
felt
flayed
alive
peeled
of
his
skin
and
sprinkled
with
fiery
sparks
when
he
lay
down
he
was
as
weak
as
a
sick
cat
pepe
said
the
would
very
soon
take
the
sting
away
but
it
was
some
time
before
ken
was
resting
easily
it
would
not
have
been
fair
to
ask
ken
just
then
whether
the
prize
for
which
he
worked
was
worth
his
present
gain
may
not
seem
important
to
one
who
simply
reads
about
them
but
such
pests
are
a
formidable
feature
of
tropical
life
however
ken
presently
felt
that
he
was
himself
again
then
he
put
his
mind
to
the
serious
problem
of
his
and
the
plotting
of
the
island
as
far
as
his
trip
was
concerned
cypress
island
was
an
important
point
when
he
had
completed
his
map
down
to
the
island
he
went
on
to
his
notes
he
believed
that
what
he
had
found
out
from
his
knowledge
of
forestry
was
really
worth
something
he
had
seen
a
gradual
increase
in
the
size
and
number
of
trees
as
he
had
proceeded
down
the
river
a
difference
in
the
density
and
color
of
the
jungle
a
of
the
mountain
range
and
a
gradual
change
from
rocky
to
clayey
soil
and
on
the
whole
his
began
to
assume
such
a
character
that
he
was
beginning
to
feel
willing
to
submit
it
to
his
uncle
work
of
a
that
night
ken
talked
natural
history
to
the
boys
and
read
extracts
from
a
small
copy
of
sclater
he
had
brought
with
him
they
were
all
particularly
interested
in
the
cat
tribe
the
fore
feet
of
all
cats
have
five
toes
the
hind
feet
only
four
their
claws
are
curved
and
sharp
and
except
in
case
of
one
species
of
leopard
can
be
retracted
in
their
sheaths
the
claws
of
the
great
cat
species
are
kept
sharp
by
pulling
them
down
through
bark
of
trees
all
cats
walk
on
their
toes
and
the
stealthy
walk
is
due
to
hairy
pads
or
cushions
the
claws
of
a
cat
do
not
show
in
its
track
as
do
those
of
a
dog
the
tongues
of
all
cats
are
furnished
with
large
papillæ
they
are
like
files
and
the
use
is
to
lick
bones
and
clean
their
fur
their
long
whiskers
are
delicate
organs
of
perception
to
aid
them
in
finding
their
way
on
their
night
quests
the
eyes
of
all
cats
are
large
and
full
and
can
be
altered
by
contraction
or
expansion
of
iris
according
to
the
amount
of
light
they
receive
the
usual
color
is
gray
or
tawny
with
dark
spots
or
stripes
the
uniform
tawny
color
of
the
lion
and
the
panther
is
perhaps
an
acquired
color
probably
from
the
habit
of
these
animals
of
living
in
desert
countries
it
is
likely
that
in
primitive
times
cats
were
all
spotted
or
striped
naturally
the
boys
were
most
interested
in
the
jaguar
which
is
the
largest
of
the
cat
tribe
in
the
new
world
the
jaguar
ranges
from
northern
mexico
to
northern
patagonia
its
spots
are
larger
than
those
of
the
leopard
their
ground
color
is
a
rich
tan
or
yellow
sometimes
almost
gold
large
specimens
have
been
known
nearly
seven
feet
from
nose
to
end
of
tail
the
jaguar
is
an
expert
climber
and
swimmer
humboldt
says
that
where
the
south
american
forests
are
subject
to
floods
the
jaguar
sometimes
takes
to
tree
life
living
on
monkeys
all
naturalists
agree
on
the
ferocious
nature
of
jaguars
and
on
the
loudness
and
frequency
of
their
cries
there
is
no
record
of
their
attacking
human
beings
without
provocation
their
favorite
haunts
are
the
banks
of
jungle
rivers
and
they
often
prey
upon
fish
and
turtles
the
attack
of
a
jaguar
is
terrible
it
leaps
on
the
back
of
its
prey
and
breaks
its
neck
in
some
places
there
are
scratching
trees
where
jaguars
sharpen
their
claws
the
bark
is
worn
smooth
in
front
from
contact
with
the
breasts
of
the
animals
as
they
stand
up
and
there
is
a
deep
groove
on
each
side
when
new
scars
appear
on
these
trees
it
is
known
that
jaguars
are
in
the
vicinity
the
cry
of
the
jaguar
is
loud
deep
hoarse
something
like
pu
there
is
much
enmity
between
the
panther
or
and
the
jaguar
and
it
is
very
strange
that
generally
the
jaguar
fears
the
lion
although
he
is
larger
and
more
powerful
pepe
had
interesting
things
to
say
about
jaguars
or
as
he
called
them
but
ken
of
course
could
not
tell
how
much
pepe
said
was
truth
and
how
much
just
native
talk
at
any
rate
pepe
told
of
one
mexican
who
had
a
blind
and
deaf
jaguar
that
he
had
tamed
ken
knew
that
naturalists
claimed
the
jaguar
could
not
be
tamed
but
in
this
instance
ken
was
inclined
to
believe
pepe
this
blind
jaguar
was
enormous
in
size
terrible
of
aspect
and
had
been
trained
to
trail
anything
his
master
set
him
to
and
tigre
as
he
was
called
never
slept
or
stopped
till
he
had
killed
the
thing
he
was
trailing
as
he
was
blind
and
deaf
his
power
of
scent
had
been
abnormally
developed
pepe
told
of
a
fight
between
a
huge
crocodile
and
a
jaguar
in
which
both
were
killed
he
said
jaguars
stalked
natives
and
had
absolutely
no
fear
he
knew
natives
who
said
that
jaguars
had
made
off
with
children
and
eaten
them
lastly
pepe
told
of
an
incident
that
had
happened
in
tampico
the
year
before
there
was
a
ship
at
dock
below
tampico
just
on
the
outskirts
where
the
jungle
began
and
one
day
at
noon
two
big
jaguars
leaped
on
the
deck
they
frightened
the
crew
out
of
their
wits
george
verified
this
story
and
added
that
the
jaguars
had
been
chased
by
dogs
had
boarded
the
ship
where
they
climbed
into
the
rigging
and
stayed
there
till
they
were
shot
well
said
ken
thoughtfully
from
my
experience
i
believe
a
jaguar
would
do
anything
the
following
day
promised
to
be
a
busy
one
for
hal
without
any
time
for
tricks
george
went
hunting
before
breakfast
in
fact
before
the
others
were
up
and
just
as
the
boys
were
sitting
down
to
eat
he
appeared
on
the
nearer
bank
and
yelled
for
pepe
it
developed
that
for
once
george
had
bagged
game
he
had
a
black
squirrel
a
small
striped
wildcat
a
peccary
a
crocodile
and
a
duck
of
rare
plumage
after
breakfast
hal
straightway
got
busy
and
his
skill
and
knowledge
earned
praise
from
george
and
pepe
they
volunteered
to
help
which
offer
hal
gratefully
accepted
he
had
brought
along
a
folding
canvas
tank
forceps
knives
scissors
several
packages
of
preservatives
and
tin
boxes
in
which
to
pack
small
skins
his
first
task
was
to
mix
a
salt
solution
in
the
canvas
tank
this
was
for
immersing
skins
then
he
made
a
paste
of
salt
and
alum
and
after
that
a
mixture
of
glycerin
and
water
and
carbolic
acid
which
was
for
preserving
small
skins
and
to
keep
them
soft
and
as
he
worked
he
gave
george
directions
on
how
to
proceed
with
the
wildcat
and
squirrel
skins
skin
carefully
and
tack
up
the
pelts
fur
side
down
scrape
off
all
the
fat
and
oil
but
don
t
scrape
through
when
the
skins
are
dry
soak
them
in
cold
water
till
soft
then
take
them
out
and
squeeze
dry
i
ll
make
a
solution
of
three
quarts
water
pint
salt
and
one
ounce
oil
of
vitriol
put
the
skins
in
that
for
half
an
hour
squeeze
dry
again
and
hang
in
shade
that
ll
tan
the
skin
and
the
moths
will
never
hurt
them
when
hal
came
to
take
up
the
duck
he
was
sorry
that
some
of
the
beautiful
plumage
had
been
stained
i
want
only
a
few
he
said
and
particularly
one
of
the
big
muscovies
and
you
must
keep
the
feathers
from
getting
soiled
it
was
interesting
to
watch
hal
handle
that
specimen
first
he
took
full
measurements
then
separating
the
feathers
along
the
breast
he
made
an
incision
with
a
sharp
knife
beginning
high
up
on
and
ending
at
tail
he
exercised
care
so
as
not
to
cut
through
the
abdomen
raising
the
skin
carefully
along
the
cut
as
far
as
the
muscles
of
the
leg
he
pushed
out
the
knee
joint
and
cut
it
off
then
he
loosened
the
skin
from
the
legs
and
the
back
and
bent
the
tail
down
to
cut
through
the
tail
joint
next
he
removed
the
skin
from
the
body
and
cut
off
the
wings
at
the
shoulder
joint
then
he
proceeded
down
the
neck
being
careful
not
to
pull
or
stretch
the
skin
extreme
care
was
necessary
in
cutting
round
the
eyes
then
when
he
had
loosened
the
skin
from
the
skull
he
severed
the
head
and
cleaned
out
the
skull
he
coated
all
with
the
paste
filled
the
skull
with
cotton
and
then
immersed
them
in
the
glycerin
bath
the
skinning
of
the
crocodile
was
an
easy
matter
compared
with
that
of
the
duck
hal
made
an
incision
at
the
throat
cut
along
the
middle
of
the
abdomen
all
the
way
to
the
tip
of
the
tail
and
then
cut
the
skin
away
all
around
the
carcass
then
he
set
george
and
pepe
to
scraping
the
skin
after
which
he
immersed
it
in
the
tank
about
that
time
ken
who
was
lazily
fishing
in
the
shade
of
the
cypresses
caught
one
of
the
fish
hal
was
delighted
he
had
made
a
failure
of
the
other
specimen
of
this
unknown
fish
this
one
was
larger
and
exquisitely
marked
being
dark
gold
on
the
back
white
along
the
belly
and
its
tail
had
a
faint
bluish
tinge
hal
promptly
killed
the
fish
and
then
made
a
dive
for
his
suitcase
he
produced
several
sheets
of
stiff
cardboard
and
a
small
box
of
and
brushes
he
laid
the
fish
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
outlined
its
exact
size
then
placing
it
carefully
in
an
upright
position
on
a
box
he
began
to
paint
it
in
the
actual
colors
of
the
moment
ken
laughed
and
teased
him
george
also
was
inclined
to
be
amused
but
pepe
was
amazed
and
delighted
hal
worked
on
unmindful
of
his
audience
and
though
he
did
not
paint
a
very
artistic
picture
he
produced
the
vivid
colors
of
the
fish
before
they
faded
his
next
move
was
to
cover
the
fish
with
strips
of
thin
cloth
which
adhered
to
the
scales
and
kept
them
from
being
damaged
then
he
cut
along
the
middle
line
of
the
belly
divided
the
pelvic
arch
where
the
ventral
fins
joined
cut
through
the
spines
and
severed
the
fins
from
the
bones
then
he
skinned
down
to
the
tail
up
to
the
back
and
cut
through
caudal
processes
the
vertebral
column
he
severed
at
the
base
of
the
skull
he
cleaned
and
scraped
the
entire
inside
of
the
skin
and
then
put
it
to
soak
hal
you
re
much
more
likely
to
make
good
with
uncle
jim
than
i
am
said
ken
you
ve
really
got
skill
and
you
know
what
to
do
now
my
job
is
different
so
far
i
ve
done
fairly
well
with
my
map
of
the
river
but
as
soon
as
we
get
on
level
ground
i
ll
be
stumped
we
ll
cover
a
hundred
miles
before
we
get
to
low
land
replied
hal
cheerily
that
s
enough
even
if
we
do
get
lost
for
the
rest
of
the
way
you
ll
win
that
trip
abroad
ken
never
fear
and
little
willie
is
going
to
be
with
you
next
morning
hal
arose
bright
as
a
lark
but
silent
mysterious
and
with
eyes
it
made
ken
groan
in
spirit
to
look
at
the
boy
yes
indeed
they
were
far
from
home
and
the
person
did
not
live
on
the
earth
who
could
play
a
trick
on
hal
ward
and
escape
vengeance
after
breakfast
hal
went
off
with
a
obviously
to
capture
birds
or
fish
or
mice
or
something
george
said
he
did
not
feel
very
well
and
he
looked
grouchy
he
growled
around
camp
in
a
way
that
might
have
nettled
ken
but
ken
having
had
ten
hours
of
undisturbed
sleep
could
not
have
found
fault
with
anybody
garrapato
george
come
out
of
it
cheer
up
said
ken
why
don
t
you
take
pinilius
pepe
as
and
go
out
to
shoot
something
you
haven
t
used
up
much
ammunition
yet
ken
s
sarcasm
was
not
lost
upon
george
well
if
i
do
go
i
ll
not
come
running
back
to
camp
without
some
game
my
son
replied
ken
genially
if
you
should
happen
to
meet
a
jaguar
you
d
you
d
just
let
out
one
squawk
and
then
never
touch
even
the
high
places
of
the
jungle
you
d
take
that
crazy
rifle
for
a
would
i
returned
george
all
right
ken
watched
george
awhile
that
morning
the
lad
performed
a
lot
of
weird
things
around
camp
then
he
bounced
bullets
off
the
water
in
vain
effort
to
locate
the
basking
crocodile
then
he
tried
his
hand
at
fishing
once
more
he
could
get
more
bites
than
any
fisherman
ken
ever
saw
but
he
could
not
catch
anything
by
and
by
the
heat
made
ken
drowsy
and
stretching
himself
in
the
shade
he
thought
of
a
scheme
to
rid
the
camp
of
the
noisy
george
say
george
take
my
hammerless
and
get
pepe
to
row
you
up
along
the
shady
bank
of
the
river
suggested
ken
go
sneaking
along
and
you
ll
have
some
sport
george
was
delighted
with
that
idea
he
had
often
cast
longing
eyes
at
the
hammerless
gun
pepe
too
looked
exceedingly
pleased
they
got
in
the
boat
and
were
in
the
act
of
starting
when
george
jumped
ashore
he
reached
for
his
and
threw
the
lever
down
to
see
if
there
was
a
shell
in
the
chamber
then
he
proceeded
to
fill
his
pockets
with
ammunition
might
need
a
rifle
he
said
you
can
t
tell
what
you
re
going
to
see
in
this
unholy
jungle
whereupon
he
went
aboard
again
and
pepe
rowed
leisurely
be
careful
boys
ken
called
and
composed
himself
for
a
nap
he
promptly
fell
asleep
how
long
he
slept
he
had
no
idea
and
when
he
awoke
he
lay
with
languor
not
knowing
at
the
moment
what
had
awakened
him
presently
he
heard
a
shout
then
a
sitting
up
he
saw
the
boat
some
two
hundred
yards
above
drifting
along
about
the
edge
of
the
shade
pepe
was
in
it
alone
he
appeared
to
be
excited
for
ken
observed
him
lay
down
an
oar
and
pick
up
a
gun
and
then
reverse
the
performance
also
he
was
jabbering
to
george
who
evidently
was
out
on
the
bank
but
invisible
to
ken
hey
pepe
ken
yelled
what
re
you
doing
strange
to
note
pepe
did
not
reply
or
even
turn
now
where
in
the
deuce
is
george
ken
said
impatiently
the
hollow
crack
of
george
s
was
a
reply
to
the
question
ken
heard
the
singing
of
a
bullet
suddenly
it
twanged
on
a
branch
not
twenty
feet
over
his
head
and
then
went
whining
away
he
heard
it
tick
a
few
leaves
or
twigs
there
was
not
any
languor
in
the
alacrity
with
which
ken
put
the
big
between
him
and
then
he
ventured
to
peep
forth
look
out
where
you
re
slinging
lead
he
yelled
he
doubted
not
that
george
had
treed
a
black
squirrel
or
was
pegging
away
at
parrots
yet
pepe
s
motions
appeared
to
carry
a
good
deal
of
feeling
too
much
he
thought
presently
for
small
game
so
ken
began
to
wake
up
thoroughly
he
lost
sight
of
pepe
behind
a
low
branch
of
a
tree
that
leaned
some
fifty
yards
above
the
island
then
he
caught
sight
of
him
again
he
was
poling
with
an
oar
evidently
trying
to
go
up
or
down
ken
could
not
tell
which
george
s
spoke
twice
more
and
the
bullets
both
struck
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
ricochetted
into
the
far
bank
with
little
thuds
something
prompted
ken
to
reach
for
his
automatic
snap
the
clip
in
tight
and
push
in
the
safety
at
the
same
time
he
muttered
george
s
words
you
can
never
tell
what
s
coming
off
in
this
unholy
jungle
then
peeping
out
from
behind
the
cypress
ken
watched
the
boat
drift
pepe
had
stopped
poling
and
was
looking
closely
into
the
thick
grass
and
vines
of
the
bank
ken
heard
his
voice
but
could
not
tell
what
he
said
he
watched
keenly
for
some
sight
of
george
the
moments
passed
the
boat
drifted
and
ken
began
to
think
there
was
nothing
unusual
afoot
in
this
interval
pepe
drifted
within
yards
of
camp
again
ken
called
to
ask
him
what
george
was
stalking
and
this
time
pepe
yelled
but
ken
did
not
know
what
he
said
hard
upon
this
came
george
s
sharp
voice
look
out
there
on
the
island
get
behind
something
i
ve
got
him
between
the
river
and
the
flat
he
s
in
this
strip
of
shore
brush
there
bullets
hummed
and
whistled
all
about
the
island
ken
was
afraid
to
peep
out
with
even
one
eye
he
began
to
fancy
that
george
was
playing
indian
fine
georgie
you
re
doing
great
he
shouted
you
couldn
t
come
any
closer
to
me
if
you
were
aiming
at
me
what
is
it
then
a
crashing
of
brush
and
a
flash
of
yellow
low
down
along
the
bank
changed
the
aspect
of
the
situation
panther
or
jaguar
ken
ejaculated
in
amaze
in
a
second
he
was
cold
and
at
that
instant
he
saw
george
s
white
shirt
about
the
top
of
the
brush
go
back
get
out
in
the
open
ken
ordered
do
you
hear
me
where
is
he
shouted
george
paying
not
the
slightest
attention
to
ken
ken
jumped
from
behind
the
tree
and
running
to
the
head
of
the
island
he
knelt
low
near
the
water
with
rifle
ready
tigre
tigre
tigre
screamed
pepe
waving
his
arms
then
pointing
george
crashed
into
the
brush
ken
saw
the
leaves
move
then
a
long
yellow
shape
with
the
quickness
of
thought
and
the
aim
of
the
ken
fired
from
the
brush
rose
a
strange
wild
scream
george
aimed
at
a
shaking
mass
of
grass
and
vines
but
before
he
could
fire
a
long
lean
ugly
beast
leaped
straight
out
from
the
bank
to
drop
into
the
water
with
a
heavy
splash
like
a
man
half
scared
to
death
pepe
waved
ken
s
gun
then
a
yellow
head
emerged
from
the
water
it
was
in
line
with
the
boat
ken
dared
not
shoot
kill
him
george
yelled
ken
tell
pepe
to
kill
him
george
seemed
unaccountably
silent
but
ken
had
no
time
to
look
for
him
for
his
eyes
were
riveted
on
pepe
the
native
did
not
know
how
to
hold
a
gun
properly
let
alone
aim
it
he
had
however
sense
enough
to
try
he
got
the
stock
under
his
chin
and
pointing
the
gun
he
evidently
tried
to
fire
but
the
hammerless
did
not
go
off
then
pepe
fumbled
at
the
which
he
evidently
remembered
seeing
ken
use
the
jaguar
swimming
with
difficulty
perhaps
badly
wounded
made
right
for
the
boat
pepe
was
standing
on
the
seat
awkwardly
he
aimed
he
had
pulled
both
triggers
the
recoil
knocked
him
backward
the
hammerless
fell
in
the
boat
and
pepe
s
broad
back
hit
the
water
his
bare
muscular
legs
clung
to
the
gunwale
and
slipped
loose
he
had
missed
the
jaguar
for
it
kept
on
toward
the
boat
still
ken
dared
not
shoot
george
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
you
shouted
ken
then
ken
saw
him
standing
in
the
brush
on
the
bank
fussing
over
the
crazy
of
course
at
the
critical
moment
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
old
rifle
pepe
s
head
bobbed
up
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
boat
the
jaguar
was
scarcely
twenty
feet
distant
and
now
in
line
with
both
boat
and
man
at
that
instant
a
heavy
swirl
in
the
water
toward
the
middle
of
the
river
drew
ken
s
attention
he
saw
the
big
crocodile
and
the
great
creature
did
not
seem
at
all
lazy
at
that
moment
george
began
to
scream
in
spanish
ken
felt
his
hair
stiffen
and
his
face
blanch
pepe
who
had
been
solely
occupied
with
the
jaguar
caught
george
s
meaning
and
turned
to
see
the
peril
in
his
rear
he
bawled
his
familiar
appeal
to
the
saints
then
he
grasped
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
just
as
it
swung
against
the
branches
of
the
tree
he
vaulted
rather
than
climbed
aboard
ken
forgot
that
pepe
could
understand
little
english
and
he
yelled
grab
an
oar
pepe
keep
the
jaguar
in
the
water
don
t
let
him
in
the
boat
but
pepe
even
if
he
had
understood
had
a
better
idea
nimble
he
ran
over
the
boat
and
grasped
the
branches
of
the
tree
just
as
the
jaguar
flopped
paws
and
head
over
the
stern
gunwale
ken
had
only
a
fleeting
instant
to
get
a
bead
on
that
yellow
body
and
before
he
could
be
sure
of
an
aim
the
branch
weighted
with
pepe
sank
down
to
hide
both
boat
and
jaguar
the
chill
of
fear
for
pepe
changed
to
hot
rage
at
this
new
difficulty
then
george
began
to
shoot
ken
heard
the
bullet
hit
the
boat
george
wait
shouted
ken
don
t
shoot
holes
in
the
boat
you
ll
sink
it
that
was
as
much
as
george
cared
about
such
a
possibility
he
stood
on
the
bank
and
worked
the
lever
of
his
with
wild
haste
ken
plainly
heard
the
spat
of
the
bullets
and
the
sound
was
that
of
lead
in
contact
with
wood
so
he
knew
george
was
not
hitting
the
jaguar
you
ll
ruin
the
boat
roared
ken
pepe
had
worked
up
from
the
lower
end
of
the
branch
and
as
soon
as
he
straddled
it
and
hunched
himself
nearer
shore
the
foliage
rose
out
of
the
water
exposing
the
boat
george
kept
on
shooting
till
his
magazine
was
empty
ken
s
position
was
too
low
for
him
to
see
the
jaguar
then
the
boat
swung
loose
from
the
branch
and
drifting
down
gradually
approached
the
shore
pull
yourself
together
george
called
ken
keep
cool
make
sure
of
your
aim
we
ve
got
him
now
he
s
mine
he
s
mine
he
s
mine
don
t
you
dare
shoot
howled
george
i
got
him
all
right
but
steady
up
can
t
you
hit
him
once
anyway
apparently
without
aim
george
fired
then
jerking
the
lever
he
fired
again
the
boat
drifted
into
overhanging
vines
once
more
ken
saw
a
yellow
and
black
object
then
a
trembling
trail
of
leaves
he
s
coming
out
below
you
look
out
yelled
ken
george
disappeared
ken
saw
no
sign
of
the
jaguar
and
heard
no
shot
or
shout
from
george
pepe
dropped
from
his
branch
to
the
bank
and
caught
the
boat
ken
called
and
while
pepe
rowed
over
to
the
island
he
got
into
some
clothes
fit
to
hunt
in
then
they
hurried
back
across
the
channel
to
the
bank
ken
found
the
trail
of
the
jaguar
followed
it
up
to
the
edge
of
the
brush
and
lost
it
in
the
weedy
flat
george
came
out
of
a
patch
of
bamboos
he
looked
white
and
shaky
and
wild
with
disappointment
oh
i
had
a
dandy
shot
as
he
came
out
but
the
blamed
gun
jammed
again
come
on
we
ll
get
him
he
s
all
shot
up
i
bet
i
hit
him
ten
times
he
won
t
get
away
ken
finally
got
george
back
to
camp
the
boat
was
half
full
of
water
making
it
necessary
to
pull
it
out
on
the
bank
and
turn
it
over
there
were
ten
in
it
george
you
hit
the
boat
anyway
ken
said
now
we
ve
a
job
on
our
hands
hal
came
puffing
into
camp
he
was
red
of
face
and
the
sweat
stood
out
on
his
forehead
he
had
a
small
animal
of
some
kind
in
a
sack
and
his
legs
were
wet
to
his
knees
what
was
all
the
pegging
about
he
asked
breathlessly
i
expected
to
find
camp
surrounded
by
indians
kid
it
s
been
pretty
hot
round
here
for
a
little
george
and
pepe
rounded
up
a
tiger
tell
us
about
it
george
said
ken
so
while
ken
began
to
whittle
pegs
to
pound
into
the
george
wiped
his
flushed
sweaty
face
and
talked
we
were
up
there
a
piece
round
the
bend
i
saw
a
black
squirrel
and
went
ashore
to
get
him
but
i
couldn
t
find
him
and
in
kicking
round
in
the
brush
i
came
into
a
kind
of
trail
or
runway
then
i
ran
plumb
into
that
darned
jaguar
i
was
so
scared
i
couldn
t
remember
my
gun
but
the
cat
turned
and
ran
it
was
lucky
he
didn
t
make
at
me
when
i
saw
him
run
i
got
back
my
courage
i
called
for
pepe
to
row
and
keep
a
lookout
then
i
got
into
the
flat
i
must
have
come
down
a
good
ways
before
i
saw
him
i
shot
and
he
dodged
back
into
the
brush
again
i
fired
into
the
moving
bushes
where
he
was
and
pretty
soon
i
ventured
to
get
in
on
the
bank
where
i
had
a
better
chance
i
guess
it
was
about
that
time
that
i
heard
you
yell
then
it
all
happened
you
hit
him
didn
t
you
hear
him
scream
what
a
jump
he
made
if
it
hadn
t
been
so
terrible
when
your
hammerless
kicked
pepe
overboard
i
would
have
died
laughing
then
i
was
paralyzed
when
the
jaguar
swam
for
the
boat
he
was
hurt
for
the
water
was
bloody
things
came
off
quick
i
tell
you
like
a
monkey
pepe
scrambled
into
the
tree
when
i
got
my
gun
loaded
the
jaguar
was
crouched
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
watching
pepe
then
i
began
to
shoot
i
can
t
realize
he
got
away
from
us
what
was
the
reason
you
didn
t
knock
him
well
you
see
george
there
were
two
good
reasons
ken
replied
the
first
was
that
at
that
time
i
was
busy
dodging
bullets
from
your
rifle
and
the
second
was
that
you
threatened
my
life
if
i
killed
your
jaguar
did
i
get
as
nutty
as
that
but
it
was
pretty
warm
there
for
a
little
say
was
he
a
big
one
my
eyes
were
so
hazy
i
didn
t
see
him
clear
he
wasn
t
big
not
half
as
big
as
the
one
i
lost
yesterday
yours
was
a
long
wiry
beast
like
a
panther
and
pepe
sat
on
the
bank
and
while
he
nursed
his
bruises
he
smoked
once
he
made
a
speech
that
was
untranslatable
but
hal
gave
it
an
interpretation
which
was
probably
near
correct
that
s
right
pepe
pretty
punk
mucho
punk
a
i
ll
tell
you
what
fellows
said
hal
i
know
where
we
get
a
tiger
we
ll
get
one
in
the
neck
if
we
don
t
watch
out
replied
george
ken
thought
that
hal
looked
very
frank
and
earnest
and
honest
and
eager
but
there
was
never
any
telling
about
him
where
he
asked
skeptically
down
along
the
river
you
know
i
ve
been
setting
traps
all
along
there
s
a
flat
for
a
good
piece
down
i
came
to
a
little
gully
full
of
big
tracks
big
as
my
two
hands
and
fresh
honest
injun
kid
queried
ken
hope
to
die
if
i
m
lyin
replied
hal
i
want
to
see
somebody
kill
a
tiger
now
let
s
go
down
there
in
the
boat
and
wait
for
one
to
come
to
drink
there
s
a
big
log
with
driftwood
lodged
on
it
we
can
hide
behind
that
great
idea
hal
said
ken
we
d
be
pretty
safe
in
the
boat
i
want
to
say
that
tigers
have
sort
of
got
on
my
nerves
i
ought
to
go
over
in
the
jungle
to
look
for
the
one
i
crippled
he
s
dead
by
now
but
the
longer
i
put
it
off
the
harder
it
is
to
go
i
ll
back
out
yet
come
we
ll
have
an
early
dinner
then
to
watch
for
hal
s
tiger
the
sun
had
just
set
and
the
hot
breeze
began
to
swirl
up
the
river
when
ken
slid
the
boat
into
the
water
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
it
did
not
leak
we
ll
take
only
two
guns
said
ken
my
and
the
hammerless
with
some
we
want
to
be
quiet
and
if
you
fellows
take
your
guns
you
ll
be
pegging
at
ducks
and
things
that
won
t
do
pepe
sat
at
the
oars
with
instructions
to
row
easily
george
and
hal
occupied
the
and
ken
took
his
place
in
the
bow
with
both
guns
at
hand
the
hot
wind
roared
in
the
cypresses
and
the
river
whipped
up
little
waves
with
white
crests
long
streamers
of
gray
moss
waved
out
over
the
water
and
branches
tossed
and
swayed
the
blow
did
not
last
for
many
minutes
trees
and
river
once
more
grew
quiet
and
suddenly
the
heat
was
gone
as
pepe
rowed
on
down
the
river
cypress
island
began
to
disappear
round
a
bend
and
presently
was
out
of
sight
ducks
were
already
in
flight
they
flew
low
over
the
boat
so
low
that
ken
could
almost
have
reached
them
with
the
barrel
of
his
gun
the
river
here
widened
it
was
full
of
huge
snags
a
high
wooded
bluff
shadowed
the
western
shore
on
the
left
towering
cypresses
all
laced
together
in
dense
vine
and
moss
webs
leaned
out
under
hal
s
direction
pepe
rowed
to
a
pile
of
driftwood
and
here
the
boat
was
moored
the
gully
mentioned
by
hal
was
some
sixty
yards
distant
it
opened
like
the
mouth
of
a
cave
beyond
the
cypresses
thick
intertwining
bamboos
covered
it
i
wish
we
d
gone
in
to
see
the
tracks
said
ken
but
i
ll
take
your
word
hal
oh
they
re
there
all
right
i
don
t
doubt
it
looks
great
to
me
that
s
a
runway
hal
now
boys
get
a
comfortable
seat
and
settle
down
to
wait
don
t
talk
just
listen
and
watch
remember
soon
we
ll
be
out
of
the
jungle
back
home
so
make
hay
while
the
sun
shines
watch
and
listen
whoever
sees
or
hears
anything
first
is
the
best
man
for
once
the
boys
were
as
obedient
as
lambs
but
then
ken
thought
the
surroundings
were
so
beautiful
and
wild
and
silent
that
any
boys
would
have
been
watchful
there
was
absolutely
no
sound
but
the
intermittent
whir
of
wings
the
flew
by
in
companies
ducks
cranes
herons
snipe
and
the
great
muscovies
ken
never
would
have
tired
of
that
procession
it
passed
all
too
soon
and
then
only
an
occasional
swept
swiftly
by
as
if
belated
slowly
the
wide
shaded
but
it
was
still
daylight
and
the
bank
and
the
runway
were
clearly
distinguishable
there
was
a
moment
ken
could
not
tell
just
how
he
knew
when
the
jungle
awakened
it
was
not
only
the
faint
hum
of
insects
it
was
a
sense
as
if
life
stirred
with
the
coming
of
twilight
pepe
was
the
first
to
earn
honors
at
the
listening
game
he
held
up
a
warning
forefinger
then
he
pointed
under
the
bluff
ken
saw
a
doe
stepping
out
of
a
fringe
of
willows
don
t
move
don
t
make
a
noise
whispered
ken
the
doe
shot
up
long
ears
and
watched
the
boat
then
a
little
fawn
trotted
out
and
splashed
in
the
water
both
deer
drank
then
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
leave
the
river
next
moment
hal
heard
something
downstream
and
george
saw
something
pepe
again
whispered
as
for
ken
he
saw
little
dark
shapes
moving
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
runway
he
heard
a
faint
trampling
of
hard
little
hoofs
but
if
these
animals
were
of
which
he
was
sure
they
did
not
come
out
into
the
open
runway
ken
tried
to
catch
pepe
s
attention
without
making
a
noise
however
pepe
was
absorbed
in
his
side
of
the
river
ken
then
forgot
he
had
companions
all
along
the
shores
were
faint
splashings
and
rustlings
and
crackings
a
loud
trampling
roar
rose
in
the
runway
and
seemed
to
move
backward
toward
the
jungle
diminishing
in
violence
pigs
running
something
scared
em
said
george
whispered
ken
all
the
sounds
ceased
the
jungle
seemed
to
sleep
in
deep
silence
ken
s
eyes
were
glued
to
the
light
patch
of
where
it
merged
in
the
dark
of
the
runway
then
ken
heard
a
sound
what
he
could
not
have
told
but
it
made
his
heart
beat
fast
there
came
a
few
pattering
thuds
soft
as
velvet
and
a
shadow
paler
than
the
dark
background
moved
out
of
the
runway
with
that
a
huge
jaguar
loped
into
the
open
he
did
not
look
around
he
took
a
long
easy
bound
down
to
the
water
and
began
to
lap
either
pepe
or
george
jerked
so
violently
as
to
make
the
boat
lurch
they
seemed
to
be
stifling
oh
ken
don
t
miss
whispered
hal
ken
had
the
automatic
over
the
log
and
in
line
his
teeth
were
shut
tight
and
he
was
cold
and
steady
he
meant
not
to
hurry
the
jaguar
was
a
heavy
squat
muscular
figure
not
graceful
and
beautiful
like
the
one
ken
had
crippled
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
about
he
had
caught
a
scent
it
was
then
that
ken
lowered
the
rifle
till
the
sight
covered
the
beast
lower
yet
to
his
huge
paws
then
still
lower
to
the
edge
of
the
water
ken
meant
to
shoot
low
enough
this
time
holding
the
rifle
there
and
holding
it
with
all
his
strength
he
pressed
the
trigger
once
twice
the
two
shots
rang
out
almost
simultaneously
ken
expected
to
see
this
jaguar
leap
but
the
beast
crumpled
up
and
sank
in
his
tracks
then
the
boys
yelled
and
ken
echoed
them
pepe
was
wildly
excited
and
began
to
fumble
with
the
oars
wait
wait
i
tell
you
ordered
ken
oh
ken
you
pegged
him
cried
hal
he
doesn
t
move
let
s
go
ashore
what
did
i
tell
you
it
took
me
to
find
the
tiger
ken
watched
with
sharp
eyes
and
held
his
rifle
ready
but
the
huddled
form
on
the
sand
never
so
much
as
twitched
i
guess
i
plugged
him
said
ken
with
unconscious
pride
pepe
rowed
the
boat
ashore
and
when
near
the
he
reached
out
with
an
oar
to
touch
the
jaguar
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
being
dead
the
boys
leaped
ashore
and
straightened
out
the
beast
he
was
huge
dirty
spotted
bloody
and
fiercely
savage
even
in
death
ken
s
bullets
had
torn
through
the
chest
making
fearful
wounds
pepe
jabbered
and
the
boys
all
talked
at
once
when
it
came
to
lifting
the
jaguar
into
the
boat
they
had
no
slight
task
the
short
body
was
very
heavy
but
at
last
they
loaded
it
in
the
bow
and
pepe
rowed
back
to
the
island
it
was
still
a
harder
task
to
get
the
jaguar
up
the
high
bank
pepe
kindled
a
fire
so
they
would
have
plenty
of
light
and
then
they
set
to
work
at
the
skinning
what
with
enthusiasm
over
the
stalk
and
talk
of
the
success
of
the
trip
and
compliments
to
ken
s
shooting
and
care
of
the
skinning
the
boys
were
three
hours
at
the
job
ken
remembering
hiram
bent
s
teachings
skinned
out
the
great
claws
himself
they
salted
the
pelt
and
nailed
it
up
on
the
big
cypress
you
d
never
have
got
one
but
for
me
said
hal
that
s
how
i
pay
you
for
the
tricks
you
ve
played
me
by
george
hal
it
s
a
noble
revenge
cried
ken
who
in
the
warmth
and
glow
of
happiness
of
the
time
quite
believed
his
brother
pepe
went
to
bed
first
george
turned
in
next
ken
took
a
last
look
at
the
great
pelt
stretched
on
the
cypress
and
then
he
sought
his
blankets
hal
however
remained
up
ken
heard
him
pounding
stakes
in
the
ground
hal
what
re
you
doing
i
m
settin
my
replied
hal
cheerfully
well
come
to
bed
keep
your
shirt
on
ken
old
boy
i
ll
be
along
presently
ken
fell
asleep
he
did
not
have
peaceful
slumbers
he
had
been
too
excited
to
rest
well
he
would
wake
up
out
of
a
nightmare
then
go
to
sleep
again
he
seemed
to
wake
suddenly
out
of
one
of
these
black
spells
and
he
was
conscious
of
pain
something
tugged
at
his
leg
what
the
dickens
he
said
and
raised
on
his
elbow
hal
was
asleep
between
george
and
pepe
who
were
snoring
just
then
ken
felt
a
violent
jerk
the
blankets
flew
up
at
his
feet
and
his
left
leg
went
out
across
his
brother
s
body
there
was
a
string
a
rope
something
fast
round
his
ankle
and
it
was
pulling
hard
it
hurt
jiminy
shouted
ken
reaching
for
his
foot
but
before
he
could
reach
it
another
tug
more
violent
pulled
his
leg
straight
out
ken
began
to
slide
what
on
earth
yelled
ken
say
something
s
got
me
the
yells
and
ken
s
rude
exertions
aroused
the
boys
and
they
were
frightened
ken
got
an
arm
around
hal
and
the
other
around
george
and
held
on
for
dear
life
he
was
more
frightened
than
they
pepe
leaped
up
jabbering
and
tripping
he
fell
all
in
a
heap
oh
my
leg
howled
ken
it
s
being
pulled
off
say
i
can
t
be
dreaming
most
assuredly
ken
was
wide
awake
the
moonlight
showed
his
bare
leg
sticking
out
and
round
his
ankle
a
heavy
it
was
stretched
tight
it
ran
down
over
the
bank
and
out
there
in
the
river
a
tremendous
fish
or
a
crocodile
was
surging
about
making
the
water
roar
pepe
was
trying
to
loosen
the
line
or
break
it
george
who
was
always
stupid
when
first
aroused
probably
imagined
he
was
being
mauled
by
a
jaguar
for
he
loudly
bellowed
ken
had
a
on
hal
oh
bawled
ken
not
only
was
he
scared
out
of
a
year
s
growth
he
was
in
terrible
pain
then
his
cries
grew
unintelligible
he
was
being
dragged
out
of
the
tent
still
he
clung
desperately
to
the
howling
george
and
the
fighting
hal
all
at
once
something
snapped
the
tension
relaxed
ken
fell
back
upon
hal
git
off
me
will
you
shouted
hal
are
you
but
hal
s
voice
had
not
the
usual
note
when
he
was
angry
or
impatient
he
was
laughing
so
he
could
not
speak
naturally
said
ken
and
sat
up
i
guess
here
was
where
i
got
it
is
my
leg
broken
what
came
off
pepe
was
staggering
about
on
the
bank
going
through
strange
motions
he
had
the
line
in
his
hands
and
at
the
other
end
was
a
monster
of
some
land
threshing
about
in
the
water
it
was
moonlight
and
ken
could
see
plainly
around
the
ankle
that
felt
broken
was
a
twisted
loop
of
hal
had
baited
a
hook
and
slipped
the
end
of
the
over
ken
s
foot
during
the
night
the
crocodile
or
an
enormous
fish
had
taken
the
bait
then
ken
had
nearly
been
hauled
off
the
island
pepe
was
doing
battle
with
the
hooked
thing
whatever
it
was
and
ken
was
about
to
go
to
his
assistance
when
again
the
line
broke
great
hal
you
have
a
nice
disposition
exclaimed
ken
you
have
a
wonderful
affection
for
your
brother
you
care
a
lot
about
his
legs
or
his
life
idiot
can
t
you
play
a
safe
trick
if
i
hadn
t
grabbed
you
and
george
i
d
been
pulled
into
the
river
eaten
up
maybe
and
my
ankle
is
sprained
it
won
t
be
any
good
for
a
week
you
are
a
bright
boy
and
in
spite
of
his
laughter
hal
began
to
look
ashamed
with
the
rest
of
that
night
ken
had
more
dreams
and
they
were
not
pleasant
he
awoke
from
one
in
a
cold
fright
it
must
have
been
late
for
the
moon
was
low
his
ankle
pained
and
throbbed
and
to
that
he
attributed
his
nightmare
he
was
falling
asleep
again
when
the
clink
of
tin
pans
made
him
sit
up
with
a
start
some
animal
was
prowling
about
camp
he
peered
into
the
moonlit
shadows
but
could
make
out
no
unfamiliar
object
still
he
was
not
satisfied
so
he
awoke
pepe
certainly
it
was
not
ken
s
intention
to
let
pepe
get
out
ahead
nevertheless
he
was
lame
and
slow
and
before
he
started
pepe
rolled
out
of
the
tent
santa
maria
shrieked
pepe
ken
fumbled
under
his
pillow
for
a
gun
hal
raised
up
so
quickly
that
he
bumped
ken
s
head
making
him
see
a
million
stars
george
rolled
over
nearly
knocking
down
the
tent
from
outside
came
a
sliddery
rustling
noise
then
another
yell
that
was
deadened
by
a
sounding
splash
ken
leaped
out
with
his
gun
george
at
his
elbow
pepe
stood
just
back
of
the
tent
his
arms
upraised
and
he
appeared
stunned
the
water
near
the
bank
was
boiling
and
bubbling
waves
were
dashing
on
the
shore
and
ripples
spreading
in
a
circle
george
shouted
in
spanish
crocodile
cried
ken
si
si
señor
replied
pepe
then
he
said
that
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
tent
the
crocodile
was
right
in
camp
not
ten
feet
from
where
the
boys
lay
pepe
also
said
that
these
brutes
were
and
that
he
had
better
watch
for
the
rest
of
the
night
ken
thought
him
like
all
the
natives
inclined
to
exaggerate
however
he
made
no
objection
to
pepe
s
holding
watch
over
the
crocodile
what
d
i
tell
you
growled
george
why
didn
t
you
let
me
shoot
him
let
s
go
back
to
bed
in
the
morning
when
ken
got
up
he
viewed
his
body
with
great
curiosity
the
ticks
and
the
cigarette
burns
had
left
him
a
beautifully
tattoed
specimen
of
aborigine
his
body
especially
his
arms
bore
hundreds
of
little
reddish
scars
bites
and
burns
together
there
was
not
however
any
itching
or
irritation
for
which
he
made
sure
he
had
to
thank
pepe
s
skill
and
the
george
did
not
get
up
when
ken
called
him
thinking
his
sleep
might
have
been
broken
ken
let
him
alone
a
while
longer
but
when
breakfast
was
smoking
he
gave
him
a
prod
george
rolled
over
looking
haggard
and
glum
i
m
sick
he
said
ken
s
cheerfulness
left
him
for
he
knew
what
sickness
or
injury
did
to
a
camping
trip
george
complained
of
aching
bones
headache
and
cramps
and
showed
a
tongue
with
a
yellow
coating
ken
said
he
had
eaten
too
much
fresh
meat
but
pepe
after
looking
george
over
called
it
a
name
that
sounded
like
what
s
that
ken
inquired
tropic
fever
replied
george
i
ve
had
it
before
for
a
while
he
was
a
very
sick
boy
ken
had
a
little
and
from
it
he
administered
what
he
thought
was
best
and
george
grew
easier
presently
then
ken
sat
down
to
deliberate
on
the
situation
whatever
way
he
viewed
it
he
always
came
back
to
the
same
thing
they
must
get
out
of
the
jungle
and
as
they
could
not
go
back
they
must
go
on
down
the
river
that
was
a
bad
enough
proposition
without
being
hampered
by
a
sick
boy
it
was
then
ken
had
a
subtle
change
of
feeling
a
shade
of
gloom
seemed
to
pervade
his
spirit
by
nine
o
clock
they
were
packed
and
turning
into
the
shady
channel
soon
were
out
in
the
sunlight
saying
to
cypress
island
at
the
moment
ken
did
not
feel
sorry
to
go
yet
he
knew
that
feeling
would
come
by
and
by
and
that
cypress
island
would
take
its
place
in
his
memory
as
one
more
haunting
calling
wild
place
they
turned
a
curve
to
run
under
a
rocky
bluff
from
which
came
a
muffled
roar
of
rapids
a
long
projecting
point
of
rock
extended
across
the
river
allowing
the
water
to
rush
through
only
at
a
narrow
channel
close
to
the
shore
it
was
an
obstacle
to
get
around
there
was
no
possibility
of
lifting
the
boat
over
the
bridge
of
rock
and
the
alternative
was
shooting
the
channel
ken
got
out
upon
the
rocks
only
to
find
that
drifting
the
boat
round
the
sharp
point
was
out
of
the
question
owing
to
a
dangerously
swift
current
ken
tried
the
depth
of
the
water
about
four
feet
then
he
dragged
the
boat
back
a
little
distance
and
stepped
into
the
river
look
look
cried
pepe
pointing
to
the
bank
about
ten
yards
away
was
a
bare
shelf
of
mud
glistening
with
water
and
showing
the
deep
tracks
of
a
crocodile
it
was
a
slide
and
manifestly
had
just
been
vacated
the
resembled
the
imprints
of
a
giant
s
hand
come
out
yelled
george
and
pepe
jabbered
to
his
saints
we
ve
got
to
go
down
this
river
ken
replied
and
he
kept
on
wading
till
he
got
the
boat
in
the
current
he
was
frightened
of
course
but
he
kept
on
despite
that
the
boat
lurched
into
the
channel
stern
first
and
he
leaped
up
on
the
bow
it
shot
down
with
the
speed
of
a
toboggan
and
the
boat
whirled
before
he
could
scramble
to
the
oars
what
was
worse
an
overhanging
tree
with
dead
snags
left
scarce
room
to
pass
beneath
ken
ducked
to
prevent
being
swept
overboard
and
one
of
the
snags
that
brushed
and
scraped
him
ran
under
his
belt
and
lifted
him
into
the
air
he
grasped
at
the
first
thing
he
could
lay
hands
on
which
happened
to
be
a
box
but
he
could
not
hold
to
it
because
the
boat
threatened
to
go
on
leaving
him
kicking
in
midair
and
holding
up
a
box
of
potatoes
ken
clutched
a
gunwale
only
to
see
the
water
swell
dangerously
over
the
edge
in
angry
helplessness
he
loosened
his
hold
then
the
snag
broke
just
in
the
nick
of
time
for
in
a
second
more
the
boat
would
have
been
swept
away
ken
fell
across
the
bow
held
on
and
soon
drifted
from
under
the
threshing
branches
and
seized
the
oars
pepe
and
george
and
hal
walked
round
the
ledge
and
even
when
they
reached
ken
had
not
stopped
laughing
boys
it
wasn
t
funny
declared
ken
soberly
i
said
it
was
coming
to
us
replied
george
there
were
rapids
below
and
ken
went
at
them
with
stern
eyes
and
set
lips
it
was
the
look
of
men
who
face
obstacles
in
getting
out
of
the
wilderness
more
than
one
high
wave
circled
spitefully
round
pepe
s
broad
shoulders
they
came
to
a
fall
where
the
river
dropped
a
few
feet
straight
down
ken
sent
the
boys
below
hal
and
george
made
a
detour
but
pepe
jumped
off
the
ledge
into
shallow
water
yelled
pepe
ken
was
becoming
accustomed
to
pepe
s
wild
yell
but
there
was
a
note
in
this
which
sent
a
shiver
over
him
before
looking
ken
snatched
his
rifle
from
the
boat
pepe
appeared
to
be
sailing
out
into
the
pool
but
his
feet
were
not
moving
ken
had
only
an
instant
but
in
that
he
saw
under
pepe
a
long
yellow
swimming
shape
leaving
a
wake
in
the
water
pepe
had
jumped
upon
the
back
of
a
crocodile
he
seemed
paralyzed
or
else
he
was
wisely
trusting
himself
there
rather
than
in
the
water
ken
was
too
shocked
to
offer
advice
indeed
he
would
not
have
known
how
to
meet
this
situation
suddenly
pepe
leaped
for
a
dry
stone
and
the
energy
of
his
leap
carried
him
into
the
river
beyond
like
a
flash
he
was
out
again
spouting
water
ken
turned
loose
the
automatic
on
the
crocodile
and
shot
a
magazine
of
shells
the
crocodile
made
a
tremendous
surge
churning
up
a
slimy
foam
then
vanished
in
a
pool
guess
this
ll
be
crocodile
day
said
ken
changing
the
clip
in
his
rifle
i
ll
bet
i
made
a
hole
in
that
one
boys
look
out
below
ken
shoved
the
boat
over
the
ledge
in
line
with
pepe
and
it
floated
to
him
while
ken
picked
his
way
round
the
rocky
shore
the
boys
piled
aboard
again
the
day
began
to
get
hot
ken
cautioned
the
boys
to
avoid
wading
if
possible
and
to
be
extremely
careful
where
they
stepped
pepe
pointed
now
and
then
to
huge
bubbles
breaking
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
said
they
were
made
by
crocodiles
from
then
on
ken
s
hands
were
full
he
struck
swift
water
where
rapid
after
rapid
fall
on
fall
took
the
boat
downhill
at
a
rate
to
afford
him
satisfaction
the
current
had
a
five
or
six
mile
speed
and
as
ken
had
no
portages
to
make
and
the
corrugated
rapids
of
big
waves
gave
him
speed
he
made
by
far
the
best
time
of
the
voyage
the
hot
hours
passed
cool
for
the
boys
because
they
were
always
wet
the
sun
sank
behind
a
hill
the
wind
ceased
to
whip
the
streamers
of
moss
at
last
in
a
gathering
twilight
ken
halted
at
a
wide
flat
rock
to
make
camp
forty
miles
if
we
made
an
inch
exclaimed
ken
the
boys
said
more
they
built
a
fire
cooked
supper
and
then
weary
and
silent
hal
and
george
and
pepe
rolled
into
their
blankets
but
ken
doggedly
worked
an
hour
at
his
map
and
notes
that
hard
forty
miles
meant
a
long
way
toward
the
success
of
his
trip
next
morning
the
mists
had
not
lifted
from
the
river
when
they
shoved
off
determined
to
beat
the
record
of
yesterday
difficulties
beset
them
from
the
start
the
highest
waterfall
of
the
trip
a
leak
in
the
boat
deep
short
rapids
narrows
with
choppy
waves
and
a
whirlpool
where
they
turned
round
and
round
unable
to
row
out
nor
did
they
get
free
till
pepe
lassoed
a
snag
and
pulled
them
out
about
noon
they
came
to
another
narrow
chute
brawling
down
into
a
deep
foamy
pool
again
ken
sent
the
boys
around
and
he
backed
the
boat
into
the
chute
and
just
as
the
current
caught
it
he
leaped
aboard
he
was
either
tired
or
careless
for
he
drifted
too
close
to
a
rock
and
try
as
he
might
at
the
last
moment
he
could
not
avoid
a
collision
as
the
stern
went
hard
on
the
rock
ken
expected
to
break
something
but
was
surprised
at
the
soft
thud
with
which
he
struck
it
flashed
into
his
mind
that
the
rock
was
quick
as
the
thought
there
came
a
rumble
under
the
boat
the
stern
heaved
up
there
was
a
great
splash
and
then
a
blow
that
splintered
the
gunwale
then
the
boat
shunted
off
affording
the
astounded
ken
a
good
view
of
a
very
angry
crocodile
he
had
been
sleeping
on
the
rock
the
boys
were
yelling
and
crowding
down
to
the
shore
where
ken
was
drifting
in
pepe
waded
in
to
catch
the
boat
what
was
it
hit
you
ken
asked
hal
mucho
malo
cried
pepe
the
boat
s
half
full
of
water
the
gunwale
s
all
split
ejaculated
george
only
an
accident
of
river
travel
replied
ken
with
mock
nonchalance
say
garrapato
about
is
it
coming
to
me
well
if
he
didn
t
get
slammed
by
a
crocodile
continued
george
they
unloaded
turned
out
the
water
broke
up
a
box
to
use
for
repairs
and
mended
the
damaged
gunwale
work
that
lost
more
than
a
good
hour
once
again
under
way
ken
made
some
interesting
observations
the
river
ceased
to
stand
on
end
in
places
crocodiles
slipped
off
every
muddy
promontory
and
wide
trails
ridged
the
steep
pepe
says
said
george
wild
cattle
roam
all
through
the
jungle
along
the
panuco
it
was
a
fact
that
the
rancheros
of
tamaulipas
state
had
no
idea
how
many
cattle
they
owned
ken
was
so
eager
to
see
if
pepe
had
been
correct
that
he
went
ashore
to
find
the
trails
were
indeed
those
of
cattle
then
pepe
we
must
be
somewhere
near
the
panuco
river
he
said
quien
sabe
rejoined
he
quietly
when
they
rounded
the
curve
they
came
upon
a
herd
of
cattle
that
clattered
up
the
bank
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
wilder
than
deer
ken
exclaimed
from
that
point
conditions
along
the
river
changed
the
banks
were
no
longer
green
the
beautiful
cypresses
gave
place
to
other
trees
as
huge
as
but
more
rugged
and
of
gaunt
outline
the
flowers
and
vines
and
shady
nooks
disappeared
everywhere
steers
and
cows
plunged
up
the
banks
everywhere
buzzards
rose
from
gruesome
feasts
the
shore
was
lined
with
dead
cattle
and
the
stench
of
putrefying
flesh
was
almost
unbearable
they
passed
cattle
mired
in
the
mud
being
slowly
tortured
to
death
by
flies
and
hunger
they
passed
cattle
that
had
slipped
off
steep
banks
and
could
not
get
back
and
were
bellowing
dismally
and
also
strangely
acting
cattle
that
pepe
said
had
gone
crazy
from
ticks
in
their
ears
ken
would
have
put
these
miserable
beasts
out
of
their
misery
had
not
george
restrained
him
with
a
few
words
about
mexican
law
a
sense
of
sickness
came
to
ken
and
though
he
drove
the
feeling
from
him
it
continually
returned
george
and
hal
lay
flat
on
the
canvas
shaded
with
a
couple
of
palm
leaves
pepe
rowed
on
and
on
growing
more
and
more
serious
and
quiet
his
quick
responsive
smile
was
wanting
now
by
way
of
diversion
and
also
in
the
hope
of
securing
a
specimen
ken
began
to
shoot
at
the
crocodiles
george
came
out
of
his
lethargy
and
took
up
his
rifle
he
would
have
had
to
be
ill
indeed
to
forswear
any
possible
shooting
and
now
that
ken
had
removed
the
bar
he
forgot
he
had
fever
every
hundred
yards
or
so
they
would
come
upon
a
crocodile
measuring
somewhere
from
about
six
feet
upward
and
occasionally
they
would
see
a
great
yellow
one
as
large
as
a
log
seldom
did
they
get
within
good
range
of
these
huge
fellows
and
shooting
from
a
moving
boat
was
not
easy
the
smaller
ones
however
allowed
the
boat
to
approach
quite
close
george
bounced
many
a
bullet
off
the
bank
but
he
never
hit
a
crocodile
ken
allowed
him
to
have
the
shots
for
the
fun
of
it
and
besides
he
was
watching
for
a
big
one
george
that
rifle
of
yours
is
leaded
it
doesn
t
shoot
where
you
aim
when
they
got
unusually
close
to
a
small
crocodile
george
verified
ken
s
statement
by
missing
his
game
some
yards
he
promptly
threw
the
rifle
overboard
an
act
that
caused
pepe
much
concern
whereupon
ken
proceeded
to
try
his
luck
instructing
pepe
to
row
about
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
kept
eye
on
one
shore
while
george
watched
the
other
he
shot
half
a
dozen
small
crocodiles
but
they
slipped
off
the
bank
before
pepe
could
get
ashore
this
did
not
appear
to
be
the
fault
of
the
rifle
for
some
of
the
reptiles
were
shot
almost
in
two
pieces
but
ken
had
yet
to
learn
more
about
the
tenacity
of
life
of
these
several
held
still
long
enough
for
ken
to
shoot
them
through
then
with
a
plunge
they
went
into
the
water
sinking
at
once
in
a
bloody
foam
he
knew
he
had
shot
them
through
for
he
saw
large
holes
in
the
lined
with
bits
of
bloody
skin
and
bone
there
s
one
said
george
pointing
let
s
get
closer
so
we
can
grab
him
he
s
got
a
good
piece
to
go
before
he
reaches
the
water
pepe
rowed
slowly
along
guiding
the
boat
a
little
nearer
the
shore
at
forty
feet
the
crocodile
raised
up
standing
on
short
legs
so
that
all
but
his
tail
was
free
of
the
ground
he
opened
his
huge
jaws
either
in
astonishment
or
to
intimidate
them
and
then
ken
shot
him
straight
down
the
throat
he
flopped
convulsively
and
started
to
slide
and
roll
when
he
reached
the
water
he
turned
over
on
his
back
with
his
feet
sticking
up
resembling
a
huge
frog
pepe
rowed
hard
to
the
shore
just
as
the
crocodile
with
one
last
convulsion
rolled
off
into
deeper
water
ken
reached
over
grasped
his
foot
and
was
drawing
it
up
when
a
sight
of
cold
glassy
eyes
and
jaws
made
him
let
go
then
the
crocodile
sank
in
water
where
pepe
could
not
touch
bottom
with
an
oar
let
s
get
one
if
it
takes
a
week
declared
george
the
lad
might
be
sick
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
spirit
look
there
he
exclaimed
oh
i
guess
it
s
a
log
too
big
they
had
been
unable
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
crocodile
and
a
log
of
driftwood
until
it
was
too
late
in
this
instance
a
long
object
lay
upon
a
low
bank
despite
its
immense
size
which
certainly
made
the
chances
in
favor
of
its
being
a
log
ken
determined
this
time
to
be
fooled
on
the
right
side
he
had
seen
a
dozen
logs
as
he
thought
suddenly
become
animated
and
slip
into
the
river
hold
steady
pepe
i
ll
take
a
crack
at
that
just
for
luck
the
distance
was
about
a
hundred
yards
a
fine
range
for
the
little
rifle
resting
on
his
knee
he
sighted
low
under
the
gray
object
and
pulled
the
trigger
twice
there
were
two
spats
so
close
together
as
to
be
barely
distinguishable
the
log
of
driftwood
leaped
into
life
whoop
shouted
hal
it
s
a
crocodile
yelled
george
you
hit
you
hit
will
you
listen
to
that
row
hard
pepe
pull
he
bent
to
the
oars
and
the
boat
flew
shoreward
the
huge
crocodile
opening
jaws
snapped
them
shut
with
loud
cracks
then
he
beat
the
bank
with
his
tail
it
was
as
limber
as
a
willow
but
he
seemed
unable
to
move
his
central
parts
his
thick
bulk
where
ken
had
sent
the
two
mushroom
bullets
the
sodden
blows
jarred
pieces
from
the
above
him
each
blow
was
powerful
enough
to
have
staved
in
the
planking
of
a
ship
all
at
once
he
lunged
upward
and
falling
over
backward
slid
down
his
runway
into
a
few
inches
of
water
where
he
stuck
go
in
above
him
pepe
ken
shouted
here
heavens
what
a
monster
deliberately
at
scarce
twenty
feet
ken
shot
the
remaining
four
shells
into
the
crocodile
the
bullets
tore
through
his
horny
hide
and
blood
and
muddy
water
spouted
up
george
and
pepe
and
hal
yelled
and
ken
kept
time
with
them
the
terrible
lashing
tail
swung
back
and
forth
almost
too
swiftly
for
the
eye
to
catch
a
deluge
of
mud
and
water
descended
upon
the
boys
bespattering
blinding
them
and
weighing
down
the
boat
they
jumped
out
upon
the
bank
to
escape
it
they
ran
to
and
fro
in
aimless
excitement
ken
still
clutched
the
rifle
but
he
had
no
shells
for
it
george
was
absurd
enough
to
fling
a
stone
into
the
cloud
of
muddy
froth
and
spray
that
hid
the
threshing
leviathan
presently
the
commotion
subsided
enough
for
them
to
see
the
great
crocodile
lying
half
on
his
back
with
belly
all
torn
and
bloody
and
huge
hands
pawing
the
air
he
was
edging
slipping
off
into
deeper
water
he
ll
get
away
he
ll
get
away
cried
hal
what
ll
we
do
ken
racked
his
brains
pepe
get
your
lasso
rope
him
rope
him
hurry
he
s
slipping
yelled
george
pepe
snatched
up
his
lariat
and
without
waiting
to
coil
it
cast
the
loop
he
caught
one
of
the
flippers
and
hauled
tight
on
it
just
as
the
crocodile
slipped
out
of
sight
off
the
muddy
ledge
the
others
ran
to
the
boat
and
grasping
hold
of
the
lasso
with
pepe
squared
away
and
began
to
pull
plain
it
was
that
the
crocodile
was
not
coming
up
so
easily
they
could
not
budge
him
hang
on
boys
ken
shouted
it
s
a
the
lasso
was
suddenly
jerked
out
with
a
kind
of
twang
crash
went
pepe
and
hal
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
ken
went
sprawling
into
the
mud
and
george
who
had
the
last
hold
went
to
his
knees
but
valiantly
clung
to
the
slipping
rope
bounding
up
ken
grasped
it
from
him
and
wound
it
round
the
sharp
nose
of
the
bowsprit
get
in
hustle
he
called
falling
aboard
you
re
always
saying
it
s
coming
to
us
here
s
where
george
had
hardly
got
into
the
boat
when
the
crocodile
pulled
it
off
shore
and
away
it
went
sailing
whoop
all
aboard
for
panuco
yelled
hal
now
pepe
you
don
t
need
to
row
any
more
we
ve
a
ken
added
but
pepe
did
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
he
kept
calling
on
the
saints
and
crying
mucho
malo
george
and
ken
and
hal
however
were
hilarious
they
had
not
yet
had
experience
enough
to
know
crocodiles
faster
and
faster
they
went
the
water
began
to
surge
away
from
the
bow
and
leave
a
gurgling
wake
behind
the
stern
soon
the
boat
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
where
the
water
was
deepest
and
the
lasso
went
almost
straight
down
ken
felt
the
stern
of
the
boat
gradually
lifted
and
then
in
alarm
he
saw
the
front
end
sinking
in
the
water
the
crocodile
was
hauling
the
bow
under
pepe
your
machete
cut
the
lasso
he
ordered
sharply
george
had
to
repeat
the
order
wildly
pepe
searched
under
the
seat
and
along
the
gunwales
he
could
not
find
the
cut
the
rope
ken
thundered
use
a
knife
the
ax
anything
only
cut
it
and
cut
it
quick
pepe
could
find
nothing
knife
in
hand
ken
leaped
over
his
head
sprawled
headlong
over
the
trunk
and
slashed
the
taut
lasso
just
as
the
water
began
to
roar
into
the
boat
the
bow
bobbed
up
as
a
cork
that
had
been
under
but
the
boat
had
shipped
six
inches
of
water
illustration
knife
in
hand
ken
leaped
over
his
head
and
slashed
the
taut
lasso
row
ashore
pepe
steady
there
trim
the
boat
george
they
beached
at
a
hard
and
rested
a
little
before
unloading
to
turn
out
the
water
grande
observed
pepe
yes
he
was
big
assented
george
i
wonder
what
s
going
to
happen
to
us
next
added
hal
ken
ward
looked
at
these
companions
of
his
and
he
laughed
outright
well
if
you
all
don
t
take
the
cake
for
nerve
by
wild
pepe
s
long
years
of
work
rowing
for
tarpon
fishermen
now
stood
the
boys
in
good
stead
all
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
he
bent
steadily
to
the
oars
occasionally
they
came
to
rifts
but
these
were
not
difficult
to
pass
being
mere
swift
shallow
channels
over
sandy
bottom
the
rocks
and
the
rapids
were
things
of
the
past
george
lay
in
a
kind
of
stupor
and
hal
lolled
in
his
seat
ken
however
kept
alert
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
began
to
be
annoyed
at
the
scarcity
of
the
muddy
margins
of
the
river
the
steep
banks
and
the
forests
offered
few
places
where
it
was
possible
to
rest
to
say
nothing
of
sleep
every
turn
in
the
widening
river
gave
ken
hope
which
resulted
in
disappointment
he
found
consolation
however
in
the
fact
that
every
turn
and
every
hour
put
him
so
much
farther
on
the
way
about
five
o
clock
ken
had
unexpected
good
luck
in
shape
of
a
small
cut
off
from
the
mainland
and
therefore
free
of
it
was
clean
and
dry
with
a
pile
of
driftwood
at
one
end
tumble
out
boys
called
ken
as
pepe
beached
the
boat
we
ll
pitch
camp
here
neither
hal
nor
george
showed
any
alacrity
ken
watched
his
brother
he
feared
to
see
some
of
the
symptoms
of
george
s
sickness
both
lads
however
seemed
cheerful
though
too
tired
to
be
of
much
use
in
the
pitching
of
camp
ken
could
not
recover
his
former
good
spirits
there
was
a
sense
of
foreboding
in
his
mind
that
all
was
not
well
that
he
must
hurry
hurry
and
although
george
appeared
to
be
holding
his
own
hal
healthy
enough
and
pepe
s
brooding
quiet
at
least
no
worse
ken
could
not
rid
himself
of
gloom
if
he
had
answered
the
question
that
knocked
at
his
mind
he
would
have
admitted
a
certainty
of
disaster
so
he
kept
active
and
when
there
were
no
more
tasks
for
that
day
he
worked
on
his
and
then
watched
the
flight
of
wild
fowl
the
farther
down
the
river
the
boys
traveled
the
more
numerous
were
the
herons
and
cranes
and
ducks
but
they
saw
no
more
of
the
beautiful
as
pepe
called
them
or
the
little
ducks
or
the
bitterns
on
the
other
hand
wild
geese
were
common
and
there
were
flocks
and
flocks
of
teal
and
canvasbacks
pepe
as
usual
cooked
duck
and
he
had
to
eat
it
george
had
lost
his
appetite
altogether
hal
had
lost
his
taste
for
meat
at
least
and
ken
made
a
frugal
meal
of
rice
boys
he
said
the
less
you
eat
from
now
on
the
better
for
you
it
took
resolution
to
drink
the
cocoa
for
ken
could
not
shut
out
remembrance
of
the
green
water
and
the
of
dead
and
decaying
cattle
still
he
was
parched
with
thirst
he
had
to
drink
that
night
he
slept
ten
hours
without
turning
over
next
morning
he
had
to
shake
pepe
to
rouse
him
ken
took
turns
at
the
oars
with
pepe
it
was
not
only
that
he
fancied
pepe
was
weakening
and
in
need
of
an
occasional
rest
but
the
fact
that
he
wanted
to
be
occupied
and
especially
to
keep
in
good
condition
they
made
thirty
miles
by
four
o
clock
and
most
of
it
against
a
breeze
not
in
the
whole
distance
did
they
pass
half
a
dozen
places
fit
for
a
camp
toward
evening
the
river
narrowed
again
resembling
somewhat
the
santa
rosa
of
earlier
acquaintance
the
magnificent
dark
forests
crowded
high
on
the
banks
always
screened
and
curtained
by
gray
moss
as
if
to
keep
their
secrets
the
sun
was
just
tipping
with
gold
the
mossy
crests
of
a
grove
of
giant
ceibas
when
the
boys
rounded
a
bend
to
come
upon
the
first
ledge
of
rocks
for
two
days
a
low
grassy
promontory
invited
the
eyes
searching
for
this
spot
appeared
ideal
it
certainly
was
beautiful
the
ledge
jutted
into
the
river
almost
to
the
opposite
shore
forcing
the
water
to
rush
through
a
rocky
trough
into
a
great
pool
below
they
could
not
pitch
the
tent
since
the
stony
ground
would
not
admit
stakes
so
they
laid
the
canvas
flat
pepe
went
up
the
bank
with
his
in
search
of
firewood
to
ken
s
utmost
delight
he
found
a
little
spring
of
sweet
water
trickling
from
the
ledge
and
by
digging
a
hole
was
enabled
to
get
a
drink
the
first
one
in
more
than
a
week
a
little
later
as
he
was
spreading
the
blankets
george
called
his
attention
to
shouts
up
in
the
woods
pepe
s
treed
something
ken
said
take
your
gun
and
hunt
him
up
ken
went
on
making
a
bed
and
busying
himself
about
camp
with
little
heed
to
george
s
departure
presently
however
he
was
startled
by
unmistakable
sounds
of
alarm
george
and
pepe
were
yelling
in
unison
and
from
the
sound
appeared
to
be
quite
a
distance
away
what
the
deuce
ken
ejaculated
snatching
up
his
rifle
he
snapped
a
clip
in
the
magazine
and
dropped
several
loaded
clips
and
a
box
of
extra
shells
into
his
coat
pocket
after
his
adventure
with
the
jaguar
he
decided
never
again
to
find
himself
short
of
ammunition
running
up
the
sloping
bank
he
entered
the
forest
shouting
for
his
companions
answering
cries
came
from
in
front
and
a
little
to
the
left
he
could
not
make
out
what
was
said
save
for
drooping
moss
the
forest
was
comparatively
open
and
at
a
hundred
paces
from
the
were
glades
covered
with
thickets
and
long
grass
and
short
the
ground
sloped
upward
quite
perceptibly
hey
boys
where
are
you
called
ken
pepe
s
shrill
yells
mingled
with
george
s
shouts
at
first
their
meaning
was
unintelligible
but
after
calling
twice
ken
understood
javelin
go
back
javelin
we
re
treed
wild
pigs
santa
maria
run
for
your
life
this
was
certainly
enlightening
and
rather
embarrassing
ken
remembered
the
other
time
the
boys
had
made
him
run
and
he
grew
hot
with
anger
i
ll
be
blessed
if
i
ll
run
he
said
in
the
pride
of
conceit
and
wounded
vanity
whereupon
he
began
to
climb
the
slope
stopping
every
few
steps
to
listen
and
look
ken
wondered
what
had
made
pepe
go
so
far
for
still
there
was
nothing
but
green
wood
all
about
walking
round
a
clump
of
seared
and
yellow
palms
that
rustled
in
the
breeze
ken
suddenly
espied
george
s
white
shirt
he
was
in
a
scrubby
sapling
not
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
then
ken
espied
pepe
perched
in
the
forks
of
a
ceiba
high
above
the
thickets
and
low
shrubbery
ken
was
scarcely
more
than
a
dozen
rods
from
them
down
the
gradual
slope
both
saw
him
at
once
run
you
indian
run
bawled
george
waving
his
hands
george
implored
ken
to
fly
to
save
his
precious
life
what
for
you
fools
i
don
t
see
anything
to
run
from
ken
shouted
back
his
temper
had
soured
a
little
during
the
last
few
days
you
d
better
run
or
you
ll
have
to
climb
replied
george
wild
pigs
a
thousand
of
em
where
right
under
us
there
oh
if
they
see
you
listen
to
this
he
broke
off
a
branch
trimmed
it
of
leaves
and
flung
it
down
ken
heard
a
low
trampling
roar
of
many
hard
little
feet
brushings
in
the
thicket
and
cracking
of
twigs
as
close
as
he
was
however
he
could
not
see
a
moving
object
the
dead
grass
and
brush
were
several
feet
high
up
to
his
waist
in
spots
and
though
he
changed
position
several
times
no
did
he
see
you
want
to
look
out
say
man
these
are
wild
pigs
boars
i
tell
you
they
ll
kill
you
bellowed
george
are
you
going
to
stay
up
there
all
night
ken
asked
sarcastically
we
ll
stay
till
they
go
away
all
right
i
ll
scare
them
away
ken
replied
and
suiting
action
to
word
he
worked
the
automatic
as
fast
as
it
would
shoot
aiming
into
the
thicket
under
george
of
all
the
foolish
things
a
nettled
hunter
ever
did
that
was
the
worst
a
roar
answered
the
echoes
of
the
rifle
and
the
roar
rose
from
every
side
of
the
trees
the
victims
were
in
nervously
ken
clamped
a
fresh
clip
of
shells
into
the
rifle
clouds
of
dust
arose
and
strange
little
squeals
and
grunts
seemed
to
come
from
every
quarter
then
the
grass
and
bushes
were
suddenly
torn
apart
by
swift
gray
forms
with
glittering
eyes
they
were
everywhere
shrieked
george
high
above
the
tumult
for
a
thrilling
instant
ken
stood
his
ground
and
fired
at
the
bobbing
gray
backs
but
every
break
made
in
the
ranks
by
the
powerful
shells
filled
in
a
flash
before
that
vicious
charge
he
wavered
then
ran
as
if
pursued
by
demons
the
way
was
downhill
ken
tripped
fell
rolled
over
and
over
then
still
clutching
the
rifle
rose
with
a
bound
and
fled
the
javelin
had
gained
they
were
at
his
heels
he
ran
like
a
deer
then
seeing
a
low
branch
he
leaped
for
it
grasped
it
with
one
hand
and
crooking
an
elbow
round
it
swung
with
the
old
giant
swing
before
ken
knew
how
it
had
happened
he
was
astride
a
dangerously
swaying
branch
directly
over
a
troop
of
little
peccaries
some
were
young
and
sleek
others
were
old
and
rough
some
had
little
yellow
teeth
or
tusks
and
all
pointed
their
sharp
noses
upward
as
if
expecting
him
to
fall
into
their
very
mouths
feeling
safe
once
more
ken
loaded
the
rifle
and
began
to
kill
the
biggest
most
vicious
when
he
had
killed
twelve
in
twelve
shots
he
saw
that
shooting
a
few
would
be
of
no
avail
there
were
hundreds
it
seemed
and
he
had
scarcely
fifty
shells
left
moreover
the
grew
so
hot
that
it
burnt
his
hands
hearing
george
s
yell
he
replied
somewhat
to
his
disgust
i
m
all
right
george
only
treed
how
re

pigs

they
chased

pepe

by
javelin
wild
pigs
i

got
to

that
was
hal

reply
ken
called
a
sharp
angry
order
for
hal
to
keep
away
but
hal
did
not
obey
ken
heard
him
coming
and
presently
saw
him
enter
one
of
the
little
glades
he
had
ken
s
shotgun
and
was
peering
cautiously
about
ken
where
are

of

a
troop
of
flashed
into

glade

them
and
raised
the
shotgun
he
shot
both
barrels
the
shot
tore
through
the
brush
all
around
ken
but
fortunately
beneath
him
neither
the
noise
nor
the
lead
stopped
the
pugnacious
little
peccaries
hal
dropped
ken
s
hammerless
and
fled
run
faster
yelled
george
who
evidently
enjoyed
hal
s
plight
they
ll
get
you
run
hard
the
lad
was
running
close
to
the
record
when
he
disappeared
in
trying
to
find
a
more
comfortable
posture
so
he
could
apply
himself
to
an
interesting
study
of
his
captors
ken
made
the
startling
discovery
that
the
branch
which
upheld
him
was
splitting
from
the
his
heart
began
to
pound
in
his
breast
then
it
went
up
into
his
throat
every
move
he
made
for
he
had
started
to
edge
toward

tree

the
little
white
split

a
goner
ken
s
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
gap
where
the
branch
was
slowly
separating
from
the
he
glanced
about
to
see
if
he
could
not
leap
to
another
branch
there
was
nothing
near
that
would
hold
him
in
desperation
he
resolved
to
drop
the
rifle
cautiously
get
to
his
feet
upon
the
branch
and
with
one
spring
try
to
reach
the
tree
when
about
to
act
upon
this
last
chance
he
heard
pepe
s
shrill
yell
and
a
crashing
in
the
brush
then
followed
the
unmistakable
roar
and
crackling
of
fire
pepe
had
fired
the
brush
no
he
was
making
his
way
toward
ken
armed
with
a
huge
torch
pepe
you
ll
fire
the
jungle
cried
ken
forgetting
what
was
at
stake
and
that
pepe
could
not
understand
much
english
but
ken
had
been
in
one
and
remembered
it
with
horror
the
stirred
uneasily
and
ran
around
under
ken
tumbling
over
one
another
when
pepe
burst
through
the
brush
holding
before
him
palm
leaves
flaring
in
hissing
flames
the
whole
pack
of
pigs
bowled
away
into
the
forest
at
breakneck
speed
ken
leaped
down
and
the
branch
came
with
him
george
came
running
up
his
face
white
his
eyes
big
behind
him
rose
a
roar
that
ken
thought
might
be
another
drove
of
pigs
till
he
saw
smoke
and
flame
boys
the
jungle
s
on
fire
run
for
the
river
in
their
hurry
they
miscalculated
the
location
of
camp
and
dashed
out
of
the
jungle
over
a
steep
bank
and
they
all
had
a
tumble
it
was
necessary
to
wade
to
reach
the
rocky
ledge
ken
shook
hands
with
pepe
george
tell
him
that
was
a
nervy
thing
to
do
he
saved
my
life
i
do
believe
you
fellows
did
a
lot
of
hollering
said
hal
from
his
perch
in
the
boat
say
young
man
you
ve
got
to
go
back
after
my
gun
why
didn
t
you
do
what
i
told
you
foolish
to
run
into
danger
that
way
declared
ken
severely
you
don
t
suppose
i
was
going
to
overlook
a
chance
to
see
ken
ward
treed
do
you
well
you
saw
him
and
that
was
no
joke
but
i
wish
pepe
could
have
scared
those
pigs
off
without
firing
the
jungle
pepe
says
it
ll
give
the
ticks
a
good
roasting
said
george
we
ll
have
roast
pig
anyway
added
ken
he
kept
watching
the
jungle
back
of
the
camp
as
if
he
expected
it
to
blow
up
like
a
but
this
tamaulipas
jungle
was
not
penetier
forest
a
cloud
of
smoke
rolled
up
there
was
a
frequent
roaring
of
dry
palms
but
the
green
growths
did
not
burn
it
was
not
much
of
a
and
ken
concluded
that
it
would
soon
burn
out
so
he
took
advantage
of
the
waning
daylight
to
spread
out
his
map
and
plot
in
the
day
s
travel
this
time
hal
watched
him
with
a
quiet
attention
that
was
both
flattering
and
stimulating
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
task
he
said
well
ken
we
re
having
sport
but
we
re
doing
something
more
something
worth
while
leaping
just
before
dark
when
the
boys
were
at
supper
a
swarm
of
black
mosquitoes
swooped
down
upon
camp
pepe
could
not
have
shown
more
fear
at
angry
snakes
and
he
began
to
pile
green
wood
and
leaves
on
the
fire
to
make
a
heavy
smoke
these
mosquitoes
were
very
large
with
wings
their
bite
was
as
painful
as
the
sting
of
a
bee
after
threshing
about
until
tired
out
the
boys
went
to
bed
but
it
was
only
to
get
up
again
for
the
mosquitoes
could
bite
through
two
thicknesses
of
blanket
for
a
wonder
every
one
was
quiet
even
george
did
not
grumble
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
sit
or
stand
in
the
smoke
of
the
campfire
the
boys
wore
their
gloves
and
wrapped
blankets
round
heads
and
shoulders
they
crouched
over
the
fire
until
tired
of
that
position
then
stood
up
till
they
could
stand
no
longer
it
was
a
wretched
sleepless
night
with
the
bloodthirsty
mosquitoes
humming
about
like
a
swarm
of
bees
they
did
not
go
away
until
dawn
that
s
what
i
get
for
losing
the
said
ken
wearily
breakfast
was
not
a
cheerful
meal
despite
the
fact
that
the
boys
all
tried
to
brace
up
george
s
condition
showed
ken
the
necessity
for
renewed
efforts
to
get
out
of
the
jungle
pepe
appeared
heavy
and
slow
and
what
was
more
alarming
he
had
lost
his
appetite
hal
was
cross
but
seemed
to
keep
well
it
was
hard
enough
for
ken
to
persuade
george
and
pepe
to
take
the
bitter
doses
of
quinine
and
hal
positively
refused
it
makes
me
sick
i
tell
you
said
hal
impatiently
but
hal
you
ought
to
be
guided
by
my
judgment
now
replied
ken
gently
i
don
t
care
i
ve
had
enough
of
bitter
pills
i
ask
you
as
a
favor
persisted
ken
quietly
no
well
then
i
ll
have
to
make
you
take
them
roared
hal
if
necessary
i
ll
throw
you
down
and
pry
open
your
mouth
and
get
pepe
to
stuff
these
pills
down
your
throat
there
went
on
ken
and
now
he
did
not
recognize
his
own
voice
hal
looked
quickly
at
his
brother
and
was
amazed
and
all
at
once
shaken
why
ken
he
faltered
i
ought
to
have
made
you
take
them
before
interrupted
ken
but
i
ve
been
too
easy
now
hal
listen
and
you
too
george
i
ve
made
a
bad
mess
of
this
trip
i
got
you
into
this
jungle
and
i
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
you
whether
you
would
or
not
george
has
fever
pepe
is
getting
it
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
escape
you
all
drink
unboiled
water
ken
that
s
all
right
but
you
can
get
fever
from
the
bites
of
the
ticks
said
george
i
dare
say
but
just
the
same
you
could
have
been
careful
about
the
water
not
only
that
look
how
careless
we
have
been
think
of
the
things
that
have
happened
we
ve
gotten
almost
wild
on
this
trip
we
don
t
realize
but
wait
till
we
get
home
then
we
ll
hardly
be
able
to
believe
we
ever
had
these
adventures
but
our
foolishness
our
carelessness
must
stop
right
here
if
we
can
t
profit
by
our
lucky
escapes
yesterday
from
that
lassoed
crocodile
and
the
wild
pigs
we
are
simply
no
good
i
love
fun
and
sport
but
there
s
a
limit
hal
remember
what
old
hiram
told
you
about
being
foolhardily
brave
i
think
we
have
been
wonderfully
lucky
now
let
s
deserve
our
good
luck
let
s
not
prove
what
that
tampico
said
let
s
show
we
are
not
just
boys
i
put
it
to
you
straight
i
think
the
real
test
is
yet
to
come
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
no
more
tricks
no
more
drinking
unboiled
water
no
more
shooting
except
in
we
must
not
eat
any
more
meat
no
more
careless
wandering
up
the
banks
no
chances
see
and
fight
the
fever
don
t
give
up
then
when
we
get
out
of
this
awful
jungle
we
can
look
back
at
our
adventures
and
better
we
can
be
sure
we
ve
learned
a
lot
we
shall
have
accomplished
something
and
that
s
learning
now
how
about
it
will
you
help
me
you
can
just
bet
your
life
replied
george
and
he
held
out
his
hand
ken
i
m
with
you
was
hal
s
quiet
promise
and
ken
knew
from
the
way
the
lad
spoke
that
he
was
in
dead
earnest
when
it
came
to
the
last
ditch
hal
ward
was
as
true
as
steel
he
took
the
raw
bitter
quinine
ken
offered
and
swallowed
it
without
a
grimace
good
exclaimed
ken
now
boys
let
s
pack
hal
you
let
your
menagerie
go
there
s
no
use
keeping
your
pets
any
longer
george
you
make
yourself
a
bed
on
the
trunk
and
fix
a
then
lie
down
when
the
boat
had
been
packed
and
all
was
in
readiness
for
the
start
george
was
sound
asleep
they
shoved
off
into
the
current
pepe
and
ken
took
turns
at
the
oars
making
five
miles
an
hour
as
on
the
day
before
they
glided
under
the
shadows
of
the
great
cypresses
along
the
muddy
banks
where
crocodiles
basked
in
the
sun
and
gaunt
cattle
came
down
to
drink
once
the
boat
turned
a
bushy
point
to
startle
a
large
flock
of
wild
turkeys
perhaps
in
number
they
had
been
resting
in
the
cool
sand
along
the
river
some
ran
up
the
bank
some
flew
right
over
the
boat
and
most
of
them
squatted
down
as
if
to
evade
detection
thereafter
turkeys
and
ducks
and
geese
became
so
common
as
to
be
monotonous
about
one
o
clock
ken
sighted
a
thatched
bamboo
and
hut
on
the
bank
oh
boys
look
look
cried
ken
joyfully
hal
was
as
pleased
as
ken
and
george
roused
out
of
his
slumber
pepe
grinned
and
nodded
his
head
some
naked
little
children
ran
like
quail
a
disheveled
black
head
peeped
out
of
a
door
then
swiftly
vanished
indians
said
george
i
don
t
care
replied
ken
they
re
human
beings
people
we
re
getting
somewhere
from
there
on
the
little
bamboo
huts
were
frequently
sighted
and
soon
ken
saw
a
large
one
situated
upon
a
high
bluff
ken
was
wondering
if
these
natives
would
be
hospitable
upon
rounding
the
next
bend
the
boys
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
connecting
river
it
was
twice
as
wide
as
the
santa
rosa
and
quite
swift
tamaulipas
said
pepe
hooray
boys
this
is
the
source
of
the
panuco
sure
as
you
re
born
cried
ken
i
told
you
we
were
getting
somewhere
he
was
overcome
with
the
discovery
this
meant
success
savalo
savalo
exclaimed
pepe
pointing
tarpon
tarpon
what
do
you
think
of
that
way
up
here
we
must
be
a
long
distance
from
said
george
ken
looked
around
over
the
broad
pool
below
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
and
here
and
there
he
saw
swirls
and
big
splashes
and
then
the
silver
sides
of
rolling
tarpon
boys
seeing
we
ve
packed
that
can
of
preserved
mullet
all
the
way
and
those
thundering
heavy
tackles
let
s
try
for
tarpon
suggested
ken
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
the
boys
responded
pepe
was
no
longer
slow
and
heavy
george
forgot
he
was
sick
hal
who
loved
to
fish
better
than
to
hunt
was
as
enthusiastic
as
on
the
first
day
ken
let
me
boss
this
job
said
george
as
he
began
to
rig
the
tackles
pepe
will
row
you
and
hal
sit
back
here
and
troll
i
ll
make
myself
useful
open
the
can
see
i
hook
the
mullet
just
back
of
the
head
letting
the
bar
come
out
free
there
now
run
out
about
forty
feet
of
line
steady
the
butt
of
the
rod
under
your
leg
put
your
left
hand
above
the
reel
hold
the
handle
of
the
reel
in
your
right
and
hold
it
hard
the
drag
is
in
the
handle
now
when
a
tarpon
takes
the
bait
jerk
with
all
your
might
their
mouths
are
like
iron
and
it
s
hard
to
get
a
hook
to
stick
pepe
rowed
at
a
smooth
even
stroke
and
made
for
the
great
curve
of
the
pool
where
tarpon
were
breaking
water
if
they
re
on
the
feed
we
ll
have
more
sport
than
we
ve
had
yet
said
george
ken
was
fascinated
and
saw
that
hal
was
going
to
have
the
best
time
of
the
trip
also
ken
was
very
curious
to
have
a
tarpon
strike
he
had
no
idea
what
it
would
be
like
presently
when
the
boat
glided
among
the
rolling
fish
and
there
was
prospect
of
one
striking
at
any
moment
ken
could
not
subdue
a
mounting
excitement
steady
now
be
ready
warned
george
suddenly
hal
s
line
straightened
the
lad
yelled
and
jerked
at
the
same
instant
there
came
a
roar
of
splitting
waters
and
a
beautiful
silver
fish
longer
than
hal
himself
shot
up
into
the
air
the
tarpon
shook
himself
and
dropped
back
into
the
water
with
a
crash
hal
was
speechless
he
wound
in
his
line
to
find
the
bait
gone
threw
the
hook
said
george
as
he
reached
into
the
can
for
another
bait
he
wasn
t
so
big
you
ll
get
used
to
losing
em
there
try
again
ken
had
felt
several
gentle
tugs
at
his
line
as
if
tarpon
were
rolling
across
it
and
indeed
he
saw
several
fish
swim
right
over
where
his
line
disappeared
in
the
water
there
were
splashes
all
around
the
boat
some
gentle
swishes
and
others
hard
cutting
rushes
then
his
line
straightened
with
a
heavy
jerk
he
forgot
to
try
to
hook
the
fish
indeed
he
had
no
time
the
tarpon
came
half
out
of
the
water
wagged
his
head
and
plumped
back
ken
had
not
hooked
the
fish
nor
had
the
fish
got
the
bait
so
ken
again
let
out
his
line
the
next
thing
which
happened
was
that
the
boys
both
had
strikes
at
the
same
instant
hal
stood
up
and
as
his
tarpon
leaped
it
pulled
him
forward
and
he
fell
into
the
his
rattled
on
the
gunwale
the
line
hissed
ken
leaned
back
and
jerked
his
fish
did
not
break
water
but
he
was
wonderfully
active
under
the
surface
pepe
was
jabbering
george
was
yelling
hal
s
fish
was
tearing
the
water
to
shreds
he
crossed
ken
s
fish
the
lines
fouled
and
then
slacked
ken
began
to
wind
in
hal
rose
to
do
likewise
gee
he
whispered
with
round
eyes
both
lines
had
been
broken
george
made
light
of
this
incident
and
tied
on
two
more
leaders
and
hooks
and
baited
afresh
the
fish
are
on
the
feed
boys
it
s
a
cinch
you
ll
each
catch
one
better
troll
one
at
a
time
unless
you
can
stand
for
crossed
lines
but
ken
and
hal
were
too
eager
to
catch
a
tarpon
to
troll
one
at
a
time
so
once
more
they
let
their
lines
out
a
tarpon
took
hal
s
bait
right
under
the
stern
of
the
boat
hal
struck
with
all
his
might
this
fish
came
up
with
a
tremendous
splash
drenching
the
boys
his
great
gleaming
silver
sides
glistened
in
the
sun
he
curved
his
body
and
straightened
out
with
a
snap
like
the
breaking
of
a
board
and
he
threw
the
hook
whistling
into
the
air
before
hal
had
baited
up
ken
got
another
strike
this
fish
made
five
leaps
one
after
the
other
and
upon
the
last
threw
the
hook
like
a
bullet
as
he
plunged
down
a
beautiful
rainbow
appeared
in
the
misty
spray
hal
do
you
see
that
rainbow
cried
ken
quickly
there
s
a
sight
for
a
fisherman
this
time
in
turn
before
ken
started
to
troll
hal
hooked
another
tarpon
this
one
was
not
so
large
but
he
was
active
his
first
rush
was
a
long
surge
on
the
surface
he
sent
the
spray
in
two
streaks
like
a
then
he
sounded
hang
on
hal
yelled
george
and
ken
in
unison
hal
was
bent
almost
double
and
his
head
was
bobbing
under
the
strain
he
could
not
hold
the
drag
the
line
was
whizzing
out
you
got
that
one
hooked
shouted
george
let
go
the
reel
drop
the
handle
let
him
run
he
complied
and
then
his
fish
began
a
marvelous
exhibition
of
lofty
tumbling
he
seemed
never
to
stay
down
at
all
now
he
shot
up
mouth
wide
gills
spread
eyes
wild
and
he
shook
himself
like
a
wet
dog
then
he
dropped
back
and
before
the
boys
had
time
to
think
where
he
might
be
he
came
up
several
rods
to
the
right
and
cracked
his
gills
like
he
skittered
on
his
tail
and
stood
on
his
head
and
dropped
flat
with
a
heavy
smack
then
he
stayed
under
and
began
to
tug
hang
on
now
cried
george
wind
in
hold
him
tight
don
t
give
him
an
inch
unless
he
jumps
this
was
heartbreaking
work
for
hal
he
toiled
to
keep
the
line
in
he
grew
red
in
the
face
he
dripped
with
sweat
he
panted
for
breath
but
he
hung
on
ken
saw
how
skilfully
pepe
managed
the
boat
the
seemed
to
know
just
which
way
the
fish
headed
and
always
kept
the
boat
straight
sometimes
he
rowed
back
and
lent
his
help
to
hal
but
this
appeared
to
anger
the
tarpon
for
the
line
told
he
was
coming
to
the
surface
then
as
pepe
ceased
to
let
him
feel
the
weight
of
the
boat
the
tarpon
sank
again
so
the
battle
went
on
round
and
round
the
great
pool
after
an
hour
of
it
hal
looked
ready
to
drop
land
him
alone
if
you
can
said
ken
he
s
tiring
hal
i
ll
land
him
or
or
bust
panted
hal
look
out
now
warned
george
again
he
s
coming
up
see
the
line
be
ready
to
trim
the
boat
if
he
drops
aboard
the
tarpon
slipped
smoothly
out
of
the
water
and
shot
right
over
the
bow
of
the
boat
george
flung
out
his
hand
and
threw
hal
s
rod
round
in
time
to
save
the
line
from
catching
the
fish
went
down
came
up
wagging
his
head
and
then
fell
with
sullen
splash
he
s
done
yelled
george
now
hal
hold
him
for
all
you
re
worth
not
an
inch
of
line
pepe
headed
the
boat
for
a
sandy
beach
and
hal
looking
as
if
about
to
have
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
clung
desperately
to
the
bending
rod
the
tarpon
rolled
and
lashed
his
tail
but
his
power
was
mostly
gone
gradually
he
ceased
to
roll
until
by
the
time
pepe
reached
shore
he
was
sliding
wearily
through
the
water
his
silvery
side
glittering
in
the
light
the
boat
grated
on
the
sand
pepe
leaped
out
then
he
grasped
hal
s
line
slipped
his
hands
down
to
the
long
wire
leader
and
with
a
quick
powerful
pull
slid
the
tarpon
out
upon
the
beach
gasped
hal
with
glistening
eyes
ken
just
look
i
m
looking
son
and
don
t
you
forget
it
the
tarpon
lay
inert
a
beautiful
creature
that
looked
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
a
bath
of
melted
opals
the
great
dark
eyes
were
fixed
and
staring
the
tail
moved
feebly
the
long
dorsal
fin
quivered
he
measured
five
feet
six
inches
in
length
which
was
one
inch
more
than
hal
s
height
ken
the
boys
back
home
will
never
believe
i
caught
him
said
hal
in
distress
take
his
picture
to
prove
it
replied
ken
hal
photographed
his
catch
pepe
took
out
the
hook
showing
as
he
did
so
the
great
plates
in
the
mouth
of
the
fish
no
wonder
it
s
hard
to
hook
them
said
ken
hal
certainly
wanted
his
beautiful
fish
to
go
back
free
and
little
hurt
to
the
river
but
also
he
wanted
him
for
a
specimen
hal
deliberated
evidently
he
was
considering
the
labor
of
skinning
such
a
huge
fish
and
the
difficulty
of
preserving
and
packing
the
hide
say
hal
wouldn
t
you
like
to
see
me
hook
one
queried
ken
patiently
that
brought
hal
to
his
senses
sure
ken
old
man
i
want
you
to
catch
one
a
big
one
bigger
than
mine
replied
hal
and
restored
the
fish
to
the
water
they
all
watched
the
liberated
tarpon
swim
wearily
off
and
slip
down
under
the
water
he
ll
have
something
to
tell
the
rest
won
t
he
said
george
in
a
few
minutes
the
boat
was
again
in
the
center
of
the
great
pool
among
the
rolling
tarpon
ken
had
a
strike
immediately
he
missed
then
he
tried
again
and
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
saw
five
tarpon
in
the
air
one
after
the
other
and
not
one
did
he
hook
securely
he
got
six
leaps
out
of
one
however
and
that
was
almost
as
good
as
landing
him
there
re
some
whales
here
said
george
grande
savalo
added
pepe
and
he
rowed
over
to
where
a
huge
fish
was
rolling
oh
i
don
t
want
to
hook
the
biggest
one
first
protested
ken
pepe
rowed
to
and
fro
the
boys
were
busy
trying
to
see
the
rolling
tarpon
there
would
be
a
souse
on
one
side
then
a
splash
on
the
other
then
a
thump
behind
what
with
trying
to
locate
all
these
fish
and
still
keep
an
eye
on
ken
s
line
the
boys
almost
dislocated
their
necks
then
quick
as
a
flash
ken
had
a
strike
that
pulled
him
out
of
his
seat
to
his
knees
he
could
not
jerk
his
line
was
like
a
wire
it
began
to
rise
with
all
his
strength
he
held
on
the
water
broke
in
a
hollow
slow
roar
and
a
huge
humpbacked
tarpon
seemed
to
be
climbing
into
the
air
but
he
did
not
get
all
the
way
out
and
he
plunged
back
with
a
thunderous
crash
he
made
as
much
noise
as
if
a
horse
had
fallen
off
a
bridge
the
handle
of
the
reel
slipped
out
of
ken
s
grasp
and
it
was
well
the
tarpon
made
a
long
wonderful
run
and
showed
on
the
surface
a
hundred
yards
from
the
boat
he
was
irresistibly
powerful
ken
was
astounded
and
thrilled
at
his
strength
and
speed
there
far
away
from
the
boat
the
tarpon
leaped
magnificently
clearing
the
water
and
then
went
down
he
did
not
come
up
again
ken
he
s
a
whale
said
george
i
believe
he
s
well
hooked
he
won
t
jump
any
more
and
you
ve
got
a
job
on
your
hands
i
want
him
to
jump
the
big
ones
seldom
break
water
after
the
first
rush
or
so
ken
it
s
coming
to
you
with
that
fellow
said
hal
my
left
arm
is
paralyzed
honestly
i
can
pinch
it
and
not
feel
the
pain
pepe
worked
the
boat
closer
and
ken
reeled
in
yard
after
yard
of
line
the
tarpon
was
headed
and
he
kept
up
a
steady
strong
strain
let
him
tow
the
boat
said
george
hold
the
drag
ken
let
him
tow
the
boat
what
exclaimed
ken
in
amaze
oh
he
ll
do
it
all
right
and
so
it
proved
ken
s
tarpon
once
headed
with
the
current
did
not
turn
and
he
towed
the
boat
this
is
a
new
way
for
me
to
tire
out
a
fish
said
ken
what
do
you
think
of
it
hal
hal
s
eyes
glistened
this
is
fishing
ken
did
you
see
him
when
he
came
up
not
very
clearly
i
had
you
know
how
a
grouse
looks
when
he
flushes
right
under
your
feet
a
kind
of
brown
blur
well
this
was
the
same
only
silver
at
the
end
of
what
ken
judged
to
be
a
mile
the
tarpon
was
still
going
at
the
end
of
the
second
mile
he
was
tired
and
three
miles
down
the
river
from
where
the
fish
was
hooked
pepe
beached
the
boat
on
a
sandbar
and
hauled
ashore
a
tarpon
six
feet
ten
inches
long
here
ken
echoed
hal
s
panting
gasp
of
wonder
and
exultation
as
he
sat
down
on
the
boat
to
rest
he
had
no
feeling
in
his
left
arm
and
little
in
his
right
his
knuckles
were
skinned
and
bloody
no
game
of
baseball
he
had
ever
pitched
had
taken
his
strength
like
the
conquest
of
this
magnificent
fish
hal
we
ll
have
some
more
of
this
fishing
when
we
get
to
tampico
said
ken
why
this
beats
hunting
you
have
the
sport
and
you
needn
t
kill
anything
this
tarpon
isn
t
hurt
so
ken
photographed
his
prize
and
measured
him
and
taking
a
last
lingering
glance
at
the
great
green
back
the
sides
the
flukes
of
the
tail
at
the
whole
quivering
length
he
slid
the
tarpon
back
into
the
river
much
as
ken
would
have
liked
to
go
back
to
that
pool
he
did
not
think
of
it
twice
and
as
soon
as
the
excitement
had
subsided
and
the
journey
was
resumed
george
and
hal
and
pepe
too
settled
down
into
a
silent
weariness
that
made
ken
anxious
during
the
afternoon
ken
saw
pepe
slowly
droop
lower
and
lower
at
the
oars
till
the
time
came
when
he
could
scarcely
lift
them
to
make
a
stroke
and
when
ken
relieved
him
of
them
pepe
fell
like
a
log
in
the
boat
george
slept
hal
seemed
to
be
fighting
stupor
pepe
lay
motionless
on
his
seat
they
were
all
going
down
with
the
fever
that
ken
knew
and
it
took
all
his
courage
to
face
the
situation
it
warmed
his
heart
to
see
how
hal
was
trying
to
bear
up
under
a
languor
that
must
have
been
impossible
to
resist
at
last
hal
said
ken
let
me
row
he
would
not
admit
that
he
was
sick
ken
thought
it
would
do
hal
no
harm
to
work
but
ken
did
not
want
to
lose
time
so
he
hit
upon
a
plan
that
pleased
him
there
was
an
extra
pair
of
oars
in
the
boat
ken
fashioned
rude
pegs
from
a
stick
and
drove
these
down
into
the
cleat
inside
the
gunwales
with
stout
rope
he
tied
the
oars
to
the
pegs
which
answered
fairly
well
as
oarlocks
then
they
had
a
double
set
of
oars
going
and
made
much
better
time
george
woke
and
declared
that
he
must
take
a
turn
at
the
oars
so
ken
let
him
row
too
and
rested
himself
he
had
a
grim
foreboding
that
he
would
need
all
his
strength
the
succeeding
few
hours
before
sunset
george
and
hal
more
than
made
up
for
all
their
delinquencies
of
the
past
at
first
it
was
not
very
hard
for
them
to
row
but
soon
they
began
to
weary
then
weaken
neither
one
however
would
give
up
ken
let
them
row
knowing
that
it
was
good
for
them
slower
and
slower
grew
george
s
strokes
there
were
times
when
he
jerked
up
spasmodically
and
made
an
effort
only
to
weaken
again
at
last
with
a
groan
he
dropped
the
oars
ken
had
to
lift
him
back
into
the
bow
hal
was
not
so
sick
as
george
and
therefore
not
so
weak
he
lasted
longer
ken
had
seen
the
lad
stick
to
many
a
hard
job
but
never
as
he
did
to
this
one
hal
was
making
good
his
promise
there
were
times
when
his
breath
came
in
whistles
he
would
stop
and
pant
awhile
then
row
on
ken
pretended
he
did
not
notice
but
he
had
never
been
so
proud
of
his
brother
nor
loved
him
so
well
ken
old
man
said
hal
presently
i
was
wrong
about
the
water
i
ought
to
have
obeyed
you
i
i
m
pretty
sick
what
a
confession
for
hal
ward
ken
turned
in
time
to
see
hal
vomit
over
the
gunwale
it
s
pretty
tough
hal
said
ken
as
he
reached
out
to
hold
his
brother
s
head
but
you
re
game
i
m
so
glad
to
see
that
whereupon
hal
went
back
to
his
oars
and
stayed
till
he
dropped
ken
lifted
him
and
laid
him
beside
george
ken
rowed
on
with
his
eyes
ever
in
search
of
a
but
there
was
no
place
to
camp
the
muddy
banks
were
too
narrow
at
the
bottom
too
marshy
and
filthy
and
they
were
too
steep
to
climb
to
the
top
the
sun
set
twilight
fell
darkness
came
on
and
still
ken
rowed
down
the
river
at
last
he
decided
to
make
a
night
of
it
at
the
oars
he
preferred
to
risk
the
dangers
of
the
river
at
night
rather
than
spend
miserable
hours
in
the
mud
rousing
the
boys
he
forced
them
to
swallow
a
little
cold
rice
and
some
more
quinine
then
he
covered
them
with
blankets
and
had
scarce
completed
the
task
when
they
were
deep
in
slumber
then
the
strange
dense
tropical
night
settled
down
upon
ken
the
oars
were
almost
noiseless
and
the
water
gurgled
softly
from
the
bow
overhead
the
expanse
was
dark
blue
with
a
few
palpitating
stars
the
river
was
shrouded
in
gray
gloom
and
the
banks
were
lost
in
black
obscurity
great
fireflies
emphasized
the
darkness
he
trusted
a
good
deal
to
luck
in
the
matter
of
going
right
yet
he
kept
his
ear
keen
for
the
sound
of
quickening
current
and
turned
every
few
strokes
to
peer
sharply
into
the
gloom
he
seemed
to
have
little
sense
of
peril
for
though
he
hit
submerged
logs
and
stranded
on
bars
he
kept
on
unmindful
and
by
and
by
lost
what
anxiety
he
had
felt
the
strange
wildness
of
the
river
at
night
the
gray
veiled
space
into
which
he
rowed
unheeding
began
to
work
upon
his
mind
that
was
a
night
to
remember
a
night
of
sounds
and
smells
of
the
feeling
of
the
cool
mist
the
sight
of
long
dark
and
a
golden
moon
half
hidden
by
clouds
prominent
among
these
was
the
trill
of
river
frogs
the
trill
of
a
northern
frog
was
music
but
that
of
these
great
jungle
frogs
was
more
than
music
close
at
hand
one
would
thrill
ken
with
mellow
rich
notes
and
then
from
far
would
come
the
answer
a
sweet
high
tenor
wilder
than
any
other
wilderness
sound
long
sustained
dying
away
till
he
held
his
breath
to
listen
so
the
hours
passed
and
the
moon
went
down
into
the
weird
shadows
and
the
southern
cross
rose
pale
and
wonderful
gradually
the
stars
vanished
in
a
kind
of
brightening
gray
and
dawn
was
at
hand
ken
felt
weary
for
sleep
and
his
arms
and
back
ached
morning
came
with
its
steely
light
on
the
river
the
rolling
and
melting
of
vapors
the
flight
of
ducks
and
call
of
birds
the
rosy
sun
brought
no
cheer
ken
beached
the
boat
on
a
while
he
was
building
a
fire
george
raised
his
head
and
groaned
but
neither
pepe
nor
hal
moved
ken
cooked
rice
and
boiled
cocoa
which
he
choked
down
he
opened
a
can
of
fruit
and
found
that
most
welcome
then
he
lifted
george
s
head
shook
him
roused
him
and
held
him
and
made
him
eat
and
drink
nor
did
he
neglect
to
put
a
liberal
dose
of
quinine
in
the
food
pepe
was
easily
managed
but
poor
hal
was
almost
unable
to
swallow
something
terribly
grim
mingled
with
a
strong
passionate
thrill
as
ken
looked
at
hal
s
haggard
face
then
ken
ward
knew
how
much
he
could
stand
what
work
he
could
do
to
get
his
brother
out
of
the
jungle
he
covered
the
boys
again
and
pushed
out
the
boat
at
the
moment
he
felt
a
strength
that
he
had
never
felt
before
there
was
a
good
swift
current
in
the
river
and
ken
was
at
great
pains
to
keep
in
it
the
channel
ran
from
one
side
of
the
river
to
the
other
many
times
ken
stranded
on
sandy
shoals
and
had
to
stand
up
and
pole
the
boat
into
deeper
water
this
was
work
that
required
all
his
attention
it
required
more
than
patience
but
as
he
rowed
and
poled
and
drifted
he
studied
the
shallow
ripples
and
learned
to
avoid
the
places
where
the
boat
would
not
float
there
were
stretches
of
river
where
the
water
was
comparatively
deep
and
along
these
he
rested
and
watched
the
shores
as
he
drifted
by
he
saw
no
indian
huts
that
morning
the
jungle
loomed
high
and
dark
a
matted
gray
wall
the
heat
made
the
river
glare
and
smoke
then
where
the
current
quickened
he
rowed
steadily
and
easily
husbanding
his
strength
more
than
all
else
even
the
ravings
of
hal
in
fever
the
thing
that
wore
on
ken
and
made
him
gloomy
was
the
mourning
of
as
there
had
been
thousands
of
these
beautiful
birds
along
the
santa
rosa
river
so
there
were
millions
along
the
panuco
trees
were
blue
with
doves
there
was
an
incessant
soft
sad
moaning
he
fought
his
nervous
sensitive
imaginings
and
for
a
time
he
would
conquer
the
sense
of
some
sad
omen
sung
by
the
doves
then
the
monotony
the
endless
sweet
seemed
to
drown
him
in
melancholy
sound
there
were
three
distinct
tones
a
moan
swelling
to
full
ring
and
dying
away
all
the
afternoon
the
mourning
haunting
song
filled
ken
ward
s
ears
and
when
the
sun
set
and
night
came
with
relief
to
his
tortured
ear
but
not
to
mind
ken
kept
on
without
a
stop
the
day
had
slipped
behind
ken
with
the
miles
and
now
it
was
again
dark
it
seemed
that
he
had
little
sense
of
time
but
his
faculties
of
sight
and
hearing
were
singularly
acute
otherwise
his
mind
was
like
the
weird
gloom
into
which
he
was
drifting
before
the
stars
came
out
the
blackness
was
as
thick
as
pitch
he
could
not
see
a
yard
ahead
he
backed
the
boat
stern
first
and
listened
for
the
soft
murmur
of
ripples
on
shoals
he
avoided
these
by
hearing
alone
occasionally
a
huge
dark
pile
of
driftwood
barred
his
passage
and
he
would
have
to
go
round
it
snags
loomed
up
in
his
path
seemingly
to
reach
for
him
with
long
gaunt
arms
sometimes
he
drifted
upon
from
which
he
would
patiently
pole
the
boat
when
the
heavy
dew
began
to
fall
he
put
on
his
waterproof
coat
the
night
grew
chill
then
the
stars
shone
out
this
lightened
the
river
yet
everywhere
were
shadows
besides
clouds
of
mist
hung
low
in
places
obscuring
the
stars
ken
turned
the
boat
bow
first
downstream
and
rowed
with
slow
even
stroke
he
no
longer
felt
tired
he
seemed
to
have
the
strength
of
a
giant
he
fancied
that
with
one
great
heave
he
could
lift
the
boat
out
of
the
water
or
break
the
oars
from
time
to
time
he
ceased
to
row
and
turning
his
head
he
looked
and
listened
the
river
had
numerous
bends
and
it
was
difficult
for
ken
to
keep
in
the
middle
channel
he
managed
pretty
well
to
keep
right
by
watching
the
dark
where
it
met
the
sky
in
the
bends
the
deepest
water
ran
close
to
the
shore
of
the
outside
curve
and
under
these
high
banks
and
the
leaning
cypresses
shadows
were
thicker
and
blacker
than
in
the
earlier
night
there
was
mystery
in
them
that
ken
felt
the
sounds
he
heard
when
he
stopped
during
these
cautious
resting
intervals
were
the
splashes
of
fish
breaking
water
the
low
hum
of
insects
and
the
trill
of
frogs
the
mourning
of
the
doves
during
daylight
had
haunted
him
and
now
he
felt
the
same
sensation
at
this
exquisitely
sweet
trill
it
pierced
him
racked
him
and
at
last
from
sheer
exhaustion
of
his
sensibilities
he
seemed
not
to
hear
it
any
more
but
to
have
it
in
his
brain
the
moon
rose
behind
the
jungle
wall
silvered
half
of
the
river
and
the
opposite
line
of
cypresses
then
hid
under
clouds
suddenly
near
or
far
away
down
the
river
ken
saw
a
wavering
light
it
was
too
large
for
a
firefly
and
too
steady
he
took
it
for
a
and
for
a
while
it
enhanced
the
unreality
the
ghostliness
of
the
river
but
it
was
the
means
of
bringing
ken
out
of
his
dreamy
gloom
it
made
him
think
the
light
was
moving
it
was
too
wavering
for
a
it
was
coming
it
grew
larger
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
it
vanished
ken
lost
sight
of
it
under
a
deep
shadow
of
overhanging
shore
as
he
reached
a
point
opposite
to
where
it
disappeared
he
thought
he
heard
a
voice
but
he
could
not
be
sure
he
did
not
trust
his
ears
the
incident
however
gave
him
a
chill
what
a
lonesome
ride
he
was
alone
on
that
unknown
river
with
three
sick
boys
in
the
boat
their
lives
depended
upon
his
care
his
strength
his
skill
his
sight
and
hearing
and
the
realization
striking
him
afresh
steeled
his
arms
again
and
his
spirit
the
night
wore
on
the
moon
disappeared
entirely
the
mists
hung
low
like
dim
sheets
along
the
water
ken
was
with
dew
long
periods
of
rowing
he
broke
with
short
intervals
of
drifting
when
he
rested
at
the
oars
then
drowsiness
attacked
him
for
hours
it
seemed
he
fought
it
off
but
at
length
it
grew
overpowering
only
hard
rowing
would
keep
him
awake
and
as
he
wanted
to
reserve
his
strength
he
did
not
dare
exert
himself
violently
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
open
time
after
time
he
found
himself
rowing
when
he
was
half
asleep
the
boat
drifted
against
a
log
and
stopped
ken
drooped
over
his
oars
and
slept
and
yet
he
seemed
not
altogether
to
lose
consciousness
he
roused
again
to
row
on
it
occurred
to
him
presently
that
he
might
let
the
boat
drift
and
take
naps
between
whiles
when
he
drifted
against
a
log
or
a
the
jar
would
awaken
him
the
current
was
sluggish
there
seemed
to
be
no
danger
whatever
he
must
try
to
keep
his
strength
a
little
sleep
would
refresh
him
so
he
reasoned
and
fell
asleep
over
the
oars
sooner
or
later
he
never
knew
how
long
after
he
had
fallen
asleep
a
little
jar
awakened
him
then
the
gurgle
and
murmur
of
water
near
him
and
the
rush
and
roar
of
a
swift
current
farther
off
made
him
look
up
with
a
violent
start
all
about
him
was
wide
gray
gloom
yet
he
could
see
the
dark
glancing
gleam
of
the
water
movement
of
the
oars
told
him
the
boat
was
fast
on
a
that
relieved
him
for
he
was
not
drifting
at
the
moment
into
the
swift
current
he
heard
ken
peered
keenly
into
the
gloom
gradually
he
made
out
a
long
dark
line
running
diagonally
ahead
of
him
and
toward
the
shore
it
could
not
be
an
island
or
a
or
a
it
could
not
be
piles
of
driftwood
there
was
a
strange
regularity
in
the
dark
upheavals
of
this
looming
object
ken
studied
it
he
studied
the
black
glancing
water
whatever
the
line
was
it
appeared
to
shunt
the
current
over
to
the
right
whence
came
the
low
rush
and
roar
altogether
it
was
a
wild
strange
place
ken
felt
a
fear
of
something
he
could
not
name
it
was
the
river
the
night
the
loneliness
the
unknown
about
him
and
before
him
suddenly
he
saw
a
dull
red
light
far
down
the
river
he
stiffened
in
his
seat
then
he
saw
another
red
light
they
were
like
two
red
eyes
ken
shook
himself
to
see
if
he
had
nightmare
no
the
boat
was
there
the
current
was
there
the
boys
were
there
dark
and
silent
under
their
blankets
this
was
no
dream
ken
s
fancy
conjured
up
some
river
demon
come
to
destroy
him
and
his
charges
he
scorned
the
fancy
laughed
at
it
but
all
the
same
in
that
dark
weird
place
with
the
murmuring
of
notes
in
his
ears
and
with
those
strange
red
eyes
glowing
in
the
distance
he
could
not
help
what
his
emotions
made
the
truth
he
was
freezing
to
the
marrow
writhing
in
a
clammy
sweat
when
a
low
enlightened
him
the
red
eyes
were
those
of
a
steamboat
a
steamboat
on
the
wild
panuco
ken
scarcely
believed
his
own
judgment
then
he
remembered
that
george
said
there
were
a
couple
of
boats
plying
up
and
down
the
lower
panuco
mostly
transporting
timber
and
cattle
besides
he
had
proof
of
his
judgment
in
the
long
dark
line
that
had
so
puzzled
him
it
was
a
breakwater
it
turned
the
current
to
the
left
where
there
evidently
was
a
channel
the
great
red
eyes
gleamed
closer
the
sounded
louder
then
another
sound
amazed
ken
a
man
s
voice
crying
out
steadily
and
monotonously
ken
wanted
to
rouse
the
boys
and
pepe
but
he
refrained
it
was
best
for
them
to
sleep
how
surprised
they
would
be
when
he
told
them
about
the
boat
that
passed
in
the
night
ken
now
clearly
heard
the
splashing
of
paddles
the
chug
of
machinery
and
the
man
s
voice
he
was
singsonging
dos
y
media
dos
y
media
dos
y
media
ken
understood
a
little
mexican
and
this
strange
cry
became
clear
to
him
the
man
was
taking
soundings
with
a
lead
and
crying
out
to
the
pilot
y
meant
two
and
a
half
feet
of
water
then
the
loomed
black
in
the
gray
gloom
it
was
pushing
a
low
flat
barge
ken
could
not
see
the
man
taking
soundings
but
he
heard
him
and
knew
he
was
on
the
front
end
of
the
barge
the
boat
passed
at
fair
speed
and
it
cheered
ken
for
he
certainly
ought
to
be
able
to
take
a
rowboat
where
a
steamboat
had
passed
and
besides
he
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
little
village
of
panuco
he
poled
off
the
bar
and
along
the
breakwater
to
the
channel
it
was
narrow
and
swift
he
wondered
how
the
pilot
of
the
steamboat
had
navigated
in
the
gloom
he
slipped
presently
to
find
himself
once
more
in
a
wide
river
refreshed
by
his
sleep
and
encouraged
by
the
meeting
with
the
steamboat
ken
settled
down
to
steady
rowing
the
stars
paled
the
mist
thickened
fog
obscured
the
water
and
shore
then
all
turned
gray
lightened
and
dawn
broke
the
sun
burst
out
ken
saw
thatched
huts
high
on
the
banks
and
occasionally
natives
this
encouraged
him
all
the
more
he
was
not
hungry
but
he
was
sick
for
a
drink
he
had
to
fight
himself
to
keep
from
drinking
the
dirty
how
different
it
was
here
from
the
clear
green
of
the
upper
santa
rosa
ken
would
have
given
his
best
gun
for
one
juicy
orange
george
was
restless
and
rolling
about
calling
for
water
hal
lay
in
slumber
or
stupor
and
pepe
sat
up
he
was
a
fellow
but
he
was
better
and
that
cheered
ken
as
nothing
yet
had
ken
beached
the
boat
on
a
sandy
shore
and
once
again
forced
down
a
little
rice
and
cocoa
pepe
would
not
eat
yet
he
drank
a
little
george
was
burning
up
with
fever
and
drank
a
full
cup
hal
did
not
stir
and
ken
thought
it
best
to
let
him
lie
as
ken
resumed
the
journey
the
next
thing
to
attract
his
attention
was
a
long
canoe
moored
below
one
of
the
thatched
huts
this
afforded
him
great
satisfaction
at
least
he
had
passed
the
jungle
wilderness
where
there
was
nothing
that
even
suggested
civilization
in
the
next
few
miles
he
noticed
several
canoes
and
as
many
natives
then
he
passed
a
canoe
that
was
paddled
by
two
bronze
indians
pepe
hailed
them
but
either
they
were
too
unfriendly
to
reply
or
they
did
not
understand
him
some
distance
below
pepe
espied
a
banana
grove
and
he
motioned
ken
to
row
ashore
ken
did
so
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
getting
some
fresh
fruit
there
was
a
canoe
moored
to
the
roots
of
a
tree
and
a
path
leading
up
the
steep
bank
pepe
got
out
and
laboriously
toiled
up
the
bare
path
he
was
gone
a
good
while
presently
ken
heard
shouts
then
the
bang
of
a
lightly
loaded
gun
then
yells
from
pepe
what
on
earth
cried
ken
looking
up
in
affright
pepe
appeared
with
his
arms
full
of
red
bananas
he
jumped
and
staggered
down
the
path
and
almost
fell
into
the
boat
but
he
hung
on
to
the
bananas
santa
maria
gasped
pepe
pointing
to
little
bloody
spots
on
the
calf
of
his
leg
pepe
you
ve
been
shot
ejaculated
ken
you
stole
the
fruit
somebody
shot
you
pepe
howled
his
affirmative
ken
was
angry
at
himself
angrier
at
pepe
and
angriest
at
the
native
who
had
done
the
shooting
with
a
strong
shove
ken
put
the
boat
out
and
then
rowed
hard
as
he
rounded
a
bend
a
hundred
yards
below
he
saw
three
natives
come
tumbling
down
the
path
they
had
a
gun
they
leaped
into
the
canoe
they
meant
pursuit
say
but
this
is
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
muttered
ken
and
he
bent
to
the
oars
of
course
pepe
had
been
in
the
wrong
he
should
have
paid
for
the
bananas
or
asked
for
them
all
the
same
ken
was
not
in
any
humor
to
be
fooled
with
by
excitable
natives
he
had
a
sick
brother
in
the
boat
and
meant
to
get
that
lad
out
of
the
jungle
as
quickly
as
will
and
strength
could
do
it
he
certainly
did
not
intend
to
be
stopped
by
a
few
miserable
indians
angry
over
the
loss
of
a
few
bananas
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
gun
ken
would
have
stopped
long
enough
to
pay
for
the
fruit
but
he
could
not
risk
it
now
so
he
pulled
a
strong
stroke
the
worst
of
the
matter
developed
when
pepe
peeled
one
of
the
bananas
it
was
too
green
to
eat
presently
the
native
canoe
hove
in
sight
round
the
bend
all
three
men
were
paddling
they
made
the
long
craft
fly
through
the
water
ken
saw
instantly
that
they
would
overhaul
him
in
a
long
race
and
this
added
to
his
resentment
pepe
looked
back
and
jabbered
and
shook
his
brawny
fists
at
the
natives
ken
was
glad
to
see
that
the
long
stretch
of
river
below
did
not
show
a
canoe
or
hut
along
the
banks
he
preferred
to
be
overhauled
if
he
had
to
be
in
a
rather
lonely
spot
it
was
wonderful
how
those
natives
propelled
that
log
canoe
and
when
one
of
the
three
dropped
his
paddle
to
pick
up
the
gun
the
speed
of
the
canoe
seemed
not
to
diminish
they
knew
the
channels
and
so
gained
on
ken
he
had
to
pick
the
best
he
could
choose
at
short
notice
and
sometimes
he
chose
poorly
two
miles
or
more
below
the
bend
the
natives
with
the
gun
deliberately
fired
presumably
at
pepe
the
shot
scattered
and
skipped
along
the
water
and
did
not
come
near
the
boat
nevertheless
as
the
canoe
was
gaining
and
the
crazy
native
was
reloading
ken
saw
he
would
soon
be
within
range
something
had
to
be
done
ken
wondered
if
he
could
not
frighten
those
natives
they
had
probably
never
heard
the
quick
reports
of
a
repeating
rifle
let
alone
the
stinging
cracks
of
an
automatic
ken
decided
it
would
be
worth
trying
but
he
must
have
a
chance
to
get
the
gun
out
of
its
case
and
load
it
that
chance
came
presently
the
natives
in
paddling
diagonally
across
a
narrow
channel
ran
aground
in
the
sand
they
were
fast
for
only
a
few
moments
but
in
that
time
ken
had
got
out
the
little
rifle
and
loaded
it
pepe
s
dark
face
turned
a
dirty
white
and
his
eyes
dilated
he
imagined
ken
was
going
to
kill
some
of
his
countrymen
but
pepe
never
murmured
he
rubbed
the
place
in
his
leg
where
he
had
been
shot
and
looked
back
ken
rowed
on
now
leisurely
there
was
a
hot
anger
within
him
but
he
had
it
in
control
he
knew
what
he
was
about
again
the
native
fired
and
again
his
range
was
short
the
distance
was
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
ken
waited
until
the
canoe
in
crossing
one
of
the
many
narrow
places
was
broadside
toward
him
then
he
raised
the
automatic
there
were
at
least
ten
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
canoe
where
it
was
safe
for
him
to
hit
without
harm
to
the
natives
and
there
he
aimed
the
motion
of
his
boat
made
it
rather
hard
to
keep
the
sights
right
he
was
cool
careful
he
aimed
low
between
gunwale
and
the
water
and
steadily
he
pulled
the
trigger
once
twice
three
times
four
five
the
bullets
spoued
on
the
water
and
cracked
into
the
canoe
they
evidently
split
both
gunwales
low
down
at
the
the
yelling
natives
plunged
about
and
what
with
their
actions
and
the
great
split
in
the
middle
the
canoe
filled
and
sank
the
natives
were
not
over
their
depth
that
was
plainly
evident
moreover
it
was
equally
evident
that
they
dared
not
wade
in
the
quicksand
so
they
swam
to
the
shallower
water
and
there
like
huge
turtles
floundered
toward
the
shore
of
the
before
the
natives
had
reached
the
shore
they
were
hidden
from
ken
s
sight
by
leaning
ken
however
had
no
fear
for
their
safety
he
was
sorry
to
cause
the
indians
loss
of
a
gun
and
a
canoe
nevertheless
he
was
not
far
from
echoing
pepe
s
repeated
bueno
bueno
bueno
upon
examination
ken
found
two
little
bloody
holes
in
the
muscles
of
pepe
s
leg
a
single
shot
had
passed
through
ken
bathed
the
wounds
with
an
antiseptic
lotion
and
bound
them
with
clean
bandages
pepe
appeared
to
be
pretty
weak
so
ken
did
not
ask
him
to
take
the
oars
then
pulling
with
long
steady
stroke
ken
set
out
to
put
a
long
stretch
between
him
and
the
angry
natives
the
current
was
swift
and
ken
made
five
miles
or
more
an
hour
he
kept
that
pace
for
three
hours
without
a
rest
and
then
he
gave
out
it
seemed
that
all
at
once
he
weakened
his
back
bore
an
immense
burden
his
arms
were
lead
and
his
hands
were
useless
there
was
an
occasional
mist
or
veil
before
his
sight
he
was
wet
hot
breathless
numb
but
he
knew
he
was
safe
from
pursuit
so
he
rested
and
let
the
boat
drift
george
sat
up
green
in
the
face
a
most
boy
but
that
he
could
sit
up
at
all
was
hopeful
oh
my
head
he
moaned
is
there
anything
i
can
drink
my
mouth
is
dry
pasted
shut
ken
had
two
lemons
he
had
been
saving
he
cut
one
in
halves
and
divided
it
between
pepe
and
george
the
relief
the
sour
lemon
afforded
both
showed
ken
how
wise
he
had
been
to
save
the
lemons
then
he
roused
hal
and
lifting
the
lad
s
head
made
him
drink
a
little
of
the
juice
hal
was
a
sick
boy
too
weak
to
sit
up
without
help
don
t
you
worry
ken
he
said
i
m
going
to
be
all
right
hal
was
still
fighting
ken
readjusted
the
shelter
over
the
boys
so
as
to
shade
them
effectually
from
the
hot
sun
and
then
he
went
back
to
the
oars
as
he
tried
once
more
to
row
ken
was
reminded
of
the
terrible
lassitude
that
had
overtaken
him
the
day
he
had
made
the
climb
out
of
the
grand
cañon
the
sensation
now
was
worse
but
ken
had
others
depending
upon
his
exertions
and
that
spurred
him
to
the
effort
which
otherwise
would
have
been
impossible
it
was
really
not
rowing
that
ken
accomplished
it
was
a
weary
puttering
with
oars
he
could
not
lift
handles
he
could
not
hold
at
best
he
managed
to
guide
the
boat
into
the
swiftest
channels
whenever
he
felt
that
he
was
just
about
to
collapse
then
he
would
look
at
hal
s
pale
face
that
would
revive
him
so
the
hot
hours
dragged
by
they
came
after
several
miles
upon
more
huts
and
natives
and
farther
down
they
met
canoes
on
the
river
pepe
interrogated
the
natives
according
to
george
who
listened
panuco
was
far
far
away
many
kilometers
this
was
most
disheartening
another
native
said
the
village
was
just
round
the
next
bend
this
was
most
nappy
information
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
lie
there
was
no
village
around
any
particular
bend
nothing
save
bare
banks
for
miles
the
stretches
of
the
river
were
long
and
bends
far
apart
ken
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
he
found
pepe
at
the
oars
watching
him
ken
fancied
he
was
recovering
and
was
overjoyed
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
pepe
rowed
ashore
and
beached
the
boat
at
the
foot
of
a
trail
leading
up
to
a
large
bamboo
and
thatch
hut
this
time
ken
thought
it
well
to
accompany
pepe
and
as
he
climbed
the
path
he
found
his
legs
stiffer
and
shakier
than
ever
before
ken
saw
a
cleared
space
in
which
were
several
commodious
huts
gardens
and
flowers
there
was
a
grassy
yard
in
which
little
naked
children
were
playing
with
tame
deer
and
parrots
were
screeching
and
other
tame
birds
fluttered
about
it
appeared
a
real
paradise
to
ken
two
very
kindly
disposed
and
wondering
native
women
made
them
welcome
then
ken
and
pepe
went
down
to
the
boat
and
carried
hal
up
and
went
back
for
george
it
developed
that
the
native
women
knew
just
what
to
do
for
the
boys
they
made
some
kind
of
a
native
drink
for
them
and
after
that
gave
them
hot
milk
and
chicken
and
rice
soup
george
improved
rapidly
and
hal
brightened
a
little
and
showed
signs
of
gathering
strength
ken
could
not
eat
until
he
had
something
to
quench
his
thirst
upon
inquiring
pepe
found
that
the
natives
used
the
ken
could
not
drink
that
then
pepe
pointed
out
an
and
ken
made
a
dive
for
it
the
ground
was
littered
with
oranges
collecting
an
armful
ken
sat
under
the
tree
and
with
wild
haste
began
to
squeeze
the
juice
into
his
mouth
never
had
anything
before
tasted
so
cool
so
sweet
so
he
felt
a
cool
wet
sensation
steal
all
through
his
body
he
never
knew
till
that
moment
how
really
wonderful
and
precious
an
orange
could
be
he
thought
that
as
he
would
hate
mourning
all
the
rest
of
his
life
so
he
would
love
the
sight
and
smell
and
taste
of
oranges
and
he
demolished
before
he
satisfied
his
almost
insatiable
thirst
after
that
the
chicken
and
rice
made
him
feel
like
a
new
boy
then
ken
made
beds
under
a
kind
of
porch
and
he
lay
down
in
one
stretched
out
languidly
and
gratefully
as
if
he
never
intended
to
move
again
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
glued
shut
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
in
his
face
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
it
had
been
shining
at
his
back
he
consulted
his
watch
he
had
slept
seventeen
hours
when
he
got
up
and
found
pepe
as
well
as
before
he
had
been
taken
with
the
fever
and
george
on
his
feet
and
hal
awake
and
actually
smiling
ken
experienced
a
sensation
of
unutterable
thankfulness
a
terrible
burden
slipped
from
his
shoulders
for
a
moment
he
felt
a
dimming
of
his
eyes
and
a
lump
in
his
throat
how
about
you
ken
old
man
inquired
hal
with
a
hint
of
his
usual
spirit
wal
youngster
i
reckon
fer
a
man
who
s
been
through
some
right
pert
happenin
s
i
m
in
tol
able
shape
drawled
ken
i
ll
bet
two
dollars
you
ve
been
up
against
it
declared
hal
solemnly
then
as
they
sat
to
an
appetizing
breakfast
ken
gave
them
a
brief
account
of
the
incidents
of
the
two
days
and
two
nights
when
they
were
too
ill
to
know
anything
it
was
a
question
whether
george
s
voluble
eulogy
of
ken
s
feat
or
hal
s
silent
pride
in
his
brother
was
the
greater
compliment
finally
hal
said
won
t
that
tickle
jim
williams
when
we
tell
him
how
you
split
up
the
indians
canoe
and
spilled
them
into
the
river
then
ken
conceived
the
idea
of
climbing
into
the
giant
ceiba
that
stood
high
on
the
edge
of
the
bluff
it
was
hard
work
but
he
accomplished
it
and
from
a
fork
in
the
branches
he
looked
out
that
was
a
warm
rich
wonderful
scene
ken
felt
that
he
would
never
forget
it
his
interest
now
however
was
not
so
much
in
its
beauty
and
wildness
his
keen
eye
followed
the
river
as
it
wound
away
into
the
jungle
and
when
he
could
no
longer
see
the
bright
ribbon
of
water
he
followed
its
course
by
the
line
of
magnificent
trees
it
was
possible
to
trace
the
meandering
course
of
the
river
clear
to
the
rise
of
the
mountains
dim
and
blue
in
the
distance
and
from
here
ken
made
more
observations
and
notes
as
he
went
over
in
his
mind
the
map
and
notes
and
report
he
had
prepared
he
felt
that
he
had
made
good
he
had
explored
and
mapped
more
than
a
hundred
miles
of
wild
jungle
river
he
felt
confident
that
he
had
earned
the
trip
to
england
and
the
german
forests
he
might
win
a
hunting
trip
on
the
vast
uplands
of
british
east
africa
but
he
felt
also
that
the
reward
of
his
uncle
s
and
his
father
s
pride
would
be
more
to
him
that
was
a
great
moment
for
ken
ward
and
there
was
yet
much
more
that
he
could
do
to
make
this
exploring
trip
a
success
illustration
ken
ward
s
map
when
he
joined
the
others
he
found
that
pepe
had
learned
that
the
village
of
panuco
was
distant
a
day
or
a
night
by
canoe
how
many
miles
or
kilometers
pepe
could
not
learn
ken
decided
it
would
be
best
to
go
on
at
once
it
was
not
easy
to
leave
that
pleasant
place
with
its
music
of
parrots
and
other
birds
and
the
that
played
like
kittens
and
the
deer
that
ate
from
the
hand
the
women
would
accept
no
pay
so
ken
made
them
presents
once
more
embarked
ken
found
his
mood
reverting
to
that
of
the
last
hours
he
could
not
keep
cheerful
the
river
was
dirty
and
the
smell
sickening
the
sun
was
like
the
open
door
of
a
furnace
and
ken
soon
discovered
he
was
tired
utterly
tired
that
day
was
a
repetition
of
the
one
before
hotter
wearier
and
the
stretches
of
river
were
longer
and
the
natives
met
in
canoes
were
stolidly
ignorant
of
distance
the
mourning
of
almost
drove
ken
wild
there
were
miles
and
miles
of
willows
and
every
tree
was
full
of
melancholy
doves
at
dusk
the
boys
halted
on
a
too
tired
to
cook
a
dinner
and
sprawled
in
the
warm
sand
to
sleep
like
logs
in
the
morning
they
brightened
up
a
little
for
surely
just
around
the
bend
they
would
come
to
panuco
pepe
rowed
faithfully
on
and
bend
after
bend
lured
ken
with
deceit
he
was
filled
with
weariness
and
disgust
so
tired
he
could
hardly
lift
his
hand
so
sleepy
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
eyes
open
he
hated
the
wide
glassy
stretches
of
river
and
the
muddy
banks
and
dusty
cattle
at
noon
they
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
cluster
of
thatched
huts
to
find
that
they
made
up
the
village
of
panuco
ken
was
sick
for
he
had
expected
a
little
town
where
they
could
get
some
and
hire
a
launch
to
speed
them
down
to
tampico
this
appeared
little
more
than
the
other
places
he
had
passed
and
he
climbed
up
the
bank
wearily
thinking
of
the
long
fifty
miles
still
to
go
but
panuco
was
bigger
and
better
than
it
looked
from
the
river
the
boys
found
a
clean
comfortable
inn
where
they
dined
well
and
learned
to
their
joy
that
a
coach
left
in
an
hour
for
tamos
to
meet
the
clock
train
to
tampico
they
hired
a
to
row
the
boat
to
tampico
and
carrying
the
lighter
things
boarded
the
coach
and
behind
six
mules
were
soon
bowling
over
a
good
level
road
it
was
here
that
the
spirit
of
ken
s
mood
again
changed
and
somehow
seemed
subtly
conveyed
to
the
others
the
gloom
faded
away
as
ken
had
seen
the
dissolve
in
the
morning
sunlight
it
was
the
end
of
another
wild
trip
hal
was
ill
but
a
rest
and
proper
care
would
soon
bring
him
around
ken
had
some
trophies
and
pictures
but
he
also
had
memories
and
he
believed
he
had
acquired
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
jungle
and
its
wild
nature
and
he
had
mapped
the
river
from
micas
falls
to
panuco
well
it
certainly
to
us
didn
t
it
asked
george
naïvely
for
the
hundredth
time
didn
t
i
tell
you
by
gosh
i
can
t
remember
what
did
come
off
but
we
had
a
dandy
time
great
replied
ken
i
had
more
than
i
wanted
i
ll
never
spring
another
stunt
like
this
one
hal
gazed
smilingly
at
his
brother
bah
ken
ward
bring
on
your
next
old
trip
which
proved
decidedly
that
hal
was
getting
better
and
that
he
alone
understood
his
brother
pepe
listened
and
rubbed
his
big
hands
and
there
was
a
light
in
his
dark
eyes
ken
laughed
it
was
good
to
feel
happy
just
then
it
was
enough
to
feel
safe
and
glad
in
the
present
with
responsibility
removed
without
a
thought
of
the
future
yet
when
some
miles
across
country
he
saw
the
little
town
of
tamos
shining
against
the
sky
he
came
into
his
own
again
the
old
calling
haunting
love
of
wild
places
and
wild
nature
returned
and
with
dreamy
eyes
he
looked
out
he
saw
the
same
beauty
and
life
and
wildness
beyond
the
glimmering
lagoons
stretched
the
dim
dark
jungle
a
flock
of
flamingoes
showed
pink
across
the
water
ducks
dotted
the
weedy
marshes
and
low
down
on
the
rosy
horizon
a
long
curved
line
of
wild
geese
sailed
into
the
sunset
when
the
boys
arrived
at
tampico
and
george
had
secured
comfortable
lodgings
for
them
the
first
thing
ken
did
was
to
put
hal
to
bed
it
required
main
strength
to
do
this
ken
was
not
taking
any
chances
with
tropical
fever
and
he
sent
for
a
doctor
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
faces
hal
made
were
at
the
little
doctor
or
at
the
medicine
he
administered
however
it
was
very
clear
that
hal
made
fun
of
him
and
grew
bolder
the
more
he
believed
the
man
could
not
understand
english
ken
liked
the
silent
kindly
physician
and
remonstrated
with
hal
and
often
just
to
keep
hal
s
mind
occupied
he
would
talk
of
the
university
and
baseball
topics
that
were
absorbing
to
the
boy
and
one
day
as
the
doctor
was
leaving
he
turned
to
ken
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
said
in
perfect
english
i
won
t
need
to
come
any
more
hal
s
jaw
began
to
drop
your
brother
is
all
right
went
on
the
doctor
but
he
s
a
fresh
kid
and
he
ll
never
make
the
wayne
varsity
or
a
good
explorer
either
till
he
gets
over
that
freshness
i
m
a
wayne
man
myself
class
of
good
day
boys
ken
ward
was
astounded
by
george
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
s
a
wayne
med
i
ll
have
to
look
him
up
and
hal
he
was
just
right
about
you
hal
looked
extremely
crestfallen
and
remorseful
i
m
always
getting
jars
it
took
a
whole
day
for
him
to
recover
his
usual
spirits
ken
had
promptly
sent
the
specimens
and
his
notes
to
his
uncle
and
as
the
days
passed
the
boys
began
to
look
anxiously
for
some
news
in
ten
days
hal
was
as
well
as
ever
and
then
the
boys
had
such
sport
with
the
tarpon
and
big
sharks
and
that
they
almost
forgot
about
the
rewards
they
had
striven
so
hard
for
and
hoped
to
win
but
finally
when
the
mail
arrived
from
home
they
were
at
once
happy
and
fearful
george
was
with
them
that
evening
and
shared
their
excitement
and
suspense
hal
s
letters
were
from
his
mother
and
his
sister
and
they
were
read
first
judge
ward
s
letter
to
ken
was
fatherly
and
solicitous
but
brief
he
gave
the
boys
six
more
weeks
cautioned
them
to
be
sensible
and
to
profit
by
their
opportunity
and
he
inclosed
a
not
a
word
about
rewards
ken
s
fingers
trembled
a
little
as
he
tore
open
the
uncle
s
letter
he
read
it
aloud
dear
ken
congratulations
you
ve
done
well
you
win
the
trip
to
africa
hal
s
work
also
was
good
several
specimens
accepted
by
the
smithsonian
i
ll
back
you
for
the
yucatan
trip
will
send
letters
to
the
american
consul
at
progreso
and
arrange
for
you
to
meet
the
austrian
archæologist
maler
who
i
hope
will
take
you
in
hand
i
want
you
to
make
a
study
of
some
of
the
ruins
of
yucatan
which
i
believe
are
as
wonderful
as
any
in
egypt
i
advise
you
to
make
this
trip
short
and
to
the
point
for
there
are
indications
of
coming
revolution
throughout
mexico
with
best
wishes
uncle
the
old
varsity
cheer
rang
out
from
ken
and
hal
began
a
then
both
boys
pounced
upon
george
and
for
a
few
moments
made
life
miserable
for
him
