i
it
was
time
in
southern
california
but
was
late
at
the
senora
moreno
the
fates
had
seemed
to
combine
to
put
it
off
in
the
first
place
felipe
moreno
had
been
ill
he
was
the
senora
eldest
son
and
since
his
father
death
had
been
at
the
head
of
his
mother
house
without
him
nothing
could
be
done
on
the
ranch
the
senora
thought
it
had
been
always
ask
senor
felipe
go
to
senor
felipe
senor
felipe
will
attend
to
it
ever
since
felipe
had
had
the
dawning
of
a
beard
on
his
handsome
face
in
truth
it
was
not
felipe
but
the
senora
who
really
decided
all
questions
from
greatest
to
least
and
managed
everything
on
the
place
from
the
to
the
but
nobody
except
the
senora
herself
knew
this
an
exceedingly
clever
woman
for
her
day
and
generation
was
senora
gonzaga
moreno
as
for
that
matter
exceedingly
clever
for
any
day
and
generation
but
exceptionally
clever
for
the
day
and
generation
to
which
she
belonged
her
life
the
mere
surface
of
it
if
it
had
been
written
would
have
made
a
romance
to
grow
hot
and
cold
over
sixty
years
of
the
best
of
old
spain
and
the
wildest
of
new
spain
bay
of
biscay
gulf
of
mexico
pacific
ocean
the
waves
of
them
all
had
tossed
destinies
for
the
senora
the
holy
catholic
church
had
had
its
arms
round
her
from
first
to
last
and
that
was
what
had
brought
her
safe
through
she
would
have
said
if
she
had
ever
said
anything
about
herself
which
she
never
did
one
of
her
many
wisdoms
so
quiet
so
reserved
so
gentle
an
exterior
never
was
known
to
veil
such
an
imperious
and
passionate
nature
brimful
of
storm
always
passing
through
stress
never
thwarted
except
at
peril
of
those
who
did
it
adored
and
hated
by
turns
and
each
at
the
hottest
a
tremendous
force
wherever
she
appeared
was
senora
moreno
but
no
stranger
would
suspect
it
to
see
her
gliding
about
in
her
scanty
black
gown
with
her
rosary
hanging
at
her
side
her
soft
dark
eyes
cast
down
and
an
expression
of
mingled
melancholy
and
devotion
on
her
face
she
looked
simply
like
a
sad
old
lady
amiable
and
indolent
like
her
race
but
sweeter
and
more
thoughtful
than
their
wont
her
voice
heightened
this
mistaken
impression
she
was
never
heard
to
speak
either
loud
or
fast
there
was
at
times
even
a
curious
hesitancy
in
her
speech
which
came
near
being
a
stammer
or
suggested
the
measured
care
with
which
people
speak
who
have
been
cured
of
stammering
it
made
her
often
appear
as
if
she
did
not
known
her
own
mind
at
which
people
sometimes
took
heart
when
if
they
had
only
known
the
truth
they
would
have
known
that
the
speech
hesitated
solely
because
the
senora
knew
her
mind
so
exactly
that
she
was
finding
it
hard
to
make
the
words
convey
it
as
she
desired
or
in
a
way
to
best
attain
her
ends
about
this
very
there
had
been
between
her
and
the
head
shepherd
juan
canito
called
juan
can
for
short
and
to
distinguish
him
from
juan
jose
the
upper
herdsman
of
the
cattle
some
discussions
which
would
have
been
hot
and
angry
ones
in
any
other
hands
than
the
senora
juan
canito
wanted
the
shearing
to
begin
even
though
senor
felipe
were
ill
in
bed
and
though
that
lazy
shepherd
luigo
had
not
yet
got
back
with
the
flock
that
had
been
driven
up
the
coast
for
pasture
there
were
plenty
of
sheep
on
the
place
to
begin
with
he
said
one
morning
at
least
a
thousand
and
by
the
time
they
were
done
luigo
would
surely
be
back
with
the
rest
and
as
for
senor
felipe
being
in
bed
had
not
he
juan
canito
stood
at
the
and
handled
the
wool
when
senor
felipe
was
a
boy
why
could
he
not
do
it
again
the
senora
did
not
realize
how
time
was
going
there
would
be
no
shearers
to
be
hired
presently
since
the
senora
was
determined
to
have
none
but
indians
of
course
if
she
would
employ
mexicans
as
all
the
other
ranches
in
the
valley
did
it
would
be
different
but
she
was
resolved
upon
having
indians
god
knows
why
he
interpolated
surlily
under
his
breath
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
juan
interrupted
senora
moreno
at
the
precise
instant
the
last
syllable
of
this
disrespectful
ejaculation
had
escaped
juan
lips
speak
a
little
louder
i
fear
i
am
growing
deaf
in
my
old
what
gentle
suave
courteous
tones
and
the
calm
dark
eyes
rested
on
juan
canito
with
a
look
to
the
fathoming
of
which
he
was
as
unequal
as
one
of
his
own
sheep
would
have
been
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
instantly
and
involuntarily
said
beg
your
pardon
oh
you
need
not
ask
my
pardon
juan
the
senora
replied
with
exquisite
gentleness
it
is
not
you
who
are
to
blame
if
i
am
deaf
i
have
fancied
for
a
year
i
did
not
hear
quite
as
well
as
i
once
did
but
about
the
indians
juan
did
not
senor
felipe
tell
you
that
he
had
positively
engaged
the
same
band
of
shearers
we
had
last
autumn
alessandro
band
from
temecula
they
will
wait
until
we
are
ready
for
them
senor
felipe
will
send
a
messenger
for
them
he
thinks
them
the
best
shearers
in
the
country
he
will
be
well
enough
in
a
week
or
two
he
thinks
and
the
poor
sheep
must
bear
their
loads
a
few
days
longer
are
they
looking
well
do
you
think
juan
will
the
crop
be
a
good
one
general
moreno
used
to
say
that
you
could
reckon
up
the
to
a
pound
while
it
was
on
the
sheep
yes
senora
answered
the
mollified
juan
the
poor
beasts
look
wonderfully
well
considering
the
scant
feed
they
have
had
all
winter
we
not
come
many
pounds
short
of
our
last
year
crop
if
any
though
to
be
sure
there
is
no
telling
in
what
case
that
luigo
will
bring
his
flock
the
senora
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
pause
and
gulp
with
which
juan
had
filled
in
the
hiatus
where
he
had
longed
to
set
a
contemptuous
epithet
before
luigo
name
this
was
another
of
the
instances
where
the
senora
will
and
juan
canito
had
clashed
and
he
did
not
dream
of
it
having
set
it
all
down
as
usual
to
the
score
of
young
senor
felipe
encouraged
by
the
senora
smile
juan
proceeded
senor
felipe
can
see
no
fault
in
luigo
because
they
were
boys
together
but
i
can
tell
him
he
will
rue
it
one
of
these
mornings
when
he
finds
a
flock
of
sheep
worse
than
dead
on
his
hands
and
no
thanks
to
anybody
but
luigo
while
i
can
have
him
under
my
eye
here
in
the
valley
it
is
all
very
well
but
he
is
no
more
fit
to
take
responsibility
of
a
flock
than
one
of
the
very
lambs
themselves
he
drive
them
off
their
feet
one
day
and
starve
them
the
next
and
i
known
him
to
forget
to
give
them
water
when
he
in
his
dreams
the
virgin
only
knows
what
he
wo
during
this
brief
and
almost
unprecedented
outburst
of
juan
the
senora
countenance
had
been
slowly
growing
stern
juan
had
not
seen
it
his
eyes
had
been
turned
away
from
her
looking
down
into
the
upturned
eager
face
of
his
favorite
collie
who
was
leaping
and
gambolling
and
barking
at
his
feet
down
capitan
down
he
said
in
a
fond
tone
gently
repulsing
him
thou
makest
such
a
noise
the
senora
can
hear
nothing
but
thy
i
heard
only
too
distinctly
juan
canito
said
the
senora
in
a
sweet
but
icy
tone
it
is
not
well
for
one
servant
to
backbite
another
it
gives
me
great
grief
to
hear
such
words
and
i
hope
when
father
salvierderra
comes
next
month
you
will
not
forget
to
confess
this
sin
of
which
you
have
been
guilty
in
thus
seeking
to
injure
a
if
senor
felipe
listens
to
you
the
poor
boy
luigo
will
be
cast
out
homeless
on
the
world
some
day
and
what
sort
of
a
deed
would
that
be
juan
canito
for
one
christian
to
do
to
another
i
fear
the
father
will
give
you
penance
when
he
hears
what
you
have
senora
it
is
not
to
harm
the
lad
juan
began
every
fibre
of
his
faithful
frame
thrilling
with
a
sense
of
the
injustice
of
her
reproach
but
the
senora
had
turned
her
back
evidently
she
would
hear
no
more
from
him
then
he
stood
watching
her
as
she
walked
away
at
her
usual
slow
pace
her
head
slightly
bent
forward
her
rosary
lifted
in
her
left
hand
and
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
mechanically
slipping
the
beads
prayers
always
prayers
thought
juan
to
himself
as
his
eyes
followed
her
if
they
take
one
to
heaven
the
senora
go
by
the
straight
road
that
sure
i
sorry
i
vexed
her
but
what
a
man
to
do
if
he
the
interest
of
the
place
at
heart
i
like
to
know
is
he
to
stand
by
and
see
a
lot
of
idle
mooning
louts
run
away
with
everything
ah
but
it
was
an
ill
day
for
the
estate
when
the
general
died
an
ill
day
an
ill
day
and
they
may
scold
me
as
much
as
they
please
and
set
me
to
confessing
my
sins
to
the
father
it
very
well
for
them
got
me
to
look
after
matters
senor
felipe
will
do
well
enough
when
a
man
maybe
but
a
boy
like
him
bah
and
the
old
man
stamped
his
foot
with
a
not
wholly
unreasonable
irritation
at
the
false
position
in
which
he
felt
himself
put
confess
to
father
salvierderra
indeed
he
muttered
aloud
ay
that
will
i
he
a
man
of
sense
if
he
is
a
priest
at
which
slip
of
the
tongue
the
pious
juan
hastily
crossed
himself
and
i
ask
him
to
give
me
some
good
advice
as
to
how
i
to
manage
between
this
young
boy
at
the
head
of
everything
and
a
doting
mother
who
thinks
he
has
the
wisdom
of
a
dozen
grown
men
the
father
knew
the
place
in
the
olden
time
he
knows
it
no
child
play
to
look
after
the
estate
even
now
much
smaller
as
it
is
an
ill
day
when
the
old
general
died
an
ill
day
indeed
the
saints
rest
his
soul
saying
this
juan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
whistling
to
capitan
walked
towards
the
sunny
veranda
of
the
south
side
of
the
kitchen
wing
of
the
house
where
it
had
been
for
twenty
odd
years
his
habit
to
sit
on
the
long
bench
and
smoke
his
pipe
of
a
morning
before
he
had
got
across
the
however
a
thought
struck
him
he
halted
so
suddenly
that
capitan
with
the
quick
sensitiveness
of
his
breed
thought
so
sudden
a
change
of
purpose
could
only
come
from
something
in
connection
with
sheep
and
true
to
his
instinct
of
duty
pricked
up
his
ears
poised
himself
for
a
full
run
and
looked
up
in
his
master
face
waiting
for
explanation
and
signal
but
juan
did
not
observe
him
ha
he
said
father
salvierderra
comes
next
month
does
he
see
is
the
that
it
the
is
not
to
come
off
till
the
father
gets
here
then
each
morning
it
will
be
mass
in
the
chapel
and
each
night
vespers
and
the
crowd
will
be
here
at
least
two
days
longer
to
feed
for
the
time
they
will
lose
by
that
and
by
the
confessions
that
what
senor
felipe
is
up
to
he
a
pious
lad
i
recollect
now
it
was
the
same
way
two
years
ago
well
well
it
is
a
good
thing
for
those
poor
indian
devils
to
get
a
bit
of
religion
now
and
then
and
it
like
old
times
to
see
the
chapel
full
of
them
kneeling
and
more
than
can
get
in
at
the
door
i
doubt
not
it
warms
the
heart
to
see
them
all
there
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
house
as
they
used
to
and
now
i
know
when
it
to
be
i
have
only
to
make
my
arrangements
accordingly
it
is
always
in
the
first
week
of
the
month
the
father
gets
here
yes
she
said
felipe
will
be
well
enough
in
a
week
or
two
he
thinks
ha
ha
it
will
be
nearer
two
ten
days
or
thereabouts
i
begin
the
booths
next
week
a
plague
on
that
luigo
for
not
being
back
here
he
the
best
hand
i
have
to
cut
the
willow
boughs
for
the
roofs
he
knows
the
difference
between
one
year
growth
and
another
i
say
that
much
for
him
spite
of
the
silly
dreaming
head
he
got
on
his
juan
was
so
pleased
with
his
clearing
up
in
his
mind
as
to
senor
felipe
purpose
about
the
time
of
the
that
it
put
him
in
good
humor
for
the
day
good
humor
with
everybody
and
himself
most
of
all
as
he
sat
on
the
low
bench
his
head
leaning
back
against
the
whitewashed
wall
his
long
legs
stretched
out
nearly
across
the
whole
width
of
the
veranda
his
pipe
firm
wedged
in
the
extreme
left
corner
of
his
mouth
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
was
the
picture
of
placid
content
the
troop
of
youngsters
which
still
swarmed
around
the
kitchen
quarters
of
senora
moreno
house
almost
as
numerous
and
inexplicable
as
in
the
grand
old
days
of
the
general
time
ran
back
and
forth
across
juan
legs
fell
down
between
them
and
picked
themselves
up
by
help
of
clutches
at
his
leather
trousers
all
unreproved
by
juan
though
loudly
scolded
and
warned
by
their
respective
mothers
from
the
kitchen
what
come
to
juan
can
to
be
so
saucily
asked
margarita
the
youngest
and
prettiest
of
the
maids
popping
her
head
out
of
a
window
and
twitching
juan
hair
he
was
so
gray
and
wrinkled
that
the
maids
all
felt
at
ease
with
him
he
seemed
to
them
as
old
as
methuselah
but
he
was
not
really
so
old
as
they
thought
nor
they
so
safe
in
their
tricks
the
old
man
had
hot
blood
in
his
veins
yet
as
the
could
testify
the
sight
of
your
pretty
face
senorita
margarita
answered
juan
quickly
cocking
his
eye
at
her
rising
to
his
feet
and
making
a
mock
bow
towards
the
window
he
he
senorita
indeed
chuckled
margarita
mother
old
marda
the
cook
senor
juan
canito
is
pleased
to
be
merry
at
the
doors
of
his
betters
and
she
flung
a
copper
saucepan
full
of
not
water
so
deftly
past
juan
head
that
not
a
drop
touched
him
and
yet
he
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
ducked
at
which
bit
of
the
whole
young
and
old
babies
cocks
hens
and
turkeys
all
set
up
a
shout
and
a
cackle
and
dispersed
to
the
four
corners
of
the
yard
as
if
scattered
by
a
volley
of
hearing
the
racket
the
rest
of
the
maids
came
running
anita
and
maria
the
twins
women
forty
years
old
born
on
the
place
the
year
after
general
moreno
brought
home
his
handsome
young
bride
their
two
daughters
rosa
and
anita
the
little
as
she
was
still
called
though
she
outweighed
her
mother
old
juanita
the
oldest
woman
in
the
household
of
whom
even
the
senora
was
said
not
to
know
the
exact
age
or
history
and
she
poor
thing
could
tell
nothing
having
been
silly
for
ten
years
or
more
good
for
nothing
except
to
shell
beans
that
she
did
as
fast
and
well
as
ever
and
was
never
happy
except
she
was
at
it
luckily
for
her
beans
are
the
one
crop
never
omitted
or
stinted
on
a
mexican
estate
and
for
sake
of
old
juanita
they
stored
every
year
in
the
moreno
house
rooms
full
of
beans
in
the
pod
tons
of
them
one
would
think
enough
to
feed
an
army
but
then
it
was
like
a
little
army
even
now
the
senora
household
nobody
ever
knew
exactly
how
many
women
were
in
the
kitchen
or
how
many
men
in
the
fields
there
were
always
women
cousins
or
brother
wives
or
widows
or
daughters
who
had
come
to
stay
or
men
cousins
or
husbands
or
sons
who
were
stopping
on
their
way
up
or
down
the
valley
when
it
came
to
the
senor
felipe
knew
to
whom
he
paid
wages
but
who
were
fed
and
lodged
under
his
roof
that
was
quite
another
thing
it
could
not
enter
into
the
head
of
a
mexican
gentleman
to
make
either
count
or
account
of
that
it
would
be
a
disgraceful
niggardly
thought
to
the
senora
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
no
longer
any
people
about
the
place
a
beggarly
handful
she
would
have
said
hardly
enough
to
do
the
work
of
the
house
or
of
the
estate
sadly
as
the
latter
had
dwindled
in
the
general
day
it
had
been
a
boast
of
his
that
never
less
than
fifty
persons
men
women
and
children
were
fed
within
his
gates
each
day
how
many
more
he
did
not
care
nor
know
but
that
time
had
indeed
gone
gone
forever
and
though
a
stranger
seeing
the
sudden
rush
and
muster
at
door
and
window
which
followed
on
old
letting
fly
the
water
at
juan
head
would
have
thought
good
heavens
do
all
those
women
children
and
babies
belong
in
that
one
house
the
senora
sole
thought
as
she
at
that
moment
went
past
the
gate
was
poor
things
how
few
there
are
left
of
them
i
am
afraid
old
marda
has
to
work
too
hard
i
must
spare
margarita
more
from
the
house
to
help
and
she
sighed
deeply
and
unconsciously
held
her
rosary
nearer
to
her
heart
as
she
went
into
the
house
and
entered
her
son
bedroom
the
picture
she
saw
there
was
one
to
thrill
any
mother
heart
and
as
it
met
her
eye
she
paused
on
the
threshold
for
a
second
only
a
second
however
and
nothing
could
have
astonished
felipe
moreno
so
much
as
to
have
been
told
that
at
the
very
moment
when
his
mother
calm
voice
was
saying
to
him
good
morning
my
son
i
hope
you
have
slept
well
and
are
better
there
was
welling
up
in
her
heart
a
passionate
ejaculation
o
my
glorious
son
the
saints
have
sent
me
in
him
the
face
of
his
father
he
is
fit
for
a
kingdom
the
truth
is
felipe
moreno
was
not
fit
for
a
kingdom
at
all
if
he
had
been
he
would
not
have
been
so
ruled
by
his
mother
without
ever
finding
it
out
but
so
far
as
mere
physical
beauty
goes
there
never
was
a
king
born
whose
face
stature
and
bearing
would
set
off
a
crown
or
a
throne
or
any
of
the
things
of
which
the
outside
of
royalty
is
made
up
better
than
would
felipe
moreno
and
it
was
true
as
the
senora
said
whether
the
saints
had
anything
to
do
with
it
or
not
that
he
had
the
face
of
his
father
so
strong
a
likeness
is
seldom
seen
when
felipe
once
on
the
occasion
of
a
grand
celebration
and
procession
put
on
the
velvet
mantle
gayly
embroidered
short
breeches
fastened
at
the
knee
with
red
ribbons
and
sombrero
which
his
father
had
worn
years
before
the
senora
fainted
at
her
first
look
at
him
fainted
and
fell
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
the
same
splendid
gayly
arrayed
man
bending
over
her
in
distress
with
words
of
endearment
and
alarm
she
fainted
again
mother
mother
mia
cried
felipe
i
will
not
wear
them
if
it
makes
you
feel
like
this
let
me
take
them
off
i
will
not
go
to
their
cursed
parade
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
with
trembling
fingers
to
unbuckle
the
no
no
felipe
faintly
cried
the
senora
from
the
ground
it
is
my
wish
that
you
wear
them
and
staggering
to
her
feet
with
a
burst
of
tears
she
rebuckled
the
old
which
her
fingers
had
so
many
times
never
unkissed
buckled
in
the
days
when
her
husband
had
bade
her
farewell
and
gone
forth
to
the
uncertain
fates
of
war
wear
them
she
cried
with
gathering
fire
in
her
tones
and
her
eyes
dry
of
tears
wear
them
and
let
the
american
hounds
see
what
a
mexican
officer
and
gentleman
looked
like
before
they
had
set
their
base
usurping
feet
on
our
necks
and
she
followed
him
to
the
gate
and
stood
erect
bravely
waving
her
handkerchief
as
he
galloped
off
till
he
was
out
of
sight
then
with
a
changed
face
and
a
bent
head
she
crept
slowly
to
her
room
locked
herself
in
fell
on
her
knees
before
the
madonna
at
the
head
of
her
bed
and
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
day
praying
that
she
might
be
forgiven
and
that
all
heretics
might
be
discomfited
from
which
part
of
these
supplications
she
derived
most
comfort
is
easy
to
imagine
juan
canito
had
been
right
in
his
sudden
surmise
that
it
was
for
father
salvierderra
coming
that
the
was
being
delayed
and
not
in
consequence
of
senor
felipe
illness
or
by
the
of
luigo
and
his
flock
of
sheep
juan
would
have
chuckled
to
himself
still
more
at
his
perspicacity
had
he
overheard
the
conversation
going
on
between
the
senora
and
her
son
at
the
very
time
when
he
half
asleep
on
the
veranda
was
as
he
would
have
called
it
putting
two
and
two
together
and
convincing
himself
that
old
juan
was
as
smart
as
they
were
and
not
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
by
all
their
reticence
and
equivocation
juan
can
is
growing
very
impatient
about
the
said
the
senora
i
suppose
you
are
still
of
the
same
mind
about
it
felipe
that
it
is
better
to
wait
till
father
salvierderra
comes
as
the
only
chance
those
indians
have
of
seeing
him
is
here
it
would
seem
a
christian
duty
to
so
arrange
it
if
it
be
possible
but
juan
is
very
restive
he
is
getting
old
and
chafes
a
little
i
fancy
under
your
control
he
can
not
forget
that
you
were
a
boy
on
his
knee
now
i
for
my
part
am
like
to
forget
that
you
were
ever
anything
but
a
man
for
me
to
lean
felipe
turned
his
handsome
face
toward
his
mother
with
a
beaming
smile
of
filial
affection
and
gratified
manly
vanity
indeed
my
mother
if
i
can
be
sufficient
for
you
to
lean
on
i
will
ask
nothing
more
of
the
saints
and
he
took
his
mother
thin
and
wasted
little
hands
both
at
once
in
his
own
strong
right
hand
and
carried
them
to
his
lips
as
a
lover
might
have
done
you
will
spoil
me
mother
he
said
you
make
me
so
no
felipe
it
is
i
who
am
proud
promptly
replied
the
mother
and
i
do
not
call
it
being
proud
only
grateful
to
god
for
having
given
me
a
son
wise
enough
to
take
his
father
place
and
guide
and
protect
me
through
the
few
remaining
years
i
have
to
live
i
shall
die
content
seeing
you
at
the
head
of
the
estate
and
living
as
a
mexican
gentleman
should
that
is
so
far
as
now
remains
possible
in
this
unfortunate
country
but
about
the
felipe
do
you
wish
to
have
it
begun
before
the
father
is
here
of
course
alessandro
is
all
ready
with
his
band
it
is
but
two
days
journey
for
a
messenger
to
bring
him
father
salvierderra
can
not
be
here
before
the
of
the
month
he
leaves
santa
barbara
on
the
and
he
will
walk
all
the
way
a
good
six
days
journey
for
he
is
old
now
and
feeble
then
he
must
stop
in
ventura
for
a
sunday
and
a
day
at
the
ortega
ranch
and
at
the
lopez
there
there
is
a
christening
yes
the
is
the
very
earliest
that
he
can
be
here
near
two
weeks
from
now
so
far
as
your
getting
up
is
concerned
it
might
perhaps
be
next
week
you
will
be
nearly
well
by
that
yes
indeed
laughed
felipe
stretching
himself
out
in
the
bed
and
giving
a
kick
to
the
bedclothes
that
made
the
high
bedposts
and
the
fringed
canopy
roof
shake
and
creak
i
am
well
now
if
it
were
not
for
this
cursed
weakness
when
i
stand
on
my
feet
i
believe
it
would
do
me
good
to
get
out
of
in
truth
felipe
had
been
hankering
for
the
himself
it
was
a
brisk
busy
holiday
sort
of
time
to
him
hard
as
he
worked
in
it
and
two
weeks
looked
long
to
wait
it
is
always
thus
after
a
fever
said
his
mother
the
weakness
lasts
many
weeks
i
am
not
sure
that
you
will
be
strong
enough
even
in
two
weeks
to
do
the
packing
but
as
juan
can
said
this
morning
he
stood
at
the
when
you
were
a
boy
and
there
was
no
need
of
waiting
for
you
for
that
he
said
that
did
he
exclaimed
felipe
wrathfully
the
old
man
is
getting
insolent
i
tell
him
that
nobody
will
pack
the
sacks
but
myself
while
i
am
master
here
and
i
will
have
the
when
i
please
and
not
i
suppose
it
would
not
be
wise
to
say
that
it
is
not
to
take
place
till
the
father
comes
would
it
asked
the
senora
hesitatingly
as
if
the
thing
were
evenly
balanced
in
her
mind
the
father
has
not
that
hold
on
the
younger
men
he
used
to
have
and
i
have
thought
that
even
in
juan
himself
i
have
detected
a
remissness
the
spirit
of
unbelief
is
spreading
in
the
country
since
the
americans
are
running
up
and
down
everywhere
seeking
money
like
dogs
with
their
noses
to
the
ground
it
might
vex
juan
if
he
knew
that
you
were
waiting
only
for
the
father
what
do
you
think
i
think
it
is
enough
for
him
to
know
that
the
waits
for
my
pleasure
answered
felipe
still
wrathful
and
that
is
the
end
of
and
so
it
was
and
moreover
precisely
the
end
which
senora
moreno
had
had
in
her
own
mind
from
the
beginning
but
not
even
juan
canito
himself
suspected
its
being
solely
her
purpose
and
not
her
son
as
for
felipe
if
any
person
had
suggested
to
him
that
it
was
his
mother
and
not
he
who
had
decided
that
the
would
be
better
deferred
until
the
arrival
of
father
salvierderra
from
santa
barbara
and
that
nothing
should
be
said
on
the
ranch
about
this
being
the
real
reason
of
the
postponing
felipe
would
have
stared
in
astonishment
and
have
thought
that
person
either
crazy
or
a
fool
to
attain
one
ends
in
this
way
is
the
consummate
triumph
of
art
never
to
appear
as
a
factor
in
the
situation
to
be
able
to
wield
other
men
as
instruments
with
the
same
direct
and
implicit
response
to
will
that
one
gets
from
a
hand
or
a
foot
this
is
to
triumph
indeed
to
be
as
nearly
controller
and
conqueror
of
fates
as
fate
permits
there
have
been
men
prominent
in
the
world
affairs
at
one
time
and
another
who
have
sought
and
studied
such
a
power
and
have
acquired
it
to
a
great
degree
by
it
they
have
manipulated
legislators
ambassadors
sovereigns
and
have
grasped
held
and
played
with
the
destinies
of
empires
but
it
is
to
be
questioned
whether
even
in
these
notable
instances
there
has
ever
been
such
marvellous
completeness
of
success
as
is
sometimes
seen
in
the
case
of
a
woman
in
whom
the
power
is
an
instinct
and
not
an
attainment
a
passion
rather
than
a
purpose
between
the
two
results
between
the
two
processes
there
is
just
that
difference
which
is
always
to
be
seen
between
the
stroke
of
talent
and
the
stroke
of
genius
senora
moreno
was
the
stroke
of
genius
ii
the
senora
moreno
house
was
one
of
the
best
specimens
to
be
found
in
california
of
the
representative
house
of
the
half
barbaric
half
elegant
wholly
generous
and
life
led
there
by
mexican
men
and
women
of
degree
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
under
the
rule
of
the
spanish
and
mexican
viceroys
when
the
laws
of
the
indies
were
still
the
law
of
the
land
and
its
old
name
new
spain
was
an
link
and
stimulus
to
the
warmest
memories
and
deepest
patriotisms
of
its
people
it
was
a
picturesque
life
with
more
of
sentiment
and
gayety
in
it
more
also
that
was
truly
dramatic
more
romance
than
will
ever
be
seen
again
on
those
sunny
shores
the
aroma
of
it
all
lingers
there
still
industries
and
inventions
have
not
yet
slain
it
it
will
last
out
its
century
in
fact
it
can
never
be
quite
lost
so
long
as
there
is
left
standing
one
such
house
as
the
senora
moreno
when
the
house
was
built
general
moreno
owned
all
the
land
within
a
radius
of
forty
miles
forty
miles
westward
down
the
valley
to
the
sea
forty
miles
eastward
into
the
san
fernando
mountains
and
good
forty
miles
more
or
less
along
the
coast
the
boundaries
were
not
very
strictly
defined
there
was
no
occasion
in
those
happy
days
to
reckon
land
by
inches
it
might
be
asked
perhaps
just
how
general
moreno
owned
all
this
land
and
the
question
might
not
be
easy
to
answer
it
was
not
and
could
not
be
answered
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
united
states
land
commission
which
after
the
surrender
of
california
undertook
to
sift
and
adjust
mexican
land
titles
and
that
was
the
way
it
had
come
about
that
the
senora
moreno
now
called
herself
a
poor
woman
tract
after
tract
her
lands
had
been
taken
away
from
her
it
looked
for
a
time
as
if
nothing
would
be
left
every
one
of
the
claims
based
on
deeds
of
gift
from
governor
pio
fico
her
husband
most
intimate
friend
was
disallowed
they
all
went
by
the
board
in
one
batch
and
took
away
from
the
senora
in
a
day
the
greater
part
of
her
best
they
were
lands
which
had
belonged
to
the
bonaventura
mission
and
lay
along
the
coast
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
down
which
the
little
stream
which
ran
past
her
house
went
to
the
sea
and
it
had
been
a
great
pride
and
delight
to
the
senora
when
she
was
young
to
ride
that
forty
miles
by
her
husband
side
all
the
way
on
their
own
lands
straight
from
their
house
to
their
own
strip
of
shore
no
wonder
she
believed
the
americans
thieves
and
spoke
of
them
always
as
hounds
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
never
in
the
least
realized
that
the
taking
possession
of
california
was
not
only
a
conquering
of
mexico
but
a
conquering
of
california
as
well
that
the
real
bitterness
of
the
surrender
was
not
so
much
to
the
empire
which
gave
up
the
country
as
to
the
country
itself
which
was
given
up
provinces
passed
back
and
forth
in
that
way
helpless
in
the
hands
of
great
powers
have
all
the
ignominy
and
humiliation
of
defeat
with
none
of
the
dignities
or
compensations
of
the
transaction
mexico
saved
much
by
her
treaty
spite
of
having
to
acknowledge
herself
beaten
but
california
lost
all
words
can
not
tell
the
sting
of
such
a
transfer
it
is
a
marvel
that
a
mexican
remained
in
the
country
probably
none
did
except
those
who
were
absolutely
forced
to
it
luckily
for
the
senora
moreno
her
title
to
the
lands
midway
in
the
valley
was
better
than
to
those
lying
to
the
east
and
the
west
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
missions
of
san
fernando
and
bonaventura
and
after
all
the
claims
petitions
appeals
and
adjudications
were
ended
she
still
was
left
in
undisputed
possession
of
what
would
have
been
thought
by
any
into
the
country
to
be
a
handsome
estate
but
which
seemed
to
the
despoiled
and
indignant
senora
a
pitiful
fragment
of
one
moreover
she
declared
that
she
should
never
feel
secure
of
a
foot
of
even
this
any
day
she
said
the
united
states
government
might
send
out
a
new
land
commission
to
examine
the
decrees
of
the
first
and
revoke
such
as
they
saw
fit
once
a
thief
always
a
thief
nobody
need
feel
himself
safe
under
american
rule
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
any
day
and
year
by
year
the
lines
of
sadness
resentment
anxiety
and
antagonism
deepened
on
the
fast
aging
face
it
gave
her
unspeakable
satisfaction
when
the
commissioners
laying
out
a
road
down
the
valley
ran
it
at
the
back
of
her
house
instead
of
past
the
front
it
is
well
she
said
let
their
travel
be
where
it
belongs
behind
our
kitchens
and
no
one
have
sight
of
the
front
doors
of
our
houses
except
friends
who
have
come
to
visit
her
enjoyment
of
this
never
flagged
whenever
she
saw
passing
the
place
wagons
or
carriages
belonging
to
the
hated
americans
it
gave
her
a
distinct
thrill
of
pleasure
to
think
that
the
house
turned
its
back
on
them
she
would
like
always
to
be
able
to
do
the
same
herself
but
whatever
she
by
policy
or
in
business
might
be
forced
to
do
the
old
house
at
any
rate
would
always
keep
the
attitude
of
contempt
its
face
turned
away
one
other
pleasure
she
provided
herself
with
soon
after
this
road
was
opened
a
pleasure
in
which
religious
devotion
and
race
antagonism
were
so
closely
blended
that
it
would
have
puzzled
the
subtlest
of
priests
to
decide
whether
her
act
were
a
sin
or
a
virtue
she
caused
to
be
set
up
upon
every
one
of
the
soft
rounded
hills
which
made
the
beautiful
rolling
sides
of
that
part
of
the
valley
a
large
wooden
cross
not
a
hill
in
sight
of
her
house
left
without
the
sacred
emblem
of
her
faith
that
the
heretics
may
know
when
they
go
by
that
they
are
on
the
estate
of
a
good
catholic
she
said
and
that
the
faithful
may
be
reminded
to
pray
there
have
been
miracles
of
conversion
wrought
on
the
most
hardened
by
a
sudden
sight
of
the
blessed
there
they
stood
summer
and
winter
rain
and
shine
the
silent
solemn
outstretched
arms
and
became
landmarks
to
many
a
guideless
traveller
who
had
been
told
that
his
way
would
be
by
the
first
turn
to
the
left
or
the
right
after
passing
the
last
one
of
the
senora
moreno
crosses
which
he
could
miss
seeing
and
who
shall
say
that
it
did
not
often
happen
that
the
crosses
bore
a
sudden
message
to
some
idle
heart
journeying
by
and
thus
justified
the
pious
half
of
the
impulse
certain
it
is
that
many
a
good
catholic
halted
and
crossed
himself
when
he
first
beheld
them
in
the
lonely
places
standing
out
in
sudden
relief
against
the
blue
sky
and
if
he
said
a
swift
short
prayer
at
the
sight
was
he
not
so
much
the
better
the
house
was
of
adobe
low
with
a
wide
veranda
on
the
three
sides
of
the
inner
court
and
a
still
broader
one
across
the
entire
front
which
looked
to
the
south
these
verandas
especially
those
on
the
inner
court
were
supplementary
rooms
to
the
house
the
greater
part
of
the
family
life
went
on
in
them
nobody
stayed
inside
the
walls
except
when
it
was
necessary
all
the
kitchen
work
except
the
actual
cooking
was
done
here
in
front
of
the
kitchen
doors
and
windows
babies
slept
were
washed
sat
in
the
dirt
and
played
on
the
veranda
the
women
said
their
prayers
took
their
naps
and
wove
their
lace
there
old
juanita
shelled
her
beans
there
and
threw
the
pods
down
on
the
tile
floor
till
towards
night
they
were
sometimes
piled
up
high
around
her
like
at
a
husking
the
herdsmen
and
shepherds
smoked
there
lounged
there
trained
their
dogs
there
there
the
young
made
love
and
the
old
dozed
the
benches
which
ran
the
entire
length
of
the
walls
were
worn
into
hollows
and
shone
like
satin
the
tiled
floors
also
were
broken
and
sunk
in
places
making
little
wells
which
filled
up
in
times
of
hard
rains
and
were
then
an
invaluable
addition
to
the
resources
for
amusement
and
also
to
the
comfort
of
the
dogs
cats
and
fowls
who
picked
about
among
them
taking
sips
from
each
the
arched
veranda
along
the
front
was
a
delightsome
place
it
must
have
been
eighty
feet
long
at
least
for
the
doors
of
five
large
rooms
opened
on
it
the
two
westernmost
rooms
had
been
added
on
and
made
four
steps
higher
than
the
others
which
gave
to
that
end
of
the
veranda
the
look
of
a
balcony
or
loggia
here
the
senora
kept
her
flowers
great
red
by
the
indians
of
san
luis
obispo
mission
stood
in
close
rows
against
the
walls
and
in
them
were
always
growing
fine
geraniums
carnations
and
musk
the
passion
for
musk
she
had
inherited
from
her
mother
it
was
so
strong
that
she
sometimes
wondered
at
it
and
one
day
as
she
sat
with
father
salvierderra
in
the
veranda
she
picked
a
handful
of
the
blossoms
and
giving
them
to
him
said
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
but
it
seems
to
me
if
i
were
dead
i
could
be
brought
to
life
by
the
smell
of
it
is
in
your
blood
senora
the
old
monk
replied
when
i
was
last
in
your
father
house
in
seville
your
mother
sent
for
me
to
her
room
and
under
her
window
was
a
stone
balcony
full
of
growing
musk
which
so
filled
the
room
with
its
odor
that
i
was
like
to
faint
but
she
said
it
cured
her
of
diseases
and
without
it
she
fell
you
were
a
baby
yes
cried
the
senora
but
i
recollect
that
balcony
i
recollect
being
lifted
up
to
a
window
and
looking
down
into
a
bed
of
blooming
yellow
flowers
but
i
did
not
know
what
they
were
how
strange
no
not
strange
daughter
replied
father
salvierderra
it
would
have
been
stranger
if
you
had
not
acquired
the
taste
thus
drawing
it
in
with
the
mother
milk
it
would
behoove
mothers
to
remember
this
far
more
than
they
besides
the
geraniums
and
carnations
and
musk
in
the
red
jars
there
were
many
sorts
of
climbing
vines
some
coming
from
the
ground
and
twining
around
the
pillars
of
the
veranda
some
growing
in
great
bowls
swung
by
cords
from
the
roof
of
the
veranda
or
set
on
shelves
against
the
walls
these
bowls
were
of
gray
stone
hollowed
and
polished
shining
smooth
inside
and
out
they
also
had
been
made
by
the
indians
nobody
knew
how
many
ages
ago
scooped
and
polished
by
the
patient
creatures
with
only
stones
for
tools
among
these
vines
singing
from
morning
till
night
hung
the
senora
canaries
and
finches
half
a
dozen
of
each
all
of
different
generations
raised
by
the
senora
she
was
never
without
a
young
on
hand
and
all
the
way
from
bonaventura
to
monterey
it
was
thought
a
piece
of
good
luck
to
come
into
possession
of
a
canary
or
finch
of
senora
moreno
between
the
veranda
and
the
river
meadows
out
on
which
it
looked
all
was
garden
orange
grove
and
almond
orchard
the
orange
grove
always
green
never
without
snowy
bloom
or
golden
fruit
the
garden
never
without
flowers
summer
or
winter
and
the
almond
orchard
in
early
spring
a
fluttering
canopy
of
pink
and
white
petals
which
seen
from
the
hills
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
looked
as
if
rosy
sunrise
clouds
had
fallen
and
become
tangled
in
the
on
either
hand
stretched
away
other
orchards
peach
apricot
pear
apple
pomegranate
and
beyond
these
vineyards
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
verdure
or
bloom
or
fruit
at
whatever
time
of
year
you
sat
on
the
senora
south
veranda
a
wide
straight
walk
shaded
by
a
trellis
so
knotted
and
twisted
with
grapevines
that
little
was
to
be
seen
of
the
trellis
led
straight
down
from
the
veranda
steps
through
the
middle
of
the
garden
to
a
little
brook
at
the
foot
of
it
across
this
brook
in
the
shade
of
a
dozen
gnarled
old
were
set
the
broad
flat
stone
washboards
on
which
was
done
all
the
family
washing
no
long
dawdling
and
no
running
away
from
work
on
the
part
of
the
maids
thus
close
to
the
eye
of
the
senora
at
the
upper
end
of
the
garden
and
if
they
had
known
how
picturesque
they
looked
there
kneeling
on
the
grass
lifting
the
dripping
linen
out
of
the
water
rubbing
it
back
and
forth
on
the
stones
sousing
it
wringing
it
splashing
the
clear
water
in
each
other
faces
they
would
have
been
content
to
stay
at
the
washing
day
in
and
day
out
for
there
was
always
somebody
to
look
on
from
above
hardly
a
day
passed
that
the
senora
had
not
visitors
she
was
still
a
person
of
note
her
house
the
natural
for
all
who
journeyed
through
the
valley
and
whoever
came
spent
all
of
his
time
when
not
eating
sleeping
or
walking
over
the
place
sitting
with
the
senora
on
the
sunny
veranda
few
days
in
winter
were
cold
enough
and
in
summer
the
day
must
be
hot
indeed
to
drive
the
senora
and
her
friends
indoors
there
stood
on
the
veranda
three
carved
oaken
chairs
and
a
carved
bench
also
of
oak
which
had
been
brought
to
the
senora
for
safe
keeping
by
the
faithful
old
sacristan
of
san
luis
rey
at
the
time
of
the
occupation
of
that
mission
by
the
united
states
troops
soon
after
the
conquest
of
california
aghast
at
the
sacrilegious
acts
of
the
soldiers
who
were
quartered
in
the
very
church
itself
and
amused
themselves
by
making
targets
of
the
eyes
and
noses
of
the
statues
the
sacristan
stealthily
day
by
day
and
night
after
night
bore
out
of
the
church
all
that
he
dared
to
remove
burying
some
articles
in
cottonwood
copses
hiding
others
in
his
own
poor
little
hovel
until
he
had
of
sacred
treasures
then
still
more
stealthily
he
carried
them
a
few
at
a
time
concealed
in
the
bottom
of
a
cart
under
a
load
of
hay
or
of
brush
to
the
house
of
the
senora
who
felt
herself
deeply
honored
by
his
confidence
and
received
everything
as
a
sacred
trust
to
be
given
back
into
the
hands
of
the
church
again
whenever
the
missions
should
be
restored
of
which
at
that
time
all
catholics
had
good
hope
and
so
it
had
come
about
that
no
bedroom
in
the
senora
house
was
without
a
picture
or
a
statue
of
a
saint
or
of
the
madonna
and
some
had
two
and
in
the
little
chapel
in
the
garden
the
altar
was
surrounded
by
a
really
imposing
row
of
holy
and
apostolic
figures
which
had
looked
down
on
the
splendid
ceremonies
of
the
san
luis
rey
mission
in
father
peyri
time
no
more
benignly
than
they
now
did
on
the
humbler
worship
of
the
senora
family
in
its
diminished
estate
that
one
had
lost
an
eye
another
an
arm
that
the
once
brilliant
colors
of
the
drapery
were
now
faded
and
shabby
only
enhanced
the
tender
reverence
with
which
the
senora
knelt
before
them
her
eyes
filling
with
indignant
tears
at
thought
of
the
heretic
hands
which
had
wrought
such
defilement
even
the
crumbling
wreaths
which
had
been
placed
on
some
of
the
statues
heads
at
the
time
of
the
last
ceremonial
at
which
they
had
figured
in
the
mission
had
been
brought
away
with
them
by
the
devout
sacristan
and
the
senora
had
replaced
each
one
holding
it
only
a
degree
less
sacred
than
the
statue
itself
this
chapel
was
dearer
to
the
senora
than
her
house
it
had
been
built
by
the
general
in
the
second
year
of
their
married
life
in
it
her
four
children
had
been
christened
and
from
it
all
but
one
her
handsome
felipe
had
been
buried
while
they
were
yet
infants
in
the
time
while
the
estate
was
at
its
best
and
hundreds
of
indians
living
within
its
borders
there
was
many
a
sunday
when
the
scene
to
be
witnessed
there
was
like
the
scenes
at
the
missions
the
chapel
full
of
kneeling
men
and
women
those
who
could
not
find
room
inside
kneeling
on
the
garden
walks
outside
father
salvierderra
in
gorgeous
vestments
coming
at
close
of
the
services
slowly
down
the
aisle
the
rows
of
worshippers
parting
to
right
and
left
to
let
him
through
all
looking
up
eagerly
for
his
blessing
women
giving
him
offerings
of
fruit
or
flowers
and
holding
up
their
babies
that
he
might
lay
his
hands
on
their
heads
no
one
but
father
salvierderra
had
ever
officiated
in
the
moreno
chapel
or
heard
the
confession
of
a
moreno
he
was
a
franciscan
one
of
the
few
now
left
in
the
country
so
revered
and
beloved
by
all
who
had
come
under
his
influence
that
they
would
wait
long
months
without
the
offices
of
the
church
rather
than
confess
their
sins
or
confide
their
perplexities
to
any
one
else
from
this
attachment
on
the
part
of
the
indians
and
the
older
mexican
families
in
the
country
to
the
franciscan
order
there
had
grown
up
not
unnaturally
some
jealousy
of
them
in
the
minds
of
the
secular
priests
and
the
position
of
the
few
monks
left
was
not
wholly
a
pleasant
one
it
had
even
been
rumored
that
they
were
to
be
forbidden
to
continue
longer
their
practice
of
going
up
and
down
the
country
ministering
everywhere
were
to
be
compelled
to
restrict
their
labors
to
their
own
colleges
at
santa
barbara
and
santa
inez
when
something
to
this
effect
was
one
day
said
in
the
senora
moreno
presence
two
scarlet
spots
sprang
on
her
cheeks
and
before
she
bethought
herself
she
exclaimed
that
day
i
burn
down
my
chapel
luckily
nobody
but
felipe
heard
the
rash
threat
and
his
exclamation
of
unbounded
astonishment
recalled
the
senora
to
herself
i
spoke
rashly
my
son
she
said
the
church
is
to
be
obeyed
always
but
the
franciscan
fathers
are
responsible
to
no
one
but
the
superior
of
their
own
order
and
there
is
no
one
in
this
land
who
has
the
authority
to
forbid
their
journeying
and
ministering
to
whoever
desires
their
offices
as
for
these
catalan
priests
who
are
coming
in
here
i
can
not
abide
them
no
catalan
but
has
bad
blood
in
his
veins
there
was
every
reason
in
the
world
why
the
senora
should
be
thus
warmly
attached
to
the
franciscan
order
from
her
earliest
recollections
the
gray
gown
and
cowl
had
been
familiar
to
her
eyes
and
had
represented
the
things
which
she
was
taught
to
hold
most
sacred
and
dear
father
salvierderra
himself
had
come
from
mexico
to
monterey
in
the
same
ship
which
had
brought
her
father
to
be
the
commandante
of
the
santa
barbara
presidio
and
her
uncle
her
father
eldest
brother
was
at
that
time
the
superior
of
the
santa
barbara
mission
the
sentiment
and
romance
of
her
youth
were
almost
equally
divided
between
the
gayeties
excitements
adornments
of
the
life
at
the
presidio
and
the
ceremonies
and
devotions
of
the
life
at
the
mission
she
was
famed
as
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
country
men
of
the
army
men
of
the
navy
and
men
of
the
church
alike
adored
her
her
name
was
a
toast
from
monterey
to
san
diego
when
at
last
she
was
wooed
and
won
by
felipe
moreno
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
mexican
generals
her
wedding
ceremonies
were
the
most
splendid
ever
seen
in
the
country
the
right
tower
of
the
mission
church
at
santa
barbara
had
been
just
completed
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
consecration
of
this
tower
should
take
place
at
the
time
of
her
wedding
and
that
her
wedding
feast
should
be
spread
in
the
long
outside
corridor
of
the
mission
building
the
whole
country
far
and
near
was
bid
the
feast
lasted
three
days
open
tables
to
everybody
singing
dancing
eating
drinking
and
making
merry
at
that
time
there
were
long
streets
of
indian
houses
stretching
eastward
from
the
mission
before
each
of
these
houses
was
built
a
booth
of
green
boughs
the
indians
as
well
as
the
fathers
from
all
the
other
missions
were
invited
to
come
the
indians
came
in
bands
singing
songs
and
bringing
gifts
as
they
appeared
the
santa
barbara
indians
went
out
to
meet
them
also
singing
bearing
gifts
and
strewing
seeds
on
the
ground
in
token
of
welcome
the
young
senora
and
her
bridegroom
splendidly
clothed
were
seen
of
all
and
greeted
whenever
they
appeared
by
showers
of
seeds
and
grains
and
blossoms
on
the
third
day
still
in
their
wedding
attire
and
bearing
lighted
candles
in
their
hands
they
walked
with
the
monks
in
a
procession
round
and
round
the
new
tower
the
monks
chanting
and
sprinkling
incense
and
holy
water
on
its
walls
the
ceremony
seeming
to
all
devout
beholders
to
give
a
blessed
consecration
to
the
union
of
the
young
pair
as
well
as
to
the
newly
completed
tower
after
this
they
journeyed
in
state
accompanied
by
several
of
the
general
aids
and
officers
and
by
two
franciscan
fathers
up
to
monterey
stopping
on
their
way
at
all
the
missions
and
being
warmly
welcomed
and
entertained
at
each
general
moreno
was
much
beloved
by
both
army
and
church
in
many
of
the
frequent
clashings
between
the
military
and
the
ecclesiastical
powers
he
being
as
devout
and
enthusiastic
a
catholic
as
he
was
zealous
and
enthusiastic
a
soldier
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
of
material
assistance
to
each
party
the
indians
also
knew
his
name
well
having
heard
it
many
times
mentioned
with
public
thanksgivings
in
the
mission
churches
after
some
signal
service
he
had
rendered
to
the
fathers
either
in
mexico
or
monterey
and
now
by
taking
as
his
bride
the
daughter
of
a
distinguished
officer
and
the
niece
of
the
santa
barbara
superior
he
had
linked
himself
anew
to
the
two
dominant
powers
and
interests
of
the
country
when
they
reached
san
luis
obispo
the
whole
indian
population
turned
out
to
meet
them
the
padre
walking
at
the
head
as
they
approached
the
mission
doors
the
indians
swarmed
closer
and
closer
and
still
closer
took
the
general
horse
by
the
head
and
finally
almost
by
actual
force
compelled
him
to
allow
himself
to
be
lifted
into
a
blanket
held
high
up
by
twenty
strong
men
and
thus
he
was
borne
up
the
steps
across
the
corridor
and
into
the
padre
room
it
was
a
position
ludicrously
undignified
in
itself
but
the
general
submitted
to
it
oh
let
them
do
it
if
they
like
he
cried
laughingly
to
padre
martinez
who
was
endeavoring
to
quiet
the
indians
and
hold
them
back
let
them
do
it
it
pleases
the
poor
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
the
good
padre
having
exhausted
all
his
resources
for
entertaining
his
distinguished
guests
caused
to
be
driven
past
the
corridors
for
their
inspection
all
the
poultry
belonging
to
the
mission
the
procession
took
an
hour
to
pass
for
music
there
was
the
squeaking
cackling
hissing
gobbling
crowing
quacking
of
the
fowls
combined
with
the
screaming
scolding
and
of
the
excited
indian
marshals
of
the
lines
first
came
the
turkeys
then
the
roosters
then
the
white
hens
then
the
black
and
then
the
yellow
next
the
ducks
and
at
the
tail
of
the
spectacle
long
files
of
geese
some
strutting
some
half
flying
and
hissing
in
resentment
and
terror
at
the
unwonted
coercions
to
which
they
were
subjected
the
indians
had
been
hard
at
work
all
night
capturing
sorting
assorting
and
guarding
the
rank
and
file
of
their
novel
pageant
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
a
droller
sight
never
was
seen
and
never
will
be
on
the
pacific
coast
or
any
other
before
it
was
done
with
the
general
and
his
bride
had
nearly
died
with
laughter
and
the
general
could
never
allude
to
it
without
laughing
almost
as
heartily
again
at
monterey
they
were
more
magnificently
feted
at
the
presidio
at
the
mission
on
board
spanish
mexican
and
russian
ships
lying
in
harbor
balls
dances
dinners
all
that
the
country
knew
of
festivity
was
lavished
on
the
beautiful
and
winning
young
bride
the
belles
of
the
coast
from
san
diego
up
had
all
gathered
at
monterey
for
these
gayeties
but
not
one
of
them
could
be
for
a
moment
compared
to
her
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
senora
life
as
a
married
woman
she
was
then
just
twenty
a
close
observer
would
have
seen
even
then
underneath
the
joyous
smile
the
laughing
eye
the
merry
voice
a
look
thoughtful
tender
earnest
at
times
enthusiastic
this
look
was
the
reflection
of
those
qualities
in
her
then
hardly
aroused
which
made
her
as
years
developed
her
character
and
stormy
fates
thickened
around
her
life
the
unflinching
comrade
of
her
soldier
husband
the
passionate
adherent
of
the
church
through
wars
insurrections
revolutions
downfalls
spanish
mexican
civil
ecclesiastical
her
standpoint
her
poise
remained
the
same
she
simply
grew
more
and
more
proudly
passionately
a
spaniard
and
a
moreno
more
and
more
stanchly
and
fierily
a
catholic
and
a
lover
of
the
franciscans
during
the
height
of
the
despoiling
and
plundering
of
the
missions
under
the
secularization
act
she
was
for
a
few
years
almost
beside
herself
more
than
once
she
journeyed
alone
when
the
journey
was
by
no
means
without
danger
to
monterey
to
stir
up
the
prefect
of
the
missions
to
more
energetic
action
to
implore
the
governmental
authorities
to
interfere
and
protect
the
church
property
it
was
largely
in
consequence
of
her
eloquent
entreaties
that
governor
micheltorena
issued
his
bootless
order
restoring
to
the
church
all
the
missions
south
of
san
luis
obispo
but
this
order
cost
micheltorena
his
political
head
and
general
moreno
was
severely
wounded
in
one
of
the
skirmishes
of
the
insurrection
which
drove
micheltorena
out
of
the
country
in
silence
and
bitter
humiliation
the
senora
nursed
her
husband
back
to
health
again
and
resolved
to
meddle
no
more
in
the
affairs
of
her
unhappy
country
and
still
more
unhappy
church
as
year
by
year
she
saw
the
ruin
of
the
missions
steadily
going
on
their
vast
properties
melting
away
like
dew
before
the
sun
in
the
hands
of
dishonest
administrators
and
politicians
the
church
powerless
to
contend
with
the
unprincipled
greed
in
high
places
her
beloved
franciscan
fathers
driven
from
the
country
or
dying
of
starvation
at
their
posts
she
submitted
herself
to
what
she
was
forced
to
admit
seemed
to
be
the
inscrutable
will
of
god
for
the
discipline
and
humiliation
of
the
church
in
a
sort
of
bewildered
resignation
she
waited
to
see
what
further
sufferings
were
to
come
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
the
punishment
which
for
some
mysterious
purpose
the
faithful
must
endure
but
when
close
upon
all
this
discomfiture
and
humiliation
of
her
church
followed
the
discomfiture
and
humiliation
of
her
country
in
war
and
the
near
and
evident
danger
of
an
people
possessing
the
land
all
the
smothered
fire
of
the
senora
nature
broke
out
afresh
with
unfaltering
hands
she
buckled
on
her
husband
sword
and
with
dry
eyes
saw
him
go
forth
to
fight
she
had
but
one
regret
that
she
was
not
the
mother
of
sons
to
fight
also
would
thou
wert
a
man
felipe
she
exclaimed
again
and
again
in
tones
the
child
never
forgot
would
thou
wert
a
man
that
thou
might
go
also
to
fight
these
foreigners
any
race
under
the
sun
would
have
been
to
the
senora
less
hateful
than
the
american
she
had
scorned
them
in
her
girlhood
when
they
came
trading
to
post
after
post
she
scorned
them
still
the
idea
of
being
forced
to
wage
a
war
with
pedlers
was
to
her
too
monstrous
to
be
believed
in
the
outset
she
had
no
doubt
that
the
mexicans
would
win
in
the
contest
what
she
cried
shall
we
who
won
independence
from
spain
be
beaten
by
these
traders
it
is
impossible
when
her
husband
was
brought
home
to
her
dead
killed
in
the
last
fight
the
mexican
forces
made
she
said
icily
he
would
have
chosen
to
die
rather
than
to
have
been
forced
to
see
his
country
in
the
hands
of
the
and
she
was
almost
frightened
at
herself
to
see
how
this
thought
as
it
dwelt
in
her
mind
slew
the
grief
in
her
heart
she
had
believed
she
could
not
live
if
her
husband
were
to
be
taken
away
from
her
but
she
found
herself
often
glad
that
he
was
dead
glad
that
he
was
spared
the
sight
and
the
knowledge
of
the
things
which
happened
and
even
the
yearning
tenderness
with
which
her
imagination
pictured
him
among
the
saints
was
often
turned
into
a
fierce
wondering
whether
indignation
did
not
fill
his
soul
even
in
heaven
at
the
way
things
were
going
in
the
land
for
whose
sake
he
had
died
out
of
such
throes
as
these
had
been
born
the
second
nature
which
made
senora
moreno
the
silent
reserved
stern
implacable
woman
they
knew
who
knew
her
first
when
she
was
sixty
of
the
gay
tender
sentimental
girl
who
danced
and
laughed
with
the
officers
and
prayed
and
confessed
with
the
fathers
forty
years
before
there
was
small
trace
left
now
in
the
aged
woman
silent
unsmiling
who
manoeuvred
with
her
son
and
her
head
shepherd
alike
to
bring
it
about
that
a
handful
of
indians
might
once
more
confess
their
sins
to
a
franciscan
monk
in
the
moreno
chapel
iii
juan
canito
and
senor
felipe
were
not
the
only
members
of
the
family
who
were
impatient
for
the
there
was
also
ramona
ramona
was
to
the
world
at
large
a
far
more
important
person
than
the
senora
herself
the
senora
was
of
the
past
ramona
was
of
the
present
for
one
eye
that
could
see
the
significant
at
times
solemn
beauty
of
the
senora
pale
and
shadowed
countenance
there
were
a
hundred
that
flashed
with
eager
pleasure
at
the
barest
glimpse
of
ramona
face
the
shepherds
the
herdsmen
the
maids
the
babies
the
dogs
the
poultry
all
loved
the
sight
of
ramona
all
loved
her
except
the
senora
the
senora
loved
her
not
never
had
loved
her
never
could
love
her
and
yet
she
had
stood
in
the
place
of
mother
to
the
girl
ever
since
her
childhood
and
never
once
during
the
whole
sixteen
years
of
her
life
had
shown
her
any
unkindness
in
act
she
had
promised
to
be
a
mother
to
her
and
with
all
the
inalienable
stanchness
of
her
nature
she
fulfilled
the
letter
of
her
promise
more
than
the
bond
lay
in
the
bond
but
that
was
not
the
senora
fault
the
story
of
ramona
the
senora
never
told
to
most
of
the
acquaintances
now
ramona
was
a
mystery
they
did
not
know
and
no
one
ever
asked
a
prying
question
of
the
senora
moreno
who
ramona
parents
were
whether
they
were
living
or
dead
or
why
ramona
her
name
not
being
moreno
lived
always
in
the
senora
house
as
a
daughter
tended
and
attended
equally
with
the
adored
felipe
a
few
men
and
women
here
and
there
in
the
country
could
have
told
the
strange
story
of
ramona
but
its
beginning
was
more
than
a
back
and
much
had
happened
since
then
they
seldom
thought
of
the
child
they
knew
she
was
in
the
senora
moreno
keeping
and
that
was
enough
the
affairs
of
the
generation
just
going
out
were
not
the
business
of
the
young
people
coming
in
they
would
have
tragedies
enough
of
their
own
presently
what
was
the
use
of
passing
down
the
old
ones
yet
the
story
was
not
one
to
be
forgotten
and
now
and
then
it
was
told
in
the
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
or
in
the
shadows
of
vines
on
a
lingering
afternoon
and
all
young
men
and
maidens
thrilled
who
heard
it
it
was
an
elder
sister
of
the
senora
a
sister
old
enough
to
be
wooed
and
won
while
the
senora
was
yet
at
play
who
had
been
promised
in
marriage
to
a
young
scotchman
named
angus
phail
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
angus
phail
from
the
day
that
he
first
saw
her
standing
in
the
presidio
gate
became
so
madly
her
lover
that
he
was
like
a
man
bereft
of
his
senses
this
was
the
only
excuse
ever
to
be
made
for
ramona
gonzaga
deed
it
could
never
be
denied
by
her
bitterest
accusers
that
at
the
first
and
indeed
for
many
months
she
told
angus
she
did
not
love
him
and
could
not
marry
him
and
that
it
was
only
after
his
stormy
and
ceaseless
entreaties
that
she
did
finally
promise
to
become
his
wife
then
almost
immediately
she
went
away
to
monterey
and
angus
set
sail
for
san
blas
he
was
the
owner
of
the
richest
line
of
ships
which
traded
along
the
coast
at
that
time
the
richest
stuffs
carvings
woods
pearls
and
jewels
which
came
into
the
country
came
in
his
ships
the
arrival
of
one
of
them
was
always
an
event
and
angus
himself
having
been
in
scotland
and
being
wonderfully
for
a
seafaring
man
was
made
welcome
in
all
the
best
houses
wherever
his
ships
went
into
harbor
from
monterey
to
san
diego
the
senorita
ramona
gonzaga
sailed
for
monterey
the
same
day
and
hour
her
lover
sailed
for
san
blas
they
stood
on
the
decks
waving
signals
to
each
other
as
one
sailed
away
to
the
south
the
other
to
the
north
it
was
remembered
afterward
by
those
who
were
in
the
ship
with
the
senorita
that
she
ceased
to
wave
her
signals
and
had
turned
her
face
away
long
before
her
lover
ship
was
out
of
sight
but
the
men
of
the
san
jose
said
that
angus
phail
stood
immovable
gazing
northward
till
nightfall
shut
from
his
sight
even
the
horizon
line
at
which
the
monterey
ship
had
long
before
disappeared
from
view
this
was
to
be
his
last
voyage
he
went
on
this
only
because
his
honor
was
pledged
to
do
so
also
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
that
he
would
bring
back
for
his
bride
and
for
the
home
he
meant
to
give
her
treasures
of
all
sorts
which
none
could
select
so
well
as
he
through
the
long
weeks
of
the
voyage
he
sat
on
deck
gazing
dreamily
at
the
waves
and
letting
his
imagination
feed
on
pictures
of
jewels
satins
velvets
laces
which
would
best
deck
his
wife
form
and
face
when
he
could
not
longer
bear
the
vivid
fancies
heat
in
his
blood
he
would
pace
the
deck
swifter
and
swifter
till
his
steps
were
like
those
of
one
flying
in
fear
at
such
times
the
men
heard
him
muttering
and
whispering
to
himself
ramona
ramona
mad
with
love
from
the
first
to
the
last
was
angus
phail
and
there
were
many
who
believed
that
if
he
had
ever
seen
the
hour
when
he
called
ramona
gonzaga
his
own
his
reason
would
have
fled
forever
at
that
moment
and
he
would
have
killed
either
her
or
himself
as
men
thus
mad
have
been
known
to
do
but
that
hour
never
came
when
eight
months
later
the
san
jose
sailed
into
the
santa
barbara
harbor
and
angus
phail
leaped
breathless
on
shore
the
second
man
he
met
no
friend
of
his
looking
him
maliciously
in
the
face
said
so
ho
you
just
too
late
for
the
wedding
your
sweetheart
the
handsome
gonzaga
girl
was
married
here
yesterday
to
a
fine
young
officer
of
the
monterey
presidio
angus
reeled
struck
the
man
a
blow
full
in
the
face
and
fell
on
the
ground
foaming
at
the
mouth
he
was
lifted
and
carried
into
a
house
and
speedily
recovering
burst
with
the
strength
of
a
giant
from
the
hands
of
those
who
were
holding
him
sprang
out
of
the
door
and
ran
bareheaded
up
the
road
toward
the
presidio
at
the
gate
he
was
stopped
by
the
guard
who
knew
him
is
it
true
gasped
angus
yes
senor
replied
the
man
who
said
afterward
that
his
knees
shook
under
him
with
terror
at
the
look
on
the
scotchman
face
he
feared
he
would
strike
him
dead
for
his
reply
but
instead
angus
burst
into
a
maudlin
laugh
and
turning
away
went
staggering
down
the
street
singing
and
laughing
the
next
that
was
known
of
him
was
in
a
low
where
he
was
seen
lying
on
the
floor
dead
drunk
and
from
that
day
he
sank
lower
and
lower
till
one
of
the
commonest
sights
to
be
seen
in
santa
barbara
was
angus
phail
reeling
about
tipsy
coarse
loud
profane
dangerous
see
what
the
senorita
escaped
said
the
thoughtless
she
was
quite
right
not
to
have
married
such
a
drunken
in
the
rare
intervals
when
he
was
partially
sober
he
sold
all
he
possessed
ship
after
ship
sold
for
a
song
and
the
proceeds
squandered
in
drinking
or
worse
he
never
had
a
sight
of
his
lost
bride
he
did
not
seek
it
and
she
terrified
took
every
precaution
to
avoid
it
and
soon
returned
with
her
husband
to
monterey
finally
angus
disappeared
and
after
a
time
the
news
came
up
from
los
angeles
that
he
was
there
had
gone
out
to
the
san
gabriel
mission
and
was
living
with
the
indians
some
years
later
came
the
still
more
surprising
news
that
he
had
married
a
squaw
a
squaw
with
several
indian
children
had
been
legally
married
by
the
priest
in
the
san
gabriel
mission
church
and
that
was
the
last
that
the
faithless
ramona
gonzaga
ever
heard
of
her
lover
until
years
after
her
marriage
when
one
day
he
suddenly
appeared
in
her
presence
how
he
had
gained
admittance
to
the
house
was
never
known
but
there
he
stood
before
her
bearing
in
his
arms
a
beautiful
babe
asleep
drawing
himself
up
to
the
utmost
of
his
six
feet
of
height
and
looking
at
her
sternly
with
eyes
blue
like
steel
he
said
senora
ortegna
you
once
did
me
a
great
wrong
you
sinned
and
the
lord
has
punished
you
he
has
denied
you
children
i
also
have
done
a
wrong
i
have
sinned
and
the
lord
has
punished
me
he
has
given
me
a
child
i
ask
once
more
at
your
hands
a
boon
will
you
take
this
child
of
mine
and
bring
it
up
as
a
child
of
yours
or
of
mine
ought
to
be
brought
up
the
tears
were
rolling
down
the
senora
ortegna
cheeks
the
lord
had
indeed
punished
her
in
more
ways
than
angus
phail
knew
her
childlessness
bitter
as
that
had
been
was
the
least
of
them
speechless
she
rose
and
stretched
out
her
arms
for
the
child
he
placed
it
in
them
still
the
child
slept
on
undisturbed
i
do
not
know
if
i
will
be
permitted
she
said
falteringly
my
husband
father
salvierderra
will
command
it
i
have
seen
him
replied
angus
the
senora
face
brightened
if
that
be
so
i
hope
it
can
be
as
you
wish
she
said
then
a
strange
embarrassment
came
upon
her
and
looking
down
upon
the
infant
she
said
inquiringly
but
the
child
mother
angus
face
turned
swarthy
red
perhaps
face
to
face
with
this
gentle
and
still
lovely
woman
he
had
once
so
loved
he
first
realized
to
the
full
how
wickedly
he
had
thrown
away
his
life
with
a
quick
wave
of
his
hand
which
spoke
volumes
he
said
that
is
nothing
she
has
other
children
of
her
own
blood
this
is
mine
my
only
one
my
daughter
i
wish
her
to
be
yours
otherwise
she
will
be
taken
by
the
with
each
second
that
she
felt
the
little
warm
body
tender
weight
in
her
arms
ramona
ortegna
heart
had
more
and
more
yearned
towards
the
infant
at
these
words
she
bent
her
face
down
and
kissed
its
cheek
oh
no
not
to
the
church
i
will
love
it
as
my
own
she
said
angus
phail
face
quivered
feelings
long
dead
within
him
stirred
in
their
graves
he
gazed
at
the
sad
and
altered
face
once
so
beautiful
so
dear
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
senora
burst
from
him
involuntarily
she
smiled
piteously
with
no
resentment
that
is
not
strange
i
hardly
know
myself
she
whispered
life
has
dealt
very
hardly
with
me
i
should
not
have
known
you
either
she
pronounced
his
name
hesitatingly
half
appealingly
at
the
sound
of
the
familiar
syllables
so
long
unheard
the
man
heart
broke
down
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sobbed
out
o
ramona
forgive
me
i
brought
the
child
here
not
wholly
in
love
partly
in
vengeance
but
i
am
melted
now
are
you
sure
you
wish
to
keep
her
i
will
take
her
away
if
you
are
never
so
long
as
i
live
angus
replied
senora
ortegna
already
i
feel
that
she
is
a
mercy
from
the
lord
if
my
husband
sees
no
offence
in
her
presence
she
will
be
a
joy
in
my
life
has
she
been
christened
angus
cast
his
eyes
down
a
sudden
fear
smote
him
before
i
had
thought
of
bringing
her
to
you
he
stammered
at
first
i
had
only
the
thought
of
giving
her
to
the
church
i
had
had
her
christened
by
the
words
refused
to
leave
his
lips
the
name
can
you
not
guess
senora
what
name
she
bears
the
senora
knew
my
own
she
said
angus
bowed
his
head
the
only
woman
name
that
my
lips
ever
spoke
with
love
he
said
reassured
was
the
name
my
daughter
should
it
is
well
replied
the
senora
then
a
great
silence
fell
between
them
each
studied
the
other
face
tenderly
bewilderedly
then
by
a
simultaneous
impulse
they
drew
nearer
angus
stretched
out
both
his
arms
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
love
and
despair
bent
down
and
kissed
the
hands
which
lovingly
held
his
sleeping
child
god
bless
you
ramona
farewell
you
will
never
see
me
more
he
cried
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
more
he
reappeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
but
only
to
say
in
a
low
tone
there
is
no
need
to
be
alarmed
if
the
child
does
not
wake
for
some
hours
yet
she
has
had
a
safe
given
her
it
will
not
harm
one
more
long
lingering
look
into
each
other
faces
and
the
two
lovers
so
strangely
parted
still
more
strangely
met
had
parted
again
forever
the
quarter
of
a
century
which
had
lain
between
them
had
been
bridged
in
both
their
hearts
as
if
it
were
but
a
day
in
the
heart
of
the
man
it
was
the
old
passionate
adoring
love
reawakening
a
resurrection
of
the
buried
dead
to
full
life
with
lineaments
unchanged
in
the
woman
it
was
not
that
there
was
no
buried
love
to
come
to
such
resurrection
in
her
heart
for
she
had
never
loved
angus
phail
but
long
unloved
heartbroken
she
woke
at
that
moment
to
the
realization
of
what
manner
of
love
it
had
been
which
she
had
thrown
away
in
her
youth
her
whole
being
yearned
for
it
now
and
angus
was
avenged
when
francis
ortegna
late
that
night
reeled
into
his
wife
room
he
was
suddenly
sobered
by
the
sight
which
met
his
eyes
his
wife
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
cradle
in
which
lay
smiling
in
its
sleep
a
beautiful
infant
what
in
the
devil
name
he
began
then
recollecting
he
muttered
oh
the
indian
brat
i
see
i
wish
you
joy
senora
ortegna
of
your
first
child
and
with
a
mock
bow
and
cruel
sneer
he
staggered
by
giving
the
cradle
an
angry
thrust
with
his
foot
as
he
passed
the
brutal
taunt
did
not
much
wound
the
senora
the
time
had
long
since
passed
when
unkind
words
from
her
husband
could
give
her
keen
pain
but
it
was
a
warning
not
lost
upon
her
mother
instinct
and
from
that
day
the
little
ramona
was
carefully
kept
and
tended
in
apartments
where
there
was
no
danger
of
her
being
seen
by
the
man
to
whom
the
sight
of
her
baby
face
was
only
a
signal
for
anger
and
indecency
hitherto
ramona
ortegna
had
so
far
as
was
possible
carefully
concealed
from
her
family
the
unhappiness
of
her
married
life
character
was
indeed
well
known
his
neglect
of
his
wife
his
shameful
dissipations
of
all
sorts
were
notorious
in
every
port
in
the
country
but
from
the
wife
herself
no
one
had
even
heard
so
much
as
a
syllable
of
complaint
she
was
a
gonzaga
and
she
knew
how
to
suffer
in
silence
but
now
she
saw
a
reason
for
taking
her
sister
into
her
confidence
it
was
plain
to
her
that
she
had
not
many
years
to
live
and
what
then
would
become
of
the
child
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
ortegna
it
was
only
too
certain
what
would
become
of
her
long
sad
hours
of
perplexity
the
lonely
woman
passed
with
the
little
laughing
babe
in
her
arms
vainly
endeavoring
to
forecast
her
future
the
near
chance
of
her
own
death
had
not
occurred
to
her
mind
when
she
accepted
the
trust
before
the
little
ramona
was
a
year
old
angus
phail
died
an
indian
messenger
from
san
gabriel
brought
the
news
to
senora
ortegna
he
brought
her
also
a
box
and
a
letter
given
to
him
by
angus
the
day
before
his
death
the
box
contained
jewels
of
value
of
fashions
a
quarter
of
a
century
old
they
were
the
jewels
which
angus
had
bought
for
his
bride
these
alone
remained
of
all
his
fortune
even
in
the
lowest
depths
of
his
degradation
a
certain
sentiment
had
restrained
him
from
parting
with
them
the
letter
contained
only
these
words
i
send
you
all
i
have
to
leave
my
daughter
i
meant
to
bring
them
myself
this
year
i
wished
to
kiss
your
hands
and
hers
once
more
but
i
am
dying
after
these
jewels
were
in
her
possession
senora
ortegna
rested
not
till
she
had
persuaded
senora
moreno
to
journey
to
monterey
and
had
put
the
box
into
her
keeping
as
a
sacred
trust
she
also
won
from
her
a
solemn
promise
that
at
her
own
death
she
would
adopt
the
little
ramona
this
promise
came
hard
from
senora
moreno
except
for
father
salvierderra
influence
she
had
not
given
it
she
did
not
wish
any
dealings
with
such
alien
and
mongrel
blood
if
the
child
were
pure
indian
i
would
like
it
better
she
said
i
like
not
these
crosses
it
is
the
worst
and
not
the
best
of
each
that
but
the
promise
once
given
senora
ortegna
was
content
well
she
knew
that
her
sister
would
not
lie
nor
evade
a
trust
the
little
future
was
assured
during
the
last
years
of
the
unhappy
woman
life
the
child
was
her
only
comfort
ortegna
conduct
had
become
so
openly
and
defiantly
infamous
that
he
even
flaunted
his
illegitimate
relations
in
his
wife
presence
subjecting
her
to
gross
insults
spite
of
her
helpless
invalidism
this
last
outrage
was
too
much
for
the
gonzaga
blood
to
endure
the
senora
never
afterward
left
her
apartment
or
spoke
to
her
husband
once
more
she
sent
for
her
sister
to
come
this
time
to
see
her
die
every
valuable
she
possessed
jewels
laces
brocades
and
damasks
she
gave
into
her
sister
charge
to
save
them
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
base
creature
that
she
knew
only
too
well
would
stand
in
her
place
as
soon
as
the
funeral
services
had
been
said
over
her
dead
body
stealthily
as
if
she
had
been
a
thief
the
sorrowing
senora
moreno
conveyed
her
sister
wardrobe
article
by
article
out
of
the
house
to
be
sent
to
her
own
home
it
was
the
wardrobe
of
a
princess
the
ortegnas
lavished
money
always
on
the
women
whose
hearts
they
broke
and
never
ceased
to
demand
of
them
that
they
should
sit
superbly
arrayed
in
their
lonely
wretchedness
one
hour
after
the
funeral
with
a
scant
and
icy
ceremony
of
farewell
to
her
dead
sister
husband
senora
moreno
leading
the
little
ramona
by
the
hand
left
the
house
and
early
the
next
morning
set
sail
for
home
when
ortegna
discovered
that
his
wife
jewels
and
valuables
of
all
kinds
were
gone
he
fell
into
a
great
rage
and
sent
a
messenger
off
with
an
insulting
letter
to
the
senora
moreno
demanding
their
return
for
answer
he
got
a
copy
of
his
wife
memoranda
of
instructions
to
her
sister
giving
all
the
said
valuables
to
her
in
trust
for
ramona
also
a
letter
from
father
salvierderra
upon
reading
which
he
sank
into
a
fit
of
despondency
that
lasted
a
day
or
two
and
gave
his
infamous
associates
considerable
alarm
lest
they
had
lost
their
comrade
but
he
soon
shook
off
the
influence
whatever
it
was
and
settled
back
into
his
old
gait
on
the
same
old
to
the
devil
father
salvierderra
could
alarm
him
but
not
save
him
and
this
was
the
mystery
of
ramona
no
wonder
the
senora
moreno
never
told
the
story
no
wonder
perhaps
that
she
never
loved
the
child
it
was
a
sad
legacy
indissolubly
linked
with
memories
which
had
in
them
nothing
but
bitterness
shame
and
sorrow
from
first
to
last
how
much
of
all
this
the
young
ramona
knew
or
suspected
was
locked
in
her
own
breast
her
indian
blood
had
as
much
proud
reserve
in
it
as
was
ever
infused
into
the
haughtiest
gonzaga
veins
while
she
was
yet
a
little
child
she
had
one
day
said
to
the
senora
moreno
senora
why
did
my
mother
give
me
to
the
senora
ortegna
taken
unawares
the
senora
replied
hastily
your
mother
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
it
was
your
was
my
mother
dead
continued
the
child
too
late
the
senora
saw
her
mistake
i
do
not
know
she
replied
which
was
literally
true
but
had
the
spirit
of
a
lie
in
it
i
never
saw
your
did
the
senora
ortegna
ever
see
her
persisted
ramona
no
never
answered
the
senora
coldly
the
old
wounds
burning
at
the
innocent
child
unconscious
touch
ramona
felt
the
chill
and
was
silent
for
a
time
her
face
sad
and
her
eyes
tearful
at
last
she
said
i
wish
i
knew
if
my
mother
was
why
asked
the
senora
because
if
she
is
not
dead
i
would
ask
her
why
she
did
not
want
me
to
stay
with
the
gentle
piteousness
of
this
reply
smote
the
senora
conscience
taking
the
child
in
her
arms
she
said
who
has
been
talking
to
you
of
these
things
ramona
juan
can
she
replied
what
did
he
say
asked
the
senora
with
a
look
in
her
eye
which
boded
no
good
to
juan
canito
it
was
not
to
me
he
said
it
it
was
to
luigo
but
i
heard
him
answered
ramona
speaking
slowly
as
if
collecting
her
various
reminiscences
on
the
subject
twice
i
heard
him
he
said
that
my
mother
was
no
good
and
that
my
father
was
bad
and
the
tears
rolled
down
the
child
cheeks
the
senora
sense
of
justice
stood
her
well
in
place
of
tenderness
now
caressing
the
little
orphan
as
she
had
never
before
done
she
said
with
an
earnestness
which
sank
deep
into
the
child
mind
ramona
must
not
believe
any
such
thing
as
that
juan
can
is
a
bad
man
to
say
it
he
never
saw
either
your
father
or
your
mother
and
so
he
could
know
nothing
about
them
i
knew
your
father
very
well
he
was
not
a
bad
man
he
was
my
friend
and
the
friend
of
the
senora
ortegna
and
that
was
the
reason
he
gave
you
to
the
senora
ortegna
because
she
had
no
child
of
her
own
and
i
think
your
mother
had
a
good
oh
said
ramona
relieved
for
the
moment
at
this
new
view
of
the
situation
that
the
gift
had
been
not
as
a
charity
to
her
but
to
the
senora
ortegna
did
the
senora
ortegna
want
a
little
daughter
very
much
yes
very
much
indeed
said
the
senora
heartily
and
with
fervor
she
had
grieved
many
years
because
she
had
no
silence
again
for
a
brief
space
during
which
the
little
lonely
heart
grappling
with
its
vague
instinct
of
loss
and
wrong
made
wide
thrusts
into
the
perplexities
hedging
it
about
and
presently
electrified
the
senora
by
saying
in
a
why
did
not
my
father
bring
me
to
you
first
did
he
know
you
did
not
want
any
daughter
the
senora
was
dumb
for
a
second
then
recovering
herself
she
said
your
father
was
the
senora
ortegna
friend
more
than
he
was
mine
i
was
only
a
child
of
course
you
did
not
need
any
daughter
when
you
had
felipe
continued
ramona
pursuing
her
original
line
of
inquiry
and
reflection
without
noticing
the
senora
reply
a
son
is
more
than
a
daughter
but
most
people
have
both
eying
the
senora
keenly
to
see
what
response
this
would
bring
but
the
senora
was
weary
and
uncomfortable
with
the
talk
at
the
very
mention
of
felipe
a
swift
flash
of
consciousness
of
her
inability
to
love
ramona
had
swept
through
her
mind
ramona
she
said
firmly
while
you
are
a
little
girl
you
can
not
understand
any
of
these
things
when
you
are
a
woman
i
will
tell
you
all
that
i
know
myself
about
your
father
and
your
mother
it
is
very
little
your
father
died
when
you
were
only
two
years
old
all
that
you
have
to
do
is
to
be
a
good
child
and
say
your
prayers
and
when
father
salvierderra
comes
he
will
be
pleased
with
you
and
he
will
not
be
pleased
if
you
ask
troublesome
questions
do
ever
speak
to
me
again
about
this
when
the
proper
time
comes
i
will
tell
you
this
was
when
ramona
was
ten
she
was
now
nineteen
she
had
never
again
asked
the
senora
a
question
bearing
on
the
forbidden
subject
she
had
been
a
good
child
and
said
her
prayers
and
father
salvierderra
had
been
always
pleased
with
her
growing
more
and
more
deeply
attached
to
her
year
by
year
but
the
proper
time
had
not
yet
come
for
the
senora
to
tell
her
anything
more
about
her
father
and
mother
there
were
few
mornings
on
which
the
girl
did
not
think
perhaps
it
may
be
that
she
will
tell
but
she
would
not
ask
every
word
of
that
conversation
was
as
vivid
in
her
mind
as
it
had
been
the
day
it
occurred
and
it
would
hardly
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
during
every
day
of
the
whole
nine
years
had
deepened
in
her
heart
the
conviction
which
had
prompted
the
child
question
did
he
know
that
you
did
not
want
any
daughter
a
nature
less
gentle
than
ramona
would
have
been
embittered
or
at
least
hardened
by
this
consciousness
but
ramona
was
not
she
never
put
it
in
words
to
herself
she
accepted
it
as
those
born
deformed
seem
sometimes
to
accept
the
pain
and
isolation
caused
by
their
deformity
with
an
unquestioning
acceptance
which
is
as
far
above
resignation
as
resignation
is
above
rebellious
repining
no
one
would
have
known
from
ramona
face
manner
or
habitual
conduct
that
she
had
ever
experienced
a
sorrow
or
had
a
care
her
face
was
sunny
she
had
a
joyous
voice
and
never
was
seen
to
pass
a
human
being
without
a
cheerful
greeting
to
highest
and
lowest
the
same
her
industry
was
tireless
she
had
had
two
years
at
school
in
the
convent
of
the
sacred
heart
at
los
angeles
where
the
senora
had
placed
her
at
much
personal
sacrifice
during
one
of
the
hardest
times
the
moreno
estate
had
ever
seen
here
she
had
won
the
affection
of
all
the
sisters
who
spoke
of
her
habitually
as
the
blessed
they
had
taught
her
all
the
dainty
arts
of
embroidery
and
simple
fashions
of
painting
and
drawing
which
they
knew
not
overmuch
learning
out
of
books
but
enough
to
make
her
a
passionate
lover
of
verse
and
romance
for
serious
study
or
for
deep
thought
she
had
no
vocation
she
was
a
simple
joyous
gentle
clinging
faithful
nature
like
a
clear
brook
rippling
along
in
the
sun
a
nature
as
unlike
as
possible
to
the
senora
with
its
mysterious
depths
and
stormy
hidden
currents
of
these
ramona
was
dimly
conscious
and
at
times
had
a
tender
sorrowful
pity
for
the
senora
which
she
dared
not
show
and
could
only
express
by
renewed
industry
and
tireless
endeavor
to
fulfil
every
duty
possible
in
the
house
this
gentle
faithfulness
was
not
wholly
lost
on
senora
moreno
though
its
source
she
never
suspected
and
it
won
no
new
recognition
from
her
for
ramona
no
increase
of
love
but
there
was
one
on
whom
not
an
act
not
a
look
not
a
smile
of
all
this
graciousness
was
thrown
away
that
one
was
felipe
daily
more
and
more
he
wondered
at
his
mother
lack
of
affection
for
ramona
nobody
knew
so
well
as
he
how
far
short
she
stopped
of
loving
her
felipe
knew
what
it
meant
how
it
felt
to
be
loved
by
the
senora
moreno
but
felipe
had
learned
while
he
was
a
boy
that
one
sure
way
to
displease
his
mother
was
to
appear
to
be
aware
that
she
did
not
treat
ramona
as
she
treated
him
and
long
before
he
had
become
a
man
he
had
acquired
the
habit
of
keeping
to
himself
most
of
the
things
he
thought
and
felt
about
his
little
playmate
sister
a
dangerous
habit
out
of
which
were
slowly
ripening
bitter
fruits
for
the
senora
gathering
in
later
years
iv
it
was
longer
even
than
the
senora
had
thought
it
would
be
before
father
salvierderra
arrived
the
old
man
had
grown
feeble
during
the
year
that
she
had
not
seen
him
and
it
was
a
very
short
day
journey
that
he
could
make
now
without
too
great
fatigue
it
was
not
only
his
body
that
had
failed
he
had
lost
heart
and
the
miles
which
would
have
been
nothing
to
him
had
he
walked
in
the
companionship
of
hopeful
and
happy
thoughts
stretched
out
wearily
as
he
brooded
over
sad
memories
and
still
sadder
anticipations
the
downfall
of
the
missions
the
loss
of
their
vast
estates
and
the
growing
power
of
the
ungodly
in
the
land
the
final
decision
of
the
united
states
government
in
regard
to
the
had
been
a
terrible
blow
to
him
he
had
devoutly
believed
that
ultimate
restoration
of
these
great
estates
to
the
church
was
inevitable
in
the
long
vigils
which
he
always
kept
when
at
home
at
the
franciscan
monastery
in
santa
barbara
kneeling
on
the
stone
pavement
in
the
church
and
praying
ceaselessly
from
midnight
till
dawn
he
had
often
had
visions
vouchsafed
him
of
a
new
dispensation
in
which
the
mission
establishments
should
be
reinstated
in
all
their
old
splendor
and
prosperity
and
their
indian
converts
again
numbered
by
tens
of
thousands
long
after
every
one
knew
that
this
was
impossible
he
would
narrate
these
visions
with
the
faith
of
an
old
bible
seer
and
declare
that
they
must
come
true
and
that
it
was
a
sin
to
despond
but
as
year
after
year
he
journeyed
up
and
down
the
country
seeing
at
mission
after
mission
the
buildings
crumbling
into
ruin
the
lands
all
taken
sold
resold
and
settled
by
greedy
speculators
the
indian
converts
disappearing
driven
back
to
their
original
wildernesses
the
last
traces
of
the
noble
work
of
his
order
being
rapidly
swept
away
his
courage
faltered
his
faith
died
out
changes
in
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
order
itself
also
were
giving
him
deep
pain
he
was
a
franciscan
of
the
same
type
as
francis
of
assisi
to
wear
a
shoe
in
place
of
a
sandal
to
take
money
in
a
purse
for
a
journey
above
all
to
lay
aside
the
gray
gown
and
cowl
for
any
sort
of
secular
garment
seemed
to
him
wicked
to
own
comfortable
clothes
while
there
were
others
suffering
for
want
of
them
and
there
were
always
such
seemed
to
him
a
sin
for
which
one
might
not
undeservedly
be
smitten
with
sudden
and
terrible
punishment
in
vain
the
brothers
again
and
again
supplied
him
with
a
warm
cloak
he
gave
it
away
to
the
first
beggar
he
met
and
as
for
food
the
refectory
would
have
been
left
bare
and
the
whole
brotherhood
starving
if
the
supplies
had
not
been
carefully
hidden
and
locked
so
that
father
salvierderra
could
not
give
them
all
away
he
was
fast
becoming
that
most
tragic
yet
often
sublime
sight
a
man
who
has
survived
not
only
his
own
time
but
the
ideas
and
ideals
of
it
earth
holds
no
sharper
loneliness
the
bitterness
of
exile
the
anguish
of
friendlessness
at
their
utmost
are
in
it
and
yet
it
is
so
much
greater
than
they
that
even
they
seem
small
part
of
it
it
was
with
thoughts
such
as
these
that
father
salvierderra
drew
near
the
home
of
the
senora
moreno
late
in
the
afternoon
of
one
of
those
midsummer
days
of
which
southern
california
has
so
many
in
spring
the
almonds
had
bloomed
and
the
blossoms
fallen
the
apricots
also
and
the
peaches
and
pears
on
all
the
orchards
of
these
fruits
had
come
a
filmy
tint
of
green
so
light
it
was
hardly
more
than
a
shadow
on
the
gray
the
willows
were
vivid
light
green
and
the
orange
groves
dark
and
glossy
like
laurel
the
billowy
hills
on
either
side
the
valley
were
covered
with
verdure
and
bloom
myriads
of
low
blossoming
plants
so
close
to
the
earth
that
their
tints
lapped
and
overlapped
on
each
other
and
on
the
green
of
the
grass
as
feathers
in
fine
plumage
overlap
each
other
and
blend
into
a
changeful
color
the
countless
curves
hollows
and
crests
of
the
in
southern
california
heighten
these
chameleon
effects
of
the
spring
verdure
they
are
like
nothing
in
nature
except
the
glitter
of
a
brilliant
lizard
in
the
sun
or
the
iridescent
sheen
of
a
peacock
neck
father
salvierderra
paused
many
times
to
gaze
at
the
beautiful
picture
flowers
were
always
dear
to
the
franciscans
saint
francis
himself
permitted
all
decorations
which
could
be
made
of
flowers
he
classed
them
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
the
sun
moon
and
stars
all
members
of
the
sacred
choir
praising
god
it
was
melancholy
to
see
how
after
each
one
of
these
pauses
each
fresh
drinking
in
of
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
and
the
balmy
air
the
old
man
resumed
his
slow
pace
with
a
long
sigh
and
his
eyes
cast
down
the
fairer
this
beautiful
land
the
sadder
to
know
it
lost
to
the
church
alien
hands
reaping
its
fulness
establishing
new
customs
new
laws
all
the
way
down
the
coast
from
santa
barbara
he
had
seen
at
every
new
tokens
of
the
settling
up
of
the
country
farms
opening
towns
growing
the
americans
pouring
in
at
all
points
to
reap
the
advantages
of
their
new
possessions
it
was
this
which
had
made
his
journey
and
made
him
feel
in
approaching
the
senora
moreno
as
if
he
were
coming
to
one
of
the
last
sure
strongholds
of
the
catholic
faith
left
in
the
country
when
he
was
within
two
miles
of
the
house
he
struck
off
from
the
highway
into
a
narrow
path
that
he
recollected
led
by
a
through
the
hills
and
saved
nearly
a
third
of
the
distance
it
was
more
than
a
year
since
he
had
trod
this
path
and
as
he
found
it
growing
fainter
and
fainter
and
more
and
more
overgrown
with
the
wild
mustard
he
said
to
himself
i
think
no
one
can
have
passed
through
here
this
as
he
proceeded
he
found
the
mustard
thicker
and
thicker
the
wild
mustard
in
southern
california
is
like
that
spoken
of
in
the
new
testament
in
the
branches
of
which
the
birds
of
the
air
may
rest
coming
up
out
of
the
earth
so
slender
a
stem
that
dozens
can
find
in
an
inch
it
darts
up
a
slender
straight
shoot
five
ten
twenty
feet
with
hundreds
of
fine
feathery
branches
locking
and
interlocking
with
all
the
other
hundreds
around
it
till
it
is
an
inextricable
network
like
lace
then
it
bursts
into
yellow
bloom
still
finer
more
feathery
and
lacelike
the
stems
are
so
infinitesimally
small
and
of
so
dark
a
green
that
at
a
short
distance
they
do
not
show
and
the
cloud
of
blossom
seems
floating
in
the
air
at
times
it
looks
like
golden
dust
with
a
clear
blue
sky
behind
it
as
it
is
often
seen
it
looks
like
a
golden
the
plant
is
a
tyrant
and
a
nuisance
the
terror
of
the
farmer
it
takes
riotous
possession
of
a
whole
field
in
a
season
once
in
never
out
for
one
plant
this
year
a
million
the
next
but
it
is
impossible
to
wish
that
the
land
were
freed
from
it
its
gold
is
as
distinct
a
value
to
the
eye
as
the
nugget
gold
is
in
the
pocket
father
salvierderra
soon
found
himself
in
a
veritable
thicket
of
these
delicate
branches
high
above
his
head
and
so
interlaced
that
he
could
make
headway
only
by
slowly
and
patiently
disentangling
them
as
one
would
disentangle
a
skein
of
silk
it
was
a
fantastic
sort
of
dilemma
and
not
unpleasing
except
that
the
father
was
in
haste
to
reach
his
journey
end
he
would
have
enjoyed
threading
his
way
through
the
golden
meshes
suddenly
he
heard
faint
notes
of
singing
he
paused
listened
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
it
was
slowly
drawing
nearer
apparently
from
the
direction
in
which
he
was
going
at
intervals
it
ceased
abruptly
then
began
again
as
if
by
a
sudden
but
brief
interruption
like
that
made
by
question
and
answer
then
peering
ahead
through
the
mustard
blossoms
he
saw
them
waving
and
bending
and
heard
sounds
as
if
they
were
being
broken
evidently
some
one
entering
on
the
path
from
the
opposite
end
had
been
caught
in
the
fragrant
thicket
as
he
was
the
notes
grew
clearer
though
still
low
and
sweet
as
the
twilight
notes
of
the
thrush
the
mustard
branches
waved
more
and
more
violently
light
steps
were
now
to
be
heard
father
salvierderra
stood
still
as
one
in
a
dream
his
eyes
straining
forward
into
the
golden
mist
of
blossoms
in
a
moment
more
came
distinct
and
clear
to
his
ear
the
beautiful
words
of
the
second
stanza
of
saint
inimitable
lyric
the
canticle
of
the
sun
praise
be
to
thee
o
lord
for
all
thy
creatures
and
especially
for
our
brother
the
sun
who
illuminates
the
day
and
by
his
beauty
and
splendor
shadows
forth
unto
us
ramona
exclaimed
the
father
his
thin
cheeks
flushing
with
pleasure
the
blessed
child
and
as
he
spoke
her
face
came
into
sight
set
in
a
swaying
frame
of
the
blossoms
as
she
parted
them
lightly
to
right
and
left
with
her
hands
and
half
crept
half
danced
through
the
openings
thus
made
father
salvierderra
was
past
eighty
but
his
blood
was
not
too
old
to
move
quicker
at
the
sight
of
this
picture
a
man
must
be
dead
not
to
thrill
at
it
ramona
beauty
was
of
the
sort
to
be
best
enhanced
by
the
waving
gold
which
now
framed
her
face
she
had
just
enough
of
olive
tint
in
her
complexion
to
underlie
and
enrich
her
skin
without
making
it
swarthy
her
hair
was
like
her
indian
mother
heavy
and
black
but
her
eyes
were
like
her
father
only
those
who
came
very
near
to
ramona
knew
however
that
her
eyes
were
blue
for
the
heavy
black
eyebrows
and
long
black
lashes
so
shaded
and
shadowed
them
that
they
looked
black
as
night
at
the
same
instant
that
father
salvierderra
first
caught
sight
of
her
face
ramona
also
saw
him
and
crying
out
joyfully
ah
father
i
knew
you
would
come
by
this
path
and
something
told
me
you
were
near
she
sprang
forward
and
sank
on
her
knees
before
him
bowing
her
head
for
his
blessing
in
silence
he
laid
his
hands
on
her
brow
it
would
not
have
been
easy
for
him
to
speak
to
her
at
that
first
moment
she
had
looked
to
the
devout
old
monk
as
she
sprang
through
the
cloud
of
golden
flowers
the
sun
falling
on
her
bared
head
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
shining
more
like
an
apparition
of
an
angel
or
saint
than
like
the
maiden
whom
he
had
carried
in
his
arms
when
she
was
a
babe
we
have
been
waiting
waiting
oh
so
long
for
you
father
she
said
rising
we
began
to
fear
that
you
might
be
ill
the
shearers
have
been
sent
for
and
will
be
here
tonight
and
that
was
the
reason
i
felt
so
sure
you
would
come
i
knew
the
virgin
would
bring
you
in
time
for
mass
in
the
chapel
on
the
first
the
monk
smiled
half
sadly
would
there
were
more
with
such
faith
as
yours
daughter
he
said
are
all
well
on
the
place
yes
father
all
well
she
answered
felipe
has
been
ill
with
a
fever
but
he
is
out
now
these
ten
days
and
fretting
for
for
your
ramona
had
like
to
have
said
the
literal
truth
fretting
for
the
but
recollected
herself
in
time
and
the
senora
said
the
father
she
is
well
answered
ramona
gently
but
with
a
slight
change
of
tone
so
slight
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
but
an
acute
observer
would
have
always
detected
it
in
the
girl
tone
whenever
she
spoke
of
the
senora
moreno
and
you
are
you
well
yourself
father
she
asked
affectionately
noting
with
her
quick
loving
eye
how
feebly
the
old
man
walked
and
that
he
carried
what
she
had
never
before
seen
in
his
hand
a
stout
staff
to
steady
his
steps
you
must
be
very
tired
with
the
long
journey
on
ay
ramona
i
am
tired
he
replied
old
age
is
conquering
me
it
will
not
be
many
times
more
that
i
shall
see
this
oh
do
not
say
that
father
cried
ramona
you
can
ride
when
it
tires
you
too
much
to
walk
the
senora
said
only
the
other
day
that
she
wished
you
would
let
her
give
you
a
horse
that
it
was
not
right
for
you
to
take
these
long
journeys
on
foot
you
know
we
have
hundreds
of
horses
it
is
nothing
one
horse
she
added
seeing
the
father
slowly
shake
his
head
no
he
said
it
is
not
that
i
could
not
refuse
anything
at
the
hands
of
the
senora
but
it
was
the
rule
of
our
order
to
go
on
foot
we
must
deny
the
flesh
look
at
our
beloved
master
in
this
land
father
junipero
when
he
was
past
eighty
walking
from
san
diego
to
monterey
and
all
the
while
a
running
ulcer
in
one
of
his
legs
for
which
most
men
would
have
taken
to
a
bed
to
be
healed
it
is
a
sinful
fashion
that
is
coming
in
for
monks
to
take
their
ease
doing
god
work
i
can
no
longer
walk
swiftly
but
i
must
walk
all
the
more
while
they
were
talking
they
had
been
slowly
moving
forward
ramona
slightly
in
advance
gracefully
bending
the
mustard
branches
and
holding
them
down
till
the
father
had
followed
in
her
steps
as
they
came
out
from
the
thicket
she
exclaimed
laughing
there
is
felipe
in
the
willows
i
told
him
i
was
coming
to
meet
you
and
he
laughed
at
me
now
he
will
see
i
was
astonished
enough
felipe
hearing
voices
looked
up
and
saw
ramona
and
the
father
approaching
throwing
down
the
knife
with
which
he
had
been
cutting
the
willows
he
hastened
to
meet
them
and
dropped
on
his
knees
as
ramona
had
done
for
the
monk
blessing
as
he
knelt
there
the
wind
blowing
his
hair
loosely
off
his
brow
his
large
brown
eyes
lifted
in
gentle
reverence
to
the
father
face
and
his
face
full
of
affectionate
welcome
ramona
thought
to
herself
as
she
had
thought
hundreds
of
times
since
she
became
a
woman
how
beautiful
felipe
is
no
wonder
the
senora
loves
him
so
much
if
i
had
been
beautiful
like
that
she
would
have
liked
me
never
was
a
little
child
more
unconscious
of
her
own
beauty
than
ramona
still
was
all
the
admiration
which
was
expressed
to
her
in
word
and
look
she
took
for
simple
kindness
and
her
face
as
she
herself
saw
it
in
her
glass
did
not
please
her
she
compared
her
straight
massive
black
eyebrows
with
felipe
arched
and
delicately
pencilled
and
found
her
own
ugly
the
expression
of
gentle
repose
which
her
countenance
wore
seemed
to
her
an
expression
of
stupidity
felipe
looks
so
bright
she
thought
as
she
noted
his
mobile
changing
face
never
for
two
successive
seconds
the
same
there
is
nobody
like
and
when
his
brown
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
as
they
so
often
were
in
a
long
lingering
gaze
she
looked
steadily
back
into
their
velvet
depths
with
an
abstracted
sort
of
intensity
which
profoundly
puzzled
felipe
it
was
this
look
more
than
any
other
one
thing
which
had
for
two
years
held
felipe
tongue
in
leash
as
it
were
and
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
say
to
ramona
any
of
the
loving
things
of
which
his
heart
had
been
full
ever
since
he
could
remember
the
boy
had
spoken
them
unhesitatingly
unconsciously
but
the
man
found
himself
suddenly
afraid
what
is
it
she
thinks
when
she
looks
into
my
eyes
so
he
wondered
if
he
had
known
that
the
thing
she
was
usually
thinking
was
simply
how
much
handsomer
brown
eyes
are
than
blue
i
wish
my
eyes
were
the
color
of
felipe
he
would
have
perceived
perhaps
what
would
have
saved
him
sorrow
if
he
had
known
it
that
a
girl
who
looked
at
a
man
thus
would
be
hard
to
win
to
look
at
him
as
a
lover
but
being
a
lover
he
could
not
see
this
he
saw
only
enough
to
perplex
and
deter
him
as
they
drew
near
the
house
ramona
saw
margarita
standing
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
she
was
holding
something
white
in
her
hands
looking
down
at
it
and
crying
piteously
as
she
perceived
ramona
she
made
an
eager
leap
forward
and
then
shrank
back
again
making
dumb
signals
of
distress
to
her
her
whole
attitude
was
one
of
misery
and
entreaty
margarita
was
of
all
the
maids
most
beloved
by
ramona
though
they
were
nearly
of
the
same
age
it
had
been
margarita
who
first
had
charge
of
ramona
the
nurse
and
her
charge
had
played
together
grown
up
together
become
women
together
and
were
now
although
margarita
never
presumed
on
the
relation
or
forgot
to
address
ramona
as
senorita
more
like
friends
than
like
mistress
and
maid
pardon
me
father
said
ramona
i
see
that
margarita
there
is
in
trouble
i
will
leave
felipe
to
go
with
you
to
the
house
i
will
be
with
you
again
in
a
few
and
kissing
his
hand
she
flew
rather
than
ran
across
the
field
to
the
foot
of
the
garden
before
she
reached
the
spot
margarita
had
dropped
on
the
ground
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
a
mass
of
crumpled
and
stained
linen
lay
at
her
feet
what
is
it
what
has
happened
margarita
mia
cried
ramona
in
the
affectionate
spanish
phrase
for
answer
margarita
removed
one
wet
hand
from
her
eyes
and
pointed
with
a
gesture
of
despair
to
the
crumpled
linen
sobs
choked
her
voice
and
she
buried
her
face
again
in
her
hands
ramona
stooped
and
lifted
one
corner
of
the
linen
an
involuntary
cry
of
dismay
broke
from
her
at
which
margarita
sobs
redoubled
and
she
gasped
out
yes
senorita
it
is
totally
ruined
it
can
never
be
mended
and
it
will
be
needed
for
the
mass
morning
when
i
saw
the
father
coming
by
your
side
i
prayed
to
the
virgin
to
let
me
die
the
senora
will
never
forgive
it
was
indeed
a
sorry
sight
the
white
linen
the
cloth
which
the
senora
moreno
had
with
her
own
hands
made
into
one
solid
front
of
beautiful
lace
of
the
mexican
fashion
by
drawing
out
part
of
the
threads
and
sewing
the
remainder
into
intricate
patterns
the
cloth
which
had
always
been
on
the
altar
when
mass
was
said
since
margarita
and
ramona
earliest
recollections
there
it
lay
torn
stained
as
if
it
had
been
dragged
through
muddy
brambles
in
silence
aghast
ramona
opened
it
out
and
held
it
up
how
did
it
happen
margarita
she
whispered
glancing
in
terror
up
towards
the
house
oh
that
is
the
worst
of
it
senorita
sobbed
the
girl
that
is
the
worst
of
it
if
it
were
not
for
that
i
would
not
be
so
afraid
if
it
had
happened
any
other
way
the
senora
might
have
forgiven
me
but
she
never
will
i
would
rather
die
than
tell
her
and
she
shook
from
head
to
foot
stop
crying
margarita
said
ramona
firmly
and
tell
me
all
about
it
it
is
so
bad
as
it
looks
i
think
i
can
mend
oh
the
saints
bless
you
cried
margarita
looking
up
for
the
first
time
do
you
really
think
you
can
mend
it
senorita
if
you
will
mend
that
lace
i
go
on
my
knees
for
you
all
the
rest
of
my
life
ramona
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
you
serve
me
better
by
keeping
on
your
feet
she
said
merrily
at
which
margarita
laughed
too
through
her
tears
they
were
both
young
oh
but
senorita
margarita
began
again
in
a
tone
of
anguish
her
tears
flowing
afresh
there
is
not
time
it
must
be
washed
and
ironed
for
the
mass
morning
and
i
have
to
help
at
the
supper
anita
and
rosa
are
both
ill
in
bed
you
know
and
maria
has
gone
away
for
a
week
the
senora
said
if
the
father
came
i
must
help
mother
and
must
wait
on
table
it
can
not
be
done
i
was
just
going
to
iron
it
now
and
i
found
it
so
it
was
in
the
and
capitan
the
beast
had
been
tossing
it
among
the
sharp
pricks
of
the
old
last
year
in
the
ejaculated
ramona
how
under
heavens
did
it
get
there
oh
that
was
what
i
meant
senorita
when
i
said
she
never
would
forgive
me
she
has
forbidden
me
many
times
to
hang
anything
to
dry
on
the
fence
there
and
if
i
had
only
washed
it
when
she
first
told
me
two
days
ago
all
would
have
been
well
but
i
forgot
it
till
this
afternoon
and
there
was
no
sun
in
the
court
to
dry
it
and
you
know
how
the
sun
lies
on
the
and
i
put
a
strong
cloth
over
the
fence
so
that
the
wood
should
not
pierce
the
lace
and
i
did
not
leave
it
more
than
half
an
hour
just
while
i
said
a
few
words
to
luigo
and
there
was
no
wind
and
i
believe
the
saints
must
have
fetched
it
down
to
the
ground
to
punish
me
for
my
ramona
had
been
all
this
time
carefully
smoothing
out
the
torn
places
it
is
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
she
said
if
it
were
not
for
the
hurry
there
would
be
no
trouble
in
mending
it
but
i
will
do
it
the
best
i
can
so
that
it
will
not
show
for
and
then
after
the
father
is
gone
i
can
repair
it
at
leisure
and
make
it
just
as
good
as
new
i
think
i
can
mend
it
and
wash
it
before
dark
and
she
glanced
at
the
sun
oh
yes
there
are
good
three
hours
of
daylight
yet
i
can
do
it
you
put
the
irons
on
the
fire
to
have
them
hot
to
iron
it
as
soon
as
it
is
partly
dried
you
will
see
it
will
not
show
that
anything
has
happened
to
will
the
senora
know
asked
poor
margarita
calmed
and
reassured
but
still
in
mortal
terror
ramona
turned
her
steady
glance
full
on
margarita
face
you
would
not
be
any
happier
if
she
were
deceived
do
you
think
she
said
gravely
o
senorita
after
it
is
mended
if
it
really
does
not
show
pleaded
the
girl
i
will
tell
her
myself
and
not
till
after
it
is
mended
said
ramona
but
she
did
not
smile
ah
senorita
said
margarita
deprecatingly
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
the
senora
displeased
with
nothing
can
be
so
bad
as
to
be
displeased
with
one
self
retorted
ramona
as
she
walked
swiftly
away
to
her
room
with
the
linen
rolled
up
under
her
arm
luckily
for
margarita
cause
she
met
no
one
on
the
way
the
senora
had
welcomed
father
salvierderra
at
the
foot
of
the
veranda
steps
and
had
immediately
closeted
herself
with
him
she
had
much
to
say
to
him
much
about
which
she
wished
his
help
and
counsel
and
much
which
she
wished
to
learn
from
him
as
to
affairs
in
the
church
and
in
the
country
generally
felipe
had
gone
off
at
once
to
find
juan
canito
to
see
if
everything
were
ready
for
the
to
begin
on
the
next
day
if
the
shearers
arrived
in
time
and
there
was
very
good
chance
of
their
coming
in
by
sundown
this
day
felipe
thought
for
he
had
privately
instructed
his
messenger
to
make
all
possible
haste
and
to
impress
on
the
indians
the
urgent
need
of
their
losing
no
time
on
the
road
it
had
been
a
great
concession
on
the
senora
part
to
allow
the
messenger
to
be
sent
off
before
she
had
positive
intelligence
as
to
the
father
movements
but
as
day
after
day
passed
and
no
news
came
even
she
perceived
that
it
would
not
do
to
put
off
the
much
longer
or
as
juan
canito
said
the
father
might
have
fallen
ill
and
if
that
were
so
it
might
very
easily
be
weeks
before
they
heard
of
it
so
scanty
were
the
means
of
communication
between
the
remote
places
on
his
route
of
visitation
the
messenger
had
therefore
been
sent
to
summon
the
temecula
shearers
and
senora
had
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
piously
praying
however
morning
and
night
and
at
odd
moments
in
the
day
that
the
father
might
arrive
before
the
indians
did
when
she
saw
him
coming
up
the
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
felipe
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
day
which
was
the
earliest
possible
day
for
the
indians
to
arrive
it
was
not
strange
that
she
felt
mingled
with
the
joy
of
her
greeting
to
her
friend
and
confessor
a
triumphant
exultation
that
the
saints
had
heard
her
prayers
in
the
kitchen
all
was
bustle
and
stir
the
coming
of
any
guest
into
the
house
was
a
signal
for
unwonted
activities
there
even
the
coming
of
father
salvierderra
who
never
knew
whether
the
soup
had
balls
in
it
or
not
old
marda
said
and
that
was
to
her
the
last
extreme
of
indifference
to
good
things
of
the
flesh
but
if
he
will
not
eat
he
can
see
she
said
and
her
pride
for
herself
and
for
the
house
was
enlisted
in
setting
forth
as
goodly
an
array
of
viands
as
her
larder
afforded
she
grew
suddenly
fastidious
over
the
size
and
color
of
the
cabbages
to
go
into
the
and
threw
away
one
whole
saucepan
full
of
rice
because
margarita
had
put
only
one
onion
in
instead
of
two
have
i
not
told
you
again
and
again
that
for
the
father
it
is
always
two
onions
she
exclaimed
it
is
the
dish
he
most
favors
of
all
and
it
is
a
pity
too
old
as
he
is
it
makes
him
no
blood
it
is
good
beef
he
should
take
the
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
courtyard
from
the
kitchen
and
there
was
a
perpetual
procession
of
small
messengers
going
back
and
forth
between
the
rooms
it
was
the
highest
ambition
of
each
child
to
be
allowed
to
fetch
and
carry
dishes
in
the
preparation
of
the
meals
at
all
times
but
when
by
so
doing
they
could
perchance
get
a
glimpse
through
the
door
open
on
the
veranda
of
strangers
and
guests
their
restless
rivalry
became
unmanageable
poor
margarita
between
her
own
private
anxieties
and
her
multiplied
duties
of
helping
in
the
kitchen
and
setting
the
table
restraining
and
overseeing
her
army
of
infant
volunteers
was
nearly
distraught
not
so
distraught
however
but
that
she
remembered
and
found
time
to
seize
a
lighted
candle
in
the
kitchen
run
and
set
it
before
the
statue
of
saint
francis
of
paula
in
her
bedroom
hurriedly
whispering
a
prayer
that
the
lace
might
be
made
whole
like
new
several
times
before
the
afternoon
had
waned
she
snatched
a
moment
to
fling
herself
down
at
the
statue
feet
and
pray
her
foolish
little
prayer
over
again
we
think
we
are
quite
sure
that
it
is
a
foolish
little
prayer
when
people
pray
to
have
torn
lace
made
whole
but
it
would
be
hard
to
show
the
odds
between
asking
that
and
asking
that
it
may
rain
or
that
the
sick
may
get
well
as
the
grand
old
russian
says
what
men
usually
ask
for
when
they
pray
to
god
is
that
two
and
two
may
not
make
four
all
the
same
he
is
to
be
pitied
who
prays
not
it
was
only
the
thought
of
that
candle
at
saint
feet
which
enabled
margarita
to
struggle
through
this
anxious
and
unhappy
afternoon
and
evening
at
last
supper
was
ready
a
great
dish
of
spiced
beef
and
cabbage
in
the
centre
of
the
table
a
tureen
of
thick
soup
with
balls
and
red
peppers
in
it
two
red
earthen
platters
heaped
one
with
the
boiled
rice
and
onions
the
other
with
the
delicious
frijoles
beans
so
dear
to
all
mexican
hearts
dishes
filled
with
hot
stewed
pears
or
preserved
quinces
or
grape
jelly
plates
of
frosted
cakes
of
various
sorts
and
a
steaming
silver
teakettle
from
which
went
up
an
aroma
of
tea
such
as
had
never
been
bought
or
sold
in
all
california
the
senora
one
extravagance
and
passion
where
is
ramona
asked
the
senora
surprised
and
displeased
as
she
entered
the
margarita
go
tell
the
senorita
that
we
are
waiting
for
margarita
started
tremblingly
with
flushed
face
towards
the
door
what
would
happen
now
o
saint
francis
she
inwardly
prayed
help
us
this
once
stay
said
felipe
do
not
call
senorita
then
turning
to
his
mother
ramona
can
not
come
she
is
not
in
the
house
she
has
a
duty
to
perform
for
he
said
and
he
looked
meaningly
at
his
mother
adding
we
will
not
wait
for
much
bewildered
the
senora
took
her
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
a
mechanical
way
and
began
but
felipe
seeing
that
questions
were
to
follow
interrupted
her
i
have
just
spoken
with
her
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
come
and
turning
to
father
salvierderra
he
at
once
engaged
him
in
conversation
and
left
the
baffled
senora
to
bear
her
unsatisfied
curiosity
as
best
she
could
margarita
looked
at
felipe
with
an
expression
of
profound
gratitude
which
he
did
not
observe
and
would
not
in
the
least
have
understood
for
ramona
had
not
confided
to
him
any
details
of
the
disaster
seeing
him
under
her
window
she
had
called
cautiously
to
him
and
said
dear
felipe
do
you
think
you
can
save
me
from
having
to
come
to
supper
a
dreadful
accident
has
happened
to
the
and
i
must
mend
it
and
wash
it
and
there
is
barely
time
before
dark
do
let
them
call
me
i
shall
be
down
at
the
brook
and
they
will
not
find
me
and
your
mother
will
be
this
wise
precaution
of
ramona
was
the
salvation
of
everything
so
far
as
the
was
concerned
the
rents
had
proved
far
less
serious
than
she
had
feared
the
daylight
held
out
till
the
last
of
them
was
skilfully
mended
and
just
as
the
red
beams
of
the
sinking
sun
came
streaming
through
the
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
ramona
darting
down
the
garden
had
reached
the
brook
and
kneeling
on
the
grass
had
dipped
the
linen
into
the
water
her
hurried
working
over
the
lace
and
her
anxiety
had
made
her
cheeks
scarlet
as
she
ran
down
the
garden
her
comb
had
loosened
and
her
hair
fallen
to
her
waist
stopping
only
to
pick
up
the
comb
and
thrust
it
in
her
pocket
she
had
sped
on
as
it
would
soon
be
too
dark
for
her
to
see
the
stains
on
the
linen
and
it
was
going
to
be
no
small
trouble
to
get
them
out
without
fraying
the
lace
her
hair
in
disorder
her
sleeves
pinned
loosely
on
her
shoulders
her
whole
face
aglow
with
the
earnestness
of
her
task
she
bent
low
over
the
stones
rinsing
the
up
and
down
in
the
water
anxiously
scanning
it
then
plunging
it
in
again
the
sunset
beams
played
around
her
hair
like
a
halo
the
whole
place
was
aglow
with
red
light
and
her
face
was
kindled
into
transcendent
beauty
a
sound
arrested
her
attention
she
looked
up
forms
dusky
black
against
the
fiery
western
sky
were
coming
down
the
valley
it
was
the
band
of
indian
shearers
they
turned
to
the
left
and
went
towards
the
sheep
sheds
and
booths
but
there
was
one
of
them
that
ramona
did
not
see
he
had
been
standing
for
some
minutes
concealed
behind
a
large
a
few
rods
from
the
place
where
ramona
was
kneeling
it
was
alessandro
son
of
pablo
assis
captain
of
the
shearing
band
walking
slowly
along
in
advance
of
his
men
he
had
felt
a
light
as
from
a
mirror
held
in
the
sun
smite
his
eyes
it
was
the
red
sunbeam
on
the
glittering
water
where
ramona
knelt
in
the
same
second
he
saw
ramona
he
halted
as
wild
creatures
of
the
forest
halt
at
a
sound
gazed
walked
abruptly
away
from
his
men
who
kept
on
not
noticing
his
disappearance
cautiously
he
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
into
the
shelter
of
a
gnarled
old
willow
from
behind
which
he
could
gaze
unperceived
on
the
beautiful
vision
for
so
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
gazed
his
senses
seemed
leaving
him
and
unconsciously
he
spoke
aloud
christ
what
shall
i
do
v
the
room
in
which
father
salvierderra
always
slept
when
at
the
senora
moreno
house
was
the
southeast
corner
room
it
had
a
window
to
the
south
and
one
to
the
east
when
the
first
glow
of
dawn
came
in
the
sky
this
eastern
window
was
lit
up
as
by
a
fire
the
father
was
always
on
watch
for
it
having
usually
been
at
prayer
for
hours
as
the
first
ray
reached
the
window
he
would
throw
the
casement
wide
open
and
standing
there
with
bared
head
strike
up
the
melody
of
the
sunrise
hymn
sung
in
all
devout
mexican
families
it
was
a
beautiful
custom
not
yet
wholly
abandoned
at
the
first
dawn
of
light
the
oldest
member
of
the
family
arose
and
began
singing
some
hymn
familiar
to
the
household
it
was
the
duty
of
each
person
hearing
it
to
immediately
rise
or
at
least
sit
up
in
bed
and
join
in
the
singing
in
a
few
moments
the
whole
family
would
be
singing
and
the
joyous
sounds
pouring
out
from
the
house
like
the
music
of
the
birds
in
the
fields
at
dawn
the
hymns
were
usually
invocations
to
the
virgin
or
to
the
saint
of
the
day
and
the
melodies
were
sweet
and
simple
on
this
morning
there
was
another
watcher
for
the
dawn
besides
father
salvierderra
it
was
alessandro
who
had
been
restlessly
wandering
about
since
midnight
and
had
finally
seated
himself
under
the
by
the
brook
at
the
spot
where
he
had
seen
ramona
the
evening
before
he
recollected
this
custom
of
the
sunrise
hymn
when
he
and
his
band
were
at
the
senora
the
last
year
and
he
had
chanced
then
to
learn
that
the
father
slept
in
the
southeast
room
from
the
spot
where
he
sat
he
could
see
the
south
window
of
this
room
he
could
also
see
the
low
eastern
horizon
at
which
a
faint
luminous
line
already
showed
the
sky
was
like
amber
a
few
stars
still
shone
faintly
in
the
zenith
there
was
not
a
sound
it
was
one
of
those
rare
moments
in
which
one
can
without
difficulty
realize
the
noiseless
spinning
of
the
earth
through
space
alessandro
knew
nothing
of
this
he
could
not
have
been
made
to
believe
that
the
earth
was
moving
he
thought
the
sun
was
coming
up
apace
and
the
earth
was
standing
still
a
belief
just
as
grand
just
as
thrilling
so
far
as
all
that
goes
as
the
other
men
worshipped
the
sun
long
before
they
found
out
that
it
stood
still
not
the
most
reverent
astronomer
with
the
mathematics
of
the
heavens
at
his
tongue
end
could
have
had
more
delight
in
the
wondrous
phenomenon
of
the
dawn
than
did
this
unlearned
man
his
eyes
wandered
from
the
horizon
line
of
slowly
increasing
light
to
the
windows
of
the
house
yet
dark
and
still
which
window
is
hers
will
she
open
it
when
the
song
begins
he
thought
is
it
on
this
side
of
the
house
who
can
she
be
she
was
not
here
last
year
saw
the
saints
ever
so
beautiful
a
creature
at
last
came
the
full
red
ray
across
the
meadow
alessandro
sprang
to
his
feet
in
the
next
second
father
salvierderra
flung
up
his
south
window
and
leaning
out
his
cowl
thrown
off
his
thin
gray
locks
streaming
back
began
in
a
feeble
but
not
unmelodious
voice
to
sing
o
beautiful
queen
princess
of
before
he
had
finished
the
second
line
a
voices
had
joined
in
the
senora
from
her
room
at
the
west
end
of
the
veranda
beyond
the
flowers
felipe
from
the
adjoining
room
ramona
from
hers
the
next
and
margarita
and
other
of
the
maids
already
astir
in
the
wings
of
the
house
as
the
volume
of
melody
swelled
the
canaries
waked
and
the
finches
and
the
linnets
in
the
veranda
roof
the
tiles
of
this
roof
were
laid
on
bundles
of
tule
reeds
in
which
the
linnets
delighted
to
build
their
nests
the
roof
was
alive
with
them
scores
and
scores
nay
hundreds
tame
as
chickens
their
tiny
shrill
twitter
was
like
the
tuning
of
myriads
of
violins
singers
at
dawn
from
the
heavens
above
people
all
regions
gladly
we
too
sing
continued
the
hymn
the
birds
corroborating
the
stanza
then
voices
joined
in
juan
and
luigo
and
a
dozen
more
walking
slowly
up
from
the
sheepfolds
the
hymn
was
a
favorite
one
known
to
all
come
o
sinners
come
and
we
will
sing
tender
hymns
to
our
refuge
was
the
chorus
repeated
after
each
of
the
five
verses
of
the
hymn
alessandro
also
knew
the
hymn
well
his
father
chief
pablo
had
been
the
leader
of
the
choir
at
the
san
luis
rey
mission
in
the
last
years
of
its
splendor
and
had
brought
away
with
him
much
of
the
old
choir
music
some
of
the
books
had
been
written
by
his
own
hand
on
parchment
he
not
only
sang
well
but
was
a
good
player
on
the
violin
there
was
not
at
any
of
the
missions
so
fine
a
band
of
performers
on
stringed
instruments
as
at
san
luis
rey
father
peyri
was
passionately
fond
of
music
and
spared
no
pains
in
training
all
the
neophytes
under
his
charge
who
showed
any
special
talent
in
that
direction
chief
pablo
after
the
breaking
up
of
the
mission
had
settled
at
temecula
with
a
small
band
of
his
indians
and
endeavored
so
far
as
was
in
his
power
to
keep
up
the
old
religious
services
the
music
in
the
little
chapel
of
the
temecula
indians
was
a
surprise
to
all
who
heard
it
alessandro
had
inherited
his
father
love
and
talent
for
music
and
knew
all
the
old
mission
music
by
heart
this
hymn
to
the
beautiful
queen
princess
of
heaven
was
one
of
his
special
favorites
and
as
he
heard
verse
after
verse
rising
he
could
not
forbear
striking
in
at
the
first
notes
of
this
rich
new
voice
ramona
voice
ceased
in
surprise
and
throwing
up
her
window
she
leaned
out
eagerly
looking
in
all
directions
to
see
who
it
could
be
alessandro
saw
her
and
sang
no
more
what
could
it
have
been
did
i
dream
it
thought
ramona
drew
in
her
head
and
began
to
sing
again
with
the
next
stanza
of
the
chorus
the
same
rich
barytone
notes
they
seemed
to
float
in
under
all
the
rest
and
bear
them
along
as
a
great
wave
bears
a
boat
ramona
had
never
heard
such
a
voice
felipe
had
a
good
tenor
and
she
liked
to
sing
with
him
or
to
hear
him
but
this
this
was
from
another
world
this
sound
ramona
felt
every
note
of
it
penetrating
her
consciousness
with
a
subtle
thrill
almost
like
pain
when
the
hymn
ended
she
listened
eagerly
hoping
father
salvierderra
would
strike
up
a
second
hymn
as
he
often
did
but
he
did
not
this
morning
there
was
too
much
to
be
done
everybody
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
at
work
windows
shut
doors
opened
the
sounds
of
voices
from
all
directions
ordering
questioning
answering
began
to
be
heard
the
sun
rose
and
let
a
flood
of
light
on
the
whole
place
margarita
ran
and
unlocked
the
chapel
door
putting
up
a
heartfelt
thanksgiving
to
saint
francis
and
the
senorita
as
she
saw
the
snowy
in
its
place
looking
from
that
distance
at
least
as
good
as
new
the
indians
and
the
shepherds
and
laborers
of
all
sorts
were
coming
towards
the
chapel
the
senora
with
her
best
black
silk
handkerchief
bound
tight
around
her
forehead
the
ends
hanging
down
each
side
of
her
face
making
her
look
like
an
assyrian
priestess
was
descending
the
veranda
steps
felipe
at
her
side
and
father
salvierderra
had
already
entered
the
chapel
before
ramona
appeared
or
alessandro
stirred
from
his
of
observation
at
the
willows
when
ramona
came
out
from
the
door
she
bore
in
her
hands
a
high
silver
urn
filled
with
ferns
she
had
been
for
many
days
gathering
and
hoarding
these
they
were
hard
to
find
growing
only
in
one
place
in
a
rocky
canon
several
miles
away
as
she
stepped
from
the
veranda
to
the
ground
alessandro
walked
slowly
up
the
facing
her
she
met
his
eyes
and
without
knowing
why
thought
that
must
be
the
indian
who
as
she
turned
to
the
right
and
entered
the
chapel
alessandro
followed
her
hurriedly
and
knelt
on
the
stones
close
to
the
chapel
door
he
would
be
near
when
she
came
out
as
he
looked
in
at
the
door
he
saw
her
glide
up
the
aisle
place
the
ferns
on
the
and
then
kneel
down
by
felipe
in
front
of
the
altar
felipe
turned
towards
her
smiling
slightly
with
a
look
as
of
secret
intelligence
ah
senor
felipe
has
married
she
is
his
wife
thought
alessandro
and
a
strange
pain
seized
him
he
did
not
analyze
it
hardly
knew
what
it
meant
he
was
only
he
had
not
thought
much
about
women
he
was
a
distant
cold
boy
his
own
people
of
the
temecula
village
said
it
had
come
they
believed
of
learning
to
read
which
was
always
bad
chief
pablo
had
not
done
his
son
any
good
by
trying
to
make
him
like
white
men
if
the
fathers
could
have
stayed
and
the
life
at
the
mission
have
gone
on
why
alessandro
could
have
had
work
to
do
for
the
fathers
as
his
father
had
before
him
pablo
had
been
father
peyri
man
at
the
mission
had
kept
all
the
accounts
about
the
cattle
paid
the
wages
handled
thousands
of
dollars
of
gold
every
month
but
that
was
in
the
time
of
the
king
it
was
very
different
now
the
americans
would
not
let
an
indian
do
anything
but
plough
and
sow
and
herd
cattle
a
man
need
not
read
and
write
to
do
that
even
pablo
sometimes
doubted
whether
he
had
done
wisely
in
teaching
alessandro
all
he
knew
himself
pablo
was
for
one
of
his
race
wise
and
he
perceived
the
danger
threatening
his
people
on
all
sides
father
peyri
before
he
left
the
country
had
said
to
him
pablo
your
people
will
be
driven
like
sheep
to
the
slaughter
unless
you
keep
them
together
knit
firm
bonds
between
them
band
them
into
pueblos
make
them
work
and
above
all
keep
peace
with
the
whites
it
is
your
only
most
strenuously
pablo
had
striven
to
obey
father
peyri
directions
he
had
set
his
people
the
example
of
constant
industry
working
steadily
in
his
fields
and
caring
well
for
his
herds
he
had
built
a
chapel
in
his
little
village
and
kept
up
forms
of
religious
service
there
whenever
there
were
troubles
with
the
whites
or
rumors
of
them
he
went
from
house
to
house
urging
persuading
commanding
his
people
to
keep
the
peace
at
one
time
when
there
was
an
insurrection
of
some
of
the
indian
tribes
farther
south
and
for
a
few
days
it
looked
as
if
there
would
be
a
general
indian
war
he
removed
the
greater
part
of
his
band
men
women
and
children
driving
their
flocks
and
herds
with
them
to
los
angeles
and
camped
there
for
several
days
that
they
might
be
identified
with
the
whites
in
case
hostilities
became
serious
but
his
labors
did
not
receive
the
reward
that
they
deserved
with
every
day
that
the
intercourse
between
his
people
and
the
whites
increased
he
saw
the
whites
gaining
his
people
surely
losing
ground
and
his
anxieties
deepened
the
mexican
owner
of
the
temecula
valley
a
friend
of
father
peyri
and
a
good
friend
also
of
pablo
had
returned
to
mexico
in
disgust
with
the
state
of
affairs
in
california
and
was
reported
to
be
lying
at
the
point
of
death
this
man
promise
to
pablo
that
he
and
his
people
should
always
live
in
the
valley
undisturbed
was
all
the
title
pablo
had
to
the
village
lands
in
the
days
when
the
promise
was
given
it
was
all
that
was
necessary
the
lines
marking
off
the
indians
lands
were
surveyed
and
put
on
the
map
of
the
estate
no
mexican
proprietor
ever
broke
faith
with
an
indian
family
or
village
thus
placed
on
his
lands
but
pablo
had
heard
rumors
which
greatly
disquieted
him
that
such
pledges
and
surveyed
lines
as
these
were
corning
to
be
held
as
of
no
value
not
binding
on
purchasers
of
grants
he
was
intelligent
enough
to
see
that
if
this
were
so
he
and
his
people
were
ruined
all
these
perplexities
and
fears
he
confided
to
alessandro
long
anxious
hours
the
father
and
son
spent
together
walking
back
and
forth
in
the
village
or
sitting
in
front
of
their
little
adobe
house
discussing
what
could
be
done
there
was
always
the
same
ending
to
the
discussion
a
long
sigh
and
we
must
wait
we
can
do
no
wonder
alessandro
seemed
to
the
more
ignorant
and
thoughtless
young
men
and
women
of
his
village
a
cold
and
distant
lad
he
was
made
old
before
his
time
he
was
carrying
in
his
heart
burdens
of
which
they
knew
nothing
so
long
as
the
wheat
fields
came
up
well
and
there
was
no
drought
and
the
horses
and
sheep
had
good
pasture
in
plenty
on
the
hills
the
temecula
people
could
be
merry
go
day
by
day
to
their
easy
work
play
games
at
sunset
and
sleep
sound
all
night
but
alessandro
and
his
father
looked
beyond
and
this
was
the
one
great
reason
why
alessandro
had
not
yet
thought
about
women
in
way
of
love
this
and
also
the
fact
that
even
the
little
education
he
had
received
was
sufficient
to
raise
a
slight
barrier
of
which
he
was
unconsciously
aware
between
him
and
the
maidens
of
the
village
if
a
quick
warm
fancy
for
any
one
of
them
ever
stirred
in
his
veins
he
found
himself
soon
he
knew
not
how
cured
of
it
for
a
dance
or
a
game
or
a
friendly
chat
for
the
trips
into
the
mountains
after
acorns
or
to
the
marshes
for
grasses
and
reeds
he
was
their
good
comrade
and
they
were
his
but
never
had
the
desire
to
take
one
of
them
for
his
wife
entered
into
alessandro
mind
the
vista
of
the
future
for
him
was
filled
full
by
thoughts
which
left
no
room
for
love
dreaming
one
purpose
and
one
fear
filled
it
the
purpose
to
be
his
father
worthy
successor
for
pablo
was
old
now
and
very
feeble
the
fear
that
exile
and
ruin
were
in
store
for
them
all
it
was
of
these
things
he
had
been
thinking
as
be
walked
alone
in
advance
of
his
men
on
the
previous
night
when
he
first
saw
ramona
kneeling
at
the
brook
between
that
moment
and
the
present
it
seemed
to
alessandro
that
some
strange
miracle
must
have
happened
to
him
the
purposes
and
the
fears
had
alike
gone
a
face
replaced
them
a
vague
wonder
pain
joy
he
knew
not
what
filled
him
so
to
overflowing
that
he
was
bewildered
if
he
had
been
what
the
world
calls
a
civilized
man
he
would
have
known
instantly
and
would
have
been
capable
of
weighing
analyzing
and
reflecting
on
his
sensations
at
leisure
but
he
was
not
a
civilized
man
he
had
to
bring
to
bear
on
his
present
situation
only
simple
primitive
uneducated
instincts
and
impulses
if
ramona
had
been
a
maiden
of
his
own
people
or
race
he
would
have
drawn
near
to
her
as
quickly
as
iron
to
the
magnet
but
now
if
he
had
gone
so
far
as
to
even
think
of
her
in
such
a
way
she
would
have
been
to
his
view
as
far
removed
from
him
as
was
the
morning
star
beneath
whose
radiance
he
had
that
morning
watched
hoping
for
sight
of
her
at
her
window
he
did
not
however
go
so
far
as
to
thus
think
of
her
even
that
would
have
been
impossible
he
only
knelt
on
the
stones
outside
the
chapel
door
mechanically
repeating
the
prayers
with
the
rest
waiting
for
her
to
reappear
he
had
no
doubt
now
that
she
was
senor
felipe
wife
all
the
same
he
wished
to
kneel
there
till
she
came
out
that
he
might
see
her
face
again
his
vista
of
purpose
fear
hope
had
narrowed
now
down
to
that
just
one
more
sight
of
her
ever
so
civilized
he
could
hardly
have
worshipped
a
woman
better
the
mass
seemed
to
him
endlessly
long
until
near
the
last
he
forgot
to
sing
then
in
the
closing
of
the
final
hymn
he
suddenly
remembered
and
the
clear
voice
pealed
out
as
before
like
the
undertone
of
a
great
sweeping
along
ramona
heard
the
first
note
and
felt
again
the
same
thrill
she
was
as
much
a
musician
born
as
alessandro
himself
as
she
rose
from
her
knees
she
whispered
to
felipe
felipe
do
find
out
which
one
of
the
indians
it
is
has
that
superb
voice
i
never
heard
anything
like
oh
that
is
alessandro
replied
felipe
old
pablo
son
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
do
you
recollect
his
singing
two
years
ago
i
was
not
here
replied
ramona
you
ah
yes
so
you
were
away
i
had
forgotten
said
felipe
well
he
was
here
they
made
him
captain
of
the
though
he
was
only
twenty
and
he
managed
the
men
splendidly
they
saved
nearly
all
their
money
to
carry
home
and
i
never
knew
them
do
such
a
thing
before
father
salvierderra
was
here
which
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
think
it
was
quite
as
much
alessandro
he
plays
the
violin
beautifully
i
hope
he
has
brought
it
along
he
plays
the
old
san
luis
rey
music
his
father
was
ramona
eyes
kindled
with
pleasure
does
your
mother
like
it
to
have
him
play
she
asked
felipe
nodded
we
have
him
up
on
the
veranda
tonight
he
said
while
this
whispered
colloquy
was
going
on
the
chapel
had
emptied
the
indians
and
mexicans
all
hurrying
out
to
set
about
the
day
work
alessandro
lingered
at
the
doorway
as
long
as
he
dared
till
he
was
sharply
called
by
juan
canito
looking
back
what
are
you
gaping
at
there
you
alessandro
hurry
now
and
get
your
men
to
work
after
waiting
till
near
midsummer
for
this
shearing
we
make
as
quick
work
of
it
as
we
can
have
you
got
your
best
shearers
here
ay
that
i
have
answered
alessandro
not
a
man
of
them
but
can
shear
his
hundred
in
a
day
there
is
not
such
a
band
as
ours
in
all
san
diego
county
and
we
do
turn
out
the
sheep
all
bleeding
either
you
see
scarce
a
scratch
on
their
retorted
juan
can
is
a
poor
shearer
indeed
that
draws
blood
to
speak
of
i
sheared
many
a
thousand
sheep
in
my
day
and
never
a
red
stain
on
the
shears
but
the
mexicans
have
always
been
famed
for
good
juan
invidious
emphasis
on
the
word
mexicans
did
not
escape
alessandro
and
we
indians
also
he
answered
betraying
no
annoyance
but
as
for
these
americans
i
saw
one
at
work
the
other
day
that
man
lomax
who
settled
near
temecula
and
upon
my
faith
juan
can
i
thought
it
was
a
and
not
a
shearing
the
poor
beasts
limped
off
with
the
blood
juan
did
not
see
his
way
clear
at
the
moment
to
any
fitting
rejoinder
to
this
easy
assumption
on
alessandro
part
of
the
equal
superiority
of
indians
and
mexicans
in
the
art
so
much
vexed
with
another
humph
he
walked
away
walked
away
so
fast
that
he
lost
the
sight
of
a
smile
on
alessandro
face
which
would
have
vexed
him
still
further
at
the
sheds
and
pens
all
was
stir
and
bustle
the
shearing
shed
was
a
huge
caricature
of
a
summerhouse
a
long
narrow
structure
sixty
feet
long
by
twenty
or
thirty
wide
all
roof
and
pillars
no
walls
the
supports
slender
rough
posts
as
far
apart
as
was
safe
for
the
upholding
of
the
roof
which
was
of
rough
planks
loosely
laid
from
beam
to
beam
on
three
sides
of
this
were
the
filled
with
sheep
and
lambs
a
few
rods
away
stood
the
booths
in
which
the
shearers
food
was
to
be
cooked
and
the
shearers
fed
these
were
mere
temporary
affairs
roofed
only
by
willow
boughs
with
the
leaves
left
on
near
these
the
indians
had
already
arranged
their
camp
a
hut
or
two
of
green
boughs
had
been
built
but
for
the
most
part
they
would
sleep
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
on
the
ground
there
was
a
brisk
wind
and
the
gay
colored
wings
of
the
windmill
blew
furiously
round
and
round
pumping
out
into
the
tank
below
a
stream
of
water
so
swift
and
strong
that
as
the
men
crowded
around
wetting
and
sharpening
their
knives
they
got
well
spattered
and
had
much
merriment
pushing
and
elbowing
each
other
into
the
spray
a
high
frame
stood
close
to
the
shed
in
this
swung
from
the
four
corners
hung
one
of
the
great
sacking
bags
in
which
the
fleeces
were
to
be
packed
a
big
pile
of
bags
lay
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
posts
juan
can
eyed
them
with
a
chuckle
we
fill
more
than
those
before
night
senor
felipe
he
said
he
was
in
his
element
juan
can
at
shearing
times
then
came
his
reward
for
the
somewhat
monotonous
and
stupid
year
work
the
world
held
no
better
feast
for
his
eyes
than
the
sight
of
a
long
row
of
big
bales
of
fleece
tied
stamped
with
the
moreno
brand
ready
to
be
drawn
away
to
the
mills
now
there
is
something
substantial
he
thought
no
chance
of
wool
going
amiss
in
market
if
a
year
crop
were
good
juan
happiness
was
assured
for
the
next
six
months
if
it
proved
poor
he
turned
devout
immediately
and
spent
the
next
six
months
calling
on
the
saints
for
better
luck
and
redoubling
his
exertions
with
the
sheep
on
one
of
the
posts
of
the
shed
short
projecting
slats
were
nailed
like
of
a
ladder
lightly
as
a
felipe
ran
up
these
to
the
roof
and
took
his
stand
there
ready
to
take
the
fleeces
and
pack
them
in
the
bag
as
fast
as
they
should
be
tossed
up
from
below
luigo
with
a
big
leathern
wallet
fastened
in
front
of
him
filled
with
pieces
took
his
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
shed
the
thirty
shearers
running
into
the
nearest
pen
dragged
each
his
sheep
into
the
shed
in
a
twinkling
of
an
eye
had
the
creature
between
his
knees
helpless
immovable
and
the
sharp
sound
of
the
shears
set
in
the
had
begun
no
rest
now
not
a
second
silence
from
the
bleating
opening
and
shutting
clicking
sharpening
of
shears
flying
of
fleeces
through
the
air
to
the
roof
pressing
and
stamping
them
down
in
the
bales
not
a
second
intermission
except
the
hour
of
rest
at
noon
from
sunrise
till
sunset
till
the
whole
eight
thousand
of
the
senora
moreno
sheep
were
shorn
it
was
a
dramatic
spectacle
as
soon
as
a
sheep
was
shorn
the
shearer
ran
with
the
fleece
in
his
hand
to
luigo
threw
it
down
on
a
table
received
his
piece
dropped
it
in
his
pocket
ran
to
the
pen
dragged
out
another
sheep
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
was
back
again
with
a
second
fleece
the
shorn
sheep
released
bounded
off
into
another
pen
where
light
in
the
head
no
doubt
from
being
three
to
five
pounds
lighter
on
their
legs
they
trotted
round
bewilderedly
for
a
moment
then
flung
up
their
heels
and
capered
for
joy
it
was
warm
work
the
dust
from
the
fleeces
and
the
trampling
feet
filled
the
air
as
the
sun
rose
higher
in
the
sky
the
sweat
poured
off
the
men
faces
and
felipe
standing
without
shelter
on
the
roof
found
out
very
soon
that
he
had
by
no
means
yet
got
back
his
full
strength
since
the
fever
long
before
noon
except
for
sheer
pride
and
for
the
recollection
of
juan
canito
speech
he
would
have
come
down
and
yielded
his
place
to
the
old
man
but
he
was
resolved
not
to
give
up
and
he
worked
on
though
his
face
was
purple
and
his
head
throbbing
after
the
bag
of
fleeces
is
half
full
the
packer
stands
in
it
jumping
with
his
full
weight
on
the
wool
as
he
throws
in
the
fleeces
to
compress
them
as
much
as
possible
when
felipe
began
to
do
this
he
found
that
he
had
indeed
overrated
his
strength
as
the
first
cloud
of
the
sickening
dust
came
up
enveloping
his
head
choking
his
breath
he
turned
suddenly
dizzy
and
calling
faintly
juan
i
am
ill
sank
helpless
down
in
the
wool
he
had
fainted
at
juan
canito
scream
of
dismay
a
great
hubbub
and
outcry
arose
all
saw
instantly
what
had
happened
felipe
head
was
hanging
limp
over
the
edge
of
the
bag
juan
in
vain
endeavoring
to
get
sufficient
foothold
by
his
side
to
lift
him
one
after
another
the
men
rushed
up
the
ladder
until
they
were
all
standing
a
helpless
excited
crowd
on
the
roof
one
proposing
one
thing
one
another
only
luigo
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
run
to
the
house
for
help
the
senora
was
away
from
home
she
had
gone
with
father
salvierderra
to
a
friend
house
a
journey
off
but
ramona
was
there
snatching
all
she
could
think
of
in
way
of
restoratives
she
came
flying
back
with
luigo
followed
by
every
servant
of
the
establishment
all
talking
groaning
gesticulating
suggesting
wringing
their
hands
as
disheartening
a
babel
as
ever
made
bad
matters
worse
reaching
the
shed
ramona
looked
up
to
the
roof
bewildered
where
is
he
she
cried
the
next
instant
she
saw
his
head
held
in
juan
arms
just
above
the
edge
of
the
she
groaned
oh
how
will
he
ever
be
lifted
out
i
will
lift
him
senora
cried
alessandro
coming
to
the
front
i
am
very
strong
do
not
be
afraid
i
will
bring
him
safe
and
swinging
himself
down
the
ladder
he
ran
swiftly
to
the
camp
and
returned
bringing
in
his
hands
blankets
springing
quickly
to
the
roof
again
he
knotted
the
blankets
firmly
together
and
tying
them
at
the
middle
around
his
waist
threw
the
ends
to
his
men
telling
them
to
hold
him
firm
he
spoke
in
the
indian
tongue
as
he
was
hurriedly
doing
this
and
ramona
did
not
at
first
understand
his
plan
but
when
she
saw
the
indians
move
a
little
back
from
the
edge
of
the
roof
holding
the
blankets
firm
grasped
while
alessandro
stepped
out
on
one
of
the
narrow
from
which
the
bag
swung
she
saw
what
he
meant
to
do
she
held
her
breath
felipe
was
a
slender
man
alessandro
was
much
heavier
and
many
inches
taller
still
could
any
man
carry
such
a
burden
safely
on
that
narrow
beam
ramona
looked
away
and
shut
her
eyes
through
the
silence
which
followed
it
was
only
a
few
moments
but
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
a
glad
murmur
of
voices
told
her
that
it
was
done
and
looking
up
she
saw
felipe
lying
on
the
roof
unconscious
his
face
white
his
eyes
shut
at
this
sight
all
the
servants
broke
out
afresh
weeping
and
wailing
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
ramona
stood
motionless
her
eyes
fixed
on
felipe
face
she
too
believed
him
dead
but
her
thought
was
of
the
senora
he
is
not
dead
cried
juan
canito
who
had
thrust
his
hand
under
felipe
shirt
he
is
not
dead
it
is
only
a
at
this
the
first
tears
rolled
down
ramona
face
she
looked
piteously
at
the
ladder
up
and
down
which
she
had
seen
alessandro
run
as
if
it
were
an
easy
indoor
staircase
if
i
could
only
get
up
there
she
said
looking
from
one
to
another
i
think
i
can
and
she
put
one
foot
on
the
lower
round
holy
virgin
cried
juan
can
seeing
her
movement
senorita
senorita
do
not
attempt
it
it
is
not
too
easy
for
a
man
you
will
break
your
neck
he
is
fast
coming
to
his
alessandro
caught
the
words
spite
of
all
the
confusion
and
terror
of
the
scene
his
heart
heard
the
word
ramona
was
not
the
wife
of
felipe
or
of
any
man
yet
alessandro
recollected
that
he
had
addressed
her
as
senora
and
she
did
not
seem
surprised
coming
to
the
front
of
the
group
he
said
bending
forward
senorita
there
must
have
been
something
in
the
tone
which
made
ramona
start
the
simple
word
could
not
have
done
it
senorita
said
alessandro
it
will
be
nothing
to
bring
senor
felipe
down
the
ladder
he
is
in
my
arms
no
more
than
one
of
the
lambs
yonder
i
will
bring
him
down
as
soon
as
he
is
recovered
he
is
better
here
till
then
he
will
very
soon
be
himself
again
it
was
only
the
seeing
that
the
expression
of
anxious
distress
did
not
grow
less
on
ramona
face
he
continued
in
a
tone
still
more
earnest
will
not
the
senorita
trust
me
to
bring
him
safe
down
ramona
smiled
faintly
through
her
tears
yes
she
said
i
will
trust
you
you
are
alessandro
are
you
not
yes
senorita
he
answered
greatly
surprised
i
am
vi
a
bad
beginning
did
not
make
a
good
ending
of
the
senora
this
year
one
as
superstitiously
prejudiced
against
roman
catholic
rule
as
she
was
in
favor
of
it
would
have
found
in
the
way
things
fell
out
ample
reason
for
a
belief
that
the
senora
was
being
punished
for
having
let
all
the
affairs
of
her
place
come
to
a
standstill
to
await
the
coming
of
an
old
monk
but
the
pious
senora
looking
at
the
other
side
of
the
shield
was
filled
with
gratitude
that
since
all
this
ill
luck
was
to
befall
her
she
had
the
good
father
salvierderra
at
her
side
to
give
her
comfort
and
counsel
it
was
not
yet
quite
noon
of
the
first
day
when
felipe
fainted
and
fell
in
the
wool
and
it
was
only
a
little
past
noon
of
the
third
when
juan
canito
who
not
without
some
secret
exultation
had
taken
senor
felipe
place
at
the
packing
fell
from
the
to
the
ground
and
broke
his
right
leg
a
bad
break
near
the
knee
and
juan
bones
were
much
too
old
for
fresh
knitting
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
do
more
than
hobble
about
on
crutches
dragging
along
the
useless
leg
it
was
a
cruel
blow
to
the
old
man
he
could
not
be
resigned
to
it
he
lost
faith
in
his
saints
and
privately
indulged
in
blasphemous
beratings
and
reproaches
of
them
which
would
have
filled
the
senora
with
terror
had
she
known
that
such
blasphemies
were
being
committed
under
her
roof
as
many
times
as
i
have
crossed
that
plank
in
my
day
cried
juan
only
the
fiends
themselves
could
have
made
me
trip
and
there
was
that
whole
box
of
candles
i
paid
for
with
my
own
money
last
month
and
burned
to
saint
francis
in
the
chapel
for
this
very
he
may
sit
in
the
dark
for
all
me
to
the
end
of
time
he
is
no
saint
at
all
what
are
they
for
if
not
to
keep
us
from
harm
when
we
pray
to
them
pray
no
more
i
believe
the
americans
are
right
who
laugh
at
from
morning
till
night
and
nearly
from
night
till
morning
for
the
leg
ached
so
he
slept
little
poor
juan
groaned
and
grumbled
and
swore
and
swore
and
grumbled
and
groaned
taking
care
of
him
was
enough
margarita
said
to
wear
out
the
patience
of
the
madonna
herself
there
was
no
pleasing
him
whatever
you
did
and
his
tongue
was
never
still
a
minute
for
her
part
she
believed
that
it
must
be
as
he
said
that
the
fiends
had
pushed
him
off
the
plank
and
that
the
saints
had
had
their
reasons
for
leaving
him
to
his
fate
a
coldness
and
suspicion
gradually
grew
up
in
the
minds
of
all
the
servants
towards
him
his
own
reckless
language
combined
with
margarita
reports
gave
the
superstitious
fair
ground
for
believing
that
something
had
gone
mysteriously
wrong
and
that
the
devil
was
in
a
fair
way
to
get
his
soul
which
was
very
hard
for
the
old
man
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
he
had
to
bear
the
only
alleviation
he
had
for
his
torments
was
in
having
his
men
and
women
drop
in
sit
by
his
pallet
and
chat
with
him
telling
him
all
that
was
going
on
and
when
by
degrees
they
dropped
off
coming
more
and
more
seldom
and
one
by
one
leaving
off
coming
altogether
it
was
the
one
drop
that
overflowed
his
cup
of
misery
and
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
left
off
grumbling
and
spoke
only
when
he
must
this
phase
frightened
margarita
even
more
than
the
first
now
she
thought
surely
the
dumb
terror
and
remorse
of
one
who
belongs
to
the
devil
had
seized
him
and
her
hands
trembled
as
she
went
through
the
needful
ministrations
for
him
each
day
three
months
at
least
the
doctor
who
had
come
from
ventura
to
set
the
leg
had
said
he
must
lie
still
in
bed
and
be
thus
tended
three
months
sighed
margarita
if
i
be
not
dead
or
gone
crazy
myself
before
the
end
of
that
be
come
the
senora
was
too
busy
with
felipe
to
pay
attention
or
to
give
thought
to
juan
felipe
fainting
had
been
the
symptom
and
beginning
of
a
fierce
relapse
of
the
fever
and
he
was
lying
in
his
bed
tossing
and
raving
in
delirium
always
about
the
wool
throw
them
faster
faster
that
a
good
fleece
five
pounds
more
a
round
ton
in
those
bales
juan
alessandro
captain
jesus
how
this
sun
burns
my
head
several
times
he
had
called
alessandro
so
earnestly
that
father
salvierderra
advised
bringing
alessandro
into
the
room
to
see
if
by
any
chance
there
might
have
been
something
in
his
mind
that
he
wished
to
say
to
him
but
when
alessandro
stood
by
the
bedside
felipe
gazed
at
him
vacantly
as
he
did
at
all
the
others
still
repeating
however
alessandro
alessandro
i
think
perhaps
he
wants
alessandro
to
play
on
his
violin
sobbed
out
ramona
he
was
telling
me
how
beautifully
alessandro
played
and
said
he
would
have
him
up
on
the
veranda
in
the
evening
to
play
to
we
might
try
it
said
father
salvierderra
have
you
your
violin
here
alessandro
alas
no
father
replied
alessandro
i
did
not
bring
perhaps
it
would
do
him
good
it
you
were
to
sing
then
said
ramona
he
was
speaking
of
your
voice
oh
try
said
the
senorita
turning
to
alessandro
sing
something
low
and
alessandro
walked
from
the
bed
to
the
open
window
and
after
thinking
for
a
moment
began
a
slow
strain
from
one
of
the
masses
at
the
first
note
felipe
became
suddenly
quiet
evidently
listening
an
expression
of
pleasure
spread
over
his
feverish
face
he
turned
his
head
to
one
side
put
his
hand
under
his
cheek
and
closed
his
eyes
the
three
watching
him
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
it
is
a
miracle
said
father
salvierderra
he
will
it
was
what
he
wanted
whispered
ramona
the
senora
spoke
not
but
buried
her
face
in
the
bedclothes
for
a
second
then
lifting
it
she
gazed
at
alessandro
as
if
she
were
praying
to
a
saint
he
too
saw
the
change
in
felipe
and
sang
lower
and
lower
till
the
notes
sounded
as
if
they
came
from
afar
lower
and
lower
slower
finally
they
ceased
as
if
they
died
away
lost
in
distance
as
they
ceased
felipe
opened
his
eyes
oh
go
on
go
on
the
senora
implored
in
a
whisper
shrill
with
anxiety
do
not
stop
alessandro
repeated
the
strain
slow
solemn
his
voice
trembled
the
air
in
the
room
seemed
stifling
spite
of
the
open
window
he
felt
something
like
terror
as
he
saw
felipe
evidently
sinking
to
sleep
by
reason
of
the
notes
of
his
voice
there
had
been
nothing
in
healthy
outdoor
experience
to
enable
him
to
understand
such
a
phenomenon
felipe
breathed
more
and
more
slowly
softly
regularly
soon
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
the
singing
stopped
felipe
did
not
stir
can
i
go
whispered
alessandro
no
replied
the
senora
impatiently
he
may
wake
any
alessandro
looked
troubled
but
bowed
his
head
submissively
and
remained
standing
by
the
window
father
salvierderra
was
kneeling
on
one
side
of
the
bed
the
senora
at
the
other
ramona
at
the
foot
all
praying
the
silence
was
so
great
that
the
slight
sounds
of
the
rosary
beads
slipping
against
each
other
seemed
loud
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
at
the
head
of
the
bed
stood
a
statue
of
the
madonna
on
the
other
side
a
picture
of
santa
barbara
candles
were
burning
before
each
the
long
wicks
smouldered
and
died
down
sputtering
then
flared
up
again
as
the
ends
fell
into
the
melted
wax
the
senora
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
madonna
the
father
were
closed
ramona
gazed
at
felipe
with
tears
streaming
down
her
face
as
she
mechanically
told
her
beads
she
is
his
betrothed
no
doubt
thought
alessandro
the
saints
will
not
let
him
die
and
alessandro
also
prayed
but
the
oppression
of
the
scene
was
too
much
for
him
laying
his
hand
on
the
low
he
vaulted
over
it
saying
to
ramona
who
turned
her
head
at
the
sound
i
will
not
go
away
senorita
i
will
be
close
under
the
window
if
he
once
in
the
open
air
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
gazed
bewilderedly
about
him
like
one
just
recovering
consciousness
after
a
faint
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
under
the
window
and
lay
looking
up
into
the
sky
capitan
came
up
and
with
a
low
whine
stretched
himself
out
at
full
length
by
his
side
the
dog
knew
as
well
as
any
other
one
of
the
house
that
danger
and
anguish
were
there
one
hour
passed
two
three
still
no
sound
from
felipe
room
alessandro
rose
and
looked
in
at
the
window
the
father
and
the
senora
had
not
changed
their
attitudes
their
lips
were
yet
moving
in
prayer
but
ramona
had
yielded
to
her
fatigue
slipped
from
her
knees
into
a
sitting
posture
with
her
head
leaning
against
the
post
of
the
bedstead
and
fallen
asleep
her
face
was
swollen
and
discolored
by
weeping
and
heavy
circles
under
her
eyes
told
how
tired
she
was
for
three
days
and
nights
she
had
scarcely
rested
so
constant
were
the
demands
on
her
between
felipe
illness
and
juan
can
there
was
not
a
moment
without
something
to
be
done
or
some
perplexing
question
to
be
settled
and
above
all
and
through
all
the
terrible
sorrow
ramona
was
broken
down
with
grief
at
the
thought
of
felipe
death
she
had
never
known
till
she
saw
him
lying
there
delirious
and
as
she
in
her
inexperience
thought
dying
how
her
whole
life
was
entwined
with
his
but
now
at
the
very
thought
of
what
it
would
be
to
live
without
him
her
heart
sickened
when
he
is
buried
i
will
ask
father
salvierderra
to
take
me
away
i
never
can
live
here
alone
she
said
to
herself
never
for
a
moment
perceiving
that
the
word
alone
was
a
strange
one
to
have
come
into
her
mind
in
the
connection
the
thought
of
the
senora
did
not
enter
into
her
imaginations
of
the
future
which
so
smote
her
with
terror
in
the
senora
presence
ramona
always
felt
herself
alone
alessandro
stood
at
the
window
his
arms
folded
leaning
on
the
sill
his
eyes
fixed
on
ramona
face
and
form
to
any
other
than
a
eyes
she
had
not
looked
beautiful
now
but
to
alessandro
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
the
picture
of
santa
barbara
on
the
wall
beyond
with
a
lover
instinct
he
knew
the
thoughts
which
had
written
such
lines
on
her
face
in
the
last
three
days
it
will
kill
her
if
he
dies
he
thought
if
these
three
days
have
made
her
look
like
and
alessandro
threw
himself
on
the
ground
again
his
face
down
he
did
not
know
whether
it
were
an
hour
or
a
day
that
he
had
lain
there
when
he
heard
father
salvierderra
voice
speaking
his
name
he
sprang
up
to
see
the
old
monk
standing
in
the
window
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
god
be
praised
he
said
the
senor
felipe
will
get
well
a
sweat
has
broken
out
on
his
skin
he
still
sleeps
but
when
he
wakes
he
will
be
in
his
right
mind
the
strength
of
the
fever
is
broken
but
alessandro
we
know
not
how
to
spare
you
can
you
not
let
the
men
go
without
you
and
remain
here
the
senora
would
like
to
have
you
remain
in
juan
place
till
he
is
about
she
will
give
you
the
same
wages
he
had
would
it
not
be
a
good
thing
for
you
alessandro
you
can
not
be
sure
of
earning
so
much
as
that
for
the
next
three
months
can
you
while
the
father
was
speaking
a
tumult
had
been
going
on
in
alessandro
breast
he
did
not
know
by
name
any
of
the
impulses
which
were
warring
there
tearing
him
in
twain
as
it
were
by
their
pulling
in
opposite
directions
one
saying
stay
and
the
other
saying
go
he
would
not
have
known
what
any
one
meant
who
had
said
to
him
it
is
danger
to
stay
it
is
safety
to
all
the
same
he
felt
as
if
he
could
do
neither
there
is
another
shearing
yet
father
he
began
at
the
ranch
i
had
promised
to
go
to
them
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
here
and
they
have
been
wroth
enough
with
us
for
the
delay
already
it
will
not
do
to
break
the
promise
father
salvierderra
face
fell
no
my
son
certainly
not
he
said
but
could
no
one
else
take
your
place
with
the
band
hearing
these
words
ramona
came
to
the
window
and
leaning
out
whispered
are
you
talking
about
alessandro
staying
let
me
come
and
talk
to
him
he
must
not
and
running
swiftly
through
the
hall
across
the
veranda
and
down
the
steps
she
stood
by
alessandro
side
in
a
moment
looking
up
in
his
face
pleadingly
she
said
we
ca
let
you
go
alessandro
the
senor
will
pay
wages
to
some
other
to
go
in
your
place
with
the
shearers
we
want
you
to
stay
here
in
juan

place
till
he
is
well
do
say
you
ca

felipe
may
need
you
to
sing
again
and
what
would
we
do
then
ca
you

yes
i
can
stay
senorita
answered
alessandro
gravely
i
will
stay
so
long
as
you
need
oh
thank
you
alessandro
ramona
cried
you
are
good
to
stay
the
senora
will
see
that
it
is
no
loss
to
you
and
she
flew
back
to
the
house
it
is
not
for
the
wages
senorita
alessandro
began
but
ramona
was
gone
she
did
not
hear
him
and
he
turned
away
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
i
do
want
the
senorita
to
think
that
it
was
the
money
kept
me
he
said
turning
to
father
salvierderra
i
would
not
leave
the
band
for
money
it
is
to
help
because
they
are
in
trouble
yes
yes
son
i
understand
that
replied
the
monk
who
had
known
alessandro
since
he
was
a
little
fellow
playing
in
the
corridors
of
san
luis
rey
the
pet
of
all
the
brothers
there
that
is
quite
right
of
you
and
the
senora
will
not
be
insensible
of
it
it
is
not
for
such
things
that
money
can
pay
they
are
indeed
in
great
trouble
now
and
only
the
two
women
in
the
house
and
i
must
soon
be
going
on
my
way
north
is
it
sure
that
senor
felipe
will
get
well
asked
alessandro
i
think
so
replied
father
salvierderra
these
relapses
are
always
worse
than
the
first
attack
but
i
have
never
known
one
to
die
after
he
had
the
natural
sweat
to
break
from
the
skin
and
got
good
sleep
i
doubt
not
he
will
be
in
his
bed
though
for
many
days
and
there
will
be
much
to
be
seen
to
it
was
an
ill
luck
to
have
juan
can
laid
up
too
just
at
this
time
i
must
go
and
see
him
i
hear
he
is
in
most
rebellious
frame
of
mind
and
blasphemes
that
does
he
said
alessandro
he
swears
the
saints
gave
him
over
to
the
fiends
to
push
him
off
the
plank
and
he
have
none
of
them
from
this
out
i
told
him
to
beware
or
they
might
bring
him
to
worse
things
yet
if
he
did
not
mend
his
speech
of
sighing
deeply
as
they
walked
along
the
monk
said
it
is
but
a
sign
of
the
times
blasphemers
are
on
the
highway
the
people
are
being
corrupted
keeps
your
father
the
worship
in
the
chapel
still
and
does
a
priest
come
often
to
the
village
only
twice
a
year
replied
alessandro
and
sometimes
for
a
funeral
if
there
is
money
enough
to
pay
for
the
mass
but
my
father
has
the
chapel
open
and
each
sunday
we
sing
what
we
know
of
the
mass
and
the
people
are
often
there
ay
ay
ever
for
money
groaned
father
salvierderra
not
heeding
the
latter
part
of
the
sentence
ever
for
money
it
is
a
shame
but
that
it
were
sure
to
be
held
as
a
trespass
i
would
go
myself
to
temecula
once
in
three
months
but
i
may
not
the
priests
do
not
love
our
oh
if
you
could
father
exclaimed
alessandro
it
would
make
my
father
very
glad
he
speaks
often
to
me
of
the
difference
he
sees
between
the
words
of
the
church
now
and
in
the
days
of
the
mission
he
is
very
sad
father
and
in
great
fear
about
our
village
they
say
the
americans
when
they
buy
the
mexicans
lands
drive
the
indians
away
as
if
they
were
dogs
they
say
we
have
no
right
to
our
lands
do
you
think
that
can
be
so
father
when
we
have
always
lived
on
them
and
the
owners
promised
them
to
us
forever
father
salvierderra
was
silent
a
long
time
before
replying
and
alessandro
watched
his
face
anxiously
he
seemed
to
be
hesitating
for
words
to
convey
his
meaning
at
last
he
said
got
your
father
any
notice
at
any
time
since
the
americans
took
the
country
notice
to
appear
before
a
court
or
anything
about
a
title
to
the
land
no
father
replied
alessandro
there
has
to
be
some
such
paper
as
i
understand
their
laws
continued
the
monk
some
notice
before
any
steps
can
be
taken
to
remove
indians
from
an
estate
it
must
be
done
according
to
the
law
in
the
courts
if
you
have
had
no
such
notice
you
are
not
in
but
father
persisted
alessandro
how
could
there
be
a
law
to
take
away
from
us
the
land
which
the
senor
valdez
gave
us
forever
gave
he
to
you
any
paper
any
writing
to
show
it
no
no
paper
but
it
is
marked
in
red
lines
on
the
map
it
was
marked
off
by
jose
ramirez
of
los
angeles
when
they
marked
all
the
boundaries
of
senor
valdez
estate
they
had
many
instruments
of
brass
and
wood
to
measure
with
and
a
long
chain
very
heavy
which
i
helped
them
carry
i
myself
saw
it
marked
on
the
map
they
all
slept
in
my
house
senor
valdez
and
ramirez
and
the
man
who
made
the
measures
he
hired
one
of
our
men
to
carry
his
instruments
and
i
went
to
help
for
i
wished
to
see
how
it
was
done
but
i
could
understand
nothing
and
jose
told
me
a
man
must
study
many
years
to
learn
the
way
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
our
way
by
the
stones
was
much
better
but
i
know
it
is
all
marked
on
the
map
for
it
was
with
a
red
line
and
my
father
understood
it
and
jose
ramirez
and
senor
valdez
both
pointed
to
it
with
their
finger
and
they
said
this
here
is
your
land
pablo
always
i
do
not
think
my
father
need
fear
do
you
i
hope
not
replied
father
salvierderra
cautiously
but
since
the
way
that
all
the
lands
of
the
missions
have
been
taken
away
i
have
small
faith
in
the
honesty
of
the
americans
i
think
they
will
take
all
that
they
can
the
church
has
suffered
terrible
loss
at
their
that
is
what
my
father
says
replied
alessandro
he
says
at
san
luis
rey
nothing
but
the
garden
and
orchard
left
of
all
their
vast
lands
where
they
used
to
pasture
thirty
thousand
sheep
if
the
church
and
the
fathers
could
not
keep
their
lands
what
can
we
indians
do
that
is
what
my
father
true
true
said
the
monk
as
he
turned
into
the
door
of
the
room
where
juan
can
lay
on
his
narrow
bed
longing
yet
fearing
to
see
father
salvierderra
face
coming
in
we
are
all
alike
helpless
in
their
hands
alessandro
they
possess
the
country
and
can
make
what
laws
they
please
we
can
only
say
will
be
done
and
he
crossed
himself
devoutly
repeating
the
words
twice
alessandro
did
the
same
and
with
a
truly
devout
spirit
for
he
was
full
of
veneration
for
the
fathers
and
their
teachings
but
as
he
walked
on
towards
the
he
thought
then
again
how
can
it
be
will
that
wrong
be
done
it
can
not
be
god
will
that
one
man
should
steal
from
another
all
he
has
that
would
make
god
no
better
than
a
thief
it
looks
to
me
but
how
can
it
happen
if
it
is
not
god
will
it
does
not
need
that
one
be
educated
to
see
the
logic
in
this
formula
generations
of
the
oppressed
and
despoiled
before
alessandro
had
grappled
with
the
problem
in
one
shape
or
another
at
the
alessandro
found
his
men
in
confusion
and
the
shearing
had
been
over
and
done
by
ten
in
the
morning
and
why
were
they
not
on
their
way
to
the
ortega
waiting
all
day
it
was
now
near
sunset
with
nothing
to
do
and
still
worse
with
not
much
of
anything
to
eat
had
made
them
all
cross
and
no
wonder
the
economical
juan
can
finding
that
the
work
would
be
done
by
ten
and
supposing
they
would
be
off
before
noon
had
ordered
only
two
sheep
killed
for
them
the
day
before
and
the
mutton
was
all
gone
and
old
marda
getting
her
cue
from
juan
had
cooked
no
more
frijoles
than
the
family
needed
themselves
so
the
poor
shearers
had
indeed
had
a
sorry
day
of
it
in
no
wise
alleviated
either
by
the
reports
brought
from
time
to
time
that
their
captain
was
lying
on
the
ground
face
down
under
senor
felipe
window
and
must
not
be
spoken
to
it
was
not
a
propitious
moment
for
alessandro
to
make
the
announcement
of
his
purpose
to
leave
the
band
but
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
in
few
words
and
diplomatically
diverted
all
resentment
from
himself
by
setting
them
immediately
to
voting
for
a
new
captain
to
take
his
place
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
very
well
they
said
hotly
captain
for
this
year
captain
for
next
too
it
was
so
easy
to
step
out
and
in
again
of
the
captaincy
of
the
shearers
all
right
said
alessandro
please
yourselves
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
but
here
i
am
going
to
stay
for
the
present
father
salvierderra
wishes
oh
if
the
father
wishes
it
that
is
ah
that
alters
the
case
alessandro
is
right
came
up
in
confused
murmur
from
the
appeased
crowd
they
were
all
good
catholics
every
one
of
the
temecula
men
and
would
never
think
of
going
against
the
father
orders
but
when
they
understood
that
alessandro
intention
was
to
remain
until
juan
canito
leg
should
be
well
enough
for
him
to
go
about
again
fresh
grumblings
began
that
would
not
do
it
would
be
all
summer
alessandro
must
be
at
home
for
the
saint
juan
day
fete
in
midsummer
no
doing
anything
without
alessandro
then
what
was
he
thinking
of
not
of
the
midsummer
fete
that
was
certain
when
he
promised
to
stay
as
long
as
the
senorita
ramona
should
need
him
alessandro
had
remembered
nothing
except
the
senorita
voice
while
she
was
speaking
to
him
if
he
had
had
a
hundred
engagements
for
the
summer
he
would
have
forgotten
them
all
now
that
he
was
reminded
of
the
midsummer
fete
it
must
be
confessed
he
was
for
a
moment
dismayed
at
the
recollection
for
that
was
a
time
when
as
he
well
knew
his
father
could
not
do
without
his
help
there
were
sometimes
a
thousand
indians
at
this
fete
and
disorderly
whites
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
sell
whisky
and
encourage
all
sorts
of
license
and
disturbance
yes
alessandro
clear
path
of
duty
lay
at
temecula
when
that
fete
came
off
that
was
certain
i
will
manage
to
be
at
home
then
he
said
if
i
am
not
through
here
by
that
time
i
will
at
least
come
for
the
fete
that
you
may
depend
the
voting
for
the
new
captain
did
not
take
long
there
was
in
fact
but
one
man
in
the
band
fit
for
the
office
that
was
fernando
the
only
old
man
in
the
band
all
the
rest
were
young
men
under
thirty
or
boys
fernando
had
been
captain
for
several
years
but
had
himself
begged
two
years
ago
that
the
band
would
elect
alessandro
in
his
place
he
was
getting
old
and
he
did
not
like
to
have
to
sit
up
and
walk
about
the
first
half
of
every
night
to
see
that
the
shearers
were
not
gambling
away
all
their
money
at
cards
he
preferred
to
roll
himself
up
in
his
blanket
at
sunset
and
sleep
till
dawn
the
next
morning
but
just
for
these
few
remaining
weeks
he
had
no
objection
to
taking
the
office
again
and
alessandro
was
right
entirely
right
in
remaining
they
ought
all
to
see
that
fernando
said
and
his
word
had
great
weight
with
the
men
the
senora
moreno
he
reminded
them
had
always
been
a
good
friend
of
theirs
and
had
said
that
so
long
as
she
had
sheep
to
shear
the
temecula
shearers
should
do
it
and
it
would
be
very
ungrateful
now
if
they
did
not
do
all
they
could
to
help
her
in
her
need
the
blankets
were
rolled
up
the
saddles
collected
the
ponies
caught
and
driven
up
to
the
shed
when
ramona
and
margarita
were
seen
coming
at
full
speed
from
the
house
alessandro
alessandro
cried
ramona
out
of
breath
i
have
only
just
now
heard
that
the
men
have
had
no
dinner
i
am
ashamed
but
you
know
it
would
not
have
happened
except
for
the
sickness
in
the
house
everybody
thought
they
were
going
away
this
morning
now
they
must
have
a
good
supper
before
they
go
it
is
already
cooking
tell
them
to
those
of
the
men
who
understood
the
spanish
language
in
which
ramona
spoke
translated
it
to
those
who
did
not
and
there
was
a
cordial
outburst
of
thanks
to
the
senorita
from
all
lips
all
were
only
too
ready
to
wait
for
the
supper
their
haste
to
begin
on
the
ortega
had
suddenly
faded
from
their
minds
only
alessandro
hesitated
it
is
a
good
six
hours
ride
to
ortega
he
said
to
the
men
be
late
in
if
you
do
not
start
supper
will
be
ready
in
an
hour
said
ramona
please
let
them
stay
one
hour
ca
make
any
alessandro
smiled
it
will
take
nearer
two
senorita
before
they
are
off
he
said
but
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
and
many
thanks
to
you
senorita
for
thinking
of
oh
i
did
not
think
of
it
myself
said
ramona
it
was
margarita
here
who
came
and
told
me
she
knew
we
would
be
ashamed
to
have
the
shearers
go
away
hungry
i
am
afraid
they
are
very
hungry
indeed
she
added
ruefully
it
must
be
dreadful
to
go
a
whole
day
without
anything
to
eat
they
had
their
breakfast
soon
after
sunrise
did
they
not
yes
senorita
answered
alessandro
but
that
is
not
long
one
can
do
without
food
very
well
for
one
day
i
often
exclaimed
ramona
but
why
should
you
do
that
then
suddenly
bethinking
herself
she
said
in
her
heart
oh
what
a
thoughtless
question
can
it
be
they
are
so
poor
as
that
and
to
save
alessandro
from
replying
she
set
off
on
a
run
for
the
house
saying
come
come
margarita
we
must
go
and
help
at
the
will
the
senorita
let
me
help
too
asked
alessandro
wondering
at
his
own
boldness
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
oh
no
she
cried
there
is
not
yes
there
is
too
you
can
help
carry
the
things
down
to
the
booth
for
we
are
short
of
hands
now
with
juan
can
in
bed
and
luigo
gone
to
ventura
for
the
doctor
you
and
some
of
your
men
might
carry
all
the
supper
over
i
call
you
when
we
are
the
men
sat
down
in
a
group
and
waited
contentedly
smoking
chatting
and
laughing
alessandro
walked
up
and
down
between
the
kitchen
and
the
shed
he
could
hear
the
sounds
of
rattling
dishes
jingling
spoons
frying
pouring
water
savory
smells
began
to
be
wafted
out
evidently
old
marda
meant
to
atone
for
the
shortcoming
of
the
noon
juan
can
in
his
bed
also
heard
and
smelled
what
was
going
on
may
the
fiends
get
me
he
growled
if
that
wasteful
old
hussy
is
getting
up
a
feast
for
those
beasts
of
indians
there
mutton
and
onions
and
peppers
stewing
and
potatoes
i
be
bound
and
god
knows
what
else
for
beggars
that
are
only
too
thankful
to
get
a
handful
of
roasted
wheat
or
a
bowl
of
acorn
porridge
at
home
well
they
have
to
say
they
were
well
feasted
at
the
moreno
that
one
comfort
i
wonder
if
margarita
think
i
am
worthy
of
tasting
that
stew
san
jose
but
it
smells
well
margarita
margarita
he
called
at
top
of
his
lungs
but
margarita
did
not
hear
she
was
absorbed
in
her
duties
in
the
kitchen
and
having
already
taken
juan
at
sundown
a
bowl
of
the
good
broth
which
the
doctor
had
said
was
the
only
sort
of
food
he
must
eat
for
two
weeks
she
had
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
for
the
night
moreover
margarita
was
she
was
more
than
half
in
love
with
the
handsome
alessandro
who
when
he
had
been
on
the
ranch
the
year
before
had
danced
with
her
and
said
many
a
light
pleasant
word
to
her
evenings
as
a
young
man
may
and
what
ailed
him
now
that
he
seemed
when
he
saw
her
as
if
she
were
no
more
than
a
transparent
shade
through
which
he
stared
at
the
sky
behind
her
she
did
not
know
senor
felipe
illness
she
thought
and
the
general
misery
and
confusion
had
perhaps
put
everything
else
out
of
his
head
but
now
he
was
going
to
stay
and
it
would
be
good
fun
having
him
there
if
only
senor
felipe
got
well
which
he
seemed
likely
to
do
and
as
margarita
flew
about
here
there
and
everywhere
she
cast
frequent
glances
at
the
tall
straight
figure
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
dusk
outside
alessandro
did
not
see
her
he
did
not
see
anything
he
was
looking
off
at
the
sunset
and
listening
ramona
had
said
i
will
call
you
when
we
are
but
she
did
not
do
as
she
said
she
told
margarita
to
call
run
margarita
she
said
all
is
ready
now
see
if
alessandro
is
in
sight
call
him
to
come
and
take
the
so
it
was
margarita
voice
and
not
ramona
that
called
alessandro
alessandro
the
supper
is
but
it
was
ramona
who
when
alessandro
reached
the
doorway
stood
there
holding
in
her
arms
a
huge
smoking
platter
of
the
stew
which
had
so
roused
poor
juan
can
longings
and
it
was
ramona
who
said
as
she
gave
it
into
alessandro
hands
take
care
alessandro
it
is
very
full
the
gravy
will
run
over
if
you
are
not
careful
you
are
not
used
to
waiting
on
table
and
as
she
said
it
she
smiled
full
into
eyes
a
little
flitting
gentle
friendly
smile
which
went
near
to
making
him
drop
the
platter
mutton
gravy
and
all
then
and
there
at
her
feet
the
men
ate
fast
and
greedily
and
it
was
not
after
all
much
more
than
an
hour
when
full
fed
and
happy
they
were
mounting
their
horses
to
set
off
at
the
last
moment
alessandro
drew
one
of
them
aside
jose
he
said
whose
horse
is
the
faster
yours
or
antonio
mine
promptly
replied
jose
mine
by
a
great
deal
i
will
run
antonio
any
day
he
alessandro
knew
this
as
well
before
asking
as
after
but
alessandro
was
learning
a
great
many
things
in
these
days
among
other
things
a
little
diplomacy
he
wanted
a
man
to
ride
at
the
swiftest
to
temecula
and
back
he
knew
that
jose
pony
could
go
like
the
wind
he
also
knew
that
there
was
a
perpetual
feud
of
rivalry
between
him
and
antonio
in
matter
of
the
fleetness
of
their
respective
ponies
so
having
chosen
jose
for
his
messenger
he
went
thus
to
work
to
make
sure
that
he
would
urge
his
horse
to
its
utmost
speed
whispering
in
jose
ear
a
few
words
he
said
will
you
go
i
will
pay
you
for
the
time
all
you
could
earn
at
the
i
will
go
said
jose
elated
you
will
see
me
back
tomorrow
by
not
earlier
asked
alessandro
i
thought
by
well
by
noon
be
it
then
said
jose
the
horse
can
do
have
great
care
said
alessandro
that
will
i
replied
jose
and
giving
his
horse
sides
a
sharp
punch
with
his
knees
set
off
at
full
gallop
westward
i
have
sent
jose
with
a
message
to
temecula
said
alessandro
walking
up
to
fernando
he
will
be
back
here
tomorrow
noon
and
join
you
at
the
ortega
the
next
back
here
by
noon
exclaimed
fernando
not
unless
he
kills
his
horse
that
was
what
he
said
replied
alessandro
nonchalantly
easy
enough
too
cried
antonio
riding
up
on
his
little
dun
mare
i
go
in
less
time
than
that
on
this
mare
jose
is
no
match
for
her
and
never
was
why
did
you
not
send
me
alessandro
is
your
horse
really
faster
than
jose
said
alessandro
then
i
wish
i
had
sent
you
i
send
you
next
vii
it
was
strange
to
see
how
quickly
and
naturally
alessandro
fitted
into
his
place
in
the
household
how
tangles
straightened
out
and
rough
places
became
smooth
as
he
quietly
took
matters
in
hand
luckily
old
juan
can
had
always
liked
him
and
felt
a
great
sense
of
relief
at
the
news
of
his
staying
on
not
a
wholly
unselfish
relief
perhaps
for
since
his
accident
juan
had
not
been
without
fears
that
he
might
lose
his
place
altogether
there
was
a
mexican
he
knew
who
had
long
been
scheming
to
get
the
situation
and
had
once
openly
boasted
at
a
fandango
where
he
was
dancing
with
anita
that
as
soon
as
that
superannuated
old
fool
juan
canito
was
out
of
the
way
he
meant
to
be
the
senora
moreno
head
shepherd
himself
to
have
seen
this
man
in
authority
on
the
place
would
have
driven
juan
out
of
his
mind
but
the
gentle
alessandro
only
an
indian
and
of
course
the
senora
would
never
think
of
putting
an
indian
permanently
in
so
responsible
a
position
on
the
estate
it
was
exactly
as
juan
would
have
wished
and
he
fraternized
with
alessandro
heartily
from
the
outset
kept
him
in
his
room
by
the
hour
giving
him
hundreds
of
directions
and
explanations
about
things
which
if
only
he
had
known
it
alessandro
understood
far
better
than
he
did
alessandro
father
had
managed
the
mission
flocks
and
herds
at
san
luis
rey
for
twenty
years
few
were
as
skilful
as
he
he
himself
owned
nearly
as
many
sheep
as
the
senora
moreno
but
this
juan
did
not
know
neither
did
he
realize
that
alessandro
as
chief
pablo
son
had
a
position
of
his
own
not
without
dignity
and
authority
to
juan
an
indian
was
an
indian
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
gentle
courteousness
of
alessandro
manner
his
quiet
behavior
were
all
set
down
in
mind
to
the
score
of
the
boy
native
amiability
and
sweetness
if
juan
had
been
told
that
the
senor
felipe
himself
had
not
been
more
carefully
trained
in
all
precepts
of
kindliness
honorable
dealing
and
polite
usage
by
the
senora
his
mother
than
had
alessandro
by
his
father
he
would
have
opened
his
eyes
wide
the
standards
of
the
two
parents
were
different
to
be
sure
but
the
advantage
could
not
be
shown
to
be
entirely
on
the
senora
side
there
were
many
things
that
felipe
knew
of
which
alessandro
was
profoundly
ignorant
but
there
were
others
in
which
alessandro
could
have
taught
felipe
and
when
it
came
to
the
things
of
the
soul
and
of
honor
alessandro
plane
was
the
higher
of
the
two
felipe
was
a
honorable
man
as
men
go
but
circumstances
and
opportunity
would
have
a
hold
on
him
they
could
never
get
on
alessandro
alessandro
would
not
lie
felipe
might
alessandro
was
by
nature
full
of
veneration
and
the
religious
instinct
felipe
had
been
trained
into
being
a
good
catholic
but
they
were
both
singularly
young
men
and
destined
by
the
strange
chance
which
had
thus
brought
them
into
familiar
relations
to
become
strongly
attached
to
each
other
after
the
day
on
which
the
madness
of
felipe
fever
had
been
so
miraculously
soothed
and
controlled
by
alessandro
singing
he
was
never
again
wildly
delirious
when
he
waked
in
the
night
from
that
first
long
sleep
he
was
as
father
salvierderra
had
predicted
in
his
right
mind
knew
every
one
and
asked
rational
questions
but
the
and
excited
brain
did
not
for
some
time
wholly
resume
normal
action
at
intervals
he
wandered
especially
when
just
arousing
from
sleep
and
strangely
enough
it
was
always
for
alessandro
that
he
called
at
these
times
and
it
seemed
always
to
be
music
that
he
craved
he
recollected
alessandro
having
sung
to
him
that
first
night
i
was
not
so
crazy
as
you
all
thought
he
said
i
knew
a
great
many
of
the
things
i
said
but
i
could
help
saying
them
and
i
heard
ramona
ask
alessandro
to
sing
and
when
he
began
i
remember
i
thought
the
virgin
had
reached
down
and
put
her
hand
on
my
head
and
cooled
on
the
second
evening
the
first
after
the
shearers
had
left
alessandro
seeing
ramona
in
the
veranda
went
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
said
senorita
would
senor
felipe
like
to
have
me
play
on
the
violin
to
him
tonight
why
whose
violin
have
you
got
exclaimed
ramona
astonished
my
own
your
own
i
thought
you
said
you
did
not
bring
yes
senorita
that
is
true
but
i
sent
for
it
last
night
and
it
is
sent
to
temecula
and
back
already
cried
ramona
yes
senorita
our
ponies
are
swift
and
strong
they
can
go
a
hundred
miles
in
a
day
and
not
suffer
it
was
jose
brought
it
and
he
is
at
the
ortega
by
this
ramona
eyes
glistened
i
wish
i
could
have
thanked
him
she
said
you
should
have
let
me
know
he
ought
to
have
been
paid
for
i
paid
him
senorita
he
went
for
me
said
alessandro
with
a
shade
of
wounded
pride
in
the
tone
which
ramona
should
have
perceived
but
did
not
and
went
on
hurting
the
lover
heart
still
more
but
it
was
for
us
that
you
sent
for
it
alessandro
the
senora
would
rather
pay
the
messenger
it
is
paid
senorita
it
is
nothing
if
the
senor
felipe
wishes
to
hear
the
violin
i
will
play
and
alessandro
walked
slowly
away
ramona
gazed
after
him
for
the
first
time
she
looked
at
him
with
no
thought
of
his
being
an
indian
a
thought
there
had
surely
been
no
need
of
her
having
since
his
skin
was
not
a
shade
darker
than
felipe
but
so
strong
was
the
race
feeling
that
never
till
that
moment
had
she
forgotten
it
what
a
superb
head
and
what
a
walk
she
thought
then
looking
more
observantly
she
said
he
walks
as
if
he
were
offended
he
did
not
like
my
offering
to
pay
for
the
messenger
he
wanted
to
do
it
for
dear
felipe
i
will
tell
felipe
and
we
will
give
him
some
present
when
he
goes
is
he
splendid
senorita
came
in
a
light
laughing
tone
from
margarita
lips
close
to
her
ear
in
the
fond
freedom
of
their
relation
is
he
splendid
and
oh
senorita
you
ca
think
how
he
dances
last
year
i
danced
with
him
every
night
he
has
wings
on
his
feet
for
all
he
is
so
tall
and
there
was
a
coquettish
consciousness
in
the
girl
tone
that
was
suddenly
for
some
unexplained
reason
exceedingly
displeasing
to
ramona
drawing
herself
away
she
spoke
to
margarita
in
a
tone
she
had
never
before
in
her
life
used
it
is
not
fitting
to
speak
like
that
about
young
men
the
senora
would
be
displeased
if
she
heard
you
she
said
and
walked
swiftly
away
leaving
poor
margarita
as
astounded
as
if
she
had
got
a
box
on
the
ear
she
looked
after
ramona
retreating
figure
then
after
alessandro
she
had
heard
them
talking
together
just
before
she
came
up
thoroughly
bewildered
and
puzzled
she
stood
motionless
for
several
seconds
reflecting
then
shaking
her
head
she
ran
away
trying
to
dismiss
the
harsh
speech
from
her
mind
alessandro
must
have
vexed
the
senorita
she
thought
to
make
her
speak
like
that
to
but
the
incident
was
not
so
easily
dismissed
from
margarita
thoughts
many
times
in
the
day
it
recurred
to
her
still
a
bewilderment
and
a
puzzle
as
far
from
solution
as
ever
it
was
a
tiny
seed
whose
name
she
did
not
dream
of
but
it
was
dropped
in
soil
where
it
would
grow
some
day
soil
and
a
bitter
seed
and
when
it
blossomed
ramona
would
have
an
enemy
all
unconscious
equally
of
margarita
heart
and
her
own
ramona
proceeded
to
felipe
room
felipe
was
sleeping
the
senora
sitting
by
his
side
as
she
had
sat
for
days
and
nights
her
dark
face
looking
thinner
and
more
drawn
each
day
her
hair
looking
even
whiter
if
that
could
be
and
her
voice
growing
hollow
from
faintness
and
sorrow
dear
senora
whispered
ramona
do
go
out
for
a
few
moments
while
he
sleeps
and
let
me
watch
just
on
the
walk
in
front
of
the
veranda
the
sun
is
still
lying
there
bright
and
warm
you
will
be
ill
if
you
do
not
have
the
senora
shook
her
head
my
place
is
here
she
answered
speaking
in
a
dry
hard
tone
sympathy
was
hateful
to
the
senora
moreno
she
wished
neither
to
give
it
nor
take
it
i
shall
not
leave
him
i
do
not
need
the
ramona
had
a
rose
in
her
hand
the
veranda
eaves
were
now
shaded
with
them
hanging
down
like
a
thick
fringe
of
golden
tassels
it
was
the
rose
felipe
loved
best
stooping
she
laid
it
on
the
bed
near
felipe
head
he
will
like
to
see
it
when
he
wakes
she
said
the
senora
seized
it
and
flung
it
far
out
in
the
room
take
it
away
flowers
are
poison
when
one
is
ill
she
said
coldly
have
i
never
told
you
that
no
senora
replied
ramona
meekly
and
she
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
saucer
of
musk
which
the
senora
kept
on
the
table
close
to
pillow
the
musk
is
different
said
the
senora
seeing
the
glance
musk
is
a
medicine
it
ramona
knew
but
she
would
have
never
dared
to
say
that
felipe
hated
musk
many
times
he
had
said
to
her
how
he
hated
the
odor
but
his
mother
was
so
fond
of
it
that
it
must
always
be
that
the
veranda
and
the
house
would
be
full
of
it
ramona
hated
it
too
at
times
it
made
her
faint
with
a
deadly
faintness
but
neither
she
nor
felipe
would
have
confessed
as
much
to
the
senora
and
if
they
had
she
would
have
thought
it
all
a
fancy
shall
i
stay
asked
ramona
gently
as
you
please
replied
the
senora
the
simple
presence
of
ramona
irked
her
now
with
a
feeling
she
did
not
pretend
to
analyze
and
would
have
been
terrified
at
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
dared
to
say
to
herself
in
plain
words
why
is
that
girl
well
and
strong
and
my
felipe
lying
here
like
to
die
if
felipe
dies
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
what
is
she
to
be
preserved
of
the
saints
but
that
or
something
like
it
was
what
she
felt
whenever
ramona
entered
the
room
still
more
whenever
she
assisted
in
ministering
to
felipe
if
it
had
been
possible
the
senora
would
have
had
no
hands
but
her
own
do
aught
for
her
boy
even
tears
from
ramona
sometimes
irritated
her
what
does
she
know
about
loving
felipe
he
is
nothing
to
her
thought
the
senora
strangely
mistaken
strangely
blind
strangely
forgetting
how
feeble
is
the
tie
of
blood
in
the
veins
by
the
side
of
love
in
the
heart
if
into
this
fiery
soul
of
the
senora
could
have
been
dropped
one
second
knowledge
of
the
relative
positions
she
and
ramona
already
occupied
in
felipe
heart
she
would
on
the
spot
have
either
died
herself
or
have
slain
ramona
one
or
the
other
but
no
such
knowledge
was
possible
no
such
idea
could
have
found
entrance
into
the
mind
a
revelation
from
heaven
of
it
could
hardly
have
reached
even
her
ears
so
impenetrable
are
the
veils
which
fortunately
for
us
all
are
forever
held
by
viewless
hands
between
us
and
the
nearest
and
closest
of
our
daily
companions
at
twilight
of
this
day
felipe
was
restless
and
feverish
again
he
had
dozed
at
intervals
all
day
long
but
had
had
no
refreshing
sleep
send
for
alessandro
he
said
let
him
come
and
sing
to
he
has
his
violin
now
he
can
play
if
you
would
like
that
better
said
ramona
and
she
related
what
alessandro
had
told
her
of
the
messenger
having
ridden
to
temecula
and
back
in
a
night
and
half
a
day
to
bring
it
i
wanted
to
pay
the
man
she
said
i
knew
of
course
your
mother
would
wish
to
reward
him
but
i
fancy
alessandro
was
offended
he
answered
me
shortly
that
it
was
paid
and
it
was
you
could
have
offended
him
more
said
felipe
what
a
pity
he
is
as
proud
as
lucifer
himself
that
alessandro
you
know
his
father
has
always
been
the
head
of
their
band
in
fact
he
has
authority
over
several
bands
general
they
call
it
now
since
they
got
the
title
from
the
americans
they
used
to
call
it
and
until
father
peyri
left
san
luis
rey
pablo
was
in
charge
of
all
the
sheep
and
general
steward
and
paymaster
father
peyri
trusted
him
with
everything
i
heard
he
would
leave
boxes
full
of
uncounted
gold
in
pablo
charge
to
pay
off
the
indians
pablo
reads
and
writes
and
is
very
well
off
he
has
as
many
sheep
as
we
have
i
fancy
what
exclaimed
ramona
astonished
they
all
look
as
if
they
were
oh
well
so
they
are
replied
felipe
compared
with
us
but
one
reason
is
they
share
everything
with
each
other
old
pablo
feeds
and
supports
half
his
village
they
say
so
long
as
he
has
anything
he
will
never
see
one
of
his
indians
how
generous
warmly
exclaimed
ramona
i
think
they
are
better
than
we
are
felipe
i
think
so
too
said
felipe
that
what
i
have
always
said
the
indians
are
the
most
generous
people
in
the
world
of
course
they
have
learned
it
partly
from
us
but
they
were
very
much
so
when
the
fathers
first
came
here
you
ask
father
salvierderra
some
day
he
has
read
all
father
junipero
and
father
crespi
diaries
and
he
says
it
is
wonderful
how
the
wild
savages
gave
food
to
every
one
who
felipe
you
are
talking
too
much
said
the
senora
voice
in
the
doorway
and
as
she
spoke
she
looked
reproachfully
at
ramona
if
she
had
said
in
words
see
how
unfit
you
are
to
be
trusted
with
felipe
no
wonder
i
do
not
leave
the
room
except
when
i
must
her
meaning
could
not
have
been
plainer
ramona
felt
it
keenly
and
not
without
some
misgiving
that
it
was
deserved
oh
dear
felipe
has
it
hurt
you
she
said
timidly
and
to
the
senora
indeed
senora
he
has
been
speaking
but
a
very
few
moments
very
go
call
alessandro
ramona
will
you
said
felipe
tell
him
to
bring
his
violin
i
think
i
will
go
to
sleep
if
he
a
long
search
ramona
had
for
alessandro
everybody
had
seen
him
a
few
minutes
ago
but
nobody
knew
where
he
was
now
kitchens
sheepfolds
vineyards
orchards
juan
can
bedchamber
ramona
searched
them
all
in
vain
at
last
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
veranda
steps
and
looking
down
the
garden
she
thought
she
saw
figures
moving
under
the
willows
by
the
can
he
be
there
she
said
what
can
he
be
doing
there
who
is
it
with
him
and
she
walked
down
the
path
calling
alessandro
alessandro
at
the
first
sound
alessandro
sprang
from
the
side
of
his
companion
and
almost
before
the
second
syllables
had
been
said
was
standing
face
to
face
with
ramona
here
i
am
senorita
does
senor
felipe
want
me
i
have
my
violin
here
i
thought
perhaps
he
would
like
to
have
me
play
to
him
in
the
yes
replied
ramona
he
wishes
to
hear
you
i
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
as
she
spoke
she
was
half
unconsciously
peering
beyond
into
the
dusk
to
see
whose
figure
it
was
slowly
moving
by
the
brook
nothing
escaped
alessandro
notice
where
ramona
was
concerned
it
is
margarita
he
said
instantly
does
the
senorita
want
her
shall
i
run
and
call
her
no
said
ramona
again
displeased
she
knew
not
why
nor
in
fact
knew
she
was
displeased
no
i
was
not
looking
for
her
what
is
she
doing
there
she
is
washing
replied
alessandro
innocently
washing
at
this
time
of
day
thought
ramona
severely
a
mere
pretext
i
shall
watch
margarita
the
senora
would
never
allow
this
sort
of
and
as
she
walked
back
to
the
house
by
alessandro
side
she
meditated
whether
or
no
she
would
herself
speak
to
margarita
on
the
subject
in
the
morning
margarita
in
the
mean
time
was
also
having
her
season
of
reflections
not
the
pleasantest
as
she
soused
her
aprons
up
and
down
in
the
water
she
said
to
herself
i
may
as
well
finish
them
now
i
am
here
how
provoking
i
no
more
than
got
a
word
with
him
than
she
must
come
calling
him
away
and
he
flies
as
if
he
was
shot
on
an
arrow
at
the
first
word
i
like
to
know
what
come
over
the
man
to
be
so
different
if
i
could
ever
get
a
good
with
him
alone
i
soon
find
out
oh
but
his
eyes
go
through
me
through
and
through
me
i
know
he
an
indian
but
what
do
i
care
for
that
he
a
million
times
handsomer
than
senor
felipe
and
juan
jose
said
the
other
day
he
make
enough
better
head
shepherd
than
old
juan
can
if
senor
felipe
only
see
it
and
why
should
he
get
to
see
it
if
alessandro
here
all
summer
and
before
the
aprons
were
done
margarita
had
a
fine
up
herself
and
alessandro
married
a
nice
little
house
children
playing
in
the
sunshine
below
the
she
herself
still
working
for
the
senora
and
the
senorita
will
perhaps
marry
senor
felipe
she
added
her
thoughts
moving
more
hesitatingly
he
worships
the
ground
she
walks
on
anybody
with
quarter
of
a
blind
eye
can
see
that
but
maybe
the
senora
would
not
let
him
anyhow
senor
felipe
is
sure
to
have
a
wife
and
so
and
it
was
an
innocent
girlish
castle
built
of
sweet
and
natural
longings
for
which
no
maiden
high
or
low
need
blush
but
its
foundations
were
laid
in
sand
on
which
would
presently
beat
such
winds
and
floods
as
poor
little
margarita
never
dreamed
of
the
next
day
margarita
and
ramona
both
went
about
their
day
business
with
a
secret
purpose
in
their
hearts
margarita
had
made
up
her
mind
that
before
night
she
would
by
fair
means
or
foul
have
a
good
long
talk
with
alessandro
he
was
fond
enough
of
me
last
year
i
know
she
said
to
herself
recalling
some
of
the
dances
and
the
at
that
time
it
because
he
is
so
put
upon
by
everybody
now
what
with
juan
can
in
one
bed
sending
for
him
to
prate
to
him
about
the
sheep
and
senor
felipe
in
another
sending
for
him
to
fiddle
him
to
sleep
and
all
the
care
of
the
sheep
it
a
wonder
he
not
out
of
his
mind
altogether
but
i
find
a
chance
or
make
one
before
this
sun
sets
if
i
can
once
get
a
with
him
i
not
afraid
after
that
i
know
the
way
it
is
with
men
said
the
confident
margarita
who
truth
being
told
it
must
be
admitted
did
indeed
know
a
great
deal
about
the
way
it
is
with
men
and
could
be
safely
backed
in
a
fair
field
with
a
fair
start
against
any
girl
of
her
age
and
station
in
the
country
so
much
for
margarita
purpose
at
the
outset
of
a
day
destined
to
be
an
eventful
one
in
her
life
ramona
purpose
was
no
less
clear
she
had
decided
after
some
reflection
that
she
would
not
speak
to
the
senora
about
having
been
under
the
willows
with
alessandro
in
the
previous
evening
but
would
watch
her
carefully
and
see
whether
there
were
any
farther
signs
of
her
attempting
to
have
clandestine
interviews
with
him
this
course
she
adopted
she
thought
chiefly
because
of
her
affection
for
margarita
and
her
unwillingness
to
expose
her
to
the
displeasure
which
would
be
great
and
terrible
to
bear
she
was
also
aware
of
an
unwillingness
to
bring
anything
to
light
which
would
reflect
ever
so
lightly
upon
alessandro
in
the
senora
estimation
and
he
is
not
really
to
blame
thought
ramona
if
a
girl
follows
him
about
and
makes
free
with
him
she
must
have
seen
him
at
the
willows
and
gone
down
there
on
purpose
to
meet
him
making
a
pretext
of
the
washing
for
she
never
in
this
world
would
have
gone
to
wash
in
the
dark
as
he
must
have
known
if
he
were
not
a
fool
he
is
not
the
sort
of
person
it
seems
to
me
to
be
fooling
with
maids
he
seems
as
full
of
grave
thought
as
father
salvierderra
if
i
see
anything
amiss
in
margarita
i
shall
speak
to
her
myself
kindly
but
firmly
and
tell
her
to
conduct
herself
more
then
as
the
other
maiden
had
done
ramona
thoughts
being
concentrated
on
alessandro
altered
a
little
from
their
first
key
and
grew
softer
and
more
imaginative
strangely
enough
taking
some
of
the
phrases
as
it
were
out
of
the
other
maiden
mouth
i
never
saw
such
eyes
as
alessandro
has
she
said
i
wonder
any
girl
should
make
free
with
him
even
i
myself
when
he
fixes
his
eyes
on
me
feel
a
constraint
there
is
something
in
them
like
the
eyes
of
a
saint
so
solemn
yet
so
mild
i
am
sure
he
is
very
and
so
the
day
opened
and
if
there
were
abroad
in
the
valley
that
day
a
demon
of
mischief
let
loose
to
tangle
the
skeins
of
human
affairs
things
could
not
have
fallen
out
better
for
his
purpose
than
they
did
for
it
was
not
yet
ten
of
the
morning
when
ramona
sitting
at
her
embroidery
in
the
veranda
half
hid
behind
the
vines
saw
alessandro
going
with
his
in
his
hand
towards
the
at
the
east
of
the
garden
and
joining
the
almond
orchard
i
wonder
what
he
is
going
to
do
there
she
thought
he
ca
be
going
to
cut
willows
and
her
eyes
followed
him
till
he
disappeared
among
the
trees
ramona
was
not
the
only
one
who
saw
this
margarita
looking
from
the
east
window
of
father
salvierderra
room
saw
the
same
thing
my
chance
she
said
and
throwing
a
white
reboso
coquettishly
over
her
head
she
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
house
she
ran
swiftly
in
the
direction
in
which
alessandro
had
gone
the
sound
of
her
steps
reached
ramona
who
lifting
her
eyes
took
in
the
whole
situation
at
a
glance
there
was
no
possible
duty
no
possible
message
which
would
take
margarita
there
ramona
cheeks
blazed
with
a
disproportionate
indignation
but
she
bethought
herself
ah
the
senora
may
have
sent
her
to
call
alessandro
she
rose
went
to
the
door
of
felipe
room
and
looked
in
the
senora
was
sitting
in
the
chair
by
felipe
bed
with
her
eyes
closed
felipe
was
dozing
the
senora
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
inquiringly
at
ramona
do
you
know
where
margarita
is
said
ramona
in
father
salvierderra
room
or
else
in
the
kitchen
helping
marda
replied
the
senora
in
a
whisper
i
told
her
to
help
marda
with
the
peppers
this
ramona
nodded
returned
to
the
veranda
and
sat
down
to
decide
on
her
course
of
action
then
she
rose
again
and
going
to
father
salvierderra
room
looked
in
the
room
was
still
in
disorder
margarita
had
left
her
work
there
unfinished
the
color
deepened
on
ramona
cheeks
it
was
strange
how
accurately
she
divined
each
process
of
the
incident
she
saw
him
from
this
window
said
ramona
and
has
run
after
him
it
is
shameful
i
will
go
and
call
her
back
and
let
her
see
that
i
saw
it
all
it
is
high
time
that
this
was
but
once
back
in
the
veranda
ramona
halted
and
seated
herself
in
her
chair
again
the
idea
of
seeming
to
spy
was
revolting
to
her
i
will
wait
here
till
she
comes
back
she
said
and
took
up
her
embroidery
but
she
could
not
work
as
the
minutes
went
slowly
by
she
sat
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
almond
orchard
where
first
alessandro
and
then
margarita
had
disappeared
at
last
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
it
seemed
to
her
already
a
very
long
time
it
was
not
in
reality
very
long
a
half
hour
or
so
perhaps
but
it
was
long
enough
for
margarita
to
have
made
great
headway
as
she
thought
in
her
talk
with
alessandro
and
for
things
to
have
reached
just
the
worst
possible
crisis
at
which
they
could
have
been
surprised
when
ramona
suddenly
appeared
at
the
orchard
gate
saying
in
a
stern
tone
margarita
you
are
wanted
in
the
house
at
a
bad
crisis
indeed
for
everybody
concerned
the
picture
which
ramona
had
seen
as
she
reached
the
gate
was
this
alessandro
standing
with
his
back
against
the
fence
his
right
hand
hanging
listlessly
down
with
the
in
it
his
left
hand
in
the
hand
of
margarita
who
stood
close
to
him
looking
up
in
his
face
with
a
expression
what
made
bad
matters
worse
was
that
at
the
first
sight
of
ramona
alessandro
snatched
his
hand
from
margarita
and
tried
to
draw
farther
off
from
her
looking
at
her
with
an
expression
which
even
in
her
anger
ramona
could
not
help
seeing
was
one
of
disgust
and
repulsion
and
if
ramona
saw
it
how
much
more
did
margarita
saw
it
as
only
a
woman
repulsed
in
presence
of
another
woman
can
see
and
feel
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
telling
it
takes
double
treble
the
time
of
the
happening
before
alessandro
was
fairly
aware
what
had
befallen
ramona
and
margarita
were
disappearing
from
view
under
the
garden
trellis
ramona
walking
in
advance
stately
silent
and
margarita
following
sulky
abject
in
her
gait
but
with
a
raging
whirlwind
in
her
heart
it
had
taken
only
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
but
it
had
told
margarita
the
truth
alessandro
too
my
he
said
the
senorita
thought
me
making
love
to
that
girl
may
the
fiends
get
her
the
senorita
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
dog
how
could
she
think
a
man
would
look
at
a
woman
after
he
had
once
seen
her
and
i
can
never
never
speak
to
her
to
tell
her
oh
this
can
not
be
borne
and
in
his
rage
alessandro
threw
his
whirling
through
the
air
so
fiercely
it
sank
to
the
hilt
in
one
of
the
old
he
wished
he
were
dead
he
was
minded
to
flee
the
place
how
could
he
ever
look
the
senorita
in
the
face
again
perdition
take
that
girl
he
said
over
and
over
in
his
helpless
despair
an
ill
outlook
for
margarita
after
this
and
the
girl
had
not
deserved
it
in
margarita
heart
the
pain
was
more
clearly
defined
she
had
seen
ramona
a
before
alessandro
had
and
dreaming
no
special
harm
except
a
little
confusion
at
being
seen
thus
standing
with
him
for
she
would
tell
the
senorita
all
about
it
when
matters
had
gone
a
little
farther
had
not
let
go
of
alessandro
hand
but
the
next
second
she
had
seen
in
his
face
a
look
oh
she
would
never
forget
it
never
that
she
should
live
to
have
had
any
man
look
at
her
like
that
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
senorita
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
rushing
into
his
face
and
he
had
snatched
his
hand
away
for
it
was
margarita
herself
that
had
taken
his
hand
not
he
hers
had
snatched
his
hand
away
and
pushed
her
from
him
till
she
had
nearly
fallen
all
this
might
have
been
borne
if
it
had
been
only
a
fear
of
the
seeing
them
which
had
made
him
do
it
but
margarita
knew
a
great
deal
better
than
that
that
one
swift
anguished
appealing
worshipping
look
on
alessandro
face
as
his
eyes
rested
on
ramona
was
like
a
flash
of
light
into
margarita
consciousness
far
better
than
alessandro
himself
she
now
knew
his
secret
in
her
first
rage
she
did
not
realize
either
the
gulf
between
herself
and
ramona
or
that
between
ramona
and
alessandro
her
jealous
rage
was
as
entire
as
if
they
had
all
been
equals
together
she
lost
her
head
altogether
and
there
was
embodied
insolence
in
the
tone
in
which
she
said
presently
did
the
senorita
want
me
turning
swiftly
on
her
and
looking
her
full
in
the
eye
ramona
said
i
saw
you
go
to
the
orchard
margarita
and
i
knew
what
you
went
for
i
knew
that
you
were
at
the
brook
last
night
with
alessandro
all
i
wanted
of
you
was
to
tell
you
that
if
i
see
anything
more
of
this
sort
i
shall
speak
to
the
there
is
no
harm
muttered
margarita
sullenly
i
do
know
what
the
senorita
you
know
very
well
margarita
retorted
ramona
you
know
that
the
senora
permits
nothing
of
the
kind
be
careful
now
what
you
and
with
that
the
two
separated
ramona
returning
to
the
veranda
and
her
embroidery
and
margarita
to
her
neglected
duty
of
making
the
good
father
bed
but
each
girl
heart
was
hot
and
unhappy
and
would
have
been
still
hotter
and
unhappier
had
she
heard
the
words
which
were
being
spoken
on
the
veranda
a
little
later
after
a
few
minutes
of
his
blind
rage
at
margarita
himself
and
fate
generally
alessandro
recovering
his
senses
had
ingeniously
persuaded
himself
that
as
the
senora
and
also
the
senorita
servant
for
the
time
being
he
owed
it
to
them
to
explain
the
situation
in
which
he
had
just
been
found
just
what
he
was
to
say
he
did
not
know
but
no
sooner
had
the
thought
struck
him
than
he
set
off
at
full
speed
for
the
house
hoping
to
find
ramona
on
the
veranda
where
he
knew
she
spent
all
her
time
when
not
with
senor
felipe
when
ramona
saw
him
coming
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
was
absorbed
in
her
embroidery
she
did
not
wish
to
look
at
him
the
footsteps
stopped
she
knew
he
was
standing
at
the
steps
she
would
not
look
up
she
thought
if
she
did
not
he
would
go
away
she
did
not
know
either
the
indian
or
the
lover
nature
after
a
time
finding
the
consciousness
of
the
soundless
presence
intolerable
she
looked
up
and
surprised
on
alessandro
face
a
gaze
which
had
in
its
long
interval
of
freedom
from
observation
been
slowly
gathering
up
into
it
all
the
passion
of
the
man
soul
as
a
draws
the
fire
of
the
sun
rays
involuntarily
a
low
cry
burst
from
ramona
lips
and
she
sprang
to
her
feet
ah
did
i
frighten
the
senorita
forgive
i
have
been
waiting
here
a
long
time
to
speak
to
her
i
wished
to
say
suddenly
alessandro
discovered
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
wished
to
say
as
suddenly
ramona
discovered
that
she
knew
all
he
wished
to
say
but
she
spoke
not
only
looked
at
him
searchingly
senorita
he
began
again
i
would
never
be
unfaithful
to
my
duty
to
the
senora
and
to
i
believe
you
alessandro
said
ramona
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
at
these
words
a
radiant
joy
spread
over
alessandro
face
he
had
not
hoped
for
this
he
felt
rather
than
heard
that
ramona
understood
him
he
felt
for
the
first
time
a
personal
relation
between
himself
and
her
it
is
well
he
said
in
the
brief
phrase
so
frequent
with
his
people
it
is
and
with
a
reverent
inclination
of
his
head
he
walked
away
margarita
still
dawdling
surlily
over
her
work
in
father
salvierderra
room
heard
alessandro
voice
and
running
to
discover
to
whom
he
was
speaking
caught
these
last
words
peering
from
behind
a
curtain
she
saw
the
look
with
which
he
said
them
saw
also
the
expression
on
ramona
face
as
she
listened
margarita
clenched
her
hands
the
seed
had
blossomed
ramona
had
an
enemy
oh
but
i
am
glad
father
salvierderra
has
gone
said
the
girl
bitterly
he
have
had
this
out
of
me
spite
of
everything
i
got
to
confess
for
a
year
maybe
and
much
can
happen
in
that
much
indeed
viii
felipe
gained
but
slowly
the
relapse
was
indeed
as
father
salvierderra
had
said
worse
than
the
original
attack
day
after
day
he
lay
with
little
apparent
change
no
pain
but
a
weakness
so
great
that
it
was
almost
harder
to
bear
than
sharp
suffering
would
have
been
nearly
every
day
alessandro
was
sent
for
to
play
or
sing
to
him
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
that
roused
him
from
his
half
lethargic
state
sometimes
he
would
talk
with
alessandro
on
matters
relative
to
the
estate
and
show
for
a
few
moments
something
like
his
old
animation
but
he
was
soon
tired
and
would
close
his
eyes
saying
i
will
speak
with
you
again
about
this
alessandro
i
am
going
to
sleep
now
the
senora
seeing
felipe
enjoyment
of
alessandro
presence
soon
came
to
have
a
warm
feeling
towards
him
herself
moreover
she
greatly
liked
his
quiet
reticence
there
was
hardly
a
surer
road
to
the
favor
for
man
or
woman
than
to
be
chary
of
speech
and
reserved
in
demeanor
she
had
an
instinct
of
kinship
to
all
that
was
silent
mysterious
in
human
nature
the
more
she
observed
alessandro
the
more
she
trusted
and
approved
him
luckily
for
juan
can
he
did
not
know
how
matters
were
working
in
his
mistress
mind
if
he
had
he
would
have
been
in
a
fever
of
apprehension
and
would
have
got
at
swords
points
with
alessandro
immediately
on
the
contrary
all
unaware
of
the
real
situation
of
affairs
and
never
quite
sure
that
the
mexican
he
dreaded
might
not
any
day
hear
of
his
misfortune
and
appear
asking
for
the
place
he
took
every
opportunity
to
praise
alessandro
to
the
senora
she
never
visited
his
bedside
that
he
had
not
something
to
say
in
favor
of
the
lad
as
he
called
him
truly
senora
he
said
again
and
again
i
do
marvel
where
the
lad
got
so
much
knowledge
at
his
age
he
is
like
an
old
hand
at
the
sheep
business
he
knows
more
than
any
shepherd
i
have
a
deal
more
and
it
is
not
only
of
sheep
he
has
had
experience
too
in
the
handling
of
cattle
juan
jose
has
been
beholden
to
him
more
than
once
already
for
a
remedy
of
which
he
knew
not
and
such
modesty
withal
i
knew
not
that
there
were
such
indians
surely
there
can
not
be
many
no
i
fancy
not
the
senora
would
reply
absently
his
father
is
a
man
of
intelligence
and
has
trained
his
son
there
is
nothing
he
is
not
ready
to
do
continued
eulogist
he
is
as
handy
with
tools
as
if
he
had
been
to
a
carpenter
he
has
made
me
a
new
splint
for
my
leg
which
was
a
relief
like
salve
to
a
wound
so
much
easier
was
it
than
before
he
is
a
good
lad
a
good
none
of
these
sayings
of
juan
were
thrown
away
on
the
senora
more
and
more
closely
she
watched
alessandro
and
the
very
thing
which
juan
had
feared
and
which
he
had
thought
to
avert
by
having
alessandro
his
temporary
substitute
was
slowly
coming
to
pass
the
idea
was
working
in
the
senora
mind
that
she
might
do
a
worse
thing
than
engage
this
young
strong
active
willing
man
to
remain
permanently
in
her
employ
the
possibility
of
an
indian
being
so
born
and
placed
that
he
would
hesitate
about
becoming
permanently
a
servant
even
to
the
senora
moreno
did
not
occur
to
her
however
she
would
do
nothing
hastily
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
before
juan
can
leg
was
well
she
would
study
the
young
man
more
in
the
mean
time
she
would
cause
felipe
to
think
of
the
idea
and
propose
it
so
one
day
she
said
to
felipe
what
a
voice
that
alessandro
has
felipe
we
shall
miss
his
music
sorely
when
he
goes
shall
we
not
he
not
going
exclaimed
felipe
startled
oh
no
no
not
at
present
he
agreed
to
stay
till
juan
can
was
about
again
but
that
will
be
not
more
than
six
weeks
now
or
eight
i
suppose
you
forget
how
time
has
flown
while
you
have
been
lying
here
ill
my
true
true
said
felipe
is
it
really
a
month
already
and
he
sighed
juan
can
tells
me
that
the
lad
has
a
marvellous
knowledge
for
one
of
his
years
continued
the
senora
he
says
he
is
as
skilled
with
cattle
as
with
sheep
knows
more
than
any
shepherd
we
have
on
the
place
he
seems
wonderfully
quiet
and
i
never
saw
an
indian
who
had
such
old
pablo
is
just
like
him
said
felipe
it
was
natural
enough
living
so
long
with
father
peyri
and
i
seen
other
indians
too
with
a
good
deal
the
same
manner
as
alessandro
it
born
in
i
ca
bear
the
idea
of
alessandro
going
away
but
by
that
time
you
will
be
well
and
strong
said
the
senora
you
would
not
miss
him
then
would
you
yes
i
would
too
said
felipe
pettishly
he
was
still
weak
enough
to
be
childish
i
like
him
about
me
he
worth
a
dozen
times
as
much
as
any
man
we
got
but
i
do
suppose
money
could
hire
him
to
stay
on
any
were
you
thinking
of
hiring
him
permanently
asked
the
senora
in
a
surprised
tone
i
do
doubt
you
could
do
so
if
you
wished
they
are
all
poor
i
suppose
he
would
not
work
with
the
shearers
if
he
were
not
oh
it
is
that
said
felipe
impatiently
you
ca
understand
because
you
never
been
among
them
but
they
are
just
as
proud
as
we
are
some
of
them
i
mean
such
men
as
old
pablo
they
shear
sheep
for
money
just
as
i
sell
wool
for
money
there
is
so
much
difference
alessandro
men
in
the
band
obey
him
and
all
the
men
in
the
village
obey
pablo
just
as
implicitly
as
my
men
here
obey
me
faith
much
more
so
added
felipe
laughing
you
ca
understand
it
mother
but
so
i
am
not
at
all
sure
i
could
offer
alessandro
assis
money
enough
to
tempt
him
to
stay
here
as
my
the
senora
nostrils
dilated
in
scorn
no
i
do
not
understand
it
she
said
most
certainly
i
do
not
understand
it
of
what
is
it
that
these
noble
lords
of
villages
are
so
proud
their
ancestors
naked
savages
less
than
a
hundred
years
ago
naked
savages
they
themselves
too
if
we
had
not
come
here
to
teach
and
civilize
them
the
race
was
never
meant
for
anything
but
servants
that
was
all
the
fathers
ever
expected
to
make
of
them
good
faithful
catholics
and
contented
laborers
in
the
fields
of
course
there
are
always
exceptional
instances
and
i
think
myself
alessandro
is
one
i
do
believe
however
he
is
so
exceptional
but
that
if
you
were
to
offer
him
for
instance
the
same
wages
you
pay
juan
can
he
would
jump
at
the
chance
of
staying
on
the
well
i
shall
think
about
it
said
felipe
i
like
nothing
better
than
to
have
him
here
always
he
a
fellow
i
heartily
like
i
think
about
which
was
all
the
senora
wanted
done
at
present
ramona
had
chanced
to
come
in
as
this
conversation
was
going
on
hearing
alessandro
name
she
seated
herself
at
the
window
looking
out
but
listening
intently
the
month
had
done
much
for
alessandro
with
ramona
though
neither
alessandro
nor
ramona
knew
it
it
had
done
this
much
that
ramona
knew
always
when
alessandro
was
near
that
she
trusted
him
and
that
she
had
ceased
to
think
of
him
as
an
indian
any
more
than
when
she
thought
of
felipe
she
thought
of
him
as
a
mexican
moreover
seeing
the
two
men
frequently
together
she
had
admitted
to
herself
as
margarita
had
done
before
her
that
alessandro
was
far
the
handsomer
man
of
the
two
this
ramona
did
not
like
to
admit
but
she
could
not
help
it
i
wish
felipe
were
as
tall
and
strong
as
alessandro
she
said
to
herself
many
a
time
i
do
not
see
why
he
could
not
have
been
i
wonder
if
the
senora
sees
how
much
handsomer
alessandro
when
felipe
said
that
he
did
not
believe
he
could
offer
alessandro
assis
money
enough
to
tempt
him
to
stay
on
the
place
ramona
opened
her
lips
suddenly
as
if
to
speak
then
changed
her
mind
and
remained
silent
she
had
sometimes
displeased
the
senora
by
taking
part
in
conversations
between
her
and
her
son
felipe
saw
the
motion
but
he
also
thought
it
wiser
to
wait
till
after
his
mother
had
left
the
room
before
he
asked
ramona
what
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
as
soon
as
the
senora
went
out
he
said
what
was
it
ramona
you
were
going
to
say
just
now
ramona
colored
she
had
decided
not
to
say
it
tell
me
ramona
persisted
felipe
you
were
going
to
say
something
about
alessandro
staying
i
know
you
ramona
did
not
answer
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
found
herself
embarrassed
before
felipe
do
you
like
alessandro
said
felipe
oh
yes
replied
ramona
with
instant
eagerness
it
was
not
that
at
all
i
like
him
very
much
but
then
she
stopped
well
what
is
it
then
have
you
heard
anything
on
the
place
about
his
staying
oh
no
no
not
a
word
said
ramona
everybody
understands
that
he
is
here
only
till
juan
can
gets
well
but
you
said
you
did
not
believe
you
could
offer
him
money
enough
to
tempt
him
to
well
said
felipe
inquiringly
i
do
not
do
you
i
think
he
would
like
to
stay
said
ramona
hesitatingly
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
what
makes
you
think
so
asked
felipe
i
do
know
ramona
said
still
more
hesitatingly
now
that
she
had
said
it
she
was
sorry
felipe
looked
curiously
at
her
hesitancy
like
this
doubts
uncertainty
as
to
her
impressions
were
not
characteristic
of
ramona
a
flitting
something
which
was
far
from
being
suspicion
or
jealousy
and
yet
was
of
kin
to
them
both
went
through
mind
went
through
so
swiftly
that
he
was
scarce
conscious
of
it
if
he
had
been
he
would
have
scorned
himself
jealous
of
an
indian
impossible
nevertheless
the
flitting
something
left
a
trace
and
prevented
felipe
from
forgetting
the
trivial
incident
and
after
this
it
was
certain
that
felipe
would
observe
ramona
more
closely
than
he
had
done
would
weigh
her
words
and
actions
and
if
she
should
seem
by
a
shade
altered
in
either
would
watch
still
more
closely
meshes
were
closing
around
ramona
three
watchers
of
her
every
look
and
act
alessandro
in
pure
love
margarita
in
jealous
hate
felipe
in
love
and
perplexity
only
the
senora
observed
her
not
if
she
had
matters
might
have
turned
out
very
differently
for
the
senora
was
rarely
mistaken
in
her
reading
of
people
motives
never
long
deceived
but
her
observing
and
discriminating
powers
were
not
in
focus
so
far
as
ramona
was
concerned
the
girl
was
curiously
outside
of
the
senora
real
life
shelter
food
clothes
all
external
needs
in
so
far
as
her
means
allowed
the
senora
would
without
fail
provide
for
the
child
her
sister
had
left
in
her
hands
as
a
trust
but
a
personal
relation
with
her
a
mother
affection
or
even
interest
and
acquaintance
no
the
senora
had
not
that
to
give
and
if
she
had
it
not
was
she
to
blame
what
could
she
do
years
ago
father
salvierderra
had
left
off
remonstrating
with
her
on
this
point
is
there
more
i
should
do
for
the
child
do
you
see
aught
lacking
aught
amiss
the
senora
would
ask
conscientiously
but
with
pride
and
the
father
thus
inquired
of
could
not
point
out
a
duty
which
had
been
neglected
you
do
not
love
her
my
daughter
he
said
senora
moreno
truthfulness
was
of
the
adamantine
order
no
i
do
not
i
can
not
one
can
not
love
by
act
of
that
is
true
the
father
would
say
sadly
but
affection
may
be
yes
if
it
exists
was
the
senora
constant
answer
but
in
this
case
it
does
not
exist
i
shall
never
love
ramona
only
at
your
command
and
to
save
my
sister
a
sorrow
i
took
her
i
will
never
fail
in
my
duty
to
it
was
of
no
use
as
well
say
to
the
mountain
be
cast
into
the
sea
as
try
to
turn
the
senora
heart
in
any
direction
whither
it
did
not
of
itself
tend
all
that
father
salvierderra
could
do
was
to
love
ramona
the
more
himself
which
he
did
heartily
and
more
and
more
each
year
and
small
marvel
at
it
for
a
gentler
sweeter
maiden
never
drew
breath
than
this
same
ramona
who
had
been
all
these
years
save
for
felipe
lonely
in
the
senora
moreno
house
three
watchers
of
ramona
now
if
there
had
been
a
fourth
and
that
fourth
herself
matters
might
have
turned
out
differently
but
how
should
ramona
watch
how
should
ramona
know
except
for
her
two
years
at
school
with
the
nuns
she
had
never
been
away
from
the
senora
house
felipe
was
the
only
young
man
she
had
known
felipe
her
brother
since
she
was
five
years
old
there
were
no
gayeties
in
the
senora
moreno
home
felipe
when
he
needed
them
went
one
day
journey
or
two
or
three
to
get
them
went
as
often
as
he
liked
ramona
never
went
how
many
times
she
had
longed
to
go
to
santa
barbara
or
to
monterey
or
los
angeles
but
to
have
asked
the
senora
permission
to
accompany
her
on
some
of
her
now
infrequent
journeys
to
these
places
would
have
required
more
courage
than
ramona
possessed
it
was
now
three
years
since
she
left
the
convent
school
but
she
was
still
as
fresh
from
the
hands
of
the
nuns
as
on
the
day
when
with
loving
tears
they
had
kissed
her
in
farewell
the
few
romances
and
tales
and
bits
of
verse
she
had
read
were
of
the
most
innocent
and
kind
and
left
her
hardly
less
childlike
than
before
this
childlikeness
combined
with
her
happy
temperament
had
kept
her
singularly
contented
in
her
monotonous
life
she
had
fed
the
birds
taken
care
of
the
flowers
kept
the
chapel
in
order
helped
in
light
household
work
embroidered
sung
and
as
the
senora
eight
years
before
had
bade
her
do
said
her
prayers
and
pleased
father
salvierderra
by
processes
strangely
unlike
she
and
alessandro
had
both
been
kept
strangely
free
from
thoughts
of
love
and
of
marriage
he
by
living
in
the
shadow
and
she
by
living
in
the
sun
his
heart
and
thoughts
filled
with
perplexities
and
fears
hers
filled
by
a
placid
routine
of
light
and
easy
tasks
and
the
outdoor
pleasures
of
a
child
as
the
days
went
on
and
felipe
still
remained
feeble
alessandro
meditated
a
bold
stroke
each
time
that
he
went
to
felipe
room
to
sing
or
to
play
he
felt
himself
oppressed
by
the
air
an
hour
of
it
made
him
uncomfortable
the
room
was
large
and
had
two
windows
and
the
door
was
never
shut
yet
the
air
seemed
to
alessandro
stifling
i
should
be
as
ill
as
the
senor
felipe
if
i
had
to
stay
in
that
room
and
a
bed
is
a
weakening
thing
enough
to
pull
the
strongest
man
down
said
alessandro
to
juan
can
one
day
do
you
think
i
should
anger
them
if
i
asked
them
to
let
me
bring
senor
felipe
out
to
the
veranda
and
put
him
on
a
bed
of
my
making
i
wager
my
head
i
put
him
on
his
feet
in
a
and
if
you
did
that
you
might
ask
the
senora
for
the
half
of
the
estate
and
get
it
lad
replied
juan
seeing
the
hot
blood
darkening
in
alessandro
face
at
his
words
he
hastened
to
add
do
not
be
so
i
meant
not
that
you
would
ask
any
reward
for
doing
it
i
was
only
thinking
what
joy
it
would
be
to
the
senora
to
see
senor
felipe
on
his
feet
again
it
has
often
crossed
my
thoughts
that
if
he
did
not
get
up
from
this
sickness
the
senora
would
not
be
long
behind
him
it
is
but
for
him
that
she
lives
and
who
would
have
the
estate
in
that
case
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
would
it
not
be
the
senorita
asked
alessandro
juan
can
laughed
an
ugly
laugh
ha
ha
let
the
senora
hear
you
say
that
he
said
faith
it
will
be
little
the
senorita
gets
more
than
enough
for
her
bread
may
be
out
of
the
moreno
estate
hark
ye
alessandro
if
you
will
not
tell
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
the
senorita
you
know
she
is
not
of
the
moreno
blood
is
no
relation
of
yes
said
alessandro
margarita
has
said
to
me
that
the
senorita
ramona
was
only
the
of
the
senora
repeated
juan
can
contemptuously
there
is
something
to
the
tale
i
know
not
nor
ever
could
find
out
for
when
i
was
in
monterey
the
ortegna
house
was
shut
and
i
could
not
get
speech
of
any
of
their
people
but
this
much
i
know
that
it
was
the
senora
ortegna
that
had
the
girl
first
in
keeping
and
there
was
a
scandalous
tale
about
her
if
juan
can
eyes
had
not
been
purblind
with
old
age
he
would
have
seen
that
in
alessandro
face
which
would
have
made
him
choose
his
words
more
carefully
but
he
went
on
it
was
after
the
senora
ortegna
was
buried
that
our
senora
returned
bringing
this
child
with
her
and
i
do
assure
you
lad
i
have
seen
the
senora
look
at
her
many
a
time
as
if
she
wished
her
dead
and
it
is
a
shame
for
she
was
always
as
fair
and
good
a
child
as
the
saints
ever
saw
but
a
stain
on
the
blood
a
stain
on
the
blood
lad
is
a
bitter
thing
in
a
house
this
much
i
know
her
mother
was
an
indian
once
when
i
was
in
the
chapel
behind
the
big
saint
joseph
there
i
overheard
the
senora
say
as
much
she
was
talking
to
father
salvierderra
and
she
said
the
child
had
only
the
one
blood
in
her
veins
it
would
be
different
i
like
not
these
crosses
with
indians
if
alessandro
had
been
civilized
he
would
at
this
word
indian
have
bounded
to
his
feet
being
alessandro
he
stood
if
possible
stiller
than
before
and
said
in
a
low
voice
how
know
you
it
was
the
mother
that
was
the
indian
juan
laughed
again
maliciously
ha
it
is
the
ortegna
face
she
has
and
that
ortegna
why
he
was
the
scandal
byword
of
the
whole
coast
there
was
not
a
decent
woman
would
have
spoken
to
him
except
for
his
wife
but
did
you
not
say
that
it
was
in
the
senora
ortegna
keeping
that
the
child
was
asked
alessandro
breathing
harder
and
faster
each
moment
now
stupid
old
juan
can
so
absorbed
in
relish
of
his
gossip
that
he
noticed
nothing
ay
ay
so
i
said
he
went
on
and
so
it
was
there
be
such
saints
you
know
though
the
lord
knows
if
she
had
been
minded
to
give
shelter
to
all
her
husband
bastards
she
might
have
taken
lease
of
a
church
to
hold
them
but
there
was
a
story
about
a
man
coming
with
this
infant
and
leaving
it
in
the
senora
room
and
she
poor
lady
never
having
had
a
child
of
her
own
did
warm
to
it
at
first
sight
and
kept
it
with
her
to
the
last
and
i
wager
me
a
hard
time
she
had
to
get
our
senora
to
take
the
child
when
she
died
except
that
it
was
to
spite
ortegna
i
think
our
senora
would
as
soon
the
child
had
been
has
she
not
treated
her
kindly
asked
alessandro
in
a
husky
voice
juan
can
pride
resented
this
question
do
you
suppose
the
senora
moreno
would
do
an
unkindness
to
one
under
her
roof
he
asked
loftily
the
senorita
has
been
always
in
all
things
like
senor
felipe
himself
it
was
so
that
she
promised
the
senora
ortegna
i
have
does
the
senorita
know
all
this
asked
alessandro
juan
can
crossed
himself
saints
save
us
no
he
exclaimed
i
not
forget
to
my
longest
day
what
it
cost
me
once
i
spoke
in
her
hearing
when
she
was
yet
small
i
did
not
know
she
heard
but
she
went
to
the
senora
asking
who
was
her
mother
and
she
said
i
had
said
her
mother
was
no
good
which
in
faith
i
did
and
no
wonder
and
the
senora
came
to
me
and
said
she
canito
you
have
been
a
long
time
in
our
house
but
if
ever
i
hear
of
your
mentioning
aught
concerning
the
senorita
ramona
on
this
estate
or
anywhere
else
in
the
country
that
day
you
leave
my
service
and
you
not
do
me
the
to
speak
of
it
alessandro
now
said
the
old
man
anxiously
my
tongue
runs
away
with
me
lying
here
on
this
cursed
bed
with
nothing
to
do
an
active
man
like
no
i
not
speak
of
it
you
may
be
assured
said
alessandro
walking
away
slowly
here
here
called
juan
what
about
that
plan
you
had
for
making
a
bed
for
senor
felipe
on
the
verandah
was
it
of
you
meant
ah
i
had
forgotten
said
alessandro
returning
yes
that
was
it
there
is
great
virtue
in
a
tight
stretched
my
father
says
that
it
is
the
only
bed
the
fathers
would
ever
sleep
on
in
the
mission
days
i
myself
like
the
ground
even
better
but
my
father
sleeps
always
on
the
rawhide
he
says
it
keeps
him
well
do
you
think
i
might
speak
of
it
to
the
senora
speak
of
it
to
senor
felipe
himself
said
juan
it
will
be
as
he
says
he
rules
this
place
now
from
beginning
to
end
and
it
is
but
yesterday
i
held
him
on
my
knee
it
is
soon
that
the
old
are
pushed
to
the
wall
nay
juan
canito
replied
alessandro
kindly
it
is
not
so
my
father
is
many
years
older
than
you
are
and
he
rules
our
people
as
firmly
as
ever
i
myself
obey
him
as
if
i
were
a
lad
what
else
then
but
a
lad
do
you
call
yourself
i
wonder
thought
juan
but
he
answered
it
is
not
so
with
us
the
old
are
not
held
in
such
that
is
not
well
replied
alessandro
we
have
been
taught
differently
there
is
an
old
man
in
our
village
who
is
many
many
years
older
than
my
father
he
helped
to
carry
the
mortar
at
the
building
of
the
san
diego
mission
i
do
not
know
how
many
years
ago
he
is
long
past
a
hundred
years
of
age
he
is
blind
and
childish
and
can
not
walk
but
he
is
cared
for
by
every
one
and
we
bring
him
in
our
arms
to
every
council
and
set
him
by
my
father
side
he
talks
very
foolishly
sometimes
but
my
father
will
not
let
him
be
interrupted
he
says
it
brings
bad
luck
to
affront
the
aged
we
will
presently
be
aged
ay
ay
said
juan
sadly
we
must
all
come
to
it
it
is
beginning
to
look
not
so
far
off
to
me
alessandro
stared
no
less
astonished
at
juan
can
unconscious
revelation
of
his
standard
of
measurement
of
years
than
juan
had
been
at
his
faith
old
man
what
name
dost
give
to
yourself
he
thought
but
went
on
with
the
topic
of
the
bed
i
may
not
so
soon
get
speech
with
senor
felipe
he
said
it
is
usually
when
he
is
sleepy
that
i
go
to
play
for
him
or
to
sing
but
it
makes
my
heart
heavy
to
see
him
thus
languishing
day
by
day
and
all
for
lack
of
the
air
and
the
sun
i
do
believe
indeed
ask
the
senorita
then
said
juan
she
has
his
ear
at
all
alessandro
made
no
answer
why
was
it
that
it
did
not
please
him
this
suggestion
of
speaking
to
ramona
of
his
plan
for
felipe
welfare
he
could
not
have
told
but
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
it
to
her
i
will
speak
to
the
senora
he
said
and
as
luck
would
have
it
at
that
moment
the
senora
stood
in
the
doorway
come
to
ask
after
juan
can
health
the
suggestion
of
the
bed
struck
her
favorably
she
herself
had
in
her
youth
heard
much
of
their
virtues
and
slept
on
them
yes
she
said
they
are
good
we
will
try
it
it
was
only
yesterday
that
senor
felipe
was
complaining
of
the
bed
he
lies
on
and
when
he
was
well
he
thought
nothing
could
be
so
good
he
brought
it
here
at
a
great
price
for
me
but
i
could
not
lie
on
it
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
throw
me
off
as
soon
as
i
lay
down
it
is
a
cheating
device
like
all
these
innovations
the
americans
have
brought
into
the
country
but
senor
felipe
till
now
thought
it
a
luxury
now
he
tosses
on
it
and
says
it
is
throwing
him
all
the
alessandro
smiled
in
spite
of
his
reverence
for
the
senora
i
once
lay
down
on
one
myself
senora
he
said
and
that
was
what
i
said
to
my
father
it
was
like
a
wild
horse
under
me
making
himself
ready
to
buck
i
thought
perhaps
the
invention
was
of
the
saints
that
men
should
not
sleep
too
there
is
a
pile
of
said
juan
well
cured
but
not
too
stiff
juan
jose
was
to
have
sent
them
off
to
be
sold
one
of
those
will
be
just
right
it
must
not
be
too
the
fresher
the
better
said
alessandro
so
it
have
no
dampness
shall
i
make
the
bed
senora
he
asked
and
will
the
senora
permit
that
i
make
it
on
the
veranda
i
was
just
asking
juan
can
if
he
thought
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
you
to
let
me
bring
senor
felipe
into
the
outer
air
with
us
it
is
thought
death
to
be
shut
up
in
walls
as
he
has
been
so
long
not
till
we
are
sure
to
die
do
we
go
into
the
dark
like
the
senora
hesitated
she
did
not
share
alessandro
prejudice
in
favor
of
fresh
air
night
and
day
both
she
said
surely
it
is
not
well
to
sleep
out
in
the
night
that
is
the
best
of
all
senora
replied
alessandro
earnestly
i
beg
the
senora
to
try
it
if
senor
felipe
have
not
mended
greatly
after
the
first
night
he
had
so
slept
then
alessandro
will
be
a
no
only
mistaken
said
the
senora
gently
she
felt
herself
greatly
drawn
to
this
young
man
by
his
devotion
as
she
thought
of
felipe
when
i
die
and
leave
felipe
here
she
had
more
than
once
said
to
herself
it
would
be
a
great
good
to
him
to
have
such
a
servant
as
this
on
the
very
well
alessandro
she
replied
make
the
bed
and
we
will
try
it
at
this
was
early
in
the
forenoon
the
sun
was
still
high
in
the
west
when
ramona
sitting
as
usual
in
the
veranda
at
her
embroidery
saw
alessandro
coming
followed
by
two
men
bearing
the
bed
what
can
that
be
she
said
some
new
invention
of
alessandro
but
for
what
a
bed
for
the
senor
felipe
senorita
said
alessandro
running
lightly
up
the
steps
the
senora
has
given
permission
to
place
it
here
on
the
veranda
and
senor
felipe
is
to
lie
here
day
and
night
and
it
will
be
a
marvel
in
your
eyes
how
he
will
gain
strength
it
is
the
close
room
which
is
keeping
him
weak
now
he
has
no
i
believe
that
is
the
truth
alessandro
exclaimed
ramona
i
have
been
thinking
the
same
thing
my
head
aches
after
i
am
in
that
room
but
an
hour
and
when
i
come
here
i
am
well
but
the
nights
too
alessandro
is
it
not
harmful
to
sleep
out
in
the
night
air
why
senorita
asked
alessandro
simply
and
ramona
had
no
answer
except
i
do
not
know
i
have
always
heard
my
people
do
not
think
so
replied
alessandro
unless
it
is
cold
we
like
it
better
it
is
good
senorita
to
look
up
at
the
sky
in
the
i
should
think
it
would
be
cried
ramona
i
never
thought
of
it
i
should
like
to
do
alessandro
was
busy
with
his
face
bent
down
arranging
the
bedstead
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
veranda
if
his
face
had
been
lifted
ramona
would
have
seen
a
look
on
it
that
would
have
startled
her
more
than
the
one
she
had
surprised
a
few
days
previous
after
the
incident
with
margarita
all
day
there
had
been
coming
and
going
in
alessandro
brain
a
confused
procession
of
thoughts
vague
yet
intense
put
in
words
they
would
have
been
found
to
be
little
more
than
ringing
changes
on
this
idea
the
senorita
ramona
has
indian
blood
in
her
veins
the
senorita
ramona
is
alone
the
senora
loves
her
not
indian
blood
indian
blood
these
or
something
like
them
would
have
been
the
words
but
alessandro
did
not
put
them
in
words
he
only
worked
away
on
the
rough
posts
for
senor
felipe
bedstead
hammered
fitted
stretched
the
and
made
it
tight
and
firm
driving
every
nail
striking
every
blow
with
a
bounding
sense
of
exultant
strength
as
if
there
were
suddenly
all
around
him
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
now
when
he
heard
ramona
say
suddenly
in
her
girlish
eager
tone
it
must
be
i
never
thought
of
it
i
should
like
to
try
it
these
vague
confused
thoughts
of
the
day
and
the
day
bounding
sense
of
exultant
strength
combined
in
a
quick
vision
before
alessandro
eyes
a
vision
of
starry
skies
overhead
ramona
and
himself
together
looking
up
to
them
but
when
he
raised
his
head
all
he
said
was
there
senorita
that
is
all
firm
now
if
senor
felipe
will
let
me
lay
him
an
this
bed
he
will
sleep
as
he
has
not
slept
since
he
fell
ramona
ran
eagerly
into
felipe
room
the
bed
is
all
ready
on
the
veranda
she
exclaimed
shall
alessandro
come
in
and
carry
you
out
felipe
looked
up
startled
the
senora
turned
on
ramona
that
expression
of
gentle
resigned
displeasure
which
always
hurt
the
girl
sensitive
nature
far
worse
than
anger
i
had
not
spoken
to
felipe
yet
of
the
change
ramona
she
said
i
supposed
that
alessandro
would
have
informed
me
when
the
bed
was
ready
i
am
sorry
you
came
in
so
suddenly
felipe
is
still
very
weak
you
what
is
it
what
is
it
exclaimed
felipe
impatiently
as
soon
as
it
was
explained
to
him
he
was
like
a
child
in
his
haste
to
be
moved
that
just
what
i
needed
he
exclaimed
this
cursed
bed
racks
every
bone
in
my
body
and
i
have
longed
for
the
sun
more
than
ever
a
thirsty
man
longed
for
water
bless
you
alessandro
he
went
on
seeing
alessandro
in
the
doorway
come
here
and
take
me
up
in
those
long
arms
of
yours
and
carry
me
quick
already
i
feel
myself
alessandro
lifted
him
as
if
he
were
a
baby
indeed
it
was
but
a
light
burden
now
felipe
wasted
body
for
a
man
much
less
strong
than
alessandro
to
lift
ramona
chilled
and
hurt
ran
in
advance
carrying
pillows
and
blankets
as
she
began
to
arrange
them
on
the
couch
the
senora
took
them
from
her
hands
saying
i
will
arrange
them
myself
and
waved
ramona
away
it
was
a
little
thing
ramona
was
well
used
to
such
ordinarily
it
would
have
given
her
no
pain
she
could
not
conceal
but
the
girl
nerves
were
not
now
in
equilibrium
she
had
had
hard
work
to
keep
back
her
tears
at
the
first
rebuff
this
second
was
too
much
she
turned
and
walked
swiftly
away
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
alessandro
saw
it
felipe
saw
it
to
felipe
the
sight
was
though
painful
not
a
surprise
he
knew
but
too
well
how
often
his
mother
hurt
ramona
all
he
thought
now
in
his
weakness
was
alas
what
a
pity
my
mother
does
not
love
ramona
to
alessandro
the
sight
was
the
one
drop
too
much
in
the
cup
as
he
stooped
to
lay
felipe
on
the
bed
he
trembled
so
that
felipe
looked
up
half
afraid
am
i
still
so
heavy
alessandro
he
said
smiling
it
is
not
your
weight
senor
felipe
answered
alessandro
off
guard
still
trembling
his
eyes
following
ramona
felipe
saw
in
the
next
second
the
eyes
of
the
two
young
men
met
alessandro
fell
before
felipe
felipe
gazed
on
steadily
at
alessandro
ah
he
said
and
as
he
said
it
he
closed
his
eyes
and
let
his
head
sink
back
into
the
pillow
is
that
comfortable
is
that
right
asked
the
senora
who
had
seen
nothing
the
first
comfortable
moment
i
have
had
mother
said
felipe
stay
alessandro
i
want
to
speak
to
you
as
soon
as
i
am
rested
this
move
has
shaken
me
up
a
good
deal
yes
senor
replied
alessandro
and
seated
himself
on
the
veranda
steps
if
you
are
to
stay
alessandro
said
the
senora
i
will
go
and
look
after
some
matters
that
need
my
attention
i
feel
always
at
ease
about
senor
felipe
when
you
are
with
him
you
will
stay
till
i
come
back
yes
senora
said
alessandro
in
a
tone
cold
as
the
senora
own
had
been
to
ramona
he
was
no
longer
in
heart
the
senora
moreno
servant
in
fact
he
was
at
that
very
moment
revolving
confusedly
in
his
mind
whether
there
could
be
any
possibility
of
his
getting
away
before
the
expiration
of
the
time
for
which
he
had
agreed
to
stay
it
was
a
long
time
before
felipe
opened
his
eyes
alessandro
thought
he
was
asleep
at
last
felipe
spoke
he
had
been
watching
alessandro
face
for
some
minutes
alessandro
he
said
alessandro
sprang
to
his
feet
and
walked
swiftly
to
the
bedside
he
did
not
know
what
the
next
word
might
be
he
felt
that
the
senor
felipe
had
seen
straight
into
his
heart
in
that
one
moment
look
and
alessandro
was
preparing
for
anything
alessandro
said
felipe
my
mother
has
been
speaking
to
me
about
your
remaining
with
us
permanently
juan
can
is
now
very
old
and
after
this
accident
will
go
on
crutches
the
rest
of
his
days
poor
soul
we
are
in
great
need
of
some
man
who
understands
sheep
and
the
care
of
the
place
as
he
spoke
he
watched
alessandro
face
closely
swift
changing
expressions
passed
over
it
surprise
predominated
felipe
misunderstood
the
surprise
i
knew
you
would
be
surprised
he
said
i
told
my
mother
that
you
would
not
think
of
it
that
you
had
stayed
now
only
because
we
were
in
alessandro
bowed
his
head
gratefully
this
recognition
from
felipe
gave
him
pleasure
yes
senor
he
said
that
was
it
i
told
father
salvierderra
it
was
not
for
the
wages
but
my
father
and
i
have
need
of
all
the
money
we
can
earn
our
people
are
very
poor
senor
i
do
not
know
whether
my
father
would
think
i
ought
to
take
the
place
you
offer
me
or
not
senor
it
would
be
as
he
said
i
will
ask
then
you
would
be
willing
to
take
it
asked
felipe
yes
senor
if
my
father
wished
me
to
take
it
replied
alessandro
looking
steadily
and
gravely
at
felipe
adding
after
a
pause
if
you
are
sure
that
you
desire
it
senor
felipe
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
be
of
help
to
and
yet
it
was
only
a
few
moments
ago
that
alessandro
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
possibility
of
leaving
the
senora
moreno
service
immediately
this
change
had
not
been
a
caprice
not
been
an
impulse
of
passionate
desire
to
remain
near
ramona
it
had
come
from
a
sudden
consciousness
that
the
senor
felipe
would
be
his
friend
and
alessandro
was
not
mistaken
ix
when
the
senora
came
back
to
the
veranda
she
found
felipe
asleep
alessandro
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
watching
him
as
the
senora
drew
near
alessandro
felt
again
the
same
sense
of
dawning
hatred
which
had
seized
him
at
her
harsh
speech
to
ramona
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
waited
to
be
dismissed
you
can
go
now
alessandro
said
the
senora
i
will
sit
here
you
are
quite
sure
that
it
will
be
safe
for
senor
felipe
to
sleep
here
all
night
it
will
cure
him
before
many
nights
replied
alessandro
still
without
raising
his
eyes
and
turning
to
go
stay
said
the
senora
alessandro
paused
it
will
not
do
for
him
to
be
alone
here
in
the
night
alessandro
had
thought
of
this
and
had
remembered
that
if
he
lay
on
the
veranda
floor
by
senor
felipe
side
he
would
also
lie
under
the
senorita
window
no
senora
he
replied
i
will
lie
here
by
his
side
that
was
what
i
had
thought
if
the
senora
is
thank
you
alessandro
said
the
senora
in
a
tone
which
would
have
surprised
poor
ramona
still
sitting
alone
in
her
room
with
sad
eyes
she
did
not
know
the
senora
could
speak
thus
sweetly
to
any
one
but
felipe
thank
you
you
are
kind
i
will
have
a
bed
made
for
oh
cried
alessandro
if
the
senora
will
excuse
me
i
could
not
lie
on
a
bed
a
like
senor
felipe
and
my
blanket
are
all
i
want
i
could
not
lie
on
any
to
be
sure
thought
the
senora
what
was
i
thinking
of
how
the
boy
makes
one
forget
he
is
an
indian
but
the
floor
is
harder
than
the
ground
alessandro
she
said
kindly
no
senora
he
said
it
is
all
one
and
i
will
not
sleep
i
will
watch
senor
felipe
in
case
there
should
be
a
wind
or
he
should
wake
and
need
i
will
watch
him
myself
till
midnight
said
the
senora
i
should
feel
easier
to
see
how
he
sleeps
at
it
was
the
balmiest
of
summer
nights
and
as
still
as
if
no
living
thing
were
on
the
earth
there
was
a
full
moon
which
shone
on
the
garden
and
on
the
white
front
of
the
little
chapel
among
the
trees
ramona
from
her
window
saw
alessandro
pacing
up
and
down
the
walk
she
had
seen
him
spread
down
the
by
felipe
bed
and
had
seen
the
senora
take
her
place
in
one
of
the
big
carved
chairs
she
wondered
if
they
were
both
going
to
watch
she
wondered
why
the
senora
would
never
let
her
sit
up
and
watch
with
felipe
i
am
not
of
any
use
to
anybody
she
thought
sadly
she
dared
not
go
out
and
ask
any
questions
about
the
arrangements
for
the
night
at
supper
the
senora
had
spoken
to
her
only
in
the
same
cold
and
distant
manner
which
always
made
her
dumb
and
afraid
she
had
not
once
seen
felipe
alone
during
the
day
margarita
who
in
the
former
times
ah
how
far
away
those
former
times
looked
now
had
been
a
greater
comfort
to
ramona
than
she
realized
margarita
now
was
sulky
and
silent
never
came
into
ramona
presence
if
she
could
help
it
and
looked
at
her
sometimes
with
an
expression
which
made
ramona
tremble
and
say
to
herself
she
hates
me
she
has
always
hated
me
since
that
it
had
been
a
long
sad
day
to
ramona
and
as
she
sat
in
her
window
leaning
her
head
against
the
sash
and
looked
at
alessandro
pacing
up
and
down
she
felt
for
the
first
time
and
did
not
shrink
from
it
nor
in
any
wise
disavow
or
disguise
it
to
herself
that
she
was
glad
he
loved
her
more
than
this
she
did
not
think
beyond
this
she
did
not
go
her
mind
was
not
like
margarita
full
of
fancies
bred
of
freedom
in
intercourse
with
men
but
distinctly
tenderly
glad
that
alessandro
loved
her
and
distinctly
tenderly
aware
how
well
he
loved
her
she
was
as
she
sat
at
her
window
this
night
looking
out
into
the
moonlit
garden
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
she
could
still
hear
his
slow
regular
steps
on
the
and
the
last
thought
she
had
as
she
fell
asleep
was
that
she
was
glad
alessandro
loved
her
the
moon
had
been
long
set
and
the
garden
trees
vines
were
all
wrapped
in
impenetrable
darkness
when
ramona
awoke
sat
up
in
her
bed
and
listened
all
was
so
still
that
the
sound
of
felipe
low
regular
breathing
came
in
through
her
open
window
after
hearkening
to
it
for
a
few
moments
she
rose
noiselessly
from
her
bed
and
creeping
to
the
window
parted
the
curtains
and
looked
out
noiselessly
she
thought
but
it
was
not
noiselessly
enough
to
escape
alessandro
quick
ear
without
a
sound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
at
window
i
am
here
senorita
he
whispered
do
you
want
anything
has
he
slept
all
night
like
this
she
whispered
back
yes
senorita
he
has
not
once
how
good
said
ramona
how
good
then
she
stood
still
she
wanted
to
speak
again
to
alessandro
to
hear
him
speak
again
but
she
could
think
of
no
more
to
say
because
she
could
not
she
gave
a
little
sigh
alessandro
took
one
swift
step
towards
the
window
may
the
saints
bless
you
senorita
he
whispered
fervently
thank
you
alessandro
murmured
ramona
and
glided
back
to
her
bed
but
not
to
sleep
it
lacked
not
much
of
dawn
as
the
first
faint
light
filtered
through
the
darkness
ramona
heard
the
senora
window
open
surely
she
will
not
strike
up
the
hymn
and
wake
felipe
thought
ramona
and
she
sprang
again
to
the
window
to
listen
a
few
low
words
between
the
senora
and
alessandro
and
then
the
senora
window
closed
again
and
all
was
still
i
thought
she
would
not
have
the
heart
to
wake
him
said
ramona
to
herself
the
virgin
would
have
had
no
pleasure
in
our
song
i
am
sure
but
i
will
say
a
prayer
to
her
instead
and
she
sank
on
her
knees
at
the
head
of
her
bed
and
began
saying
a
whispered
prayer
the
footfall
of
a
spider
in
ramona
room
had
not
been
light
enough
to
escape
the
ear
of
that
watching
lover
outside
again
alessandro
tall
figure
arose
from
the
floor
turning
towards
ramona
window
and
now
the
darkness
was
so
far
softened
to
dusk
that
the
outline
of
his
form
could
be
seen
ramona
felt
it
rather
than
saw
it
and
stopped
praying
alessandro
was
sure
he
had
heard
her
voice
did
the
senorita
speak
he
whispered
his
face
close
at
the
curtain
ramona
startled
dropped
her
rosary
which
rattled
as
it
fell
on
the
wooden
floor
no
no
alessandro
she
said
i
did
not
and
she
trembled
she
knew
not
why
the
sound
of
the
beads
on
the
floor
explained
to
alessandro
what
had
been
the
whispered
words
he
heard
she
was
at
her
prayers
he
thought
ashamed
and
sorry
forgive
me
he
whispered
i
thought
you
called
and
he
stepped
back
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
veranda
and
seated
himself
on
the
railing
he
would
lie
down
no
more
ramona
remained
on
her
knees
gazing
at
the
window
through
the
transparent
muslin
curtain
the
dawning
light
came
slowly
steadily
till
at
last
she
could
see
alessandro
distinctly
forgetful
of
all
else
she
knelt
gazing
at
him
the
rosary
lay
on
the
floor
forgotten
ramona
would
not
finish
that
prayer
that
day
but
her
heart
was
full
of
thanksgiving
and
gratitude
and
the
madonna
had
a
better
prayer
than
any
in
the
book
the
sun
was
up
and
the
canaries
finches
and
linnets
had
made
the
veranda
ring
with
joyous
racket
before
felipe
opened
his
eyes
the
senora
had
come
and
gone
and
come
again
looking
at
him
anxiously
but
he
stirred
not
ramona
had
stolen
timidly
out
glancing
at
alessandro
only
long
enough
to
give
him
one
quick
smile
and
bent
over
bed
holding
her
breath
he
lay
so
still
ought
he
to
sleep
so
long
she
whispered
till
the
noon
it
may
be
answered
alessandro
and
when
he
wakes
you
will
see
by
his
eye
that
he
is
another
it
was
indeed
so
when
felipe
first
looked
about
him
he
laughed
outright
with
pure
pleasure
then
catching
sight
of
alessandro
at
the
steps
he
called
in
a
stronger
voice
than
had
yet
been
heard
from
him
alessandro
you
are
a
famous
physician
why
could
that
fool
from
ventura
have
known
as
much
with
all
his
learning
he
had
had
me
in
the
next
world
before
many
days
except
for
you
now
alessandro
breakfast
i
hungry
i
had
forgotten
what
the
thought
of
food
was
like
to
a
hungry
stomach
and
plenty
plenty
he
called
as
alessandro
ran
toward
the
kitchen
bring
all
they
when
the
senora
saw
felipe
bolstered
up
in
the
bed
his
eye
bright
his
color
good
his
voice
clear
eating
heartily
like
his
old
self
she
stood
like
a
statue
in
the
middle
of
the
veranda
for
a
moment
then
turning
to
alessandro
she
said
chokingly
may
heaven
reward
you
and
disappeared
abruptly
in
her
own
room
when
she
came
out
her
eyes
were
red
all
day
she
moved
and
spoke
with
a
softness
unwonted
indeed
inconceivable
she
even
spoke
kindly
and
without
constraint
to
ramona
she
felt
like
one
brought
back
from
the
dead
after
this
a
new
sort
of
life
began
for
them
all
felipe
bed
on
the
veranda
was
the
rallying
point
for
everything
and
the
servants
came
to
look
up
at
him
and
wish
him
well
from
the
below
juan
can
when
he
first
hobbled
out
on
the
stout
crutches
alessandro
had
made
him
of
manzanita
wood
dragged
himself
all
the
way
round
the
house
to
have
a
look
at
senor
felipe
and
a
word
with
him
the
senora
sat
there
in
the
big
carved
chair
looking
like
a
sibyl
with
her
black
silk
banded
severely
straight
across
her
brow
and
her
large
dark
eyes
gazing
out
past
felipe
into
the
far
south
sky
ramona
lived
there
too
with
her
embroidery
or
her
book
sitting
on
cushions
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
or
at
the
foot
of
felipe
bed
always
so
placed
however
if
anybody
had
noticed
but
nobody
did
so
placed
that
she
could
look
at
felipe
without
looking
full
at
the
senora
chair
even
if
the
senora
were
not
in
it
here
also
came
alessandro
many
times
a
day
sometimes
sent
for
sometimes
of
his
own
accord
he
was
freely
welcome
when
he
played
or
sang
he
sat
on
the
upper
step
of
the
stairs
leading
down
to
the
garden
he
also
had
a
secret
which
he
thought
all
his
own
in
regard
to
the
positions
he
chose
he
sat
always
when
ramona
was
there
in
the
spot
which
best
commanded
a
view
of
her
face
the
secret
was
not
all
his
own
felipe
knew
it
nothing
was
escaping
felipe
in
these
days
a
exploding
at
their
feet
would
not
have
more
astonished
the
different
members
of
this
circle
the
senora
ramona
alessandro
than
it
would
to
have
been
made
suddenly
aware
of
the
thoughts
which
were
going
on
in
felipe
mind
now
from
day
to
day
as
he
lay
there
placidly
looking
at
them
all
it
is
probable
that
if
felipe
had
been
in
full
health
and
strength
when
the
revelation
suddenly
came
to
him
that
alessandro
loved
ramona
and
that
ramona
might
love
alessandro
he
would
have
been
instantly
filled
with
jealous
antagonism
but
at
the
time
when
this
revelation
came
he
was
prostrate
feeble
thinking
many
times
a
day
that
he
must
soon
die
it
did
not
seem
to
felipe
that
a
man
could
be
so
weak
as
he
was
and
ever
again
be
strong
and
well
side
by
side
with
these
forebodings
of
his
own
death
always
came
the
thought
of
ramona
what
would
become
of
her
if
he
were
gone
only
too
well
he
knew
that
the
girl
heart
would
be
broken
that
she
could
not
live
on
alone
with
his
mother
felipe
adored
his
mother
but
he
understood
her
feeling
about
ramona
with
his
feebleness
had
also
come
to
felipe
as
is
often
the
case
in
long
illnesses
a
greater
clearness
of
perception
ramona
had
ceased
to
puzzle
him
he
no
longer
asked
himself
what
her
long
steady
look
into
his
eyes
meant
he
knew
he
saw
it
mean
that
as
a
sister
she
loved
him
had
always
loved
him
and
could
love
him
in
no
other
way
he
wondered
a
little
at
himself
that
this
gave
him
no
more
pain
only
a
sort
of
sweet
mournful
tenderness
towards
her
it
must
be
because
he
was
so
soon
going
out
of
the
world
he
thought
presently
he
began
to
be
aware
that
a
new
quality
was
coming
into
his
love
for
her
he
himself
was
returning
to
the
brother
love
which
he
had
had
for
her
when
they
were
children
together
and
in
which
he
had
felt
no
change
until
he
became
a
man
and
ramona
a
woman
it
was
strange
what
a
peace
fell
upon
felipe
when
this
was
finally
clear
and
settled
in
his
mind
no
doubt
he
had
had
more
misgiving
and
fear
about
his
mother
in
the
matter
than
he
had
ever
admitted
to
himself
perhaps
also
the
consciousness
of
unfortunate
birth
had
rankled
at
times
but
all
this
was
past
now
ramona
was
his
sister
he
was
her
brother
what
course
should
he
pursue
in
the
crisis
which
he
saw
drawing
near
how
could
he
best
help
ramona
what
would
be
best
for
both
her
and
alessandro
long
before
the
thought
of
any
possible
union
between
himself
and
ramona
had
entered
into
alessandro
mind
still
longer
before
it
had
entered
into
ramona
to
think
of
alessandro
as
a
husband
felipe
had
spent
hours
in
forecasting
plotting
and
planning
for
them
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
himself
in
the
dark
as
to
his
mother
probable
action
that
any
concern
as
to
ramona
personal
happiness
or
welfare
would
influence
her
he
knew
better
than
to
think
for
a
moment
so
far
as
that
was
concerned
ramona
might
wander
out
the
next
hour
wife
of
a
homeless
beggar
and
his
mother
would
feel
no
regret
but
ramona
had
been
the
adopted
daughter
of
the
senora
ortegna
bore
the
ortegna
name
and
had
lived
as
in
the
house
of
the
morenos
would
the
senora
permit
such
a
one
to
marry
an
indian
felipe
doubted
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
he
doubted
the
more
he
watched
the
more
he
saw
that
the
question
might
soon
have
to
be
decided
any
hour
might
precipitate
it
he
made
plan
after
plan
for
forestalling
trouble
for
preparing
his
mother
but
felipe
was
by
nature
indolent
and
now
he
was
in
addition
feeble
day
after
day
slipped
by
it
was
exceedingly
pleasant
on
the
veranda
ramona
was
usually
with
him
his
mother
was
gentler
less
sad
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
alessandro
was
always
at
hand
ready
for
any
service
in
the
field
in
the
house
his
music
a
delight
his
strength
and
fidelity
a
repose
his
personal
presence
always
agreeable
if
only
my
mother
could
think
it
reflected
felipe
it
would
be
the
best
thing
all
round
to
have
alessandro
stay
here
as
overseer
of
the
place
and
then
they
might
be
married
perhaps
before
the
summer
is
over
she
will
come
to
see
it
and
the
delicious
languid
summer
came
hovering
over
the
valley
the
apricots
turned
golden
the
peaches
glowed
the
grapes
filled
and
hardened
like
opaque
emeralds
hung
thick
under
the
canopied
vines
the
garden
was
a
shade
brown
and
the
roses
had
all
fallen
but
there
were
lilies
and
and
poppies
and
carnations
and
geraniums
in
the
pots
and
musk
oh
yes
ever
and
always
musk
it
was
like
an
enchanter
spell
the
knack
the
senora
had
of
forever
keeping
relays
of
musk
to
bloom
all
the
year
and
it
was
still
more
like
an
enchanter
spell
that
felipe
would
never
confess
that
he
hated
it
but
the
bees
liked
it
and
the
the
butterflies
also
and
the
air
was
full
of
them
the
veranda
was
a
quieter
place
now
as
the
season
noon
grew
near
the
linnets
were
all
nesting
and
the
finches
and
the
canaries
too
and
the
senora
spent
hours
every
day
tirelessly
feeding
the
mothers
the
vines
had
all
grown
and
spread
out
to
their
thickest
no
need
any
longer
of
the
gay
blanket
alessandro
had
pinned
up
that
first
morning
to
keep
the
sun
off
felipe
head
what
was
the
odds
between
a
and
a
in
such
a
spot
as
this
said
felipe
i
will
speak
to
my
mother
and
and
but
he
did
not
there
was
one
close
observer
of
these
pleasant
veranda
days
that
felipe
knew
nothing
about
that
was
margarita
as
the
girl
came
and
went
about
her
household
tasks
she
was
always
on
the
watch
for
alessandro
on
the
watch
for
ramona
she
was
biding
her
time
just
what
shape
her
revenge
was
going
to
take
she
did
not
know
it
was
no
use
plotting
it
must
be
as
it
fell
out
but
that
the
hour
and
the
way
for
her
revenge
would
come
she
never
doubted
when
she
saw
the
group
on
the
veranda
as
she
often
did
all
listening
to
alessandro
violin
or
to
his
singing
alessandro
himself
now
at
his
ease
and
free
in
the
circle
as
if
he
had
been
there
always
her
anger
was
almost
beyond
bounds
oh
ho
like
a
member
of
the
family
quite
so
she
sneered
it
is
new
times
when
a
head
shepherd
spends
his
time
with
the
ladies
of
the
house
and
sits
in
their
presence
like
a
guest
who
is
invited
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
what
comes
of
all
this
and
she
knew
not
which
she
hated
the
more
of
the
two
alessandro
or
ramona
since
the
day
of
the
scene
at
the
she
had
never
spoken
to
alessandro
and
had
avoided
so
far
as
was
possible
seeing
him
at
first
alessandro
was
sorry
for
this
and
tried
to
be
friendly
with
her
as
soon
as
he
felt
assured
that
the
incident
had
not
hurt
him
at
all
in
the
esteem
of
ramona
he
began
to
be
sorry
for
margarita
a
man
should
not
be
rude
to
any
maiden
he
thought
and
he
hated
to
remember
how
he
had
pushed
margarita
from
him
and
snatched
his
hand
away
when
he
had
in
the
outset
made
no
objection
to
her
taking
it
but
resentment
was
not
to
be
appeased
she
understood
only
too
clearly
how
little
alessandro
gentle
advances
meant
and
she
would
none
of
them
let
him
go
to
his
senorita
she
said
bitterly
mocking
the
reverential
tone
in
which
she
had
overheard
him
pronounce
the
word
she
is
fond
enough
of
him
if
only
the
fool
had
eyes
to
see
it
she
be
ready
to
throw
herself
at
his
head
before
long
if
this
kind
of
thing
keeps
up
is
not
well
to
speak
thus
freely
of
young
men
margarita
ha
ha
little
i
thought
that
day
which
way
the
wind
set
in
my
temper
i
wager
she
reproves
me
no
more
under
this
roof
or
any
other
curse
her
what
did
she
want
of
alessandro
except
to
turn
his
head
and
then
bid
him
go
his
way
to
do
margarita
justice
she
never
once
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
ramona
wedding
alessandro
a
clandestine
affair
an
intrigue
of
more
or
less
intensity
such
as
she
herself
might
have
carried
on
with
any
one
of
the
shepherds
this
was
the
utmost
stretch
of
margarita
angry
imaginations
in
regard
to
her
young
mistress
liking
for
alessandro
there
was
not
in
her
way
of
looking
at
things
any
impossibility
of
such
a
thing
as
that
but
marriage
it
might
be
questioned
whether
that
idea
would
have
been
any
more
startling
to
the
senora
herself
than
to
margarita
little
had
passed
between
alessandro
and
ramona
which
margarita
did
not
know
the
girl
was
always
like
a
sprite
here
there
everywhere
in
an
hour
and
with
eyes
which
as
her
mother
often
told
her
saw
on
all
sides
of
her
head
now
fired
by
her
new
purpose
new
passion
she
moved
swifter
than
ever
and
saw
and
heard
even
more
there
were
few
hours
of
any
day
when
she
did
not
know
to
a
certainty
where
both
alessandro
and
ramona
were
and
there
had
been
few
meetings
between
them
which
she
had
not
either
seen
or
surmised
in
the
simple
life
of
such
a
household
as
the
senora
it
was
not
strange
that
this
was
possible
nevertheless
it
argued
and
involved
untiring
vigilance
on
margarita
part
even
felipe
who
thought
himself
from
his
of
observation
on
the
veranda
and
from
his
familiar
relation
with
ramona
well
informed
of
most
that
happened
would
have
been
astonished
to
hear
all
that
margarita
could
have
told
him
in
the
first
days
ramona
herself
had
guilelessly
told
him
much
had
told
him
how
alessandro
seeing
her
trying
to
sprinkle
and
bathe
and
keep
alive
the
green
ferns
with
which
she
had
decorated
the
chapel
for
father
salvierderra
coming
had
said
oh
senorita
they
are
dead
do
not
take
trouble
with
them
i
will
bring
you
fresh
ones
and
the
next
morning
she
had
found
lying
at
the
chapel
door
a
pile
of
such
ferns
as
she
had
never
before
seen
tall
ones
like
six
and
eight
feet
high
the
feathery
maidenhair
and
the
gold
fern
and
the
silver
twice
as
large
as
she
ever
had
found
them
the
chapel
was
beautiful
like
a
conservatory
after
she
had
arranged
them
in
vases
and
around
the
high
candlesticks
it
was
alessandro
too
who
had
picked
up
in
the
all
of
the
last
year
which
had
not
been
trampled
down
by
the
cattle
and
bringing
one
to
her
had
asked
shyly
if
she
did
not
think
it
prettier
than
flowers
made
out
of
paper
his
people
he
said
made
wreaths
of
them
and
so
they
were
more
beautiful
than
any
paper
flowers
which
ever
were
made
great
soft
round
disks
of
fine
straight
threads
like
silk
with
a
kind
of
saint
halo
around
them
of
sharp
stiff
points
glossy
as
satin
and
of
a
lovely
creamy
color
it
was
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
nobody
had
ever
noticed
them
as
they
lay
there
on
the
ground
she
had
put
a
great
wreath
of
them
around
saint
joseph
head
and
a
bunch
in
the
madonna
hand
and
when
the
senora
saw
them
she
exclaimed
in
admiration
and
thought
they
must
have
been
made
of
silk
and
satin
and
alessandro
had
brought
her
beautiful
baskets
made
by
the
indian
women
at
pala
and
one
which
had
come
from
the
north
from
the
tulare
country
it
had
gay
feathers
woven
in
with
the
reeds
red
and
yellow
in
alternate
rows
round
and
round
it
was
like
a
basket
made
out
of
a
bird
and
a
beautiful
stone
bowl
alessandro
had
brought
her
glossy
black
that
came
all
the
way
from
catalina
island
a
friend
of
alessandro
got
it
for
the
first
few
weeks
it
had
seemed
as
if
hardly
a
day
passed
that
there
was
not
some
new
token
to
be
chronicled
of
thoughtfulness
and
often
too
ramona
had
much
to
tell
that
alessandro
had
said
tales
of
the
old
mission
days
that
he
had
heard
from
his
father
stories
of
saints
and
of
the
early
fathers
who
were
more
like
saints
than
like
men
alessandro
said
father
junipero
who
founded
the
first
missions
and
father
crespi
his
friend
grandfather
had
journeyed
with
father
crespi
as
his
servant
and
many
a
miracle
he
had
with
his
own
eyes
seen
father
crespi
perform
there
was
a
cup
out
of
which
the
father
always
took
his
chocolate
for
breakfast
a
beautiful
cup
which
was
carried
in
a
box
the
only
luxury
the
father
had
and
one
morning
it
was
broken
and
everybody
was
in
terror
and
despair
never
mind
never
mind
said
the
father
i
will
make
it
whole
and
taking
the
two
pieces
in
his
hands
he
held
them
tight
together
and
prayed
over
them
and
they
became
one
solid
piece
again
and
it
was
used
all
through
the
journey
just
as
before
but
now
ramona
never
spoke
voluntarily
of
alessandro
to
sometimes
artfully
put
questions
or
allusions
to
him
she
made
brief
replies
and
never
continued
the
topic
and
felipe
had
observed
another
thing
she
now
rarely
looked
at
alessandro
when
he
was
speaking
to
others
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
if
he
addressed
her
she
looked
quickly
up
at
him
but
lowered
her
eyes
after
the
first
glance
alessandro
also
observed
this
and
was
glad
of
it
he
understood
it
he
knew
how
differently
she
could
look
in
his
face
in
the
rare
moments
when
they
were
alone
together
he
fondly
thought
he
alone
knew
this
but
he
was
mistaken
margarita
knew
she
had
more
than
once
seen
it
it
had
happened
more
than
once
that
he
had
found
ramona
at
the
willows
by
the
brook
and
had
talked
with
her
there
the
first
time
it
happened
it
was
a
chance
after
that
never
a
chance
again
for
alessandro
went
often
seeking
the
spot
hoping
to
find
her
in
ramona
mind
too
not
avowed
but
half
consciously
there
was
if
not
the
hope
of
seeing
him
there
at
least
the
memory
that
it
was
there
they
had
met
it
was
a
pleasant
spot
cool
and
shady
even
at
noon
and
the
running
water
always
full
of
music
ramona
often
knelt
there
of
a
morning
washing
out
a
bit
of
lace
or
a
handkerchief
and
when
alessandro
saw
her
it
went
hard
with
him
to
stay
away
at
such
moments
the
vision
returned
to
him
vividly
of
that
first
night
when
for
the
first
second
seeing
her
face
in
the
sunset
glow
he
had
thought
her
scarce
mortal
it
was
not
that
he
even
now
thought
her
less
a
saint
but
ah
how
well
he
knew
her
to
be
human
he
had
gone
alone
in
the
dark
to
this
spot
many
a
time
and
lying
on
the
grass
put
his
hands
into
the
running
water
and
played
with
it
dreamily
thinking
in
his
poetic
indian
fashion
thoughts
like
these
whither
have
gone
the
drops
that
passed
beneath
her
hands
just
here
these
drops
will
never
find
those
in
the
sea
but
i
love
this
water
margarita
had
seen
him
thus
lying
and
without
dreaming
of
the
refined
sentiment
which
prompted
his
action
had
yet
groped
blindly
towards
it
thinking
to
herself
he
hopes
his
senorita
will
come
down
to
him
there
a
nice
place
it
is
for
a
lady
to
meet
her
lover
at
the
it
will
take
swifter
water
than
any
in
that
brook
senorita
ramona
to
wash
you
white
in
the
senora
eyes
if
ever
she
come
upon
you
there
with
the
head
shepherd
making
free
with
him
may
be
oh
but
if
that
could
only
happen
i
die
content
and
the
more
margarita
watched
the
more
she
thought
it
not
unlikely
that
it
might
turn
out
so
it
was
oftener
at
the
willows
than
anywhere
else
that
ramona
and
alessandro
met
and
as
margarita
noticed
with
malicious
satisfaction
they
talked
each
time
longer
each
time
parted
more
lingeringly
several
times
it
had
happened
to
be
near
and
margarita
with
one
eye
on
the
had
hovered
restlessly
near
the
senora
hoping
to
be
ordered
to
call
the
senorita
to
supper
if
but
i
could
come
on
them
of
a
sudden
and
say
to
her
as
she
did
to
me
are
wanted
in
the
house
oh
but
it
would
do
my
soul
good
say
it
so
it
would
sting
like
a
lash
laid
on
both
their
faces
it
will
come
it
will
come
it
will
be
there
that
she
be
caught
one
of
these
fine
times
she
having
i
wait
it
will
come
x
it
came
and
when
it
came
it
fell
out
worse
for
ramona
than
most
malicious
hopes
had
pictured
but
margarita
had
no
hand
in
it
it
was
the
senora
herself
since
felipe
had
so
far
gained
as
to
be
able
to
be
dressed
sit
in
his
chair
on
the
veranda
and
walk
about
the
house
and
garden
a
little
the
senora
at
ease
in
her
mind
about
him
had
resumed
her
old
habit
of
long
lonely
walks
on
the
place
it
had
been
well
said
by
her
servants
that
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
on
the
estate
that
the
senora
had
not
seen
she
knew
every
inch
of
her
land
she
had
a
special
purpose
in
walking
over
it
now
she
was
carefully
examining
to
see
whether
she
could
afford
to
sell
to
the
ortegas
a
piece
of
which
they
greatly
desired
to
buy
as
it
joined
a
pasturage
tract
of
theirs
this
bit
of
land
lay
farther
from
the
house
than
the
senora
realized
and
it
had
taken
more
time
than
she
thought
it
would
to
go
over
it
and
it
was
already
sunset
on
this
eventful
day
when
hurrying
home
she
turned
off
from
the
highway
into
the
same
shortcut
path
in
which
father
salvierderra
had
met
ramona
in
the
spring
there
was
no
difficulty
now
in
getting
through
the
mustard
tangle
it
was
parched
and
dry
and
had
been
trampled
by
cattle
the
senora
walked
rapidly
but
it
was
dusky
twilight
when
she
reached
the
willows
so
dusky
that
she
saw
nothing
and
she
stepped
so
lightly
on
the
smooth
brown
path
that
she
made
no
sound
until
suddenly
face
to
face
with
a
man
and
a
woman
standing
locked
in
each
other
arms
she
halted
stepped
back
a
pace
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
in
the
same
second
recognized
the
faces
of
the
two
who
stricken
dumb
stood
apart
each
gazing
into
her
face
with
terror
strangely
enough
it
was
ramona
who
spoke
first
terror
for
herself
had
stricken
her
dumb
terror
for
alessandro
gave
her
a
voice
senora
she
began
silence
shameful
creature
cried
the
senora
do
not
dare
to
speak
go
to
your
room
ramona
did
not
move
as
for
you
the
senora
continued
turning
to
alessandro
you
she
was
about
to
say
you
are
discharged
from
my
service
from
this
hour
but
recollecting
herself
in
time
said
you
will
answer
to
senor
felipe
out
of
my
sight
and
the
senora
moreno
actually
for
once
in
her
life
beside
herself
with
rage
stamped
her
foot
on
the
ground
out
of
my
sight
she
repeated
alessandro
did
not
stir
except
to
turn
towards
ramona
with
an
inquiring
look
he
would
run
no
risk
of
doing
what
she
did
not
wish
he
had
no
idea
what
she
would
think
it
best
to
do
in
this
terrible
dilemma
go
alessandro
said
ramona
calmly
still
looking
the
senora
full
in
the
eye
alessandro
obeyed
before
the
words
had
left
her
lips
he
had
walked
away
ramona
composure
and
alessandro
waiting
for
further
orders
than
her
own
before
stirring
from
the
spot
were
too
much
for
senora
moreno
a
wrath
such
as
she
had
not
felt
since
she
was
young
took
possession
of
her
as
ramona
opened
her
lips
again
saying
senora
the
senora
did
a
shameful
deed
she
struck
the
girl
on
the
mouth
a
cruel
blow
speak
not
to
me
she
cried
again
and
seizing
her
by
the
arm
she
pushed
rather
than
dragged
her
up
the
senora
you
hurt
my
arm
said
ramona
still
in
the
same
calm
voice
you
need
not
hold
me
i
will
go
with
you
i
am
not
was
this
ramona
the
senora
already
ashamed
let
go
the
arm
and
stared
in
the
girl
face
even
in
the
twilight
she
could
see
upon
it
an
expression
of
transcendent
peace
and
a
resolve
of
which
no
one
would
have
thought
it
capable
what
does
this
mean
thought
the
senora
still
weak
and
trembling
all
over
from
rage
the
hussy
the
hypocrite
and
she
seized
the
arm
again
this
time
ramona
did
not
remonstrate
but
submitted
to
being
led
like
a
prisoner
pushed
into
her
own
room
the
door
slammed
violently
and
locked
on
the
outside
all
of
which
margarita
saw
she
had
known
for
an
hour
that
ramona
and
alessandro
were
at
the
willows
and
she
had
been
consumed
with
impatience
at
the
senora
prolonged
absence
more
than
once
she
had
gone
to
felipe
and
asked
with
assumed
interest
if
he
were
not
hungry
and
if
he
and
the
senorita
would
not
have
their
supper
no
no
not
till
the
senora
returns
felipe
had
answered
he
too
happened
this
time
to
know
where
ramona
and
alessandro
were
he
knew
also
where
the
senora
had
gone
and
that
she
would
be
late
home
but
he
did
not
know
that
there
would
be
any
chance
of
her
returning
by
way
of
the
willows
at
the
brook
if
he
had
known
it
he
would
have
contrived
to
summon
ramona
when
margarita
saw
ramona
shoved
into
her
room
by
the
pale
and
trembling
senora
saw
the
key
turned
taken
out
and
dropped
into
the
pocket
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
and
ran
into
the
back
porch
almost
a
remorse
seized
her
she
remembered
in
a
flash
how
often
ramona
had
helped
her
in
times
gone
by
sheltered
her
from
the
displeasure
she
recollected
the
torn
holy
virgin
what
will
be
done
to
her
now
she
exclaimed
under
her
breath
margarita
had
never
conceived
of
such
an
extremity
as
this
disgrace
and
a
sharp
reprimand
and
a
sundering
of
all
relations
with
alessandro
this
was
all
margarita
had
meant
to
draw
down
on
ramona
head
but
the
senora
looked
as
if
she
might
kill
her
she
always
did
hate
her
in
her
heart
reflected
margarita
she
sha
starve
her
to
death
anyhow
i
never
stand
by
and
see
that
but
it
must
have
been
something
shameful
the
senora
saw
to
have
brought
her
to
such
a
pass
as
this
and
margarita
jealousy
again
got
the
better
of
her
sympathy
good
enough
for
her
no
more
than
she
deserved
an
honest
fellow
like
alessandro
that
would
make
a
good
husband
for
any
girl
margarita
remorse
was
over
she
was
an
enemy
again
it
was
an
odd
thing
how
identical
were
margarita
and
the
view
and
interpretation
of
the
situation
the
senora
looking
at
it
from
above
and
margarita
looking
at
it
from
below
each
was
sure
and
they
were
both
equally
sure
that
it
could
be
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
disgraceful
intrigue
mistress
and
maid
were
alike
incapable
either
of
conjecturing
or
of
believing
the
truth
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
or
was
it
good
luck
felipe
also
had
witnessed
the
scene
in
the
hearing
voices
he
had
looked
out
of
his
window
and
almost
doubting
the
evidence
of
his
senses
had
seen
his
mother
violently
dragging
ramona
by
the
arm
ramona
pale
but
strangely
placid
his
mother
with
rage
and
fury
in
her
white
face
the
sight
told
its
own
tale
to
felipe
smiting
his
forehead
with
his
hand
he
groaned
out
fool
that
i
was
to
let
her
be
surprised
she
has
come
on
them
unawares
now
she
will
never
never
forgive
it
and
felipe
threw
himself
on
his
bed
to
think
what
should
be
done
presently
he
heard
his
mother
voice
still
agitated
calling
his
name
he
remained
silent
sure
she
would
soon
seek
him
in
his
room
when
she
entered
and
seeing
him
on
the
bed
came
swiftly
towards
him
saying
felipe
dear
are
you
ill
he
replied
in
a
feeble
voice
no
mother
only
tired
a
little
and
as
she
bent
over
him
anxious
alarmed
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
neck
and
kissed
her
warmly
mother
mia
he
said
passionately
what
should
i
do
without
you
the
caress
the
loving
words
acted
like
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
they
restored
the
senora
as
nothing
else
could
what
mattered
anything
so
long
as
she
had
her
adoring
and
adorable
son
and
she
would
not
speak
to
him
now
that
he
was
so
tired
of
this
disgraceful
and
vexing
matter
of
alessandro
it
could
wait
till
morning
she
would
send
him
his
supper
in
his
room
and
he
would
not
miss
ramona
perhaps
i
will
send
your
supper
here
felipe
she
said
you
must
not
overdo
you
have
been
walking
too
much
lie
and
kissing
him
affectionately
she
went
to
the
where
margarita
vainly
trying
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
happened
was
standing
ready
to
serve
supper
when
the
senora
entered
with
her
countenance
composed
and
in
her
ordinary
tones
said
margarita
you
can
take
senor
felipe
supper
into
his
room
he
is
lying
down
and
will
not
get
up
he
is
tired
margarita
was
ready
to
doubt
if
she
had
not
been
in
a
nightmare
dream
had
she
or
had
she
not
within
the
last
seen
the
senora
shaking
and
speechless
with
rage
push
the
senorita
ramona
into
her
room
and
lock
her
up
there
she
was
so
bewildered
that
she
stood
still
and
gazed
at
the
senora
with
her
mouth
wide
open
what
are
you
staring
at
girl
asked
the
senora
so
sharply
that
margarita
jumped
oh
nothing
nothing
senora
and
the
senorita
will
she
come
to
supper
shall
i
call
her
she
said
the
senora
eyed
her
had
she
seen
could
she
have
seen
the
senora
moreno
was
herself
again
so
long
as
ramona
was
under
her
roof
no
matter
what
she
herself
might
do
or
say
to
the
girl
no
servant
should
treat
her
with
disrespect
or
know
that
aught
was
wrong
the
senorita
is
not
well
she
said
coldly
she
is
in
her
room
i
myself
will
take
her
some
supper
later
if
she
wishes
it
do
not
disturb
and
the
senora
returned
to
felipe
margarita
chuckled
inwardly
and
proceeded
to
clear
the
table
she
had
spread
with
such
malicious
punctuality
two
short
hours
before
in
those
two
short
hours
how
much
had
happened
small
appetite
for
supper
will
our
senorita
have
i
reckon
said
the
bitter
margarita
and
the
senor
alessandro
also
i
curious
to
see
how
he
will
carry
but
her
curiosity
was
not
gratified
alessandro
came
not
to
the
kitchen
the
last
of
the
herdsmen
had
eaten
and
gone
it
was
past
nine
and
no
alessandro
slyly
margarita
ran
out
and
searched
in
some
of
the
places
where
she
knew
he
was
in
the
habit
of
going
but
alessandro
was
not
to
be
found
once
she
brushed
so
near
his
that
he
thought
he
was
discovered
and
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
but
luckily
held
his
peace
and
she
passed
on
alessandro
was
hid
behind
the
geranium
clump
at
the
chapel
door
sitting
on
the
ground
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
chin
watching
ramona
window
he
intended
to
stay
there
all
night
he
felt
that
he
might
be
needed
if
ramona
wanted
him
she
would
either
open
her
window
and
call
or
would
come
out
and
go
down
through
the
to
the
willows
in
either
case
he
would
see
her
from
the
he
had
chosen
he
was
racked
by
his
emotions
mad
with
joy
one
minute
sick
at
heart
with
misgiving
the
next
ramona
loved
him
she
had
told
him
so
she
had
said
she
would
go
away
with
him
and
be
his
wife
the
words
had
but
just
passed
her
lips
at
that
dreadful
moment
when
the
senora
appeared
in
their
presence
as
he
lived
the
scene
over
again
he
the
joy
and
the
terror
equally
what
was
not
that
terrible
senora
capable
of
doing
why
did
she
look
at
him
and
at
ramona
with
such
loathing
scorn
since
she
knew
that
the
senorita
was
half
indian
why
should
she
think
it
so
dreadful
a
thing
for
her
to
marry
an
indian
man
it
did
not
once
enter
into
mind
that
the
senora
could
have
had
any
other
thought
seeing
them
as
she
did
in
each
other
arms
and
again
what
had
he
to
give
to
ramona
could
she
live
in
a
house
such
as
he
must
live
in
live
as
the
temecula
women
lived
no
for
her
sake
he
must
leave
his
people
must
go
to
some
town
must
do
he
knew
not
what
something
to
earn
more
money
anguish
seized
him
as
he
pictured
to
himself
ramona
suffering
deprivations
the
more
he
thought
of
the
future
in
this
light
the
more
his
joy
faded
and
his
fear
grew
he
had
never
had
sufficient
hope
that
she
could
be
his
to
look
forward
thus
to
the
practical
details
of
life
he
had
only
gone
on
loving
and
in
a
vague
way
dreaming
and
hoping
and
now
now
in
a
moment
all
had
been
changed
in
a
moment
he
had
spoken
and
she
had
spoken
and
such
words
once
spoken
there
was
no
going
back
and
he
had
put
his
arms
around
her
and
felt
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
kissed
her
yes
he
alessandro
had
kissed
the
senorita
ramona
and
she
had
been
glad
of
it
and
had
kissed
him
on
the
lips
as
no
maiden
kisses
a
man
unless
she
will
wed
with
him
him
alessandro
oh
no
wonder
the
man
brain
whirled
as
he
sat
there
in
the
silent
darkness
wondering
afraid
helpless
his
love
wrenched
from
him
in
the
very
instant
of
their
first
kiss
wrenched
from
him
and
he
himself
ordered
by
one
who
had
the
right
to
order
him
to
begone
what
could
an
indian
do
against
a
moreno
would
felipe
help
him
ay
there
was
felipe
that
felipe
was
his
friend
alessandro
knew
with
a
knowledge
as
sure
as
the
wild
instinct
for
the
shelter
of
her
brood
but
could
felipe
move
the
senora
oh
that
terrible
senora
what
would
become
of
them
as
in
the
instant
of
drowning
men
are
said
to
review
in
a
second
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
so
in
this
supreme
moment
of
love
there
flashed
through
his
mind
vivid
pictures
of
every
word
and
act
of
ramona
since
he
first
knew
her
he
recollected
the
tone
in
which
she
had
said
and
the
surprise
with
which
he
heard
her
say
it
at
the
time
of
felipe
fall
you
are
alessandro
are
you
not
he
heard
again
her
prayers
the
first
night
felipe
slept
on
the
veranda
he
recalled
her
tender
distress
because
the
shearers
had
had
no
dinner
the
evident
terribleness
to
her
of
a
person
going
one
whole
day
without
food
o
god
will
she
always
have
food
each
day
if
she
comes
with
me
he
said
and
at
the
bare
thought
he
was
ready
to
flee
away
from
her
forever
then
he
recalled
her
look
and
her
words
only
a
few
hours
ago
when
he
first
told
her
he
loved
her
and
his
heart
took
courage
she
had
said
i
know
you
love
me
alessandro
and
i
am
glad
of
it
and
had
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
with
all
the
love
that
a
woman
eyes
can
carry
and
when
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
she
had
of
her
own
accord
come
closer
and
laid
one
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
turned
her
face
to
his
ah
what
else
mattered
there
was
the
whole
world
if
she
loved
him
like
this
nothing
could
make
them
wretched
his
love
would
be
enough
for
her
and
for
him
hers
was
an
empire
it
was
indeed
true
though
neither
the
senora
nor
margarita
would
have
believed
it
that
this
had
been
the
first
word
of
love
ever
spoken
between
alessandro
and
ramona
the
first
caress
ever
given
the
first
moment
of
unreserve
it
had
come
about
as
lovers
first
words
first
caresses
are
so
apt
to
do
unexpectedly
with
no
more
premonition
at
the
instant
than
there
is
of
the
instant
of
the
opening
of
a
flower
alessandro
had
been
speaking
to
ramona
of
the
conversation
felipe
had
held
with
him
in
regard
to
remaining
on
the
place
and
asked
her
if
she
knew
of
the
plan
yes
she
said
i
heard
the
senora
talking
about
it
with
felipe
some
days
was
she
against
my
staying
asked
alessandro
quickly
i
think
not
said
ramona
but
i
am
not
sure
it
is
not
easy
to
be
sure
what
the
senora
wishes
till
afterward
it
was
felipe
that
proposed
this
somewhat
enigmatical
statement
as
to
the
difficulty
of
knowing
the
senora
wishes
was
like
greek
to
alessandro
mind
i
do
not
understand
senorita
he
said
what
do
you
mean
by
i
mean
replied
ramona
that
the
senora
never
says
she
wishes
anything
she
says
she
leaves
everything
to
felipe
to
decide
or
to
father
salvierderra
but
i
think
it
is
always
decided
as
she
wishes
to
have
it
after
all
the
senora
is
wonderful
alessandro
do
you
think
so
she
loves
senor
felipe
very
much
was
alessandro
evasive
reply
oh
yes
exclaimed
ramona
you
do
not
begin
to
know
how
much
she
does
not
love
any
other
human
being
he
takes
it
all
she
has
any
left
if
he
had
died
she
would
have
died
too
that
is
the
reason
she
likes
you
so
much
she
thinks
you
saved
felipe
life
i
mean
that
is
one
reason
added
ramona
smiling
and
looking
up
confidingly
at
alessandro
who
smiled
back
not
in
vanity
but
honest
gratitude
that
the
senorita
was
pleased
to
intimate
that
he
was
not
unworthy
of
the
senora
regard
i
do
not
think
she
likes
me
he
said
i
can
not
tell
why
but
i
do
not
think
she
likes
any
one
in
the
world
she
is
not
like
any
one
i
ever
saw
no
replied
ramona
thoughtfully
she
is
not
i
am
oh
so
afraid
of
her
alessandro
i
have
always
been
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
to
think
she
hated
me
but
now
i
think
she
does
not
care
one
way
or
the
other
if
i
keep
out
of
her
while
ramona
spoke
these
words
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
running
water
at
her
feet
if
she
had
looked
up
and
seen
the
expression
in
alessandro
eyes
as
he
listened
the
thing
which
was
drawing
near
would
have
drawn
near
faster
would
have
arrived
at
that
moment
but
she
did
not
look
up
she
went
on
little
dreaming
how
hard
she
was
making
it
for
alessandro
many
the
time
i
come
down
here
at
night
to
this
brook
and
looked
at
it
and
wished
it
was
a
big
river
so
i
could
throw
myself
in
and
be
carried
away
out
to
the
sea
dead
but
it
is
a
fearful
sin
father
salvierderra
says
to
take
one
own
life
and
always
the
next
morning
when
the
sun
came
out
and
the
birds
sang
i
been
glad
enough
i
had
not
done
it
were
you
ever
so
unhappy
as
that
alessandro
no
senorita
never
replied
alessandro
and
it
is
thought
a
great
disgrace
among
us
to
kill
one
self
i
think
i
could
never
do
it
but
oh
senorita
it
is
a
grief
to
think
of
your
being
unhappy
will
you
always
be
so
must
you
always
stay
here
oh
but
i
am
not
always
unhappy
said
ramona
with
her
sunny
little
laugh
indeed
i
am
generally
very
happy
father
salvierderra
says
that
if
one
does
no
sin
one
will
be
always
happy
and
that
it
is
a
sin
not
to
rejoice
every
hour
of
the
day
in
the
sun
and
the
sky
and
the
work
there
is
to
do
and
there
is
always
plenty
of
then
her
face
clouding
she
continued
i
suppose
i
shall
always
stay
here
i
have
no
other
home
you
know
i
was
the
senora
sister
adopted
child
she
died
when
i
was
little
and
the
senora
kindly
took
me
father
salvierderra
says
i
must
never
forget
to
be
grateful
to
her
for
all
she
has
done
for
me
and
i
try
not
alessandro
eyed
her
closely
the
whole
story
as
juan
can
had
told
it
to
him
of
the
girl
birth
was
burning
in
his
thoughts
how
he
longed
to
cry
out
o
my
loved
one
they
have
made
you
homeless
in
your
home
they
despise
you
the
blood
of
my
race
is
in
your
veins
come
to
me
come
to
me
be
surrounded
with
love
but
he
dared
not
how
could
he
dare
some
strange
spell
seemed
to
have
unloosed
ramona
tongue
she
had
never
before
spoken
to
alessandro
of
her
own
personal
history
or
burdens
but
she
went
on
the
worst
thing
is
alessandro
that
she
will
not
tell
me
who
my
mother
was
and
i
do
not
know
if
she
is
alive
or
not
or
anything
about
her
once
i
asked
the
senora
but
she
forbade
me
ever
to
ask
her
again
she
said
she
herself
would
tell
me
when
it
was
proper
for
me
to
know
but
she
never
how
the
secret
trembled
on
alessandro
lips
now
ramona
had
never
seemed
so
near
so
intimate
so
trusting
what
would
happen
if
he
were
to
tell
her
the
truth
would
the
sudden
knowledge
draw
her
closer
to
him
or
repel
her
have
you
never
asked
her
again
he
said
ramona
looked
up
astonished
no
one
ever
disobeyed
the
senora
she
said
quickly
i
would
exclaimed
alessandro
you
may
think
so
said
ramona
but
you
could
when
you
tried
you
would
find
you
could
i
did
ask
father
salvierderra
what
did
he
say
asked
alessandro
breathless
the
same
thing
he
said
i
must
not
ask
i
was
not
old
enough
when
the
time
came
i
would
be
told
answered
ramona
sadly
i
do
see
what
they
can
mean
by
the
time
coming
what
do
you
suppose
they
meant
i
do
not
know
the
ways
of
any
people
but
my
own
senorita
replied
alessandro
many
things
that
your
people
do
and
still
more
that
these
americans
do
are
to
me
so
strange
i
know
nothing
what
they
mean
perhaps
they
do
not
know
who
was
your
mother
i
am
sure
they
do
answered
ramona
in
a
low
tone
as
if
the
words
were
wrung
from
her
but
let
us
talk
about
something
else
alessandro
not
about
sad
things
about
pleasant
things
let
us
talk
about
your
staying
would
it
be
truly
a
pleasure
to
the
senorita
ramona
if
i
stayed
said
alessandro
you
know
it
would
answered
ramona
frankly
yet
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
which
alessandro
felt
i
do
not
see
what
we
could
any
of
us
do
without
you
felipe
says
he
shall
not
let
you
alessandro
face
glowed
it
must
be
as
my
father
says
senorita
he
said
a
messenger
came
from
him
yesterday
and
i
sent
him
back
with
a
letter
telling
him
what
the
senor
felipe
had
proposed
to
me
and
asking
him
what
i
should
do
my
father
is
very
old
senorita
and
i
do
not
see
how
he
can
well
spare
me
i
am
his
only
child
and
my
mother
died
years
ago
we
live
alone
together
in
our
house
and
when
i
am
away
he
is
very
lonely
but
he
would
like
to
have
me
earn
the
wages
i
know
and
i
hope
he
will
think
it
best
for
me
to
stay
there
are
many
things
we
want
to
do
for
the
village
most
of
our
people
are
poor
and
can
do
little
more
than
get
what
they
need
to
eat
day
by
day
and
my
father
wishes
to
see
them
better
off
before
he
dies
now
that
the
americans
are
coming
in
all
around
us
he
is
afraid
and
anxious
all
the
time
he
wants
to
get
a
big
fence
built
around
our
land
so
as
to
show
where
it
is
but
the
people
can
not
take
much
time
to
work
on
the
fence
they
need
all
their
time
to
work
for
themselves
and
their
families
indians
have
a
hard
time
to
live
now
senorita
were
you
ever
in
temecula
no
said
ramona
is
it
a
large
town
alessandro
sighed
dear
senorita
it
is
not
a
town
it
is
only
a
little
village
not
more
than
twenty
houses
in
all
and
some
of
those
are
built
only
of
tule
there
is
a
chapel
and
a
graveyard
we
built
an
adobe
wall
around
the
graveyard
last
year
that
my
father
said
we
would
do
before
we
built
the
fence
round
the
how
many
people
are
there
in
the
village
asked
ramona
nearly
two
hundred
when
they
are
all
there
but
many
of
them
are
away
most
of
the
time
they
must
go
where
they
can
get
work
they
are
hired
by
the
farmers
or
to
do
work
on
the
great
ditches
or
to
go
as
shepherds
and
some
of
them
take
their
wives
and
children
with
them
i
do
not
believe
the
senorita
has
ever
seen
any
very
poor
oh
yes
i
have
alessandro
at
santa
barbara
there
were
many
poor
people
there
and
the
sisters
used
to
give
them
food
every
indians
said
alessandro
ramona
colored
yes
she
said
some
of
them
were
but
not
like
your
men
alessandro
they
were
very
different
miserable
looking
they
could
not
read
nor
write
and
they
seemed
to
have
no
that
is
the
trouble
said
alessandro
with
so
many
of
them
it
is
with
my
father
people
too
they
say
is
the
use
my
father
gets
in
despair
with
them
because
they
will
not
learn
better
he
gives
them
a
great
deal
but
they
do
not
seem
to
be
any
better
off
for
it
there
is
only
one
other
man
in
our
village
who
can
read
and
write
besides
my
father
and
me
senorita
and
yet
my
father
is
all
the
time
begging
them
to
come
to
his
house
and
learn
of
him
but
they
say
they
have
no
time
and
indeed
there
is
much
truth
in
that
senorita
you
see
everybody
has
troubles
ramona
had
been
listening
with
sorrowful
face
all
this
was
new
to
her
until
neither
she
nor
alessandro
had
spoken
of
private
and
personal
matters
ah
but
these
are
real
troubles
she
said
i
do
not
think
mine
were
real
troubles
at
all
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
your
people
alessandro
if
the
village
were
only
near
by
i
could
teach
them
could
i
not
i
could
teach
them
to
read
the
sisters
always
said
that
to
teach
the
ignorant
and
the
poor
was
the
noblest
work
one
could
do
i
wish
i
could
teach
your
people
have
you
any
relatives
there
besides
your
father
is
there
any
one
in
the
village
that
you
love
alessandro
alessandro
was
too
much
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
his
people
to
observe
the
hesitating
emphasis
with
which
ramona
asked
this
question
yes
senorita
i
love
them
all
they
are
like
my
brothers
and
sisters
all
of
my
father
people
he
said
and
i
am
unhappy
about
them
all
the
during
the
whole
of
this
conversation
ramona
had
had
an
undercurrent
of
thought
going
on
which
was
making
her
uneasy
the
more
alessandro
said
about
his
father
and
his
people
the
more
she
realized
that
he
was
held
to
temecula
by
bonds
that
would
be
hard
to
break
the
more
she
feared
his
father
would
not
let
him
remain
away
from
home
for
any
length
of
time
at
the
thought
of
his
going
away
her
very
heart
sickened
taking
a
sudden
step
towards
him
she
said
abruptly
alessandro
i
am
afraid
your
father
will
not
give
his
consent
to
your
staying
so
am
i
senorita
he
replied
sadly
and
you
would
not
stay
if
he
did
not
approve
of
it
of
course
she
said
how
could
i
senorita
no
she
said
it
would
not
be
right
but
as
she
said
these
words
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
alessandro
saw
them
the
world
changed
in
that
second
senorita
senorita
ramona
he
cried
tears
have
come
in
your
eyes
o
senorita
then
you
will
not
be
angry
if
i
say
that
i
love
you
and
alessandro
trembled
with
the
terror
and
delight
of
having
said
the
words
hardly
did
he
trust
his
palpitating
senses
to
be
telling
him
true
the
words
that
followed
quick
firm
though
only
in
a
whisper
i
know
that
you
love
me
alessandro
and
i
am
glad
of
it
yes
this
was
what
the
senorita
ramona
was
saying
and
when
he
stammered
but
you
senorita
you
do
not
you
could
not
yes
alessandro
i
do
i
love
you
in
the
same
clear
firm
whisper
and
the
next
minute
arms
were
around
ramona
and
he
had
kissed
her
sobbing
rather
than
saying
o
senorita
do
you
mean
that
you
will
go
with
me
that
you
are
mine
oh
no
beloved
senorita
you
can
not
mean
that
but
he
was
kissing
her
he
knew
she
did
mean
it
and
ramona
whispering
yes
alessandro
i
do
mean
it
i
will
go
with
you
clung
to
him
with
her
hands
and
kissed
him
and
repeated
it
i
will
go
with
you
i
love
and
then
just
then
came
the
senora
step
and
her
sharp
cry
of
amazement
and
there
she
stood
no
more
than
an
away
looking
at
them
with
her
indignant
terrible
eyes
what
an
hour
this
for
alessandro
to
be
living
over
and
over
as
he
crouched
in
the
darkness
watching
but
the
bewilderment
of
his
emotions
did
not
dull
his
senses
as
if
stalking
deer
in
a
forest
he
listened
for
sounds
from
the
house
it
seemed
strangely
still
as
the
darkness
deepened
it
seemed
still
stranger
that
no
lamps
were
lit
darkness
in
the
senora
room
in
the
senorita
a
faint
light
in
the
soon
put
out
evidently
no
supper
going
on
there
only
from
under
felipe
door
streamed
a
faint
radiance
and
creeping
close
to
the
veranda
alessandro
heard
voices
fitfully
talking
the
senora
and
felipe
no
word
from
ramona
piteously
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
window
it
was
open
but
the
curtains
tight
drawn
no
stir
no
sound
where
was
she
what
had
been
done
to
his
love
only
the
tireless
caution
and
infinite
patience
of
his
indian
blood
kept
alessandro
from
going
to
her
window
but
he
would
imperil
nothing
by
acting
on
his
own
responsibility
he
would
wait
if
it
were
till
daylight
till
his
love
made
a
sign
certainly
before
long
senor
felipe
would
come
to
his
veranda
bed
and
then
he
could
venture
to
speak
to
him
but
it
was
near
midnight
when
the
door
of
felipe
room
opened
and
he
and
his
mother
came
out
still
speaking
in
low
tones
felipe
lay
down
on
his
couch
his
mother
bending
over
kissed
him
bade
him
and
went
into
her
own
room
it
had
been
some
time
now
since
alessandro
had
left
off
sleeping
on
the
veranda
floor
by
felipe
side
felipe
was
so
well
it
was
not
needful
but
felipe
felt
sure
he
would
come
and
was
not
surprised
when
a
few
minutes
after
the
senora
door
closed
he
heard
a
low
voice
through
the
vines
senor
felipe
hush
alessandro
whispered
felipe
do
not
make
a
sound
morning
early
i
will
see
you
behind
the
little
sheepfold
it
is
not
safe
to
talk
where
is
the
senorita
alessandro
breathed
rather
than
said
in
her
room
answered
felipe
well
said
alessandro
yes
said
felipe
hoping
he
was
not
lying
and
this
was
all
alessandro
had
to
comfort
himself
with
through
his
long
night
of
watching
no
not
all
one
other
thing
comforted
him
the
notes
of
two
that
at
intervals
he
heard
cooing
to
each
other
just
the
two
notes
the
call
and
the
answer
love
love
here
and
long
intervals
of
silence
between
plain
as
if
written
on
a
page
was
the
thing
they
told
that
is
what
my
ramona
is
like
thought
he
the
gentle
if
she
is
my
wife
my
people
will
call
her
majel
the
xi
when
the
senora
bade
felipe
she
did
not
go
to
bed
after
closing
her
door
she
sat
down
to
think
what
should
be
done
about
ramona
it
had
been
a
hard
task
she
had
set
herself
talking
all
the
evening
with
felipe
without
alluding
to
the
topic
uppermost
in
her
mind
but
felipe
was
still
nervous
and
irritable
she
would
not
spoil
his
night
rest
she
thought
by
talking
of
disagreeable
things
moreover
she
was
not
clear
in
her
own
mind
what
she
wished
to
have
done
about
alessandro
if
ramona
were
to
be
sent
away
to
the
nuns
which
was
the
only
thing
the
senora
could
think
of
as
yet
there
would
be
no
reason
for
discharging
alessandro
and
with
him
the
senora
was
by
no
means
ready
to
part
though
in
her
first
anger
she
had
been
ready
to
dismiss
him
on
the
spot
as
she
pursued
her
reflections
the
whole
situation
cleared
itself
in
her
mind
so
easily
do
affairs
fall
into
line
in
the
plottings
and
plannings
of
an
arbitrary
person
who
makes
in
his
formula
no
allowance
for
a
human
element
which
he
can
not
control
ramona
should
be
sent
in
disgrace
to
the
sisters
school
to
be
a
servant
there
for
the
rest
of
her
life
the
senora
would
wash
her
hands
of
her
forever
even
father
salvierderra
himself
could
not
expect
her
any
longer
to
keep
such
a
shameless
creature
under
her
roof
her
sister
written
instructions
had
provided
for
the
possibility
of
just
such
a
contingency
going
to
a
secret
closet
in
the
wall
behind
a
statue
of
saint
catharine
the
senora
took
out
an
iron
box
battered
and
rusty
with
age
and
set
it
on
the
bed
the
key
turned
with
difficulty
in
the
lock
it
was
many
years
since
the
senora
had
opened
this
box
no
one
but
herself
knew
of
its
existence
there
had
been
many
times
in
the
history
of
the
moreno
house
when
the
price
of
the
contents
of
that
box
would
have
averted
loss
and
misfortune
but
the
senora
no
more
thought
of
touching
the
treasure
than
if
it
had
been
guarded
by
angels
with
fiery
swords
there
they
lay
brilliant
and
shining
even
in
the
dim
light
of
the
one
candle
rubies
emeralds
pearls
and
yellow
diamonds
the
senora
lip
curled
as
she
looked
at
them
fine
dowry
truly
for
a
creature
like
this
she
said
well
i
knew
in
the
beginning
no
good
would
come
of
it
base
begotten
base
born
she
has
but
carried
out
the
instincts
of
her
nature
i
suppose
i
may
be
grateful
that
my
own
son
was
too
pure
to
be
her
prey
to
be
given
to
my
adopted
daughter
ramona
ortegna
on
her
wedding
day
so
the
instructions
ran
if
she
weds
worthily
and
with
your
approval
should
such
a
misfortune
occur
which
i
do
not
anticipate
as
that
she
should
prove
unworthy
then
these
jewels
and
all
i
have
left
to
her
of
value
shall
be
the
property
of
the
no
mention
as
to
what
i
am
to
do
with
the
girl
herself
if
she
proves
unworthy
thought
the
senora
bitterly
but
the
church
is
the
place
for
her
no
other
keeping
will
save
her
from
the
lowest
depths
of
disgrace
i
recollect
my
sister
said
that
angus
had
at
first
intended
to
give
the
infant
to
the
church
would
to
god
he
had
done
so
or
left
it
with
its
indian
mother
and
the
senora
rose
and
paced
the
floor
the
paper
of
her
dead
sister
handwriting
fell
at
her
feet
as
she
walked
her
long
skirt
swept
it
rustling
to
and
fro
she
stooped
picked
it
up
read
it
again
with
increasing
bitterness
no
softness
at
the
memory
of
her
sister
love
for
the
little
child
no
relenting
unworthy
yes
that
was
a
mild
word
to
apply
to
ramona
now
it
was
all
settled
and
when
the
girl
was
once
out
of
the
house
the
senora
would
breathe
easier
she
and
felipe
would
lead
their
lives
together
and
felipe
would
wed
some
day
was
there
a
woman
fair
enough
good
enough
for
felipe
to
wed
but
he
must
wed
and
the
place
would
be
gay
with
children
voices
and
ramona
would
be
forgotten
the
senora
did
not
know
how
late
it
was
i
will
tell
her
she
said
i
will
lose
no
time
and
now
she
shall
hear
who
her
mother
was
it
was
a
strange
freak
of
just
impulse
in
the
senora
angry
soul
which
made
her
suddenly
remember
that
ramona
had
had
no
supper
and
led
her
to
go
to
the
kitchen
get
a
jug
of
milk
and
some
bread
and
take
them
to
the
room
turning
the
key
cautiously
that
felipe
might
not
hear
she
opened
the
door
and
glided
in
no
voice
greeted
her
she
held
her
candle
high
up
no
ramona
in
sight
the
bed
was
empty
she
glanced
at
the
window
it
was
open
a
terror
seized
the
senora
fresh
anger
also
she
has
run
off
with
alessandro
she
thought
what
horrible
standing
motionless
she
heard
a
faint
regular
breathing
from
the
other
side
of
the
bed
hastily
crossing
the
room
she
saw
a
sight
which
had
melted
a
heart
that
was
only
ice
but
the
senora
was
stone
toward
ramona
there
lay
ramona
on
the
floor
her
head
on
a
pillow
at
the
feet
of
the
big
madonna
which
stood
in
the
corner
her
left
hand
was
under
her
cheek
her
right
arm
flung
tight
around
the
base
of
the
statue
she
was
sound
asleep
her
face
was
wet
with
tears
her
whole
attitude
was
full
of
significance
even
helpless
in
sleep
she
was
one
who
had
taken
refuge
in
sanctuary
this
thought
had
been
distinct
in
the
girl
mind
when
she
found
herself
spite
of
all
her
woe
and
terror
growing
sleepy
she
wo
dare
to
hurt
me
at
the
virgin
feet
she
had
said
and
the
window
is
open
felipe
would
hear
if
i
called
and
alessandro
will
and
with
a
prayer
on
her
lips
she
fell
asleep
it
was
felipe
nearness
more
than
the
madonna
which
saved
her
from
being
roused
to
hear
her
doom
the
senora
stood
for
some
moments
looking
at
her
and
at
the
open
window
with
a
hot
rush
of
disgraceful
suspicions
she
noted
what
she
had
never
before
thought
of
that
alessandro
through
all
his
watching
with
felipe
had
had
close
access
to
ramona
window
shameful
creature
she
repeated
to
herself
and
she
can
sleep
it
is
well
she
prayed
if
the
virgin
will
hear
such
and
she
turned
away
first
setting
down
the
jug
of
milk
and
the
bread
on
a
table
then
with
a
sudden
and
still
more
curious
mingling
of
justness
in
her
wrath
she
returned
and
lifting
the
coverlet
from
the
bed
spread
it
over
ramona
covering
her
carefully
from
head
to
foot
then
she
went
out
and
again
locked
the
door
felipe
from
his
bed
heard
and
divined
all
but
made
no
sound
thank
god
the
poor
child
is
asleep
he
said
and
my
poor
dear
mother
feared
to
awake
me
by
speaking
to
her
what
will
become
of
us
all
and
felipe
tossed
and
turned
and
had
barely
fallen
into
an
uneasy
sleep
when
his
mother
window
opened
and
she
sang
the
first
line
of
the
sunrise
hymn
instantly
ramona
joined
evidently
awake
and
ready
and
no
sooner
did
the
watching
alessandro
hear
the
first
note
of
her
voice
than
he
struck
in
and
margarita
who
had
been
up
for
an
hour
prowling
listening
peering
wondering
her
soul
racked
between
her
jealousy
and
her
fears
even
margarita
delayed
not
to
unite
and
felipe
too
sang
feebly
and
the
volume
of
the
song
went
up
as
rounded
and
melodious
as
if
all
hearts
were
at
peace
and
in
harmony
instead
of
being
all
full
of
sorrow
confusion
or
hatred
but
there
was
no
one
of
them
all
who
was
not
the
better
for
the
singing
ramona
and
alessandro
most
of
all
the
saints
be
praised
said
alessandro
there
is
my
voice
she
can
sing
and
alessandro
was
near
he
watched
all
night
i
am
glad
he
loves
me
said
ramona
to
hear
those
two
said
the
senora
would
one
suppose
they
could
sing
like
that
perhaps
it
is
not
so
bad
as
i
as
soon
as
the
song
was
done
alessandro
ran
to
the
sheepfold
where
felipe
had
said
he
would
see
him
the
minutes
would
be
like
years
to
alessandro
till
he
had
seen
felipe
ramona
when
she
waked
and
found
herself
carefully
covered
and
bread
and
milk
standing
on
the
table
felt
much
reassured
only
the
own
hand
had
done
this
she
felt
sure
for
she
had
heard
her
the
previous
evening
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
then
violently
take
it
out
and
ramona
knew
well
that
the
fact
of
her
being
thus
a
prisoner
would
be
known
to
none
but
the
senora
herself
the
senora
would
not
set
servants
to
gossiping
she
ate
her
bread
and
milk
thankfully
for
she
was
very
hungry
then
she
set
her
room
in
order
said
her
prayers
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
what
she
could
not
imagine
in
truth
she
did
not
much
try
ramona
had
passed
now
into
a
country
where
the
senora
did
not
rule
she
felt
little
fear
felipe
would
not
see
her
harmed
and
she
was
going
away
presently
with
alessandro
it
was
wonderful
what
peace
and
freedom
lay
in
the
very
thought
the
radiance
on
her
face
of
these
two
emotions
was
the
first
thing
the
senora
observed
as
she
opened
the
door
and
slowly
very
slowly
eyeing
ramona
with
a
steady
look
entered
the
room
this
joyous
composure
on
ramona
face
angered
the
senora
as
it
had
done
before
when
she
was
dragging
her
up
the
it
seemed
to
her
like
nothing
less
than
brazen
effrontery
and
it
changed
the
whole
tone
and
manner
of
her
address
seating
herself
opposite
ramona
but
at
the
farthest
side
of
the
room
she
said
in
a
tone
scornful
and
insulting
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
returning
the
senora
gaze
with
one
no
less
steady
ramona
spoke
in
the
same
calm
tone
in
which
she
had
twice
the
evening
before
attempted
to
stay
the
senora
wrath
this
time
she
was
not
interrupted
senora
she
said
slowly
i
tried
to
tell
you
last
night
but
you
would
not
hear
me
if
you
had
listened
you
would
not
have
been
so
angry
neither
alessandro
nor
i
have
done
anything
wrong
and
we
were
not
ashamed
we
love
each
other
and
we
are
going
to
be
married
and
go
away
i
thank
you
senora
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
i
am
sure
you
will
be
a
great
deal
happier
when
i
am
away
and
ramona
looked
wistfully
with
no
shade
of
resentment
into
the
senora
dark
shrunken
face
you
have
been
very
good
to
do
so
much
for
a
girl
you
did
not
love
thank
you
for
the
bread
and
milk
last
night
perhaps
i
can
go
away
with
alessandro
i
do
not
know
what
he
will
wish
we
had
only
just
that
minute
spoken
of
being
married
when
you
found
us
last
the
senora
face
was
a
study
during
the
few
moments
that
it
took
to
say
these
words
she
was
dumb
with
amazement
instantaneously
on
the
first
sense
of
relief
that
the
disgrace
had
not
been
what
she
supposed
followed
a
new
wrath
if
possible
hotter
than
the
first
not
so
much
scorn
but
a
bitterer
anger
marry
marry
that
indian
she
cried
as
soon
as
she
found
voice
you
marry
an
indian
never
are
you
mad
i
will
never
permit
ramona
looked
anxiously
at
her
i
have
never
disobeyed
you
senora
she
said
but
this
is
different
from
all
other
things
you
are
not
my
mother
i
have
promised
to
marry
the
girl
gentleness
deceived
the
senora
no
she
said
icily
i
am
not
your
mother
but
i
stand
in
a
place
to
you
you
were
my
sister
adopted
child
and
she
gave
you
to
me
you
can
not
marry
without
my
permission
and
i
forbid
you
ever
to
speak
again
of
marrying
this
the
moment
had
come
for
the
senora
moreno
to
find
out
to
her
surprise
and
cost
of
what
stuff
this
girl
was
made
this
girl
who
had
for
fourteen
years
lived
by
her
side
docile
gentle
sunny
and
uncomplaining
in
her
loneliness
springing
to
her
feet
and
walking
swiftly
till
she
stood
close
face
to
face
with
the
senora
who
herself
startled
by
the
girl
swift
motion
had
also
risen
to
her
feet
ramona
said
in
a
louder
firmer
voice
senora
moreno
you
may
forbid
me
as
much
as
you
please
the
whole
world
can
not
keep
me
from
marrying
alessandro
i
love
him
i
have
promised
and
i
shall
keep
my
and
with
her
young
lithe
arms
straight
down
at
her
sides
her
head
thrown
back
ramona
flashed
full
in
the
senora
face
a
look
of
proud
defiance
it
was
the
first
free
moment
her
soul
had
ever
known
she
felt
herself
buoyed
up
as
by
wings
in
air
her
old
terror
of
the
senora
fell
from
her
like
a
garment
thrown
off
pshaw
said
the
senora
contemptuously
half
amused
in
spite
of
her
wrath
by
the
girl
as
she
thought
bootless
vehemence
you
talk
like
a
fool
do
you
not
know
that
i
can
shut
you
up
in
the
nunnery
if
i
choose
no
you
can
not
replied
ramona
who
then
is
to
hinder
said
the
senora
insolently
alessandro
answered
ramona
proudly
alessandro
the
senora
sneered
alessandro
ha
a
beggarly
indian
on
whom
my
servants
will
set
the
dogs
if
i
bid
them
ha
ha
the
senora
sneering
tone
but
roused
ramona
more
you
would
never
dare
she
cried
felipe
would
not
permit
it
a
most
unwise
retort
for
ramona
felipe
cried
the
senora
in
a
shrill
voice
how
dare
you
pronounce
his
name
he
will
none
of
you
from
this
hour
i
forbid
him
to
speak
to
you
indeed
he
will
never
desire
to
set
eyes
on
you
when
he
hears
the
you
are
mistaken
senora
answered
ramona
more
gently
felipe
is
alessandro
friend
and
mine
she
added
after
a
second
pause
so
ho
the
senorita
thinks
she
is
in
the
house
of
moreno
cried
the
senora
we
will
see
we
will
see
follow
me
senorita
ramona
and
throwing
open
the
door
the
senora
strode
out
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
follow
me
she
cried
again
sharply
seeing
that
ramona
hesitated
and
ramona
went
across
the
leading
to
the
out
into
the
veranda
down
the
entire
length
of
it
to
the
senora
room
the
senora
walking
with
a
quick
agitated
step
strangely
unlike
her
usual
gait
ramona
walking
far
slower
than
was
her
habit
and
with
her
eyes
bent
on
the
ground
as
they
passed
the
door
margarita
standing
just
inside
shot
at
ramona
a
vengeful
malignant
glance
she
would
help
the
senora
against
me
in
anything
thought
ramona
and
she
felt
a
thrill
of
fear
such
as
the
senora
with
all
her
threats
had
not
stirred
the
senora
windows
were
open
she
closed
them
both
and
drew
the
curtains
tight
then
she
locked
the
door
ramona
watching
her
every
movement
sit
down
in
that
chair
said
the
senora
pointing
to
one
near
the
fireplace
a
sudden
nervous
terror
seized
ramona
i
would
rather
stand
senora
she
said
do
as
i
bid
said
the
senora
in
a
husky
tone
and
ramona
obeyed
it
was
a
low
broad
armchair
and
as
she
sank
back
into
it
her
senses
seemed
leaving
her
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
back
and
closed
her
eyes
the
room
swam
she
was
roused
by
the
senora
strong
held
for
her
to
breathe
and
a
mocking
taunt
from
the
senora
iciest
voice
the
senorita
does
not
seem
so
as
she
did
a
few
moments
back
ramona
tried
to
reason
with
herself
surely
no
ill
could
happen
to
her
in
this
room
within
call
of
the
whole
house
but
an
inexplicable
terror
had
got
possession
of
her
and
when
the
senora
with
a
sneer
on
her
face
took
hold
of
the
saint
catharine
statue
and
wheeling
it
half
around
brought
into
view
a
door
in
the
wall
with
a
big
iron
key
in
the
keyhole
which
she
proceeded
to
turn
ramona
shook
with
fright
she
had
read
of
persons
who
had
been
shut
up
alive
in
cells
in
the
wall
and
starved
to
death
with
dilating
eyes
she
watched
the
senora
who
all
unaware
of
her
terror
was
prolonging
it
and
intensifying
it
by
her
every
act
first
she
took
out
the
small
iron
box
and
set
it
on
a
table
then
kneeling
she
drew
out
from
an
inner
recess
in
the
closet
a
large
box
and
pulled
it
grating
and
scraping
along
the
floor
till
it
stood
in
front
of
ramona
all
this
time
she
spoke
no
word
and
the
cruel
expression
of
her
countenance
deepened
each
moment
the
fiends
had
possession
of
the
senora
moreno
this
morning
and
no
mistake
a
braver
heart
than
ramona
might
have
indeed
been
fearful
at
being
locked
up
alone
with
a
woman
who
looked
like
that
finally
she
locked
the
door
and
wheeled
the
statue
back
into
its
place
ramona
breathed
freer
she
was
not
after
all
to
be
thrust
into
the
wall
closet
and
left
to
starve
she
gazed
with
wonder
at
the
old
battered
boxes
what
could
it
all
mean
senorita
ramona
ortegna
began
the
senora
drawing
up
a
chair
and
seating
herself
by
the
table
on
which
stood
the
iron
box
i
will
now
explain
to
you
why
you
will
not
marry
the
indian
at
these
words
this
name
ramona
was
herself
again
not
her
old
self
her
new
self
alessandro
promised
wife
the
very
sound
of
his
name
even
on
an
enemy
tongue
gave
her
strength
the
terrors
fled
away
she
looked
up
first
at
the
senora
then
at
the
nearest
window
she
was
young
and
strong
at
one
bound
if
worst
came
to
worst
she
could
leap
through
the
window
and
fly
for
her
life
calling
on
alessandro
i
shall
marry
the
indian
alessandro
senora
moreno
she
said
in
a
tone
as
defiant
and
now
almost
as
insolent
as
the
senora
own
the
senora
paid
no
heed
to
the
words
except
to
say
do
not
interrupt
me
again
i
have
much
to
tell
you
and
opening
the
box
she
lifted
out
and
placed
on
the
table
tray
after
tray
of
jewels
the
sheet
of
written
paper
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
do
you
see
this
paper
senorita
ramona
she
asked
holding
it
up
ramona
bowed
her
head
this
was
written
by
my
sister
the
senora
ortegna
who
adopted
you
and
gave
you
her
name
these
were
her
final
instructions
to
me
in
regard
to
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
property
she
left
to
ramona
lips
parted
she
leaned
forward
breathless
listening
while
the
senora
read
sentence
after
sentence
all
the
pain
wonder
fear
of
her
childhood
and
her
girlhood
as
to
the
mystery
of
her
birth
swept
over
her
anew
now
like
one
hearkening
for
life
or
death
she
listened
she
forgot
alessandro
she
did
not
look
at
the
jewels
her
eyes
never
left
the
senora
face
at
the
close
of
the
reading
the
senora
said
sternly
you
see
now
that
my
sister
left
to
me
the
entire
disposition
of
everything
belonging
to
but
it
has
said
who
was
my
mother
cried
ramona
is
that
all
there
is
in
the
paper
the
senora
looked
stupefied
was
the
girl
feigning
did
she
care
nothing
that
all
these
jewels
almost
a
little
fortune
were
to
be
lost
to
her
forever
who
was
your
mother
she
exclaimed
scornfully
there
was
no
need
to
write
that
down
your
mother
was
an
indian
everybody
knew
that
at
the
word
indian
ramona
gave
a
low
cry
the
senora
misunderstood
it
ay
she
said
a
low
common
indian
i
told
my
sister
when
she
took
you
the
indian
blood
in
your
veins
would
show
some
day
and
now
it
has
come
ramona
cheeks
were
scarlet
her
eyes
flashed
yes
senora
moreno
she
said
springing
to
her
feet
the
indian
blood
in
my
veins
shows
i
understand
many
things
i
never
understood
before
was
it
because
i
was
an
indian
that
you
have
always
hated
me
you
are
not
an
indian
and
i
have
never
hated
you
interrupted
the
senora
ramona
heeded
her
not
but
went
on
more
and
more
impetuously
and
if
i
am
an
indian
why
do
you
object
to
my
marrying
alessandro
oh
i
am
glad
i
am
an
indian
i
am
of
his
people
he
will
be
glad
the
words
poured
like
a
torrent
out
of
her
lips
in
her
excitement
she
came
closer
and
closer
to
the
senora
you
are
a
cruel
woman
she
said
i
did
not
know
it
before
but
now
i
do
if
you
knew
i
was
an
indian
you
had
no
reason
to
treat
me
so
shamefully
as
you
did
last
night
when
you
saw
me
with
alessandro
you
have
always
hated
me
is
my
mother
alive
where
does
she
live
tell
me
and
i
will
go
to
her
tell
me
she
will
be
glad
that
alessandro
loves
me
it
was
a
cruel
look
indeed
and
a
crueller
tone
with
which
the
senora
answered
i
have
not
the
least
idea
who
your
mother
was
or
if
she
is
still
alive
nobody
ever
knew
anything
about
her
some
low
vicious
creature
that
your
father
married
when
he
was
out
of
his
senses
as
you
are
now
when
you
talk
of
marrying
alessandro
he
married
her
then
asked
ramona
with
emphasis
how
know
you
that
senora
moreno
he
told
my
sister
so
replied
the
senora
reluctantly
she
grudged
the
girl
even
this
much
of
consolation
what
was
his
name
asked
ramona
phail
angus
phail
the
senora
replied
almost
mechanically
she
found
herself
strangely
constrained
by
ramona
imperious
earnestness
and
she
chafed
under
it
the
tables
were
being
turned
on
her
she
hardly
knew
how
ramona
seemed
to
tower
in
stature
and
to
have
the
bearing
of
the
one
in
authority
as
she
stood
before
her
pouring
out
passionate
question
after
question
the
senora
turned
to
the
larger
box
and
opened
it
with
unsteady
hands
she
lifted
out
the
garments
which
for
so
many
years
had
rarely
seen
the
light
shawls
and
ribosos
of
damask
laces
gowns
of
satin
of
velvet
as
the
senora
flung
one
after
another
on
the
chairs
it
was
a
glittering
pile
of
shining
costly
stuffs
eyes
rested
on
them
dreamily
did
my
adopted
mother
wear
all
these
she
asked
lifting
in
her
hand
a
fold
of
lace
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
in
evident
admiration
again
the
senora
misconceived
her
the
girl
seemed
not
insensible
to
the
value
and
beauty
of
this
costly
raiment
perhaps
she
would
be
lured
by
it
all
these
are
yours
ramona
you
understand
on
your
wedding
day
if
you
marry
worthily
with
my
permission
said
the
senora
in
a
voice
a
shade
less
cold
than
had
hitherto
come
from
her
lips
did
you
understand
what
i
read
you
the
girl
did
not
answer
she
had
taken
up
in
her
hand
a
ragged
crimson
silk
handkerchief
which
tied
in
many
knots
lay
in
one
corner
of
the
there
are
pearls
in
that
said
the
senora
that
came
with
the
things
your
father
sent
to
my
sister
when
he
ramona
eyes
gleamed
she
began
untying
the
knots
the
handkerchief
was
old
the
knots
tied
tight
and
undisturbed
for
years
as
she
reached
the
last
knot
and
felt
the
hard
stones
she
paused
this
was
my
father
she
said
yes
said
the
senora
scornfully
she
thought
she
had
detected
a
new
baseness
in
the
girl
she
was
going
to
set
up
a
claim
to
all
which
had
been
her
father
property
they
were
your
father
and
all
these
rubies
and
these
yellow
diamonds
and
she
pushed
the
tray
towards
her
ramona
had
untied
the
last
knot
holding
the
handkerchief
carefully
above
the
tray
she
shook
the
pearls
out
a
strange
spicy
fragrance
came
from
the
silk
the
pearls
fell
in
among
the
rubies
rolling
right
and
left
making
the
rubies
look
still
redder
by
contrast
with
their
snowy
whiteness
i
will
keep
this
handkerchief
she
said
thrusting
it
as
she
spoke
by
a
swift
resolute
movement
into
her
bosom
i
am
very
glad
to
have
one
thing
that
belonged
to
my
father
the
jewels
senora
you
can
give
to
the
church
if
father
salvierderra
thinks
that
is
right
i
shall
marry
alessandro
and
still
keeping
one
hand
in
her
bosom
where
she
had
thrust
the
handkerchief
she
walked
away
and
seated
herself
again
in
her
chair
father
salvierderra
the
name
smote
the
senora
like
a
there
could
be
no
stronger
evidence
of
the
abnormal
excitement
under
which
she
had
been
laboring
for
the
last
hours
than
the
fact
that
she
had
not
once
during
all
this
time
thought
to
ask
herself
what
father
salvierderra
would
say
or
might
command
in
this
crisis
her
religion
and
the
long
habit
of
its
outward
bonds
had
alike
gone
from
her
in
her
sudden
wrath
against
ramona
it
was
with
a
real
terror
that
she
became
conscious
of
this
father
salvierderra
she
stammered
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
but
ramona
saw
the
change
in
the
senora
face
at
the
word
and
followed
up
her
advantage
father
salvierderra
has
to
do
with
everything
she
said
boldly
he
knows
alessandro
he
will
not
forbid
me
to
marry
him
and
if
he
did
ramona
stopped
she
also
was
smitten
with
a
sudden
terror
at
the
vista
opening
before
her
of
a
disobedience
to
father
salvierderra
and
if
he
did
repeated
the
senora
eyeing
ramona
keenly
would
you
disobey
him
yes
said
ramona
i
will
tell
father
salvierderra
what
you
say
retorted
the
senora
sarcastically
that
he
may
spare
himself
the
humiliation
of
laying
any
commands
on
you
to
be
thus
ramona
lip
quivered
and
her
eyes
filled
with
the
tears
which
no
other
of
the
senora
taunts
had
been
strong
enough
to
bring
dearly
she
loved
the
old
monk
had
loved
him
since
her
earliest
recollection
his
displeasure
would
be
far
more
dreadful
to
her
than
the
senora
his
would
give
her
grief
the
senora
at
utmost
only
terror
clasping
her
hands
she
said
oh
senora
have
mercy
do
not
say
that
to
the
father
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
the
father
everything
that
happens
in
my
family
answered
the
senora
chillingly
he
will
agree
with
me
that
if
you
persist
in
this
disobedience
you
will
deserve
the
severest
punishment
i
shall
tell
him
all
and
she
began
putting
the
trays
back
in
the
box
you
will
not
tell
him
as
it
really
is
senora
persisted
ramona
i
will
tell
him
you
shall
not
see
him
i
will
take
care
of
that
cried
the
senora
so
vindictively
that
ramona
shuddered
i
will
give
you
one
more
chance
said
the
senora
pausing
in
the
act
of
folding
up
one
of
the
damask
gowns
will
you
obey
me
will
you
promise
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
this
indian
never
senora
replied
ramona
never
then
the
consequences
be
on
your
own
head
cried
the
senora
go
to
your
room
and
hark
i
forbid
you
to
speak
of
all
this
to
senor
felipe
do
you
hear
ramona
bowed
her
head
i
hear
she
said
and
gliding
out
of
the
room
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
instead
of
going
to
her
room
sped
like
a
hunted
creature
down
the
veranda
steps
across
the
garden
calling
in
a
low
tone
felipe
felipe
where
are
you
felipe
xii
the
little
sheepfold
or
corral
was
beyond
the
on
that
southern
slope
whose
sunshine
had
proved
so
disastrous
a
temptation
to
margarita
in
the
matter
of
drying
the
it
was
almost
like
a
terrace
this
long
slope
and
the
sheepfold
being
near
the
bottom
was
wholly
out
of
sight
of
the
house
this
was
the
reason
felipe
had
selected
it
as
the
safest
spot
for
his
talk
with
alessandro
when
ramona
reached
the
end
of
the
trellised
walk
in
the
garden
she
halted
and
looked
to
the
right
and
left
no
one
was
in
sight
as
she
entered
the
senora
room
an
hour
before
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
one
she
felt
almost
positive
it
was
felipe
turning
off
in
the
path
to
the
left
leading
down
to
the
sheepfold
she
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
gazing
earnestly
down
this
path
if
the
saints
would
only
tell
me
where
he
is
she
said
aloud
she
trembled
as
she
stood
there
fearing
each
second
to
hear
the
senora
voice
calling
her
but
fortune
was
favoring
ramona
for
once
even
as
the
words
passed
her
lips
she
saw
felipe
coming
slowly
up
the
bank
she
flew
to
meet
him
oh
felipe
felipe
she
began
yes
dear
i
know
it
all
interrupted
felipe
alessandro
has
told
she
forbade
me
to
speak
to
you
felipe
said
ramona
but
i
could
not
bear
it
what
are
we
to
do
where
is
alessandro
my
mother
forbade
you
to
speak
to
me
cried
felipe
in
a
tone
of
terror
oh
ramona
why
did
you
disobey
her
if
she
sees
us
talking
she
will
be
even
more
displeased
fly
back
to
your
room
leave
it
all
to
me
i
will
do
all
that
i
but
felipe
began
ramona
wringing
her
hands
in
distress
i
know
i
know
said
felipe
but
you
must
not
make
my
mother
any
more
angry
i
do
know
what
she
will
do
till
i
talk
with
her
do
go
back
to
your
room
did
she
not
tell
you
to
stay
there
yes
sobbed
ramona
but
i
can
not
oh
felipe
i
am
so
afraid
do
help
us
do
you
think
you
can
you
wo
let
her
shut
me
up
in
the
convent
will
you
felipe
where
is
alessandro
why
ca
i
go
away
with
him
this
minute
where
is
he
dear
felipe
let
me
go
felipe
face
was
shut
you
in
the
convent
he
gasped
did
she
say
that
ramona
dear
fly
back
to
your
room
let
me
talk
to
her
fly
i
implore
you
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
if
she
sees
me
talking
with
you
now
and
he
turned
away
and
walked
swiftly
down
the
terrace
ramona
felt
as
if
she
were
indeed
alone
in
the
world
how
could
she
go
back
into
that
house
slowly
she
walked
up
the
again
meditating
a
hundred
wild
plans
of
escape
where
where
was
alessandro
why
did
he
not
appear
for
her
rescue
her
heart
failed
her
and
when
she
entered
her
room
she
sank
on
the
floor
in
a
paroxysm
of
hopeless
weeping
if
she
had
known
that
alessandro
was
already
a
good
journey
on
his
way
to
temecula
galloping
farther
and
farther
away
from
her
each
moment
she
would
have
despaired
indeed
this
was
what
felipe
after
hearing
the
whole
story
had
counselled
him
to
do
alessandro
had
given
him
so
vivid
a
description
of
the
face
and
tone
when
she
had
ordered
him
out
of
her
sight
that
felipe
was
alarmed
he
had
never
seen
his
mother
angry
like
that
he
could
not
conceive
why
her
wrath
should
have
been
so
severe
the
longer
he
talked
with
alessandro
the
more
he
felt
that
it
would
be
wiser
for
him
to
be
out
of
sight
till
the
first
force
of
her
anger
had
been
spent
i
will
say
that
i
sent
you
said
felipe
so
she
can
not
feel
that
you
have
committed
any
offence
in
going
come
back
in
four
days
and
by
that
time
it
will
be
all
settled
what
you
shall
it
went
hard
with
alessandro
to
go
without
seeing
ramona
but
it
did
not
need
felipe
exclamation
of
surprise
to
convince
him
that
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
attempt
it
his
own
judgment
had
told
him
that
it
would
be
out
of
the
question
but
you
will
tell
her
all
senor
felipe
you
will
tell
her
that
it
is
for
her
sake
i
go
the
poor
fellow
said
piteously
gazing
into
eyes
as
if
he
would
read
his
inmost
soul
i
will
indeed
alessandro
i
will
replied
felipe
and
he
held
his
hand
out
to
alessandro
as
to
a
friend
and
equal
you
may
trust
me
to
do
all
i
can
do
for
ramona
and
for
god
bless
you
senor
felipe
answered
alessandro
gravely
a
slight
trembling
of
his
voice
alone
showing
how
deeply
he
was
moved
he
a
noble
fellow
said
felipe
to
himself
as
he
watched
alessandro
leap
on
his
horse
which
had
been
tethered
near
the
corral
all
night
a
noble
fellow
there
is
a
man
among
all
my
friends
who
would
have
been
manlier
or
franker
than
he
has
been
in
this
whole
business
i
do
in
the
least
wonder
that
ramona
loves
him
he
a
noble
fellow
but
what
is
to
be
done
what
is
to
be
done
felipe
was
sorely
perplexed
no
sharp
crisis
of
disagreement
had
ever
arisen
between
him
and
his
mother
but
he
felt
that
one
was
coming
now
he
was
unaware
of
the
extent
of
his
influence
over
her
he
doubted
whether
he
could
move
her
very
far
the
threat
of
shutting
ramona
up
in
the
convent
terrified
him
more
than
he
liked
to
admit
to
himself
had
she
power
to
do
that
felipe
did
not
know
she
must
believe
that
she
had
or
she
would
not
have
made
the
threat
felipe
whole
soul
revolted
at
the
cruel
injustice
of
the
idea
as
if
it
were
a
sin
for
the
poor
girl
to
love
alessandro
he
said
i
help
her
to
run
away
with
him
if
worse
comes
to
worst
what
can
make
my
mother
feel
so
and
felipe
paced
back
and
forth
till
the
sun
was
high
and
the
sharp
glare
and
heat
reminded
him
that
he
must
seek
shelter
then
he
threw
himself
down
under
the
willows
he
dreaded
to
go
into
the
house
his
instinctive
shrinking
from
the
disagreeable
his
disposition
to
put
off
till
another
time
held
him
back
hour
by
hour
the
longer
he
thought
the
situation
over
the
less
he
knew
how
to
broach
the
subject
to
his
mother
the
more
uncertain
he
felt
whether
it
would
be
wise
for
him
to
broach
it
at
all
suddenly
he
heard
his
name
called
it
was
margarita
who
had
been
sent
to
call
him
to
dinner
good
heavens
dinner
already
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
yes
senor
replied
margarita
eyeing
him
observantly
she
had
seen
him
talking
with
alessandro
had
seen
alessandro
galloping
away
down
the
river
road
she
had
also
gathered
much
from
the
senora
look
and
ramona
as
they
passed
the
door
together
soon
after
breakfast
margarita
could
have
given
a
tolerably
connected
account
of
all
that
had
happened
within
the
last
hours
to
the
chief
actors
in
this
tragedy
which
had
so
suddenly
begun
in
the
moreno
household
not
supposed
to
know
anything
she
yet
knew
nearly
all
and
her
every
pulse
was
beating
high
with
excited
conjecture
and
wonder
as
to
what
would
come
next
dinner
was
a
silent
and
constrained
meal
ramona
absent
the
fiction
of
her
illness
still
kept
up
felipe
embarrassed
and
unlike
himself
the
senora
silent
full
of
angry
perplexity
at
her
first
glance
in
face
she
thought
to
herself
ramona
has
spoken
to
him
when
and
how
did
she
do
it
for
it
had
been
only
a
few
moments
after
ramona
had
left
her
presence
that
she
herself
had
followed
and
seeing
the
girl
in
her
own
room
had
locked
the
door
as
before
and
had
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
on
the
veranda
within
hands
reach
of
ramona
window
how
when
and
where
had
she
contrived
to
communicate
with
felipe
the
longer
the
senora
studied
over
this
the
angrier
and
more
baffled
she
felt
to
be
outwitted
was
even
worse
to
her
than
to
be
disobeyed
under
her
very
eyes
as
it
were
something
evidently
had
happened
not
only
against
her
will
but
which
she
could
not
explain
her
anger
even
rippled
out
towards
felipe
and
was
fed
by
the
recollection
of
ramona
unwise
retort
felipe
would
not
let
you
what
had
felipe
done
or
said
to
make
the
girl
so
sure
that
he
would
be
on
her
side
and
alessandro
was
it
come
to
this
that
she
the
senora
moreno
was
to
be
defied
in
her
own
house
by
children
and
servants
it
was
with
a
tone
of
severe
displeasure
that
she
said
to
felipe
as
she
rose
from
the
my
son
i
would
like
to
have
some
conversation
with
you
in
my
room
if
you
are
at
certainly
mother
said
felipe
a
load
rolling
off
his
mind
at
her
having
thus
taken
the
initiative
for
which
he
lacked
courage
and
walking
swiftly
towards
her
he
attempted
to
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
as
it
was
his
affectionate
habit
frequently
to
do
she
repulsed
him
gently
but
bethinking
herself
passed
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
leaning
on
it
heavily
as
she
walked
said
this
is
the
most
fitting
way
my
son
i
must
lean
more
and
more
heavily
on
you
each
year
now
age
is
telling
on
me
fast
do
you
not
find
me
greatly
changed
felipe
in
the
last
year
no
madre
mia
replied
felipe
indeed
i
do
not
i
see
not
that
you
have
changed
in
the
last
ten
and
he
was
honest
in
this
his
eyes
did
not
note
the
changes
so
clear
to
others
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
the
face
he
saw
was
one
no
one
else
ever
beheld
it
was
kindled
by
emotion
transfigured
by
love
whenever
it
was
turned
towards
him
the
senora
sighed
deeply
as
she
answered
that
must
be
because
you
so
love
me
felipe
i
myself
see
the
changes
even
day
by
day
troubles
tell
on
me
as
they
did
not
when
i
was
younger
even
within
the
last
hours
i
seem
to
myself
to
have
aged
frightfully
and
she
looked
keenly
at
felipe
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
where
poor
ramona
had
swooned
a
few
hours
before
felipe
remained
standing
before
her
gazing
with
a
tender
expression
upon
her
features
but
saying
nothing
i
see
that
ramona
has
told
you
all
she
continued
her
voice
hardening
as
she
spoke
what
a
fortunate
wording
of
her
sentence
no
mother
it
was
not
ramona
it
was
alessandro
who
told
me
this
morning
early
felipe
answered
hastily
hurrying
on
to
draw
the
conversation
as
far
away
from
ramona
as
possible
he
came
and
spoke
to
me
last
night
after
i
was
in
bed
but
i
told
him
to
wait
till
morning
and
then
i
would
hear
all
he
had
to
ah
said
the
senora
relieved
then
as
felipe
remained
silent
she
asked
and
what
did
he
say
he
told
me
all
that
had
all
said
the
senora
sneeringly
do
you
suppose
that
he
told
you
all
he
said
that
you
had
bidden
him
begone
out
of
your
sight
said
felipe
and
that
he
supposed
he
must
go
so
i
told
him
to
go
at
once
i
thought
you
would
prefer
not
to
see
him
ah
said
the
senora
again
startled
gratified
that
felipe
had
so
promptly
seconded
her
action
but
sorry
that
alessandro
had
gone
ah
i
did
not
know
whether
you
would
think
it
best
to
discharge
him
at
once
or
not
i
told
him
he
must
answer
to
you
i
did
not
know
but
you
might
devise
some
measures
by
which
he
could
be
retained
on
the
felipe
stared
could
he
believe
his
ears
this
did
not
sound
like
the
relentless
displeasure
he
had
expected
could
ramona
have
been
dreaming
in
his
astonishment
he
did
not
weigh
his
mother
words
carefully
he
did
not
carry
his
conjecture
far
enough
he
did
not
stop
to
make
sure
that
retaining
alessandro
on
the
estate
might
not
of
necessity
bode
any
good
to
ramona
but
with
his
usual
impetuous
ardor
sanguine
at
the
first
glimpse
of
hope
that
all
was
well
he
exclaimed
joyfully
ah
dear
mother
if
that
could
only
be
done
all
would
be
well
and
never
noting
the
expression
of
his
mother
face
nor
pausing
to
take
breath
he
poured
out
all
he
thought
and
felt
on
the
subject
that
is
just
what
i
have
been
hoping
for
ever
since
i
saw
that
he
and
ramona
were
growing
so
fond
of
each
other
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
the
best
hand
we
have
ever
had
on
the
place
all
the
men
like
him
he
would
make
a
capital
overseer
and
if
we
put
him
in
charge
of
the
whole
estate
there
would
not
be
any
objection
to
his
marrying
ramona
that
would
give
them
a
good
living
here
with
enough
cried
the
senora
in
a
voice
which
fell
on
felipe
ears
like
a
voice
from
some
other
world
so
hollow
so
strange
he
stopped
speaking
and
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
amazement
at
the
first
words
he
had
uttered
the
senora
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
floor
a
habit
of
hers
when
she
wished
to
listen
with
close
attention
lifting
her
eyes
now
fixing
them
full
on
felipe
she
regarded
him
with
a
look
which
not
all
his
filial
reverence
could
bear
without
resentment
it
was
nearly
as
scornful
as
that
with
which
she
had
regarded
ramona
felipe
colored
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
mother
he
exclaimed
what
have
i
done
the
senora
waved
her
hand
imperiously
enough
she
reiterated
do
not
say
any
more
i
wish
to
think
for
a
few
moments
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
floor
again
felipe
studied
her
countenance
a
more
nearly
rebellious
feeling
than
he
had
supposed
himself
capable
of
slowly
arose
in
his
heart
now
he
for
the
first
time
perceived
what
terror
his
mother
must
inspire
in
a
girl
like
ramona
poor
little
one
he
thought
if
my
mother
looked
at
her
as
she
did
at
me
just
now
i
wonder
she
did
not
a
great
storm
was
going
on
in
the
senora
bosom
wrath
against
ramona
was
uppermost
in
it
in
addition
to
all
else
the
girl
had
now
been
the
cause
or
at
least
the
occasion
of
felipe
having
for
the
first
time
in
his
whole
life
angered
her
beyond
her
control
as
if
i
had
not
suffered
enough
by
reason
of
that
creature
she
thought
bitterly
to
herself
without
her
coming
between
me
and
felipe
but
nothing
could
long
come
between
the
senora
and
felipe
like
a
fresh
flowing
down
close
on
the
track
of
its
predecessor
came
the
rush
of
the
mother
passionate
love
for
her
son
close
on
the
passionate
anger
at
his
words
when
she
lifted
her
eyes
they
were
full
of
tears
which
it
smote
felipe
to
see
as
she
gazed
at
him
they
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
she
said
in
trembling
tones
forgive
me
my
child
i
had
not
thought
anything
could
make
me
thus
angry
with
you
that
shameless
creature
is
costing
us
too
dear
she
must
leave
the
felipe
heart
gave
a
bound
ramona
had
not
been
mistaken
then
a
bitter
shame
seized
him
at
his
mother
cruelty
but
her
tears
made
him
tender
and
it
was
in
a
gentle
even
pleading
voice
that
he
replied
i
do
not
see
mother
why
you
call
ramona
shameless
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
her
loving
i
found
her
in
his
arms
exclaimed
the
senora
i
know
said
felipe
alessandro
told
me
that
he
had
just
at
that
instant
told
her
he
loved
her
and
she
had
said
she
loved
him
and
would
marry
him
just
as
you
came
humph
retorted
the
senora
do
you
think
that
indian
would
have
dared
to
speak
a
word
of
love
to
the
senorita
ramona
ortegna
if
she
had
not
conducted
herself
shamelessly
i
wonder
that
he
concerned
himself
to
speak
about
marriage
to
her
at
oh
mother
mother
was
all
that
felipe
could
say
to
this
he
was
aghast
he
saw
now
in
a
flash
the
whole
picture
as
it
lay
in
his
mother
mind
and
his
heart
sank
within
him
mother
he
repeated
in
a
tone
which
spoke
volumes
ay
she
continued
that
is
what
i
say
i
see
no
reason
why
he
hesitated
to
take
her
as
he
would
take
any
indian
squaw
with
small
ceremony
of
alessandro
would
not
take
any
woman
that
way
any
quicker
than
i
would
mother
said
felipe
courageously
you
do
him
he
longed
to
add
and
ramona
too
but
he
feared
to
make
bad
matters
worse
by
pleading
for
her
at
present
no
i
do
not
said
the
senora
i
do
alessandro
full
justice
i
think
very
few
men
would
have
behaved
as
well
as
he
has
under
the
same
temptation
i
do
not
hold
him
in
the
least
responsible
for
all
that
has
happened
it
is
all
ramona
felipe
patience
gave
way
he
had
not
known
till
now
how
very
closely
this
pure
and
gentle
girl
whom
he
had
loved
as
a
sister
in
his
boyhood
and
had
come
near
loving
as
a
lover
in
his
manhood
had
twined
herself
around
his
heart
he
could
not
remain
silent
another
moment
and
hear
her
thus
wickedly
accused
mother
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
which
made
the
senora
look
up
at
him
in
sudden
astonishment
mother
i
can
not
help
it
if
i
make
you
very
angry
i
must
speak
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
say
such
things
of
ramona
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
that
alessandro
loved
the
very
ground
under
her
feet
and
ramona
would
not
have
been
a
woman
if
she
had
not
seen
it
too
she
has
seen
it
and
has
felt
it
and
has
come
to
love
him
with
all
her
soul
just
as
i
hope
some
woman
will
love
me
one
of
these
days
if
i
am
ever
loved
as
well
as
she
loves
alessandro
i
shall
be
lucky
i
think
they
ought
to
be
married
and
i
think
we
ought
to
take
alessandro
on
to
the
estate
so
that
they
can
live
here
i
do
see
anything
disgraceful
in
it
nor
anything
wrong
nor
anything
but
what
was
perfectly
natural
you
know
mother
it
is
as
if
ramona
really
belonged
to
our
family
you
know
she
is
half
a
scornful
ejaculation
from
his
mother
interrupted
him
here
but
felipe
hurried
on
partly
because
he
was
borne
out
of
himself
at
last
by
impetuous
feeling
partly
that
he
dreaded
to
stop
because
if
he
did
his
mother
would
speak
and
already
he
felt
a
terror
of
what
her
next
words
might
be
i
have
often
thought
about
ramona
future
mother
you
know
a
great
many
men
would
not
want
to
marry
her
just
because
she
is
half
indian
you
yourself
would
never
have
given
your
consent
to
my
marrying
her
if
i
had
wanted
again
an
exclamation
from
the
senora
this
time
more
of
horror
than
of
scorn
but
felipe
pressed
on
no
of
course
you
would
not
i
always
knew
that
except
for
that
i
might
have
loved
her
myself
for
a
sweeter
girl
never
drew
breath
in
this
god
felipe
was
reckless
now
having
entered
on
this
war
he
would
wage
it
with
every
weapon
that
lay
within
his
reach
if
one
did
not
tell
another
might
you
have
never
loved
her
i
do
know
that
you
have
ever
even
liked
her
i
do
think
you
have
i
know
as
a
little
boy
i
always
used
to
see
how
much
kinder
you
were
to
me
than
to
her
and
i
never
could
understand
it
and
you
are
unjust
to
her
now
i
been
watching
her
all
summer
i
seen
her
and
alessandro
together
continually
you
know
yourself
mother
he
has
been
with
us
on
the
veranda
day
after
day
just
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
family
i
watched
them
by
the
hour
when
i
lay
there
so
sick
i
thought
you
must
have
seen
it
too
i
do
believe
alessandro
has
ever
looked
or
said
or
done
a
thing
i
would
have
done
in
his
place
and
i
do
believe
ramona
has
ever
looked
said
or
done
a
thing
i
would
not
be
willing
to
have
my
own
sister
do
here
felipe
paused
he
had
made
his
charge
like
a
young
impetuous
general
massing
all
his
forces
at
the
onset
he
had
no
reserves
it
is
not
the
way
to
take
gibraltars
when
he
paused
literally
breathless
he
had
spoken
so
fast
and
even
yet
felipe
was
not
quite
strong
so
sadly
had
the
fever
undermined
his
constitution
the
senora
looked
at
him
interrogatively
and
said
in
a
now
composed
tone
you
do
not
believe
that
ramona
has
done
anything
that
you
would
not
be
willing
to
have
your
own
sister
do
would
you
be
willing
that
your
own
sister
should
marry
alessandro
clever
senora
moreno
during
the
few
moments
that
felipe
had
been
speaking
she
had
perceived
certain
things
which
it
would
be
beyond
her
power
to
do
certain
others
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
try
to
do
nothing
could
possibly
compensate
her
for
antagonizing
felipe
nothing
could
so
deeply
wound
her
as
to
have
him
in
a
resentful
mood
towards
her
or
so
weaken
her
real
control
of
him
as
to
have
him
feel
that
she
arbitrarily
overruled
his
preference
or
his
purpose
in
presence
of
her
imperious
will
even
her
wrath
capitulated
and
surrendered
there
would
be
no
hot
words
between
her
and
her
son
he
should
believe
that
he
determined
the
policy
of
the
moreno
house
even
in
this
desperate
crisis
felipe
did
not
answer
a
better
thrust
was
never
seen
on
any
field
than
the
senora
question
she
repeated
it
still
more
deliberately
in
her
wonted
gentle
voice
the
senora
was
herself
again
as
she
had
not
been
for
a
moment
since
she
came
upon
alessandro
and
ramona
at
the
brook
how
just
and
reasonable
the
question
sounded
as
she
repeated
it
slowly
with
an
expression
in
her
eyes
of
poising
and
weighing
matters
would
you
be
willing
that
your
own
sister
should
marry
alessandro
felipe
was
embarrassed
he
saw
whither
he
was
being
led
he
could
give
but
one
answer
to
this
question
no
mother
he
said
i
should
not
but
never
mind
buts
interrupted
his
mother
we
have
not
got
to
those
yet
and
she
smiled
on
felipe
an
affectionate
smile
but
it
somehow
gave
him
a
feeling
of
dread
of
course
i
knew
you
could
make
but
one
answer
to
my
question
if
you
had
a
sister
you
would
rather
see
her
dead
than
married
to
any
one
of
these
felipe
opened
his
lips
eagerly
to
speak
not
so
he
said
wait
dear
exclaimed
his
mother
one
thing
at
a
time
i
see
how
full
your
loving
heart
is
and
i
was
never
prouder
of
you
as
my
son
than
when
listening
just
now
to
your
eloquent
defence
of
ramona
perhaps
you
may
be
right
and
i
wrong
as
to
her
character
and
conduct
we
will
not
discuss
those
it
was
here
that
the
senora
had
perceived
some
things
that
it
would
be
out
of
her
power
to
do
we
will
not
discuss
those
because
they
do
not
touch
the
real
point
at
issue
what
it
is
our
duty
to
do
by
ramona
in
such
a
matter
as
this
does
not
turn
on
her
worthiness
or
unworthiness
the
question
is
is
it
right
for
you
to
allow
her
to
do
what
you
would
not
allow
your
own
sister
to
do
the
senora
paused
for
a
second
noted
with
secret
satisfaction
how
puzzled
and
unhappy
felipe
looked
then
in
a
still
gentler
voice
she
went
on
you
surely
would
not
think
that
right
my
son
would
you
and
now
the
senora
waited
for
an
answer
no
mother
came
reluctantly
from
felipe
lips
i
suppose
not
but
i
was
sure
my
own
son
could
make
no
other
reply
interrupted
the
senora
she
did
not
wish
felipe
at
present
to
do
more
than
reply
to
her
questions
of
course
it
would
not
be
right
for
us
to
let
ramona
do
anything
which
we
would
not
let
her
do
if
she
were
really
of
our
own
blood
that
is
the
way
i
have
always
looked
at
my
obligation
to
her
my
sister
intended
to
rear
her
as
her
own
daughter
she
had
given
her
her
own
name
when
my
sister
died
she
transferred
to
me
all
her
right
and
responsibility
in
and
for
the
child
you
do
not
suppose
that
if
your
aunt
had
lived
she
would
have
ever
given
her
consent
to
her
adopted
daughter
marrying
an
indian
do
you
again
the
senora
paused
for
a
reply
and
again
the
reluctant
felipe
said
in
a
low
tone
no
i
suppose
she
would
very
well
then
that
lays
a
double
obligation
on
us
it
is
not
only
that
we
are
not
to
permit
ramona
to
do
a
thing
which
we
would
consider
disgraceful
to
one
of
our
own
blood
we
are
not
to
betray
the
trust
reposed
in
us
by
the
only
person
who
had
a
right
to
control
her
and
who
transferred
that
trust
to
us
is
not
that
so
yes
mother
said
the
unhappy
felipe
he
saw
the
meshes
closing
around
him
he
felt
that
there
was
a
flaw
somewhere
in
his
mother
reasoning
but
he
could
not
point
it
out
in
fact
he
could
hardly
make
it
distinct
to
himself
his
brain
was
confused
only
one
thing
he
saw
clearly
and
that
was
that
after
all
had
been
said
and
done
ramona
would
still
marry
alessandro
but
it
was
evident
that
it
would
never
be
with
his
mother
consent
nor
with
mine
either
openly
the
way
she
puts
it
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
and
yet
i
have
promised
alessandro
to
do
all
i
could
for
him
curse
the
luck
i
wish
he
had
never
set
foot
on
the
place
said
felipe
in
his
heart
growing
unreasonable
and
tired
with
the
perplexity
the
senora
continued
i
shall
always
blame
myself
bitterly
for
having
failed
to
see
what
was
going
on
as
you
say
alessandro
has
been
with
us
a
great
deal
since
your
illness
with
his
music
and
singing
and
one
thing
and
another
but
i
can
truly
say
that
i
never
thought
of
being
in
danger
of
looking
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
possible
lover
any
more
than
of
her
looking
thus
upon
juan
canito
or
luigo
or
any
other
of
the
herdsmen
or
laborers
i
regret
it
more
than
words
can
express
and
i
do
not
know
what
we
can
do
now
that
it
has
that
it
mother
that
it
broke
in
felipe
you
see
you
see
it
is
too
late
the
senora
went
on
as
if
felipe
had
not
spoken
i
suppose
you
would
really
very
much
regret
to
part
with
alessandro
and
your
word
is
in
a
way
pledged
to
him
as
you
had
asked
him
if
he
would
stay
on
the
place
of
course
now
that
all
this
has
happened
it
would
be
very
unpleasant
for
ramona
to
stay
here
and
see
him
continually
at
least
for
a
time
until
she
gets
over
this
strange
passion
she
seems
to
have
conceived
for
him
it
will
not
last
such
sudden
passions
never
the
senora
artfully
interpolated
what
should
you
think
felipe
of
having
her
go
back
to
the
sisters
school
for
a
time
she
was
very
happy
the
senora
had
strained
a
point
too
far
felipe
suddenly
gave
way
and
as
impetuously
as
he
had
spoken
in
the
beginning
he
spoke
again
now
nerved
by
the
memory
of
ramona
face
and
tone
as
she
had
cried
to
him
in
the
garden
oh
felipe
you
wo
let
her
shut
me
up
in
the
convent
will
you
mother
he
cried
you
would
never
do
that
you
would
not
shut
the
poor
girl
up
in
the
convent
the
senora
raised
her
eyebrows
in
astonishment
who
spoke
of
shutting
up
she
said
ramona
has
already
been
there
at
school
she
might
go
again
she
is
not
too
old
to
learn
a
change
of
scene
and
occupation
is
the
best
possible
cure
for
a
girl
who
has
a
thing
of
this
sort
to
get
over
can
you
propose
anything
better
my
son
what
would
you
advise
and
a
third
time
the
senora
paused
for
an
answer
these
pauses
and
direct
questions
of
the
senora
were
like
nothing
in
life
so
much
as
like
that
stage
in
a
spider
processes
when
withdrawing
a
little
way
from
a
victim
which
still
supposes
himself
free
it
rests
from
its
weaving
and
watches
the
victim
flutter
subtle
questions
like
these
assuming
taking
for
granted
as
settled
much
which
had
never
been
settled
at
all
were
among
the
best
weapons
in
the
senora
armory
they
rarely
failed
her
advise
cried
felipe
excitedly
advise
this
is
what
i
advise
to
let
ramona
and
alessandro
marry
i
ca
help
all
you
say
about
our
obligations
i
dare
say
you
right
and
it
a
cursedly
awkward
complication
for
us
anyhow
the
way
you
put
yes
awkward
for
you
as
the
head
of
our
house
interrupted
the
senora
sighing
i
do
quite
see
how
you
would
face
well
i
do
propose
to
face
it
continued
felipe
testily
i
propose
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
from
first
to
last
let
her
go
away
with
him
if
she
wants
to
without
our
consent
said
the
senora
gently
yes
without
it
if
she
ca
go
with
it
and
i
do
see
as
you
have
stated
it
how
we
could
exactly
take
any
responsibility
about
marrying
her
to
alessandro
but
for
heaven
sake
mother
let
her
go
she
will
go
any
way
you
have
the
least
idea
how
she
loves
alessandro
or
how
he
loves
her
let
her
go
do
you
really
think
she
would
run
away
with
him
if
it
came
to
that
asked
the
senora
earnestly
run
away
and
marry
him
spite
of
our
refusing
to
consent
to
the
marriage
i
do
said
felipe
then
it
is
your
opinion
is
it
that
the
only
thing
left
for
us
to
do
is
to
wash
our
hands
of
it
altogether
and
leave
her
free
to
do
what
she
pleases
that
just
what
i
do
think
mother
replied
felipe
his
heart
growing
lighter
at
her
words
that
just
what
i
do
think
we
ca
prevent
it
and
it
is
of
no
use
to
try
do
let
us
tell
them
they
can
do
as
they
of
course
alessandro
must
leave
us
then
said
the
senora
they
could
not
stay
i
do
see
why
said
felipe
anxiously
you
will
my
son
if
you
think
a
moment
could
we
possibly
give
a
stronger
indorsement
to
their
marriage
than
by
keeping
them
here
you
see
that
would
be
so
felipe
eyes
fell
then
i
suppose
they
could
be
married
here
either
he
said
what
more
could
we
do
than
that
for
a
marriage
that
we
heartily
approved
of
my
son
true
mother
and
felipe
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
but
then
we
force
them
to
run
away
oh
said
the
senora
icily
if
they
go
they
will
go
of
their
own
accord
we
hope
they
will
never
do
anything
so
foolish
and
wrong
if
they
do
i
suppose
we
shall
always
be
held
in
a
measure
responsible
for
not
having
prevented
it
but
if
you
think
it
is
not
wise
or
of
no
use
to
attempt
that
i
do
not
see
what
there
is
to
be
felipe
did
not
speak
he
felt
discomfited
felt
as
if
he
had
betrayed
his
friend
alessandro
his
sister
ramona
as
if
a
strange
complication
network
of
circumstances
had
forced
him
into
a
false
position
he
did
not
see
what
more
he
could
ask
what
more
could
be
asked
of
his
mother
he
did
not
see
either
that
much
less
could
have
been
granted
to
alessandro
and
ramona
he
was
angry
wearied
perplexed
the
senora
studied
his
face
you
do
not
seem
satisfied
felipe
dear
she
said
tenderly
as
indeed
how
could
you
be
in
this
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
but
can
you
think
of
anything
different
for
us
to
do
no
said
felipe
bitterly
i
ca
that
the
worst
of
it
it
is
just
turning
ramona
out
of
the
house
that
felipe
felipe
exclaimed
the
senora
how
unjust
you
are
to
yourself
you
know
you
would
never
do
that
you
know
that
she
has
always
had
a
home
here
as
if
she
were
a
daughter
and
always
will
have
as
long
as
she
wishes
it
if
she
chooses
to
turn
her
back
on
it
and
go
away
is
it
our
fault
do
not
let
your
pity
for
this
misguided
girl
blind
you
to
what
is
just
to
yourself
and
to
me
turn
ramona
out
of
the
house
you
know
i
promised
my
sister
to
bring
her
up
as
my
own
child
and
i
have
always
felt
that
my
son
would
receive
the
trust
from
me
when
i
died
ramona
has
a
home
under
the
moreno
roof
so
long
as
she
will
accept
it
it
is
not
just
felipe
to
say
that
we
turn
her
out
and
tears
stood
in
the
senora
eyes
forgive
me
dear
mother
cried
the
unhappy
felipe
forgive
me
for
adding
one
burden
to
all
you
have
to
bear
truth
is
this
miserable
business
has
so
distraught
my
senses
i
ca
seem
to
see
anything
as
it
is
dear
mother
it
is
very
hard
for
you
i
wish
it
were
done
thanks
for
your
precious
sympathy
my
felipe
replied
the
senora
if
it
were
not
for
you
i
should
long
ago
have
broken
down
beneath
my
cares
and
burdens
but
among
them
all
have
been
few
so
grievous
as
this
i
feel
myself
and
our
home
dishonored
but
we
must
submit
as
you
say
felipe
i
wish
it
were
done
with
it
would
be
as
well
perhaps
to
send
for
ramona
at
once
and
tell
her
what
we
have
decided
she
is
no
doubt
in
great
anxiety
we
will
see
her
felipe
would
have
greatly
preferred
to
see
ramona
alone
but
as
he
knew
not
how
to
bring
this
about
he
assented
to
his
mother
suggestion
opening
her
door
the
senora
walked
slowly
down
the
unlocked
ramona
door
and
said
ramona
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
my
room
felipe
and
i
have
something
to
say
to
ramona
followed
the
words
felipe
and
i
boded
no
good
the
senora
has
made
felipe
think
just
as
she
does
herself
thought
ramona
oh
what
will
become
of
me
and
she
stole
a
reproachful
imploring
look
at
felipe
he
smiled
back
in
a
way
which
reassured
her
but
the
reassurance
did
not
last
long
senorita
ramona
ortegna
began
the
senora
felipe
shivered
he
had
had
no
conception
that
his
mother
could
speak
in
that
way
the
words
seemed
to
open
a
gulf
between
ramona
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
so
cold
and
distant
they
sounded
as
the
senora
might
speak
to
an
intruding
stranger
senorita
ramona
ortegna
she
said
my
son
and
i
have
been
discussing
what
it
is
best
for
us
to
do
in
the
mortifying
and
humiliating
position
in
which
you
place
us
by
your
relation
with
the
indian
alessandro
of
course
you
know
or
you
ought
to
know
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
us
to
give
our
consent
to
your
making
such
a
marriage
we
should
be
false
to
a
trust
and
dishonor
our
own
family
name
if
we
did
ramona
eyes
dilated
her
cheeks
paled
she
opened
her
lips
but
no
sound
came
from
them
she
looked
toward
felipe
and
seeing
him
with
downcast
eyes
and
an
expression
of
angry
embarrassment
on
his
face
despair
seized
her
felipe
had
deserted
their
cause
oh
where
where
was
alessandro
clasping
her
hands
she
uttered
a
low
cry
a
cry
that
cut
felipe
to
the
heart
he
was
finding
out
in
thus
being
witness
of
ramona
suffering
that
she
was
far
nearer
and
dearer
to
him
than
he
had
realized
it
would
have
taken
very
little
at
such
moments
as
these
to
have
made
felipe
her
lover
again
he
felt
now
like
springing
to
her
side
folding
his
arms
around
her
and
bidding
his
mother
defiance
it
took
all
the
he
could
gather
to
remain
silent
and
trust
to
ramona
understanding
him
later
ramona
cry
made
no
break
in
the
smooth
icy
flow
of
the
sentences
she
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
it
but
continued
my
son
tells
me
that
he
thinks
our
forbidding
it
would
make
no
difference
that
you
would
go
away
with
the
man
all
the
same
i
suppose
he
is
right
in
thinking
so
as
you
yourself
told
me
that
even
if
father
salvierderra
forbade
it
you
would
disobey
him
of
course
if
this
is
your
determination
we
are
powerless
even
if
i
were
to
put
you
in
the
keeping
of
the
church
which
is
what
i
am
sure
my
sister
who
adopted
you
as
her
child
would
do
if
she
were
alive
you
would
devise
some
means
of
escape
and
thus
bring
a
still
greater
and
more
public
scandal
on
the
family
felipe
thinks
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
attempt
to
bring
you
to
reason
in
that
way
and
we
shall
therefore
do
nothing
i
wish
to
impress
it
upon
you
that
my
son
as
head
of
this
house
and
i
as
my
sister
representative
consider
you
a
member
of
our
own
family
so
long
as
we
have
a
home
for
ourselves
that
home
is
yours
as
it
always
has
been
if
you
choose
to
leave
it
and
to
disgrace
yourself
and
us
by
marrying
an
indian
we
can
not
help
the
senora
paused
ramona
did
not
speak
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
senora
face
as
if
she
would
penetrate
to
her
inmost
soul
the
girl
was
beginning
to
recognize
the
senora
true
nature
her
instincts
and
her
perceptions
were
sharpened
by
love
have
you
anything
to
say
to
me
or
to
my
son
asked
the
senora
no
senora
replied
ramona
i
do
not
think
of
anything
more
to
say
than
i
said
this
morning
yes
she
added
there
is
perhaps
i
shall
not
speak
with
you
again
before
i
go
away
i
thank
you
once
more
for
the
home
you
have
given
me
for
so
many
years
and
you
too
felipe
she
continued
turning
towards
felipe
her
face
changing
all
her
affection
and
sorrow
looking
out
of
her
tearful
eyes
you
too
dear
felipe
you
have
always
been
so
good
to
me
i
shall
always
love
you
as
long
as
i
live
and
she
held
out
both
her
hands
to
him
felipe
took
them
in
his
and
was
about
to
speak
when
the
senora
interrupted
him
she
did
not
intend
to
have
any
more
of
this
sort
of
affectionate
familiarity
between
her
son
and
ramona
are
we
to
understand
that
you
are
taking
your
leave
now
she
said
is
it
your
purpose
to
go
at
once
i
do
not
know
senora
stammered
ramona
i
have
not
seen
alessandro
i
have
not
heard
and
she
looked
up
in
distress
at
felipe
who
answered
compassionately
alessandro
has
gone
shrieked
ramona
gone
not
gone
felipe
only
for
four
days
replied
felipe
to
temecula
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
be
away
for
a
day
or
two
he
is
to
come
back
immediately
perhaps
he
will
be
back
day
after
did
he
want
to
go
what
did
he
go
for
why
did
you
let
me
go
with
him
oh
why
why
did
he
go
cried
ramona
he
went
because
my
son
told
him
to
go
broke
in
the
senora
impatient
of
this
scene
and
of
the
sympathy
she
saw
struggling
in
expressive
features
my
son
thought
and
rightly
that
the
sight
of
him
would
be
more
than
i
could
bear
just
now
so
he
ordered
him
to
go
away
and
alessandro
like
a
wounded
creature
at
bay
ramona
turned
suddenly
away
from
felipe
and
facing
the
senora
her
eyes
resolute
and
dauntless
spite
of
the
streaming
tears
exclaimed
lifting
her
right
hand
as
she
spoke
you
have
been
cruel
god
will
punish
you
and
without
waiting
to
see
what
effect
her
words
had
produced
without
looking
again
at
felipe
she
walked
swiftly
out
of
the
room
you
see
said
the
senora
you
see
she
defies
she
is
desperate
said
felipe
i
am
sorry
i
sent
alessandro
no
my
son
replied
the
senora
you
were
wise
as
you
always
are
it
may
bring
her
to
her
senses
to
have
a
few
days
reflection
in
you
do
not
mean
to
keep
her
locked
up
mother
do
you
cried
felipe
the
senora
turned
a
look
of
apparently
undisguised
amazement
on
him
you
would
not
think
that
best
would
you
did
you
not
say
that
all
we
could
do
was
simply
not
to
interfere
with
her
in
any
way
to
wash
our
hands
so
far
as
is
possible
of
all
responsibility
about
her
yes
yes
said
the
baffled
felipe
that
was
what
i
said
but
mother
he
stopped
he
did
not
know
what
he
wanted
to
say
the
senora
looked
tenderly
at
him
her
face
full
of
anxious
inquiry
what
is
it
felipe
dear
is
there
anything
more
you
think
i
ought
to
say
or
do
she
asked
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
do
mother
said
felipe
i
do
seem
to
understand
what
you
are
going
to
nothing
felipe
you
have
entirely
convinced
me
that
all
effort
would
be
thrown
away
i
shall
do
nothing
replied
the
senora
nothing
then
as
long
as
ramona
is
here
everything
will
be
just
as
it
always
has
been
said
felipe
the
senora
smiled
sadly
dear
felipe
do
you
think
that
possible
a
girl
who
has
announced
her
determination
to
disobey
not
only
you
and
me
but
father
salvierderra
who
is
going
to
bring
disgrace
both
on
the
moreno
and
the
ortegna
name
we
ca
feel
exactly
the
same
towards
her
as
we
did
before
can
we
felipe
made
an
impatient
gesture
no
of
course
not
but
i
mean
is
everything
to
be
just
the
same
outwardly
as
it
was
before
i
supposed
so
said
the
senora
was
not
that
your
idea
we
must
try
to
have
it
so
i
think
do
not
you
yes
groaned
felipe
if
we
can
xiii
the
senora
moreno
had
never
before
been
so
discomfited
as
in
this
matter
of
ramona
and
alessandro
it
chafed
her
to
think
over
her
conversation
with
felipe
to
recall
how
far
the
thing
she
finally
attained
was
from
the
thing
she
had
in
view
when
she
began
to
have
ramona
sent
to
the
convent
alessandro
kept
as
overseer
of
the
place
and
the
ortegna
jewels
turned
into
the
treasury
of
the
church
this
was
the
plan
she
had
determined
on
in
her
own
mind
instead
of
this
alessandro
was
not
to
be
overseer
on
the
place
ramona
would
not
go
to
the
convent
she
would
be
married
to
alessandro
and
they
would
go
away
together
and
the
ortegna
jewels
well
that
was
a
thing
to
be
decided
in
the
future
that
should
be
left
to
father
salvierderra
to
decide
bold
as
the
senora
was
she
had
not
quite
the
courage
requisite
to
take
that
question
wholly
into
her
own
hands
one
thing
was
clear
felipe
must
not
be
consulted
in
regard
to
them
he
had
never
known
of
them
and
need
not
now
felipe
was
far
too
much
in
sympathy
with
ramona
to
take
a
just
view
of
the
situation
he
would
be
sure
to
have
a
quixotic
idea
of
ramona
right
of
ownership
it
was
not
impossible
that
father
salvierderra
might
have
the
same
feeling
if
so
she
must
yield
but
that
would
go
harder
with
her
than
all
the
rest
almost
the
senora
would
have
been
ready
to
keep
the
whole
thing
a
secret
from
the
father
if
he
had
not
been
at
the
time
of
the
senora
death
fully
informed
of
all
the
particulars
of
her
bequest
to
her
adopted
child
at
any
rate
it
would
be
nearly
a
year
before
the
father
came
again
and
in
the
mean
time
she
would
not
risk
writing
about
it
the
treasure
was
as
safe
in
saint
catharine
keeping
as
it
had
been
all
these
fourteen
years
it
should
still
lie
hidden
there
when
ramona
went
away
with
alessandro
she
would
write
to
father
salvierderra
simply
stating
the
facts
in
her
own
way
and
telling
him
that
all
further
questions
must
wait
for
decision
until
they
met
and
so
she
plotted
and
planned
and
mapped
out
the
future
in
her
tireless
weaving
brain
till
she
was
somewhat
soothed
for
the
partial
failure
of
her
plans
there
is
nothing
so
skilful
in
its
own
defence
as
imperious
pride
it
has
an
ingenious
system
of
its
own
of
reprisals
a
system
so
ingenious
that
the
defeat
must
be
sore
indeed
after
which
it
can
not
still
find
some
booty
to
bring
off
and
even
greater
than
this
ingenuity
at
reprisals
is
its
capacity
for
in
this
regard
it
outdoes
vanity
a
thousandfold
wounded
vanity
knows
when
it
is
mortally
hurt
and
limps
off
the
field
piteous
all
disguises
thrown
away
but
pride
carries
its
banner
to
the
last
and
fast
as
it
is
driven
from
one
field
unfurls
it
in
another
never
admitting
that
there
is
a
shade
less
honor
in
the
second
field
than
in
the
first
or
in
the
third
than
in
the
second
and
so
on
till
death
it
is
impossible
not
to
have
a
certain
sort
of
admiration
for
this
kind
of
pride
cruel
those
who
have
it
are
to
all
who
come
in
their
way
but
they
are
equally
cruel
to
themselves
when
pride
demands
the
sacrifice
such
pride
as
this
has
led
many
a
forlorn
hope
on
the
earth
when
all
other
motives
have
died
out
of
men
breasts
has
won
many
a
crown
which
has
not
been
called
by
its
true
name
before
the
afternoon
was
over
the
senora
had
her
plan
her
chart
of
the
future
as
it
were
all
reconstructed
the
sting
of
her
discomfiture
soothed
the
placid
quiet
of
her
manner
restored
her
habitual
occupations
also
and
little
ways
all
resumed
she
was
going
to
do
nothing
in
regard
to
ramona
only
she
herself
knew
how
much
that
meant
how
bitterly
much
she
wished
she
were
sure
that
felipe
also
would
do
nothing
but
her
mind
still
misgave
her
about
felipe
unpityingly
she
had
led
him
on
and
entangled
him
in
his
own
words
step
by
step
till
she
had
brought
him
to
the
position
she
wished
him
to
take
ostensibly
his
position
and
hers
were
one
their
action
a
unit
all
the
same
she
did
not
deceive
herself
as
to
his
real
feeling
about
the
affair
he
loved
ramona
he
liked
alessandro
barring
the
question
of
family
pride
which
he
had
hardly
thought
of
till
she
suggested
it
and
which
he
would
not
dwell
on
apart
from
her
continuing
to
press
it
barring
this
he
would
have
liked
to
have
alessandro
marry
ramona
and
remain
on
the
place
all
this
would
come
uppermost
in
mind
again
when
he
was
removed
from
the
pressure
of
her
influence
nevertheless
she
did
not
intend
to
speak
with
him
on
the
subject
again
or
to
permit
him
to
speak
to
her
her
ends
would
be
best
attained
by
taking
and
keeping
the
ground
that
the
question
of
their
having
been
settled
once
for
all
the
painful
topic
should
never
be
renewed
between
them
in
patient
silence
they
must
await
ramona
action
must
bear
whatever
of
disgrace
and
pain
she
chose
to
inflict
on
the
family
which
had
sheltered
her
from
her
infancy
till
now
the
details
of
the
nothing
she
proposed
to
do
slowly
arranged
themselves
in
her
mind
there
should
be
no
apparent
change
in
position
in
the
house
she
should
come
and
go
as
freely
as
ever
no
watch
on
her
movements
she
should
eat
sleep
rise
up
and
sit
down
with
them
as
before
there
should
be
not
a
word
or
act
that
sympathetic
sensitiveness
could
construe
into
any
provocation
to
ramona
to
run
away
nevertheless
ramona
should
be
made
to
feel
every
moment
of
every
hour
that
she
was
in
disgrace
that
she
was
with
them
but
not
of
them
that
she
had
chosen
an
alien
position
and
must
abide
by
it
how
this
was
to
be
done
the
senora
did
not
put
in
words
to
herself
but
she
knew
very
well
if
anything
would
bring
the
girl
to
her
senses
this
would
there
might
still
be
a
hope
the
senora
believed
so
little
did
she
know
ramona
nature
or
the
depth
of
her
affection
for
alessandro
that
she
might
be
in
this
manner
brought
to
see
the
enormity
of
the
offence
she
would
commit
if
she
persisted
in
her
purpose
and
if
she
did
perceive
this
confess
her
wrong
and
give
up
the
marriage
the
senora
grew
almost
generous
and
tolerant
in
her
thoughts
as
she
contemplated
this
contingency
if
she
did
thus
humble
herself
and
return
to
her
rightful
allegiance
to
the
moreno
house
the
senora
would
forgive
her
and
would
do
more
for
her
than
she
had
ever
hitherto
done
she
would
take
her
to
los
angeles
and
to
monterey
would
show
her
a
little
more
of
the
world
and
it
was
by
no
means
unlikely
that
there
might
thus
come
about
for
her
a
satisfactory
and
honorable
marriage
felipe
should
see
that
she
was
not
disposed
to
deal
unfairly
by
ramona
in
any
way
if
ramona
herself
would
behave
properly
ramona
surprise
when
the
senora
entered
her
room
just
before
supper
and
in
her
ordinary
tone
asked
a
question
about
the
chili
which
was
drying
on
the
veranda
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
avoid
showing
it
both
in
her
voice
and
look
the
senora
recognized
this
immediately
but
gave
no
sign
of
having
done
so
continuing
what
she
had
to
say
about
the
chili
the
hot
sun
the
turning
of
the
grapes
precisely
as
she
would
have
spoken
to
ramona
a
week
previous
at
least
this
was
what
ramona
at
first
thought
but
before
the
sentences
were
finished
she
had
detected
in
the
eye
and
tone
the
weapons
which
were
to
be
employed
against
her
the
emotion
of
wonder
with
which
she
had
heard
the
first
words
changed
quickly
to
heartsick
misery
before
they
were
concluded
and
she
said
to
herself
that
the
way
she
is
going
to
break
me
down
she
thinks
but
she
ca
do
it
i
can
bear
anything
for
four
days
and
the
minute
alessandro
comes
i
will
go
away
with
this
train
of
thought
in
ramona
mind
was
reflected
in
her
face
the
senora
saw
it
and
hardened
herself
still
more
it
was
to
be
war
then
no
hope
of
surrender
very
well
the
girl
had
made
her
choice
margarita
was
now
the
most
puzzled
person
in
the
household
she
had
overheard
snatches
of
the
conversation
between
felipe
and
his
mother
and
ramona
having
let
her
curiosity
get
so
far
the
better
of
her
discretion
as
to
creep
to
the
door
and
listen
in
fact
she
narrowly
escaped
being
caught
having
had
barely
time
to
begin
her
feint
of
sweeping
the
when
ramona
flinging
the
door
wide
open
came
out
after
her
final
reply
to
the
senora
the
words
of
which
margarita
had
distinctly
heard
god
will
punish
holy
virgin
how
dare
she
say
that
to
the
senora
ejaculated
margarita
under
her
breath
and
the
next
second
ramona
rushed
by
not
even
seeing
her
but
the
senora
vigilant
eyes
following
ramona
saw
her
and
the
senora
voice
had
a
ring
of
suspicion
in
it
as
she
called
how
comes
it
you
are
sweeping
the
at
this
hour
of
the
day
margarita
it
was
surely
the
devil
himself
that
put
into
margarita
head
the
quick
lie
which
she
instantaneously
told
there
was
early
breakfast
senora
to
be
cooked
for
alessandro
who
was
setting
off
in
haste
and
my
mother
was
not
up
so
i
had
it
to
as
margarita
said
this
felipe
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
her
she
changed
color
felipe
knew
this
was
a
lie
he
had
seen
margarita
peering
about
among
the
willows
while
he
was
talking
with
alessandro
at
the
sheepfold
he
had
seen
alessandro
halt
for
a
moment
and
speak
to
her
as
he
rode
past
only
for
a
moment
then
pricking
his
horse
sharply
he
had
galloped
off
down
the
valley
road
no
breakfast
had
alessandro
had
at
margarita
hands
or
any
other
that
morning
what
could
have
been
margarita
motive
for
telling
this
lie
but
felipe
had
too
many
serious
cares
on
his
mind
to
busy
himself
long
with
any
thought
of
margarita
or
her
fibs
she
had
said
the
first
thing
which
came
into
her
head
most
likely
to
shelter
herself
from
the
senora
displeasure
which
was
indeed
very
near
the
truth
only
there
was
added
a
spice
of
malice
against
alessandro
a
slight
undercurrent
of
jealous
antagonism
towards
him
had
begun
to
grow
up
among
the
servants
of
late
fostered
if
not
originated
by
margarita
sharp
sayings
as
to
his
being
admitted
to
such
strange
intimacy
with
the
family
while
felipe
continued
ill
and
was
so
soothed
to
rest
by
his
music
there
was
no
room
for
cavil
it
was
natural
that
alessandro
came
and
went
as
a
physician
might
but
after
felipe
had
recovered
why
should
this
freedom
and
intimacy
continue
more
than
once
there
had
been
sullen
mutterings
of
this
kind
on
the
north
veranda
when
all
the
laborers
and
servants
were
gathered
there
of
an
evening
alessandro
alone
being
absent
from
the
group
and
the
sounds
of
his
voice
or
his
violin
coming
from
the
south
veranda
where
the
family
sat
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
too
had
a
bit
of
music
now
and
then
juan
canito
would
grumble
but
the
lad
chary
enough
of
his
bow
on
this
side
the
ho
we
not
good
enough
for
him
to
play
to
margarita
would
reply
master
like
servant
is
a
good
proverb
sometimes
but
not
always
but
there
a
deal
going
on
on
the
veranda
yonder
besides
fiddling
and
margarita
lips
would
purse
themselves
up
in
an
expression
of
concentrated
mystery
and
secret
knowledge
well
fitted
to
draw
from
everybody
a
fire
of
questions
none
of
which
however
would
she
answer
she
knew
better
than
to
slander
the
senorita
ramona
or
to
say
a
word
even
reflecting
upon
her
unfavorably
not
a
man
or
a
woman
there
would
have
borne
it
they
all
had
loved
ramona
ever
since
she
came
among
them
as
a
toddling
baby
they
petted
her
then
and
idolized
her
now
not
one
of
them
whom
she
had
not
done
good
offices
for
nursed
them
cheered
them
remembered
their
birthdays
and
their
to
no
one
but
her
mother
had
margarita
unbosomed
what
she
knew
and
what
she
suspected
and
old
marda
frightened
at
the
bare
pronouncing
of
such
words
had
terrified
margarita
into
the
solemnest
of
promises
never
under
any
circumstances
whatever
to
say
such
things
to
any
other
member
of
the
family
marda
did
not
believe
them
she
could
not
she
believed
that
margarita
jealousy
had
imagined
all
and
the
senora
she
send
you
packing
off
this
place
in
an
hour
and
me
too
long
i
lived
here
if
ever
she
was
to
know
of
you
blackening
the
senorita
an
indian
too
you
must
be
mad
margarita
when
margarita
in
triumph
had
flown
to
tell
her
that
the
senora
had
just
dragged
the
senorita
ramona
up
the
and
shoved
her
into
her
room
and
locked
the
door
and
that
it
was
because
she
had
caught
her
with
alessandro
at
the
marda
first
crossed
herself
in
sheer
mechanical
fashion
at
the
shock
of
the
story
and
then
cuffed
margarita
ears
for
telling
her
i
take
the
head
off
your
neck
if
you
say
that
aloud
again
whatever
come
to
the
senora
forty
years
i
lived
under
this
roof
and
i
never
saw
her
lift
a
hand
to
a
living
creature
yet
you
out
of
your
senses
child
she
said
all
the
time
gazing
fearfully
towards
the
room
you
see
whether
i
am
out
of
my
senses
or
not
retorted
margarita
and
ran
back
to
the
and
after
the
door
was
shut
and
the
unhappy
pretence
of
a
supper
had
begun
old
marda
had
herself
crept
softly
to
the
senorita
door
and
listened
and
heard
ramona
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
then
she
knew
that
what
margarita
had
said
must
be
true
and
her
faithful
soul
was
in
sore
straits
what
to
think
the
senorita
misdemean
herself
never
whatever
happened
it
was
not
that
there
was
some
horrible
mistake
somewhere
kneeling
at
the
keyhole
she
had
called
cautiously
to
ramona
oh
my
lamb
what
is
it
but
ramona
had
not
heard
her
and
the
danger
was
too
great
of
remaining
so
scrambling
up
with
difficulty
from
her
rheumatic
knees
the
old
woman
had
hobbled
back
to
the
kitchen
as
much
in
the
dark
as
before
and
by
a
curiously
illogical
consequence
crosser
than
ever
to
her
daughter
all
the
next
day
she
watched
for
herself
and
could
not
but
see
that
all
appearances
bore
out
margarita
statements
alessandro
sudden
departure
had
been
a
tremendous
corroboration
of
the
story
not
one
of
the
men
had
had
an
inkling
of
it
juan
canito
luigo
both
alike
astonished
no
word
left
no
message
sent
only
senor
felipe
had
said
carelessly
to
juan
can
after
breakfast
you
have
to
look
after
things
yourself
for
a
few
days
juan
alessandro
has
gone
to
for
a
few
days
exclaimed
margarita
sarcastically
when
this
was
repeated
to
her
that
easy
said
if
alessandro
assis
is
seen
here
again
i
eat
my
head
he
played
his
last
tune
on
the
south
veranda
i
wager
but
when
at
of
this
same
eventful
day
the
senora
was
heard
as
she
passed
the
senorita
door
to
say
in
her
ordinary
voice
are
you
ready
for
supper
ramona
and
ramona
was
seen
to
come
out
and
walk
by
the
senora
side
to
the
silent
to
be
sure
but
then
that
was
no
strange
thing
the
senorita
always
was
more
silent
in
the
senora
presence
when
marda
standing
in
the
feigning
to
be
feeding
her
chickens
but
keeping
a
close
eye
on
the
saw
this
she
was
relieved
and
thought
it
only
a
dispute
there
has
been
there
will
be
disputes
in
families
sometimes
it
is
none
of
our
affair
all
is
settled
and
margarita
standing
in
the
when
she
saw
them
all
coming
in
as
usual
the
senora
felipe
ramona
no
change
even
to
her
scrutinizing
eye
in
anybody
face
was
more
surprised
than
she
had
been
for
many
a
day
and
began
to
think
again
as
she
had
more
than
once
since
this
tragedy
began
that
she
must
have
dreamed
much
that
she
remembered
but
surfaces
are
deceitful
and
eyes
see
little
considering
its
complexity
the
fineness
and
delicacy
of
its
mechanism
the
results
attainable
by
the
human
eye
seem
far
from
adequate
to
the
expenditure
put
upon
it
we
have
flattered
ourselves
by
inventing
proverbs
of
comparison
in
matter
of
blindness
blind
as
a
bat
for
instance
it
would
be
safe
to
say
that
there
can
not
be
found
in
the
animal
kingdom
a
bat
or
any
other
creature
so
blind
in
its
own
range
of
circumstance
and
connection
as
the
greater
majority
of
human
beings
are
in
the
bosoms
of
their
families
tempers
strain
and
recover
hearts
break
and
heal
strength
falters
fails
and
comes
near
to
giving
way
altogether
every
day
without
being
noted
by
the
closest
before
night
of
this
second
day
since
the
trouble
had
burst
like
a
on
the
peaceful
moreno
household
everything
had
so
resumed
the
ordinary
expression
and
routine
that
a
shrewder
observer
and
reasoner
than
margarita
might
well
be
excused
for
doubting
if
any
serious
disaster
could
have
occurred
to
any
one
senor
felipe
sauntered
about
in
his
usual
fashion
smoking
his
cigarettes
or
lay
on
his
bed
in
the
veranda
dozing
the
senora
went
her
usual
rounds
of
inspection
fed
her
birds
spoke
to
every
one
in
her
usual
tone
sat
in
her
carved
chair
with
her
hands
folded
gazing
out
on
the
southern
sky
ramona
busied
herself
with
her
usual
duties
dusted
the
chapel
put
fresh
flowers
before
all
the
madonnas
and
then
sat
down
at
her
embroidery
ramona
had
been
for
a
long
time
at
work
on
a
beautiful
for
the
chapel
it
was
to
have
been
a
present
to
the
senora
it
was
nearly
done
as
she
held
up
the
frame
in
which
it
was
stretched
and
looked
at
the
delicate
tracery
of
the
pattern
she
sighed
it
had
been
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
interest
and
hopelessness
that
she
had
for
months
been
at
work
on
it
often
saying
to
herself
she
wo
care
much
for
it
beautiful
as
it
is
just
because
i
did
it
but
father
salvierderra
will
be
pleased
when
he
sees
now
as
she
wove
the
fine
threads
in
and
out
she
thought
she
will
never
let
it
be
used
on
the
altar
i
wonder
if
i
could
any
way
get
it
to
father
salvierderra
at
santa
barbara
i
would
like
to
give
it
to
him
i
will
ask
alessandro
i
sure
the
senora
would
never
use
it
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
leave
it
here
i
shall
take
it
with
but
as
she
thought
these
things
her
face
was
unruffled
a
strange
composure
had
settled
on
ramona
only
four
days
only
four
days
i
can
bear
anything
for
four
days
these
words
were
coming
and
going
in
her
mind
like
refrains
of
songs
which
haunt
one
memory
and
will
not
be
still
she
saw
that
felipe
looked
anxiously
at
her
but
she
answered
his
inquiring
looks
always
with
a
gentle
smile
it
was
evident
that
the
senora
did
not
intend
that
she
and
felipe
should
have
any
private
conversation
but
that
did
not
so
much
matter
after
all
there
was
not
so
much
to
be
said
felipe
knew
all
she
could
tell
him
nothing
felipe
had
acted
for
the
best
as
he
thought
in
sending
alessandro
away
till
the
heat
of
the
senora
anger
should
have
spent
itself
after
her
first
dismay
at
suddenly
learning
that
alessandro
had
gone
had
passed
she
had
reflected
that
it
was
just
as
well
he
would
come
back
prepared
to
take
her
with
him
how
or
where
she
did
not
know
but
she
would
go
with
no
questions
perhaps
she
would
not
even
bid
the
senora
she
wondered
how
that
would
arrange
itself
and
how
far
alessandro
would
have
to
take
her
to
find
a
priest
to
marry
them
it
was
a
terrible
thing
to
have
to
do
to
go
out
of
a
home
in
such
a
way
no
wedding
no
wedding
clothes
no
friends
to
go
unmarried
and
journey
to
a
priest
house
to
have
the
ceremony
performed
but
it
is
not
my
fault
said
ramona
to
herself
it
is
hers
she
drives
me
to
do
it
if
it
is
wrong
the
blame
will
be
hers
father
salvierderra
would
gladly
come
here
and
marry
us
if
she
would
send
for
him
i
wish
we
could
go
to
him
alessandro
and
i
perhaps
we
can
i
would
not
be
afraid
to
ride
so
far
we
could
do
it
in
two
the
more
ramona
thought
of
this
the
more
it
appeared
to
her
the
natural
thing
for
them
to
do
he
will
be
on
our
side
i
know
he
will
she
thought
he
always
liked
alessandro
and
he
loves
it
was
strange
how
little
bitterness
toward
the
senora
was
in
the
mind
how
comparatively
little
she
thought
of
her
her
heart
was
too
full
of
alessandro
and
of
their
future
and
it
had
never
been
habit
to
dwell
on
the
senora
in
her
thoughts
as
from
her
childhood
up
she
had
accepted
the
fact
of
the
senora
coldness
toward
her
so
now
she
accepted
her
injustice
and
opposition
as
part
of
the
nature
of
things
and
not
to
be
altered
during
all
these
hours
during
the
coming
and
going
of
these
crowds
of
fears
sorrows
memories
anticipations
in
ramona
heart
all
that
there
was
to
be
seen
to
the
eye
was
simply
a
calm
quiet
girl
sitting
on
the
veranda
diligently
working
at
her
even
felipe
was
deceived
by
her
calmness
and
wondered
what
it
meant
if
it
could
be
that
she
was
undergoing
the
change
that
his
mother
had
thought
possible
and
designated
as
coming
to
her
even
felipe
did
not
know
the
steadfast
fibre
of
the
girl
nature
neither
did
he
realize
what
a
bond
had
grown
between
her
and
alessandro
in
fact
he
sometimes
wondered
of
what
this
bond
had
been
made
he
had
himself
seen
the
greater
part
of
their
intercourse
with
each
other
nothing
could
have
been
farther
removed
from
anything
like
there
had
been
no
crisis
of
incident
or
marked
moments
of
experience
such
as
in
imaginations
of
love
were
essential
to
the
fulness
of
its
growth
this
is
a
common
mistake
on
the
part
of
those
who
have
never
felt
love
true
bonds
once
in
those
chains
one
perceives
that
they
are
not
of
the
sort
full
forged
in
a
day
they
are
made
as
the
great
iron
cables
are
made
on
which
bridges
are
swung
across
the
widest
not
of
single
huge
rods
or
bars
which
would
be
stronger
perhaps
to
look
at
but
of
myriads
of
the
finest
wires
each
one
by
itself
so
fine
so
frail
it
would
barely
hold
a
child
kite
in
the
wind
by
hundreds
hundreds
of
thousands
of
such
twisted
together
are
made
the
mighty
cables
which
do
not
any
more
swerve
from
their
place
in
the
air
under
the
weight
and
jar
of
the
ceaseless
traffic
and
tread
of
two
cities
than
the
solid
earth
swerves
under
the
same
ceaseless
weight
and
jar
such
cables
do
not
break
even
ramona
herself
would
have
found
it
hard
to
tell
why
she
thus
loved
alessandro
how
it
began
or
by
what
it
grew
it
had
not
been
a
sudden
adoration
like
his
passion
for
her
it
was
in
the
beginning
simply
a
response
but
now
it
was
as
strong
a
love
as
his
as
strong
and
as
unchangeable
the
senora
harsh
words
had
been
like
a
air
to
it
and
the
sudden
knowledge
of
the
fact
of
her
own
indian
descent
seemed
to
her
like
a
revelation
pointing
out
the
path
in
which
destiny
called
her
to
walk
she
thrilled
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
the
joy
with
which
alessandro
would
hear
this
the
joy
and
the
surprise
she
imagined
to
herself
in
hundreds
of
ways
the
time
place
and
phrase
in
which
she
would
tell
him
she
could
not
satisfy
herself
as
to
the
best
as
to
which
would
give
keenest
pleasure
to
him
and
to
her
she
would
tell
him
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
it
should
be
her
first
word
of
greeting
no
there
would
be
too
much
of
trouble
and
embarrassment
then
she
would
wait
till
they
were
far
away
till
they
were
alone
in
the
wilderness
and
then
she
would
turn
to
him
and
say
alessandro
my
people
are
your
people
or
she
would
wait
and
keep
her
secret
until
she
had
reached
temecula
and
they
had
begun
their
life
there
and
alessandro
had
been
astonished
to
see
how
readily
and
kindly
she
took
to
all
the
ways
of
the
indian
village
and
then
when
he
expressed
some
such
emotion
she
would
quietly
say
but
i
too
am
an
indian
alessandro
strange
sad
bride
dreams
these
but
they
made
ramona
heart
beat
with
happiness
as
she
dreamed
them
xiv
the
first
day
had
gone
it
was
near
night
of
the
second
and
not
a
word
had
passed
between
felipe
and
ramona
except
in
the
presence
of
the
senora
it
would
have
been
beautiful
to
see
if
it
had
not
been
so
cruel
a
thing
the
various
and
devious
methods
by
which
the
senora
had
brought
this
about
felipe
oddly
enough
was
more
restive
under
it
than
ramona
she
had
her
dreams
he
had
nothing
but
his
restless
consciousness
that
he
had
not
done
for
her
what
he
hoped
that
he
must
seem
to
her
to
have
been
disloyal
this
and
a
continual
wonder
what
she
could
be
planning
or
expecting
which
made
her
so
placid
kept
felipe
in
a
fever
of
unrest
of
which
his
mother
noted
every
sign
and
redoubled
her
vigilance
felipe
thought
perhaps
he
could
speak
to
ramona
in
the
night
through
her
window
but
the
august
heats
were
fierce
now
everybody
slept
with
windows
the
senora
was
always
wakeful
if
she
should
chance
to
hear
him
thus
holding
secret
converse
with
ramona
it
would
indeed
make
bad
matters
worse
nevertheless
he
decided
to
try
it
at
the
first
sound
of
his
footsteps
on
the
veranda
floor
my
son
are
you
ill
can
i
do
anything
came
from
the
senora
window
she
had
not
been
asleep
at
all
it
would
take
more
courage
than
felipe
possessed
to
try
that
plan
again
and
he
lay
on
his
veranda
bed
this
afternoon
tossing
about
with
sheer
impatience
at
his
baffled
purpose
ramona
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
taking
the
last
stitches
in
the
nearly
completed
the
senora
sat
in
her
usual
seat
dozing
with
her
head
thrown
back
it
was
very
hot
a
sultry
with
dust
from
the
desert
had
been
blowing
all
day
and
every
living
creature
was
more
or
less
prostrated
by
it
as
the
senora
eyes
closed
a
sudden
thought
struck
felipe
taking
out
a
in
which
he
kept
his
accounts
he
began
rapidly
writing
looking
up
and
catching
ramona
eye
he
made
a
sign
to
her
that
it
was
for
her
she
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
senora
she
was
asleep
presently
felipe
folding
the
note
and
concealing
it
in
his
hand
rose
and
walked
towards
ramona
window
ramona
terrifiedly
watching
him
the
sound
of
felipe
steps
roused
the
senora
who
sat
up
instantly
and
gazed
about
her
with
that
indescribable
expression
peculiar
to
people
who
hope
they
have
not
been
asleep
but
know
they
have
have
i
been
asleep
she
asked
about
one
minute
mother
answered
felipe
who
was
leaning
as
he
spoke
against
ramona
open
window
his
arms
crossed
behind
him
stretching
them
out
and
back
and
forth
a
few
times
yawning
idly
he
said
this
heat
is
intolerable
then
he
sauntered
leisurely
down
the
veranda
steps
into
the
and
seated
himself
on
the
bench
under
the
trellis
there
the
note
had
been
thrown
into
ramona
room
she
was
hot
and
cold
with
fear
lest
she
might
not
be
able
to
get
it
unobserved
what
if
the
senora
were
to
go
first
into
the
room
she
hardly
dared
look
at
her
but
fortune
is
not
always
on
the
side
of
tyrants
the
senora
was
fast
dozing
off
again
relieved
that
felipe
was
out
of
speaking
distance
of
ramona
as
soon
as
her
eyes
were
again
shut
ramona
rose
to
go
the
senora
opened
her
eyes
ramona
was
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
door
she
was
going
into
the
house
good
still
farther
away
from
felipe
are
you
going
to
your
room
ramona
said
the
senor
i
was
replied
ramona
alarmed
did
you
want
me
here
no
said
the
senora
and
she
closed
her
eyes
again
in
a
second
more
the
note
was
safe
in
ramona
hands
dear
ramona
felipe
had
written
i
am
distracted
because
i
can
not
speak
with
you
alone
can
you
think
of
any
way
i
want
to
explain
things
to
you
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
understand
do
be
unhappy
alessandro
will
surely
be
back
in
four
days
i
want
to
help
you
all
i
can
but
you
saw
i
could
not
do
much
nobody
will
hinder
your
doing
what
you
please
but
dear
i
wish
you
would
not
go
away
from
us
tearing
the
paper
into
small
fragments
ramona
thrust
them
into
her
bosom
to
be
destroyed
later
then
looking
out
of
the
window
and
seeing
that
the
senora
was
now
in
a
sound
sleep
she
ventured
to
write
a
reply
to
felipe
though
when
she
would
find
a
safe
opportunity
to
give
it
to
him
there
was
no
telling
thank
you
dear
felipe
do
be
anxious
i
am
not
unhappy
i
understand
all
about
it
but
i
must
go
away
as
soon
as
alessandro
hiding
this
also
safe
in
her
bosom
she
went
back
to
the
veranda
felipe
rose
and
walked
toward
the
steps
ramona
suddenly
bold
stooped
and
laid
her
note
on
the
second
step
again
the
tired
eyes
of
the
senora
opened
they
had
not
been
shut
five
minutes
ramona
was
at
her
work
felipe
was
coming
up
the
steps
from
the
garden
he
nodded
laughingly
to
his
mother
and
laid
his
finger
on
his
lips
all
was
well
the
senora
dozed
again
her
nap
had
cost
her
more
than
she
would
ever
know
this
one
secret
interchange
between
felipe
and
ramona
then
thus
making
as
it
were
common
cause
with
each
other
as
against
her
and
in
fear
of
her
was
a
step
never
to
be
recalled
a
step
whose
significance
could
scarcely
be
overestimated
tyrants
great
and
small
are
apt
to
overlook
such
possibilities
as
this
to
forget
the
momentousness
which
the
most
trivial
incident
may
assume
when
forced
into
false
proportions
and
relations
tyranny
can
make
liars
and
cheats
out
of
the
honestest
souls
it
is
done
oftener
than
any
except
close
students
of
human
nature
realize
when
kings
and
emperors
do
this
the
world
cries
out
with
sympathy
and
holds
the
plotters
more
innocent
than
the
tyrant
who
provoked
the
plot
it
is
russia
that
stands
branded
in
men
thoughts
and
not
siberia
the
senora
had
a
siberia
of
her
own
and
it
was
there
that
ramona
was
living
in
these
days
the
senora
would
have
been
surprised
to
know
how
little
the
girl
felt
the
cold
to
be
sure
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
ever
felt
warmth
in
the
senora
presence
yet
between
the
former
chill
and
this
were
many
degrees
and
except
for
her
new
life
and
new
love
and
hope
in
the
thought
of
alessandro
ramona
could
not
have
borne
it
for
a
day
the
fourth
day
came
it
seemed
strangely
longer
than
the
others
had
all
day
ramona
watched
and
listened
felipe
too
for
knowing
what
alessandro
impatience
would
be
he
had
in
truth
looked
for
him
on
the
previous
night
the
horse
he
rode
was
a
fleet
one
and
would
have
made
the
journey
with
ease
in
half
the
time
but
felipe
reflected
that
there
might
be
many
things
for
alessandro
to
arrange
at
temecula
he
would
doubtless
return
prepared
to
take
ramona
back
with
him
in
case
that
proved
the
only
alternative
left
them
felipe
grew
wretched
as
his
fancy
dwelt
on
the
picture
of
ramona
future
he
had
been
in
the
temecula
village
he
knew
its
poverty
the
thought
of
ramona
there
was
monstrous
to
the
indolent
felipe
it
was
incredible
that
a
girl
reared
as
ramona
had
been
could
for
a
moment
contemplate
leading
the
life
of
a
poor
laboring
man
wife
he
could
not
conceive
of
making
one
undertake
any
such
life
felipe
had
much
to
learn
of
love
night
came
no
alessandro
till
the
darkness
settled
down
ramona
sat
watching
the
willows
when
she
could
no
longer
see
she
listened
the
senora
noting
all
also
listened
she
was
uneasy
as
to
the
next
stage
of
affairs
but
she
would
not
speak
nothing
should
induce
her
to
swerve
from
the
line
of
conduct
on
which
she
had
determined
it
was
the
full
of
the
moon
when
the
first
broad
beam
of
its
light
came
over
the
hill
and
flooded
the
garden
and
the
white
front
of
the
little
chapel
just
as
it
had
done
on
that
first
night
when
alessandro
watched
with
felipe
on
the
veranda
ramona
pressed
her
face
against
the
and
gazed
out
into
the
garden
at
each
flickering
motion
of
the
shadows
she
saw
the
form
of
a
man
approaching
again
and
again
she
saw
it
again
and
again
the
breeze
died
and
the
shadow
ceased
it
was
near
morning
before
weary
sad
she
crept
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
with
anxious
eyes
she
still
watched
and
listened
never
had
the
thought
once
crossed
her
mind
that
alessandro
might
not
come
at
the
time
felipe
had
said
in
her
childlike
simplicity
she
had
accepted
this
as
unquestioningly
as
she
had
accepted
other
facts
in
her
life
now
that
he
did
not
come
unreasoning
and
unfounded
terror
took
possession
of
her
and
she
asked
herself
continually
will
he
ever
come
they
sent
him
away
perhaps
he
will
be
too
proud
to
come
back
then
faith
would
return
and
saying
to
herself
he
would
never
never
forsake
me
he
knows
i
have
no
one
in
the
whole
world
but
him
he
knows
how
i
love
him
she
would
regain
composure
and
remind
herself
of
the
many
detentions
which
might
have
prevented
his
coming
at
the
time
set
spite
of
all
however
she
was
heavy
at
heart
and
at
breakfast
her
anxious
eyes
and
absent
look
were
sad
to
see
they
hurt
felipe
too
well
he
knew
what
it
meant
he
also
was
anxious
the
senora
saw
it
in
his
face
and
it
vexed
her
the
girl
might
well
pine
and
be
mortified
if
her
lover
did
not
appear
but
why
should
felipe
disquiet
himself
the
senora
disliked
it
it
was
a
bad
symptom
there
might
be
trouble
ahead
yet
there
was
indeed
trouble
ahead
of
a
sort
the
senora
imaginings
had
not
pictured
another
day
passed
another
night
another
and
another
one
week
now
since
alessandro
as
he
leaped
on
his
horse
had
grasped
felipe
hand
and
said
you
will
tell
the
senorita
you
will
make
sure
that
she
understands
why
i
go
and
in
four
days
i
will
be
one
week
and
he
had
not
come
the
three
who
were
watching
and
wondering
looked
covertly
into
each
other
faces
each
longing
to
know
what
the
others
thought
ramona
was
wan
and
haggard
she
had
scarcely
slept
the
idea
had
taken
possession
of
her
that
alessandro
was
dead
on
the
sixth
and
seventh
days
she
had
walked
each
afternoon
far
down
the
river
road
by
which
he
would
be
sure
to
come
down
the
meadows
and
by
the
out
to
the
highway
at
each
step
straining
her
tearful
eyes
into
the
distance
the
cruel
blank
silent
distance
she
had
come
back
after
dark
whiter
and
more
wan
than
she
went
out
as
she
sat
at
the
silent
making
no
feint
of
eating
only
drinking
glass
after
glass
of
milk
in
thirsty
haste
even
margarita
pitied
her
but
the
senora
did
not
she
thought
the
best
thing
which
could
happen
would
be
that
the
indian
should
never
come
back
ramona
would
recover
from
it
in
a
little
while
the
mortification
would
be
the
worst
thing
but
even
that
time
would
heal
she
wondered
that
the
girl
had
not
more
pride
than
to
let
her
wretchedness
be
so
plainly
seen
she
herself
would
have
died
before
she
would
go
about
with
such
a
face
for
a
whole
household
to
see
and
gossip
about
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
ramona
desperate
waylaid
felipe
as
he
was
going
down
the
veranda
steps
the
senora
was
in
the
garden
and
saw
them
but
ramona
did
not
care
felipe
she
cried
i
must
i
must
speak
to
you
do
you
think
alessandro
is
dead
what
else
could
keep
him
from
coming
her
lips
were
dry
her
cheeks
scarlet
her
voice
husky
a
few
more
days
of
this
and
she
would
be
in
a
brain
fever
felipe
thought
as
he
looked
compassionately
at
her
oh
no
no
dear
do
not
think
that
he
replied
a
thousand
things
might
have
kept
ten
thousand
things
would
not
nothing
could
said
ramona
i
know
he
is
dead
ca
you
send
a
messenger
felipe
and
see
the
senora
was
walking
toward
them
she
overheard
the
last
words
looking
toward
felipe
no
more
regarding
ramona
than
if
she
had
not
been
within
sight
or
hearing
the
senora
said
it
seems
to
me
that
would
not
be
quite
consistent
with
dignity
how
does
it
strike
you
felipe
if
you
thought
best
we
might
spare
a
man
as
soon
as
the
vintage
is
done
i
ramona
walked
away
the
vintage
would
not
be
over
for
a
week
there
were
several
vineyards
yet
which
had
not
been
touched
every
hand
on
the
place
was
hard
at
work
picking
the
grapes
treading
them
out
in
tubs
emptying
the
juice
into
stretched
swung
from
in
a
long
shed
in
the
willow
copse
the
was
in
full
blast
it
took
one
man
to
watch
it
this
was
juan
can
favorite
work
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
liked
best
to
do
it
alone
and
now
that
he
could
no
longer
tread
grapes
in
the
tubs
he
had
a
better
chance
for
uninterrupted
work
at
the
still
no
ill
but
has
its
good
he
thought
sometimes
as
he
lay
comfortably
stretched
out
in
the
shade
smoking
his
pipe
day
after
day
and
breathing
the
fumes
of
the
fiery
brandy
as
ramona
disappeared
in
the
doorway
the
senora
coming
close
to
felipe
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
said
in
a
confidential
tone
nodding
her
head
in
the
direction
in
which
ramona
had
vanished
she
looks
badly
felipe
i
do
know
what
we
can
do
we
surely
can
not
send
to
summon
back
a
lover
we
do
not
wish
her
to
marry
can
we
it
is
very
perplexing
most
unfortunate
every
way
what
do
you
think
my
son
there
was
almost
a
diabolical
art
in
the
manner
in
which
the
senora
could
by
a
single
phrase
or
question
plant
in
a
person
mind
the
precise
idea
she
wished
him
to
think
he
had
originated
himself
no
of
course
we
ca
send
for
him
replied
felipe
angrily
unless
it
is
to
send
him
to
marry
her
i
wish
he
had
never
set
foot
on
the
place
i
am
sure
i
do
know
what
to
do
ramona
looks
frighten
me
i
believe
she
will
i
can
not
wish
alessandro
had
never
set
foot
on
the
place
said
the
senora
gently
for
i
feel
that
i
owe
your
life
to
him
my
felipe
and
he
is
not
to
blame
for
ramona
conduct
you
need
not
fear
her
dying
she
may
be
ill
but
people
do
not
die
of
love
like
hers
for
of
what
kind
do
they
die
mother
asked
felipe
impatiently
the
senora
looked
reproachfully
at
him
not
often
of
any
she
said
but
certainly
not
of
a
sudden
passion
for
a
person
in
every
way
beneath
them
in
position
in
education
in
all
points
which
are
essential
to
congeniality
of
tastes
or
association
of
the
senora
spoke
calmly
with
no
excitement
as
if
she
were
discussing
an
abstract
case
sometimes
when
she
spoke
like
this
felipe
for
the
moment
felt
as
if
she
were
entirely
right
as
if
it
were
really
a
disgraceful
thing
in
ramona
to
have
thus
loved
alessandro
it
could
not
be
gainsaid
that
there
was
this
gulf
of
which
she
spoke
alessandro
was
undeniably
ramona
inferior
in
position
education
in
all
the
external
matters
of
life
but
in
nature
in
true
nobility
of
soul
no
alessandro
was
no
man
inferior
in
these
and
in
capacity
to
love
felipe
sometimes
wondered
whether
he
had
ever
known
alessandro
equal
in
that
this
thought
had
occurred
to
him
more
than
once
as
from
his
he
had
unobserved
studied
the
expression
with
which
alessandro
gazed
at
ramona
but
all
this
made
no
difference
in
the
perplexity
of
the
present
dilemma
in
the
embarrassment
of
his
and
his
mother
position
now
send
a
messenger
to
ask
why
alessandro
did
not
return
not
even
if
he
had
been
an
accepted
and
publicly
recognized
lover
would
felipe
do
that
ramona
ought
to
have
more
pride
she
ought
of
herself
to
know
that
and
when
felipe
later
in
the
day
saw
ramona
again
he
said
as
much
to
her
he
said
it
as
gently
as
he
could
so
gently
that
she
did
not
at
first
comprehend
his
idea
it
was
so
foreign
so
incompatible
with
her
faith
how
could
she
when
she
did
understand
she
said
slowly
you
mean
that
it
will
not
do
to
send
to
find
out
if
alessandro
is
dead
because
it
will
look
as
if
i
wished
him
to
marry
me
whether
he
wished
it
or
not
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
felipe
with
an
expression
he
could
not
fathom
yes
dear
he
answered
something
like
that
though
you
put
it
is
it
not
true
she
persisted
that
is
what
you
mean
reluctantly
felipe
admitted
that
it
was
ramona
was
silent
for
some
moments
then
she
said
speaking
still
more
slowly
if
you
feel
like
that
we
had
better
never
talk
about
alessandro
again
i
suppose
it
is
not
possible
that
you
should
know
as
i
do
that
nothing
but
his
being
dead
would
keep
him
from
coming
back
thanks
dear
felipe
and
after
this
she
did
not
speak
again
of
alessandro
days
went
by
a
week
the
vintage
was
over
the
senora
wondered
if
ramona
would
now
ask
again
for
a
messenger
to
go
to
temecula
almost
even
the
senora
relented
as
she
looked
into
the
girl
white
and
wasted
face
as
she
sat
silent
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
willows
the
was
done
folded
and
laid
away
it
would
never
hang
in
the
moreno
chapel
it
was
promised
in
ramona
mind
to
father
salvierderra
she
had
resolved
to
go
to
him
if
he
a
feeble
old
man
could
walk
all
the
way
between
santa
barbara
and
their
home
she
could
surely
do
the
same
she
would
not
lose
the
way
there
were
not
many
roads
she
could
ask
the
convent
the
bare
thought
of
which
had
been
so
terrible
to
ramona
fourteen
days
ago
when
the
senora
had
threatened
her
with
it
now
seemed
a
heavenly
refuge
the
only
shelter
she
craved
there
was
a
school
for
orphans
attached
to
the
convent
at
san
juan
bautista
she
knew
she
would
ask
the
father
to
let
her
go
there
and
she
would
spend
the
rest
of
her
life
in
prayer
and
in
teaching
the
orphan
girls
as
hour
after
hour
she
sat
revolving
this
plan
her
fancy
projected
itself
so
vividly
into
the
future
that
she
lived
years
of
her
life
she
felt
herself
old
she
saw
the
procession
of
nuns
going
to
vespers
leading
the
children
by
the
hand
herself
wrinkled
and
walking
between
two
of
the
little
ones
the
picture
gave
her
peace
as
soon
as
she
grew
a
little
stronger
she
would
set
off
on
her
journey
to
the
father
she
could
not
go
just
yet
she
was
too
weak
her
feet
trembled
if
she
did
but
walk
to
the
foot
of
the
garden
alessandro
was
dead
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
he
was
buried
in
that
little
walled
graveyard
of
which
he
had
told
her
sometimes
she
thought
she
would
try
to
go
there
and
see
his
grave
perhaps
see
his
father
if
alessandro
had
told
him
of
her
the
old
man
would
be
glad
to
see
her
perhaps
after
all
her
work
might
lie
there
among
alessandro
people
but
this
looked
hard
she
had
not
courage
for
it
shelter
and
rest
were
what
she
wanted
the
sound
of
the
prayers
and
the
father
blessing
every
day
the
convent
was
the
best
she
thought
she
was
sure
that
alessandro
was
dead
but
she
was
not
for
she
still
listened
still
watched
each
day
she
walked
out
on
the
river
road
and
sat
waiting
till
dusk
at
last
came
a
day
when
she
could
not
go
her
strength
failed
her
she
lay
all
day
on
her
bed
to
the
senora
who
asked
frigidly
if
she
were
ill
she
answered
no
senora
i
do
not
think
i
am
ill
i
have
no
pain
but
i
can
not
get
up
i
shall
be
better
i
will
send
you
strong
broth
and
a
medicine
the
senora
said
and
sent
her
both
by
the
hands
of
margarita
whose
hatred
and
jealousy
broke
down
at
the
first
sight
of
ramona
face
on
the
pillow
it
looked
so
much
thinner
and
sharper
there
than
it
had
when
she
was
sitting
up
oh
senorita
senorita
she
cried
in
a
tone
of
poignant
grief
are
you
going
to
die
forgive
me
forgive
me
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
you
margarita
replied
ramona
raising
herself
on
her
elbow
and
lifting
her
eyes
kindly
to
the
girl
face
as
she
took
the
broth
from
her
hands
i
do
not
know
why
you
ask
me
to
forgive
margarita
flung
herself
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
in
a
passion
of
weeping
oh
but
you
do
know
senorita
you
do
know
forgive
me
no
i
know
nothing
replied
ramona
but
if
you
know
anything
it
is
all
forgiven
i
am
not
going
to
die
margarita
i
am
going
away
she
added
after
a
second
pause
her
inmost
instinct
told
her
that
she
could
trust
margarita
now
alessandro
being
dead
margarita
would
no
longer
be
her
enemy
and
margarita
could
perhaps
help
her
i
am
going
away
margarita
as
soon
as
i
feel
a
little
stronger
i
am
going
to
a
convent
but
the
senora
does
not
know
you
will
not
tell
no
senorita
whispered
margarita
thinking
in
her
heart
yes
she
is
going
away
but
it
will
be
with
the
no
senorita
i
will
not
tell
i
will
do
anything
you
want
me
thanks
margarita
mia
replied
ramona
i
thought
you
would
and
she
lay
back
on
her
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
looking
so
much
more
like
death
than
like
life
that
margarita
tears
flowed
faster
than
before
and
she
ran
to
her
mother
sobbing
out
mother
mother
the
senorita
is
ill
to
death
i
am
sure
she
is
she
has
taken
to
her
bed
and
she
is
as
white
as
senor
felipe
was
at
the
worst
of
the
ay
said
old
marda
who
had
seen
all
this
for
days
back
ay
she
has
wasted
away
this
last
week
like
one
in
a
fever
sure
enough
i
have
seen
it
it
must
be
she
is
starving
herself
to
indeed
she
has
not
eaten
for
ten
days
hardly
since
that
day
and
margarita
and
her
mother
exchanged
looks
it
was
not
necessary
to
further
define
the
day
juan
can
says
he
thinks
he
will
never
be
seen
here
again
continued
margarita
the
saints
grant
it
then
said
marda
hotly
if
it
is
he
has
cost
the
senorita
all
this
i
am
that
turned
about
in
my
head
with
it
all
that
i
no
thoughts
to
think
but
plain
enough
it
is
he
is
mixed
up
with
whatever
is
has
gone
i
could
tell
what
it
is
said
margarita
her
old
pertness
coming
uppermost
for
a
moment
but
i
got
no
more
to
say
now
the
lying
on
her
bed
with
the
face
she
got
it
enough
to
break
your
heart
to
look
at
her
i
could
just
go
down
on
my
knees
to
her
for
all
i
said
and
i
will
and
to
saint
francis
too
she
going
to
be
with
him
before
long
i
know
she
no
said
the
wiser
older
marda
she
is
not
so
ill
as
you
think
she
is
young
it
the
heart
gone
out
of
her
that
all
i
been
that
way
myself
people
are
when
they
i
young
retorted
margarita
i
never
been
that
there
many
a
mile
to
the
end
of
the
road
my
girl
said
marda
significantly
and
ill
boasting
the
first
day
out
was
a
proverb
when
i
was
your
age
marda
had
never
been
much
more
than
fond
of
this
own
child
of
hers
their
natures
were
antagonistic
traits
which
in
father
had
embittered
many
a
day
of
marda
early
married
life
were
perpetually
cropping
out
in
margarita
making
between
the
mother
and
daughter
a
barrier
which
even
parental
love
was
not
always
strong
enough
to
surmount
and
as
was
inevitable
this
antagonism
was
constantly
leading
to
things
which
seemed
to
margarita
and
in
fact
were
unjust
and
she
always
flinging
out
at
me
whatever
i
do
thought
margarita
i
know
one
thing
i
never
tell
her
what
the
senorita
told
me
never
not
till
after
she
a
sudden
suspicion
flashed
into
margarita
mind
she
seated
herself
on
the
bench
outside
the
kitchen
door
to
wrestle
with
it
what
if
it
were
not
to
a
convent
at
all
but
to
alessandro
that
the
senorita
meant
to
go
no
that
was
preposterous
if
it
had
been
that
she
would
have
gone
with
him
in
the
outset
nobody
who
was
plotting
to
run
away
with
a
lover
ever
wore
such
a
look
as
the
senorita
wore
now
margarita
dismissed
the
thought
yet
it
left
its
trace
she
would
be
more
observant
for
having
had
it
her
resuscitated
affection
far
her
young
mistress
was
not
yet
so
strong
that
it
would
resist
the
assaults
of
jealousy
if
that
passion
were
to
be
again
aroused
in
her
fiery
soul
though
she
had
never
been
deeply
in
love
with
alessandro
herself
she
had
been
enough
so
and
she
remembered
him
vividly
enough
to
feel
yet
a
sharp
emotion
of
displeasure
at
the
recollection
of
his
devotion
to
the
senorita
now
that
the
senorita
seemed
to
be
deserted
unhappy
prostrated
she
had
no
room
for
anything
but
pity
for
her
but
let
alessandro
come
on
the
stage
again
and
all
would
be
changed
the
old
hostility
would
return
it
was
but
a
dubious
sort
of
ally
after
all
that
ramona
had
so
unexpectedly
secured
in
margarita
she
might
prove
the
sharpest
of
broken
reeds
it
was
sunset
of
the
eighteenth
day
since
alessandro
departure
ramona
had
lain
for
four
days
motionless
on
her
bed
she
herself
began
to
think
she
must
be
going
to
die
her
mind
seemed
to
be
vacant
of
all
thought
she
did
not
even
sorrow
for
alessandro
death
she
seemed
torpid
body
and
soul
such
prostrations
as
these
are
nature
enforced
rests
it
is
often
only
by
help
of
them
that
our
bodies
tide
over
crises
strains
in
which
if
we
continued
to
battle
we
should
be
slain
as
ramona
lay
half
unconscious
neither
awake
nor
yet
asleep
on
this
evening
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
vivid
impression
produced
upon
her
it
was
not
sound
it
was
not
sight
she
was
alone
the
house
was
still
as
death
the
warm
september
twilight
silence
reigned
outside
she
sat
up
in
her
bed
intent
half
alarmed
half
glad
bewildered
alive
what
had
happened
still
there
was
no
sound
no
stir
the
twilight
was
fast
deepening
not
a
breath
of
air
moving
gradually
her
bewildered
senses
and
faculties
awoke
from
their
condition
she
looked
around
the
room
even
the
walls
seemed
revivified
she
clasped
her
hands
and
leaped
from
the
bed
alessandro
is
not
dead
she
said
aloud
and
she
laughed
hysterically
he
is
not
dead
she
repeated
he
is
not
dead
he
is
somewhere
near
with
quivering
hands
she
dressed
and
stole
out
of
the
house
after
the
first
few
seconds
she
found
herself
strangely
strong
she
did
not
tremble
her
feet
trod
firm
on
the
ground
oh
miracle
she
thought
as
she
hastened
down
the
i
am
well
again
alessandro
is
near
so
vivid
was
the
impression
that
when
she
reached
the
willows
and
found
the
spot
silent
vacant
as
when
she
had
last
sat
there
hopeless
she
experienced
a
revulsion
of
disappointment
not
here
she
cried
not
here
and
a
swift
fear
shook
her
am
i
mad
is
it
this
way
perhaps
people
lose
their
senses
when
they
are
as
i
have
been
but
the
young
strong
blood
was
running
swift
in
her
veins
no
this
was
no
madness
rather
a
newly
discovered
power
a
fulness
of
sense
a
revelation
alessandro
was
near
swiftly
she
walked
down
the
river
road
the
farther
she
went
the
keener
grew
her
expectation
her
sense
of
alessandro
nearness
in
her
present
mood
she
would
have
walked
on
and
on
even
to
temecula
itself
sure
that
she
was
at
each
step
drawing
nearer
to
alessandro
as
she
approached
the
second
willow
copse
which
lay
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
west
of
the
first
she
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
leaning
against
one
of
the
trees
she
halted
it
could
not
be
alessandro
he
would
not
have
paused
for
a
moment
so
near
the
house
where
he
was
to
find
her
she
was
afraid
to
go
on
it
was
late
to
meet
a
stranger
in
this
lonely
spot
the
figure
was
strangely
still
so
still
that
as
she
peered
through
the
dusk
she
half
fancied
it
might
be
an
optical
illusion
she
advanced
a
few
steps
hesitatingly
then
stopped
as
she
did
so
the
man
advanced
a
few
steps
then
stopped
as
he
came
out
from
the
shadows
of
the
trees
she
saw
that
he
was
of
height
she
quickened
her
steps
then
suddenly
stopped
again
what
did
this
mean
it
could
not
be
alessandro
ramona
wrung
her
hands
in
agony
of
suspense
an
almost
unconquerable
instinct
urged
her
forward
but
terror
held
her
back
after
standing
irresolute
for
some
minutes
she
turned
to
walk
back
to
the
house
saying
i
must
not
run
the
risk
of
its
being
a
stranger
if
it
is
alessandro
he
will
but
her
feet
seemed
to
refuse
to
move
in
the
opposite
direction
slower
and
slower
she
walked
for
a
few
paces
then
turned
again
the
man
had
returned
to
his
former
place
and
stood
as
at
first
leaning
against
the
tree
it
may
be
a
messenger
from
him
she
said
a
messenger
who
has
been
told
not
to
come
to
the
house
until
after
her
mind
was
made
up
she
quickened
her
pace
to
a
run
a
few
moments
more
brought
her
so
near
that
she
could
see
distinctly
it
was
yes
it
was
alessandro
he
did
not
see
her
his
face
was
turned
partially
away
his
head
resting
against
the
tree
he
must
be
ramona
flew
rather
than
ran
in
a
moment
more
alessandro
had
heard
the
light
steps
turned
saw
ramona
and
with
a
cry
bounded
forward
and
they
were
clasped
in
each
other
arms
before
they
had
looked
in
each
faces
ramona
spoke
first
disengaging
herself
gently
and
looking
up
she
began
alessandro
but
at
the
first
sight
of
his
face
she
shrieked
was
this
alessandro
this
haggard
emaciated
speechless
man
who
gazed
at
her
with
hollow
eyes
full
of
misery
and
no
joy
o
god
cried
ramona
you
have
been
ill
you
are
ill
my
god
alessandro
what
is
it
alessandro
passed
his
hand
slowly
over
his
forehead
as
if
trying
to
collect
his
thoughts
before
speaking
all
the
while
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
ramona
with
the
same
anguished
look
convulsively
holding
both
her
hands
in
his
senorita
he
said
my
senorita
then
he
stopped
his
tongue
seemed
to
refuse
him
utterance
and
this
voice
this
strange
hard
unresonant
voice
whose
voice
was
it
not
alessandro
my
senorita
he
began
again
i
could
not
go
without
one
sight
of
your
face
but
when
i
was
here
i
had
not
courage
to
go
near
the
house
if
you
had
not
come
i
should
have
gone
back
without
seeing
ramona
heard
these
words
in
terror
what
did
they
mean
her
look
seemed
to
suggest
a
new
thought
to
alessandro
heavens
senorita
he
cried
have
you
not
heard
do
you
not
know
what
has
happened
i
know
nothing
love
answered
ramona
i
have
heard
nothing
since
you
went
away
for
ten
days
i
have
been
sure
you
were
dead
but
something
told
me
that
you
were
near
and
i
came
to
meet
at
the
first
words
of
ramona
sentence
alessandro
threw
his
arms
around
her
again
as
she
said
love
his
whole
frame
shook
with
emotion
my
senorita
he
whispered
my
senorita
how
shall
i
tell
you
how
shall
i
tell
you
what
is
there
to
tell
alessandro
she
said
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
now
that
you
are
here
and
not
dead
as
i
but
alessandro
did
not
speak
it
seemed
impossible
at
last
straining
her
closer
to
his
breast
he
cried
dearest
senorita
i
feel
as
if
i
should
die
when
i
tell
you
i
have
no
home
my
father
is
dead
my
people
are
driven
out
of
their
village
i
am
only
a
beggar
now
senorita
like
those
you
used
to
feed
and
pity
in
los
angeles
convent
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
he
reeled
and
supporting
himself
against
the
tree
added
i
am
not
strong
senorita
we
have
been
ramona
face
did
not
reassure
him
even
in
the
dusk
he
could
see
its
look
of
incredulous
horror
he
misread
it
i
only
came
to
look
at
you
once
more
he
continued
i
will
go
now
may
the
saints
bless
you
my
senorita
always
i
think
the
virgin
sent
you
to
me
i
should
never
have
seen
your
face
if
you
had
not
while
he
was
speaking
ramona
had
buried
her
face
in
his
bosom
lifting
it
now
she
said
did
you
mean
to
leave
me
to
think
you
were
dead
alessandro
i
thought
that
the
news
about
our
village
must
have
reached
you
he
said
and
that
you
would
know
i
had
no
home
and
could
not
come
to
seem
to
remind
you
of
what
you
had
said
oh
senorita
it
was
little
enough
i
had
before
to
give
you
i
do
know
how
i
dared
to
believe
that
you
could
come
to
be
with
me
but
i
loved
you
so
much
i
had
thought
of
many
things
i
could
do
and
lowering
his
voice
and
speaking
almost
sullenly
it
is
the
saints
i
believe
who
have
punished
me
thus
for
having
resolved
to
leave
my
people
and
take
all
i
had
for
myself
and
you
now
they
have
left
me
nothing
and
he
groaned
who
cried
ramona
was
there
a
battle
was
your
father
killed
she
was
trembling
with
horror
no
answered
alessandro
there
was
no
battle
there
would
have
been
if
i
had
had
my
way
but
my
father
implored
me
not
to
resist
he
said
it
would
only
make
it
worse
for
us
in
the
end
the
sheriff
too
he
begged
me
to
let
it
all
go
on
peaceably
and
help
him
keep
the
people
quiet
he
felt
terribly
to
have
to
do
it
it
was
rothsaker
from
san
diego
we
had
often
worked
for
him
on
his
ranch
he
knew
all
about
us
do
you
recollect
senorita
i
told
you
about
him
how
fair
he
always
was
and
kind
too
he
has
the
biggest
in
cajon
we
harvested
miles
and
miles
of
wheat
for
him
he
said
he
would
have
rather
died
almost
than
have
had
it
to
do
but
if
we
resisted
he
would
have
to
order
his
men
to
shoot
he
had
twenty
men
with
him
they
thought
there
would
be
trouble
and
well
they
might
turning
a
whole
village
full
of
men
and
women
and
children
out
of
their
houses
and
driving
them
off
like
foxes
if
it
had
been
any
man
but
rothsaker
i
would
have
shot
him
dead
if
i
had
hung
for
it
but
i
knew
if
he
thought
we
must
go
there
was
no
help
for
but
alessandro
interrupted
ramona
i
ca
understand
who
was
it
made
rothsaker
do
it
who
has
the
land
now
i
do
know
who
they
are
alessandro
replied
his
voice
full
of
anger
and
scorn
they
americans
eight
or
ten
of
them
they
all
got
together
and
brought
a
suit
they
call
it
up
in
san
francisco
and
it
was
decided
in
the
court
that
they
owned
all
our
land
that
was
all
rothsaker
could
tell
about
it
it
was
the
law
he
said
and
nobody
could
go
against
the
oh
said
ramona
that
the
way
the
americans
took
so
much
of
the
senora
land
away
from
her
it
was
in
the
court
up
in
san
francisco
and
they
decided
that
miles
and
miles
of
her
land
which
the
general
had
always
had
was
not
hers
at
all
they
said
it
belonged
to
the
united
states
they
are
a
pack
of
thieves
and
liars
every
one
of
them
cried
alessandro
they
are
going
to
steal
all
the
land
in
this
country
we
might
all
just
as
well
throw
ourselves
into
the
sea
and
let
them
have
it
my
father
had
been
telling
me
this
for
years
he
saw
it
coming
but
i
did
not
believe
him
i
did
not
think
men
could
be
so
wicked
but
he
was
right
i
am
glad
he
is
dead
that
is
the
only
thing
i
have
to
be
thankful
for
now
one
day
i
thought
he
was
going
to
get
well
and
i
prayed
to
the
virgin
not
to
let
him
i
did
not
want
him
to
live
he
never
knew
anything
clear
after
they
took
him
out
of
his
house
that
was
before
i
got
there
i
found
him
sitting
on
the
ground
outside
they
said
it
was
the
sun
that
had
turned
him
crazy
but
it
was
not
it
was
his
heart
breaking
in
his
bosom
he
would
not
come
out
of
his
house
and
the
men
lifted
him
up
and
carried
him
out
by
force
and
threw
him
on
the
ground
and
then
they
threw
out
all
the
furniture
we
had
and
when
he
saw
them
doing
that
he
put
his
hands
up
to
his
head
and
called
out
alessandro
and
i
was
not
there
senorita
they
said
it
was
a
voice
to
make
the
dead
hear
that
he
called
with
and
nobody
could
stop
him
all
that
day
and
all
the
night
he
kept
on
calling
god
senorita
i
wonder
i
did
not
die
when
they
told
me
when
i
got
there
some
one
had
built
up
a
little
booth
of
tule
over
his
head
to
keep
the
sun
off
he
did
not
call
any
more
only
for
water
water
that
was
what
made
them
think
the
sun
had
done
it
they
did
all
they
could
but
it
was
such
a
dreadful
time
nobody
could
do
much
the
sheriff
men
were
in
great
hurry
they
gave
no
time
they
said
the
people
must
all
be
off
in
two
days
everybody
was
running
hither
and
thither
everything
out
of
the
houses
in
piles
on
the
ground
the
people
took
all
the
roofs
off
their
houses
too
they
were
made
of
the
tule
reeds
so
they
would
do
again
oh
senorita
do
ask
me
to
tell
you
any
more
it
is
like
death
i
ca
ramona
was
crying
bitterly
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
what
was
love
in
face
of
such
calamity
what
had
she
to
give
to
a
man
stricken
like
this
do
weep
senorita
said
alessandro
drearily
tears
kill
one
and
do
no
how
long
did
your
father
live
asked
ramona
clasping
her
arms
closer
around
his
neck
they
were
sitting
on
the
ground
now
and
ramona
yearning
over
alessandro
as
if
she
were
the
strong
one
and
he
the
one
to
be
sheltered
had
drawn
his
head
to
her
bosom
caressing
him
as
if
he
had
been
hers
for
years
nothing
could
have
so
clearly
shown
his
enfeebled
and
benumbed
condition
as
the
manner
in
which
he
received
these
caresses
which
once
would
have
made
him
beside
himself
with
joy
he
leaned
against
her
breast
as
a
child
might
he
he
died
only
four
days
ago
i
stayed
to
bury
him
and
then
i
came
away
i
have
been
three
days
on
the
way
the
horse
poor
beast
is
almost
weaker
than
i
the
americans
took
my
horse
alessandro
said
took
your
horse
cried
ramona
aghast
is
that
the
law
too
so
rothsaker
told
me
he
said
the
judge
had
said
he
must
take
enough
of
our
cattle
and
horses
to
pay
all
it
had
cost
for
the
suit
up
in
san
francisco
they
did
reckon
the
cattle
at
what
they
were
worth
i
thought
but
they
said
cattle
were
selling
very
low
now
there
were
not
enough
in
all
the
village
to
pay
it
so
we
had
to
make
it
up
in
horses
and
they
took
mine
i
was
not
there
the
day
they
drove
the
cattle
away
or
i
would
have
put
a
ball
into
benito
head
before
any
american
should
ever
have
had
him
to
ride
but
i
was
over
in
pachanga
with
my
father
he
would
not
stir
a
step
for
anybody
but
me
so
i
led
him
all
the
way
and
then
after
he
got
there
he
was
so
ill
i
never
left
him
a
minute
he
did
not
know
me
any
more
nor
know
anything
that
had
happened
i
built
a
little
hut
of
tule
and
he
lay
on
the
ground
till
he
died
when
i
put
him
in
his
grave
i
was
in
temecula
asked
ramona
in
exclaimed
alessandro
fiercely
you
do
seem
to
understand
senorita
we
have
no
right
in
temecula
not
even
to
our
graveyard
full
of
the
dead
rothsaker
warned
us
all
not
to
be
hanging
about
there
for
he
said
the
men
who
were
coming
in
were
a
rough
set
and
they
would
shoot
any
indian
at
sight
if
they
saw
him
trespassing
on
their
their
property
ejaculated
ramona
yes
it
is
theirs
said
alessandro
doggedly
that
is
the
law
they
got
all
the
papers
to
show
it
that
is
what
my
father
always
said
if
the
senor
valdez
had
only
given
him
a
paper
but
they
never
did
in
those
days
nobody
had
papers
the
american
law
is
it
a
law
of
thieves
cried
ramona
yes
and
of
murderers
too
said
alessandro
do
you
call
my
father
murdered
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
shot
him
i
do
and
o
senorita
my
senorita
there
was
jose
you
recollect
jose
who
went
for
my
violin
but
my
beloved
one
i
am
killing
you
with
these
terrible
things
i
will
speak
no
no
no
alessandro
tell
me
all
all
you
must
have
no
grief
i
do
not
share
tell
me
about
jose
cried
ramona
breathlessly
senorita
it
will
break
your
heart
to
hear
jose
was
married
a
year
ago
he
had
the
best
house
in
temecula
next
to
my
father
it
was
the
only
other
one
that
had
a
shingled
roof
and
he
had
a
barn
too
and
that
splendid
horse
he
rode
and
oxen
and
a
flock
of
sheep
he
was
at
home
when
the
sheriff
came
a
great
many
of
the
men
were
away
grapepicking
that
made
it
worse
but
jose
was
at
home
for
his
wife
had
a
little
baby
only
a
few
weeks
old
and
the
child
seemed
sickly
and
not
like
to
live
and
jose
would
not
leave
it
jose
was
the
first
one
that
saw
the
sheriff
riding
into
the
village
and
the
band
of
armed
men
behind
him
and
jose
knew
what
it
meant
he
had
often
talked
it
over
with
me
and
with
my
father
and
now
he
saw
that
it
had
come
and
he
went
crazy
in
one
minute
and
fell
on
the
ground
all
froth
at
his
mouth
he
had
had
a
fit
like
that
once
before
and
the
doctor
said
if
he
had
another
he
would
die
but
he
did
not
they
picked
him
up
and
presently
he
was
better
and
rothsaker
said
nobody
worked
so
well
in
the
moving
the
first
day
as
jose
did
most
of
the
men
would
not
lift
a
hand
they
sat
on
the
ground
with
the
women
and
covered
up
their
faces
and
would
not
see
but
jose
worked
and
senorita
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
run
with
my
father
violin
to
the
store
to
hartsel
and
ask
her
to
hide
it
for
us
jose
knew
it
was
worth
money
but
before
noon
the
second
day
he
had
another
fit
and
died
in
it
died
right
in
his
own
door
carrying
out
some
of
the
things
and
after
carmena
that
his
wife
name
saw
he
was
dead
she
never
spoke
but
sat
rocking
back
and
forth
on
the
ground
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
went
over
to
pachanga
at
the
same
time
i
did
with
my
father
it
was
a
long
procession
of
where
is
pachanga
asked
ramona
about
three
miles
from
temecula
a
little
sort
of
canon
i
told
the
people
they
better
move
over
there
the
land
did
not
belong
to
anybody
and
perhaps
they
could
make
a
living
there
there
is
any
water
that
the
worst
of
no
water
cried
ramona
no
running
water
there
is
one
little
spring
and
they
dug
a
well
by
it
as
soon
as
they
got
there
so
there
was
water
to
drink
but
that
is
all
i
saw
carmena
could
hardly
keep
up
and
i
carried
the
baby
for
her
on
one
arm
while
i
led
my
father
with
the
other
hand
but
the
baby
cried
so
she
took
it
back
i
thought
then
it
would
live
the
day
out
but
it
did
live
till
the
morning
of
the
day
my
father
died
just
a
few
hours
before
he
died
carmena
came
along
with
the
baby
rolled
up
in
her
shawl
and
sat
down
by
me
on
the
ground
and
did
not
speak
when
i
said
is
the
little
one
she
opened
her
shawl
and
showed
it
to
me
dead
carmena
said
i
is
good
my
father
is
dying
too
we
will
bury
them
together
so
she
sat
by
me
all
that
morning
and
at
night
she
helped
me
dig
the
graves
i
wanted
to
put
the
baby
on
my
breast
but
she
said
no
it
must
have
a
little
grave
so
she
dug
it
herself
and
we
put
them
in
and
she
never
spoke
except
that
once
she
was
sitting
there
by
the
grave
when
i
came
away
i
made
a
cross
of
two
little
trees
with
the
boughs
chopped
off
and
set
it
up
by
the
graves
so
that
is
the
way
our
new
graveyard
was
begun
my
father
and
the
little
baby
it
is
the
very
young
and
the
very
old
that
have
the
blessed
fortune
to
die
i
can
not
die
it
seems
where
did
they
bury
jose
gasped
ramona
in
temecula
said
alessandro
mr
rothsaker
made
two
of
his
men
dig
a
grave
in
our
old
graveyard
for
jose
but
i
think
carmena
will
go
at
night
and
bring
his
body
away
i
would
but
my
senorita
it
is
very
dark
i
can
hardly
see
your
beloved
eyes
i
think
you
must
not
stay
longer
can
i
go
as
far
as
the
brook
with
you
safely
without
being
seen
the
saints
bless
you
beloved
for
coming
i
could
not
have
lived
i
think
without
one
more
sight
of
your
face
and
springing
to
his
feet
alessandro
stood
waiting
for
ramona
to
move
she
remained
still
she
was
in
a
sore
strait
her
heart
held
but
one
impulse
one
desire
to
go
with
alessandro
nothing
was
apparently
farther
from
his
thoughts
than
this
could
she
offer
to
go
should
she
risk
laying
a
burden
on
him
greater
than
he
could
bear
if
he
were
indeed
a
beggar
as
he
said
would
his
life
be
hindered
or
helped
by
her
she
felt
herself
strong
and
able
work
had
no
terrors
for
her
privations
she
knew
nothing
of
but
she
felt
no
fear
of
them
alessandro
she
said
in
a
tone
which
startled
him
my
senorita
he
said
tenderly
you
have
never
once
called
me
i
can
not
senorita
he
replied
why
not
i
do
not
know
i
sometimes
think
he
added
faintly
but
not
often
if
i
think
of
you
by
any
other
name
than
as
my
senorita
it
is
usually
by
a
name
you
never
what
is
it
exclaimed
ramona
wonderingly
an
indian
word
my
dearest
one
the
name
of
the
bird
you
are
like
the
in
the
luiseno
tongue
that
is
majel
that
was
what
i
thought
my
people
would
have
called
you
if
you
had
come
to
dwell
among
us
it
is
a
beautiful
name
senorita
and
is
like
alessandro
was
still
standing
ramona
rose
coming
close
to
him
she
laid
both
her
hands
on
his
breast
and
her
head
on
her
hands
and
said
alessandro
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
am
an
indian
i
belong
to
your
alessandro
silence
astonished
her
you
are
surprised
she
said
i
thought
you
would
be
the
gladness
of
it
came
to
me
long
ago
my
senorita
he
said
i
knew
it
how
cried
ramona
and
you
never
told
me
alessandro
how
could
i
he
replied
i
dared
not
juan
canito
it
was
told
juan
canito
said
ramona
musingly
how
could
he
have
known
then
in
a
few
rapid
words
she
told
alessandro
all
that
the
senora
had
told
her
is
that
what
juan
can
said
she
asked
all
except
the
father
name
stammered
alessandro
who
did
he
say
was
my
father
she
asked
alessandro
was
silent
it
matters
not
said
ramona
he
was
wrong
the
senora
of
course
knew
he
was
a
friend
of
hers
and
of
the
senora
ortegna
to
whom
he
gave
me
but
i
think
alessandro
i
have
more
of
my
mother
than
of
my
yes
you
have
my
senorita
replied
alessandro
tenderly
after
i
knew
it
i
then
saw
what
it
was
in
your
face
had
always
seemed
to
me
like
the
faces
of
my
own
are
you
not
glad
alessandro
yes
my
what
more
should
ramona
say
suddenly
her
heart
gave
way
and
without
premeditation
without
resolve
almost
without
consciousness
of
what
she
was
doing
she
flung
herself
on
alessandro
breast
and
cried
oh
alessandro
take
me
with
you
take
me
with
you
i
would
rather
die
than
have
you
leave
me
again
xv
alessandro
first
answer
to
this
cry
of
ramona
was
a
tightening
of
his
arms
around
her
closer
and
closer
he
held
her
till
it
was
almost
pain
she
could
hear
the
throbs
of
his
heart
but
he
did
not
speak
then
letting
his
arms
fall
taking
her
hand
in
his
he
laid
it
on
his
forehead
reverently
and
said
in
a
voice
which
was
so
husky
and
trembling
she
could
barely
understand
his
words
my
senorita
knows
that
my
life
is
hers
she
can
ask
me
to
go
into
the
fire
or
into
the
sea
and
neither
the
fire
nor
the
sea
would
frighten
me
they
would
but
make
me
glad
for
her
sake
but
i
can
not
take
my
senorita
life
to
throw
it
away
she
is
tender
she
would
die
she
can
not
lie
on
the
earth
for
a
bed
and
have
no
food
to
eat
my
senorita
does
not
know
what
she
his
solemn
tone
this
designation
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
her
not
with
her
almost
as
if
he
were
thinking
aloud
to
god
rather
than
speaking
to
her
merely
calmed
and
strengthened
did
not
deter
ramona
i
am
strong
i
can
work
too
alessandro
you
do
not
know
we
can
both
work
i
am
not
afraid
to
lie
on
the
earth
and
god
will
give
us
food
she
said
that
was
what
i
thought
my
senorita
until
now
when
i
rode
away
that
morning
i
had
it
in
my
thoughts
as
you
say
that
if
you
were
not
afraid
i
would
not
be
and
that
there
would
at
least
always
be
food
and
i
could
make
it
that
you
should
never
suffer
but
senorita
the
saints
are
displeased
they
do
not
pray
for
us
any
more
it
is
as
my
father
said
they
have
forsaken
us
these
americans
will
destroy
us
all
i
do
not
know
but
they
will
presently
begin
to
shoot
us
and
poison
us
to
get
us
all
out
of
the
country
as
they
do
the
rabbits
and
the
gophers
it
would
not
be
any
worse
than
what
they
have
done
would
not
you
rather
be
dead
senorita
than
be
as
i
am
each
word
he
spoke
but
intensified
ramona
determination
to
share
his
lot
alessandro
she
interrupted
there
are
many
men
among
your
people
who
have
wives
are
there
not
yes
senorita
replied
alessandro
wonderingly
have
their
wives
left
them
and
gone
away
now
that
this
trouble
has
come
no
still
more
wonderingly
how
could
they
they
are
going
to
stay
with
them
help
them
to
earn
money
try
to
make
them
happier
are
they
not
yes
alessandro
began
to
see
whither
these
questions
tended
it
was
not
unlike
the
senora
tactics
the
way
in
which
ramona
narrowed
in
her
lines
of
interrogation
do
the
women
of
your
people
love
their
husbands
very
much
very
much
a
pause
it
was
very
dark
now
alessandro
could
not
see
the
hot
currents
running
swift
and
red
over
ramona
face
even
her
neck
changed
color
as
she
asked
her
last
question
do
you
think
any
one
of
them
loves
her
husband
more
than
i
love
you
alessandro
alessandro
arms
were
again
around
her
before
the
words
were
done
were
not
such
words
enough
to
make
a
dead
man
live
almost
but
not
enough
to
make
such
a
love
as
alessandro
selfish
alessandro
was
silent
you
know
there
is
not
one
said
ramona
impetuously
oh
it
is
too
much
cried
alessandro
throwing
his
arms
up
wildly
then
drawing
her
to
him
again
he
said
the
words
pouring
out
breathless
my
senorita
you
take
me
to
the
door
of
heaven
but
i
dare
not
go
in
i
know
it
would
kill
you
senorita
to
live
the
life
we
must
live
let
me
go
dearest
senorita
let
me
go
it
had
been
better
if
you
had
never
seen
do
you
know
what
i
was
going
to
do
alessandro
if
you
had
not
come
said
ramona
i
was
going
to
run
away
from
the
senora
house
all
alone
and
walk
all
the
way
to
santa
barbara
to
father
salvierderra
and
ask
him
to
put
me
in
the
convent
at
san
juan
bautista
and
that
is
what
i
will
do
now
if
you
leave
me
oh
no
no
senorita
my
senorita
you
will
not
do
that
my
beautiful
senorita
in
the
convent
no
no
cried
alessandro
greatly
agitated
yes
if
you
do
not
let
me
come
with
you
i
shall
do
it
i
shall
set
out
her
words
carried
conviction
to
alessandro
soul
he
knew
she
would
do
as
she
said
even
that
would
not
be
so
dreadful
as
to
be
hunted
like
a
wild
beast
senorita
as
you
may
be
if
you
come
with
when
i
thought
you
were
dead
alessandro
i
did
not
think
the
convent
would
be
dreadful
at
all
i
thought
it
would
be
peace
and
i
could
do
good
teaching
the
children
but
if
i
knew
you
were
alive
i
could
never
have
peace
not
for
one
minute
have
peace
alessandro
i
would
rather
die
than
not
be
where
you
are
oh
alessandro
take
me
with
you
alessandro
was
conquered
i
will
take
you
my
most
beloved
senorita
he
said
gravely
no
lover
gladness
in
his
tone
and
his
voice
was
hollow
i
will
take
you
perhaps
the
saints
will
have
mercy
on
you
even
if
they
have
forsaken
me
and
my
people
your
people
are
my
people
dearest
and
the
saints
never
forsake
any
one
who
does
not
forsake
them
you
will
be
glad
all
our
lives
long
alessandro
cried
ramona
and
she
laid
her
head
on
his
breast
in
solemn
silence
for
a
moment
as
if
registering
a
vow
well
might
felipe
have
said
that
he
would
hold
himself
fortunate
if
any
woman
ever
loved
him
as
ramona
loved
alessandro
when
she
lifted
her
head
she
said
timidly
now
that
she
was
sure
then
you
will
take
your
ramona
with
you
alessandro
i
will
take
you
with
me
till
i
die
and
may
the
madonna
guard
you
my
ramona
replied
alessandro
clasping
her
to
his
breast
and
bowing
his
head
upon
hers
but
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
they
were
not
tears
of
joy
and
in
his
heart
he
said
as
in
his
rapturous
delight
when
he
first
saw
ramona
bending
over
the
brook
under
the
willows
he
had
said
aloud
my
god
what
shall
i
do
it
was
not
easy
to
decide
on
the
best
plan
of
procedure
now
alessandro
wished
to
go
boldly
to
the
house
see
senor
felipe
and
if
need
be
the
senora
ramona
quivered
with
terror
at
the
bare
mention
of
it
you
do
not
know
the
senora
alessandro
she
cried
or
you
would
never
think
of
it
she
has
been
terrible
all
this
time
she
hates
me
so
that
she
would
kill
me
if
she
dared
she
pretends
that
she
will
do
nothing
to
prevent
my
going
away
but
i
believe
at
the
last
minute
she
would
throw
me
in
the
well
in
the
rather
than
have
me
go
with
i
would
never
let
her
harm
you
said
alessandro
neither
would
senor
she
turns
felipe
round
her
finger
as
if
he
were
soft
wax
answered
ramona
she
makes
him
of
a
hundred
minds
in
a
minute
and
he
ca
help
himself
oh
i
think
she
is
in
league
with
the
fiends
alessandro
dare
to
come
near
the
house
i
will
come
here
as
soon
as
every
one
is
asleep
we
must
go
at
ramona
terrors
overruled
alessandro
judgment
and
he
consented
to
wait
for
her
at
the
spot
where
they
now
stood
she
turned
back
twice
to
embrace
him
again
oh
my
alessandro
promise
me
that
you
will
not
stir
from
this
place
till
i
come
she
said
i
will
be
here
when
you
come
he
said
it
will
not
be
more
than
two
hours
she
said
or
three
at
the
utmost
it
must
be
nine
she
did
not
observe
that
alessandro
had
evaded
the
promise
not
to
leave
the
spot
that
promise
alessandro
would
not
have
given
he
had
something
to
do
in
preparation
for
this
unexpected
flight
of
ramona
in
her
innocence
her
absorption
in
her
thoughts
of
alessandro
and
of
love
she
had
never
seemed
to
consider
how
she
would
make
this
long
journey
as
alessandro
had
ridden
towards
temecula
eighteen
days
ago
he
had
pictured
himself
riding
back
on
his
fleet
strong
benito
and
bringing
antonio
matchless
little
dun
mare
for
ramona
to
ride
only
eighteen
short
days
ago
and
as
he
was
dreaming
that
very
dream
he
had
looked
up
and
seen
antonio
on
the
little
dun
mare
galloping
towards
him
like
the
wind
the
overridden
creature
breath
coming
from
her
like
pants
of
a
and
her
sides
dripping
blood
where
antonio
who
loved
her
had
not
spared
the
cruel
spurs
and
antonio
seeing
him
had
uttered
a
cry
and
flinging
himself
off
came
with
a
bound
to
his
side
and
with
gasps
between
his
words
told
him
alessandro
could
not
remember
the
words
only
that
after
them
he
set
his
teeth
and
dropping
the
bridle
laid
his
head
down
between
benito
ears
and
whispered
to
him
and
benito
never
stopped
but
galloped
on
all
that
day
till
he
came
into
temecula
and
there
alessandro
saw
the
roofless
houses
and
the
wagons
being
loaded
and
the
people
running
about
the
women
and
children
wailing
and
then
they
showed
him
the
place
where
his
father
lay
on
the
ground
under
the
tule
and
jumping
off
benito
he
let
him
go
and
that
was
the
last
he
ever
saw
of
him
only
eighteen
days
ago
and
now
here
he
was
under
the
willows
the
same
copse
where
he
first
halted
at
his
first
sight
of
ramona
and
it
was
night
dark
night
and
ramona
had
been
there
in
his
arms
she
was
his
and
she
was
going
back
presently
to
go
away
with
him
where
he
had
no
home
in
the
wide
world
to
which
to
take
her
and
this
poor
beast
he
had
ridden
from
temecula
had
it
strength
enough
left
to
carry
her
alessandro
doubted
he
had
himself
walked
more
than
half
the
distance
to
spare
the
creature
and
yet
there
had
been
good
pasture
all
the
way
but
the
animal
had
been
too
long
starved
to
recover
quickly
in
the
pachanga
canon
where
they
had
found
refuge
the
grass
was
burned
up
by
the
sun
and
the
few
horses
taken
over
there
had
suffered
wretchedly
some
had
died
but
alessandro
even
while
his
arms
were
around
ramona
had
revolved
in
his
mind
a
project
he
would
not
have
dared
to
confide
to
her
if
baba
ramona
own
horse
was
still
in
the
corral
alessandro
could
without
difficulty
lure
him
out
he
thought
it
would
be
no
sin
at
any
rate
if
it
were
it
could
not
be
avoided
the
senorita
must
have
a
horse
and
baba
had
always
been
her
own
had
followed
her
about
like
a
dog
ever
since
he
could
run
in
fact
the
only
taming
he
had
ever
had
had
been
done
by
ramona
with
bread
and
honey
he
was
intractable
to
others
but
ramona
could
guide
him
by
a
wisp
of
his
silky
mane
alessandro
also
had
nearly
as
complete
control
over
him
for
it
had
been
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
during
the
summer
when
he
could
not
see
ramona
to
caress
and
fondle
her
horse
till
baba
knew
and
loved
him
next
to
his
young
mistress
if
only
baba
were
in
the
corral
all
would
be
well
as
soon
as
the
sound
of
ramona
footsteps
had
died
away
alessandro
followed
with
quick
but
stealthy
steps
keeping
well
down
in
the
bottom
below
the
willows
he
skirted
the
terrace
where
the
and
the
sheepfolds
lay
and
then
turned
up
to
approach
the
corral
from
the
farther
side
there
was
no
light
in
any
of
the
herdsmen
huts
they
were
all
asleep
that
was
good
well
alessandro
knew
how
sound
they
slept
many
a
night
while
he
slept
there
with
them
he
had
walked
twice
over
their
bodies
as
they
lay
stretched
on
skins
on
the
floor
out
and
in
without
rousing
them
if
only
baba
would
not
give
a
loud
whinny
leaning
on
the
alessandro
gave
a
low
hardly
audible
whistle
the
horses
were
all
in
a
group
together
at
the
farther
end
of
the
corral
at
the
sound
there
was
a
slight
movement
in
the
group
and
one
of
them
turned
and
came
a
pace
or
two
toward
alessandro
i
believe
that
is
baba
himself
thought
alessandro
and
he
made
another
low
sound
the
horse
quickened
his
steps
then
halted
as
if
he
suspected
some
mischief
baba
whispered
alessandro
the
horse
knew
his
name
as
well
as
any
dog
knew
alessandro
voice
too
but
the
sagacious
creature
seemed
instinctively
to
know
that
here
was
an
occasion
for
secrecy
and
caution
if
alessandro
whispered
he
baba
would
whisper
back
and
it
was
little
more
than
a
whispered
whinny
which
he
gave
as
he
trotted
quickly
to
the
fence
and
put
his
nose
to
alessandro
face
rubbing
and
kissing
and
giving
soft
whinnying
sighs
hush
hush
baba
whispered
alessandro
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
human
being
hush
and
he
proceeded
cautiously
to
lift
off
the
upper
rails
and
bushes
of
the
fence
the
horse
understood
instantly
and
as
soon
as
the
fence
was
a
little
lowered
leaped
over
it
and
stood
still
by
alessandro
side
while
he
replaced
the
rails
smiling
to
himself
spite
of
his
grave
anxiety
to
think
of
juan
can
wonder
in
the
morning
as
to
how
baba
had
managed
to
get
out
of
the
corral
this
had
taken
only
a
few
moments
it
was
better
luck
than
alessandro
had
hoped
for
emboldened
by
it
he
began
to
wonder
if
he
could
not
get
the
saddle
too
the
saddles
harnesses
bridles
and
all
such
things
hung
on
pegs
in
an
open
barn
such
as
is
constantly
to
be
seen
in
southern
california
as
significant
a
testimony
in
matter
of
climate
as
any
signal
service
report
could
be
a
floor
and
a
roof
no
walls
only
corner
posts
to
hold
the
roof
nothing
but
summerhouses
on
a
large
scale
are
the
south
california
barns
alessandro
stood
musing
the
longer
he
thought
the
greater
grew
his
desire
for
that
saddle
baba
if
only
you
knew
what
i
wanted
of
you
you
lie
down
on
the
ground
here
and
wait
while
i
got
the
saddle
but
i
dare
not
risk
leaving
you
come
baba
and
he
struck
down
the
hill
again
the
horse
following
him
softly
when
he
got
down
below
the
terrace
he
broke
into
a
run
with
his
hand
in
baba
mane
as
if
it
were
a
frolic
and
in
a
few
moments
they
were
safe
in
the
willow
copse
where
alessandro
poor
pony
was
tethered
fastening
baba
with
the
same
lariat
alessandro
patted
him
on
the
neck
pressed
his
face
to
his
nose
and
said
aloud
good
baba
stay
here
till
the
senorita
baba
whinnied
why
should
he
know
the
senorita
name
i
believe
he
does
thought
alessandro
as
he
turned
and
again
ran
swiftly
back
to
the
corral
he
felt
strong
now
felt
like
a
new
man
spite
of
all
the
terror
joy
thrilled
him
when
he
reached
the
corral
all
was
yet
still
the
horses
had
not
moved
from
their
former
position
throwing
himself
flat
on
the
ground
alessandro
crept
on
his
breast
from
the
corral
to
the
barn
several
rods
distance
this
was
the
most
hazardous
part
of
his
adventure
every
other
moment
he
paused
lay
motionless
for
some
seconds
then
crept
a
few
paces
more
as
he
neared
the
corner
where
ramona
saddle
always
hung
his
heart
beat
sometimes
of
a
warm
night
luigo
slept
on
the
barn
floor
if
he
were
there
all
was
lost
groping
in
the
darkness
alessandro
pulled
himself
up
on
the
post
felt
for
the
saddle
found
it
lifted
it
and
in
a
trice
was
flat
on
the
ground
again
drawing
the
saddle
along
after
him
not
a
sound
had
he
made
that
the
most
watchful
of
could
hear
ha
old
capitan
caught
you
napping
this
time
said
alessandro
to
himself
as
at
last
he
got
safe
to
the
bottom
of
the
terrace
and
springing
to
his
feet
bounded
away
with
the
saddle
on
his
shoulders
it
was
a
weight
for
a
starving
man
to
carry
but
he
felt
it
not
for
the
rejoicing
he
had
in
its
possession
now
his
senorita
would
go
in
comfort
to
ride
baba
was
to
be
rocked
in
a
cradle
if
need
be
baba
would
carry
them
both
and
never
know
it
and
it
might
come
to
that
alessandro
thought
as
he
knelt
by
the
side
of
his
poor
beast
which
was
stretched
out
on
the
ground
exhausted
baba
standing
by
looking
down
in
scornful
wonder
at
this
strange
new
associate
the
saints
be
praised
thought
alessandro
as
he
seated
himself
to
wait
this
looks
as
if
they
would
not
desert
my
thoughts
whirled
in
his
brain
where
should
they
go
first
what
would
be
best
would
they
be
pursued
where
could
they
hide
where
should
he
seek
a
new
home
it
was
bootless
thinking
until
ramona
was
by
his
side
he
must
lay
each
plan
before
her
she
must
decide
the
first
thing
was
to
get
to
san
diego
to
the
priest
to
be
married
that
would
be
three
days
hard
ride
five
for
the
exhausted
indian
pony
what
should
they
eat
on
the
ways
ah
alessandro
bethought
him
of
the
violin
at
hartsel
hartsel
would
give
him
money
on
that
perhaps
buy
it
then
alessandro
remembered
his
own
violin
he
had
not
once
thought
of
it
before
it
lay
in
its
case
on
a
table
in
senor
felipe
room
when
he
came
away
was
it
possible
no
of
course
it
could
not
be
possible
that
the
senorita
would
think
to
bring
it
what
would
she
bring
she
would
be
wise
alessandro
was
sure
how
long
the
hours
seemed
as
he
sat
thus
plotting
and
conjecturing
more
and
more
thankful
as
each
hour
went
by
to
see
the
sky
still
clouded
the
darkness
dense
it
must
have
been
the
saints
too
that
brought
me
on
a
night
when
there
was
no
moon
he
thought
and
then
he
said
again
devout
and
man
that
he
was
they
mean
to
protect
my
senorita
they
will
let
me
take
care
of
ramona
was
threading
a
perilous
way
through
great
difficulties
she
had
reached
her
room
unobserved
so
far
as
she
could
judge
luckily
for
her
margarita
was
in
bed
with
a
terrible
toothache
for
which
her
mother
had
given
her
a
strong
margarita
was
disposed
of
if
she
had
not
been
ramona
would
never
have
got
away
for
margarita
would
have
known
that
she
had
been
out
of
the
house
for
two
hours
and
would
have
watched
to
see
what
it
meant
ramona
came
in
through
the
she
dared
not
go
by
the
veranda
sure
that
felipe
and
his
mother
were
sitting
there
still
for
it
was
not
late
as
she
entered
her
room
she
heard
them
talking
she
closed
one
of
her
windows
to
let
them
know
she
was
there
then
she
knelt
at
the
feet
and
in
an
inaudible
whisper
told
her
all
she
was
going
to
do
and
prayed
that
she
would
watch
over
her
and
alessandro
and
show
them
where
to
go
i
know
she
will
i
am
sure
she
will
whispered
ramona
to
herself
as
she
rose
from
her
knees
then
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
to
wait
till
the
senora
and
felipe
should
be
asleep
her
brain
was
alert
clear
she
knew
exactly
what
she
wished
to
do
she
had
thought
that
all
out
more
than
two
weeks
ago
when
she
was
looking
for
alessandro
hour
by
hour
early
in
the
summer
alessandro
had
given
to
her
as
curiosities
two
of
the
large
nets
which
the
indian
women
use
for
carrying
all
sorts
of
burdens
they
are
woven
out
of
the
fibres
of
a
plant
and
are
strong
as
iron
the
meshes
being
large
they
are
very
light
are
gathered
at
each
end
and
fastened
to
a
band
which
goes
around
the
forehead
in
these
can
be
carried
on
the
back
with
comparative
ease
heavier
loads
than
could
be
lifted
in
any
other
way
until
ramona
recollected
these
she
had
been
perplexed
to
know
how
she
should
carry
the
things
which
she
had
made
up
her
mind
it
would
be
right
for
her
to
take
only
a
few
simply
necessaries
one
stuff
gown
and
her
shawls
the
new
and
two
changes
of
clothes
that
would
not
be
a
great
deal
she
had
a
right
to
so
much
she
thought
now
that
she
had
seen
the
jewels
in
the
senora
keeping
i
will
tell
father
salvierderra
exactly
what
i
took
she
thought
and
ask
him
if
it
was
too
she
did
not
like
to
think
that
all
these
clothes
she
must
take
had
been
paid
for
with
the
senora
moreno
money
and
alessandro
violin
whatever
else
she
left
that
must
go
what
would
life
be
to
alessandro
without
a
violin
and
if
they
went
to
los
angeles
he
might
earn
money
by
playing
at
dances
already
ramona
had
devised
several
ways
by
which
they
could
both
earn
money
there
must
be
also
food
for
the
journey
and
it
must
be
good
food
too
wine
for
alessandro
anguish
filled
her
heart
as
she
recalled
how
gaunt
he
looked
starving
he
said
they
had
been
good
god
starving
and
she
had
sat
down
each
day
at
loaded
tables
and
seen
each
day
good
food
thrown
to
the
dogs
to
eat
it
was
long
before
the
senora
went
to
her
room
and
long
after
that
before
felipe
breathing
had
become
so
deep
and
regular
that
ramona
dared
feel
sure
that
he
was
asleep
at
last
she
ventured
out
all
was
dark
it
was
past
midnight
the
violin
first
she
said
and
creeping
into
the
and
through
the
inner
door
to
felipe
room
she
brought
it
out
rolled
it
in
shawl
after
shawl
and
put
it
in
the
net
with
her
clothes
then
she
stole
out
with
this
net
on
her
back
like
a
true
indian
woman
as
i
am
she
said
almost
gayly
to
herself
through
the
around
the
southeast
corner
of
the
house
past
the
garden
down
to
the
willows
where
she
laid
down
her
load
and
went
back
for
the
second
this
was
harder
wine
she
was
resolved
to
have
and
bread
and
cold
meat
she
did
not
know
so
well
where
to
put
her
hand
on
old
possessions
as
on
her
own
and
she
dared
not
strike
a
light
she
made
several
journeys
to
the
kitchen
and
pantry
before
she
had
completed
her
store
wine
luckily
she
found
in
the
two
full
bottles
also
milk
which
she
poured
into
a
leathern
flask
which
hung
on
the
wall
in
the
veranda
now
all
was
ready
she
leaned
from
her
window
and
listened
to
breathing
how
can
i
go
without
bidding
him
she
said
how
can
i
and
she
stood
irresolute
dear
felipe
dear
felipe
he
has
always
been
so
good
to
me
he
has
done
all
he
could
for
me
i
wish
i
dared
kiss
him
i
will
leave
a
note
for
taking
a
pencil
and
paper
and
a
tiny
wax
taper
whose
light
would
hardly
be
seen
across
a
room
she
slipped
once
more
into
the
knelt
on
the
floor
behind
the
door
lighted
her
taper
and
wrote
dear
felipe
alessandro
has
come
and
i
am
going
away
with
him
do
let
anything
be
done
to
us
if
you
can
help
it
i
know
where
we
are
going
i
hope
to
father
salvierderra
i
shall
love
you
always
thank
you
dear
felipe
for
all
your
kindness
it
had
not
taken
a
moment
she
blew
out
her
taper
and
crept
back
into
her
room
felipe
bed
was
now
moved
close
to
the
wall
of
the
house
from
her
window
she
could
reach
its
foot
slowly
cautiously
she
stretched
out
her
arm
and
dropped
the
little
paper
on
the
coverlet
just
over
felipe
feet
there
was
a
risk
that
the
senora
would
come
out
in
the
morning
before
felipe
awaked
and
see
the
note
first
but
that
risk
she
would
take
farewell
dear
felipe
she
whispered
under
her
breath
as
she
turned
from
the
window
the
delay
had
cost
her
dear
the
watchful
capitan
from
his
bed
at
the
upper
end
of
the
court
had
half
heard
half
scented
something
strange
going
on
as
ramona
stepped
out
he
gave
one
short
quick
bark
and
came
bounding
down
holy
virgin
i
am
lost
thought
ramona
but
crouching
on
the
ground
she
quickly
opened
her
net
and
as
capitan
came
towards
her
gave
him
a
piece
of
meat
fondling
and
caressing
him
while
he
ate
it
wagging
his
tail
and
making
great
demonstrations
of
joy
she
picked
up
her
load
again
and
still
fondling
him
said
come
on
capitan
it
was
her
last
chance
if
he
barked
again
somebody
would
be
waked
if
he
went
by
her
side
quietly
she
might
escape
a
cold
sweat
of
terror
burst
on
her
forehead
as
she
took
her
first
step
cautiously
the
dog
followed
she
quickened
her
pace
he
trotted
along
still
smelling
the
meat
in
the
net
when
she
reached
the
willows
she
halted
debating
whether
she
should
give
him
a
large
piece
of
meat
and
try
to
run
away
while
he
was
eating
it
or
whether
she
should
let
him
go
quietly
along
she
decided
on
the
latter
course
and
picking
up
her
other
net
walked
on
she
was
safe
now
she
turned
and
looked
back
towards
the
house
all
was
dark
and
still
she
could
hardly
see
its
outline
a
great
wave
of
emotion
swept
over
her
it
was
the
only
home
she
had
ever
known
all
she
had
experienced
of
happiness
as
well
as
of
bitter
pain
had
been
there
felipe
father
salvierderra
the
servants
the
birds
the
garden
the
dear
chapel
ah
if
she
could
have
once
more
prayed
in
the
chapel
who
would
put
fresh
flowers
and
ferns
in
the
chapel
now
how
felipe
would
miss
her
when
he
knelt
before
the
altar
for
fourteen
years
she
had
knelt
by
his
side
and
the
senora
the
hard
cold
senora
she
would
alone
be
glad
everybody
else
would
be
sorry
they
will
all
be
sorry
i
have
gone
all
but
the
senora
i
wish
it
had
been
so
that
i
could
have
bidden
them
all
and
had
them
all
bid
me
and
wish
us
good
fortune
thought
the
gentle
loving
girl
as
she
drew
a
long
sigh
and
turning
her
back
on
her
home
went
forward
in
the
path
she
had
chosen
she
stooped
and
patted
capitan
on
the
head
will
you
come
with
me
capitan
she
said
and
capitan
leaped
up
joyfully
giving
two
or
three
short
sharp
notes
of
delight
good
capitan
come
they
will
not
miss
him
out
of
so
many
she
thought
and
it
will
always
seem
like
something
from
home
as
long
as
i
have
when
alessandro
first
saw
ramona
figure
dimly
in
the
gloom
drawing
slowly
nearer
he
did
not
recognize
it
and
he
was
full
of
apprehension
at
the
sight
what
stranger
could
it
be
abroad
in
these
lonely
meadows
at
this
hour
of
the
night
hastily
he
led
the
horses
farther
back
into
the
copse
and
hid
himself
behind
a
tree
to
watch
in
a
few
moments
more
he
thought
he
recognized
capitan
bounding
by
the
side
of
this
bent
and
figure
yet
this
was
surely
an
indian
woman
toiling
along
under
a
heavy
load
but
what
indian
woman
would
have
so
superb
a
collie
as
capitan
alessandro
strained
his
eyes
through
the
darkness
presently
he
saw
the
figure
halt
drop
part
of
its
burden
alessandro
came
in
a
sweet
low
call
he
bounded
like
a
deer
crying
my
senorita
my
senorita
can
that
be
you
to
think
that
you
have
brought
these
heavy
loads
ramona
laughed
do
you
remember
the
day
you
showed
me
how
the
indian
women
carried
so
much
on
their
backs
in
these
nets
i
did
not
think
then
i
would
use
it
so
soon
but
it
hurts
my
forehead
alessandro
it
is
the
weight
but
the
strings
cut
i
could
have
carried
them
much
farther
ah
you
had
no
basket
to
cover
the
head
replied
alessandro
as
he
threw
up
the
two
nets
on
his
shoulders
as
if
they
had
been
feathers
in
doing
so
he
felt
the
is
it
the
violin
he
cried
my
blessed
one
where
did
you
get
it
off
the
table
in
felipe
room
she
answered
i
knew
you
would
rather
have
it
than
anything
else
i
brought
very
little
alessandro
it
seemed
nothing
while
i
was
getting
it
but
it
is
very
heavy
to
carry
will
it
be
too
much
for
the
poor
tired
horse
you
and
i
can
walk
and
see
alessandro
here
is
capitan
he
waked
up
and
i
had
to
bring
him
to
keep
him
still
ca
he
go
with
us
capitan
was
leaping
up
putting
his
paws
on
alessandro
breast
licking
his
face
yelping
doing
all
a
dog
could
do
to
show
welcome
and
affection
alessandro
laughed
aloud
ramona
had
not
more
than
two
or
three
times
heard
him
do
this
it
frightened
her
why
do
you
laugh
alessandro
she
said
to
think
what
i
have
to
show
you
my
senorita
he
said
look
here
and
turning
towards
the
willows
he
gave
two
or
three
low
whistles
at
the
first
note
of
which
baba
came
trotting
out
of
the
copse
to
the
end
of
his
lariat
and
began
to
snort
and
whinny
with
delight
as
soon
as
he
perceived
ramona
ramona
burst
into
tears
the
surprise
was
too
great
are
you
not
glad
senorita
cried
alessandro
aghast
is
it
not
your
own
horse
if
you
do
not
wish
to
take
him
i
will
lead
him
back
my
pony
can
carry
you
if
we
journey
very
slowly
but
i
thought
it
would
be
joy
to
you
to
have
oh
it
is
it
is
sobbed
ramona
with
her
head
on
baba
neck
it
is
a
miracle
a
miracle
how
did
he
come
here
and
the
saddle
too
she
cried
for
the
first
time
observing
that
alessandro
in
an
whisper
did
the
saints
send
him
did
you
find
him
here
it
would
have
seemed
to
ramona
faith
no
strange
thing
had
this
been
so
i
think
the
saints
helped
me
to
bring
him
answered
alessandro
seriously
or
else
i
had
not
done
it
so
easily
i
did
but
call
near
the
and
he
came
to
my
hand
and
leaped
over
the
rails
at
my
word
as
quickly
as
capitan
might
have
done
he
is
yours
senorita
it
is
no
harm
to
take
him
oh
no
answered
ramona
he
is
more
mine
than
anything
else
i
had
for
it
was
felipe
gave
him
to
me
when
he
could
but
just
stand
on
his
legs
he
was
only
two
days
old
and
i
have
fed
him
out
of
my
hand
every
day
till
now
and
now
he
is
five
dear
baba
we
will
never
be
parted
never
and
she
took
his
head
in
both
her
hands
and
laid
her
cheek
against
it
lovingly
alessandro
was
busy
fastening
the
two
nets
on
either
side
of
the
saddle
baba
will
never
know
he
has
a
load
at
all
they
are
not
so
heavy
as
my
senorita
thought
he
said
it
was
the
weight
on
the
forehead
with
nothing
to
keep
the
strings
from
the
skin
which
gave
her
alessandro
was
making
all
haste
his
hands
trembled
we
must
make
all
the
speed
we
can
dearest
senorita
he
said
for
a
few
hours
then
we
will
rest
before
light
we
will
be
in
a
spot
where
we
can
hide
safely
all
day
we
will
journey
only
by
night
lest
they
pursue
they
will
not
said
ramona
there
is
no
danger
the
senora
said
she
should
do
nothing
she
repeated
in
a
bitter
tone
that
is
what
she
made
felipe
say
too
felipe
wanted
to
help
us
he
would
have
liked
to
have
you
stay
with
us
but
all
he
could
get
was
that
she
would
do
but
they
will
not
follow
us
they
will
wish
never
to
hear
of
me
again
i
mean
the
senora
will
wish
never
to
hear
of
me
felipe
will
be
sorry
felipe
is
very
good
they
were
all
ready
now
ramona
on
baba
the
two
packed
nets
swinging
from
her
saddle
one
on
either
side
alessandro
walking
led
his
tired
pony
it
was
a
sad
sort
of
procession
for
one
going
to
be
wed
but
ramona
heart
was
full
of
joy
i
do
know
why
it
is
alessandro
she
said
i
should
think
i
would
be
afraid
but
i
have
not
the
least
fear
not
the
least
not
of
anything
that
can
come
alessandro
she
reiterated
with
emphasis
is
it
not
strange
yes
senorita
he
replied
solemnly
laying
his
hand
on
hers
as
he
walked
close
at
her
side
it
is
strange
i
am
afraid
afraid
for
you
my
senorita
but
it
is
done
and
we
will
not
go
back
and
perhaps
the
saints
will
help
you
and
will
let
me
take
care
of
you
they
must
love
you
senorita
but
they
do
not
love
me
nor
my
are
you
never
going
to
call
me
by
my
name
asked
ramona
i
hate
your
calling
me
senorita
that
was
what
the
senora
always
called
me
when
she
was
i
will
never
speak
the
word
again
cried
alessandro
the
saints
forbid
i
should
speak
to
you
in
the
words
of
that
woman
ca
you
say
ramona
she
asked
alessandro
hesitated
he
could
not
have
told
why
it
seemed
to
him
difficult
to
say
ramona
what
was
that
other
name
you
said
you
always
thought
of
me
by
she
continued
the
indian
name
the
name
of
the
dove
majel
he
said
it
is
by
that
name
i
have
oftenest
thought
of
you
since
the
night
i
watched
all
night
for
you
after
you
had
kissed
me
and
two
were
calling
and
answering
each
other
in
the
dark
and
i
said
to
myself
that
is
what
my
love
is
like
the
the
voice
is
low
like
hers
and
sweeter
than
any
other
sound
in
the
earth
and
the
is
true
to
one
mate
always
he
stopped
as
i
to
you
alessandro
said
ramona
leaning
from
her
horse
and
resting
her
hand
on
alessandro
shoulder
baba
stopped
he
was
used
to
knowing
by
the
most
trivial
signs
what
his
mistress
wanted
he
did
not
understand
this
new
situation
no
one
had
ever
before
when
ramona
was
riding
him
walked
by
his
side
so
close
that
he
touched
his
shoulders
and
rested
his
hand
in
his
mane
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
than
alessandro
baba
would
not
have
permitted
it
even
now
but
it
must
be
all
right
since
ramona
was
quiet
and
now
she
had
stretched
out
her
hand
and
rested
it
on
alessandro
shoulder
did
that
mean
halt
for
a
moment
baba
thought
it
might
and
acted
accordingly
turning
his
head
round
to
the
right
and
looking
back
to
see
what
came
of
it
alessandro
arms
around
ramona
her
head
bent
down
to
his
their
lips
together
what
could
baba
think
as
mischievously
as
if
he
had
been
a
human
being
or
an
elf
baba
bounded
to
one
side
and
tore
the
lovers
apart
they
both
laughed
and
cantered
on
alessandro
running
the
poor
indian
pony
feeling
the
contagion
and
loping
as
it
had
not
done
for
many
a
day
majel
is
my
name
then
said
ramona
is
it
it
is
a
sweet
sound
but
i
would
like
it
better
majella
call
me
that
will
be
good
replied
alessandro
for
the
reason
that
never
before
had
any
one
the
same
name
it
will
not
be
hard
for
me
to
say
majella
i
know
not
why
your
name
of
ramona
has
always
been
hard
to
my
because
it
was
to
be
that
you
should
call
me
majella
said
ramona
remember
i
am
ramona
no
longer
that
also
was
the
name
the
senora
called
me
by
and
dear
felipe
too
she
added
thoughtfully
he
would
not
know
me
by
my
new
name
i
would
like
to
have
him
always
call
me
ramona
but
for
all
the
rest
of
the
world
i
am
majella
now
alessandro
majel
xvi
after
they
reached
the
highway
and
had
trotted
briskly
on
for
a
mile
alessandro
suddenly
put
out
his
hand
and
taking
baba
by
the
rein
began
turning
him
round
and
round
in
the
road
we
will
not
go
any
farther
in
the
road
he
said
but
i
must
conceal
our
tracks
here
we
will
go
backwards
for
a
few
the
obedient
baba
backed
slowly
half
dancing
as
if
he
understood
the
trick
the
indian
pony
too
curvetted
awkwardly
then
by
a
sudden
bound
under
alessandro
skilful
guidance
leaped
over
a
rock
to
the
right
and
stood
waiting
further
orders
baba
followed
and
capitan
and
there
was
no
trail
to
show
where
they
had
left
the
road
after
trotting
the
pony
round
and
round
again
in
circles
cantering
off
in
one
direction
after
another
then
backing
over
the
tracks
for
a
few
moments
ramona
docilely
following
though
much
bewildered
as
to
what
it
all
meant
alessandro
said
i
think
now
they
will
never
discover
where
we
left
the
road
they
will
ride
along
seeing
our
tracks
plain
and
then
they
will
be
so
sure
that
we
would
have
kept
straight
on
that
they
will
not
notice
for
a
time
and
when
they
do
they
will
never
be
able
to
see
where
the
trail
ended
and
now
my
majella
has
a
very
hard
ride
before
her
will
she
be
afraid
laughed
ramona
afraid
on
baba
and
with
you
but
it
was
indeed
a
hard
ride
alessandro
had
decided
to
hide
for
the
day
in
a
canon
he
knew
from
which
a
narrow
trail
led
direct
to
temecula
a
trail
which
was
known
to
none
but
indians
once
in
this
canon
they
would
be
safe
from
all
possible
pursuit
alessandro
did
not
in
the
least
share
ramona
confidence
that
no
effort
would
be
made
to
overtake
them
to
his
mind
it
appeared
certain
that
the
senora
would
never
accept
the
situation
without
making
an
attempt
to
recover
at
least
the
horse
and
the
dog
she
can
say
if
she
chooses
that
i
have
stolen
one
of
her
horses
he
thought
to
himself
bitterly
and
everybody
would
believe
her
nobody
would
believe
us
if
we
said
it
was
the
own
the
head
of
the
canon
was
only
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
road
but
it
was
in
a
nearly
impenetrable
thicket
of
chaparral
where
young
oaks
had
grown
up
so
high
that
their
tops
made
as
it
were
a
second
stratum
of
thicket
alessandro
had
never
ridden
through
it
he
had
come
up
on
foot
once
from
the
other
side
and
forcing
his
way
through
the
tangle
had
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
was
near
the
highway
it
was
from
this
canon
that
he
had
brought
the
ferns
which
it
had
so
delighted
ramona
to
arrange
for
the
decoration
of
the
chapel
the
place
was
filled
with
them
growing
almost
in
tropical
luxuriance
but
this
was
a
mile
or
so
farther
down
and
to
reach
that
spot
from
above
alessandro
had
had
to
let
himself
down
a
sheer
wall
of
stone
the
canon
at
its
head
was
little
more
than
a
rift
in
the
rocks
and
the
stream
which
had
its
rise
in
it
was
only
a
trickling
spring
at
the
beginning
it
was
this
precious
water
as
well
as
the
inaccessibility
of
the
spot
which
had
decided
alessandro
to
gain
the
place
at
all
hazards
and
costs
but
a
wall
of
granite
would
not
have
seemed
a
much
more
insuperable
obstacle
than
did
this
wall
of
chaparral
along
which
they
rode
vainly
searching
for
a
break
in
it
it
appeared
to
alessandro
to
have
thickened
and
knit
even
since
the
last
spring
at
last
they
made
their
way
down
a
small
side
canon
a
sort
of
wing
to
the
main
canon
a
very
few
rods
down
this
and
they
were
as
hidden
from
view
from
above
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
them
the
first
red
tints
of
the
dawn
were
coming
from
the
eastern
horizon
to
the
zenith
the
whole
sky
was
like
a
dappled
crimson
fleece
oh
what
a
lovely
exclaimed
ramona
i
am
sure
this
was
not
a
hard
ride
at
all
alessandro
is
this
where
we
are
to
stay
alessandro
turned
a
compassionate
look
upon
her
how
little
does
the
know
of
rough
places
he
said
this
is
only
the
beginning
hardly
is
it
even
the
fastening
his
pony
to
a
bush
he
reconnoitred
the
place
disappearing
from
sight
the
moment
he
entered
the
chaparral
in
any
direction
returning
at
last
with
a
grave
face
he
said
will
majella
let
me
leave
her
here
for
a
little
time
there
is
a
way
but
i
can
find
it
only
on
foot
i
will
not
be
gone
long
i
know
it
is
tears
came
into
ramona
eyes
the
only
thing
she
dreaded
was
the
losing
sight
of
alessandro
he
gazed
at
her
anxiously
i
must
go
majella
he
said
with
emphasis
we
are
in
danger
go
go
alessandro
she
cried
but
oh
do
not
be
long
as
he
disappeared
in
the
thicket
the
tough
boughs
crackling
and
snapping
before
him
it
seemed
to
ramona
that
she
was
again
alone
in
the
world
capitan
too
bounded
after
alessandro
and
did
not
return
at
her
call
all
was
still
ramona
laid
her
head
on
baba
neck
the
moments
seemed
hours
at
last
just
as
the
yellow
light
streamed
across
the
sky
and
the
crimson
fleeces
turned
in
one
second
to
gold
she
heard
alessandro
steps
the
next
moment
saw
his
face
it
was
aglow
with
joy
i
have
found
the
trail
he
exclaimed
but
we
must
climb
up
again
out
of
this
and
it
is
too
light
i
like
it
with
fear
and
trembling
they
urged
their
horses
up
and
out
into
the
open
again
and
galloped
a
farther
west
still
keeping
as
close
to
the
chaparral
thicket
as
possible
here
alessandro
who
led
the
way
suddenly
turned
into
the
very
thicket
itself
no
apparent
opening
but
the
boughs
parted
and
closed
and
his
head
appeared
above
them
still
the
little
pony
was
trotting
bravely
along
baba
snorted
with
displeasure
as
he
plunged
into
the
same
bristling
pathway
the
thorny
branches
smote
ramona
cheeks
what
was
worse
they
caught
the
nets
swung
on
baba
sides
presently
these
were
held
fast
and
baba
began
to
rear
and
kick
here
was
a
real
difficulty
alessandro
dismounted
cut
the
strings
and
put
both
the
packages
securely
on
the
back
of
his
own
pony
i
will
walk
he
said
it
was
only
a
little
way
longer
i
would
have
ridden
i
shall
lead
baba
where
it
is
narrow
indeed
it
was
from
sheer
terror
soon
that
ramona
shut
her
eyes
a
path
it
seemed
to
her
only
a
wide
a
stony
crumbling
path
on
the
side
of
a
precipice
down
which
the
stones
rolled
and
rolled
and
rolled
echoing
far
out
of
sight
as
they
passed
at
each
step
the
beasts
took
the
stones
rolled
and
fell
only
the
with
their
sharp
had
made
shift
to
keep
foothold
on
this
precipice
of
these
there
were
thousands
and
their
tall
fifteen
twenty
feet
high
set
thick
with
the
shining
smooth
glistened
like
satin
chalices
in
the
sun
below
hundreds
of
feet
below
lay
the
canon
bottom
a
solid
bed
of
chaparral
looking
soft
and
even
as
a
bed
of
moss
giant
lifted
their
heads
at
intervals
above
this
and
far
out
in
the
plain
glistened
the
loops
of
the
river
whose
sources
unknown
to
the
world
seen
of
but
few
human
eyes
were
to
be
waters
of
comfort
to
these
fugitives
this
day
alessandro
was
cheered
the
trail
was
child
play
to
him
at
the
first
tread
of
baba
dainty
steps
on
the
rolling
stones
he
saw
that
the
horse
was
as
as
an
indian
pony
in
a
few
short
hours
now
they
would
be
all
at
rest
he
knew
where
under
a
there
was
running
water
clear
as
crystal
and
cold
almost
colder
than
one
could
drink
and
green
grass
too
plenty
for
two
days
feed
for
the
horses
or
even
three
and
all
california
might
be
searched
over
in
vain
for
them
once
they
were
down
this
trail
his
heart
full
of
joy
at
these
thoughts
he
turned
to
see
ramona
pallid
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
full
of
terror
he
had
forgotten
that
her
riding
had
hitherto
been
only
on
the
smooth
ways
of
the
valley
and
the
plain
there
she
was
so
fearless
that
he
had
had
no
misgiving
about
her
nerves
here
but
she
had
dropped
the
reins
was
clutching
baba
mane
with
both
hands
and
sitting
unsteadily
in
her
saddle
she
had
been
too
proud
to
cry
out
but
she
was
nearly
beside
herself
with
fright
alessandro
halted
so
suddenly
that
baba
whose
nose
was
nearly
on
his
shoulder
came
to
so
sharp
a
stop
that
ramona
uttered
a
cry
she
thought
he
had
lost
his
footing
alessandro
looked
at
her
in
dismay
to
dismount
on
that
perilous
trail
was
impossible
moreover
to
walk
there
would
take
more
nerve
than
to
ride
yet
she
looked
as
if
she
could
not
much
longer
keep
her
seat
carita
he
cried
i
was
stupid
not
to
have
told
you
how
narrow
the
way
is
but
it
is
safe
i
can
run
in
it
i
ran
all
this
way
with
the
ferns
on
my
back
i
brought
for
oh
did
you
gasped
ramona
diverted
for
the
moment
from
her
contemplation
of
the
abyss
and
more
reassured
by
that
change
of
her
thoughts
than
she
could
have
been
by
anything
else
did
you
it
is
frightful
alessandro
i
never
heard
of
such
a
trail
i
feel
as
if
i
were
on
a
rope
in
the
air
if
i
could
get
down
and
go
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
think
i
would
like
it
better
could
i
i
would
not
dare
to
have
you
get
off
just
here
majella
answered
alessandro
sorrowfully
it
is
dreadful
to
me
to
see
you
suffer
so
i
will
go
very
slowly
indeed
it
is
safe
we
all
came
up
here
the
whole
band
for
the
old
fernando
on
his
horse
all
the
really
said
ramona
taking
comfort
at
each
word
i
will
try
not
to
be
so
silly
is
it
far
dearest
alessandro
not
much
more
as
steep
as
this
dear
nor
so
narrow
but
it
will
be
an
hour
yet
before
we
but
the
worst
was
over
for
ramona
now
and
long
before
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
she
was
ready
to
laugh
at
her
fears
only
as
she
looked
back
at
the
zigzag
lines
of
the
path
over
which
she
had
come
little
more
than
a
brown
thread
they
seemed
flung
along
the
rock
she
shuddered
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
canon
it
was
still
the
dusky
gloaming
when
they
arrived
day
came
late
to
this
fairy
spot
only
at
high
noon
did
the
sun
fairly
shine
in
as
ramona
looked
around
her
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
which
satisfied
alessandro
yes
he
said
when
i
came
here
for
the
ferns
i
wished
to
myself
many
times
that
you
could
see
it
there
is
not
in
all
this
country
so
beautiful
a
place
this
is
our
first
home
my
majella
he
added
in
a
tone
almost
solemn
and
throwing
his
arms
around
her
he
drew
her
to
his
breast
with
the
first
feeling
of
joy
he
had
experienced
i
wish
we
could
live
here
always
cried
ramona
would
majella
be
content
said
alessandro
very
she
answered
he
sighed
there
would
not
be
land
enough
to
live
here
he
said
if
there
were
i
too
would
like
to
stay
here
till
i
died
majella
and
never
see
the
face
of
a
white
man
again
already
the
instinct
of
the
hunted
and
wounded
animal
to
seek
hiding
was
striving
in
blood
but
there
would
be
no
food
we
could
not
live
exclamation
had
set
alessandro
to
thinking
however
would
majella
be
content
to
stay
here
three
days
now
he
asked
there
is
grass
enough
for
the
horses
for
that
time
we
should
be
very
safe
here
and
i
fear
very
much
we
should
not
be
safe
on
any
road
i
think
majella
the
senora
will
send
men
after
baba
cried
ramona
aghast
at
the
idea
my
own
horse
she
would
not
dare
to
call
it
stealing
a
horse
to
take
my
own
baba
but
even
as
she
spoke
her
heart
misgave
her
the
senora
would
dare
anything
would
misrepresent
anything
only
too
well
ramona
knew
what
the
very
mention
of
the
phrase
meant
all
through
the
country
she
looked
piteously
at
alessandro
he
read
her
thoughts
yes
that
is
it
majella
he
said
if
she
sent
men
after
baba
there
is
no
knowing
what
they
might
do
it
would
not
do
any
good
for
you
to
say
he
was
yours
they
would
not
believe
you
and
they
might
take
me
too
if
the
senora
had
told
them
to
and
put
me
into
ventura
she
just
wicked
enough
to
do
it
cried
ramona
let
us
not
stir
out
of
this
spot
alessandro
not
for
a
week
could
we
stay
a
week
by
that
time
she
would
have
given
over
looking
for
i
am
afraid
not
a
week
there
is
not
feed
for
the
horses
and
i
do
not
know
what
we
could
eat
i
have
my
gun
but
there
is
not
much
now
to
but
i
have
brought
meat
and
bread
alessandro
said
ramona
earnestly
and
we
could
eat
very
little
each
day
and
make
it
last
she
was
like
a
child
in
her
simplicity
and
eagerness
every
other
thought
was
for
the
time
being
driven
out
of
her
mind
by
the
terror
of
being
pursued
pursuit
of
her
she
knew
would
not
be
in
the
senora
plan
but
the
reclaiming
of
baba
and
capitan
that
was
another
thing
the
more
ramona
thought
of
it
the
more
it
seemed
to
her
a
form
of
vengeance
which
would
be
likely
to
commend
itself
to
the
senora
mind
felipe
might
possibly
prevent
it
it
was
he
who
had
given
baba
to
her
he
would
feel
that
it
would
be
shameful
to
recall
or
deny
the
gift
only
in
felipe
lay
ramona
hope
if
she
had
thought
to
tell
alessandro
that
in
her
farewell
note
to
felipe
she
had
said
that
she
supposed
they
were
going
to
father
salvierderra
it
would
have
saved
both
her
and
alessandro
much
disquietude
alessandro
would
have
known
that
men
pursuing
them
on
that
supposition
would
have
gone
straight
down
the
river
road
to
the
sea
and
struck
northward
along
the
coast
but
it
did
not
occur
to
ramona
to
mention
this
in
fact
she
hardly
recollected
it
after
the
first
day
alessandro
had
explained
to
her
his
plan
which
was
to
go
by
way
of
temecula
to
san
diego
to
be
married
there
by
father
gaspara
the
priest
of
that
parish
and
then
go
to
the
village
or
pueblo
of
san
pasquale
about
fifteen
miles
northwest
of
san
diego
a
cousin
of
was
the
head
man
of
this
village
and
had
many
times
begged
him
to
come
there
to
live
but
alessandro
had
steadily
refused
believing
it
to
be
his
duty
to
remain
at
temecula
with
his
father
san
pasquale
was
a
regularly
established
pueblo
founded
by
a
number
of
the
indian
neophytes
of
the
san
luis
rey
mission
at
the
time
of
the
breaking
up
of
that
mission
it
was
established
by
a
decree
of
the
governor
of
california
and
the
lands
of
the
san
pasquale
valley
given
to
it
a
paper
recording
this
establishment
and
gift
signed
by
the
own
hand
was
given
to
the
indian
who
was
the
first
alcalde
of
the
pueblo
he
was
chief
pablo
brother
at
his
death
the
authority
passed
into
the
hands
of
his
son
ysidro
the
cousin
of
whom
alessandro
had
spoken
ysidro
has
that
paper
still
alessandro
said
and
he
thinks
it
will
keep
them
their
village
perhaps
it
will
but
the
americans
are
beginning
to
come
in
at
the
head
of
the
valley
and
i
do
not
believe
majella
there
is
any
safety
anywhere
still
for
a
few
years
we
can
perhaps
stay
there
there
are
nearly
two
hundred
indians
in
the
valley
it
is
much
better
than
temecula
and
ysidro
people
are
much
better
off
than
ours
were
they
have
splendid
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
and
large
ysidro
house
stands
under
a
great
they
say
it
is
the
largest
in
the
but
alessandro
cried
ramona
why
do
you
think
it
is
not
safe
there
if
ysidro
has
the
paper
i
thought
a
paper
made
it
all
i
do
know
replied
alessandro
perhaps
it
may
be
but
i
have
got
the
feeling
now
that
nothing
will
be
of
any
use
against
the
americans
i
do
believe
they
will
mind
the
they
did
mind
the
papers
the
senora
had
for
all
that
land
of
hers
they
took
away
said
ramona
thoughtfully
but
felipe
said
that
was
because
pio
pico
was
a
bad
man
and
gave
away
lands
he
had
no
right
to
give
that
just
it
said
alessandro
ca
they
say
that
same
thing
about
any
governor
especially
if
he
has
given
lands
to
us
if
the
senora
could
keep
hers
with
senor
felipe
to
help
her
and
he
knows
all
about
the
law
and
can
speak
the
american
language
what
chance
is
there
for
us
we
ca
take
care
of
ourselves
any
better
than
the
wild
beasts
can
my
majella
oh
why
why
did
you
come
with
me
why
did
i
let
you
after
such
words
as
these
alessandro
would
throw
himself
on
the
ground
and
for
a
few
moments
not
even
ramona
voice
would
make
him
look
up
it
was
strange
that
the
gentle
girl
unused
to
hardship
or
to
the
thought
of
danger
did
not
find
herself
terrified
by
these
fierce
glooms
and
apprehensions
of
her
lover
but
she
was
appalled
by
nothing
saved
from
the
only
thing
in
life
she
had
dreaded
sure
that
alessandro
lived
and
that
he
would
not
leave
her
she
had
no
fears
this
was
partly
from
her
inexperience
from
her
utter
inability
to
conceive
of
the
things
alessandro
imagination
painted
in
colors
only
too
true
but
it
was
also
largely
due
to
the
inalienable
loyalty
and
quenchless
courage
of
her
soul
qualities
in
her
nature
never
yet
tested
qualities
of
which
she
hardly
knew
so
much
as
the
name
but
which
were
to
bear
her
steadfast
and
buoyant
through
many
sorrowful
years
before
nightfall
of
this
their
first
day
in
the
wilderness
alessandro
had
prepared
for
ramona
a
bed
of
finely
broken
twigs
of
the
manzanita
and
ceanothus
both
of
which
grew
in
abundance
all
through
the
canon
above
these
he
spread
layers
of
glossy
ferns
five
and
six
feet
long
when
it
was
done
it
was
a
couch
no
queen
need
have
scorned
as
ramona
seated
herself
on
it
she
exclaimed
now
i
shall
see
how
it
feels
to
lie
and
look
up
at
the
stars
at
night
do
you
recollect
alessandro
the
night
you
put
felipe
bed
on
the
veranda
when
you
told
me
how
beautiful
it
was
to
lie
at
night
out
of
doors
and
look
up
at
the
stars
indeed
did
alessandro
remember
that
night
the
first
moment
he
had
ever
dared
to
dream
of
the
senorita
ramona
as
his
own
yes
i
remember
it
my
majella
he
answered
slowly
and
in
a
moment
more
added
that
was
the
day
juan
can
had
told
me
that
your
mother
was
of
my
people
and
that
was
the
night
i
first
dared
in
my
thoughts
to
say
that
perhaps
you
might
some
day
love
but
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
alessandro
said
ramona
seeing
that
he
spread
no
more
boughs
you
have
made
yourself
no
alessandro
laughed
i
need
no
bed
he
said
we
think
it
is
on
our
mother
lap
we
lie
when
we
lie
on
the
ground
it
is
not
hard
majella
it
is
soft
and
rests
one
better
than
beds
but
i
shall
not
sleep
i
will
sit
by
this
tree
and
why
what
are
you
afraid
of
asked
ramona
it
may
grow
so
cold
that
i
must
make
a
fire
for
majella
he
answered
it
sometimes
gets
very
cold
before
morning
in
these
canons
so
i
shall
feel
safer
to
watch
this
he
said
not
to
alarm
ramona
his
real
reason
for
watching
was
that
he
had
seen
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
tracks
which
gave
him
uneasiness
they
were
faint
and
evidently
old
but
they
looked
like
the
tracks
of
a
mountain
lion
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
enough
to
prevent
the
curl
of
smoke
from
being
seen
from
below
he
would
light
a
fire
and
keep
it
blazing
all
night
and
watch
gun
in
hand
lest
the
beast
return
but
you
will
be
dead
alessandro
if
you
do
not
sleep
you
are
not
strong
said
ramona
anxiously
i
am
strong
now
majella
answered
alessandro
and
indeed
he
did
already
look
like
a
renewed
man
spite
of
all
his
fatigue
and
anxiety
i
am
no
longer
weak
and
i
will
sleep
and
you
shall
will
you
lie
on
the
then
asked
ramona
gleefully
i
would
like
the
ground
better
said
honest
alessandro
ramona
looked
disappointed
that
is
very
strange
she
said
it
is
not
so
soft
this
bed
of
boughs
that
one
need
fear
to
be
made
tender
by
lying
on
it
she
continued
throwing
herself
down
but
oh
how
sweet
how
sweet
it
smells
yes
there
is
in
it
he
answered
i
put
it
in
at
the
head
for
majella
ramona
was
very
tired
and
she
was
happy
all
night
long
she
slept
like
a
child
she
did
not
hear
alessandro
steps
she
did
not
hear
the
crackling
of
the
fire
he
lighted
she
did
not
hear
the
barking
of
capitan
who
more
than
once
spite
of
all
alessandro
could
do
to
quiet
him
made
the
canon
echo
with
sharp
quick
notes
of
warning
as
he
heard
the
stealthy
steps
of
wild
creatures
in
the
chaparral
hour
after
hour
she
slept
on
and
hour
after
hour
alessandro
sat
leaning
against
a
huge
and
watched
her
as
the
fitful
firelight
played
over
her
face
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
it
so
beautiful
its
expression
of
calm
repose
insensibly
soothed
and
strengthened
him
she
looked
like
a
saint
he
thought
perhaps
it
was
as
a
saint
of
help
and
guidance
the
virgin
was
sending
her
to
him
and
his
people
the
darkness
deepened
became
blackness
only
the
red
gleams
from
the
fire
broke
it
in
swaying
rifts
as
the
wind
makes
rifts
in
black
in
the
heavens
with
the
darkness
the
stillness
also
deepened
nothing
broke
that
except
an
occasional
motion
of
baba
or
the
pony
or
an
alert
signal
from
capitan
then
all
seemed
stiller
than
ever
alessandro
felt
as
if
god
himself
were
in
the
canon
countless
times
in
his
life
before
he
had
lain
in
lonely
places
under
the
sky
and
watched
the
night
through
but
he
never
felt
like
this
it
was
ecstasy
and
yet
it
was
pain
what
was
to
come
on
the
morrow
and
the
next
morrow
and
the
next
and
the
next
all
through
the
coming
years
what
was
to
come
to
this
beloved
and
loving
woman
who
lay
there
sleeping
so
confident
so
trustful
guarded
only
by
him
by
him
alessandro
the
exile
fugitive
homeless
man
before
the
dawn
began
their
calling
the
canon
was
full
of
them
no
two
notes
quite
alike
it
seemed
to
alessandro
sharpened
sense
pair
after
pair
he
fancied
that
he
recognized
speaking
and
replying
as
did
the
pair
whose
voices
had
so
comforted
him
the
night
he
watched
under
the
geranium
hedge
by
the
moreno
chapel
love
here
love
here
they
comforted
him
still
more
now
they
too
have
only
each
other
he
thought
as
he
bent
his
eyes
lovingly
on
ramona
face
it
was
dawn
and
past
dawn
on
the
plains
before
it
was
yet
morning
twilight
in
the
canon
but
the
birds
in
the
upper
boughs
of
the
sycamores
caught
the
tokens
of
the
coming
day
and
began
to
twitter
in
the
dusk
their
notes
fell
on
ramona
sleeping
ear
like
the
familiar
sound
of
the
linnets
in
the
at
home
and
waked
her
instantly
sitting
up
bewildered
and
looking
about
her
she
exclaimed
oh
is
it
morning
already
and
so
dark
the
birds
can
see
more
sky
than
we
sing
alessandro
and
she
began
the
hymn
at
dawn
from
the
heavens
above
people
all
regions
gladly
we
too
sing
never
went
up
truer
invocation
from
sweeter
spot
sing
not
so
loud
my
majel
whispered
alessandro
as
her
voice
went
carolling
like
a
lark
in
the
pure
ether
there
might
be
hunters
near
who
would
hear
and
he
joined
in
with
low
and
muffled
tones
as
she
dropped
her
voice
at
this
caution
it
seemed
even
sweeter
than
before
o
sinners
come
and
we
will
sing
tender
hymns
to
our
refuge
ah
majella
there
is
no
sinner
here
except
me
said
alessandro
my
majella
is
like
one
of
the
virgin
own
and
indeed
he
might
have
been
forgiven
the
thought
as
he
gazed
at
ramona
sitting
there
in
the
shimmering
light
her
face
thrown
out
into
relief
by
the
gray
wall
of
rock
behind
her
her
splendid
hair
unbound
falling
in
tangled
masses
to
her
waist
her
cheeks
flushed
her
face
radiant
with
devout
and
fervent
supplication
her
eyes
uplifted
to
the
narrow
belt
of
sky
overhead
where
filmy
vapors
were
turning
to
gold
touched
by
a
sun
she
could
not
see
hush
my
love
she
breathed
rather
than
said
that
would
be
a
sin
if
you
really
thought
it
beautiful
queen
princess
of
heaven
she
continued
repeating
the
first
lines
of
the
song
and
then
sinking
on
her
knees
reached
out
one
hand
for
alessandro
and
glided
almost
without
a
break
in
the
melodious
sound
into
a
low
recitative
of
the
her
rosary
was
of
gold
beads
with
an
ivory
crucifix
a
rare
and
precious
relic
of
the
missions
olden
times
it
had
belonged
to
father
peyri
himself
was
given
by
him
to
father
salvierderra
and
by
father
salvierderra
to
the
blessed
child
ramona
at
her
confirmation
a
warmer
token
of
his
love
and
trust
he
could
not
have
bestowed
upon
her
and
to
ramona
religious
and
affectionate
heart
it
had
always
seemed
a
bond
and
an
assurance
not
only
of
father
salvierderra
love
but
of
the
love
and
protection
of
the
now
sainted
peyri
as
she
pronounced
the
last
words
of
her
trusting
prayer
and
slipped
the
last
of
the
golden
beads
along
on
its
string
a
thread
of
sunlight
shot
into
the
canon
through
a
deep
narrow
gap
in
its
rocky
eastern
crest
shot
in
for
a
second
no
more
fell
aslant
the
rosary
lighted
it
by
a
flash
as
if
of
fire
across
the
facets
of
the
beads
on
ramona
hands
and
on
the
white
face
of
the
ivory
christ
only
a
flash
and
it
was
gone
to
both
ramona
and
alessandro
it
came
like
an
omen
like
a
message
straight
from
the
virgin
could
she
choose
better
messenger
she
the
compassionate
one
the
loving
woman
in
heaven
mother
of
the
christ
to
whom
they
prayed
through
her
mother
for
whose
sake
he
would
regard
their
least
cry
could
she
choose
better
messenger
or
swifter
than
the
sunbeam
to
say
that
she
heard
and
would
help
them
in
these
sore
straits
perhaps
there
were
not
in
the
whole
great
world
at
that
moment
to
be
found
two
souls
who
were
experiencing
so
vivid
a
happiness
as
thrilled
the
veins
of
these
two
friendless
ones
on
their
knees
alone
in
the
wilderness
gazing
half
at
the
shining
rosary
xvii
before
the
end
of
their
second
day
in
the
canon
the
place
had
become
to
ramona
so
like
a
friendly
home
that
she
dreaded
to
leave
its
shelter
nothing
is
stronger
proof
of
the
original
intent
of
nature
to
do
more
for
man
than
the
civilization
in
its
arrogance
will
long
permit
her
to
do
than
the
quick
and
sure
way
in
which
she
reclaims
his
affection
when
by
weariness
idle
chance
or
disaster
he
is
returned
for
an
interval
to
her
arms
how
soon
he
rejects
the
miserable
subterfuges
of
what
he
had
called
habits
sheds
the
still
more
miserable
pretences
of
superiority
makeshifts
of
adornment
and
chains
of
custom
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
has
been
too
long
carelessly
said
it
is
not
true
in
the
sense
in
which
men
use
the
words
whom
the
gods
love
dwell
with
nature
if
they
are
ever
lured
away
return
to
her
before
they
are
old
then
however
long
they
live
before
they
die
they
die
young
whom
the
gods
love
live
young
forever
with
the
insight
of
a
lover
added
to
the
instinct
of
the
indian
alessandro
saw
how
hour
by
hour
there
grew
in
ramona
eyes
the
wonted
look
of
one
at
home
how
she
watched
the
shadows
and
knew
what
they
meant
if
we
lived
here
the
walls
would
be
for
us
would
they
not
she
said
in
a
tone
of
pleasure
i
see
that
yon
tall
yucca
has
gone
in
shadow
sooner
than
it
did
and
what
millions
of
things
grow
here
alessandro
i
did
not
know
there
were
so
many
have
they
all
names
the
nuns
taught
us
some
names
but
they
were
hard
and
i
forgot
them
we
might
name
them
for
ourselves
if
we
lived
here
they
would
be
our
and
for
one
year
i
should
lie
and
look
up
at
the
sky
my
alessandro
and
do
nothing
else
it
hardly
seems
as
if
it
would
be
a
sin
to
do
nothing
for
a
year
if
one
gazed
steadily
at
the
sky
all
the
and
now
i
know
what
it
is
i
have
always
seen
in
your
face
alessandro
it
is
the
look
from
the
sky
one
must
be
always
serious
and
not
unhappy
but
never
too
glad
i
think
when
he
lives
with
nothing
between
him
and
the
sky
and
the
saints
can
see
him
every
and
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
but
two
days
i
have
lived
in
the
air
alessandro
this
seems
to
me
the
first
home
i
have
ever
had
is
it
because
i
am
indian
alessandro
that
it
gives
me
such
joy
it
was
strange
how
many
more
words
ramona
spoke
than
alessandro
yet
how
full
she
felt
their
intercourse
to
be
his
silence
was
more
than
silent
it
was
taciturn
yet
she
always
felt
herself
answered
a
monosyllable
of
alessandro
nay
a
look
told
what
other
men
took
long
sentences
to
say
and
said
less
eloquently
after
long
thinking
over
this
she
exclaimed
you
speak
as
the
trees
speak
and
like
the
rock
yonder
and
the
flowers
without
saying
anything
this
delighted
alessandro
very
heart
and
you
majella
he
exclaimed
when
you
say
that
you
speak
in
the
language
of
our
people
you
are
as
we
and
ramona
in
her
turn
was
made
happy
by
his
words
happier
than
she
would
have
been
made
by
any
other
praise
or
fondness
alessandro
found
himself
regaining
all
his
strength
as
if
by
a
miracle
the
gaunt
look
had
left
his
face
almost
it
seemed
that
its
contour
was
already
fuller
there
is
a
beautiful
old
gaelic
legend
of
a
fairy
who
wooed
a
prince
came
again
and
again
to
him
and
herself
invisible
to
all
but
the
prince
hovered
in
the
air
sang
loving
songs
to
draw
him
away
from
the
crowd
of
his
indignant
nobles
who
heard
her
voice
and
summoned
magicians
to
rout
her
by
all
spells
and
enchantments
at
their
command
finally
they
succeeded
in
silencing
her
and
driving
her
off
but
as
she
vanished
from
the
prince
sight
she
threw
him
an
apple
a
magic
golden
apple
once
having
tasted
of
this
he
refused
all
other
food
day
after
day
night
after
night
he
ate
only
this
golden
apple
and
yet
morning
after
morning
evening
after
evening
there
lay
the
golden
fruit
still
whole
and
shining
as
if
he
had
not
fed
upon
it
and
when
the
fairy
came
the
next
time
the
prince
leaped
into
her
magic
boat
sailed
away
with
her
and
never
was
seen
in
his
kingdom
again
it
was
only
an
allegory
this
legend
a
beautiful
allegory
and
true
of
love
and
lovers
the
food
on
which
alessandro
was
hour
by
hour
now
growing
strong
was
as
magic
and
invisible
as
prince
connla
apple
and
just
as
my
alessandro
how
is
it
you
look
so
well
so
soon
said
ramona
studying
his
countenance
with
loving
care
i
thought
that
night
you
would
die
now
you
look
nearly
strong
as
ever
your
eyes
shine
and
your
hand
is
not
hot
it
is
the
blessed
air
it
has
cured
you
as
it
cured
felipe
of
the
if
the
air
could
keep
me
well
i
had
not
been
ill
majella
replied
alessandro
i
had
been
under
no
roof
except
the
till
i
saw
you
it
is
not
the
air
and
he
looked
at
her
with
a
gaze
that
said
the
rest
at
twilight
of
the
third
day
when
ramona
saw
alessandro
leading
up
baba
saddled
ready
for
the
journey
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
at
noon
alessandro
had
said
to
her
majella
we
must
go
there
is
not
grass
enough
for
another
day
we
must
go
while
the
horses
are
strong
i
dare
not
lead
them
any
farther
down
the
canon
to
graze
for
there
is
a
ranch
only
a
few
miles
lower
i
found
one
of
the
man
cows
feeding
near
ramona
made
no
remonstrance
the
necessity
was
too
evident
but
the
look
on
her
face
gave
alessandro
a
new
pang
he
too
felt
as
if
exiled
afresh
in
leaving
the
spot
and
now
as
he
led
the
horses
slowly
up
and
saw
ramona
sitting
in
a
dejected
attitude
beside
the
nets
in
which
were
again
carefully
packed
their
small
stores
his
heart
ached
anew
again
the
sense
of
his
homeless
and
destitute
condition
settled
like
an
unbearable
burden
on
his
soul
whither
and
to
what
was
he
leading
his
majella
but
once
in
the
saddle
ramona
recovered
cheerfulness
baba
was
in
such
gay
heart
she
could
not
be
wholly
sad
the
horse
seemed
fairly
rollicking
with
satisfaction
at
being
once
more
on
the
move
capitan
too
was
gay
he
had
found
the
canon
dull
spite
of
its
refreshing
shade
and
cool
water
he
longed
for
sheep
he
did
not
understand
this
inactivity
the
puzzled
look
on
his
face
had
made
ramona
laugh
more
than
once
as
he
would
come
and
stand
before
her
wagging
his
tail
and
fixing
his
eyes
intently
on
her
face
as
if
he
said
in
so
many
words
what
in
the
world
are
you
about
in
this
canon
and
do
not
you
ever
intend
to
return
home
or
if
you
will
stay
here
why
not
keep
sheep
do
you
not
see
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
we
must
ride
all
night
majella
said
alessandro
and
lose
no
time
it
is
a
long
way
to
the
place
where
we
shall
stay
is
it
a
canon
asked
ramona
hopefully
no
he
replied
not
a
canon
but
there
are
beautiful
it
is
where
we
get
our
acorns
for
the
winter
it
is
on
the
top
of
a
high
will
it
be
safe
there
she
asked
i
think
so
he
replied
though
not
so
safe
as
here
there
is
no
such
place
as
this
in
all
the
and
then
where
shall
we
go
next
she
asked
that
is
very
near
temecula
he
said
we
must
go
into
temecula
dear
majella
i
must
go
to
hartsel
he
is
friendly
he
will
give
me
money
for
my
father
violin
if
it
were
not
for
that
i
would
never
go
near
the
place
i
would
like
to
see
it
alessandro
she
said
gently
oh
no
no
majella
he
cried
you
would
not
it
is
terrible
the
houses
all
unroofed
all
but
my
father
and
jose
they
were
shingled
roofs
they
will
be
just
the
same
all
the
rest
are
only
walls
antonio
mother
threw
hers
down
i
do
know
how
the
old
woman
ever
had
the
strength
they
said
she
was
like
a
fury
she
said
nobody
should
ever
live
in
those
walls
again
and
she
took
a
pole
and
made
a
great
hole
in
one
side
and
then
she
ran
antonio
wagon
against
it
with
all
her
might
till
it
fell
in
no
majella
it
will
be
would
you
like
to
go
into
the
graveyard
again
alessandro
she
said
timidly
the
saints
forbid
he
said
solemnly
i
think
it
would
make
me
a
murderer
to
stand
in
that
graveyard
if
i
had
not
you
my
majel
i
should
kill
some
white
man
when
i
came
out
oh
do
not
speak
of
it
he
added
after
a
moment
silence
it
takes
the
strength
all
out
of
my
blood
again
majella
it
feels
as
if
i
should
die
and
the
word
temecula
was
not
mentioned
between
them
again
until
dusk
the
next
day
when
as
they
were
riding
slowly
along
between
low
wooded
hills
they
suddenly
came
to
an
opening
a
green
marshy
place
with
a
little
thread
of
trickling
water
at
which
their
horses
stopped
and
drank
thirstily
and
ramona
looking
ahead
saw
lights
twinkling
in
the
distance
lights
alessandro
lights
she
exclaimed
pointing
to
them
yes
majella
he
replied
it
is
temecula
and
springing
off
his
pony
he
came
to
her
side
and
putting
both
his
hands
on
hers
said
i
have
been
thinking
for
a
long
way
back
carita
what
is
to
be
done
here
i
do
not
know
what
does
majella
think
will
be
wise
if
men
have
been
sent
out
to
pursue
us
they
may
be
at
hartsel
his
store
is
the
place
where
everybody
stops
everybody
goes
i
dare
not
have
you
go
there
majella
yet
i
must
go
the
only
way
i
can
get
any
money
is
from
i
must
wait
somewhere
while
you
go
said
ramona
her
heart
beating
as
she
gazed
ahead
into
the
blackness
of
the
great
plain
it
looked
vast
as
the
sea
that
is
the
only
safe
thing
i
think
so
too
he
said
but
oh
i
am
afraid
for
you
and
will
not
you
be
afraid
yes
she
replied
i
am
afraid
but
it
is
not
so
dangerous
as
the
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
me
and
i
could
not
come
back
to
you
majella
if
you
give
baba
his
reins
he
will
take
you
safe
home
he
and
ramona
shrieked
aloud
she
had
not
thought
of
this
possibility
alessandro
had
thought
of
everything
what
could
happen
she
cried
i
mean
if
the
men
were
there
and
if
they
took
me
for
stealing
the
horse
he
said
but
you
would
not
have
the
horse
with
you
she
said
how
could
they
take
you
that
might
make
any
difference
replied
alessandro
they
might
take
me
to
make
me
tell
where
the
horse
oh
alessandro
sobbed
ramona
what
shall
we
do
then
in
another
second
gathering
her
courage
she
exclaimed
alessandro
i
know
what
i
will
do
i
will
stay
in
the
graveyard
no
one
will
come
there
shall
i
not
be
safest
there
holy
virgin
would
my
majel
stay
there
exclaimed
alessandro
why
not
she
said
it
is
not
the
dead
that
will
harm
us
they
would
all
help
us
if
they
could
i
have
no
fear
i
will
wait
there
while
you
go
and
if
you
do
not
come
in
an
hour
i
will
come
to
after
you
if
there
are
men
of
the
senora
there
they
will
know
me
they
will
not
dare
to
touch
me
they
will
know
that
felipe
would
punish
them
i
will
not
be
afraid
and
if
they
are
ordered
to
take
baba
they
can
have
him
we
can
walk
when
the
pony
is
her
confidence
was
contagious
my
has
in
her
breast
the
heart
of
the
lion
said
alessandro
fondly
we
will
do
as
she
says
she
is
wise
and
he
turned
their
horses
heads
in
the
direction
of
the
graveyard
it
was
surrounded
by
a
low
adobe
wall
with
one
small
gate
of
wooden
paling
as
they
reached
it
alessandro
exclaimed
the
thieves
have
taken
the
gate
what
could
they
have
wanted
with
that
said
ramona
to
burn
he
said
doggedly
it
was
wood
but
it
was
very
little
they
might
have
left
the
graves
safe
from
wild
beasts
and
cattle
as
they
entered
the
enclosure
a
dark
figure
rose
from
one
of
the
graves
ramona
started
fear
nothing
whispered
alessandro
it
must
be
one
of
our
people
i
am
glad
now
you
will
not
be
alone
it
is
carmena
i
am
sure
that
was
the
corner
where
they
buried
jose
i
will
speak
to
her
and
leaving
ramona
at
the
gate
he
went
slowly
on
saying
in
a
low
voice
in
the
luiseno
language
carmena
is
that
you
have
no
fear
it
is
i
alessandro
it
was
carmena
the
poor
creature
nearly
crazed
with
grief
was
spending
her
days
by
her
baby
grave
in
pachanga
and
her
nights
by
her
husband
in
temecula
she
dared
not
come
to
temecula
by
day
for
the
americans
were
there
and
she
feared
them
after
a
short
talk
with
her
alessandro
returned
leading
her
along
bringing
her
to
ramona
side
he
laid
her
feverish
hand
in
ramona
and
said
majella
i
have
told
her
all
she
can
not
speak
a
word
of
spanish
but
she
is
very
glad
she
says
that
you
have
come
with
me
and
she
will
stay
close
by
your
side
till
i
come
ramona
tender
heart
ached
with
desire
to
comfort
the
girl
but
all
she
could
do
was
to
press
her
hand
in
silence
even
in
the
darkness
she
could
see
the
hollow
mournful
eyes
and
the
wasted
cheek
words
are
less
needful
to
sorrow
than
to
joy
carmena
felt
in
every
fibre
how
ramona
was
pitying
her
presently
she
made
a
gentle
motion
as
if
to
draw
her
from
the
saddle
ramona
bent
down
and
looked
inquiringly
into
her
face
again
she
drew
her
gently
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
pointed
to
the
corner
from
which
she
had
come
ramona
understood
she
wants
to
show
me
her
husband
grave
she
thought
she
does
not
like
to
be
away
from
it
i
will
go
with
dismounting
and
taking
baba
bridle
over
her
arm
she
bowed
her
head
assentingly
and
still
keeping
firm
hold
of
carmena
hand
followed
her
the
graves
were
thick
and
irregularly
placed
each
mound
marked
by
a
small
wooden
cross
carmena
led
with
the
swift
step
of
one
who
knew
each
inch
of
the
way
by
heart
more
than
once
ramona
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
and
baba
was
impatient
and
restive
at
the
strange
inequalities
under
his
feet
when
they
reached
the
corner
ramona
saw
the
earth
of
the
new
grave
uttering
a
wailing
cry
carmena
drawing
ramona
to
the
edge
of
it
pointing
down
with
her
right
hand
then
laid
both
hands
on
her
heart
and
gazed
at
ramona
piteously
ramona
burst
into
weeping
and
again
clasping
carmena
hand
laid
it
on
her
own
breast
to
show
her
sympathy
carmena
did
not
weep
she
was
long
past
that
and
she
felt
for
the
moment
lifted
out
of
herself
by
the
sweet
sudden
sympathy
of
this
stranger
this
girl
like
herself
yet
so
different
so
wonderful
so
beautiful
carmena
was
sure
she
must
be
had
the
saints
sent
her
from
heaven
to
alessandro
what
did
it
mean
carmena
bosom
was
heaving
with
the
things
she
longed
to
say
and
to
ask
but
all
she
could
do
was
to
press
ramona
hand
again
and
again
and
occasionally
lay
her
soft
cheek
upon
it
now
was
it
not
the
saints
that
put
it
into
my
head
to
come
to
the
graveyard
thought
ramona
what
a
comfort
to
this
poor
thing
to
see
alessandro
and
she
keeps
me
from
all
fear
holy
virgin
but
i
had
died
of
terror
here
all
alone
not
that
the
dead
would
harm
me
but
simply
from
the
vast
silent
plain
and
the
soon
carmena
made
signs
to
ramona
that
they
would
return
to
the
gate
considerate
and
thoughtful
she
remembered
that
alessandro
would
expect
to
find
them
there
but
it
was
a
long
and
weary
watch
they
had
waiting
for
alessandro
to
come
after
leaving
them
and
tethering
his
pony
he
had
struck
off
at
a
quick
run
for
hartsel
which
was
perhaps
an
eighth
of
a
mile
from
the
graveyard
his
own
old
home
lay
a
little
to
the
right
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
a
light
in
its
windows
he
stopped
as
if
shot
a
light
in
our
house
he
exclaimed
and
he
clenched
his
hands
those
cursed
robbers
have
gone
into
it
to
live
already
his
blood
seemed
turning
to
fire
ramona
would
not
have
recognized
the
face
of
her
alessandro
now
it
was
full
of
implacable
vengeance
involuntarily
he
felt
for
his
knife
it
was
gone
his
gun
he
had
left
inside
the
graveyard
leaning
against
the
wall
ah
in
the
graveyard
yes
and
there
also
was
ramona
waiting
for
him
thoughts
of
vengeance
fled
the
world
held
now
but
one
work
one
hope
one
passion
for
him
but
he
would
at
least
see
who
were
these
dwellers
in
his
father
house
a
fierce
desire
to
see
their
faces
burned
within
him
why
should
he
thus
torture
himself
why
indeed
but
he
must
he
would
see
the
new
already
begun
on
the
grave
of
his
stealthily
creeping
under
the
window
from
which
the
light
shone
he
listened
he
heard
children
voices
a
woman
voice
at
intervals
the
voice
of
a
man
gruff
and
surly
various
household
sounds
also
it
was
evidently
the
cautiously
raising
himself
till
his
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
the
lowest
panes
in
the
window
he
looked
in
a
table
was
set
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
there
were
sitting
at
it
a
man
woman
and
two
children
the
youngest
little
more
than
a
baby
sat
in
its
high
chair
drumming
with
a
spoon
on
the
table
impatient
for
its
supper
the
room
was
in
great
confusion
beds
made
on
the
floor
open
boxes
half
unpacked
saddles
and
harness
thrown
down
in
the
corners
evidently
there
were
into
the
house
the
window
was
open
by
an
inch
it
had
warped
and
would
not
shut
down
bitterly
alessandro
recollected
how
he
had
put
off
from
day
to
day
the
planing
of
that
window
to
make
it
shut
tight
now
thanks
to
the
crack
he
could
hear
all
that
was
said
the
woman
looked
weary
and
worn
her
face
was
a
sensitive
one
and
her
voice
kindly
but
the
man
had
the
countenance
of
a
brute
of
a
human
brute
why
do
we
malign
the
brute
creation
making
their
names
a
unit
of
comparison
for
base
traits
which
never
one
of
them
possessed
it
seems
as
if
i
never
should
get
to
rights
in
this
world
said
the
woman
alessandro
understood
enough
english
to
gather
the
meaning
of
what
she
said
he
listened
eagerly
when
will
the
next
wagon
get
here
i
do
know
growled
her
husband
there
been
a
slide
in
that
cursed
canon
and
blocked
the
road
they
wo
be
here
for
several
days
yet
hai
you
got
stuff
enough
round
now
if
you
clear
up
here
now
then
be
time
enough
to
grumble
because
you
had
got
but
john
she
replied
i
ca
clear
up
till
the
bureau
comes
to
put
the
things
away
in
and
the
bedstead
i
ca
seem
to
do
you
can
grumble
i
take
notice
he
answered
that
about
all
you
women
are
good
for
anyhow
there
was
a
bedstead
in
here
if
rothsaker
had
been
such
a
fool
to
let
those
dogs
of
indians
carry
off
all
their
truck
we
might
have
had
that
the
woman
looked
at
him
reproachfully
but
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
her
cheeks
flushed
and
seeming
unable
to
repress
the
speech
she
exclaimed
well
i
thankful
enough
he
did
let
the
poor
things
take
their
furniture
i
never
have
slept
a
wink
an
that
bedstead
i
know
if
it
had
ha
been
left
here
it
bad
enough
to
take
their
houses
this
way
oh
you
shut
up
your
head
for
a
blamed
fool
will
you
cried
the
man
he
was
half
drunk
his
worst
and
most
dangerous
state
she
glanced
at
him
half
timorously
half
indignantly
and
turning
to
the
children
began
feeding
the
baby
at
that
second
the
other
child
looked
up
and
catching
sight
of
the
outline
of
alessandro
head
cried
out
a
man
there
there
at
the
window
alessandro
threw
himself
flat
on
the
ground
and
held
his
breath
had
he
imperilled
all
brought
danger
on
himself
and
ramona
by
yielding
to
this
mad
impulse
to
look
once
more
inside
the
walls
of
his
home
with
a
fearful
oath
the
man
exclaimed
one
of
those
damned
indians
i
expect
i
seen
several
hangin
round
we
have
to
shoot
two
or
three
of
yet
before
we
rid
of
and
he
took
his
gun
down
from
the
pegs
above
the
fireplace
and
went
to
the
door
with
it
in
his
hand
oh
do
fire
father
cried
the
woman
they
come
and
murder
us
all
in
our
sleep
if
you
do
do
fire
and
she
pulled
him
back
by
the
sleeve
shaking
her
off
with
another
oath
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
stood
listening
and
peering
into
the
darkness
alessandro
heart
beat
like
a
hammer
in
his
breast
except
for
the
thought
of
ramona
he
would
have
sprung
on
the
man
seized
his
gun
and
killed
him
i
do
believe
it
was
anybody
after
all
father
persisted
the
woman
bud
always
seein
things
i
do
believe
there
was
anybody
there
come
in
supper
gettin
all
well
i
jest
fire
to
let
know
there
powder
shot
round
here
said
the
fiend
if
it
hits
any
on
roamin
round
he
know
what
hurt
him
and
levelling
his
gun
at
random
with
his
drunken
unsteady
hand
he
fired
the
bullet
whistled
away
harmlessly
into
the
empty
darkness
hearkening
a
few
moments
and
hearing
no
cry
he
hiccuped
him
that
time
and
went
in
to
his
supper
alessandro
did
not
dare
to
stir
for
a
long
time
how
he
cursed
his
own
folly
in
having
brought
himself
into
this
plight
what
needless
pain
of
waiting
he
was
inflicting
on
the
faithful
one
watching
for
him
in
that
desolate
and
fearful
place
of
graves
at
last
he
ventured
sliding
along
on
his
belly
a
few
inches
at
a
time
till
several
rods
from
the
house
he
dared
at
last
to
spring
to
his
feet
and
bound
away
at
full
speed
for
hartsel
hartsel
was
one
of
those
mongrel
establishments
to
be
seen
nowhere
except
in
southern
california
half
shop
half
farm
half
tavern
it
gathered
up
to
itself
all
the
threads
of
the
life
of
the
whole
region
indians
ranchmen
travellers
of
all
sorts
traded
at
hartsel
drank
at
hartsel
slept
at
hartsel
it
was
the
only
place
of
its
kind
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
and
it
was
the
least
bad
place
of
its
kind
within
a
much
wider
radius
hartsel
was
by
no
means
a
bad
fellow
when
he
was
sober
but
as
that
condition
was
not
so
frequent
as
it
should
have
been
he
sometimes
came
near
being
a
very
bad
fellow
indeed
at
such
times
everybody
was
afraid
of
him
wife
children
travellers
ranchmen
and
all
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
occasion
they
said
hartsel
killing
somebody
sooner
or
later
and
it
looked
as
if
the
time
were
drawing
near
fast
but
out
of
his
cups
hartsel
was
kindly
and
fairly
truthful
entertaining
too
to
a
degree
which
held
many
a
wayfarer
chained
to
his
chair
till
small
hours
of
the
morning
listening
to
his
landlord
talk
how
he
had
drifted
from
alsace
to
san
diego
county
he
could
hardly
have
told
in
minute
detail
himself
there
had
been
so
many
stages
and
phases
of
the
strange
journey
but
he
had
come
to
his
last
halt
now
here
in
this
temecula
he
would
lay
his
bones
he
liked
the
country
he
liked
the
wild
life
and
for
a
wonder
he
liked
the
indians
many
a
good
word
he
spoke
for
them
to
travellers
who
believed
no
good
of
the
race
and
evidently
listened
with
polite
incredulity
when
he
would
say
as
he
often
did
i
never
lost
a
dollar
off
these
indians
yet
they
do
all
their
trading
with
me
there
some
of
them
i
trust
as
high
a
hundred
dollars
if
they
ca
pay
this
year
they
pay
next
and
if
they
die
their
relations
will
pay
their
debts
for
them
a
little
at
a
time
till
they
got
it
all
paid
off
they
pay
in
wheat
or
bring
a
steer
maybe
or
baskets
or
mats
the
women
make
but
they
pay
honester
the
general
run
of
mexicans
about
paying
i
mean
mexicans
that
are
as
poor
they
hartsel
was
a
long
low
adobe
building
with
still
lower
flanking
additions
in
which
were
bedrooms
for
travellers
the
kitchen
and
storerooms
the
shop
was
a
separate
building
of
rough
planks
a
story
and
a
half
high
the
loft
of
which
was
one
great
dormitory
well
provided
with
beds
on
the
floor
but
with
no
other
article
of
bedroom
furniture
they
who
slept
in
this
loft
had
no
fastidious
standards
of
personal
luxury
these
two
buildings
with
some
of
one
sort
and
another
stood
in
an
enclosure
surrounded
by
a
low
white
picket
fence
which
gave
to
the
place
a
certain
look
spite
of
the
neglected
condition
of
the
ground
which
was
bare
sand
or
sparsely
tufted
with
weeds
and
wild
grass
a
few
plants
parched
and
straggling
stood
in
pots
and
tin
cans
around
the
door
of
the
one
hardly
knew
whether
they
made
the
place
look
less
desolate
or
more
so
but
they
were
token
of
a
hand
and
of
a
nature
which
craved
something
more
than
the
unredeemed
wilderness
around
her
afforded
a
dull
and
lurid
light
streamed
out
from
the
door
of
the
store
alessandro
drew
cautiously
near
the
place
was
full
of
men
and
he
heard
loud
laughing
and
talking
he
dared
not
go
in
stealing
around
to
the
rear
he
leaped
the
fence
and
went
to
the
other
house
and
opened
the
kitchen
door
here
he
was
not
afraid
hartsel
had
never
any
but
indian
servants
in
her
employ
the
kitchen
was
lighted
only
by
one
dim
candle
on
the
stove
were
sputtering
and
hissing
all
the
pots
and
it
would
hold
much
cooking
was
evidently
going
on
for
the
men
who
were
noisily
rollicking
in
the
other
house
seating
himself
by
the
fire
alessandro
waited
in
a
few
moments
hartsel
came
hurrying
back
to
her
work
it
was
no
uncommon
experience
to
find
an
indian
quietly
sitting
by
her
fire
in
the
dim
light
she
did
not
recognize
alessandro
but
mistook
him
as
he
sat
bowed
over
his
head
in
his
hands
for
old
ramon
who
was
a
sort
of
recognized
of
the
place
earning
his
living
there
by
odd
jobs
of
fetching
and
carrying
and
anything
else
he
could
do
run
ramon
she
said
and
bring
me
more
wood
this
cotton
wood
is
so
dry
it
burns
out
like
rotten
punk
i
off
my
feet
with
all
these
men
to
cook
for
then
turning
to
the
table
she
began
cutting
her
bread
and
did
not
see
how
tall
and
unlike
ramon
was
the
man
who
silently
rose
and
went
out
to
do
her
bidding
when
a
few
moments
later
alessandro
bringing
a
huge
armful
of
wood
which
it
would
have
cost
poor
old
ramon
three
journeys
at
least
to
bring
and
throwing
it
down
on
the
hearth
said
will
that
be
enough
hartsel
she
gave
a
scream
of
surprise
and
dropped
her
knife
why
who
she
began
then
seeing
his
face
her
own
lighting
up
with
pleasure
she
continued
alessandro
is
it
you
why
i
took
you
in
the
dark
for
old
ramon
i
thought
you
were
in
in
pachanga
then
as
yet
no
one
had
come
from
the
senora
moreno
to
hartsel
in
search
of
him
and
the
senorita
ramona
alessandro
heart
felt
almost
light
in
his
bosom
from
the
one
immediate
danger
he
had
dreaded
they
were
safe
but
no
trace
of
emotion
showed
on
his
face
and
he
did
not
raise
his
eyes
as
he
replied
i
have
been
in
pachanga
my
father
is
dead
i
have
buried
him
oh
alessandro
did
he
die
cried
the
kindly
woman
coming
closer
to
alessandro
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
heard
he
was
she
paused
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
had
suffered
so
at
the
time
of
the
ejectment
of
the
indians
that
it
had
made
her
for
two
days
she
had
kept
her
doors
shut
and
her
windows
close
curtained
that
she
need
not
see
the
terrible
sights
she
was
not
a
woman
of
many
words
she
was
a
mexican
but
there
were
those
who
said
that
some
indian
blood
ran
in
her
veins
this
was
not
improbable
and
it
seemed
more
than
ever
probable
now
as
she
stood
still
by
alessandro
side
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
her
eyes
fixed
in
distress
on
his
face
how
he
had
altered
how
well
she
recollected
his
lithe
figure
his
alert
motion
his
superb
bearing
his
handsome
face
when
she
last
saw
him
in
the
spring
you
were
away
all
summer
alessandro
she
said
at
last
turning
back
to
her
work
yes
he
said
at
the
senora
so
i
heard
she
said
that
is
a
fine
great
place
is
it
not
is
her
son
grown
a
fine
man
he
was
a
lad
when
i
saw
him
he
went
through
here
with
a
drove
of
sheep
ay
he
is
a
man
now
said
alessandro
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
again
poor
fellow
i
do
wonder
he
does
not
want
to
speak
thought
hartsel
i
just
let
him
alone
and
she
spoke
no
more
for
some
moments
alessandro
sat
still
by
the
fire
a
strange
apathy
seemed
to
have
seized
him
at
last
he
said
wearily
i
must
be
going
now
i
wanted
to
see
hartsel
a
minute
but
he
seems
to
be
busy
in
the
yes
she
said
a
lot
of
san
francisco
men
they
belong
to
the
company
that
coming
in
here
in
the
valley
they
been
here
two
days
oh
alessandro
she
continued
bethinking
herself
jim
got
your
violin
here
jose
brought
yes
i
know
it
answered
alessandro
jose
told
me
and
that
was
one
thing
i
stopped
i
run
and
get
it
she
exclaimed
no
said
alessandro
in
a
slow
husky
voice
i
do
not
want
it
i
thought
hartsel
might
buy
it
i
want
some
money
it
was
not
mine
it
was
my
father
it
is
a
great
deal
better
than
mine
my
father
said
it
would
bring
a
great
deal
of
money
it
is
very
indeed
it
is
she
replied
one
of
those
men
in
there
was
looking
at
it
last
night
he
was
astonished
at
it
and
he
would
not
believe
jim
when
he
told
him
about
its
having
come
from
the
does
he
play
will
he
buy
it
cried
alessandro
i
do
know
i
call
jim
she
said
and
running
out
she
looked
in
at
the
other
door
saying
jim
jim
alas
jim
was
in
no
condition
to
reply
at
her
first
glance
in
his
face
her
countenance
hardened
into
an
expression
of
disgust
and
defiance
returning
to
the
kitchen
she
said
scornfully
disdaining
all
disguises
jim
drunk
no
use
your
talking
to
him
wait
till
till
morning
a
groan
escaped
from
alessandro
in
spite
of
himself
i
ca
he
cried
i
must
go
on
why
what
for
exclaimed
hartsel
much
astonished
for
one
brief
second
alessandro
revolved
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
confiding
everything
to
her
only
for
a
second
however
no
the
fewer
knew
his
secret
and
ramona
the
better
i
must
be
in
san
diego
he
said
got
work
there
she
said
yes
that
is
in
san
pasquale
he
said
and
i
ought
to
have
been
there
three
days
hartsel
mused
jim
ca
do
anything
she
said
certain
you
might
see
the
man
yourself
and
ask
him
if
he
buy
alessandro
shook
his
head
an
invincible
repugnance
withheld
him
he
could
not
face
one
of
these
americans
who
were
coming
in
to
his
valley
hartsel
understood
i
tell
you
alessandro
said
the
kindly
woman
i
give
you
what
money
you
need
and
then
if
you
say
so
jim
sell
the
violin
if
the
man
wants
it
and
you
can
pay
me
back
out
of
that
and
when
you
along
this
way
again
you
can
have
the
rest
jim
make
as
good
a
trade
for
you
he
can
he
a
real
good
friend
to
all
of
you
alessandro
when
he
i
know
it
hartsel
i
trust
hartsel
more
than
any
other
man
in
this
country
said
alessandro
he
about
the
only
white
man
i
do
trust
hartsel
was
fumbling
in
a
deep
pocket
in
her
after
she
drew
out
humph
got
i
thought
i
had
she
said
i
kept
all
that
been
paid
in
here
for
i
knew
jim
be
drunk
before
alessandro
eyes
fastened
on
the
gold
how
he
longed
for
an
abundance
of
those
little
shining
pieces
for
his
majella
he
sighed
as
hartsel
counted
them
out
on
the
table
one
two
three
four
bright
pieces
that
is
as
much
as
i
dare
take
said
alessandro
when
she
put
down
the
fourth
will
you
trust
me
for
so
much
he
added
sadly
you
know
i
have
nothing
left
now
hartsel
i
am
only
a
beggar
till
i
get
some
work
to
the
tears
came
into
hartsel
eyes
it
a
shame
she
said
a
shame
alessandro
jim
and
i
have
thought
of
anything
else
since
it
happened
jim
says
they
never
prosper
never
trust
you
yes
indeed
jim
and
i
trust
you
or
your
father
the
last
day
of
our
i
glad
he
is
dead
said
alessandro
as
he
knotted
the
gold
into
his
handkerchief
and
put
it
into
his
bosom
but
he
was
murdered
hartsel
murdered
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
fired
a
bullet
into
that
she
exclaimed
vehemently
i
say
so
too
and
so
was
jose
that
just
what
i
said
at
the
time
that
bullets
would
not
be
half
so
inhuman
the
words
had
hardly
left
her
lips
when
the
door
from
the
burst
open
and
a
dozen
men
headed
by
the
drunken
jim
came
stumbling
laughing
reeling
into
the
kitchen
where
supper
give
us
our
supper
what
are
you
about
with
your
indian
here
i
teach
you
how
to
cook
ham
stammered
jim
making
a
lurch
towards
the
stove
the
men
behind
caught
him
and
saved
him
eyeing
the
group
with
scorn
hartsel
who
had
not
a
cowardly
nerve
in
her
body
said
gentlemen
if
you
will
take
your
seats
at
the
table
i
will
bring
in
your
supper
immediately
it
is
all
one
or
two
of
the
soberer
ones
shamed
by
her
tone
led
the
rest
back
into
the
where
seating
themselves
they
began
to
pound
the
table
and
swing
the
chairs
swearing
and
singing
ribald
songs
get
off
as
quick
as
you
can
alessandro
whispered
hartsel
as
she
passed
by
him
standing
like
a
statue
his
eyes
full
of
hatred
and
contempt
fixed
on
the
tipsy
group
you
better
go
there
no
knowing
what
they
do
are
you
not
afraid
he
said
in
a
low
tone
no
she
said
i
used
to
it
i
can
always
manage
jim
and
round
somewhere
he
and
the
if
worse
comes
to
worse
i
can
call
the
dogs
these
san
francisco
fellows
are
always
the
worst
to
get
drunk
but
you
better
get
out
of
the
way
and
these
are
the
men
that
have
stolen
our
lands
and
killed
my
father
and
jose
and
carmena
baby
thought
alessandro
as
he
ran
swiftly
back
towards
the
graveyard
and
father
salvierderra
says
god
is
good
it
must
be
the
saints
no
longer
pray
to
him
for
us
but
alessandro
heart
was
too
full
of
other
thoughts
now
to
dwell
long
on
past
wrongs
however
bitter
the
present
called
him
too
loudly
putting
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
feeling
the
soft
knotted
handkerchief
he
thought
twenty
dollars
it
is
not
much
but
it
will
buy
food
for
many
days
for
my
majella
and
for
baba
xviii
except
for
the
reassuring
help
of
carmena
presence
by
her
side
ramona
would
never
have
had
courage
to
remain
during
this
long
hour
in
the
graveyard
as
it
was
she
twice
resolved
to
bear
the
suspense
no
longer
and
made
a
movement
to
go
the
chance
of
alessandro
encountering
at
hartsel
the
men
sent
in
pursuit
of
him
and
of
baba
loomed
in
her
thoughts
into
a
more
and
more
frightful
danger
each
moment
she
reflected
upon
it
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
suggestion
for
alessandro
to
have
made
her
excited
fancy
went
on
and
on
picturing
the
possible
scenes
which
might
be
going
on
almost
within
of
where
she
was
sitting
helpless
in
the
midnight
darkness
alessandro
seized
tied
treated
as
a
thief
and
she
ramona
not
there
to
vindicate
him
to
terrify
the
men
into
letting
him
go
she
could
not
bear
it
she
would
ride
boldly
to
hartsel
door
but
when
she
made
a
motion
as
if
she
would
go
and
said
in
the
soft
spanish
of
which
carmena
knew
no
word
but
which
yet
somehow
conveyed
ramona
meaning
i
must
go
it
is
too
long
i
can
not
wait
here
carmena
had
clasped
her
hand
tighter
and
said
in
the
san
luiseno
tongue
of
which
ramona
knew
no
word
but
which
yet
somehow
conveyed
carmena
meaning
o
beloved
lady
you
must
not
go
waiting
is
the
only
safe
thing
alessandro
said
to
wait
here
he
will
the
word
alessandro
was
plain
yes
alessandro
had
said
wait
carmena
was
right
she
would
obey
but
it
was
a
fearful
ordeal
it
was
strange
how
ramona
who
felt
herself
preternaturally
brave
afraid
of
nothing
so
long
as
alessandro
was
by
her
side
became
timorous
and
wretched
the
instant
he
was
lost
to
her
sight
when
she
first
heard
his
steps
coming
she
quivered
with
terror
lest
they
might
not
be
his
the
next
second
she
knew
and
with
a
glad
cry
alessandro
alessandro
she
bounded
to
him
dropping
baba
reins
sighing
gently
carmena
picked
up
the
reins
and
stood
still
holding
the
horse
while
the
lovers
clasped
each
other
with
breathless
words
how
she
loves
alessandro
thought
the
widowed
carmena
will
they
leave
him
alive
to
stay
with
her
it
is
better
not
to
love
but
there
was
no
bitter
envy
in
her
mind
for
the
two
who
were
thus
blest
while
she
went
desolate
all
of
pablo
people
had
great
affection
for
alessandro
they
had
looked
forward
to
his
being
over
them
in
his
father
place
they
knew
his
goodness
and
were
proud
of
his
superiority
to
themselves
majella
you
tremble
said
alessandro
as
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
you
have
feared
yet
you
were
not
he
glanced
at
motionless
figure
standing
by
baba
no
not
alone
dear
alessandro
but
it
was
so
long
replied
ramona
and
i
feared
the
men
had
taken
you
as
you
feared
was
there
any
one
there
no
no
one
has
heard
anything
all
was
well
they
thought
i
had
just
come
from
pachanga
he
answered
except
for
carmena
i
should
have
ridden
after
you
half
an
hour
ago
continued
ramona
but
she
told
me
to
she
told
you
repeated
alessandro
how
did
you
understand
her
speech
i
do
not
know
was
it
not
a
strange
thing
replied
ramona
she
spoke
in
your
tongue
but
i
thought
i
understood
her
ask
her
if
she
did
not
say
that
i
must
not
go
that
it
was
safer
to
wait
that
you
had
so
said
and
you
would
soon
alessandro
repeated
the
words
to
carmena
did
you
say
that
he
asked
yes
answered
carmena
you
see
then
she
has
understood
the
luiseno
words
he
said
delightedly
she
is
one
of
yes
said
carmena
gravely
she
is
one
of
then
taking
hand
in
both
of
her
own
for
farewell
she
repeated
in
a
tone
as
of
dire
prophecy
one
of
us
alessandro
one
of
us
and
as
she
gazed
after
their
retreating
forms
almost
immediately
swallowed
and
lost
in
the
darkness
she
repeated
the
words
again
to
herself
one
of
us
one
of
us
sorrow
came
to
me
she
rides
to
meet
it
and
she
crept
back
to
her
husband
grave
and
threw
herself
down
to
watch
till
the
dawn
the
road
which
alessandro
would
naturally
have
taken
would
carry
them
directly
by
hartsel
again
but
wishing
to
avoid
all
risk
of
meeting
or
being
seen
by
any
of
the
men
on
the
place
he
struck
well
out
to
the
north
to
make
a
wide
circuit
around
it
this
brought
them
past
the
place
where
antonio
house
had
stood
here
alessandro
halted
and
putting
his
hand
on
baba
rein
walked
the
horses
close
to
the
pile
of
ruined
walls
this
was
antonio
house
majella
he
whispered
i
wish
every
house
in
the
valley
had
been
pulled
down
like
this
old
juana
was
right
the
americans
are
living
in
my
father
house
majella
he
went
on
his
whisper
growing
thick
with
rage
that
was
what
kept
me
so
long
i
was
looking
in
at
the
window
at
them
eating
their
supper
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
majella
if
i
had
had
my
gun
i
should
have
shot
them
all
dead
an
almost
inarticulate
gasp
was
ramona
first
reply
to
this
living
in
your
house
she
said
you
saw
them
yes
he
said
the
man
and
his
wife
and
two
little
children
and
the
man
came
out
with
his
gun
on
the
doorstep
and
fired
it
they
thought
they
heard
something
moving
and
it
might
be
an
indian
so
he
fired
that
was
what
kept
me
so
just
at
this
moment
baba
tripped
over
some
small
object
on
the
ground
a
few
steps
farther
and
he
tripped
again
there
is
something
caught
round
his
foot
alessandro
said
ramona
it
keeps
alessandro
jumped
off
his
horse
and
kneeling
down
exclaimed
it
a
stake
and
the
lariat
fastened
to
it
holy
virgin
what
the
rest
of
his
ejaculation
was
inaudible
the
next
ramona
knew
he
had
run
swiftly
on
a
rod
or
two
baba
had
followed
and
capitan
and
the
pony
and
there
stood
a
splendid
black
horse
as
big
as
baba
and
alessandro
talking
under
his
breath
to
him
and
clapping
both
his
hands
over
the
nose
to
stop
him
as
often
as
he
began
whinnying
and
it
seemed
hardly
a
second
more
before
he
had
his
saddle
off
the
poor
little
indian
pony
and
striking
it
sharply
on
its
sides
had
turned
it
free
had
saddled
the
black
horse
and
leaping
on
his
back
said
with
almost
a
sob
in
his
voice
my
majella
it
is
benito
my
own
benito
now
the
saints
indeed
have
helped
us
oh
the
ass
the
idiot
to
stake
out
benito
with
such
a
stake
as
that
a
jack
rabbit
had
pulled
it
up
now
my
majella
we
will
gallop
faster
faster
i
will
not
breathe
easy
till
we
are
out
of
this
cursed
valley
when
we
are
once
in
the
santa
margarita
canon
i
know
a
trail
they
will
never
find
like
the
wind
galloped
benito
alessandro
half
lying
on
his
back
stroking
his
forehead
whispering
to
him
the
horse
snorting
with
joy
which
were
gladder
of
the
two
horse
or
man
could
not
be
said
and
neck
by
neck
with
benito
came
baba
how
the
ground
flew
away
under
their
feet
this
was
companionship
indeed
worthy
of
baba
best
powers
not
in
all
the
california
herds
could
be
found
two
superber
horses
than
benito
and
baba
a
wild
almost
reckless
joy
took
possession
of
alessandro
ramona
was
half
terrified
as
she
heard
him
still
talking
talking
to
benito
for
an
hour
they
did
not
draw
rein
both
benito
and
alessandro
knew
every
inch
of
the
ground
then
just
as
they
had
descended
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
canon
alessandro
suddenly
reined
sharply
to
the
left
and
began
climbing
the
precipitous
wall
can
you
follow
dearest
majella
he
cried
do
you
suppose
benito
can
do
anything
that
baba
can
not
she
retorted
pressing
on
closely
but
baba
did
not
like
it
except
for
the
stimulus
of
benito
ahead
he
would
have
given
ramona
trouble
there
is
only
a
little
rough
like
this
dear
called
alessandro
as
he
leaped
a
fallen
tree
and
halted
to
see
how
baba
took
it
good
he
cried
as
baba
jumped
it
like
a
deer
good
majella
we
have
got
the
two
best
horses
in
the
country
you
see
they
are
alike
when
daylight
comes
i
have
often
wondered
they
were
so
much
alike
they
would
go
together
after
a
few
rods
of
this
steep
climbing
they
came
out
on
the
top
of
the
canon
south
wall
in
a
dense
oak
forest
comparatively
free
from
underbrush
now
said
alessandro
i
can
go
from
here
to
san
diego
by
paths
that
no
white
man
knows
we
will
be
near
there
before
already
the
keen
salt
air
of
the
ocean
smote
their
faces
ramona
drank
it
in
with
delight
i
taste
salt
in
the
air
alessandro
she
cried
yes
it
is
the
sea
he
said
this
canon
leads
straight
to
the
sea
i
wish
we
could
go
by
the
shore
majella
it
is
beautiful
there
when
it
is
still
the
waves
come
as
gently
to
the
land
as
if
they
were
in
play
and
you
can
ride
along
with
your
horse
feet
in
the
water
and
the
green
cliffs
almost
over
your
head
and
the
air
off
the
water
is
like
wine
in
one
can
not
we
go
there
she
said
longingly
would
it
not
be
safe
i
dare
not
he
answered
regretfully
not
now
majella
for
on
the
at
all
times
there
are
people
going
and
some
other
time
alessandro
we
can
come
after
we
are
married
and
there
is
no
danger
she
asked
yes
majella
he
replied
but
as
he
spoke
the
words
he
thought
will
a
time
ever
come
when
there
will
be
no
danger
the
shore
of
the
pacific
ocean
for
many
miles
north
of
san
diego
is
a
succession
of
rounding
promontories
walling
the
mouths
of
canons
down
many
of
which
small
streams
make
to
the
sea
these
canons
are
green
and
rich
at
bottom
and
filled
with
trees
chiefly
oak
beginning
as
little
more
than
rifts
in
the
ground
they
deepen
and
widen
till
at
their
mouths
they
have
a
beautiful
crescent
of
shining
beach
from
an
eighth
to
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
the
one
which
alessandro
hoped
to
reach
before
morning
was
not
a
dozen
miles
from
the
old
town
of
san
diego
and
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
outer
harbor
when
he
was
last
in
it
he
had
found
it
a
nearly
impenetrable
thicket
of
young
here
he
believed
they
could
hide
safely
all
day
and
after
nightfall
ride
into
san
diego
be
married
at
the
priest
house
and
push
on
to
san
pasquale
that
same
night
all
day
in
that
canon
majella
can
look
at
the
sea
he
thought
but
i
will
not
tell
her
now
for
it
may
be
the
trees
have
been
cut
down
and
we
can
not
be
so
close
to
the
it
was
near
sunrise
when
they
reached
the
place
the
trees
had
not
been
cut
down
their
tops
seen
from
above
looked
like
a
solid
bed
of
moss
filling
in
the
canon
bottom
the
sky
and
the
sea
were
both
red
as
ramona
looked
down
into
this
soft
green
pathway
it
seemed
leading
out
to
the
wide
and
sparkling
sea
she
thought
alessandro
had
brought
her
into
a
what
a
beautiful
world
she
cried
and
riding
up
so
close
to
benito
that
she
could
lay
her
hand
on
alessandro
she
said
solemnly
do
you
not
think
we
ought
to
be
very
happy
alessandro
in
such
a
beautiful
world
as
this
do
you
think
we
might
sing
our
sunrise
hymn
here
alessandro
glanced
around
they
were
alone
on
the
breezy
open
it
was
not
yet
full
dawn
great
masses
of
crimson
vapor
were
floating
upward
from
the
hills
behind
san
diego
the
light
was
still
burning
in
the
on
the
promontory
walling
the
inner
harbor
but
in
a
few
moments
more
it
would
be
day
no
majella
not
he
said
we
must
not
stay
as
soon
as
the
sun
rises
a
man
or
a
horse
may
be
seen
on
this
upper
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
we
must
be
among
the
trees
with
all
the
speed
we
can
it
was
like
a
house
with
a
high
thick
roof
of
oak
the
shelter
they
found
no
sun
penetrated
it
a
tiny
trickle
of
water
still
remained
and
some
grass
along
its
rims
was
still
green
spite
of
the
long
drought
a
scanty
meal
for
baba
and
benito
but
they
ate
it
with
relish
in
each
other
company
they
like
each
other
those
two
said
ramona
laughing
as
she
watched
them
they
will
be
ay
said
alessandro
also
smiling
horses
are
friends
like
men
and
can
hate
each
other
like
men
too
benito
would
never
see
mare
the
little
yellow
one
that
he
did
not
let
fly
his
heels
at
her
and
she
was
as
afraid
at
sight
of
him
as
a
cat
is
at
a
dog
many
a
time
i
have
laughed
to
see
know
you
the
priest
at
san
diego
asked
ramona
not
well
replied
alessandro
he
came
seldom
to
temecula
when
i
was
there
but
he
is
a
friend
of
indians
i
know
he
came
with
the
men
from
san
diego
at
the
time
when
there
was
fighting
and
the
whites
were
in
great
terror
and
they
said
except
for
father
gaspara
words
there
would
not
have
been
a
white
man
left
alive
in
pala
my
father
had
sent
all
his
people
away
before
that
fight
began
he
knew
it
was
coming
but
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
said
the
indians
were
all
crazy
it
was
no
use
they
would
only
be
killed
themselves
that
is
the
worst
thing
my
majella
the
stupid
indians
fight
and
kill
and
then
what
can
we
do
the
white
men
think
we
are
all
the
same
father
gaspara
has
never
been
to
pala
i
heard
since
that
time
there
goes
there
now
the
san
juan
capistrano
priest
he
is
a
bad
man
he
takes
money
from
the
starving
a
priest
ejaculated
ramona
ay
a
priest
replied
alessandro
they
are
not
all
good
not
like
father
oh
if
we
could
but
have
gone
to
father
salvierderra
exclaimed
ramona
involuntarily
alessandro
looked
distressed
it
would
have
been
much
more
danger
majella
he
said
and
i
had
no
knowledge
of
work
i
could
do
his
look
made
ramona
remorseful
at
once
how
cruel
to
lay
one
of
additional
burden
on
this
loving
man
oh
this
is
much
better
really
she
said
i
did
not
mean
what
i
said
it
is
only
because
i
have
always
loved
father
salvierderra
so
and
the
senora
will
tell
him
what
is
not
true
could
we
not
send
him
a
letter
alessandro
there
is
a
santa
inez
indian
i
know
replied
alessandro
who
comes
down
with
nets
to
sell
sometimes
to
temecula
i
know
not
if
he
goes
to
san
diego
if
i
could
get
speech
with
him
he
would
go
up
from
santa
inez
to
santa
barbara
for
me
i
am
sure
for
once
he
lay
in
my
house
sick
for
many
weeks
and
i
nursed
him
and
since
then
he
is
always
begging
me
to
take
a
net
from
him
whenever
he
comes
it
is
not
two
days
from
santa
inez
to
santa
i
wish
it
were
the
olden
time
now
alessandro
sighed
ramona
when
the
men
like
father
salvierderra
had
all
the
country
then
there
would
be
work
for
all
at
the
missions
the
senora
says
the
missions
were
like
palaces
and
that
there
were
thousands
of
indians
in
every
one
of
them
thousands
and
thousands
all
working
so
happy
and
the
senora
does
not
know
all
that
happened
at
the
missions
replied
alessandro
my
father
says
that
at
some
of
them
were
dreadful
things
when
bad
men
had
power
never
any
such
things
at
san
luis
rey
father
peyri
was
like
a
father
to
all
his
indians
my
father
says
that
they
would
all
of
them
lie
down
in
a
fire
for
him
if
he
had
commanded
it
and
when
he
went
away
to
leave
the
country
when
his
heart
was
broken
and
the
mission
all
ruined
he
had
to
fly
by
night
majella
just
as
you
and
i
have
done
for
if
the
indians
had
known
it
they
would
have
risen
up
to
keep
him
there
was
a
ship
here
in
san
diego
harbor
to
sail
for
mexico
and
the
father
made
up
his
mind
to
go
in
it
and
it
was
over
this
same
road
we
have
come
my
majella
that
he
rode
and
by
night
and
my
father
was
the
only
one
he
trusted
to
know
it
my
father
came
with
him
they
took
the
swiftest
horses
and
they
rode
all
night
and
my
father
carried
in
front
of
him
on
the
horse
a
box
of
the
sacred
things
of
the
altar
very
heavy
and
many
a
time
my
father
has
told
me
the
story
how
they
got
to
san
diego
at
daybreak
and
the
father
was
rowed
out
to
the
ship
in
a
little
boat
and
not
much
more
than
on
board
was
he
my
father
standing
like
one
dead
on
the
shore
watching
he
loved
him
so
when
lo
he
heard
a
great
crying
and
shouting
and
trampling
of
horses
feet
and
there
came
galloping
down
to
the
water
edge
three
hundred
of
the
indians
from
san
luis
rey
who
had
found
out
that
the
father
had
gone
to
san
diego
to
take
ship
and
they
had
ridden
all
night
on
his
track
to
fetch
him
back
and
when
my
father
pointed
to
the
ship
and
told
them
he
was
already
on
board
they
set
up
a
cry
fit
to
bring
the
very
sky
down
and
some
of
them
flung
themselves
into
the
sea
and
swam
out
to
the
ship
and
cried
and
begged
to
be
taken
on
board
and
go
with
him
and
father
peyri
stood
on
the
deck
blessing
them
and
saying
farewell
with
the
tears
running
on
his
face
and
one
of
the
indians
how
they
never
knew
made
shift
to
climb
up
on
the
chains
and
ropes
and
got
into
the
ship
itself
and
they
let
him
stay
and
he
sailed
away
with
the
father
and
my
father
said
he
was
all
his
life
sorry
that
he
himself
had
not
thought
to
do
the
same
thing
but
he
was
like
one
dumb
and
deaf
and
with
no
head
he
was
so
unhappy
at
the
father
was
it
here
in
this
very
harbor
asked
ramona
in
breathless
interest
pointing
out
towards
the
blue
water
of
which
they
could
see
a
broad
belt
framed
by
their
leafy
foreground
arch
of
oak
tops
ay
just
there
he
sailed
as
that
ship
goes
now
he
exclaimed
as
a
schooner
sailed
swiftly
by
going
out
to
sea
but
the
ship
lay
at
first
inside
the
bar
you
can
not
see
the
inside
harbor
from
here
it
is
the
most
beautiful
water
i
have
ever
seen
majella
the
two
high
lands
come
out
like
two
arms
to
hold
it
and
keep
it
safe
as
if
they
loved
but
alessandro
continued
ramona
were
there
really
bad
men
at
the
other
missions
surely
not
the
franciscan
fathers
perhaps
not
the
fathers
themselves
but
the
men
under
them
it
was
too
much
power
majella
when
my
father
has
told
me
how
it
was
it
has
seemed
to
me
i
should
not
have
liked
to
be
as
he
was
it
is
not
right
that
one
man
should
have
so
much
power
there
was
one
at
the
san
gabriel
mission
he
was
an
indian
he
had
been
set
over
the
rest
and
when
a
whole
band
of
them
ran
away
one
time
and
went
back
into
the
mountains
he
went
after
them
and
he
brought
back
a
piece
of
each
man
ear
the
pieces
were
strung
on
a
string
and
he
laughed
and
said
that
was
to
know
them
by
again
by
their
clipped
ears
an
old
woman
a
gabrieleno
who
came
over
to
temecula
told
me
she
saw
that
she
lived
at
the
mission
herself
the
indians
did
not
all
want
to
come
to
the
missions
some
of
them
preferred
to
stay
in
the
woods
and
live
as
they
always
had
lived
and
i
think
they
had
a
right
to
do
that
if
they
preferred
majella
it
was
stupid
of
them
to
stay
and
be
like
beasts
and
not
know
anything
but
do
you
not
think
they
had
the
right
it
is
the
command
to
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
replied
the
pious
ramona
that
is
what
father
salvierderra
said
was
the
reason
the
franciscans
came
here
i
think
they
ought
to
have
made
the
indians
listen
but
that
was
dreadful
about
the
ears
alessandro
do
you
believe
it
the
old
woman
laughed
when
she
told
it
he
answered
she
said
it
was
a
joke
so
i
think
it
was
true
i
know
i
would
have
killed
the
man
who
tried
to
crop
my
ears
that
did
you
ever
tell
that
to
father
salvierderra
asked
ramona
no
majella
it
would
not
be
polite
said
alessandro
well
i
do
believe
it
replied
ramona
in
a
relieved
tone
i
believe
any
franciscan
ever
could
have
permitted
such
the
great
red
light
in
the
tower
had
again
blazed
out
and
had
been
some
time
burning
before
alessandro
thought
it
prudent
to
resume
their
journey
the
road
on
which
they
must
go
into
old
san
diego
where
father
gaspara
lived
was
the
public
road
from
san
diego
to
san
luis
rey
and
they
were
almost
sure
to
meet
travellers
on
it
but
their
fleet
horses
bore
them
so
well
that
it
was
not
late
when
they
reached
the
town
father
gaspara
house
was
at
the
end
of
a
long
low
adobe
building
which
had
served
no
mean
purpose
in
the
old
presidio
days
but
was
now
fallen
into
decay
and
all
its
rooms
except
those
occupied
by
the
father
had
been
long
uninhabited
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
in
a
neglected
weedy
open
stood
his
chapel
a
little
place
its
walls
imperfectly
whitewashed
decorated
by
a
few
coarse
pictures
and
by
broken
sconces
of
rescued
in
their
dilapidated
condition
from
the
mission
buildings
now
gone
utterly
to
ruin
in
these
had
been
put
of
common
tin
in
which
a
few
cheap
candles
dimly
lighted
the
room
everything
about
it
was
in
unison
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
the
most
profoundly
melancholy
in
all
southern
california
here
was
the
spot
where
that
grand
old
franciscan
padre
junipero
serra
began
his
work
full
of
the
devout
and
ardent
purpose
to
reclaim
the
wilderness
and
its
peoples
to
his
country
and
his
church
on
this
very
beach
he
went
up
and
down
for
those
first
terrible
weeks
nursing
the
sick
praying
with
the
dying
and
burying
the
dead
from
the
mexican
ships
lying
in
the
harbor
here
he
baptized
his
first
indian
converts
and
founded
his
first
mission
and
the
only
traces
now
remaining
of
his
heroic
labors
and
successes
were
a
pile
of
crumbling
ruins
a
few
old
and
palms
in
less
than
another
century
even
these
would
be
gone
returned
into
the
keeping
of
that
mother
the
earth
who
puts
no
at
the
sacredest
of
her
graves
father
gaspara
had
been
for
many
years
at
san
diego
although
not
a
franciscan
having
indeed
no
especial
love
for
the
order
he
had
been
from
the
first
deeply
impressed
by
the
holy
associations
of
the
place
he
had
a
nature
at
once
fiery
and
poetic
there
were
but
three
things
he
could
have
been
a
soldier
a
poet
or
a
priest
circumstances
had
made
him
a
priest
and
the
fire
and
the
poetry
which
would
have
wielded
the
sword
or
kindled
the
verse
had
he
found
himself
set
either
to
fight
or
to
sing
had
all
gathered
into
added
force
in
his
priestly
vocation
the
look
of
a
soldier
he
had
never
quite
lost
neither
the
look
nor
the
tread
and
his
flashing
dark
eyes
heavy
black
hair
and
beard
and
quick
elastic
step
seemed
sometimes
strangely
out
of
harmony
with
his
priest
gown
and
it
was
the
sensitive
soul
of
the
poet
in
him
which
had
made
him
withdraw
within
himself
more
and
more
year
after
year
as
he
found
himself
comparatively
powerless
to
do
anything
for
the
hundreds
of
indians
that
he
would
fain
have
seen
gathered
once
more
as
of
old
into
the
keeping
of
the
church
he
had
made
frequent
visits
to
them
in
their
shifting
refuges
following
up
family
after
family
band
after
band
that
he
knew
he
had
written
bootless
letter
after
letter
to
the
government
officials
of
one
sort
and
another
at
washington
he
had
made
equally
bootless
efforts
to
win
some
justice
some
protection
for
them
from
officials
nearer
home
he
had
endeavored
to
stir
the
church
itself
to
greater
efficiency
in
their
behalf
finally
weary
disheartened
and
indignant
with
that
intense
suppressed
indignation
which
the
poetic
temperament
alone
can
feel
he
had
ceased
had
said
it
is
of
no
use
i
will
speak
no
word
i
am
done
i
can
bear
no
more
and
settling
down
into
the
routine
of
his
parochial
duties
to
the
little
mexican
and
irish
congregation
of
his
charge
in
san
diego
he
had
abandoned
all
effort
to
do
more
for
the
indians
than
visit
their
chief
settlements
once
or
twice
a
year
to
administer
the
sacraments
when
fresh
outrages
were
brought
to
his
notice
he
paced
his
room
plucked
fiercely
at
his
black
beard
with
ejaculations
it
is
to
be
feared
savoring
more
of
the
camp
than
the
altar
but
he
made
no
effort
to
do
anything
lighting
his
pipe
he
would
sit
down
on
the
old
bench
in
his
veranda
and
smoke
by
the
hour
gazing
out
on
the
placid
water
of
the
deserted
harbor
brooding
ever
brooding
over
the
wrongs
he
could
not
redress
a
few
paces
off
from
his
door
stood
the
just
begun
walls
of
a
fine
brick
church
which
it
had
been
the
dream
and
pride
of
his
heart
to
see
builded
and
full
of
worshippers
this
too
had
failed
with
san
diego
repeatedly
vanishing
hopes
and
dreams
of
prosperity
had
gone
this
hope
and
dream
of
father
gaspara
it
looked
now
as
if
it
would
be
indeed
a
waste
of
money
to
build
a
costly
church
on
this
site
sentiment
however
sacred
and
loving
towards
the
dead
must
yield
to
the
demands
of
the
living
to
build
a
church
on
the
ground
where
father
junipero
first
trod
and
labored
would
be
a
work
to
which
no
catholic
could
be
indifferent
but
there
were
other
and
more
pressing
claims
to
be
met
first
this
was
right
yet
the
sight
of
these
silent
walls
only
a
few
feet
high
was
a
sore
one
to
father
gaspara
a
daily
cross
which
he
did
not
find
grow
lighter
as
he
paced
up
and
down
his
veranda
year
in
and
year
out
in
the
balmy
winter
and
cool
summer
of
that
magic
climate
majella
the
chapel
is
lighted
but
that
is
good
exclaimed
alessandro
as
they
rode
into
the
silent
plaza
father
gaspara
must
be
there
and
jumping
off
his
horse
he
peered
in
at
the
uncurtained
window
a
marriage
majella
a
marriage
he
cried
hastily
returning
this
too
is
good
fortune
we
need
not
to
wait
when
the
sacristan
whispered
to
father
gaspara
that
an
indian
couple
had
just
come
in
wishing
to
be
married
the
father
frowned
his
supper
was
waiting
he
had
been
out
all
day
over
at
the
old
mission
where
he
had
not
found
things
to
his
mind
the
indian
man
and
wife
whom
he
hired
to
take
care
of
the
few
acres
the
church
yet
owned
there
had
been
neglecting
the
church
lands
and
trees
to
look
after
their
own
the
father
was
vexed
tired
and
hungry
and
the
expression
with
which
he
regarded
alessandro
and
ramona
as
they
came
towards
him
was
one
of
the
least
prepossessing
of
which
his
dark
face
was
capable
ramona
who
had
never
knelt
to
any
priest
save
the
gentle
father
salvierderra
and
who
had
supposed
that
all
priests
must
look
at
least
friendly
was
shocked
at
the
sight
of
the
impatient
visage
confronting
her
but
as
his
first
glance
fell
on
ramona
father
gaspara
expression
changed
what
is
all
this
he
thought
and
as
quick
as
he
thought
it
he
exclaimed
in
a
severe
tone
looking
at
ramona
woman
are
you
an
indian
yes
father
answered
ramona
gently
my
mother
was
an
ah
thought
father
gaspara
it
is
strange
how
sometimes
one
of
the
types
will
conquer
and
sometimes
another
but
this
is
no
common
creature
and
it
was
with
a
look
of
new
interest
and
sympathy
on
his
face
that
he
proceeded
with
the
ceremony
the
other
couple
a
irishman
with
his
more
than
bride
standing
quietly
by
and
looking
on
with
a
vague
sort
of
wonder
in
their
ugly
impassive
faces
as
if
it
struck
them
oddly
that
indians
should
marry
the
book
of
the
was
kept
in
father
gaspara
own
rooms
locked
up
and
hidden
even
from
his
old
housekeeper
he
had
had
bitter
reason
to
take
this
precaution
it
had
been
for
more
than
one
interest
to
cut
leaves
out
of
this
old
record
which
dated
back
to
and
had
many
pages
written
full
in
the
hand
of
father
junipero
himself
as
they
came
out
of
the
chapel
father
gaspara
leading
the
way
the
irish
couple
shambling
along
shamefacedly
apart
from
each
other
alessandro
still
holding
ramona
hand
in
his
said
will
you
ride
dear
it
is
but
a
no
thanks
dear
alessandro
i
would
rather
walk
she
replied
and
alessandro
slipping
the
bridles
of
the
two
horses
over
his
left
arm
they
walked
on
father
gaspara
heard
the
question
and
answer
and
was
still
more
puzzled
he
speaks
as
a
gentleman
speaks
to
a
lady
he
mused
what
does
it
mean
who
are
they
father
gaspara
was
a
man
and
in
his
home
in
spain
had
been
used
to
associations
far
superior
to
any
which
he
had
known
in
his
californian
life
a
gentle
courtesy
of
tone
and
speech
such
as
that
with
which
alessandro
had
addressed
ramona
was
not
often
heard
in
his
parish
when
they
entered
his
house
he
again
regarded
them
both
attentively
ramona
wore
on
her
head
the
usual
black
shawl
of
the
mexican
women
there
was
nothing
distinctive
to
the
father
eye
in
her
figure
or
face
in
the
dim
light
of
the
one
candle
father
gaspara
allowed
himself
no
luxuries
the
exquisite
coloring
of
her
skin
and
the
deep
blue
of
her
eyes
were
not
to
be
seen
alessandro
tall
figure
and
dignified
bearing
were
not
uncommon
the
father
had
seen
many
as
indian
men
but
his
voice
was
remarkable
and
he
spoke
better
spanish
than
was
wont
to
be
heard
from
indians
where
are
you
from
said
the
father
as
he
held
his
pen
poised
in
hand
ready
to
write
their
names
in
the
old
book
temecula
father
replied
alessandro
father
gaspara
dropped
his
pen
the
village
the
americans
drove
out
the
other
day
he
cried
yes
father
gaspara
sprang
from
his
chair
took
refuge
from
his
excitement
as
usual
in
pacing
the
floor
go
go
i
done
with
you
it
all
over
he
said
fiercely
to
the
irish
bride
and
groom
who
had
given
him
their
names
and
their
fee
but
were
still
hanging
about
irresolute
not
knowing
if
all
were
ended
or
not
a
burning
shame
the
most
dastardly
thing
i
have
seen
yet
in
this
land
forsaken
of
god
cried
the
father
i
saw
the
particulars
of
it
in
the
san
diego
paper
then
coming
to
a
halt
in
front
of
alessandro
he
exclaimed
the
paper
said
that
the
indians
were
compelled
to
pay
all
the
costs
of
the
suit
that
the
sheriff
took
their
cattle
to
do
it
was
that
true
yes
father
replied
alessandro
the
father
strode
up
and
down
again
plucking
at
his
beard
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
where
have
you
all
gone
there
were
two
hundred
in
your
village
the
last
time
i
was
some
have
gone
over
into
pachanga
replied
alessandro
some
to
san
pasquale
and
the
rest
to
san
body
of
jesus
man
but
you
take
it
with
philosophy
stormed
father
gaspara
alessandro
did
not
understand
the
word
philosophy
but
he
knew
what
the
father
meant
yes
father
he
said
doggedly
it
is
now
days
ago
i
was
not
so
at
first
there
is
nothing
to
be
ramona
held
tight
to
alessandro
hand
she
was
afraid
of
this
fierce
priest
who
dashed
back
and
forth
pouring
out
angry
invectives
the
united
states
government
will
suffer
for
it
he
continued
it
is
a
government
of
thieves
and
robbers
god
will
punish
them
you
will
see
they
will
be
visited
with
a
curse
a
curse
in
their
borders
their
sons
and
their
daughters
shall
be
desolate
but
why
do
i
prate
in
these
vain
words
my
son
tell
me
your
names
again
and
he
seated
himself
once
more
at
the
table
where
the
ancient
lay
open
after
writing
alessandro
name
he
turned
to
ramona
and
the
woman
he
said
alessandro
looked
at
ramona
in
the
chapel
he
had
said
simply
what
name
should
he
give
more
without
a
second
hesitation
ramona
answered
majella
majella
phail
is
my
she
pronounced
the
word
phail
slowly
it
was
new
to
her
she
had
never
seen
it
written
as
it
lingered
on
her
lips
the
father
to
whom
also
it
was
a
new
word
misunderstood
it
took
it
to
be
in
two
syllables
and
so
wrote
it
the
last
step
was
taken
in
the
disappearance
of
ramona
how
should
any
one
searching
in
after
years
find
any
trace
of
ramona
ortegna
in
the
woman
married
under
the
name
of
majella
fayeel
no
no
put
up
your
money
son
said
father
gaspara
as
alessandro
began
to
undo
the
knots
of
the
handkerchief
in
which
his
gold
was
tied
put
up
your
money
i
take
no
money
from
a
temecula
indian
i
would
the
church
had
money
to
give
you
where
are
you
going
now
to
san
pasquale
ah
san
pasquale
the
head
man
there
has
the
old
pueblo
paper
said
father
gaspara
he
was
showing
it
to
me
the
other
day
that
will
it
may
be
save
you
there
but
do
not
trust
to
it
son
buy
yourself
a
piece
of
land
as
the
white
man
buys
his
trust
to
alessandro
looked
anxiously
in
the
father
face
how
is
that
father
he
said
i
do
not
well
their
rules
be
thick
as
the
crabs
here
on
the
beach
replied
father
gaspara
and
faith
they
appear
to
me
to
be
backwards
of
motion
also
like
the
crabs
but
the
lawyers
understand
when
you
have
picked
out
your
land
and
have
the
money
come
to
me
and
i
will
go
with
you
and
see
that
you
are
not
cheated
in
the
buying
so
far
as
i
can
tell
but
i
myself
am
at
my
wit
ends
with
their
devices
farewell
son
farewell
daughter
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
hunger
was
again
getting
the
better
of
sympathy
in
father
gaspara
and
as
he
sat
down
to
his
supper
the
indian
couple
faded
from
his
mind
but
after
supper
was
over
as
he
sat
smoking
his
pipe
on
the
veranda
they
returned
again
and
lingered
in
his
thoughts
lingered
strangely
it
seemed
to
him
he
could
not
shake
off
the
impression
that
there
was
something
unusual
about
the
woman
i
shall
hear
of
them
again
some
day
he
thought
and
he
thought
rightly
xix
after
leaving
father
gaspara
door
alessandro
and
ramona
rode
slowly
through
the
now
deserted
plaza
and
turned
northward
on
the
river
road
leaving
the
old
presidio
walls
on
their
right
the
river
was
low
and
they
forded
it
without
difficulty
i
have
seen
this
river
so
high
that
there
was
no
fording
it
for
many
days
said
alessandro
but
that
was
in
then
it
is
well
we
came
not
at
that
time
said
ramona
all
the
times
have
fallen
out
well
for
us
alessandro
the
dark
nights
and
the
streams
low
but
look
as
i
say
it
there
comes
the
moon
and
she
pointed
to
the
fine
threadlike
arc
of
the
new
moon
just
visible
in
the
sky
not
big
enough
to
do
us
any
harm
however
she
added
but
dear
alessandro
do
you
not
think
we
are
safe
now
i
know
not
majella
if
ever
we
may
be
safe
but
i
hope
so
i
have
been
all
day
thinking
i
had
gone
foolish
last
night
when
i
told
hartsel
that
i
was
on
my
way
to
san
pasquale
but
if
men
should
come
there
asking
for
us
she
would
understand
i
think
and
keep
a
still
tongue
she
would
keep
harm
from
us
if
she
their
way
from
san
diego
to
san
pasquale
lay
at
first
along
a
high
mesa
or
covered
with
low
shrub
growths
after
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
this
they
descended
among
winding
ridges
into
a
narrow
valley
the
poway
valley
it
was
here
that
the
mexicans
made
one
of
their
few
abortive
efforts
to
repel
the
american
forces
here
were
some
americans
killed
in
a
fight
with
the
mexicans
majella
said
alessandro
i
myself
have
a
dozen
bullets
which
i
picked
up
in
the
ground
about
here
many
a
time
i
have
looked
at
them
and
thought
if
there
should
come
another
war
against
the
americans
i
would
fire
them
again
if
i
could
does
senor
felipe
think
there
is
any
likelihood
that
his
people
will
rise
against
them
any
more
if
they
would
they
would
have
all
the
indians
to
help
them
now
it
would
be
a
mercy
if
they
might
be
driven
out
of
the
land
yes
sighed
majella
but
there
is
no
hope
i
have
heard
the
senora
speak
of
it
with
felipe
there
is
no
hope
they
have
power
and
great
riches
she
said
money
is
all
that
they
think
of
to
get
money
they
will
commit
any
crime
even
murder
every
day
there
comes
the
news
of
their
murdering
each
other
for
gold
mexicans
kill
each
other
only
for
hate
alessandro
for
hate
or
in
anger
never
for
indians
also
replied
alessandro
never
one
indian
killed
another
yet
for
money
it
is
for
vengeance
always
for
money
bah
majella
they
are
dogs
rarely
did
alessandro
speak
with
such
vehemence
but
this
last
outrage
on
his
people
had
kindled
in
his
veins
a
fire
of
scorn
and
hatred
which
would
never
die
out
trust
in
an
american
was
henceforth
to
him
impossible
the
name
was
a
synonym
for
fraud
and
cruelty
they
can
not
all
be
so
bad
i
think
alessandro
said
ramona
there
must
be
some
that
are
honest
do
you
not
think
so
where
are
they
then
he
cried
fiercely
the
ones
who
are
good
among
my
people
there
are
always
some
that
are
bad
but
they
are
in
disgrace
my
father
punished
them
the
whole
people
punished
them
if
there
are
americans
who
are
good
who
will
not
cheat
and
kill
why
do
they
not
send
after
these
robbers
and
punish
them
and
how
is
it
that
they
make
laws
which
cheat
it
was
the
american
law
which
took
temecula
away
from
us
and
gave
it
to
those
men
the
law
was
on
the
side
of
the
thieves
no
majella
it
is
a
people
that
steals
that
is
their
name
a
people
that
steals
and
that
kills
for
money
is
not
that
a
good
name
for
a
great
people
to
bear
when
they
are
like
the
sands
in
the
sea
they
are
so
many
that
is
what
the
senora
says
answered
ramona
she
says
they
are
all
thieves
that
she
knows
not
each
day
but
that
on
the
next
will
come
more
of
them
with
new
laws
to
take
away
more
of
her
land
she
had
once
more
than
twice
what
she
has
now
yes
he
replied
i
know
it
my
father
has
told
me
he
was
with
father
peyri
at
the
place
when
general
moreno
was
alive
then
all
was
his
to
the
sea
all
that
land
we
rode
over
the
second
night
yes
she
said
all
to
the
sea
that
is
what
the
senora
is
ever
saying
the
sea
oh
the
beautiful
sea
can
we
behold
it
from
san
pasquale
alessandro
no
my
majella
it
is
too
far
san
pasquale
is
in
the
valley
it
has
hills
all
around
it
like
walls
but
it
is
good
majella
will
love
it
and
i
will
build
a
house
majella
all
the
people
will
help
me
that
is
the
way
with
our
people
in
two
days
it
will
be
done
but
it
will
be
a
poor
place
for
my
majella
he
said
sadly
alessandro
heart
was
ill
at
ease
truly
a
strange
bride
journey
was
this
but
ramona
felt
no
fear
no
place
can
be
so
poor
that
i
do
not
choose
it
if
you
are
there
rather
than
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
where
you
are
not
alessandro
she
said
but
my
majella
loves
things
that
are
beautiful
said
alessandro
she
has
lived
like
a
oh
alessandro
merrily
laughed
ramona
how
little
you
know
of
the
way
queens
live
nothing
was
fine
at
the
senora
moreno
only
comfortable
and
any
house
you
will
build
i
can
make
as
comfortable
as
that
was
it
is
nothing
but
trouble
to
have
one
so
large
as
the
senora
margarita
used
to
be
tired
to
death
sweeping
all
those
rooms
in
which
nobody
lived
except
the
blessed
old
san
luis
rey
saints
alessandro
if
we
could
have
had
just
one
statue
either
saint
francis
or
the
madonna
to
bring
back
to
our
house
that
is
what
i
would
like
better
than
all
other
things
in
the
world
it
is
beautiful
to
sleep
with
the
madonna
close
to
your
bed
she
speaks
often
to
you
in
alessandro
fixed
serious
questioning
eyes
on
ramona
as
she
uttered
these
words
when
she
spoke
like
this
he
felt
indeed
as
if
a
being
of
some
other
sphere
had
come
to
dwell
by
his
side
i
can
not
find
how
to
feel
towards
the
saints
as
you
do
my
majella
he
said
i
am
afraid
of
them
it
must
be
because
they
love
you
and
do
not
love
us
that
is
what
i
believe
majella
i
believe
they
are
displeased
with
us
and
no
longer
make
mention
of
us
in
heaven
that
is
what
the
fathers
taught
that
the
saints
were
ever
doing
praying
to
god
for
us
and
to
the
virgin
and
jesus
it
is
not
possible
you
see
that
they
could
have
been
praying
for
us
and
yet
such
things
have
happened
as
happened
in
temecula
i
do
not
know
how
it
is
my
people
have
displeased
i
think
father
salvierderra
would
say
that
it
is
a
sin
to
be
afraid
of
the
saints
alessandro
replied
ramona
earnestly
he
has
often
told
me
that
it
was
a
sin
to
be
unhappy
and
that
withheld
me
many
times
from
being
wretched
because
the
senora
would
not
love
me
and
alessandro
she
went
on
growing
more
and
more
fervent
in
tone
even
if
nothing
but
misfortune
comes
to
people
that
does
not
prove
that
the
saints
do
not
love
them
for
when
the
saints
were
on
earth
themselves
look
what
they
suffered
martyrs
they
were
almost
all
of
them
look
at
what
holy
saint
catharine
endured
and
the
blessed
saint
agnes
it
is
not
by
what
happens
to
us
here
in
this
world
that
we
can
tell
if
the
saints
love
us
or
if
we
will
see
the
blessed
how
can
we
tell
then
he
asked
by
what
we
feel
in
our
hearts
alessandro
she
replied
just
as
i
knew
all
the
time
when
you
did
not
come
i
knew
that
you
loved
me
i
knew
that
in
my
heart
and
i
shall
always
know
it
no
matter
what
happens
if
you
are
dead
i
shall
know
that
you
love
me
and
you
you
will
know
that
i
love
you
the
yes
said
alessandro
reflectively
that
is
true
but
majella
it
is
not
possible
to
have
the
same
thoughts
about
a
saint
as
about
a
person
that
one
has
seen
and
heard
the
voice
and
touched
the
no
not
quite
said
ramona
not
quite
about
a
saint
but
one
can
for
the
blessed
virgin
alessandro
i
am
sure
of
that
her
statue
in
my
room
at
the
senora
has
been
always
my
mother
ever
since
i
was
little
i
have
told
her
all
i
did
it
was
she
helped
me
to
plan
what
i
should
bring
away
with
us
she
reminded
me
of
many
things
i
had
forgotten
except
for
did
you
hear
her
speak
said
alessandro
not
exactly
in
words
but
just
the
same
as
in
words
replied
ramona
confidently
you
see
when
you
sleep
in
the
room
with
her
it
is
very
different
from
what
it
is
if
you
only
see
her
in
a
chapel
oh
i
could
never
be
very
unhappy
with
her
in
my
room
i
would
almost
go
and
steal
it
for
you
majella
cried
alessandro
with
sacrilegious
warmth
holy
virgin
cried
ramona
never
speak
such
a
word
you
would
be
struck
dead
if
you
laid
your
hand
on
her
i
fear
even
the
thought
was
a
there
was
a
small
figure
of
her
in
the
wall
of
our
house
said
alessandro
it
was
from
san
luis
rey
i
do
not
know
what
became
of
it
if
it
were
left
behind
or
if
they
took
it
with
my
father
things
to
pachanga
i
did
not
see
it
there
when
i
go
again
i
will
again
cried
ramona
what
say
you
you
go
again
to
pachanga
you
will
not
leave
me
alessandro
at
the
bare
mention
of
alessandro
leaving
her
ramona
courage
always
vanished
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
she
was
transformed
from
the
dauntless
confident
sunny
woman
who
bore
him
up
as
it
were
on
wings
of
hope
and
faith
to
a
timid
shrinking
despondent
child
crying
out
in
alarm
and
clinging
to
the
hand
after
a
time
dear
majella
when
you
are
wonted
to
the
place
i
must
go
to
fetch
the
wagon
and
the
few
things
that
were
ours
there
is
the
bed
which
was
father
peyri
and
he
gave
to
my
father
majella
will
like
to
lie
on
that
my
father
believed
it
had
great
like
that
you
made
for
felipe
she
asked
yes
but
it
is
not
so
large
in
those
days
the
cattle
were
not
so
large
as
they
are
now
this
is
not
so
broad
as
senor
felipe
there
are
chairs
too
from
the
mission
three
of
them
one
almost
as
fine
as
those
on
your
veranda
at
home
they
were
given
to
my
father
and
beautiful
parchment
books
oh
i
hope
those
are
not
lost
majella
if
jose
had
lived
he
would
have
looked
after
it
all
but
in
the
confusion
all
the
things
belonging
to
the
village
were
thrown
into
wagons
together
and
no
one
knew
where
anything
was
but
all
the
people
knew
my
father
chairs
and
the
books
of
the
music
if
the
americans
did
not
steal
them
everything
will
be
safe
my
people
do
not
steal
there
was
never
but
one
thief
in
our
village
and
my
father
had
him
so
whipped
he
ran
away
and
never
came
back
i
heard
he
was
living
in
san
jacinto
and
was
a
thief
yet
spite
of
all
that
whipping
he
had
i
think
if
it
is
in
the
blood
to
be
a
thief
not
even
whipping
will
take
it
out
like
the
americans
she
said
half
laughing
but
with
tears
in
the
voice
whipping
would
not
cure
it
wanted
yet
more
than
an
hour
of
dawn
when
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
from
which
they
looked
down
on
the
san
pasquale
valley
two
such
crests
and
valleys
they
had
passed
this
was
the
broadest
of
the
three
valleys
and
the
hills
walling
it
were
softer
and
rounder
of
contour
than
any
they
had
yet
seen
to
the
east
and
northeast
lay
ranges
of
high
mountains
their
tops
lost
in
the
clouds
the
whole
sky
was
overcast
and
gray
if
it
were
spring
this
would
mean
rain
said
alessandro
but
it
can
not
rain
i
think
no
laughed
ramona
not
till
we
get
our
house
done
will
it
be
of
adobe
alessandro
dearest
majella
not
yet
at
first
it
must
be
of
the
tule
they
are
very
comfortable
while
it
is
warm
and
before
winter
i
will
build
one
of
two
houses
wasteful
alessandro
if
the
tule
house
is
good
i
shall
not
let
you
alessandro
build
ramona
mirthful
moments
bewildered
alessandro
to
his
slower
temperament
and
saddened
nature
they
seemed
preternatural
as
if
she
were
all
of
a
sudden
changed
into
a
bird
or
some
gay
creature
outside
the
pale
of
human
life
outside
and
above
it
you
speak
as
the
birds
sing
my
majella
he
said
slowly
it
was
well
to
name
you
majel
only
the
has
not
joy
in
her
voice
as
you
have
she
says
only
that
she
loves
and
i
say
that
too
alessandro
replied
ramona
reaching
out
both
her
arms
towards
him
the
horses
were
walking
slowly
and
very
close
side
by
side
baba
and
benito
were
now
such
friends
they
liked
to
pace
closely
side
by
side
and
baba
and
benito
were
by
no
means
without
instinctive
recognitions
of
the
sympathy
between
their
riders
already
benito
knew
ramona
voice
and
answered
it
with
pleasure
and
baba
had
long
ago
learned
to
stop
when
his
mistress
laid
her
hand
on
alessandro
shoulder
he
stopped
now
and
it
was
long
minutes
before
he
had
the
signal
to
go
on
again
majella
majella
cried
alessandro
as
grasping
both
her
hands
in
his
he
held
them
to
his
cheeks
to
his
neck
to
his
mouth
if
the
saints
would
ask
alessandro
to
be
a
martyr
for
majella
sake
like
those
she
was
telling
of
then
she
would
know
if
alessandro
loved
her
but
what
can
alessandro
do
now
what
oh
what
majella
gives
all
alessandro
gives
nothing
and
he
bowed
his
forehead
on
her
hands
before
he
put
them
back
gently
on
baba
neck
tears
filled
ramona
eyes
how
should
she
win
this
saddened
man
this
distrusting
lover
to
the
joy
which
was
his
desert
alessandro
can
do
one
thing
she
said
insensibly
falling
into
his
mode
of
speaking
one
thing
for
his
majella
never
never
say
that
he
has
nothing
to
give
her
when
he
says
that
he
makes
majella
a
liar
for
she
has
said
that
he
is
all
the
world
to
her
he
himself
all
the
world
which
she
desires
is
majella
a
liar
but
it
was
even
now
with
an
ecstasy
only
half
joy
the
other
half
anguish
that
alessandro
replied
majella
can
not
lie
majella
is
like
the
saints
alessandro
is
when
they
rode
down
into
the
valley
the
whole
village
was
astir
the
had
nearly
passed
everywhere
were
to
be
seen
large
flat
baskets
of
grapes
drying
in
the
sun
old
women
and
children
were
turning
these
or
pounding
acorns
in
the
deep
stone
bowls
others
were
beating
the
and
putting
them
to
soak
in
water
the
oldest
women
were
sitting
on
the
ground
weaving
baskets
there
were
not
many
men
in
the
village
now
two
large
bands
were
away
at
work
one
at
the
autumn
and
one
working
on
a
large
irrigating
ditch
at
san
bernardino
in
different
directions
from
the
village
herds
of
goats
or
of
cattle
could
be
seen
being
driven
to
pasture
on
the
hills
some
men
were
ploughing
several
groups
were
at
work
building
houses
of
bundles
of
the
tule
reeds
these
are
some
of
the
temecula
people
said
alessandro
they
are
building
themselves
new
houses
here
see
those
piles
of
bundles
than
the
rest
those
are
their
old
roofs
they
brought
from
temecula
there
there
comes
ysidro
he
cried
joyfully
as
a
man
who
had
been
riding
from
point
to
point
in
the
village
came
galloping
towards
them
as
soon
as
ysidro
recognized
alessandro
he
flung
himself
from
his
horse
alessandro
did
the
same
and
both
running
swiftly
towards
each
other
till
they
met
they
embraced
silently
ramona
riding
up
held
out
her
hand
saying
as
she
did
so
ysidro
pleased
yet
surprised
at
this
confident
and
assured
greeting
ysidro
saluted
her
and
turning
to
alessandro
said
in
their
own
tongue
who
is
this
woman
whom
you
bring
that
has
heard
my
name
my
wife
answered
alessandro
in
the
same
tongue
we
were
married
last
night
by
father
gaspara
she
comes
from
the
house
of
the
senora
moreno
we
will
live
in
san
pasquale
if
you
have
land
for
me
as
you
have
what
astonishment
ysidro
felt
he
showed
none
only
a
grave
and
courteous
welcome
was
in
his
face
and
in
his
words
as
he
said
it
is
well
there
is
room
you
are
but
when
he
heard
the
soft
spanish
syllables
in
which
ramona
spoke
to
alessandro
and
alessandro
translating
her
words
to
him
said
majel
speaks
only
in
the
spanish
tongue
but
she
will
learn
ours
a
look
of
disquiet
passed
over
his
countenance
his
heart
feared
for
alessandro
and
he
said
is
she
then
not
indian
whence
got
she
the
name
of
majel
a
look
of
swift
intelligence
from
alessandro
reassured
him
indian
on
the
mother
side
said
alessandro
and
she
belongs
in
heart
to
our
people
she
is
alone
save
for
me
she
is
one
blessed
of
the
virgin
ysidro
she
will
help
us
the
name
majel
i
have
given
her
for
she
is
like
the
and
she
is
glad
to
lay
her
old
name
down
forever
to
bear
this
new
name
in
our
and
this
was
ramona
introduction
to
the
indian
village
this
and
her
smile
perhaps
the
smile
did
most
even
the
little
children
were
not
afraid
of
her
the
women
though
shy
in
the
beginning
at
sight
of
her
noble
bearing
and
her
clothes
of
a
kind
and
quality
they
associated
only
with
superiors
soon
felt
her
friendliness
and
what
was
more
saw
by
her
every
word
tone
look
that
she
was
alessandro
if
alessandro
theirs
she
was
one
of
them
ramona
would
have
been
profoundly
impressed
and
touched
could
she
have
heard
them
speaking
among
themselves
about
her
wondering
how
it
had
come
about
that
she
so
beautiful
and
nurtured
in
the
moreno
house
of
which
they
all
knew
should
be
alessandro
loving
wife
it
must
be
they
thought
in
their
simplicity
that
the
saints
had
sent
it
as
an
omen
of
good
to
the
indian
people
toward
night
they
came
bringing
in
a
the
most
aged
woman
in
the
village
to
look
at
her
she
wished
to
see
the
beautiful
stranger
before
the
sun
went
down
they
said
because
she
was
now
so
old
she
believed
each
night
that
before
morning
her
time
would
come
to
die
they
also
wished
to
hear
the
old
woman
verdict
on
her
when
alessandro
saw
them
coming
he
understood
and
made
haste
to
explain
it
to
ramona
while
he
was
yet
speaking
the
procession
arrived
and
the
aged
woman
in
her
strange
litter
was
placed
silently
on
the
ground
in
front
of
ramona
who
was
sitting
under
ysidro
great
those
who
had
borne
her
withdrew
and
seated
themselves
a
few
paces
off
alessandro
spoke
first
in
a
few
words
he
told
the
old
woman
of
ramona
birth
of
their
marriage
and
of
her
new
name
of
adoption
then
he
said
take
her
hand
dear
majella
if
you
feel
no
there
was
something
scarcely
human
in
the
shrivelled
arm
and
hand
outstretched
in
greeting
but
ramona
took
it
in
hers
with
tender
reverence
say
to
her
for
me
alessandro
she
said
that
i
bow
down
to
her
great
age
with
reverence
and
that
i
hope
if
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
i
live
on
the
earth
so
long
as
she
has
i
may
be
worthy
of
such
reverence
as
these
people
all
feel
for
alessandro
turned
a
grateful
look
on
ramona
as
he
translated
this
speech
so
in
unison
with
indian
modes
of
thought
and
feeling
a
murmur
of
pleasure
rose
from
the
group
of
women
sitting
by
the
aged
woman
made
no
reply
her
eyes
still
studied
ramona
face
and
she
still
held
her
hand
tell
her
continued
ramona
that
i
ask
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
her
say
i
will
be
her
daughter
if
she
will
let
it
must
be
the
virgin
herself
that
is
teaching
majella
what
to
say
thought
alessandro
as
he
repeated
this
in
the
san
luiseno
tongue
again
the
women
murmured
pleasure
but
the
old
woman
spoke
not
and
say
that
you
will
be
her
son
added
ramona
alessandro
said
it
it
was
perhaps
for
this
that
the
old
woman
had
waited
lifting
up
her
arm
like
a
sibyl
she
said
it
is
well
i
am
your
mother
the
winds
of
the
valley
shall
love
you
and
the
grass
shall
dance
when
you
come
the
daughter
looks
on
her
mother
face
each
day
i
will
go
and
making
a
sign
to
her
bearers
she
was
lifted
and
carried
to
her
house
the
scene
affected
ramona
deeply
the
simplest
acts
of
these
people
seemed
to
her
marvellously
profound
in
their
meanings
she
was
not
herself
sufficiently
educated
or
versed
in
life
to
know
why
she
was
so
moved
to
know
that
such
utterances
such
symbolisms
as
these
among
primitive
peoples
are
thus
impressive
because
they
are
truly
and
grandly
dramatic
but
she
was
none
the
less
stirred
by
them
because
she
could
not
analyze
or
explain
them
i
will
go
and
see
her
every
day
she
said
she
shall
be
like
my
mother
whom
i
never
we
must
both
go
each
day
said
alessandro
what
we
have
said
is
a
solemn
promise
among
my
people
it
would
not
be
possible
to
break
ysidro
home
was
in
the
centre
of
the
village
on
a
slightly
rising
ground
it
was
a
picturesque
group
of
four
small
houses
three
of
tule
reeds
and
one
of
adobe
the
latter
a
comfortable
little
house
of
two
rooms
with
a
floor
and
a
shingled
roof
both
luxuries
in
san
pasquale
the
great
whose
luxuriance
and
size
were
noted
far
and
near
throughout
the
country
stood
down
the
slope
but
its
boughs
shaded
all
three
of
the
tule
houses
on
one
of
its
lower
branches
was
fastened
a
ingeniously
made
of
willow
wands
plastered
with
adobe
and
containing
so
many
rooms
that
the
whole
tree
seemed
sometimes
with
doves
and
dovelings
here
and
there
between
the
houses
were
huge
baskets
larger
than
barrels
woven
of
twigs
as
the
eagle
weaves
its
nest
only
tighter
and
thicker
these
were
the
outdoor
granaries
in
these
were
kept
acorns
barley
wheat
and
corn
ramona
thought
them
as
well
she
might
the
prettiest
things
she
ever
saw
are
they
hard
to
make
she
asked
can
you
make
them
alessandro
i
shall
want
all
you
want
my
majella
replied
alessandro
we
will
go
together
to
get
the
twigs
i
can
i
dare
say
buy
some
in
the
village
it
is
only
two
days
to
make
a
large
no
do
not
buy
one
she
exclaimed
i
wish
everything
in
our
house
to
be
made
by
in
which
again
ramona
was
unconsciously
striking
one
of
the
keynotes
of
pleasure
in
the
primitive
harmonies
of
existence
the
tule
house
which
stood
nearest
to
the
was
by
a
lucky
chance
now
empty
ysidro
brother
ramon
who
had
occupied
it
having
gone
with
his
wife
and
baby
to
san
bernardino
for
the
winter
to
work
this
house
ysidro
was
but
too
happy
to
give
to
alessandro
till
his
own
should
be
done
it
was
a
tiny
place
though
it
was
really
two
houses
joined
together
by
a
roofed
in
this
the
tidy
juana
ramon
wife
kept
her
few
pots
and
pans
and
a
small
stove
it
looked
to
ramona
like
a
timidly
alessandro
said
can
majella
live
in
this
small
place
for
a
time
it
will
not
be
very
long
there
are
adobes
already
his
countenance
cleared
as
ramona
replied
gleefully
i
think
it
will
be
very
comfortable
and
i
shall
feel
as
if
we
were
all
doves
together
in
the
majel
exclaimed
alessandro
and
that
was
all
he
said
only
a
few
rods
off
stood
the
little
chapel
in
front
of
it
swung
on
a
from
two
slanting
posts
an
old
bronze
bell
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
san
diego
mission
when
ramona
read
the
date
on
its
side
and
heard
that
it
was
from
the
san
diego
mission
church
it
had
come
she
felt
a
sense
of
protection
in
its
presence
think
alessandro
she
said
this
bell
no
doubt
has
rung
many
times
for
the
mass
for
the
holy
father
junipero
himself
it
is
a
blessing
to
the
village
i
want
to
live
where
i
can
see
it
all
the
time
it
will
be
like
a
saint
statue
in
the
with
every
allusion
that
ramona
made
to
the
saints
statues
alessandro
desire
to
procure
one
for
her
deepened
he
said
nothing
but
he
revolved
it
in
his
mind
continually
he
had
once
gone
with
his
shearers
to
san
fernando
and
there
he
had
seen
in
a
room
of
the
old
mission
buildings
a
dozen
statues
of
saints
huddled
in
dusty
confusion
the
san
fernando
church
was
in
crumbled
ruins
and
such
of
the
church
properties
as
were
left
there
were
in
the
keeping
of
a
mexican
not
and
not
in
the
least
devout
it
would
not
trouble
him
to
part
with
a
saint
or
two
alessandro
thought
and
no
irreverence
to
the
saint
either
on
the
contrary
the
greatest
of
reverence
since
the
statue
was
to
be
taken
from
a
place
where
no
one
cared
for
it
and
brought
into
one
where
it
would
be
tenderly
cherished
and
worshipped
every
day
if
only
san
fernando
were
not
so
far
away
and
the
wooden
saints
so
heavy
however
it
should
come
about
yet
majella
should
have
a
saint
nor
distance
nor
difficulty
should
keep
alessandro
from
procuring
for
his
majel
the
few
things
that
lay
within
his
power
but
he
held
his
peace
about
it
it
would
be
a
sweeter
gift
if
she
did
not
know
it
beforehand
he
pleased
himself
as
subtly
and
secretly
as
if
he
had
come
of
civilized
generations
thinking
how
her
eyes
would
dilate
if
she
waked
up
some
morning
and
saw
the
saint
by
her
bedside
and
how
sure
she
would
be
to
think
at
first
it
was
a
miracle
his
dear
devout
majella
who
with
all
her
superior
knowledge
was
yet
more
credulous
than
he
all
her
education
had
not
taught
her
to
think
as
he
untaught
had
learned
in
his
solitude
with
nature
before
alessandro
had
been
two
days
in
san
pasquale
he
had
heard
of
a
piece
of
which
almost
passed
his
belief
and
which
startled
him
for
once
out
of
his
usual
impassive
demeanor
you
know
i
have
a
herd
of
cattle
of
your
father
and
near
a
hundred
sheep
said
ysidro
holy
virgin
cried
alessandro
you
do
not
mean
that
how
is
that
they
told
me
all
our
stock
was
taken
by
the
yes
so
it
was
all
that
was
in
temecula
replied
ysidro
but
in
the
spring
your
father
sent
down
to
know
if
i
would
take
a
herd
for
him
up
into
the
mountains
with
ours
as
he
feared
the
temecula
pasture
would
fall
short
and
the
people
there
who
could
not
leave
must
have
their
cattle
near
home
so
he
sent
a
herd
over
i
think
near
fifty
head
and
many
of
the
cows
have
calved
and
he
sent
also
a
little
flock
of
sheep
a
hundred
ramon
said
he
herded
them
with
ours
all
summer
and
he
left
a
man
up
there
with
them
they
will
be
down
next
week
it
is
time
they
were
before
he
had
finished
speaking
alessandro
had
vanished
bounding
like
a
deer
ysidro
stared
after
him
but
seeing
him
enter
the
doorway
of
the
little
tule
hut
he
understood
and
a
sad
smile
passed
over
his
face
he
was
not
yet
persuaded
that
this
marriage
of
alessandro
would
turn
out
a
blessing
what
are
a
handful
of
sheep
to
her
he
thought
breathless
panting
alessandro
burst
into
ramona
presence
majella
my
majella
there
are
cattle
and
sheep
he
cried
the
saints
be
praised
we
are
not
like
the
beggars
as
i
i
told
you
that
god
would
give
us
food
dear
alessandro
replied
ramona
gently
you
do
not
wonder
you
do
not
ask
he
cried
astonished
at
her
calm
does
majella
think
that
a
sheep
or
a
steer
can
come
down
from
the
skies
nay
not
as
our
eyes
would
see
she
answered
but
the
holy
ones
who
live
in
the
skies
can
do
anything
they
like
on
the
earth
whence
came
these
cattle
and
how
are
they
ours
when
he
told
her
her
face
grew
solemn
do
you
remember
that
night
in
the
willows
she
said
when
i
was
like
one
dying
because
you
would
not
bring
me
with
you
you
had
no
faith
that
there
would
be
food
and
i
told
you
then
that
the
saints
never
forsook
those
who
loved
them
and
that
god
would
give
food
and
even
at
that
moment
when
you
did
not
know
it
there
were
your
cattle
and
your
sheep
feeding
in
the
mountains
in
the
keeping
of
god
will
my
alessandro
believe
after
this
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
it
is
true
said
alessandro
i
will
believe
after
this
that
the
saints
love
my
but
as
he
walked
at
a
slower
pace
back
to
ysidro
he
said
to
himself
majella
did
not
see
temecula
what
would
she
have
said
about
the
saints
if
she
had
seen
that
and
seen
the
people
dying
for
want
of
food
it
is
only
for
her
that
the
saints
pray
they
are
displeased
with
my
xx
one
year
and
a
half
of
another
year
had
passed
and
vintages
had
been
in
san
pasquale
and
alessandro
new
house
having
been
beaten
on
by
the
heavy
spring
rains
looked
no
longer
new
it
stood
on
the
south
side
of
the
valley
too
far
ramona
felt
from
the
blessed
bell
but
there
had
not
been
land
enough
for
any
nearer
and
she
could
see
the
chapel
and
the
posts
and
on
a
clear
day
the
bell
itself
the
house
was
small
small
to
hold
so
much
joy
she
said
when
alessandro
first
led
her
to
it
and
said
deprecatingly
it
is
small
majella
too
small
and
he
recollected
bitterly
as
he
spoke
the
size
of
ramona
own
room
at
the
senora
house
too
small
he
repeated
very
small
to
hold
so
much
joy
my
alessandro
she
laughed
but
quite
large
enough
to
hold
two
it
looked
like
a
palace
to
the
san
pasquale
people
after
ramona
had
arranged
their
little
possessions
in
it
and
she
herself
felt
rich
as
she
looked
around
her
two
small
rooms
the
old
san
luis
rey
chairs
and
the
bedstead
were
there
and
most
precious
of
all
the
statuette
of
the
madonna
for
this
alessandro
had
built
a
niche
in
the
wall
between
the
head
of
the
bed
and
the
one
window
the
niche
was
deep
enough
to
hold
small
pots
in
front
of
the
statuette
and
ramona
kept
constantly
growing
there
plants
which
wreathed
and
the
niche
till
it
looked
like
a
bower
below
it
hung
her
gold
rosary
and
the
ivory
christ
and
many
a
woman
of
the
village
when
she
came
to
see
ramona
asked
permission
to
go
into
the
bedroom
and
say
her
prayers
there
so
that
it
finally
came
to
be
a
sort
of
shrine
for
the
whole
village
a
broad
veranda
as
broad
as
the
senora
ran
across
the
front
of
the
little
house
this
was
the
only
thing
for
which
ramona
had
asked
she
could
not
quite
fancy
life
without
a
veranda
and
linnets
in
the
thatch
but
the
linnets
had
not
yet
come
in
vain
ramona
strewed
food
for
them
and
laid
little
trains
of
crumbs
to
lure
them
inside
the
posts
they
would
not
build
nests
inside
it
was
not
their
way
in
san
pasquale
they
lived
in
the
canons
but
this
part
of
the
valley
was
too
bare
of
trees
for
them
in
a
year
or
two
more
when
we
have
orchards
they
will
come
alessandro
said
with
the
money
from
that
first
and
from
the
sale
of
part
of
his
cattle
alessandro
had
bought
all
he
needed
in
the
way
of
farming
implements
a
good
wagon
and
harnesses
and
a
plough
baba
and
benito
at
first
restive
and
indignant
soon
made
up
their
minds
to
work
ramona
had
talked
to
baba
about
it
as
she
would
have
talked
to
a
brother
in
fact
except
for
ramona
help
it
would
have
been
a
question
whether
even
alessandro
could
have
made
baba
work
in
harness
good
baba
ramona
said
as
she
slipped
piece
after
piece
of
the
harness
over
his
neck
good
baba
you
must
help
us
we
have
so
much
work
to
do
and
you
are
so
strong
good
baba
do
you
love
me
and
with
one
hand
in
his
mane
and
her
cheek
every
few
steps
laid
close
to
his
she
led
baba
up
and
down
the
first
furrows
he
ploughed
my
senorita
thought
alessandro
to
himself
half
in
pain
half
in
pride
as
running
behind
with
the
unevenly
jerked
plough
he
watched
her
laughing
face
and
blowing
hair
my
senorita
but
ramona
would
not
run
with
her
hand
in
baba
mane
this
winter
there
was
a
new
work
for
her
indoors
in
a
rustic
cradle
which
alessandro
had
made
under
her
directions
of
the
woven
twigs
like
the
great
outdoor
only
closer
woven
and
of
an
oval
shape
and
lifted
from
the
floor
by
four
uprights
of
red
manzanita
stems
in
this
cradle
on
soft
white
wool
fleeces
covered
with
white
homespun
blankets
lay
ramona
baby
six
months
old
lusty
strong
and
beautiful
as
only
children
born
of
great
love
and
under
healthful
conditions
can
be
this
child
was
a
girl
to
alessandro
delight
to
ramona
regret
so
far
as
a
loving
mother
can
feel
regret
connected
with
her
firstborn
ramona
had
wished
for
an
alessandro
but
the
disappointed
wish
faded
out
of
her
thoughts
hour
by
hour
as
she
gazed
into
her
blue
eyes
eyes
so
blue
that
their
color
was
the
first
thing
noticed
by
each
person
who
looked
at
her
eyes
of
the
sky
exclaimed
ysidro
when
he
first
saw
her
like
the
mother
said
alessandro
on
which
ysidro
turned
an
astonished
look
upon
ramona
and
saw
for
the
first
time
that
her
eyes
too
were
blue
wonderful
he
said
it
is
so
i
never
saw
it
and
he
wondered
in
his
heart
what
father
it
had
been
who
had
given
eyes
like
those
to
one
born
of
an
indian
mother
eyes
of
the
sky
became
at
once
the
baby
name
in
the
village
and
alessandro
and
ramona
before
they
knew
it
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
so
calling
her
but
when
it
came
to
the
christening
they
demurred
the
news
was
brought
to
the
village
one
saturday
that
father
gaspara
would
hold
services
in
the
valley
the
next
day
and
that
he
wished
all
the
babes
to
be
brought
for
christening
late
into
the
night
alessandro
and
ramona
sat
by
their
sleeping
baby
and
discussed
what
should
be
her
name
ramona
wondered
that
alessandro
did
not
wish
to
name
her
majella
no
never
but
one
majella
he
said
in
a
tone
which
gave
ramona
a
sense
of
vague
fear
it
was
so
solemn
they
discussed
ramona
alessandro
suggested
carmena
this
had
been
his
mother
name
at
the
mention
of
it
ramona
shuddered
recollecting
the
scene
in
the
temecula
graveyard
oh
no
no
not
that
she
cried
it
is
and
alessandro
blamed
himself
for
having
forgotten
her
only
association
with
the
name
at
last
alessandro
said
the
people
have
named
her
i
think
majella
whatever
name
we
give
her
in
the
chapel
she
will
never
be
called
anything
but
of
the
sky
in
the
let
that
name
be
her
true
one
then
said
ramona
and
so
it
was
settled
and
when
father
gaspara
took
the
little
one
in
his
arms
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
her
brow
he
pronounced
with
some
difficulty
the
syllables
of
the
indian
name
which
meant
blue
eyes
or
eyes
of
the
heretofore
when
father
gaspara
had
come
to
san
pasquale
to
say
mass
he
had
slept
at
lomax
the
store
and
six
miles
away
in
the
bernardo
valley
but
ysidro
with
great
pride
had
this
time
ridden
to
meet
him
to
say
that
his
cousin
alessandro
who
had
come
to
live
in
the
valley
and
had
a
good
new
adobe
house
begged
that
the
father
would
do
him
the
honor
to
stay
with
him
and
indeed
father
added
ysidro
you
will
be
far
better
lodged
and
fed
than
in
the
house
of
lomax
my
cousin
wife
knows
well
how
all
should
be
alessandro
alessandro
said
the
father
musingly
has
he
been
long
married
no
father
answered
ysidro
but
little
more
than
two
years
they
were
married
by
you
on
their
way
from
temecula
ay
ay
i
remember
said
father
gaspara
i
will
come
and
it
was
with
no
small
interest
that
he
looked
forward
to
meeting
again
the
couple
that
had
so
strongly
impressed
him
ramona
was
full
of
eager
interest
in
her
preparations
for
entertaining
the
priest
this
was
like
the
olden
time
and
as
she
busied
herself
with
her
cooking
and
other
arrangements
the
thought
of
father
salvierderra
was
much
in
her
mind
she
could
perhaps
hear
news
of
him
from
father
gaspara
it
was
she
who
had
suggested
the
idea
to
alessandro
and
when
he
said
but
where
will
you
sleep
yourself
with
the
child
majella
if
we
give
our
room
to
the
father
i
can
lie
on
the
floor
outside
but
you
i
will
go
to
ysidro
and
sleep
with
juana
she
replied
for
two
nights
it
is
no
matter
and
it
is
such
shame
to
have
the
father
sleep
in
the
house
of
an
american
when
we
have
a
good
bed
like
this
seldom
in
his
life
had
alessandro
experienced
such
a
sense
of
gratification
as
he
did
when
he
led
father
gaspara
into
his
and
bedroom
the
clean
whitewashed
walls
the
bed
neatly
made
with
broad
lace
on
sheets
and
pillows
hung
with
curtains
and
a
canopy
of
bright
red
calico
the
old
carved
chairs
the
madonna
shrine
in
its
bower
of
green
leaves
the
shelves
on
the
walls
the
window
all
made
up
a
picture
such
as
father
gaspara
had
never
before
seen
in
his
pilgrimages
among
the
indian
villages
he
could
not
restrain
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
then
his
eye
falling
on
the
golden
rosary
he
exclaimed
where
got
you
that
it
is
my
wife
replied
alessandro
proudly
it
was
given
to
her
by
father
ah
said
the
father
he
died
the
other
dead
father
salvierderra
dead
cried
alessandro
that
will
be
a
terrible
blow
oh
father
i
implore
you
not
to
speak
of
it
in
her
presence
she
must
not
know
it
till
after
the
christening
it
will
make
her
heart
heavy
so
that
she
will
have
no
father
gaspara
was
still
scrutinizing
the
rosary
and
crucifix
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
he
said
absently
i
will
say
nothing
of
it
but
this
is
a
work
of
art
this
crucifix
do
you
know
what
you
have
here
and
this
is
this
not
an
he
added
lifting
up
the
beautiful
wrought
which
ramona
in
honor
of
his
coming
had
pinned
on
the
wall
below
the
madonna
shrine
yes
father
it
was
made
for
that
my
wife
made
it
it
was
to
be
a
present
to
father
salvierderra
but
she
has
not
seen
him
to
give
it
to
him
it
will
take
the
light
out
of
the
sun
for
her
when
first
she
hears
that
he
is
father
gaspara
was
about
to
ask
another
question
when
ramona
appeared
in
the
doorway
flushed
with
running
she
had
carried
the
baby
over
to
juana
and
left
her
there
that
she
might
be
free
to
serve
the
supper
i
pray
you
tell
her
not
said
alessandro
under
his
breath
but
it
was
too
late
seeing
the
father
with
her
rosary
in
his
hand
ramona
exclaimed
that
father
is
my
most
sacred
possession
it
once
belonged
to
father
peyri
of
san
luis
rey
and
he
gave
it
to
father
salvierderra
who
gave
it
to
me
know
you
father
salvierderra
i
was
hoping
to
hear
news
of
him
through
yes
i
knew
him
not
very
well
it
is
long
since
i
saw
him
stammered
father
gaspara
his
hesitancy
alone
would
not
have
told
ramona
the
truth
she
would
have
set
that
down
to
the
secular
indifference
or
hostility
to
the
franciscan
order
but
looking
at
alessandro
she
saw
terror
and
sadness
on
his
face
no
shadow
there
ever
escaped
her
eye
what
is
it
alessandro
she
exclaimed
is
it
something
about
father
salvierderra
is
he
ill
alessandro
shook
his
head
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
looking
from
one
to
the
other
seeing
the
confused
pain
in
both
their
faces
ramona
laying
both
her
hands
on
her
breast
in
the
expressive
gesture
she
had
learned
from
the
indian
women
cried
out
in
a
piteous
tone
you
will
not
tell
me
you
do
not
speak
then
he
is
dead
and
she
sank
on
her
knees
yes
my
daughter
he
is
dead
said
father
gaspara
more
tenderly
than
that
brusque
and
warlike
priest
often
spoke
he
died
a
month
ago
at
santa
barbara
i
am
grieved
to
have
brought
you
tidings
to
give
you
such
sorrow
but
you
must
not
mourn
for
him
he
was
very
feeble
and
he
longed
to
die
i
heard
he
could
no
longer
work
and
he
did
not
wish
to
ramona
had
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
the
father
words
were
only
a
confused
sound
in
her
ears
she
had
heard
nothing
after
the
words
a
month
she
remained
silent
and
motionless
for
some
moments
then
rising
without
speaking
a
word
or
looking
at
either
of
the
men
she
crossed
the
room
and
knelt
down
before
the
madonna
by
a
common
impulse
both
alessandro
and
father
gaspara
silently
left
the
room
as
they
stood
together
outside
the
door
the
father
said
i
would
go
back
to
if
it
were
not
so
late
i
like
not
to
be
here
when
your
wife
is
in
such
that
would
but
be
another
grief
father
said
alessandro
she
has
been
full
of
happiness
in
making
ready
for
you
she
is
very
strong
of
soul
it
is
she
who
makes
me
strong
often
and
not
i
who
give
strength
to
my
faith
but
the
man
is
right
thought
father
gaspara
a
later
when
with
a
calm
face
ramona
summoned
them
to
supper
he
did
not
know
as
alessandro
did
how
that
face
had
changed
in
the
it
wore
a
look
alessandro
had
never
seen
upon
it
almost
he
dreaded
to
speak
to
her
when
he
walked
by
her
side
later
in
the
evening
as
she
went
across
the
valley
to
fernando
house
he
ventured
to
mention
father
name
ramona
laid
her
hand
on
his
lips
i
can
not
talk
about
him
yet
dear
she
said
i
never
believed
that
he
would
die
without
giving
us
his
blessing
do
not
speak
of
him
till
is
ramona
saddened
face
smote
on
all
the
women
hearts
as
they
met
her
the
next
morning
one
by
one
they
gazed
astonished
then
turned
away
and
spoke
softly
among
themselves
they
all
loved
her
and
half
revered
her
too
for
her
great
kindness
and
readiness
to
teach
and
to
help
them
she
had
been
like
a
sort
of
missionary
in
the
valley
ever
since
she
came
and
no
one
had
ever
seen
her
face
without
a
smile
now
she
smiled
not
yet
there
was
the
beautiful
baby
in
its
white
dress
ready
to
be
christened
and
the
sun
shone
and
the
bell
had
been
ringing
for
half
an
hour
and
from
every
corner
of
the
valley
the
people
were
gathering
and
father
gaspara
in
his
gold
and
green
cassock
was
praying
before
the
altar
it
was
a
joyous
day
in
san
pasquale
why
did
alessandro
and
ramona
kneel
apart
in
a
corner
with
such
countenances
not
even
looking
glad
when
their
baby
laughed
and
reached
up
her
hands
gradually
it
was
whispered
about
what
had
happened
some
one
had
got
it
from
antonio
of
temecula
alessandro
friend
then
all
the
women
faces
grew
sad
too
they
all
had
heard
of
father
salvierderra
and
many
of
them
had
prayed
to
the
ivory
christ
in
ramona
room
and
knew
that
he
had
given
it
to
her
as
ramona
passed
out
of
the
chapel
some
of
them
came
up
to
her
and
taking
her
hand
in
theirs
laid
it
on
their
hearts
speaking
no
word
the
gesture
was
more
than
any
speech
could
have
been
when
father
gaspara
was
taking
leave
ramona
said
with
quivering
lips
father
if
there
is
anything
you
know
of
father
salvierderra
last
hours
i
would
be
grateful
to
you
for
telling
i
heard
very
little
replied
the
father
except
that
he
had
been
feeble
for
some
weeks
yet
he
would
persist
in
spending
most
of
the
night
kneeling
on
the
stone
floor
in
the
church
yes
interrupted
ramona
that
he
always
and
the
last
morning
continued
the
father
the
brothers
found
him
there
still
kneeling
on
the
stone
floor
but
quite
powerless
to
move
and
they
lifted
him
and
carried
him
to
his
room
and
there
they
found
to
their
horror
that
he
had
had
no
bed
he
had
lain
on
the
stones
and
then
they
took
him
to
the
superior
own
room
and
laid
him
in
the
bed
and
he
did
not
speak
any
more
and
at
noon
he
thank
you
very
much
father
said
ramona
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
ground
and
in
the
same
low
tremulous
tone
i
am
glad
that
i
know
that
he
is
strange
what
a
hold
those
franciscans
got
on
these
indians
mused
father
gaspara
as
he
rode
down
the
valley
there
none
of
them
would
look
like
that
if
i
were
dead
i
warrant
me
there
he
exclaimed
i
meant
to
have
asked
alessandro
who
this
wife
of
his
is
i
do
believe
she
is
a
temecula
indian
next
time
i
come
i
will
find
out
she
had
some
schooling
somewhere
that
plain
she
quite
superior
to
the
general
run
of
them
next
time
i
come
i
will
find
out
about
next
time
in
what
calendar
are
kept
the
records
of
those
next
times
which
never
come
long
before
father
gaspara
visited
san
pasquale
again
alessandro
and
ramona
were
far
away
and
strangers
were
living
in
their
home
it
seemed
to
ramona
in
after
years
as
she
looked
back
over
this
life
that
the
news
of
father
salvierderra
death
was
the
first
note
of
the
knell
of
their
happiness
it
was
but
a
few
days
afterward
when
alessandro
came
in
one
noon
with
an
expression
on
his
face
that
terrified
her
seating
himself
in
a
chair
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
would
neither
look
up
nor
speak
not
until
ramona
was
near
crying
from
his
silence
did
he
utter
a
word
then
looking
at
her
with
a
ghastly
face
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
it
has
begun
and
buried
his
face
again
finally
ramona
tears
wrung
from
him
the
following
story
ysidro
it
seemed
had
the
previous
year
rented
a
canon
at
the
head
of
the
valley
to
one
doctor
morong
it
was
simply
as
that
the
doctor
wanted
it
he
said
he
put
his
hives
there
and
built
a
sort
of
hut
for
the
man
whom
he
sent
up
to
look
after
the
honey
ysidro
did
not
need
the
land
and
thought
it
a
good
chance
to
make
a
little
money
he
had
taken
every
precaution
to
make
the
transaction
a
safe
one
had
gone
to
san
diego
and
got
father
gaspara
to
act
as
interpreter
for
him
in
the
interview
with
morong
it
had
been
a
written
agreement
and
the
rent
agreed
upon
had
been
punctually
paid
now
the
time
of
the
lease
having
expired
ysidro
had
been
to
san
diego
to
ask
the
doctor
if
he
wished
to
renew
it
for
another
year
and
the
doctor
had
said
that
the
land
was
his
and
he
was
coming
out
there
to
build
a
house
and
live
ysidro
had
gone
to
father
gaspara
for
help
and
father
gaspara
had
had
an
angry
interview
with
doctor
morong
but
it
had
done
no
good
the
doctor
said
the
land
did
not
belong
to
ysidro
at
all
but
to
the
united
states
government
and
that
he
had
paid
the
money
for
it
to
the
agents
in
los
angeles
and
there
would
very
soon
come
papers
from
washington
to
show
that
it
was
his
father
gaspara
had
gone
with
ysidro
to
a
lawyer
in
san
diego
and
had
shown
to
his
lawyer
ysidro
paper
the
old
one
from
the
mexican
governor
of
california
establishing
the
pueblo
of
san
pasquale
and
saying
how
many
leagues
of
land
the
indians
were
to
have
but
the
lawyer
had
only
laughed
at
father
gaspara
for
believing
that
such
a
paper
as
that
was
good
for
anything
he
said
that
was
all
very
well
when
the
country
belonged
to
mexico
but
it
was
no
good
now
that
the
americans
owned
it
now
and
everything
was
done
by
the
american
law
now
not
by
the
mexican
law
any
more
then
we
do
not
own
any
land
in
san
pasquale
at
all
said
ysidro
is
that
what
it
means
and
the
lawyer
had
said
he
did
not
know
how
it
would
be
with
the
cultivated
land
and
the
village
where
the
houses
were
he
could
not
tell
about
that
but
he
thought
it
all
belonged
to
the
men
at
washington
father
gaspara
was
in
such
rage
ysidro
said
that
he
tore
open
his
gown
on
his
breast
and
he
smote
himself
and
he
said
he
wished
he
were
a
soldier
and
no
priest
that
he
might
fight
this
accursed
united
states
government
and
the
lawyer
laughed
at
him
and
told
him
to
look
after
souls
that
was
his
business
and
let
the
indian
beggars
alone
yes
that
was
what
he
said
indian
beggars
and
so
they
would
be
all
beggars
alessandro
told
this
by
gasps
as
it
were
at
long
intervals
his
voice
was
choked
his
whole
frame
shook
he
was
nearly
beside
himself
with
rage
and
despair
you
see
it
is
as
i
said
majella
there
is
no
place
safe
we
can
do
nothing
we
might
better
be
dead
it
is
a
long
way
off
that
canon
doctor
morong
had
said
ramona
piteously
it
would
do
any
harm
his
living
there
if
no
more
majella
talks
like
a
dove
and
not
like
a
woman
said
alessandro
fiercely
will
there
be
one
to
come
and
not
two
it
is
the
beginning
may
come
ten
more
with
papers
to
show
that
the
land
is
theirs
we
can
do
nothing
any
more
than
the
wild
beasts
they
are
better
than
from
this
day
alessandro
was
a
changed
man
hope
had
died
in
his
bosom
in
all
the
village
councils
and
they
were
many
and
long
now
for
the
little
community
had
been
plunged
into
great
anxiety
and
distress
by
this
doctor
morong
affair
alessandro
sat
dumb
and
gloomy
to
whatever
was
proposed
he
had
but
one
reply
it
is
of
no
use
we
can
do
eat
your
dinners
we
starve
he
said
one
night
bitterly
as
the
council
broke
up
when
ysidro
proposed
to
him
that
they
should
journey
to
los
angeles
where
father
gaspara
had
said
the
headquarters
of
the
government
officers
were
and
where
they
could
learn
all
about
the
new
laws
in
regard
to
land
alessandro
laughed
at
him
what
more
is
it
then
which
you
wish
to
know
my
brother
about
the
american
laws
he
said
is
it
not
enough
that
you
know
they
have
made
a
law
which
will
take
the
land
from
indians
from
us
who
have
owned
it
longer
than
any
can
remember
land
that
our
ancestors
are
buried
in
will
take
that
land
and
give
it
to
themselves
and
say
it
is
theirs
is
it
to
hear
this
again
said
in
your
face
and
to
see
the
man
laugh
who
says
it
like
the
lawyer
in
san
diego
that
you
will
journey
to
los
angeles
i
will
not
go
and
ysidro
went
alone
father
gaspara
gave
him
a
letter
to
the
los
angeles
priest
who
went
with
him
to
the
patiently
interpreted
for
him
all
he
had
to
say
and
as
patiently
interpreted
all
that
the
officials
had
to
say
in
reply
they
did
not
laugh
as
alessandro
in
his
bitterness
had
said
they
were
not
inhuman
and
they
felt
sincere
sympathy
for
this
man
representative
of
two
hundred
industrious
people
in
danger
of
being
turned
out
of
house
and
home
but
they
were
very
busy
they
had
to
say
curtly
and
in
few
words
all
there
was
to
be
said
the
san
pasquale
district
was
certainly
the
property
of
the
united
states
government
and
the
lands
were
in
market
to
be
filed
on
and
bought
according
to
the
homestead
laws
these
officials
had
neither
authority
nor
option
in
the
matter
they
were
there
simply
to
carry
out
instructions
and
obey
orders
ysidro
understood
the
substance
of
all
this
though
the
details
were
beyond
his
comprehension
but
he
did
not
regret
having
taken
the
journey
he
had
now
made
his
last
effort
for
his
people
the
los
angeles
priest
had
promised
that
he
would
himself
write
a
letter
to
washington
to
lay
the
case
before
the
head
man
there
and
perhaps
something
would
be
done
for
their
relief
it
seemed
incredible
to
ysidro
as
riding
along
day
after
day
on
his
sad
homeward
journey
he
reflected
on
the
subject
it
seemed
incredible
to
him
that
the
government
would
permit
such
a
village
as
theirs
to
be
destroyed
he
reached
home
just
at
sunset
and
looking
down
as
alessandro
and
ramona
had
done
on
the
morning
of
their
arrival
from
the
hillcrests
at
the
west
end
of
the
valley
seeing
the
broad
belt
of
cultivated
fields
and
orchards
the
peaceful
little
hamlet
of
houses
he
groaned
if
the
people
who
make
these
laws
could
only
see
this
village
they
would
never
turn
us
out
never
they
ca
know
what
is
being
done
i
am
sure
they
ca
what
did
i
tell
you
cried
alessandro
galloping
up
on
benito
and
reining
him
in
so
sharply
he
reared
and
plunged
what
did
i
tell
you
i
saw
by
your
face
many
paces
back
that
you
had
come
as
you
went
or
worse
i
have
been
watching
for
you
these
two
days
another
american
has
come
in
with
morong
in
the
canon
they
are
making
corrals
they
will
keep
stock
you
will
see
how
long
we
have
any
in
that
end
of
the
valley
i
drive
all
my
stock
to
san
diego
next
week
i
will
sell
it
for
what
it
will
bring
both
the
cattle
and
the
sheep
it
is
no
use
you
will
when
ysidro
began
to
recount
his
interview
with
the
authorities
alessandro
broke
in
fiercely
i
wish
to
hear
no
more
of
it
their
names
and
their
speech
are
like
smoke
in
my
eyes
and
my
nose
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
ysidro
go
tell
your
story
to
the
men
who
are
waiting
to
hear
it
and
who
yet
believe
that
an
american
may
speak
truth
alessandro
was
as
good
as
his
word
the
very
next
week
he
drove
all
his
cattle
and
sheep
to
san
diego
and
sold
them
at
great
loss
it
is
better
than
nothing
he
said
they
will
not
now
be
sold
by
the
sheriff
like
my
father
in
the
money
he
got
he
took
to
father
gaspara
father
he
said
huskily
i
have
sold
all
my
stock
i
would
not
wait
for
the
americans
to
sell
it
for
me
and
take
the
money
i
have
not
got
much
but
it
is
better
than
nothing
it
will
make
that
we
do
not
starve
for
one
year
will
you
keep
it
for
me
father
i
dare
not
have
it
in
san
pasquale
san
pasquale
will
be
like
temecula
it
may
be
to
the
father
suggestion
that
he
should
put
the
money
in
a
bank
in
san
diego
alessandro
cried
sooner
would
i
throw
it
in
the
sea
yonder
i
trust
no
man
henceforth
only
the
church
i
will
trust
keep
it
for
me
father
i
pray
you
and
the
father
could
not
refuse
his
imploring
tone
what
are
your
plans
now
he
asked
plans
repeated
alessandro
plans
father
why
should
i
make
plans
i
will
stay
in
my
house
so
long
as
the
americans
will
let
me
you
saw
our
little
house
father
his
voice
broke
as
he
said
this
i
have
large
if
i
can
get
one
more
crop
off
them
it
will
be
something
but
my
land
is
of
the
richest
in
the
valley
and
as
soon
as
the
americans
see
it
they
will
want
it
farewell
father
i
thank
you
for
keeping
my
money
and
for
all
you
said
to
the
thief
morong
ysidro
told
me
and
he
was
gone
and
out
of
sight
on
the
swift
galloping
benito
before
father
gaspara
bethought
himself
and
i
remembered
not
to
ask
who
his
wife
was
i
will
look
back
at
the
record
said
the
father
taking
down
the
old
volume
he
ran
his
eye
back
over
the
year
marriages
were
not
so
many
in
father
parish
that
the
list
took
long
to
read
the
entry
of
marriage
was
blotted
the
father
had
been
in
haste
that
night
alessandro
assis
majella
fa
no
more
could
be
read
the
name
meant
nothing
to
father
gaspara
clearly
an
indian
name
he
said
to
himself
yet
she
seemed
superior
in
every
way
i
wonder
where
she
got
the
winter
wore
along
quietly
in
san
pasquale
the
delicious
soft
rains
set
in
early
promising
a
good
grain
year
it
seemed
a
pity
not
to
get
in
as
much
wheat
as
possible
and
all
the
san
pasquale
people
went
early
to
ploughing
new
fields
all
but
alessandro
if
i
reap
all
i
have
i
will
thank
the
saints
he
said
i
will
plough
no
more
land
for
the
but
after
his
fields
were
all
planted
and
the
beneficent
rains
still
kept
on
and
the
hills
all
along
the
valley
wall
began
to
turn
green
earlier
than
ever
before
was
known
he
said
to
ramona
one
morning
i
think
i
will
make
one
more
field
of
wheat
there
will
be
a
great
yield
this
year
maybe
we
will
be
left
unmolested
till
the
harvest
is
oh
yes
and
for
many
more
harvests
dear
alessandro
said
ramona
cheerily
you
are
always
looking
on
the
black
there
is
no
other
but
the
black
side
majella
he
replied
strain
my
eyes
as
i
may
on
all
sides
all
is
black
you
will
see
never
any
more
harvests
in
san
pasquale
for
us
after
this
if
we
get
this
we
are
lucky
i
have
seen
the
white
men
riding
up
and
down
in
the
valley
and
i
found
some
of
their
cursed
bits
of
wood
with
figures
on
them
set
up
on
my
land
the
other
day
and
i
pulled
them
up
and
burned
them
to
ashes
but
i
will
plough
one
more
field
this
week
though
i
know
not
why
it
is
my
thoughts
go
against
it
even
now
but
i
will
do
it
and
i
will
not
come
home
till
night
majella
for
the
field
is
too
far
to
go
and
come
twice
i
shall
be
the
whole
day
so
saying
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
baby
and
then
kissing
ramona
went
out
ramona
stood
at
the
door
and
watched
him
as
he
harnessed
benito
and
baba
to
the
plough
he
did
not
once
look
back
at
her
his
face
seemed
full
of
thought
his
hands
acting
as
it
were
mechanically
after
he
had
gone
a
few
rods
from
the
house
he
stopped
stood
still
for
some
minutes
meditatingly
then
went
on
irresolutely
halted
again
but
finally
went
on
and
disappeared
from
sight
among
the
low
foothills
to
the
east
sighing
deeply
ramona
turned
back
to
her
work
but
her
heart
was
too
disquieted
she
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
how
changed
is
alessandro
she
thought
it
terrifies
me
to
see
him
thus
i
will
tell
the
blessed
virgin
about
it
and
kneeling
before
the
shrine
she
prayed
fervently
and
long
she
rose
comforted
and
drawing
the
baby
cradle
out
into
the
veranda
seated
herself
at
her
embroidery
her
skill
with
her
needle
had
proved
a
not
inconsiderable
source
of
income
her
fine
being
always
taken
by
san
diego
merchants
and
at
fairly
good
prices
it
seemed
to
her
only
a
short
time
that
she
had
been
sitting
thus
when
glancing
up
at
the
sun
she
saw
it
was
near
noon
at
the
same
moment
she
saw
alessandro
approaching
with
the
horses
in
dismay
she
thought
there
is
no
dinner
he
said
he
would
not
come
and
springing
up
was
about
to
run
to
meet
him
when
she
observed
that
he
was
not
alone
a
short
man
was
walking
by
his
side
they
were
talking
earnestly
it
was
a
white
man
what
did
it
bode
presently
they
stopped
she
saw
alessandro
lift
his
hand
and
point
to
the
house
then
to
the
tule
sheds
in
the
rear
he
seemed
to
be
talking
excitedly
the
white
man
also
they
were
both
speaking
at
once
ramona
shivered
with
fear
motionless
she
stood
straining
eye
and
ear
she
could
hear
nothing
but
the
gestures
told
much
had
it
come
the
thing
alessandro
had
said
would
come
were
they
to
be
driven
out
driven
out
this
very
day
when
the
virgin
had
only
just
now
seemed
to
promise
her
help
and
protection
the
baby
stirred
waked
began
to
cry
catching
the
child
up
to
her
breast
she
stilled
her
by
convulsive
caresses
clasping
her
tight
in
her
arms
she
walked
a
few
steps
towards
alessandro
who
seeing
her
made
an
imperative
gesture
to
her
to
return
sick
at
heart
she
went
back
to
the
veranda
and
sat
down
to
wait
in
a
few
moments
she
saw
the
white
man
counting
out
money
into
alessandro
hand
then
he
turned
and
walked
away
alessandro
still
standing
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
gazing
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
benito
and
baba
slowly
walking
away
from
him
unnoticed
at
last
he
seemed
to
rouse
himself
as
from
a
trance
and
picking
up
the
reins
came
slowly
toward
her
again
she
started
to
meet
him
again
he
made
the
same
authoritative
gesture
to
her
to
return
and
again
she
seated
herself
trembling
in
every
nerve
of
her
body
ramona
was
now
sometimes
afraid
of
alessandro
when
these
fierce
glooms
seized
him
she
dreaded
she
knew
not
what
he
seemed
no
more
the
alessandro
she
had
loved
deliberately
lingeringly
he
unharnessed
the
horses
and
put
them
in
the
corral
then
still
more
deliberately
lingeringly
he
walked
to
the
house
walked
without
speaking
past
ramona
into
the
door
a
lurid
spot
on
each
cheek
showed
burning
red
through
the
bronze
of
his
skin
his
eyes
glittered
in
silence
ramona
followed
him
and
saw
him
draw
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
fling
them
on
the
table
and
burst
into
a
laugh
more
terrible
than
any
weeping
a
laugh
which
wrung
from
her
instantly
involuntarily
the
cry
oh
my
alessandro
my
alessandro
what
is
it
are
you
mad
no
my
sweet
majel
he
exclaimed
turning
to
her
and
flinging
his
arms
round
her
and
the
child
together
drawing
them
so
close
to
his
breast
that
the
embrace
hurt
no
i
am
not
mad
but
i
think
i
shall
soon
be
what
is
that
gold
the
price
of
this
house
majel
and
of
the
fields
of
all
that
was
ours
in
san
pasquale
we
will
go
out
into
the
world
again
i
will
see
if
i
can
find
a
place
the
americans
do
not
want
it
did
not
take
many
words
to
tell
the
story
alessandro
had
not
been
ploughing
more
than
an
hour
when
hearing
a
strange
sound
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
man
unloading
lumber
a
few
rods
off
alessandro
stopped
midway
in
the
furrow
and
watched
him
the
man
also
watched
alessandro
presently
he
came
toward
him
and
said
roughly
look
here
be
off
will
you
this
is
my
land
i
going
to
build
a
house
alessandro
had
replied
this
was
my
land
yesterday
how
comes
it
yours
something
in
the
wording
of
this
answer
or
something
in
tone
and
bearing
smote
the
man
conscience
or
heart
or
what
stood
to
him
in
the
place
of
conscience
and
heart
and
he
said
come
now
my
good
fellow
you
look
like
a
reasonable
kind
of
a
fellow
you
just
clear
out
will
you
and
not
make
me
any
trouble
you
see
the
land
mine
i
got
all
this
land
round
here
and
he
waved
his
arm
describing
a
circle
three
hundred
and
twenty
acres
me
and
my
brother
together
and
we
coming
in
here
to
settle
we
got
our
papers
from
washington
last
week
it
all
right
and
you
may
just
as
well
go
peaceably
as
make
a
fuss
about
it
do
you
see
yes
alessandro
saw
he
had
been
seeing
this
precise
thing
for
months
many
times
in
his
dreams
and
in
his
waking
thoughts
he
had
lived
over
scenes
similar
to
this
an
almost
preternatural
calm
and
wisdom
seemed
to
be
given
him
now
yes
i
see
senor
he
said
i
am
not
surprised
i
knew
it
would
come
but
i
hoped
it
would
not
be
till
after
harvest
i
will
not
give
you
any
trouble
senor
because
i
can
not
if
i
could
i
would
but
i
have
heard
all
about
the
new
law
which
gives
all
the
indians
lands
to
the
americans
we
can
not
help
ourselves
but
it
is
very
hard
he
paused
the
man
confused
and
embarrassed
astonished
beyond
expression
at
being
met
in
this
way
by
an
indian
did
not
find
words
come
ready
to
his
tongue
of
course
i
know
it
does
seem
a
little
rough
on
fellows
like
you
that
are
industrious
and
have
done
some
work
on
the
land
but
you
see
the
land
in
the
market
i
paid
my
money
for
the
senor
is
going
to
build
a
house
asked
alessandro
yes
the
man
answered
i
got
my
family
in
san
diego
and
i
want
to
get
them
settled
as
soon
as
i
can
my
wife
wo
feel
comfortable
till
she
in
her
own
house
we
from
the
states
and
she
been
used
to
having
everything
i
have
a
wife
and
child
senor
said
alessandro
still
in
the
same
calm
deliberate
tone
and
we
have
a
very
good
house
of
two
rooms
it
would
save
the
senor
building
if
he
would
buy
how
far
is
it
said
the
man
i
ca
tell
exactly
where
the
boundaries
of
my
land
are
for
the
stakes
we
set
have
been
pulled
yes
senor
i
pulled
them
up
and
burned
them
they
were
on
my
land
replied
alessandro
my
house
is
farther
west
than
your
stakes
and
i
have
large
there
too
many
acres
senor
all
here
was
a
chance
indeed
the
man
eyes
gleamed
he
would
do
the
handsome
thing
he
would
give
this
fellow
something
for
his
house
and
first
he
would
see
the
house
however
and
it
was
for
that
purpose
he
had
walked
back
with
alessandro
when
he
saw
the
neat
whitewashed
adobe
with
its
broad
veranda
the
sheds
and
corrals
all
in
good
order
he
instantly
resolved
to
get
possession
of
them
by
fair
means
or
foul
there
will
be
three
hundred
dollars
worth
of
wheat
in
july
senor
you
can
see
for
yourself
and
a
house
so
good
as
that
you
can
not
build
for
less
than
one
hundred
dollars
what
will
you
give
me
for
them
i
suppose
i
can
have
them
without
paying
you
for
them
if
i
choose
said
the
man
insolently
no
senor
replied
alessandro
what
to
hinder
then
i
like
to
know
in
a
brutal
sneer
you
have
got
any
rights
here
whatever
according
to
i
shall
hinder
senor
replied
alessandro
i
shall
burn
down
the
sheds
and
corrals
tear
down
the
house
and
before
a
blade
of
the
wheat
is
reaped
i
will
burn
still
in
the
same
calm
tone
what
you
take
said
the
man
sullenly
two
hundred
dollars
replied
alessandro
well
leave
your
plough
and
wagon
and
i
give
it
to
you
said
the
man
and
a
big
fool
i
am
too
well
laughed
at
i
be
do
you
know
it
for
buying
out
an
indian
the
wagon
senor
cost
me
one
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
in
san
diego
you
can
not
buy
one
so
good
for
less
i
will
not
sell
it
i
need
it
to
take
away
my
things
in
the
plough
you
may
have
that
is
worth
i
do
it
said
the
man
and
pulling
out
a
heavy
buckskin
pouch
he
counted
out
into
alessandro
hand
two
hundred
dollars
in
gold
is
that
all
right
he
said
as
he
put
down
the
last
piece
that
is
the
sum
i
said
senor
replied
alessandro
tomorrow
at
noon
you
can
come
into
the
where
will
you
go
asked
the
man
again
slightly
touched
by
alessandro
manner
why
do
you
stay
round
here
i
expect
you
could
get
work
enough
there
are
a
lot
of
farmers
coming
in
here
they
want
a
fierce
torrent
of
words
sprang
to
alessandro
lips
but
he
choked
them
back
i
do
not
know
where
i
shall
go
but
i
will
not
stay
here
he
said
and
that
ended
the
interview
i
do
know
as
i
blame
him
a
mite
for
feeling
that
way
thought
the
man
from
the
states
as
he
walked
slowly
back
to
his
pile
of
lumber
i
expect
i
should
feel
just
so
almost
before
alessandro
had
finished
this
tale
he
began
to
move
about
the
room
taking
down
folding
up
opening
and
shutting
lids
his
restlessness
was
terrible
to
see
by
sunrise
i
would
like
to
be
off
he
said
it
is
like
death
to
be
in
the
house
which
is
no
longer
ramona
had
spoken
no
words
since
her
first
cry
on
hearing
that
terrible
laugh
she
was
like
one
stricken
dumb
the
shock
was
greater
to
her
than
to
alessandro
he
had
lived
with
it
ever
present
in
his
thoughts
for
a
year
she
had
always
hoped
but
far
more
dreadful
than
the
loss
of
her
home
was
the
anguish
of
seeing
hearing
the
changed
face
changed
voice
of
alessandro
almost
this
swallowed
up
the
other
she
obeyed
him
mechanically
working
faster
and
faster
as
he
grew
more
and
more
feverish
in
his
haste
before
sundown
the
little
house
was
dismantled
everything
except
the
bed
and
the
stove
packed
in
the
big
wagon
now
we
must
cook
food
for
the
journey
said
alessandro
where
are
we
going
said
the
weeping
ramona
where
ejaculated
alessandro
so
scornfully
that
it
sounded
like
impatience
with
ramona
and
made
her
tears
flow
afresh
where
i
know
not
majella
into
the
mountains
where
the
white
men
come
not
at
sunrise
we
will
ramona
wished
to
say
to
their
friends
there
were
women
in
the
village
that
she
tenderly
loved
but
alessandro
was
unwilling
there
will
be
weeping
and
crying
majella
i
pray
you
do
not
speak
to
one
why
should
we
have
more
tears
let
us
disappear
i
will
say
all
to
ysidro
he
will
tell
this
was
a
sore
grief
to
ramona
in
her
heart
she
rebelled
against
it
as
she
had
never
yet
rebelled
against
an
act
of
alessandro
but
she
could
not
distress
him
was
not
his
burden
heavy
enough
now
without
a
word
of
farewell
to
any
one
they
set
off
in
the
gray
dawn
before
a
creature
was
stirring
in
the
village
the
wagon
piled
high
ramona
her
baby
in
her
arms
in
front
alessandro
walking
the
load
was
heavy
benito
and
baba
walked
slowly
capitan
unhappy
looking
first
at
ramona
face
then
at
alessandro
walked
dispiritedly
by
their
side
he
knew
all
was
wrong
as
alessandro
turned
the
horses
into
a
faintly
marked
road
leading
in
a
northeasterly
direction
ramona
said
with
a
sob
where
does
this
road
lead
alessandro
to
san
jacinto
he
said
san
jacinto
mountain
do
not
look
back
majella
do
not
look
back
he
cried
as
he
saw
ramona
with
streaming
eyes
gazing
back
towards
san
pasquale
do
not
look
back
it
is
gone
pray
to
the
saints
now
majella
pray
pray
xxi
the
senora
moreno
was
dying
it
had
been
a
sad
two
years
in
the
moreno
house
after
the
first
excitement
following
ramona
departure
had
died
away
things
had
settled
down
in
a
surface
similitude
of
their
old
routine
but
nothing
was
really
the
same
no
one
was
so
happy
as
before
juan
canito
was
there
had
been
set
over
him
the
very
mexican
whose
coming
to
the
place
he
had
dreaded
the
sheep
had
not
done
well
there
had
been
a
drought
many
had
died
of
hunger
a
thing
for
which
the
new
mexican
overseer
was
not
to
blame
though
it
pleased
juan
to
hold
him
so
and
to
say
from
morning
till
night
that
if
his
leg
had
not
been
broken
or
if
the
lad
alessandro
had
been
there
the
would
have
been
as
big
as
ever
not
one
of
the
servants
liked
this
mexican
he
had
a
sorry
time
of
it
poor
fellow
each
man
and
woman
on
the
place
had
or
fancied
some
reason
for
being
set
against
him
some
from
sympathy
with
juan
can
some
from
idleness
and
general
impatience
margarita
most
of
all
because
he
was
not
alessandro
margarita
between
remorse
about
her
young
mistress
and
pique
and
disappointment
about
alessandro
had
become
a
very
unhappy
girl
and
her
mother
instead
of
comforting
or
soothing
her
added
to
her
misery
by
continually
bemoaning
ramona
fate
the
void
that
ramona
had
left
in
the
whole
household
seemed
an
irreparable
one
nothing
came
to
fill
it
there
was
no
forgetting
every
day
her
name
was
mentioned
by
some
one
mentioned
with
bated
breath
fearful
conjecture
compassion
and
regret
where
had
she
vanished
had
she
indeed
gone
to
the
convent
as
she
said
or
had
she
fled
with
alessandro
margarita
would
have
given
her
right
hand
to
know
only
juan
can
felt
sure
very
well
juan
can
knew
that
nobody
but
alessandro
had
the
wit
and
the
power
over
baba
to
lure
him
out
of
that
corral
and
never
a
rail
out
of
its
and
the
saddle
too
ay
the
smart
lad
he
had
done
the
best
he
could
for
the
senorita
but
holy
virgin
what
had
got
into
the
senorita
to
run
off
like
that
with
an
indian
even
alessandro
the
fiends
had
bewitched
her
tirelessly
juan
can
questioned
every
traveller
every
wandering
herder
he
saw
no
one
knew
anything
of
alessandro
beyond
the
fact
that
all
the
temecula
indians
had
been
driven
out
of
their
village
and
that
there
was
now
not
an
indian
in
the
valley
there
was
a
rumor
that
alessandro
and
his
father
had
both
died
but
no
one
knew
anything
certainly
the
temecula
indians
had
disappeared
that
was
all
there
was
of
it
disappeared
like
any
wild
creatures
foxes
or
coyotes
hunted
down
driven
out
the
valley
was
rid
of
them
but
the
senorita
she
was
not
with
these
fugitives
that
could
not
be
heaven
forbid
if
i
my
legs
i
go
and
see
for
said
juan
can
it
would
be
some
comfort
to
know
even
the
worst
perdition
take
the
senora
who
drove
her
to
it
ay
drove
her
to
it
that
what
i
say
in
some
of
his
most
venturesome
wrathy
moments
he
would
say
there
none
of
you
know
the
truth
about
the
senorita
but
me
it
a
hard
hand
the
senora
reared
her
with
from
the
first
she
a
wonderful
woman
our
senora
she
gets
power
over
but
the
senora
power
was
shaken
now
more
changed
than
all
else
in
the
changed
moreno
household
was
the
relation
between
the
senora
moreno
and
her
son
felipe
on
the
morning
after
ramona
disappearance
words
had
been
spoken
by
each
which
neither
would
ever
forget
in
fact
the
senora
believed
that
it
was
of
them
she
was
dying
and
perhaps
that
was
not
far
from
the
truth
the
reason
that
forces
could
no
longer
rally
in
her
to
repel
disease
lying
no
doubt
largely
in
the
fact
that
to
live
seemed
no
longer
to
her
desirable
felipe
had
found
the
note
ramona
had
laid
on
his
bed
before
it
was
yet
dawn
he
had
waked
and
tossing
uneasily
under
the
light
covering
had
heard
the
rustle
of
the
paper
and
knowing
instinctively
that
it
was
from
ramona
had
risen
instantly
to
make
sure
of
it
before
his
mother
opened
her
window
he
had
read
it
he
felt
like
one
bereft
of
his
senses
as
he
read
gone
gone
with
alessandro
stolen
away
like
a
thief
in
the
night
his
dear
sweet
little
sister
ah
what
a
cruel
shame
scales
seemed
to
drop
from
felipe
eyes
as
he
lay
motionless
thinking
of
it
a
shame
a
cruel
shame
and
he
and
his
mother
were
the
ones
who
had
brought
it
on
ramona
head
and
on
the
house
of
moreno
felipe
felt
as
if
he
had
been
under
a
spell
all
along
not
to
have
realized
this
that
what
i
told
my
mother
he
groaned
that
it
drove
her
to
running
away
oh
my
sweet
ramona
what
will
become
of
her
i
will
go
after
them
and
bring
them
back
and
felipe
rose
and
hastily
dressing
himself
ran
down
the
veranda
steps
to
gain
a
little
more
time
to
think
he
returned
shortly
to
meet
his
mother
standing
in
the
doorway
with
pale
affrighted
face
felipe
she
cried
ramona
is
not
i
know
it
he
replied
in
an
angry
tone
that
is
what
i
told
you
we
should
do
drive
her
to
running
away
with
alessandro
with
alessandro
interrupted
the
senora
yes
continued
felipe
with
alessandro
the
indian
perhaps
you
think
it
is
less
disgrace
to
the
names
of
ortegna
and
moreno
to
have
her
run
away
with
him
than
to
be
married
to
him
here
under
our
roof
i
do
not
curse
the
day
i
say
when
i
ever
lent
myself
to
breaking
the
girl
heart
i
am
going
after
them
to
fetch
them
back
if
the
skies
had
opened
and
rained
fire
the
senora
had
hardly
less
quailed
and
wondered
than
she
did
at
these
words
but
even
for
fire
from
the
skies
she
would
not
surrender
till
she
must
how
know
you
that
it
is
with
alessandro
she
said
because
she
has
written
it
here
cried
felipe
defiantly
holding
up
his
little
note
she
left
this
her
to
me
bless
her
she
writes
like
a
saint
to
thank
me
for
all
my
goodness
to
her
i
who
drove
her
to
steal
out
of
my
house
like
a
thief
the
phrase
my
house
smote
the
senora
ear
like
a
note
from
some
other
sphere
which
indeed
it
was
from
the
new
world
into
which
felipe
had
been
in
an
hour
born
her
cheeks
flushed
and
she
opened
her
lips
to
reply
but
before
she
had
uttered
a
word
luigo
came
running
round
the
corner
juan
can
hobbling
after
him
at
a
miraculous
pace
on
his
crutches
senor
felipe
senor
felipe
oh
senora
they
cried
thieves
have
been
here
in
the
night
baba
is
gone
baba
and
the
a
malicious
smile
broke
over
the
senora
countenance
and
turning
to
felipe
she
said
in
a
tone
what
a
tone
it
was
felipe
felt
as
if
he
must
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
to
shut
it
out
felipe
would
never
forget
as
you
were
saying
like
a
thief
in
the
night
with
a
swifter
and
more
energetic
movement
than
any
had
ever
before
seen
senor
felipe
make
he
stepped
forward
saying
in
an
undertone
to
his
mother
for
god
sake
mother
not
a
word
before
the
men
what
is
that
you
say
luigo
baba
gone
we
must
see
to
our
corral
i
will
come
down
after
breakfast
and
look
at
it
and
turning
his
back
on
them
he
drew
his
mother
by
a
firm
grasp
she
could
not
resist
into
the
house
she
gazed
at
him
in
sheer
dumb
wonder
ay
mother
he
said
you
may
well
look
thus
in
wonder
i
have
been
no
man
to
let
my
i
care
not
what
blood
were
in
her
veins
be
driven
to
this
pass
i
will
set
out
this
day
and
bring
her
the
day
you
do
that
then
i
lie
in
this
house
dead
retorted
the
senora
at
white
heat
you
may
rear
as
many
indian
families
as
you
please
under
the
moreno
roof
i
will
at
least
have
my
grave
in
spite
of
her
anger
grief
convulsed
her
and
in
another
second
she
had
burst
into
tears
and
sunk
helpless
and
trembling
into
a
chair
no
counterfeiting
now
no
pretences
the
senora
moreno
heart
broke
within
her
when
those
words
passed
her
lips
to
her
adored
felipe
at
the
sight
felipe
flung
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
he
kissed
the
aged
hands
as
they
lay
trembling
in
her
lap
mother
mia
he
cried
you
will
break
my
heart
if
you
speak
like
that
oh
why
why
do
you
command
me
to
do
what
a
man
may
not
i
would
die
for
you
my
mother
but
how
can
i
see
my
sister
a
homeless
wanderer
in
the
wilderness
i
suppose
the
man
alessandro
has
something
he
calls
a
home
said
the
senora
regaining
herself
a
little
had
they
no
plans
spoke
she
not
in
her
letter
of
what
they
would
do
only
that
they
would
go
to
father
salvierderra
first
he
replied
ah
the
senora
reflected
at
first
startled
her
second
thought
was
that
this
would
be
the
best
possible
thing
which
could
happen
father
salvierderra
will
counsel
them
what
to
do
she
said
he
could
no
doubt
establish
them
in
santa
barbara
in
some
way
my
son
when
you
reflect
you
will
see
the
impossibility
of
bringing
them
here
help
them
in
any
way
you
like
but
do
not
bring
them
she
paused
not
until
i
am
dead
felipe
it
will
not
be
felipe
bowed
his
head
in
his
mother
lap
she
laid
her
hands
on
his
hair
and
stroked
it
with
passionate
tenderness
my
felipe
she
said
it
was
a
cruel
fate
to
rob
me
of
you
at
the
last
mother
mother
he
cried
in
anguish
i
am
yours
wholly
devotedly
yours
why
do
you
torture
me
thus
i
will
not
torture
you
more
she
said
wearily
in
a
feeble
tone
i
ask
only
one
thing
of
you
let
me
never
hear
again
the
name
of
that
wretched
girl
who
has
brought
all
this
woe
on
our
house
let
her
name
never
be
spoken
on
this
place
by
man
woman
or
child
like
a
thief
in
the
night
ay
a
felipe
sprang
to
his
feet
he
said
baba
was
ramona
own
i
myself
gave
him
to
her
as
soon
as
he
was
born
the
senora
made
no
reply
she
had
fainted
calling
the
maids
in
terror
and
sorrow
felipe
bore
her
to
her
bed
and
she
did
not
leave
it
for
many
days
she
seemed
hovering
between
life
and
death
felipe
watched
over
her
as
a
lover
might
her
great
mournful
eyes
followed
his
every
motion
she
spoke
little
partly
because
of
physical
weakness
partly
from
despair
the
senora
had
got
her
she
would
die
hard
it
would
take
long
yet
she
was
dying
and
she
knew
it
felipe
did
not
know
it
when
he
saw
her
going
about
again
with
a
step
only
a
little
slower
than
before
and
with
a
countenance
not
so
much
changed
as
he
had
feared
he
thought
she
would
be
well
again
after
a
time
and
now
he
would
go
in
search
of
ramona
how
he
hoped
he
should
find
them
in
santa
barbara
he
must
leave
them
there
or
wherever
he
should
find
them
never
again
would
he
for
a
moment
contemplate
the
possibility
of
bringing
them
home
with
him
but
he
would
see
them
help
them
if
need
be
ramona
should
not
feel
herself
an
outcast
so
long
as
he
lived
when
he
said
agitatedly
to
his
mother
one
night
you
are
so
strong
now
mother
i
think
i
will
take
a
journey
i
will
not
be
away
long
not
over
a
week
she
understood
and
with
a
deep
sigh
replied
i
am
not
strong
but
i
am
as
strong
as
i
shall
ever
be
if
the
journey
must
be
taken
it
is
as
well
done
how
was
the
senora
changed
it
must
be
mother
said
felipe
or
i
would
not
leave
you
i
will
set
off
before
sunrise
so
i
will
say
farewell
but
in
the
morning
at
his
first
step
his
mother
window
opened
and
there
she
stood
wan
speechless
looking
at
him
you
must
go
my
son
she
asked
at
last
i
must
mother
and
felipe
threw
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
dearest
mother
do
smile
can
you
not
no
my
son
i
can
not
farewell
the
saints
keep
you
and
she
turned
that
she
might
not
see
him
go
felipe
rode
away
with
a
sad
heart
but
his
purpose
did
not
falter
following
straight
down
the
river
road
to
the
sea
he
then
kept
up
along
the
coast
asking
here
and
there
cautiously
if
persons
answering
to
the
description
of
alessandro
and
ramona
had
been
seen
no
one
had
seen
any
such
persons
when
on
the
night
of
the
second
day
he
rode
up
to
the
santa
barbara
mission
the
first
figure
he
saw
was
the
venerable
father
salvierderra
sitting
in
the
corridor
as
felipe
approached
the
old
man
face
beamed
with
pleasure
and
he
came
forward
totteringly
leaning
on
a
staff
in
each
hand
welcome
my
son
he
said
are
all
well
you
find
me
very
feeble
just
now
my
legs
are
failing
me
sorely
this
dismay
seized
on
felipe
at
the
father
first
words
he
would
not
have
spoken
thus
had
he
seen
ramona
barely
replying
to
the
greeting
felipe
exclaimed
father
i
come
seeking
ramona
has
she
not
been
with
you
father
salvierderra
face
was
reply
to
the
question
ramona
he
cried
seeking
ramona
what
has
befallen
the
blessed
child
it
was
a
bitter
story
for
felipe
to
tell
but
he
told
it
sparing
himself
no
shame
he
would
have
suffered
less
in
the
telling
had
he
known
how
well
father
salvierderra
understood
his
mother
character
and
her
almost
unlimited
power
over
all
persons
around
her
father
salvierderra
was
not
shocked
at
the
news
of
ramona
attachment
for
alessandro
he
regretted
it
but
he
did
not
think
it
shame
as
the
senora
had
done
as
felipe
talked
with
him
he
perceived
even
more
clearly
how
bitter
and
unjust
his
mother
had
been
to
alessandro
he
is
a
noble
young
man
said
father
salvierderra
his
father
was
one
of
the
most
trusted
of
father
peyri
assistants
you
must
find
them
felipe
i
wonder
much
they
did
not
come
to
me
perhaps
they
may
yet
come
when
you
find
them
bear
them
my
blessing
and
say
that
i
wish
they
would
come
hither
i
would
like
to
give
them
my
blessing
before
i
die
felipe
i
shall
never
leave
santa
barbara
again
my
time
draws
felipe
was
so
full
of
impatience
to
continue
his
search
that
he
hardly
listened
to
the
father
words
i
will
not
tarry
he
said
i
can
not
rest
till
i
find
her
i
will
ride
back
as
far
as
ventura
you
will
send
me
word
by
a
messenger
when
you
find
them
said
the
father
god
grant
no
harm
has
befallen
them
i
will
pray
for
them
felipe
and
he
tottered
into
the
church
felipe
thoughts
as
he
retraced
his
road
were
full
of
bewilderment
and
pain
he
was
wholly
at
loss
to
conjecture
what
course
alessandro
and
ramona
had
taken
or
what
could
have
led
them
to
abandon
their
intention
of
going
to
father
salvierderra
temecula
seemed
the
only
place
now
to
look
for
them
and
yet
from
temecula
felipe
had
heard
only
a
few
days
before
leaving
home
that
there
was
not
an
indian
left
in
the
valley
but
he
could
at
least
learn
there
where
the
indians
had
gone
poor
as
the
clew
seemed
it
was
all
he
had
cruelly
felipe
urged
his
horse
on
his
return
journey
he
grudged
an
hour
rest
to
himself
or
to
the
beast
and
before
he
reached
the
head
of
the
temecula
canon
the
creature
was
near
spent
at
the
steepest
part
he
jumped
off
and
walked
to
save
her
strength
as
he
was
toiling
slowly
up
a
narrow
rocky
pass
he
suddenly
saw
an
indian
head
peering
over
the
ledge
he
made
signs
to
him
to
come
down
the
indian
turned
his
head
and
spoke
to
some
one
behind
one
after
another
a
score
of
figures
rose
they
made
signs
to
felipe
to
come
up
poor
things
he
thought
they
are
he
shouted
to
them
that
his
horse
was
too
tired
to
climb
that
wall
but
if
they
would
come
down
he
would
give
them
money
holding
up
a
they
consulted
among
themselves
presently
they
began
slowly
descending
still
halting
at
intervals
and
looking
suspiciously
at
him
he
held
up
the
gold
again
and
beckoned
as
soon
as
they
could
see
his
face
distinctly
they
broke
into
a
run
that
was
no
enemy
face
only
one
of
the
number
could
speak
spanish
on
hearing
this
man
reply
to
felipe
first
question
a
woman
who
had
listened
sharply
and
caught
the
word
alessandro
came
forward
and
spoke
rapidly
in
the
indian
tongue
this
woman
has
seen
alessandro
said
the
man
where
said
felipe
breathlessly
in
temecula
two
weeks
ago
he
said
ask
her
if
he
had
any
one
with
him
said
felipe
no
said
the
woman
he
was
a
convulsion
passed
over
felipe
face
alone
what
did
this
mean
he
reflected
the
woman
watched
him
is
she
sure
he
was
alone
there
was
no
one
with
him
was
he
riding
a
big
black
horse
no
a
white
horse
answered
the
woman
promptly
a
small
white
it
was
carmena
every
nerve
of
her
loyal
nature
on
the
alert
to
baffle
this
pursuer
of
alessandro
and
ramona
again
felipe
reflected
ask
her
if
she
saw
him
for
any
length
of
time
how
long
she
saw
all
night
he
answered
he
spent
the
night
where
she
felipe
despaired
does
she
know
where
he
is
now
he
asked
he
was
going
to
san
luis
obispo
to
go
in
a
ship
to
what
to
do
she
does
not
did
he
say
when
he
would
come
back
when
never
he
said
he
would
never
set
foot
in
temecula
does
she
know
him
well
as
well
as
her
own
what
more
could
felipe
ask
with
a
groan
wrung
from
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
he
tossed
the
man
a
another
to
the
woman
i
am
sorry
he
said
alessandro
was
my
friend
i
wanted
to
see
him
and
he
rode
away
carmena
eyes
following
him
with
a
covert
gleam
of
triumph
when
these
last
words
of
his
were
interpreted
to
her
she
started
made
as
if
she
would
run
after
him
but
checked
herself
no
she
thought
it
may
be
a
lie
he
may
be
an
enemy
for
all
that
i
will
not
tell
alessandro
wished
not
to
be
found
i
will
not
and
thus
vanished
the
last
chance
of
succor
for
ramona
vanished
in
a
moment
blown
like
a
thistledown
on
a
chance
breath
the
breath
of
a
loyal
loving
friend
speaking
a
lie
to
save
her
distraught
with
grief
felipe
returned
home
ramona
had
been
very
ill
when
she
left
home
had
she
died
and
been
buried
by
the
lonely
sorrowing
alessandro
and
was
that
the
reason
alessandro
was
going
away
to
the
north
never
to
return
fool
that
he
was
to
have
shrunk
from
speaking
ramona
name
to
the
indians
he
would
return
and
ask
again
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
his
mother
he
would
set
off
again
and
never
cease
searching
till
he
had
found
either
ramona
or
her
grave
but
when
felipe
entered
his
mother
presence
his
first
look
in
her
face
told
him
that
he
would
not
leave
her
side
again
until
he
had
laid
her
at
rest
in
the
tomb
thank
god
you
have
come
felipe
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
i
had
begun
to
fear
you
would
not
come
in
time
to
say
farewell
to
me
i
am
going
to
leave
you
my
son
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
though
she
no
longer
wished
to
live
neither
did
she
wish
to
die
this
poor
proud
passionate
defeated
bereft
senora
all
the
consolations
of
her
religion
seemed
to
fail
her
she
had
prayed
incessantly
but
got
no
peace
she
fixed
her
imploring
eyes
on
the
virgin
face
and
on
the
saints
but
all
seemed
to
her
to
wear
a
forbidding
look
if
father
salvierderra
would
only
come
she
groaned
he
could
give
me
peace
if
only
i
can
live
till
he
comes
again
when
felipe
told
her
of
the
old
man
feeble
state
and
that
he
would
never
again
make
the
journey
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
wept
not
only
for
her
own
soul
help
did
she
wish
to
see
him
she
wished
to
put
into
his
hands
the
ortegna
jewels
what
would
become
of
them
to
whom
should
she
transfer
the
charge
was
there
a
secular
priest
within
reach
that
she
could
trust
when
her
sister
had
said
in
her
instructions
the
church
she
meant
as
the
senora
moreno
well
knew
the
franciscans
the
senora
dared
not
consult
felipe
yet
she
must
day
by
day
these
fretting
anxieties
and
perplexities
wasted
her
strength
and
her
fever
grew
higher
and
higher
she
asked
no
questions
as
to
the
result
of
felipe
journey
and
he
dared
not
mention
ramona
name
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
one
day
said
mother
i
found
no
trace
of
ramona
i
have
not
the
least
idea
where
she
is
the
father
had
not
seen
her
or
heard
of
her
i
fear
she
is
better
so
was
the
senora
sole
reply
and
she
fell
again
into
still
deeper
more
perplexed
thought
about
the
hidden
treasure
each
day
she
resolved
i
will
tell
felipe
and
when
came
she
put
it
off
again
finally
she
decided
not
to
do
it
till
she
found
herself
dying
father
salvierderra
might
yet
come
once
more
and
then
all
would
be
well
with
trembling
hands
she
wrote
him
a
letter
imploring
him
to
be
brought
to
her
and
sent
it
by
messenger
who
was
empowered
to
hire
a
litter
and
four
men
to
bring
the
father
gently
and
carefully
all
the
way
but
when
the
messenger
reached
santa
barbara
father
salvierderra
was
too
feeble
to
be
moved
too
feeble
even
to
write
he
could
write
only
by
amanuensis
and
wrote
therefore
guardedly
sending
her
his
blessing
and
saying
that
he
hoped
her
might
yet
be
restored
to
the
keeping
of
her
friends
the
father
had
been
in
sore
straits
of
mind
as
month
after
month
had
passed
without
tidings
of
his
blessed
soon
after
this
came
the
news
that
the
father
was
dead
this
dealt
the
senora
a
terrible
blow
she
never
left
her
bed
after
it
and
so
the
year
had
worn
on
and
felipe
mourning
over
his
sinking
and
failing
mother
and
haunted
by
terrible
fears
about
the
lost
ramona
had
been
tortured
indeed
but
the
end
drew
near
now
the
senora
was
plainly
dying
the
ventura
doctor
had
left
off
coming
saying
that
he
could
do
no
more
nothing
remained
but
to
give
her
what
ease
was
possible
in
a
day
or
two
more
all
would
be
over
felipe
hardly
left
her
bedside
rarely
was
mother
so
loved
and
nursed
by
son
no
daughter
could
have
shown
more
tenderness
and
devotion
in
the
close
relation
and
affection
of
these
last
days
the
sense
of
alienation
and
antagonism
faded
from
both
their
hearts
my
adorable
felipe
she
would
murmur
what
a
son
hast
thou
been
and
my
beloved
mother
how
shall
i
give
you
up
felipe
would
reply
bowing
his
head
on
her
hands
so
wasted
now
so
white
so
weak
those
hands
which
had
been
cruel
and
strong
little
more
than
one
short
year
ago
ah
no
one
could
refuse
to
forgive
the
senora
now
the
gentle
ramona
had
she
seen
her
had
wept
tears
of
pity
her
eyes
wore
at
times
a
look
almost
of
terror
it
was
the
secret
how
should
she
speak
it
what
would
felipe
say
at
last
the
moment
came
she
had
been
with
difficulty
roused
from
a
long
fainting
one
more
such
would
be
the
last
she
knew
knew
even
better
than
those
around
her
as
she
regained
consciousness
she
gasped
felipe
alone
he
understood
and
waved
the
rest
away
alone
she
said
again
turning
her
eyes
to
the
door
leave
the
room
said
felipe
all
wait
outside
and
he
closed
the
door
on
them
even
then
the
senora
hesitated
almost
was
she
ready
to
go
out
of
life
leaving
the
hidden
treasure
to
its
chance
of
discovery
rather
than
with
her
own
lips
reveal
to
felipe
what
she
saw
now
saw
with
the
terrible
relentless
of
death
would
make
him
even
after
she
was
in
her
grave
reproach
her
in
his
thoughts
but
she
dared
not
withhold
it
it
must
be
said
pointing
to
the
statue
of
saint
catharine
whose
face
seemed
she
thought
to
frown
unforgiving
upon
her
she
said
felipe
behind
that
statue
look
felipe
thought
her
delirious
and
said
tenderly
nothing
is
there
dearest
mother
be
calm
i
am
new
terror
seized
the
dying
woman
was
she
to
be
forced
to
carry
the
secret
to
the
grave
to
be
denied
this
late
avowal
no
no
felipe
there
is
a
door
there
secret
door
look
open
i
must
tell
you
hastily
felipe
moved
the
statue
there
was
indeed
the
door
as
she
had
said
do
not
tell
me
now
mother
dear
wait
till
you
are
stronger
he
said
as
he
spoke
he
turned
and
saw
with
alarm
his
mother
sitting
upright
in
the
bed
her
right
arm
outstretched
her
hand
pointing
to
the
door
her
eyes
in
a
glassy
stare
her
face
convulsed
before
a
cry
could
pass
his
lips
she
had
fallen
back
the
senora
moreno
was
dead
at
felipe
cry
the
women
waiting
in
the
hall
hurried
in
wailing
aloud
as
their
first
glance
showed
them
all
was
over
in
the
confusion
felipe
with
a
pale
set
face
pushed
the
statue
back
into
its
place
even
then
a
premonition
of
horror
swept
over
him
what
was
he
the
son
to
find
behind
that
secret
door
at
sight
of
which
his
mother
had
died
with
that
look
of
anguished
terror
in
her
eyes
all
through
the
sad
duties
of
the
next
four
days
felipe
was
conscious
of
the
undercurrent
of
this
premonition
the
funeral
ceremonies
were
impressive
the
little
chapel
could
not
hold
the
quarter
part
of
those
who
came
from
far
and
near
everybody
wished
to
do
honor
to
the
senora
moreno
a
priest
from
ventura
and
one
from
san
luis
obispo
were
there
when
all
was
done
they
bore
the
senora
to
the
little
graveyard
on
the
hillside
and
laid
her
by
the
side
of
her
husband
and
her
children
silent
and
still
at
last
the
restless
passionate
proud
sad
heart
when
the
night
after
the
funeral
the
servants
saw
senor
felipe
going
into
his
mother
room
they
shuddered
and
whispered
oh
he
must
not
he
will
break
his
heart
senor
felipe
how
he
loved
her
old
marda
ventured
to
follow
him
and
at
the
threshold
said
dear
senor
felipe
do
not
it
is
not
good
to
go
there
come
away
but
he
put
her
gently
by
saying
i
would
rather
be
here
good
marda
and
went
in
and
locked
the
door
it
was
past
midnight
when
he
came
out
his
face
was
stern
he
had
buried
his
mother
again
well
might
the
senora
have
dreaded
to
tell
to
felipe
the
tale
of
the
ortegna
treasure
until
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
and
found
the
senora
ortegna
letter
to
his
mother
he
was
in
entire
bewilderment
at
all
he
saw
after
he
had
read
this
letter
he
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
his
soul
was
wrung
and
she
thought
that
shame
and
not
this
he
said
bitterly
but
one
thing
remained
for
felipe
now
if
ramona
lived
he
would
find
her
and
restore
to
her
this
her
rightful
property
if
she
were
dead
it
must
go
to
the
santa
barbara
college
surely
my
mother
must
have
intended
to
give
it
to
the
church
he
said
but
why
keep
it
all
this
time
it
is
this
that
has
killed
her
oh
shame
oh
disgrace
from
the
grave
in
which
felipe
had
buried
his
mother
now
was
no
resurrection
replacing
everything
as
before
in
the
safe
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
superior
of
the
santa
barbara
college
telling
him
of
the
existence
of
these
valuables
which
in
certain
contingencies
would
belong
to
the
college
early
in
the
morning
he
gave
this
letter
to
juan
canito
saying
i
am
going
away
juan
on
a
journey
if
anything
happens
to
me
and
i
do
not
return
send
this
letter
by
trusty
messenger
to
santa
will
you
be
long
away
senor
felipe
asked
the
old
man
piteously
i
can
not
tell
juan
replied
felipe
it
may
be
only
a
short
time
it
may
be
long
i
leave
everything
in
your
care
you
will
do
all
according
to
your
best
judgment
i
know
i
will
say
to
all
that
i
have
left
you
in
thanks
senor
felipe
thanks
exclaimed
juan
happier
than
he
had
been
for
two
years
indeed
you
may
trust
me
from
the
time
you
were
a
boy
till
now
i
have
had
no
thought
except
for
your
even
in
heaven
the
senora
moreno
had
felt
woe
as
if
in
hell
had
she
known
the
thoughts
with
which
her
felipe
galloped
this
morning
out
of
the
gateway
through
which
only
the
day
before
he
had
walked
weeping
behind
her
body
borne
to
burial
and
she
thought
this
no
shame
to
the
house
of
moreno
he
said
my
god
xxii
during
the
first
day
of
ramona
and
alessandro
sad
journey
they
scarcely
spoke
alessandro
walked
at
the
horses
heads
his
face
sunk
on
his
breast
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
ramona
watched
him
in
anxious
fear
even
the
baby
voice
and
cooing
laugh
won
from
him
no
response
after
they
were
camped
for
the
night
she
said
dear
alessandro
will
you
not
tell
me
where
we
are
going
in
spite
of
her
gentleness
there
was
a
shade
of
wounded
feeling
in
her
tone
alessandro
flung
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
and
cried
my
majella
my
majella
it
seems
to
me
i
am
going
mad
i
can
not
tell
what
to
do
i
do
not
know
what
i
think
all
my
thoughts
seem
whirling
round
as
leaves
do
in
brooks
in
the
time
of
the
spring
rains
do
you
think
i
can
be
going
mad
it
was
enough
to
make
me
ramona
her
own
heart
wrung
with
fear
soothed
him
as
best
she
could
dear
alessandro
she
said
let
us
go
to
los
angeles
and
not
live
with
the
indians
any
more
you
could
get
work
there
you
could
play
at
dances
sometimes
there
must
be
plenty
of
work
i
could
get
more
sewing
to
do
too
it
would
be
better
i
he
looked
at
the
thought
go
live
among
the
white
people
he
cried
what
does
majella
think
would
become
of
one
indian
or
two
alone
among
whites
if
they
will
come
to
our
villages
and
drive
us
out
a
hundred
at
a
time
what
would
they
do
to
one
man
alone
oh
majella
is
foolish
but
there
are
many
of
your
people
at
work
for
whites
at
san
bernardino
and
other
places
she
persisted
why
could
not
we
do
as
they
do
yes
he
said
bitterly
at
work
for
whites
so
they
are
majella
has
not
seen
no
man
will
pay
an
indian
but
half
wages
even
long
ago
when
the
fathers
were
not
all
gone
and
tried
to
help
the
indians
my
father
has
told
me
that
it
was
the
way
only
to
pay
an
indian
that
a
white
man
or
a
mexican
had
it
was
the
mexicans
too
did
that
majella
and
now
they
pay
the
indians
in
money
sometimes
half
wages
sometimes
in
bad
flour
or
things
he
does
not
want
sometimes
in
whiskey
and
if
he
will
not
take
it
and
asks
for
his
money
they
laugh
and
tell
him
to
go
then
one
man
in
san
bernardino
last
year
when
an
indian
would
not
take
a
bottle
of
sour
wine
for
pay
for
a
day
work
shot
him
in
the
cheek
with
his
pistol
and
told
him
to
mind
how
he
was
insolent
any
more
oh
majella
do
not
ask
me
to
go
work
in
the
towns
i
should
kill
some
man
majella
if
i
saw
things
like
ramona
shuddered
and
was
silent
alessandro
continued
if
majella
would
not
be
afraid
i
know
a
place
high
up
on
the
mountain
where
no
white
man
has
ever
been
or
ever
will
be
i
found
it
when
i
was
following
a
bear
the
beast
led
me
up
it
was
his
home
and
i
said
then
it
was
a
fit
for
a
man
there
is
water
and
a
little
green
valley
we
could
live
there
but
it
would
be
no
more
than
to
live
it
is
very
small
the
valley
majella
would
be
afraid
yes
alessandro
i
would
be
afraid
all
alone
on
a
high
mountain
oh
do
not
let
us
go
there
try
something
else
first
alessandro
is
there
no
other
indian
village
you
know
there
is
saboba
he
said
at
foot
of
the
san
jacinto
mountain
i
had
thought
of
that
some
of
my
people
went
there
from
temecula
but
it
is
a
poor
little
village
majella
majella
would
not
like
to
live
in
it
neither
do
i
believe
it
will
long
be
any
safer
than
san
pasquale
there
was
a
kind
good
old
man
who
owned
all
that
valley
senor
ravallo
he
found
the
village
of
saboba
there
when
he
came
to
the
country
it
is
one
of
the
very
oldest
of
all
he
was
good
to
all
indians
and
he
said
they
should
never
be
disturbed
never
he
is
dead
but
his
three
sons
have
the
estate
yet
and
i
think
they
would
keep
their
father
promise
to
the
indians
but
you
see
majella
they
may
die
or
go
back
to
mexico
as
senor
valdez
did
and
then
the
americans
will
get
it
as
they
did
temecula
and
there
are
already
white
men
living
in
the
valley
we
will
go
that
way
majella
majella
shall
see
if
she
says
stay
we
will
it
was
in
the
early
afternoon
that
they
entered
the
broad
valley
of
san
jacinto
they
entered
it
from
the
west
as
they
came
in
though
the
sky
over
their
heads
was
overcast
and
gray
the
eastern
and
northeastern
part
of
the
valley
was
flooded
with
a
strange
light
at
once
ruddy
and
golden
it
was
a
glorious
sight
the
jagged
top
and
spurs
of
san
jacinto
mountain
shone
like
the
turrets
and
posterns
of
a
citadel
built
of
rubies
the
glow
seemed
preternatural
behold
san
jacinto
cried
alessandro
ramona
exclaimed
in
delight
it
is
an
omen
she
said
we
are
going
into
the
sunlight
out
of
the
shadow
and
she
glanced
back
at
the
west
which
was
of
a
slaty
blackness
i
like
it
not
said
alessandro
the
shadow
follows
too
fast
indeed
it
did
even
as
he
spoke
a
fierce
wind
blew
from
the
north
and
tearing
off
fleeces
from
the
black
cloud
sent
them
in
scurrying
masses
across
the
sky
in
a
moment
more
began
to
fall
holy
virgin
cried
alessandro
too
well
he
knew
what
it
meant
he
urged
the
horses
running
fast
beside
them
it
was
of
no
use
too
much
even
for
baba
and
benito
to
make
any
haste
with
the
heavily
loaded
wagon
there
is
an
old
and
a
hut
not
over
a
mile
farther
if
we
could
but
reach
it
groaned
alessandro
majella
you
and
the
child
will
she
is
warm
on
my
breast
said
ramona
but
alessandro
what
ice
in
this
wind
it
is
like
a
knife
at
my
back
alessandro
uttered
another
ejaculation
of
dismay
the
snow
was
fast
thickening
already
the
track
was
covered
the
wind
lessened
thank
god
that
wind
no
longer
cuts
as
it
did
said
ramona
her
teeth
chattering
clasping
the
baby
closer
and
closer
i
would
rather
it
blew
than
not
said
alessandro
it
will
carry
the
snow
before
it
a
little
more
of
this
and
we
can
not
see
any
more
than
in
the
still
thicker
and
faster
fell
the
snow
the
air
was
dense
it
was
as
alessandro
had
said
worse
than
the
darkness
of
night
this
strange
opaque
whiteness
thick
choking
freezing
one
breath
presently
the
rough
jolting
of
the
wagon
showed
that
they
were
off
the
road
the
horses
stopped
refused
to
go
on
we
are
lost
if
we
stay
here
cried
alessandro
come
my
benito
come
and
he
took
him
by
the
head
and
pulled
him
by
main
force
back
into
the
road
and
led
him
along
it
was
terrible
ramona
heart
sank
within
her
she
felt
her
arms
growing
numb
how
much
longer
could
she
hold
the
baby
safe
she
called
to
alessandro
he
did
not
hear
her
the
wind
had
risen
again
the
snow
was
being
blown
in
masses
it
was
like
making
headway
among
whirling
we
will
die
thought
ramona
perhaps
it
is
as
well
and
that
was
the
last
she
knew
till
she
heard
a
shouting
and
found
herself
being
shaken
and
beaten
and
heard
a
strange
voice
saying
sorry
ter
handle
yer
so
rough
but
we
got
ter
git
yer
out
ter
the
fire
fire
were
there
such
things
as
fire
and
warmth
mechanically
she
put
the
baby
into
the
unknown
arms
that
were
reaching
up
to
her
and
tried
to
rise
from
her
seat
but
she
could
not
move
set
still
set
still
said
the
strange
voice
i
jest
carry
the
baby
ter
my
wife
an
come
back
fur
you
i
allowed
yer
could
git
up
on
yer
feet
and
the
tall
form
disappeared
the
baby
thus
vigorously
disturbed
from
her
warm
sleep
began
to
cry
thank
god
said
alessandro
at
the
plunging
horses
heads
the
child
is
alive
majella
he
called
yes
alessandro
she
answered
faintly
the
gusts
sweeping
her
voice
like
a
distant
echo
past
him
it
was
a
marvellous
rescue
they
had
been
nearer
the
old
than
alessandro
had
thought
but
except
that
other
travellers
had
reached
it
before
them
alessandro
had
never
found
it
just
as
he
felt
his
strength
failing
him
and
had
thought
to
himself
in
almost
the
same
despairing
words
as
ramona
this
will
end
all
our
troubles
he
saw
a
faint
light
to
the
left
instantly
he
had
turned
the
horses
heads
towards
it
the
ground
was
rough
and
broken
and
more
than
once
he
had
been
in
danger
of
overturning
the
wagon
but
he
had
pressed
on
shouting
at
intervals
for
help
at
last
his
call
was
answered
and
another
light
appeared
this
time
a
swinging
one
coming
slowly
towards
him
a
lantern
in
the
hand
of

this
replied
the
woman
as
she
took
the
baby
which
recognized
the
motherly
hand
at
its
first
touch
and
ceased
crying
why
yer
pooty
little
thing
she
exclaimed
as
she
looked
into
the
baby
face
i
declar
jos

o
sech
a
mite

this

warm

this
better
th
mother
fust
ri
said
jeff
leading
half
carrying
ramona
into
the
hut
she
nigh
abaout
froze
stiff
but
the
sight
of
her
baby
safe
and
smiling
was
a
better
restorative
for
ramona
than
anything
else
and
in
a
few
moments
she
had
fully
recovered
it
was
in
a
strange
group
she
found
herself
on
a
mattress
in
the
corner
of
the
hut
lay
a
young
man
apparently
about
whose
bright
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
told
but
too
plainly
the
story
of
his
disease
the
woman
tall
ungainly
her
face
gaunt
her
hands
hardened
and
wrinkled
gown
ragged
shoes
ragged
her
dry
and
broken
light
hair
wound
in
a
careless
straggling
knot
in
her
neck
wisps
of
it
flying
over
her
forehead
was
certainly
not
a
prepossessing
figure
yet
spite
of
her
careless
unkempt
condition
there
was
a
certain
gentle
dignity
in
her
bearing
and
a
kindliness
in
her
glance
which
won
trust
and
warmed
hearts
at
once
her
pale
blue
eyes
were
still
and
as
she
fixed
them
on
ramona
she
thought
to
herself
this
ai
no
common
mexican
no
be
ye
movers
she
said
ramona
stared
in
the
little
english
she
knew
that
word
was
not
included
ah
senora
she
said
regretfully
i
can
not
talk
in
the
english
speech

in
spanish

and
she
chuckled
grimly
but
with
a
side
glance
of
ineffable
tenderness
at
the
sick
man
ask
her
who
they
be
jos
she
added
jos
lifted
himself
on
his
elbow
and
fixing
his
shining
eyes
on
ramona
said
in
spanish
my
mother

ramona
listened
and
looked
intently
but
could
understand
nothing
almost
she
doubted
if
the
woman
were
really
speaking
english
she
had
never
before
heard
so
many
english
sentences
without
being
able
to
understand
one
word
the
tennessee
drawl
so
altered
even
the
commonest
words
that
she
did
not
recognize
them
turning
to
jos
she
said
gently

he
said
to
ramona
swifter
than
lightning
ramona
had
seized
the
woman
hand
and
carried
it
to
her
heart
with
an
expressive
gesture
of
gratitude
and
emotion
thanks
thanks
senora
she
cried
what

explained
his

disclaimer
of

and
the
choice
of

she
offered
to
ramona
ramona
with
smiles
which

was
crouching
in
the
corner
by
the
fire
her
baby
held
close
to
her
breast
the
place
which
at
first
had
seemed
a
haven
of
warmth
she
now
saw
was
indeed
but
a
poor
shelter
against
the
fearful
storm
which
raged
outside
it
was
only
a
hut
of
rough
boards
carelessly
knocked
together
for
a
shepherd
temporary
home
it
had
been
long
unused
and
many
of
the
boards
were
loose
and
broken
through
these
crevices
at
every
blast
of
the
wind
the
fine
snow
swirled
on
the
hearth
were
burning
a
few
sticks
of
wood
dead
cottonwood
branches
which
jef
hyer
had
hastily
collected
before
the
storm
reached
its
height
a
few
more
sticks
lay
by
the
hearth
aunt
ri
glanced
at
them
anxiously
a
poor
provision
for
a
night
in
the
snow
be
ye
warm
jos
she
asked
not
very
mammy
he
said
but
i
ai
cold
nuther
an
it
was
the
way
in
the
hyer
family
to
make
the
best
of
things
they
had
always
possessed
this
virtue
to
such
an
extent
that
they
suffered
from
it
as
from
a
vice
there
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
all
southern
tennessee
a
more
contented
shiftless
family
than
theirs
but
there
was
no
grumbling
whatever
went
wrong
whatever
was
lacking
it
was
jest
like
aour
luck
they
said
and
did
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
about
it
affectionate
humorous
people
after
all
they
got
more
comfort
out
of
life
than
many
a
family
whose
surface
conditions
were
incomparably
better
than
theirs
when
jos
their
oldest
child
and
only
son
broke
down
had
hemorrhage
after
hemorrhage
and
the
doctor
said
the
only
thing
that
could
save
him
was
to
go
across
the
plains
in
a
wagon
to
california
they
said
what
good
luck
was
married
last
year
now
there
ai
nuthin
ter
hinder
sellin
the
farm
goin
right
and
they
sold
their
little
place
for
half
it
was
worth
traded
cattle
for
a
pair
of
horses
and
a
covered
wagon
and
set
off
half
beggared
with
their
sick
boy
on
a
bed
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
as
cheery
as
if
they
were
rich
people
on
a
a
pair
of
steers
to
spell
the
horses
and
a
cow
to
give
milk
for
jos
they
drove
before
them
and
so
they
had
come
by
slow
stages
sometimes
camping
for
a
week
at
a
time
all
the
way
from
tennessee
to
the
san
jacinto
valley
they
were
rewarded
jos
was
getting
well
another
six
months
they
thought
would
see
him
cured
and
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
any
one
who
had
tried
to
persuade
either
jefferson
or
maria
hyer
that
they
were
not
as
lucky
a
couple
as
could
be
found
had
they
not
saved
joshua
their
son
nicknames
among
this
class
of
poor
whites
in
the
south
seem
singularly
like
those
in
vogue
in
new
england
from
totally
opposite
motives
the
lazy
tennesseean
and
the
vermonter
cut
down
all
their
family
names
to
the
shortest
to
speak
three
syllables
where
one
will
answer
seems
to
the
vermonter
a
waste
of
time
to
the
tennesseean
quite
too
much
trouble
hyer
could
hardly
recollect
ever
having
heard
her
name
maria
in
full
as
a
child
and
until
she
was
married
she
was
simply
ri
and
as
soon
as
she
had
a
house
of
her
own
to
become
a
centre
of
hospitality
and
help
she
was
adopted
by
common
consent
of
the
neighborhood
in
a
sort
of
titular
and
universal
which
really
was
a
much
greater
tribute
and
honor
than
she
dreamed
not
a
man
woman
or
child
within
her
reach
that
did
not
call
her
or
know
of
her
as
aunt
i
donno
whether
i
best
make
enny
more
fire
naow
or
not
she
said
reflectively
ef
this
storm
goin
to
last
till
mornin
we
come
short
o
wood
thet
as
she
spoke
the
door
of
the
hut
burst
open
and
her
husband
staggered
in
followed
by
alessandro
both
covered
with
snow
their
arms
full
of
wood
alessandro
luckily
knew
of
a
little
clump
of
young
in
a
ravine
only
a
few
rods
from
the
house
and
the
first
thing
he
had
thought
of
after
tethering
the
horses
in
shelter
between
the
hut
and
the
wagons
was
to
get
wood
jeff
seeing
him
take
a
hatchet
from
the
wagon
had
understood
got
his
own
and
followed
and
now
there
lay
on
the
ground
enough
to
keep
them
warm
for
hours
as
soon
as
alessandro
had
thrown
down
his
load
he
darted
to
ramona
and
kneeling
down
looked
anxiously
into
the
baby
face
then
into
hers
then
he
said
devoutly
the
saints
be
praised
my
majella
it
is
a
miracle
jos
listened
in
dismay
to
this
ejaculation
ef
they
ai
catholics
he
thought
what
kind
o
injuns
be
they
i
wonder
i
wo
tell
mammy
they
catholics

ever
i
do
care
what
they
be
thet
gal
got
the
sweetest
her
head
ever
i
saw
sence
i
wuz
by
help
of
jos
interpreting
the
two
families
soon
became
well
acquainted
with
each
other
condition
and
plans
and
a
feeling
of
friendliness
surprising
under
the
circumstances
grew
up
between
them
jeff
said
aunt
ri
jeff
they
ca
understand
a
word
we
say
no
harm
done
i
to
speak

seem
hardly

naow
jeff
d
yer
think
yer
ever
did
yerself
aunt
ri
was
excited
the
experience
was
to
her
almost
incredible
her
ideas
of
indians
had
been
drawn
from
newspapers
and
from
a
book
or
two
of
narratives
of
massacres
and
from
an
occasional
sight
of
vagabond
bands
or
families
they
had
encountered
in
their
journey
across
the
plains
here
she
found
herself
sitting
side
by
side
in
friendly
intercourse
with
an
indian
man
and
indian
woman
whose
appearance
and
behavior
were
attractive
towards
whom
she
felt
herself
singularly
drawn
i
free
to
confess
jos
she
said
i
would
ha
bleeved
it
i
hai
seen
nobody
black
white
or
gray
sence
we
left
hum
i
took
to
like
these
yere
folks
an
they
real
dark
dark
any
nigger
in
tennessee
he
pewer
injun
her
father
wuz
white
she
sez
but
she
do
call
herself
nothin
but
an
injun
the
same
he
is
d
yer
notice
the
way
she
looks
at
him
jos
do
she
jest
set
a
store
by
thet
feller
i
do
blame
indeed
jos
had
noticed
no
man
was
likely
to
see
ramona
with
alessandro
without
perceiving
the
rare
quality
of
her
devotion
to
him
and
now
there
was
added
to
this
devotion
an
element
of
indefinable
anxiety
which
made
its
vigilance
unceasing
ramona
feared
for
alessandro
reason
she
had
hardly
put
it
into
words
to
herself
but
the
terrible
fear
dwelt
with
her
she
felt
that
another
blow
would
be
more
than
he
could
bear
the
storm
lasted
only
a
few
hours
when
it
cleared
the
valley
was
a
solid
expanse
of
white
and
the
stars
shone
out
as
if
in
an
arctic
sky
it
will
be
all
gone
by
noon
said
alessandro
to
jos
who
was
dreading
the
next
day
not
really
he
said
you
will
see
said
alessandro
i
have
often
known
it
thus
it
is
like
death
while
it
lasts
but
it
is
never
the
hyers
were
on
their
way
to
some
hot
springs
on
the
north
side
of
the
valley
here
they
proposed
to
camp
for
three
months
to
try
the
waters
for
jos
they
had
a
tent
and
all
that
was
necessary
for
living
in
their
primitive
fashion
aunt
ri
was
looking
forward
to
the
rest
with
great
anticipation
she
was
heartily
tired
of
being
on
the
move
her
anticipations
were
of
a
more
stirring
nature
he
had
heard
that
there
was
good
hunting
on
san
jacinto
mountain
when
he
found
that
alessandro
knew
the
region
thoroughly
and
had
been
thinking
of
settling
there
he
was
rejoiced
and
proposed
to
him
to
become
his
companion
and
guide
in
hunting
expeditions
ramona
grasped
eagerly
at
the
suggestion
companionship
she
was
sure
would
do
alessandro
good
companionship
the
outdoor
life
and
the
excitement
of
hunting
of
which
he
was
fond
this
canon
was
only
a
short
distance
from
the
saboba
village
of
which
they
had
spoken
as
a
possible
home
which
she
had
from
the
first
desired
to
try
she
no
longer
had
repugnance
to
the
thought
of
an
indian
village
she
already
felt
a
sense
of
kinship
and
shelter
with
any
indian
people
she
had
become
as
carmena
had
said
one
of
a
few
days
saw
the
two
families
settled
the
hyers
in
their
tent
and
wagon
at
the
hot
springs
and
alessandro
and
ramona
with
the
baby
in
a
little
adobe
house
in
the
saboba
village
the
house
belonged
to
an
old
indian
woman
who
her
husband
having
died
had
gone
to
live
with
a
daughter
and
was
very
glad
to
get
a
few
dollars
by
renting
her
own
house
it
was
a
wretched
place
one
small
room
walled
with
poorly
made
adobe
bricks
thatched
with
tule
no
floor
and
only
one
window
when
alessandro
heard
ramona
say
cheerily
oh
this
will
do
very
well
when
it
is
repaired
a
little
his
face
was
convulsed
and
he
turned
away
but
he
said
nothing
it
was
the
only
house
to
be
had
in
the
village
and
there
were
few
better
two
months
later
no
one
would
have
known
it
alessandro
had
had
good
luck
in
hunting
two
fine
deerskins
covered
the
earth
floor
a
third
was
spread
over
the
bedstead
and
the
horns
hung
on
the
walls
served
for
hooks
to
hang
clothes
upon
the
scarlet
calico
canopy
was
again
set
up
over
the
bed
and
the
woven
cradle
on
its
red
manzanita
frame
stood
near
a
small
window
in
the
door
and
one
more
cut
in
the
walls
let
in
light
and
air
on
a
shelf
near
one
of
these
windows
stood
the
little
madonna
again
wreathed
with
vines
as
in
san
pasquale
when
aunt
ri
first
saw
the
room
after
it
was
thus
arranged
she
put
both
arms
akimbo
and
stood
in
the
doorway
her
mouth
wide
open
her
eyes
full
of
wonder
finally
her
wonder
framed
itself
in
an
ejaculation
wall
i
allow
yer
air
fixed
up
aunt
ri
at
her
best
estate
had
never
possessed
a
room
which
had
the
expression
of
this
poor
little
mud
hut
of
ramona
she
could
not
understand
it
the
more
she
studied
the
place
the
less
she
understood
it
on
returning
to
the
tent
she
said
to
jos
it
beats
all
ever
i
see
the
way
thet
injun
woman
got
fixed
up
out
er
nothin
it
ai
no
a
hovel
a
mud
hovel
jos
not
much
this
yer
tent
fur
all
three
on
an
the
bed
an
the
stove
an
everythin
an
i
vow
jos
she
fixed
it
looks
jest
like
a
parlor
it
beats
me
it
does
i
jest
like
you
to
see
and
when
jos
saw
it
and
jeff
they
were
as
full
of
wonder
as
aunt
ri
had
been
dimly
they
recognized
the
existence
of
a
principle
here
which
had
never
entered
into
their
life
they
did
not
know
it
by
name
and
it
could
not
have
been
either
taught
transferred
or
explained
to
the
wife
and
mother
who
had
been
so
many
years
the
affectionate
disorderly
genius
of
their
home
but
they
felt
its
charm
and
when
one
day
after
the
return
of
alessandro
and
jeff
from
a
particularly
successful
hunt
the
two
families
had
sat
down
together
to
a
supper
of
ramona
cooking
stewed
venison
and
artichokes
and
frijoles
with
chili
their
wonder
was
still
greater
ask
her
if
this
is
injun
style
of
cooking
jos
said
aunt
ri
i
never
thought
nothin
o
beans
but
these
air
good
no
mistake
ramona
laughed
no
it
is
mexican
she
said
i
learned
to
cook
from
an
old
mexican
wall
i
like
the
receipt
o
but
i
allow
i
should
never
git
the
time
to
fuss
with
it
said
aunt
ri
but
i
may
well
git
the
rule
naow
i
alessandro
began
to
lose
some
of
his
gloom
he
had
earned
money
he
had
been
lifted
out
of
himself
by
kindly
companionship
he
saw
ramona
cheerful
the
little
one
sunny
the
sense
of
home
the
strongest
passion
alessandro
possessed
next
to
his
love
for
ramona
began
again
to
awake
in
him
he
began
to
talk
about
building
a
house
he
had
found
things
in
the
village
better
than
he
feared
it
was
but
a
little
handful
to
be
sure
still
they
were
unmolested
the
valley
was
large
their
stock
ran
free
the
few
white
settlers
one
at
the
upper
end
and
two
or
three
on
the
south
side
had
manifested
no
disposition
to
crowd
the
indians
the
ravallo
brothers
were
living
on
the
estate
still
and
there
was
protection
in
that
alessandro
thought
and
majella
was
content
majella
had
found
friends
something
not
quite
hope
but
akin
to
it
began
to
stir
in
alessandro
heart
he
would
build
a
house
majella
should
no
longer
live
in
this
mud
hut
but
to
his
surprise
when
he
spoke
of
it
ramona
said
no
they
had
all
they
needed
now
was
not
alessandro
comfortable
she
was
it
would
be
wise
to
wait
longer
before
building
ramona
knew
many
things
that
alessandro
did
not
while
he
had
been
away
on
his
hunts
she
had
had
speech
with
many
a
one
he
never
saw
she
had
gone
to
the
store
and
several
times
to
exchange
baskets
or
lace
for
flour
and
she
had
heard
talk
there
which
disquieted
her
she
did
not
believe
that
saboba
was
safe
one
day
she
had
heard
a
man
say
if
there
is
a
drought
we
shall
have
the
devil
to
pay
with
our
stock
before
winter
is
yes
said
another
and
look
at
those
damned
indians
over
there
in
saboba
with
water
running
all
the
time
in
their
village
it
a
shame
they
should
have
that
spring
not
for
worlds
would
ramona
have
told
this
to
alessandro
she
kept
it
locked
in
her
own
breast
but
it
rankled
there
like
a
ceaseless
warning
and
prophecy
when
she
reached
home
that
day
she
went
down
to
the
spring
in
the
centre
of
the
village
and
stood
a
long
time
looking
at
the
bubbling
water
it
was
indeed
a
priceless
treasure
a
long
irrigating
ditch
led
from
it
down
into
the
bottom
where
lay
the
cultivated
fields
many
acres
in
wheat
barley
and
vegetables
alessandro
himself
had
fields
there
from
which
they
would
harvest
all
they
needed
for
the
horses
and
their
cow
all
winter
in
case
pasturage
failed
if
the
whites
took
away
this
water
saboba
would
be
ruined
however
as
the
spring
began
in
the
very
heart
of
the
village
they
could
not
take
it
without
destroying
the
village
and
the
ravallos
would
surely
never
let
that
be
done
thought
ramona
while
they
live
it
will
not
it
was
a
sad
day
for
ramona
and
alessandro
when
the
kindly
hyers
pulled
up
their
and
left
the
valley
their
intended
three
months
had
stretched
into
six
they
had
so
enjoyed
the
climate
and
the
waters
had
seemed
to
do
such
good
to
jos
but
we
ai
rich
folks
yer
know
not
by
a
long
ways
we
ai
said

it
was
wonderful
what
progress
in
understanding
and
speaking
english
ramona
had
made
in
these
six
months
she
now
understood
nearly
all
that
was
said
directly
to
her
though
she
could
not
follow
general
and
confused
conversation

done
to

robbed
and
cheated

turned
out

then
she
told
the
story
of
temecula
and
of
san
pasquale
in
spanish
to
jos
who
translated
it
with
no
loss
in
the
telling
aunt
ri

aghast
she
found
no
words
to
express
her
indignation
i
do
bleeve

why

things
nobody

help
himself
for
if

against
the
law
he
has
to
be
killed
or
put
in
prison
that
was
what
the
sheriff
told
alessandro
at
temecula
he
felt
very
sorry
for
the
temecula
people
the
sheriff
did
but
he
had
to
obey
the
law
himself
alessandro

for

hot
with
shame
and
anger
and
full
of
impulse
to

yeou
yer
father
no
rest
nuther
till
yeou
find
aout
what
all
this
yere
means
she
been
tellin
but
sharper
and
closer
anxieties
than
any
connected
with
rights
to
lands
and
homes
were
pressing
upon
alessandro
and
ramona
all
summer
the
baby
had
been
slowly
drooping
so
slowly
that
it
was
each
day
possible
for
ramona
to
deceive
herself
thinking
that
there
had
been
since
yesterday
no
loss
perhaps
a
little
gain
but
looking
back
from
the
autumn
to
the
spring
and
now
from
the
winter
to
the
autumn
there
was
no
doubt
that
she
had
been
steadily
going
down
from
the
day
of
that
terrible
chill
in
the
she
had
never
been
quite
well
ramona
thought
before
that
she
was
strong
always
strong
always
beautiful
and
merry
now
her
pinched
little
face
was
sad
to
see
and
sometimes
for
hours
she
made
a
feeble
wailing
cry
without
any
apparent
cause
all
the
simple
remedies
that
aunt
ri
had
known
had
failed
to
touch
her
disease
in
fact
aunt
ri
from
the
first
had
been
baffled
in
her
own
mind
by
the
symptoms
day
after
day
alessandro
knelt
by
the
cradle
his
hands
clasped
his
face
set
hour
after
hour
night
and
day
indoors
and
out
he
bore
her
in
his
arms
trying
to
give
her
relief
prayer
after
prayer
to
the
virgin
to
the
saints
ramona
had
said
and
candles
by
the
dozen
though
money
was
now
scant
she
had
burned
before
the
madonna
all
in
vain
at
last
she
implored
alessandro
to
go
to
san
bernardino
and
see
a
doctor
find
aunt
ri
she
said
she
will
go
with
you
with
jos
and
talk
to
him
she
can
make
him
understand
tell
aunt
ri
she
seems
just
as
she
did
when
they
were
here
only
weaker
and
alessandro
found
aunt
ri
in
a
sort
of
shanty
on
the
outskirts
of
san
bernardino
not
to
rights
yit
she
said
as
if
she
ever
would
be
jeff
had
found
work
and
jos
too
had
been
able
to
do
a
little
on
pleasant
days
he
had
made
a
loom
and
put
up
a
for
his
mother
a
floor
just
large
enough
to
hold
the
loom
rough
walls
and
a
roof
one
small
square
window
that
was
all
but
if
aunt
ri
had
been
presented
with
a
palace
she
would
not
have
been
so
well
pleased
already
she
had
woven
a
rag
carpet
for
herself
was
at
work
on
one
for
a
neighbor
and
had
promised
as
many
more
as
she
could
do
before
spring
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
a
weaver
having
gone
with
despatch
all
through
the
lower
walks
of
san
bernardino
life
i
would
hev
bleeved
they
hed
so
many
rags
besides
what
they
wearin
said
aunt
ri
as
sack
after
sack
appeared
at
her
door
already
too
aunt
ri
had
gathered
up
the
threads
of
the
village
life
in
her
friendly
impressionable
way
she
had
come
into
relation
with
scores
of
people
and
knew
who
was
who
and
what
was
what
and
why
among
them
all
far
better
than
many
an
old
resident
of
the
town
when
she
saw
benito
galloping
up
to
her
door
she
sprang
down
from
her
high
stool
at
the
loom
and
ran
bareheaded
to
the
gate
and
before
alessandro
had
dismounted
cried

bewildered
he

along

the

laughed

not
alessandro
all
the
time
studying
his
face
with
the
scrutiny
of
one
awaiting
life
and
death
i
am
the
agency
physician

suppose

the
indians

or
later

agent

man
over

to
explain
the
baby
case
cutting
her
short
the
doctor
said
yes
yes

understand
i
give
him
something
that
will
help
her
and
going
into
an
inner
room
he
brought
out
a
bottle
of
liquid
wrote
a
few
lines
of
prescription
and
handed
it
to
alessandro
saying
that
will
do
her
good
i

said
alessandro
the
doctor
stared
that

alessandro
looked
at
the
bottle
of
medicine
like
one
in
a
dream
would
it
make
the
baby
well
had
it
indeed
been
given
to
him
by
that
great
government
in
washington
was
he
to
be
protected
now
could
this
man
who
had
been
sent
out
to
take
care
of
indians
get
back
his
san
pasquale
farm
for
him
alessandro
brain
was
in
a
whirl
from
the
doctor
office
they
went
to
the
agent
house
here
aunt
ri
felt
herself
more
at
home

of
her
hand
toward
alessandro

metcen
fur
his
baby
she
reel
sick
i
the
agent
sat
down
at
his
desk
opened
a
large
ledger
saying
as
he
did
so
the
man
never
been
here
before
has
he
no
said
aunt
ri
what
is
his
name
jos
gave
it
and
the
agent
began
to
write
it
in
the
book
stop
cried
alessandro
agitatedly
to
jos
do
let
him
write
till
i
know
what
he

in
his
book
for
wait
said
jos
he
does

name
in
that
book
he
wants
to
know
what
it
put
there
wheeling
his
chair
with
a
look
of
suppressed
impatience
yet
trying
to
speak
kindly
the
agent
said
there
no
making
these
indians
understand
anything
they
seem
to
think
if
i
have
their
names
in
my
book
it
gives
me
some
power
over
wall
do
it
said
the
aunt
ri

any

over
if
yer
hai
got
it
over
them
who
have
yer
got
it
over
what
yer
goin
to
do
for
the
agent
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
well
aunt
ri
she
was
already
aunt
ri
to
the
agent
boys
that
just
the
trouble
with
this
agency
it
is
very
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
i
had
all
my
indians
on
a
alessandro
understood
the
words
my
he
had
heard
them
before
what
does
he
mean
by
his
indians
jos
he
asked
fiercely
i
will
not
have
my
name
in
his
book
if
it
makes
me
when
jos
reluctantly
interpreted
this
the
agent
lost
his
temper
that
all
the
use
there
is
trying
to
do
anything
with
them
let
him
go
then
if
he
does
want
any
help
from
the
government
oh
no
cried
aunt
ri
yeow
jest
explain
it
to
jos
an
make
him
alessandro
face
had
darkened
all
this
seemed
to
him
exceedingly
suspicious
could
it
be
possible
that
aunt
ri
and
jos
the
first
whites
except
hartsel
he
had
ever
trusted
were
deceiving
him
no
that
was
impossible
but
they
themselves
might
be
deceived
that
they
were
simple
and
ignorant
alessandro
well
knew
let
us
go
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
sign
any
naow
do
be
a
fool
will
yeow
yeow
ai
signin
a
thing
said
aunt
ri
jos
yeow
tell
him
i
say
there
ai
anythin
a
bindin
him
his
name
thet
book
it
only
so
the
agent
kin
know
what
injuns
wants
help
where
they
air
ai
thet
so
she
added
turning
to
the
agent
tell
him
he
ca
hev
the
agency
doctor
ef
he
ai
on
the
agency
not
have
the
doctor
give
up
this
precious
medicine
which
might
save
his
baby
life
no
he
could
not
do
that
majella
would
say
let
the
name
be
written
rather
than
that
let
him
write
the
name
then
said
alessandro
doggedly
but
he
went
out
of
the
room
feeling
as
if
he
had
put
a
chain
around
his
neck
xxiii
the
medicine
did
the
baby
no
good
in
fact
it
did
her
harm
she
was
too
feeble
for
violent
remedies
in
a
week
alessandro
appeared
again
at
the
agency
doctor
door
this
time
he
had
come
with
a
request
which
to
his
mind
seemed
not
unreasonable
he
had
brought
baba
for
the
doctor
to
ride
could
the
doctor
then
refuse
to
go
to
saboba
baba
would
carry
him
there
in
three
hours
and
it
would
be
like
a
cradle
all
the
way
alessandro
name
was
in
the
agency
books
it
was
for
this
he
had
written
it
for
this
and
nothing
else
to
save
the
baby
life
having
thus
enrolled
himself
as
one
of
the
agency
indians
he
had
a
claim
on
this
the
agency
doctor
and
that
his
application
might
be
all
in
due
form
he
took
with
him
the
agency
interpreter
he
had
had
a
misgiving
before
that
aunt
ri
kindly
volubility
had
not
been
well
timed
not
one
unnecessary
word
was
alessandro
motto
to
say
that
the
agency
doctor
was
astonished
at
being
requested
to
ride
thirty
miles
to
prescribe
for
an
ailing
indian
baby
would
be
a
mild
statement
of
the
doctor
emotion
he
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
when
it
was
made
clear
to
him
that
this
was
what
the
indian
father
expected
good
lord
he
said
turning
to
a
crony
who
chanced
to
be
lounging
in
the
office
listen
to
that
beggar
will
you
i
wonder
what
he
thinks
the
government
pays
me
a
year
for
doctoring
indians
alessandro
listened
so
closely
it
attracted
the
doctor
attention
do
you
understand
english
he
asked
sharply
a
very
little
senor
replied
alessandro
the
doctor
would
be
more
careful
in
his
speech
then
but
he
made
it
most
emphatically
clear
that
the
thing
alessandro
had
asked
was
not
only
out
of
the
question
but
preposterous
alessandro
pleaded
for
the
child
sake
he
could
do
it
the
horse
was
at
the
door
there
was
no
such
horse
in
san
bernardino
county
he
went
like
the
wind
and
one
would
not
know
he
was
in
motion
it
was
so
easy
would
not
the
doctor
come
down
and
look
at
the
horse
then
he
would
see
what
it
would
be
like
to
ride
him
oh
i
seen
plenty
of
your
indian
ponies
said
the
doctor
i
know
they
can
alessandro
lingered
he
could
not
give
up
this
last
hope
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
it
is
our
only
child
senor
he
said
it
will
take
you
but
six
hours
in
all
my
wife
counts
the
moments
till
you
come
if
the
child
dies
she
will
no
no
the
doctor
was
weary
of
being
importuned
tell
the
man
it
is
impossible
i
soon
have
my
hands
full
if
i
began
to
go
about
the
country
this
way
they
be
sending
for
me
down
to
agua
caliente
next
and
bringing
up
their
ponies
to
carry
he
will
not
go
asked
alessandro
the
interpreter
shook
his
head
he
can
not
he
said
without
a
word
alessandro
left
the
room
presently
he
returned
ask
him
if
he
will
come
for
money
he
said
i
have
gold
at
home
i
will
pay
him
what
the
white
men
pay
tell
him
no
man
of
any
color
could
pay
me
for
going
sixty
miles
said
the
doctor
and
alessandro
departed
again
walking
so
slowly
however
that
he
heard
the
coarse
laugh
and
the
words
gold
looked
like
it
did
he
which
followed
his
departure
from
the
room
when
ramona
saw
him
returning
alone
she
wrung
her
hands
her
heart
seemed
breaking
the
baby
had
lain
in
a
sort
of
stupor
since
noon
she
was
plainly
worse
and
ramona
had
been
going
from
the
door
to
the
cradle
from
the
cradle
to
the
door
for
an
hour
looking
each
moment
for
the
aid
it
had
not
once
crossed
her
mind
that
the
doctor
would
not
come
she
had
accepted
in
much
fuller
faith
than
alessandro
the
account
of
the
appointment
by
the
government
of
these
two
men
to
look
after
the
indians
interests
what
else
could
their
coming
mean
except
that
at
last
the
indians
were
to
have
justice
she
thought
in
her
simplicity
that
the
doctor
must
have
died
since
alessandro
was
riding
home
alone
he
would
not
come
said
alessandro
as
he
threw
himself
off
his
horse
wearily
would
not
cried
ramona
would
not
did
you
not
say
the
government
had
sent
him
to
be
the
doctor
for
indians
that
was
what
they
said
he
replied
you
see
it
is
a
lie
like
the
rest
but
i
offered
him
gold
and
he
would
not
come
then
the
child
must
die
majella
she
shall
not
die
cried
ramona
we
will
carry
her
to
him
the
thought
struck
them
both
as
an
inspiration
why
had
they
not
thought
of
it
before
you
can
fasten
the
cradle
on
baba
back
and
he
will
go
so
gently
she
will
think
it
is
but
play
and
i
will
walk
by
her
side
or
you
all
the
way
she
continued
and
we
can
sleep
at
aunt
ri
house
oh
why
why
did
we
not
do
it
before
early
in
the
morning
we
will
all
through
the
night
they
sat
watching
the
little
creature
if
they
had
ever
seen
death
they
would
have
known
that
there
was
no
hope
for
the
child
but
how
should
ramona
and
alessandro
know
the
sun
rose
bright
and
warm
before
it
was
up
the
cradle
was
ready
ingeniously
strapped
on
baba
back
when
the
baby
was
placed
in
it
she
smiled
the
first
smile
she
has
given
for
days
cried
ramona
oh
the
air
itself
will
do
good
to
her
let
me
walk
by
her
first
come
baba
dear
baba
and
ramona
stepped
almost
joyfully
by
the
horse
side
alessandro
riding
benito
as
they
paced
along
their
eyes
never
leaving
the
baby
face
ramona
said
in
a
low
tone
alessandro
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
you
what
i
have
done
i
took
the
little
jesus
out
of
the
madonna
arms
and
hid
it
did
you
never
hear
that
if
you
do
that
the
madonna
will
grant
you
anything
to
get
him
back
again
in
her
arms
did
you
ever
hear
of
it
never
exclaimed
alessandro
with
horror
in
his
tone
never
majella
how
dared
you
i
dare
anything
now
said
ramona
i
have
been
thinking
to
do
it
for
some
days
and
to
tell
her
she
could
not
have
him
any
more
till
she
gave
me
back
the
baby
well
and
strong
but
i
knew
i
could
not
have
courage
to
sit
and
look
at
her
all
lonely
without
him
in
her
arms
so
i
did
not
do
it
but
now
we
are
to
be
away
i
thought
that
is
the
time
and
i
told
her
we
come
back
with
our
baby
well
you
shall
have
your
little
jesus
again
too
now
holy
mother
you
go
with
us
and
make
the
doctor
cure
our
baby
oh
i
have
heard
many
times
women
tell
the
senora
they
had
done
this
and
always
they
got
what
they
wanted
never
will
she
let
the
jesus
be
out
of
her
arms
more
than
three
weeks
before
she
will
grant
any
prayer
one
can
make
it
was
that
way
she
brought
you
to
me
alessandro
i
never
before
told
you
i
was
afraid
i
think
she
had
brought
you
sooner
but
i
could
keep
the
little
jesus
hid
from
her
only
at
night
in
the
day
i
could
not
because
the
senora
would
see
so
she
did
not
miss
him
so
much
else
she
had
brought
you
but
majella
said
the
logical
alessandro
it
was
because
i
could
not
leave
my
father
that
i
did
not
come
as
soon
as
he
was
buried
i
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
virgin
you
would
never
have
come
at
all
said
ramona
confidently
for
the
first
hour
of
this
sad
journey
it
seemed
as
if
the
child
were
really
rallying
the
air
the
sunlight
the
novel
motion
the
smiling
mother
by
her
side
the
big
black
horses
she
had
already
learned
to
love
all
roused
her
to
an
animation
she
had
not
shown
for
days
but
it
was
only
the
last
flicker
of
the
expiring
flame
the
eyes
drooped
closed
a
strange
pallor
came
over
the
face
alessandro
saw
it
first
he
was
now
walking
ramona
riding
benito
majella
he
cried
in
a
tone
which
told
her
all
in
a
second
she
was
at
the
baby
side
with
a
cry
which
smote
the
dying
child
consciousness
once
more
the
eyelids
lifted
she
knew
her
mother
a
swift
spasm
shook
the
little
frame
a
convulsion
as
of
agony
swept
over
the
face
then
it
was
at
peace
ramona
shrieks
were
fiercely
she
put
alessandro
away
from
her
as
he
strove
to
caress
her
she
stretched
her
arms
up
towards
the
sky
i
have
killed
her
i
have
killed
her
she
cried
oh
let
me
die
slowly
alessandro
turned
baba
head
homeward
again
oh
give
her
to
me
let
her
lie
on
my
breast
i
will
hold
her
warm
gasped
ramona
silently
alessandro
laid
the
body
in
her
arms
he
had
not
spoken
since
his
first
cry
of
alarm
if
ramona
had
looked
at
him
she
would
have
forgotten
her
grief
for
her
dead
child
alessandro
face
seemed
turned
to
stone
when
they
reached
the
house
ramona
laying
the
child
on
the
bed
ran
hastily
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
lifting
the
deerskin
drew
from
its
the
little
wooden
jesus
with
tears
streaming
she
laid
it
again
in
the
madonna
arms
and
flinging
herself
on
her
knees
sobbed
out
prayers
for
forgiveness
alessandro
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
his
arms
folded
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
child
soon
he
went
out
still
without
speaking
presently
ramona
heard
the
sound
of
a
saw
she
groaned
aloud
and
her
tears
flowed
faster
alessandro
was
making
the
coffin
mechanically
she
rose
and
moving
like
one
half
paralyzed
she
dressed
the
little
one
in
fresh
white
clothes
for
the
burial
then
laying
her
in
the
cradle
she
spread
over
it
the
beautiful
as
she
adjusted
its
folds
her
mind
was
carried
back
to
the
time
when
she
embroidered
it
sitting
on
the
senora
veranda
the
song
of
the
finches
the
linnets
the
voice
and
smile
of
felipe
alessandro
sitting
on
the
steps
drawing
divine
music
from
his
violin
was
that
she
that
girl
who
sat
there
weaving
the
fine
threads
in
the
beautiful
was
it
a
hundred
years
ago
was
it
another
world
was
it
alessandro
yonder
driving
those
nails
into
a
coffin
how
the
blows
rang
louder
and
louder
the
air
seemed
deafening
full
of
sound
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
temples
ramona
sank
to
the
floor
a
merciful
unconsciousness
set
her
free
for
an
interval
from
her
anguish
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
alessandro
had
lifted
her
and
laid
her
there
making
no
effort
to
rouse
her
he
thought
she
would
die
too
and
even
that
thought
did
not
stir
him
from
his
lethargy
when
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
he
did
not
speak
she
closed
them
he
did
not
move
presently
she
opened
them
again
i
heard
you
out
there
she
said
yes
he
replied
it
is
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
box
of
rough
boards
by
the
side
of
the
cradle
is
majella
ready
to
go
to
the
mountain
now
he
asked
yes
alessandro
i
am
ready
she
said
we
will
hide
forever
he
said
it
makes
no
difference
she
replied
the
saboba
women
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
ramona
now
she
had
never
come
into
sympathetic
relations
with
them
as
she
had
with
the
women
of
san
pasquale
her
intimacy
with
the
hyers
had
been
a
barrier
the
saboba
people
could
not
surmount
no
one
could
be
on
such
terms
with
whites
and
be
at
heart
an
indian
they
thought
so
they
held
aloof
from
ramona
but
now
in
her
bereavement
they
gathered
round
her
they
wept
at
sight
of
the
dead
baby
face
lying
in
its
tiny
white
coffin
ramona
had
covered
the
box
with
white
cloth
and
the
lace
thrown
over
it
fell
in
folds
to
the
floor
why
does
not
this
mother
weep
is
she
like
the
whites
who
have
no
heart
said
the
saboba
mothers
among
themselves
and
they
were
embarrassed
before
her
and
knew
not
what
to
say
ramona
perceived
it
but
had
no
life
in
her
to
speak
to
them
benumbing
terrors
which
were
worse
than
her
grief
were
crowding
ramona
heart
now
she
had
offended
the
virgin
she
had
committed
a
blasphemy
in
one
short
hour
the
virgin
had
punished
her
had
smitten
her
child
dead
before
her
eyes
and
now
alessandro
was
going
mad
hour
by
hour
ramona
fancied
she
saw
changes
in
him
what
form
would
the
virgin
vengeance
take
next
would
she
let
alessandro
become
a
raging
madman
and
finally
kill
both
himself
and
her
that
seemed
to
ramona
the
most
probable
fate
in
store
for
them
when
the
funeral
was
over
and
they
returned
to
their
desolate
home
at
the
sight
of
the
empty
cradle
ramona
broke
down
oh
take
me
away
alessandro
anywhere
i
do
care
where
anywhere
so
it
is
not
here
she
cried
would
majella
be
afraid
now
on
the
high
mountain
the
place
i
told
her
of
he
said
no
she
replied
earnestly
no
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
only
take
me
away
a
gleam
of
wild
delight
flitted
across
alessandro
face
it
is
well
he
said
my
majella
we
will
go
to
the
mountain
we
will
be
safe
the
same
fierce
restlessness
which
took
possession
of
him
at
san
pasquale
again
showed
itself
in
his
every
act
his
mind
was
unceasingly
at
work
planning
the
details
of
their
move
and
of
the
new
life
he
mentioned
them
one
after
another
to
ramona
they
could
not
take
both
horses
feed
would
be
scanty
there
and
there
would
be
no
need
of
two
horses
the
cow
also
they
must
give
up
alessandro
would
kill
her
and
the
meat
dried
would
last
them
for
a
long
time
the
wagon
he
hoped
he
could
sell
and
he
would
buy
a
few
sheep
sheep
and
goats
could
live
well
in
these
heights
to
which
they
were
going
safe
at
last
oh
yes
very
safe
not
only
against
whites
who
because
the
little
valley
was
so
small
and
bare
would
not
desire
it
but
against
indians
also
for
the
indians
silly
things
had
a
terror
of
the
upper
heights
of
san
jacinto
they
believed
the
devil
lived
there
and
money
would
not
hire
one
of
the
saboba
indians
to
go
so
high
as
this
valley
which
alessandro
had
discovered
fiercely
he
gloated
over
each
one
of
these
features
of
safety
in
their
the
first
time
i
saw
it
majella
i
believe
the
saints
led
me
there
i
said
it
is
a
and
then
i
never
thought
i
would
be
in
want
of
such
of
a
place
to
keep
my
majella
safe
safe
oh
my
majel
and
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
with
a
terrifying
passion
for
an
indian
to
sell
a
horse
and
wagon
in
the
san
jacinto
valley
was
not
an
easy
thing
unless
he
would
give
them
away
alessandro
had
hard
work
to
give
civil
answers
to
the
men
who
wished
to
buy
benito
and
the
wagon
for
quarter
of
their
value
he
knew
they
would
not
have
dared
to
so
much
as
name
such
prices
to
a
white
man
finally
ramona
who
had
felt
unconquerable
misgivings
as
to
the
wisdom
of
thus
irrevocably
parting
from
their
most
valuable
possessions
persuaded
him
to
take
both
horses
and
wagon
to
san
bernardino
and
offer
them
to
the
hyers
to
use
for
the
winter
it
would
be
just
the
work
for
jos
to
keep
him
in
the
open
air
if
he
could
get
teaming
to
do
she
was
sure
he
would
be
thankful
for
the
chance
he
is
as
fond
of
the
horses
as
we
are
ourselves
alessandro
she
said
they
would
be
well
cared
for
and
then
if
we
did
not
like
living
on
the
mountain
we
could
have
the
horses
and
wagon
again
when
we
came
down
or
jos
could
sell
them
for
us
in
san
bernardino
nobody
could
see
benito
and
baba
working
together
and
not
want
majella
is
wiser
than
the
dove
cried
alessandro
she
has
seen
what
is
the
best
thing
to
do
i
will
take
when
he
was
ready
to
set
off
he
implored
ramona
to
go
with
him
but
with
a
look
of
horror
she
refused
never
she
cried
one
step
on
that
accursed
road
i
will
never
go
on
that
road
again
unless
it
is
to
be
carried
as
we
brought
her
neither
did
ramona
wish
to
see
aunt
ri
her
sympathy
would
be
intolerable
spite
of
all
its
affectionate
kindliness
tell
her
i
love
her
she
said
but
i
do
not
want
to
see
a
human
being
yet
next
year
perhaps
we
will
go
down
if
there
is
any
other
way
besides
that
aunt
ri
was
deeply
grieved
she
could
not
understand
ramona
feeling
it
rankled
deep
i
allow
i
never
hev
bleeved
it
uv
her
never
she
said
i

feelin
abaout

like
she

klar
out
this
yer
world
inter
the
majestic
bulwark
of
san
jacinto
mountain
looms
in
the
southern
horizon
of
the
san
bernardino
valley
it
was
in
full
sight
from
the
door
of
the
little
shanty
in
which
aunt
ri
stood
as
she
sat
there
hour
after
hour
sometimes
seven
hours
to
the
day
working
the
heavy
treadle
and
slipping
the
shuttle
back
and
forth
she
gazed
with
tender
yearnings
at
the
solemn
shining
summit
when
sunset
colors
smote
it
it
glowed
like
fire
on
cloudy
days
it
was
lost
in
the
clouds
like
was
next
door
to
heaven
up
there
jos
aunt

indeed
a
godsend
to

the
very
thing
he
had
been
longing
for
the
only
sort
of
work
he
was
as
yet
strong
enough
to
do
and
there
was
plenty
of
it
to
be
had
in
san
bernardino
but
the
purchase
of
a
wagon
suitable
for
the
purpose
was
at
present
out
of
their
power
the
utmost
aunt
ri
had
hoped
to
accomplish
was
to
have
at
the
end
of
a
year
a
sufficient
sum
laid
up
to
buy
one
they
had
tried
in
vain
to
exchange
their
heavy
for
one
suitable
for
light
work

no
chance
alessandro
had
put
off
from
day
to
day
the
killing
of
the
cow
it
went
hard
with
him
to
slaughter
the
faithful
creature
who
knew
him
and
came
towards
him
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
he
had
pastured
her
since
the
baby
died
in
a
canon
about
three
miles
northeast
of
the
village
a
lovely
green
canon
with
and
a
running
brook
it
was
here
that
he
had
thought
of
building
his
house
if
they
had
stayed
in
saboba
but
alessandro
laughed
bitterly
to
himself
now
as
he
recalled
that
dream
already
the
news
had
come
to
saboba
that
a
company
had
been
formed
for
the
settling
up
of
the
san
jacinto
valley
the
ravallo
brothers
had
sold
to
this
company
a
large
grant
of
land
the
white
ranchmen
in
the
valley
were
all
fencing
in
their
lands
no
more
free
running
of
stock
the
saboba
people
were
too
poor
to
build
miles
of
fencing
they
must
soon
give
up
keeping
stock
and
the
next
thing
would
be
that
they
would
be
driven
out
like
the
people
of
temecula
it
was
none
too
soon
that
he
had
persuaded
majella
to
flee
to
the
mountain
there
at
least
they
could
live
and
die
in
peace
a
life
and
the
loneliest
of
deaths
but
they
would
have
each
other
it
was
well
the
baby
had
died
she
was
saved
all
this
misery
by
the
time
she
had
grown
to
be
a
woman
if
she
had
lived
there
would
be
no
place
in
all
the
country
where
an
indian
could
find
refuge
brooding
over
such
thoughts
as
these
alessandro
went
up
into
the
canon
one
morning
it
must
be
done
everything
was
ready
for
their
move
it
would
take
many
days
to
carry
even
their
few
possessions
up
the
steep
mountain
trail
to
their
new
home
the
pony
which
had
replaced
benito
and
baba
could
not
carry
a
heavy
load
while
this
was
being
done
ramona
would
dry
the
beef
which
would
be
their
supply
of
meat
for
many
months
then
they
would
go
at
noon
he
came
down
with
the
first
load
of
the
meat
and
ramona
began
cutting
it
into
long
strips
as
is
the
mexican
fashion
of
drying
alessandro
returned
for
the
remainder
early
in
the
afternoon
as
ramona
went
to
and
fro
about
her
work
she
saw
a
group
of
horsemen
riding
from
house
to
house
in
the
upper
part
of
the
village
women
came
running
out
excitedly
from
each
house
as
the
horsemen
left
it
finally
one
of
them
darted
swiftly
up
the
hill
to
ramona
hide
it
hide
it
she
cried
breathless
hide
the
meat
it
is
merrill
men
from
the
end
of
the
valley
they
have
lost
a
steer
and
they
say
we
stole
it
they
found
the
place
with
blood
on
it
where
it
was
killed
and
they
say
we
did
it
oh
hide
the
meat
they
took
all
that
fernando
had
and
it
was
his
own
that
he
bought
he
did
not
know
anything
about
their
steer
i
shall
not
hide
it
cried
ramona
indignantly
it
is
our
own
cow
alessandro
killed
it
they
wo
believe
you
said
the
woman
in
distress
they
take
it
all
away
oh
hide
some
of
it
and
she
dragged
a
part
of
it
across
the
floor
and
threw
it
under
the
bed
ramona
standing
by
stupefied
before
she
had
spoken
again
the
forms
of
the
galloping
riders
darkened
the
doorway
the
foremost
of
them
leaping
off
his
horse
exclaimed
by
god
here
the
rest
of
it
if
they
ai
the
damnedest
impudent
thieves
look
at
this
woman
cutting
it
up
put
that
down
will
you
we
save
you
the
trouble
of
dryin
our
meat
for
us
besides
it
fork
over
now
every
bit
you
got
you
and
he
called
ramona
by
a
vile
epithet
every
drop
of
blood
left
ramona
face
her
eyes
blazed
and
she
came
forward
with
the
knife
uplifted
in
her
hand
out
of
my
house
you
dogs
of
the
white
color
she
said
this
meat
is
our
own
my
husband
killed
the
creature
but
this
her
tone
and
bearing
surprised
them
there
were
six
of
the
men
and
they
had
all
swarmed
into
the
little
room
i
say
merrill
said
one
of
them
hold
on
the
squaw
says
her
husband
only
jest
killed
it
it
might
be
ramona
turned
on
him
like
lightning
are
you
liars
you
all
she
cried
that
you
think
i
lie
i
tell
you
the
meat
is
ours
and
there
is
not
an
indian
in
this
village
would
steal
cattle
a
derisive
shout
of
laughter
from
all
the
men
greeted
this
speech
and
at
that
second
the
leader
seeing
the
mark
of
blood
where
the
indian
woman
had
dragged
the
meat
across
the
ground
sprang
to
the
bed
and
lifting
the
deerskin
pointed
with
a
sneer
to
the
beef
hidden
there
perhaps
when
you
know
injun
well
i
do
he
said
you
wo
be
for
believin
all
they
say
what
she
got
it
hid
under
the
bed
for
if
it
was
their
own
cow
and
he
stooped
to
drag
the
meat
out
give
us
a
hand
here
jake
if
you
touch
it
i
will
kill
you
cried
ramona
beside
herself
with
rage
and
she
sprang
between
the
men
her
uplifted
knife
gleaming
cried
jake
stepping
back
that
a
handsome
squaw
when
she
mad
say
boys
let
leave
her
some
of
the
meat
she
was
to
blame
of
course
she
believes
what
her
husband
told
you
go
to
grass
for
a
you
jake
muttered
merrill
as
he
dragged
the
meat
out
from
beneath
the
bed
what
is
all
this
said
a
deep
voice
in
the
door
and
ramona
turning
with
a
glad
cry
saw
alessandro
standing
there
looking
on
with
an
expression
which
even
in
her
own
terror
and
indignation
gave
her
a
sense
of
dread
it
was
so
icily
defiant
he
had
his
hand
on
his
gun
what
is
all
this
he
repeated
he
knew
very
well
it
that
temecula
man
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
low
tone
to
merrill
if
i
known
was
his
house
i
would
have
let
you
come
here
you
up
the
wrong
tree
sure
merrill
dropped
the
meat
he
was
dragging
over
the
floor
and
turned
to
confront
alessandro
eyes
his
countenance
fell
even
he
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
he
began
to
speak
alessandro
interrupted
him
alessandro
could
speak
forcibly
in
spanish
pointing
to
his
pony
which
stood
at
the
door
with
a
package
on
its
back
the
remainder
of
the
meat
rolled
in
the
hide
he
said
there
is
the
remainder
of
the
beef
i
killed
the
creature
this
morning
in
the
canon
i
will
take
senor
merrill
to
the
place
if
he
wishes
it
senor
merrill
steer
was
killed
down
in
the
willows
yonder
that
so
cried
the
men
gathering
around
him
how
did
you
know
who
did
it
alessandro
made
no
reply
he
was
looking
at
ramona
she
had
flung
her
shawl
over
her
head
as
the
other
woman
had
done
and
the
two
were
cowering
in
the
corner
their
faces
turned
away
ramona
dared
not
look
on
she
felt
sure
alessandro
would
kill
some
one
but
this
was
not
the
type
of
outrage
that
roused
alessandro
to
dangerous
wrath
he
even
felt
a
certain
enjoyment
in
the
discomfiture
of
the
posse
of
searchers
for
stolen
goods
to
all
their
questions
in
regard
to
the
stolen
steer
he
maintained
silence
he
would
not
open
his
lips
at
last
angry
ashamed
with
a
volley
of
coarse
oaths
at
him
for
his
obstinacy
they
rode
away
alessandro
went
to
ramona
side
she
was
trembling
her
hands
were
like
ice
let
us
go
to
the
mountain
she
gasped
take
me
where
i
need
never
see
a
white
face
again
a
melancholy
joy
gleamed
in
alessandro
eyes
ramona
at
last
felt
as
he
did
i
would
not
dare
to
leave
majella
there
alone
while
there
is
no
house
he
said
and
i
must
go
and
come
many
times
before
all
the
things
can
be
it
will
be
less
danger
there
than
here
alessandro
said
ramona
bursting
into
violent
weeping
as
she
recalled
the
insolent
leer
with
which
the
man
jake
had
looked
at
her
oh
i
can
not
stay
here
it
will
not
be
many
days
my
majel
i
will
borrow
fernando
pony
to
take
double
at
once
then
we
can
go
who
was
it
stole
that
man
steer
said
ramona
why
did
you
not
tell
them
they
looked
as
if
they
would
kill
it
was
that
mexican
that
lives
in
the
bottom
jose
castro
i
myself
came
on
him
cutting
the
steer
up
he
said
it
was
his
but
i
knew
very
well
by
the
way
he
spoke
he
was
lying
but
why
should
i
tell
they
think
only
indians
will
steal
cattle
i
can
tell
them
the
mexicans
steal
i
told
them
there
was
not
an
indian
in
this
village
would
steal
cattle
said
ramona
indignantly
that
was
not
true
majella
replied
alessandro
sadly
when
they
are
very
hungry
they
will
steal
a
heifer
or
steer
they
lose
many
themselves
and
they
say
it
is
not
so
much
harm
to
take
one
when
they
can
get
it
this
man
merrill
they
say
branded
twenty
steers
for
his
own
last
spring
when
he
knew
they
were
saboba
cattle
why
did
they
not
make
him
give
them
up
cried
ramona
did
not
majella
see
why
they
can
do
nothing
there
is
no
help
for
us
majella
only
to
hide
that
is
all
we
can
do
a
new
terror
had
entered
into
ramona
life
she
dared
not
tell
it
to
alessandro
she
hardly
put
it
into
words
in
her
thoughts
but
she
was
haunted
by
the
face
of
the
man
jake
as
by
a
vision
of
evil
and
on
one
pretext
and
another
she
contrived
to
secure
the
presence
of
some
one
of
the
indian
women
in
her
house
whenever
alessandro
was
away
every
day
she
saw
the
man
riding
past
once
he
had
galloped
up
to
the
open
door
looked
in
spoken
in
a
friendly
way
to
her
and
ridden
on
instinct
was
right
jake
was
merely
biding
his
time
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
settle
in
the
san
jacinto
valley
at
least
for
a
few
years
and
he
wished
to
have
an
indian
woman
come
to
live
with
him
and
keep
his
house
over
in
santa
ysabel
his
brother
had
lived
in
that
way
with
an
indian
mistress
for
three
years
and
when
he
sold
out
and
left
santa
ysabel
he
had
given
the
woman
a
hundred
dollars
and
a
little
house
for
herself
and
her
child
and
she
was
not
only
satisfied
but
held
herself
in
consequence
of
this
temporary
connection
with
a
white
man
much
above
her
indian
relatives
and
friends
when
an
indian
man
had
wished
to
marry
her
she
had
replied
scornfully
that
she
would
never
marry
an
indian
she
might
marry
another
white
man
but
an
indian
never
nobody
had
held
his
brother
in
any
less
esteem
for
this
connection
it
was
quite
the
way
in
the
country
and
if
jake
could
induce
this
handsomest
squaw
he
had
ever
seen
to
come
and
live
with
him
in
a
smaller
fashion
he
would
consider
himself
a
lucky
man
and
also
think
he
was
doing
a
good
thing
for
the
squaw
it
was
all
very
clear
and
simple
in
his
mind
and
when
seeing
ramona
walking
alone
in
the
village
one
morning
he
overtook
her
and
walking
by
her
side
began
to
sound
her
on
the
subject
he
had
small
misgivings
as
to
the
result
ramona
trembled
as
he
approached
her
she
walked
faster
and
would
not
look
at
him
but
he
in
his
ignorance
misinterpreted
these
signs
egregiously
are
you
married
to
your
husband
he
finally
said
it
is
but
a
poor
place
he
gives
you
to
live
in
if
you
will
come
and
live
with
me
you
shall
have
the
best
house
in
the
valley
as
good
as
the
ravallos
and
jake
did
not
finish
his
sentence
with
a
cry
which
haunted
his
memory
for
years
ramona
sprang
from
his
side
as
if
to
run
then
halting
suddenly
she
faced
him
her
eyes
like
javelins
her
breath
coming
fast
beast
she
said
and
spat
towards
him
then
turned
and
fled
to
the
nearest
house
where
she
sank
on
the
floor
and
burst
into
tears
saying
that
the
man
below
there
in
the
road
had
been
rude
to
her
yes
the
women
said
he
was
a
bad
man
they
all
knew
it
of
this
ramona
said
no
word
to
alessandro
she
dared
not
she
believed
he
would
kill
jake
when
the
furious
jake
confided
to
his
friend
merrill
his
repulse
and
the
indignity
accompanying
it
merrill
only
laughed
at
him
and
said
i
could
have
told
you
better
than
to
try
that
woman
she
married
fast
enough
there
plenty
you
can
get
though
if
you
want
about
a
house
and
jest
faithful
dogs
you
can
trust
with
every
dollar
you
from
this
day
ramona
never
knew
an
instant
peace
or
rest
till
she
stood
on
the
rim
of
the
refuge
valley
high
on
san
jacinto
then
gazing
around
looking
up
at
the
lofty
pinnacles
above
which
seemed
to
pierce
the
sky
looking
down
upon
the
world
it
seemed
the
whole
world
so
limitless
it
stretched
away
at
her
feet
feeling
that
infinite
unspeakable
sense
of
nearness
to
heaven
remoteness
from
earth
which
comes
only
on
mountain
heights
she
drew
in
a
long
breath
of
delight
and
cried
at
last
at
last
alessandro
here
we
are
safe
this
is
freedom
this
is
joy
can
majella
be
content
he
asked
i
can
almost
be
glad
alessandro
she
cried
inspired
by
the
glorious
scene
i
dreamed
not
it
was
like
this
it
was
a
wondrous
valley
the
mountain
seemed
to
have
been
cleft
to
make
it
it
lay
near
midway
to
the
top
and
ran
transversely
on
the
mountain
side
its
western
or
southwestern
end
being
many
feet
lower
than
the
eastern
both
the
upper
and
lower
ends
were
closed
by
piles
of
rocks
and
tangled
fallen
trees
the
rocky
summit
of
the
mountain
itself
made
the
southern
wall
the
northern
was
a
spur
or
ridge
nearly
vertical
and
covered
thick
with
a
man
might
roam
years
on
the
mountain
and
not
find
this
cleft
at
the
upper
end
gushed
out
a
crystal
spring
which
trickled
rather
than
ran
in
a
bed
of
marshy
green
the
entire
length
of
the
valley
disappeared
in
the
rocks
at
the
lower
end
and
came
out
no
more
many
times
alessandro
had
searched
for
it
lower
down
but
could
find
no
trace
of
it
during
the
summer
when
he
was
hunting
with
jeff
he
had
several
times
climbed
the
wall
and
descended
it
on
the
inner
side
to
see
if
the
rivulet
still
ran
and
to
his
joy
had
found
it
the
same
in
july
as
in
january
drought
could
not
harm
it
then
what
salvation
in
such
a
spring
and
the
water
was
pure
and
sweet
as
if
it
came
from
the
skies
a
short
distance
off
was
another
ridge
or
spur
of
the
mountain
widening
out
into
almost
a
plateau
this
was
covered
with
oaks
and
under
them
were
flat
stones
worn
into
hollows
where
bygone
generations
of
indians
had
ground
the
nuts
into
meal
generations
long
bygone
indeed
for
it
was
not
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
now
living
that
indians
had
ventured
so
high
up
as
this
on
san
jacinto
it
was
held
to
be
certain
death
to
climb
to
its
summit
and
foolhardy
in
the
extreme
to
go
far
up
its
sides
there
was
exhilaration
in
the
place
it
brought
healing
to
both
alessandro
and
ramona
even
the
bitter
grief
for
the
baby
death
was
soothed
she
did
not
seem
so
far
off
since
they
had
come
so
much
nearer
to
the
sky
they
lived
at
first
in
a
tent
no
time
to
build
a
house
till
the
wheat
and
vegetables
were
planted
alessandro
was
surprised
when
he
came
to
the
ploughing
to
see
how
much
good
land
he
had
the
valley
thrust
itself
in
inlets
and
coves
into
the
very
rocks
of
its
southern
wall
lovely
sheltered
nooks
these
were
where
he
hated
to
wound
the
soft
sward
with
his
plough
as
soon
as
the
planting
was
done
he
began
to
fell
trees
for
the
house
no
mournful
gray
adobe
this
time
but
walls
of
hewn
pine
with
half
the
bark
left
on
alternate
yellow
and
brown
as
gay
as
if
glad
hearts
had
devised
it
the
roof
of
thatch
tule
and
double
laid
and
thick
was
carried
out
several
feet
in
front
of
the
house
making
a
sort
of
veranda
supported
by
young
stems
left
rough
once
more
ramona
would
sit
under
a
thatch
with
in
it
a
little
corral
for
the
sheep
and
a
rough
shed
for
the
pony
and
the
home
was
complete
far
the
prettiest
home
they
had
ever
had
and
here
in
the
sunny
veranda
when
autumn
came
sat
ramona
plaiting
out
of
fragrant
willow
twigs
a
cradle
the
one
over
which
she
had
wept
such
bitter
tears
in
the
valley
they
had
burned
the
night
before
they
left
their
saboba
home
it
was
in
early
autumn
she
sat
plaiting
this
cradle
the
ground
around
was
strewn
with
wild
grapes
drying
the
bees
were
feasting
on
them
in
such
clouds
that
ramona
rose
frequently
from
her
work
to
drive
them
away
saying
as
she
did
so
good
bees
make
our
honey
from
something
else
we
gain
nothing
if
you
drain
our
grapes
for
it
we
want
these
grapes
for
the
winter
and
as
she
spoke
her
imagination
sped
fleetly
forward
to
the
winter
the
virgin
must
have
forgiven
her
to
give
her
again
the
joy
of
a
child
in
her
arms
ay
a
joy
spite
of
poverty
spite
of
danger
spite
of
all
that
cruelty
and
oppression
could
do
it
would
still
be
a
joy
to
hold
her
child
in
her
arms
the
baby
was
born
before
winter
came
an
old
indian
woman
the
same
whose
house
they
had
hired
in
saboba
had
come
up
to
live
with
ramona
she
was
friendless
now
her
daughter
having
died
and
she
thankfully
came
to
be
as
a
mother
to
ramona
she
was
ignorant
and
feeble
but
ramona
saw
in
her
always
the
picture
of
what
her
own
mother
might
perchance
be
wandering
suffering
she
knew
not
what
or
where
and
her
yearning
filial
instinct
found
sad
pleasure
in
caring
for
this
lonely
childless
aged
one
ramona
was
alone
with
her
on
the
mountain
at
the
time
of
the
birth
alessandro
had
gone
to
the
valley
to
be
gone
two
days
but
ramona
felt
no
fear
when
alessandro
returned
and
she
laid
the
child
in
his
arms
she
said
with
a
smile
radiant
once
more
like
the
old
smiles
see
beloved
the
virgin
has
forgiven
me
she
has
given
us
a
daughter
again
but
alessandro
did
not
smile
looking
scrutinizingly
into
the
face
he
sighed
and
said
alas
majella
her
eyes
are
like
mine
not
yours
i
am
glad
of
it
cried
ramona
i
was
glad
the
first
minute
i
saw
he
shook
his
head
it
is
an
ill
fate
to
have
the
eyes
of
alessandro
he
said
they
look
ever
on
woe
and
he
laid
the
baby
back
on
breast
and
stood
gazing
sadly
at
her
dear
alessandro
said
ramona
it
is
a
sin
to
always
mourn
father
salvierderra
said
if
we
repined
under
our
crosses
then
a
heavier
cross
would
be
laid
on
us
worse
things
would
yes
he
said
that
is
true
worse
things
will
and
he
walked
away
with
his
head
sunk
deep
on
his
breast
xxiv
there
was
no
real
healing
for
alessandro
his
hurts
had
gone
too
deep
his
passionate
heart
ever
secretly
brooding
on
the
wrongs
he
had
borne
the
hopeless
outlook
for
his
people
in
the
future
and
most
of
all
on
the
probable
destitution
and
suffering
in
store
for
ramona
consumed
itself
as
by
hidden
fires
speech
complaint
active
antagonism
might
have
saved
him
but
all
these
were
foreign
to
his
reticent
repressed
nature
slowly
so
slowly
that
ramona
could
not
tell
on
what
hour
or
what
day
her
terrible
fears
first
changed
to
an
even
more
terrible
certainty
his
brain
gave
way
and
the
thing
in
dread
of
which
he
had
cried
out
the
morning
they
left
san
pasquale
came
upon
him
strangely
enough
and
mercifully
now
that
it
had
really
come
he
did
not
know
it
he
knew
that
he
suddenly
came
to
his
consciousness
sometimes
and
discovered
himself
in
strange
and
unexplained
situations
had
no
recollection
of
what
had
happened
for
an
interval
of
time
longer
or
shorter
but
he
thought
it
was
only
a
sort
of
sickness
he
did
not
know
that
during
those
intervals
his
acts
were
the
acts
of
a
madman
never
violent
aggressive
or
harmful
to
any
one
never
destructive
it
was
piteous
to
see
how
in
these
intervals
his
delusions
were
always
shaped
by
the
bitterest
experiences
of
his
life
sometimes
he
fancied
that
the
americans
were
pursuing
him
or
that
they
were
carrying
off
ramona
and
he
was
pursuing
them
at
such
times
he
would
run
with
maniac
swiftness
for
hours
till
he
fell
exhausted
on
the
ground
and
slowly
regained
true
consciousness
by
exhaustion
at
other
times
he
believed
he
owned
vast
flocks
and
herds
would
enter
any
enclosure
he
saw
where
there
were
sheep
or
cattle
go
about
among
them
speaking
of
them
to
as
his
own
sometimes
he
would
try
to
drive
them
away
but
on
being
remonstrated
with
would
bewilderedly
give
up
the
attempt
once
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
road
driving
a
small
flock
of
goats
whose
he
knew
not
nor
whence
he
got
them
sitting
down
by
the
roadside
he
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
what
has
happened
to
my
memory
he
said
i
must
be
ill
of
a
fever
as
he
sat
there
the
goats
of
their
own
accord
turned
and
trotted
back
into
a
corral
near
by
the
owner
of
which
stood
laughing
on
his
doorsill
and
when
alessandro
came
up
said
goodnaturedly
all
right
alessandro
i
saw
you
driving
off
my
goats
but
i
thought
you
bring
everybody
in
the
valley
knew
him
and
knew
his
condition
it
did
not
interfere
with
his
capacity
as
a
worker
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
was
one
of
the
best
shearers
in
the
region
the
best
and
his
services
were
always
in
demand
spite
of
the
risk
there
was
of
his
having
at
any
time
one
of
these
attacks
of
wandering
his
absences
were
a
great
grief
to
ramona
not
only
from
the
loneliness
in
which
it
left
her
but
from
the
anxiety
she
felt
lest
his
mental
disorder
might
at
any
time
take
a
more
violent
and
dangerous
shape
this
anxiety
was
all
the
more
harrowing
because
she
must
keep
it
locked
in
her
own
breast
her
wise
and
loving
instinct
telling
her
that
nothing
could
be
more
fatal
to
him
than
the
knowledge
of
his
real
condition
more
than
once
he
reached
home
breathless
panting
the
sweat
rolling
off
his
face
crying
aloud
the
americans
have
found
us
out
majella
they
were
on
the
trail
i
baffled
them
i
came
up
another
at
such
times
she
would
soothe
him
like
a
child
persuade
him
to
lie
down
and
rest
and
when
he
waked
and
wondered
why
he
was
so
tired
she
would
say
you
were
all
out
of
breath
when
you
came
in
dear
you
must
not
climb
so
fast
it
is
foolish
to
tire
one
self
in
these
days
ramona
began
to
think
earnestly
of
felipe
she
believed
alessandro
might
be
cured
a
wise
doctor
could
surely
do
something
for
him
if
felipe
knew
what
sore
straits
she
was
in
felipe
would
help
her
but
how
could
she
reach
felipe
without
the
senora
knowing
it
and
still
more
how
could
she
send
a
letter
to
felipe
without
knowing
what
she
had
written
ramona
was
as
helpless
in
her
freedom
on
this
mountain
eyrie
as
if
she
had
been
chained
hand
and
foot
and
so
the
winter
wore
away
and
the
spring
what
wheat
grew
in
their
fields
in
this
upper
air
wild
oats
too
in
every
nook
and
corner
the
goats
frisked
and
fattened
and
their
hair
grew
long
and
silky
the
sheep
were
already
heavy
again
with
wool
and
it
was
not
yet
midsummer
the
spring
rains
had
been
good
the
stream
was
full
and
flowers
grew
along
its
edges
thick
as
in
beds
the
baby
had
thrived
as
placid
laughing
a
little
thing
as
if
its
mother
had
never
known
sorrow
one
would
think
she
had
suckled
pain
thought
ramona
so
constantly
have
i
grieved
this
year
but
the
virgin
has
kept
her
if
prayers
could
compass
it
that
would
surely
have
been
so
for
night
and
day
the
devout
trusting
and
contrite
ramona
had
knelt
before
the
madonna
and
told
her
golden
beads
till
they
were
wellnigh
worn
smooth
of
all
their
delicate
chasing
at
midsummer
was
to
be
a
fete
in
the
saboba
village
and
the
san
bernardino
priest
would
come
there
this
would
be
the
time
to
take
the
baby
down
to
be
christened
this
also
would
be
the
time
to
send
the
letter
to
felipe
enclosed
in
one
to
aunt
ri
who
would
send
it
for
her
from
san
bernardino
ramona
felt
half
guilty
as
she
sat
plotting
what
she
should
say
and
how
she
should
send
it
she
who
had
never
had
in
her
loyal
transparent
breast
one
thought
secret
from
alessandro
since
they
were
wedded
but
it
was
all
for
his
sake
when
he
was
well
he
would
thank
her
she
wrote
the
letter
with
much
study
and
deliberation
her
dread
of
its
being
read
by
the
senora
was
so
great
that
it
almost
paralyzed
her
pen
as
she
wrote
more
than
once
she
destroyed
pages
as
being
too
sacred
a
confidence
for
unloving
eyes
to
read
at
last
the
day
before
the
fete
it
was
done
and
safely
hidden
away
the
baby
white
robe
finely
wrought
in
was
also
done
and
freshly
washed
and
ironed
no
baby
would
there
be
at
the
fete
so
daintily
wrapped
as
hers
and
alessandro
had
at
last
given
his
consent
that
the
name
should
be
majella
it
was
a
reluctant
consent
yielded
finally
only
to
please
ramona
and
contrary
to
her
wont
she
had
been
willing
in
this
instance
to
have
her
own
wish
fulfilled
rather
than
his
her
heart
was
set
upon
having
the
seal
of
baptism
added
to
the
name
she
so
loved
and
if
i
were
to
die
she
thought
how
glad
alessandro
would
be
to
have
still
a
majella
all
her
preparations
were
completed
and
it
was
yet
not
noon
she
seated
herself
on
the
veranda
to
watch
for
alessandro
who
had
been
two
days
away
and
was
to
have
returned
the
previous
evening
to
make
ready
for
the
trip
to
saboba
she
was
disquieted
at
his
failure
to
return
at
the
appointed
time
as
the
hours
crept
on
and
he
did
not
come
her
anxiety
increased
the
sun
had
gone
more
than
an
hour
past
the
midheavens
before
he
came
he
had
ridden
fast
she
had
heard
the
quick
strokes
of
the
horse
hoofs
on
the
ground
before
she
saw
him
why
comes
he
riding
like
that
she
thought
and
ran
to
meet
him
as
he
drew
near
she
saw
to
her
surprise
that
he
was
riding
a
new
horse
why
alessandro
she
cried
what
horse
is
this
he
looked
at
her
bewilderedly
then
at
the
horse
true
it
was
not
his
own
horse
he
struck
his
hand
on
his
forehead
endeavoring
to
collect
his
thoughts
where
is
my
horse
then
he
said
my
god
alessandro
cried
ramona
take
the
horse
back
instantly
they
will
say
you
stole
but
i
left
my
pony
there
in
the
corral
he
said
they
will
know
i
did
not
mean
to
steal
it
how
could
i
ever
have
made
the
mistake
i
recollect
nothing
majella
i
must
have
had
one
of
the
ramona
heart
was
cold
with
fear
only
too
well
she
knew
what
summary
punishment
was
dealt
in
that
region
to
oh
let
me
take
it
back
dear
she
cried
let
me
go
down
with
it
they
will
believe
majella
he
exclaimed
think
you
i
would
send
you
into
the
fold
of
the
wolf
my
it
is
in
jim
farrar
corral
i
left
my
pony
i
was
there
last
night
to
see
about
his
in
the
autumn
and
that
is
the
last
i
know
i
will
ride
back
as
soon
as
i
have
rested
i
am
heavy
with
thinking
it
safer
to
let
him
sleep
for
an
hour
as
his
brain
was
evidently
still
confused
ramona
assented
to
this
though
a
sense
of
danger
oppressed
her
getting
fresh
hay
from
the
corral
she
with
her
own
hands
rubbed
the
horse
down
it
was
a
fine
powerful
black
horse
alessandro
had
evidently
urged
him
cruelly
up
the
steep
trail
for
his
sides
were
steaming
his
nostrils
white
with
foam
tears
stood
in
ramona
eyes
as
she
did
what
she
could
for
him
he
recognized
her
and
put
his
nose
to
her
face
it
must
be
because
he
was
black
like
benito
that
alessandro
took
him
she
thought
oh
mary
mother
help
us
to
get
the
creature
safe
back
she
said
when
she
went
into
the
house
alessandro
was
asleep
ramona
glanced
at
the
sun
it
was
already
in
the
western
sky
by
no
possibility
could
alessandro
go
to
farrar
and
back
before
dark
she
was
on
the
point
of
waking
him
when
a
furious
barking
from
capitan
and
the
other
dogs
roused
him
instantly
from
his
sleep
and
springing
to
his
feet
he
ran
out
to
see
what
it
meant
in
a
moment
more
ramona
followed
only
a
moment
hardly
a
moment
but
when
she
reached
the
threshold
it
was
to
hear
a
to
see
alessandro
fall
to
the
ground
to
see
in
the
same
second
a
ruffianly
man
leap
from
his
horse
and
standing
over
alessandro
body
fire
his
pistol
again
once
twice
into
the
forehead
cheek
then
with
a
volley
of
oaths
each
word
of
which
seemed
to
ramona
reeling
senses
to
fill
the
air
with
a
sound
like
thunder
he
untied
the
black
horse
from
the
post
where
ramona
had
fastened
him
and
leaping
into
his
saddle
again
galloped
away
leading
the
horse
as
he
rode
away
he
shook
his
fist
at
ramona
who
was
kneeling
on
the
ground
striving
to
lift
alessandro
head
and
to
stanch
the
blood
flowing
from
the
ghastly
wounds
that
teach
you
damned
indians
to
leave
off
stealing
our
horses
he
cried
and
with
another
volley
of
terrible
oaths
was
out
of
sight
with
a
calmness
which
was
more
dreadful
than
any
wild
outcry
of
grief
ramona
sat
on
the
ground
by
alessandro
body
and
held
his
hands
in
hers
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
him
the
first
shot
had
been
fatal
close
to
his
heart
the
murderer
aimed
well
the
with
the
pistol
were
from
mere
wanton
brutality
after
a
few
seconds
ramona
rose
went
into
the
house
brought
out
the
white
and
laid
it
over
the
mutilated
face
as
she
did
this
she
recalled
words
she
had
heard
father
salvierderra
quote
as
having
been
said
by
father
junipero
when
one
of
the
franciscan
fathers
had
been
massacred
by
the
indians
at
san
diego
thank
he
said
the
ground
is
now
watered
by
the
blood
of
a
martyr
the
blood
of
a
martyr
the
words
seemed
to
float
in
the
air
to
cleanse
it
from
the
foul
blasphemies
the
murderer
had
spoken
my
alessandro
she
said
gone
to
be
with
the
saints
one
of
the
blessed
martyrs
they
will
listen
to
what
a
martyr
his
hands
were
warm
she
laid
them
in
her
bosom
kissed
them
again
and
again
stretching
herself
on
the
ground
by
his
side
she
threw
one
arm
over
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
my
love
my
alessandro
oh
speak
once
to
majella
why
do
i
not
grieve
more
my
alessandro
is
he
not
blest
already
and
soon
we
will
be
with
him
the
burdens
were
too
great
he
could
not
bear
them
then
waves
of
grief
broke
over
her
and
she
sobbed
convulsively
but
still
she
shed
no
tears
suddenly
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
looked
wildly
around
the
sun
was
not
many
hours
high
whither
should
she
go
for
help
the
old
indian
woman
had
gone
away
with
the
sheep
and
would
not
be
back
till
dark
alessandro
must
not
lie
there
on
the
ground
to
whom
should
she
go
to
walk
to
saboba
was
out
of
the
question
there
was
another
indian
village
nearer
the
village
of
the
cahuillas
on
one
of
the
high
plateaus
of
san
jacinto
she
had
once
been
there
could
she
find
that
trail
now
she
must
try
there
was
no
human
help
nearer
taking
the
baby
in
her
arms
she
knelt
by
alessandro
and
kissing
him
whispered
farewell
my
beloved
i
will
not
be
long
gone
i
go
to
bring
as
she
set
off
swiftly
running
capitan
who
had
been
lying
by
alessandro
side
uttering
howls
bounded
to
his
feet
to
follow
her
no
capitan
she
said
and
leading
him
back
to
the
body
she
took
his
head
in
her
hands
looked
into
his
eyes
and
said
capitan
watch
with
a
whimpering
cry
he
licked
her
hands
and
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
he
understood
and
would
obey
but
his
eyes
followed
her
wistfully
till
she
disappeared
from
sight
the
trail
was
rough
and
hard
to
find
more
than
once
ramona
stopped
baffled
among
the
rocky
ridges
and
precipices
her
clothes
were
torn
her
face
bleeding
from
the
thorny
shrubs
her
feet
seemed
leaden
she
made
her
way
so
slowly
it
was
dark
in
the
ravines
as
she
climbed
spur
after
spur
and
still
saw
nothing
but
pine
forests
or
bleak
opens
her
heart
sank
within
her
the
way
had
not
seemed
so
long
before
alessandro
had
been
with
her
it
was
a
joyous
bright
day
and
they
had
lingered
wherever
they
liked
and
yet
the
way
had
seemed
short
fear
seized
her
that
she
was
lost
if
that
were
so
before
morning
she
would
be
with
alessandro
for
fierce
beasts
roamed
san
jacinto
by
night
but
for
the
baby
sake
she
must
not
die
feverishly
she
pressed
on
at
last
just
as
it
had
grown
so
dark
she
could
see
only
a
few
before
her
and
was
panting
more
from
terror
than
from
running
lights
suddenly
gleamed
out
only
a
few
rods
ahead
it
was
the
cahuilla
village
in
a
few
moments
she
was
there
it
is
a
little
place
the
cahuilla
village
a
cluster
of
tule
and
adobe
huts
on
a
narrow
bit
of
bleak
and
broken
ground
on
san
jacinto
mountain
the
people
are
very
poor
but
are
proud
and
veritable
mountaineers
in
nature
fierce
and
independent
alessandro
had
warm
friends
among
them
and
the
news
that
he
had
been
murdered
and
that
his
wife
had
run
all
the
way
down
the
mountain
with
her
baby
in
her
arms
for
help
went
like
through
the
place
the
people
gathered
in
an
excited
group
around
the
house
where
ramona
had
taken
refuge
she
was
lying
half
unconscious
on
a
bed
as
soon
as
she
had
gasped
out
her
terrible
story
she
had
fallen
forward
on
the
floor
fainting
and
the
baby
had
been
snatched
from
her
arms
just
in
time
to
save
it
she
did
not
seem
to
miss
the
child
had
not
asked
for
it
or
noticed
it
when
it
was
brought
to
the
bed
a
merciful
oblivion
seemed
to
be
fast
stealing
over
her
senses
but
she
had
spoken
words
enough
to
set
the
village
in
a
blaze
of
excitement
it
ran
higher
and
higher
men
were
everywhere
mounting
their
horses
some
to
go
up
and
bring
alessandro
body
down
some
organizing
a
party
to
go
at
once
to
jim
farrar
house
and
shoot
him
these
were
the
younger
men
friends
of
alessandro
earnestly
the
aged
capitan
of
the
village
implored
them
to
refrain
from
such
violence
why
should
ten
be
dead
instead
of
one
my
sons
he
said
will
you
leave
your
wives
and
your
children
like
his
the
whites
will
kill
us
all
if
you
lay
hands
on
the
man
perhaps
they
themselves
will
punish
a
derisive
laugh
rose
from
the
group
never
yet
within
their
experience
had
a
white
man
been
punished
for
shooting
an
indian
the
capitan
knew
that
as
well
as
they
did
why
did
he
command
them
to
sit
still
like
women
and
do
nothing
when
a
friend
was
murdered
because
i
am
old
and
you
are
young
i
have
seen
that
we
fight
in
vain
said
the
wise
old
man
it
is
not
sweet
to
me
any
more
than
to
you
it
is
a
fire
in
my
veins
but
i
am
old
i
have
seen
i
forbid
you
to
the
women
added
their
entreaties
to
his
and
the
young
men
abandoned
their
project
but
it
was
with
sullen
reluctance
and
mutterings
were
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
that
the
time
would
come
yet
there
was
more
than
one
way
of
killing
a
man
farrar
would
not
be
long
seen
in
the
valley
alessandro
should
be
avenged
as
farrar
rode
slowly
down
the
mountain
leading
his
recovered
horse
he
revolved
in
his
thoughts
what
course
to
pursue
a
few
years
before
he
would
have
gone
home
no
more
disquieted
at
having
killed
an
indian
than
if
he
had
killed
a
fox
or
a
wolf
but
things
were
different
now
this
agent
that
the
government
had
taken
it
into
its
head
to
send
out
to
look
after
the
indians
had
made
it
hot
the
other
day
for
some
fellows
in
san
bernardino
who
had
maltreated
an
indian
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
arrest
several
for
simply
selling
whiskey
to
indians
if
he
were
to
take
this
case
of
alessandro
in
hand
it
might
be
troublesome
farrar
concluded
that
his
wisest
course
would
be
to
make
a
show
of
good
conscience
and
by
delivering
himself
up
at
once
to
the
nearest
justice
of
the
peace
as
having
killed
a
man
in
accordingly
he
rode
straight
to
the
house
of
a
judge
wells
a
few
miles
below
saboba
and
said
that
he
wished
to
surrender
himself
as
having
committed
justifiable
homicide
on
an
indian
or
mexican
he
did
net
know
which
who
had
stolen
his
horse
he
told
a
plausible
story
he
professed
not
to
know
the
man
or
the
place
but
did
not
explain
how
it
was
that
knowing
neither
he
had
gone
so
direct
to
the
spot
he
said
i
followed
the
trail
for
some
time
but
when
i
reached
a
turn
i
came
into
a
sort
of
blind
trail
where
i
lost
the
track
i
think
the
horse
had
been
led
up
on
hard
sod
to
mislead
any
one
on
the
track
i
pushed
on
crossed
the
creek
and
soon
found
the
tracks
again
in
soft
ground
this
part
of
the
mountain
was
perfectly
unknown
to
me
and
very
wild
finally
i
came
to
a
ridge
from
which
i
looked
down
on
a
little
ranch
as
i
came
near
the
house
the
dogs
began
to
bark
just
as
i
discovered
my
horse
tied
to
a
tree
hearing
the
dogs
an
indian
or
mexican
i
could
not
tell
which
came
out
of
the
house
flourishing
a
large
knife
i
called
out
to
him
horse
is
that
he
answered
in
spanish
is
mine
did
you
get
it
i
asked
san
jacinto
was
his
reply
as
he
still
came
towards
me
brandishing
the
knife
i
drew
my
gun
and
said
or
i
shoot
he
did
not
stop
and
i
fired
still
he
did
not
stop
so
i
fired
again
and
as
he
did
not
fall
i
knocked
him
down
with
the
butt
of
my
gun
after
he
was
down
i
shot
him
twice
with
my
the
duty
of
a
justice
in
such
a
case
as
this
was
clear
taking
the
prisoner
into
custody
he
sent
out
messengers
to
summon
a
jury
of
six
men
to
hold
inquest
on
the
body
of
said
indian
or
mexican
and
early
the
next
morning
led
by
farrar
they
set
out
for
the
mountain
when
they
reached
the
ranch
the
body
had
been
removed
the
house
was
locked
no
signs
left
of
the
tragedy
of
the
day
before
except
a
few
on
the
ground
where
alessandro
had
fallen
farrar
seemed
greatly
relieved
at
this
unexpected
phase
of
affairs
however
when
he
found
that
judge
wells
instead
of
attempting
to
return
to
the
valley
that
night
proposed
to
pass
the
night
at
a
ranch
only
a
few
miles
from
the
cahuilla
village
he
became
almost
hysterical
with
fright
he
declared
that
the
cahuillas
would
surely
come
and
murder
him
in
the
night
and
begged
piteously
that
the
men
would
all
stay
with
him
to
guard
him
at
midnight
judge
wells
was
roused
by
the
arrival
of
the
capitan
and
head
men
of
the
cahuilla
village
they
had
heard
of
his
arrival
with
his
jury
and
they
had
come
to
lead
them
to
their
village
where
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
lay
they
were
greatly
distressed
on
learning
that
they
ought
not
to
have
removed
the
body
from
the
spot
where
the
death
had
taken
place
and
that
now
no
inquest
could
be
held
judge
wells
himself
however
went
back
with
them
saw
the
body
and
heard
the
full
account
of
the
murder
as
given
by
ramona
on
her
first
arrival
nothing
more
could
now
be
learned
from
her
as
she
was
in
high
fever
and
delirium
knew
no
one
not
even
her
baby
when
they
laid
it
on
her
breast
she
lay
restlessly
tossing
from
side
to
side
talking
incessantly
clasping
her
rosary
in
her
hands
and
constantly
mingling
snatches
of
prayers
with
cries
for
alessandro
and
felipe
the
only
token
of
consciousness
she
gave
was
to
clutch
the
rosary
wildly
and
sometimes
hide
it
in
her
bosom
if
they
attempted
to
take
it
from
her
judge
wells
was
a
frontiersman
and
by
no
means
sentimentally
inclined
but
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
the
unconscious
ramona
farrar
had
pleaded
that
the
preliminary
hearing
might
take
place
immediately
but
after
this
visit
to
the
village
the
judge
refused
his
request
and
appointed
the
trial
a
week
from
that
day
to
give
time
for
ramona
to
recover
and
appear
as
a
witness
he
impressed
upon
the
indians
as
strongly
as
he
could
the
importance
of
having
her
appear
it
was
evident
that
farrar
account
of
the
affair
was
false
from
first
to
last
alessandro
had
no
knife
he
had
not
had
time
to
go
many
steps
from
the
door
the
volley
of
oaths
and
the
two
shots
almost
simultaneously
were
what
ramona
heard
as
she
ran
to
the
door
alessandro
could
not
have
spoken
many
words
the
day
for
the
hearing
came
farrar
had
been
during
the
interval
in
a
merely
nominal
custody
having
been
allowed
to
go
about
his
business
on
his
own
personal
guarantee
of
appearing
in
time
for
the
trial
it
was
with
a
strange
mixture
of
regret
and
relief
that
judge
wells
saw
the
hour
of
the
trial
arrive
and
not
a
witness
on
the
ground
except
farrar
himself
that
farrar
was
a
brutal
ruffian
the
whole
country
knew
this
last
outrage
was
only
one
of
a
long
series
the
judge
would
have
been
glad
to
have
committed
him
for
trial
and
have
seen
him
get
his
deserts
but
san
jacinto
valley
wild
sparsely
settled
as
it
was
had
yet
as
fixed
standards
and
criterions
of
popularity
as
the
most
civilized
of
communities
could
show
and
to
betray
sympathy
with
indians
was
more
than
any
man
political
head
was
worth
the
word
justice
had
lost
its
meaning
if
indeed
it
ever
had
any
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
the
valley
was
a
unit
on
that
question
however
divided
it
might
be
upon
others
on
the
whole
the
judge
was
relieved
though
it
was
not
without
a
bitter
twinge
as
of
one
accessory
after
the
deed
and
unfaithful
to
a
friend
for
he
had
known
alessandro
well
yet
on
the
whole
he
was
relieved
when
he
was
forced
to
accede
to
the
motion
made
by
counsel
that
the
prisoner
be
discharged
on
ground
of
justifiable
homicide
no
witnesses
having
appeared
against
he
comforted
himself
by
thinking
what
was
no
doubt
true
that
even
if
the
case
had
been
brought
to
a
jury
trial
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
for
there
would
never
have
been
found
a
san
diego
county
jury
that
would
convict
a
white
man
of
murder
for
killing
an
indian
if
there
were
no
witnesses
to
the
occurrence
except
the
indian
wife
but
he
derived
small
comfort
from
this
alessandro
face
haunted
him
and
also
the
memory
of
ramona
as
she
lay
tossing
and
moaning
in
the
wretched
cahuilla
hovel
he
knew
that
only
her
continued
illness
or
her
death
could
explain
her
not
having
come
to
the
trial
the
indians
would
have
brought
her
in
their
arms
all
the
way
if
she
had
been
alive
and
in
possession
of
her
senses
during
the
summer
that
she
and
alessandro
had
lived
in
saboba
he
had
seen
her
many
times
and
had
been
impressed
by
her
rare
quality
his
children
knew
her
and
loved
her
had
often
been
in
her
house
his
wife
had
bought
her
embroidery
alessandro
also
had
worked
for
him
and
no
one
knew
better
than
judge
wells
that
alessandro
in
his
senses
was
as
incapable
of
stealing
a
horse
as
any
white
man
in
the
valley
farrar
knew
it
everybody
knew
it
everybody
knew
also
about
his
strange
fits
of
wandering
mind
and
that
when
these
fits
came
on
him
he
was
wholly
irresponsible
farrar
knew
this
the
only
explanation
of
farrar
deed
was
that
on
seeing
his
horse
spent
and
exhausted
from
having
been
forced
up
that
terrible
trail
he
was
seized
by
ungovernable
rage
and
fired
on
the
second
without
knowing
what
he
did
but
he
would
have
done
it
if
it
had
been
an
indian
mused
the
judge
he
ha
thought
twice
before
he
shot
any
white
man
down
that
day
after
day
such
thoughts
as
these
pursued
the
judge
and
he
could
not
shake
them
off
an
uneasy
sense
that
he
owed
something
to
ramona
or
if
ramona
were
dead
to
the
little
child
she
had
left
haunted
him
there
might
in
some
such
way
be
a
sort
of
atonement
made
to
the
murdered
unavenged
alessandro
he
might
even
take
the
child
and
bring
it
up
in
his
own
house
that
was
by
no
means
an
uncommon
thing
in
the
valley
the
longer
he
thought
the
more
he
felt
himself
eased
in
his
mind
by
this
purpose
and
he
decided
that
as
soon
as
he
could
find
leisure
he
would
go
to
the
cahuilla
village
and
see
what
could
be
done
but
it
was
not
destined
that
stranger
hands
should
bring
succor
to
ramona
felipe
had
at
last
found
trace
of
her
felipe
was
on
the
way
xxv
effectually
misled
by
the
faithful
carmena
felipe
had
begun
his
search
for
alessandro
by
going
direct
to
monterey
he
found
few
indians
in
the
place
and
not
one
had
ever
heard
alessandro
name
six
miles
from
the
town
was
a
little
settlement
of
them
in
hiding
in
the
bottoms
of
the
san
carlos
river
near
the
old
mission
the
catholic
priest
advised
him
to
search
there
sometimes
he
said
fugitives
of
one
sort
and
another
took
refuge
in
this
settlement
lived
there
for
a
few
months
then
disappeared
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
come
felipe
searched
there
also
equally
in
vain
he
questioned
all
the
sailors
in
port
all
the
shippers
no
one
had
heard
of
an
indian
shipping
on
board
any
vessel
in
fact
a
captain
would
have
to
be
in
straits
before
he
would
take
an
indian
in
his
crew
but
this
was
an
exceptionally
good
worker
this
indian
he
could
turn
his
hand
to
anything
he
might
have
gone
as
ship
that
might
be
they
said
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
any
such
thing
however
and
very
much
they
all
wondered
what
it
was
that
made
the
handsome
sad
mexican
gentleman
so
anxious
to
find
this
indian
felipe
wasted
weeks
in
monterey
long
after
he
had
ceased
to
hope
he
lingered
he
felt
as
if
he
would
like
to
stay
till
every
ship
that
had
sailed
out
of
monterey
in
the
last
three
years
had
returned
whenever
he
heard
of
one
coming
into
harbor
he
hastened
to
the
shore
and
closely
watched
the
disembarking
his
melancholy
countenance
with
its
eager
searching
look
became
a
familiar
sight
to
every
one
even
the
children
knew
that
the
pale
gentleman
was
looking
for
some
one
he
could
not
find
women
pitied
him
and
gazed
at
him
tenderly
wondering
if
a
man
could
look
like
that
for
anything
save
the
loss
of
a
sweetheart
felipe
made
no
confidences
he
simply
asked
day
after
day
of
every
one
he
met
for
an
indian
named
alessandro
assis
finally
he
shook
himself
free
from
the
dreamy
spell
of
the
place
and
turned
his
face
southward
again
he
went
by
the
route
which
the
franciscan
fathers
used
to
take
when
the
only
road
on
the
california
coast
was
the
one
leading
from
mission
to
mission
felipe
had
heard
father
salvierderra
say
that
there
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
each
of
the
old
missions
indian
villages
or
families
still
living
he
thought
it
not
improbable
that
from
alessandro
father
long
connection
with
the
san
luis
rey
mission
alessandro
might
be
known
to
some
of
these
indians
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
no
indian
village
unsearched
no
indian
unquestioned
san
juan
bautista
came
first
then
soledad
san
antonio
san
miguel
san
luis
obispo
santa
inez
and
that
brought
him
to
santa
barbara
he
had
spent
two
months
on
the
journey
at
each
of
these
places
he
found
indians
miserable
creatures
most
of
them
felipe
heart
ached
and
he
was
hot
with
shame
at
their
condition
the
ruins
of
the
old
mission
buildings
were
sad
to
see
but
the
human
ruins
were
sadder
now
felipe
understood
why
father
salvierderra
heart
had
broken
and
why
his
mother
had
been
full
of
such
fierce
indignation
against
the
heretic
usurpers
and
despoilers
of
the
estates
which
the
franciscans
once
held
he
could
not
understand
why
the
church
had
submitted
without
fighting
to
such
indignities
and
robberies
at
every
one
of
the
missions
he
heard
harrowing
tales
of
the
sufferings
of
those
fathers
who
had
clung
to
their
congregations
to
the
last
and
died
at
their
posts
at
soledad
an
old
indian
weeping
showed
him
the
grave
of
father
sarria
who
had
died
there
of
starvation
he
gave
us
all
he
had
to
the
last
said
the
old
man
he
lay
on
a
on
the
ground
as
we
did
and
one
morning
before
he
had
finished
the
mass
he
fell
forward
at
the
altar
and
was
dead
and
when
we
put
him
in
the
grave
his
body
was
only
bones
and
no
flesh
he
had
gone
so
long
without
food
to
give
it
to
at
all
these
missions
felipe
asked
in
vain
for
alessandro
they
knew
very
little
these
northern
indians
about
those
in
the
south
they
said
it
was
seldom
one
from
the
southern
tribes
came
northward
they
did
not
understand
each
other
speech
the
more
felipe
inquired
and
the
longer
he
reflected
the
more
he
doubted
alessandro
having
ever
gone
to
monterey
at
santa
barbara
he
made
a
long
stay
the
brothers
at
the
college
welcomed
him
hospitably
they
had
heard
from
father
salvierderra
the
sad
story
of
ramona
and
were
distressed
with
felipe
that
no
traces
had
been
found
of
her
it
grieved
father
salvierderra
to
the
last
they
said
he
prayed
for
her
daily
but
said
he
could
not
get
any
certainty
in
his
spirit
of
his
prayers
being
heard
only
the
day
before
he
died
he
had
said
this
to
father
francis
a
young
brazilian
monk
to
whom
he
was
greatly
attached
in
felipe
overwrought
frame
of
mind
this
seemed
to
him
a
terrible
omen
and
he
set
out
on
his
journey
with
a
still
heavier
heart
than
before
he
believed
ramona
was
dead
buried
in
some
unknown
unconsecrated
spot
never
to
be
found
yet
he
would
not
give
up
the
search
as
he
journeyed
southward
he
began
to
find
persons
who
had
known
of
alessandro
and
still
more
those
who
had
known
his
father
old
pablo
but
no
one
had
heard
anything
of
alessandro
whereabouts
since
the
driving
out
of
his
people
from
temecula
there
was
no
knowing
where
any
of
those
temecula
people
were
now
they
had
scattered
like
a
flock
of
ducks
one
indian
said
like
a
flock
of
ducks
after
they
are
fired
into
you
never
see
all
those
ducks
in
any
one
place
again
the
temecula
people
were
here
there
and
everywhere
all
through
san
diego
county
there
was
one
temecula
man
at
san
juan
capistrano
however
the
senor
would
better
see
him
he
no
doubt
knew
about
alessandro
he
was
living
in
a
room
in
the
old
mission
building
the
priest
had
given
it
to
him
for
taking
care
of
the
chapel
and
the
priest
room
and
a
little
rent
besides
he
was
a
hard
man
the
san
juan
capistrano
priest
he
would
take
the
last
dollar
from
a
poor
it
was
late
at
night
when
felipe
reached
san
juan
capistrano
but
he
could
not
sleep
till
he
had
seen
this
man
here
was
the
first
clew
he
had
gained
he
found
the
man
with
his
wife
and
children
in
a
large
corner
room
opening
on
the
inner
court
of
the
mission
quadrangle
the
room
was
dark
and
damp
as
a
cellar
a
fire
smouldered
in
the
enormous
fireplace
a
few
skins
and
rags
were
piled
near
the
hearth
and
on
these
lay
the
woman
evidently
ill
the
sunken
tile
floor
was
icy
cold
to
the
feet
the
wind
swept
in
at
a
dozen
broken
places
in
the
corridor
side
of
the
wall
there
was
not
an
article
of
furniture
heavens
thought
felipe
as
he
entered
a
priest
of
our
church
take
rent
for
such
a
hole
as
this
there
was
no
light
in
the
place
except
the
little
which
came
from
the
fire
i
am
sorry
i
have
no
candle
senor
said
the
man
as
he
came
forward
my
wife
is
sick
and
we
are
very
no
matter
said
felipe
his
hand
already
at
his
purse
i
only
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
you
are
from
temecula
they
tell
yes
senor
the
man
replied
in
a
dogged
tone
no
man
of
temecula
could
yet
hear
the
word
without
a
pang
i
was
of
i
want
to
find
one
alessandro
assis
who
lived
there
you
knew
him
i
suppose
said
felipe
eagerly
at
this
moment
a
brand
broke
in
the
smouldering
fire
and
for
one
second
a
bright
blaze
shot
up
only
for
a
second
then
all
was
dark
again
but
the
swift
blaze
had
fallen
on
felipe
face
and
with
a
start
which
he
could
not
control
but
which
felipe
did
not
see
the
indian
had
recognized
him
ha
ha
he
thought
to
himself
senor
felipe
moreno
you
come
to
the
wrong
house
asking
for
news
of
alessandro
assis
it
was
antonio
antonio
who
had
been
at
the
moreno
antonio
who
knew
even
more
than
carmena
had
known
for
he
knew
what
a
marvel
and
miracle
it
seemed
that
the
beautiful
senorita
from
the
moreno
house
should
have
loved
alessandro
and
wedded
him
and
he
knew
that
on
the
night
she
went
away
with
him
alessandro
had
lured
out
of
the
corral
a
beautiful
horse
for
her
to
ride
alessandro
had
told
him
all
about
it
baba
fiery
splendid
baba
black
as
night
with
a
white
star
in
his
forehead
saints
but
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
do
to
steal
such
a
horse
as
that
with
a
star
for
a
mark
and
no
wonder
that
even
now
though
near
three
years
afterwards
senor
felipe
was
in
search
of
him
of
course
it
could
be
only
the
horse
he
wanted
ha
much
help
might
he
get
from
antonio
yes
senor
i
knew
him
he
replied
do
you
know
where
he
is
now
no
do
you
know
where
he
went
from
temecula
no
a
woman
told
me
he
went
to
monterey
i
have
been
there
looking
for
i
heard
too
he
had
gone
to
where
did
you
see
him
last
in
was
he
alone
yes
did
you
ever
hear
of
his
being
married
no
where
are
the
greater
part
of
the
temecula
people
now
like
this
senor
with
a
bitter
gesture
pointing
to
his
wife
most
of
us
are
beggars
a
few
here
a
few
there
some
have
gone
to
capitan
grande
some
way
down
into
lower
wearily
felipe
continued
his
bootless
questioning
no
suspicion
that
the
man
was
deceiving
him
crossed
his
mind
at
last
with
a
sigh
he
said
i
hoped
to
have
found
alessandro
by
your
means
i
am
greatly
disappointed
i
doubt
not
that
senor
felipe
moreno
thought
antonio
i
am
sorry
senor
he
said
it
smote
his
conscience
when
felipe
laid
in
his
hand
a
generous
and
said
here
is
a
bit
of
money
for
you
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
so
poorly
the
thanks
which
he
spoke
sounded
hesitating
and
gruff
so
remorseful
did
he
feel
senor
felipe
had
always
been
kind
to
them
how
well
they
had
fared
always
in
his
house
it
was
a
shame
to
lie
to
him
yet
the
first
duty
was
to
alessandro
it
could
not
be
avoided
and
thus
a
second
time
help
drifted
away
from
ramona
at
temecula
from
hartsel
felipe
got
the
first
true
intelligence
of
alessandro
movements
but
at
first
it
only
confirmed
his
worst
forebodings
alessandro
had
been
at
hartsel
house
he
had
been
alone
and
on
foot
he
was
going
to
walk
all
the
way
to
san
pasquale
where
he
had
the
promise
of
work
how
sure
the
kindly
woman
was
that
she
was
telling
the
exact
truth
after
long
ransacking
of
her
memory
and
comparing
of
events
she
fixed
the
time
so
nearly
to
the
true
date
that
it
was
to
felipe
mind
a
terrible
corroboration
of
his
fears
it
was
he
thought
about
a
week
after
ramona
flight
from
home
that
alessandro
had
appeared
thus
alone
on
foot
at
hartsel
in
great
destitution
she
said
and
she
had
lent
him
money
on
the
expectation
of
selling
his
violin
but
they
had
never
sold
it
there
it
was
yet
and
that
alessandro
was
dead
she
had
no
more
doubt
than
that
she
herself
was
alive
for
else
he
would
have
come
back
to
pay
her
what
he
owed
the
honestest
fellow
that
ever
lived
was
alessandro
did
not
the
senor
moreno
think
so
had
he
not
found
him
so
always
there
were
not
many
such
indians
as
alessandro
and
his
father
if
there
had
been
it
would
have
been
better
for
their
people
if
they
all
been
like
alessandro
i
tell
you
she
said
it
would
have
taken
more
than
any
san
diego
sheriff
to
have
put
them
out
of
their
homes
but
what
could
they
do
to
help
themselves
hartsel
asked
felipe
the
law
was
against
them
we
ca
any
of
us
go
against
that
i
myself
have
lost
half
my
estate
in
the
same
well
at
any
rate
they
would
have
gone
without
fighting
she
said
alessandro
had
been
here
they
all
felipe
asked
to
see
the
violin
but
that
is
not
alessandro
he
exclaimed
i
have
seen
no
she
said
did
i
say
it
was
his
it
was
his
father
one
of
the
indians
brought
it
in
here
to
hide
it
with
us
at
the
time
they
were
driven
out
it
is
very
old
they
say
and
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
if
you
could
find
the
right
man
to
buy
it
but
he
has
not
come
along
yet
he
will
though
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
but
that
we
get
our
money
back
on
it
if
alessandro
was
alive
he
have
been
here
long
before
finding
hartsel
thus
friendly
felipe
suddenly
decided
to
tell
her
the
whole
story
surprise
and
incredulity
almost
overpowered
her
at
first
she
sat
buried
in
thought
for
some
minutes
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
cried
if
he
got
that
girl
with
him
he
hiding
somewhere
there
nothing
like
an
indian
to
hide
and
if
he
is
hiding
every
other
indian
knows
it
and
you
just
waste
your
breath
asking
any
questions
of
any
of
them
they
will
die
before
they
will
tell
you
one
thing
they
are
as
secret
as
the
grave
and
they
every
one
of
them
worshipped
alessandro
you
see
they
thought
he
would
be
over
them
after
pablo
and
they
were
all
proud
of
him
because
he
could
read
and
write
and
knew
more
than
most
of
them
if
i
were
in
your
place
she
continued
i
would
not
give
it
up
yet
i
should
go
to
san
pasquale
now
it
might
just
be
that
she
was
along
with
him
that
night
he
stopped
here
hid
somewhere
while
he
came
in
to
get
the
money
i
know
i
urged
him
to
stay
all
night
and
he
said
he
could
not
do
it
i
do
know
though
where
he
could
possibly
have
left
her
while
he
came
never
in
all
her
life
had
hartsel
been
so
puzzled
and
so
astonished
as
now
but
her
sympathy
and
her
confident
belief
that
alessandro
might
yet
be
found
gave
unspeakable
cheer
to
felipe
if
i
find
them
i
shall
take
them
home
with
me
hartsel
he
said
as
he
rode
away
and
we
will
come
by
this
road
and
stop
to
see
and
the
very
speaking
of
the
words
cheered
him
all
the
way
to
san
pasquale
but
before
he
had
been
in
san
pasquale
an
hour
he
was
plunged
into
a
perplexity
and
disappointment
deeper
than
he
had
yet
felt
he
found
the
village
in
disorder
the
fields
neglected
many
houses
deserted
the
remainder
of
the
people
preparing
to
move
away
in
the
house
of
ysidro
alessandro
kinsman
was
living
a
white
family
the
family
of
a
man
who
had
the
greater
part
of
the
land
on
which
the
village
stood
ysidro
profiting
by
alessandro
example
when
he
found
that
there
was
no
help
that
the
american
had
his
papers
from
the
in
all
due
form
certifying
that
the
land
was
his
had
given
the
man
his
option
of
paying
for
the
house
or
having
it
burned
down
the
man
had
bought
the
house
and
it
was
only
the
week
before
felipe
arrived
that
ysidro
had
set
off
with
all
his
goods
and
chattels
for
mesa
grande
he
might
possibly
have
told
the
senor
more
the
people
said
than
any
one
now
in
the
village
could
but
even
ysidro
did
not
know
where
alessandro
intended
to
settle
he
told
no
one
he
went
to
the
north
that
was
all
they
knew
to
the
north
that
north
which
felipe
thought
he
had
thoroughly
searched
he
sighed
at
the
word
the
senor
could
if
he
liked
see
the
house
in
which
alessandro
had
lived
there
it
was
on
the
south
side
of
the
valley
just
in
the
edge
of
the
foothills
some
americans
lived
in
it
now
such
a
good
ranch
alessandro
had
the
best
wheat
in
the
valley
the
american
had
paid
alessandro
something
for
it
they
did
not
know
how
much
but
alessandro
was
very
lucky
to
get
anything
if
only
they
had
listened
to
him
he
was
always
telling
them
this
would
come
now
it
was
too
late
for
most
of
them
to
get
anything
for
their
farms
one
man
had
taken
the
whole
of
the
village
lands
and
he
had
bought
house
because
it
was
the
best
and
so
they
would
not
get
anything
they
were
utterly
disheartened
in
his
sympathy
for
them
felipe
almost
forgot
his
own
distresses
where
are
you
going
he
asked
of
several
who
knows
senor
was
their
reply
where
can
we
go
there
is
no
when
in
reply
to
his
questions
in
regard
to
alessandro
wife
felipe
heard
her
spoken
of
as
majella
his
perplexity
deepened
finally
he
asked
if
no
one
had
ever
heard
the
name
ramona
what
could
it
mean
could
it
be
possible
that
this
was
another
alessandro
than
the
one
of
whom
he
was
in
search
felipe
bethought
himself
of
a
possible
did
they
know
where
alessandro
had
married
this
wife
of
his
of
whom
every
word
they
spoke
seemed
both
like
and
unlike
ramona
yes
it
was
in
san
diego
they
had
been
married
by
father
gaspara
hoping
against
hope
the
baffled
felipe
rode
on
to
san
diego
and
here
as
would
have
it
he
found
not
father
gaspara
who
would
at
his
first
word
have
understood
all
but
a
young
irish
priest
who
had
only
just
come
to
be
father
gaspara
assistant
father
gaspara
was
away
in
the
mountains
at
santa
ysabel
but
the
young
assistant
would
do
equally
well
to
examine
the
records
he
was
courteous
and
kind
brought
out
the
tattered
old
book
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
his
breath
coming
fast
with
excitement
and
fear
there
felipe
read
in
father
gaspara
hasty
and
blotted
characters
the
fatal
entry
of
the
names
alessandro
assis
and
majella
fa
felipe
went
away
most
certainly
ramona
would
never
have
been
married
under
any
but
her
own
name
who
then
was
this
woman
whom
alessandro
assis
had
married
in
less
than
ten
days
from
the
night
on
which
ramona
had
left
her
home
some
indian
woman
for
whom
he
felt
compassion
or
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
previous
ties
and
where
in
what
lonely
forever
hidden
spot
was
the
grave
of
ramona
now
at
last
felipe
felt
sure
that
she
was
dead
it
was
useless
searching
farther
yet
after
he
reached
home
his
restless
conjectures
took
one
more
turn
and
he
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
every
priest
between
san
diego
and
monterey
asking
if
there
were
on
his
books
a
record
of
the
marriage
of
one
alessandro
assis
and
ramona
ortegna
it
was
not
impossible
that
there
might
be
after
all
another
alessandro
assis
the
old
fathers
in
baptizing
their
tens
of
thousands
of
indian
converts
were
sore
put
to
it
to
make
out
names
enough
there
might
have
been
another
assis
besides
old
pablo
and
of
alessandros
there
were
dozens
everywhere
this
last
faint
hope
also
failed
no
record
anywhere
of
an
alessandro
assis
except
in
father
gaspara
book
as
felipe
was
riding
out
of
san
pasquale
he
had
seen
an
indian
man
and
woman
walking
by
the
side
of
mules
heavily
laden
two
little
children
two
young
or
too
feeble
to
walk
were
so
packed
in
among
the
bundles
that
their
faces
were
the
only
part
of
them
in
sight
the
woman
was
crying
bitterly
more
of
these
exiles
god
help
the
poor
creatures
thought
felipe
and
he
pulled
out
his
purse
and
gave
the
woman
a
piece
of
gold
she
looked
up
in
as
great
astonishment
as
if
the
money
had
fallen
from
the
skies
thanks
thanks
senor
she
exclaimed
and
the
man
coming
up
to
felipe
said
also
god
reward
you
senor
that
is
more
money
than
i
had
in
the
world
does
the
senor
know
of
any
place
where
i
could
get
work
felipe
longed
to
say
yes
come
to
my
estate
there
you
shall
have
work
in
the
olden
time
he
would
have
done
it
without
a
second
thought
for
both
the
man
and
the
woman
had
good
faces
were
young
and
strong
but
the
of
the
moreno
estate
was
even
now
too
long
for
its
dwindled
fortunes
no
my
man
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
do
not
he
answered
i
live
a
long
way
from
here
where
were
you
thinking
of
going
somewhere
in
san
jacinto
said
the
man
they
say
the
americans
have
not
come
in
there
much
yet
i
have
a
brother
living
there
thanks
senor
may
the
saints
reward
you
san
jacinto
after
felipe
returned
home
the
name
haunted
his
thoughts
the
grand
bearing
that
name
he
had
known
well
in
many
a
distant
horizon
juan
can
he
said
one
day
are
there
many
indians
in
san
jacinto
the
mountain
said
juan
can
ay
i
suppose
the
mountain
said
felipe
what
else
is
there
the
valley
too
replied
juan
the
san
jacinto
valley
is
a
fine
broad
valley
though
the
river
is
not
much
to
be
counted
on
it
is
mostly
dry
sand
a
good
part
of
the
year
but
there
is
good
grazing
there
is
one
village
of
indians
i
know
in
the
valley
some
of
the
san
luis
rey
indians
came
from
there
and
up
on
the
mountain
is
a
big
village
the
wildest
indians
in
all
the
country
live
there
oh
they
are
fierce
senor
the
next
morning
felipe
set
out
for
san
jacinto
why
had
no
one
mentioned
why
had
he
not
himself
known
of
these
villages
perhaps
there
were
yet
others
he
had
not
heard
of
hope
sprang
in
impressionable
nature
as
easily
as
it
died
an
hour
a
moment
might
see
him
both
lifted
up
and
cast
down
when
he
rode
into
the
sleepy
little
village
street
of
san
bernardino
and
saw
in
the
near
horizon
against
the
southern
sky
a
superb
changing
in
the
sunset
lights
from
turquoise
to
ruby
and
from
ruby
to
turquoise
again
he
said
to
himself
she
is
there
i
have
found
her
the
sight
of
the
mountain
affected
him
as
it
had
always
affected
aunt
ri
with
an
indefinable
solemn
sense
of
something
revealed
yet
hidden
san
jacinto
he
said
to
a
bystander
pointing
to
it
with
his
whip
yes
senor
replied
the
man
as
he
spoke
a
pair
of
black
horses
came
whirling
round
the
corner
and
he
sprang
to
one
side
narrowly
escaping
being
knocked
down
that
tennessee
fellow
run
over
somebody
yet
with
those
black
devils
of
his
if
he
do
look
out
he
muttered
as
he
recovered
his
balance
felipe
glanced
at
the
horses
then
driving
his
spurs
deep
into
his
horse
sides
galloped
after
them
baba
by
god
he
cried
aloud
in
his
excitement
and
forgetful
of
everything
he
urged
his
horse
faster
shouting
as
he
rode
stop
that
man
stop
that
man
with
the
black
horses
jos
hearing
his
name
called
on
all
sides
reined
in
benito
and
baba
as
soon
as
he
could
and
looked
around
in
bewilderment
to
see
what
had
happened
before
he
had
time
to
ask
any
questions
felipe
had
overtaken
him
and
riding
straight
to
baba
head
had
flung
himself
from
his
own
horse
and
taken
baba
by
the
rein
crying
baba
baba
baba
knew
his
voice
and
began
to
whinny
and
plunge
felipe
was
nearly
unmanned
for
the
second
he
forgot
everything
a
crowd
was
gathering
around
them
it
had
never
been
quite
clear
to
the
san
bernardino
mind
that
jos
title
to
benito
and
baba
would
bear
looking
into
and
it
was
no
surprise
therefore
to
some
of
the
to
hear
felipe
cry
in
a
loud
voice
looking
suspiciously
at
jos
how
did
you
get
him
jos
was
a
wag
and
jos
was
never
hurried
the
man
did
not
live
nor
could
the
occasion
arrive
which
would
quicken
his
constitutional
drawl
before
even
beginning
his
answer
he
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
took
a
long
observant
look
at
felipe
then
in
a
pleasant
voice
he
said
wall
senor
i
allow
yer
air
a
senor
by
yer
color
it
would
take
right
smart

neither

it
and
chuckled
mebbe

holp
yer
tew

me
ef

mexican
he
said
and
proceeded
to
repeat
in
tolerably
good
spanish
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
he
had
just
said
adding
they
belong
to
an
indian
over
on
san
jacinto
at

the
off

his

he

but
hers
it
had
been
hers
ever
sence
she
was
a
girl
they
said
i
never
saw
people
think
so
much
of
hosses
as
they
before
jos
had
finished
speaking
felipe
had
bounded
into
the
wagon
throwing
his
horse
reins
to
a
boy
in
the
crowd
and
crying
follow
along
with
my
horse
will

must
speak
to

found
found
the
saints
be
praised
at

how

tell
this

how
should
he
thank
him

laying
his
hand
on
jos
knee
he
cried

with
excitement

street
i

all

can
tell
me
about
them
i

up
this

gentle
sweet
ramona
he
was
sure
i
take

straight
there
he
said
but
first
i
must
stop
at
tom
he
will
be
waiting
for
the
crowd
dispersed
disappointed
cheated
out
of
their
anticipated
scene
of
an
arrest
for
good
for
you
tennessee
and
fork
over
that
black
horse
jos
echoed
from
the
departing
groups
sensations
were
not
so
common
in
san
bernardino
that
they
could
afford
to
slight
so
notable
an
occasion
as
this
as
jos
turned
the
corner
into
the
street
where
he
lived
he
saw
his
mother
coming
at
a
rapid
run
towards
them
her
half
off
her
head
her
spectacles
pushed
up
in
her
hair
why

mammy
he
exclaimed
what
ever
hez
gone
wrong
naow
before
he
finished
speaking
she
saw
the
black
horses

snatching
her
bonnet
from

head
waved
it
wildly
crying
yeow
jos
jos

breathlessly
she
continued
talking
her
words
half
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
wheels
apparently
she
did
not
see
the
stranger
sitting
by
side
oh

he
turned
in
despair
to

he
said
i

jos
gradually
drew
out
the
whole
story
from
his
mother
excited
and
incoherent
speech
and
translated
it
felipe
groaned
aloud
too
late
too

he

felt
as

that
ramona
never

the
shock
of

suddenly
looking

more

thus
familiarly
spoken
spoken
by
persons
who
had
known
him
so
recently
and
who
were
grieving
grieving
as
friends
to
hear
of
his
terrible
death
felipe
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
trance
rousing
himself
he
said

felipe
was
thankful
indeed
for

and
expressed
himself
in
phrases
so
warm
that
she
was
embarrassed

hindered
er
holpin
ramony
this
time
i
ai
a
mite
felipe
could
not
have
found
a
better
ally
the
comparative
silence
enforced
between
them
by
reason
of
lack
of
a
common
vehicle
for
their
thoughts
was
on
the
whole
less
of
a
disadvantage
than
would
have
at
first
appeared
they
understood
each
other
well
enough
for
practical
purposes
and
their
unity
in
aim
and
in
affection
for
ramona
made
a
bond
so
strong
it
could
not
have
been
enhanced
by
words
it
was
past
sundown
when
they
left
san
bernardino
but
a
full
moon
made
the
night
as
good
as
day
for
their
journey
when
it
first
shone
out
aunt
ri
pointing
to
it
said
curtly
thet
yes
replied
felipe
who
did
not
know
either
of
the
words
she
had
spoken
it
is
good
it
shows
to
us
the
thar
naow
say
he
ca
understand
english
thought
aunt
ri
benito
and
baba
travelled
as
if
they
knew
the
errand
on
which
they
were
hurrying
good
forty
miles
they
had
gone
without
flagging
once
when
aunt
ri
pointing
to
a
house
on
the
right
hand
of
the
road
the
only
one
they
had
seen
for
many
miles
said
we

i
do
believe
he
understood
a
word
i

naow
thought
aunt
ri
to
herself
suddenly
becoming
aware
of
the
hopeless
bewilderment
on
felipe
face
much
use
sayin
anything
plain
yes
no
between
folks
thet
ca
understand
each
other
langwedge
s
fur
thet
goes
i
allow
thar
ai
any
gret
the
biggest
part
o
what
sed
between
folks
thet
doos
when
the
merrill
family
learned
felipe
purpose
of
going
up
the
mountain
to
the
cahuilla
village
they
attempted
to
dissuade
him
from
taking
his
own
horses
he
would
kill
them
both
horses
like
those
they
said
if
he
took
them
over
that
road
it
was
a
cruel
road
they
pointed
out
to
him
the
line
where
it
wound
doubling
and
tacking
on
the
sides
of
precipices
like
a
path
for
a
goat
or
chamois
aunt
ri
shuddered
at
the
sight
but
said
nothing
i
gwine
whar
he
goes
she
said
grimly
to
herself
i
ai
a
gwine
ter
back
daown
naow
but
i
dew
jest
wish
jeff
hyer
wuz
felipe
himself
disliked
what
he
saw
and
heard
of
the
grade
the
road
had
been
built
for
bringing
down
lumber
and
for
six
miles
it
was
at
perilous
angles
after
this
it
wound
along
on
ridges
and
in
ravines
till
it
reached
the
heart
of
a
great
pine
forest
where
stood
a
passing
this
it
plunged
into
still
darker
denser
woods
some
fifteen
miles
farther
on
and
then
came
out
among
vast
opens
meadows
and
grassy
still
on
the
majestic
mountain
northern
or
eastern
slopes
from
these
another
steep
road
little
more
than
a
trail
led
south
and
up
to
the
cahuilla
village
a
day
and
a
half
hard
journey
at
the
shortest
it
was
from
merrill
and
no
one
unfamiliar
with
the
country
could
find
the
last
part
of
the
way
without
a
guide
finally
it
was
arranged
that
one
of
the
younger
merrills
should
go
in
this
capacity
and
should
also
take
two
of
his
strongest
horses
accustomed
to
the
road
by
the
help
of
these
the
terrible
ascent
was
made
without
difficulty
though
baba
at
first
snorted
plunged
and
resented
the
humiliation
of
being
harnessed
with
his
head
at
another
horse
tail
except
for
their
sad
errand
both
felipe
and
aunt
ri
would
have
experienced
a
keen
delight
in
this
ascent
with
each
fresh
lift
on
the
precipitous
terraces
the
view
off
to
the
south
and
west
broadened
until
the
whole
san
jacinto
valley
lay
unrolled
at
their
feet
the
pines
were
grand
standing
they
seemed
shapely
columns
fallen
the
upper
curve
of
their
huge
yellow
disks
came
above
a
man
head
so
massive
was
their
size
on
many
of
them
the
bark
had
been
riddled
from
root
to
top
as
by
myriads
of
in
each
hole
had
been
cunningly
stored
away
an
acorn
the
woodpeckers
granaries
look
at
thet
naow
exclaimed
the
observant
aunt
ri
an
folk
thet
sez
dumb
critters
ai
got
brains
they
ai
noways
dumb
to
each
other
i
notice
an
we

dumb
aourselves
when
we
air
ketched
with
furriners
i
allow
i
next
door
to
dumb
myself
with
this
hyar
mexican
i
er
travellin
that
so
replied
sam
merrill
when
we
fust
got
here
i
thought
ha
gone
clean
out
o
my
head
tryin
to
make
these
mexicans
sense
my
meanin
my
tongue
was
plaguy
little
use
to
me
but
now
i
can
talk
their
lingo
but
pa
he
ca
talk
to
nohow
he
hai
learned
the
fust
word
he
ben
here
goin
on
two
years
we
the
miles
seemed
leagues
to
felipe
aunt
ri
drawling
tones
as
she
chatted
volubly
with
young
merrill
chafed
him
how
could
she
chatter
but
when
he
thought
this
it
would
chance
that
in
a
few
moments
more
he
would
see
her
clandestinely
wiping
away
tears
and
his
heart
would
warm
to
her
again
they
slept
at
a
miserable
cabin
in
one
of
the
clearings
and
at
early
dawn
pushed
on
reaching
the
cahuilla
village
before
noon
as
their
carriage
came
in
sight
a
great
running
to
and
fro
of
people
was
to
be
seen
such
an
event
as
the
arrival
of
a
comfortable
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
had
never
before
taken
place
in
the
village
the
agitation
into
which
the
people
had
been
thrown
by
the
murder
of
alessandro
had
by
no
means
subsided
they
were
all
on
the
alert
suspicious
of
each
new
occurrence
the
news
had
only
just
reached
the
village
that
farrar
had
been
set
at
liberty
and
would
not
be
punished
for
his
crime
and
the
flames
of
indignation
and
desire
for
vengeance
which
the
aged
capitan
had
so
much
difficulty
in
allaying
in
the
outset
were
bursting
forth
again
this
morning
it
was
therefore
a
crowd
of
hostile
and
lowering
faces
which
gathered
around
the
carriage
as
it
stopped
in
front
of
the
capitan
house
aunt
ri
face
was
a
ludicrous
study
of
mingled
terror
defiance
and
contempt
uv
all
ther
beggarly
trash
ever
i
laid
eyes
on
she

tone

now
about
the
killin
o

what

the
only

to
protect
ourselves
but
it
was
a
mean
trick
to
blow
the
feller
face
to
pieces
after
he
was
dead
but
jim
a
rough
feller
i
expect
he
was
so
mad
when
he

his
horse
that
he
did
know
what
he
aunt
ri
was
half
paralyzed
with
astonishment
at
this
speech
felipe
had
leaped
out
of
the
carriage
and
after
a
few
words
with
the
old
capitan
had
hurried
with
him
into
his
house
felipe
had
evidently
forgotten
that
she
was
still
in
the
carriage
his
going
into
the
house
looked
as
if
ramona
was
there
aunt
ri
in
all
her
indignation
and
astonishment
was
conscious
of
this
train
of
thought
running
through
her
mind
but
not
even
the
near
prospect
of
seeing
ramona
could
bridle
her
tongue
now
or
make
her
defer
replying
to
the
extraordinary
statements
she
had
just
heard
the
words
seemed
to
choke
her
as
she
began
young
man
she
said

aunt
ri
would
have
said
to
the
astounded
merrill
was
never
known
for
at
that
instant
the
old
capitan
returning
to
the
door
beckoned
to
her
and
springing
from
her
seat
to
the
ground
sternly
rejecting
sam
offered
hand
she
hastily
entered
the
house
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
felipe
turned
an
anguished
face
toward
her
and
said
come
speak
to
he
was
on
his
knees
by
a
wretched
pallet
on
the
floor
was
that
ramona
that
prostrate
form
hair
dishevelled
eyes
glittering
cheeks
scarlet
hands
playing
meaninglessly
like
the
hands
of
one
crazed
with
a
rosary
of
gold
beads
yes
it
was
ramona
and
it
was
like
this
she
had
lain
there
now
ten
days
and
the
people
had
exhausted
all
their
simple
skill
for
her
in
vain
aunt
ri
burst
into
tears
oh

said

dew

i
seed
some
on
growin
not
er
mile
and
without
a
second
look
or
another
word
she
ran
out
of
the
door
and
springing
into
the
carriage
said
speaking
faster
than
she
had
been
heard
to
speak
for
thirty
years
yeow

cried
leaning
out
eagerly
scrutinizing
each
inch
of
the
barren
ground
stop
here
she
cried
i
knowed
i
smelt
the
bitter
on
somewhars
along
hyar
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
she
had
a
mass
of
the
soft
shining
gray
feathery
leaves
in
her
hands
and
was
urging
the
horses
fiercely
on
their
way
back
this
cure
her
ef
ennything
will
she
said
as
she
entered
the
room
again
but
her
heart
sank
as
she
saw
ramona
eyes
roving
restlessly
over
felipe
face
no
sign
of
recognition
in
them
she
bad
she
said
her
lips
trembling
but
say
die
ez
allers
our
motto
never
tew
late
fur
ennything
but
oncet
yer
ca
tell
when
thet
time
come
till
it
past
steaming
bowls
of
the
bitterly
odorous
infusion
she
held
at
nostrils
with
infinite
patience
she
forced
drop
after
drop
of
it
between
the
unconscious
lips
she
bathed
the
hands
and
head
her
own
hands
blistered
by
the
heat
it
was
a
fight
with
death
but
love
and
life
won
before
night
ramona
was
asleep
felipe
and
aunt
ri
sat
by
her
strange
but
not
uncongenial
watchers
each
taking
heart
from
the
other
devotion
all
night
long
ramona
slept
as
felipe
watched
her
he
remembered
his
own
fever
and
how
she
had
knelt
by
his
bed
and
prayed
there
he
glanced
around
the
room
in
a
niche
in
the
mud
wall
was
a
cheap
print
of
the
madonna
one
candle
just
smouldering
out
before
it
the
village
people
had
drawn
heavily
on
their
stores
keeping
candles
burning
for
alessandro
and
ramona
during
the
past
ten
days
the
rosary
had
slipped
from
hold
taking
it
cautiously
in
his
hand
felipe
went
to
the
picture
and
falling
on
his
knees
began
to
pray
as
simply
as
if
he
were
alone
the
indians
standing
on
the
doorway
also
fell
on
their
knees
and
a
murmur
was
heard
for
a
moment
aunt
ri
looked
at
the
kneeling
figures
with
contempt
oh
lawd
she
thought
the
pore
heathen
prayin
ter
a
picter
then
a
sudden
revulsion
seized
her
i
allow
i
ai
gwine
ter
be
the
unly
one
out
er
the
hull
number
thet
do
seem

jine

prayer
tew
but
i
sha
say
mine
ter
no
picter
and
aunt
ri
fell
on
her
knees
and
when
a
young
indian
woman
by
her
side
slipped
a
rosary
into
her
hand
aunt
ri
did
not
repulse
it
but
hid
it
in
the
folds
of
her
gown
till
the
prayers
were
done
it
was
a
moment
and
a
lesson
aunt
ri
never
forgot
xxvi
the
capitan
house
faced
the
east
just
as
day
broke
and
the
light
streamed
in
at
the
open
door
ramona
eyes
unclosed
felipe
and
aunt
ri
were
both
by
her
side
with
a
look
of
bewildered
terror
she
gazed
at
them
thar
thar
naow
yer
jest
shet
yer
eyes
go
right
off
ter
sleep
agin
honey
said
aunt
ri
composedly
laying
her
hand
on
eyelids
and
compelling
them
down
we
air
hyar
feeleepy
me
we
air
goin
ter
stay
i
allow
yer
need
be
afeerd
o
nothin
go
ter
sleep
the
eyelids
quivered
beneath
aunt
ri
fingers
tears
forced
their
way
and
rolled
slowly
down
the
cheeks
the
lips
trembled
the
voice
strove
to
speak
but
it
was
only
like
the
ghost
of
a
whisper
the
faint
question
that
came
felipe
yes
dear
i
am
here
too
breathed
felipe
go
to
sleep
we
will
not
leave
you
and
again
ramona
sank
away
into
the
merciful
sleep
which
was
saving
her
life
ther
longer
she
kin
sleep
ther
better
said
aunt
ri
with
a
sigh
like
a
groan
i
allow
i
dread
ter
see
her
reely
come
to
be
the
fust
she
hev
ter
live
it
all
over
again
but
aunt
ri
did
not
know
what
forces
of
fortitude
had
been
gathering
in
ramona
soul
during
these
last
bitter
years
out
of
her
gentle
constancy
had
been
woven
the
heroic
fibre
of
which
martyrs
are
made
this
and
her
inextinguishable
faith
had
made
her
strong
as
were
those
of
old
who
had
trial
of
cruel
mocking
wandering
about
being
destitute
afflicted
tormented
wandered
in
deserts
and
in
mountains
and
in
dens
and
caves
of
the
when
she
waked
the
second
time
it
was
with
a
calm
almost
beatific
smile
that
she
gazed
on
felipe
and
whispered
how
did
you
find
me
dear
felipe
it
was
rather
by
the
motions
of
her
lips
than
by
any
sound
that
he
knew
the
words
she
had
not
yet
strength
enough
to
make
an
audible
sound
when
they
laid
her
baby
on
her
breast
she
smiled
again
and
tried
to
embrace
her
but
was
too
weak
pointing
to
the
baby
eyes
she
whispered
gazing
earnestly
at
felipe
a
convulsion
passed
over
her
face
as
she
spoke
the
word
and
the
tears
flowed
felipe
could
not
speak
he
glanced
helplessly
at
aunt
ri
who
promptly
responded
naow
honey
do
yeow
talk
good
fur
ye
feeleepy
me
we
air
in
a
powerful
hurry
ter
git
yer
strong
well
tote
ye
out
er
this
aunt
ri
stopped
no
substantive
in
her
vocabulary
answered
her
need
at
that
moment
i
allow
ye

go
a
week
ef

ef

jest
shet
up
honey
we
look
arter
feebly
ramona
turned
her
grateful
inquiring
eyes
on
felipe
her
lips
framed
the
words
with
you
yes
dear
home
with
me
said
felipe
clasping
her
hand
in
his
i
have
been
searching
for
you
all
this
an
anxious
look
came
into
the
sweet
face
felipe
knew
what
it
meant
how
often
he
had
seen
it
in
the
olden
time
he
feared
to
shock
her
by
the
sudden
mention
of
the
senora
death
yet
that
would
harm
her
less
than
continued
anxiety
i
am
alone
dear
ramona
he
whispered
there
is
no
one
now
but
you
my
sister
to
take
care
of
me
my
mother
has
been
dead
a
the
eyes
dilated
then
filled
with
sympathetic
tears
dear
felipe
she
sighed
but
her
heart
took
courage
felipe
phrase
was
like
one
inspired
another
duty
another
work
another
loyalty
waiting
for
ramona
not
only
her
child
to
live
for
but
to
take
care
of
felipe
ramona
would
not
die
youth
a
mother
love
a
sister
affection
and
duty
on
the
side
of
life
the
battle
was
won
and
won
quickly
too
to
the
simple
cahuillas
it
seemed
like
a
miracle
and
they
looked
on
aunt
ri
face
with
something
akin
to
a
superstitious
reverence
they
themselves
were
not
ignorant
of
the
value
of
the
herb
by
means
of
which
she
had
wrought
the
marvellous
cure
but
they
had
made
repeated
experiments
with
it
upon
ramona
without
success
it
must
be
that
there
had
been
some
potent
spell
in
aunt
ri
handling
they
would
hardly
believe
her
when
in
answer
to
their
persistent
questioning
she
reiterated
the
assertion
that
she
had
used
nothing
except
the
hot
water
and
old
man
which
was
her
name
for
the
wild
wormwood
and
which
when
explained
to
them
impressed
them
greatly
as
having
no
doubt
some
significance
in
connection
with
the
results
of
her
preparation
of
the
leaves
rumors
about
felipe
ran
swiftly
throughout
the
region
the
presence
in
the
cahuilla
village
of
a
rich
mexican
gentleman
who
spent
gold
like
water
and
kept
mounted
men
riding
day
and
night
after
everything
anything
he
wanted
for
his
sick
sister
was
an
event
which
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
lonely
country
loomed
into
colossal
proportions
he
had
travelled
all
over
california
with
four
horses
in
search
of
her
he
was
only
waiting
till
she
was
well
to
take
her
to
his
home
in
the
south
and
then
he
was
going
to
arrest
the
man
who
had
murdered
her
husband
and
have
him
hanged
yes
hanged
small
doubt
about
that
or
if
the
law
cleared
him
there
was
still
the
bullet
this
rich
senor
would
see
him
shot
if
rope
were
not
to
be
had
jim
farrar
heard
these
tales
and
quaked
in
his
guilty
soul
the
rope
he
had
small
fear
of
for
well
he
knew
the
temper
of
san
diego
county
juries
and
judges
but
the
bullet
that
was
another
thing
and
these
mexicans
were
like
indians
in
their
vengeance
time
did
not
tire
them
and
their
memories
were
long
farrar
cursed
the
day
he
had
let
his
temper
get
the
better
of
him
on
that
lonely
mountainside
how
much
the
better
nobody
but
he
himself
knew
nobody
but
he
and
ramona
and
even
ramona
did
not
know
the
bitter
whole
she
knew
that
alessandro
had
no
knife
and
had
gone
forward
with
no
hostile
intent
but
she
knew
nothing
beyond
that
only
the
murderer
himself
knew
that
the
dialogue
which
he
had
reported
to
the
judge
and
jury
to
justify
his
act
was
an
entire
fabrication
of
his
own
and
that
instead
of
it
had
been
spoken
but
four
words
by
alessandro
and
those
were
senor
i
will
explain
and
that
even
after
the
first
shot
had
pierced
his
lungs
and
the
blood
was
choking
in
his
throat
he
had
still
run
a
step
or
two
farther
with
his
hand
uplifted
deprecatingly
and
made
one
more
effort
to
speak
before
he
fell
to
the
ground
dead
callous
as
farrar
was
and
clear
as
it
was
in
his
mind
that
killing
an
indian
was
no
harm
he
had
not
liked
to
recall
the
pleading
anguish
in
alessandro
tone
and
in
his
face
as
he
fell
he
had
not
liked
to
recall
this
even
before
he
heard
of
this
rich
mexican
who
had
appeared
on
the
scene
and
now
he
found
the
memories
still
more
unpleasant
fear
is
a
wonderful
goad
to
remorse
there
was
another
thing
too
which
to
his
great
wonder
had
been
apparently
overlooked
by
everybody
at
least
nothing
had
been
said
about
it
but
the
bearing
of
it
on
his
case
if
the
case
were
brought
up
a
second
time
and
minutely
investigated
would
be
most
unfortunate
and
this
was
that
the
only
clew
he
had
to
the
fact
of
alessandro
having
taken
his
horse
was
that
the
poor
fellow
had
left
his
own
gray
pony
in
the
corral
in
place
of
the
horse
he
took
a
strange
thing
surely
for
a
to
do
cold
sweat
burst
out
on
farrar
forehead
more
than
once
as
he
realized
how
this
coupled
with
the
fact
of
alessandro
liability
to
attacks
of
insanity
might
be
made
to
tell
against
him
if
he
should
be
brought
to
trial
for
the
murder
he
was
as
cowardly
as
he
was
cruel
never
yet
were
the
two
traits
separate
in
human
nature
and
after
a
few
days
of
this
torturing
suspense
and
apprehension
he
suddenly
resolved
to
leave
the
country
if
not
forever
at
least
for
a
few
years
till
this
should
be
out
of
the
way
he
lost
no
time
in
carrying
out
his
resolution
and
it
was
well
he
did
not
for
it
was
only
three
days
after
he
had
disappeared
that
felipe
walked
into
judge
wells
office
one
morning
to
make
inquiries
relative
to
the
preliminary
hearing
which
had
been
held
there
in
the
matter
of
the
murder
of
the
indian
alessandro
assis
by
james
farrar
and
when
the
judge
taking
down
his
books
read
to
felipe
his
notes
of
the
case
and
went
on
to
say
if
farrar
testimony
is
true
ramona
the
wife
must
be
false
and
at
any
rate
her
testimony
would
not
be
worth
a
straw
with
any
jury
felipe
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
she
of
whom
you
speak
is
my
and
by
god
senor
if
i
can
find
that
man
i
will
shoot
him
as
i
would
a
dog
and
i
see
then
if
a
san
diego
county
jury
will
hang
me
for
ridding
the
country
of
such
a
brute
and
felipe
would
have
been
as
good
as
his
word
it
was
a
wise
thing
farrar
had
done
in
making
his
escape
when
aunt
ri
heard
that
farrar
had
fled
the
country
she
pushed
up
her
spectacles
and
looked
reflectively
at
her
informant
it
was
young
merrill
fled

everywhar

er

thet
all
wuz

those
thet

ghost
thet
be
the
way
be
with
this
farrar
he
live
ter
wish
he
let
hisself
be
hanged
er
shot
er
erry
which
way
ter
git
out
er
his
young
merrill
listened
with
unwonted
gravity
to
aunt
ri
earnest
words
they
reached
a
depth
in
his
nature
which
had
been
long
untouched
a
stratum
so
to
speak
which
lay
far
beneath
the
surface
the
character
of
the
western
frontiersman
is
often
a
singular
accumulation
of
such
strata
the
training
and
beliefs
of
his
earliest
days
overlain
by
successions
of
unrelated
and
violent
experiences
like
geological
deposits
underneath
the
exterior
crust
of
the
most
hardened
and
ruffianly
nature
often
remains
its
forms
not
yet
quite
fossilized
a
realm
full
of
the
devout
customs
doctrines
religious
influences
which
the
boy
knew
and
the
man
remembers
by
sudden
upheaval
in
some
great
catastrophe
or
struggle
in
his
mature
life
these
all
come
again
into
the
light
assembly
catechism
definitions
which
he
learned
in
his
childhood
and
has
not
thought
of
since
ring
in
his
ears
and
he
is
thrown
into
all
manner
of
confusions
and
inconsistencies
of
feeling
and
speech
by
this
clashing
of
the
old
and
new
man
within
him
it
was
much
in
this
way
that
aunt
ri
words
smote
upon
young
merrill
he
was
not
many
years
removed
from
the
sound
of
a
preaching
of
the
straitest
new
england
calvinism
the
wild
frontier
life
had
drawn
him
in
and
under
as
in
a
whirlpool
but
he
was
new
englander
yet
at
heart
that
so
aunt
ri
he
exclaimed
that
so
i
do
a
man
that
committed
murder
ever
have
any
peace
in
this
world
nor
in
the
next
nuther
without
he
repents
but
ye
see
this
business
is
different
murder
to
kill
a
any
way
you
can
fix
it
everybody
admits
that
a
feller
that
caught
had
ought
to
be
shot
and
he
will
be
too
i
tell
you
in
this
country
a
look
of
impatient
despair
spread
over
aunt
ri
face
i
hai
no
patience
left
with
yer
she
said
er
talkin
abaout
stealin
hosses
ez
ef
hosses
wuz
human
bein
but
lettin
thet
all
go
this
injun
he
wuz
crazy
yer
all
knowed
it
thet
farrar
knowed
it
think
ef
he
ben
stealin
the
hoss
he
er
left
his
own
hoss
in
the
corral
same
ez
yer
might
say
leavin
his
kyerd
to
say
wuz
he
done
it
the
hoss
er
tied
in
plain
sight
front
uv
his
house
fur
ennybody
ter
see
left
his
own
horse
so
he
did
retorted
merrill
a
poor
miserable
old
pony
that
worth
twenty
dollars
jim
horse
was
worth
two
hundred
cheap
at
thet
ai
nuther
here
nor
thar
in
what
we
air
sayin
persisted
aunt
ri
i
ai
a
speakin
on
ez
a
swap
er
hosses
what
i
say
is
he
tryin
to
cover
up
thet
he
tuk
the
hoss
we
air
sum
used
ter
in
tennessee
but
i
never
heered
o
one
yit
thet
left
his
name
fur
a
refference
berhind
him
ter
show
which
road
he
tuk
fastened
ther
stolen
critter
ter
his
front
gate
when
he
got
hum
i
allow
me
yeow
hed
better
say
anythin
much
more
on
ther
subjeck
fur
i
allow
we
air
bound
to
querril
ef
we
dew
and
nothing
that
merrill
said
could
draw
another
word
out
of
aunt
ri
in
regard
to
alessandro
death
but
there
was
another
subject
on
which
she
was
tireless
and
her
speech
eloquent
it
was
the
kindness
and
goodness
of
the
cahuilla
people
the
last
vestige
of
her
prejudice
against
indians
had
melted
and
gone
in
the
presence
of
their
friendliness
i
never
hear
a
word
said
agin
never
ter
my
longest
day
she
said
the
way
the
pore
things
hed
jest
stripped
theirselves
to
git
things
fur
ramony
beat
all
ever
i
see
among
white
folks
i
ben
raound
most
they
lookin
fur
no
pay
nuther
fur
they
did
know
till
feeleepy
me
cum
thet
she
had
any
folks
ennywhar
they
taken
care
on
her
till
she
died
jest
the
same
the
sick
allers
ez
took
care
on
among
them
they
sed
long
uz
enny
on
em
hez
got
a
thing
left
thet
ther
way
they
air
raised
i
allow
white
folks
might
take
a
lesson
on
in
thet
in
heaps
uv
other
things
tew
oh
i
done
talkin
again
injuns
naow
do
yeow
furgit
it
but
i
know
fur
all
thet
wo
make
any
difference
like
there
cudd
nobody
ennythin
this
world
seein
theirselves
i
wuz
thet
way
tew
i
allow
i
hai
got
no
call
ter
talk
but
i
jest
wish
the
hull
world
could
see
what
i
seen
thet
all
it
was
a
sad
day
in
the
village
when
ramona
and
her
friends
departed
heartily
as
the
kindly
people
rejoiced
in
her
having
found
such
a
protector
for
herself
and
her
child
and
deeply
as
they
felt
and
aunt
ri
and
gratitude
towards
them
they
were
yet
conscious
of
a
loss
of
a
void
the
gulf
between
them
and
the
rest
of
the
world
seemed
defined
anew
their
sense
of
isolation
deepened
their
hopeless
poverty
emphasized
ramona
wife
of
alessandro
had
been
as
their
sister
one
of
them
as
such
she
would
have
had
share
in
all
their
life
had
to
offer
but
its
utmost
was
nothing
was
but
hardship
and
deprivation
and
she
was
being
borne
away
from
it
like
one
rescued
not
so
much
from
death
as
from
a
life
worse
than
death
the
tears
streamed
down
ramona
face
as
she
bade
them
farewell
she
embraced
again
and
again
the
young
mother
who
had
for
so
many
days
suckled
her
child
even
it
was
said
depriving
her
own
hardier
babe
that
ramona
should
not
suffer
sister
you
have
given
me
my
child
she
cried
i
can
never
thank
you
i
will
pray
for
you
all
my
she
made
no
inquiries
as
to
felipe
plans
unquestioningly
like
a
little
child
she
resigned
herself
into
his
hands
a
power
greater
than
hers
was
ordering
her
way
felipe
was
its
instrument
no
other
voice
spoke
to
guide
her
the
same
old
simplicity
of
acceptance
which
had
characterized
her
daily
life
in
her
girlhood
and
kept
her
serene
and
sunny
then
serene
under
trials
sunny
in
her
routine
of
little
duties
had
kept
her
serene
through
all
the
afflictions
and
calm
if
not
sunny
under
all
the
burdens
of
her
later
life
and
it
did
not
desert
her
even
now
aunt
ri
gazed
at
her
with
a
sentiment
as
near
to
veneration
as
her
dry
humorous
practical
nature
was
capable
of
feeling
i
allow
i
donno
but
i
sh
cum
ter
believin
in
saints
tew
she
said
ef
i
wuz
ter
live
side
er
thet
gal
like
she
wuz
suthin
more
human
beats
me
plum
out
ther
way
she
takes
her
troubles
thar
sum
would
say
she
hed
no
feelin
but
i
allow
she
hez
more
most
folks
i
kin
see
thet
i
allow
i
did
never
expect
ter
think
well
uv
prayin
to
picters
strings
er
beads
sech
but
ef
thet
keeps
her
up
ther
way
she
kept
up
i
allow
thar
more
in
it
it
hed
credit
fur
i
ai
gwine
ter
say
enny
more
agin
it
nor
agin
injuns
like
i
gittin
heaps
er
new
idears
inter
my
head
these
days
i
turn
injun
mebbe
afore
i
git
through
the
farewell
to
aunt
ri
was
hardest
of
all
ramona
clung
to
her
as
to
a
mother
at
times
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
stay
by
her
side
than
go
home
with
felipe
then
she
reproached
herself
for
the
thought
as
for
a
treason
and
ingratitude
felipe
saw
the
feeling
and
did
not
wonder
at
it
dear
girl
he
thought
it
is
the
nearest
she
has
ever
come
to
knowing
what
a
mother
love
is
like
and
he
lingered
in
san
bernardino
week
after
week
on
the
pretence
that
ramona
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
bear
the
journey
home
when
in
reality
his
sole
motive
for
staying
was
his
reluctance
to
deprive
her
of
aunt
ri
wholesome
and
cheering
companionship
aunt
ri
was
busily
at
work
on
a
rag
carpet
for
the
indian
agent
wife
she
had
just
begun
it
had
woven
only
a
few
inches
on
that
dreadful
morning
when
the
news
of
alessandro
death
reached
her
it
was
of
her
favorite
pattern
the
pattern
as
she
called
it
no
set
stripes
or
regular
alternation
of
colors
but
ball
after
ball
of
the
indiscriminately
mixed
tints
woven
back
and
forth
on
a
warp
of
a
single
color
the
constant
variety
in
it
the
unexpectedly
harmonious
blending
of
the
colors
gave
her
delight
and
afforded
her
a
subject
too
of
not
unphilosophical
reflection
wall
she
said
it
called
ther
pattren
but
is
thar
ai
enny
accountin
fur
ther
way
ther
breadths
come
sometimes
like
wuz
kind
er
magic
when
they
air
sewed

ther
way
it
gwine
ter

with
heaps
er
things
in
this
life

a
kind
er
pattren

but
fur
me
i
take
ther
pattren
every
time
sir
straight
when
the
carpet
was
done
aunt
ri
took
the
roll
in
her
own
independent
arms
and
strode
with
it
to
the
agent
house
she
had
been
biding
the
time
when
she
should
have
this
excuse
for
going
there
her
mind
was
burdened
with
questions
she
wished
to
ask
information
she
wished
to
give
and
she
chose
an
hour
when
she
knew
she
would
find
the
agent
himself
at
home
i
allow
yer
heered
why
i
wuz
behind
time
with
this
yere
carpet
she
said
i
wuz
up
ter
san
jacinto
mounting
where
thet
injun
wuz
murdered
we
brung
his
widder
ther
baby
daown
with
us
me
her
brother
he
tuk
her
home
ter
his
house
ter
live
he
reel
well
yes
the
agent
had
heard
this
he
had
wondered
why
the
widow
did
not
come
to
see
him
he
had
expected
to
hear
from
her
wall
i
did
hent
ter
her
thet
yer
could
dew
something
ef
she
wuz
ter
tell
yer
all
abaout
it
but
she
allowed
thar
enny
use
in

jedge
he
sed
her

nuthin
to
no

thet
wuz
what
i
wuz
a
wantin
to
ask
yeow
ef
thet
wuz
yes
that
is
what
the
lawyers
here
told
me
said
the
agent
i
was
going
to
have
the
man
arrested
but
they
said
it
would
be
folly
to
bring
the
case
to
trial
the
woman
testimony
would
not
be
yeow
got
power
ter
git
a
man
punished
fur
sellin
whiskey
to
injuns
i
notice

them
wuz
thar
words
thet

ter
that
so
said
the
agent
so
i
am
i
am
determined
to
break
up
this
vile
business
of
selling
whiskey
to
indians
it
is
no
use
trying
to
do
anything
for
them
while
they
are
made
drunk
in
this
way
it
a
sin
and
a
thet
so
i
allow
ter
yeow
said
aunt
ri
thar
ai
any
thet
but
ef
yeow
got
power
ter
git
a
man
put
in

got
power
to
git
him
punished
ef
he
goes
kills
thet
injun
sems
ter
me
thar
suthin
abaout
that
is
just
the
trouble
in
my
position
here
aunt
ri
he
said
i
have
no
real
power
over
my
indians
as
i
ought
to
what
makes
yer
call
yeour
injuns
broke
in
aunt
ri
the
agent
colored
aunt
ri
was
a
privileged
character
but
her
logical
method
of
questioning
was
inconvenient
i
only
mean
that
they
are
under
my
charge
he
said
i
do
mean

she
did

so
concluded
her

very
differently
from
her

i

you

she
looked
honestly
puzzled
look
there
aunt
ri
said
he
triumphantly
pointing
to
a
pile
of
books
and
papers
all
those
to
be
gone
through
with
and
a
report
to
be
made
out

a

i

and
for

i

then
retorted
aunt
ri
satirical
ef
yeow
air
plum
tired
doin
thet
and
she
took
her
leave
not
a
whit
clearer
in
her
mind
as
to
the
real
nature
and
function
of
the
indian
agency
than
she
was
in
the
beginning
through
all
of
ramona
journey
home
she
seemed
to
herself
to
be
in
a
dream
her
baby
in
her
arms
the
faithful
creatures
baba
and
benito
gayly
trotting
along
at
a
pace
so
swift
that
the
carriage
seemed
gliding
felipe
by
her
side
the
dear
felipe
his
eyes
wearing
the
same
bright
and
loving
look
as
of
old
what
strange
thing
was
it
which
had
happened
to
her
to
make
it
all
seem
unreal
even
the
little
one
in
her
arms
she
too
seemed
unreal
ramona
did
not
know
it
but
her
nerves
were
still
partially
paralyzed
nature
sends
merciful
anaesthetics
in
the
shocks
which
almost
kill
us
in
the
very
sharpness
of
the
blow
sometimes
lies
its
own
first
healing
it
would
be
long
before
ramona
would
fully
realize
that
alessandro
was
dead
her
worst
anguish
was
yet
to
come
felipe
did
not
know
and
could
not
have
understood
this
and
it
was
with
a
marvelling
gratitude
that
he
saw
ramona
day
after
day
placid
always
ready
with
a
smile
when
he
spoke
to
her
her
gratitude
for
each
thoughtfulness
of
his
smote
him
like
a
reproach
all
the
more
that
he
knew
her
gentle
heart
had
never
held
a
thought
of
reproach
in
it
towards
him
grateful
to
me
he
thought
to
me
who
might
have
spared
her
all
this
woe
if
i
had
been
strong
never
would
felipe
forgive
himself
no
not
to
the
day
of
his
death
his
whole
life
should
be
devoted
to
her
and
her
child
but
what
a
pitiful
thing
was
that
to
render
as
they
drew
near
home
he
saw
ramona
often
try
to
conceal
from
him
that
she
had
shed
tears
at
last
he
said
to
her
dearest
ramona
do
not
fear
to
weep
before
me
i
would
not
be
any
constraint
on
you
it
is
better
for
you
to
let
the
tears
come
freely
my
sister
they
are
healing
to
i
do
not
think
so
felipe
replied
ramona
tears
are
only
selfish
and
weak
they
are
like
a
cry
because
we
are
hurt
it
is
not
possible
always
to
keep
them
back
but
i
am
ashamed
when
i
have
wept
and
think
also
that
i
have
sinned
because
i
have
given
a
sad
sight
to
others
father
salvierderra
always
said
that
it
was
a
duty
to
look
happy
no
matter
how
much
we
might
be
that
is
more
than
human
power
can
do
said
felipe
i
think
not
replied
ramona
if
it
were
father
salvierderra
would
not
have
commanded
it
and
do
you
not
recollect
felipe
what
a
smile
his
face
always
wore
and
his
heart
had
been
broken
for
many
many
years
before
he
died
alone
in
the
night
when
he
prayed
he
used
to
weep
from
the
great
wrestling
he
had
with
god
he
told
me
but
we
never
saw
him
except
with
a
smile
when
one
thinks
in
the
wilderness
alone
felipe
many
things
become
clear
i
have
been
learning
all
these
years
in
the
wilderness
as
if
i
had
had
a
teacher
sometimes
i
almost
thought
that
the
spirit
of
father
salvierderra
was
by
my
side
putting
thoughts
into
my
mind
i
hope
i
can
tell
them
to
my
child
when
she
is
old
enough
she
will
understand
them
quicker
than
i
did
for
she
has
soul
you
can
see
that
by
her
eyes
and
all
these
things
of
which
i
speak
were
in
his
heart
from
his
childhood
they
belong
to
the
air
and
the
sky
and
the
sun
and
all
trees
know
when
ramona
spoke
thus
of
alessandro
felipe
marvelled
in
silence
he
himself
had
been
afraid
to
mention
alessandro
name
but
ramona
spoke
it
as
if
he
were
yet
by
her
side
felipe
could
not
fathom
this
there
were
to
be
many
things
yet
which
felipe
could
not
fathom
in
this
lovely
sorrowing
sunny
sister
of
his
when
they
reached
the
house
the
servants
who
had
been
on
the
watch
for
days
were
all
gathered
in
the
old
marda
and
juan
can
heading
the
group
only
two
absent
margarita
and
luigo
they
had
been
married
some
months
before
and
were
living
at
the
ortegas
ranch
where
luigo
to
juan
can
scornful
amusement
had
been
made
head
shepherd
on
all
sides
were
beaming
faces
smiles
and
glad
cries
of
greeting
underneath
these
were
affectionate
hearts
quaking
with
fear
lest
the
be
but
a
sad
one
after
all
vaguely
they
knew
a
little
of
what
their
dear
senorita
had
been
through
since
she
left
them
it
seemed
that
she
must
be
sadly
altered
by
so
much
sorrow
and
that
it
would
be
terrible
to
her
to
come
back
to
the
place
so
full
of
painful
associations
and
the
senora
gone
too
said
one
of
the
outdoor
hands
as
they
were
talking
it
over
it
not
the
same
place
at
all
that
it
was
when
the
senora
was
humph
muttered
juan
can
more
consequential
and
overbearing
than
ever
for
this
year
of
absolute
control
of
the
estate
humph
all
you
know
a
good
thing
the
senora
died
when
she
did
i
can
tell
you
we
never
have
seen
the
senorita
back
here
else
i
can
tell
you
that
my
man
and
for
my
part
i
much
rather
be
under
senor
felipe
and
the
senorita
than
under
the
senora
peace
to
her
ashes
she
had
her
day
they
can
have
theirs
when
these
loving
and
excited
retainers
saw
ramona
pale
but
with
her
own
old
smile
on
her
face
coming
towards
them
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
they
broke
into
wild
cheering
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
group
singling
out
old
marda
by
a
glance
ramona
held
out
the
baby
towards
her
and
said
in
her
old
gentle
affectionate
voice
i
am
sure
you
will
love
my
baby
marda
senorita
senorita
god
bless
you
senorita
they
cried
and
closed
up
their
ranks
around
the
baby
touching
her
praising
her
handing
her
from
one
to
another
ramona
stood
for
a
few
seconds
watching
them
then
she
said
give
her
to
me
marda
i
will
myself
carry
her
into
the
house
and
she
moved
toward
the
inner
door
this
way
dear
this
way
cried
felipe
it
is
father
room
i
ordered
to
be
prepared
for
you
because
it
is
so
sunny
for
the
baby
thanks
kind
felipe
cried
ramona
and
her
eyes
said
more
than
her
words
she
knew
he
had
divined
the
one
thing
she
had
most
dreaded
in
returning
the
crossing
again
the
threshold
of
her
own
room
it
would
be
long
now
before
she
would
enter
that
room
perhaps
she
would
never
enter
it
how
tender
and
wise
of
felipe
yes
felipe
was
both
tender
and
wise
now
how
long
would
the
wisdom
hold
the
tenderness
in
leash
as
he
day
after
day
looked
upon
the
face
of
this
beautiful
woman
so
much
more
beautiful
now
than
she
had
been
before
her
marriage
that
felipe
sometimes
as
he
gazed
at
her
thought
her
changed
even
in
feature
but
in
this
very
change
lay
a
spell
which
would
for
a
long
time
surround
her
and
set
her
as
apart
from
thoughts
as
if
she
were
guarded
by
a
cordon
of
viewless
spirits
there
was
a
rapt
look
of
holy
communion
on
her
face
which
made
itself
felt
by
the
dullest
perception
and
sometimes
overawed
even
where
it
attracted
it
was
the
same
thing
which
aunt
ri
had
felt
and
formulated
in
her
own
humorous
fashion
but
old
marda
put
it
better
when
one
day
in
reply
to
a
suggestion
of
juan
can
to
the
effect
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
senor
felipe
had
married
the
senorita
years
ago
what
if
he
were
to
do
it
yet
she
said
also
under
her
breath
it
is
my
opinion
he
as
soon
think
of
saint
catharine
herself
not
but
that
it
would
be
a
great
thing
if
it
could
be
and
now
the
thing
that
the
senora
had
imagined
to
herself
so
often
had
come
about
the
presence
of
a
little
child
in
her
house
on
the
veranda
in
the
garden
everywhere
the
sunny
joyous
blest
presence
but
how
differently
had
it
come
not
felipe
child
as
she
proudly
had
pictured
but
the
child
of
ramona
the
friendless
banished
ramona
returned
now
into
full
honor
and
peace
as
the
daughter
of
the
house
ramona
widow
of
alessandro
if
the
child
had
been
felipe
own
he
could
not
have
felt
for
it
a
greater
love
from
the
first
the
little
thing
had
clung
to
him
as
only
second
to
her
mother
she
slept
hours
in
his
arms
one
little
hand
hid
in
his
dark
beard
close
to
his
lips
and
kissed
again
and
again
when
no
one
saw
next
to
ramona
herself
in
felipe
heart
came
ramona
child
and
on
the
child
he
could
lavish
the
fondness
he
felt
that
he
could
never
dare
to
show
to
the
mother
month
by
month
it
grew
clearer
to
felipe
that
the
mainsprings
of
life
were
no
longer
of
this
earth
that
she
walked
as
one
in
constant
fellowship
with
one
unseen
her
frequent
and
calm
mention
of
alessandro
did
not
deceive
him
it
did
not
mean
a
lessening
grief
it
meant
an
unchanged
relation
one
thing
weighed
heavily
on
felipe
mind
the
concealed
treasure
a
sense
of
humiliation
withheld
him
day
after
day
from
speaking
of
it
but
he
could
have
no
peace
until
ramona
knew
it
each
hour
that
he
delayed
the
revelation
he
felt
himself
almost
as
guilty
as
he
had
held
his
mother
to
be
at
last
he
spoke
he
had
not
said
many
words
before
ramona
interrupted
him
oh
yes
she
said
i
knew
about
those
things
your
mother
told
me
when
we
were
in
such
trouble
i
used
to
wish
sometimes
we
could
have
had
a
few
of
the
jewels
but
they
were
all
given
to
the
church
that
was
what
the
senora
ortegna
said
must
be
done
with
them
if
i
married
against
your
mother
it
was
with
a
voice
that
felipe
replied
dear
ramona
they
were
not
given
to
the
church
you
know
father
salvierderra
died
and
i
suppose
my
mother
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
she
told
me
about
them
just
as
she
was
but
why
did
you
not
give
them
to
the
church
dear
asked
ramona
simply
why
cried
felipe
because
i
hold
them
to
be
yours
and
yours
only
i
would
never
have
given
them
to
the
church
until
i
had
sure
proof
that
you
were
dead
and
had
left
no
ramona
eyes
were
fixed
earnestly
on
felipe
face
you
have
not
read
the
senora
ortegna
letter
she
said
yes
i
have
he
replied
every
word
of
but
that
said
i
was
not
to
have
any
of
the
things
if
i
married
against
the
senora
moreno
felipe
groaned
had
his
mother
lied
no
dear
he
said
that
was
not
the
word
it
was
if
you
married
ramona
reflected
i
never
recollected
the
words
she
said
i
was
too
frightened
but
i
thought
that
was
what
it
meant
i
did
not
marry
unworthily
do
you
feel
sure
felipe
that
it
would
be
honest
for
me
to
take
them
for
my
child
perfectly
said
felipe
do
you
think
father
salvierderra
would
say
i
ought
to
keep
them
i
am
sure
of
it
i
will
think
about
it
felipe
i
can
not
decide
hastily
your
mother
did
not
think
i
had
any
right
to
them
if
i
married
alessandro
that
was
why
she
showed
them
to
me
i
never
knew
of
them
till
then
i
took
one
thing
a
handkerchief
of
my
father
i
was
very
glad
to
have
it
but
it
got
lost
when
we
went
from
san
pasquale
alessandro
rode
back
a
journey
to
find
it
for
me
but
it
had
blown
away
i
grieved
sorely
for
the
next
day
ramona
said
to
felipe
dear
felipe
i
have
thought
it
all
over
about
those
jewels
i
believe
it
will
be
right
for
my
daughter
to
have
them
can
there
be
some
kind
of
a
paper
written
for
me
to
sign
to
say
that
if
she
dies
they
are
all
to
be
given
to
the
church
to
father
salvierderra
college
in
santa
barbara
that
is
where
i
would
rather
have
them
yes
dear
said
felipe
and
then
we
will
put
them
in
some
safer
place
i
will
take
them
to
los
angeles
when
i
go
it
is
wonderful
no
one
has
stolen
them
all
these
years
and
so
a
second
time
the
ortegna
jewels
were
passed
on
by
a
written
bequest
into
the
keeping
of
that
mysterious
certain
uncertain
thing
we
call
the
future
and
delude
our
selves
with
the
fancy
that
we
can
have
much
to
do
with
its
shaping
life
ran
smoothly
in
the
moreno
household
smoothly
to
the
eye
nothing
could
be
more
peaceful
fairer
to
see
than
the
routine
of
its
days
with
the
simple
pleasures
light
tasks
and
easy
diligence
of
all
summer
and
winter
were
alike
sunny
and
had
each
its
own
joys
there
was
not
an
antagonistic
or
jarring
element
and
flitting
back
and
forth
from
veranda
to
veranda
garden
to
garden
room
to
room
equally
at
home
and
equally
welcome
everywhere
there
went
perpetually
running
frisking
laughing
rejoicing
the
little
child
that
had
so
strangely
drifted
into
this
happy
shelter
the
little
ramona
as
unconscious
of
aught
sad
or
fateful
in
her
destiny
as
the
blossoms
with
which
it
was
her
delight
to
play
she
sometimes
seemed
to
her
mother
to
have
been
from
the
first
in
some
mysterious
way
disconnected
from
it
removed
set
free
from
all
that
could
ever
by
any
possibility
link
her
to
sorrow
ramona
herself
bore
no
impress
of
sorrow
rather
her
face
had
now
an
added
radiance
there
had
been
a
period
soon
after
her
return
when
she
felt
that
she
for
the
first
time
waked
to
the
realization
of
her
bereavement
when
every
sight
sound
and
place
seemed
to
cry
out
mocking
her
with
the
name
and
the
memory
of
alessandro
but
she
wrestled
with
this
absorbing
grief
as
with
a
sin
setting
her
will
steadfastly
to
the
purposes
of
each
day
duty
and
most
of
all
to
the
duty
of
joyfulness
she
repeated
to
herself
father
salvierderra
sayings
till
she
more
than
knew
them
by
heart
and
she
spent
long
hours
of
the
night
in
prayer
as
it
had
been
his
wont
to
do
no
one
but
felipe
dreamed
of
these
vigils
and
wrestlings
he
knew
them
and
he
knew
too
when
they
ceased
and
the
new
light
of
a
new
victory
diffused
itself
over
ramona
face
but
neither
did
the
first
dishearten
nor
the
latter
encourage
him
felipe
was
a
lover
now
than
he
had
been
in
his
earlier
youth
he
knew
that
into
the
world
where
ramona
really
lived
he
did
not
so
much
as
enter
yet
her
every
act
word
look
was
full
of
loving
thoughtfulness
of
and
for
him
loving
happiness
in
his
companionship
and
while
this
was
so
all
felipe
unrest
could
not
make
him
unhappy
there
were
other
causes
entering
into
this
unrest
besides
his
yearning
desire
to
win
ramona
for
his
wife
year
by
year
the
conditions
of
life
in
california
were
growing
more
distasteful
to
him
the
methods
aims
standards
of
the
fast
incoming
americans
were
to
him
odious
their
boasted
successes
the
crowding
of
colonies
schemes
of
settlement
and
development
all
were
disagreeable
and
irritating
the
passion
for
money
and
reckless
spending
of
it
the
great
fortunes
made
in
one
hour
thrown
away
in
another
savored
to
felipe
mind
more
of
brigandage
and
gambling
than
of
the
occupations
of
gentlemen
he
loathed
them
life
under
the
new
government
grew
more
and
more
intolerable
to
him
both
his
hereditary
instincts
and
prejudices
and
his
temperament
revolted
he
found
himself
more
and
more
alone
in
the
country
even
the
spanish
tongue
was
less
and
less
spoken
he
was
beginning
to
yearn
for
mexico
for
mexico
which
he
had
never
seen
yet
yearned
for
like
an
exile
there
he
might
yet
live
among
men
of
his
own
race
and
degree
and
of
congenial
beliefs
and
occupations
whenever
he
thought
of
this
change
always
came
the
quick
memory
of
ramona
would
she
be
willing
to
go
could
it
be
that
she
felt
a
bond
to
this
land
in
which
she
had
known
nothing
but
sufferings
at
last
he
asked
her
to
his
unutterable
surprise
ramona
cried
felipe
the
saints
be
praised
i
should
never
have
told
you
i
did
not
think
that
you
could
wish
to
leave
this
estate
but
my
most
beautiful
dream
for
ramona
would
be
that
she
should
grow
up
in
and
as
she
spoke
felipe
understood
by
a
lightning
intuition
and
wondered
that
he
had
not
foreknown
it
that
she
would
spare
her
daughter
the
burden
she
had
gladly
heroically
borne
herself
in
the
bond
of
race
the
question
was
settled
with
gladness
of
heart
almost
more
than
he
could
have
believed
possible
felipe
at
once
communicated
with
some
rich
american
proprietors
who
had
desired
to
buy
the
moreno
estate
land
in
the
valley
had
so
greatly
advanced
in
value
that
the
sum
he
received
for
it
was
larger
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
was
ample
for
the
realization
of
all
his
plans
for
the
new
life
in
mexico
from
the
hour
that
this
was
determined
and
the
time
for
their
sailing
fixed
a
new
expression
came
into
ramona
face
her
imagination
was
kindled
an
untried
future
beckoned
a
future
which
she
would
embrace
and
conquer
for
her
daughter
felipe
saw
the
look
felt
the
change
and
for
the
first
time
hoped
it
would
be
a
new
world
a
new
life
why
not
a
new
love
she
could
not
always
be
blind
to
his
devotion
and
when
she
saw
it
could
she
refuse
to
reward
it
he
would
be
very
patient
and
wait
long
he
thought
surely
since
he
had
been
patient
so
long
without
hope
he
could
be
still
more
patient
now
that
hope
had
dawned
but
patience
is
not
hope
province
in
breasts
of
lovers
from
the
day
when
felipe
first
thought
to
himself
she
will
yet
be
mine
it
grew
harder
and
not
easier
for
him
to
refrain
from
pouring
out
his
love
in
words
her
tender
sisterliness
which
had
been
such
balm
and
comfort
to
him
grew
at
times
intolerable
and
again
and
again
her
gentle
spirit
was
deeply
disquieted
with
the
fear
that
she
had
displeased
him
so
strangely
did
he
conduct
himself
he
had
resolved
that
nothing
should
tempt
him
to
disclose
to
her
his
passion
and
its
dreams
until
they
had
reached
their
new
home
but
there
came
a
moment
which
mastered
him
and
he
spoke
it
was
in
monterey
they
were
to
sail
on
the
morrow
and
had
been
on
board
the
ship
to
complete
the
last
arrangements
they
were
rowed
back
to
shore
in
a
little
boat
a
full
moon
shone
ramona
sat
bareheaded
in
the
end
of
the
boat
and
the
silver
radiance
from
the
water
seemed
to
float
up
around
her
and
invest
her
as
with
a
myriad
halos
felipe
gazed
at
her
till
his
senses
swam
and
when
on
stepping
from
the
boat
she
put
her
hand
in
his
and
said
as
she
had
said
hundreds
of
times
before
dear
felipe
how
good
you
are
he
clasped
her
hands
wildly
and
cried
ramona
my
love
oh
can
you
not
love
me
the
moonlight
was
bright
as
day
they
were
alone
on
the
shore
ramona
gazed
at
him
for
one
second
in
surprise
only
for
a
second
then
she
knew
all
felipe
my
brother
she
cried
and
stretched
out
her
hands
as
if
in
warning
no
i
am
not
your
brother
he
cried
i
will
not
be
your
brother
i
would
rather
die
felipe
cried
ramona
again
this
time
her
voice
recalled
him
to
himself
it
was
a
voice
of
terror
and
of
pain
forgive
me
my
sweet
one
he
exclaimed
i
will
never
say
it
again
but
i
have
loved
you
so
long
so
long
ramona
head
had
fallen
forward
on
her
breast
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
shining
sands
the
waves
rose
and
fell
rose
and
fell
at
her
feet
gently
as
sighs
a
great
revelation
had
come
to
ramona
in
this
supreme
moment
of
felipe
abandonment
of
all
disguises
she
saw
his
whole
past
life
in
a
new
light
remorse
smote
her
dear
felipe
she
said
clasping
her
hands
i
have
been
very
selfish
i
did
not
know
of
course
you
did
not
love
said
felipe
how
could
you
but
i
have
never
loved
any
one
else
i
have
always
loved
you
can
you
not
learn
to
love
me
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
for
a
long
time
yet
but
now
i
have
spoken
i
can
not
hide
it
any
ramona
drew
nearer
to
him
still
with
her
hands
clasped
i
have
always
loved
you
she
said
i
love
no
other
living
man
but
felipe
her
voice
sank
to
a
solemn
whisper
do
you
not
know
felipe
that
part
of
me
is
dead
dead
can
never
live
again
you
could
not
want
me
for
your
wife
felipe
when
part
of
me
is
dead
felipe
threw
his
arms
around
her
he
was
beside
himself
with
joy
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
did
not
think
you
could
be
my
wife
he
cried
only
give
yourself
to
me
my
love
i
care
not
whether
you
call
yourself
dead
or
alive
ramona
stood
quietly
in
his
arms
ah
well
for
felipe
that
he
did
not
know
never
could
know
the
ramona
that
alessandro
had
known
this
gentle
faithful
grateful
ramona
asking
herself
fervently
now
if
she
would
do
her
brother
a
wrong
yielding
up
to
him
what
seemed
to
her
only
the
broken
fragment
of
a
life
weighing
his
words
not
in
the
light
of
passion
but
of
calmest
most
unselfish
action
ah
how
unlike
was
she
to
that
ramona
who
flung
herself
on
alessandro
breast
crying
take
me
with
you
i
would
rather
die
than
have
you
leave
me
ramona
had
spoken
truth
part
of
her
was
dead
but
ramona
saw
now
with
infallible
intuition
that
even
as
she
had
loved
alessandro
so
felipe
loved
her
could
she
refuse
to
give
felipe
happiness
when
he
had
saved
her
saved
her
child
what
else
now
remained
for
them
these
words
having
been
spoken
i
will
be
your
wife
dear
felipe
she
said
speaking
solemnly
slowly
if
you
are
sure
it
will
make
you
happy
and
if
you
think
it
is
right
ejaculated
felipe
mad
with
the
joy
unlooked
for
so
soon
nothing
else
would
be
right
my
ramona
i
will
love
you
so
you
will
forget
you
ever
said
that
part
of
you
was
dead
a
strange
look
which
startled
felipe
swept
across
ramona
face
it
might
have
been
a
moonbeam
it
passed
felipe
never
saw
it
again
general
moreno
name
was
still
held
in
warm
remembrance
in
the
city
of
mexico
and
felipe
found
himself
at
once
among
friends
on
the
day
after
their
arrival
he
and
ramona
were
married
in
the
cathedral
old
marda
and
juan
can
with
his
crutches
kneeling
in
proud
joy
behind
them
the
story
of
the
romance
of
their
lives
being
widely
rumored
greatly
enhanced
the
interest
with
which
they
were
welcomed
the
beautiful
young
senora
moreno
was
the
theme
of
the
city
and
felipe
bosom
thrilled
with
pride
to
see
the
gentle
dignity
of
demeanor
by
which
she
was
distinguished
in
all
assemblages
it
was
indeed
a
new
world
a
new
life
ramona
might
well
doubt
her
own
identity
but
undying
memories
stood
like
sentinels
in
her
breast
when
the
notes
of
doves
calling
to
each
other
fell
on
her
ear
her
eyes
sought
the
sky
and
she
heard
a
voice
saying
majella
this
was
the
only
secret
her
loyal
loving
heart
had
kept
from
felipe
a
loyal
loving
heart
indeed
it
was
loyal
loving
serene
few
husbands
so
blest
as
the
senor
felipe
moreno
sons
and
daughters
came
to
bear
his
name
the
daughters
were
all
beautiful
but
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
and
it
was
said
the
most
beloved
by
both
father
and
mother
was
the
eldest
one
the
one
who
bore
the
mother
name
and
was
only
to
the
senor
ramona
ramona
daughter
of
alessandro
the
indian
