once
my
darlings
played
together
beneath

boughs
which
faded
long

made
merry
in
the
golden
summer
weather
pelted
each
other
with
snow

the
sun
always
shine
i

remember
a
single
cloud
that
dimmed
the
happy
blue
a
single
or
peal
of
thunder
to
daunt
our
bright
unfearing
lives
can
you
we
quarrelled
often
but
made
peace
as
quickly
shed
many
tears
but
laughed
the
while
they
fell
had
our
small
woes
our
childish
bumps
and
bruises
but
mother
always
kissed
and
made
them
well
is
it
long
since
it
seems
a
moment
only
yet
here
we
are
in
bonnets
and
grave
men
of
business
members
of
committees
our
ended
even
baby
votes
and
children
in
whose
innocent
faces
kindles
the
gladness
which
was
once
our
own
crowd
round
our
knees
with
sweet
and
coaxing
voices
asking
for
stories
of
that
home
were
once
little
too
they
say
astonished
did
you
too
play
how
funny
tell
us
how
almost
we
start
forgetful
for
a
moment
almost
we
answer
we
are
little
dear
friend
and
lover
whom
we
christen
forgive
such
brief
bewilderment
thy
true
and
kindly
hand
we
hold
we
own
thee
fairest
but
ah
our
yesterday
was
precious
too
so
darlings
take
this
little
childish
story
in
which
some
gleams
of
the
old
sunshine
play
and

with
careless

at

chapter
i
the
little
carrs
i
was
sitting
in
the
meadows
one
day
not
long
ago
at
a
place
where
there
was
a
small
brook
it
was
a
hot
day
the
sky
was
very
blue
and
white
clouds
like
great
swans
went
floating
over
it
to
and
fro
just
opposite
me
was
a
clump
of
green
rushes
with
dark
velvety
spikes
and
among
them
one
single
tall
red
cardinal
flower
which
was
bending
over
the
brook
as
if
to
see
its
own
beautiful
face
in
the
water
but
the
cardinal
did
not
seem
to
be
vain
the
picture
was
so
pretty
that
i
sat
a
long
time
enjoying
it
suddenly
close
to
me
two
small
voices
began
to
talk
or
to
sing
for
i
tell
exactly
which
it
was
one
voice
was
shrill
the
other
which
was
a
little
deeper
sounded
very
positive
and
cross
they
were
evidently
disputing
about
something
for
they
said
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
these
were
the
words
katy
did
katy
did
she
did
she
did
she
did
she
did
did
did
i
think
they
must
have
repeated
them
at
least
a
hundred
times
i
got
up
from
my
seat
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
speakers
and
sure
enough
there
on
one
of
the
bulrushes
i
spied
two
tiny
creatures
their
eyes
seemed
to
be
weak
for
they
both
wore
black
goggles
they
had
six
legs
apiece
two
short
ones
two
not
so
short
and
two
very
long
these
last
legs
had
joints
like
the
springs
to
and
as
i
watched
they
began
walking
up
the
rush
and
then
i
saw
that
they
moved
exactly
like
an
gig
in
fact
if
i
had
been
too
big
i
i
should
have
heard
them
creak
as
they
went
along
they
did
say
anything
so
long
as
i
was
there
but
the
moment
my
back
was
turned
they
began
to
quarrel
again
and
in
the
same
old
words
katy
did
katy
did
she
did
she
did
as
i
walked
home
i
fell
to
thinking
about
another
katy
a
katy
i
once
knew
who
planned
to
do
a
great
many
wonderful
things
and
in
the
end
did
none
of
them
but
something
quite
different
something
she
like
at
all
at
first
but
which
on
the
whole
was
a
great
deal
better
than
any
of
the
doings
she
had
dreamed
about
and
as
i
thought
this
little
story
grew
in
my
head
and
i
resolved
to
write
it
down
for
you
i
have
done
it
and
in
memory
of
my
two
little
friends
on
the
bulrush
i
give
it
their
name
here
it
is
the
story
of
what
katy
did
katy
name
was
katy
carr
she
lived
in
the
town
of
burnet
which
a
very
big
town
but
was
growing
as
fast
as
it
knew
how
the
house
she
lived
in
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
town
it
was
a
large
square
house
white
with
green
blinds
and
had
a
porch
in
front
over
which
roses
and
clematis
made
a
thick
bower
four
tall
locust
trees
shaded
the
gravel
path
which
led
to
the
front
gate
on
one
side
of
the
house
was
an
orchard
on
the
other
side
were
wood
piles
and
barns
and
an
behind
was
a
kitchen
garden
sloping
to
the
south
and
behind
that
a
pasture
with
a
brook
in
it
and
butternut
trees
and
four
cows
two
red
ones
a
yellow
one
with
sharp
horns
tipped
with
tin
and
a
dear
little
white
one
named
daisy
there
were
six
of
the
carr
children
four
girls
and
two
boys
katy
the
oldest
was
twelve
years
old
little
phil
the
youngest
was
four
and
the
rest
fitted
in
between
carr
their
papa
was
a
dear
kind
busy
man
who
was
away
from
home
all
day
and
sometimes
all
night
too
taking
care
of
sick
people
the
children
had
any
mamma
she
had
died
when
phil
was
a
baby
four
years
before
my
story
began
katy
could
remember
her
pretty
well
to
the
rest
she
was
but
a
sad
sweet
name
spoken
on
sunday
and
at
or
when
papa
was
especially
gentle
and
solemn
in
place
of
this
mamma
whom
they
recollected
so
dimly
there
was
aunt
izzie
papa
sister
who
came
to
take
care
of
them
when
mamma
went
away
on
that
long
journey
from
which
for
so
many
months
the
little
ones
kept
hoping
she
might
return
aunt
izzie
was
a
small
woman
and
thin
rather
and
very
neat
and
particular
about
everything
she
meant
to
be
kind
to
the
children
but
they
puzzled
her
much
because
they
were
not
a
bit
like
herself
when
she
was
a
child
aunt
izzie
had
been
a
gentle
tidy
little
thing
who
loved
to
sit
as
curly
locks
did
sewing
long
seams
in
the
parlor
and
to
have
her
head
patted
by
older
people
and
be
told
that
she
was
a
good
girl
whereas
katy
tore
her
dress
every
day
hated
sewing
and
did
care
a
button
about
being
called
good
while
clover
and
elsie
shied
off
like
restless
ponies
when
any
one
tried
to
pat
their
heads
it
was
very
perplexing
to
aunt
izzie
and
she
found
it
hard
to
quite
forgive
the
children
for
being
so
unaccountable
and
so
little
like
the
good
boys
and
girls
in
memoirs
who
were
the
young
people
she
liked
best
and
understood
most
about
then
carr
was
another
person
who
worried
her
he
wished
to
have
the
children
hardy
and
bold
and
encouraged
climbing
and
rough
plays
in
spite
of
the
bumps
and
ragged
clothes
which
resulted
in
fact
there
was
just
one
of
the
day
when
aunt
izzie
was
really
satisfied
about
her
charges
and
that
was
the
before
breakfast
when
she
had
made
a
law
that
they
were
all
to
sit
in
their
little
chairs
and
learn
the
bible
verse
for
the
day
at
this
time
she
looked
at
them
with
pleased
eyes
they
were
all
so
spick
and
span
with
such
jackets
and
such
hair
but
the
moment
the
bell
rang
her
comfort
was
over
from
that
time
on
they
were
what
she
called
not
fit
to
be
seen
the
neighbors
pitied
her
very
much
they
used
to
count
the
sixty
stiff
white
pantalette
legs
hung
out
to
dry
every
monday
morning
and
say
to
each
other
what
a
sight
of
washing
those
children
made
and
what
a
chore
it
must
be
for
poor
miss
carr
to
keep
them
so
nice
but
poor
miss
carr
did
think
them
at
all
nice
that
was
the
worst
of
it
clover
go
up
stairs
and
wash
your
hands
dorry
pick
your
hat
off
the
floor
and
hang
it
on
the
nail
not
that
nail
the
third
nail
from
the
corner
these
were
the
kind
of
things
aunt
izzie
was
saying
all
day
long
the
children
minded
her
pretty
well
but
they
did
exactly
love
her
i
fear
they
called
her
aunt
izzie
always
never
aunty
boys
and
girls
will
know
what
meant
i
want
to
show
you
the
little
carrs
and
i
do
know
that
i
could
ever
have
a
better
chance
than
one
day
when
five
out
of
the
six
were
perched
on
top
of
the
like
chickens
on
a
roost
this
was
one
of
their
favorite
places
it
was
only
a
low
roof
set
over
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
as
it
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
it
always
seemed
to
the
children
that
the
shortest
road
to
every
place
was
up
one
of
its
slopes
and
down
the
other
they
also
liked
to
mount
to
the
and
then
still
keeping
the
sitting
position
to
let
go
and
scrape
slowly
down
over
the
warm
shingles
to
the
ground
it
was
bad
for
their
shoes
and
trousers
of
course
but
what
of
that
shoes
and
trousers
and
clothes
generally
were
aunt
izzie
affair
theirs
was
to
slide
and
enjoy
themselves
clover
next
in
age
to
katy
sat
in
the
middle
she
was
a
fair
sweet
dumpling
of
a
girl
with
thick
of
light
brown
hair
and
blue
eyes
which
seemed
to
hold
tears
just
ready
to
fall
from
under
the
blue
really
clover
was
the
jolliest
little
thing
in
the
world
but
these
eyes
and
her
soft
cooing
voice
always
made
people
feel
like
petting
her
and
taking
her
part
once
when
she
was
very
small
she
ran
away
with
katy
doll
and
when
katy
pursued
and
tried
to
take
it
from
her
clover
held
fast
and
would
not
let
go
carr
who
was
attending
particularly
heard
nothing
but
the
pathetic
tone
of
clover
voice
as
she
said
me
wo
me
want
dolly
and
without
stopping
to
inquire
he
called
out
sharply
for
shame
katy
give
your
sister
doll
at
once
which
katy
much
surprised
did
while
clover
purred
in
triumph
like
a
satisfied
kitten
clover
was
sunny
and
a
little
indolent
and
very
modest
about
herself
though
in
fact
she
was
particularly
clever
in
all
sorts
of
games
and
extremely
droll
and
funny
in
a
quiet
way
everybody
loved
her
and
she
loved
everybody
especially
katy
whom
she
looked
up
to
as
one
of
the
wisest
people
in
the
world
pretty
little
phil
sat
next
on
the
roof
to
clover
and
she
held
him
tight
with
her
arm
then
came
elsie
a
thin
brown
child
of
eight
with
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
crisp
short
curls
covering
the
whole
of
her
small
head
poor
little
elsie
was
the
odd
one
among
the
carrs
she
did
seem
to
belong
exactly
to
either
the
older
or
the
younger
children
the
great
desire
and
ambition
of
her
heart
was
to
be
allowed
to
go
about
with
katy
and
clover
and
cecy
hall
and
to
know
their
secrets
and
be
permitted
to
put
notes
into
the
little
they
were
forever
establishing
in
all
sorts
of
hidden
places
but
they
want
elsie
and
used
to
tell
her
to
run
away
and
play
with
the
children
which
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
when
she
would
run
away
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
ran
away
from
her
which
as
their
legs
were
longest
it
was
easy
to
do
poor
elsie
left
behind
would
cry
bitter
tears
and
as
she
was
too
proud
to
play
much
with
dorry
and
john
her
principal
comfort
was
tracking
the
older
ones
about
and
discovering
their
mysteries
especially
the
which
were
her
greatest
grievance
her
eyes
were
bright
and
quick
as
a
bird
she
would
peep
and
peer
and
follow
and
watch
till
at
last
in
some
odd
unlikely
place
the
crotch
of
a
tree
the
middle
of
the
asparagus
bed
or
perhaps
on
the
very
top
step
of
the
scuttle
ladder
she
spied
the
little
paper
box
with
its
load
of
notes
all
ending
with
be
sure
and
not
let
elsie
know
then
she
would
seize
the
box
and
marching
up
to
wherever
the
others
were
she
would
throw
it
down
saying
defiantly
there
your
old
but
feeling
all
the
time
just
like
crying
poor
little
elsie
in
almost
every
big
family
there
is
one
of
these
unmated
children
katy
who
had
the
finest
plans
in
the
world
for
being
heroic
and
of
use
never
saw
as
she
drifted
on
her
heedless
way
that
here
in
this
lonely
little
sister
was
the
very
chance
she
wanted
for
being
a
comfort
to
somebody
who
needed
comfort
very
much
she
never
saw
it
and
elsie
heavy
heart
went
uncheered
dorry
and
joanna
sat
on
the
two
ends
of
the
dorry
was
six
years
old
a
pale
pudgy
boy
with
rather
a
solemn
face
and
smears
of
molasses
on
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
joanna
whom
the
children
called
john
and
johnnie
was
a
square
splendid
child
a
year
younger
than
dorry
she
had
big
brave
eyes
and
a
wide
rosy
mouth
which
always
looked
ready
to
laugh
these
two
were
great
friends
though
dorry
seemed
like
a
girl
who
had
got
into
boy
clothes
by
mistake
and
johnnie
like
a
boy
who
in
a
fit
of
fun
had
borrowed
his
sister
frock
and
now
as
they
all
sat
there
chattering
and
giggling
the
window
above
opened
a
glad
shriek
was
heard
and
katy
head
appeared
in
her
hand
she
held
a
heap
of
stockings
which
she
waved
triumphantly
hurray
she
cried
all
done
and
aunt
izzie
says
we
may
go
are
you
tired
out
waiting
i
could
help
it
the
holes
were
so
big
and
took
so
long
hurry
up
clover
and
get
the
things
cecy
and
i
will
be
down
in
a
minute
the
children
jumped
up
gladly
and
slid
down
the
roof
clover
fetched
a
couple
of
baskets
from
the
elsie
ran
for
her
kitten
dorry
and
john
loaded
themselves
with
two
great
fagots
of
green
boughs
just
as
they
were
ready
the
banged
and
katy
and
cecy
hall
came
into
the
yard
i
must
tell
you
about
cecy
she
was
a
great
friend
of
the
children
and
lived
in
a
house
next
door
the
yards
of
the
houses
were
only
separated
by
a
green
hedge
with
no
gate
so
that
cecy
spent
of
her
time
at
carr
and
was
exactly
like
one
of
the
family
she
was
a
neat
dapper
modest
and
prim
in
manner
with
light
shiny
hair
which
always
kept
smooth
and
slim
hands
which
never
looked
dirty
how
different
from
my
poor
katy
katy
hair
was
forever
in
a
snarl
her
gowns
were
always
catching
on
nails
and
tearing
themselves
and
in
spite
of
her
age
and
size
she
was
as
heedless
and
innocent
as
a
child
of
six
katy
was
the
girl
that
was
ever
seen
what
she
did
to
make
herself
grow
so
nobody
could
tell
but
there
she
was
up
above
papa
ear
and
half
a
head
taller
than
poor
aunt
izzie
whenever
she
stopped
to
think
about
her
height
she
became
very
awkward
and
felt
as
if
she
were
all
legs
and
elbows
and
angles
and
joints
happily
her
head
was
so
full
of
other
things
of
plans
and
schemes
and
fancies
of
all
sorts
that
she
did
often
take
time
to
remember
how
tall
she
was
she
was
a
dear
loving
child
for
all
her
careless
habits
and
made
bushels
of
good
resolutions
every
week
of
her
life
only
unluckily
she
never
kept
any
of
them
she
had
fits
of
responsibility
about
the
other
children
and
longed
to
set
them
a
good
example
but
when
the
chance
came
she
generally
forgot
to
do
so
days
flew
like
the
wind
for
when
she
was
studying
lessons
or
sewing
and
darning
with
aunt
izzie
which
she
hated
extremely
there
were
always
so
many
delightful
schemes
rioting
in
her
brains
that
all
she
wished
for
was
ten
pairs
of
hands
to
carry
them
out
these
same
active
brains
got
her
into
perpetual
scrapes
she
was
fond
of
building
castles
in
the
air
and
dreaming
of
the
time
when
something
she
had
done
would
make
her
famous
so
that
everybody
would
hear
of
her
and
want
to
know
her
i
do
think
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
this
wonderful
thing
was
to
be
but
while
thinking
about
it
she
often
forgot
to
learn
a
lesson
or
to
lace
her
boots
and
then
she
had
a
bad
mark
or
a
scolding
from
aunt
izzie
at
such
times
she
consoled
herself
with
planning
how
by
and
by
she
would
be
beautiful
and
beloved
and
amiable
as
an
angel
a
great
deal
was
to
happen
to
katy
before
that
time
came
her
eyes
which
were
black
were
to
turn
blue
her
nose
was
to
lengthen
and
straighten
and
her
mouth
quite
too
large
at
present
to
suit
the
part
of
a
heroine
was
to
be
made
over
into
a
sort
of
rosy
button
meantime
and
until
these
charming
changes
should
take
place
katy
forgot
her
features
as
much
as
she
could
though
still
i
think
the
person
on
earth
whom
she
most
envied
was
that
lady
on
the
outside
of
the
tricopherous
bottles
with
the
wonderful
hair
which
sweeps
the
ground
chapter
ii
paradise
the
place
to
which
the
children
were
going
was
a
sort
of
marshy
thicket
at
the
bottom
of
a
field
near
the
house
it
was
a
big
thicket
but
it
looked
big
because
the
trees
and
bushes
grew
so
closely
that
you
could
not
see
just
where
it
ended
in
winter
the
ground
was
damp
and
boggy
so
that
nobody
went
there
excepting
cows
who
do
mind
getting
their
feet
wet
but
in
summer
the
water
dried
away
and
then
it
was
all
fresh
and
green
and
full
of
delightful
things
wild
roses
and
sassafras
and
birds
nests
narrow
winding
paths
ran
here
and
there
made
by
the
cattle
as
they
wandered
to
and
fro
this
place
the
children
called
paradise
and
to
them
it
seemed
as
wide
and
endless
and
full
of
adventure
as
any
forest
of
fairy
land
the
way
to
paradise
was
through
some
wooden
bars
katy
and
cecy
climbed
these
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
while
the
smaller
ones
scrambled
underneath
once
past
the
bars
they
were
fairly
in
the
field
and
with
one
consent
they
all
began
to
run
till
they
reached
the
entrance
of
the
wood
then
they
halted
with
a
queer
look
of
hesitation
on
their
faces
it
was
always
an
exciting
occasion
to
go
to
paradise
for
the
first
time
after
the
long
winter
who
knew
what
the
fairies
might
not
have
done
since
any
of
them
had
been
there
to
see
which
path
shall
we
go
in
by
asked
clover
at
last
suppose
we
vote
said
katy
i
say
by
the
pilgrim
path
and
the
hill
of
difficulty
so
do
i
chimed
in
clover
who
always
agreed
with
katy
the
path
of
peace
is
nice
suggested
cecy
no
no
we
want
to
go
by
sassafras
path
cried
john
and
dorry
however
katy
as
usual
had
her
way
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
first
try
pilgrim
path
and
afterward
make
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
whole
of
their
little
kingdom
and
see
all
that
had
happened
since
last
they
were
there
so
in
they
marched
katy
and
cecy
heading
the
procession
and
dorry
with
his
great
trailing
bunch
of
boughs
bringing
up
the
rear
oh
there
is
the
dear
rosary
all
safe
cried
the
children
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
of
difficulty
and
came
upon
a
tall
stump
out
of
the
middle
of
which
waved
a
wild
budded
over
with
fresh
green
eaves
this
rosary
was
a
fascinating
thing
to
their
minds
they
were
always
inventing
stories
about
it
and
were
in
constant
terror
lest
some
hungry
cow
should
take
a
fancy
to
the
and
eat
it
up
yes
said
katy
stroking
a
leaf
with
her
finger
it
was
in
great
danger
one
night
last
winter
but
it
escaped
oh
how
tell
us
about
it
cried
the
others
for
katy
stories
were
famous
in
the
family
it
was
christmas
eve
continued
katy
in
a
mysterious
tone
the
fairy
of
the
rosary
was
quite
sick
she
had
taken
a
dreadful
cold
in
her
head
and
the
fairy
just
over
there
told
her
that
sassafras
tea
is
good
for
colds
so
she
made
a
large
full
and
then
cuddled
herself
in
where
the
wood
looks
so
black
and
soft
and
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
she
was
snoring
soundly
there
was
a
noise
in
the
forest
and
a
dreadful
black
bull
with
fiery
eyes
galloped
up
he
saw
our
poor
rosy
posy
and
opening
his
big
mouth
he
was
just
going
to
bite
her
in
two
but
at
that
minute
a
little
fat
man
with
a
wand
in
his
hand
popped
out
from
behind
the
stump
it
was
santa
claus
of
course
he
gave
the
bull
such
a
rap
with
his
wand
that
he
dreadfully
and
then
put
up
his
to
see
if
his
nose
was
on
or
not
he
found
it
was
but
it
hurt
him
so
that
he
again
and
galloped
off
as
fast
as
he
could
into
the
woods
then
santa
claus
waked
up
the
fairy
and
told
her
that
if
she
did
take
better
care
of
rosy
posy
he
should
put
some
other
fairy
into
her
place
and
set
her
to
keep
guard
over
a
prickly
scratchy
is
there
really
any
fairy
asked
dorry
who
had
listened
to
this
narrative
with
open
mouth
of
course
answered
katy
then
bending
down
toward
dorry
she
added
in
a
voice
intended
to
be
of
wonderful
sweetness
i
am
a
fairy
dorry
pshaw
was
dorry
reply
you
a
giraffe
pa
said
so
the
path
of
peace
got
its
name
because
of
its
darkness
and
coolness
high
bushes
almost
met
over
it
and
trees
kept
it
shady
even
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
sort
of
white
flower
grew
there
which
the
children
called
pollypods
because
they
did
know
the
real
name
they
staid
a
long
while
picking
bunches
of
these
flowers
and
then
john
and
dorry
had
to
grub
up
an
armful
of
sassafras
roots
so
that
before
they
had
fairly
gone
through
toadstool
avenue
rabbit
hollow
and
the
rest
the
sun
was
just
over
their
heads
and
it
was
noon
i
getting
hungry
said
dorry
oh
no
dorry
you
must
be
hungry
till
the
bower
is
ready
cried
the
little
girls
alarmed
for
dorry
was
apt
to
be
disconsolate
if
he
was
kept
waiting
for
his
meals
so
they
made
haste
to
build
the
bower
it
did
not
take
long
being
composed
of
boughs
hung
over
which
were
tied
to
the
very
where
the
fairy
lived
who
had
recommended
sassafras
tea
to
the
fairy
of
the
rose
when
it
was
done
they
all
cuddled
in
underneath
it
was
a
very
small
bower
just
big
enough
to
hold
them
and
the
baskets
and
the
kitten
i
do
think
there
would
have
been
room
for
anybody
else
not
even
another
kitten
katy
who
sat
in
the
middle
untied
and
lifted
the
lid
of
the
largest
basket
while
all
the
rest
peeped
eagerly
to
see
what
was
inside
first
came
a
great
many
ginger
cakes
these
were
carefully
laid
on
the
grass
to
keep
till
wanted
buttered
biscuit
came
next
three
apiece
with
slices
of
cold
lamb
laid
in
between
and
last
of
all
were
a
dozen
eggs
and
a
layer
of
thick
bread
and
butter
sandwiched
with
aunt
izzie
had
put
up
lunches
for
paradise
before
you
see
and
knew
pretty
well
what
to
expect
in
the
way
of
appetite
oh
how
good
everything
tasted
in
that
bower
with
the
fresh
wind
rustling
the
poplar
leaves
sunshine
and
sweet
about
them
and
birds
singing
overhead
no
dinner
party
ever
had
half
so
much
fun
each
mouthful
was
a
pleasure
and
when
the
last
crumb
had
vanished
katy
produced
the
second
basket
and
there
oh
delightful
surprise
were
seven
little
pies
molasses
pies
baked
in
saucers
each
with
a
brown
top
and
crisp
candified
edge
which
tasted
like
toffy
and
and
all
sorts
of
good
things
mixed
up
together
there
was
a
general
shout
even
demure
cecy
was
pleased
and
dorry
and
john
kicked
their
heels
on
the
ground
in
a
tumult
of
joy
seven
pairs
of
hands
were
held
out
at
once
toward
the
basket
seven
sets
of
teeth
went
to
work
without
a
moment
delay
in
an
incredibly
short
time
every
vestige
of
the
pie
had
disappeared
and
a
blissful
stickiness
pervaded
the
party
what
shall
we
do
now
asked
clover
while
little
phil
tipped
the
baskets
upside
down
as
if
to
make
sure
there
was
nothing
left
that
could
possibly
be
eaten
i
do
know
replied
katy
dreamily
she
had
left
her
seat
and
was
on
the
low
crooked
bough
of
a
butternut
tree
which
hung
almost
over
the
children
heads
let
play
we
grown
up
said
cecy
and
tell
what
we
mean
to
do
well
said
clover

begin
what
do
you
mean
to
do
i
mean
to
have
a
black
silk
dress
and

over

old
woman
and
feeding
her
with
currant
jelly
a
poet
will
come
along
and
see
me
and
he

home
and

a
poem

cecy
triumphantly

a
beautiful
lady

world
and
i

on
their
way
home
i
put
lubin
extracts
on
their
handkerchiefs
i
mean
to
have
just

fired
by
this
gorgeous
vision
only

i

beautifuller

she
added
you

katy
from
overhead
clover

going
to
be
the
most
beautiful
lady
in
the
world
but
i
be
more
beautiful
than

most
beautiful
persisted
poor
little
elsie
and
i
be
big
too
and

and
everybody

kind
then
and
never
run
away
and
hide
and
there

any
post
offices
or
anything
disagreeable
what
you
be
johnnie
asked
clover
anxious
to
change
the
subject
for
elsie
voice
was
growing
plaintive
but
johnnie
had
no
clear
ideas
as
to
her
future
she
laughed
a
great
deal
and
squeezed
dorry
arm
very
tight
but
that
was
all
dorry
was
more
explicit
i
mean
to
have
turkey
every
day
he
declared
and
not
boiled
ones
you
know
but
little
baked
ones
with
brown
shiny
tops
and
a
great
deal
of
pudding
sauce
to
eat
on
them
and
i
shall
be
so
big
then
that
nobody
will
say
helps
is
quite
enough
for
a
little
boy
oh
dorry
you
pig
cried
katy
while
the
others
screamed
with
laughter
dorry
was
much
affronted
i
shall
just
go
and
tell
aunt
izzie
what
you
called
me
he
said
getting
up
in
a
great
pet
but
clover
who
was
a
born
peacemaker
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
her
coaxings
and
entreaties
consoled
him
so
much
that
he
finally
said
he
would
stay
especially
as
the
others
were
quite
grave
now
and
promised
that
they
would
laugh
any
more
and
now
katy
it
your
turn
said
cecy
tell
us
what
you
going
to
be
when
you
grow
up
i
not
sure
about
what
i
be
replied
katy
from
overhead
beautiful
of
course
and
good
if
i
can
only
not
so
good
as
you
cecy
because
it
would
be
nice
to
go
and
ride
with
the
young
gentlemen
and
i
like
to
have
a
large
house
and
a
splendiferous
garden
and
then
you
could
all
come
and
live
with
me
and
we
would
play
in
the
garden
and
dorry
should
have
turkey
five
times
a
day
if
he
liked
and
we
have
a
machine
to
darn
the
stockings
and
another
machine
to
put
the
bureau
drawers
in
order
and
we
never
sew
or
knit
garters
or
do
anything
we
did
want
to
that
what
i
like
to
but
now
i
tell
you
what
i
mean
to
is
it
the
same
thing
asked
cecy
oh
no
replied
katy
quite
different
for
you
see
i
mean
to
something
grand
i
do
know
what
yet
but
when
i
grown
up
i
shall
find
out
poor
katy
always
said
when
i
grown
up
forgetting
how
very
much
she
had
grown
already
perhaps
she
went
on
it
will
be
rowing
out
in
boats
and
saving
peoples
lives
like
that
girl
in
the
book
or
perhaps
i
shall
go
and
nurse
in
the
hospital
like
miss
nightingale
or
else
i
head
a
crusade
and
ride
on
a
white
horse
with
armor
and
a
helmet
on
my
head
and
carry
a
sacred
flag
or
if
i
do
do
that
i
paint
pictures
or
sing
or
scalp
sculp
what
is
it
you
know
make
figures
in
marble
anyhow
it
shall
be
and
when
aunt
izzie
sees
it
and
reads
about
me
in
the
newspapers
she
will
say
dear
child
i
always
knew
she
would
turn
out
an
ornament
to
the
family
people
very
often
say
afterward
that
they
knew
concluded
katy
sagaciously
oh
katy
how
beautiful
it
will
be
said
clover
clasping
her
hands
clover
believed
in
katy
as
she
did
in

be
so
silly
as
to
print
things
about
katy
carr

ended
the

and
it
seemed
as
if
only
a
minute
had
passed
since
they
stopped
laughing
over
them
before
the
long
shadows
began
to
fall
and
mary
came
to
say
that
all

must
come

feeling
that
the

delightful
saturday
was
over

that
there
would
be
another
for
a
week
but
it
was
comforting
to
remember
that
paradise
was
always
there
and
that
at
any
moment
when
kate
and
aunt
izzie
were
willing
they
had
only
to
climb
a
pair
of
bars
very
easy
ones
and
without
any
fear
of
an
angel
with
flaming
sword
to
stop

enter

take
possession

chapter
iii
the
day
of
scrapes
knight
school
to
which
katy
and
clover
and
cecy
went
stood
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
from
carr
it
was
a
low
building
and
had
a
yard
behind
it
in
which
the
girls
played
at
recess
unfortunately
next
door
to
it
was
miss
miller
school
equally
large
and
popular
and
with
a
yard
behind
it
also
only
a
high
board
fence
separated
the
two
playgrounds
knight
was
a
stout
gentle
woman
who
moved
slowly
and
had
a
face
which
made
you
think
of
an
amiable
and
cow
miss
miller
on
the
contrary
had
black
eyes
with
black
corkscrew
curls
waving
about
them
and
was
generally
brisk
and
snappy
a
constant
feud
raged
between
the
two
schools
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
the
teachers
and
the
instruction
the
knight
girls
for
some
unknown
reason
considered
themselves
genteel
and
the
miller
girls
vulgar
and
took
no
pains
to
conceal
this
opinion
while
the
miller
girls
on
the
other
hand
retaliated
by
being
as
aggravating
as
they
knew
how
they
spent
their
recesses
and
intermissions
mostly
in
making
faces
through
the
in
the
fence
and
over
the
top
of
it
when
they
could
get
there
which
was
an
easy
thing
to
do
as
the
fence
was
pretty
high
the
knight
girls
could
make
faces
too
for
all
their
gentility
their
yard
had
one
great
advantage
over
the
other
it
possessed
a
with
a
climbable
roof
which
commanded
miss
miller
premises
and
upon
this
the
girls
used
to
sit
in
rows
turning
up
their
noses
at
the
next
yard
and
irritating
the
foe
by
jeering
remarks
knights
and
millerites
the
two
schools
called
each
other
and
the
feud
raged
so
high
that
sometimes
it
was
hardly
safe
for
a
knight
to
meet
a
millerite
in
the
street
all
of
which
as
may
be
imagined
was
exceedingly
improving
both
to
the
manners
and
morals
of
the
young
ladies
concerned
one
morning
not
long
after
the
day
in
paradise
katy
was
late
she
could
not
find
her
things
her
algebra
as
she
expressed
it
had
gone
and
lost
itself
her
slate
was
missing
and
the
string
was
off
her
she
ran
about
searching
for
these
articles
and
banging
doors
till
aunt
izzie
was
out
of
patience
as
for
your
algebra
she
said
if
it
is
that
very
dirty
book
with
only
one
cover
and
scribbled
all
over
the
leaves
you
will
find
it
under
the
philly
was
playing
before
breakfast
that
it
was
a
pig
no
wonder
i
sure
for
it
looks
good
for
nothing
else
how
you
do
manage
to
spoil
your
in
this
manner
katy
i
can
not
imagine
it
is
less
than
a
month
since
your
father
got
you
a
new
algebra
and
look
at
it
now
not
fit
to
be
carried
about
i
do
wish
you
would
realize
what
books
cost
about
your
slate
she
went
on
i
know
nothing
but
here
is
the
taking
it
out
of
her
pocket
oh
thank
you
said
katy
hastily
sticking
it
on
with
a
pin
katy
carr
almost
screamed
miss
izzie
what
are
you
about
pinning
on
your
mercy
on
me
what
shiftless
thing
will
you
do
next
now
stand
still
and
do
fidget
you
stir
till
i
have
sewed
it
on
properly
it
was
easy
to
stand
still
and
not
fidget
with
aunt
izzie
fussing
away
and
lecturing
and
now
and
then
in
a
moment
of
forgetfulness
sticking
her
needle
into
one
chin
katy
bore
it
as
well
as
she
could
only
shifting
perpetually
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
now
and
then
uttering
a
little
snort
like
an
impatient
horse
the
minute
she
was
released
she
flew
into
the
kitchen
seized
the
algebra
and
rushed
like
a
whirlwind
to
the
gate
where
good
little
clover
stood
patiently
waiting
though
all
ready
herself
and
terribly
afraid
she
should
be
late
we
shall
have
to
run
gasped
katy
quite
out
of
breath
aunt
izzie
kept
me
she
has
been
so
horrid
they
did
run
as
fast
as
they
could
but
time
ran
faster
and
before
they
were
to
school
the
town
clock
struck
nine
and
all
hope
was
over
this
vexed
katy
very
much
for
though
often
late
she
was
always
eager
to
be
early
there
she
said
stopping
short
i
shall
just
tell
aunt
izzie
that
it
was
her
fault
it
is
bad
and
she
marched
into
school
in
a
very
cross
mood
a
day
begun
in
this
manner
is
pretty
sure
to
end
badly
as
most
of
us
know
all
the
morning
through
things
seemed
to
go
wrong
katy
missed
twice
in
her
grammar
lesson
and
lost
her
place
in
the
class
her
hand
shook
so
when
she
copied
her
composition
that
the
writing
not
good
at
best
turned
out
almost
illegible
so
that
knight
said
it
must
all
be
done
over
again
this
made
katy
crosser
than
ever
and
almost
before
she
thought
she
had
whispered
to
clover
how
hateful
and
then
when
just
before
recess
all
who
had
communicated
were
requested
to
stand
up
her
conscience
gave
such
a
twinge
that
she
was
forced
to
get
up
with
the
rest
and
see
a
black
mark
put
against
her
name
on
the
list
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
from
vexation
and
for
fear
the
other
girls
would
notice
them
she
made
a
bolt
for
the
yard
as
soon
as
the
bell
rang
and
mounted
up
all
alone
to
the
roof
where
she
sat
with
her
back
to
the
school
fighting
with
her
eyes
and
trying
to
get
her
face
in
order
before
the
rest
should
come
miss
miller
clock
was
about
four
minutes
slower
than
knight
so
the
next
playground
was
empty
it
was
a
warm
breezy
day
and
as
katy
sat
here
suddenly
a
gust
of
wind
came
and
seizing
her
which
was
only
half
tied
on
whirled
it
across
the
roof
she
clutched
after
it
as
it
flew
but
too
late
once
twice
thrice
it
flapped
then
it
disappeared
over
the
edge
and
katy
flying
after
saw
it
lying
a
crumpled
lilac
heap
in
the
very
middle
of
the
enemy
yard
this
was
horrible
not
merely
losing
the
bonnet
for
katy
was
comfortably
indifferent
as
to
what
became
of
her
clothes
but
to
lose
it
in
another
minute
the
miller
girls
would
be
out
already
she
seemed
to
see
them
dancing
round
the
unfortunate
bonnet
pinning
it
on
a
pole
using
it
as
a
football
waving
it
over
the
fence
and
otherwise
treating
it
as
indians
treat
a
captive
taken
in
war
was
it
to
be
endured
never
better
die
first
and
with
very
much
the
feeling
of
a
person
who
faces
destruction
rather
than
forfeit
honor
katy
set
her
teeth
and
sliding
rapidly
down
the
roof
seized
the
fence
and
with
one
bold
leap
vaulted
into
miss
miller
yard
just
then
the
recess
bell
tinkled
and
a
little
millerite
who
sat
by
the
window
and
who
for
two
seconds
had
been
dying
to
give
the
exciting
information
squeaked
out
to
the
others
there
katy
carr
in
our
out
poured
the
millerites
big
and
little
their
wrath
and
indignation
at
this
daring
invasion
can
not
be
described
with
a
howl
of
fury
they
precipitated
themselves
upon
katy
but
she
was
quick
as
they
and
holding
the
rescued
bonnet
in
her
hand
was
already
up
the
fence
there
are
moments
when
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
tall
on
this
occasion
katy
long
legs
and
arms
served
her
an
excellent
turn
nothing
but
a
daddy
long
legs
ever
climbed
so
fast
or
so
wildly
as
she
did
now
in
one
second
she
had
gained
the
top
of
the
fence
just
as
she
went
over
a
millerite
seized
her
by
the
last
foot
and
almost
dragged
her
boot
off
almost
not
quite
thanks
to
the
stout
thread
with
which
aunt
izzie
had
sewed
on
the
buttons
with
a
frantic
kick
katy
released
herself
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
assailant
go
head
over
heels
backward
while
with
a
shriek
of
triumph
and
fright
she
herself
plunged
headlong
into
the
midst
of
a
group
of
knights
they
were
listening
with
open
mouths
to
the
uproar
and
now
stood
transfixed
at
the
astonishing
spectacle
of
one
of
their
number
absolutely
returning
alive
from
the
camp
of
the
enemy
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
commotion
ensued
the
knights
were
beside
themselves
with
pride
and
triumph
katy
was
kissed
and
hugged
and
made
to
tell
her
story
over
and
over
again
while
rows
of
exulting
girls
sat
on
the
roof
to
crow
over
the
discomfited
millerites
and
when
later
the
foe
rallied
and
began
to
retort
over
the
fence
clover
armed
with
a
was
lifted
up
in
the
arms
of
one
of
the
tall
girls
to
rap
the
intruding
knuckles
as
they
appeared
on
the
top
this
she
did
with
such
that
the
millerites
were
glad
to
drop
down
again
and
mutter
vengeance
at
a
safe
distance
altogether
it
was
a
great
day
for
the
school
a
day
to
be
remembered
as
time
went
on
katy
what
with
the
excitement
of
her
adventure
and
of
being
praised
and
petted
by
the
big
girls
grew
perfectly
reckless
and
hardly
knew
what
she
said
or
did
a
good
many
of
the
scholars
lived
too
far
from
school
to
go
home
at
noon
and
were
in
the
habit
of
bringing
their
lunches
in
baskets
and
staying
all
day
katy
and
clover
were
of
this
number
this
noon
after
the
dinners
were
eaten
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
play
something
in
the
and
katy
unlucky
star
put
it
into
her
head
to
invent
a
new
game
which
she
called
the
game
of
rivers
it
was
played
in
the
following
manner
each
girl
took
the
name
of
a
river
and
laid
out
for
herself
an
appointed
path
through
the
room
winding
among
the
desks
and
benches
and
making
a
low
roaring
sound
to
imitate
the
noise
of
water
cecy
was
the
platte
marianne
brooks
a
tall
girl
the
mississippi
alice
blair
the
ohio
clover
the
penobscot
and
so
on
they
were
instructed
to
run
into
each
other
once
in
a
while
because
as
katy
said
rivers
do
as
for
katy
herself
she
was
father
ocean
and
growling
horribly
raged
up
and
down
the
platform
where
knight
usually
sat
every
now
and
then
when
the
others
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
would
suddenly
cry
out
now
for
a
meeting
of
the
waters
whereupon
all
the
rivers
bouncing
bounding
scrambling
screaming
would
turn
and
run
toward
father
ocean
while
he
roared
louder
than
all
of
them
put
together
and
made
short
rushes
up
and
down
to
represent
the
movement
of
waves
on
a
beach
such
a
noise
as
this
beautiful
game
made
was
never
heard
in
the
town
of
burnet
before
or
since
it
was
like
the
bellowing
of
the
bulls
of
bashan
the
squeaking
of
pigs
the
cackle
of
and
the
laugh
of
wild
hyenas
all
at
once
and
in
addition
there
was
a
great
banging
of
furniture
and
scraping
of
many
feet
on
an
uncarpeted
floor
people
going
by
stopped
and
stared
children
cried
an
old
lady
asked
why
some
one
did
run
for
a
policeman
while
the
miller
girls
listened
to
the
proceedings
with
malicious
pleasure
and
told
everybody
that
it
was
the
noise
that
knight
scholars
usually
made
at
recess
knight
coming
back
from
dinner
was
much
amazed
to
see
a
crowd
of
people
collected
in
front
of
her
school
as
she
drew
near
the
sounds
reached
her
and
then
she
became
really
frightened
for
she
thought
somebody
was
being
murdered
on
her
premises
hurrying
in
she
threw
open
the
door
and
there
to
her
dismay
was
the
whole
room
in
a
frightful
state
of
confusion
and
uproar
chairs
flung
down
desks
upset
ink
streaming
on
the
floor
while
in
the
midst
of
the
ruin
the
frantic
rivers
raced
and
screamed
and
old
father
ocean
with
a
face
as
red
as
fire
capered
like
a
lunatic
on
the
platform
what
this
mean
gasped
poor
knight
almost
unable
to
speak
for
horror
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
the
rivers
stood
still
father
ocean
brought
his
prances
to
an
abrupt
close
and
slunk
down
from
the
platform
all
of
a
sudden
each
girl
seemed
to
realize
what
a
condition
the
room
was
in
and
what
a
horrible
thing
she
had
done
the
timid
ones
cowered
behind
their
desks
the
bold
ones
tried
to
look
unconscious
and
to
make
matters
worse
the
scholars
who
had
gone
home
to
dinner
began
to
return
staring
at
the
scene
of
disaster
and
asking
in
whispers
what
had
been
going
on
knight
rang
the
bell
when
the
school
had
come
to
order
she
had
the
desks
and
chairs
picked
up
while
she
herself
brought
wet
cloths
to
sop
the
ink
from
the
floor
this
was
done
in
profound
silence
and
the
expression
of
knight
face
was
so
direful
and
solemn
that
a
fresh
damp
fell
upon
the
spirits
of
the
guilty
rivers
and
father
ocean
wished
himself
thousands
of
miles
away
when
all
was
in
order
again
and
the
girls
had
taken
their
seats
knight
made
a
short
speech
she
said
she
never
was
so
shocked
in
her
life
before
she
had
supposed
that
she
could
trust
them
to
behave
like
ladies
when
her
back
was
turned
the
idea
that
they
could
act
so
disgracefully
make
such
an
uproar
and
alarm
people
going
by
had
never
occurred
to
her
and
she
was
deeply
pained
it
was
setting
a
bad
example
to
all
the
neighborhood
by
which
knight
meant
the
rival
school
miss
miller
having
just
sent
over
a
little
girl
with
her
compliments
to
ask
if
any
one
was
hurt
and
could
do
anything
which
was
naturally
aggravating
knight
hoped
they
were
sorry
she
thought
they
must
be
sorry
and
ashamed
the
exercises
could
now
go
on
as
usual
of
course
some
punishment
would
be
inflicted
for
the
offense
but
she
should
have
to
reflect
before
deciding
what
it
ought
to
be
meantime
she
wanted
them
all
to
think
it
over
seriously
and
if
any
one
felt
that
she
was
more
to
blame
than
the
others
now
was
the
moment
to
rise
and
confess
it
katy
heart
gave
a
great
thump
but
she
rose
bravely
i
made
up
the
game
and
i
was
father
ocean
she
said
to
the
astonished
knight
who
glared
at
her
for
a
minute
and
then
replied
solemnly
very
well
katy
sit
down
which
katy
did
feeling
more
ashamed
than
ever
but
somehow
relieved
in
her
mind
there
is
a
saving
grace
in
truth
which
helps
through
the
worst
of
their
troubles
and
katy
found
this
out
now
the
afternoon
was
long
and
hard
knight
did
not
smile
once
the
lessons
dragged
and
katy
after
the
heat
and
excitement
of
the
forenoon
began
to
feel
miserable
she
had
received
more
than
one
hard
blow
during
the
meetings
of
the
waters
and
had
bruised
herself
almost
without
knowing
it
against
the
desks
and
chairs
all
these
places
now
began
to
ache
her
head
throbbed
so
that
she
could
hardly
see
and
a
lump
of
something
heavy
seemed
to
be
lying
on
her
heart
when
school
was
over
knight
rose
and
said
the
young
ladies
who
took
part
in
the
game
this
afternoon
are
requested
to
remain
all
the
others
went
away
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
it
was
a
horrible
moment
the
girls
never
forgot
it
or
the
hopeless
sound
of
the
door
as
the
last
departing
scholar
clapped
it
after
her
as
she
left
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
what
it
was
that
knight
said
to
them
it
was
very
affecting
and
before
long
most
of
the
girls
began
to
cry
the
penalty
for
their
offense
was
announced
to
be
the
loss
of
recess
for
three
weeks
but
that
was
half
so
bad
as
seeing
knight
so
religious
and
afflicted
as
cecy
told
her
mother
afterward
one
by
one
the
sobbing
sinners
departed
from
the
schoolroom
when
most
of
them
were
gone
knight
called
katy
up
to
the
platform
and
said
a
few
words
to
her
specially
she
was
not
really
severe
but
katy
was
too
penitent
and
worn
out
to
bear
much
and
before
long
was
weeping
like
a
or
like
the
ocean
she
had
pretended
to
be
at
this
knight
was
so
much
affected
that
she
let
her
off
at
once
and
even
kissed
her
in
token
of
forgiveness
which
made
poor
ocean
sob
harder
than
ever
all
the
way
home
she
sobbed
faithful
little
clover
running
along
by
her
side
in
great
distress
begging
her
to
stop
crying
and
trying
in
vain
to
hold
up
the
fragments
of
her
dress
which
was
torn
in
at
least
a
dozen
places
katy
could
not
stop
crying
and
it
was
fortunate
that
aunt
izzie
happened
to
be
out
and
that
the
only
person
who
saw
her
in
this
piteous
plight
was
mary
the
nurse
who
doted
on
the
children
and
was
always
ready
to
help
them
out
of
their
troubles
on
this
occasion
she
petted
and
cosseted
katy
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
johnnie
or
little
phil
she
took
her
on
her
lap
bathed
the
hot
head
brushed
the
hair
put
arnica
on
the
bruises
and
produced
a
clean
frock
so
that
by
the
poor
child
except
for
her
red
eyes
looked
like
herself
again
and
aunt
izzie
did
notice
anything
unusual
for
a
wonder
carr
was
at
home
that
evening
it
was
always
a
great
treat
to
the
children
when
this
happened
and
katy
thought
herself
happy
when
after
the
little
ones
had
gone
to
bed
she
got
papa
to
herself
and
told
him
the
whole
story
papa
she
said
sitting
on
his
knee
which
big
girl
as
she
was
she
liked
very
much
to
do
what
is
the
reason
that
makes
some
days
so
lucky
and
other
days
so
unlucky
now
today
began
all
wrong
and
everything
that
happened
in
it
was
wrong
and
on
other
days
i
begin
right
and
all
goes
right
straight
through
if
aunt
izzie
had
kept
me
in
the
morning
i
should
have
lost
my
mark
and
then
i
should
have
been
cross
and
then
i
should
have
got
in
my
other
scrapes
but
what
made
aunt
izzie
keep
you
katy
to
sew
on
the
string
of
my
bonnet
papa
but
how
did
it
happen
that
the
string
was
off
well
said
katy
reluctantly
i
am
afraid
that
was
fault
for
it
came
off
on
tuesday
and
i
did
fasten
it
on
so
you
see
we
must
go
back
of
aunt
izzie
for
the
beginning
of
this
unlucky
day
of
yours
childie
did
you
ever
hear
the
old
saying
about
the
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost
no
never
tell
it
to
me
cried
katy
who
loved
stories
as
well
as
when
she
was
three
years
old
so
carr
repeated
for
the
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost
for
the
want
of
a
shoe
the
horse
was
lost
for
the
want
of
a
horse
the
rider
was
lost
for
the
want
of
a
rider
the
battle
was
lost
for
the
want
of
a
battle
the
kingdom
was
lost
and
all
for
want
of
a
nail
oh
papa
exclaimed
katy
giving
him
a
great
hug
as
she
got
off
his
knee
i
see
what
you
mean
who
would
have
thought
such
a
little
speck
of
a
thing
as
not
sewing
on
my
string
could
make
a
difference
but
i
do
believe
i
shall
get
in
any
more
scrapes
for
i
ever
forget
the
want
of
a
nail
the
shoe
was
lost
chapter
iv
kikeri
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
my
poor
thoughtless
katy
forget
and
did
get
into
another
scrape
and
that
no
later
than
the
very
next
monday
monday
was
apt
to
be
rather
a
stormy
day
at
the
carrs
there
was
the
big
wash
to
be
done
and
aunt
izzie
always
seemed
a
little
harder
to
please
and
the
servants
a
good
deal
crosser
than
on
common
days
but
i
think
it
was
also
in
part
the
fault
of
the
children
who
after
the
quiet
of
sunday
were
specially
frisky
and
uproarious
and
readier
than
usual
for
all
sorts
of
mischief
to
clover
and
elsie
sunday
seemed
to
begin
at
saturday
when
their
hair
was
wet
and
screwed
up
in
papers
that
it
might
curl
next
day
elsie
waved
naturally
so
aunt
izzie
did
think
it
necessary
to
pin
her
papers
very
tight
but
clover
thick
straight
locks
required
to
be
pinched
hard
before
they
would
give
even
the
least
twirl
and
to
her
saturday
night
was
one
of
misery
she
would
lie
tossing
and
turning
and
trying
first
one
side
of
her
head
and
then
the
other
but
whichever
way
she
placed
herself
the
hard
knobs
and
the
pins
stuck
out
and
hurt
her
so
when
at
last
she
fell
asleep
it
was
face
down
with
her
small
nose
buried
in
the
pillow
which
was
not
comfortable
and
gave
her
bad
dreams
in
consequence
of
these
sufferings
clover
hated
curls
and
when
she
made
up
stories
for
the
younger
children
they
always
commenced
the
hair
of
the
beautiful
princess
was
as
straight
as
a
and
she
never
did
it
up
in
papers
never
sunday
always
began
with
a
bible
story
followed
by
a
breakfast
of
baked
beans
which
two
things
were
much
tangled
up
together
in
philly
mind
after
breakfast
the
children
studied
their
lessons
and
then
the
big
carryall
came
round
and
they
drove
to
church
which
was
a
good
mile
off
it
was
a
large
church
with
galleries
and
long
pews
with
high
seats
the
choir
sat
at
the
end
behind
a
low
green
curtain
which
slipped
from
side
to
side
on
rods
when
the
sermon
began
they
would
draw
the
curtain
aside
and
show
themselves
all
ready
to
listen
but
the
rest
of
the
time
they
kept
it
shut
katy
always
guessed
that
they
must
be
having
good
times
behind
the
green
curtain
eating
perhaps
or
reading
the
books
and
she
often
wished
she
might
sit
up
there
among
them
the
seat
in
carr
pew
was
so
high
that
none
of
the
children
except
katy
could
touch
the
floor
even
with
the
point
of
a
toe
this
made
their
feet
go
to
sleep
and
when
they
felt
the
queer
little
which
drowsy
feet
use
to
rouse
themselves
with
they
would
slide
off
the
seat
and
sit
on
the
benches
to
get
over
it
once
there
and
well
hidden
from
view
it
was
almost
impossible
not
to
whisper
aunt
izzie
would
frown
and
shake
her
head
but
it
did
little
good
especially
as
phil
and
dorry
were
sleeping
with
their
heads
on
her
lap
and
it
took
both
her
hands
to
keep
them
from
rolling
off
into
the
bottom
of
the
pew
when
good
old
stone
said
finally
my
brethren
she
would
begin
waking
them
up
it
was
hard
work
sometimes
but
generally
she
succeeded
so
that
during
the
last
hymn
the
two
stood
together
on
the
seat
quite
brisk
and
refreshed
sharing
a
and
making
believe
to
sing
like
the
older
people
after
church
came
which
the
children
liked
very
much
and
then
they
went
home
to
dinner
which
was
always
the
same
on
sunday
cold
baked
potatoes
and
rice
pudding
they
did
not
go
to
church
in
the
afternoon
unless
they
wished
but
were
pounced
upon
by
katy
instead
and
forced
to
listen
to
the
reading
of
sunday
a
religious
paper
of
which
she
was
the
editor
this
paper
was
partly
written
partly
printed
on
a
large
sheet
of
foolscap
and
had
at
the
top
an
ornamental
device
in
lead
pencil
with
sunday
visitor
in
the
middle
of
it
the
reading
part
began
with
a
dull
little
piece
of
the
kind
which
grown
people
call
an
editorial
about
neatness
or
obedience
or
punctuality
the
children
always
fidgeted
when
listening
to
this
partly
i
think
because
it
aggravated
them
to
have
katy
recommending
on
paper
as
very
easy
the
virtues
which
she
herself
found
it
so
hard
to
practise
in
real
life
next
came
anecdotes
about
dogs
and
elephants
and
snakes
taken
from
the
natural
history
book
and
not
very
interesting
because
the
audience
knew
them
by
heart
already
a
hymn
or
two
followed
or
a
string
of
original
verses
and
last
of
all
a
chapter
of
little
maria
and
her
sisters
a
dreadful
tale
in
which
katy
drew
so
much
moral
and
made
such
personal
allusions
to
the
faults
of
the
rest
that
it
was
almost
more
than
they
could
bear
in
fact
there
had
just
been
a
nursery
rebellion
on
the
subject
you
must
know
that
for
some
weeks
back
katy
had
been
too
lazy
to
prepare
any
fresh
and
so
had
forced
the
children
to
sit
in
a
row
and
listen
to
the
back
numbers
which
she
read
aloud
from
the
very
beginning
little
maria
sounded
much
worse
when
taken
in
these
large
doses
and
clover
and
elsie
combining
for
once
made
up
their
minds
to
endure
it
no
longer
so
watching
their
chance
they
carried
off
the
whole
edition
and
poked
it
into
the
kitchen
fire
where
they
watched
it
burn
with
a
mixture
of
fear
and
delight
which
it
was
comical
to
witness
they
dared
not
confess
the
deed
but
it
was
impossible
not
to
look
conscious
when
katy
was
flying
about
and
rummaging
after
her
lost
treasure
and
she
suspected
them
and
was
very
irate
in
consequence
the
evenings
of
sunday
were
always
spent
in
repeating
hymns
to
papa
and
aunt
izzie
this
was
fun
for
they
all
took
turns
and
there
was
quite
a
scramble
as
to
who
should
secure
the
favorites
such
as
the
west
hath
shut
its
gate
of
gold
and
go
when
the
morning
shineth
on
the
whole
sunday
was
a
sweet
and
pleasant
day
and
the
children
thought
so
but
from
its
being
so
much
quieter
than
other
days
they
always
got
up
on
monday
full
of
life
and
mischief
and
ready
to
fizz
over
at
any
minute
like
champagne
bottles
with
the
wires
just
cut
this
particular
monday
was
rainy
so
there
could
be
any
play
which
was
the
usual
vent
for
spirits
the
little
ones
cooped
up
in
the
nursery
all
the
afternoon
had
grown
perfectly
riotous
philly
was
not
quite
well
and
had
been
taking
medicine
the
medicine
was
called
it
was
a
great
favorite
with
aunt
izzie
who
kept
a
bottle
of
it
always
on
hand
the
bottle
was
large
and
black
with
a
paper
label
tied
round
its
neck
and
the
children
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
it
after
phil
had
stopped
roaring
and
spluttering
and
play
had
begun
again
the
dolls
as
was
only
natural
were
taken
ill
also
and
so
was
pikery
john
little
yellow
chair
which
she
always
pretended
was
a
doll
too
she
kept
an
old
apron
tied
on
his
back
and
generally
took
him
to
bed
with
her
not
into
bed
that
would
have
been
troublesome
but
close
by
tied
to
the
now
as
she
told
the
others
pikery
was
very
sick
indeed
he
must
have
some
medicine
just
like
philly
give
him
some
water
suggested
dorry
no
said
john
decidedly
it
must
be
black
and
out
of
a
bottle
or
it
wo
do
any
good
after
thinking
a
moment
she
trotted
quietly
across
the
passage
into
aunt
izzie
room
nobody
was
there
but
john
knew
where
the
elixir
pro
was
kept
in
the
closet
on
the
third
shelf
she
pulled
one
of
the
drawers
out
a
little
climbed
up
and
reached
it
down
the
children
were
enchanted
when
she
marched
back
the
bottle
in
one
hand
the
cork
in
the
other
and
proceeded
to
pour
a
liberal
dose
on
to
pikery
wooden
seat
which
john
called
his
lap
there
there
my
poor
boy
she
said
patting
his
shoulder
i
mean
his
arm
swallow
it
down
it
do
you
good
just
then
aunt
izzie
came
in
and
to
her
dismay
saw
a
long
trickle
of
something
dark
and
sticky
running
down
on
to
the
carpet
it
was
medicine
which
he
had
refused
to
swallow
what
is
that
she
asked
sharply
my
baby
is
sick
faltered
john
displaying
the
guilty
bottle
aunt
izzie
rapped
her
over
the
head
with
a
thimble
and
told
her
that
she
was
a
very
naughty
child
whereupon
johnnie
pouted
and
cried
a
little
aunt
izzie
wiped
up
the
slop
and
taking
away
the
elixir
retired
with
it
to
her
closet
saying
that
she
never
knew
anything
like
it
it
was
always
so
on
mondays
what
further
pranks
were
played
in
the
nursery
that
day
i
can
not
pretend
to
tell
but
late
in
the
afternoon
a
dreadful
screaming
was
heard
and
when
people
rushed
from
all
parts
of
the
house
to
see
what
was
the
matter
behold
the
nursery
door
was
locked
and
nobody
could
get
in
aunt
izzie
called
through
the
keyhole
to
have
it
opened
but
the
roars
were
so
loud
that
it
was
long
before
she
could
get
an
answer
at
last
elsie
sobbing
violently
explained
that
dorry
had
locked
the
door
and
now
the
key
would
turn
and
they
could
open
it
they
have
to
stay
there
always
and
starve
of
course
you
wo
you
foolish
child
exclaimed
aunt
izzie
dear
dear
what
on
earth
will
come
next
stop
crying
elsie
do
you
hear
me
you
shall
all
be
got
out
in
a
few
minutes
and
sure
enough
the
next
thing
came
a
rattling
at
the
blinds
and
there
was
alexander
the
hired
man
standing
outside
on
a
tall
ladder
and
nodding
his
head
at
the
children
the
little
ones
forgot
their
fright
they
flew
to
open
the
window
and
frisked
and
jumped
about
alexander
as
he
climbed
in
and
unlocked
the
door
it
struck
them
as
being
such
a
fine
thing
to
be
let
out
in
this
way
that
dorry
began
to
rather
plume
himself
for
fastening
them
in
but
aunt
izzie
did
take
this
view
of
the
case
she
scolded
them
well
and
declared
they
were
troublesome
children
who
could
be
trusted
one
moment
out
of
sight
and
that
she
was
more
than
half
sorry
she
had
promised
to
go
to
the
lecture
that
evening
how
do
i
know
she
concluded
that
before
i
come
home
you
wo
have
set
the
house
on
fire
or
killed
somebody
oh
no
we
wo
no
we
wo
whined
the
children
quite
moved
by
this
frightful
picture
but
bless
you
ten
minutes
afterward
they
had
forgotten
all
about
it
all
this
time
katy
had
been
sitting
on
the
ledge
of
the
bookcase
in
the
library
poring
over
a
book
it
was
called
tasso
jerusalem
delivered
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
an
italian
but
somebody
had
done
the
story
over
into
english
it
was
rather
a
queer
book
for
a
little
girl
to
take
a
fancy
to
but
somehow
katy
liked
it
very
much
it
told
about
knights
and
ladies
and
giants
and
battles
and
made
her
feel
hot
and
cold
by
turns
as
she
read
and
as
if
she
must
rush
at
something
and
shout
and
strike
blows
katy
was
naturally
fond
of
reading
papa
encouraged
it
he
kept
a
few
books
locked
up
and
then
turned
her
loose
in
the
library
she
read
all
sorts
of
things
travels
and
sermons
and
old
magazines
nothing
was
so
dull
that
she
could
get
through
with
it
anything
really
interesting
absorbed
her
so
that
she
never
knew
what
was
going
on
about
her
the
little
girls
to
whose
houses
she
went
visiting
had
found
this
out
and
always
hid
away
their
when
she
was
expected
to
tea
if
they
did
do
this
she
was
sure
to
pick
one
up
and
plunge
in
and
then
it
was
no
use
to
call
her
or
tug
at
her
dress
for
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
more
till
it
was
time
to
go
home
this
afternoon
she
read
the
jerusalem
till
it
was
too
dark
to
see
any
more
on
her
way
up
stairs
she
met
aunt
izzie
with
bonnet
and
shawl
on
where
you
been
she
said
i
have
been
calling
you
for
the
last
i
did
hear
you
but
where
were
you
persisted
miss
izzie
in
the
library
reading
replied
katy
her
aunt
gave
a
sort
of
sniff
but
she
knew
katy
ways
and
said
no
more
i
going
out
to
drink
tea
with
hall
and
attend
the
evening
lecture
she
went
on
be
sure
that
clover
gets
her
lesson
and
if
cecy
comes
over
as
usual
you
must
send
her
home
early
all
of
you
must
be
in
bed
by
nine
yes
said
katy
but
i
fear
she
was
not
attending
much
but
thinking
in
her
secret
soul
how
jolly
it
was
to
have
aunt
izzie
go
out
for
once
miss
carr
was
very
faithful
to
her
duties
she
seldom
left
the
children
even
for
an
evening
so
whenever
she
did
they
felt
a
certain
sense
of
novelty
and
freedom
which
was
dangerous
as
well
as
pleasant
still
i
am
sure
that
on
this
occasion
katy
meant
no
mischief
like
all
excitable
people
she
seldom
did
to
do
wrong
she
just
did
it
when
it
came
into
her
head
supper
passed
off
successfully
and
all
might
have
gone
well
had
it
not
been
that
after
the
lessons
were
learned
and
cecy
had
come
in
they
fell
to
talking
about
kikeri
kikeri
was
a
game
which
had
been
very
popular
with
them
a
year
before
they
had
invented
it
themselves
and
chosen
for
it
this
queer
name
out
of
an
old
fairy
story
it
was
a
sort
of
mixture
of
blindman
buff
and
tag
only
instead
of
any
one
eyes
being
bandaged
they
all
played
in
the
dark
one
of
the
children
would
stay
out
in
the
hall
which
was
dimly
lighted
from
the
stairs
while
the
others
hid
themselves
in
the
nursery
when
they
were
all
hidden
they
would
call
out
kikeri
as
a
signal
for
the
one
in
the
hall
to
come
in
and
find
them
of
course
coming
from
the
light
he
could
see
nothing
while
the
others
could
see
only
dimly
it
was
very
exciting
to
stand
crouching
up
in
a
corner
and
watch
the
dark
figure
stumbling
about
and
feeling
to
right
and
left
while
every
now
and
then
somebody
just
escaping
his
clutches
would
slip
past
and
gain
the
hall
which
was
freedom
castle
with
a
joyful
shout
of
kikeri
kikeri
kikeri
ki
whoever
was
caught
had
to
take
the
place
of
the
catcher
for
a
long
time
this
game
was
the
delight
of
the
carr
children
but
so
many
scratches
and
spots
came
of
it
and
so
many
of
the
nursery
things
were
thrown
down
and
broken
that
at
last
aunt
izzie
issued
an
order
that
it
should
not
be
played
any
more
this
was
almost
a
year
since
but
talking
of
it
now
put
it
into
their
heads
to
want
to
try
it
again
after
all
we
did
promise
said
cecy
no
and
never
said
a
word
about
our
not
playing
it
added
katy
to
whom
papa
was
authority
and
must
always
be
minded
while
aunt
izzie
might
now
and
then
be
defied
so
they
all
went
up
stairs
dorry
and
john
though
half
undressed
were
allowed
to
join
the
game
philly
was
fast
asleep
in
another
room
it
was
certainly
splendid
fun
once
clover
climbed
up
on
the
and
sat
there
and
when
katy
who
was
finder
groped
about
a
little
more
wildly
than
usual
she
caught
hold
of
clover
foot
and
could
imagine
where
it
came
from
dorry
got
a
hard
knock
and
cried
and
at
another
time
katy
dress
caught
on
the
bureau
handle
and
was
frightfully
torn
but
these
were
too
much
affairs
of
every
day
to
interfere
in
the
least
with
the
pleasures
of
kikeri
the
fun
and
frolic
seemed
to
grow
greater
the
longer
they
played
in
the
excitement
time
went
on
much
faster
than
any
of
them
dreamed
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
noise
came
a
sound
the
sharp
distinct
slam
of
the
at
the
side
entrance
aunt
izzie
had
returned
from
her
lecture
the
dismay
and
confusion
of
that
moment
cecy
slipped
down
stairs
like
an
eel
and
fled
on
the
wings
of
fear
along
the
path
which
led
to
her
home
hall
as
she
bade
aunt
izzie
and
shut
front
door
behind
her
with
a
bang
might
have
been
struck
with
the
singular
fact
that
a
distant
bang
came
from
her
own
front
door
like
a
sort
of
echo
but
she
was
not
a
suspicious
woman
and
when
she
went
up
stairs
there
were
cecy
clothes
neatly
folded
on
a
chair
and
cecy
herself
in
bed
fast
asleep
only
with
a
little
more
color
than
usual
in
her
cheeks
meantime
aunt
izzie
was
on
way
up
stairs
and
such
a
panic
as
prevailed
in
the
nursery
katie
felt
it
and
basely
scuttled
off
to
her
own
room
where
she
went
to
bed
with
all
possible
speed
but
the
others
found
it
much
harder
to
go
to
bed
there
were
so
many
of
them
all
getting
into
each
other
way
and
with
no
lamp
to
see
by
dorry
and
john
popped
under
the
clothes
half
undressed
elsie
disappeared
and
clover
too
late
for
either
and
hearing
aunt
izzie
step
in
the
hall
did
this
horrible
thing
fell
on
her
knees
with
her
face
buried
in
a
chair
and
began
to
say
her
prayers
very
hard
indeed
aunt
izzie
coming
in
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
stood
in
the
doorway
astonished
at
the
spectacle
she
sat
down
and
waited
for
clover
to
get
through
while
clover
on
her
part
did
dare
to
get
through
but
went
on
repeating
now
i
lay
me
over
and
over
again
in
a
sort
of
despair
at
last
aunt
izzie
said
very
grimly
that
will
do
clover
you
can
get
up
and
clover
rose
feeling
like
a
culprit
which
she
was
for
it
was
much
naughtier
to
pretend
to
be
praying
than
to
disobey
aunt
izzie
and
be
out
of
bed
after
ten
though
i
think
clover
hardly
understood
this
then
aunt
izzie
at
once
began
to
undress
her
and
while
doing
so
asked
so
many
questions
that
before
long
she
had
got
at
the
truth
of
the
whole
matter
she
gave
clover
a
sharp
scolding
and
leaving
her
to
wash
her
tearful
face
she
went
to
the
bed
where
john
and
dorry
lay
fast
asleep
and
snoring
as
conspicuously
as
they
knew
how
something
strange
in
the
appearance
of
the
bed
made
her
look
more
closely
she
lifted
the
clothes
and
there
sure
enough
they
were
half
dressed
and
with
their
on
such
a
shake
as
aunt
izzie
gave
the
little
scamps
at
this
discovery
would
have
roused
a
couple
of
dormice
much
against
their
will
john
and
dorry
were
forced
to
wake
up
and
be
slapped
and
scolded
and
made
ready
for
bed
aunt
izzie
standing
over
them
all
the
while
like
a
dragon
she
had
just
tucked
them
warmly
in
when
for
the
first
time
she
missed
elsie
where
is
my
poor
little
elsie
she
exclaimed
in
bed
said
clover
meekly
in
bed
repeated
aunt
izzie
much
amazed
then
stooping
down
she
gave
a
vigorous
pull
the
came
into
view
and
sure
enough
there
was
elsie
in
full
dress
shoes
and
all
but
so
fast
asleep
that
not
all
aunt
izzie
shakes
and
pinches
and
calls
were
able
to
rouse
her
her
clothes
were
taken
off
her
boots
unlaced
her
put
on
but
through
it
all
elsie
slept
and
she
was
the
only
one
of
the
children
who
did
not
get
the
scolding
she
deserved
that
dreadful
night
katy
did
not
even
pretend
to
be
asleep
when
aunt
izzie
went
to
her
room
her
tardy
conscience
had
waked
up
and
she
was
lying
in
bed
very
miserable
at
having
drawn
the
others
into
a
scrape
as
well
as
herself
and
at
the
failure
of
her
last
set
of
resolutions
about
setting
an
example
to
the
younger
ones
so
unhappy
was
she
that
aunt
izzie
severe
words
were
almost
a
relief
and
though
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
it
was
rather
from
the
burden
of
her
own
thoughts
than
because
she
had
been
scolded
she
cried
even
harder
the
next
day
for
carr
talked
to
her
more
seriously
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
reminded
her
of
the
time
when
her
mamma
died
and
of
how
she
said
katy
must
be
a
mamma
to
the
little
ones
when
she
grows
up
and
he
asked
her
if
she
did
think
the
time
was
come
for
beginning
to
take
this
dear
place
towards
the
children
poor
katy
she
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
at
this
and
though
she
made
no
promises
i
think
she
was
never
quite
so
thoughtless
again
after
that
day
as
for
the
rest
papa
called
them
together
and
made
them
distinctly
understand
that
kikeri
was
never
to
be
played
any
more
it
was
so
seldom
that
papa
forbade
any
games
however
boisterous
that
this
order
really
made
an
impression
on
the
unruly
brood
and
they
never
have
played
kikeri
again
from
that
day
to
this
chapter
v
in
the
loft
i
declare
said
miss
petingill
laying
down
her
work
if
them
children
do
beat
all
what
on
airth
they
going
to
do
now
miss
petingill
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
in
the
back
building
which
she
always
had
when
she
came
to
the
carr
for
a
week
mending
and
making
over
she
was
the
dearest
funniest
old
woman
who
ever
went
out
sewing
by
the
day
her
face
was
round
and
somehow
made
you
think
of
a
very
nice
baked
apple
it
was
so
and
lined
by
a
thousand
puckers
she
was
small
and
wiry
and
wore
caps
and
a
false
front
which
was
just
the
color
of
a
dusty
newfoundland
back
her
eyes
were
dim
and
she
used
spectacles
but
for
all
that
she
was
an
excellent
worker
every
one
liked
miss
petingill
though
aunt
izzie
once
say
that
her
tongue
was
hung
in
the
middle
aunt
izzie
made
this
remark
when
she
was
in
a
temper
and
was
by
no
means
prepared
to
have
phil
walk
up
at
once
and
request
miss
petingill
to
stick
it
out
which
she
obligingly
did
while
the
rest
of
the
children
crowded
to
look
they
could
see
that
it
was
different
from
other
tongues
but
philly
persisted
in
finding
something
curious
about
it
there
must
be
you
know
since
it
was
hung
in
that
queer
way
wherever
miss
petingill
went
all
sorts
of
treasures
went
with
her
the
children
liked
to
have
her
come
for
it
was
as
good
as
a
fairy
story
or
the
circus
to
see
her
things
unpacked
miss
petingill
was
very
much
afraid
of
burglars
she
lay
awake
half
the
night
listening
for
them
and
nothing
on
earth
would
have
persuaded
her
to
go
anywhere
leaving
behind
what
she
called
her
plate
this
stately
word
meant
six
old
teaspoons
very
thin
and
bright
and
sharp
and
a
whose
handle
set
forth
that
it
was
a
testimonial
of
gratitude
for
saving
the
life
of
ithuriel
jobson
aged
seven
on
the
occasion
of
his
being
attacked
with
quinsy
sore
throat
miss
petingill
was
very
proud
of
her
knife
it
and
the
spoons
travelled
about
in
a
little
basket
which
hung
on
her
arm
and
was
never
allowed
to
be
out
of
her
sight
even
when
the
family
she
was
sewing
for
were
the
honestest
people
in
the
world
then
beside
the
miss
petingill
never
stirred
without
tom
her
tortoiseshell
cat
tom
was
a
beauty
and
knew
his
power
he
ruled
miss
petingill
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
always
sat
in
the
when
there
was
one
it
was
no
matter
where
sat
miss
petingill
told
people
but
tom
was
delicate
and
must
be
made
comfortable
a
big
family
bible
always
came
too
and
a
special
red
merino
and
some
shade
pictures
of
old
and
petingill
and
peter
petingill
who
was
drowned
at
sea
and
photographs
of
porter
who
used
to
be
marcia
petingill
and
porter
husband
and
all
the
porter
children
many
little
boxes
and
jars
came
also
and
a
long
row
of
phials
and
bottles
filled
with
homemade
physic
and
herb
teas
miss
petingill
could
not
have
slept
without
having
them
beside
her
for
as
she
said
how
did
she
know
that
she
might
not
be
took
sudden
with
something
and
die
for
want
of
a
little
or
pennyroyal
the
carr
children
always
made
so
much
noise
that
it
required
something
unusual
to
make
miss
petingill
drop
her
work
as
she
did
now
and
fly
to
the
window
in
fact
there
was
a
tremendous
hubbub
hurrahs
from
dorry
stamping
of
feet
and
a
great
outcry
of
shrill
glad
voices
looking
down
miss
petingill
saw
the
whole
six
no
seven
for
cecy
was
there
too
stream
out
of
the
door
which
was
a
door
but
only
a
tall
open
arch
and
rush
noisily
across
the
yard
katy
was
at
the
head
bearing
a
large
black
bottle
without
any
cork
in
it
while
the
others
carried
in
each
hand
what
seemed
to
be
a
cookie
katherine
carr
screamed
miss
petingill
tapping
loudly
on
the
glass
do
you
see
that
it
raining
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
let
your
little
brothers
and
sisters
go
out
and
get
wet
in
such
a
way
but
nobody
heard
her
and
the
children
vanished
into
the
shed
where
nothing
could
be
seen
but
a
distant
flapping
of
pantalettes
and
frilled
trousers
going
up
what
seemed
to
be
a
ladder
farther
back
in
the
shed
so
with
a
dissatisfied
cluck
miss
petingill
drew
back
her
head
perched
the
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
went
to
work
again
on
katy
plaid
alpaca
which
had
two
immense
zigzag
rents
across
the
middle
of
the
front
breadth
katy
frocks
strange
to
say
always
tore
exactly
in
that
place
if
miss
petingill
eyes
could
have
reached
a
little
farther
they
would
have
seen
that
it
was
a
ladder
up
which
the
children
were
climbing
but
a
tall
wooden
post
with
spikes
driven
into
it
about
a
foot
apart
it
required
quite
a
stride
to
get
from
one
spike
to
the
other
in
fact
the
littler
ones
could
have
managed
it
at
all
had
it
not
been
for
clover
and
cecy
boosting
very
hard
from
below
while
katy
making
a
long
arm
clawed
from
above
at
last
they
were
all
safely
up
and
in
the
delightful
retreat
which
i
am
about
to
describe
imagine
a
low
dark
loft
without
any
windows
and
with
only
a
very
little
light
coming
in
through
the
square
hole
in
the
floor
to
which
the
spikey
post
led
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
though
the
corn
had
been
taken
away
a
great
deal
of
dust
and
spiderweb
in
the
corners
and
some
wet
spots
on
the
boards
for
the
roof
always
leaked
a
little
in
rainy
weather
this
was
the
place
which
for
some
reason
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
the
carr
children
preferred
to
any
other
on
rainy
saturdays
when
they
could
not
play
aunt
izzie
was
as
much
puzzled
at
this
fancy
as
i
am
when
she
was
young
a
vague
time
which
none
of
her
nieces
and
nephews
believed
in
much
she
had
never
had
any
of
these
queer
notions
about
getting
off
into
holes
and
corners
and
places
aunt
izzie
would
gladly
have
forbidden
them
to
go
the
loft
but
carr
had
given
his
permission
so
all
she
could
do
was
to
invent
stories
about
children
who
had
broken
their
bones
in
various
dreadful
ways
by
climbing
posts
and
ladders
but
these
stories
made
no
impression
on
any
of
the
children
except
little
phil
and
the
brood
kept
on
their
way
and
climbed
their
spiked
post
as
often
as
they
liked
what
in
the
bottle
demanded
dorry
the
minute
he
was
fairly
landed
in
the
loft
do
be
greedy
replied
katy
severely
you
will
know
when
the
time
comes
it
is
something
i
can
assure
you
now
she
went
on
having
thus
quenched
dorry
all
of
you
had
better
give
me
your
cookies
to
put
away
if
you
do
they
be
sure
to
be
eaten
up
before
the
feast
and
then
you
know
there
would
be
anything
to
make
a
feast
of
so
all
of
them
handed
over
their
cookies
dorry
who
had
begun
on
his
as
he
came
up
the
ladder
was
a
little
unwilling
but
he
was
too
much
in
the
habit
of
minding
katy
to
dare
to
disobey
the
big
bottle
was
set
in
a
corner
and
a
stack
of
cookies
built
up
around
it
that
right
proceeded
katy
who
as
oldest
and
biggest
always
took
the
lead
in
their
plays
now
if
we
fixed
and
ready
to
begin
the
fête
katy
pronounced
it
can
commence
the
opening
exercise
will
be
tragedy
of
the
alhambra
by
miss
hall
no
cried
clover
first
blue
wizard
or
edwitha
of
the
hebrides
you
know
katy
did
i
tell
you
said
katy
a
dreadful
accident
has
happened
to
that
oh
what
cried
all
the
rest
for
edwitha
was
rather
a
favorite
with
the
family
it
was
one
of
the
many
serial
stories
which
katy
was
forever
writing
and
was
about
a
lady
a
knight
a
blue
wizard
and
a
poodle
named
bop
it
had
been
going
on
so
many
months
now
that
everybody
had
forgotten
the
beginning
and
nobody
had
any
particular
hope
of
living
to
hear
the
end
but
still
the
news
of
its
untimely
fate
was
a
shock
i
tell
you
said
katy
old
judge
kirby
called
this
morning
to
see
aunt
izzie
i
was
studying
in
the
little
room
but
i
saw
him
come
in
and
pull
out
the
big
chair
and
sit
down
and
i
almost
screamed
out
why
cried
the
children
do
you
see
i
had
stuffed
down
between
the
back
and
the
seat
it
was
a
for
the
seat
goes
back
ever
so
far
but
edwitha
was
such
a
fat
bundle
and
old
judge
kirby
takes
up
so
much
room
that
i
was
afraid
there
would
be
trouble
and
sure
enough
he
had
hardly
dropped
down
before
there
was
a
great
crackling
of
paper
and
he
jumped
up
again
and
called
out
me
what
is
that
and
then
he
began
poking
and
poking
and
just
as
he
had
poked
out
the
whole
bundle
and
was
putting
on
his
spectacles
to
see
what
it
was
aunt
izzie
came
in
well
what
next
cried
the
children
immensely
tickled
oh
continued
katy
aunt
izzie
put
on
her
glasses
too
and
screwed
up
her
eyes
you
know
the
way
she
does
and
she
and
the
judge
read
a
little
bit
of
it
that
part
at
the
first
you
remember
where
bop
steals
the
and
the
wizard
tries
to
throw
him
into
the
sea
you
think
how
funny
it
was
to
hear
aunt
izzie
reading
out
loud
and
katy
went
into
convulsions
at
the
recollection
where
she
got
to
bop
my
angel
bop
i
just
rolled
under
the
table
and
stuffed
the
in
my
mouth
to
keep
from
screaming
right
out
by
and
by
i
heard
her
call
debby
and
give
her
the
papers
and
say
is
a
mass
of
trash
which
i
wish
you
to
put
at
once
into
the
kitchen
fire
and
she
told
me
afterward
that
she
thought
i
would
be
in
an
insane
asylum
before
i
was
twenty
it
was
too
bad
ended
katy
half
laughing
and
half
crying
to
burn
up
the
new
chapter
and
all
but
there
one
good
thing
she
did
find
fairy
of
the
dry
goods
box
that
was
stuffed
farther
back
in
the
seat
and
now
continued
the
mistress
of
ceremonies
we
will
begin
miss
hall
will
please
rise
miss
hall
much
flustered
at
her
fine
name
got
up
with
very
red
cheeks
it
was
once
upon
a
time
she
read
moonlight
lay
on
the
halls
of
the
alhambra
and
the
knight
striding
impatiently
down
the
passage
thought
she
would
never
come
who
the
moon
asked
clover
no
of
course
not
replied
cecy
a
lady
he
was
in
love
with
the
next
verse
is
going
to
tell
about
her
only
you
interrupted
she
wore
a
turban
of
silver
with
a
jewelled
crescent
as
she
stole
down
the
corregidor
the
beams
struck
it
and
it
glittered
like
stars
you
are
come
zuleika
my
lord
just
then
a
sound
as
of
steel
smote
upon
the
ear
and
father
rushed
in
he
drew
his
sword
so
did
the
other
a
moment
more
and
they
both
lay
dead
and
stiff
in
the
beams
of
the
moon
zuleika
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
threw
herself
upon
their
bodies
she
was
dead
too
and
so
ends
the
tragedy
of
the
alhambra
that
lovely
said
katy
drawing
a
long
breath
only
very
sad
what
beautiful
stories
you
do
write
cecy
but
i
wish
you
would
always
kill
the
people
why
could
the
knight
have
killed
the
father
and
no
i
suppose
zuleika
would
have
married
him
then
well
the
father
might
have
oh
bother
why
must
anybody
be
killed
anyhow
why
not
have
them
fall
on
each
other
necks
and
make
up
why
katy
cried
cecy
it
would
have
been
a
tragedy
then
you
know
the
name
was
a
of
the
alhambra
oh
well
said
katy
hurriedly
for
cecy
lips
were
beginning
to
pout
and
her
fair
pinkish
face
to
redden
as
if
she
were
about
to
cry
perhaps
it
prettier
to
have
them
all
die
only
i
thought
for
a
change
you
know
what
a
lovely
word
that
was
what
does
it
mean
i
do
know
replied
cecy
quite
consoled
it
was
in
the
of
granada
something
to
walk
over
i
believe
the
next
went
on
katy
consulting
her
paper
is
a
simple
poem
by
clover
carr
all
the
children
giggled
but
clover
got
up
composedly
and
recited
the
following
verses
did
you
ever
know
yap
the
best
little
dog
who
sat
on
lap
or
barked
at
a
frog
his
eyes
were
like
beads
his
tail
like
a
mop
and
it
waggled
as
if
it
never
would
stop
his
hair
was
like
silk
of
the
glossiest
sheen
he
always
ate
milk
and
once
the
off
the
nursery
bureau
that
line
is
too
long
it
made
him
quite
ill
so
endeth
my
song
for
yappy
he
died
just
two
months
ago
and
we
ought
to
sing
at
a
funeral
you
know
the
poem
met
with
immense
applause
all
the
children
laughed
and
shouted
and
clapped
till
the
loft
rang
again
but
clover
kept
her
face
perfectly
and
sat
down
as
demure
as
ever
except
that
the
little
dimples
came
and
went
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
dimples
partly
natural
and
partly
i
regret
to
say
the
result
of
a
pointed
with
which
clover
was
in
the
habit
of
deepening
them
every
day
while
she
studied
her
lessons
now
said
katy
after
the
noise
had
subsided
now
come
verses
by
miss
elsie
and
joanna
carr
hold
up
your
head
elsie
and
speak
distinctly
and
oh
johnnie
you
giggle
in
that
way
when
it
comes
your
turn
but
johnnie
only
giggled
the
harder
at
this
appeal
keeping
her
hands
very
tight
across
her
mouth
and
peeping
out
over
her
fingers
elsie
however
was
solemn
as
a
little
judge
and
with
great
dignity
began
an
angel
with
a
fiery
sword
came
to
send
adam
and
eve
abroad
and
as
they
journeyed
through
the
skies
they
took
one
look
at
paradise
they
thought
of
all
the
happy
hours
among
the
birds
and
fragrant
bowers
and
eve
she
wept
and
adam
bawled
and
both
together
loudly
squalled
dorry
snickered
at
this
but
sedate
clover
hushed
him
you
must
she
said
it
about
the
bible
you
know
now
john
your
turn
but
johnnie
would
persist
in
holding
her
hands
over
her
mouth
while
her
fat
little
shoulders
shook
with
laughter
at
last
with
a
great
effort
she
pulled
her
face
straight
and
speaking
as
fast
as
she
possibly
could
repeated
in
a
sort
of
burst
balaam
donkey
saw
the
angel
and
stopped
short
in
fear
balaam
did
see
the
angel
which
is
very
queer
after
which
she
took
refuge
again
behind
her
fingers
while
elsie
went
on
elijah
by
the
creek
he
by
ravens
fed
took
from
their
horny
beak
pieces
of
meat
and
bread
come
johnnie
said
katy
but
the
incorrigible
johnnie
was
shaking
again
and
all
they
could
make
out
was
the
bears
came
down
and
ate
and
ate
these
verses
were
part
of
a
grand
project
on
which
clover
and
elsie
had
been
busy
for
more
than
a
year
it
was
a
sort
of
rearrangement
of
scripture
for
infant
minds
and
when
it
was
finished
they
meant
to
have
it
published
bound
in
red
with
daguerreotypes
of
the
two
authoresses
on
the
cover
the
youth
poetical
bible
was
to
be
the
name
of
it
papa
much
tickled
with
the
scraps
which
he
overheard
proposed
instead
the
book
as
having
been
composed
principally
in
that
spot
but
elsie
and
clover
were
highly
indignant
and
would
not
listen
to
the
idea
for
a
moment
after
the
scripture
verses
came
dorry
turn
he
had
been
allowed
to
choose
for
himself
which
was
unlucky
as
his
taste
was
peculiar
not
to
say
gloomy
on
this
occasion
he
had
selected
that
cheerful
hymn
which
begins
hark
from
the
tombs
a
doleful
sound
and
he
now
began
to
recite
it
in
a
lugubrious
voice
and
with
great
emphasis
smacking
his
lips
as
it
were
over
such
lines
as
princes
this
clay
be
your
bed
in
spite
of
all
your
towers
the
older
children
listened
with
a
sort
of
fascinated
horror
rather
enjoying
the
cold
chills
which
ran
down
their
backs
and
huddling
close
together
as
dorry
hollow
tones
echoed
from
the
dark
corners
of
the
loft
it
was
too
much
for
philly
however
at
the
close
of
the
piece
he
was
found
to
be
in
tears
i
do
want
to
up
here
and
be
groaned
at
he
sobbed
there
you
bad
boy
cried
katy
all
the
more
angry
because
she
was
conscious
of
having
enjoyed
it
herself
that
what
you
do
with
your
horrid
hymns
frightening
us
to
death
and
making
phil
cry
and
she
gave
dorry
a
little
shake
he
began
to
whimper
and
as
phil
was
still
sobbing
and
johnnie
had
begun
to
sob
too
out
of
sympathy
with
the
others
the
in
the
loft
seemed
likely
to
come
to
a
sad
end
i
goin
to
tell
aunt
izzie
that
i
do
like
you
declared
dorry
putting
one
leg
through
the
opening
in
the
floor
no
you
are
said
katy
seizing
him
you
are
going
to
stay
because
we
are
going
to
have
the
feast
do
stop
phil
and
johnnie
do
be
a
goose
but
come
and
pass
round
the
cookies
the
word
feast
produced
a
speedy
effect
on
the
spirits
of
the
party
phil
cheered
at
once
and
dorry
changed
his
mind
about
going
the
black
bottle
was
solemnly
set
in
the
midst
and
the
cookies
were
handed
about
by
johnnie
who
was
now
all
smiles
the
cookies
had
scalloped
edges
and
caraway
seeds
inside
and
were
very
nice
there
were
two
apiece
and
as
the
last
was
finished
katy
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
amid
great
applause
produced
the
crowning
addition
to
the
repast
seven
long
brown
sticks
of
cinnamon
is
it
fun
she
said
debby
was
real
and
let
me
put
my
own
hand
into
the
box
so
i
picked
out
the
longest
sticks
there
were
now
cecy
as
you
company
you
shall
have
the
first
drink
out
of
the
bottle
the
something
delicious
proved
to
be
weak
it
was
quite
warm
but
somehow
drank
up
there
in
the
loft
and
out
of
a
bottle
it
tasted
very
nice
beside
they
did
it
of
course
not
each
child
gave
his
or
her
swallow
a
different
name
as
if
the
bottle
were
like
signor
blitz
and
could
pour
out
a
dozen
things
at
once
clover
called
her
share
raspberry
shrub
dorry
christened
his
ginger
pop
while
cecy
who
was
romantic
took
her
three
sips
under
the
name
of
hydomel
which
she
explained
was
something
nice
made
she
believed
of
beeswax
the
last
drop
gone
and
the
last
bit
of
cinnamon
crunched
the
company
came
to
order
again
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
philly
repeat
his
one
piece
little
drops
of
water
which
exciting
poem
he
had
said
every
saturday
as
far
back
as
they
could
remember
after
that
katy
declared
the
literary
part
of
the
feet
over
and
they
all
fell
to
playing
stagecoach
which
in
spite
of
close
quarters
and
an
occasional
bump
from
the
roof
was
such
good
fun
that
a
general
oh
dear
welcomed
the
ringing
of
the
i
suppose
cookies
and
vinegar
had
taken
away
their
appetites
for
none
of
them
were
hungry
and
dorry
astonished
aunt
izzie
very
much
by
eyeing
the
table
in
a
disgusted
way
and
saying
pshaw
plum
sweatmeats
and
sponge
cake
and
hot
biscuit
i
do
want
any
supper
what
ails
the
child

loft

in
to
ask
you
and
she
standing
at
the
gate
at
this
moment
waiting
to
hear
what
you
say
please
let
me
just
this
once
i
shall
be
so
dreadfully
ashamed
not
to
well
said
miss
izzie
moved
by
the
wretchedness
of
katy
face
if
you
asked
her
already
it
no
use
my
saying
no
i
suppose
but
recollect
katy
this
is
not
to
happen
again
i
ca
have
you
inviting
girls
and
then
coming
for
my
leave
your
father
wo
be
at
all
pleased
he
very
particular
about
whom
you
make
friends
with
remember
how
spenser
turned
out
poor
katy
her
propensity
to
fall
violently
in
love
with
new
people
was
always
getting
her
into
scrapes
ever
since
she
began
to
walk
and
talk
katy
intimate
friends
had
been
one
of
the
jokes
of
the
household
papa
once
undertook
to
keep
a
list
of
them
but
the
number
grew
so
great
that
he
gave
it
up
in
despair
first
on
the
list
was
a
small
irish
child
named
marianne
marianne
lived
in
a
street
which
katy
passed
on
her
way
to
school
it
was
not
knight
but
an
abc
school
to
which
dorry
and
john
now
went
marianne
used
to
be
always
making
in
front
of
her
mother
house
and
katy
who
was
about
five
years
old
often
stopped
to
help
her
over
this
mutual
pastry
they
grew
so
intimate
that
katy
resolved
to
adopt
marianne
as
her
own
little
girl
and
bring
her
up
in
a
safe
and
hidden
corner
she
told
clover
of
this
plan
but
nobody
else
the
two
children
full
of
their
delightful
secret
began
to
save
pieces
of
bread
and
cookies
from
their
supper
every
evening
by
degrees
they
collected
a
great
heap
of
dry
crusts
and
other
refreshments
which
they
put
safely
away
in
the
garret
they
also
saved
the
apples
which
were
given
them
for
two
weeks
and
made
a
bed
in
a
big
empty
box
with
cotton
quilts
and
the
pillows
out
of
the
when
all
was
ready
katy
broke
the
plan
to
her
beloved
marianne
and
easily
persuaded
her
to
run
away
and
take
possession
of
this
new
home
we
wo
tell
papa
and
mamma
till
she
quite
grown
up
katy
said
to
clover
then
we
bring
her
down
stairs
and
they
be
surprised
do
let
call
her
marianne
any
longer
either
it
pretty
we
name
her
susquehanna
instead
susquehanna
carr
recollect
marianne
you
must
answer
if
i
call
you
marianne
only
when
i
say
susquehanna
yes
replied
marianne
very
meekly
for
a
whole
day
all
went
on
delightfully
susquehanna
lived
in
her
wooden
box
ate
all
the
apples
and
the
freshest
cookies
and
was
happy
the
two
children
took
turns
to
steal
away
and
play
with
the
baby
as
they
called
marianne
though
she
was
a
great
deal
bigger
than
clover
but
when
night
came
on
and
nurse
swooped
on
katy
and
clover
and
carried
them
off
to
bed
miss
began
to
think
that
the
garret
was
a
dreadful
place
peeping
out
of
her
box
she
could
see
black
things
standing
in
corners
which
she
did
not
recollect
seeing
in
the
they
were
really
trunks
and
brooms
and
but
somehow
in
the
darkness
they
looked
different
big
and
awful
poor
little
marianne
bore
it
as
long
as
she
could
but
when
at
last
a
rat
began
to
scratch
in
the
wall
close
beside
her
her
courage
gave
way
entirely
and
she
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
voice
what
is
that
said
carr
who
had
just
come
in
and
was
on
his
way
up
stairs
it
sounds
as
if
it
came
from
the
attic
said
carr
for
this
was
before
mamma
died
can
it
be
that
one
of
the
children
has
got
out
of
bed
and
wandered
up
stairs
in
her
sleep
no
katy
and
clover
were
safe
in
the
nursery
so
carr
took
a
candle
and
went
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
attic
where
the
yells
were
growing
terrific
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
cries
ceased
he
looked
about
nothing
was
to
be
seen
at
first
then
a
little
head
appeared
over
the
edge
of
a
big
wooden
box
and
a
piteous
voice
sobbed
out
ah
miss
katy
and
indeed
i
ca
be
stayin
any
longer
rats
in
it
who
on
earth
you
asked
the
amazed
doctor
sure
i
miss
katy
and
miss
clover
baby
but
i
do
want
to
be
a
baby
any
longer
i
want
to
go
home
and
see
my
mother
and
again
the
poor
little
midge
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
i
do
think
carr
ever
laughed
so
hard
in
his
life
as
when
finally
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
story
and
found
that
katy
and
clover
had
been
adopting
a
child
but
he
was
very
kind
to
poor
susquehanna
and
carried
her
down
stairs
in
his
arms
to
the
nursery
there
in
a
bed
close
to
the
other
children
she
soon
forgot
her
troubles
and
fell
asleep
the
little
sisters
were
much
surprised
when
they
waked
up
in
the
morning
and
found
their
baby
asleep
beside
them
but
their
joy
was
speedily
turned
to
tears
after
breakfast
carr
carried
marianne
home
to
her
mother
who
was
in
a
great
fright
over
her
disappearance
and
explained
to
the
children
that
the
garret
plan
must
be
given
up
great
was
the
mourning
in
the
nursery
but
as
marianne
was
allowed
to
come
and
play
with
them
now
and
then
they
gradually
got
over
their
grief
a
few
months
later
moved
away
from
burnet
and
that
was
the
end
of
katy
first
friendship
the
next
was
even
funnier
there
was
a
queer
old
black
woman
who
lived
all
alone
by
herself
in
a
small
house
near
the
school
this
old
woman
had
a
very
bad
temper
the
neighbors
told
horrible
stories
about
her
so
that
the
children
were
afraid
to
pass
the
house
they
used
to
turn
always
just
before
they
reached
it
and
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
this
they
did
so
regularly
that
their
feet
had
worn
a
path
in
the
grass
but
for
some
reason
katy
found
a
great
fascination
in
the
little
house
she
liked
to
dodge
about
the
door
always
holding
herself
ready
to
turn
and
run
in
case
the
old
woman
rushed
out
upon
her
with
a
broomstick
one
day
she
begged
a
large
cabbage
of
alexander
and
rolled
it
in
at
the
door
of
the
house
the
old
woman
seemed
to
like
it
and
after
this
katy
always
stopped
to
speak
when
she
went
by
she
even
got
so
far
as
to
sit
on
the
step
and
watch
the
old
woman
at
work
there
was
a
sort
of
perilous
pleasure
in
doing
this
it
was
like
sitting
at
the
entrance
of
a
lion
cage
uncertain
at
what
moment
his
majesty
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
give
a
spring
and
eat
you
up
after
this
katy
took
a
fancy
to
a
couple
of
twin
sisters
daughters
of
a
german
jeweller
they
were
quite
and
always
wore
dresses
exactly
alike
hardly
any
one
could
tell
them
apart
they
spoke
very
little
english
and
as
katy
did
know
a
word
of
german
their
intercourse
was
confined
to
smiles
and
to
the
giving
of
bunches
of
flowers
which
katy
used
to
tie
up
and
present
to
them
whenever
they
passed
the
gate
she
was
too
shy
to
do
more
than
just
put
the
flowers
in
their
hands
and
run
away
but
the
twins
were
evidently
pleased
for
one
day
when
clover
happened
to
be
looking
out
of
the
window
she
saw
them
open
the
gate
fasten
a
little
parcel
to
a
bush
and
walk
rapidly
off
of
course
she
called
katy
at
once
and
the
two
children
flew
out
to
see
what
the
parcel
was
it
held
a
bonnet
a
beautiful
doll
bonnet
of
blue
silk
trimmed
with
artificial
flowers
upon
it
was
pinned
a
slip
of
paper
with
these
words
in
an
odd
foreign
hand
to
the
nice
little
girl
who
was
so
kindly
to
give
us
some
flowers
you
can
judge
whether
katy
and
clover
were
pleased
or
not
this
was
when
katy
was
six
years
old
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
many
different
friends
she
had
set
up
since
then
there
was
an
and
a
captain
there
was
sawyer
cook
a
nice
old
woman
who
gave
katy
lessons
in
cooking
and
taught
her
to
make
soft
custard
and
there
was
a
pretty
and
dressy
whom
to
aunt
izzie
great
indignation
katy
persisted
in
calling
cousin
estelle
there
was
a
thief
in
the
under
whose
window
katy
used
to
stand
saying
i
so
sorry
poor
man
and
have
you
got
any
little
girls
like
me
in
the
most
piteous
way
the
thief
had
a
piece
of
string
which
he
let
down
from
the
window
katy
would
tie
rosebuds
and
cherries
to
this
string
and
the
thief
would
draw
them
up
it
was
so
interesting
to
do
this
that
katy
felt
dreadfully
when
they
carried
the
man
off
to
the
state
prison
then
followed
a
short
interval
of
cornelia
perham
a
nice
girl
whose
father
was
a
i
am
afraid
katy
liking
for
prunes
and
white
grapes
played
a
part
in
this
intimacy
it
was
splendid
fun
to
go
with
cornelia
to
her
father
big
shop
and
have
whole
boxes
of
raisins
and
drums
of
figs
opened
for
their
amusement
and
be
allowed
to
ride
up
and
down
in
the
elevator
as
much
as
they
liked
but
of
all
katy
queer
acquaintances
spenser
to
whom
aunt
izzie
had
alluded
was
the
queerest
spenser
was
a
mysterious
lady
whom
nobody
ever
saw
her
husband
was
a
handsome
rather
man
who
had
come
from
parts
unknown
and
rented
a
small
house
in
burnet
he
did
seem
to
have
any
particular
business
and
was
away
from
home
a
great
deal
his
wife
was
said
to
be
an
invalid
and
people
when
they
spoke
of
him
shook
their
heads
and
wondered
how
the
poor
woman
got
on
all
alone
in
the
house
while
her
husband
was
absent
of
course
katy
was
too
young
to
understand
these
whispers
or
the
reasons
why
people
were
not
disposed
to
think
well
of
spenser
the
romance
of
the
closed
door
and
the
lady
whom
nobody
saw
interested
her
very
much
she
used
to
stop
and
stare
at
the
windows
and
wonder
what
was
going
on
inside
till
at
last
it
seemed
as
if
she
know
so
one
day
she
took
some
flowers
and
victoria
her
favorite
doll
and
boldly
marched
into
the
spensers
yard
she
tapped
at
the
front
door
but
nobody
answered
then
she
tapped
again
still
nobody
answered
she
tried
the
door
it
was
locked
so
shouldering
victoria
she
trudged
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
as
she
passed
the
she
saw
that
it
was
open
a
little
way
she
knocked
for
the
third
time
and
as
no
one
came
she
went
in
and
passing
through
the
little
hall
began
to
tap
at
all
the
inside
doors
there
seemed
to
be
no
people
in
the
house
katy
peeped
into
the
kitchen
first
it
was
bare
and
forlorn
all
sorts
of
dishes
were
standing
about
there
was
no
fire
in
the
stove
the
parlor
was
not
much
better
spenser
boots
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
were
dirty
glasses
on
the
table
on
the
was
a
platter
with
bones
of
meat
upon
it
dust
lay
thick
over
everything
and
the
whole
house
looked
as
if
it
had
been
lived
in
for
at
least
a
year
katy
tried
several
other
doors
all
of
which
were
locked
and
then
she
went
up
stairs
as
she
stood
on
the
top
step
grasping
her
flowers
and
a
little
doubtful
what
to
do
next
a
feeble
voice
from
a
called
out
who
is
there
this
was
spenser
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
which
was
very
tossed
and
tumbled
as
if
it
had
been
made
up
that
morning
the
room
was
as
disorderly
and
dirty
as
all
the
rest
of
the
house
and
wrapper
and
were
by
no
means
clean
but
her
face
was
sweet
and
she
had
beautiful
curling
hair
which
fell
over
the
pillow
she
was
evidently
very
sick
and
altogether
katy
felt
sorrier
for
her
than
she
had
ever
done
for
anybody
in
her
life
who
are
you
child
asked
spenser
i
carr
little
girl
answered
katy
going
straight
up
to
the
bed
i
came
to
bring
you
some
flowers
and
she
laid
the
bouquet
on
the
dirty
sheet
spenser
seemed
to
like
the
flowers
she
took
them
up
and
smelled
them
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
but
how
did
you
get
in
she
said
at
last
the
door
was
open
faltered
katy
who
was
beginning
to
feel
scared
at
her
own
daring
and
they
said
you
were
sick
so
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
come
and
see
you
you
are
a
kind
little
girl
said
spenser
and
gave
her
a
kiss
after
this
katy
used
to
go
every
day
sometimes
spenser
would
be
up
and
moving
feebly
about
but
more
often
she
was
in
bed
and
katy
would
sit
beside
her
the
house
never
looked
a
bit
better
than
it
did
that
first
day
but
after
a
while
katy
used
to
brush
spenser
hair
and
wash
her
face
with
the
corner
of
a
towel
i
think
her
visits
were
a
comfort
to
the
poor
lady
who
was
very
ill
and
lonely
sometimes
when
she
felt
pretty
well
she
would
tell
katy
stories
about
the
time
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
lived
at
home
with
her
father
and
mother
but
she
never
spoke
of
spenser
and
katy
never
saw
him
except
once
when
she
was
so
frightened
that
for
several
days
she
dared
not
go
near
the
house
at
last
cecy
reported
that
she
had
seen
him
go
off
in
the
stage
with
his
so
katy
ventured
in
again
spenser
cried
when
she
saw
her
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
any
more
she
said
katy
was
touched
and
flattered
at
having
been
missed
and
after
that
she
never
lost
a
day
she
always
carried
the
prettiest
flowers
she
could
find
and
if
any
one
gave
her
a
specially
nice
peach
or
a
bunch
of
grapes
she
saved
it
for
spenser
aunt
izzie
was
much
worried
at
all
this
but
carr
would
not
interfere
he
said
it
was
a
case
where
grown
people
could
do
nothing
and
if
katy
was
a
comfort
to
the
poor
lady
he
was
glad
katy
was
glad
too
and
the
visits
did
her
as
much
good
as
they
did
spenser
for
the
intense
pity
she
felt
for
the
sick
woman
made
her
gentle
and
patient
as
she
had
never
been
before
one
day
she
stopped
as
usual
on
her
way
home
from
school
she
tried
the
it
was
locked
the
it
was
locked
too
all
the
blinds
were
shut
tight
this
was
very
puzzling
as
she
stood
in
the
yard
a
woman
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
of
the
next
house
it
no
use
knocking
she
said
all
the
folks
have
gone
away
gone
away
where
asked
katy
nobody
knows
said
the
woman
the
gentleman
came
back
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
this
morning
before
light
he
had
a
wagon
at
the
door
and
just
put
in
the
trunks
and
the
sick
lady
and
drove
off
there
been
more
than
one
besides
you
since
then
but
pudgett
he
got
the
key
and
nobody
can
get
in
without
goin
to
him
it
was
too
true
spenser
was
gone
and
katy
never
saw
her
again
in
a
few
days
it
came
out
that
spenser
was
a
very
bad
man
and
had
been
making
false
money
as
grown
people
call
it
the
police
were
searching
for
him
to
put
him
in
jail
and
that
was
the
reason
he
had
come
back
in
such
a
hurry
and
carried
off
his
poor
sick
wife
aunt
izzie
cried
with
mortification
when
she
heard
this
she
said
she
thought
it
was
a
disgrace
that
katy
should
have
been
visiting
in
a
counterfeiter
family
but
carr
only
laughed
he
told
aunt
izzie
that
he
did
think
that
kind
of
crime
was
catching
and
as
for
spenser
she
was
much
to
be
pitied
but
aunt
izzie
could
not
get
over
her
vexation
and
every
now
and
then
when
she
was
vexed
she
would
refer
to
the
affair
though
this
all
happened
so
long
ago
that
most
people
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
philly
and
john
had
stopped
playing
at
putting
spenser
in
jail
which
for
a
long
time
was
one
of
their
favorite
games
katy
always
felt
badly
when
aunt
izzie
spoke
unkindly
of
her
poor
sick
friend
she
had
tears
in
her
eyes
now
as
she
walked
to
the
gate
and
looked
so
very
sober
that
imogen
clark
who
stood
there
waiting
clasped
her
hands
and
said
ah
i
see
your
aristocratic
aunt
refuses
imogen
real
name
was
elizabeth
she
was
rather
a
pretty
girl
with
a
sentimental
mouth
shiny
brown
hair
and
a
little
round
curl
on
each
of
her
cheeks
these
curls
must
have
been
fastened
on
with
glue
or
tin
tacks
one
would
think
for
they
never
moved
however
much
she
laughed
or
shook
her
head
imogen
was
a
bright
girl
naturally
but
she
had
read
so
many
novels
that
her
brain
was
completely
turned
it
was
partly
this
which
made
her
so
attractive
to
katy
who
adored
stories
and
thought
imogen
was
a
real
heroine
of
romance
oh
no
she
does
she
replied
hardly
able
to
keep
from
laughing
at
the
idea
of
aunt
izzie
being
called
an
aristocratic
relative
she
says
she
shall
be
my
hap
but
here
katy
conscience
gave
a
prick
and
the
sentence
ended
in
um
um
um
so
you
come
wo
you
darling
i
am
so
glad
and
i
said
imogen
turning
up
her
eyes
theatrically
from
this
time
on
till
the
end
of
the
week
the
children
talked
of
nothing
but
imogen
visit
and
the
nice
time
they
were
going
to
have
before
breakfast
on
saturday
morning
katy
and
clover
were
at
work
building
a
beautiful
bower
of
asparagus
boughs
under
the
trees
all
the
playthings
were
set
out
in
order
debby
baked
them
some
cinnamon
cakes
the
kitten
had
a
pink
ribbon
tied
round
her
neck
and
the
dolls
including
pikery
were
arrayed
in
their
best
clothes
about
ten
imogen
arrived
she
was
dressed
in
a
barège
with
low
neck
and
short
sleeves
and
wore
coral
beads
in
her
hair
white
satin
slippers
and
a
pair
of
yellow
gloves
the
gloves
and
slippers
were
quite
dirty
and
the
barège
was
old
and
darned
but
the
general
effect
was
so
very
gorgeous
that
the
children
who
were
dressed
for
play
in
gingham
frocks
and
white
aprons
were
quite
dazzled
at
the
appearance
of
their
guest
oh
imogen
you
look
just
like
a
young
lady
in
a
story
said
simple
katy
whereupon
imogen
tossed
her
head
and
rustled
her
skirts
about
more
than
ever
somehow
with
these
fine
clothes
imogen
seemed
to
have
put
on
a
fine
manner
quite
different
from
the
one
she
used
every
day
you
know
some
people
always
do
when
they
go
out
visiting
you
would
almost
have
supposed
that
this
was
a
different
imogen
who
was
kept
in
a
box
most
of
the
time
and
taken
out
for
sundays
and
grand
occasions
she
swam
about
and
diddled
and
lisped
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
and
was
generally
and
airy
when
aunt
izzie
spoke
to
her
she
fluttered
and
behaved
so
queerly
that
clover
almost
laughed
and
even
katy
who
could
see
nothing
wrong
in
people
she
loved
was
glad
to
carry
her
away
to
the
playroom
come
out
to
the
bower
she
said
putting
her
arm
round
the
blue
barège
waist
a
bower
cried
imogen
how
sweet
but
when
they
reached
the
asparagus
boughs
her
face
fell
why
it
has
any
roof
or
pinnacles
or
any
fountain
she
said
why
no
of
course
not
said
clover
staring
we
made
it
ourselves
oh
said
imogen
she
was
evidently
disappointed
katy
and
clover
felt
mortified
but
as
their
visitor
did
not
care
for
the
bower
they
tried
to
think
of
something
else
let
us
go
to
the
loft
they
said
so
they
all
crossed
the
yard
together
imogen
picked
her
way
daintily
in
the
white
satin
slippers
but
when
she
saw
the
spiked
post
she
gave
a
scream
oh
not
up
there
darling
not
up
there
she
cried
never
never
oh
do
try
it
just
as
easy
as
can
be
pleaded
katy
going
up
and
down
half
a
dozen
times
in
succession
to
show
how
easy
it
was
but
imogen
would
be
persuaded
do
not
ask
me
she
said
affectedly
my
nerves
would
never
stand
such
a
thing
and
besides
my
dress
what
made
you
wear
it
said
philly
who
was
a
child
and
given
to
questions
while
john
whispered
to
dorry
that
a
real
stupid
girl
let
go
off
somewhere
and
play
by
ourselves
so
one
by
one
the
small
fry
crept
away
leaving
katy
and
clover
to
entertain
the
visitor
by
themselves
they
tried
dolls
but
imogen
did
not
care
for
dolls
then
they
proposed
to
sit
down
in
the
shade
and
cap
verses
a
game
they
all
liked
but
imogen
said
that
though
she
adored
poetry
she
never
could
remember
any
so
it
ended
in
their
going
to
the
orchard
where
imogen
ate
a
great
many
plums
and
early
apples
and
really
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
but
when
she
could
eat
no
more
a
dreadful
dulness
fell
over
the
party
at
last
imogen
said
do
you
ever
sit
in
the
the
what
asked
clover
the
repeated
imogen
oh
she
means
the
parlor
cried
katy
no
we
do
sit
there
except
when
aunt
izzie
has
company
to
tea
it
is
all
dark
and
poky
you
know
beside
it
so
much
pleasanter
to
be
do
you
think
so
yes
sometimes
replied
imogen
doubtfully
but
i
think
it
would
be
pleasant
to
go
in
and
sit
there
for
a
while
now
my
head
aches
dreadfully
being
out
here
in
this
horrid
sun
katy
was
at
her
wit
end
to
know
what
to
do
they
scarcely
ever
went
into
the
parlor
which
aunt
izzie
regarded
as
a
sort
of
sacred
place
she
kept
cotton
petticoats
over
all
the
chairs
for
fear
of
dust
and
never
opened
the
blinds
for
fear
of
flies
the
idea
of
children
with
dusty
boots
going
in
there
to
sit
on
the
other
hand
katy
natural
politeness
made
it
hard
to
refuse
a
visitor
anything
she
asked
for
and
beside
it
was
dreadful
to
think
that
imogen
might
go
away
and
report
katy
carr
is
allowed
to
sit
in
the
best
room
even
when
she
has
company
with
a
quaking
heart
she
led
the
way
to
the
parlor
she
dared
not
open
the
blinds
so
the
room
looked
very
dark
she
could
just
see
imogen
figure
as
she
sat
on
the
sofa
and
clover
twirling
uneasily
about
on
the
all
the
time
she
kept
listening
to
hear
if
aunt
izzie
were
not
coming
and
altogether
the
parlor
was
a
dismal
place
to
her
not
half
so
pleasant
as
the
asparagus
bower
where
they
felt
perfectly
safe
but
imogen
who
for
the
first
time
seemed
comfortable
began
to
talk
her
talk
was
about
herself
such
stories
she
told
about
the
things
which
had
happened
to
her
all
the
young
ladies
in
the
ledger
put
together
never
had
stranger
adventures
gradually
katy
and
clover
got
so
interested
that
they
left
their
seats
and
crouched
down
close
to
the
sofa
listening
with
open
mouths
to
these
stories
katy
forgot
to
listen
for
aunt
izzie
the
parlor
door
swung
open
but
she
did
not
notice
it
she
did
not
even
hear
the
front
door
shut
when
papa
came
home
to
dinner
carr
stopping
in
the
hall
to
glance
over
his
newspaper
heard
the
voice
running
on
in
the
parlor
at
first
he
hardly
listened
then
these
words
caught
his
ear
oh
it
was
lovely
girls
perfectly
delicious
i
suppose
i
did
look
well
for
i
was
all
in
white
with
my
hair
let
down
and
just
one
rose
you
know
here
on
top
and
he
leaned
over
me
and
said
in
a
low
deep
tone
i
am
a
brigand
but
i
feel
the
enchanting
power
of
your
beauty
you
are
free
carr
pushed
the
door
open
a
little
farther
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
some
indistinct
figures
but
he
heard
katy
voice
in
an
eager
tone
oh
go
on
what
happened
next
who
on
earth
have
the
children
got
in
the
parlor
he
asked
aunt
izzie
whom
he
found
in
the
the
parlor
cried
miss
izzie
wrathfully
why
what
are
they
there
for
then
going
to
the
door
she
called
out
children
what
are
you
doing
in
the
parlor
come
out
right
away
i
thought
you
were
playing
imogen
had
a
faltered
katy
the
three
girls
came
out
into
the
hall
clover
and
katy
looking
scared
and
even
the
enchanter
of
the
brigand
quite
oh
said
aunt
izzie
grimly
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
probably
you
are
bilious
would
you
like
some
camphor
or
anything
no
thank
you
replied
imogen
meekly
but
afterwards
she
whispered
to
katy
your
aunt
is
very
nice
i
think
she
just
like
jackima
that
horrid
old
woman
i
told
you
about
who
lived
in
the
brigand
cave
and
did
the
cooking
i
do
think
you
a
bit
polite
to
tell
me
so
retorted
katy
very
angry
at
this
speech
oh
never
mind
dear
do
take
it
to
heart
replied
imogen
sweetly
we
ca
help
having
relations
that
ai
nice
you
know
the
visit
was
evidently
not
a
success
papa
was
very
civil
to
imogen
at
dinner
but
he
watched
her
closely
and
katy
saw
a
comical
twinkle
in
his
eye
which
she
did
not
like
papa
had
very
droll
eyes
they
saw
everything
and
sometimes
they
seemed
to
talk
almost
as
distinctly
as
his
tongue
katy
began
to
feel
she
confessed
afterward
that
she
should
never
have
got
through
the
afternoon
if
she
had
run
up
stairs
two
or
three
times
and
comforted
herself
by
reading
a
little
in
rosamond
are
you
glad
she
gone
whispered
clover
as
they
stood
at
the
gate
together
watching
imogen
walk
down
the
street
oh
clover
how
can
you
said
katy
but
she
gave
clover
a
great
hug
and
i
think
in
her
heart
she
glad
katy
said
papa
next
day
you
came
into
the
room
then
exactly
like
your
new
friend
miss
clark
how
i
do
know
what
you
mean
answered
katy
blushing
deeply
said
carr
and
he
got
up
raising
his
shoulders
and
squaring
his
elbows
and
took
a
few
mincing
steps
across
the
room
katy
help
laughing
it
was
so
funny
and
so
like
imogen
then
papa
sat
down
again
and
drew
her
close
to
him
my
dear
he
said
you
an
affectionate
child
and
i
glad
of
it
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
throwing
away
one
affection
i
did
fancy
that
little
girl
at
all
yesterday
what
makes
you
like
her
so
much
i
did
like
her
so
much
yesterday
admitted
katy
reluctantly
she
a
great
deal
nicer
than
that
at
school
sometimes
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
her
father
for
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
you
really
admired
such
silly
manners
and
what
was
that
nonsense
i
heard
her
telling
you
about
brigands
it
really
hap
began
then
she
caught
papa
eye
and
bit
her
lip
for
he
looked
very
quizzical
well
she
went
on
laughing
i
suppose
it
did
really
all
happen
but
it
was
ever
so
funny
papa
even
if
it
was
a
and
imogen
just
as
as
can
be
all
the
girls
like
her
are
all
very
well
said
papa
as
long
as
people
do
try
to
make
you
believe
they
are
true
when
they
do
that
it
seems
to
me
it
comes
too
near
the
edge
of
falsehood
to
be
very
safe
or
pleasant
if
i
were
you
katy
i
be
a
little
shy
of
swearing
eternal
friendship
for
miss
clark
she
may
be
as
you
say
but
i
think
two
or
three
years
hence
she
wo
seem
so
nice
to
you
as
she
does
now
give
me
a
kiss
chick
and
run
away
for
there
alexander
with

buggy
chapter
vii
cousin
helen
visit
a
little
knot
of
the
were
walking
home
together
one
afternoon
in
july
as
they
neared
carr
gate
maria
fiske
exclaimed
at
the
sight
of
a
pretty
bunch
of
flowers
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
oh
my
she
cried
see
what
somebody
dropped
i
going
to
have
it
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
but
just
as
her
fingers
touched
the
stems
the
nosegay
as
if
bewitched
began
to
move
maria
made
a
bewildered
clutch
the
nosegay
moved
faster
and
at
last
vanished
under
the
gate
while
a
giggle
sounded
from
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
did
you
see
that
shrieked
maria
those
flowers
ran
away
of
themselves
nonsense
said
katy
it
those
absurd
children
then
opening
the
gate
she
called
john
dorry
come
out
and
show
yourselves
but
nobody
replied
and
no
one
could
be
seen
the
nosegay
lay
on
the
path
however
and
picking
it
up
katy
exhibited
to
the
girls
a
long
end
of
black
thread
tied
to
the
stems
that
a
very
favorite
trick
of
johnnie
she
said
she
and
dorry
are
always
tying
up
flowers
and
putting
them
out
on
the
walk
to
tease
people
here
maria
take
if
you
like
though
i
do
think
taste
in
bouquets
is
very
good
is
it
splendid
to
have
vacation
come
said
one
of
the
bigger
girls
what
are

to
the
seaside

maria
i
going
to
make
my
aunt
a
visit

alice
blair
she
lives
in
a
real
lovely
place
in
the

and
there

pond
there

splendid
times
replied
katy
throwing
her
bag
of
books
into
the
air
and
catching
it
again
but
the
other
girls
looked
as
if
they
did
think
this
good
fun
at
all
and
as
if
they
were
sorry
for
her
and
katy
felt
suddenly
that
her
vacation
was
going
to
be
so
pleasant
as
that
of
the
rest
i
wish
papa
take
us
somewhere
she
said
to
clover
as
they
walked
up
the
gravel
path
all
the
other
girls
papas
do
he
too
busy
replied
clover
beside
i
do
think
any
of
the
rest
of
the
girls
have
half
such
good
times
as
we
ellen
robbins
says
give
a
million
of
dollars
for
such
nice
brothers
and
sisters
as
ours
to
play
with
and
you
know
maria
and
susie
have
times
at
home
though
they
do
go
to
places
fiske
is
so
particular
she
always
says
and
they
have
got
any
yard
to
their
house
or
anything
i
would
change
nor
i
said
katy
cheering
up
at
these
words
of
wisdom
oh
is
it
lovely
to
think
there
wo
be
any
school
vacations
are
just
splendid
and
she
gave
her
bag
another
toss
it
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
there
you
cracked
your
slate
said
clover
no
matter
i
want
it
again
for
eight
weeks
replied
katy
comfortably
as
they
ran
up
the
steps
they
burst
open
the
front
door
and
raced
up
stairs
crying
hurrah
hurrah
vacation
begun
aunt
izzie
vacation
begun
then
they
stopped
short
for
lo
the
upper
hall
was
all
in
confusion
sounds
of
beating
and
dusting
came
from
the
spare
room
tables
and
chairs
were
standing
about
and
a
which
seemed
to
be
taking
a
walk
all
by
itself
had
stopped
short
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
barred
the
way
why
how
queer
said
katy
trying
to
get
by
what
be
going
to
happen
oh
there
aunt
izzie
aunt
izzie
who
coming
what
you
moving
the
things
out
of
the
for
oh
gracious
is
that
you
replied
aunt
izzie
who
looked
very
hot
and
flurried
now
children
it
no
use
for
you
to
stand
there
asking
questions
i
have
got
time
to
answer
them
let
the
bedstead
alone
katy
you
push
it
into
the
wall
there
i
told
you
so
as
katy
gave
an
impatient
shove
you
made
a
bad
mark
on
the
paper
what
a
troublesome
child
you
are
go
right
down
stairs
both
of
you
and
come
up
this
way
again
till
after
tea
i
just
as
much
as
i
can
possibly
attend
to
till
then
just
tell
us
what
going
to
happen
and
we
will
cried
the
children
your
cousin
helen
is
coming
to
visit
us
said
miss
izzie
curtly
and
disappeared
into
the
this
was
news
indeed
katy
and
clover
ran
down
stairs
in
great
excitement
and
after
consulting
a
little
retired
to
the
loft
to
talk
it
over
in
peace
and
quiet
cousin
helen
coming
it
seemed
as
strange
as
if
queen
victoria
gold
crown
and
all
had
invited
herself
to
tea
or
as
if
some
character
out
of
a
book
robinson
crusoe
say
or
amy
herbert
had
driven
up
with
a
trunk
and
announced
the
intention
of
spending
a
week
for
to
the
imaginations
of
the
children
cousin
helen
was
as
interesting
and
unreal
as
anybody
in
the
fairy
tales
cinderella
or
or
dear
red
herself
only
there
was
a
sort
of
mixture
of
book
in
their
idea
of
her
for
cousin
helen
was
very
very
good
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
her
philly
said
he
was
sure
she
had
any
legs
because
she
never
went
away
from
home
and
lay
on
a
sofa
all
the
time
but
the
rest
knew
that
this
was
because
cousin
helen
was
papa
always
went
to
visit
her
twice
a
year
and
he
liked
to
talk
to
the
children
about
her
and
tell
how
sweet
and
patient
she
was
and
what
a
pretty
room
she
lived
in
katy
and
clover
had
played
cousin
helen
so
long
that
now
they
were
frightened
as
well
as
glad
at
the
idea
of
seeing
the
real
one
do
you
suppose
she
will
want
us
to
say
hymns
to
her
all
the
time
asked
clover
not
all
the
time
replied
katy
because
you
know
she
get
tired
and
have
to
take
naps
in
the
afternoons
and
then
of
course
she
reads
the
bible
a
great
deal
oh
dear
how
quiet
we
shall
have
to
be
i
wonder
how
long
she
going
to
stay
what
do
you
suppose
she
looks
like
went
on
clover
something
like
in
sherwood
i
guess
with
blue
eyes
and
curls
and
a
long
straight
nose
and
she
keep
her
hands
clasped
all
the
time
and
wear
wrappers
and
lie
on
the
sofa
perfectly
still
and
never
smile
but
just
look
patient
we
have
to
take
off
our
boots
in
the
hall
clover
and
go
up
stairs
in
stocking
feet
so
as
not
to
make
a
noise
all
the
time
she
stays
wo
it
be
funny
giggled
clover
her
sober
little
face
growing
bright
at
the
idea
of
this
variation
on
the
hymns
the
time
seemed
very
long
till
the
next
afternoon
when
cousin
helen
was
expected
aunt
izzie
who
was
in
a
great
excitement
gave
the
children
many
orders
about
their
behavior
they
were
to
do
this
and
that
and
not
to
do
the
other
dorry
at
last
announced
that
he
wished
cousin
helen
would
just
stay
at
home
clover
and
elsie
who
had
been
thinking
pretty
much
the
same
thing
in
private
were
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
a
water
cure
and
would
stay
only
four
days
five
came
they
all
sat
on
the
steps
waiting
for
the
carriage
at
last
it
drove
up
papa
was
on
the
box
he
motioned
the
children
to
stand
back
then
he
helped
out
a
young
woman
who
aunt
izzie
told
them
was
cousin
helen
nurse
and
then
very
carefully
lifted
cousin
helen
in
his
arms
and
brought
her
in
oh
there
are
the
chicks
were
the
first
words
the
children
heard
in
such
a
gay
pleasant
voice
do
set
me
down
somewhere
uncle
i
want
to
see
them
so
much
so
papa
put
cousin
helen
on
the
hall
sofa
the
nurse
fetched
a
pillow
and
when
she
was
made
comfortable
carr
called
to
the
little
ones
cousin
helen
wants
to
see
you
he
said
indeed
i
do
said
the
bright
voice
so
this
is
katy
why
what
a
splendid
tall
katy
it
is
and
this
is
clover
kissing
her
and
this
dear
little
elsie
you
all
look
as
natural
as
possible
just
as
if
i
had
seen
you
before
and
she
hugged
them
all
round
not
as
if
it
was
polite
to
like
them
because
they
were
relations
but
as
if
she
had
loved
them
and
wanted
them
all
her
life
there
was
something
in
cousin
helen
face
and
manner
which
made
the
children
at
home
with
her
at
once
even
philly
who
had
backed
away
with
his
hands
behind
him
after
staring
hard
for
a
minute
or
two
came
up
with
a
sort
of
rush
to
get
his
share
of
kissing
still
katy
first
feeling
was
one
of
disappointment
cousin
helen
was
not
at
all
like
lucy
in
sherwood
story
her
nose
turned
up
the
least
bit
in
the
world
she
had
brown
hair
which
did
curl
a
brown
skin
and
bright
eyes
which
danced
when
she
laughed
or
spoke
her
face
was
thin
but
except
for
that
you
would
have
guessed
that
she
was
sick
she
did
fold
her
hands
and
she
did
look
patient
but
absolutely
glad
and
merry
her
dress
was
a
frilled
wrapper
but
a
sort
of
loose
travelling
thing
of
pretty
gray
stuff
with
a
bow
and
bracelets
and
a
round
hat
trimmed
with
a
gray
feather
all
katy
dreams
about
the
saintly
invalid
seemed
to
take
wings
and
fly
away
but
the
more
she
watched
cousin
helen
the
more
she
seemed
to
like
her
and
to
feel
as
if
she
were
nicer
than
the
imaginary
person
which
she
and
clover
had
invented
she
looks
just
like
other
people
do
she
whispered
cecy
who
had
come
over
to
have
a
peep
at
the
new
arrival
replied
katy
doubtfully
only
a
great
great
deal
prettier
by
and
by
papa
carried
cousin
helen
up
stairs
all
the
children
wanted
to
go
too
but
he
told
them
she
was
tired
and
must
rest
so
they
went
out
doors
to
play
till
oh
do
let
me
take
up
the
tray
cried
katy
at
the
as
she
watched
aunt
izzie
getting
ready
cousin
helen
supper
such
a
nice
supper
cold
chicken
and
raspberries
and
cream
and
tea
in
a
pretty
china
cup
and
such
a
napkin
as
aunt
izzie
spread
over
the
tray
no
indeed
said
aunt
izzie
you
drop
it
the
first
thing
but
katy
eyes
begged
so
hard
that
carr
said
yes
let
her
izzie
i
like
to
see
the
girls
useful
so
katy
proud
of
the
commission
took
the
tray
and
carried
it
carefully
across
the
hall
there
was
a
bowl
of
flowers
on
the
table
as
she
passed
she
was
struck
with
a
bright
idea
she
set
down
the
tray
and
picking
out
a
rose
laid
it
on
the
napkin
besides
the
saucer
of
crimson
raspberries
it
looked
very
pretty
and
katy
smiled
to
herself
with
pleasure
what
are
you
stopping
for
called
aunt
izzie
from
the
do
be
careful
katy
i
really
think
bridget
had
better
take
it
oh
no
no
protested
katy
i
most
up
already
and
she
sped
up
stairs
as
fast
as
she
could
go
luckless
speed
she
had
just
reached
the
door
of
the
when
she
tripped
upon
her
which
as
usual
was
dangling
made
a
misstep
and
stumbled
she
caught
at
the
door
to
save
herself
the
door
flew
open
and
katy
with
the
tray
cream
raspberries
rose
and
all
descended
in
a
confused
heap
upon
the
carpet
i
told
you
so
exclaimed
aunt
izzie
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
katy
never
forgot
how
kind
cousin
helen
was
on
this
occasion
she
was
in
bed
and
was
of
course
a
good
deal
startled
at
the
sudden
crash
and
tumble
on
her
floor
but
after
one
little
jump
nothing
could
have
been
sweeter
than
the
way
in
which
she
comforted
poor
katy
and
made
so
merry
over
the
accident
that
even
aunt
izzie
almost
forgot
to
scold
the
broken
dishes
were
piled
up
and
the
carpet
made
clean
again
while
aunt
izzie
prepared
another
tray
just
as
nice
as
the
first
please
let
katy
bring
it
up
pleaded
cousin
helen
in
her
pleasant
voice
i
am
sure
she
will
be
careful
this
time
and
katy
i
want
just
such
another
rose
on
the
napkin
i
guess
that
was
your
doing
was
it
katy
this
time
all
went
well
the
tray
was
placed
safely
on
a
little
table
beside
the
bed
and
katy
sat
watching
cousin
helen
eat
her
supper
with
a
warm
loving
feeling
at
her
heart
i
think
we
are
scarcely
ever
so
grateful
to
people
as
when
they
help
us
to
get
back
our
own
cousin
helen
had
much
appetite
though
she
declared
everything
was
delicious
katy
could
see
that
she
was
very
tired
now
she
said
when
she
had
finished
if
you
shake
up
this
pillow
and
move
this
other
pillow
a
little
i
think
i
will
settle
myself
to
sleep
thanks
that
just
right
why
katy
dear
you
are
a
born
nurse
now
kiss
me
we
will
have
a
nice
talk
katy
went
down
stairs
very
happy
cousin
helen
perfectly
lovely
she
told
clover
and
she
got
on
the
most
all
lace
and
ruffles
it
just
like
a
in
a
book
is
it
wicked
to
care
about
clothes
when
you
sick
questioned
cecy
i
do
believe
cousin
helen
do
anything
wicked
said
katy
i
told
ma
that
she
had
on
bracelets
and
ma
said
she
feared
your
cousin
was
a
worldly
person
retorted
cecy
primming
up
her
lips
katy
and
clover
were
quite
distressed
at
this
opinion
they
talked
about
it
while
they
were
undressing
i
mean
to
ask
cousin
helen
said
katy
next
morning
the
children
got
up
very
early
they
were
so
glad
that
it
was
vacation
if
it
had
been
they
would
have
been
forced
to
go
to
school
without
seeing
cousin
helen
for
she
did
wake
till
late
they
grew
so
impatient
of
the
delay
and
went
up
stairs
so
often
to
listen
at
the
door
and
see
if
she
were
moving
that
aunt
izzie
finally
had
to
order
them
off
katy
rebelled
against
this
order
a
good
deal
but
she
consoled
herself
by
going
into
the
garden
and
picking
the
prettiest
flowers
she
could
find
to
give
to
cousin
helen
the
moment
she
should
see
her
when
aunt
izzie
let
her
go
up
cousin
helen
was
lying
on
the
sofa
all
dressed
for
the
day
in
a
fresh
blue
muslin
with
blue
ribbons
and
cunning
bronze
slippers
with
rosettes
on
the
toes
the
sofa
had
been
wheeled
round
with
its
back
to
the
light
there
was
a
cushion
with
a
pretty
fluted
cover
that
katy
had
never
seen
before
and
several
other
things
were
scattered
about
which
gave
the
room
quite
a
different
air
all
the
house
was
neat
but
somehow
aunt
izzie
rooms
never
were
pretty
children
eyes
are
quick
to
perceive
such
things
and
katy
saw
at
once
that
the
had
never
looked
like
this
cousin
helen
was
white
and
tired
but
her
eyes
and
smile
were
as
bright
as
ever
she
was
delighted
with
the
flowers
which
katy
presented
rather
shyly
oh
how
lovely
she
said
i
must
put
them
in
water
right
away
katy
dear
do
you
want
to
bring
that
little
vase
on
the
bureau
and
set
it
on
this
chair
beside
me
and
please
pour
a
little
water
into
it
first
what
a
beauty
cried
katy
as
she
lifted
the
graceful
white
cup
swung
on
a
gilt
stand
is
it
yours
cousin
helen
yes
it
is
my
pet
vase
it
stands
on
a
little
table
beside
me
at
home
and
i
fancied
that
the
water
cure
would
seem
more
if
i
had
it
with
me
there
so
i
brought
it
along
but
why
do
you
look
so
puzzled
katy
does
it
seem
queer
that
a
vase
should
travel
about
in
a
trunk
no
said
katy
slowly
i
was
only
thinking
cousin
helen
is
it
worldly
to
have
pretty
things
when
you
sick
cousin
helen
laughed
heartily
what
put
that
idea
into
your
head
she
asked
cecy
said
so
when
i
told
her
about
your
beautiful
cousin
helen
laughed
again
well
she
said
i
tell
you
what
i
think
katy
pretty
things
are
no
more
than
ugly
ones
except
when
they
spoil
us
by
making
us
vain
or
careless
of
the
comfort
of
other
people
and
sickness
is
such
a
disagreeable
thing
in
itself
that
unless
sick
people
take
great
pains
they
soon
grow
to
be
eyesores
to
themselves
and
everybody
about
them
i
do
think
it
is
possible
for
an
invalid
to
be
too
particular
and
when
one
has
the
and
the
and
the
ache
she
added
smiling
there
is
much
danger
of
growing
vain
because
of
a
ruffle
more
or
less
on
one
or
a
bit
of
bright
ribbon
then
she
began
to
arrange
the
flowers
touching
each
separate
one
gently
and
as
if
she
loved
it
what
a
queer
noise
she
exclaimed
suddenly
stopping
it
queer
a
sort
of
snuffing
and
snorting
sound
as
if
a
walrus
or
a
were
promenading
up
and
down
in
the
hall
katy
opened
the
door
behold
there
were
john
and
dorry
very
red
in
the
face
from
flattening
their
noses
against
the
in
a
vain
attempt
to
see
if
cousin
helen
were
up
and
ready
to
receive
company
oh
let
them
come
in
cried
cousin
helen
from
her
sofa
so
they
came
in
followed
before
long
by
clover
and
elsie
such
a
merry
morning
as
they
had
cousin
helen
proved
to
possess
a
perfect
genius
for
and
for
suggesting
games
which
could
be
played
about
her
sofa
and
did
not
make
more
noise
than
she
could
bear
aunt
izzie
dropping
in
about
eleven
found
them
having
such
a
good
time
that
almost
before
she
knew
it
was
drawn
into
the
game
too
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
there
sat
aunt
izzie
on
the
floor
with
three
long
stuck
in
her
hair
playing
i
a
genteel
lady
always
genteel
in
the
jolliest
manner
possible
the
children
were
so
enchanted
at
the
spectacle
that
they
could
hardly
attend
to
the
game
and
were
always
forgetting
how
many
horns
they
had
clover
privately
thought
that
cousin
helen
must
be
a
witch
and
papa
when
he
came
home
at
noon
said
almost
the
same
thing
what
have
you
been
doing
to
them
helen
he
inquired
as
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
the
merry
circle
on
the
carpet
aunt
izzie
hair
was
half
pulled
down
and
philly
was
rolling
over
and
over
in
convulsions
of
laughter
but
cousin
helen
said
she
had
done
anything
and
pretty
soon
papa
was
on
the
floor
too
playing
away
as
fast
as
the
rest
i
must
put
a
stop
to
this
he
cried
when
everybody
was
tired
of
laughing
and
everybody
head
was
stuck
as
full
of
paper
quills
as
a
porcupine
back
cousin
helen
will
be
worn
out
run
away
all
of
you
and
do
come
near
this
door
again
till
the
clock
strikes
four
do
you
hear
chicks
run
run
shoo
shoo
the
children
scuttled
away
like
a
brood
of
fowls
all
but
katy
oh
papa
i
be
quiet
she
pleaded
might
i
stay
just
till
the
rings
do
let
her
said
cousin
helen
so
papa
said
yes
katy
sat
on
the
floor
holding
cousin
helen
hand
and
listening
to
her
talk
with
papa
it
interested
her
though
it
was
about
things
and
people
she
did
not
know
how
is
alex
asked
carr
at
length
quite
well
now
replied
cousin
helen
with
one
of
her
brightest
looks
he
was
run
down
and
tired
in
the
spring
and
we
were
a
little
anxious
about
him
but
emma
persuaded
him
to
take
a
fortnight
vacation
and
he
came
back
all
right
do
you
see
them
often
almost
every
day
and
little
helen
comes
every
day
you
know
for
her
lessons
is
she
as
pretty
as
she
used
to
be
oh
yes
prettier
i
think
she
is
a
lovely
little
creature
having
her
so
much
with
me
is
one
of
my
greatest
treats
alex
tries
to
think
that
she
looks
a
little
as
i
used
to
but
that
is
a
compliment
so
great
that
i
dare
not
appropriate
it
carr
stooped
and
kissed
cousin
helen
as
if
he
could
not
help
it
my
child
he
said
that
was
all
but
something
in
the
tone
made
katy
curious
papa
she
said
after
dinner
who
is
alex
that
you
and
cousin
helen
were
talking
about
why
katy
what
makes
you
want
to
know
i
ca
exactly
tell
only
cousin
helen
looked
so
and
you
kissed
her
and
i
thought
perhaps
it
was
something
interesting
so
it
is
said
carr
drawing
her
on
to
his
knee
i
a
mind
to
tell
you
about
it
katy
because
you
old
enough
to
see
how
beautiful
it
is
and
wise
enough
i
hope
not
to
chatter
or
ask
questions
alex
is
the
name
of
somebody
who
long
ago
when
cousin
helen
was
well
and
strong
she
loved
and
expected
to
marry
oh
why
did
she
cried
katy
she
met
with
a
dreadful
accident
continued
carr
for
a
long
time
they
thought
she
would
die
then
she
grew
slowly
better
and
the
doctors
told
her
that
she
might
live
a
good
many
years
but
that
she
would
have
to
lie
on
her
sofa
always
and
be
helpless
and
a
cripple
alex
felt
dreadfully
when
he
heard
this
he
wanted
to
marry
cousin
helen
just
the
same
and
be
her
nurse
and
take
care
of
her
always
but
she
would
not
consent
she
broke
the
engagement
and
told
him
that
some
day
she
hoped
he
would
love
somebody
else
well
enough
to
marry
her
so
after
a
good
many
years
he
did
and
now
he
and
his
wife
live
next
door
to
cousin
helen
and
are
her
dearest
friends
their
little
girl
is
named
all
their
plans
are
talked
over
with
her
and
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
they
think
so
much
of
but
does
it
make
cousin
helen
feel
bad
when
she
sees
them
walking
about
and
enjoying
themselves
and
she
ca
move
asked
katy
no
said
carr
it
does
because
cousin
helen
is
half
an
angel
already
and
loves
other
people
better
than
herself
i
very
glad
she
could
come
here
for
once
she
an
example
to
us
all
katy
and
i
could
ask
anything
better
than
to
have
my
little
girls
take
pattern
after
her
it
must
be
awful
to
be
sick
soliloquized
katy
after
papa
was
gone
why
if
i
had
to
stay
in
bed
a
whole
week
i
should
i
know
i
should
poor
katy
it
seemed
to
her
as
it
does
to
almost
all
young
people
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
easy
as
to
die
the
moment
things
go
wrong
this
conversation
with
papa
made
cousin
helen
doubly
interesting
in
katy
eyes
it
was
just
like
something
in
a
book
to
be
in
the
same
house
with
the
heroine
of
a
so
sad
and
sweet
the
play
that
afternoon
was
much
interrupted
for
every
few
minutes
somebody
had
to
run
in
and
see
if
it
was
four
the
instant
the
hour
came
all
six
children
galloped
up
stairs
i
think
we
tell
stories
this
time
said
cousin
helen
so
they
told
stories
cousin
helen
were
the
best
of
all
there
was
one
of
them
about
a
robber
which
sent
delightful
chills
creeping
down
all
their
backs
all
but
philly
he
was
so
excited
that
he
grew
warlike
i
ai
afraid
of
robbers
he
declared
strutting
up
and
down
when
they
come
i
shall
just
cut
them
in
two
with
my
sword
which
papa
gave
me
they
did
come
once
i
did
cut
them
in
two
three
five
eleven
of
you
see
but
that
evening
after
the
younger
children
were
gone
to
bed
and
katy
and
clover
were
sitting
in
the
a
lamentable
howling
was
heard
from
the
nursery
clover
ran
to
see
what
was
the
matter
behold
there
was
phil
sitting
up
in
bed
and
crying
for
help
there
robbers
under
the
bed
he
sobbed
ever
so
many
robbers
why
no
philly
said
clover
peeping
under
the
valance
to
satisfy
him
there
is
anybody
there
yes
there
is
i
tell
you
declared
phil
holding
her
tight
i
heard
one
they
were
my
poor
little
fellow
said
cousin
helen
when
clover
having
pacified
phil
came
back
to
report
it
a
warning
against
robber
stories
but
this
one
ended
so
well
that
i
did
think
of
anybody
being
frightened
it
was
no
use
after
this
for
aunt
izzie
to
make
rules
about
going
into
the
she
might
as
well
have
ordered
flies
to
keep
away
from
a
by
hook
or
by
crook
the
children
get
up
stairs
whenever
aunt
izzie
went
in
she
was
sure
to
find
them
there
just
as
close
to
cousin
helen
as
they
could
get
and
cousin
helen
begged
her
not
to
interfere
we
have
only
three
or
four
days
to
be
together
she
said
let
them
come
as
much
as
they
like
it
wo
hurt
me
a
bit
little
elsie
clung
with
a
passionate
love
to
this
new
friend
cousin
helen
had
sharp
eyes
she
saw
the
wistful
look
in
elsie
face
at
once
and
took
special
pains
to
be
sweet
and
tender
to
her
this
preference
made
katy
jealous
she
could
bear
to
share
her
cousin
with
anybody
when
the
last
evening
came
and
they
went
up
after
tea
to
the
cousin
helen
was
opening
a
box
which
had
just
come
by
express
it
is
a
box
she
said
all
of
you
must
sit
down
in
a
row
and
when
i
hide
my
hands
behind
me
you
must
choose
in
turn
which
you
will
take
so
they
all
chose
in
turn
which
hand
will
you
have
the
right
or
the
left
and
cousin
helen
with
the
air
of
a
wise
fairy
brought
out
from
behind
her
pillow
something
pretty
for
each
one
first
came
a
vase
exactly
like
her
own
which
katy
had
admired
so
much
katy
screamed
with
delight
as
it
was
placed
in
her
hands
oh
how
lovely
how
lovely
she
cried
i
keep
it
as
long
as
i
live
and
breathe
if
you
do
it
be
the
first
time
you
ever
kept
anything
for
a
week
without
breaking
it
remarked
aunt
izzie
next
came
a
pretty
purple
for
clover
it
was
just
what
she
wanted
for
she
had
lost
her
then
a
cunning
little
locket
on
a
bit
of
velvet
ribbon
which
cousin
helen
tied
round
elsie
neck
there
a
piece
of
my
hair
in
it
she
said
why
elsie
darling
what
the
matter
do
cry
so
oh
you
beautiful
and
sweet
sobbed
elsie
and
away
dorry
had
a
box
of
dominoes
and
john
a
solitaire
board
for
phil
there
appeared
a
book
the
history
of
the
robber
cat
that
will
remind
you
of
the
night
when
the
thieves
came
and
chewed
your
said
cousin
helen
with
a
mischievous
smile
they
all
laughed
phil
loudest
of
all
nobody
was
forgotten
there
was
a
notebook
for
papa
and
a
set
of
ivory
tablets
for
aunt
izzie
even
cecy
was
remembered
her
present
was
the
book
of
golden
deeds
with
all
sorts
of
stories
about
boys
and
girls
who
had
done
brave
and
good
things
she
was
almost
too
pleased
to
speak
oh
thank
you
cousin
helen
she
said
at
last
cecy
was
a
cousin
but
she
and
the
carr
children
were
in
the
habit
of
sharing
their
aunts
and
uncles
and
relations
generally
as
they
did
their
other
good
things
next
day
came
the
sad
parting
all
the
little
ones
stood
at
the
gate
to
wave
their
as
the
carriage
drove
away
when
it
was
quite
out
of
sight
katy
rushed
off
to
weep
a
little
weep
all
by
herself
papa
said
he
wished
we
were
all
like
cousin
helen
she
thought
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
i
mean
to
try
though
i
do
suppose
if
i
tried
a
thousand
years
i
should
ever
get
to
be
half
so
good
i
study
and
keep
my
things
in
order
and
be
ever
so
kind
to
the
little
ones
dear
me
if
only
aunt
izzie
was
cousin
helen
how
easy
it
would
be
never
mind
i
think
about
her
all
the
time
and
i
begin
chapter
viii
i
will
begin
thought
katy
as
she
dropped
asleep
that
night
how
often
we
all
do
so
and
what
a
pity
it
is
that
when
morning
comes
and
is
we
so
frequently
wake
up
feeling
quite
differently
careless
or
impatient
and
not
a
bit
inclined
to
do
the
fine
things
we
planned
overnight
sometimes
it
seems
as
if
there
must
be
wicked
little
imps
in
the
world
who
are
kept
tied
up
so
long
as
the
sun
shines
but
who
creep
into
our
when
we
are
asleep
to
tease
us
and
ruffle
our
tempers
else
why
when
we
go
to
rest
and
pleasant
should
we
wake
up
so
cross
now
there
was
katy
her
last
sleepy
thought
was
an
intention
to
be
an
angel
from
that
time
on
and
as
much
like
cousin
helen
as
she
could
and
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
all
out
of
sorts
and
as
fractious
as
a
bear
old
mary
said
that
she
got
out
of
bed
on
the
wrong
side
i
wonder
by
the
way
if
anybody
will
ever
be
wise
enough
to
tell
us
which
side
that
is
so
that
we
may
always
choose
the
other
how
comfortable
it
would
be
if
they
could
you
know
how
if
we
begin
the
day
in
a
cross
mood
all
sorts
of
unfortunate
accidents
seem
to
occur
to
add
to
our
vexations
the
very
first
thing
katy
did
this
morning
was
to
break
her
precious
vase
the
one
cousin
helen
had
given
her
it
was
standing
on
the
bureau
with
a
little
cluster
of
in
it
the
bureau
had
a
while
katy
was
brushing
her
hair
the
glass
tipped
a
little
so
that
she
could
not
see
at
a
moment
this
accident
would
have
troubled
her
much
but
being
out
of
temper
to
begin
with
it
made
her
angry
she
gave
the
glass
a
violent
push
the
lower
part
swung
forward
there
was
a
smash
and
the
first
thing
katy
knew
the
lay
scattered
all
over
the
floor
and
cousin
helen
pretty
present
was
ruined
katy
just
sat
down
on
the
carpet
and
cried
as
hard
as
if
she
had
been
phil
himself
aunt
izzie
heard
her
lamenting
and
came
in
i
very
sorry
she
said
picking
up
the
broken
glass
but
it
no
more
than
i
expected
you
so
careless
katy
now
do
sit
there
in
that
foolish
way
get
up
and
dress
yourself
you
be
late
to
breakfast
what
the
matter
asked
papa
noticing
katy
red
eyes
as
she
took
her
seat
at
the
table
i
broken
my
vase
said
katy
dolefully
it
was
extremely
careless
of
you
to
put
it
in
such
a
dangerous
place
said
her
aunt
you
might
have
known
that
the
glass
would
swing
and
knock
it
off
then
seeing
a
big
tear
fall
in
the
middle
of
plate
she
added
really
katy
you
too
big
to
behave
like
a
baby
why
dorry
would
be
ashamed
to
do
so
pray
control
yourself
this
snub
did
not
improve
katy
temper
she
went
on
with
her
breakfast
in
sulky
silence
what
are
you
all
going
to
do
asked
carr
hoping
to
give
things
a
more
cheerful
turn
swing
cried
john
and
dorry
both
together
alexander
put
us
up
a
splendid
one
in
the
no
you
not
said
aunt
izzie
in
a
positive
tone
the
swing
is
not
to
be
used
till
remember
that
children
not
till
and
not
then
unless
i
give
you
leave
this
was
unwise
of
aunt
izzie
she
would
better
have
explained
farther
the
truth
was
that
alexander
in
putting
up
the
swing
had
cracked
one
of
the
staples
which
fastened
it
to
the
roof
he
meant
to
get
a
new
one
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
meantime
he
had
cautioned
miss
carr
to
let
no
one
use
the
swing
because
it
really
was
not
safe
if
she
had
told
this
to
the
children
all
would
have
been
right
but
aunt
theory
was
that
young
people
must
obey
their
elders
without
explanation
john
and
elsie
and
dorry
all
pouted
when
they
heard
this
order
elsie
recovered
her
first
i
do
care
she
said
i
going
to
be
very
busy
i
got
to
write
a
letter
to
cousin
helen
about
somefing
elsie
never
could
quite
pronounce
the
what
asked
clover
oh
somefing
answered
elsie
wagging
her
head
mysteriously
none
of
the
rest
of
you
must
know
cousin
helen
said
so
it
a
secret
she
and
me
has
got
i
do
believe
cousin
helen
said
so
at
all
said
katy
crossly
she
would
tell
secrets
to
a
silly
little
girl
like
you
yes
she
would
too
retorted
elsie
angrily
she
said
i
was
just
as
good
to
trust
as
if
i
was
ever
so
big
and
she
said
i
was
her
pet
so
there
katy
carr
stop
disputing
said
aunt
izzie
katy
your
is
all
out
of
order
i
never
saw
anything
look
so
badly
go
up
stairs
at
once
and
straighten
it
before
you
do
anything
else
children
you
must
keep
in
the
shade
this
morning
it
too
hot
for
you
to
be
running
about
in
the
sun
elsie
go
into
the
kitchen
and
tell
debby
i
want
to
speak
to
her
yes
said
elsie
in
an
important
tone
and
afterwards
i
coming
back
to
write
my
letter
to
cousin
helen
katy
went
slowly
up
stairs
dragging
one
foot
after
the
other
it
was
a
warm
languid
day
her
head
ached
a
little
and
her
eyes
smarted
and
felt
heavy
from
crying
so
much
everything
seemed
dull
and
hateful
she
said
to
herself
that
aunt
izzie
was
very
unkind
to
make
her
work
in
vacation
and
she
pulled
the
open
with
a
disgusted
groan
it
must
be
confessed
that
miss
izzie
was
right
a
could
hardly
look
worse
than
this
one
did
it
reminded
one
of
the
white
knight
recipe
for
a
pudding
which
began
with
and
ended
with
and
gunpowder
all
sorts
of
things
were
mixed
together
as
if
somebody
had
put
in
a
long
stick
and
stirred
them
well
up
there
were
books
and
and
bits
of
scribbled
paper
and
and
brushes
had
come
unrolled
and
twisted
themselves
about
and
ends
of
ribbon
and
linen
collars
ruffles
all
crushed
out
of
shape
stuck
up
from
under
the
heavier
things
and
sundry
little
paper
boxes
lay
empty
on
top
the
treasures
they
once
held
having
sifted
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
drawer
and
disappeared
beneath
the
general
mass
it
took
much
time
and
patience
to
bring
order
out
of
this
confusion
but
katy
knew
that
aunt
izzie
would
be
up
by
and
by
and
she
dared
not
stop
till
all
was
done
by
the
time
it
was
finished
she
was
very
tired
going
down
stairs
she
met
elsie
coming
up
with
a
slate
in
her
hand
which
as
soon
as
she
saw
katy
she
put
behind
her
you
must
look
she
said
it
my
letter
to
cousin
helen
nobody
but
me
knows
the
secret
it
all
written
and
i
going
to

to
the
office

there
a
stamp
on
it
and
she
exhibited
a
corner
of
the
slate
sure
enough
there
was
a
stamp
stuck
on
the
frame
you
little
goose

katy
impatiently

said
katy
giving
her
a
vindictive
push
elsie
slipped
screamed
caught
at
the
banisters
missed
them
and
rolling
over
and
over
fell
with
a
thump
on
the
hall
floor
it
was
much
of
a
fall
only
steps
but
the
bump
was
a
hard
one
and
elsie
roared
as
if
she
had
been
half
killed
aunt
izzie
and
mary
came
rushing
to
the
spot
katy
pushed
me
sobbed
elsie
she
wanted
me
to
tell
her
my
secret
and
i
would
she
a
bad
naughty
girl
well
katy
carr
i
think
you
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
aunt
izzie
wreaking
your
temper
on
your
poor
little
sister
i
think
your
cousin
helen
will
be
surprised
when
she
hears
this
there
there
elsie
do
cry
any
more
dear
come
up
stairs
with
me
i
put
on
some
arnica
and
katy
hurt
you
again
so
they
went
up
stairs
katy
left
below
felt
very
miserable
repentant
defiant
discontented
and
sulky
all
at
once
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
she
had
not
meant
to
hurt
elsie
but
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
that
push
but
aunt
izzie
hint
about
telling
cousin
helen
had
made
her
too
angry
to
allow
of
her
confessing
this
to
herself
or
anybody
else
i
do
care
she
murmured
choking
back
her
tears
elsie
is
a
real
anyway
and
aunt
izzie
always
takes
her
part
just
because
i
told
the
little
silly
not
to
go
and
send
a
great
heavy
slate
to
the
she
went
out
by
the
into
the
yard
as
she
passed
the
shed
the
new
swing
caught
her
eye
how
exactly
like
aunt
izzie
she
thought
ordering
the
children
not
to
swing
till
she
gives
them
leave
i
suppose
she
thinks
it
too
hot
or
something
mind
her
anyhow
she
seated
herself
in
the
swing
it
was
a
one
with
a
broad
comfortable
seat
and
thick
new
ropes
the
seat
hung
just
the
right
distance
from
the
floor
alexander
was
a
capital
hand
at
putting
up
swings
and
the
the
nicest
possible
spot
in
which
to
have
one
it
was
a
big
place
with
a
very
high
roof
there
was
not
much
wood
left
in
it
just
now
and
the
little
there
was
was
piled
neatly
about
the
sides
of
the
shed
so
as
to
leave
plenty
of
room
the
place
felt
cool
and
dark
and
the
motion
of
the
swing
seemed
to
set
the
breeze
blowing
it
waved
katy
hair
like
a
great
fan
and
made
her
dreamy
and
quiet
all
sorts
of
sleepy
ideas
began
to
flit
through
her
brain
swinging
to
and
fro
like
the
pendulum
of
a
great
clock
she
gradually
rose
higher
and
higher
driving
herself
along
by
the
motion
of
her
body
and
striking
the
floor
smartly
with
her
foot
at
every
sweep
now
she
was
at
the
top
of
the
high
arched
door
then
she
could
almost
touch
the
above
it
and
through
the
small
square
window
could
see
pigeons
sitting
and
pluming
themselves
on
the
eaves
of
the
barn
and
white
clouds
blowing
over
the
blue
sky
she
had
never
swung
so
high
before
it
was
like
flying
she
thought
and
she
bent
and
curved
more
strongly
in
the
seat
trying
to
send
herself
yet
higher
and
graze
the
roof
with
her
toes
suddenly
at
the
very
highest
point
of
the
sweep
there
was
a
sharp
noise
of
cracking
the
swing
gave
a
violent
twist
spun
half
round
and
tossed
katy
into
the
air
she
clutched
the
rope
felt
it
dragged
from
her
grasp
then
down
down
down
she
fell
all
grew
dark
and
she
knew
no
more
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
clover
was
kneeling
beside
her
with
a
pale
scared
face
and
aunt
izzie
was
dropping
something
cold
and
wet
on
her
forehead
what
the
matter
said
katy
faintly
oh
she
alive
she
alive
and
clover
put
her
arms
round
neck
and
sobbed
hush
dear
aunt
izzie
voice
sounded
unusually
gentle
you
had
a
bad
tumble
katy
do
you
recollect
a
tumble
oh
yes
out
of
the
swing
said
katy
as
it
all
came
slowly
back
to
her
did
the
rope
break
aunt
izzie
i
ca
remember
about
it
no
katy
not
the
rope
the
staple
drew
out
of
the
roof
it
was
a
cracked
one
and
not
safe
do
you
recollect
my
telling
you
not
to
swing
did
you
forget
no
aunt
izzie
i
did
forget
i
but
here
katy
broke
down
she
closed
her
eyes
and
big
tears
rolled
from
under
the
lids
do
cry
whispered
clover
crying
herself
please
do
aunt
izzie
is
going
to
scold
you
but
katy
was
too
weak
and
shaken
not
to
cry
i
think
i
like
to
go
up
stairs
and
lie
on
the
bed
she
said
but
when
she
tried
to
get
off
the
sofa
everything
swam
before
her
and
she
fell
back
again
on
the
pillow
why
i
ca
stand
up
she
gasped
looking
very
much
frightened
i
afraid
you
given
yourself
a
sprain
somewhere
said
aunt
izzie
who
looked
rather
frightened
herself
you
better
lie
still
a
while
dear
before
you
try
to
move
ah
here
the
doctor
well
i
am
glad
and
she
went
forward
to
meet
him
it
was
papa
but
alsop
who
lived
quite
near
them
i
am
so
relieved
that
you
could
come
aunt
izzie
said
my
brother
is
gone
out
of
town
not
to
return
till
and
one
of
the
little
girls
has
had
a
bad
fall
alsop
sat
down
beside
the
sofa
and
counted
katy
pulse
then
he
began
feeling
all
over
her
can
you
move
this
leg
he
asked
katy
gave
a
feeble
kick
and
this
the
kick
was
a
good
deal
more
feeble
did
that
hurt
you
asked
alsop
seeing
a
look
of
pain
on
her
face
yes
a
little
replied
katy
trying
hard
not
to
cry
in
your
back
eh
was
the
pain
high
up
or
low
down
and
the
doctor
punched
katy
spine
for
some
minutes
making
her
squirm
uneasily
i
afraid
she
done
some
mischief
he
said
at
last
but
impossible
to
tell
yet
exactly
what
it
may
be
only
a
twist
or
a
slight
sprain
he
added
seeing
the
look
of
terror
on
katy
face
better
get
her
up
stairs
and
undress
her
as
soon
as
you
can
miss
carr
i
leave
a
prescription
to
rub
her
with
and
alsop
took
out
a
bit
of
paper
and
began
to
write
oh
must
i
go
to
bed
said
katy
how
long
will
i
have
to
stay
there
doctor
that
depends
on
how
fast
you
get
well
replied
the
doctor
not
long
i
hope
perhaps
only
a
few
days
a
few
days
repeated
katy
in
a
despairing
tone
after
the
doctor
was
gone
aunt
izzie
and
debby
lifted
katy
and
carried
her
slowly
up
stairs
it
was
not
easy
for
every
motion
hurt
her
and
the
sense
of
being
helpless
hurt
most
of
all
she
could
help
crying
after
she
was
undressed
and
put
into
bed
it
all
seemed
so
dreadful
and
strange
if
only
papa
was
here
she
thought
but
carr
had
gone
into
the
country
to
see
somebody
who
was
very
sick
and
could
possibly
be
back
till
such
a
long
long
afternoon
as
that
was
aunt
izzie
sent
up
some
dinner
but
katy
could
eat
her
lips
were
parched
and
her
head
ached
violently
the
sun
began
to
pour
in
the
room
grew
warm
flies
buzzed
in
the
window
and
tormented
her
by
lighting
on
her
face
little
prickles
of
pain
ran
up
and
down
her
back
she
lay
with
her
eyes
shut
because
it
hurt
to
keep
them
open
and
all
sorts
of
uneasy
thoughts
went
rushing
through
her
mind
perhaps
if
my
back
is
really
sprained
i
shall
have
to
lie
here
as
much
as
a
week
she
said
to
herself
oh
dear
dear
i
the
vacation
is
only
eight
weeks
and
i
was
going
to
do
such
lovely
things
how
can
people
be
as
patient
as
cousin
helen
when
they
have
to
lie
still
wo
she
be
sorry
when
she
hears
was
it
really
yesterday
that
she
went
away
it
seems
a
year
if
only
i
had
got
into
that
nasty
old
swing
and
then
katy
began
to
imagine
how
it
would
have
been
if
she
and
how
she
and
clover
had
meant
to
go
to
paradise
that
afternoon
they
might
have
been
there
under
the
cool
trees
now
as
these
thoughts
ran
through
her
mind
her
head
grew
hotter
and
her
position
in
the
bed
more
uncomfortable
suddenly
she
became
conscious
that
the
glaring
light
from
the
window
was
shaded
and
that
the
wind
seemed
to
be
blowing
freshly
over
her
she
opened
her
heavy
eyes
the
blinds
were
shut
and
there
beside
the
bed
sat
little
elsie
fanning
her
with
a
fan
did
i
wake
you
up
katy
she
asked
in
a
timid
voice
katy
looked
at
her
with
startled
amazed
eyes
do
be
frightened
said
elsie
i
wo
disturb
you
johnnie
and
me
are
so
sorry
you
sick
and
her
little
lips
trembled
but
we
mean
to
keep
real
quiet
and
never
bang
the
nursery
door
or
make
noises
on
the
stairs
till
you
well
again
and
i
brought
you
somefing
real
nice
some
of
it
from
john
and
some
from
me
it
because
you
got
tumbled
out
of
the
swing
see
and
elsie
pointed
triumphantly
to
a
chair
which
she
had
pulled
up
close
to
the
bed
and
on
which
were
solemnly
set
forth
a
pewter
a
box
with
a
glass
lid
on
which
flowers
were
painted
a
jointed
doll
a
transparent
slate
and
lastly
two
new
lead
pencils
they
all
yours
yours
to
keep
said
generous
little
elsie
you
can
have
pikery
too
if
you
want
only
he
pretty
big
and
afraid
he
be
lonely
without
me
do
you
like
the
fings
katy
they
real
pretty
it
seemed
to
katy
as
if
the
hottest
sort
of
a
coal
of
fire
was
burning
into
the
top
of
her
head
as
she
looked
at
the
treasures
on
the
chair
and
then
at
elsie
face
all
lighted
up
with
affectionate
she
tried
to
speak
but
began
to
cry
instead
which
frightened
elsie
very
much
does
it
hurt
you
so
bad
she
asked
crying
too
from
sympathy
oh
no
it
is
that
sobbed
katy
but
i
was
so
cross
to
you
this
morning
elsie
and
pushed
you
oh
please
forgive
me
please
do
why
it
got
well
said
elsie
surprised
aunt
izzie
put
a
fing
out
of
a
bottle
on
it
and
the
bump
all
went
away
shall
i
go
and
ask
her
to
put
some
on
you
too
i
will
and
she
ran
toward
the
door
oh
no
cried
katy
do
go
away
elsie
come
here
and
kiss
me
instead
elsie
turned
as
if
doubtful
whether
this
invitation
could
be
meant
for
her
katy
held
out
her
arms
elsie
ran
right
into
them
and
the
big
sister
and
the
little
exchanged
an
embrace
which
seemed
to
bring
their
hearts
closer
together
than
they
had
ever
been
before
you
the
most
little
darling
murmured
katy
clasping
elsie
tight
i
been
real
horrid
to
you
elsie
but
i
never
be
again
you
shall
play
with
me
and
clover
and
cecy
just
as
much
as
you
like
and
write
notes
in
all
the
and
everything
else
oh
goody
goody
cried
elsie
executing
little
skips
of
transport
how
sweet
you
are
katy
i
mean
to
love
you
next
best
to
cousin
helen
and
papa
and
racking
her
brains
for
some
way
of
repaying
this
wonderful
kindness
i
tell
you
the
secret
if
you
want
me
to
much
i
guess
cousin
helen
would
let
me
no
said
katy
never
mind
about
the
secret
i
do
want
you
to
tell
it
to
me
sit
down
by
the
bed
and
fan
me
some
more
instead
no
persisted
elsie
who
now
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
part
with
the
treasured
secret
could
not
bear
to
be
stopped
cousin
helen
gave
me
a
and
told
me
to
give
it
to
debby
and
tell
her
she
was
much
obliged
to
her
for
making
her
such
nice
things
to
eat
and
i
did
and
debby
was
real
pleased
and
i
wrote
cousin
helen
a
letter
and
told
her
that
debby
liked
the
that
the
secret
is
it
a
nice
one
only
you
must
tell
anybody
about
it
ever
just
as
long
as
you
live
no
said
katy
smiling
faintly
i
wo
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
elsie
sat
beside
the
bed
with
her
fan
keeping
off
the
flies
and
shue
away
the
other
children
when
they
peeped
in
at
the
door
do
you
really
like
to
have
me
here
she
asked
more
than
once
and
smiled
oh
triumphantly
when
katy
said
yes
but
though
katy
said
yes
i
am
afraid
it
was
only
half
the
truth
for
the
sight
of
the
dear
little
forgiving
girl
whom
she
had
treated
unkindly
gave
her
more
pain
than
pleasure
i
be
good
to
her
when
i
get
well
she
thought
to
herself
tossing
uneasily
to
and
fro
aunt
izzie
slept
in
her
room
that
night
katy
was
feverish
when
morning
came
and
carr
returned
he
found
her
in
a
good
deal
of
pain
hot
and
restless
with
anxious
eyes
papa
she
cried
the
first
thing
must
i
lie
here
as
much
as
a
week
my
darling
i
afraid
you
must
replied
her
father
who
looked
worried
and
very
grave
dear
dear
sobbed
katy
how
can
i
bear
it
chapter
ix
dismal
days
if
anybody
had
told
katy
that
first
afternoon
that
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
would
still
be
in
bed
and
in
pain
and
with
no
time
fixed
for
getting
up
i
think
it
would
have
almost
killed
her
she
was
so
restless
and
eager
that
to
lie
still
seemed
one
of
the
hardest
things
in
the
world
but
to
lie
still
and
have
her
back
ache
all
the
time
was
worse
yet
day
after
day
she
asked
papa
with
quivering
lip
may
i
get
up
and
go
down
stairs
this
morning
and
when
he
shook
his
head
the
lip
would
quiver
more
and
tears
would
come
but
if
she
tried
to
get
up
it
hurt
her
so
much
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
glad
to
sink
back
again
on
the
soft
pillows
and
mattress
which
felt
so
comfortable
to
her
poor
bones
then
there
came
a
time
when
katy
did
even
ask
to
be
allowed
to
get
up
a
time
when
sharp
dreadful
pain
such
as
she
never
imagined
before
took
hold
of
her
when
days
and
nights
got
all
confused
and
tangled
up
together
and
aunt
izzie
never
seemed
to
go
to
bed
a
time
when
papa
was
constantly
in
her
room
when
other
doctors
came
and
stood
over
her
and
punched
and
felt
her
back
and
talked
to
each
other
in
low
whispers
it
was
all
like
a
long
bad
dream
from
which
she
could
wake
up
though
she
tried
ever
so
hard
now
and
then
she
would
rouse
a
little
and
catch
the
sound
of
voices
or
be
aware
that
clover
or
elsie
stood
at
the
door
crying
softly
or
that
aunt
izzie
in
creaking
slippers
was
going
about
the
room
on
tiptoe
then
all
these
things
would
slip
away
again
and
she
would
drop
off
into
a
dark
place
where
there
was
nothing
but
pain
and
sleep
which
made
her
forget
pain
and
so
seemed
the
best
thing
in
the
world
we
will
hurry
over
this
time
for
it
is
hard
to
think
of
our
bright
katy
in
such
a
sad
plight
by
and
by
the
pain
grew
less
and
the
sleep
quieter
then
as
the
pain
became
easier
still
katy
woke
up
as
it
were
began
to
take
notice
of
what
was
going
on
about
her
to
put
questions
how
long
have
i
been
sick
she
asked
one
morning
it
is
four
weeks
yesterday
said
papa
four
weeks
said
katy
why
i
did
know
it
was
so
long
as
that
was
i
very
sick
papa
very
dear
but
you
are
a
great
deal
better
now
how
did
i
hurt
me
when
i
tumbled
out
of
the
swing
asked
katy
who
was
in
an
unusually
wakeful
mood
i
do
believe
i
could
make
you
understand
dear
but
try
papa
well
did
you
know
that
you
had
a
long
bone
down
your
back
called
a
spine
i
thought
that
was
a
disease
said
katy
clover
said
that
cousin
helen
had
the
spine
no
the
spine
is
a
bone
it
is
made
up
of
a
row
of
smaller
bones
or
knobs
and
in
the
middle
of
it
is
a
sort
of
rope
of
nerves
called
the
spinal
cord
nerves
you
know
are
the
things
we
feel
with
well
this
spinal
cord
is
rolled
up
for
safe
keeping
in
a
soft
wrapping
called
membrane
when
you
fell
out
of
the
swing
you
struck
against
one
of
these
knobs
and
bruised
the
membrane
inside
and
the
nerve
inflamed
and
gave
you
a
fever
in
the
back
do
you
see
a
little
said
katy
not
quite
understanding
but
too
tired
to
question
farther
after
she
had
rested
a
while
she
said
is
the
fever
well
now
papa
can
i
get
up
again
and
go
down
stairs
right
away
not
right
away
i
afraid
said
carr
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
katy
did
ask
any
more
questions
then
another
week
passed
and
another
the
pain
was
almost
gone
it
only
came
back
now
and
then
for
a
few
minutes
she
could
sleep
now
and
eat
and
be
raised
in
bed
without
feeling
giddy
but
still
the
once
active
limbs
hung
heavy
and
lifeless
and
she
was
not
able
to
walk
or
even
stand
alone
my
legs
feel
so
queer
she
said
one
morning
they
are
just
like
the
prince
legs
which
were
turned
to
black
marble
in
the
arabian
nights
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
reason
papa
wo
they
feel
natural
soon
not
soon
answered
carr
then
he
said
to
himself
poor
child
she
had
better
know
the
truth
so
he
went
on
aloud
i
am
afraid
my
darling
that
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
stay
in
bed
a
long
time
how
long
said
katy
looking
frightened
a
month
more
i
ca
tell
exactly
how
long
answered
her
father
the
doctors
think
as
i
do
that
the
injury
to
your
spine
is
one
which
you
will
outgrow
by
and
by
because
you
are
so
young
and
strong
but
it
may
take
a
good
while
to
do
it
it
may
be
that
you
will
have
to
lie
here
for
months
or
it
may
be
more
the
only
cure
for
such
a
hurt
is
time
and
patience
it
is
hard
darling
for
katy
began
to
sob
wildly
but
you
have
hope
to
help
you
along
think
of
poor
cousin
helen
bearing
all
these
years
without
hope
oh
papa
gasped
katy
between
her
sobs
does
it
seem
dreadful
that
just
getting
into
the
swing
for
a
few
minutes
should
do
so
much
harm
such
a
little
thing
as
that
yes
such
a
little
thing
repeated
carr
sadly
and
it
was
only
a
little
thing
too
forgetting
aunt
izzie
order
about
the
swing
just
for
the
want
of
the
small
nail
of
obedience
katy
years
afterwards
katy
told
somebody
that
the
longest
six
weeks
of
her
life
were
those
which
followed
this
conversation
with
papa
now
that
she
knew
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
well
at
once
the
days
dragged
dreadfully
each
seemed
duller
and
dismaller
than
the
day
before
she
lost
heart
about
herself
and
took
no
interest
in
anything
aunt
izzie
brought
her
books
but
she
did
want
to
read
or
to
sew
nothing
amused
her
clover
and
cecy
would
come
and
sit
with
her
but
hearing
them
tell
about
their
plays
and
the
things
they
had
been
doing
made
her
cry
so
miserably
that
aunt
izzie
would
let
them
come
often
they
were
very
sorry
for
katy
but
the
room
was
so
gloomy
and
katy
so
cross
that
they
did
mind
much
not
being
allowed
to
see
her
in
those
days
katy
made
aunt
izzie
keep
the
blinds
shut
tight
and
she
lay
in
the
dark
thinking
how
miserable
she
was
and
how
wretched
all
the
rest
of
her
life
was
going
to
be
everybody
was
very
kind
and
patient
with
her
but
she
was
too
selfishly
miserable
to
notice
it
aunt
izzie
ran
up
and
down
stairs
and
was
on
her
feet
all
day
trying
to
get
something
which
would
please
her
but
katy
hardly
said
thank
you
and
never
saw
how
tired
aunt
izzie
looked
so
long
as
she
was
forced
to
stay
in
bed
katy
could
not
be
grateful
for
anything
that
was
done
for
her
but
doleful
as
the
days
were
they
were
not
so
bad
as
the
nights
when
after
aunt
izzie
was
asleep
katy
would
lie
wide
awake
and
have
long
hopeless
fits
of
crying
at
these
times
she
would
think
of
all
the
plans
she
had
made
for
doing
beautiful
things
when
she
was
grown
up
and
now
i
shall
never
do
any
of
them
she
would
say
to
herself
only
just
lie
here
papa
says
i
may
get
well
by
and
by
but
i
i
know
i
and
even
if
i
do
i
shall
have
wasted
all
these
years
and
the
others
will
grow
up
and
get
ahead
of
me
and
i
be
a
comfort
to
them
or
to
anybody
else
oh
dear
oh
dear
how
dreadful
it
is
the
first
thing
which
broke
in
upon
this
sad
state
of
affairs
was
a
letter
from
cousin
helen
which
papa
brought
one
morning
and
handed
to
aunt
izzie
helen
tells
me
she
going
home
this
week
said
aunt
izzie
from
the
window
where
she
had
gone
to
read
the
letter
well
i
sorry
but
i
think
she
quite
right
not
to
stop
it
just
as
she
says
one
invalid
at
a
time
is
enough
in
a
house
i
sure
i
have
my
hands
full
with
katy
oh
aunt
izzie
cried
katy
is
cousin
helen
coming
this
way
when
she
goes
home
oh
do
make
her
stop
if
it
just
for
one
day
do
ask
her
i
want
to
see
her
so
much
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
wo
you
please
please
dear
papa
she
was
almost
crying
with
eagerness
why
yes
darling
if
you
wish
it
so
much
said
carr
it
will
cost
aunt
izzie
some
trouble
but
she
so
kind
that
i
sure
manage
it
if
it
is
to
give
you
so
much
pleasure
ca
you
izzie
and
he
looked
eagerly
at
his
sister
of
course
i
will
said
miss
izzie
heartily
katy
was
so
glad
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
threw
her
arms
of
her
own
accord
round
aunt
izzie
neck
and
kissed
her
thank
you
dear
aunty
she
said
aunt
izzie
looked
as
pleased
as
could
be
she
had
a
warm
heart
hidden
under
her
fidgety
ways
only
katy
had
never
been
sick
before
to
find
it
out
for
the
next
week
katy
was
feverish
with
expectation
at
last
cousin
helen
came
this
time
katy
was
not
on
the
steps
to
welcome
her
but
after
a
little
while
papa
brought
cousin
helen
in
his
arms
and
sat
her
in
a
big
chair
beside
the
bed
how
dark
it
is
she
said
after
they
had
kissed
each
other
and
talked
for
a
minute
or
two
i
ca
see
your
face
at
all
would
it
hurt
your
eyes
to
have
a
little
more
light
oh
no
answered
katy
it
do
hurt
my
eyes
only
i
hate
to
have
the
sun
come
in
it
makes
me
feel
worse
somehow
push
the
blind
open
a
little
bit
then
clover
and
clover
did
so
now
i
can
see
said
cousin
helen
it
was
a
child
enough
which
she
saw
lying
before
her
katy
face
had
grown
thin
and
her
eyes
had
red
circles
about
them
from
continual
crying
her
hair
had
been
brushed
twice
that
morning
by
aunt
izzie
but
katy
had
run
her
fingers
impatiently
through
it
till
it
stood
out
above
her
head
like
a
frowsy
bush
she
wore
a
calico
which
though
clean
was
particularly
ugly
in
pattern
and
the
room
for
all
its
tidiness
had
a
dismal
look
with
the
chairs
set
up
against
the
wall
and
a
row
of
on
the
is
it
horrid
sighed
katy
as
cousin
helen
looked
around
everything
horrid
but
i
do
mind
so
much
now
that
you
come
oh
cousin
helen
i
had
such
a
dreadful
time
i
know
said
her
cousin
pityingly
i
heard
all
about
it
katy
and
i
so
very
sorry
for
you
it
is
a
hard
trial
my
poor
darling
but
how
do
do
it
cried
katy
how
do
you
manage
to
be
so
sweet
and
beautiful
and
patient
when
feeling
badly
all
the
time
and
ca
do
anything
or
walk
or
stand
her
voice
was
lost
in
sobs
cousin
helen
did
say
anything
for
a
little
while
she
just
sat
and
stroked
katy
hand
katy
she
said
at
last
has
papa
told
you
that
he
thinks
you
are
going
to
get
well
by
and
by
yes
replied
katy
he
did
say
so
but
perhaps
it
wo
be
for
a
long
long
time
and
i
wanted
to
do
so
many
things
and
now
i
ca
do
anything
at
all
what
sort
of
things
study
and
help
people
and
become
famous
and
i
wanted
to
teach
the
children
mamma
said
i
must
take
care
of
them
and
i
meant
to
and
now
i
ca
go
to
school
or
learn
anything
myself
and
if
i
ever
do
get
well
the
children
will
be
almost
grown
up
and
they
wo
need
me
but
why
must
you
wait
till
you
get
well
asked
cousin
helen
smiling
why
cousin
helen
what
can
i
do
lying
here
in
bed
a
good
deal
shall
i
tell
you
katy
what
it
seems
to
me
that
i
should
say
to
myself
if
i
were
in
your
place
yes
please
replied
katy
wonderingly
i
should
say
this
katy
carr
you
wanted
to
go
to
school
and
learn
to
be
wise
and
useful
and
here
a
chance
for
you
god
is
going
to
let
you
go
to
school
where
he
teaches
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
to
people
perhaps
he
will
only
keep
you
for
one
term
or
perhaps
it
may
be
for
three
or
four
but
whichever
it
is
you
must
make
the
very
most
of
the
chance
because
he
gives
it
to
you
himself
but
what
is
the
school
asked
katy
i
do
know
what
you
mean
it
is
called
the
school
of
pain
replied
cousin
helen
with
her
sweetest
smile
and
the
place
where
the
lessons
are
to
be
learned
is
this
room
of
yours
the
rules
of
the
school
are
pretty
hard
but
the
good
scholars
who
keep
them
best
find
out
after
a
while
how
right
and
kind
they
are
and
the
lessons
are
easy
either
but
the
more
you
study
the
more
interesting
they
become
what
are
the
lessons
asked
katy
getting
interested
and
beginning
to
feel
as
if
cousin
helen
were
telling
her
a
story
well
there
the
lesson
of
patience
that
one
of
the
hardest
studies
you
ca
learn
much
of
it
at
a
time
but
every
bit
you
get
by
heart
makes
the
next
bit
easier
and
there
the
lesson
of
cheerfulness
and
the
lesson
of
making
the
best
of
things
sometimes
there
is
anything
to
make
the
best
of
remarked
katy
dolefully
yes
there
is
always
everything
in
the
world
has
two
handles
you
know
that
one
is
a
smooth
handle
if
you
take
hold
of
it
the
thing
comes
up
lightly
and
easily
but
if
you
seize
the
rough
handle
it
hurts
your
hand
and
the
thing
is
hard
to
lift
some
people
always
manage
to
get
hold
of
the
wrong
handle
is
aunt
izzie
a
asked
katy
cousin
helen
was
glad
to
hear
her
laugh
yes
aunt
izzie
is
a
and
she
has
a
nice
pleasant
handle
too
if
you
just
try
to
find
it
and
the
children
are
also
in
one
sense
all
their
handles
are
different
you
know
human
beings
made
just
alike
like
red
we
have
to
feel
and
guess
before
we
can
make
out
just
how
other
people
go
and
how
we
ought
to
take
hold
of
them
it
is
very
interesting
i
advise
you
to
try
it
and
while
you
are
trying
you
will
learn
all
sorts
of
things
which
will
help
you
to
help
others
if
i
only
could
sighed
katy
are
there
any
other
studies
in
the
school
cousin
helen
yes
there
the
lesson
of
hopefulness
that
class
has
ever
so
many
teachers
the
sun
is
one
he
sits
outside
the
window
all
day
waiting
a
chance
to
slip
in
and
get
at
his
pupil
he
a
teacher
too
i
would
shut
him
out
if
i
were
you
every
morning
the
first
thing
when
i
woke
up
i
would
say
to
myself
am
going
to
get
well
so
papa
thinks
perhaps
it
may
be
so
in
case
this
be
the
last
day
of
my
sickness
let
me
spend
it
and
make
my
so
pleasant
that
everybody
will
like
to
remember
it
then
there
is
one
more
lesson
katy
the
lesson
of
neatness
must
be
kept
in
order
you
know
a
sick
person
ought
to
be
as
fresh
and
dainty
as
a
rose
but
it
is
such
a
fuss
pleaded
katy
i
do
believe
you
any
idea
what
a
bother
it
is
to
always
be
nice
and
in
order
you
never
were
careless
like
me
cousin
helen
you
were
born
neat
oh
was
i
said
her
cousin
well
katy
we
wo
dispute
that
point
but
i
tell
you
a
story
if
you
like
about
a
girl
i
once
knew
who
born
neat
oh
do
cried
katy
enchanted
cousin
helen
had
done
her
good
already
she
looked
brighter
and
less
listless
than
for
days
this
girl
was
quite
young
continued
cousin
helen
she
was
strong
and
active
and
liked
to
run
and
climb
and
ride
and
do
all
sorts
of
jolly
things
one
day
something
happened
an
accident
and
they
told
her
that
all
the
rest
of
her
life
she
had
got
to
lie
on
her
back
and
suffer
pain
and
never
walk
any
more
or
do
any
of
the
things
she
enjoyed
most
just
like
you
and
me
whispered
katy
squeezing
cousin
helen
hand
something
like
me
but
not
so
much
like
you
because
you
know
we
hope
are
going
to
get
well
one
of
these
days
the
girl
did
mind
it
so
much
when
they
first
told
her
for
she
was
so
ill
that
she
felt
sure
she
should
die
but
when
she
got
better
and
began
to
think
of
the
long
life
which
lay
before
her
that
was
worse
than
ever
the
pain
had
been
she
was
so
wretched
that
she
did
care
what
became
of
anything
or
how
anything
looked
she
had
no
aunt
izzie
to
look
after
things
so
her
room
soon
got
into
a
dreadful
state
it
was
full
of
dust
and
confusion
and
dirty
spoons
and
phials
of
physic
she
kept
the
blinds
shut
and
let
her
hair
tangle
every
which
way
and
altogether
was
a
dismal
spectacle
this
girl
had
a
dear
old
father
went
on
cousin
helen
who
used
to
come
every
day
and
sit
beside
her
bed
one
morning
he
said
to
her
daughter
i
afraid
you
got
to
live
in
this
room
for
a
long
time
now
there
one
thing
i
want
you
to
do
for
my
sake
that
she
asked
surprised
to
hear
there
was
anything
left
which
she
could
for
anybody
want
you
to
turn
out
all
these
physic
bottles
and
make
your
room
pleasant
and
pretty
for
to
come
and
sit
in
you
see
i
shall
spend
a
good
deal
of
my
time
here
now
i
do
like
dust
and
darkness
i
like
to
see
flowers
on
the
table
and
sunshine
in
at
the
window
will
you
do
this
to
please
me
said
the
girl
but
she
gave
a
sigh
and
i
am
afraid
she
felt
as
if
it
was
going
to
be
a
dreadful
trouble
another
thing
continued
her
father
want
to
look
pretty
ca
nightgowns
and
wrappers
be
trimmed
and
made
becoming
just
as
much
as
dresses
a
sick
woman
who
is
neat
is
a
disagreeable
object
do
to
please
me
send
for
something
pretty
and
let
me
see
you
looking
nice
again
i
ca
bear
to
have
my
helen
turn
into
a
slattern
helen
exclaimed
katy
with
eyes
was
it
yes
said
her
cousin
smiling
it
was
i
though
i
did
mean
to
let
the
name
slip
out
so
soon
so
after
my
father
was
gone
away
i
sent
for
a
such
a
sight
katy
my
hair
was
a
perfect
mouse
nest
and
i
had
frowned
so
much
that
my
forehead
was
all
with
lines
of
pain
till
it
looked
like
an
old
woman
katy
stared
at
cousin
helen
smooth
brow
and
glossy
hair
i
believe
it
she
said
your
hair
never
could
be
rough
yes
it
was
worse
a
great
deal
than
yours
looks
now
but
that
peep
in
the
glass
did
me
good
i
began
to
think
how
selfishly
i
was
behaving
and
to
desire
to
do
better
and
after
that
when
the
pain
came
on
i
used
to
lie
and
keep
my
forehead
smooth
with
my
fingers
and
try
not
to
let
my
face
show
what
i
was
enduring
so
by
and
by
the
wrinkles
wore
away
and
though
i
am
a
good
deal
older
now
they
have
never
come
back
it
was
a
great
deal
of
trouble
at
first
to
have
to
think
and
plan
to
keep
my
room
and
myself
looking
nice
but
after
a
while
it
grew
to
be
a
habit
and
then
it
became
easy
and
the
pleasure
it
gave
my
dear
father
repaid
for
all
he
had
been
proud
of
his
active
healthy
girl
but
i
think
she
was
never
such
a
comfort
to
him
as
his
sick
one
lying
there
in
her
bed
my
room
was
his
favorite
and
he
spent
so
much
time
there
that
now
the
room
and
everything
in
it
makes
me
think
of
him
there
were
tears
in
cousin
helen
eyes
as
she
ceased
speaking
but
katy
looked
bright
and
eager
it
seemed
somehow
to
be
a
help
as
well
as
a
great
surprise
that
ever
there
should
have
been
a
time
when
cousin
helen
was
less
perfect
than
she
was
now
do
you
really
think
i
could
do
so
too
she
asked
do
what
comb
your
hair
cousin
helen
was
smiling
now
oh
no
be
nice
and
sweet
and
patient
and
a
comfort
to
people
you
know
what
i
mean
i
am
sure
you
can
if
you
try
but
what
would
you
do
first
asked
katy
who
now
that
her
mind
had
grasped
a
new
idea
was
eager
to
begin
well
first
i
would
open
the
blinds
and
make
the
room
look
a
little
less
dismal
are
you
taking
all
those
medicines
in
the
bottles
now
no
only
that
big
one
with
the
blue
label
then
you
might
ask
aunt
izzy
to
take
away
the
others
and
i
get
clover
to
pick
a
bunch
of
fresh
flowers
every
day
for
your
table
by
the
way
i
do
see
the
little
white
vase
no
it
got
broken
the
very
day
after
you
went
away
the
day
i
fell
out
of
the
swing
said
katy
sorrowfully
never
mind
pet
do
look
so
doleful
i
know
the
tree
those
vases
grow
upon
and
you
shall
have
another
then
after
the
room
is
made
pleasant
i
would
have
all
my
fetched
up
if
i
were
you
and
i
would
study
a
couple
of
hours
every
morning
oh
cried
katy
making
a
wry
face
at
the
idea
cousin
helen
smiled
i
know
said
she
it
sounds
like
dull
work
learning
geography
and
doing
sums
up
here
all
by
yourself
but
i
think
if
you
make
the
effort
you
be
glad
by
and
by
you
wo
lose
so
much
ground
you
see
wo
slip
back
quite
so
far
in
your
education
and
then
studying
will
be
like
working
at
a
garden
where
things
do
grow
easily
every
flower
you
raise
will
be
a
sort
of
triumph
and
you
will
value
it
twice
as
much
as
a
common
flower
which
has
cost
no
trouble
well
said
katy
rather
forlornly
i
try
but
it
wo
be
a
bit
nice
studying
without
anybody
to
study
with
me
is
there
anything
else
cousin
helen
just
then
the
door
creaked
and
elsie
timidly
put
her
head
into
the
room
oh
elsie
run
away
cried
katy
cousin
helen
and
i
are
talking
do
come
just
now
katy
did
speak
unkindly
but
elsie
face
fell
and
she
looked
disappointed
she
said
nothing
however
but
shut
the
door
and
stole
away
cousin
helen
watched
this
little
scene
without
speaking
for
a
few
minutes
after
elsie
was
gone
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
katy
she
said
at
last
you
were
saying
just
now
that
one
of
the
things
you
were
sorry
about
was
that
while
you
were
ill
you
could
be
of
no
use
to
the
children
do
you
know
i
do
think
you
have
that
reason
for
being
sorry
why
not
said
katy
astonished
because
you
can
be
of
use
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
more
of
a
chance
with
the
children
now
than
you
ever
could
have
had
when
you
were
well
and
flying
about
as
you
used
you
might
do
almost
anything
you
liked
with
them
i
ca
think
what
you
mean
said
katy
sadly
why
cousin
helen
half
the
time
i
do
even
know
where
they
are
or
what
they
are
doing
and
i
ca
get
up
and
go
after
them
you
know
but
you
can
make
your
room
such
a
delightful
place
that
they
will
want
to
come
to
you
do
you
see
a
sick
person
has
one
splendid
chance
she
is
always
on
hand
everybody
who
wants
her
knows
just
where
to
go
if
people
love
her
she
gets
naturally
to
be
the
heart
of
the
house
once
make
the
little
ones
feel
that
your
room
is
the
place
of
all
others
to
come
to
when
they
are
tired
or
happy
or
grieved
or
sorry
about
anything
and
that
the
katy
who
lives
there
is
sure
to
give
them
a
loving
reception
and
the
battle
is
won
for
you
know
we
never
do
people
good
by
lecturing
only
by
living
their
lives
with
them
and
helping
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
to
make
them
better
and
when
one
own
life
is
laid
aside
for
a
while
as
yours
is
now
that
is
the
very
time
to
take
up
other
people
lives
as
we
ca
do
when
we
are
scurrying
and
bustling
over
our
own
affairs
but
i
did
mean
to
preach
a
sermon
i
afraid
you
tired
no
i
not
a
bit
said
katy
holding
cousin
helen
hand
tight
in
hers
you
ca
think
how
much
better
i
feel
oh
cousin
helen
i
will
try
it
wo
be
easy
replied
her
cousin
there
will
be
days
when
your
head
aches
and
you
feel
cross
and
fretted
and
do
want
to
think
of
any
one
but
yourself
and
there
be
other
days
when
clover
and
the
rest
will
come
in
as
elsie
did
just
now
and
you
will
be
doing
something
else
and
will
feel
as
if
their
coming
was
a
bother
but
you
must
recollect
that
every
time
you
forget
and
are
impatient
or
selfish
you
chill
them
and
drive
them
farther
away
they
are
loving
little
things
and
are
so
sorry
for
you
now
that
nothing
you
do
makes
them
angry
but
by
and
by
they
will
get
used
to
having
you
sick
and
if
you
have
won
them
as
friends
they
will
grow
away
from
you
as
they
get
older
just
then
carr
came
in
oh
papa
you
have
come
to
take
cousin
helen
have
you
cried
katy
indeed
i
have
said
her
father
i
think
the
big
invalid
and
the
little
invalid
have
talked
quite
long
enough
cousin
helen
looks
tired
for
a
minute
katy
felt
just
like
crying
but
she
choked
back
the
tears
my
first
lesson
in
patience
she
said
to
herself
and
managed
to
give
a
faint
watery
smile
as
papa
looked
at
her
that
right
dear
whispered
cousin
helen
as
she
bent
forward
to
kiss
her
and
one
last
word
katy
in
this
school
to
which
you
and
i
belong
there
is
one
great
comfort
and
that
is
that
the
teacher
is
always
at
hand
he
never
goes
away
if
things
puzzle
us
there
he
is
close
by
ready
to
explain
and
make
all
easy
try
to
think
of
this
darling
and
do
be
afraid
to
ask
him
for
help
if
the
lesson
seems
too
hard
katy
had
a
strange
dream
that
night
she
thought
she
was
trying
to
study
a
lesson
out
of
a
book
which
would
come
quite
open
she
could
just
see
a
little
bit
of
what
was
inside
but
it
was
in
a
language
which
she
did
not
understand
she
tried
in
vain
not
a
word
could
she
read
and
yet
for
all
that
it
looked
so
interesting
that
she
longed
to
go
on
oh
if
somebody
would
only
help
me
she
cried
impatiently
suddenly
a
hand
came
over
her
shoulder
and
took
hold
of
the
book
it
opened
at
once
and
showed
the
whole
page
and
then
the
forefinger
of
the
hand
began
to
point
to
line
after
line
and
as
it
moved
the
words
became
plain
and
katy
could
read
them
easily
she
looked
up
there
stooping
over
her
was
a
great
beautiful
face
the
eyes
met
hers
the
lips
smiled
why
did
you
ask
me
before
little
scholar
said
a
voice
why
it
is
you
just
as
cousin
helen
told
me
cried
katy
she
must
have
spoken
in
her
sleep
for
aunt
izzie
half
woke
up
and
said
what
is
it
do
you
want
anything
the
dream
broke
and
katy
roused
to
find
herself
in
bed
with
the
first
sunbeams
struggling
in
at
the
window
and
aunt
izzie
raised
on
her
elbow
looking
at
her
with
a
sort
of
sleepy
wonder
chapter
x
nicholas
and
valentine
what
are
the
children
all
doing
said
katy
laying
down
norway
and
the
norwegians
which
she
was
reading
for
the
fourth
time
i
have
seen
them
since
breakfast
aunt
izzie
who
was
sewing
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
looked
up
from
her
work
i
do
know
she
said
they
over
at
cecy
or
somewhere
be
back
before
long
i
guess
her
voice
sounded
a
little
odd
and
mysterious
but
katy
notice
it
i
thought
of
such
a
nice
plan
yesterday
she
went
on
that
was
that
all
of
them
should
hang
their
stockings
up
here
night
instead
of
in
the
nursery
then
i
could
see
them
open
their
presents
you
know
may
they
aunt
izzie
it
would
be
real
fun
i
do
believe
there
will
be
any
objection
replied
her
aunt
she
looked
as
if
she
were
trying
not
to
laugh
katy
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
her
it
was
more
than
two
months
now
since
cousin
helen
went
away
and
winter
had
fairly
come
snow
was
falling
katy
could
see
the
thick
flakes
go
whirling
past
the
window
but
the
sight
did
not
chill
her
it
only
made
the
room
look
warmer
and
more
cosy
it
was
a
pleasant
room
now
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate
everything
was
neat
and
orderly
the
air
was
sweet
with
mignonette
from
a
little
glass
of
flowers
which
stood
on
the
table
and
the
katy
who
lay
in
bed
was
a
very
katy
from
the
forlorn
girl
of
the
last
chapter
cousin
helen
visit
though
it
lasted
only
one
day
did
great
good
not
that
katy
grew
perfect
all
at
once
none
of
us
do
that
even
in
books
but
it
is
everything
to
be
started
in
the
right
path
katy
feet
were
on
it
now
and
though
she
often
stumbled
and
slipped
and
often
sat
down
discouraged
she
kept
on
pretty
steadily
in
spite
of
bad
days
which
made
her
say
to
herself
that
she
was
not
getting
forward
at
all
these
bad
days
when
everything
seemed
hard
and
she
herself
was
cross
and
fretful
and
drove
the
children
out
of
her
room
cost
katy
many
bitter
tears
but
after
them
she
would
pick
herself
up
and
try
again
and
harder
and
i
think
that
in
spite
of
drawbacks
the
little
scholar
on
the
whole
was
learning
her
lesson
pretty
well
cousin
helen
was
a
great
comfort
all
this
time
she
never
forgot
katy
nearly
every
week
some
little
thing
came
from
her
sometimes
it
was
a
pencil
note
written
from
her
sofa
sometimes
it
was
an
interesting
book
or
a
new
magazine
or
some
pretty
little
thing
for
the
room
the
crimson
wrapper
which
katy
wore
was
one
of
her
presents
so
were
the
bright
chromos
of
autumn
leaves
which
hung
on
the
wall
the
little
stand
for
the
books
all
sorts
of
things
katy
loved
to
look
about
her
as
she
lay
all
the
room
seemed
full
of
cousin
helen
and
her
kindness
i
wish
i
had
something
pretty
to
put
into
everybody
stocking
she
went
on
wistfully
but
i
only
got
the
muffetees
for
papa
and
these
reins
for
phil
she
took
them
from
under
her
pillow
as
she
spoke
gay
worsted
affairs
with
bells
sewed
on
here
and
there
she
had
knit
them
herself
a
very
little
bit
at
a
time
there
my
pink
sash
she
said
suddenly
i
might
give
that
to
clover
i
only
wore
it
once
you
know
and
i
do
think
i
got
any
spots
on
it
would
you
please
fetch
it
and
let
me
see
aunt
izzie
in
the
top
drawer
aunt
izzie
brought
the
sash
it
proved
to
be
quite
fresh
and
they
both
decided
that
it
would
do
nicely
for
clover
you
know
i
want
sashes
for
ever
so
long
said
katy
in
rather
a
sad
tone
and
this
is
a
beauty
when
she
spoke
next
her
voice
was
bright
again
i
wish
i
had
something
real
nice
for
elsie
do
you
know
aunt
izzie
i
think
elsie
is
the
dearest
little
girl
that
ever
was
i
glad
you
found
it
out
said
aunt
izzie
who
had
always
been
specially
fond
of
elsie
what
she
wants
most
of
all
is
a
continued
katy
and
johnnie
wants
a
sled
but
oh
dear
these
are
such
big
things
and
only
got
two
dollars
and
a
quarter
aunt
izzie
marched
out
of
the
room
without
saying
anything
when
she
came
back
she
had
something
folded
up
in
her
hand
i
did
know
what
to
give
you
for
christmas
katy
she
said
because
helen
sends
you
such
a
lot
of
things
that
there
do
seem
to
be
anything
you
have
already
so
i
thought
i
give
you
this
and
let
you
choose
for
yourself
but
if
you
set
your
heart
on
getting
presents
for
the
children
perhaps
you
rather
have
it
now
so
saying
aunt
izzie
laid
on
the
bed
a
crisp
new
bill
how
good
you
are
cried
katy
flushed
with
pleasure
and
indeed
aunt
izzie
seem
to
have
grown
wonderfully
good
of
late
perhaps
katy
had
got
hold
of
her
smooth
handle
being

so
much
aunt
izzie
must
have
been
a
witch
indeed
to
make
it
hold
out
but
she
did
and
next
day
all
the
precious
bundles
came
home
how
katy
enjoyed
untying
the
strings
everything
was
exactly
right
there
was
any
said
aunt
izzie
so
i
got
instead
it
beautiful
and
i
like
it
just
as
well
said
katy
contentedly
oh
hide
them
hide
them
she
cried
with
sudden
terror
coming
but
the
somebody
was
only
papa
who
put
his
head
into
the
room
as
aunt
izzie
laden
with
bundles
scuttled
across
the
hall
katy
was
glad
to
catch
him
alone
she
had
a
little
private
secret
to
talk
over
with
him
it
was
about
aunt
izzie
for
whom
she
as
yet
had
no
present
i
thought
perhaps
you
get
me
a
book
like
that
one
of
cousin
helen
which
aunt
izzie
liked
so
much
she
said
i
do
recollect
the
name
exactly
it
was
something
about
a
shadow
but
i
spent
all
my
money
never
mind
about
that
said
carr
we
make
that
right
shadow
of
the
cross
was
that
it
i
buy
it
this
afternoon
oh
thank
you
papa
and
please
get
a
brown
cover
if
you
can
because
cousin
helen
was
brown
and
you
wo
let
aunt
izzie
know
will
you
be
careful
papa
i
swallow
the
book
first
brown
cover
and
all
said
papa
making
a
funny
face
he
was
pleased
to
see
katy
so
interested
about
anything
again
these
delightful
secrets
took
up
so
much
of
her
thoughts
that
katy
scarcely
found
time
to
wonder
at
the
absence
of
the
children
who
generally
haunted
her
room
but
who
for
three
days
back
had
hardly
been
seen
however
after
supper
they
all
came
up
in
a
body
looking
very
merry
and
as
if
they
had
been
having
a
good
time
somewhere
you
do
know
what
we
been
doing
began
philly
hush
phil
said
clover
in
a
warning
voice
then
she
divided
the
stockings
which
she
held
in
her
hand
and
everybody
proceeded
to
hang
them
up
dorry
hung
his
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
and
john
hers
exactly
opposite
clover
and
phil
suspended
theirs
side
by
side
on
two
handles
of
the
bureau
i
going
to
put
mine
here
close
to
katy
so
that
she
can
see
it
the
first
fing
in
the
mornin
said
elsie
pinning
hers
to
the
then
they
all
sat
down
round
the
fire
to
write
their
wishes
on
bits
of
paper
and
see
whether
they
would
burn
or
fly
up
the
chimney
if
they
did
the
latter
it
was
a
sign
that
santa
claus
had
them
safe
and
would
bring
the
things
wished
for
john
wished
for
a
sled
and
a
doll
and
the
continuation
of
the
swiss
family
robinson
dorry
list
ran
thus
a
a
new
bibel
harry
and
lucy
a
kellidescope
everything
else
santa
claus
likes
when
they
had
written
these
lists
they
threw
them
into
the
fire
the
fire
gave
a
flicker
just
then
and
the
papers
vanished
nobody
saw
exactly
how
john
thought
they
flew
up
chimney
but
dorry
said
they
did
phil
dropped
his
piece
in
very
solemnly
it
flamed
for
a
minute
then
sank
into
ashes
there
you
wo
get
it
whatever
it
was
said
dorry
what
did
you
write
phil
nofing
said
phil
only
just
philly
carr
the
children
shouted
i
wrote
on
mine
remarked
elsie
sorrowfully
but
it
all
burned
up
katy
chuckled
when
she
heard
this
and
now
clover
produced
her
list
she
read
aloud
and
thrive
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
a
muff
a
good
temper
then
she
dropped
it
into
the
fire
behold
it
flew
straight
up
chimney
how
queer
said
katy
none
of
the
rest
of
them
did
that
the
truth
was
that
clover
who
was
a
canny
little
mortal
had
slipped
across
the
room
and
opened
the
door
just
before
putting
her
wishes
in
this
of
course
made
a
draft
and
sent
the
paper
right
upward
pretty
soon
aunt
izzie
came
in
and
swept
them
all
off
to
bed
i
know
how
it
will
be
in
the
morning
she
said
you
all
be
up
and
racing
about
as
soon
as
it
is
light
so
you
must
get
your
sleep
now
if
ever
after
they
had
gone
katy
recollected
that
nobody
had
offered
to
hang
a
stocking
up
for
her
she
felt
a
little
hurt
when
she
thought
of
it
but
i
suppose
they
forgot
she
said
to
herself
a
little
later
papa
and
aunt
izzie
came
in
and
they
filled
the
stockings
it
was
great
fun
each
was
brought
to
katy
as
she
lay
in
bed
that
she
might
arrange
it
as
she
liked
the
toes
were
stuffed
with
candy
and
oranges
then
came
the
parcels
all
shapes
and
sizes
tied
in
white
paper
with
ribbons
and
labelled
what
that
asked
carr
as
aunt
izzie
rammed
a
long
narrow
package
into
clover
stocking
a
answered
aunt
izzie
clover
needed
a
new
one
how
papa
and
katy
laughed
i
do
believe
santa
claus
ever
had
such
a
thing
before
said
carr
he
a
very
dirty
old
gentleman
then
observed
aunt
izzie
grimly
the
desk
and
sled
were
too
big
to
go
into
any
stocking
so
they
were
wrapped
in
paper
and
hung
beneath
the
other
things
it
was
ten
before
all
was
done
and
papa
and
aunt
izzie
went
away
katy
lay
a
long
time
watching
the
queer
shapes
of
the
as
they
dangled
in
the
firelight
then
she
fell
asleep
it
seemed
only
a
minute
before
something
touched
her
and
woke
her
up
behold
it
was
and
there
was
philly
in
his
nightgown
climbing
up
on
the
bed
to
kiss
her
the
rest
of
the
children
half
dressed
were
dancing
about
with
their
stockings
in
their
hands
merry
christmas
merry
christmas
they
cried
oh
katy
such
beautiful
beautiful
things
oh
shrieked
elsie
who
at
that
moment
spied
her
desk
santa
claus
bring
it
after
all
why
it
got
katy
written
on
it
oh
katy
it
so
sweet
and
i
happy
and
elsie
hugged
katy
and
sobbed
for
pleasure
but
what
was
that
strange
thing
beside
the
bed
katy
stared
and
rubbed
her
eyes
it
certainly
had
not
been
there
when
she
went
to
sleep
how
had
it
come
it
was
a
little
evergreen
tree
planted
in
a
red
the
pot
had
stripes
of
gilt
paper
stuck
on
it
and
gilt
stars
and
crosses
which
made
it
look
very
gay
the
boughs
of
the
tree
were
hung
with
oranges
and
nuts
and
shiny
red
apples
and
balls
and
strings
of
bright
berries
there
were
also
a
number
of
little
packages
tied
with
blue
and
crimson
ribbon
and
altogether
the
tree
looked
so
pretty
that
katy
gave
a
cry
of
delighted
surprise
it
a
for
you
because
you
sick
you
know
said
the
children
all
trying
to
hug
her
at
once
we
made
it
ourselves
said
dorry
hopping
about
on
one
foot
i
pasted
the
black
stars
on
the
pot
and
i
popped
the
corn
cried
philly
do
you
like
it
asked
elsie
cuddling
close
to
katy
that
my
present
that
one
tied
with
a
green
ribbon
i
wish
it
was
nicer
you
want
to
open
right
away
of
course
katy
wanted
to
all
sorts
of
things
came
out
of
the
little
bundles
the
children
had
arranged
every
parcel
themselves
no
grown
person
had
been
allowed
to
help
in
the
least
elsie
present
was
a
with
a
gray
flannel
kitten
on
it
johnnie
a
doll
of
scarlet
tin
is
it
she
said
admiringly
dorry
gift
i
regret
to
say
was
a
huge
spider
which
whirred
wildly
when
waved
at
the
end
of
its
string
they
did
want
me
to
buy
it
said
he
but
i
did
i
thought
it
would
amoose
you
does
it
amoose
you
katy
yes
indeed
said
katy
laughing
and
blinking
as
dorry
waved
the
spider
to
and
fro
before
her
eyes
you
can
play
with
it
when
we
ai
here
and
you
all
alone
you
know
remarked
dorry
highly
gratified
but
you
do
notice
what
the
tree
standing
upon
said
clover
it
was
a
chair
a
very
large
and
curious
one
with
a
back
which
ended
in
a
footstool
that
papa
present
said
clover
see
it
tips
back
so
as
to
be
just
like
a
bed
and
papa
says
he
thinks
pretty
soon
you
can
lie
on
it
in
the
window
where
you
can
see
us
play
does
he
really
said
katy
doubtfully
it
still
hurt
her
very
much
to
be
touched
or
moved
and
see
what
tied
to
the
arm
of
the
chair
said
elsie
it
was
a
little
silver
bell
with
katy
engraved
on
the
handle
cousin
helen
sent
it
it
for
you
to
ring
when
you
want
anybody
to
come
explained
elsie
more
surprises
to
the
other
arm
of
the
chair
was
fastened
a
beautiful
book
it
was
the
wide
wide
world
and
there
was
katy
name
written
on
it
her
affectionate
cecy
on
it
stood
a
great
parcel
of
dried
cherries
from
hall
hall
had
the
most
dried
cherries
the
children
thought
how
perfectly
lovely
everybody
is
said
katy
with
grateful
tears
in
her
eyes
that
was
a
pleasant
christmas
the
children
declared
it
to
be
the
nicest
they
had
ever
had
and
though
katy
could
quite
say
that
she
enjoyed
it
too
and
was
very
happy
it
was
several
weeks
before
she
was
able
to
use
the
chair
but
when
once
she
became
accustomed
to
it
it
proved
very
comfortable
aunt
izzie
would
dress
her
in
the
morning
tip
the
chair
back
till
it
was
on
a
level
with
the
bed
and
then
very
gently
and
gradually
draw
her
over
on
to
it
wheeling
across
the
room
was
always
painful
but
sitting
in
the
window
and
looking
out
at
the
clouds
the
people
going
by
and
the
children
playing
in
the
snow
was
delightful
how
delightful
nobody
knows
excepting
those
who
like
katy
have
lain
for
six
months
in
bed
without
a
peep
at
the
outside
world
every
day
she
grew
brighter
and
more
cheerful
how
jolly
santa
claus
was
this
year
she
happened
to
say
one
day
when
she
was
talking
with
cecy
i
wish
another
saint
would
come
and
pay
us
a
visit
but
i
do
know
any
more
except
cousin
helen
and
she
ca
there
valentine
suggested
cecy
sure
enough
what
a
bright
thought
cried
katy
clapping
her
hands
oh
cecy
let
do
something
funny
on
such
a
good
idea
has
just
popped
into
my
mind
so
the
two
girls
put
their
heads
together
and
held
a
long
mysterious
confabulation
what
it
was
about
we
shall
see
farther
on
was
the
next
friday
when
the
children
came
home
from
school
on
thursday
afternoon
aunt
izzie
met
them
and
to
their
great
surprise
told
them
that
cecy
was
come
to
drink
tea
and
they
must
all
go
up
stairs
and
be
made
nice
but
cecy
comes
most
every
day
remarked
dorry
who
did
see
the
connection
between
this
fact
and
having
his
face
washed
yes
but
you
are
to
take
tea
in
katy
room
said
aunt
izzie
here
are
the
invitations
one
for
each
of
you
sure
enough
there
was
a
neat
little
note
for
each
requesting
the
pleasure
of
their
company
at
queen
katharine
palace
that
afternoon
at
six
this
put
quite
a
different
aspect
on
the
affair
the
children
scampered
up
stairs
and
pretty
soon
all
nicely
brushed
and
washed
they
were
knocking
formally
at
the
door
of
the
palace
how
fine
it
sounded
the
room
looked
bright
and
inviting
katy
in
her
chair
sat
close
to
the
fire
cecy
was
beside
her
and
there
was
a
round
table
all
set
out
with
a
white
cloth
and
mugs
of
milk
and
biscuit
and
and
doughnuts
in
the
middle
was
a
loaf
of
frosted
cake
there
was
something
on
the
icing
which
looked
like
pink
letters
and
clover
leaning
forward
read
aloud
st
valentine
what
that
for
asked
dorry
why
you
know
this
is
replied
katy
debbie
remembered
it
i
guess
so
she
put
that
on
nothing
more
was
said
about
valentine
just
then
but
when
the
last
pink
letter
of
his
name
had
been
eaten
and
the
supper
had
been
cleared
away
suddenly
as
the
children
sat
by
the
fire
there
was
a
loud
rap
at
the
door
who
can
that
be
said
katy
please
see
clover
so
clover
opened
the
door
there
stood
bridget
trying
very
hard
not
to
laugh
and
holding
a
letter
in
her
hand
it
a
note
as
has
come
for
you
miss
clover
she
said
for
cried
clover
much
amazed
then
she
shut
the
door
and
brought
the
note
to
the
table
how
very
funny
she
exclaimed
as
she
looked
at
the
envelope
which
was
a
green
and
white
one
there
was
something
hard
inside
clover
broke
the
seal
out
tumbled
a
small
green
velvet
pincushion
made
in
the
shape
of
a
with
a
tiny
stem
of
wire
wound
with
green
silk
pinned
to
the
cushion
was
a
paper
with
these
verses
some
people
love
roses
well
tulips
gayly
dressed
some
love
violets
blue
and
sweet
i
love
clover

though
she
has
a
modest
air
though
no
grace
she
boast
though
no
gardener
call
her
fair
i
love
clover
most
butterfly

pass
her
by
he

but
a

i
a
faithful
loving
bee
and
i
stick
to
clover
this
was
the
first
valentine
clover
had
ever
had
she
was
perfectly
enchanted
oh
who
you
suppose
sent
it
she
cried
but
before
anybody
could
answer
there
came
another
loud
knock
at
the
door
which
made
them
all
jump
behold
bridget
again
with
a
second
letter
it
for
you
miss
elsie
this
time
she
said
with
a
grin
there
was
an
instant
rush
from
all
the
children
and
the
envelope
was
torn
open
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
inside
was
a
little
ivory
seal
with
elsie
on
it
in
old
english
letters
and
these
rhymes
i
know
a
little
girl
she
is
very
dear
to
me
she
is
just
as
sweet
as
honey
when
she
chooses
so
to
be
and
her
name
begins
with
e
and
ends
with
she
has
brown
hair
which
curls
and
black
eyes
for
to
see
with
teeth
like
tiny
pearls
and
dimples
one
two
three
and
her
name
begins
with
e
and
ends
with
her
little
feet
run
faster
than
other
feet
can
flee
as
she
brushes
quickly
past
her
voice
hums
like
a
bee
and
her
name
begins
with
e
and
ends
with
do
you
ask
me
why
i
love
her
then
i
shall
answer
thee
because
i
ca
help
loving
she
is
so
sweet
to
me
this
little
girl
whose
name
begins
and
ends
with
it
just
like
a
fairy
story
said
elsie
whose
eyes
had
grown
as
big
as
saucers
from
surprise
while
these
verses
were
being
read
aloud
by
cecy
another
knock
this
time
there
was
a
perfect
handful
of
letters
everybody
had
one
katy
to
her
great
surprise
had
why
what
this
be
she
said
but
when
she
peeped
into
the
second
one
she
saw
cousin
helen
handwriting
and
she
put
it
into
her
pocket
till
the
valentines
should
be
read
dorry
was
opened
first
it
had
the
picture
of
a
pie
at
the
top
i
ought
to
explain
that
dorry
had
lately
been
having
a
siege
with
the
dentist
little
jack
horner
sat
in
his
corner
eating
his
christmas
pie
when
a
sudden
grimace
spread
over
his
face
and
he
began
loudly
to
cry
his
tender
mamma
heard
the
sound
from
afar
and
hastened
to
comfort
her
child
aileth
my
john
she
inquired
in
a
tone
which
belied
her
question
mild
mother
he
said
tooth
in
my
head
jumps
and
aches
and
is
loose
o
my
and
it
hurts
me
to
eat
anything
that
is
sweet
so
what
become
of
my
pie
it
were
vain
to
describe
how
he
roared
and
he
cried
and
howled
like
a
miniature
tempest
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
very
next
day
he
had
all
his
teeth
pulled
by
a
dentist
this
valentine
made
the
children
laugh
for
a
long
time
envelope
held
a
paper
doll
named
red
these
were
the
verses
i
send
you
my
picture
dear
johnnie
to
show
that
i
just
as
alive
as
you
and
that
you
need
cry
over
my
fate
any
more
as
you
used
to
do
the
wolf
did
hurt
me
at
all
that
day
for
i
kicked
and
fought
and
cried
till
he
dropped
me
out
of
his
mouth
and
ran
away
in
the
woods
to
hide
and
grandma
and
i
have
lived
ever
since
in
the
little
brown
house
so
small
and
churned
fresh
butter
and
made
cream
cheeses
nor
seen
the
wolf
at
all
so
cry
no
more
for
fear
i
am
eaten
the
naughty
wolf
is
shot
and
if
you
will
come
to
tea
some
evening
you
shall
see
for
yourself
i
not
johnnie
was
immensely
pleased
at
this
for
red
was
a
great
favorite
of
hers
philly
had
a
bit
of
in
his
letter
which
was
written
with
very
black
ink
on
a
big
sheet
of
foolscap
i
was
once
a
naughty
man
and
i
hid
beneath
the
bed
to
steal
your
but
i
chewed
them
up
instead
then
you
called
out
is
there
i
was
thrown
most
in
a
fit
and
i
let
the
fall
all
but
this
little
bit
i
sorry
for
my
naughty
ways
and
now
to
make
amends
i
send
the
chewed
piece
back
again
and
beg
we
may
be
friends
robber
just
listen
to
mine
said
cecy
who
had
all
along
pretended
to
be
as
much
surprised
as
anybody
and
now
behaved
as
if
she
could
hardly
wait
till
philly
was
finished
then
she
read
aloud
to
cecy
if
i
were
a
bird
and
you
were
a
bird
what
would
we
do
why
you
should
be
little
and
i
would
be
big
and
side
by
side
on
a
twig
we
kiss
with
our
yellow
bills
and
coo
that
what
we
do
if
i
were
a
fish
and
you
were
a
fish
what
would
we
do
we
frolic
and
whisk
our
little
tails
and
play
all
sorts
of
tricks
with
the
whales
and
call
on
the
oysters
and
order
a
that
what
we
do
if
i
were
a
bee
and
you
were
a
bee
what
would
we
do
we
find
a
home
in
a
breezy
wood
and
store
it
with
honey
sweet
and
good
you
should
feed
me
and
i
would
feed
you
that
what
we
do
valentine
i
think
that
the
prettiest
of
all
said
clover
i
do
said
elsie
i
think
mine
is
the
prettiest
cecy
did
have
any
seal
in
hers
either
and
she
fondled
the
little
seal
which
all
this
time
she
had
held
in
her
hand
katy
you
ought
to
have
read
yours
first
because
you
are
the
oldest
said
clover
mine
is
much
replied
katy
and
she
read
the
rose
is
red
the
violet
blue
sugar
is
sweet
and
so
are
you
what
a
mean
valentine
cried
elsie
with
flashing
eyes
it
a
real
shame
katy
you
ought
to
have
had
the
best
of
all
katy
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
the
fact
was
that
the
verses
for
the
others
had
taken
so
long
that
no
time
had
been
left
for
writing
a
valentine
to
herself
so
thinking
it
would
excite
suspicion
to
have
none
she
had
scribbled
this
old
rhyme
at
the
last
moment
it
is
very
nice
she
said
trying
to
look
as
pensive
as
she
could
but
never
mind
it
a
shame
repeated
elsie
petting
her
very
hard
to
make
up
for
the
injustice
has
it
been
a
funny
evening
said
john
and
dorry
replied
yes
we
never
had
such
good
times
before
katy
was
sick
did
we
katy
heard
this
with
a
mingled
feeling
of
pleasure
and
pain
i
think
the
children
do
love
me
a
little
more
of
late
she
said
to
herself
but
oh
why
could
i
be
good
to
them
when
i
was
well
and
strong
she
did
open
cousin
helen
letter
until
the
rest
were
all
gone
to
bed
i
think
somebody
must
have
written
and
told
about
the
valentine
party
for
instead
of
a
note
there
were
these
verses
in
cousin
own
clear
pretty
hand
it
was
a
valentine
because
it
was
too
solemn
as
katy
explained
to
clover
next
day
but
she
added
it
is
a
great
deal
beautifuller
than
any
valentine
that
ever
was
written
and
clover
thought
so
too
these
were
the
verses
in
school
i
used
to
go
to
a
bright
school
where
youth
and
frolic
taught
in
turn
but
idle
scholar
that
i
was
i
liked
to
play
i
would
not
learn
so
the
great
teacher
did
ordain
that
i
should
try
the
school
of
pain
one
of
the
infant
class
i
am
with
little
easy
lessons
set
in
a
great
book
the
higher
class
have
harder
ones
than
i
and
yet
i
find
mine
hard
and
ca
restrain
my
tears
while
studying
thus
with
pain
there
are
two
teachers
in
the
school
one
has
a
gentle
voice
and
low
and
smiles
upon
her
scholars
as
she
softly
passes
to
and
fro
her
name
is
love
is
very
plain
she
shuns
the
sharper
teacher
pain
or
so
i
sometimes
think
and
then
at
other
times
they
meet
and
kiss
and
look
so
strangely
like
that
i
am
puzzled
to
tell
how
it
is
or
whence
the
change
which
makes
it
vain
to
guess
if
it
be
love
or
pain
they
tell
me
if
i
study
well
and
learn
my
lessons
i
shall
be
moved
upward
to
that
higher
class
where
dear
love
teaches
constantly
and
i
work
hard
in
hopes
to
gain
reward
and
get
away
from
pain
yet
pain
is
sometimes
kind
and
helps
me
on
when
i
am
very
dull
i
thank
him
often
in
my
heart
but
love
is
far
more
beautiful
under
her
tender
gentle
reign
i
must
learn
faster
than
of
pain
so
i
will
do
my
very
best
nor
chide
the
clock
nor
call
it
slow
that
when
the
teacher
calls
me
up
to
see
if
i
am
fit
to
go
i
may
to
love
high
class
attain
and
bid
a
sweet
to
pain
chapter
xi
a
new
lesson
to
learn
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
children
ceased
to
talk
and
laugh
over
that
jolly
evening
dorry
declared
he
wished
there
could
be
a
every
week
do
you
think
valentine
would
be
tired
of
writing
verses
asked
katy
but
she
too
had
enjoyed
the
frolic
and
the
bright
recollection
helped
her
along
through
the
rest
of
the
long
cold
winter
spring
opened
late
that
year
but
the
summer
when
it
came
was
a
warm
one
katy
felt
the
heat
very
much
she
could
not
change
her
seat
and
follow
the
breeze
about
from
window
to
window
as
other
people
could
the
long
burning
days
left
her
weak
and
parched
she
hung
her
head
and
seemed
to
wilt
like
the
flowers
in
the
indeed
she
was
worse
off
than
they
for
every
evening
alexander
gave
them
a
watering
with
the
hose
while
nobody
was
able
to
bring
a
and
pour
out
what
she
needed
a
shower
of
cold
fresh
air
it
was
easy
to
be
under
these
circumstances
and
one
could
hardly
have
blamed
katy
if
she
had
sometimes
forgotten
her
resolutions
and
been
cross
and
fretful
but
she
did
not
very
often
now
and
then
bad
days
came
when
she
was
discouraged
and
forlorn
but
katy
long
year
of
schooling
had
taught
her
and
as
a
general
thing
her
discomforts
were
borne
patiently
she
could
not
help
growing
pale
and
thin
however
and
papa
saw
with
concern
that
as
the
summer
went
on
she
became
too
languid
to
read
or
study
or
sew
and
just
sat
hour
after
hour
with
folded
hands
gazing
wistfully
out
of
the
window
he
tried
the
experiment
of
taking
her
to
drive
but
the
motion
of
the
carriage
and
the
being
lifted
in
and
out
brought
on
so
much
pain
that
katy
begged
that
he
would
not
ask
her
to
go
again
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
wait
for
cooler
weather
the
summer
dragged
on
and
all
who
loved
katy
rejoiced
when
it
was
over
when
september
came
with
cool
mornings
and
nights
and
fresh
breezes
smelling
of
pine
woods
and
all
things
seemed
to
revive
and
katy
with
them
she
began
to
crochet
and
to
read
after
a
while
she
collected
her
books
again
and
tried
to
study
as
cousin
helen
had
advised
but
so
many
idle
weeks
made
it
seem
harder
work
than
ever
one
day
she
asked
papa
to
let
her
take
french
lessons
you
see
i
forgetting
all
i
knew
she
said
and
clover
is
going
to
begin
this
term
and
i
do
like
that
she
should
get
so
far
ahead
of
me
do
you
think
bergèr
would
be
willing
to
come
here
papa
he
does
go
to
houses
sometimes
i
think
he
would
if
we
asked
him
said
carr
pleased
to
see
katy
waking
up
with
something
like
life
again
so
the
arrangement
was
made
bergèr
came
twice
every
week
and
sat
beside
the
big
chair
correcting
katy
exercises
and
practising
her
in
the
verbs
and
pronunciation
he
was
a
lively
little
old
frenchman
and
knew
how
to
make
pleasant
you
take
more
pain
than
you
used
mademoiselle
he
said
one
day
if
you
go
on
so
you
shall
be
my
best
scholar
and
if
to
hurt
the
back
make
you
study
it
would
be
well
that
some
other
of
my
young
ladies
shall
do
the
same
katy
laughed
but
in
spite
of
bergèr
and
his
lessons
and
in
spite
of
her
endeavors
to
keep
cheerful
and
busy
this
second
winter
was
harder
than
the
first
it
is
often
so
with
sick
people
there
is
a
sort
of
excitement
in
being
ill
which
helps
along
just
at
the
beginning
but
as
months
go
on
and
everything
grows
an
old
story
and
one
day
follows
another
day
all
just
alike
and
all
tiresome
courage
is
apt
to
flag
and
spirits
to
grow
dull
spring
seemed
a
long
long
way
off
whenever
katy
thought
about
it
i
wish
something
would
happen
she
often
said
to
herself
and
something
was
about
to
happen
but
she
little
guessed
what
it
was
going
to
be
katy
said
clover
coming
in
one
day
in
november
do
you
know
where
the
camphor
is
aunt
izzie
has
got
a
headache
no
replied
katy
i
do
or
wait
clover
it
seems
to
me
that
debby
came
for
it
the
other
day
perhaps
if
you
look
in
her
room
you
find
it
how
very
queer
she
soliloquized
when
clover
was
gone
i
never
knew
aunt
izzie
to
have
a
headache
before
how
is
aunt
izzie
she
asked
when
papa
came
in
at
noon
well
i
do
know
she
has
some
fever
and
a
bad
pain
in
her
head
i
have
told
her
that
she
had
better
lie
still
and
not
try
to
get
up
this
evening
old
mary
will
come
in
to
undress
you
katy
you
wo
mind
will
you
dear
said
katy
reluctantly
but
she
did
mind
aunt
izzie
had
grown
used
to
her
and
her
ways
nobody
else
suited
her
so
well
it
seems
so
strange
to
have
to
explain
just
how
every
little
thing
is
to
be
done
she
remarked
to
clover
rather
petulantly
it
seemed
stranger
yet
when
the
next
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
after
that
passed
and
still
no
aunt
izzie
came
near
her
blessings
brighten
as
they
take
their
flight
katy
began
to
appreciate
for
the
first
time
how
much
she
had
learned
to
rely
on
her
aunt
she
missed
her
dreadfully
when
aunt
izzie
going
to
get
well
she
asked
her
father
i
want
her
so
much
we
all
want
her
said
carr
who
looked
disturbed
and
anxious
is
she
very
sick
asked
katy
struck
by
the
expression
of
his
face
pretty
sick
i
afraid
he
replied
i
going
to
get
a
regular
nurse
to
take
care
of
her
aunt
izzie
attack
proved
to
be
typhoid
fever
the
doctors
said
that
the
house
must
be
kept
quiet
so
john
and
dorry
and
phil
were
sent
over
to
hall
to
stay
elsie
and
clover
were
to
have
gone
too
but
they
begged
so
hard
and
made
so
many
promises
of
good
behavior
that
finally
papa
permitted
them
to
remain
the
dear
little
things
stole
about
the
house
on
tiptoe
as
quietly
as
mice
whispering
to
each
other
and
waiting
on
katy
who
would
have
been
lonely
enough
without
them
for
everybody
else
was
absorbed
in
aunt
izzie
it
was
a
confused
melancholy
time
the
three
girls
did
know
much
about
sickness
but
papa
grave
face
and
the
hushed
house
weighed
upon
their
spirits
and
they
missed
the
children
very
much
oh
dear
sighed
elsie
how
i
wish
aunt
izzie
would
hurry
and
get
well
we
be
real
good
to
her
when
she
does
wo
we
said
clover
i
never
mean
to
leave
my
rubbers
in
the
any
more
because
she
do
like
to
have
me
and
i
shall
pick
up
the
and
put
them
in
the
box
every
night
yes
added
elsie
so
will
i
when
she
gets
well
it
never
occurred
to
either
of
them
that
perhaps
aunt
izzie
might
not
get
well
little
people
are
apt
to
feel
as
if
grown
folks
are
so
strong
and
so
big
that
nothing
can
possibly
happen
to
them
katy
was
more
anxious
still
she
did
not
fairly
realize
the
danger
so
it
came
like
a
sudden
and
violent
shock
to
her
when
one
morning
on
waking
up
she
found
old
mary
crying
quietly
beside
the
bed
with
her
apron
at
her
eyes
aunt
izzie
had
died
in
the
night
all
their
kind
penitent
thoughts
of
her
their
resolutions
to
please
their
plans
for
obeying
her
wishes
and
saving
her
trouble
were
too
late
for
the
first
time
the
three
girls
sobbing
in
each
arms
realized
what
a
good
friend
aunt
izzie
had
been
to
them
her
worrying
ways
were
all
forgotten
now
they
could
only
remember
the
many
kind
things
she
had
done
for
them
since
they
were
little
children
how
they
wished
that
they
had
never
teased
her
never
said
sharp
words
about
her
to
each
other
but
it
was
no
use
to
wish
what
shall
we
do
without
aunt
izzie
thought
katy
as
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
and
the
question
came
into
her
mind
again
and
again
after
the
funeral
was
over
and
the
little
ones
had
come
back
from
hall
and
things
began
to
go
on
in
their
usual
manner
for
several
days
she
saw
almost
nothing
of
her
father
clover
reported
that
he
looked
very
tired
and
scarcely
said
a
word
did
papa
eat
any
dinner
asked
katy
one
afternoon
not
much
he
said
he
was
hungry
and
jackson
boy
came
for
him
before
we
were
through
oh
dear
sighed
katy
i
do
hope
is
going
to
be
sick
how
it
rains
clovy
i
wish
you
run
down
and
get
out
his
slippers
and
put
them
by
the
fire
to
warm
oh
and
ask
debby
to
make
some
for
tea
papa
likes
after
tea
carr
came
up
stairs
to
sit
a
while
in
katy
room
he
often
did
so
but
this
was
the
first
time
since
aunt
izzie
death
katy
studied
his
face
anxiously
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
had
grown
older
of
late
and
there
was
a
sad
look
upon
it
which
made
her
heart
ache
she
longed
to
do
something
for
him
but
all
she
could
do
was
to
poke
the
fire
bright
and
then
to
possess
herself
of
his
hand
and
stroke
it
gently
with
both
hers
it
was
much
to
be
sure
but
i
think
papa
liked
it
what
have
you
been
about
all
day
he
asked
oh
nothing
much
said
katy
i
studied
my
french
lesson
this
morning
and
after
school
elsie
and
john
brought
in
their
patchwork
and
we
had
a
that
all
i
been
thinking
how
we
are
to
manage
about
the
housekeeping
said
carr
of
course
we
shall
have
to
get
somebody
to
come
and
take
charge
but
it
is
easy
to
find
just
the
right
person
hall
knows
of
a
woman
who
might
do
but
she
is
out
west
just
now
and
it
will
be
a
week
or
two
before
we
can
hear
from
her
do
you
think
you
can
get
on
as
you
are
for
a
few
days
oh
papa
cried
katy
in
dismay
must
we
have
anybody
why
how
did
you
suppose
we
were
going
to
arrange
it
clover
is
much
too
young
for
a
housekeeper
and
beside
she
is
at
school
all
day
i
do
know
i
had
thought
about
it
said
katy
in
a
perplexed
tone
but
she
did
think
about
it
all
that
evening
and
the
first
thing
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
papa
she
said
the
next
time
she
got
him
to
herself
i
been
thinking
over
what
you
were
saying
last
night
about
getting
somebody
to
keep
the
house
you
know
and
i
wish
you
would
i
wish
you
would
let
try
really
and
truly
i
think
i
could
manage
but
how
asked
carr
much
surprised
i
really
do
see
if
you
were
well
and
strong
perhaps
but
even
then
you
would
be
pretty
young
for
such
a
charge
katy
i
shall
be
fourteen
in
two
weeks
said
katy
drawing
herself
up
in
her
chair
as
straight
as
she
could
and
if
i
well
papa
i
should
be
going
to
school
you
know
and
then
of
course
i
could
no
i
tell
you
my
plan
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
debby
and
bridget
have
been
with
us
so
long
that
they
know
all
aunt
izzie
ways
and
such
good
women
that
all
they
want
is
just
to
be
told
a
little
now
and
then
now
why
could
they
come
up
to
me
when
anything
is
wanted
just
as
well
as
to
have
me
go
down
to
them
clover
and
old
mary
will
keep
watch
you
know
and
see
if
anything
is
wrong
and
you
would
mind
if
things
were
a
little
crooked
just
at
first
would
you
because
you
know
i
should
be
learning
all
the
time
do
let
me
try
it
will
be
real
nice
to
have
something
to
think
about
as
i
sit
up
here
alone
so
much
better
than
having
a
stranger
in
the
house
who
does
know
the
children
or
anything
i
am
sure
it
will
make
me
happier
please
say
papa
please
do
it
too
much
for
you
a
great
deal
too
much
replied
carr
but
it
was
not
easy
to
resist
katy
please
please
and
after
a
while
it
ended
with
well
darling
you
may
try
though
i
am
doubtful
as
to
the
result
of
the
experiment
i
will
tell
hall
to
put
off
writing
to
wisconsin
for
a
month
and
we
will
see
poor
child
anything
to
take
her
thoughts
off
herself
he
muttered
as
he
walked
down
stairs
she
be
glad
enough
to
give
the
thing
up
by
the
end
of
the
month
but
papa
was
mistaken
at
the
end
of
a
month
katy
was
eager
to
go
on
so
he
said
very
well
she
might
try
it
till
spring
it
was
not
such
hard
work
as
it
sounds
katy
had
plenty
of
quiet
for
one
thing
the
children
were
at
school
all
day
and
few
visitors
came
to
interrupt
her
so
she
could
plan
out
her
hours
and
keep
to
the
plans
that
is
a
great
help
to
a
housekeeper
then
aunt
izzie
regular
punctual
ways
were
so
well
understood
by
the
servants
that
the
house
seemed
almost
to
keep
itself
as
katy
had
said
all
debby
and
bridget
needed
was
a
little
telling
now
and
then
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
the
dishes
were
washed
and
put
away
debby
would
tie
on
a
clean
apron
and
come
up
stairs
for
orders
at
first
katy
thought
this
great
fun
but
after
ordering
dinner
a
good
many
times
it
began
to
grow
tiresome
she
never
saw
the
dishes
after
they
were
cooked
and
being
inexperienced
it
seemed
impossible
to
think
of
things
enough
to
make
a
variety
let
me
see
there
is
roast
beef
leg
of
mutton
boiled
chicken
she
would
say
counting
on
her
fingers
roast
beef
leg
of
mutton
boiled
chicken
debby
you
might
roast
the
chickens
dear
i
wish
somebody
would
invent
a
new
animal
where
all
the
things
to
eat
are
gone
to
i
ca
imagine
then
katy
would
send
for
every
in
the
house
and
pore
over
them
by
the
hour
till
her
appetite
was
as
completely
gone
as
if
she
had
swallowed
twenty
dinners
poor
debby
learned
to
dread
these
books
she
would
stand
by
the
door
with
her
pleasant
red
face
drawn
up
into
a
pucker
while
katy
read
aloud
some
rule
this
looks
as
if
it
were
delicious
debby
i
wish
you
try
it
take
a
gallon
of
oysters
a
pint
of
beef
stock
sixteen
soda
crackers
the
juice
of
two
lemons
four
cloves
a
glass
of
white
wine
a
sprig
of
marjoram
a
sprig
of
thyme
a
sprig
of
bay
a
sliced
shalott
please
miss
katy
what
them
oh
do
you
know
debby
it
must
be
something
quite
common
for
in
almost
all
the
recipes
no
miss
katy
i
never
heard
tell
of
it
before
miss
carr
never
gave
me
no
at
all
at
all
dear
me
how
provoking
katy
would
cry
flapping
over
the
leaves
of
her
book
then
we
must
try
something
else
poor
debby
if
she
had
loved
katy
so
dearly
i
think
her
patience
must
have
given
way
but
she
bore
her
trials
meekly
except
for
an
occasional
grumble
when
alone
with
bridget
carr
had
to
eat
a
great
many
queer
things
in
those
days
but
he
did
mind
and
as
for
the
children
they
enjoyed
it
became
quite
exciting
when
nobody
could
tell
exactly
what
any
dish
on
the
table
was
made
of
dorry
who
was
a
sort
of
livingstone
where
strange
articles
of
food
were
concerned
usually
made
the
first
experiment
and
if
he
said
that
it
was
good
the
rest
followed
suit
after
a
while
katy
grew
wiser
she
ceased
teasing
debby
to
try
new
things
and
the
carr
family
went
back
to
plain
roast
and
boiled
much
to
the
advantage
of
all
concerned
but
then
another
series
of
experiments
began
katy
got
hold
of
a
book
upon
the
stomach
and
was
seized
with
a
rage
for
wholesome
food
she
entreated
clover
and
the
other
children
to
give
up
sugar
and
butter
and
gravy
and
and
buckwheat
cakes
and
pies
and
almost
everything
else
that
they
particularly
liked
boiled
rice
seemed
to
her
the
most
sensible
dessert
and
she
kept
the
family
on
it
until
finally
john
and
dorry
started
a
rebellion
and
carr
was
forced
to
interfere
my
dear
you
are
overdoing
it
sadly
he
said
as
katy
opened
her
book
and
prepared
to
explain
her
views
i
am
glad
to
have
the
children
eat
simple
food
but
really
boiled
rice
five
times
in
a
week
is
too
much
katy
sighed
but
submitted
later
as
the
spring
came
on
she
had
a
fit
of
and
was
always
sending
clover
down
to
ask
debby
if
her
bread
was
not
burning
or
if
she
was
sure
that
the
pickles
were
not
fermenting
in
their
jars
she
also
fidgeted
the
children
about
wearing
and
keeping
on
their
coats
and
behaved
altogether
as
if
the
cares
of
the
world
were
on
her
shoulders
but
all
these
were
but
the
natural
mistakes
of
a
beginner
katy
was
too
much
in
earnest
not
to
improve
month
by
month
she
learned
how
to
manage
a
little
better
and
a
little
better
still
matters
went
on
more
smoothly
her
cares
ceased
to
fret
her
carr
watching
the
increasing
brightness
of
her
face
and
manner
felt
that
the
experiment
was
a
success
nothing
more
was
said
about
somebody
else
and
katy
sitting
up
stairs
in
her
big
chair
held
the
threads
of
the
house
firmly
in
her
hands
chapter
xii
two
years
afterward
it
was
a
pleasant
morning
in
early
june
a
warm
wind
was
rustling
the
trees
which
were
covered
thickly
with
leaves
and
looked
like
fountains
of
green
spray
thrown
high
into
the
air
carr
front
door
stood
wide
open
through
the
parlor
window
came
the
sound
of
piano
practice
and
on
the
steps
under
the
budding
roses
sat
a
small
figure
busily
sewing
this
was
clover
little
clover
still
though
more
than
two
years
had
passed
since
we
saw
her
last
and
she
was
now
over
fourteen
clover
was
never
intended
to
be
tall
her
eyes
were
as
blue
and
sweet
as
ever
and
her
cheeks
as
pink
but
the
brown
were
pinned
up
into
a
round
knot
and
the
childish
face
had
gained
almost
a
womanly
look
old
mary
declared
that
miss
clover
was
getting
quite
and
miss
clover
was
quite
aware
of
the
fact
and
mightily
pleased
with
it
it
delighted
her
to
turn
up
her
hair
and
she
was
very
particular
about
having
her
dresses
made
to
come
below
the
tops
of
her
boots
she
had
also
left
off
ruffles
and
wore
narrow
collars
instead
and
little
cuffs
with
to
fasten
them
these
which
were
a
present
from
cousin
helen
clover
liked
best
of
all
her
things
papa
said
that
he
was
sure
she
took
them
to
bed
with
her
but
of
course
that
was
only
a
joke
though
she
certainly
was
never
seen
without
them
in
the
daytime
she
glanced
frequently
at
these
beloved
buttons
as
she
sat
sewing
and
every
now
and
then
laid
down
her
work
to
twist
them
into
a
better
position
or
give
them
an
affectionate
pat
with
her
forefinger
pretty
soon
the
swung
open
and
philly
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
he
had
grown
into
a
big
boy
all
his
pretty
baby
curls
were
cut
off
and
his
frocks
had
given
place
to
jacket
and
trousers
in
his
hand
he
held
something
what
clover
could
not
see
what
that
she
said
as
he
reached
the
steps
i
going
up
stairs
to
ask
katy
if
these
are
ripe
replied
phil
exhibiting
some
currants
faintly
streaked
with
red
why
of
course
they
not
ripe
said
clover
putting
one
into
her
mouth
ca
you
tell
by
the
taste
they
as
green
as
can
be
i
do
care
if
katy
says
they
ripe
i
shall
eat
answered
phil
defiantly
marching
into
the
house
what
did
philly
want
asked
elsie
opening
the
parlor
door
as
phil
went
up
stairs
only
to
know
if
the
currants
are
ripe
enough
to
eat
how
particular
he
always
is
about
asking
now
said
elsie
he
afraid
of
another
dose
of
salts
i
should
think
he
would
be
replied
clover
laughing
johnnie
says
she
never
was
so
scared
in
her
life
as
when
papa
called
them
and
they
looked
up
and
saw
him
standing
there
with
the
bottle
in
one
hand
and
a
spoon
in
the
other
yes
went
on
elsie
and
you
know
dorry
held
his
in
his
mouth
for
ever
so
long
and
then
went
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
spat
it
out
papa
said
he
had
a
good
mind
to
make
him
take
another
spoonful
but
he
remembered
that
after
all
dorry
had
the
bad
taste
a
great
deal
longer
than
the
others
so
he
did
i
think
it
was
an
punishment
do
you
yes
but
it
was
a
good
one
for
none
of
them
have
ever
touched
the
green
gooseberries
since
have
you
got
through
practising
it
seem
like
an
hour
yet
oh
it
is
it
only
minutes
but
katy
told
me
not
to
sit
more
than
half
an
hour
at
a
time
without
getting
up
and
running
round
to
rest
i
going
to
walk
twice
down
to
the
gate
and
twice
back
i
promised
her
i
would
and
elsie
set
off
clapping
her
hands
briskly
before
and
behind
her
as
she
walked
why
what
is
bridget
doing
in
papa
room
she
asked
as
she
came
back
the
second
time
she
flapping
things
out
of
the
window
are
the
girls
up
there
i
thought
they
were
cleaning
the
they
doing
both
katy
said
it
was
such
a
good
chance
having
papa
away
that
she
would
have
both
the
carpets
taken
up
at
once
there
going
to
be
any
dinner
today
only
just
bread
and
butter
and
milk
and
cold
ham
up
in
katy
room
because
debby
is
helping
too
so
as
to
get
through
and
save
papa
all
the
fuss
and
see
exhibiting
her
sewing
katy
making
a
new
cover
for
papa
pincushion
and
i
hemming
the
ruffle
to
go
round
it
how
nicely
you
hem
said
elsie
i
wish
i
had
something
for
room
too
there
my
washstand
mats
but
the
one
for
the
finished
do
you
suppose
if
katy
would
excuse
me
from
the
rest
of
my
practising
i
could
get
it
done
i
a
great
mind
to
go
and
ask
her
there
her
bell
said
clover
as
a
little
tinkle
sounded
up
stairs
i
ask
her
if
you
like
no
let
me
go
i
see
what
she
wants
but
clover
was
already
across
the
hall
and
the
two
girls
ran
up
side
by
side
there
was
often
a
little
strife
between
them
as
to
which
should
answer
bell
both
liked
to
wait
on
her
so
much
katy
came
to
meet
them
as
they
entered
not
on
her
feet
that
alas
was
still
only
a
possibility
but
in
a
chair
with
large
wheels
with
which
she
was
rolling
herself
across
the
room
this
chair
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
sitting
in
it
she
could
get
to
her
closet
and
her
and
help
herself
to
what
she
wanted
without
troubling
anybody
it
was
only
lately
that
she
had
been
able
to
use
it
carr
considered
her
doing
so
as
a
hopeful
sign
but
he
had
never
told
katy
this
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
her
invalid
life
at
last
and
was
cheerful
in
it
and
he
thought
it
unwise
to
make
her
restless
by
exciting
hopes
which
might
after
all
end
in
fresh
disappointment
she
met
the
girls
with
a
bright
smile
as
they
came
in
and
said
oh
clovy
it
was
you
i
rang
for
i
am
troubled
for
fear
bridget
will
meddle
with
the
things
on
papa
table
you
know
he
likes
them
to
be
left
just
so
will
you
please
go
and
remind
her
that
she
is
not
to
touch
them
at
all
after
the
carpet
is
put
down
i
want
you
to
dust
the
table
so
as
to
be
sure
that
everything
is
put
back
in
the
same
place
will
you
of
course
i
will
said
clover
who
was
a
born
housewife
and
dearly
loved
to
act
as
katy
prime
minister
i
fetch
you
the
pincushion
too
while
i
there
oh
yes
please
do
i
want
to
measure
katy
said
elsie
those
mats
of
mine
are
most
done
and
i
would
like
to
finish
them

them
on
papa
washstand
before
he
comes
back
may
i
stop
practising
now
and
bring
my
crochet
up
here
instead

there

plenty
of
time
to

exercise
before
miss
phillips
comes
if
you
do
i
think
so
plenty
she
does

then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
just
as
well
as
not
and
elsie
dear
run
into
papa
room
first
and
bring
me
the
drawer
out
of
his
table
i
want
to
put
that
in
order
myself
elsie
went
cheerfully
she
laid
the
drawer
across
katy
lap
and
katy
began
to
dust
and
arrange
the
contents
pretty
soon
clover
joined
them
here
the
cushion
she
said
now
we
have
a
nice
quiet
time
all
by
ourselves
wo
we
i
like
this
sort
of
day
when
nobody
comes
in
to
interrupt
us
somebody
tapped
at
the
door
as
she
spoke
katy
called
out
come
and
in
marched
a
tall
lad
with
a
solemn
sensible
face
and
a
little
clock
carried
carefully
in
both
his
hands
this
was
dorry
he
has
grown
and
improved
very
much
since
we
saw
him
last
and
is
turning
out
clever
in
several
ways
among
the
rest
he
has
developed
a
strong
turn
for
mechanics
here
your
clock
katy
he
said
i
got
it
fixed
so
that
it
strikes
all
right
only
you
must
be
careful
not
to
hit
the
striker
when
you
start
the
pendulum
have
you
really
said
katy
why
dorry
you
a
genius
i
ever
so
much
obliged
it
four
minutes
to
eleven
now
went
on
dorry
so
it
strike
pretty
soon
i
guess
i
better
stay
and
hear
it
so
as
to
be
sure
that
it
is
right
that
is
he
added
politely
unless
you
busy
and
would
rather
not
i
never
too
busy
to
want
you
old
fellow
said
katy
stroking
his
arm
here
this
drawer
is
arranged
now
do
you
want
to
carry
it
into
papa
room
and
put
it
back
into
the
table
your
hands
are
stronger
than
elsie
dorry
looked
gratified
when
he
came
back
the
clock
was
just
beginning
to
strike
there
he
exclaimed
that
splendid
is
it
but
alas
the
clock
did
not
stop
at
eleven
it
went
on
twelve
thirteen
fourteen
fifteen
sixteen
dear
me
said
clover
what
does
all
this
mean
it
must
be
day
after
at
least
dorry
stared
with
open
mouth
at
the
clock
which
was
still
striking
as
though
it
would
split
its
sides
elsie
screaming
with
laughter
kept
count
thirty
oh
dorry
you
bewitched
it
dorry
said
katy
as
much
entertained
as
the
rest
then
they
all
began
counting
dorry
seized
the
clock
shook
it
slapped
it
turned
it
but
still
the
sharp
vibrating
sounds
continued
as
if
the
clock
having
got
its
own
way
for
once
meant
to
go
on
till
it
was
tired
out
at
last
at
the
stroke
it
suddenly
ceased
and
dorry
with
a
red
amazed
countenance
faced
the
laughing
company
it
very
queer
he
said
but
i
sure
it
not
because
of
anything
i
did
i
can
fix
it
though
if
you
let
me
try
again
may
i
katy
promise
not
to
hurt
it
for
a
moment
katy
hesitated
clover
pulled
her
sleeve
and
whispered
do
then
seeing
the
mortification
on
dorry
face
she
made
up
her
mind
yes
take
it
dorry
i
sure
you
be
careful
but
if
i
were
you
carry
it
down
to
wetherell
first
of
all
and
talk
it
over
with
them
together
you
could
hit
on
just
the
right
thing
do
you
think
so
perhaps
said
dorry
yes
i
think
i
will
then
he
departed
with
the
clock
under
his
arm
while
clover
called
after
him
teasingly
lunch
at
do
forget
no
i
wo
said
dorry
two
years
before
he
would
not
have
borne
to
be
laughed
at
so
how
could
you
let
him
take
your
clock
again
said
clover
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
he
spoil
it
and
you
think
so
much
of
it
i
thought
he
would
feel
mortified
if
i
did
let
him
try
replied
katy
quietly
i
do
believe
he
hurt
it
wetherell
man
likes
dorry
and
he
show
him
what
to
do
you
were
real
good
to
do
it
responded
clover
but
if
it
had
been
mine
i
do
think
i
could
just
then
the
door
flew
open
and
johnnie
rushed
in
two
years
taller
but
otherwise
looking
exactly
as
she
used
to
do
oh
katy
she
gasped
wo
you
please
tell
philly
not
to
wash
the
chickens
in
the
tub
he
put
in
every
one
of
speckle
and
is
just
beginning
on
dame
durden
i
afraid
one
little
yellow
one
is
dead
already
why
he
must
of
course
he
must
said
katy
what
made
him
think
of
such
a
thing
he
says
they
dirty
because
they
just
come
out
of
and
he
insists
that
the
yellow
on
them
is
i
told
him
it
was
but
he
would
listen
to
me
and
johnnie
wrung
her
hands
clover
cried
katy
wo
you
run
down
and
ask
philly
to
come
up
to
me
speak
pleasantly
you
know
i
spoke
pleasantly
real
pleasantly
but
it
was
any
use
said
johnnie
on
whom
the
wrongs
of
the
chicks
had
evidently
made
a
deep
impression
what
a
mischief
phil
is
getting
to
be
said
elsie
papa
says
his
name
ought
to
be
pickle
pickles
turn
out
very
nice
sometimes
you
know
replied
katy
laughing
pretty
soon
philly
came
up
escorted
by
clover
he
looked
a
little
defiant
but
katy
understood
how
to
manage
him
she
lifted
him
into
her
lap
which
big
boy
as
he
was
he
liked
extremely
and
talked
to
him
so
affectionately
about
the
poor
little
shivering
chicks
that
his
heart
was
quite
melted
i
did
mean
to
hurt
really
and
truly
he
said
but
they
were
all
dirty
and
yellow
with
egg
you
know
and
i
thought
you
like
me
to
clean
up
but
that
was
egg
philly
it
was
dear
little
clean
feathers
like
a
wings
was
it
yes
and
now
the
chickies
are
as
cold
and
forlorn
as
you
would
feel
if
you
tumbled
into
a
pond
and
nobody
gave
you
any
dry
clothes
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
and
warm
them
how
well
in
your
hands
very
gently
and
then
i
would
let
them
run
round
in
the
sun
i
will
said
philly
getting
down
from
her
lap
only
kiss
me
first
because
i
did
mean
to
you
know
philly
was
very
fond
of
katy
miss
petingill
said
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
that
child
let
himself
be
managed
but
i
think
the
secret
was
that
katy
did
manage
but
tried
to
be
always
kind
and
loving
and
considerate
of
phil
feelings
before
the
echo
of
phil
boots
had
fairly
died
away
on
the
stairs
old
mary
put
her
head
into
the
door
there
was
a
distressed
expression
on
her
face
miss
katy
she
said
i
wish
speak
to
alexander
about
putting
the
woodshed
in
order
i
do
think
you
know
how
bad
it
looks
i
do
suppose
i
do
said
katy
smiling
and
then
sighing
she
had
never
seen
the
since
the
day
of
her
fall
from
the
swing
never
mind
mary
i
talk
to
alexander
about
it
and
he
shall
make
it
all
nice
mary
trotted
down
stairs
satisfied
but
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
she
was
up
again
there
a
man
come
with
a
box
of
soap
miss
katy
and
here
the
bill
he
says
it
resated
it
took
katy
a
little
time
to
find
her
purse
and
then
she
wanted
her
pencil
and
account
book
and
elsie
had
to
move
from
her
seat
at
the
table
oh
dear
she
said
i
wish
people
would
keep
coming
and
interrupting
us
who
be
the
next
i
wonder
she
was
not
left
to
wonder
long
almost
as
she
spoke
there
was
another
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
katy
rather
wearily
the
door
opened
shall
i
said
a
voice
there
was
a
rustle
of
skirts
a
clatter
of
and
imogen
clark
swept
into
the
room
katy
could
not
think
who
it
was
at
first
she
had
not
seen
imogen
for
almost
two
years
i
found
the
front
door
open
explained
imogen
in
her
voice
and
as
nobody
seemed
to
hear
when
i
rang
the
bell
i
ventured
to
come
right
up
stairs
i
hope
i
not
interrupting
anything
private
not
at
all
said
katy
politely
elsie
dear
move
up
that
low
chair
please
do
sit
down
imogen
i
sorry
nobody
answered
your
ring
but
the
servants
are
cleaning
house
and
i
suppose
they
did
hear
so
imogen
sat
down
and
began
to
rattle
on
in
her
usual
manner
while
elsie
from
behind
katy
chair
took
a
survey
of
her
dress
it
was
of
cheap
material
but
very
gorgeously
made
and
trimmed
with
flounces
and
puffs
and
imogen
wore
a
jet
necklace
and
long
black
which
jingled
and
clicked
when
she
waved
her
head
about
she
still
had
the
little
round
curls
stuck
on
to
her
cheeks
and
elsie
wondered
anew
what
kept
them
in
their
places
by
and
by
the
object
of
imogen
visit
came
out
she
had
called
to
say
the
clark
family
were
all
going
back
to
jacksonville
to
live
did
you
ever
see
the
brigand
again
asked
clover
who
had
never
forgotten
that
eventful
tale
told
in
the
parlor
yes
replied
imogen
several
times
and
i
get
letters
from
him
quite
often
he
writes
letters
i
wish
i
had
one
with
me
so
that
i
could
read
you
a
little
bit
you
would
enjoy
it
i
know
let
me
see
perhaps
i
have
and
she
put
her
hand
into
her
pocket
sure
enough
there
a
letter
clover
could
help
suspecting
that
imogen
knew
it
all
the
time
the
brigand
seemed
to
write
a
bold
black
hand
and
his
and
envelope
was
just
like
anybody
else
but
perhaps
his
band
had
surprised
a
pedlar
with
a
box
of
stationery
let
me
see
said
imogen
running
her
eye
down
the
page
imogen
that
would
interest
you
hm
hm
hm
ah
here
something
took
dinner
at
the
rock
house
on
christmas
it
was
lonesome
without
you
i
had
roast
turkey
roast
goose
roast
beef
mince
pie
plum
pudding
and
nuts
and
raisins
a
pretty
good
dinner
was
it
not
but
nothing
tastes
when
friends
are
away
katy
and
clover
stared
as
well
they
might
such
language
from
a
brigand
john
billings
has
bought
a
new
horse
continued
imogen
hm
hm
hm
him
i
do
think
there
is
anything
else
you
care
about
oh
yes
just
here
at
the
end
is
some
poetry
little
dove
with
azure
wing
and
brood
upon
my
breast
that
sweet
ai
it
has
he
reformed
said
clover
he
writes
as
if
he
had
reformed
cried
imogen
with
a
toss
of
the
jingling
he
was
always
just
as
good
as
he
could
be
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
in
reply
to
this
katy
felt
her
lips
twitch
and
for
fear
she
should
be
rude
and
laugh
out
she
began
to
talk
as
fast
as
she
could
about
something
else
all
the
time
she
found
herself
taking
measure
of
imogen
and
thinking
did
i
ever
really
like
her
how
queer
oh
what
a
wise
man
papa
is
imogen
stayed
half
an
hour
then
she
took
her
leave
she
never
asked
how
you
were
cried
elsie
indignantly
i
noticed
and
she
did
not
once
oh
well
i
suppose
she
forgot
we
were
talking
about
her
not
about
me
replied
katy
the
little
group
settled
down
again
to
their
work
this
time
half
an
hour
went
by
without
any
more
interruptions
then
the
door
bell
rang
and
bridget
with
a
disturbed
face
came
up
stairs
miss
katy
she
said
it
old
worrett
and
i
reckon
come
to
spend
the
day
for
she
brought
her
bag
what
ever
shall
i
tell
her
katy
looked
dismayed
oh
dear
she
said
how
unlucky
what
can
we
do
worrett
was
an
old
friend
of
aunt
izzie
who
lived
in
the
country
about
six
miles
from
burnet
and
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
carr
for
lunch
on
days
when
shopping
or
other
business
brought
her
into
town
this
did
not
occur
often
and
as
it
happened
katy
had
never
had
to
entertain
her
before
tell
her
ye
busy
and
ca
see
her
suggested
bridget
there
no
dinner
nor
nothing
you
know
the
katy
of
two
years
ago
would
probably
have
jumped
at
this
idea
but
the
katy
of
was
more
considerate
she
said
i
do
like
to
do
that
we
must
just
make
the
best
of
it
bridget
run
down
clover
dear
that
a
good
girl
and
tell
worrett
that
the
is
all
in
confusion
but
that
we
going
to
have
lunch
here
and
after
she
rested
i
should
be
glad
to
have
her
come
up
and
oh
clovy
give
her
a
fan
the
first
thing
she
be
hot
bridget
you
can
bring
up
the
luncheon
just
the
same
only
take
out
some
canned
peaches
by
way
of
a
dessert
and
make
worrett
a
cup
of
tea
she
drinks
tea
always
i
believe
i
ca
bear
to
send
the
poor
old
lady
away
when
she
has
come
so
far
she
explained
to
elsie
after
the
others
were
gone
pull
the
a
little
this
way
elsie
and
oh
push
all
those
little
chairs
back
against
the
wall
worrett
broke
down
in
one
the
last
time
she
was
here
do
you
recollect
it
took
some
time
to
cool
worrett
off
so
nearly
twenty
minutes
passed
before
a
heavy
creaking
step
on
the
stairs
announced
that
the
guest
was
on
her
way
up
elsie
began
to
giggle
worrett
always
made
her
giggle
katy
had
just
time
to
give
her
a
warning
glance
before
the
door
opened
worrett
was
the
most
enormously
fat
person
ever
seen
nobody
dared
to
guess
how
much
she
weighed
but
she
looked
as
if
it
might
be
a
thousand
pounds
her
face
was
extremely
red
in
the
coldest
weather
she
appeared
hot
and
on
a
mild
day
she
seemed
absolutely
ready
to
melt
her
were
flying
loose
as
she
came
in
and
she
fanned
herself
all
the
way
across
the
room
which
shook
as
she
walked
well
my
dear
she
said
as
she
plumped
herself
into
the
and
how
do
you
do
very
well
thank
you
replied
katy
thinking
that
she
never
saw
worrett
look
half
so
fat
before
and
wondering
how
she
to
entertain
her
and
how
your
pa
inquired
worrett
katy
answered
politely
and
then
asked
after
worrett
own
health
well
i
so
to
be
round
was
the
reply
which
had
the
effect
of
sending
elsie
off
into
a
fit
of
convulsive
laughter
behind
katy
chair
i
had
business
at
the
bank
continued
the
visitor
and
i
thought
while
i
was
about
it
i
step
up
to
miss
petingill
and
see
if
i
could
get
her
to
come
and
let
out
my
black
silk
it
was
made
quite
a
piece
back
and
i
seem
to
have
fleshed
up
since
then
for
i
ca
make
the
hooks
and
eyes
meet
at
all
but
when
i
got
there
she
was
out
so
i
my
walk
for
nothing
do
you
know
where
she
sewing
now
no
said
katy
feeling
her
chair
shake
and
keeping
her
own
countenance
with
difficulty
she
was
here
for
three
days
last
week
to
make
johnnie
a
but
i
have
heard
anything
about
her
since
elsie
do
you
want
to
run
down
stairs
and
ask
bridget
to
bring
a
a
a
glass
of
iced
water
for
worrett
she
looks
warm
after
her
walk
elsie
dreadfully
ashamed
made
a
bolt
from
the
room
and
hid
herself
in
the
hall
closet
to
have
her
laugh
out
she
came
back
after
a
while
with
a
perfectly
straight
face
luncheon
was
brought
up
worrett
made
a
good
meal
and
seemed
to
enjoy
everything
she
was
so
comfortable
that
she
never
stirred
till
four
oh
how
long
that
afternoon
did
seem
to
the
poor
girls
sitting
there
and
trying
to
think
of
something
to
say
to
their
vast
visitor
at
last
worrett
got
out
of
her
chair
and
prepared
to
depart
well
she
said
tying
her
i
had
a
good
rest
and
feel
all
the
better
for
it
ai
some
of
you
young
folks
coming
out
to
see
me
one
of
these
days
i
like
to
have
you
if
you
will
every
girl
would
know
how
to
take
care
of
a
fat
old
woman
and
make
her
feel
to
home
as
you
have
me
katy
i
wish
your
aunt
could
see
you
all
as
you
are
now
she
be
right
pleased
i
know
that
somehow
this
sentence
rang
pleasantly
in
katy
ears
ah
do
laugh
at
her
she
said
later
in
the
evening
when
the
children
after
their
tea
in
the
clean
were
come
up
to
sit
with
her
and
cecy
in
her
pretty
pink
lawn
and
white
shawl
had
dropped
in
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
she
a
real
kind
old
woman
and
i
do
like
to
have
you
it
is
her
fault
that
she
fat
and
aunt
izzie
was
fond
of
her
you
know
it
is
doing
something
for
her
when
we
can
show
a
little
attention
to
one
of
her
friends
i
was
sorry
when
she
came
but
now
it
over
i
glad
it
feels
so
nice
when
it
stops
aching
quoted
elsie
mischievously
while
cecy
whispered
to
clover
is
katy
sweet
is
she
replied
clover
i
wish
i
was
half
so
good
sometimes
i
think
i
shall
really
be
sorry
if
she
ever
gets
well
she
such
a
dear
old
darling
to
us
all
sitting
there
in
her
chair
that
it
would
seem
so
nice
to
have
her
anywhere
else
but
then
i
know
it
horrid
in
me
and
i
do
believe
she
be
different
or
grow
and
horrid
like
some
of
the
girls
even
if
she
were
well
of
course
she
would
replied
cecy
chapter
xiii
at
last
it
was
about
six
weeks
after
this
that
one
day
clover
and
elsie
were
busy
down
stairs
they
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
katy
bell
ringing
in
a
sudden
and
agitated
manner
both
ran
up
two
steps
at
a
time
to
see
what
was
wanted
katy
sat
in
her
chair
looking
very
much
flushed
and
excited
oh
girls
she
exclaimed
what
do
you
think
i
stood
up
what
cried
clover
and
elsie
i
really
did
i
stood
up
on
my
feet
by
myself
the
others
were
too
much
astonished
to
speak
so
katy
went
on
explaining
it
was
all
at
once
you
see
suddenly
i
had
the
feeling
that
if
i
tried
i
could
and
almost
before
i
thought
i
try
and
there
i
was
up
and
out
of
the
chair
only
i
kept
hold
of
the
arm
all
the
time
i
do
know
how
i
got
back
i
was
so
frightened
oh
girls
and
katy
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
do
you
think
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
do
it
again
she
asked
looking
up
with
wet
eyes
why
of
course
you
will
said
clover
while
elsie
danced
about
crying
out
anxiously
be
careful
do
be
careful
katy
tried
but
the
spring
was
gone
she
could
not
move
out
of
the
chair
at
all
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
had
dreamed
the
whole
thing
but
next
day
when
clover
happened
to
be
in
the
room
she
heard
a
sudden
exclamation
and
turning
there
stood
katy
absolutely
on
her
feet
papa
papa
shrieked
clover
rushing
down
stairs
dorry
john
elsie
come
come
and
see
papa
was
out
but
all
the
rest
crowded
up
at
once
this
time
katy
found
no
trouble
in
doing
it
again
it
seemed
as
if
her
will
had
been
asleep
and
now
that
it
had
waked
up
the
limbs
recognized
its
orders
and
obeyed
them
when
papa
came
in
he
was
as
much
excited
as
any
of
the
children
he
walked
round
and
round
the
chair
questioning
katy
and
making
her
stand
up
and
sit
down
am
i
really
going
to
get
well
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
yes
my
love
i
think
you
are
replied
carr
seizing
phil
and
giving
him
a
toss
into
the
air
none
of
the
children
had
ever
before
seen
papa
behave
so
like
a
boy
but
pretty
soon
noticing
katy
burning
cheeks
and
excited
eyes
he
calmed
himself
sent
the
others
all
away
and
sat
down
to
soothe
and
quiet
her
with
gentle
words
i
think
it
is
coming
my
darling
he
said
but
it
will
take
time
and
you
must
have
a
great
deal
of
patience
after
being
such
a
good
child
all
the
years
i
am
sure
you
wo
fail
now
remember
any
imprudence
will
put
you
back
you
must
be
content
to
gain
a
very
little
at
a
time
there
is
no
royal
road
to
walking
any
more
than
there
is
to
learning
every
baby
finds
that
out
oh
papa
said
katy
it
no
matter
if
it
takes
a
year
if
only
i
get
well
at
last
how
happy
she
was
that
night
too
happy
to
sleep
papa
noticed
the
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
in
the
morning
and
shook
his
head
you
must
be
careful
he
told
her
or
you
be
laid
up
again
a
course
of
fever
would
put
you
back
for
years
katy
knew
papa
was
right
and
she
was
careful
though
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
be
so
with
that
new
life
tingling
in
every
limb
her
progress
was
slow
as
carr
had
predicted
at
first
she
only
stood
on
her
feet
a
few
seconds
then
a
minute
then
five
minutes
holding
tightly
all
the
while
by
the
chair
next
she
ventured
to
let
go
the
chair
and
stand
alone
after
that
she
began
to
walk
a
step
at
a
time
pushing
a
chair
before
her
as
children
do
when
they
are
learning
the
use
of
their
feet
clover
and
elsie
hovered
about
her
as
she
moved
like
anxious
mammas
it
was
droll
and
a
little
pitiful
to
see
tall
katy
with
her
feeble
unsteady
progress
and
the
active
figures
of
the
little
sisters
following
her
protectingly
but
katy
did
not
consider
it
either
droll
or
pitiful
to
her
it
was
simply
delightful
the
most
delightful
thing
possible
no
baby
of
a
year
old
was
ever
prouder
of
his
first
steps
than
she
gradually
she
grew
adventurous
and
ventured
on
a
bolder
flight
clover
running
up
stairs
one
day
to
her
own
room
stood
transfixed
at
the
sight
of
katy
sitting
there
flushed
panting
but
enjoying
the
surprise
she
caused
you
see
she
explained
in
an
apologizing
tone
i
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
explore
it
is
such
a
time
since
i
saw
any
room
but
my
own
but
oh
dear
how
long
that
hall
is
i
had
forgotten
it
could
be
so
long
i
shall
have
to
take
a
good
rest
before
i
go
back
katy
did
take
a
good
rest
but
she
was
very
tired
next
day
the
experiment
however
did
no
harm
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
weeks
she
was
able
to
walk
all
over
the
second
story
this
was
a
great
enjoyment
it
was
like
reading
an
interesting
book
to
see
all
the
new
things
and
the
little
changes
she
was
forever
wondering
over
something
why
dorry
she
would
say
what
a
pretty
when
did
you
get
it
that
old
thing
why
i
had
it
two
years
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
it
perhaps
you
did
katy
would
reply
but
you
see
i
never
saw
it
before
so
it
made
no
impression
by
the
end
of
august
she
was
grown
so
strong
that
she
began
to
talk
about
going
down
stairs
but
papa
said
wait
it
will
tire
you
much
more
than
walking
about
on
a
level
he
explained
you
had
better
put
it
off
a
little
while
till
you
are
quite
sure
of
your
feet
i
think
so
too
said
clover
and
beside
i
want
to
have
the
house
all
put
in
order
and
made
nice
before
your
sharp
eyes
see
it
housekeeper
oh
i
tell
you
such
a
beautiful
idea
has
come
into
my
head
you
shall
fix
a
day
to
come
down
katy
and
we
be
all
ready
for
you
and
have
a
among
ourselves
that
would
be
just
lovely
how
soon
may
she
papa
well
in
ten
days
i
should
say
it
might
be
safe
ten
days
that
will
bring
it
to
the
seventh
of
september
wo
it
said
katy
then
papa
if
i
may
i
come
down
stairs
the
first
time
on
the
eighth
it
was
mamma
birthday
you
know
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
so
it
was
settled
how
delicious
cried
clover
skipping
about
and
clapping
her
hands
i
never
never
never
hear
of
anything
so
perfectly
lovely
papa
when
are
you
coming
down
stairs
i
want
to
speak
to
you
right
away
rather
than
have
my
pulled
off
answered
carr
laughing
and
they
went
away
together
katy
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
in
a
peaceful
happy
mood
oh
she
thought
can
it
really
be
is
school
going
to
out
just
as
cousin
helen
hymn
said
am
i
going
to
a
sweet
to
pain
but
there
was
love
in
the
pain
i
see
it
now
how
good
the
dear
teacher
has
been
to
me
clover
seemed
to
be
very
busy
all
the
rest
of
that
week
she
was
having
windows
washed
she
said
but
this
explanation
hardly
accounted
for
her
long
absences
and
the
mysterious
exultation
on
her
face
not
to
mention
certain
sounds
of
hammering
and
sawing
which
came
from
down
stairs
the
other
children
had
evidently
been
warned
to
say
nothing
for
once
or
twice
philly
broke
out
with
oh
katy
and
then
hushed
himself
up
saying
i
forgot
katy
grew
very
curious
but
she
saw
that
the
secret
whatever
it
was
gave
immense
satisfaction
to
everybody
except
herself
so
though
she
longed
to
know
she
concluded
not
to
spoil
the
fun
by
asking
any
questions
at
last
it
wanted
but
one
day
of
the
important
occasion
see
said
katy
as
clover
came
into
the
room
a
little
before
miss
petingill
has
brought
home
my
new
dress
i
going
to
wear
it
for
the
first
time
to
go
down
stairs
in
how
pretty
said
clover
examining
the
dress
which
was
a
soft
cashmere
trimmed
with
ribbon
of
the
same
shade
but
katy
i
came
up
to
shut
your
door
bridget
going
to
sweep
the
hall
and
i
do
want
the
dust
to
fly
in
because
your
room
was
brushed
this
morning
you
know
what
a
queer
time
to
sweep
a
hall
said
katy
wonderingly
why
you
make
her
wait
till
morning
oh
she
ca
there
are
she
has
i
mean
there
will
be
other
things
for
her
to
do
it
a
great
deal
more
convenient
that
she
should
do
it
now
do
worry
katy
darling
but
just
keep
your
door
shut
you
will
wo
you
promise
me
very
well
said
katy
more
and
more
amazed
but
yielding
to
eagerness
i
keep
it
shut
her
curiosity
was
excited
she
took
a
book
and
tried
to
read
but
the
letters
danced
up
and
down
before
her
eyes
and
she
could
help
listening
bridget
was
making
a
most
ostentatious
noise
with
her
broom
but
through
it
all
katy
seemed
to
hear
other
sounds
feet
on
the
stairs
doors
opening
and
shutting
once
a
stifled
giggle
how
queer
it
all
was
never
mind
she
said
resolutely
stopping
her
ears
i
shall
know
all
about
it
dawned
fresh
and
fair
the
very
ideal
of
a
september
day
katy
said
clover
as
she
came
in
from
the
garden
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
that
dress
of
yours
is
sweet
you
never
looked
so
nice
before
in
your
life
and
she
stuck
a
beautiful
carnation
pink
under
katy
and
fastened
another
in
her
hair
there
she
said
now
you
adorned
papa
is
coming
up
in
a
few
minutes
to
take
you
down
just
then
elsie
and
johnnie
came
in
they
had
on
their
best
frocks
so
had
clover
it
was
evidently
a
to
all
the
house
cecy
followed
invited
over
for
the
special
purpose
of
seeing
katy
walk
down
stairs
she
too
had
on
a
new
frock
how
fine
we
are
said
clover
as
she
remarked
this
magnificence
turn
round
cecy
a
panier
i
do
declare
and
a
sash
you
are
getting
awfully
grown
up
miss
hall
none
of
us
will
ever
be
so
up
as
katy
said
cecy
laughing
and
now
papa
appeared
very
slowly
they
all
went
down
stairs
katy
leaning
on
papa
with
dorry
on
her
other
side
and
the
girls
behind
while
philly
clattered
ahead
and
there
were
debby
and
bridget
and
alexander
peeping
out
of
the
kitchen
door
to
watch
her
and
dear
old
mary
with
her
apron
at
her
eyes
crying
for
joy
oh
the
front
door
is
open
said
katy
in
a
delighted
tone
how
nice
and
what
a
pretty
that
new
since
i
was
here
do
stop
to
look
at
cried
philly
who
seemed
in
a
great
hurry
about
something
it
is
new
it
been
there
ever
and
ever
so
long
come
into
the
parlor
instead
yes
said
papa
dinner
is
quite
ready
yet
you
have
time
to
rest
a
little
after
your
walk
down
stairs
you
have
borne
it
admirably
katy
are
you
very
tired
not
a
bit
replied
katy
cheerfully
i
could
do
it
alone
i
think
oh
the
bookcase
door
has
been
mended
how
nice
it
looks
do
wait
oh
do
wait
repeated
phil
in
an
agony
of
impatience
so
they
moved
on
papa
opened
the
parlor
door
katy
took
one
step
into
the
room
then
stopped
the
color
flashed
over
her
face
and
she
held
by
the
to
support
herself
what
was
it
that
she
saw
not
merely
the
room
itself
with
its
fresh
muslin
curtains
and
vases
of
flowers
nor
even
the
wide
beautiful
window
which
had
been
cut
toward
the
sun
or
the
inviting
little
couch
and
table
which
stood
there
evidently
for
her
no
there
was
something
else
the
sofa
was
pulled
out
and
there
upon
it
supported
by
pillows
her
bright
eyes
turned
to
the
door
lay
cousin
helen
when
she
saw
katy
she
held
out
her
arms
clover
and
cecy
agreed
afterward
that
they
never
were
so
frightened
in
their
lives
as
at
this
moment
for
katy
forgetting
her
weakness
let
go
of
papa
arm
and
absolutely
toward
the
sofa
oh
cousin
helen
dear
dear
cousin
helen
she
cried
then
she
tumbled
down
by
the
sofa
somehow
the
two
pairs
of
arms
and
the
two
faces
met
and
for
a
moment
or
two
not
a
word
more
was
heard
from
anybody
is
a
nice
shouted
philly
turning
a
somerset
by
way
of
relieving
his
feelings
while
john
and
dorry
executed
a
sort
of
round
the
sofa
phil
voice
seemed
to
break
the
spell
of
silence
and
a
perfect
hubbub
of
questions
and
exclamations
began
it
appeared
that
this
happy
thought
of
getting
cousin
helen
to
the
celebration
was
clover
she
it
was
who
had
proposed
it
to
papa
and
made
all
the
arrangements
and
artful
puss
she
had
set
bridget
to
sweep
the
hall
on
purpose
that
katy
might
not
hear
the
noise
of
the
arrival
cousin
helen
going
to
stay
three
weeks
this
time
is
that
nice
asked
elsie
while
clover
anxiously
questioned
are
you
sure
that
you
did
suspect
not
one
bit
not
the
least
tiny
weeny
mite
no
indeed
not
the
least
how
could
i
suspect
anything
so
perfectly
delightful
and
katy
gave
cousin
helen
another
rapturous
kiss
such
a
short
day
as
that
seemed
there
was
so
much
to
see
to
ask
about
to
talk
over
that
the
hours
flew
and
evening
dropped
upon
them
all
like
another
great
surprise
cousin
helen
was
perhaps
the
happiest
of
the
party
beside
the
pleasure
of
knowing
katy
to
be
almost
well
again
she
had
the
additional
enjoyment
of
seeing
for
herself
how
many
changes
for
the
better
had
taken
place
during
the
four
years
among
the
little
cousins
she
loved
so
much
it
was
very
interesting
to
watch
them
all
elsie
and
dorry
seemed
to
her
the
most
improved
of
the
family
elsie
had
quite
lost
her
plaintive
look
and
little
injured
tone
and
was
as
bright
and
beaming
a
maiden
of
twelve
as
any
one
could
wish
to
see
dorry
moody
face
had
grown
open
and
sensible
and
his
manners
were
and
obliging
he
was
still
a
sober
boy
and
not
specially
quick
in
catching
an
idea
but
he
promised
to
turn
out
a
valuable
man
and
to
him
as
to
all
the
other
children
katy
was
evidently
the
centre
and
the
sun
they
all
revolved
about
her
and
trusted
her
for
everything
cousin
helen
looked
on
as
phil
came
in
crying
after
a
hard
tumble
and
was
consoled
as
johnnie
whispered
an
important
secret
and
elsie
begged
for
help
in
her
work
she
saw
katy
meet
them
all
pleasantly
and
sweetly
without
a
bit
of
the
dictatorial
in
her
manner
and
with
none
of
her
old
impetuous
tone
and
best
of
all
she
saw
the
change
in
katy
own
face
the
gentle
expression
of
her
eyes
the
womanly
look
the
pleasant
voice
the
politeness
the
tact
in
advising
the
others
without
seeming
to
advise
dear
katy
she
said
a
day
or
two
after
her
arrival
this
visit
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
you
ca
think
how
great
it
is
such
a
contrast
to
the
last
i
made
when
you
were
so
sick
and
everybody
so
sad
do
you
remember
indeed
i
do
and
how
good
you
were
and
how
you
helped
me
i
shall
never
forget
that
i
glad
but
what
i
could
do
was
very
little
you
have
been
learning
by
yourself
all
this
time
and
katy
darling
i
want
to
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
to
see
how
bravely
you
have
worked
your
way
up
i
can
perceive
it
in
everything
in
papa
in
the
children
in
yourself
you
have
won
the
place
which
you
recollect
i
once
told
you
an
invalid
should
try
to
gain
of
being
to
everybody
heart
of
the
house
oh
cousin
helen
do
said
katy
her
eyes
filling
with
sudden
tears
i
have
been
brave
you
ca
think
how
badly
i
sometimes
have
behaved
how
cross
and
ungrateful
i
am
and
how
stupid
and
slow
every
day
i
see
things
which
ought
to
be
done
and
i
do
do
them
it
too
delightful
to
have
you
praise
me
but
you
must
i
do
deserve
it
but
although
she
said
she
did
deserve
it
i
think
that
katy
did
