pansies
poppies
and

little
and
preface
these
stories
were
written
for
my
own
amusement
during
a
period
of
enforced
seclusion
the
flowers
which
were
my
solace
and
pleasure
suggested
titles
for
the
tales
and
gave
an
interest
to
the
work
if
my
girls
find
a
little
beauty
or
sunshine
in
these
common
blossoms
their
old
friend
will
not
have
made
her
garland
in
vain
alcott
september
may
flowers
being
boston
girls
of
course
they
got
up
a
club
for
mental
improvement
and
as
they
were
all
descendants
of
the
pilgrim
fathers
they
called
it
the
mayflower
club
a
very
good
name
and
the
six
young
girls
who
were
members
of
it
made
a
very
pretty
posy
when
they
met
together
once
a
week
to
sew
and
read
books
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
season
after
being
separated
all
summer
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gossip
to
be
attended
to
before
the
question
what
shall
we
read
came
up
for
serious
discussion
anna
winslow
as
president
began
by
proposing
happy
dodd
but
a
chorus
of
i
read
it
made
her
turn
to
her
list
for
another
title
of
poverty
is
all
about
workingwomen
very
true
and
very
sad
but
mamma
said
it
might
do
us
good
to
know
something
of
the
hard
times
other
girls
have
said
anna
soberly
for
she
was
a
thoughtful
creature
very
anxious
to
do
her
duty
in
all
ways
i
rather
not
know
about
sad
things
since
i
ca
help
to
make
them
any
better
answered
ella
carver
softly
patting
the
apple
blossoms
she
was
embroidering
on
a
bit
of
blue
satin
but
we
might
help
if
we
really
tried
i
suppose
you
know
how
much
happy
dodd
did
when
she
once
began
and
she
was
only
a
poor
little
girl
without
half
the
means
of
doing
good
which
we
have
said
anna
glad
to
discuss
the
matter
for
she
had
a
little
plan
in
her
head
and
wanted
to
prepare
a
way
for
proposing
it
yes
i
always
saying
that
i
have
more
than
my
share
of
fun
and
comfort
and
pretty
things
and
that
i
ought
and
will
share
them
with
some
one
but
i
do
do
it
and
now
and
then
when
i
hear
about
real
poverty
or
dreadful
sickness
i
feel
so
wicked
it
quite
upsets
me
if
i
knew
how
to
begin
i
really
would
but
dirty
little
children
do
come
in
my
way
nor
tipsy
women
to
be
reformed
nor
nice
lame
girls
to
sing
and
pray
with
as
it
all
happens
in
books
cried
marion
warren
with
such
a
remorseful
expression
on
her
merry
round
face
that
her
mates
laughed
with
one
accord
i
know
something
that
i
could
do
if
i
only
had
the
courage
to
begin
it
but
papa
would
shake
his
head
unbelievingly
and
mamma
worry
about
its
being
proper
and
it
would
interfere
with
my
music
and
everything
nice
that
i
especially
wanted
to
go
to
would
be
sure
to
come
on
whatever
day
i
set
for
my
good
work
and
i
should
get
discouraged
or
ashamed
and
not
half
do
it
so
i
do
begin
but
i
know
i
and
elizabeth
alden
rolled
her
large
eyes
from
one
friend
to
another
as
if
appealing
to
them
to
goad
her
to
this
duty
by
counsel
and
encouragement
of
some
sort
well
i
suppose
it
right
but
i
do
perfectly
hate
to
go
poking
round
among
poor
folks
smelling
bad
smells
seeing
dreadful
sights
hearing
woful
tales
and
running
the
risk
of
catching
fever
and
diphtheria
and
horrid
things
i
do
pretend
to
like
charity
but
say
right
out
i
a
silly
selfish
wretch
and
want
to
enjoy
every
minute
and
not
worry
about
other
people
is
it
shameful
maggie
bradford
looked
such
a
sweet
little
sinner
as
she
boldly
made
this
sad
confession
that
no
one
could
scold
her
though
ida
standish
her
bosom
friend
shook
her
head
and
anna
said
with
a
sigh
i
afraid
we
all
feel
very
much
as
maggie
does
though
we
do
own
it
so
honestly
last
spring
when
i
was
ill
and
thought
i
might
die
i
was
so
ashamed
of
my
idle
frivolous
winter
that
i
felt
as
if
i
give
all
i
had
to
be
able
to
live
it
over
and
do
better
much
is
not
expected
of
a
girl
of
eighteen
i
know
but
oh
there
were
heaps
of
kind
little
things
i
might
have
done
if
i
thought
only
of
myself
i
resolved
if
i
lived
i
try
at
least
to
be
less
selfish
and
make
some
one
happier
for
my
being
in
the
world
i
tell
you
girls
it
rather
solemn
when
you
lie
expecting
to
die
and
your
sins
come
up
before
you
even
though
they
are
very
small
ones
i
never
shall
forget
it
and
after
my
lovely
summer
i
mean
to
be
a
better
girl
and
lead
a
better
life
if
i
anna
was
so
much
in
earnest
that
her
words
straight
out
of
a
very
innocent
and
contrite
heart
touched
her
hearers
deeply
and
put
them
into
the
right
mood
to
embrace
her
proposition
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
then
maggie
said
quietly
i
know
what
it
is
i
felt
very
much
so
when
the
horses
ran
away
and
for
fifteen
minutes
i
sat
clinging
to
mamma
expecting
to
be
killed
every
unkind
undutiful
word
i
ever
said
to
her
came
back
to
me
and
was
worse
to
bear
than
the
fear
of
sudden
death
it
scared
a
great
deal
of
naughtiness
out
of
me
and
dear
mamma
and
i
have
been
more
to
each
other
ever
let
us
begin
with
prisoners
of
poverty
and
perhaps
it
will
show
us
something
to
do
said
lizzie
but
i
must
say
i
never
felt
as
if
needed
much
help
they
generally
seem
so
contented
with
themselves
and
so
pert
or
patronizing
to
us
that
i
do
pity
them
a
bit
though
it
must
be
a
hard
i
think
we
ca
do
much
in
that
direction
except
set
an
example
of
good
manners
when
we
go
shopping
i
wanted
to
propose
that
we
each
choose
some
small
charity
for
this
winter
and
do
it
faithfully
that
will
teach
us
how
to
do
more
by
and
by
and
we
can
help
one
another
with
our
experiences
perhaps
or
amuse
with
our
failures
what
do
you
say
asked
anna
surveying
her
five
friends
with
a
persuasive
smile
what
could
we
do
people
will
call
us
i
have
the
least
idea
how
to
go
to
do
believe
mamma
will
let
we
better
change
our
names
from
may
flowers
to
sisters
of
charity
and
wear
meek
black
bonnets
and
flapping
anna
received
these
replies
with
great
composure
and
waited
for
the
meeting
to
come
to
order
well
knowing
that
the
girls
would
have
their
fun
and
outcry
first
and
then
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
i
think
it
a
lovely
idea
and
i
carry
out
my
plan
but
i
tell
what
it
is
yet
you
all
shout
and
say
i
could
do
it
but
if
you
were
trying
also
that
would
keep
me
up
to
the
mark
said
lizzie
with
a
decided
snap
of
her
scissors
as
she
trimmed
the
edges
of
a
plush
case
for
her
beloved
music
suppose
we
all
keep
our
attempts
secret
and
not
let
our
right
hand
know
what
the
left
hand
does
it
such
fun
to
mystify
people
and
then
no
one
can
laugh
at
us
if
we
fail
we
can
say
nothing
if
we
succeed
we
can
tell
of
it
and
get
our
reward
i
like
that
way
and
will
look
round
at
once
for
some
especially
horrid
ungrateful
old
woman
or
ugly
child
and
devote
myself
to
him
her
or
it
with
the
patience
of
a
saint
cried
maggie
caught
by
the
idea
of
doing
good
in
secret
and
being
found
out
by
accident
the
other
girls
agreed
after
some
discussion
and
then
anna
took
the
floor
again
i
propose
that
we
each
work
in
our
own
way
till
next
may
then
at
our
last
meeting
report
what
we
have
done
truly
and
honestly
and
plan
something
better
for
next
year
is
it
a
vote
it
evidently
was
a
unanimous
vote
for
five
gold
thimbles
went
up
and
five
blooming
faces
smiled
as
the
five
girlish
voices
cried
aye
very
well
now
let
us
decide
what
to
read
and
begin
at
once
i
think
the
a
good
book
and
we
shall
doubtless
get
some
hints
from
so
they
began
and
for
an
hour
one
pleasant
voice
after
the
other
read
aloud
those
sad
true
stories
of
workingwomen
and
their
hard
lives
showing
these
gay
young
creatures
what
their
pretty
clothes
cost
the
real
makers
of
them
and
how
much
injustice
suffering
and
wasted
strength
went
into
them
it
was
very
sober
reading
but
most
absorbing
for
the
crochet
needles
went
slower
and
slower
the
lay
idle
and
a
great
tear
shone
like
a
drop
of
dew
on
the
apple
blossoms
as
ella
listened
to
rose
they
skipped
the
statistics
and
dipped
here
and
there
as
each
took
her
turn
but
when
the
two
hours
were
over
and
it
was
time
for
the
club
to
adjourn
all
the
members
were
deeply
interested
in
that
pathetic
book
and
more
in
earnest
than
before
for
this
glimpse
into
other
lives
showed
them
how
much
help
was
needed
and
made
them
anxious
to
lend
a
hand
we
ca
do
much
being
girls
said
anna
but
if
each
does
one
small
chore
somewhere
it
will
pave
the
way
for
better
work
so
we
will
all
try
at
least
though
it
seems
like
so
many
ants
trying
to
move
a
well
ants
build
nests
higher
than
a
man
head
in
africa
you
remember
the
picture
of
them
in
our
old
geographies
and
we
can
do
as
much
i
sure
if
each
tugs
her
pebble
or
straw
faithfully
i
shall
shoulder
mine
if
mamma
is
willing
answered
lizzie
shutting
up
her
as
if
she
had
her
resolution
inside
and
was
afraid
it
might
evaporate
before
she
got
home
i
shall
stand
on
the
common
and
proclaim
aloud
a
nice
young
missionary
in
want
of
a
job
charity
for
sale
cheap
buy
who
buy
said
maggie
with
a
resigned
expression
and
a
sanctimonious
twang
to
her
voice
i
shall
wait
and
see
what
comes
to
me
since
i
do
know
what
fit
for
and
marion
gazed
out
of
the
window
as
if
expecting
to
see
some
interesting
pauper
waiting
for
her
to
appear
i
shall
ask
miss
bliss
for
advice
she
knows
all
about
the
poor
and
will
give
me
a
good
start
added
prudent
ida
who
resolved
to
do
nothing
rashly
lest
she
should
fail
i
shall
probably
have
a
class
of
dirty
little
girls
and
teach
them
how
to
sew
as
i
ca
do
anything
else
they
wo
learn
much
but
steal
and
break
and
mess
and
be
a
dreadful
trial
and
i
shall
get
laughed
at
and
wish
i
had
done
it
still
i
shall
try
it
and
sacrifice
my
to
the
cause
of
virtue
said
ella
carefully
putting
away
her
satin
with
a
fond
glance
at
the
delicate
flowers
she
so
loved
to
embroider
i
have
no
plans
but
want
to
do
so
much
i
shall
have
to
wait
till
i
discover
what
is
best
after
we
wo
speak
of
our
work
or
it
wo
be
a
secret
any
longer
in
may
we
will
report
good
luck
to
all
and
till
next
with
these
farewell
words
from
their
president
the
girls
departed
with
great
plans
and
new
ideas
simmering
in
their
young
heads
and
hearts
it
seemed
a
vast
undertaking
but
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
always
a
way
and
soon
it
was
evident
that
each
had
found
a
little
chore
to
do
for
sweet
charity
sake
not
a
word
was
said
at
the
weekly
meetings
but
the
artless
faces
betrayed
all
shades
of
hope
discouragement
pride
and
doubt
as
their
various
attempts
seemed
likely
to
succeed
or
fail
much
curiosity
was
felt
and
a
few
accidental
words
hints
or
meetings
in
queer
places
were
very
exciting
though
nothing
was
discovered
marion
was
often
seen
in
a
north
end
car
and
lizzie
in
a
south
end
car
with
a
bag
of
books
and
papers
ella
haunted
a
certain
shop
where
fancy
articles
were
sold
and
ida
always
brought
plain
sewing
to
the
club
maggie
seemed
very
busy
at
home
and
anna
was
found
writing
industriously
several
times
when
one
of
her
friends
called
all
seemed
very
happy
and
rather
important
when
outsiders
questioned
them
about
their
affairs
but
they
had
their
pleasures
as
usual
and
seemed
to
enjoy
them
with
an
added
relish
as
if
they
realized
as
never
before
how
many
blessings
they
possessed
and
were
grateful
for
them
so
the
winter
passed
and
slowly
something
new
and
pleasant
seemed
to
come
into
the
lives
of
these
young
girls
the
listless
discontented
look
some
of
them
used
to
wear
passed
away
a
sweet
earnestness
and
a
cheerful
activity
made
them
charming
though
they
did
not
know
it
and
wondered
when
people
said
that
set
of
girls
are
growing
up
beautifully
they
will
make
fine
women
by
and
the
mayflowers
were
budding
under
the
snow
and
as
spring
came
on
the
fresh
perfume
began
to
steal
out
the
rosy
faces
to
brighten
and
the
last
year
dead
leaves
to
fall
away
leaving
the
young
plants
green
and
strong
on
the
of
may
the
club
met
for
the
last
time
that
season
as
some
left
town
early
and
all
were
full
of
spring
work
and
summer
plans
every
member
was
in
her
place
at
an
unusually
early
hour
that
day
and
each
wore
an
air
of
mingled
anxiety
expectation
and
satisfaction
pleasant
to
behold
anna
called
them
to
order
with
three
raps
of
her
thimble
and
a
beaming
smile
we
need
not
choose
a
book
for
our
reading
as
each
of
us
is
to
contribute
an
original
history
of
her
winter
work
i
know
it
will
be
very
interesting
and
i
hope
more
instructive
than
some
of
the
novels
we
have
read
who
shall
begin
you
you
was
the
unanimous
answer
for
all
loved
and
respected
her
very
much
and
felt
that
their
presiding
officer
should
open
the
ball
anna
colored
modestly
but
surprised
her
friends
by
the
composure
with
which
she
related
her
little
story
quite
as
if
used
to
public
speaking
you
know
i
told
you
last
november
that
i
should
have
to
look
about
for
something
that
i
could
do
i
did
look
a
long
time
and
was
rather
in
despair
when
my
task
came
to
me
in
the
most
unexpected
way
our
winter
work
was
being
done
so
i
had
a
good
deal
of
shopping
on
my
hands
and
found
it
less
a
bore
than
usual
because
i
liked
to
watch
the
and
wish
i
dared
ask
some
of
them
if
i
could
help
them
i
went
often
to
get
trimmings
and
buttons
at
cotton
and
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
two
girls
at
that
counter
they
were
very
obliging
and
patient
about
matching
some
jet
ornaments
for
mamma
and
i
found
out
that
their
names
were
mary
and
maria
porter
i
liked
them
for
they
were
very
neat
and
plain
in
their
dress
not
like
some
who
seem
to
think
that
if
their
waists
are
small
and
their
hair
dressed
in
the
fashion
it
is
no
matter
how
soiled
their
collars
are
nor
how
untidy
their
nails
well
one
day
when
i
went
for
certain
kinds
of
buttons
which
were
to
be
made
for
us
maria
the
younger
one
who
took
the
order
was
not
there
i
asked
for
her
and
mary
said
she
was
at
home
with
a
lame
knee
i
was
so
sorry
and
ventured
to
put
a
few
questions
in
a
friendly
way
mary
seemed
glad
to
tell
her
troubles
and
i
found
that
as
she
called
her
sister
had
been
suffering
for
a
long
time
but
did
not
complain
for
fear
of
losing
her
place
no
stools
are
allowed
at
cotton
so
the
poor
girls
stand
nearly
all
day
or
rest
a
minute
now
and
then
on
a
drawer
i
seen
maria
doing
it
and
wondered
why
some
one
did
not
make
a
stir
about
seats
in
this
place
as
they
have
in
other
stores
and
got
stools
for
the
shop
women
i
did
dare
to
speak
to
the
gentlemen
but
i
gave
mary
the
jack
roses
i
wore
in
my
breast
and
asked
if
i
might
take
some
books
or
flowers
to
poor
maria
it
was
lovely
to
see
her
sad
face
light
up
and
hear
her
thank
me
when
i
went
to
see
her
for
she
was
very
lonely
without
her
sister
and
discouraged
about
her
place
she
did
not
lose
it
entirely
but
had
to
work
at
home
for
her
lame
knee
will
be
a
long
time
in
getting
well
i
begged
mamma
and
ailingham
to
speak
to
cotton
for
her
so
she
got
the
mending
of
the
jet
and
bead
work
to
do
and
buttons
to
cover
and
things
of
that
sort
mary
takes
them
to
and
fro
and
maria
feels
so
happy
not
to
be
idle
we
also
got
stools
for
all
the
other
girls
in
that
shop
allingham
is
so
rich
and
kind
she
can
do
anything
and
now
it
such
a
comfort
to
see
those
tired
things
resting
when
off
duty
that
i
often
go
in
and
enjoy
the
anna
paused
as
cries
of
good
good
interrupted
her
tale
but
she
did
not
add
the
prettiest
part
of
it
and
tell
how
the
faces
of
the
young
women
behind
the
counters
brightened
when
she
came
in
nor
how
gladly
all
served
the
young
lady
who
showed
them
what
a
true
gentlewoman
was
i
hope
that
is
all
said
maggie
eagerly
only
a
little
more
i
know
you
will
laugh
when
i
tell
you
that
been
reading
papers
to
a
class
of
at
the
union
once
a
week
all
a
murmur
of
awe
and
admiration
greeted
this
deeply
interesting
statement
for
true
to
the
traditions
of
the
modern
athens
in
which
they
lived
the
girls
all
felt
the
highest
respect
for
papers
on
any
subject
it
being
the
fashion
for
ladies
old
and
young
to
read
and
discuss
every
subject
from
pottery
to
pantheism
at
the
various
clubs
all
over
the
city
it
came
about
very
naturally
continued
anna
as
if
anxious
to
explain
her
seeming
audacity
i
used
to
go
to
see
molly
and
ria
and
heard
all
about
their
life
and
its
few
pleasures
and
learned
to
like
them
more
and
more
they
had
only
each
other
in
the
world
lived
in
two
rooms
worked
all
day
and
in
the
way
of
amusement
or
instruction
had
only
what
they
found
at
the
union
in
the
evening
i
went
with
them
a
few
times
and
saw
how
useful
and
pleasant
it
was
and
wanted
to
help
as
other
kind
girls
only
a
little
older
than
i
did
eva
randal
read
a
letter
from
a
friend
in
russia
one
time
and
the
girls
enjoyed
it
very
much
that
reminded
me
of
my
brother
george
lively
journals
written
when
he
was
abroad
you
remember
how
we
used
to
laugh
over
them
when
he
sent
them
home
well
when
i
was
begged
to
give
them
an
evening
i
resolved
to
try
one
of
those
amusing
and
chose
the
best
all
about
how
george
and
a
friend
went
to
the
different
places
dickens
describes
in
some
of
his
funny
books
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
how
those
dear
girls
enjoyed
it
and
laughed
till
they
cried
over
the
dismay
of
the
boys
when
they
knocked
at
a
door
in
kingsgate
street
and
asked
if
gamp
lived
there
it
was
actually
a
barber
shop
and
a
little
man
very
like
poll
sweedlepipes
told
them
britton
was
the
nuss
as
lived
there
now
it
upset
those
rascals
to
come
so
near
the
truth
and
they
ran
away
because
they
could
keep
the
members
of
the
club
indulged
in
a
general
smile
as
they
recalled
the
immortal
sairey
with
the
bottle
on
the
the
cowcuber
and
the
wooden
pippins
then
anna
continued
with
an
air
of
calm
satisfaction
quite
sure
now
of
her
audience
and
herself
it
was
a
great
success
so
i
went
on
and
when
the
journals
were
done
i
used
to
read
other
things
and
picked
up
books
for
their
library
and
helped
in
any
way
i
could
while
learning
to
know
them
better
and
give
them
confidence
in
me
they
are
proud
and
shy
just
as
we
should
be
but
if
you
really
want
to
be
friends
and
do
mind
rebuffs
now
and
then
they
come
to
trust
and
like
you
and
there
is
so
much
to
do
for
them
one
never
need
sit
idle
any
more
i
give
names
as
they
do
like
it
nor
tell
how
i
tried
to
serve
them
but
it
is
very
sweet
and
good
for
me
to
have
found
this
work
and
to
know
that
each
year
i
can
do
it
better
and
better
so
i
feel
encouraged
and
am
very
glad
i
began
as
i
hope
you
all
are
now
who
comes
next
as
anna
ended
the
needles
dropped
and
ten
soft
hands
gave
her
a
hearty
round
of
applause
for
all
felt
that
she
had
done
well
and
chosen
a
task
especially
fitted
to
her
powers
as
she
had
money
time
tact
and
the
winning
manners
that
make
friends
everywhere
beaming
with
pleasure
at
their
approval
but
feeling
that
they
made
too
much
of
her
small
success
anna
called
the
club
to
order
by
saying
ella
looks
as
if
she
were
anxious
to
tell
her
experiences
so
perhaps
we
had
better
ask
her
to
hold
forth
hear
hear
cried
the
girls
and
nothing
loath
ella
promptly
began
with
twinkling
eyes
and
a
demure
smile
for
her
story
ended
romantically
if
you
are
interested
in
miss
president
and
ladies
you
will
like
to
know
that
am
one
at
least
a
silent
partner
and
in
a
small
fancy
store
at
the
west
no
exclaimed
the
amazed
club
with
one
voice
and
satisfied
with
this
sensational
beginning
ella
went
on
i
really
am
and
you
have
bought
some
of
my
is
that
a
good
joke
you
need
stare
so
for
i
actually
made
that
anna
and
my
partner
knit
lizzie
new
cloud
this
is
the
way
it
all
happened
i
did
wish
to
waste
any
time
but
one
ca
rush
into
the
street
and
collar
shabby
little
girls
and
say
along
and
learn
to
sew
without
a
struggle
so
i
thought
go
and
ask
brown
how
to
begin
her
branch
of
the
associated
charities
is
in
laurel
street
not
far
from
our
house
you
know
and
the
very
day
after
our
last
meeting
i
posted
off
to
get
my
i
expected
to
have
to
fit
work
for
poor
needlewomen
or
go
to
see
some
dreadful
sick
creature
or
wash
dirty
little
pats
and
was
bracing
up
my
mind
for
whatever
might
come
as
i
toiled
up
the
hill
in
a
gale
of
wind
suddenly
my
hat
flew
off
and
went
gayly
skipping
away
to
the
great
delight
of
some
black
imps
who
only
grinned
and
cheered
me
on
as
i
trotted
after
it
with
wild
grabs
and
wrathful
dodges
i
got
it
at
last
out
of
a
puddle
and
there
i
was
in
a
nice
mess
the
elastic
was
broken
feather
wet
and
the
poor
thing
all
mud
and
dirt
i
did
care
much
as
it
was
my
old
one
dressed
for
my
work
you
see
but
i
could
go
home
bareheaded
and
i
know
a
soul
in
that
neighborhood
i
turned
to
step
into
a
grocery
store
at
the
corner
to
borrow
a
brush
or
buy
a
sheet
of
paper
to
wear
for
i
looked
like
a
lunatic
with
my
battered
hat
and
my
hair
in
a
perfect
mop
luckily
i
spied
a
woman
fancy
shop
on
the
other
corner
and
rushed
in
there
to
hide
myself
for
the
brats
hooted
and
people
stared
it
was
a
very
small
shop
and
behind
the
counter
sat
a
tall
thin
woman
making
a
baby
hood
she
looked
poor
and
blue
and
rather
sour
but
took
pity
on
me
and
while
she
sewed
the
cord
dried
the
feather
and
brushed
off
the
dirt
i
warmed
myself
and
looked
about
to
see
what
i
could
buy
in
return
for
her
trouble
a
few
children
aprons
hung
in
the
little
window
with
some
knit
lace
balls
and
garters
two
or
three
dolls
and
a
very
poor
display
of
small
wares
in
a
however
on
the
table
that
was
the
counter
i
found
some
really
pretty
things
made
of
plush
silk
and
ribbon
with
a
good
deal
of
taste
so
i
said
buy
a
and
a
gay
ball
and
a
pair
of
distracting
shoes
made
to
look
like
little
socks
with
pink
so
cunning
and
dainty
i
was
glad
to
get
them
for
cousin
clara
baby
the
woman
seemed
pleased
though
she
had
a
grim
way
of
talking
and
never
smiled
once
i
observed
that
she
handled
my
hat
as
if
used
to
such
work
and
evidently
liked
to
do
it
i
thanked
her
for
repairing
damages
so
quickly
and
well
and
she
said
with
my
hat
on
her
hand
as
if
she
hated
to
part
with
it
used
to
millineryin
and
never
should
have
give
it
up
if
i
did
have
my
folks
to
see
to
i
took
this
shop
hopin
to
make
things
go
as
such
a
place
was
needed
round
here
but
mother
broke
down
and
is
a
sight
of
care
so
i
could
leave
her
and
doctors
is
expensive
and
times
hard
and
i
had
to
drop
my
trade
and
fall
back
on
pins
and
needles
and
so
on
ella
was
a
capital
mimic
and
imitated
the
nasal
tones
of
the
vermont
woman
to
the
life
with
a
doleful
pucker
of
her
own
blooming
face
which
gave
such
a
truthful
picture
of
poor
miss
almira
miller
that
those
who
had
seen
her
recognized
it
at
once
and
laughed
gayly
just
as
i
was
murmuring
a
few
words
of
regret
at
her
bad
luck
continued
ella
a
sharp
voice
called
out
from
a
back
room
almiry
come
here
it
sounded
very
like
a
cross
parrot
but
it
was
the
old
lady
and
while
i
put
on
my
hat
i
heard
her
asking
who
was
in
the
shop
and
what
we
were
about
her
daughter
told
her
and
the
old
soul
demanded
to
the
gal
so
i
went
in
being
ready
for
fun
as
usual
it
was
a
little
dark
dismal
place
but
as
neat
as
a
pin
and
in
the
bed
sat
a
regular
grandma
smallweed
smoking
a
pipe
with
a
big
cap
a
and
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
she
was
a
tiny
thing
brown
as
a
berry
with
eyes
like
black
beads
a
nose
and
chin
that
nearly
met
and
hands
like
birds
claws
but
such
a
fierce
lively
curious
blunt
old
lady
you
never
saw
and
i
did
know
what
would
be
the
end
of
me
when
she
began
to
question
then
to
scold
and
finally
to
demand
that
should
come
and
trade
to
almiry
shop
after
they
would
and
she
havin
took
a
lease
of
the
place
on
account
of
them
lies
i
wanted
to
laugh
but
dared
not
do
it
so
just
let
her
croak
for
the
daughter
had
to
go
to
her
customers
the
old
tirade
informed
me
that
they
came
from
vermont
had
wal
on
till
father
died
and
the
farm
was
sold
then
it
seems
the
women
came
to
boston
and
got
on
pretty
well
till
stroke
of
whatever
that
is
made
the
mother
helpless
and
kept
almiry
at
home
to
care
for
her
i
ca
tell
you
how
funny
and
yet
how
sad
it
was
to
see
the
poor
old
soul
so
full
of
energy
and
yet
so
helpless
and
the
daughter
so
discouraged
with
her
pathetic
little
shop
and
no
customers
to
speak
of
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
till
miller
as
the
children
call
her
happened
to
say
when
she
took
up
her
knitting
after
the
lecture
folks
who
go
spendin
money
reckless
on
toys
for
christmas
only
knew
what
nice
things
useful
and
fancy
me
and
almiry
could
make
ef
we
had
the
goods
they
jest
come
round
this
corner
and
buy
and
keep
me
out
of
a
old
woman
home
and
that
good
gal
of
mine
out
of
a
for
go
there
she
will
ef
she
do
get
a
boost
somehow
with
rent
and
firin
and
vittles
all
on
her
shoulders
and
me
only
able
to
wag
them
will
buy
things
here
and
tell
all
my
friends
about
it
and
i
have
a
drawer
full
of
pretty
bits
of
silk
and
velvet
and
plush
that
i
will
give
miss
miller
for
her
work
if
she
will
let
me
i
added
that
for
i
saw
that
almiry
was
rather
proud
and
hid
her
troubles
under
a
grim
look
that
pleased
the
old
lady
and
lowering
her
voice
she
said
with
a
motherly
sort
of
look
in
her
beady
eyes
as
you
are
so
friendly
i
tell
you
what
frets
me
most
a
layin
here
a
burden
to
my
darter
she
kep
company
with
nathan
baxter
a
master
carpenter
up
to
westminster
where
we
lived
and
ef
father
had
a
died
suddin
they
a
ben
married
they
waited
a
number
o
years
workin
to
their
trades
and
we
was
hopin
all
would
turn
out
wal
when
troubles
come
and
here
we
be
nathan
got
his
own
folks
to
see
to
and
almiry
wo
add
to
his
load
with
hern
nor
leave
me
so
she
give
him
back
his
ring
and
jest
buckled
to
all
alone
she
say
a
word
but
it
wearin
her
to
a
shadder
and
i
ca
do
a
thing
to
help
but
make
a
few
pinballs
knit
garters
and
kiver
holders
ef
she
got
a
start
in
business
it
would
cheer
her
up
a
sight
and
give
her
a
kind
of
a
hopeful
prospeck
for
old
folks
ca
live
forever
and
nathan
is
a
waitin
faithful
and
true
that
just
finished
me
for
i
am
romantic
and
do
enjoy
love
stories
with
all
my
heart
even
if
the
lovers
are
only
a
skinny
spinster
and
a
master
carpenter
so
i
just
resolved
to
see
what
i
could
do
for
poor
almiry
and
the
peppery
old
lady
i
did
promise
anything
but
my
bits
and
taking
the
things
i
bought
went
home
to
talk
it
over
with
mamma
i
found
she
had
often
got
pins
and
tape
and
such
small
wares
at
the
little
shop
and
found
it
very
convenient
though
she
knew
nothing
about
the
millers
she
was
willing
i
should
help
if
i
could
but
advised
going
slowly
and
seeing
what
they
could
do
first
we
did
not
dare
to
treat
them
like
beggars
and
send
them
money
and
clothes
and
tea
and
sugar
as
we
do
the
irish
for
they
were
evidently
respectable
people
and
proud
as
poor
so
i
took
my
bundle
of
odds
and
ends
and
mamma
added
some
nice
large
pieces
of
dresses
we
had
done
with
and
gave
a
fine
order
for
aprons
and
holders
and
balls
for
our
church
fair
it
would
have
done
your
hearts
good
girls
to
see
those
poor
old
faces
light
up
as
i
showed
my
scraps
and
asked
if
the
work
would
be
ready
by
christmas
grammer
fairly
swam
in
the
gay
colors
i
strewed
over
her
bed
and
enjoyed
them
like
a
child
while
almiry
tried
to
be
grim
but
had
to
give
it
up
as
she
began
at
once
to
cut
out
aprons
and
dropped
tears
all
over
the
muslin
when
her
back
was
turned
to
me
i
did
know
a
old
maid
could
be
so
ella
stopped
to
give
a
regretful
sigh
over
her
past
blindness
while
her
hearers
made
a
sympathetic
murmur
for
young
hearts
are
very
tender
and
take
an
innocent
interest
in
lovers
sorrows
no
matter
how
humble
well
that
was
the
beginning
of
it
i
got
so
absorbed
in
making
things
go
well
that
i
did
look
any
further
but
just
with
miss
miller
and
helped
run
that
little
shop
no
one
knew
me
in
that
street
so
i
slipped
in
and
out
and
did
what
i
liked
the
old
lady
and
i
got
to
be
great
friends
though
she
often
pecked
and
croaked
like
a
cross
raven
and
was
very
wearing
i
kept
her
busy
with
her
and
and
supplied
almiry
with
pretty
materials
for
the
various
things
i
found
she
could
make
you
would
believe
what
dainty
bows
those
long
fingers
could
tie
what
ravishing
doll
hats
she
would
make
out
of
a
scrap
of
silk
and
lace
or
the
ingenious
things
she
concocted
with
cones
and
shells
and
fans
and
baskets
i
love
such
work
and
used
to
go
and
help
her
often
for
i
wanted
her
window
and
shop
to
be
full
for
christmas
and
lure
in
plenty
of
customers
our
new
toys
and
the
little
cases
of
sewing
silk
sold
well
and
people
began
to
come
more
after
i
lent
almiry
some
money
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
better
goods
papa
enjoyed
my
business
venture
immensely
and
was
never
tired
of
joking
about
it
he
actually
went
and
bought
balls
for
four
small
black
boys
who
were
gluing
their
noses
to
the
window
one
day
spellbound
by
the
orange
red
and
blue
treasures
displayed
there
he
liked
my
partner
looks
though
he
teased
me
by
saying
that
we
better
add
lemonade
to
our
stock
as
poor
dear
almiry
acid
face
would
make
lemons
unnecessary
and
sugar
and
water
were
cheap
well
christmas
came
and
we
did
a
great
business
for
mamma
came
and
sent
others
and
our
fancy
things
were
as
pretty
and
cheaper
than
those
at
the
art
stores
so
they
went
well
and
the
millers
were
cheered
up
and
i
felt
encouraged
and
we
took
a
fresh
start
after
the
holidays
one
of
my
gifts
at
new
year
was
my
own
you
remember
the
thing
i
began
last
autumn
i
put
it
in
our
window
to
fill
up
and
mamma
bought
it
and
gave
it
to
me
full
of
elegant
gloves
with
a
sweet
note
and
papa
sent
a
check
to
warren
i
was
so
pleased
and
proud
i
could
hardly
help
telling
you
all
but
the
best
joke
was
the
day
you
girls
came
in
and
bought
our
goods
and
i
peeped
at
you
through
the
crack
of
the
door
being
in
the
back
room
dying
with
laughter
to
see
you
look
round
and
praise
our
assortment
of
useful
and
pretty
articles
that
all
very
well
and
we
can
bear
to
be
laughed
at
if
you
succeeded
miss
but
i
do
believe
you
did
for
no
millers
are
there
now
have
you
taken
a
palatial
store
on
boylston
street
for
this
year
intending
to
run
it
alone
we
all
patronize
it
and
your
name
will
look
well
on
a
sign
said
maggie
wondering
what
the
end
of
ella
experience
had
been
ah
i
still
have
the
best
of
it
for
my
romance
finished
up
delightfully
as
you
shall
hear
we
did
well
all
winter
and
no
wonder
what
was
needed
was
a
little
in
the
right
direction
and
i
could
give
it
so
my
millers
were
much
comforted
and
we
were
good
friends
but
in
march
grammer
died
suddenly
and
poor
almiry
mourned
as
if
she
had
been
the
sweetest
mother
in
the
world
the
old
lady
last
wishes
were
to
be
out
harnsome
in
a
cap
with
a
pale
blue
satin
ribbin
white
was
becomin
to
hev
at
least
three
carriages
to
the
funeral
and
be
sure
a
paper
with
her
death
in
it
was
sent
to
baxter
westminster
vermont
i
faithfully
obeyed
her
commands
put
on
the
ugly
cap
myself
gave
a
party
of
old
ladies
from
the
home
a
drive
in
the
hacks
and
carefully
directed
a
marked
paper
to
nathan
hoping
that
he
had
proved
and
true
i
did
expect
he
would
so
was
not
surprised
when
no
answer
came
but
i
was
rather
amazed
when
almiry
told
me
she
did
care
to
keep
on
with
the
store
now
she
was
free
she
wanted
to
visit
her
friends
a
spell
this
spring
and
in
the
fall
would
go
back
to
her
trade
in
some
milliner
store
i
was
sorry
for
i
really
enjoyed
my
partnership
it
seemed
a
little
bit
ungrateful
after
all
my
trouble
in
getting
her
customers
but
i
did
say
anything
and
we
sold
out
to
the
widow
bates
who
is
a
good
soul
with
six
children
and
will
profit
by
our
efforts
almiry
bid
me
with
all
the
grim
look
gone
out
of
her
face
many
thanks
and
a
hearty
promise
to
write
soon
that
was
in
april
a
week
ago
i
got
a
short
letter
saying
friend
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
am
married
to
baxter
and
shall
remain
here
he
was
away
when
the
paper
came
with
mother
death
but
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
wrote
i
could
make
up
my
mind
till
i
got
home
and
see
him
now
it
all
right
and
i
am
very
happy
many
thanks
for
all
you
done
for
me
and
mother
i
shall
never
forget
it
my
husband
sends
respects
and
i
remain
yours
gratefully
almira
m
baxter
that
splendid
you
did
well
and
next
winter
you
can
look
up
another
sour
spinster
and
cranky
old
lady
and
make
them
happy
said
anna
with
the
approving
smile
all
loved
to
receive
from
her
my
adventures
are
not
a
bit
romantic
or
even
interesting
and
yet
i
been
as
busy
as
a
bee
all
winter
and
enjoyed
my
work
very
much
began
elizabeth
as
the
president
gave
her
a
nod
the
plan
i
had
in
mind
was
to
go
and
carry
books
and
papers
to
the
people
in
hospitals
as
one
of
mamma
friends
has
done
for
years
i
went
once
to
the
city
hospital
with
her
and
it
was
very
interesting
but
i
did
dare
to
go
to
the
grown
people
all
alone
so
i
went
to
the
children
hospital
and
soon
loved
to
help
amuse
the
poor
little
dears
i
saved
all
the
and
papers
i
could
find
for
them
dressed
dolls
and
mended
toys
and
got
new
ones
and
made
bibs
and
and
felt
like
the
mother
of
a
large
family
i
had
my
pets
of
course
and
did
my
best
for
them
reading
and
singing
and
amusing
them
for
many
suffered
very
much
one
little
girl
was
so
dreadfully
burned
she
could
not
use
her
hands
and
would
lie
and
look
at
a
gay
dolly
tied
to
the
bedpost
by
the
hour
together
and
talk
to
it
and
love
it
and
died
with
it
on
her
pillow
when
i
lullaby
to
her
for
the
last
time
i
keep
it
among
my
treasures
for
i
learned
a
lesson
in
patience
from
little
norah
that
i
never
can
forget
then
jimmy
dolan
with
hip
disease
was
a
great
delight
to
me
for
he
was
as
gay
as
a
lark
in
spite
of
pain
and
a
real
little
hero
in
the
way
he
bore
the
hard
things
that
had
to
be
done
to
him
he
never
can
get
well
and
he
is
at
home
now
but
i
still
see
to
him
and
he
is
learning
to
make
toy
furniture
very
nicely
so
that
by
and
by
if
he
gets
able
to
work
at
all
he
may
be
able
to
learn
a
trade
or
some
easy
work
but
my
pet
of
pets
was
johnny
the
blind
boy
his
poor
eyes
had
to
be
taken
out
and
there
he
was
left
so
helpless
and
pathetic
all
his
life
before
him
and
no
one
to
help
him
for
his
people
were
poor
and
he
had
to
go
away
from
the
hospital
since
he
was
incurable
he
seemed
almost
given
to
me
for
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
was
singing
to
jimmy
when
the
door
opened
and
a
small
boy
came
fumbling
in
hear
a
pretty
voice
i
want
to
find
it
he
said
stopping
as
i
stopped
with
both
hands
out
as
if
begging
for
more
on
johnny
and
the
lady
will
sing
to
you
like
a
bobolink
called
jimmy
as
proud
as
barnum
showing
off
jumbo
the
poor
little
thing
came
and
stood
at
my
knee
without
stirring
while
i
sang
all
the
nursery
jingles
i
knew
then
he
put
such
a
thin
little
finger
on
my
lips
as
if
to
feel
where
the
music
came
from
and
said
smiling
all
over
his
white
face
please
more
lots
of
i
love
it
so
i
sang
away
till
i
was
as
hoarse
as
a
crow
and
johnny
drank
it
all
in
like
water
kept
time
with
his
head
stamped
when
i
gave
him
through
georgia
and
hurrahed
feebly
in
the
chorus
of
white
and
blue
it
was
lovely
to
see
how
he
enjoyed
it
and
i
was
so
glad
i
had
a
voice
to
comfort
those
poor
babies
with
he
cried
when
i
had
to
go
and
so
touched
my
heart
that
i
asked
all
about
him
and
resolved
to
get
him
into
the
blind
school
as
the
only
place
where
he
could
be
taught
and
made
i
thought
you
were
bound
there
the
day
i
met
you
lizzie
but
you
looked
as
solemn
as
if
all
your
friends
had
lost
their
sight
cried
marion
i
did
feel
solemn
for
if
johnny
could
not
go
there
he
would
be
badly
off
fortunately
he
was
ten
and
dear
russell
helped
me
and
those
good
people
took
him
in
though
they
were
crowded
can
not
turn
one
away
said
kind
parpatharges
so
there
my
boy
is
as
happy
as
a
king
with
his
little
mates
learning
all
sorts
of
useful
lessons
and
pretty
plays
he
models
nicely
in
clay
here
is
one
of
his
little
works
could
you
do
as
well
without
eyes
and
lizzie
proudly
produced
a
very
pear
with
a
long
straw
for
a
stem
i
do
expect
he
will
ever
be
a
sculptor
but
i
hope
he
will
do
something
with
music
he
loves
it
so
and
is
already
piping
away
on
a
fife
very
cleverly
whatever
his
gift
may
prove
if
he
lives
he
will
be
taught
to
be
a
useful
independent
man
not
a
helpless
burden
nor
an
unhappy
creature
sitting
alone
in
the
dark
i
feel
very
happy
about
my
lads
and
am
surprised
to
find
how
well
i
get
on
with
them
i
shall
look
up
some
more
next
year
for
i
really
think
i
have
quite
a
gift
that
way
though
you
would
expect
it
as
i
have
no
brothers
and
always
had
a
fancy
boys
were
little
the
girls
were
much
amused
at
lizzie
discovery
of
her
own
powers
for
she
was
a
stately
damsel
who
never
indulged
in
romps
but
lived
for
her
music
now
it
was
evident
that
she
had
found
the
key
to
unlock
childish
hearts
and
was
learning
to
use
it
quite
unconscious
that
the
sweet
voice
she
valued
so
highly
was
much
improved
by
the
tender
tones
singing
lullabies
gave
it
the
fat
pear
was
passed
round
like
refreshments
receiving
much
praise
and
no
harsh
criticism
and
when
it
was
safely
returned
to
its
proud
possessor
ida
began
her
tale
in
a
lively
tone
i
waited
for
my
chore
and
it
came
tumbling
down
our
basement
steps
one
rainy
day
in
the
shape
of
a
large
dilapidated
umbrella
with
a
pair
of
small
boots
below
it
a
mild
howl
made
me
run
to
open
the
door
for
i
was
at
lunch
in
the
all
alone
and
rather
blue
because
i
could
go
over
to
see
ella
a
very
small
girl
lay
with
her
head
in
a
puddle
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
boots
waving
in
the
air
and
the
umbrella
brooding
over
her
like
a
draggled
green
bird
you
hurt
child
said
i
i
thank
you
said
the
mite
quite
calmly
as
she
sat
up
and
settled
a
woman
shabby
black
hat
on
her
head
you
come
begging
i
asked
i
came
for
some
things
grover
got
for
us
she
told
me
to
i
do
beg
and
up
rose
the
sopping
thing
with
great
dignity
so
i
asked
her
to
sit
down
and
ran
up
to
call
grover
she
was
busy
with
grandpa
just
then
and
when
i
went
back
to
my
lunch
there
sat
my
lady
with
her
arms
folded
water
dripping
out
of
the
toes
of
her
old
boots
as
they
hung
down
from
the
high
chair
and
the
biggest
blue
eyes
i
ever
saw
fixed
upon
the
cake
and
oranges
on
the
table
i
gave
her
a
piece
and
she
sighed
with
rapture
but
only
picked
at
it
till
i
asked
if
she
did
like
it
yes
it
elegant
only
i
was
wishin
i
could
take
it
to
caddy
and
tot
if
you
did
mind
they
never
had
frostin
in
all
their
lives
and
i
did
once
of
course
i
put
up
a
little
basket
of
cake
and
oranges
and
figs
and
while
lotty
feasted
we
talked
i
found
that
their
mother
washed
dishes
all
day
in
a
restaurant
over
by
the
albany
station
leaving
the
three
children
alone
in
the
room
they
have
on
berry
street
think
of
that
poor
thing
going
off
before
light
these
winter
mornings
to
stand
over
horrid
dishes
all
day
long
and
those
three
scraps
of
children
alone
till
night
sometimes
they
had
a
fire
and
when
they
had
they
stayed
in
bed
broken
food
and
four
dollars
a
week
was
all
the
woman
got
and
on
that
they
tried
to
live
good
grover
happened
to
be
nursing
a
poor
soul
near
berry
street
last
summer
and
used
to
see
the
three
little
things
trailing
round
the
streets
with
no
one
to
look
after
them
lotty
is
nine
though
she
looks
about
six
but
is
as
old
as
most
girls
of
fourteen
and
takes
good
care
of
babies
as
she
calls
the
younger
ones
grover
went
to
see
them
and
though
a
creature
did
all
she
could
for
them
this
winter
she
has
plenty
of
time
to
sew
for
grandpapa
needs
little
done
for
him
except
at
night
and
morning
and
that
kind
woman
spent
her
own
money
and
got
warm
flannel
and
cotton
and
stuff
and
made
each
child
a
good
suit
lotty
had
come
for
hers
and
when
the
bundle
was
in
her
arms
she
hugged
it
close
and
put
up
her
little
face
to
kiss
grover
so
prettily
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
do
something
too
so
i
hunted
up
min
old
waterproof
and
rubbers
and
a
hood
and
sent
lotty
home
as
happy
as
a
queen
promising
to
go
and
see
her
i
did
go
and
there
was
my
work
all
ready
for
me
oh
girls
such
a
bare
cold
room
without
a
spark
of
fire
and
no
food
but
a
pan
of
bits
of
pie
and
bread
and
meat
not
fit
for
any
one
to
eat
and
in
the
bed
with
an
old
carpet
for
cover
lay
the
three
children
tot
and
caddy
cuddled
in
the
warmest
place
while
lotty
with
her
little
blue
hands
was
trying
to
patch
up
some
old
stockings
with
bits
of
cotton
i
did
know
how
to
begin
but
lotty
did
and
i
just
took
her
orders
for
that
wise
little
woman
told
me
where
to
buy
a
bushel
of
coal
and
some
kindlings
and
milk
and
meal
and
all
i
wanted
i
worked
like
a
beaver
for
an
hour
or
two
and
was
so
glad
i
been
to
a
for
i
could
make
a
fire
with
lotty
to
do
the
grubby
part
and
start
a
nice
soup
with
the
cold
meat
and
potatoes
and
an
onion
or
so
soon
the
room
was
warm
and
full
of
a
nice
smell
and
out
of
bed
tumbled
babies
to
dance
round
the
stove
and
sniff
at
the
soup
and
drink
milk
like
hungry
kittens
till
i
could
get
bread
and
butter
ready
it
was
great
fun
and
when
we
had
cleared
things
up
a
bit
and
put
food
for
supper
in
the
closet
and
told
lotty
to
warm
a
bowl
of
soup
for
her
mother
and
keep
the
fire
going
i
went
home
tired
and
dirty
but
very
glad
i
found
something
to
do
it
is
perfectly
amazing
how
little
poor
people
things
cost
and
yet
they
ca
get
the
small
amount
of
money
needed
without
working
themselves
to
death
why
all
i
bought
did
cost
more
than
i
often
spend
for
flowers
or
theatre
tickets
or
lunches
and
it
made
those
poor
babies
so
comfortable
i
could
have
cried
to
think
i
never
done
it
ida
paused
to
shake
her
head
remorsefully
then
went
on
with
her
story
sewing
busily
all
the
while
on
an
unbleached
cotton
which
looked
about
fit
for
a
large
doll
i
have
no
romantic
things
to
tell
for
poor
kennedy
was
a
shiftless
woman
who
could
only
round
as
grover
said
and
rub
along
with
help
from
any
one
who
would
lend
a
hand
she
had
lived
out
married
young
and
had
no
faculty
about
anything
so
when
her
husband
died
and
she
was
left
with
three
little
children
it
was
hard
to
get
on
with
no
trade
feeble
health
and
a
discouraged
mind
she
does
her
best
loves
the
girls
and
works
hard
at
the
only
thing
she
can
find
to
do
but
when
she
gives
out
they
will
all
have
to
part
she
to
a
hospital
and
the
babies
to
some
home
she
dreads
that
and
tugs
away
trying
to
keep
together
and
get
ahead
thanks
to
grover
who
is
very
sensible
and
knows
how
to
help
poor
people
we
have
made
things
comfortable
and
the
winter
has
gone
nicely
the
mother
has
got
work
nearer
home
lotty
and
caddy
go
to
school
and
tot
is
safe
and
warm
with
miss
parsons
to
look
after
her
miss
parsons
is
a
young
woman
who
was
freezing
and
starving
in
a
little
room
upstairs
too
proud
to
beg
and
too
shy
and
sick
to
get
much
work
i
found
her
warming
her
hands
one
day
in
kennedy
room
and
hanging
over
the
as
if
she
was
eating
the
smell
it
reminded
me
of
the
picture
in
punch
where
the
two
beggar
boys
look
in
at
a
kitchen
sniffing
at
the
nice
dinner
cooking
there
one
says
do
care
for
the
meat
bill
but
i
do
mind
if
i
takes
a
smell
at
the
when
it
dished
i
proposed
a
lunch
at
once
and
we
all
sat
down
and
ate
soup
out
of
yellow
bowls
with
pewter
spoons
with
such
a
relish
it
was
fun
to
see
i
had
on
my
old
rig
so
poor
parsons
thought
i
was
some
dressmaker
or
and
opened
her
heart
to
me
as
she
never
would
have
done
if
i
gone
and
demanded
her
confidence
and
patronized
her
as
some
people
do
when
they
want
to
help
i
promised
her
some
work
and
proposed
that
she
should
do
it
in
room
as
a
favor
mind
you
so
that
the
older
girls
could
go
to
school
and
tot
have
some
one
to
look
after
her
she
agreed
and
that
saved
her
fire
and
made
the
all
right
sarah
that
miss
tried
to
stiffen
up
when
she
learned
where
i
lived
but
she
wanted
the
work
and
soon
found
i
did
put
on
airs
but
lent
her
books
and
brought
her
and
tot
my
bouquets
and
favors
after
a
german
and
told
her
pleasant
things
as
she
sat
cooking
her
poor
chilblainy
feet
in
the
oven
as
if
she
never
could
get
thawed
out
this
summer
the
whole
batch
are
to
go
to
uncle
frank
farm
and
pick
berries
and
get
strong
he
hires
dozens
of
women
and
children
during
the
fruit
season
and
grover
said
it
was
just
what
they
all
needed
so
off
they
go
in
june
as
merry
as
grigs
and
i
shall
be
able
to
look
after
them
now
and
then
as
i
always
go
to
the
farm
in
july
that
all
not
a
bit
interesting
but
it
came
to
me
and
i
did
it
though
only
a
small
i
sure
the
helping
of
five
poor
souls
is
a
fine
work
and
you
may
well
be
proud
of
it
ida
now
i
know
why
you
would
go
to
matinees
with
me
and
buy
every
pretty
thing
we
saw
as
you
used
to
the
pocket
money
went
for
coal
and
food
and
your
fancy
work
was
little
clothes
for
these
live
dolls
of
yours
you
dear
thing
how
good
you
were
to
cook
and
grub
and
prick
your
fingers
rough
and
give
up
fun
for
this
kind
work
maggie
hearty
kiss
and
the
faces
of
her
friends
made
ida
feel
that
her
humble
task
had
its
worth
in
their
eyes
as
well
as
in
her
own
and
when
the
others
had
expressed
their
interest
in
her
work
all
composed
themselves
to
hear
what
marion
had
to
tell
i
have
been
taking
care
of
a
scarlet
runner
a
poor
old
neglected
thing
it
is
transplanted
now
and
doing
well
i
happy
to
what
do
you
mean
asked
ella
while
the
rest
looked
very
curious
marion
picked
up
a
dropped
stitch
in
the
large
blue
sock
she
was
knitting
and
continued
with
a
laugh
in
her
eyes
my
dears
that
is
what
we
call
the
soldiers
messenger
corps
with
their
red
caps
and
busy
legs
trotting
all
day
i
had
one
of
them
to
care
for
and
a
gorgeous
time
of
it
i
do
assure
you
but
before
i
exult
over
my
success
i
must
honestly
confess
my
failures
for
they
were
sad
ones
i
was
so
anxious
to
begin
my
work
at
once
that
i
did
go
out
and
collar
the
first
pauper
i
saw
it
was
an
old
man
who
sometimes
stands
at
the
corners
of
streets
to
sell
bunches
of
ugly
paper
flowers
you
seen
him
i
dare
say
and
his
magenta
daisies
and
yellow
peonies
well
he
was
rather
a
forlorn
object
with
his
poor
old
red
nose
and
bleary
eyes
and
white
hair
standing
at
the
windy
corners
silently
holding
out
those
horrid
flowers
i
bought
all
he
had
that
day
and
gave
them
to
some
colored
children
on
my
way
home
and
told
him
to
come
to
our
house
and
get
an
old
coat
mamma
was
waiting
to
get
rid
of
he
told
a
pitiful
story
of
himself
and
his
old
wife
who
made
the
paper
horrors
in
her
bed
and
how
they
needed
everything
but
did
wish
to
beg
i
was
much
touched
and
flew
home
to
look
up
the
coat
and
some
shoes
and
when
my
old
lear
came
creeping
in
the
back
way
i
ordered
cook
to
give
him
a
warm
dinner
and
something
nice
for
the
old
woman
i
was
called
upstairs
while
he
was
mumbling
his
food
and
blessing
me
in
the
most
lovely
manner
and
he
went
away
much
comforted
i
flattered
myself
but
an
hour
later
up
came
the
cook
in
a
great
panic
to
report
that
my
venerable
and
pious
beggar
had
carried
off
several
of
papa
shirts
and
pairs
of
socks
out
of
the
in
the
laundry
and
the
nice
warm
hood
we
keep
for
the
girl
to
hang
out
clothes
in
i
was
very
angry
and
taking
harry
with
me
went
at
once
to
the
address
the
old
rascal
gave
me
a
dirty
court
out
of
hanover
street
no
such
person
had
ever
lived
there
and
my
saint
was
a
humbug
harry
laughed
at
me
and
mamma
forbade
me
to
bring
any
more
thieves
to
the
house
and
the
girls
scolded
awfully
well
i
recovered
from
the
shock
and
nothing
daunted
went
off
to
the
little
irishwoman
who
sells
apples
on
the
common
not
the
fat
tosey
one
with
the
stall
near
west
street
but
the
one
who
sits
by
the
path
nodding
over
an
old
basket
with
six
apples
and
four
sticks
of
candy
in
it
no
one
ever
seems
to
buy
anything
but
she
sits
there
and
trusts
to
kind
souls
dropping
a
dime
now
and
then
she
looks
so
feeble
and
forlorn
the
cold
cold
ground
she
told
me
another
sad
tale
of
being
all
alone
and
unable
to
work
and
wake
as
without
a
av
flesh
upon
me
bones
and
for
the
love
of
heaven
gim
me
a
thrifle
to
kape
the
breath
av
loife
in
a
poor
soul
with
a
bitter
hard
winter
over
me
and
niver
a
chick
or
child
to
do
a
hand
turn
i
had
much
faith
in
her
remembering
my
other
humbug
but
i
did
pity
the
old
mummy
so
i
got
some
tea
and
sugar
and
a
shawl
and
used
to
give
her
my
odd
pennies
as
i
passed
i
never
told
at
home
they
made
such
fun
of
my
efforts
to
be
charitable
i
thought
i
really
was
getting
on
pretty
well
after
a
time
as
my
old
biddy
seemed
quite
cheered
up
and
i
was
planning
to
give
her
some
coal
when
she
disappeared
all
of
a
sudden
i
feared
she
was
ill
and
asked
maloney
the
fat
woman
about
her
love
ye
miss
dear
it
tuk
up
and
sint
to
the
island
for
tree
months
she
is
for
a
drunken
ould
crayther
is
biddy
ryan
and
niver
a
cint
but
goes
for
whiskey
more
shame
to
her
wid
a
fine
bye
av
her
own
ready
to
kape
her
daycint
then
i
was
discouraged
and
went
home
to
fold
my
hands
and
see
what
fate
would
send
me
my
own
efforts
being
such
poor
thing
it
was
hard
luck
said
elizabeth
as
they
sobered
down
after
the
gale
of
merriment
caused
by
marion
mishaps
and
her
clever
imitation
of
the
brogue
now
tell
of
your
success
and
the
scarlet
runner
added
maggie
ah
that
was
sent
and
so
i
prospered
i
must
begin
ever
so
far
back
in
war
times
or
i
ca
introduce
my
hero
properly
you
know
papa
was
in
the
army
and
fought
all
through
the
war
till
gettysburg
where
he
was
wounded
he
was
engaged
just
before
he
went
so
when
his
father
hurried
to
him
after
that
awful
battle
mamma
went
also
and
helped
nurse
him
till
he
could
come
home
he
would
go
to
an
officer
hospital
but
kept
with
his
men
in
a
poor
sort
of
place
for
many
of
his
boys
were
hit
and
he
leave
them
sergeant
joe
collins
was
one
of
the
bravest
and
lost
his
right
arm
saving
the
flag
in
one
of
the
hottest
struggles
of
that
great
fight
he
had
been
a
maine
lumberman
and
was
over
six
feet
tall
but
as
gentle
as
a
child
and
as
jolly
as
a
boy
and
very
fond
of
his
colonel
papa
left
first
but
made
joe
promise
to
let
him
know
how
he
got
on
and
joe
did
so
till
he
too
went
home
then
papa
lost
sight
of
him
and
in
the
excitement
of
his
own
illness
and
the
end
of
the
war
and
being
married
joe
collins
was
forgotten
till
we
children
came
along
and
used
to
love
to
hear
the
story
of
papa
battles
and
how
the
brave
sergeant
caught
the
flag
when
the
bearer
was
shot
and
held
it
in
the
rush
till
one
arm
was
blown
off
and
the
other
wounded
we
have
fighting
blood
in
us
you
know
so
we
were
never
tired
of
that
story
though
years
or
more
make
it
all
as
far
away
to
us
as
the
old
revolution
where
our
ancestor
was
killed
at
our
bunker
hill
last
december
just
after
my
sad
disappointments
papa
came
home
to
dinner
one
day
exclaiming
in
great
glee
found
old
joe
a
messenger
came
with
a
letter
to
me
and
when
i
looked
up
to
give
my
answer
there
stood
a
tall
grizzled
fellow
as
straight
as
a
ramrod
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
with
his
hand
to
his
temple
saluting
me
in
regular
style
do
you
remember
joe
collins
colonel
awful
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
he
and
then
it
all
came
back
and
we
had
a
good
talk
and
i
found
out
that
the
poor
old
boy
was
down
on
his
luck
and
almost
friendless
but
as
proud
and
independent
as
ever
and
bound
to
take
care
of
himself
while
he
had
a
leg
to
stand
on
i
got
his
address
and
mean
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
for
he
looks
feeble
and
ca
make
much
i
sure
we
were
all
very
glad
and
joe
came
to
see
us
and
papa
sent
him
on
endless
errands
and
helped
him
in
that
way
till
he
went
to
new
york
then
in
the
fun
and
flurry
of
the
holidays
we
forgot
all
about
joe
till
papa
came
home
and
missed
him
from
his
post
i
said
i
go
and
find
him
so
harry
and
i
rummaged
about
till
we
did
find
him
in
a
little
house
at
the
north
end
laid
up
with
rheumatic
fever
in
a
stuffy
back
room
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
but
the
washerwoman
with
whom
he
boarded
i
was
so
sorry
we
had
forgotten
him
but
he
never
complained
only
said
with
his
cheerful
grin
i
kinder
mistrusted
the
colonel
was
away
but
i
was
goin
to
pester
him
he
tried
to
be
jolly
though
in
dreadful
pain
called
harry
and
was
so
grateful
for
all
we
brought
him
though
he
did
want
oranges
and
tea
and
made
us
shout
when
i
said
like
a
goose
thinking
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
i
bathe
your
brow
you
are
so
feverish
thanky
miss
it
was
swabbed
pretty
stiddy
to
the
horsepittle
and
i
reckon
a
trifle
of
tobaccer
would
do
more
good
and
be
a
sight
more
relishin
ef
you
excuse
my
mentionin
it
harry
rushed
off
and
got
a
great
lump
and
a
pipe
and
joe
lay
blissfully
puffing
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
when
we
left
him
promising
to
come
again
we
did
go
nearly
every
day
and
had
lovely
times
for
joe
told
us
his
adventures
and
we
got
so
interested
in
the
war
that
i
began
to
read
up
evenings
and
papa
was
pleased
and
fought
all
his
battles
over
again
for
us
and
harry
and
i
were
great
friends
reading
together
and
papa
was
charmed
to
see
the
old
spirit
in
us
as
we
got
excited
and
discussed
all
our
wars
in
a
fever
of
patriotism
that
made
mamma
laugh
joe
said
i
at
the
word
battle
like
a
at
the
smell
of
powder
and
ought
to
have
been
a
drummer
the
sound
of
martial
music
made
me
so
it
was
all
new
and
charming
to
us
young
ones
but
poor
old
joe
had
a
hard
time
and
was
very
ill
exposure
and
fatigue
and
scanty
food
and
loneliness
and
his
wounds
were
too
much
for
him
and
it
was
plain
his
working
days
were
over
he
hated
the
thought
of
the
at
home
which
was
all
his
own
town
could
offer
him
and
he
had
no
friends
to
live
with
and
he
could
not
get
a
pension
something
being
wrong
about
his
papers
so
he
would
have
been
badly
off
but
for
the
soldiers
home
at
chelsea
as
soon
as
he
was
able
papa
got
him
in
there
and
he
was
glad
to
go
for
that
seemed
the
proper
place
and
a
charity
the
proudest
man
might
accept
after
risking
his
life
for
his
country
there
is
where
i
used
to
be
going
when
you
saw
me
and
i
was
so
afraid
you
smell
the
cigars
in
my
basket
the
dear
old
boys
always
want
them
and
papa
says
they
must
have
them
though
it
is
half
so
romantic
as
flowers
and
jelly
and
wine
and
the
dainty
messes
we
women
always
want
to
carry
i
learned
about
different
kinds
of
tobacco
and
cigars
and
you
laugh
to
see
me
deal
out
my
gifts
which
are
received
as
gratefully
as
the
victoria
cross
when
the
queen
decorates
her
brave
men
i
quite
a
great
gun
over
there
and
the
boys
salute
when
i
come
tell
me
their
woes
and
think
that
papa
and
i
can
run
the
whole
concern
i
like
it
immensely
and
am
as
proud
and
fond
of
my
dear
old
wrecks
as
if
i
been
a
rigoletto
and
ridden
on
a
cannon
from
my
babyhood
that
my
story
but
i
begin
to
tell
how
interesting
it
all
is
nor
how
glad
i
am
that
it
led
me
to
look
into
the
history
of
american
wars
in
which
brave
men
of
our
name
did
their
parts
so
a
hearty
round
of
applause
greeted
marion
tale
for
her
glowing
face
and
excited
voice
stirred
the
patriotic
spirit
of
the
boston
girls
and
made
them
beam
approvingly
upon
her
now
maggie
dear
last
but
not
least
i
sure
said
anna
with
an
encouraging
glance
for
she
had
discovered
the
secret
of
this
friend
and
loved
her
more
than
ever
for
it
maggie
blushed
and
hesitated
as
she
put
down
the
delicate
muslin
she
was
hemming
with
such
care
then
looking
about
her
with
a
face
in
which
both
humility
and
pride
contended
she
said
with
an
effort
after
the
other
lively
experiences
mine
will
sound
very
flat
in
fact
i
have
no
story
to
tell
for
my
charity
began
at
home
and
stopped
tell
it
dear
i
know
it
is
interesting
and
will
do
us
all
good
said
anna
quickly
and
thus
supported
maggie
went
on
i
planned
great
things
and
talked
about
what
i
meant
to
do
till
papa
said
one
day
when
things
were
in
a
mess
as
they
often
are
at
our
house
the
little
girls
who
want
to
help
the
world
along
would
remember
that
charity
begins
at
home
they
would
soon
find
enough
to
do
i
was
rather
taken
aback
and
said
no
more
but
after
papa
had
gone
to
the
office
i
began
to
think
and
looked
round
to
see
what
there
was
to
be
done
at
that
particular
moment
i
found
enough
for
that
day
and
took
hold
at
once
for
poor
mamma
had
one
of
her
bad
headaches
the
children
could
not
go
out
because
it
rained
and
so
were
howling
in
the
nursery
cook
was
on
a
rampage
and
maria
had
the
toothache
well
i
began
by
making
mamma
lie
down
for
a
good
long
sleep
i
kept
the
children
quiet
by
giving
them
my
ribbon
box
and
jewelry
to
dress
up
with
put
a
poultice
on
maria
face
and
offered
to
wash
the
glass
and
silver
for
her
to
appease
cook
who
was
as
cross
as
two
sticks
over
extra
work
it
much
fun
as
you
may
imagine
but
i
got
through
the
afternoon
and
kept
the
house
still
and
at
dusk
crept
into
mamma
room
and
softly
built
up
the
fire
so
it
should
be
cheery
when
she
waked
then
i
went
trembling
to
the
kitchen
for
some
tea
and
there
found
three
girls
calling
and
high
jinks
going
on
for
one
whisked
a
plate
of
cake
into
the
table
drawer
another
put
a
cup
under
her
shawl
and
cook
hid
the
teapot
as
i
stirred
round
in
the
china
closet
before
opening
the
slide
through
a
crack
of
which
i
seen
heard
and
smelt
party
as
the
children
call
it
i
was
angry
enough
to
scold
the
whole
set
but
i
wisely
held
my
tongue
shut
my
eyes
and
politely
asked
for
some
hot
water
nodded
to
the
guests
and
told
cook
maria
was
better
and
would
do
her
work
if
she
wanted
to
go
out
so
peace
reigned
and
as
i
settled
the
tray
i
heard
cook
say
in
her
balmiest
tone
for
i
suspect
the
cake
and
tea
lay
heavy
on
her
conscience
mistress
is
very
poorly
and
miss
takes
nice
care
of
her
the
dear
all
blarney
but
it
pleased
me
and
made
me
remember
how
feeble
poor
mamma
was
and
how
little
i
really
did
so
i
wept
a
repentant
weep
as
i
toiled
upstairs
with
my
tea
and
toast
and
found
mamma
all
ready
for
them
and
so
pleased
to
find
things
going
well
i
saw
by
that
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
her
if
i
did
it
oftener
as
i
ought
and
as
i
resolved
that
i
would
i
did
say
anything
but
i
kept
on
doing
whatever
came
along
and
before
i
knew
it
ever
so
many
duties
slipped
out
of
mamma
hands
into
mine
and
seemed
to
belong
to
me
i
do
mean
that
i
liked
them
and
did
grumble
to
myself
i
did
and
felt
regularly
crushed
and
injured
sometimes
when
i
wanted
to
go
and
have
my
own
fun
duty
is
right
but
it
is
easy
and
the
only
comfort
about
it
is
a
sort
of
quiet
feeling
you
get
after
a
while
and
a
strong
feeling
as
if
you
found
something
to
hold
on
to
and
keep
you
steady
i
ca
express
it
but
you
know
and
maggie
looked
wistfully
at
the
other
faces
some
of
which
answered
her
with
a
quick
flash
of
sympathy
and
some
only
wore
a
puzzled
yet
respectful
expression
as
if
they
felt
they
ought
to
know
but
did
not
i
need
not
tire
you
with
all
my
humdrum
doings
continued
maggie
i
made
no
plans
but
just
said
each
day
take
what
comes
and
try
to
be
cheerful
and
contented
so
i
looked
after
the
children
and
that
left
maria
more
time
to
sew
and
help
round
i
did
errands
and
went
to
market
and
saw
that
papa
had
his
meals
comfortably
when
mamma
was
not
able
to
come
down
i
made
calls
for
her
and
received
visitors
and
soon
went
on
as
if
i
were
the
lady
of
the
house
not
chit
of
a
girl
as
cousin
tom
used
to
call
me
the
best
of
all
were
the
cosey
talks
we
had
in
the
twilight
mamma
and
i
when
she
was
rested
and
all
the
day
worry
was
over
and
we
were
waiting
for
papa
now
when
he
came
i
did
have
to
go
away
for
they
wanted
to
ask
and
tell
me
things
and
consult
about
affairs
and
make
me
feel
that
i
was
really
the
eldest
daughter
oh
it
was
just
lovely
to
sit
between
them
and
know
that
they
needed
me
and
loved
to
have
me
with
them
that
made
up
for
the
hard
and
disagreeable
things
and
not
long
ago
i
got
my
reward
mamma
is
better
and
i
was
rejoicing
over
it
when
she
said
yes
i
really
am
mending
now
and
hope
soon
to
be
able
to
relieve
my
good
girl
but
i
want
to
tell
you
dear
that
when
i
was
most
discouraged
my
greatest
comfort
was
that
if
i
had
to
leave
my
poor
babies
they
would
find
such
a
faithful
little
mother
in
you
i
was
so
pleased
i
wanted
to
cry
for
the
children
do
love
me
and
run
to
me
for
everything
now
and
think
the
world
of
sister
and
they
did
use
to
care
much
for
me
but
that
was
all
i
ought
not
to
tell
these
things
perhaps
but
i
so
proud
of
them
i
help
it
when
i
asked
papa
privately
if
mamma
was
really
better
and
in
no
danger
of
falling
ill
again
he
said
with
his
arms
round
me
and
such
a
tender
kiss
danger
now
for
this
brave
little
girl
put
her
shoulder
to
the
wheel
so
splendidly
that
the
dear
woman
got
the
relief
from
care
she
needed
just
at
the
right
time
and
now
she
really
rests
sure
that
we
are
not
neglected
you
could
have
devoted
yourself
to
a
better
charity
or
done
it
more
sweetly
my
darling
god
bless
you
here
maggie
voice
gave
out
and
she
hid
her
face
with
a
happy
sob
that
finished
her
story
eloquently
marion
flew
to
wipe
her
tears
away
with
the
blue
sock
and
the
others
gave
a
sympathetic
murmur
looking
much
touched
forgotten
duties
of
their
own
rose
before
them
and
sudden
resolutions
were
made
to
attend
to
them
at
once
seeing
how
great
maggie
reward
had
been
i
did
mean
to
be
silly
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
been
idle
all
winter
and
that
though
i
have
much
to
tell
quite
satisfied
with
my
chore
she
said
looking
up
with
smiles
shining
through
the
tears
till
her
face
resembled
a
rose
in
a
many
daughters
have
done
well
but
thou
excellest
them
all
answered
anna
with
a
kiss
that
completed
her
satisfaction
now
as
it
is
after
our
usual
time
and
we
must
break
up
continued
the
president
producing
a
basket
of
flowers
from
its
i
will
merely
say
that
i
think
we
have
all
learned
a
good
deal
and
will
be
able
to
work
better
next
winter
for
i
am
sure
we
shall
want
to
try
again
it
adds
so
much
sweetness
to
our
own
lives
to
put
even
a
little
comfort
into
the
hard
lives
of
the
poor
as
a
farewell
token
i
sent
for
some
real
plymouth
mayflowers
and
here
they
are
a
posy
apiece
with
my
love
and
many
thanks
for
your
help
in
carrying
out
my
plan
so
so
the
nosegays
were
bestowed
the
last
lively
chat
enjoyed
new
plans
suggested
and
goodbyes
said
then
the
club
separated
each
member
going
gayly
away
with
the
rosy
flowers
on
her
bosom
and
in
it
a
clearer
knowledge
of
the
sad
side
of
life
a
fresh
desire
to
see
and
help
still
more
and
a
sweet
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
each
had
done
what
she
could
an
ivy
spray
and
ladies
slippers
it
ca
be
done
so
i
may
as
well
give
it
i
up
and
get
a
new
pair
i
long
for
them
but
i
afraid
my
nice
little
plan
for
laura
will
be
spoilt
said
jessie
delano
to
herself
as
she
shook
her
head
over
a
pair
of
small
dilapidated
slippers
almost
past
mending
while
she
vainly
pricked
her
fingers
over
them
for
the
last
time
her
mind
was
full
of
girlish
hopes
and
fears
as
well
as
of
anxieties
far
too
serious
for
a
creature
of
sixteen
a
year
ago
the
sisters
had
been
the
petted
daughters
of
a
rich
man
but
death
and
misfortune
came
suddenly
and
now
they
were
left
to
face
poverty
alone
they
had
few
relations
and
had
offended
the
rich
uncle
who
offered
jessie
a
home
because
she
refused
to
be
separated
from
her
sister
poor
laura
was
an
invalid
and
no
one
wanted
her
but
jessie
would
not
leave
her
so
they
clung
together
and
lived
on
in
the
humble
rooms
where
their
father
died
trying
to
earn
their
bread
by
the
only
accomplishments
they
possessed
laura
painted
well
and
after
many
disappointments
was
beginning
to
find
a
sale
for
her
dainty
designs
and
delicate
flowers
jessie
had
a
natural
gift
for
dancing
and
her
former
teacher
a
frenchwoman
offered
her
favorite
pupil
the
post
of
assistant
teacher
in
her
classes
for
children
it
cost
the
girl
a
struggle
to
accept
a
place
of
this
sort
and
be
a
humble
teacher
patiently
twirling
stupid
little
boys
and
girls
round
and
round
over
the
smooth
floor
where
she
used
to
dance
so
happily
when
she
was
the
pride
of
the
class
and
the
queen
of
the
closing
balls
but
for
laura
sake
she
gratefully
accepted
the
offer
glad
to
add
her
mite
to
their
small
store
and
to
feel
that
she
could
help
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
they
had
seemed
to
hear
the
howl
of
this
dreaded
phantom
more
than
once
during
that
year
and
looked
forward
to
the
long
hard
winter
with
an
anxiety
which
neither
would
confess
to
the
other
laura
feared
to
fall
ill
if
she
worked
too
hard
and
then
what
would
become
of
this
pretty
young
sister
who
loved
her
so
tenderly
and
would
not
be
tempted
to
leave
her
and
jessie
could
do
very
little
except
rebel
against
their
hard
fate
and
make
impracticable
plans
but
each
worked
bravely
talked
cheerfully
and
waited
hopefully
for
some
good
fortune
to
befall
them
while
doubt
and
pain
and
poverty
and
care
made
the
young
hearts
so
heavy
that
the
poor
girls
often
fell
asleep
on
pillows
wet
with
secret
tears
the
smaller
trials
of
life
beset
jessie
at
this
particular
moment
and
her
bright
wits
were
trying
to
solve
the
problem
how
to
spend
her
treasured
five
dollars
on
slippers
for
herself
and
paints
for
laura
both
were
much
needed
and
she
had
gone
in
shabby
shoes
to
save
up
money
for
the
little
surprise
on
which
she
had
set
her
heart
but
now
dismay
fell
upon
her
when
the
holes
refused
to
be
cobbled
and
the
largest
of
bows
would
not
hide
the
toes
in
spite
of
ink
and
blacking
lavishly
applied
these
are
the
last
of
my
dear
french
slippers
and
i
ca
afford
any
more
i
hate
cheap
things
but
i
shall
have
to
get
them
for
my
boots
are
shabby
and
every
one
has
to
look
at
my
feet
when
i
lead
oh
dear
what
a
horrid
thing
it
is
to
be
poor
and
jessie
surveyed
the
shabby
little
shoes
affectionately
as
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
for
the
road
looked
very
rough
and
steep
now
when
she
remembered
how
she
used
to
dance
through
life
as
happy
as
a
butterfly
in
a
garden
full
of
sunshine
and
flowers
now
jess
no
nonsense
no
red
eyes
to
tell
tales
go
and
do
your
errands
and
come
in
as
gay
as
a
lark
or
laura
will
be
and
springing
up
the
girl
began
to
sing
instead
of
sob
as
she
stirred
about
her
dismal
little
room
cleaning
her
old
gloves
mending
her
one
white
dress
and
wishing
with
a
sigh
of
intense
longing
that
she
could
afford
some
flowers
to
wear
every
ornament
having
been
sold
long
ago
then
with
a
kiss
and
a
smile
to
her
patient
sister
she
hurried
away
to
get
the
necessary
slippers
and
the
paints
which
laura
would
not
ask
for
though
her
work
waited
for
want
of
them
having
been
reared
in
luxury
poor
little
jessie
tastes
were
all
of
the
daintiest
sort
and
her
hardest
trial
after
laura
feeble
health
was
the
daily
sacrifice
of
the
many
comforts
and
elegances
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
faded
gowns
cleaned
gloves
and
mended
boots
cost
her
many
a
pang
and
the
constant
temptation
of
seeing
pretty
useful
and
unattainable
things
was
a
very
hard
one
laura
rarely
went
out
and
so
was
spared
this
cross
then
she
was
three
years
older
had
always
been
delicate
and
lived
much
in
a
happy
world
of
her
own
so
jessie
bore
her
trials
silently
but
sometimes
felt
very
covetous
and
resentful
to
see
so
much
pleasure
money
and
beauty
in
the
world
and
yet
have
so
little
of
it
fall
to
her
lot
i
feel
as
if
i
could
pick
a
pocket
and
not
mind
a
bit
if
it
were
a
rich
person
it
a
shame
when
papa
was
always
so
generous
that
no
one
remembers
us
if
ever
i
rich
again
just
hunt
up
all
the
poor
girls
i
can
find
and
give
them
nice
shoes
if
nothing
else
she
thought
as
she
went
along
the
crowded
streets
pausing
involuntarily
at
the
shop
windows
to
look
with
longing
eyes
at
the
treasures
within
resisting
the
allurements
of
french
slippers
with
bows
and
buckles
she
wisely
bought
a
plain
serviceable
pair
and
trudged
away
finding
balm
for
her
wounds
in
the
fact
that
they
were
very
cheap
more
balm
came
when
she
met
a
young
friend
who
joined
her
as
she
stood
wistfully
eying
the
piles
of
grapes
in
a
window
and
longing
to
buy
some
for
laura
this
schoolmate
read
the
wish
before
jessie
saw
her
and
gratified
it
so
adroitly
that
the
girl
could
accept
the
pretty
basketful
sent
to
her
sister
without
feeling
like
a
spendthrift
or
a
beggar
it
comforted
her
very
much
and
the
world
began
to
look
brighter
after
that
little
touch
of
kindness
as
it
always
does
when
genuine
sympathy
makes
sunshine
in
shady
places
at
the
art
store
she
was
told
that
more
of
laura
were
in
demand
and
her
face
was
so
full
of
innocent
delight
and
gratitude
it
quite
touched
the
old
man
who
sold
her
the
paints
and
gave
her
more
than
her
money
worth
remembering
his
own
hard
times
and
pitying
the
pretty
young
girl
whose
father
he
had
known
so
jessie
did
not
have
to
pretend
very
hard
at
being
as
gay
as
a
lark
when
she
got
home
and
showed
her
treasures
laura
was
so
happy
over
the
unexpected
gifts
that
the
dinner
of
bread
and
milk
and
grapes
was
quite
a
picnic
and
jessie
found
a
smile
on
her
face
when
she
went
to
dress
for
her
party
it
was
only
a
child
party
at
the
house
of
one
of
pupils
and
jessie
was
merely
invited
to
help
the
little
people
through
their
dancing
she
did
not
like
to
go
in
this
way
as
she
was
sure
to
meet
familiar
faces
there
full
of
the
pity
curiosity
or
indifference
so
hard
for
a
girl
to
bear
but
mademoiselle
asked
it
as
a
favor
and
jessie
was
grateful
so
she
went
expecting
no
pleasure
and
certain
of
much
weariness
if
not
annoyance
when
she
was
ready
and
it
did
not
take
long
to
slip
on
the
white
woollen
dress
brush
out
the
curly
dark
hair
and
fold
up
slippers
and
gloves
she
stood
before
her
glass
looking
at
herself
quite
conscious
that
she
was
very
pretty
with
her
large
eyes
blooming
cheeks
and
the
lofty
little
air
which
nothing
could
change
she
was
also
painfully
conscious
that
her
dress
was
neither
fresh
nor
becoming
without
a
bit
of
ribbon
or
a
knot
of
flowers
to
give
it
the
touch
of
color
it
needed
she
had
an
artistic
eye
and
used
to
delight
in
ordering
charming
costumes
for
herself
in
the
happy
days
when
all
her
wishes
were
granted
as
if
fairies
still
lived
she
tossed
over
her
very
small
store
of
ribbons
in
vain
everything
had
been
worn
till
neither
beauty
nor
freshness
remained
oh
dear
where
can
i
find
something
to
make
me
look
less
like
a
nun
and
a
very
shabby
one
too
she
said
longing
for
the
pink
corals
she
sold
to
pay
laura
doctor
bill
the
sound
of
a
soft
tap
tap
tap
startled
her
and
she
ran
to
open
the
door
no
one
was
there
but
laura
fast
asleep
on
the
sofa
tap
tap
tap
went
the
invisible
hand
and
as
the
sound
seemed
to
come
from
the
window
jessie
glanced
that
way
thinking
her
tame
dove
had
come
to
be
fed
neither
hungry
dove
nor
bold
sparrow
appeared
only
a
spray
of
japanese
ivy
waving
in
the
wind
a
very
pretty
spray
it
was
covered
with
tiny
crimson
leaves
and
it
tapped
impatiently
as
if
it
answered
her
question
by
saying
here
is
a
garland
for
you
come
and
take
jessie
quick
eye
was
caught
at
once
by
the
fine
color
and
running
to
the
window
she
looked
out
as
eagerly
as
if
a
new
idea
had
come
into
her
head
it
was
a
dull
november
day
and
the
prospect
of
sheds
and
old
brooms
was
a
gloomy
one
but
the
whole
back
of
the
house
glowed
with
the
red
tendrils
of
the
hardy
vine
that
clung
to
and
covered
the
dingy
bricks
with
a
royal
mantle
as
if
eager
to
cheer
the
eyes
and
hearts
of
all
who
looked
it
preached
a
little
sermon
of
courage
aspiration
and
content
to
those
who
had
the
skill
to
read
it
and
bade
them
see
how
springing
from
the
scanty
soil
of
that
back
yard
full
of
the
commonest
objects
the
humblest
work
it
set
its
little
creepers
in
the
crannies
of
the
stone
and
struggled
up
to
find
the
sun
and
air
till
it
grew
strong
and
beautiful
making
the
blank
wall
green
in
summer
glorious
in
autumn
and
a
refuge
in
winter
when
it
welcomed
the
sparrows
to
the
shelter
of
its
branches
where
the
sun
lay
warmest
jessie
loved
this
beautiful
neighbor
and
had
enjoyed
it
all
that
summer
the
first
she
ever
spent
in
the
hot
city
she
felt
the
grace
its
greenness
gave
to
all
it
touched
and
half
unconsciously
imitated
it
in
trying
to
be
brave
and
bright
as
she
also
climbed
up
from
the
dismal
place
where
she
seemed
shut
away
from
everything
lovely
till
she
was
beginning
to
discover
that
the
blue
sky
was
over
all
the
sun
still
shone
for
her
and
heaven
fresh
air
kissed
her
cheeks
as
kindly
as
ever
many
a
night
she
had
leaned
from
the
high
window
when
laura
was
asleep
dreaming
innocent
dreams
living
over
her
short
past
or
trying
to
look
into
the
future
bravely
and
trustfully
the
little
vine
had
felt
warmer
drops
than
rain
or
dew
fall
on
it
when
things
went
badly
had
heard
whispered
prayers
when
the
lonely
child
asked
the
father
of
the
fatherless
for
help
and
comfort
had
peeped
in
to
see
her
sleeping
peacefully
when
the
hard
hour
was
over
and
been
the
first
to
greet
her
with
a
tap
on
the
as
she
woke
full
of
new
hope
in
the
morning
it
seemed
to
know
all
her
moods
and
troubles
to
be
her
friend
and
confidante
and
now
came
with
help
like
a
fairy
godmother
when
our
cinderella
wanted
to
be
fine
for
the
little
ball
just
the
thing
why
did
i
think
of
it
so
bright
and
delicate
and
becoming
it
will
last
better
than
flowers
and
no
one
can
think
i
extravagant
since
it
costs
as
she
spoke
jessie
was
gathering
long
sprays
of
the
rosy
vine
with
its
glossy
leaves
so
beautifully
shaded
that
it
was
evident
jack
frost
had
done
his
best
for
it
going
to
her
glass
she
fastened
a
wreath
of
the
smallest
leaves
about
her
head
set
a
cluster
of
larger
ones
in
her
bosom
and
then
surveyed
herself
with
girlish
pleasure
as
well
she
might
for
the
effect
of
the
simple
decoration
was
charming
quite
satisfied
now
she
tied
on
her
cloud
and
slipped
away
without
waking
laura
little
dreaming
what
good
fortune
the
ivy
spray
was
to
bring
them
both
she
found
the
children
prancing
with
impatience
to
begin
their
ballet
much
excited
by
the
music
gaslight
and
gay
dresses
which
made
it
seem
like
a
truly
all
welcomed
jessie
and
she
soon
forgot
the
cheap
slippers
mended
gloves
and
old
dress
as
she
gayly
led
her
troop
through
the
pretty
dance
with
so
much
grace
and
skill
that
the
admiring
mammas
who
lined
the
walls
declared
it
was
the
sweetest
thing
they
ever
saw
who
is
that
little
person
asked
one
of
the
few
gentlemen
who
hovered
about
the
doorways
his
hostess
told
jessie
story
in
a
few
words
and
was
surprised
to
hear
him
say
in
a
satisfied
tone
i
glad
she
is
poor
i
want
her
head
and
now
there
is
some
chance
of
getting
my
dear
vane
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
lady
laughing
i
came
to
study
young
faces
i
want
one
for
a
picture
and
that
little
girl
with
the
red
leaves
is
charming
please
present
no
use
you
may
ask
for
her
hand
if
you
like
but
not
for
her
head
she
is
very
proud
and
never
would
consent
to
sit
as
a
model
i
i
think
i
can
manage
it
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
a
very
well
the
children
are
just
going
down
to
supper
and
miss
delano
will
rest
you
can
make
your
bold
proposal
now
if
you
a
moment
later
as
she
stood
watching
the
little
ones
troop
away
jessie
found
herself
bowing
to
the
tall
gentleman
who
begged
to
know
what
he
could
bring
her
with
as
much
interest
as
if
she
had
been
the
finest
lady
in
the
room
of
course
she
chose
and
slipped
into
a
corner
to
rest
her
tired
feet
preferring
the
deserted
parlor
to
the
noisy
not
being
quite
sure
where
she
belonged
now
vane
brought
her
a
salver
full
of
the
dainties
girls
best
love
and
drawing
up
a
table
began
to
eat
and
talk
in
such
a
simple
comfortable
way
that
jessie
could
not
feel
shy
but
was
soon
quite
at
her
ease
she
knew
that
he
was
a
famous
artist
and
longed
to
tell
him
about
poor
laura
who
admired
his
pictures
so
much
and
would
have
enjoyed
every
moment
of
this
chance
interview
he
was
not
a
very
young
man
nor
a
handsome
one
but
he
had
a
genial
face
and
the
friendly
manners
which
are
so
charming
and
in
ten
minutes
jessie
was
chatting
freely
quite
unconscious
that
the
artist
was
studying
her
in
a
mirror
all
the
while
they
naturally
talked
of
the
children
and
after
praising
the
pretty
dance
vane
quietly
added
i
been
trying
to
find
a
face
among
them
for
a
picture
doing
but
the
little
dears
are
all
too
young
and
i
must
look
elsewhere
for
a
model
for
my
are
models
hard
to
find
asked
jessie
eating
her
ice
with
the
relish
of
a
girl
who
does
not
often
taste
it
what
i
want
is
very
hard
to
find
i
can
get
plenty
of
but
this
must
be
a
refined
face
young
and
blooming
but
with
poetry
in
it
and
that
does
not
come
without
a
different
training
from
any
my
usual
models
get
it
will
be
difficult
to
suit
me
for
i
in
a
hurry
and
do
know
where
to
look
which
last
sentence
was
not
quite
true
for
the
long
glass
showed
him
exactly
what
he
wanted
i
help
mademoiselle
with
her
classes
and
she
has
pupils
of
all
ages
perhaps
you
could
find
some
one
jessie
looked
so
interested
that
the
artist
felt
that
he
had
begun
well
and
ventured
a
step
further
as
he
passed
the
for
the
third
time
you
are
very
kind
but
the
trouble
there
is
that
i
fear
none
of
the
young
ladies
would
consent
to
sit
to
me
if
i
dared
to
ask
them
i
will
confide
to
you
that
i
have
seen
a
head
which
quite
suits
me
but
i
fear
i
can
not
get
it
give
me
your
advice
please
should
you
think
this
pretty
creature
would
be
offended
if
i
made
the
request
most
respectfully
no
indeed
i
should
think
she
would
be
proud
to
help
with
one
of
your
pictures
sir
my
sister
thinks
they
are
very
lovely
and
we
kept
one
of
them
when
we
had
to
sell
all
the
rest
said
jessie
in
her
eager
frank
way
that
was
a
beautiful
compliment
and
i
am
proud
of
it
please
tell
her
so
with
my
thanks
which
was
it
the
woman
head
the
sad
sweet
one
people
call
a
madonna
we
call
it
mother
and
love
it
very
much
for
laura
says
it
is
like
our
mother
i
never
saw
her
but
my
sister
remembers
the
dear
face
very
jessie
eyes
dropped
as
if
tears
were
near
and
vane
said
in
a
voice
which
showed
he
understood
and
shared
her
feeling
i
am
very
glad
that
anything
of
mine
has
been
a
comfort
to
you
i
thought
of
my
own
mother
when
i
painted
that
picture
years
ago
so
you
see
you
read
it
truly
and
gave
it
the
right
name
now
about
the
other
head
you
think
i
may
venture
to
propose
the
idea
to
its
owner
do
you
why
not
sir
she
would
be
very
silly
to
refuse
i
then
you
would
be
offended
if
asked
to
sit
in
this
way
oh
no
i
sat
for
laura
many
a
time
and
she
says
i
make
a
very
good
model
but
then
she
only
paints
simple
little
things
that
i
am
fit
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
do
would
you
mind
asking
the
young
lady
for
me
she
is
just
behind
jessie
turned
with
a
start
wondering
who
had
come
in
but
all
she
saw
was
her
own
curious
face
in
the
mirror
and
vane
smiling
one
above
it
do
you
mean
me
she
cried
so
surprised
and
pleased
and
half
ashamed
that
she
could
only
blush
and
laugh
and
look
prettier
than
ever
indeed
i
do
murray
thought
the
request
would
annoy
you
but
i
fancied
you
would
grant
it
you
wore
such
a
graceful
little
garland
and
seemed
so
interested
in
the
pictures
it
is
only
a
bit
of
ivy
but
so
pretty
i
wanted
to
wear
it
as
i
had
nothing
else
said
the
girl
glad
that
her
simple
ornament
found
favor
in
such
eyes
it
is
most
artistic
and
caught
my
eye
at
once
i
said
to
myself
that
is
the
head
i
want
and
i
must
secure
it
if
possible
can
i
asked
vane
smiling
persuasively
as
he
saw
what
a
frank
and
artless
young
person
he
had
to
deal
with
with
pleasure
if
laura
does
mind
i
ask
her
and
if
she
is
willing
i
shall
be
very
proud
to
have
even
my
wreath
in
a
famous
picture
answered
jessie
so
full
of
innocent
delight
at
being
thus
honored
that
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
a
thousand
thanks
now
i
can
exult
over
murray
and
get
my
palette
ready
when
can
we
begin
as
your
sister
is
an
invalid
and
can
not
come
to
my
studio
with
you
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
make
my
sketch
at
your
own
house
said
vane
as
pleased
with
his
success
as
only
a
perplexed
artist
could
be
did
murray
tell
you
about
us
asked
jessie
quickly
as
her
smiles
faded
away
and
the
proud
look
came
into
her
face
for
she
was
sure
their
misfortunes
were
known
since
he
spoke
of
poor
health
a
little
began
the
new
friend
with
a
sympathetic
glance
i
know
models
are
paid
for
sitting
did
you
wish
to
do
it
with
me
because
i
poor
asked
jessie
with
an
irrepressible
frown
and
a
glance
at
the
dress
and
the
neatly
mended
gloves
vane
knew
what
thorn
pricked
the
sensitive
little
girl
and
answered
in
his
friendliest
tone
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
i
wanted
you
to
help
me
because
i
am
poor
in
what
artists
so
much
need
real
grace
and
beauty
i
hoped
you
would
allow
me
to
give
your
sister
a
copy
of
the
sketch
as
a
token
of
my
gratitude
for
your
great
the
frown
vanished
and
the
smile
returned
as
the
soft
answer
turned
away
jessie
wrath
and
made
her
hasten
to
say
penitently
i
was
very
rude
but
i
have
learned
to
be
humble
yet
and
often
forget
that
i
am
poor
please
come
to
us
any
time
laura
will
enjoy
seeing
you
work
and
be
delighted
with
anything
you
give
her
so
shall
i
though
i
do
deserve
i
wo
punish
you
by
painting
the
frown
that
quite
frightened
me
just
now
but
do
my
best
to
keep
the
happy
face
and
so
heap
coals
of
fire
on
your
head
they
wo
burn
any
more
than
the
pretty
red
leaves
that
brought
me
this
good
fortune
answered
the
artist
seeing
that
his
peace
was
made
i
so
glad
i
wore
them
and
as
if
trying
to
make
amends
for
her
little
flash
of
temper
jessie
told
him
about
the
ivy
and
how
she
loved
it
unconsciously
betraying
more
of
her
pathetic
little
story
than
she
knew
and
increasing
her
hearer
interest
in
his
new
model
the
children
came
back
in
riotous
spirits
and
jessie
was
called
to
lead
the
revels
again
but
now
her
heart
was
as
light
as
her
heels
for
she
had
something
pleasant
to
think
of
a
hope
of
help
for
laura
and
the
memory
of
kind
words
to
make
hard
duties
easier
vane
soon
slipped
away
promising
to
come
the
next
day
and
at
eight
jessie
ran
home
to
tell
her
sister
the
good
news
and
to
press
the
little
wreath
which
had
served
her
so
well
with
the
sanguine
spirit
of
girlhood
she
felt
sure
that
something
delightful
would
happen
and
built
fine
castles
in
the
air
for
her
sister
with
a
small
corner
for
herself
where
she
could
watch
laura
bloom
into
a
healthy
woman
and
a
great
artist
the
desire
of
jessie
heart
was
to
earn
eneugh
money
to
enable
them
to
spend
a
month
or
two
at
the
seashore
when
summer
came
as
that
was
the
surest
cure
for
laura
weak
nerves
and
muscles
she
had
cherished
the
wild
idea
of
being
a
as
dancing
was
her
delight
but
every
one
frowned
upon
that
plan
and
her
own
refined
nature
told
her
that
it
was
not
the
life
for
a
young
girl
request
for
her
head
suggested
a
splendid
hope
and
after
getting
angry
with
him
for
hinting
at
her
being
a
model
she
suddenly
decided
to
try
it
with
the
charming
inconsistency
of
her
sex
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
better
she
liked
the
idea
and
resolved
to
ask
her
new
friend
all
about
it
fondly
hoping
that
much
money
could
be
made
in
this
way
she
said
nothing
to
her
sister
but
while
she
sat
patiently
to
vane
when
he
came
next
day
she
asked
many
questions
and
though
somewhat
discouraged
by
his
replies
confided
to
him
her
hopes
and
begged
his
advice
being
a
wise
man
as
well
as
a
good
and
kindly
one
he
saw
at
once
that
this
life
would
not
be
safe
for
the
pretty
impulsive
and
tenderly
reared
girl
left
so
unprotected
in
a
world
full
of
trials
and
temptations
so
he
told
her
it
would
not
do
except
so
far
as
she
would
allow
him
to
make
several
studies
of
her
head
in
various
characters
and
pay
for
them
she
consented
and
though
much
disappointed
found
some
consolation
in
hoarding
a
part
of
the
handsome
sum
so
earned
for
the
desire
of
her
heart
the
artist
seemed
in
no
haste
to
finish
his
work
and
for
some
weeks
came
often
to
the
sittings
in
that
quiet
room
for
it
grew
more
and
more
attractive
to
him
and
while
he
painted
the
younger
changeful
face
he
studied
the
beautiful
nature
of
the
elder
and
learned
to
love
it
but
no
one
guessed
that
secret
for
a
long
time
and
jessie
was
so
busy
racking
her
brain
for
a
way
to
earn
more
money
that
she
was
as
blind
and
deaf
to
much
that
went
on
before
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
wooden
dummy
suddenly
when
she
least
expected
it
help
came
and
in
such
a
delightful
way
that
she
long
remembered
the
little
episode
with
girlish
satisfaction
one
day
as
she
sat
wearily
waiting
till
the
was
cleared
of
maids
and
children
after
the
was
over
a
former
friend
came
sauntering
up
to
her
saying
in
the
tone
which
always
nettled
jessie
you
poor
thing
are
you
tired
to
death
trying
to
teach
these
stupid
babies
no
i
love
to
dance
and
we
had
new
figures
see
is
this
pretty
and
jessie
who
knew
her
own
skill
and
loved
to
display
it
twirled
away
as
lightly
as
if
her
feet
were
not
aching
with
two
hours
of
hard
work
lovely
i
do
wish
i
ever
could
learn
to
keep
time
and
not
jerk
and
bounce
being
plump
is
a
dreadful
trial
sighed
fanny
fletcher
as
jessie
came
back
beaming
and
breathless
perhaps
i
can
teach
you
i
think
of
making
this
my
profession
since
i
must
do
something
mademoiselle
earns
heaps
of
money
by
it
she
said
sitting
down
to
rest
resolved
not
to
be
ashamed
of
her
work
or
to
let
fanny
pity
her
i
wish
you
could
teach
me
for
i
know
i
shall
disgrace
myself
at
the
kirmess
you
heard
about
it
of
course
so
sorry
you
take
a
part
for
it
going
to
be
great
fun
and
very
splendid
i
am
in
the
hungarian
dance
and
it
one
of
the
hardest
but
the
dress
is
lovely
and
i
would
be
in
it
mamma
is
the
matron
of
it
so
i
had
my
way
though
i
know
the
girls
do
want
me
and
the
boys
make
fun
of
me
just
see
if
this
is
the
queerest
step
you
ever
beheld
fanny
started
bravely
across
the
wide
smooth
floor
with
a
stamp
a
slide
and
a
twirl
which
was
certainly
odd
but
might
have
been
lively
and
graceful
if
she
had
not
unfortunately
been
a
very
plump
awkward
girl
with
no
more
elasticity
than
a
jessie
found
it
impossible
not
to
laugh
when
fanny
ended
her
display
with
a
sprawl
upon
the
floor
and
sat
rubbing
her
elbows
in
an
attitude
of
despair
i
know
that
dance
it
is
the
tzardas
and
i
can
show
you
how
it
should
be
done
jump
up
and
try
it
with
me
she
said
running
to
help
her
friend
up
glad
to
have
a
partner
of
her
own
size
for
once
away
they
went
but
soon
stopped
for
fanny
could
not
keep
step
and
jessie
pulled
and
stamped
and
hummed
in
vain
do
it
alone
then
i
can
see
how
it
goes
and
manage
better
next
time
panted
the
poor
girl
dropping
down
upon
the
velvet
seat
which
ran
round
the
hall
mademoiselle
had
come
in
and
watched
them
for
a
moment
she
saw
at
once
what
was
needed
and
as
fletcher
was
one
of
her
best
patrons
she
was
glad
to
oblige
the
oldest
daughter
so
she
went
to
the
piano
and
struck
up
the
proper
air
just
as
jessie
with
one
arm
on
her
hip
the
other
on
the
shoulder
of
an
invisible
partner
went
down
the
hall
with
a
martial
stamp
a
quick
slide
and
a
graceful
turn
in
perfect
time
to
the
stirring
music
that
made
her
nerves
tingle
and
her
feet
fly
to
and
fro
round
and
round
with
all
manner
of
graceful
gestures
intricate
steps
and
active
bounds
went
the
happy
girl
quite
carried
away
by
the
music
and
motion
of
the
pastime
she
loved
so
much
fanny
clapped
her
hands
with
admiration
and
mademoiselle
cried
bien
tres
bien
charmante
ma
cherie
as
she
paused
at
last
rosy
and
smiling
with
one
hand
on
her
heart
and
the
other
at
her
temple
with
the
salute
that
closed
the
dance
i
must
learn
it
do
come
and
give
me
lessons
at
our
house
i
called
for
maud
and
must
go
now
will
you
come
jessie
i
be
glad
to
pay
you
if
you
do
mind
i
hate
to
be
laughed
at
and
i
know
if
some
one
would
just
help
me
alone
i
should
do
as
well
as
the
rest
for
professor
ludwig
raves
at
us
fanny
seemed
in
such
a
sad
strait
and
jessie
sympathized
so
heartily
with
her
that
she
could
not
refuse
a
request
which
flattered
her
vanity
and
tempted
her
with
a
prospect
of
some
addition
to
the
as
she
called
her
little
savings
so
she
graciously
consented
and
after
a
few
laborious
lessons
prospered
so
well
that
her
grateful
pupil
proposed
to
several
other
unsuccessful
dancers
in
the
set
to
invite
jessie
to
the
private
rehearsals
held
in
various
parlors
as
the
festival
drew
near
some
of
these
young
people
knew
jessie
delano
had
missed
the
bright
girl
and
gladly
welcomed
her
back
when
after
much
persuasion
she
agreed
to
go
and
help
them
with
the
difficult
figures
of
the
tzardas
once
among
them
she
felt
in
her
element
and
trained
the
awkward
squad
so
well
that
professor
ludwig
complimented
them
on
their
improvement
at
the
public
rehearsals
and
raved
no
more
to
the
great
delight
of
the
timid
damsels
who
lost
their
wits
when
the
fiery
little
man
shouted
and
wrung
his
hands
over
their
mistakes
the
young
gentlemen
needed
help
also
as
several
of
them
looked
very
much
like
galvanized
grasshoppers
in
their
efforts
to
manage
long
legs
or
awkward
elbows
jessie
willingly
danced
with
them
and
showed
them
how
to
move
with
grace
and
spirit
and
handle
their
partners
less
like
dolls
and
more
like
peasant
maidens
with
whom
the
martial
hungarians
were
supposed
to
be
disporting
themselves
at
the
fair
merry
meetings
were
these
and
all
enjoyed
them
as
young
people
do
whatever
is
lively
dramatic
and
social
every
one
was
full
of
the
brilliant
kirmess
which
was
the
talk
of
the
city
and
to
which
every
one
intended
to
go
as
actor
or
spectator
jessie
was
sadly
tempted
to
spend
three
of
her
cherished
dollars
for
a
ticket
and
perhaps
would
have
done
so
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
take
care
of
her
laura
could
not
go
and
vane
was
away
no
other
friend
appeared
and
no
one
remembered
to
invite
her
so
she
bravely
hid
her
girlish
longing
and
got
all
the
pleasure
out
of
the
rehearsals
that
she
could
at
the
last
of
these
which
was
a
affair
at
house
something
happened
which
not
only
tried
jessie
temper
sorely
but
brought
her
a
reward
for
many
small
sacrifices
so
much
dancing
was
very
hard
upon
her
slippers
the
new
pair
were
worn
out
long
ago
and
a
second
pair
were
in
a
dangerous
condition
but
jessie
hoped
that
they
would
last
that
evening
and
then
she
would
indulge
in
better
ones
with
what
fanny
would
pay
her
she
hated
to
take
it
but
her
salary
at
mademoiselle
was
needed
at
home
all
she
could
spare
from
other
sources
was
sacredly
kept
for
jaunt
and
only
now
and
then
did
the
good
little
girl
buy
some
very
necessary
article
for
herself
she
was
learning
to
be
humble
to
love
work
and
be
grateful
for
her
small
wages
for
her
sake
and
while
she
hid
her
trials
withstood
her
temptations
and
bravely
tugged
away
at
her
hard
tasks
the
kind
providence
who
teaches
us
the
sweetness
of
adversity
was
preparing
a
more
beautiful
and
helpful
surprise
than
any
she
could
plan
or
execute
that
night
all
were
much
excited
and
great
was
the
energy
displayed
as
the
scarlet
blue
and
silver
couples
went
through
the
rapid
figures
with
unusual
spirit
and
success
the
boots
stamped
in
perfect
time
the
furred
caps
waved
and
the
braided
jackets
glittered
as
the
gay
troop
swung
to
and
fro
or
marched
to
the
barbaric
music
of
an
impromptu
band
jessie
looked
on
with
such
longing
in
her
eyes
that
fanny
who
was
ill
with
a
bad
cold
kindly
begged
her
to
take
her
place
as
motion
made
her
cough
and
putting
on
the
red
and
silver
cap
sent
her
joyfully
away
to
lead
them
all
the
fun
grew
rather
fast
and
furious
toward
the
end
and
when
the
dance
broke
up
there
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
shabby
little
slipper
burst
at
the
side
trodden
down
at
the
heel
and
utterly
demoralized
as
to
the
bow
with
a
broken
buckle
in
it
such
a
disreputable
little
shoe
was
it
that
no
one
claimed
it
when
one
of
the
young
men
held
it
up
on
the
point
of
his
sword
exclaiming
gayly
where
is
cinderella
here
her
shoe
and
it
quite
time
she
had
a
new
pair
glass
evidently
does
wear
well
they
all
laughed
and
looked
about
to
find
the
shoeless
foot
the
girls
with
small
feet
displayed
them
readily
those
less
blessed
hid
them
at
once
and
no
cinderella
appeared
to
claim
the
old
slipper
jessie
turned
as
red
as
her
cap
and
glanced
imploringly
at
fanny
as
she
slipped
through
a
convenient
door
and
flew
knowing
that
in
a
moment
all
would
see
that
it
must
be
hers
since
the
other
girls
wore
red
boots
as
a
part
of
their
costume
fanny
understood
and
though
awkward
and
slow
with
her
feet
she
was
and
quick
to
spare
her
friend
the
mortification
which
a
poor
and
proud
girl
could
not
help
feeling
at
such
a
moment
the
unfortunate
slipper
was
flying
from
hand
to
hand
as
the
youths
indulged
in
a
boyish
game
of
ball
to
tease
the
laughing
girls
who
hastened
to
disclaim
all
knowledge
of
the
horrid
please
give
it
to
me
cried
fanny
trying
to
catch
it
and
glad
jessie
was
safe
no
cinderella
must
come
and
put
it
on
here
the
prince
all
ready
to
help
her
said
the
finder
of
the
shoe
holding
it
up
and
here
are
lots
of
proud
sisters
ready
to
cut
off
their
toes
and
heels
if
they
could
only
get
on
such
a
small
slipper
added
another
young
mygar
enjoying
the
fun
immensely
listen
and
let
me
tell
you
something
it
jessie
delano
and
she
has
run
away
because
she
lost
it
do
laugh
and
make
fun
of
it
because
it
was
worn
out
in
helping
us
you
all
know
what
a
hard
time
she
has
had
but
you
do
know
how
good
and
brave
and
patient
she
is
trying
to
help
poor
laura
and
to
earn
her
living
i
asked
her
to
teach
me
and
i
shall
pay
her
well
for
it
because
i
have
gone
on
if
she
had
if
any
of
you
feel
as
grateful
as
i
do
and
as
sorry
for
her
you
can
show
it
in
any
kind
way
you
please
for
it
must
be
dreadful
to
be
so
fanny
had
spoken
quickly
and
at
the
last
words
hid
the
tremble
in
her
voice
with
a
cough
being
rather
scared
at
what
she
had
done
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
but
it
was
a
true
impulse
and
the
generous
young
hearts
were
quick
to
answer
it
the
old
slipper
was
respectfully
handed
to
her
with
many
apologies
and
various
penitent
suggestions
none
were
adopted
just
then
however
for
fanny
ran
off
to
find
jessie
with
her
things
on
waiting
for
a
chance
to
slip
away
unseen
no
persuasions
would
keep
her
to
supper
and
at
last
with
many
thanks
she
was
allowed
to
go
while
fanny
returned
to
lay
plans
with
her
guests
as
they
disturbed
their
digestions
with
lobster
salad
and
strong
coffee
feeling
more
than
ever
like
cinderella
as
she
hurried
out
into
the
winter
night
leaving
all
the
good
times
behind
her
jessie
stood
waiting
for
a
car
on
the
windy
with
the
ragged
slippers
under
her
arm
tears
of
weariness
and
vexation
in
her
eyes
and
a
resentful
feeling
against
an
unjust
fate
lying
heavy
at
her
heart
the
glimpses
of
her
old
gay
easy
life
which
these
rehearsals
had
given
her
made
the
real
hardship
and
loneliness
of
her
present
life
all
the
more
irksome
and
that
night
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
bear
it
much
longer
she
longed
with
all
a
girl
love
of
gayety
to
go
to
the
kirmess
and
no
one
thought
to
invite
her
she
could
not
go
alone
even
if
she
yielded
to
temptation
and
spent
her
own
money
laura
would
have
to
hire
a
carriage
if
she
ventured
to
try
it
so
it
was
impossible
for
six
or
seven
dollars
was
a
fortune
to
the
poor
girls
now
to
have
been
one
of
the
happy
creatures
who
were
to
take
part
in
it
to
dance
on
the
green
in
a
dainty
costume
to
the
music
of
a
full
band
to
see
and
do
and
enjoy
all
the
delights
of
those
two
enchanting
evenings
would
have
filled
jessie
cup
to
overflowing
but
since
she
might
as
well
cry
for
the
moon
she
tried
to
get
some
comfort
out
of
imagining
it
all
as
she
rumbled
home
in
a
snowstorm
and
cried
herself
to
sleep
after
giving
laura
a
cheerful
account
of
the
rehearsal
omitting
the
catastrophe
the
sun
shone
next
morning
hope
woke
again
and
as
she
dressed
jessie
sung
to
keep
her
heart
up
still
trusting
that
some
one
would
remember
her
before
the
day
was
over
as
she
opened
her
windows
the
sparrows
welcomed
her
with
shrill
chirpings
and
the
sun
turned
the
vine
to
a
glittering
network
very
beautiful
to
see
as
it
hung
like
a
veil
of
lace
over
the
dingy
wall
jessie
smiled
as
she
saw
it
while
taking
a
long
breath
of
the
keen
air
feeling
cheered
and
refreshed
by
these
familiar
comforters
then
with
a
brave
bright
glance
up
at
the
clear
blue
sky
she
went
away
to
the
day
duties
little
guessing
what
pleasant
surprises
were
on
their
way
to
reward
her
for
the
little
sacrifices
which
were
teaching
her
strength
patience
and
courage
for
greater
ones
all
the
morning
she
listened
eagerly
for
the
bell
but
nothing
came
and
at
two
she
went
away
to
the
saying
to
herself
with
a
sigh
every
one
is
so
busy
it
is
no
wonder
i
forgotten
i
shall
hear
about
the
fun
in
the
papers
and
try
to
be
contented
with
though
she
never
felt
less
like
dancing
she
was
very
patient
with
her
little
pupils
and
when
the
lesson
was
over
sat
resting
a
moment
with
her
head
still
full
of
the
glories
of
the
kirmess
suddenly
mademoiselle
came
to
her
and
in
a
few
kind
words
gave
her
the
first
of
the
pleasant
surprises
by
offering
her
a
larger
salary
an
older
class
and
many
commendations
for
her
skill
and
faithfulness
of
course
she
gratefully
accepted
the
welcome
offer
and
hurried
home
to
tell
laura
forgetting
her
heavy
heart
tired
feet
and
disappointed
hopes
at
her
own
door
the
second
surprise
stood
waiting
for
her
in
the
person
of
fletcher
servant
with
a
large
box
and
a
note
from
miss
fanny
how
she
ever
got
herself
and
her
parcel
up
the
long
stairs
jessie
never
knew
she
was
in
such
a
frantic
hurry
to
see
what
that
vast
box
could
contain
she
startled
her
sister
by
bursting
into
the
room
breathless
flushed
and
beaming
with
the
mysterious
cry
of
scissors
quick
the
scissors
off
went
cords
and
papers
up
flew
the
cover
and
with
a
shriek
of
rapture
jessie
saw
the
hungarian
costume
lying
there
before
her
what
it
all
meant
she
could
not
guess
till
she
tore
open
the
note
and
read
these
delightful
words
dear
jess
my
cold
is
worse
and
the
doctor
wo
let
me
go
is
it
dreadful
our
dance
will
be
ruined
unless
you
will
take
my
place
i
know
you
will
to
oblige
us
and
have
a
lovely
time
every
one
will
be
glad
you
do
it
so
much
better
than
i
can
my
dress
will
fit
you
with
tucks
and
reefs
here
and
there
and
the
boots
wo
be
much
too
large
for
though
i
fat
i
have
small
feet
thank
goodness
mamma
will
call
for
you
at
seven
and
bring
you
safely
home
and
you
must
come
early
and
tell
me
all
about
it
in
the
small
box
you
will
find
a
little
token
of
our
gratitude
to
you
for
your
kindness
in
helping
us
all
so
much
yours
ever
fan
as
soon
as
jessie
could
get
her
breath
and
recover
from
this
first
delightful
shock
she
opened
the
dainty
parcel
carefully
tied
up
with
pink
ribbons
it
proved
to
be
a
crystal
slipper
apparently
full
of
rosebuds
but
under
the
flowers
lay
shining
gold
dollars
a
little
card
with
these
words
was
tucked
in
one
corner
as
if
with
all
their
devices
to
make
the
offering
as
delicate
and
pretty
as
possible
the
givers
feared
to
offend
we
return
to
our
dear
princess
the
glass
slipper
which
she
lost
at
the
ball
full
of
thanks
and
good
if
the
kind
young
persons
who
sent
the
fanciful
gift
could
have
seen
how
it
was
received
their
doubts
would
soon
have
been
set
at
rest
for
jessie
laughed
and
cried
as
she
told
the
story
counted
the
precious
coins
and
filled
the
pretty
shoe
with
water
that
the
buds
might
keep
fresh
for
laura
then
while
the
needles
flew
and
the
gay
garments
were
fitted
the
happy
voices
talked
and
the
sisters
rejoiced
together
over
this
unexpected
pleasure
as
only
loving
girls
could
do
the
sweetest
part
of
all
the
splendid
surprise
is
that
they
remembered
me
just
at
the
busiest
time
and
thanked
me
in
such
a
lovely
way
i
shall
keep
that
glass
slipper
all
my
life
if
i
can
to
remind
me
not
to
despair
for
just
when
everything
seemed
darkest
all
this
good
luck
came
said
jessie
with
ecstatic
skips
as
she
clanked
the
brass
heels
of
her
boots
and
thought
of
the
proud
moment
when
she
would
join
in
the
tzardas
before
all
boston
gentle
laura
rejoiced
and
sympathized
heartily
sewed
like
a
busy
bee
and
sent
her
happy
sister
away
at
seven
with
her
sweetest
smile
never
letting
her
suspect
what
tender
hopes
and
fears
were
hidden
in
her
own
heart
what
longing
and
disappointment
made
her
days
doubly
sad
and
lonely
or
how
very
poor
a
consolation
all
the
glories
of
the
kirmess
would
be
for
the
loss
of
a
friend
who
had
grown
very
near
and
dear
to
her
no
need
to
tell
the
raptures
of
that
evening
to
little
jessie
who
enjoyed
every
moment
played
her
part
well
and
was
brought
home
at
midnight
ready
to
begin
all
over
again
so
inexhaustible
is
appetite
for
pleasure
to
her
great
surprise
laura
was
up
and
waiting
to
welcome
her
with
a
face
so
full
of
a
new
and
lovely
happiness
that
jessie
guessed
at
once
some
good
fortune
had
come
to
her
also
yes
reward
and
beautiful
surprise
had
arrived
at
last
and
she
told
it
all
in
a
few
words
as
she
held
out
her
arms
exclaiming
he
has
come
back
he
loves
me
and
i
am
so
happy
dear
little
sister
all
your
hard
times
are
over
now
and
you
shall
have
a
home
so
the
dreams
came
true
as
they
sometimes
do
even
in
this
world
of
ours
when
the
dreamers
strive
as
well
as
hope
and
earn
their
rewards
laura
had
a
restful
summer
at
the
seaside
with
a
stronger
arm
than
jessie
to
lean
upon
and
more
magical
medicine
to
help
her
back
to
health
than
any
mortal
doctor
could
prescribe
jessie
danced
again
with
a
light
heart
for
pleasure
not
for
pay
and
found
the
new
life
all
the
sweeter
for
the
trials
of
the
old
one
in
the
autumn
there
was
a
quiet
wedding
before
three
very
happy
people
sailed
away
to
italy
the
artist
heaven
on
earth
no
roses
for
me
said
jessie
smiling
at
herself
in
the
mirror
as
she
fastened
a
spray
of
rosy
in
the
bosom
of
her
fresh
white
gown
that
october
morning
i
be
true
to
my
old
friend
for
it
helped
me
in
my
dark
days
and
now
it
shall
rejoice
with
me
in
my
bright
ones
and
go
on
teaching
me
to
climb
bravely
and
patiently
toward
the
pansies
they
are
never
alone
that
are
accompanied
with
noble
sir
philip
sidney
i
finished
my
book
and
now
what
can
i
do
till
this
tiresome
rain
is
over
exclaimed
carrie
as
she
lay
back
on
the
couch
with
a
yawn
of
weariness
take
another
and
a
better
book
the
house
is
full
of
them
and
this
is
a
rare
chance
for
a
feast
on
the
best
answered
alice
looking
over
the
pile
of
volumes
in
her
lap
as
she
sat
on
the
floor
before
one
of
the
tall
that
lined
the
room
not
being
a
like
you
i
ca
read
forever
and
you
need
sniff
at
for
it
perfectly
thrilling
cried
carrie
regretfully
turning
the
crumpled
leaves
of
the
seaside
library
copy
of
that
interminable
and
impossible
tale
we
should
read
to
improve
our
minds
and
that
rubbish
is
only
a
waste
of
time
began
alice
in
a
warning
tone
as
she
looked
up
from
romola
over
which
she
had
been
poring
with
the
delight
one
feels
in
meeting
an
old
friend
i
do
wish
to
improve
my
mind
thank
you
i
read
for
amusement
in
vacation
time
and
do
want
to
see
any
moral
works
till
next
autumn
i
get
enough
of
them
in
school
this
is
full
of
fine
descriptions
of
scenery
which
you
skip
by
the
page
i
seen
you
do
it
said
eva
the
third
young
girl
in
the
library
as
she
shut
up
the
stout
book
on
her
knee
and
began
to
knit
as
if
this
sudden
outburst
of
chat
disturbed
her
enjoyment
of
the
dove
in
the
eagle
i
do
at
first
being
carried
away
by
my
interest
in
the
people
but
i
almost
always
go
back
and
read
them
afterward
protested
carrie
you
know
you
like
to
hear
about
nice
clothes
eva
and
wanda
were
simply
gorgeous
white
velvet
and
a
rope
of
pearls
is
one
costume
gray
velvet
and
a
silver
girdle
another
and
idalia
was
all
a
of
perfumed
laces
and
scarlet
and
gold
satin
mask
dresses
or
primrose
silk
with
violets
so
lovely
i
do
revel
in
both
girls
laughed
as
carrie
reeled
off
this
list
of
elegances
with
the
relish
of
a
french
modiste
well
i
poor
and
ca
have
as
many
pretty
things
as
i
want
so
it
is
delightful
to
read
about
women
who
wear
white
quilted
satin
and
olive
velvet
trains
with
mechlin
lace
sweepers
to
them
diamonds
as
large
as
nuts
and
rivers
of
opals
and
sapphires
and
rubies
and
pearls
are
great
fun
to
read
of
if
you
never
even
get
a
look
at
real
ones
i
do
believe
the
love
part
does
me
a
bit
of
harm
for
we
never
see
such
languid
swells
in
america
nor
such
lovely
naughty
ladies
and
ouida
scolds
them
all
so
of
course
she
does
approve
of
them
and
that
moral
i
but
alice
shook
her
head
again
as
carrie
paused
out
of
breath
and
said
in
her
serious
way
that
the
harm
of
it
all
false
and
foolish
things
are
made
interesting
and
we
read
for
that
not
for
any
lesson
there
may
be
hidden
under
the
velvet
and
jewels
and
fine
words
of
your
splendid
men
and
women
now
this
book
is
a
wonderful
picture
of
florence
in
old
times
and
the
famous
people
who
really
lived
are
painted
in
it
and
it
has
a
true
and
clean
moral
that
we
can
all
see
and
one
feels
wiser
and
better
for
reading
it
i
do
wish
you
leave
those
trashy
things
and
try
something
really
i
hate
george
eliot
so
awfully
wise
and
preachy
and
dismal
i
really
could
wade
through
deronda
though
mill
on
the
floss
was
bad
answered
carrie
with
another
yawn
as
she
recalled
the
jew
mordecai
long
speeches
and
daniel
meditations
i
know
you
like
this
said
eva
patting
her
book
with
an
air
of
calm
content
for
she
was
a
modest
little
body
full
of
innocent
fancies
and
the
mildest
sort
of
romance
i
love
dear
miss
yonge
with
her
nice
large
families
and
their
trials
and
their
pious
ways
and
pleasant
homes
full
of
brothers
and
sisters
and
good
fathers
and
mothers
i
never
tired
of
them
and
have
read
chain
nine
times
at
i
used
to
like
them
and
still
think
them
good
for
young
girls
with
our
own
and
wide
world
and
books
of
that
kind
now
i
eighteen
i
prefer
stronger
novels
and
books
by
great
men
and
women
because
these
are
always
talked
about
by
cultivated
people
and
when
i
go
into
society
next
winter
i
wish
to
be
able
to
listen
intelligently
and
know
what
to
that
all
very
well
for
you
alice
you
were
always
poking
over
books
and
i
dare
say
you
will
write
them
some
day
or
be
a
but
i
got
another
year
to
study
and
fuss
over
my
education
and
i
going
to
enjoy
myself
all
i
can
and
leave
the
wise
books
till
i
come
but
carrie
there
wo
be
any
time
to
read
them
you
be
so
busy
with
parties
and
beaux
and
travelling
and
such
things
i
would
take
alice
advice
and
read
up
a
little
now
it
so
nice
to
know
useful
things
and
be
able
to
find
help
and
comfort
in
good
books
when
trouble
comes
as
ellen
montgomery
and
fleda
did
and
ethel
and
the
other
girls
in
miss
yonge
stories
said
eva
earnestly
remembering
how
much
the
efforts
of
those
natural
little
heroines
had
helped
her
in
her
own
struggles
tor
and
the
cheerful
bearing
of
the
burdens
which
come
to
all
i
do
want
to
be
a
priggish
ellen
or
a
moral
fleda
and
i
do
detest
bothering
about
all
the
time
i
know
i
ought
but
i
rather
wait
another
year
or
two
and
enjoy
my
vanities
in
peace
just
a
little
and
carrie
tucked
wanda
under
the
sofa
pillow
as
if
a
trifle
ashamed
of
her
society
with
eva
innocent
eyes
upon
her
own
and
alice
sadly
regarding
her
over
the
rampart
of
wise
books
which
kept
growing
higher
as
the
eager
girl
found
more
and
more
treasures
in
this
richly
stored
library
a
little
silence
followed
broken
only
by
the
patter
of
the
rain
without
the
crackle
of
the
wood
fire
within
and
the
scratch
of
a
busy
pen
from
a
curtained
recess
at
the
end
of
the
long
room
in
the
sudden
hush
the
girls
heard
it
and
remembered
that
they
were
not
alone
she
must
have
heard
every
word
we
said
and
carrie
sat
up
with
a
dismayed
face
as
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
eva
laughed
but
alice
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
tranquilly
i
do
mind
she
would
expect
much
wisdom
from
this
was
cold
comfort
to
carrie
who
was
painfully
conscious
of
having
been
a
particularly
silly
just
then
so
she
gave
a
groan
and
lay
down
again
wishing
she
had
not
expressed
her
views
quite
so
freely
and
had
kept
wanda
for
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
the
three
girls
were
the
guests
of
a
delightful
old
lady
who
had
known
their
mothers
and
was
fond
of
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
them
through
their
daughters
she
loved
young
people
and
each
summer
invited
parties
of
them
to
enjoy
the
delights
of
her
beautiful
country
house
where
she
lived
alone
now
being
the
childless
widow
of
a
somewhat
celebrated
man
she
made
it
very
pleasant
for
her
guests
leaving
them
free
to
employ
a
part
of
the
day
as
they
liked
providing
the
best
of
company
at
dinner
gay
revels
in
the
evening
and
a
large
house
full
of
curious
and
interesting
things
to
examine
at
their
leisure
the
rain
had
spoiled
a
pleasant
plan
and
business
letters
had
made
it
necessary
for
warburton
to
leave
the
three
to
their
own
devices
after
lunch
they
had
read
quietly
for
several
hours
and
their
hostess
was
just
finishing
her
last
letter
when
fragments
of
the
conversation
reached
her
ear
she
listened
with
amusement
unconscious
that
they
had
forgotten
her
presence
finding
the
different
views
very
characteristic
and
easily
explained
by
the
difference
of
the
homes
out
of
which
the
three
friends
came
alice
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
scholarly
man
and
a
brilliant
woman
therefore
her
love
of
books
and
desire
to
cultivate
her
mind
was
very
natural
but
the
danger
in
her
case
would
be
in
the
neglect
of
other
things
equally
important
too
varied
reading
and
a
superficial
knowledge
of
many
authors
rather
than
a
true
appreciation
of
a
few
of
the
best
and
greatest
eva
was
one
of
many
children
in
a
happy
home
with
a
busy
father
a
pious
mother
and
many
domestic
cares
as
well
as
joys
already
falling
to
the
dutiful
girl
lot
her
instincts
were
sweet
and
unspoiled
and
she
only
needed
to
be
shown
where
to
find
new
and
better
helpers
for
the
real
trials
of
life
when
the
childish
heroines
she
loved
could
no
longer
serve
her
in
the
years
to
come
carrie
was
one
of
the
ambitious
yet
commonplace
girls
who
wish
to
shine
without
knowing
the
difference
between
the
glitter
of
a
candle
which
attracts
moths
and
the
serene
light
of
a
star
or
the
cheery
glow
of
a
fire
round
which
all
love
to
gather
her
aims
were
not
high
and
the
two
pretty
daughters
knew
that
she
desired
good
matches
for
them
educated
them
for
that
end
and
expected
them
to
do
their
parts
when
the
time
came
the
elder
sister
was
now
at
a
with
her
mother
and
carrie
hoped
that
a
letter
would
soon
come
telling
her
that
mary
was
settled
during
her
stay
with
warburton
she
had
learned
a
good
deal
and
was
unconsciously
contrasting
the
life
here
with
the
frivolous
one
at
home
made
up
of
public
show
and
private
sacrifice
of
comfort
dignity
and
peace
here
were
people
who
dressed
simply
enjoyed
conversation
kept
up
their
accomplishments
even
when
old
and
were
so
busy
lovable
and
charming
that
poor
carrie
often
felt
vulgar
ignorant
and
mortified
among
them
in
spite
of
their
fine
breeding
and
kindliness
the
society
warburton
drew
about
her
was
the
best
and
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
wise
and
simple
all
seemed
genuine
to
give
or
receive
enjoy
and
rest
and
then
go
out
to
their
work
refreshed
by
the
influences
of
the
place
and
the
sweet
old
lady
who
made
it
what
it
was
the
girls
would
soon
begin
life
for
themselves
and
it
was
well
that
they
had
this
little
glimpse
of
really
good
society
before
they
left
the
shelter
of
home
to
choose
friends
pleasures
and
pursuits
for
themselves
as
all
young
women
do
when
once
launched
the
sudden
silence
and
then
the
whispers
suggested
to
the
listener
that
she
had
perhaps
heard
something
not
meant
for
her
ears
so
she
presently
emerged
with
her
letters
and
said
as
she
came
smiling
toward
the
group
about
the
fire
how
are
you
getting
through
this
long
dull
afternoon
my
dears
quiet
as
mice
till
just
now
what
woke
you
up
a
battle
of
the
books
alice
looks
as
if
she
had
laid
in
plenty
of
ammunition
and
you
were
preparing
to
besiege
the
girls
laughed
and
all
rose
for
madam
warburton
was
a
stately
old
lady
and
people
involuntarily
treated
her
with
great
respect
even
in
this
mannerless
age
we
were
only
talking
about
books
began
carrie
deeply
grateful
that
wanda
was
safely
out
of
sight
and
we
could
agree
added
eva
running
to
ring
the
bell
for
the
man
to
take
the
letters
for
she
was
used
to
these
little
offices
at
home
and
loved
to
wait
on
madam
thanks
my
love
now
let
us
talk
a
little
if
you
are
tired
of
reading
and
if
you
like
to
let
me
share
the
discussion
comparing
tastes
in
literature
is
always
a
pleasure
and
i
used
to
enjoy
talking
over
books
with
my
girl
friends
more
than
anything
as
she
spoke
warburton
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
alice
rolled
up
drew
eva
to
the
cushion
at
her
feet
and
nodded
to
the
others
as
they
settled
again
with
interested
faces
one
at
the
table
where
the
pile
of
chosen
volumes
now
lay
the
other
erect
upon
the
couch
where
she
had
been
practising
the
poses
full
of
languid
grace
so
much
affected
by
her
favorite
heroines
carrie
was
laughing
at
me
for
liking
wise
books
and
wanting
to
improve
my
mind
is
it
foolish
and
a
waste
of
time
asked
alice
eager
to
convince
her
friend
and
secure
so
powerful
an
ally
no
my
dear
it
is
a
very
sensible
desire
and
i
wish
more
girls
had
it
only
do
be
greedy
and
read
too
much
cramming
and
smattering
is
as
bad
as
promiscuous
or
no
reading
at
all
choose
carefully
read
intelligently
and
digest
thoroughly
each
book
and
then
you
make
it
your
own
answered
warburton
quite
in
her
element
now
for
she
loved
to
give
advice
as
most
old
ladies
do
but
how
can
we
know
what
to
read
if
we
may
follow
our
tastes
said
carrie
trying
to
be
interested
and
intelligent
in
spite
of
her
fear
that
a
lecture
was
in
store
for
her
ask
advice
and
so
cultivate
a
true
and
refined
taste
i
always
judge
people
characters
a
good
deal
by
the
books
they
like
as
well
as
by
the
company
they
keep
so
one
should
be
careful
for
this
is
a
pretty
good
test
another
is
be
sure
that
whatever
will
not
bear
reading
aloud
is
not
fit
to
read
to
one
self
many
young
girls
ignorantly
or
curiously
take
up
books
quite
worthless
and
really
harmful
because
under
the
fine
writing
and
brilliant
color
lurks
immorality
or
the
false
sentiment
which
gives
wrong
ideas
of
life
and
things
which
should
be
sacred
they
think
perhaps
that
no
one
knows
this
taste
of
theirs
but
they
are
mistaken
for
it
shows
itself
in
many
ways
and
betrays
them
attitudes
looks
careless
words
and
a
morbid
or
foolishly
romantic
view
of
certain
things
show
plainly
that
the
maidenly
instincts
are
blunted
and
harm
done
that
perhaps
can
never
be
warburton
kept
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
tall
andirons
as
if
gravely
reproving
them
which
was
a
great
relief
to
carrie
whose
cheeks
glowed
as
she
stirred
uneasily
and
took
up
a
screen
as
if
to
guard
them
from
the
fire
but
conscience
pricked
her
sharply
and
memory
like
a
traitor
recalled
many
a
passage
or
scene
in
her
favorite
books
which
she
could
not
have
read
aloud
even
to
that
old
lady
though
she
enjoyed
them
in
private
nothing
very
bad
but
false
and
foolish
poor
food
for
a
lively
fancy
and
young
mind
to
feed
on
as
the
weariness
or
excitement
which
always
followed
plainly
proved
since
one
should
feel
refreshed
not
cloyed
with
an
intellectual
feast
alice
with
both
elbows
on
the
table
listened
with
eyes
and
eva
watched
the
raindrops
trickle
clown
the
pane
with
an
intent
expression
as
if
asking
herself
if
she
had
ever
done
this
naughty
thing
then
there
is
another
fault
continued
warburton
well
knowing
that
her
first
shot
had
hit
its
mark
and
anxious
to
be
just
some
lassies
have
a
mania
for
trying
to
read
everything
and
dip
into
works
far
beyond
their
powers
or
try
too
many
different
kinds
of
at
once
so
they
get
a
muddle
of
useless
things
into
their
heads
instead
of
ideas
and
real
knowledge
they
must
learn
to
wait
and
select
for
each
age
has
its
proper
class
of
books
and
what
is
greek
to
us
at
eighteen
may
be
just
what
we
need
at
thirty
one
can
get
mental
dyspepsia
on
meat
and
wine
as
well
as
on
and
frosted
cake
you
alice
smiled
and
pushed
away
four
of
the
eight
books
she
had
selected
as
if
afraid
she
had
been
greedy
and
now
felt
that
it
was
best
to
wait
a
little
eva
looked
up
with
some
anxiety
in
her
frank
eyes
as
she
said
now
it
is
my
turn
must
i
give
up
my
dear
homely
books
and
take
to
ruskin
kant
or
plato
warburton
laughed
as
she
stroked
the
pretty
brown
head
at
her
knee
not
yet
my
love
perhaps
never
for
those
are
not
the
masters
you
need
i
fancy
since
you
like
stories
about
people
try
some
of
the
fine
biographies
of
real
men
and
women
about
whom
you
should
know
something
you
will
find
their
lives
full
of
stirring
helpful
and
lovely
experiences
and
in
reading
of
these
you
will
get
courage
and
hope
and
faith
to
bear
your
own
trials
as
they
come
true
stories
suit
you
and
are
the
best
for
there
we
get
real
tragedy
and
comedy
and
the
lessons
all
must
thank
you
i
will
begin
at
once
if
you
will
kindly
give
me
a
list
of
such
as
would
be
good
for
me
cried
eva
with
the
sweet
docility
of
one
eager
to
be
all
that
is
lovable
and
wise
in
woman
give
us
a
list
and
we
will
try
to
improve
in
the
best
way
you
know
what
we
need
and
love
to
help
foolish
girls
or
you
be
so
kind
and
patient
with
us
said
alice
going
to
sit
beside
carrie
hoping
for
much
discussion
of
this
to
her
very
interesting
subject
i
will
with
pleasure
but
i
read
few
modern
novels
so
i
may
not
be
a
good
judge
there
most
of
them
seem
very
poor
stuff
and
i
can
not
waste
time
even
to
skim
them
as
some
people
do
i
still
like
the
ones
i
read
as
a
girl
though
you
would
laugh
at
them
did
any
of
you
ever
read
of
warsaw
i
have
and
thought
it
very
funny
so
were
and
i
wanted
to
try
smollett
and
fielding
after
reading
some
fine
essays
about
them
but
papa
told
me
i
must
wait
said
alice
ah
my
dears
in
my
day
thaddeus
was
our
hero
and
we
thought
the
scene
where
he
and
miss
beaufort
are
in
the
park
a
most
thrilling
one
two
fops
ask
thaddeus
where
he
got
his
boots
and
he
replies
with
withering
dignity
i
got
my
sword
gentlemen
i
treasured
the
picture
of
that
episode
for
a
long
time
thaddeus
wears
a
hat
as
full
of
black
plumes
as
a
hearse
hessian
boots
with
tassels
and
leans
over
mary
who
languishes
on
the
seat
in
a
gown
limp
scarf
poke
bonnet
and
large
bag
the
height
of
elegance
then
but
very
funny
now
then
william
wallace
in
chiefs
bless
me
we
cried
over
him
as
much
as
you
do
over
your
of
clifton
or
whatever
the
boy
name
is
you
would
get
through
it
i
fancy
and
as
for
poor
dear
prosy
richardson
his
heroines
would
bore
you
to
death
just
imagine
a
lover
saying
to
a
friend
begged
my
angel
to
stay
and
sip
one
dish
of
tea
she
sipped
one
dish
and
flew
now
i
sure
that
sillier
than
anything
the
duchess
ever
wrote
with
her
teas
and
flirtations
over
on
lawns
cried
carrie
as
they
all
laughed
at
the
immortal
lovelace
i
never
read
richardson
but
he
could
be
duller
than
henry
james
with
his
everlasting
stories
full
of
people
who
talk
a
great
deal
and
amount
to
nothing
like
the
older
novels
best
and
enjoy
some
of
scott
and
miss
edgeworth
better
than
howells
or
any
of
the
modern
realistic
writers
with
their
elevators
and
and
people
said
alice
who
wasted
little
time
on
light
literature
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
for
i
have
an
fancy
that
i
rather
read
about
people
as
they
were
for
that
is
history
or
as
they
might
and
should
be
for
that
helps
us
in
our
own
efforts
not
as
they
are
for
that
we
know
and
are
all
sufficiently
commonplace
ourselves
to
be
the
better
for
a
nobler
and
wider
view
of
life
and
men
than
any
we
are
apt
to
get
so
busy
are
we
earning
daily
bread
or
running
after
fortune
honor
or
some
other
bubble
but
i
must
lecture
or
i
shall
bore
you
and
forget
that
i
am
your
hostess
whose
duty
it
is
to
as
warburton
paused
carrie
anxious
to
change
the
subject
said
with
her
eyes
on
a
curious
jewel
which
the
old
lady
wore
i
also
like
true
stories
and
you
promised
to
tell
us
about
that
lovely
pin
some
day
this
is
just
the
time
for
it
please
with
pleasure
for
the
little
romance
is
quite
apropos
to
our
present
chat
it
is
a
very
simple
tale
and
rather
sad
but
it
had
a
great
influence
on
my
life
and
this
brooch
is
very
dear
to
as
warburton
sat
silent
a
moment
the
girls
all
looked
with
interest
at
the
quaint
pin
which
clasped
the
soft
folds
of
muslin
over
the
black
silk
dress
which
was
as
becoming
to
the
still
handsome
woman
as
the
cap
on
her
white
hair
and
the
winter
roses
in
her
cheeks
the
ornament
was
in
the
shape
of
a
pansy
its
purple
leaves
were
of
amethyst
the
yellow
of
topaz
and
in
the
middle
lay
a
diamond
drop
of
dew
several
letters
were
delicately
cut
on
its
golden
stem
and
a
guard
pin
showed
how
much
its
wearer
valued
it
my
sister
lucretia
was
a
good
deal
older
than
i
for
the
three
boys
came
between
began
warburton
still
gazing
at
the
fire
as
if
from
its
ashes
the
past
rose
up
bright
and
warm
again
she
was
a
very
lovely
and
superior
girl
and
i
looked
up
to
her
with
wonder
as
well
as
adoration
others
did
the
same
and
at
eighteen
she
was
engaged
to
a
charming
man
who
would
have
made
his
mark
had
he
lived
she
was
too
young
to
marry
then
and
frank
lyman
had
a
fine
opening
to
practise
his
profession
at
the
south
so
they
parted
for
two
years
and
it
was
then
that
he
gave
her
the
brooch
saying
to
her
as
she
whispered
how
lonely
she
should
be
without
him
pensee
is
a
happy
faithful
thought
of
me
wear
it
dearest
girl
and
do
pine
while
we
are
separated
read
and
study
write
much
to
me
and
remember
they
never
are
alone
that
are
accompanied
with
noble
was
that
sweet
cried
eva
pleased
with
the
beginning
of
the
tale
so
romantic
added
carrie
recalling
the
amber
amulet
one
of
her
pet
heroes
wore
for
years
and
died
kissing
after
he
had
killed
some
fifty
arabs
in
the
desert
did
she
read
and
study
asked
alice
with
a
soft
color
in
her
cheek
and
eager
eyes
for
a
budding
romance
was
folded
away
in
the
depths
of
her
maidenly
heart
and
she
liked
a
love
story
i
tell
you
what
she
did
for
it
was
rather
remarkable
at
that
day
when
girls
had
little
schooling
and
picked
up
accomplishments
as
they
could
the
first
winter
she
read
and
studied
at
home
and
wrote
much
to
lyman
i
have
their
letters
now
and
very
fine
ones
they
are
though
they
would
seem
to
you
young
things
curious
love
letters
full
of
advice
the
discussion
of
books
report
of
progress
glad
praise
modest
gratitude
happy
plans
and
a
faithful
affection
that
never
wavered
though
lucretia
was
beautiful
and
much
admired
and
the
dear
fellow
a
great
favorite
among
the
brilliant
southern
women
the
second
spring
lucretia
anxious
to
waste
no
time
and
ambitious
to
surprise
lyman
decided
to
go
and
study
with
old
gardener
at
portland
he
fitted
young
men
for
college
was
a
friend
of
our
father
and
had
a
daughter
who
was
a
very
wise
and
accomplished
woman
that
was
a
very
happy
summer
and
lu
got
on
so
well
that
she
begged
to
stay
all
winter
it
was
a
rare
chance
for
there
were
no
colleges
for
girls
then
and
very
few
advantages
to
be
had
and
the
dear
creature
burned
to
improve
every
faculty
that
she
might
be
more
worthy
of
her
lover
she
fitted
herself
for
college
with
the
youths
there
and
did
wonders
for
love
sharpened
her
wits
and
the
thought
of
that
happy
meeting
spurred
her
on
to
untiring
exertion
lyman
was
expected
in
may
and
the
wedding
was
to
be
in
june
but
alas
for
the
poor
girl
the
came
and
he
was
one
of
the
first
victims
they
never
met
again
and
nothing
was
left
her
of
all
that
happy
time
but
his
letters
his
library
and
the
warburton
paused
to
wipe
a
few
quiet
tears
from
her
eyes
while
the
girls
sat
in
sympathetic
silence
we
thought
it
would
kill
her
that
sudden
change
from
love
hope
and
happiness
to
sorrow
death
and
solitude
but
hearts
break
my
dears
if
they
know
where
to
go
for
strength
lucretia
did
and
after
the
first
shock
was
over
found
comfort
in
her
books
saying
with
a
brave
bright
look
and
the
sweetest
resignation
must
go
on
trying
to
be
more
worthy
of
him
for
we
shall
meet
again
in
god
good
time
and
he
shall
see
that
i
do
not
forget
that
was
better
than
tears
and
lamentation
and
the
long
years
that
followed
were
beautiful
and
busy
ones
full
of
dutiful
care
for
us
at
home
after
our
mother
died
of
interest
in
all
the
good
works
of
her
time
and
a
steady
quiet
effort
to
improve
every
faculty
of
her
fine
mind
till
she
was
felt
to
be
one
of
the
noblest
women
in
our
city
her
influence
was
all
the
intelligent
people
sought
her
and
when
she
travelled
she
was
welcome
everywhere
for
cultivated
persons
have
a
of
their
own
and
are
recognized
at
did
she
ever
marry
asked
carrie
feeling
that
no
life
could
be
quite
successful
without
that
great
event
never
she
felt
herself
a
widow
and
wore
black
to
the
day
of
her
death
many
men
asked
her
hand
but
she
refused
them
all
and
was
the
sweetest
maid
ever
seen
cheerful
and
serene
to
the
very
last
for
she
was
ill
a
long
time
and
found
her
solace
and
stay
still
in
the
beloved
books
even
when
she
could
no
longer
read
them
her
memory
supplied
her
with
the
mental
food
that
kept
her
soul
strong
while
her
body
failed
it
was
wonderful
to
see
and
hear
her
repeating
fine
lines
heroic
sayings
and
comforting
psalms
through
the
weary
nights
when
no
sleep
would
come
making
friends
and
helpers
of
the
poets
philosophers
and
saints
whom
she
knew
and
loved
so
well
it
made
death
beautiful
and
taught
me
how
victorious
an
immortal
soul
can
be
over
the
ills
that
vex
our
mortal
flesh
she
died
at
dawn
on
easter
sunday
after
a
quiet
night
when
she
had
given
me
her
little
legacy
of
letters
books
and
the
one
jewel
she
had
always
worn
repeating
her
lover
words
to
comfort
me
i
had
read
the
commendatory
prayer
and
as
i
finished
she
whispered
with
a
look
of
perfect
peace
the
book
dear
i
need
study
no
more
i
have
hoped
and
believed
now
i
shall
know
and
so
went
happily
away
to
meet
her
lover
after
patient
the
sigh
of
the
wind
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
till
the
quiet
voice
went
on
again
as
if
it
loved
to
tell
the
story
for
the
thought
of
soon
seeing
the
beloved
sister
took
the
sadness
from
the
memory
of
the
past
i
also
found
my
solace
in
books
for
i
was
very
lonely
when
she
was
gone
my
father
being
dead
the
brothers
married
and
home
desolate
i
took
to
study
and
reading
as
a
congenial
employment
feeling
no
inclination
to
marry
and
for
many
years
was
quite
contented
among
my
books
but
in
trying
to
follow
in
dear
lucretia
footsteps
i
unconsciously
fitted
myself
for
the
great
honor
and
happiness
of
my
life
and
curiously
enough
i
owed
it
to
a
warburton
smiled
as
she
took
up
a
shabby
little
volume
from
the
table
where
alice
had
laid
it
and
quick
to
divine
another
romance
eva
said
like
a
child
do
tell
about
it
the
other
was
so
this
begins
merrily
and
has
a
wedding
in
it
as
young
girls
think
all
tales
should
well
when
i
was
about
i
was
invited
to
join
a
party
of
friends
on
a
trip
to
canada
that
being
the
favorite
jaunt
in
my
young
days
i
been
studying
hard
for
some
years
and
needed
rest
so
i
was
glad
to
go
as
a
good
book
for
an
excursion
i
took
this
wordsworth
in
my
bag
it
is
full
of
fine
passages
you
know
and
i
loved
it
for
it
was
one
of
the
books
given
to
lucretia
by
her
lover
we
had
a
charming
time
and
were
on
our
way
to
quebec
when
my
little
adventure
happened
i
was
in
raptures
over
the
grand
lawrence
as
we
steamed
slowly
from
montreal
that
lovely
summer
day
i
could
not
read
but
sat
on
the
upper
deck
feasting
my
eyes
and
dreaming
dreams
as
even
staid
maiden
ladies
will
when
out
on
a
holiday
suddenly
i
caught
the
sound
of
voices
in
earnest
discussion
on
the
lower
deck
and
glancing
down
saw
several
gentlemen
leaning
against
the
rail
as
they
talked
over
certain
events
of
great
public
interest
at
that
moment
i
knew
that
a
party
of
distinguished
persons
were
on
board
as
my
friend
husband
tracy
knew
some
of
them
and
pointed
out
warburton
as
one
of
the
rising
scientific
men
of
the
day
i
remembered
that
my
sister
had
met
him
years
ago
and
much
admired
him
both
for
his
own
gifts
and
because
he
had
known
lyman
as
other
people
were
listening
i
felt
no
delicacy
about
doing
the
same
for
the
conversation
was
an
eloquent
one
and
well
worth
catching
so
interested
did
i
become
that
i
forgot
the
great
rafts
floating
by
the
picturesque
shores
the
splendid
river
and
leaned
nearer
and
nearer
that
no
word
might
be
lost
till
my
book
slid
out
of
my
lap
and
fell
straight
down
upon
the
head
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
giving
him
a
smart
blow
and
knocking
his
hat
oh
what
did
you
do
cried
the
girls
much
amused
at
this
unromantic
catastrophe
warburton
clasped
her
hands
dramatically
as
her
eyes
twinkled
and
a
pretty
color
came
into
her
cheeks
at
the
memory
of
that
exciting
moment
my
dears
i
could
have
dropped
with
mortification
what
could
i
do
but
dodge
and
peep
as
i
waited
to
see
the
end
of
this
most
untoward
accident
fortunately
i
was
alone
on
that
side
of
the
deck
so
none
of
the
ladies
saw
my
mishap
and
slipping
along
the
seat
to
a
distant
corner
i
hid
my
face
behind
a
convenient
newspaper
as
i
watched
the
little
flurry
of
fishing
up
the
hat
by
a
man
in
a
boat
near
by
and
the
merriment
of
the
gentlemen
over
this
assault
of
william
wordsworth
upon
samuel
warburton
the
poor
book
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
many
jokes
were
made
upon
the
helen
whose
name
was
written
on
the
paper
cover
which
projected
it
knew
a
miss
harper
once
a
lovely
woman
but
her
name
was
not
helen
and
she
is
dead
god
bless
her
i
heard
warburton
say
as
he
flapped
his
straw
hat
to
dry
it
and
rubbed
his
head
which
fortunately
was
well
covered
with
thick
gray
hair
at
that
time
i
longed
to
go
down
and
tell
him
who
i
was
but
i
had
not
the
courage
to
face
all
those
men
it
really
was
most
embarrassing
so
i
waited
for
a
more
private
moment
to
claim
my
book
as
i
knew
we
should
not
land
till
night
so
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
it
is
rather
unusual
stuff
for
a
woman
to
be
reading
some
literary
lady
doubtless
better
look
her
up
warburton
you
know
her
by
the
color
of
her
stockings
when
she
comes
down
to
lunch
said
a
jolly
old
gentlenoan
in
a
tone
that
made
me
high
as
evelina
says
shall
know
her
by
her
intelligent
face
and
conversation
if
this
book
belongs
to
a
lady
it
will
be
an
honor
and
a
pleasure
to
meet
a
woman
who
enjoys
wordsworth
for
in
my
opinion
he
is
one
of
our
truest
poets
answered
warburton
putting
the
book
in
his
pocket
with
a
look
and
a
tone
that
were
most
respectful
and
comforting
to
me
just
then
i
hoped
he
would
examine
the
volume
for
lucretia
and
names
were
on
the
fly
leaf
and
that
would
be
a
delightful
introduction
for
me
so
i
said
nothing
and
bided
my
time
feeling
rather
foolish
when
we
all
filed
in
to
lunch
and
i
saw
the
other
party
glancing
at
the
ladies
at
the
table
warburton
eye
paused
a
moment
as
it
passed
from
tracy
to
me
and
i
fear
i
blushed
like
a
girl
my
dears
for
samuel
had
very
fine
eyes
and
i
remembered
the
stout
gentleman
unseemly
joke
about
the
stockings
mine
were
white
as
snow
for
i
had
a
neat
foot
and
was
fond
of
nice
hose
and
shoes
i
am
so
still
as
you
here
the
old
lady
displayed
a
small
foot
in
a
black
silk
stocking
and
delicate
slipper
with
the
artless
pride
a
woman
feels
at
any
age
in
one
of
her
best
points
the
girls
gratified
her
by
a
murmur
of
admiration
and
decorously
readjusting
the
folds
of
her
gown
she
went
on
with
the
most
romantic
episode
of
her
quiet
life
i
retired
to
my
after
lunch
to
compose
myself
and
when
i
emerged
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
my
first
glance
showed
me
that
the
hour
had
come
for
there
on
deck
was
warburton
talking
to
tracy
with
my
book
in
his
hand
i
hesitated
a
moment
for
in
spite
of
my
age
i
was
rather
shy
and
really
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
apologize
to
a
strange
for
dropping
books
on
his
head
and
spoiling
his
hat
men
think
so
much
of
their
hats
you
know
i
was
spared
embarrassment
however
for
he
saw
me
and
came
to
me
at
once
saying
in
the
most
cordial
manner
as
he
showed
the
names
on
the
fly
leaf
of
my
wordsworth
am
sure
we
need
no
other
introduction
but
the
names
of
these
two
dear
friends
of
ours
i
am
very
glad
to
find
that
miss
helen
harper
is
the
little
girl
i
saw
once
or
twice
at
your
father
house
some
years
ago
and
to
meet
her
so
pleasantly
again
that
made
everything
easy
and
delightful
and
when
i
had
apologized
and
been
laughingly
assured
that
he
considered
it
rather
an
honor
than
otherwise
to
be
assaulted
by
so
great
a
man
we
fell
to
talking
of
old
times
and
soon
forgot
that
we
were
strangers
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
i
but
a
handsome
man
and
a
most
interesting
and
excellent
one
as
we
all
know
he
had
lost
a
young
wife
long
ago
and
had
lived
for
science
ever
since
but
it
had
not
made
him
dry
or
cold
or
selfish
he
was
very
young
at
heart
for
all
his
wisdom
and
enjoyed
that
holiday
like
a
boy
out
of
school
so
did
i
and
never
dreamed
that
anything
would
come
of
it
but
a
pleasant
friendship
founded
on
our
love
for
those
now
dead
and
gone
dear
me
how
strangely
things
turn
out
in
this
world
of
ours
and
how
the
dropping
of
that
book
changed
my
life
well
that
was
our
introduction
and
that
first
long
conversation
was
followed
by
many
more
equally
charming
during
the
three
weeks
our
parties
were
much
together
as
both
were
taking
the
same
trip
and
tracy
was
glad
to
meet
his
old
friend
i
need
not
tell
you
how
delightful
such
society
was
to
me
nor
how
surprised
i
was
when
on
the
last
day
before
we
parted
warburton
who
had
answered
many
questions
of
mine
during
these
long
chats
of
ours
asked
me
a
very
serious
one
and
i
found
that
i
could
answer
it
as
he
wished
it
brought
me
great
honor
as
well
as
happiness
i
fear
i
was
not
worthy
of
it
but
i
tried
to
be
and
felt
a
tender
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
i
owed
it
to
dear
lucretia
in
part
at
least
for
my
effort
to
imitate
her
made
me
fitter
to
become
a
wise
man
wife
and
thirty
years
of
very
sweet
companionship
was
my
as
she
spoke
warburton
bowed
her
head
before
the
portrait
of
a
venerable
old
man
which
hung
above
the
it
was
a
pretty
expression
of
wifely
pride
and
womanly
tenderness
in
the
fine
old
lady
who
forgot
her
own
gifts
and
felt
only
humility
and
gratitude
to
the
man
who
had
found
in
her
a
comrade
in
intellectual
pursuits
as
well
as
a
helpmeet
at
home
and
a
gentle
prop
for
his
declining
years
the
girls
looked
up
with
eyes
full
of
something
softer
than
mere
curiosity
and
felt
in
their
young
hearts
how
precious
and
honorable
such
a
memory
must
be
how
true
and
beautiful
such
a
marriage
was
and
how
sweet
wisdom
might
become
when
it
went
hand
in
hand
with
love
alice
spoke
first
saying
as
she
touched
the
worn
cover
of
the
little
book
with
a
new
sort
of
respect
thank
you
very
much
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
this
from
the
corner
shelves
in
your
sanctum
i
wanted
to
find
the
rest
of
the
lines
thornton
quoted
last
night
and
did
stop
to
ask
you
are
welcome
my
love
for
you
know
how
to
treat
books
yes
those
in
that
little
case
are
my
precious
relics
i
keep
them
all
from
my
childish
to
my
bible
for
by
and
by
when
i
sit
towards
sunset
as
dear
lydia
maria
child
calls
our
last
days
i
shall
lose
my
interest
in
other
books
and
take
comfort
in
these
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
life
we
are
all
children
again
and
love
the
songs
our
mothers
sung
us
and
find
the
one
true
book
our
best
teacher
as
we
draw
near
to
as
the
reverent
voice
paused
a
ray
of
sunshine
broke
through
the
parting
clouds
and
shone
full
on
the
serene
old
face
turned
to
meet
it
with
a
smile
that
welcomed
the
herald
of
a
lovely
sunset
the
rain
is
over
there
will
be
just
time
for
a
run
in
the
garden
before
dinner
girls
i
must
go
and
change
my
cap
for
literary
ladies
should
not
neglect
to
look
well
after
the
ways
of
their
household
and
keep
themseves
tidy
no
matter
how
old
they
may
and
with
a
nod
warburton
left
them
wondering
what
the
effect
of
the
conversation
would
be
on
the
minds
of
her
young
guests
alice
went
away
to
the
garden
thinking
of
lucretia
and
her
lover
as
she
gathered
flowers
in
the
sunshine
conscientious
eva
took
the
life
of
mary
somerville
to
her
room
and
read
diligently
for
half
an
hour
that
no
time
might
be
lost
in
her
new
course
of
study
carrie
sent
wanda
and
her
finery
up
the
chimney
in
a
lively
blaze
and
as
she
watched
the
book
burn
decided
to
take
her
blue
and
gold
volume
of
tennyson
with
her
on
her
next
trip
to
nahant
in
case
any
eligible
learned
or
literary
man
head
should
offer
itself
as
a
shining
mark
since
a
good
marriage
was
the
end
of
life
why
not
follow
warburton
example
and
make
a
really
excellent
one
when
they
all
met
at
the
old
lady
was
pleased
to
see
a
nosegay
of
fresh
pansies
in
the
bosoms
of
her
three
youngest
guests
and
to
hear
alice
whisper
with
grateful
eyes
we
wear
your
flower
to
show
you
that
we
do
mean
to
forget
the
lesson
you
so
kindly
gave
us
and
to
fortify
ourselves
with
thoughts
as
you
and
she
a
party
of
people
young
and
old
sat
on
the
piazza
of
a
seaside
hotel
one
summer
morning
discussing
plans
for
the
day
as
they
waited
for
the
mail
hullo
here
comes
christie
johnstone
exclaimed
one
of
the
young
men
perched
on
the
railing
who
was
poisoning
the
fresh
air
with
the
sickly
scent
of
a
cigarette
so
is
with
the
baddish
boy
in
tow
as
large
as
life
added
another
with
a
pleasant
laugh
as
he
turned
to
look
the
certainly
looked
somewhat
like
charles
picturesque
pair
and
every
one
watched
them
with
idle
interest
as
they
drew
nearer
a
tall
robust
girl
of
seventeen
with
dark
eyes
and
hair
a
fine
color
on
her
brown
cheek
and
vigor
in
every
movement
came
up
the
rocky
path
from
the
beach
with
a
basket
of
lobsters
on
one
arm
of
fish
on
the
other
and
a
wicker
tray
of
on
her
head
the
scarlet
and
silver
of
the
fish
contrasted
prettily
with
the
dark
blue
of
her
rough
dress
and
the
pile
of
water
flowers
made
a
fitting
crown
for
this
bonny
young
a
sturdy
lad
of
twelve
came
lurching
after
her
in
a
pair
of
very
large
rubber
boots
with
a
dilapidated
straw
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
pail
on
either
arm
straight
on
went
the
girl
never
turning
head
or
eyes
as
she
passed
the
group
on
the
piazza
and
vanished
round
the
corner
though
it
was
evident
that
she
heard
the
laugh
the
last
speech
produced
for
the
color
deepened
in
her
cheeks
and
her
step
quickened
the
boy
however
returned
the
glances
bent
upon
him
and
answered
the
smiles
with
such
a
cheerful
grin
that
the
youth
with
the
cigarette
called
out
skipper
where
do
you
hail
from
island
yender
answered
the
boy
with
a
gesture
of
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
oh
you
are
the
are
you
no
i
ai
me
and
gramper
fishermen
your
name
is
flucker
johnstone
and
your
sister
christie
i
think
added
the
youth
enjoying
the
amusement
of
the
young
ladies
about
him
it
sammy
bowen
and
hern
have
you
got
a
boaz
over
there
for
her
no
we
got
a
a
real
this
unexpected
reply
produced
a
roar
from
the
gentlemen
while
the
boy
grinned
though
without
the
least
idea
what
the
joke
was
pretty
miss
ellery
who
had
been
told
that
she
had
a
rippling
laugh
rippled
sweetly
as
she
leaned
over
the
railing
to
ask
are
those
lilies
in
your
pails
i
want
some
if
they
are
for
sister
fetch
round
when
she
left
the
lobs
i
ai
got
none
this
is
bait
for
them
and
as
if
reminded
of
business
by
the
yells
of
several
boys
who
had
just
caught
sight
of
him
sammy
abruptly
weighed
anchor
and
ran
before
the
wind
toward
the
stable
funny
lot
these
natives
act
as
if
they
owned
the
place
and
are
as
stupid
as
their
own
fish
said
the
youth
in
the
white
yachting
suit
as
he
flung
away
his
cigarette
end
do
agree
with
you
fred
i
known
people
of
this
sort
all
my
life
and
a
finer
set
of
honest
hardworking
independent
men
i
never
met
brave
as
lions
and
tender
as
women
in
spite
of
their
rough
ways
answered
the
other
young
man
who
wore
blue
flannel
and
had
a
gold
band
on
his
cap
sailors
and
soldiers
always
stand
by
one
another
so
of
course
you
see
the
best
side
of
these
fellows
captain
the
girls
are
fine
creatures
i
grant
you
but
their
good
looks
do
last
long
the
pity
few
women
would
with
the
life
they
lead
so
full
of
hard
work
suspense
and
sorrow
no
one
knows
till
one
is
tried
how
much
courage
and
faith
it
takes
to
keep
young
and
happy
when
the
men
one
loves
are
on
the
great
sea
said
a
quiet
lady
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
knee
of
the
young
man
in
blue
with
a
look
that
made
him
smile
affectionately
at
her
with
his
own
brown
hand
on
hers
should
wonder
if
ben
bowen
was
laid
up
since
the
girl
brings
the
fish
he
a
fine
old
fellow
i
been
to
no
man
land
many
a
time
with
him
must
ask
after
him
said
an
elderly
gentleman
who
was
pacing
to
and
fro
yearning
for
the
morning
papers
we
might
go
over
to
the
island
and
have
a
or
a
some
moonlight
night
i
have
been
here
for
several
years
but
it
used
to
be
great
fun
and
i
suppose
we
can
do
it
now
suggested
miss
ellery
with
the
laugh
by
jove
we
will
and
look
up
christie
ask
her
when
she
comes
round
said
fred
the
youthful
dude
untwining
his
languid
legs
as
if
the
prospect
put
a
little
life
into
him
of
course
we
pay
for
any
trouble
we
give
these
people
will
do
anything
for
money
began
miss
ellery
but
captain
john
as
they
called
the
sailor
held
up
his
hand
with
a
warning
hush
coming
as
ruth
brown
hat
turned
the
corner
she
paused
a
moment
to
drop
the
empty
baskets
shake
her
skirts
and
put
up
a
black
braid
that
had
fallen
down
then
with
the
air
of
one
resolved
to
do
a
distasteful
task
as
quickly
as
possible
she
came
up
the
steps
held
out
the
rough
basket
cover
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
would
any
of
the
ladies
like
some
fresh
lilies
ten
cents
a
a
murmur
from
the
ladies
expressed
their
admiration
of
the
beautiful
flowers
and
the
gentlemen
pressed
forward
to
buy
and
present
every
bunch
with
gallant
haste
ruth
eyes
shone
as
the
money
fell
into
her
hand
and
several
voices
begged
her
to
bring
more
lilies
while
they
lasted
i
did
know
the
darlings
would
grow
in
salt
water
said
miss
ellery
as
she
fondly
gazed
upon
the
cluster
fred
had
just
offered
her
they
do
there
a
little
pond
on
our
island
and
they
grow
there
only
place
for
miles
round
and
ruth
looked
at
the
delicate
girl
in
ruffled
white
lawn
and
a
mull
hat
with
a
glance
of
mingled
pity
for
her
ignorance
and
admiration
for
her
beauty
how
silly
of
me
i
am
such
a
goose
and
miss
ellery
gurgled
as
she
hid
her
face
behind
her
red
parasol
ask
about
the
whispered
fred
putting
his
head
behind
the
rosy
screen
to
assure
the
pretty
creature
that
he
know
any
better
himself
oh
yes
i
will
and
quite
consoled
miss
ellery
called
out
girl
will
you
tell
me
if
we
can
have
on
your
rocks
as
we
used
to
a
few
seasons
ago
if
you
bring
your
own
fish
grandpa
is
sick
and
ca
get
for
we
will
provide
them
but
who
will
cook
them
for
us
it
such
horrid
any
one
can
fry
fish
i
will
if
you
want
me
to
and
ruth
half
smiled
remembering
that
this
girl
who
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
pork
and
a
hot
used
to
eat
as
heartily
as
any
one
when
the
crisp
brown
cunners
were
served
up
very
good
then
we
engage
you
as
cook
and
come
over
if
it
clear
and
our
fishing
prospers
do
forget
a
dozen
of
the
finest
lilies
for
this
lady
morning
pay
you
now
may
not
be
up
and
fred
dropped
a
bright
silver
dollar
into
the
basket
with
a
patronizing
air
intended
to
impress
this
rather
too
independent
young
person
with
a
proper
sense
of
inferiority
ruth
quietly
shook
the
money
out
upon
the
and
said
with
a
sudden
sparkle
in
her
black
eyes
it
doubtful
if
i
bring
any
more
better
wait
till
i
i
sorry
your
grandfather
is
sick
i
come
over
and
see
him
and
bring
the
papers
if
he
would
like
some
said
the
elderly
gentleman
as
he
came
up
with
a
friendly
nod
and
real
interest
in
his
face
very
much
thank
you
sir
he
is
very
feeble
now
and
ruth
turned
with
a
bright
smile
to
welcome
kind
wallace
who
had
not
forgotten
the
old
man
christie
has
got
a
nice
little
temper
of
her
own
and
do
know
how
to
treat
a
fellow
when
he
wants
to
do
her
a
favor
growled
fred
pocketing
his
dollar
with
a
disgusted
air
she
appears
to
know
how
to
treat
a
gentleman
when
he
offers
one
answered
blue
jacket
with
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
other
discomfiture
girls
of
that
class
always
put
on
airs
if
they
are
the
least
bit
pretty
so
absurd
said
miss
ellery
pulling
up
her
long
gloves
as
she
glanced
at
the
brown
arms
of
the
fisher
maiden
girls
of
any
class
like
to
be
treated
with
respect
modesty
in
is
as
sweet
as
in
muslin
my
dear
and
should
be
even
more
admired
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
said
the
lady
hear
hear
murmured
her
sailor
nephew
with
an
approving
nod
it
was
evident
that
ruth
had
heard
also
as
she
turned
to
go
for
with
a
quick
gesture
she
pulled
three
great
lilies
from
her
hat
and
laid
them
on
the
old
lady
lap
saying
with
a
grateful
look
thank
you
she
had
seen
miss
scott
hand
her
bunch
to
a
meek
little
governess
who
had
been
forgotten
and
this
was
all
she
had
to
offer
in
return
for
the
kindness
which
is
so
sweet
to
poor
girls
whose
sensitive
pride
gets
often
wounded
by
trifles
like
these
she
was
going
without
her
baskets
when
captain
john
swung
himself
over
the
railing
and
ran
after
her
with
them
he
touched
his
cap
as
he
met
her
and
was
thanked
with
as
bright
a
smile
as
that
the
elder
gentleman
had
received
for
his
respectful
miss
bowen
pleased
her
much
after
the
rude
girl
and
the
money
tossed
to
her
as
if
she
were
a
beggar
when
he
came
back
the
mail
had
arrived
and
all
scattered
at
once
fred
to
spend
the
dollar
in
more
cigarettes
and
captain
john
to
settle
carefully
in
his
the
aunt
mary
gave
him
before
both
young
men
went
off
to
play
tennis
as
if
their
bread
depended
on
it
as
it
bid
fair
to
be
a
moonlight
night
the
party
of
a
dozen
young
people
with
miss
scott
and
wallace
to
act
as
matron
and
admiral
of
the
fleet
set
off
to
the
island
about
sunset
fish
in
abundance
had
been
caught
and
a
picnic
supper
provided
to
be
eaten
on
the
rocks
when
the
proper
time
arrived
they
found
sammy
in
a
clean
blue
shirt
and
a
hat
less
like
a
feejee
headpiece
willing
to
do
the
honors
of
the
island
beaming
like
a
freckled
young
merman
as
he
paddled
out
to
pull
up
the
boats
fire
all
ready
for
kindlin
and
ruth
slicin
the
pertaters
hope
them
fish
is
cleaned
he
added
with
a
face
of
deep
anxiety
for
that
weary
task
would
fall
to
him
if
not
already
done
and
the
thought
desolated
his
boyish
soul
all
ready
sam
lend
a
hand
with
these
baskets
and
then
steer
for
the
lighthouse
the
ladies
want
to
see
that
first
answered
captain
john
as
he
tossed
a
stray
cookie
into
sammy
mouth
with
a
smile
that
caused
that
youth
to
cleave
to
him
like
a
burr
all
the
evening
the
young
people
scattered
over
the
rocks
and
hastened
to
visit
the
points
of
interest
before
dark
they
climbed
the
lighthouse
tower
and
paid
aunt
nabby
and
grandpa
a
call
at
the
little
house
where
the
old
woman
lent
them
a
mammoth
and
promised
that
ruth
would
dish
up
them
fish
in
good
shape
at
eight
then
they
strolled
away
to
see
the
pond
where
the
lilies
grew
how
curious
that
such
a
thing
should
be
here
right
in
the
middle
of
the
salt
sea
said
one
of
the
girls
as
they
stood
looking
at
the
quiet
pool
while
the
tide
dashed
high
upon
the
rocks
all
about
them
not
more
curious
than
how
it
is
possible
for
anything
so
beautiful
and
pure
as
one
of
those
lilies
to
grow
from
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
the
ugly
yellow
ones
are
not
so
out
of
place
but
no
one
cares
for
them
and
they
smell
horridly
added
another
girl
in
a
reflective
tone
instinct
sends
the
white
lily
straight
up
to
the
sun
and
air
and
the
strong
slender
stem
anchors
it
to
the
rich
earth
below
out
of
which
it
has
power
to
draw
the
nourishment
that
makes
it
so
lovely
and
keeps
it
spotless
unless
slugs
and
flies
and
boys
spoil
it
added
miss
scott
as
she
watched
fred
poke
and
splash
with
his
cane
after
a
flower
the
naughty
things
have
all
shut
up
and
spoilt
the
pretty
sight
i
so
disappointed
sighed
miss
ellery
surveying
the
green
buds
with
great
disfavor
as
she
had
planned
to
wear
some
in
her
hair
and
act
undine
you
must
come
early
in
the
morning
if
you
want
to
see
them
at
their
best
i
read
somewhere
that
when
the
sun
first
strikes
them
they
open
rapidly
and
it
is
a
lovely
sight
i
shall
try
to
see
it
some
day
if
i
can
get
here
in
time
said
miss
scott
how
romantic
old
maids
are
whispered
one
girl
to
another
so
are
young
ones
hear
what
floss
ellery
is
saying
answered
the
other
and
both
giggled
under
their
big
hats
as
they
caught
these
words
followed
by
the
rippling
laugh
all
flowers
open
and
show
their
hearts
when
the
sun
shines
on
them
at
the
right
i
wish
human
flowers
would
murmured
fred
and
then
as
if
rather
alarmed
at
his
own
remark
he
added
hastily
i
get
that
big
lily
out
there
and
make
it
bloom
for
trusting
to
an
old
log
that
lay
in
the
pond
he
went
to
the
end
and
bent
to
pull
in
the
flower
but
this
too
ardent
sun
was
not
to
make
it
blossom
for
his
foot
slipped
and
down
he
went
up
to
his
knees
in
mud
and
water
save
him
oh
save
him
shrieked
miss
ellery
clutching
captain
john
who
was
laughing
like
a
boy
while
the
other
lads
shouted
and
the
girls
added
their
shrill
merriment
as
poor
fred
scrambled
to
the
shore
a
wreck
of
the
gallant
craft
that
had
set
sail
in
spotless
white
what
the
deuce
shall
i
do
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
despair
as
they
flocked
about
him
to
condole
even
while
they
laughed
roll
up
your
trousers
and
borrow
sam
boots
the
old
lady
will
dry
your
shoes
and
socks
while
you
are
at
supper
and
have
them
ready
to
wear
home
suggested
captain
john
who
was
used
to
duckings
and
made
light
of
them
the
word
supper
made
one
youth
sniff
the
air
and
announce
that
he
smelt
something
good
and
at
once
every
one
turned
toward
the
picnic
ground
like
chickens
hurrying
to
the
barn
at
fred
vanished
into
the
cottage
and
the
rest
gathered
about
the
great
fire
of
driftwood
fast
turning
to
clear
coals
over
which
ruth
was
beginning
her
long
hot
task
she
wore
a
big
apron
a
red
handkerchief
over
her
head
had
her
sleeves
rolled
up
and
was
so
intent
on
her
work
that
she
merely
nodded
and
smiled
as
the
greeted
her
with
varying
degrees
of
courtesy
she
looks
like
a
handsome
gypsy
with
her
dark
face
and
that
red
thing
in
the
firelight
i
wish
i
could
paint
her
said
miss
scott
who
was
very
young
at
heart
in
spite
of
her
fifty
years
and
gray
head
so
do
i
but
we
can
remember
it
i
do
like
to
see
a
girl
work
with
a
will
even
at
frying
fish
most
of
dawdle
so
at
the
few
things
they
try
to
do
there
a
piece
of
energy
for
you
and
captain
john
leaned
forward
from
his
rocky
seat
to
watch
ruth
who
just
then
caught
up
the
about
to
boil
over
and
with
the
other
hand
saved
her
from
capsizing
on
its
unsteady
bed
of
coals
she
is
a
nice
girl
and
i
much
interested
in
her
wallace
says
he
will
tell
us
her
story
if
we
care
to
hear
it
he
has
known
the
old
man
a
long
do
forget
to
remind
him
aunty
i
like
a
yarn
after
mess
and
captain
john
went
off
to
bring
the
first
plate
of
fish
to
the
dear
old
lady
who
had
been
a
mother
to
him
for
many
years
it
was
a
merry
supper
and
the
moon
was
up
before
it
ended
for
everything
tasted
so
good
the
hearty
young
appetites
sharpened
by
sea
air
were
hard
to
satisfy
when
the
last
cunner
had
vanished
and
nothing
but
olives
and
oyster
crackers
remained
the
party
settled
on
a
sloping
rock
out
of
range
of
the
fire
and
reposed
for
a
brief
period
to
recover
from
the
exertions
of
the
feast
having
like
the
heroes
in
the
old
story
eaten
mightily
for
the
space
of
an
fred
in
the
capacious
boots
was
a
source
of
amusement
and
consequently
somewhat
subdued
but
miss
ellery
consoled
him
and
much
food
sustained
him
till
his
shoes
were
dry
ruth
remained
to
clear
up
and
sammy
to
gorge
himself
on
the
remnants
of
sweet
cake
which
he
could
not
bear
to
see
wasted
so
when
some
one
proposed
telling
stories
till
they
were
ready
to
sing
wallace
was
begged
to
begin
it
is
only
something
about
this
island
but
you
may
like
to
hear
it
just
now
said
the
genial
old
gentleman
settling
his
handkerchief
over
his
bald
head
for
fear
of
cold
and
glancing
at
the
attentive
young
faces
grouped
about
him
in
the
moonlight
some
twenty
years
ago
there
was
a
wreck
over
there
on
those
great
rocks
you
fellows
have
heard
about
it
so
i
only
say
that
a
very
brave
sailor
a
native
of
the
port
here
swam
out
with
a
rope
and
saved
a
dozen
men
and
women
i
call
him
sam
well
one
of
the
women
was
an
english
governess
and
when
the
lady
she
was
with
went
on
her
way
after
the
wreck
this
pretty
girl
who
by
the
way
was
a
good
deal
hurt
trying
to
save
the
child
she
had
in
charge
was
left
behind
to
recover
and
marry
the
brave
sailor
of
course
cried
one
of
the
girls
exactly
and
a
very
happy
pair
they
were
she
had
no
family
who
wanted
her
at
home
her
father
had
been
a
clergyman
i
believe
and
she
was
well
born
but
sam
was
a
fine
fellow
and
earned
his
living
honestly
fishing
off
the
banks
as
half
the
men
do
here
well
they
were
very
happy
had
two
children
and
were
saving
up
a
bit
when
poor
sam
and
two
brothers
were
lost
in
one
of
the
great
storms
which
now
and
then
make
widows
and
orphans
by
the
dozen
it
killed
the
wife
but
sam
father
who
kept
the
lighthouse
here
then
took
the
poor
children
and
supported
them
for
ten
years
the
boy
was
a
mere
baby
the
girl
a
fine
creature
brave
like
her
father
handsome
like
her
mother
and
with
a
good
deal
of
the
lady
about
her
though
every
one
did
find
it
ahem
cried
the
sharp
girl
who
began
to
understand
the
point
of
the
story
now
but
would
not
spoil
it
as
the
others
seemed
still
in
the
dark
though
miss
scott
was
smiling
and
captain
john
staring
hard
at
the
old
gentleman
in
the
blue
silk
nightcap
got
a
fly
in
your
throat
asked
a
neighbor
but
kate
only
laughed
and
begged
pardon
for
interrupting
there
not
much
more
only
that
affair
was
rather
romantic
and
one
ca
help
wondering
how
the
children
turned
out
storms
seem
to
have
been
their
doom
for
in
the
terrible
one
we
had
two
winters
ago
the
old
lighthouse
keeper
had
a
bad
fall
on
the
icy
rocks
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
girl
the
light
would
have
gone
out
and
more
ships
been
lost
on
this
dangerous
point
the
keeper
mate
had
gone
ashore
and
could
get
back
for
two
days
the
gale
raged
so
fiercely
but
he
knew
ben
could
get
on
without
him
as
he
had
the
girl
and
boy
over
for
a
visit
in
winter
they
lived
with
a
friend
and
went
to
school
at
the
port
it
would
have
been
all
right
if
ben
had
broken
his
ribs
but
he
was
a
stout
old
salt
so
he
told
the
girl
what
to
do
and
she
did
it
while
the
boy
waited
on
the
sick
man
for
two
days
and
nights
that
brave
creature
lived
in
the
tower
that
often
rocked
as
if
it
would
come
down
while
the
sleet
and
snow
dimmed
the
lantern
and
were
beaten
to
death
against
the
glass
but
the
light
burned
steadily
and
people
said
is
well
as
ships
steered
away
in
time
when
the
clear
light
warned
them
of
danger
and
grateful
sailors
blessed
the
hands
that
kept
it
burning
i
hope
she
got
rewarded
cried
an
eager
voice
as
the
paused
for
breath
only
did
my
duty
that
is
reward
enough
she
said
when
some
of
the
rich
men
at
the
port
heard
of
it
and
sent
her
money
and
thanks
she
took
the
money
however
for
ben
had
to
give
up
the
place
being
too
lame
to
do
the
work
he
earns
his
living
by
fishing
now
and
puts
away
most
of
his
pension
for
the
children
he
wo
last
long
and
then
they
must
take
care
of
themselves
for
the
old
woman
is
no
relation
and
the
girl
is
too
proud
to
hunt
up
the
forgetful
english
friends
if
they
have
any
but
i
do
fear
for
her
a
brave
lass
like
that
will
make
her
own
way
is
that
all
asked
several
voices
as
wallace
leaned
back
and
fanned
himself
with
his
hat
that
all
of
the
first
and
second
parts
the
third
is
yet
to
come
when
i
know
it
i
tell
you
perhaps
next
summer
if
we
meet
here
then
you
know
the
girl
what
is
she
doing
now
asked
miss
ellery
who
had
lost
a
part
of
the
story
as
she
sat
in
a
shadowy
nook
with
the
pensive
fred
we
all
know
her
she
is
washing
a
at
this
moment
i
believe
and
wallace
pointed
to
a
figure
on
the
beach
energetically
shaking
a
large
tin
article
that
shone
in
the
moonlight
ruth
really
how
romantic
and
interesting
exclaimed
miss
ellery
who
was
just
of
the
age
as
were
most
of
the
other
girls
to
enjoy
tales
of
this
sort
and
imagine
sensational
denouements
there
is
a
great
deal
of
untold
romance
in
the
lives
of
these
toilers
of
the
sea
and
i
am
sure
this
good
girl
will
find
her
reward
for
the
care
she
takes
of
the
old
man
and
the
boy
it
costs
her
something
i
discovered
for
she
wants
an
education
and
could
get
it
if
she
left
this
poor
place
and
lived
for
herself
but
she
wo
go
and
works
hard
to
get
money
for
grandpa
comfort
instead
of
buying
the
books
she
longs
for
i
think
young
ladies
that
there
is
real
heroism
in
cheerfully
selling
lilies
and
frying
fish
for
duty
sake
when
one
longs
to
be
studying
and
enjoying
a
little
of
the
youth
that
comes
but
once
said
wallace
oh
dear
yes
so
nice
of
her
we
might
take
up
a
contribution
for
her
when
we
get
home
i
head
the
paper
with
pleasure
and
give
all
i
can
afford
for
it
must
be
so
horrid
to
be
ignorant
at
her
age
i
dare
say
the
poor
thing
ca
even
read
just
fancy
and
miss
ellery
clasped
her
hands
with
a
sigh
of
pity
very
few
girls
can
read
fit
to
be
heard
murmured
miss
scott
do
let
them
affront
her
with
their
money
she
will
fling
it
in
their
faces
as
she
did
that
donkey
dollar
you
see
to
her
in
your
nice
delicate
way
aunty
and
give
her
a
lift
if
she
will
let
you
whispered
captain
john
in
the
old
lady
ear
do
waste
your
pity
miss
florence
ruth
reads
a
newspaper
better
than
any
woman
i
ever
knew
i
heard
her
doing
it
to
the
old
man
getting
through
shipping
news
and
politics
in
fine
style
i
would
offer
her
money
if
i
were
you
though
it
is
a
kind
thought
these
people
have
an
honest
pride
in
earning
things
for
themselves
and
i
respect
them
for
it
added
wallace
dear
me
i
should
as
soon
think
of
a
sand
skipper
having
pride
as
one
of
these
fishy
folks
in
this
stupid
little
place
observed
fred
moving
his
legs
into
the
shadow
as
the
creeping
moonlight
began
to
reveal
the
hideous
boots
why
not
i
think
they
have
more
to
be
proud
of
these
brave
honest
independent
people
than
many
who
never
earn
a
cent
and
swell
round
on
the
money
their
fathers
made
out
of
pork
rum
or
any
other
rather
unpleasant
or
disreputable
business
said
captain
john
with
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
as
he
changed
the
end
of
his
sentence
for
the
word
pickles
was
on
his
lips
when
aunt
mary
quick
touch
checked
it
some
saucy
girl
laughed
and
fred
squirmed
for
it
was
well
known
that
his
respectable
grandfather
whom
he
never
mentioned
had
made
his
large
fortune
in
a
we
all
rise
from
the
mud
in
one
sense
and
all
may
be
handsome
flowers
if
we
choose
before
we
go
back
after
blooming
to
ripen
our
seeds
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
where
we
began
said
miss
refined
voice
sounding
softly
after
the
masculine
ones
i
like
that
idea
thank
you
aunt
mary
for
giving
me
such
a
pretty
fancy
to
add
to
my
love
for
i
shall
remember
it
and
try
to
be
a
lovely
one
not
a
bit
ashamed
to
own
that
i
came
from
honest
farmer
stock
exclaimed
the
thoughtful
girl
who
had
learned
to
know
and
love
the
sweet
wise
woman
who
was
so
motherly
to
all
girls
hear
hear
cried
captain
john
heartily
for
he
was
very
proud
of
his
own
brave
name
kept
clean
and
bright
through
a
long
line
of
sailor
kin
now
let
us
sing
or
we
shall
have
no
time
suggested
miss
ellery
who
warbled
as
well
as
rippled
and
did
not
wish
to
lose
this
opportunity
of
singing
certain
sentimental
songs
appropriate
to
the
hour
so
they
tuned
their
pipes
and
made
music
in
the
air
for
an
hour
to
the
great
delight
of
sammy
who
joined
in
every
song
and
was
easily
persuaded
to
give
sundry
nautical
melodies
in
a
shrill
small
voice
which
convulsed
his
hearers
with
merriment
ruth
sings
awful
well
but
she
wo
afore
folks
he
said
as
he
paused
after
a
roaring
ditty
she
will
for
me
and
wallace
went
slowly
up
to
the
rock
not
far
away
where
ruth
sat
alone
listening
to
the
music
as
she
rested
after
her
long
day
work
such
airs
said
miss
ellery
in
a
sharp
tone
for
her
wind
of
the
summer
night
had
not
gone
well
owing
to
a
too
copious
supper
posing
for
lorelei
she
added
as
ruth
began
to
sing
glad
to
oblige
the
kind
old
gentleman
they
expected
some
queer
ballad
or
droning
hymn
and
were
surprised
when
a
clear
sweet
voice
gave
them
the
three
fishers
and
mary
on
the
sands
of
dee
with
a
simple
pathos
that
made
real
thrill
with
pleasure
and
filled
several
pairs
of
eyes
with
tears
more
please
more
called
captain
john
as
she
paused
and
as
if
encouraged
by
the
hearty
applause
her
one
gift
excited
she
sang
on
as
easily
as
a
bird
till
her
small
store
was
exhausted
i
call
that
music
said
miss
scott
as
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
it
comes
from
the
heart
and
goes
to
the
heart
as
it
should
now
we
do
want
anything
else
and
had
better
go
home
while
the
spell
most
of
the
party
followed
her
example
and
went
to
thank
and
say
to
ruth
who
felt
as
rich
and
happy
as
a
queen
with
the
money
wallace
had
slipped
into
her
pocket
and
the
pleasure
which
even
this
short
glimpse
of
a
higher
happier
life
had
brought
her
hungry
nature
as
the
boats
floated
away
leaving
her
alone
on
the
shore
she
sent
her
farewell
ringing
over
the
water
in
the
words
of
the
old
song
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
and
every
one
joined
in
it
with
a
will
especially
wallace
and
captain
john
and
so
the
evening
picnic
ended
tunefully
and
pleasantly
for
all
and
was
long
remembered
by
several
after
that
day
many
good
times
came
to
ruth
and
sammy
and
even
poor
old
grandpa
had
his
share
finding
the
last
summer
of
his
life
very
smooth
sailing
as
he
slowly
drifted
into
port
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
captain
john
being
a
sailor
should
like
to
go
and
read
and
yarn
with
the
old
fisherman
so
no
one
wondered
when
he
fell
into
the
way
of
rowing
over
to
the
island
very
often
with
his
pocket
full
of
newspapers
and
whiling
away
the
long
hours
in
the
little
house
as
full
of
sea
smells
and
salt
breezes
as
a
shell
on
the
shore
miss
scott
also
took
a
fancy
to
go
with
her
nephew
for
being
an
ardent
botanist
she
discovered
that
the
island
possessed
many
plants
which
she
could
not
find
on
the
rocky
point
of
land
where
the
hotel
and
cottages
stood
the
pond
was
her
especial
delight
and
it
became
a
sort
of
joke
to
ask
when
she
came
home
brown
and
beaming
with
her
treasures
in
tin
boxes
bottles
and
bunches
well
aunt
mary
have
you
seen
the
bloom
yet
and
she
always
answered
with
that
wise
smile
of
hers
not
yet
but
i
biding
my
time
and
am
watching
a
very
fine
one
with
especial
interest
when
the
right
moment
comes
it
will
bloom
and
show
its
golden
heart
to
me
i
ruth
never
quite
knew
how
it
came
about
but
books
seemed
to
find
their
way
to
the
island
and
stay
there
to
her
great
delight
a
demand
for
lilies
sprang
up
and
when
their
day
was
over
became
the
rage
sammy
found
a
market
for
all
the
shells
and
gulls
wings
he
could
furnish
and
certain
old
curiosities
brought
from
many
voyages
were
sold
for
sums
which
added
many
comforts
to
the
old
sailor
last
cruise
now
the
daily
row
to
the
point
was
a
pleasure
not
a
trial
to
ruth
for
wallace
was
always
ready
with
a
kind
word
or
gift
the
ladies
nodded
as
she
passed
and
asked
how
the
old
skipper
was
miss
scott
often
told
her
to
stop
at
the
cottage
for
some
new
book
or
a
moment
chat
on
her
way
to
the
boat
and
captain
john
helped
sammy
with
his
fishing
so
much
that
the
baskets
were
always
full
when
they
came
home
all
this
help
and
friendliness
put
a
wonderful
energy
and
sweetness
into
ruth
hard
life
and
made
her
work
seem
light
her
patient
waiting
for
freedom
easier
to
bear
cheerfully
she
sang
as
she
stood
over
her
cheered
the
long
nights
of
watching
with
the
precious
books
and
found
the
few
moments
of
rest
that
came
to
her
when
the
day
work
was
done
very
pleasant
as
she
sat
on
her
rock
watching
the
lights
from
the
point
catching
the
sound
of
gay
music
as
the
young
people
danced
and
thinking
over
the
delightful
talks
she
had
with
miss
scott
perhaps
the
presence
of
a
blue
jacket
in
grandpa
little
bedroom
the
sight
of
a
friendly
brown
face
smiling
when
she
came
in
and
the
sonorous
murmur
of
a
man
voice
reading
aloud
added
a
charm
to
the
girl
humdrum
life
she
was
too
innocent
and
frank
to
deny
that
she
enjoyed
these
new
friends
and
welcomed
both
with
the
same
eagerness
saw
both
go
with
the
same
regret
and
often
wondered
how
she
ever
had
got
on
without
them
but
the
modest
never
dreamed
of
any
warmer
feeling
than
kindness
on
the
one
side
and
gratitude
on
the
other
and
this
unconsciousness
was
her
greatest
charm
especially
to
captain
john
who
hated
coquettes
and
shunned
the
silly
girls
who
wasted
time
in
idle
flirtation
when
they
had
far
better
and
wholesomer
pastimes
to
enjoy
the
handsome
sailor
was
a
favorite
being
handy
at
all
sorts
of
fun
and
the
oldest
of
the
young
men
at
the
point
he
was
very
courteous
in
his
hearty
way
to
every
woman
he
met
from
the
stateliest
dowager
to
the
dowdiest
but
devoted
himself
entirely
to
aunt
mary
and
seemed
to
have
no
eyes
for
younger
fairer
faces
he
must
have
a
sweetheart
over
the
sea
somewhere
the
damsels
said
among
themselves
as
they
watched
him
pace
the
long
piazzas
alone
or
saw
him
swinging
in
his
hammock
with
eyes
dreamily
fixed
on
the
blue
bay
before
him
miss
scott
only
smiled
when
curious
questions
were
asked
her
and
said
she
hoped
john
would
find
his
mate
some
time
for
he
deserved
the
best
wife
in
the
world
having
been
a
good
son
and
an
honest
boy
for
years
what
is
it
captain
a
steamer
asked
fred
as
he
came
by
the
cottage
one
august
afternoon
with
his
usual
escort
of
girls
all
talking
at
once
about
some
very
interesting
affair
only
a
no
steamers
answered
captain
john
dropping
the
glass
from
his
eye
with
a
start
can
you
see
people
on
the
island
with
that
thing
we
want
to
know
if
ruth
is
at
home
because
if
she
is
we
ca
waste
time
going
over
said
miss
ellery
with
her
sweetest
smile
i
think
not
that
boat
is
sammy
and
as
there
is
a
speck
of
red
aboard
i
fancy
miss
ruth
is
with
him
they
are
coming
this
way
so
you
can
hail
them
if
you
like
answered
the
sailor
with
a
speck
of
red
on
his
own
sunburnt
cheek
if
any
one
had
cared
to
look
then
we
wait
here
if
we
may
we
ordered
her
to
bring
us
a
quantity
of
bulrushes
and
flowers
for
our
tableaux
and
we
want
her
to
be
rebecca
at
the
well
she
is
so
dark
and
with
her
hair
down
and
gold
bangles
and
scarlet
shawls
i
think
she
would
do
nicely
it
takes
so
long
to
arrange
the
maid
of
astolat
we
must
have
an
easy
one
to
come
just
before
that
and
the
boys
are
wild
to
make
a
camel
of
themselves
so
we
planned
this
wo
you
be
jacob
or
abraham
or
whoever
the
man
with
the
bracelets
was
asked
miss
ellery
as
they
all
settled
on
the
steps
in
the
way
which
prevailed
at
the
point
no
thank
you
i
do
act
used
to
dance
hornpipes
in
my
young
days
but
gave
up
that
sort
of
thing
some
time
how
unfortunate
every
one
acts
it
all
the
fashion
began
miss
ellery
rolling
up
her
blue
eyes
imploringly
so
i
see
but
i
never
cared
much
for
theatricals
i
like
natural
things
how
unkind
you
are
i
quite
depended
on
you
for
that
since
you
would
be
a
fred
the
man
for
such
fun
he
going
to
startle
the
crowd
with
a
regular
captain
kidd
rig
pistols
and
cutlasses
enough
for
a
whole
crew
and
a
terrific
i
know
ruth
wo
do
it
floss
for
she
looked
amazed
when
i
showed
her
my
undine
costume
and
told
her
what
i
wanted
the
for
you
wo
stand
before
all
those
folks
dressed
that
way
will
you
she
said
as
much
scandalized
as
if
she
never
seen
a
dress
and
silk
stockings
before
and
miss
perry
tossed
her
head
with
an
air
of
pity
for
a
girl
who
could
be
surprised
at
the
display
of
a
pretty
neck
and
arms
and
ankles
we
hire
her
then
she
a
mercenary
wretch
and
will
do
anything
for
money
i
wo
be
scrambled
into
my
boat
in
a
hurry
and
we
must
have
rebecca
because
i
borrowed
a
fine
pitcher
and
promised
the
boys
their
camel
said
miss
ellery
who
considered
herself
the
queen
of
the
place
and
ruled
like
one
in
virtue
of
being
the
prettiest
girl
there
and
the
richest
she
has
landed
i
think
for
the
boat
is
off
again
to
the
wharf
better
run
down
and
help
her
with
the
bulrushes
fred
and
the
rest
of
the
stuff
you
ordered
suggested
captain
john
longing
to
go
himself
but
kept
by
his
duty
as
host
aunt
mary
being
asleep
upstairs
too
tired
wo
hurt
her
she
used
to
work
and
we
pamper
her
up
as
old
ladies
say
answered
fred
enjoying
his
favorite
lounge
on
the
grass
i
would
ask
her
to
act
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
said
captain
john
in
his
quiet
way
that
sort
of
thing
might
unsettle
her
and
make
her
discontented
she
steers
that
little
craft
over
there
and
is
happy
now
let
her
shape
her
own
course
and
remember
it
is
well
to
talk
to
the
man
at
the
miss
perry
stared
miss
ray
the
sharp
girl
nodded
and
miss
ellery
said
petulantly
as
if
it
mattered
what
she
thought
or
said
or
did
it
her
place
to
be
useful
if
we
want
her
and
we
need
worry
about
spoiling
a
girl
like
that
she
ca
be
any
prouder
or
more
saucy
than
she
is
and
i
shall
ask
her
if
only
to
see
the
airs
she
will
put
as
she
spoke
ruth
came
up
the
sandy
path
from
the
beach
laden
with
rushes
and
weeds
and
shells
looking
warm
and
tired
but
more
picturesque
than
ever
in
her
blue
gown
and
the
red
handkerchief
she
wore
since
her
old
hat
blew
away
seeing
the
party
on
the
cottage
steps
she
stopped
to
ask
if
the
things
were
right
and
miss
ellery
at
once
made
her
request
in
a
commanding
tone
which
caused
ruth
to
grow
very
straight
and
cool
and
sober
all
at
once
and
answer
decidedly
i
could
why
not
well
one
reason
is
i
do
think
it
right
to
act
things
out
of
the
bible
just
to
show
off
and
amuse
the
idea
of
minding
and
miss
ellery
frowned
adding
angrily
we
will
pay
you
for
it
i
find
people
will
do
anything
for
money
down
we
are
poor
and
need
it
and
this
is
our
best
time
to
make
it
do
most
anything
to
earn
a
little
but
not
that
and
ruth
looked
as
proud
as
the
young
lady
herself
then
we
say
no
more
if
you
are
too
elegant
to
do
what
we
mind
at
all
i
pay
you
for
this
stuff
now
as
i
ordered
it
and
you
need
bring
me
any
more
how
much
do
i
owe
you
asked
the
offended
beauty
taking
out
her
purse
in
a
pet
nothing
i
glad
to
oblige
the
ladies
if
i
can
for
they
have
been
very
kind
to
me
perhaps
if
you
knew
why
i
want
to
earn
money
understand
me
better
grandpa
ca
last
long
and
i
do
want
the
town
to
bury
him
i
working
and
saving
so
he
can
be
buried
decently
as
he
wants
to
be
not
like
a
there
was
something
in
ruth
face
and
voice
as
she
said
this
standing
there
shabby
tired
and
yet
honest
dutiful
and
patient
for
love
sake
that
touched
the
hearts
of
those
who
looked
and
listened
but
she
left
no
time
for
any
answer
for
with
the
last
word
she
went
on
quickly
as
if
to
hide
the
tears
that
dimmed
her
clear
eyes
and
the
quiver
of
her
lips
floss
how
could
you
cried
miss
ray
and
ran
to
take
the
sheaf
of
bulrushes
from
ruth
arms
followed
by
the
rest
all
ashamed
and
repentant
now
that
a
word
had
shown
them
the
hard
life
going
on
beside
their
idle
ones
captain
john
longed
to
follow
but
walked
into
the
house
growling
to
himself
with
a
grim
look
that
girl
has
no
more
heart
than
a
butterfly
and
i
like
to
see
her
squirm
on
a
pin
poor
ruth
we
settle
that
matter
and
bury
old
ben
like
an
admiral
hang
me
if
we
do
he
was
so
busy
talking
the
affair
over
with
aunt
mary
that
he
did
not
see
the
girl
flit
by
to
wait
for
her
boat
on
the
beach
having
steadily
refused
the
money
offered
her
though
she
accepted
the
apologies
in
the
kindest
spirit
the
beach
at
this
hour
of
the
day
was
left
to
the
nurses
and
maids
who
bathed
and
gossiped
while
the
little
people
played
in
the
sand
or
paddled
in
the
sea
several
were
splashing
about
and
one
german
governess
was
scolding
violently
because
while
she
was
in
the
her
charge
a
little
girl
of
six
had
rashly
ventured
out
in
a
tub
as
they
called
the
small
boats
used
by
the
gentlemen
to
reach
the
yachts
anchored
in
deep
water
ruth
saw
the
child
danger
at
a
glance
for
the
tide
was
going
out
carrying
the
frail
cockleshell
rapidly
away
while
the
child
risked
an
upset
every
moment
by
stretching
her
arms
to
the
women
on
the
shore
and
calling
them
to
help
her
none
dared
to
try
but
all
stood
and
wrung
their
hands
screaming
like
till
the
girl
throwing
off
shoes
and
heavy
skirt
plunged
in
calling
cheerily
sit
still
i
come
and
get
you
milly
she
could
swim
like
a
fish
but
encumbered
with
her
clothes
and
weary
with
an
unusually
hard
day
work
she
soon
found
that
she
did
not
gain
as
rapidly
as
she
expected
upon
the
receding
boat
she
did
not
lose
courage
but
a
thrill
of
anxiety
shot
through
her
as
she
felt
her
breath
grow
short
her
limbs
heavy
and
the
tide
sweep
her
farther
and
farther
from
the
shore
if
they
would
only
stop
screaming
and
go
for
help
i
could
keep
up
and
push
the
boat
in
but
the
child
will
be
out
presently
and
then
we
are
lost
for
i
ca
get
back
with
her
i
as
these
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
ruth
was
swimming
stoutly
and
trying
by
cheerful
words
to
keep
the
frightened
child
from
risking
their
main
chance
of
safety
a
few
more
strokes
and
she
would
reach
the
boat
rest
a
moment
then
clinging
to
it
push
it
leisurely
to
shore
feeling
that
the
danger
was
over
she
hurried
on
and
was
just
putting
up
her
hands
to
seize
the
frail
raft
and
get
her
breath
when
milly
thinking
she
was
to
be
taken
in
her
arms
leaned
forward
in
rushed
the
water
down
went
the
boat
and
out
splashed
the
screaming
child
to
cling
to
ruth
with
the
desperate
clutch
she
dreaded
both
went
under
for
a
moment
but
rose
again
and
with
all
her
wits
sharpened
by
the
peril
of
the
moment
ruth
cried
as
she
kept
herself
afloat
on
my
back
quick
quick
do
touch
my
arms
hold
tight
to
my
hair
and
keep
not
realizing
all
the
danger
and
full
of
faith
in
ruth
power
to
do
anything
after
the
feats
of
diving
and
floating
she
had
seen
her
perform
milly
scrambled
up
as
often
before
and
clung
spluttering
and
gasping
to
ruth
strong
shoulders
so
burdened
and
conscious
of
strength
ruth
turned
toward
the
shore
and
bent
every
power
of
mind
and
body
to
her
task
how
far
away
it
seemed
how
still
the
women
were
not
one
even
venturing
out
a
little
way
to
help
her
and
no
man
in
sight
her
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
her
temples
throbbed
her
breath
was
checked
by
the
clinging
arms
and
the
child
seemed
to
grow
heavier
every
moment
i
do
what
i
can
but
oh
why
do
some
one
come
that
was
the
last
thought
ruth
was
conscious
of
as
she
panted
and
ploughed
slowly
back
with
such
a
set
white
face
and
wide
eyes
fixed
on
the
flag
that
fluttered
from
the
nearest
cottage
that
it
was
no
wonder
the
women
grew
still
as
they
watched
her
one
good
catholic
nurse
fell
on
her
knees
to
pray
the
maids
cried
the
governess
murmured
mein
gott
i
am
lost
if
the
child
go
drowned
and
clear
and
sweet
came
the
sound
of
captain
john
whistle
as
he
stood
on
his
piazza
waiting
to
row
ruth
home
they
were
nearly
in
a
few
more
strokes
and
she
could
touch
the
bottom
when
suddenly
all
grew
black
before
her
eyes
and
whispering
i
float
call
milly
and
do
mind
me
ruth
turned
over
still
holding
the
child
fast
and
with
nothing
but
her
face
out
of
water
feebly
struggled
on
come
and
get
me
she
going
down
oh
come
quick
called
the
child
in
a
tone
of
such
distress
that
the
selfish
german
bestirred
herself
at
last
and
began
to
wade
cautiously
in
seeing
help
at
hand
brave
little
milly
soon
let
go
and
struck
out
like
an
energetic
young
frog
while
ruth
quite
spent
sank
quietly
down
with
a
dim
sense
that
her
last
duty
was
done
and
rest
had
come
the
shrill
cries
of
the
women
when
they
saw
the
steady
white
face
disappear
and
rise
no
more
reached
captain
john
ear
and
sent
him
flying
down
the
path
sure
that
some
one
was
in
danger
ruth
gone
down
out
there
was
all
he
caught
as
many
voices
tried
to
tell
the
tale
and
waiting
for
no
more
he
threw
off
hat
and
coat
and
dashed
into
the
sea
as
if
ready
to
search
the
atlantic
till
he
found
her
she
was
safe
in
a
moment
and
pausing
only
to
send
one
girl
flying
for
the
doctor
he
carried
his
streaming
burden
straight
home
to
aunt
mary
who
had
her
between
blankets
before
a
soul
arrived
and
was
rubbing
for
dear
life
while
john
fired
up
the
spirit
lamp
for
hot
brandy
and
water
with
hands
that
trembled
as
he
splashed
about
like
an
agitated
newfoundland
fresh
from
a
swim
ruth
was
soon
conscious
but
too
much
exhausted
to
do
or
say
anything
and
lay
quietly
suffering
the
discomforts
of
resuscitation
till
she
fell
asleep
is
milly
safe
was
all
she
asked
and
being
assured
that
the
child
was
in
her
mother
arms
and
sammy
had
gone
to
tell
grandpa
all
about
it
she
smiled
and
shut
her
eyes
with
a
whispered
then
all
right
thank
god
all
that
evening
captain
john
paced
the
piazza
and
warned
away
the
eager
callers
who
flocked
down
to
ask
about
the
heroine
of
the
hour
for
she
was
more
interesting
than
undine
the
lily
maid
or
any
of
the
pretty
creatures
attitudinizing
behind
the
red
curtains
in
the
hot
hotel
parlor
all
that
night
aunt
mary
watched
the
deep
sleep
that
restored
the
girl
and
now
and
then
crept
out
to
tell
her
nephew
there
was
nothing
to
fear
for
one
so
strong
and
healthful
and
all
night
ruth
dreamed
strange
dreams
some
weird
and
dim
some
full
of
pain
and
fear
but
as
the
fever
of
reaction
passed
away
lovely
visions
of
a
happy
place
came
to
her
where
faces
she
loved
were
near
and
rest
and
all
she
longed
for
was
hers
at
last
so
clear
and
beautiful
was
this
dream
that
she
waked
in
the
early
dawn
to
lie
and
think
of
it
with
such
a
look
of
peace
upon
her
face
that
aunt
mary
could
not
but
kiss
it
tenderly
when
she
came
in
to
see
if
all
was
well
how
are
you
dear
has
this
nice
long
sleep
set
you
up
again
as
i
hoped
oh
yes
i
quite
well
thank
you
and
i
must
go
home
grandpa
will
worry
so
till
he
sees
me
answered
ruth
sitting
up
with
her
wet
hair
on
her
shoulders
and
a
little
shiver
of
pain
as
she
stretched
her
tired
arms
not
yet
my
dear
rest
another
hour
or
two
and
have
some
breakfast
then
if
you
like
john
shall
take
you
home
before
any
one
comes
to
plague
you
with
idle
questions
i
not
going
to
say
a
word
except
that
i
proud
of
my
brave
girl
and
mean
to
take
care
of
her
if
she
will
let
with
that
and
a
motherly
embrace
the
old
lady
bustled
away
to
stir
up
her
maid
and
wake
john
from
his
first
nap
with
the
smell
of
coffee
a
most
unromantic
but
satisfying
perfume
to
all
the
weary
watchers
in
the
house
an
hour
later
dressed
in
miss
scott
gray
wrapper
and
shawl
ruth
came
slowly
to
the
beach
leaning
on
captain
john
arm
while
aunt
mary
waved
her
napkin
from
the
rocks
above
and
sent
kind
messages
after
them
as
they
pushed
off
it
was
the
loveliest
hour
of
all
the
day
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
but
sea
and
sky
were
rosy
with
the
flush
of
dawn
the
small
waves
rippled
up
the
sand
the
wind
blew
fresh
and
fragrant
from
hayfields
far
away
and
in
the
grove
the
birds
were
singing
as
they
only
sing
at
peep
of
day
a
still
soft
happy
time
before
the
work
and
worry
of
the
world
began
the
peaceful
moment
which
is
so
precious
to
those
who
have
learned
to
love
its
balm
and
consecrate
its
beauty
with
their
prayers
ruth
sat
silent
looking
about
her
as
if
she
saw
a
new
heaven
and
earth
and
had
no
words
in
which
to
tell
the
feeling
that
made
her
eyes
so
soft
sent
the
fresh
color
back
into
her
cheeks
and
touched
her
lips
with
something
sweeter
than
a
smile
captain
john
rowed
very
slowly
watching
her
with
a
new
expression
in
his
face
and
when
she
drew
a
long
breath
a
happy
sort
of
sigh
he
leaned
forward
to
ask
as
if
he
knew
what
brought
it
you
are
glad
to
be
alive
ruth
oh
so
glad
i
did
want
to
die
life
very
pleasant
now
she
answered
with
her
frank
eyes
meeting
his
so
gratefully
even
though
it
hard
it
easier
lately
you
and
dear
miss
mary
have
helped
so
much
i
see
my
way
clear
and
mean
to
go
right
on
real
brave
and
cheerful
sure
i
get
my
wish
at
so
do
i
and
captain
john
laughed
a
queer
happy
laugh
as
he
bent
to
his
oars
again
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
knew
where
he
was
going
and
longed
to
get
there
as
soon
as
possible
i
hope
you
will
i
wish
i
could
help
anyway
to
pay
for
all
done
for
me
i
know
you
do
want
to
be
thanked
for
fishing
me
up
but
i
mean
to
do
it
all
the
same
if
i
can
some
time
and
voice
was
full
of
tender
energy
as
she
looked
down
into
the
deep
green
water
where
her
life
would
have
ended
but
for
him
what
did
you
think
of
when
you
went
down
so
quietly
those
women
said
you
never
called
for
help
i
had
no
breath
to
call
i
knew
you
were
near
i
hoped
you
come
and
i
thought
of
poor
grandpa
and
sammy
as
i
gave
up
and
seemed
to
go
to
a
very
simple
answer
but
it
made
captain
john
beam
with
delight
and
the
morning
red
seemed
to
glow
all
over
his
brown
face
as
he
rowed
across
the
quiet
bay
looking
at
ruth
sitting
opposite
so
changed
by
the
soft
becoming
colors
of
her
dress
the
late
danger
and
the
dreams
that
still
lingered
in
her
mind
making
it
hard
to
feel
that
she
was
the
same
girl
who
went
that
way
only
a
day
ago
presently
the
captain
spoke
again
in
a
tone
that
was
both
eager
and
anxious
i
glad
my
idle
summer
has
been
quite
wasted
it
over
now
and
i
off
in
a
few
days
for
a
year
cruise
you
yes
miss
mary
told
me
you
were
going
soon
i
miss
you
both
but
maybe
you
come
next
year
i
will
please
god
so
will
i
for
even
if
i
get
away
this
fall
i
love
to
come
again
in
summer
and
rest
a
little
while
no
matter
what
i
find
to
come
and
stay
with
aunt
mary
if
this
home
is
gone
i
shall
want
sammy
next
time
i
settled
that
with
the
skipper
you
know
and
i
take
good
care
of
the
little
chap
he
not
much
younger
than
i
was
when
i
shipped
for
my
first
voyage
you
let
him
go
anywhere
with
you
he
set
his
heart
on
being
a
sailor
and
grandpa
likes
it
all
our
men
are
and
i
be
one
if
i
were
a
boy
i
love
the
sea
so
i
could
be
happy
long
away
from
even
though
it
nearly
drowned
you
yes
i
rather
die
that
way
than
any
other
but
it
was
my
fault
i
should
have
failed
if
i
had
been
so
tired
i
often
swum
farther
but
i
been
three
hours
in
the
marsh
getting
those
things
for
the
girls
and
it
was
and
i
been
up
nearly
all
night
with
grandpa
so
do
blame
the
sea
please
captain
you
should
have
called
me
i
was
waiting
for
you
i
did
know
it
i
used
to
doing
things
myself
it
might
have
been
too
late
for
milly
if
i
thank
god
i
was
too
late
for
the
boat
was
at
the
shore
now
and
as
he
spoke
captain
john
held
out
his
hands
to
help
ruth
down
for
encumbered
with
her
long
dress
and
still
weak
from
past
suffering
she
could
not
spring
to
land
as
she
used
to
do
in
her
short
gown
for
the
first
time
the
color
deepened
in
her
cheek
as
she
looked
into
the
face
before
her
and
read
the
meaning
of
the
eyes
that
found
her
beautiful
and
dear
and
the
lips
that
thanked
god
for
her
salvation
so
fervently
she
did
not
speak
but
let
him
lift
her
down
draw
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
lead
her
up
the
rocky
slope
to
the
little
pool
that
lay
waiting
for
the
sun
first
rays
to
wake
from
its
sleep
he
paused
there
and
with
his
hand
on
hers
said
quietly
ruth
before
i
go
i
want
to
tell
you
something
and
this
is
a
good
time
and
place
while
aunt
mary
watched
the
flowers
i
watched
you
and
found
the
girl
i
always
wanted
for
my
wife
modest
and
brave
dutiful
and
true
that
what
i
love
could
you
give
me
all
this
dear
for
the
little
i
can
offer
and
next
year
sail
with
sammy
and
a
very
happy
man
if
you
say
yes
i
not
half
good
and
wise
enough
for
that
remember
what
i
am
began
ruth
bending
her
head
as
if
the
thought
were
more
than
she
could
bear
i
do
remember
and
i
proud
of
it
why
dear
heart
i
worked
my
way
up
from
a
common
sailor
and
am
the
better
for
it
now
i
got
my
ship
and
i
want
a
mate
to
make
a
home
for
me
aboard
and
ashore
look
up
and
tell
me
that
i
did
read
those
true
eyes
then
ruth
lifted
up
her
face
and
the
sunshine
showed
him
all
he
asked
to
know
as
she
answered
with
her
heart
in
her
voice
and
the
true
eyes
fixed
on
his
i
tried
not
to
love
you
knowing
what
a
poor
ignorant
girl
i
am
but
you
were
so
kind
to
me
how
could
i
help
it
john
that
satisfied
him
and
he
sealed
his
happy
thanks
on
the
innocent
lips
none
had
kissed
but
the
little
brother
the
old
man
and
the
fresh
winds
of
the
sea
one
can
imagine
the
welcome
they
met
at
the
small
brown
house
and
what
went
on
inside
as
grandpa
blessed
the
lovers
and
sammy
so
overflowed
with
joy
at
his
enchanting
prospects
that
he
was
obliged
to
vent
his
feelings
in
ecstatic
jigs
upon
the
beach
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
gulls
and
sandpipers
at
breakfast
there
no
one
at
the
point
except
a
certain
dear
old
lady
knew
the
pleasant
secret
though
many
curious
or
friendly
visitors
went
to
the
island
that
day
to
see
the
heroine
and
express
their
wonder
thanks
and
admiration
all
agreed
that
partial
drowning
seemed
to
suit
the
girl
for
a
new
ruth
had
risen
like
venus
from
the
sea
a
softer
beauty
was
in
her
fresh
face
now
a
gentler
sort
of
pride
possessed
her
and
a
still
more
modest
shrinking
from
praise
and
publicity
became
her
well
no
one
guessed
the
cause
and
she
was
soon
forgotten
for
the
season
was
over
the
summer
guests
departed
and
the
point
was
left
to
the
few
cottagers
who
loved
to
linger
into
golden
september
miss
mary
was
one
of
these
and
captain
john
another
for
he
remained
as
long
as
he
dared
to
make
things
comfortable
for
the
old
man
and
to
sit
among
the
rocks
with
ruth
when
her
day
work
was
done
listening
while
his
mermaid
as
he
called
her
sang
as
she
had
never
sung
before
and
let
him
read
the
heart
he
had
made
his
own
for
the
lily
was
wide
open
now
and
its
gold
all
his
with
the
first
frosts
grandpa
died
and
was
carried
to
his
grave
by
his
old
comrades
owing
no
man
a
cent
thanks
to
his
dutiful
granddaughter
and
the
new
son
she
had
given
him
then
the
little
house
was
deserted
and
all
winter
ruth
was
happy
with
aunt
mary
while
sammy
studied
bravely
and
lived
on
dreams
of
the
joys
in
store
for
him
when
the
captain
came
sailing
home
again
another
summer
brought
the
happy
day
when
the
little
brown
house
was
set
in
order
for
a
sailor
honeymoon
when
the
flag
floated
gayly
over
miss
mary
cottage
and
ruth
in
a
white
gown
with
her
chosen
flowers
in
her
hair
and
bosom
shipped
with
her
dear
captain
for
the
long
cruise
which
had
its
storms
and
calms
but
never
any
shipwreck
of
the
love
that
grew
and
blossomed
with
the
by
the
sea
poppies
and
wheat
as
the
great
steamer
swung
round
into
the
stream
the
cloud
of
white
handkerchiefs
waving
on
the
wharf
melted
away
the
last
grew
fainter
and
those
who
went
and
those
who
stayed
felt
that
the
parting
was
over
it
may
be
for
years
and
it
may
be
forever
as
the
song
says
with
only
one
of
the
many
groups
on
the
deck
need
we
concern
ourselves
and
a
few
words
will
introduce
our
a
brisk
lady
leaned
on
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
in
spectacles
both
wearing
the
calmly
cheerful
air
of
people
used
to
such
scenes
and
conscious
only
of
the
relief
change
of
place
brings
to
active
minds
and
busy
lives
before
them
stood
two
girls
evidently
their
charges
and
as
evidently
not
sisters
for
in
all
respects
they
were
a
great
contrast
the
younger
was
a
gay
creature
of
seventeen
in
an
effective
costume
of
and
white
with
bright
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
sparkling
eyes
roving
everywhere
lively
tongue
going
and
an
air
of
girlish
excitement
pleasant
to
see
both
hands
were
full
of
farewell
bouquets
which
she
surveyed
with
more
pride
than
tenderness
as
she
glanced
at
another
group
of
girls
less
blessed
with
floral
offerings
her
companion
was
a
small
quiet
person
some
years
older
than
herself
very
simply
dressed
laden
with
wraps
and
apparently
conscious
just
then
of
nothing
but
three
dark
specks
on
the
wharf
as
she
still
waved
her
little
white
flag
and
looked
shoreward
with
eyes
too
dim
for
seeing
a
sweet
modest
face
it
was
with
intelligent
eyes
a
firm
mouth
and
the
look
of
one
who
had
early
learned
and
the
lady
and
gentleman
watched
the
pair
with
interest
and
amusement
for
both
liked
young
people
and
were
anxious
to
know
these
two
better
since
they
were
to
be
their
guides
and
guardians
for
six
months
professor
homer
was
going
abroad
to
look
up
certain
important
facts
for
his
great
historical
work
and
as
usual
took
his
wife
with
him
for
they
had
no
family
and
the
good
lady
was
ready
to
march
to
any
quarter
of
the
globe
at
short
notice
fearing
to
be
lonely
while
her
husband
pored
over
old
papers
in
foreign
libraries
homer
had
invited
ethel
amory
a
friend
daughter
to
accompany
her
of
course
the
invitation
was
gladly
accepted
for
it
was
a
rare
opportunity
to
travel
in
such
company
and
ethel
was
wild
with
delight
at
the
idea
one
thorn
however
vexed
her
among
the
roses
with
which
her
way
seemed
strewn
mamma
would
not
let
her
take
a
french
maid
but
preferred
a
young
lady
as
companion
for
three
being
an
awkward
number
a
fourth
party
would
be
not
only
convenient
but
necessary
on
the
girl
account
since
she
was
not
used
to
take
care
of
herself
and
homer
could
only
be
expected
to
act
as
chaperone
jane
bassett
is
just
the
person
i
want
and
jane
shall
go
she
needs
a
change
after
teaching
all
these
years
it
will
do
her
a
world
of
good
for
she
will
improve
and
enjoy
every
moment
and
the
salary
i
shall
offer
her
will
make
it
worth
her
while
said
amory
as
she
discussed
the
plan
with
her
daughter
she
is
only
three
years
older
than
i
am
and
i
hate
to
be
taken
care
of
and
watched
and
fussed
over
i
can
order
a
maid
round
but
a
companion
is
worse
than
a
governess
such
people
are
always
sensitive
and
proud
and
hard
to
get
on
with
every
one
takes
a
maid
and
i
set
my
heart
on
that
nice
marie
who
wants
to
go
home
and
talks
such
lovely
french
do
let
me
have
her
mamma
begged
ethel
who
was
a
spoiled
child
and
usually
got
her
own
way
but
for
once
mamma
stood
firm
having
a
strong
desire
to
benefit
her
daughter
by
the
society
of
better
companions
than
the
gay
girls
of
her
own
set
also
to
give
a
great
pleasure
to
good
little
jane
bassett
who
had
been
governessing
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
with
very
few
vacations
in
her
hard
dutiful
life
no
darling
i
have
asked
jane
and
if
her
mother
can
spare
her
jane
it
shall
be
she
is
just
what
you
need
sensible
and
kind
intelligent
and
capable
not
ashamed
to
do
anything
for
you
and
able
to
teach
you
a
great
deal
in
a
pleasant
way
homer
approves
of
her
and
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
for
travelling
is
not
all
as
you
expect
and
i
do
want
you
to
be
a
burden
on
our
friends
you
two
young
things
can
take
care
of
each
other
while
the
professor
and
his
wife
are
busy
with
their
own
affairs
and
jane
is
a
far
better
companion
for
you
than
that
coquettish
french
woman
who
will
probably
leave
you
in
the
lurch
as
soon
as
you
reach
paris
i
should
have
a
moment
peace
if
you
were
left
with
her
but
i
have
entire
confidence
in
jane
bassett
because
she
is
faithful
discreet
and
a
true
lady
in
all
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
and
ethel
pouted
in
vain
jane
accepted
the
place
with
joy
and
after
a
month
of
delightful
hurry
they
were
off
one
all
eagerness
for
the
new
world
the
other
full
of
tender
regret
for
the
dear
souls
left
behind
how
they
got
on
and
what
they
learned
remains
to
be
told
come
miss
bassett
we
ca
see
them
any
longer
so
we
may
as
well
begin
to
enjoy
ourselves
you
might
take
those
things
down
below
and
settle
the
stateroom
a
bit
i
going
to
walk
about
and
get
my
bearings
before
lunch
you
will
find
me
somewhere
ethel
spoke
with
a
little
tone
of
command
having
made
up
her
mind
to
be
mistress
and
keep
jane
bassett
in
her
place
though
she
did
know
three
languages
and
sketched
much
better
than
miss
amory
jenny
as
we
who
are
going
to
be
her
bosom
friends
will
call
her
nodded
cheerfully
and
looked
about
for
the
stairway
for
never
having
been
on
a
steamer
before
she
was
rather
bewildered
i
show
you
the
way
my
dear
i
always
get
my
things
settled
at
once
as
one
never
knows
when
one
may
have
to
turn
in
the
professor
will
go
with
you
ethel
it
is
not
proper
for
you
to
roam
about
alone
and
with
that
hint
homer
led
the
way
below
privately
wondering
how
these
young
persons
were
going
to
get
on
together
jane
swallowed
her
heimweh
in
silence
and
bestirred
herself
so
well
that
soon
the
stateroom
looked
very
cosy
with
the
wrappers
laid
ready
the
hanging
bags
tacked
up
and
all
made
for
the
ten
days
trip
but
where
are
your
comforts
you
have
given
ethel
all
the
room
the
lower
berth
and
the
best
of
everything
said
homer
popping
in
her
head
to
see
how
her
quiet
neighbor
got
on
oh
i
live
in
my
trunk
i
did
bring
half
as
many
little
luxuries
as
ethel
did
so
i
do
need
as
much
room
i
used
to
living
in
corners
like
a
mouse
and
i
get
on
very
well
answered
jane
looking
very
like
a
mouse
just
then
as
she
peeped
out
of
the
upper
berth
with
her
gray
gown
bright
eyes
and
quick
nod
of
contentment
well
my
dear
i
just
one
word
of
advice
to
give
you
do
let
that
child
tyrannize
over
you
she
means
well
but
is
wilful
and
thoughtless
and
it
is
not
your
duty
to
be
made
a
slave
of
assert
yourself
and
she
will
obey
and
respect
you
and
you
will
help
her
a
great
deal
i
know
all
about
it
i
was
a
companion
in
my
youth
and
had
a
hard
time
of
it
till
i
revolted
and
took
my
proper
place
now
let
us
go
up
and
enjoy
the
fine
air
while
we
thank
you
i
will
remember
and
jane
offered
the
good
lady
her
arm
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
such
friendliness
all
being
new
and
strange
to
her
and
many
doubts
of
her
own
fitness
for
the
position
lying
heavy
at
her
heart
but
soon
all
was
forgotten
as
she
sat
on
deck
watching
the
islands
lighthouses
ships
and
shores
glide
by
as
she
went
swiftly
out
to
sea
that
bright
june
day
here
was
the
desire
of
her
life
come
to
pass
at
last
and
now
the
parting
with
mother
and
sisters
was
over
nothing
but
pleasure
remained
and
a
very
earnest
purpose
to
improve
this
unexpected
opportunity
to
the
uttermost
the
cares
of
life
had
begun
early
for
little
jane
she
being
the
eldest
of
the
three
girls
and
her
mother
a
widow
first
came
hard
study
then
a
timid
beginning
as
nursery
governess
and
as
year
by
year
the
teaching
of
others
taught
her
she
ventured
on
till
here
she
was
companion
to
a
fine
young
lady
going
abroad
where
every
facility
for
acquiring
languages
studying
history
seeing
the
best
pictures
and
enjoying
good
society
would
all
be
hers
no
wonder
the
quiet
face
under
the
modest
gray
hat
beamed
as
it
turned
wistfully
toward
the
unknown
world
before
her
and
that
her
thoughts
were
so
far
away
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
kind
eyes
watching
her
as
homer
sat
placidly
knitting
beside
her
i
shall
like
the
mouse
i
quite
sure
hope
lemuel
will
be
as
well
satisfied
ethel
is
charming
when
she
chooses
but
will
need
looking
after
that
plain
thought
the
lady
as
she
glanced
down
the
deck
to
where
her
husband
stood
talking
with
several
gentlemen
while
his
charge
was
already
making
friends
with
the
gay
girls
who
were
to
be
her
daisy
millers
i
fear
went
on
homer
who
had
a
keen
eye
for
character
and
was
as
fond
of
studying
the
people
about
her
as
the
professor
was
of
looking
up
dead
statesmen
kings
and
warriors
the
young
ladies
certainly
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
type
of
american
girl
which
one
never
fails
to
meet
in
travelling
they
were
dressed
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
pretty
with
the
delicate
evanescent
beauty
of
too
many
of
our
girls
and
all
gifted
with
the
loud
voices
shrill
laughter
and
manners
which
so
astonish
decorous
english
matrons
and
maids
ethel
was
evidently
impressed
with
their
style
as
they
had
a
man
and
maid
at
their
beck
and
call
and
every
sign
of
ostentatious
wealth
about
them
a
stout
papa
a
thin
mamma
evidently
worn
out
with
the
cares
of
the
past
winter
three
girls
and
a
lad
of
sixteen
made
up
the
party
and
a
very
lively
one
it
was
as
the
professor
soon
found
for
he
presently
bowed
himself
away
and
left
ethel
to
her
new
friends
since
she
smilingly
refused
to
leave
them
ought
i
to
go
to
her
asked
jenny
waking
from
her
happy
reverie
to
a
sudden
sense
of
duty
as
the
gentleman
sat
down
beside
her
oh
dear
no
she
is
all
right
those
are
the
sibleys
of
new
york
her
father
knows
them
and
she
will
find
them
a
congenial
refuge
when
she
tires
of
us
quiet
folk
and
you
too
perhaps
added
the
professor
as
he
glanced
at
the
girl
i
think
not
i
should
not
be
welcome
to
them
nor
are
they
the
sort
of
people
i
like
i
shall
be
very
happy
with
the
folk
if
they
wo
let
me
be
in
the
way
answered
jenny
in
the
cheerful
voice
that
reminded
one
of
the
chirp
of
a
robin
we
wo
we
toss
you
overboard
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
scream
and
bounce
in
that
style
he
answered
laughing
at
the
idea
of
this
demure
young
person
ever
dreaming
of
such
a
thing
jenny
laughed
also
and
ran
to
pick
up
homer
ball
as
it
set
out
for
a
roll
into
the
as
she
brought
it
back
she
found
the
professor
examining
the
book
she
left
behind
her
like
all
young
travellers
you
cling
to
your
i
see
even
in
the
first
excitement
of
the
start
he
is
a
useful
fellow
but
i
know
my
europe
so
well
now
i
do
need
i
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
read
up
our
route
a
little
then
i
need
ask
questions
they
must
be
very
tiresome
to
people
who
know
all
about
it
said
jenny
regarding
him
with
an
expression
of
deep
respect
for
she
considered
him
a
sort
of
walking
encyclopaedia
of
universal
knowledge
it
pleased
the
learned
man
who
was
kindly
as
well
as
wise
and
loved
to
let
his
knowledge
overflow
into
any
thirsty
mind
however
small
the
cup
might
be
he
liked
the
intelligent
face
before
him
and
a
timid
question
or
two
set
him
off
on
his
favorite
hobby
at
a
pleasant
amble
with
jenny
on
the
pillion
behind
as
it
were
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
and
was
deep
in
french
history
when
the
lunch
gong
recalled
her
from
francis
and
his
sister
margaret
to
chops
and
english
ale
ethel
came
prancing
back
to
her
own
party
full
of
praises
of
the
sibleys
and
the
fun
they
meant
to
have
together
they
are
going
to
the
langham
so
we
shall
be
able
to
go
about
with
them
and
they
know
all
the
best
shops
and
some
lords
and
ladies
and
expect
to
be
in
paris
when
we
are
and
that
will
be
a
great
help
with
our
dresses
and
but
we
are
not
going
to
shop
and
have
new
dresses
till
we
are
on
our
way
home
you
know
now
we
have
time
for
such
things
and
ca
trouble
the
homers
with
more
trunks
answered
jenny
as
they
followed
their
elders
to
the
table
i
shall
buy
what
i
like
and
have
ten
trunks
if
it
suits
me
not
going
to
poke
round
over
old
books
and
ruins
and
live
in
a
all
the
time
you
can
do
as
you
like
different
with
me
and
know
what
is
with
which
naughty
speech
ethel
took
her
seat
first
at
the
table
and
began
to
nod
and
smile
at
the
sibleys
opposite
jenny
set
her
lips
and
made
no
answer
but
ate
her
lunch
with
what
appetite
she
could
trying
to
forget
her
troubles
in
listening
to
the
chat
going
on
around
her
all
that
afternoon
ethel
left
her
to
herself
and
enjoyed
the
more
congenial
society
of
the
new
acquaintances
jenny
was
tired
and
glad
to
read
and
dream
in
the
comfortable
seat
homer
left
her
when
she
went
for
her
nap
by
sunset
the
sea
grew
rough
and
people
began
to
vanish
below
there
were
many
empty
places
at
and
those
who
appeared
seemed
to
have
lost
their
appetites
suddenly
the
homers
were
good
sailors
but
jenny
looked
pale
and
ethel
said
her
head
ached
though
both
kept
up
bravely
till
nine
when
the
sibleys
precipitately
retired
after
supper
and
ethel
thought
she
might
as
well
go
to
bed
early
to
be
ready
for
another
pleasant
day
jenny
had
a
bad
night
but
disturbed
no
one
ethel
slept
soundly
and
sprang
up
in
the
morning
eager
to
be
the
first
on
deck
but
a
sudden
lurch
sent
her
and
her
into
a
corner
and
when
she
rose
everything
in
the
stateroom
seemed
to
be
turning
somersaults
while
a
deathly
faintness
crept
over
her
oh
wake
up
jane
we
are
sinking
what
is
it
help
me
help
me
and
with
a
dismal
wail
ethel
tumbled
into
her
berth
in
the
first
anguish
of
seasickness
we
will
draw
the
curtain
for
three
days
during
which
rough
weather
and
general
despair
reigned
homer
took
care
of
the
girls
till
jenny
was
able
to
sit
up
and
amuse
ethel
but
the
latter
had
a
hard
time
of
it
for
a
series
of
farewell
lunches
had
left
her
in
a
bad
state
for
a
and
the
poor
girl
could
not
lift
her
head
for
days
the
friends
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
her
after
a
call
of
condolence
but
faithful
jenny
sat
by
her
hour
after
hour
reading
and
talking
by
day
singing
her
to
sleep
at
night
and
often
creeping
from
her
bed
on
the
sofa
to
light
her
little
candle
and
see
that
her
charge
was
warmly
covered
and
quite
comfortable
ethel
was
used
to
being
petted
so
she
was
not
very
grateful
but
she
felt
the
watchful
care
about
her
and
thought
jane
almost
as
handy
a
person
as
a
maid
and
told
her
so
jenny
thanked
her
and
said
nothing
of
her
own
discomforts
but
homer
saw
them
and
wrote
to
amory
that
so
far
the
companion
was
doing
admirably
and
all
that
could
be
desired
a
few
days
later
she
added
more
commendations
to
the
she
kept
for
the
anxious
mothers
at
home
and
this
event
was
the
cause
of
her
fresh
praises
the
occupants
of
the
deck
staterooms
were
wakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
crash
and
a
cry
and
starting
up
found
that
the
engines
were
still
and
something
was
evidently
the
matter
somewhere
a
momentary
panic
took
place
ladies
screamed
children
cried
and
gentlemen
in
queer
costumes
burst
out
of
their
rooms
excitedly
demanding
what
is
the
matter
as
no
lamps
are
allowed
in
the
rooms
at
night
darkness
added
to
the
alarm
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
real
state
of
the
case
was
known
homer
went
at
once
to
the
frightened
girls
and
found
ethel
clinging
to
jenny
who
was
trying
to
find
the
lashed
to
the
wall
we
struck
do
leave
me
let
us
die
together
oh
why
did
i
come
why
did
i
come
she
wailed
while
the
other
girl
answered
with
a
brave
attempt
at
cheerfulness
as
she
put
over
ethel
head
the
only
she
could
find
i
will
i
will
be
calm
dear
i
guess
there
is
no
immediate
danger
hold
fast
to
this
while
i
try
to
find
something
warm
for
you
to
put
in
a
moment
jenny
candle
shone
like
a
star
of
hope
in
the
gloom
and
by
the
time
the
three
had
got
into
wrappers
and
shawls
a
peal
of
laughter
from
the
professor
assured
them
that
the
danger
could
not
be
great
other
sounds
of
merriment
as
well
as
voice
scolding
violently
was
heard
and
presently
homer
came
to
tell
them
to
be
calm
for
the
stoppage
was
only
to
cool
the
engines
and
the
noise
was
occasioned
by
joe
sibley
tumbling
out
of
his
berth
in
a
fit
of
nightmare
caused
by
welsh
rarebits
and
poached
eggs
at
eleven
at
night
much
relieved
and
a
little
ashamed
now
of
their
fright
every
one
subsided
but
ethel
could
not
sleep
and
clung
to
jenny
in
an
hysterical
state
till
a
soft
voice
began
to
sing
abide
with
me
so
sweetly
that
more
than
one
agitated
listener
blessed
the
singer
and
fell
asleep
before
the
comforting
hymn
ended
ethel
was
up
next
day
and
lay
on
the
professor
bearskin
rug
on
deck
looking
pale
and
interesting
while
the
sibleys
sat
by
her
talking
over
the
exciting
event
of
the
night
to
poor
joe
great
disgust
jenny
crept
to
her
usual
corner
and
sat
with
a
book
on
her
lap
quietly
reviving
in
the
fresh
air
till
she
was
able
to
enjoy
the
pleasant
chat
of
the
homers
who
established
themselves
near
by
and
took
care
of
her
learning
each
day
to
love
and
respect
the
faithful
little
soul
who
kept
her
worries
to
herself
and
looked
brightly
forward
no
matter
how
black
the
sky
might
be
only
one
other
incident
of
the
voyage
need
be
told
but
as
that
marked
a
change
in
the
relations
between
the
two
girls
it
is
worth
recording
as
she
prepared
for
bed
late
one
evening
homer
heard
jenny
say
in
a
tone
never
used
before
my
dear
i
must
say
something
to
you
or
i
shall
not
feel
as
if
i
were
doing
my
duty
i
promised
your
mother
that
you
should
keep
early
hours
as
you
are
not
very
strong
and
excitement
is
bad
for
you
now
you
wo
come
to
bed
at
ten
as
i
ask
you
to
every
night
but
stay
up
playing
cards
or
sitting
on
deck
till
nearly
every
one
but
the
sibleys
is
gone
homer
waits
for
us
and
is
tired
and
it
is
very
rude
to
keep
her
up
will
you
please
do
as
you
ought
and
not
oblige
me
to
say
you
must
ethel
was
sleepy
and
cross
and
answered
pettishly
as
she
held
out
her
foot
to
have
her
boot
unbuttoned
for
jenny
anxious
to
please
refused
no
service
asked
of
her
i
shall
do
as
i
like
and
you
and
homer
need
trouble
yourselves
about
me
mamma
wished
me
to
have
a
good
time
and
i
shall
there
is
no
harm
in
staying
up
to
enjoy
the
moonlight
and
sing
and
tell
stories
sibley
knows
what
is
proper
better
than
you
i
do
think
she
does
for
she
goes
to
bed
and
leaves
the
girls
to
flirt
with
those
officers
in
a
way
that
i
know
is
not
proper
answered
jenny
firmly
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
hear
them
say
of
you
as
they
did
of
the
sibley
girls
are
a
wild
lot
but
great
fun
did
they
say
that
how
impertinent
and
ethel
bridled
up
like
a
ruffled
chicken
for
she
was
not
out
yet
and
had
not
lost
the
modest
instincts
that
so
soon
get
blunted
when
a
frivolous
fashionable
life
begins
i
heard
them
and
i
know
that
the
people
on
board
do
not
like
the
sibleys
noisy
ways
and
bad
manners
now
you
my
dear
are
young
and
unused
to
this
sort
of
life
so
you
can
not
be
too
careful
what
you
say
and
do
and
with
whom
you
good
gracious
any
one
would
think
you
were
as
wise
as
solomon
and
as
old
as
the
hills
you
are
young
and
you
have
travelled
and
do
know
any
more
of
the
world
than
i
do
not
so
much
of
some
things
so
you
need
i
not
wise
nor
old
but
i
do
know
more
of
the
world
than
you
for
i
began
to
take
care
of
myself
and
earn
my
living
at
sixteen
and
four
years
of
hard
work
have
taught
me
a
great
deal
i
am
to
watch
over
you
and
i
intend
to
do
it
faithfully
no
matter
what
you
say
nor
how
hard
you
make
it
for
me
because
i
promised
and
i
shall
keep
my
word
we
are
not
to
trouble
homer
with
our
little
worries
but
try
to
help
each
other
and
have
a
really
good
time
i
will
do
anything
for
you
that
i
can
but
i
shall
not
let
you
do
things
which
i
would
allow
my
own
sisters
to
do
and
if
you
refuse
to
mind
me
i
shall
write
to
your
mother
and
ask
to
go
home
my
conscience
wo
let
me
take
money
and
pleasure
unless
i
earn
them
and
do
my
well
upon
my
word
cried
ethel
much
impressed
by
such
a
decided
speech
from
gentle
jane
and
dismayed
at
the
idea
of
being
taken
home
in
disgrace
we
wo
talk
any
more
now
because
we
may
get
angry
and
say
what
we
should
be
sorry
for
i
am
sure
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
when
you
think
it
over
quietly
so
was
all
the
reply
ethel
gave
and
a
long
silence
followed
homer
could
not
help
hearing
as
the
staterooms
were
close
together
and
the
doors
made
all
conversation
beyond
a
whisper
audible
i
did
think
jane
had
the
spirit
to
talk
like
that
she
has
taken
my
hint
and
asserted
herself
and
i
very
glad
for
ethel
must
be
set
right
at
once
or
we
shall
have
no
peace
she
will
respect
and
obey
jane
after
this
or
i
shall
be
obliged
to
say
my
homer
was
right
and
before
her
first
nap
set
in
she
heard
a
meek
voice
say
are
you
asleep
miss
bassett
no
then
i
want
to
say
i
thought
it
over
please
do
write
to
mamma
i
be
good
i
sorry
i
was
rude
to
you
do
forgive
the
sentence
was
not
ended
for
a
sudden
rustle
a
little
sob
and
several
hearty
kisses
plainly
told
that
jenny
had
flown
to
pardon
comfort
and
caress
her
naughty
child
and
that
all
was
well
after
that
ethel
behavior
was
painfully
decorous
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
which
fortunately
for
her
good
resolutions
ended
at
queenstown
much
to
her
regret
the
homers
thought
a
glimpse
at
ireland
and
scotland
would
be
good
for
the
girls
and
as
the
professor
had
business
in
edinburgh
this
was
the
better
route
for
all
parties
but
ethel
longed
for
london
and
refused
to
see
any
beauty
in
the
lakes
of
killarney
turned
up
her
nose
at
and
pronounced
dublin
a
stupid
place
scotland
suited
her
better
and
she
could
not
help
enjoying
the
fine
scenery
with
such
companions
as
the
homers
for
the
professor
knew
all
about
the
relics
and
ruins
and
his
wife
had
a
memory
richly
stored
with
the
legends
poetry
and
romance
which
make
dull
facts
memorable
and
history
enchanting
but
jenny
quiet
rapture
was
pleasant
to
behold
she
had
not
scorned
scott
novels
as
and
she
peopled
the
cottages
and
castles
with
his
heroes
and
heroines
she
crooned
burns
sweet
songs
to
herself
as
she
visited
his
haunts
and
went
about
in
a
happy
sort
of
dream
with
her
head
full
of
highland
mary
tam
o
shanter
and
daisies
or
fought
terrific
battles
with
and
marmion
and
tried
if
the
light
harebell
would
raise
its
head
elastic
from
her
airy
tread
as
it
did
from
the
lady
of
the
lake
famous
foot
ethel
told
her
she
was
clean
daft
but
jenny
said
let
me
enjoy
it
while
i
can
i
dreamed
of
it
so
long
i
can
hardly
realize
that
it
has
come
and
i
can
not
lose
a
minute
of
it
so
she
absorbed
scotch
poetry
and
romance
with
the
mist
and
the
keen
air
from
the
moors
and
bloomed
like
the
bonnie
heather
which
she
loved
to
wear
what
shall
we
do
this
rainy
day
in
this
stupid
place
said
ethel
one
morning
when
bad
weather
kept
them
from
an
excursion
to
stirling
castle
write
our
journals
and
read
up
for
the
visit
then
we
shall
know
all
about
the
castle
and
need
not
tire
people
with
our
questions
answered
jenny
already
established
in
a
deep
of
their
parlor
at
the
hotel
with
her
books
and
portfolio
i
do
keep
a
journal
and
i
hate
to
read
it
much
easier
to
ask
though
there
is
very
little
i
care
for
about
these
mouldy
old
places
said
ethel
with
a
yawn
as
she
looked
out
into
the
muddy
street
how
can
you
say
so
do
you
care
for
poor
mary
and
prince
charlie
and
all
the
other
sad
and
romantic
memories
that
haunt
the
country
why
it
seems
as
real
to
me
as
if
it
happened
yesterday
and
i
never
can
forget
anything
about
the
place
or
the
people
now
really
dear
i
think
you
ought
to
take
more
interest
and
improve
this
fine
chance
just
see
how
helpful
and
lovely
homer
is
with
a
quotation
for
every
famous
spot
we
see
it
adds
so
much
to
our
pleasure
and
makes
her
so
interesting
i
going
to
learn
some
of
the
fine
bits
in
this
book
of
hers
and
make
them
my
own
since
i
can
not
buy
the
beautiful
little
set
this
burns
belongs
to
do
you
want
to
try
it
and
while
away
the
dull
day
by
hearing
each
other
recite
and
talking
over
the
beautiful
places
we
have
seen
no
thank
you
no
study
for
me
it
is
to
be
all
play
now
why
tire
my
wits
with
that
scotch
stuff
when
homer
is
here
to
do
it
for
me
and
lazy
ethel
turned
to
the
papers
on
the
table
for
amusement
more
to
her
taste
but
we
should
think
only
of
our
own
pleasure
you
know
it
is
so
sweet
to
be
able
to
teach
amuse
or
help
others
in
any
way
glad
to
learn
this
new
accomplishment
so
that
i
may
be
to
some
one
what
dear
homer
is
to
us
now
if
i
ever
can
you
see
how
charmed
those
english
people
were
at
holyrood
when
she
was
reciting
those
fine
lines
to
us
the
old
gentleman
bowed
and
thanked
her
and
the
handsome
lady
called
her
book
of
elegant
extracts
i
thought
it
was
such
a
pretty
and
pleasant
thing
that
i
described
it
all
to
mother
and
the
so
it
was
but
did
you
know
that
the
party
was
lord
cumberland
and
his
family
the
guide
told
me
afterward
i
never
guessed
they
were
anybody
in
such
plain
tweed
gowns
and
thick
boots
did
you
i
knew
they
were
ladies
and
gentlemen
by
their
manners
and
conversation
did
you
expect
they
would
travel
in
coronets
and
ermine
mantles
laughed
jenny
i
not
such
a
goose
but
i
glad
we
met
them
because
i
can
tell
the
sibleys
of
it
they
think
so
much
of
titles
and
brag
about
lady
watts
barclay
whose
husband
is
only
a
brewer
knighted
i
shall
buy
a
plaid
like
the
one
the
lord
daughter
wore
and
wave
it
in
the
faces
of
those
girls
they
do
put
on
such
airs
because
they
have
been
in
europe
jenny
was
soon
absorbed
in
her
books
so
ethel
curled
herself
up
in
the
with
an
illustrated
london
paper
full
of
some
royal
event
and
silence
reigned
for
an
hour
neither
had
seen
the
professor
glasses
rise
like
two
full
moons
above
his
paper
now
and
then
to
peep
at
them
as
they
chatted
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
neither
saw
him
smile
as
he
made
a
memorandum
in
his
nor
guessed
how
pleased
he
was
at
jenny
girlish
admiration
of
his
plain
but
accomplished
and
excellent
wife
it
was
one
of
the
trifles
which
went
to
form
his
opinion
of
the
two
lasses
and
in
time
to
suggest
a
plan
which
ended
in
great
joy
for
one
of
them
now
the
real
fun
begins
and
i
shall
be
perfectly
contented
cried
ethel
as
they
rolled
through
the
london
streets
towards
the
dingy
langham
hotel
where
americans
love
to
congregate
jenny
eyes
were
sparkling
also
and
she
looked
as
if
quite
ready
for
the
new
scenes
and
excitements
which
the
famous
old
city
promised
them
though
she
had
private
doubts
as
to
whether
anything
could
be
more
delightful
than
scotland
the
sibleys
were
at
the
hotel
and
the
ladies
of
both
parties
at
once
began
a
round
of
shopping
and
sightseeing
while
the
gentlemen
went
about
their
more
important
affairs
joe
was
detailed
for
escort
duty
and
a
fine
time
the
poor
lad
had
of
it
trailing
about
with
seven
ladies
by
day
and
packing
them
into
two
cabs
at
night
for
the
theatres
and
concerts
they
insisted
on
trying
to
enjoy
in
spite
of
heat
and
weariness
homer
and
jenny
were
soon
tired
of
this
whirl
of
gayety
as
they
called
it
and
planned
more
quiet
excursions
with
some
hours
each
day
for
rest
and
the
writing
and
reading
which
all
wise
tourists
make
a
part
of
their
duty
and
pleasure
ethel
rebelled
and
much
preferred
the
rabble
as
joe
irreverently
called
his
troop
of
ladies
never
losing
her
delight
in
regent
street
shops
the
parks
at
the
fashionable
hour
and
the
evening
shows
in
full
blast
everywhere
during
the
season
she
left
the
sober
party
whenever
she
could
escape
and
with
sibley
as
chaperone
frolicked
about
with
the
gay
girls
to
her
heart
content
it
troubled
jenny
and
made
her
feel
as
if
she
were
not
doing
her
duty
but
homer
consoled
her
by
the
fact
that
a
month
was
all
they
could
give
to
london
and
soon
the
parties
would
separate
for
the
sibleys
were
bound
for
paris
and
the
professor
for
switzerland
and
germany
through
august
and
september
so
little
jane
gave
herself
up
to
the
pleasures
she
loved
and
with
the
new
friends
whose
kindness
she
tried
to
repay
by
every
small
service
in
her
power
spent
happy
days
among
the
famous
haunts
they
knew
so
well
learning
much
and
storing
away
all
she
saw
and
heard
for
future
profit
and
pleasure
a
few
samples
of
the
different
ways
in
which
our
young
travellers
improved
their
opportunities
will
sufficiently
illustrate
this
new
version
of
the
gay
grasshopper
and
the
thrifty
ant
when
they
visited
westminster
abbey
ethel
was
soon
tired
of
tombs
and
chapels
and
declared
that
the
startling
tableau
of
the
skeleton
death
peeping
out
of
the
door
of
the
tomb
to
throw
his
dart
at
nightingale
and
the
ludicrous
of
some
great
earl
in
full
peer
robes
and
coronet
being
borne
to
heaven
in
the
arms
of
fat
cherubs
puffing
under
their
load
were
the
only
things
worth
seeing
jenny
sat
spellbound
in
the
poets
corner
listening
while
homer
named
the
illustrious
dead
around
them
followed
the
verger
from
chapel
to
chapel
with
intelligent
interest
as
he
told
the
story
of
each
historical
or
royal
tomb
and
gave
up
madam
to
spend
several
happy
hours
sketching
the
beautiful
cloisters
in
the
abbey
to
add
to
her
collection
of
taken
as
she
went
from
place
to
place
to
serve
as
studies
for
her
pupils
at
home
at
the
tower
she
grew
much
excited
over
the
tragic
spots
she
visited
and
the
heroic
tales
she
heard
of
the
kings
and
queens
the
noble
hearts
and
wise
heads
that
pined
and
perished
there
ethel
hated
horrors
she
said
and
cared
only
for
the
crown
jewels
the
faded
effigies
in
the
armor
gallery
and
the
queer
highlanders
skirling
on
the
bagpipes
in
the
courtyard
at
kew
jenny
revelled
in
the
rare
flowers
and
was
stricken
with
amazement
at
the
victoria
regia
the
royal
so
large
that
a
child
could
sit
on
one
of
its
vast
leaves
as
on
a
green
island
her
interest
and
delight
so
touched
the
heart
of
the
crusty
keeper
that
he
gave
her
a
nosegay
of
orchids
which
excited
the
envy
of
ethel
and
the
sibley
girls
who
were
of
the
party
but
had
soon
wearied
of
plants
and
gone
off
to
order
tea
in
flora
bower
one
of
the
little
cottages
where
visitors
repose
and
refresh
themselves
with
weak
tea
and
bath
buns
in
such
tiny
rooms
that
they
have
to
put
their
wraps
in
the
fireplace
or
out
of
the
window
while
they
feast
at
the
few
parties
to
which
they
went
for
the
homers
friends
were
of
the
grave
elderly
sort
jenny
sat
in
a
corner
taking
notes
of
the
gay
scene
while
ethel
yawned
but
the
mouse
got
many
a
crumb
of
good
conversation
as
she
nestled
close
to
homer
drinking
in
the
wise
and
witty
chat
that
went
on
between
the
friends
who
came
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
professor
and
his
interesting
wife
each
night
jenny
had
new
and
famous
names
to
add
to
the
list
in
her
journal
and
the
artless
pages
were
rich
in
anecdotes
descriptions
and
comments
on
the
day
adventures
but
the
gem
of
her
london
collection
of
experiences
was
found
in
a
most
unexpected
way
and
not
only
gave
her
great
pleasure
but
made
the
young
gadabouts
regard
her
with
sudden
respect
as
one
come
to
honor
let
me
stay
and
wait
upon
you
i
much
rather
than
go
to
the
crystal
palace
for
i
should
enjoy
it
at
all
with
you
lying
here
in
pain
and
alone
said
jenny
one
lovely
morning
when
the
girls
came
down
ready
for
the
promised
excursion
to
find
homer
laid
up
with
a
nervous
headache
no
dear
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
thanks
quiet
is
all
i
need
and
my
only
worry
is
that
i
am
not
able
to
write
up
my
notes
for
him
i
promised
to
have
them
ready
last
night
but
was
so
tired
i
could
not
do
it
answered
homer
as
jenny
leaned
over
her
full
of
affectionate
anxiety
let
me
do
them
i
be
so
proud
to
help
and
i
can
for
i
did
copy
some
one
day
and
he
said
it
was
well
done
please
let
me
i
should
enjoy
a
quiet
morning
here
much
better
than
the
noisy
party
we
shall
have
since
the
sibleys
are
to
with
some
reluctance
the
invalid
consented
and
when
the
rest
were
gone
with
hasty
regrets
jenny
fell
to
work
so
briskly
that
in
an
hour
or
two
the
task
was
done
she
was
looking
wistfully
out
of
the
window
wondering
where
she
could
go
alone
since
homer
was
asleep
and
no
one
needed
her
when
the
professor
came
in
to
see
how
his
wife
was
before
he
went
to
the
british
museum
to
consult
certain
famous
books
and
parchments
he
was
much
pleased
to
find
his
notes
in
order
and
after
a
glance
at
the
sleeping
lady
told
jenny
she
was
to
come
with
him
for
a
visit
to
a
place
which
she
would
enjoy
though
most
young
people
thought
it
rather
dull
away
they
went
and
being
given
in
charge
to
a
pleasant
old
man
jenny
roamed
over
the
vast
museum
where
the
wonders
of
the
world
are
collected
enjoying
every
moment
till
homer
called
her
away
as
his
day
work
was
done
it
was
late
now
but
she
never
thought
of
time
and
came
smiling
up
from
the
egyptian
hall
ready
for
the
lunch
the
professor
proposed
they
were
just
going
out
when
a
gentleman
met
them
and
recognizing
the
american
stopped
to
greet
him
cordially
jenny
heart
beat
when
she
was
presented
to
gladstone
and
she
listened
with
all
her
ears
to
the
silvery
voice
and
stared
with
all
her
eyes
at
the
weary
yet
wise
and
friendly
face
of
the
famous
man
i
so
glad
i
wanted
to
see
him
very
much
and
i
feel
so
grand
to
think
i
really
had
a
bow
and
a
smile
all
to
myself
from
the
premier
of
england
said
jenny
in
a
flutter
of
girlish
delight
when
the
brief
interview
was
over
you
shall
go
to
the
house
of
commons
with
me
and
hear
him
speak
some
day
then
your
cup
will
be
full
since
you
have
already
seen
browning
heard
irving
taken
tea
with
jean
ingelow
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
royal
family
said
the
professor
enjoying
her
keen
interest
in
people
and
places
oh
thanks
that
will
be
splendid
i
do
love
to
see
famous
persons
because
it
gives
me
a
true
picture
of
them
and
adds
to
my
desire
to
know
more
of
them
and
admire
their
virtues
or
shun
their
yes
that
sort
of
mental
is
a
good
thing
to
have
and
we
will
add
as
many
fine
portraits
as
we
can
now
you
shall
ride
in
a
hansom
and
see
how
you
like
jenny
was
glad
to
do
so
for
ladies
do
not
use
these
vehicles
when
alone
and
ethel
had
put
on
great
airs
after
a
spin
in
one
with
joe
jenny
was
girl
enough
to
like
to
have
her
little
adventures
to
boast
of
and
that
day
she
was
to
have
another
which
eclipsed
all
that
her
young
companions
ever
knew
a
brisk
drive
a
cosy
lunch
at
a
famous
where
johnson
had
drunk
oceans
of
tea
was
followed
by
a
stroll
in
the
park
for
the
professor
liked
his
young
comrade
and
was
grateful
for
the
notes
which
helped
on
his
work
as
they
leaned
against
the
railing
to
watch
the
splendid
equipages
roll
by
one
that
seemed
well
known
though
only
conspicuous
by
its
quiet
elegance
stopped
near
them
and
the
elder
of
the
two
ladies
in
it
bowed
and
beckoned
to
professor
homer
he
hastened
forward
to
be
kindly
greeted
and
invited
to
drive
along
the
ladies
mile
jenny
breath
was
nearly
taken
away
when
she
was
presented
to
the
duchess
of
s
and
found
herself
sitting
in
a
luxurious
carriage
opposite
her
grace
and
her
companion
with
a
coachman
perched
aloft
and
two
powdered
footmen
erect
behind
secretly
rejoicing
that
she
had
made
herself
especially
nice
for
her
trip
with
the
professor
and
remembering
that
young
english
girls
are
expected
to
efface
themselves
in
the
company
of
their
elders
she
sat
mute
and
modest
stealing
shy
glances
from
under
her
at
the
great
lady
who
was
talking
in
the
simplest
way
with
her
guest
about
his
work
in
which
as
a
member
of
one
of
the
historical
houses
of
england
she
took
much
interest
a
few
gracious
words
fell
to
jenny
share
before
they
were
set
down
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
porter
who
recognized
the
liveries
and
spread
the
news
this
is
a
good
sample
of
the
way
things
go
in
vanity
fair
we
trudge
away
to
our
daily
work
afoot
we
treat
ourselves
to
a
humble
cab
through
the
mud
pause
in
the
park
to
watch
the
rich
and
great
get
whisked
into
a
ducal
carriage
and
come
home
in
state
feeling
rather
exalted
do
we
asked
the
professor
as
they
went
upstairs
and
he
observed
the
new
air
of
dignity
which
jane
unconsciously
assumed
as
an
obsequious
waiter
flew
before
to
open
the
door
i
think
we
do
answered
honest
jane
laughing
as
she
caught
the
twinkle
of
his
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
i
like
splendor
and
i
am
rather
set
up
to
think
i
spoken
to
a
live
duchess
but
i
think
i
like
her
beautiful
old
face
and
charming
manners
more
than
her
fine
coach
or
great
name
why
she
was
much
more
simply
dressed
than
sibley
and
talked
as
pleasantly
as
if
she
did
not
feel
a
bit
above
us
yet
one
could
forget
that
she
was
noble
and
lived
in
a
very
different
world
from
that
is
just
it
my
dear
she
is
a
noble
woman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
has
a
right
to
her
title
her
ancestors
were
kingmakers
and
she
is
to
the
queen
yet
she
leads
the
charities
of
london
and
is
the
friend
of
all
who
help
the
world
along
i
glad
you
have
met
her
and
seen
so
good
a
sample
of
a
true
aristocrat
we
americans
affect
to
scorn
titles
but
too
many
of
us
hanker
for
them
in
secret
and
bow
before
very
poor
imitations
of
the
real
thing
do
fill
your
journal
with
fine
names
as
some
much
wiser
folk
do
but
set
down
only
the
best
and
remember
that
glitters
is
not
gold
i
will
and
jenny
put
away
the
little
sermon
side
by
side
with
the
little
adventure
saying
nothing
of
either
till
homer
spoke
of
it
having
heard
the
story
from
her
husband
how
i
wish
i
been
there
instead
of
fagging
round
that
great
palace
full
of
rubbish
a
real
duchess
wo
the
sibleys
stare
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
lady
watts
barclay
after
this
i
guess
and
you
will
be
treated
with
great
respect
see
if
you
are
not
said
ethel
much
impressed
with
her
companion
good
fortune
and
eager
to
tell
it
if
things
of
that
sort
affect
them
their
respect
is
not
worth
having
answered
jane
quietly
accepting
the
arm
ethel
offered
her
as
they
went
to
dinner
a
very
unusual
courtesy
the
cause
of
which
she
understood
and
smiled
at
ethel
looked
as
if
she
felt
the
reproof
but
said
nothing
only
set
an
example
of
greater
civility
to
her
companion
which
the
other
girls
involuntarily
followed
after
they
had
heard
of
excursion
with
the
professor
the
change
was
very
grateful
to
patient
jane
who
had
borne
many
small
slights
in
proud
silence
but
it
was
soon
over
for
the
parties
separated
and
our
friends
left
the
city
far
behind
them
as
they
crossed
the
channel
and
sailed
up
the
rhine
to
schwalbach
where
homer
was
to
try
the
steel
springs
for
her
rheumatism
while
the
professor
rested
after
his
london
labors
a
charming
journey
and
several
very
happy
weeks
followed
as
the
girls
roamed
about
the
little
brunnen
gay
with
people
from
all
parts
of
europe
come
to
try
the
famous
mineral
waters
and
rest
under
the
lindens
jenny
found
plenty
to
sketch
here
and
was
busy
all
day
booking
picturesque
groups
as
they
sat
in
the
allee
saal
doing
pretty
woodland
bits
as
they
strolled
among
the
hills
carefully
copying
the
arches
and
statues
in
elizabeth
chapel
or
the
queer
old
houses
in
the
jews
quarter
of
the
town
even
the
pigs
went
into
the
portfolio
with
the
little
swineherd
blowing
his
horn
in
the
morning
to
summon
each
lazy
porker
from
its
sty
to
join
the
troop
that
trotted
away
to
eat
acorns
in
the
oak
wood
on
the
hill
till
sunset
called
them
home
again
ethel
chief
amusement
was
buying
trinkets
at
the
booths
near
the
stahlbrunnen
a
tempting
display
of
pretty
crystal
agate
and
steel
jewelry
was
there
with
french
bonbons
swiss
carvings
german
embroidery
and
and
most
delectable
little
portfolios
of
views
of
fine
scenery
or
illustrations
of
famous
books
ethel
spent
much
money
here
and
added
so
greatly
to
her
store
of
souvenirs
that
a
new
trunk
was
needed
to
hold
the
brittle
treasures
she
accumulated
in
spite
of
the
advice
given
her
to
wait
till
she
reached
paris
where
all
could
be
bought
much
cheaper
and
packed
safely
for
transportation
jenny
contented
herself
with
a
german
book
kaulbach
goethe
gallery
and
a
set
of
ornaments
for
each
sister
the
purple
pink
and
white
crystals
being
cheap
and
pretty
trinkets
for
young
girls
she
felt
very
rich
with
her
generous
salary
to
draw
upon
when
she
liked
but
having
made
a
list
of
proper
gifts
she
resisted
temptation
and
saved
her
money
remembering
how
much
every
penny
was
needed
at
home
driving
from
the
ruins
of
hohenstein
one
lovely
afternoon
the
girls
got
out
to
walk
up
a
long
hill
and
amused
themselves
gathering
flowers
by
the
way
when
they
took
their
places
again
ethel
had
a
great
bouquet
of
scarlet
poppies
jenny
a
nosegay
of
blue
for
homer
and
a
handful
of
green
wheat
for
herself
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
gleaning
said
the
professor
as
he
watched
the
girls
begin
to
trim
their
rough
straw
hats
with
the
gay
coquelicots
and
the
bearded
ears
i
feel
as
if
i
were
doing
that
every
day
sir
and
gathering
in
a
great
harvest
of
pleasure
if
nothing
else
answered
jenny
turning
her
bright
eyes
full
of
gratitude
from
one
kind
face
to
the
other
my
poppies
are
much
prettier
than
that
stiff
stuff
why
did
you
get
some
asked
ethel
surveying
her
brilliant
decoration
with
great
satisfaction
they
do
last
but
my
wheat
will
and
only
grow
prettier
as
it
ripens
in
my
hat
answered
jenny
contentedly
settling
the
graceful
spires
in
the
straw
cord
that
bound
the
pointed
crown
then
the
kernels
will
all
drop
out
and
leave
the
husks
that
be
nice
i
sure
laughed
ethel
well
some
hungry
bird
will
pick
them
up
and
be
glad
of
them
the
husks
will
last
a
long
time
and
remind
me
of
this
happy
day
your
poppies
are
shedding
their
leaves
already
and
the
odor
is
not
pleasant
i
like
my
honest
breadmaking
wheat
better
than
your
opium
flowers
said
jenny
with
her
thoughtful
smile
as
she
watched
the
scarlet
petals
float
away
leaving
the
green
bare
oh
i
shall
get
some
artificial
ones
at
my
little
milliner
and
be
fine
as
long
as
i
like
so
you
are
welcome
to
your
useful
bristly
old
wheat
said
ethel
rather
nettled
by
the
look
that
passed
between
the
elders
nothing
more
was
said
but
both
girls
remembered
that
little
talk
long
afterward
for
those
two
wayside
nosegays
served
to
point
the
moral
of
this
little
tale
if
not
to
adorn
it
we
have
no
space
to
tell
all
the
pleasant
wanderings
of
our
travellers
as
they
went
from
one
interesting
place
to
another
till
they
paused
for
a
good
rest
at
geneva
here
ethel
quite
lost
her
head
among
the
glittering
display
of
jewelry
and
had
to
be
watched
lest
she
rashly
spend
her
last
penny
they
were
obliged
almost
forcibly
to
carry
her
out
of
the
enchanting
shops
and
no
one
felt
safe
till
she
was
either
on
the
lake
or
driving
to
chamouni
or
asleep
in
her
bed
jenny
bought
a
watch
a
very
necessary
thing
for
a
teacher
and
this
was
the
best
place
to
get
a
good
one
it
was
chosen
with
care
and
much
serious
consultation
with
the
professor
and
homer
added
a
little
chain
and
seal
finding
jenny
about
to
content
herself
with
a
black
cord
it
is
only
a
return
for
many
daughterly
services
my
dear
and
my
husband
wishes
me
to
offer
these
with
thanks
to
the
patient
secretary
who
has
often
helped
him
so
willingly
she
said
as
she
came
to
wake
jenny
with
a
kiss
on
the
morning
of
her
birthday
a
set
of
little
volumes
like
those
she
had
admired
was
the
second
gift
and
jenny
was
much
touched
to
be
so
kindly
remembered
ethel
gave
her
some
thread
lace
which
she
had
longed
to
buy
for
her
mother
at
brussels
but
did
not
finding
it
as
costly
as
beautiful
it
was
a
very
happy
day
though
quietly
spent
sitting
by
the
lake
enjoying
the
extracts
from
shakspeare
wordsworth
byron
burns
scott
and
other
descriptive
poets
and
writing
loving
letters
home
proudly
stamped
with
the
little
seal
after
that
while
ethel
haunted
the
brilliant
shops
read
novels
in
the
or
listlessly
followed
the
jenny
with
the
help
of
her
valuable
little
library
her
industrious
pencil
and
her
accomplished
guides
laid
up
a
store
of
precious
souvenirs
as
they
visited
the
celebrated
spots
that
lie
like
a
necklace
of
pearls
around
the
lovely
lake
with
mont
blanc
as
the
splendid
opal
that
fitly
clasps
the
chain
calvin
and
geneva
voltaire
and
ferney
de
stael
and
coppet
gibbon
garden
at
lausanne
byron
prisoner
at
chillon
rousseau
chestnut
grove
at
clarens
and
all
the
legends
relics
and
memories
of
heroes
romancers
poets
and
philosophers
were
carefully
studied
recorded
and
enjoyed
and
when
at
last
they
steamed
away
toward
paris
jenny
felt
as
if
her
head
and
her
heart
and
one
little
trunk
held
richer
treasures
than
all
the
jewelry
in
geneva
at
lyons
her
second
important
purchase
was
made
for
when
they
visited
one
of
the
great
manufactories
to
execute
several
commissions
given
to
homer
jenny
proudly
bought
a
nice
black
silk
for
her
mother
this
with
the
delicate
lace
would
make
the
dear
woman
presentable
for
many
a
day
and
the
good
girl
beamed
with
satisfaction
as
she
pictured
the
delight
of
all
at
home
when
this
splendid
gift
appeared
to
adorn
the
dear
who
never
cared
how
shabby
she
was
if
her
young
were
well
feathered
it
was
a
trial
to
jenny
when
they
reached
paris
to
spend
day
after
day
shopping
talking
to
dressmakers
and
driving
in
the
bois
to
watch
the
elegant
world
on
parade
when
she
longed
to
be
living
through
the
french
revolution
with
carlyle
copying
the
quaint
relics
at
hotel
cluny
or
revelling
in
the
treasures
of
the
louvre
why
do
you
want
to
study
and
poke
all
the
time
asked
ethel
as
they
followed
homer
and
a
french
acquaintance
round
the
palais
royal
one
day
with
its
brilliant
shops
cafes
and
crowds
my
dream
is
to
be
able
to
take
a
place
as
teacher
of
german
and
history
in
a
girl
school
next
year
it
is
a
fine
chance
and
i
am
promised
it
if
i
am
fitted
so
i
must
work
when
i
can
to
be
ready
that
is
why
i
like
versailles
better
than
rue
de
rivoli
and
enjoy
talking
with
professor
homer
about
french
kings
and
queens
more
than
i
do
buying
mock
diamonds
and
eating
ices
here
answered
jenny
looking
very
tired
of
the
glitter
noise
and
dust
of
the
gay
place
when
her
heart
was
in
the
conciergerie
with
poor
marie
antoinette
or
the
invalides
where
lay
the
great
napoleon
still
guarded
by
his
faithful
frenchmen
what
a
dismal
prospect
i
should
think
you
rather
have
a
jolly
time
while
you
could
and
trust
to
luck
for
a
place
if
you
must
go
on
teaching
said
ethel
stopping
to
admire
a
window
full
of
distracting
bonnets
no
it
is
a
charming
prospect
to
me
for
i
love
to
teach
and
i
ca
leave
anything
to
luck
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
mother
says
and
i
want
to
give
the
girls
an
easier
time
than
i
have
had
so
i
shall
get
my
tools
ready
and
fit
myself
to
do
good
work
when
the
job
comes
to
me
answered
jenny
with
such
a
decided
air
that
the
french
lady
glanced
back
at
her
wondering
if
a
quarrel
was
going
on
between
the
demoiselles
what
do
you
mean
by
tools
asked
ethel
turning
from
the
gay
bonnets
to
a
ravishing
display
of
bonbons
in
the
next
window
professor
homer
said
one
day
that
a
mind
was
a
with
which
one
could
carve
one
way
now
my
tools
are
knowledge
memory
taste
the
power
of
imparting
what
i
know
good
manners
sense
and
patience
added
jenny
with
a
sigh
as
she
thought
of
the
weary
years
spent
in
teaching
little
children
the
alphabet
ethel
took
the
sigh
to
herself
well
knowing
that
she
had
been
a
trial
especially
of
late
when
she
had
insisted
on
jane
company
because
her
own
french
was
so
imperfect
as
to
be
nearly
useless
though
at
home
she
had
flattered
herself
that
she
knew
a
good
deal
her
own
ignorance
of
many
things
had
been
unpleasantly
impressed
upon
her
lately
for
at
madame
dene
pension
there
were
several
agreeable
english
and
french
ladies
and
much
interesting
conversation
went
on
at
the
table
which
jenny
heartily
enjoyed
though
she
modestly
said
very
little
but
ethel
longing
to
distinguish
herself
before
the
quiet
english
girls
tried
to
talk
and
often
made
sad
mistakes
because
her
head
was
a
jumble
of
new
names
and
places
and
her
knowledge
of
all
kinds
very
superficial
only
the
day
before
she
had
said
in
a
patronizing
tone
to
a
french
lady
of
course
we
remember
our
obligations
to
your
lamartine
during
our
revolution
and
the
other
brave
frenchmen
who
helped
you
mean
lafayette
dear
whispered
jenny
quickly
as
the
lady
smiled
and
bowed
bewildered
by
the
queerly
pronounced
french
but
catching
the
poet
name
i
know
what
i
mean
you
need
trouble
yourself
to
correct
and
interrupt
me
when
i
talking
answered
ethel
in
her
pert
way
annoyed
by
a
smile
on
the
face
of
the
girl
opposite
and
blush
at
her
rudeness
and
ingratitude
she
regretted
both
when
jane
explained
the
matter
afterward
and
wished
that
she
had
at
once
corrected
what
would
then
have
passed
as
a
slip
of
the
tongue
now
it
was
too
late
but
she
kept
quiet
and
gave
miss
cholmondeley
no
more
chances
to
smile
in
that
aggravatingly
superior
way
though
it
was
very
natural
as
she
was
a
highly
educated
girl
thinking
of
this
and
many
other
mistakes
of
her
own
from
which
jane
tried
to
save
her
ethel
felt
a
real
remorse
and
walked
silently
on
wondering
how
she
could
reward
this
kind
creature
who
had
served
her
so
well
and
was
so
anxious
to
get
on
in
her
hard
humble
way
the
orders
were
all
given
now
the
shopping
nearly
done
and
mademoiselle
campan
the
elderly
french
lady
who
boarded
at
their
pension
was
always
ready
to
jaunt
about
and
be
useful
so
why
not
give
jane
a
holiday
and
let
her
grub
and
study
for
the
little
while
left
them
in
paris
in
a
fortnight
uncle
sam
was
to
pick
up
the
girls
and
take
them
home
while
the
homers
went
to
rome
for
the
winter
it
would
be
well
to
take
miss
bassett
back
in
a
good
humor
so
that
her
report
would
please
mamma
and
appease
papa
if
he
were
angry
at
the
amount
of
money
spent
by
his
extravagant
little
daughter
ethel
saw
now
as
one
always
does
when
it
is
too
late
to
repair
damages
many
things
left
undone
which
she
ought
to
have
done
and
regretted
living
for
herself
instead
of
putting
more
pleasure
into
the
life
of
this
good
girl
whose
future
seemed
so
uninviting
to
our
young
lady
with
her
first
season
very
near
it
was
a
kind
plan
and
gratified
jenny
very
much
when
it
was
proposed
and
proved
to
her
that
no
duty
would
be
neglected
if
she
went
about
with
the
homers
and
left
her
charge
to
the
excellent
lady
who
enjoyed
chiffons
as
much
as
ethel
did
and
was
glad
to
receive
pretty
gifts
in
return
for
her
services
but
alas
for
ethel
good
resolutions
and
jenny
holiday
both
came
to
nothing
for
ethel
fell
ill
from
too
much
pastry
and
had
a
sharp
bilious
attack
which
laid
her
up
till
the
uncle
arrived
every
one
was
very
kind
and
there
was
no
danger
but
the
days
were
long
the
invalid
very
fretful
and
the
nurse
very
tired
before
the
second
week
brought
convalescence
and
a
general
cheering
and
clearing
up
took
place
uncle
sam
was
amusing
himself
very
comfortably
while
he
waited
for
his
niece
to
be
able
to
travel
and
the
girls
were
beginning
to
pack
by
degrees
for
the
accumulation
of
ethel
purchases
made
her
share
a
serious
task
there
all
are
in
now
and
only
the
steamer
trunk
is
left
to
pack
at
the
last
moment
said
jenny
folding
her
tired
arms
after
a
protracted
struggle
with
half
a
dozen
new
gowns
and
a
perplexing
medley
of
hats
boots
gloves
and
perfumery
two
large
trunks
stood
in
the
ready
to
go
the
third
was
now
done
and
nothing
remained
but
the
small
one
and
jenny
shabby
portmanteau
how
nicely
you
have
managed
i
ought
to
have
helped
only
you
would
let
me
and
i
should
have
spoilt
my
wrapper
come
and
rest
and
help
me
sort
out
this
rubbish
said
ethel
who
would
have
been
dressed
and
out
if
the
arrival
of
a
new
peignoir
had
not
kept
her
in
to
enjoy
the
lovely
pink
and
blue
thing
all
lace
and
ribbon
and
french
taste
you
will
never
get
them
into
that
box
dear
answered
jenny
gladly
sitting
down
beside
her
on
the
sofa
which
was
strewn
with
trinkets
of
all
sorts
more
or
less
damaged
by
careless
handling
and
the
vicissitudes
of
a
wandering
trunk
i
do
believe
they
are
worth
fussing
over
i
tired
of
them
and
they
look
very
mean
and
silly
after
seeing
real
jewels
here
throw
them
away
if
i
had
spent
so
much
money
on
them
said
ethel
turning
over
the
tarnished
filigree
mock
pearl
and
imitation
coral
necklaces
bracelets
and
brooches
that
were
tumbling
out
of
the
frail
boxes
in
which
they
came
they
will
look
pretty
to
people
at
home
who
have
not
been
seeing
so
many
as
we
have
i
sew
up
the
broken
cases
and
rub
up
the
silver
and
string
the
beads
and
make
all
as
good
as
new
and
you
will
find
plenty
of
girls
at
home
glad
to
get
them
i
am
sure
answered
jenny
rapidly
bringing
order
out
of
chaos
with
those
skilful
hands
of
hers
ethel
leaned
back
and
watched
her
silently
for
a
few
minutes
during
this
last
week
our
young
lady
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
and
was
conscious
of
a
strong
desire
to
tell
jane
bassett
how
much
she
loved
and
thanked
her
for
all
her
patient
and
faithful
care
during
the
six
months
now
nearly
over
but
she
was
proud
and
humility
was
hard
to
learn
was
sweet
and
to
own
one
self
in
the
wrong
a
most
distasteful
task
the
penitent
did
not
know
how
to
begin
so
waited
for
an
opportunity
and
presently
it
came
shall
you
be
glad
to
get
home
jenny
she
asked
in
her
most
caressing
tone
as
she
hung
her
prettiest
locket
round
her
neck
for
during
this
illness
all
formality
and
coolness
had
melted
away
and
miss
bassett
was
jenny
dear
now
i
shall
be
very
very
glad
to
see
my
precious
people
again
and
tell
them
all
about
my
splendid
holiday
but
i
ca
help
wishing
that
we
were
to
stay
till
spring
now
that
we
are
here
and
i
have
no
teaching
and
may
never
get
such
another
chance
i
afraid
it
seems
ungrateful
when
i
had
so
much
but
to
go
back
without
seeing
rome
is
a
trial
i
confess
answered
honest
jane
rubbing
away
at
a
very
dull
paste
bandeau
so
it
is
but
i
do
mind
so
much
because
i
shall
come
again
and
i
mean
to
be
better
prepared
to
enjoy
things
properly
than
i
am
now
i
really
study
this
winter
and
not
be
such
a
fool
jenny
i
a
plan
in
my
head
i
wonder
if
you
like
it
i
should
immensely
and
i
going
to
propose
it
to
mamma
the
minute
i
get
home
said
ethel
glad
to
seize
this
opening
what
is
it
deary
would
you
like
to
be
my
governess
and
teach
me
all
you
know
quietly
at
home
this
winter
i
do
want
to
begin
school
again
just
for
languages
and
a
few
finishing
things
and
i
really
think
you
would
do
more
for
me
than
any
one
else
because
you
know
what
i
need
and
are
so
patient
with
your
bad
ungrateful
saucy
girl
could
you
would
you
come
and
ethel
put
her
arms
round
neck
with
a
little
sob
and
a
kiss
that
was
far
more
precious
to
jane
than
the
famous
diamond
necklace
of
marie
antoinette
which
she
had
been
reading
about
i
could
and
i
would
with
all
my
heart
if
you
want
me
darling
i
think
we
know
and
love
each
other
now
and
can
be
happy
and
helpful
together
and
i
come
so
gladly
if
your
mother
asks
me
answered
jenny
quick
to
understand
what
underlay
this
sudden
tenderness
and
glad
to
accept
the
atonement
offered
her
for
many
trials
which
she
would
never
have
told
even
to
her
own
mother
ethel
was
her
best
self
now
and
her
friend
felt
well
rewarded
for
the
past
by
this
promise
of
real
love
and
mutual
help
in
the
future
so
they
talked
over
the
new
plan
in
great
spirits
till
homer
came
to
bring
them
their
share
of
a
packet
of
home
letters
just
arrived
she
saw
that
something
unusual
was
going
on
but
only
smiled
nodded
and
went
away
saying
i
have
good
news
in
my
letters
and
hope
yours
will
make
you
equally
happy
silence
reigned
for
a
time
as
they
sat
reading
busily
then
a
sudden
exclamation
from
ethel
seemed
to
produce
a
strange
effect
upon
jenny
for
with
a
cry
of
joy
she
sprang
up
and
danced
all
over
the
room
waving
her
letter
wildly
as
she
cried
out
i
to
go
i
to
go
i
ca
believe
it
but
here
it
is
how
kind
how
very
kind
every
one
is
to
me
and
down
she
went
upon
her
own
little
bed
to
hide
her
face
and
laugh
and
cry
till
ethel
ran
to
rejoice
with
her
oh
jenny
i
so
glad
you
deserve
it
and
it
like
homer
to
make
all
smooth
before
she
said
a
word
let
me
read
what
mamma
writes
to
you
here
my
letter
see
how
sweetly
she
speaks
of
you
and
how
grateful
they
are
for
all
you
done
for
the
letters
changed
hands
and
sitting
side
by
side
in
an
affectionate
bunch
the
girls
read
the
happy
news
that
granted
the
cherished
wish
of
one
and
gave
the
other
real
unselfish
pleasure
in
another
happiness
jane
was
to
go
to
rome
with
the
homers
for
the
winter
and
perhaps
to
greece
in
the
spring
a
year
of
delight
lay
before
her
offered
in
such
a
friendly
way
and
with
such
words
of
commendation
thanks
and
welcome
that
the
girl
heart
was
full
and
she
felt
that
every
small
sacrifice
of
feeling
every
lonely
hour
and
distasteful
duty
was
richly
repaid
by
this
rare
opportunity
to
enjoy
still
further
draughts
of
the
wisdom
beauty
and
poetry
of
the
wonderful
world
now
open
to
her
she
flew
off
presently
to
try
to
thank
her
good
friends
and
came
back
dragging
a
light
new
trunk
in
which
she
nearly
buried
her
small
self
as
she
excitedly
explained
its
appearance
while
rattling
out
the
trays
and
displaying
its
many
conveniences
that
dear
woman
says
i
to
send
my
presents
home
in
the
old
one
by
you
and
take
this
to
fill
up
in
rome
think
of
it
a
lovely
new
french
trunk
and
rome
full
of
pictures
statues
peter
and
the
colosseum
it
takes
my
breath
away
and
makes
my
head
so
i
see
it
a
capital
box
but
it
wo
hold
even
peter
dear
so
you
better
calm
down
and
pack
your
treasures
i
help
cried
ethel
sweeping
about
in
her
gay
gown
almost
as
wild
as
jane
who
was
quite
upset
by
this
sudden
delicious
change
in
her
prospects
how
happily
she
laid
away
in
the
old
trunk
the
few
gifts
she
had
ventured
to
buy
and
those
given
her
the
glossy
silk
the
dainty
lace
the
pretty
crystals
the
store
of
gloves
the
flask
of
cologne
the
pictures
and
books
and
last
of
all
the
sketches
which
illustrated
the
journal
kept
so
carefully
for
those
at
home
now
when
my
letter
is
written
and
the
check
with
all
that
is
left
of
my
salary
put
in
i
am
done
there
room
for
more
and
i
wish
i
got
something
else
now
i
feel
so
rich
but
it
is
foolish
to
buy
gowns
to
pay
duties
on
when
i
do
know
what
the
girls
need
i
feel
so
rich
now
i
shall
fly
out
and
pick
up
some
more
little
pretties
for
the
dears
they
have
so
few
anything
will
be
charming
to
them
said
jenny
proudly
surveying
her
box
and
looking
about
for
some
foreign
trifle
with
which
to
fill
up
the
corners
then
let
me
put
these
in
and
so
be
rid
of
them
i
shall
go
to
see
your
people
and
tell
them
all
about
you
and
explain
how
you
came
to
send
so
much
as
she
spoke
ethel
slipped
in
several
swiss
carvings
the
best
of
the
trinkets
and
a
parcel
of
dainty
parisian
ties
and
sashes
which
would
gladden
the
hearts
of
the
poor
pretty
girls
just
beginning
to
need
such
aids
to
their
modest
toilets
a
big
box
of
bonbons
completed
her
contribution
and
left
but
one
empty
corner
i
tuck
in
my
old
hat
to
keep
all
steady
the
girls
will
like
it
when
they
dress
up
and
i
fond
of
it
because
it
recalls
some
of
my
happiest
days
said
jenny
as
she
took
up
the
hat
and
began
to
dust
it
a
shower
of
grain
dropped
into
her
hand
for
the
yellow
wheat
still
kept
its
place
and
recalled
the
chat
at
schwalbach
ethel
glanced
at
her
own
hat
with
its
faded
artificial
flowers
and
as
her
eye
went
from
the
small
store
of
treasures
so
carefully
and
happily
gathered
to
the
strew
of
almost
useless
finery
on
her
bed
she
said
soberly
you
were
right
jenny
my
poppies
are
worthless
and
my
harvest
a
very
poor
one
your
wheat
fell
in
good
ground
and
you
will
glean
a
whole
stack
before
you
go
home
well
i
shall
keep
my
old
hat
to
remind
me
of
you
and
when
i
come
again
i
hope
i
shall
have
a
wiser
head
to
put
into
a
new
little
if
you
please
i
come
said
a
small
girl
as
she
walked
into
a
large
room
where
three
ladies
sat
at
work
one
of
the
ladies
was
very
thin
one
very
stout
and
the
youngest
very
pretty
the
eldest
put
on
her
glasses
the
stout
one
dropped
her
sewing
and
the
pretty
one
exclaimed
why
it
must
be
little
rosamond
yes
i
come
the
man
is
taking
my
trunk
upstairs
and
i
got
a
letter
for
cousin
penelope
said
the
child
with
the
sweet
composure
of
one
always
sure
of
a
welcome
the
stout
lady
held
out
her
hand
for
the
letter
but
the
little
girl
after
a
keen
look
at
the
three
faces
went
to
the
old
lady
who
received
her
with
a
kiss
saying
that
right
but
how
did
you
know
dear
oh
papa
said
cousin
penny
is
old
cousin
henny
fat
and
cousin
cicely
rather
pretty
so
i
knew
in
one
minute
replied
rosamond
in
a
tone
of
innocent
satisfaction
at
her
own
cleverness
and
quite
unconscious
of
the
effect
of
her
speech
miss
penelope
hastily
retired
behind
the
letter
miss
henrietta
frowned
so
heavily
that
the
flew
off
her
nose
with
a
clash
and
cicely
laughed
outright
as
she
exclaimed
i
afraid
we
have
got
an
enfant
terrible
among
us
though
i
complain
of
my
share
of
the
i
never
expected
to
find
clara
child
well
mannered
and
i
see
i
was
quite
right
take
your
hat
off
rosamond
and
sit
down
it
tires
sister
to
lean
on
her
in
that
way
said
miss
henny
in
a
severe
tone
with
no
offer
of
any
warmer
welcome
seeing
that
something
was
amiss
the
child
quietly
obeyed
and
perching
herself
in
an
ancient
crossed
her
short
legs
folded
her
plump
hands
over
the
diminutive
she
carried
and
sat
looking
about
the
room
with
a
pair
of
very
large
blue
eyes
quite
unabashed
though
rather
pensive
as
if
the
memory
of
some
tender
parting
were
still
fresh
in
her
little
heart
while
miss
penny
slowly
reads
the
letter
miss
henny
works
daisies
on
a
bit
of
canvas
with
pettish
jerks
of
her
silk
and
miss
cicely
leans
in
the
staring
at
the
newcomer
we
will
briefly
introduce
our
small
heroine
her
father
was
cousin
to
the
elder
ladies
and
being
called
suddenly
across
the
water
on
business
took
his
wife
with
him
leaving
the
little
girl
to
the
care
of
these
relatives
thinking
her
too
young
for
so
long
a
journey
cicely
an
orphan
niece
who
lived
with
the
old
ladies
was
to
have
the
care
of
rosy
and
a
summer
in
the
quiet
country
town
would
do
her
good
while
change
of
scene
would
console
her
for
this
first
separation
from
her
mother
how
she
fared
remains
to
be
seen
and
we
need
only
add
that
the
child
had
been
well
trained
made
the
companion
of
a
sweet
and
tender
woman
and
was
very
anxious
to
please
the
parents
whom
she
passionately
loved
by
keeping
the
promises
she
had
made
them
and
being
as
brave
as
papa
as
patient
and
kind
as
dear
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
missy
asked
cicely
as
the
blue
eyes
came
back
to
her
after
roving
round
the
spacious
and
rather
gloomy
room
it
a
pretty
large
dark
place
for
a
little
girl
to
be
all
alone
in
and
there
was
a
suspicious
quiver
in
the
childish
voice
as
rosy
opened
her
bag
to
produce
a
very
small
handkerchief
evidently
feeling
that
she
might
have
sudden
need
of
it
if
some
one
did
not
speak
to
her
very
soon
we
keep
it
dark
on
account
of
sister
eyes
when
was
a
little
girl
it
was
considered
polite
to
say
rude
things
about
other
people
houses
especially
if
they
were
very
handsome
ones
said
miss
henny
with
a
stern
glance
over
the
at
the
young
offender
whose
second
remark
was
even
more
unfortunate
than
her
first
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
but
i
must
tell
the
truth
little
girls
like
bright
places
i
sorry
about
cousin
penny
eyes
i
will
read
to
her
i
do
to
mamma
and
she
says
it
is
very
well
for
a
child
only
eight
years
the
gentle
answer
and
the
full
eyes
seemed
to
calm
miss
wrath
for
her
size
was
her
tender
point
and
the
old
house
her
especial
pride
so
she
dropped
the
glasses
and
said
more
kindly
there
is
a
nice
little
room
ready
for
you
upstairs
and
a
garden
to
play
in
cicely
will
hear
you
read
every
day
and
i
will
teach
you
to
sew
for
of
course
that
most
useful
part
of
your
education
has
been
no
i
sew
my
four
patches
every
day
and
make
little
wee
stitches
and
i
can
hem
papa
and
i
was
learning
to
darn
his
socks
with
a
big
needle
when
when
they
went
rosy
paused
with
a
sudden
choke
but
too
proud
to
break
down
she
only
wiped
two
drops
off
her
cheek
with
the
long
ends
of
her
little
gray
silk
glove
set
her
lips
and
remained
mistress
of
herself
privately
planning
to
cry
all
she
liked
when
she
was
safely
in
the
nice
little
room
promised
her
cicely
though
a
lazy
selfish
young
lady
was
touched
by
the
child
pathetic
face
and
said
in
a
friendly
tone
as
she
patted
the
couch
where
she
lay
come
here
dear
and
sit
by
me
and
tell
me
what
kind
of
a
kitten
you
like
best
i
know
of
a
sweet
yellow
one
and
two
grays
our
tabby
is
too
old
to
play
with
you
so
you
will
want
a
kitty
oh
yes
if
i
may
and
rosy
skipped
to
the
new
seat
with
a
smile
which
plainly
proved
that
this
sort
of
welcome
was
just
what
she
liked
now
cicely
why
will
you
put
such
an
idea
into
rosamond
head
when
you
know
we
ca
have
kittens
round
the
house
for
sister
to
stumble
over
not
to
mention
the
mischief
the
horrid
things
always
do
tabby
is
all
the
child
needs
with
her
doll
of
course
you
have
a
doll
and
miss
henny
asked
the
question
as
solemnly
as
if
she
had
said
have
you
a
soul
oh
yes
i
have
nine
in
my
trunk
and
two
little
ones
in
my
bag
and
mamma
is
going
to
send
me
a
big
big
one
from
london
as
soon
as
she
gets
there
to
sleep
with
me
and
be
my
little
comfort
cried
rosy
rapidly
producing
from
her
bag
a
tiny
bride
and
groom
three
a
and
a
purse
out
of
which
fell
a
shower
of
bright
cents
also
crumbs
all
over
the
immaculate
carpet
mercy
on
us
what
a
mess
pick
it
all
up
child
and
do
unpack
any
more
in
the
parlor
one
doll
is
quite
enough
for
me
said
miss
henny
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
as
if
asking
patience
to
bear
this
new
calamity
rosy
echoed
the
sigh
as
she
crept
about
reclaiming
her
precious
pennies
and
eating
the
crumbs
as
the
only
way
of
disposing
of
them
never
mind
it
only
her
way
the
heat
makes
her
a
little
cross
you
see
whispered
cicely
bending
down
to
hold
the
bag
into
which
rosy
bundled
her
treasures
in
hot
haste
i
thought
fat
people
were
always
pleasant
i
glad
you
ai
fat
answered
the
little
girl
in
a
tone
which
was
perfectly
audible
what
would
have
happened
i
tremble
to
think
if
miss
penny
had
not
finished
the
letter
at
that
moment
and
handed
it
to
her
sister
saying
as
she
held
out
her
arms
to
the
child
now
i
know
all
about
it
and
you
are
to
be
my
baby
so
come
and
give
me
some
sweet
kisses
down
dropped
the
bag
and
with
a
little
sob
of
joy
the
child
nestled
close
to
the
kind
old
heart
that
welcomed
her
so
tenderly
at
last
papa
calls
me
his
i
so
small
and
pink
and
sweet
and
thorny
too
sometimes
she
said
looking
up
brightly
after
a
few
moments
of
the
fond
and
foolish
cuddling
all
little
creatures
love
and
need
so
much
when
they
leave
the
nest
and
miss
the
brooding
of
motherly
wings
we
call
you
anything
you
like
darling
but
rosamond
is
a
pretty
old
name
and
i
fond
of
it
for
it
was
your
grandmamma
and
a
sweeter
woman
never
lived
said
miss
penny
stroking
the
fresh
cheeks
where
the
tears
shone
like
dew
on
pink
i
shall
call
you
chicken
little
because
we
have
henny
and
penny
and
the
girls
and
tab
downstairs
can
be
and
i
be
and
i
sure
lives
next
door
said
cicely
laughing
at
her
own
wit
while
miss
henny
looked
up
saying
with
the
first
smile
rosy
had
seen
that
true
enough
and
i
hope
chicken
little
will
keep
out
of
his
way
no
matter
if
the
sky
does
who
is
it
a
truly
fox
i
never
saw
one
could
i
peep
at
him
sometimes
cried
the
child
much
interested
at
once
no
dear
it
only
a
neighbor
of
ours
who
has
treated
us
badly
at
least
we
think
so
and
we
do
speak
though
we
used
to
be
good
friends
some
years
ago
it
sad
to
live
so
but
we
do
quite
see
how
to
help
it
yet
we
are
ready
to
do
our
part
but
dover
should
take
the
first
step
as
he
was
in
the
please
tell
about
it
i
have
horrid
quarrels
with
mamie
parsons
sometimes
but
we
always
kiss
and
make
up
and
feel
all
happy
again
ca
you
cousin
penny
asked
the
child
softly
touching
the
little
white
curls
under
the
lace
cap
well
no
dear
grown
people
can
not
settle
differences
in
that
pretty
way
we
must
wait
till
he
apologizes
and
then
we
shall
gladly
be
friends
again
you
see
dover
was
a
missionary
in
india
for
many
years
and
we
were
very
intimate
with
his
mother
our
gardens
join
and
a
gate
in
our
fence
led
across
their
field
to
the
back
street
and
was
most
convenient
when
we
wanted
to
walk
by
the
river
or
send
the
maids
on
errands
in
a
hurry
the
old
lady
was
very
neighborly
and
we
were
quite
comfortable
till
thomas
came
home
and
made
trouble
he
lost
his
wife
and
children
poor
man
and
his
liver
was
out
of
order
and
living
among
the
heathen
so
long
had
made
him
melancholy
and
queer
so
he
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
gardening
and
keeping
i
glad
i
love
flowers
and
biddies
murmured
rosy
listening
with
deep
interest
to
this
delightful
mixture
of
quarrels
and
heathen
sorrow
poultry
mysterious
diseases
and
gardens
he
had
no
right
to
shut
up
our
gate
and
forbid
our
crossing
that
little
field
and
no
gentleman
would
have
dared
to
do
it
after
all
our
kindness
to
his
mother
exclaimed
miss
henny
so
suddenly
and
violently
that
rosamond
nearly
fell
off
the
old
lady
lap
with
the
start
she
gave
no
sister
i
do
agree
there
thomas
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
as
he
liked
with
his
own
land
but
i
think
we
should
have
had
no
trouble
if
you
had
been
willing
to
sell
him
the
corner
of
our
garden
where
the
old
is
for
his
hens
began
miss
penny
in
a
mild
tone
sister
you
know
the
tender
memories
connected
with
that
bower
and
how
terrible
it
would
have
been
to
me
to
see
it
torn
down
and
noisy
fowls
clucking
and
pecking
where
i
and
my
poor
calvin
once
sat
together
cried
miss
henny
trying
to
look
sentimental
which
was
an
impossible
feat
for
a
stout
lady
in
a
flowery
muslin
gown
and
a
cap
full
of
blue
ribbons
on
a
head
once
flaxen
and
now
gray
we
wo
discuss
the
point
henrietta
said
the
elder
lady
with
dignity
whereupon
the
other
returned
to
the
letter
bridling
and
tossing
her
head
in
a
way
which
caused
rosy
to
stare
and
resolve
to
imitate
it
when
she
played
being
a
proud
princess
with
her
dolls
well
dear
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
continued
miss
penny
and
now
we
do
speak
and
the
old
lady
misses
us
sure
and
i
often
long
to
run
in
and
see
her
and
i
so
sorry
you
ca
enjoy
the
wonders
of
that
house
for
it
full
of
beautiful
and
curious
things
most
instructive
for
children
to
observe
thomas
has
been
a
great
traveller
and
has
a
tiger
skin
in
the
parlor
so
natural
it
quite
startling
to
behold
also
spears
and
bows
and
arrows
and
necklaces
of
shark
teeth
from
the
cannibal
islands
and
the
loveliest
stuffed
birds
my
dear
all
over
the
place
and
pretty
shells
and
baskets
and
ivory
toys
and
odd
dresses
and
no
end
of
wonderful
treasures
such
a
sad
pity
you
ca
see
them
and
miss
penny
looked
quite
distressed
at
the
child
loss
oh
but
i
guess
i
will
see
every
one
is
good
to
me
and
old
gentlemen
like
little
girls
papa
says
so
and
he
always
does
what
i
want
when
i
say
with
my
wheedulin
smile
as
he
calls
it
said
rosy
giving
them
a
sample
of
the
most
engaging
sort
you
funny
little
thing
do
try
it
and
soften
the
heart
of
that
tiresome
man
he
has
the
finest
roses
in
town
and
the
most
delicious
fruit
and
we
never
get
any
though
he
sends
quantities
everywhere
else
such
a
fuss
over
an
old
arbor
it
is
perfectly
provoking
when
we
might
enjoy
so
much
over
there
and
who
knows
what
might
happen
as
cicely
spoke
she
smoothed
her
brown
curls
and
glanced
at
the
mirror
quite
conscious
that
a
very
pretty
young
lady
of
twenty
was
wasting
her
sweetness
in
the
great
gloomy
house
with
two
elderly
spinsters
i
get
some
for
you
answered
rosy
with
a
nod
of
such
calm
conviction
of
her
own
power
that
cicely
laughed
again
and
proposed
that
she
should
go
at
once
and
view
the
could
i
run
in
the
garden
i
love
to
after
riding
so
long
asked
rosy
eager
to
be
off
for
her
active
legs
ached
for
exercise
and
the
close
shady
room
oppressed
her
yes
dear
but
do
get
into
mischief
or
worry
tabby
or
pick
the
flowers
of
course
you
would
touch
green
fruit
or
climb
trees
or
soil
your
little
frock
i
ring
the
bell
for
you
to
come
in
and
be
dressed
for
tea
when
it
is
with
these
directions
and
a
kiss
miss
penny
as
cicely
did
not
stir
let
the
child
out
at
the
back
door
of
the
long
hall
and
watched
her
walk
demurely
down
the
main
path
of
the
prim
old
garden
where
no
child
had
played
for
years
and
even
the
toads
and
fat
robins
behaved
in
the
most
decorous
manner
it
pretty
dull
but
it
better
than
the
parlor
with
all
the
staring
pictures
said
rosy
to
herself
after
a
voyage
of
discovery
had
shown
her
the
few
charms
of
the
place
the
sight
of
a
large
yellow
cat
reposing
in
the
sun
cheered
her
eyes
at
that
moment
and
she
hastened
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
the
stately
animal
for
the
snails
were
not
social
and
the
toads
stared
even
more
fixedly
at
her
than
the
painted
eyes
of
her
respected
ancestors
but
tabby
disliked
children
as
much
as
her
mistress
and
after
submitting
ungraciously
to
a
few
caresses
from
the
eager
little
hands
she
rose
and
retired
majestically
to
a
safer
perch
on
the
top
of
the
high
wall
which
enclosed
the
garden
being
too
lazy
to
jump
she
walked
up
the
shelves
of
an
old
moulding
in
a
corner
and
by
so
doing
gave
rosy
a
brilliant
idea
which
she
at
once
put
into
action
by
following
tabby
example
up
this
new
sort
of
ladder
she
went
and
peeped
over
the
wall
delighted
at
this
unexpected
chance
to
behold
the
enemy
territory
oh
what
a
pretty
place
she
cried
clasping
her
grubby
little
hands
with
rapture
as
the
beauties
of
the
forbidden
land
burst
upon
her
view
it
was
indeed
a
paradise
to
a
child
eyes
for
flowers
bloomed
along
the
winding
paths
ripening
fruit
lay
rosy
and
tempting
in
the
beds
below
behind
the
wire
walls
that
confined
them
clucked
and
strutted
various
sorts
of
poultry
cages
of
gay
birds
hung
on
the
piazza
and
through
the
open
windows
of
the
house
one
caught
glimpses
of
curious
curtains
bright
weapons
and
mysterious
objects
in
the
rooms
beyond
a
gentleman
in
a
queer
nankeen
coat
lay
asleep
on
a
bamboo
lounge
under
the
great
with
a
purple
silk
handkerchief
half
over
his
face
that
the
missionary
man
i
he
does
look
cross
at
all
if
i
could
only
get
down
there
i
go
and
wake
him
with
a
softly
kiss
as
i
do
papa
and
ask
to
see
his
pretty
being
quite
unconscious
of
fear
rosy
certainly
would
have
carried
out
her
daring
plan
had
it
been
possible
but
no
way
of
descending
on
the
other
side
appeared
so
she
sighed
and
sat
gazing
wistfully
till
cousin
henny
appeared
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
ordered
her
down
at
once
come
and
see
if
my
have
started
yet
i
keep
planting
them
but
they
wo
come
up
she
said
pointing
out
a
mound
of
earth
newly
dug
and
watered
rosy
obediently
scrambled
up
and
was
trying
to
decide
whether
some
green
sprouts
were
chickweed
or
the
dilatory
balsams
when
a
sudden
uproar
in
the
next
garden
made
her
stop
to
listen
while
miss
henny
said
in
a
tone
of
great
satisfaction
as
the
cackle
of
hens
arose
some
trouble
with
those
horrid
fowls
of
his
i
detest
them
crowing
in
the
night
and
waking
us
at
dawn
with
their
noise
i
wish
some
thief
would
steal
every
one
of
them
nobody
has
a
right
to
annoy
their
neighbors
with
troublesome
before
rosy
could
describe
the
beauties
of
the
white
bantams
or
the
size
of
the
big
golden
cock
a
loud
voice
cried
you
rascal
i
hang
you
if
i
catch
you
here
again
go
home
quicker
than
you
came
and
tell
your
mistress
to
teach
you
better
manners
if
she
values
your
it
that
man
such
language
i
wonder
who
he
caught
that
bad
boy
who
steals
our
plums
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
miss
henny
mouth
when
her
question
was
answered
in
a
sudden
and
dreadful
way
for
over
the
wall
hurled
by
a
strong
arm
flew
tabby
high
in
the
air
to
fall
with
a
thump
directly
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
where
they
stood
miss
henny
uttered
a
shrill
scream
caught
up
her
stunned
treasure
and
rushed
into
the
house
as
fast
as
her
size
and
flounces
permitted
leaving
rosy
breathless
with
surprise
and
indignation
burning
to
resent
this
terrible
outrage
she
climbed
quickly
up
the
steps
and
astonished
the
irate
old
gentleman
on
the
other
side
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
golden
head
a
red
childish
face
and
a
dirty
little
finger
pointed
sternly
at
him
as
this
small
avenging
angel
demanded
missionary
man
how
could
you
kill
my
cousin
cat
bless
my
soul
who
are
you
said
the
old
gentleman
staring
at
this
unexpected
actor
on
the
field
of
battle
i
and
i
hate
cruel
people
tabby
dead
and
now
there
is
any
one
to
play
with
over
this
sad
prospect
made
the
blue
eyes
fill
with
sudden
tears
and
the
application
of
the
dirty
fingers
added
streaks
of
mud
to
the
red
cheeks
which
much
damaged
the
appearance
of
the
angel
thought
it
added
pathos
to
the
child
reproach
cats
have
nine
lives
and
tabby
used
to
being
chucked
over
the
wall
i
done
it
several
times
and
it
seems
to
agree
with
her
for
she
comes
back
to
kill
my
chicks
as
bold
as
brass
see
that
and
the
old
gentleman
held
up
a
downy
dead
chicken
as
proof
of
tabby
sin
poor
little
chicky
groaned
rosy
yearning
to
mourn
over
the
dear
departed
and
bury
it
with
tender
care
it
was
very
naughty
of
tab
but
sir
you
know
cats
are
made
to
catch
things
and
they
help
they
will
have
to
help
it
or
i
drown
the
lot
this
is
a
rare
breed
and
i
but
two
left
after
all
my
trouble
thanks
to
that
rascal
of
yours
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
demanded
dover
in
a
tone
that
made
rosy
feel
as
if
she
had
committed
the
murder
herself
i
talk
to
tabby
and
try
to
make
her
good
and
i
shut
her
up
in
the
old
over
here
then
i
hope
she
will
be
sorry
and
never
do
it
any
more
she
said
in
such
a
remorseful
tone
that
the
old
gentleman
relented
at
once
ashamed
to
afflict
such
a
tender
little
soul
try
it
he
said
with
a
smile
that
made
his
yellow
face
pleasant
all
at
once
then
as
if
ready
to
change
the
subject
he
asked
looking
curiously
at
the
little
figure
perched
on
the
wall
where
did
you
come
from
never
saw
any
children
over
there
before
they
do
allow
rosy
introduced
herself
in
a
few
words
and
seeing
that
her
new
acquaintance
seemed
interested
she
added
with
the
wheedling
smile
papa
found
so
engaging
it
pretty
lonely
here
i
guess
so
you
let
me
peep
at
your
nice
garden
sometimes
if
it
does
trouble
you
sir
poor
little
soul
it
must
be
desperately
dull
with
those
three
tabbies
he
said
to
himself
as
he
stroked
the
dead
chicken
in
his
hand
and
watched
the
little
face
bent
toward
him
peep
as
much
as
you
like
child
or
better
still
come
over
and
run
about
like
little
girls
he
added
aloud
with
a
nod
and
a
wave
of
welcome
i
told
i
was
sure
you
did
i
love
to
come
but
they
let
me
i
know
i
so
sorry
about
the
fight
could
you
make
it
up
and
be
pleasant
again
asked
rosy
clasping
her
hands
with
a
beseeching
gesture
as
her
bright
face
grew
sad
and
serious
remembering
the
feud
so
they
told
you
that
nonsense
already
have
they
nice
neighbors
they
are
said
the
old
gentleman
frowning
as
if
ill
pleased
at
the
news
i
glad
i
know
i
can
be
a
mamma
says
they
are
good
to
have
in
families
and
i
like
to
be
one
if
i
could
would
you
mind
if
i
tried
to
a
little
so
i
could
come
over
i
do
want
to
see
the
red
birds
and
the
tiger
skin
awfully
if
you
what
do
you
know
about
asked
the
old
gentleman
sitting
down
on
a
garden
chair
as
if
he
did
mind
continuing
the
chat
with
this
new
neighbor
nearly
tumbling
off
the
wall
in
her
earnestness
rosy
repeated
all
that
cousin
penny
had
said
and
something
in
the
reasonable
words
the
flattering
description
of
his
treasures
and
the
sincere
regret
of
the
old
lady
seemed
to
have
a
good
effect
upon
dover
for
when
rosy
paused
out
of
breath
he
said
in
such
an
altered
tone
that
it
was
evident
the
peacemaking
had
already
begun
miss
carey
is
a
gentlewoman
i
always
thought
so
you
tell
her
with
my
compliments
that
i
be
glad
to
see
you
any
time
if
she
has
no
objection
i
put
my
there
and
you
can
come
over
instead
of
the
cat
but
mind
you
do
meddle
or
i
might
give
you
a
toss
like
i
not
afraid
laughed
rosy
i
go
and
ask
right
away
and
i
wo
touch
a
thing
and
i
know
you
like
me
for
a
friend
papa
says
i
a
dear
little
one
thank
you
very
much
sir
till
i
come
again
and
with
a
kiss
of
the
hand
the
yellow
head
sunk
out
of
sight
like
the
sun
going
down
leaving
a
sense
of
darkness
behind
when
the
beaming
little
face
disappeared
though
fresh
stains
of
green
mould
from
the
wall
made
it
rather
like
the
tattooed
countenances
dover
used
to
see
among
his
cannibal
friends
in
africa
he
sat
musing
with
the
dead
chicken
in
his
hand
forgetful
of
time
till
a
ring
of
his
own
called
him
in
to
receive
a
note
from
miss
penelope
thanking
him
for
his
invitation
to
little
rosamond
but
declining
it
in
the
most
polite
and
formal
words
i
expected
it
bless
the
silly
old
souls
why
ca
they
be
reasonable
and
accept
the
olive
branch
when
i
offer
it
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
again
the
fat
one
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
miss
pen
would
give
in
if
that
absurd
henrietta
did
hold
her
back
well
i
sorry
for
the
child
but
that
not
my
fault
and
throwing
down
the
note
he
went
out
to
water
his
roses
for
a
week
or
two
hardly
dared
glance
toward
the
forbidden
spot
from
her
window
as
she
was
ordered
to
play
in
the
front
garden
and
sent
to
take
sober
walks
with
cicely
who
loved
to
stop
and
gossip
with
her
friends
while
the
poor
child
waited
patiently
till
the
long
tales
were
told
nursing
tabby
was
her
chief
consolation
and
so
kind
was
she
that
the
heart
of
the
old
cat
softened
to
her
and
she
actually
purred
her
thanks
at
last
for
all
the
saucers
of
cream
bits
of
chicken
soft
pats
and
tender
words
bestowed
upon
her
by
the
little
girl
well
i
declare
tab
wo
do
that
even
for
me
said
miss
henny
one
day
when
she
came
upon
the
child
sitting
alone
in
the
hall
with
a
and
the
cat
comfortably
asleep
in
her
lap
ammals
always
love
me
if
people
do
answered
soberly
for
she
had
not
yet
forgiven
the
stout
lady
for
denying
her
the
delights
offered
by
the
missionary
that
because
ca
see
how
naughty
you
are
sometimes
said
miss
henny
tartly
not
having
recovered
her
temper
even
after
many
days
i
shall
make
every
one
love
me
before
i
go
away
mamma
told
me
to
and
i
shall
i
know
how
and
button
smiled
with
a
wise
little
nod
that
was
pretty
to
see
as
she
proudly
cuddled
her
first
conquest
we
shall
see
and
miss
henny
ponderously
departed
wondering
what
odd
fancy
the
little
thing
would
take
into
her
head
next
it
was
soon
evident
for
when
she
came
down
from
her
long
nap
later
in
the
afternoon
miss
henny
found
rosamond
reading
aloud
to
her
sister
in
the
great
dim
parlor
they
made
a
curious
contrast
the
pale
feeble
old
lady
with
her
prim
dress
high
cap
knitting
and
shaded
eyes
and
the
child
rosy
and
round
quaint
and
sweet
a
pretty
little
ornament
for
the
room
as
she
sat
among
the
and
samplers
ancient
china
and
furniture
with
the
portraits
of
great
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
simpering
and
staring
at
her
as
if
pleased
and
surprised
to
see
such
a
charming
little
descendant
among
them
bless
the
baby
what
is
she
at
now
asked
miss
henny
feeling
more
amiable
after
her
sleep
i
reading
to
cousin
penny
no
one
else
does
and
her
poor
eyes
hurt
her
and
she
likes
stories
and
so
do
i
answered
button
with
one
chubby
finger
on
the
place
in
her
book
and
eyes
full
of
pride
at
the
employment
she
had
found
for
herself
so
kind
of
the
little
dear
she
found
me
alone
and
wanted
to
amuse
me
so
i
proposed
a
story
to
suit
us
both
and
she
does
very
well
with
a
little
help
now
and
then
i
have
read
susan
for
years
and
really
enjoy
it
maria
edgeworth
was
always
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
still
think
her
far
superior
to
any
modern
writer
for
the
young
said
miss
penny
looking
quite
animated
and
happy
in
the
new
entertainment
provided
for
her
go
on
child
let
me
hear
how
well
you
can
read
and
miss
henny
settled
herself
in
the
with
her
embroidery
so
button
started
bravely
on
and
tried
so
hard
that
she
was
soon
out
of
breath
as
she
paused
she
said
with
a
gasp
is
susan
a
dear
girl
she
gives
all
the
best
things
to
other
people
and
is
kind
to
the
old
harper
she
did
send
him
away
as
you
did
the
and
tell
him
to
be
organs
are
a
nuisance
and
i
never
allow
them
here
go
on
and
do
criticise
your
elders
mamma
and
i
always
talk
over
stories
and
pick
out
the
morals
of
she
likes
it
with
which
remark
made
sweetly
not
pertly
button
went
on
to
the
end
with
an
occasional
lift
over
a
long
word
and
the
old
ladies
were
interested
in
spite
of
themselves
in
the
simple
tale
read
in
that
childish
voice
thank
you
dear
it
is
very
nice
and
we
will
have
one
every
day
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
asked
miss
penny
as
the
little
girl
pushed
the
curls
off
her
forehead
with
a
sigh
of
mingled
weariness
and
satisfaction
let
me
go
in
the
back
garden
and
peep
through
the
at
the
pretty
roses
i
do
long
to
see
if
the
moss
ones
are
out
and
the
cherries
ripe
said
rosy
clasping
her
hands
imploringly
it
can
do
no
harm
henrietta
yes
dear
run
away
and
get
some
catnip
for
tabby
and
see
if
the
balsams
are
up
that
last
suggestion
won
miss
henny
consent
and
button
was
off
at
once
skipping
like
a
young
colt
all
over
the
garden
which
now
seemed
delightful
to
her
at
the
back
of
the
was
a
narrow
space
between
it
and
the
fence
where
certain
plump
toads
lived
peeping
in
to
watch
them
rosy
had
spied
a
large
in
the
old
boards
and
through
it
found
she
could
get
a
fine
view
of
several
a
tree
and
one
window
of
the
missionary
man
house
she
had
longed
for
another
peep
since
the
was
gone
and
climbing
trees
forbidden
now
with
joy
she
slipped
into
the
damp
nook
regardless
of
the
speckled
gentlemen
who
stared
at
her
with
dismay
and
took
a
good
look
at
the
forbidden
paradise
beyond
yes
the
moss
ones
were
in
bloom
the
cherries
quite
red
and
at
the
window
was
the
gray
head
of
dover
as
he
sat
reading
in
his
queer
yellow
button
yearned
to
get
in
and
leaned
so
hard
against
the
hateful
fence
that
the
rotten
board
cracked
a
long
bit
fell
out
and
she
nearly
went
after
it
as
it
dropped
upon
the
green
bank
below
now
the
full
splendor
of
the
roses
burst
upon
her
and
a
delightful
gooseberry
bush
stood
close
by
with
purplish
berries
temptingly
bobbing
within
reach
this
obliging
bush
hid
the
hole
but
left
fine
openings
to
see
through
so
the
child
popped
her
curly
head
out
and
gazed
delightedly
at
the
chickens
the
flowers
the
fruit
and
the
unconscious
old
gentleman
not
far
away
i
have
it
for
my
secret
or
maybe
i
tell
cousin
penny
and
beg
her
to
let
me
peep
if
i
truly
promise
never
to
go
in
thought
button
knowing
well
who
her
best
friend
was
at
bedtime
when
the
dear
old
lady
came
to
give
the
kiss
which
the
others
forgot
rosy
as
miss
penny
called
her
made
her
request
and
it
was
granted
for
miss
penny
had
a
feeling
that
the
little
peacemaker
would
sooner
or
later
heal
the
breach
with
her
pretty
magic
and
so
she
was
very
ready
to
lend
a
hand
in
a
quiet
way
next
day
at
button
was
hurrying
down
her
last
bit
of
gingerbread
which
she
was
obliged
to
eat
properly
in
the
instead
of
enjoying
when
she
heard
a
sudden
flurry
in
the
garden
and
running
to
the
window
saw
roxy
the
maid
chasing
a
chicken
to
and
fro
while
miss
henny
stood
flapping
her
skirts
on
the
steps
and
crying
shoo
till
she
was
red
in
the
face
it
the
white
banty
and
it
must
have
come
in
my
hole
oh
dear
i
hope
they
wo
catch
it
cousin
henny
said
she
wring
the
neck
of
the
first
one
that
flied
over
the
away
went
rosy
to
join
in
the
hunt
for
miss
henny
was
too
fat
to
run
and
roxy
found
the
lively
fowl
too
much
for
her
it
was
a
long
and
hard
chase
feathers
flew
the
maid
lost
her
breath
rosy
tumbled
down
and
miss
henny
screamed
and
scolded
till
she
was
forced
to
sit
down
and
watch
in
silence
at
last
poor
hunted
banty
ran
into
the
arbor
for
its
clipped
wings
would
not
lift
it
over
the
wall
button
rushed
after
it
and
dismal
squalls
plainly
proclaimed
that
the
naughty
chicken
was
caught
miss
henny
waddled
down
the
path
declaring
that
she
would
wring
its
neck
and
roxy
went
puffing
after
her
glad
to
rest
but
the
old
was
empty
no
little
girl
no
ruffled
bantam
appeared
both
had
vanished
like
magic
and
mistress
and
maid
stared
at
each
other
in
amazement
till
they
saw
that
the
window
was
open
and
a
gleam
of
light
came
in
from
the
narrow
opening
behind
my
patience
if
that
child
has
crept
out
there
and
bolted
through
that
hole
in
the
fence
did
you
ever
miss
exclaimed
roxy
trying
not
to
look
pleased
at
being
spared
the
distasteful
task
of
killing
the
poor
chicken
naughty
girl
began
miss
henny
when
the
sound
of
voices
made
both
listen
slip
in
there
and
see
what
is
going
on
said
the
mistress
well
knowing
that
her
stout
person
never
could
be
squeezed
into
the
small
space
between
house
and
fence
roxy
being
thin
easily
obeyed
and
in
a
whisper
telephoned
what
went
on
beyond
the
hole
causing
miss
henny
much
vexation
surprise
and
at
last
real
pleasure
as
the
child
performed
her
little
part
in
the
mission
she
had
undertaken
oh
please
it
all
my
fault
i
kept
the
hole
open
thomas
and
so
banty
flied
in
but
it
is
hurt
a
bit
and
i
brought
it
home
all
safe
i
know
you
love
your
chickies
and
tabby
ate
lots
of
said
the
childish
voice
in
its
most
conciliatory
tone
why
did
you
fling
it
over
the
wall
as
i
did
the
cat
asked
dover
smiling
as
he
shut
up
the
truant
fowl
and
turned
to
look
at
the
rosy
breathless
child
whose
pink
frock
bore
the
marks
of
many
a
tumble
on
grass
and
gravel
it
would
hurt
banty
feelings
and
yours
too
and
not
be
polite
so
i
came
myself
to
make
some
pollygies
and
say
it
was
my
fault
but
please
could
i
keep
the
hole
to
peep
through
if
i
always
put
up
a
board
when
i
go
away
it
is
so
dull
in
there
and
so
sweet
in
here
do
you
think
a
little
gate
would
be
nicer
one
just
big
enough
for
you
with
a
hook
to
fasten
it
we
call
it
a
laughed
dover
then
you
could
peep
or
perhaps
the
ladies
will
think
better
of
it
and
show
that
they
pardon
my
ill
treatment
of
tabby
by
letting
you
come
in
and
pick
some
cherries
and
roses
now
and
this
charming
proposal
caused
the
little
girl
to
clasp
her
hands
and
cry
aloud
that
would
be
perfully
i
know
cousin
penny
would
like
it
and
let
me
she
come
herself
she
so
thin
she
could
and
she
loves
your
mother
and
wants
to
see
her
only
cousin
henny
wo
let
us
be
nice
and
friendly
you
send
her
some
cherries
she
loves
good
things
to
eat
and
maybe
she
will
say
yes
if
you
send
dover
laughed
at
this
artless
proposal
and
miss
henny
smiled
at
the
prospect
of
a
gift
of
the
luscious
cherries
she
had
been
longing
for
roxy
wisely
repeated
only
the
agreeable
parts
of
the
conversation
so
nothing
ruffled
the
lady
temper
now
whether
dover
sharp
eye
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
among
the
gooseberry
bushes
and
suspected
eavesdroppers
or
whether
the
child
earnest
desire
to
make
peace
touched
him
who
shall
say
certain
it
is
that
his
eyes
twinkled
like
a
boy
as
he
said
rather
loudly
in
his
most
affable
tone
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
send
miss
henrietta
a
basket
of
fruit
she
used
to
be
a
charming
young
woman
it
a
pity
she
shuts
herself
up
so
much
but
that
sad
little
romance
of
hers
has
darkened
her
life
i
suppose
ah
well
i
can
sympathize
with
her
rosy
stared
at
the
sudden
change
in
his
manner
and
was
rather
bewildered
by
his
way
of
talking
to
her
but
being
intent
on
securing
something
nice
to
carry
home
she
stuck
to
the
cherries
which
she
did
understand
and
pointing
to
the
piazza
said
with
a
air
there
a
basket
so
we
might
pick
right
away
i
love
to
go
up
in
trees
and
throw
down
and
i
know
cousin
henny
will
like
cherries
ever
so
much
and
not
scold
a
bit
when
i
take
some
to
then
come
on
cried
thomas
relapsing
into
the
hearty
manner
she
liked
so
much
and
away
he
went
quite
briskly
down
the
path
with
his
yellow
skirts
waving
in
the
wind
and
button
skipping
after
him
in
great
glee
they
actually
are
cherries
miss
up
in
the
tree
like
a
couple
of
robins
and
laughin
as
gay
as
can
be
reported
roxy
from
her
rip
off
the
rest
of
that
board
then
i
can
see
whispered
miss
henny
quivering
with
interest
now
for
she
had
heard
words
and
her
wrath
was
appeased
by
that
flattering
allusion
to
herself
off
came
the
rest
of
the
board
and
from
the
window
half
hidden
in
woodbine
she
could
now
see
over
the
bushes
into
the
next
garden
the
commanded
the
tree
and
she
watched
with
eager
eyes
the
filling
of
the
basket
to
be
sent
her
planning
the
while
a
charming
note
of
thanks
do
look
miss
they
are
resting
now
and
she
on
his
knee
it
a
pretty
picter
whispered
roxy
unmindful
of
the
earwigs
ants
and
promenading
over
her
as
she
crouched
in
her
mouldy
corner
intent
on
the
view
beyond
very
pretty
he
lost
several
children
in
india
and
i
suppose
rosy
reminds
him
of
them
ah
poor
man
i
can
sympathize
with
him
for
too
have
loved
and
lost
sighed
miss
henny
pensively
surveying
the
group
on
the
rustic
seat
they
were
playing
and
the
child
laughter
made
pleasant
music
in
the
usually
quiet
place
while
the
man
face
lost
its
sad
stern
look
and
was
both
gay
and
tender
as
he
held
the
little
creature
close
and
popped
the
ripe
fruit
into
the
red
laughing
mouth
as
the
last
sweet
morsel
disappeared
rosy
said
with
a
long
breath
of
perfect
content
it
almost
as
good
as
having
papa
to
play
with
i
do
hope
the
cousins
will
let
me
come
again
if
they
do
i
think
my
heart
will
break
i
get
so
homesick
over
there
and
have
so
many
trials
and
no
one
but
cousin
penny
ever
cuddles
bless
her
heart
we
send
her
some
flowers
for
that
you
tell
her
that
dover
is
poorly
and
would
like
very
much
to
see
her
and
so
would
thomas
who
enjoys
her
little
niece
immensely
can
you
remember
that
every
word
she
is
very
nice
to
me
and
i
love
her
and
i
guess
she
will
be
glad
to
come
she
likes
and
so
do
i
added
the
unblushing
little
beggar
as
dover
took
out
his
knife
and
began
to
make
the
bouquet
which
was
to
be
miss
penny
bribe
he
could
not
bear
to
give
up
his
little
playmate
and
was
quite
ready
to
try
again
with
this
persistent
and
charming
ally
to
help
him
heal
the
breach
shall
you
send
anything
to
cis
you
need
mind
about
it
she
ca
keep
me
at
home
but
it
might
please
her
and
make
her
stop
rapping
my
head
with
her
thimble
when
i
ask
questions
and
slapping
my
fingers
when
i
touch
any
of
her
pretty
things
suggested
button
as
the
flowers
were
added
to
the
fruit
making
a
fine
display
i
never
send
presents
to
young
ladies
said
thomas
shortly
adding
with
both
hands
out
and
his
most
inviting
smile
but
i
always
kiss
nice
little
girls
if
they
will
allow
me
button
threw
both
arms
about
his
neck
and
gave
him
a
shower
of
grateful
kisses
which
were
sweeter
to
the
lonely
old
man
than
all
the
cherries
that
ever
grew
or
the
finest
flowers
in
his
garden
then
miss
rosamond
proudly
marched
home
finding
no
trace
of
the
watchers
for
both
had
fled
while
the
cuddling
went
on
roxy
was
soberly
setting
the
and
miss
henny
in
the
parlor
breathing
hard
behind
a
newspaper
miss
penny
and
cicely
were
spending
the
day
out
so
the
roses
had
to
wait
but
the
basket
was
most
graciously
received
also
the
carefully
delivered
message
and
the
child
heart
was
rejoiced
by
free
permission
to
go
and
see
our
kind
neighbor
now
and
then
if
sister
does
not
rosy
was
in
great
spirits
and
prattled
away
as
they
sat
at
dinner
emboldened
by
the
lady
unusual
amiability
to
ask
all
sorts
of
questions
some
of
which
proved
rather
embarrassing
to
miss
henny
and
very
amusing
to
roxy
listening
in
the
i
wish
had
was
the
abrupt
remark
of
the
small
person
as
her
plate
of
was
removed
and
the
pudding
appeared
accompanied
by
the
cherries
why
dear
asked
miss
henny
busily
arranging
the
small
dish
of
delicate
tidbits
which
left
little
but
the
skeleton
of
the
roast
fowl
for
the
kitchen
then
i
could
have
the
nicest
bits
of
chicken
and
heaps
of
sauce
on
my
pudding
and
the
butteryest
slices
of
toast
and
all
the
cream
for
my
tea
as
you
do
it
is
a
very
bad
pain
is
it
asked
rosy
in
such
perfect
good
faith
that
miss
henny
sudden
flush
and
hasty
dive
into
the
closet
never
suggested
to
her
that
this
innocent
speech
was
bringing
the
old
lady
besetting
sin
to
light
in
the
most
open
manner
yes
child
it
is
very
bad
and
you
may
thank
your
stars
that
i
try
to
keep
you
from
it
by
feeding
you
on
plain
food
at
my
age
and
suffering
as
i
do
the
best
of
everything
is
needed
to
keep
up
my
strength
said
miss
henny
tartly
but
the
largest
plate
of
pudding
with
heaps
of
sauce
went
to
the
child
this
day
and
when
the
fruit
was
served
an
unusually
small
portion
was
put
away
for
the
invalid
who
was
obliged
to
sustain
nature
with
frequent
lunches
through
the
day
and
evening
i
that
you
suffer
much
cousin
henny
how
brave
you
must
be
not
to
cry
about
it
and
go
round
in
horrid
pain
as
you
do
and
dress
so
nicely
and
see
people
and
work
and
make
calls
i
hope
i
shall
be
brave
if
i
ever
do
have
but
i
guess
i
sha
you
take
such
care
to
give
me
small
pieces
every
with
which
cheerful
remark
rosy
closed
that
part
of
the
conversation
and
returned
to
the
delights
of
her
new
friend
garden
but
from
that
day
among
other
changes
which
began
about
this
time
the
child
cup
and
plate
were
well
filled
and
the
dread
of
adding
to
her
own
sufferings
seemed
to
curb
the
dyspeptic
voracious
appetite
a
cheild
was
amang
them
takin
notes
and
every
one
involuntarily
dreaded
those
clear
eyes
and
that
frank
tongue
so
innocently
observing
and
criticising
all
that
went
on
cicely
had
already
been
reminded
of
a
neglected
duty
by
rosy
reading
to
miss
penny
and
tried
to
be
more
faithful
in
that
as
in
other
services
which
she
owed
the
old
lady
so
the
little
missionary
was
evidently
getting
on
though
quite
unconscious
of
her
work
at
home
so
absorbed
was
she
in
her
foreign
mission
for
like
many
another
missionary
the
savage
over
the
way
was
more
interesting
than
the
selfish
slothful
or
neglected
souls
at
home
miss
penny
was
charmed
with
her
flowers
and
the
friendly
message
sent
her
and
to
rosy
great
delight
went
next
day
in
best
bonnet
and
gown
to
make
a
call
upon
the
old
lady
who
was
poorly
for
that
appeal
could
not
be
resisted
rosy
also
in
honor
of
the
great
occasion
wore
her
best
hat
and
a
white
frock
so
stiff
that
she
looked
like
a
little
opera
dancer
as
the
long
black
legs
skipped
along
the
street
for
it
was
far
too
grand
a
visit
to
be
paid
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
in
the
basket
were
certain
delicacies
for
the
old
lady
and
a
card
had
been
prepared
with
the
names
of
miss
carey
and
miss
rosamond
carey
beautifully
written
on
it
by
cis
who
was
dying
to
go
but
dared
not
after
rosy
had
told
her
dover
remark
about
young
ladies
as
the
procession
of
two
paused
at
the
door
both
the
young
and
the
old
heart
fluttered
a
little
for
this
was
the
first
decided
step
toward
reconciliation
and
any
check
might
spoil
it
all
the
maid
stared
but
civilly
led
these
unexpected
guests
in
and
departed
with
the
card
miss
penny
settled
herself
in
a
large
chair
and
looked
about
with
pensive
interest
at
the
familiar
room
but
rosy
made
a
for
the
great
and
regardless
of
her
clean
frock
lay
down
on
it
to
examine
the
head
which
glared
at
her
with
yellow
eyes
showing
all
its
sharp
teeth
in
the
most
delightfully
natural
manner
dover
came
in
with
a
formal
bow
but
miss
penny
put
out
both
hands
and
said
in
her
sweet
old
voice
let
us
be
friends
again
for
the
sake
of
your
that
settled
the
matter
at
once
and
thomas
was
so
eager
to
do
his
part
that
he
not
only
shook
the
hands
heartily
but
kept
them
in
his
as
he
said
like
an
honest
man
my
dear
neighbor
i
beg
your
pardon
was
wrong
but
i
not
too
proud
to
own
it
and
say
i
glad
to
let
be
for
the
sake
of
all
now
come
and
see
my
mother
she
is
longing
for
what
went
on
in
the
next
room
rosy
never
knew
or
cared
for
thomas
soon
returned
and
amused
her
so
well
showing
his
treasures
that
she
forgot
where
she
was
till
the
maid
came
to
say
tea
was
ready
are
we
going
to
stay
cried
the
little
girl
beaming
from
under
a
feejee
crown
of
feathers
which
produced
as
comical
an
effect
upon
her
curly
head
as
did
the
collar
of
shark
teeth
round
her
plump
neck
or
the
great
japanese
in
her
hand
yes
we
have
tea
at
five
come
and
turn
it
out
i
ordered
the
little
cups
especially
for
you
said
her
host
as
he
changed
the
small
amazon
to
a
pretty
child
again
and
led
her
away
to
preside
at
the
table
where
the
quaint
china
and
silver
and
the
dainty
cake
and
bread
and
butter
proved
much
more
attractive
than
the
little
old
lady
in
a
big
cap
who
patted
her
head
and
smiled
at
her
never
had
rosy
enjoyed
such
a
delicious
meal
for
the
rapture
of
pouring
real
tea
out
of
a
pot
shaped
like
a
silver
melon
into
cups
as
thin
as
and
putting
in
sugar
with
tongs
like
claws
not
to
mention
much
thick
cream
also
spicy
plummy
cakes
that
melted
in
one
mouth
was
too
great
for
words
the
little
maid
was
so
absorbed
in
her
new
duties
that
she
never
minded
what
the
elders
talked
about
till
the
plates
were
empty
the
pot
ran
dry
and
no
one
could
be
prevailed
on
to
have
any
more
tea
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
remarked
with
an
air
of
calm
satisfaction
as
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
smiled
that
engaging
smile
of
hers
is
being
friends
a
great
deal
nicer
than
fighting
and
throwing
cats
over
walls
and
calling
bad
names
it
was
impossible
not
to
laugh
and
that
cheerful
sound
seemed
to
tune
every
one
to
the
sweetest
harmony
while
the
little
peacemaker
was
passed
round
as
if
a
last
course
of
kisses
was
absolutely
necessary
then
the
party
broke
up
and
dover
escorted
his
guests
to
their
own
gate
to
the
great
amazement
of
the
neighbors
and
the
very
visible
pride
of
miss
who
went
up
the
walk
with
her
head
as
high
as
if
the
wreath
of
daisies
on
her
little
hat
had
been
a
conqueror
crown
now
that
the
first
step
had
been
taken
all
would
have
gone
smoothly
if
cicely
offended
because
thomas
took
no
notice
of
her
had
not
put
it
into
miss
henny
head
that
as
the
original
quarrel
began
between
her
and
their
neighbor
it
would
not
be
dignified
to
give
in
till
dover
had
come
and
begged
pardon
of
her
as
well
as
of
miss
penny
this
suited
the
foolish
old
lady
who
never
could
forget
certain
plain
words
spoken
in
the
heat
of
battle
though
the
kindly
ones
lately
heard
had
much
softened
her
heart
toward
the
offender
no
i
shall
not
forget
my
dignity
nor
humble
myself
by
going
over
there
to
apologize
as
penelope
has
she
can
do
as
she
likes
and
now
that
he
has
asked
to
be
forgiven
there
is
perhaps
no
harm
in
her
seeing
the
old
lady
but
with
me
it
is
different
was
insulted
and
till
thomas
dover
comes
here
and
solemnly
asks
my
pardon
i
will
not
cross
his
threshold
no
matter
what
bribes
he
sends
said
miss
henny
with
an
air
of
heroic
firmness
but
it
did
cost
her
a
pang
when
her
sister
went
every
now
and
then
to
take
tea
with
the
old
lady
and
came
home
full
of
pleasant
news
while
rosy
prattled
of
the
fine
things
she
saw
the
nice
things
she
had
to
eat
and
never
failed
to
bring
some
gift
to
share
or
to
display
to
the
exiles
from
paradise
they
ate
the
bribes
however
as
they
called
the
fruit
admired
the
pretty
trinkets
and
toys
and
longed
to
share
in
the
mild
festivities
of
the
pleasant
house
over
the
way
but
stood
firm
in
spite
of
all
rosy
wiles
till
something
unexpected
happened
to
touch
their
hearts
conquer
their
foolish
pride
and
crown
the
little
peacemaker
efforts
with
success
one
august
afternoon
cicely
was
discontentedly
looking
over
her
small
store
of
ornaments
as
she
made
ready
for
a
party
she
loved
gayety
and
went
about
a
great
deal
leaving
many
duties
undone
or
asking
the
little
girl
to
attend
to
them
for
her
neglecting
however
to
show
any
gratitude
for
these
small
services
so
cheerfully
done
as
she
sat
tossing
over
her
boxes
came
in
looking
tired
and
listless
for
it
was
a
hot
day
and
she
had
been
out
twice
to
do
errands
for
cicely
besides
trotting
busily
up
and
down
to
wait
on
the
old
ladies
while
the
young
one
put
fresh
ribbons
on
her
dress
and
curled
her
hair
for
the
evening
could
i
lie
on
your
sofa
please
cis
my
head
aches
and
my
legs
are
so
tired
said
little
button
when
her
tap
had
been
answered
by
a
sharp
what
do
you
want
child
no
i
going
to
lie
there
myself
and
have
a
nap
as
soon
as
done
here
it
cooler
than
the
bed
and
i
must
be
fresh
for
said
cicely
too
intent
on
her
own
affairs
to
see
how
used
up
rosy
looked
then
could
i
look
at
your
pretty
things
if
i
do
touch
asked
the
child
longing
to
peep
into
the
interesting
boxes
scattered
on
the
table
no
you
ca
i
busy
and
do
want
you
asking
questions
and
meddling
go
away
and
let
me
cicely
spoke
crossly
and
waved
her
hand
with
a
warning
gesture
thereby
upsetting
the
tray
which
held
the
beads
of
the
necklace
she
had
decided
to
wear
for
want
of
something
better
there
now
see
what
you
done
pick
up
every
one
and
be
quick
for
i
in
a
but
i
did
touch
began
poor
button
as
she
crept
about
hunting
for
the
black
and
white
beads
that
looked
like
very
ugly
marbles
do
talk
pick
them
up
and
then
scamper
you
are
always
in
mischief
scolded
cis
vexed
with
herself
and
the
heat
and
the
accident
and
the
whole
world
just
then
rosy
said
no
more
but
several
great
tears
dropped
on
the
carpet
as
she
groped
in
corners
under
the
bed
and
behind
the
chairs
for
the
and
when
the
last
was
found
she
put
it
in
her
hand
saying
with
a
wistful
look
i
very
sorry
i
troubled
you
seems
to
me
if
had
a
little
cousin
i
love
to
have
her
play
with
my
things
and
i
would
be
cross
to
her
now
i
go
and
try
to
amoose
myself
with
bella
she
is
always
good
to
run
along
then
thank
goodness
that
doll
came
when
it
did
for
tired
of
small
girls
as
well
as
old
ladies
said
cis
busy
with
her
beads
yet
sorry
she
had
been
so
petulant
with
patient
little
button
who
seldom
reproached
her
being
a
cheery
child
and
blessed
with
a
sweet
temper
rosy
felt
too
languid
to
play
so
when
she
had
told
bella
the
london
doll
her
trials
and
comforted
herself
with
some
kisses
on
the
waxen
cheeks
she
roamed
away
to
the
which
was
cool
and
quiet
longing
for
some
one
to
caress
her
for
the
little
heart
was
homesick
and
the
little
head
ached
badly
the
had
been
made
the
alley
swept
out
to
the
great
dismay
of
the
spiders
earwigs
and
toads
who
had
fled
to
quieter
quarters
and
rosy
had
leave
to
go
and
come
when
she
liked
if
dover
did
not
object
he
never
did
and
it
was
her
greatest
delight
to
walk
in
the
pretty
garden
at
her
own
sweet
will
always
with
the
hope
of
meeting
its
kindly
owner
for
now
they
were
firm
friends
she
had
been
too
busy
for
a
run
there
that
day
and
now
as
she
peeped
in
it
looked
so
shady
and
inviting
and
it
seemed
so
natural
to
turn
to
her
dear
missionary
man
for
entertainment
that
she
went
straight
up
to
his
study
window
and
peeped
in
he
too
seemed
out
of
sorts
that
hot
afternoon
for
he
sat
leaning
his
head
on
both
hands
at
the
desk
strewn
with
piles
of
old
letters
tender
heart
yearned
over
him
at
once
and
stepping
quietly
in
at
the
long
open
window
she
went
to
him
saying
in
her
tenderest
tone
does
your
head
ache
sir
let
me
soft
it
as
i
do
papa
he
says
that
always
makes
it
more
better
please
let
me
i
love
to
ah
my
darling
i
wish
you
could
but
the
pain
is
in
my
heart
and
nothing
will
ever
cure
it
sighed
thomas
as
he
drew
her
close
and
put
his
wrinkled
yellow
cheek
to
her
soft
one
which
looked
more
like
a
damask
rose
than
usual
you
have
trials
too
i
mine
trouble
me
so
i
came
over
to
see
you
shall
i
go
away
asked
rosy
with
a
sigh
and
the
wistful
look
again
no
stay
and
we
will
comfort
each
other
tell
me
your
troubles
button
and
perhaps
i
can
help
them
the
kind
old
gentleman
said
as
he
took
her
on
his
knee
and
stroked
the
curly
head
with
a
paternal
touch
so
rosy
told
her
latest
grief
and
never
saw
the
smile
that
crept
about
the
lips
that
asked
in
a
tone
of
deep
interest
well
what
do
you
mean
to
do
to
that
unkind
cicely
for
a
minute
i
wanted
to
slap
her
back
when
she
tried
to
spat
my
hands
then
i
that
mamma
said
a
kiss
for
a
blow
was
a
good
thing
so
i
picked
up
the
beads
and
planned
to
do
it
but
cis
looked
so
cross
i
could
if
i
had
a
pretty
necklace
i
go
and
give
it
to
her
and
then
maybe
she
love
me
my
dear
little
missionary
you
shall
have
beads
to
win
the
heart
of
your
heathen
if
that
is
all
you
need
see
here
take
anything
you
like
and
give
it
with
the
as
he
spoke
dover
pulled
open
a
drawer
in
the
desk
and
displayed
a
delightful
collection
of
pretty
quaint
and
curious
trinkets
picked
up
in
foreign
lands
and
kept
for
keepsakes
since
no
little
daughters
of
his
own
lived
to
wear
them
how
dorgeous
cried
rosy
who
often
fell
into
baby
talk
when
excited
and
plunging
in
her
hands
she
revelled
for
some
minutes
in
cases
carved
ivory
fans
silver
bangles
barbaric
brooches
and
necklaces
of
coral
shells
amber
and
golden
coins
that
jingled
musically
what
shall
i
take
for
her
cried
the
little
maid
bewildered
by
such
a
mine
of
wealth
you
pick
out
one
thomas
that
will
please
her
so
much
you
never
send
her
anything
and
she
do
like
it
said
rosy
fearing
that
her
own
taste
was
not
to
be
trusted
as
she
liked
the
shells
and
shark
teeth
ornaments
best
no
i
give
you
one
and
you
shall
do
as
you
like
about
giving
it
to
her
this
now
is
really
valuable
and
pretty
and
any
young
lady
would
like
to
wear
it
it
makes
me
think
of
you
my
button
for
it
is
like
sunshine
and
the
word
cut
on
the
little
heart
means
dover
held
up
a
string
of
amber
beads
with
its
carved
amulet
and
swung
it
to
and
fro
where
the
light
shone
through
it
till
each
bead
looked
like
a
drop
of
golden
wine
yes
that
is
lovely
and
it
smells
nice
too
she
will
be
so
and
pleased
i
go
and
take
it
to
her
right
away
cried
rosy
forgetting
to
ask
anything
for
herself
in
her
delight
at
this
fine
gift
for
cis
but
as
she
lifted
her
head
after
he
had
fastened
the
clasp
about
her
neck
something
in
his
face
recalled
the
look
it
wore
when
she
first
came
in
and
putting
both
hands
upon
his
shoulders
she
said
in
her
sweet
little
way
you
made
my
troubles
go
away
ca
i
make
yours
you
are
so
kind
to
me
i
love
to
help
you
if
i
you
do
my
child
more
than
you
know
for
when
i
get
you
in
my
arms
it
seems
as
if
one
of
my
poor
babies
had
come
back
to
me
and
for
a
minute
i
forget
the
three
little
graves
far
away
in
three
cried
button
like
a
sad
soft
echo
and
she
clung
to
the
poor
man
as
if
trying
to
fill
the
empty
arms
with
the
love
and
pity
that
the
childish
soul
in
her
small
body
this
was
the
comfort
thomas
wanted
and
for
a
few
moments
he
just
cradled
her
on
his
hungry
heart
crooning
a
hindostanee
lullaby
while
a
few
slow
tears
came
dropping
down
upon
the
yellow
head
so
like
those
hidden
for
years
under
the
indian
flowers
presently
he
seemed
to
come
back
from
the
happy
past
to
which
the
old
letters
had
carried
him
he
wiped
his
eyes
and
rosy
also
with
the
big
purple
silk
handkerchief
and
pressing
some
very
grateful
kisses
on
the
hot
cheeks
said
cheerfully
again
god
bless
you
child
that
done
me
good
but
do
let
it
sadden
you
dear
forget
all
about
it
and
tell
no
one
what
a
sentimental
old
fool
i
i
never
truly
will
only
when
you
feel
sorry
about
the
poor
little
babies
let
me
come
and
give
you
cuddlings
they
always
make
people
feel
more
better
and
i
love
and
do
get
any
now
my
dear
people
are
so
the
two
made
a
tender
little
plan
to
comfort
each
other
when
hearts
were
heavy
with
longings
for
the
absent
and
parted
at
the
small
gate
both
much
cheered
and
faster
friends
than
ever
rosy
hastened
in
with
her
forgetful
now
of
headache
or
loneliness
as
she
sat
patiently
in
the
wide
entry
listening
till
some
sound
in
cicely
room
should
show
that
she
was
awake
before
that
happened
however
poor
button
fell
asleep
herself
lulled
by
the
quiet
of
the
house
for
every
one
was
napping
and
dreamed
that
dover
stood
waving
a
rainbow
over
his
head
while
several
indian
gods
and
three
little
girls
were
dancing
round
him
hand
in
hand
to
the
tune
of
ring
around
a
a
loud
yawn
roused
her
and
there
was
cis
peeping
out
of
her
door
to
see
what
time
it
was
by
the
clock
on
the
landing
up
scrambled
the
child
feeling
dizzy
and
but
so
eager
to
give
pleasure
that
she
lost
no
time
in
saying
as
she
swung
the
necklace
in
the
sunshine
see
this
is
for
you
if
you
like
it
more
better
than
the
marbles
as
cousin
penny
calls
the
one
you
were
going
to
how
lovely
where
did
you
get
it
child
cried
cis
wide
awake
at
once
as
she
ran
to
the
glass
to
try
the
effect
of
the
new
ornament
on
her
white
neck
my
dear
thomas
gave
it
to
me
but
he
said
i
could
give
it
away
if
i
liked
and
i
want
you
to
have
it
it
ever
so
much
prettier
than
any
you
that
very
kind
of
you
chicken
but
why
not
keep
it
yourself
you
like
nice
things
as
well
as
i
do
said
cicely
much
impressed
by
the
value
of
the
gift
for
it
was
real
amber
and
the
clasp
of
gold
well
i
talked
with
thomas
about
missionarying
a
great
deal
and
he
told
me
how
he
made
the
savinges
good
by
giving
them
beads
and
things
to
eat
and
being
patient
and
kind
to
them
so
i
thought
i
play
be
a
missionary
and
call
this
house
africa
and
try
to
make
the
people
here
behave
more
better
answered
rosy
with
such
engaging
earnestness
as
well
as
frankness
that
cis
laughed
and
exclaimed
you
impertinent
monkey
to
call
us
heathen
and
try
to
convert
us
how
do
you
expect
to
do
it
oh
i
getting
on
pretty
well
only
you
do
convert
as
quick
as
some
of
the
savinges
did
i
tell
you
about
it
and
button
went
on
eagerly
cousin
penny
is
the
good
old
one
but
rather
fussy
and
slow
so
i
kind
and
patient
and
now
she
loves
me
and
lets
me
do
things
i
like
she
is
my
best
one
cousin
henny
is
my
cannybel
she
eats
so
much
and
i
please
her
by
bringing
nice
things
and
getting
her
cushions
ready
you
are
my
baddest
one
who
is
cross
to
me
and
fights
and
raps
my
head
and
slaps
my
hands
so
i
thought
some
beads
would
be
nice
for
you
and
i
bringed
these
beauties
thomas
gave
to
me
when
i
told
him
my
cicely
looked
angry
amused
and
ashamed
as
she
listened
to
the
funny
yet
rather
pathetic
little
play
with
which
the
lonely
child
had
tried
to
cheer
herself
and
win
the
hearts
of
those
about
her
she
had
the
grace
to
blush
and
offer
back
the
necklace
saying
in
a
tone
keep
your
beads
little
missionary
i
be
converted
without
them
and
try
to
be
kinder
to
you
i
am
a
selfish
wretch
but
you
shall
play
be
my
little
sister
and
not
have
to
go
to
strangers
for
comfort
in
your
trials
any
more
come
kiss
me
dear
and
begin
rosy
was
in
her
arms
at
once
and
clung
there
saying
with
a
face
all
smiles
that
what
i
wanted
i
thought
i
make
a
good
savinge
of
you
if
i
tried
very
hard
please
be
kind
to
me
just
till
mamma
comes
back
and
i
be
the
best
little
sister
that
ever
why
did
you
tell
me
all
about
it
before
asked
cicely
smoothing
the
tired
head
on
her
shoulder
with
a
new
gentleness
for
this
last
innocent
confession
had
touched
her
heart
as
well
as
her
conscience
you
never
seemed
to
care
about
my
plays
and
always
said
chatter
child
run
away
and
take
care
of
yourself
so
i
did
but
it
was
pretty
dull
with
only
tabby
to
tell
secrets
to
and
bella
to
kiss
thomas
said
people
over
here
did
like
children
very
well
and
i
found
they
did
he
does
dearly
so
i
went
to
him
but
i
like
you
now
you
are
so
soft
and
kind
to
how
hot
your
cheeks
are
come
and
let
me
cool
them
and
brush
your
hair
for
tea
said
cis
as
she
touched
the
child
feverish
skin
and
saw
how
heavy
her
eyes
were
i
all
burning
up
and
my
head
is
so
funny
i
do
want
any
tea
i
want
to
lie
on
your
sofa
and
go
to
sleep
again
can
i
asked
rosy
with
a
dizzy
look
about
the
room
and
a
shiver
at
the
idea
of
eating
yes
dear
i
put
on
your
little
wrapper
and
make
you
all
comfortable
and
bring
you
some
for
your
lips
are
very
as
she
spoke
cicely
bustled
about
the
room
and
soon
had
rosy
nicely
settled
with
her
best
and
a
fan
then
she
hastened
down
to
report
that
something
was
wrong
with
a
fear
in
her
own
heart
that
if
any
harm
did
come
to
the
child
it
would
be
her
fault
some
days
before
cicely
had
sent
with
a
note
to
a
friend
house
where
she
knew
some
of
the
younger
children
were
ill
since
then
she
had
heard
that
it
was
scarlet
fever
but
though
rosy
had
waited
some
time
for
an
answer
to
the
note
and
seen
one
of
the
invalids
cis
had
never
mentioned
the
fact
being
ashamed
to
confess
her
carelessness
hoping
no
harm
was
done
now
she
felt
that
it
had
come
and
went
to
tell
gentle
cousin
penny
with
tears
of
vain
regret
great
was
the
lamentation
when
the
doctor
who
was
sent
for
in
hot
haste
pronounced
it
scarlet
fever
and
deep
was
the
of
the
two
older
women
for
their
blindness
in
not
before
remarking
the
languid
air
and
want
of
appetite
in
the
child
but
cicely
was
full
of
remorse
for
every
quick
word
every
rap
of
the
hateful
thimble
every
service
accepted
without
thanks
weighed
heavily
on
her
conscience
now
as
such
things
have
an
inconvenient
way
of
doing
when
it
is
too
late
to
undo
them
every
one
was
devoted
to
the
child
even
lazy
miss
henny
gave
up
her
naps
to
sit
by
her
at
all
hours
miss
penny
hovered
over
the
little
bed
like
a
grandmother
and
cicely
refused
to
think
of
pleasure
till
the
danger
was
over
for
soon
was
very
ill
and
the
old
house
haunted
by
the
dreadful
fear
that
death
would
rob
them
of
the
little
creature
who
grew
so
precious
when
the
thought
of
losing
her
made
their
hearts
stand
still
how
could
they
live
without
the
sound
of
that
sweet
voice
chirping
about
the
house
the
busy
feet
tripping
up
and
down
the
willing
hands
trying
to
help
the
sunny
face
smiling
at
every
one
and
going
away
into
corners
to
hide
the
tears
that
sometimes
came
to
dim
its
brightness
what
would
comfort
the
absent
mother
for
such
a
loss
as
this
and
how
could
they
answer
to
the
father
for
the
carelessness
that
risked
the
child
life
for
a
girl
errand
no
one
dared
to
think
and
all
prayed
heartily
for
rosy
life
as
they
watched
and
waited
by
the
little
bed
where
she
lay
so
patiently
till
the
fever
grew
high
and
she
began
to
babble
about
many
things
her
childish
trials
were
all
told
her
longings
for
mamma
whose
place
no
one
could
fill
her
quaint
little
criticisms
upon
those
about
her
and
her
plans
for
making
peace
these
innocent
revelations
caused
many
tears
and
wrought
some
changes
in
those
who
heard
for
miss
penny
quite
forgot
her
infirmities
to
live
in
the
as
the
most
experienced
nurse
and
tenderest
watcher
miss
henny
cooked
her
daintiest
gruel
brewed
her
coolest
drinks
and
lost
many
pounds
in
weight
by
her
indefatigable
trotting
up
and
down
to
minister
to
the
invalid
least
caprice
cicely
was
kept
away
for
fear
of
infection
but
her
penance
was
to
wander
about
the
great
house
more
silent
than
ever
now
to
answer
the
inquiries
and
listen
to
the
sad
forebodings
of
the
neighbors
who
came
to
offer
help
and
sympathy
for
all
loved
little
and
grieved
to
think
of
any
blight
falling
on
the
pretty
blossom
to
wile
away
the
long
hours
cicely
fell
to
dusting
the
empty
rooms
setting
closets
and
drawers
to
rights
and
keeping
all
fresh
and
clean
to
the
great
relief
of
the
old
cousins
who
felt
that
everything
would
go
to
destruction
in
their
absence
she
read
and
sewed
now
having
no
heart
for
jaunting
about
and
as
she
made
the
long
neglected
white
pinafores
for
rosy
she
thought
much
of
the
little
girl
who
might
never
live
to
wear
them
meantime
the
fever
took
its
course
and
came
at
last
to
the
fateful
day
when
a
few
hours
would
settle
the
question
of
life
or
death
the
hot
flush
died
out
of
the
cheeks
that
had
lost
their
soft
roundness
now
the
lips
were
parched
the
eyes
looked
like
sick
violets
and
all
the
pretty
curls
were
tangled
on
the
pillow
rosy
no
longer
sung
to
bella
talked
of
three
dear
little
girls
and
thomas
tigers
and
bangles
cis
and
necklaces
hens
and
gates
she
ceased
to
call
for
mamma
asked
no
more
why
her
missionary
man
never
came
and
took
no
notice
of
the
anxious
old
faces
bending
over
her
she
lay
in
a
stupor
and
the
doctor
held
the
little
wasted
hand
and
tried
to
see
the
face
of
his
watch
with
dim
eyes
as
he
counted
the
faint
pulse
whispering
solemnly
we
can
only
hope
and
wait
now
sleep
alone
can
save
as
the
sisters
sat
one
on
either
side
the
narrow
bed
that
day
and
cicely
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
the
long
hall
below
where
both
doors
stood
open
to
let
in
the
cool
evening
air
as
the
sun
went
down
a
quick
but
quiet
step
came
up
the
steps
and
dover
walked
in
without
ringing
he
had
been
away
and
coming
home
an
hour
ago
heard
the
sad
news
losing
not
a
moment
he
hurried
to
ask
about
his
little
button
and
his
face
showed
how
great
his
love
and
fear
were
as
he
said
in
a
broken
whisper
will
she
live
my
mother
never
told
me
how
serious
it
was
or
i
should
have
returned
at
we
hope
so
sir
but
and
there
cicely
voice
failed
as
she
hid
her
face
and
sobbed
my
dear
girl
do
give
way
keep
up
your
heart
hope
pray
will
that
the
darling
shall
live
and
that
may
do
some
good
we
ca
let
her
go
we
wo
let
her
go
let
me
see
her
i
know
much
of
fevers
far
worse
than
this
and
might
be
able
to
suggest
something
begged
dover
throwing
down
his
hat
and
waving
an
immense
fan
with
such
an
air
of
resolution
and
cheery
that
tired
cis
felt
comforted
at
once
and
led
the
way
upstairs
entirely
forgetting
the
great
feud
as
he
did
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
he
paused
till
the
girl
had
whispered
his
name
miss
penny
always
a
gentlewoman
rose
at
once
and
went
to
meet
him
but
miss
henny
did
not
even
seem
to
see
him
for
just
then
as
if
dimly
feeling
that
her
friend
was
near
rosy
stirred
and
gave
a
long
sigh
silently
the
three
stood
and
looked
at
the
beloved
little
creature
lying
there
in
the
mysterious
shadow
of
death
and
they
so
helpless
to
keep
her
if
the
hour
for
departure
had
come
god
help
us
sighed
pious
miss
penny
folding
her
old
hands
as
if
they
did
that
often
now
drifting
away
i
fear
and
miss
henny
plump
face
looked
almost
beautiful
with
the
tears
on
it
as
she
leaned
nearer
to
listen
to
the
faint
breath
at
the
child
lips
no
we
will
keep
her
please
the
lord
if
we
can
make
her
sleep
quietly
for
the
next
few
hours
she
is
safe
let
me
try
fan
slowly
with
this
miss
henrietta
and
you
dear
lady
pray
that
the
precious
little
life
may
be
given
as
he
spoke
dover
gave
the
great
fan
to
miss
henny
took
the
small
cold
hands
in
his
and
sitting
on
the
bedside
held
them
close
in
his
large
warm
ones
as
if
trying
to
pour
life
and
strength
into
the
frail
body
as
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ones
seemed
to
call
back
the
innocent
soul
hovering
on
the
threshold
of
its
prison
like
the
butterfly
poised
upon
the
chrysalis
before
it
soars
away
miss
penny
knelt
down
near
by
and
laying
her
white
head
on
the
other
pillow
again
besought
god
to
spare
this
treasure
to
the
father
and
mother
over
the
sea
how
long
they
remained
so
none
of
them
ever
knew
silent
and
motionless
but
for
the
slow
waving
of
the
noiseless
fan
which
went
to
and
fro
like
the
wing
of
a
great
white
bird
as
if
miss
henny
stout
arm
could
never
tire
miss
penny
was
so
still
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
dover
never
stirred
but
grew
paler
as
the
minutes
passed
and
cicely
creeping
now
and
then
to
look
in
and
steal
away
saw
strange
power
in
the
black
eyes
that
seemed
to
hold
the
fluttering
spirit
of
the
little
child
by
the
love
and
longing
that
made
them
both
tender
and
commanding
a
level
ray
of
sunlight
stole
through
the
curtain
at
last
and
turned
the
tangles
of
bright
hair
to
pure
gold
miss
henny
rose
to
shut
it
out
and
as
if
her
movement
broke
the
spell
rosy
took
a
long
full
breath
turned
on
the
pillow
and
putting
one
hand
under
her
cheek
seemed
to
fall
asleep
as
naturally
as
she
used
to
do
when
well
miss
penny
looked
up
touched
the
child
forehead
and
whispered
with
a
look
of
gratitude
as
bright
as
if
the
sunshine
had
touched
her
also
it
is
moist
this
is
real
sleep
oh
my
baby
oh
my
baby
and
the
old
head
went
down
again
with
a
stifled
sob
for
her
experienced
eye
told
her
that
the
danger
was
passing
by
and
rosy
would
live
the
prayers
of
the
righteous
avail
much
murmured
dover
turning
to
the
other
lady
who
stood
beside
her
sister
looking
down
at
the
little
figure
now
lying
so
restfully
between
them
how
can
we
thank
you
she
whispered
offering
her
hand
with
the
smile
which
had
once
made
her
pretty
and
still
touched
the
old
face
with
something
better
than
beauty
dover
took
the
hand
and
answered
with
an
eloquent
look
at
the
child
let
not
the
sun
go
down
upon
our
wrath
forgive
me
and
be
friends
again
for
her
i
will
and
the
plump
hands
gave
the
thin
ones
a
hearty
shake
as
the
great
feud
ended
forever
over
the
bed
of
the
little
peacemaker
whose
childish
play
had
turned
to
happy
earnest
and
here
your
breakfast
miss
i
hope
it
right
your
mother
showed
me
how
to
fix
it
and
said
i
find
a
cup
up
take
that
blue
one
i
have
not
much
appetite
and
ca
eat
if
things
are
not
nice
and
pretty
i
like
the
flowers
i
been
longing
for
some
ever
since
i
saw
them
last
the
first
speaker
was
a
girl
in
a
brown
calico
dress
and
white
apron
with
a
tray
in
her
hands
and
an
air
of
timid
hospitality
in
her
manner
the
second
a
pale
pretty
creature
in
a
white
wrapper
and
blue
net
sitting
in
a
large
chair
looking
about
her
with
the
languid
interest
of
an
invalid
in
a
new
place
her
eyes
brightened
as
they
fell
upon
a
glass
of
rosy
laurel
and
delicate
maidenhair
fern
that
stood
among
the
toast
and
eggs
strawberries
and
cream
on
the
tray
our
laurel
is
jest
in
blow
and
i
real
glad
you
come
in
time
to
see
it
i
bring
you
a
lot
as
soon
ever
i
get
time
to
go
for
as
she
spoke
the
plain
girl
replaced
the
ugly
crockery
cup
and
saucer
with
the
pretty
china
ones
pointed
out
to
her
arranged
the
dishes
and
waited
to
see
if
anything
else
was
needed
what
is
your
name
please
asked
the
pretty
girl
refreshing
herself
with
a
draught
of
new
milk
rebecca
mother
thought
i
better
wait
on
you
the
little
girls
are
so
noisy
and
apt
to
forget
would
you
like
a
piller
to
your
back
you
look
so
kind
of
feeble
seems
as
if
you
wanted
to
be
propped
up
a
there
was
so
much
compassion
and
in
the
face
and
voice
that
emily
accepted
the
offer
and
let
rebecca
arrange
a
cushion
behind
her
then
while
the
one
ate
daintily
and
the
other
stirred
about
an
inner
room
the
talk
went
on
for
two
girls
are
seldom
long
silent
when
together
i
think
the
air
is
going
to
suit
me
for
i
slept
all
night
and
never
woke
till
mamma
had
been
up
ever
so
long
and
got
things
all
nicely
settled
said
emily
graciously
when
the
fresh
strawberries
had
been
enjoyed
and
the
bread
and
butter
began
to
vanish
i
real
glad
you
like
it
most
folks
do
if
they
do
mind
it
being
plain
and
quiet
up
here
it
gayer
down
at
the
hotel
but
the
air
ai
half
so
good
and
delicate
folks
generally
like
our
old
place
best
answered
becky
as
she
tossed
over
a
mattress
and
shook
out
the
sheet
with
a
brisk
capable
air
pleasant
to
see
i
wanted
to
go
to
the
hotel
but
the
doctor
said
it
would
be
too
noisy
for
me
so
mamma
was
glad
to
find
rooms
here
i
did
think
a
could
be
so
pleasant
that
view
is
perfectly
splendid
and
emily
sat
up
to
gaze
delightedly
out
of
the
window
below
which
spread
the
wide
intervale
through
which
the
river
ran
with
on
either
side
while
along
the
green
slopes
of
the
hills
lay
with
garden
plots
and
big
barns
waiting
for
the
harvest
and
beyond
the
rocky
wooded
pastures
dotted
with
cattle
and
musical
with
brooks
and
birds
a
balmy
wind
kissed
a
little
color
into
the
pale
cheeks
the
listless
eyes
brightened
as
they
looked
and
the
fretful
lines
vanished
from
lips
that
smiled
involuntarily
at
the
sweet
welcome
nature
gave
the
city
child
come
to
rest
and
play
and
grow
gay
and
rosy
in
her
green
lap
becky
watched
her
with
interest
and
was
glad
to
see
how
soon
the
felt
the
charm
of
the
place
for
the
girl
loved
her
mountain
home
and
thought
the
old
the
loveliest
spot
in
the
world
when
you
get
stronger
i
can
show
you
lots
of
nice
views
round
here
there
a
woodsy
place
behind
the
house
that
just
lovely
down
by
the
laurel
bushes
is
my
favorite
spot
and
among
the
rocks
is
a
cave
where
i
keep
things
handy
when
i
get
a
now
and
then
and
want
to
be
quiet
ca
get
much
at
home
when
there
boarders
and
five
children
round
in
vacation
becky
laughed
as
she
spoke
and
there
was
a
sweet
motherly
look
in
her
plain
face
as
she
glanced
at
the
three
little
red
heads
bobbing
about
the
below
where
hens
cackled
a
pet
lamb
fed
and
the
old
white
dog
lay
blinking
in
the
sun
i
like
children
we
have
none
at
home
and
mamma
makes
such
a
baby
of
me
i
almost
ashamed
sometimes
i
want
her
to
have
a
good
rest
now
for
she
has
taken
care
of
me
all
winter
and
needs
it
you
shall
be
my
nurse
if
i
need
one
but
i
hope
to
be
so
well
soon
that
i
can
see
to
myself
it
so
tiresome
to
be
ill
and
emily
sighed
as
she
leaned
back
among
her
pillows
with
a
glance
at
the
little
glass
which
showed
her
a
thin
face
and
shorn
head
it
must
be
i
never
was
sick
but
i
have
taken
care
of
sick
folks
and
have
a
sight
of
sympathy
for
mother
says
i
make
a
pretty
good
nurse
being
strong
and
quiet
answered
becky
plumping
up
pillows
and
folding
towels
with
a
gentle
despatch
which
was
very
grateful
to
the
invalid
who
had
dreaded
a
noisy
awkward
never
ill
how
nice
that
must
be
i
always
having
colds
and
headaches
and
fusses
of
some
kind
what
do
you
do
to
keep
well
rebecca
asked
emily
watching
her
with
interest
as
she
came
in
to
remove
the
tray
nothing
but
work
i
have
time
to
be
sick
and
when
i
tuckered
out
i
go
and
rest
over
yonder
then
i
all
right
and
buckle
to
again
as
smart
as
ever
and
every
freckle
in
becky
rosy
face
seemed
to
shine
with
cheerful
strength
and
courage
i
out
doing
nothing
said
emily
amused
with
the
new
expression
and
eager
to
try
a
remedy
which
showed
such
fine
results
in
this
case
i
shall
visit
your
pet
places
and
do
a
little
work
as
soon
as
i
am
able
and
see
if
it
wo
set
me
up
now
i
can
only
dawdle
doze
and
read
a
little
will
you
please
put
those
books
here
on
the
table
i
shall
want
them
emily
pointed
to
a
pile
of
blue
and
gold
volumes
lying
on
a
trunk
and
becky
dusted
her
hands
as
she
took
them
up
with
an
air
of
reverence
for
she
read
on
the
backs
of
the
volumes
names
which
made
her
eyes
sparkle
do
you
care
for
poetry
asked
emily
surprised
at
the
girl
look
and
manner
guess
i
do
do
get
much
except
the
pieces
i
cut
out
of
papers
but
i
love
and
stick
in
an
old
ledger
and
keep
it
down
in
my
cubby
among
the
rocks
i
do
love
that
man
pieces
they
seem
to
go
right
to
the
spot
somehow
and
becky
smiled
at
the
name
of
whittier
as
if
the
sweetest
of
our
poets
was
a
dear
old
friend
of
hers
i
like
tennyson
better
do
you
know
him
asked
emily
with
a
superior
air
for
the
idea
of
this
farmer
daughter
knowing
anything
about
poetry
amused
her
oh
yes
i
got
a
number
of
his
pieces
in
my
book
and
i
fond
of
but
this
man
makes
things
so
kind
of
true
and
natural
i
feel
at
home
with
him
and
this
one
i
longed
to
read
though
i
guess
i
ca
understand
much
of
it
his
bee
was
just
lovely
with
the
grass
and
columbines
and
the
yellow
breeches
of
the
bee
never
tired
of
that
and
becky
face
woke
up
into
something
like
beauty
as
she
glanced
hungrily
at
the
emerson
while
she
dusted
the
delicate
cover
that
hid
the
treasures
she
coveted
i
do
care
much
for
him
but
mamma
does
i
like
romantic
poems
and
ballads
and
songs
do
like
descriptions
of
clouds
and
fields
and
bees
and
farmers
said
emily
showing
plainly
that
even
emerson
simplest
poems
were
far
above
her
comprehension
as
yet
because
she
loved
sentiment
more
than
nature
i
do
because
i
know
better
than
love
and
the
romantic
stuff
most
poetry
tells
about
but
i
do
pretend
to
judge
i
glad
of
anything
i
can
get
now
if
you
do
want
me
i
pick
up
my
dishes
and
go
to
with
that
becky
went
away
leaving
emily
to
rest
and
dream
with
her
eyes
on
the
landscape
which
was
giving
her
better
poetry
than
any
her
books
held
she
told
her
mother
about
the
odd
girl
and
was
sure
she
would
be
amusing
if
she
did
not
forget
her
place
and
try
to
be
friends
she
is
a
good
creature
my
dear
her
mother
main
stay
and
works
beyond
her
strength
i
am
sure
be
kind
to
the
poor
girl
and
put
a
little
pleasure
into
her
life
if
you
can
answered
spenser
as
she
moved
about
settling
comforts
and
luxuries
for
her
invalid
i
shall
have
to
talk
to
her
as
there
is
no
other
person
of
my
age
in
the
house
how
are
the
school
marms
shall
you
get
on
with
them
mamma
it
will
be
so
lonely
here
for
us
both
if
we
do
make
friends
with
some
most
intelligent
and
amiable
women
all
three
and
we
shall
have
pleasant
times
together
i
am
sure
you
may
safely
cultivate
becky
taylor
told
me
she
was
a
remarkably
bright
girl
though
she
may
not
look
well
i
see
but
i
do
hate
freckles
and
big
red
hands
and
round
shoulders
she
ca
help
it
i
suppose
but
ugly
things
fret
remember
that
she
has
no
time
to
be
pretty
and
be
glad
she
is
so
neat
and
willing
shall
we
read
dear
i
ready
emily
consented
and
listened
for
an
hour
or
two
while
the
pleasant
voice
beside
her
conjured
away
all
her
vapors
with
some
of
ewing
charming
tales
the
grass
is
dry
now
and
i
want
to
stroll
on
that
green
lawn
before
lunch
you
rest
mamma
dear
and
let
me
make
discoveries
all
alone
proposed
emily
when
the
sun
shone
warmly
and
the
instinct
of
all
young
creatures
for
air
and
motion
called
her
out
so
with
her
hat
and
wrap
and
book
and
parasol
she
set
forth
to
explore
the
new
land
in
which
she
found
herself
down
the
wide
creaking
stairs
and
out
upon
the
she
went
pausing
there
for
a
moment
to
decide
where
first
to
go
the
sound
of
some
one
singing
in
the
rear
of
the
house
led
her
in
that
direction
and
turning
the
corner
she
made
her
first
pleasant
discovery
a
hill
rose
steeply
behind
the
and
leaning
from
the
bank
was
an
old
shading
a
spring
that
trickled
out
from
the
rocks
and
dropped
into
a
mossy
trough
below
up
the
tree
had
grown
a
wild
making
a
green
canopy
over
the
great
log
which
served
as
a
seat
and
some
one
had
planted
maidenhair
ferns
about
both
seat
and
spring
to
flourish
beautifully
in
the
damp
shady
spot
oh
how
pretty
i
go
and
sit
there
it
looks
clean
and
i
can
see
what
is
going
on
in
that
big
kitchen
and
hear
the
singing
i
suppose
it
becky
little
sisters
by
the
emily
established
herself
on
the
log
with
her
feet
upon
a
stone
and
sat
enjoying
the
musical
tinkle
of
the
water
with
her
eyes
on
the
delicate
ferns
stirring
in
the
wind
and
the
lively
jingle
of
the
chanted
by
childish
voices
in
her
ear
presently
two
little
girls
with
a
great
pan
of
beans
came
to
do
their
work
on
the
back
doorstep
a
third
was
seen
washing
dishes
at
a
window
and
becky
gown
flew
about
the
kitchen
as
if
a
very
energetic
girl
wore
it
a
woman
voice
was
heard
giving
directions
as
the
speaker
was
evidently
picking
chickens
somewhere
out
of
sight
a
little
of
the
talk
reached
emily
and
both
amused
and
annoyed
her
for
it
proved
that
the
country
people
were
not
as
stupid
as
they
looked
oh
well
we
must
mind
if
she
is
notional
and
kind
of
wearing
she
been
sick
and
it
will
take
time
to
get
rid
of
her
fretty
ways
jest
be
pleasant
and
take
no
notice
and
that
nice
mother
of
hers
will
make
it
all
right
said
the
woman
voice
how
anybody
with
every
mortal
thing
to
be
happy
with
can
be
passes
me
she
fussed
about
every
piller
chair
trunk
and
mite
of
food
last
night
and
kept
that
poor
tired
lady
trotting
till
i
was
provoked
she
right
pleasant
this
morning
though
and
as
pretty
as
a
picture
in
her
ruffled
gown
and
that
blue
thing
on
her
head
answered
becky
from
the
pantry
as
she
rattled
out
the
little
dreaming
who
sat
hidden
behind
the
festoons
that
veiled
the
corner
by
the
spring
well
she
got
redder
hair
we
have
so
she
need
be
so
grand
and
try
to
hide
it
with
blue
nets
added
one
little
voice
yes
and
it
ever
so
much
shorter
ours
and
curls
all
over
her
head
like
daisy
wool
i
should
think
such
a
big
girl
would
feel
real
ashamed
without
no
braids
said
the
other
child
proudly
surveying
the
tawny
mane
that
hung
over
her
shoulders
for
like
most
people
all
the
children
were
blessed
with
luxuriant
crops
of
every
shade
from
golden
auburn
to
regular
carrots
i
think
it
lovely
suppose
it
had
to
be
cut
off
when
she
had
the
fever
wish
i
could
get
rid
of
my
mop
it
such
a
bother
and
becky
was
seen
tying
a
clean
towel
over
the
great
knot
that
made
her
head
look
very
like
a
copper
kettle
now
fly
round
deary
and
get
them
pies
ready
i
have
these
fowls
on
in
a
minute
and
then
go
to
my
butter
you
run
off
and
see
if
you
ca
find
some
wild
strawberries
for
the
poor
girl
ever
you
are
through
with
them
beans
children
we
must
kind
of
pamper
her
up
for
a
spell
till
her
appetite
comes
back
said
the
mother
here
the
chat
ended
and
soon
the
little
girls
were
gone
leaving
becky
alone
rolling
out
before
the
pantry
window
as
she
worked
her
lips
moved
and
emily
still
peeping
through
the
leaves
wondered
what
she
was
saying
for
a
low
murmur
rose
and
fell
emphasized
now
and
then
with
a
thump
of
the
i
mean
to
go
and
find
out
if
i
stand
on
that
i
can
look
in
and
see
her
work
i
show
them
all
that
not
and
can
be
pleasant
if
i
with
this
wise
resolution
emily
went
down
the
little
path
and
after
pausing
to
examine
the
churn
set
out
to
dry
and
the
row
of
pans
shining
on
a
neighboring
shelf
made
her
way
to
the
window
mounted
the
bench
while
becky
back
was
turned
and
pushing
away
the
vines
and
scarlet
beans
that
ran
up
on
either
side
peeped
in
with
such
a
smiling
face
that
the
crossest
cook
could
not
have
frowned
on
her
as
an
intruder
may
i
see
you
work
i
ca
eat
pies
but
i
like
to
watch
people
make
them
do
you
mind
not
a
bit
i
ask
you
to
come
in
but
it
dreadful
hot
here
and
not
much
room
answered
becky
crimping
round
the
pastry
before
she
poured
in
the
custard
i
going
to
make
a
nice
little
pudding
for
you
your
mother
said
you
liked
or
would
you
rather
have
whipped
cream
with
a
mite
of
jelly
in
it
asked
becky
anxious
to
suit
her
new
boarder
whichever
is
easiest
to
make
i
do
care
what
i
eat
do
tell
me
what
you
were
saying
it
sounded
like
poetry
said
emily
leaning
both
elbows
on
the
wide
ledge
with
a
pale
pink
kissing
her
cheek
and
a
savory
odor
reaching
her
nose
oh
i
was
mumbling
some
verses
i
often
do
when
i
work
it
sort
of
helps
me
along
but
it
must
sound
dreadfully
silly
and
becky
blushed
as
if
caught
in
some
serious
fault
i
do
it
and
it
a
great
comfort
when
i
lie
awake
i
should
think
you
would
want
something
to
help
you
along
you
work
so
hard
do
you
like
it
becky
the
familiar
name
the
kind
tone
made
the
plain
face
brighten
with
pleasure
as
its
owner
said
while
she
carefully
filled
a
pretty
bowl
with
a
golden
mixture
rich
with
fresh
eggs
and
country
milk
no
i
do
but
i
ought
to
mother
is
as
strong
as
she
used
to
be
and
there
a
sight
to
do
and
the
children
to
be
brought
up
and
the
mortgage
to
be
paid
off
so
if
do
fly
round
who
will
we
are
doing
real
well
now
for
walker
manages
the
farm
and
gives
us
our
share
so
our
living
is
all
right
then
boarders
in
summer
and
my
school
in
winter
helps
a
deal
and
every
year
the
boys
can
do
more
so
i
be
a
real
sinner
to
complain
if
i
do
have
to
step
lively
all
becky
smiled
as
she
spoke
and
straightened
her
bent
shoulders
as
if
settling
her
burden
for
another
trudge
along
the
path
of
duty
do
you
keep
school
why
how
old
are
you
becky
asked
emily
much
impressed
by
this
new
discovery
i
eighteen
i
took
the
place
of
a
teacher
who
got
sick
last
fall
and
i
kept
school
all
winter
folks
seemed
to
like
me
and
i
going
to
have
the
same
place
this
year
i
so
glad
for
i
need
go
away
and
the
pay
is
pretty
good
as
the
school
is
large
and
the
children
do
well
you
can
see
the
down
the
valley
that
red
brick
one
where
the
roads
meet
and
becky
pointed
a
floury
finger
with
an
air
of
pride
that
was
pleasant
to
see
emily
glanced
at
the
little
red
house
where
the
sun
shone
hotly
in
summer
and
all
the
winds
of
heaven
must
rage
wildly
in
winter
time
for
it
stood
as
country
schools
usually
do
in
the
barest
most
uninviting
spot
for
miles
around
is
it
awful
down
there
in
winter
she
asked
with
a
shiver
at
the
idea
of
spending
days
shut
up
in
that
forlorn
place
with
a
crowd
of
rough
country
children
pretty
cold
but
we
have
plenty
of
wood
and
we
are
used
to
snow
and
gales
up
here
we
often
coast
down
the
whole
lot
of
us
and
that
is
great
fun
we
take
our
dinners
and
have
games
and
so
we
get
on
first
rate
some
of
my
boys
are
big
fellows
older
than
i
am
they
clear
the
roads
and
make
the
fire
and
look
after
us
and
we
are
real
happy
emily
found
it
so
impossible
to
imagine
happiness
under
such
circumstances
that
she
changed
the
subject
by
asking
in
a
tone
which
had
unconsciously
grown
more
respectful
since
this
last
revelation
of
becky
abilities
if
you
do
so
well
here
why
do
you
try
for
a
larger
school
in
a
better
place
oh
i
could
leave
mother
yet
i
hope
to
some
day
when
the
girls
are
older
and
the
boys
able
to
get
on
alone
but
i
ca
go
now
for
there
a
sight
of
things
to
do
and
mother
is
always
laid
up
with
rheumatism
in
cold
weather
so
much
down
cellar
is
bad
for
her
but
she
wo
let
me
do
that
in
summer
so
i
take
care
of
her
in
winter
i
can
see
to
things
night
and
morning
and
through
the
day
she
quiet
and
sits
piecing
and
resting
up
for
next
spring
we
made
and
wove
all
the
carpets
in
the
house
except
the
parlor
one
taylor
gave
us
that
and
the
curtains
and
the
mother
takes
a
sight
of
comfort
in
mrs
taylor
is
the
lady
who
first
came
to
board
here
and
told
us
and
others
about
it
said
emily
yes
and
she
the
kindest
lady
in
the
world
i
tell
you
all
about
her
some
day
it
real
interesting
now
i
must
see
to
my
pies
and
get
the
vegetables
on
answered
becky
glancing
at
the
gay
clock
in
the
kitchen
with
an
anxious
look
then
i
wo
waste
any
more
of
your
precious
time
may
i
sit
in
that
pretty
place
or
is
it
your
private
bower
asked
emily
as
she
dismounted
from
the
yes
indeed
you
may
that
mother
when
work
is
done
father
made
the
spring
long
ago
and
i
put
the
ferns
there
she
ca
go
rambling
round
and
she
likes
pretty
things
so
we
fixed
it
up
for
her
and
she
takes
comfort
there
becky
bustled
off
to
the
oven
with
her
pies
and
emily
roamed
away
to
the
big
barn
to
lie
on
the
hay
enjoying
the
view
down
the
valley
as
she
thought
over
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
and
very
naturally
contrasted
her
own
luxurious
and
tenderly
guarded
life
with
this
other
girl
so
hard
and
dull
and
narrow
working
all
summer
and
teaching
all
winter
in
that
dismal
little
with
no
change
but
home
cares
and
it
looked
horrible
to
emily
who
led
the
happy
life
of
girls
of
her
class
with
pleasures
of
all
sorts
and
a
future
of
still
greater
luxury
variety
and
happiness
opening
brightly
before
her
it
worried
her
to
think
of
any
one
being
contented
with
such
a
meagre
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
when
she
was
unsatisfied
in
spite
of
the
rich
store
showered
upon
her
she
could
not
understand
it
and
fell
asleep
wishing
every
one
could
be
comfortable
it
was
so
annoying
to
see
them
grubbing
in
kitchens
teaching
in
bleak
among
and
wearing
ugly
calico
gowns
a
week
or
two
of
quiet
country
fare
and
the
bracing
mountain
air
worked
wonders
for
the
invalid
and
every
one
rejoiced
to
see
the
pale
cheeks
begin
to
grow
round
and
rosy
the
languid
eyes
to
brighten
and
the
feeble
girl
who
used
to
lie
on
her
sofa
half
the
day
now
go
walking
about
with
her
alpenstock
eager
to
explore
all
the
pretty
nooks
among
the
hills
her
mother
blessed
taylor
for
suggesting
this
wholesome
place
the
tired
school
marms
as
emily
called
the
three
young
women
who
were
their
congratulated
her
as
well
as
themselves
on
the
daily
improvement
in
strength
and
spirits
all
felt
and
becky
exulted
in
the
marvellous
effects
of
her
native
air
aided
by
mother
good
cookery
and
the
cheerful
society
of
the
children
whom
the
good
girl
considered
the
most
remarkable
and
lovable
youngsters
in
the
world
emily
felt
like
the
queen
of
this
little
kingdom
and
was
regarded
as
such
by
every
one
for
with
returning
health
she
lost
her
fretful
ways
and
living
with
simple
people
soon
forgot
her
girlish
airs
and
vanities
becoming
very
sweet
and
friendly
with
all
about
her
the
children
considered
her
a
sort
of
good
fairy
who
could
grant
wishes
with
magical
skill
as
various
gifts
plainly
proved
the
boys
were
her
devoted
servants
ready
to
run
errands
hitch
up
and
take
her
to
drive
at
any
hour
or
listen
in
mute
delight
when
she
sang
to
her
guitar
in
the
summer
twilight
but
to
becky
she
was
a
special
godsend
and
comfort
for
before
the
first
month
had
gone
they
were
good
friends
and
emily
had
made
a
discovery
which
filled
her
head
with
brilliant
plans
for
future
in
spite
of
her
mother
warnings
and
the
sensible
girl
own
reluctance
to
be
dazzled
by
enthusiastic
prophecies
and
dreams
it
came
about
in
this
way
some
three
weeks
after
the
two
girls
met
emily
went
one
evening
to
their
favorite
bower
among
the
laurels
it
was
a
pretty
nook
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
gray
bowlder
near
the
head
of
the
green
valley
which
ran
down
to
spread
into
the
wide
intervale
below
a
brook
went
babbling
among
the
stones
and
grass
and
while
all
the
slope
was
rosy
with
in
their
times
as
the
sturdy
bushes
grew
thickly
on
the
down
the
valley
and
among
the
woods
that
made
a
rich
background
for
these
pink
and
white
bouquets
arranged
with
nature
own
careless
grace
emily
liked
this
spot
and
ever
since
she
had
been
strong
enough
to
reach
it
loved
to
climb
up
and
sit
there
with
book
and
work
enjoying
the
lovely
panorama
before
her
floating
mists
often
gave
her
a
constant
succession
of
pretty
pictures
now
a
sunny
glimpse
of
the
distant
lake
then
the
church
spire
peeping
above
the
hill
or
a
flock
of
sheep
feeding
in
the
meadow
a
gay
procession
of
young
pilgrims
winding
up
the
mountain
or
a
black
cloud
heavy
with
a
coming
storm
welcome
because
of
the
glorious
rainbow
and
its
shadow
which
would
close
the
pageant
unconsciously
the
girl
grew
to
feel
not
only
the
beauty
but
the
value
of
these
quiet
hours
to
find
a
new
peace
refreshment
and
happiness
bubbling
up
in
her
heart
as
naturally
as
the
brook
gushed
out
among
the
mossy
rocks
and
went
singing
away
through
hayfields
and
gardens
and
by
dusty
roads
till
it
met
the
river
and
rolled
on
to
the
sea
something
dimly
stirred
in
her
and
the
healing
spirit
that
haunts
such
spots
did
its
sweet
ministering
till
the
innocent
soul
began
to
see
that
life
was
not
perfect
without
labor
as
well
as
love
duty
as
well
as
happiness
and
that
true
contentment
came
from
within
not
from
without
on
the
evening
we
speak
of
she
went
to
wait
for
becky
who
would
join
her
as
soon
as
the
chores
were
done
in
the
little
cave
which
held
a
few
books
a
dipper
and
a
basket
for
berries
emily
kept
a
sketching
block
and
a
box
of
pencils
and
often
amused
herself
by
trying
to
catch
some
of
the
lovely
scenes
before
her
these
efforts
usually
ended
in
a
humbler
attempt
and
a
good
study
of
an
a
bit
of
rock
or
a
clump
of
ferns
was
the
result
this
evening
the
sunset
was
so
beautiful
she
could
not
draw
and
remembering
that
somewhere
in
becky
there
was
a
fine
description
of
such
an
hour
by
some
poet
she
pulled
out
the
shabby
old
volume
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
she
had
never
cared
to
look
at
it
but
once
having
read
all
the
best
of
its
contents
in
more
attractive
volumes
so
becky
kept
it
tucked
away
in
the
farther
corner
of
her
rustic
closet
and
evidently
thought
it
a
safe
place
to
conceal
a
certain
little
secret
which
emily
now
discovered
as
she
turned
the
stiff
pages
filled
with
all
sorts
of
verses
good
bad
and
indifferent
a
sheet
of
paper
appeared
on
which
was
scribbled
these
lines
in
handwriting
mountain
laurel
my
bonnie
flower
with
truest
joy
thy
welcome
face
i
see
the
world
grows
brighter
to
my
eyes
and
summer
comes
with
thee
my
solitude
now
finds
a
friend
and
after
each
hard
day
i
in
my
mountain
garden
walk
to
rest
or
sing
or
pray
all
down
the
rocky
slope
is
spread
thy
veil
of
rosy
snow
and
in
the
valley
by
the
brook
thy
deeper
blossoms
grow
the
barren
wilderness
grows
fair
such
beauty
dost
thou
give
and
human
eyes
and
nature
heart
rejoice
that
thou
dost
live
each
year
i
wait
thy
coming
dear
each
year
i
love
thee
more
for
life
grows
hard
and
much
i
need
thy
honey
for
my
store
so
like
a
hungry
bee
i
sip
sweet
lessons
from
thy
cup
and
sitting
at
a
flower
feet
my
soul
learns
to
look
up
no
laurels
shall
i
ever
win
no
splendid
blossoms
bear
but
gratefully
receive
and
use
god
blessed
sun
and
air
and
blooming
where
my
lot
is
cast
grow
happy
and
content
making
some
barren
spot
more
fair
for
a
humble
life
well
spent
she
wrote
it
herself
i
ca
believe
it
said
emily
as
she
put
down
the
paper
looking
rather
startled
for
she
did
believe
it
and
felt
as
if
she
had
suddenly
looked
into
a
heart
i
thought
her
just
an
ordinary
girl
and
here
she
is
a
poet
writing
verses
that
make
me
want
to
cry
i
do
suppose
they
are
very
good
but
they
seem
to
come
right
out
of
her
heart
and
touch
me
with
the
longing
and
the
patience
or
the
piety
in
them
well
i
am
surprised
and
emily
read
the
lines
again
seeing
the
faults
more
plainly
than
before
but
still
feeling
that
the
girl
put
herself
into
them
vainly
trying
to
express
what
the
wild
flower
was
to
her
in
the
loneliness
which
comes
to
those
who
have
a
little
spark
of
the
divine
fire
burning
in
their
souls
shall
i
tell
her
i
found
it
out
i
must
and
see
if
i
ca
get
her
verses
printed
of
course
she
has
more
tucked
away
somewhere
that
is
what
she
hums
to
herself
when
she
at
work
and
wo
tell
me
about
when
i
ask
sly
thing
to
be
so
bashful
and
hide
her
gift
i
tease
her
a
bit
and
see
what
she
says
oh
dear
i
wish
could
do
it
perhaps
she
be
famous
some
day
and
then
i
have
the
glory
of
discovering
with
that
consolation
emily
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
ledger
and
found
several
more
bits
of
verse
some
very
good
for
an
untaught
girl
others
very
faulty
but
all
having
a
certain
strength
of
feeling
and
simplicity
of
language
unusual
in
the
effusions
of
young
maidens
at
the
sentimental
age
emily
had
a
girlish
admiration
for
talent
of
any
kind
and
being
fond
of
poetry
was
especially
pleased
to
find
that
her
humble
friend
possessed
the
power
of
writing
it
of
course
she
exaggerated
becky
talent
and
as
she
waited
for
her
felt
sure
that
she
had
discovered
a
feminine
burns
among
the
new
hampshire
hills
for
all
the
verses
were
about
natural
and
homely
objects
touched
into
beauty
by
sweet
words
or
tender
sentiment
she
had
time
to
build
a
splendid
castle
in
the
air
and
settle
becky
in
it
with
a
crown
of
glory
on
her
head
before
the
quiet
figure
in
a
faded
sunbonnet
came
slowly
up
the
slope
with
the
glow
of
sunset
on
a
tired
but
tranquil
face
sit
here
and
have
a
good
rest
while
i
talk
to
you
said
emily
eager
to
act
the
somewhat
dramatic
scene
she
had
planned
becky
sunk
upon
the
red
cushion
prepared
for
her
and
sat
looking
down
at
the
animated
speaker
as
emily
perched
on
a
mossy
stone
before
her
began
the
performance
becky
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
goodale
children
they
lived
in
the
country
and
wrote
poetry
and
grew
to
be
oh
yes
i
read
their
poems
and
like
very
much
do
you
know
and
becky
looked
interested
at
once
no
but
i
once
met
a
girl
who
was
something
like
them
only
she
did
have
such
an
easy
time
as
they
did
with
a
father
to
help
and
a
nice
and
good
luck
generally
i
tried
to
write
verses
myself
but
i
always
get
into
a
muddle
and
give
it
up
this
makes
me
interested
in
other
girls
who
can
do
it
and
i
want
to
help
my
friend
i
sure
she
has
talent
and
i
so
like
to
give
her
a
lift
in
some
way
let
me
read
you
a
piece
of
hers
and
see
what
you
think
of
do
and
beck
threw
off
the
sunbonnet
folded
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
composed
herself
to
listen
with
such
perfect
unconsciousness
of
what
was
coming
that
emily
both
laughed
at
the
joke
and
blushed
at
the
liberty
she
felt
she
was
taking
with
the
poor
girl
carefully
hidden
secret
becky
was
sure
now
that
emily
was
going
to
read
something
of
her
own
after
this
artful
introduction
and
began
to
smile
as
the
paper
was
produced
and
the
first
four
lines
read
in
a
tone
that
was
half
timid
half
triumphant
then
with
a
cry
she
seized
and
crumpled
up
the
paper
exclaiming
almost
fiercely
it
mine
where
did
you
get
it
how
you
touch
it
emily
fell
upon
her
knees
with
a
face
and
voice
so
full
of
penitence
pleasure
sympathy
and
satisfaction
that
becky
wrath
was
appeased
before
her
friend
explanation
ended
with
these
soothing
and
delightful
words
that
all
dear
and
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
sure
you
will
be
famous
if
you
keep
on
and
i
shall
yet
see
a
volume
of
poems
by
rebecca
moore
of
rocky
nook
new
becky
hid
her
face
as
if
shame
surprise
wonder
and
joy
filled
her
heart
too
full
and
made
a
few
happy
tears
drop
on
the
hands
so
worn
with
hard
work
when
they
ached
to
be
holding
a
pen
and
trying
to
record
the
fancies
that
sung
in
her
brain
as
ceaselessly
as
the
soft
sough
of
the
pines
or
the
ripple
of
the
brook
murmured
in
her
ear
when
she
sat
here
alone
she
could
not
express
the
vague
longings
that
stirred
in
her
soul
she
could
only
feel
and
dimly
strive
to
understand
and
utter
them
with
no
thought
of
fame
or
fortune
for
she
was
a
humble
creature
and
never
knew
that
the
hardships
of
her
life
were
pressing
out
the
virtues
of
her
nature
as
the
tread
of
careless
feet
crush
the
sweet
perfume
from
wild
herbs
presently
she
looked
up
deeply
touched
by
emily
words
and
caresses
and
her
blue
eyes
shone
like
stars
as
her
face
beamed
with
something
finer
than
mere
beauty
for
the
secrets
of
her
innocent
heart
were
known
to
this
friend
now
and
it
was
very
sweet
to
accept
the
first
draught
of
confidence
and
praise
i
do
mind
much
but
i
was
scared
for
a
minute
no
one
knows
but
mother
and
she
laughs
at
me
though
she
do
care
if
it
makes
me
happy
i
glad
you
like
my
scribbling
but
really
i
never
think
or
hope
of
being
anybody
i
could
you
know
but
it
real
nice
to
have
you
say
i
might
and
to
make
believe
for
a
but
why
not
becky
the
goodale
girls
did
and
half
the
poets
in
the
world
were
poor
ignorant
people
at
first
you
know
it
only
needs
time
and
help
and
the
gift
will
grow
and
people
see
it
and
then
the
glory
and
the
money
will
come
cried
emily
quite
carried
away
by
her
own
enthusiasm
and
could
i
get
any
money
by
these
things
asked
becky
looking
at
the
crumpled
paper
lying
under
a
of
course
you
could
dear
let
me
have
some
of
them
and
i
show
you
that
i
know
good
poetry
when
i
see
it
you
will
believe
if
some
come
with
the
paper
the
verses
appear
in
i
hope
blind
to
any
harm
she
might
do
by
exciting
vain
hopes
in
her
eagerness
to
cheer
and
help
emily
made
this
rash
proposal
in
all
good
faith
meaning
to
pay
for
the
verses
herself
if
no
editor
was
found
to
accept
them
becky
looked
half
bewildered
by
this
brilliant
prospect
and
took
a
long
breath
as
if
some
hand
had
lifted
a
heavy
burden
a
little
way
from
her
weary
back
for
stronger
than
ambition
for
herself
was
love
for
her
family
and
the
thought
of
help
for
them
was
sweeter
than
any
dream
of
fame
yes
i
would
oh
if
i
only
could
i
be
the
happiest
girl
in
the
world
but
i
ca
believe
it
emily
i
heard
taylor
say
that
only
the
very
best
poetry
paid
and
mine
is
poor
stuff
i
know
well
of
course
it
needs
polishing
and
practice
and
all
that
but
sure
it
is
oceans
better
than
half
the
sentimental
twaddle
we
see
in
the
papers
and
i
know
that
some
of
those
pieces
are
paid
for
because
i
have
a
friend
who
is
in
a
newspaper
office
and
he
told
me
so
yours
are
quaint
and
simple
and
some
very
original
i
sure
that
ballad
of
the
old
house
is
lovely
and
i
want
to
send
it
to
whittier
mamma
knows
him
it
the
sort
he
likes
and
he
is
so
kind
to
every
one
he
will
criticise
it
and
be
interested
when
she
tells
him
about
you
do
let
me
i
never
could
in
the
world
it
would
be
so
bold
mother
would
think
i
was
crazy
i
love
whittier
but
i
would
to
show
him
my
nonsense
though
reading
his
beautiful
poetry
helps
me
ever
so
becky
looked
and
spoke
as
if
her
breath
had
been
taken
away
by
this
audacious
proposal
and
yet
a
sudden
delicious
hope
sprung
up
in
her
heart
that
there
might
perhaps
be
a
spark
of
real
virtue
in
the
little
fire
which
burned
within
her
warming
and
brightening
her
dull
life
let
us
ask
mamma
she
will
tell
us
what
is
best
to
do
first
for
she
knows
all
sorts
of
literary
people
and
wo
say
any
more
than
you
want
her
to
i
bent
on
having
my
way
becky
and
the
more
modest
you
are
the
surer
i
am
that
you
are
a
genius
real
geniuses
always
are
shy
so
you
just
make
up
your
mind
to
give
me
the
best
of
your
pieces
and
let
me
prove
that
i
it
was
impossible
to
resist
such
persuasive
words
and
becky
soon
yielded
to
the
little
siren
who
was
luring
her
out
of
her
safe
small
pool
into
the
deeper
water
that
looks
so
blue
and
smooth
till
the
venturesome
paper
boats
get
into
the
swift
eddies
or
run
aground
upon
the
rocks
and
sandbars
the
greatest
secrecy
was
to
be
preserved
and
no
one
but
spenser
was
to
know
what
a
momentous
enterprise
was
afoot
the
girls
sat
absorbed
in
their
brilliant
plans
till
it
was
nearly
dark
then
groped
their
way
home
hand
in
hand
leaving
another
secret
for
the
laurels
to
keep
and
dream
over
through
their
long
sleep
for
blossom
time
was
past
and
the
rosy
faces
turning
pale
in
the
july
sun
neither
of
the
girls
forgot
the
talk
they
had
that
night
in
room
for
she
led
her
captive
straight
to
her
mother
and
told
her
all
their
plans
and
aspirations
without
a
moment
delay
spenser
much
regretted
her
daughter
enthusiasm
but
fearing
harm
might
be
done
very
wisely
tried
to
calm
the
innocent
excitement
of
both
by
the
quiet
way
in
which
she
listened
to
the
explanation
emily
gave
her
read
the
verses
timidly
offered
by
becky
and
then
said
kindly
but
firmly
this
is
not
poetry
my
dear
girls
though
the
lines
run
smoothly
enough
and
the
sentiment
is
sweet
it
would
bring
neither
fame
nor
money
and
rebecca
puts
more
real
truth
beauty
and
poetry
into
her
dutiful
daily
life
than
in
any
lines
she
has
we
had
such
a
lovely
plan
for
becky
to
come
to
town
with
me
and
see
the
world
and
write
and
be
famous
how
can
you
spoil
it
all
my
foolish
little
daughter
i
must
prevent
you
from
spoiling
this
good
girl
life
by
your
rash
projects
becky
will
see
that
i
am
wise
though
you
do
not
and
she
will
understand
this
verse
from
my
favorite
poet
and
lay
it
to
heart
so
near
is
grandeur
to
our
dust
so
nigh
is
god
to
man
when
duty
whispers
low
must
the
youth
replies
can
i
do
i
will
please
go
on
and
becky
troubled
eyes
grew
clear
and
steadfast
as
she
took
the
words
home
to
herself
resolving
to
live
up
to
them
oh
mother
cried
emily
thinking
her
very
cruel
to
nip
their
budding
hopes
in
this
way
i
know
you
wo
believe
it
now
nor
be
able
to
see
all
that
i
mean
perhaps
but
time
will
teach
you
both
to
own
that
i
am
right
and
to
value
the
substance
more
than
the
shadow
continued
spenser
many
girls
write
verses
and
think
they
are
poets
but
it
is
only
a
passing
mood
and
fortunately
for
the
world
and
for
them
also
it
soon
dies
out
in
some
more
genuine
work
or
passion
very
few
have
the
real
gift
and
those
to
whom
it
is
given
wait
and
work
and
slowly
reach
the
height
of
their
powers
many
delude
themselves
and
try
to
persuade
the
world
that
they
can
sing
but
it
is
waste
of
time
and
ends
in
disappointment
as
the
mass
of
sentimental
rubbish
we
all
see
plainly
proves
write
your
little
verses
my
dear
when
the
spirit
moves
it
is
a
harmless
pleasure
a
real
comfort
and
a
good
lesson
for
you
but
do
not
neglect
higher
duties
or
deceive
yourself
with
false
hopes
and
vain
dreams
live
then
write
is
a
good
motto
for
ambitious
young
people
a
still
better
for
us
all
is
the
duty
that
lies
nearest
and
the
faithful
performance
of
that
no
matter
how
humble
it
is
will
be
the
best
help
for
whatever
talent
may
lie
hidden
in
us
ready
to
bloom
when
the
time
comes
remember
this
and
do
not
let
my
enthusiastic
but
unwise
prophecies
and
plans
unsettle
you
and
unfit
you
for
the
noble
work
you
are
thank
you
i
will
remember
i
know
you
are
right
and
i
wo
be
upset
by
foolish
notions
i
never
imagined
before
that
i
could
be
a
poet
but
it
sounded
so
sort
of
splendid
i
thought
maybe
it
might
happen
to
me
as
it
does
to
other
folks
i
wo
lot
on
it
but
settle
right
down
and
do
my
work
as
she
listened
becky
face
had
grown
pale
and
serious
even
a
little
sad
but
as
she
answered
her
eyes
shone
her
lips
were
firm
and
her
plain
face
almost
beautiful
with
the
courage
and
confidence
that
sprung
up
within
her
she
saw
the
wisdom
of
her
advice
felt
the
kindness
of
showing
her
the
mistake
frankly
and
was
grateful
for
it
conscious
in
her
own
strong
loving
heart
that
it
was
better
to
live
and
work
for
others
than
to
dream
and
strive
for
herself
alone
spenser
was
both
surprised
and
touched
by
the
girl
look
words
and
manner
and
her
respect
much
increased
by
the
courage
and
good
temper
with
which
she
saw
her
lovely
castle
in
the
air
vanish
like
smoke
leaving
the
hard
reality
looking
harder
than
ever
after
this
little
flight
into
the
fairy
regions
of
romance
she
talked
long
with
the
girls
and
gave
them
the
counsel
all
eager
young
people
need
yet
are
very
slow
to
accept
till
experience
teaches
them
its
worth
as
the
friend
of
many
successful
literary
people
spenser
was
constantly
receiving
the
confidences
of
unfledged
scribblers
each
of
whom
was
sure
that
he
or
she
had
something
valuable
to
add
to
the
world
literature
her
advice
was
always
the
same
work
and
wait
and
only
now
and
then
was
a
young
poet
or
author
found
enough
in
earnest
to
do
both
and
thereby
prove
to
themselves
and
others
that
either
they
did
possess
power
or
did
not
and
so
settle
the
question
forever
first
live
then
write
proved
a
quietus
for
many
and
do
the
duty
that
lies
nearest
satisfied
the
more
sincere
that
they
could
be
happy
without
fame
so
thanks
to
this
wise
and
kindly
woman
a
large
number
of
worthy
youths
and
maidens
ceased
dreaming
and
fell
to
work
and
the
world
was
spared
reams
of
feeble
verse
and
romances
after
that
night
becky
spent
fewer
spare
hours
in
her
nest
and
more
in
reading
with
emily
who
lent
her
books
and
helped
her
to
understand
them
both
much
assisted
by
spenser
who
marked
passages
suggested
authors
and
explained
whatever
puzzled
them
very
happy
bits
of
time
were
these
and
very
precious
to
both
as
emily
learned
to
see
and
appreciate
the
humbler
harder
side
of
life
and
becky
got
delightful
glimpses
into
the
beautiful
world
of
art
poetry
and
truth
which
gave
her
better
food
for
heart
and
brain
than
sentimental
musings
or
blind
efforts
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
her
nature
with
their
favorite
places
were
in
the
big
barn
on
the
front
porch
or
by
the
spring
this
last
was
emily
schoolroom
and
she
both
taught
and
learned
many
useful
lessons
there
one
day
as
becky
came
to
rest
a
few
minutes
and
shell
peas
emily
put
down
her
book
to
help
and
as
the
pods
flew
she
said
nodding
toward
the
delicate
ferns
that
grew
thickly
all
about
the
trough
the
rock
and
the
grassy
bank
we
have
these
in
our
greenhouse
but
i
never
saw
them
growing
wild
before
and
i
do
find
them
anywhere
up
here
how
did
you
get
such
beauties
and
make
them
do
so
well
oh
they
grow
in
nooks
on
the
mountain
hidden
under
the
taller
ferns
and
in
sly
corners
but
they
do
grow
like
these
and
die
soon
unless
transplanted
and
taken
good
care
of
they
always
make
me
think
of
you
so
graceful
and
delicate
and
just
fit
to
live
with
in
a
and
go
to
balls
in
beautiful
bokays
answered
becky
smiling
at
her
new
friend
always
so
dainty
and
still
so
delicate
in
spite
of
the
summer
rustication
thank
you
i
suppose
i
shall
never
be
very
strong
or
able
to
do
much
so
i
am
rather
like
a
fern
and
do
live
in
a
conservatory
all
winter
as
i
ca
go
out
a
great
deal
an
idle
thing
becky
and
emily
sighed
for
she
was
born
frail
and
even
her
tenderly
guarded
life
could
not
give
her
the
vigor
of
other
girls
but
the
sigh
changed
to
a
smile
as
she
added
if
i
am
like
the
fern
you
are
like
your
own
laurel
strong
rosy
and
able
to
grow
anywhere
i
want
to
carry
a
few
roots
home
and
see
if
they
wo
grow
in
my
garden
then
you
will
have
me
and
i
you
i
only
hope
your
plant
will
do
as
well
as
mine
does
it
wo
ever
so
many
folks
have
taken
roots
away
but
they
never
thrive
in
gardens
as
they
do
on
the
hills
where
they
belong
so
i
tell
to
leave
the
dear
bushes
alone
and
come
up
here
and
enjoy
in
their
own
place
you
might
keep
a
plant
of
it
in
your
and
it
would
blow
i
dare
say
but
it
would
never
be
half
so
lovely
as
my
acres
of
them
and
i
guess
it
would
only
make
you
sad
seeing
it
so
far
from
home
and
pale
and
pining
answered
becky
with
her
eyes
on
the
green
slopes
where
the
braved
the
wintry
snow
and
came
out
fresh
and
early
in
the
spring
then
i
let
it
alone
till
i
come
next
summer
but
do
you
take
any
of
the
fern
into
the
house
in
the
cold
weather
i
should
think
it
would
grow
in
your
sunny
windows
said
emily
pleased
by
the
fancy
that
it
resembled
herself
i
tried
it
but
it
needs
a
damp
place
and
our
cold
nights
kill
it
no
it
wo
grow
in
our
old
house
but
i
cover
it
with
leaves
and
the
little
green
sprouts
come
up
as
hearty
as
can
be
out
here
the
shade
the
spring
the
shelter
of
the
rock
keep
it
alive
you
see
so
it
no
use
trying
to
move
both
sat
silent
for
a
few
minutes
as
their
hands
moved
briskly
and
they
thought
of
their
different
lots
an
inquisitive
ray
of
sunshine
peeped
in
at
them
touching
becky
hair
till
it
shone
like
red
gold
the
same
ray
dazzled
emily
eyes
she
put
up
her
hand
to
pull
her
lower
and
touched
the
little
curls
on
her
forehead
this
recalled
her
pet
grievance
and
made
her
say
impatiently
as
she
pushed
the
thick
short
locks
under
her
net
my
hair
is
such
a
plague
i
do
know
what
i
am
to
do
when
i
go
into
society
this
crop
is
so
unbecoming
and
i
match
my
hair
anywhere
it
is
such
a
peculiar
shade
of
it
a
pretty
color
and
i
think
the
curls
much
nicer
than
a
boughten
switch
said
becky
quite
unconscious
that
her
own
luxuriant
locks
were
of
the
true
titian
red
and
would
be
much
admired
by
artistic
eyes
i
do
i
shall
send
to
paris
to
match
it
and
then
wear
a
braid
round
my
head
as
you
do
sometimes
i
suppose
it
will
cost
a
fortune
but
i
wo
have
a
crop
a
friend
of
mine
got
a
lovely
golden
switch
for
fifty
my
patience
do
folks
pay
like
that
for
false
hair
asked
becky
amazed
yes
indeed
white
hair
costs
a
hundred
i
believe
if
it
is
long
why
you
could
get
ever
so
much
for
yours
if
you
ever
wanted
to
sell
it
i
take
part
of
it
for
in
a
little
while
mine
will
be
as
dark
and
i
like
to
wear
your
hair
do
believe
mother
would
let
me
she
is
very
proud
of
our
red
heads
if
i
ever
do
cut
it
you
shall
have
some
i
may
be
hard
up
and
glad
to
sell
it
perhaps
my
sakes
i
smell
the
cake
burning
and
off
flew
becky
to
forget
the
chat
in
her
work
emily
did
not
forget
it
and
hoped
becky
would
be
tempted
for
she
really
coveted
one
of
the
fine
braids
but
felt
shy
about
asking
the
poor
girl
for
even
a
part
of
her
one
beauty
so
july
and
august
passed
pleasantly
and
profitably
to
both
girls
and
in
september
they
were
to
part
no
more
was
said
about
poetry
and
emily
soon
became
so
interested
in
the
busy
practical
life
about
her
that
her
own
dreams
were
quite
forgotten
and
she
learned
to
enjoy
the
sweet
prose
of
daily
labor
one
breezy
afternoon
as
she
and
her
mother
sat
resting
from
a
stroll
on
the
bank
among
the
and
asters
they
saw
becky
coming
up
the
long
hill
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
she
walked
slowly
as
if
lost
in
thought
yet
never
missed
pushing
aside
with
a
decided
gesture
of
her
foot
every
stone
that
lay
in
her
way
there
were
many
in
that
rocky
path
but
becky
left
it
smoother
as
she
climbed
and
paused
now
and
then
to
send
some
especially
sharp
or
large
one
spinning
into
the
grassy
ditch
beside
the
road
is
she
a
curious
girl
mamma
so
tired
after
her
long
walk
to
town
yet
so
anxious
not
to
leave
a
stone
in
the
way
said
emily
as
they
watched
her
slow
approach
a
very
interesting
one
to
me
dear
because
under
that
humble
exterior
lies
a
fine
strong
character
it
is
like
becky
to
clear
her
way
even
up
a
dusty
hill
where
the
first
rain
will
wash
out
many
more
stones
let
us
ask
her
why
she
does
it
i
observed
the
habit
before
and
always
meant
to
ask
replied
spenser
here
we
are
come
and
rest
a
minute
becky
and
tell
us
if
you
mend
roads
as
well
as
ever
so
many
other
things
called
emily
beckoning
with
a
smile
as
the
girl
looked
up
and
saw
them
oh
it
a
trick
of
mine
i
caught
it
of
father
when
i
was
a
little
thing
and
do
it
without
knowing
it
half
the
time
said
becky
sinking
down
upon
a
mossy
rock
as
if
rest
were
welcome
why
did
he
do
it
asked
emily
who
knew
that
her
friend
loved
to
talk
of
her
father
well
it
a
family
failing
i
guess
for
his
father
did
the
same
only
he
began
with
his
farm
and
let
the
roads
alone
the
land
used
to
be
pretty
much
all
rocks
up
here
you
know
and
farmers
had
to
clear
the
ground
if
they
wanted
crops
it
was
a
hard
fight
and
took
a
sight
of
time
and
patience
to
grub
out
roots
and
blast
rocks
and
pick
up
stones
that
seemed
to
grow
faster
than
anything
else
but
they
kept
on
and
now
see
as
she
spoke
becky
pointed
proudly
to
the
wide
smooth
fields
lying
before
them
newly
shorn
of
grass
or
grain
waving
with
corn
or
rich
in
garden
crops
ripening
for
winter
stores
here
and
there
were
rocky
strips
unreclaimed
as
if
to
show
what
had
been
done
and
massive
stone
walls
surrounded
pasture
field
and
garden
a
good
lesson
in
patience
and
perseverance
my
dear
and
does
great
honor
to
the
men
who
made
the
wilderness
blossom
like
the
rose
said
spenser
then
you
ca
wonder
that
they
loved
it
and
we
want
to
keep
it
i
guess
it
would
break
mother
heart
to
sell
this
place
and
we
are
all
working
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
then
we
be
just
the
happiest
family
in
new
hampshire
said
becky
fondly
surveying
the
old
the
rocky
hill
and
the
precious
fields
won
from
the
forest
you
never
need
fear
to
lose
it
we
will
see
to
that
if
you
will
let
us
began
spenser
who
was
both
a
rich
and
a
generous
woman
oh
thank
you
but
we
wo
need
help
i
guess
and
if
we
should
taylor
made
us
promise
to
come
to
her
cried
becky
she
found
us
just
in
our
hardest
time
and
wanted
to
fix
things
then
but
we
are
proud
in
our
way
and
mother
said
she
rather
work
it
off
if
she
could
then
what
did
that
dear
lady
do
but
talk
to
the
folks
round
here
and
show
how
a
branch
railroad
down
to
peeksville
would
increase
the
value
of
the
land
and
how
good
this
valley
would
be
for
strawberries
and
asparagus
and
garden
truck
if
we
could
only
get
it
to
market
some
of
the
rich
men
took
up
the
plan
and
we
hope
it
will
be
done
this
fall
it
will
be
the
making
of
us
for
our
land
is
for
small
crops
and
the
children
can
help
at
that
and
with
a
deepot
close
by
it
would
be
such
easy
work
that
what
i
call
helping
folks
to
help
themselves
wo
it
be
grand
becky
looked
so
enthusiastic
that
emily
could
not
remain
uninterested
though
did
not
sound
very
romantic
i
hope
it
will
come
and
next
year
we
shall
see
you
all
hard
at
it
what
a
good
woman
taylor
is
ai
she
and
the
sad
part
of
it
is
she
ca
do
and
enjoy
all
she
wants
to
because
her
health
is
so
poor
she
was
a
country
girl
you
know
and
went
to
work
in
the
city
as
waiter
in
a
a
rich
man
fell
in
love
with
her
and
married
her
and
she
took
care
of
him
for
years
and
he
left
her
all
his
money
she
was
quite
broken
down
but
she
wanted
to
make
his
name
loved
and
honored
after
his
death
as
he
had
done
any
good
while
he
lived
so
she
gives
away
heaps
and
is
never
tired
of
helping
poor
folks
and
doing
all
sorts
of
grand
things
to
make
the
world
better
i
call
that
splendid
so
do
i
yet
it
is
only
what
you
are
doing
in
a
small
way
becky
said
spenser
as
the
girl
paused
out
of
breath
mrs
taylor
clears
the
stones
out
of
people
paths
making
their
road
easier
to
climb
than
hers
has
been
and
leaving
behind
her
fruitful
fields
for
others
to
reap
this
is
a
better
work
than
making
verses
for
it
is
the
real
poetry
of
life
and
brings
to
those
who
give
themselves
to
it
no
matter
in
what
humble
ways
something
sweeter
than
fame
and
more
enduring
than
so
it
does
i
see
that
now
and
know
why
we
love
father
as
we
do
and
want
to
keep
what
he
worked
so
hard
to
give
us
he
used
to
say
every
stone
cleared
away
was
just
so
much
help
to
the
boys
and
he
used
to
tell
me
his
plans
as
i
trotted
after
him
round
the
farm
helping
all
i
could
being
the
oldest
and
like
him
he
becky
paused
with
full
eyes
for
not
even
to
these
good
friends
could
she
ever
tell
the
shifts
and
struggles
in
which
she
had
bravely
borne
her
part
during
the
long
hard
years
that
had
wrested
the
little
homestead
from
the
hills
the
musical
chime
of
a
distant
clock
reminded
her
that
supper
time
was
near
and
she
sprang
up
as
if
much
refreshed
by
this
pleasant
rest
by
the
as
she
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
a
little
roll
of
pale
blue
ribbon
fell
from
her
pocket
and
emily
caught
it
up
exclaiming
mischievously
are
you
going
to
make
yourself
fine
next
sunday
when
moses
pennel
calls
becky
the
girl
laughed
and
blushed
as
she
said
carefully
folding
up
the
ribbon
i
going
to
do
something
with
it
that
i
like
a
sight
better
than
that
poor
moses
wo
come
any
more
i
guess
i
not
going
to
leave
mother
till
the
girls
can
take
my
place
and
only
then
to
teach
if
i
can
get
a
good
school
somewhere
we
shall
see
and
emily
nodded
wisely
we
shall
and
becky
nodded
decidedly
as
she
trudged
on
up
the
steep
hill
beside
spenser
while
emily
walked
slowly
behind
poking
every
stone
she
saw
into
the
grass
unmindful
of
the
detriment
to
her
delicate
shoes
being
absorbed
in
a
new
and
charming
idea
of
trying
to
follow
taylor
example
in
a
small
way
a
week
later
the
last
night
came
and
just
as
they
were
parting
for
bed
in
rushed
one
of
the
boys
with
the
exciting
news
that
the
railroad
surveyors
were
in
town
the
folks
talking
about
the
grand
enterprise
and
the
fortune
of
the
place
made
forever
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
the
old
the
boys
cheered
the
little
girls
danced
the
two
mothers
dropped
a
happy
tear
as
they
shook
each
other
hands
and
emily
embraced
becky
tenderly
exclaiming
there
you
dear
thing
is
a
great
stone
shoved
out
of
your
way
and
a
clear
road
to
fortune
at
last
for
i
shall
tell
all
my
friends
to
buy
your
butter
and
eggs
and
fruit
and
pigs
and
everything
you
send
to
market
on
that
blessed
a
keg
of
our
best
winter
butter
is
going
by
stage
express
anyway
and
when
our
apples
come
we
sha
need
a
railroad
to
get
to
you
my
darling
dear
answered
becky
holding
the
delicate
girl
in
her
arms
with
a
look
and
gesture
half
sisterly
half
motherly
wholly
fond
and
grateful
when
emily
got
to
her
room
she
found
that
butter
and
apples
were
not
all
the
humble
souvenirs
offered
in
return
for
many
comfortable
gifts
to
the
whole
family
on
the
table
in
a
pretty
cover
lay
several
of
best
poems
neatly
copied
as
emily
had
expressed
a
wish
to
keep
them
and
round
the
rustic
volume
like
a
ring
of
red
gold
lay
a
great
braid
of
becky
hair
tied
with
the
pale
blue
ribbon
she
had
walked
four
miles
to
buy
that
her
present
might
look
its
best
of
course
there
were
more
embraces
and
kisses
and
thanks
and
loving
words
before
emily
at
last
lulled
herself
to
sleep
planning
a
christmas
box
which
should
supply
every
wish
and
want
of
the
entire
family
if
she
could
find
them
out
next
morning
they
parted
but
these
were
not
mere
summer
friends
and
they
did
not
lose
sight
of
one
another
though
their
ways
lay
far
apart
emily
had
found
a
new
luxury
to
bring
more
pleasure
into
life
a
new
medicine
to
strengthen
soul
and
body
and
in
helping
others
she
helped
herself
wonderfully
becky
went
steadily
on
her
dutiful
way
till
the
homestead
was
free
the
lads
able
to
work
the
farm
alone
the
girls
old
enough
to
fill
her
place
and
the
good
mother
willing
to
rest
at
last
among
her
children
then
becky
gave
herself
to
teaching
a
noble
task
for
which
she
was
well
fitted
and
in
which
she
found
both
profit
and
pleasure
as
she
led
her
flock
along
the
paths
from
which
she
removed
the
for
their
feet
as
well
as
for
her
own
she
put
her
poetry
into
her
life
and
made
of
it
a
grand
sweet
song
in
which
beauty
and
duty
rhymed
so
well
that
the
country
girl
became
a
more
useful
beloved
and
honored
woman
than
if
she
had
tried
to
sing
for
fame
which
never
satisfies
so
each
symbolical
plant
stood
in
its
own
place
and
lived
its
appointed
life
the
delicate
fern
grew
in
the
conservatory
among
and
camelias
adding
grace
to
every
bouquet
of
which
it
formed
a
part
whether
it
faded
in
a
or
was
carefully
cherished
by
some
poor
invalid
a
frail
thing
yet
with
tenacious
roots
and
strong
stem
nourished
by
memories
of
the
rocky
nook
where
it
had
learned
its
lesson
so
well
the
clung
to
the
bleak
hillside
careless
of
wintry
wind
and
snow
as
its
sturdy
branches
spread
year
by
year
with
its
evergreen
leaves
for
christmas
cheer
its
rosy
flowers
for
its
fresh
beauty
free
to
all
as
it
clothed
the
wild
valley
with
a
charm
that
made
a
little
poem
of
the
lovely
spot
where
the
pines
whispered
woodbirds
sang
and
the
hidden
brook
told
the
sweet
message
it
brought
from
the
where
it
was
born
the
end
