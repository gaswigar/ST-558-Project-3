he
was
thinking
of
the
town
he
had
known
not
of
new
york
he
had
heard
of
that
from
old
old
men
when
he
himself
had
still
been
young
and
had
smiled
at
their
garrulity
he
was
thinking
of
a
new
york
the
mighty
throbbing
city
to
which
he
had
come
long
ago
as
a
lad
from
the
new
hampshire
mountains
a
place
of
turbulent
thoroughfares
of
shouting
drivers
hurrying
crowds
the
crack
of
whips
and
the
clatter
of
wheels
an
uproarious
thrilling
town
of
enterprise
adventure
youth
a
city
of
pulsing
energies
the
center
of
a
boundless
land
a
port
of
commerce
with
all
the
world
of
stately
ships
with
snowy
sails
a
fascinating
pleasure
town
with
throngs
of
eager
travellers
hurrying
from
the
ferry
boats
and
rolling
off
in
hansom
cabs
to
the
huge
hotels
on
madison
square
a
city
where
american
faces
were
still
to
be
seen
upon
all
its
streets
a
cleaner
and
a
kindlier
town
with
more
courtesy
in
its
life
less
of
the
vulgar
scramble
a
city
of
houses
separate
homes
of
quiet
streets
with
rustling
trees
with
people
on
the
doorsteps
upon
warm
summer
evenings
and
groups
of
youngsters
singing
as
they
came
trooping
by
in
the
dark
a
place
of
music
and
romance
at
the
old
opera
house
downtown
on
those
dazzling
evenings
when
as
a
boy
he
had
ushered
there
for
the
sake
of
hearing
the
music
how
the
rich
joy
of
being
alive
of
being
young
of
being
loved
had
shone
out
of
women
eyes
shimmering
satins
dainty
gloves
and
little
jewelled
slippers
shapely
arms
and
shoulders
vivacious
movements
nods
and
smiles
swift
glances
ripples
bursts
of
laughter
an
exciting
hum
of
voices
then
silence
sudden
darkness
and
music
and
the
curtain
the
great
wide
curtain
slowly
rising
but
all
that
had
passed
away
roger
gale
was
a
rugged
heavy
man
not
quite
sixty
years
of
age
his
broad
massive
features
were
already
deeply
furrowed
and
there
were
two
big
flecks
of
white
in
his
grayish
hair
he
lived
in
a
narrow
red
brick
house
down
on
the
lower
west
side
of
the
town
in
a
neighborhood
swiftly
changing
his
wife
was
dead
he
had
no
sons
but
three
grown
daughters
of
whom
the
oldest
edith
had
been
married
many
years
laura
and
deborah
lived
at
home
but
they
were
both
out
this
evening
it
was
friday
edith
evening
and
as
was
her
habit
she
had
come
from
her
apartment
uptown
to
dine
with
her
father
and
play
chess
in
the
living
room
a
cheerful
place
with
its
lamp
light
and
its
shadows
its
chairs
its
sofa
its
book
cases
its
low
marble
mantel
with
the
gilt
mirror
overhead
they
sat
at
a
small
oval
table
in
front
of
a
quiet
fire
of
coals
and
through
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
roger
watched
his
daughter
edith
had
four
children
and
was
soon
to
have
another
a
small
demure
woman
of
with
light
soft
hair
and
clear
blue
eyes
and
limbs
softly
rounded
the
contour
of
her
features
was
full
with
approaching
maternity
but
there
was
a
decided
firmness
in
the
lines
about
her
little
mouth
as
he
watched
her
now
her
father
eyes
deep
set
and
gray
and
with
signs
of
long
years
of
suffering
in
them
displayed
a
grave
whimsical
wistfulness
for
by
the
way
she
was
playing
the
game
he
saw
how
old
she
thought
him
her
play
was
slow
and
and
there
came
long
periods
when
she
did
not
make
a
move
then
she
would
recall
herself
and
look
up
with
a
little
affectionate
smile
that
showed
she
looked
upon
him
as
too
heavy
with
his
age
to
have
noticed
her
small
lapses
he
was
grimly
amused
at
her
attitude
for
he
did
not
feel
old
at
all
with
that
whimsical
hint
of
a
smile
which
had
grown
to
be
a
part
of
him
he
tried
various
moves
on
the
board
to
see
how
far
he
could
go
without
interrupting
her
reveries
he
checkmated
her
his
cigar
and
waited
until
she
should
notice
it
and
when
she
did
not
notice
gravely
he
moved
back
his
queen
and
let
the
game
continue
how
many
hundreds
of
games
he
thought
edith
must
have
played
with
him
in
the
long
years
when
his
spirit
was
dead
for
her
now
to
take
such
chances
nearly
every
friday
evening
for
nearly
sixteen
years
before
that
judith
his
wife
had
been
here
it
was
then
that
the
city
had
been
young
for
to
roger
it
had
always
seemed
as
though
he
were
just
beginning
life
into
its
joys
and
sorrows
too
he
had
groped
his
way
as
most
of
us
do
and
had
never
penetrated
deep
but
he
had
meant
to
later
on
when
in
his
busy
city
days
distractions
had
arisen
always
he
had
promised
himself
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
return
to
this
interest
or
passion
for
the
world
still
lay
before
him
with
its
enthralling
interests
its
beauties
and
its
pleasures
its
tasks
and
all
its
puzzles
intricate
and
baffling
all
some
day
to
be
explored
this
deep
zest
in
roger
gale
had
been
bred
in
his
boyhood
on
a
farm
up
in
the
new
hampshire
mountains
there
his
family
had
lived
for
many
generations
and
from
the
old
house
the
huge
shadowy
barn
and
the
crude
little
sawmill
down
the
road
from
animals
grown
people
and
still
more
from
other
boys
from
the
meadows
and
the
mountain
above
with
its
cliffs
and
caves
and
forests
of
pine
young
roger
had
discovered
even
in
those
early
years
that
life
was
fresh
abundant
new
with
countless
glad
beginnings
at
seventeen
he
had
come
to
new
york
there
had
followed
hard
struggles
in
lean
years
but
his
rugged
health
had
buoyed
him
up
and
there
had
been
genial
friendships
and
dreams
and
explorations
a
search
for
romance
the
strange
glory
of
love
a
few
furtive
ventures
that
left
him
dismayed
but
though
love
had
seemed
sordid
at
such
times
it
had
brought
him
crude
exultations
and
if
his
existence
had
grown
more
obscure
it
had
been
somber
only
in
patches
the
main
picture
dazzling
still
and
still
he
had
been
just
making
starts
he
had
ventured
into
the
business
world
clerking
now
at
this
now
at
that
and
always
looking
about
him
for
some
big
opportunity
it
had
come
and
he
had
seized
it
despite
the
warnings
of
his
friends
what
a
wild
adventure
it
had
been
a
bureau
of
news
clippings
a
business
new
and
unheard
of
but
he
had
been
sure
that
here
was
growth
he
had
worked
at
it
day
and
night
and
the
business
widening
fast
had
revealed
long
ramifications
which
went
winding
and
stretching
away
into
every
phase
of
american
life
and
this
life
was
like
a
forest
boundless
and
impenetrable
intertwining
how
much
could
ever
know
of
it
all
then
had
come
his
marriage
judith
family
had
lived
long
in
new
york
but
some
had
died
and
others
had
scattered
until
only
she
was
left
this
house
had
been
hers
but
she
had
been
poor
so
she
had
leased
it
to
some
friends
it
was
through
them
he
had
met
her
here
and
within
a
few
weeks
he
had
fallen
in
love
he
had
felt
profound
disgust
for
the
few
wild
oats
he
had
sown
and
in
his
swift
reaction
he
had
overworshipped
the
girl
her
beauty
and
her
purity
until
in
a
delicate
way
of
her
own
she
had
hinted
that
he
was
going
too
far
that
she
too
was
human
and
a
passionate
lover
of
living
in
spite
of
her
low
quiet
voice
and
her
demure
and
sober
eyes
and
what
beginnings
for
roger
now
what
a
piling
up
of
intimate
joys
surprises
shocks
of
happiness
there
had
come
disappointments
too
sudden
severe
little
checks
from
his
wife
which
had
brought
him
occasional
questionings
this
love
had
not
been
quite
he
had
dreamed
this
woman
not
so
ardent
he
had
glimpsed
couples
here
and
there
that
set
him
to
imagining
more
consuming
passions
here
again
he
had
not
explored
very
deep
but
he
had
dismissed
regrets
like
these
with
only
a
slight
reluctance
for
if
they
had
settled
down
a
bit
with
the
coming
of
their
children
their
love
had
grown
rich
in
sympathies
and
silent
understandings
in
humorous
enjoyment
of
their
funny
little
chattering
like
magpies
in
the
genial
old
house
and
they
had
looked
happily
far
ahead
what
a
woman
she
had
been
for
plans
it
had
not
been
all
smooth
sailing
there
had
come
reverses
in
business
and
at
home
one
baby
a
boy
had
died
but
on
they
had
gone
and
the
years
had
swept
by
until
he
had
reached
his
forties
absorbed
in
his
growing
business
and
in
his
thriving
family
it
had
seemed
to
roger
still
as
though
he
were
just
starting
out
but
one
day
quite
suddenly
the
house
had
become
a
strange
place
to
him
with
a
strange
remote
figure
in
it
his
wife
for
he
had
learned
that
she
must
die
there
had
followed
terrible
weeks
then
judith
had
faced
their
disaster
little
by
little
she
had
won
back
the
old
intimacy
with
her
husband
and
through
the
slow
but
inexorable
progress
of
her
ailment
again
they
had
come
together
in
long
talks
and
plans
for
their
children
at
this
same
chessboard
in
this
room
repeatedly
she
would
stop
the
game
and
smiling
she
would
look
into
the
future
at
one
such
time
she
had
said
to
him
i
wonder
if
it
wo
be
the
same
with
the
children
as
it
has
been
with
us
no
matter
how
long
each
one
of
them
lives
wo
their
lives
feel
to
them
unfinished
like
ours
only
just
beginning
i
wonder
how
far
they
will
go
and
then
their
children
will
grow
up
and
it
will
be
the
same
with
them
unfinished
lives
oh
dearie
what
children
all
of
us
are
he
had
put
his
arm
around
her
then
and
had
held
her
very
tight
and
feeling
the
violent
trembling
of
her
husband
fierce
revolt
slowly
bending
back
her
head
and
looking
up
into
his
eyes
she
had
continued
steadily
and
when
you
come
after
me
my
dear
oh
how
hungry
i
shall
be
for
all
you
will
tell
me
for
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
and
she
had
asked
him
to
promise
her
that
but
he
had
not
kept
his
promise
for
after
judith
dying
he
had
felt
himself
terribly
alone
with
eternity
around
him
his
wife
slipping
far
away
and
the
universe
had
grown
stark
and
hard
impersonal
relentless
cold
a
storm
of
doubts
had
attacked
his
faith
and
though
he
had
resisted
long
for
his
faith
in
god
had
been
rooted
deep
in
the
mountains
of
new
england
in
the
end
it
had
been
wrenched
away
and
with
it
he
had
lost
all
hope
that
either
for
judith
or
himself
was
there
any
existence
beyond
the
grave
so
death
had
come
to
roger
soul
he
had
been
deaf
and
blind
to
his
children
nights
by
the
thousand
spent
alone
like
a
gray
level
road
in
his
memory
now
was
the
story
of
his
family
when
had
his
spirit
begun
to
awaken
he
could
not
tell
it
had
been
so
slow
his
second
daughter
deborah
who
had
stayed
at
home
with
her
father
when
laura
had
gone
away
to
school
had
done
little
things
continually
to
rouse
his
interest
in
life
edith
winsome
babies
had
attracted
him
when
they
came
to
the
house
laura
had
returned
from
school
a
joyous
creature
tall
and
slender
with
snapping
black
eyes
and
had
soon
made
her
presence
felt
one
day
in
the
early
afternoon
as
he
entered
the
house
there
had
burst
on
his
ears
a
perfect
gale
of
laughter
and
peering
through
the
portières
he
had
seen
the
full
of
young
girls
a
crew
as
wild
as
laura
herself
hastily
he
had
retreated
upstairs
but
he
had
enjoyed
such
glimpses
he
had
liked
to
see
her
fresh
pretty
gowns
and
to
have
her
come
in
and
kiss
him
then
had
come
a
sharp
heavy
jolt
his
business
had
suffered
from
long
neglect
and
suddenly
for
two
anxious
weeks
he
had
found
himself
facing
bankruptcy
edith
husband
a
lawyer
had
come
to
his
aid
and
together
they
had
pulled
out
of
the
hole
but
he
had
been
forced
to
mortgage
the
house
and
this
had
brought
to
a
climax
all
the
feelings
of
guiltiness
which
had
so
long
been
stirring
within
him
over
his
failure
to
live
up
to
the
promise
he
had
made
his
wife
and
so
roger
had
looked
at
his
children
and
at
first
to
his
profound
surprise
he
had
had
it
forced
upon
him
that
these
were
three
grown
women
each
equipped
with
her
own
peculiar
feminine
traits
and
desires
the
swift
accumulations
of
lives
which
had
expanded
in
a
city
that
had
reared
to
the
skies
in
the
many
years
of
his
long
sleep
but
very
slowly
month
by
month
he
had
gained
a
second
impression
which
seemed
to
him
deeper
and
more
real
to
the
eye
they
were
grown
women
all
but
inwardly
they
were
children
still
each
groping
for
her
happiness
and
each
held
back
as
he
had
been
either
by
checks
within
herself
or
by
the
gay
distractions
of
the
absorbing
city
he
saw
each
of
his
daughters
parts
of
himself
and
he
remembered
what
judith
had
said
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
and
he
began
to
get
glimmerings
of
a
new
immortality
made
up
of
generations
an
endless
succession
of
other
lives
extending
into
the
future
some
of
all
this
he
remembered
now
in
scattered
fragments
here
and
there
then
from
somewhere
far
away
a
great
bell
began
booming
the
hour
and
it
roused
him
from
his
revery
he
had
often
heard
the
bell
of
late
a
calm
intruder
it
had
first
struck
in
upon
his
attention
something
over
two
years
ago
vaguely
he
had
wondered
about
it
soon
he
had
found
it
was
on
the
top
of
a
tower
a
little
to
the
north
one
of
the
highest
pinnacles
of
this
tumultuous
modern
town
but
the
bell
was
not
tumultuous
and
as
he
listened
it
seemed
to
say
there
is
still
time
but
you
have
not
long
edith
sitting
opposite
him
looked
up
at
the
sound
with
a
stir
of
relief
ten
it
was
time
to
go
home
i
wonder
what
keeping
bruce
she
said
bruce
was
still
in
his
office
downtown
as
a
rule
on
friday
evenings
he
came
with
his
wife
to
supper
here
but
this
week
he
had
some
new
business
on
hand
edith
was
vague
about
it
as
she
tried
to
explain
she
knitted
her
brows
and
said
that
bruce
was
working
too
hard
and
her
father
grunted
assent
bruce
ought
to
knock
off
every
summer
he
said
for
a
good
solid
month
or
better
two
ca
you
bring
him
up
to
the
mountains
this
year
he
referred
to
the
old
new
hampshire
home
which
he
had
kept
as
a
summer
place
but
edith
smiled
at
the
idea
yes
i
could
bring
him
she
replied
and
in
a
week
he
be
perfectly
crazy
to
get
back
to
his
office
again
she
compressed
her
lips
i
know
what
he
needs
and
we
do
it
some
day
in
spite
of
him
a
suburb
eh
her
father
said
and
his
face
took
on
a
look
of
dislike
they
had
often
talked
of
suburbs
yes
his
daughter
answered
i
picked
out
the
very
house
he
threw
at
her
a
glance
of
impatience
he
knew
what
had
started
her
on
this
line
edith
friend
madge
deering
was
living
out
in
morristown
all
very
well
he
reflected
but
her
case
was
not
at
all
the
same
he
had
known
madge
pretty
well
although
the
death
of
her
husband
had
left
her
a
widow
at
with
four
small
daughters
to
bring
up
she
had
gone
on
determinedly
naturally
smart
and
able
madge
was
always
running
to
town
keeping
up
with
all
her
friends
and
with
every
new
fad
and
movement
there
although
she
made
fun
of
most
of
them
twice
she
had
taken
her
girls
abroad
but
edith
was
quite
different
in
a
suburb
she
would
draw
into
her
house
and
never
grow
another
inch
and
bruce
poor
devil
would
commute
and
take
work
home
from
the
office
but
roger
could
tell
her
that
i
be
sorry
to
see
you
do
it
he
said
i
miss
you
up
in
the
mountains
oh
we
come
up
in
the
summer
she
answered
i
would
miss
the
mountains
for
worlds
then
they
talked
of
summer
plans
and
soon
again
edith
smooth
pretty
brows
were
wrinkling
absorbedly
it
was
hard
in
her
planning
not
to
be
sure
whether
her
new
baby
would
come
in
may
or
early
june
it
was
only
the
first
of
april
now
while
she
talked
her
father
watched
her
he
liked
her
quiet
fearlessness
in
facing
the
ordeal
ahead
into
the
bewildering
city
he
felt
her
searching
anxiously
to
find
good
things
for
her
small
brood
to
make
every
dollar
count
to
keep
their
little
bodies
strong
to
guard
their
hungry
little
souls
from
many
things
she
thought
were
bad
of
all
his
daughters
he
told
himself
she
was
the
one
most
like
his
wife
while
she
was
talking
bruce
came
in
of
medium
height
and
a
wiry
build
his
quick
kindly
smile
of
greeting
did
not
conceal
the
fine
tight
lines
about
his
mouth
and
between
his
eyes
his
small
trim
moustache
was
black
but
his
hair
already
showed
streaks
of
gray
although
he
was
not
quite
and
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
his
right
hand
twitched
perceptibly
bruce
cunningham
had
married
just
after
he
left
law
school
he
had
worked
in
a
law
office
which
took
receiverships
by
the
score
and
through
managing
bankrupt
concerns
by
slow
degrees
he
had
made
himself
a
financial
surgeon
he
had
set
up
an
office
of
his
own
and
was
doing
splendidly
but
he
worked
under
fearful
tension
bruce
had
to
deal
with
bankrupts
who
had
barely
closed
their
eyes
for
weeks
men
half
out
of
their
minds
from
the
strain
the
struggle
to
keep
up
their
heads
in
those
angry
waters
of
finance
which
roger
vaguely
pictured
as
a
giant
whirlpool
though
honest
enough
in
his
own
affairs
bruce
showed
a
genial
relish
for
all
the
tricks
of
the
savage
world
which
was
as
the
breath
to
his
nostrils
and
at
times
he
appeared
so
wise
and
keen
he
made
roger
feel
like
a
child
but
again
it
was
bruce
who
seemed
the
child
he
seemed
to
be
so
naïve
at
times
and
edith
had
him
so
under
her
thumb
roger
liked
to
hear
bruce
stories
of
business
when
edith
would
let
her
husband
talk
but
this
she
would
not
often
do
for
she
said
bruce
needed
rest
at
night
she
reproved
him
now
for
staying
so
late
she
wrung
from
him
the
fact
that
he
had
no
supper
well
bruce
she
exclaimed
impatiently
now
is
that
just
like
you
you
going
straight
home
that
where
you
going
to
be
fed
up
and
put
to
bed
her
husband
grumbled
and
while
she
made
ready
to
bundle
him
off
he
turned
to
his
what
do
you
think
my
latest
he
asked
and
he
gave
a
low
chuckle
which
roger
liked
last
week
i
was
a
brewer
i
an
engineer
he
said
can
you
beat
it
a
building
contractor
me
and
as
he
smoked
his
cigarette
in
laconic
phrases
he
explained
how
a
huge
steel
construction
concern
had
gone
to
the
wall
through
building
skyscrapers
on
spec
and
outstripping
even
the
growth
of
new
york
they
got
into
court
last
week
he
said
and
the
judge
handed
me
the
receivership
the
judge
and
i
have
been
chums
for
years
he
has
hay
fever
so
do
i
come
bruce
i
ready
said
his
wife
i
been
in
their
office
all
day
he
went
on
their
general
manager
was
stark
mad
he
had
been
out
of
the
office
since
last
sunday
night
he
said
you
had
to
ask
him
a
question
and
wait
while
he
looked
at
you
and
held
onto
his
chair
he
broke
down
and
blubbered
the
poor
damn
fool
be
in
matteawan
in
a
week
you
be
there
yourself
if
you
do
come
home
broke
in
edith
voice
impatiently
and
out
of
that
poor
devil
and
out
of
the
mess
his
books
are
in
been
learning
engineering
he
had
followed
his
wife
out
on
the
steps
he
turned
back
with
a
quick
appealing
smile
well
see
you
soon
my
boy
said
roger
good
luck
to
the
engineering
oh
father
dear
cried
edith
from
the
taxi
down
below
remember
supper
sunday
night
i
wo
forget
said
roger
he
watched
them
start
off
up
the
street
the
night
was
soft
refreshing
and
the
place
was
quiet
and
personal
the
house
was
one
of
a
dozen
others
some
of
red
brick
and
some
of
brown
stone
that
stood
in
an
uneven
row
on
a
street
but
a
few
rods
in
length
one
side
of
a
little
triangular
park
enclosed
by
a
low
iron
fence
inside
of
which
were
a
few
gnarled
trees
and
three
or
four
park
benches
on
one
of
these
benches
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
figure
of
an
old
woman
there
and
he
stood
a
moment
watching
her
some
memory
stirring
in
his
mind
occasionally
somebody
passed
otherwise
it
was
silent
here
but
even
in
the
silence
could
be
felt
the
throes
of
change
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
charged
with
drastic
things
impending
already
the
opposite
house
line
had
been
broken
near
the
center
by
a
high
apartment
building
and
another
still
higher
rose
like
a
cliff
just
back
of
the
house
in
which
roger
lived
still
others
and
many
factory
lofts
reared
shadowy
bulks
on
every
hand
from
the
top
of
one
an
enormous
sign
a
corset
pictured
forth
in
lights
flashed
out
at
regular
intervals
and
from
farther
off
high
up
in
the
misty
haze
of
the
night
could
be
seen
the
gleaming
pinnacle
where
hour
by
hour
that
great
bell
slowly
boomed
the
time
away
yes
here
the
old
was
passing
already
the
tiny
parklet
was
like
the
dark
bottom
of
a
pit
with
the
hard
sparkling
modern
town
towering
on
every
side
slowly
pressing
pressing
in
and
glaring
down
with
yellow
eyes
but
roger
noticed
none
of
these
things
he
watched
the
old
woman
on
the
bench
and
groped
for
the
memory
she
had
stirred
ah
now
at
last
he
had
it
an
april
night
long
long
ago
when
he
had
sat
where
she
was
now
while
here
in
the
house
his
wife
first
baby
edith
had
begun
her
life
slowly
he
turned
and
went
inside
chapter
ii
roger
hearing
was
extremely
acute
though
the
room
where
he
was
sitting
his
study
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
he
heard
deborah
key
at
the
street
door
and
he
heard
the
door
softly
open
and
close
are
you
there
dearie
her
voice
from
the
hallway
was
low
and
his
answer
yes
child
was
in
the
same
tone
as
though
she
were
with
him
in
the
room
this
keen
sense
of
hearing
had
long
been
a
peculiar
bond
between
them
to
her
father
deborah
voice
was
the
most
distinctive
part
of
her
for
often
as
he
listened
the
memory
came
of
her
voice
as
a
girl
unpleasant
hurried
and
stammering
but
she
had
overcome
all
that
no
grown
woman
she
had
declared
when
she
was
eighteen
has
any
excuse
for
a
voice
like
mine
that
was
eleven
years
ago
and
the
voice
she
had
acquired
since
with
its
sweet
magnetic
quality
its
clear
and
easy
articulation
was
to
him
an
expression
of
deborah
growth
as
she
took
off
her
coat
and
hat
in
the
hall
she
said
in
the
same
low
tone
as
before
edith
has
been
here
i
suppose
yes
i
so
sorry
i
missed
her
i
tried
to
get
home
early
but
it
has
been
a
busy
night
her
voice
sounded
tired
comfortably
so
and
she
looked
that
way
as
she
came
in
though
only
a
little
taller
than
edith
she
was
of
a
sturdier
build
and
more
decided
features
her
mouth
was
large
with
a
humorous
droop
and
her
face
rather
broad
with
high
cheekbones
as
she
put
her
soft
black
hair
up
over
her
high
forehead
her
father
noticed
her
birthmark
a
faint
curving
line
of
red
running
up
from
between
her
eyes
imperceptible
as
a
rule
it
showed
when
she
was
tired
in
the
big
school
in
the
tenements
where
she
had
taught
for
many
years
she
gave
herself
hard
without
stint
to
her
work
but
she
had
such
a
good
time
through
it
all
she
had
a
way
too
he
reflected
of
always
putting
things
in
their
place
as
now
she
came
in
and
kissed
him
and
sank
back
on
his
leather
lounge
with
a
tranquil
breath
of
relief
she
seemed
to
be
dropping
school
out
of
her
life
roger
picked
up
his
paper
and
continued
his
reading
presently
they
would
have
a
talk
but
first
he
knew
that
she
wanted
to
lie
quite
still
for
a
little
while
vaguely
he
pictured
her
work
that
night
her
packed
to
bursting
with
small
jews
and
italians
and
deborah
at
the
blackboard
with
a
long
pointer
in
her
hand
the
fact
that
for
the
last
two
years
she
had
been
the
principal
of
her
school
had
made
little
impression
upon
him
and
meanwhile
as
she
lay
back
with
eyes
closed
her
mind
still
taut
from
the
evening
called
up
no
simple
but
far
different
places
a
mass
meeting
in
carnegie
hall
where
she
had
just
been
speaking
some
schools
which
she
had
visited
out
in
indiana
a
block
of
tenements
far
downtown
and
the
private
office
of
the
mayor
for
her
school
had
long
curious
arms
these
days
was
bruce
here
too
this
evening
she
asked
her
father
presently
roger
finished
what
he
was
reading
then
looked
over
to
the
lounge
which
was
in
a
shadowy
corner
yes
he
came
in
late
and
he
went
on
to
tell
her
of
engineering
at
once
she
was
interested
rising
on
one
elbow
she
questioned
him
for
deborah
was
fond
of
bruce
has
he
bought
that
automobile
he
wanted
no
replied
her
father
edith
said
they
could
afford
it
why
not
this
time
it
the
dentist
bills
young
betsy
teeth
straightened
yet
and
as
soon
as
she
been
beautified
they
going
to
put
the
clamps
on
george
poor
georgie
deborah
murmured
at
the
look
of
pain
and
disapproval
on
her
father
heavy
face
she
smiled
quietly
to
herself
george
who
was
edith
oldest
and
the
worry
of
her
days
was
roger
favorite
grandson
has
he
been
bringing
home
any
more
sick
dogs
no
this
time
it
was
a
rat
a
white
one
roger
answered
a
glint
of
dry
relish
appeared
in
his
eyes
george
brought
it
home
the
other
night
he
had
on
a
pair
of
ragged
old
pants
what
on
earth
he
had
traded
his
own
breeches
for
the
rat
said
roger
placidly
no
oh
father
really
and
she
sank
back
laughing
on
the
lounge
his
school
report
said
roger
was
quite
as
bad
as
ever
of
course
it
was
said
deborah
and
she
spoke
so
sharply
that
her
father
glanced
at
her
in
surprise
she
was
up
again
on
one
elbow
and
there
was
an
eager
expression
on
her
bright
attractive
face
do
you
know
what
going
to
do
some
day
we
going
to
put
the
rat
in
the
school
deborah
said
impatiently
we
going
to
take
a
boy
like
george
and
study
him
till
we
think
we
know
just
what
interests
him
most
and
if
in
his
case
animals
we
have
a
regular
zoo
in
school
and
for
other
boys
we
have
other
things
they
really
want
to
know
about
and
we
keep
them
until
five
when
their
mothers
will
have
to
drag
them
away
her
father
looked
bewildered
but
arithmetic
my
dear
you
find
they
have
learned
their
arithmetic
without
knowing
it
deborah
answered
sounds
a
bit
wild
murmured
roger
again
to
his
mind
came
the
picture
of
hordes
of
little
italians
and
jews
my
dear
if
i
had
to
teach
i
do
think
i
add
a
zoo
he
said
and
with
a
breath
of
discomfort
he
turned
back
to
his
reading
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
question
her
to
show
an
interest
in
her
work
but
he
had
a
deep
aversion
for
those
millions
of
foreign
tenement
people
always
shoving
shoving
upward
through
the
filth
of
their
surroundings
they
had
already
spoiled
his
neighborhood
they
had
flowed
up
like
an
ocean
tide
and
so
he
read
his
paper
frowning
guiltily
down
at
the
page
he
glanced
up
in
a
little
while
and
saw
deborah
smiling
across
at
him
reading
his
dislike
of
such
talk
the
smile
which
he
sent
back
at
her
was
half
apologetic
half
an
appeal
for
mercy
and
deborah
seemed
to
understand
she
went
into
the
living
room
and
there
at
the
piano
she
was
soon
playing
softly
listening
from
his
study
again
the
feeling
came
to
him
of
her
fresh
and
abundant
vitality
he
mused
a
little
enviously
on
how
it
must
feel
to
be
strong
like
that
never
really
tired
and
while
her
father
thought
in
this
wise
deborah
at
the
piano
leaning
back
with
eyes
half
closed
could
feel
her
tortured
nerves
relax
could
feel
her
pulse
stop
throbbing
so
and
the
dull
aching
at
her
temples
little
by
little
pass
away
she
played
like
this
so
many
nights
soon
she
would
be
ready
for
sleep
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
roger
rose
heavily
from
his
chair
by
long
habit
he
went
about
the
house
trying
the
windows
and
turning
out
lights
last
he
came
to
the
front
door
there
were
double
outer
doors
with
a
ponderous
system
of
locks
and
bolts
and
a
heavy
chain
mechanically
he
fastened
them
all
and
putting
out
the
light
in
the
hall
in
the
darkness
he
went
up
the
stairs
he
could
so
easily
feel
his
way
he
put
his
hand
lightly
first
on
the
foot
of
the
banister
then
on
a
curve
in
it
halfway
up
again
on
the
sharper
curve
at
the
top
and
last
on
the
knob
of
his
bedroom
door
and
it
was
as
though
these
guiding
objects
came
out
to
meet
him
like
old
friends
in
his
bedroom
while
he
slowly
undressed
his
glance
was
caught
by
the
picture
upon
the
wall
opposite
his
bed
a
little
landscape
poster
done
in
restful
tones
of
blue
of
two
herdsmen
and
their
cattle
far
up
on
a
mountainside
in
the
hour
just
before
the
dawn
tiny
silhouettes
against
the
awakening
eastern
sky
so
immense
and
still
this
birth
of
the
day
the
picture
always
gave
him
the
feeling
of
life
everlasting
judith
his
wife
had
placed
it
there
from
his
bed
through
the
window
close
beside
him
he
looked
up
at
the
wall
of
the
new
apartment
building
with
tier
upon
tier
of
windows
from
which
murmurous
voices
dropped
out
of
the
dark
now
soft
now
suddenly
angry
loud
now
droning
sullen
bitter
hard
now
gay
with
little
screams
of
mirth
now
low
and
amorous
drowsy
sounds
tier
upon
tier
of
modern
homes
all
overhanging
roger
house
as
though
presently
to
crush
it
down
but
roger
was
not
thinking
of
that
he
was
thinking
of
his
children
of
edith
approaching
confinement
and
all
her
anxious
hunting
about
to
find
what
was
best
for
her
family
of
bruce
and
the
way
he
was
driving
himself
in
the
unnatural
world
downtown
where
men
were
at
each
other
throats
of
deborah
and
that
school
of
hers
in
the
heart
of
a
vast
foul
region
of
tenement
buildings
swarming
with
strange
dirty
little
urchins
and
last
he
thought
of
laura
his
youngest
daughter
wild
as
a
hawk
gadding
about
the
lord
knew
where
she
even
danced
in
restaurants
through
his
children
he
felt
flowing
into
his
house
the
seething
life
of
this
new
town
and
drowsily
he
told
himself
he
must
make
a
real
effort
and
make
it
soon
to
know
his
family
better
for
in
spite
of
the
storm
of
long
ago
which
had
swept
away
his
faith
in
god
the
feeling
had
come
to
him
of
late
that
somewhere
in
some
manner
he
was
to
meet
his
wife
again
he
rarely
tried
to
think
this
out
for
as
soon
as
he
did
it
became
a
mere
wish
a
hungry
longing
nothing
more
so
he
had
learned
to
let
it
lie
deep
down
inside
of
him
sometimes
he
vividly
saw
her
face
after
all
who
could
tell
and
she
would
want
to
hear
of
her
children
yes
he
must
know
them
better
some
day
soon
he
must
begin
suddenly
he
remembered
that
laura
had
not
yet
come
home
with
a
sigh
of
discomfort
he
got
out
of
bed
and
went
downstairs
the
gas
in
the
hallway
unfastened
the
locks
and
the
chain
at
the
door
he
came
back
and
was
soon
asleep
he
must
have
dozed
for
an
hour
or
two
he
was
roused
by
hearing
the
front
door
close
and
a
big
motor
thundering
and
then
like
a
flash
of
light
in
the
dark
came
laura
rippling
laughter
chapter
iii
on
the
next
evening
saturday
while
roger
ate
his
dinner
laura
came
to
sit
with
him
she
herself
was
dining
out
that
she
should
have
dressed
so
early
in
order
to
keep
him
company
had
caused
her
father
some
surprise
and
a
faint
suspicion
entered
his
mind
that
she
had
overdrawn
at
the
bank
as
she
had
the
last
time
she
sat
with
him
like
this
her
manner
certainly
was
a
bit
strange
but
roger
put
the
thought
aside
whatever
she
wanted
laura
was
worth
it
in
a
tingling
fashion
he
felt
what
a
glorious
time
she
was
having
what
a
gorgeous
town
she
knew
it
was
difficult
to
realize
she
was
his
own
daughter
this
dashing
stranger
sitting
here
playing
idly
with
a
knife
and
caressing
him
with
her
voice
and
her
eyes
the
blue
evening
gown
she
was
wearing
doubtless
not
yet
paid
for
made
her
figure
even
more
supple
and
lithe
set
off
her
splendid
bosom
her
slender
neck
her
creamy
skin
her
hair
worn
low
over
her
temples
was
brown
with
just
a
tinge
of
red
her
eyes
were
black
with
gleaming
lights
her
lips
were
warm
and
rich
alive
he
did
not
approve
of
her
lips
once
when
she
had
kissed
him
roger
had
started
slightly
back
for
his
daughter
lips
were
rouged
and
they
had
reminded
him
of
his
youth
he
had
asked
her
sister
to
speak
to
her
but
deborah
had
told
him
she
did
not
care
to
speak
to
people
in
that
way
especially
women
especially
sisters
she
had
said
with
a
quiet
smile
all
very
well
he
reflected
but
somebody
ought
to
take
laura
in
hand
she
had
been
his
favorite
as
a
child
his
pet
his
tiny
daughter
he
remembered
her
on
his
lap
like
a
kitten
how
she
had
liked
to
cuddle
there
and
she
had
liked
to
bite
his
hand
a
curious
habit
in
a
child
i
hurt
daddy
he
could
still
recollect
the
gay
little
laugh
with
which
she
said
that
looking
up
brightly
into
his
face
and
here
she
was
already
grown
and
like
a
light
in
the
sober
old
house
fascinating
while
she
disturbed
him
he
liked
to
hear
her
high
pitched
voice
gossiping
in
deborah
room
or
in
her
own
dainty
chamber
chatting
with
the
adoring
maid
who
was
dressing
her
to
go
out
he
loved
her
joyous
thrilling
laugh
and
he
would
have
missed
her
from
the
house
as
he
would
have
missed
fifth
avenue
if
it
had
been
dropped
from
the
city
for
the
picture
roger
had
formed
of
this
daughter
was
more
of
a
symbol
than
of
a
girl
a
symbol
of
the
ardent
town
spending
wasting
dancing
mad
it
was
laura
who
had
kept
him
living
right
up
to
his
income
where
are
you
dining
he
asked
with
the
raymonds
he
wondered
who
they
were
oh
sarah
she
added
to
the
maid
call
up
raymond
apartment
and
ask
what
time
is
dinner
are
you
going
to
dance
later
on
he
inquired
oh
i
guess
so
she
replied
on
the
astor
roof
i
think
they
said
her
father
went
on
with
his
dinner
these
hotel
dances
he
had
heard
ran
well
into
sunday
morning
how
judith
would
have
disapproved
he
hesitated
uneasily
i
do
especially
care
for
this
dancing
into
sunday
he
said
for
a
moment
he
did
not
look
up
from
his
plate
when
he
did
he
saw
laura
regarding
him
oh
do
you
mind
i
sorry
i
wo
after
this
she
answered
and
roger
colored
angrily
for
the
glint
of
amusement
in
laura
mischievous
black
eyes
revealed
quite
unmistakably
that
she
regarded
both
her
father
and
his
feeling
for
the
sabbath
as
very
dear
and
quaint
and
old
old
of
course
he
seemed
old
to
roger
thought
indignantly
for
what
was
laura
but
a
child
did
she
ever
think
of
anything
except
having
a
good
time
had
she
ever
stopped
to
think
out
her
own
morals
let
alone
anyone
else
was
she
any
judge
of
what
was
old
or
of
was
old
and
he
determined
then
and
there
to
show
her
he
was
in
his
prime
impatiently
he
strove
to
remember
the
names
of
her
friends
and
ask
her
about
them
to
show
a
keen
lively
interest
in
this
giddy
gaddy
life
she
led
and
when
that
was
rather
a
failure
he
tried
his
daughter
next
on
books
books
of
the
most
modern
kind
stoutly
he
lied
and
said
he
was
reading
a
certain
russian
novel
of
which
he
had
heard
deborah
speak
but
this
valiant
falsehood
made
no
impression
whatever
for
laura
had
never
heard
of
the
book
i
get
so
little
time
for
reading
she
murmured
and
meanwhile
she
was
thinking
as
soon
as
he
finishes
talking
poor
dear
i
break
the
news
then
roger
had
an
audacious
thought
he
would
take
her
to
a
play
by
george
mustering
his
courage
he
led
up
to
it
by
speaking
of
a
play
deborah
had
seen
a
modern
drama
all
centered
upon
the
right
of
a
woman
to
lead
her
own
life
and
as
he
outlined
the
story
he
saw
he
had
caught
his
daughter
attention
with
her
pretty
chin
resting
on
one
hand
watching
him
and
listening
she
appeared
much
older
and
she
seemed
suddenly
close
to
him
how
would
you
like
to
go
with
me
and
see
it
some
evening
he
inquired
see
what
my
love
she
asked
him
her
thoughts
plainly
far
away
and
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
that
play
i
just
been
speaking
of
why
daddy
i
love
to
she
exclaimed
when
he
asked
and
he
fixed
a
night
he
was
proud
of
himself
eagerly
he
began
to
talk
of
opening
nights
at
wallack
roger
and
judith
when
they
were
young
had
been
great
first
nighters
there
and
now
it
was
laura
who
drew
him
out
and
as
he
talked
on
she
seemed
to
him
to
be
smilingly
trying
to
picture
it
all
now
i
better
tell
him
she
thought
do
you
remember
harold
sloane
she
asked
a
little
strangely
no
replied
her
father
a
bit
annoyed
at
the
interruption
why
you
met
him
two
or
three
times
have
i
the
queer
note
in
her
voice
made
him
look
up
laura
had
risen
from
her
chair
i
want
you
to
know
him
very
soon
there
was
a
moment
silence
going
to
marry
him
dad
she
said
and
roger
looked
at
her
blankly
he
felt
his
limbs
beginning
to
tremble
i
been
waiting
to
tell
you
when
we
were
alone
she
added
in
an
awkward
tone
and
still
staring
up
at
her
he
felt
a
rush
of
tenderness
and
a
pang
of
deep
remorse
laura
in
love
and
settled
for
life
and
what
did
he
know
of
the
affair
what
had
he
ever
done
for
her
too
late
he
had
begun
too
late
and
this
rush
of
emotion
was
so
overpowering
that
while
he
still
looked
at
her
blindly
she
was
the
first
to
recover
her
poise
she
came
around
the
table
and
kissed
him
softly
on
the
cheek
and
now
more
than
ever
roger
felt
how
old
his
daughter
thought
him
who
is
he
he
asked
hoarsely
and
she
answered
smiling
a
perfectly
nice
young
man
named
sloane
do
laura
tell
me
what
does
he
do
he
in
a
broker
office
junior
member
of
the
firm
oh
you
worry
dear
he
can
even
afford
to
marry
they
heard
a
ring
at
the
front
door
there
he
is
now
i
think
she
said
will
you
see
him
would
you
mind
see
him
no
her
father
cried
but
just
to
shake
hands
she
insisted
you
need
talk
or
say
a
word
we
only
a
moment
anyway
and
she
went
swiftly
out
of
the
room
roger
rose
in
a
panic
and
strode
up
and
down
before
he
could
recover
himself
she
was
back
with
her
man
or
rather
her
boy
for
the
fellow
to
her
father
eyes
looked
ridiculously
young
straight
as
an
arrow
slender
his
dress
suit
irreproachable
the
chap
nevertheless
was
more
than
a
dandy
he
looked
hard
as
though
he
trained
and
his
smooth
and
ruddy
face
had
a
look
of
shrewd
so
much
of
him
roger
fathomed
in
the
indignant
cornered
glance
with
which
he
welcomed
him
into
the
room
why
good
evening
gale
glad
to
see
you
again
sir
young
sloane
nervously
held
out
his
hand
roger
took
it
and
muttered
something
for
several
moments
his
mind
in
a
whirl
he
heard
their
talk
and
laughter
and
his
own
voice
joining
in
laura
seemed
enjoying
herself
her
eyes
brimming
with
amusement
over
both
her
victims
but
at
last
she
had
compassion
kissed
her
father
gaily
and
took
her
suitor
out
of
the
room
soon
roger
heard
them
leave
the
house
he
went
into
his
study
savagely
bit
off
a
cigar
and
gripped
his
evening
paper
as
though
he
meant
to
choke
it
the
maid
came
in
with
coffee
coffee
no
he
snapped
at
her
a
few
moments
later
he
came
to
his
senses
and
found
himself
smoking
fast
and
hard
he
heartily
damned
this
fellow
sloane
for
breaking
into
the
family
and
asking
poor
laura
to
risk
her
whole
life
just
for
his
own
selfish
pleasure
his
whim
yes
whim
was
the
very
word
for
it
laura
attitude
too
did
she
look
at
it
seriously
not
at
all
quite
plainly
she
saw
her
career
as
one
long
highland
fling
and
dance
with
this
harry
boy
as
her
partner
who
had
he
danced
with
in
his
past
the
fellow
past
must
be
gone
into
and
at
once
without
delay
here
indeed
was
a
jolt
for
roger
gale
a
pretty
shabby
trick
of
fate
this
was
not
what
he
had
planned
this
was
a
little
way
life
had
of
jabbing
a
man
with
surprises
for
months
he
had
been
slowly
and
comfortably
feeling
his
way
into
the
lives
of
his
children
patiently
conscientiously
but
now
without
a
word
of
warning
in
popped
this
young
turning
the
whole
house
upside
down
another
young
person
to
be
known
another
life
to
be
dug
into
and
with
pick
and
shovel
too
the
job
was
far
from
pleasant
would
deborah
help
him
not
at
all
she
believed
in
letting
people
alone
a
devilish
easy
philosophy
still
he
wanted
to
tell
her
at
once
if
only
to
stir
her
up
a
bit
he
did
not
propose
to
bear
this
alone
but
deborah
was
out
why
must
she
always
be
out
he
asked
in
that
infernal
zoo
school
but
no
it
was
not
school
she
was
dining
out
in
some
café
with
a
tall
lank
doctor
friend
of
hers
probably
she
was
to
marry
him
i
have
that
news
for
breakfast
roger
smote
his
paper
savagely
why
could
laura
have
waited
a
little
restlessly
he
walked
the
room
then
he
went
into
the
hall
took
his
hat
and
a
heavy
stick
which
he
used
for
his
night
rambles
and
walked
off
through
the
neighborhood
it
was
the
first
saturday
evening
of
spring
and
on
those
quiet
downtown
streets
he
met
couples
strolling
by
a
tall
thin
lad
and
a
buxom
girl
went
into
a
cheap
apartment
building
laughing
gaily
to
themselves
and
roger
thought
of
laura
a
group
of
young
italians
passed
humming
trovatore
and
it
put
him
in
mind
of
the
time
when
he
had
ushered
at
the
opera
would
young
man
be
willing
to
usher
more
like
him
to
down
the
aisle
he
reached
washington
square
feeling
tired
but
even
more
restless
than
before
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
motor
and
on
the
lurching
ride
uptown
he
darkly
reflected
that
times
had
changed
he
thought
of
the
avenue
he
had
known
with
its
long
lines
of
hansom
cabs
its
dashing
broughams
and
coupés
with
jingling
harness
livened
footmen
everything
sprucely
how
the
horses
had
added
to
the
town
but
they
were
gone
and
in
their
place
were
these
great
cats
these
purring
motors
sliding
softly
by
the
roger
had
swift
glimpses
down
into
lighted
limousines
in
one
a
big
rich
looking
chap
with
a
beard
had
a
dressy
young
woman
in
his
arms
lord
how
he
was
hugging
her
laura
would
have
a
motor
like
that
kisses
like
that
a
life
like
that
she
was
the
kind
to
go
it
hard
ahead
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
a
dark
rolling
torrent
of
cars
lights
gleaming
by
the
thousand
a
hubbub
of
gay
voices
cries
and
little
shrieks
of
laughter
mingled
with
the
blare
of
horns
he
looked
at
huge
shop
windows
softly
lighted
with
displays
of
bedrooms
richly
furnished
of
gorgeous
apparel
silks
and
lacy
filmy
stuffs
and
to
roger
in
his
mood
of
anxious
premonition
these
bedroom
scenes
said
plainly
o
come
all
ye
faithful
wives
come
let
us
adore
him
and
deck
ourselves
to
please
his
eye
to
catch
his
eye
to
hold
his
eye
for
marriage
is
a
game
these
days
yes
laura
would
be
a
spender
a
spender
and
a
speeder
too
how
much
money
had
he
that
chap
and
damn
him
what
had
he
in
his
past
how
roger
hated
the
very
thought
of
poking
into
another
man
life
poking
where
nobody
wanted
him
he
felt
desperately
alone
they
were
dancing
he
recalled
not
at
a
party
in
somebody
home
but
in
some
flashy
public
place
where
girls
of
her
kind
and
fancy
women
gaily
mixed
together
how
mixed
the
whole
city
was
getting
he
thought
how
mad
and
strange
gone
out
of
its
mind
this
city
of
his
children
lives
crowding
in
upon
him
chapter
iv
he
breakfasted
with
deborah
late
on
sunday
morning
he
had
come
down
at
the
usual
hour
despite
his
long
tramp
of
the
previous
night
for
he
wanted
to
tell
her
the
news
and
talk
it
all
out
before
laura
came
down
because
deborah
he
had
a
doubt
with
her
woman
curiosity
had
probed
deep
into
laura
affairs
in
the
many
long
talks
they
had
had
in
her
room
he
had
often
heard
them
there
and
so
as
he
waited
and
waited
and
still
his
daughter
did
not
come
roger
grew
distinctly
annoyed
and
when
at
last
she
did
appear
his
greeting
was
perfunctory
what
kept
you
out
so
late
last
night
oh
i
was
having
a
very
good
time
said
deborah
contentedly
she
poured
herself
some
coffee
i
always
wanted
she
went
on
to
see
laura
really
puzzled
downright
flabbergasted
and
i
saw
her
just
like
that
last
night
roger
looked
up
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
you
and
laura
together
last
night
exactly
on
the
astor
roof
at
her
father
glare
of
astonishment
a
look
of
quiet
relish
came
over
her
mobile
features
her
wide
lips
twitched
a
little
well
why
not
she
asked
him
i
quite
a
dancer
down
at
school
and
last
night
with
allan
baird
we
were
dining
together
you
know
he
proposed
we
go
somewhere
and
dance
he
a
perfectly
awful
dancer
and
so
i
held
out
as
long
as
i
could
but
he
insisted
and
i
gave
in
though
i
much
prefer
the
theater
well
breathed
roger
softly
so
you
hoof
it
with
the
rest
his
expression
was
startled
and
intent
would
he
ever
get
to
know
these
girls
well
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
about
oh
no
i
do
she
answered
i
never
know
what
i
about
if
you
always
do
you
miss
so
much
you
get
into
a
solemn
habit
of
trying
nothing
till
you
sure
but
to
return
to
laura
as
we
came
gaily
down
the
room
we
ran
right
into
her
you
see
that
how
allan
dances
and
when
we
collided
i
smiled
at
her
sweetly
and
said
hello
dearie
you
here
too
and
deborah
sipped
her
coffee
i
have
never
believed
that
the
lower
jaw
of
a
girl
could
actually
drop
open
but
laura
did
with
a
good
strong
light
allan
told
me
he
could
have
examined
her
tonsils
for
her
rather
a
disgusting
thought
you
see
until
she
saw
me
there
poor
laura
had
me
so
thoroughly
placed
my
job
my
tastes
and
habits
everything
all
cut
and
dried
she
has
never
once
come
to
my
school
and
in
every
talk
we
ever
had
there
has
always
been
some
perfectly
good
and
absorbing
reason
why
we
should
talk
about
laura
alone
there
is
now
said
her
father
he
was
in
no
mood
for
tomfoolery
his
daughter
saw
it
and
smiled
a
little
what
is
it
she
inquired
and
then
he
let
her
have
it
laura
wants
to
get
married
he
snapped
deborah
caught
her
breath
at
that
and
an
eager
excited
expression
swept
over
her
attractive
face
she
had
leaned
forward
suddenly
father
no
which
one
she
asked
tell
me
is
it
harold
sloane
it
is
oh
dad
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
oh
dad
she
repeated
what
the
matter
with
sloane
he
demanded
oh
nothing
nothing
it
all
right
it
is
eh
how
do
you
know
it
is
his
anxious
eyes
were
still
upon
hers
and
he
saw
she
was
thinking
fast
and
hard
and
shutting
him
completely
out
and
it
irritated
him
what
do
you
know
of
this
fellow
sloane
oh
nothing
nothing
nothing
humph
then
why
do
you
sit
here
and
say
it
all
right
talk
like
a
fool
he
exclaimed
he
waited
but
she
said
no
more
and
roger
exasperation
increased
he
has
money
enough
apparently
and
they
spend
it
like
march
hares
deborah
looked
up
at
him
what
did
laura
tell
you
dear
not
very
much
i
only
her
father
she
had
a
dinner
and
dance
on
her
mind
but
deborah
pressed
her
questions
and
he
gave
her
brief
replies
well
what
shall
we
do
about
it
he
asked
nothing
until
we
know
something
more
roger
regarded
her
fiercely
why
do
you
go
up
and
talk
to
her
then
she
asleep
yet
never
mind
if
she
is
if
she
going
to
marry
a
chap
like
that
and
ruin
her
life
it
high
time
she
was
up
for
her
breakfast
while
he
scanned
his
sunday
paper
he
heard
deborah
in
the
pantry
she
emerged
with
a
breakfast
tray
and
he
saw
her
start
up
to
laura
room
she
was
there
for
over
an
hour
and
when
she
returned
to
his
study
he
saw
her
eyes
were
shining
how
women
eyes
will
shine
at
such
times
he
told
himself
in
annoyance
well
he
demanded
better
leave
her
alone
she
advised
harold
is
coming
some
night
soon
what
for
to
have
a
talk
with
you
her
father
smote
his
paper
what
did
she
tell
you
about
him
he
asked
not
much
more
than
she
told
you
his
parents
are
dead
but
he
has
a
rich
widowed
aunt
in
bridgeport
who
adores
him
they
mean
to
be
married
the
end
of
may
she
wants
a
church
wedding
bridesmaids
ushers
the
wedding
reception
here
of
course
oh
lord
breathed
roger
dismally
we
wo
bother
you
much
father
dear
you
bother
me
much
he
retorted
i
propose
to
be
bothered
bothered
a
lot
i
going
to
look
up
this
fellow
sloane
but
let
leave
him
alone
for
she
bent
over
her
father
compassionately
what
a
night
you
must
have
had
poor
dear
roger
looked
up
in
grim
reproach
you
like
all
this
he
grunted
you
a
grown
woman
a
teacher
too
i
wonder
if
i
do
she
said
i
guess
i
a
queer
person
dad
a
curious
family
mixture
of
laura
and
edith
and
mother
and
you
with
a
good
deal
of
myself
thrown
in
but
it
feels
rather
good
to
be
mixed
do
you
think
let
stay
mixed
as
long
as
we
can
and
keep
together
the
family
that
afternoon
to
distract
him
deborah
took
her
father
to
a
concert
in
carnegie
hall
she
had
often
urged
him
to
go
of
late
but
despite
his
liking
for
music
roger
had
refused
before
simply
because
it
was
a
change
but
why
balk
at
going
anywhere
now
when
laura
was
up
to
such
antics
at
home
do
you
mind
climbing
up
to
the
gallery
deborah
asked
as
they
entered
the
hall
not
at
all
he
curtly
answered
he
did
mind
it
very
much
then
we
go
to
the
very
top
she
said
it
a
long
climb
but
i
want
you
to
see
it
it
so
different
up
there
i
do
doubt
it
he
replied
and
as
they
made
the
slow
ascent
pettishly
he
wondered
why
deborah
must
always
be
so
eager
for
queer
places
galleries
zoo
schools
tenement
slums
why
not
take
a
two
dollar
seat
in
life
deborah
seated
him
far
down
in
the
front
of
the
great
gallery
over
at
the
extreme
right
and
from
here
they
could
look
back
and
up
at
a
huge
dim
arena
of
faces
now
watch
them
close
she
whispered
see
what
the
music
does
to
them
as
the
symphony
began
below
the
faces
all
grew
motionless
and
as
the
music
cast
its
spell
the
anxious
ruffled
feelings
which
had
been
with
roger
all
that
day
little
by
little
were
dispelled
and
soon
his
imagination
began
to
work
upon
this
scene
he
saw
many
familiar
american
types
he
felt
he
knew
what
they
had
been
doing
on
sundays
only
a
few
years
before
after
church
they
had
eaten
large
sunday
dinners
then
some
had
napped
and
some
had
walked
and
some
had
gone
to
sunday
school
at
night
they
had
had
cold
suppers
and
afterwards
some
had
gone
back
to
church
while
others
as
in
roger
house
in
the
days
when
judith
was
alive
had
gathered
around
the
piano
for
hymns
young
men
callers
friends
of
their
daughters
had
joined
in
the
family
singing
yes
some
of
these
people
had
been
like
that
to
them
a
few
short
years
ago
a
concert
on
the
sabbath
would
have
seemed
a
sacrilege
he
could
almost
hear
from
somewhere
the
echo
of
abide
with
me
but
over
this
memory
of
a
song
rose
now
the
surging
music
of
pathetique
and
the
yearnings
and
fierce
hungers
in
this
tumultuous
music
swept
all
the
hymns
from
roger
mind
once
more
he
watched
the
gallery
and
this
time
he
became
aware
that
more
than
half
were
foreigners
out
of
the
mass
from
every
side
individual
faces
emerged
swarthy
weird
and
staring
hungrily
into
space
and
to
roger
the
whole
shadowy
place
the
very
air
grew
pregnant
charged
with
all
these
inner
lives
bound
together
in
this
mood
this
mystery
that
had
swept
over
them
all
immense
and
formless
baffling
this
furious
demanding
and
this
blind
wistful
groping
which
he
himself
had
known
so
well
ever
since
his
wife
had
died
and
he
had
lost
his
faith
in
god
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
all
if
life
were
nothing
but
a
start
and
there
were
nothing
but
the
grave
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
he
glanced
around
at
deborah
was
so
certain
so
serene
what
do
i
know
of
her
he
asked
little
or
nothing
he
sadly
replied
and
he
tried
to
piece
together
from
things
she
had
told
him
her
life
as
it
had
passed
him
by
had
there
been
no
questionings
no
sharp
disillusionments
there
must
have
been
he
recalled
irritabilities
small
acts
and
exclamations
of
impatience
boredom
blues
and
as
he
watched
her
he
grew
sure
that
his
daughter
existence
had
been
like
his
own
despite
its
different
setting
its
other
aims
and
visions
it
had
been
a
mere
beginning
a
feeling
for
a
foothold
a
search
for
light
and
happiness
and
deborah
seemed
to
him
still
a
child
how
far
will
go
he
wondered
although
he
was
still
watching
her
even
after
the
music
had
ceased
she
did
not
notice
him
for
a
time
then
she
turned
to
him
slowly
with
a
smile
well
what
did
you
see
she
asked
i
was
looking
he
replied
why
dearie
she
retorted
where
that
imagination
of
yours
it
was
with
you
he
answered
tell
me
what
you
were
thinking
and
still
under
the
spell
of
the
music
deborah
said
to
her
father
i
was
thinking
of
hungry
people
millions
of
them
now
this
minute
not
only
here
but
in
so
many
places
concerts
movies
libraries
hungry
oh
for
everything
life
its
beauty
all
it
means
and
i
was
thinking
this
is
youth
no
matter
how
old
they
happen
to
be
and
that
to
feed
it
we
have
schools
i
was
thinking
how
little
we
done
as
yet
and
of
all
that
we
so
sure
to
do
in
the
many
many
years
ahead
do
you
see
what
i
mean
she
squeezed
his
hand
welcome
back
to
school
she
said
back
into
the
hungry
army
of
youth
again
the
music
had
begun
and
sitting
by
her
side
he
wondered
whether
it
was
because
she
knew
that
laura
affair
had
made
him
feel
old
that
deborah
had
brought
him
here
they
went
to
edith
for
supper
the
cunninghams
apartment
was
on
the
west
side
well
uptown
it
was
not
the
neighborhood
which
edith
would
have
chosen
for
nearly
all
the
nice
people
she
knew
lived
east
of
the
park
but
rents
were
somewhat
lower
here
and
there
was
at
least
an
abundance
of
fresh
air
for
her
family
edith
had
found
that
her
days
were
full
of
these
perplexing
decisions
it
was
all
very
simple
to
resolve
that
her
children
be
normal
wholesome
nice
but
then
she
looked
into
the
city
into
schools
and
kindergartens
clothes
and
friends
and
children
parties
books
and
plays
and
through
them
all
to
her
dismay
she
felt
conflicting
currents
clashes
between
old
and
new
she
felt
new
york
and
anxiously
she
asked
herself
what
is
what
is
normal
what
is
wholesome
what
is
nice
cautiously
she
made
her
way
testing
and
comparing
trying
small
experiments
often
sharply
she
would
draw
in
her
horns
she
had
struck
something
common
and
she
knew
all
this
was
nothing
compared
to
the
puzzles
that
lay
ahead
for
from
her
friend
madge
deering
whose
girls
were
well
along
in
their
she
heard
of
deeper
problems
the
girls
were
so
inquisitive
dauntlessly
madge
was
facing
each
month
the
most
disturbing
questions
thank
heaven
edith
had
only
one
daughter
sons
were
not
quite
so
baffling
so
she
had
groped
her
way
along
when
her
father
and
deborah
arrived
placidly
she
asked
them
what
they
had
been
doing
and
when
she
heard
that
they
had
been
at
a
concert
on
the
sabbath
though
this
was
far
from
and
something
she
would
not
have
done
herself
it
did
not
bother
her
half
so
much
as
the
fact
that
hannah
the
irish
nurse
had
slapped
little
tad
that
afternoon
she
had
never
known
hannah
to
do
it
before
could
it
be
that
the
girl
was
tired
or
sick
perhaps
she
needed
a
few
days
off
i
must
have
a
talk
with
her
edith
thought
as
soon
as
father
and
deborah
go
roger
always
liked
to
come
here
say
what
you
would
about
edith
habit
of
keeping
too
closely
to
her
home
the
children
to
whom
she
had
devoted
herself
were
a
fine
clean
happy
lot
here
were
new
lives
in
his
family
glorious
fresh
beginnings
he
sat
on
the
floor
with
her
three
boys
watching
the
patient
efforts
of
george
to
harness
his
perturbed
white
rat
to
tad
small
fire
engine
george
was
a
lank
sprawling
lad
of
fourteen
all
legs
and
arms
and
elbows
with
rumpled
hair
and
freckled
face
a
quick
bright
smile
and
nice
brown
eyes
frank
simple
understandable
eyes
all
but
one
of
edith
children
were
boys
and
boys
were
a
blessed
relief
to
a
man
who
had
three
daughters
and
while
roger
watched
them
with
a
gentle
glow
of
anticipation
he
waited
for
what
should
follow
when
as
had
been
already
arranged
deborah
should
break
to
her
sister
the
news
of
laura
engagement
and
he
was
not
disappointed
the
change
in
edith
was
something
tremendous
until
now
so
quietly
at
the
news
that
laura
was
to
be
married
instantly
she
was
all
alert
sitting
there
in
the
midst
of
her
children
and
facing
a
time
of
agony
only
a
few
weeks
ahead
which
would
add
one
more
to
her
family
edith
pretty
florid
face
grew
flushed
and
radiant
as
she
exclaimed
what
a
perfectly
wonderful
thing
for
laura
now
if
only
she
can
have
a
child
her
questions
followed
thick
and
fast
and
with
them
her
thoughts
of
what
should
be
done
bruce
must
look
up
this
suitor
at
once
bruce
demurred
stoutly
but
without
avail
she
eagerly
questioned
her
sister
as
to
plans
for
the
wedding
but
plainly
she
considered
that
deborah
was
no
woman
to
give
her
the
full
information
she
wanted
she
must
see
laura
herself
at
once
for
though
she
had
thoroughly
disapproved
of
the
gay
existence
of
her
youngest
sister
still
laura
was
now
to
be
married
and
this
made
all
the
difference
just
before
roger
and
deborah
left
edith
drew
her
father
aside
and
with
a
curious
concern
and
pity
in
her
voice
she
said
i
so
sorry
i
sha
be
able
to
help
you
with
the
wedding
dear
and
make
it
the
sweet
kind
that
mother
would
have
wanted
of
course
there
deborah
she
be
there
but
her
head
is
so
full
of
new
ideas
afraid
she
may
find
the
house
rather
a
burden
after
laura
has
gone
away
edith
gave
a
worried
little
sigh
i
be
so
glad
she
added
when
we
get
that
place
in
morristown
we
want
you
out
there
often
and
for
good
long
visits
too
you
may
even
find
you
care
to
try
staying
there
with
us
for
a
while
roger
scowled
and
thanked
her
she
had
given
him
a
shock
of
alarm
so
she
thinks
that
deborah
will
find
the
housekeeping
too
hard
he
reflected
anxiously
and
as
he
walked
home
with
his
daughter
he
kept
glancing
at
her
face
which
for
all
its
look
of
quiet
had
so
much
tensity
beneath
she
had
packed
her
life
so
full
of
school
what
if
she
wanted
to
give
up
their
home
she
try
of
course
she
try
her
best
but
find
it
too
much
of
an
added
strain
and
again
he
felt
that
sickening
dread
deborah
said
nothing
he
felt
as
though
they
had
drifted
apart
and
at
night
in
his
bed
as
roger
stared
up
at
the
beetling
cliff
of
apartment
windows
just
outside
drearily
he
asked
himself
how
it
would
feel
to
live
like
that
chapter
v
one
afternoon
a
few
days
later
roger
was
riding
in
the
park
he
rode
william
a
large
lazy
cob
who
as
he
advanced
in
age
had
so
subtly
and
insidiously
slackened
his
pace
from
a
trot
to
a
jog
that
roger
barely
noticed
how
slowly
he
was
riding
as
he
rode
along
he
liked
to
watch
the
broad
winding
bridle
path
with
its
bobbing
procession
of
riders
that
kept
appearing
before
him
under
the
tall
spreading
trees
though
he
knew
scarcely
anyone
by
name
he
was
a
familiar
figure
here
and
he
recognized
scores
of
faces
to
many
men
he
nodded
at
passing
and
to
not
a
few
alluring
young
dames
ardent
creatures
with
bright
eyes
who
gave
him
smiles
of
greeting
roger
gravely
raised
his
hat
one
was
the
silver
lady
in
a
broadway
musical
show
but
he
thought
she
was
one
of
the
newport
crowd
he
liked
to
make
shrewd
guesses
like
that
there
were
so
many
kinds
of
people
here
there
were
stout
anxious
ladies
riding
for
figures
and
lean
morose
gentlemen
riding
for
health
there
were
joyous
girls
chatting
and
laughing
merrily
there
were
some
gallant
foreigners
and
there
were
riding
masters
and
roger
could
not
tell
them
apart
there
were
mad
boys
from
the
squadron
who
rode
at
a
furious
canter
and
there
were
groups
of
children
eager
and
flushed
excited
and
gay
with
stolid
grooms
behind
them
the
path
in
several
places
ran
close
beside
the
main
road
of
the
park
and
with
the
coming
of
the
dusk
this
road
took
on
deep
purple
hues
and
glistened
with
reflections
from
countless
yellow
motor
eyes
and
from
the
polished
limousines
sumptuous
young
women
smiled
out
upon
the
riders
at
least
so
roger
saw
this
life
and
after
those
bleak
lonely
years
confronted
by
eternity
it
was
good
to
come
here
and
forget
to
feel
himself
for
the
moment
a
part
of
the
thoughtless
gaiety
the
ease
and
luxury
of
the
town
here
he
was
just
on
the
edge
of
it
all
often
as
a
couple
passed
he
would
wonder
what
they
were
doing
that
night
in
the
riding
school
where
he
kept
his
horse
it
was
a
lazy
pleasure
to
have
the
english
valet
there
pull
off
his
boots
and
breeches
though
if
anyone
had
told
him
so
roger
would
have
denied
it
with
indignation
and
surprise
for
was
he
not
an
american
it
had
been
a
wonderful
tonic
a
great
idea
of
laura
this
forcing
him
up
here
to
ride
in
one
of
her
affectionate
moods
just
after
a
sick
spell
he
had
been
through
his
gay
capricious
daughter
had
insisted
that
he
have
his
horse
brought
down
from
the
mountains
she
had
promised
to
ride
with
him
herself
and
she
had
done
so
for
a
week
since
then
he
had
often
met
her
here
with
one
of
her
many
smart
young
men
what
a
smile
of
greeting
would
flash
on
her
face
when
laura
happened
to
notice
him
he
was
thinking
of
laura
now
and
there
was
an
anxious
gleam
in
his
eyes
for
young
sloane
was
coming
to
dinner
what
was
he
going
to
say
to
the
fellow
bruce
had
learned
that
sloane
played
polo
owned
and
drove
a
racing
car
and
was
well
liked
in
his
several
clubs
but
what
about
women
and
his
past
edith
had
urged
her
father
to
go
through
the
lad
life
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
and
if
he
should
find
anything
there
to
kick
up
no
end
of
a
row
for
the
honor
of
the
family
all
of
which
was
nothing
but
words
reflected
roger
pettishly
it
all
came
to
this
that
he
had
a
most
ticklish
evening
ahead
on
the
path
as
a
rider
greeted
him
his
reply
was
a
dismal
frown
laura
suitor
arrived
at
six
in
his
study
roger
heard
the
bell
listened
a
moment
with
beating
heart
then
raised
himself
heavily
from
his
chair
and
went
into
the
hallway
ah
yes
it
you
he
exclaimed
with
a
nervous
cordiality
come
in
my
boy
come
right
in
here
let
me
help
you
with
your
coat
i
do
know
just
where
laura
is
ahem
he
violently
cleared
his
throat
suppose
while
we
waiting
we
have
a
smoke
he
kept
it
up
back
into
his
den
there
the
suitor
refused
a
cigar
and
carefully
lit
a
cigarette
roger
noticed
again
how
young
the
chap
was
and
marriage
seemed
so
ridiculous
all
this
feverish
trouble
was
for
something
so
unreal
well
sir
the
candidate
blurted
forth
i
guess
i
better
come
right
to
the
point
gale
i
want
to
marry
your
daughter
laura
yes
roger
cursed
himself
why
had
he
asked
laura
of
course
it
was
laura
would
this
cub
be
wanting
deborah
well
my
boy
he
said
thickly
i
i
wish
i
knew
you
better
so
do
i
sir
suppose
we
begin
the
youth
took
a
quick
pull
at
his
cigarette
he
waited
stirred
nervously
in
his
seat
you
have
some
questions
to
ask
i
suppose
yes
there
are
questions
roger
had
risen
mechanically
and
was
slowly
walking
the
room
he
threw
out
short
gruff
phrases
i
not
interested
in
your
past
i
do
care
about
digging
into
a
man
i
never
have
and
i
never
will
except
as
it
might
affect
my
daughter
that
the
main
question
i
suppose
can
you
make
her
happy
i
think
so
said
sloane
decidedly
roger
gave
him
a
glance
of
displeasure
that
a
large
order
young
man
he
rejoined
then
let
take
it
in
sections
the
youngster
replied
confound
his
boyish
assurance
to
begin
with
he
was
saying
i
rather
think
i
have
money
enough
we
better
go
into
that
had
we
yes
said
roger
indifferently
we
might
as
well
go
into
it
of
course
the
chap
had
money
enough
he
was
a
money
maker
you
could
hear
it
in
his
voice
you
could
see
it
in
his
jaw
in
his
small
aggressive
blonde
moustache
now
he
was
telling
briefly
of
his
rich
aunt
in
bridgeport
of
the
generous
start
she
had
given
him
his
work
downtown
his
income
thousand
this
year
he
said
we
can
live
on
that
all
right
i
guess
you
wo
starve
was
the
dry
response
roger
walked
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
turned
abruptly
on
young
sloane
look
here
young
man
i
do
want
to
dig
he
continued
very
huskily
but
i
know
little
or
nothing
of
what
may
be
behind
you
i
do
care
to
ask
you
about
it
now
unless
it
can
make
trouble
it
ca
make
trouble
at
this
answer
low
but
sharp
roger
wheeled
and
shot
a
glance
into
those
clear
and
twinkling
eyes
and
his
own
eyes
gleamed
with
pain
laura
had
been
such
a
little
thing
in
the
days
when
she
had
been
his
pet
the
days
when
he
had
known
her
well
what
could
he
do
about
it
this
was
only
the
usual
thing
but
he
felt
suddenly
sick
of
life
how
soon
do
you
want
to
get
married
he
demanded
harshly
next
month
if
we
can
where
are
you
going
abroad
said
sloane
roger
caught
at
this
topic
as
at
a
straw
soon
they
were
talking
of
the
trip
and
the
tension
slackened
rapidly
he
had
never
been
abroad
himself
but
had
always
dreamed
of
going
there
with
maps
and
books
of
travel
judith
and
he
had
planned
it
out
in
imagination
they
had
lived
in
london
and
paris
munich
and
rome
always
in
queer
old
lodgings
looking
on
quaint
crooked
streets
he
had
dreamed
of
long
delicious
rambles
glimpses
into
queer
old
shops
vast
silent
dark
cathedrals
for
laura
how
different
it
would
be
this
boy
of
hers
knew
europe
as
a
group
of
gorgeous
new
hotels
the
moment
laura
joined
them
her
father
eye
was
caught
and
held
by
the
ring
upon
her
finger
roger
knew
rings
they
were
his
hobby
and
this
huge
yellow
solitaire
in
its
new
and
brilliant
setting
at
once
awakened
his
dislike
it
just
fitted
the
life
they
were
to
lead
what
life
as
he
listened
to
his
daughter
he
kept
wondering
if
she
were
so
sure
had
she
felt
no
uneasiness
she
must
have
he
decided
for
all
her
gay
excitement
one
laura
in
that
smiling
face
another
laura
deep
inside
doubting
and
uncertain
reaching
for
her
happiness
now
elated
now
dismayed
exclaiming
now
at
last
i
starting
oh
what
an
ignorant
child
she
was
he
wanted
to
cry
out
to
her
you
be
just
starting
never
be
sure
you
never
be
happy
you
always
be
just
beginning
to
be
and
the
happier
you
are
the
more
you
will
feel
it
is
only
a
start
and
more
and
more
his
spirit
withdrew
from
these
two
heedless
children
later
on
when
deborah
came
he
barely
noticed
her
meeting
with
sloane
and
through
dinner
while
they
talked
of
plans
for
the
wedding
the
trip
abroad
still
roger
took
no
part
at
all
he
felt
dull
and
heavy
deborah
too
he
noticed
after
her
first
efforts
to
be
welcoming
and
friendly
had
gradually
grown
silent
he
saw
her
watching
laura
with
a
mingled
look
of
affection
and
of
whimsical
dismay
soon
after
dinner
she
left
them
and
roger
smoked
with
the
boy
for
a
while
and
learned
that
he
was
both
had
grown
uneasy
and
rather
dull
with
each
other
it
was
a
relief
when
again
laura
joined
them
dressed
to
go
out
she
and
her
lover
left
the
house
roger
sat
motionless
for
some
time
his
cigar
grew
cold
unheeded
one
of
the
sorrows
of
his
life
had
been
that
his
only
son
had
died
bruce
had
been
almost
like
a
son
but
this
young
man
of
laura
no
later
he
went
for
his
evening
walk
and
as
though
drawn
by
invisible
chains
he
strayed
far
down
into
the
ghetto
soon
he
was
elbowing
his
way
through
a
maze
of
uproarious
tenement
streets
as
one
who
had
been
there
many
times
but
he
noticed
little
around
him
he
went
on
as
he
had
always
gone
seeing
and
hearing
this
seething
life
only
as
a
background
to
his
own
adventure
he
reached
his
destination
pushing
his
way
through
a
swarm
of
urchins
playing
in
front
of
a
pawnshop
he
entered
and
was
a
long
time
inside
and
when
he
came
out
again
at
last
the
whole
expression
of
his
face
had
undergone
a
striking
change
as
one
who
had
found
the
solace
he
needed
for
the
moment
his
pace
unconsciously
quickened
and
he
looked
about
him
with
brighter
eyes
around
the
corner
from
his
home
he
went
into
a
small
jewelry
shop
a
remnant
of
the
town
of
the
past
there
were
no
customers
in
the
place
and
the
old
galician
jeweler
sat
at
the
back
playing
solitaire
at
sight
of
roger
he
arose
and
presently
in
a
small
back
room
beneath
the
glare
of
a
powerful
lamp
the
two
were
studying
the
ring
which
roger
had
found
in
the
ghetto
that
night
it
was
plain
just
a
thin
worn
band
of
gold
with
an
emerald
by
no
means
large
but
the
setting
was
old
and
curious
and
personal
distinctive
somebody
over
in
europe
had
worked
on
it
long
and
lovingly
now
as
the
galician
gently
rubbed
and
polished
and
turned
the
ring
this
way
and
that
the
light
revealed
crude
tiny
figures
a
man
and
a
woman
under
a
tree
and
was
that
a
vine
or
a
serpent
they
studied
it
long
and
absorbedly
at
home
up
in
his
bedroom
roger
opened
a
safe
which
stood
in
one
corner
took
out
a
large
shallow
tray
and
sat
down
with
it
by
his
lamp
a
strange
array
of
rings
was
there
small
and
delicate
huge
bizarre
great
signet
rings
and
poison
rings
love
tokens
charms
and
amulets
rings
which
had
been
worn
by
wives
by
mistresses
by
favorite
slaves
and
by
young
girls
in
convents
rings
with
the
madonna
and
rings
with
many
other
saints
graven
on
large
heavy
stones
rings
french
and
russian
polish
italian
spanish
syrian
some
were
many
centuries
old
in
nine
shallow
metal
trays
they
filled
the
safe
in
roger
room
although
its
money
value
was
small
the
gale
collection
was
well
known
to
a
scattered
public
of
connoisseurs
and
roger
took
pride
in
showing
it
but
what
had
always
appealed
to
him
most
was
the
romance
the
mystery
stored
up
in
these
old
talismans
that
had
lived
so
many
ages
travelled
through
so
many
lands
decked
so
many
fingers
roger
had
found
every
one
of
them
in
the
pawnshops
of
new
york
what
new
recruits
to
america
had
brought
them
here
and
pawned
them
from
what
old
cities
had
they
come
what
passions
of
love
and
jealousy
of
hatred
faith
devotion
were
in
this
glittering
array
roger
own
love
affair
had
been
deep
but
quiet
and
even
and
happy
all
the
wild
adventures
the
in
his
sex
life
were
gathered
in
these
dusky
trays
with
their
richly
colored
glints
of
light
of
his
daughters
laura
had
been
the
one
most
interested
in
his
rings
and
so
he
thought
of
laura
now
as
he
placed
in
the
tray
the
new
ring
he
had
bought
the
one
he
would
have
liked
for
her
but
a
vague
uneasiness
filled
his
mind
for
he
knew
she
had
the
same
craving
as
he
for
what
gleamed
out
of
these
somber
trays
the
old
galician
jeweler
had
long
been
quite
a
friend
of
hers
she
had
often
dropped
in
at
his
shop
to
ask
him
curious
questions
about
his
women
patrons
and
it
was
just
this
side
of
him
that
roger
did
not
care
for
so
many
of
those
women
were
from
a
dubious
glittering
world
and
the
old
galician
took
a
weird
vicarious
joy
in
many
of
the
gay
careers
into
which
he
sent
his
beloved
rings
his
brooches
earrings
necklaces
his
clasps
and
diamond
garters
and
laura
loved
to
make
him
talk
yes
she
was
her
father
child
a
part
of
himself
he
too
had
had
his
yearnings
his
burning
curiosities
his
youthful
ventures
into
the
town
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
with
her
inheritance
what
would
she
do
would
she
stop
halfway
as
he
had
done
or
would
she
throw
all
caution
aside
and
let
the
flames
within
her
rise
he
heard
a
step
in
the
doorway
and
deborah
stood
there
smiling
a
new
one
she
inquired
he
nodded
and
she
bent
over
the
tray
poor
father
deborah
murmured
i
saw
you
eyeing
laura
engagement
ring
at
dinner
it
was
like
this
one
was
it
he
scowled
i
do
like
what
i
see
ahead
of
her
nor
do
you
he
said
be
honest
she
looked
at
him
perplexedly
we
ca
stop
it
can
we
and
even
if
we
could
she
said
i
not
quite
sure
i
want
to
it
her
love
affair
not
yours
or
mine
grown
out
of
a
life
she
made
for
herself
curious
eager
thrilled
by
it
all
and
in
the
center
of
her
soul
the
deep
glad
growing
certainty
going
to
be
a
beautiful
woman
i
myself
i
laura
gale
oh
you
do
know
nor
do
i
and
so
she
felt
her
way
along
eagerly
hungrily
making
mistakes
and
you
and
i
left
her
to
do
it
alone
i
afraid
we
both
rather
neglected
her
dad
deborah
ended
sadly
and
all
we
can
do
now
i
think
is
to
give
her
the
kind
of
wedding
she
wants
roger
started
to
speak
but
hesitated
what
is
it
she
inquired
queer
he
answered
gruffly
how
a
man
can
neglect
his
children
as
i
have
done
as
i
do
still
when
the
one
thing
he
wants
most
in
life
is
to
see
each
one
of
happy
chapter
vi
roger
soon
grew
accustomed
to
seeing
young
sloane
about
the
house
they
could
talk
together
more
easily
and
he
began
to
call
him
harold
harold
asked
him
with
laura
to
lunch
at
the
ritz
to
meet
the
aunt
from
bridgeport
a
lady
excessively
stout
and
profound
but
that
ended
the
formalities
it
had
all
been
so
much
easier
than
roger
had
expected
so
in
its
calm
sober
fashion
the
old
house
took
into
its
life
this
new
member
these
new
plans
and
the
old
seemed
stronger
for
the
new
for
laura
and
edith
and
deborah
drew
together
closer
than
they
had
been
in
many
years
but
only
because
they
felt
themselves
on
the
eve
of
a
still
deeper
and
more
lasting
separation
as
the
family
of
roger
gale
divided
and
went
different
ways
at
times
he
noticed
it
sadly
laura
who
had
scarcely
ever
been
home
for
dinner
now
spent
many
evenings
here
she
needed
her
home
for
her
wedding
he
thought
each
daughter
needed
it
now
and
then
but
as
the
years
wore
slowly
on
the
seasons
when
they
needed
it
grew
steadily
wider
and
wider
apart
early
in
may
when
roger
came
home
from
his
office
one
night
he
found
edith
children
in
the
house
from
the
hallway
he
could
hear
their
gay
excited
voices
and
going
into
the
dining
room
he
found
them
at
their
supper
deborah
was
with
them
and
at
once
her
father
noticed
how
much
younger
she
appeared
as
she
always
did
with
these
children
who
all
idolized
her
so
she
rose
and
followed
him
into
the
hall
and
her
quiet
voice
had
a
note
of
compassion
edith
baby
is
coming
she
said
good
lord
is
anything
wrong
he
asked
no
no
it
all
right
but
i
thought
the
child
was
due
for
three
weeks
i
know
and
poor
edith
is
fearfully
worried
it
has
upset
all
her
plans
i
go
up
and
see
her
if
i
were
you
your
supper
is
ready
and
if
you
like
you
can
have
it
with
the
children
there
followed
a
happy
boisterous
meal
with
much
expectant
chatter
about
the
long
summer
so
soon
to
begin
at
the
farm
up
in
the
mountains
george
whose
hair
was
down
over
his
eyes
rumpled
it
back
absorbedly
as
he
told
of
a
letter
he
had
received
from
his
friend
dave
royce
roger
farmer
with
whom
george
corresponded
one
of
the
cows
was
to
have
a
calf
and
george
was
anxious
to
get
there
in
time
i
never
seen
a
real
new
calf
new
absolutely
he
explained
and
i
want
a
look
at
this
one
the
very
minute
that
he
born
gee
i
hope
we
can
get
there
in
time
gee
so
do
i
cried
bobby
aged
nine
and
then
tad
the
chubby
who
had
been
intently
watching
his
brothers
slowly
took
the
spoon
from
his
mouth
and
in
his
grave
sweet
baby
voice
said
very
softly
gee
at
her
end
of
the
table
elizabeth
blonde
and
short
and
rather
plump
frowned
and
colored
slightly
for
she
was
eleven
and
she
knew
there
was
something
dark
and
shameful
about
the
way
calves
appear
in
barns
and
so
with
a
quick
conscious
cough
she
sweetly
interrupted
oh
aunt
deborah
wo
you
please
tell
us
about
about
about
about
jeered
the
ironical
george
about
what
you
little
ninny
poor
elizabeth
blushed
desperately
she
was
neither
quick
nor
resourceful
now
george
said
his
aunt
warningly
was
i
talking
the
boy
rejoined
and
did
betsy
butt
right
in
without
even
a
thing
to
butt
in
about
about
about
he
jeered
again
about
paris
cried
his
sister
successful
at
last
in
her
frantic
search
for
a
proper
topic
of
conversation
aunt
deborah
trip
to
paris
how
many
times
has
she
told
it
already
her
brother
replied
with
withering
scorn
and
anyhow
i
was
talking
of
cows
very
well
said
his
aunt
we
talk
about
cows
some
cows
i
saw
on
a
lovely
old
farm
in
a
little
village
over
in
france
there
cried
his
young
sister
did
she
ever
tell
of
part
of
her
trip
and
she
made
a
little
face
at
her
brother
i
do
care
he
answered
doggedly
she
has
told
about
paris
lots
of
times
and
that
was
what
wanted
yes
you
did
you
said
paris
did
she
bob
you
bet
she
did
young
bob
agreed
now
children
children
what
does
it
matter
all
right
go
ahead
with
your
barn
in
france
said
george
with
patient
tolerance
did
they
have
any
holsteins
soon
the
questions
were
popping
from
every
side
while
little
tad
beamed
from
one
to
the
other
to
tad
it
was
all
so
wonderful
to
be
having
supper
away
from
home
to
be
here
to
go
to
bed
upstairs
to
take
part
perhaps
in
a
pillow
fight
and
glancing
at
the
glowing
face
and
the
parted
lips
of
his
small
grandson
roger
felt
a
current
of
warm
new
life
pour
into
his
soul
early
in
the
evening
he
went
up
to
edith
apartment
he
found
his
daughter
in
her
room
looking
flushed
and
very
tense
he
took
her
arm
and
they
walked
for
a
time
a
trained
nurse
was
soaping
the
windows
roger
asked
the
reason
for
this
and
was
told
that
in
case
the
baby
did
not
come
till
morning
the
doctor
wanted
to
pull
up
the
shades
in
order
to
work
by
daylight
and
neighbors
in
new
york
are
such
cats
you
no
idea
said
edith
she
looked
out
at
the
numberless
windows
crowding
close
about
her
home
and
she
fairly
bristled
with
scorn
oh
how
i
loathe
apartments
they
seem
to
have
come
to
stay
my
dear
in
a
few
years
more
new
york
will
be
a
city
without
a
house
he
said
only
a
palace
here
and
there
the
thought
flashed
in
his
mind
but
i
shall
be
gone
then
we
move
out
to
the
country
she
cried
still
walking
the
floor
with
her
father
she
talked
of
the
perplexities
which
in
her
feverish
state
of
mind
had
loomed
suddenly
enormous
she
had
planned
everything
so
nicely
for
the
baby
to
come
the
first
of
june
but
now
her
plans
were
all
upset
she
did
not
want
the
children
here
it
would
make
too
much
confusion
they
had
much
better
go
up
to
the
mountains
even
though
george
and
elizabeth
lost
their
last
few
weeks
at
school
but
who
could
she
find
to
take
them
bruce
was
simply
rushed
to
death
with
his
new
receivership
laura
was
getting
her
trousseau
deborah
said
edith
had
time
for
nothing
on
earth
but
school
suppose
i
take
them
roger
ventured
but
she
only
smiled
at
this
my
dear
he
urged
your
nurse
will
be
with
me
and
when
we
arrive
the
farmer
wife
but
edith
impatiently
shook
her
head
her
warm
bright
eyes
seemed
to
picture
it
all
hour
by
hour
day
and
night
her
children
there
without
her
you
poor
dear
she
told
him
you
have
the
slightest
idea
what
it
means
the
summer
train
is
not
on
yet
and
you
have
to
change
three
times
on
the
way
with
all
the
children
luggage
too
and
there
are
their
naps
and
all
their
meals
you
do
arrive
till
late
at
night
no
she
decided
firmly
bruce
will
simply
have
to
go
she
drew
a
breath
of
discomfort
you
go
and
talk
to
him
she
said
i
will
my
dear
roger
looked
at
his
daughter
in
deep
concern
awkwardly
his
heavy
hand
touched
her
small
plump
shoulder
and
he
felt
the
constant
quivering
there
now
now
he
muttered
uneasily
it
going
to
be
all
right
you
know
and
at
that
she
gave
him
a
rapid
glance
out
of
those
warm
hunted
eyes
as
though
to
ask
what
do
you
know
of
this
and
roger
flinched
and
turned
to
the
door
bruce
was
working
at
his
desk
with
an
old
briar
pipe
in
his
teeth
he
looked
up
with
a
quick
nervous
smile
which
showed
his
dread
of
the
coming
ordeal
but
his
voice
had
a
carefully
casual
tone
does
she
want
me
now
he
asked
no
said
roger
and
he
told
of
her
plan
for
the
children
i
volunteered
myself
he
added
but
she
would
hear
to
it
oh
my
god
man
you
would
do
said
bruce
in
droll
disparagement
you
with
bottles
of
pasteurized
milk
suppose
you
smashed
one
where
you
be
moving
our
family
is
a
job
it
a
science
and
i
got
my
degree
he
rose
and
his
face
softened
poor
girl
she
must
worry
like
that
i
run
in
and
tell
her
i
do
it
myself
just
to
get
it
off
her
mind
he
went
to
his
wife
and
when
he
came
back
his
dark
features
appeared
a
little
more
drawn
poor
devil
thought
roger
he
scared
to
death
just
as
i
used
to
be
myself
pretty
tough
on
a
woman
is
it
bruce
muttered
smiling
constrainedly
did
baird
say
everything
going
well
baird
was
edith
physician
yes
he
was
here
this
afternoon
and
he
said
he
be
back
this
evening
bruce
stopped
with
a
queer
little
scowl
of
suspense
i
told
her
i
see
to
the
trip
with
the
kiddies
and
it
seemed
to
relieve
her
a
lot
his
eye
went
to
a
pile
of
documents
that
lay
on
the
desk
before
him
it
play
the
very
devil
with
business
taking
three
days
off
just
now
but
i
guess
i
can
manage
it
somehow
a
muscle
began
to
twitch
on
his
face
he
his
pipe
with
elaborate
care
and
looked
over
at
roger
confidingly
do
you
know
what
the
matter
with
kids
these
days
it
the
twentieth
century
he
said
it
a
disease
it
starts
in
their
teeth
no
modern
girl
can
get
married
unless
she
has
had
her
teeth
straightened
for
years
our
dentist
bill
this
year
alone
was
over
eight
hundred
dollars
but
that
is
all
it
gets
into
their
young
intestines
god
bless
and
makes
you
pasteurize
all
they
eat
it
gets
into
their
nerves
and
tears
up
and
your
only
chance
to
save
is
school
not
a
common
school
but
a
school
tuition
four
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
you
hire
a
dancing
teacher
besides
i
mean
a
rhythm
teacher
and
let
shake
it
out
of
their
feet
and
after
that
you
buy
clothes
not
fluffy
clothes
but
clothes
the
kind
which
always
cost
the
most
and
then
you
build
a
simple
home
in
a
simple
place
like
morristown
the
whole
idea
is
simplicity
if
you
ca
make
enough
to
buy
it
you
lost
if
you
can
make
enough
just
barely
enough
you
get
so
excited
you
lose
your
head
and
do
what
i
did
monday
the
two
men
smiled
at
each
other
roger
was
very
fond
of
bruce
what
did
you
do
monday
he
asked
i
bought
that
car
i
told
you
about
splendid
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
tell
me
all
about
it
and
while
bruce
rapidly
grew
engrossed
in
telling
of
the
car
fine
points
roger
pictured
his
upon
hot
summer
evenings
for
bruce
spent
his
summers
in
town
forgetting
his
business
for
a
time
and
speeding
out
into
the
country
then
he
thought
of
edith
and
the
tyranny
of
her
motherhood
always
draining
her
husband
purse
and
keeping
edith
so
wrapt
up
in
her
children
and
their
daily
needs
that
she
had
lost
all
interest
in
anything
outside
her
home
what
was
there
wrong
about
it
he
knew
that
edith
prided
herself
on
being
like
her
mother
but
judith
had
always
found
time
for
her
friends
he
himself
had
been
more
as
edith
was
now
how
quickly
after
judith
died
he
had
dropped
all
friends
all
interests
that
it
he
ruefully
told
himself
edith
takes
after
her
father
and
the
same
curious
feeling
which
he
had
had
with
laura
came
back
to
him
with
her
sister
this
daughter
too
was
a
part
of
himself
his
deep
instinctive
craving
to
keep
to
himself
and
his
family
was
living
on
in
edith
was
already
dominating
her
home
what
a
queer
mysterious
business
it
was
this
tie
between
a
man
and
his
child
he
was
thinking
of
this
when
baird
arrived
allan
baird
was
not
only
the
doctor
who
had
brought
edith
children
into
the
world
he
was
besides
an
intimate
friend
he
had
been
bruce
at
college
as
he
came
strolling
into
the
room
with
his
easy
greeting
of
well
folks
his
low
gruff
voice
his
muscular
frame
over
six
feet
two
and
the
kindly
calm
assurance
in
his
lean
strong
visage
gave
to
bruce
and
roger
the
feeling
of
safety
they
needed
for
this
kind
of
work
was
his
life
he
had
specialized
on
women
and
after
over
fifteen
years
of
toilsome
uphill
labor
he
had
become
at
one
of
the
big
gynecologists
he
was
taking
his
success
with
the
quiet
relish
of
a
man
who
had
had
to
work
for
it
hard
and
yet
he
had
not
been
spoiled
by
success
he
worked
even
harder
than
before
so
hard
in
fact
that
deborah
with
whom
through
bruce
and
edith
he
had
long
ago
struck
up
an
easy
bantering
friendship
had
sturdily
set
herself
the
task
of
prying
open
his
eyes
a
bit
she
had
taken
him
to
her
school
at
night
and
to
queer
little
foreign
cafés
and
baird
with
a
humor
of
his
own
had
retaliated
by
dragging
her
to
the
astor
roof
and
to
musical
plays
if
my
eyes
are
to
be
opened
he
had
doggedly
declared
i
propose
to
have
some
diamonds
in
the
scenery
and
a
little
cheery
ragtime
too
you
got
a
good
heart
deborah
gale
but
your
head
is
full
of
tenements
to
divert
bruce
thoughts
from
his
wife
baird
started
him
talking
of
his
work
in
six
weeks
bruce
had
crammed
his
mind
with
the
details
of
skyscraper
building
and
his
talk
was
bewildering
now
bristling
with
technical
terms
permeated
through
and
through
with
the
feeling
of
strain
and
fierce
competition
as
roger
listened
he
had
again
that
sharp
and
oppressive
sensation
of
a
savage
modern
town
unrelentingly
pressing
pressing
in
restlessly
he
glanced
at
baird
who
sat
listening
quietly
and
roger
thought
of
the
likeness
between
their
two
professions
for
bruce
too
was
a
surgeon
his
patients
were
the
husbands
in
their
distracting
offices
baird
were
the
wives
and
mothers
in
their
equally
distracting
homes
which
were
more
tense
the
husbands
or
wives
and
good
lord
what
was
it
all
about
this
feverish
strain
of
getting
and
spending
what
were
they
spending
their
very
life
blood
and
what
were
they
getting
happiness
what
did
most
of
them
know
of
real
happiness
how
little
they
knew
how
blind
they
were
and
yet
how
they
laughed
and
chattered
along
how
engrossed
in
their
little
games
what
children
oh
what
children
and
am
i
any
better
than
the
rest
do
i
know
what
i
after
what
about
he
left
them
soon
for
he
felt
very
tired
he
went
to
his
daughter
to
say
and
in
her
room
the
talk
he
had
heard
became
to
him
suddenly
remote
that
restless
world
of
small
account
for
in
edith
in
the
one
brief
hour
since
her
father
had
seen
her
last
there
had
come
a
great
transformation
into
her
face
an
eager
light
she
was
slipping
down
into
a
weird
small
world
which
for
a
brief
but
fearful
season
was
to
be
utterly
her
own
with
agony
and
bloody
sweat
and
joy
and
a
deep
mystery
clumsily
he
took
her
hand
it
was
moist
and
he
felt
it
clutch
his
own
he
heard
her
breathing
rapidly
he
said
in
a
husky
tone
i
be
so
glad
my
dear
so
glad
for
answer
she
gave
him
a
hurried
smile
a
glance
from
her
bright
restless
eyes
then
he
went
heavily
from
the
room
at
home
he
found
deborah
sitting
alone
with
a
pile
of
school
papers
in
her
lap
as
he
entered
she
slowly
turned
her
head
how
is
edith
she
asked
him
roger
told
of
his
visit
uptown
and
spoke
of
edith
anxiety
over
getting
the
children
up
to
the
farm
i
take
them
myself
said
deborah
but
how
can
you
get
away
from
school
oh
i
think
i
can
manage
it
we
leave
on
friday
morning
and
i
can
be
back
by
sunday
night
i
love
it
deborah
answered
it
be
a
great
relief
to
her
said
roger
lighting
a
cigar
deborah
resumed
her
work
and
there
was
silence
for
a
time
i
let
george
sit
up
with
me
till
an
hour
after
his
bedtime
she
told
her
father
presently
we
started
talking
about
white
rats
you
see
it
still
white
rats
with
george
and
that
started
us
wondering
about
god
george
wonders
if
god
really
knows
about
rats
he
ever
stuck
his
face
right
down
and
had
a
good
close
look
at
one
has
god
ever
watched
a
rat
stand
up
and
brush
his
whiskers
with
both
paws
has
he
ever
really
laughed
at
rats
and
that
another
thing
aunt
deborah
does
god
ever
laugh
at
all
does
he
know
how
to
take
a
joke
if
he
do
we
might
as
well
quit
right
now
roger
laughed
with
relish
and
his
daughter
smiled
at
him
then
the
talk
turned
from
rats
and
god
to
a
big
dam
out
in
the
rockies
george
has
been
reading
about
it
he
thinking
of
being
an
engineer
and
there
was
so
much
he
wanted
to
know
that
he
was
soon
upon
the
verge
of
discovering
my
ignorance
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
dreamy
look
oh
a
very
dreamy
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
asked
me
this
and
over
her
bright
expressive
face
came
a
scowl
of
boyish
intensity
suppose
i
an
engineer
and
i
was
working
on
a
dam
or
may
be
a
bridge
in
the
rockies
and
say
it
was
pretty
far
down
south
say
around
the
grand
canyon
i
should
think
they
need
a
dam
down
there
or
anyhow
a
bridge
said
george
and
he
eyed
me
in
a
cautious
way
which
said
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
lord
she
only
a
woman
and
she
wo
understand
but
i
showed
him
i
was
serious
and
he
asked
me
huskily
it
was
winter
aunt
deborah
and
the
giants
were
in
texas
do
you
think
i
could
get
a
few
days
off
and
then
before
he
could
tell
me
the
giants
were
a
baseball
nine
i
said
i
was
sure
he
could
manage
it
you
should
have
seen
his
face
light
up
and
he
added
very
fervently
it
must
be
wonderful
to
be
an
engineer
out
there
roger
chuckled
delightedly
and
deborah
went
on
with
her
work
how
good
she
is
with
young
uns
he
thought
what
a
knack
she
has
of
drawing
out
what
a
pity
she
has
some
of
her
own
he
slept
until
late
the
next
morning
and
awoke
to
find
deborah
by
his
bed
it
another
boy
she
told
him
roger
sat
up
excitedly
bruce
has
just
telephoned
the
news
the
children
and
i
have
breakfasted
and
they
going
out
with
their
nurse
suppose
you
and
i
go
up
and
see
bruce
and
settle
this
trip
to
the
mountains
about
an
hour
later
arriving
at
edith
apartment
they
found
bruce
downstairs
with
allan
baird
who
was
just
taking
his
departure
bruce
dark
eyes
shone
with
relief
but
his
hand
was
hot
and
nervous
allan
on
the
contrary
held
out
to
edith
father
a
hand
as
steady
and
relaxed
as
was
the
bantering
tone
of
his
voice
bruce
he
said
has
for
once
in
his
life
decided
to
do
something
sensible
he
going
to
drop
his
wretched
job
and
take
a
week
off
with
his
children
and
worry
every
minute
he
gone
deborah
retorted
and
come
back
and
work
day
and
night
to
catch
up
but
he
is
going
to
do
it
i
decided
to
take
the
children
myself
you
have
cried
bruce
delightedly
you
do
no
such
thing
said
allan
indignant
oh
you
go
to
thunder
bruce
put
in
have
you
any
delicacy
ca
you
see
this
is
no
business
of
yours
it
is
eh
allan
sternly
rejoined
and
of
deborah
he
demanded
you
say
you
go
with
me
to
this
saturday
night
ah
sneered
bruce
so
that
your
game
and
for
one
little
night
of
your
pleasure
you
do
me
out
of
a
week
of
my
life
like
that
said
baird
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
i
going
though
said
deborah
quite
right
little
woman
bruce
admonished
her
earnestly
do
let
him
rob
you
of
your
happiness
come
here
growled
baird
to
deborah
she
followed
him
into
the
living
room
and
roger
went
upstairs
with
bruce
if
he
ever
hopes
to
marry
that
girl
said
bruce
with
an
anxious
backward
glance
he
got
to
learn
to
treat
her
with
a
little
consideration
quit
your
quarreling
roger
said
what
a
week
in
the
mountains
to
you
has
your
wife
just
risked
her
life
sure
she
has
said
bruce
feelingly
and
i
propose
to
stick
by
her
too
can
i
see
her
no
you
ca
another
of
baird
fool
notions
then
where
the
baby
right
in
here
silently
in
front
of
the
cradle
bruce
and
roger
stood
looking
down
with
the
content
which
comes
to
men
on
such
occasions
when
there
is
no
woman
by
their
side
expecting
them
to
say
things
i
made
it
a
rule
in
my
family
roger
spoke
up
presently
to
have
my
first
look
at
each
child
alone
same
here
said
bruce
and
they
continued
their
silent
communion
a
few
moments
later
as
they
were
leaving
deborah
came
into
the
room
and
went
softly
to
the
cradle
downstairs
they
found
that
allan
had
gone
and
when
deborah
rejoined
them
she
said
she
was
going
to
stick
to
her
plan
it
was
soon
arranged
that
she
and
the
youngsters
should
start
on
their
journey
the
following
day
back
at
home
she
threw
herself
into
the
packing
and
was
busy
till
late
that
night
at
daybreak
she
was
up
again
for
they
were
to
make
an
early
start
bruce
came
with
his
new
automobile
the
children
were
all
bundled
in
together
with
deborah
and
their
nurse
and
a
half
hour
later
at
the
train
bruce
and
roger
left
them
deborah
flushed
and
happy
surrounded
by
luggage
wraps
small
boys
an
ice
box
toys
and
picture
books
the
small
red
hat
upon
her
head
had
already
been
jerked
in
a
scrimmage
far
down
over
one
of
her
ears
do
worry
about
us
bruce
she
said
we
going
to
have
the
time
of
our
lives
bruce
fairly
beamed
his
gratitude
if
she
do
marry
he
declared
as
he
watched
the
train
move
slowly
out
there
be
a
great
mother
wasted
chapter
vii
in
the
weeks
which
followed
roger
found
the
peace
of
his
home
so
interrupted
and
disturbed
by
wedding
preparations
that
often
retreating
into
his
den
he
earnestly
told
himself
he
was
through
that
a
man
with
three
grown
daughters
was
a
fool
to
show
any
sympathy
with
the
utter
folly
of
their
lives
yield
an
inch
and
they
took
a
mile
it
began
one
night
when
deborah
said
now
dearie
i
think
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
to
give
laura
just
the
kind
of
wedding
she
likes
and
roger
weakly
agreed
to
this
but
as
time
wore
on
he
discovered
that
the
kind
of
wedding
laura
liked
was
a
thing
that
made
his
blood
run
cold
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
whatever
to
the
young
bride
blithe
demands
the
trousseau
part
of
it
he
did
mind
to
the
gowns
and
hats
and
gloves
and
shoes
and
trunks
and
jaunty
travelling
bags
which
came
pouring
into
the
house
he
made
no
objection
all
that
he
considered
was
fair
play
but
what
got
on
roger
nerves
was
this
frantic
fuss
and
change
the
faded
hall
carpet
had
to
come
up
his
favorite
lounge
was
whisked
away
the
piano
was
while
he
was
trying
to
take
a
nap
rugs
were
beaten
crates
and
barrels
filled
the
halls
and
one
whole
bedroom
stripped
and
bare
was
transformed
into
a
shop
where
the
wedding
presents
were
displayed
in
the
shuffle
his
box
of
cigars
disappeared
in
short
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
and
deborah
was
as
bad
as
the
bride
at
times
it
appeared
to
roger
as
though
her
fingers
fairly
itched
to
jab
and
tug
at
his
poor
old
house
which
wore
an
air
of
mute
reproach
she
revealed
a
part
of
her
nature
that
he
viewed
with
dark
amazement
every
hour
she
could
spare
from
school
she
was
changing
something
or
other
at
home
with
an
eager
glitter
in
her
eyes
doing
it
all
for
laura
she
said
fiddlesticks
and
rubbish
she
did
it
because
she
liked
it
in
gloomy
wrath
one
afternoon
he
went
up
to
see
edith
and
quiet
down
she
was
well
on
the
way
to
recovery
but
instead
of
receiving
solace
here
he
only
found
fresh
troubles
for
sitting
up
in
her
bed
with
an
cap
of
lace
upon
her
shapely
little
head
edith
made
her
father
feel
she
had
washed
her
hands
of
the
whole
affair
i
sorry
she
said
in
an
injured
tone
that
laura
does
care
enough
about
her
oldest
sister
to
put
off
the
wedding
two
or
three
weeks
so
i
could
be
there
it
seems
rather
undignified
i
think
for
a
girl
to
hurry
her
wedding
so
i
should
have
loved
to
make
it
the
dear
simple
kind
of
wedding
which
mother
would
have
wanted
but
so
long
as
she
does
care
for
that
and
in
fact
has
only
found
ten
minutes
once
to
run
in
and
see
the
baby
in
dismay
her
father
found
himself
defending
the
very
daughter
of
whom
he
had
come
to
complain
it
was
not
such
a
short
engagement
he
said
he
had
learned
they
had
been
engaged
some
time
before
they
told
him
do
you
approve
of
that
she
rejoined
when
i
was
engaged
i
made
bruce
go
to
you
before
i
even
let
him
here
edith
broke
off
primly
of
course
that
was
some
time
ago
an
engagement
laura
tells
me
is
mere
experiment
nowadays
they
till
they
feel
quite
sure
then
notify
their
parents
and
get
married
in
a
week
she
is
rushing
it
i
admit
roger
soothingly
replied
but
she
has
her
mind
set
on
paris
in
june
paris
in
june
said
edith
sums
up
in
three
words
laura
whole
conception
of
marriage
you
really
ought
to
talk
to
her
father
it
your
duty
it
seems
to
me
what
do
you
mean
i
rather
not
tell
you
edith
glance
went
sternly
to
the
cradle
by
her
bed
laura
pities
me
she
said
for
having
had
five
children
oh
now
my
dear
girl
she
does
though
she
said
as
much
when
she
dropped
in
the
other
day
and
i
tried
to
be
sympathetic
and
give
her
a
little
sound
advice
she
said
i
had
had
the
wedding
i
liked
and
the
kind
of
married
life
i
liked
and
she
was
going
to
have
hers
and
she
made
it
quite
plain
that
her
kind
is
to
include
no
children
it
to
be
simply
an
effort
to
find
by
whether
or
not
she
loves
hal
sloane
if
she
does
edith
gave
a
slight
but
emphatic
wave
of
dismissal
do
you
mean
to
say
laura
told
you
that
her
father
asked
with
an
angry
frown
i
mean
she
made
me
feel
it
as
plainly
as
i
telling
it
what
i
understand
his
daughter
went
on
is
deborah
attitude
in
the
affair
what
the
matter
with
deborah
inquired
roger
dismally
oh
nothing
the
matter
with
deborah
she
quite
she
at
least
can
play
with
modern
ideas
and
keep
her
head
while
she
doing
it
but
when
poor
laura
a
mere
child
with
the
mind
of
a
chicken
catches
vaguely
at
such
ideas
applies
them
to
her
own
little
self
and
risks
her
whole
future
happiness
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
criminal
for
deborah
not
to
interfere
not
even
a
word
of
warning
deborah
believes
said
her
father
in
everyone
leading
his
own
life
that
rot
was
edith
curt
reply
do
i
lead
my
own
life
does
bruce
do
you
no
growled
roger
feelingly
do
my
children
edith
demanded
i
know
deborah
would
like
them
to
that
her
latest
and
most
modern
fad
to
run
a
school
where
every
child
shall
sit
with
a
rat
in
its
lap
or
a
goat
and
do
just
what
he
pleases
follow
his
natural
bent
she
says
i
hope
she
wo
come
up
to
the
mountains
and
practice
on
my
children
i
should
hate
to
break
with
deborah
edith
ended
thoughtfully
roger
rose
and
walked
the
room
the
comforting
idea
entered
his
mind
that
when
the
wedding
was
over
he
would
take
out
his
collection
of
rings
and
carefully
polish
every
one
but
even
this
hope
did
not
stay
with
him
long
with
laura
at
home
he
heard
edith
continue
you
at
least
had
a
daughter
to
run
your
house
if
deborah
tries
to
move
you
out
she
wo
cried
roger
in
alarm
if
she
does
persisted
edith
or
if
she
begins
any
talk
of
the
kind
you
come
to
me
and
talk
to
her
her
father
walked
in
silence
his
head
down
frowning
at
the
floor
it
seems
funny
edith
continued
that
women
like
me
who
give
children
their
lives
and
men
like
bruce
who
are
building
new
york
actually
doing
it
all
the
time
have
so
little
to
say
in
these
modern
ideas
i
suppose
it
because
we
a
little
too
real
to
come
back
to
the
wedding
roger
suggested
to
come
back
to
the
wedding
father
dear
his
daughter
said
compassionately
i
afraid
it
going
to
be
a
form
which
will
make
you
rather
wretched
when
you
get
so
you
ca
endure
it
come
in
and
see
me
and
the
baby
as
he
started
for
home
her
words
of
warning
recurred
to
his
mind
yes
here
was
the
thing
that
disturbed
him
most
the
ghost
lurking
under
all
this
confusion
the
part
which
had
to
do
with
himself
it
was
bad
enough
to
know
that
his
daughter
his
own
flesh
and
blood
was
about
to
settle
her
fate
at
one
throw
but
to
be
moved
out
of
his
house
bag
and
baggage
roger
strode
wrathfully
up
the
street
it
your
duty
to
talk
to
her
edith
had
said
and
he
meditated
darkly
on
this
maybe
i
will
and
maybe
i
wo
i
know
my
duties
without
being
told
how
does
edith
know
what
her
mother
liked
we
had
our
own
likings
her
mother
and
i
and
our
own
ideas
long
after
she
was
tucked
into
bed
and
yet
she
always
harping
on
mother
would
have
wanted
what
i
should
like
to
know
right
now
is
what
judith
would
want
if
she
were
here
with
a
pang
of
utter
loneliness
amid
these
vexing
problems
roger
felt
it
crowding
in
this
city
of
his
children
lives
as
he
strode
on
down
broadway
an
old
hag
selling
papers
thrust
one
in
his
face
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
headline
some
bigwig
woman
how
about
experiment
a
mob
of
street
urchins
nearly
upset
him
how
about
deborah
how
about
children
how
about
schools
education
the
country
how
about
god
was
anyone
thinking
had
anyone
time
what
a
racket
it
made
along
the
taxis
and
motor
trucks
thundered
and
brayed
dark
masses
of
people
swept
endlessly
by
as
though
their
very
souls
depended
on
their
dinners
or
their
jobs
their
movies
roaring
farces
thrills
their
harum
scarum
dances
clothes
a
plump
little
fool
of
a
woman
her
skirt
so
tight
she
could
barely
walk
tripped
by
on
slippers
that
was
it
he
told
himself
the
whole
city
was
no
solid
footing
anywhere
and
good
lord
how
they
chattered
he
turned
into
a
less
noisy
street
what
would
judith
want
if
she
were
here
it
became
disturbingly
clear
to
him
that
she
would
undoubtedly
wish
him
to
have
a
talk
with
laura
now
find
out
if
she
really
made
up
her
mind
not
to
have
any
children
and
if
so
to
tell
her
plainly
that
she
was
not
only
going
against
her
god
but
risking
her
own
happiness
for
though
judith
had
been
liberal
about
any
number
of
smaller
things
she
had
been
decidedly
clear
on
this
yes
he
must
talk
to
laura
and
she
tell
me
he
reflected
that
edith
put
me
up
to
it
if
only
his
oldest
daughter
would
leave
the
other
girls
alone
here
she
was
planning
a
row
with
deborah
over
whether
poor
young
george
should
be
allowed
to
play
with
rats
it
was
all
so
silly
yes
his
three
children
were
drifting
apart
each
one
of
them
going
her
separate
way
and
he
rather
took
comfort
in
the
thought
for
at
least
it
would
stop
their
wrangling
but
again
he
pulled
himself
up
with
a
jerk
no
certainly
judith
would
not
have
liked
this
if
she
ever
stood
for
anything
it
was
for
keeping
the
family
together
it
had
been
the
heart
and
center
of
their
last
talks
before
she
died
his
face
relaxed
as
he
walked
on
but
in
his
eyes
was
a
deeper
pain
if
only
judith
could
be
here
before
he
reached
home
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
talk
with
laura
that
very
night
he
drew
out
his
latchkey
opened
his
door
shut
it
firmly
and
strode
into
his
house
in
the
hall
they
were
putting
down
the
new
carpet
cautiously
picking
his
way
upstairs
he
inquired
for
laura
and
was
told
she
was
dressing
for
dinner
he
knocked
at
her
door
yes
came
her
voice
it
i
he
said
your
father
oh
hello
dad
came
the
answer
gaily
in
that
high
sweet
voice
of
hers
i
frightfully
rushed
it
a
dinner
dance
for
the
bridesmaids
and
the
ushers
roger
felt
a
glow
of
relief
come
in
a
moment
you
what
a
resplendent
young
creature
she
was
seated
at
her
dresser
behind
her
the
maid
with
needle
and
thread
was
swiftly
mending
a
little
tear
in
the
fluffy
blue
tulle
she
was
wearing
the
shaded
light
just
over
her
head
brought
a
shimmer
of
red
in
her
sleek
brown
hair
what
lips
she
had
what
a
bosom
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
smiled
at
him
what
are
you
doing
night
her
father
asked
her
oh
dad
my
love
we
have
every
evening
filled
and
crammed
right
up
to
the
wedding
she
replied
no
the
last
evening
i
be
here
hal
giving
his
ushers
a
dinner
that
night
good
i
want
to
talk
to
you
my
dear
he
felt
his
voice
solemn
a
great
mistake
he
saw
the
quick
glance
from
her
luminous
eyes
all
right
father
whenever
you
like
much
embarrassed
roger
left
the
room
the
few
days
which
remained
were
a
crowding
confusion
of
dressmakers
gowns
and
chattering
friends
and
gifts
arriving
at
all
hours
as
a
part
of
his
resolve
to
do
what
he
could
for
his
daughter
roger
stayed
home
from
his
office
that
week
but
all
he
could
do
was
to
unpack
boxes
take
out
presents
and
keep
the
cards
and
say
yes
my
dear
it
very
nice
where
shall
i
put
this
one
as
the
array
of
presents
grew
from
time
to
time
unconsciously
he
glanced
at
the
engagement
ring
upon
laura
finger
and
all
the
presents
seemed
like
that
they
would
suit
her
apartment
beautifully
he
be
glad
when
they
were
out
of
the
house
the
only
gift
that
appealed
to
his
fancy
was
a
brooch
neither
rich
nor
new
a
genuine
bit
of
old
jewelry
but
rather
to
his
annoyance
he
learned
that
it
had
been
sent
to
laura
by
the
old
galician
jew
in
the
shop
around
the
corner
it
recalled
to
his
mind
the
curious
friendship
which
had
existed
for
so
long
between
the
old
man
and
his
daughter
and
as
she
turned
the
brooch
to
the
light
roger
thought
he
saw
in
her
eyes
anticipations
which
made
him
uneasy
yes
she
was
a
child
of
his
june
in
paris
other
junes
experiments
no
children
again
he
felt
he
must
have
that
talk
but
good
lord
how
he
dreaded
it
the
house
was
almost
ready
now
dismantled
and
made
new
and
strange
it
was
the
night
before
the
wedding
laura
was
taking
her
supper
in
bed
what
was
he
going
to
say
to
her
he
ate
his
dinner
silently
at
last
he
rose
with
grim
resolution
i
think
i
go
up
and
see
her
he
said
deborah
quickly
glanced
at
him
what
for
she
asked
oh
i
just
want
to
talk
to
her
do
stay
long
she
admonished
him
i
a
masseuse
coming
at
nine
to
get
the
child
in
condition
to
rest
her
nerves
are
rather
tense
you
know
how
about
mine
he
said
to
himself
as
he
started
upstairs
never
mind
i
got
to
tackle
it
laura
saw
what
he
meant
to
say
the
moment
that
he
entered
the
room
and
the
tightening
of
her
features
made
it
all
the
harder
for
roger
to
think
clearly
to
remember
the
grave
kind
fatherly
things
which
he
had
intended
to
tell
her
i
do
want
to
talk
of
the
wedding
child
but
of
what
coming
after
that
between
you
and
this
man
all
your
life
he
stopped
short
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
for
although
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
had
a
quick
sensation
as
though
he
had
struck
her
in
the
face
is
this
rather
late
to
speak
about
that
just
now
when
i
nervous
enough
as
it
is
i
know
i
know
he
spoke
hurriedly
humbly
i
should
have
talked
to
you
long
ago
i
should
have
known
you
better
child
i
been
slack
and
selfish
but
it
better
late
than
never
but
you
need
the
girl
exclaimed
you
need
tell
me
anything
i
know
more
than
you
think
i
know
enough
roger
looked
at
her
then
at
the
wall
she
went
on
in
a
voice
rather
breathless
i
know
what
doing
exactly
just
what
i
getting
into
it
not
as
it
was
when
you
were
young
it
different
we
talk
of
these
things
harold
and
i
have
talked
it
all
out
in
the
brief
and
dangerous
pause
which
followed
roger
kept
looking
at
the
wall
have
you
talked
about
having
children
yes
came
the
answer
sharply
and
then
he
felt
the
hot
clutch
of
her
hand
had
you
better
go
now
dad
he
hesitated
no
he
said
his
voice
was
low
do
you
mean
to
have
children
laura
i
do
know
i
think
you
do
know
do
you
mean
to
have
children
her
big
black
eyes
dilating
were
fixed
defiantly
on
his
own
well
then
no
i
do
she
replied
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
think
what
he
could
say
to
her
good
god
how
he
was
bungling
where
were
all
his
arguments
how
about
your
religion
he
blurted
out
i
have
any
which
makes
me
do
that
i
a
right
to
be
happy
you
have
his
voice
had
suddenly
changed
in
accent
and
in
quality
it
was
like
a
voice
from
the
heart
of
new
england
where
he
had
been
born
and
bred
i
mean
you
wo
be
happy
not
unless
you
have
a
child
it
what
you
need
it
fill
your
life
it
settle
you
deepen
you
tone
you
down
suppose
i
do
want
to
be
toned
down
the
girl
was
almost
hysterical
i
no
puritan
i
want
to
live
i
tell
you
we
are
different
now
we
not
all
like
edith
and
we
not
like
our
mothers
we
want
to
live
and
we
have
a
right
to
why
do
you
go
ca
you
see
i
nearly
crazy
it
my
last
night
my
very
last
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
i
do
even
know
what
i
saying
and
you
come
and
try
to
frighten
me
her
voice
caught
and
broke
into
sobs
you
know
nothing
about
me
you
never
did
leave
me
alone
ca
you
leave
me
alone
father
he
heard
deborah
voice
abrupt
and
stern
outside
the
door
i
sorry
he
said
hoarsely
he
went
in
blind
fashion
out
of
the
room
and
down
to
his
study
he
lit
a
cigar
and
smoked
wretchedly
there
when
presently
deborah
appeared
he
saw
that
her
face
was
set
and
hard
but
as
she
caught
the
baffled
look
the
angry
tortured
light
in
his
eyes
her
own
expression
softened
poor
father
she
said
in
a
pitying
way
if
edith
had
only
let
you
alone
i
certainly
did
do
much
good
of
course
you
did
you
did
harm
oh
so
much
more
harm
than
you
know
into
the
quiet
voice
of
his
daughter
crept
a
note
of
keen
regret
i
wanted
to
make
her
last
days
in
this
house
a
time
she
could
look
back
on
so
that
she
want
to
come
home
for
help
if
ever
she
in
trouble
she
has
so
little
do
you
see
of
what
a
woman
needs
these
days
she
has
grown
up
so
badly
oh
if
you
only
let
her
alone
it
was
such
a
bad
bad
time
to
choose
she
went
to
her
father
and
kissed
him
well
it
over
now
she
said
and
we
make
the
best
we
can
of
it
i
tell
her
you
sorry
and
quiet
her
down
and
we
try
to
forget
it
has
happened
for
roger
the
morrow
went
by
in
a
whirl
the
wedding
a
large
church
affair
was
to
take
place
at
twelve
he
arose
early
put
on
his
prince
albert
went
down
and
ate
his
breakfast
alone
the
waitress
was
flustered
the
coffee
was
burnt
he
finished
and
anxiously
wandered
about
the
maids
were
bustling
in
and
out
with
deborah
giving
orders
pellmell
the
caterers
came
trooping
in
the
bridesmaids
were
arriving
and
hurrying
up
to
roger
room
that
place
was
soon
a
chaos
of
voices
giggles
peals
of
laughter
laura
trunks
were
brought
downstairs
and
roger
tagged
them
for
the
ship
one
for
the
cabin
and
three
for
the
hold
and
saw
them
into
the
wagon
then
he
strode
distractedly
everywhere
till
at
last
he
was
hustled
by
deborah
into
a
taxi
waiting
outside
it
all
going
so
smoothly
deborah
said
and
a
faint
sardonic
glimmer
came
into
her
father
hunted
eyes
deborah
was
funny
soon
he
found
himself
in
the
church
he
heard
whispers
eager
voices
heard
one
usher
say
to
another
god
what
a
terrible
head
i
got
and
roger
glared
at
him
for
that
plainly
these
youngsters
all
mere
boys
had
been
up
with
the
groom
a
good
part
of
the
night
but
here
was
laura
pale
and
tense
she
smiled
at
him
and
squeezed
his
hand
there
was
silence
then
the
organ
and
now
he
was
taking
her
up
the
aisle
strange
faces
stared
his
jaw
set
hard
at
last
they
reached
the
altar
an
usher
quickly
touched
his
arm
and
he
stepped
back
where
he
belonged
he
listened
but
understood
nothing
just
words
words
and
motions
if
any
man
can
show
just
cause
why
they
may
not
be
lawfully
joined
together
let
him
now
speak
or
else
hereafter
forever
hold
his
peace
no
thought
roger
i
wo
speak
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
deborah
face
and
at
the
look
in
her
steady
gray
eyes
all
at
once
he
could
feel
the
hot
tears
in
his
own
at
the
wedding
breakfast
he
was
gay
to
a
boisterous
degree
he
talked
to
strange
women
and
brought
them
food
took
punch
with
men
he
had
never
laid
eyes
on
went
off
on
a
feverish
hunt
for
cigars
came
back
distractedly
joked
with
young
girls
and
even
started
some
of
them
dancing
the
whole
affair
was
over
in
no
time
the
bride
and
the
groom
came
rushing
downstairs
and
as
they
escaped
from
the
shower
of
rice
roger
ran
after
them
down
the
steps
he
gripped
sloane
hand
remember
boy
it
her
whole
life
entreated
roger
hoarsely
yes
sir
i
look
out
no
fear
daddy
god
bless
you
dear
they
were
speeding
away
and
with
the
best
man
who
looked
weary
and
spent
roger
went
slowly
back
up
the
steps
it
was
an
effort
now
to
talk
thank
heaven
these
people
soon
were
gone
last
of
all
went
the
ponderous
aunt
of
the
groom
how
the
taxi
groaned
as
he
helped
her
inside
and
started
her
off
to
bridgeport
back
in
his
study
he
found
his
cigars
and
smoked
one
dismally
with
bruce
bruce
was
a
decent
sort
of
chap
he
knew
when
to
be
silent
well
he
spoke
finally
rising
i
guess
i
have
to
get
back
to
the
office
he
smiled
a
little
and
put
his
hand
on
roger
weary
shoulder
we
glad
it
over
eh
he
asked
bruce
said
roger
heavily
you
got
a
girl
of
your
own
growing
up
do
let
her
grow
to
feel
you
old
live
on
with
her
she
need
you
his
massive
blunt
face
darkened
the
world
so
damnably
new
he
muttered
so
choked
up
with
fool
ideas
bruce
still
smiled
affectionately
go
up
and
see
edith
he
said
and
forget
she
never
lets
one
into
the
flat
she
said
you
were
to
be
sure
to
come
and
tell
her
about
the
wedding
all
right
i
go
said
roger
he
hunted
about
for
his
hat
and
coat
what
a
devilish
mess
they
had
made
of
the
house
a
half
hour
later
he
was
with
edith
but
there
despite
his
efforts
to
answer
all
her
questions
he
grew
heavier
and
heavier
till
at
last
he
barely
spoke
he
sat
watching
edith
baby
did
you
talk
to
laura
he
heard
her
ask
yes
he
replied
it
did
no
good
he
knew
that
edith
was
waiting
for
more
but
he
kept
doggedly
silent
well
dear
she
said
presently
at
least
you
did
what
you
could
for
her
i
never
done
what
i
could
he
rejoined
not
with
any
one
of
you
he
glanced
at
her
with
a
twinge
of
pain
i
do
know
as
it
would
have
helped
much
if
i
had
this
town
is
running
away
with
itself
i
want
a
rest
now
edith
i
want
things
quiet
for
a
while
he
felt
her
anxious
pitying
look
where
deborah
she
asked
him
gone
back
to
school
already
i
do
know
where
she
is
he
replied
and
then
he
rose
forlornly
i
guess
i
be
going
back
home
he
said
on
his
way
as
his
thoughts
slowly
cleared
the
old
uneasiness
rose
in
his
mind
would
deborah
want
to
keep
the
house
suppose
she
suggested
moving
to
some
little
flat
no
he
would
not
stand
in
her
way
but
lord
what
an
end
to
make
of
his
life
his
home
was
almost
dark
inside
but
he
noticed
rather
to
his
surprise
that
the
rooms
had
already
been
put
in
order
he
sank
down
on
the
living
room
sofa
and
lay
motionless
for
a
while
how
tired
he
was
from
time
to
time
he
drearily
sighed
yes
deborah
would
find
him
old
and
life
here
dull
and
lonely
where
was
she
he
wondered
could
she
quit
her
zoo
school
for
one
single
afternoon
at
last
when
the
room
had
grown
pitch
dark
he
heard
the
maid
lighting
the
gas
in
the
hall
roger
loudly
cleared
his
throat
and
at
the
sound
the
startled
girl
ejaculated
oh
my
gawd
it
i
said
roger
sternly
did
miss
deborah
say
when
she
be
back
she
did
go
out
sir
she
up
in
her
room
roger
went
up
and
found
her
there
all
afternoon
with
both
the
maids
she
had
been
setting
the
house
to
rights
and
now
she
ached
in
every
limb
she
was
lying
on
her
bed
and
she
looked
as
though
she
had
been
crying
where
have
you
been
she
inquired
at
edith
her
father
answered
she
reached
up
and
took
his
hand
and
held
it
slowly
tighter
you
are
going
to
find
it
too
lonely
here
with
laura
gone
she
asked
him
and
the
wistfulness
in
her
deep
sweet
voice
made
something
thrill
in
roger
why
should
i
he
retorted
deborah
gave
a
queer
little
laugh
oh
i
just
silly
that
all
she
said
i
been
having
a
fit
of
blues
i
been
feeling
so
old
this
afternoon
a
regular
old
woman
i
wanted
you
dearie
and
i
was
afraid
that
you
she
broke
off
look
here
said
roger
sharply
do
you
really
want
to
keep
this
house
keep
this
house
why
father
you
think
you
can
stand
it
here
alone
just
the
two
of
us
he
demanded
i
can
cried
deborah
happily
her
father
walked
to
the
window
there
as
he
looked
blindly
out
his
eyes
were
assaulted
by
the
lights
of
all
those
flats
and
a
look
of
vicious
triumph
appeared
for
a
moment
on
his
face
very
well
he
said
quietly
turning
back
then
we
both
suited
he
went
to
the
door
i
go
and
wash
up
for
supper
he
said
chapter
viii
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
find
how
smoothly
he
and
deborah
dropped
back
into
their
old
relations
it
was
good
to
get
home
those
evenings
for
in
this
new
stage
of
its
existence
with
its
family
of
two
the
house
appeared
to
have
filled
itself
with
a
deep
reposeful
feeling
laura
had
gone
out
of
its
life
he
glanced
into
her
room
one
night
and
it
looked
like
a
guest
room
now
the
sight
of
it
brought
him
a
pang
of
regret
but
the
big
ship
which
was
bearing
her
swiftly
away
to
paris
in
june
seemed
bearing
off
roger
uneasiness
too
he
could
smile
at
his
former
fears
for
laura
was
safely
married
and
wildly
in
love
with
her
husband
time
he
thought
would
take
care
of
the
rest
occasionally
he
missed
her
here
her
voice
but
musical
chatting
and
laughing
at
the
her
bustle
of
dressing
to
go
out
glimpses
of
her
extravagances
of
her
smart
suits
and
evening
gowns
of
all
the
joyous
color
and
dash
that
she
had
given
to
his
home
but
these
regrets
soon
died
away
the
old
house
shed
them
easily
as
though
glad
to
enter
this
long
rest
for
the
story
of
his
family
from
roger
point
of
view
at
least
was
a
long
uneven
narrative
with
prolonged
periods
of
peace
and
again
with
events
piling
one
on
the
other
and
now
there
came
one
of
those
peaceful
times
and
roger
liked
the
quiet
the
old
routine
was
his
dinner
his
paper
his
cigar
and
then
his
book
for
the
evening
some
good
novel
or
some
pleasant
book
of
travel
which
he
and
judith
had
read
aloud
when
they
were
planning
out
their
lives
they
had
meant
to
go
abroad
so
often
when
the
children
had
grown
up
and
he
liked
to
read
about
it
still
life
was
so
quiet
over
the
sea
things
were
so
old
and
mellow
there
he
resumed
too
his
horseback
rides
and
on
the
way
home
he
would
stop
in
for
a
visit
with
edith
and
her
baby
the
wee
boy
grew
funnier
every
day
with
his
sudden
kicks
and
sneezes
his
waving
fists
and
mighty
yawns
and
roger
felt
drawn
to
his
daughter
here
for
in
these
grateful
seasons
of
rest
that
followed
the
birth
of
each
of
her
children
edith
loved
to
lie
very
still
and
make
new
plans
for
her
small
brood
only
once
she
spoke
of
laura
and
then
it
was
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
gather
together
all
the
bills
his
daughter
had
doubtless
left
behind
if
you
do
settle
them
edith
said
they
go
to
her
husband
and
you
would
like
that
would
you
roger
said
he
would
see
to
it
and
one
evening
after
dinner
he
started
in
on
laura
bills
it
was
rather
an
appalling
time
he
looked
into
his
bank
account
and
found
that
laura
wedding
would
take
about
all
his
surplus
but
this
did
not
dismay
him
much
for
money
matters
never
did
it
simply
meant
more
work
in
the
office
the
next
day
he
rose
early
and
was
in
his
office
by
nine
he
had
not
been
so
prompt
in
months
and
many
of
his
employees
came
in
late
that
morning
but
nobody
seemed
very
much
perturbed
for
roger
was
an
easy
employer
still
he
sternly
told
himself
he
had
been
letting
things
get
altogether
too
slack
he
had
been
neglecting
his
business
again
the
work
had
become
so
cut
and
dried
there
was
nothing
creative
left
to
do
it
had
not
been
so
in
years
gone
by
those
years
had
fairly
bristled
with
ideas
and
hopes
and
schemes
but
even
those
old
memories
were
no
longer
here
to
hearten
him
they
had
all
been
swept
away
when
bruce
had
made
him
move
out
of
his
office
in
a
dark
creaky
edifice
down
close
under
brooklyn
bridge
and
come
up
to
this
new
building
this
caravansary
for
all
kinds
of
business
ventures
this
place
of
varnished
woodwork
floods
of
daylight
concrete
floors
this
building
fireproof
throughout
that
expressed
it
exactly
roger
thought
nothing
could
take
fire
here
not
even
a
man
imagination
even
though
he
did
not
feel
old
now
and
then
in
the
elevator
as
some
youngster
with
eager
eyes
pushed
nervously
against
him
roger
would
frown
and
wonder
what
are
you
so
excited
about
but
again
the
business
was
running
down
and
this
time
he
must
jerk
it
back
before
it
got
beyond
him
he
set
himself
doggedly
to
the
task
calling
in
his
assistants
one
by
one
going
through
the
work
in
those
outer
rooms
where
at
tables
long
rows
of
busy
young
girls
with
colored
pencils
scissors
and
paste
were
demolishing
enormous
piles
of
newspapers
and
magazines
and
vaguely
little
by
little
he
came
to
a
realization
of
how
while
he
had
slumbered
the
life
of
the
country
had
swept
on
for
as
he
studied
the
lists
and
the
letters
of
his
patrons
roger
felt
confusedly
that
a
new
america
was
here
clippings
clippings
clippings
business
men
and
business
firms
gigantic
corporations
kept
sending
here
for
clippings
news
of
themselves
or
their
rivals
keeping
keen
watch
on
each
other
affairs
for
signs
of
strength
or
weakness
how
savage
was
the
fight
these
days
here
was
news
of
mines
and
mills
and
factories
all
over
the
land
clippings
sent
each
morning
by
special
messengers
downtown
to
reach
the
brokers
offices
before
the
market
opened
one
broker
wrote
please
quote
your
terms
for
the
following
from
nine
to
two
each
day
our
messenger
will
call
at
your
office
every
hour
for
clippings
giving
information
of
the
companies
named
below
the
long
list
appended
carried
roger
fancy
out
all
over
the
continent
and
then
came
this
injunction
remember
that
our
messenger
must
leave
your
office
every
hour
in
information
of
this
kind
every
minute
counts
clippings
clippings
clippings
as
roger
turned
over
his
morning
mail
in
spite
of
himself
he
grew
absorbed
what
a
change
in
the
world
of
literature
what
a
host
of
names
of
scribblers
not
authors
but
just
writers
not
only
men
but
women
too
novelists
and
dramatists
poets
and
muckrakers
all
jumbled
in
together
each
one
of
them
straining
for
a
place
and
the
actors
and
the
actresses
the
musicians
and
the
lecturers
each
with
his
press
agent
and
avid
for
publicity
fame
and
here
were
society
women
from
new
york
and
other
cities
all
eager
for
press
notices
of
social
affairs
they
had
given
or
managed
charity
work
they
had
conducted
suffrage
speeches
they
had
made
half
the
women
in
the
land
were
fairly
talking
their
heads
off
it
seemed
some
had
been
on
his
lists
for
years
they
married
and
wanted
to
hear
what
was
said
in
the
papers
about
their
weddings
they
quarreled
and
got
divorces
and
still
sent
here
for
clippings
they
died
and
still
their
relatives
wrote
in
for
the
funeral
notices
and
even
death
was
commercialized
a
maker
of
monuments
wanted
news
of
all
people
of
large
means
dead
or
dangerously
ill
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
here
were
demands
from
charity
bodies
hospitals
and
colleges
from
clergymen
with
an
anxious
eye
on
the
monday
morning
papers
and
here
was
an
anarchist
millionaire
and
here
was
an
insane
asylum
wanting
to
see
itself
in
print
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
heavy
visage
roger
stared
out
of
his
window
slowly
the
smile
faded
a
wistful
look
came
on
his
face
who
take
my
business
when
i
gone
if
his
small
son
had
only
lived
with
what
new
zest
and
vigor
it
might
have
been
made
to
grow
and
expand
if
only
his
son
had
been
here
by
his
side
chapter
ix
deborah
needed
rest
he
thought
for
the
bright
attractive
face
of
his
daughter
was
looking
rather
pale
of
late
and
the
birthmark
on
her
forehead
showed
a
faint
thin
line
of
red
one
night
at
dinner
watching
her
he
wondered
what
was
on
her
mind
she
had
come
in
late
and
though
several
times
she
had
made
an
effort
to
keep
up
the
conversation
her
cheeks
were
almost
colorless
and
more
than
once
in
her
deepset
eyes
came
a
flash
of
pain
that
startled
him
look
here
what
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
deborah
looked
up
quickly
i
rather
not
talk
about
it
dad
very
well
he
answered
and
with
a
slight
hesitation
but
i
think
i
know
the
trouble
he
said
and
perhaps
some
other
time
when
you
do
feel
like
talking
he
stopped
for
on
her
wide
sensitive
lips
he
saw
a
twitch
of
amusement
what
do
you
think
is
the
trouble
she
asked
and
roger
looked
at
her
squarely
loneliness
he
answered
why
she
asked
him
well
there
edith
baby
and
laura
getting
married
i
see
and
so
i
lonely
for
a
family
of
my
own
but
you
forgetting
my
school
she
said
yes
yes
i
know
he
retorted
but
that
not
at
all
the
same
interesting
work
no
doubt
but
well
it
is
personal
oh
is
it
she
answered
and
she
drew
a
quivering
breath
rising
from
the
table
she
went
into
the
living
room
and
there
a
few
moments
later
he
found
her
walking
up
and
down
i
think
i
will
tell
you
now
she
said
i
afraid
of
being
alone
of
keeping
this
matter
to
myself
he
looked
at
her
apprehensively
very
well
my
dear
he
said
this
is
the
trouble
she
began
down
in
my
school
we
a
family
of
about
three
thousand
children
a
few
i
get
to
know
so
well
i
try
to
follow
them
when
they
leave
and
one
of
these
an
italian
boy
his
name
is
joe
bolini
was
one
of
the
best
i
ever
had
and
one
of
the
most
appealing
but
joe
took
to
drinking
and
got
in
with
a
gang
of
boys
who
blackmailed
small
shopkeepers
he
used
to
come
to
me
at
times
in
occasional
moods
of
repentance
he
was
a
splendid
physical
type
and
he
been
a
leader
in
our
athletics
so
i
took
him
back
into
the
school
to
manage
our
teams
in
he
left
the
gang
and
stopped
drinking
and
we
had
long
talks
together
about
his
great
ambition
he
wanted
to
enter
the
fire
department
as
soon
as
he
was
and
i
promised
to
use
my
influence
she
stopped
still
frowning
slightly
what
happened
roger
asked
her
his
girl
took
up
with
another
man
and
joe
has
hot
italian
blood
he
got
drunk
one
night
and
shot
them
both
there
was
another
silence
i
did
what
i
could
she
said
harshly
but
he
had
a
bad
record
behind
him
and
the
young
assistant
district
attorney
had
his
own
record
to
think
of
too
so
joe
got
a
death
sentence
we
appealed
the
case
but
it
did
no
good
he
was
sent
up
the
river
and
is
in
the
death
house
now
and
he
sent
for
me
to
come
his
letter
hinted
he
was
scared
he
wrote
that
his
priest
was
no
good
to
him
so
i
went
up
this
afternoon
joe
goes
to
the
chair
at
six
deborah
went
to
the
sofa
and
sat
down
inertly
roger
remained
motionless
and
a
dull
chill
crept
over
him
so
you
see
my
work
is
personal
he
heard
her
mutter
presently
all
at
once
she
seemed
so
far
away
such
a
stranger
to
him
in
this
life
of
hers
by
george
it
horrible
he
said
i
sorry
you
went
to
see
the
boy
i
glad
was
his
daughter
quick
retort
i
been
getting
much
too
sure
of
myself
of
my
school
i
mean
and
what
it
can
do
i
needed
this
to
bring
me
back
to
the
kind
of
world
we
live
in
what
do
you
mean
he
roughly
asked
i
mean
there
are
schools
and
prisons
and
gallows
and
electric
chairs
and
i
for
schools
they
tried
their
jails
and
gallows
for
whole
black
hideous
centuries
what
good
have
they
done
if
they
given
joe
back
to
the
school
and
me
i
have
had
him
a
fireman
in
a
year
i
know
because
i
studied
him
hard
he
have
fighting
fires
he
would
have
lives
again
she
stopped
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
in
suspense
he
watched
her
angry
struggle
to
regain
control
of
herself
she
sat
bolt
upright
rigid
her
birthmark
showed
a
fiery
red
in
a
few
moments
he
saw
her
relax
but
of
course
she
added
wearily
it
much
more
complex
than
that
a
school
is
nothing
nowadays
just
by
itself
alone
i
mean
it
only
a
part
of
a
city
life
which
for
most
tenement
children
is
either
very
dull
and
hard
or
cheap
and
false
and
overexciting
and
behind
all
that
lie
the
reasons
for
that
and
there
are
so
many
reasons
she
stared
straight
past
her
father
as
though
at
something
far
away
then
she
seemed
to
recall
herself
but
i
talking
too
much
of
my
family
roger
carefully
lit
a
cigar
i
do
think
you
are
my
dear
i
like
to
hear
more
about
it
she
smiled
to
keep
my
mind
off
joe
you
mean
and
mine
too
he
answered
they
had
a
long
talk
that
evening
about
her
hope
of
making
her
school
what
roger
visaged
confusedly
as
a
kind
of
mammoth
home
the
center
of
a
neighborhood
of
one
prodigious
family
at
times
when
the
clock
on
the
mantle
struck
the
hour
loud
and
clear
there
would
fall
a
sudden
silence
as
both
thought
of
what
was
to
happen
at
dawn
but
quickly
roger
would
question
again
and
deborah
would
talk
steadily
on
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
stopped
you
been
good
to
me
dearie
she
said
let
go
to
bed
now
shall
we
very
well
he
answered
he
looked
at
his
daughter
anxiously
she
no
longer
seemed
to
him
mature
he
could
feel
what
heavy
discouragements
what
problems
she
was
facing
in
the
dark
mysterious
tenement
world
which
she
had
chosen
to
make
her
own
and
compared
to
these
she
seemed
a
mere
girl
a
child
groping
its
way
just
making
a
start
and
so
he
added
wistfully
i
wish
i
could
be
of
more
help
to
you
she
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
do
you
know
why
you
are
such
a
help
she
said
it
because
you
have
never
grown
old
because
you
never
allowed
yourself
to
grow
absolutely
certain
about
anything
in
life
a
smile
half
sad
and
half
perplexed
came
on
her
father
heavy
face
you
consider
that
a
strong
point
he
asked
i
do
she
replied
compared
to
being
a
bundle
of
creeds
and
prejudices
oh
i
got
prejudices
enough
yes
she
said
and
so
have
i
but
we
not
even
sure
of
these
days
the
world
has
a
habit
of
crowding
in
her
father
muttered
vaguely
roger
did
not
sleep
that
night
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
away
from
what
was
going
to
happen
at
dawn
yes
the
city
was
crowding
in
upon
this
quiet
house
of
his
dimly
he
could
recollect
in
the
genial
years
of
long
ago
just
glancing
casually
now
and
then
at
some
small
and
unobtrusive
notice
in
his
evening
paper
execution
at
sing
sing
it
had
been
so
remote
to
him
but
here
it
was
smashing
into
his
house
through
the
life
his
own
daughter
was
leading
day
and
night
among
the
poor
each
time
he
thought
of
that
lad
in
a
cell
again
a
chill
crept
over
him
but
savagely
he
shook
it
off
and
by
a
strong
effort
of
his
will
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
things
she
had
told
him
about
her
school
yes
in
her
main
idea
she
was
right
he
had
no
use
for
wild
reforms
but
here
was
something
solid
a
good
education
for
every
child
more
than
once
while
she
had
talked
something
very
deep
in
roger
had
leaped
up
in
swift
response
for
deborah
too
was
a
part
of
himself
he
too
had
had
his
feeling
for
humanity
in
the
large
for
years
he
had
run
a
boys
club
at
a
little
mission
school
in
which
his
wife
had
been
interested
and
on
christmas
eve
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
gathering
up
a
dozen
small
urchins
right
off
the
street
and
taking
them
and
fitting
them
out
with
good
warm
winter
clothing
after
which
he
had
gone
home
to
help
judith
trim
the
christmas
tree
and
fill
their
children
stockings
and
later
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
invariably
he
had
taken
the
christmas
carol
from
its
shelf
and
had
settled
down
with
a
glow
of
almost
luxurious
brotherhood
there
was
sentiment
in
roger
gale
and
as
he
read
of
tiny
tim
his
deepset
eyes
would
glisten
with
tears
and
now
here
was
deborah
fulfilling
a
part
of
him
in
herself
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
but
this
was
going
much
too
far
she
was
letting
herself
be
swallowed
up
completely
by
this
work
of
hers
it
was
all
very
well
for
the
past
ten
years
but
she
was
getting
on
in
age
high
time
to
marry
and
settle
down
again
angrily
he
shook
off
the
thought
of
that
boy
joe
alone
in
a
cell
eyes
fixed
in
animal
terror
upon
the
steel
door
which
would
open
so
soon
the
day
was
slowly
breaking
it
was
the
early
part
of
june
how
fresh
and
lovely
it
must
be
up
there
in
the
big
mountains
with
edith
happy
little
lads
here
it
was
raw
and
garish
weird
some
sparrows
began
quarreling
just
outside
his
window
roger
rose
and
walked
the
room
restlessly
he
went
into
the
hall
the
old
house
appeared
so
strange
in
this
light
as
though
stripped
bare
there
was
something
gone
softly
he
came
to
deborah
door
it
was
open
wide
for
the
night
had
been
warm
and
she
lay
awake
upon
her
bed
with
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
ceiling
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
him
there
he
came
in
and
sat
down
by
her
window
for
a
long
time
neither
made
a
sound
then
the
great
clock
on
the
distant
tower
which
had
been
silent
through
the
night
resumed
its
deep
and
measured
boom
it
struck
six
times
there
was
silence
again
more
and
more
taut
grew
his
muscles
and
suddenly
it
felt
to
him
as
though
deborah
fierce
agony
were
pounding
into
his
very
soul
the
slow
slow
minutes
throbbed
away
at
last
he
rose
and
left
her
there
was
a
cold
sweat
on
his
brow
i
go
down
and
make
her
some
coffee
he
thought
down
in
the
kitchen
it
was
a
relief
to
bang
about
hunting
for
the
utensils
on
picnics
up
in
the
mountains
his
coffee
had
been
famous
he
made
some
now
and
boiled
some
eggs
and
they
breakfasted
in
deborah
room
she
seemed
almost
herself
again
later
while
he
was
dressing
he
saw
her
in
the
doorway
she
was
looking
at
her
father
with
bright
and
grateful
affectionate
eyes
will
you
come
to
school
with
me
i
like
you
to
see
it
deborah
said
very
well
he
answered
gruffly
chapter
x
out
of
the
subway
they
emerged
into
a
noisy
tenement
street
roger
had
known
such
streets
as
this
but
only
in
the
as
picturesque
and
adventurous
ways
in
an
underground
world
he
had
explored
in
search
of
strange
old
glittering
rings
it
was
different
now
gone
were
the
rembrandt
shadows
the
leaping
flare
of
torches
the
dark
surging
masses
of
weird
uncouth
humanity
here
in
garish
daylight
were
poverty
and
ugliness
here
were
heaps
of
refuse
and
heavy
smells
and
clamor
it
disgusted
and
repelled
him
and
he
was
tempted
to
turn
back
but
glancing
at
deborah
by
his
side
he
thought
of
the
night
she
had
been
through
no
he
decided
he
would
go
on
and
see
what
she
was
up
to
here
they
turned
into
a
narrower
street
between
tall
dirty
tenements
and
in
a
twinkling
all
was
changed
for
the
street
as
far
as
he
could
see
was
gay
with
flaunting
colors
torrents
of
bobbing
hats
and
ribbons
frocks
and
blouses
shirts
and
breeches
vivid
reds
and
yellows
and
blues
it
was
deafening
with
joyous
cries
a
shrill
incessant
chatter
chatter
piercing
yells
and
shrieks
of
laughter
children
swarms
of
children
children
of
all
sizes
passed
him
clean
and
dirty
smiling
scowling
hurrying
running
pummeling
grabbing
whirling
each
other
and
till
the
very
air
seemed
quivering
with
wild
spirits
and
new
life
he
heard
deborah
laughing
five
hilarious
small
boys
had
hold
of
her
hands
and
were
marching
in
triumph
waving
their
caps
heigh
there
heigh
there
heigh
heigh
heigh
the
school
was
close
in
front
of
them
an
enormous
building
of
brick
and
tile
wedged
into
a
disordered
mass
of
tenements
shops
and
factories
it
had
been
built
around
a
court
shut
out
from
the
street
by
a
high
steel
fence
they
squeezed
into
the
gateway
through
which
a
shouting
punching
mob
of
urchins
were
now
pushing
in
and
soon
from
a
balcony
above
roger
looked
down
into
the
court
where
out
of
a
wild
chaos
order
was
appearing
boys
to
the
right
and
girls
to
the
left
were
forming
in
long
sinuous
lines
and
three
thousand
faces
were
turned
toward
the
building
in
front
appeared
the
stars
and
stripes
then
suddenly
he
heard
a
crash
from
underneath
the
balcony
and
looking
down
he
saw
a
band
made
up
of
some
thirty
or
forty
boys
their
leader
a
dark
italian
lad
made
a
flourish
a
pass
with
his
baton
and
the
band
broke
into
a
blaring
storm
an
uproarious
booming
march
the
mob
below
fell
into
step
and
line
after
line
in
single
file
the
children
marched
into
their
school
look
up
look
all
around
you
he
heard
deborah
eager
voice
in
his
ear
and
as
he
looked
up
from
the
court
below
he
gave
a
low
cry
of
amazement
in
hundreds
of
windows
all
around
of
sweatshops
tenements
factories
on
tier
upon
tier
of
fire
escapes
and
even
upon
the
roofs
above
silent
watchers
had
appeared
for
this
one
moment
in
the
day
the
whole
congested
neighborhood
had
stopped
its
feverish
labor
and
become
an
amphitheater
with
all
eyes
upon
the
school
and
the
thought
flashed
into
roger
mind
deborah
big
family
he
had
a
strange
confusing
time
in
her
office
in
a
daze
he
sat
and
heard
his
daughter
with
her
two
assistant
principals
her
clerk
and
her
stenographer
plunge
into
the
routine
work
of
the
day
what
kind
of
school
teacher
was
this
she
seemed
more
like
the
manager
of
some
buzzing
factory
messages
kept
coming
constantly
from
children
came
for
punishment
and
on
each
small
human
problem
she
was
passing
judgment
quickly
meanwhile
a
score
of
mothers
most
of
them
italians
with
colored
shawls
upon
their
heads
had
straggled
in
and
taken
seats
and
one
by
one
they
came
to
her
desk
for
these
women
who
had
been
children
in
peasant
huts
in
italy
now
had
children
of
their
own
in
the
great
city
of
new
york
and
they
found
it
very
baffling
how
to
keep
them
in
at
night
how
to
make
them
go
to
the
priest
how
to
feed
and
clothe
them
how
to
live
in
these
tenement
homes
in
this
wild
din
and
chaos
they
wanted
help
and
they
wanted
advice
deborah
spoke
in
italian
but
turning
to
her
father
she
would
translate
from
time
to
time
a
tired
scowling
woman
said
my
boy
wo
obey
me
his
father
is
dead
when
i
slap
him
he
only
jumps
away
i
lock
him
in
and
he
steals
the
key
he
keeps
it
in
his
pocket
he
steals
the
money
that
i
earn
he
says
i
from
the
country
and
a
flabby
anxious
woman
said
my
girl
runs
out
to
dance
halls
sometimes
she
comes
back
at
two
in
the
morning
she
is
fifteen
and
she
ought
to
get
married
but
what
can
i
do
a
nice
steady
man
who
never
dances
comes
sometimes
to
see
her
but
she
makes
faces
and
calls
him
a
fatty
she
dances
before
him
and
pushes
him
out
and
slams
the
door
what
can
i
do
please
come
and
see
our
janitor
and
make
him
fix
our
kitchen
sink
an
angry
little
woman
cried
when
i
try
to
wash
the
dishes
the
water
spouts
all
over
me
and
then
a
plump
rosy
mother
said
in
a
soft
coaxing
voice
i
have
eight
little
children
all
nice
and
clean
when
you
tell
them
to
do
anything
they
always
do
it
quickly
they
smile
at
you
they
are
like
saints
so
could
the
kind
beautiful
teacher
fix
it
up
with
a
newspaper
to
send
them
to
the
country
this
summer
when
it
is
so
hot
the
newspaper
could
send
a
man
and
he
could
take
our
pictures
most
of
us
girls
used
to
be
in
this
school
said
a
bright
looking
jewess
of
eighteen
and
you
taught
us
how
we
should
live
nice
but
how
can
we
live
nice
when
our
shop
is
so
rotten
our
boss
is
trying
to
kiss
the
girls
he
is
trying
to
hug
them
on
the
stairs
and
what
he
pays
us
is
a
joke
and
we
must
work
till
nine
so
will
you
help
us
teacher
and
give
us
a
room
for
our
meetings
here
we
want
to
have
a
union
a
truant
officer
brought
in
two
ragged
frightened
little
chaps
found
on
the
street
during
school
hours
they
had
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
sullenly
one
of
them
gave
an
address
far
up
in
the
bronx
ten
miles
away
they
had
not
been
home
for
a
week
he
said
was
he
lying
what
was
to
be
done
somewhere
in
the
city
their
homes
must
be
discovered
and
the
talk
of
the
truant
officer
made
roger
feel
ramifications
here
which
wound
out
through
the
police
and
the
courts
to
reformatories
distant
cells
he
thought
of
that
electric
chair
and
suddenly
he
felt
oppressed
by
the
heavy
complexity
of
it
all
and
this
was
part
and
parcel
of
his
daughter
daily
work
in
school
still
dazed
disturbed
but
curious
he
sat
and
watched
and
listened
while
the
bewildering
demands
of
deborah
big
family
kept
crowding
in
upon
her
he
went
to
a
few
of
the
and
found
that
reading
and
writing
arithmetic
and
spelling
were
being
taught
in
ways
which
he
had
never
dreamed
of
he
found
a
kindergarten
class
a
carpenter
shop
and
a
printing
shop
a
sewing
class
and
a
cooking
class
in
a
large
model
kitchen
he
watched
the
nurse
in
her
hospital
room
he
went
into
the
dental
clinic
where
a
squad
of
fifty
urchins
were
having
their
teeth
examined
and
out
upon
a
small
side
roof
he
found
a
score
of
small
invalids
in
steamer
chairs
all
fast
asleep
it
was
a
strange
astounding
school
he
heard
deborah
speak
of
a
mothers
club
and
a
neighborhood
association
and
he
learned
of
other
ventures
here
the
school
doctor
the
nurse
and
the
visitor
endlessly
making
experiments
delving
into
the
neighborhood
for
ways
to
meet
its
problems
and
by
the
way
deborah
talked
to
them
he
felt
she
had
gone
before
that
years
ago
by
day
and
night
she
had
been
over
the
ground
alone
and
she
done
all
this
while
she
lived
in
his
house
scattered
memories
out
of
the
past
mere
fragments
she
had
told
him
here
flashed
back
into
his
mind
humorous
little
incidents
of
daily
battles
she
had
waged
in
rotten
old
tenement
buildings
with
rags
and
filth
and
garbage
with
vermin
darkness
and
disease
mingled
with
these
had
been
accounts
of
dances
weddings
and
christenings
and
of
curious
funeral
rites
and
struggling
with
such
dim
memories
of
deborah
in
her
twenties
called
forth
in
his
mind
by
the
picture
of
the
woman
of
thirty
here
roger
grew
still
more
confused
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
it
she
was
still
but
a
pioneer
in
a
jungle
endlessly
groping
and
trying
new
things
how
many
children
are
there
in
the
public
schools
he
asked
about
eight
hundred
thousand
deborah
said
good
lord
he
groaned
and
he
felt
within
him
a
glow
of
indignation
rise
against
these
immigrant
women
for
breeding
so
inconsiderately
with
the
mad
city
growing
so
fast
and
the
people
of
the
tenements
breeding
breeding
breeding
and
packing
the
schools
to
bursting
what
could
any
teacher
be
but
a
mere
cog
in
a
machine
ponderous
impersonal
blind
grinding
out
future
new
yorkers
he
reached
home
limp
and
battered
from
the
storm
of
new
impressions
coming
on
top
of
his
sleepless
night
he
had
thought
of
a
school
as
a
simple
place
filled
with
little
children
mischievous
at
times
perhaps
and
some
with
dirty
faces
but
still
with
minds
and
spirits
clean
unsoiled
as
yet
by
contact
with
the
grim
spirit
of
the
town
he
had
thought
of
childhood
as
something
intimate
and
pure
inside
his
home
his
family
instead
of
that
in
deborah
school
he
had
been
disturbed
and
thrilled
by
the
presence
all
around
him
of
something
wild
barbaric
dark
compounded
of
the
city
streets
of
surging
crowds
of
rushing
feet
of
turmoil
filth
disease
and
death
of
poverty
and
vice
and
crime
but
roger
could
still
hear
that
band
and
behind
its
blaring
crash
and
din
he
had
felt
the
vital
throbbing
of
a
tremendous
joyousness
of
gaiety
fresh
hopes
and
dreams
of
leaping
young
emotions
like
deep
buried
bubbling
springs
bursting
up
resistlessly
to
renew
the
fevered
life
of
the
town
deborah
big
family
children
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
the
vision
hidden
in
those
words
now
opened
wide
before
his
eyes
chapter
xi
she
told
him
the
next
morning
her
night
school
closed
for
the
summer
that
week
i
think
i
should
like
to
see
it
her
father
said
determinedly
she
gave
him
an
affectionate
smile
oh
dearie
have
you
had
enough
i
guess
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
was
his
gruff
rejoinder
though
if
i
ran
a
school
like
yours
i
think
by
night
i
have
schooled
enough
do
most
principals
run
night
schools
too
a
good
many
of
them
do
is
it
taxing
your
strength
he
asked
do
you
have
to
tax
your
strength
his
daughter
replied
good
humoredly
to
really
accomplish
anything
do
you
have
to
risk
yourself
in
order
to
really
live
these
days
suppose
you
come
down
night
we
wo
go
to
the
school
for
i
doubt
if
the
clubs
and
classes
would
interest
you
very
much
i
take
you
through
the
neighborhood
they
went
down
the
following
evening
the
night
was
warm
and
humid
and
through
the
narrow
tenement
streets
there
poured
a
teeming
mass
of
life
people
by
the
thousands
passed
bareheaded
men
in
shirt
sleeves
their
faces
glistening
with
sweat
animal
odors
filled
the
air
the
torches
on
the
pushcarts
threw
flaring
lights
and
shadows
the
peddlers
shouted
hoarsely
the
tradesmen
in
the
booths
and
stalls
joined
in
with
cries
shrill
peals
of
mirth
the
mass
swept
onward
talking
talking
and
its
voice
was
a
guttural
roar
small
boys
and
girls
with
piercing
yells
kept
darting
under
elbows
old
women
dozed
on
doorsteps
babies
screamed
on
every
side
mothers
leaned
out
of
windows
and
by
their
faces
you
could
see
that
they
were
screaming
angrily
for
children
to
come
up
to
bed
but
you
could
not
hear
their
cries
here
around
a
hurdy
gurdy
gravely
danced
some
little
girls
a
tense
young
jew
dark
faced
and
thin
was
shouting
from
a
wagon
that
all
men
and
women
must
be
free
and
own
the
factories
and
mills
a
mob
of
small
boys
clustered
a
camp
fire
they
had
made
on
the
street
were
leaping
wildly
through
the
flames
it
was
a
mammoth
cauldron
here
seething
bubbling
over
with
a
million
foreign
lives
deborah
big
family
she
turned
into
a
doorway
went
down
a
long
dark
passage
and
came
into
a
enclosed
by
greasy
tenement
walls
that
reared
to
a
spot
of
dark
blue
sky
where
a
few
quiet
stars
were
twinkling
down
with
a
feeling
of
repugnance
roger
followed
his
daughter
into
a
tall
rear
building
and
up
a
rickety
flight
of
stairs
on
the
fourth
landing
she
knocked
at
a
door
and
presently
it
was
opened
by
a
stout
young
irish
woman
with
flushed
haggard
features
and
disheveled
hair
oh
good
evening
mrs
berry
good
evening
come
in
was
the
curt
reply
they
entered
a
small
stifling
room
where
were
a
stove
two
kitchen
chairs
and
three
frowzled
beds
in
corners
on
one
of
the
beds
lay
a
baby
asleep
on
another
two
small
restless
boys
sat
up
and
watched
the
visitors
a
sick
man
lay
upon
the
third
and
a
cripple
boy
a
boarder
here
stood
on
his
crutches
watching
them
roger
was
struck
at
once
by
his
face
over
the
broad
cheek
bones
the
sallow
skin
was
tightly
drawn
but
there
was
a
determined
set
to
the
jaws
that
matched
the
boy
shrewd
grayish
eyes
and
his
face
lit
up
in
a
wonderful
smile
hello
miss
deborah
he
said
his
voice
had
a
cheery
quality

and

with
a
quick
jerk
of
his
head

pretty

he
said
roger
looked
at
the
man
on
the
bed
with
his
thin
waxen
features
drawn
the
man
was
gasping
for
each
breath
what
the

whispered
lungs

the
young

harshly

deborah
answered
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
the
baby
whimpered
in
its
sleep
one
child
had
gone
to
his
father
bed
and
was
frowning
at
his
agony
as
though
it
were
a
tiresome
sight

the
woman
sharply

the
woman
swallowed
fiercely

flush
on

deepened
she
scowled
to
keep
back
the
tears

sir
my
boy
said
roger
and
suddenly
he
cleared
his
throat
he
followed
his
daughter
down
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
she
talked
with
the
janitor
then
joined
her
father
in
the
court
i
sorry
i
took
you
up
there
she
said
i
did
know
the
man
was
sick
who
are
they
he
asked
poor
people
she
said
and
roger
flinched
who
is
this
boy
a
neighbor
of
theirs
his
mother
who
was
a
widow
died
about
two
years
ago
he
was
left
alone
and
scared
to
death
lest
he
should
be
away
in
some
big
institution
he
got
berry
to
take
him
in
and
to
earn
his
board
he
began
selling
papers
instead
of
coming
to
our
school
so
our
school
visitor
looked
him
up
since
then
i
have
been
paying
his
board
from
a
fund
i
have
from
friends
uptown
and
so
he
has
finished
his
schooling
he
to
graduate
next
week
he
means
to
be
a
stenographer
how
old
is
he
seventeen
she
replied
how
was
he
crippled
born
that
way
no
when
he
was
a
baby
his
mother
dropped
him
one
saturday
night
when
she
was
drunk
he
has
never
been
able
to
sit
down
he
can
lie
down
or
he
can
stand
he
always
in
pain
it
never
stops
i
learned
that
from
the
doctor
i
took
him
to
see
but
whenever
you
ask
him
how
he
feels
you
get
the
same
answer
always
thank
you
he
a
fighter
is
john
he
looks
it
i
like
to
help
that
boy
all
right
you
can
help
him
deborah
said
you
find
him
quite
a
tonic
a
what
a
tonic
she
repeated
and
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
her
wide
and
sensitive
mouth
deborah
added
slowly
because
though
i
known
many
hungry
boys
johnny
geer
is
the
hungriest
of
them
all
hungry
to
get
on
in
life
to
grow
and
learn
and
get
good
things
get
friends
love
happiness
everything
as
she
spoke
of
this
child
in
her
family
over
her
strong
quiet
face
there
swept
a
fierce
intent
expression
which
struck
roger
rather
cold
what
a
fight
she
was
making
this
daughter
of
his
against
what
overwhelming
odds
but
all
he
said
to
her
was
this
now
let
look
at
something
more
cheerful
my
dear
very
well
she
answered
with
a
smile
we
go
and
see
isadore
freedom
who
he
isadore
freedom
said
deborah
is
the
beginning
of
something
tremendous
he
came
from
russian
poland
and
the
first
american
word
he
learned
over
there
was
so
in
new
york
he
changed
his
name
to
that
very
solemnly
by
due
process
of
law
it
cost
him
seven
dollars
he
had
nine
dollars
at
the
time
isadore
is
a
flame
a
kind
of
a
torch
in
the
wilderness
how
does
the
flame
earn
his
living
at
first
in
a
sweatshop
she
replied
but
he
came
to
my
school
five
nights
a
week
and
at
ten
when
school
was
out
he
went
to
a
little
basement
café
where
he
sat
at
a
corner
table
drank
one
glass
of
russian
tea
and
studied
till
they
closed
at
one
then
he
went
to
his
room
he
told
me
and
used
to
read
himself
to
sleep
he
slept
as
a
rule
four
hours
he
said
he
felt
he
needed
it
now
he
a
librarian
earning
fifteen
dollars
a
week
and
having
all
the
money
he
needs
he
has
put
the
thought
of
it
out
of
his
life
and
is
living
for
education
education
in
freedom
for
isadore
has
studied
his
name
until
he
thinks
he
knows
what
it
means
they
found
him
in
a
small
public
library
on
an
ghetto
street
the
place
had
been
packed
with
people
but
the
clock
had
just
struck
ten
and
the
readers
were
leaving
reluctantly
many
with
books
under
their
arms
at
sight
of
deborah
and
her
father
isadore
leaped
up
from
his
desk
and
came
quickly
to
meet
them
with
outstretched
hands
oh
this
is
splendid
good
evening
he
cried
hardly
more
than
a
boy
perhaps
he
was
short
of
frame
but
large
of
limb
he
had
wide
stooping
shoulders
and
reddish
hollows
in
his
dark
cheeks
yet
there
was
a
springiness
in
his
step
vigor
and
warmth
in
the
grip
of
his
hand
in
the
very
curl
of
his
thick
black
hair
in
his
voice
in
his
enormous
smile
come
he
said
to
roger
when
the
greetings
were
over
you
shall
see
my
library
sir
but
i
want
that
you
shall
not
see
it
alone
while
you
look
you
must
close
for
me
your
eyes
and
see
other
libraries
many
many
all
over
the
world
you
must
see
them
in
big
cities
and
in
very
little
towns
you
must
see
people
millions
there
hungry
hungry
people
now
i
shall
show
you
their
food
and
their
drink
as
he
spoke
he
was
leading
them
proudly
around
in
the
stacks
along
the
walls
he
pointed
out
fiction
poetry
history
books
of
all
the
sciences
they
read
all
all
cried
isadore
look
at
this
darwin
on
my
desk
in
a
year
so
many
have
read
this
book
it
is
a
case
for
the
board
of
health
and
look
at
this
shelf
of
economics
i
place
it
next
to
astronomy
and
i
say
to
these
people
read
about
jobs
and
your
hours
and
wages
yes
you
must
strike
you
must
have
better
lives
but
you
must
read
also
about
the
stars
and
about
the
big
spaces
silent
not
one
single
little
sound
for
many
many
million
years
to
be
free
you
must
grow
as
big
as
that
inside
of
your
head
inside
of
your
soul
it
is
not
enough
to
be
free
of
a
czar
a
kaiser
or
a
sweatshop
boss
what
will
you
do
when
they
are
gone
my
fine
people
how
will
you
run
the
world
you
are
deaf
and
blind
you
must
be
free
to
open
your
own
ears
and
eyes
to
look
into
the
books
and
see
what
is
there
great
thoughts
and
feelings
great
ideas
and
when
you
have
seen
then
you
must
think
you
must
think
it
all
out
every
time
that
is
freedom
he
stopped
abruptly
again
on
his
dark
features
came
a
huge
and
winning
smile
and
with
an
apologetic
shrug
but
i
talk
too
much
of
my
books
he
said
come
shall
we
go
to
my
café
on
a
neighboring
street
a
few
minutes
later
down
a
flight
of
steep
wooden
stairs
they
descended
into
a
little
café
shaped
like
a
tunnel
the
ceiling
low
the
bare
walls
soiled
by
rubbing
elbows
dirty
hands
the
air
blue
and
hot
with
smoke
young
men
and
girls
packed
in
at
small
tables
bent
over
tall
glasses
of
russian
tea
and
gesturing
with
their
cigarettes
declaimed
and
argued
excitedly
quick
joyous
cries
of
greeting
met
isadore
from
every
side
you
see
he
said
gaily
this
is
my
club
here
we
are
like
a
family
he
ordered
tea
of
a
waiter
who
seemed
more
like
a
bosom
friend
and
leaning
eagerly
forward
he
began
to
speak
in
glowing
terms
of
the
men
and
girls
from
sweatshops
who
spent
their
nights
in
these
feasts
of
the
soul
talking
listening
grappling
for
the
power
to
think
with
minds
as
clear
as
the
sun
when
it
rises
he
ardently
cried
there
is
not
a
night
in
this
city
not
one
when
hundreds
do
not
talk
like
this
until
the
breaking
of
the
day
and
then
they
sleep
a
little
joke
for
at
six
they
must
rise
to
their
work
and
that
is
a
force
he
added
not
only
for
those
people
but
a
force
for
you
and
me
do
you
see
when
you
feel
tired
when
all
your
hopes
are
sinking
low
you
think
of
those
people
and
you
say
will
go
to
their
places
and
you
go
you
listen
and
you
watch
their
faces
and
such
fire
makes
you
burn
you
go
home
you
are
happy
you
have
a
new
life
and
perhaps
at
last
you
will
have
a
religion
he
continued
in
fervent
tones
you
see
with
us
jews
and
with
christians
too
the
old
religion
it
is
gone
and
in
its
place
there
is
nothing
strong
and
so
the
young
people
go
all
to
pieces
they
dance
and
they
drink
if
you
go
to
those
dance
halls
you
say
are
crazy
for
dancing
alone
is
not
enough
and
you
say
people
must
have
a
religion
you
ask
can
i
find
a
new
god
and
you
reply
is
no
god
and
then
you
must
be
very
sad
you
know
how
it
is
you
feel
too
free
and
you
feel
scared
and
lonely
you
look
up
at
the
stars
there
are
millions
you
are
only
a
speck
of
dust
on
one
but
then
you
come
to
my
library
and
you
see
those
hungry
people
more
hungry
than
men
have
ever
been
and
you
see
those
books
upon
the
shelves
and
you
know
when
they
come
together
at
last
when
that
power
to
think
as
clear
as
the
sun
comes
into
the
souls
of
those
people
so
hungry
then
we
shall
have
a
new
god
for
the
world
for
there
is
no
end
to
what
they
shall
do
isadore
ended
huskily
roger
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
glanced
into
his
daughter
eyes
and
saw
a
suspicious
brightness
there
isadore
looked
at
her
happily
you
see
he
said
to
roger
when
she
came
here
she
was
tired
half
sick
but
now
she
is
all
filled
with
life
later
on
the
street
outside
when
isadore
had
left
them
deborah
turned
to
her
father
before
we
go
home
there
one
place
more
and
they
went
to
a
building
not
far
away
a
new
structure
twelve
floors
high
which
rose
out
of
the
neighboring
tenements
it
had
been
built
she
told
him
by
a
socialist
daily
paper
a
dull
night
watchman
half
asleep
took
them
in
the
elevator
up
to
the
top
floor
of
the
building
where
in
a
bustling
clanking
loft
the
paper
was
just
going
to
press
deborah
seemed
to
know
one
of
the
foremen
he
smiled
and
nodded
and
led
the
way
through
the
noise
and
bustle
to
a
large
glass
door
at
one
end
this
she
opened
and
stepped
out
upon
a
fire
escape
so
broad
it
was
more
like
a
balcony
and
with
the
noise
of
the
presses
subdued
from
their
high
perch
they
looked
silently
down
all
around
them
for
miles
it
seemed
stretched
dark
uneven
fields
of
roofs
with
the
narrow
east
river
winding
its
way
through
the
midst
of
them
to
the
harbor
below
silvery
dim
and
cool
and
serene
opening
to
the
distant
sea
from
the
bridges
rearing
high
over
the
river
lights
by
thousands
sparkled
down
but
directly
below
the
spot
where
they
stood
was
only
a
dull
hazy
glow
rising
out
of
dark
tenement
streets
where
dimly
they
could
just
make
out
numberless
moving
shadowy
forms
restless
crowds
too
hot
to
sleep
the
roofs
were
covered
everywhere
with
men
and
women
and
children
families
families
families
all
merged
together
in
the
dark
and
from
them
rose
into
the
night
a
ceaseless
murmur
of
voices
laughing
and
joking
quarreling
loving
and
hating
demanding
complaining
and
fighting
and
slaving
and
scheming
for
bread
and
the
means
of
stark
existence
but
among
these
struggling
multitudes
confusedly
did
roger
feel
the
brighter
presence
here
and
there
of
more
aspiring
figures
small
groups
in
glaring
stilling
rooms
down
there
beneath
the
murky
dark
young
people
fiercely
arguing
groping
blindly
for
new
gods
and
all
these
voices
to
his
ears
merged
into
one
deep
thrilling
hum
these
lights
into
one
quivering
glow
that
went
up
toward
the
silent
stars
and
there
came
to
him
a
feeling
which
he
had
often
had
before
in
many
different
places
that
he
himself
was
a
part
of
all
this
the
great
blind
wistful
soul
of
mankind
which
had
been
here
before
he
was
born
and
would
be
here
when
he
was
dead
still
groping
yearning
struggling
upward
on
and
on
to
something
distant
as
the
sun
and
still
would
he
be
a
part
of
it
all
through
the
eager
lives
of
his
children
he
turned
and
looked
at
deborah
and
caught
the
light
that
was
in
her
eyes
chapter
xii
roger
awoke
the
next
morning
feeling
sore
and
weary
and
later
in
his
office
it
was
hard
to
keep
his
mind
on
his
work
he
thought
of
young
isadore
freedom
he
was
glad
he
had
met
that
boy
and
so
he
felt
toward
deborah
whole
terrific
family
confused
and
deafening
as
it
was
there
was
something
inspiring
in
it
all
but
god
save
him
from
many
such
evenings
for
half
his
life
roger
had
been
a
collector
not
only
of
rings
but
of
people
too
of
curious
personalities
these
human
bits
these
memories
he
had
picked
up
as
he
lived
along
and
had
taken
them
with
him
and
made
them
his
own
had
trimmed
and
polished
every
one
until
its
rough
unpleasant
edges
were
all
nicely
smoothed
away
and
it
glittered
and
shone
like
the
gem
that
it
was
for
roger
was
an
idealist
and
so
he
would
have
liked
to
do
here
what
a
gem
could
be
made
of
isadore
with
a
little
careful
polishing
but
deborah
way
was
different
she
stayed
in
life
lived
in
it
close
with
its
sharp
edges
bristling
in
this
there
was
something
splendid
but
there
was
something
tragic
too
it
was
all
very
well
for
that
young
jew
to
burn
himself
up
with
his
talk
about
freedom
his
feverish
searching
for
new
gods
in
five
years
roger
told
himself
isadore
freedom
will
either
tone
down
or
go
stark
mad
but
quite
probably
he
would
tone
down
for
he
was
only
a
youngster
these
were
isadore
wild
oats
but
this
was
no
longer
deborah
youth
she
had
been
at
this
job
ten
years
and
she
had
gone
mad
she
had
kept
herself
sane
she
had
many
sides
her
father
knew
he
knew
her
in
the
mountains
or
bustling
about
at
home
getting
ready
for
laura
wedding
or
packing
edith
children
off
for
their
summer
up
at
the
farm
but
did
that
make
it
any
easier
no
to
let
yourself
go
was
easy
but
to
keep
hold
of
yourself
was
hard
it
meant
wear
and
tear
on
a
woman
this
constant
straining
effort
to
keep
her
balance
and
see
life
whole
well
it
will
break
her
down
that
all
and
i
do
propose
to
allow
it
he
thought
she
got
to
rest
this
summer
and
go
easier
next
fall
but
how
could
he
accomplish
it
as
he
thought
about
her
school
with
its
long
and
generous
arms
reaching
upon
every
side
out
into
the
tenements
the
prospect
was
bewildering
he
searched
for
something
definite
what
could
he
do
to
prove
to
his
daughter
his
real
interest
in
her
work
presently
he
remembered
johnny
geer
the
cripple
boy
whom
he
had
liked
and
at
once
he
began
to
feel
himself
back
again
upon
known
ground
instead
of
millions
here
was
one
one
plucky
lad
who
needed
help
all
right
by
george
he
should
have
it
and
roger
told
his
daughter
he
would
be
glad
to
pay
the
expense
of
sending
john
away
for
the
summer
and
that
in
the
autumn
perhaps
he
would
take
the
lad
into
his
office
that
good
of
you
dearie
deborah
said
it
was
her
only
comment
but
from
the
look
she
gave
him
roger
felt
he
was
getting
on
one
evening
not
long
afterwards
as
they
sat
together
at
dinner
she
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
and
said
in
a
breathless
voice
it
rather
close
in
here
is
it
i
think
i
go
outside
for
a
while
roger
jumped
up
look
here
my
child
you
faint
he
cried
no
no
it
nothing
just
the
heat
she
swayed
and
reeled
pitched
suddenly
forward
father
quick
and
roger
caught
her
in
his
arms
he
called
to
the
maid
and
with
her
help
he
carried
deborah
up
to
her
bed
there
she
shuddered
violently
and
beads
of
sweat
broke
out
on
her
brow
her
breath
came
hard
through
chattering
teeth
it
so
silly
she
said
fiercely
but
as
moments
passed
the
chill
grew
worse
her
whole
body
seemed
to
be
shaking
and
as
roger
was
rubbing
one
of
her
arms
she
said
something
to
him
sharply
in
a
voice
so
thick
he
could
not
understand
what
is
it
he
asked
i
ca
feel
anything
what
do
you
mean
in
my
arm
where
you
rubbing
i
ca
feel
your
hand
you
better
have
a
doctor
telephone
allan
allan
baird
he
knows
about
this
she
muttered
and
roger
ran
down
to
the
telephone
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
all
right
gale
came
baird
gruff
bass
steady
and
slow
i
think
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
and
i
would
worry
if
i
were
you
i
be
there
in
about
ten
minutes
and
it
was
hardly
more
than
that
when
he
came
into
deborah
room
a
moment
he
looked
down
at
her
again
he
said
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
nodded
and
smiled
quickly
through
set
teeth
baird
carefully
examined
her
and
then
turned
to
roger
now
i
guess
you
better
go
out
you
stay
he
added
to
sarah
the
maid
i
may
need
you
here
awhile
about
an
hour
later
he
came
down
to
roger
study
she
safe
enough
now
i
guess
he
said
i
telephoned
for
a
nurse
for
her
and
she
have
to
stay
in
bed
a
few
days
what
the
trouble
acute
indigestion
you
do
say
exclaimed
roger
brightly
with
a
rush
of
deep
relief
baird
gave
him
a
dry
quizzical
smile
people
have
died
of
that
he
remarked
in
less
than
an
hour
we
caught
your
daughter
just
in
time
may
i
stay
a
few
moments
glad
to
have
you
smoke
a
cigar
thanks
i
will
as
baird
reached
out
for
the
proffered
cigar
roger
suddenly
noticed
his
hand
long
and
muscular
finely
shaped
it
seemed
to
speak
of
strength
and
skill
and
an
immense
vitality
baird
settled
himself
in
his
chair
i
want
to
talk
about
her
he
said
this
little
attack
is
only
a
symptom
it
comes
from
nerves
she
just
about
ready
for
a
smash
she
had
slighter
attacks
of
this
kind
before
i
never
knew
it
roger
said
no
i
do
suppose
you
did
your
daughter
has
a
habit
of
keeping
things
like
this
to
herself
she
came
to
me
and
i
warned
her
but
she
wanted
to
finish
out
her
year
do
you
know
anything
about
her
school
work
yes
i
was
with
her
there
this
week
what
did
she
show
you
baird
inquired
roger
tried
to
tell
him
no
that
not
what
i
after
he
said
that
just
one
of
her
usual
evenings
for
a
moment
he
smoked
in
silence
i
hunting
now
for
something
else
for
some
unusual
nervous
shock
which
she
appears
to
me
to
have
had
she
has
and
roger
told
him
of
her
visit
up
to
sing
sing
baird
lean
muscular
right
hand
slowly
tightened
on
his
chair
that
a
tough
family
of
hers
he
remarked
yes
said
roger
determinedly
and
she
got
to
give
it
up
you
mean
she
ought
to
but
she
wo
she
got
to
be
made
to
roger
growled
this
summer
at
least
baird
shook
his
head
you
forget
her
fresh
air
work
he
replied
she
has
three
thousand
children
on
her
mind
the
city
will
be
like
a
furnace
of
course
and
the
children
must
be
sent
to
camps
if
you
do
see
the
necessity
go
and
talk
to
her
and
then
you
will
but
you
can
forbid
it
ca
you
no
can
you
i
can
try
snapped
roger
let
try
what
possible
said
baird
let
try
to
keep
her
in
bed
three
days
sounds
modest
roger
grunted
and
a
glimmer
of
amusement
came
into
baird
impassive
eyes
try
it
he
drawled
by
night
she
ask
for
her
stenographer
she
make
you
think
she
is
out
of
the
woods
but
she
wo
be
please
remember
that
a
few
years
more
he
added
and
she
have
used
up
her
vitality
she
be
an
old
woman
at
it
got
to
be
stopped
cried
roger
but
how
came
the
low
sharp
retort
you
got
to
know
her
trouble
first
and
her
trouble
is
deep
it
motherhood
on
a
scale
which
has
never
been
tried
before
for
thousands
of
children
all
of
whom
are
living
in
a
kind
of
hell
i
know
your
daughter
pretty
well
do
make
the
mistake
of
mixing
her
up
with
the
teacher
it
is
what
those
children
learn
it
how
they
live
that
interests
her
and
how
they
are
all
growing
up
i
say
she
a
mother
in
spirit
but
her
body
has
never
borne
a
child
and
that
makes
it
worse
because
it
makes
her
more
intense
it
natural
you
see
a
little
later
he
rose
to
go
by
the
way
he
said
at
the
door
there
something
i
meant
to
tell
her
upstairs
about
a
poor
devil
she
has
on
her
mind
a
chap
named
berry
dying
lungs
she
asked
me
to
go
and
see
him
yes
i
found
it
was
only
a
matter
of
days
the
tragic
pity
in
baird
quiet
voice
was
so
deep
as
barely
to
be
heard
so
i
shot
him
full
of
morphine
he
wo
wake
up
please
tell
her
that
tall
ungainly
motionless
he
loomed
there
in
the
doorway
with
a
little
shrug
and
a
smile
he
turned
and
went
slowly
out
of
the
house
chapter
xiii
deborah
recovery
was
rapid
and
determined
the
next
night
she
was
sitting
up
and
making
light
of
her
illness
on
the
third
day
she
dismissed
her
nurse
and
when
her
father
came
home
from
his
office
he
found
gathered
about
her
bed
not
only
her
stenographer
but
both
her
assistant
principals
he
frowned
severely
and
went
to
his
room
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
them
leave
presently
she
called
to
him
and
he
came
to
her
bedside
she
was
lying
back
on
the
pillow
with
rather
a
guilty
expression
up
to
your
old
antics
eh
he
remarked
exactly
it
could
be
helped
you
see
it
the
last
week
of
our
school
year
and
there
are
so
many
little
things
that
have
to
be
attended
to
simply
now
or
never
humph
was
roger
comment
it
now
or
never
with
you
he
thought
he
went
down
to
his
dinner
and
when
he
came
back
he
found
her
exhausted
in
the
dim
soft
light
of
her
room
her
face
looked
flushed
and
feverish
and
vaguely
he
felt
she
was
in
a
mood
where
she
might
listen
to
reason
he
felt
her
hot
dry
hand
on
his
her
eyes
were
closed
she
was
smiling
tell
me
the
news
from
the
mountains
she
said
and
he
gave
her
the
gossip
of
the
farm
in
a
letter
he
had
had
from
george
it
told
of
a
picnic
supper
the
first
one
of
the
season
they
had
had
it
in
the
usual
place
down
by
the
dam
on
the
river
with
a
bonfire
a
perfect
peach
down
by
the
big
yellow
rock
the
one
you
call
the
elephant
as
roger
read
the
letter
he
could
feel
his
daughter
listening
vividly
picturing
to
herself
the
great
dark
boulders
by
the
creek
the
shadowy
firs
the
stars
above
and
the
cool
fresh
tang
of
the
mountain
night
after
this
little
sickness
of
yours
and
that
harum
scarum
wedding
he
said
i
feel
we
both
entitled
to
a
good
long
rest
in
mountain
air
we
have
it
too
she
murmured
with
edith
little
youngsters
they
all
the
medicine
you
need
he
paused
for
a
moment
hesitating
but
it
was
now
or
never
the
only
trouble
with
you
he
said
is
that
you
let
yourself
be
caught
by
the
same
disease
which
has
its
grip
upon
this
whole
infernal
town
you
like
everyone
else
you
tackling
about
forty
times
what
you
can
do
actually
trying
not
only
to
teach
but
to
bring
all
up
as
your
own
three
thousand
tenement
children
and
this
is
where
it
gets
you
again
he
halted
frowning
what
next
go
on
dear
please
said
deborah
in
demure
and
even
tones
this
is
very
interesting
now
then
he
continued
in
this
matter
of
your
school
i
would
ask
you
to
give
it
up
i
already
seen
too
much
of
it
but
so
long
as
got
it
nicely
started
why
not
give
somebody
else
a
chance
one
of
those
assistants
of
yours
for
example
capable
young
women
both
you
could
stand
right
behind
with
help
and
advice
not
yet
was
deborah
soft
reply
she
had
turned
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
was
looking
at
him
affectionately
why
not
he
demanded
because
it
not
nicely
started
at
all
there
nothing
brilliant
about
me
dear
i
a
plodder
feeling
my
way
along
and
what
i
have
done
in
the
last
ten
years
is
just
coming
to
a
stage
at
last
where
i
can
really
see
a
chance
to
make
it
count
for
something
when
i
feel
i
done
that
say
in
five
years
more
those
five
years
said
her
father
may
cost
you
a
very
heavy
price
as
deborah
faced
his
troubled
regard
her
own
grew
quickly
serious
i
be
willing
to
pay
the
price
she
replied
but
why
he
asked
with
impatience
why
pay
when
you
do
have
to
why
not
by
taking
one
year
off
get
strength
for
twenty
years
work
later
on
you
be
a
different
woman
yes
i
think
i
should
be
i
never
be
the
same
again
you
do
quite
understand
you
see
this
work
of
mine
with
children
well
it
like
edith
having
a
baby
you
have
to
do
it
while
you
young
that
works
both
ways
her
father
growled
what
do
you
mean
he
hesitated
do
you
want
any
children
of
your
own
again
she
turned
her
eyes
toward
his
then
closed
them
and
lay
perfectly
still
now
i
done
it
he
thought
anxiously
she
reached
over
and
took
his
hand
let
talk
of
our
summer
vacation
she
said
a
little
while
later
she
fell
asleep
downstairs
he
soon
grew
restless
and
after
a
time
he
went
out
for
a
walk
but
he
felt
tired
and
oppressed
and
as
he
had
often
done
of
late
he
entered
a
little
movie
nearby
where
gradually
the
pictures
continually
flashing
out
of
the
dark
drove
the
worries
from
his
mind
for
a
half
an
hour
they
held
his
gaze
then
he
fell
into
a
doze
he
was
roused
by
a
roar
of
laughter
and
straightening
up
in
his
seat
with
a
jerk
he
looked
angrily
around
something
broadly
comic
had
been
flashed
upon
the
screen
and
men
and
women
and
children
italians
jews
and
irish
jammed
in
close
about
him
a
dirty
and
perspiring
mass
had
burst
into
a
terrific
guffaw
now
they
were
suddenly
tense
again
and
watching
the
screen
in
absorbed
suspense
while
the
crude
passions
within
themselves
were
played
upon
in
the
glamorous
dark
and
roger
scanned
their
faces
one
moment
smiling
all
together
as
though
some
god
had
pulled
a
string
then
mawkish
sentimental
soft
then
suddenly
scowling
twitching
with
long
rows
of
animal
eyes
but
eager
eager
all
the
time
hungry
people
yes
indeed
hungry
for
all
the
good
things
in
the
town
and
for
as
many
bad
things
too
on
one
who
tried
to
feed
this
mob
there
was
no
end
to
their
demands
what
was
one
woman
life
to
them
deborah
big
family
edith
came
to
the
house
one
afternoon
and
she
was
in
deborah
room
when
her
father
returned
from
his
office
her
convalescence
over
at
last
she
was
leaving
for
the
mountains
do
learn
your
lesson
deborah
dear
she
urged
upon
her
sister
let
sarah
pack
your
trunk
at
once
and
come
up
with
me
on
saturday
night
i
ca
get
off
for
two
weeks
yet
why
ca
you
edith
demanded
and
when
deborah
spoke
of
fresh
air
camps
and
baby
farms
and
other
work
edith
impatience
only
grew
you
have
to
leave
it
to
somebody
else
you
simply
in
no
condition
she
cried
impossible
said
deborah
edith
gave
a
quick
sigh
of
exasperation
is
it
enough
she
asked
to
have
worked
your
nerves
to
a
frazzle
already
why
ca
you
be
sensible
you
got
to
think
of
yourself
a
little
you
like
me
to
marry
would
you
dear
her
sister
put
in
wearily
yes
i
should
while
there
is
still
time
just
now
you
look
far
from
it
it
exactly
as
allan
was
saying
if
you
keep
on
as
you
going
you
be
an
old
woman
at
thank
you
said
deborah
sharply
two
spots
of
color
leaped
in
her
checks
you
better
leave
me
edith
i
come
up
to
the
mountains
as
soon
as
i
can
and
i
try
not
to
look
any
more
like
a
hag
than
i
have
to
roger
followed
edith
out
of
the
room
that
last
shot
of
mine
struck
home
she
declared
to
him
in
triumph
i
would
have
done
it
her
father
said
i
gave
you
that
remark
of
baird
in
strict
confidence
edith
now
father
was
her
retort
suppose
you
leave
this
matter
to
me
i
know
just
what
i
doing
well
he
reflected
uneasily
after
she
had
left
him
here
more
trouble
in
the
family
if
edith
is
careful
she
make
a
fine
mess
of
this
whole
affair
after
dinner
he
went
up
to
deborah
room
but
through
the
open
doorway
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
daughter
which
made
him
instinctively
draw
back
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
bed
sternly
she
was
eyeing
herself
in
a
small
mirror
in
her
hand
her
father
chuckled
noiselessly
a
moment
later
when
he
went
in
the
glass
had
disappeared
from
view
soon
afterwards
baird
himself
arrived
and
as
they
heard
him
coming
upstairs
roger
saw
his
daughter
frown
but
she
continued
talking
hello
allan
she
said
with
indifference
i
feeling
much
better
this
evening
are
you
good
he
answered
and
he
started
to
pull
up
an
easy
chair
i
was
hoping
i
could
stay
awhile
i
been
having
one
of
those
long
mean
days
i
a
little
rather
you
would
deborah
put
in
softly
allan
turned
to
her
in
surprise
i
did
sleep
last
night
she
murmured
and
i
feel
so
drowsy
there
was
a
little
silence
and
i
really
do
think
there
any
need
of
your
dropping
in
she
added
i
so
much
better
honestly
baird
looked
at
her
a
moment
right
o
he
answered
slowly
i
call
up
night
roger
followed
him
downstairs
come
into
my
den
and
smoke
a
cigar
he
proposed
in
hearty
ringing
tones
allan
thanked
him
and
came
in
but
the
puzzled
expression
was
still
on
his
face
and
through
the
first
moments
of
their
talk
he
was
very
roger
feeling
of
guilt
increased
and
he
cursed
himself
for
a
meddlesome
fool
look
here
baird
he
blurted
out
there
something
i
think
you
ought
to
know
allan
slightly
turned
his
head
and
roger
reddened
a
little
the
worst
thing
about
living
in
a
house
chock
full
of
meddling
women
is
that
you
get
to
be
one
yourself
he
growled
and
the
fact
is
he
cleared
his
throat
i
put
my
foot
in
it
baird
he
said
i
was
fool
enough
the
other
day
to
quote
you
to
edith
to
what
effect
that
if
deborah
keeps
on
like
this
she
be
an
old
woman
at
allan
sat
up
in
his
chair
was
edith
here
this
afternoon
she
was
said
roger
say
no
more
baird
had
a
wide
likable
generous
mouth
which
wrinkled
easily
into
a
smile
he
leaned
back
now
and
enjoyed
himself
he
puffed
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
looked
over
at
roger
and
chuckled
aloud
and
roger
chuckled
with
relief
what
a
decent
chap
he
is
he
thought
i
sorry
of
course
he
said
to
baird
i
thought
of
trying
to
explain
do
said
allan
leave
it
alone
it
wo
do
deborah
any
harm
may
even
do
her
a
little
good
after
all
i
her
physician
are
you
roger
asked
with
a
twinkle
i
thought
upstairs
you
were
dismissed
oh
no
i
not
was
the
calm
reply
and
the
two
men
went
on
smoking
roger
liking
for
baird
was
growing
fast
they
had
had
several
little
talks
during
deborah
illness
and
roger
was
learning
more
of
the
man
raised
on
a
big
cattle
ranch
that
his
father
had
owned
in
new
mexico
riding
broncos
on
the
plains
had
given
him
his
abounding
health
of
body
nerve
and
spirit
his
steadiness
and
sanity
in
all
this
feverish
city
life
are
you
riding
these
days
he
inquired
no
said
roger
the
park
is
too
hot
and
they
do
sprinkle
the
path
as
they
should
i
had
my
cob
sent
up
to
the
mountains
by
the
way
he
added
cordially
you
must
come
up
there
and
ride
with
me
thanks
i
like
to
allan
said
and
with
a
little
inner
smile
he
added
dryly
to
himself
he
getting
ready
to
meddle
again
but
whatever
amusement
baird
had
in
this
thought
was
concealed
behind
his
sober
gray
eyes
soon
after
that
he
took
his
leave
now
then
roger
reflected
with
a
little
glow
of
expectancy
if
edith
will
only
leave
me
alone
she
may
find
i
smarter
then
she
thinks
one
evening
in
the
following
week
after
edith
had
left
town
roger
had
bruce
to
dine
at
his
club
a
pleasant
old
building
on
madison
square
where
comfortably
all
by
themselves
they
could
discuss
baird
chances
baird
and
i
have
been
chums
said
bruce
ever
since
we
were
in
college
take
it
from
me
i
know
his
brand
and
he
is
the
kind
to
be
pushed
who
wants
to
push
him
roger
demanded
with
a
sudden
guilty
twinge
edith
does
bruce
answered
and
i
tell
you
that
wo
do
with
baird
he
has
his
mind
set
on
deborah
sure
he
been
setting
it
harder
and
harder
for
months
and
he
knows
it
and
so
does
she
but
they
both
the
kind
of
people
who
do
like
interference
they
got
to
get
to
it
by
themselves
edith
must
keep
out
of
the
way
she
must
take
it
on
herself
to
ask
him
up
to
the
mountains
roger
gave
a
little
start
if
she
does
there
be
trouble
with
deborah
roger
smoked
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
sagely
nodded
his
head
that
so
he
murmured
thoughtfully
yes
my
boy
i
guess
you
right
bruce
lifted
his
mint
julep
god
but
it
hot
in
here
how
about
taking
a
spin
up
the
river
delighted
replied
his
and
a
half
hour
later
in
bruce
new
car
which
was
the
pride
and
joy
of
his
life
they
were
far
up
the
river
on
a
long
level
stretch
of
road
bruce
let
her
out
to
show
what
she
could
do
and
roger
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
and
his
eye
upon
the
speedometer
saw
it
creep
to
almost
as
good
as
a
horse
remarked
bruce
when
the
car
had
slowed
a
little
almost
said
roger
but
not
quite
it
well
it
dissipation
and
a
horse
is
life
was
the
grave
reply
you
have
a
crash
some
day
my
boy
if
you
go
on
at
your
present
speed
it
gets
me
worried
sometimes
you
see
you
a
family
man
i
am
and
i
glad
of
it
edith
and
the
kiddies
suit
me
right
down
to
the
ground
i
crazy
about
you
know
that
but
a
chap
with
a
job
like
mine
bruce
continued
pleadingly
as
he
drove
his
car
rushing
around
a
curve
needs
a
little
dissipation
too
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
means
to
me
when
i
kept
late
at
the
office
to
have
this
car
for
the
run
up
home
lower
broadway
empty
then
and
i
know
the
cops
i
swing
around
through
washington
square
and
the
avenue
looks
clear
for
miles
nothing
but
two
long
rows
of
lights
to
the
big
hump
at
murray
hill
it
the
time
between
crowds
say
about
ten
and
i
know
the
cops
that
all
right
said
roger
no
one
was
more
delighted
than
i
when
you
got
this
car
you
deserve
it
it
the
that
i
was
speaking
of
you
got
it
going
at
such
a
speed
only
way
on
earth
to
get
on
to
get
what
i
want
for
my
family
yes
yes
i
know
muttered
roger
vaguely
bruce
began
talking
of
his
work
for
the
steel
construction
concern
downtown
take
it
from
me
he
declared
at
the
end
this
town
has
only
just
begun
has
eh
roger
grunted
are
the
buildings
high
enough
my
god
i
wish
they
were
twenty
times
higher
bruce
rejoined
but
they
wo
be
we
stopped
going
up
we
done
pretty
well
in
the
air
and
now
we
going
underground
and
when
we
get
through
this
old
rock
of
manhattan
will
be
such
a
network
of
tunnels
there
be
a
hole
waiting
at
every
corner
to
take
you
wherever
you
want
to
go
speed
we
do
even
know
what
it
means
and
again
bruce
let
her
out
a
bit
it
was
a
bit
roger
grabbed
his
hat
with
one
hand
and
the
side
of
the
car
with
the
other
they
look
back
on
a
mile
a
minute
said
bruce
as
we
look
back
on
stage
coach
days
and
in
the
rush
hour
there
be
a
rush
that
make
you
think
of
pneumatic
tubes
not
a
sound
nor
a
quiver
pure
speed
shooting
people
home
at
night
at
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
an
hour
the
city
will
be
as
big
as
that
and
there
wo
be
any
accidents
and
there
wo
be
any
smoke
instead
of
coal
they
use
the
sun
and
my
god
man
the
boulevards
and
parks
and
places
for
the
kids
the
way
they
use
the
river
and
the
ocean
and
the
sound
the
catskills
will
be
central
park
sounds
funny
do
it
but
it
true
i
studied
it
out
from
a
to
z
this
town
is
choking
itself
to
death
simply
because
we
so
damn
slow
we
do
know
how
to
spread
ourselves
all
this
city
needs
is
speed
bruce
said
roger
anxiously
just
go
a
bit
easy
on
that
gas
the
fact
is
it
was
a
great
mistake
for
me
to
eat
those
crabs
bruce
slowed
down
compassionately
and
soon
they
turned
and
started
home
and
as
they
drew
near
the
glow
of
the
town
other
streets
and
boulevards
poured
more
motors
into
the
line
until
at
last
they
were
rushing
along
amid
a
perfect
bedlam
made
up
of
honks
and
shrieks
of
horns
the
air
grew
hot
and
acrid
and
looking
back
through
the
bluish
haze
of
smoke
and
dust
behind
him
roger
could
see
hundreds
of
huge
angry
motor
eyes
crowding
and
jamming
closer
pell
mell
at
a
pace
which
barely
slackened
they
sped
on
a
wild
uproarious
crew
and
swept
into
the
city
roger
barely
slept
that
night
he
felt
the
city
clamoring
down
into
his
very
soul
speed
he
muttered
viciously
speed
speed
we
need
more
speed
the
words
beat
in
like
a
savage
refrain
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
impatience
he
got
up
in
his
nightshirt
and
walked
about
it
was
good
to
feel
his
way
in
the
dark
in
this
cool
silent
house
which
he
knew
so
well
soon
his
nerves
felt
quieter
he
went
back
to
his
bed
and
lay
there
inert
how
good
it
would
be
to
get
up
to
the
farm
the
next
saturday
evening
with
deborah
he
started
for
the
mountains
and
bruce
came
down
to
see
them
off
remember
son
said
roger
as
the
two
walked
on
the
platform
come
up
this
year
for
a
month
my
boy
you
need
it
the
train
was
about
to
start
oh
i
be
all
right
was
the
answer
my
friend
the
judge
who
has
hay
fever
tells
me
he
has
found
a
cure
damn
his
cure
you
come
to
us
hold
on
a
minute
live
and
learn
the
judge
is
quite
excited
about
it

bugs
he
says
a
billion
after
every
meal
they
come
in
tall
blue
bottles
we
going
to
dine
together
next
week
and
drink
till
we
all
lit
up
oh
we
going
to
have
a
hell
of
a
time
wife
left
town
on
tuesday
bruce
said
roger
sternly
as
the
train
began
to
move
leave
bugs
alone
and
come
up
and
breathe
and
quit
smoking
so
many
cigarettes
he
stepped
on
the
car
remember
son
a
solid
month
bruce
nodded
as
the
train
moved
out
good
luck
fine
summer
my
love
to
the
wife
and
the
kiddies
and
bruce
dark
tense
smiling
face
was
left
behind
roger
went
back
into
the
smoker
now
for
the
mountains
he
thought
thank
god
chapter
xiv
a
few
hours
later
roger
awakened
his
lower
berth
was
still
pitch
dark
the
train
had
stopped
and
he
had
been
roused
by
a
voice
outside
his
window
rough
and
slow
and
nasal
the
leisurely
drawl
of
a
mountaineer
it
came
like
balm
to
roger
ears
he
raised
the
curtain
and
looked
out
a
train
hand
with
a
lantern
was
listening
to
a
dairy
man
a
tall
young
giant
in
top
boots
high
overhead
loomed
a
shadowy
mountain
and
over
its
rim
came
the
glow
of
the
dawn
with
a
violent
lurch
the
train
moved
on
and
roger
lying
back
on
his
pillow
looked
up
at
the
misty
mountain
sides
all
mottled
in
the
strange
blue
light
with
patches
of
firs
and
birches
and
pines
in
the
narrow
valley
up
which
the
train
was
thundering
were
small
herds
of
grazing
cattle
a
lonely
farmhouse
here
and
there
from
one
a
light
was
twinkling
and
the
city
with
its
heat
and
noise
its
nervous
throb
its
bedlam
nights
all
dropped
like
a
fever
from
his
soul
now
close
by
the
railroad
track
through
a
shallow
rocky
gorge
a
small
river
roared
and
foamed
its
cool
breath
came
up
to
his
nostrils
and
gratefully
he
breathed
it
in
for
this
was
the
gale
river
named
after
one
of
his
forefathers
and
in
his
mind
eye
he
followed
the
stream
back
up
its
course
to
the
little
station
where
he
and
deborah
were
to
get
off
there
the
narrowing
river
bed
turned
and
wound
up
through
a
cleft
in
the
hills
to
the
homestead
several
miles
away
on
the
dark
forest
road
beside
it
he
pictured
george
his
grandson
at
this
moment
driving
down
to
meet
them
in
a
mountain
wagon
with
one
of
the
two
hired
men
a
lantern
swinging
under
the
wheels
what
an
adventure
for
young
george
presently
he
heard
deborah
stirring
in
the
berth
next
to
his
own
at
the
station
george
was
there
and
from
a
thermos
bottle
which
edith
had
filled
the
night
before
he
poured
coffee
piping
hot
which
steamed
in
the
keen
frosty
air
oh
how
good
cried
deborah
how
thoughtful
of
your
mother
george
how
is
she
dear
oh
she
all
right
aunt
deborah
his
blunt
freckled
features
flushed
from
his
drive
george
stood
beaming
on
them
both
he
appeared
if
anything
tougher
and
scrawnier
than
before
everything
all
right
he
said
there
ai
a
sick
animal
on
the
whole
farm
as
roger
sipped
his
coffee
he
was
having
a
look
at
the
horses
one
of
them
was
william
his
cob
do
you
see
it
inquired
his
grandson
what
the
boil
george
answered
proudly
on
william
rump
there
it
is
on
the
nigh
side
gee
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
it
last
week
it
was
a
whale
of
a
boil
said
george
but
we
poulticed
him
me
and
dave
did
and
now
the
swelling
nearly
gone
you
can
ride
him
if
you
like
luxuriously
roger
lit
a
cigar
and
climbed
to
the
front
seat
with
george
up
the
steep
and
crooked
road
the
stout
horses
tugged
their
way
and
the
wagon
creaked
and
the
gale
river
here
only
a
brook
came
gurgling
dashing
to
meet
them
down
from
the
mountains
from
the
farm
from
roger
youth
to
welcome
him
home
and
the
sun
was
flashing
through
the
pines
as
they
drew
near
the
farmhouse
through
a
grove
of
sugar
maples
he
heard
shrill
cries
of
there
they
come
and
he
glimpsed
the
flying
figures
of
brothers
bob
and
tad
george
whipped
up
the
horses
the
wagon
gained
upon
the
boys
and
reached
the
house
but
a
few
rods
behind
the
little
runners
edith
was
waiting
by
the
door
fresh
and
smiling
blooming
with
health
how
well
this
suited
her
roger
thought
amid
a
gay
chorus
of
greetings
he
climbed
down
heavily
out
of
the
wagon
looked
about
him
and
drew
a
deep
breath
the
long
lazy
days
on
the
farm
had
begun
from
the
mountain
side
the
farm
looked
down
on
a
wide
sweeping
valley
of
woods
and
fields
the
old
house
straggled
along
the
road
with
addition
after
addition
built
on
through
generations
by
many
men
and
women
here
lay
the
history
unread
of
the
family
of
roger
gale
inside
there
were
steps
up
and
down
from
one
part
to
another
queer
crooks
in
narrow
passageways
the
lower
end
was
attached
to
the
woodshed
and
the
woodshed
to
the
barn
above
the
house
a
pasture
dotted
with
gray
boulders
extended
up
to
a
wood
of
firs
and
out
of
this
wood
the
small
river
which
bore
the
name
of
the
family
came
rushing
down
the
field
in
a
gully
went
under
the
road
swept
around
to
the
right
and
along
the
edge
of
a
birch
copse
just
below
the
house
the
little
stream
grew
quieter
there
and
widened
into
a
mill
pond
at
the
lower
end
was
a
broken
dam
and
beside
it
a
dismantled
mill
here
was
peace
for
roger
soul
the
next
day
at
dawn
he
awakened
and
through
the
window
close
by
his
bed
he
saw
no
tall
confining
walls
his
eye
was
carried
as
on
wings
out
over
a
billowy
blanket
of
mist
soft
and
white
and
cool
and
still
reaching
over
the
valley
from
underneath
to
his
sensitive
ears
came
the
numberless
voices
of
the
awakening
sleepers
there
cheeps
and
tremulous
warbles
from
the
birch
copse
just
below
cocks
crowing
in
the
valley
and
ducks
and
geese
dogs
sheep
and
cattle
faintly
heard
from
distant
farms
just
so
it
had
been
when
he
was
a
boy
how
unchanged
and
yet
how
new
were
these
fresh
hungry
cries
of
life
from
the
other
end
of
the
house
he
heard
edith
tiny
son
lustily
demanding
his
breakfast
as
other
wee
boys
before
him
had
done
for
over
a
hundred
years
as
other
babies
still
unborn
would
do
in
the
many
years
to
come
soon
the
cry
of
the
child
was
hushed
quiet
fell
upon
the
house
and
roger
sank
again
into
deep
happy
slumber
here
was
nothing
new
and
disturbing
edith
children
yes
they
were
new
but
they
were
not
disturbing
their
growth
each
summer
was
a
joy
a
renewal
of
life
in
the
battered
old
house
here
was
no
huge
tenement
family
crowding
in
with
dirty
faces
clamorous
demands
for
aid
but
only
five
delightful
youngsters
clean
and
fresh
of
his
own
blood
he
loved
the
small
excitements
the
plans
and
plots
and
discoveries
the
many
adventures
that
filled
their
days
he
spent
hours
with
their
mother
listening
while
she
talked
of
them
edith
did
so
love
this
place
and
she
ran
the
house
so
beautifully
it
was
so
cool
and
fragrant
so
clean
and
so
deborah
too
came
under
the
spell
she
grew
as
lazy
as
a
cat
and
day
by
day
renewed
her
strength
from
the
hills
and
from
edith
little
brood
roger
had
feared
trouble
there
for
he
knew
how
edith
disapproved
of
her
sister
new
ideas
but
although
much
with
the
children
deborah
apparently
had
no
new
ideas
at
all
she
seemed
to
be
only
listening
one
balmy
day
at
sunset
roger
saw
her
lying
on
the
grass
with
george
sprawled
by
her
side
her
head
upon
one
arm
she
appeared
to
be
watching
the
cattle
in
the
sloping
pasture
above
slowly
as
though
each
one
of
them
was
drawn
by
mysterious
unseen
chains
they
were
drifting
down
toward
the
barn
where
it
was
almost
milking
time
george
was
talking
earnestly
she
threw
a
glance
at
him
from
time
to
time
and
roger
could
see
how
intent
were
her
eyes
yes
deborah
knew
how
to
study
a
boy
only
once
during
the
summer
did
she
talk
about
her
work
on
a
walk
with
her
father
one
day
she
took
him
into
a
small
forlorn
building
a
mere
cabin
of
one
room
the
white
paint
had
long
been
worn
away
the
windows
were
all
broken
half
the
old
shingles
had
dropped
from
the
roof
and
on
the
flagpole
was
no
flag
it
was
the
district
schoolhouse
where
for
nearly
half
his
life
deborah
grandfather
had
taught
a
score
of
pupils
inside
were
a
blackboard
a
rusty
stove
a
teacher
desk
and
a
dozen
forms
grown
mouldy
and
now
a
torn
and
faded
picture
of
lincoln
was
upon
one
wall
half
hidden
by
a
spider
web
and
by
a
few
old
dangling
rags
which
once
had
been
red
white
and
blue
below
still
clinging
to
the
wall
was
an
old
scrap
of
paper
on
which
in
a
large
rugged
hand
there
had
been
written
long
ago
a
speech
but
it
had
been
worn
away
until
but
three
words
were
legible
conceived
and
dedicated
tell
me
about
your
school
she
said
all
you
can
remember
seated
at
her
grandfather
desk
she
asked
roger
many
questions
and
his
recollections
at
first
dim
and
hazy
began
to
clear
a
little
by
george
he
exclaimed
here
are
my
initials
he
stooped
over
one
of
the
benches
oh
dearie
where
he
pointed
them
out
and
then
while
he
sat
on
the
rude
old
bench
for
some
time
more
she
questioned
him
but
your
school
was
not
all
here
she
said
musingly
at
last
it
was
up
on
the
farm
besides
where
you
learned
to
plough
and
sow
and
reap
and
take
care
of
the
animals
in
the
barn
and
mend
things
that
were
broken
and
oh
turn
your
hand
to
anything
but
millions
of
children
nowadays
are
growing
up
in
cities
you
see
half
frowning
and
half
smiling
she
began
to
talk
of
her
work
in
town
what
is
there
about
her
roger
asked
that
reminds
me
so
of
my
mother
his
mind
strayed
back
into
the
past
while
the
low
quiet
voice
of
his
daughter
went
on
and
a
wistful
expression
crept
over
his
face
what
would
she
do
with
the
family
name
what
life
would
she
lead
in
those
many
years
what
a
mother
she
would
make
the
words
rose
from
within
him
but
in
a
voice
which
was
not
his
own
it
was
deborah
grandmother
speaking
so
clearly
and
distinctly
that
he
gave
a
start
almost
of
alarm
and
if
you
do
believe
they
do
it
deborah
was
saying
you
know
what
in
children
only
we
got
to
help
bring
it
out
what
had
she
been
talking
about
he
remembered
the
words
a
new
nation
no
more
got
to
grope
around
in
the
dark
and
hunt
for
new
ways
and
learn
as
we
go
and
when
you
once
got
into
the
work
and
really
felt
the
thrill
of
it
all
well
then
it
seems
rather
foolish
and
small
to
bother
about
your
own
little
life
roger
spent
much
of
his
time
alone
he
took
long
rides
on
william
along
crooked
hilly
roads
as
the
afternoon
drew
to
its
end
the
shadows
would
creep
up
the
mountain
sides
to
their
summits
where
glowed
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
painting
the
slate
and
granite
crags
in
lovely
pink
and
purple
hues
and
sometimes
mighty
banks
of
clouds
would
rear
themselves
high
overhead
gigantic
mountains
of
the
air
with
billowy
misty
caverns
cliffs
and
jagged
peaks
all
shifting
there
before
his
eyes
and
he
would
think
of
judith
his
wife
and
the
old
haunting
certainty
that
her
soul
had
died
with
her
body
was
gone
there
came
to
him
the
feeling
that
he
and
his
wife
would
meet
again
why
did
this
hope
come
back
to
him
was
it
all
from
the
glory
of
the
sun
or
was
it
from
the
presence
silent
and
invisible
of
those
many
other
mortals
folk
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
who
at
their
deaths
had
gone
to
their
graves
to
put
on
immortality
or
was
this
deepening
faith
in
roger
simply
a
sign
of
his
growing
old
age
he
frowned
at
the
thought
and
shook
it
off
and
again
stared
up
at
the
light
on
the
hills
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
was
there
no
other
immortality
he
often
thought
of
his
boyhood
here
on
a
ride
one
day
he
stopped
for
a
drink
at
a
spring
in
a
grove
of
maples
surrounding
a
desolate
farmhouse
not
more
than
a
mile
away
from
his
own
and
through
the
trees
as
he
turned
to
go
he
saw
the
stark
figure
of
a
woman
poorly
clad
and
gaunt
and
gray
she
stood
motionless
watching
him
with
a
look
of
sullen
bitterness
she
was
the
last
of
the
elkinses
a
mountain
family
run
to
seed
as
he
rode
away
he
saw
in
the
field
a
boy
with
a
pitchfork
in
his
hands
a
meager
ragged
little
chap
he
was
staring
into
the
valley
at
a
wriggling
blue
smoke
serpent
made
by
the
night
express
to
new
york
and
something
leaped
in
roger
for
he
had
once
felt
just
like
that
but
the
woman
harsh
voice
cut
in
on
his
dream
as
she
shouted
to
her
son
below
hey
why
the
hell
you
standin
thar
and
the
boy
with
a
jump
of
alarm
turned
back
quickly
to
his
work
at
home
a
few
days
later
george
with
a
mysterious
air
took
his
grandfather
into
the
barn
and
after
a
pledge
of
secrecy
he
said
in
swift
and
thrilling
tones
you
know
young
bill
elkins
yes
you
do
the
boy
up
on
the
elkins
place
who
lives
alone
with
his
mother
well
look
here
george
swallowed
hard
bill
has
cleared
out
he
run
away
i
was
up
at
five
this
morning
and
he
came
hiking
down
the
road
he
had
a
bundle
on
his
back
and
he
told
me
he
was
off
for
good
and
was
he
scared
you
bet
he
was
scared
and
i
told
him
so
and
it
made
him
mad
you
scared
i
said
ai
neither
he
said
he
could
barely
talk
but
the
kid
had
his
nerve
you
going
i
asked
new
york
he
said
what
do
you
know
of
new
york
i
said
and
then
by
golly
he
busted
right
down
he
said
ca
you
lem
me
alone
and
then
he
beat
it
down
the
road
you
could
hear
the
kid
breathe
he
was
hustling
so
he
way
off
now
caught
the
train
he
wants
to
be
a
cabin
boy
on
a
big
ocean
liner
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
well
the
boy
demanded
what
do
you
think
of
his
chances
i
do
know
said
roger
huskily
he
felt
a
tightening
at
his
throat
abruptly
he
turned
to
his
grandson
george
he
asked
what
do
want
to
be
the
boy
flushed
under
his
freckles
i
do
know
as
i
know
i
thinking
he
answered
very
slowly
talk
it
over
with
your
mother
son
yes
sir
came
the
prompt
reply
but
he
wo
reflected
roger
or
if
you
ever
feel
you
want
to
have
a
good
long
talk
with
me
yes
sir
was
the
answer
roger
stood
there
waiting
then
turned
and
walked
slowly
out
of
the
barn
how
these
children
grew
up
inside
of
themselves
had
boys
always
grown
like
that
well
perhaps
but
how
strange
it
was
always
new
lives
lives
of
their
own
the
old
families
scattering
over
the
land
so
the
great
life
of
the
nation
swept
on
he
kept
noticing
here
deserted
farms
and
one
afternoon
in
the
deepening
dusk
he
rode
by
a
graveyard
high
up
on
a
bare
hillside
a
horse
and
buggy
were
outside
and
within
he
spied
a
lean
young
woman
neatly
dressed
in
a
plain
dark
suit
with
a
lawn
mower
brought
from
home
she
was
cutting
the
grass
on
her
family
lot
and
she
seemed
to
fit
into
the
landscape
new
england
had
grown
very
old
late
one
night
toward
the
end
of
july
there
came
a
loud
honk
from
down
the
hill
then
another
and
another
and
as
george
in
his
pajamas
came
rushing
from
his
bedroom
shouting
radiantly
gee
it
dad
they
heard
the
car
thundering
outside
bruce
had
left
new
york
at
dawn
and
had
made
the
run
in
a
single
day
three
hundred
and
eleven
miles
he
was
gray
with
dust
all
over
and
he
was
worn
and
hollow
eyed
but
his
dark
visage
wore
a
look
of
solid
satisfaction
i
needed
the
trip
to
shake
me
down
he
pleaded
when
edith
scolded
him
well
for
this
terrific
manner
of
starting
his
vacation
i
had
to
have
it
to
cut
me
off
from
the
job
i
left
behind
me
now
watch
me
settle
down
on
this
farm
but
it
appeared
he
could
not
settle
down
for
the
first
few
days
in
his
motor
he
was
busy
exploring
the
mountains
we
make
look
foolish
eh
son
he
said
and
with
george
who
mutely
adored
him
he
ran
all
about
them
in
a
day
genially
he
gave
everyone
rides
when
he
finished
with
the
family
he
took
dave
royce
the
farmer
and
his
wife
and
children
and
even
both
the
hired
men
for
bruce
was
an
hospitable
soul
but
more
than
anyone
else
he
took
george
they
spent
hours
working
on
the
car
and
at
times
when
they
came
into
the
house
begreased
and
blackened
from
their
work
edith
reproved
them
like
bad
boys
but
deborah
smiled
contentedly
but
at
the
end
of
another
week
bruce
grew
plainly
restless
and
despite
his
wife
remonstrances
made
ready
to
return
to
town
when
she
spoke
of
his
hay
fever
he
bragged
to
her
complacently
of
his
newly
discovered
cure
oh
bother
your
little
blue
bugs
she
cried
the
bugs
are
blue
he
explained
to
her
in
a
mild
and
patient
voice
that
drove
edith
nearly
wild
they
so
little
they
have
no
color
at
all
poor
friendly
little
devils
bruce
his
wife
exploded
they
been
almighty
good
to
me
you
ought
to
have
heard
my
friend
the
judge
the
last
night
i
was
with
him
he
patted
his
bottle
and
said
to
me
my
boy
with
all
these
simple
animals
right
here
as
our
companions
why
be
a
damn
fool
and
run
off
to
the
cows
and
there
a
good
deal
in
what
he
says
you
ought
to
be
mighty
thankful
too
that
my
summer
pleasures
are
so
mild
if
you
could
see
what
some
chaps
do
and
bruce
started
back
for
the
city
george
rode
with
him
the
first
few
miles
then
left
him
and
came
trudging
home
his
spirits
were
exceedingly
low
as
august
drew
toward
a
close
deborah
too
showed
signs
of
unrest
with
ever
growing
frequency
roger
felt
her
eagerness
to
return
to
her
work
in
new
york
you
as
bad
as
bruce
he
growled
at
her
you
do
have
to
be
back
he
argued
school
does
begin
for
nearly
three
weeks
there
the
suffrage
campaign
she
answered
he
gave
her
a
look
of
exasperation
now
what
the
devil
has
suffrage
to
do
with
your
schools
he
demanded
when
the
women
get
the
vote
we
spend
more
money
on
the
children
suppose
the
money
is
there
was
roger
grim
rejoinder
then
we
act
like
wives
i
suppose
his
daughter
answered
cheerfully
and
keep
nagging
till
it
is
there
we
keep
up
such
a
nagging
she
added
in
sweet
even
tones
that
you
get
the
money
by
hook
or
crook
to
save
yourselves
from
going
insane
after
this
he
caught
her
reading
in
the
new
york
papers
the
list
of
campaign
meetings
each
night
meetings
in
hot
stifling
halls
or
out
upon
deafening
corners
and
as
she
read
there
came
over
her
face
a
look
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
given
up
tobacco
and
suddenly
sniffs
it
among
his
friends
she
went
down
the
last
night
of
august
roger
stayed
on
for
another
two
weeks
on
into
the
best
time
of
the
year
for
now
came
the
nights
of
the
first
snapping
frosts
when
the
dome
of
the
heavens
was
steely
blue
and
clear
sparkling
mornings
the
woods
aflame
with
scarlet
and
gold
and
across
the
small
field
below
the
house
at
sunset
roger
would
go
down
to
the
copse
of
birches
there
and
find
it
filled
with
glints
of
light
that
took
his
glance
far
in
among
the
slender
creamy
stems
of
the
trees
all
slowly
swaying
to
and
fro
the
leafage
rich
with
autumn
hues
warm
orange
yellow
and
pale
green
lovely
and
silent
and
serene
so
it
had
been
when
he
was
a
boy
and
so
it
would
be
when
he
was
dead
countless
trees
had
been
cut
down
but
others
had
risen
in
their
stead
now
and
then
he
could
hear
a
bird
warbling
long
ago
this
spot
had
been
his
mother
favorite
refuge
from
her
busy
day
in
the
house
she
had
almost
always
come
alone
but
sometimes
roger
stealing
down
would
watch
her
sitting
motionless
and
staring
in
among
the
trees
years
later
in
his
reading
he
had
come
upon
the
phrase
sacred
grove
and
at
once
he
had
thought
of
the
birches
and
sitting
here
where
she
had
been
he
felt
again
that
boundless
faith
in
life
resplendent
conquering
death
and
serenely
sweeping
him
on
into
what
he
did
not
fear
for
this
had
been
his
mother
faith
sometimes
in
the
deepening
dusk
he
could
almost
see
her
sitting
here
this
faith
in
you
has
come
from
me
this
is
my
memory
living
on
in
you
my
son
though
you
do
not
know
how
many
times
have
i
held
you
back
how
many
times
have
i
urged
you
on
roused
you
up
or
soothed
you
made
you
hope
or
fear
or
dream
through
memories
of
long
ago
for
you
were
once
a
part
of
me
i
moulded
you
my
little
son
and
as
i
have
been
to
you
so
you
will
be
to
your
children
in
their
lives
too
we
shall
be
there
silent
and
invisible
the
dim
strong
figures
of
the
past
for
this
is
the
power
of
families
this
is
the
mystery
of
birth
suddenly
he
started
what
was
it
that
had
thrilled
him
so
only
a
tall
dark
fir
in
the
birches
but
looming
in
there
like
a
shadowy
phantom
it
had
recalled
a
memory
of
a
dusk
far
back
in
his
boyhood
when
seeing
a
shadow
just
like
this
he
had
thought
it
a
ghost
in
very
truth
and
had
run
for
the
house
like
a
rabbit
how
terribly
real
that
fright
had
been
the
recollection
suddenly
became
so
vivid
in
his
mind
that
as
though
a
veil
had
been
lifted
he
felt
the
living
presence
here
close
by
his
side
of
a
small
barefoot
mountain
lad
clothed
in
sober
homespun
gray
but
filled
with
warm
desires
dreams
and
curiosities
exploring
upon
every
hand
now
marching
boldly
forward
now
stealing
up
so
cautiously
now
galloping
away
like
mad
i
was
once
a
child
to
most
of
us
these
are
mere
words
to
few
is
it
ever
given
to
attain
so
much
as
even
a
glimpse
into
the
warm
and
quivering
soul
of
that
little
stranger
of
long
ago
we
do
not
know
how
we
were
made
i
moulded
you
my
little
son
and
as
i
have
been
to
you
so
you
will
be
to
your
children
in
their
lives
too
we
shall
be
there
darker
darker
grew
the
copse
and
the
chill
of
the
night
descended
but
to
roger
eyes
there
was
no
gloom
for
he
had
seen
a
vision
chapter
xv
on
his
return
to
the
city
roger
found
that
deborah
school
had
apparently
swept
all
other
interests
out
of
her
mind
baird
hardly
ever
came
to
the
house
and
she
herself
was
seldom
there
except
for
a
hasty
dinner
at
night
the
house
had
to
run
itself
more
or
less
and
though
annie
the
cook
was
doing
her
best
things
did
not
run
so
smoothly
roger
missed
little
comforts
attentions
and
he
missed
deborah
most
of
all
when
he
came
down
to
his
breakfast
she
had
already
left
the
house
and
often
she
did
not
return
until
long
after
he
was
in
bed
she
felt
the
difference
herself
and
though
she
did
not
put
it
in
words
her
manner
at
times
seemed
to
beg
his
forbearance
but
there
were
many
evenings
when
her
father
found
it
difficult
to
hold
to
the
resolve
he
had
made
to
go
slowly
with
his
daughter
until
he
could
be
more
sure
of
his
ground
she
was
growing
so
intense
again
from
the
school
authorities
she
had
secured
a
still
wider
range
and
freedom
for
her
new
experiment
and
she
was
working
day
and
night
to
put
her
ideas
into
effect
it
only
too
easy
she
remarked
to
launch
an
idea
in
this
town
the
town
will
put
it
in
headlines
at
once
and
with
it
a
picture
of
yourself
in
your
best
bib
and
tucker
looking
as
though
you
loved
the
whole
world
and
you
can
make
a
wonderful
splurge
until
they
go
on
to
the
next
new
thing
the
real
trouble
comes
in
working
it
out
and
this
she
had
set
out
to
do
many
nights
in
the
autumn
roger
went
down
to
the
school
to
try
to
get
some
clear
idea
of
this
vision
of
hers
for
children
which
in
a
vague
way
he
could
feel
was
so
much
larger
than
his
own
for
he
had
seen
its
driving
force
in
the
grip
it
had
upon
her
life
at
first
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
at
all
everywhere
chaos
met
his
eyes
but
he
found
something
formless
huge
that
made
to
him
a
strong
appeal
the
big
building
fairly
hummed
at
night
with
numberless
activities
fathers
mothers
and
children
came
pouring
in
together
and
went
skurrying
off
to
their
places
they
learned
to
speak
english
to
read
and
write
grown
men
and
women
scowled
and
toiled
over
their
arithmetic
they
worked
at
trades
in
the
various
shops
they
hammered
and
sawed
and
set
up
type
they
cooked
and
sewed
and
gossiped
the
young
galician
socialist
girls
debated
on
the
question
resolved
that
woman
suffrage
has
worked
in
colorado
the
caruso
pleasure
club
gave
a
dance
to
the
garibaldi
whirlwinds
an
orchestra
rehearsed
like
mad
they
searched
their
memories
for
the
songs
and
all
the
folk
tales
they
had
heard
in
peasant
huts
in
italy
in
hamlets
along
rocky
coasts
in
the
dark
old
ghettos
of
crowded
towns
in
poland
and
in
russia
and
some
of
these
songs
were
sung
in
school
and
some
of
these
tales
were
dramatized
here
children
and
parents
all
took
part
and
speakers
emerged
from
the
neighborhood
it
was
at
times
appalling
the
number
of
young
italians
and
jews
who
had
ideas
to
give
forth
to
their
friends
on
socialism
poverty
marriage
and
religion
and
all
the
other
questions
that
rose
among
these
immigrants
jammed
into
this
tenement
hive
but
when
there
were
too
many
of
these
guides
the
neighborhood
shut
down
on
them
we
do
want
declared
one
indignant
old
woman
that
every
young
loafer
should
shout
in
our
face
roger
was
slowly
attracted
into
this
enormous
family
life
and
yielding
to
an
impulse
he
took
charge
of
a
boys
club
which
met
on
thursday
evenings
there
he
knew
well
this
job
of
fathering
a
small
jovial
group
of
lads
he
had
done
it
before
many
years
ago
in
the
mission
school
to
please
his
wife
he
felt
himself
back
on
familiar
ground
and
from
this
point
of
vantage
with
something
definite
he
could
do
he
watched
with
an
interest
more
clear
the
school
form
steadily
closer
ties
with
the
tenements
that
hedged
it
gathering
its
big
family
and
this
family
by
slow
degrees
began
to
make
itself
a
part
of
the
daily
life
of
roger
house
committees
held
their
meetings
here
teachers
dropped
in
frequently
and
roger
invited
the
boys
in
his
club
to
come
up
and
see
him
whenever
they
liked
his
most
frequent
visitor
was
johnny
geer
the
cripple
he
was
working
in
roger
office
now
and
the
two
had
soon
become
close
friends
john
kept
himself
so
neat
and
clean
he
displayed
such
a
keen
interest
in
all
the
details
of
office
work
and
he
showed
such
a
beaming
appreciation
of
anything
that
was
done
for
him
that
boy
is
getting
a
hold
on
me
lately
almost
like
a
boy
of
my
own
roger
said
one
evening
when
allan
baird
was
at
the
house
he
the
pluckiest
young
un
i
ever
met
i
put
him
to
work
in
my
private
office
where
he
can
use
the
sofa
to
rest
and
i
made
him
my
own
stenographer
partly
because
he
so
quick
at
dictation
and
partly
to
try
to
make
him
slow
down
he
has
the
mind
of
a
race
horse
he
runs
at
night
to
libraries
until
i
should
think
he
go
insane
and
his
body
ca
stand
it
he
breaking
down
though
whenever
i
ask
him
how
he
feels
he
always
says
thank
you
here
roger
turned
to
allan
i
wish
you
take
the
boy
he
said
to
the
finest
specialist
in
town
and
see
what
can
be
done
for
his
spine
i
pay
any
price
there
wo
be
any
price
said
allan
but
i
see
to
it
at
once
he
had
john
examined
the
same
week
well
asked
roger
when
next
they
met
well
said
baird
it
is
good
news
you
mean
he
hopeless
allan
nodded
it
pott
disease
and
it
gone
too
far
john
is
eighteen
he
may
live
to
be
thirty
but
i
tell
you
baird
i
do
anything
there
almost
nothing
you
can
do
if
he
had
been
taken
when
he
was
a
baby
he
might
have
been
cured
and
given
a
chance
but
the
same
mother
who
dropped
him
then
when
she
was
full
of
liquor
just
went
to
the
druggist
on
her
block
and
after
listening
to
his
advice
she
bought
some
patent
medicine
a
steel
jacket
and
some
crutches
and
thought
she
done
her
duty
but
there
must
be
something
we
can
do
retorted
roger
angrily
yes
said
baird
we
can
make
him
a
little
more
comfortable
and
meanwhile
we
can
help
deborah
here
to
get
hold
of
other
boys
like
john
and
give
a
chance
before
it
too
late
keep
them
from
being
crippled
for
life
because
their
mothers
were
too
blind
and
ignorant
to
act
in
time
baird
voice
had
a
ring
of
bitterness
most
of
love
their
children
roger
said
uneasily
baird
turned
on
him
a
steady
look
love
is
enough
he
retorted
the
time
is
coming
very
soon
when
have
the
right
to
guard
the
child
not
only
when
it
a
baby
but
even
before
it
has
been
born
roger
drew
closer
to
john
after
this
often
behind
the
beaming
smile
he
would
feel
the
pain
and
loneliness
and
the
angry
grit
which
was
fighting
it
down
and
so
he
would
ask
john
home
to
supper
on
nights
when
nobody
else
was
there
one
day
late
in
the
afternoon
they
were
walking
home
together
along
the
west
side
of
madison
square
the
big
open
space
was
studded
with
lights
sparkling
up
at
the
frosty
stars
in
a
city
a
world
a
universe
that
seemed
filled
with
the
zest
and
the
vigor
of
life
out
of
these
lights
a
mighty
tower
loomed
high
up
into
the
sky
and
stopping
on
his
crutches
a
grim
small
crooked
figure
in
all
this
rushing
turmoil
john
set
his
jaws
and
with
his
shrewd
and
twinkling
eyes
fixed
on
the
top
of
the
tower
he
said
i
meant
to
tell
you
gale
you
was
asking
me
once
what
i
wanted
to
be
and
i
want
to
be
an
architect
do
eh
grunted
roger
he
too
looked
up
at
that
thing
in
the
stars
and
there
was
a
tightening
at
his
throat
all
right
he
added
presently
why
not
start
in
and
be
one
how
asked
john
alertly
well
my
boy
said
roger
i
hate
to
lose
you
in
the
office
yes
sir
and
i
hate
to
go
just
then
the
big
clock
in
the
tower
began
to
boom
the
hour
and
a
chill
struck
into
roger
you
have
to
he
said
gruffly
you
have
any
time
to
lose
i
mean
he
hastily
added
that
for
a
job
as
big
as
that
you
need
a
lot
of
training
but
if
it
what
you
want
to
be
go
right
ahead
i
back
you
my
is
a
builder
at
present
i
talk
to
him
and
get
his
advice
we
may
be
able
to
arrange
to
have
you
go
right
into
his
office
begin
at
the
bottom
and
work
straight
up
in
silence
for
a
moment
john
hobbled
on
by
roger
side
i
hate
to
leave
your
place
he
said
i
know
was
roger
brusque
reply
and
i
hate
to
lose
you
we
have
to
think
it
over
a
few
days
later
he
talked
with
bruce
who
said
he
be
glad
to
take
the
boy
and
at
dinner
that
night
with
deborah
roger
asked
abruptly
why
not
let
johnny
come
here
for
a
while
and
use
one
of
our
empty
bedrooms
with
a
quick
flush
of
pleased
surprise
deborah
gave
her
father
a
look
that
embarrassed
him
tremendously
well
why
not
he
snapped
at
her
sensible
is
it
perfectly
and
sensible
it
turned
out
to
be
when
john
first
heard
about
it
he
was
apparently
quite
overcome
and
there
followed
a
brief
awkward
pause
while
he
rapidly
blinked
the
joy
from
his
eyes
but
then
he
said
fine
thank
you
that
mighty
good
of
you
gale
in
as
matter
of
fact
a
tone
as
you
please
and
he
entered
the
household
in
much
the
same
way
for
john
had
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
he
had
always
kept
himself
neat
and
clean
but
he
became
immaculate
now
he
dined
with
roger
the
first
night
but
early
the
next
morning
he
went
down
to
the
kitchen
and
breakfasted
there
and
from
this
time
on
unless
he
were
especially
urged
to
come
up
to
the
dining
room
john
took
all
his
meals
downstairs
the
maids
were
irish
so
was
john
they
were
good
catholics
so
was
john
they
loved
the
movies
so
did
john
in
short
it
worked
out
wonderfully
in
less
than
a
month
john
had
made
himself
an
unobtrusive
and
natural
part
of
the
life
of
roger
sober
old
house
it
had
had
to
stretch
just
a
little
no
more
chapter
xvi
but
that
winter
there
was
more
in
the
house
than
deborah
big
family
though
at
times
roger
felt
it
surging
in
with
its
crude
immense
vitality
there
were
other
times
when
it
was
not
so
and
the
lives
of
his
other
two
daughters
attracted
his
attention
for
both
were
back
again
in
town
laura
and
her
husband
had
returned
from
abroad
in
october
and
in
a
small
but
expensive
apartment
in
a
huge
new
building
facing
on
park
avenue
they
had
gaily
started
the
career
of
their
own
little
family
or
ménage
as
laura
called
it
this
word
had
stuck
in
roger
mind
for
he
had
a
suspicion
that
a
ménage
was
no
place
for
babies
grimly
when
he
went
there
first
to
be
shown
the
new
home
by
its
mistress
he
looked
about
him
for
a
room
which
might
be
made
a
nursery
but
no
such
room
was
in
evidence
we
decided
to
have
no
guest
room
he
heard
laura
say
to
deborah
and
glancing
at
his
daughter
then
sleek
and
smiling
and
demure
in
her
fresh
from
paris
roger
darkly
told
himself
that
a
child
would
be
an
unwelcome
guest
the
whole
place
was
as
compact
and
sparkling
as
a
jewel
box
the
bed
chamber
was
luxurious
with
a
gorgeous
bath
adjoining
and
a
for
harold
and
look
at
this
love
of
a
closet
said
laura
to
deborah
eagerly
it
simply
enormous
as
deborah
looked
her
father
did
too
and
his
eye
was
met
by
an
array
of
shimmering
apparel
which
made
him
draw
back
almost
with
a
start
they
found
harold
in
the
pantry
their
jap
it
appeared
was
a
marvellous
cook
and
did
the
catering
as
well
so
that
laura
rarely
troubled
herself
to
order
so
much
as
a
single
meal
but
her
husband
had
for
many
years
been
famous
for
his
cocktails
and
although
the
jap
did
everything
else
hal
had
kept
this
in
his
own
hands
i
thought
this
much
of
the
ought
to
remain
in
the
family
he
said
roger
did
not
like
this
joke
but
later
when
he
had
imbibed
the
delicious
concoction
harold
had
made
and
had
eaten
the
dinner
created
by
that
japanese
artist
of
theirs
his
irritation
subsided
they
barely
know
we
here
he
thought
they
both
in
love
up
to
their
ears
despite
their
genial
attempts
to
be
hospitable
and
friendly
time
and
again
he
saw
their
glances
meet
in
an
intimate
gleaming
manner
which
made
him
rather
uncomfortable
but
where
was
the
harm
he
asked
himself
they
were
married
all
right
were
they
still
somehow
somehow
no
by
george
he
did
like
it
he
did
approve
the
whole
affair
was
decidedly
mixing
roger
went
away
vaguely
uneasy
and
he
felt
that
deborah
was
even
more
disturbed
than
himself
those
two
she
remarked
to
her
father
are
so
fearfully
wrapt
up
in
each
other
it
makes
me
afraid
oh
it
all
right
i
suppose
and
i
would
for
worlds
try
to
interfere
but
i
ca
help
feeling
somehow
that
no
two
people
with
such
an
abundance
of
youth
and
money
and
happiness
have
the
right
to
be
so
amazingly
selfish
they
ought
to
have
children
roger
said
but
look
at
edith
his
daughter
rejoined
she
has
a
single
interest
that
i
can
find
outside
her
home
it
seems
to
have
swallowed
her
body
and
soul
a
frowning
look
of
perplexity
swept
over
deborah
mobile
face
and
with
a
whimsical
sigh
she
exclaimed
oh
this
queer
business
of
families
in
december
there
came
a
little
crash
late
one
evening
laura
came
bursting
in
upon
them
in
a
perfect
tantrum
every
nerve
in
her
lithe
body
tense
her
full
lips
visibly
quivering
her
voice
unsteady
and
her
big
black
eyes
aflame
with
rage
she
was
jealous
of
her
husband
and
that
nasty
little
cat
roger
learned
no
more
about
it
for
deborah
motioned
him
out
of
the
room
he
heard
their
two
voices
talk
on
and
on
until
laura
slowly
quieted
down
soon
afterwards
she
left
the
house
and
deborah
came
in
to
him
she
gone
home
eh
asked
roger
yes
she
has
poor
silly
child
she
said
at
first
she
had
come
here
to
stay
by
george
he
said
as
bad
as
that
of
course
it
is
as
bad
as
that
deborah
cried
impatiently
she
just
built
and
built
on
silly
suspicions
and
let
herself
get
all
worked
up
i
do
see
what
they
coming
to
for
a
few
moments
nothing
was
said
it
so
unnatural
she
exclaimed
men
and
women
were
to
live
like
that
roger
scowled
into
his
paper
better
leave
alone
he
admonished
her
you
ca
help
they
not
your
kind
do
you
mix
into
this
affair
but
deborah
did
she
remembered
that
her
sister
had
once
shown
quite
a
talent
for
amateur
theatricals
and
to
give
laura
something
to
do
deborah
persuaded
her
to
take
a
dramatic
club
in
her
school
and
laura
rather
to
roger
surprise
became
an
enthusiast
down
there
she
worked
like
a
slave
at
rehearsals
and
upon
the
costumes
she
spent
money
with
a
lavish
hand
moreover
instead
of
being
annoyed
as
edith
was
at
deborah
prominence
in
the
press
laura
gloried
in
it
as
though
this
radical
sister
of
hers
were
a
distinct
social
asset
among
her
giddy
friends
uptown
for
even
laura
friends
her
father
learned
with
astonishment
had
acquired
quite
an
appetite
for
men
and
women
with
ideas
the
more
radical
the
better
but
the
way
laura
used
this
word
at
times
made
roger
blood
run
cold
she
was
vivid
in
her
approval
of
her
sister
whole
idea
as
a
scheme
of
wholesale
motherhood
which
would
give
a
perfectly
glorious
jolt
to
the
home
with
its
overworked
mothers
who
let
their
children
absorb
their
days
as
though
having
children
and
bringing
them
up
she
disdainfully
declared
were
something
every
woman
must
do
whether
she
happens
to
like
it
or
not
at
the
cost
of
any
real
growth
of
her
own
and
smilingly
she
hinted
at
impending
radical
changes
in
the
whole
relation
of
marriage
of
which
she
was
hearing
in
detail
at
a
series
of
lectures
to
young
wives
delivered
on
thursday
mornings
in
a
hotel
what
the
devil
was
getting
into
the
town
roger
frowned
his
deep
dislike
here
was
laura
with
her
chicken
mind
blithely
taking
her
thoughts
and
turning
them
to
make
for
herself
a
view
of
life
which
fitted
like
a
white
kid
glove
her
small
and
elegant
ménage
and
although
her
father
had
only
inklings
of
it
all
he
had
quite
enough
to
make
him
irate
at
this
uncanny
interplay
of
influences
in
his
family
why
could
the
girls
leave
each
other
alone
early
in
the
winter
edith
too
had
entered
in
it
had
taken
edith
just
one
glance
into
the
bride
apartment
to
grasp
laura
whole
scheme
of
existence
selfish
indulgent
and
abnormal
was
the
way
she
described
it
she
and
bruce
were
dining
with
roger
that
night
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
continued
edith
curtly
so
long
as
she
does
want
my
help
as
she
has
plainly
made
me
feel
i
certainly
sha
stand
in
her
way
you
absolutely
right
said
her
father
stick
to
it
said
bruce
approvingly
but
edith
did
not
stick
to
it
in
her
case
too
as
the
weeks
wore
on
those
subtle
family
ties
took
hold
and
made
her
feel
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
keep
up
appearances
so
she
and
bruce
dined
with
the
bride
and
groom
and
in
turn
had
them
to
dinner
and
these
dinners
as
bruce
confided
to
roger
were
occasions
no
man
could
forget
they
come
only
about
once
a
month
he
said
in
a
tone
of
pathos
but
it
seems
as
though
barely
a
week
had
gone
by
when
edith
says
to
me
again
dining
with
laura
and
hal
well
and
we
dine
young
sloane
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
a
chap
works
hard
downtown
and
worships
his
wife
the
way
he
lives
well
it
is
mine
and
mine
is
his
and
we
both
let
it
go
at
that
but
the
women
ca
they
have
it
in
each
sits
with
her
way
of
life
in
her
lap
you
ca
see
it
over
the
tablecloth
but
my
god
how
you
feel
it
the
worst
of
it
is
he
ended
that
after
one
of
these
terrible
meals
each
woman
is
more
set
than
before
in
her
own
way
of
living
not
that
i
do
like
edith
way
her
husband
added
hastily
edith
also
disapproved
of
the
fast
increasing
publicity
which
deborah
was
getting
i
may
be
very
she
remarked
to
her
father
but
i
ca
get
used
to
this
idea
that
a
woman
place
is
in
headlines
and
i
think
rather
hard
on
you
the
use
she
making
of
your
house
one
friday
night
when
she
came
to
play
chess
she
found
her
father
in
the
midst
of
a
boisterous
special
meeting
of
his
club
of
italian
boys
it
had
been
postponed
from
the
evening
before
and
though
roger
overcome
with
dismay
at
having
forgotten
edith
night
apologized
profusely
the
weekly
game
took
place
no
more
from
that
day
on
edith
pretty
sore
said
bruce
who
dropped
in
soon
afterwards
she
says
deborah
has
made
your
house
into
an
annex
to
her
school
roger
smoked
in
silence
his
whole
family
was
about
his
ears
my
boy
he
muttered
earnestly
you
and
i
must
stick
together
we
sure
must
agreed
his
and
what
more
if
we
to
keep
the
peace
we
got
to
try
to
put
some
punch
into
deborah
love
affair
she
ought
to
get
married
and
settle
down
yes
said
roger
dubiously
only
let
keep
it
to
ourselves
no
chance
of
that
was
the
cheerful
reply
you
ca
keep
edith
out
of
it
it
would
only
make
trouble
in
family
roger
gave
him
a
pitying
look
and
said
then
for
the
lord
sake
let
her
in
so
they
took
edith
into
their
councils
and
she
gave
them
an
indulgent
smile
suppose
you
leave
this
to
me
she
commanded
do
you
think
i
been
using
my
eyes
there
no
earthly
use
in
stepping
in
now
for
deborah
has
lost
her
head
she
sees
herself
a
great
new
woman
with
a
career
but
wait
till
the
present
subsides
till
the
newspapers
all
drop
her
and
she
is
thoroughly
tired
out
until
then
remember
we
keep
our
hands
off
do
you
think
you
can
asked
roger
with
a
little
glimmer
of
hope
i
she
retorted
most
certainly
i
mean
to
leave
her
alone
absolutely
until
she
comes
to
me
herself
when
she
does
we
know
time
to
begin
i
afraid
edith
is
hurt
about
something
said
deborah
to
her
father
about
a
month
after
this
little
talk
she
has
been
near
us
for
over
three
weeks
let
her
be
said
roger
in
alarm
i
mean
he
hastily
added
why
you
let
edith
come
when
she
likes
there
nothing
the
matter
it
simply
her
children
they
take
up
her
time
no
said
deborah
calmly
it
i
she
as
good
as
told
me
so
last
month
she
thinks
i
become
a
perfect
fanatic
without
a
spare
moment
or
thought
for
my
family
oh
my
family
roger
groaned
i
tell
you
deborah
you
wrong
children
are
probably
sick
in
bed
then
i
go
and
see
she
answered
something
has
happened
to
deborah
edith
informed
him
blithely
over
the
telephone
the
next
night
has
eh
grunted
roger
yes
she
was
here
to
see
me
and
something
has
happened
changing
fast
i
felt
it
in
all
kinds
of
ways
she
was
just
as
dear
as
she
could
be
and
lonely
as
though
she
were
feeling
her
age
i
really
think
we
can
do
something
now
all
right
let
do
something
roger
growled
and
edith
began
to
do
something
her
hostility
to
her
sister
had
completely
disappeared
in
its
place
was
a
friendly
affection
an
evident
desire
to
please
she
even
drew
laura
into
the
secret
and
there
was
a
gathering
of
the
clan
there
were
consultations
in
roger
den
deborah
is
to
get
married
the
feeling
of
it
crept
through
the
house
nothing
was
said
to
her
of
course
but
deborah
was
made
to
feel
that
her
two
sisters
had
drawn
close
and
their
influence
upon
her
choice
was
more
deep
and
subtle
than
she
knew
for
although
roger
family
had
split
so
wide
apart
between
his
three
daughters
there
were
still
mysterious
bonds
reaching
far
back
into
nursery
days
and
deborah
in
deciding
whether
to
marry
allan
baird
was
affected
more
than
she
was
aware
by
the
married
lives
of
her
sisters
all
she
had
seen
in
laura
ménage
all
that
she
had
ever
observed
in
growing
family
kept
rising
from
time
to
time
in
her
thoughts
as
she
vaguely
tried
to
picture
herself
a
wife
and
the
mother
of
children
so
the
family
with
those
subtle
bonds
from
the
past
began
to
press
steadily
closer
and
closer
around
this
one
unmarried
daughter
and
help
her
to
make
up
her
mind
chapter
xvii
but
she
did
not
appear
to
care
to
be
helped
nor
did
allan
he
rarely
came
to
the
house
and
he
went
to
edith
not
at
all
he
was
even
absent
from
her
christmas
tree
for
the
children
a
jolly
little
festivity
which
neither
he
nor
deborah
had
missed
in
years
what
has
got
into
him
roger
asked
and
shortly
after
christmas
he
called
the
fellow
up
on
the
drop
in
for
dinner
he
urged
and
he
added
distinctly
i
alone
are
you
i
be
glad
to
thank
you
baird
i
want
your
advice
and
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
said
now
then
to
himself
in
a
tone
of
firm
decision
but
later
as
the
day
wore
on
he
cursed
himself
for
what
he
had
done
do
it
beat
the
devil
he
thought
how
i
always
putting
my
foot
in
it
and
when
baird
came
into
the
room
that
night
he
loomed
to
roger
anxious
eye
if
anything
taller
than
before
but
his
manner
was
so
easy
his
gruff
voice
so
natural
and
he
seemed
to
take
this
little
party
of
two
so
quietly
as
a
matter
of
course
that
roger
was
soon
reassured
and
at
table
he
and
allan
got
on
even
better
than
before
baird
talked
of
his
life
as
a
student
in
vienna
bonn
and
edinburgh
and
of
his
first
struggles
in
new
york
his
talk
was
full
of
human
bits
some
tragic
more
amusing
and
roger
liking
for
the
man
increased
with
every
story
told
i
asked
you
here
he
bluntly
began
when
they
had
gone
to
the
study
to
smoke
to
talk
to
you
about
deborah
baird
gave
him
a
friendly
look
all
right
let
talk
about
her
it
strikes
me
you
were
right
last
year
said
roger
speaking
slowly
she
already
showing
the
strain
of
her
work
she
do
look
to
me
as
strong
as
she
was
she
looks
to
me
stronger
allan
replied
you
know
people
fool
doctors
now
and
then
and
she
seems
to
have
taken
a
fresh
start
i
feel
she
may
go
on
for
years
roger
was
silent
a
moment
chagrined
and
disappointed
have
you
had
a
good
chance
to
watch
her
he
asked
yes
and
i
watching
her
still
said
baird
i
see
her
down
there
at
the
school
she
tells
me
you
been
there
yourself
yes
said
roger
determinedly
and
i
mean
to
keep
on
going
i
trying
not
to
lose
hold
of
her
he
added
with
harsh
emphasis
baird
turned
and
frankly
smiled
at
him
then
you
have
probably
seen
he
replied
that
to
keep
any
hold
at
all
on
her
you
must
make
up
your
mind
as
i
have
done
that
strength
or
no
strength
this
job
of
hers
is
going
to
be
a
life
career
when
a
woman
who
has
held
a
job
without
a
break
for
eleven
years
can
feel
such
a
flame
of
enthusiasm
you
can
be
pretty
sure
i
think
it
is
the
deepest
part
of
her
at
least
i
feel
that
way
he
said
and
i
believe
the
only
way
to
keep
near
her
for
the
present
anyhow
is
to
help
her
in
her
work
when
baird
had
gone
roger
found
himself
angry
i
not
in
the
habit
young
man
he
thought
of
throwing
my
daughter
at
gentlemen
heads
if
you
feel
as
calm
and
contented
as
that
you
can
go
to
the
devil
far
be
it
from
me
to
lift
a
hand
in
fact
as
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
would
probably
make
her
a
mighty
poor
husband
he
worked
himself
into
quite
a
rage
but
an
hour
later
when
he
had
subsided
hold
on
he
thought
am
i
right
about
this
is
the
man
as
contented
as
he
talks
no
sir
not
for
a
minute
he
is
but
what
can
he
do
if
he
tried
making
love
to
deborah
he
simply
be
killing
his
chances
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
she
ca
think
of
anything
but
her
career
yes
sir
when
said
and
done
to
marry
a
modern
woman
is
no
child
play
it
means
thought
and
care
and
baird
has
made
up
his
mind
to
it
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
by
playing
a
long
waiting
game
he
just
slowly
and
quietly
nosing
his
way
into
her
school
because
it
her
life
and
a
mighty
shrewd
way
of
going
about
it
you
do
need
any
help
from
me
my
friend
all
you
need
is
to
be
let
alone
in
talks
at
home
with
deborah
and
in
what
he
himself
observed
at
school
roger
began
to
get
inklings
of
baird
long
waiting
game
he
found
that
several
months
before
allan
had
offered
to
start
a
free
clinic
for
mothers
and
children
in
connection
with
the
school
and
that
he
alone
had
put
it
through
with
only
the
most
reluctant
aid
and
gratitude
from
deborah
as
though
she
dreaded
something
baird
took
countless
hours
from
his
busy
uptown
practice
he
hurt
himself
more
than
once
in
fact
by
neglecting
rich
patients
to
do
this
work
where
a
sick
or
pregnant
mother
was
too
poor
to
carry
out
his
advice
he
followed
her
into
her
tenement
home
sent
one
of
his
nurses
to
visit
her
and
even
gave
money
when
it
was
needed
to
ease
the
strain
of
her
poverty
until
she
should
be
well
and
strong
soon
scores
of
the
mothers
of
deborah
children
were
singing
the
praises
of
doctor
baird
then
he
began
coming
to
the
house
i
was
right
thought
roger
complacently
he
laid
in
a
stock
of
fine
cigars
and
some
good
port
and
claret
too
and
on
evenings
when
baird
came
to
dine
roger
by
a
genial
glow
and
occasional
jocular
ironies
would
endeavor
to
drag
the
talk
away
from
clinics
adenoids
children
teeth
epidemics
and
the
new
education
but
no
joke
was
so
good
that
deborah
could
not
promptly
match
it
with
some
amusing
little
thing
which
one
of
her
children
had
said
or
done
for
she
had
a
mother
instinct
for
bragging
fondly
of
her
brood
it
was
deep
it
was
uncanny
this
queer
community
motherhood
this
poor
devil
roger
thought
with
a
pitying
glance
at
baird
might
just
as
well
be
marrying
a
widow
with
three
thousand
brats
but
baird
did
not
seem
in
the
least
dismayed
on
the
contrary
his
assurance
appeared
to
be
deepening
every
week
and
with
it
deborah
air
of
alarm
for
his
clinic
as
it
swiftly
grew
he
secured
financial
backing
from
his
rich
women
patients
uptown
many
of
them
childless
and
only
too
ready
to
respond
to
the
appeals
he
made
to
them
and
one
saturday
evening
at
the
house
while
dining
with
roger
and
deborah
he
told
of
an
offer
he
had
had
from
a
wealthy
banker
widow
to
build
a
maternity
hospital
he
talked
hungrily
of
all
it
could
do
in
with
the
school
he
said
nothing
of
the
obvious
fact
that
it
would
require
his
whole
time
but
roger
thought
of
that
at
once
and
by
the
expression
on
deborah
face
he
saw
she
was
thinking
too
he
felt
they
wanted
to
be
alone
so
presently
he
left
them
from
his
study
he
could
hear
their
voices
growing
steadily
more
intense
was
it
all
about
work
he
could
not
tell
they
got
working
and
living
so
mixed
up
a
man
ca
possibly
tell
apart
then
his
daughter
was
called
to
the
telephone
and
allan
came
in
to
bid
roger
and
his
eyes
showed
an
impatience
he
did
not
seem
to
care
to
hide
well
inquired
roger
did
you
get
deborah
consent
to
what
asked
allan
sharply
to
your
acceptance
roger
answered
of
the
widow
mite
baird
grinned
she
could
help
herself
he
said
but
she
did
seem
to
like
it
eh
no
said
baird
she
did
roger
had
a
dark
suspicion
by
the
way
he
asked
in
a
casual
tone
what
this
philanthropic
widow
like
she
baird
answered
oh
said
roger
he
smoked
for
a
time
and
sagely
added
my
daughter
a
queer
woman
baird
she
modern
very
modern
but
she
still
a
woman
you
understand
and
so
she
jealous
of
her
job
but
baird
was
in
no
joking
mood
she
narrow
he
said
sternly
that
what
the
matter
with
deborah
she
so
centered
on
her
job
she
ca
see
anyone
else
she
thinks
doing
all
this
work
solely
in
order
to
help
her
school
when
if
she
use
some
imagination
and
try
to
put
herself
in
my
shoes
she
see
the
chance
it
giving
how
do
you
mean
asked
roger
looking
a
bit
bewildered
why
said
baird
with
an
impatient
fling
of
his
hand
there
are
men
in
my
line
all
over
the
country
who
leave
home
wives
and
children
for
the
chance
i
blundered
onto
here
a
hospital
fully
equipped
for
research
a
free
hand
an
opportunity
which
comes
to
one
man
in
a
million
but
can
she
see
it
not
at
all
it
only
an
annex
to
her
school
yes
said
roger
gravely
she
in
a
pretty
unnatural
state
i
think
she
ought
to
get
married
baird
to
his
friendly
and
disarming
twinkle
baird
replied
with
a
rueful
smile
you
do
eh
he
growled
then
tell
her
to
plan
her
wedding
to
come
before
her
funeral
as
he
rose
to
go
roger
took
his
hand
i
tell
her
he
said
it
sound
advice
my
boy
i
wish
you
luck
a
few
moments
later
he
heard
in
the
hall
their
brief
to
each
other
and
presently
deborah
came
in
she
was
not
looking
quite
herself
why
are
you
eyeing
me
like
that
his
daughter
asked
abruptly
are
you
letting
him
do
a
good
deal
for
you
deborah
flushed
a
little
yes
i
am
i
ca
make
him
stop
her
father
hesitated
you
could
he
said
if
you
wanted
to
if
you
were
sure
he
added
slowly
that
you
did
love
him
and
told
him
so
he
felt
a
little
panic
for
he
thought
he
had
gone
too
far
but
his
daughter
only
turned
away
and
restlessly
moved
about
the
room
at
last
she
came
to
her
chair
had
you
better
leave
this
to
me
i
had
my
dear
i
most
certainly
had
i
was
all
wrong
to
mention
it
he
answered
very
humbly
from
this
night
on
baird
changed
his
tack
although
soon
busy
with
the
plans
for
the
hospital
to
be
built
at
once
he
said
little
about
it
to
deborah
instead
he
insisted
on
taking
her
off
on
little
evening
sprees
uptown
do
you
know
what
the
matter
with
both
of
us
he
said
to
her
one
evening
we
been
getting
too
durned
devoted
to
our
jobs
and
our
ideals
you
becoming
a
regular
school
marm
and
i
getting
to
be
a
regular
slave
to
every
wretched
little
babe
who
takes
it
into
his
head
to
be
born
we
have
one
redeeming
vice
and
again
he
took
up
dancing
the
first
effort
which
he
made
down
at
deborah
school
one
evening
was
a
failure
quite
as
dismal
as
his
attempts
of
the
previous
year
but
he
did
not
appear
in
the
least
discouraged
he
came
to
the
house
one
friday
night
i
knew
i
could
learn
to
dance
he
said
in
spite
of
all
your
taunts
and
jibes
that
little
fiasco
last
saturday
night
was
perfectly
awful
deborah
said
did
not
discourage
me
in
the
least
he
continued
severely
i
decided
the
only
trouble
with
me
was
that
i
tall
and
i
got
to
bend
to
learn
to
bend
tremendously
so
i
went
to
a
lady
professor
and
she
saw
the
point
at
once
since
then
i
had
five
lessons
and
i
can
in
my
sleep
is
saturday
where
shall
we
go
to
the
theater
good
we
start
with
that
but
the
minute
the
play
is
over
we
gallop
off
to
the
plaza
grill
just
as
the
music
is
in
full
swing
and
we
dance
she
groaned
for
hours
and
when
i
get
home
i
creep
into
bed
so
tired
and
sore
in
every
limb
that
you
sleep
late
sunday
morning
and
a
mighty
good
thing
for
you
too
if
you
ask
my
advice
i
do
ask
your
advice
you
getting
it
though
he
said
doggedly
if
you
still
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
we
dance
at
the
plaza
night
and
well
into
the
sabbath
the
principal
of
a
public
school
dancing
on
the
sabbath
suppose
one
of
my
friends
should
see
us
there
your
friends
he
replied
with
a
fine
contempt
do
not
dance
in
the
plaza
grill
i
the
only
roisterer
you
know
all
right
she
conceded
grudgingly
i
roister
come
and
get
me
but
i
much
prefer
when
the
play
is
done
to
come
home
and
have
milk
and
crackers
here
deborah
he
said
cheerfully
for
a
radical
school
reformer
you
the
most
conservative
woman
i
know
chapter
xviii
in
deborah
school
in
the
meantime
affairs
had
drawn
to
a
climax
the
moment
had
come
for
the
city
to
say
whether
her
new
experiment
should
be
dropped
the
following
year
or
allowed
to
go
on
and
develop
there
came
a
day
of
sharp
suspense
when
deborah
friends
and
enemies
on
the
board
of
education
sat
down
to
discuss
and
settle
her
fate
they
were
at
it
for
several
hours
but
late
in
the
afternoon
they
decided
not
only
to
let
her
go
on
the
next
year
but
to
try
her
idea
in
four
other
schools
and
place
her
in
charge
with
ample
funds
the
long
strain
came
to
an
end
at
last
in
a
triumph
beyond
her
wildest
hopes
when
the
news
arrived
she
relaxed
grew
limp
and
laughed
and
cried
a
little
and
her
father
felt
her
tremble
as
he
held
her
a
moment
in
his
arms
now
baird
he
thought
your
chance
has
come
for
god
sake
take
it
while
it
here
but
in
place
of
baird
that
afternoon
came
men
and
women
from
the
press
and
friends
and
fellow
workers
the
and
the
telephone
kept
ringing
almost
incessantly
why
could
they
leave
her
a
moment
peace
roger
buried
himself
in
his
study
later
when
he
was
called
to
dinner
he
found
that
allan
was
there
too
but
at
first
the
conversation
was
all
upon
deborah
victory
flushed
with
success
for
the
moment
engrossed
in
the
wider
field
she
saw
ahead
she
had
not
a
thought
for
anything
else
but
after
dinner
the
atmosphere
changed
to
hear
me
talk
she
told
them
you
think
the
whole
world
depended
on
me
and
on
my
school
and
my
ideas
me
me
me
and
it
has
been
me
all
winter
long
what
a
time
i
given
both
of
you
she
grew
repentant
and
grateful
first
to
her
father
and
then
to
allan
and
then
more
and
more
to
allan
with
her
happy
eyes
on
his
and
with
a
keen
worried
look
at
them
both
roger
rose
and
left
the
room
baird
was
leaning
forward
he
had
both
her
hands
in
his
own
well
he
asked
will
you
marry
me
now
her
eyes
were
looking
straight
into
his
they
kept
moving
slightly
searching
his
her
wide
sensitive
lips
were
tightly
compressed
but
did
not
quite
hide
their
quivering
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
low
and
a
little
queer
and
breathless
do
you
want
any
children
allan
yes
so
do
i
and
with
children
what
of
my
work
i
do
want
to
stop
your
work
if
you
marry
me
we
go
right
on
you
see
i
know
you
deborah
i
know
you
always
grown
like
that
by
risking
what
you
got
for
something
more
i
never
taken
a
risk
like
this
i
tell
you
this
time
it
no
risk
because
you
a
grown
woman
formed
i
not
making
a
saint
of
you
you
no
angel
down
among
the
poor
because
you
feel
it
your
duty
in
life
it
your
happiness
your
passion
you
could
neglect
them
if
you
tried
but
the
time
she
asked
him
quickly
where
shall
i
find
the
time
for
it
all
a
man
finds
time
enough
he
answered
even
when
he
married
but
i
not
a
man
i
a
woman
she
said
and
in
a
low
voice
which
thrilled
him
a
woman
who
wants
a
child
of
her
own
his
lean
muscular
right
hand
contracted
sharply
upon
hers
she
winced
drew
back
a
little
oh
i
sorry
he
whispered
then
he
asked
her
again
will
you
marry
me
now
she
looked
suddenly
up
let
wait
awhile
please
it
wo
be
long
i
in
love
with
you
allan
i
sure
of
that
now
and
i
not
drawing
back
i
not
afraid
oh
i
want
you
to
feel
i
not
running
away
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
face
this
square
it
may
be
silly
and
foolish
but
you
see
i
made
like
that
i
want
a
little
longer
i
want
to
think
it
out
by
myself
when
allan
had
gone
she
came
in
to
her
father
and
her
radiant
expression
made
him
bounce
up
from
his
chair
by
george
he
cried
he
asked
you
yes
and
you
taken
him
no
roger
gasped
look
here
he
demanded
angrily
what
the
matter
are
you
mad
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
at
him
no
i
not
i
happy
what
the
devil
about
he
snapped
we
going
to
wait
a
bit
that
all
till
we
sure
of
everything
she
cried
then
said
roger
disgustedly
you
smarter
than
your
father
is
sure
of
nothing
nothing
i
have
never
been
sure
in
all
my
days
if
waited
you
never
have
been
born
oh
dearie
she
begged
him
smilingly
please
do
be
so
unhappy
just
now
i
a
right
to
be
said
roger
i
see
my
house
agog
with
this
in
a
turmoil
in
a
turmoil
but
again
he
was
mistaken
it
was
in
fact
astonishing
how
the
old
house
quieted
down
there
came
again
one
of
those
peaceful
times
when
his
home
to
roger
senses
seemed
to
settle
deep
grow
still
and
gather
itself
together
day
by
day
he
felt
more
sure
that
deborah
was
succeeding
in
making
her
work
fit
into
her
swiftly
deepening
passion
for
a
full
happy
woman
life
and
why
should
they
live
here
allan
and
she
the
thought
of
this
dispelled
the
cloud
which
hung
over
the
years
he
saw
ahead
how
smoothly
things
were
working
out
the
monstrous
new
buildings
around
his
house
seemed
to
him
to
draw
back
as
though
balked
of
their
prey
on
the
mantle
in
roger
study
for
many
years
a
bronze
figure
there
the
thinker
huge
and
naked
forbidding
in
its
crouching
pose
the
heavy
chin
on
one
clenched
fist
had
brooded
down
upon
him
and
in
the
years
that
had
been
so
dark
it
had
been
a
figure
of
despair
often
he
had
looked
up
from
his
chair
and
grimly
met
its
frowning
gaze
but
roger
seldom
looked
at
it
now
and
even
when
it
caught
his
eye
it
had
little
effect
upon
him
it
appeared
to
brood
less
darkly
for
though
he
did
not
think
it
out
there
was
this
feeling
in
his
mind
there
is
to
be
nothing
startling
in
this
quiet
home
of
mine
no
crashing
deep
calamity
here
only
the
steadily
deepening
love
between
a
grown
man
and
a
woman
mature
both
sensible
strong
people
with
a
firm
control
of
their
destinies
he
felt
so
sure
of
this
affair
for
now
her
tension
once
relaxed
with
the
success
which
had
come
to
her
after
so
many
long
hard
years
a
new
deborah
was
revealed
more
human
in
her
yieldings
she
let
allan
take
her
off
on
the
wildest
little
sprees
uptown
and
out
into
the
country
to
roger
she
seemed
younger
more
warm
and
joyous
and
more
free
he
loved
to
hear
her
laugh
these
nights
to
catch
the
glad
new
tones
in
her
voice
there
is
to
be
no
tragedy
here
so
certain
of
this
union
and
wistful
for
all
he
felt
it
would
bring
roger
watched
its
swift
approach
and
when
the
news
came
he
was
sure
he
been
right
because
it
came
so
quietly
it
settled
dear
at
last
it
sure
allan
and
i
are
to
be
married
she
was
standing
by
his
chair
roger
reached
up
and
took
her
hand
i
glad
you
be
very
happy
my
child
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
and
putting
his
arm
around
her
he
drew
her
down
on
the
side
of
his
chair
now
tell
me
all
your
plans
he
said
and
her
answer
brought
him
a
deep
peace
we
going
abroad
for
the
summer
and
then
if
you
have
us
we
want
to
come
here
roger
abruptly
shut
his
eyes
by
george
deborah
he
said
you
do
have
a
way
of
getting
right
into
the
heart
of
things
his
arm
closed
about
her
with
new
strength
and
he
felt
all
his
troubles
flying
away
what
a
time
we
have
what
a
rich
new
life
her
deep
sweet
voice
was
a
little
unsteady
listen
dearie
how
quiet
it
is
and
for
some
moments
nothing
was
heard
but
the
sober
of
the
clock
on
the
mantle
i
wonder
what
we
going
to
hear
and
they
thought
of
new
voices
in
the
house
chapter
xix
edith
was
radiant
at
the
news
i
do
hope
they
not
going
to
grudge
themselves
a
good
long
wedding
trip
she
exclaimed
they
going
abroad
said
roger

roger

and
short
and
simple

edith
i
was
afraid

a
child
of
her

well

bad
enough
yes
but
can
she
edith
asked
with
the
engrossed
expression
which
came
on
her
pretty
florid
face
whenever
she
neared
such
a
topic
she
spoke
with
evident
awkwardness
that
the
trouble
is
it
too
late
you
know
and
she
has
lived
her
life
so
hard
the
sooner
she
gives
up
her
school
the
better
for
her
chances
the
face
of
her
father
clouded
look
here
he
said
uneasily
i
would
go
talking
to
her
quite
along
those
lines
my
dear
i
not
such
an
idiot
she
replied
she
thinks
me
homely
enough
as
it
is
and
she
not
altogether
wrong
bruce
and
i
were
talking
it
over
last
night
we
want
to
be
closer
after
this
to
deborah
and
allan

says
it

and
for
once
i
think
he

given
too
much
time
to
my
children
and
bruce
to
his
office
i
see
it
now
not
that
i
regret
it
but
well
we
going
to
blossom
out
she
struck
the
same
note
with
deborah
and
so
did
bruce
oh
deborah
dear
he
said
smiling
when
he
found
a
chance
to
see
her
alone
if
you
knew
how
long
i
waited
for
this
big
fine
thing
to
happen
baird
is
my
best
chum
in
the
world
do
yank
him
gently
away
from
us
now
we
keep
close
eh
all
four
of
us
very
said
deborah
softly
and
you
must
get
too
solemn
you
know
you
wo
pull
too
much
of
the
highbrow
stuff
heaven
forbid
that
the
right
idea
we
have
some
fine
little
parties
together
you
and
baird
will
give
us
a
hand
and
get
us
out
in
the
evenings

need
it
god

we
been
getting
old
deborah
threw
him
a
glance
of
affection
why
brucie
she
said
in
admiring
tones
i
knew
you
had
it
in
you
so
has
edith
he
sturdily
declared
she
only
needs
a
little
shove
show
you
two
that
we
regular
fellows
do
you
be
all
school
and
we
wo
be
all
home
we
jump
out
of
our
skins
and
be
young
again
in
pursuance
of
this
gay
resolve
bruce
planned
frequent
parties
to
theaters
and
musical
shows
and
to
edith
consternation
he
even
began
to
look
about
for
a
teacher
from
whom
he
could
learn
to
dance
baird
he
told
her
firmly
is
going
to
be
the
only
soubrette
in
this
family
one
of
the
most
hilarious
of
these
small
celebrations
came
early
in
june
when
they
dined
all
four
together
and
went
to
the
summer
opening
of
the
follies
of
the
show
rather
dragged
a
bit
at
first
but
when
bert
williams
took
the
stage
bruce
laugh
became
so
contagious
that
people
in
seats
on
every
hand
turned
to
look
at
him
and
join
in
his
glee
only
one
thing
happened
to
mar
the
evening
pleasure
when
they
came
outside
the
theater
bruce
found
in
his
car
something
wrong
with
the
engine
he
tinkered
but
it
would
not
go
allan
hailed
a
taxi
why
not
come
with
us
asked
deborah
no
thanks
said
bruce
i
got
this
car
to
look
after
oh
let
it
wait
urged
allan
it
does
look
a
little
like
rain
put
in
edith
bruce
glanced
up
at
the
cloudy
sky
and
hesitated
a
moment
rain
piffle
he
said
come
on
wifey
stick
by
me
i
wo
be
long
and
he
and
edith
went
back
to
his
car
what
a
dear
he
is
said
deborah
allan
put
his
arm
around
her
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
it
was
only
nine
days
to
the
wedding
out
of
the
street
commotion
came
a
sharp
cry
of
warning
it
was
followed
by
a
shriek
and
a
crash
allan
looked
out
of
the
window
and
then
with
a
low
exclamation
he
jumped
from
the
taxi
and
slammed
the
door
chapter
xx
roger
had
been
spending
a
long
quiet
evening
at
home
he
had
asked
john
to
dine
with
him
and
they
had
chatted
for
a
time
then
john
had
started
up
to
his
room
and
listening
to
the
slow
shuffling
step
of
the
cripple
going
upstairs
roger
had
thought
of
the
quick
eager
feet
and
the
sudden
scampers
that
would
be
heard
as
the
silent
old
house
renewed
its
life
later
he
had
gone
to
bed
he
awakened
with
a
start
the
telephone
bell
was
ringing
nice
time
to
be
calling
folks
out
of
bed
he
grumbled
as
he
went
into
the
hall
the
next
moment
he
heard
deborah
voice
it
was
clear
and
sharp
with
a
note
of
alarm
father
it
i
you
must
come
to
edith
apartment
at
once
bruce
is
hurt
badly
come
at
once
when
roger
reached
the
apartment
it
was
deborah
who
opened
the
door
her
face
had
changed
it
was
drawn
and
gray
she
took
him
into
the
living
room
tell
me
he
said
harshly
it
was
just
outside
the
theater
bruce
and
edith
were
out
in
the
street
and
got
caught
by
some
idiot
of
a
chauffeur
bruce
threw
edith
out
of
the
way
but
just
as
he
did
it
he
himself
got
struck
in
the
back
and
went
under
a
wheel
allan
brought
him
here
at
once
while
i
telephoned
for
a
friend
of
his
a
surgeon
they
with
bruce
now
where
edith
she
trying
to
quiet
the
children
they
all
woke
up
deborah
frowned
when
he
was
brought
in
she
added
well
breathed
roger
i
declare
dazed
and
stunned
he
sank
into
a
chair
soon
the
door
opened
and
allan
came
in
he
gone
he
said
and
deborah
jumped
no
no
i
meant
the
doctor
what
does
he
say
bruce
ca
live
said
allan
gently
in
the
tense
silence
there
came
a
chill
and
he
knows
it
allan
added
he
made
me
tell
him
he
said
he
must
know
for
business
reasons
he
wants
to
see
you
both
at
once
before
edith
gets
that
child
asleep
as
they
entered
the
room
they
saw
bruce
on
his
bed
he
was
breathing
quickly
through
his
narrow
jaws
and
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
with
a
straining
fixed
intensity
as
they
entered
he
turned
his
head
his
eyes
met
theirs
and
lighted
up
in
a
hard
and
terrible
manner
i
not
leaving
them
a
dollar
he
cried
we
see
to
them
boy
said
roger
hoarsely
but
bruce
had
already
turned
to
baird
i
make
you
my
executor
allan
do
need
it
in
writing
there
time
he
drew
a
sudden
quivering
breath
i
have
no
will
he
muttered
on
never
made
one
never
thought
of
this
business
life
just
starting
booming
and
i
put
in
every
cent
there
broke
from
him
a
low
bitter
groan
made
my
money
settling
other
men
muddles
never
thought
of
making
this
mess
of
my
own
but
even
in
mine
i
could
save
something
still
if
i
could
be
there
if
i
could
be
there
the
sweat
broke
out
on
his
temples
and
deborah
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
she
breathed
he
shut
his
eyes
hard
to
think
of
anything
any
more
i
ca
keep
clear
he
shuddered
with
pain
fix
me
for
he
muttered
to
baird
george
and
his
mother
fix
me
up
give
me
a
couple
of
minutes
clear
and
deborah
when
you
bring
in
do
let
know
you
understand
no
infernal
last
deborah
sharply
set
her
teeth
no
dear
no
she
whispered
she
followed
her
father
out
of
the
room
leaving
allan
bending
over
the
bed
with
a
hypodermic
in
his
hand
and
when
a
few
moments
later
george
came
in
with
his
mother
they
found
bruce
soothed
and
quieted
he
even
smiled
as
he
reached
up
his
hand
they
say
i
got
to
sleep
old
girl
just
sleep
and
sleep
it
do
me
good
so
you
must
stay
in
the
room
stay
with
the
kiddies
and
get
to
sleep
he
was
still
smiling
up
at
her
they
say
it
be
a
long
time
little
wife
and
i
so
sorry
i
was
to
blame
if
i
done
as
you
wanted
and
gone
in
their
taxi
remember
you
said
it
might
rain
he
turned
to
george
look
here
my
boy
i
counting
on
you
i
be
sick
you
know
no
good
at
all
you
must
stand
by
your
mother
george
gulped
awkwardly
sure
i
will
dad
his
father
sharply
pressed
his
hand
that
right
old
fellow
i
know
what
you
are
now
son
edith
dear
he
looked
at
her
steadily
just
for
a
moment
then
closed
his
eyes
oh
but
i
sleepy
he
murmured
and
they
left
him
alone
with
allan
bruce
looked
up
with
a
savage
glare
look
here
he
snarled
between
his
teeth
if
you
think
i
going
to
lie
here
and
die
you
mistaken
i
wo
i
wo
let
go
i

you
chaps

can
be
wrong

wrong
before

you
thousands
of
times
why

so
damnably
sure
about
he
fell
back
suddenly
limp
and
weak
so
damnably
sure
he
panted
we
never
sure
my
dear
old
boy
said
allan
very
tenderly
again
he
was
bending
close
over
the
bed
we
not
sure
yet
by
any
means
so
strong
old
chap
so
amazingly
strong
you
given
me
hope
what
are
you
sticking
into
my
arm
but
allan
kept
talking
steadily
on
you
given
me
hope
you
pull
through
still
but
not
like
this
got
to
rest
let
go
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
i
afraid
to
came
the
whisper
but
soon
as
again
the
drug
took
hold
he
mumbled
in
a
drowsy
tone
afraid
to
go
to
sleep
in
the
dark
say
allan
get
deborah
in
here
will
you
just
for
a
minute
one
thing
more
when
she
came
he
did
not
open
his
eyes
that
you
deborah
where
your
hand
oh
there
it
is
just
one
more
point
you
you
again
his
mind
wandered
but
with
an
effort
he
brought
it
back
you
and
edith
he
said
in
a
whisper
so
so
so
different
not
not
like
each
other
at
all
but
you
stick
together
eh
always
always
do
let
go
i
mean
of
my
hand
no
dear
no
and
with
her
hand
holding
his
she
sat
for
a
long
time
perfectly
still
then
the
baby
was
heard
crying
and
deborah
went
to
the
nursery
now
edith
i
see
to
the
children
she
said
allan
says
you
can
go
to
bruce
if
you
like
edith
looked
up
at
deborah
quickly
and
as
quickly
turned
away
she
went
in
to
her
husband
and
there
hour
by
hour
through
the
night
while
he
lay
inert
with
his
hand
in
hers
little
by
little
she
understood
but
she
asked
no
question
of
anyone
at
last
bruce
stirred
a
little
and
began
breathing
deep
and
fast
and
so
death
came
into
the
family
chapter
xxi
roger
went
through
the
next
two
days
in
a
kind
of
a
stupor
he
remembered
holding
edith
and
feeling
her
shudder
as
though
from
a
chill
he
remembered
being
stopped
in
the
hall
by
george
who
had
dressed
himself
with
care
in
his
first
suit
with
long
trousers
i
just
wanted
you
to
remember
the
boy
whispered
solemnly
that
i
nearly
sixteen
and
i
be
here
he
said
to
stand
by
her
and
i
will
the
rest
of
that
ghastly
time
was
a
blank
punctuated
by
small
quiet
orders
which
roger
obeyed
thank
god
deborah
was
there
and
she
was
attending
to
everything
but
when
at
last
it
was
over
and
roger
had
spent
the
next
day
in
his
office
had
found
it
impossible
to
work
and
so
had
gone
home
early
deborah
came
to
him
in
his
room
now
we
must
have
a
talk
she
said
allan
has
gone
through
affairs
and
there
are
still
debts
to
be
settled
it
seems
how
much
do
they
come
to
deborah
about
five
thousand
dollars
she
said
and
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
i
wish
i
could
help
you
out
she
went
on
but
i
have
nothing
saved
and
neither
has
allan
we
both
kept
using
our
money
downtown
except
just
enough
for
the
trip
abroad
and
we
need
almost
all
of
that
to
settle
for
the
funeral
i
can
manage
roger
said
and
again
there
was
a
silence
edith
will
have
to
come
here
to
live
deborah
said
presently
her
father
heavy
face
grew
stern
i
thought
of
that
he
answered
but
it
will
be
hard
on
her
deborah
i
know
it
will
but
i
do
see
anything
else
to
be
done
the
deep
quiet
voice
of
his
daughter
grew
sweet
with
pity
as
she
spoke
at
least
we
can
try
to
make
it
a
little
easier
for
her
you
can
take
her
up
to
the
mountains
and
i
can
close
her
apartment
but
of
course
she
wo
agree
to
it
unless
she
knows
how
matters
stand
deborah
waited
a
little
do
you
think
you
the
best
one
to
tell
her
yes
said
roger
after
a
pause
then
suppose
we
go
to
her
i
sleeping
up
there
for
the
next
few
nights
they
found
edith
in
her
living
room
she
had
sent
the
nurse
out
put
the
children
to
bed
and
left
alone
with
nothing
to
do
she
had
sat
facing
her
first
night
her
light
soft
hair
was
disheveled
her
pretty
features
pale
and
set
but
the
moment
roger
entered
he
saw
that
she
had
herself
in
hand
well
father
she
said
steadily
you
better
tell
me
about
our
affairs
affairs
she
corrected
herself
when
he
had
explained
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
in
a
voice
harsh
bitter
abrupt
that
will
be
hard
on
the
children
she
said
on
an
impulse
he
started
to
take
her
hand
but
she
drew
a
little
away
from
him
the
children
my
dear
he
said
huskily
will
be
taken
care
of
always
yes
and
again
she
was
silent
i
been
thinking
i
like
to
go
up
to
the
mountains
right
away
she
continued
just
our
idea
he
told
her
deborah
will
arrange
it
at
once
that
good
of
deborah
she
replied
and
after
another
pause
but
take
her
home
with
you
will
you
i
rather
not
have
her
here
i
think
she
better
stay
my
dear
all
right
in
a
tone
of
weariness
madge
deering
called
me
up
she
coming
in
town
and
she
means
to
stay
till
i
go
i
glad
he
said
approvingly
madge
had
been
a
widow
for
years
living
out
in
morristown
with
four
daughters
to
bring
up
she
had
determinedly
fought
her
way
and
had
not
only
regained
her
hold
but
had
even
grown
in
strength
and
breadth
since
the
death
of
her
husband
long
ago
i
glad
he
said
you
and
madge
he
paused
yes
we
have
a
good
deal
in
common
edith
finished
out
his
thought
you
look
tired
dad
had
you
better
go
home
now
she
suggested
after
a
moment
yes
said
roger
rising
my
child
remember
in
the
outer
hallway
he
found
deborah
with
laura
laura
had
been
here
several
times
she
was
getting
edith
mourning
there
a
love
of
a
hat
at
thurn
she
was
saying
softly
if
only
we
can
get
her
to
wear
it
it
just
her
type
and
laura
drew
an
anxious
breath
anything
she
added
to
escape
that
hideous
heavy
crepe
roger
slightly
raised
his
brows
he
noticed
a
faint
delicious
perfume
that
irritated
him
suddenly
but
glancing
again
at
his
daughter
trim
fresh
and
so
immaculate
the
joy
of
life
barely
concealed
in
her
eyes
he
stopped
and
talked
and
smiled
at
her
as
deborah
was
doing
enjoying
her
beauty
and
her
youth
her
love
and
all
her
happiness
and
though
they
spoke
of
her
sister
she
knew
they
were
thinking
of
herself
and
that
it
was
quite
right
they
should
for
it
gave
them
a
little
relief
from
their
gloom
she
was
honestly
sorry
for
edith
but
she
was
sorrier
still
for
bruce
who
she
knew
had
always
liked
her
more
than
he
would
have
cared
to
say
she
was
sorrier
for
bruce
because
while
edith
had
lost
only
her
husband
bruce
had
lost
his
very
life
and
life
meant
so
much
to
laura
these
days
the
glowing
coursing
vibrant
life
of
her
warm
beautiful
body
she
was
thinking
of
that
as
she
stood
in
the
hall
in
the
evening
at
home
in
his
study
roger
heard
a
slight
knock
at
the
door
he
looked
up
and
saw
john
may
i
come
in
gale
for
a
minute
yes
my
boy
john
hobbled
in
only
a
minute
his
voice
was
embarrassed
just
two
or
three
things
i
thought
of
he
said
the
first
was
about
your
you
see
i
was
his
stenographer
and
while
i
was
in
his
office
this
morning
helping
doctor
baird
i
found
a
good
deal
i
can
do
there
still
about
things
no
one
remembers
but
me
so
i
stay
there
awhile
if
it
all
right
only
he
paused
without
any
pay
see
what
i
mean
yes
i
see
said
roger
and
you
better
stay
in
that
way
if
you
like
thanks
said
john
then
about
his
wife
and
family
you
to
take
them
up
to
the
mountains
i
hear
and
well
before
this
happened
you
asked
up
this
summer
but
i
guess
i
better
not
i
do
think
you
be
in
the
way
my
boy
i
rather
stay
here
if
you
do
mind
when
i
through
in
your
office
i
thought
i
might
go
back
to
yours
i
could
send
you
your
mail
every
two
or
three
days
i
like
that
john
it
will
be
a
great
help
all
right
mr
gale
john
stopped
at
the
door
and
miss
deborah
he
ventured
is
she
to
get
married
just
the
same
oh
yes
i
think
so
later
on
sir
and
john
went
out
of
the
room
when
deborah
be
married
it
came
over
roger
when
he
was
alone
how
his
family
had
shifted
its
center
deborah
would
have
come
here
to
live
to
love
and
be
happy
a
mother
perhaps
but
now
she
must
find
a
home
of
her
own
in
her
place
would
come
edith
with
her
children
all
would
center
on
her
in
her
grief
and
for
no
cause
just
a
trick
of
chance
a
street
accident
and
roger
grew
bitter
and
rebelled
bruce
was
not
the
one
of
the
family
to
die
bruce
so
shrewd
and
vigorous
so
vital
the
practical
man
of
affairs
bruce
had
been
going
the
pace
that
kills
yes
roger
had
often
thought
of
it
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
if
bruce
had
died
at
fifty
say
as
a
result
of
the
life
he
had
chosen
the
fierce
exhausting
city
which
he
had
loved
as
a
man
will
love
drink
then
at
least
there
would
have
been
some
sense
of
fairness
in
it
all
if
the
town
had
let
him
alone
till
his
time
but
to
be
knocked
down
by
an
automobile
the
devilish
irony
of
it
no
reason
nothing
just
hideous
luck
well
life
was
like
that
as
for
edith
and
her
children
he
would
be
glad
to
have
them
here
only
it
would
be
different
the
house
would
have
to
change
again
he
was
sorry
too
for
deborah
no
wedding
trip
as
she
had
planned
no
home
awaiting
her
return
so
his
mind
went
over
his
family
but
suddenly
such
thoughts
fell
away
as
trivial
and
of
small
account
for
these
people
would
still
be
alive
and
bruce
was
dead
and
roger
was
old
so
he
thought
about
bruce
and
about
himself
and
all
his
children
grew
remote
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
was
there
no
other
immortality
the
clock
ticked
on
the
mantle
and
beside
it
the
thinker
brooded
down
and
roger
looked
up
unafraid
but
grim
and
gravely
wondering
chapter
xxii
but
there
was
a
rugged
practical
side
to
the
character
of
roger
gale
and
the
next
morning
he
was
ashamed
of
the
brooding
thoughts
which
had
come
in
the
night
he
shook
them
off
as
morbid
and
resolutely
set
himself
to
what
lay
close
before
him
there
was
work
to
be
done
on
bruce
affairs
and
the
work
was
a
decided
relief
madge
deering
in
the
meantime
had
offered
to
go
with
edith
and
the
children
to
the
mountains
and
see
them
all
well
settled
there
and
a
little
talk
he
had
with
madge
relieved
his
mind
still
further
what
a
recovery
had
made
from
the
tragedy
of
years
ago
how
alert
and
she
seemed
if
edith
could
only
grow
like
that
soon
after
their
departure
one
night
when
he
was
dining
alone
he
had
a
curious
consciousness
of
the
mingled
presence
of
edith
and
of
judith
his
wife
and
this
feeling
grew
so
strong
that
several
times
he
looked
about
in
a
startled
questioning
manner
all
at
once
his
eye
was
caught
by
an
old
mahogany
sideboard
it
was
edith
it
had
been
her
mother
edith
when
she
married
had
wanted
something
from
her
old
home
well
now
it
was
back
in
the
family
the
rest
of
edith
furniture
he
learned
from
deborah
that
night
had
been
stored
in
the
top
of
the
house
most
of
it
she
told
him
edith
will
probably
want
to
use
in
fitting
up
the
children
rooms
with
a
twinge
of
foreboding
roger
felt
the
approaching
change
in
his
home
when
do
you
plan
to
be
married
he
asked
about
the
end
of
august
we
could
very
well
till
then
without
hurting
poor
edith
a
little
you
see
you
know
how
she
feels
about
such
things
yes
i
guess
you
right
he
agreed
how
everything
centered
edith
he
thought
to
pay
the
debts
which
bruce
had
left
would
take
all
roger
had
on
hand
and
from
this
time
on
his
expenses
with
five
growing
children
here
would
be
a
fast
increasing
drain
he
would
have
to
be
careful
and
husband
his
strength
a
thing
he
had
always
hated
to
do
in
the
next
few
weeks
he
worked
hard
in
his
office
he
cut
down
his
smoking
stayed
home
every
evening
and
went
to
bed
at
ten
he
tried
to
shut
deborah
out
of
his
mind
as
for
laura
he
barely
gave
her
a
thought
she
dropped
in
one
evening
to
bid
him
for
this
summer
again
she
was
going
abroad
she
and
her
husband
she
told
him
were
to
motor
through
the
balkans
and
down
into
italy
her
father
gruffly
answered
that
he
hoped
she
would
enjoy
herself
it
seemed
infernally
unfair
that
it
should
not
be
deborah
who
was
sailing
the
next
morning
but
when
he
felt
himself
growing
annoyed
abruptly
he
put
a
check
on
himself
it
was
edith
he
must
think
of
now
but
curiously
it
happened
in
this
narrowing
of
his
attention
that
while
he
shut
out
two
of
his
daughters
a
mere
outsider
edged
closer
in
johnny
geer
was
a
great
help
he
was
back
in
roger
office
and
with
the
sharp
wits
he
had
gained
in
his
eighteen
years
of
fighting
for
a
chance
to
stay
alive
now
at
roger
elbow
john
was
watching
like
a
hawk
for
all
the
little
ways
and
means
of
pushing
up
the
business
what
a
will
the
lad
had
to
down
bodily
ills
what
vim
in
the
way
he
tackled
each
job
his
shrewd
and
cheery
companionship
was
a
distraction
and
relief
john
was
so
funny
sometimes
gale
he
said
as
roger
came
into
the
office
one
day
hello
johnny
how
are
you
roger
replied
fine
thank
you
and
john
went
on
with
his
work
of
opening
the
mail
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
gave
a
cackling
little
laugh
what
so
funny
roger
asked
fellers
was
the
answer
fellers
human
nature
here
a
letter
from
shifty
sam
who
the
devil
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
no
said
john
he
a
man
he
works
about
as
mean
a
graft
as
any
you
ever
heard
of
he
reads
the
in
the
papers
see
of
servant
girls
who
looking
for
work
he
makes
a
specialty
of
cooks
then
he
goes
to
where
they
live
and
talks
of
some
nice
family
that
wants
a
servant
right
away
he
claims
to
be
the
butler
and
he
dressed
to
look
the
part
ai
a
minute
to
lose
he
says
you
want
a
chawnce
my
girl
come
quick
he
says
like
a
butler
see
your
things
he
tells
her
come
right
along
with
me
so
she
packs
and
hustles
off
with
him
sam
carrying
her
suit
case
he
puts
her
on
a
trolley
and
says
guess
i
stay
on
the
platform
i
got
a
bit
of
a
headache
and
the
air
will
do
me
good
so
he
stays
out
there
with
her
suit
case
and
as
soon
as
the
car
gets
into
a
crowd
sam
jumps
and
beats
it
with
her
clothes
i
see
said
roger
dryly
but
what
he
writing
about
oh
it
ai
me
he
writing
to
it
you
was
john
serene
reply
roger
started
what
he
asked
well
said
the
boy
in
a
cautious
tone
vigilantly
eyeing
his
chief
you
see
a
lot
of
these
fellers
like
sam
have
been
in
the
papers
lately
they
being
called
a
crime
wave
well
sam
is
up
for
trial
this
week
and
half
the
irish
cooks
in
town
are
waiting
to
testify
and
shifty
seems
to
enjoy
himself
his
picture
in
the
papers
see
and
he
wants
all
the
clippings
so
he
encloses
a
five
dollar
bill
he
does
eh
well
you
write
to
sam
and
send
his
money
back
to
him
there
was
a
little
silence
but
look
here
said
john
with
keen
regret
we
had
quite
a
lot
of
these
letters
this
week
roger
wheeled
and
looked
at
him
john
he
demanded
severely
what
game
have
you
been
up
to
here
no
game
at
all
was
the
prompt
retort
just
getting
a
little
business
how
well
there
a
club
downtown
said
john
where
a
lot
of
these
petty
crooks
hang
out
i
used
to
deliver
papers
there
and
i
went
around
one
night
this
month
drum
up
business
yes
sir
roger
looked
at
him
aghast
john
he
asked
in
deep
reproach
do
you
expect
this
office
to
feed
the
vanity
of
thieves
where
the
vanity
john
rejoined
in
being
called
a
crime
wave
and
seeing
the
sudden
tremor
of
mirth
which
had
appeared
on
roger
face
look
here
gale
he
went
eagerly
on
when
every
paper
in
the
town
is
telling
these
fellers
where
they
belong
calling
crooks
degenerates
and
preaching
regular
sermons
right
into
their
faces
why
should
we
help
to
read
the
stuff
how
do
we
know
it
wo
do
good
it
church
to
that
what
it
is
and
business
for
this
office
nine
of
these
guys
have
sent
in
their
money
just
in
the
last
week
or
so
look
out
my
boy
said
roger
with
slow
and
solemn
emphasis
if
you
are
extremely
careful
you
find
yourself
a
millionaire
but
wait
a
minute
gale
not
in
this
office
roger
said
send
back
every
one
of
understand
yes
sir
was
the
meek
reply
and
with
a
little
sigh
of
regret
john
turned
his
wits
to
other
kinds
and
conditions
of
new
yorkers
who
might
care
to
see
themselves
in
print
as
they
worked
together
day
by
day
roger
had
occasional
qualms
over
leaving
john
here
in
the
hot
town
while
he
himself
went
up
to
the
mountains
he
even
thought
of
writing
to
edith
that
he
was
planning
to
bring
john
too
but
no
she
would
like
it
so
he
did
something
else
instead
john
he
said
one
morning
i
going
to
raise
your
salary
to
a
hundred
dollars
a
month
instantly
from
the
lad
bright
eyes
there
shot
a
look
of
triumph
thanks
gale
was
his
hearty
response
and
in
the
meantime
johnny
i
want
you
to
take
a
good
solid
month
off
all
right
sir
thank
you
john
replied
but
i
guess
it
wo
be
quite
a
month
i
do
feel
as
if
i
needed
it
the
next
day
at
the
office
he
appeared
resplendent
in
a
suit
of
clothes
a
summer
homespun
of
light
gray
set
off
by
a
tie
of
flaming
red
there
was
nothing
soft
about
that
boy
no
johnny
knew
how
to
look
out
for
himself
and
roger
went
up
to
the
farm
chapter
xxiii
george
met
him
at
the
station
as
he
had
done
a
year
before
but
at
once
roger
noticed
a
difference
in
the
short
time
since
his
father
death
certain
lines
had
come
in
the
boy
freckled
face
and
they
gave
him
a
thoughtful
resolute
look
george
voice
was
changing
one
moment
it
was
high
and
boyish
again
a
deep
and
manly
bass
as
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
horses
and
talked
about
his
mother
his
grandfather
from
time
to
time
threw
curious
side
glances
oh
yes
george
was
saying
mother
all
right
she
doing
fine
it
was
pretty
bad
at
first
though
she
would
let
me
sit
up
with
her
any
she
treated
me
like
a
regular
kid
but
any
fellow
with
any
sense
could
see
how
she
was
feeling
she
get
thinking
of
the
accident
george
stopped
short
and
clamped
his
jaws
you
know
my
dad
did
a
wonderful
thing
he
continued
presently
even
when
he
was
dying
and
mother
and
i
were
there
by
his
bed
he
remembered
how
she
get
thinking
alone
all
about
the
accident
you
see
he
knew
mother
pretty
darned
well
so
he
told
her
to
remember
that
he
was
the
one
to
blame
for
it
if
it
had
been
for
him
he
said
they
would
have
gone
home
in
the
taxi
that
a
pretty
good
point
to
keep
in
her
mind
do
you
think
so
he
inquired
and
roger
glanced
affectionately
into
the
anxious
face
by
his
side
yes
he
said
it
a
mighty
good
point
did
you
think
of
it
yes
sir
george
replied
i
told
it
to
her
a
good
many
times
that
and
two
other
points
i
thought
of
what
are
they
son
asked
roger
first
the
boy
said
awkwardly
about
how
good
she
was
to
him
and
second
that
she
let
him
buy
the
new
car
before
he
died
he
had
such
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
that
car
on
the
last
words
the
lad
changing
voice
went
from
an
impressive
bass
to
a
most
undignified
treble
he
savagely
scowled
those
three
points
he
continued
in
more
careful
measured
tones
were
about
all
i
could
think
of
i
had
to
use
over
and
over
on
mother
when
things
got
bad
i
mean
a
flush
of
embarrassment
came
on
his
face
and
hold
her
and
kiss
her
he
muttered
then
he
whipped
his
horses
we
had
some
pretty
bad
times
this
month
he
continued
loud
and
manfully
you
see
mother
is
so
young
as
she
was
she
well
on
in
her
thirties
a
glimmer
of
amusement
appeared
in
roger
heavy
eyes
but
she
do
cry
often
any
more
and
with
you
here
we
pull
her
through
he
shot
a
quick
look
at
his
grandfather
gee
but
i
glad
you
here
he
said
so
am
i
said
roger
and
with
a
little
pressure
of
his
hand
on
shoulder
i
guess
you
had
about
your
share
now
tell
me
the
news
how
are
things
on
the
farm
with
a
breath
of
evident
relief
the
lad
launched
into
the
animal
world
and
soon
he
was
talking
eagerly
in
the
next
few
days
with
his
daughter
roger
found
that
george
was
right
she
had
been
through
the
worst
of
it
but
she
still
had
her
reactions
her
spells
of
emptiness
bleak
despair
her
moods
of
fierce
rebellion
or
of
sudden
for
not
having
given
bruce
more
while
he
lived
and
in
such
hours
her
father
tried
to
comfort
her
with
poor
success
remember
child
i
with
you
and
i
know
how
it
feels
he
said
i
went
through
it
all
myself
when
your
mother
died
but
mother
was
so
much
older
he
looked
at
his
daughter
compassionately
how
old
are
you
he
inquired
your
mother
was
he
replied
and
at
that
edith
turned
and
stared
at
him
bewildered
shocked
brought
face
to
face
with
a
new
and
momentous
fact
in
her
life
mother
only
my
age
when
she
died
yes
said
roger
gently
only
three
years
older
with
a
twinge
of
pain
he
noticed
two
quite
visible
streaks
of
gray
in
his
daughter
soft
blonde
hair
and
she
felt
as
you
do
now
as
though
she
were
just
starting
out
and
i
felt
the
same
way
my
dear
if
i
not
mistaken
everyone
does
you
still
feel
young
but
the
new
generation
is
already
growing
up
and
you
can
feel
yourself
being
pushed
on
and
it
is
hard
it
is
very
hard
clumsily
he
took
her
hand
do
let
yourself
drop
out
he
said
be
as
your
mother
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
left
instead
of
me
go
straight
on
with
your
children
to
this
note
he
could
feel
her
respond
and
at
first
as
he
felt
what
a
fight
she
was
making
roger
glorified
her
pluck
as
he
watched
her
with
her
children
at
table
smiling
at
their
talk
with
an
evident
effort
to
enter
in
and
again
with
her
baby
snug
in
her
lap
while
she
read
bedtime
stories
to
bob
and
little
tad
at
her
side
he
kept
noticing
the
resemblance
between
his
daughter
and
his
wife
how
close
were
these
two
members
of
his
family
drawing
together
now
one
of
them
living
the
other
dead
but
later
as
the
weeks
wore
on
she
began
to
plan
for
her
children
she
planned
precisely
how
to
fit
them
all
into
the
house
in
town
she
planned
the
hours
for
their
meals
for
their
going
alone
or
with
the
nurse
or
a
maid
to
their
different
private
schools
to
music
lessons
to
dancing
school
and
uptown
to
the
park
to
play
she
planned
their
fall
clothes
and
she
planned
their
friends
and
there
came
to
her
father
occasional
moods
of
anxiety
he
remembered
bruce
grim
remarks
about
those
simple
schools
and
clothes
the
kind
that
always
cost
the
most
and
he
began
to
realize
what
bruce
existence
must
have
been
for
scarcely
ever
in
their
talks
did
edith
speak
of
anything
outside
of
her
family
night
after
night
with
a
tensity
born
of
her
struggle
with
her
grief
she
talked
about
her
children
and
roger
was
in
bruce
place
he
was
the
one
she
planned
with
at
moments
with
a
vague
dismay
he
glimpsed
the
life
ahead
in
his
home
george
was
hard
at
work
each
day
down
by
the
broken
dam
at
the
mill
he
had
an
idea
he
could
patch
it
up
put
the
old
back
into
place
and
make
it
run
a
dynamo
by
which
he
could
light
the
house
and
barn
and
run
the
machines
in
the
dairy
in
his
new
rôle
as
the
man
of
his
family
george
was
planning
out
his
career
he
was
wrestling
with
a
book
entitled
our
new
mother
earth
and
a
journal
called
the
modern
farm
and
to
roger
he
confided
that
he
meant
to
be
a
farmer
he
wanted
to
go
in
the
autumn
to
the
state
agricultural
college
but
when
one
day
very
cautiously
roger
spoke
to
edith
of
this
with
a
hard
and
jealous
smile
which
quite
transformed
her
features
she
said
oh
i
know
all
about
that
father
dear
it
just
a
stage
he
going
through
and
it
the
same
way
with
elizabeth
too
and
her
crazy
idea
of
becoming
a
doctor
she
took
that
from
allan
baird
and
george
took
his
from
deborah
they
get
over
it
soon
enough
they
wo
get
over
it
roger
cried
their
dreams
are
parts
of
something
new
something
i
quite
vague
about
but
some
of
it
has
come
to
stay
you
losing
all
your
chances
just
as
i
did
years
ago
you
never
know
your
children
but
he
uttered
this
cry
to
himself
alone
outwardly
he
only
frowned
and
edith
had
gone
on
to
say
i
do
hope
that
deborah
wo
come
up
this
summer
she
been
very
good
and
kind
of
course
and
if
she
comes
she
be
doing
it
entirely
on
my
account
but
i
do
want
her
here
i
want
her
to
marry
the
sooner
the
better
and
come
to
her
senses
be
happy
i
mean
and
i
wish
you
would
tell
her
so
within
a
few
days
after
this
deborah
wrote
to
her
father
that
she
was
coming
the
next
week
he
said
nothing
to
edith
about
it
at
first
he
had
william
saddled
and
went
for
a
ride
to
try
to
determine
what
he
should
do
but
it
was
a
ticklish
business
for
women
were
queer
and
touchy
and
once
more
he
felt
the
working
of
those
uncanny
family
ties
deborah
he
reflected
is
coming
up
here
because
she
feels
it
selfish
of
her
to
stay
away
if
she
marries
at
once
as
she
told
me
herself
she
thinks
edith
will
be
hurt
edith
wo
be
hurt
and
if
deborah
comes
there
be
trouble
every
minute
she
stays
but
can
i
tell
her
so
not
at
all
i
ca
say
not
wanted
here
if
i
do
be
hurt
oh
lord
these
girls
and
deborah
knows
very
well
that
if
she
does
get
married
this
month
with
laura
abroad
and
edith
up
here
and
only
me
at
the
wedding
edith
will
smile
to
herself
and
say
is
that
just
like
deborah
as
roger
slowly
rode
along
a
steep
and
winding
mountain
road
gloomily
he
reflected
to
what
petty
little
troubles
a
family
of
women
could
descend
so
soon
after
death
itself
and
he
lifted
his
eyes
up
to
the
hills
and
decided
to
leave
this
matter
alone
if
women
would
be
women
let
them
settle
their
own
affairs
deborah
was
due
to
arrive
on
the
following
friday
evening
all
right
let
her
come
he
thought
she
would
soon
see
she
was
in
the
way
and
then
in
a
little
affectionate
talk
he
would
suggest
that
she
marry
right
off
and
have
a
decent
honeymoon
before
the
school
year
opened
so
he
dismissed
it
from
his
mind
and
as
he
listened
in
the
dusk
to
the
numberless
murmuring
voices
of
living
creatures
large
and
small
which
rose
out
of
the
valley
and
as
from
high
above
him
the
serenity
of
the
mountains
there
towering
over
thousands
of
years
stole
into
his
spirit
roger
had
a
large
quieting
sense
of
something
high
and
powerful
looking
down
upon
the
earth
a
sense
of
all
humanity
honeycombed
with
millions
upon
millions
of
small
sorrows
absorbing
joys
and
hopes
and
fears
and
in
spite
of
them
all
the
great
life
sweeping
on
with
no
great
death
to
check
its
course
no
immense
catastrophe
all
these
little
troubles
like
mere
tiny
specks
of
foam
upon
the
surface
of
the
tide
deborah
visit
the
following
week
was
as
he
had
expected
within
an
hour
after
her
coming
he
could
feel
the
tension
grow
deborah
herself
was
tense
both
from
the
work
she
had
left
in
new
york
where
she
was
soon
to
have
five
schools
and
from
the
thought
of
her
marriage
only
a
few
weeks
ahead
she
said
nothing
about
it
however
until
as
a
sisterly
duty
edith
tried
to
draw
her
out
by
showing
an
interest
in
her
plans
but
the
cloud
of
death
was
there
and
deborah
shunned
the
topic
she
tried
to
talk
of
the
children
instead
but
edith
at
once
was
on
the
defensive
vigilant
for
trouble
and
as
she
unfolded
her
winter
plans
she
grew
distinctly
brief
and
curt
if
deborah
does
see
it
now
she
a
fool
her
father
told
himself
i
just
wait
a
few
days
more
and
then
we
have
that
little
talk
chapter
xxiv
it
had
rained
so
hard
for
the
past
two
days
that
no
one
had
gone
to
the
village
which
was
nearly
three
miles
from
the
farm
but
when
the
storm
was
over
at
last
george
and
elizabeth
tramped
down
and
came
back
at
dusk
with
a
bag
full
of
mail
their
clothes
were
and
they
hurried
upstairs
to
change
before
supper
while
roger
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
spread
open
his
new
york
paper
it
was
july
from
a
habit
grown
out
of
thirty
odd
years
of
business
life
roger
read
his
paper
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
by
instinct
his
eye
swept
the
page
for
news
dealing
with
individual
men
for
it
was
upon
people
names
in
print
that
he
had
made
his
living
and
so
when
he
looked
at
this
strange
front
page
it
gave
him
a
swift
twinge
of
alarm
for
the
news
was
not
of
men
but
of
nations
austria
was
massing
her
troops
along
the
serbian
frontier
and
germany
italy
russia
france
and
even
england
all
were
in
a
turmoil
with
panics
in
their
capitals
money
markets
going
wild
edith
came
down
in
her
neat
black
dress
with
its
narrow
white
collar
ready
for
supper
she
glanced
at
her
father
why
what
the
matter
look
at
this
and
he
tossed
her
a
paper
she
murmured
softly
oh
how
frightful
that
would
be
and
she
read
on
with
lips
compressed
but
soon
there
came
from
a
room
upstairs
the
sudden
cry
of
one
of
her
children
followed
by
a
shrill
wail
of
distress
and
dropping
the
paper
she
hurried
away
roger
continued
his
reading
deborah
came
she
saw
the
paper
edith
had
dropped
picked
it
up
and
sat
down
to
read
and
there
were
a
few
moments
of
absolute
silence
then
roger
heard
a
quivering
breath
and
glancing
up
he
saw
deborah
eyes
intent
and
startled
moving
down
the
columns
of
print
in
a
swift
uncomprehending
way
pretty
serious
business
he
growled
it
ca
happen
she
exclaimed
and
they
resumed
their
reading
in
the
next
three
days
as
they
read
the
news
they
felt
war
like
a
whirlpool
sucking
in
all
their
powers
to
think
or
feel
felt
their
own
small
personal
plans
whirled
about
like
leaves
in
a
storm
and
while
their
minds
at
first
dazed
and
stunned
by
the
thought
of
such
appalling
armies
battles
death
and
desolation
slowly
cleared
and
they
strove
to
think
and
roger
thought
of
business
shivered
to
atoms
in
every
land
and
deborah
thought
of
schools
by
thousands
all
over
europe
closing
down
in
cities
and
in
villages
in
valleys
and
on
mountain
sides
of
homes
in
panic
everywhere
of
all
ideals
of
brotherhood
shaken
bending
tottering
war
broke
out
in
europe
what
is
this
going
to
mean
to
me
millions
of
people
were
asking
that
and
so
did
roger
and
deborah
the
same
night
they
left
for
new
york
while
edith
with
a
sigh
of
relief
settled
back
into
her
family
the
next
morning
at
his
office
roger
found
john
waiting
with
misery
stamped
on
his
face
john
had
paid
small
heed
to
war
barely
stopping
for
sleep
in
the
last
two
days
he
had
gone
through
scores
and
hundreds
of
papers
angrily
skipping
all
those
names
of
kings
and
emperors
and
czars
and
searching
instead
for
american
names
names
of
patrons
business
gone
each
hour
he
had
been
opening
mail
and
piling
up
letters
cancelling
contracts
ordering
service
discontinued
roger
sat
down
at
his
desk
as
he
worked
and
figured
and
dictated
letters
glancing
into
the
outer
rooms
he
saw
the
long
rows
of
girls
at
tables
obviously
trying
to
pretend
that
there
was
work
for
them
to
do
he
felt
them
anxiously
watching
him
as
in
other
offices
everywhere
millions
of
other
employees
kept
furtively
glancing
at
their
chiefs
war
he
thought
shall
i
close
he
shrank
from
what
it
would
mean
to
those
girls
business
will
pick
up
again
soon
a
few
days
weeks
that
all
i
need
and
he
went
to
his
bank
no
credit
there
he
tried
other
sources
all
he
could
think
of
racking
his
brains
as
he
went
about
town
but
still
he
could
not
raise
a
loan
finally
he
went
to
the
firm
which
had
once
held
a
mortgage
on
his
house
the
chief
partner
had
been
close
to
bruce
an
old
college
friend
and
when
even
this
friend
refused
him
aid
it
a
question
of
bruce
children
roger
muttered
reddening
he
felt
like
a
beggar
but
he
was
getting
desperate
the
younger
man
had
looked
away
and
was
nervously
tapping
his
desk
with
his
pen
bad
as
that
eh
he
answered
then
i
guess
it
got
to
be
done
he
looked
anxiously
up
at
roger
who
just
at
that
moment
appeared
very
old
do
worry
gale
he
said
somehow
or
other
we
carry
you
through
thank
you
sir
roger
rose
heavily
feeling
weak
and
took
his
departure
this
is
war
he
told
himself
and
i
got
to
look
after
my
own
but
he
had
a
sensation
almost
of
guilt
as
upon
his
return
to
his
office
he
saw
those
suddenly
watchful
faces
he
walked
past
them
and
went
into
his
room
and
again
he
searched
for
ways
and
means
he
tried
to
see
his
business
as
it
would
be
that
autumn
to
see
the
city
the
nation
the
world
as
it
would
be
in
the
months
ahead
repeatedly
he
fought
off
his
fears
but
slowly
and
inexorably
the
sense
of
his
helplessness
grew
clear
no
i
must
shut
down
he
thought
on
his
way
home
that
evening
in
a
crush
at
a
turbulent
corner
he
saw
a
big
truck
jam
into
a
taxi
and
with
a
throb
of
rebellion
he
thought
of
his
who
was
dead
just
the
turn
of
a
hair
and
bruce
might
have
lived
and
been
here
to
look
after
the
children
at
the
prospect
of
the
crisis
the
strain
he
saw
before
him
roger
again
felt
weak
and
old
he
shook
off
his
dread
and
strode
angrily
on
in
his
house
the
rooms
downstairs
were
still
dismantled
for
the
summer
there
was
emptiness
and
silence
but
no
serenity
in
them
now
only
the
quiet
before
the
storm
which
he
could
feel
from
far
and
near
was
gathering
about
his
home
he
heard
deborah
on
the
floor
above
and
went
up
and
found
her
making
his
bed
for
the
chambermaid
had
not
yet
come
her
voice
was
a
little
unnatural
it
has
been
a
hard
day
has
it
i
got
your
ready
she
said
do
you
want
a
nice
cool
bath
supper
will
be
ready
soon
when
a
half
hour
later
somewhat
refreshed
roger
came
down
to
the
table
he
noticed
it
was
set
for
two
is
allan
coming
he
asked
her
mobile
features
tightened
not
till
later
she
replied
they
talked
little
and
the
meal
was
short
but
afterwards
on
the
wooden
porch
deborah
turned
to
her
father
now
tell
me
about
your
office
she
said
there
not
enough
business
to
pay
the
rent
that
wo
last
i
not
so
sure
i
am
she
said
determinedly
her
father
slowly
turned
his
head
are
you
with
this
war
he
asked
her
eyes
met
his
and
moved
away
in
a
baffled
searching
manner
she
has
troubles
of
her
own
he
thought
how
much
can
we
run
the
house
on
deborah
he
asked
her
at
first
she
did
not
answer
what
was
it
about
six
thousand
last
year
i
think
so
she
said
restlessly
we
can
cut
down
on
that
of
course
with
edith
and
the
children
here
edith
will
have
to
manage
it
there
are
others
to
be
thought
of
the
children
in
your
schools
you
mean
yes
she
answered
with
a
frown
it
will
be
a
bad
year
for
the
tenements
but
please
go
on
and
tell
me
what
have
you
thought
of
doing
mortgage
the
house
again
he
replied
it
has
been
easy
for
money
is
tight
but
i
think
i
be
able
to
get
enough
to
just
about
carry
us
through
the
year
at
home
i
mean
he
added
and
the
office
shut
down
he
said
she
turned
on
him
fiercely
you
wo
do
that
what
else
can
i
do
turn
all
those
girls
away
she
cried
at
her
tone
his
look
grew
troubled
how
can
i
help
myself
deborah
if
i
kept
open
it
would
cost
me
over
five
hundred
a
week
to
run
have
i
five
hundred
dollars
a
week
to
lose
but
i
tell
you
it
wo
last
she
cried
and
again
the
baffled
driven
expression
swept
over
her
expressive
face
ca
you
see
this
is
only
a
panic
and
keep
going
somehow
ca
you
see
what
it
means
to
the
tenements
hundreds
of
thousands
are
out
of
work
they
being
turned
off
every
day
every
hour
employers
all
over
are
losing
their
heads
and
city
hall
is
as
mad
as
the
rest
they
decided
already
down
there
to
retrench
he
turned
with
a
quick
jerk
of
his
head
are
they
cutting
you
down
she
set
her
teeth
yes
they
are
but
the
work
in
my
schools
is
going
on
every
bit
of
it
is
for
every
child
i
going
to
find
a
way
she
said
and
he
felt
a
thrill
of
compassion
i
sorry
to
hear
it
he
muttered
you
need
be
she
paused
a
moment
smiled
and
went
on
in
a
quieter
voice
do
think
i
blind
i
sensible
i
see
you
ca
lose
five
hundred
a
week
but
why
not
try
what
other
employers
quite
a
few
have
decided
to
do
call
your
people
together
explain
how
it
is
and
ask
them
to
choose
a
committee
to
help
you
find
which
ones
need
jobs
the
most
keep
all
you
can
on
part
time
of
course
but
at
least
pay
them
something
carry
them
through
you
lose
money
by
it
i
have
a
doubt
but
already
found
you
can
mortgage
the
house
and
remember
besides
that
i
shall
be
here
i
not
going
to
marry
now
her
father
looked
at
her
quickly
and
of
course
i
expect
to
do
my
share
toward
meeting
the
expenses
moreover
i
know
we
can
cut
down
retrench
said
roger
grimly
turn
off
the
servants
instead
of
the
clerks
no
only
one
of
them
martha
upstairs
and
she
is
to
be
married
keep
the
cook
and
the
waitress
edith
will
have
to
give
up
her
nurse
and
it
will
be
hard
on
her
of
course
but
she
have
to
realize
this
is
war
deborah
said
sharply
besides
she
urged
it
not
going
to
last
business
everywhere
will
pick
up
in
a
few
weeks
or
months
at
most
the
war
go
on
it
too
horribly
big
she
broke
off
and
anxiously
looked
at
him
her
father
was
still
frowning
i
asking
you
to
risk
a
good
deal
she
continued
her
voice
intense
and
low
but
somehow
dearie
i
always
feel
that
this
old
house
of
ours
is
strong
it
can
a
good
deal
we
can
all
of
us
stand
so
much
as
soon
as
we
know
we
have
to
the
lines
of
her
wide
sensitive
mouth
tightened
firmly
once
again
it
all
so
vague
and
uncertain
i
know
but
one
thing
at
least
is
sure
this
is
no
time
for
people
with
money
no
matter
how
little
to
shut
themselves
up
in
their
own
little
houses
and
let
the
rest
starve
or
beg
or
steal
this
is
the
time
to
do
our
share
and
she
waited
but
he
made
no
reply
every
nation
at
war
is
doing
it
dad
become
like
one
big
family
with
everyone
helping
doing
his
share
must
a
nation
be
at
war
to
do
that
ca
we
be
brothers
without
the
guns
ca
you
see
that
we
all
of
us
stunned
and
trying
to
see
what
war
will
mean
to
all
the
children
in
the
world
and
while
we
groping
groping
ca
we
give
each
other
a
hand
still
he
sat
motionless
there
in
the
dark
at
last
he
stirred
heavily
in
his
chair
i
guess
you
right
he
told
her
at
least
i
think
it
over
and
try
to
work
out
something
along
the
lines
you
spoke
of
again
there
was
a
silence
then
his
daughter
turned
to
him
with
a
little
deprecating
smile
you
forgive
my
preaching
to
you
dad
no
preaching
he
said
gruffly
just
ordinary
common
sense
a
little
later
allan
came
in
and
roger
soon
left
them
and
went
to
bed
alone
with
baird
she
was
silent
a
moment
well
have
you
thought
it
over
she
asked
was
i
right
in
what
i
said
at
the
anxious
ring
in
her
low
clear
voice
leaning
over
he
took
her
hand
and
he
felt
it
hot
and
trembling
as
it
quickly
closed
on
his
he
stroked
it
slowly
soothingly
in
the
he
seemed
doubly
tall
and
powerful
yes
i
sure
you
were
right
he
said
spring
at
the
latest
i
marry
you
then
her
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
his
come
here
she
whispered
sharply
and
baird
bent
over
and
held
her
tight
tighter
she
whispered
tighter
there
i
said
spring
at
the
latest
i
ca
lose
you
allan
now
she
suddenly
quivered
as
though
from
fatigue
i
going
to
watch
you
close
down
there
he
said
in
a
moment
huskily
chapter
xxv
roger
saw
little
of
deborah
in
the
weeks
that
followed
she
was
gathering
her
forces
for
the
long
struggle
she
saw
ahead
and
his
own
worries
filled
his
mind
on
his
house
he
succeeded
in
borrowing
five
thousand
dollars
at
ten
per
cent
and
in
his
office
he
worked
out
a
scheme
along
the
lines
of
deborah
plan
at
first
it
was
only
a
struggle
to
save
the
remnants
of
what
was
left
later
the
tide
began
to
turn
new
business
came
into
the
office
again
but
only
a
little
and
then
it
stopped
hard
times
were
here
for
the
winter
soon
edith
would
come
with
the
children
he
wondered
how
sensible
she
would
be
it
was
going
to
mean
a
daily
fight
to
make
ends
meet
he
told
himself
and
guiltily
he
decided
not
to
let
his
daughter
know
how
matters
stood
in
his
office
take
care
of
your
own
flesh
and
blood
and
then
be
generous
as
you
please
that
had
always
been
his
way
and
now
deborah
had
upset
it
by
her
emotional
appeal
how
dramatic
she
is
at
times
he
reflected
in
annoyance
just
lets
herself
out
and
enjoys
herself
he
grew
angry
at
her
interference
and
more
than
once
he
resolved
to
shut
down
but
back
in
the
office
before
those
watchful
faces
still
again
he
would
put
it
off
wait
a
little
we
see
he
thought
in
the
meantime
in
this
interplay
these
shifting
lights
and
shadows
which
played
upon
the
history
of
the
life
of
roger
home
there
came
to
him
a
diversion
from
an
unexpected
source
laura
and
harold
returned
from
abroad
soon
after
landing
they
came
to
the
house
and
talking
fast
and
eagerly
they
told
how
they
had
eluded
the
war
for
them
it
had
been
a
glorious
game
in
venice
in
early
august
harold
had
seen
a
chance
for
a
big
stroke
of
business
he
had
a
friend
who
lived
in
rome
an
italian
close
to
his
government
at
once
they
had
joined
forces
worked
day
and
night
pulled
wires
used
money
judiciously
here
and
there
and
so
had
secured
large
orders
for
munitions
from
the
then
to
get
back
to
god
country
there
came
the
hitch
they
were
too
late
naples
genoa
and
milan
all
were
filled
with
tourist
mobs
they
took
a
train
for
paris
and
reaching
the
city
just
a
week
before
the
end
of
the
german
drive
they
found
it
worse
than
italy
but
there
hal
had
a
special
pull
and
by
the
use
of
those
wits
of
his
not
to
be
downed
by
refusals
he
got
passage
at
last
for
laura
himself
and
his
new
italian
partner
at
midnight
making
their
way
across
the
city
and
at
the
station
struggling
through
a
wild
and
half
crazed
multitude
of
men
and
women
and
children
they
boarded
a
train
and
went
rushing
westward
right
along
the
edge
of
the
storm
to
the
north
the
germans
were
so
close
that
laura
was
sure
she
could
hear
the
big
guns
the
train
kept
stopping
to
take
on
troops
at
dawn
some
twenty
wounded
men
came
crowding
into
their
very
car
bloody
and
dirty
pale
and
worn
but
gaily
smiling
at
the
pain
and
saying
ça
rien
madame
later
harold
opened
his
flask
for
some
splendid
breton
soldier
boys
just
going
into
action
and
they
stood
up
with
flashing
eyes
and
shouted
out
the
marseillaise
while
laura
shivered
and
thrilled
with
delight
i
nearly
kissed
them
all
she
cried
roger
greatly
enjoyed
the
evening
he
had
heard
so
much
of
the
horrors
of
war
here
was
something
different
something
bright
and
vibrant
with
youth
and
adventure
here
at
last
was
the
thrill
of
war
the
part
he
had
always
read
about
he
glanced
now
and
then
at
deborah
and
was
annoyed
by
what
he
saw
for
although
she
said
nothing
and
forced
a
smile
he
could
easily
tell
by
the
set
of
her
lips
that
deborah
thoroughly
disapproved
all
right
that
was
her
way
he
thought
but
this
was
laura
way
shedding
the
gloom
and
the
tragic
side
as
a
duck
will
shed
water
off
its
back
a
duck
with
bright
new
plumage
fresh
from
the
shops
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
and
taking
some
pleasure
out
of
life
what
an
ardent
gleaming
beauty
she
was
he
thought
as
he
watched
this
daughter
of
his
and
underneath
his
enjoyment
too
though
roger
would
not
have
admitted
it
was
a
sense
of
relief
in
the
news
that
at
least
one
man
in
the
family
was
growing
rich
instead
of
poor
already
hal
and
his
partner
a
fascinating
creature
according
to
description
were
fast
equipping
shrapnel
mills
plainly
they
expected
a
tremendous
rush
of
business
and
no
matter
how
you
felt
about
war
the
word
profits
at
least
had
a
pleasant
sound
how
has
the
war
hit
you
sir
harold
asked
his
oh
i
get
on
my
boy
was
roger
quiet
answer
for
harold
was
not
quite
the
kind
he
would
ever
like
to
ask
for
aid
still
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
he
would
have
someone
to
turn
to
long
after
they
had
left
the
house
he
kept
thinking
over
all
they
had
said
what
an
amazing
time
they
had
had
the
two
young
scalawags
deborah
was
still
in
the
room
as
she
sat
working
at
her
desk
her
back
was
turned
and
she
did
not
speak
but
little
by
little
her
father
mood
changed
of
course
she
was
right
he
admitted
for
now
they
were
gone
the
spell
they
had
cast
was
losing
a
part
of
its
glamor
yes
their
talk
had
been
pretty
raw
sheer
unthinking
selfishness
a
bold
rush
for
plunder
and
a
dash
to
get
away
trampling
over
people
half
crazed
women
and
children
in
panicky
crowds
and
leaving
behind
them
so
to
speak
laura
joyous
rippling
laugh
over
their
own
success
in
the
game
yes
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
hal
was
rushing
headlong
into
a
savage
dangerous
game
a
scramble
and
a
gamble
with
adventurers
from
all
over
europe
gathering
here
and
making
a
little
world
of
their
own
he
would
work
and
live
at
a
feverish
pitch
and
laura
would
go
it
as
hard
as
he
roger
thought
he
could
see
their
winter
ahead
how
they
would
pile
up
money
and
spend
all
at
once
as
though
some
figure
silent
and
invisible
were
standing
close
beside
him
from
far
back
in
his
childhood
a
memory
flashed
into
his
mind
of
a
keen
and
clear
october
night
when
roger
a
little
shaver
of
nine
had
stood
with
his
mother
in
front
of
the
farmhouse
and
listened
to
the
faint
sharp
roll
of
a
single
drum
far
down
in
the
valley
and
his
mother
grip
had
hurt
his
hand
and
a
lump
had
risen
in
his
throat
as
dan
his
oldest
brother
had
marched
away
with
his
company
of
new
hampshire
mountain
boys
we
are
coming
father
abraham
three
hundred
thousand
more
dan
had
been
killed
at
shiloh
and
it
must
be
like
that
now
in
france
no
he
did
not
like
the
look
which
he
had
seen
on
laura
face
as
she
had
talked
about
the
war
and
the
fat
profits
to
be
made
was
this
all
we
yankees
had
to
say
to
the
people
over
in
europe
frowning
and
glancing
at
deborah
back
he
saw
that
she
was
tired
it
was
nearly
midnight
but
still
she
kept
working
doggedly
on
moving
her
shoulder
muscles
at
times
as
though
to
shake
off
aches
and
pains
then
bending
again
to
her
labor
her
fight
against
such
heavy
odds
in
the
winter
just
beginning
for
those
children
in
the
tenements
he
recalled
a
fragment
of
the
appeal
she
had
made
to
him
only
the
month
before
ca
you
see
that
we
all
of
us
stunned
and
trying
to
see
what
war
will
mean
to
all
the
children
in
the
world
and
while
we
groping
groping
ca
we
give
each
other
a
hand
and
as
he
looked
at
his
daughter
she
made
him
think
of
her
grandmother
as
she
had
so
often
done
before
for
deborah
too
was
a
pioneer
she
too
had
lived
in
the
wilderness
clearing
roads
through
jungles
yes
and
freeing
slaves
of
ignorance
and
building
a
nation
of
new
men
and
now
she
was
doggedly
fighting
to
save
what
she
had
builded
not
from
the
raids
of
the
indians
but
from
the
ravages
of
this
war
which
was
sweeping
civilization
aside
with
her
school
behind
her
so
to
speak
she
stood
facing
this
great
enemy
with
stern
and
angry
steady
eyes
her
pioneer
grandmother
come
to
life
so
with
the
deep
craving
which
was
a
part
of
his
inmost
self
roger
tried
to
bind
together
what
was
old
and
what
was
new
but
his
thoughts
grew
vague
and
drifting
he
realized
how
weary
he
was
and
said
and
went
to
bed
there
just
before
he
fell
asleep
again
he
had
a
feeling
of
relief
at
the
knowledge
that
one
at
least
in
the
family
was
to
be
rich
this
year
with
a
guilty
sensation
he
shook
off
the
thought
and
within
a
few
moments
after
that
his
harsh
regular
breathing
was
heard
in
the
room
chapter
xxvi
it
was
only
a
few
days
later
that
edith
arrived
with
her
children
roger
met
her
at
the
train
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
fast
mountain
express
of
the
summer
had
been
taken
off
some
time
before
so
edith
had
had
to
be
up
at
dawn
and
to
change
cars
several
times
on
the
trip
she
be
worn
out
he
thought
as
he
waited
the
train
was
late
as
he
walked
about
the
new
station
that
monstrous
sparkling
hive
of
travel
with
its
huge
halls
and
passageways
its
little
village
of
shops
underground
and
its
bewildering
levels
for
trains
he
remembered
the
interest
bruce
had
shown
in
watching
this
immense
puzzle
worked
out
the
day
and
night
labor
year
after
year
without
the
stopping
of
a
train
this
mighty
symbol
of
the
times
of
all
the
glorious
power
and
speed
in
an
age
that
had
been
as
the
breath
to
his
nostrils
how
bruce
had
loved
the
city
as
roger
paced
slowly
back
and
forth
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
there
came
over
his
heavy
visage
a
look
of
affection
and
regret
which
made
even
new
yorkers
glance
at
him
as
they
went
nervously
bustling
by
from
time
to
time
he
smiled
to
himself
the
catskills
will
be
central
park
all
this
city
needs
is
speed
but
suddenly
he
remembered
that
bruce
had
always
been
here
before
to
meet
his
wife
and
children
and
that
edith
on
her
approaching
train
must
be
dreading
her
arrival
and
when
at
last
the
train
rolled
in
and
he
spied
her
shapely
little
head
in
the
throng
of
travellers
roger
saw
by
her
set
steady
smile
and
the
strained
expression
on
her
face
that
he
had
guessed
right
with
a
quick
surge
of
compassion
he
pressed
forward
kissed
her
awkwardly
squeezed
her
arm
then
hastily
greeted
the
children
and
hurried
away
to
see
to
the
trunks
that
much
of
it
was
over
and
to
his
relief
when
they
reached
the
house
edith
busied
herself
at
once
in
helping
the
nurse
put
the
children
to
bed
later
he
came
up
and
told
her
that
he
had
had
a
light
supper
prepared
thank
you
dear
she
answered
it
was
so
thoughtful
in
you
but
i
too
tired
to
eat
anything
and
then
with
a
little
assuring
smile
i
be
all
right
i
going
to
bed
child
get
a
fine
long
sleep
and
roger
went
down
to
his
study
feeling
they
had
made
a
good
start
what
has
become
of
martha
edith
asked
her
father
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
she
left
last
month
to
be
married
he
said
and
deborah
has
replaced
her
yet
in
her
voice
was
such
a
readiness
for
hostility
toward
her
sister
that
roger
shot
an
uneasy
glance
from
under
his
thick
grayish
brows
has
deborah
left
the
house
he
asked
to
gain
time
for
his
answer
edith
small
lip
slightly
curled
oh
yes
long
ago
she
replied
she
had
just
a
moment
to
see
the
children
and
then
she
had
to
be
off
to
school
to
her
office
i
mean
with
so
many
schools
on
her
hands
these
days
i
do
wonder
she
has
had
time
for
the
servants
no
no
you
mistaken
he
said
that
is
the
trouble
it
not
her
fault
in
fact
it
was
all
my
idea
idea
she
retorted
in
an
amused
affectionate
tone
and
roger
grimly
gathered
himself
it
would
he
extremely
difficult
breaking
his
unpleasant
news
yes
he
answered
you
see
this
damnable
war
abroad
has
hit
me
in
my
business
oh
father
how
she
asked
him
in
an
instant
she
was
all
alert
you
do
mean
seriously
she
said
yes
i
do
he
answered
and
he
began
to
tell
her
why
but
she
soon
grew
impatient
business
details
meant
nothing
to
edith
i
see
she
kept
saying
yes
yes
i
see
she
wanted
him
to
come
to
the
point
so
i
had
to
mortgage
the
house
he
concluded
and
for
very
little
money
my
dear
and
a
good
deal
of
that
he
cleared
his
throat
had
to
go
back
into
the
business
i
see
said
edith
mechanically
her
mind
was
already
far
away
roving
over
her
plans
for
the
children
for
in
roger
look
of
suspense
she
plainly
read
that
other
plans
had
been
made
for
them
in
her
absence
deborah
in
this
flashed
through
her
mind
tell
me
what
it
will
mean
she
said
i
afraid
you
have
to
try
to
do
without
your
nurse
for
a
while
let
hannah
go
oh
father
and
edith
flushed
with
quick
dismay
how
can
i
dad
five
children
five
and
two
of
them
so
little
they
ca
even
dress
themselves
alone
and
there
are
all
their
meals
their
baths
and
the
older
ones
going
uptown
to
school
i
ca
let
them
go
way
uptown
on
the
or
the
trolley
without
a
maid
but
edith
he
interrupted
his
face
contracting
with
distress
you
see
that
they
ca
go
to
school
she
turned
on
him
uptown
i
mean
to
those
expensive
private
schools
father
she
demanded
do
you
mean
you
want
my
children
to
go
to
common
public
schools
there
was
rage
and
amazement
upon
her
pretty
countenance
and
with
it
an
instant
certainty
too
yes
this
was
deborah
planning
but
roger
thought
that
edith
look
was
all
directed
at
himself
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
the
shame
and
humility
of
the
male
provider
no
longer
able
to
provide
he
reddened
and
looked
down
at
his
plate
you
do
understand
he
said
i
strapped
my
child
i
ca
help
it
i
poor
oh
oh
dad
i
sorry
he
glanced
up
at
his
daughter
and
saw
tears
welling
in
her
eyes
how
utterly
miserable
both
of
them
were
it
the
war
he
said
harshly
and
proudly
this
made
a
difference
to
his
pride
but
not
to
his
daughter
anxiety
she
was
not
interested
in
the
war
or
in
any
other
cause
of
the
abyss
she
was
facing
she
strove
to
think
clearly
what
to
do
but
no
she
must
do
her
thinking
alone
with
a
sudden
quiet
she
rose
from
the
table
went
around
to
her
father
chair
and
kissed
him
very
gently
all
right
dear
i
see
it
all
now
and
i
promise
i
try
my
best
she
said
you
a
brave
little
woman
he
replied
but
after
she
had
gone
he
reflected
why
had
he
called
her
a
brave
little
woman
why
had
it
all
been
so
intense
the
talk
upon
so
heroic
a
plane
it
would
be
hard
on
edith
of
course
but
others
were
doing
it
were
they
think
of
the
women
in
europe
these
days
after
all
she
be
very
comfortable
here
and
perhaps
by
christmas
times
would
change
he
shook
off
these
petty
troubles
and
went
to
his
office
for
the
day
as
she
busied
herself
unpacking
the
trunks
edith
strove
to
readjust
her
plans
by
noon
her
head
was
throbbing
but
she
took
little
notice
of
that
she
had
a
talk
with
hannah
the
devoted
irish
girl
who
had
been
with
her
ever
since
george
was
born
it
was
difficult
it
was
brutal
it
was
almost
as
though
in
edith
family
there
had
been
two
mothers
and
one
was
sending
the
other
away
there
there
poor
child
edith
comforted
her
i
find
you
another
nice
family
soon
where
you
can
stay
till
i
take
you
back
do
you
see
it
will
not
be
for
long
and
hannah
brightened
a
little
but
how
in
the
wide
wurrld
she
asked
will
you
ever
do
for
the
children
me
gone
oh
i
manage
said
edith
cheerfully
and
that
afternoon
she
began
at
once
to
rearrange
her
whole
intricate
schedule
with
hannah
and
school
both
omitted
to
fit
her
children
into
the
house
but
instead
of
this
as
the
days
wore
on
days
of
worry
and
toil
sternly
and
quite
unconsciously
she
fitted
the
house
to
her
children
and
nobody
made
her
aware
of
the
fact
all
summer
long
in
the
mountains
everyone
by
tacit
consent
had
made
way
for
her
had
deferred
to
her
grief
in
the
little
things
that
make
up
the
everyday
life
in
a
home
and
to
this
precedent
once
established
edith
now
clung
unawares
her
new
day
gave
her
small
time
to
think
it
began
at
five
in
the
morning
when
roger
was
awakened
by
the
gleeful
cries
of
the
two
wee
boys
who
slept
with
their
mother
in
the
next
room
the
room
which
had
been
deborah
and
edith
was
busy
from
that
time
on
first
came
the
washing
and
dressing
and
breakfast
which
was
a
merry
boisterous
meal
then
the
baby
was
taken
out
to
his
carriage
on
the
porch
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
after
that
in
her
father
study
from
which
he
had
fled
with
his
morning
cigar
for
two
hours
edith
held
school
for
her
children
trying
her
best
to
be
patient
and
clear
with
she
had
purchased
from
their
former
schools
uptown
for
two
severe
hours
shutting
the
world
all
out
of
her
head
she
tried
to
teach
them
about
it
at
eleven
their
nerves
on
edge
like
her
own
she
sent
them
outdoors
to
play
intrusting
the
small
ones
to
betsy
and
george
who
took
them
to
washington
square
nearby
with
strict
injunctions
to
keep
them
away
from
all
other
children
no
doubt
there
were
nice
children
there
but
she
herself
could
not
be
along
to
distinguish
the
nice
from
the
common
for
until
one
she
was
busy
at
home
bathing
the
baby
and
making
the
beds
and
then
hurrying
to
the
kitchen
to
pasteurize
the
milk
and
keep
a
vigilant
oversight
on
the
cooking
of
the
midday
meal
and
the
old
cook
growing
resentment
made
it
far
from
easy
after
luncheon
thank
heaven
came
their
naps
and
all
afternoon
while
again
they
went
out
edith
would
look
over
their
wardrobes
mend
and
alter
and
patch
and
contrive
how
to
make
last
winter
clothes
look
new
at
times
she
would
drop
her
work
in
her
lap
and
stare
wretchedly
before
her
this
was
what
she
had
never
known
this
was
what
made
life
around
her
grim
and
hard
relentless
frightening
this
was
what
it
was
to
be
poor
how
it
changed
the
whole
city
of
new
york
behind
it
the
sinister
cause
of
it
all
she
thought
confusedly
now
and
then
of
the
great
death
across
the
sea
of
the
armies
smoking
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
the
villages
blazing
the
women
and
children
flying
away
but
never
for
more
than
a
moment
the
war
was
so
remote
and
dim
and
soon
she
would
turn
back
again
to
her
own
beloved
children
whose
lives
so
full
of
happiness
so
rich
in
promise
hitherto
were
now
so
cramped
and
thwarted
each
day
was
harder
than
the
last
it
was
becoming
unbearable
no
they
must
go
back
to
school
but
how
to
manage
it
how
how
it
would
cost
eight
hundred
dollars
and
this
would
take
nearly
all
the
money
she
would
be
able
to
secure
by
the
sale
of
her
few
possessions
and
then
what
what
of
sickness
and
the
other
contingencies
which
still
lay
ahead
of
her
how
old
her
father
seemed
these
days
in
his
heavy
shock
of
hair
the
flecks
of
white
had
doubled
in
size
were
merging
one
into
the
other
and
his
tall
stooping
massive
frame
had
lost
its
look
of
ruggedness
suppose
suppose
her
breath
came
fast
was
his
life
insured
she
wondered
on
such
afternoons
in
the
upstairs
room
as
the
dusk
crept
in
and
deepened
she
would
bend
close
to
her
sewing
planning
planning
planning
at
last
she
would
hear
the
children
trooping
merrily
into
the
house
and
making
a
very
real
effort
which
at
times
was
in
truth
heroic
to
smile
she
would
rise
and
light
the
gas
would
welcome
them
gaily
and
join
in
their
chatter
and
bustle
about
on
the
countless
tasks
of
washing
them
getting
their
suppers
undressing
the
small
ones
and
hearing
their
prayers
with
smiling
kisses
she
would
tuck
her
two
babies
into
their
cribs
afterward
just
for
a
moment
or
two
she
would
linger
under
the
gas
jet
her
face
still
smiling
for
a
last
look
a
last
then
darkness
darkness
settling
over
her
spirit
together
with
loneliness
and
fatigue
she
would
go
into
betsy
room
and
throw
herself
dressed
on
her
bed
and
a
dull
complete
indifference
to
everything
under
the
moon
and
the
stars
would
creep
from
her
body
up
into
her
mind
at
times
she
would
try
to
fight
it
off
at
dinner
she
must
not
be
what
she
knew
she
had
been
the
night
before
a
wet
blanket
upon
all
the
talk
but
if
they
only
knew
how
hard
it
was
what
a
perfect
hell
it
was
her
breath
coming
faster
she
would
dig
her
nails
into
the
palms
of
her
hands
one
night
she
noticed
and
looked
at
her
hand
and
saw
the
skin
was
actually
cut
and
a
little
blood
was
appearing
she
had
read
of
women
doing
this
but
she
had
never
done
it
before
not
even
when
her
babies
were
born
she
had
gripped
bruce
hand
instead
chapter
xxvii
roger
found
her
like
that
one
evening
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
a
sob
from
the
room
for
she
had
forgotten
to
close
the
door
he
came
into
the
doorway
but
drew
back
and
closed
the
door
with
barely
a
sound
frowning
and
irresolute
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
then
turned
and
went
into
his
room
soon
he
heard
deborah
enter
the
house
and
come
slowly
up
the
stairs
she
too
had
had
a
hard
day
he
recalled
a
day
all
filled
with
turbulence
with
problems
and
with
vexing
toil
in
her
enormous
family
and
he
felt
he
could
not
blame
her
for
not
being
of
more
help
at
home
still
he
had
been
disappointed
of
late
in
her
manner
toward
her
sister
he
had
hoped
she
would
draw
closer
to
edith
now
that
again
they
were
living
together
in
their
old
home
where
they
had
been
born
but
no
it
had
worked
just
the
opposite
way
they
were
getting
upon
each
other
nerves
why
could
she
make
overtures
small
kindly
proffers
of
help
and
advice
and
sympathy
the
womanly
things
from
his
room
he
heard
her
knock
softly
at
the
same
door
he
had
closed
and
he
heard
her
low
clear
voice
are
you
there
edith
dear
he
listened
a
moment
intently
but
he
could
not
hear
the
reply
then
deborah
said
oh
you
poor
thing
i
awfully
sorry
edith
do
bother
to
come
downstairs
let
me
bring
you
up
your
supper
a
pause
i
wish
you
would
i
love
to
he
heard
deborah
come
by
his
door
and
go
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
to
the
room
she
had
taken
on
the
third
floor
i
was
wrong
he
reflected
she
has
been
trying
but
it
does
do
any
good
women
simply
have
it
in
to
see
each
other
point
of
view
deborah
does
admire
edith
she
ca
she
only
pities
her
and
puts
her
down
as
out
of
date
and
edith
feels
that
and
it
gets
her
riled
and
she
sets
herself
like
an
angry
old
hen
against
all
deborah
new
ideas
why
the
devil
ca
they
live
and
let
live
and
he
hesitated
savagely
between
a
pearl
gray
a
black
cravat
then
he
heard
another
step
on
the
stairs
it
was
much
slower
than
deborah
and
cautious
and
dogged
one
foot
lifted
carefully
after
the
other
it
was
john
who
had
finished
his
kitchen
supper
and
was
silently
making
his
way
up
through
the
house
to
his
room
at
the
top
there
to
keep
out
of
sight
for
the
evening
and
it
came
into
roger
mind
that
john
had
been
acting
in
just
this
fashion
ever
since
edith
had
been
in
the
house
we
have
trouble
there
too
he
told
himself
as
he
jerked
the
black
satin
cravat
into
place
a
tie
he
thoroughly
disliked
yes
black
by
george
he
felt
like
it
these
women
these
evenings
this
worry
this
war
this
world
gone
raving
driveling
mad
and
frowning
with
annoyance
roger
went
down
to
his
dinner
as
he
waited
he
grew
impatient
he
had
eaten
no
lunch
he
was
hungry
and
he
was
very
tired
too
for
he
had
had
his
own
hard
day
pshaw
he
got
up
angrily
must
be
genial
here
he
went
into
the
dining
room
and
poured
himself
a
good
stiff
drink
roger
had
never
been
much
of
a
drinker
ever
since
his
marriage
cigars
had
been
his
only
vice
but
of
late
he
had
been
having
curious
little
sinking
spells
they
worried
him
and
he
told
himself
he
could
not
afford
to
get
either
too
tired
or
too
faint
nevertheless
he
reflected
it
was
setting
a
bad
example
for
george
but
glancing
into
his
study
he
saw
that
the
lad
was
completely
absorbed
with
knees
drawn
up
his
long
lank
form
all
hunched
and
huddled
on
the
lounge
hair
rumpled
george
was
reading
a
book
which
had
a
cover
of
tough
gray
cloth
at
the
sight
of
it
his
grandfather
smiled
for
he
had
seen
it
once
before
where
george
had
obtained
it
the
lord
only
knew
its
title
was
bulls
and
breeding
a
thoroughly
practical
little
book
but
nothing
for
george
mother
to
see
as
his
grandfather
entered
behind
him
the
boy
looked
up
with
a
guilty
start
and
resumed
with
a
short
breath
of
relief
young
elizabeth
too
had
a
furtive
air
for
instead
of
preparing
her
history
lesson
she
was
deep
in
the
evening
paper
reading
about
the
war
abroad
stout
and
florid
rather
plain
but
with
a
frank
attractive
face
and
honest
clear
appealing
eyes
this
curious
creature
of
thirteen
was
sitting
firmly
in
her
chair
with
her
feet
planted
wide
apart
eagerly
scanning
an
account
of
the
work
of
american
surgeons
in
france
and
again
roger
smiled
to
himself
he
was
feeling
so
much
better
now
so
betsy
was
still
thinking
of
becoming
a
surgeon
he
wondered
what
she
would
take
up
next
in
the
past
two
years
in
swift
succession
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
a
novelist
an
actress
and
a
women
college
president
and
roger
liked
this
tremendously
he
loved
to
watch
these
two
in
the
house
here
again
his
family
was
widening
out
before
him
with
new
figures
arising
to
draw
his
attention
this
way
and
that
but
these
were
bright
distractions
he
took
a
deep
amused
delight
in
watching
these
two
youngsters
caught
between
two
fires
on
the
one
side
their
mother
and
upon
the
other
their
aunt
both
obviously
drawn
toward
deborah
a
figure
who
stood
in
their
regard
for
all
that
thrilling
outside
world
that
heaving
sparkling
ocean
on
which
they
too
would
soon
embark
both
sternly
repressing
their
eagerness
as
an
insult
to
their
mother
whom
they
loved
and
pitied
so
regarding
her
as
a
brave
and
dear
but
rapidly
ageing
creature
well
on
in
her
thirties
whom
they
must
cherish
and
preserve
they
both
had
such
solemn
thoughts
as
they
looked
at
edith
in
her
chair
but
as
roger
watched
them
with
their
love
and
their
solemnity
their
guilt
and
their
perplexity
with
quiet
enjoyment
he
would
wait
to
see
the
change
he
knew
would
come
and
it
always
did
the
sudden
picking
up
of
a
book
the
vanishing
of
an
anxious
frown
and
in
an
instant
their
young
minds
had
turned
happily
back
into
themselves
into
their
own
engrossing
lives
their
plans
their
intimate
dreams
and
ambitions
all
so
curiously
bound
up
with
memories
of
small
happenings
which
had
struck
them
as
funny
that
day
and
at
which
they
would
suddenly
chuckle
aloud
and
this
was
only
one
stage
in
their
growth
what
would
be
the
next
he
asked
and
all
the
others
after
that
what
kind
of
world
would
they
live
in
please
heaven
there
would
be
no
wars
many
old
things
no
doubt
would
be
changed
by
the
work
of
deborah
and
her
kind
but
not
too
many
roger
hoped
and
these
young
people
meanwhile
would
be
bringing
up
children
in
their
turn
so
the
family
would
go
on
and
multiply
and
scatter
wide
never
to
unite
again
and
he
thought
he
could
catch
glimpses
very
small
and
far
away
but
bright
as
patches
of
sunlight
upon
distant
mountain
tops
into
the
widening
vista
of
those
many
lives
ahead
a
wistful
look
crept
over
his
face
in
their
lives
too
we
shall
be
there
the
dim
strong
figures
of
the
past
deborah
came
into
the
room
and
at
once
the
whole
atmosphere
changed
her
niece
sprang
up
delightedly
why
auntie
how
lovely
you
look
she
exclaimed
and
roger
eyed
deborah
in
surprise
though
she
did
not
believe
in
mourning
she
had
been
wearing
dark
gowns
of
late
to
avoid
hurting
edith
feelings
but
she
had
donned
bright
colors
instead
her
dress
was
as
near
décolleté
as
anything
that
deborah
wore
and
there
was
a
band
of
dull
blue
velvet
bound
about
her
hair
thanks
dearie
she
said
smiling
shall
we
go
in
to
dinner
now
she
added
to
her
father
edith
said
not
to
wait
for
her
and
i
have
to
be
off
rather
early
this
evening
what
is
it
he
inquired
a
big
meeting
at
cooper
union
and
at
dinner
she
went
on
to
say
that
in
her
five
schools
the
neighborhood
clubs
had
combined
to
hold
this
meeting
and
she
herself
was
to
preside
at
once
her
young
niece
was
all
animation
oh
i
wish
i
could
go
and
hear
you
she
sighed
afraid
you
ca
betsy
her
aunt
replied
and
at
this
with
an
instinctive
glance
toward
the
door
where
her
mother
would
soon
come
in
to
stop
by
her
mere
presence
all
such
conversation
elizabeth
eagerly
threw
out
one
inquiry
after
the
other
pell
mell
how
on
earth
do
you
do
it
she
wanted
to
know
how
do
you
get
a
speech
ready
aunt
deborah
how
much
of
it
do
you
write
out
ahead
are
you
just
the
least
bit
nervous
now
i
mean
this
minute
and
how
will
you
feel
on
the
platform
on
earth
do
you
do
with
your
feet
as
the
girl
bent
forward
there
with
her
gaze
fixed
ardently
on
her
aunt
her
grandfather
thought
in
half
comic
dismay
lord
now
she
want
to
be
a
great
speaker
like
her
aunt
and
she
will
tell
her
mother
so
what
the
meeting
all
about
he
inquired
and
deborah
began
to
explain
in
her
five
schools
the
poverty
was
rapidly
becoming
worse
each
week
more
children
stayed
away
or
came
to
school
ragged
and
unkempt
some
without
any
overcoats
small
pitiful
mites
wearing
shoes
so
old
as
barely
to
stick
on
their
feet
and
when
the
teachers
and
visitors
followed
these
children
into
their
homes
they
found
bare
dirty
chilly
rooms
where
the
little
folk
shivered
and
wailed
for
food
and
the
mothers
looked
distracted
gaunt
and
sullen
and
half
crazed
over
three
hundred
thousand
workers
were
idle
in
the
city
meanwhile
to
make
matters
worse
half
the
money
from
uptown
which
had
gone
in
former
years
into
work
for
the
tenements
was
going
over
to
belgium
instead
and
the
same
relentless
drain
of
war
was
felt
by
the
tenement
people
themselves
for
all
of
them
were
foreigners
and
from
their
relatives
abroad
in
those
wide
zones
of
europe
already
blackened
and
laid
waste
in
endless
torrents
through
the
mails
came
wild
appeals
for
money
in
such
homes
her
children
lived
and
deborah
had
set
her
mind
on
vigorous
measures
of
relief
landlords
must
be
made
to
wait
and
the
city
be
persuaded
to
give
work
to
the
most
needy
food
and
fuel
must
be
secured
as
she
spoke
of
the
task
before
her
with
a
flush
of
animation
upon
her
bright
expressive
face
at
the
thought
that
in
less
than
an
hour
she
would
be
facing
thousands
of
people
the
gloom
of
the
picture
she
painted
was
dispelled
in
the
spirit
she
showed
these
things
always
work
out
she
declared
with
an
impatient
shrug
of
her
shoulders
and
watching
her
admiringly
young
betsy
thought
how
strong
she
is
what
a
wonderful
woman
and
roger
watching
thought
how
young
what
things
it
was
edith
voice
at
the
door
and
among
those
at
the
table
there
was
a
little
stir
of
alarm
she
had
entered
unnoticed
and
now
took
her
seat
she
was
looking
pale
and
tired
what
things
work
out
so
finely
she
asked
and
with
a
glance
at
deborah
gown
where
are
you
going
she
added
to
a
meeting
deborah
answered
oh
and
edith
began
her
soup
in
the
awkward
pause
that
followed
twice
deborah
started
to
speak
to
her
sister
but
checked
herself
for
at
other
dinners
just
like
this
she
had
made
such
dismal
failures
by
the
way
edith
she
said
at
last
i
been
thinking
of
all
that
furniture
of
yours
which
is
lying
in
storage
her
sister
looked
up
at
her
startled
what
about
it
she
asked
there
so
much
of
it
you
do
care
for
deborah
answered
quietly
why
do
you
let
a
part
of
it
go
i
mean
the
few
pieces
you
always
disliked
for
what
purpose
why
it
seems
such
a
pity
not
to
have
hannah
back
in
the
house
she
would
make
things
so
much
easier
roger
felt
a
glow
of
relief
a
capital
plan
he
declared
at
once
it
would
be
edith
corrected
him
if
i
had
already
made
plans
and
then
in
a
brisk
breathless
tone
you
see
i
made
up
my
mind
she
said
to
sell
not
only
part
but
my
furniture
very
soon
and
a
few
other
belongings
as
well
and
use
the
money
to
put
george
and
elizabeth
and
little
bob
back
in
the
schools
where
they
belong
mother
gasped
elizabeth
and
with
a
prolonged
of
delight
she
ran
around
to
her
mother
chair
but
look
here
george
blurted
worriedly
i
do
like
it
mother
darned
if
i
do
you
selling
everything
just
for
school
school
is
rather
important
george
was
edith
tart
rejoinder
if
you
do
think
so
ask
your
aunt
what
do
you
think
of
it
auntie
he
asked
the
cloud
which
had
come
on
deborah
face
was
lifted
in
an
instant
i
think
george
she
answered
gently
that
you
better
let
your
mother
do
what
she
thinks
best
for
you
it
make
things
easier
here
in
the
house
she
added
to
her
sister
but
i
wish
you
could
have
hannah
too
oh
i
manage
nicely
now
said
edith
and
with
a
slight
smile
of
triumph
she
resumed
her
dinner
the
war
wo
last
forever
muttered
roger
uneasily
and
to
himself
but
suppose
it
last
a
year
or
more
he
did
not
approve
of
scheme
it
burning
her
bridges
all
at
once
for
something
that
essential
he
thought
but
he
would
not
tell
her
so
meanwhile
deborah
glanced
at
the
clock
oh
it
nearly
eight
i
must
hurry
or
i
be
late
she
said
all
and
she
left
them
roger
followed
her
into
the
hall
what
do
you
think
of
this
he
demanded
her
reply
was
a
tolerant
shrug
it
her
own
money
father
all
her
money
he
rejoined
every
dollar
she
has
in
the
world
but
i
do
just
see
how
it
can
be
helped
ca
you
talk
to
her
show
her
what
folly
it
is
hardly
said
deborah
smiling
already
she
had
on
her
coat
and
hat
and
was
turning
to
go
and
her
father
scowled
with
annoyance
she
was
always
going
he
told
himself
leaving
him
to
handle
her
sister
alone
he
would
like
to
go
out
himself
in
the
evenings
yes
by
george
this
very
night
it
would
act
like
a
tonic
on
his
mind
just
for
a
moment
standing
there
he
saw
cooper
union
packed
to
the
doors
he
heard
the
ringing
speeches
the
cheers
but
no
it
was
not
to
be
thought
of
with
this
silent
war
going
on
in
his
house
he
knew
he
must
stay
neutral
watchful
waiting
was
his
course
if
he
went
out
with
deborah
edith
would
be
distinctly
hurt
and
sitting
all
evening
here
alone
she
would
draw
still
deeper
into
herself
and
so
it
would
be
night
after
night
as
it
had
been
for
many
weeks
he
would
be
cooped
up
at
home
while
deborah
did
the
running
about
in
half
the
time
it
takes
to
tell
it
roger
had
worked
himself
into
a
state
where
he
felt
like
a
mighty
badly
used
man
i
wish
you
speak
to
her
he
said
i
wish
you
could
manage
to
find
time
to
be
here
more
in
the
evenings
edith
worries
so
much
and
trying
so
hard
a
little
sympathy
now
and
then
but
she
does
seem
to
want
any
from
me
said
his
daughter
a
bit
impatiently
i
know
it
hard
of
course
it
is
but
what
can
i
do
she
wo
let
me
help
and
besides
there
are
other
families
you
know
thousands
really
suffering
for
the
lack
of
all
that
we
have
here
she
smiled
and
kissed
him
quickly
dad
dear
i
got
to
run
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
chapter
xxviii
after
dinner
that
night
in
the
living
room
the
two
older
children
studied
their
lessons
and
edith
sat
mending
a
pair
of
rompers
for
little
tad
presently
roger
came
out
from
his
den
with
the
evening
paper
in
his
hand
and
sat
down
close
beside
her
he
did
this
conscientiously
almost
every
evening
with
a
sigh
he
opened
his
paper
to
read
again
there
was
silence
in
the
room
and
in
this
silence
roger
mind
roamed
far
away
across
the
sea
for
the
front
page
of
his
paper
was
filled
with
the
usual
headlines
tidings
which
a
year
before
would
have
made
a
man
heart
jump
into
his
throat
but
which
were
getting
commonplace
now
dead
and
wounded
by
the
thousands
famine
bombs
and
shrapnel
hideous
atrocities
submarines
and
floating
mines
words
once
remote
but
now
familiar
always
there
on
the
front
page
and
penetrating
into
his
soul
becoming
a
part
of
roger
gale
so
that
never
again
when
the
war
was
done
would
he
be
the
same
man
he
was
before
for
he
had
forever
lost
his
faith
in
the
sanity
and
steadiness
of
the
great
mind
of
humanity
roger
had
thought
of
mankind
as
mature
but
there
had
come
to
him
of
late
the
same
feeling
he
had
had
before
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
mankind
had
suddenly
unmasked
and
shown
itself
for
what
it
was
still
only
a
precocious
child
with
a
terrible
precocity
for
its
growth
had
been
one
sided
its
strength
was
growing
at
a
speed
breathless
and
astounding
but
its
vision
and
its
poise
its
sense
of
human
justice
of
kindliness
and
tolerance
and
of
generous
brotherly
love
these
had
been
neglected
and
were
being
left
behind
vaguely
he
thought
of
its
ships
of
steel
its
railroads
and
its
flaming
mills
its
miracles
its
prodigies
and
the
picture
rose
in
his
mind
of
a
child
standing
there
of
giant
size
with
dangerous
playthings
in
its
hands
and
boastfully
declaring
i
can
thunder
over
the
earth
dive
in
the
ocean
soar
on
the
clouds
i
can
shiver
to
atoms
a
mountain
i
can
drench
whole
lands
with
blood
i
can
look
up
and
laugh
at
god
and
roger
frowned
as
he
read
the
news
what
strange
new
century
lay
ahead
what
convulsing
throes
of
change
what
was
in
store
for
his
children
tighter
set
his
heavy
jaw
it
shall
be
good
he
told
himself
with
a
grim
determination
for
them
there
shall
be
better
things
something
great
and
splendid
shall
come
out
of
it
at
last
they
will
look
back
upon
this
time
as
i
look
on
the
french
revolution
he
tried
to
peer
into
that
world
ahead
dazzling
distant
as
the
sun
but
then
with
a
sigh
he
returned
to
the
news
and
little
by
little
his
mind
again
was
gripped
and
held
by
the
most
compelling
of
all
appeals
so
far
revealed
in
humanity
growth
the
appeal
of
war
to
the
mind
of
a
man
he
frowned
as
he
read
but
he
read
on
why
did
england
send
over
more
men
the
clock
struck
nine
now
george
now
elizabeth
edith
said
with
the
usual
delay
and
reluctance
the
children
brought
their
work
to
an
end
kissed
their
mother
and
went
up
to
bed
and
edith
continued
sewing
presently
she
smiled
to
herself
little
tad
had
been
so
droll
that
day
on
the
third
page
of
his
paper
roger
glance
was
arrested
by
a
full
column
story
concerning
deborah
meeting
that
night
and
as
in
a
long
interview
he
read
here
in
the
public
print
the
same
things
she
had
told
him
at
supper
he
felt
a
little
glow
of
pride
yes
this
daughter
of
his
was
a
wonderful
woman
living
a
big
useful
life
taking
a
leading
part
in
work
which
would
certainly
brighten
the
lives
of
millions
of
children
still
unborn
again
he
felt
the
tonic
of
it
here
was
a
glimmer
of
hope
in
the
world
here
was
an
antidote
to
war
he
finished
the
column
and
glanced
up
edith
was
still
sewing
he
thought
of
her
plan
to
sell
all
she
possessed
in
order
to
put
her
children
back
in
their
expensive
schools
uptown
why
ca
she
save
her
money
he
thought
god
knows
there
little
enough
of
it
left
but
i
ca
tell
her
that
if
i
do
she
sell
everything
hand
me
the
cash
and
tell
me
she
sorry
to
be
such
a
burden
she
sit
like
a
thundercloud
in
my
house
no
he
could
say
nothing
to
stop
her
and
over
the
top
of
his
paper
her
father
shot
a
look
at
her
of
keen
exasperation
why
risk
everything
she
had
to
get
these
needless
frills
and
fads
why
must
she
cram
her
life
so
full
of
petty
plans
and
worries
and
little
jobs
for
the
sake
leave
their
clothes
alone
and
why
these
careful
little
rules
for
every
minute
of
their
day
for
their
washing
their
dressing
their
eating
their
napping
their
play
and
the
very
air
they
breathed
he
crumpled
his
paper
impatiently
she
was
always
talking
of
being
well
then
why
not
be
that
way
let
her
live
as
her
grandmother
had
up
there
in
the
mountain
farmhouse
had
not
been
so
particular
with
one
hired
girl
she
had
thought
herself
lucky
and
not
only
had
she
cooked
and
sewed
but
she
had
spun
and
woven
too
had
churned
and
made
cheese
and
pickles
and
jam
and
quilts
and
even
mattresses
once
in
two
months
she
had
cut
hair
and
the
rest
of
the
time
she
had
let
him
alone
except
for
something
really
worth
while
a
broken
arm
for
example
or
church
she
had
stuck
to
the
essentials
but
edith
was
not
nor
was
she
alive
to
this
modern
age
in
short
she
was
neither
here
nor
there
then
from
the
nursery
above
her
smallest
boy
was
heard
to
cry
with
a
little
sigh
of
weariness
quickly
she
rose
and
went
upstairs
and
a
few
moments
later
to
roger
ears
came
a
low
sweet
soothing
lullaby
years
ago
edith
had
asked
him
to
teach
her
some
of
his
mother
cradle
songs
and
the
one
which
she
was
singing
was
a
song
he
had
heard
when
he
was
small
when
the
mountain
storms
had
shrieked
and
beat
upon
the
rattling
old
house
and
he
had
been
frightened
and
had
cried
out
and
his
mother
had
come
to
his
bed
in
the
dark
he
felt
as
though
she
were
near
him
now
and
as
he
listened
to
the
song
from
the
deep
well
of
sentiment
which
was
a
part
of
roger
gale
rose
memories
that
changed
his
mood
and
with
it
his
sense
of
proportions
here
was
motherhood
of
the
genuine
kind
not
orating
in
cooper
union
in
the
name
of
every
child
in
new
york
but
crooning
low
and
tenderly
soothing
one
little
child
to
sleep
one
of
the
five
she
herself
had
borne
in
agony
without
complaint
how
edith
had
slaved
and
sacrificed
how
bravely
she
had
rallied
after
the
death
of
her
husband
he
remembered
her
a
few
hours
ago
on
the
bed
upstairs
spent
and
in
anguish
sobbing
alone
and
remorse
came
over
him
deborah
talk
at
dinner
had
twisted
his
thinking
he
told
himself
well
that
was
deborah
way
of
life
she
had
her
enormous
family
and
edith
had
her
small
one
and
in
this
hell
of
misery
which
war
was
spreading
over
the
earth
each
mother
was
up
in
arms
for
her
brood
and
by
george
of
the
two
he
did
know
but
that
he
preferred
his
own
flesh
and
blood
all
very
noble
miss
deborah
and
very
dramatic
to
open
your
arms
to
all
the
children
under
the
moon
and
get
your
name
in
the
papers
but
there
was
something
pretty
fine
in
just
sitting
at
home
and
singing
to
one
all
right
little
mother
you
go
straight
ahead
this
is
war
and
panic
and
hard
times
you
perfectly
right
to
look
after
your
own
he
would
show
edith
he
did
not
begrudge
her
this
use
of
her
small
property
and
more
than
that
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
take
her
out
of
her
loneliness
how
about
reading
aloud
to
her
he
had
been
a
capital
reader
during
judith
lifetime
for
he
had
always
enjoyed
it
so
roger
rose
and
went
to
his
shelves
and
began
to
look
over
the
volumes
there
perhaps
a
book
of
travel
stoddard
lectures
on
japan
meanwhile
edith
came
into
the
room
sat
down
and
took
up
her
sewing
as
she
did
so
he
turned
and
glanced
at
her
and
she
smiled
brightly
back
at
him
yes
he
thought
with
a
genial
glow
from
this
night
on
he
would
do
his
part
he
came
back
to
his
chair
with
a
book
in
his
hand
prepared
to
start
on
his
new
course
father
she
said
quietly
her
eyes
were
on
the
work
in
her
lap
yes
my
child
what
is
it
it
about
john
she
answered
and
with
a
movement
of
alarm
he
looked
at
his
daughter
intently
what
the
matter
with
john
he
inquired
he
has
tuberculosis
she
said
he
has
no
such
thing
her
father
retorted
john
has
pott
disease
of
the
spine
yes
i
know
he
has
she
replied
and
i
sorry
for
him
poor
lad
but
in
the
last
year
she
added
certain
complications
have
come
and
now
tubercular
as
well
how
do
you
know
he
does
cough
his
lungs
are
sound
as
yours
or
mine
no
it
edith
pursed
her
lips
it
different
she
said
softly
who
told
you
he
demanded
not
deborah
was
the
quick
response
she
knew
it
i
certain
for
i
find
that
she
been
having
neale
the
woman
who
comes
in
to
wash
do
john
things
in
a
separate
tub
i
found
her
doing
it
yesterday
and
she
told
me
what
deborah
had
said
it
the
first
i
heard
of
it
roger
put
in
i
know
it
is
she
answered
for
if
you
heard
of
it
before
i
believe
you
have
been
as
ready
as
deborah
was
apparently
to
risk
infecting
the
children
here
edith
voice
was
gentle
slow
and
relentless
there
was
still
a
reflection
in
her
eyes
of
the
tenderness
which
had
been
there
as
she
had
soothed
her
child
to
sleep
as
time
goes
on
john
is
bound
to
get
worse
the
risk
will
be
greater
every
week
oh
pshaw
cried
her
father
no
such
thing
you
just
scaring
yourself
over
nothing
at
all
doctor
lake
did
think
i
was
lake
was
the
big
child
specialist
in
whose
care
edith
children
had
been
for
years
i
talked
to
him
on
the
telephone
and
he
said
we
should
get
john
out
of
the
house
roger
heartily
damned
doctor
lake
it
easy
to
find
a
good
home
for
the
boy
edith
went
on
quietly
close
by
if
you
like
in
some
respectable
family
that
will
be
only
too
thankful
to
take
in
a
boarder
how
about
the
danger
to
that
family
children
roger
asked
malignantly
very
well
father
do
as
you
please
take
any
risk
you
want
to
i
taking
no
risk
he
retorted
if
there
were
any
risk
they
would
have
told
me
allan
and
deborah
would
i
mean
they
would
burst
from
edith
with
a
vehemence
which
startled
him
they
take
the
same
risk
for
my
children
they
would
for
any
street
urchin
in
town
all
children
are
the
same
in
their
eyes
and
if
you
feel
as
they
do
i
do
feel
as
they
do
do
you
then
i
telling
you
that
doctor
lake
said
there
was
very
serious
risk
every
day
this
boy
remains
in
the
house
roger
rose
angrily
from
his
chair
so
you
want
me
to
turn
him
out
no
i
want
you
to
wait
a
few
days
until
we
can
find
him
a
decent
home
all
right
i
wo
do
it
very
well
father
it
your
house
not
mine
for
a
few
moments
longer
she
sat
at
her
sewing
while
her
father
walked
the
floor
then
abruptly
she
rose
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
and
left
the
room
and
he
heard
a
sob
as
she
went
upstairs
now
she
shut
herself
up
with
her
children
he
reflected
savagely
and
hold
the
fort
till
i
come
to
terms
rather
than
risk
a
hair
on
their
heads
edith
would
turn
the
whole
world
out
of
doors
he
thought
of
deborah
and
he
groaned
she
would
have
to
be
told
of
this
and
when
she
was
what
a
row
there
would
be
for
johnny
was
one
of
family
he
glanced
at
the
clock
she
be
coming
home
soon
should
he
tell
her
not
just
for
one
evening
he
had
enough
he
picked
up
the
book
he
had
meant
to
read
stoddard
lectures
on
japan
and
roger
snorted
wrathfully
by
george
how
like
to
go
to
japan
or
to
darkest
africa
anywhere
chapter
xxix
but
later
in
the
evening
when
allan
and
deborah
came
in
roger
who
in
the
meantime
had
had
a
good
hour
in
japan
and
was
somewhat
relaxed
and
soothed
decided
at
once
this
was
the
time
to
tell
her
and
have
done
with
it
for
deborah
was
flushed
with
triumph
the
meeting
had
been
a
huge
success
cooper
union
had
been
packed
to
the
walls
with
an
overflow
meeting
out
on
the
street
thousands
of
dollars
had
been
pledged
and
some
big
politicians
had
promised
support
and
men
and
women
rich
and
poor
had
volunteered
their
services
she
started
to
tell
him
about
it
but
noticed
his
troubled
expression
and
asked
him
what
was
on
his
mind
oh
nothing
tremendous
roger
said
i
hate
to
be
any
damper
i
had
meant
to
tell
you
but
i
think
i
will
now
for
you
look
as
though
you
could
find
a
solution
for
anything
then
i
must
look
like
an
idiot
his
daughter
said
what
is
it
she
demanded
it
about
john
her
countenance
changed
oh
is
he
worse
edith
thinks
he
is
and
she
says
it
not
safe
i
see
she
wants
him
out
of
the
house
tell
me
what
she
said
to
you
as
he
did
so
she
listened
intently
and
turning
to
allan
at
the
end
what
do
you
say
to
this
allan
she
asked
is
there
any
real
risk
to
the
children
a
little
he
responded
as
much
as
they
take
every
day
in
the
trolley
going
to
school
they
never
go
in
the
trolley
deborah
answered
dryly
they
always
go
on
the
top
of
the
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
well
there
no
use
discussing
it
if
edith
feels
that
way
john
must
go
the
house
wo
be
livable
till
he
does
roger
looked
at
her
in
surprise
he
felt
both
relieved
and
disappointed
john
only
one
of
thousands
to
her
he
told
himself
aggrievedly
he
is
close
to
her
she
has
room
she
has
a
whole
mass
meeting
in
her
head
but
i
have
by
george
i
like
the
boy
and
i
the
one
who
will
have
to
tell
him
to
pack
up
and
leave
the
house
is
it
the
very
devil
how
things
all
come
back
on
me
look
here
father
deborah
said
suppose
you
let
me
manage
this
and
roger
heavy
visage
cleared
you
mean
you
tell
him
yes
she
replied
and
he
understand
it
perfectly
i
think
he
has
been
expecting
it
i
have
for
a
good
many
weeks
she
added
with
some
bitterness
and
i
know
some
people
who
will
be
glad
enough
to
take
him
in
i
see
that
he
made
comfortable
only
her
face
clouded
it
has
meant
a
lot
to
him
being
here
her
father
put
in
gruffly
oh
john
used
to
getting
knocks
in
this
world
her
quiet
voice
grew
hard
and
stern
i
was
thinking
of
john
just
now
what
frightens
me
at
times
like
this
is
edith
she
said
slowly
no
not
just
edith
motherhood
i
see
it
in
so
many
mothers
these
days
in
the
women
downtown
in
their
fight
for
their
children
against
all
other
children
on
earth
it
the
hardest
thing
we
have
to
do
to
try
to
make
them
see
and
feel
outside
of
their
own
small
tenement
homes
and
help
each
other
pull
together
they
ca
see
it
their
only
chance
and
all
because
of
this
mother
love
it
so
blind
sometimes
like
an
animal
she
broke
off
and
for
a
moment
she
seemed
to
be
looking
deep
into
herself
and
i
suppose
we
all
like
that
we
women
are
she
muttered
when
we
marry
and
have
children
if
the
pinch
is
ever
hard
enough
would
be
said
allan
and
a
sudden
sharp
uneasiness
came
into
roger
mind
when
are
you
two
to
be
married
he
asked
without
stopping
to
think
and
at
once
he
regretted
his
question
with
a
quick
impatient
look
at
him
allan
bent
over
a
book
on
the
table
i
do
know
deborah
answered
next
spring
i
hope
the
frown
was
still
on
her
face
do
make
it
too
long
said
her
father
brusquely
he
left
them
and
went
up
to
bed
deborah
sat
motionless
she
wished
allan
would
go
for
she
guessed
what
was
coming
and
did
not
feel
equal
to
it
all
at
once
she
felt
tired
and
unnerved
from
her
long
exciting
evening
if
only
she
could
let
go
of
herself
and
have
a
good
cry
she
locked
her
hands
together
and
looked
up
at
him
with
impatience
he
was
still
at
the
table
his
back
was
turned
do
you
i
love
you
she
was
thinking
fiercely
ca
you
see
it
have
you
seen
it
growing
growing
day
after
day
but
i
do
want
you
here
why
ca
you
see
you
must
leave
me
alone
now
this
minute
he
turned
and
came
over
in
front
of
her
and
stood
looking
steadily
down
i
wonder
he
said
slowly
how
well
you
understand
yourself
i
think
i
do
she
muttered
with
a
sudden
twitching
of
her
lip
she
looked
quickly
up
at
him
go
on
allan
let
talk
it
all
over
now
if
you
must
not
if
you
feel
like
that
he
said
at
his
tone
of
displeasure
she
caught
his
hand
yes
yes
i
want
to
please
she
cried
it
better
really
believe
me
it
is
he
hesitated
a
moment
his
wide
generous
mouth
set
hard
and
then
in
a
tone
as
sharp
as
hers
he
demanded
are
you
sure
you
marry
me
next
spring
are
you
sure
you
you
will
next
spring
are
you
sure
this
sister
of
yours
in
the
house
on
your
nerves
day
and
night
with
this
blind
narrow
motherhood
this
motherhood
which
frightens
you
is
frightening
you
too
much
no
a
little
but
not
too
much
her
deep
sweet
voice
was
trembling
you
the
one
who
frightens
me
if
you
only
knew
when
you
come
like
this
with
all
you
done
for
me
back
of
you
deborah
do
be
a
fool
oh
i
know
you
say
you
done
nothing
except
what
you
been
glad
to
do
you
love
me
like
that
but
it
just
that
love
giving
up
all
your
practice
little
by
little
and
your
reputation
uptown
all
for
the
sake
of
me
allan
me
you
wrong
he
replied
compared
to
what
i
getting
i
given
up
nothing
ca
you
see
you
just
as
narrow
in
your
school
as
edith
is
right
here
in
her
home
you
look
upon
my
hospital
as
a
mere
annex
to
your
schools
when
the
truth
of
it
is
that
the
work
down
there
is
a
chance
wanted
all
my
life
ca
you
understand
he
cried
that
instead
of
your
being
in
debt
to
me
it
i
who
am
in
debt
to
you
you
a
suffragist
eh
a
feminist
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
all
right
so
you
want
to
be
equal
with
man
then
for
god
sake
why
not
begin
equal
i
no
annex
to
you
nor
you
to
me
it
has
happened
thank
god
that
our
work
fits
in
each
with
the
other
he
stopped
and
stared
seemed
to
shake
himself
he
walked
the
floor
and
when
he
turned
back
his
expression
had
changed
look
here
deborah
he
asked
with
an
appealing
humorous
smile
will
you
tell
me
what
i
driving
at
deborah
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
and
her
laughter
thrilled
with
relief
how
sure
i
feel
now
that
i
love
him
she
thought
you
proved
i
owe
you
nothing
she
cried
and
that
men
and
women
of
our
kind
can
work
on
splendidly
side
by
side
and
never
bother
our
poor
little
heads
about
anything
else
even
marriage
we
will
though
he
retorted
the
next
moment
she
was
in
his
arms
now
deborah
listen
to
reason
child
why
ca
you
marry
me
right
away
because
she
said
when
i
marry
you
i
going
to
have
you
all
to
myself
for
weeks
and
weeks
as
we
planned
before
and
afterwards
with
a
wonderful
start
and
with
the
war
over
work
less
hard
and
the
world
less
dark
and
gloomy
we
going
to
find
that
at
last
we
can
live
but
this
winter
it
could
be
like
that
this
winter
we
got
to
go
on
with
our
work
and
without
any
more
silly
worries
or
talk
about
whether
or
not
in
love
we
her
upturned
face
was
close
to
his
and
for
some
moments
nothing
was
said
well
she
asked
are
you
satisfied
no
i
want
to
get
married
but
it
is
now
a
quarter
past
one
and
i
your
physician
go
straight
to
bed
she
stopped
him
a
minute
at
the
front
door
are
you
sure
absolutely
you
understand
he
told
her
he
did
but
as
he
walked
home
he
reflected
how
tense
she
had
been
in
the
way
she
had
talked
yes
the
long
strain
was
telling
why
was
she
so
anxious
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
he
asked
when
we
were
alone
for
the
first
time
in
days
and
why
if
she
really
sure
of
her
love
does
she
hate
the
idea
that
she
in
my
debt
he
walked
faster
for
the
night
was
cold
and
there
was
a
chill
too
in
this
long
waiting
game
roger
heard
deborah
come
up
to
bed
and
he
wondered
what
they
had
been
talking
about
of
the
topic
he
himself
had
broached
each
other
love
and
marriage
possibly
for
a
minute
or
two
but
no
more
he
grumbled
for
forget
there
work
to
discuss
there
that
mass
meeting
still
on
her
mind
and
god
knows
a
woman
mind
is
never
any
child
play
but
when
you
load
a
mass
meeting
on
top
here
he
yawned
long
and
noisily
his
head
ached
he
felt
sore
and
weak
from
the
evening
entertainment
my
other
daughter
gave
me
no
he
was
through
he
had
had
enough
they
could
settle
things
to
suit
themselves
let
edith
squander
her
money
on
frills
the
more
expensive
the
better
let
her
turn
poor
johnny
out
of
the
house
let
her
give
full
play
to
her
motherhood
and
if
that
scared
deborah
out
of
marrying
let
her
stay
single
and
die
an
old
maid
he
had
worried
enough
for
his
family
he
wanted
a
little
peace
in
his
house
drowsily
he
closed
his
eyes
and
a
picture
came
into
his
mind
of
the
city
as
he
had
seen
it
only
a
few
nights
before
it
had
been
so
cool
so
calm
and
still
at
dusk
he
had
been
in
the
building
of
the
great
tower
on
madison
square
and
when
he
had
finished
his
business
there
on
an
impulse
he
had
gone
up
to
the
top
and
through
a
wide
low
window
had
stood
a
few
moments
looking
down
a
soft
light
snow
was
falling
and
from
high
up
in
the
storm
through
the
silent
whirling
flakes
he
had
looked
far
down
upon
lights
below
in
groups
and
clusters
dancing
lines
between
tall
phantom
buildings
blurred
and
ghostly
faint
unreal
from
all
that
bustle
and
fever
of
life
there
had
risen
to
him
barely
a
sound
and
the
town
had
seemed
small
and
lonely
a
little
glow
in
the
infinite
dark
fulfilling
its
allotted
place
for
its
moment
in
eternity
suddenly
from
close
over
his
head
like
a
brazen
voice
out
of
the
sky
hard
and
deafening
and
clear
the
great
bell
had
boomed
the
hour
then
again
had
come
the
silence
and
the
cool
soft
whirling
snow
like
a
dream
it
faded
all
away
and
with
a
curious
smile
on
his
face
presently
roger
fell
asleep
chapter
xxx
and
now
he
felt
the
approach
at
last
of
another
season
of
quiet
one
of
those
uneventful
times
which
come
in
family
histories
as
he
washed
and
dressed
for
dinner
one
night
a
little
later
he
thought
with
satisfaction
how
nicely
things
are
smoothing
out
his
dressing
for
dinner
as
a
rule
consisted
in
changing
his
low
wing
collar
and
his
large
round
detachable
cuffs
but
he
changed
his
cravat
as
well
from
a
black
to
a
pearl
gray
one
he
hoped
the
whole
winter
would
be
pearl
gray
the
little
storm
which
edith
had
raised
over
john
presence
in
the
house
had
been
allayed
deborah
had
talked
to
john
and
had
moved
him
with
his
belongings
to
a
comfortable
sunny
room
in
the
small
but
neat
apartment
of
a
scotch
family
nearby
and
john
had
been
so
sensible
oh
i
fine
thank
you
he
had
answered
simply
when
in
the
office
roger
had
asked
him
about
his
new
home
so
that
incident
was
closed
already
edith
was
disinfecting
john
old
room
to
her
heart
content
for
george
was
to
occupy
it
now
she
was
having
the
woodwork
repainted
and
a
new
paper
put
on
the
walls
she
had
already
purchased
a
small
new
rug
and
a
bed
and
a
bureau
and
one
easy
chair
and
was
making
a
pair
of
fresh
pretty
curtains
all
right
let
her
do
it
if
only
there
could
be
peace
in
the
house
with
his
cravat
adjusted
and
his
silver
hair
trim
from
having
just
been
cut
by
louis
over
at
the
brevoort
roger
went
comfortably
down
to
his
dinner
edith
greeted
him
with
a
smile
deborah
dining
out
she
said
very
well
he
replied
so
much
the
better
we
go
right
in
hungry
and
we
have
the
evening
to
ourselves
no
big
ideas
nor
problems
eh
daughter
he
slipped
his
hand
in
hers
and
she
gave
it
a
little
affectionate
squeeze
with
john
safely
out
of
the
way
and
not
only
the
health
of
her
children
but
their
proper
schooling
assured
edith
was
herself
again
placid
sweet
and
kindly
and
dinner
that
night
was
a
cheerful
meal
later
in
the
living
room
as
roger
contentedly
lit
his
cigar
edith
gave
an
appreciative
sniff
you
do
smoke
such
good
cigars
father
she
said
smiling
over
her
needle
and
glancing
up
at
her
daughter
betsy
dear
she
added
go
and
get
your
grandfather
evening
paper
in
quiet
perusal
of
the
news
he
spent
the
first
part
of
his
evening
the
war
did
not
bother
him
for
there
had
come
a
lull
in
the
fighting
as
though
even
war
could
know
its
place
and
times
were
better
over
here
as
skipping
all
news
from
abroad
his
eye
roved
over
the
pages
for
what
his
business
depended
upon
roger
began
to
find
it
now
the
old
familiar
headliness
were
reappearing
side
by
side
high
finance
exposures
graft
the
antics
and
didos
cut
up
by
the
sons
and
daughters
of
big
millionaires
and
after
them
in
cheery
succession
the
game
a
new
man
for
the
giants
a
new
college
building
for
cornell
a
new
city
plan
for
seattle
a
woman
senator
in
arizona
and
in
chicago
a
sporting
mayor
in
brief
all
over
the
men
and
women
old
and
new
had
risen
up
to
power
fame
notoriety
whatever
you
chose
to
call
it
men
and
women
hardly
children
was
the
better
word
but
the
thought
did
not
trouble
roger
he
had
instead
a
heartening
sense
of
the
youth
the
wild
exuberance
the
boundless
vigor
in
his
native
land
he
could
feel
it
rising
once
again
life
was
soon
to
go
on
as
before
people
were
growing
hungry
to
see
the
names
of
their
countrymen
back
in
the
headlines
where
they
belonged
and
roger
business
was
picking
up
he
was
not
sure
of
the
figure
of
his
deficit
last
week
he
had
always
been
vague
on
the
side
but
he
knew
it
was
down
considerably
when
betsy
and
george
had
gone
to
bed
roger
put
down
his
paper
look
here
edith
he
proposed
how
you
like
me
to
read
aloud
while
you
sew
she
looked
up
with
a
smile
of
pleased
surprise
why
father
dear
i
love
it
at
once
she
bent
over
her
needle
again
so
that
if
there
were
any
awkwardness
attending
this
small
change
in
their
lives
it
did
not
reveal
itself
in
her
pretty
countenance
what
shall
we
read
she
affably
asked
i
got
a
capital
book
he
replied
it
about
travel
in
japan
i
like
nothing
better
edith
replied
and
with
a
slight
glow
of
pride
in
himself
roger
took
his
book
in
hand
the
experiment
was
a
decided
success
he
read
again
the
next
night
and
the
next
while
edith
sat
at
her
sewing
and
so
this
hour
companionship
from
nine
to
ten
in
the
evening
became
a
regular
custom
just
one
hour
and
no
more
which
roger
spent
with
his
daughter
intimately
and
pleasantly
yes
life
was
certainly
smoothing
out
edith
three
older
children
had
been
reinstated
in
school
and
although
at
first
when
deprived
of
their
aid
she
had
found
it
nearly
impossible
to
keep
her
two
small
boys
amused
and
give
them
besides
the
four
hours
a
day
of
fresh
air
they
required
she
had
soon
met
this
trouble
by
the
same
simple
process
as
before
of
her
few
possessions
still
unsold
she
had
disposed
of
nearly
all
and
with
a
small
fund
thus
secured
she
had
sent
for
hannah
to
return
the
house
was
running
beautifully
christmas
too
was
drawing
near
and
though
roger
knew
that
in
heart
was
a
cold
dread
of
this
season
she
bravely
kept
it
to
herself
and
she
set
about
so
determinedly
to
make
a
merry
holiday
that
her
father
admiring
her
pluck
drew
closer
still
to
his
daughter
he
entered
into
her
christmas
plans
and
into
all
the
conspiracies
which
were
whispered
about
the
house
great
secrets
anxious
consultations
found
in
him
a
ready
listener
so
passed
three
blessed
quiet
weeks
and
he
had
high
hopes
for
the
winter
chapter
xxxi
if
there
were
any
cloud
upon
his
horizon
it
was
the
thought
of
laura
she
had
barely
been
to
the
house
since
edith
had
come
back
to
town
and
at
times
especially
in
the
days
when
things
had
looked
dark
for
roger
he
had
caught
himself
reproaching
this
youngest
child
so
engrossed
in
her
small
ménage
that
apparently
she
could
not
spare
a
thought
for
her
widowed
sister
laura
on
her
return
from
abroad
had
brought
as
a
gift
for
edith
a
mourning
gown
from
paris
a
most
alluring
creation
so
much
so
in
fact
that
edith
had
felt
it
simply
indecent
insulting
and
had
returned
it
to
her
sister
with
a
stilted
note
of
thanks
but
roger
did
not
know
of
this
there
were
so
many
ways
he
thought
in
which
laura
might
have
been
nice
to
edith
she
had
a
gorgeous
limousine
in
which
she
might
so
easily
have
come
and
taken
her
sister
off
on
little
trips
uptown
but
no
she
kept
her
car
to
herself
and
from
her
small
apartment
where
a
maid
whom
she
had
brought
from
rome
dressed
her
several
times
each
day
that
limousine
rushed
her
noiselessly
forth
gay
and
wild
as
ever
immaculate
and
elegant
radiant
and
very
rich
to
what
places
did
she
go
what
new
friends
was
she
making
what
was
laura
up
to
he
did
not
like
her
manner
one
evening
when
she
came
to
the
house
as
he
helped
her
off
with
her
cloak
a
sleek
supple
leopard
skin
which
fitted
her
figure
like
a
glove
he
asked
where
hal
this
evening
and
she
answered
lightly
oh
do
ask
what
he
does
with
himself
you
mean
i
suppose
said
edith
with
quiet
disapproval
that
he
is
rushed
to
death
this
year
with
all
this
business
from
the
war
yes
it
business
laura
replied
as
she
deftly
smoothed
and
patted
her
soft
abundant
reddish
hair
and
it
war
too
she
added
what
do
you
mean
her
father
asked
he
knew
what
she
meant
war
with
her
husband
but
before
laura
could
answer
him
edith
cut
in
hastily
for
two
of
her
children
were
present
at
dinner
she
turned
the
talk
to
the
war
but
even
on
this
topic
laura
remarks
were
disturbing
she
did
not
consider
the
war
wholly
bad
by
no
means
it
had
many
good
points
it
was
clearing
away
a
lot
of
old
rubbish
customs
superstitions
and
institutions
out
of
date
musty
old
relics
she
called
them
she
spoke
as
though
repeating
what
someone
else
had
told
her
laura
with
her
chicken
mind
could
never
have
thought
it
all
out
by
herself
when
asked
what
she
meant
she
was
smilingly
vague
with
a
glance
at
edith
youngsters
but
she
threw
out
hints
about
the
church
and
even
christianity
as
though
it
were
falling
to
pieces
she
spoke
of
a
second
renaissance
a
glorious
pagan
era
coming
and
then
she
exploded
a
little
bomb
by
inquiring
of
edith
what
do
you
think
the
girls
over
there
are
going
to
do
for
husbands
with
half
the
marriageable
men
either
killed
or
hopelessly
damaged
they
not
going
to
be
nuns
all
their
lives
again
her
sister
cut
her
off
and
the
rest
of
the
brief
evening
was
decidedly
awkward
yes
she
was
changing
growing
fast
and
roger
did
not
like
it
here
she
was
spending
money
like
water
absorbed
in
her
pleasures
having
no
baby
apparently
at
loose
ends
with
her
husband
and
through
it
all
so
cocksure
of
herself
and
her
outrageous
views
about
war
and
smiling
about
them
with
such
an
air
and
in
her
whole
manner
such
a
tone
of
amused
superiority
she
talked
about
a
world
for
the
strong
bits
of
gabble
from
nietzsche
and
that
sort
of
rot
she
spoke
blithely
of
a
rome
reborn
the
wings
of
the
eagles
heard
again
this
part
of
it
she
had
taken
no
doubt
from
her
new
italian
friend
her
husband
shrapnel
partner
pshaw
what
was
laura
up
to
but
that
was
only
one
evening
it
was
not
repeated
another
month
went
quickly
by
and
roger
had
soon
shaken
it
from
him
for
he
had
troubles
enough
at
home
one
daughter
at
a
time
he
had
thought
and
as
the
dark
clouds
close
above
him
had
cleared
the
other
cloud
too
had
drifted
away
until
it
was
small
just
on
the
horizon
far
away
from
roger
house
what
was
laura
up
to
he
barely
ever
thought
of
that
now
but
one
night
when
he
came
home
edith
who
sat
in
the
living
room
reading
aloud
to
her
smaller
boys
gave
him
a
significant
look
which
warned
him
something
had
happened
and
turning
to
take
off
his
overcoat
in
the
hall
he
almost
stumbled
upon
a
pile
of
hand
luggage
two
smart
patent
leather
bags
a
hat
trunk
and
a
sable
cloak
hello
he
exclaimed
what
this
who
here
laura
edith
answered
she
up
in
deborah
room
i
think
they
been
up
there
for
over
an
hour
roger
looked
indignantly
in
at
his
daughter
what
has
happened
he
asked
i
afraid
i
ca
tell
you
edith
replied
they
did
seem
to
need
me
they
made
it
rather
plain
in
fact
another
quarrel
i
presume
she
came
into
the
house
like
a
whirlwind
asked
at
once
for
deborah
and
flew
up
to
deborah
room
pshaw
roger
heavily
mounted
the
stairs
he
at
least
did
not
feel
like
flying
a
whirlwind
eh
a
nice
evening
ahead
meanwhile
in
her
room
upstairs
deborah
sat
motionless
sternly
holding
her
feelings
down
while
in
a
tone
now
kindly
but
more
often
full
of
a
sharp
dismay
she
threw
out
question
after
question
to
laura
who
was
walking
the
floor
in
a
quick
feverish
sort
of
way
with
gestures
half
hysterical
her
voice
bursting
with
emotions
of
mingled
fright
and
rage
no
this
time
it
divorce
she
declared
at
the
end
of
her
first
outburst
in
which
she
had
told
in
fragments
of
her
husband
double
life
i
stood
it
long
enough
i
through
you
mean
you
do
care
for
him
deborah
said
she
was
fighting
for
time
to
think
it
out
you
want
a
divorce
very
well
laura
dear
but
how
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
get
it
the
laws
are
rather
strict
in
this
state
they
allow
but
one
cause
have
you
any
proofs
no
i
have
but
i
do
need
any
proofs
he
wants
it
as
badly
as
i
do
wait
i
give
you
his
very
words
laura
face
grew
white
with
fury
entirely
up
to
you
sweetie
the
beast
can
have
any
kind
of
divorce
you
like
you
can
let
me
bring
suit
on
the
quiet
or
you
can
try
to
fight
me
in
court
climb
up
into
the
witness
chair
in
front
of
the
reporters
and
tell
them
all
about
yourself
husband
is
to
bring
suit
against
deborah
voice
was
loud
and
harsh
for
god

enough
men
any
longer

this
tirade
and
tell
me
exactly
what
you

deborah
interrupted
a
simple
course
of
action
had
just
flashed
into
her
mind
all
right
i
will
i
not
ashamed
i
given
you
this
to
show
you
exactly
how
i
feel
that

any
question
of
sin
or
guilt
or
any
musty
old
rubbish
like
that
i
know
i
right
i
know
just
what
i
doing

the
minute

my
beast
of
a
husband
and
your
husband
will
keep
his
suit
quiet
you
said
if
you
agree
not
to
fight
him
yes
deborah
rose
abruptly
then
will
you
stay
right
here
and
leave
this
matter
to
me
she
asked
what
do
mean
to
do
see
your
husband
what
for
when
if
i
can
i
want
to
be
sure
laura
looked
for
the
moment
nonplussed
and
what
of
my
wishes
she
inquired
wishes
said
deborah
steadily
you
want
a
divorce
do
you
so
do
i
and
you
want
it
quiet
and
so
do
i
want
it
so
hard
that
i
want
to
make
sure
deborah
tone
was
kinder
now
and
she
came
over
close
to
her
sister
look
here
laura
if
i
been
hard
forgive
me
please
and
let
me
help
i
not
so
narrow
as
you
think
i
been
through
a
good
deal
of
this
before
downtown
i
mean
with
girls
in
my
school
they
come
to
me
we
have
long
talks
maybe
i
a
nun
as
you
say
but
i
one
with
a
confessional
not
for
sins
she
added
as
laura
looked
up
angrily
sins
do
interest
me
very
much
but
troubles
do
and
heaven
knows
that
marriage
is
one
she
said
with
a
curious
bitterness
and
when
it
has
failed
and
there
no
love
left
as
in
your
case
i
for
divorce
only
her
wide
sensitive
lips
quivered
just
a
little
i
sorry
it
had
to
come
like
this
but
i
love
you
dear
and
i
want
to
help
i
want
to
see
you
safely
through
and
while
i
doing
it
if
we
can
i
want
to
keep
dad
out
of
it
at
least
until
it
settled
she
paused
a
moment
so
if
you
agree
i
go
to
your
husband
i
want
to
be
sure
absolutely
just
what
we
can
count
on
and
until
i
come
back
stay
here
in
my
room
you
do
want
to
talk
to
father
and
edith
most
certainly
not
laura
muttered
good
then
stay
here
until
i
return
i
send
you
up
some
supper
i
do
want
any
thank
you
laura
went
and
threw
herself
on
the
bed
while
her
sister
finished
dressing
it
decent
of
you
deborah
her
voice
was
muffled
and
relaxed
i
fair
she
added
i
sorry
for
some
of
the
things
i
said
about
me
and
marriage
deborah
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
in
a
peculiar
searching
way
a
slight
spasm
crossed
her
features
i
not
sure
but
that
you
were
right
at
times
i
feel
far
from
certain
she
said
laura
lifted
her
head
from
the
pillow
watched
her
sister
a
moment
dropped
back
do
let
this
affect
deborah
oh
do
worry
dearie
and
deborah
moved
toward
the
door
my
affair
is
just
mine
you
see
and
this
wo
make
any
difference
but
in
her
heart
she
knew
it
would
what
an
utter
loathing
she
had
for
all
that
people
meant
by
sex
suddenly
she
was
quivering
her
limbs
and
her
whole
body
hot
you
say
i
cold
she
was
thinking
cold
toward
allan
calm
and
cool
nothing
but
mind
and
reason
you
say
it
means
little
to
me
all
that
but
if
i
had
had
trouble
with
allan
would
i
have
come
running
home
to
talk
would
i
have
hugged
it
tight
and
is
that
love
what
do
know
of
me
and
the
life
i
led
do
you
know
how
it
feels
to
want
to
work
to
be
something
yourself
without
any
man
and
ca
be
a
passion
have
you
had
to
live
with
edith
here
and
see
what
motherhood
can
be
what
it
can
do
to
a
woman
and
now
you
come
with
side
just
as
narrow
as
hers
devouring
everything
else
in
sight
and
because
i
a
little
afraid
of
that
for
myself
and
all
i
want
to
do
you
say
i
do
know
what
love
is
but
i
do
and
my
love
worth
more
than
yours
it
deeper
richer
it
will
last
then
why
do
i
loathe
it
but
i
do
i
only
loathe
side
but
yours
is
the
very
heart
of
it
all
right
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
she
was
going
slowly
down
the
stairs
she
stopped
for
a
moment
frowning
chapter
xxxii
on
the
floor
below
she
met
her
father
who
was
coming
out
of
his
room
he
looked
at
her
keenly
what
the
trouble
laura
here
she
answered
trouble
again
with
her
husband
better
leave
her
alone
for
the
present
she
going
to
stay
in
my
room
for
a
while
very
well
her
father
grunted
and
they
went
down
to
dinner
there
deborah
was
silent
and
edith
did
most
of
the
talking
edith
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
laura
and
all
laura
ways
were
in
disgrace
for
the
moment
and
that
she
and
her
ways
with
her
children
shone
by
the
comparison
was
bright
and
sweet
and
tactful
roger
glanced
at
her
more
than
once
with
approval
and
with
gratitude
for
the
effort
she
was
making
to
smooth
over
the
situation
deborah
rose
before
they
had
finished
where
are
you
off
to
roger
asked
oh
there
something
i
have
to
attend
to
school
again
this
evening
dear
inquired
edith
cheerfully
but
her
sister
was
already
out
of
the
room
she
looked
at
her
father
with
quiet
concern
i
sorry
she
has
to
be
out
of
all
nights
she
murmured
humph
ejaculated
her
father
this
school
business
of
was
beginning
to
get
on
his
nerves
yes
just
a
little
on
his
nerves
why
could
she
give
up
one
evening
just
one
and
get
laura
out
of
this
snarl
she
was
in
he
heard
her
at
the
telephone
and
presently
she
came
back
to
them
oh
edith
she
said
casually
do
send
any
supper
up
to
laura
she
says
she
does
want
any
and
ask
hannah
to
put
a
cot
in
my
room
will
you
yes
dear
i
attend
to
it
thanks
and
again
she
left
them
in
silence
when
the
front
door
closed
edith
looked
at
her
father
this
must
be
rather
serious
roger
thought
excitedly
so
laura
was
to
stay
all
night
while
deborah
gallivanted
off
to
those
infernal
schools
of
hers
he
had
little
joy
in
his
paper
that
night
the
news
of
the
world
had
such
a
trick
of
suddenly
receding
a
million
miles
away
from
a
man
the
minute
he
was
in
trouble
and
roger
was
in
trouble
with
each
slow
tick
of
the
clock
in
the
hall
he
grew
more
certain
and
more
disturbed
an
hour
passed
the
clock
struck
nine
with
a
snort
he
tossed
his
paper
aside
well
edith
he
said
glumly
how
about
some
chess
this
evening
in
answer
she
gave
him
a
quick
smile
of
understanding
and
sympathy
all
right
father
dear
and
she
fetched
the
board
but
they
had
played
only
a
short
time
when
deborah
latchkey
was
heard
in
the
door
roger
gave
an
angry
hitch
to
his
chair
soon
she
appeared
in
the
doorway
may
i
talk
to
you
father
she
asked
i
suppose
so
roger
scowled
you
excuse
us
edith
she
added
oh
assuredly
dear
and
edith
rose
looking
very
much
hurt
of
course
if
i
not
needed
at
this
her
father
scowled
again
why
could
deborah
show
her
sister
a
little
consideration
what
is
it
he
demanded
suppose
we
go
into
the
study
she
said
he
followed
her
there
and
shut
the
door
well
he
asked
from
his
big
leather
chair
deborah
had
remained
standing
i
got
some
bad
news
she
began
what
is
it
he
snapped
school
burnt
down
savagely
he
bit
off
a
cigar
i
just
had
a
talk
with
harold
she
told
him
he
shot
a
glance
of
surprise
and
dismay
have
eh
what
it
all
about
it
about
a
divorce
she
answered
the
lighted
match
dropped
from
roger
hand
he
snatched
it
up
before
it
was
out
and
lit
his
cigar
and
puffing
smoke
in
a
vigilant
way
again
he
eyed
his
daughter
i
done
what
i
could
she
said
painfully
but
they
seem
to
have
made
up
their
minds
then
they
unmake
he
replied
and
he
leaned
forward
heavily
they
unmake
he
repeated
in
a
thick
unnatural
tone
i
not
to
hear
to
it
in
a
curious
manner
his
voice
had
changed
it
sounded
like
that
of
a
man
in
the
mountains
where
he
had
been
born
and
raised
this
thought
flashed
into
deborah
mind
and
her
wide
resolute
mouth
set
hard
it
would
be
very
difficult
i
afraid
this
wo
do
father
dear
whether
you
give
your
consent
or
not
wu
wu
it
you
wait
and
see
if
it
wu
deborah
came
close
to
him
suppose
you
wait
till
you
understand
she
admonished
sternly
all
right
i
waiting
he
replied
she
felt
herself
trembling
deep
inside
she
did
not
want
him
to
understand
any
more
than
she
must
to
induce
him
to
keep
out
of
this
affair
to
begin
with
she
said
steadily
you
will
soon
see
yourself
i
think
that
they
fairly
loathe
the
sight
of
each
other
that
there
is
no
real
marriage
left
that
fiddlesticks
snapped
roger
just
modern
talk
and
new
ideas
ideas
you
to
blame
for
yes
you
are
you
put
in
her
head
you
and
your
gabble
about
woman
rights
he
was
angry
now
he
was
glad
he
was
angry
he
just
begun
if
you
want
me
to
leave
her
alone
his
daughter
cut
in
sharply
just
say
so
i
leave
it
all
to
you
and
she
saw
him
flinch
a
little
what
would
be
idea
she
asked
my
idea
she
to
go
straight
home
and
make
up
with
him
she
hesitated
then
she
said
suppose
there
another
woman
then
he
a
beast
growled
roger
and
yet
you
want
her
to
live
with
him
he
scowled
he
felt
baffled
his
mind
in
a
whirl
and
a
wave
of
exasperation
suddenly
swept
over
him
well
why
should
she
he
cried
other
wives
have
done
it
millions
made
a
devilish
good
success
of
it
too
made
new
men
of
their
husbands
let
her
show
him
she
ready
to
forgive
that
only
christian
ai
it
hard
of
course
it
hard
on
her
but
can
you
tell
me
one
hard
thing
she
has
ever
had
to
do
in
her
life
has
it
been
pleasure
pleasure
from
the
word
go
ca
she
stand
something
hard
do
we
all
of
us
have
to
i
do
god
knows
with
all
of
you
and
he
puffed
his
cigar
in
a
fury
his
daughter
smiled
she
saw
her
chance
father
she
said
in
a
low
clear
voice
you
had
so
troubles
why
not
leave
this
one
to
me
you
ca
help
no
matter
how
hard
you
try
you
only
make
it
worse
and
worse
and
you
been
through
so
much
this
year
you
earned
the
right
to
be
quiet
and
that
what
want
both
of
them
they
both
want
it
quiet
without
any
scandal
her
father
glared
for
he
knew
about
scandal
he
handled
it
in
his
office
each
day
let
me
manage
this
please
she
said
and
her
offer
tempted
him
he
struggled
for
a
moment
no
i
wo
he
burst
out
in
reply
i
want
quiet
right
enough
but
not
at
the
price
of
her
peace
with
her
god
this
sounded
foolish
he
felt
that
it
did
and
he
flushed
and
grew
the
angrier
no
i
wo
he
said
stubbornly
she
go
back
to
him
if
i
take
her
myself
and
what
more
he
added
rising
she
to
go
straight
back
she
is
not
going
back
my
dear
and
deborah
caught
her
arm
sit
down
please
i
heard
enough
i
afraid
you
have
she
replied
very
well
his
smile
was
caustic
give
me
some
more
of
it
he
said
her
husband
wo
have
her
said
deborah
bluntly
he
told
me
so
himself
did
eh
then
talk
to
him
he
thinks
she
went
on
in
a
desperate
tone
that
laura
has
been
leading
own
little
life
as
he
put
it
to
me
he
is
bringing
suit
himself
he
cried
roger
hoarsely
then
i
talk
to
this
young
man
but
she
put
out
a
restraining
hand
father
do
try
to
fight
this
suit
you
watch
me
he
snarled
tears
showed
in
her
eyes
think
oh
please
think
what
you
doing
have
you
ever
seen
a
here
in
new
york
do
you
know
what
it
like
what
it
be
like
yes
roger
panted
he
did
know
and
the
picture
came
vividly
into
his
mind
a
mass
of
eager
devouring
eyes
fixed
on
a
girl
in
a
witness
chair
i
see
a
lawyer
he
said
no
you
wo
do
that
my
dear
deborah
told
him
sadly
laura
husband
has
got
proofs
her
father
looked
up
slowly
and
glared
into
his
daughter
face
i
seen
them
myself
she
added
and
laura
has
admitted
it
too
still
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
her
then
slowly
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
his
eyes
dropped
in
their
sockets
and
very
carefully
with
a
hand
which
was
trembling
visibly
he
lifted
his
cigar
to
his
lips
it
had
gone
nearly
out
but
he
drew
on
it
hard
until
it
began
to
glow
again
well
he
asked
simply
what
shall
we
do
sharply
deborah
turned
away
to
be
quiet
to
be
matter
of
fact
to
act
as
though
nothing
had
happened
at
all
she
knew
this
was
what
he
wanted
now
what
he
was
silently
begging
her
to
be
for
his
sake
for
the
family
sake
for
he
had
been
raised
in
new
england
and
so
when
she
turned
back
to
him
her
voice
was
flat
and
commonplace
keep
her
here
she
said
let
him
do
what
he
likes
there
be
nothing
noisy
he
promised
me
that
but
keep
her
here
till
it
over
roger
smoked
for
a
moment
and
said
there
edith
and
her
children
the
children
need
know
anything
and
edith
only
part
of
it
the
less
the
better
he
grunted
of
course
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
this
tractable
mood
of
his
might
not
last
why
not
go
up
and
see
her
now
and
get
it
all
over
so
you
can
sleep
over
roger
set
heavy
visage
flitted
a
smile
of
grim
relish
at
that
sleep
deborah
was
funny
resolutely
he
rose
from
his
chair
you
be
careful
of
course
she
admonished
him
and
he
nodded
in
reply
at
the
door
he
turned
back
where
the
other
chap
i
do
know
she
answered
surely
you
do
want
to
see
her
father
snorted
his
contempt
see
him
no
nor
she
neither
not
to
see
him
understand
i
would
tell
her
that
look
here
roger
eyed
his
daughter
a
moment
you
done
well
i
no
complaint
but
do
try
to
manage
everything
he
went
out
and
slowly
climbed
the
stairs
outside
the
bedroom
door
he
paused
when
had
he
stood
like
this
before
in
a
moment
he
remembered
one
evening
some
two
years
ago
the
night
before
laura
wedding
when
they
had
had
that
other
talk
and
so
it
had
come
to
this
had
it
well
there
was
no
use
making
a
scene
again
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
laura
father
knocked
at
her
door
come
in
deborah
she
said
it
is
deborah
it
i
there
was
a
little
silence
very
well
father
come
in
please
her
voice
sounded
tired
and
lifeless
he
opened
the
door
and
found
the
room
dark
i
over
on
the
bed
she
said
i
had
a
headache
this
evening
he
came
over
to
the
bedside
and
he
could
just
see
her
there
a
long
shadow
upon
the
white
she
had
not
taken
off
her
clothes
he
stood
a
moment
helplessly
please
do
talk
to
me
his
daughter
fiercely
whispered
i
stand
any
more
i
wo
he
answered
it
too
late
again
there
was
a
pause
what
time
is
it
she
asked
him
but
he
did
not
answer
well
laura
he
said
presently
your
sister
has
told
me
everything
she
has
seen
your
husband
it
all
arranged
and
you
to
stay
here
till
over
you
want
to
stay
here
do
you
yes
then
it
settled
he
went
on
there
only
one
thing
the
other
man
i
do
know
who
he
is
and
i
do
want
to
know
and
i
do
want
you
to
know
him
again
you
not
to
see
him
understand
for
a
moment
laura
was
silent
i
going
to
marry
him
father
she
said
and
standing
in
the
darkened
room
roger
stiffened
sharply
well
he
answered
after
a
pause
that
your
affair
you
no
longer
a
child
i
wish
you
were
he
added
suddenly
in
the
darkness
laura
hand
came
out
clutching
for
his
but
he
had
already
turned
to
the
door
he
said
and
left
her
in
the
hallway
below
he
met
deborah
and
to
her
questioning
look
he
replied
all
right
i
guess
now
i
going
to
bed
he
went
into
his
room
and
closed
the
door
as
soon
as
roger
was
alone
he
knew
this
was
the
hardest
part
to
be
here
by
himself
in
this
intimate
room
with
this
worn
blue
rug
these
pictures
and
this
old
mahogany
bed
for
he
had
promised
judith
his
wife
to
keep
close
to
the
children
what
would
she
think
of
him
if
she
knew
judith
had
been
a
woman
sensible
but
she
never
would
have
stood
for
this
once
he
recollected
she
had
helped
a
girl
friend
to
divorce
her
husband
a
drunkard
who
ran
after
chorus
girls
but
that
had
been
quite
different
there
the
wife
had
been
innocent
and
had
done
it
for
her
children
laura
was
guilty
she
had
a
child
she
was
already
planning
to
marry
again
and
then
what
he
asked
himself
from
bad
to
worse
very
likely
a
woman
ca
stop
when
she
started
downhill
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
picture
directly
before
him
on
the
wall
the
one
his
wife
had
given
him
two
herdsmen
with
their
cattle
high
up
on
a
shoulder
of
a
sweeping
mountain
side
tiny
blue
figures
against
the
dawn
it
had
been
like
a
symbol
of
their
lives
always
beginning
clean
glorious
days
what
was
laura
beginning
well
he
demanded
angrily
as
he
began
to
jerk
off
his
clothes
what
can
i
do
about
it
try
to
keep
her
from
eh
and
suppose
i
succeeded
how
long
would
it
last
she
would
stay
here
and
i
keep
her
she
be
independent
now
her
looks
will
be
her
bank
account
there
be
some
other
chap
in
no
time
and
he
might
not
even
marry
her
he
tugged
ferociously
at
his
boots
no
let
well
enough
alone
he
finished
undressing
opened
the
window
turned
out
the
gas
and
got
into
bed
wearily
he
closed
his
eyes
but
after
a
time
he
opened
them
and
stared
long
through
the
window
up
at
the
beetling
cliff
of
a
building
close
by
with
its
tier
upon
tier
of
lighted
apartments
a
huge
garish
hive
of
homes
yes
the
town
was
crowding
down
on
him
on
his
house
and
on
his
family
he
realized
it
had
never
stopped
and
that
his
three
grown
children
each
one
of
them
a
part
of
himself
had
been
struggling
with
it
all
the
time
laura
was
she
part
of
himself
had
he
too
had
his
little
fling
back
in
his
early
twenties
you
will
live
on
in
our
children
lives
she
was
a
part
of
him
gone
wild
she
gave
it
free
rein
took
chances
god
what
a
chance
she
had
taken
this
time
the
picture
of
that
court
he
had
seen
with
the
girl
in
the
witness
chair
and
those
many
rows
of
eyes
avidly
fixed
upon
her
came
back
to
his
mind
so
vividly
they
seemed
for
a
moment
right
here
in
the
room
these
eyes
of
the
town
boring
into
his
house
angrily
he
shut
out
the
scene
and
alone
in
the
darkness
roger
said
to
his
daughter
all
the
ugly
furious
things
he
had
not
said
to
her
upstairs
until
at
last
he
was
weary
of
it
why
am
i
working
myself
all
up
i
got
to
take
this
it
my
medicine
chapter
xxxiii
but
as
he
watched
laura
in
the
house
roger
first
emotions
were
complicated
more
and
more
by
a
feeling
of
bewilderment
at
dinner
the
next
evening
he
noticed
with
astonishment
that
she
appeared
like
her
natural
self
she
acting
he
decided
but
this
explanation
he
soon
dismissed
no
it
was
something
deeper
she
was
actually
unashamed
unafraid
that
first
display
of
feelings
the
night
of
her
arrival
had
been
only
the
scare
of
an
hour
within
a
few
days
she
was
back
on
her
feet
and
her
cure
for
her
trouble
if
trouble
she
felt
was
not
less
but
more
pleasure
as
always
she
went
out
nearly
every
evening
now
and
when
she
had
spent
what
money
she
had
she
sold
a
part
of
her
jewelry
to
the
little
old
galician
jew
in
the
shop
around
the
corner
yes
she
was
her
natural
self
and
she
was
as
before
to
her
father
her
attitude
said
plainly
it
is
fair
to
you
poor
dear
to
expect
you
to
fully
understand
how
right
i
am
in
this
affair
and
considering
your
point
of
view
acting
very
nicely
often
as
she
talked
to
him
a
note
of
forgiveness
crept
into
his
daughter
voice
and
looking
at
her
grimly
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
that
she
looked
down
on
him
far
far
down
from
heights
above
yes
he
thought
this
is
modern
then
he
grew
angry
all
at
once
no
he
added
this
is
wrong
you
ca
fool
me
young
woman
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
myself
you
not
going
to
carry
this
off
with
an
air
not
with
your
father
no
by
george
and
he
would
grow
abrupt
and
stern
but
days
would
pass
and
in
spite
of
himself
into
their
talks
would
creep
a
natural
friendly
tone
again
he
found
himself
friends
with
her
friends
as
though
nothing
whatever
had
happened
could
it
be
that
a
woman
who
had
so
sinned
could
go
right
on
here
was
laura
serenely
unconscious
of
guilt
and
smiling
into
her
future
dreaming
still
of
happiness
quite
plainly
sure
of
it
in
fact
with
a
curious
dismayed
relief
roger
would
scowl
at
this
daughter
of
his
a
radiant
enigma
in
his
quiet
sober
house
but
edith
was
not
at
all
perplexed
when
she
learned
from
deborah
that
there
was
soon
to
be
a
divorce
she
came
at
once
to
her
father
her
face
was
like
a
thundercloud
a
nice
example
for
my
children
she
indignantly
exclaimed
i
sorry
my
dear
but
what
can
i
do
you
can
make
her
go
back
to
her
husband
ca
you
no
i
ca
he
flatly
replied
then
i
better
try
it
myself
you
do
no
such
thing
he
retorted
i
gone
clear
to
the
bottom
of
this
and
i
say
you
to
leave
her
alone
very
well
she
answered
and
she
did
leave
her
sister
alone
so
severely
that
laura
soon
avoided
being
home
for
lunch
or
dinner
she
had
taken
the
room
which
george
had
occupied
ever
since
john
had
been
turned
out
and
there
she
breakfasted
late
in
bed
until
edith
put
a
stop
to
it
they
barely
spoke
to
each
other
now
laura
still
smiled
defiance
days
passed
christmas
came
at
last
and
despite
edith
glum
resolution
to
make
it
a
happy
time
for
the
children
the
happiness
soon
petered
out
after
the
tree
in
the
morning
the
day
hung
heavy
on
the
house
roger
buried
himself
in
his
study
laura
had
motored
off
into
the
country
with
a
gay
party
of
her
friends
or
was
this
just
a
ruse
he
wondered
and
was
she
spending
the
day
with
her
lover
well
what
if
she
was
could
he
lock
her
in
about
twilight
he
thought
he
heard
her
return
and
later
from
his
bedroom
he
heard
her
voice
and
edith
both
voices
sounded
angry
but
he
would
not
interfere
at
the
christmas
dinner
that
evening
laura
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
but
edith
sat
stiff
and
silent
there
and
despite
the
obvious
efforts
which
deborah
and
allan
made
to
be
genial
with
the
children
the
very
air
in
the
room
was
charged
with
the
feeling
of
trouble
close
ahead
again
roger
retreated
into
his
den
and
presently
laura
came
to
him
i
going
out
she
said
and
she
pressed
her
cheek
lightly
to
his
own
what
a
dear
you
been
to
me
dad
she
murmured
and
then
she
was
gone
a
few
minutes
later
edith
came
in
she
held
a
small
note
in
her
hand
which
roger
saw
was
addressed
to
himself
well
father
i
learned
this
afternoon
what
you
been
keeping
from
me
she
said
roger
gave
her
a
steady
look
you
did
eh
laura
told
you
yes
she
did
his
daughter
exclaimed
and
i
ca
help
wondering
father
why
did
she
tell
you
have
you
been
at
her
again
again
not
at
all
she
answered
i
done
as
you
asked
me
to
let
her
alone
but
mother
day
i
got
thinking
of
leave
your
mother
out
of
it
please
what
did
you
say
to
laura
i
tried
to
make
her
go
back
of
course
and
she
told
you
he
would
have
her
and
then
in
a
perfect
tantrum
she
went
on
to
tell
me
why
edith
eyes
were
cold
with
disgust
and
i
wondering
why
you
let
her
stay
here
in
the
same
house
with
my
children
roger
reached
out
his
hand
give
me
that
note
he
commanded
he
read
it
quickly
and
handed
it
back
the
note
was
from
laura
a
hasty
edith
will
explain
she
wrote
and
you
will
see
i
can
not
stay
any
longer
it
is
simply
too
impossible
i
am
going
to
the
man
i
love
and
in
a
few
days
we
shall
sail
for
naples
i
know
you
will
not
interfere
it
will
make
the
divorce
even
simpler
and
everything
easier
all
round
please
worry
about
me
we
shall
soon
be
married
over
there
you
have
been
so
dear
and
sensible
and
i
do
so
love
you
for
it
then
came
her
name
scrawled
hastily
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
i
have
paid
every
bill
i
can
think
of
edith
read
it
in
silence
her
color
slowly
mounting
all
right
said
her
father
your
children
are
safe
she
gave
him
a
quick
angry
look
burst
into
tears
and
ran
out
of
the
room
roger
sat
without
moving
his
heavy
face
impassive
and
so
he
remained
for
a
long
time
well
was
gone
no
mistake
about
that
and
this
time
she
was
gone
for
good
she
was
going
to
live
in
rome
try
to
stop
her
no
what
good
would
it
do
wings
of
the
eagles
rome
reborn
that
was
it
she
had
hit
it
struck
the
keynote
of
this
new
age
rome
reborn
all
clean
christian
living
swept
away
by
millions
of
men
at
each
others
throats
like
so
many
wolves
and
at
last
quite
openly
to
himself
roger
admitted
that
he
felt
old
old
and
beaten
out
of
date
moments
passed
and
hours
he
took
little
note
of
time
nor
did
he
see
on
the
mantle
the
dark
visage
of
the
thinker
there
resting
on
the
huge
clinched
fist
and
brooding
down
upon
him
lower
imperceptibly
he
sank
into
his
leather
chair
quiet
had
returned
to
his
house
chapter
xxxiv
but
the
quiet
was
dark
to
roger
now
each
night
he
spent
in
his
study
alone
for
instinctively
he
felt
the
need
of
being
by
himself
for
a
while
of
keeping
away
from
his
children
out
of
whose
lives
he
divined
that
other
events
would
soon
come
forth
to
use
up
the
last
of
the
strength
that
was
in
him
and
roger
grew
angry
with
the
world
why
could
it
let
a
man
alone
an
old
man
in
a
silent
house
alive
for
him
with
memories
repeatedly
in
such
hours
his
mind
would
go
groping
backward
into
the
years
behind
him
what
a
long
and
winding
road
half
buried
in
the
jungle
dim
almost
impenetrable
made
up
of
millions
of
small
events
small
worries
plans
and
dazzling
dreams
with
which
his
days
had
all
been
filled
but
the
more
he
recalled
the
more
certain
he
grew
that
he
was
right
life
had
never
been
like
this
the
world
had
never
come
smashing
into
his
house
his
very
family
with
its
dirty
teeming
tenements
its
schools
its
prisons
electric
chairs
its
feverish
rush
for
money
its
luxuries
its
scandals
these
things
had
existed
in
the
world
but
remote
and
never
real
mere
things
which
he
had
read
about
war
did
he
not
remember
wars
that
had
come
and
gone
in
europe
but
they
had
come
into
his
home
like
this
first
making
him
poor
when
he
needed
money
for
edith
and
her
children
then
plunging
deborah
into
a
struggle
which
might
very
probably
ruin
her
life
and
now
taking
laura
and
filling
her
mind
with
thoughts
of
pagan
living
why
was
every
man
woman
and
child
these
days
bound
up
in
the
whole
life
of
the
world
what
would
come
of
it
all
a
new
day
out
of
this
deafening
night
maybe
so
but
for
him
it
would
come
too
late
what
have
i
left
to
live
for
one
night
with
a
sigh
he
went
to
his
desk
lit
a
cigar
and
laid
his
hand
upon
a
pile
of
letters
which
had
been
mounting
steadily
it
was
made
up
of
laura
bills
the
ones
she
had
not
remembered
send
them
after
her
to
rome
for
that
italian
fellow
to
pay
no
it
could
not
be
thought
of
roger
turned
to
his
dwindling
bank
account
he
was
not
yet
making
money
he
was
still
losing
a
little
each
week
but
he
would
not
cut
expenses
to
the
few
who
were
left
in
his
employ
to
be
turned
away
would
mean
dire
need
and
angrily
he
determined
that
they
should
not
starve
to
pay
laura
bills
the
world
for
the
strong
eh
not
in
my
office
in
rome
or
berlin
or
vienna
all
right
but
not
over
here
grimly
when
he
had
made
out
the
checks
roger
eyed
his
balance
by
spring
he
would
be
penniless
and
he
had
no
one
to
turn
to
now
no
rich
young
who
could
aid
he
set
himself
doggedly
to
the
task
of
forcing
up
his
business
and
meanwhile
in
the
evenings
he
tried
with
edith
to
get
back
upon
their
former
footing
to
do
this
was
not
easy
at
first
for
his
bitterness
still
rankled
deep
when
you
were
in
trouble
i
took
you
in
but
when
she
was
in
trouble
you
turned
her
out
as
you
turned
out
john
before
her
in
the
room
again
vacated
young
george
had
been
reinstalled
one
night
edith
found
her
father
there
looking
in
through
the
open
doorway
and
the
look
on
his
massive
face
was
hard
better
have
the
room
disinfected
again
he
muttered
when
he
saw
her
he
turned
and
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
and
she
was
late
for
dinner
that
night
but
edith
had
her
children
and
as
he
watched
her
night
by
night
hearing
their
lessons
patiently
reading
them
fairy
stories
and
holding
them
smilingly
in
her
arms
the
old
appeal
of
her
motherhood
regained
its
hold
upon
him
one
evening
when
the
clock
struck
nine
putting
down
his
paper
he
suggested
gruffly
well
daughter
how
about
some
chess
edith
flushed
a
little
why
yes
dear
i
be
glad
to
she
rose
and
went
to
get
the
board
so
the
games
were
resumed
and
part
at
least
of
their
old
affection
came
to
life
but
only
a
part
it
could
never
be
quite
the
same
again
and
though
he
saw
little
of
deborah
slowly
almost
unawares
to
them
both
she
assumed
the
old
place
she
had
had
in
his
home
as
the
one
who
had
been
right
here
in
the
house
through
all
the
years
since
her
mother
had
died
the
one
who
had
helped
and
never
asked
help
keeping
her
own
troubles
to
herself
he
fell
back
into
his
habit
of
going
before
dinner
to
his
daughter
bedroom
door
to
ask
whether
she
would
be
home
that
night
at
one
such
time
getting
no
response
and
thinking
deborah
was
not
there
he
opened
the
door
part
way
to
make
sure
and
he
saw
her
at
her
dresser
staring
at
herself
in
the
glass
rigid
as
though
in
a
trance
later
in
the
dining
room
he
heard
her
step
upon
the
stairs
she
came
in
quietly
and
sat
down
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
she
said
her
and
left
the
house
but
when
she
came
home
at
midnight
he
was
waiting
up
for
her
he
had
foraged
in
the
kitchen
and
on
his
study
table
he
had
set
out
some
supper
while
she
sat
there
eating
her
father
watched
her
from
his
chair
things
going
badly
in
school
he
inquired
yes
she
replied
there
was
silence
what
wrong
we
had
a
line
of
mothers
reaching
out
into
the
street
they
had
come
for
food
and
coal
but
we
had
to
send
most
of
them
home
some
of
them
cried
and
one
of
them
fainted
she
to
have
a
baby
soon
ca
you
get
any
money
uptown
he
asked
i
have
she
answered
grimly
i
been
a
beggar
heaven
knows
on
every
friend
i
can
think
of
and
i
kept
a
press
agent
hard
at
work
trying
to
make
the
public
see
that
belgium
is
right
here
in
new
york
she
stopped
and
went
on
with
her
supper
but
it
a
bad
time
for
work
like
mine
she
continued
presently
if
we
to
keep
it
going
we
must
above
all
keep
it
cheap
that
the
keynote
these
days
keep
everything
cheap
at
any
cost
so
that
men
can
expensively
kill
one
another
her
voice
had
a
bitter
ring
to
it
you
try
to
talk
peace
and
they
bowl
you
over
with
facts
on
the
need
of
preparedness
for
the
defence
of
your
country
and
that
appeal
to
me
very
much
i
want
a
bigger
preparedness
for
the
defence
of
the
whole
world
for
democracy
and
human
rights
no
matter
who
the
people
are
i
like
to
train
every
child
to
that
what
do
you
mean
her
father
asked
to
teach
him
what
his
life
can
be
she
replied
in
a
hard
quivering
tone
a
fight
oh
yes
so
long
as
he
lives
and
even
with
guns
if
it
must
be
so
but
a
fight
for
all
the
people
on
earth
and
a
world
so
full
of
happy
lives
that
men
will
think
hard
before
ever
again
letting
themselves
be
led
by
the
nose
into
war
and
death
for
a
place
in
the
sun
she
rose
from
her
chair
with
a
weary
smile
here
i
am
making
a
speech
again
i
made
so
many
lately
it
become
a
habit
i
tired
out
dad
i
going
to
bed
her
father
looked
at
her
anxiously
you
seeing
things
out
of
proportion
he
said
you
worked
so
hard
you
getting
stale
you
ought
to
get
out
of
it
for
a
while
i
ca
she
answered
sharply
you
do
know
you
do
even
guess
how
it
takes
every
hour
all
the
demands
where
allan
these
days
working
was
her
harsh
reply
trying
to
keep
his
hospital
going
with
half
its
staff
the
woman
who
was
backing
him
is
giving
her
money
to
belgium
instead
do
you
see
much
of
him
every
day
let
drop
it
shall
we
all
right
my
dear
and
they
said
in
the
meantime
in
the
house
edith
had
tried
to
scrimp
and
save
but
it
was
very
difficult
her
children
had
so
many
needs
they
were
all
growing
up
so
fast
each
month
brought
fresh
demands
on
her
purse
and
the
fund
from
the
sale
of
her
belongings
had
been
used
up
long
ago
her
sole
resource
was
the
modest
allowance
her
father
gave
her
for
running
the
house
and
she
had
not
asked
him
for
more
she
had
put
off
trouble
from
month
to
month
but
one
evening
early
in
march
when
he
gave
her
the
regular
monthly
check
she
said
hesitatingly
i
very
sorry
father
dear
but
i
afraid
we
need
more
money
this
month
he
glanced
up
from
his
paper
what
the
matter
she
gave
him
a
forced
little
smile
and
her
father
noticed
the
gray
in
her
hair
oh
nothing
in
particular
goodness
knows
i
tried
to
keep
down
expenses
but
well
we
a
pretty
large
household
you
know
yes
said
roger
kindly
i
know
are
the
month
bills
in
yes
let
me
see
them
she
brought
him
the
bills
and
he
looked
relieved
not
so
many
he
ventured
no
but
they
large
why
look
here
edith
he
said
abruptly
these
are
bills
for
two
months
some
for
three
even
four
i
know
that
just
the
trouble
i
could
meet
them
at
the
time
why
did
you
tell
me
laura
was
here
and
i
did
want
to
bother
you
you
had
enough
on
your
mind
as
it
was
i
done
the
best
i
could
father
dear
i
sold
everything
you
know
but
i
about
come
to
the
end
of
my
rope
and
her
manner
said
clearly
i
done
my
part
i
only
a
woman
i
have
to
leave
the
rest
to
you
i
see
i
see
and
roger
knitted
his
heavy
brows
i
presume
i
can
get
it
somehow
this
would
play
the
very
devil
with
things
father
edith
voice
was
low
why
do
you
let
deborah
help
you
she
does
very
little
it
seems
to
me
compared
to
the
size
of
her
salary
she
ca
do
any
more
than
she
doing
now
was
his
decisive
answer
edith
looked
at
him
her
color
high
she
hesitated
then
burst
out
i
saw
her
check
book
the
other
day
she
had
left
it
on
the
table
spending
thousands
every
month
that
not
her
own
money
roger
said
no
it
money
she
gets
for
her
fads
her
work
for
those
tenement
children
she
can
get
money
enough
for
he
flung
out
his
hand
leave
her
out
of
this
please
very
well
father
just
as
you
say
and
she
sat
there
hurt
and
silent
while
again
he
looked
slowly
through
the
bills
he
jotted
down
figures
and
added
them
up
they
came
to
a
bit
over
nine
hundred
dollars
soon
key
was
heard
in
the
door
and
roger
scowled
the
deeper
she
came
into
the
room
but
he
did
not
look
up
he
heard
her
voice
what
the
matter
edith
bills
for
the
house
oh
and
deborah
came
to
her
father
may
i
see
what
the
trouble
dear
i
rather
you
would
it
nothing
he
growled
he
wanted
her
to
keep
out
of
this
why
should
she
see
edith
tartly
inquired
deborah
is
living
here
and
before
i
came
she
ran
the
house
in
her
place
i
should
certainly
want
to
know
deborah
was
already
glancing
rapidly
over
the
bills
why
edith
she
exclaimed
most
of
these
bills
go
back
for
months
why
did
you
pay
them
when
they
were
due
simply
because
i
had
the
money
you
had
the
regular
monthly
amount
that
did
last
long
why
did
you
tell
us
laura
was
here
deborah
gave
a
shrug
of
impatience
and
roger
saw
how
tired
she
was
her
nerves
on
edge
from
her
long
day
never
mind
about
it
now
he
put
in
what
a
pity
deborah
muttered
if
we
had
been
told
we
could
have
cut
down
i
do
agree
with
you
edith
rejoined
i
have
already
done
that
myself
i
done
nothing
else
have
the
servants
been
paid
her
sister
asked
no
they
since
when
three
months
roger
got
up
and
walked
the
room
deborah
tried
to
speak
quietly
i
ca
quite
see
where
the
money
has
gone
ca
you
then
look
at
my
check
book
and
edith
produced
it
with
a
glare
her
sister
turned
over
a
few
of
the
stubs
what
this
item
where
here
a
hundred
and
dollars
the
dentist
edith
answered
not
extravagant
is
it
for
five
children
i
see
said
deborah
and
this
bedding
was
edith
sharp
response
a
mattress
and
more
blankets
i
found
there
were
half
enough
in
the
house
you
burned
john
did
you
naturally
all
at
once
both
grew
ashamed
let
be
sensible
deborah
said
we
must
do
something
edith
and
we
ca
till
we
certain
where
we
stand
very
well
they
went
on
more
calmly
and
took
up
the
items
one
by
one
deborah
finished
and
was
silent
well
father
what
to
be
done
she
asked
i
do
know
he
answered
shortly
somehow
or
other
deborah
said
we
got
to
cut
our
expenses
down
i
afraid
that
impossible
edith
rejoined
i
already
cut
as
much
as
i
can
so
did
i
in
my
school
said
her
sister
and
when
i
thought
i
had
reached
the
end
i
called
in
an
expert
and
he
showed
me
ways
of
saving
i
had
never
dreamed
of
what
kind
of
expert
would
you
advise
here
edith
small
lip
curled
in
scorn
domestic
science
naturally
i
have
a
woman
who
does
nothing
else
she
shows
women
in
their
homes
just
how
to
make
money
count
the
most
what
women
and
what
homes
tenements
yes
she
one
of
my
teachers
thank
you
said
edith
indignantly
but
i
do
care
to
have
my
children
brought
down
to
tenement
standards
i
did
mean
to
them
but
i
know
she
could
show
you
a
great
many
things
you
can
buy
for
less
i
afraid
i
should
agree
with
her
why
not
edith
because
she
knows
only
tenement
children
nothing
of
children
bred
like
mine
deborah
drew
a
quick
short
breath
her
brows
drew
tight
and
she
looked
away
she
bit
her
lip
controlled
herself
very
well
i
try
again
this
house
is
plenty
large
enough
so
that
by
a
little
crowding
we
could
make
room
for
somebody
else
and
i
know
a
teacher
in
one
of
my
schools
who
be
only
too
glad
take
a
boarder
you
mean
yes
i
do
we
got
to
do
something
no
deborah
threw
up
her
hands
all
right
edith
i
through
she
said
now
what
do
you
propose
i
can
try
to
do
without
hannah
again
that
will
be
hard
on
all
of
us
but
i
guess
you
have
to
so
it
seems
but
unfortunately
that
wo
he
enough
edith
face
grew
tenser
i
afraid
it
will
have
to
be
just
now
i
had
about
all
i
can
stand
for
one
night
i
sorry
deborah
answered
for
a
moment
they
confronted
each
other
and
edith
look
said
to
deborah
plainly
you
spending
thousands
thousands
on
those
tenement
children
you
can
get
money
enough
for
them
but
you
wo
raise
a
hand
to
help
with
mine
and
as
plainly
deborah
answered
my
children
are
starving
shivering
freezing
what
do
yours
know
about
being
poor
two
mothers
each
with
a
family
and
each
one
baffled
brought
to
bay
there
was
something
so
insatiable
in
each
angry
mother
eyes
i
think
you
better
leave
this
to
me
said
roger
very
huskily
and
both
his
daughters
turned
with
a
start
as
though
in
their
bitter
absorption
they
had
forgotten
his
presence
there
both
flushed
and
now
the
glances
of
all
three
in
that
room
avoided
each
other
for
they
felt
how
sordid
it
had
been
deborah
turned
to
her
sister
i
sorry
edith
she
said
again
and
this
time
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
so
am
i
said
edith
unsteadily
and
in
a
moment
she
left
the
room
deborah
stood
watching
her
father
i
ashamed
of
myself
she
said
well
shall
we
talk
it
over
no
he
replied
i
can
manage
it
somehow
deborah
and
i
prefer
that
you
leave
it
to
me
roger
went
into
his
study
and
sank
grimly
into
his
chair
yes
it
had
been
pretty
bad
it
had
been
ugly
ominous
he
took
paper
and
pencil
and
set
to
work
how
he
had
come
to
hate
this
job
of
wrestling
with
figures
of
the
five
thousand
dollars
borrowed
in
august
he
had
barely
a
thousand
left
the
first
interest
was
due
next
week
and
must
be
paid
the
balance
would
carry
them
through
march
and
on
well
into
april
by
that
time
he
hoped
to
be
making
money
for
business
was
better
every
week
but
what
of
this
nine
hundred
dollars
in
debts
half
at
least
must
be
paid
at
once
lower
and
lower
he
sank
in
his
chair
but
a
few
moments
later
his
blunt
heavy
visage
cleared
and
with
a
little
sigh
of
relief
he
put
away
his
papers
turned
out
the
lights
and
went
upstairs
the
dark
house
felt
friendly
and
comforting
now
in
his
room
he
opened
the
safe
in
the
corner
where
his
collection
of
curious
rings
had
lain
unnoticed
for
many
months
he
drew
out
a
tray
sat
down
by
the
light
and
began
to
look
them
over
at
first
only
small
inanimate
objects
gradually
as
from
tray
after
tray
they
glittered
duskily
up
at
him
they
began
to
yield
their
riches
as
they
had
so
often
done
before
spanish
french
italian
bohemian
hungarian
russian
and
arabian
rings
small
and
rings
enormous
religious
rings
and
magic
rings
poison
rings
some
black
with
age
for
all
his
careful
polishing
again
they
stole
deep
into
roger
imagination
with
suggestions
of
the
many
hands
that
had
worn
them
through
the
centuries
of
women
kneeling
in
old
churches
couples
in
dark
crooked
streets
adventures
love
hate
jealousy
youth
and
fire
dreams
and
passion
at
last
he
remembered
why
he
was
here
he
thought
of
possible
purchasers
he
knew
so
many
dealers
but
he
knew
too
that
the
war
had
played
the
devil
with
them
as
with
everyone
else
still
he
thought
of
several
who
would
find
it
hard
to
resist
the
temptation
he
would
see
them
one
by
one
and
get
them
bidding
haggling
roger
frowned
disgustedly
no
help
for
it
though
and
it
was
a
relief
it
would
bring
a
truce
in
his
house
for
a
time
but
the
truce
was
brief
on
the
afternoon
when
he
sold
his
collection
roger
came
home
all
out
of
sorts
he
had
been
forced
to
haggle
long
it
had
been
a
mean
inglorious
day
one
of
the
brightest
paths
in
his
life
had
ended
in
a
pigstie
but
at
least
he
had
bought
some
peace
in
his
home
women
women
women
he
shut
the
front
door
with
a
slam
and
went
up
to
his
room
for
a
little
rest
a
little
of
what
he
had
paid
for
on
the
stairs
he
passed
young
betsy
and
he
startled
the
girl
by
the
sudden
glare
of
reproach
he
bestowed
upon
her
savagely
he
told
himself
he
was
no
feminist
that
night
the
brief
talk
he
had
with
edith
was
far
from
reassuring
with
no
deborah
there
to
wound
her
pride
edith
quickly
showed
herself
friendly
to
her
father
but
when
he
advised
her
to
keep
her
nurse
she
at
once
refused
to
consider
it
i
want
you
to
he
persisted
with
an
anxious
note
in
his
voice
he
had
tried
life
without
hannah
here
and
he
did
not
care
to
try
it
again
it
is
already
settled
father
i
sent
her
away
this
morning
then
you
get
her
right
back
he
exclaimed
but
edith
face
grew
obstinate
i
do
care
to
give
deborah
she
replied
another
chance
to
talk
as
she
did
roger
looked
at
her
gloomily
you
will
though
he
was
thinking
you
two
have
only
just
begun
let
any
little
point
arise
which
a
couple
of
men
would
settle
offhand
and
you
two
will
get
together
and
go
it
there
be
no
living
in
the
house
with
deepening
displeasure
he
watched
the
struggle
between
them
go
on
sometimes
it
seemed
to
roger
there
was
not
a
topic
he
could
bring
up
which
would
not
in
some
way
bring
on
a
clash
one
night
in
desperation
he
proposed
the
theatre
i
afraid
we
ca
afford
it
said
edith
glancing
at
deborah
and
she
had
the
same
answer
again
and
again
for
the
requests
her
children
made
if
they
involved
but
the
smallest
expense
no
dear
i
afraid
we
afford
that
she
would
say
gently
with
a
sigh
and
under
this
constant
pressure
these
nightly
little
thrusts
and
jabs
deborah
would
grow
rigid
with
annoyance
and
impatience
for
heaven
sake
edith
she
burst
out
one
night
when
the
children
had
gone
to
their
lessons
can
you
think
of
nothing
on
earth
except
your
own
little
family
here
it
comes
again
thought
roger
scowling
into
his
paper
he
heard
edith
curt
reply
no
i
ca
not
nowadays
nobody
seems
to
think
of
them
you
mean
that
i
do
do
you
yes
i
thinking
of
george
do
you
want
him
killed
in
the
trenches
in
a
war
with
germany
or
japan
are
you
utterly
mad
demanded
edith
no
i
awake
my
eyes
are
open
but
yours
are
shut
so
tight
my
dear
you
ca
see
what
has
happened
you
know
this
war
has
made
us
poor
and
your
own
life
harder
but
that
all
the
big
thing
it
has
done
you
know
nothing
about
suppose
you
teach
me
edith
said
with
a
prim
provoking
little
smile
deborah
turned
on
her
angrily
it
has
shown
that
all
such
mothers
as
you
are
out
of
date
and
have
got
to
change
that
we
bound
together
all
over
the
world
whether
we
like
it
or
whether
we
do
and
that
if
we
want
to
keep
out
of
war
we
got
to
do
it
by
coming
right
out
of
our
own
little
homes
thinking
edith
thinking
votes
for
women
edith
said
deborah
looked
at
her
rose
with
a
shrug
all
right
edith
i
give
up
thank
you
i
not
worth
it
you
better
go
back
to
your
office
now
and
go
on
with
your
work
of
saving
the
world
and
use
every
hour
of
your
time
and
every
dollar
you
possess
i
stay
here
and
look
after
my
children
deborah
had
gone
into
the
hall
roger
buried
deep
in
his
paper
heard
the
heavy
street
door
close
he
looked
up
with
a
feverish
sigh
and
saw
at
the
open
door
of
his
study
george
and
betsy
standing
curious
solemn
and
wide
eyed
how
long
had
they
been
listening
chapter
xxxv
there
came
a
season
of
sleet
and
rain
when
the
smaller
children
were
shut
indoors
and
it
was
hard
to
keep
them
amused
they
did
not
look
well
and
edith
was
worried
she
had
always
dreaded
the
spring
and
to
carry
her
family
safely
through
she
had
taken
them
in
former
years
to
atlantic
city
for
two
weeks
that
of
course
was
impossible
now
trouble
was
bound
to
come
she
thought
and
it
was
not
long
in
coming
bobby
who
was
ten
years
old
and
went
to
school
with
his
brother
george
caught
a
wretched
cold
one
day
edith
popped
him
into
bed
but
despite
her
many
precautions
he
gave
his
cold
to
bruce
and
tad
suppose
i
ask
allan
baird
to
come
deborah
suggested
he
wonderful
with
children
you
know
edith
curtly
accepted
his
services
she
felt
he
had
been
sent
for
to
prevent
her
getting
doctor
lake
but
she
said
nothing
she
would
wait
through
long
hard
days
and
longer
nights
she
slaved
upstairs
all
proffers
of
aid
she
declined
she
kept
elizabeth
home
from
school
to
help
her
with
the
many
meals
the
medicines
and
the
endless
task
of
keeping
her
lively
patients
in
bed
she
herself
played
with
them
by
the
hour
while
the
ache
in
her
head
was
a
torment
at
night
she
was
up
at
the
slightest
sound
heavy
circles
came
under
her
eyes
within
a
few
days
her
baby
bruce
had
developed
pneumonia
that
evening
after
dinner
while
deborah
was
sitting
with
roger
in
the
living
room
she
heard
her
sister
coming
downstairs
she
listened
acutely
and
glancing
around
she
saw
that
roger
was
listening
too
edith
passed
the
doorway
and
went
on
down
the
hall
where
they
heard
her
voice
at
the
telephone
she
came
back
and
looked
in
at
the
door
i
called
doctor
lake
she
said
i
just
taken
bruce
temperature
it
a
hundred
and
five
and
two
fifths
deborah
glanced
up
with
a
start
oh
edith
she
said
softly
her
sister
turned
and
looked
at
her
i
ought
to
have
had
him
before
she
said
when
he
comes
please
bring
him
right
up
to
the
room
and
she
hurried
upstairs
pshaw
breathed
roger
anxiously
he
had
seen
bruce
an
hour
ago
and
the
sight
of
the
tiny
boy
so
exhausted
and
so
still
had
given
him
a
sudden
scare
could
it
be
that
would
happen
roger
rose
and
walked
the
floor
edith
was
right
he
told
himself
they
should
have
had
lake
long
before
and
they
would
have
by
george
if
it
had
not
been
for
interference
he
glanced
at
her
indignantly
bringing
in
baird
to
save
money
eh
well
it
was
just
about
time
they
stopped
saving
money
on
their
own
flesh
and
blood
what
had
bruce
to
do
with
tenement
babies
but
he
had
had
tenement
treatment
just
that
deborah
had
had
her
way
at
last
with
edith
children
and
one
of
them
might
have
to
pay
with
its
life
again
roger
glared
at
his
silent
daughter
and
now
even
in
his
excited
state
he
noticed
how
still
and
rigid
she
was
how
unnatural
the
look
she
bent
on
the
book
held
tightly
in
her
hands
still
deborah
said
nothing
she
could
feel
her
father
anger
both
he
and
edith
held
her
to
blame
she
felt
herself
in
a
position
where
she
could
not
move
a
hand
she
was
stunned
and
could
not
think
clearly
a
vivid
picture
was
in
her
mind
vivid
as
a
burning
flame
which
left
everything
else
in
darkness
it
was
of
bruce
one
adorable
baby
fighting
for
breath
what
would
i
do
if
he
were
mine
when
the
doctor
arrived
she
took
him
upstairs
and
then
came
down
to
her
father
well
he
demanded
i
do
know
we
have
to
wait
and
they
both
sat
silent
at
last
they
heard
a
door
open
and
close
and
presently
steps
coming
down
the
stairs
roger
went
out
into
the
hall
come
right
in
here
doctor
wo
you
i
want
to
hear
about
this
myself
very
well
sir
and
lake
entered
the
room
with
edith
close
behind
him
he
took
no
notice
of
anyone
else
write
this
down
he
said
to
her
and
give
it
to
the
nurse
when
she
comes
a
heavy
man
of
middle
age
with
curious
dark
impassive
eyes
that
at
times
showed
an
ironic
light
lake
was
a
despot
in
a
world
of
mothers
to
whom
his
word
was
law
he
was
busy
with
no
time
to
waste
and
his
low
harsh
voice
now
rattled
out
orders
which
edith
wrote
down
in
feverish
haste
an
hourly
schedule
night
and
day
he
named
a
long
list
of
things
needed
at
once
night
nurse
will
be
here
in
an
hour
he
ended
day
nurse
eight
get
sleep
yourself
and
plenty
of
it
as
it
is
you
not
fit
to
take
care
of
a
cat
abruptly
he
turned
and
left
the
room
edith
followed
the
street
door
closed
and
in
a
moment
after
that
his
motor
was
off
with
a
muffled
roar
edith
came
back
picked
up
her
directions
and
turned
to
her
sister
will
you
go
up
and
sit
with
bruce
i
telephone
the
druggist
she
said
deborah
went
to
the
sick
room
bruce
small
face
peaked
and
gray
in
the
soft
dim
light
turned
as
she
entered
and
came
to
the
bed
well
dear
she
whispered
the
small
boy
eyes
large
and
heavy
with
fever
looked
straight
into
hers
sick
said
the
baby
hoarsely
the
next
instant
he
tossed
up
his
hands
and
went
through
a
spasm
trying
to
breathe
it
passed
he
relaxed
a
little
and
again
stared
solemnly
at
his
aunt
sick
he
repeated
wery
sick
deborah
sat
silent
the
child
had
another
fight
for
his
breath
and
this
time
as
he
did
so
deborah
body
contracted
too
a
few
moments
later
edith
came
in
deborah
returned
downstairs
and
for
over
an
hour
she
sat
by
herself
roger
was
in
his
study
betsy
and
george
had
gone
to
bed
the
night
nurse
arrived
and
was
taken
upstairs
still
deborah
mind
felt
numb
and
cold
instinctively
again
and
again
it
kept
groping
toward
one
point
if
i
had
a
baby
as
sick
as
that
what
would
i
do
what
would
i
do
when
the
doorbell
rang
again
she
frowned
rose
quickly
and
went
to
the
door
it
was
allan
allan
come
in
here
will
you
she
said
and
he
followed
her
into
the
living
room
what
is
it
he
inquired
bruce
is
worse
oh
i
sorry
why
did
edith
let
me
know
she
had
lake
said
deborah
he
knitted
his
brows
in
annoyance
then
smiled
well
i
do
mind
that
he
replied
i
rather
glad
she
feel
easier
now
what
did
he
tell
her
he
seemed
to
consider
it
serious
by
the
number
of
things
he
ordered
two
nurses
of
course
yes
day
and
night
deborah
was
silent
a
moment
i
may
be
wrong
she
continued
but
i
still
feel
sure
the
child
will
live
but
i
know
it
means
a
long
hard
fight
the
expense
of
it
all
will
be
heavy
well
whatever
it
is
i
meet
it
she
said
father
ca
he
has
reached
the
end
but
even
if
he
could
help
still
it
would
make
much
difference
in
what
i
been
deciding
because
when
i
was
with
bruce
i
saw
as
clear
as
i
see
you
now
that
if
i
had
a
child
like
that
as
sick
as
that
i
sacrifice
anything
everything
schools
tenement
children
thousands
i
use
the
money
which
should
have
been
theirs
and
the
time
and
the
attention
i
shut
them
all
out
they
could
starve
if
they
liked
i
be
like
edith
exactly
i
center
on
this
one
child
of
mine
deborah
turned
her
eyes
to
his
stern
and
gleaming
with
her
pain
and
she
continued
sharply
but
i
do
mean
to
shut
those
children
out
and
so
it
clear
as
day
to
me
that
i
ca
ever
marry
you
that
baby
was
the
finishing
stroke
she
made
a
quick
restless
movement
baird
leaned
slowly
forward
her
hands
in
her
lap
were
clenched
together
he
took
them
both
and
held
them
hard
no
this
is
clear
he
said
i
can
feel
it
in
your
hands
this
is
nerves
this
is
the
child
upstairs
this
is
edith
in
the
house
this
is
school
the
end
of
the
long
winter
strain
no
it
what
i
decided
but
this
is
the
wrong
decision
allan
answered
steadily
it
made
not
yet
it
is
not
we
wo
talk
of
it
now
you
in
no
condition
deborah
wide
sensitive
lips
began
to
quiver
suddenly
we
talk
of
it
now
or
never
at
all
i
want
it
settled
done
with
i
had
enough
it
killing
me
no
was
allan
firm
reply
in
a
few
days
things
will
change
child
will
be
out
of
danger
your
other
troubles
will
clear
away
but
what
of
next
winter
and
the
next
what
of
edith
children
ca
you
see
what
a
load
they
are
on
my
father
ca
you
see
he
ageing
fast
suppose
he
dies
baird
answered
it
will
leave
them
on
your
hands
you
have
children
wo
you
whether
you
marry
or
whether
you
do
and
so
will
i
i
their
guardian
that
wo
be
the
same
she
cried
as
having
children
of
our
own
look
into
my
eyes
i
looking
her
own
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
why
are
you
always
so
afraid
of
becoming
a
mother
allan
asked
in
his
gruff
low
voice
was
a
fierce
appeal
it
this
obsession
in
your
mind
that
you
be
a
mother
like
edith
and
that
absurd
you
never
will
you
say
you
afraid
of
not
keeping
school
the
first
thing
in
your
life
but
you
always
do
and
you
always
will
you
putting
it
ahead
of
me
now
yes
i
can
put
it
ahead
of
but
i
could
put
it
ahead
of
he
winced
at
this
and
she
noticed
it
because
you
are
strong
and
the
child
would
be
weak
the
child
would
be
like
bruce
are
you
sure
if
you
marry
you
must
have
a
child
yes
she
answered
huskily
if
i
married
you
i
want
a
child
and
that
want
in
me
would
grow
and
grow
until
it
made
both
of
us
wretched
i
that
kind
of
a
woman
that
why
my
work
has
succeeded
so
far
because
i
a
passion
for
children
they
not
my
work
they
my
very
life
she
bowed
her
head
her
mouth
set
hard
but
so
are
you
she
whispered
and
since
this
is
settled
allan
what
do
you
think
shall
we
try
to
go
on
working
together
side
by
side
seeing
each
other
every
day
as
we
have
been
doing
all
these
months
rather
hard
on
both
of
us
do
you
think
i
do
i
feel
that
way
she
said
again
her
features
quivered
the
kind
of
feeling
i
have
for
you
would
make
that
rather
difficult
his
grip
tightened
on
her
hands
i
wo
give
you
up
he
said
later
you
will
change
your
mind
he
left
the
room
and
went
out
of
the
house
deborah
sat
rigid
she
trembled
and
the
tears
came
she
brushed
them
angrily
away
struggling
to
control
herself
presently
she
grew
quieter
frowning
with
her
clear
gray
eyes
intently
staring
before
her
she
did
not
see
her
father
come
into
the
doorway
he
stopped
with
a
jerk
at
sight
of
her
face
what
the
matter
he
asked
she
started
nothing
the
matter
how
is
bruce
i
do
know
who
went
out
a
few
minutes
ago
allan
baird
she
answered
oh
you
explained
to
him
of
course
about
lake
yes
he
understands
she
said
he
wo
come
here
after
this
roger
looked
at
her
sharply
wondering
just
what
she
meant
he
hesitated
no
he
would
wait
he
said
and
went
upstairs
chapter
xxxvi
on
the
morrow
bruce
did
not
grow
better
if
anything
the
child
grew
worse
but
by
the
next
morning
the
crisis
had
passed
in
the
house
the
tension
relaxed
and
roger
suddenly
felt
so
weak
that
he
went
to
see
his
own
physician
they
had
a
long
and
serious
talk
later
he
went
to
his
office
but
he
gave
little
heed
to
his
work
sitting
there
at
his
desk
he
stared
through
the
window
far
out
over
the
city
a
plan
was
forming
in
his
mind
at
home
that
night
at
dinner
he
kept
watching
deborah
who
looked
tired
and
pale
and
rather
relaxed
and
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
house
he
telephoned
allan
to
come
at
once
it
something
which
ca
wait
he
urged
very
well
i
come
right
up
when
baird
arrived
a
little
later
roger
opened
the
door
himself
and
they
went
back
into
his
study
sit
down
he
said
smoke
allan
no
thanks
baird
looked
doubly
tall
and
lean
his
face
had
a
gaunt
appearance
and
as
he
sat
down
his
lithe
supple
right
hand
slowly
closed
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
now
then
began
roger
there
are
two
things
we
want
to
get
clear
on
the
first
is
about
yourself
and
deborah
there
has
been
trouble
has
there
yes
she
has
made
up
her
mind
not
to
marry
you
yes
i
guessed
as
much
and
roger
paused
do
you
mind
my
asking
questions
no
are
you
still
in
love
with
her
allan
i
am
and
she
with
you
i
think
so
then
it
the
same
old
trouble
yes
and
he
told
a
part
of
what
she
had
said
as
he
talked
in
clear
terse
even
tones
baird
steady
eyes
had
a
tortured
light
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
almost
reached
the
end
of
his
endurance
roger
smoked
in
silence
what
do
you
propose
to
do
wait
said
allan
a
few
days
more
then
try
again
if
i
fail
through
roger
shot
a
quick
look
at
him
i
do
think
you
fail
my
boy
and
what
more
i
think
i
can
help
you
this
is
a
large
house
allan
there
more
in
it
than
you
know
my
second
point
concerns
myself
i
going
to
die
within
a
year
as
baird
turned
on
him
suddenly
roger
grimly
smiled
and
said
we
wo
go
into
the
details
but
i
been
examined
lately
and
i
have
quite
positive
knowledge
of
what
i
suspected
for
some
time
so
far
i
have
told
no
one
but
you
and
i
telling
you
only
because
of
the
bearing
it
has
on
deborah
roger
leaned
forward
heavily
she
the
one
of
my
daughters
who
means
the
most
now
that
i
so
near
the
end
when
i
die
next
year
that
may
be
all
i
may
simply
end
a
blank
a
grave
i
am
not
sure
but
i
made
up
my
mind
above
everything
else
to
see
deborah
happy
before
i
go
and
i
mean
to
do
it
by
setting
her
free
so
free
i
think
it
will
frighten
her
roger
went
on
to
explain
his
plan
and
they
talked
together
for
some
time
another
week
had
soon
gone
by
bruce
still
recovered
rapidly
and
the
other
sick
children
were
up
and
about
deborah
in
the
meantime
had
barely
been
in
the
house
at
all
but
late
on
saturday
evening
roger
found
her
in
her
room
she
was
working
he
came
behind
her
what
is
it
dad
busy
eh
he
hesitated
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
with
a
little
affectionate
pressure
you
kept
so
busy
lately
he
said
i
had
time
to
see
anything
of
you
how
your
work
going
much
better
thanks
now
that
the
winter
is
over
he
questioned
her
about
her
schools
and
then
after
a
brief
pause
well
daughter
he
said
it
has
been
a
great
fight
and
i
proud
of
you
for
it
and
if
i
got
anything
to
say
his
hand
was
still
on
her
shoulder
and
he
felt
her
tighten
suddenly
it
is
by
way
of
criticism
please
be
sure
of
that
ahead
in
this
damnable
war
my
faith
in
men
has
been
badly
shaken
up
humanity
seems
to
me
still
a
child
a
child
who
needs
to
go
to
school
god
knows
we
need
men
and
women
like
you
and
i
proud
of
all
you
accomplished
i
be
the
last
man
to
hold
you
back
i
only
want
to
help
you
go
on
by
seeing
to
it
that
you
are
free
from
anything
which
can
hinder
you
he
stopped
again
for
a
moment
to
begin
with
he
said
i
understand
you
not
going
to
marry
allan
baird
she
stirred
slightly
did
he
tell
you
so
yes
i
asked
him
roger
replied
i
had
allan
here
a
few
nights
ago
and
he
told
me
you
had
decided
to
give
up
your
happiness
for
the
sake
of
all
those
children
in
that
big
family
of
yours
you
felt
you
must
keep
yourself
free
for
them
very
well
if
that
is
your
decision
i
propose
to
clear
the
way
she
looked
intently
up
at
his
face
you
not
free
now
he
continued
we
have
edith
and
her
children
here
and
i
growing
old
that
has
got
to
be
thought
of
i
do
want
to
leave
them
on
your
hands
so
as
soon
as
the
baby
is
well
enough
i
going
to
move
them
up
to
the
mountains
not
only
for
the
summer
they
are
to
stay
the
whole
year
from
this
time
on
they
to
make
it
their
home
father
but
they
ca
do
that
think
of
the
winters
deborah
cried
it
already
settled
he
answered
i
talked
to
edith
and
she
has
agreed
she
has
always
loved
the
farm
and
it
will
be
good
for
her
children
in
the
meantime
i
been
talking
to
george
i
told
him
going
to
talk
to
you
man
to
man
about
a
man
job
i
want
you
to
tackle
the
farm
but
dearie
he
only
a
boy
he
nearly
seventeen
said
roger
and
a
young
moose
for
his
age
and
old
dave
royce
will
still
be
there
it
the
work
george
has
been
dreaming
about
ever
since
he
was
a
child
you
should
have
seen
how
he
was
thrilled
by
the
scheme
i
told
him
we
spend
the
summer
together
up
there
laying
all
our
plans
investing
our
money
carefully
to
make
every
dollar
count
what
money
deborah
sharply
asked
but
her
father
was
talking
steadily
on
we
already
have
a
fine
lot
of
cattle
we
add
to
it
and
enlarge
the
barn
and
put
in
some
new
equipment
in
short
we
put
it
in
fine
shape
make
it
a
first
class
dairy
farm
then
george
i
said
to
him
going
to
turn
it
over
to
you
i
shall
give
the
farm
to
your
mother
and
the
rest
of
the
money
i
have
i
mean
to
invest
in
her
name
down
here
so
that
have
a
small
income
until
you
can
make
your
dairy
pay
what
money
are
you
speaking
of
deborah
voice
was
thick
and
hard
her
sensitive
lips
were
parted
and
she
was
breathing
quickly
i
sold
the
house
he
told
her
convulsively
she
gripped
his
arms
then
tell
me
where
mean
to
live
i
not
going
to
live
i
going
to
die
very
soon
i
have
definite
knowledge
without
speaking
deborah
rose
her
face
went
white
her
father
kept
tight
hold
of
her
hands
and
he
felt
them
trembling
growing
cold
you
soon
to
be
free
of
everyone
he
continued
painfully
i
know
this
is
hurting
you
but
i
see
so
plain
so
plain
my
child
just
what
it
is
i
got
to
do
i
trying
to
clear
the
way
for
you
to
make
a
simple
definite
choice
a
choice
which
is
going
to
settle
your
life
one
way
or
the
other
i
want
to
make
sure
you
see
what
you
doing
because
you
mean
so
much
to
me
we
flesh
and
blood
eh
my
daughter
and
in
this
family
of
ours
we
been
the
closest
ones
of
all
she
seemed
to
sway
a
little
not
going
to
she
whispered
so
it
hurts
you
to
lose
me
he
replied
it
will
be
hard
to
be
so
free
would
you
rather
not
have
had
me
at
all
i
been
quite
a
load
on
your
back
you
know
a
fearful
job
you
had
of
it
dragging
me
up
when
i
was
down
and
since
then
edith
and
bruce
and
the
rest
what
burdens
they
have
been
at
times
what
sharp
worries
heavy
sorrows
days
and
nights
you
and
i
have
gone
through
when
we
should
have
been
quietly
resting
free
to
keep
up
our
strength
for
our
next
day
work
suppose
you
had
missed
them
lived
alone
would
you
have
worked
better
you
do
know
but
you
will
know
soon
you
to
give
it
a
trial
for
i
cleared
the
way
so
that
if
you
throw
over
baird
to
be
free
you
shall
get
the
freedom
you
feel
you
need
father
please
is
this
fair
is
this
kind
she
asked
in
a
harsh
frightened
tone
her
eyes
were
wet
with
angry
tears
this
is
a
time
to
be
kind
my
dear
his
voice
was
quivering
like
her
own
i
bungling
it
i
bungling
it
but
you
must
let
me
stumble
along
and
try
to
show
you
what
i
mean
you
will
have
your
work
your
crowded
schools
to
which
you
be
able
to
give
your
life
but
i
look
ahead
i
who
know
you
and
i
do
see
you
happy
i
do
even
see
you
whole
for
you
there
will
be
no
family
none
of
the
intimate
sorrows
and
joys
that
have
been
in
this
house
will
come
to
you
i
look
back
and
i
see
them
all
for
a
man
who
has
come
so
near
the
end
gets
a
larger
vision
he
shut
his
eyes
his
jaw
set
tight
i
look
into
my
family
back
and
back
and
i
see
how
it
has
been
made
of
many
generations
certain
figures
stand
out
in
my
mind
they
cover
over
a
hundred
years
and
i
see
how
much
they
meant
to
me
i
see
that
i
been
one
of
them
a
link
in
a
long
chain
of
lives
all
and
reaching
on
in
my
life
they
have
all
been
here
as
i
shall
be
in
lives
to
come
and
this
is
what
i
want
for
you
he
held
her
close
a
moment
the
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
until
now
you
have
been
one
of
us
too
you
have
never
once
been
free
you
have
been
the
one
in
this
house
to
step
in
and
take
hold
and
try
to
decide
what
best
to
be
done
i
not
putting
you
up
on
a
pedestal
i
do
say
you
made
no
mistakes
but
i
say
you
the
kind
of
a
woman
who
craves
what
in
a
family
you
the
one
of
my
daughters
who
has
loved
this
house
the
most
yes
she
said
i
loved
this
house
but
now
for
you
all
this
will
stop
quite
suddenly
he
told
her
this
house
of
ours
will
soon
be
sold
and
within
a
few
months
i
shall
be
dead
and
your
family
will
have
dropped
out
of
your
life
stop
ca
you
stop
it
brutal
it
is
true
about
you
she
cried
i
wo
believe
it
her
voice
broke
go
and
see
my
physician
he
said
how
long
have
you
known
it
why
did
you
tell
me
because
we
had
troubles
enough
as
it
was
other
things
to
think
of
but
there
only
one
thing
now
this
freedom
you
are
facing
please
please
she
cried
imploringly
i
do
want
to
talk
of
myself
but
of
you
this
physician
no
he
answered
with
stern
pain
you
have
to
hear
me
out
my
child
we
talking
of
you
of
you
alone
when
i
am
gone
how
will
it
be
are
you
quite
sure
you
will
have
your
work
that
vision
of
yours
and
i
know
how
close
it
has
been
to
you
vivid
and
warm
almost
like
a
friend
but
so
was
my
business
once
like
that
when
i
was
as
young
as
you
and
the
business
grew
and
it
got
cold
impersonal
a
mere
machine
thank
god
i
had
a
family
is
your
work
growing
too
are
you
sure
it
wo
become
a
machine
and
wo
you
lose
touch
with
the
children
then
unless
you
have
a
child
of
your
own
friends
wo
be
enough
you
find
they
not
bound
up
into
yourself
the
world
may
reach
a
stage
at
last
where
we
shall
live
on
in
the
lives
of
all
we
may
all
be
one
big
family
but
that
time
is
still
far
off
we
hold
to
our
own
flesh
and
blood
and
so
i
sure
it
will
be
with
you
you
see
you
have
been
young
my
dear
and
your
spirit
has
been
fresh
and
new
but
how
are
you
going
to
keep
it
so
without
the
ties
always
had
he
felt
the
violent
clutch
of
her
hand
wo
she
whispered
but
he
went
on
relentlessly
and
what
will
you
do
without
allan
baird
for
you
see
you
have
not
even
worked
alone
you
have
had
this
man
who
has
loved
you
there
i
seen
how
much
he
has
helped
you
how
you
have
grown
and
he
has
grown
since
you
two
got
together
and
if
you
throw
him
over
now
it
seems
to
me
you
are
not
only
losing
what
has
done
the
most
for
your
work
but
you
running
away
from
life
as
well
you
never
won
by
doing
that
you
always
won
by
meeting
life
never
evading
it
taking
it
all
living
it
full
taking
chances
if
you
marry
baird
i
see
you
both
go
on
together
in
your
work
while
in
your
home
you
struggle
through
the
troubles
tangles
joys
and
griefs
which
most
of
us
mortals
know
so
well
i
see
you
in
a
world
of
children
but
with
children
too
of
your
own
to
keep
your
spirit
always
young
living
on
in
your
children
lives
roger
stopped
abruptly
he
groped
for
something
more
to
say
on
the
one
side
all
that
he
muttered
and
on
the
other
a
lonely
life
which
will
soon
grow
old
there
fell
a
dangerous
silence
and
sharply
without
warning
the
influence
deep
and
invisible
of
many
generations
of
stolid
folk
in
new
england
made
itself
felt
in
each
of
them
father
and
daughter
grew
awkward
both
the
talk
had
been
too
emotional
each
made
as
by
an
instinct
a
quick
strong
effort
at
and
felt
about
for
some
way
to
get
back
upon
their
old
easy
footing
roger
turned
to
his
daughter
her
head
was
still
bent
her
hands
clasped
tight
but
she
was
frowning
down
at
them
now
although
her
face
was
still
wet
with
tears
she
drew
a
deep
unsteady
breath
well
deborah
he
said
simply
here
i
gone
stumbling
on
like
a
fool
i
do
know
what
i
said
or
how
you
have
listened
i
listened
she
said
thickly
i
have
tried
he
went
on
in
a
steadier
tone
to
give
you
some
feeling
of
what
is
ahead
and
to
speak
for
your
mother
as
well
as
myself
and
more
than
that
much
more
than
that
for
the
world
has
changed
since
she
was
here
god
knows
i
tried
to
be
modern
a
humorous
glint
came
into
his
eyes
downright
modern
he
declared
have
i
asked
you
to
give
up
your
career
not
at
all
i
asked
you
to
marry
baird
and
go
right
on
with
him
in
your
work
and
if
you
ca
marry
allan
baird
after
what
he
has
done
for
you
how
in
god
name
can
you
modern
women
ever
marry
anyone
now
what
do
you
say
will
you
marry
him
do
laugh
at
me
i
serious
talk
but
deborah
was
laughing
although
her
father
felt
her
hands
still
cold
and
trembling
in
his
her
gray
eyes
bright
and
luminous
were
shining
up
into
his
own
what
a
time
you
been
having
have
you
dear
his
daughter
cried
unsteadily
fairly
lying
awake
at
night
and
racking
your
brains
for
everything
modern
i
ever
said
to
turn
it
and
twist
it
and
use
it
against
me
well
he
demanded
how
does
it
twist
it
twists
hard
thank
you
she
declared
you
turned
and
twisted
me
about
till
i
barely
see
how
i
can
live
at
all
you
can
though
marry
allan
baird
i
think
it
over
later
on
what
is
there
left
to
think
about
can
you
point
to
one
hole
in
all
said
yes
a
good
many
and
one
right
off
out
with
it
you
not
dying
deborah
told
him
calmly
i
feel
quite
certain
live
for
years
oh
you
do
eh
then
see
my
physician
i
will
i
see
him
how
long
did
you
give
yourself
just
a
few
months
no
he
said
it
might
be
more
admitted
roger
grudgingly
if
i
had
no
worries
to
wear
me
out
me
you
mean
exactly
well
you
worried
quite
enough
you
going
to
leave
it
to
me
to
decide
very
well
he
agreed
he
looked
at
her
you
have
listened
hard
he
gruffly
asked
yes
dear
her
hands
slowly
tightened
on
his
but
do
speak
of
this
again
you
to
leave
it
to
me
you
promise
yes
and
roger
left
her
he
went
to
bed
but
he
could
not
sleep
with
a
sudden
sag
in
his
spirits
he
felt
what
a
bungler
he
had
been
he
was
not
used
to
these
solemn
talks
he
told
himself
irately
what
a
fool
to
try
it
and
how
had
deborah
taken
it
all
he
did
not
mind
her
laughter
nor
that
lighter
tone
of
hers
it
was
only
her
way
of
ending
the
talk
an
easy
way
out
for
both
of
them
but
what
had
she
thought
underneath
had
his
points
gone
home
he
tried
to
remember
them
pshaw
he
had
been
too
excited
and
he
could
recall
scarcely
anything
he
had
not
meant
to
speak
of
baird
he
had
meant
to
leave
him
out
yes
how
he
must
have
bungled
it
doubtless
she
was
smiling
still
even
the
news
about
himself
she
had
not
taken
seriously
but
as
he
thought
about
that
news
roger
mood
completely
changed
the
talk
of
the
evening
grew
remote
his
family
no
longer
real
mere
little
figures
shadowy
receding
swiftly
far
away
much
quieter
now
he
lay
a
long
time
listening
to
the
life
of
the
house
the
occasional
sounds
from
the
various
rooms
from
the
nursery
adjoining
came
little
bruce
piping
laugh
and
roger
could
hear
the
nurse
moving
about
afterwards
for
a
long
time
he
could
hear
only
creaks
and
breathings
never
had
the
old
house
seemed
so
like
a
living
creature
for
nearly
forty
years
it
had
held
all
that
he
had
loved
and
known
all
he
had
been
sure
of
outside
of
it
was
the
strange
the
new
the
uncertain
the
vast
unknown
stretching
away
to
infinity
again
he
heard
bruce
gay
little
laugh
what
did
it
remind
him
of
he
puzzled
then
he
had
it
edith
had
been
a
baby
here
her
cradle
had
been
in
this
very
room
close
by
the
bed
and
how
she
had
laughed
what
gurgles
and
ripples
of
bursting
glee
the
first
child
in
his
family
chapter
xxxvii
on
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
deborah
made
an
appointment
with
her
father
physician
and
had
a
long
talk
with
him
at
his
house
upon
her
return
she
went
to
her
room
and
stayed
there
until
evening
but
when
she
came
down
to
supper
her
manner
was
as
usual
at
the
table
she
joined
in
the
talk
of
edith
and
the
children
already
deep
in
their
preparations
for
the
move
up
to
the
farm
george
could
hardly
wait
to
start
that
life
would
be
a
change
indeed
in
edith
plans
for
her
family
and
as
they
talked
about
it
now
the
tension
of
hostility
which
had
so
long
existed
between
the
two
sisters
passed
away
each
knew
the
clash
had
come
to
an
end
that
they
would
live
together
no
more
and
as
though
in
remorse
they
drew
close
deborah
with
her
suggestions
edith
in
her
friendly
way
of
taking
and
discussing
each
one
then
deborah
went
again
to
her
room
her
room
was
just
over
roger
and
waking
several
times
in
the
night
he
heard
his
daughter
walking
the
floor
the
next
day
she
was
up
early
and
off
to
her
school
before
he
came
down
it
was
a
fine
spring
morning
roger
had
had
a
good
night
sleep
and
as
he
walked
to
his
office
he
was
buoyed
up
by
a
feeling
both
of
hope
for
his
daughter
and
of
solid
satisfaction
in
himself
as
he
remembered
all
that
he
had
said
to
her
curiously
enough
he
could
recall
every
word
of
it
now
every
point
which
he
had
made
rose
up
before
him
vividly
how
clear
he
had
been
how
simple
and
true
and
yet
with
what
a
tremendous
effect
he
had
piled
the
points
one
on
the
other
by
george
he
thought
with
a
little
glow
for
a
fellow
who
never
been
in
a
pulpit
i
put
up
a
devilish
strong
appeal
and
he
added
sagely
let
it
work
on
the
girl
give
it
a
chance
she
come
out
of
this
all
right
this
idea
some
fellows
have
that
every
woman
is
born
a
fool
is
fair
it
is
true
just
let
a
line
of
argument
be
presented
to
her
strong
and
clear
straight
from
the
shoulder
by
some
man
and
again
with
a
tingle
of
pleasure
his
mind
recurred
to
his
sermon
his
pleasures
had
been
few
of
late
so
he
dwelt
on
this
little
glow
of
pride
and
made
the
most
of
it
while
it
was
here
at
the
office
as
he
entered
his
room
he
stopped
with
a
slight
shock
of
surprise
john
standing
on
his
crutches
in
front
of
a
large
table
had
been
going
through
the
morning
mail
sorting
out
the
routine
letters
roger
did
not
need
to
see
he
had
just
finished
and
was
staring
at
the
window
the
light
fell
full
on
his
sallow
face
and
showed
an
amazing
happiness
at
roger
step
he
started
well
johnny
how
goes
it
this
morning
fine
thank
you
was
the
prompt
reply
and
john
hobbled
briskly
over
to
his
typewriter
in
the
corner
roger
sat
down
at
his
desk
as
he
did
so
he
glanced
again
at
the
cripple
and
felt
a
little
pang
of
regret
what
will
become
of
him
he
asked
when
i
close
out
my
business
he
still
thought
of
him
as
a
mere
boy
for
looking
at
the
small
crooked
form
it
was
difficult
to
remember
that
john
was
twenty
years
of
age
the
lad
had
worked
like
a
trojan
of
late
even
roger
engrossed
as
he
had
been
in
family
anxieties
had
noticed
it
in
the
last
few
weeks
he
would
have
to
make
some
provision
for
john
deborah
would
see
to
it
roger
went
slowly
through
his
mail
one
letter
was
from
the
real
estate
firm
through
whom
he
was
to
sell
the
house
the
deal
had
not
been
closed
as
yet
there
were
certain
points
still
to
be
settled
so
roger
called
john
to
his
desk
and
dictated
a
reply
when
he
finished
there
was
a
brief
pause
that
all
said
roger
gruffly
so
you
sellin
the
house
john
ventured
yes
the
lad
limped
back
to
his
corner
and
went
to
work
at
his
machine
but
presently
he
came
over
again
and
stood
waiting
awkwardly
what
is
it
johnny
roger
inquired
without
looking
up
say
gale
the
boy
began
in
a
carefully
casual
tone
would
you
mind
talking
business
a
minute
or
two
no
fire
ahead
well
sir
you
had
your
own
troubles
lately
you
have
had
much
time
for
things
here
the
last
time
you
went
over
the
books
was
nearly
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
john
paused
and
his
look
was
portentous
well
asked
roger
what
about
it
business
been
picking
up
any
since
then
yes
sir
was
the
answer
we
did
lose
a
cent
last
week
we
made
money
fifteen
dollars
good
lord
johnny
we
getting
rich
but
that
nothing
john
continued
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
gale
i
have
been
working
lately
on
a
new
line
i
thought
of
and
now
it
got
agoing
so
fast
it
getting
clean
away
from
me
again
he
stopped
and
swallowed
hard
out
with
it
then
said
roger
i
got
it
from
the
war
said
john
the
papers
are
still
half
full
of
war
news
and
that
what
keeping
our
business
down
because
we
adopting
ourselves
to
the
new
war
conditions
so
i
figured
it
like
this
say
there
are
a
million
people
over
here
in
america
who
got
either
friends
or
relations
in
the
armies
over
there
say
that
all
of
want
to
get
news
not
just
this
stuff
about
battles
but
real
live
news
of
happened
to
bill
has
bill
still
got
his
legs
and
arms
can
he
hold
down
a
job
when
he
gets
home
news
which
counts
for
something
see
a
big
new
market
business
for
us
so
i
tried
to
see
what
i
could
do
john
excitedly
shifted
his
crutches
roger
was
watching
intently
go
on
johnny
sure
i
go
on
one
night
i
went
to
a
library
where
they
have
english
papers
i
went
over
their
files
for
about
a
month
i
took
one
canadian
regiment
see
and
traced
it
through
and
i
got
quite
a
story
then
i
used
some
of
the
money
i
saved
and
bought
a
whole
bunch
of
papers
i
piled
up
in
the
room
where
i
sleep
and
went
through
nights
i
hired
two
kids
to
help
me
well
gale
the
thing
worked
fine
in
less
than
a
week
i
had
any
amount
of
little
bunches
of
clippings
see
how
i
mean
each
bunch
was
the
story
of
one
regiment
for
a
month
so
i
knew
we
could
deliver
the
goods
well
this
was
about
ten
days
ago
and
then
i
went
after
the
market
i
went
to
a
man
i
met
last
year
in
an
advertising
office
and
for
fifty
dollars
we
put
an
in
the
sunday
times
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
the
next
day
nothing
doing
i
was
here
at
and
i
went
through
every
mail
not
a
single
answer
to
my
and
i
thought
i
was
busted
but
tuesday
morning
there
were
three
with
five
dollar
checks
inside
of
in
the
afternoon
there
were
two
more
and
the
next
day
eleven
by
the
end
of
last
week
we
had
friday
i
put
in
another
and
there
been
over
seventy
more
since
then
that
makes
a
hundred
and
twenty
in
all
six
hundred
dollars
and
i
swamped
i
ai
done
nothing
yet
i
just
kept
all
for
you
to
see
he
went
quickly
to
the
table
gathered
a
pile
of
letters
there
and
brought
them
over
to
roger
desk
roger
glanced
over
a
few
of
them
dazed
he
looked
around
into
john
shrewd
face
where
mingled
devotion
and
triumph
and
business
zeal
were
shining
johnny
he
said
huskily
you
adopted
my
business
and
no
mistake
john
swallowed
again
and
scowled
with
joy
let
figure
it
out
he
proposed
we
will
they
were
at
it
all
day
laying
their
plans
adopting
the
work
of
the
office
to
the
new
conditions
they
found
they
would
need
a
larger
force
including
a
french
and
a
german
translator
they
placed
other
ads
in
the
papers
they
forgot
to
have
lunch
and
worked
steadily
on
till
the
outer
rooms
were
empty
and
still
at
last
they
were
through
roger
wearily
put
on
his
cuffs
and
went
and
got
his
coat
and
hat
say
gale
john
asked
him
how
about
this
letter
the
one
you
dictated
this
morning
to
that
firm
about
your
house
roger
turned
and
looked
at
him
throw
it
into
the
basket
he
said
we
write
another
and
tell
we
have
changed
our
minds
he
paused
for
just
a
moment
and
then
he
added
brusquely
if
this
goes
through
as
i
hope
it
will
i
guess
better
come
into
the
firm
and
he
left
the
room
abruptly
behind
him
there
was
not
a
sound
at
home
in
his
study
that
evening
he
made
some
more
calculations
in
a
few
weeks
he
would
have
money
enough
to
start
edith
and
her
family
in
their
new
life
on
the
farm
for
the
present
at
least
the
house
was
safe
why
father
edith
came
into
the
room
i
did
know
you
had
come
home
what
kept
you
so
long
at
the
office
oh
business
my
dear
have
you
had
any
supper

and
i
like
some
he
replied
i
see
to
it
myself
she
said
edith
was
good
at
this
sort
of
thing
and
the
supper
she
brought
was
delicious
he
ate
it
with
keen
relish
then
he
went
back
to
his
study
and
picked
up
a
book
an
old
favorite
he
started
to
read
but
presently
dozed
the
book
dropped
from
his
hands
and
he
fell
asleep
he
awakened
with
a
start
and
saw
deborah
looking
down
at
him
for
a
moment
he
stared
up
as
he
came
to
his
senses
and
in
his
daughter
clear
gray
eyes
he
thought
he
saw
a
happiness
which
set
his
heart
to
beating
fast
well
he
questioned
huskily
we
to
be
married
right
away
he
stared
a
moment
longer
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
my
dear
i
was
afraid
you
he
stopped
short
deborah
bent
close
to
him
and
he
felt
her
squeeze
his
arm
i
been
over
and
over
all
you
said
she
told
him
in
a
low
sweet
voice
i
had
a
good
many
ups
and
downs
but
i
all
through
now
i
sure
you
were
right
and
she
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
oh
dad
dad
it
such
a
relief
and
i
so
happy
thank
you
dear
where
is
allan
he
asked
presently
i
get
him
she
said
she
left
the
room
and
in
a
moment
allan
tall
ungainly
form
appeared
in
the
doorway
well
allan
my
boy
roger
cried
oh
roger
gale
said
allan
softly
he
was
wringing
roger
hand
so
she
decided
to
risk
you
eh
roger
said
unsteadily
well
baird
you
look
like
a
devilish
risk
for
a
woman
like
her
who
has
the
whole
world
on
her
back
as
it
is
i
know
i
know
and
how
rash
she
has
been
only
two
years
and
her
mind
was
made
up
but
that
like
her

when

roger
blithely
he
told
them
the
story
of
john

scheme

if
things

out
in
the
office
as
i
hope

mortgage

the
house
and
then
make
it
your
wedding
gift
from
the
new
firm
to
the
new
family
deborah
choked
a
little
allan
what
do
you
think
of
us
now
i
think
he
answered
in
a
drawl
that
we
better
try
to
persuade
the
new
firm
to
live
with
the
new
family
we
will
and
the
sooner
the
better
she
said
i
going
up
to
the
mountains
said
roger
yes
but
you
coming
back
in
the
fall
and
when
you
do
you
coming
here
and
you
going
to
live
here
years
and
years
you
forgetting
my
doctor
not
at
all
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
sunday
and
i
know
just
what
saying
you
do
look
it
my
dear
said
roger
but
of
course
you
may
be
right
if
you
take
the
proper
care
of
me
here
and
john
keeps
booming
things
for
the
firm
and
george
makes
a
huge
success
of
the
farm
deborah
added
quickly
and
deborah
of
teaching
the
world
oh
allan
hush
up
look
here
he
said
you
go
upstairs
and
tell
edith
all
this
your
father
and
i
want
to
be
alone
and
when
the
two
men
were
left
alone
they
smoked
and
said
nothing
they
smiled
at
each
other
it
hard
to
decide
grunted
roger
at
last
which
did
it
my
wonderful
sermon
or
your
own
long
waiting
game
i
inclined
to
think
it
was
the
game
for
any
other
man
but
you
with
all
you
done
without
any
talk
no
sir
there
would
have
been
a
chance
for
she
modern
baird
she
modern
and
i
going
to
live
just
as
long
as
i
can
i
want
to
see
what
happens
here
the
next
night
in
his
study
how
quiet
it
was
edith
was
busy
packing
upstairs
deborah
and
allan
were
gone
thoughts
drifted
slowly
across
his
mind
well
she
was
married
the
last
of
his
daughters
the
one
whom
he
cared
most
for
the
one
who
had
taken
the
heaviest
risks
and
this
was
the
greatest
risk
of
all
for
although
she
had
put
it
happily
out
of
her
thoughts
for
the
moment
roger
knew
the
old
troublesome
question
was
still
there
in
deborah
mind
the
tenement
children
or
her
own
the
big
family
or
the
small
he
felt
there
would
still
be
struggles
ahead
and
with
a
kind
of
a
wistfulness
he
tried
to
see
into
the
future
here
he
gave
a
sudden
start
in
his
chair
by
george
he
thought
they
forgot
the
ring
scowling
he
tried
to
remember
yes
in
the
brief
simple
service
that
day
in
which
so
much
had
been
omitted
music
flowers
wedding
gown
even
the
ring
had
been
left
out
why
not
from
any
principle
he
knew
that
they
were
not
such
fools
no
they
had
simply
forgotten
it
in
the
haste
of
getting
married
at
once
well
by
thunder
for
a
girl
whose
father
had
been
a
collector
of
rings
for
the
best
part
of
his
natural
life
it
was
pretty
shabby
to
say
the
least
then
he
recollected
that
he
too
had
forgotten
it
and
this
quieted
him
immediately
i
get
one
though
he
promised
himself
and
no
plain
wedding
ring
either
i
make
baird
attend
to
that
no
i
get
her
a
ring
worth
while
he
sank
deep
in
his
chair
and
took
peace
to
his
soul
by
thinking
of
the
ring
he
would
choose
and
this
carried
his
thoughts
back
over
the
years
for
there
had
been
so
many
rings
chapter
xxxviii
it
was
a
clear
beautiful
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
may
and
as
the
train
puffing
up
the
grade
wound
along
the
connecticut
river
roger
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
the
orchards
were
pink
and
white
on
the
hills
slowly
the
day
wore
away
the
river
narrowed
the
hills
reared
high
and
in
the
sloping
meadows
gray
ribs
and
shoulders
of
granite
appeared
the
air
had
a
tang
of
the
mountains
everywhere
were
signs
of
spring
of
new
vigor
and
fresh
life
but
the
voices
at
each
station
sounded
drowsier
than
at
the
last
the
eyes
appeared
more
stolid
and
to
roger
it
felt
like
a
journey
far
back
into
old
ways
of
living
old
beliefs
and
old
ideals
he
had
always
had
this
feeling
and
always
he
had
relished
it
this
dive
into
his
boyhood
but
it
was
different
for
this
was
more
than
a
journey
it
was
a
migration
too
close
about
him
in
the
car
were
edith
and
her
children
bound
for
a
new
home
up
there
in
the
very
heart
and
stronghold
of
all
old
things
in
america
old
things
dear
to
edith
heart
as
she
sat
by
the
window
staring
out
he
watched
her
shapely
little
head
he
noted
the
hardening
lines
on
her
forehead
and
the
gray
which
had
come
in
her
hair
it
had
been
no
easy
move
for
her
this
she
shown
pluck
to
take
it
so
quietly
he
saw
her
smile
a
little
then
frown
and
go
on
with
her
thinking
what
was
she
thinking
about
he
wondered
all
she
had
left
behind
in
new
york
or
the
rest
of
her
life
which
lay
ahead
she
had
always
longed
for
things
simple
and
old
well
she
would
have
them
now
with
a
vengeance
summer
and
winter
the
year
in
the
battered
frame
house
on
the
mountain
side
the
birthplace
of
her
family
a
recollection
came
to
him
of
a
summer
dusk
two
years
ago
and
a
woman
with
a
lawn
mower
cutting
the
grass
on
the
family
graves
would
edith
ever
be
like
that
a
mere
custodian
of
the
past
if
she
did
he
thought
she
would
be
false
to
the
very
traditions
she
tried
to
preserve
for
her
forefathers
had
never
been
mere
guardians
of
things
gone
by
always
they
had
been
pioneers
that
house
had
not
been
old
to
them
but
a
thrilling
new
adventure
their
old
homes
they
had
left
behind
far
down
in
the
valleys
to
the
east
and
even
those
valley
homes
had
been
new
to
the
rugged
men
come
over
the
sea
would
edith
ever
understand
would
she
see
that
for
herself
the
new
must
emerge
from
her
children
from
the
ideas
desires
and
plans
already
teeming
in
their
minds
would
she
show
keen
interest
sympathy
would
she
be
able
to
keep
her
hold
in
the
seat
behind
her
mother
betsy
was
sitting
with
bruce
in
her
lap
looking
over
a
picture
book
quietly
roger
watched
the
girl
what
are
you
going
to
be
he
asked
a
woman
college
president
a
surgeon
or
a
senator
and
what
will
your
mother
think
of
you
then
they
changed
cars
and
on
a
train
made
up
of
antiquated
coaches
they
wound
through
a
side
valley
down
which
rushing
and
tumbling
came
the
river
that
bore
roger
name
he
went
into
the
smoking
car
and
presently
george
joined
him
there
george
did
not
yet
smoke
with
his
elders
but
he
had
bought
a
package
of
gum
and
he
was
chewing
absorbedly
plainly
the
lad
was
excited
over
the
great
existence
which
he
saw
opening
close
ahead
roger
glanced
at
the
boy
broad
shoulders
noticed
the
eager
lines
of
his
jaw
looked
down
at
his
enormous
hands
unformed
as
yet
ungainly
but
in
them
was
a
hungriness
that
caused
a
glow
in
roger
breast
one
more
of
the
family
starting
out
it
all
going
to
depend
on
you
roger
gravely
counseled
your
whole
life
will
depend
on
the
start
you
make
either
you
going
to
settle
down
like
so
many
of
your
neighbors
up
there
or
you
going
to
hustle
plan
out
your
day
keep
on
with
your
studies
and
go
to
college
the
state
agricultural
college
i
mean
in
short
keep
up
to
date
my
boy
and
become
in
time
a
big
figure
in
farming
i
going
to
do
it
george
replied
his
grandfather
glanced
again
at
his
face
so
scowling
so
determined
and
a
gleam
of
compassion
and
yearning
came
for
a
moment
in
roger
eyes
his
heavy
hand
lay
on
george
knee
that
right
son
he
grunted
make
the
family
proud
of
you
i
do
all
i
can
to
help
you
start
my
business
is
picking
up
thank
god
and
i
be
able
to
back
you
now
i
stay
up
here
a
good
part
of
the
summer
both
of
us
got
a
lot
to
learn
and
not
only
from
books
we
want
to
remember
we
plenty
to
learn
from
the
neighbors
too
take
old
dave
royce
for
instance
who
when
all
is
said
and
done
has
worked
our
farm
for
twenty
odd
years
and
never
once
run
me
into
debt
but
gee
demurred
george
he
so
out
of
date
i
know
he
is
son
but
we
got
to
go
slow
and
roger
look
passed
furtively
along
the
faces
in
the
car
we
do
want
to
forget
he
warned
that
this
is
still
new
england
every
new
idea
we
have
we
want
to
go
easy
with
snake
it
in
i
got
an
awful
lot
of
the
boy
muttered
hungrily
at
the
farm
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
roger
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
george
voice
it
was
just
beneath
his
window
but
cattle
are
only
part
of
it
dave
the
boy
declared
in
earnest
tones
just
part
of
what
we
can
have
up
here
think
what
we
got
over
three
hundred
acres
and
we
want
to
make
every
acre
count
we
want
to
get
in
a
whole
lot
more
of
hogs
belted
hampshires
if
we
can
afford
and
a
couple
of
hundred
hens
white
leghorns
ought
to
fill
the
bill
of
course
that
just
a
starter
i
got
a
scheme
for
some
incubators
electric
run
by
the
dynamo
which
we
put
in
down
by
the
dam
and
we
can
do
wonders
with
bees
too
dave
i
got
a
book
on
i
like
you
to
read
and
besides
there
big
money
in
squab
these
days
rich
women
in
new
york
hotels
eat
thousands
of
every
night
and
ducks
of
course
and
turkeys
i
like
a
white
gobbler
right
at
the
start
if
we
knew
where
we
could
get
one
cheap
the
voice
broke
off
and
there
was
a
pause
we
can
do
an
awful
lot
with
this
place
then
dave
deep
drawl
that
so
george
yes
i
guess
that
so
only
we
do
want
to
fool
ourselves
that
ai
noah
ark
over
thar
it
a
barn
and
just
for
a
starter
if
i
was
you
here
dave
deliberated
of
course
it
none
of
my
business
he
said
it
for
you
and
your
grandfather
to
decide
and
i
do
propose
to
interfere
in
what
ai
any
of
my
affair
yes
yes
dave
sure
that
all
right
but
go
on
just
for
a
starter
cows
came
the
tranquil
answer
i
been
hunting
around
since
you
wrut
me
last
month
and
i
know
of
three
good
milkers
three
why
dave
i
wrote
we
want
thirty
or
forty
yes
you
wrut
dave
answered
but
i
druv
all
around
these
parts
and
there
ai
but
three
that
i
can
find
and
i
ai
so
sure
of
that
third
one
she
looks
like
she
might
george
cut
in
but
you
only
had
a
buggy
dave
gee
i
going
to
have
a
ford
that
so
george
you
bet
it
so
and
we
go
on
a
cow
hunt
all
over
the
state
well
i
dunno
but
what
you
right
dave
responded
cautiously
you
might
get
more
cows
if
you
had
a
ford
an
got
so
you
could
run
it
yes
i
guess
it
a
pretty
good
scheme
i
believe
in
being
conservative
george
but
i
dunno
now
but
what
a
ford
their
voices
passed
from
under
the
window
and
roger
relaxed
and
smiled
to
himself
it
was
a
good
beginning
he
thought
they
bought
a
ford
soon
afterwards
and
in
the
next
few
weeks
of
june
they
searched
the
farms
for
miles
around
slowly
adding
to
their
herd
to
roger
surprise
he
found
many
signs
of
a
new
life
stirring
there
the
farmers
buying
autos
and
improved
machinery
thinking
of
new
processes
and
down
in
the
lower
valleys
they
found
several
big
stock
farms
which
were
decidedly
modern
affairs
at
one
such
place
the
man
in
charge
took
a
fancy
to
george
and
asked
him
to
drop
over
often
you
bet
i
drop
over
often
george
replied
as
he
climbed
excitedly
into
his
ford
i
want
to
see
more
of
those
milking
machines
we
going
to
have
some
day
ourselves
a
dynamo
too
and
at
home
down
by
the
ruined
mill
he
again
set
about
rebuilding
the
dam
roger
felt
himself
growing
stronger
his
sleeps
were
sound
and
his
appetite
had
come
back
to
a
surprising
degree
the
mountain
air
had
got
into
his
blood
and
george
warm
vigor
into
his
soul
one
afternoon
watching
the
herd
come
home
some
thirty
huge
animals
swinging
along
with
a
slow
heavy
power
in
their
limbs
he
breathed
the
strong
sweet
scent
of
them
on
the
mountain
breeze
george
came
running
by
them
and
stopped
a
moment
by
roger
side
watching
closely
and
eagerly
every
animal
as
it
passed
and
roger
glanced
at
george
face
the
herd
passed
on
and
george
followed
behind
his
collie
dog
leaping
and
barking
beside
him
and
roger
looked
up
at
a
billowy
cloud
resting
on
a
mountain
top
and
wondered
whether
after
all
that
new
york
doctor
had
been
right
he
followed
the
herd
into
the
barn
in
two
long
rows
the
great
heads
of
the
cattle
turned
hungrily
lowing
and
sniffing
deep
breathing
harshly
stamping
as
the
fodder
cart
came
down
the
lines
what
a
splendidly
wholesome
work
for
a
lad
growing
up
with
his
roots
in
the
soil
in
these
massive
simple
forces
of
life
what
of
edith
other
children
would
they
be
willing
to
stay
here
long
each
morning
roger
breakfasted
with
bruce
the
baby
by
his
side
what
a
thing
for
you
little
lad
he
thought
if
you
could
live
here
all
your
days
but
will
you
will
you
want
to
stay
you
too
get
the
fever
as
i
did
for
the
city
in
the
joyous
shining
mysterious
eyes
of
the
baby
he
found
no
reply
he
had
many
long
talks
with
betsy
who
was
eager
to
go
away
to
school
and
with
bob
and
little
tad
who
were
going
to
school
in
the
village
that
fall
and
the
feeling
came
to
roger
that
surely
he
would
see
these
lives
at
least
for
many
years
ahead
they
were
so
familiar
and
so
real
so
fresh
and
filled
with
hopes
and
dreams
and
he
felt
himself
so
a
part
of
them
all
but
one
morning
climbing
the
steep
upper
field
to
a
spring
george
wanted
to
show
him
roger
suddenly
swayed
turned
faint
he
caught
hold
of
a
boulder
on
the
wall
and
held
himself
rigid
breathing
hard
it
passed
and
he
looked
at
his
grandson
but
george
had
noticed
nothing
the
boy
had
turned
and
his
brown
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
fallow
field
below
wistfully
roger
watched
his
face
they
both
stood
motionless
for
a
long
time
as
the
summer
drew
slowly
to
a
close
roger
spent
many
quiet
hours
alone
by
the
copse
of
birches
where
the
glory
of
autumn
was
already
stealing
in
and
out
among
the
tall
slender
stems
of
the
trees
and
he
thought
of
the
silent
winter
there
and
of
the
spring
which
would
come
again
and
the
long
fragrant
summer
and
he
watched
the
glow
on
the
mountains
above
and
the
rolling
splendors
of
the
clouds
at
dusk
he
heard
the
voices
of
animals
birds
and
insects
murmuring
up
from
all
the
broad
valley
then
gradually
sinking
to
deep
repose
many
never
to
wake
again
and
the
span
of
his
life
from
the
boyhood
which
he
could
recall
so
vividly
here
among
these
children
seemed
brief
to
him
as
a
summer
day
only
a
part
of
a
mighty
whole
made
up
of
the
innumerable
lives
the
many
generations
of
his
family
his
own
flesh
and
blood
come
out
of
a
past
he
could
never
know
and
going
on
without
him
now
branching
dividing
widening
out
to
what
his
eyes
would
never
see
vaguely
he
pictured
them
groping
their
way
just
as
he
himself
had
done
it
seemed
to
roger
that
all
his
days
he
had
been
only
entering
life
as
some
rich
bewildering
thicket
like
this
copse
of
birches
here
never
getting
very
deep
never
seeing
very
clearly
never
understanding
all
and
so
it
had
been
with
his
children
and
so
it
was
with
these
children
of
edith
and
so
it
would
be
with
those
many
others
always
groping
blundering
starting
children
only
children
all
and
yet
what
lives
they
were
to
lead
what
joys
and
revelations
and
disasters
would
be
theirs
in
the
strange
remote
world
they
would
live
in
my
flesh
and
blood
that
i
never
shall
know
but
the
stars
were
quiet
and
serene
the
meadows
and
the
forests
on
the
broad
sweep
of
the
mountain
side
took
on
still
brighter
warmer
hues
and
there
was
no
gloom
in
these
long
on
a
frosty
night
in
september
he
left
the
farm
to
go
to
the
city
from
his
seat
in
the
small
automobile
roger
looked
back
at
the
pleasant
old
house
with
its
brightly
lighted
windows
and
then
he
turned
to
george
by
his
side
we
in
good
shape
for
the
winter
son
but
george
did
not
get
his
full
meaning
at
the
little
station
there
were
no
other
passengers
they
walked
the
platform
for
some
time
then
the
train
with
a
scream
came
around
the
curve
a
quick
grip
on
george
hand
and
roger
climbed
into
the
car
inside
a
moment
later
he
looked
out
through
the
window
by
a
trainman
with
a
lantern
george
stood
watching
smiling
up
and
he
waved
his
hand
as
the
train
pulled
out
chapter
xxxix
the
next
morning
on
his
arrival
in
town
roger
went
to
his
office
he
had
little
cause
for
uneasiness
there
for
twice
in
the
summer
he
had
come
down
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
business
while
john
had
taken
brief
vacations
at
a
seaside
place
nearby
the
boy
had
no
color
now
in
his
cheeks
as
always
they
were
a
sallow
gray
with
the
skin
drawn
tight
over
high
cheek
bones
his
vigor
was
all
in
his
eyes
but
here
was
a
new
john
nevertheless
a
successful
man
of
affairs
he
had
on
a
spruce
new
suit
of
brown
no
cheap
affair
but
one
carefully
fitted
to
conceal
and
soften
his
deformity
he
was
wearing
a
bright
blue
tie
and
a
cornflower
in
his
buttonhole
and
his
sandy
hair
was
sleekly
brushed
he
showed
roger
into
his
private
room
a
small
place
he
had
partitioned
off
where
over
his
desk
was
a
motto
in
gold
this
is
no
place
for
your
troubles
or
mine
lord
but
you
got
yourself
fixed
up
fine
in
here
said
roger
john
smiled
broadly
and
you
looking
like
a
new
man
johnny
i
had
a
great
time
at
the
seashore
learned
to
sail
a
boat
alone
what
do
you
think
of
this
chair
of
mine
and
john
complacently
displayed
the
ingenious
contrivance
in
front
of
his
desk
somewhat
like
a
bicycle
seat
it
was
made
of
steel
and
leather
pads
wonderful
said
roger
where
you
ever
pick
it
up
i
had
it
made
was
the
grave
reply
when
a
fellow
has
got
up
in
life
enough
to
have
a
stenographer
it
high
time
he
was
sitting
down
let
see
you
do
it
john
sat
down
now
how
is
business
roger
asked
great
since
the
little
slump
we
had
in
august
it
has
taken
a
new
start
and
not
only
war
business
at
that
the
old
people
are
sending
in
orders
again
i
tell
you
what
it
is
gale
this
country
is
right
on
the
edge
of
a
boom
and
the
junior
member
of
the
firm
tilted
triumphantly
back
in
his
chair
with
the
solid
comfort
which
comes
to
a
man
when
he
returns
to
find
his
affairs
all
going
well
roger
worked
on
until
five
and
then
he
started
for
his
home
deborah
had
not
yet
come
in
and
a
deep
silence
reigned
in
the
house
he
looked
through
the
rooms
downstairs
and
with
content
he
noticed
how
little
had
been
altered
his
beloved
study
had
not
been
touched
on
the
third
floor
in
the
large
back
room
he
found
john
comfortably
installed
there
were
gay
prints
upon
the
walls
fresh
curtains
at
the
windows
a
mandolin
lying
on
a
chair
and
roger
glancing
down
at
the
keen
glad
face
of
his
partner
told
himself
that
the
doctor
who
had
said
this
lad
would
die
was
a
fool
these
doctors
fool
themselves
often
he
thought
deborah
and
allan
had
the
front
room
on
the
floor
below
roger
went
in
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
about
him
how
restful
and
how
radiant
was
this
large
chamber
so
softly
lighted
waiting
through
a
passageway
lined
with
cupboards
he
went
into
his
room
at
the
back
deborah
had
repapered
it
but
with
a
pattern
so
similar
that
roger
did
not
notice
the
change
he
only
felt
a
vague
freshness
here
as
though
even
this
old
chamber
too
were
making
a
new
start
in
life
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
to
live
here
for
years
slowly
he
unpacked
his
trunk
and
took
a
bath
and
dressed
at
his
leisure
then
he
heard
deborah
voice
at
the
door
come
in
come
in
he
answered
why
father
dearie
deborah
cried
oh
how
well
you
looking
dad
and
she
kissed
him
happily
oh
but
i
glad
to
have
you
back
that
good
he
said
and
he
squeezed
her
hand
here
come
to
the
light
let
me
look
at
you
he
saw
her
cheeks
a
little
flushed
the
gladness
in
her
steady
eyes
happy
everything
just
right
his
daughter
nodded
smiling
and
he
gave
a
whimsical
frown
no
ups
and
down
at
all
bad
oh
yes
plenty
but
all
so
small
good
fellow
to
live
with
very
and
your
work
it
going
splendidly
i
tell
you
about
it
this
evening
after
you
give
me
the
news
from
the
farm
they
chatted
on
for
a
short
while
but
he
saw
she
was
barely
listening
ca
you
guess
what
it
means
she
asked
him
softly
to
a
woman
of
my
age
after
she
has
been
so
afraid
she
was
too
old
that
she
married
too
late
to
know
at
last
to
be
sure
at
last
that
she
to
have
a
baby
dad
he
drew
back
a
little
and
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
by
george
he
huskily
exclaimed
oh
my
dear
my
dear
and
he
held
her
close
in
his
arms
for
some
time
till
both
of
them
grew
sensible
soon
after
she
had
gone
to
her
room
he
heard
allan
coming
upstairs
he
heard
her
low
sweet
cry
of
welcome
a
silence
then
their
voices
he
heard
them
laughing
together
and
later
deborah
humming
a
song
and
still
thinking
of
what
she
had
told
him
he
felt
himself
so
close
to
it
all
and
again
the
feeling
came
to
him
that
surely
he
would
live
here
for
years
allan
came
in
and
they
had
a
talk
deborah
says
she
has
told
you
the
news
yes
everything
all
right
i
suppose
her
condition
i
mean
said
roger
could
be
better
just
as
i
thought
those
six
weeks
we
had
up
in
maine
yes
you
both
show
it
working
hard
yes
and
deborah
roger
asked
you
have
to
help
me
hold
her
in
they
talked
a
few
moments
longer
and
went
down
to
the
living
room
john
was
there
with
deborah
all
four
went
in
to
dinner
and
through
the
conversation
from
time
to
time
roger
noticed
the
looks
that
went
back
and
forth
between
husband
and
wife
and
again
he
caught
deborah
smiling
as
though
oblivious
of
them
all
after
dinner
she
went
with
him
into
his
den
well
do
you
like
the
house
she
inquired
better
than
ever
he
replied
i
wonder
if
you
mind
it
there
be
people
coming
to
dinner
you
know
that
wo
bother
me
any
he
said
and
committee
meetings
now
and
then
but
you
safe
in
here

a
good
thick
door
let
talk
he
retorted
as
hard
as
they
please
you
married
now
they
ca
scare
me
a
bit
only
at
ten
by
george
you
got
to
knock
off
and
go
to
bed
oh
i
take
care
of
myself
she
said
if
you
do
allan
will
we
had
a
talk
scheming
already
yes
when
will
it
be
in
april
i
think
you

work
in
your
schools
a
month
before
and
in
the
meantime
not
too
hard
no
and
not
too
easy
i
so
sure
now
that
i
can
do
both
and
deborah
kissed
him
gently
i
so
happy
dearie
and
oh
so
very
glad
here
there
followed
for
roger
after
that
many
quiet
evenings
at
home
untroubled
days
in
his
office
seldom
did
he
notice
the
progress
of
his
ailment
his
attention
was
upon
his
house
as
this
woman
who
mothered
thousands
of
children
worked
on
for
her
great
family
putting
all
in
order
making
ready
for
the
crisis
ahead
when
she
would
become
the
mother
of
one
now
even
more
than
ever
before
her
work
came
crowding
into
his
home
the
house
was
old
but
the
house
was
new
for
from
schools
and
libraries
cafés
and
tenements
and
streets
the
mighty
formless
hunger
which
had
once
so
thrilled
her
father
poured
into
the
house
itself
and
soon
became
a
part
of
it
he
felt
the
presence
of
the
school
he
heard
the
daily
gossip
of
that
bewildering
system
of
which
his
daughter
was
a
part
a
world
in
itself
with
its
politics
its
many
jarring
factions
its
jealousies
dissensions
its
varied
personalities
ambitions
and
conspiracies
but
in
spite
of
these
confusions
its
more
progressive
elements
downing
all
distrusts
and
fears
and
drawing
steadily
closer
to
life
fearlessly
rousing
everywhere
the
hunger
in
people
to
live
and
learn
and
to
take
from
this
amazing
world
all
the
riches
that
it
holds
the
school
with
its
great
challenge
steadily
increasing
its
demands
in
the
name
of
its
children
demands
which
went
deep
down
into
conditions
in
the
tenements
and
ramified
through
politics
to
the
city
hall
to
albany
and
even
away
to
washington
while
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
from
cities
towns
and
villages
came
the
vast
prophetic
story
of
the
free
public
schools
of
the
land
and
meanwhile
in
the
tenements
still
groping
and
testing
feeling
her
way
keeping
close
watch
on
her
great
brood
their
wakening
desires
their
widening
curiosities
deborah
was
bringing
them
children
mothers
and
fathers
too
together
through
the
one
big
hope
of
brighter
and
more
ample
lives
for
everybody
children
step
by
step
this
hope
was
spread
out
into
the
surrounding
swamps
and
jungles
of
blind
driven
lives
to
find
surprising
treasures
there
deep
buried
under
dirt
and
din
locked
in
the
common
heart
of
mankind
old
songs
and
fables
hopes
and
dreams
and
visions
of
immortal
light
handed
down
from
father
to
son
nurtured
guarded
breathed
upon
and
clothed
anew
by
countless
generations
innumerable
millions
of
simple
men
and
women
blindly
struggling
toward
the
sun
over
the
door
of
one
of
the
schools
were
these
words
carved
in
the
stone
humanity
is
still
a
child
our
parents
are
all
people
who
have
lived
upon
the
earth
our
children
all
who
are
to
come
and
the
dawn
at
last
is
breaking
the
great
day
has
just
begun
this
spirit
of
triumphal
life
poured
deep
into
roger
house
it
was
as
though
his
daughter
in
these
last
months
which
she
had
left
for
undivided
service
were
strengthening
her
faith
in
it
all
and
pledging
her
devotion
as
communing
with
herself
she
felt
the
crisis
drawing
near
chapter
xl
there
came
an
interruption
one
night
when
deborah
was
out
and
roger
sat
in
his
study
alone
the
maid
came
in
highly
flustered
and
said
gale
it
miss
laura
to
see
you
he
turned
with
a
startled
jerk
of
his
head
and
his
face
slowly
reddened
but
when
he
saw
the
maid
eager
expression
and
saw
that
she
was
expecting
a
scene
with
a
frown
of
displeasure
he
rose
from
his
chair
very
well
he
said
and
he
went
to
his
daughter
he
found
her
in
the
living
room
no
repentant
magdalene
but
quite
unabashed
and
at
her
ease
she
came
to
her
father
quickly
oh
dad
i
so
glad
to
see
you
dear
and
she
gave
him
a
swift
impetuous
kiss
her
rich
lips
for
an
instant
pressing
warmly
to
his
cheek
laura
he
said
thickly
come
into
my
study
will
you
i
alone
this
evening
i
so
glad
you
are
she
replied
she
followed
him
in
and
he
closed
the
door
he
glanced
at
her
confusedly
in
her
warmth
her
elegance
an
indefinable
change
in
the
tone
and
accent
of
her
high
magnetic
voice
and
in
her
ardent
smiling
eyes
she
seemed
to
him
more
the
foreigner
now
and
roger
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
what
had
happened
had
she
married
again
is
edith
here
still
she
was
asking
no
she
up
in
the
mountains
she
living
there
he
answered
edith
in
the
mountains
demanded
laura
in
surprise
and
she
asked
innumerable
questions
he
replied
to
each
one
of
them
carefully
slowly
meanwhile
getting
control
of
himself
and
deborah
married
married
at
last
how
has
it
worked
is
she
happy
dad
very
he
said
and
is
she
still
keeping
up
her
schools

the
present

have
to
stop
soon
laura
leaned
forward
curious
tell
me
dad
a
baby
yes
she
stared
a
moment
deborah
she
softly
exclaimed
and
in
a
moment
i
wonder
what
do
you
mean
her
father
asked
but
laura
evaded
his
question
she
plied
him
with
her
inquiries
for
a
few
minutes
longer
then
turned
to
him
with
a
challenging
smile
well
father
do
you
think
you
had
better
ask
me
now
about
myself
he
looked
away
a
moment
but
turned
resolutely
back
i
suppose
so
when
did
you
land
this
morning
dear
from
italy
with
my
husband
she
replied
and
roger
started
slightly
i
want
you
to
meet
him
soon
she
said
very
well
he
answered
at
his
disturbed
almost
guilty
expression
laura
laughed
a
little
and
rose
and
came
over
and
hugged
him
tight
oh
but
father
dearest

working
out
so
splendidly
i
want
you
to
know
him
and
see
for
yourself

york
for
a
while
he

more
to
do
here

wholesale

her
father
growled
but
laura
smiled

all
ashamed
of
yourselves
scrambling
so
to
get
rich
quick
out
of
this
war

bit

her
father
retorted

the
moment

her
cheerful
answer
and

roger
said
why

send
a
few
of
your
troops
to
help
those
plucky
frenchmen
because
she
replied
we

a
feeling
that
this
is
a
war
where
we
had
much
better
help
ourselves
high
ideals
he
snorted
rome

she
remarked
unabashed
and
her
father
scowled
at
her
whimsically

heathen

you
up
he
declared
laura
had
risen
smiling
oh
no
do
give
me
up
she
said
for
you
see
she
added
softly
a
heathen
with
a
great
deal
of
love
in
her
heart
for
thee
my
dearest
dad
may
i
bring
him
down
my
husband
yes
i
telephone
to
deborah
and
arrange
it
when
she
had
gone
he
returned
to
his
chair
and
sat
for
a
long
time
in
a
daze
he
was
still
disturbed
and
bewildered
what
a
daughter
of
his
and
what
did
it
mean
could
she
really
go
on
being
happy
like
this
sinning
yes
she
was
sinning
laura
had
broken
her
marriage
vows
she
had
run
off
with
another
fellah
those
were
the
plain
ugly
facts
and
now
divorced
and
she
was
careering
gayly
on
and
her
views
of
the
war
were
plain
heathenish
and
yet
there
was
something
about
her
yes
he
thought
he
loved
her
still
what
for
for
being
so
happy
and
yet
she
was
wrong
to
be
happy
all
wrong
his
thoughts
went
in
circles
and
his
confusion
and
dismay
grew
even
deeper
the
next
night
when
laura
brought
her
new
husband
to
dine
for
in
place
of
the
dark
polished
scoundrel
whom
roger
had
expected
here
was
a
spruce
and
affable
youth
with
thick
light
hair
and
ruddy
cheeks
a
brisk
pleasant
manner
of
talking
and
a
decidedly
forcible
way
of
putting
the
case
of
his
country
at
war
they
kept
the
conversation
to
that
for
despite
deborah
friendly
air
she
showed
plainly
that
she
wanted
to
keep
the
talk
impersonal
and
laura
rather
amused
at
this
replied
by
treating
deborah
and
allan
and
her
father
too
with
a
bantering
forbearance
for
their
narrow
views
and
deborah
religion
of
brotherhood
democracy
all
that
to
laura
was
passé
from
time
to
time
roger
glanced
at
her
face
into
her
clear
and
luminous
eyes
so
warm
with
the
joy
of
living
with
this
new
man
her
second
how
his
family
had
split
apart
he
wrote
edith
the
news
of
her
sister
and
he
received
but
a
brief
reply
nor
did
deborah
speak
of
it
often
she
seemed
to
want
to
forget
laura
life
as
the
crisis
in
her
own
drew
near
chapter
xli
deborah
had
not
yet
stopped
work
again
and
again
she
put
it
off
for
in
her
busy
office
so
many
demands
both
old
and
new
kept
pressing
in
upon
her
such
unexpected
questions
and
vexing
little
problems
kept
cropping
up
as
deborah
tried
to
arrange
her
work
for
the
colleague
who
was
to
take
her
place
in
the
spring
that
day
after
day
she
lingered
there
until
one
afternoon
in
march
her
husband
went
to
her
office
gave
her
an
hour
to
finish
up
and
then
brought
her
home
with
him
she
had
a
fit
of
the
blues
that
night
allan
was
called
out
on
a
case
and
a
little
while
later
roger
found
his
daughter
alone
in
the
living
room
a
book
unopened
in
her
lap
her
gray
eyes
glistening
with
tears
she
smiled
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
it
so
silly
she
muttered
unsteadily
just
my
condition
i
suppose
i
feel
as
though
i
had
done
with
school
for
the
remainder
of
my
days
better
leave
me
now
dearie
she
added
i
not
very
proud
of
myself
but
i
be
all
right
in
the
morning
the
next
day
she
was
herself
again
and
went
quietly
on
with
her
preparations
for
the
coming
of
her
child
but
still
the
ceaseless
interests
of
those
hordes
of
other
children
followed
her
into
the
house
not
only
her
successor
but
principals
and
teachers
came
for
counsel
or
assistance
and
later
when
reluctantly
she
refused
to
see
such
visitors
still
the
telephone
kept
ringing
and
letters
poured
in
by
every
mail
for
in
her
larger
family
there
were
weddings
births
and
deaths
and
the
endless
savage
struggle
for
life
and
there
were
many
climaxes
of
dreams
and
aspirations
of
loves
and
bitter
jealousies
and
out
of
all
this
straining
and
this
fever
of
humanity
came
messages
to
deborah
last
appeals
for
aid
and
advice
and
gifts
for
the
child
who
was
to
be
born
tiny
garments
quaintly
made
by
women
and
girls
from
italy
from
russia
and
from
poland
baby
blankets
wraps
and
toys
and
curious
charms
and
amulets
there
were
so
many
of
these
gifts
there
enough
for
forty
babies
deborah
told
her
father
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
to
avoid
hurting
anyone
feelings
and
is
it
rather
awful
the
way
these
inequalities
will
crop
up
in
spite
of
you
i
know
of
eight
tenement
babies
born
down
there
in
this
one
week
how
much
fuss
and
feathers
is
made
over
them
and
their
coming
into
the
world
poor
mites
roger
smiled
at
his
daughter
you
remind
me
of
jekyll
and
hyde
he
said
father
what
a
horrible
thought
what
have
jekyll
and
hyde
to
do
with
me
nothing
my
dear
he
answered
only
it
queer
and
a
little
uncanny
something
i
never
seen
before
this
double
mother
life
of
yours
it
was
only
a
few
days
later
when
coming
home
one
evening
he
found
that
deborah
doctor
had
put
her
to
bed
and
installed
a
nurse
there
followed
a
week
of
keen
suspense
when
roger
stayed
home
from
the
office
she
liked
to
have
him
with
her
and
sitting
at
her
bedside
he
saw
how
changed
his
daughter
was
how
far
in
these
few
hours
she
had
drawn
into
herself
he
had
suspected
for
some
time
that
all
was
not
well
with
deborah
and
allan
confirmed
his
suspicions
there
was
to
be
grave
danger
both
for
the
mother
and
the
child
it
would
come
out
all
right
of
course
he
strove
to
reassure
himself
nothing
else
could
happen
now
with
her
life
so
splendidly
settled
at
last
that
fate
could
be
so
pitiless
no
it
was
unthinkable
this
is
what
comes
of
your
modern
woman
roger
exclaimed
to
allan
one
night
this
is
the
price
she
paying
for
those
years
of
work
the
crisis
came
toward
the
end
of
the
week
and
while
for
one
entire
night
and
through
the
day
that
followed
and
far
into
the
next
night
the
doctors
and
nurses
fought
for
life
in
the
room
upstairs
roger
waited
left
to
himself
sitting
in
his
study
or
restlessly
moving
through
the
house
and
still
that
thought
was
with
him
the
price
it
was
kept
in
his
mind
by
the
anxious
demands
which
her
big
family
made
for
news
the
telephone
kept
ringing
women
in
motors
from
uptown
and
humbler
visitors
young
and
old
kept
coming
to
make
inquiries
more
gifts
were
brought
and
flowers
and
roger
saw
these
people
and
as
he
answered
their
questions
he
fairly
scowled
in
their
faces
unconsciously
for
his
mind
was
not
clear
reporters
came
barely
an
hour
passed
without
bringing
a
man
or
a
woman
from
some
one
of
the
papers
he
gave
them
only
brief
replies
why
they
leave
his
house
alone
he
saw
her
name
in
headlines
deborah
gale
at
point
of
death
and
he
turned
angrily
away
vividly
on
the
second
night
there
came
to
him
a
picture
of
deborah
birth
so
long
ago
in
this
same
house
how
safe
it
had
been
how
different
how
secluded
and
shut
in
no
world
had
clamored
for
news
and
so
vivid
did
this
picture
grow
that
when
at
last
there
came
to
his
ears
the
shrill
clear
cry
of
a
new
life
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
be
sure
whether
this
were
not
still
his
dream
of
that
other
night
so
long
ago
but
now
a
nurse
had
led
him
upstairs
and
he
stood
by
a
cradle
looking
down
at
a
small
wrinkled
face
almost
wholly
concealed
by
a
soft
woolly
blanket
and
presently
allan
behind
him
said
it
a
boy
and
he
to
be
named
after
you
roger
looked
up
how
the
mother
he
asked
almost
out
of
danger
was
the
reply
then
roger
glanced
at
allan
face
and
saw
how
drawn
and
gray
it
was
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
back
to
the
child
allan
had
gone
and
so
had
the
nurse
and
he
was
alone
by
the
cradle
relief
and
peace
and
happiness
stole
into
his
spirit
he
felt
the
deep
remoteness
of
this
strange
new
little
creature
from
all
the
clamoring
world
without
which
he
himself
was
soon
to
leave
the
thought
grew
clearer
clearer
as
with
a
curious
steady
smile
roger
stood
there
looking
down
well
little
brother
you
here
thank
god
and
nobody
knows
how
close
we
be
for
a
little
while
he
thought
for
we
almost
out
of
the
world
you
and
i
days
passed
deborah
strength
increased
and
soon
they
let
roger
come
into
the
room
she
too
was
remote
from
the
world
for
a
time
that
great
family
outside
was
anxious
no
longer
it
left
her
alone
but
soon
it
would
demand
her
never
again
he
told
himself
would
she
be
so
close
so
intimate
as
here
in
her
bed
with
this
child
of
hers
to
whom
she
had
given
her
father
name
these
hours
are
my
real
two
long
quiet
weeks
of
this
happiness
and
then
in
a
twinkling
it
was
gone
the
child
fell
sick
within
a
few
hours
its
small
existence
hung
by
a
thread
and
to
roger
startled
eyes
a
new
deborah
was
revealed
tense
and
silent
on
her
bed
her
sensitive
lips
compressed
with
pain
her
birthmark
showing
a
jagged
line
of
fiery
red
upon
her
brow
as
her
ears
kept
straining
to
catch
every
sound
from
the
nursery
adjoining
through
hours
of
stern
anguish
she
became
the
kind
of
mother
that
she
had
once
so
dreaded
shutting
out
everything
else
in
the
world
people
schools
all
other
children
rich
or
poor
well
sick
or
dying
here
was
the
crisis
of
deborah
life
one
night
as
she
lay
listening
with
her
hand
gripping
roger
tight
frowning
abruptly
she
said
to
him
in
a
harsh
unnatural
voice
they
do
care
any
longer
none
of
them
care
safe
and
stopped
worrying
for
they
know
they
soon
have
me
back
at
work
the
work
she
added
fiercely
that
made
my
body
what
it
is
not
fit
to
bear
a
baby
she
threw
a
quick
and
tortured
look
toward
the
door
of
the
other
room
my
work
for
those
others
all
those
years
will
be
to
blame
if
this
one
dies
and
if
it
does
live
i
through
i
wo
go
on
i
could
i
be
too
bitter
after
this
toward
all
of
them
these
last
two
words
were
whispers
so
bitter
they
made
roger
cold
but
this
child
is
going
to
live
he
responded
hoarsely
its
mother
stared
up
with
a
quivering
frown
the
next
moment
her
limbs
contracted
as
from
an
electric
shock
there
had
come
a
faint
wail
from
the
other
room
and
this
went
on
for
three
days
and
nights
again
roger
lived
as
in
a
dream
he
saw
haggard
faces
from
time
to
time
of
doctors
nurses
servants
he
saw
allan
now
and
then
his
tall
ungainly
figure
stooped
his
features
gaunt
his
strong
wide
jaw
set
like
a
vise
but
his
eyes
kind
and
steady
still
his
low
voice
reassuring
and
roger
noticed
john
at
times
hobbling
quickly
down
a
hall
and
stopping
on
his
crutches
before
a
closed
door
listening
then
these
figures
would
recede
and
it
was
as
though
he
were
alone
in
the
dark
at
last
the
nightmare
ended
one
afternoon
as
he
sat
in
his
study
allan
came
in
slowly
and
dropped
exhausted
into
a
chair
he
turned
to
roger
with
a
smile
safe
now
i
think
he
said
quietly
roger
went
to
deborah
and
found
her
asleep
her
face
at
peace
he
went
to
his
room
and
fell
himself
into
a
long
dreamless
slumber
in
the
days
which
followed
again
he
sat
at
her
bedside
and
together
they
watched
the
child
in
her
arms
so
feeble
still
the
small
creature
appeared
that
they
both
spoke
in
whispers
but
as
little
by
little
its
strength
returned
deborah
too
became
herself
and
though
still
jealously
watchful
of
its
every
movement
she
had
time
for
other
thinking
she
had
talks
with
her
husband
not
only
about
their
baby
but
about
his
work
and
hers
slowly
her
old
interest
in
all
they
had
had
in
common
returned
and
to
the
messages
from
outside
she
gave
again
a
kindlier
ear
allan
tells
me
she
said
one
day
when
she
was
alone
with
her
father
that
i
can
have
no
more
children
and
i
glad
of
that
but
at
least
i
have
one
she
added
and
he
has
already
made
me
feel
like
a
different
woman
than
before
i
feel
sometimes
as
though
i
come
a
million
miles
along
in
life
and
yet
again
it
feels
so
close
all
that
i
left
back
there
in
school
because
i
so
much
closer
now
to
every
mother
and
every
child
at
last
i
one
of
the
family
chapter
xlii
of
that
greater
family
one
member
had
been
in
the
house
all
through
the
month
which
had
just
gone
by
but
he
had
been
so
quiet
so
carefully
unobtrusive
that
he
had
been
scarcely
noticed
very
early
each
morning
day
after
day
john
had
gone
outside
for
his
breakfast
and
thence
to
the
office
where
he
himself
had
handled
the
business
as
well
as
he
could
only
coming
to
roger
at
night
now
and
then
with
some
matter
he
could
not
settle
alone
but
always
stoutly
declaring
that
he
needed
no
other
assistance
do
come
gale
he
had
urged
you
look
worn
out
you
be
sick
yourself
if
you
ai
careful
and
anyhow
if
you
hang
around
you
be
here
whenever
she
wants
you
early
in
deborah
illness
john
had
offered
to
give
up
his
room
for
the
use
of
one
of
the
nurses
that
mighty
thoughtful
of
you
johnny
allan
had
responded
but
got
plenty
of
room
as
it
is
just
you
stick
around
we
want
you
here
all
right
doc
if
there
any
little
thing
you
know
answering
the
at
night
or
anything
else
that
i
can
do
thank
you
so
i
let
you
know
but
in
the
meantime
go
to
bed
from
that
day
on
john
had
taken
not
only
his
breakfast
but
his
supper
too
outside
and
no
one
had
noticed
his
absence
coming
in
late
he
had
hobbled
silently
up
to
his
room
stopping
to
listen
at
deborah
door
he
had
kept
so
completely
out
of
the
way
it
was
not
till
the
baby
was
three
weeks
old
and
past
its
second
crisis
that
deborah
thought
to
ask
for
john
when
he
came
to
her
bed
she
smiled
up
at
him
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
i
thought
we
see
him
together
she
said
john
stood
on
his
crutches
staring
down
and
as
deborah
watched
him
all
at
once
her
look
grew
intent
johnny
she
said
softly
go
over
there
will
you
and
turn
up
the
light
so
we
can
see
him
better
and
when
this
was
done
though
she
still
talked
smilingly
of
the
child
again
and
again
she
glanced
up
at
john
face
at
the
strange
expression
stern
and
sad
and
wistful
there
when
he
had
gone
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
and
deborah
sent
for
her
husband
the
next
day
at
the
office
john
came
into
roger
room
roger
had
been
at
work
several
days
and
they
had
already
cleared
up
their
affairs
here
something
said
john
gruffly
that
i
wish
you
put
away
somewhere
and
he
handed
to
his
partner
a
small
blue
leather
album
filled
with
the
newspaper
clippings
dealing
with
deborah
illness
on
the
front
page
was
one
with
her
picture
and
a
long
record
of
her
service
to
the
children
of
new
york
she
would
want
to
see
it
now
john
continued
awkwardly
but
i
thought
maybe
later
on
the
boy
would
like
to
have
it
what
do
you
think
he
inquired
roger
gave
him
a
kindly
glance
i
think
he
will
it
a
fine
thing
to
keep
and
he
handed
it
back
but
i
guess
you
better
put
it
away
and
give
it
to
her
later
yourself
john
shifted
his
weight
on
his
crutches
so
quickly
that
roger
looked
up
in
alarm
look
here
you
not
well
he
saw
now
that
the
face
of
the
cripple
was
white
and
the
sweat
was
glistening
on
his
brow
john
gave
a
harsh
little
nervous
laugh
oh
it
nothing
much
partner
he
replied
that
another
thing
i
wanted
to
tell
you
i
had
some
queer
pains
lately
new
ones
he
caught
his
breath
why
did
you
tell
me
you
young
fool
you
had
your
own
troubles
did
you
john
spoke
with
difficulty
but
i
be
all
right
i
guess
all
i
need
is
a
few
days
off
roger
had
pressed
a
button
and
his
stenographer
came
in
call
a
taxi
he
said
sharply
and
john
you
go
right
over
there
and
lie
down
i
going
to
take
you
home
at
once
i
got
a
better
scheme
said
john
setting
his
determined
jaws
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
his
cheeks
it
may
be
a
week
but
there
just
a
chance
it
may
be
a
little
worse
than
that
so
i
got
a
room
in
a
hospital
see
be
better
all
round
he
swayed
forward
johnny
roger
caught
him
just
in
time
and
the
boy
lay
senseless
in
his
arms
at
home
a
few
hours
later
allan
came
with
another
physician
down
from
john
small
bedroom
he
saw
his
colleague
to
the
door
and
then
came
in
to
roger
i
afraid
johnny
has
come
to
the
end
for
a
moment
roger
stared
at
him
has
eh
he
answered
huskily
you
absolutely
sure
he
has
nothing
nothing
on
earth
we
can
do
nothing
more
than
we
doing
now
he
has
fooled
you
fellows
before
you
know
not
this
time
how
long
will
it
be
days
or
hours
i
do
know
he
must
suffer
i
see
to
that
roger
rose
and
walked
the
floor
it
was
the
last
month
did
it
of
course
yes
i
blame
myself
for
that
i
would
said
allan
gently
you
done
a
good
deal
for
johnny
geer
he
has
done
a
good
deal
for
this
family
can
deborah
see
him
i
wish
she
could
better
stretch
a
point
for
her
had
you
she
been
a
kind
of
a
mother
to
john
i
know
but
she
ca
leave
her
bed
then
you
wo
tell
her
i
think
she
knows
she
talked
to
me
about
him
last
night
that
it
a
mother
roger
cried
she
was
watching
we
were
blind
he
came
back
to
his
chair
and
dropped
into
it
does
john
know
this
himself
he
asked
he
suspects
it
i
think
said
allan
then
go
and
tell
him
will
you
that
he
going
to
get
well
and
after
you
done
it
i
see
him
myself
i
got
something
in
mind
i
want
to
think
out
after
allan
had
left
the
room
roger
sat
thinking
about
john
he
thought
of
john
birth
and
his
drunken
mother
the
accident
and
his
struggle
for
life
through
babyhood
and
childhood
through
ignorance
and
filth
and
pain
through
din
and
clamor
and
hunger
fear
of
the
long
fierce
fight
which
john
had
made
not
to
be
put
away
in
some
big
institution
of
his
battle
to
keep
up
his
head
to
be
somebody
make
a
career
for
himself
he
thought
of
john
becoming
one
of
deborah
big
family
only
one
of
thousands
but
it
seemed
now
to
roger
that
john
had
stood
out
from
them
all
as
the
figure
best
embodying
that
great
fierce
hunger
for
a
full
life
and
as
the
link
connecting
the
one
who
slowly
year
by
year
had
emerged
from
her
greater
family
and
come
into
her
small
one
and
last
of
all
he
thought
of
john
as
his
own
companion
his
only
one
in
the
immense
adventure
on
which
he
was
so
soon
to
embark
a
few
moments
later
he
stood
by
john
bed
pretty
hard
johnny
he
gently
asked
oh
not
so
bad
as
it
might
be
i
guess
you
soon
feel
better
they
tell
me
boy
john
shut
his
eyes
yes
he
muttered
can
you
stand
my
talking
just
a
minute
sure
i
can
john
whispered
i
not
suffering
any
now
he
given
me
something
to
put
me
to
sleep
what
is
it
you
want
to
talk
about
business
not
exactly
partner
it
about
the
family
you
got
so
you
almost
one
of
us
i
guess
you
know
us
pretty
well
i
guess
i
do
it
meant
a
lot
to
me
gale
but
i
tell
you
what
you
do
know
john
roger
went
on
slowly
i
had
a
son
in
the
family
once
and
he
died
when
he
was
three
months
old
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
i
never
had
another
you
see
to
take
his
place
till
you
came
along
there
fell
a
breathless
silence
and
been
thinking
lately
roger
added
steadily
i
have
long
to
live
you
know
and
i
been
wondering
whether
you
like
to
come
into
the
family
take
my
name
do
you
understand
john
said
nothing
his
eyes
were
still
closed
but
presently
groping
over
the
bed
he
found
roger
hand
and
clutched
it
tight
after
this
from
time
to
time
his
throat
contracted
sharply
tears
welled
from
under
his
eyelids
then
gradually
as
the
merciful
drug
which
allan
had
given
did
its
work
his
clutch
relaxed
and
he
began
breathing
deep
and
hard
but
still
for
some
time
longer
roger
sat
quietly
by
his
side
the
next
night
he
was
there
again
death
had
come
to
the
huddled
form
on
the
bed
but
there
had
been
no
relaxing
with
the
head
thrown
rigidly
far
back
and
all
the
features
tense
and
hard
it
was
a
fighting
figure
still
a
figure
of
stern
protest
against
the
world
injustice
but
roger
was
not
thinking
of
this
but
of
the
discovery
he
had
made
that
in
their
talk
of
the
night
before
john
had
understood
him
completely
for
upon
a
piece
of
paper
which
allan
had
given
the
lad
that
day
these
words
had
been
painfully
inscribed
this
is
my
last
will
and
testament
i
am
in
my
right
mind
i
know
what
i
am
doing
though
nobody
else
does
nobody
is
here
to
my
partner
roger
gale
i
leave
my
share
in
our
business
and
to
my
teacher
deborah
baird
i
leave
my
crutches
for
her
school
chapter
xliii
after
john
had
gone
away
the
house
was
very
quiet
only
from
the
room
upstairs
there
could
be
heard
occasionally
the
faint
clear
cry
of
child
and
once
again
to
roger
came
a
season
of
repose
he
was
far
from
unhappy
his
disease
although
progressing
fast
gave
him
barely
any
pain
it
rather
made
its
presence
felt
by
the
manner
in
which
it
affected
his
mind
his
inner
life
grew
uneven
at
times
his
thoughts
were
as
in
a
fog
again
they
were
amazingly
clear
and
vistas
opened
far
ahead
he
could
not
control
his
thinking
this
bothered
him
at
the
office
in
the
work
he
still
had
to
do
for
some
months
he
had
been
considering
an
offer
from
one
of
his
rivals
a
modern
concern
which
wished
to
buy
out
his
business
together
with
that
of
three
other
firms
and
consolidate
them
all
into
one
corporation
and
roger
was
selling
and
it
was
hard
for
the
whole
idea
of
bargaining
was
more
distasteful
than
ever
now
he
had
to
keep
reminding
himself
of
edith
and
her
children
at
last
it
was
over
his
books
were
closed
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done
nor
did
he
care
to
linger
these
rooms
had
meant
but
little
to
him
they
had
been
but
a
place
of
transition
from
the
old
office
far
downtown
so
full
of
memories
of
his
youth
to
the
big
corporation
looming
ahead
the
huge
impersonal
clipping
mill
into
which
his
business
was
to
merge
and
it
came
to
his
mind
that
new
york
was
like
that
no
settled
calm
abiding
place
cherishing
its
memories
but
only
a
town
of
transition
a
great
turbulent
city
of
change
restlessly
shaking
off
its
past
tearing
down
and
building
anew
building
higher
higher
higher
rearing
to
the
very
stars
and
shouting
can
you
see
me
now
what
was
the
goal
of
this
mad
career
what
dazzling
city
would
be
here
for
a
time
he
stared
out
of
his
window
as
into
a
promised
land
slowly
at
last
he
rose
from
his
desk
clippings
clippings
clippings
he
looked
at
those
long
rows
of
girls
gleaning
in
items
large
and
small
the
public
reputations
of
all
kinds
of
men
and
women
new
kinds
in
a
new
nation
seething
with
activities
sweeping
on
like
some
wide
river
swollen
at
flood
season
to
a
new
america
a
world
which
roger
would
not
know
and
yet
it
would
be
his
world
still
for
in
it
he
would
play
a
part
in
their
lives
too
we
shall
be
there
the
dim
strong
figures
of
the
past
from
his
desk
he
gathered
a
few
belongings
then
he
looked
into
small
room
with
the
big
gold
motto
over
the
desk
this
is
no
place
for
your
troubles
or
mine
on
the
desk
lay
that
small
album
john
parting
gift
to
deborah
boy
roger
picked
it
up
and
walked
out
of
the
office
he
had
never
liked
in
the
elevator
he
noticed
that
his
shoes
needed
shining
and
when
he
reached
the
street
below
he
stopped
at
the
stand
on
the
corner
the
stocky
greek
with
bushy
black
hair
who
had
run
the
stand
for
many
years
gave
him
a
cheery
greeting
for
roger
had
stopped
there
frequently
not
that
he
cared
about
his
shoes
but
he
had
always
liked
to
watch
the
crowds
of
people
passing
no
hurry
boss
none
said
roger
then
i
give
a
fine
shine
polish
too
yes
polish
too
and
roger
settled
back
to
watch
and
put
in
new
shoe
strings
he
added
with
a
whimsical
smile
men
and
women
girls
and
boys
by
thousands
passed
him
pushing
hurrying
shuffling
by
girls
tittering
and
nudging
and
darting
quick
side
glances
bobbing
heads
and
figures
vigorous
steps
and
dancing
eyes
life
bubbling
over
everywhere
in
laughter
in
sharp
angry
tones
in
glad
expectant
chatter
deborah
big
family
across
the
street
was
a
movie
between
two
lurid
posters
and
there
was
a
dance
hall
overhead
the
windows
were
all
open
and
faintly
above
the
roar
of
the
street
he
could
hear
the
piano
drum
fiddle
and
horn
the
thoroughfare
each
moment
grew
more
tumultuous
to
his
ears
with
trolley
cars
and
taxis
motor
busses
trucks
and
drays
a
small
red
motor
dashed
uptown
with
piles
of
evening
papers
a
great
black
motor
hearse
rushed
by
in
a
taxi
which
had
stopped
in
a
jam
a
man
was
kissing
a
girl
in
his
arms
and
both
of
them
were
laughing
the
smart
little
toque
of
blue
satin
she
wore
was
crushed
to
one
side
how
red
were
her
lips
as
she
threw
back
her
head
silk
or
cotton
boss
which
you
like
roger
glanced
at
the
shoe
strings
and
pondered
silk
he
grunted
in
reply
idly
for
a
moment
he
watched
this
busy
little
man
from
whence
had
he
come
in
far
away
greece
what
existence
had
he
here
and
what
kind
of
life
would
he
still
have
through
those
many
years
to
come
a
feeling
half
of
sadness
crept
into
roger
heavy
eyes
as
he
looked
at
the
man
at
his
smiling
face
and
then
at
other
faces
in
the
multitudes
sweeping
past
the
moment
he
tried
to
single
them
out
how
doubly
chaotic
it
became
what
an
ocean
of
warm
desires
passions
vivid
hopes
and
worries
vaguely
he
could
feel
them
pass
often
in
the
midst
of
his
life
his
active
and
life
roger
had
looked
at
these
crowds
on
the
street
and
had
thought
these
faces
commonplace
but
now
at
the
end
it
was
not
so
a
woman
with
a
baby
carriage
stopped
directly
in
front
of
him
and
stood
there
anxiously
watching
for
a
chance
to
cross
the
street
and
roger
thought
of
deborah
heavily
he
climbed
down
from
his
seat
paid
the
man
and
bade
him
and
went
home
to
see
deborah
baby
for
a
long
time
he
sat
by
the
cradle
presently
deborah
joined
him
and
soon
they
were
laughing
heartily
at
the
astonishing
jerks
and
kicks
and
grimaces
of
the
tiny
boy
he
was
having
his
bath
and
he
hated
it
but
safe
at
last
on
his
mother
lap
wrapped
to
his
ears
in
a
big
soft
towel
he
grew
very
gay
and
contented
and
looked
waggishly
about
there
followed
long
lazy
days
of
spring
as
april
drifted
into
may
early
in
the
morning
roger
could
hear
through
his
window
the
cries
of
the
vendors
of
flowers
and
fruits
and
he
listened
drowsily
he
rose
late
and
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
house
but
occasionally
he
went
out
for
a
stroll
and
one
balmy
evening
when
groups
of
youths
came
trooping
by
singing
in
close
harmony
roger
called
a
taxi
and
went
far
down
through
the
tenement
streets
to
a
favorite
haunt
of
his
a
little
syrian
pawnshop
where
after
long
delving
he
purchased
a
ring
to
put
in
the
new
collection
that
he
had
been
making
lately
he
had
nearly
a
dozen
now
days
passed
the
house
was
still
so
quiet
deborah
was
still
upstairs
at
last
one
night
upon
leaving
his
study
he
stopped
uncertainly
in
the
hall
he
took
more
time
than
was
his
wont
in
closing
up
the
house
for
the
night
in
trying
all
the
windows
in
turning
out
the
various
lights
room
after
room
he
left
in
the
dark
then
he
went
slowly
up
the
stairs
his
hand
gratefully
feeling
those
guiding
points
grown
so
familiar
to
his
touch
through
many
thousand
evenings
his
hand
lingered
on
the
banister
and
he
stopped
again
to
listen
there
he
did
not
come
downstairs
again
he
was
able
to
sleep
but
little
at
night
turning
restlessly
on
his
bed
he
would
glance
out
of
the
window
up
at
the
beetling
wall
close
by
tier
on
tier
of
apartments
from
which
faint
voices
dropped
out
of
the
dark
gradually
as
the
night
wore
on
these
voices
would
all
die
away
into
long
mysterious
silences
for
to
him
at
least
such
silences
had
grown
to
be
very
mysterious
alone
in
the
hours
that
followed
even
these
modern
neighbors
and
this
strange
new
eager
town
pressing
down
upon
his
house
seemed
no
longer
strange
to
him
nor
so
appallingly
immense
seemed
even
familiar
and
small
to
him
as
the
eyes
of
his
mind
looked
out
ahead
from
his
bed
he
could
see
on
the
opposite
wall
the
picture
judith
had
given
him
always
so
fresh
and
cool
and
dim
with
its
deep
restful
tones
of
blue
of
the
herdsmen
and
the
cattle
on
the
dark
mountain
rim
at
dawn
and
vaguely
he
wondered
whether
it
was
because
he
saw
more
clearly
or
whether
his
mind
in
this
curious
haze
could
no
longer
see
so
well
that
as
he
looked
before
him
he
felt
no
fear
nor
any
more
uncertainty
all
his
doubts
had
lifted
he
was
so
sure
of
judith
now
as
though
she
were
coming
to
meet
him
her
image
grew
more
vivid
with
memories
emerging
out
of
all
the
years
gone
by
what
memories
what
vivid
scenes
what
intimate
conversations
they
had
her
voice
so
natural
close
in
his
ear
as
together
they
planned
for
their
children
wistfully
he
would
search
the
years
for
what
he
should
soon
tell
his
wife
until
the
drowsiness
returned
and
then
again
came
visions
but
by
day
it
was
not
so
for
the
life
of
the
house
would
rouse
him
and
at
intervals
hold
his
attention
one
evening
a
slight
rustle
a
faint
fragrance
in
the
room
made
roger
suddenly
open
his
eyes
and
he
saw
laura
by
his
bed
her
slender
figure
clad
in
blue
silk
something
white
at
her
full
bosom
he
noticed
her
shapely
shoulders
her
glossy
hair
and
moist
red
lips
she
was
smiling
down
at
him
see
what
i
brought
you
dear
she
said
and
she
turned
to
a
chair
where
one
on
the
other
tray
after
tray
was
piled
his
whole
collection
of
rings
at
sight
of
them
his
eyes
grew
fixed
he
could
feel
his
pulse
beat
faster
how
did
you
ever
find
them
he
asked
his
daughter
huskily
oh
i
had
a
long
hunt
all
by
myself
but
i
found
them
at
last
and
brought
them
home
shall
we
look
them
over
a
little
while
yes
he
said
she
turned
up
the
light
and
came
and
sat
down
at
the
bedside
with
a
tray
of
rings
in
her
lap
one
by
one
she
held
them
up
to
his
gaze
still
smiling
and
talking
softly
on
in
that
rich
melodious
voice
of
hers
of
which
he
heard
but
snatches
how
good
it
felt
to
be
so
gay
no
solemn
thoughts
nor
questionings
just
these
dusky
glittering
beauties
here
deep
soft
gleams
of
color
each
with
its
suggestion
of
memories
for
roger
a
procession
of
adventures
reaching
back
into
his
life
he
smiled
and
lay
in
silence
watching
until
at
last
she
bent
over
him
kissed
him
softly
breathed
a
and
went
out
of
the
room
roger
followed
her
with
his
glance
he
knew
he
would
never
see
her
again
how
graceful
of
her
to
go
like
that
he
lay
there
thinking
about
her
in
her
large
blue
limousine
he
saw
his
gay
young
daughter
speeding
up
the
avenue
the
purple
gleaming
pavement
reflecting
studded
lines
of
lights
and
he
thought
he
could
see
her
smiling
still
he
recalled
scattered
fragments
of
her
life
the
first
luxurious
little
ménage
and
the
second
how
many
more
would
there
be
she
was
only
in
her
twenties
still
uneasily
he
tried
to
see
into
the
years
ahead
for
her
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
lonely
old
age
childless
loveless
cynical
hard
but
this
fear
soon
fell
from
his
mind
no
whatever
happened
she
would
do
it
gracefully
an
artist
always
to
the
end
he
sighed
and
gave
up
the
effort
for
he
could
not
think
of
laura
as
old
nor
could
he
think
of
her
any
more
as
being
a
part
of
his
family
edith
came
to
him
several
times
and
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
gave
him
sharp
forebodings
making
a
great
effort
he
tried
to
talk
to
her
clearly
it
hard
to
keep
up
with
your
children
he
said
it
means
keeping
up
with
everything
new
and
you
stay
in
your
rut
and
then
it
too
late
before
you
know
it
you
are
old
but
his
words
subsided
in
mutterings
and
roger
wearily
closed
his
eyes
for
a
glance
up
into
edith
face
had
shown
him
only
pity
there
and
no
heed
to
his
warning
he
saw
that
she
looked
upon
him
as
old
and
still
upon
herself
as
young
though
he
noticed
the
threads
of
gray
in
her
hair
then
he
realized
she
had
gone
and
that
his
chamber
had
grown
dark
he
must
have
been
dreaming
of
what
he
asked
he
tried
to
remember
and
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
so
harsh
and
clear
it
startled
him
a
picture
rose
in
roger
mind
of
a
stark
lonely
figure
a
woman
in
a
graveyard
cutting
the
grass
on
family
graves
where
had
he
seen
it
he
could
not
recall
what
had
it
to
do
with
edith
was
she
not
living
in
new
york
what
had
so
startled
him
just
now
some
thought
some
vivid
picture
some
nightmare
he
could
not
recall
his
last
talks
were
with
deborah
all
through
those
days
and
the
long
nights
too
he
kept
fancying
she
was
in
the
room
and
it
brought
deep
balm
to
his
restless
soul
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
about
the
schools
and
deborah
talked
to
him
quietly
she
was
going
back
to
her
work
in
the
fall
she
felt
very
humble
about
it
she
told
him
she
felt
older
now
and
she
saw
that
her
work
was
barely
begun
but
she
was
even
happier
than
before
her
hand
lay
in
his
and
it
tightened
there
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
up
into
hers
all
so
strange
he
muttered
life
there
was
a
sharp
contracting
of
her
wide
and
sensitive
mouth
yes
dear
strange
she
whispered
but
i
so
glad
you
going
on
he
frowned
as
he
tried
to
be
simple
and
clear
and
make
her
feel
he
understood
what
she
had
set
herself
to
do
all
people
he
said
slowly
never
counted
so
much
as
now
and
never
so
hungry
all
as
now
for
all
of
life
like
children
children
who
should
go
to
school
your
work
will
grow
i
can
see
ahead
never
a
time
when
every
man
and
woman
and
child
could
grow
so
much
and
hand
it
on
and
hand
it
on
as
you
will
do
to
your
small
son
he
felt
her
hand
on
his
forehead
and
for
some
moments
nothing
was
said
vaguely
in
glimpses
roger
saw
his
small
grandson
growing
up
and
he
pictured
other
children
here
not
her
own
but
of
her
greater
family
as
the
two
merged
into
one
he
felt
that
she
would
not
grow
old
children
lives
of
children
work
dreams
and
aspirations
how
bright
it
seemed
as
he
stared
ahead
then
he
heard
the
cry
of
her
baby
shall
i
nurse
him
here
he
heard
her
ask
he
pressed
her
hand
in
answer
and
when
again
he
opened
his
eyes
she
was
by
his
side
with
the
child
at
her
breast
its
large
round
eyes
so
pure
and
clear
gazed
into
his
own
for
a
long
long
time
now
he
so
sleepy
she
whispered
would
you
like
him
beside
you
a
moment
please
he
felt
the
faint
scent
of
the
tiny
boy
and
still
those
eyes
looked
into
his
he
forgot
his
daughter
standing
there
and
as
he
watched
a
sweet
fresh
sense
of
the
mystery
of
this
life
so
new
stole
deep
into
his
spirit
all
at
once
the
baby
fell
asleep
little
brother
he
whispered
god
grant
the
world
be
very
kind
he
could
feel
the
mother
lift
it
up
and
he
heard
the
door
close
softly
smiling
he
too
fell
asleep
and
after
that
there
were
only
dreams
chapter
xliv
and
his
dreams
were
of
children
their
faces
passed
before
him
now
they
were
young
again
in
the
house
they
were
eating
their
suppers
three
small
girls
chattering
like
magpies
from
her
end
of
the
table
their
mother
smiled
quietly
across
at
him
come
children
she
was
saying
that
will
do
for
a
little
while
but
roger
said
oh
let
them
then
he
saw
bruce
came
in
with
edith
and
george
and
young
elizabeth
and
allan
came
with
deborah
who
had
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
laura
stood
beside
them
here
were
his
three
daughters
grown
but
still
in
some
uncanny
way
they
looked
to
him
like
children
still
and
behind
them
he
detected
figures
long
forgotten
of
boys
and
girls
whom
he
had
known
far
back
in
his
own
childhood
john
too
had
come
into
the
house
strangely
now
the
walls
were
gone
had
lifted
and
a
clamorous
throng
laughing
shouting
pummeling
hedged
him
in
on
every
hand
deborah
big
family
soon
the
uproar
wearied
him
and
roger
tried
to
shut
them
out
to
bring
back
again
the
walls
to
his
house
and
sometimes
he
succeeded
and
he
was
left
for
a
while
in
peace
with
judith
and
his
three
small
girls
but
despite
his
efforts
to
keep
them
there
new
faces
kept
intruding
swiftly
his
small
family
grew
split
into
other
families
and
these
were
merged
with
other
figures
pressing
in
from
every
side
again
he
felt
the
presence
of
countless
families
all
around
dividing
reuniting
with
ceaseless
changes
and
fresh
life
a
never
ending
multitude
here
they
were
singing
and
dancing
and
laura
gaily
waved
to
him
at
another
place
were
only
men
and
they
were
struggling
savagely
to
clutch
things
from
each
hands
a
sea
of
scowling
visages
angry
shouts
fists
clinched
in
air
and
he
thought
he
saw
bruce
for
an
instant
behind
them
lay
wide
valleys
obscured
by
heavy
clouds
of
smoke
and
he
could
hear
the
roar
of
guns
but
they
vanished
suddenly
and
he
saw
women
mourning
now
and
edith
with
her
children
turned
to
him
her
anxious
eyes
he
tried
to
reach
and
help
her
but
already
she
had
gone
and
behind
her
came
huge
bending
forms
men
heaving
at
great
burdens
jaws
set
in
scowls
of
fierce
revolt
and
john
was
there
on
his
crutches
and
near
him
was
a
figure
bound
into
a
chair
of
steel
with
terror
in
the
straining
limbs
while
in
desperation
deborah
tried
to
wrench
him
free
abruptly
roger
turned
away
and
in
a
twinkling
all
was
gone
the
tumult
and
the
clamor
and
he
was
in
a
silent
place
high
up
on
a
mountain
side
it
was
dusk
a
herd
of
cattle
passed
and
george
came
close
behind
them
and
around
him
roger
saw
emerging
from
the
faces
turning
like
his
own
to
the
summits
of
the
mountains
and
the
billowy
splendors
there
it
grew
so
dark
he
could
see
no
more
there
fell
a
deep
silence
not
a
sound
but
the
occasional
chirp
of
a
bird
or
the
faint
whirr
of
an
insect
even
the
glow
on
the
peaks
was
gone
darkness
only
darkness
surely
this
is
death
he
thought
after
that
he
was
alone
and
presently
from
far
away
he
heard
the
booming
of
a
bell
deep
and
slow
sepulchral
as
it
measured
off
his
life
another
silence
followed
and
this
time
it
was
more
profound
and
with
a
breathless
awe
he
knew
that
all
the
people
who
had
ever
lived
on
earth
were
before
him
in
the
void
to
which
he
himself
was
drifting
people
of
all
nations
of
countless
generations
reaching
back
and
back
and
back
to
the
beginnings
of
mankind
the
mightiest
family
of
all
that
had
stumbled
up
through
the
ages
had
slaved
and
starved
and
dreamed
and
died
had
blindly
hated
blindly
killed
had
raised
up
gods
and
idols
and
yearned
for
everlasting
life
had
laughed
and
played
and
danced
along
had
loved
and
mated
given
birth
had
endlessly
renewed
itself
and
handed
on
its
heritage
had
striven
hungrily
to
learn
had
groped
its
way
in
darkness
and
after
all
its
struggles
had
come
now
barely
to
the
dawn
and
then
a
voice
within
him
cried
what
is
humanity
but
a
child
in
the
name
of
the
dead
i
salute
the
unborn
slowly
a
glow
appeared
in
his
dream
and
once
again
the
scene
had
changed
the
light
was
coming
from
long
rows
of
houses
rising
tall
and
steep
out
of
a
teeming
city
street
and
from
these
lighted
houses
children
now
came
pouring
forth
they
filled
the
street
from
wall
to
wall
with
a
torrent
of
warm
vivid
hues
they
joined
in
mad
tempestuous
games
they
shouted
and
they
danced
with
glee
they
whirled
each
other
and
the
very
air
seemed
quivering
then
was
heard
the
crash
of
a
band
and
he
saw
them
marching
into
school
in
and
in
and
in
they
pressed
till
the
school
seemed
fairly
bursting
out
they
came
by
another
way
and
went
off
marching
down
the
street
with
the
big
flag
waving
at
their
head
he
followed
and
saw
the
street
divide
into
narrower
streets
and
into
roads
and
country
lanes
and
all
were
filled
with
children
in
endless
multitudes
they
came
marching
marching
spreading
spreading
like
wide
bobbing
fields
of
flowers
rolling
out
across
the
land
toward
a
great
round
flashing
sun
above
a
distant
rim
of
hills
the
sun
rose
strangely
dazzling
it
filled
the
heavens
with
blinding
light
he
felt
himself
drawn
up
and
up
while
from
somewhere
far
behind
he
heard
the
cry
of
deborah
child
a
clear
sweet
thrill
of
happiness
came
and
after
that
we
do
not
know
for
he
had
left
his
family
printed
in
the
united
states
of
america
