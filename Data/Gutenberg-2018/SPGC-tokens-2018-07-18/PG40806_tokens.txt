preface
when
i
began
to
write
these
stories
about
children
of
all
lands
i
had
just
returned
from
europe
whither
i
journeyed
with
marie
and
ref
maybe
you
do
know
marie
and
ref
i
introduce
them
please
meet
marie
my
very
little
daughter
and
ref
my
very
big
reflex
camera
these
two
are
my
helpers
marie
helps
by
being
a
little
girl
who
knows
what
other
little
girls
like
and
by
telling
me
and
ref
helps
by
snapping
pictures
of
everything
interesting
that
marie
and
i
see
on
our
travels
i
could
get
along
without
them
several
years
have
gone
by
since
we
started
our
work
together
and
marie
is
a
bigger
girl
but
ref
has
changed
one
bit
ref
has
changed
any
more
than
my
interest
in
writing
these
books
for
you
and
i
hope
that
hope
that
i
never
change
because
i
want
to
keep
on
writing
until
we
have
no
more
countries
to
write
about
unless
of
course
some
one
discovers
a
new
country
even
if
a
new
country
is
discovered
we
find
foreign
children
to
talk
about
maybe
the
children
in
mars
who
knows
nobody
not
even
marie
and
marie
usually
knows
about
most
things
that

reason
why

madame
villard
the
baby
is
a
dear
little
girl
madame
villard
said
the
nurse
madame
villard
came
forward
and
her
face
expressed
the
joy
in
her
heart
it
was
the
twilight
hour
paris
was
busily
honking
and
tooting
outside
the
broad
windows
of
madame
villard
apartment
the
apartment
looked
out
upon
one
of
paris
finest
avenues
and
paris
has
many
fine
avenues
this
had
been
madame
villard
home
for
many
years
illustration
the
apartment
on
avenue
champs
elysées
where
madame
villard
lived
it
was
here
she
had
raised
her
family
her
boy
and
her
girl
it
was
the
same
girl
whose
dear
little
baby
had
just
come
into
the
world
may
i
may
i
see
her
asked
madame
villard
softly
the
nurse
led
her
into
the
room
and
the
grandmother
looked
with
eyes
upon
this
first
grandchild
baby
margot
was
madame
first
grandchild
at
least
that
is
what
madame
thought
little
did
madame
villard
know
that
at
this
same
moment
another
grandchild
of
hers
was
opening
wondering
brown
eyes
upon
the
same
world
the
same
world
and
the
same
country
france
yet
how
different
was
this
other
grandchild
world
from
the
world
of
little
margot
little
soft
comfy
margot
in
her
billowy
pink
and
lace
down
little
soft
cuddly
margot
whom
grandmother
took
into
her
arms
that
day
all
the
while
she
did
not
know
about
the
other
grandchild
that
other
grandchild
did
not
have
soft
billowy
pink
and
lace
pillows
on
which
to
rest
her
head
that
other
grandchild
did
not
have
a
grandmother
loving
arms
into
which
she
could
cuddle
down
that
other
grandchild
but
i
must
not
talk
of
her
i
must
talk
of
margot
for
margot
was
all
that
grandmother
villard
could
talk
about
or
even
think
of
that
day
her
own
little
daughter
daughter
it
was
so
wonderful
to
think
of
margot
being
here
so
wonderful
for
poor
madame
villard
whose
only
son
paul
was
fighting
at
the
front
in
the
great
war
when
the
war
had
started
paul
had
gone
to
fight
for
france
now
it
was
many
months
since
madame
had
heard
from
her
soldier
boy
soon
after
paul
had
joined
the
army
he
had
met
and
married
jeanne
jēn
in
a
tiny
village
of
france
paul
had
written
to
his
mother
in
paris
telling
her
of
his
marriage

jeanne
wrote
paul
when
this
war
is
over
i
shall
bring
her
to
paris
but
the
war
was
not
over
and
jeanne
had
never
been
brought
to
paris
madame
villard
did
not
hear
from
her
boy
again
she
did
not
know
that
on
this
happy
day
while
she
held
her
little
grandchild
margot
in
her
arms
paul
little
girl
was
opening
her
brown
eyes
upon
a
world
in
a
sad
bleak
little
village
far
from
paris
this
other
grandchild
was
born
chapter
ii
paul
jeanne
baby
was
as
beautiful
as
little
margot
though
she
did
not
lie
upon
lacy
pillows
in
a
paris
apartment
jeanne
held
the
child
tightly
in
her
arms
as
she
rocked
back
and
forth
on
a
broken
chair
and
as
she
rocked
she
looked
out
upon
the
poor
little
village
street
jeanne
was
a
troubled
young
mother
paul
had
been
at
the
front
for
many
weeks
now
he
did
not
even
know
that
little
jeanne
was
born
if
only
paul
would
come
back
to
the
village
there
was
talk
of
an
invasion
many
small
towns
of
france
were
being
invaded
and
burned
by
the
enemy
would
this
little
town
be
next
each
day
the
villagers
asked
themselves
this
question
and
lived
in
terror
many
had
already
started
to
tramp
toward
paris
many
were
deserting
the
village
but
jeanne
could
not
go
there
was
little
jeanne
now
and
even
if
she
could
have
gone
she
would
never
have
left
until
her
paul
had
come
back
each
day
a
letter
went
to
paul
at
the
front
each
day
jeanne
trembled
at
the
postman
footsteps
outside
her
door
but
no
news
only
whispers
and
more
whispers
of
invasion
invasion
oh
if
paul
would
only
come
back
jeanne
rocked
her
baby
the
invasion
came
it
was
one
of
the
last
invasions
before
the
great
war
came
to
an
end
the
enemy
burned
the
little
town
to
the
ground
the
great
march
of
the
refugees
had
started
the
roads
to
paris
were
alive
with
homeless
people
struggling
homeless
humanity
with
only
the
hope
of
reaching
paris
alive
the
village
paul
village
was
a
desolate
place
as
the
troop
of
french
soldiers
returned
after
the
invasion
and
marched
into
it
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
among
those
marching
french
soldiers
came
paul
illustration
a
group
of
typical
thatch
roofed
houses
in
a
little
french
village
to
the
scene
of
his
home
he
ran
everything
everything
was
in
ruins
his
house
gone
his
wife
jeanne
jeanne
paul
voice
was
a
shriek
look
my
son
in
the
cellar
many
of
them
hid
in
cellars
for
days
before
it
was
a
old
man
speaking
the
distracted
paul
dashed
into
the
underground
stone
cave
and
called
again
jeanne
oh
jeanne
a
little
sound
came
from
a
corner
in
the
dark
damp
cellar
the
soldier
stopped
suddenly
and
his
ears
became
those
of
a
forest
animal
so
sharp
so
alert
was
he
my
little
one
jeanne
he
called
he
struck
a
match
his
heart
nearly
stopped
his
jeanne
was
not
there
but
something
moved
in
the
corner
something
small
and
white
a
baby
paul
gasped
his
voice
had
dropped
to
a
husky
whisper
he
lifted
the
small
white
bundle
it
was
a
baby
a
tiny
young
baby
the
soldier
carried
the
child
out
into
the
light
the
little
one
touched
his
cheek
with
a
pink
hand
a
baby
breathed
paul
as
he
held
this
bit
of
humanity
close
in
his
arms
and
my
jeanne
we
were
to
have
had
one
like
this
soon
then
paul
noticed
something
around
the
baby
neck
a
small
locket
had
been
tied
around
her
neck
with
a
piece
of
faded
ribbon
with
trembling
fingers
paul
opened
the
locket
the
soldier
brushed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
for
he
could
not
believe
what
he
saw
inside
the
locket
was
his
picture
chapter
iii
to
the
front
paul
sat
there
and
rocked
the
baby
his
baby
he
sat
and
rocked
little
jeanne
much
as
his
wife
had
rocked
her
before
that
terrible
invasion
now
his
wife
was
gone
little
jeanne
mother
had
not
been
able
to
escape
as
had
many
of
the
other
villagers
she
was
dead
weak
and
undernourished
the
poor
woman
had
been
unable
to
withstand
hardships
and
suffering
in
a
cold
damp
cellar
the
invasion
had
killed
little
jeanne
mother
paul
alone
now
remained
to
care
for
this
helpless
mite
paul
was
a
troubled
frantic
soldier
he
would
be
called
back
to
the
front
at
any
moment
what
would
he
do
with
the
baby
just
then
he
heard
the
bugle
and
the
call
to
arms
to
the
front
a
scurrying
soldier
passed
him
and
called
out
make
haste
to
the
front
paul
could
not
move
the
baby
was
asleep
in
his
arms
little
trusting
baby
his
baby
the
soldier
dropped
his
head
in
the
folds
of
little
jeanne
dress
and
sobbed
a
slight
tap
upon
his
shoulder
brought
paul
head
erect
bending
over
him
was
the
same
old
man
it
was
the
little
peasant
who
had
spoken
to
him
at
the
cellar
door
come
my
son
he
said
you
are
a
soldier
of
france
would
that
my
old
body
could
fight
in
your
place
but
it
is
you
who
must
go
france
needs
you
my
son
he
slowly
helped
the
soldier
to
his
feet
as
the
baby
in
his
arms
slept
on
paul
saw
the
light
of
goodness
shining
out
of
the
old
eyes
with
a
surge
of
joy
in
his
heart
he
held
out
his
child
oh
my
friend
he
cried
if
you
will
take
my
baby
i
can
go
i
can
then
go
and
fight
for
france
but
never
never
could
i
leave
her
alone
even
for
france
take
her
friend
and
guard
her
with
your
life
illustration
a
typical
hamlet
in
a
beautiful
section
of
france
the
old
peasant
eyes
grew
troubled
for
he
knew
not
what
he
a
weakened
old
man
might
do
with
an
infant
here
in
this
smoldering
ruin
of
a
village
but
he
held
out
his
arms
yes
i
shall
take
care
of
her
he
promised
with
your
life
my
friend
repeated
paul
here
he
added
as
he
pulled
from
his
pockets
handfuls
of
small
coins
all
i
have
take
it
take
her
to
paris
to
my
mother
wait
and
paul
then
wrote
a
note
a
scrawled
jumbled
note
to
his
mother
madame
villard
in
paris
i
am
telling
her
you
are
coming
with
my
baby
with
little
jeanne
he
said
take
her
to
the
address
i
write
on
this
paper
see
i
pin
it
to
her
little
skirt
hurry
my
friend
take
her
take
her
adieu
adieu
my
little
jeanne
the
last
words
were
heard
afar
off
as
the
father
of
little
jeanne
joined
his
regiment
then
he
marched
to
the
front
into
the
face
of
a
cruel
battle
the
old
man
stood
still
and
watched
the
soldier
disappearing
he
and
this
baby
were
the
only
remaining
inhabitants
in
this
town
the
rest
were
marching
marching
on
their
way
to
paris
he
too
must
march
to
paris
an
old
man
with
a
baby
it
was
a
long
way
but
he
had
given
his
word
to
a
soldier
of
france
did
this
not
make
of
him
a
soldier
too
the
old
body
stiffened
and
he
stood
erect
his
hand
slowly
saluted
the
departing
troops
he
too
was
a
soldier
he
looked
at
the
address
which
paul
had
pinned
to
the
skirt
of
little
jeanne
madame
villard
avenue
champs
elysées
paris
paris
why
yes
he
could
walk
to
paris
he
was
a
soldier
marching
refugees
from
other
villages
were
constantly
passing
the
old
man
joined
the
peasant
procession
on
his
lips
were
the
words
on
on
on
to
paris
on
on
on
and
little
jeanne
thought
it
was
a
lullaby
and
slept
chapter
iv
on
to
paris
on
trudged
the
old
man
in
his
arms
slept
little
jeanne
she
was
as
happy
as
margot
that
day
margot
lay
among
the
cushions
of
her
baby
carriage
and
was
rolled
along
the
smooth
walks
of
paris
parks
but
little
jeanne
carriage
was
not
so
soft
nor
did
it
roll
along
indeed
the
old
man
gait
grew
more
and
more
jerky
with
every
step
he
watched
the
rest
of
the
refugees
passing
him
by
there
were
families
with
many
children
there
were
men
and
women
carrying
mattresses
and
clothing
pots
and
pans
there
were
dogs
running
along
and
barking
they
all
passed
the
old
man
each
one
had
another
with
whom
to
walk
but
the
old
man
walked
alone
it
grew
very
hard
this
walking
he
rested
often
and
each
time
it
was
harder
to
rise
and
to
start
the
walk
again
only
his
promise
to
a
soldier
of
france
kept
his
old
body
going
at
last
he
dropped
heavily
at
the
side
of
the
road
jeanne
was
asleep
the
thud
awoke
her
the
old
man
could
go
no
farther
jeanne
did
not
cry
she
was
happy
and
satisfied
she
had
been
well
cared
for
when
they
had
passed
farms
with
cows
little
jeanne
had
been
fed
the
old
man
looked
at
her
and
touched
the
little
soft
cheek
with
his
horny
hand
little
one
i
am
finished
he
whispered
i
have
tried
so
hard
but
paris
is
too
far
too
far
it
is
too
far
to
the
front
with
that
the
old
man
slept
jeanne
lay
in
his
arms
and
blew
bubbles
to
the
sky
she
watched
the
trees
as
they
swayed
back
and
forth
this
world
is
a
pleasant
place
it
would
seem
the
tiny
girl
was
thinking
illustration
very
old
stone
houses
in
a
little
village
of
france
for
a
long
time
the
old
man
slept
he
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
a
clear
voice
he
looked
into
the
sad
face
of
a
young
woman
in
a
black
shawl
she
was
holding
jeanne
two
little
hands
in
her
fingers
is
this
your
baby
she
asked
no
no
my
child
i
am
taking
her
to
paris
to
he
tried
to
lift
himself
but
fell
back
again
you
are
spent
you
must
not
carry
this
child
any
farther
come
give
her
to
me
said
the
woman
she
took
little
jeanne
in
her
arms
the
old
man
eyes
searched
her
face
to
try
to
fathom
it
he
tried
to
find
there
what
he
hoped
to
see
kindness
but
all
he
saw
was
sadness
suzanne
moreau
was
one
of
the
many
refugees
who
had
fled
from
her
invaded
village
she
was
one
of
the
few
in
that
long
line
who
marched
alone
suzanne
had
always
lived
alone
as
long
as
she
could
remember
her
life
had
been
a
lonely
one
she
had
been
a
dressmaker
in
the
small
town
where
she
had
lived
everyone
there
had
known
her
as
auntie
sue
she
was
auntie
sue
to
children
and
alike
the
old
man
tried
to
fathom
suzanne
as
he
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
and
watched
her
wrap
little
jeanne
carefully
in
her
shawl
i
am
quite
alone
she
said
i
am
strong
and
shall
make
the
march
easily
do
not
fear
she
gave
her
hand
to
the
old
man
and
he
kissed
it
god
bless
you
he
breathed
then

was
a
month
since
the
day
when
madame
villard
had
received
two
letters
just
a
month
had
passed
since
the
lady
and
her
daughter
had
pored
over
two
such
different
letters
one
was
a
scrawl
paul
he
wrote
that
his
baby
was
on
her
way
to
paris
to
her
grandmother
it
was
a
dirty
scrawly
note
but
full
of
hope
to
the
two
who
read
it
the
next
letter
neat
and
precise
was
from
the
government
before
they
opened
it

two
women

though
he
had
returned
to
his

ones
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
walk
he
would
be
an

for

had
two
helpless

to

a

but
despite
the
happiness
of
her

the
heart
of
madame

yearned
for
that
other
wee
one
her
son
little
orphaned
daughter
she
waited
longingly
for
paul
child
to
be
brought
to
her
she
waited
until
she
could
wait
no
longer
then
she
went
out
in
search
of
little
jeanne
madame
villard
traveled
to
many
villages
in
her
search
she
even
asked
the
government
to
help
her
she
tried
so
hard
to
speed
the
little
one
arrival
but
she
could
not
the
child
was
never
brought
to
her
and
now
a
month
having
elapsed
madame
villard
was
again
preparing
to
motor
through
the
country
to
search
she
intended
to
stop
at
a
little
graveyard
in
the
argonne
and
pray
illustration
a
unique
old
windmill
in
picturesque
france
and
while
madame
villard
waited
thus
for
little
jeanne
suzanne
moreau
was
bringing
the
baby
to
paris
on
the
tramp
suzanne
had
found
the
child
a
sweet
and
tender
thing
little
jeanne
had
hardly
ever
cried
she
was
satisfied
and
sleepy
or
gurgling
and
gay
her
life
had
been
a
rough
one
and
her
feedings
irregular
and
sometimes
insufficient
still
the
baby
had
seemed
happy
and
suzanne
had
smiled
a
great
deal
more
than
she
had
ever
before
smiled
in
her
life
before
the
march
was
over
little
jeanne
was
the
only
child
suzanne
had
ever
kissed
for
a
long
time
after
reaching
paris
suzanne
moreau
only
thought
was
to
tend
this
baby
for
whom
she
had
promised
to
care
she
expected
to
take
the
baby
to
the
home
where
it
belonged
but
her
first
thought
was
to
give
the
child
a
few
days
good
care
and
food
before
giving
her
up
it
was
a
thought
which
suzanne
would
never
have
admitted
was
selfish
but
the
truth
was
that
little
jeanne
baby
fingers
had
so
tenderly
wound
themselves
about
the
heart
of
suzanne
moreau
that
already
the
thought
of
parting
with
her
was
unbearable
a
few
days
passed
then
a
week
and
then
more
days
i
should
i
should
sighed
suzanne
as
she
watched
the
little
girl
sucking
contentedly
on
her
bottle
then
when
the
bottle
was
emptied
baby
jeanne
lifted
her
two
pink
hands
in
her
arms
suzanne
rocked
the
baby
back
and
forth
and
murmured
no
no
my
little
one
ma
chérie
mä
which
means
my
dear
in
french
i
can
not
give
you
up
not
yet
this
went
on
for
some
time
at
last
one
night
suzanne
determined
to
go
to
that
address
on
the
avenue
champs
elysées
she
went
alone
she
left
the
child
in
the
care
of
a
woman
with
whom
she
boarded
before
the
tall
stone
building
suzanne
stood
and
marveled
it
seemed
a
palace
to
the
little
village
dressmaker
how
could
she
keep
this
child
from
a
home
like
that
yes
she
would
take
jeanne
to
her
rightful
home
as
she
turned
to
leave
a
big
motor
car
drew
up
at
the
curb
and
a
black
figure
stepped
out
madame
villard
had
returned
from
another
unsuccessful
search
she
was
returning
to
her
daughter
and
to
little
margot
discouraged
disappointed
and
little
did
she
know
that
the
slight
figure
turning
the
corner
was
suzanne
moreau
little
did
she
dream
that
this
woman
turning
the
corner
was
hurrying
back
to
her
own
grandchild
who
slept
in
a
poor
little
paris
boarding
house
illustration
the
marie
antoinette
cottage
near
versailles
palace
suzanne
began
to
arrange
the
few
little
clothes
she
had
bought
for
jeanne
she
made
a
bundle
then
she
took
from
her
drawer
the
locket
which
the
child
had
worn
about
her
neck
she
opened
it
paul
face
seemed
to
be
smiling
at
her
often
before
she
had
opened
this
locket
but
never
had
the
soldier
face
seemed
so
happy
as
now
suzanne
knew
why
it
was
because
she
was
going
to
take
jeanne
to
her
place
her
rightful
home
her
heart
was
fluttering
and
her
hands
were
shaking
as
she
put
the
locket
about
the
child
neck
then
she
sat
by
the
little
cradle
before
she
knew
it
the
tears
were
falling
down
her
cheeks
why
did
she
care
this
way
suzanne
asked
herself
she
had
lived
alone
for
many
years
for
many
years
she
had
had
nothing
to
love
why
could
she
not
go
on
why
must
this
tiny
bit
of
life
sleeping
so
sweetly
before
her
make
all
this
difference
and
make
her
cry
jeanne
stirred
the
little
pink
hands
went
up
it
was
a
gesture
suzanne
had
come
to
love
to
wait
for
to
thrill
at
slowly
she
raised
jeanne
from
the
cradle
and
held
her
the
baby
hands
gently
touched
her
cheeks
one
little
hand
was
patting
a
wet
wet
cheek
then
it
stopped
and
a
soft
head
slowly
sank
upon
suzanne
breast
jeanne
was
asleep
suzanne
sat
staring
ahead
of
her
the
baby
had
made
a
decision
for
suzanne
cruelly
and
unfairly
in
her
mind
suzanne
blamed
little
jeanne
for
the
decision
she
made
that
night
but
her
torn
heart
could
not
have
stood
the
blame
she
knew
and
felt
only
one
thing
to
the
sleeping
child
she
cried
i
can
not
can
not
give
you
up
my
little
jeanne
never
never
the
locket
with
the
soldier
picture
was
put
away
under
lock
and
key
and
madame
villard
continued
to
wait
for
her
grandchild

several
years

jeanne
was
now
a
tall
girl
but
still
auntie
sue
had
a
terrible
feeling
about
that
apartment

suzanne
was
still
known
as
auntie

and
between
the
poor
little
dressmaker
and

had
grown
up

most
fashionable

come
nearly
everyone

visits

french

know
well
how

fitted

came
from

italy

and
from
other
parts

world
for
auntie

was
well
known

was
known
because
for
one
thing
auntie
sue
was
clever
and
could
make
beautiful
clothes
illustration
the
window
of
auntie
sue
shop
in
paris
it
was
known
for
another
reason
and
perhaps
a
better
one
that
reason
was
jeanne
jeanne
put
on
all
of
auntie
little
models
she
showed
them
to
the
people
who
came
to
buy
clothes
for
their
children
jeanne
walked
about
the
pretty
little
room
with
its
dainty
and
parisian
dolls
and
model
coats
and
hats
she
walked
about
the
room
and
wore
the
clothes
that
auntie
sue
had
made
and
when
the
children
mothers
came
to
buy
they
said
is
that
a
beautiful
little
coat
or
does
she
look
sweet
in
that
little
dress
jeanne
always
looked
sweet
and
pretty
in
everything
she
wore
jeanne
walked
very
straight
and
held
her
head
high
and
smiled
at
all
the
people
she
seemed
to
belong
in
those
clothes
so
every
mother
thought
that
her
child
would
look
as
well
as
jeanne
looked
of
course
some
of
them
did
but
not
all
jeanne
was
known
throughout
paris
throughout
as
the
little
model
you
may
think
that
she
became
haughty
and
proud
because
so
many
people
knew
about
her
and
came
to
watch
her
but
this
was
not
the
case
at
all
jeanne
never
thought
of
things
like
that
she
was
too
busy
ever
to
think
of
such
things
while
she
loved
to
help
auntie
sue
it
was
hard
work
and
often
auntie
sue
worried
ma
chérie
she
would
say
to
jeanne
as
she
stroked
her
silky
brown
curls
you
are
happy
are
you
not
you
do
not
mind
the
work
the
hard
hard
work
ah
jeanne
it
is
not
pleasant
sometimes
i
know
and
this
was
true
for
when
many
many
mothers
and
children
came
jeanne
had
to
walk
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
through
the
room
she
had
to
show
the
silken
dresses
the
velvet
coats
the
little
fluffy
bonnets
and
hats
and
she
always
had
to
smile
and
answer
people
questions
to
the
tune
of
that
smile
then
when
changing
behind
the
screen
in
auntie
tiny
dressing
room
she
had
to
be
careful
with
the
clothes
very
careful
if
lace
should
tear
or
a
frock
become
soiled
auntie
would
not
be
able
to
sell
it
it
was
a
careful
little
girl
who
changed
behind
that
screen
illustration
she
had
to
be
careful
with
the
clothes
but
jeanne
would
always
answer
auntie
as
she
smiled
into
her
worried
eyes
no
no
dear
auntie
sue
never
am
i
sad
never
do
i
mind
the
work
it
is
play
you
know
all
the
other
little
children
envy
me
this
also
was
true
many
children
did
think
what
fun
it
would
be
to
wear
all
those
lovely
clothes
and
step
about
that
gay
little
shop
some
even
went
home
and
tried
to
imitate
jeanne
they
thought
it
was
fun
they
did
not
know
it
was
hard
hard
work
jeanne
answered
auntie
sue
this
way
and
really
meant
what
she
said
still
jeanne
often
wished
for
the
days
to
be
much
longer
jeanne
wanted
to
play
it
was
all
right
for
those
other
children
to
play
at
being
jeanne
but
really
to
be
jeanne
was
not
play
when
those
other
children
wearied
of
their
game
of
being
jeanne
they
stopped
jeanne
could
never
stop
and
there
was
never
any
time
left
for
her
to
play
auntie
sue
often
noticed
that
jeanne
eyes
held
a
wistful
look
auntie
sue
mistook
that
wistfulness
and
thought
jeanne
was
longing
to
possess
the
beautiful
clothes
she
showed
she
thought
that
jeanne
was
sad
because
each
day
she
would
have
to
take
off
those
lovely
clothes
and
put
on
her
own
simple
little
dresses
it
was
only
natural
for
auntie
to
suppose
this
because
jeanne
loved
and
caressed
each
new
garment
that
auntie
made
she
seemed
always
so
happy
to
put
them
on
but
here
is
a
secret
jeanne
never
once
thought
about
those
clothes
after
she
took
them
off
she
liked
her
little
gingham
dresses
just
as
well
in
fact
jeanne
would
not
have
cared
one
bit
what
she
wore
if
only
she
could
have
played
auntie
sue
did
not
know

one
morning
major
received

letter
from
an
old

was
a
good
friend
madame

wrote
that
she
expected
to
spend
a
night
at

tiny
tumbled
farm

before
the
war
it
had
been
his
fine
and
prosperous
home
but
the
major
had
been
obliged
to
turn
his
home
into
a
hotel
for
the
war
had
made
him
a
poor
man
fighting
and
scenes
of
horror
had
taken
place
on
that
peaceful
farm
it
had
been
occupied
by
the
germans
later
a
terrible
battle
one
of
the
famous

had
been
fought
there

to
see

were
curious
interested
there
was

some
poor

had
lived
for
weeks

there
were
the
german

captured
during

last

there
were
many
many
reasons
why
travelers
were
drawn
to
major
farm
so
major
turned
his
house
into
a
hotel
one
of
his
dearest
friends
was
madame
villard
she
had
helped
make
life
easier
for
the
major
and
for
his
little
brood
during
the
long
years
following
the
death
of
her
son
the
major
had
tried
to
help
the
stricken
mother
in
her
search
for
her
lost
granddaughter
he
had
at
last
gathered
for
her
the
information
that
on
that
famous
march
an
old
peasant
had
been
seen
with
a
baby
some
one
had
seen
him
but
he
had
fallen
on
the
weary
march
they
knew
that
but
they
did
not
know
about
the
baby
nobody
could
tell
madame
villard
what
had
happened
to
the
baby
the
major
received
madame
villard
letter
poor
madame
he
sighed
as
he
finished
reading
she
does
not
give
up
hope
even
through
all
these
years
and
he
thought
of
the
little
black
figure
which
soon
would
step
from
the
big
glossy
car
she
would
take
what
comfort
this
poor
family
could
provide
she
would
make
happy
the
major
children
with
gifts
and
toys
her
simple
room
would
be
generously
paid
for
then
madame
would
leave
them
and
to
the
cemetery
she
would
go
she
would
visit
it
before
starting
the
journey
homeward
to
paris
and
to
her
little
margot
usually
these
visits
of
madame
villard
occurred
after
a
tour
of
the
country
those
tours
took
her
into
very
many
villages
of

and
always
for
the

purpose
always
for

the
major
and
smiled

kind
she
said

this

important
part
of
her

madame
villard
eyes
were
now
twinkling

guess
what
that
very
important
part
might
be
for
a
young
miss
and

am

do
not

the
major
said

you
admit
that

a
most
important
part
of
any
young
lady
birthday
celebration
yes
laughed
major
very
important
and
serious
then
major
pulled
a
little
card
out
of
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
madame
and
since
mademoiselle
margot
is
to
have
a
beautiful
frock
he
said
why
do
you
not
take
her
to
this
old
friend
of
mine
who
makes
some
of
the
loveliest
frocks
in
paris
madame
villard
read
the
card
and
then
looked
up
at
the
major
questioningly
illustration
verdun
he
continued
suzanne
moreau
lived
in
the
village
adjoining
my
farm
before
that
village
was
destroyed
by
the
enemy
she
was
a
demure
little
dressmaker
and
we
knew
her
my
wife
and
i
as
a
kindly
and
lonely
soul
now
as
you
see
by
this
card
she
has
established
a
fashionable
children
shop
in
your
paris
she
is
still
a
kindly
modest
little
woman
her
whole
life
is
centered
in
that
small
niece
of
hers
jeanne
who
is
called
the
model
have
you
perhaps
heard
of
her
illustration
the
meuse
madame
villard
nodded
and
looked
again
at
the
card
auntie

she
read
yes
indeed
she
answered
i
have
heard
but
margot
and
i
have

hard

friend

chapter
viii
the
guignol
auntie
sue
watched
jeanne
as
she
skipped
along
to
school
there
could
not
possibly
have
been
a
happier
skip
there
could
not
possibly
have
been
a
happier
little
face
than
the
one
auntie
sue
had
just
kissed
but
yet
as
jeanne
turned
the
corner
auntie
sue
felt
something
sad
inside
of
her
something
said
to
her
she
is
not
really
happy
other
children
are
happy
but
jeanne
is
not
a
child
she
is
a
puppet
a
puppet
suzanne
rushed
into
the
shop
and
tried
to
shut
out
those
thoughts
and
jeanne
skipped
along
to
school
strange
to
say
jeanne
was
thinking
of
puppets
too
but
she
was
not
thinking
of
them
in
the
same
way
as
was
auntie
sue
she
was
thinking
of
the
puppet
show
in
the
park
this
puppet
show
is
called
a
guignol
in
france
and
the
park
where
it
is
played
is
the
champs
elysées
on
nearly
every
corner
of
this
beautiful
park
is
a
guignol
where
there
is
no
guignol
there
is
a
swing
or
there
are
donkeys
to
ride
or
goat
carts
children
are
amused
in
paris
illustration
the
guignol
jeanne
often
passed
the
park
but
the
amusements
there
were
not
for
her
jeanne
had
no
time
for
guignols
and
donkeys
and
goat
carts
jeanne
had
to
go
to
school
and
from
school
to
help
auntie
in
the
shop
the
donkeys
and
swings
and
other
amusements
did
not
attract
jeanne
so
much
but
oh
how
she
loved
the
guignol
very
often
she
would
stop
outside
the
tall
gates
and
watch
for
ever
so
short
a
time
and
when
the
children
cried
out
there
he
is
there
he
is
as
they
do
when
the
wicked
policeman
pops
up
his
puppet
head
jeanne
would
shout
with
them
she
loved
those
silly
little
puppets
she
knew
them
all
just
by
passing
them
each
day
there
was
guignol
the
bad
boy
he
was
the
one
all
the
children
loved
there
was
the
policeman
and
how
they
hated
him
there
was
a
funny
lady
with
a
wobbly
hat
which
was
always
knocked
off
and
her
hair
would
all
fall
down
there
were
others
there
was
a
pale
very
pale
boy
they
called
pierrot
which
in
french
means
clown
jeanne
felt
sorry
for
him
because
he
was
very
old
and
paintless
and
torn
they
never
gave
him
a
fresh
coat
of
paint
nor
mended
his
suit
poor
pierrot
jeanne
knew
those
stories
by
heart
too
there
was
the
story
of
the
milkman
the
bad
boy
drinks
all
the
milkman
milk
while
sending
him
on
useless
errands
there
was
the
mattress
the
story
in
which
guignol
has
a
dream
right
up
on
the
tiny
stage
guignol
by
the
way
is
just
like
our
american
punch
a
puppet
of
the
punch
and
judy
show
there
were
a
few
other
stories
but
they
were
always
the
same
jeanne
thought
of
many
new
stories
she
wondered
why
the
children
did
grow
tired
of
having
the
same
stories
all
the
time
jeanne
could
make
up
others
and
she
did
while
she
skipped
to
school
she
made
them
up
while
she
walked
about
the
shop
showing
auntie
little
models
was
a
very
fine
day
when
school
was
over
jeanne
found
a
group
of
children
in
clothes
watching
the
guignol
how
sweet
and
pretty
they
looked
sitting
under
the
trees
in
their
dainty
clothes
jeanne
leaned
against
a
tree
it
was
early
yet
she
might
watch
one
guignol
play
illustration
jeanne
leaned
against
a
tree
the
play
was
the
thief
guignol
gives
a
lady
a
rose
she
puts
it
in
her
hair
under
the
large
floppy
hat
then
guignol
dances
for
her
it
is
a
clumsy
dance
and
he
trips
the
children
laugh
he
gallops
clumsily
off
the
stage
pierrot
tiptoes
in
from
the
other
side
jeanne
leans
forward
eagerly
has
pierrot
a
new
suit
new
paint
no
he
is
shabby
and
pale
ah
poor
pierrot
but
he
dances
on
tiptoes
so
light
is
he
his
dance
is
elfin
and
gay
the
lady
watches
she
is
enchanted
pierrot
flits
about
the
stage
then
when
his
dance
is
at
an
end
he
snatches
the
rose
from
the
lady
hair
the
lady
wobbly
hat
falls
off
the
lady
wobbly
hair
falls
down
she
is
a
sorry
sight
but
who
is
that
entering
on
the
side
it
is
guignol
he
marches
up
to
pierrot
and
there
is
a
fight
the
children
scream
the
children
cry
out
pierrot
is
losing
ah
guignol
guignol
the
children
cry
their
hero
is
winning
pierrot
is
thrown
and
he
lands
far
away
from
the
stage
he
lands
on
the
ground
but
the
children
do
not
mind
they
are
all
absorbed
in
guignol
their
guignol
he
is
kissing
the
lady
now
but
not
for
long
are
they
happy
the
alligator
comes
gliding
upon
the
stage
there
is
another
battle
and
guignol
vanquishes
the
alligator
then
indeed
is
guignol
a
hero
the
curtain
falls
to
the
pleased
applause
of
the
young
audience
only
jeanne
has
noticed
pierrot
he
lies
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
nobody
has
come
to
fetch
him
time
goes
on
and
as
the
sun
sinks
lower
more
and
more
children
leave
the
park
the
guignol
plays
are
over
for
the
day
the
men
who
make
them
are
packing
to
go
now
everyone
is
gone
but
jeanne
jeanne
and
the
pierrot
are
alone
the
little
girl
goes
up
to
the
puppet
they
have
forgotten
you
pierrot
she
says
softly
but
maybe
they
do
not
care
then
jeanne
sits
down
on
a
bench
with
pierrot
in
her
arms
but
come
come
you
must
not
mind
pierrot
if
they
do
not
love
you
you
must
not
mind
if
they
throw
you
aside
and
clap
for
guignol
see
i
love
you
very
much
and
even
if
you
do
wear
shabby
clothes
and
your
paint
is
dull
that
does
not
matter
jeanne
rocks
the
pierrot
it
grows
dark
in
the
champs
elysées
you
must
not
mind
see
pierrot
she
says
see
my
dress
and
coat
and
cap
they
are
as
shabby
as
yours
but
i
do
not
mind
you
see
we
are
both
the
same
but
i
feel
sorry
because
you
do
not
dance
more
and
because
you
are
never
the
hero
of
the
plays
guignol
is
an
awkward
clumsy
fellow
it
is
you
who
are
my
hero
pierrot
as
she
talks
jeanne
voice
grows
soft
and
drowsy
jeanne
head
nods
and
her
eyes
close
a
soft
breeze
begins
to
stir
in
the
trees
jeanne
is
asleep
chapter
ix
an
adventure
in
the
bois
jeanne
and
pierrot
were
walking
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
dẽ
that
is
a
beautiful
wood
in
paris
where
children
and
grown
people
play
and
walk
and
go
boating
on
silvery
lakes
illustration
the
bois
de
boulogne
jeanne
and
pierrot
walked
in
the
bois
bwä
hand
in
hand
pierrot
was
not
crying
any
more
though
it
had
taken
jeanne
a
long
time
to
soothe
him
she
told
him
of
the
many
stories
she
would
make
up
she
told
him
of
the
many
fine
adventures
he
would
have
as
the
hero
of
these
stories
jeanne
now
had
a
story
in
her
mind
and
she
was
taking
pierrot
to
a
quiet
spot
where
she
could
tell
him
about
it
sit
here
beside
me
pierrot
she
said
at
last
they
had
found
a
sylvan
dell
that
might
have
been
in
the
heart
of
instead
of
in
the
heart
of
a
big
city
like
paris
now
listen
pierrot
said
jeanne
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
very
fine
story
you
and
i
shall
be
the
actors
in
it
i
shall
be
joan
of
arc
and
you
shall
be
my
knight
you
know
that
joan
of
arc
was
only
a
little
girl
when
she
heard
the
call
to
save
her
country
she
rode
a
big
horse
at
the
head
of
an
army
she
marched
against
the
enemy
with
a
sword
in
her
hand
but
my
story
says
that
without
her
brave
knight
she
could
not
have
won
the
battle
pierrot
shirt
puffed
out
his
little
clown
cap
went
up
in
the
air
puff
and
came
down
again
on
his
head
he
was
very
proud
indeed
jeanne
was
pleased
because
she
had
made
him
happy
now
see
we
shall
begin
our
story
and
i
am
hearing
the
call
jeanne
stood
but
first
she
picked
up
a
long
stick
from
the
ground
the
stick
turned
into
a
sword
a
glittering
sword
jeanne
was
dressed
in
shining
steel
armor
pierrot
tiny
clown
suit
changed
to
a
coat
of
mail
they
were
ready
for
the
battle
forward
my
brave
men
of
france
called
joan
of
arc
and
the
little
puppet
saluted
jeanne
but
jeanne
cried
my
horse
where
is
my
horse
a
large
statue
appeared
before
them
it
was
the
iron
statue
of
a
horse
it
was
twice
the
size
of
a
real
horse
jeanne
tried
to
mount
she
could
not
she
was
too
small
the
horse
was
too
high
but
pierrot
mounted
with
a
graceful
leap
he
was
upon
the
charger
back
then
down
he
flew
and
offered
jeanne
his
hand
up
flew
the
puppet
and
jeanne
flew
with
him
they
sat
upon
the
iron
charger
slowly
he
moved
his
joints
and
then
off
off
he
galloped
with
the
little
girl
and
the
puppet
all
the
time
jeanne
was
brandishing
her
sword
she
was
joan
of
arc
and
she
was
riding
at
the
head
of
her
army
of
france
as
joan
of
arc
had
done
long
long
ago
wait
wait
called
a
voice
a
policeman
was
running
after
them
through
the
bois
stop
you
have
stolen
a
statue
from
the
park
bring
back
the
iron
horse
he
was
so
little
that
policeman
and
the
horse
was
so
big
that
they
did
not
mind
him
he
is
only
a
policeman
said
jeanne
to
pierrot
he
is
always
clubbed
and
kicked
in
the
guignol
plays
pierrot
laughed
and
pop
part
of
his
armor
burst
oh
he
is
a
wicked
wicked
policeman
said
jeanne
the
children
always
hate
him
in
the
guignol
plays
so
away
from
the
policeman
they
galloped
but
wait
look
the
policeman
has
grown
and
he
is
now
as
tall
as
the
horse
the
club
he
carries
has
grown
too
and
he
clubs
the
iron
horse
it
makes
a
terrible
noise
and
the
horse
stops
knock
knock
knock
wake
up
little
one
says
a
gruff
voice
jeanne
opens
her
eyes
and
looks
into
the
face
of
a
policeman
standing
over
her
in
the
park
she
has
been
asleep
on
the
bench
with
the
little
puppet
pierrot
in
her
arms
it
is
very
dark
in
the
park
it
is
night
come
says
the
policeman
tell
me
where
you
live
little
one
oh
the
terrible
policeman
of
the
guignol
plays
jeanne
remembers
how
the
children
hate
him
and
she
tries
to
run
away
but
the
policeman
catches
hold
of
her
arm
it
seems
to
jeanne
that
his
face
is
kind
come
little
one
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
i
am
the
friend
of
the
children
tell
me
where
you
live
and
let
me
take
you
home
he
says
it
was
very
dark
in
the
park
but
as
they
walked
through
the
city
streets
the
lights
made
everything
as
bright
as
day
jeanne
and
the
policeman
and
pierrot
came
to
the
door
of
auntie
shop
when
the
policeman
handed
jeanne
to
auntie
sue
the
little
girl
could
not
help
wondering
why
the
children
hate
the
policeman
in
the
guignol
plays
oh
jeanne
my
little
one
ma
chérie
where
have
you
been
cried
auntie
sue
it
was
quite
evident
that
poor
auntie
sue
had
been
worried
she
caught
the
little
dreamer
and
the
puppet
into
her
arms
she
hugged
them
so
tightly
that
jeanne
thought
they
would
both
be
crushed
jeanne
was
more
concerned
about
pierrot
than
about
herself
though
for
he
was
so
little
and
frail
then
auntie
put
jeanne
to
bed
with
pierrot
beside
her
his
face
peering
out
from
the
covers
and
when
auntie
had
left
them
alone
jeanne
whispered
to
her
little
puppet
friend
pierrot
the
policeman
shall
not
be
bad
in
our
stories
he
is
good
you
see
in
our
stories
you
shall
be
the
hero
the
policeman
shall
be
a
kind
man
who
loves
children
guignol
shall
be
the
wicked
one
and
you
shall
kick
and
beat
him
pierrot
did
not
move
jeanne
was
awake
now
you
see
and
puppets
do
not
move
by
themselves
when
children
are
awake
but
jeanne
thought
she
saw
his
eyes
twinkle
and
his
nose
wriggle
just
the
least
bit
before
she
popped
off
to
sleep
chapter
x
the
live
puppet
after
auntie
left
jeanne
and
the
pierrot
asleep
in
bed
that
night
she
went
into
her
own
room
and
sat
down
by
her
little
table
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hands
and
thought
very
hard
poor
auntie
sue
was
unhappy
there
was
a
little
voice
inside
of
her
that
never
would
be
still
this
voice
talked
and
talked
and
talked
no
one
could
hear
it
but
auntie
sue
it
was
not
a
person
nor
was
it
a
fairy
yet
it
was
there
and
it
talked
to
auntie
sue
people
call
that
voice
conscience
you
see
many
other
people
beside
auntie
sue
have
heard
that
voice
he
is
known
to
everyone
who
does
wrong
and
auntie
sue
had
done
great
wrong
not
knowing
it
she
had
been
doing
a
great
wrong
all
these
years
she
had
kept
jeanne
from
her
rightful
home
and
now
that
voice
called
conscience
was
tormenting
her
he
was
talking
more
loudly
and
more
fiercely
than
he
had
ever
talked
before
as
auntie
sue
sat
before
her
little
table
he
did
not
leave
her
a
moment
peace
illustration
jeanne
showing
a
new
frock
you
see
what
has
happened
he
said
inside
of
auntie
sue
you
see
what
you
have
done
by
keeping
jeanne
from
madame
villard
she
is
starved
for
play
you
have
made
her
a
poor
little
girl
who
has
to
work
if
she
lived
in
the
lovely
apartment
house
with
her
grandmother
she
could
play
and
play
and
play
suzanne
clapped
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
stop
the
voice
but
conscience
came
from
her
heart
and
did
not
need
her
ears
to
hear
him
he
went
right
on
what
would
that
soldier
say
what
would
the
old
man
say
what
would
the
grandmother
say
and
major
oh
major
my
good
my
honest
friend
sobbed
suzanne
she
thought
of
her
only
friend
in
all
the
world
she
would
never
dare
to
confess
to
him
what
she
had
done
she
opened
her
drawer
and
looked
at
the
picture
in
the
locket
she
read
again
the
name
and
address
which
had
been
pinned
to
the
baby
skirt
so
many
years
ago
madame
villard
avenue
champs
elysées
illustration
she
read
again
the
name
and
address
the
face
of
jeanne
father
looked
back
at
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
eyes
were
accusing
her
you
have
kept
her
from
her
rightful
home
and
from
the
pleasures
of
childhood
went
on
the
voice
and
the
face
in
the
locket
seemed
to
agree
with
the
voice
the
child
stayed
in
the
park
with
a
puppet
the
only
play
toy
she
has
ever
had
she
fell
asleep
in
front
of
the
guignol
where
happy
children
go
to
clap
and
laugh
but
you
give
jeanne
no
time
for
play
and
laughter
it
was
all
true
but
suzanne
knew
that
if
jeanne
stopped
showing
the
clothes
she
made
her
audience
would
cease
to
be
interested
if
she
did
not
draw
her
audience
she
could
not
sell
the
clothes
and
if
she
did
not
sell
the
clothes
she
could
not
support
jeanne
it
was
all
quite
terrible
for
auntie
sue
and
she
dared
not
mention
it
to
a
soul
nobody
knew
that
jeanne
did
not
belong
to
her
nobody
knew
jeanne
story
not
even
the
major
chapter
xi
little
spoiled
margot
grandmother
grandmother
home
again
how
glad
i
am
little
margot
threw
herself
into
madame
villard
arms
and
the
old
lady
hugged
her
close
yes
my
little
margot
grandmother
comes
back
for
one
splendid
occasion
ah
my
birthday
smiled
margot
and
then
grandmother
and
margot
planned
for
that
birthday
it
was
strange
how
margot
did
not
like
so
many
things
when
grandmother
mentioned
a
theater
party
the
little
girl
shook
her
dark
head
no
it
is
not
what
i
like
she
said
then
grandmother
suggested
a
trip
to
the
zoo
with
a
party
of
girls
and
boys
no
i
do
not
like
the
zoo
margot
pouted
a
guignol
party
chérie
asked
grandmother
ah
no
they
are
so
stupid
complained
margot
and
grandmother
smiled
and
shook
her
head
my
margot
is
a
little
bit
spoiled
perhaps
she
observed
margot
was
not
a
little
bit
but
a
great
big
bit
spoiled
grandmother
and
mother
had
both
spoiled
her
from
the
day
she
was
born
mother
was
nearly
always
with
father
and
margot
saw
little
of
her
when
they
were
together
mother
would
kiss
and
hug
a
great
deal
and
sometimes
she
would
cry
there
were
always
gifts
in
mother
room
for
margot
and
when
mother
brought
her
into
father
room
he
too
would
pet
and
caress
her
and
give
her
toys
or
candy
poor
helpless
father
he
loved
to
see
his
little
girl
it
made
his
dull
eyes
brighten
when
she
came
into
the
room
he
would
say
to
mother
after
margot
had
left
has
the
sun
gone
under
a
cloud
marie
it
seems
darker
to
me
you
see
he
felt
sunshine
while
his
little
daughter
was
there
but
the
nurse
would
not
allow
frequent
visits
ah
father
might
never
be
allowed
to
forget
that
bitter
war
so
grandmother
played
guardian
to
margot
and
a
loving
and
indulgent
guardian
was
she
margot
could
play
from
morning
until
night
if
she
wanted
to
except
of
course
for
school
hours
the
nursery
was
filled
with
costly
toys
they
did
not
interest
little
margot
any
more
there
were
so
many
of
them
in
fact
little
spoiled
margot
was
not
interested
in
anything
because
she
had
too
much
ah
well
chérie
said
grandmother
you
will
think
of
something
that
grandmother
can
do
for
your
birthday
but
we
shall
go
to
buy
the
little
party
frock
which
i
promised
you
frocks
were
of
no
more
interest
to
margot
than
toys
she
had
too
many
of
those
also
so
she
hardly
listened
to
grandmother
last
remark
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
shop
where
a
little
girl
shows
clothes
to
the
people
who
come
to
buy
a
real
little
model
you
might
call
her
a
live
puppet
my
chérie
will
enjoy
that
will
she
not
asked
grandmother
eagerly
hoping
to
interest
the
child
in
a
new
pleasure
evidently
the
idea
did
bring
with
it
something
new
and
exciting
to
margot
for
she
turned
and
asked
and
does
this
little
girl
really
walk
about
and
pose
as
people
do
on
the
stage
yes
chérie
so
i
hear
answered
madame
villard
a
live
puppet
margot
clapped
her
hands
and
grandmother
was
pleased
to
see
her
joy
then
her
face
fell
she
turned
to
grandmother
and
said
slowly
oh
what
a
lucky
little
girl
she
is
chapter
xii
at
auntie
sue
shop
the
people
are
waiting
hurry
jeanne
called
auntie
to
the
little
girl
at
the
back
of
the
screen
jeanne
sat
with
pierrot
before
her
and
both
were
dressed
in
splendor
the
little
girl
had
on
a
new
frock
of
auntie
sue
her
dark
hair
made
a
charming
frame
for
her
little
oval
face
under
the
yellow
poke
bonnet
of
shape
she
wore
an
dress
it
was
yellow
with
flowers
and
a
velvet
bow
and
pierrot
ah
pierrot
too
was
fine
in
a
new
satin
suit
and
cap
with
bright
red
cheeks
which
jeanne
had
painted
many
exciting
adventures
were
happening
there
behind
the
screen
to
the
little
girl
and
the
clown
in
satin
jeanne
was
not
thinking
of
this
new
frock
of
auntie
which
she
wore
nor
of
the
big
saturday
audience
out
in
the
shop
waiting
for
her
to
appear
she
was
thinking
of
her
latest
play
for
pierrot
as
auntie
called
jeanne
put
the
puppet
down
and
smoothing
the
dainty
dress
she
stepped
out
into
the
bright
little
shop
room
all
about
were
seated
ladies
and
children
the
children
were
in
smart
attire
with
interested
and
curious
little
faces
that
peered
and
stared
at
the
live
puppet
as
she
walked
about
as
jeanne
passed
a
little
girl
with
hair
and
eyes
as
dark
as
her
own
and
a
wistful
look
the
lady
sitting
beside
the
little
girl
stopped
jeanne
what
a
beautiful
frock
she
said
and
touched
the
hem
of
the
garment
gently
illustration
what
a
beautiful
frock
she
said
jeanne
and
the
little
girl
looked
at
each
other
auntie
sue
came
over
to
them
madame
villard
smiled
at
the
dressmaker
and
asked
do
you
think
that
this
style
would
become
my
little
granddaughter
suzanne
looked
quickly
at
margot
margot
big
brown
eyes
were
fastened
eagerly
upon
the
child
whom
she
had
called
a
lucky
little
girl
yes
madame
answered
auntie
sue
with
her
brown
eyes
and
slight
figure
the
little
mademoiselle
should
wear
the
frock
as
well
as
jeanne
does
madame
and
auntie
sue
then
talked
for
some
time
about
the
frock
jeanne
went
about
the
large
audience
with
margot
wondering
eyes
following
her
every
movement
at
last
jeanne
finished
showing
all
the
garments
the
young
model
disappeared
behind
the
screen
and
the
audience
began
to
leave
auntie
sue
was
showing
a
closet
full
of
clothes
to
madame
villard
whose
many
purchases
made
the
pencil
of
auntie
sue
skip
over
the
page
and
her
heart
skip
with
gladness
this
was
of
course
dull
for
margot
and
margot
was
not
used
to
things
being
dull
she
sat
in
the
empty
room
while
grandmother
talked
and
looked
at
clothes
and
paid
no
attention
to
her
the
little
girl
began
to
walk
about
the
shop
she
peered
at
the
floppy
dolls
on
the
tables
and
at
the
quaint
hat
stands
and
she
came
to
the
screen
behind
which
jeanne
had
disappeared
she
longed
to
peep
behind
that
screen
she
edged
up
close
and
tried
to
look
through
the
cracks
to
the
back
she
heard
a
tiny
sound
then
words
down
with
the
bastille
margot
pressed
her
head
against
the
screen
to
hear
better
the
screen
began
to
topple
over
it
went
there
was
a
muffled
sound
and
jeanne
stood
up
and
faced
margot
jeanne
was
now
in
her
own
simple
clothes
she
held
the
pierrot
puppet
who
was
however
still
grandly
dressed
she
stared
hard
at
margot
and
then
at
the
fallen
screen
margot
stared
too
then
margot
managed
to
remember
her
manners
excuse
me
she
said
i
did
not
mean
to
knock
down
the
screen
jeanne
smiled
and
picked
up
the
screen
while
margot
helped
her
set
it
in
place
when
it
again
stood
erect
margot
found
herself
outside
and
jeanne
inside
they
were
separated
as
before
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
from
both
sides
of
the
screen
then
came
a
giggle
from
one
side
and
a
giggle
from
the
other
and
then
from
the
outside
may
i
come
back
and
see
you
from
the
inside
yes
do
come
margot
went
behind
the
screen
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
learned
the
magic
of
real
play
jeanne
had
one
plaything
a
little
forsaken
puppet
but
with
love
and
tenderness
she
made
him
a
hero
jeanne
told
margot
about
pierrot
she
told
that
he
was
no
longer
the
buffoon
the
poor
mistreated
clown
he
was
now
a
hero
he
could
play
a
knight
or
a
king
napoleon
she
told
margot
that
pierrot
was
napoleon
in
one
of
her
plays
and
that
she
was
joan
of
arc
margot
lived
in
another
world
for
the
space
of
an
hour
then
the
two
little
girls
were
called
back
suddenly
by
a
voice
from
the
room
margot
margot
child
where
are
you
grandmother
was
looking
for
her
margot
and
jeanne
stepped
out
from
behind
the
screen
and
found
grandmother
preparing
to
leave
auntie
sue
stood
beside
her
with
pencil
and
pad
thank
you
madame
said
auntie
sue
gratefully
for
your
splendid
order
it
was
indeed
kind
of
you
to
make
so
many
purchases
at
my
little
shop
madame
answered
i
am
truly
pleased
with
your
charming
wares
my
dear
mademoiselle
moreau
besides
you
know
my
dear
friend
major
is
also
a
friend
of
yours
but
madame
said
auntie
sue
as
the
grandmother
and
her
little
margot
started
out
of
the
door
i
have
not
yet
taken
your
name
i
do
not
know
of
course
of
course
laughed
madame
villard
how
very
forgetful
of
me
please
write
my
name
and
address
so
you
will
know
where
to
send
the
little
things
suzanne
seated
herself
at
a
tiny
desk
and
with
pencil
poised
looked
up
at
the
sweet
face
above
her
madame
dictated
madame
paul
villard
avenue
champs
elysées
the
pencil
dropped
from
auntie
sue
hand
her
head
fell
forward
jeanne
rushed
over
to
the
little
desk
and
caught
auntie
sue
as
she
was
about
to
fall
auntie
auntie
dear
what
is
the
matter
she
cried
little
margot
picked
up
the
pencil
while
both
children
and
madame
villard
hovered
over
the
desk
suzanne
rested
her
head
on
her
hand
and
whispered
it
is
all
right
i
am
all
right
now
i
was
only
a
bit
faint
oh
i
am
so
sorry
dear
madame
illustration
it
is
all
right
i
am
all
right
now
auntie
sue
was
soon
up
upon
her
sprightly
little
feet
again
smilingly
she
bowed
madame
and
her
granddaughter
out
of
the
door
but
when
they
had
left
the
shop
suzanne
went
to
her
room
and
jeanne
did
not
see
her
again
that
day
chapter
xiii
come
and
play
margot
took
off
the
telephone
receiver
and
asked
for
a
number
it
was
early
next
morning
and
the
child
was
not
yet
dressed
she
was
in
kimono
and
slippers
and
had
tiptoed
into
the
living
room
hello
said
a
voice
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
hello
said
margot
i
want
to
speak
with
jeanne
if
you
please
margot
had
talked
of
nothing
but
jeanne
from
the
time
she
had
left
the
shop
she
had
fallen
asleep
last
night
to
the
tune
of
pierrot
dreams
fiery
steeds
and
gallant
armored
knights
grandmother
promised
that
she
might
ask
jeanne
to
play
with
her
they
would
go
for
a
long
drive
they
would
go
to
the
park
and
to
the
guignol
there
was
nobody
like
jeanne
nobody
that
margot
had
ever
met
is
this
jeanne
asked
margot
as
the
little
girl
voice
came
over
the
telephone
yes
this
is
margot
can
you
go
out
with
me
i
shall
call
for
you
at
two
it
was
a
command
but
little
margot
was
not
aware
of
that
she
did
not
mean
it
that
way
she
only
meant
to
have
what
she
wanted
as
she
usually
did
but
i
must
first
ask
auntie
jeanne
replied
oh
she
will
let
you
go
declared
margot
you
may
tell
her
that
we
shall
take
care
of
you
and
bring
you
back
safely
margot
waited
while
jeanne
ran
to
auntie
room
jeanne
had
not
seen
auntie
since
the
afternoon
before
when
she
had
so
mysteriously
disappeared
in
her
room
after
her
fainting
spell
jeanne
found
auntie
a
pale
and
worried
auntie
this
morning
oh
auntie
dear
cried
jeanne
throwing
her
arms
about
suzanne
neck
you
are
not
well
suzanne
assured
the
child
that
she
was
quite
well
and
so
she
was
the
only
trouble
was
with
the
little
man
who
is
nothing
but
a
voice
and
is
called
conscience
he
had
been
talking
to
her
all
night
and
keeping
her
awake
when
jeanne
told
what
madame
villard
grandchild
wanted
it
seemed
that
suzanne
flinched
at
the
name
but
she
smiled
and
answered
yes
dear
tell
her
you
will
go
it
will
be
so
nice
for
you
and
is
sunday
there
is
no
work
jeanne
was
only
a
child
and
she
longed
to
go
with
her
new
little
friend
she
longed
to
ride
in
the
big
motor
and
to
play
but
she
hesitated
just
for
a
minute
you
are
sure
you
will
not
need
me
dear
auntie
she
asked
run
along
and
tell
the
little
girl
you
are
coming
laughed
auntie
sue
when
jeanne
closed
the
door
behind
her
suzanne
moreau
smile
faded
she
held
her
throbbing
head
in
her
two
hands
how
she
longed
to
tell
some
one
of
her
sufferings
if
only
she
dared
confide
her
story
to
the
major
but
she
valued
that
honorable
gentleman
friendship
so
much
that
she
feared
to
lose
it
by
admitting
what
she
now
felt
to
be
her
terrible
crime
conscience
was
making
her
think
that
conscience
together
with
the
face
in
the
locket
and
now
jeanne
was
going
out
with
little
margot
her
own
cousin
margot
would
take
her
in
a
beautiful
car
margot
would
wear
beautiful
clothes
they
would
play
with
beautiful
toys
ah
poor
little
jeanne
it
was
hard
for
suzanne
with
these
thoughts
to
keep
a
smiling
face
until
jeanne
had
left
with
margot
chapter
xiv
a
drive
through
paris
through
paris
in
a
fine
motor
car
how
often
jeanne
had
seen
these
same
sights
but
now
how
splendid
it
all
seemed
to
the
little
girl
as
she
sat
beside
margot
with
pierrot
firmly
clasped
in

their
happy
day
the
little
girls
drove
to
the
park
they
sat
upon
a
bench
beneath
shady
trees
and
they
watched
a
guignol
play
they
had
chatted
and
laughed
and
now
were
the
very
best
of
friends
margot
was
a
happy
little
girl
that
day
she
had
learned
from
jeanne
how
to
play
sit
still
pierrot
scolded
jeanne
softly
so
that
only
margot
might
hear
pierrot
you
shall
never
come
again
if
you
do
not
behave
continued
jeanne
margot
was
laughing
for
she
could
see
pierrot
bouncing
up
and
down
on
the
bench
of
course
the
other
children
could
see
it
but
jeanne
told
margot
about
it
so
she
could
see
plainly
what
this
naughty
puppet
was
doing
oh
dear
whispered
jeanne
to
margot
he
will
do
something
dreadful
when
guignol
comes
on
the
stage
you
know
he
can
not
bear
guignol
there
now
was
an
ugly
clown
in
the
play
he
had
taken
pierrot
place
after
that
day
when
poor
pierrot
had
been
abandoned
here
comes
guignol
exclaimed
margot
guignol
slid
upon
the
stage
and
fell
flop
on
his
nose
guignol
began
to
dance
but
again
he
tripped
over
his
big
feet
and
landed
puff
on
his
stomach
he
stood
up
grunting
and
groaning
and
puffing
and
again
he
danced
margot
and
jeanne
watched
pierrot
bouncing
up
and
down
jeanne
had
to
catch
pierrot
hat
each
time
it
flew
off
as
it
did
whenever
guignol
fell
down
on
the
stage
pierrot
hair
stood
up
like
wire
and
the
cap
went
up
in
the
air
at
least
that
is
what
jeanne
said
it
did
when
the
fight
came
they
could
not
hold
pierrot
he
kicked
and
squirmed
and
waved
his
arms
jeanne
was
so
shocked
when
his
cap
flew
off
and
hit
a
gentleman
in
the
eye
margot
was
embarrassed
too
they
scolded
and
spanked
pierrot
but
it
did
no
good
he
wants
to
be
in
the
play
whispered
jeanne
i
have
spoiled
him
by
making
him
the
hero
and
now
he
can
not
watch
guignol
the
children
were
relieved
when
at
last
the
play
was
over
they
were
then
able
to
take
the
unruly
puppet
away
and
bundle
him
into
the
car
my
child
always
disgraces
me
but
we
can
not
blame
him
said
jeanne
shaking
her
head
like
a
fond
but
troubled
mother
he
was
so
abused
before
and
now
he
has
discovered
what
a
great
actor
he
is
and
what
a
hero
oh
but
pierrot
is
splendid
answered
margot
and
pop
went
a
button
on
pierrot
suit
his
chest
puffed
out
and
his
hat
flew
off
the
children
laughed

jeanne
and
margot
played
in
the
champs
elysées
when
margot
left
jeanne
at
the
door
of
auntie
sue
shop
she
wanted
to
know
when
they
should
be
together
again
she
asked
when
they
should
play
more
of
jeanne
stories
with
pierrot
jeanne
did
not
tell
margot
that
she
would
not
be
able
to
play
again
for
many
days
work
would
interfere
work
was
always
there
to
stop
play
but
jeanne
did
not
say
this
to
margot
margot
would
not
have
understood
jeanne
only
told
her
that
she
hoped
they
would
meet
soon
again
so
with
her
puppet
in
her
arms
she
stepped
out
of
the
car
she
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
out
of
a
different
world
from
her
own
and
margot
planned
all
the
way
home
to
repeat
pleasures
and
and

jeanne
and
margot
margot
and
again
with
jeanne
did
not
come
to
pass
margot
discovered
she
could
not
disturb
the
little
girl
workaday
life
it
greatly
annoyed
margot
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
could
not
wave
her
wand
and
command
what
she
wished
i
want
her
i
want
to
play
with
her
exclaimed
the
pouting
margot
stamping
her
foot
she
had
just
called
jeanne
on
the
telephone
jeanne
had
told
her
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
to
the
guignol
or
play
was
a
week
day
and
from
school
jeanne
was
obliged
to
hurry
home
to
help
auntie
sue
in
the
shop
come
margot
child
pleaded
grandmother
do
not
fret
we
shall
take
another
child
grandmother
will
telephone
for
you
they
are
all
stupid
i
want
jeanne
insisted
the
little
girl
so
margot
went
to
the
guignol
with
her
nurse
she
went
again
and
again
all
the
time
she
thought
of
the
happy
day
she
had
spent
there
with
jeanne
and
pierrot
while
margot
was
watching
the
puppets
one
day
she
noticed
a
child
standing
outside
the
gate
looking
in
it
was
jeanne
jeanne
was
coming
home
from
school
and
as
she
often
did
was
watching
guignol
antics
for
a
few
brief
moments
margot
jumped
up
and
to
the
astonishment
of
her
nurse
she
ran
over
to
jeanne
jeanne
how
happy
i
am
to
see
you
come
in
come
we
shall
see
the
guignol
together
she
cried
illustration
come
jeanne
we
shall
see
the
guignol
together
but
jeanne
shook
her
head
and
her
eyes
were
sad
i
should
like
to
margot
she
answered
but
auntie
is
waiting
i
must
go
they
stood
there
together
for
several
moments
during
those
moments
margot
caught
once
more
the
spell
of
jeanne
play
magic
for
jeanne
played
always
she
played
while
she
talked
or
dressed
or
walked
and
while
she
watched
the
guignol
her
playing
was
always
splendid
margot
caught
the
spell
long
after
jeanne
had
left
she
sat
and
played
her
own
dream
plays
while
the
play
of
the
guignol
went
on
in
front
of
her
often
after
that
day
margot
saw
jeanne
hurrying
home
but
jeanne
never
stopped
again
jeanne
often
saw
margot
after
that
day
but
she
hardly
turned
her
head
toward
the
park
she
kept
hurrying
on
because
she
was
afraid
of
the
tears
that
lived
just
behind
her
eyes
when
she
passed
the
guignol
those
tears
might
at
any
moment
break
through
the
doors
of
her
eyes
and
margot
must
not
see
that
as
margot
watched
jeanne
she
wondered
whether
after
all
the
little
puppet
was
such
a
lucky
little
girl
she
began
to
think
of
a
really
lucky
little
girl
whose
name
was
margot
one
day
when
margot
came
home
she
said
to
grandmother
grandmother
dear
i
have
at
last
thought
what
you
may
give
me
on
my
birthday
grandmother
took
her
hand
i
am
glad
chérie
she
answered
because
the
day
is
drawing
near
if
i
may
take
jeanne
with
me
to
the
bois
and
spend
the
day
there
that
is
all
i
wish
said
margot
and
no
party
grandmother
looked
surprised
no
i
prefer
that
said
margot
grandmother
telephoned
to
auntie
sue
it
was
arranged
that
jeanne
was
to
be
spared
for
that
one
day
margot
birthday
a
day
in
the
woods
was
planned
with
a
picnic
and
a
boat
ride
but
best
of
all
with
jeanne
and
pierrot
the
morning
of
margot
birthday
arrived
as
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
a
dismal
sight
met
them
the
gray
sky
was
pouring
down
bucketsful
of
rain
the
morning
was
as
gray
and
dark
as
a
rainy
morning
can
be
margot
saw
her
day
in
the
woods
spoiled
and
she
started
to
cry
but
grandmother
arranged
that
jeanne
was
to
come
to
the
apartment
margot
pout
did
not
make
of
her
a
very
happy
looking
birthday
girl
but
she
had
to
be
satisfied
with
these
plans
it
would
have
been
so
nice
to
play
in
the
bois
she
sulked
yes
chérie
said
grandmother
but
we
can
not
change
the
weather
and
so
in
front
of
a
crackling
fire
in
margot
toy
stuffed
nursery
the
two
little
girls
spent
the
day
margot
met
jeanne
with
is
it
too
bad
but
jeanne
could
find
nothing
to
feel
sorry
about
oh
what
a
beautiful
fire
she
exclaimed
and
after
a
little
while
margot
began
to
be
glad
that
the
day
was
rainy
because
jeanne
was
glad
chapter

i

auntie
sue
worked
very
hard
she
now
had
several
large
orders
to
fill
she
was
finishing
madame
villard
order
and
she
hoped
to
bring
the
little
dresses
to
the
apartment
that
evening
jeanne
was
spending
margot
birthday
at
the
villard
apartment
so
suzanne
determined
to
deliver
the
dresses
and
fetch
jeanne
when
the
day
was
over
she
worked
steadily
and
tried
to
banish
thoughts
and
voices
inside
of
her
since
madame
villard
visit
to
the
shop
suzanne
had
not
had
a
moment
peace
from
conscience
it
was
only
the
thought
that
jeanne
really
loved
to
show
the
pretty
clothes
that
kept
suzanne
the
least
bit
happy
she
answered
conscience
thus
but
see
how
happy
the
child
is
when
i
give
her
a
new
frock
to
show
she
knows
too
that
she
is
the
envy
of
every
child
in
paris
and
conscience
always
replied
perhaps
but
maybe
she
is
telling
you
that
maybe
she
is
really
like
any
other
child
who
wants
and
needs
to
play
this
was
the
thing
that
always
caused
auntie
sue
to
shudder
if
she
had
thought
that
jeanne
cared
she
could
never
have
gone
on
asking
her
to
work
she
hoped
that
jeanne
did
not
like
to
play
and
did
not
mind
being
different
from
other
children
always
this
hope
made
auntie
sue
argue
with
the
voice
you
see
auntie
sue
tried
to
believe
that
jeanne
was
glad
to
be

saying
what
a
pity
you
do
not
have
more
time
to
play
at
this
moment
the
doorbell
rang
auntie

was
ushered
into

by
the
villard
maid
auntie

had
come
to
deliver

not
in

the
maid
but
the
children
are
in
the
nursery
would
you
like
to
go
to
them
thus
it
happened
that
auntie
sue
arrived
at
the
nursery
door
in
time
to
hear
the
two
little
girls
discussing
a
serious
question
auntie
sue
did
not
want
to
eavesdrop
she
would
not
have
listened
to
the
children
if
she
could
have
helped
herself
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
auntie
sue
became
rooted
to
the
floor
and
she
could
not
move
for
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
jeanne
voice
saying
oh
margot
i
hate
all
those
silly
clothes
i
hate
being
a
model
i
want
to
be
just
a
little
girl
jeanne
voice
was
bitter
is
it
any
wonder
that
auntie
sue
could
not
move
from
the
spot
on
which
she
was
standing
she
grasped
the
door
knob
to
keep
herself
from
falling
illustration
champagne
vineyards
near

then
the
conversation
went
on
then
why
do
you
do
it
asked
margot
voice
because
came
jeanne
i
dare
not
tell
auntie
she
works
so
hard
and
takes
such
good
care
of
me
you
see
i
have
no
mother
and
father
there
was
silence
and
then
jeanne
voice
went
on
my
papa
was
a
soldier
but
auntie
does
not
know
where
he
fell
again
silence
and
then
margot
said
i
think
your
aunt
would
let
you
play
if
you
would
ask
her
to
no
jeanne
replied
i
would
not
ask
her
i
must
show
the
clothes
she
could
not
sell
them
if
i
did
not
show
them
first
there
was
a
short
silence
and
then
again
came
jeanne
voice
i
just
want
to
be
a
little
girl
i
want
to
play
the
last
word
ended
in
a
sob
for
the
next
few
moments
auntie
sue
did
not
hear
anything
indeed
she
hardly
knew
anything
so
stunned
and
shocked
was
she
auntie

did
not
know
how
it
was
that
she
ever
opened
the
door
she
did
not
know
how
she

came
to
leave

big
and
frightened

why
that
is
auntie

said
madame
a
surprised
note
in
her
voice
she
has
such
a
successful
shop
i
am
told
what
can
be
the
matter
illustration
a
dijon
mustard
shop
that
is
what
i
shall
find
out
soon
answered
the
major
and
he
made
hasty
preparations
to
leave
for
paris
when
major
returned
to
his
farm
two
days
later
he
brought
with
him
a
little
girl
jeanne
was
a
very
little
girl
major
said
i
have
brought
little
jeanne
to
be
our
guest
until
her
aunt
is
better
and
all
the
little
flocked
about
jeanne
and
tried
to
make
her
feel
at
home
it
was
all
so
strange
to
little
jeanne
from
the
city
she
had
been
taken
away
from
auntie
auntie
who
lay
ill
and
needed
her
but
the
major
told
her
to
come
he
told
her
that
auntie
wished
her
to
come
with
him
if
auntie
wished
it
jeanne
must
go
but
otherwise
she
would
never
could
never
have
left
poor
sick
auntie
sue
once
outside
in
the
fresh
pure
country
air
jeanne
began
to
forget
a
little
with
rabbits
and
dogs
and
cats
about
her
and
the
merry
chattering
of
the
major
children
she
could
not
help
it
jeanne
eyes
were
alive
and
her
heart
was
gay
she
was
one
of
the
little
fairies
of
play
and
that
kind
of
fairy
can
not
remain
sad
for
long
besides
the
major
children
had
games
and
playthings
of
which
jeanne
had
never
before
heard
even
pierrot
was
excited
it
was
all
jeanne
could
do
to
hold
him
from
jumping
into
the
little
stream
jeanne
soon
had
the
young
acquainted
with
pierrot
indeed
the
young
fell
quite
in
love
with
sprightly
pierrot
illustration
washing
in
outdoor
water
troughs
in
the
meantime
the
major
recounted
to
his
wife
the
happenings
which
had
befallen
him
in
paris
poor
woman
he
told
madame
as
he
described
plight
she
is
ill
because
of
the
wrong
she
committed
so
many
years
ago
she
could
tell
nobody
about
it
but
she
finally
discovered
that
jeanne
was
unhappy
and
that
was
too
much
for
her
to
bear
she
realized
then
that
she
was
being
punished
for
her
wrong
and
so
she
decided
that
before
it
was
too
late
she
would
confess
so
she
told
you
this
terrible
story
asked
madame
yes
and
asked
me
to
see
madame
villard
replied
the
major
and
when
will
you
break
this
news
to
madame
the
major
wife
inquired
i
have
already
done
so
he
answered
quietly
that
is
i
called
upon
madame
villard
before
leaving
paris
i
told
her
that
i
had
traced
her
lost
grandchild
i
told
her
that
i
wished
her
to
come
to
our
home
but
i
did
not
tell
her
any
more
ah
poor
madame
villard
how
happy
i
am
for
her
what
a
joy
this
will
be
for
her
sighed
madame
the
major
smiled
and
agreed
with
his
wife
and
what
a
joy
for
this
poor
little
child
he
said
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
happy
band
of
children
they
were
romping
and
making
the
air
ring
with
glad
sounds
the
next
morning
jeanne
arose
early
being
on
a
farm
was
something
so
different
and
thrilling
to
this
child
of
the
city
that
every
noise
outside
her
window
seemed
to
call
her
she
put
on
her
little
black
apron
and
went
out
into
the
brisk
country
air
the
farm
animals
greeted
her
and
the
little
stream
gurgled
good
morning
this
was
the
most
beautiful
feeling
that
life
had
ever
given
jeanne
she
skipped
about
the
farm
seeing
and
feeling
and
smelling
the
country
freshness
and
morning
it
was
beautiful
and
then
she
thought
of
auntie
sue
ah
poor
auntie
sue
if
only
she
could
be
here
with
jeanne
if
only
they
could
forget
that
shop
and
come
to
a
place
like
this
why
had
auntie
sue
ever
told
her
about
places
like
this
as
jeanne
thoughts
flew
her
little
feet
flew
too
soon
she
found
herself
walking
along
the
country
road
new
wonders
met
her
eyes
and
ears
and
nose
with
every
step
her
sadness
was
nearly
forgotten
until
she
stopped
there
in
front
of
jeanne
were
countless
crosses
crossed
of
white
crosses
of
brown
all
in
rows
margot
had
told
her
about
the
soldiers
burying
grounds
in
the
argonne
and
in
other
places
of
france
this
was
a
soldiers
burying
ground
illustration
this
was
a
soldiers
burying
ground
the
little
girl
stood
and
wondered
she
wondered
about
her
own
soldier
father
just
then
a
big
motor
car
stopped
not
far
away
and
jeanne
watched
a
lady
and
child
step
out
they
carried
flowers
in
their
arms
they
went
to
a
little
brown
cross
and
they
knelt
the
tears
welled
up
in
jeanne
eyes
ah
how
she
too
needed
to
pray
how
she
needed
a
little
brown
cross
to
kneel
to
to
talk
to
everything
was
making
jeanne
cry
she
was
wondering
again
about
auntie
sue
how
strangely
auntie
had
acted
and
she
had
sent
jeanne
away
chapter

margot
story
come
tell
me
quick
madame
villard
breezed
into
the
major
house
with
margot
following
they
were
both
breathless
excited
what
have
you
found
out
dear
major
tell
me
major
bade
the
eager
grandmother
be
seated
and
rest
herself
then
he
asked
one
of
his
own
little
girls
to
take
margot
outside
we
ca
find
the
little
girl
said
the
major
eldest
to
margot
when
they
were
outside
in
the
garden
when
we
came
out
this
morning
she
was
gone
what
little
girl
asked
margot
why
jeanne
said
the
major
daughter
that
little
girl
from
the
city
papa
brought
her
here
last
night
when
margot
learned
that
it
was
jeanne
auntie
sue
jeanne
the
little
model
she
rushed
into
the
house
oh
grandmother
jeanne
was
here
but
now
she
is
gone
she
cried
the
major
looked
astonished
grandmother
had
been
crying
what
is
that
you
say
my
dear
asked
the
major
she
is
gone
yes
the
children
can
not
find
her
then
the
major
left
grandmother
and
margot
alone
while
he
went
out
to
search
for
jeanne
and
grandmother
held
margot
very
close
while
she
repeated
the
tale
that
the
major
had
just
told
her
and
so
my
dear
little
margot
she
added
jeanne
is
your
own
cousin
margot
could
not
speak
her
heart
was
too
full
she
only
hugged
grandmother
like
a
little
bear
then
more
like
a
swift
jack
rabbit
she
flew
out
of
the
house
she
flew
out
in
search
of
jeanne
her
own
cousin
all
the
were
looking
for
jeanne
but
margot
came
upon
her
first
jeanne
was
kneeling
beside
a
crooked
little
brown
cross
there
were
flowers
on
it
jeanne
had
made
the
crooked
little
brown
cross
herself
and
she
was
praying
she
had
made
it
for
her
soldier
daddy
illustration
jeanne
was
kneeling
beside
a
crooked
little
brown
cross
margot
came
up
behind
jeanne
what
are
you
doing
jeanne
she
asked
jeanne
thought
she
had
never
before
seen
margot
face
this
way
it
seemed
that
margot
was
about
to
cry
but
not
the
usual
margot
cry
she
was
not
acting
spoiled
she
was
not
commanding
anything
she
seemed
so
sweet
and
kind
and
sympathetic
i
i
was
praying
said
jeanne
but
what
are
you
doing
here
margot
margot
sat
down
beside
the
little
figure
and
took
jeanne
hand
i
came
to
play
with
you
jeanne
she
said
i
came
to
tell
you
about
a
new
play
jeanne
could
not
understand
it
at
all
with
head
bent
she
whispered
but
margot
dear
i
have
not
brought
pierrot
we
can
not
play
without
pierrot
margot
answered
we
do
not
need
pierrot
for
this
play
you
see
there
is
only
one
heroine
and
that
is
you
then
margot
told
a
story
to
jeanne
a
curious
story
of
a
little
baby
who
was
kept
away
from
her
grandmother
and
her
cousin
yes
the
baby
was
really
kept
for
a
number
of
years
from
a
home
of
love
and
protection
and
made
to
work
she
had
very
little
time
to
play
she
did
not
even
know
her
real
name
how
could
she
it
had
never
been
told
to
her
illustration
then
margot
told
a
story
to
jeanne
she
told
jeanne
of
another
little
girl
who
lived
in
that
home
and
had
everything
the
other
little
girl
could
have
played
always
but
know
how
she
did
know
how
to
play
until
the
first
little
girl
came
and
showed
her
how
then
margot
told
about
a
kind
man
who
received
a
letter
from
a
sick
lady
telling
what
a
terrible
deed
she
had
done
the
lady
begged
the
kind
man
to
take
the
little
girl
to
his
home
in
the
country
and
then
to
send
for
her
grandmother
and
little
cousin
so
he
did
and
when
the
grandmother
and
little
cousin
arrived
they
found
that
the
child
was
jeanne
jeanne
started
and
her
eyes
grew
big
and
round
margot
put
her
arm
about
jeanne
shoulders
just
then
they
heard
a
step
there
was
grandmother
villard
standing
among
a
group
of
young
grandmother
left
the
group
and
came
over
to
the
two
little
girls
she
took
jeanne
in
her
arms
she
cried

took

in

then
she
said

little
one
my

little
grandchild
the
left
and
jeanne
and
margot
and

sat
together
for
a
long
time
they
sat
silently
but
suddenly
jeanne
exclaimed

auntie

held
her
back
no

said

jeanne
grandmother
arose
the
two
little

knelt
before

in
letters
before
her
she
tried
to
pray
and
to
keep
her
eyes
on
those
words
paul
villard
but
the
letters
ran
together
a
little
breeze
seemed
to
be
whispering
over
and
over
to
her
jeanne
villard
jeanne
villard

your
