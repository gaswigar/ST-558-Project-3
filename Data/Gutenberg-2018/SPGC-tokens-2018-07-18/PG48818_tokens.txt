preface
those
who
have
read
gloria
will
it
is
hoped
hail
with
pleasure
another
work
by
the
same
writer
perez
gald칩s
different
it
is
true
but
in
its
way
not
less
delightful
the
humor
and
tragedy
of
gloria
are
not
to
be
found
in
marianela
the
characters
are
distinct
and
crisply
sketched
but
with
a
tender
hand
the
catastrophe
is
pitiable
rather
shocking
the
whole
tone
is
idyllic
i
have
not
hesitated
to
translate
literally
the
spanish
words
of
endearment
for
though
they
are
foreign
to
the
calmer
spirit
of
our
northern
tongue
they
are
too
characteristic
to
be
lost
and
they
are
strangely
pathetic
as
the
only
outlet
found
for
the
imprisoned
spirit
of
the
hapless
little

marianela
chapter
i
gone
astray
the
sun
had
set
after
the
brief
interval
of
twilight
the
night
fell
calm
and
dark
and
in
its
gloomy
bosom
the
last
sounds
of
a
sleepy
world
died
gently
away
the
traveller
went
forward
on
his
way
hastening
his
step
as
night
came
on
the
path
he
followed
was
narrow
and
worn
by
the
constant
tread
of
men
and
beasts
and
led
gently
up
a
hill
on
whose
verdant
slopes
grew
picturesque
clumps
of
wild
cherry
trees
beeches
and
the
reader
perceives
that
we
are
in
the
north
of
spain
our
traveller
was
a
man
of
middle
age
strongly
built
tall
and
his
movements
were
brisk
and
resolute
his
step
firm
his
manner
somewhat
rugged
his
eye
bold
and
bright
his
pace
was
nimble
considering
that
he
was
decidedly
stout
and
he
was
the
reader
may
at
once
be
told
though
somewhat
prematurely
as
good
a
soul
as
you
may
meet
with
anywhere
he
was
dressed
as
a
man
in
easy
circumstances
should
be
dressed
for
a
journey
in
spring
weather
with
one
of
those
round
shady
hats
which
from
their
ugly
shape
have
been
nicknamed
mushrooms
a
pair
of
hanging
to
a
strap
and
a
knotted
stick
which
when
he
did
not
use
it
to
support
his
steps
served
to
push
aside
the
brambles
when
they
flung
their
thorny
branches
across
so
as
to
catch
his
dress
he
presently
stopped
and
gazing
round
the
dim
horizon
he
seemed
vexed
and
puzzled
he
evidently
was
not
sure
of
his
way
and
was
looking
round
for
some
passing
native
of
the
district
who
might
give
him
such
topographical
information
as
might
enable
him
to
reach
his
destination
i
can
not
be
mistaken
he
said
to
himself
they
told
me
to
cross
the
river
by
the
and
i
did
so
then
to
walk
on
straight
on
and
there
to
my
right
i
do
in
fact
see
that
detestable
town
which
i
should
call
by
reason
of
the
enormous
amount
of
mud
that
chokes
the
well
then
i
can
but
go
straight
on
i
rather
like
the
phrase
and
if
i
bore
arms
i
would
adopt
it
for
my
motto
in
order
to
find
myself
at
last
at
the
famous
mines
of
socartes
but
before
he
had
gone
much
farther
he
added
i
have
lost
my
way
beyond
a
doubt
i
have
lost
my
this
teodoro
golfin
is
the
result
of
your
straight
on
bah
these
blockheads
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
words
either
they
meant
to
laugh
at
you
or
else
they
did
not
know
the
way
to
the
mines
of
socartes
a
huge
mining
establishment
must
be
evident
to
the
senses
with
its
buildings
and
chimneys
its
noise
of
hammers
and
snorting
of
furnaces
neighing
of
horses
and
clattering
of
machinery
and
i
neither
see
nor
hear
nor
smell
anything
i
might
be
in
a
desert
how
absolutely
solitary
if
i
believed
in
witches
i
could
fancy
that
fate
intended
me
this
night
to
have
the
honor
of
making
acquaintance
with
some
deuce
take
it
why
is
there
no
one
to
be
seen
in
these
parts
and
it
will
be
half
an
hour
yet
before
the
moon
rises
ah
treacherous
luna
it
is
you
who
are
to
blame
for
my
if
only
i
could
see
what
sort
of
place
i
am
however
what
could
i
expect
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
the
air
of
a
vigorous
man
who
scorns
danger
what
golfin
after
having
wandered
all
round
the
world
are
you
going
to
give
in
now
the
peasants
were
right
after
all
straight
on
the
universal
law
of
locomotion
can
not
fail
me
here
and
he
bravely
set
out
to
test
the
law
and
went
on
about
a
kilometre
farther
following
the
paths
which
seemed
to
start
from
under
his
feet
crossing
each
other
and
breaking
off
at
a
short
distance
in
a
thousand
angles
which
puzzled
and
tired
him
stout
as
his
resolution
was
at
last
he
grew
weary
of
his
vain
efforts
the
paths
which
had
at
first
all
led
upwards
began
to
slope
downwards
as
they
crossed
each
other
and
at
last
he
came
to
so
steep
a
slope
that
he
could
only
hope
to
get
to
the
bottom
by
rolling
down
it
a
pretty
state
of
things
he
exclaimed
trying
to
console
himself
for
this
provoking
situation
by
his
sense
of
the
ridiculous
where
have
you
got
to
now
my
friend
this
is
a
perfect
abyss
is
anything
to
be
seen
at
the
bottom
no
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
has
disappeared
the
earth
has
been
dug
away
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
but
stones
and
barren
soil
tinged
red
with
iron
i
have
reached
the
mines
no
doubt
of
that
and
yet
there
is
not
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
no
smoky
chimneys
no
noise
not
a
train
in
the
distance
not
even
a
dog
barking
what
am
i
to
do
out
there
the
path
seems
to
slope
up
shall
i
follow
that
shall
i
leave
the
beaten
track
shall
i
go
back
again
oh
this
is
absurd
either
i
am
not
myself
or
i
will
reach
socartes
and
be
welcomed
by
my
worthy
brother
straight
on
he
took
a
step
and
his
foot
sank
in
the
soft
and
crumbling
soil
what
next
ye
ruling
stars
am
i
to
be
swallowed
up
alive
if
only
that
lazy
moon
would
favor
us
with
a
little
light
we
might
see
each
other
faces
and
upon
my
soul
i
can
hardly
expect
to
find
paradise
at
the
bottom
of
this
hole
it
seems
to
be
the
crater
of
some
extinct
volcano
nothing
could
be
easier
than
a
slide
down
this
beautiful
precipice
what
have
we
here
a
stone
capital
a
good
seat
while
i
smoke
a
cigar
and
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
the
philosophical
golfin
seated
himself
as
calmly
as
if
it
were
a
bench
by
a
promenade
and
was
preparing
for
his
smoke
when
he
heard
a
voice
yes
beyond
a
doubt
a
human
voice
at
some
little
distance
a
plaintive
air
or
to
speak
more
accurately
a
melancholy
chant
of
a
single
phrase
of
which
the
last
cadence
was
prolonged
into
a
dying
fall
and
which
at
last
sank
into
the
silence
of
the
night
so
softly
that
the
ear
could
not
detect
when
it
ceased
come
said
the
listener
well
pleased
there
are
some
human
beings
about
that
was
a
girl
voice
yes
certainly
a
girl
and
a
lovely
voice
too
i
like
the
popular
airs
of
this
now
it
has
stopped
hark
it
will
soon
begin
again
yes
i
hear
it
once
more
what
a
beautiful
voice
and
what
a
pathetic
air
you
might
believe
that
it
rose
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
and
that
se침or
golfin
the
most
and
least
superstitious
man
in
this
world
was
going
to
make
acquaintance
with
sylphs
nymphs
gnomes
dryads
and
all
the
rabble
rout
that
obey
the
mysterious
spirit
of
the
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
voice
is
going
farther
away
the
fair
singer
is
departing
hi
girl
child
stop
wait
a
minute
the
voice
which
had
for
a
few
minutes
so
charmed
the
lost
wanderer
with
its
enchanting
strains
was
dying
away
in
the
dark
void
and
at
the
shouts
of
golfin
it
was
suddenly
silent
beyond
a
doubt
the
mysterious
gnome
who
was
solacing
its
underground
loneliness
by
singing
its
plaintive
loves
had
taken
fright
at
this
rough
interruption
by
a
human
being
and
fled
to
the
deepest
caverns
of
the
earth
where
precious
gems
lay
hidden
jealous
of
their
own
splendor
this
is
a
pleasant
state
of
things
muttered
golfin
thinking
that
after
all
he
could
do
no
better
than
light
his
there
seems
no
reason
why
it
should
not
go
on
for
a
hundred
years
i
can
smoke
and
wait
it
was
a
clever
idea
of
mine
that
i
could
walk
up
alone
to
the
mines
of
socartes
my
luggage
will
have
got
there
before
me
a
signal
proof
of
the
advantages
of
straight
on
a
light
breeze
at
this
instant
sprang
up
and
golfin
fancied
he
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
at
the
bottom
of
the
unknown
or
imaginary
abyss
before
him
he
listened
sharply
and
in
a
minute
felt
quite
certain
that
some
one
was
walking
below
he
stood
up
and
shouted
girl
man
or
whoever
you
are
can
i
get
to
the
mines
of
socartes
by
this
road
he
had
not
done
speaking
when
he
heard
a
dog
barking
wildly
and
then
a
manly
voice
saying
choto
choto
come
here
hi
there
cried
the
traveller
my
good
friend
man
boy
demon
or
whatever
you
are
call
back
your
dog
for
i
am
a
man
of
peace
choto
choto
golfin
could
make
out
the
form
of
a
large
black
dog
coming
towards
him
but
after
sniffing
round
him
it
retired
at
its
master
call
and
at
that
moment
the
traveller
could
distinguish
a
figure
a
man
standing
as
immovable
as
a
stone
image
at
about
ten
paces
below
him
on
a
slanting
pathway
which
seemed
to
cut
across
the
steep
incline
this
path
and
the
human
form
standing
there
became
quite
clear
now
to
golfin
who
looking
up
to
the
sky
exclaimed
thank
god
here
is
the
mad
moon
at
last
now
we
can
see
where
we
are
i
had
not
the
faintest
notion
that
a
path
existed
so
close
to
me
why
it
is
quite
a
road
tell
me
my
friend
do
you
know
whether
the
mines
of
socartes
are
hereabout
yes
se침or
these
are
the
mines
of
socartes
but
we
are
at
some
distance
from
the
works
the
voice
which
spoke
thus
was
youthful
and
pleasant
with
the
attractive
inflection
that
indicates
a
polite
readiness
to
be
of
service
the
doctor
was
well
pleased
at
detecting
this
and
still
better
pleased
at
observing
the
soft
light
which
was
spreading
through
the
darkness
and
bringing
resurrection
to
earth
and
sky
as
though
calling
them
forth
from
nothingness
lux
he
said
going
forward
down
the
slope
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
emerged
into
existence
from
primeval
chaos
indeed
my
good
friend
i
am
truly
grateful
to
you
for
the
information
you
have
given
me
and
for
the
farther
information
you
no
doubt
will
give
me
i
left
villamojada
as
the
sun
was
they
told
me
to
go
on
straight
on
are
you
going
to
the
works
asked
the
strange
youth
without
stirring
from
the
spot
or
looking
up
towards
the
doctor
who
was
now
quite
near
him
yes
se침or
but
i
have
certainly
lost
my
way
well
this
is
not
the
entrance
to
the
mines
the
entrance
is
by
the
steps
at
rabagones
from
which
the
road
runs
and
the
that
they
are
making
if
you
had
gone
that
way
you
would
have
reached
the
works
in
ten
minutes
from
here
it
is
a
long
way
and
a
very
bad
road
we
are
at
the
outer
circle
of
the
mining
galleries
and
shall
have
to
go
through
passages
and
tunnels
down
ladders
through
cuttings
up
slopes
and
then
down
the
inclined
plane
in
short
cross
the
mines
from
this
side
to
the
other
where
the
workshops
are
and
the
furnaces
the
machines
and
the
well
i
seem
to
have
been
uncommonly
stupid
said
golfin
laughing
i
will
guide
you
with
much
pleasure
for
i
know
every
inch
of
the
place
golfin
whose
feet
sank
in
the
loose
earth
slipping
here
and
tottering
there
had
at
last
reached
the
solid
ground
of
the
path
and
his
first
idea
was
to
look
closely
at
the
lad
who
addressed
him
for
a
minute
or
two
he
was
speechless
with
surprise
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
blind
it
is
true
se침or
said
the
boy
but
i
can
run
without
seeing
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
mines
of
socartes
this
stick
i
carry
prevents
my
stumbling
and
choto
is
always
with
me
when
i
have
not
got
nela
with
me
who
is
my
guide
so
follow
me
se침or
and
allow
me
to
guide
you
chapter
ii
guided
right
and
were
you
born
blind
asked
golfin
with
eager
interest
arising
not
only
from
compassion
yes
se침or
born
blind
replied
the
lad
with
perfect
simplicity
i
only
know
the
world
by
fancy
feeling
and
hearing
i
have
learned
to
understand
that
the
most
wonderful
portion
of
the
universe
is
that
which
is
unknown
to
me
i
know
that
the
eyes
of
other
people
are
not
like
mine
since
they
are
able
to
distinguish
things
by
them
but
the
power
seems
to
me
so
extraordinary
that
i
can
not
even
imagine
the
possibility
of
its
existence
who
knows
golfin
began
but
what
strange
scene
is
this
my
friend
what
a
wonderful
place
we
are
in
the
traveller
who
had
been
walking
by
the
side
of
his
companion
stood
still
in
astonishment
at
the
weird
view
which
lay
before
him
they
were
in
a
deep
basin
resembling
the
crater
of
a
volcano
the
ground
at
the
bottom
was
broken
and
rough
and
the
sloping
sides
still
more
so
round
the
margin
and
in
the
middle
of
the
vast
caldron
which
looked
even
larger
than
it
was
in
the
deceptive
chiaroscuro
of
the
moonlit
night
stood
colossal
figures
deformed
caricatures
of
humanity
monsters
lying
prone
with
their
feet
in
the
air
with
arms
spread
in
despair
stunted
growths
distorted
faces
such
as
we
see
in
the
whimsical
wreathing
of
floating
clouds
but
all
still
silent
and
turned
to
stone
in
color
they
were
a
reddish
bistre
their
action
suggested
the
delirium
of
fever
arrested
by
sudden
death
it
was
as
though
giant
forms
had
petrified
in
the
midst
of
some
demoniacal
orgy
and
their
gestures
and
the
burlesque
grimaces
of
the
monstrous
heads
had
been
stricken
into
fixity
like
the
motionless
attitudes
of
sculpture
the
silence
which
prevailed
in
this
hollow
was
itself
terrifying
one
might
fancy
that
the
cries
and
shrieks
of
a
thousand
voices
had
been
petrified
too
and
had
been
held
there
locked
in
stone
for
ages
where
are
we
my
young
friend
asked
golfin
this
place
is
like
a
nightmare
this
part
of
the
mine
is
called
la
terrible
replied
the
blind
boy
not
appreciating
his
companion
frame
of
mind
it
was
worked
till
about
two
years
ago
when
the
ore
was
exhausted
and
now
the
mining
is
carried
on
in
other
parts
which
are
more
profitable
the
strange
objects
that
surprise
you
so
much
are
the
blocks
of
stone
which
we
call
and
which
consist
of
hardened
ferruginous
clay
after
the
ore
has
been
extracted
i
have
been
told
that
the
effect
is
sublime
particularly
in
the
moonlight
but
i
do
not
understand
such
things
a
wonderful
effect
yes
said
the
stranger
who
still
stood
gazing
at
the
scene
but
which
to
me
is
more
terrible
than
pleasing
for
it
reminds
me
of
the
horrors
of
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
is
like
it
is
as
if
i
were
standing
inside
a
monstrous
brain
suffering
from
a
fearful
headache
those
figures
are
like
the
images
which
present
themselves
to
the
tortured
brain
and
become
confounded
with
the
hideous
fancies
and
visions
created
by
a
fevered
mind
choto
choto
here
called
the
blind
lad
take
care
now
se침or
how
you
walk
we
are
going
into
a
gallery
and
in
fact
golfin
saw
that
his
guide
feeling
with
his
stick
was
making
his
way
towards
a
narrow
entrance
distinguished
by
three
stout
posts
the
dog
went
in
first
snuffing
at
the
black
cavern
the
blind
boy
followed
him
with
the
calm
indifference
of
a
man
who
dwells
in
perpetual
darkness
golfin
followed
not
without
some
instinctive
trepidation
and
repugnance
at
an
underground
expedition
it
is
really
wonderful
he
said
that
you
should
go
in
and
out
of
such
a
place
without
stumbling
i
have
lived
all
my
life
in
these
places
and
know
them
as
well
as
my
own
home
here
it
is
very
cold
wrap
yourself
up
if
have
you
a
cloak
with
you
we
shall
soon
be
out
at
the
other
end
he
walked
on
feeling
his
way
with
his
hand
along
the
wall
which
was
formed
of
upright
beams
and
saying
mind
you
do
not
stumble
over
the
ruts
in
the
path
they
bring
the
mineral
along
here
from
the
diggings
above
are
you
cold
tell
me
said
the
doctor
gaily
are
you
quite
certain
that
the
earth
has
not
swallowed
us
up
this
passage
is
the
gullet
of
some
monstrous
insectivorous
brute
into
whose
stomach
we
miserable
worms
have
inadvertently
do
you
often
take
a
walk
in
this
delectable
spot
yes
often
and
at
all
hours
and
i
think
the
place
delightful
now
we
are
in
the
most
arid
part
the
ground
here
is
pure
sand
now
we
are
on
the
stones
again
here
there
is
a
constant
drip
of
sulphurous
water
and
down
there
we
have
a
block
of
rock
in
which
there
are
petrified
shells
there
are
layers
of
slate
over
there
do
you
hear
that
toad
croaking
we
are
near
the
opening
now
the
rascal
sits
there
every
night
i
know
him
quite
well
he
has
a
hoarse
slow
voice
who
the
toad
yes
se침or
we
are
near
the
end
now
so
i
see
it
looks
like
an
eye
staring
at
us
that
is
the
mouth
of
the
corridor
no
sooner
were
they
out
in
the
air
again
than
the
first
thing
that
struck
the
doctor
ear
was
the
same
melancholy
song
as
he
had
heard
before
the
blind
boy
heard
it
too
he
turned
round
to
his
companion
and
said
smiling
with
pride
and
pleasure
do
you
hear
her
i
heard
that
voice
before
and
it
charmed
me
wonderfully
who
is
the
singer
instead
of
answering
the
blind
boy
stopped
and
shouted
with
all
the
force
of
his
lungs
nela
nela
and
the
name
was
repeated
by
a
hundred
echoes
some
quite
close
others
faint
and
distant
then
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
for
a
he
called
out
do
not
come
to
me
i
am
going
that
way
wait
for
me
at
the
forge
at
the
forge
he
turned
to
the
doctor
again
and
explained
nela
is
a
girl
who
goes
about
with
me
she
is
my
guide
my
when
it
was
dusk
we
were
coming
home
together
from
the
great
meadow
it
was
rather
cool
so
as
my
father
forbids
my
walking
out
at
night
without
a
cloak
i
waited
in
romolinos
cabin
and
nela
ran
home
to
fetch
it
for
me
after
staying
some
little
time
in
the
hut
i
remembered
that
i
had
a
friend
coming
to
see
me
at
home
and
i
had
not
patience
to
wait
for
nela
so
i
set
out
with
choto
i
was
just
going
down
la
terrible
when
i
met
you
we
shall
soon
be
at
the
forge
now
and
there
we
must
part
for
my
father
is
not
pleased
when
i
go
home
late
and
nela
will
show
you
the
way
to
the
works
many
thanks
my
little
friend
the
tunnel
had
brought
them
out
at
a
spot
even
more
wonderful
than
that
they
had
left
it
was
an
enormous
gulf
or
chasm
in
the
earth
looking
like
the
result
of
an
earthquake
but
it
had
not
been
rent
by
the
fierce
throbs
of
planetary
fires
but
slowly
wrought
by
the
laborious
pick
of
the
miner
it
looked
like
the
interior
of
a
huge
shipwrecked
vessel
stranded
on
the
shore
and
broken
across
the
waist
by
the
breakers
so
as
to
bend
it
at
an
obtuse
angle
you
could
fancy
you
saw
its
ribs
laid
bare
and
their
ends
standing
up
in
an
irregular
file
on
one
side
within
the
hollow
hull
lay
huge
stones
like
the
relics
of
a
cargo
tossed
about
by
the
waves
and
the
deceptive
light
of
the
moon
lent
so
much
aid
to
the
fancy
that
golfin
could
have
believed
that
he
saw
among
the
relics
of
a
ship
fittings
corpses
half
devoured
by
fishes
mummies
skeletons
all
dead
silent
and
still
as
if
they
had
long
been
lying
in
the
infinite
sepulchre
of
the
ocean
and
the
illusion
was
perfect
when
he
presently
heard
a
sound
of
waters
and
a
regular
splash
like
the
dash
of
ripples
in
the
hollow
of
a
rock
or
through
the
skeleton
timbers
of
a
wrecked
vessel
there
is
water
hereabouts
he
said
to
his
guide
the
noise
you
hear
replied
the
other
stopping
and
which
sounds
like
what
shall
i
say
like
the
gurgle
you
make
when
you
gargle
your
throat
exactly
and
where
is
that
gurgle
is
it
some
rivulet
that
runs
near
here
no
se침or
over
there
to
the
left
there
is
a
slope
and
beyond
it
a
wide
mouth
opens
in
the
ground
a
cavern
an
abyss
without
any
known
bottom
la
trascava
they
call
it
some
say
that
it
runs
down
to
the
sea
at
fic칩briga
and
others
think
that
a
river
flows
at
the
bottom
of
it
which
goes
round
and
round
like
a
wheel
and
never
comes
out
anywhere
i
fancy
it
must
be
like
a
whirlpool
some
again
say
that
down
there
is
a
constant
gust
of
air
coming
out
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
as
we
blow
when
we
whistle
and
that
this
blast
meets
a
current
of
water
then
they
quarrel
and
struggle
and
fight
and
produce
that
noise
that
we
hear
up
here
and
has
no
one
ever
been
down
into
this
cavern
it
can
only
be
got
into
in
one
way
how
by
jumping
into
it
those
who
have
gone
in
have
never
come
out
again
and
it
is
a
great
pity
for
they
might
have
told
us
what
goes
on
in
there
the
other
end
of
the
cavern
is
a
long
way
off
from
this
for
two
years
ago
when
some
miners
were
working
they
came
upon
a
rift
in
the
rock
where
they
heard
the
very
same
sound
of
water
as
you
hear
now
this
rift
must
no
doubt
communicate
with
the
inside
galleries
out
of
which
the
blast
blows
and
into
which
the
water
rushes
by
daylight
you
can
see
it
plainly
for
you
need
only
go
a
few
steps
to
the
left
to
reach
the
spot
and
there
is
a
comfortable
seat
there
some
people
are
frightened
to
go
there
but
nela
and
i
sit
there
to
listen
to
the
voice
down
inside
the
cavern
for
really
se침or
we
can
fancy
we
hear
it
talking
nela
declares
and
swears
that
she
hears
words
and
can
distinguish
them
quite
plainly
i
must
confess
i
never
heard
any
words
but
it
goes
on
murmuring
like
a
soliloquy
or
a
meditation
and
sometimes
it
is
sad
and
sometimes
gay
sometimes
angry
and
sometimes
and
jolly
and
yet
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
but
a
gurgle
said
the
doctor
laughing
it
sounds
so
from
this
but
we
must
not
stop
now
it
is
getting
late
you
must
be
prepared
to
go
through
another
gallery
another
yes
and
this
one
branches
off
into
two
in
the
middle
beyond
that
there
is
a
labyrinth
of
turns
and
zigzags
because
the
miners
have
to
make
galleries
which
when
they
are
worked
out
are
deserted
and
left
to
their
fate
go
on
choto
choto
slipped
into
a
little
opening
that
looked
scarcely
bigger
than
a
followed
by
the
doctor
and
his
guide
who
felt
his
way
along
the
dark
narrow
crooked
passage
with
his
stick
there
could
be
no
better
evidence
of
the
delicacy
and
subtlety
of
the
sense
of
touch
extending
beyond
the
skin
of
a
human
hand
through
a
piece
of
senseless
wood
they
went
forwards
at
first
in
a
curve
and
then
round
corner
after
corner
and
all
the
way
between
walls
of
damp
and
planking
do
you
know
what
this
reminds
me
of
said
the
doctor
perceiving
that
his
guide
took
pleasure
in
similes
and
comparisons
of
nothing
so
much
as
the
thoughts
of
perverse
man
we
represent
the
consciousness
of
evil
when
he
looks
into
his
conscience
and
sees
himself
in
all
his
vileness
golfin
fancied
that
he
had
used
a
metaphor
rather
above
his
comprehension
but
the
blind
boy
proved
that
he
was
mistaken
for
he
said
at
once
for
those
to
whom
that
inner
world
looks
dark
and
gloomy
these
galleries
must
be
dismal
indeed
but
i
who
live
in
perpetual
darkness
find
here
something
which
has
an
affinity
with
my
own
nature
i
can
walk
here
as
you
would
in
the
broadest
road
if
it
were
not
for
the
want
of
air
in
some
parts
and
the
excessive
damp
in
others
i
should
prefer
these
subterranean
passages
to
any
place
i
know
that
is
an
idea
of
brooding
fancy
i
feel
as
if
there
were
in
my
brain
a
narrow
passage
a
like
this
that
we
are
walking
in
and
there
my
ideas
run
riot
grandly
ah
what
a
pity
that
you
should
never
have
seen
the
azure
vault
of
the
sky
at
the
doctor
exclaimed
involuntarily
tell
me
does
this
dark
hole
in
which
your
ideas
run
riot
so
grandly
lead
out
anywhere
oh
yes
we
shall
be
outside
quite
soon
now
the
vault
of
the
sky
you
said
i
fancy
it
must
be
a
perfect
equal
curve
which
looks
as
if
we
could
touch
it
with
our
hands
but
we
can
not
really
as
he
spoke
they
got
out
of
the
tunnel
golfin
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
relief
like
a
man
who
has
cast
off
a
burthen
exclaimed
as
he
looked
up
at
the
heavens
thank
god
that
i
see
you
once
more
stars
of
the
firmament
never
have
you
seemed
to
me
more
beautiful
than
at
this
moment
as
i
was
going
along
said
the
blind
boy
holding
out
his
hand
which
held
a
stone
i
picked
up
this
piece
of
crystal
now
do
you
mean
to
say
that
these
crystals
which
to
my
touch
are
so
sharply
cut
so
smooth
and
so
neatly
packed
side
by
side
are
not
a
very
beautiful
thing
they
seem
so
to
me
at
any
rate
and
as
he
spoke
he
broke
off
some
of
the
crystals
my
dear
fellow
said
the
doctor
with
great
feeling
and
compassion
it
is
sad
indeed
that
you
should
not
be
able
to
know
that
this
stone
is
hardly
worth
looking
at
while
over
our
heads
there
hang
the
myriads
of
marvellous
lamps
that
sparkle
in
the
heavens
the
boy
threw
back
his
head
and
said
in
a
voice
of
deep
regret
is
it
true
that
you
are
there
you
little
stars
god
is
infinitely
great
and
merciful
said
golfin
laying
his
hand
on
his
young
companion
shoulder
who
knows
who
can
say
much
stranger
things
have
happened
are
happening
every
day
as
he
spoke
he
looked
close
into
his
face
trying
to
see
the
lad
eyes
by
the
dim
light
fixed
and
sightless
he
turned
them
in
the
direction
in
which
he
heard
the
speaker
voice
there
is
no
hope
golfin
muttered
they
had
come
out
on
an
open
space
the
moon
rising
higher
and
higher
illuminated
undulating
meadows
and
high
slopes
which
looked
like
the
ramparts
of
some
immense
to
the
left
on
a
level
plateau
the
doctor
saw
a
group
of
white
houses
crowning
the
slope
there
to
the
left
said
the
boy
is
my
home
up
at
the
top
do
you
know
that
those
three
houses
are
what
remain
of
the
village
of
aldeacorba
de
suso
all
the
rest
has
been
pulled
down
at
different
times
in
order
to
dig
mines
all
the
soil
underneath
is
iron
ore
and
our
lived
over
millions
of
wealth
without
knowing
it
he
was
still
speaking
when
a
girl
came
running
to
meet
them
a
tiny
scrap
of
a
child
swift
of
foot
and
slightly
built
nela
nela
cried
the
blind
boy
have
you
brought
me
a
cloak
here
it
is
said
the
girl
putting
it
over
his
shoulders
is
this
the
songstress
do
you
know
you
have
a
lovely
voice
oh
exclaimed
the
boy
in
a
tone
of
innocent
admiration
she
sings
beautifully
now
mariquilla
you
must
show
this
gentleman
the
way
to
the
works
and
i
must
go
home
i
can
hear
my
father
voice
already
he
is
coming
to
look
for
me
and
he
will
be
sure
to
scold
me
i
am
here
i
am
coming
make
haste
in
my
boy
said
golfin
shaking
hands
with
him
the
air
is
fresh
and
you
might
take
cold
many
thanks
for
your
company
i
hope
we
may
be
good
friends
for
i
shall
be
here
some
little
time
i
am
the
brother
of
c치rlos
golfin
the
engineer
of
the
mines
oh
indeed
don
c치rlos
is
a
great
friend
of
my
father
he
has
been
expecting
you
these
two
days
i
arrived
this
evening
at
the
station
at
villamojada
and
they
told
me
that
socartes
was
not
far
and
that
i
could
come
up
on
foot
so
as
i
like
to
see
the
country
and
get
exercise
and
as
they
told
me
it
was
straight
on
i
set
out
and
sent
my
luggage
in
a
cart
you
saw
how
i
had
lost
my
way
but
there
is
no
evil
out
of
which
good
does
not
come
i
have
made
your
acquaintance
and
we
shall
be
friends
very
good
friends
perhaps
go
in
get
home
quickly
for
the
autumn
evenings
are
not
good
for
you
the
little
se침ora
here
will
be
so
good
as
to
guide
me
it
is
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
to
the
works
quite
a
short
way
but
take
care
not
to
stumble
over
the
rails
and
look
out
as
you
cross
the
inclined
plane
there
often
are
trucks
on
the
road
and
in
this
damp
weather
the
ground
is
like
caballero
and
my
very
good
he
went
up
the
slope
by
a
narrow
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
soil
and
squared
by
beams
of
wood
golfin
went
straight
on
guided
by
nela
does
what
they
said
deserve
a
separate
chapter
in
case
it
should
i
will
give
it
one
chapter
iii
a
dialogue
which
explains
much
wait
a
moment
my
child
do
not
go
so
fast
said
golfin
himself
standing
still
i
want
to
light
a
cigar
the
night
was
so
still
that
no
precautions
were
needed
in
striking
the
light
to
guard
it
from
the
wind
and
when
the
doctor
had
lighted
his
cigar
he
held
the
wax
match
in
front
of
nela
saying
kindly
show
me
your
face
little
one
he
looked
in
the
child
face
with
astonishment
her
black
eyes
shone
with
a
red
spot
like
a
spark
for
the
instant
while
the
match
lasted
she
looked
a
child
for
she
was
but
a
tiny
creature
extremely
thin
and
undeveloped
but
she
seemed
like
a
little
woman
for
her
eyes
had
not
a
childlike
expression
and
her
face
had
the
mature
look
of
a
nature
which
has
gone
through
experience
and
acquired
judgment
or
will
have
acquired
it
soon
in
spite
of
this
anomaly
she
was
and
her
small
head
sat
gracefully
on
her
lean
little
body
you
might
have
said
she
was
a
woman
seen
through
a
or
again
that
she
was
a
child
with
the
eyes
and
expression
of
a
person
in
your
uncertainty
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
she
was
astonishingly
forward
or
lamentably
backward
how
old
are
you
asked
golfin
shaking
his
fingers
free
of
the
match
which
was
beginning
to
burn
them
they
say
i
am
sixteen
said
nela
gazing
in
her
turn
at
the
doctor
sixteen
exclaimed
golfin
much
less
than
that
child
you
are
twelve
at
most
to
judge
by
appearances
holy
virgin
they
say
i
am
quite
a
phenomenon
said
the
girl
in
a
tone
of
weariness
of
the
subject
a
phenomenon
repeated
golfin
laying
his
hand
on
her
hair
well
perhaps
so
now
come
along
show
me
the
way
nela
set
out
resolutely
keeping
but
a
little
way
in
front
of
the
traveller
but
rather
on
one
side
of
him
to
show
her
just
appreciation
of
such
illustrious
company
her
nimble
little
feet
which
were
bare
were
evidently
familiar
with
the
ground
they
trod
with
the
stones
the
puddles
and
the
thistles
she
wore
a
plain
frock
of
scanty
breadth
and
the
rudimentary
simplicity
of
her
garb
as
well
as
the
loose
flow
of
her
thick
short
hair
which
fell
in
natural
waves
had
a
stamp
of
savage
independence
rather
than
of
abject
poverty
her
speech
on
the
other
hand
struck
golfin
by
its
modest
propriety
indicating
a
formed
and
thoughtful
mind
her
voice
had
a
gentle
inflection
of
kindliness
which
could
not
be
the
result
of
education
and
her
glance
was
restless
and
shy
whenever
she
was
not
looking
at
the
sky
or
the
earth
tell
me
said
golfin
do
you
live
in
the
mines
are
you
the
child
of
any
of
the
workmen
employed
here
they
say
i
have
neither
father
nor
mother
poor
little
girl
and
you
work
in
the
mines
no
se침or
i
am
of
no
use
at
all
she
replied
without
raising
her
eyes
well
you
are
modest
at
any
rate
the
doctor
bent
down
to
look
closely
at
her
face
it
was
small
and
freckled
all
over
with
little
spots
her
forehead
was
narrow
her
nose
sharp
but
not
her
eyes
black
and
brilliant
but
their
light
shone
but
sadly
her
hair
naturally
of
a
golden
brown
was
dull
for
want
of
care
and
from
exposure
to
the
sun
wind
and
dust
her
lips
were
so
thin
as
to
be
hardly
visible
and
always
wore
a
smile
but
it
was
like
the
faint
smile
of
the
dead
who
have
died
dreaming
of
heaven
nela
mouth
was
strictly
speaking
ugly
still
it
deserved
a
word
of
praise
from
the
point
of
view
expressed
in
the
line
from
polo
de
medina
a
mouth
is
sweet
that
asks
for
nothing
in
fact
neither
in
word
look
or
smile
did
the
poor
child
betray
any
of
the
degrading
habits
of
the
beggar
golfin
stroked
the
sad
little
face
holding
it
under
the
chin
and
almost
encircling
it
with
his
big
fingers
poor
little
body
he
said
providence
has
not
been
to
you
who
do
you
live
with
with
se침or
centeno
the
overseer
of
the
beasts
belonging
to
the
mines
you
do
not
seem
to
have
been
born
in
who
were
your
parents
they
say
my
mother
sold
peppers
in
the
market
at
villamojada
she
was
not
married
she
had
me
one
day
and
then
she
went
to
be
at
madrid
a
highly
estimable
woman
muttered
golfin
ironically
and
no
one
knows
who
your
father
was
yes
se침or
said
nela
with
some
pride
my
father
was
the
first
who
ever
lighted
the
lamps
of
villamojada
wonderful
i
ought
to
tell
you
said
the
little
girl
with
the
gravity
befitting
the
dignity
of
history
that
when
the
town
council
first
had
lamps
hung
up
in
the
streets
my
father
was
entrusted
with
the
care
of
lighting
and
cleaning
them
i
was
nursed
by
a
sister
of
my
mother
not
that
she
was
married
either
as
they
tell
me
my
father
had
quarrelled
with
her
they
all
lived
together
as
i
have
heard
and
when
he
went
out
to
light
the
lamps
he
used
to
put
me
in
his
basket
with
his
and
cottons
and
oil
one
day
when
he
went
up
to
light
the
lamp
on
the
bridge
he
put
the
basket
on
the
parapet
and
i
rolled
out
and
fell
into
the
river
and
you
were
not
drowned
no
se침or
for
i
fell
on
the
stones
holy
mother
of
god
i
was
a
dear
little
thing
before
that
they
tell
me
yes
i
am
sure
you
were
said
the
stranger
with
an
impulse
of
and
so
you
are
but
tell
me
what
next
have
you
lived
long
in
the
mines
thirteen
years
they
say
my
mother
took
me
back
after
my
tumble
my
father
fell
ill
and
as
my
mother
would
not
do
anything
for
him
because
he
was
wicked
to
her
he
was
taken
to
the
hospital
where
they
say
he
died
meanwhile
my
mother
came
to
work
in
the
mines
they
say
the
overseer
discharged
her
one
day
because
she
drank
so
much
and
your
mother
went
go
on
i
take
a
real
interest
in
the
good
woman
she
went
she
went
to
a
very
big
hole
over
there
said
the
child
standing
still
and
speaking
with
intense
pathos
and
she
threw
herself
in
the
devil
she
did
that
was
coming
to
a
bad
end
i
suppose
she
did
not
come
out
again
no
se침or
said
nela
with
perfect
simplicity
she
is
there
still
and
since
that
catastrophe
poor
child
said
golfin
kindly
you
have
stayed
at
work
here
mining
work
is
very
hard
labor
and
you
have
taken
the
hue
of
the
soil
you
are
thin
and
this
life
is
enough
to
ruin
the
strongest
constitution
no
se침or
i
do
not
labor
they
say
i
am
not
good
for
anything
and
never
shall
be
god
forbid
silly
child
why
you
are
a
treasure
no
indeed
insisted
the
girl
i
can
not
work
at
all
if
i
take
up
ever
so
small
a
load
i
fall
down
and
if
i
am
set
to
any
hard
work
i
faint
away
before
long
you
are
as
god
made
you
and
if
you
fell
into
the
hands
of
any
one
who
knew
how
to
treat
you
you
would
work
very
well
no
se침or
no
indeed
she
repeated
as
energetically
as
though
it
were
in
her
own
praise
that
she
spoke
i
am
no
good
to
any
one
only
in
the
way
then
you
are
a
mere
vagabond
no
se침or
for
i
attend
on
pablo
and
who
is
pablo
that
young
blind
gentleman
whom
you
met
in
la
terrible
i
have
been
his
guide
for
the
last
year
and
a
half
i
take
him
everywhere
we
go
for
long
walks
in
the
fields
he
seems
a
good
fellow
this
pablo
nela
again
stood
still
and
looked
up
at
the
doctor
and
her
face
glowed
with
enthusiasm
as
she
exclaimed
holy
virgin
he
is
the
best
and
dearest
creature
in
the
whole
world
poor
fellow
and
he
is
cleverer
without
eyes
than
all
those
who
can
see
yes
i
liked
your
master
does
he
belong
to
the
place
yes
se침or
he
is
the
only
son
of
don
francisco
pen치guilas
a
very
kind
and
very
rich
gentleman
who
lives
in
the
houses
at
aldeacorba
tell
me
why
are
you
called
nela
what
does
it
mean
the
child
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
after
a
pause
she
said
my
mother
name
was
mar칤a
canela
and
so
she
was
called
nela
they
say
it
is
a
dog
name
my
name
is
mar칤a
mariquita
mar칤a
nela
they
call
me
or
sometimes
canela
girl
and
some
say
marianela
and
some
merely
nela
and
your
master
is
he
fond
of
you
yes
se침or
he
is
very
good
to
me
he
says
he
sees
with
my
eyes
for
i
take
him
everywhere
and
tell
him
what
everything
is
like
everything
that
he
can
not
see
the
stranger
seemed
much
interested
in
this
conversation
yes
i
tell
him
everything
he
asks
me
what
a
star
is
like
and
i
tell
him
all
about
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
the
same
to
him
as
if
he
could
see
it
i
explain
it
all
what
the
planets
are
like
and
the
clouds
and
the
sky
and
the
water
and
the
lightning
the
the
butterflies
the
mists
the
snails
and
the
shapes
and
faces
of
men
and
animals
i
tell
him
what
is
ugly
and
what
is
pretty
and
so
he
gets
to
understand
everything
i
see
your
work
is
no
trifle
what
is
ugly
and
what
is
pretty
there
is
nothing
you
decide
upon
that
question
tell
me
can
you
read
no
i
tell
you
i
am
good
for
nothing
she
said
this
in
a
tone
of
perfect
conviction
and
the
gesture
that
emphasized
her
protestation
seemed
to
add
you
must
be
a
great
blockhead
to
fancy
that
i
am
good
for
anything
would
you
not
be
glad
if
your
friend
by
the
grace
of
god
should
recover
his
sight
the
girl
did
not
answer
at
once
but
after
a
pause
she
said
it
is
impossible
no
not
impossible
only
difficult
and
doubtful
the
engineer
who
manages
the
mines
did
give
my
master
father
some
hope
of
it
don
c치rlos
golfin
yes
se침or
don
c치rlos
has
a
brother
who
is
an
and
they
say
he
gives
sight
to
the
blind
and
makes
those
who
squint
look
straight
what
a
clever
man
yes
and
when
the
wrote
to
don
c치rlos
that
he
was
coming
to
see
him
his
brother
wrote
to
him
to
bring
his
instruments
with
him
to
try
if
he
could
make
pablo
see
and
has
this
good
man
been
here
yet
no
sir
for
he
is
always
travelling
about
in
england
and
america
and
it
seems
it
will
be
some
time
yet
before
he
comes
pablo
laughs
at
it
all
and
says
no
man
can
give
him
what
the
holy
virgin
has
denied
him
from
his
birth
well
perhaps
he
is
right
but
are
we
not
nearly
there
for
i
see
some
chimneys
which
pour
forth
smoke
darker
than
the
bottomless
pit
and
a
light
too
which
looks
like
a
forge
yes
here
we
are
those
are
the
roasting
furnaces
which
burn
day
and
night
there
in
front
are
the
machines
for
washing
the
ore
they
only
work
by
day
to
the
is
the
chemical
workshop
and
down
there
last
of
all
the
and
offices
the
place
seemed
to
lie
in
fact
as
marianela
indicated
in
the
absence
of
any
wind
a
mist
hung
over
the
spot
shrouding
the
buildings
in
heavy
gaseous
fog
and
giving
them
a
confused
and
fantastic
outline
against
the
moonlit
sky
this
is
a
pleasanter
place
to
see
for
once
than
to
live
in
said
golfin
hastening
onwards
the
cloud
of
vapor
wraps
round
everything
and
the
lights
have
dim
circles
round
them
like
the
moon
on
a
sultry
night
which
is
the
office
here
we
are
almost
there
after
passing
in
front
of
the
furnaces
where
the
heat
made
them
hurry
on
the
doctor
perceived
a
house
which
was
no
less
dingy
and
smoky
than
the
others
and
at
the
same
instant
he
heard
a
piano
being
played
with
a
vigor
bordering
on
frenzy
we
have
music
here
i
recognize
my
touch
and
execution
it
is
se침orita
sof칤a
who
is
playing
said
mar칤a
the
lights
of
a
busy
household
shone
in
the
windows
and
the
balcony
on
the
was
wide
open
a
small
spark
was
visible
the
spark
of
a
cigar
before
the
doctor
could
reach
the
spot
the
spark
flew
off
describing
a
parabola
of
fire
and
breaking
into
a
thousand
twinkling
specks
the
smoker
had
shaken
the
end
off
there
is
that
everlasting
smoker
cried
the
doctor
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
delight
c치rlos
c치rlos
teodoro
exclaimed
a
voice
from
the
balcony
the
piano
ceased
like
a
scared
by
a
noise
steps
sounded
through
the
house
the
doctor
gave
his
guide
a
silver
coin
and
ran
up
to
the
door
chapter
iv
stony
hearts
retracing
her
steps
and
jumping
over
the
obstacles
in
her
path
nela
made
her
way
to
a
house
on
the
left
of
the
and
close
to
the
stables
where
the
sixty
mules
belonging
to
the
establishment
stood
in
grave
meditation
the
residence
of
the
overseer
though
of
modern
construction
was
neither
elegant
nor
even
commodious
the
roof
was
low
and
it
was
too
small
by
far
to
give
adequate
shelter
to
the
parent
couple
of
the
centenos
to
their
four
children
to
their
cat
and
to
nela
into
the
bargain
but
it
figured
nevertheless
on
the
parchment
plans
of
the
settlement
under
the
ostentatious
name
of
residence
inside
the
house
seemed
to
afford
a
practical
illustration
of
the
saying
which
we
have
already
heard
so
emphatically
stated
by
marianela
namely
that
she
marianela
was
of
no
good
to
anyone
only
in
the
way
somehow
in
there
room
was
found
for
everything
for
the
father
and
mother
for
their
sons
and
their
sons
tools
for
a
heap
of
rubbish
of
the
use
of
which
no
irrefragable
proof
has
been
found
for
the
cat
for
the
dish
off
which
the
cat
was
fed
for
tanasio
guitar
for
the
materials
of
which
tanasio
made
his
a
kind
of
lidless
hamper
for
half
a
dozen
old
for
the
blackbird
cage
for
two
useless
old
boilers
for
an
altar
at
which
dame
centeno
worshipped
the
divinity
with
offerings
of
artificial
flowers
and
some
patriarchal
tapers
a
perennial
settlement
for
flies
in
short
for
everything
and
everybody
excepting
little
mar칤a
canela
constantly
some
one
was
heard
to
say
you
can
not
take
a
step
without
falling
over
that
confounded
child
nela
or
else
get
into
your
corner
what
a
plague
the
creature
is
she
does
nothing
and
lets
no
one
else
do
anything
the
house
consisted
of
three
rooms
and
a
loft
the
first
of
these
served
not
only
as
and
but
also
as
the
bedroom
of
the
two
elders
in
the
second
slept
the
two
young
ladies
already
women
and
named
and
tanasio
the
eldest
of
all
stored
himself
in
the
garret
and
celipin
the
youngest
of
the
family
and
nearly
twelve
years
old
had
a
bed
in
the
kitchen
the
innermost
room
the
dingiest
dampest
and
least
habitable
of
the
three
rooms
which
composed
the
mansion
of
the
centenos
nela
during
the
many
years
of
her
residence
there
had
inhabited
various
nooks
and
corners
going
from
one
to
another
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
to
make
way
for
the
thousand
objects
which
served
only
to
curtail
the
last
scanty
accommodation
left
for
human
beings
on
some
occasion
the
precise
facts
are
unknown
to
history
tanasio
whose
feet
were
as
crippled
as
his
brain
and
who
devoted
himself
to
the
manufacture
of
large
hampers
made
of
hazel
rods
had
placed
in
the
kitchen
a
pile
of
at
least
half
a
dozen
of
these
bulky
trophies
of
his
art
marianela
looked
on
casting
her
eyes
sadly
around
and
finding
no
corner
left
into
which
to
creep
but
the
predicament
itself
inspired
her
with
a
happy
idea
which
she
at
once
acted
upon
she
simply
got
into
one
of
the
baskets
and
there
passed
the
night
in
sound
and
blissful
sleep
in
fact
it
was
comfortable
enough
and
when
it
was
cold
she
pulled
another
basket
on
the
top
from
that
time
so
long
as
there
were
a
local
name
for
these
coarse
open
baskets
to
be
found
she
never
was
at
a
loss
for
a
crib
and
the
others
would
say
of
the
child
she
sleeps
like
a
jewel
during
meals
in
the
midst
of
a
noisy
discussion
on
the
morning
work
a
voice
would
suddenly
say
in
rough
tones
here
and
nela
would
have
a
plate
given
her
by
one
of
the
family
big
or
small
and
would
seat
herself
against
the
big
chest
to
eat
what
she
had
got
in
silence
but
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
sometimes
the
master
harsh
bleating
voice
would
be
lifted
up
saying
with
a
perfunctory
air
of
benevolence
mother
you
have
given
poor
nela
nothing
and
then
a
compound
name
abbreviated
from
se침ora
ana
would
move
her
head
about
as
if
trying
to
see
some
minute
and
remote
object
between
the
bodies
of
her
own
children
saying
as
she
did
so
what
are
you
there
i
thought
you
had
stayed
at
aldeacorba
at
night
after
supper
the
family
repeated
the
paternoster
over
their
beads
and
then
staggering
like
bacchantes
and
rubbing
their
eyes
with
their
fists
mariuca
and
pepina
went
to
their
beds
which
were
snug
and
comfortable
and
covered
with
patchwork
quilts
in
a
few
minutes
a
duet
of
contralto
snoring
was
heard
which
lasted
without
intermission
till
morning
dawned
tanasio
went
up
to
the
higher
regions
and
celipin
curled
himself
round
on
a
heap
of
rags
not
far
from
the
basket
into
which
nela
disappeared
from
sight
the
family
thus
being
disposed
of
the
parents
sat
up
for
a
while
in
the
and
while
centeno
seating
himself
with
a
stretch
close
to
the
little
table
and
taking
up
a
newspaper
made
a
series
of
grimaces
to
convey
his
bold
intention
of
reading
it
his
wife
took
a
stocking
full
of
money
out
of
the
family
chest
and
after
counting
it
and
adding
or
taking
out
a
few
pieces
carefully
restored
it
to
its
place
then
she
took
out
sundry
paper
packets
containing
gold
pieces
and
transferred
some
from
one
parcel
to
another
meanwhile
such
remarks
as
these
were
made
mariuca
petticoat
cost
i
gave
tanasio
the
six
he
had
to
pay
we
only
want
eleven
to
make
up
the
five
hundred
or
on
the
other
hand
the
deputies
agreed
yesterday
a
conference
was
held
etc
se침ana
fingers
did
her
sums
while
her
husband
forefinger
passed
doubtfully
and
waveringly
along
the
lines
to
guide
his
eye
and
mind
through
the
labyrinth
of
letters
and
these
sentences
gradually
died
away
into
monosyllables
one
yawned
then
the
other
and
at
last
all
sunk
into
silence
after
extinguishing
the
lamp
by
which
the
overseer
of
the
mules
had
been
cultivating
his
mind
one
night
when
all
was
quiet
a
creaking
of
baskets
became
audible
in
the
kitchen
it
was
not
perfectly
dark
there
for
the
shutters
of
the
little
window
were
never
shut
and
celipin
centeno
who
was
not
yet
asleep
saw
the
topmost
baskets
which
were
packed
one
inside
the
other
rising
slowly
like
a
gaping
and
out
of
the
opening
peeped
the
nose
and
black
eyes
of
nela
celipin
she
said
celipinillo
are
you
asleep
and
she
put
a
hand
out
no
i
am
awake
nela
you
look
like
a
mussel
in
its
shell
what
do
you
want
here
take
this
it
is
a
that
a
gentleman
gave
me
this
evening
the
brother
of
don
c치rlos
how
much
have
you
got
now
this
is
something
like
a
present
now
i
have
given
you
something
better
than
coppers
give
it
here
and
thank
you
very
much
nela
said
the
boy
sitting
up
to
reach
the
money
you
have
given
me
nearly
now
a
copper
at
a
time
i
have
it
all
safe
here
inside
my
shirt
in
the
little
bag
you
gave
me
you
are
a
real
good
girl
i
do
not
want
money
for
anything
but
take
good
care
of
it
for
if
se침ana
were
to
find
it
she
would
think
you
would
get
into
some
mischief
with
it
and
thrash
you
with
the
big
stick
no
no
it
is
not
to
get
into
mischief
said
the
boy
vehemently
and
clenching
the
money
to
his
breast
with
one
hand
while
he
supported
himself
on
the
other
it
is
to
make
myself
a
rich
man
nela
a
clever
man
like
some
i
know
on
sunday
if
they
will
let
me
go
to
villamojada
i
must
buy
a
to
learn
to
read
although
they
will
not
teach
me
here
who
cares
i
will
learn
by
myself
do
you
know
nela
they
say
that
don
c치rlos
is
the
son
of
a
man
who
swept
the
streets
in
madrid
and
he
all
by
himself
learnt
everything
he
knows
and
so
you
think
you
can
do
the
same
noodle
i
believe
you
if
father
will
not
take
me
away
from
these
confounded
mines
i
will
find
some
other
way
ah
you
shall
see
what
sort
of
a
man
i
am
i
was
never
meant
for
that
nela
you
just
wait
till
i
have
collected
a
good
sum
and
then
you
will
see
you
will
see
how
i
will
find
a
place
in
the
town
there
or
take
the
train
to
madrid
or
a
steamboat
to
carry
me
over
to
the
islands
out
there
or
get
a
place
as
a
servant
to
some
one
who
will
let
me
study
dear
mother
of
heaven
exclaimed
nela
opening
her
still
wider
and
putting
out
her
whole
head
how
quiet
you
have
kept
all
these
sly
plans
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
i
tell
you
what
nela
i
am
in
a
mad
rage
i
can
not
live
like
this
i
shall
die
in
the
mines
drat
it
all
why
i
spend
my
nights
in
crying
and
my
hands
are
all
knocked
to
pieces
and
but
do
not
be
frightened
nela
at
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
do
not
think
me
wicked
i
would
not
say
it
to
any
other
living
soul
well
i
do
not
love
father
and
mother
not
as
i
ought
oh
if
you
say
such
things
i
will
never
give
you
another
celipin
for
god
sake
think
of
what
you
are
saying
i
can
not
help
it
why
just
look
how
we
go
on
here
we
are
not
human
beings
we
are
brutes
sometimes
i
almost
think
we
are
less
than
the
mules
and
i
ask
myself
if
i
am
in
any
way
better
than
a
donkey
fetching
a
basket
of
the
ore
and
pitching
it
into
a
truck
shoving
the
truck
up
to
the
furnaces
stirring
the
mineral
with
a
stick
to
wash
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
the
hapless
boy
began
to
sob
bitterly
drat
drat
it
all
but
if
you
spend
years
upon
years
in
work
like
this
you
are
bound
to
go
to
the
bad
at
last
your
very
brains
turn
to
no
i
was
never
meant
for
this
i
tell
my
father
to
let
me
go
away
and
learn
something
and
he
answers
that
we
are
poor
and
that
i
am
too
full
of
we
are
nothing
nothing
but
brutes
grinding
out
a
living
day
by
why
do
you
say
nothing
but
nela
did
not
answer
perhaps
she
was
comparing
the
boy
hard
lot
with
her
own
and
finding
her
own
much
the
worse
of
the
two
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
she
replied
at
last
i
can
never
be
any
good
to
any
one
i
am
nobody
i
can
say
nothing
to
you
but
do
not
think
such
wicked
things
about
your
father
i
mean
you
only
say
so
to
comfort
me
but
you
know
quite
well
it
is
true
and
i
do
believe
you
are
crying
i
no
yes
you
are
i
am
sure
every
one
has
something
to
cry
for
said
mar칤a
in
a
broken
voice
but
it
is
very
late
celipin
we
must
go
to
sleep
no
indeed
not
if
i
know
it
yes
child
go
to
sleep
and
do
not
think
of
such
miserable
things
the
shell
closed
and
all
was
silent
we
hear
a
great
deal
said
about
the
hard
and
narrow
materialism
of
cities
a
dry
rot
which
amid
all
the
splendor
and
pleasures
of
civilization
eats
into
the
moral
cohesion
of
society
but
there
is
a
worse
and
deeper
disease
the
parochial
materialism
of
country
villages
which
ossifies
millions
of
living
beings
crushes
every
noble
ambition
in
their
souls
and
shuts
them
into
the
petty
round
of
a
mechanical
existence
reducing
them
to
the
meanest
animal
instincts
there
are
many
more
blatant
evils
in
the
social
order
as
for
instance
speculation
usury
the
worship
of
mammon
among
men
of
high
culture
but
above
all
these
broods
a
monster
which
secretly
and
silently
ruins
more
than
all
else
and
that
is
the
greed
of
the
peasant
the
covetous
peasant
acknowledges
no
moral
law
has
no
religion
no
clear
notions
of
right
and
wrong
they
are
all
inextricably
mixed
up
in
his
mind
with
a
strange
compound
of
superstition
and
calculating
avarice
behind
an
air
of
hypocritical
simplicity
there
lies
a
sinister
arithmetic
which
for
keenness
and
intelligibility
far
transcends
the
methods
of
the
best
mathematicians
a
peasant
who
has
taken
a
fancy
to
hoard
copper
coin
and
dreams
of
changing
it
presently
into
silver
and
then
the
silver
into
gold
is
the
most
ignoble
creature
in
creation
he
is
capable
of
every
form
and
device
of
malice
known
to
man
combined
with
an
absence
of
feeling
that
is
appalling
his
soul
shrinks
and
shrivels
till
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
minim
measure
ignorance
coarseness
and
squalor
complete
the
abominable
compound
and
deprive
it
of
all
the
means
of
veiling
the
desolation
within
he
can
only
count
on
his
fingers
but
he
is
capable
of
reducing
to
figures
all
moral
sense
conscience
and
the
soul
itself
se침ana
and
centeno
who
after
many
struggles
had
contrived
to
earn
their
morsel
of
bread
in
the
mines
of
socartes
were
able
to
make
with
the
added
toil
of
their
four
children
a
daily
wage
which
they
would
have
regarded
as
a
princely
fortune
in
the
days
when
they
wandered
from
fair
to
fair
selling
pots
and
pipkins
it
should
be
mentioned
with
regard
to
the
intellectual
powers
of
centeno
that
his
head
in
the
opinion
of
many
persons
rivalled
the
in
the
workshops
for
sheer
hardness
with
no
disparagement
to
that
of
dame
ana
his
wife
who
seemed
to
be
a
woman
of
much
prudence
and
discrimination
and
who
governed
her
household
as
carefully
as
the
wisest
prince
could
govern
his
dominions
she
bagged
the
wages
earned
by
her
husband
and
children
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
and
they
amounted
to
a
neat
little
sum
and
each
time
the
money
was
brought
home
she
felt
as
if
the
very
sacrament
itself
were
being
carried
in
so
intense
was
her
delight
at
the
mere
sight
of
coin
se침ana
afforded
her
children
very
little
comfort
in
return
for
the
fortune
she
was
accumulating
by
the
labor
of
their
hands
however
as
they
never
complained
of
the
utter
and
debasing
misery
in
which
they
lived
as
they
betrayed
no
wish
for
emancipation
nor
for
a
breath
of
any
nobler
life
worthier
of
intelligent
beings
se침ana
let
the
days
slip
on
many
indeed
had
slipped
away
before
her
children
slept
in
beds
and
many
many
more
before
their
brawny
limbs
were
covered
with
decent
garments
she
gave
them
regular
and
wholesome
meals
following
in
this
respect
the
rules
most
in
vogue
but
eating
in
her
house
was
a
melancholy
ceremony
nevertheless
a
mere
doling
out
of
fodder
as
it
were
to
human
animals
so
far
as
mental
nourishment
was
concerned
se침ana
firmly
believed
that
her
husband
erudition
acquired
by
much
miscellaneous
reading
was
amply
sufficient
to
credit
the
whole
family
with
learning
and
for
that
reason
she
forbore
to
cram
the
minds
of
her
progeny
even
with
the
amount
of
instruction
which
is
given
in
schools
the
elder
ones
helped
her
and
the
youngest
lived
free
of
pedagogues
buried
alive
for
twelve
hours
out
of
every
in
brutalizing
toil
in
the
mines
so
that
the
whole
family
swam
at
large
and
at
leisure
in
the
vast
and
stagnant
ocean
of
dulness
the
two
girls
mariuca
and
pepina
were
not
destitute
of
charms
though
youth
and
robust
growth
were
the
chief
one
of
them
read
fluently
but
not
the
other
and
so
far
as
knowledge
of
the
world
was
concerned
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
some
rudimentary
information
at
least
was
not
lacking
to
girls
who
lived
with
a
perfect
chorus
of
nymphs
of
all
ages
and
every
grade
of
respectability
or
the
contrary
perpetually
employed
in
mechanical
work
which
left
their
tongues
free
to
wag
mariuca
and
pepina
were
buxom
and
well
grown
and
as
erect
and
strong
as
amazons
they
wore
short
petticoats
displaying
half
the
calf
of
the
leg
which
as
well
as
their
broad
feet
was
bare
and
their
rough
heads
might
have
supported
an
architrave
as
stoutly
as
those
of
caryatides
the
russet
dust
of
the
iron
ore
which
colored
them
from
head
to
foot
like
all
in
the
mines
gave
them
the
appearance
of
massive
figures
in
tanasio
was
a
lethargic
being
his
want
of
character
and
ambition
verged
on
idiocy
confined
to
the
house
from
his
earliest
years
incapable
of
taking
any
exercise
of
feeling
either
annoyance
or
pleasure
or
of
fulfilling
any
task
the
boy
who
was
born
to
be
a
machine
had
sunk
into
something
not
superior
to
the
roughest
tool
the
day
which
found
such
a
creature
able
to
originate
an
idea
would
infallibly
see
the
total
subversion
of
the
order
of
nature
for
hitherto
no
stone
has
been
known
to
think
the
relation
of
this
family
to
their
mother
was
that
of
abject
submission
on
their
part
and
unlimited
despotism
on
hers
the
only
child
who
ever
dared
to
show
symptoms
of
rebellion
was
the
little
one
se침ana
with
her
narrow
capacities
could
not
at
all
understand
this
diabolical
ambition
to
be
something
better
than
a
stone
was
there
did
he
suppose
any
happier
or
more
exemplary
life
than
that
of
a
stone
she
would
not
admit
that
it
might
be
changed
even
for
that
of
a
rolling
stone
se침ana
loved
her
children
but
there
are
so
many
ways
of
loving
she
placed
them
above
every
other
consideration
so
long
as
they
submitted
to
work
perpetually
in
the
mines
to
pour
all
their
earnings
into
one
bowl
to
obey
her
blindly
to
cherish
no
wild
aspirations
nor
wish
to
appear
in
fine
clothes
not
to
marry
too
young
nor
to
learn
any
mischievous
trash
and
cram
their
heads
with
since
poor
folks
she
would
say
must
always
remain
poor
and
behave
as
such
and
not
be
wanting
to
jabber
in
the
style
of
the
rich
city
folks
who
were
eaten
up
with
vices
and
rotten
with
sin
i
have
described
the
manners
and
customs
which
prevailed
in
the
centeno
house
in
order
that
the
reader
may
understand
the
life
to
which
nela
was
doomed
a
helpless
forsaken
creature
alone
useless
incapable
of
earning
a
day
wages
alike
without
a
past
and
without
a
future
with
no
right
to
anything
on
earth
beyond
a
bare
subsistence
se침ana
gave
her
this
and
firmly
believed
that
her
generosity
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
many
a
time
would
she
say
as
she
filled
nela
little
platter
what
a
reward
i
am
laying
up
for
myself
hereafter
in
heaven
and
she
believed
it
as
if
it
were
gospel
no
true
light
could
penetrate
her
thick
skull
as
to
the
saintly
exercise
of
charity
she
could
never
have
understood
that
a
kind
word
a
caress
a
loving
and
gentle
action
which
may
make
a
wretch
forget
his
misery
are
infinitely
more
precious
aye
and
more
heroic
than
the
broken
meat
left
from
a
bad
meal
it
was
but
a
chance
that
she
did
not
give
them
to
the
cat
who
at
least
was
far
more
kindly
spoken
to
nela
never
heard
herself
addressed
as
little
pet
precious
darling
nor
by
any
other
of
the
sweet
and
endearing
names
that
were
lavished
on
the
cat
nothing
ever
suggested
to
nela
that
she
was
born
of
human
beings
like
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
house
she
was
never
punished
but
she
felt
that
this
immunity
arose
from
their
contemptuous
pity
for
her
feeble
frame
and
certainly
not
from
any
special
esteem
or
care
for
her
person
no
one
had
ever
taught
her
that
she
had
a
soul
ready
to
bring
forth
good
fruit
if
she
cultivated
it
with
care
nor
that
she
bore
within
herself
like
other
mortals
that
spark
of
the
divine
fire
which
is
called
human
intelligence
and
that
this
spark
might
be
fanned
to
beneficent
light
and
flame
no
one
had
ever
told
her
that
her
grotesque
smallness
included
in
itself
the
germ
of
every
noble
and
delicate
sentiment
and
that
those
tiny
buds
might
open
out
to
lovely
flowers
with
no
more
cultivation
than
a
herb
that
we
glance
at
now
and
again
no
one
had
told
her
that
she
had
a
right
by
the
very
sternness
of
nature
in
creating
her
to
certain
tender
cares
which
the
strong
can
dispense
with
the
healthy
and
those
who
have
parents
and
a
home
since
under
the
laws
of
christian
jurisprudence
the
helpless
the
poor
the
orphan
and
the
destitute
are
all
alike
worthy
of
protection
on
the
other
hand
everything
combined
to
impress
upon
her
her
absolute
resemblance
to
a
rolling
stone
which
has
not
even
a
shape
of
its
own
but
takes
that
which
the
waters
give
it
or
the
kick
of
the
man
that
spurns
it
everything
told
her
that
her
place
in
the
house
was
something
below
the
cat
whose
sleek
back
received
the
only
caresses
ever
bestowed
on
anyone
and
the
blackbird
that
hopped
about
its
cage
and
of
them
at
any
rate
no
one
said
in
heartless
compassion
poor
creature
it
is
a
pity
she
did
not
die
chapter
labor
and
a
landscape
with
figures
the
smoke
of
the
furnaces
which
all
night
through
were
wide
awake
and
panting
out
their
hot
hoarse
breath
caught
a
silvery
gleam
as
its
wreaths
rolled
into
the
distance
the
faint
smile
of
dawn
fell
upon
the
remotest
peaks
of
the
mountains
and
by
degrees
the
hills
that
guard
socartes
came
out
of
the
darkness
the
huge
slopes
of
earth
and
the
blackened
buildings
the
bell
of
the
works
rang
out
shrilly
its
call
to
work
to
work
and
hundreds
of
sleepy
souls
came
out
of
the
houses
huts
hovels
holes
even
doors
creaked
on
their
hinges
the
mules
came
reluctantly
out
of
the
stables
making
their
way
to
their
and
the
whole
establishment
which
had
just
now
looked
like
a
city
of
the
dead
lighted
up
by
the
infernal
glare
of
the
furnaces
came
to
life
and
began
to
stir
its
thousand
arms
the
steam
soon
was
seething
in
the
boilers
of
the
great
which
supplied
the
motive
power
both
for
the
workshops
and
the
the
water
which
performed
the
principal
part
in
the
operations
began
to
flow
through
the
raised
conduits
from
which
it
fell
on
the
cylinders
files
of
men
and
women
just
risen
from
their
beds
made
their
way
down
to
the
scene
of
labor
and
at
length
the
cylindrical
sieves
began
to
revolve
with
hideous
groaning
the
water
rushed
from
one
to
the
other
pulverizing
the
dark
earth
which
tumbled
on
in
muddy
eddies
and
cataracts
from
trough
to
trough
till
it
settled
at
last
in
a
fine
powder
the
sound
was
as
of
a
thousand
hungry
jaws
chewing
grit
and
sand
the
play
of
light
on
water
and
soil
made
it
as
dazzling
as
a
kaleidoscope
and
the
clatter
was
like
some
enormous
hollow
drum
filled
with
pebbles
and
potsherds
it
was
impossible
to
look
on
without
turning
giddy
at
the
incessant
whirl
of
a
vast
skein
as
it
were
of
threads
of
water
some
clear
and
transparent
others
stained
red
by
the
ferruginous
clay
nor
could
any
human
brain
that
was
not
accustomed
to
the
spectacle
picture
to
itself
this
mad
struggle
of
toothed
wheels
which
never
ceased
biting
at
each
other
of
cogs
that
met
and
caught
and
rolled
away
again
of
screws
which
as
they
turned
shrieked
in
pitiless
clamor
for
oil
the
washing
was
all
done
in
the
open
air
the
connecting
belts
came
humming
down
from
the
machinery
sheds
other
belts
began
to
revolve
and
at
the
same
time
a
rhythmical
stamping
was
heard
a
slow
and
awful
tramp
like
a
giant
step
or
a
fearful
throbbing
inside
mother
earth
this
was
the
great
hammer
which
had
begun
to
beat
its
stupendous
blows
moulded
the
iron
like
a
paste
and
those
huge
wheels
and
beams
which
look
as
if
made
to
last
forever
began
to
twist
and
writhe
like
the
limbs
of
men
in
torment
while
the
hammer
with
its
monotonous
impact
created
new
forms
as
strong
as
the
rocks
which
are
the
work
of
ages
for
the
results
of
labor
have
a
strange
resemblance
to
the
results
of
patience
men
so
black
that
they
look
like
hewn
and
animated
coal
gathered
round
the
fiery
objects
that
were
taken
from
the
forges
and
seizing
them
with
those
prolonged
hands
known
as
tongs
set
to
work
to
hammer
them
it
is
a
strange
kind
of
sculpture
this
which
has
fire
for
its
inspiring
genius
and
a
for
its
chisel
wheels
and
for
thousands
of
trucks
and
the
damaged
portions
of
the
were
repaired
here
and
picks
spades
and
barrows
were
made
at
the
back
of
the
workshops
saws
hissed
through
blocks
of
timber
and
the
iron
which
had
been
formed
for
labor
by
fire
of
wood
now
cut
through
the
sturdy
fibre
of
trees
hewn
by
the
axe
from
their
native
spot
meanwhile
the
mules
had
been
harnessed
to
long
trains
of
trucks
which
carried
off
the
waste
earth
to
add
it
to
the
slopes
already
made
or
fetched
the
mineral
to
be
washed
they
looked
like
immense
reptiles
crawling
up
and
down
to
meet
each
other
and
always
passing
close
but
without
any
jar
or
collision
they
crept
into
the
mouths
of
the
tunnels
and
their
resemblance
was
really
perfect
to
the
wriggling
creatures
that
shelter
in
such
damp
clefts
and
caves
and
when
the
recalcitrant
mules
kicked
and
shied
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
it
was
easy
to
fancy
the
saurians
were
fighting
and
screaming
at
each
other
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
all
hundreds
of
men
were
tearing
up
the
earth
with
picks
inch
by
inch
to
win
the
hidden
treasure
these
were
the
sculptors
of
the
strange
and
enormous
figures
which
stood
in
awful
gravity
and
silence
to
confront
the
man
who
should
venture
to
invade
their
mysterious
domain
the
miners
hewed
down
here
bored
holes
there
dug
farther
on

one
place
scraped
down
the
wall
in
another
broke
up
the
limestone
chipped
out
the
pretty
flakes
of
mica
and
shale
pounded
down
the
calcareous
clay

the
hematite
and
pyrites
crushed
the
fine
white
marble
rolling
and
stirring
it
incessantly
till
it
should
yield
zinc

for
zinc
may
be
called
the
silver
of
europe
which
being
a
metal
of
which
you
can
not
make
saucepans
is
destined
to
become
the
fount
of

and
civilization
is
it
not
on
zinc
that
belgium
has
hoisted
her
standard
of
moral
and
political
greatness
aye

has
its
epic
the
sky
was
clear
and
bright
the
sun
rose
unclouded
on
the
scene
and
the
wide
settlement
of
socartes
flashed
from
dark
neutrality
into
redness
the
sculptured
rocks
the
heaps
of
ore
the
hillocks
of
waste
soil
that
rose
on
every
side
like
babylonian
mounds
were
red
the
ground
the
trucks
and
carts
the
machinery
the
water
and
the
laborers
that
gave
life
to

the
tone
was
universal
with
faint
shades
of
difference
in
the
earth
and
the
houses
the
metal
and
the
people
garments
the
women
at
work
at
the
washing
looked
like
a
crowd
of
nymphs
come
down
in
the
world
and
cast
in
red
ironstone
a
rivulet
of
crimson
fluid
ran
through
the
bottom
conduit
to
join
a
crimson
river
you
might
fancy
it
the
sweat
of
these
toiling
men
and
machines
of
muscles
and
of
iron
nela
stepped
out
of
the
house
even
she
though
she
did
not
work
in
the
mines
was
faintly
tinged
with
the
universal
ruddle
for
the
metal
spared
no
one
in
her
hand
she
held
a
hunch
of
bread
which
se침ana
had
given
her
for
breakfast
and
as
she
ate
it
she
walked
on
quickly
lost
in
thought
and
not
lingering
to
amuse
herself
she
had
soon
passed
the
workshops
and
going
up
the
inclined
plane
and
the
steps
before
mentioned
she
reached
the
houses
of
aldeacorba
the
first
of
these
was
a
handsome
and
stately
mansion
large
and
cheerful
looking
but
lately
restored
and
painted
with
stone
boundary
walls
decorated
eaves
and
a
broad
escutcheon
surrounded
by
granite
foliage
and
the
escutcheon
itself
would
be
less
missed
than
the
climbing
vine
whose
long
and
leafy
branches
looked
like
whiskers
growing
as
whiskers
do
on
each
side
of
a
face
of
which
the
two
windows
served
as
eyes
while
the
escutcheon
was
the
nose
and
the
long
balcony
the
mouth
always
widely
grinning
and
to
complete
this
whimsical
air
of
personality
a
beam
stuck
out
from
the
balcony
intended
to
attach
a
rope
to
support
an
awning
and
with
this
addition
the
face
was
seen
as
smoking
a
cigar
the
roof
was
in
the
shape
of
a
cap
and
in
it
there
was
a
window
that
might
represent
the
tassel
the
chimneys
could
only
be
the
ears
it
was
one
of
those
faces
in
which
a
physiognomist
reads
plainly
peace
of
mind
ease
of
circumstance
and
a
quiet
conscience
in
front
of
it
was
a
little
enclosed
by
a
wall
of
adobe
and
on
one
side
was
a
pretty
orchard
as
nela
went
in
she
met
the
cows
coming
out
to
pasture
and
after
exchanging
a
few
words
with
their
driver
a
formidable
youth
about
four
feet
high
and
ten
years
old
she
went
straight
up
to
a
stout
gentleman
whiskered
and
florid
with
a
kind
face
and
pleasant
smile
and
a
and
air
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
braces
and
his
hairy
arms
were
bared
to
the
elbow
before
the
little
girl
addressed
him
he
looked
up
at
the
house
and
called
out
here
is
nela
my
boy
a
lad
at
once
made
his
appearance
remarkably
tall
grave
and
erect
his
head
held
somewhat
stiffly
and
his
eyes
fixed
and
vacant
like
lenses
his
face
was
like
marble
carved
with
exquisite
sharpness
and
his
skin
was
as
fine
and
soft
as
a
girl
there
was
not
a
feature
or
a
line
which
was
not
of
that
supremely
beautiful
type
of
manliness
which
was
the
outcome
of
a
thousand
years
of
hellenic
thought
those
eyes
even
so
purely
sculpturesque
in
their
lack
of
sight
were
large
grand
and
brilliant
their
fixity
lost
its
strangeness
when
you
remembered
that
behind
them
all
was
night
in
the
absence
of
the
faculty
which
is
the
cause
and
origin
of
facial
expression
this
blind
antinous
had
the
cold
serenity
of
marble
endowed
with
form
by
the
genius
of
sculpture
and
with
life
by
a
vital
spark
a
breath
a
ray
of
warmth
a
mere
sensation
would
suffice
to
animate
the
beautiful
stone
which
while
it
possessed
every
charm
of
form
was
devoid
of
that
consciousness
of
its
own
beauty
which
is
born
of
the
faculty
of
seeing
it
he
looked
about
twenty
and
his
strong
and
graceful
frame
was
in
every
respect
worthy
of
the
incomparable
head
that
crowned
it
never
was
a
more
lamentable
injustice
done
by
nature
than
to
this
perfect
example
of
humanity
as
to
beauty
blest
on
one
hand
with
every
gift
and
bereft
on
the
other
of
the
sense
by
which
man
has
most
in
common
with
his
and
gains
familiarity
with
all
the
marvels
of
creation
at
large
the
injustice
was
such
that
these
splendid
gifts
were
useless
it
was
as
though
after
creating
all
things
the
creator
had
left
them
in
darkness
so
that
he
could
not
himself
take
pleasure
in
his
works
and
to
make
the
privation
more
conspicuous
the
young
man
had
mental
lights
of
the
highest
order
and
a
very
superior
intelligence
to
have
this
and
to
lack
the
faculty
of
conceiving
the
idea
of
visibility
of
form
as
distinct
from
mere
matter
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
to
have
all
the
faculties
of
a
man
and
be
as
blind
as
a
vegetable
it
was
strange
and
hard
we
alas
know
not
the
secret
of
these
terrible
injustices
if
we
did
then
indeed
the
gates
would
be
open
to
us
which
hide
the
primordial
secrets
of
moral
and
physical
duty
we
should
understand
the
fathomless
mysteries
of
inherited
woe
of
evil
and
of
death

take

of

dark

all
that

it

as

pleasure

and
danced
round
them
leaping
with
delight
and
sharing
his
caresses
with
great
impartiality
between
his
master
and
his
guide
nela
said
pablo
it
is
a
lovely
day
the
air
is
soft
and
fresh
and
the
sun
warm
without
being
scorching
where
shall
we
go
let
us
go
straight
on
through
the
meadows
replied
nela
poking
her
hand
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
lad
coat
what
have
you
brought
me
search
and
you
will
find
said
pablo
laughing
ah
holy
virgin
chocolate
how
i
love
chocolate
nuts
and
something
done
up
in
paper
what
is
it
oh
blessed
virgin
a
sweetie
do
not
i
like
sweeties
how
rich
i
am
we
do
not
have
such
good
things
to
eat
at
home
pablo
there
is
no
luxury
in
our
food
there
is
no
luxury
in
our
clothes
either
to
be
sure
in
fact
no
luxury
of
any
sort
where
shall
we
go
repeated
the
blind
lad
wherever
you
like
child
of
my
heart
replied
nela
eating
the
and
tearing
up
the
paper
it
had
been
wrapped
in
i
hear
and
obey
king
of
the
world
the
child
black
eyes
sparkled
with
happiness
her
sprightly
little
birdlike
face
smiled
and
wrinkled
with
satisfaction
and
was
not
still
for
an
instant
as
though
fitful
flashes
came
and
went
there
like
dimpling
light
on
wavelets
in
a
pool
this
helpless
little
creature
whose
spirit
seemed
imprisoned
and
confined
in
the
feeble
body
expanded
and
rose
elastic
when
she
was
alone
with
her
master
and
friend
with
him
she
at
once
became
original
bright
and
intelligent
she
had
feeling
grace
refinement
and
fancy
when
she
left
him
the
dark
doors
of
a
prison
seemed
to
close
on
her
once
more
but
i
tell
you
we
will
go
wherever
you
like
remarked
the
blind
youth
i
like
to
do
what
you
like
if
you
wish
we
will
go
to
the
clump
of
trees
beyond
saldeoro
but
just
as
you
like
yes
yes
delightful
exclaimed
nela
clapping
her
hands
and
as
there
is
no
hurry
we
can
sit
down
whenever
we
are
tired
there
is
a
nice
place
near
the
spring
do
you
remember
nela
and
there
are
some
large
which
seem
to
have
been
left
there
on
purpose
for
us
to
sit
upon
and
we
hear
so
many
many
birds
singing
that
it
is
quite
glorious
and
we
can
go
past
the
that
you
say
talks
and
mumbles
the
words
out
like
a
tipsy
man
oh
what
a
lovely
day
and
how
happy
i
am
is
the
sun
very
bright
nela
though
if
you
say
i
shall
be
none
the
wiser
since
has
no
meaning
for
me
it
is
very
bright
indeed
but
what
does
it
matter
that
you
can
not
see
it
the
sun
is
not
at
all
pretty
you
can
not
look
in
its
face
why
not
because
it
hurts
hurts
what
hurts
the
eyes
how
do
you
feel
when
you
are
happy
when
i
am
out
with
you
just
we
two
together
in
the
fields
yes
oh
i
feel
inside
me
a
sort
of
freshness
a
springing
up
of
something
sweet
and
soothing
that
is
just
it
now
you
know
how
the
sun
shines
bright
what
with
freshness
no
no
silly
boy
what
then
oh
like
that
like
that
but
what
is
that
like
that
nela
insisted
again
i
see
it
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
explained
in
words
do
you
know
i
used
to
have
a
notion
of
day
and
of
night
it
was
daytime
when
people
talked
it
was
night
when
people
were
silent
and
the
cocks
crowed
now
i
estimate
it
differently
it
is
day
when
you
and
i
are
together
and
it
is
night
when
we
are
apart
ah
holy
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
shaking
back
the
that
hung
over
her
to
me
who
can
see
it
is
exactly
the
same
i
mean
to
ask
my
father
to
let
you
come
and
live
in
our
house
so
that
i
may
always
have
you
with
me
good
good
cried
marianela
clapping
her
hands
once
more
and
as
she
spoke
she
skipped
on
a
little
way
in
front
and
picking
up
her
skirts
with
a
great
deal
of
grace
began
to
dance
what
are
you
about
asked
the
blind
boy
child
of
my
heart
i
am
dancing
i
felt
so
happy
that
i
thought
i
must
dance
however
they
now
had
to
get
over
a
little
fence
and
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
after
surmounting
this
obstacle
they
went
along
a
lane
hedged
in
on
each
side
by
luxuriant
ivy
and
brambles
nela
held
the
branches
back
that
they
might
not
scratch
her
companion
face
and
at
last
after
going
for
a
considerable
time
they
went
up
a
slope
shaded
by
chestnut
and
walnut
trees
when
they
had
reached
the
top
pablo
said
if
you
do
not
mind
we
will
sit
down
here
i
hear
some
people
going
past
they
are
the
people
returning
from
the
market
at
homedes
is
wednesday
the
runs
just
below
and
we
can
rest
here
before
going
on
it
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
choto
come
here
the
trio
seated
themselves
the
place
is
full
of
flowers
said
nela
what
beauties
pick
me
some
though
i
can
not
see
them
i
like
to
hold
them
in
my
hand
i
fancy
i
can
hear
them
here
are
some
lovely
ones
as
i
hold
them
in
my
hand
i
fancy
that
they
make
me
feel
and
understand
i
can
not
tell
you
how
that
they
are
pretty
and
gay
there
is
something
inside
me
that
they
seem
to
belong
to
and
that
answers
to
them
do
you
know
nela
i
fancy
that
i
can
really
see
inside
as
it
were
oh
yes
i
quite
understand
we
have
everything
inside
us
there
the
sun
the
flowers
the
moon
and
wide
blue
sky
with
all
the
stars
we
have
them
all
there
i
mean
that
besides
all
the
beautiful
things
outside
us
and
around
us
we
carry
others
with
us
in
our
minds
here
you
have
a
flower
and
another
and
another
six
all
quite
different
now
what
do
you
think
flowers
are
flowers
said
the
blind
youth
puzzled
and
lifting
them
to
his
face
flowers
are
i
fancy
as
if
the
earth
smiled
but
in
truth
i
know
very
little
about
plants
and
flowers
merciful
mother
what
terrible
ignorance
cried
nela
stroking
her
friend
hands
flowers
are
the
stars
of
the
earth
what
an
extravagant
fancy
and
what
are
the
stars
then
the
stars
are
the
eyes
of
those
who
have
gone
to
heaven
and
look
down
on
us
well
but
then
the
flowers
are
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
dead
and
have
not
gone
straight
to
heaven
said
the
girl
with
all
the
decision
and
conviction
of
a
doctor
of
theology
the
dead
are
buried
in
the
ground
but
as
they
can
not
lie
still
there
without
just
peeping
out
at
the
world
they
put
forth
something
which
takes
the
form
of
a
flower
when
in
a
field
there
are
many
many
flowers
it
is
because
once
upon
a
time
long
ago
a
great
many
people
were
buried
there
no
no
said
pablo
very
seriously
do
not
believe
such
nonsense
our
holy
religion
teaches
us
that
the
spirit
quits
the
flesh
and
that
our
mortal
life
comes
to
an
end
what
is
buried
nela
is
a
mere
shell
of
useless
clay
which
can
neither
think
nor
feel
nor
even
see
the
books
say
so
but
se침ana
says
that
books
are
full
of
lies
but
faith
and
reason
say
so
too
dear
nela
your
imagination
makes
you
believe
a
number
of
foolish
things
but
by
degrees
i
will
show
you
your
errors
and
you
will
have
true
and
right
ideas
about
everything
in
this
world
and
the
other
aye
aye
i
know
lessons
at
three
for
a
penny
and
you
wanted
to
make
me
believe
that
the
sun
stands
still
and
the
earth
spins
round
and
round
it
how
can
you
know
you
who
can
not
see
merciful
heaven
may
i
die
on
the
spot
if
the
earth
is
not
as
steady
as
a
rock
and
the
sun
running
on
i
do
not
set
up
for
learning
but
i
have
spent
many
hours
of
the
day
and
night
in
looking
at
the
sky
and
i
know
how
the
machine
the
earth
is
below
and
full
of
islands
some
large
and
some
small
the
sun
comes
up
on
this
side
and
goes
down
out
there
it
is
god
almighty
palace
foolish
child
but
why
not
ah
you
have
never
seen
a
fine
day
and
clear
sky
why
child
you
could
fancy
blessing
was
dropping
down
from
it
i
do
not
think
there
could
be
wicked
people
nobody
could
be
wicked
if
they
would
only
turn
up
their
faces
and
see
the
great
eye
that
looks
down
upon
us
your
religion
is
full
of
superstition
my
little
nela
i
will
teach
you
something
better
nobody
has
taught
me
anything
said
mar칤a
very
simply
but
i
myself
whoever
may
object
have
found
out
in
my
own
head
a
great
many
ideas
that
comfort
me
and
so
when
a
good
idea
occurs
to
me
i
say
course
it
must
be
so
it
can
not
be
otherwise
at
night
when
i
am
alone
at
home
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
us
when
we
die
and
i
think
how
much
the
holy
virgin
loves
us
yes
she
is
our
loving
mother
and
i
look
up
at
the
sky
and
i
feel
her
close
over
my
head
just
as
when
you
go
up
to
any
one
you
feel
the
warmth
of
their
breath
she
looks
at
us
night
and
day
through
all
the
lovely
things
there
are
in
the
world
do
not
laugh
at
me
those
lovely
things
are
her
eyes
of
course
oh
you
would
understand
it
if
you
had
eyes
yourself
you
have
not
seen
a
white
cloud
a
tree
a
flower
running
water
a
little
child
a
little
lamb
the
sparkling
dew
the
moon
sailing
across
the
sky
and
the
stars
which
are
the
eyes
of
the
good
men
who
are
dead
they
would
not
want
to
go
up
there
if
they
lie
under
the
ground
throwing
out
flowers
only
hear
this
fellow
why
they
stay
down
there
only
till
they
are
purified
of
sin
and
then
they
mount
and
fly
up
there
yes
i
believe
it
simpleton
why
what
can
the
stars
be
if
they
are
not
the
souls
of
those
who
are
saved
do
not
you
know
that
stars
sometimes
come
down
i
i
myself
have
seen
them
fall
down
down
leaving
a
ray
of
light
behind
them
yes
se침or
the
stars
come
down
when
they
have
something
to
tell
us
here
below
oh
nela
pablo
exclaimed
eagerly
your
wild
imaginings
absurd
as
they
are
charm
and
captivate
me
for
they
betray
the
innocence
of
your
soul
and
the
strength
of
your
fancy
all
your
errors
even
are
part
of
an
earnest
disposition
to
know
the
truth
and
of
great
gifts
which
would
be
very
superior
talents
if
they
were
cultivated
by
reason
and
education
you
must
acquire
one
precious
accomplishment
of
which
i
am
deprived
you
must
positively
learn
to
read
to
read
and
who
is
to
teach
me
my
father
will
i
will
ask
him
to
teach
you
you
know
he
never
refuses
me
anything
what
a
pity
it
is
you
should
live
in
such
a
wretched
way
your
mind
is
a
mine
of
treasures
you
are
goodness
and
sweetness
itself
and
have
a
lovely
imagination
god
has
given
you
a
large
share
of
all
the
gifts
that
are
in
his
store
and
part
of
himself
i
know
it
well
i
can
not
see
what
is
outside
but
i
can
see
within
and
i
know
all
the
wonders
of
your
spirit
that
you
have
shown
me
since
you
have
been
my
it
is
a
year
and
a
half
now
and
it
seems
like
yesterday
that
we
first
began
our
walks
together
and
yet
no
i
have
known
you
a
thousand
years
how
is
it
that
there
is
such
a
close
relationship
between
your
feelings
and
mine
just
now
for
instance
you
have
talked
all
sorts
of
extravagant
nonsense
and
i
who
know
the
truth
about
the
world
and
religion
i
was
stirred
to
enthusiasm
as
i
listened
to
you
i
feel
as
if
it
were
a
voice
speaking
in
my
own
heart
holy
mother
exclaimed
the
girl
folding
her
hands
and
can
he
see
something
else
that
i
feel
what
is
that
that
i
was
put
into
the
world
expressly
to
be
your
and
that
my
eyes
would
be
of
no
use
at
all
if
it
were
not
to
guide
you
and
to
tell
you
how
beautiful
the
world
is
the
blind
boy
turned
his
head
suddenly
and
eagerly
and
putting
out
his
hands
to
touch
the
child
by
his
side
he
said
anxiously
tell
me
nela
what
are
you
like
but
nela
did
not
answer
the
question
was
a
stab
to
her
heart
chapter
vii
more
absurdities
by
this
time
they
were
rested
and
they
went
on
till
they
reached
the
beginning
of
the
grove
beyond
saldeoro
here
they
turned
off
into
a
clump
of
ancient
walnut
trees
of
which
the
trunks
and
roots
made
a
sort
of
in
the
soil
with
mossy
hollows
and
backs
so
perfect
for
seats
that
the
hand
of
man
could
have
made
no
better
from
the
top
of
the
slope
trickled
a
thread
of
water
tumbling
from
stone
to
stone
till
it
fell
exhausted
into
a
little
basin
constructed
to
be
a
reservoir
to
feed
the
conduit
by
which
the
neighboring
houses
were
supplied
before
them
the
land
sloped
gently
away
affording
a
lovely
panorama
of
green
hills
with
scattered
groves
and
villas
and
meadow
plains
where
hundreds
of
cattle
grazed
and
wandered
peacefully
quite
in
the
background
between
two
lofty
heights
which
were
the
farthest
limit
of
the
land
lay
a
wide
segment
of
purely
blue
sea
it
was
such
a
landscape
as
makes
a
man
feel
to
the
utmost
his
relations
to
infinity
and
eternity
pablo
had
seated
himself
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
resting
his
left
arm
on
the
edge
of
the
basin
with
his
right
hand
he
pulled
at
the
boughs
which
hung
low
enough
to
touch
his
forehead
on
which
now
and
again
the
sunbeams
played
as
the
boughs
stirred
what
are
you
doing
nela
asked
he
after
a
pause
not
hearing
the
steps
the
voice
nor
even
the
breathing
of
his
companion
what
are
you
about
and
where
are
you
here
i
am
said
nela
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
was
looking
at
the
sea
ah
it
must
be
a
long
way
off
it
is
visible
between
the
hills
of
fic칩briga
very
large
immensely
large
so
wide
that
you
might
look
all
day
and
not
have
done
looking
is
it
not
there
is
only
a
piece
to
be
seen
from
here
like
the
bit
you
cut
off
with
your
teeth
when
you
put
a
slice
of
bread
in
your
mouth
yes
yes
i
understand
every
one
says
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
beautiful
as
the
sea
because
it
is
so
grandly
listen
nela
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
but
what
are
you
doing
nela
had
grasped
a
bough
of
the
tree
with
both
hands
and
was
swinging
by
it
lightly
and
gracefully
here
i
am
i
was
wondering
why
god
should
not
give
us
human
creatures
wings
to
fly
like
birds
how
delightful
it
would
be
just
to
give
a
flap
and
a
whisk
and
up
we
should
go
and
in
one
flight
we
should
be
at
the
top
of
that
peak
between
fic칩briga
and
the
sea
but
though
god
has
not
given
us
wings
he
has
given
us
thought
instead
which
flies
faster
than
any
bird
since
it
can
fly
up
to
god
tell
me
child
of
what
good
would
wings
be
to
me
if
god
had
denied
me
the
gift
of
thought
but
i
should
like
to
have
both
and
if
i
had
wings
i
would
pick
you
up
in
my
little
beak
to
take
you
out
of
this
world
and
carry
you
up
ever
so
much
higher
than
the
clouds
the
blind
lad
put
out
his
hand
to
stroke
nela
hair
sit
down
by
me
are
you
not
tired
just
a
little
she
said
sitting
down
and
laying
her
head
with
childlike
confidence
on
her
master
shoulder
you
are
breathing
fast
nelilla
you
are
very
tired
it
is
with
trying
to
well
what
i
want
to
say
to
you
is
this
talking
of
the
sea
put
me
in
mind
of
a
thing
my
father
read
to
me
last
night
you
know
that
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
my
father
has
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
me
every
evening
different
books
of
science
or
history
or
art
or
mere
amusement
i
might
say
that
these
readings
make
up
all
i
know
of
life
the
lord
to
compensate
me
for
being
blind
has
given
me
a
very
good
memory
and
it
has
turned
these
readings
to
good
account
for
though
there
has
been
no
regular
method
in
them
i
have
contrived
to
put
some
order
into
the
ideas
that
have
penetrated
to
my
understanding
how
i
have
enjoyed
listening
and
learning
about
the
admirable
laws
and
order
of
the
universe
the
harmonious
circling
of
the
stars
the
motion
of
atoms
and
above
all
those
grand
principles
which
govern
our
souls
and
minds
i
have
enjoyed
history
too
which
is
a
true
account
of
all
the
things
men
have
done
in
former
times
for
though
my
child
they
have
always
done
the
same
wicked
and
foolish
things
they
have
nevertheless
gone
on
improving
some
of
them
doing
their
utmost
but
without
ever
succeeding
to
attain
that
perfection
which
belongs
to
god
alone
and
finally
my
father
has
read
me
some
deeper
and
more
mysterious
things
that
can
not
be
understood
at
once
but
when
they
are
thought
over
and
considered
they
occupy
and
charm
the
mind
he
does
not
enjoy
that
sort
of
reading
very
much
as
he
does
not
altogether
follow
it
and
it
has
tired
me
sometimes
while
at
other
times
it
has
delighted
me
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
you
have
an
author
who
explains
himself
clearly
such
subjects
are
very
interesting
they
deal
with
cause
and
effect
the
rationale
of
all
we
think
and
how
we
think
and
teach
us
about
the
essential
nature
of
things
nela
did
not
seem
to
understand
a
single
word
of
what
her
friend
was
saying
but
she
listened
attentively
with
her
mouth
wide
open
to
inhale
if
possible
the
essences
and
causes
of
which
her
master
was
discoursing
opening
her
beak
like
a
bird
watching
the
movements
of
a
fly
he
wants
to
catch
well
then
he
went
on
last
night
he
was
reading
me
some
pages
about
beauty
the
author
in
discussing
beauty
said
that
it
was
the
outcome
and
radiance
of
goodness
and
truth
with
many
other
ingenious
comparisons
so
well
thought
out
and
expressed
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
listen
and
was
that
book
said
nela
anxious
to
prove
herself
equal
to
the
occasion
like
one
father
centeno
has
thousand
and
i
know
how
many
no
no
it
is
a
book
on
beauty
in
the
abstract
you
will
not
understand
on
ideal
beauty
and
yet
you
must
understand
that
there
is
a
sort
of
beauty
which
can
not
be
seen
nor
touched
nor
perceived
by
any
of
our
senses
for
example
like
the
virgin
mary
interrupted
nela
whom
we
can
not
see
nor
touch
because
her
pictures
are
not
herself
but
only
her
likeness
you
are
quite
right
it
is
just
like
that
thinking
over
this
my
father
shut
the
book
and
talked
of
one
thing
and
another
we
spoke
then
of
beauty
of
form
and
my
father
said
unfortunately
you
can
never
understand
but
i
said
i
could
i
said
that
there
could
only
be
one
type
and
that
would
apply
to
all
nela
caring
little
enough
for
such
subtleties
had
taken
the
flowers
out
of
her
companion
hands
and
was
arranging
their
colors
to
her
taste
i
have
a
clear
idea
about
this
the
blind
lad
went
on
vehemently
an
idea
that
i
have
been
quite
in
love
with
for
some
months
yes
i
am
sure
quite
sure
of
it
i
want
no
eyes
to
see
that
and
i
said
to
my
father
i
have
an
ideal
of
enchanting
beauty
a
type
which
includes
every
possible
perfection
and
that
type
is
nela
my
father
began
to
laugh
and
said
nela
turned
as
scarlet
as
a
poppy
and
could
not
answer
a
word
during
a
short
spasm
of
terror
and
pain
she
felt
as
if
the
blind
boy
were
looking
at
her
yes
you
are
the
most
perfect
beauty
imaginable
pablo
went
on
eagerly
how
could
it
be
possible
that
your
goodness
and
innocence
and
freshness
and
grace
your
imagination
your
sweet
and
lovely
soul
which
have
all
combined
to
enliven
and
comfort
my
dark
and
melancholy
life
how
i
say
could
it
be
possible
that
they
should
not
be
embodied
in
a
person
as
lovely
nela
nela
and
his
voice
trembled
with
tell
me
are
you
not
beautiful
very
pretty
nela
was
silent
she
instinctively
put
her
hands
up
and
stuck
into
her
hair
some
of
the
flowers
she
had
gathered
in
the
meadows
you
will
not
say
you
are
modest
indeed
if
you
were
not
you
would
not
be
the
sweet
little
soul
that
you
are
the
logic
of
beauty
would
be
at
fault
and
that
can
not
be
you
do
not
answer
i
murmured
nela
timidly
not
ceasing
her
occupation
i
do
not
know
they
say
that
i
was
very
pretty
as
a
baby
but
now
you
are
still
mar칤a
in
her
utter
confusion
could
only
say
now
well
you
know
that
people
talk
nonsense
and
make
stupid
mistakes
sometimes
those
who
have
eyes
see
least
yes
indeed
well
said
come
here
and
kiss
me
nela
did
not
instantly
obey
for
having
succeeded
in
fixing
a
sort
of
garland
of
flowers
in
her
hair
she
now
felt
an
eager
wish
to
see
the
effect
of
the
adornment
in
the
clear
mirror
of
the
reservoir
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
an
impulse
of
vanity
and
leaning
on
her
hands
she
bent
over
the
basin
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
blind
lad
i
am
looking
at
myself
in
the
water
which
is
just
like
a
she
replied
confessing
her
vanity
with
perfect
simplicity
you
need
not
do
that
you
are
as
lovely
as
the
angels
round
the
throne
of
god
he
had
fired
himself
with
enthusiastic
imaginings
the
water
is
ruffled
now
said
the
girl
and
i
can
not
see
myself
plainly
it
is
trembling
as
much
as
i
am
there
now
it
is
quieter
now
it
is
still
i
can
see
myself
now
very
well
and
see
how
pretty
you
are
come
here
my
child
added
the
blind
youth
holding
out
his
arms
i
pretty
she
said
in
anxious
confusion
well
what
i
see
in
the
pool
is
not
so
ugly
as
they
say
the
fact
is
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
do
not
know
how
to
see
aye
a
great
many
if
only
i
were
dressed
as
other
girls
are
exclaimed
nela
with
a
touch
of
pride
you
shall
be
and
the
book
said
i
was
beautiful
asked
nela
appealing
to
every
source
of
conviction
i
say
so
and
i
always
speak
the
truth
cried
the
boy
carried
away
by
his
eager
imagination
maybe
it
is
so
said
nela
moving
away
from
her
not
too
flattering
contemplation
maybe
that
men
are
very
stupid
and
do
not
see
things
as
they
really
are
human
nature
is
liable
to
a
thousand
errors
i
do
believe
it
said
mariquilla
greatly
comforted
by
her
words
what
can
they
see
to
laugh
at
in
me
oh
how
miserable
is
the
lot
of
man
cried
the
blind
boy
driven
to
wild
absurdity
by
his
raving
fancy
the
gift
of
sight
may
lead
him
into
many
errors
may
betray
him
into
a
misapprehension
of
abstract
truth
and
abstract
truth
proves
that
you
are
beautiful
without
any
stain
or
blemish
of
ugliness
if
any
one
tells
me
the
contrary
i
will
give
him
the
lie
away
with
their
theories
of
form
oh
fool
into
what
sins
your
eyes
may
mislead
you
nela
come
here
i
want
to
have
you
by
my
side
and
kiss
your
beloved
head
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
sweet
lovely
darling
he
exclaimed
clasping
her
passionately
to
his
breast
with
all
my
soul
i
love
you
nela
did
not
speak
her
heart
was
full
of
innocent
and
tender
devotion
overflowing
with
pure
delight
the
youth
trembling
and
throbbing
held
her
more
closely
than
ever
saying
i
love
you
more
than
my
life
angel
of
god
love
me
too
or
i
shall
die
mar칤a
freed
herself
from
his
embrace
and
he
remained
lost
in
bewilderment
she
the
tiny
woman
felt
an
overwhelming
and
irresistible
impulse
to
look
at
her
face
once
more
in
the
water
she
gently
stole
up
to
the
edge
and
there
against
the
green
background
she
saw
the
insignificant
little
face
with
its
black
eyes
its
dull
coloring
its
sharp
nose
not
altogether
ugly
that
nose
the
short
unkempt
hair
and
the
birdlike
eager
expression
she
leaned
farther
over
the
stone
brim
to
see
her
body
it
was
pitiably
made
and
mean
the
flowers
in
her
hair
fell
into
the
water
making
circles
in
it
and
the
image
wavered
she
poor
child
felt
as
if
her
heart
were
being
torn
up
by
the
roots
and
she
staggered
backwards
murmuring
mother
of
god
how
hideous
i
am
what
are
you
saying
nela
i
thought
you
spoke
i
did
not
say
anything
son
of
my
i
was
only
yes
it
is
high
time
we
should
turn
homewards
it
will
soon
be
well
come
along
you
shall
dine
with
me
and
we
will
go
out
again
give
me
your
hand
i
will
not
have
you
leave
me
when
they
reached
home
don
francisco
was
in
the
forecourt
with
two
other
gentlemen
marianela
recognized
the
engineer
of
the
mines
and
the
stranger
who
had
lost
his
way
in
la
terrible
the
night
before
here
are
the
said
she
and
his
brother
the
gentleman
of
last
evening
all
three
men
gazed
with
evident
interest
at
the
blind
youth
as
he
approached
we
have
been
expecting
you
some
time
my
son
said
the
father
taking
his
hand
and
introducing
him
to
the
doctor
let
us
go
indoors
said
the
engineer
blessings
on
all
men
of
science
with
good
hearts
exclaimed
don
francisco
turning
to
the
doctor
walk
in
gentlemen
happy
is
the
hour
when
you
enter
my
house
now
let
us
study
the
case
murmured
golfin
when
pablo
and
the
two
visitors
had
gone
in
don
francisco
turned
to
mariquilla
who
was
standing
transfixed
and
doubtful
in
the
middle
of
the
and
said
kindly
you
see
nela
you
may
as
well
go
home
my
son
will
not
be
able
to
go
out
this
afternoon
and
then
seeing
that
still
she
did
not
move
he
added
you
may
run
round
to
the
kitchen
dorotea
will
give
you
something
nice
chapter
viii
and
yet
more
the
following
day
pablo
and
his
guide
set
out
at
the
same
hour
but
as
the
sky
was
overcast
and
a
disagreeable
breeze
was
blowing
which
threatened
to
become
a
gale
they
decided
on
making
their
walk
a
short
one
crossing
the
village
green
of
aldeacorba
they
went
along
the
great
slope
above
the
mines
to
the
west
intending
to
go
down
into
the
excavations
nela
i
must
tell
you
something
that
will
make
you
leap
with
joy
said
the
blind
lad
when
they
were
at
some
distance
from
the
house
my
heart
is
bursting
with
i
feel
as
if
the
whole
universe
all
the
sciences
history
philosophy
natural
history
all
that
i
have
ever
learnt
had
got
inside
me
and
was
dancing
in
procession
you
saw
those
two
gentlemen
who
were
waiting
for
me
yesterday
don
c치rlos
and
his
brother
he
is
a
famous
doctor
who
has
been
all
over
america
making
wonderful
he
is
come
to
see
his
brother
and
as
don
c치rlos
is
a
great
friend
of
my
father
he
asked
his
brother
to
examine
me
how
kind
and
gentle
he
is
first
he
sat
talking
to
me
he
asked
me
a
number
of
questions
and
told
me
all
sorts
of
pleasant
and
amusing
stories
then
he
told
me
to
sit
quite
still
i
felt
his
fingers
on
my
eyelids
and
after
a
long
time
he
said
something
i
did
not
understand
medical
terms
and
my
father
never
read
me
anything
about
medicine
then
he
led
me
close
to
the
window
and
while
he
examined
my
eyes
with
some
instrument
the
room
was
as
then
he
said
to
my
father
it
is
worth
trying
they
said
more
but
in
a
low
voice
that
i
might
not
hear
and
i
think
they
talked
partly
by
signs
when
the
visitors
were
gone
my
father
said
to
me
of
my
soul
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
the
joy
that
is
in
me
this
man
this
angel
from
heaven
has
given
me
a
hope
a
very
faint
hope
but
we
cling
most
to
a
hope
when
it
is
smallest
i
try
to
give
it
up
by
telling
myself
it
is
impossible
no
almost
impossible
but
it
sticks
to
me
like
a
burr
this
was
what
my
father
said
and
i
could
hear
in
his
voice
that
he
was
crying
what
are
you
doing
nela
are
you
dancing
here
i
am
close
to
you
but
you
used
to
dance
when
i
told
you
anything
that
made
me
happy
where
shall
we
go
it
is
a
dull
day
we
will
go
as
far
as
trascava
that
is
a
sheltered
spot
and
then
go
down
into
la
terrible
very
well
just
as
you
oh
nela
if
only
it
could
be
true
if
god
would
have
pity
on
me
and
grant
me
the
joy
of
seeing
you
even
if
i
could
only
see
for
one
day
and
were
blind
again
the
next
how
i
would
thank
him
nela
said
nothing
after
feeling
at
first
intensely
happy
she
now
walked
on
thoughtfully
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
many
wonderful
things
happen
in
the
world
pablo
went
on
and
mercy
works
in
strange
ways
strikes
as
suddenly
as
his
wrath
it
comes
upon
us
unexpectedly
after
long
punishment
and
torment
just
as
his
anger
falls
on
us
in
the
midst
of
happiness
which
has
seemed
secure
and
eternal
do
you
not
think
so
yes
what
you
hope
will
be
accomplished
how
do
you
know
my
heart
tells
me
so
your
heart
tells
you
and
why
should
not
such
warnings
come
true
cried
pablo
fervently
yes
such
chosen
souls
as
yours
can
in
some
cases
foresee
the
issue
i
have
noticed
it
in
myself
for
as
i
am
not
diverted
from
by
seeing
things
outside
me
i
have
perceived
sometimes
that
i
had
a
whispered
presentiment
that
was
quite
inexplicable
then
when
some
event
or
other
has
come
to
pass
i
have
said
to
myself
with
astonishment
knew
all
this
beforehand
the
same
thing
happens
to
me
replied
nela
yesterday
you
told
me
you
loved
me
dearly
and
when
i
got
home
i
said
to
myself
is
very
strange
but
i
knew
something
of
this
it
is
wonderful
dear
little
one
how
perfectly
our
souls
are
one
united
by
our
own
wish
and
will
nothing
is
wanting
but
a
bond
of
union
that
bond
shall
be
tied
if
i
really
gain
the
precious
sense
that
i
have
never
enjoyed
the
idea
of
seeing
would
never
have
taken
possession
of
my
mind
if
i
did
not
cherish
above
all
things
the
idea
that
through
it
i
should
love
you
better
the
acquisition
of
that
power
can
be
nothing
to
me
but
the
faculty
of
admiring
in
a
new
kind
of
way
what
i
already
admire
so
truly
by
the
way
of
but
i
fancy
you
are
sad
yes
i
am
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
why
i
am
very
happy
and
very
sad
both
at
once
the
day
is
so
gloomy
it
would
be
better
if
it
never
were
day
at
all
always
night
nay
nay
things
are
good
as
they
are
day
and
night
if
god
ever
grant
me
to
know
the
difference
how
happy
i
shall
be
why
are
you
stopping
we
have
come
to
a
dangerous
bit
we
must
turn
aside
a
little
way
to
get
to
the
path
ah
la
trascava
this
slippery
grass
slopes
down
till
it
is
lost
in
the
chasm
whatever
falls
down
there
does
not
come
up
again
let
us
go
away
nela
i
do
not
like
this
place
silly
boy
it
is
a
long
way
from
this
to
the
mouth
of
the
chasm
and
it
is
very
pretty
here
nela
stood
still
and
detained
her
companion
by
the
arm
looking
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
which
opened
in
the
earth
in
shape
like
a
funnel
the
sloping
sides
of
this
narrow
deep
basin
were
covered
by
extremely
fine
turf
at
the
very
bottom
a
large
oblong
rock
lay
on
the
grass
among
brambles
fennel
shrubs
and
rushes
and
an
immense
variety
of
flowers
the
stone
looked
like
a
large
tongue
you
felt
rather
than
saw
that
by
the
side
of
it
there
was
an
opening
an
abyss
hidden
by
plants
such
as
don
quixote
had
to
cut
away
when
he
slid
into
the
cavern
of
montesinos
nela
seemed
never
tired
of
looking
why
do
you
say
that
the
horrible
trascava
looks
pretty
asked
pablo
because
it
is
so
full
of
flowers
last
week
they
were
all
dead
and
over
but
now
they
have
bloomed
afresh
and
it
really
is
lovely
to
look
at
and
there
are
such
numbers
of
birds
there
and
of
butterflies
too
sucking
honey
from
the
flowers
choto
choto
come
here
do
not
frighten
the
poor
little
birds
the
dog
who
had
run
down
the
slope
came
galloping
back
at
call
and
the
fluttering
republic
of
birds
returned
to
take
possession
of
their
common
property
i
have
a
perfect
horror
of
the
place
said
pablo
pulling
the
arm
now
shall
we
go
as
far
as
the
mines
i
know
the
way
there
and
feel
on
my
own
ground
we
will
go
round
behind
el
choto
go
on
in
front
do
not
get
under
my
feet
they
went
down
a
path
cut
into
steps
and
soon
reached
the
basin
formed
by
digging
out
the
earth
and
leaving
the
zone
of
vegetation
they
suddenly
crossed
the
boundary
line
of
a
geological
zone
so
to
speak
an
enormous
trench
whose
sides
wrought
by
the
pick
and
shovel
displayed
an
interesting
section
of
stratification
where
the
different
layers
showed
the
greatest
variety
of
colors
and
earths
this
was
the
place
where
teodoro
golfin
had
fancied
himself
in
the
hull
of
a
wrecked
vessel
worn
away
by
the
waves
and
its
popular
name
the
ship
had
been
suggested
by
that
very
resemblance
by
day
however
the
spectator
was
chiefly
struck
by
the
sections
of
the
strata
with
their
sulphurous
and
carboniferous
veins
black
sedimentary
deposits
lignites
in
which
jet
frequently
occurred
streaks
of
ferruginous
earth
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
mixed
with
blood
and
large
even
layers
of
slate
split
in
a
thousand
places
by
human
devices
bristling
with
splinters
and
riven
into
fissures
and
clefts
looking
like
wounds
seen
through
a
strong
magnifier
while
a
thread
of
water
stained
with
oxide
of
iron
that
flowed
down
the
middle
might
be
taken
for
blood
where
is
our
seat
asked
the
young
man
let
us
go
there
we
shall
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
great
cutting
they
went
up
by
a
rough
that
had
been
made
between
broken
stones
and
earth
overgrown
with
rank
fennel
and
at
the
top
they
sat
down
under
the
shelter
of
an
enormous
crag
rent
across
the
middle
the
two
halves
of
the
rock
standing
opposite
each
other
with
their
jagged
faces
looked
for
all
the
world
like
two
yawning
jaws
trying
to
meet
and
close
how
pleasant
it
is
here
pablo
said
sometimes
there
is
a
disagreeable
draught
through
this
chasm
but
i
do
not
feel
it
what
we
hear
is
the
trickling
water
down
inside
the
bowels
of
la
trascava
it
is
very
quiet
observed
nela
would
you
like
to
lie
down
that
is
a
good
idea
last
night
i
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
all
my
father
had
said
to
me
of
the
doctor
of
my
all
night
i
felt
as
if
a
hand
went
into
my
eyes
and
opened
a
closed
and
door
as
he
spoke
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
and
laid
his
head
on
nela
knees
a
door
he
went
on
which
was
quite
in
my
inmost
feeling
opened
as
i
tell
you
showing
a
way
into
a
room
where
the
idea
that
haunts
me
was
shut
up
oh
nela
of
my
heart
best
beloved
idolized
darling
if
only
god
would
grant
me
the
sense
i
lack
then
i
should
think
myself
the
happiest
of
men
for
i
am
almost
that
already
merely
from
having
you
to
be
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
life
very
little
is
needed
to
make
us
two
one
nothing
but
to
see
you
and
rejoice
in
your
beauty
with
that
joy
in
seeing
which
i
can
not
even
comprehend
since
i
have
only
a
vague
conception
of
it
i
have
a
questioning
spirit
only
because
i
have
no
power
to
see
for
myself
i
fancy
it
will
be
like
a
new
way
of
loving
you
i
think
of
nothing
but
your
beauty
still
there
is
something
in
it
which
i
can
not
realize
as
my
own
hark
said
nela
suddenly
with
evident
interest
in
something
quite
distinct
from
what
her
friend
was
saying
do
not
you
hear
what
down
in
there
la
trascava
it
is
talking
superstitious
child
water
can
not
talk
my
nela
what
language
could
a
driblet
of
water
speak
there
are
but
two
things
which
speak
my
sweet
the
tongue
and
the
conscience
and
la
trascava
said
nela
turning
paler
it
is
a
whisper
only
yes
yes
it
says
and
sometimes
i
can
hear
my
mother
voice
saying
quite
plainly
little
girl
it
is
very
pleasant
down
here
it
is
all
your
fancy
well
fancy
talks
too
i
forgot
that
my
imagination
sometimes
chatters
so
fast
that
i
have
to
tell
it
to
be
silent
its
voice
is
loud
persistent
intolerable
that
of
conscience
is
deep
calm
convincing
there
is
no
answering
or
refuting
it
now
it
sounds
as
if
it
were
crying
said
nela
still
listening
to
the
bubbling
water
it
is
dying
away
little
by
little
suddenly
a
light
gust
came
up
from
the
chasm
there
it
sighed
deeply
did
not
you
hear
now
i
hear
the
voice
again
it
is
speaking
low
and
it
says
to
me
in
a
whisper
a
tiny
whisper
in
my
ear
well
what
does
it
say
nothing
said
mar칤a
shortly
after
a
pause
you
say
it
is
all
nonsense
you
may
be
right
i
will
get
all
these
absurd
ideas
out
of
your
head
said
the
blind
youth
taking
her
hand
we
are
going
to
live
together
all
our
lives
oh
heavenly
father
if
i
am
never
to
enjoy
the
blessing
of
which
thou
didst
deprive
me
at
my
birth
why
hast
thou
allowed
me
to
hope
hapless
wretch
that
i
am
if
i
am
not
born
anew
under
the
hands
of
doctor
golfin
a
new
birth
indeed
a
new
life
oh
my
darling
i
swear
to
you
by
the
image
of
god
that
exists
in
my
soul
glorious
real
and
immutable
that
you
and
i
will
never
part
by
my
will
i
shall
have
eyes
nela
eyes
to
delight
in
your
presence
and
then
i
will
marry
you
you
will
be
my
beloved
wife
life
of
my
life
and
the
joy
and
pride
of
my
and
do
you
say
nothing
to
this
even
nela
bent
her
head
down
over
the
lad
handsome
face
she
wished
to
speak
but
could
not
for
emotion
and
if
god
will
not
after
all
vouchsafe
me
this
mercy
added
pablo
still
you
will
not
leave
me
still
you
will
be
my
wife
unless
it
horrifies
you
to
think
of
marrying
a
blind
man
indeed
my
dearest
i
ought
not
to
inflict
such
a
burden
on
you
you
will
meet
some
good
man
who
will
love
you
and
who
will
make
you
happy
your
wonderful
kindness
your
noble
feelings
your
sweet
face
must
win
many
hearts
and
inspire
the
purest
love
in
all
who
have
to
do
with
you
your
future
can
not
fail
to
be
bright
and
happy
i
swear
to
you
that
i
shall
love
you
as
long
as
i
live
seeing
or
blind
i
devote
myself
to
you
before
god
in
the
fullest
most
perfect
and
most
unbounded
will
you
not
speak
to
me
nela
yes
i
love
you
dearly
very
very
dearly
said
nela
putting
her
face
close
to
his
but
do
not
be
anxious
to
see
me
perhaps
i
am
not
so
nice
as
you
fancy
as
she
spoke
nela
felt
in
her
pocket
and
brought
out
a
piece
of
silvered
glass
a
dull
and
useless
fragment
of
a
cheap
mirror
which
had
been
broken
a
week
since
in
the
centeno
household
in
this
she
looked
at
herself
the
image
was
all
awry
and
in
consequence
of
the
small
size
of
the
she
was
obliged
to
study
it
a
bit
at
a
time
first
one
eye
and
then
her
forehead
till
holding
it
farther
off
she
could
command
a
view
of
half
her
face
at
once
but
alas
the
result
of
her
investigations
was
sad
enough
as
she
looked
in
the
glass
the
tears
started
from
her
eyes
nela
i
felt
a
drop
on
my
forehead
it
is
raining
yes
my
child
it
seems
to
be
raining
said
nela
with
a
gulping
sob
no
you
are
something
in
my
heart
tells
me
so
you
are
goodness
itself
your
soul
and
mine
are
united
by
some
divine
and
mysterious
bond
they
can
never
be
parted
is
it
not
true
they
are
two
halves
of
one
are
they
not
quite
true
your
tears
give
me
a
plainer
answer
than
words
could
you
love
me
do
you
not
and
will
always
love
me
just
the
same
whether
i
recover
my
sight
or
remain
blind
the
same
just
the
same
cried
nela
vehemently
and
will
always
stay
with
me
always
then
listen
cried
the
blind
lad
in
passionate
rapture
if
i
had
to
choose
between
remaining
blind
and
losing
you
i
would
choose
you
would
choose
to
remain
blind
oh
merciful
mother
of
heaven
how
happy
how
happy
i
am
i
would
choose
not
to
see
your
sweet
face
with
these
eyes
for
i
can
see
it
in
my
soul
as
clearly
as
truth
you
live
here
in
my
heart
and
to
me
you
are
more
lovely
and
enchanting
than
anything
on
earth
oh
yes
yes
cried
nela
i
must
be
beautiful
i
must
be
lovely
listen
said
pablo
i
have
a
presentiment
a
sure
anticipation
it
is
as
though
the
voice
of
god
within
me
promised
me
that
i
should
have
my
sight
that
i
shall
see
you
that
we
shall
be
happy
do
you
not
feel
it
yourself
i
yes
i
feel
sure
you
will
see
i
shall
see
your
face
what
happiness
cried
the
blind
boy
in
the
ecstatic
tone
which
was
peculiar
to
him
in
moments
of
but
i
see
it
already
i
see
it
now
in
my
heart
as
plainly
as
the
truth
in
my
soul
yes
yes
oh
yes
nela
repeated
wildly
with
eyes
and
quivering
lips
it
is
true
i
am
i
must
be
beautiful
bless
you
sweet
one
and
you
she
said
gravely
kissing
his
forehead
now
are
you
not
sleepy
yes
i
am
beginning
to
be
sleepy
i
did
not
sleep
all
night
and
i
am
so
comfortable
here
then
sleep
my
child
and
she
began
to
sing
a
lullaby
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
asleep
but
nela
sat
listening
to
the
voice
of
la
trascava
which
said

chapter
ix
the
brothers
golfin
teodoro
golfin
did
not
waste
his
time
at
socartes
the
first
day
after
his
arrival
he
spent
several
hours
in
his
brother
laboratory
and
during
the
following
days
he
went
from
one
part
of
the
mines
to
another
examining
and
admiring
all
he
saw
here
the
awful
might
of
natural
forces
and
there
the
power
and
enterprise
of
human
skill
at
night
when
all
was
still
in
the
busy
village
and
nothing
was
awake
but
the
snorting
furnaces
the
worthy
doctor
who
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
listened
with
delight
to
his
piano
se침ora
sof칤a
was
don
c치rlos
wife
but
their
children
were
all
dead
the
two
brothers
were
devotedly
attached
to
each
other
born
in
the
humblest
rank
of
life
they
had
struggled
hard
in
early
youth
to
rise
above
ignorance
and
poverty
often
on
the
point
of
giving
way
to
the
difficulties
that
beset
them
but
the
impetus
of
manly
determination
was
so
strong
in
them
that
at
length
gasping
for
breath
they
reached
the
land
rising
superior
to
the
beating
waves
in
which
vulgar
souls
splash
and
struggle
in
a
perpetual
state
of
shipwreck
teodoro
who
was
the
eldest
was
a
medical
man
before
c치rlos
was
qualified
as
an
engineer
and
he
helped
him
to
the
utmost
so
long
as
the
younger
brother
needed
it
and
when
he
saw
him
fairly
started
he
took
the
step
to
which
his
enterprising
spirit
had
long
aspired
and
set
out
for
south
america
there
he
practised
with
other
celebrated
physicians
gaining
fame
and
wealth
after
a
short
visit
at
home
in
spain
he
returned
to
the
new
world
and
even
after
a
second
voyage
home
he
went
back
again
but
during
each
of
these
expeditions
he
made
a
short
tour
in
europe
to
avail
himself
of
the
advances
made
in
ophthalmic
science
which
he
particularly
cultivated
he
was
a
man
of
unpolished
manners
dark
and
with
an
expression
at
once
intelligent
and
sensual
his
lips
were
thick
his
skin
opaque
and
hairy
his
eyes
bright
and
keen
his
frame
was
robust
and
his
constitution
sound
though
somewhat
injured
by
the
south
american
climate
his
large
round
face
his
prominent
brow
his
short
rebellious
hair
the
flash
of
his
eyes
and
his
thick
square
hands
had
led
to
his
being
spoken
of
as
the
black
lion
in
truth
he
was
like
a
lion
and
like
the
king
of
beasts
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
asserting
the
estimation
in
which
he
held
himself
however
this
vanity
of
a
really
distinguished
man
was
the
most
pardonable
of
vanities
for
it
consisted
chiefly
in
his
persistently
displaying
his
two
great
titles
of
fame
and
honor
namely
his
devotion
to
surgery
and
the
lowness
of
his
origin
he
spoke
incorrectly
from
his
utter
inability
to
elaborate
phrases
with
ease
and
elegance
his
rapid
and
broken
sentences
followed
the
course
of
his
ideas
which
were
as
swift
as
the
electric
spark
we
teodoro
would
say
although
we
have
sprung
from
the
grass
by
the
which
is
the
lowest
origin
conceivable
have
grown
into
stalwart
trees
long
live
labor
and
human
enterprise
i
can
not
but
think
that
we
golfins
though
heaven
knows
where
we
came
from
must
have
some
english
blood
in
our
veins
even
our
name
seems
to
me
to
be
of
purely
saxon
origin
i
give
it
this
etymology
or
as
you
may
say
well
and
my
brother
finds
it
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
while
i
find
it
in
that
marvellous
miniature
universe
the
human
eye
at
the
period
of
our
story
he
had
just
arrived
via
new
york
and
liverpool
and
as
he
declared
he
now
meant
to
remain
at
home
but
no
one
believed
it
for
he
had
said
so
many
times
before
and
had
not
kept
his
word
his
brother
c치rlos
was
a
gentler
being
placid
studious
a
slave
to
his
duties
and
devoted
to
mineralogy
and
metallurgy
to
the
point
of
caring
far
more
for
these
two
branches
of
learning
than
for
his
society
but
the
couple
lived
nevertheless
in
perfect
harmony
or
as
teodoro
said
in
an
isomorphous
state
crystallizing
on
the
same
system
as
for
himself
when
matrimony
was
spoken
of
he
would
say
to
me
marriage
would
be
an
epigenesis
a
crystallization
that
is
to
say
a
mode
of
crystallization
which
would
not
harmonize
with
my
nature
sof칤a
was
a
very
good
woman
who
had
been
very
handsome
but
whose
beauty
was
daily
losing
character
and
expression
from
her
unfortunate
tendency
to
stoutness
she
had
been
told
that
an
atmosphere
charged
with
coal
smoke
had
a
tendency
to
reduce
fat
and
for
this
reason
she
had
come
to
live
at
the
mines
without
ever
leaving
them
the
whole
year
through
the
horrible
air
charged
with
dust
calamine
and
smoke
annoyed
her
much
however
she
had
no
child
alive
and
her
principal
occupation
consisted
in
playing
the
piano
and
in
organizing
societies
of
benevolent
ladies
for
giving
the
poor
help
in
their
homes
and
for
maintaining
hospitals
and
schools
at
madrid
for
many
years
her
energy
had
been
prodigious
a
real
model
for
all
who
feel
prompted
to
acts
of
charity
with
the
help
of
two
or
three
ladies
of
rank
equally
devoted
to
their
humble
and
suffering
neighbors
she
had
organized
more
than
twenty
dramatic
performances
and
as
many
fancy
balls
six
and
two
all
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
among
her
other
manias
which
were
apt
to
be
but
transient
however
was
one
which
perhaps
is
less
commendable
than
that
for
helping
the
needy
and
which
consisted
in
surrounding
herself
with
dogs
and
cats
devoting
herself
to
these
animals
with
an
affection
really
worthy
to
be
called
love
lately
since
she
had
lived
at
socartes
she
had
kept
a
which
had
been
brought
to
her
as
a
commission
from
england
by
ulises
buli
the
head
of
the
machinery
department
this
was
a
delicate
and
slender
creature
as
tricky
and
amusing
as
a
child
it
was
called
l칤li
and
had
cost
a
small
fortune
in
london
as
dogs
go
on
fine
days
the
trio
walked
out
together
when
it
was
wet
they
played
and
sang
for
sof칤a
had
a
modest
pipe
which
at
socartes
passed
for
singing
the
deputy
engineer
had
a
deep
bass
voice
and
teodoro
likewise
was
c치rlos
could
sing
but
a
little
higher
so
that
the
whole
effect
was
somewhat
like
a
priestly
choir
in
which
sof칤a
treble
came
out
as
if
she
were
a
priestess
being
carried
off
to
be
immolated
all
the
pieces
they
sang
were
or
at
any
rate
sounded
like
priests
offering
a
sacrifice
and
a
priestess
being
sacrificed
on
the
days
when
they
walked
far
they
took
with
them
a
sort
of
picnic
afternoon
meal
one
evening
it
was
at
the
end
of
september
and
six
days
after
the
doctor
arrival
at
the
mines
the
party
were
returning
homewards
in
the
following
order
l칤li
sof칤a
teodoro
c치rlos
the
path
was
too
narrow
to
allow
of
their
walking
two
and
two
l칤li
wore
a
little
coat
or
gaberdine
with
his
mistress
initials
worked
upon
it
sof칤a
carried
her
parasol
like
a
gun
over
her
shoulder
and
teodoro
had
his
stick
in
precisely
the
same
position
with
his
hat
hanging
on
the
end
of
it
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
whims
to
walk
out
they
were
passing
above
la
trascava
when
l칤li
leaving
the
path
with
his
elastic
little
legs
like
springs
began
to
run
on
the
turf
that
covered
the
slope
to
the
chasm
first
he
ran
but
then
he
slipped
on
the
grass
sof칤a
gave
a
cry
of
terror
her
first
impulse
prompted
by
an
almost
maternal
feeling
was
to
run
after
the
little
beast
that
was
in
no
real
danger
but
her
husband
stopped
her
saying
the
devil
may
have
l칤li
if
he
wants
him
but
he
will
come
back
it
is
impossible
to
go
down
the
turf
here
is
so
slippery
l칤li
l칤li
cried
sof칤a
hoping
that
her
touching
appeal
would
arrest
the
creature
on
the
road
to
perdition
and
bring
him
back
to
the
path
of
virtue
and
duty
but
the
tenderest
adjurations
had
no
effect
on
the
rebellious
soul
of
l칤li
who
went
lower
and
lower
from
time
to
time
he
looked
up
at
his
mistress
with
his
bright
black
eyes
which
seemed
to
say
for
mercy
sake
do
not
be
so
foolish
at
the
large
white
rock
which
lay
like
a
lid
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
chasm
l칤li
stopped
all
stood
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
spot
and
they
at
once
perceived
something
moving
there
they
supposed
it
to
be
some
beast
of
prey
hiding
behind
the
rock
but
sof칤a
gave
another
shriek
of
astonishment
rather
than
of
terror
and
exclaimed
it
is
nela
what
are
you
doing
there
on
hearing
her
name
called
the
girl
appeared
greatly
disturbed
and
colored
deeply
what
are
you
doing
there
mad
child
repeated
the
lady
take
up
l칤li
and
bring
him
back
to
me
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
but
what
next
will
that
creature
be
doing
just
look
at
the
place
she
has
put
herself
in
it
is
all
your
fault
that
l칤li
went
down
there
what
an
example
to
set
the
poor
little
animal
it
is
all
your
fault
that
he
behaved
in
this
naughty
wilful
way
that
child
is
a
perfect
limb
of
mischief
said
don
c치rlos
to
his
brother
only
look
at
the
place
she
has
got
to
while
on
the
top
of
the
slope
they
were
thus
discussing
her
nela
down
at
the
bottom
was
trying
to
catch
l칤li
who
more
wilful
and
daring
than
he
had
ever
been
before
in
the
whole
course
of
his
monotonous
existence
constantly
eluded
her
grasp
his
mistress
shouted
to
him
in
vain
to
be
good
and
behave
himself
while
he
ignoring
the
most
elementary
principles
of
duty
went
on
leaping
and
frisking
looking
up
at
her
from
time
to
time
with
consummate
impudence
as
though
to
say
my
good
lady
just
go
on
with
your
walk
and
leave
me
in
peace
at
last
however
the
sportive
little
beast
got
entangled
among
the
briars
which
grew
in
the
hollow
and
there
his
little
got
him
into
dire
trouble
the
poor
dog
finding
it
impossible
to
escape
from
the
brushwood
began
to
bark
lamentably
for
help
he
will
be
lost
he
will
be
killed
wailed
the
se침ora
nela
nela
if
you
will
only
save
him
i
will
give
you
a
fine
big
dog
save
him
go
carefully
hold
fast
nela
went
boldly
to
the
rescue
setting
her
foot
on
the
brambles
and
creepers
that
grew
over
the
rift
and
holding
on
by
one
hand
to
the
rock
she
put
out
the
other
to
take
hold
of
l칤li
tail
by
which
she
pulled
him
out
of
the
tangle
in
which
he
had
been
caught
then
patting
and
coaxing
him
she
mounted
in
triumph
to
the
top
of
the
slope
it
is
your
fault
all
your
fault
said
sof칤a
crossly
and
boxing
the
dog
ears
very
gently
what
on
earth
made
you
go
down
into
that
hole
you
know
he
goes
after
you
wherever
he
finds
you
hussy
that
you
are
and
then
she
kissed
her
recovered
treasure
and
gave
him
one
or
two
mild
slaps
and
after
having
assured
herself
that
his
precious
skin
was
whole
she
pulled
his
little
coat
straight
which
had
got
dragged
over
his
head
and
gave
him
to
nela
saying
take
him
and
carry
him
in
your
arms
for
he
must
be
tired
and
such
a
long
scamper
may
do
him
harm
but
take
care
of
him
go
on
in
take
great
care
of
him
you
see
i
am
close
behind
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
the
family
party
set
out
again
with
nela
leading
the
way
l칤li
looked
at
his
mistress
over
nela
shoulder
and
seemed
to
say
my
good
mistress
what
a
simpleton
you
are
teodoro
golfin
had
said
not
a
word
during
the
whole
of
l칤li
agitating
escapade
but
when
they
had
started
on
their
way
once
more
and
were
crossing
the
fields
where
the
three
could
walk
abreast
without
inconvenience
the
doctor
said
to
his
brother
wife
i
can
not
but
think
dear
sof칤a
that
you
are
unreasonably
devoted
to
the
little
dog
to
be
sure
a
dog
that
cost
two
hundred
is
indeed
a
dog
among
dogs
still
i
can
not
but
ask
myself
how
it
is
that
you
have
spent
time
and
money
in
making
a
for
his
highness
the
terrier
while
it
has
never
occurred
to
you
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
for
nela
shoes
for
nela
exclaimed
sof칤a
laughing
what
for
i
should
like
to
know
she
would
have
worn
them
through
in
two
days
you
may
laugh
at
me
as
much
as
you
please
well
i
admit
that
my
affection
for
l칤li
amounts
to
an
extravagance
still
you
can
not
accuse
me
of
want
of
nor
indeed
i
must
say
should
i
ever
allow
you
to
take
such
a
liberty
and
as
she
spoke
she
drew
herself
up
with
a
solemn
look
of
offended
dignity
as
to
knowing
how
to
exercise
charity
with
due
prudence
and
judgment
i
believe
i
may
hold
my
own
with
any
one
be
it
whom
it
may
for
charity
does
not
consist
merely
in
giving
without
rhyme
or
reason
not
knowing
whether
your
alms
are
well
or
do
you
suppose
you
can
teach
me
anything
my
dear
teodoro
i
am
quite
as
experienced
in
such
matters
as
you
are
in
the
treatment
of
eyes
i
know
i
know
my
you
have
done
wonders
you
need
not
tell
me
for
the
fiftieth
time
of
all
the
dramatic
entertainments
balls
and
you
have
got
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
nor
of
the
lotteries
which
have
brought
in
large
sums
though
after
providing
food
for
any
number
of
idle
vagabonds
there
has
been
but
a
small
fraction
left
for
the
sick
and
suffering
all
these
facts
only
go
to
prove
to
my
mind
the
singular
state
of
a
society
which
can
not
be
charitable
without
dancing
or
lottery
no
we
need
not
discuss
all
that
i
know
and
admire
those
heroic
achievements
they
have
their
good
side
and
that
not
a
small
one
but
you
and
your
gay
friends
very
rarely
put
yourself
in
connection
with
any
poor
soul
to
learn
from
his
own
lips
the
cause
and
history
of
his
misery
or
to
discern
what
kind
of
wretchedness
it
is
that
oppresses
him
for
there
are
actually
some
troubles
so
extraordinary
that
the
gift
of
a
few
coppers
can
do
nothing
to
alleviate
them
no
nor
even
a
morsel
of
bread
here
we
have
our
philosopher
well
astride
on
his
hobby
said
sof칤a
spitefully
pray
how
do
you
know
what
i
have
ever
done
or
what
i
ought
to
do
nay
do
not
be
vexed
said
golfin
for
all
my
discourse
tends
to
a
single
point
and
that
is
that
nela
should
have
shoes
very
well
then
morning
i
will
buy
her
a
pair
no
for
i
will
buy
them
myself
this
evening
do
not
poach
on
my
preserves
se침ora
here
nela
cried
the
lady
seeing
that
she
had
gone
some
distance
ahead
do
not
go
so
fast
keep
in
sight
that
i
may
see
what
you
are
about
poor
little
creature
said
her
husband
who
could
guess
she
was
sixteen
years
old
she
is
dreadfully
stunted
miserable
little
thing
exclaimed
sof칤a
i
can
not
help
asking
why
god
should
permit
such
creatures
to
live
and
again
i
ask
myself
what
in
the
world
can
be
done
for
her
nothing
nothing
but
to
feed
and
clothe
her
after
a
fashion
but
you
see
she
tears
everything
she
puts
on
she
can
not
labor
because
she
faints
away
she
has
not
strength
enough
to
do
any
kind
of
work
she
skips
from
stone
to
stone
or
climbs
the
trees
playing
and
chattering
the
whole
day
long
and
singing
like
the
birds
what
clothes
she
has
are
soon
reduced
to
rags
and
yet
said
c치rlos
i
have
noticed
that
she
is
very
intelligent
there
is
a
great
deal
of
acuteness
and
cleverness
under
that
simple
exterior
and
wild
rusticity
no
no
nela
is
no
fool
by
a
long
way
if
any
one
had
taken
the
trouble
to
teach
her
anything
she
would
have
learnt
it
better
perhaps
than
most
children
would
you
believe
it
nela
has
a
great
imagination
but
lacking
as
she
does
the
most
rudimentary
knowledge
it
has
of
course
made
her
sentimental
and
superstitious
in
point
of
fact
she
is
in
the
condition
of
all
primitive
races
said
teodoro
she
is
at
the
pastoral
stage
of
civilization
only
yesterday
c치rlos
went
on
i
was
passing
by
la
trascava
and
i
saw
her
sitting
exactly
where
we
found
her
again
just
now
i
called
her
and
made
her
come
to
me
and
i
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
there
and
with
the
most
perfect
simplicity
she
told
me
she
was
talking
with
her
you
know
perhaps
that
nela
mother
threw
herself
into
that
chasm
that
is
to
say
that
she
killed
herself
said
sof칤a
she
was
a
woman
of
bad
character
and
worse
feeling
from
all
i
have
heard
of
her
c치rlos
was
not
living
here
then
but
they
say
she
drank
like
a
stoker
and
i
ask
you
do
these
vile
creatures
who
end
a
life
of
sin
by
committing
the
greatest
crime
of
all
suicide
deserve
any
pity
from
the
human
race
there
are
things
too
horrible
to
contemplate
wretches
that
ought
never
to
have
been
born
teodoro
may
argue
as
much
as
he
likes
but
i
can
not
help
asking
you
ask
nothing
my
dear
sister
said
teodoro
warmly
for
i
could
only
reply
that
the
suicide
deserves
our
deepest
and
fullest
pity
so
far
as
abuse
goes
heap
it
on
her
by
all
means
and
as
much
as
you
please
but
at
the
same
time
it
might
be
as
well
to
enquire
what
were
the
causes
that
brought
her
to
such
a
fearful
extremity
of
desperation
and
i
may
add
that
if
society
had
not
wholly
abandoned
her
and
left
her
no
way
out
but
the
yawning
door
of
that
hideous
abyss
which
seemed
to
invite
her
abandoned
by
society
well
some
must
be
said
sof칤a
flippantly
society
can
not
take
care
of
every
one
look
at
the
statistics
of
population
only
look
and
you
will
see
how
many
poor
there
are
to
provide
for
besides
supposing
society
does
overlook
some
what
is
religion
for
i
am
speaking
of
those
poor
wretches
who
add
to
all
their
other
miseries
ignorance
which
is
the
greatest
of
all
an
ignorant
soul
debased
and
superstitious
has
none
but
the
vaguest
and
absurdest
ideas
of
god
the
sense
of
something
great
and
unknown
instead
of
withholding
him
impels
him
to
crime
it
is
rarely
indeed
that
the
thought
of
religion
is
of
any
good
to
those
who
vegetate
in
stolid
ignorance
no
intelligent
friend
ever
goes
near
them
neither
master
nor
priest
the
only
superior
they
ever
come
into
contact
with
is
the
judge
who
tries
them
it
is
strange
to
see
how
inexorably
you
condemn
what
after
all
is
your
own
work
he
went
on
twisting
the
stick
on
which
his
hat
was
still
mounted
you
stand
looking
straight
before
you
seeing
at
the
very
threshold
of
your
own
comfortable
homes
a
crowd
of
neglected
creatures
deprived
of
everything
that
childhood
needs
from
parents
to
playthings
you
see
them
i
say
without
its
ever
occurring
to
you
to
raise
them
an
inch
in
the
world
by
telling
them
that
they
too
are
human
beings
and
giving
them
some
of
the
ideas
they
so
deplorably
lack
without
ever
dreaming
of
ennobling
them
by
lifting
them
out
of
their
brutalizing
mechanical
toil
to
some
intelligent
work
you
see
them
dwelling
in
filthy
hovels
sinking
lower
day
by
day
in
their
savage
squalor
and
it
never
occurs
to
you
to
spare
for
them
a
little
of
the
comfort
and
luxury
that
surround
you
you
save
all
your
energies
to
declaim
against
murder
robbery
and
suicide
without
ever
reflecting
that
you
are
in
fact
keeping
open
school
for
these
three
crimes
you
seem
to
forget
that
there
are
houses
of
refuge
hospitals
asylums
said
sof칤a
tartly
read
statistics
teodoro
and
you
will
see
the
number
of
miserable
creatures
read
statistics
i
do
not
read
statistics
my
dear
sister
and
your
statistics
count
for
nothing
with
me
asylums
are
good
not
that
they
can
ever
solve
the
great
problem
of
orphanage
a
hapless
orphan
dropped
in
the
streets
or
in
the
fields
bereft
of
all
personal
affection
and
cared
for
only
by
a
town
council
rarely
indeed
is
the
vacuum
filled
which
yawns
in
his
soul
for
the
love
of
a
parent
not
to
speak
of
the
vacuum
where
honor
and
responsibility
ought
to
be
and
so
rarely
are
found
and
on
that
point
i
have
an
idea
of
my
own
but
perhaps
it
will
appear
to
you
absurd
tell
us
at
any
rate
the
problem
of
orphanhood
and
the
miseries
of
infancy
will
never
be
completely
and
finally
solved
any
more
than
the
rest
of
our
great
social
problems
still
it
will
be
lightened
when
custom
supported
by
law
yes
by
law
you
see
i
am
in
earnest
when
custom
and
law
insist
that
every
orphan
whatever
its
birth
do
not
laugh
has
a
right
to
claim
adoption
by
some
married
couple
in
easy
circumstances
and
who
have
no
children
by
this
plan
there
will
be
no
childless
parents
and
no
fatherless
children
yes
by
this
plan
retorted
sof칤a
we
should
be
parents
to
nela
and
why
not
said
teodoro
at
the
same
time
you
would
not
waste
two
hundred
in
buying
a
dog
nor
the
livelong
blessed
day
in
talking
nonsense
to
his
highness
master
l칤li
and
why
are
rich
bachelors
to
be
exempt
under
this
delightful
law
why
should
not
they
also
be
burthened
each
with
his
orphan
i
have
no
objection
said
the
doctor
he
was
looking
at
the
ground
but
what
is
this
blood
they
all
looked
down
and
at
regular
intervals
they
saw
small
spots
of
blood
mercy
cried
sof칤a
covering
her
eyes
it
is
nela
see
it
is
where
she
has
trodden
these
are
her
footmarks
oh
yes
i
see
it
was
when
she
went
into
the
brambles
to
fetch
your
precious
dog
nela
come
here
nela
whose
right
foot
was
bleeding
a
good
deal
came
hobbling
back
again
give
me
my
poor
l칤li
said
the
lady
taking
the
dog
out
of
the
ragged
child
arms
do
not
hurt
him
does
it
hurt
you
much
poor
little
oh
how
it
is
i
can
not
bear
to
look
at
it
and
sof칤a
turned
her
back
to
spare
her
sensitive
nerves
hugging
l칤li
more
closely
let
us
see
what
has
happened
said
teodoro
lifting
nela
up
and
seating
her
on
a
high
stone
that
was
at
hand
then
putting
on
his
spectacles
he
said
it
is
quite
a
trifle
only
a
few
scratches
there
is
a
thorn
in
here
i
rather
that
hurts
you
yes
just
so
here
is
the
wait
a
minute
now
sof칤a
if
you
can
not
look
on
at
a
surgical
operation
you
had
better
walk
on
while
his
sister
went
slowly
forward
to
save
her
nervous
system
this
terrible
shock
golfin
took
a
small
case
out
of
his
pocket
and
a
pair
of
tweezers
out
of
the
case
and
in
less
than
a
winking
the
thorn
was
extracted
that
is
a
brave
little
woman
he
said
to
nela
who
had
not
even
winced
now
we
will
tie
this
foot
up
and
he
bound
it
round
with
his
handkerchief
marianela
jumped
down
to
walk
and
c치rlos
offered
her
his
hand
no
no
come
here
said
teodoro
he
took
the
little
girl
under
the
arms
and
with
a
rapid
and
dexterous
twist
perched
her
on
his
right
shoulder
if
you
do
not
feel
safe
hold
on
to
my
hair
he
said
it
will
not
come
off
now
you
must
carry
the
stick
with
the
hat
what
a
ridiculous
sight
said
sof칤a
in
fits
of
laughter
as
they
came
up
with
her
teodoro
with
nela
on
his
shoulder
and
then
the
stick
and
gessler
hat
on
the
top
chapter
x
nobody
children
there
you
see
a
man
ready
for
anything
and
everything
my
dear
sof칤a
said
teodoro
it
is
the
result
of
our
education
is
it
not
c치rlos
of
having
had
no
coddling
in
our
childhood
and
having
been
accustomed
from
our
tenderest
infancy
to
the
idea
that
no
one
could
be
our
inferior
men
who
have
made
themselves
as
we
have
done
who
without
any
mortal
help
nor
any
safeguard
but
strong
will
and
high
ambition
have
been
able
to
triumph
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
in
it
but
they
are
the
only
people
who
really
know
how
to
help
the
helpless
i
will
not
tell
you
half
the
things
i
have
been
able
to
do
in
my
life
treating
my
neighbor
as
myself
for
fear
of
falling
into
an
ugly
trick
of
singing
my
own
praises
for
fear
too
of
making
you
envious
in
spite
of
your
raffles
and
benevolent
lotteries
enough
of
that
nay
tell
us
or
tell
us
some
other
time
no
no
such
things
should
be
kept
secret
for
modesty
sake
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
can
not
boast
of
any
considerable
store
of
that
lovely
grace
i
am
not
lacking
in
vanity
and
one
of
the
things
i
am
vainest
of
is
of
having
been
a
beggar
of
having
asked
charity
from
door
to
door
of
having
walked
barefoot
with
my
brother
c치rlos
and
slept
in
corners
under
without
a
roof
without
shelter
without
a
home
of
any
kind
some
wonderful
spirit
of
energy
and
determination
burned
within
me
whence
it
came
i
know
not
but
i
felt
that
before
us
lay
two
paths
one
to
prison
and
one
to
glory
i
took
my
poor
little
brother
on
my
shoulders
just
as
i
am
carrying
nela
and
i
said
father
which
art
in
heaven
save
us
and
he
saved
us
i
learnt
to
read
and
then
i
taught
my
brother
i
served
many
masters
who
gave
me
food
and
let
me
go
to
school
i
saved
my
pittance
i
bought
a
and
scraped
enough
together
to
buy
some
books
how
i
began
medicine
i
do
not
know
but
somehow
i
did
while
my
brother
was
earning
a
living
as
an
errand
boy
in
a
shop
what
are
you
talking
about
exclaimed
sof칤a
much
annoyed
for
this
was
a
theme
she
particularly
disliked
i
can
not
help
asking
what
is
the
use
of
recalling
all
these
childish
details
besides
you
exaggerate
them
greatly
i
exaggerate
nothing
said
teodoro
with
triumphant
jollity
just
listen
se침ora
and
say
nothing
i
speak
of
what
i
know
with
the
authority
of
experience
hear
me
all
ye
poor
all
ye
helpless
ones
and
ye
forsaken
little
ones
i
took
to
medicine
god
knows
how
i
learnt
god
knows
how
a
worthy
man
blessings
on
his
memory
gave
me
good
counsel
and
helped
me
with
money
i
loved
the
science
but
how
could
i
study
without
ceasing
to
work
for
my
living
this
was
a
terrible
dilemma
do
you
remember
c치rlos
when
we
both
went
to
ask
for
employment
in
the
barber
shop
in
the
old
de
never
in
our
lives
had
either
of
us
had
a
razor
in
his
hand
but
we
had
to
earn
our
bread
by
shaving
at
first
we
only
looked
on
do
you
remember
c치rlos
and
then
we
wielded
the
noble
instruments
bleeding
was
the
making
of
us
then
i
began
to
study
anatomy
a
noble
a
glorious
science
but
my
became
a
serious
matter
and
i
had
to
give
up
working
for
the
worthy
he
cried
positively
cried
the
day
i
left
him
he
gave
me
two
and
his
wife
made
me
a
present
of
a
pair
of
her
old
then
i
went
as
a
valet
god
was
always
merciful
in
giving
me
good
masters
my
love
of
study
interested
these
dear
kind
people
and
they
allowed
me
as
much
spare
time
as
possible
i
sat
up
to
study
nay
i
studied
in
my
sleep
i
was
like
a
monomaniac
for
while
i
did
the
washing
i
repeated
the
names
of
the
different
parts
of
the
human
frame
i
remember
that
as
i
brushed
my
master
clothes
i
studied
muscular
anatomy
as
i
folded
a
sleeve
i
would
say
to
myself
and
over
his
trousers
i
would
repeat
in
that
house
they
used
to
give
me
broken
food
which
i
carried
to
my
brother
who
was
living
with
a
worthy
man
who
bought
and
sold
old
clothes
do
you
remember
c치rlos
i
remember
well
said
c치rlos
with
feeling
and
i
am
grateful
to
the
good
soul
who
gave
me
a
roof
over
my
head
in
return
for
some
trifling
service
in
keeping
his
accounts
and
it
was
there
that
i
was
so
lucky
as
to
come
across
the
retired
colonel
who
taught
me
the
elements
of
mathematics
well
you
have
not
a
rag
that
you
blush
to
display
to
all
the
world
snorted
sof칤a
my
brother
asked
me
for
bread
teodoro
went
coolly
on
and
my
answer
was
work
at
mathematics
one
day
my
master
gave
me
tickets
of
admission
to
the
theatre
de
la
cruz
i
took
my
brother
and
we
enjoyed
it
enormously
but
c치rlos
caught
a
cold
and
inflammation
of
the
lungs
that
was
a
dreadful
a
terrible
business
it
was
a
blow
at
the
very
root
of
our
existence
a
shot
in
our
backbone
but
who
is
cast
down
on
we
had
to
he
must
be
cured
a
physician
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
me
undertook
to
doctor
him
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
that
he
saved
my
life
in
that
squalid
hole
a
perfect
museum
of
old
clothes
old
iron
and
old
leather
god
was
on
our
side
i
see
it
plainly
oh
i
knew
very
well
in
whom
i
trusted
teodoro
went
on
with
the
fervid
rapid
eloquence
which
was
as
characteristic
of
the
man
as
his
black
and
leonine
countenance
but
for
my
brother
to
have
medicine
i
had
to
do
without
clothes
the
pharmacopeia
did
not
admit
of
tailors
bills
nay
prescription
after
prescription
first
my
cloak
went
then
my
overcoat
then
my
shoes
were
turned
into
pills
however
my
master
stood
by
me
i
got
some
clothes
once
more
and
my
brother
was
outside
the
house
again
the
doctor
said
will
get
quite
well
in
the
country
country
said
i
and
i
thought
it
over
then
he
may
go
to
the
school
of
mines
my
brother
was
a
good
mathematician
i
taught
him
some
chemistry
he
soon
took
a
fancy
to
rocks
and
stones
and
before
he
went
into
the
school
he
had
begun
going
out
into
the
fields
to
pick
up
pebbles
well
i
meanwhile
went
on
my
way
beaten
by
winds
and
waves
every
day
i
knew
something
more
of
medicine
a
famous
operator
took
me
as
his
assistant
then
i
was
no
longer
a
mere
menial
i
was
a
servant
to
science
my
master
fell
ill
i
nursed
him
like
a
brother
of
charity
but
he
died
leaving
me
a
legacy
god
bless
me
but
it
was
a
fortune
it
consisted
of
a
a
machine
for
making
cigars
a
and
four
thousand
in
money
my
brother
bought
books
and
i
bought
some
clothes
and
as
soon
as
i
was
decently
dressed
i
began
to
get
patients
it
really
seemed
as
if
folks
fell
ill
on
purpose
to
give
me
employment
on
straight
on
years
and
years
went
by
at
last
after
many
miseries
i
saw
far
off
the
way
to
a
refuge
still
my
brother
and
i
sailed
on
without
any
too
severe
toil
and
we
were
never
melancholy
god
smiled
upon
our
souls
well
indeed
for
us
god
held
out
his
hand
to
us
as
it
were
i
began
to
study
the
eye
and
soon
could
operate
for
cataract
but
i
wanted
something
more
than
this
i
was
earning
money
no
doubt
but
my
brother
cost
me
all
i
earned
at
last
however
c치rlos
passed
out
of
the
schools
three
cheers
for
the
brave
none
but
the
brave
win
the
day
i
saw
him
settled
at
riotinto
with
a
good
salary
and
then
off
i
went
to
america
i
was
a
sort
of
columbus
the
columbus
of
labor
a
sort
of
cort칠s
i
discovered
a
new
world
for
myself
and
having
discovered
it
i
conquered
it
you
are
your
own
trumpeter
said
sof칤a
laughing
if
there
are
still
heroes
to
be
found
you
are
one
of
them
said
c치rlos
with
eager
admiration
for
his
brother
well
set
to
work
now
noble
said
sof칤a
crown
your
achievement
by
working
a
miracle
and
restore
to
sight
a
man
blind
from
his
look
there
is
don
francisco
coming
out
to
meet
us
and
in
fact
mounting
the
ridge
which
shuts
in
the
mines
to
the
west
they
had
come
to
aldeacorba
and
past
the
house
of
pen치guilas
who
pulling
on
his
coat
in
the
utmost
haste
now
came
hurrying
towards
them
darkness
was
falling
fast
chapter
xi
the
patriarch
of
aldeacorba
the
cows
are
just
being
milked
he
began
without
wishing
them
i
thought
you
would
all
like
some
milk
i
hope
to
see
you
well
se침ora
sof칤a
and
you
don
teodoro
the
sight
of
you
is
good
for
sore
eyes
but
what
is
the
matter
with
mar칤a
canela
a
little
lame
paw
how
long
have
you
been
so
spoiled
little
one
the
whole
party
turned
into
the
they
could
hear
the
deep
lowing
of
the
cows
which
had
just
been
driven
to
their
stables
and
the
homely
sound
with
the
fresh
country
smell
of
the
hay
which
the
laborers
were
carrying
from
the
lofts
soothed
the
senses
and
the
mind
the
doctor
seated
nela
on
a
stone
bench
while
she
speechless
with
surprise
and
respect
dared
not
budge
an
inch
but
could
only
wonder
at
this
delightful
state
of
things
and
where
is
pablo
the
engineer
enquired
he
is
just
gone
down
into
the
garden
said
se침or
de
pen치guilas
as
he
offered
sof칤a
a
rustic
seat
you
might
run
off
and
join
him
nela
no
no
i
do
not
wish
her
to
go
yet
said
teodoro
detaining
her
besides
she
is
going
to
have
some
milk
with
us
do
you
wish
to
see
my
son
this
evening
asked
pen치guilas
no
yesterday
examination
was
quite
satisfactory
replied
golfin
the
operation
can
be
performed
and
successfully
ah
as
to
that
i
can
not
say
how
great
a
pleasure
it
would
be
to
give
sight
to
a
young
fellow
who
so
richly
deserves
it
i
need
not
tell
you
your
son
has
a
most
superior
intelligence
a
brilliant
imagination
and
a
most
delightful
nature
his
total
ignorance
of
the
outer
visible
world
only
throws
his
beautiful
qualities
into
relief
they
stand
out
in
conspicuous
simplicity
with
the
naked
charm
and
dignity
of
a
work
of
nature
untouched
and
unspoiled
by
the
hand
of
man
he
is
full
of
idealism
it
affects
all
his
thoughts
a
grand
and
beautiful
idealism
it
reminds
me
of
a
colossal
mass
of
unwrought
marble
a
block
as
it
lies
in
the
quarry
he
knows
nothing
of
reality
he
lives
a
charmed
life
a
life
of
pure
illusion
if
we
could
but
give
him
sight
still
i
say
to
myself
supposing
that
by
giving
him
sight
we
should
make
him
a
man
instead
of
an
it
is
a
question
that
raises
doubts
in
my
mind
however
we
are
bound
to
try
to
make
a
man
of
him
it
is
the
duty
of
science
we
will
drag
him
out
of
the
world
of
fancy
into
that
of
reality
and
then
with
his
powerful
mind
he
would
rapidly
gain
accurate
information
and
sound
judgment
he
would
soon
acquire
the
invaluable
power
of
estimating
the
true
relative
value
of
things
three
cups
of
milk
were
now
brought
in
white
warm
fragrant
and
frothy
to
the
very
rim
pen치guilas
handed
a
cup
first
to
sof칤a
and
the
two
gentlemen
took
the
others
but
teodoro
golfin
offered
his
to
nela
who
was
overwhelmed
with
bashfulness
and
refused
to
touch
it
come
little
woman
said
sof칤a
do
not
be
so
rude
take
what
is
given
you
another
cup
of
milk
for
don
teodoro
said
don
francisco
to
the
servant
and
then
they
heard
the
milk
as
it
flowed
into
the
pails
from
the
full
udders
of
the
cows
he
will
appreciate
the
true
relative
value
of
things
said
don
francisco
repeating
the
doctor
last
words
which
had
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
mind
that
is
an
admirable
observation
don
teodoro
and
with
regard
to
the
subject
under
discussion
i
must
explain
to
you
the
doubts
i
have
felt
for
some
days
past
but
i
may
as
well
sit
down
and
don
francisco
seated
himself
on
a
stool
he
had
in
his
hand
the
others
had
already
been
accommodated
with
chairs
brought
out
of
the
house
and
nela
was
still
perched
on
the
stone
bench
the
milk
she
had
drunk
as
she
was
bidden
had
left
a
thin
white
moustache
on
her
upper
lip
i
must
tell
you
don
teodoro
that
for
some
days
i
have
been
very
uneasy
at
the
excited
state
in
which
my
son
has
been
i
attribute
it
to
the
hope
that
has
been
held
out
to
him
but
still
there
is
something
else
something
more
than
that
you
know
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
reading
to
him
out
of
various
books
i
believe
that
this
reading
has
done
much
to
fire
his
imagination
and
instruct
his
mind
and
that
many
ideas
have
been
developed
in
his
brain
which
are
as
it
were
above
the
comprehension
of
a
blind
man
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
making
myself
clear
perfectly
there
is
no
end
to
his
discussions
and
arguments
i
am
astounded
by
the
depth
and
acuteness
of
his
remarks
though
i
feel
that
his
knowledge
is
mixed
up
with
a
thousand
misconceptions
from
want
of
method
and
from
his
ignorance
of
the
visible
world
it
could
not
be
otherwise
but
the
strangest
thing
is
that
carried
away
by
his
imagination
which
is
like
a
young
hercules
fettered
with
chains
within
a
dungeon
and
struggling
to
burst
its
bonds
and
break
down
walls
good
very
good
well
said
his
imagination
i
was
saying
can
not
rest
in
the
darkness
of
his
sense
and
strives
to
reach
our
world
of
daylight
making
up
for
his
want
of
sight
by
the
boldness
of
its
assumptions
pablo
has
a
wonderful
spirit
of
enquiry
but
it
is
like
a
noble
bird
whose
wings
are
clipped
for
some
few
days
he
has
been
almost
delirious
he
does
not
sleep
and
his
passion
for
information
has
been
almost
madness
at
all
hours
of
the
day
he
asks
for
some
new
book
and
at
every
pause
he
makes
the
keenest
observations
but
with
such
a
mixture
of
simple
innocence
that
he
makes
me
laugh
he
asserts
and
maintains
the
absurdest
things
and
if
i
contradict
him
i
am
really
afraid
of
his
going
out
of
his
mind
of
his
brain
softening
if
you
could
only
see
how
melancholy
and
how
disputatious
he
sometimes
is
he
takes
up
an
idea
and
come
what
may
it
is
impossible
to
get
it
out
of
his
head
now
for
some
days
he
has
had
a
fixed
idea
which
is
as
touching
as
it
is
preposterous
he
will
have
it
that
nela
is
pretty
they
all
laughed
and
nela
turned
scarlet
that
nela
is
pretty
exclaimed
teodoro
kindly
well
and
so
she
is
oh
sweetly
pretty
particularly
with
that
moustache
said
sof칤a
she
has
a
dear
little
face
of
her
own
repeated
teodoro
putting
his
hand
under
her
chin
sof칤a
lend
me
your
handkerchief
come
we
will
get
rid
of
the
moustache
teodoro
returned
the
handkerchief
to
sof칤a
after
wiping
nela
face
don
francisco
told
the
girl
to
go
and
join
the
blind
boy
and
she
hobbled
away
and
if
i
contradict
him
he
then
went
on
my
son
tells
me
that
perhaps
the
gift
of
sight
has
weakened
my
perception
of
the
true
aspect
of
things
a
quaint
paradox
do
not
contradict
him
at
all
and
for
the
present
discontinue
your
readings
for
a
few
days
we
must
adopt
a
regimen
of
absolute
tranquillity
the
brain
must
be
treated
with
the
utmost
consideration
before
attempting
any
operation
of
this
kind
if
it
is
indeed
god
will
that
my
son
should
receive
his
sight
said
pen치guilas
devoutly
i
shall
regard
you
as
the
greatest
and
most
beneficent
of
men
the
darkness
of
his
eyes
is
the
darkness
of
my
life
that
black
shadow
has
saddened
all
my
days
and
clouds
all
the
wealth
and
ease
of
which
i
am
master
for
i
am
rich
but
of
what
use
are
riches
how
can
i
care
for
the
things
he
can
not
see
only
a
month
ago
i
fell
heir
to
a
fine
fortune
you
know
don
c치rlos
my
cousin
faustino
died
at
matamoros
he
had
no
children
so
my
brother
manuel
and
i
are
his
heirs
it
is
throwing
pearls
before
swine
not
as
regards
my
brother
who
has
a
daughter
a
sweet
girl
old
enough
to
marry
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
a
wretched
man
who
can
never
see
his
son
enjoy
the
best
pleasures
of
a
respectable
and
easy
position
a
long
silence
followed
interrupted
only
by
the
gentle
lowing
of
the
cows
in
the
adjoining
stable
and
then
added
the
worthy
father
in
melancholy
tones
he
knows
nothing
of
the
pleasures
of
work
the
greatest
pleasure
of
all
ignorant
as
he
is
of
the
beauties
of
nature
what
can
he
know
of
the
delights
of
the
country
or
the
charms
of
agriculture
i
can
not
imagine
how
god
can
bear
to
deprive
a
human
creature
of
the
pleasure
of
admiring
a
fat
beast
a
tree
loaded
with
pears
or
a
green
pasture
of
seeing
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
their
abundance
of
sending
out
the
laborers
to
their
day
toil
and
reading
the
signs
of
the
weather
in
the
sky
for
him
life
is
simply
a
fevered
dream
it
is
lonely
too
solitary
for
he
can
never
have
the
comfort
of
a
family
round
him
when
i
die
what
family
will
the
poor
blind
boy
have
he
will
not
want
to
marry
nor
will
he
find
a
woman
of
good
family
who
would
engage
herself
to
him
in
spite
of
his
wealth
nor
indeed
could
i
advise
him
to
marry
so
that
when
don
teodoro
gave
me
a
hope
i
felt
as
if
heaven
was
opened
to
me
i
had
visions
of
a
young
and
happy
and
sensible
marriage
cherubs
my
grandchildren
fluttered
round
me
i
saw
my
tombstone
graced
and
fragrant
with
the
blossoms
of
a
future
generation
and
the
loving
care
which
even
after
death
should
follow
me
to
the
you
can
not
enter
into
all
this
you
can
not
know
how
my
brother
who
is
as
good
as
gold
god
bless
him
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
my
hopes
began
to
plot
and
plan
and
here
this
is
what
he
says
and
he
took
out
a
parcel
of
letters
which
he
turned
over
for
a
few
minutes
without
finding
the
one
he
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
he
was
beside
himself
with
delight
and
he
said
to
me
will
marry
my
florentina
to
your
pablo
and
so
we
shall
get
compound
interest
on
the
half
million
of
left
by
cousin
faustino
i
can
see
him
poor
old
manuel
rubbing
his
hands
and
strutting
about
as
his
way
is
when
he
has
hit
on
a
good
idea
i
am
expecting
him
and
his
daughter
to
arrive
at
any
hour
they
are
coming
to
stay
with
me
for
the
of
october
and
to
see
what
comes
of
this
attempt
to
bless
my
son
with
the
light
of
day
by
this
time
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
party
of
four
became
aware
of
a
most
appetizing
vapor
issuing
from
the
house
and
announcing
a
savory
the
village
patriarch
who
seemed
the
very
incarnation
of
the
spirit
of
the
place
a
tranquil
melancholy
spoke
again
presently
my
brother
happiness
and
my
own
depends
on
my
having
a
son
whom
i
may
propose
as
a
husband
for
his
daughter
who
is
as
sweet
and
fair
as
the
holy
virgin
as
we
see
her
represented
when
the
angel
of
the
lord
comes
to
say
lord
is
with
thee
my
blind
boy
is
not
the
man
but
my
pablo
with
his
eyesight
would
realize
my
fondest
dreams
and
bring
the
blessing
of
god
into
my
house
they
were
all
silent
deeply
impressed
by
the
worthy
father
simple
and
pathetic
utterances
and
he
himself
raised
his
rough
brown
hand
hardened
by
labor
to
wipe
away
a
tear
what
have
you
to
say
to
all
this
c치rlos
asked
his
brother
i
can
say
no
more
than
that
i
have
conscientiously
examined
the
case
and
can
find
no
sufficient
reason
for
saying
it
is
hopeless
as
the
other
distinguished
operators
have
said
whom
our
good
friend
has
consulted
i
can
not
pledge
myself
to
succeed
nor
can
i
think
it
impossible
the
examination
i
made
yesterday
revealed
no
defect
or
injury
in
the
retina
and
no
disease
in
the
optic
nerve
if
the
retina
is
perfect
all
that
is
needed
is
the
removal
of
some
impediment
in
front
of
it
the
crystalline
lens
often
becomes
opaque
sometimes
hard
and
stony
and
this
is
what
does
the
mischief
if
all
the
other
parts
of
the
organ
are
healthy
and
work
but
in
the
commonwealth
of
the
eye
many
individual
portions
are
only
too
ready
to
become
atrophied
by
idleness
so
that
in
short
it
amounts
simply
to
congenital
cataract
said
pen치guilas
eagerly
oh
no
se침or
if
it
were
no
more
than
that
it
would
be
a
happy
thing
for
us
all
that
would
be
needed
would
be
to
get
rid
of
the
part
that
does
its
duty
so
badly
it
ought
to
let
the
light
in
and
instead
of
that
it
is
congested
degenerate
stony
and
as
opaque
as
a
wall
no
there
is
something
more
than
that
don
francisco
the
iris
is
defective
the
pupil
must
be
taken
in
still
i
can
laugh
all
these
details
to
scorn
if
when
i
enter
into
possession
as
it
were
of
this
dormant
organ
i
only
find
the
choroid
and
the
retina
uninjured
if
on
the
other
hand
when
i
have
removed
the
opaque
lens
and
let
the
light
in
i
find
complete
amaurosis
if
it
were
only
partial
that
would
be
something
but
if
it
is
total
when
the
nerve
of
sight
is
dead
we
can
do
nothing
the
deep
mysteries
of
life
are
closed
against
us
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
patience
this
case
is
to
me
a
most
interesting
one
there
are
symptoms
which
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
internal
function
is
unimpaired
the
retina
as
sovereign
lord
seems
quite
disposed
to
receive
the
light
i
shall
introduce
to
it
and
that
high
functionary
the
vitreous
humor
will
probably
find
it
no
novelty
if
from
long
want
of
exercise
it
has
sunk
into
a
state
of
incipient
glaucoma
a
kind
of
melancholy
we
will
treat
it
for
that
all
will
then
be
well
in
that
darkened
chamber
but
there
is
another
thing
to
be
considered
a
fissured
iris
and
an
ordinary
cataract
usually
admit
some
gleam
of
light
and
our
patient
sees
not
a
glimmer
this
made
me
hesitate
in
fact
the
sclerotic
too
is
very
much
thickened
the
impediments
to
the
admission
of
light
are
many
and
serious
however
we
shall
see
don
francisco
have
you
courage
for
anything
courage
what
should
i
have
courage
for
asked
don
francisco
sir
you
will
want
all
your
courage
if
well
if
if
after
undergoing
a
painful
operation
your
son
is
still
as
blind
as
before
i
said
to
you
plainly
the
case
is
not
desperate
shall
i
operate
and
i
answered
and
i
answer
once
more
yes
operate
and
god
will
be
done
onwards
aye
onwards
you
have
taken
my
motto
don
francisco
rose
and
wrung
the
surgeon
hands
that
were
so
like
a
lion
paws
in
this
climate
the
operation
may
be
favorably
performed
early
in
october
golfin
went
on
we
will
decide
on
the
regimen
to
which
we
must
subject
our
patient
meanwhile
we
will
be
going
for
it
is
fresh
up
on
this
hill
pen치guilas
pressed
shelter
and
supper
on
his
friends
but
they
would
not
accept
they
set
out
homewards
with
nela
whom
teodoro
insisted
on
taking
with
him
and
don
francisco
kept
them
company
as
far
as
the
works
soothed
by
the
silence
and
beauty
of
the
night
they
fell
into
conversation
on
lighter
themes
on
the
yield
and
profits
of
the
mines
and
other
local
matters
the
golfins
having
reached
home
don
francisco
turned
back
alone
and
walking
slowly
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
was
thinking
of
the
terrible
days
of
doubt
and
hope
of
expectation
and
anxiety
which
were
coming
on
him
presently
he
was
met
by
choto
and
the
pair
lazily
climbed
the
wooden
stair
the
moon
gave
them
light
and
the
old
man
shadow
went
up
in
front
of
him
broken
by
the
steps
into
a
zigzag
monster
that
leaped
from
plank
to
plank
the
dog
trotted
by
its
side
and
don
francisco
in
the
absence
of
any
other
mortal
to
whom
he
could
confide
the
thoughts
that
wearied
his
brain
presently
said
oh
choto
will
it
succeed
chapter
xii
doctor
celipin
that
worthy
se침or
centeno
having
refreshed
his
mind
with
the
dull
columns
of
his
newspaper
and
his
wife
after
enjoying
the
more
intoxicating
delights
of
counting
and
feeling
the
coin
in
the
stocking
had
taken
themselves
to
bed
children
first
and
parents
after
they
had
all
marched
off
to
their
respective
couches
first
there
was
the
mumbled
litany
sounding
like
some
muttered
gibberish
then
yawns
while
the
sluggard
fingers
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
then
the
family
slept
when
the
house
was
as
still
as
the
grave
itself
a
soft
rustling
began
to
be
audible
in
the
kitchen
like
the
stirring
of
bats
coming
out
of
their
hiding
nooks
to
see
life
the
hampers
opened
and
celipin
heard
these
words
celipin
look
here
i
have
got
something
nice
for
you
celipin
could
see
nothing
but
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
from
nela
two
having
assured
himself
of
their
genuineness
by
touch
since
he
could
hardly
have
done
so
by
sight
he
remained
speechless
with
astonishment
don
teodoro
gave
them
to
me
added
the
girl
to
buy
myself
a
pair
of
shoes
but
i
do
not
want
shoes
so
i
give
them
to
you
and
so
you
will
get
on
faster
hurrah
you
are
as
good
as
the
holy
virgin
nela
i
want
very
little
more
now
and
when
i
have
got
another
or
so
of
you
shall
see
what
celipin
is
made
of
aye
and
listen
to
me
child
the
man
who
gave
me
that
money
ran
about
the
streets
barefoot
begging
when
he
was
a
boy
and
now
you
do
not
mean
it
don
teodoro
and
now
he
has
such
lots
of
money
they
say
six
mules
could
not
carry
it
all
yes
and
he
slept
in
the
streets
and
was
an
errand
boy
and
had
no
breeches
in
short
was
poorer
than
a
rat
and
his
brother
don
c치rlos
lived
in
an
shop
lord
save
us
what
wonderful
things
we
live
to
hear
of
well
i
will
go
and
find
an
shop
where
i
can
live
well
and
after
that
he
became
a
barber
to
earn
a
living
and
be
able
to
study
ah
look
here
then
i
have
a
great
mind
to
go
straight
into
a
barber
shop
i
shall
soon
have
to
shave
myself
and
i
am
brisk
and
quick
enough
thank
god
only
wait
till
i
get
to
madrid
shaving
on
one
hand
and
studying
on
the
other
at
the
end
of
two
months
i
will
know
everything
look
here
it
has
just
struck
me
that
i
am
made
to
be
a
yes
a
doctor
what
with
feeling
pulses
and
looking
at
tongues
that
is
the
way
to
fill
your
pockets
don
teodoro
nela
went
on
had
much
less
than
you
for
you
will
soon
have
five
and
with
five
you
can
get
almost
everything
don
teodoro
and
don
c치rlos
were
like
the
birds
that
fly
about
without
house
or
home
all
alone
in
the
world
well
by
managing
well
they
got
learned
don
teodoro
studied
dead
bodies
and
don
c치rlos
studied
stones
and
so
they
learnt
to
be
gentlemen
and
men
of
importance
and
that
is
why
don
teodoro
is
such
a
friend
to
the
poor
celipin
you
should
have
seen
him
this
evening
when
he
jumped
me
upon
his
shoulder
and
then
he
gave
me
his
cup
of
milk
and
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
lady
all
strong
active
men
are
the
same
said
celipin
sharply
you
will
see
how
brave
and
fine
i
shall
look
when
i
wear
a
long
cloak
and
a
high
hat
and
i
will
wear
those
stockings
on
my
hands
gloves
they
call
them
and
never
take
them
off
excepting
to
feel
a
pulse
i
will
have
a
stick
with
a
gilt
knob
and
will
wear
such
clothes
nothing
shall
ever
touch
my
skin
but
fine
linen
lord
love
you
child
but
you
will
laugh
to
see
me
do
not
be
fancying
that
you
can
rise
to
such
things
at
once
you
who
are
as
bare
as
an
egg
said
the
girl
you
must
go
step
by
step
learning
one
thing
and
another
i
advise
you
before
you
learn
to
cure
sick
folks
to
learn
to
write
and
so
you
ought
if
it
is
only
to
leave
a
letter
for
your
mother
asking
her
to
forgive
you
and
telling
her
that
you
are
gone
away
from
home
to
improve
yourself
to
make
your
way
like
don
teodoro
and
become
a
clever
doctor
do
not
talk
nonsense
child
who
does
not
know
that
writing
comes
first
only
let
me
get
a
pen
in
my
hand
and
you
will
see
me
flourish
away
at
the
letters
and
what
beautiful
fine
strokes
i
will
make
up
and
down
like
don
francisco
pen치guilas
name
at
the
end
of
a
write
do
not
talk
to
me
in
four
days
you
will
see
what
letters
i
will
aye
you
shall
hear
them
read
and
see
what
grand
ideas
i
can
hatch
out
and
set
them
down
too
in
such
fine
words
as
will
make
you
all
look
foolish
bless
you
child
but
you
have
no
notion
how
clever
i
can
be
i
feel
it
inside
my
head
here
buzzing
and
humming
burumbum
like
the
water
in
the
boiler
of
a
it
will
not
let
me
sleep
and
i
feel
as
if
all
the
sciences
in
the
world
came
rushing
in
and
flapped
blindly
about
like
bats
wanting
me
to
study
all
the
sciences
i
must
learn
them
all
i
must
not
leave
out
well
you
will
see
but
there
must
be
a
great
many
pablo
pen치guilas
knows
them
all
and
he
told
me
that
there
are
a
great
great
many
and
that
a
man
whole
lifetime
is
not
enough
to
learn
even
one
never
do
you
believe
well
you
will
see
what
i
can
do
and
the
best
of
all
is
what
don
c치rlos
learns
why
only
think
he
picks
up
a
stone
and
makes
brass
of
it
indeed
they
do
say
he
makes
silver
and
even
gold
learn
that
science
celipillo
do
not
you
be
mistaken
nela
there
is
nothing
like
knowing
how
to
take
a
wrist
and
look
at
a
tongue
and
tell
in
a
minute
in
what
corner
of
a
body
the
mischief
lies
they
say
that
don
teodoro
can
take
a
eye
out
and
put
him
in
a
new
one
that
he
can
see
with
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
born
with
it
just
think
what
it
is
to
see
a
man
dying
and
to
make
him
hale
and
sound
again
only
by
making
him
swallow
flies
let
us
say
stewed
down
on
a
monday
with
hazel
twigs
gathered
by
a
maid
named
juana
i
say
that
is
something
worth
yes
you
shall
see
you
shall
see
what
i
will
do
doctor
celipin
de
socartes
i
tell
you
my
fame
will
reach
as
far
as
havana
good
good
cried
nela
delighted
but
remember
you
must
be
a
good
boy
because
the
reason
your
parents
have
taught
you
nothing
is
only
because
they
were
not
clever
enough
and
so
as
you
are
clever
you
must
pray
for
them
to
the
holy
virgin
and
not
forget
to
send
them
some
of
all
the
money
you
are
going
to
get
i
will
be
sure
to
send
them
some
you
see
it
is
not
because
i
owe
them
any
grudge
that
i
am
going
to
run
away
and
before
long
very
soon
you
will
see
a
porter
come
up
from
the
station
so
loaded
with
big
parcels
that
he
can
hardly
stand
and
what
will
they
be
why
petticoats
for
mother
and
the
girls
and
a
tall
hat
for
father
and
you
i
will
send
you
a
pair
of
you
are
in
a
hurry
with
your
presents
said
nela
smothering
a
laugh
for
me
stop
i
have
just
got
another
idea
shall
i
tell
you
it
is
that
you
should
come
with
me
two
of
us
together
we
should
help
each
other
to
earn
money
and
to
learn
for
you
are
clever
too
i
am
too
sharp
not
to
see
that
and
you
can
learn
to
be
a
lady
as
i
can
to
be
a
gentleman
oh
lord
how
i
should
laugh
to
see
you
playing
the
piano
like
do침a
sof칤a
what
a
simpleton
you
are
why
i
am
no
good
for
anything
if
i
went
with
you
i
should
only
be
a
clog
and
burden
to
you
but
they
say
now
that
don
pablo
is
going
to
be
made
to
see
and
when
he
can
see
you
will
have
nothing
to
do
in
socartes
what
do
you
think
of
my
plan
why
do
not
you
answer
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
nela
made
no
answer
celipin
asked
her
again
but
got
no
answer
go
to
sleep
celipin
she
said
from
the
bottom
of
the
baskets
i
am
dreadfully
sleepy
if
my
brain
will
let
me
sleep
god
save
us
and
a
minute
later
he
was
dreaming
of
himself
in
the
semblance
of
don
teodoro
golfin
fixing
new
eyes
in
old
sockets
splitting
open
fragments
of
rock
and
snatching
sick
men
from
the
jaws
of
death
by
means
of
doses
of
flies
stewed
on
a
monday
with
hazel
twigs
picked
by
a
maiden
he
saw
himself
dressed
with
gorgeous
garments
his
hands
encased
in
perfumed
gloves
and
riding
in
a
coach
drawn
by
swans
instead
of
horses
invited
by
kings
and
courted
by
queens
attending
ladies
of
distinction
lauded
by
nobles
and
carried
in
triumph
by
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
chapter
xiii
between
two
baskets
nela
had
shut
herself
into
her
baskets
to
be
alone
we
will
follow
her
however
and
look
in
upon
her
thoughts
but
first
we
must
give
a
little
more
of
her
history
having
entirely
lacked
all
instruction
in
her
infancy
having
equally
lacked
all
those
soft
endearments
which
unfailingly
open
the
mind
to
recognize
certain
truths
marianela
powerful
imagination
had
conceived
a
strange
set
of
ideas
a
wild
and
fanciful
theogony
and
a
highly
whimsical
scheme
of
cause
and
effect
teodoro
comparison
of
nela
mind
with
the
early
stage
of
a
primitive
race
was
a
particularly
happy
one
in
her
as
in
them
the
fascination
of
the
marvellous
was
the
predominant
sense
she
believed
in
supernatural
agencies
apart
from
the
one
and
supreme
god
and
saw
in
all
natural
objects
an
abstract
personality
by
no
means
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
men
in
spite
of
all
this
however
nela
had
some
knowledge
of
the
gospel
it
had
never
been
taught
her
to
be
sure
but
she
had
heard
such
things
talked
of
she
saw
that
people
went
to
a
function
they
called
the
mass
and
she
understood
the
idea
of
a
sublime
sacrifice
but
beyond
this
her
notions
could
not
go
the
contagion
of
a
common
feeling
had
accustomed
her
mind
to
reverence
the
image
of
the
crucified
god
she
knew
it
should
be
kissed
and
she
even
could
repeat
some
prayers
that
she
had
learnt
mechanically
she
knew
whatever
she
wanted
she
could
ask
of
god
but
this
was
all
the
absolute
neglect
in
which
her
whole
nature
had
been
left
until
the
time
of
her
acquaintance
with
pablo
pen치guilas
was
the
cause
of
this
confusion
and
her
friendship
with
this
strange
being
who
shut
up
in
darkness
nevertheless
with
his
mind
eye
boldly
investigated
all
the
problems
of
life
had
come
to
her
too
late
nela
system
of
philosophy
of
her
own
fabrication
had
already
petrified
a
strange
compound
of
paganism
and
sentimentality
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
said
that
marianela
though
her
spirit
ranged
so
far
outside
the
common
atmosphere
was
well
endowed
with
good
sense
and
could
form
a
sound
judgment
on
the
things
of
daily
life
as
has
been
seen
in
the
advice
she
gave
to
celipin
this
no
doubt
was
due
to
the
native
soundness
of
her
mind
the
strongest
instinct
of
her
nature
was
her
love
nay
her
secret
passion
for
physical
beauty
wherever
she
saw
it
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
this
impulse
in
a
human
soul
growing
up
in
total
solitude
so
far
as
society
and
teaching
were
concerned
and
in
constant
intercourse
in
close
intimacy
we
may
say
with
nature
and
all
its
sublime
or
gracious
beauty
light
color
eloquent
inarticulate
voices
and
infinite
variety
of
form
and
marianela
admiration
had
assumed
the
guise
of
worship
in
obedience
to
a
law
which
also
governs
the
primitive
race
she
had
personified
all
the
beauty
she
saw
around
her
and
worshipped
it
in
a
single
incarnation
ideal
but
human
this
divinity
of
her
imagination
she
called
the
virgin
mary
a
conception
she
had
derived
from
the
domain
of
religious
thought
of
which
she
knew
so
little
and
the
virgin
mary
would
not
have
become
her
cherished
ideal
if
she
had
not
joined
to
her
moral
perfections
all
the
physical
gifts
of
beauty
and
grace
if
her
aspect
had
not
been
noble
and
attractive
at
once
human
and
divine
if
it
had
not
seemed
to
nela
the
epitome
in
which
were
concentrated
all
the
glory
of
light
the
sober
peace
of
darkness
the
music
of
running
waters
the
grace
and
sweetness
of
flowers
the
freshness
of
the
dew
the
low
complaining
of
the
wind
the
spotless
purity
of
the
mountain
snow
the
loving
glances
of
the
stars
and
the
solemn
majesty
of
the
clouds
as
they
ride
across
the
vault
of
heaven
the
person
of
god
himself
she
conceived
of
as
terrible
and
austere
inspiring
respect
rather
than
love
all
that
was
gracious
was
bestowed
by
the
virgin
and
she
was
the
giver
of
all
that
human
creatures
could
ask
for
god
frowned
while
she
smiled
god
chastised
but
she
forgave
this
last
notion
was
by
no
means
a
strange
one
it
is
accepted
with
almost
absolute
faith
among
the
laboring
classes
of
the
rural
parts
of
spain
nor
is
it
at
all
uncommon
when
we
find
a
strong
imagination
joined
to
extreme
ignorance
to
meet
with
the
fusion
which
existed
in
nela
mind
of
all
the
beauties
of
nature
with
the
beautiful
personification
which
combines
all
the
칝sthetic
charms
of
the
christian
ideal
if
the
darkness
in
which
nela
dwelt
had
only
been
more
complete
if
she
had
but
been
rather
more
destitute
of
religious
notions
she
would
have
been
an
utter
pagan
and
have
worshipped
the
moon
the
woods
the
rivers
fire
and
the
sun
this
was
nela
as
her
life
in
socartes
had
made
her
and
such
she
remained
till
she
was
fifteen
after
that
her
comradeship
with
pablo
and
her
frequent
talk
with
the
lad
whose
ideas
were
so
broad
and
so
sound
had
somewhat
modified
her
tone
of
thought
but
she
still
allowed
supreme
sovereignty
to
physical
beauty
she
still
superstitiously
adored
the
virgin
as
the
embodiment
of
all
the
loveliness
of
nature
and
in
a
way
of
all
moral
law
crowning
her
system
with
the
most
extraordinary
ideas
as
to
death
and
the
life
to
come
curling
herself
up
in
her
basket
marianela
reflections
took
this
form
holy
mother
of
god
why
why
did
you
not
make
me
beautiful
why
did
you
not
look
down
on
me
as
soon
as
i
was
born
for
the
more
i
look
at
myself
the
uglier
i
seem
to
grow
oh
why
am
i
in
this
world
at
all
of
what
good
can
i
be
who
can
care
for
me
one
single
soul
lady
mother
only
one
and
he
only
because
he
can
not
see
me
what
is
to
become
of
me
when
he
sees
me
and
casts
me
off
for
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
ever
love
me
when
he
sees
my
miserable
little
body
my
freckled
face
my
ugly
mouth
my
sharp
nose
my
dirty
brown
skin
all
my
hideous
little
self
of
no
good
to
any
one
but
to
kick
perhaps
what
is
that
only
nela
nothing
at
all
she
is
of
no
use
to
any
one
but
the
blind
boy
if
his
eyes
are
opened
if
he
turns
and
looks
at
me
i
shall
drop
down
dead
he
is
the
only
being
to
whom
is
anything
more
important
than
the
cats
and
the
birds
he
loves
me
loves
me
as
lovers
love
their
as
god
intends
human
beings
to
love
each
oh
lady
mother
now
that
you
are
going
to
work
a
miracle
and
let
him
see
make
me
beautiful
or
strike
me
dead
for
i
shall
not
be
wanted
any
more
in
this
world
i
am
good
for
nothing
and
ever
shall
be
excepting
to
one
person
am
i
sorry
then
that
he
should
be
able
to
see
no
no
not
that
no
i
want
him
to
see
i
would
give
my
own
eyes
for
him
to
see
with
his
i
would
give
my
life
i
hope
don
teodoro
can
work
the
miracle
as
they
say
blessings
on
all
wise
men
what
i
do
not
want
is
that
my
master
should
ever
see
me
before
i
will
let
him
see
me
oh
mother
i
will
bury
myself
alive
i
will
throw
myself
into
the
yes
the
earth
shall
cover
my
ugliness
i
ought
never
to
have
been
born
she
writhed
in
her
narrow
basket
and
then
she
went
on
all
my
heart
and
thought
are
for
him
that
poor
blind
man
who
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
be
fond
of
me
he
is
the
first
being
in
the
world
to
me
next
to
the
virgin
mary
oh
if
only
i
were
tall
and
handsome
if
i
had
the
figure
and
the
face
and
the
color
above
all
the
color
of
other
girls
if
i
could
only
make
a
lady
of
myself
and
dress
myself
and
then
my
greatest
joy
would
be
to
think
that
his
eyes
liked
to
look
at
me
if
i
were
like
other
girls
even
like
mariuca
how
soon
i
would
find
a
way
of
getting
taught
and
being
made
a
lady
of
oh
mother
mary
queen
of
the
world
the
only
creature
that
loves
me
i
am
going
to
lose
he
will
leave
me
why
did
you
ever
let
him
love
me
and
let
me
love
him
it
ought
not
never
to
have
been
the
tears
poured
down
her
cheeks
she
folded
her
arms
and
turned
over
and
even
when
half
asleep
she
still
was
speaking
to
herself
oh
how
much
i
love
you
child
of
my
soul
love
me
too
love
me
very
much
it
is

who
is
no
good
to
any
love

very
much
let
me
give
you
a
kiss

chapter
xiv
how
the
virgin
mary
appeared
to
nela
the
thoughts
which
fade
and
fly
as
sleep
overcomes
us
very
commonly
lurk
in
some
hole
or
corner
ready
to
take
us
by
storm
again
as
soon
as
we
wake
thus
it
was
that
mariquilla
who
having
fallen
asleep
with
her
head
full
of
strange
fancies
of
the
virgin
of
the
blind
lad
and
of
her
own
ugliness
which
she
longed
so
wildly
to
see
changed
into
wonderful
loveliness
woke
with
the
same
ideas
in
her
brain
when
se침ana
call
roused
her
in
her
basket
as
soon
as
her
eyes
were
open
nela
put
up
her
usual
prayer
to
the
virgin
mother
a
sort
of
litany
compounded
of
the
ordinary
litany
to
the
virgin
and
of
certain
clauses
of
her
own
devising
and
forming
altogether
an
address
which
would
look
strange
enough
if
it
were
written
down
among
other
things
prayer
said
thou
didst
appear
to
me
in
my
dreams
last
night
oh
lady
and
promise
to
comfort
me
now
i
am
awake
and
still
i
feel
as
if
i
saw
thy
face
just
before
me
and
far
lovelier
than
all
the
grand
and
lovely
things
in
the
world
and
as
she
spoke
she
turned
and
gazed
round
her
noticing
in
herself
the
utter
vagueness
with
which
she
did
so
she
thought
to
herself
something
has
come
over
me
what
is
the
matter
nela
asked
se침ana
seeing
the
girl
stand
with
her
eyes
wide
open
and
fixed
on
a
spot
in
space
do
you
see
a
vision
simpleton
but
nela
did
not
answer
her
mind
was
absorbed
in
self
contemplation
what
ails
me
she
asked
herself
it
can
not
be
anything
evil
or
wicked
for
i
do
not
feel
the
black
ugly
figure
of
a
devil
inside
me
but
something
heavenly
a
beautiful
face
a
smile
and
a
look
which
if
i
am
in
my
right
mind
are
those
of
the
virgin
mary
herself
oh
lady
mother
can
it
be
true
that
thou
wilt
give
me
comfort
and
how
by
giving
me
what
i
prayed
for
last
night
now
then
brat
screamed
se침ana
in
her
harsh
tones
like
a
cracked
bell
go
and
wash
your
ugly
little
snout
nela
went
at
once
her
spirit
had
felt
a
shock
as
of
a
sudden
gleam
of
great
hope
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
quivering
surface
of
the
water
and
her
heart
shrank
within
her
no
difference
she
muttered
as
ugly
as
ever
the
same
child
face
with
a
woman
years
and
a
woman
heart
but
after
washing
herself
she
went
through
the
same
experience
as
before
a
sort
of
agony
of
anticipation
and
in
spite
of
her
narrow
vocabulary
nela
could
classify
these
feelings
as
presentiments
pablo
and
i
said
she
to
herself
have
often
talked
of
how
we
feel
when
something
sad
or
something
pleasant
is
going
to
happen
pablo
told
me
that
just
before
an
earthquake
people
have
strange
sensations
there
is
something
in
the
air
and
the
beasts
feel
it
too
is
there
going
to
be
an
earthquake
i
wonder
and
she
knelt
down
and
felt
the
ground
with
her
hand
i
can
not
tell
but
something
is
going
to
happen
and
i
can
not
doubt
that
it
will
be
something
the
virgin
told
me
last
night
that
she
would
comfort
me
what
has
come
over
me
the
heavenly
queen
seems
to
be
close
to
me
i
can
not
see
her
but
i
feel
her
before
me
behind
me
she
went
close
by
the
machines
for
washing
the
ore
towards
the
inclined
plane
looking
about
her
with
eager
eyes
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
arms
and
wheels
of
iron
toiling
with
fiendish
shrieks
amid
the
hideous
confusion
of
whirling
cylinders
lashing
the
water
to
powder
as
it
seemed
and
breathing
out
dust
and
smoke
presently
when
she
had
gone
some
little
distance
she
stopped
putting
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
ground
in
all
the
bewilderment
of
doubt
the
question
is
said
she
to
herself
am
i
happy
or
am
i
sad
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
half
wondering
to
see
it
appear
the
same
as
on
other
days
and
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
then
she
walked
on
faster
to
reach
aldeacorba
as
soon
as
possible
instead
of
going
through
the
gallery
in
the
mines
and
up
the
wooden
steps
she
kept
above
the
hollow
way
along
by
the
gutter
that
bordered
the
inclined
intending
to
get
out
into
the
fields
and
walk
straight
on
by
the
level
road
to
the
village
this
way
was
much
the
prettiest
and
she
almost
always
chose
it
for
that
reason
it
went
by
lanes
full
of
sweet
and
gay
flowers
where
crowds
of
bees
and
butterflies
fluttered
and
sipped
there
were
thickets
of
bramble
loaded
with
the
black
fruit
beloved
of
children
clumps
of
overgrown
with
honeysuckles
and
enormous
ilex
tall
spreading
densely
shady
and
proud
it
would
seem
of
their
wide
black
shadows
here
nela
went
more
slowly
uneasy
in
herself
puzzled
at
her
own
sensations
and
at
the
anxious
excitement
that
stirred
in
her
her
rapid
fancy
presently
hit
upon
a
formula
to
express
the
state
of
her
feelings
and
remembering
having
heard
it
said
of
such
and
such
a
one
the
devil
is
in
him
she
said
to
herself
the
angels
are
in
me
the
virgin
mary
is
with
me
this
day
what
i
feel
are
the
wings
of
her
angels
fluttering
inside
me
thou
art
near
me
lady
mother
i
see
you
and
yet
i
do
not
see
you
as
we
see
with
our
eyes
shut
she
shut
her
eyes
and
then
she
opened
them
again
she
had
just
passed
a
grove
of
trees
and
turned
an
angle
of
the
road
to
go
to
a
place
where
she
knew
of
a
bramble
copse
the
greenest
prettiest
and
most
fruitful
in
all
the
neighborhood
there
were
luxuriant
ferns
too
honeysuckle
wild
vine
and
other
climbing
plants
all
clinging
and
tangled
together
in
mutual
dependence
nela
heard
a
rustle
in
the
brushwood
close
to
her
and
turning
round
she
saw
merciful
heaven
there
in
a
frame
of
greenery
stood
the
immaculate
virgin
herself
the
face
the
eyes
which
in
their
gaze
seemed
to
have
all
the
calm
beauty
of
the
sky
nela
stood
silent
petrified
with
a
feeling
at
once
of
devotion
and
terror
she
could
not
stir
nor
cry
out
nor
hardly
breathe
nor
take
her
eyes
off
this
beatific
vision
it
stood
among
the
verdure
the
face
and
figure
to
the
waist
perfectly
displayed
this
was
yes
certainly
the
very
presence
of
the
maiden
of
nazareth
whose
moral
loveliness
every
painter
has
endeavored
to
express
by
means
of
physical
beauty
from
luke
downwards
through
eighteen
centuries
have
not
men
indeed
seen
that
sacred
form
with
the
eyes
of
sense
with
the
eyes
of
albert
d칲rer
of
rafael
of
van
eyck
of
bartolom칠
murillo
it
was
under
the
rafaelesque
aspect
that
she
now
appeared
to
nela
the
most
realistic
of
all
if
realism
can
mean
the
nearest
approach
of
perfect
human
beauty
to
an
artistic
representation
of
divine
goodness
the
oval
of
her
face
was
less
narrow
than
the
seville
painter
type
and
had
more
of
the
tender
roundness
of
the
italian
form
her
eyes
which
were
finely
shaped
were
gentleness
itself
with
a
softness
and
sweetness
as
far
removed
from
indifference
as
from
the
lightning
glow
of
the
eyes
of
andalucia
the
brows
that
overarched
them
were
delicately
curved
and
as
fine
as
if
they
had
been
traced
with
a
her
forehead
was
unshadowed
by
any
cloud
of
weariness
or
sadness
and
her
lips
which
were
rather
full
parted
in
a
smile
that
revealed
the
pearliest
teeth
that
ever
bit
into
the
apples
of
paradise
and
so
without
in
the
least
intending
it
i
have
compared
her
to
our
mother
eve
wide
as
the
distance
is
between
her
who
yielded
to
the
serpent
and
her
who
set
her
heel
on
his
head
but
the
beauty
of
a
lovely
girl
is
enough
to
betray
us
into
such
unlucky
blunders
to
put
a
finishing
touch
to
this
imperfect
description
of
the
divine
vision
which
had
so
utterly
dismayed
poor
marianela
it
must
be
said
that
her
complexion
was
of
that
faded
rose
color
or
warm
clear
brown
which
gives
an
enchanting
glow
to
the
faces
of
those
glorious
pictures
which
successive
generations
of
believers
and
heretics
alike
have
worshipped
in
ecstasy
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
was
over
the
first
thing
that
nela
observed
and
which
confused
her
judgment
greatly
was
that
the
fair
virgin
wore
a
blue
ribbon
round
her
throat
a
detail
she
had
never
before
seen
in
any
picture
or
dream
of
the
virgin
mary
then
she
perceived
that
her
shoulders
and
bosom
were
covered
by
a
dress
in
every
respect
similar
to
that
worn
by
other
ladies
but
the
thing
which
puzzled
and
disturbed
her
most
was
that
the
fair
creature
was
picking
blackberries
and
eating
them
she
was
beginning
to
draw
accurate
inferences
from
this
remarkable
behavior
when
she
heard
a
loud
man
voice
calling
florentina
florentina
i
am
here
papa
here
eating
blackberries
naughty
child
how
can
you
like
to
eat
blackberries
what
next
whim
will
you
take
have
i
not
told
you
that
they
are
only
fit
for
the
poor
children
that
run
about
the
country
and
not
for
a
young
lady
who
has
been
properly
brought
do
you
hear
and
lived
in
good
society
nela
saw
the
speaker
come
towards
them
he
was
a
man
of
advanced
middle
age
and
medium
height
rotund
and
with
a
ruddy
countenance
that
seemed
to
radiate
satisfaction
as
the
sun
radiates
light
his
legs
were
thin
his
nose
was
large
and
his
person
decorated
with
a
variety
of
splendid
objects
among
which
a
thick
was
conspicuous
while
he
wore
a
hat
of
fine
black
felt
come
come
child
said
don
manuel
pen치guilas
for
he
it
was
respectable
people
do
not
eat
blackberries
nor
skip
and
jump
about
like
that
there
you
have
torn
your
dress
i
do
not
care
about
the
dress
for
i
can
buy
you
another
as
i
bought
you
that
i
only
speak
because
the
people
here
who
see
you
might
think
you
had
no
dress
but
the
one
you
have
on
nela
who
by
this
time
understood
the
case
looked
at
the
young
dress
it
was
good
and
handsome
but
her
face
betrayed
unmistakably
the
transition
and
a
rapid
one
from
the
position
of
a
rich
daughter
to
that
of
a
fine
lady
every
detail
of
her
attire
from
her
shoes
to
her
comb
stamped
her
as
the
daughter
of
the
people
in
holiday
clothes
but
the
girl
natural
grace
and
beauty
were
so
transcendent
that
no
deficiency
as
measured
by
any
conventional
standard
of
elegance
could
dim
them
it
was
not
to
be
denied
however
that
her
whole
individuality
cried
out
for
a
short
peasant
skirt
hair
dressed
in
plaits
with
a
bunch
of
poppies
to
adorn
it
with
affected
simplicity
a
sleeveless
bodice
a
coral
necklace
in
short
the
costume
which
good
taste
and
the
nature
of
things
would
have
suggested
without
any
admixture
of
the
devices
of
the
fine
lady
as
the
young
girl
came
out
from
among
the
brambles
don
manuel
perceived
nela
at
the
moment
when
she
had
just
recovered
from
her
delusion
and
he
called
out
as
he
turned
to
her
hallo
and
who
are
you
why
look
florentina
it
is
nela
the
little
body
that
waits
upon
your
cousin
you
remember
i
spoke
of
her
to
you
and
how
are
you
very
well
se침or
don
manuel
and
how
are
you
se침or
asked
mariquilla
without
taking
her
eyes
off
florentina
perfectly
well
as
you
see
this
is
my
well
what
do
you
think
of
her
florentina
had
just
set
out
on
a
butterfly
chase
my
dear
child
where
are
you
going
what
do
you
want
now
said
the
father
visibly
annoyed
now
do
you
think
it
looks
well
that
you
should
be
running
after
an
insect
like
some
poor
child
you
must
not
be
so
wild
my
child
young
ladies
brought
up
in
good
society
do
not
do
such
things
never
do
such
things
it
was
a
trick
with
don
manuel
to
repeat
the
last
clause
of
his
sentences
to
give
them
emphasis
ah
do
not
be
cross
papa
said
the
girl
returning
from
her
fruitless
chase
to
shelter
herself
under
the
protecting
brim
of
the
paternal
hat
you
know
how
much
i
love
the
country
and
that
i
am
half
crazy
when
i
see
trees
and
flowers
and
meadows
and
in
that
dismal
town
of
camp칩
i
never
see
anything
of
the
kind
oh
but
you
must
not
say
anything
against
santa
irene
de
camp칩
it
is
a
famous
town
where
you
find
every
comfort
and
convenience
and
a
great
deal
of
very
distinguished
society
it
stands
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
civilization
yes
of
civilization
you
can
admire
the
beauties
of
nature
while
you
walk
properly
by
my
side
i
admire
them
too
but
without
cutting
capers
or
turning
somersaults
you
can
tell
when
a
young
person
has
moved
in
good
society
only
by
her
way
of
walking
and
looking
at
the
scene
around
her
this
way
of
calling
out
at
every
minute
ah
oh
look
there
papa
how
pretty
and
pointing
to
a
fern
perhaps
or
an
or
a
rock
a
even
a
brook
is
not
at
all
in
good
taste
people
will
think
you
have
lived
in
a
desert
so
come
and
walk
by
nela
will
show
us
the
way
home
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
know
where
we
are
if
we
turn
to
the
left
past
that
old
house
said
nela
readily
we
shall
be
there
but
here
comes
don
francisco
and
in
fact
don
francisco
came
on
towards
them
calling
out
the
chocolate
is
getting
cold
what
would
you
have
my
good
this
child
was
so
anxious
to
scamper
across
the
country
that
she
would
not
wait
so
we
went
springing
from
bush
to
bush
like
goats
just
like
goats
from
bush
to
bush
well
come
in
now
come
home
nela
do
you
come
too
and
have
some
chocolate
said
pen치guilas
laying
a
hand
on
the
child
head
well
and
what
do
you
think
of
my
niece
is
not
she
pretty
florentina
when
you
have
had
your
chocolate
nela
will
take
you
and
pablo
for
a
walk
and
you
will
see
all
the
beauties
of
the
neighborhood
the
mines
the
wood
the
river
florentina
sent
a
kind
glance
to
the
hapless
little
creature
who
as
she
ran
by
her
side
seemed
to
have
been
formed
by
nature
expressly
as
a
foil
and
contrast
to
one
of
the
loveliest
and
most
perfect
of
her
creations
when
they
reached
the
house
the
table
was
ready
laid
with
the
chocolate
pots
full
of
the
thick
and
nutritious
beverage
and
a
small
hillock
of
slices
of
bread
there
too
were
the
a
sort
of
cake
duly
decked
with
fern
leaves
and
no
lack
of
other
household
dainties
the
bright
glasses
of
crystal
water
reflected
and
magnified
all
these
gastronomical
objects
here
we
have
something
to
support
life
said
don
francisco
seating
himself
and
you
will
have
some
chocolate
too
nela
said
pablo
he
had
hardly
spoken
when
florentina
had
offered
her
the
chocolate
pot
and
everything
that
was
on
the
table
was
pressed
on
her
acceptance
she
refused
at
first
but
the
se침orita
insisted
with
so
much
kindness
and
gentle
grace
that
she
had
at
last
no
choice
don
manuel
cast
side
glances
at
his
daughter
not
feeling
perfectly
satisfied
with
her
advance
in
the
arts
and
manners
of
the
best
society
since
one
of
the
most
important
points
in
his
estimation
consisted
in
a
delicate
appreciation
of
the
shades
of
civility
due
to
different
people
according
to
their
rank
and
position
showing
to
each
neither
more
nor
less
than
was
appropriate
by
the
rules
of
social
distinction
since
by
this
means
each
would
keep
his
place
while
true
dignity
would
hold
its
own
and
observe
that
happy
medium
of
courtesy
which
was
not
too
haughty
or
reserved
to
the
rich
nor
too
humble
and
condescending
to
the
poor
not
too
humble
to
the
poor
when
they
had
done
breakfast
don
francisco
said
now
you
children
go
out
for
a
walk
pablo
this
is
the
last
day
that
don
teodoro
will
allow
you
to
walk
out
you
three
go
and
have
a
run
while
my
brother
and
i
go
over
the
fly
away
birds
there
was
no
need
to
speak
twice
the
beauty
of
the
day
was
invitation
enough
and
the
three
young
people
set
out
for
the
fields
chapter
xv
the
three
children
the
damsel
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
open
and
smiling
meadows
without
the
trammels
of
her
father
social
dogmas
and
as
soon
as
they
were
at
some
little
distance
from
the
house
she
took
to
running
and
leaping
swinging
now
and
then
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
as
she
passed
them
she
pinched
the
blackberries
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
when
she
thought
them
ripe
she
would
pick
three
one
for
each
mouth
this
is
for
you
cousin
she
said
putting
it
to
his
lips
and
this
is
for
you
nela
and
this
little
one
is
for
me
then
as
the
birds
flew
across
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
wave
her
arms
as
if
she
too
could
fly
where
are
the
little
rascals
off
to
i
wonder
she
said
she
must
need
gather
a
branch
from
every
and
split
open
the
acorns
to
see
what
was
in
them
then
she
bit
into
one
and
finding
it
bitter
tossed
it
away
no
botanist
mad
on
latin
names
and
classification
could
have
been
so
eager
to
collect
all
the
flowers
that
grew
under
her
feet
as
if
to
bid
her
welcome
to
their
native
soil
and
she
gathered
enough
in
half
an
hour
to
adorn
every
in
her
cousin
cloak
to
make
a
garland
for
hair
and
then
one
for
her
own
my
cousin
would
like
to
see
the
mines
said
pablo
do
not
you
think
we
might
go
down
yes
let
us
go
down
this
way
se침orita
oh
but
i
do
not
like
to
go
through
tunnels
they
frighten
me
dreadfully
i
really
can
not
go
through
a
tunnel
said
florentina
following
them
cousin
do
you
and
nela
walk
about
here
often
oh
but
this
is
beautiful
i
could
live
here
all
my
life
blessings
on
the
man
who
is
going
to
give
you
the
power
of
enjoying
this
lovely
world
god
grant
it
and
it
will
all
look
much
more
lovely
to
me
who
have
never
seen
it
than
to
you
who
are
tired
of
it
all
but
do
not
suppose
florentina
that
i
do
not
understand
what
beauty
is
i
can
feel
it
in
my
own
fashion
and
my
fancy
almost
almost
makes
up
for
my
want
of
sight
that
is
but
say
what
you
will
replied
florentina
we
will
have
some
good
fun
when
you
can
see
maybe
said
the
blind
boy
that
i
may
not
find
much
to
say
that
day
nela
meanwhile
was
absolutely
speechless
when
they
had
reached
the
crater
of
la
terrible
florentina
was
greatly
struck
by
the
grand
spectacle
of
the
limestone
rocks
left
on
the
ground
after
the
ore
had
been
extracted
she
compared
them
to
huge
masses
of
sugar
loaves
piled
one
on
another
then
after
looking
a
second
time
she
said
they
were
like
gigantic
dogs
and
cats
turned
to
stone
at
the
critical
moment
of
a
furious
fight
let
us
sit
down
on
this
slope
she
said
and
we
shall
see
the
trains
go
by
with
the
mineral
and
besides
we
can
see
these
stones
which
are
very
curious
that
large
rock
in
the
middle
has
a
wide
mouth
do
you
see
nela
and
out
of
the
mouth
sticks
a
toothpick
it
is
a
tree
that
has
grown
all
alone
there
it
looks
as
if
it
were
laughing
at
us
for
it
has
eyes
too
and
there
farther
on
is
one
with
a
hump
another
smoking
a
pipe
and
two
pulling
each
other
hair
there
is
one
yawning
another
asleep
and
drunk
and
another
head
downwards
supporting
a
cathedral
on
his
feet
then
there
is
one
playing
the
guitar
with
a
dog
head
and
on
it
like
a
cap
what
you
are
saying
observed
the
blind
man
proves
to
me
how
differently
things
are
seen
by
different
eyes
and
that
the
precious
gift
of
sight
sometimes
travesties
them
strangely
changing
their
natural
form
into
something
whimsical
and
unreal
for
after
all
what
you
see
before
you
are
neither
cats
nor
men
toothpicks
cathedrals
nor
but
merely
limestone
rocks
and
masses
of
calcareous
stone
stained
with
oxide
of
iron
and
it
is
your
eye
that
burlesques
so
simple
a
fact
you
are
right
cousin
and
for
that
very
reason
i
say
it
is
our
imagination
that
sees
and
not
our
eyes
nevertheless
our
sight
is
useful
to
inform
us
for
instance
of
certain
things
which
poor
people
have
not
got
and
which
we
who
are
rich
can
give
them
and
as
she
spoke
she
touched
nela
dress
why
does
not
this
dear
little
nela
wear
better
clothes
she
went
on
i
have
a
number
of
frocks
and
i
will
give
her
one
and
a
new
one
too
into
the
bargain
marianela
covered
with
blushes
and
confusion
did
not
raise
her
eyes
that
is
a
thing
i
can
never
understand
why
some
have
so
much
and
others
so
little
i
get
quite
angry
with
papa
when
i
hear
him
abusing
those
who
wish
that
everything
should
be
divided
so
that
all
should
have
an
equal
share
what
do
they
call
those
people
pablo
socialists
communists
said
the
lad
smiling
well
those
are
the
people
for
me
i
vote
for
a
redistribution
so
that
the
rich
should
give
the
poor
all
they
have
too
much
of
why
should
this
orphan
go
barefoot
when
i
wear
shoes
even
wicked
people
ought
not
to
be
destitute
much
less
good
ones
now
i
know
that
nela
is
very
good
you
told
me
so
last
evening
and
your
father
said
so
too
and
she
has
no
parents
no
one
to
care
for
her
how
is
it
that
there
are
so
many
many
miserable
creatures
in
the
world
my
bread
burns
my
mouth
when
i
remember
how
many
there
are
who
have
none
at
all
poor
little
nela
such
a
good
child
and
so
forlorn
it
seems
impossible
that
to
this
day
you
should
have
lived
without
being
loved
without
any
one
to
give
you
a
kiss
nor
to
cuddle
and
pet
you
as
we
pet
little
children
my
heart
aches
to
think
of
it
marianela
was
as
completely
petrified
with
astonishment
as
at
the
first
sight
of
the
apparition
then
she
had
seen
the
virgin
mary
now
she
heard
her
very
words
listen
little
one
the
holy
maiden
went
on
and
you
pablo
listen
too
i
must
help
and
comfort
nela
not
as
we
help
the
beggars
by
the
road
but
as
we
try
to
help
a
brother
whom
we
find
unexpectedly
did
you
not
tell
me
that
she
has
been
your
companion
your
your
guide
through
the
darkness
that
you
saw
with
her
eyes
and
trod
in
her
steps
nela
is
mine
as
much
as
yours
then
and
i
shall
take
charge
of
her
i
will
dress
her
and
give
her
everything
she
can
want
to
live
decently
and
teach
her
a
hundred
things
to
make
her
useful
in
the
house
papa
told
me
that
perhaps
i
might
always
have
to
live
here
and
if
so
nela
will
live
with
me
with
me
she
will
learn
to
read
to
say
her
prayers
to
sew
and
to
cook
she
will
learn
so
many
things
that
she
will
know
as
much
as
i
do
what
do
you
think
of
my
plan
she
will
soon
be
nothing
short
of
a
young
lady
my
father
will
not
prevent
me
i
know
indeed
last
evening
he
said
to
me
perhaps
perhaps
before
long
i
shall
not
rule
you
any
longer
you
may
have
to
obey
another
master
well
be
that
as
it
may
nela
shall
be
my
friend
will
you
love
me
dearly
you
have
lived
so
neglected
as
the
wild
flowers
grow
in
the
fields
that
you
do
not
even
know
how
to
say
thank
you
but
never
mind
i
will
teach
you
oh
i
have
to
teach
you
so
many
things
marianela
who
had
been
making
stupendous
efforts
not
to
cry
as
she
listened
to
these
splendid
promises
could
at
last
hold
in
no
longer
and
after
screwing
up
her
face
for
a
minute
burst
into
tears
the
blind
boy
sat
silent
lost
in
thought
florentina
he
said
presently
you
speak
and
think
differently
from
most
other
people
your
goodness
is
as
infinite
and
as
enthusiastic
as
that
which
has
filled
the
world
with
martyrs
and
peopled
heaven
with
saints
what
an
extravagant
way
of
putting
it
said
the
girl
laughing
and
she
rose
to
gather
a
flower
that
had
attracted
her
attention
at
some
little
distance
is
she
gone
asked
pablo
yes
said
nela
gulping
down
her
tears
do
you
know
said
pablo
i
fancy
my
cousin
must
be
rather
pretty
when
she
arrived
last
evening
i
felt
the
greatest
antipathy
towards
her
i
can
not
tell
you
what
a
dislike
i
took
to
her
but
i
fancy
i
can
see
her
and
that
she
must
be
rather
pretty
nela
began
to
cry
again
she
is
like
an
angel
she
said
with
a
flood
of
tears
she
looks
as
if
she
had
just
come
straight
from
heaven
body
and
soul
she
is
exactly
like
the
holy
virgin
mary
oh
do
not
exaggerate
said
pablo
uneasily
she
can
not
be
so
lovely
as
you
say
do
not
imagine
that
because
i
have
no
eyes
i
can
not
feel
who
is
beautiful
and
who
is
not
no
no
you
can
not
feel
it
you
do
not
oh
you
are
mistaken
quite
mistaken
no
no
she
can
not
be
so
beautiful
the
blind
lad
insisted
turning
very
pale
as
he
spoke
nela
darling
of
my
heart
do
you
know
what
my
father
told
me
that
if
i
recover
my
sight
i
am
to
marry
florentina
nela
could
not
answer
her
tears
continued
to
flow
in
silence
pouring
down
her
burning
cheeks
and
dropping
on
her
hands
but
not
even
the
bitterest
tears
could
give
expression
or
relief
to
her
intense
grief
it
was
immeasurable
infinite
that
was
all
she
knew
i
know
why
you
are
crying
so
much
the
blind
youth
said
holding
her
hands
very
tightly
in
his
own
but
my
father
will
not
insist
on
making
me
marry
against
my
will
for
me
there
is
no
wife
in
the
world
but
you
when
my
eyes
can
see
they
will
care
for
no
beauty
but
your
heavenly
face
all
others
will
be
but
shades
too
remote
and
dim
to
attract
my
gaze
oh
god
what
is
a
human
face
like
how
does
the
soul
stand
revealed
in
flesh
if
light
can
not
avail
to
give
another
aspect
to
thought
and
fancy
of
what
use
is
it
at
all
that
which
we
conceive
of
and
that
which
is
are
they
not
one
and
the
same
thing
are
not
the
idea
and
the
form
the
same
to
each
other
as
fire
and
heat
can
they
be
separated
and
can
you
cease
to
be
the
fairest
in
the
world
to
me
the
sweetest
and
best
beloved
when
i
am
lord
of
the
vast
domain
of
the
visible
florentina
now
rejoined
them
and
they
talked
as
they
went
home
but
nothing
more
was
said
of
sufficient
interest
to
be
set
down
here
chapter
xvi
the
vow
nothing
of
importance
occurred
on
the
two
following
days
but
then
there
came
one
on
which
the
deed
was
done
the
wonderful
crowning
fateful
deed
teodoro
golfin
in
whose
hands
the
surgeon
knife
was
as
the
chisel
of
a
genius
had
attempted
to
amend
one
of
nature
most
delicate
works
unflinching
and
calm
he
took
possession
as
it
were
in
virtue
of
his
science
and
experience
of
the
marvellous
speck
in
which
the
glorious
scheme
of
the
universe
is
epitomized
and
concentrated
the
task
before
him
was
nothing
less
than
to
stand
face
to
face
with
the
mystery
of
life
to
investigate
and
discover
the
causes
which
hindered
a
living
eye
from
taking
cognizance
of
things
visible
for
this
a
firm
soul
was
needed
and
a
tender
hand
the
delicate
tissue
of
the
cornea
must
be
divided
the
crystalline
lens
removed
carefully
avoiding
the
hyaloid
membrane
and
the
vitreous
humor
the
dimensions
of
the
pupil
must
be
increased
by
an
incision
and
the
condition
of
the
inner
chamber
of
the
eye
ascertained
by
induction
or
by
examination
few
words
were
spoken
after
this
daring
expedition
into
a
microcosm
an
enterprise
not
less
bold
than
the
attempt
to
measure
the
distance
between
the
stars
or
to
gauge
the
infinite
realms
of
space
those
who
were
present
sat
in
silent
suspense
as
they
might
await
the
resurrection
of
a
dead
man
or
the
creation
of
a
new
world
golfin
said
nothing
definite
either
iris
contractile
he
muttered
retina
sensitive
nerves
living
and
sound
and
yet
the
function
the
fact
the
act
of
seeing
where
was
that
time
will
show
said
don
teodoro
as
he
carefully
adjusted
the
bandages
patience
and
his
leonine
face
expressed
neither
disappointment
nor
triumph
neither
hope
nor
doubt
science
had
done
all
she
could
it
was
almost
like
an
act
of
creation
like
many
others
she
has
enabled
us
to
perform
in
this
nineteenth
century
nature
thus
boldly
defied
and
resenting
such
an
intrusion
on
her
secrets
held
her
peace
the
patient
was
strictly
forbidden
to
see
any
one
but
his
father
who
waited
on
him
no
one
else
was
admitted
nela
went
several
times
to
enquire
for
the
invalid
but
she
never
crossed
the
threshold
she
waited
outside
till
don
manuel
should
come
out
or
his
daughter
or
some
member
of
the
household
the
young
lady
after
giving
her
the
fullest
information
and
painting
in
lively
colors
the
anxiety
they
all
felt
would
go
out
to
walk
with
her
one
day
florentina
insisted
that
nela
should
show
her
where
she
lived
and
they
went
down
to
hovel
the
squalid
interior
horrified
and
disgusted
florentina
above
all
the
baskets
which
served
as
the
orphan
bed
well
nela
will
very
soon
come
to
live
with
me
said
florentina
getting
out
of
the
stuffy
hole
as
fast
as
she
could
and
then
she
will
have
a
bedroom
just
like
mine
and
will
dress
and
feed
as
i
do
dame
centeno
and
her
two
girls
stood
with
astonishment
at
this
speech
they
began
to
think
that
the
hapless
and
neglected
orphan
must
have
found
her
father
in
some
prince
or
king
as
the
orphans
do
in
the
tales
when
they
had
left
the
house
behind
them
florentina
said
to
her
companion
pray
to
god
day
and
night
that
he
may
grant
my
dear
cousin
the
blessing
which
we
all
enjoy
and
which
he
has
denied
to
him
what
an
anxious
state
we
live
in
if
he
gains
his
sight
a
thousand
delightful
things
will
follow
and
many
difficulties
will
be
removed
i
have
made
a
solemn
vow
to
the
virgin
i
have
promised
that
if
she
grants
my
cousin
his
sight
i
will
take
under
my
care
the
very
poorest
creature
i
can
find
and
give
her
all
that
can
make
her
entirely
forget
her
poverty
making
her
my
own
equal
in
every
respect
as
happy
and
as
comfortable
as
i
am
and
it
is
not
enough
merely
to
give
her
clothes
or
set
her
down
to
a
table
with
plenty
of
soup
and
meat
no
there
is
another
charity
which
is
worth
more
than
all
the
broken
food
and
frippery
in
the
world
kindness
respect
consideration
and
a
name
i
will
give
her
these
too
and
teach
her
to
respect
herself
i
have
found
the
person
i
want
mar칤a
it
is
you
i
have
promised
the
holy
virgin
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
that
if
she
will
bestow
the
gift
of
sight
on
my
cousin
you
shall
be
my
sister
you
shall
be
the
same
as
myself
in
my
house
exactly
like
my
sister
as
she
spoke
nela
virgin
clasped
the
girl
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
idea
of
the
poor
little
feelings
in
this
crowning
hour
of
her
life
an
instinctive
dread
kept
her
away
from
the
house
at
aldeacorba
a
dread
that
was
dimly
mixed
up
with
the
personality
of
her
young
benefactress
like
the
figures
we
see
in
a
nightmare
while
at
the
same
time
she
felt
tender
admiration
and
reverence
for
her
now
and
again
in
her
innocent
bewilderment
she
fancied
it
must
be
the
virgin
mary
in
her
actual
presence
in
no
other
way
could
she
conceive
of
the
which
smiled
upon
her
like
the
realms
of
paradise
from
the
open
soul
of
florentina
with
its
purity
tenderness
gentleness
and
gracious
consolations
honest
instinct
made
her
feel
and
understand
at
once
that
she
could
not
hate
her
sister
hate
her
how
could
she
she
felt
she
must
love
her
with
all
the
strength
of
her
soul
her
aversion
and
repulsion
sank
to
the
bottom
like
a
sediment
after
fermentation
and
there
decomposed
and
vanished
their
elements
recombining
to
intensify
the
admiration
and
respect
she
felt
for
her
benefactress
still
though
the
feeling
had
disappeared
the
cause
remained
the
sentiment
which
as
it
could
no
longer
flourish
singly
in
her
soul
with
that
masterful
exclusiveness
which
is
characteristic
of
such
passions
revenged
itself
by
producing
that
utter
dejection
which
is
the
very
demon
of
melancholy
at
centeno
they
remarked
that
nela
did
not
eat
that
she
seemed
wearier
than
usual
that
for
long
intervals
she
sat
as
silent
and
motionless
as
a
statue
and
that
she
sang
no
longer
day
or
night
her
incapacity
for
exertion
had
become
absolute
helplessness
and
tanasio
having
sent
her
to
buy
him
some
tobacco
she
sat
down
in
the
road
and
remained
there
for
the
rest
of
the
day
one
morning
just
a
week
after
the
operation
had
been
performed
she
went
up
to
the
engineer
house
and
sof칤a
said
to
her
a
gift
for
good
news
nela
have
you
heard
they
have
taken
off
the
bandages
and
they
say
he
can
see
that
he
will
see

well
ulysses
the
foreman
of
the
works
has
just
been
to
tell
us

not
been
here
but
my
husband
has
gone
to
aldeacorba
we
shall
know
the
truth
very
soon
nela
as
she
heard
it
felt
more
dead
than
alive
and
crossing
her
hands
she
exclaimed
blessed
be
the
holy
virgin
who
has
worked
this
wonder
she
she
alone
has
done
it
you
are
glad
little
one

wonder
for
now

promise

sof칤a
in
a
bantering
tone

me
to
congratulate

why
it
is
like
a
lottery

a
big
prize

not
be
grateful
no
you
will
not
i
never

any
poor

grateful
they
are
all
proud
and
the
more
you
give
them
the
more
they
well
it
is
a
settled
thing
that
pablo
is
to
marry
his
cousin
and
it
is
a
very
good
match
they
are
a
handsome
pair
and
she
seems
no
fool
and
she
has
a
sweet
pretty
face
what
a
pity
to
spoil
such
a
face
and
figure
by
dressing
so
villanously
no
no
if
i
want
to
dress
well
i
will
not
apply
to
the
dressmaker
at
santa
irene

as
she
spoke
don

was
radiant
with
satisfaction
and
delight

complete
success

shouted
as
he
reached
the
door

brother

is
quite
certain
as
sure
as

i
never
believed
it
could
and
what
a
triumph

what
a
triumph
it
is
my
greatest
pride
and
happiness
to
be
my
brother

chapter
xvii
a
fugitive
the
wonderful
good
news
flew
through
socartes
nothing
else
was
talked
of
in
the
in
the
workshops
in
the
on
the
in
the
deepest
diggings
and
on
the
top
of
the
hill
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
or
the
open
light
of
heaven
various
interesting
commentaries
were
added
that
in
aldeacorba
it
was
thought
for
a
moment
that
don
francisco
was
out
of
his
wits
with
joy
that
don
manuel
meant
to
celebrate
the
happy
event
by
giving
a
grand
banquet
to
all
the
hands
employed
in
the
mines
and
finally
that
don
teodoro
was
a
great
man
whom
all
blind
men
present
or
to
come
might
indeed
esteem
as
the
apple
of
their
eye
nela
could
not
venture
to
go
to
the
house
at
aldeacorba
a
mysterious
force
seemed
to
hold
her
back
she
wandered
all
day
round
and
about
the
mines
gazing
from
afar
at
the
pen치guilas
house
which
in
her
eyes
looked
transformed
her
spirit
was
full
of
a
strange
compound
of
the
sincerest
joy
and
an
overwhelming
shamefacedness
of
noble
devotion
and
with
it
the
unendurable
aching
so
to
speak
of
an
intensely
sensitive
she
found
some
surcease
from
the
turmoil
of
her
brain
in
that
motherly
solitude
which
had
contributed
so
largely
to
the
formation
of
her
character
and
in
dreaming
over
the
beauty
of
nature
which
always
lifted
her
soul
to
closer
communion
with
the
divinity
the
clouds
in
the
sky
and
the
flowers
of
the
field
affected
her
mind
as
others
are
affected
by
the
pomp
of
altars
the
eloquence
of
preachers
and
the
study
of
the
meditations
of
the
mystics
in
the
solitude
of
the
open
country
she
thought
and
said
a
thousand
things
that
she
never
dreamed
were
aspirations
and
prayers
she
looked
towards
aldeacorba
and
said
to
herself
i
will
never
go
there
all
is
over
and
of
what
use
can
i
be
now
with
all
her
ignorance
she
understood
that
the
struggle
in
her
soul
arose
from
her
incapacity
to
hate
any
one
on
the
contrary
she
was
constrained
to
love
her
friend
and
her
enemy
alike
and
just
as
thistles
turned
into
flowers
under
the
miraculous
touch
of
some
christian
martyr
nela
perceived
that
her
jealousy
and
aversion
were
graciously
blossoming
into
admiration
and
gratitude
that
which
could
undergo
no
change
was
the
feeling
we
have
described
as
shame
and
which
urged
her
to
keep
herself
quite
apart
from
any
events
which
might
henceforth
occur
in
aldeacorba
it
was
a
special
aspect
of
the
sentiment
which
in
civilized
and
educated
persons
is
called
which
includes
in
itself
the
capacity
for
the
connection
however
between
her
feeling
and
that
which
has
so
large
a
share
in
the
actions
of
cultivated
persons
consisted
in
the
fact
that
both
were
founded
on
a
punctilious
sense
of
dignity
if
marianela
could
have
expressed
herself
in
their
language
she
would
have
said
my
dignity
will
not
allow
me
to
submit
to
the
horrible
degradation
you
would
put
upon
me
it
is
god
will
that
i
should
endure
this
humiliation
so
be
it
but
i
can
not
stand
by
and
see
myself
deposed
and
discrowned
may
his
blessings
fall
on
the
head
of
her
who
by
a
law
of
nature
must
fill
the
place
i
once
occupied
but
i
have
not
the
courage
to
put
her
there
with
my
own
hands
but
not
being
able
to
utter
her
pain
in
these
words
she
could
only
say
i
will
never
go
to
aldeacorba
again
i
will
never
let
him
see
me
i
will
run
away
with
celipin
or
i
will
go
to
my
mother
i
am
of
no
use
now
to
any
one
still
even
while
she
said
this
it
struck
her
as
very
sad
that
she
should
have
to
give
up
the
divine
protection
of
that
heavenly
maiden
who
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
darkest
hour
of
her
life
and
cast
her
sheltering
mantle
over
her
to
think
that
after
seeing
the
vision
realized
which
had
so
often
appeared
to
her
in
dreams
of
thrilling
beatitude
she
must
renounce
it
to
have
heard
herself
called
by
a
gentle
voice
that
offered
her
a
sister
love
a
happy
home
position
a
name
and
a
luxurious
existence
and
then
be
unable
to
obey
the
invitation
with
joy
alacrity
and
thankfulness
to
reject
the
hand
which
would
snatch
her
from
a
life
of
degradation
and
misery
and
make
a
lady
of
the
wretched
vagabond
raising
her
from
the
rank
of
a
domestic
animal
to
that
of
a
loved
and
respected
woman
woe
woe
she
cried
clutching
her
bosom
as
if
her
fingers
were
talons
i
can
not
never
never
nothing
in
the
world
shall
ever
take
me
to
aldeacorba
virgin
mother
of
my
soul
take
me
take
me
mother
will
you
not
come
and
fetch
me
as
night
came
on
she
went
home
on
her
way
she
met
celipin
with
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
his
cap
hung
on
the
end
of
it
look
here
nelilla
said
the
boy
is
not
this
how
don
teodoro
carries
his
hat
just
now
i
was
passing
the
pool
at
hinojales
and
i
looked
at
my
reflection
in
the
water
my
was
not
i
surprised
i
thought
i
looked
just
like
don
teodoro
golfin
some
day
this
week
we
will
set
out
to
become
learned
and
useful
persons
i
have
got
as
much
money
now
as
i
want
and
you
will
see
no
one
will
dare
to
laugh
at
se침or
de
celipin
for
three
days
nela
kept
out
of
the
way
wandering
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
mines
following
the
course
of
the
river
along
its
rugged
banks
or
hiding
herself
in
the
quiet
recesses
of
the
wood
of
saldeoro
the
nights
she
spent
in
her
basket
but
she
could
not
sleep
one
night
she
timidly
called
her
companion
celipin
when
and
celipin
replied
with
all
the
solemnity
befitting
a
regular
expedition
the
two
adventurers
rose
at
and
both
went
their
way
celipin
to
his
work
and
nela
to
carry
a
message
from
se침ana
to
the
housekeeper
on
her
return
she
found
se침orita
florentina
who
was
waiting
for
her
at
centeno
house
mar칤a
was
surprised
and
alarmed
at
seeing
her
though
her
instinct
told
her
of
the
end
and
object
of
this
visit
nela
my
little
sister
said
the
girl
with
engaging
gentleness
why
are
you
behaving
so
strangely
why
have
you
not
been
near
us
all
these
days
come
pablo
wishes
to
see
you
do
you
not
know
that
now
he
can
say
want
to
see
this
thing
or
the
other
do
you
not
know
that
my
cousin
is
no
longer
blind
yes
i
know
it
said
nela
taking
the
hand
florentina
held
out
to
her
and
covering
it
with
kisses
come
along
then
come
at
once
he
is
always
asking
for
nela
and
you
must
be
there
when
don
teodoro
takes
the
bandage
off
it
is
the
fourth
time
oh
the
first
day
when
he
first
tried
it
what
a
day
that
was
when
we
knew
for
certain
that
my
cousin
was
born
again
as
i
may
say
to
the
light
of
day
we
almost
died
of
and
the
first
face
he
saw
was
come
along
quickly
but
mar칤a
drew
her
hand
out
of
her
virgin
clasp
have
you
forgotten
my
promise
my
vow
florentina
went
on
or
did
you
think
i
was
talking
at
random
but
indeed
nothing
i
can
do
seems
enough
to
show
our
mother
of
mercies
my
gratitude
for
the
grace
she
has
shown
us
i
should
like
that
on
this
day
not
a
creature
that
the
whole
world
contains
should
be
sad
i
should
like
to
divide
my
happiness
and
fling
it
abroad
on
all
sides
as
the
sower
casts
the
seed
i
should
like
to
go
into
every
wretched
dwelling
and
say
your
troubles
are
ended
i
have
a
remedy
for
them
all
but
it
is
impossible
no
one
can
do
that
but
god
still
as
my
powers
are
not
equal
to
my
will
let
me
at
any
rate
do
what
i
can
and
these
are
not
mere
words
nela
come
with
me
away
from
this
hovel
bid
farewell
to
everything
that
has
made
part
of
your
misery
and
your
loneliness
for
you
may
have
an
affection
even
for
your
wretchedness
my
child
marianela
did
not
however
say
to
anything
and
as
none
of
the
family
were
indoors
at
that
hour
she
did
not
wait
for
them
florentina
went
out
leading
by
the
hand
the
poor
little
girl
whom
her
noble
impulses
and
christian
feeling
had
adopted
to
be
her
equal
and
nela
allowed
herself
to
be
led
from
sheer
incapacity
to
offer
any
resistance
she
felt
as
though
some
superhuman
power
had
taken
her
in
hand
and
was
carrying
her
along
fatally
and
inevitably
as
the
angels
bear
a
soul
away
to
heaven
they
took
the
path
by
hinojales
where
the
vagabond
child
had
seen
florentina
for
the
first
time
as
they
turned
into
the
lane
the
young
lady
said
to
her
companion
why
have
you
not
been
to
the
house
my
uncle
says
that
you
have
so
much
natural
modesty
and
delicacy
that
it
is
a
pity
you
should
not
have
been
educated
was
it
delicacy
that
kept
you
from
coming
to
ask
for
what
by
god
mercy
you
had
so
happily
gained
without
doubt
my
uncle
is
right
you
should
have
seen
the
poor
dear
man
that
day
he
said
he
should
not
be
sorry
to
die
do
you
see
my
eyes
are
still
red
with
crying
so
much
and
last
night
my
uncle
and
my
father
and
i
never
went
to
sleep
we
were
making
plans
for
all
the
family
and
building
castles
in
the
air
all
night
why
do
you
say
nothing
why
are
you
so
silent
are
you
not
as
glad
as
i
am
nela
looked
up
in
the
girl
bright
face
and
made
a
faint
effort
to
resist
the
gentle
hand
that
held
hers
come
along
what
is
the
matter
you
look
at
me
so
strangely
nela
she
did
indeed
the
hapless
child
eyes
wandering
vaguely
from
one
object
to
another
ended
by
fixing
themselves
on
the
virgin
of
her
fancy
with
a
strange
glitter
of
apprehension
why
does
your
hand
tremble
so
florentina
went
on
are
you
ill
you
are
as
pale
as
death
and
your
teeth
are
chattering
if
you
are
ill
i
will
cure
you
i
myself
can
cure
you
from
this
day
you
will
have
some
one
to
care
for
you
and
pet
you
and
make
much
of
you
and
i
shall
not
be
alone
you
know
for
pablo
is
very
fond
of
you
he
told
me
so
we
both
love
you
dearly
and
he
and
i
shall
be
like
one
he
wants
to
see
you
just
fancy
how
full
of
curiosity
a
man
must
be
who
has
never
seen
anything
at
all
but
you
can
not
think
how
from
being
so
clever
as
he
is
and
having
an
imagination
which
seems
to
have
given
him
a
number
of
ideas
which
blind
people
scarcely
ever
have
from
the
first
moment
he
knew
what
was
pretty
and
what
was
ugly
a
bit
of
scarlet
pleased
him
at
once
and
a
piece
of
coal
he
thought
hideous
he
admired
the
beauty
of
the
sky
and
was
disgusted
at
the
sight
of
a
frog
everything
that
is
beautiful
excites
him
to
an
enthusiasm
that
is
almost
delirium
everything
ugly
fills
him
with
horror
and
makes
him
tremble
as
we
do
when
we
are
frightened
my
appearance
must
have
pleased
him
for
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
oh
cousin
how
pretty
you
are
thank
god
for
having
bestowed
sight
on
me
so
that
i
can
see
you
nela
had
gently
withdrawn
her
hand
from
florentina
grasp
and
fell
on
the
ground
as
if
suddenly
stricken
to
death
the
young
girl
bent
over
her
saying
in
coaxing
tones
oh
what
is
it
ails
you
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
marianela
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
holy
virgin
face
with
a
miserable
stare
still
their
expression
was
not
one
of
aversion
but
rather
a
gaze
of
agonized
entreaty
like
the
last
look
of
a
dying
man
imploring
mercy
from
the
image
of
the
saviour
and
believing
it
to
be
god
himself
se침ora
murmured
the
child
i
do
not
hate
you
no
indeed
i
do
not
hate
you
on
the
contrary
i
love
you
dearly
i
adore
you
and
taking
up
the
hem
of
florentina
dress
she
pressed
it
to
her
dry
lips
and
kissed
it
fervently
but
whoever
supposed
you
would
hate
me
said
the
young
girl
greatly
bewildered
i
know
that
you
love
me
but
you
frighten
me
get
up
i
do
love
you
dearly
dearly
i
adore
you
repeated
nela
kissing
the
feet
of
her
benefactress
and
yet
i
can
not
i
can
not
what
can
not
you
do
for
god
sake
get
up
florentina
put
out
her
arms
to
help
her
up
but
nela
rose
without
any
assistance
and
springing
away
to
a
safe
distance
she
repeated
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
i
can
not
se침orita
i
can
not
what
in
heaven
name
what
has
come
over
you
i
can
not
go
there
and
she
pointed
to
aldeacorba
where
the
roof
of
don
francisco
house
was
visible
among
the
trees
and
why
the
blessed
virgin
knows
replied
the
child
with
prompt
decision
may
the
holy
virgin
bless
you
she
made
a
cross
with
her
fingers
and
kissed
it
she
was
registering
a
vow
florentina
took
a
step
towards
her
and
mar칤a
understanding
the
loving
impulse
flew
to
meet
her
she
laid
her
head
against
her
bosom
and
murmured
as
she
sobbed
kiss
me
for
god
sake
give
me
one
kiss
florentina
kissed
her
tenderly
and
then
freeing
herself
with
a
start
or
rather
a
wild
and
sudden
leap
the
child
or
woman
fled
to
a
brake
close
at
hand
the
brushwood
seemed
to
open
and
swallow
her
up
nela
nela
little
sister
cried
florentina
in
much
distress
farewell
child
of
my
eyes
said
nela
turning
round
to
look
at
her
once
more
and
she
vanished
in
the
copse
florentina
listened
to
the
rustle
of
the
branches
as
the
hunter
listens
to
the
rush
of
the
prey
that
has
escaped
him
then
all
was
silent
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
vague
monotone
that
fills
the
atmosphere
at
noon
in
the
open
country
a
sound
which
seems
to
be
the
whisper
of
our
own
thoughts
as
they
go
forth
towards
all
that
surrounds
us
florentina
stood
amazed
powerless
speechless
deeply
distressed
as
if
she
had
just
seen
some
fond
illusion
snatched
from
her
gaze
she
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
all
and
even
her
unbounded
which
often
crippled
her
judgment
could
supply
no
explanation
she
had
been
standing
in
the
same
spot
for
some
little
time
her
head
drooping
her
cheeks
tingling
and
her
blue
eyes
full
of
tears
when
teodoro
golfin
happened
to
come
upon
her
making
his
way
at
an
easy
pace
from
aldeacorba
homewards
the
doctor
was
greatly
astonished
to
find
the
young
lady
alone
and
with
an
expression
of
vexation
and
regret
which
far
from
diminishing
her
beauty
added
to
it
and
made
it
more
interesting
what
ails
the
girl
he
exclaimed
with
some
anxiety
why
florentina
what
is
the
matter
a
dreadful
thing
se침or
golfin
said
florentina
wiping
her
eyes
i
was
thinking
considering
how
many
terrible
things
there
are
in
the
world
and
what
are
these
terrible
things
se침orita
where
have
you
been
can
anything
have
happened
to
you
provoking
things
and
of
all
things
there
is
one
which
is
more
provoking
than
all
the
rest
what
is
that
ingratitude
se침or
and
pointing
to
the
copse
of
bramble
and
fern
she
added
it
was
in
that
direction
she
went
up
to
the
highest
spot
at
hand
to
see
farther
into
the
distance
quite
out
of
sight
she
said
with
a
sigh
quite
said
the
surgeon
laughing
don
manuel
told
me
that
you
were
devoting
yourself
to
collecting
butterflies
they
are
ungrateful
creatures
indeed
not
to
wish
to
be
caught
by
you
it
is
not
that
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
if
you
are
going
to
aldeacorba
i
was
not
going
as
i
have
just
come
away
fair
damsel
but
if
you
will
tell
me
all
about
it
be
it
what
it
may
i
will
go
back
again
i
am
all
ears
for
your
story
chapter
xviii
nela
decides
that
she
must
go
nela
wandered
about
alone
all
day
and
at
night
she
prowled
round
the
house
at
aldeacorba
creeping
as
near
to
it
as
she
dared
without
running
the
risk
of
being
discovered
whenever
she
heard
footsteps
she
stole
away
like
a
thief
then
she
went
down
into
the
crater
of
la
terrible
whose
grewsome
aspect
somehow
suited
her
gloomy
mood
she
lingered
there
some
time
looking
up
at
the
stone
giants
that
stood
round
it
and
then
she
climbed
up
one
of
them
to
see
the
lights
of
aldeacorba
there
they
were
sparkling
above
the
slopes
of
the
mine
against
the
dark
background
of
earth
and
sky
after
gazing
at
them
for
a
while
as
if
her
hungry
eyes
had
never
seen
lights
before
she
quitted
la
terrible
and
went
towards
la
trascava
but
before
she
reached
it
she
heard
footsteps
and
turning
round
she
saw
master
celipin
coming
along
the
path
at
a
brisk
determined
pace
he
had
a
small
bundle
hanging
from
a
stick
over
his
shoulder
and
his
step
as
well
as
his
air
and
attitude
announced
a
full
determination
never
to
stop
till
he
should
have
paced
the
whole
circumference
of
the
globe
celipe
where
are
you
going
cried
nela
detaining
him
nela
you
out
here
we
thought
you
were
with
se침orita
florentina
eating
ham
and
turkey
and
partridges
all
day
long
and
drinking
lemonade
and
syrups
what
are
you
doing
here
and
you
where
are
you
off
to
you
ask
me
that
now
why
do
you
ask
me
since
you
know
quite
well
answered
the
boy
jerking
the
stick
and
bundle
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
going
to
learn
all
i
can
and
make
money
did
i
not
tell
you
it
would
be
and
here
i
am
as
glad
as
can
be
a
little
sorry
too
when
i
think
that
father
and
mother
will
cry
you
see
nela
the
blessed
virgin
favored
us
for
father
and
mother
began
to
snore
sooner
than
usual
and
i
had
my
bundle
ready
and
i
climbed
up
to
the
window
and
got
out
of
now
are
you
coming
or
not
yes
i
am
coming
said
nela
with
sudden
decision
taking
the
arm
of
the
adventurous
celipin
we
will
take
the
train
and
we
will
go
in
the
train
as
far
as
we
can
said
celipin
with
liberal
enthusiasm
and
then
we
must
beg
till
we
get
to
madrid
where
the
king
of
spain
lives
and
when
once
we
have
got
there
you
can
go
as
a
servant
in
the
house
of
some
marquis
or
count
and
i
will
go
into
another
and
at
the
same
time
i
can
study
and
you
can
have
a
heap
of
fine
things
and
i
can
teach
you
a
little
of
all
i
learn
only
a
little
not
too
much
for
you
women
have
no
need
to
be
as
learned
as
we
doctors
must
be
before
celipin
had
ended
his
speech
they
had
set
out
on
their
road
trotting
on
as
fast
as
though
they
already
saw
in
the
distance
the
turrets
of
the
city
where
the
king
of
spain
lives
let
us
get
out
of
the
regular
path
said
celipin
his
practical
talents
rising
to
the
occasion
if
they
see
us
they
will
lay
hands
upon
us
and
give
us
a
good
thrashing
but
nela
drew
her
hand
away
from
her
and
sitting
down
on
a
stone
she
said
i
am
not
going
nela
what
a
little
fool
you
are
you
have
not
a
brave
heart
like
mine
a
heart
as
big
as
the
rocks
in
la
terrible
said
celipin
with
a
braggart
air
what
the
devil
are
you
afraid
of
why
will
you
not
come
i
oh
why
should
i
do
not
you
know
that
don
golfin
said
that
the
work
here
is
turning
us
all
to
stones
i
do
not
want
to
be
a
stone
not
i
i
why
should
i
go
repeated
nela
with
disconsolate
bitterness
you
have
time
enough
for
me
it
is
too
late
and
nela
head
sunk
on
her
breast
and
she
sat
for
some
time
insensible
to
the
persuasive
eloquence
of
the
hippocrates
of
the
future
the
idea
that
she
was
about
to
cross
the
boundary
of
the
spot
of
earth
where
she
had
lived
so
long
and
where
her
mother
slept
the
sleep
of
the
dead
made
her
feel
as
if
she
were
being
torn
up
by
the
roots
the
beauty
of
the
place
in
all
its
variety
seemed
to
claim
her
by
a
sort
of
relationship
the
rare
and
fleeting
joys
nay
the
very
misery
she
had
known
there
the
memory
of
her
friend
and
of
the
happy
hours
when
they
had
walked
in
the
woods
or
sat
by
the
spring
at
saldeoro
all
the
feelings
of
admiration
or
of
sympathy
of
love
or
of
gratitude
which
had
grown
and
blossomed
in
her
soul
among
these
scenes
these
flowers
these
clouds
these
rustling
trees
these
frowning
rocks
inseparable
as
it
were
from
the
loveliness
or
the
grandeur
the
progress
and
the
immutability
of
all
these
works
of
nature
were
so
many
roots
from
her
heart
and
dragging
them
up
from
the
soil
was
bitter
anguish
no
i
am
not
going
she
repeated
and
celipin
argued
and
talked
as
if
having
by
some
miracle
reached
the
goal
of
his
career
he
belonged
to
all
the
academies
present
and
to
come
you
are
going
home
then
he
asked
seeing
that
his
oratory
was
as
unavailing
as
that
of
the
academies
themselves
commonly
is
no
you
are
going
to
aldeacorba
no
not
there
either
then
you
will
go
to
where
se침ora
florentina
lives
no
no
not
there
the
devil
in
it
but
where
are
you
going
then
nela
did
not
answer
she
sat
looking
at
the
ground
with
an
expression
of
dismay
as
if
she
saw
there
the
fragments
of
the
most
beautiful
and
precious
thing
on
earth
fallen
and
lying
broken
at
her
feet
well
then
nela
said
celipin
exhausted
with
his
long
harangue
i
must
leave
you
and
be
off
for
they
might
follow
me
and
find
me
would
you
like
me
to
give
you
a
as
a
parting
gift
no
celipin
i
want
go
you
will
be
a
rich
man
yet
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
not
forget
socartes
and
your
father
and
mother
the
traveller
had
a
sensation
highly
improper
in
a
man
of
so
much
importance
and
dignity
a
strong
disposition
to
cry
but
swallowing
down
this
inopportune
emotion
he
said
how
should
i
ever
forget
socartes
you
need
not
have
said
that
i
shall
never
forget
my
father
and
mother
nor
you
for
you
helped
me
to
do
nelilla
hark
i
hear
footsteps
celipin
shouldered
his
staff
with
a
resolution
that
symbolized
his
courage
to
defy
all
the
dangers
of
the
wide
world
but
his
valorous
display
was
wasted
for
a
dog
only
came
running
up
to
them
it
is
choto
said
nela
trembling
all
over
a
bad
sign
muttered
celipin
setting
forward
and
he
disappeared
in
the
darkness
a
stone
was
lost
to
geology
and
the
world
would
be
the
richer
by
a
great
man
nela
shivered
as
the
dog
leaped
upon
her
and
caressed
her
the
affectionate
creature
after
jumping
round
and
round
her
whining
and
barking
with
so
much
expression
that
it
was
almost
like
speaking
set
off
running
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
aldeacorba
you
might
have
thought
he
was
in
chase
of
some
wild
game
choto
unlike
some
orators
seemed
to
speak
when
he
barked
just
at
this
time
teodoro
golfin
was
coming
away
from
the
pen치guilas
he
was
met
by
choto
who
with
voluble
haste
told
him
i
know
not
what
it
was
a
fervent
fitful
address
delivered
between
his
gasps
for
breath
and
gushes
of
eager
anxiety
golfin
though
he
understood
several
languages
was
not
strong
in
the
canine
tongue
and
paid
no
particular
heed
choto
leaped
up
and
round
him
jerking
out
barks
from
his
moist
jaws
some
short
and
sharp
as
insults
others
soft
and
coaxing
and
then
again
threats
teodoro
meanwhile
stood
still
his
attention
was
struck
by
the
dog
manner
and
choto
seeing
that
he
had
made
himself
understood
to
a
certain
extent
began
to
run
in
a
contrary
direction
to
golfin
homeward
road
the
doctor
followed
him
very
well
he
muttered
that
way
then
choto
retraced
his
steps
as
if
to
make
sure
that
golfin
was
following
him
and
then
he
trotted
on
again
at
some
little
distance
from
the
house
golfin
heard
a
voice
saying
well
choto
what
is
it
you
want
he
suspected
at
once
that
it
was
nela
he
paused
and
listened
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
a
and
soon
perceived
a
little
figure
standing
out
from
the
stone
wall
and
walking
very
slowly
the
shadows
of
the
brambles
prevented
his
seeing
her
very
distinctly
he
set
out
to
follow
her
at
some
little
distance
quitting
the
path
and
walking
on
the
turf
so
as
to
make
no
noise
beyond
a
doubt
it
was
nela
he
recognized
her
perfectly
when
they
got
upon
open
ground
where
there
were
no
dark
shadows
cast
by
trees
or
shrubs
the
girl
now
went
faster
and
faster
at
last
she
began
to
run
and
golfin
ran
too
after
this
unequal
race
had
gone
on
for
some
distance
nela
sat
down
on
a
stone
at
her
feet
was
the
sloping
basin
of
la
trascava
black
and
hideous
in
the
gloom
golfin
waited
a
moment
then
he
very
softly
went
nearer
to
the
girl
choto
was
seated
in
front
of
her
squatted
on
his
hind
quarters
with
his
fore
paw
stretched
out
and
gazing
at
her
with
the
gravity
of
a
sphinx
nela
stared
into
the
depths
below
and
suddenly
starting
to
her
feet
she
began
to
go
quickly
down
the
slope
slipping
rather
than
running
with
one
bound
teodoro
stood
by
the
abyss
roaring
in
stentorian
tones
nela
nela
he
looked
down
but
could
see
nothing
in
the
dark
chasm
he
could
hear
choto
whining
as
he
ran
round
and
round
the
ridge
lower
and
lower
in
spirals
as
if
he
were
being
sucked
in
by
some
eddy
in
the
dreadful
gulf
teodoro
thought
of
going
down
himself
and
cautiously
took
a
step
or
two
then
he
called
again
and
a
voice
from
below
answered
se침or
come
up
this
minute
no
answer
come
up
i
say
presently
he
could
just
see
the
child
face
in
the
lowest
visible
depths
of
the
horrible
chasm
choto
after
snuffing
at
the
opening
came
up
again
round
and
round
the
basin
as
before
nela
too
was
climbing
up
but
very
slowly
indeed
she
stopped
and
repeated
feebly
se침or
i
tell
you
come
up
what
are
you
doing
here
nela
came
a
little
further
come
quickly
i
have
something
to
tell
you
to
tell
me
yes
something
i
must
tell
you
at
once
nela
crawled
up
but
teodoro
did
not
feel
sure
that
he
had
triumphed
till
he
had
seized
her
hand
and
held
it
tightly
to
lead
her
away
with
him

walked

distance

speaking
teodoro
golfin
for
all
his
learning
wisdom
and
eloquence
felt
as
ignorant
and
as
helpless
as
nela
and
less
disposed
for
speech
than
usual
she
followed
him
unresistingly
and
he
accommodated
his
steps
to
those
of
the
like
a
man
taking
a
boy
to
school
at
a
turn
in
the
road
where
three
enormous
white
stones
stood
up
till
they
looked
like
bleached
skeletons
the
doctor
sat
down
and
placing
nela
in
front
of
him
as
if
she
were
on
her
trial
for
some
grave
delinquency
he
held
her
by
both
hands
and
said
solemnly
what
were
you
going
to
do
there
i
where
down
there
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
answer
me
plainly
as
you
would
answer
your
confessor
or
your
father
i
have
no
father
replied
nela
with
a
faintly
mutinous
accent
that
is
true
but
suppose
me
to
be
your
father
and
answer
me
what
were
you
going
to
do
my
mother
is
down
there
she
answered
dully
your
mother
is
dead
do
you
not
know
that
dead
people
are
gone
to
another
world
or
altogether
away
she
is
there
said
nela
positively
and
looking
back
towards
the
spot
she
had
left
and
you
thought
you
would
go
to
her
is
that
it
that
is
to
say
you
meant
to
kill
yourself
yes
se침or
that
is
it
and
do
you
not
know
that
your
mother
committed
a
great
sin
in
killing
herself
and
you
would
do
the
same
if
you
followed
her
example
were
you
never
taught
that
i
do
not
think
anyone
ever
told
me
anything
of
the
kind
and
if
i
want
to
kill
myself
who
is
to
prevent
me
but
you
yourself
without
being
told
can
not
you
feel
that
god
can
not
be
pleased
with
us
for
getting
rid
of
our
lives
poor
child
left
to
your
own
instincts
without
any
teaching
or
religion
or
loving
and
disinterested
guidance
what
ideas
can
you
have
of
god
of
a
future
life
of
death
what
makes
you
fancy
your
mother
is
there
do
you
call
a
few
lifeless
bones
your
mother
can
you
believe
that
she
is
still
alive
thinking
of
you
and
loving
you
down
in
that
pit
did
no
one
ever
tell
you
that
when
once
our
souls
have
left
our
bodies
they
never
return
to
them
again
do
you
not
know
that
a
tomb
a
grave
whatever
it
may
be
never
contains
anything
but
dust
and
foul
corruption
what
do
you
think
god
is
like
like
some
grand
and
solemn
man
who
sits
above
us
with
his
arms
folded
and
who
allows
us
to
play
with
our
lives
while
in
his
place
we
see
some
sprite
hobgoblin
or
fetich
of
our
fancy
your
master
nela
who
is
so
wise
and
good
did
he
never
talk
to
you
about
such
things
oh
yes
he
but
it
is
of
no
use
to
tell
me
them
now
of
no
use
now
when
you
want
to
kill
yourself
tell
me
silly
child
did
you
think
that
by
throwing
yourself
into
that
hole
you
would
be
any
better
off
yes
se침or
in
what
way
i
should
feel
none
of
the
things
i
feel
now
but
something
else
much
better
and
i
should
be
with
my
mother
i
see
you
are
more
silly
than
wicked
said
golfin
laughing
now
be
quite
honest
with
me
do
you
owe
me
any
grudge
no
indeed
i
owe
no
one
any
grudge
least
of
all
you
se침or
who
have
been
so
kind
to
me
and
have
made
my
master
see
very
good
but
that
is
not
all
i
not
only
want
you
to
like
me
but
you
must
trust
me
and
tell
me
all
your
little
secrets
strange
little
secrets
are
hidden
in
your
mind
little
woman
and
you
must
tell
them
all
to
me
every
one
you
will
see
i
shall
not
be
hard
upon
you
i
shall
make
a
very
kind
father
confessor
nela
smiled
a
forlorn
smile
then
bending
her
head
she
fell
on
her
knees
no
silly
child
that
is
not
the
way
sit
down
by
me
come
here
said
golfin
gently
drawing
her
to
a
seat
by
his
side
i
fancy
you
were
going
crazy
for
want
of
some
one
to
whom
you
could
tell
everything
is
it
not
so
and
you
are
to
conceal
nothing
you
are
indeed
alone
in
the
world
poor
come
nela
let
us
see
tell
me
first
of
all
why
now
be
very
attentive
why
you
took
it
into
your
head
that
you
wanted
to
kill
yourself
nela
did
not
answer
i
saw
you
happy
enough
and
content
with
life
to
all
appearance
only
a
few
days
since
why
have
you
suddenly
gone
mad
in
a
single
night
i
want
to
go
to
my
mother
replied
nela
after
hesitating
a
moment
i
do
not
want
to
live
any
longer
of
what
good
am
i
in
the
world
is
it
not
much
better
that
i
should
die
and
if
god
will
not
make
me
die
i
will
kill
myself
my
own
way
this
notion
that
you
are
of
no
use
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
your
miseries
poor
little
creature
curses
on
him
or
on
them
for
they
are
many
who
ever
put
it
into
your
head
they
are
all
equally
responsible
for
the
neglect
the
isolation
and
the
ignorance
in
which
you
lived
you
are
of
no
use
god
knows
what
you
might
have
been
if
you
had
fallen
into
other
hands
a
refined
nature
is
yours
perhaps
an
exquisitely
superior
but
good
heavens
if
you
put
a
harp
into
clumsy
hands
what
can
they
do
with
it
but
break
because
your
fragile
frame
is
not
strong
enough
to
break
stones
and
carry
earth
like
those
brutes
in
human
form
mariuca
and
pepina
who
shall
say
that
you
are
of
no
use
were
we
all
born
to
toil
like
mere
animals
are
you
to
be
forbidden
to
have
any
intelligence
any
feeling
any
of
the
gifts
of
nature
which
no
one
has
ever
cultivated
in
you
nonsense
you
are
of
some
use
you
might
be
of
great
good
if
you
only
fell
into
hands
that
could
mould
you
and
train
you
nela
whose
intuition
gathered
the
purport
of
this
speech
though
the
words
were
beyond
her
was
deeply
impressed
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
teodoro
golfin
rugged
shrewd
and
expressive
countenance
her
heart
was
full
of
astonishment
and
gratitude
still
there
is
a
mystery
about
you
the
dusky
leonine
doctor
went
on
the
most
perfect
opportunity
was
offered
you
to
escape
from
your
miserable
lot
and
you
refused
it
florentina
who
is
an
angel
if
ever
there
was
one
was
ready
to
adopt
you
as
a
friend
and
a
sister
i
never
knew
an
instance
of
greater
kindness
and
and
what
have
you
done
fled
from
her
like
a
wild
this
is
sheer
ingratitude
or
some
other
feeling
which
i
can
not
at
all
comprehend
no
no
no
cried
nela
much
distressed
i
am
not
ungrateful
i
adore
se침orita
florentina
she
seems
to
me
not
to
be
made
of
flesh
and
blood
like
the
rest
of
us
i
do
not
deserve
even
to
look
upon
her
well
my
child
you
may
mean
what
you
say
but
from
your
behavior
we
can
only
conclude
that
you
are
ungrateful
most
ungrateful
no
no
sobbed
nela
i
am
not
indeed
i
am
not
ungrateful
i
was
afraid
i
knew
that
you
would
all
think
me
ungrateful
and
that
was
the
only
thing
that
troubled
me
when
i
was
going
to
kill
but
i
am
so
stupid
i
did
not
know
how
to
ask
pardon
of
the
se침orita
before
i
ran
away
nor
how
to
explain
it
all
i
will
make
your
peace
with
florentina
and
even
if
you
wish
never
to
see
her
again
i
will
undertake
to
tell
her
and
convince
her
that
you
were
not
ungrateful
now
open
your
heart
to
me
and
tell
me
everything
what
makes
you
so
miserable
and
desperate
however
wretched
a
human
being
may
be
however
great
his
misery
and
loneliness
he
does
not
take
his
own
life
unless
he
has
some
overpowering
reason
for
hating
it
no
se침or
so
it
seems
to
me
then
you
hate
your
life
nela
was
silent
for
a
minute
then
crossing
her
arms
she
exclaimed
vehemently
no
no
i
do
not
hate
it
on
the
contrary
i
want
to
find
it
a
pretty
way
you
were
going
to
work
to
look
for
it
i
thought
that
when
you
were
dead
you
would
have
everything
you
could
not
get
here
if
not
why
is
death
always
always
calling
us
to
come
i
have
dreams
and
when
i
dream
i
see
all
who
are
dead
happy
and
at
peace
you
believe
in
dreams
yes
i
look
at
the
trees
and
the
rocks
that
i
have
seen
here
ever
since
i
was
born
and
in
their
face
come
come
the
trees
and
rocks
have
faces
yes
everything
that
is
lovely
can
see
and
and
they
say
to
me
to
us
die
and
you
will
live
quite
happy
what
a
lamentable
fancy
golfin
muttered
to
himself
a
perfectly
pagan
spirit
and
he
added
aloud
but
if
you
want
to
live
why
did
you
not
accept
florentina
offer
i
come
back
to
the
same
question
because
because
what
the
se침orita
offered
me
was
worse
than
death
cried
nela
vehemently
how
unjustly
you
think
of
her
kind
charity
there
are
of
course
beings
so
wretched
that
they
prefer
a
low
and
vagabond
existence
to
the
dignity
of
a
superior
position
you
are
accustomed
to
a
free
life
in
direct
contact
with
nature
and
you
prefer
this
debased
freedom
to
the
sweet
affections
of
home
life
have
you
been
so
happy
then
in
this
mode
of
life
i
was
beginning
to
be
happy
and
when
did
you
cease
to
be
happy
after
a
long
pause
nela
replied
when
you
came
here
i
what
harm
have
i
done
you
none
none
nothing
but
the
greatest
good
i
have
given
your
master
his
sight
said
golfin
looking
at
face
with
the
narrow
attention
of
a
physiologist
do
you
not
thank
me
for
that
much
se침or
very
much
and
she
gazed
up
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
tears
golfin
watched
her
closely
so
as
not
to
miss
the
slightest
change
of
expression
which
might
guide
him
to
a
comprehension
of
the
feelings
as
he
went
on
your
master
told
me
that
he
loved
you
dearly
when
he
was
blind
and
now
that
he
can
see
he
constantly
asks
for
nela
he
knows
very
well
that
for
him
the
whole
outer
world
was
filled
by
one
person
nela
and
the
sight
which
has
been
mercifully
bestowed
on
him
is
of
no
value
to
him
unless
he
can
use
it
to
see
nela
to
see
nela
but
he
never
shall
see
nela
nela
will
never
let
him
see
her
she
exclaimed
excitedly
why
not
because
she
is
so
he
may
have
cared
for
mar칤a
canela
when
his
eyes
were
shut
but
now
that
they
are
open
and
he
can
see
the
se침orita
he
can
never
never
care
for
a
poor
little
dwarf
who
knows
but
it
is
impossible
she
said
positively
it
is
your
fancy
you
can
not
tell
whether
your
master
will
be
pleased
with
you
or
not
till
you
try
i
will
take
you
to
the
house
i
will
not
go
i
can
not
go
she
cried
starting
to
her
feet
and
standing
in
front
of
teodoro
who
was
utterly
astounded
at
the
determination
of
her
gesture
and
the
flash
of
her
black
eyes
which
both
revealed
her
resolute
nature
be
calm
be
easy
come
here
he
said
persuasively
it
is
true
that
you
are
not
very
pretty
but
a
sensible
man
does
not
think
so
much
as
you
fancy
of
mere
outside
beauty
you
are
too
little
woman
but
nela
paying
no
sort
of
heed
to
the
doctor
moralities
and
as
resolute
in
her
attitude
as
she
was
in
her
opinion
gravely
went
on
as
if
pronouncing
sentence
there
ought
to
be
nothing
ugly
in
the
nothing
that
is
ugly
ought
to
be
allowed
to
live
but
my
child
if
all
we
ugly
people
were
to
be
obliged
to
take
ourselves
out
of
the
world
it
would
be
left
almost
depopulated
poor
unhappy
little
simpleton
but
this
notion
of
yours
is
not
a
new
one
other
persons
had
it
before
you
centuries
ago
persons
with
an
imagination
like
yours
living
as
you
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
nature
and
lacking
the
light
which
your
ignorance
and
loneliness
have
deprived
you
of
and
which
they
had
not
because
it
had
not
then
dawned
on
the
but
you
must
be
cured
of
this
delusion
you
must
reflect
that
you
have
your
portion
of
gifts
more
precious
than
beauty
gifts
of
the
mind
which
neither
fade
with
time
nor
change
with
the
caprices
of
taste
seek
for
them
in
your
soul
and
you
will
find
them
they
will
not
perish
as
beauty
would
which
seek
it
as
you
may
in
your
you
will
never
find
but
seek
out
these
really
good
and
precious
gifts
cultivate
them
and
when
you
see
them
thriving
and
blooming
all
this
misery
you
are
suffering
will
vanish
take
my
word
for
it
and
meanwhile
you
will
soon
rise
superior
to
the
wretched
situation
in
which
you
now
are
and
acquire
a
beauty
which
may
not
perhaps
charm
the
eye
but
which
will
be
a
source
of
pride
and
happiness
to
yourself
this
wise
advice
was
either
not
heard
or
not
heeded
by
nela
she
sat
down
again
by
golfin
and
gazed
fixedly
in
his
face
her
small
eyes
more
eloquent
just
then
than
the
finest
could
have
been
seemed
to
say
and
what
is
the
upshot
of
all
these
fine
speeches
learned
sir
now
you
see
golfin
went
on
warming
to
his
subject
and
giving
it
in
spite
of
himself
the
character
of
a
psychological
lecture
there
is
one
important
question
and
that
is
but
nela
had
guessed
it
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
there
is
nothing
strange
in
it
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
most
natural
thing
that
could
happen
to
you
you
have
a
sensitive
temperament
and
an
excitable
imagination
you
and
your
master
had
led
a
life
together
of
free
and
poetic
communion
with
nature
and
of
most
perfect
and
innocent
intimacy
he
is
as
wise
and
clever
as
a
man
can
be
and
as
handsome
as
a
statue
his
beauty
when
blind
even
seemed
formed
to
delight
the
eyes
of
those
who
could
see
his
kindness
of
heart
too
and
generous
spirit
are
enough
to
charm
and
win
the
love
of
any
woman
it
is
not
strange
that
they
should
have
captivated
you
a
child
so
womanly
or
a
woman
looking
so
like
a
do
you
love
him
so
much
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
yes
yes
se침or
the
girl
sobbed
out
and
you
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
his
ceasing
to
love
you
no
se침or
and
he
used
to
say
loving
words
to
you
and
make
you
promises
yes
oh
yes
se침or
he
told
me
i
should
be
his
companion
as
long
as
he
lived
and
and
i
believed
him
and
why
should
you
not
he
said
he
could
not
live
without
me
and
that
even
if
he
ever
could
see
he
would
still
love
me
i
was
quite
happy
i
was
ugly
and
little
and
but
i
did
not
care
for
he
could
not
see
me
and
in
his
darkness
he
thought
i
was
and
then
then
said
golfin
gently
for
he
was
filled
with
pity
i
see
the
fault
is
all
mine
fault
no
for
you
did
a
good
deed
you
are
very
very
good
it
is
good
to
have
given
him
his
sight
i
know
i
tell
myself
that
it
is
good
but
after
that
i
must
go
away
quite
away
for
he
will
see
se침orita
florentina
and
will
compare
me
with
her
and
se침orita
florentina
is
as
pretty
as
the
angels
and
i
it
is
like
comparing
a
piece
of
broken
glass
with
the
sun
of
what
good
can
i
be
i
dreamed
that
i
ought
never
to
have
been
born
oh
why
was
i
ever
born
god
made
a
mistake
he
gave
me
an
ugly
face
and
a
miserable
little
body
and
such
a
large
heart
but
of
what
use
to
me
is
a
large
heart
it
is
a
torment
and
nothing
else
woe
is
me
if
i
did
not
keep
it
under
it
would
hate
and
detest
a
great
many
people
and
yet
i
do
not
want
to
hate
people
i
do
not
know
how
to
hate
them
and
i
would
rather
bury
my
miserable
heart
than
live
to
learn
to
hate
bury
it
so
that
it
should
not
torment
me
any
more
you
are
tormented
by
jealousy
and
by
your
sense
of
humiliation
poor
little
one
you
are
indeed
alone
neither
the
knowledge
you
lack
nor
the
home
you
have
never
had
nor
the
work
you
can
not
do
would
avail
to
save
you
from
this
but
tell
me
what
do
you
feel
about
the
protection
and
kindness
that
florentina
offers
you
terror
shame
exclaimed
nela
opening
her
eyes
wide
in
horror
to
live
with
them
to
see
them
constantly
for
they
will
marry
my
heart
tells
me
they
will
marry
i
dreamed
it
i
know
it
but
florentina
is
very
kind
she
will
love
you
dearly
yes
and
i
love
her
but
not
at
aldeacorba
cried
the
girl
in
wild
accents
she
came
to
rob
me
of
what
was
mine
for
he
was
mine
yes
se침or
he
was
indeed
florentina
is
like
the
blessed
virgin
i
will
pray
to
her
yes
se침or
and
worship
her
but
i
do
not
want
her
to
take
away
what
is
my
own
and
she
will
take
it
away
she
has
taken
it
away
already
and
where
am
i
to
go
to
what
am
i
what
good
am
i
in
the
world
at
all
i
have
lost
everything
and
i
want
to
go
to
my
mother
she
walked
away
but
golfin
seized
her
as
a
wild
beast
clutches
its
prey
and
held
her
tightly
by
the
wrist
as
he
did
so
he
felt
her
quick
and
fluttering
pulse
come
here
he
said
from
this
moment
whether
you
like
it
or
no
you
are
my
slave
you
are
mine
and
you
are
to
do
nothing
but
what
i
tell
you
poor
little
soul
full
of
eager
feeling
of
fervent
fancy
frankness
and
superstition
you
have
a
nature
framed
for
all
that
is
good
but
it
has
been
ruined
by
the
wild
life
you
have
led
by
neglect
and
want
of
training
and
even
the
most
elementary
teaching
what
a
hideous
state
of
society
we
live
in
which
forgets
its
duties
so
utterly
and
leaves
a
precious
creature
like
this
perish
come
here
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
quit
my
side
i
have
hunted
you
down
and
caught
you
caught
you
in
a
trap
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
in
some
sylvan
wilderness
and
now
i
shall
try
to
teach
you
and
train
you
we
will
see
if
this
rough
diamond
can
not
be
cut
and
polished
ah
you
do
not
even
know
how
ignorant
you
are
and
i
shall
open
a
new
world
to
your
mind
show
you
a
thousand
wonderful
things
that
you
have
never
understood
though
you
have
a
vague
and
dim
idea
of
some
of
them
tell
me
can
not
you
feel
in
your
soul
a
germ
how
shall
i
explain
myself
a
bud
of
that
rarest
and
most
beautiful
grace
humility
the
mother
of
all
the
virtues
which
strange
to
say
makes
us
actually
happy
when
we
see
ourselves
subordinate
to
others
have
you
never
felt
the
impulse
of
which
makes
us
rejoice
in
sacrificing
ourselves
for
others
in
making
ourselves
small
that
some
one
else
may
become
great
but
you
will
learn
this
child
you
will
learn
to
lay
your
ugliness
at
the
feet
of
beauty
to
look
on
with
calm
satisfaction
and
joy
at
the
triumphs
of
others
to
fetter
that
great
wild
heart
of
yours
and
bring
it
into
subjection
so
that
you
shall
never
feel
envy
nor
rage
but
will
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
and
rise
superior
to
all
who
may
have
injured
or
hurt
you
you
shall
be
made
all
that
nature
meant
you
to
be
when
she
endowed
you
at
your
birth
hapless
child
born
in
a
christian
country
and
not
even
a
christian
your
soul
dwells
in
a
sort
of
poetic
worship
of
you
can
not
understand
me
little
one
but
so
it
is
you
are
in
the
state
of
those
primitive
peoples
of
whom
the
memory
even
hardly
survives
governed
by
your
instincts
and
passions
while
beauty
is
your
dearest
idol
eighteen
centuries
have
been
devoted
in
vain
to
spiritualizing
humanity
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
and
as
to
the
selfish
world
which
has
left
you
to
such
a
fate
what
name
does
it
deserve
you
have
lived
in
these
mines
a
solitary
soul
not
taught
a
single
letter
not
even
sent
to
an
infant
school
though
you
would
have
learnt
little
enough
there
not
even
given
the
most
imperfect
teaching
in
that
religion
of
which
your
nation
boasts
why
you
have
never
been
inside
a
church
except
to
stare
at
some
ceremony
which
to
you
had
no
meaning
you
can
not
even
mutter
a
prayer
that
you
understand
you
know
nothing
of
the
world
or
of
god
or
your
own
soul
but
you
shall
know
all
this
you
shall
be
a
different
creature
you
shall
no
longer
be
hapless
little
nela
but
a
good
and
honest
and
useful
woman
it
would
be
rash
to
assert
that
nela
had
understood
all
this
speech
which
golfin
declaimed
with
such
vehemence
and
fervor
that
he
entirely
forgot
the
person
to
whom
he
was
speaking
but
the
little
outcast
felt
a
curious
fascination
and
the
spirit
of
her
friend
utterances
sank
gently
into
her
soul
and
soothed
it
and
compelled
her
to
blind
assent
his
power
over
the
untaught
girl
was
that
fateful
and
irresistible
control
which
a
superior
mind
exercises
over
an
inferior
one
sad
but
unresisting
her
head
drooped
against
the
shoulder
come
along
golfin
said
resolutely
nela
trembled
from
head
to
foot
a
cold
sweat
stood
on
her
face
and
golfin
felt
that
her
hands
were
and
her
pulses
beating
violently
but
he
failed
to
attribute
this
physical
condition
to
her
mental
anguish
he
held
her
hand
more
firmly
and
repeated
come
it
is
cold
here
his
power
over
her
was
so
great
that
she
rose
as
he
did
and
they
went
a
little
way
together
but
then
nela
stopped
and
fell
on
her
knees
oh
se침or
she
cried
in
an
agony
do
not
take
me
away
with
you
she
was
very
pale
and
looked
wrecked
by
physical
and
mental
misery
golfin
tried
to
pull
her
up
but
her
helpless
frame
did
not
stir
by
any
strength
of
her
own
it
was
clear
she
must
be
carried
like
a
senseless
corpse
one
day
said
golfin
not
very
long
since
almost
in
this
very
place
i
took
you
on
my
shoulders
to
carry
you
now
i
must
do
the
same
it
seems
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
her
hot
breath
seemed
to
burn
his
face
she
was
drooping
fading
dying
like
a
plant
torn
up
from
the
soil
and
with
its
roots
laid
bare
as
they
got
nearer
to
aldeacorba
golfin
felt
some
life
returning
to
the
dead
weight
in
his
arms
nela
raised
her
head
and
threw
up
her
hands
in
despair
but
she
said
nothing
they
went
in
all
was
silent
a
maid
servant
came
to
meet
them
and
by
teodoro
desire
she
conducted
him
noiselessly
to
florentina
room
florentina
was
alone
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
she
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
her
elbows
resting
on
the
seat
of
a
chair
and
praying
with
absorbed
devotion
she
was
startled
at
seeing
a
man
at
her
door
at
so
late
an
hour
but
her
alarm
at
once
gave
way
to
surprise
when
she
saw
the
burden
golfin
bore
in
his
strong
arms
her
astonishment
was
too
great
for
speech
when
the
doctor
carefully
depositing
his
load
on
a
sofa
said
i
have
caught
her
you
what
do
you
say
to
that
am
i
a
good

hunter
chapter
xx
a
new
world
we
must
now
go
back
a
few
days
when
teodoro
golfin
first
removed
the
bandage
for
a
few
moments
from
pablo
pen치guilas
eyes
the
boy
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
every
impulse
made
him
shrink
from
all
he
saw
he
put
out
his
hands
as
though
by
pushing
away
one
object
he
could
get
away
farther
from
the
rest
luminous
space
was
to
him
like
a
vast
void
into
which
he
felt
as
if
he
must
fall
and
the
instinct
of
made
him
close
his
eyes
to
feel
himself
safe
however
his
father
the
surgeon
and
the
rest
of
them
persuaded
him
to
try
once
more
for
all
were
equally
anxious
he
looked
again
but
his
terror
was
no
less
the
images
of
all
he
saw
rushed
into
his
brain
with
such
sudden
violence
and
confusion
with
a
sort
of
storm
and
assault
as
it
were
that
he
felt
as
if
they
were
falling
upon
him
bodily
the
distant
mountains
seemed
to
lie
within
reach
and
the
persons
and
objects
that
were
near
him
seemed
literally
to
strike
his
eyes
golfin
noted
these
phenomena
with
the
most
eager
interest
this
was
the
second
case
of
cure
of
congenital
blindness
which
he
had
had
the
opportunity
of
studying
the
others
hardly
dared
to
be
glad
they
were
so
bewildered
and
alarmed
by
the
agitating
effects
produced
on
the
patient
by
the
first
exercise
of
the
function
of
sight
to
pablo
himself
it
was
a
series
of
delightful
experiments
his
nerves
and
his
imagination
were
so
seriously
excited
the
surgeon
thought
it
prudent
to
compel
him
to
rest
now
he
said
smiling
you
have
seen
enough
for
you
can
not
step
out
of
darkness
into
light
into
the
wide
domain
of
the
sun
as
you
would
walk
into
a
theatre
this
is
a
new
birth
with
pain
as
well
as
joy
in
it
presently
the
young
fellow
was
so
eager
to
try
his
power
once
more
that
golfin
consented
to
open
a
crack
as
it
were
upon
the
outer
world
my
whole
mind
said
pablo
trying
to
explain
his
first
impressions
seems
bathed
in
beauty
a
beauty
i
had
never
dreamed
of
before
what
were
the
things
which
rushed
in
upon
me
and
filled
me
with
terror
it
was
the
sense
of
size
of
space
which
i
had
never
before
conceived
of
but
in
a
very
imperfect
manner
and
which
dawned
upon
me
clear
and
terrible
as
if
i
were
being
dragged
up
to
the
highest
mountains
and
down
to
the
deepest
abyss
it
is
all
grand
and
beautiful
but
it
makes
me
tremble
but
i
want
to
feel
it
all
once
more
all
the
glory
and
loveliness
that
i
gazed
at
has
made
me
feel
bewildered
and
humbled
it
was
like
some
serene
and
majestic
presence
bending
down
to
meet
me
the
whole
universe
seemed
to
be
rushing
towards
me
and
i
was
startled
and
terror
stricken
the
sky
looked
like
a
vast
space
watching
listening
i
can
not
put
it
into
it
was
vacancy
but
strangely
full
of
expression
all
that
landscape
of
sky
and
mountains
looked
at
me
came
down
upon
me
but
it
was
all
so
cold
and
grand
and
stern
let
me
see
something
delicate
something
gentle
and
lovable
nela
where
is
nela
golfin
once
more
relieved
him
of
the
bandage
and
giving
him
a
pair
of
suitable
spectacles
he
left
him
free
to
look
about
him
oh
is
that
nela
merciful
heaven
exclaimed
pablo
enchanted
this
is
your
cousin
florentina
ah
said
the
lad
coloring
with
confusion
that
is
my
cousin
i
had
no
idea
any
person
could
be
so
oh
thank
god
for
giving
me
the
faculty
which
enables
me
to
see
anything
so
lovely
cousin
florentina
you
are
like
the
most
lovely
music
like
the
most
perfect
embodiment
of
some
delicious
and
nela
where
is
she
you
will
have
time
enough
to
see
her
said
don
francisco
delighted
try
now
to
be
calm
florentina
florentina
repeated
pablo
excitedly
what
is
it
in
your
face
that
makes
me
feel
as
if
the
spirit
of
god
himself
was
shining
through
it
you
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
glory
which
must
to
be
sure
be
the
sun
beams
rays
seem
to
shine
from
your
ah
at
last
i
know
what
the
angels
are
like
and
your
dress
your
hands
your
hair
seem
to
fill
me
with
some
new
and
strange
sensation
what
is
it
he
is
beginning
to
see
color
muttered
golfin
to
himself
he
perhaps
perceives
every
object
surrounded
by
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
but
he
can
not
estimate
degrees
of
distance
i
seem
to
have
you
inside
my
eyes
pablo
went
on
you
seem
to
have
become
part
of
my
thoughts
and
the
sight
of
you
comes
upon
me
like
a
memory
but
a
memory
of
what
i
never
saw
any
thing
or
any
body
before
can
i
have
lived
before
i
came
into
this
world
i
know
not
but
i
knew
your
eyes
and
you
father
where
are
you
i
have
seen
you
yes
i
have
pictured
you
too
you
are
just
what
i
have
loved
and
now
my
uncle
you
are
very
much
and
where
where
is
that
dear
good
golfin
bless
him
here
minding
my
patient
said
the
surgeon
coming
forward
here
i
am
as
ugly
as
as
you
have
never
seen
a
lion
or
a
newfoundland
dog
you
can
have
no
idea
of
my
style
of
beauty
they
say
i
am
exactly
like
those
two
noble
beasts
all
good
kind
souls
said
pablo
but
my
cousin
is
the
prettiest
oh
infinitely
the
prettiest
but
nela
for
pity
sake
where
is
nela
they
told
him
that
his
never
came
to
the
house
and
that
they
had
been
too
busy
to
go
to
look
for
her
and
he
was
extremely
distressed
at
this
intelligence
they
succeeded
in
soothing
him
and
as
they
feared
he
might
become
feverish
they
persuaded
him
to
go
to
bed
and
try
to
sleep
the
next
day
he
was
in
a
state
of
great
prostration
but
his
vigorous
nature
triumphed
over
everything
he
begged
to
have
a
glass
of
water
and
when
he
saw
it
he
exclaimed
i
feel
as
i
were
drinking
at
the
mere
sight
of
water
his
expressions
were
equally
vivid
and
picturesque
about
everything
he
saw
which
struck
his
fancy
strongly
after
correcting
the
defective
sphericity
of
the
eye
by
means
of
glasses
which
he
tried
one
after
another
golfin
began
to
direct
his
attention
to
the
differences
and
combinations
of
colors
and
the
young
man
sound
mind
and
taste
never
failed
in
distinguishing
the
ugly
from
the
beautiful
indeed
he
felt
these
two
attributes
as
two
absolute
and
distinct
ideas
without
connecting
them
in
any
way
with
any
notion
of
utility
or
on
the
other
hand
of
goodness
a
butterfly
which
flew
by
accident
into
his
room
enchanted
him
but
an
he
thought
simply
horrible
though
his
father
explained
to
him
that
it
could
not
be
otherwise
since
its
use
was
to
hold
ink
to
write
with
when
he
was
shown
two
prints
one
of
the
crucifixion
and
one
of
galatea
riding
in
a
shell
and
escorted
by
tritons
and
nymphs
he
preferred
the
second
which
was
a
great
scandal
to
florentina
who
promised
herself
that
she
would
teach
him
to
hold
sacred
things
far
above
everything
profane
he
watched
their
faces
with
the
keenest
attention
and
the
wonderful
coincidence
of
facial
expression
with
language
astonished
him
excessively
when
he
saw
the
maids
and
other
women
about
the
place
he
was
greatly
annoyed
if
they
were
ugly
or
commonplace
indeed
his
cousin
beauty
made
him
indifferent
to
any
other
woman
in
spite
of
this
he
wanted
to
see
them
all
his
curiosity
was
like
a
raging
thirst
which
nothing
could
satisfy
every
day
he
was
disappointed
at
never
seeing
nela
but
he
was
so
fond
of
florentina
that
he
could
not
bear
her
to
leave
him
for
a
moment
on
the
third
day
golfin
said
to
him
you
have
now
made
acquaintance
with
a
great
many
things
the
marvels
of
this
visible
world
now
you
must
see
yourself
he
brought
a
mirror
and
pablo
looked
in
it
that
is
i
he
exclaimed
with
simple
admiration
it
is
difficult
to
believe
it
how
have
i
come
inside
that
hard
still
sheet
of
water
what
a
wonderful
thing
glass
is
it
seems
as
if
it
could
not
be
true
that
men
made
that
stony
my
word
but
i
am
not
an
ugly
fellow
what
do
you
say
cousin
and
you
when
you
look
in
this
do
you
see
yourself
as
pretty
as
you
are
no
impossible
look
up
into
the
sky
and
you
will
find
your
image
there
you
may
believe
you
see
an
angel
when
you
only
look
at
yourself
that
evening
when
he
was
alone
with
her
and
she
was
giving
him
some
little
help
he
needed
as
an
invalid
pablo
said
to
her
cousin
my
father
read
me
i
remember
a
passage
in
history
about
christopher
columbus
who
discovered
a
new
world
which
no
european
had
ever
seen
before
that
navigator
opened
the
eyes
of
the
old
world
so
that
they
saw
another
and
more
beautiful
one
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
him
as
a
man
like
teodoro
golfin
and
of
europe
as
a
blind
man
to
whom
america
and
its
wonders
were
like
a
revelation
of
light
well
and
i
have
seen
a
new
you
are
my
america
you
are
that
first
and
lovely
island
where
columbus
set
foot
on
land
he
never
saw
the
continent
with
its
vast
forests
and
immense
rivers
and
i
too
perhaps
have
not
yet
seen
what
is
loveliest
of
all
he
broke
off
and
sat
sunk
in
thought
then
presently
he
asked
where
is
nela
i
can
not
think
what
has
come
over
the
poor
child
said
florentina
i
suppose
she
does
not
wish
to
see
you
she
is
bashful
and
very
shy
replied
pablo
she
is
afraid
of
troubling
us
in
the
house
florentina
i
must
tell
you
in
confidence
that
i
love
her
dearly
you
will
love
her
too
i
have
a
most
eager
wish
to
see
my
good
little
comrade
and
friend
i
will
go
and
look
for
her
morning
myself
yes
do
but
do
not
be
gone
long
when
i
do
not
see
you
i
feel
very
lonely
i
have
become
accustomed
to
see
you
and
these
three
days
have
been
centuries
of
do
not
rob
me
of
a
minute
last
night
my
father
told
me
that
after
having
seen
you
i
ought
never
to
want
to
see
another
woman
what
nonsense
exclaimed
the
girl
blushing
there
are
plenty
much
prettier
than
i
am
no
no
they
all
say
no
pablo
vehemently
declared
turning
his
blindfold
eyes
towards
his
cousin
as
if
he
could
see
her
even
through
his
bandages
they
used
to
tell
me
so
before
and
i
could
not
believe
it
but
now
that
i
have
seen
the
world
and
know
what
beauty
is
i
believe
it
yes
indeed
i
do
you
are
perfectly
lovely
there
is
no
one
there
can
be
no
one
more
give
me
your
hand
and
he
grasped
it
eagerly
in
both
of
his
i
laugh
now
he
went
on
to
think
of
my
absurd
blind
man
vanity
of
my
foolish
attempts
to
realize
the
true
aspect
of
things
without
seeing
them
i
believe
that
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
the
surprise
that
the
reality
was
to
me
reality
oh
the
man
who
knows
it
not
is
blind
indeed
a
perfect
idiot
florentina
i
was
an
idiot
no
cousin
you
were
always
very
clever
and
so
you
are
still
but
do
not
let
your
fancy
work
too
vividly
now
it
will
soon
be
time
to
go
to
bed
don
teodoro
particularly
said
that
i
was
not
to
let
you
talk
so
late
because
it
keeps
you
from
sleeping
if
you
do
not
keep
quiet
i
shall
go
away
is
it
night
already
yes
quite
night
but
day
or
night
i
love
to
talk
to
you
pablo
persisted
tossing
over
on
his
bed
on
which
he
was
lying
dressed
and
very
restless
i
will
be
silent
on
one
condition
and
that
is
that
you
do
not
go
away
from
my
side
and
that
from
time
to
time
you
pat
the
bed
with
your
hand
that
i
may
know
that
you
are
there
very
well
so
i
will
and
this
is
the
first
sign
of
life
said
florentina
laughing
and
patting
the
mattress
when
i
hear
you
laugh
i
feel
as
if
a
breath
of
sweet
fresh
air
blew
round
me
and
all
my
senses
help
in
some
way
to
remind
me
of
you
your
image
lives
in
my
memory
so
vividly
that
even
with
my
eyes
bandaged
i
can
see
you
still
the
same
will
you
have
done
chattering
or
must
i
fetch
don
teodoro
said
the
girl
gaily
no
no
stay
quiet
i
can
not
be
silent
if
i
were
to
be
silent
all
my
thoughts
all
i
can
see
in
my
brain
would
only
torment
me
twice
as
much
and
you
want
me
to
go
to
sleep
sleep
but
i
have
you
in
here
florentina
making
a
turmoil
in
my
brain
and
driving
me
crazy
i
am
so
full
of
joy
and
rapture
that
i
have
no
words
to
express
them
all
last
night
i
fancied
i
was
talking
to
you
and
to
poor
little
nela
i
am
most
curious
to
see
desperately
curious
well
i
will
find
her
now
have
done
with
your
talking
if
you
do
not
cease
i
shall
go
no
stop
i
will
only
talk
to
myself
i
will
say
all
the
things
i
say
to
you
at
night
when
i
fancy
we
are
alone
together
i
will
remember
what
you
say
to
me
i
well
the
things
i
can
fancy
i
hear
said
in
your
voice
now
do
you
be
silent
se침orita
i
am
alone
now
with
my
own
imaginings
the
next
day
when
florentina
came
up
to
her
cousin
room
she
said
i
brought
maraquilla
up
here
and
she
ran
away
ungrateful
little
thing
and
you
did
not
look
for
her
where
was
i
to
look
she
ran
away
from
me
this
evening
i
will
go
out
again
and
hunt
her
till
i
find
her
no
no
do
not
go
out
said
pablo
eagerly
she
will
come
back
she
will
come
of
her
own
accord
she
seems
out
of
her
mind
does
she
know
that
i
can
see
now
i
myself
told
her
but
really
i
am
sure
she
has
lost
her
wits
she
says
that
i
am
the
holy
virgin
and
kisses
my
dress
that
shows
that
you
have
produced
the
same
impression
on
her
as
on
every
one
else
nela
is
so
sweet
poor
little
girl
we
must
take
care
of
her
florentina
and
be
kind
to
her
do
not
you
think
so
she
is
ungrateful
i
am
afraid
said
florentina
sadly
no
never
think
so
nela
could
not
be
ungrateful
she
is
a
good
child
i
am
very
fond
of
her
she
must
be
found
and
brought
here
to
me
i
will
go
no
not
you
said
pablo
positively
taking
his
cousin
hand
your
duty
most
undutiful
cousin
is
to
take
care
of
me
if
golfin
does
not
come
soon
to
take
off
my
bandage
and
put
on
my
glasses
i
shall
do
it
myself
i
have
not
seen
you
since
yesterday
and
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
is
don
teodoro
come
he
is
down
stairs
with
your
father
and
mine
he
will
come
up
quite
soon
have
patience
you
are
as
bad
as
a
pablo
writhed
with
irritation
light
light
he
cried
it
is
a
crime
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
so
long
i
can
not
live
like
this
i
shall
die
i
want
what
is
the
bread
of
life
to
me
i
want
the
use
of
my
eyes
i
have
not
seen
you
cousin
and
i
am
wild
to
see
you
i
am
hungry
thirsty
to
see
you
oh
thank
god
for
real
knowledge
thank
god
for
having
created
you
sweetest
of
women
a
combination
of
every
and
yet
if
after
having
created
beauty
god
had
not
given
us
hearts
to
feel
it
how
imperfect
his
work
would
have
been
light
light
teodoro
came
up
and
opened
the
gates
of
the
outer
world
to
him
filling
his
soul
with
joy
and
he
passed
a
quiet
day
talking
of
a
variety
of
subjects
not
till
the
evening
did
his
thoughts
revert
to
that
point
in
his
past
life
which
seemed
to
be
diminishing
and
fading
in
the
distance
like
vessels
which
on
a
clear
day
are
lost
on
the
horizon
it
was
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
recalls
some
long
past
circumstance
that
pablo
asked
has
not
nela
made
her
appearance
florentina
replied
that
she
had
not
and
they
talked
of
other
things
in
the
course
of
the
night
at
a
very
late
hour
pablo
heard
the
noise
of
voices
in
the
house
he
fancied
he
heard
those
of
teodoro
golfin
of
florentina
and
of
his
father
but
after
that
he
slept
quietly
though
haunted
in
his
dreams
by
the
images
of
all
he
had
seen
and
the
phantoms
of
all
he
imagined
his
dreams
which
began
tranquilly
and
smilingly
afterwards
became
agitated
and
painful
for
in
some
deep
recess
of
his
soul
as
though
it
were
a
vast
cavern
suddenly
lighted
up
rose
a
medley
array
of
the
beautiful
and
the
hideous
forms
of
the
outside
world
of
passions
awakened
and
memories
buried
convulsing
his
whole
soul
the
following
day
as
golfin
had
promised
he
left
his
room
to
move
about
the
house
chapter
xxi
eyes
that
kill
the
room
which
had
been
assigned
to
florentina
at
aldeacorba
was
the
pleasantest
in
the
house
no
one
had
used
it
since
the
death
of
mother
but
don
francisco
deeming
his
niece
worthy
to
be
lodged
there
had
the
room
neatly
arranged
and
added
some
little
elegancies
which
had
been
quite
unknown
to
it
in
his
wife
lifetime
the
balcony
looked
southwards
and
over
the
garden
so
that
the
room
was
always
flooded
with
light
and
perfume
and
cheered
by
the
happy
song
of
birds
florentina
herself
during
her
few
days
stay
had
given
it
the
stamp
so
to
speak
of
her
own
individuality
all
sorts
of
small
properties
and
trifles
betrayed
the
nature
of
the
woman
who
lived
in
it
as
you
may
know
a
bird
by
its
nest
if
there
are
some
persons
who
would
make
a
hell
of
a
palace
so
there
are
others
who
have
only
to
enter
a
hovel
to
make
it
a
paradise
it
was
that
very
stormy
day
i
say
that
day
for
i
can
not
name
the
date
i
only
know
that
it
was
a
day
it
had
rained
all
the
morning
then
the
sky
had
cleared
and
at
last
high
above
the
misty
whiteness
of
the
lower
atmosphere
a
rainbow
threw
its
glorious
arch
one
end
rested
on
the
oaks
of
fic칩briga
close
to
the
sea
and
the
other
on
the
woods
of
saldeoro
supreme
in
its
simplicity
the
rainbow
can
be
compared
to
nothing
else
any
more
than
an
absolutely
ideal
and
typical
form
can
be
a
rainbow
is
the
epitome
the
alpha
and
omega
of
visible
color
florentina
was
in
her
room
not
threading
beads
nor
embroidering
satin
with
gold
thread
but
cutting
out
garments
from
patterns
made
of
newspaper
she
was
squatting
on
the
floor
in
the
attitudes
of
a
fidgetty
child
at
play
now
sitting
on
her
heels
now
on
all
fours
and
plying
the
scissors
without
a
moment
respite
by
her
side
was
a
heap
of
pieces
of
woollen
stuff
calico
cotton
print
and
other
materials
that
she
had
been
that
very
morning
to
buy
at
villamojada
in
spite
of
wind
and
weather
and
snipping
here
and
cutting
there
she
was
fast
evolving
sleeves
skirts
and
bodies
they
were
not
perhaps
models
of
dressmaking
nor
was
the
exactitude
of
the
patterns
to
be
entirely
relied
on
for
they
also
were
of
her
own
devising
however
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
acknowledge
their
shortcomings
and
she
hoped
that
might
conduce
to
a
happy
result
her
worthy
father
had
said
to
her
as
he
saw
her
sitting
to
work
bless
me
child
one
would
think
there
were
no
dressmakers
in
the
world
you
can
not
imagine
how
it
annoys
me
to
see
a
young
lady
of
good
position
crawling
about
on
the
floor
with
shears
in
her
it
is
not
at
all
the
right
thing
i
can
not
bear
that
you
should
work
to
clothe
yourself
even
and
am
i
to
submit
to
see
you
working
for
others
what
are
dressmakers
for
heh
what
are
dressmakers
for
a
dressmaker
would
do
it
much
better
than
i
shall
replied
florentina
laughing
but
then
you
see
it
would
not
be
my
doing
papa
and
to
do
it
myself
is
the
very
thing
i
most
want
he
left
her
to
her
own
devices
but
not
alone
for
in
the
middle
of
the
alcove
between
the
bed
and
the
wardrobe
stood
an
sofa
and
on
the
sofa
lay
two
blankets
and
at
one
end
on
a
pile
of
pillows
lay
a
weary
little
head
the
face
was
haggard
and
colorless
asleep
sunk
rather
in
an
uneasy
lethargy
broken
now
and
again
by
violent
starting
and
terrors
however
a
calmer
state
had
supervened
by
when
florentina
father
came
into
the
room
again
followed
by
golfin
the
surgeon
went
up
to
the
sofa
and
leaned
over
nela
watching
her
face
she
seems
to
be
sleeping
more
quietly
now
he
said
we
must
have
no
noise
what
do
you
think
of
my
daughter
said
don
manuel
laughing
do
you
see
all
the
trouble
she
is
taking
now
be
quite
impartial
don
teodoro
is
there
any
reason
why
she
should
vex
me
honestly
when
there
is
no
necessity
for
taking
so
much
trouble
why
should
she
do
so
what
pleasure
can
it
be
to
me
to
see
my
daughter
wasting
all
i
give
her
for
wasting
it
on
others
and
besides
this
mania
for
low
occupations
for
low
occupations
let
her
please
herself
replied
golfin
looking
down
admiringly
at
the
girl
every
young
lady
has
her
own
way
of
wasting
her
and
i
am
not
to
object
if
her
charity
brings
her
to
destitution
to
bankruptcy
exclaimed
don
manuel
marching
up
and
down
the
room
in
pompous
indignation
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
besides
is
there
no
better
method
of
charity
than
this
she
wished
to
show
her
gratitude
to
god
for
my
nephew
recovery
well
and
good
very
proper
a
very
christian
feeling
but
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
he
stopped
in
front
of
nela
and
looked
at
her
kindly
now
would
it
not
have
been
better
he
said
if
instead
of
bringing
this
poor
girl
into
the
house
my
daughter
had
organized
one
of
those
grand
charitable
affairs
which
are
the
fashion
even
at
court
and
which
give
all
the
best
people
in
society
an
opportunity
of
displaying
their
good
feeling
why
did
you
not
think
of
holding
a
lottery
we
could
easily
have
sold
any
number
of
tickets
among
our
friends
and
have
collected
a
handsome
sum
of
money
to
give
away
to
charitable
asylums
why
you
might
have
got
up
an
association
among
the
gentry
of
villamojada
and
the
neighborhood
or
have
invited
all
our
acquaintance
at
santa
irene
de
camp칩
to
join
you
and
have
held
meetings
and
collected
a
great
deal
of
nay
why
not
have
got
up
a
i
would
have
undertaken
to
provide
the
beasts
and
the
or
amateur
theatricals
last
night
do침a
sof칤a
and
i
were
talking
of
that
very
thing
learn
from
her
my
dear
learn
from
her
the
poor
owe
more
to
her
than
i
can
tell
you
there
are
all
the
families
who
live
by
the
employment
they
get
in
working
the
lotteries
there
are
all
the
professionals
and
subordinates
who
make
money
by
the
theatrical
performances
oh
my
dear
the
paupers
in
the
workhouse
are
not
the
only
poor
sof칤a
told
me
that
they
made
a
little
fortune
out
of
the
masked
balls
they
gave
this
winter
a
good
deal
of
it
was
spent
of
course
in
gas
in
renting
the
theatre
in
service
and
so
forth
still
there
was
a
morsel
of
bread
left
for
the
poor
after
but
if
you
do
not
believe
me
read
the
statistics
child
read
the
statistics
florentina
laughed
and
found
no
better
answer
than
to
repeat
the
surgeon
apology
for
her
every
young
lady
has
her
own
way
of
wasting
her
but
don
teodoro
remonstrated
don
manuel
in
great
disgust
you
must
admit
that
no
one
else
does
it
as
my
daughter
does
i
quite
admit
it
said
golfin
with
meaning
and
looking
at
the
girl
no
one
is
like
florentina
and
yet
with
all
her
faults
said
the
father
drawing
her
to
him
with
all
her
faults
i
love
her
better
than
my
life
this
little
hussy
is
worth
her
weight
in
come
tell
me
which
do
you
like
best
aldeacorba
de
suso
or
santa
irene
de
camp칩
i
do
not
dislike
aldeacorba
ah
little
puss
i
see
which
way
the
wind
blows
do
you
know
that
at
this
very
moment
my
brother
is
talking
seriously
to
his
son
family
affairs
well
and
something
very
good
is
to
come
of
it
all
look
don
teodoro
at
my
daughter
face
it
is
as
red
as
roses
in
may
now
i
am
off
to
hear
what
my
brother
has
to
say
what
my
brother
has
to
say
and
the
worthy
man
departed
golfin
went
back
to
nela
did
she
sleep
last
night
he
asked
very
little
i
heard
her
sobbing
and
crying
all
night
but
she
shall
have
a
good
bed
for
which
i
have
sent
to
villamojada
and
i
will
put
her
in
the
little
room
next
to
mine
poor
little
nela
said
the
doctor
you
can
not
imagine
what
an
interest
i
feel
in
this
hapless
creature
some
people
would
laugh
at
it
but
we
at
any
rate
are
not
made
of
stone
what
little
we
have
done
to
improve
the
condition
of
this
poor
child
ought
to
be
done
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
human
race
there
are
many
thousands
of
beings
in
the
world
in
the
same
plight
as
nela
who
knows
them
where
are
they
they
are
lost
in
the
desert
of
society
for
society
has
its
deserts
in
the
dark
places
of
life
in
the
solitudes
of
field
labor
in
mines
in
factories
we
pass
them
without
even
seeing
them
we
give
them
alms
perhaps
but
without
knowing
how
are
we
to
be
cognizant
of
so
base
a
class
of
humanity
at
first
nela
attracted
me
because
i
thought
that
hers
was
an
exceptional
nature
but
as
i
have
thought
more
i
have
felt
that
hers
is
after
all
only
one
of
the
commonest
cases
it
is
an
instance
of
the
condition
to
which
a
moral
nature
must
be
reduced
a
nature
apt
for
good
apt
for
learning
apt
for
virtue
but
which
can
never
develop
its
powers
in
the
neglect
and
isolation
to
which
it
is
condemned
they
live
blind
in
spirit
just
as
pablo
pen치guilas
lived
blind
in
body
though
he
possessed
the
latent
faculty
of
sight
florentina
was
listening
with
eager
sympathy
and
intelligence
to
the
surgeon
speech
look
at
her
he
went
on
there
she
lies
she
has
a
beautiful
fancy
acute
feelings
and
can
love
with
devotion
and
tenderness
she
is
gifted
with
a
remarkable
aptitude
for
every
grace
of
mind
while
at
the
same
time
she
is
full
of
the
grossest
superstitions
her
religious
ideas
are
vague
monstrous
and
heterodox
and
her
moral
sense
needs
guidance
as
much
as
her
natural
intelligence
she
has
had
no
education
but
what
she
has
been
able
to
give
herself
like
a
tree
that
gets
no
nourishment
but
that
of
its
own
withered
and
fallen
leaves
she
owes
absolutely
nothing
to
any
one
else
in
all
her
life
she
has
never
been
taught
a
single
lesson
never
heard
a
word
of
loving
counsel
nor
a
precept
of
pious
dogma
she
is
guided
entirely
by
examples
which
she
adapts
to
her
own
instincts
and
desires
her
criticisms
are
all
her
own
and
as
she
is
full
of
imagination
and
feeling
and
the
strongest
native
impulse
of
her
soul
is
to
worship
something
she
has
worshipped
nature
after
the
fashion
of
primitive
races
all
her
ideals
are
naturalistic
and
if
you
do
not
quite
understand
what
i
mean
dear
florentina
i
must
explain
myself
more
exactly
another
time
she
has
a
really
artistic
passion
for
form
and
beauty
her
whole
nature
and
her
affections
all
centre
round
this
idea
the
gifts
and
graces
of
the
mind
are
to
her
an
unknown
realm
of
beauty
a
land
of
which
she
knows
only
so
much
as
some
traveller
might
of
a
new
country
on
whose
shores
he
had
been
shipwrecked
the
great
news
of
the
gospel
the
greatest
achievement
of
the
spirit
of
humanity
has
hardly
even
sounded
in
her
ears
she
has
the
same
faint
suspicion
of
it
that
asiatic
nations
may
have
of
european
culture
and
if
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
dear
florentina
i
must
explain
myself
more
exactly
another
time
but
she
is
very
capable
of
making
rapid
progress
in
a
short
time
and
of
rising
to
a
higher
level
nay
to
our
own
show
her
a
little
light
and
she
will
fly
across
the
centuries
she
has
wandered
from
the
track
and
can
not
see
far
but
give
her
light
and
she
will
find
her
way
again
no
one
yet
has
ever
put
the
torch
in
her
hand
for
pablo
pen치guilas
in
his
own
ignorance
of
all
external
truth
contributed
largely
but
unconsciously
to
increase
her
errors
such
a
fantastic
and
extravagant
idealist
was
not
the
best
master
for
a
nature
like
hers
we
must
set
truth
before
the
poor
child
who
is
like
a
being
raised
from
the
dead
of
a
remote
past
we
will
teach
her
to
know
the
graces
of
the
mind
we
will
bring
her
down
to
our
own
century
we
will
give
her
soul
a
strength
which
as
yet
it
has
not
and
put
a
noble
christian
conscience
in
the
place
of
her
savage
naturalism
and
wild
superstitions
we
have
an
admirable
field
to
work
in
a
virgin
soil
on
which
to
sow
the
seed
of
centuries
of
growth
we
may
make
time
fly
fast
over
her
head
showing
her
the
truth
it
has
revealed
and
so
create
a
new
being
for
indeed
dear
florentina
it
is
the
same
thing
as
creating
a
new
being
and
if
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
i
must
explain
myself
more
exactly
another
time
florentina
though
she
made
no
pretensions
to
learning
thought
that
she
did
understand
what
golfin
had
meant
by
his
quaint
and
original
harangue
she
herself
was
about
to
add
some
remarks
on
the
subject
but
at
that
moment
nela
woke
her
eyes
timidly
wandered
round
the
room
and
then
rested
alternately
on
the
two
faces
that
looked
down
at
her
you
are
not
frightened
said
florentina
gently
frightened
no
se침ora
you
are
very
kind
and
the
se침or
too
are
you
not
glad
to
be
here
what
are
you
afraid
of
golfin
took
her
hand
speak
frankly
and
truly
he
said
which
of
us
do
you
like
best
florentina
or
me
nela
made
no
reply
and
the
others
smiled
but
the
child
remained
moodily
grave
now
listen
to
me
you
silly
little
thing
the
surgeon
went
on
you
have
to
make
up
your
mind
to
live
with
one
of
us
florentina
will
stay
here
i
shall
go
away
decide
for
one
or
the
other
which
do
you
like
best
marianela
looked
from
one
to
the
other
without
finding
any
definite
answer
finally
her
eyes
rested
on
those
of
golfin
i
believe
i
am
the
man
of
her
but
that
is
not
fair
to
florentina
nela
she
will
be
vexed
the
poor
child
smiled
and
putting
out
a
feeble
hand
to
florentina
she
murmured
i
do
not
want
to
vex
her
but
even
while
she
spoke
she
turned
ashy
pale
she
strained
her
neck
her
eyes
seemed
starting
out
of
her
head
she
was
listening
to
a
sound
that
was
full
of
terrors
to
her
she
had
heard
footsteps
he
is
coming
exclaimed
golfin
sympathizing
in
his
patient
alarm
yes
here
he
comes
cried
florentina
and
she
flew
to
the
door
it
was
he
pablo
had
opened
the
door
and
walked
softly
into
the
room
straight
in
from
the
habit
he
had
acquired
during
years
of
blindness
he
came
in
smiling
and
his
eyes
freed
from
the
bandage
which
he
had
himself
removed
looked
straight
before
him
they
were
as
yet
unaccustomed
to
the
muscular
action
which
makes
them
turn
and
were
hardly
aware
of
objects
lying
out
of
the
direct
line
of
vision
it
was
literally
true
of
him
as
it
is
of
many
who
never
were
blind
in
their
lives
that
he
only
saw
what
was
directly
under
his
eyes
cousin
said
he
going
towards
her
why
have
you
not
been
to
see
me
i
have
had
to
come
to
look
for
you
your
father
told
me
you
were
doing
some
work
for
the
poor
so
i
suppose
i
must
forgive
you
florentina
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
was
annoyed
pablo
had
not
observed
either
golfin
or
nela
and
florentina
intending
to
keep
him
from
approaching
the
sofa
went
towards
the
window
then
picking
up
some
pieces
of
stuff
she
sat
down
as
if
she
were
going
to
sew
the
full
light
of
the
sun
fell
upon
her
shedding
a
vivid
glow
on
all
her
left
side
and
giving
the
most
charming
relief
to
her
pretty
head
with
its
russet
brown
hair
her
beauty
seemed
radiant
like
the
very
personification
and
incarnation
of
light
her
hair
was
somewhat
in
disorder
and
her
thin
morning
dress
followed
the
graceful
lines
of
her
slender
figure
while
her
simple
and
dignified
pose
was
worthy
of
the
noblest
ideals
of
art
cousin
she
said
with
a
slight
frown
on
her
pretty
brow
don
teodoro
has
not
yet
given
you
leave
to
take
your
bandage
off
that
is
not
right
he
will
give
me
leave
presently
said
the
young
man
laughing
and
it
can
not
hurt
me
i
am
really
quite
well
and
if
it
did
do
me
harm
i
should
not
no
i
should
not
care
if
i
became
blind
again
after
having
seen
you
and
what
good
would
that
be
to
you
said
florentina
reprovingly
i
was
alone
in
my
room
my
father
is
gone
out
after
speaking
to
me
about
you
you
know
what
he
said
no
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
the
girl
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
work
but
i
my
father
is
very
kind
and
reasonable
and
we
are
very
fond
of
each
other
well
when
my
father
had
left
me
i
took
off
the
bandage
and
looked
out
at
the
fields
i
saw
the
rainbow
and
i
felt
quite
overcome
with
admiration
and
with
religious
feeling
too
florentina
i
do
not
know
why
that
grand
spectacle
which
i
had
never
seen
before
should
have
given
me
so
intense
a
feeling
of
the
harmony
of
creation
i
do
not
know
why
looking
at
the
perfect
blending
of
its
colors
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
you
i
do
not
know
why
as
i
saw
the
rainbow
i
said
to
myself
have
felt
this
all
before
i
felt
again
exactly
as
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
you
florentina
my
darling
my
heart
seemed
ready
to
burst
my
bosom
and
i
could
not
help
crying
i
cried
a
great
deal
and
my
tears
blinded
me
again
for
a
few
minutes
i
called
you
and
you
did
not
answer
when
i
could
see
again
the
rainbow
had
vanished
i
went
to
look
for
you
i
thought
you
were
in
the
garden
i
went
down
stairs
up
stairs
and
here
i
am
and
now
here
i
find
you
so
lovely
that
i
feel
as
if
i
had
never
seen
you
rightly
till
never
till
because
now
i
have
had
time
to
learn
to
compare
you
with
others
i
have
seen
several
women
and
they
are
all
horrible
by
your
side
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
you
have
lived
through
the
years
of
my
nay
nay
what
i
believe
is
that
you
came
into
being
at
the
moment
when
light
dawned
upon
my
comprehension
that
my
own
mind
created
you
at
the
moment
when
i
first
was
lord
of
the
visible
world
they
had
often
told
me
that
there
was
not
a
living
creature
to
compare
with
you
and
i
would
not
believe
it
but
i
believe
it
now
as
surely
as
i
believe
in
the
light
of
heaven
and
as
he
spoke
he
fell
on
one
knee
florentina
startled
and
abashed
looked
up
from
her
sewing
cousin
for
pity
sake
she
murmured
cousin
for
pity
sake
exclaimed
pablo
with
frank
enthusiasm
why
why
are
you
so
lovely
my
father
is
most
reasonable
i
can
say
nothing
against
his
arguments
or
his
florentina
do
you
know
i
thought
i
could
never
love
you
i
thought
i
could
love
some
one
not
you
but
what
can
i
do
thank
god
my
love
and
my
reason
are
one
my
father
to
whom
i
confessed
my
mistake
told
me
that
i
had
loved
a
hideous
monster
but
now
i
can
say
that
i
worship
an
angel
the
ignorant
blind
man
can
see
and
at
last
pay
due
homage
to
real
beauty
and
yet
i
can
not
help
trembling
do
you
not
see
me
tremble
seeing
you
i
have
but
one
desire
and
that
is
to
take
you
in
my
arms
and
clasp
you
to
my
heart
enfolding
you
holding
you
tightly
very
tightly
and
pablo
who
was
now
kneeling
on
both
knees
clasped
his
arms
across
his
breast
oh
i
do
not
know
what
i
feel
he
went
on
stammering
and
turning
pale
with
agitation
every
day
i
discover
some
new
world
florentina
first
i
discovered
the
world
of
light
i
have
discovered
another
is
it
possible
that
you
so
lovely
so
divine
are
to
be
mine
the
wife
of
my
heart
he
seemed
about
to
fall
to
the
ground
in
a
and
florentina
leaned
forward
to
support
him
pablo
took
her
hand
then
lifting
her
wide
loose
sleeve
he
kissed
her
wrist
and
arm
with
eager
passion
counting
the
kisses
one
two
three
four
ah
i
am
dying
be
quiet
stop
cried
florentina
standing
up
and
making
her
cousin
rise
too
doctor
golfin
will
you
scold
him
your
bandage
on
at
once
cried
teodoro
go
to
your
room
and
keep
quiet
the
young
man
in
the
utmost
confusion
turned
to
that
side
of
the
room
and
brought
his
eyes
to
bear
on
the
surgeon
standing
by
the
sofa
that
was
covered
with
blankets
are
you
here
don
teodoro
he
said
going
up
to
him
yes
i
am
here
said
golfin
very
gravely
you
ought
to
go
back
to
your
room
and
put
the
bandage
on
again
i
will
go
with
you
i
am
perfectly
well
but
of
course
i
will
obey
only
first
let
me
see
what
is
here
he
was
looking
at
the
blankets
and
between
them
at
a
ghastly
head
anything
but
fair
to
look
upon
in
fact
nela
nose
seemed
to
have
become
sharper
her
eyes
smaller
her
mouth
less
her
face
more
freckled
her
hair
thinner
and
her
forehead
lower
her
eyes
were
closed
she
breathed
with
difficulty
her
livid
lips
were
parted
and
the
hapless
child
seemed
to
be
at
her
last
gasp
with
the
look
of
death
on
her
face
already
ah
exclaimed
pablo
my
father
told
me
that
florentina
had
given
shelter
to
some
poor
creature
how
good
of
her
you
poor
child
you
may
be
thankful
for
you
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
angel
are
you
ill
in
my
house
you
shall
want
for
nothing
my
cousin
is
the
very
image
of
god
on
this
poor
child
is
very
ill
is
she
not
doctor
yes
said
golfin
she
must
be
left
alone
and
hear
no
more
talking
then
i
am
gone
pablo
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
the
head
which
seemed
to
his
unaccustomed
eyes
the
most
terrible
symbol
of
all
human
misery
and
wretchedness
nela
raised
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
her
master
pablo
felt
as
if
they
gazed
at
him
from
the
depths
of
a
tomb
so
profound
was
their
expression
of
sorrow
and
despair
then
nela
freed
one
hand
from
beneath
the
coverings
a
feeble
burning
rough
little
hand
and
took
that
of
the
young
man
at
her
touch
pablo
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
and
uttered
a
cry
that
came
from
his
very
soul
there
was
a
terrible
pause
one
of
those
lulls
which
precede
the
catastrophes
of
life
as
they
do
the
convulsions
of
nature
as
though
to
add
to
their
solemnity
then
in
a
quavering
voice
that
thrilled
the
with
its
tragical
sadness
nela
spoke
yes
she
said
i
am
nela
slowly
and
as
if
she
were
lifting
some
too
heavy
weight
she
raised
her
master
hand
to
her
dry
lips
and
kissed
it
kissed
it
again
and
then
with
a
third
attempt
her
lips
remained
motionless
on
the
hand
they
were
all
silent
looking
at
her
the
first
to
break
the
silence
was
pablo
is
this
you
he
said
you
and
the
thoughts
that
crowded
on
his
mind
checked
his
utterance
of
any
he
would
have
liked
to
discover
some
new
language
in
which
to
utter
them
just
as
he
had
already
discovered
the
two
new
worlds
of
light
and
of
the
love
of
external
beauty
he
could
do
nothing
but
look
at
her
look
at
nela
and
remember
that
darkened
world
in
which
he
had
lived
his
passions
and
the
dreams
and
errors
of
his
blindness
all
wandering
and
lost
in
its
obscurity
florentina
wiping
away
her
tears
leaned
over
nela
to
look
into
her
face
and
golfin
watching
her
and
knowing
too
well
what
he
saw
exclaimed
in
a
voice
like
a
knell
it
has
killed
her
the
sight
of
you
has
killed
her
then
turning
to
pablo
he
said
sternly
go
at
once
to
your
room
dying
dying
so
without
any
cause
cried
florentina
in
despair
and
laying
her
hand
lightly
on
nela
brow
mar칤a
she
said
marianela
she
called
her
by
her
name
again
and
again
leaning
over
her
and
looking
at
her
as
we
might
look
over
the
margin
of
a
well
at
some
one
who
has
fallen
into
it
and
who
is
drowning
in
the
depth
and
blackness
of
its
waters
she
does
not
answer
said
pablo
golfin
watching
her
ebbing
vitality
perceived
that
her
pulse
still
throbbed
under
his
touch
pablo
bent
over
her
and
putting
his
lips
close
to
her
ear
he
called
her
once
more
nela
nela
my
friend
my
dear
she
turned
a
little
opened
her
eyes
and
moved
her
hands
she
looked
as
if
her
spirit
had
returned
from
some
far
away
flight
seeing
gaze
fixed
upon
her
with
anxious
curiosity
she
turned
aside
abashed
and
alarmed
and
tried
to
hide
her
face
as
if
she
were
a
guilty
thing
what
is
the
matter
with
her
asked
florentina
vehemently
don
teodoro
save
her
if
you
are
a
if
you
do
not
save
her
you
are
a
charlatan
the
young
girl
charitable
instincts
were
spurring
her
to
positive
rage
nela
repeated
the
lad
in
the
deepest
distress
and
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
which
the
sight
of
his
little
comrade
had
given
him
you
seem
to
be
afraid
of
me
what
have
i
done
to
you
the
dying
girl
put
out
her
hand
to
clasp
florentina
and
pressed
it
to
her
breast
and
then
she
did
the
same
with
pablo
afterwards
she
once
more
pressed
them
both
with
all
the
strength
she
could
command
her
sunken
eyes
looked
from
one
to
the
other
but
her
gaze
was
vague
and
remote
it
seemed
to
come
from
some
inner
depth
of
darkness
and
despair
as
though
she
were
indeed
the
drowning
wretch
in
the
well
sinking
lower
every
instant
suddenly
her
breathing
became
difficult
she
sighed
and
clutched
the
two
hands
she
held
with
convulsive
energy
teodoro
had
turned
the
house
upside
down
had
sent
for
medicines
and
powerful
stimulants
and
was
doing
all
in
his
power
to
arrest
the
swift
extinction
of
this
young
life
it
is
hard
he
said
to
stop
a
drop
of
water
that
is
trickling
falling
away
down
down
and
within
an
inch
or
two
of
the
great
but
i
will
try
he
sent
away
every
one
but
florentina
whom
he
kept
in
the
room
but
the
stimulants
and
irritants
with
which
he
endeavored
to
bring
back
ebbing
life
to
the
frail
body
only
served
to
restore
some
little
muscular
action
and
in
spite
of
this
she
was
sinking
every
minute
it
is
cruelty
cried
golfin
desperately
as
he
snatched
away
the
mustard
and
the
irritants
we
are
tormentors
and
torturers
it
is
like
setting
dogs
on
a
dying
man
that
the
pain
may
keep
him
alive
to
suffer
away
with
it
all
and
is
there
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
but
what
god
will
do
but
what
is
the
matter
with
her
death
he
shouted
with
a
delirious
rage
of
grief
a
medical
man
but
what
illness
is
it
that
has
brought
her
to
death
death
he
repeated
you
do
not
understand
me
i
want
to
know
of
what
of
how
can
i
tell
you
whether
it
is
shame
or
jealousy
or
wounded
pride
or
grief
or
disappointed
love
that
has
killed
her
a
strange
catalogue
of
symptoms
no
no
we
know
nothing
nothing
but
useless
details
what
doctors
i
tell
you
we
know
nothing
a
little
on
the
surface
that
is
all
and
this
what
is
this
a
sudden
attack
of
inflammation
meningitis
perhaps
and
what
is
that
a
name
death
but
is
it
possible
that
any
one
should
die
like
this
without
any
known
cause
without
any
sort
of
disease
oh
don
teodoro
what
is
the
matter
with
her
how
should
i
know
but
you
are
a
doctor
of
eyes
not
of
passions
passions
exclaimed
florentina
looking
down
at
the
senseless
girl
you
poor
child
what
passions
are
you
dying
of
ask
your
future
husband
florentina
stood
lost
in
utter
amazement
poor
thing
she
cried
with
a
choked
sob
can
mere
grief
kill
in
this
way
when
i
picked
her
up
at
she
was
in
a
high
fever
but
that
is
not
enough
no
not
enough
to
kill
her
you
say
it
is
not
enough
god
and
nature
say
that
it
is
it
is
as
if
she
had
been
stabbed
remember
what
those
eyes
now
closing
forever
saw
a
short
while
since
remember
that
a
blind
man
loved
her
and
that
he
is
blind
no
longer
that
he
has
seen
her
seen
her
the
shock
was
a
oh
what
a
terrible
mysterious
no
it
is
no
mystery
cried
the
surgeon
almost
wildly
it
is
the
awful
collapse
of
an
illusion
the
rude
blow
of
reality
the
miserable
destroyer
which
has
come
between
two
noble
souls
and
i
i
brought
that
reality
home
to
them
oh
it
is
a
wretched
mystery
repeated
florentina
not
understanding
the
current
of
his
thoughts
a
mystery
no
repeated
teodoro
with
increasing
agitation
it
is
bare
reality
the
sudden
swallowing
up
of
a
whole
world
of
illusions
reality
to
him
meant
a
new
life
to
her
anguish
suffocation
humiliation
sorrow
contempt
an
empty
life
jealousy
death
and
all
for
and
all
for
one
pair
of
eyes
opened
to
see
light
and
reality
reality
i
can
not
get
the
word
out
of
my
brain
it
seems
to
be
written
there
in
letters
of
fire
all
for
one
pair
of
and
grief
can
kill
so
quickly
without
giving
us
time
to
try
a
remedy
i
do
not
know
said
golfin
bewildered
confounded
helpless
in
view
of
the
mystic
characters
of
the
book
of
life
and
death
which
science
may
pore
over
but
may
not
decipher
its
dark
riddle
you
do
not
know
cried
florentina
desperately
then
why
are
you
a
doctor
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
he
reiterated
striking
his
dishevelled
head
with
his
heavy
yes
one
thing
i
know
and
that
is
that
we
know
nothing
but
the
phenomena
of
life
i
i
am
a
mender
of
eyes
and
nothing
more
he
fixed
his
gaze
with
absorbed
attention
on
the
little
figure
which
was
hovering
on
the
between
a
living
woman
and
a
corpse
soul
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
bitter
questioning
what
is
passing
in
you
now
florentina
burst
into
tears
the
soul
she
murmured
and
her
head
drooped
on
her
breast
it
is
fled
no
said
teodoro
taking
nela
hand
there
is
still
some
life
left
but
so
little
that
it
would
seem
as
if
the
soul
were
indeed
far
away
and
had
left
only
the
breath
behind
lord
have
mercy
exclaimed
the
young
girl
and
began
to
pray
alas
hapless
spirit
murmured
the
surgeon
you
were
but
indeed
they
both
bent
over
her
watching
her
closely
her
lips
are
moving
cried
florentina
she
is
speaking
yes
her
lips
parted
she
said
something
a
word
two
three
what
is
she
saying
each
asked
the
other
but
neither
of
them
could
understand
her
she
spoke
perhaps
in
the
tongue
that
is
known
to
those
who
live
the
life
eternal
this
was
the
end
her
lips
moved
no
more
they
remained
showing
a
row
of
little
white
teeth
teodoro
bent
over
her
and
kissing
nela
forehead
he
said
in
a
steady
voice
woman
you
did
well
to
quit
this
world
but
florentina
voice
was
choked
with
tears
and
sobs
as
she
said
i
wanted
to
make
her
happy
and
she
would
not
be
chapter
xxii
farewell
strange
and
wonderful
to
tell
nela
who
had
never
in
her
life
had
a
room
nor
clothes
nor
shoes
nor
food
nor
sympathy
nor
relations
nor
any
earthly
thing
of
her
own
not
even
a
name
was
buried
in
a
style
which
caused
no
small
amount
of
envy
among
the
living
in
socartes
this
posthumous
splendor
was
the
bitterest
irony
ever
known
in
these
metalliferous
regions
se침orita
florentina
acting
on
her
generous
impulses
consoled
herself
for
the
disappointment
of
not
having
been
able
to
help
nela
alive
by
the
satisfaction
of
doing
honor
to
her
hapless
remains
after
death
some
materialists
criticised
her
severely
but
for
our
part
we
regarded
it
as
an
additional
proof
of
her
refined
when
nela
was
carried
to
the
grave
the
curious
who
came
to
gaze
at
her
thought
her
almost
pretty
wonderful
to
say
at
least
so
they
said
it
was
the
first
time
a
compliment
had
ever
been
paid
her
the
funeral
was
magnificent
and
the
priests
of
villamojada
opened
their
mouths
wide
in
astonishment
when
they
found
themselves
receiving
money
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
la
canela
daughter
it
was
bewildering
amazing
to
think
that
a
being
whose
social
importance
had
been
about
equal
to
that
of
a
worm
or
a
fly
should
prove
the
occasion
of
so
much
burning
of
tapers
of
so
much
hanging
of
drapery
and
of
making
so
many
choristers
and
sacristans
hoarse
nay
it
was
so
astounding
as
to
be
positively
amusing
nothing
else
was
talked
of
for
at
least
six
weeks
the
surprise
and
indeed
to
be
frank
the
indignation
of
this
worthy
little
world
culminated
one
day
when
two
waggons
loaded
with
enormous
blocks
of
fine
white
stone
were
descried
approaching
by
the
in
se침ana
mind
particularly
a
hideous
subversion
of
ideas
took
place
a
cataclysm
resulting
in
mental
chaos
when
she
brought
herself
to
believe
that
those
fine
white
stones
were
to
build
nela
tomb
if
an
ox
had
taken
to
flying
or
her
husband
to
making
speeches
it
could
not
have
roused
her
from
her
stupefaction
the
parish
registers
of
villamojada
were
searched
for
of
course
it
was
indispensable
that
she
should
have
a
name
now
she
was
dead
though
she
had
done
without
one
during
her
life
as
is
proved
by
this
very
history
where
she
has
borne
various
names
and
this
indispensable
requisite
having
been
found
and
duly
placed
on
the
records
of
the
dead
the
magnificent
tomb
which
stood
up
proudly
among
the
rustic
crosses
of
the
graveyard
at
aldeacorba
had
this
epitaph
engraved

to

the
grand

sepulchre
erected
in
the
cemetery
by
the
piety
and
affection
of

exemplary
friend
and
were
struck
with
admiration
without

these

were

in

the
most
remarkable
object
to
be
seen
at
aldeacorba
is
a
magnificent
monument
erected
in
the
cemetery
over
the
grave
of

with

told
us
of

the

beauty
of
this
wealthy
gentlewoman

whenever
she
appeared
at

the

composed
in
honor
of
this
noble
damsel
by
all

is
beyond
all
calculation
on

saw
at
once
that
the

i
determined
to
tell

and
the
truth
as
i
have
told

we
must
now
bid
farewell
forever
to

fix

this

is
a

in

and
as

it
is
a
brilliant

the
spain
which

for
it
is
worthy

beside

it

a
story
of

in

and
the
most
noted
characters

figure
in

pages
which
are
a
series
of
picturesque
descriptions
of
roman
life

manners
in

imperial
city

in
those
luxurious
retreats
at

elsewhere
to
which
the
wealthy

used
to
retreat
from

summer
it
is
full
of
stirring
scenes
in
the
streets
in
the
palaces
in
the
temples

in
the
amphitheatre

the
actors
therein
represent
every
phase
of

from
the
treacherous
and

were
never

love
in
ancient
by
robert
hamerling
from
the
german
by
mary
safford
opinions
of
the
press
in
germany
is
a
poem
which
seems
to
have
been
accidentally
clad
in
the
garb
of
prose
every
portion
of
it
is
permeated
and
transfigured
by
the
loftiest
ideas
of
humanity
yet
what
we
particularly
admire
in
this
brilliant
work
is
the
great
skill
with
which
the
greek
local
coloring
is
reproduced
hamerling
in
this
his
latest
creation
proves
himself
to
be
a
delineator
of
mankind
par
excellence
the
description
of
characters
is
as
truthful
as
it
is
interesting
is
a
historical
picture
for
the
incidents

persons
within
the

of
the

are
in
the
main
historical
only
the
minor

the
whole

revolves
about
the
central
figure

stands
forth
with
majestic
grandeur
no
reader
will
be
able
to
escape
the
lofty
poetic
charm
of
the
book
leipsic
it
is
one
of
the
great
excellencies
of
this
romance
this
lofty
song
of
the
genius
of
the
greeks
that
it
is
composed
with
perfect
artistic
symmetry
in
the
treatment
of
the
different
parts
and
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
is
thoroughly
harmonious
in
tone
and
coloring
therefore
in
we
are
given
a
book
which
could
only
proceed
from
the
union
of
an
artistic
nature
and
a
thoughtful
mind
a
book
that
does
not
depict
fiery
passions
in
dramatic
conflict
but
with
dignified
composure
leads
the
conflict
therein

the

a
whimsical
wooing
by
anton
giulio
barrili
author
of
the
eleventh
commandment
from
the
italian
by
clara
bell
some
months
ago
we
had
occasion
to
praise
a
pleasant
novel
of
modern
italian
life
by
the
author
of
the
above
story
the
present
is
not
less
deserving
of
praise
it
is
just
the
very
thing
to
play
as
an
afterpiece
cast
into
purely
dramatic
form
indeed
without
any
change
at
all
it
would
form
a
sparkling
little
comedietta
for
a
private
theatrical
party
the
little
volume
is
most
charming
it
is
very
brief
but
every
line
sparkles
and
we
find
it
all
too
short
whimsical
wooing
is
the
title
under
which
bell
introduces
a
episode
by
anton
guilio
barrili
to
american
readers
it
is
a
sketch
of
italian
life
at
once
rich
and
strong
but
nevertheless
discreet
in
sentiment
and
graceful
in
diction
it
is
the
old
story

the
fallacy
of
trusting

a

love

a
romance
of
a
soul
ernestine
by
wilhelmine
von
hillern
from
the
german
by
is
a
work
of
positive
genius
an
english
critic
has
likened
the
conception
of
the
heroine
in
her
childhood
to
george
eliot
maggie
tulliver
and
truly
there
is
a
certain
resemblance
but
there
is
in
the
piece
a
much
stronger
suggestion
of
george
calm
mastery
of
the
secret
springs
of
human
action
and
george
gift
of
laying
bare
the
life
of
a
human
soul

of
likeness
between
particulars
characters

situations
here
and
those
with
which
we
are
familiar
in
george

york
evening
post
ernestine
in
her
childhood
somewhat
reminds
us
of
maggie
tulliver
in
the
mill
on
the
floss
and
in
her
maidenhood
of
princess
for
many
a
year
as
child
and
woman
she
grieved
that
she
had
not
been
born
a
man
in
fact
she
was
a
downright
and
fearless
champion
of
woman
rights
but
in
the
end
she
yields
and
as
we
take
leave
of
her
we
hear
her
saying
to
her
husband
thank
god
that
i
am
a
woman
and
that
i
am
yours
very
pretty
though
perhaps
too
sad
are
the
opening
scenes
in
which
we
first
make
her
acquaintance
there
are
many
humorous
touches
throughout
the
work
which
afford
a
pleasant
relief
to
the
more
pathetic
portions
in
fact
in
many
places
as
we
read
the
story
we
saw
that
it
would
easily
adapt
itself
to
the
purposes

the
dramatist

ranthorpe
a
novel
by
george
henry
lewes
it
is
not
difficult
to
explain
why
ranthorpe
was
not
a
success
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
a
popular
novel
but
the
explanation
will
probably
give
the
reason
why
it
has
been
since
recalled
to
the
attention
of
the
reading
world
it
was
of
too
didactic
a
quality
to
suit
the
tastes
of
in
search
of
mere
sensation
it
is
full
of
moralizings
and
although
the
topics
are
secular
enough
it
is
rather
preachy
but
there
is
a
good
deal
of
wisdom
in
it
that
is
not
without
its
use
the
hero
of
the
book

career
goes
first
into
poetry
and
fails
then
into
the
drama

his
tragedy
is
d
the
main
interest
of
the
volume
is
in
the
copious
side
discussions
on
the
causes
of
failure
in
literary
adventure
and
we
have
a
vivid
and
readable
illustration
of
ideas
which
the
author
subsequently
developed
in
his
review
articles
on
the
principles
of
success
in
literature
from
this
point
of
view
the
book
is

language
to
learn
it
has
in
its
construction
and
pronunciation
an
encouraging
directness
very
unlike
the
grammatical
involutions
of
german
and
the
delicate
of
french
working
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
almost
any
a
diligent
student
can
in
a
very
little
while
acquire
a
fair
mastery
of
the

it
is

the

comprehends
a
collection
of
anecdotes
arranged
in
short
lines
with
an
english
translation
similarly
arranged
on
the
corresponding
opposite
page
familiar
phrases
with
idiomatic
renderings
in
english
in
parallel
columns
a
vocabulary
of
words
in
common
use
and
a
complete
list
of
the
spanish
irregular
verbs
it
will
be
observed
that
this
method
hardly
can
be
called
original
that
it
is
more
or
less
that
of
morales
of
velazquez
of
prendergast
and
that
some
of
its
features
are
found
in
ollendorff
and
in
ahn
but
in
simplicity
of
arrangement
and
directness
of
purpose
it
is
superior
to
all
of
these
prendergast
possibly
excepted
it
certainly
is
what
it
is
called
a
practical
method
for
learning
spanish
with
a
relatively
small
outlay
of
mental
exertion
it
produces
exceptionally
good
results
