me
i
said
but
i
think
i
can
see
a
way
out
of
your
difficulty
a
most
urbane
and
obliging
continental
gentleman
persons
of
miladi
temperament
are
always
young
that

man
muttered
i
put
her
hand
back
firmly
he
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
us
harold
you
viper
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
avoid
me
circumstances
alter
cases
he
murmured
miss
cayley
he
said
you
are
playing
with
me
i
rose
of
a
sudden
and
ran
down
the
hill
i
was
going
to
oppose
you
and
harold
he
kept
close
at
my
heels
i
was
pulled
up
short
by
a
mounted
policeman

his
open
admiration

getting
quite
embarrassing
minute
inspection
i
felt
a
perfect
little
hypocrite
she
invited
elsie
and
myself
to
stop
with
her
the
count
i
thought
it
kinder
to
him
to
remove
it
altogether
inch
by
inch
he
retreated
never
leave
a
house
to
the
servants
my
dear
i
may
stay
may
i
i
advanced
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
i
gripped
the
rope
and
let
myself
down
i
rolled
and
slid
down

you

the
the
urbane
old
gentleman
he
went
on
dictating
for
just
an
hour
he
bowed
to
us
each
separately
i
waited
breathless
what
you
here
he
cried
he

macloghlen
he
answered

much

not
greatly
differ
from
her
agitation
was
evident
crouching
by
the
rocks
sat
our
mysterious
stranger
an
young
man
he
turned
to
me
with
an
inane
smile
nothing
seemed
to
put
the
man
down
yah
do
catch
me
going
so
fah
from
newmarket
was
fra
diavolo
also
a
composah
take
my
word
for
it
you
staking
your
money
on
the
wrong
fellah
i
am
the
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
who
your
black
friend
a
is
not
a
thing
to
be
got
up
lightly
it
went
off
unexpectedly
i
saw
him
now
the
oriental
despot
it
i
who
am
the
winnah
he
wrote
i
expect
you
to
come
back
to
england
and
marry
me
it
was
endlessly
wearisome
the
begged
him
to
be
very
careful
i
was
a
grotesque
failure
the
jury
smiled
the
question
requires
no
answer
he
said
i
reeled
where
i
sat
the
messenger
entered
he
took
a
long
careless
stare
at
me
i
beckoned
a
porter
you
ca
get
out
here
he
said
crustily
we
told
our
tale
i
have
found
a
clue
i
held
the
fort
by
main
force
never
he
answered
never
we
shall
have
him
in
our
power
victory
you
wished
to
see
me
sir
well
this
is
a
fair
he
ejaculated
harold
your
wife
has
bested
me
i
the
adventure
of
the
cantankerous
old
lady
on
the
day
when
i
found
myself
with
twopence
in
my
pocket
i
naturally
made
up
my
mind
to
go
round
the
world
it
was
my
stepfather
death
that
drove
me
to
it
i
had
never
seen
my
stepfather
indeed
i
never
even
thought
of
him
as
anything
more
than
colonel
i
owed
him
nothing
except
my
poverty
he
married
my
dear
mother
when
i
was
a
girl
at
school
in
switzerland
and
he
proceeded
to
spend
her
little
fortune
left
at
her
sole
disposal
by
my
father
will
in
paying
his
gambling
debts
after
that
he
carried
my
dear
mother
off
to
burma
and
when
he
and
the
climate
between
them
had
succeeded
in
killing
her
he
made
up
for
his
appropriations
at
the
cheapest
rate
by
allowing
me
just
enough
to
send
me
to
girton
so
when
the
colonel
died
in
the
year
i
was
leaving
college
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
into
mourning
for
him
especially
as
he
chose
the
precise
moment
when
my
allowance
was
due
and
bequeathed
me
nothing
but
his
consolidated
liabilities
course
you
will
teach
said
elsie
petheridge
when
i
explained
my
affairs
to
her
is
a
good
demand
just
now
for
teachers
i
looked
at
her
aghast
elsie
i
cried
i
had
come
up
to
town
to
settle
her
in
at
her
unfurnished
lodgings
you
say
that
just
like
you
dear
good
schoolmistresses
you
go
to
cambridge
and
get
examined
till
the
heart
and
life
have
been
examined
out
of
you
then
you
say
to
yourselves
at
the
end
of
it
all
let
me
see
what
am
i
good
for
now
i
just
about
fit
to
go
away
and
examine
other
people
that
what
our
principal
would
call
a
vicious
circle
if
one
could
ever
admit
there
was
anything
vicious
at
all
about
dear
no
elsie
i
do
propose
to
teach
nature
did
not
cut
me
out
for
a
teacher
i
could
swallow
a
poker
if
i
tried
for
weeks
pokers
do
agree
with
me
between
ourselves
i
am
a
bit
of
a
rebel
are
brownie
she
answered
pausing
in
her
papering
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
they
called
me
partly
because
of
my
dark
complexion
but
partly
because
they
could
never
understand
me
all
knew
that
long
ago
i
laid
down
the
and
mused
you
remember
elsie
i
said
staring
hard
at
the
when
i
first
went
to
girton
how
all
you
girls
wore
your
hair
quite
straight
in
neat
smooth
coils
plaited
up
at
the
back
about
the
size
of
a
pancake
and
how
of
a
sudden
i
burst
in
upon
you
like
a
tropical
hurricane
and
demoralised
you
and
how
after
three
days
of
me
some
of
the
dear
innocents
began
with
awe
to
cut
themselves
artless
fringes
while
others
went
out
in
fear
and
trembling
and
surreptitiously
purchased
a
pair
of
i
was
a
in
your
midst
in
those
days
why
you
yourself
were
almost
afraid
at
first
to
speak
to
me
see
you
had
a
bicycle
elsie
put
in
smoothing
the
wall
in
those
days
of
course
ladies
did
bicycle
you
must
admit
brownie
dear
it
a
startling
innovation
you
terrified
us
so
and
yet
after
all
there
is
much
harm
in
you
hope
not
i
said
devoutly
was
before
my
time
that
was
all
at
present
even
a
curate
wife
may
blamelessly
bicycle
if
you
do
teach
elsie
went
on
gazing
at
me
with
those
wondering
big
blue
eyes
of
hers
will
you
do
brownie
her
horizon
was
bounded
by
the
scholastic
circle
have
the
faintest
idea
i
answered
continuing
to
paste
as
i
ca
trespass
upon
your
elegant
hospitality
for
life
whatever
i
mean
to
do
i
must
begin
doing
this
morning
when
we
finished
the
papering
i
could
teach
teaching
like
mauve
is
the
refuge
of
the
incompetent
i
do
if
possible
want
to
sell
bonnets
a
milliner
girl
elsie
asked
with
a
face
of
red
horror
a
milliner
girl
why
not
is
an
honest
calling
earls
daughters
do
it
now
but
you
need
look
so
shocked
i
tell
you
just
at
present
i
am
not
contemplating
it
what
you
contemplate
i
paused
and
reflected
am
here
in
london
i
answered
gazing
rapt
at
the
ceiling
whose
streets
are
paved
with
gold
though
it
at
first
sight
like
muddy
flagstones
london
the
greatest
and
richest
city
in
the
world
where
an
adventurous
soul
ought
surely
to
find
some
loophole
for
an
adventure
that
piece
is
hung
crooked
dear
we
shall
have
to
take
it
down
again
i
devise
a
plan
therefore
i
submit
myself
to
fate
or
if
you
prefer
it
i
leave
my
future
in
the
hands
of
providence
i
shall
stroll
out
this
morning
as
soon
as
cleaned
myself
and
embrace
the
first
stray
enterprise
that
offers
our
bagdad
teems
with
enchanted
carpets
let
one
but
float
my
way
and
hi
presto
i
seize
it
i
go
where
glory
or
a
modest
competence
waits
me
i
snatch
at
the
first
offer
the
first
hint
of
an
opening
elsie
stared
at
me
more
aghast
and
more
puzzled
than
ever
how
she
asked
when
you
so
strange
what
will
you
do
to
find
one
on
my
hat
and
walk
out
i
answered
could
be
simpler
this
city
bursts
with
enterprises
and
surprises
strangers
from
east
and
west
hurry
through
it
in
all
directions
omnibuses
traverse
it
from
end
to
end
even
i
am
told
to
islington
and
putney
within
folk
sit
face
to
face
who
never
saw
one
another
before
in
their
lives
and
who
may
never
see
one
another
again
or
on
the
contrary
may
pass
the
rest
of
their
days
together
i
had
a
lovely
harangue
all
pat
in
my
head
in
much
the
same
strain
on
the
infinite
possibilities
of
entertaining
angels
unawares
in
cabs
on
the
underground
in
the
aÃ«rated
bread
shops
but
elsie
widening
eyes
of
horror
pulled
me
up
short
like
a
hansom
in
piccadilly
when
the
inexorable
upturned
hand
of
the
policeman
checks
it
brownie
she
cried
drawing
back
mean
to
tell
me
you
going
to
ask
the
first
young
man
you
meet
in
an
omnibus
to
marry
you
illustration
i
am
going
out
simply
in
search
of
adventure
i
shrieked
with
laughter
i
cried
kissing
her
dear
yellow
little
head
are
you
never
will
learn
what
i
mean
you
do
understand
the
language
no
no
i
am
going
out
simply
in
search
of
adventure
what
adventure
may
come
i
have
not
at
this
moment
the
faintest
conception
the
fun
lies
in
the
search
the
uncertainty
the
of
it
what
is
the
good
of
being
penniless
with
the
trifling
exception
of
twopence
unless
you
are
prepared
to
accept
your
position
in
the
spirit
of
a
masked
ball
at
covent
garden
have
never
been
to
one
elsie
put
in
heavens
neither
have
i
what
on
earth
do
you
take
me
for
but
i
mean
to
see
where
fate
will
lead
me
may
go
with
you
elsie
pleaded
my
child
i
answered
she
was
three
years
older
than
i
so
i
had
the
right
to
patronise
her
would
spoil
all
your
dear
little
face
would
be
quite
enough
to
scare
away
a
timid
adventure
she
knew
what
i
meant
it
was
gentle
and
pensive
but
it
lacked
initiative
so
when
we
had
finished
that
wall
i
popped
on
my
best
hat
and
popped
out
by
myself
into
kensington
gardens
i
am
told
i
ought
to
have
been
terribly
alarmed
at
the
straits
in
which
i
found
myself
a
girl
of
alone
in
the
world
and
only
twopence
short
of
penniless
without
a
friend
to
protect
a
relation
to
counsel
her
i
do
count
aunt
susan
who
lurked
in
ladylike
indigence
at
blackheath
and
whose
counsel
like
her
tracts
was
given
away
too
profusely
to
everybody
to
allow
of
one
placing
any
very
high
value
upon
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
must
admit
i
was
not
in
the
least
alarmed
nature
had
endowed
me
with
a
profusion
of
crisp
black
hair
and
plenty
of
high
spirits
if
my
eyes
had
been
like
elsie
that
liquid
blue
which
looks
out
upon
life
with
mingled
pity
and
amazement
i
might
have
felt
as
a
girl
ought
to
feel
under
such
conditions
but
having
large
dark
eyes
with
a
bit
of
a
twinkle
in
them
and
being
as
well
able
to
pilot
a
bicycle
as
any
girl
of
my
acquaintance
i
have
inherited
or
acquired
an
outlook
on
the
world
which
distinctly
leans
rather
towards
cheeriness
than
despondency
i
croak
with
difficulty
so
i
accepted
my
plight
as
an
amusing
experience
affording
full
scope
for
the
congenial
exercise
of
courage
and
ingenuity
how
boundless
are
the
opportunities
of
kensington
gardens
the
round
pond
the
winding
serpentine
the
mysterious
seclusion
of
the
dutch
brick
palace
genii
swarm
there
one
jostles
possibilities
it
is
a
land
of
romance
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
abyss
of
bayswater
and
on
the
south
by
the
amphitheatre
of
the
albert
hall
but
for
a
centre
of
adventure
i
choose
the
long
walk
it
beckoned
me
somewhat
as
the
passage
beckoned
my
seafaring
ancestors
the
buccaneering
mariners
of
elizabethan
devon
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
an
old
elm
with
a
poetic
hollow
prosaically
filled
by
a
utilitarian
plate
of
galvanised
iron
two
ancient
ladies
were
seated
on
the
other
side
already
very
dames
with
the
haughty
and
exclusive
ugliness
of
the
english
aristocracy
in
its
later
stages
for
frank
hideousness
commend
me
to
the
noble
dowager
they
were
talking
confidentially
as
i
sat
down
the
trifling
episode
of
my
approach
did
not
suffice
to
stem
the
full
stream
of
their
conversation
the
great
ignore
the
intrusion
of
their
inferiors
illustration
oui
madame
merci
beaucoup
madame
it
a
terrible
nuisance
the
eldest
and
ugliest
of
the
two
observed
she
was
a
lady
with
a
distinctly
cantankerous
cast
of
countenance
she
had
a
roman
nose
and
her
skin
was
wrinkled
like
a
wilted
apple
she
wore
in
her
bonnet
with
a
complexion
to
match
what
could
i
do
my
dear
i
simply
put
up
with
such
insolence
so
i
looked
her
straight
back
in
the
face
oh
she
quailed
i
can
tell
you
and
i
said
to
her
in
my
iciest
voice
you
know
how
icy
i
can
be
when
occasion
demands
it
the
second
old
lady
nodded
an
ungrudging
assent
as
if
perfectly
prepared
to
admit
her
friend
rare
gift
of
iciness
said
to
her
cÃ©lestine
you
can
take
your
month
wages
and
half
an
hour
to
get
out
of
this
house
and
she
dropped
me
a
deep
reverence
and
she
answered
madame
merci
beaucoup
madame
je
ne
desire
pas
mieux
and
out
she
flounced
so
there
was
the
end
of
it
you
go
to
schlangenbad
on
monday
the
point
on
monday
if
it
were
for
the
journey
i
should
have
been
glad
enough
to
be
rid
of
the
minx
i
glad
as
it
is
indeed
for
a
more
insolent
upstanding
independent
young
woman
with
a
sneer
of
her
own
never
saw
amelia
but
i
get
to
schlangenbad
now
there
the
difficulty
comes
in
on
the
one
hand
if
i
engage
a
maid
in
london
i
have
the
choice
of
two
evils
either
i
must
take
a
trapesing
english
girl
and
i
know
by
experience
that
an
english
girl
on
the
continent
is
a
vast
deal
worse
than
no
maid
at
all
have
to
wait
upon
instead
of
her
waiting
upon
you
she
gets
seasick
on
the
crossing
and
when
she
reaches
france
or
germany
she
hates
the
meals
and
she
detests
the
hotel
servants
and
she
ca
speak
the
language
so
that
she
always
calling
you
in
to
interpret
for
her
in
her
private
differences
with
the
and
the
landlord
or
else
i
must
pick
up
a
french
maid
in
london
and
i
know
equally
by
experience
that
the
french
maids
one
engages
in
london
are
invariably
dishonest
more
dishonest
than
the
rest
even
come
here
because
they
have
no
character
to
speak
of
elsewhere
and
they
think
you
are
likely
to
write
and
enquire
of
their
last
mistress
in
toulouse
or
petersburg
then
again
on
the
other
hand
i
ca
wait
to
get
a
gretchen
an
unsophisticated
little
gretchen
of
the
taunus
at
schlangenbad
i
suppose
there
unsophisticated
girls
in
germany
still
made
in
germany
they
do
make
any
longer
in
england
sure
like
everything
else
the
trade
in
rustic
innocence
has
been
driven
from
the
country
i
ca
wait
to
get
a
gretchen
as
i
should
like
to
do
of
course
because
i
simply
undertake
to
cross
the
channel
alone
and
go
all
that
long
journey
by
ostend
or
calais
brussels
and
cologne
to
schlangenbad
could
get
a
temporary
maid
her
friend
suggested
in
a
lull
of
the
tornado
the
cantankerous
old
lady
flared
up
and
have
my
stolen
or
find
she
was
an
english
girl
without
one
word
of
german
or
nurse
her
on
the
boat
when
i
want
to
give
my
undivided
attention
to
my
own
misfortunes
no
amelia
i
call
it
positively
unkind
of
you
to
suggest
such
a
thing
you
unsympathetic
i
put
my
foot
down
there
i
will
take
any
temporary
person
i
saw
my
chance
this
was
a
delightful
idea
why
not
start
for
schlangenbad
with
the
cantankerous
old
lady
of
course
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
taking
a
place
for
a
permanency
nor
even
if
it
comes
to
that
as
a
passing
expedient
but
i
wanted
to
go
round
the
world
how
could
i
do
better
than
set
out
by
the
rhine
country
the
rhine
leads
you
on
to
the
danube
the
danube
to
the
black
sea
the
black
sea
to
asia
and
so
by
way
of
india
china
and
japan
you
reach
the
pacific
and
san
francisco
whence
one
returns
quite
easily
by
new
york
and
the
white
star
liners
i
began
to
feel
like
a
already
the
cantankerous
old
lady
was
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
the
first
rung
of
the
ladder
i
proceeded
to
put
my
foot
on
it
illustration
excuse
me
i
said
but
i
think
i
see
a
way
out
of
your
difficulty
i
leaned
around
the
corner
of
the
tree
and
spoke
me
i
said
in
my
suavest
voice
i
think
i
see
a
way
out
of
your
difficulty
my
first
impression
was
that
the
cantankerous
old
lady
would
go
off
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
she
grew
purple
in
the
face
with
indignation
and
astonishment
that
a
casual
outsider
should
venture
to
address
her
so
much
so
indeed
that
for
a
second
i
almost
regretted
my
interposition
then
she
scanned
me
up
and
down
as
if
i
were
a
girl
in
a
mantle
shop
and
she
contemplated
buying
either
me
or
the
mantle
at
last
catching
my
eye
she
thought
better
of
it
and
burst
out
laughing
do
you
mean
by
this
eavesdropping
she
asked
i
flushed
up
in
turn
is
a
public
place
i
replied
with
dignity
you
spoke
in
a
tone
which
was
hardly
designed
for
the
strictest
privacy
if
you
do
wish
to
be
overheard
you
ought
to
shout
besides
i
desired
to
do
you
a
service
the
cantankerous
old
lady
regarded
me
once
more
from
head
to
foot
i
did
not
quail
then
she
turned
to
her
companion
girl
has
spirit
she
remarked
in
an
encouraging
tone
as
if
she
were
discussing
some
absent
person
my
word
amelia
i
rather
like
the
look
of
her
well
my
good
woman
what
do
you
want
to
suggest
to
me
this
i
replied
bridling
up
and
crushing
her
am
a
girton
girl
an
officer
daughter
no
more
a
good
woman
than
most
others
of
my
class
and
i
have
nothing
in
particular
to
do
for
the
moment
i
object
to
going
to
schlangenbad
i
would
convoy
you
over
as
companion
or
or
anything
else
you
choose
to
call
it
i
would
remain
with
you
there
for
a
week
till
you
could
arrange
with
your
gretchen
presumably
unsophisticated
and
then
i
would
leave
you
salary
is
unimportant
my
fare
suffices
i
accept
the
chance
as
a
cheap
opportunity
of
attaining
schlangenbad
the
old
lady
put
up
her
eyeglasses
and
inspected
me
all
over
again
i
declare
she
murmured
are
girls
coming
to
i
wonder
girton
you
say
girton
that
place
at
cambridge
you
speak
greek
of
course
but
how
about
german
a
native
i
answered
with
cheerful
promptitude
was
at
school
in
canton
berne
it
is
a
mother
tongue
to
me
no
the
old
lady
went
on
fixing
her
keen
small
eyes
on
my
mouth
little
lips
could
never
frame
themselves
to
schlecht
or
wunderschÃ¶n
they
were
not
cut
out
for
it
me
i
answered
in
german
i
say
that
i
mean
the
music
of
the
has
on
my
infant
ear
from
the
impressed
itself
the
old
lady
laughed
aloud
jabber
it
to
me
child
she
cried
hate
the
lingo
it
the
one
tongue
on
earth
that
even
a
pretty
girl
lips
fail
to
render
attractive
you
yourself
make
faces
over
it
what
your
name
young
woman
cayley
a
name
i
never
heard
of
any
lois
in
my
life
before
except
timothy
grandmother
not
anybody
grandmother
are
you
to
my
knowledge
i
answered
gravely
she
burst
out
laughing
again
you
do
i
think
she
said
catching
my
arm
big
mill
down
yonder
has
ground
the
originality
altogether
out
of
you
i
adore
originality
it
was
clever
of
you
to
catch
at
the
suggestion
of
this
arrangement
lois
cayley
you
say
any
relation
of
a
madcap
captain
cayley
whom
i
used
once
to
know
in
the
highlanders
daughter
i
answered
flushing
for
i
was
proud
of
my
father
i
remember
he
died
poor
fellow
he
was
a
good
soldier
and
his
i
felt
she
was
going
to
say
fool
of
a
widow
but
a
glance
from
me
quelled
her
widow
went
and
married
that
scapegrace
jack
never
marry
a
man
my
dear
with
a
name
and
no
visible
means
of
subsistence
above
all
if
he
generally
known
by
a
nickname
so
you
poor
tom
daughter
are
you
well
well
we
can
settle
this
little
matter
between
us
mind
i
a
person
who
always
expects
to
have
my
own
way
if
you
come
with
to
schlangenbad
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
i
could
manage
it
for
a
week
i
answered
demurely
she
smiled
at
my
audacity
we
passed
on
to
terms
they
were
quite
satisfactory
she
wanted
no
references
i
look
like
a
woman
who
cares
about
a
reference
what
are
called
are
usually
essays
in
how
not
to
say
it
you
take
my
fancy
that
the
point
and
poor
tom
cayley
but
mind
i
will
be
contradicted
will
not
contradict
your
wildest
misstatement
i
answered
smiling
your
name
and
address
i
asked
after
we
had
settled
preliminaries
a
faint
red
spot
rose
quaintly
in
the
centre
of
the
cantankerous
old
lady
sallow
cheek
dear
she
murmured
name
is
the
one
thing
on
earth
i
really
ashamed
of
my
parents
chose
to
inflict
upon
me
the
most
odious
label
that
human
ingenuity
ever
devised
for
a
christian
soul
and
i
not
had
courage
enough
to
burst
out
and
change
it
a
gleam
of
intuition
flashed
across
me
do
mean
to
say
i
exclaimed
you
called
georgina
the
cantankerous
old
lady
gripped
my
arm
hard
an
unusually
intelligent
girl
she
broke
in
on
earth
did
you
guess
it
georgina
i
answered
is
mine
georgina
lois
but
as
i
quite
agree
with
you
as
to
the
atrocity
of
such
conduct
i
have
suppressed
the
georgina
it
ought
to
be
made
penal
to
send
innocent
girls
into
the
world
so
burdened

a
t

exceptionally
sensible

thanks
and
strolled
back

bread

last

cut
out
half
her
clothes
for
her
her
own
ideas
were
almost
entirely
limited
to
differential
calculus
and
cutting
out
a
blouse
by
differential
calculus
is
weary
uphill
work
for
a
teacher
by
monday
i
had
papered
and
furnished
the
rooms
and
was
ready
to
start
on
my
voyage
of
exploration
i
met
the
cantankerous
old
lady
at
charing
cross
by
appointment
and
proceeded
to
take
charge
of
her
luggage
and
tickets
oh
my
how
fussy
she
was
will
drop
that
basket
i
hope
you
have
got
through
tickets
malines
by
brussels
i
wo
go
by
brussels
you
have
to
change
there
now
mind
you
notice
how
much
the
luggage
weighs
in
english
pounds
and
make
the
man
at
the
office
give
you
a
note
of
it
to
check
those
horrid
belgian
porters
they
charge
you
for
double
the
weight
unless
you
reduce
it
at
once
to
kilogrammes
know
their
ways
foreigners
have
no
consciences
they
just
go
to
the
priest
and
confess
you
know
and
wipe
it
all
out
and
start
fresh
again
on
a
career
of
crime
next
morning
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
go
abroad
the
only
country
in
the
world
fit
to
live
in
is
england
no
mosquitoes
no
passports
no
goodness
gracious
child
do
let
that
odious
man
bang
about
my
have
you
no
immortal
soul
porter
that
you
crush
other
people
property
as
if
it
was
blackbeetles
no
i
will
not
let
you
take
this
lois
this
is
my
it
contains
all
that
remains
of
the
fawley
family
jewels
i
positively
decline
to
appear
at
schlangenbad
without
a
diamond
to
my
back
this
never
leaves
my
hands
it
hard
enough
nowadays
to
keep
body
and
skirt
together
you
secured
that
at
ostend
illustration
a
most
urbane
and
obliging
continental
gentleman
we
got
into
our
carriage
it
was
clean
and
comfortable
but
the
cantankerous
old
lady
made
the
porter
mop
the
floor
and
fidgeted
and
worried
till
we
slid
out
of
the
station
fortunately
the
only
other
occupant
of
the
compartment
was
a
most
urbane
and
obliging
continental
gentleman
i
say
continental
because
i
could
quite
make
out
whether
he
was
french
german
or
austrian
who
was
anxious
in
every
way
to
meet
lady
georgina
wishes
did
madame
desire
to
have
the
window
open
oh
certainly
with
pleasure
the
day
was
so
sultry
closed
a
little
more
there
a
current
of
air
faut
madame
would
prefer
the
corner
no
then
perhaps
she
would
like
this
valise
for
a
footstool
just
thus
a
cold
draught
runs
so
often
along
the
floor
in
railway
carriages
this
is
kent
that
we
traverse
ah
the
garden
of
england
as
a
diplomat
he
knew
every
nook
of
europe
and
he
echoed
the
he
had
accidentally
heard
drop
from
madame
lips
on
the
platform
no
country
in
the
world
so
delightful
as
england
is
attached
to
the
embassy
in
london
lady
georgina
inquired
growing
affable
he
twirled
his
grey
moustache
a
waxed
moustache
of
great
distinction
madame
i
have
quitted
the
diplomatic
service
i
inhabit
london
now
mon
some
of
my
compatriots
call
it
for
me
i
find
it
the
most
fascinating
capital
in
europe
what
gaiety
what
movement
what
poetry
what
mystery
mystery
means
fog
it
challenges
the
world
i
interposed
he
gazed
at
me
with
fixed
eyes
mademoiselle
he
answered
in
quite
a
different
and
markedly
chilly
voice
your
great
country
attempts
were
it
only
a
fog
it
achieves
consummately
i
have
quick
intuitions
i
felt
the
foreign
gentleman
took
an
instinctive
dislike
to
me
to
make
up
for
it
he
talked
much
and
with
animation
to
lady
georgina
they
ferreted
out
friends
in
common
and
were
as
much
surprised
at
it
as
people
always
are
at
that
inevitable
experience
yes
madame
i
recollect
him
well
in
vienna
i
was
there
at
the
time
attached
to
our
legation
he
was
a
charming
man
you
read
his
masterly
paper
on
the
central
problem
of
the
dual
empire
were
in
vienna
then
the
cantankerous
old
lady
mused
back
my
child
do
stare
she
had
covenanted
from
the
first
to
call
me
lois
as
my
father
daughter
and
i
confess
i
preferred
it
to
being
miss
cayley
must
surely
have
met
dare
i
ask
your
name
monsieur
i
could
see
the
foreign
gentleman
was
delighted
at
this
turn
he
had
played
for
it
and
carried
his
point
he
meant
her
to
ask
him
he
had
a
card
in
his
pocket
conveniently
close
and
he
handed
it
across
to
her
she
read
it
and
passed
it
on
le
comte
de
i
remember
your
name
well
the
cantankerous
old
lady
broke
in
think
you
knew
my
husband
sir
evelyn
fawley
and
my
father
lord
kynaston
the
count
looked
profoundly
surprised
and
delighted
you
are
then
lady
georgina
fawley
he
cried
striking
an
attitude
miladi
your
admirable
husband
was
one
of
the
very
first
to
exert
his
influence
in
my
favour
at
vienna
do
i
recall
him
sir
evelyn
if
i
recall
him
what
a
fortunate
rencounter
i
must
have
seen
you
some
years
ago
at
vienna
miladi
though
i
had
not
then
the
great
pleasure
of
making
your
acquaintance
but
your
face
had
impressed
itself
on
my
self
i
did
not
learn
till
later
that
the
esoteric
doctrine
of
the
self
was
lady
georgina
favourite
hobby
moment
chance
led
me
to
this
carriage
this
morning
i
said
to
myself
that
face
those
features
so
vivid
so
striking
i
have
seen
them
somewhere
with
what
do
i
connect
them
in
the
recesses
of
my
memory
a
family
genius
rank
the
diplomatic
service
some
unnameable
charm
some
faint
touch
of
eccentricity
ha
i
have
it
vienna
a
carriage
with
footmen
in
red
livery
a
noble
presence
a
crowd
of
wits
poets
artists
politicians
pressing
eagerly
round
the
landau
that
was
my
mental
picture
as
i
sat
and
confronted
you
i
understand
it
all
now
this
is
lady
georgina
fawley
i
thought
the
cantankerous
old
lady
who
was
a
shrewd
person
in
her
way
must
surely
see
through
this
obvious
patter
but
i
had
the
average
human
capacity
for
swallowing
flattery
instead
of
dismissing
his
fulsome
nonsense
with
a
contemptuous
smile
lady
georgina
perked
herself
up
with
a
conscious
air
of
coquetry
and
asked
for
more
they
were
delightful
days
in
vienna
she
said
simpering
was
young
then
count
i
enjoyed
life
with
a
zest
illustration
persons
of
miladi
temperament
are
always
young
of
miladi
temperament
are
always
young
the
count
retorted
glibly
leaning
forward
and
gazing
at
her
old
is
a
foolish
habit
of
the
stupid
and
the
vacant
men
and
women
of
are
never
older
one
learns
as
one
goes
on
in
life
to
admire
not
the
obvious
beauty
of
mere
youth
and
health
he
glanced
across
at
me
disdainfully
the
profounder
beauty
of
deep
character
in
a
face
that
calm
and
serene
beauty
which
is
imprinted
on
the
brow
by
experience
of
the
emotions
have
had
my
moments
lady
georgina
murmured
with
her
head
on
one
side
believe
it
miladi
the
count
answered
and
ogled
her
thenceforward
to
dover
they
talked
together
with
ceaseless
animation
the
cantankerous
old
lady
was
capital
company
she
had
a
tang
in
her
tongue
and
in
the
course
of
ninety
minutes
she
had
flayed
alive
the
greater
part
of
london
society
with
keen
wit
and
sprightliness
i
laughed
against
my
will
at
her
sallies
they
were
too
funny
not
to
amuse
in
spite
of
their
vitriol
as
for
the
count
he
was
charmed
he
talked
well
himself
too
and
between
them
i
almost
forgot
the
time
till
we
arrived
at
dover
it
was
a
very
rough
passage
the
count
helped
us
to
carry
our
nineteen
and
four
rugs
on
board
but
i
noticed
that
fascinated
as
she
was
with
him
lady
georgina
resisted
his
ingenious
efforts
to
gain
possession
of
her
precious
as
she
descended
the
gangway
she
clung
to
it
like
grim
death
even
in
the
chops
of
the
channel
fortunately
i
am
a
good
sailor
and
when
lady
georgina
sallow
cheeks
began
to
grow
pale
i
was
steady
enough
to
supply
her
with
her
shawl
and
her
she
fidgeted
and
worried
the
whole
way
over
she
be
treated
like
a
vertebrate
animal
those
horrid
belgians
had
no
right
to
stick
their
just
in
front
of
her
the
impertinence
of
the
hussies
with
the
bright
red
hair
a
daughters
she
felt
sure
in
venturing
to
come
and
sit
on
the
same
bench
with
the
bench
ladies
only
under
the
lee
of
the
funnel
only
indeed
did
the
baggages
pretend
they
considered
themselves
ladies
oh
that
placid
old
gentleman
in
the
episcopal
gaiters
was
their
father
was
he
well
a
bishop
should
bring
up
his
daughters
better
having
his
children
in
subjection
with
all
gravity
instead
of
which
my
this
was
a
beastly
boat
such
an
odour
of
machinery
they
had
no
decent
boats
nowadays
with
all
our
boasted
improvements
she
could
remember
well
when
the
service
was
much
better
conducted
than
it
was
at
present
but
was
before
we
had
compulsory
education
the
working
classes
were
driving
trade
out
of
the
country
and
the
consequence
was
we
could
build
a
boat
which
did
reek
like
an
even
the
sailors
on
board
were
french
jabbering
idiots
not
an
honest
british
among
the
lot
of
them
though
the
stewards
were
english
and
very
inferior
cockney
english
at
that
with
their
ways
and
their
school
board
airs
and
graces
school
board
them
if
they
were
her
servants
show
them
the
sort
of
respect
that
was
due
to
people
of
birth
and
education
but
the
children
of
the
lower
classes
never
learnt
their
catechism
nowadays
they
were
too
much
occupied
with
literatoor
jography
and
drawrin
happily
for
my
nerves
a
good
lurch
to
leeward
put
a
stop
for
a
while
to
the
course
of
her
thoughts
on
the
present
distresses
at
ostend
the
count
made
a
second
gallant
attempt
to
capture
the
which
lady
georgina
automatically
repulsed
she
had
a
fixed
habit
i
believe
of
sticking
fast
to
that
for
she
was
too
overpowered
by
the
count
urbanity
i
feel
sure
to
suspect
for
a
moment
his
honesty
of
purpose
but
whenever
she
travelled
i
fancy
she
clung
to
her
case
as
if
her
life
depended
upon
it
it
contained
the
whole
of
her
valuable
diamonds
we
had
twenty
minutes
for
refreshments
at
ostend
during
which
interval
my
old
lady
declared
with
warmth
that
i
look
after
her
registered
luggage
though
as
it
was
booked
through
to
cologne
i
could
not
even
see
it
till
we
crossed
the
german
frontier
for
the
belgian
seal
up
the
van
as
soon
as
the
through
baggage
for
germany
is
unloaded
to
satisfy
her
however
i
went
through
the
formality
of
pretending
to
inspect
it
and
rendered
myself
hateful
to
the
head
of
the
by
asking
various
foolish
and
inept
questions
on
which
lady
georgina
insisted
when
i
had
finished
this
silly
and
uncongenial
task
for
i
am
not
by
nature
fussy
and
it
is
hard
to
assume
fussiness
as
another
person
proxy
i
returned
to
our
which
i
had
arranged
for
in
london
to
my
great
amazement
i
found
the
cantankerous
old
lady
and
the
egregious
count
comfortably
seated
there
has
been
good
enough
to
accept
a
place
in
our
carriage
she
observed
as
i
entered
he
bowed
and
smiled
rather
madame
has
been
so
kind
as
to
offer
me
one
he
corrected
you
like
some
lunch
lady
georgina
i
asked
in
my
chilliest
voice
are
ten
minutes
to
spare
and
the
is
excellent
admirable
inspiration
the
count
murmured
me
to
escort
you
miladi
will
come
lois
lady
georgina
asked
thank
you
i
answered
for
i
had
an
idea
am
a
capital
sailor
but
the
sea
takes
away
my
appetite
you
keep
our
places
she
said
turning
to
me
hope
you
wo
allow
them
to
stick
in
any
horrid
foreigners
they
will
try
to
force
them
on
you
unless
you
insist
know
their
tricky
ways
you
have
the
tickets
i
trust
and
the
for
the
well
mind
you
do
lose
the
paper
for
the
registered
luggage
do
let
those
dreadful
porters
touch
my
cloaks
and
if
anybody
attempts
to
get
in
be
sure
you
stand
in
front
of
the
door
as
they
mount
to
prevent
them
the
count
handed
her
out
he
was
all
high
courtly
politeness
as
lady
georgina
descended
he
made
yet
another
dexterous
effort
to
relieve
her
of
the
i
do
think
she
noticed
it
but
automatically
once
more
she
waved
him
aside
then
she
turned
to
me
my
dear
she
said
handing
it
to
me
better
take
care
of
it
if
i
lay
it
down
in
the
while
i
am
eating
my
soup
some
rogue
may
run
away
with
it
but
mind
do
let
it
out
of
your
hands
on
any
account
hold
it
so
on
your
knee
and
for
heaven
sake
do
part
with
it
illustration
that
succeeds
the
man
muttered
by
this
time
my
suspicions
of
the
count
were
profound
from
the
first
i
had
doubted
him
he
was
so
blandly
plausible
but
as
we
landed
at
ostend
i
had
accidentally
overheard
a
low
whispered
conversation
when
he
passed
a
man
who
had
travelled
in
a
carriage
from
london
succeeds
the
man
had
muttered
under
his
breath
in
french
as
the
haughty
nobleman
with
the
waxed
moustache
brushed
by
him
succeeds
admirably
the
count
had
answered
in
the
same
soft
undertone
rÃ©ussit
Ã 
merveille
i
understood
him
to
mean
that
he
had
prospered
in
his
attempt
to
impose
on
lady
georgina
they
had
been
gone
five
minutes
at
the
when
the
count
came
back
hurriedly
to
the
door
of
the
with
a
air
mademoiselle
he
said
in
an
tone
georgina
has
sent
me
to
fetch
her
i
gripped
it
hard
with
both
hands
le
comte
i
answered
georgina
intrusted
it
to
safe
keeping
and
without
her
leave
i
can
not
give
it
up
to
any
one
mistrust
me
he
cried
looking
black
doubt
my
honour
you
doubt
my
word
when
i
say
that
miladi
has
sent
me
i
answered
calmly
i
have
lady
georgina
orders
to
stick
to
this
case
and
till
lady
georgina
returns
i
stick
to
it
he
murmured
some
indignant
remark
below
his
breath
and
walked
off
the
passenger
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform
outside
in
a
as
they
passed
their
lips
moved
the
seemed
to
mutter
un
coup
however
he
did
not
desist
even
so
i
saw
he
meant
to
go
on
with
his
dangerous
little
game
he
returned
to
the
and
rejoined
lady
georgina
i
felt
sure
it
would
be
useless
to
warn
her
so
completely
had
the
count
succeeded
in
gulling
her
but
i
took
my
own
steps
i
examined
the
closely
it
had
a
leather
outer
covering
within
was
a
strong
steel
box
with
stout
bands
of
metal
to
bind
it
i
took
my
cue
at
once
and
acted
for
the
best
on
my
own
responsibility
when
lady
georgina
and
the
count
returned
they
were
like
old
friends
together
the
quails
in
aspic
and
the
sparkling
hock
had
evidently
opened
their
hearts
to
one
another
as
far
as
malines
they
laughed
and
talked
without
ceasing
lady
georgina
was
now
in
her
finest
vein
of
spleen
her
acid
wit
grew
sharper
and
more
caustic
each
moment
not
a
reputation
in
europe
had
a
rag
left
to
cover
it
as
we
steamed
in
beneath
the
huge
iron
roof
of
the
main
central
junction
i
had
observed
all
the
way
from
ostend
that
the
count
had
been
anxious
lest
we
might
have
to
give
up
our
at
malines
i
assured
him
more
than
once
that
his
fears
were
groundless
for
i
had
arranged
at
charing
cross
that
it
should
run
right
through
to
the
german
frontier
but
he
waved
me
aside
with
one
lordly
hand
i
had
not
told
lady
georgina
of
his
vain
attempt
to
take
possession
of
her
and
the
bare
fact
of
my
silence
made
him
increasingly
suspicious
of
me
me
mademoiselle
he
said
coldly
do
not
understand
these
lines
as
well
as
i
do
nothing
is
more
common
than
for
those
rascals
of
railway
clerks
to
sell
one
a
place
in
a
or
a
and
then
never
reserve
it
or
turn
one
out
half
way
it
is
very
possible
miladi
may
have
to
descend
at
malines
lady
georgina
bore
him
out
by
a
large
variety
of
selected
stories
concerning
the
various
atrocities
of
the
rival
companies
which
had
stolen
her
luggage
on
her
way
to
italy
as
for
de
they
were
dens
of
robbers
so
when
we
reached
malines
just
to
satisfy
lady
georgina
i
put
out
my
head
and
inquired
of
a
porter
as
i
anticipated
he
replied
that
there
was
no
change
we
went
through
to
verviers
the
count
however
was
still
unsatisfied
he
descended
and
made
some
remarks
a
little
farther
down
the
platform
to
an
official
in
the
cap
of
a
or
some
such
functionary
then
he
returned
to
us
all
fuming
is
as
i
said
he
exclaimed
flinging
open
the
door
rogues
have
deceived
us
the
goes
no
farther
you
must
dismount
at
once
miladi
and
take
the
train
just
opposite
i
felt
sure
he
was
wrong
and
i
ventured
to
say
so
but
lady
georgina
cried
child
the
must
know
get
out
at
once
bring
my
bag
and
the
rugs
mind
that
cloak
do
forget
the
thanks
count
will
you
kindly
take
charge
of
my
umbrellas
hurry
up
lois
hurry
up
the
train
is
just
starting
i
scrambled
after
her
with
my
fourteen
bundles
keeping
a
quiet
eye
meanwhile
on
the
we
took
our
seats
in
the
opposite
train
which
i
noticed
was
marked
bruxelles
paris
but
i
said
nothing
the
count
jumped
in
jumped
about
arranged
our
parcels
jumped
out
again
he
spoke
to
a
porter
then
he
rushed
back
excitedly
miladi
he
cried
find
the
has
cruelly
deceived
me
you
were
right
after
all
mademoiselle
we
must
return
to
the
with
singular
magnanimity
i
refrained
from
saying
told
you
so
lady
georgina
very
flustered
and
hot
by
this
time
tumbled
out
once
more
and
bolted
back
to
the
both
trains
were
just
starting
in
her
hurry
at
last
she
let
the
count
take
possession
of
her
i
rather
fancy
that
as
he
passed
one
window
he
handed
it
in
to
the
passenger
but
i
am
not
certain
at
any
rate
when
we
were
comfortably
seated
in
our
own
compartment
once
more
and
he
stood
on
the
footboard
just
about
to
enter
of
a
sudden
he
made
an
unexpected
dash
back
and
flung
himself
wildly
into
a
paris
carriage
at
the
moment
with
a
piercing
shriek
both
trains
started
lady
georgina
threw
up
her
hands
in
a
frenzy
of
horror
diamonds
she
cried
aloud
lois
my
diamonds
distress
yourself
i
answered
holding
her
back
for
i
verily
believe
she
would
have
leapt
from
the
train
has
only
taken
the
outer
shell
with
the
inside
it
is
the
steel
box
and
i
produced
it
triumphantly
she
seized
it
overjoyed
did
this
happen
she
cried
hugging
it
for
she
loved
those
diamonds
simply
i
answered
saw
the
man
was
a
rogue
and
that
he
had
a
confederate
with
him
in
another
carriage
so
while
you
were
gone
to
the
at
ostend
i
slipped
the
box
out
of
the
case
and
put
in
the
that
he
might
carry
it
off
and
we
might
have
proofs
against
him
all
you
have
to
do
now
is
to
inform
the
conductor
who
will
telegraph
to
stop
the
train
to
paris
i
spoke
to
him
about
that
at
ostend
so
that
everything
is
ready
she
positively
hugged
me
dear
she
cried
are
the
cleverest
little
woman
i
ever
met
in
my
life
who
on
earth
could
have
suspected
such
a
polished
gentleman
why
you
worth
your
weight
in
gold
what
the
dickens
shall
i
do
without
you
at
schlangenbad
ii
the
adventure
of
the
supercilious
the
count
must
have
been
an
adept
in
the
gentle
art
of
disguise
for
though
we
telegraphed
full
particulars
of
his
appearance
from
louvain
the
next
station
nobody
in
the
least
resembling
either
him
or
his
accomplice
the
man
could
be
unearthed
in
the
paris
train
when
it
drew
up
at
brussels
its
first
they
must
have
transformed
themselves
meanwhile
into
two
different
persons
indeed
from
the
outset
i
had
suspected
his
moustache
was
so
distinguished
when
we
reached
cologne
the
cantankerous
old
lady
overwhelmed
me
with
the
warmth
of
her
thanks
and
praises
nay
more
after
breakfast
next
morning
before
we
set
out
by
slow
train
for
schlangenbad
she
burst
like
a
tornado
into
my
bedroom
at
the
cologne
hotel
with
a
cheque
for
twenty
guineas
drawn
in
my
favour
for
you
my
dear
she
said
handing
it
to
me
and
looking
really
quite
gracious
i
glanced
at
the
piece
of
paper
and
felt
my
face
glow
crimson
lady
georgina
i
cried
misunderstand
you
forget
that
i
am
a
lady
child
nonsense
your
courage
and
promptitude
were
worth
ten
times
that
sum
she
exclaimed
positively
slipping
her
arm
round
my
neck
was
your
courage
i
particularly
admired
lois
because
you
faced
the
risk
of
my
happening
to
look
inside
the
outer
case
and
finding
you
had
abstracted
the
blessed
box
in
which
case
i
might
quite
naturally
have
concluded
you
meant
to
steal
it
thought
of
that
i
answered
i
decided
to
risk
it
i
felt
it
was
worth
while
for
i
was
sure
the
man
meant
to
take
the
case
as
soon
as
ever
you
gave
him
the
opportunity
you
deserve
to
be
rewarded
she
insisted
pressing
the
cheque
upon
me
illustration
i
put
her
hand
back
firmly
i
put
her
hand
back
firmly
georgina
i
said
is
very
amiable
of
you
i
think
you
do
right
in
offering
me
the
money
but
i
think
i
should
do
altogether
wrong
in
accepting
it
a
lady
is
not
honest
from
the
hope
of
gain
she
is
not
brave
because
she
expects
to
be
paid
for
her
bravery
you
were
my
employer
and
i
was
bound
to
serve
my
employer
interests
i
did
so
as
well
as
i
could
and
there
is
the
end
of
it
she
looked
absolutely
disappointed
we
all
hate
to
crush
a
benevolent
impulse
but
she
tore
the
cheque
up
into
very
small
pieces
you
will
my
dear
she
said
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
see
you
are
poor
tom
cayley
daughter
he
was
always
a
bit
quixotic
though
i
believe
she
liked
me
all
the
better
for
my
refusal
on
the
way
from
cologne
to
eltville
however
and
on
the
drive
up
to
schlangenbad
i
found
her
just
as
fussy
and
as
worrying
as
ever
me
see
how
many
of
these
horrid
pfennigs
make
an
english
penny
i
never
remember
oh
those
silly
little
nickel
things
are
ten
pfennigs
each
are
they
well
eight
would
be
a
penny
i
suppose
a
mark
a
shilling
ridiculous
of
them
to
divide
it
into
ten
pence
instead
of
twelve
one
never
really
knows
how
much
one
paying
for
anything
why
these
continental
people
ca
be
content
to
use
pounds
shillings
and
pence
all
over
alike
the
same
as
we
do
passes
comprehension
they
glad
enough
to
get
english
sovereigns
when
they
can
why
then
do
they
use
them
as
such
instead
of
reckoning
them
each
at
francs
and
then
trying
to
cheat
you
out
of
the
proper
exchange
which
is
ten
centimes
more
than
the
brokers
give
you
what
use
their
beastly
decimal
system
lois
i
ashamed
of
you
an
english
girl
to
turn
and
rend
her
native
country
like
that
francs
and
centimes
indeed
fancy
proposing
it
at
peter
robinson
no
i
will
go
by
the
boat
my
dear
i
hate
the
rhine
boats
crowded
with
nasty
selfish
pigs
of
germans
what
like
is
a
compartment
all
to
myself
and
no
horrid
foreigners
especially
germans
they
bursting
with
have
such
an
exaggerated
belief
in
their
land
and
their
folk
and
when
they
come
to
england
they
do
nothing
but
find
fault
with
us
if
people
are
satisfied
with
the
countries
they
travel
in
they
better
stop
at
home
that
opinion
nasty
pigs
of
germans
the
very
sight
of
them
sickens
me
oh
i
do
mind
if
they
understand
me
child
they
all
learn
english
nowadays
it
helps
them
in
trade
that
why
they
driving
us
out
of
all
the
markets
but
it
be
good
for
them
to
learn
once
in
a
way
what
other
people
really
think
of
them
civilised
people
i
mean
not
germans
they
a
set
of
barbarians
we
reached
schlangenbad
alive
though
i
sometimes
doubted
it
for
my
old
lady
did
her
boisterous
best
to
rouse
some
peppery
german
officer
into
cutting
our
throats
incontinently
by
the
way
and
when
we
got
there
we
took
up
our
abode
in
the
nicest
hotel
in
the
village
lady
georgina
had
engaged
the
best
front
room
on
the
first
floor
with
a
charming
view
across
the
valley
but
i
must
do
her
the
justice
to
say
that
she
took
the
second
best
for
me
and
that
she
treated
me
in
every
way
like
the
guest
she
delighted
to
honour
my
refusal
to
accept
her
twenty
guineas
made
her
anxious
to
pay
it
back
to
me
within
the
terms
of
our
agreement
she
described
me
to
everybody
as
a
young
friend
who
was
travelling
with
her
and
never
gave
any
one
the
slightest
hint
of
my
being
a
paid
companion
our
arrangement
was
that
i
was
to
have
two
guineas
for
the
week
besides
my
travelling
expenses
board
and
lodging
on
our
first
morning
at
schlangenbad
lady
georgina
sallied
forth
very
much
overdressed
and
in
a
youthful
hat
to
use
the
waters
they
are
valued
chiefly
for
the
complexion
i
learned
i
wondered
then
why
lady
georgina
came
there
for
she
had
any
but
they
are
also
recommended
for
nervous
irritability
and
as
lady
georgina
had
visited
the
place
almost
every
summer
for
fifteen
years
it
opened
before
one
mind
an
appalling
vista
of
what
her
temper
might
have
been
if
she
had
gone
to
schlangenbad
the
hot
springs
are
used
in
the
form
of
a
bath
do
need
them
my
dear
lady
georgina
said
to
me
with
a
smile
and
i
will
own
that
i
did
not
for
nature
has
gifted
me
with
a
tolerable
cuticle
but
i
like
when
at
rome
to
do
as
rome
does
so
i
tried
the
baths
once
i
found
them
unpleasantly
smooth
and
oily
i
do
not
freckle
but
if
i
did
i
think
i
should
prefer
freckles
we
walked
much
on
the
terrace
the
inevitable
dawdling
promenade
of
all
german
it
reeked
of
serene
highness
we
also
drove
out
among
the
low
wooded
hills
which
bound
the
rhine
valley
the
majority
of
the
visitors
i
found
were
ladies
court
ladies
most
of
them
all
there
for
their
complexions
but
all
anxious
to
assure
me
privately
they
had
come
for
what
they
described
as
debility
i
divided
them
at
once
into
two
classes
half
of
them
never
had
and
never
would
have
a
complexion
at
all
the
other
half
had
exceptionally
smooth
and
beautiful
skins
of
which
they
were
obviously
proud
and
whose
they
thought
to
preserve
by
assiduous
bathing
it
was
vanity
working
on
two
opposite
bases
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
men
however
who
were
really
there
for
a
sufficient
reason
wounds
or
serious
complaints
while
a
few
good
old
sticks
porty
and
whisty
were
in
attendance
on
invalid
wives
or
sisters
illustration
he
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
us
from
the
beginning
i
noticed
that
lady
georgina
went
peering
about
all
over
the
place
as
if
she
were
hunting
for
something
she
had
lost
with
her
glasses
perpetually
in
evidence
the
outrage
i
called
them
and
that
she
eyed
all
the
men
with
peculiar
attention
but
i
took
no
open
notice
of
her
little
weakness
on
our
second
day
at
the
spa
i
was
sauntering
with
her
down
the
chief
street
beastly
little
hole
my
dear
not
a
decent
shop
where
one
can
buy
a
reel
of
thread
or
a
yard
of
tape
in
the
place
when
i
observed
a
tall
and
handsome
young
man
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
us
and
then
sneak
round
the
corner
hurriedly
he
was
a
young
man
with
large
dreamy
eyes
and
a
peculiarly
beautiful
and
gentle
expression
but
what
i
noted
about
him
most
was
an
odd
superficial
air
of
superciliousness
he
seemed
always
to
be
looking
down
with
scorn
on
that
foolish
jumble
the
universe
he
darted
away
so
rapidly
however
that
i
hardly
discovered
all
this
just
then
i
piece
it
out
from
subsequent
observations
later
in
the
day
we
chanced
to
pass
a
where
three
young
exquisites
sat
sipping
rhine
wines
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
one
of
them
with
a
cigarette
held
gracefully
between
two
slender
fingers
was
my
young
aristocrat
he
was
blowing
out
smoke
in
a
lazy
blue
stream
the
moment
he
saw
me
however
he
turned
away
as
if
he
desired
to
escape
observation
and
ducked
down
so
as
to
hide
his
face
behind
his
companions
i
wondered
why
on
earth
he
should
want
to
avoid
me
could
this
be
the
count
no
the
young
man
with
the
halo
of
cigarette
smoke
stood
three
inches
taller
who
then
at
schlangenbad
could
wish
to
avoid
my
notice
it
was
a
singular
mystery
for
i
was
quite
certain
the
supercilious
young
man
was
trying
his
best
to
prevent
my
seeing
him
that
evening
after
dinner
the
cantankerous
old
lady
burst
out
suddenly
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
why
harold
turned
up
here
the
wretch
knew
i
was
coming
and
i
heard
from
our
ambassador
at
rome
last
week
that
he
was
going
to
be
at
schlangenbad
is
harold
i
asked
nephew
lady
georgina
snapped
back
beating
a
devil
tattoo
with
her
fan
on
the
table
only
member
of
my
family
except
myself
who
is
a
born
idiot
harold
not
an
idiot
he
an
at
rome
i
saw
it
at
a
glance
he
in
schlangenbad
i
answered
noticed
him
this
morning
the
old
lady
turned
towards
me
sharply
she
peered
right
through
me
as
if
she
were
a
rÃ¶ntgen
ray
i
could
see
she
was
asking
herself
whether
this
was
a
conspiracy
and
whether
i
had
come
there
on
purpose
to
meet
but
i
flatter
myself
i
am
tolerably
mistress
of
my
own
countenance
i
did
not
blench
do
you
know
she
asked
quickly
with
an
acid
intonation
if
i
had
answered
the
truth
i
should
have
said
know
he
is
here
because
i
saw
a
young
man
evidently
trying
to
avoid
you
this
morning
and
if
a
young
man
has
the
misfortune
to
be
born
your
nephew
and
also
to
have
expectations
from
you
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
he
would
prefer
to
keep
out
of
your
way
as
long
as
possible
but
that
would
have
been
neither
polite
nor
politic
moreover
i
reflected
that
i
had
no
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
do
harold
a
bad
turn
and
that
it
would
be
kinder
to
him
as
well
as
to
her
to
conceal
the
reasons
on
which
i
based
my
instinctive
inference
so
i
took
up
a
strong
strategic
position
have
an
intuition
that
i
saw
him
in
the
village
this
morning
i
said
likeness
perhaps
i
merely
jumped
at
it
as
you
spoke
a
tall
languid
young
man
large
poetical
eyes
an
artistic
moustache
just
a
trifle
harold
the
cantankerous
old
lady
rapped
out
sharply
with
clear
conviction
miserable
boy
why
on
earth
has
he
been
round
to
see
me
i
reflected
that
i
knew
why
but
i
did
not
say
so
silence
is
golden
i
also
remarked
mentally
on
that
curious
human
blindness
which
had
made
me
conclude
at
first
that
the
supercilious
young
man
was
trying
to
avoid
when
i
might
have
guessed
it
was
far
more
likely
he
was
trying
to
avoid
my
companion
i
was
a
nobody
lady
georgina
fawley
was
a
woman
of
european
reputation
he
did
know
which
hotel
you
were
stopping
at
i
put
in
even
that
you
were
here
i
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
shield
poor
harold
know
which
hotel
nonsense
child
he
knows
i
come
here
on
this
precise
date
regularly
every
summer
and
if
he
did
know
is
it
likely
i
should
try
any
other
inn
when
this
is
the
only
moderately
decent
house
to
stop
at
in
schlangenbad
and
the
morning
coffee
undrinkable
at
that
while
the
hash
hash
but
that
the
way
in
germany
an
ungrateful
monster
if
he
comes
now
i
shall
refuse
to
see
him
illustration
harold
you
viper
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
avoid
me
next
morning
after
breakfast
however
in
spite
of
these
threats
she
hailed
me
forth
with
her
on
the
harold
hunt
she
had
sent
the
to
inquire
at
all
the
hotels
already
it
seemed
and
found
her
truant
at
none
of
them
now
she
ransacked
the
at
last
she
hunted
him
down
in
a
house
on
the
hill
i
could
see
she
was
really
hurt
you
viper
what
do
you
mean
by
trying
to
avoid
me
dear
aunt
here
in
schlangenbad
why
when
did
you
arrive
and
what
a
colour
you
got
you
looking
well
that
clever
thrust
saved
him
he
cast
me
an
appealing
glance
will
not
betray
me
it
said
i
answered
mutely
for
worlds
with
a
faltering
pair
of
downcast
eyelids
i
enough
thank
you
lady
georgina
replied
somewhat
mollified
by
his
astute
allusion
to
her
personal
appearance
he
had
hit
her
weak
point
dexterously
well
that
is
as
one
can
expect
to
be
nowadays
hereditary
gout
the
sins
of
the
fathers
visited
as
usual
but
why
did
you
come
to
see
me
can
i
come
to
see
you
if
you
do
tell
me
where
you
are
lady
georgina
fawley
europe
was
the
only
address
i
knew
it
strikes
me
as
insufficient
his
gentle
drawl
was
a
capital
foil
to
lady
georgina
acidulous
soprano
it
seemed
to
disarm
her
she
turned
to
me
with
a
benignant
wave
of
her
hand
cayley
she
said
introducing
me
nephew
harold
tillington
you
heard
me
talk
of
poor
tom
cayley
harold
this
is
poor
tom
cayley
daughter
the
supercilious
put
in
looking
hard
at
me
to
make
miss
cayley
acquaintance
harold
i
can
tell
from
your
voice
at
once
you
have
remembered
one
word
about
captain
cayley
harold
stood
on
the
defensive
dear
aunt
he
observed
expanding
both
palms
have
heard
you
talk
of
so
many
people
that
even
diplomatic
memory
fails
at
times
to
recollect
them
all
but
i
do
better
i
dissemble
i
will
plead
forgetfulness
now
of
captain
cayley
since
you
force
it
on
me
it
is
not
likely
i
shall
have
to
plead
it
of
captain
cayley
daughter
and
he
bowed
towards
me
gallantly
the
cantankerous
old
lady
darted
a
lightning
glance
at
him
it
was
a
glance
of
quick
suspicion
then
she
turned
her
rÃ¶ntgen
rays
upon
my
face
once
more
i
fear
i
burned
crimson
friend
he
asked
a
companion
it
was
the
first
nasty
thing
she
had
said
of
me
more
than
a
friend
then
a
comrade
he
turned
the
edge
neatly
we
walked
out
on
the
terrace
and
a
little
way
up
the
zigzag
path
the
day
was
superb
i
found
tillington
in
spite
of
his
studiously
languid
and
supercilious
air
a
most
agreeable
companion
he
knew
europe
he
was
full
of
talk
of
rome
and
the
romans
he
had
epigrammatic
wit
curt
keen
and
pointed
we
sat
down
on
a
bench
he
kept
lady
georgina
and
myself
amused
for
an
hour
by
his
crisp
sallies
besides
he
had
been
everywhere
and
seen
everybody
culture
and
agriculture
seemed
all
one
to
him
when
we
rose
to
go
in
lady
georgina
remarked
with
emphasis
course
harold
you
come
and
take
up
your
diggings
at
our
hotel
course
my
dear
aunt
how
can
you
ask
free
quarters
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
she
glanced
at
him
keenly
again
i
saw
she
had
expected
him
to
fake
up
some
lame
excuse
for
not
joining
us
and
i
fancied
she
was
annoyed
at
his
prompt
acquiescence
which
had
done
her
out
of
the
chance
for
a
family
disagreement
you
come
then
she
said
grudgingly
most
respected
aunt
i
shall
much
prefer
it
she
let
her
piercing
eye
descend
upon
me
once
more
i
was
aware
that
i
had
been
talking
with
frank
ease
of
manner
to
tillington
and
that
i
had
said
several
things
which
clearly
amused
him
then
i
remembered
all
at
once
our
relative
positions
a
companion
i
felt
should
know
her
place
it
is
not
her
to
be
smart
and
amusing
i
said
drawing
back
tillington
would
like
to
remain
in
his
present
quarters
till
the
end
of
the
week
while
i
am
with
you
lady
georgina
after
that
he
could
have
my
room
it
might
be
more
convenient
his
eye
caught
mine
quickly
you
only
going
to
stop
a
week
then
miss
cayley
he
put
in
with
an
air
of
disappointment
a
week
i
nodded
dear
child
the
cantankerous
old
lady
broke
out
nonsense
you
do
talk
only
going
to
stop
a
week
how
can
i
exist
without
you
was
the
arrangement
i
said
mischievously
were
going
to
look
about
you
recollect
for
an
unsophisticated
gretchen
you
happen
to
know
of
any
warehouse
where
a
supply
of
unsophisticated
gretchens
is
kept
constantly
in
stock
do
you
mr
tillington
i
do
he
answered
laughing
believe
there
are
dodos
and
auks
eggs
in
very
small
numbers
still
to
be
procured
in
the
proper
quarters
but
the
unsophisticated
gretchen
i
am
credibly
informed
is

why
the
cap
of
one
fetches
high
prices
nowadays
among
collectors
you
will
come
to
the
hotel
at
once
harold
lady
georgina
interposed
aunt
i
will
move
in
without
delay
if
miss
cayley
is
going
to
stay
for
a
single
week
only
that
adds
one
extra
inducement
for
joining
you
immediately
his
aunt
stony
eye
was
cold
as
marble
so
when
we
got
back
to
our
hotel
after
the
baths
that
afternoon
the
greeted
us
with
your
noble
nephew
has
arrived
countess
he
came
with
his
boxes
just
now
and
has
taken
a
room
near
your
honourable
ladyship
lady
georgina
face
was
a
study
of
mingled
emotions
i
do
know
whether
she
looked
more
pleased
or
jealous
later
in
the
day
i
chanced
on
tillington
sunning
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
hotel
garden
he
rose
and
came
up
to
me
as
fast
as
his
languid
nature
permitted
miss
cayley
he
said
abruptly
do
want
to
thank
you
so
much
for
not
betraying
me
i
know
you
spotted
me
twice
in
the
town
yesterday
and
i
also
know
you
were
good
enough
to
say
nothing
to
my
revered
aunt
about
it
had
no
reason
for
wishing
to
hurt
lady
georgina
feelings
i
answered
with
a
permissible
evasion
his
countenance
fell
never
thought
of
that
he
interposed
with
one
hand
on
his
moustache
i
fancied
you
did
it
out
of
all
think
of
things
mainly
from
our
own
point
of
view
first
i
answered
difference
is
that
some
of
us
think
of
them
from
other
people
afterwards
motives
are
mixed
he
smiled
did
know
my
deeply
venerated
relative
was
coming
here
so
soon
he
went
on
thought
she
was
expected
till
next
week
my
brother
wrote
me
that
she
had
quarrelled
with
her
french
maid
and
take
her
full
ten
days
to
get
another
i
meant
to
clear
out
before
she
arrived
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
going
now
you
are
stopping
on
he
caught
my
eye
again
illustration
circumstances
alter
cases
he
murmured
alter
cases
he
murmured
with
meaning
is
hardly
polite
to
describe
one
as
a
circumstance
i
objected
meant
he
said
quickly
aunt
alone
is
one
thing
my
aunt
with
a
friend
is
quite
another
see
i
answered
is
safety
in
numbers
he
eyed
me
hard
you
mediÃ¦val
or
modern
he
asked
i
hope
i
replied
then
i
looked
at
him
again
he
nodded
you
half
joking
i
said
glad
to
catch
him
out
college
yours
the
odd
rhyme
amused
him
thenceforth
we
were
friends
men
he
said
and
indeed
it
does
make
a
queer
sort
of
link
a
freemasonry
to
which
even
women
are
now
admitted
at
dinner
and
through
the
evening
he
talked
a
great
deal
to
me
lady
georgina
putting
in
from
time
to
time
a
characteristic
growl
about
the
chicken
special
breed
my
dear
with
eight
drumsticks
apiece
or
about
the
inadequate
lighting
of
the
heavy
german
she
was
worse
than
ever
pungent
as
a
rule
that
evening
she
was
grumpy
when
we
retired
for
the
night
to
my
great
surprise
she
walked
into
my
bedroom
she
seated
herself
on
my
bed
i
saw
she
had
come
to
talk
over
harold
will
be
very
rich
my
dear
you
know
a
great
catch
in
time
he
will
inherit
all
my
brother
money
kynaston
the
child
no
kynaston
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
with
the
tithes
unpaid
he
has
three
sons
of
his
own
and
not
a
blessed
stiver
to
leave
between
them
how
could
he
poor
dear
idiot
agricultural
depression
a
splendid
pauper
he
has
only
the
estate
and
that
in
essex
land
going
begging
worth
nothing
a
year
encumbered
up
to
the
eyes
and
loaded
with
first
jointures
settlements
money
indeed
poor
kynaston
it
my
brother
marmaduke
i
mean
lucky
dog
went
in
for
speculation
began
life
as
a
and
rose
with
the
rise
of
soap
and
cocoa
he
worth
his
marmaduke
lady
georgina
nodded
a
fool
she
said
briefly
he
knows
which
side
of
his
bread
is
buttered
tillington
is
his
nephew
the
child
yes
have
you
never
read
your
british
bible
the
peerage
astonishing
the
ignorance
of
these
girton
girls
they
even
know
the
leger
run
at
doncaster
the
family
name
ashurst
kynaston
an
earl
i
was
lady
georgina
ashurst
before
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
marry
and
do
for
poor
evelyn
fawley
my
younger
brother
the
honourable
marmaduke
ashurst
women
get
the
best
of
it
there
it
about
the
only
place
where
they
do
get
the
best
of
it
an
earl
daughter
is
lady
betty
his
son
nothing
more
than
the
honourable
tom
so
one
scores
off
one
brothers
my
younger
sister
lady
guinevere
ashurst
married
stanley
tillington
of
the
foreign
office
harold
their
eldest
son
now
child
do
you
grasp
it
i
answered
speak
like
debrett
has
issue
harold
harold
will
inherit
all
marmaduke
money
what
i
always
afraid
of
is
that
some
fascinating
adventuress
will
try
to
marry
him
out
of
hand
a
pretty
face
and
over
goes
harold
business
in
life
is
to
stand
in
the
way
and
prevent
it
she
looked
me
through
and
through
again
with
her
scrutiny
do
think
tillington
is
quite
the
sort
that
falls
a
prey
to
adventuresses
i
answered
boldly
but
there
are
faggots
and
faggots
the
old
lady
said
wagging
her
head
with
profound
meaning
mind
though
like
to
see
an
adventuress
marry
off
harold
without
my
leave
lead
her
a
life
i
turn
her
black
hair
gray
for
her
should
think
i
assented
could
do
it
lady
georgina
if
you
gave
your
attention
seriously
to
it
from
that
moment
forth
i
was
aware
that
my
cantankerous
old
malign
eye
was
inexorably
fixed
upon
me
every
time
i
went
within
speaking
distance
of
tillington
she
watched
him
like
a
lynx
she
watched
like
a
dozen
lynxes
wherever
we
went
lady
georgina
was
sure
to
turn
up
in
the
neighbourhood
she
was
perfectly
ubiquitous
she
seemed
to
possess
a
circulation
i
do
know
whether
it
was
this
constant
suggestion
of
hers
that
i
was
stalking
her
nephew
which
roused
my
latent
human
feeling
of
opposition
but
in
the
end
i
began
to
be
aware
that
i
rather
liked
the
supercilious
than
otherwise
he
evidently
liked
me
and
he
tried
to
meet
me
whenever
he
spoke
to
me
indeed
it
was
without
the
superciliousness
which
marked
his
manner
towards
others
in
point
of
fact
it
was
with
graceful
deference
he
watched
for
me
on
the
stairs
in
the
garden
by
the
terrace
whenever
he
got
a
chance
he
sidled
over
and
talked
to
me
sometimes
he
stopped
in
to
read
me
heine
he
also
introduced
me
to
select
portions
of
gabriele
it
is
feminine
to
be
touched
by
such
obvious
attention
i
confess
before
long
i
grew
to
like
harold
tillington
the
closer
he
followed
me
up
the
more
did
i
perceive
that
lady
georgina
threw
out
acrid
hints
with
increasing
spleen
about
the
ways
of
adventuresses
they
were
hints
of
that
acrimonious
generalised
kind
too
which
one
can
not
answer
back
without
seeming
to
admit
that
the
cap
has
fitted
it
was
atrocious
how
young
women
nowadays
ran
after
young
men
of
birth
and
fortune
a
girl
would
stoop
to
anything
in
order
to
catch
five
hundred
thousand
guileless
youths
should
be
thrown
among
their
natural
equals
it
was
a
mistake
to
let
them
see
too
much
of
people
of
a
lower
rank
who
consider
themselves
and
the
clever
ones
were
the
worst
they
pretended
to
go
in
for
intellectual
companionship
i
also
noticed
that
though
at
first
lady
georgina
had
expressed
the
strongest
disinclination
to
my
leaving
her
after
the
time
originally
proposed
she
now
began
to
take
for
granted
that
i
would
go
at
the
end
of
my
week
as
arranged
in
london
and
she
even
went
on
to
some
overt
steps
towards
securing
the
help
of
the
blameless
gretchen
we
had
arrived
at
schlangenbad
on
tuesday
i
was
to
stop
with
the
cantankerous
old
lady
till
the
corresponding
day
of
the
following
week
on
the
sunday
i
wandered
out
on
the
wooded
hillside
behind
the
village
and
as
i
mounted
the
path
i
was
dimly
aware
by
a
sort
of
instinct
that
harold
tillington
was
following
me
he
came
up
with
me
at
last
near
a
ledge
of
rock
fast
you
walk
he
exclaimed
gave
you
only
a
few
minutes
start
and
yet
even
my
long
legs
have
had
hard
work
to
overtake
you
am
a
fairly
good
climber
i
answered
sitting
down
on
a
little
wooden
bench
see
at
cambridge
i
went
on
the
river
a
great
deal
i
canoed
and
sculled
and
then
besides
i
done
a
lot
of
bicycling
a
splendid
birthright
it
is
he
cried
be
a
wholesome
athletic
english
girl
you
ca
think
how
one
admires
english
girls
after
living
a
year
or
two
in
italy
where
women
are
dolls
except
for
a
brief
period
of
intrigue
before
they
settle
down
to
be
contented
frumps
with
an
outline
like
a
barrel
little
muscle
and
a
little
mind
are
no
doubt
advisable
adjuncts
for
a
housewife
i
admitted
shall
not
say
that
word
he
cried
seating
himself
at
my
side
is
a
word
for
germans
housewife
our
english
ideal
is
something
immeasurably
higher
and
better
a
companion
a
complement
do
you
know
miss
cayley
it
always
sickens
me
when
i
hear
german
students
sentimentalising
over
their
their
beautiful
pure
insipid
her
so
fair
so
innocent
so
unapproachably
vacuous
so
like
a
wax
doll
and
then
think
of
how
they
design
her
in
days
to
come
to
cook
sausages
for
their
dinner
and
knit
them
endless
stockings
through
a
placid
middle
age
till
the
needles
drop
from
her
paralysed
fingers
and
she
retires
into
frilled
caps
and
teutonic
senility
seem
to
have
almost
as
low
an
opinion
of
foreigners
as
your
respected
aunt
i
exclaimed
looking
quizzically
at
him
he
drew
back
surprised
no
i
not
like
my
aunt
i
hope
he
answered
am
a
good
cosmopolitan
i
allow
continental
nations
all
their
own
good
points
and
each
has
many
but
their
women
miss
cayley
and
their
point
of
view
of
their
women
you
will
admit
that
there
they
ca
hold
a
candle
to
english
women
i
drew
a
circle
in
the
dust
with
the
tip
of
my
parasol
that
issue
i
may
not
be
a
wholly
unprejudiced
observer
i
answered
fact
of
my
being
myself
an
englishwoman
may
possibly
to
some
extent
influence
my
judgment
are
sarcastic
he
cried
drawing
away
at
all
i
answered
making
a
wider
circle
spoke
a
simple
fact
but
what
is
ideal
then
as
opposed
to
the
german
one
he
gazed
at
me
and
hesitated
his
lips
half
parted
ideal
he
said
after
a
pause
ideal
do
you
happen
to
have
such
a
thing
as
a
about
you
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
tillington
i
said
severely
you
going
to
pay
compliments
i
shall
have
to
return
if
you
want
to
stop
here
with
me
you
must
remember
that
i
am
only
lady
georgina
fawley
temporary
besides
i
did
mean
that
i
meant
what
is
your
ideal
of
a
man
right
relation
to
his
say
he
cried
petulantly
sounds
as
if
you
thought
me
one
of
those
sentimental
germans
i
hate
sentiment
towards
the
woman
of
his
choice
he
glanced
up
through
the
trees
at
the
light
overhead
and
spoke
more
slowly
than
ever
think
he
said
fumbling
his
nervously
man
ought
to
wish
the
woman
he
loves
to
be
a
free
agent
his
equal
in
point
of
action
even
as
she
is
nobler
and
better
than
he
in
all
spiritual
matters
i
think
he
ought
to
desire
for
her
a
life
as
high
as
she
is
capable
of
leading
with
full
scope
for
every
faculty
of
her
intellect
or
her
emotional
nature
she
should
be
beautiful
with
a
vigorous
wholesome
beauty
moral
intellectual
physical
yet
with
soul
in
her
too
and
with
the
soul
and
the
mind
lighting
up
her
eyes
as
it
lights
up
well
that
is
immaterial
and
if
a
man
can
discover
such
a
woman
as
that
and
can
induce
her
to
believe
in
him
to
love
him
to
accept
him
though
how
such
a
woman
can
be
satisfied
with
any
man
at
all
is
to
me
unfathomable
well
then
i
think
he
should
be
happy
in
devoting
his
whole
life
to
her
and
should
give
himself
up
to
repay
her
condescension
in
taking
him
you
hate
sentiment
i
put
in
smiling
illustration
miss
cayley
he
said
you
are
playing
with
me
he
brought
his
eyes
back
from
the
sky
suddenly
cayley
he
said
is
cruel
i
was
in
earnest
you
are
playing
with
me
believe
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
english
girl
is
supposed
to
be
common
sense
i
answered
calmly
i
trust
i
possess
it
but
indeed
as
he
spoke
my
heart
was
beginning
to
make
its
beat
felt
for
he
was
a
charming
young
man
he
had
a
soft
voice
and
lustrous
eyes
it
was
a
summer
day
and
alone
in
the
woods
with
one
other
person
where
the
sunlight
falls
mellow
in
spots
like
a
leopard
skin
one
is
apt
to
remember
that
we
are
all
human
that
evening
lady
georgina
managed
to
blurt
out
more
malicious
things
than
ever
about
the
ways
of
adventuresses
and
the
duty
of
relations
in
saving
young
men
from
the
clever
clutches
of
designing
creatures
she
was
ruthless
in
her
rancour
her
gibes
stung
me
on
monday
at
breakfast
i
asked
her
casually
if
she
had
yet
found
a
gretchen
she
answered
in
a
gloomy
voice
slatterns
my
dear
all
slatterns
brought
up
in
i
would
let
one
of
them
touch
my
hair
for
thousands
unfortunate
i
said
drily
you
know
i
going
if
i
had
dropped
a
bomb
in
their
midst
they
could
have
looked
more
astonished
lady
georgina
gasped
clutching
my
arm
do
mean
it
child
you
do
mean
it
i
asserted
my
ego
i
answered
with
my
coolest
air
said
i
thought
i
could
manage
you
for
a
week
and
i
have
managed
you
she
almost
burst
into
tears
my
child
my
child
what
shall
i
do
without
you
unsophisticated
gretchen
i
answered
trying
not
to
look
concerned
for
in
my
heart
of
hearts
in
spite
of
her
innuendoes
i
had
really
grown
rather
to
like
the
cantankerous
old
lady
she
rose
hastily
from
the
table
and
darted
up
to
her
own
room
she
said
as
she
rose
in
a
curious
voice
of
mingled
regret
and
suspicion
will
talk
to
you
about
this
later
i
could
see
she
was
not
quite
satisfied
in
her
own
mind
whether
harold
tillington
and
i
had
not
arranged
this
together
i
put
on
my
hat
and
strolled
off
into
the
garden
and
then
along
the
mossy
hill
path
in
a
minute
more
harold
tillington
was
beside
me
he
seated
me
half
against
my
will
on
a
rustic
bench
here
miss
cayley
he
said
with
a
very
earnest
face
this
really
true
are
you
going
my
voice
trembled
a
little
i
answered
biting
my
lip
am
going
i
see
several
reasons
why
i
should
go
mr
tillington
so
soon
i
think
so
the
sooner
the
better
my
heart
was
racing
now
and
his
eyes
pleaded
mutely
where
are
you
going
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
pouted
my
lips
a
little
do
know
i
replied
world
is
all
before
me
where
to
choose
i
am
an
adventuress
i
said
it
boldly
i
am
in
quest
of
adventures
i
really
have
not
yet
given
a
thought
to
my
next
place
of
sojourn
you
will
let
me
know
when
you
have
decided
it
was
time
to
speak
out
tillington
i
said
with
decision
will
let
you
know
one
of
my
reasons
for
going
is
that
i
think
i
had
better
see
no
more
of
you
he
flung
himself
on
the
bench
at
my
side
and
folded
his
hands
in
a
helpless
attitude
miss
cayley
he
cried
is
so
short
a
notice
you
give
a
fellow
no
chance
i
hoped
i
might
have
seen
more
of
you
might
have
had
some
opportunity
of
of
letting
you
realise
how
deeply
i
admired
and
respected
you
some
opportunity
of
showing
myself
as
i
really
am
to
you
before
before
he
paused
and
looked
hard
at
me
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
really
liked
him
so
much
and
when
he
spoke
in
that
voice
i
could
not
bear
to
seem
cruel
to
him
indeed
i
was
aware
at
the
moment
how
much
i
had
grown
to
care
for
him
in
those
six
short
days
but
i
knew
it
was
impossible
say
it
tillington
i
murmured
turning
my
face
away
less
said
the
sooner
mended
i
must
he
cried
must
tell
you
now
if
i
am
to
have
no
chance
afterwards
i
wanted
you
to
see
more
of
me
before
i
ventured
to
ask
you
if
you
could
ever
love
me
if
you
could
ever
suffer
me
to
go
through
life
with
you
to
share
my
all
with
you
he
seized
my
trembling
hand
he
cried
in
a
pleading
voice
ask
you
i
ca
expect
you
to
answer
me
now
but
say
you
will
give
me
at
least
some
other
chance
of
seeing
you
and
then
in
time
of
pressing
my
suit
upon
you
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
he
was
so
earnest
so
charming
but
i
remembered
lady
georgina
and
his
prospective
i
moved
his
hand
away
gently
can
not
i
said
can
not
i
am
a
penniless
girl
an
adventuress
your
family
your
uncle
would
never
forgive
you
if
you
married
me
i
will
not
stand
in
your
way
i
i
like
you
very
much
though
i
have
seen
so
little
of
you
but
i
feel
it
is
impossible
and
i
am
going
illustration
i
rose
of
a
sudden
and
ran
down
the
hill
then
i
rose
of
a
sudden
and
ran
down
the
hill
with
all
my
might
lest
i
should
break
my
resolve
never
stopping
once
till
i
reached
my
own
bedroom
an
hour
later
lady
georgina
burst
in
upon
me
in
high
dudgeon
lois
my
child
she
cried
this
what
on
earth
does
it
mean
harold
tells
me
he
has
proposed
to
you
proposed
to
you
and
rejected
him
i
dried
my
eyes
and
tried
to
look
steadily
at
her
lady
georgina
i
faltered
need
not
be
afraid
i
have
refused
him
and
i
mean
it
she
looked
at
me
all
aghast
you
mean
it
she
repeated
mean
to
refuse
him
then
all
i
can
say
is
lois
cayley
i
call
it
pure
cheek
of
you
i
cried
drawing
back
cheek
she
answered
volubly
thousand
a
year
and
a
good
old
family
harold
tillington
is
my
nephew
he
an
grandson
he
an
at
rome
and
he
bound
to
be
one
of
the
richest
commoners
in
england
who
are
you
i
like
to
know
miss
that
you
dare
to
reject
him
i
stared
at
her
amazed
lady
georgina
i
cried
said
you
wished
to
protect
your
nephew
against
adventuresses
who
were
setting
their
caps
at
him
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
course
she
answered
with
withering
scorn
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
catch
him
he
tells
me
now
you
wo
have
him
and
you
wo
tell
him
where
you
are
going
i
call
it
sheer
insolence
where
do
you
hail
from
girl
that
you
should
refuse
my
nephew
a
man
that
any
woman
in
england
would
be
proud
to
marry
forty
thousand
a
year
and
an
earl
grandson
that
what
comes
i
suppose
of
going
to
girton
i
drew
myself
up
georgina
i
said
coldly
can
not
allow
you
to
use
such
language
to
me
i
promised
to
accompany
you
to
germany
for
a
week
and
i
have
kept
my
word
i
like
your
nephew
i
respect
your
nephew
he
has
behaved
like
a
gentleman
but
i
will
marry
him
your
own
conduct
showed
me
in
the
plainest
way
that
you
did
not
judge
such
a
match
desirable
for
him
and
i
have
common
sense
enough
to
see
that
you
were
quite
right
i
am
a
lady
by
birth
and
education
i
am
an
officer
daughter
but
i
am
not
what
society
calls
a
good
match
for
tillington
he
had
better
marry
into
a
rich
stockbroker
family
it
was
an
unworthy
taunt
the
moment
it
escaped
my
lips
i
regretted
it
illustration
i
was
going
to
oppose
you
and
harold
to
my
intense
surprise
however
lady
georgina
flung
herself
on
my
bed
and
burst
into
tears
dear
she
sobbed
out
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
thought
you
would
be
sure
to
set
your
cap
at
harold
and
after
i
had
seen
you
for
hours
i
said
to
myself
just
the
sort
of
girl
harold
ought
to
fall
in
love
with
i
felt
sure
he
would
fall
in
love
with
you
i
brought
you
here
on
purpose
i
saw
you
had
all
the
qualities
that
would
strike
harold
fancy
so
i
had
made
up
my
mind
for
a
delightful
regulation
family
quarrel
i
was
going
to
oppose
you
and
harold
tooth
and
nail
i
was
going
to
threaten
that
marmy
would
leave
his
money
to
kynaston
eldest
son
i
was
going
to
kick
up
oh
a
dickens
of
a
row
about
it
then
of
course
in
the
end
we
should
all
have
been
reconciled
we
should
have
kissed
and
made
friends
for
you
just
the
one
girl
in
the
world
for
harold
indeed
i
never
met
anybody
so
capable
and
so
intelligent
and
now
you
spoil
all
my
sport
by
going
and
refusing
him
it
really
most
of
you
and
harold
has
sent
me
here
he
trembling
with
anxiety
to
see
whether
i
ca
induce
you
to
think
better
of
your
decision
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
lady
georgina
i
said
in
my
gentlest
voice
positively
stooping
down
and
kissing
her
like
tillington
very
much
i
dare
not
tell
you
how
much
i
like
him
he
is
a
dear
good
kind
fellow
but
i
can
not
rest
under
the
cruel
imputation
of
being
moved
by
his
wealth
and
having
tried
to
capture
him
even
if
think
so
his
family
would
i
am
sorry
to
go
for
in
a
way
i
like
you
but
it
is
best
to
adhere
to
our
original
plan
if
changed
my
mind
might
change
yours
again
let
us
say
no
more
i
will
go
you
will
see
harold
again
alone
only
at
dinner
for
i
feared
lest
if
he
spoke
to
me
alone
he
might
me
at
least
you
will
tell
him
where
you
are
going
lady
georgina
i
do
not
know
myself
and
besides
it
is
best
that
this
should
now
be
final
she
flung
herself
upon
me
my
dear
child
a
lady
ca
go
out
into
the
world
with
only
two
pounds
in
pocket
you
let
me
lend
you
something
i
unwound
her
clasping
hands
dear
lady
georgina
i
said
though
i
was
loth
to
say
it
are
very
sweet
and
good
but
i
must
work
out
my
life
in
my
own
way
i
have
started
to
work
it
out
and
i
wo
be
turned
aside
just
here
on
the
threshold
you
wo
stop
with
me
she
cried
opening
her
arms
think
me
too
cantankerous
think
you
have
a
dear
kind
old
heart
i
said
the
quaintest
and
crustiest
outside
such
a
heart
ever
wore
you
a
truculent
old
darling
so
that
the
plain
truth
of
it
she
kissed
me
i
kissed
her
in
return
with
fervour
though
i
am
but
a
poor
hand
at
kissing
for
a
woman
now
this
episode
is
concluded
i
murmured
do
know
about
that
she
said
drying
her
eyes
have
set
my
heart
upon
you
now
and
harold
has
set
his
heart
upon
you
and
considering
that
your
own
heart
goes
much
the
same
way
i
daresay
my
dear
we
shall
find
in
the
end
some
convenient
road
out
of
it
nevertheless
next
morning
i
set
out
by
myself
in
the
coach
from
schlangenbad
i
went
forth
into
the
world
to
live
my
own
life
partly
because
it
was
just
then
so
fashionable
but
mainly
because
fate
had
denied
me
the
chance
of
living
anybody
else
iii
the
adventure
of
the
inquisitive
american
in
one
week
i
had
multiplied
my
capital
two
hundred
and
i
left
london
with
twopence
in
the
world
i
quitted
schlangenbad
with
two
pounds
in
pocket
a
splendid
i
thought
to
myself
this
luck
holds
at
the
same
rate
i
shall
have
made
four
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
by
tuesday
next
and
i
may
look
forward
to
being
a
barney
barnato
by
christmas
for
i
had
taken
high
mathematical
honours
at
cambridge
and
if
there
is
anything
on
earth
on
which
i
pride
myself
it
is
my
firm
grasp
of
the
principle
of
ratios
still
in
spite
of
this
brilliant
financial
prospect
a
budding
klondike
i
went
away
from
the
little
spa
on
the
flanks
of
the
taunus
with
a
heavy
heart
i
had
grown
quite
to
like
dear
virulent
fidgety
old
lady
georgina
and
i
felt
that
it
had
cost
me
a
distinct
wrench
to
part
with
harold
tillington
the
wrench
left
a
scar
which
was
long
in
healing
but
as
i
am
not
a
professional
sentimentalist
i
will
not
trouble
you
here
with
details
of
the
symptoms
my
livelihood
however
was
now
assured
me
with
two
pounds
in
pocket
a
sensible
girl
can
read
her
title
clear
to
six
days
board
and
lodging
at
six
marks
a
day
with
a
glorious
margin
of
four
marks
over
for
and
if
at
the
end
of
six
days
my
fairy
godmother
had
not
pointed
me
out
some
other
means
of
earning
my
bread
honestly
well
i
should
feel
myself
unworthy
to
be
ranked
in
the
noble
army
of
adventuresses
i
thank
thee
lady
georgina
for
teaching
me
that
word
an
adventuress
i
would
be
for
i
loved
adventure
meanwhile
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
fill
up
the
interval
by
going
to
study
art
at
frankfort
elsie
petheridge
had
been
there
and
had
impressed
upon
me
the
fact
that
i
must
on
no
account
omit
to
see
the
stÃ¤del
gallery
she
was
strong
on
culture
besides
the
study
of
art
should
be
most
useful
to
an
adventuress
for
she
must
need
all
the
arts
that
human
skill
has
developed
so
to
frankfort
i
betook
myself
and
found
there
a
nice
little
ladies
only
frau
bockenheifner
assured
me
at
very
moderate
rates
in
a
pleasant
part
of
the
lindenstrasse
it
had
dimity
curtains
i
will
not
deny
that
as
i
entered
the
house
i
was
conscious
of
feeling
lonely
my
heart
sank
once
or
twice
as
i
glanced
round
the
at
the
german
old
maids
who
formed
the
of
my
there
they
sat
eight
comfortable
fraus
who
had
missed
their
vocation
plentiful
ladies
bulging
and
surging
in
tightly
stretched
black
silk
bodices
they
had
been
cut
out
for
such
housewives
as
harold
tillington
had
described
but
found
themselves
deprived
of
their
natural
sphere
in
life
by
the
unaccountable
caprice
of
the
men
of
their
nation
each
was
a
model
teutonic
matron
each
looked
capable
of
frying
frankfort
sausages
to
a
turn
and
knitting
woollen
socks
to
a
remote
eternity
but
i
sought
in
vain
for
one
kindred
soul
among
them
how
horrified
they
would
have
been
with
their
fat
and
big
had
i
boldly
announced
myself
as
an
english
adventuress
i
spent
my
first
morning
in
laborious
at
the
ariadneum
and
the
stÃ¤del
gallery
i
borrowed
a
catalogue
i
wrestled
with
van
der
weyden
i
toiled
like
a
at
meister
wilhelm
and
meister
stephan
i
have
a
confused
recollection
that
i
saw
a
number
of
stiff
mediÃ¦val
pictures
and
an
alabaster
statue
of
the
lady
who
smiled
as
she
rode
on
a
tiger
taken
at
the
beginning
of
that
interesting
episode
but
the
remainder
of
the
institute
has
faded
from
my
memory
in
the
afternoon
i
consoled
myself
for
my
herculean
efforts
in
the
direction
of
culture
by
going
out
for
a
bicycle
ride
on
a
hired
machine
to
which
end
i
decided
to
devote
my
you
will
perhaps
object
here
that
my
conduct
was
imprudent
to
raise
that
objection
is
to
misunderstand
the
spirit
of
these
artless
adventures
i
told
you
that
i
set
out
to
go
round
the
world
but
to
go
round
the
world
does
not
necessarily
mean
to
circumnavigate
it
my
idea
was
to
go
round
by
easy
stages
seeing
the
world
as
i
went
as
far
as
i
got
and
taking
as
little
heed
as
possible
of
the
morrow
most
of
my
readers
no
doubt
accept
that
philosophy
of
life
on
sundays
only
on
they
swallow
the
usual
contradictory
economic
platitudes
about
prudential
forethought
and
the
horrid
improvidence
of
the
lower
classes
for
myself
i
am
not
built
that
way
i
prefer
to
take
life
in
a
spirit
of
pure
inquiry
i
put
on
my
hat
i
saunter
where
i
choose
so
far
as
circumstances
permit
and
i
wait
to
see
what
chance
will
bring
me
my
ideal
is
breeziness
the
hired
bicycle
was
not
a
bad
machine
as
hired
bicycles
go
it
jolted
one
as
little
as
you
can
expect
from
a
common
hack
it
never
stopped
at
a
and
it
showed
very
few
signs
of
having
been
ridden
by
beginners
with
an
unconquerable
desire
to
tilt
at
the
hedgerow
so
off
i
soared
at
once
heedless
of
the
jeers
of
teutonic
youth
who
found
the
sight
of
a
lady
riding
a
cycle
in
skirts
a
strange
one
for
in
south
germany
the
costume
is
so
universal
among
women
cyclists
that
the
skirt
that
provokes
unfavourable
comment
from
those
jealous
guardians
of
female
propriety
the
street
boys
i
hurried
on
at
a
brisk
pace
past
the
and
the
suburbs
with
my
loose
hair
straying
on
the
breeze
behind
till
i
found
myself
pedalling
at
a
good
round
pace
on
a
broad
level
road
which
led
towards
a
village
by
name
fraunheim
as
i
scurried
across
the
plain
with
the
wind
in
my
face
not
unpleasantly
i
had
some
dim
consciousness
of
somebody
unknown
flying
after
me
headlong
my
first
idea
was
that
harold
tillington
had
hunted
me
down
and
tracked
me
to
my
lair
but
gazing
back
i
saw
my
pursuer
was
a
tall
and
ungainly
man
with
a
moustache
apparently
american
and
that
he
was
following
me
on
his
machine
closely
watching
my
action
he
had
such
a
cunning
expression
on
his
face
and
seemed
so
strangely
inquisitive
with
eyes
riveted
on
my
treadles
that
i
quite
like
the
look
of
him
i
put
on
the
pace
to
see
if
i
could
outstrip
him
for
i
am
a
swift
cyclist
but
his
long
legs
were
too
much
for
me
he
did
not
gain
on
me
it
is
true
but
neither
did
i
outpace
him
pedalling
my
very
hardest
and
i
can
make
good
time
when
necessary
i
still
kept
pretty
much
at
the
same
distance
in
front
of
him
all
the
way
to
fraunheim
illustration
he
kept
close
at
my
heels
gradually
i
began
to
feel
sure
that
the
man
with
the
alert
face
was
really
pursuing
me
when
i
went
faster
he
went
faster
too
when
i
gave
him
a
chance
to
pass
me
he
kept
close
at
my
heels
and
appeared
to
be
keenly
watching
the
style
of
my
i
gathered
that
he
was
a
connoisseur
but
why
on
earth
he
should
persecute
me
i
could
not
imagine
my
spirit
was
roused
now
i
pedalled
with
a
will
if
i
rode
all
day
i
would
not
let
him
go
past
me
beyond
the
chief
street
of
fraunheim
the
road
took
a
sharp
bend
and
began
to
mount
the
slopes
of
the
taunus
suddenly
it
was
an
abrupt
steep
climb
but
i
flatter
myself
i
am
a
tolerable
mountain
cyclist
i
rode
sturdily
on
my
pursuer
darted
after
me
but
on
this
stiff
upward
grade
my
light
weight
and
agile
told
i
began
to
distance
him
he
seemed
afraid
that
i
would
give
him
the
slip
and
called
out
suddenly
with
a
whoop
in
english
miss
i
looked
back
with
dignity
but
answered
nothing
he
put
on
the
pace
panting
i
pedalled
away
and
got
clear
from
him
illustration
i
was
pulled
up
short
by
a
mounted
policeman
at
a
turn
of
the
corner
however
as
luck
would
have
it
i
was
pulled
up
short
by
a
mounted
policeman
he
blocked
the
road
with
his
horse
like
an
ogre
and
asked
me
in
a
very
gruff
swabian
voice
if
this
was
a
licensed
bicycle
i
had
no
idea
till
he
spoke
that
any
license
was
required
though
to
be
sure
i
might
have
guessed
it
for
modern
germany
is
studded
with
notices
at
all
the
street
corners
to
inform
you
in
minute
detail
that
everything
is
forbidden
i
stammered
out
that
i
did
not
know
the
mounted
policeman
drew
near
and
inspected
me
rudely
is
strongly
undersaid
he
began
but
just
at
that
moment
my
pursuer
came
up
and
with
american
quickness
took
in
the
situation
he
accosted
the
policeman
in
choice
bad
german
have
two
licenses
he
said
producing
a
handful
frÃ¤ulein
rides
with
me
i
was
too
much
taken
aback
at
so
providential
an
interposition
to
contradict
this
highly
imaginative
statement
my
highwayman
had
turned
into
a
protecting
of
injured
innocence
i
let
the
policeman
go
his
way
then
i
glanced
at
my
preserver
a
very
ordinary
modern
george
he
looked
with
no
lance
to
speak
of
and
no
steed
but
a
bicycle
yet
his
mien
was
reassuring
morning
miss
he
began
he
called
me
every
time
he
addressed
me
as
though
he
took
me
for
a
barmaid
but
why
did
you
want
to
speed
her
thought
you
were
pursuing
me
i
answered
a
little
tremulous
i
will
confess
but
avid
of
incident
if
i
was
he
went
on
might
have
miss
it
was
for
our
mutual
advantage
a
business
man
do
go
out
of
his
way
unless
he
expects
to
turn
an
honest
dollar
and
he
do
reckon
on
other
folks
going
out
of
theirs
unless
he
knows
he
can
put
them
in
the
way
of
turning
an
honest
dollar
with
him
reasonable
i
answered
for
i
am
a
political
economist
benefit
should
be
mutual
but
i
wondered
if
he
was
going
to
propose
at
sight
to
me
he
looked
me
all
up
and
down
a
lady
of
personal
attractions
he
said
musingly
as
if
he
were
criticising
a
horse
i
want
one
that
sort
that
jest
why
i
trailed
you
see
besides
which
there
some
style
about
you
i
repeated
he
went
on
know
how
to
use
your
feet
and
you
have
good
understandings
i
gathered
from
his
glance
that
he
referred
to
my
nether
limbs
we
are
all
vertebrate
animals
why
seek
to
conceal
the
fact
fail
to
follow
you
i
answered
frigidly
for
i
really
did
know
what
the
man
might
say
next
illustration
seems
i
did
make
much
of
a
job
of
it
so
he
replied
was
that
followed
seems
i
make
much
of
a
job
of
it
either
anyway
i
mounted
my
machine
again
good
morning
i
said
coldy
am
much
obliged
for
your
kind
assistance
but
your
remark
was
fictitious
and
i
desire
to
go
on
unaccompanied
he
held
up
his
hand
in
warning
ai
going
he
cried
horrified
ai
going
without
hearing
me
i
mean
business
say
do
chuck
away
good
money
like
that
i
tell
you
there
dollars
in
it
what
i
asked
still
moving
on
but
curious
on
the
slope
if
need
were
i
could
easily
distance
him
in
this
cycling
of
yours
he
replied
jest
about
the
very
woman
i
looking
for
miss
lithe
that
what
i
call
you
i
kin
put
you
in
the
way
of
making
your
pile
i
kin
this
is
a
offer
no
flies
on
business
you
decline
it
prejudice
injures
you
injures
me
be
reasonable
anyway
i
looked
round
and
laughed
yourself
i
said
briefly
he
rose
to
it
like
a
man
me
at
fraunheim
corner
by
the
post
office
ten
morning
he
shouted
as
i
rode
off
ef
i
do
convince
you
there
money
in
this
job
my
name
not
cyrus
w
hitchcock
something
about
his
keen
unlovely
face
impressed
me
with
a
sense
of
his
underlying
honesty
well
i
answered
come
if
you
follow
me
no
further
i
reflected
that
fraunheim
was
a
populous
village
and
that
only
beyond
it
did
the
mountain
road
over
the
taunus
begin
to
grow
lonely
if
he
wished
to
cut
my
throat
i
was
well
within
reach
of
the
resources
of
civilisation
when
i
got
home
to
the
abode
of
blighted
fraus
that
evening
i
debated
seriously
with
myself
whether
or
not
i
should
accept
cyrus
hitchcock
mysterious
invitation
prudence
said
curiosity
said
i
put
the
question
to
a
meeting
of
one
and
since
i
am
a
daughter
of
eve
curiosity
had
it
carried
unanimously
i
think
i
might
have
hesitated
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
blighted
fraus
their
talk
was
of
dinner
and
of
the
digestive
process
they
were
critics
of
digestion
they
each
of
them
sat
so
complacently
through
the
evening
solid
and
stolid
stodgy
and
podgy
stuffed
comatose
images
knitting
white
woollen
shawls
to
throw
over
their
capacious
shoulders
at
and
they
purred
with
such
content
in
their
rotundity
that
i
made
up
my
mind
i
must
take
warning
betimes
and
avoid
their
temptations
to
adipose
deposit
i
prefer
to
grow
upwards
the
frau
grows
sideways
better
get
my
throat
cut
by
an
american
desperado
in
my
pursuit
of
romance
than
settle
down
on
a
rock
like
a
placid
fat
oyster
i
am
not
by
nature
sessile
adventures
are
to
the
adventurous
they
abound
on
every
side
but
only
the
chosen
few
have
the
courage
to
embrace
them
and
they
will
not
come
to
you
you
must
go
out
to
seek
them
then
they
meet
you
and
rush
into
your
arms
for
they
know
their
true
lovers
there
were
eight
blighted
fraus
at
the
home
for
lost
ideals
and
i
could
tell
by
simple
inspection
that
they
had
not
had
an
average
of
half
an
adventure
per
lifetime
between
them
they
sat
and
knitted
still
like
awful
examples
if
i
had
declined
to
meet
hitchcock
at
fraunheim
i
know
not
what
changes
it
might
have
induced
in
my
life
i
might
now
be
knitting
but
i
went
boldly
forth
on
a
voyage
of
exploration
prepared
to
accept
aught
that
fate
held
in
store
for
me
as
hitchcock
had
assured
me
there
was
money
in
his
offer
i
felt
justified
in
speculating
i
expended
another
three
marks
on
the
hire
of
a
bicycle
though
i
ran
the
risk
thereby
of
going
perhaps
without
monday
dinner
that
showed
my
vocation
the
blighted
fraus
i
felt
sure
would
have
clung
to
their
dinner
at
all
hazards
when
i
arrived
at
fraunheim
i
found
my
alert
american
punctually
there
before
me
he
raised
his
crush
hat
with
awkward
politeness
i
could
see
he
was
little
accustomed
to
ladies
society
then
he
pointed
to
a
close
cab
in
which
he
had
reached
the
village
got
it
inside
he
whispered
in
a
confidential
tone
let
ketch
sight
of
it
you
see
there
dollars
in
it
have
you
got
inside
i
asked
suspiciously
drawing
back
i
know
why
but
the
word
somehow
suggested
a
corpse
i
began
to
grow
frightened
the
wheel
of
course
he
answered
you
come
here
to
ride
it
the
wheel
i
echoed
vaguely
pretending
to
look
wise
but
unaware
as
yet
that
that
word
was
the
accepted
americanism
for
a
cycle
i
have
come
to
ride
it
certainly
he
replied
jerking
his
hand
towards
the
cab
we
must
start
right
here
this
thing
has
got
to
be
kept
dark
do
you
see
till
the
last
day
till
the
last
day
that
was
ominous
it
sounded
like
monomania
so
ghostly
and
elusive
i
began
to
suspect
my
american
ally
of
being
a
dangerous
madman
you
wheel
away
a
bit
up
the
hill
he
went
on
o
sight
of
the
folks
and
i
fetch
her
along
to
you
i
cried
for
the
man
bewildered
me
the
wheel
miss
understand
this
is
business
you
bet
and
you
jest
the
right
woman
he
motioned
me
on
urged
by
a
sort
of
spell
i
remounted
my
machine
and
rode
out
of
the
village
he
followed
on
the
of
his
cab
then
when
we
had
left
the
world
well
behind
and
stood
among
the
boles
of
the
he
opened
the
door
mysteriously
and
produced
from
the
vehicle
a
very
bicycle
it
was
clumsy
to
look
at
it
differed
immensely
in
many
particulars
from
any
machine
i
had
yet
seen
or
ridden
the
strenuous
american
fondled
it
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
as
if
it
were
a
pet
child
then
he
mounted
nimbly
pride
shone
in
his
eye
i
saw
in
a
second
he
was
a
fond
inventor
he
rode
a
few
yards
on
next
he
turned
to
me
eagerly
he
said
in
an
impressive
voice
an
eccentric
like
all
his
countrymen
he
laid
most
stress
on
unaccented
syllables
i
knew
you
were
an
eccentric
i
said
moment
i
set
eyes
upon
you
he
surveyed
me
gravely
misunderstand
me
miss
he
corrected
i
say
an
eccentric
i
mean
a
crank
are
much
the
same
thing
i
answered
briskly
i
confess
i
would
hardly
have
applied
so
rude
a
word
as
to
you
he
looked
me
over
suspiciously
as
if
i
were
trying
to
make
game
of
him
but
my
face
was
so
he
brought
the
machine
a
yard
or
two
nearer
and
explained
its
construction
to
me
he
was
quite
right
it
driven
by
a
crank
it
had
no
chain
but
was
moved
by
a
pedal
working
narrowly
up
and
down
and
attached
to
a
rigid
bar
which
impelled
the
wheels
by
means
of
an
eccentric
besides
this
it
had
a
curious
device
for
altering
the
gearing
automatically
while
one
rode
so
as
to
enable
one
to
adapt
it
to
the
varying
slope
in
mounting
hills
this
part
of
the
mechanism
he
explained
to
me
elaborately
there
was
a
gauge
in
front
which
allowed
one
to
sight
the
steepness
of
the
slope
by
mere
inspection
and
according
as
the
gauge
marked
one
two
three
or
four
as
its
gradient
on
the
scale
the
rider
pressed
a
button
on
the
with
his
left
hand
once
twice
thrice
or
four
times
so
that
the
gearing
adapted
itself
without
an
effort
to
the
rise
in
the
surface
besides
there
were
devices
for
rigidity
and
compensation
altogether
it
was
a
most
apt
and
ingenious
piece
of
mechanism
i
did
not
wonder
he
was
proud
of
it
up
and
ride
miss
he
said
in
a
persuasive
voice
i
did
as
i
was
bid
to
my
immense
surprise
i
ran
up
the
steep
hill
as
smoothly
and
easily
as
if
it
were
a
level
nicely
does
she
hitchcock
murmured
rubbing
his
hands
i
answered
could
ride
such
a
machine
up
mont
blanc
i
should
fancy
he
stroked
his
chin
with
nervous
fingers
ought
to
knock
he
said
in
an
eager
voice
geared
to
run
up
most
anything
in
creation
steep
foot
in
three
good
it
climb
mount
washington
do
you
call
it
i
asked
he
looked
me
over
with
close
scrutiny
amurrica
he
said
slowly
call
it
the
great
manitou
because
it
kin
do
pretty
well
what
it
chooses
but
in
europe
i
am
thinking
of
calling
it
the
martin
conway
or
the
whymper
or
something
like
that
so
because
it
a
famous
mountain
climber
see
i
said
such
a
machine
you
put
a
notice
on
the
matterhorn
this
hill
is
dangerous
to
cyclists
he
laughed
low
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
hands
again
do
miss
he
said
the
right
sort
you
are
the
moment
i
seen
you
i
thought
we
two
could
do
a
trade
together
benefits
me
benefits
you
a
mutual
advantage
reciprocity
is
the
soul
of
business
you
hev
some
go
in
you
you
hev
there
money
in
your
feet
you
give
these
meinherrs
fits
you
take
the
out
of
them
fail
to
catch
on
i
answered
speaking
his
own
dialect
to
humour
him
you
get
there
all
the
same
he
replied
stroking
his
machine
meanwhile
was
a
squirrel
it
was
he
pronounced
it
run
up
a
tree
ef
it
wanted
would
it
he
was
talking
to
it
now
as
if
it
were
a
dog
or
a
baby
there
it
must
kick
it
was
a
frisky
little
thing
jest
you
step
up
on
it
miss
and
have
a
go
at
that
there
mountain
i
stepped
up
and
had
a
the
machine
bounded
forward
like
an
agile
greyhound
you
had
but
to
touch
it
and
it
ran
of
itself
never
had
i
ridden
so
vivacious
so
animated
a
cycle
i
returned
to
him
sailing
with
the
gradient
reversed
the
manitou
glided
smoothly
as
on
a
gentle
slope
without
the
need
for
soars
he
remarked
with
enthusiasm
are
at
discount
beside
it
i
answered
you
want
to
know
about
this
business
i
guess
he
went
on
want
to
know
jest
where
the
reciprocity
comes
in
anyhow
am
ready
to
hear
you
expound
i
admitted
smiling
it
ai
all
on
one
side
he
continued
eyeing
his
machine
at
an
angle
with
parental
affection
to
make
your
fortune
right
here
you
shall
ride
her
for
me
on
the
last
day
and
ef
you
pull
this
thing
off
do
you
be
scared
that
i
wo
treat
you
handsome
you
were
a
little
more
succinct
i
said
gravely
should
get
forrader
faster
you
wonder
he
put
in
with
money
on
it
like
this
i
should
intrust
the
job
the
hands
of
a
female
i
winced
but
was
silent
it
like
this
do
you
see
ef
a
female
wins
it
makes
success
all
the
more
striking
and
the
world
ruled
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
hitchcock
i
said
with
dignity
have
the
remotest
idea
what
on
earth
you
are
talking
about
he
gazed
at
me
with
surprise
he
exclaimed
at
last
you
kin
cycle
like
that
not
know
what
all
the
cycling
world
is
mad
about
why
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
you
not
a
i
enlightened
him
at
once
as
to
my
position
in
society
which
was
respectable
if
not
lucrative
his
face
fell
somewhat
eh
still
you
run
all
the
same
would
you
he
inquired
for
what
i
asked
innocently
the
presidency
the
frankfort
town
council
he
had
difficulty
in
fathoming
the
depths
of
my
ignorance
but
by
degrees
i
understood
him
it
seemed
that
the
german
imperial
and
prussian
royal
governments
had
offered
a
kaiserly
and
kingly
prize
for
the
best
military
bicycle
the
course
to
be
run
over
the
taunus
from
frankfort
to
limburg
the
winning
machine
to
get
the
equivalent
of
a
thousand
pounds
each
firm
to
supply
its
own
make
and
rider
the
day
was
saturday
next
and
the
great
manitou
was
the
dark
horse
of
the
contest
then
all
was
clear
as
day
to
me
cyrus
hitchcock
was
keeping
his
machine
a
profound
secret
he
wanted
a
woman
to
ride
it
so
that
his
triumph
might
be
the
more
complete
and
the
moment
he
saw
me
pedal
up
the
hill
in
trying
to
avoid
him
he
recognised
at
once
that
i
was
that
woman
i
recognised
it
too
was
a
harmony
after
two
or
three
trials
i
felt
that
the
manitou
was
built
for
me
and
i
was
built
for
the
manitou
we
ran
together
like
parts
of
one
mechanism
i
was
always
famed
for
my
circular
and
in
this
new
machine
was
everything
strength
of
limb
counted
for
naught
what
told
was
the
power
of
up
again
promptly
i
possess
that
power
i
have
prehistoric
feet
my
remote
progenitors
must
certainly
have
been
monkeys
we
arranged
terms
then
and
there
accept
if
i
pulled
off
the
race
i
was
to
have
fifty
pounds
if
i
did
i
was
to
have
five
ai
only
your
skill
you
see
hitchcock
said
with
frank
commercialism
your
personal
attractiveness
as
well
that
i
go
upon
that
an
element
to
consider
in
business
relations
face
is
my
fortune
i
answered
gravely
he
nodded
acquiescence
till
saturday
then
i
was
free
meanwhile
i
trained
and
practised
quietly
with
the
manitou
in
sequestered
parts
of
the
hills
i
also
took
spells
turn
about
at
the
stÃ¤del
institute
i
like
to
intersperse
culture
and
athletics
i
know
something
about
athletics
and
hope
in
time
to
acquire
a
taste
for
culture
is
expected
of
a
girton
girl
though
my
own
accomplishments
run
rather
towards
rowing
punting
bicycling
on
saturday
i
confess
i
rose
with
great
misgivings
i
was
not
a
professional
and
to
find
oneself
practically
backed
for
a
thousand
pounds
in
a
race
against
men
is
a
trifle
disquieting
still
having
once
put
my
hand
to
the
plough
i
felt
i
was
bound
to
pull
it
through
somehow
i
dressed
my
hair
neatly
in
a
very
tight
coil
i
ate
a
light
breakfast
eschewing
the
fried
sausages
which
the
blighted
fraus
pressed
upon
my
notice
and
satisfying
myself
with
a
egg
and
some
toast
and
coffee
i
always
found
i
rowed
best
at
cambridge
on
the
lightest
diet
in
my
opinion
the
raw
beef
is
a
serious
error
in
training
at
a
minute
or
two
before
eleven
i
turned
up
at
the
schiller
platz
in
my
short
serge
dress
and
cycling
jacket
the
great
square
was
thronged
with
spectators
to
see
us
start
the
police
made
a
lane
through
their
midst
for
the
riders
my
backer
had
advised
me
to
come
to
the
post
as
late
as
possible
i
have
entered
your
name
he
said
as
lois
cayley
these
deutschers
do
think
but
what
you
a
man
and
a
brother
but
i
am
apprehensive
of
when
you
put
in
a
show
they
try
to
raise
objections
to
you
on
account
of
your
being
a
female
there
wo
be
much
time
though
and
i
shall
rush
the
objections
once
they
let
you
run
and
win
it
do
matter
to
me
whether
i
get
the
twenty
thousand
marks
or
not
it
the
that
tells
jest
you
mark
my
words
miss
and
do
you
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
world
is
governed
by
so
i
turned
up
at
the
last
moment
and
cast
a
timid
glance
at
my
competitors
they
were
all
men
of
course
and
two
of
them
were
german
officers
in
a
sort
of
undress
cycling
uniform
they
eyed
me
superciliously
one
of
them
went
up
and
spoke
to
the
herr
who
had
charge
of
the
contest
i
understood
him
to
be
lodging
an
objection
against
a
mere
woman
taking
part
in
the
race
the
herr
a
bulky
official
came
up
beside
me
and
perpended
visibly
he
bent
his
big
brows
to
it
was
appalling
to
observe
the
measurable
amount
of
teutonic
cerebration
going
on
under
cover
of
his
round
green
glasses
he
was
perpending
for
some
minutes
time
was
almost
up
then
he
turned
to
hitchcock
having
finally
made
up
his
colossal
mind
and
murmured
rudely
woman
can
not
compete
not
i
inquired
in
my
very
sweetest
german
with
an
angelic
smile
though
my
heart
trembled
nicht
because
the
word
rider
in
the
kaiserly
and
kingly
decree
is
distinctly
in
the
masculine
gender
stated
me
herr
i
replied
pulling
out
a
copy
of
law
on
the
subject
with
which
i
had
duly
provided
myself
you
will
to
section
of
the
your
attention
turn
you
will
find
it
therein
expressly
enacted
that
unless
any
clause
be
anywhere
to
the
contrary
inserted
the
word
rider
in
the
masculine
gender
put
shall
here
the
word
rideress
in
the
feminine
to
embrace
be
considered
for
anticipating
this
objection
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
look
the
legal
question
up
beforehand
is
true
the
herr
observed
in
a
musing
voice
gazing
down
at
me
with
relenting
eyes
masculine
habitually
embraces
the
feminine
and
he
brought
his
massive
intellect
to
bear
upon
the
problem
once
more
with
prodigious
concentration
i
seized
my
opportunity
me
start
at
least
i
urged
holding
out
the
act
i
win
you
can
the
matter
more
fully
with
the
kaiserly
and
kingly
governments
hereafter
argue
out
guess
this
will
be
an
international
affair
hitchcock
remarked
well
pleased
would
be
a
for
the
great
manitou
ef
england
and
germany
were
to
make
the
question
into
a
the
united
states
could
look
on
and
pocket
the
chestnuts
minutes
to
go
the
official
starter
with
the
watch
called
out
in
then
frÃ¤ulein
englÃ¤nderin
the
herr
observed
without
prejudice
waving
me
into
line
he
pinned
a
badge
with
a
large
number
on
my
dress
kaiserly
and
kingly
governments
shall
on
the
affair
of
the
starting
legality
hereafter
on
my
report
more
at
leisure
pass
judgment
the
lieutenant
in
undress
uniform
drew
back
a
little
if
this
is
to
be
woman
play
he
muttered
can
a
prussian
officer
himself
by
competing
not
into
contempt
bring
i
dropped
a
little
curtsy
the
herr
lieutenant
is
afraid
even
to
against
an
englishwoman
i
said
smiling
he
came
up
to
the
scratch
sullenly
minute
to
go
called
out
the
starter
we
were
all
on
the
alert
there
was
a
pause
a
deep
breath
i
was
horribly
frightened
but
i
tried
to
look
calm
then
sharp
and
quick
came
the
one
word
and
like
arrows
from
a
bow
off
we
all
started
i
had
ridden
over
the
whole
course
the
day
but
one
before
on
a
mountain
pony
with
an
observant
eye
and
my
sedulous
american
rising
at
five
so
as
not
to
excite
undue
attention
and
i
therefore
knew
beforehand
the
exact
route
we
were
to
follow
but
i
confess
when
i
saw
the
prussian
lieutenant
and
one
of
my
other
competitors
dash
forward
at
a
pace
that
simply
astonished
me
that
fifty
pounds
seemed
to
melt
away
in
the
dim
abyss
of
the
ewigkeit
i
gave
up
all
for
lost
i
could
never
make
the
running
against
such
practised
cyclists
illustration
do
scorch
miss
do
scorch
however
we
all
turned
out
into
the
open
road
which
leads
across
the
plain
and
down
the
main
valley
in
the
direction
of
mayence
for
the
first
ten
miles
or
so
it
is
a
dusty
level
the
surface
is
perfect
but
a
blinding
white
thread
as
i
toiled
along
it
that
broiling
june
day
i
could
hear
the
voice
of
my
backer
who
followed
on
horseback
exhorting
me
in
loud
tones
scorch
miss
do
scorch
never
mind
ef
you
lose
sight
of
keep
your
wind
that
the
point
the
wind
the
wind
everything
let
beat
you
on
the
level
you
catch
up
fast
enough
when
you
get
on
the
taunus
but
in
spite
of
his
encouragement
i
almost
lost
heart
as
i
saw
one
after
another
of
my
opponents
backs
disappear
in
the
distance
till
at
last
i
was
left
toiling
along
the
bare
white
road
alone
in
a
of
sunlight
with
just
a
dense
cloud
of
dust
rising
gray
far
ahead
of
me
my
head
swam
it
repented
me
of
my
boldness
then
the
riders
on
horseback
began
to
grumble
for
by
police
regulation
they
were
not
allowed
to
pass
the
hindmost
of
the
cyclists
and
they
were
kept
back
by
my
presence
from
following
up
their
special
champions
it
up
frÃ¤ulein
give
it
up
they
cried
beaten
let
us
pass
and
get
forward
but
at
the
moment
i
heard
the
shrill
voice
of
my
american
friend
whooping
aloud
across
the
din
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
miss
you
stick
to
it
and
keep
your
wind
it
the
wind
that
wins
them
germans
wo
be
worth
a
cent
on
the
high
slopes
anyway
encouraged
by
his
voice
i
worked
steadily
on
neither
scorching
nor
relaxing
but
maintaining
an
even
pace
at
my
natural
pitch
under
the
broiling
sunshine
heat
rose
in
waves
on
my
face
from
the
road
below
in
the
thin
white
dust
the
accusing
tracks
of
six
wheels
confronted
me
still
i
kept
on
following
them
till
i
reached
the
town
of
hÃ¶chst
nine
miles
from
frankfort
soldiers
along
the
route
were
timing
us
at
intervals
with
chronometers
and
noting
our
numbers
as
i
rattled
over
the
paved
high
street
i
called
aloud
to
one
of
them
far
ahead
the
last
man
he
shouted
back
minutes
frÃ¤ulein
again
i
lost
heart
then
i
mounted
a
slight
slope
and
felt
how
easily
the
manitou
moved
up
the
gradient
from
its
summit
i
could
note
a
long
gray
cloud
of
dust
rolling
steadily
onward
down
the
hill
towards
hattersheim
i
coasted
down
with
my
feet
up
and
a
slight
breeze
just
cooling
me
hitchcock
behind
called
out
from
his
seat
hurry
no
flurry
take
your
time
take
your
time
miss
over
the
bridge
at
hattersheim
you
turn
to
the
right
abruptly
and
begin
to
mount
by
the
side
of
a
pretty
little
stream
the
schwarzbach
which
runs
brawling
over
rocks
down
the
taunus
from
eppstein
by
this
time
the
excitement
had
somewhat
cooled
down
for
the
moment
i
was
getting
reconciled
to
be
beaten
on
the
level
and
began
to
realise
that
my
chances
would
be
best
as
we
approached
the
steepest
bits
of
the
mountain
road
about
niederhausen
so
i
positively
plucked
up
heart
to
look
about
me
and
enjoy
the
scenery
with
hair
flying
behind
that
coil
had
played
me
false
i
swept
through
hofheim
a
pleasant
little
village
at
the
mouth
of
a
grassy
valley
inclosed
by
wooded
slopes
the
schwarzbach
making
cool
music
in
the
glen
below
as
i
mounted
beside
it
clambering
larches
like
huge
candelabra
stood
out
on
the
ridge
silhouetted
against
the
skyline
far
ahead
the
last
man
i
cried
to
the
recording
soldier
he
answered
me
back
minutes
frÃ¤ulein
i
was
gaining
on
them
i
was
gaining
i
thundered
across
the
schwarzbach
by
clamorous
little
iron
bridges
making
easy
time
now
and
with
my
feet
working
as
if
they
were
themselves
an
integral
part
of
the
machinery
up
up
up
it
looked
a
vertical
ascent
the
manitou
glided
well
in
its
at
its
gearing
i
rode
for
dear
life
at
sixteen
miles
lorsbach
at
eighteen
eppstein
the
road
still
rising
far
ahead
the
last
man
round
the
corner
frÃ¤ulein
i
put
on
a
little
steam
sure
enough
round
the
corner
i
caught
sight
of
his
back
with
a
spurt
i
passed
him
a
soul
very
hot
and
uncomfortable
he
had
not
kept
his
wind
i
flew
past
him
like
a
whirlwind
but
oh
how
sultry
hot
in
that
sweltering
close
valley
a
pretty
little
town
eppstein
with
its
mediÃ¦val
castle
perched
high
on
a
craggy
rock
i
owed
it
some
gratitude
i
felt
as
i
left
it
behind
for
here
that
i
came
up
with
the
of
my
opponents
that
one
victory
cheered
me
so
far
our
route
had
lain
along
the
but
dusty
high
road
in
the
steaming
valley
at
two
miles
on
we
quitted
the
road
abruptly
by
the
course
marked
out
for
us
and
turned
up
a
mountain
path
only
wide
enough
for
two
cycles
abreast
a
path
that
clambered
towards
the
higher
slopes
of
the
taunus
that
was
arranged
on
purpose
for
this
was
no
show
but
a
practical
trial
for
military
bicycles
under
the
conditions
they
might
meet
with
in
actual
warfare
it
was
rugged
riding
black
walls
of
pine
rose
steep
on
either
hand
the
ground
was
uncertain
our
path
mounted
sharply
from
the
first
the
steeper
the
better
by
the
time
i
had
reached
nestling
high
among
i
had
distanced
all
but
two
of
my
opponents
it
was
cooler
now
too
as
i
passed
the
hamlet
my
cry
altered
illustration
how
far
ahead
the
first
man
far
ahead
the
first

minutes
frÃ¤ulein
civilian
no
a
prussian
officer
the
herr
lieutenant
led
then
for
old
england
sake
i
felt
i
must
beat
him
the
steepest
slope
of
all
lay
in
the
next
two
miles
if
i
were
going
to
win
i
must
pass
these
two
there
for
my
advantage
lay
all
in
the
climb
if
it
came
to
coasting
the
men
mere
weight
scored
a
point
in
their
favour

jolt
i
pedalled
away
like
a
machine
the
manitou
sobbed
my
ankles
flew
round
so
that
i
scarcely
felt
them
but
the
road
was
rough
and
scarred
with
waterways
ruts
turned
by
rain
to
runnels
at
half
a
mile
after
a
desperate
struggle
among
sand
and
pebbles
i
passed
the
second
man
just
ahead
the
prussian
officer
looked
round
and
saw
me
you
there
englÃ¤nderin
he
cried
darting
me
a
look
of
unchivalrous
dislike
such
as
only
your
sentimental
german
can
cast
at
a
woman
illustration
i
am
here
behind
you
herr
lieutenant
i
am
here
behind
you
herr
lieutenant
i
answered
putting
on
a
spurt
i
hope
next
to
be
before
you
he
answered
not
a
word
but
worked
his
hardest
so
did
i
he
bent
forward
i
sat
erect
on
my
manitou
pulling
hard
at
my
handles
now
my
front
wheel
was
upon
him
it
reached
his
pedal
we
were
abreast
he
had
a
narrow
thread
of
solid
path
and
he
forced
me
into
a
runnel
still
i
gained
he
swerved
i
think
he
tried
to
foul
me
but
the
slope
was
too
steep
his
attempt
recoiled
on
himself
he
ran
against
the
rock
at
the
side
and
almost
overbalanced
that
second
lost
him
i
waved
my
hand
as
i
sailed
ahead
morning
i
cried
gaily
you
again
at
limburg
from
the
top
of
the
slope
i
put
my
feet
up
and
flew
down
into
idstein
a
burst
i
was
glad
of
the
cool
of
it
it
laid
the
dust
i
regained
the
high
road
from
that
moment
save
for
the
risk
of
sideslips
was
easy
running
just
an
undulating
line
with
occasional
ups
and
downs
but
i
saw
no
more
of
my
pursuers
till
kilometres
farther
on
i
rattled
on
the
causeway
into
limburg
i
had
covered
the
miles
in
quick
time
for
a
mountain
climb
as
i
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
lahn
to
my
immense
surprise
hitchcock
waved
his
arms
all
excitement
to
greet
me
he
had
taken
the
train
on
from
eppstein
it
seemed
and
got
there
before
me
as
i
dismounted
at
the
cathedral
which
was
our
appointed
end
and
gave
my
badge
to
the
soldier
he
rushed
up
and
shook
my
hand
pounds
he
cried
pounds
how
that
for
the
great
race
and
hooray
for
the
manitou
the
second
man
the
civilian
rode
in
wet
and
draggled
forty
seconds
later
as
for
the
herr
lieutenant
a
disappointed
man
he
fell
out
by
the
way
alleging
a
puncture
i
believe
he
was
ashamed
to
admit
the
fact
that
he
had
been
beaten
in
open
fight
by
the
objurgated
englÃ¤nderin
so
the
end
of
it
was
i
was
now
a
woman
of
means
with
fifty
pounds
of
my
own
to
my
credit
i
lunched
with
my
backer
royally
at
the
best
inn
in
limburg
iv
the
adventure
of
the
amateur
commission
agent
my
eccentric
american
had
assured
me
that
if
i
won
the
great
race
for
him
i
need
not
be
lest
he
should
fail
to
treat
me
well
and
to
do
him
justice
i
must
admit
that
he
kept
his
word
magnanimously
while
we
sat
at
lunch
in
the
cosy
hotel
at
limburg
he
counted
out
and
paid
me
in
hand
the
fifty
good
gold
pieces
he
had
promised
me
these
deutschers
fork
out
my
twenty
thousand
marks
or
not
he
said
in
his
brisk
way
do
much
matter
i
shall
get
the
contract
and
i
shall
hev
gotten
the
do
you
start
your
bicycles
in
germany
though
i
asked
innocently
should
have
thought
myself
there
was
so
much
a
better
chance
of
selling
them
in
england
illustration
let
them
boom
or
bust
on
it
he
closed
one
eye
and
looked
abstractedly
at
the
light
through
his
glass
of
pale
yellow
brauneberger
with
the
other
yes
england
well
see
miss
you

not
been
raised
in
business
business
is
business
the
way
to
do
it
in
germany
is
to
manufacture
for
yourself
and
i
got
my
works
started
right
here
in
frankfort
the
way
to
do
it
in
england
where
capital
dirt
cheap
is
to
sell
your
patent
for
every
cent
it
worth
to
an
english
company
and
let
them
boom
or
bust
on
it
see
i
said
catching
at
it
principle
as
clear
as
mud
the
moment
you
point
it
out
to
one
an
english
company
will
pay
you
well
for
the
concession
and
work
for
a
smaller
return
on
its
investment
than
you
americans
are
content
to
receive
on
your
capital
so
you
hit
it
in
one
miss
which
will
you
take
a
cigar
or
a
i
smiled
what
do
you
think
you
will
call
the
machine
in
europe
he
gazed
hard
at
me
and
stroked
his
moustache
what
do
think
of
the
heaven
sake
no
i
cried
fervently
hitchcock
i
implore
you
he
smiled
pity
for
my
weakness
again
he
repeated
as
if
it
were
some
natural
malformation
under
which
i
laboured
ef
you
do
like
it
miss
we
say
no
more
about
it
i
am
a
gentleman
i
am
what
the
matter
with
the
except
that
it
very
bad
latin
i
objected
may
be
so
but
it
very
good
business
he
paused
and
mused
then
he
murmured
low
to
himself
when
through
an
alpine
village
passed
that
where
the
idea
of
the
comes
in
see
it
goes
up
mont
blanc
you
said
yourself
through
snow
and
ice
a
cycle
with
the
strange
device
excelsior
i
were
you
i
said
would
stick
to
the
name
original
and
it
distinctive
so
then
chalk
it
up
the
thing
done
you
may
not
be
aware
of
it
miss
but
you
are
a
lady
for
whose
opinion
in
such
matters
i
hev
a
high
regard
you
understand
europe
i
do
not
i
admit
it
everything
seems
to
me
to
be
in
germany
and
everything
else
to
be
in
england
we
walked
down
the
steps
together
a
picturesque
old
town
i
said
looking
round
me
well
pleased
its
beauty
appealed
to
me
for
i
had
fifty
pounds
in
pocket
and
i
had
lunched
sumptuously
town
he
repeated
gazing
with
a
blank
stare
call
this
town
do
you
of
course
just
look
at
the
cathedral
eight
hundred
years
old
at
least
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
streets
dissatisfied
ef
this
town
is
old
he
said
at
last
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
precious
little
for
its
age
and
he
strode
away
towards
the
railway
station
about
the
bicycle
i
asked
for
it
lay
a
silent
victor
against
the
railing
of
the
steps
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
inquiring
teutons
he
glanced
at
it
carelessly
the
wheel
he
said
may
keep
it
he
said
it
so
exactly
in
the
tone
in
which
one
tells
a
waiter
he
may
keep
the
change
that
i
resented
the
impertinence
thank
you
i
answered
do
not
require
it
he
gazed
at
me
put
my
foot
in
it
again
he
interposed
enough
eh
now
i
do
regret
it
no
offence
meant
miss
nor
none
need
be
taken
what
i
meant
to
was
this
you
hev
won
the
big
race
for
me
folks
will
notice
you
and
talk
about
you
at
frankfort
ef
you
ride
a
manitou
that
make
talk
the
more
a
mutual
advantage
benefits
you
benefits
me
you
get
the
wheel
i
get
the
i
saw
that
reciprocity
was
the
lodestar
of
his
life
well
hitchcock
i
said
pocketing
my
pride
accept
the
machine
and
i
ride
it
then
a
light
dawned
upon
me
i
saw
eventualities
here
i
went
on
innocently
recollect
i
was
a
girl
just
fresh
from
girton
am
thinking
of
going
on
very
soon
to
switzerland
now
why
should
i
do
this
try
to
sell
your
machines
or
rather
take
orders
for
them
from
anybody
that
admires
them
a
mutual
advantage
benefits
you
benefits
me
you
sell
your
wheels
i
get
he
stared
at
me
commission
do
know
what
commission
means
i
answered
somewhat
at
sea
as
to
the
name
i
thought
it
might
be
worth
your
while
till
the
manitou
becomes
better
known
to
pay
me
say
ten
per
cent
on
all
orders
i
brought
you
his
face
was
one
broad
smile
do
admire
at
you
miss
he
cried
standing
still
to
inspect
me
may
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
commission
but
durned
ef
you
have
got
a
hang
of
the
itself
that
would
do
honour
to
a
wall
street
operator
anyway
that
business
i
asked
eagerly
for
i
beheld
vistas
he
repeated
that
jest
about
the
size
of
it
business
miss
may
be
the
soul
of
commerce
but
commission
its
body
you
go
in
and
win
ten
per
cent
on
every
order
you
send
me
he
insisted
on
taking
my
ticket
back
to
frankfort
affair
miss
my
affair
there
was
no
gainsaying
him
he
was
immensely
elated
biggest
thing
in
cycles
since
dunlop
tyres
he
repeated
they
give
me
advertizements
gratis
in
every
newspaper
next
morning
he
came
round
to
call
on
me
at
the
abode
of
unclaimed
domestic
angels
he
was
explicit
and
generous
here
miss
he
began
did
do
fair
by
you
when
you
interviewed
me
about
your
agency
last
evening
i
took
advantage
the
time
your
youth
and
inexperience
you
suggested
per
cent
the
amount
of
your
commission
on
sales
you
might
effect
and
i
jumped
at
it
that
was
conduct
unworthy
a
gentleman
now
i
will
not
deceive
you
the
ordinary
commission
on
transactions
in
wheels
is
per
cent
i
am
going
to
sell
the
manitou
retail
at
twenty
english
pounds
apiece
you
shall
hev
your
per
cent
on
all
orders
pounds
for
every
machine
i
sell
i
exclaimed
overjoyed
he
nodded
so
i
was
simply
amazed
at
this
magnificent
prospect
cycle
trade
must
be
honeycombed
with
middlemen
profits
i
cried
for
i
had
my
misgivings
so
he
replied
again
jest
you
take
and
be
a
middlewoman
as
a
consistent
socialist
is
your
duty
to
fleece
the
capitalist
and
the
consumer
a
mutual
benefit
triangular
this
time
i
get
the
order
the
public
gets
the
machine
and
you
get
the
commission
i
am
richer
you
are
richer
and
the
public
is
mounted
on
much
the
best
wheel
ever
yet
invented
sounds
plausible
i
admitted
shall
try
it
on
in
switzerland
i
shall
run
up
steep
hills
whenever
i
see
any
likely
customers
looking
on
then
i
shall
stop
and
ask
them
the
time
as
if
quite
accidentally
he
rubbed
his
hands
take
to
business
like
a
young
duck
to
the
water
he
exclaimed
admiringly
the
way
to
rake
in
you
go
up
and
say
to
them
why
not
investigate
we
defy
competition
leave
the
drudgery
of
walking
uphill
beside
your
cycle
progress
is
the
order
of
the
day
use
modern
methods
this
is
the
age
of
the
telegraph
the
telephone
the
typewriter
you
kin
no
longer
afford
to
go
on
with
an
antiquated
wheel
invest
in
a
the
last
and
lightest
product
of
evvolootion
it
to
buy
an
unautomatic
inconvertible
machine
when
for
the
same
money
or
less
you
can
purchase
the
manitou
a
priceless
gem
as
light
as
a
feather
with
all
the
most
recent
additions
and
improvements
be
reasonable
get
the
best
that
the
style
to
fetch
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
hitchcock
i
burst
out
not
style
at
all
i
shall
say
simply
this
is
a
lovely
new
bicycle
you
can
see
for
yourself
how
it
climbs
hills
try
it
if
you
wish
it
skims
like
a
swallow
and
i
get
what
they
call
five
pounds
commission
on
every
one
i
can
sell
of
them
i
think
that
way
of
dealing
is
much
more
likely
to
bring
you
in
orders
his
admiration
was
undisguised
i
call
you
a
woman
of
business
miss
he
cried
see
it
at
a
glance
that
so
the
right
kind
of
thing
to
rope
in
the
europeans
some
originality
about
you
you
take
on
their
own
ground
you
got
the
draw
on
them
you
hev
i
like
your
system
you
jest
haul
in
the
dollars
hope
so
i
said
fervently
for
i
had
evolved
in
my
own
mind
oh
such
a
scheme
for
elsie
petheridge
holidays
he
gazed
at
me
once
more
only
i
could
get
hold
of
a
woman
of
business
like
you
to
soar
through
life
with
me
he
murmured
illustration
his
open
admiration
was
getting
quite
embarrassing
i
grew
interested
in
my
shoes
his
open
admiration
was
getting
quite
embarrassing
he
paused
a
minute
then
he
went
on
what
do
you
say
to
it
what
i
asked
amazed
my
proposition
my
offer
i
do
understand
i
stammered
out
bewildered
per
cent
you
mean
the
of
a
lifetime
he
answered
looking
sideways
at
me
cayley
when
a
business
man
advances
a
proposition
commercial
or
otherwise
he
advances
it
because
he
means
it
he
asks
a
prompt
reply
your
time
is
valuable
so
is
mine
you
prepared
to
consider
it
hitchcock
i
said
drawing
back
think
you
misunderstand
i
think
you
do
not
realise
right
miss
he
answered
promptly
though
with
a
disappointed
air
it
kin
not
be
managed
it
kin
not
be
managed
i
understand
your
european
i
know
your
prejudices
but
this
little
episode
need
not
antagonise
with
the
normal
course
of
ordinary
business
i
respect
you
miss
cayley
you
are
a
lady
intelligence
initiative
and
culture
i
will
wish
you
good
day
for
the
present
without
further
words
and
i
shall
be
happy
at
any
time
to
receive
your
orders
on
the
usual
commission
he
backed
out
and
was
gone
he
was
so
honestly
blunt
that
i
really
quite
liked
him
next
day
i
bade
a
tearless
farewell
to
the
blighted
fraus
when
i
told
those
eight
phlegmatic
souls
i
was
going
they
all
said
much
as
they
had
said
to
every
previous
remark
i
had
been
moved
to
make
to
them
is
capital
garnishing
but
viewed
as
a
staple
of
conversation
i
find
it
a
trifle
vapid
not
to
say
monotonous
i
set
out
on
my
wanderings
therefore
to
go
round
the
world
on
my
own
account
and
my
own
manitou
which
last
i
grew
to
love
in
time
with
a
love
passing
the
love
of
cyrus
hitchcock
i
carried
the
strict
necessary
before
me
in
a
small
waterproof
bicycling
valise
but
i
sent
on
the
portmanteau
containing
my
whole
estate
real
or
personal
to
some
point
in
advance
which
i
hoped
to
reach
from
time
to
time
in
a
day
or
two
my
first
day
journey
was
along
a
pleasant
road
from
frankfort
to
heidelberg
some
miles
in
all
skirting
the
mountains
the
greater
part
of
the
way
the
manitou
took
the
ups
and
downs
so
easily
that
i
diverged
at
intervals
to
choose
over
the
wooded
hills
i
arrived
at
heidelberg
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
my
mount
not
having
turned
a
hair
meanwhile
a
favourite
expression
of
cyclists
which
carries
all
the
more
conviction
to
an
impartial
mind
because
of
the
machine
being
obviously
hairless
thence
i
journeyed
on
by
easy
stages
to
karlsruhe
baden
appenweier
and
offenburg
where
i
set
my
front
wheel
resolutely
for
the
black
forest
it
is
the
prettiest
and
most
picturesque
route
to
switzerland
and
being
also
the
hilliest
it
would
afford
me
i
thought
the
best
opportunity
for
showing
off
the
paces
and
trying
my
prentice
hand
as
an
amateur
from
the
quaint
little
black
eagle
at
offenburg
however
before
i
dashed
into
the
forest
i
sent
off
a
letter
to
elsie
petheridge
setting
forth
my
lovely
scheme
for
her
summer
holidays
she
was
delicate
poor
child
and
the
london
winters
sorely
tried
her
i
was
now
a
millionaire
with
the
better
part
of
fifty
pounds
in
pocket
so
i
felt
i
could
afford
to
be
royal
in
my
hospitality
as
i
was
leaving
frankfort
i
had
called
at
a
tourist
agency
and
bought
a
circular
ticket
from
london
to
lucerne
and
back
i
made
it
because
i
am
opposed
on
principle
to
excessive
luxury
and
also
because
it
was
three
guineas
cheaper
even
fifty
pounds
will
not
last
for
ever
though
i
could
scarce
believe
it
you
see
i
am
not
wholly
free
after
all
from
the
besetting
british
vice
of
prudence
it
was
a
mighty
joy
to
me
to
be
able
to
send
this
ticket
to
elsie
at
her
lodgings
in
bayswater
pointing
out
to
her
that
now
the
whole
mischief
was
done
and
that
if
she
would
not
come
out
as
soon
as
her
summer
vacation
began
was
a
point
of
honour
with
elsie
to
say
instead
of
to
join
me
at
lucerne
and
stop
with
me
as
my
guest
at
a
mountain
the
ticket
would
be
wasted
i
love
burning
my
boats
is
the
only
safe
way
for
securing
prompt
action
then
i
turned
my
flying
wheels
up
into
the
black
forest
growing
weary
of
my
loneliness
for
it
is
not
all
jam
to
ride
by
oneself
in
germany
and
longing
for
elsie
to
come
out
and
join
me
i
loved
to
think
how
her
dear
pale
cheeks
would
gain
colour
and
tone
on
the
hills
about
the
brÃ¼nig
where
for
business
reasons
so
i
said
to
myself
with
the
conscious
pride
of
the
commission
agent
i
proposed
to
pass
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
from
offenburg
to
hornberg
the
road
makes
a
good
stiff
climb
of
miles
and
some
english
feet
in
altitude
with
a
fair
number
of
minor
undulations
on
the
way
to
diversify
it
i
will
not
describe
the
route
though
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
travelled
rocky
hills
ruined
castles
huge
pines
that
clamber
up
green
slopes
or
halt
in
sombre
line
against
steeps
of
broken
crag
the
reality
surpasses
my
poor
powers
of
description
and
the
people
i
passed
on
the
road
were
almost
as
quaint
and
picturesque
in
their
way
as
the
hills
and
the
villages
the
men
in
jackets
the
women
in
black
petticoats
green
bodices
and
straw
hats
with
pompons
but
on
the
steepest
gradient
just
before
reaching
hornberg
i
got
my
first
nibble
strange
to
say
from
two
german
students
they
wore
heidelberg
caps
and
were
toiling
up
the
incline
with
short
broken
wind
i
put
on
a
spurt
with
the
manitou
and
passed
them
easily
i
did
it
just
at
first
in
pure
wantonness
of
health
and
strength
but
the
moment
i
was
clear
of
them
it
occurred
to
the
business
half
of
me
that
here
was
a
good
chance
of
taking
an
order
filled
with
this
bright
idea
i
dismounted
near
the
summit
and
pretended
to
be
engaged
in
lubricating
my
bearings
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
manitou
runs
in
a
bath
of
oil
and
needs
no
looking
after
presently
my
two
heidelbergers
straggled
up
hot
dusty
panting
i
pretended
to
take
no
notice
one
of
them
drew
near
and
cast
an
eye
on
the
manitou
a
new
machine
frÃ¤ulein
he
said
at
last
with
more
politeness
than
i
expected
is
i
answered
casually
latest
model
climbs
hills
like
no
other
and
i
feigned
to
mount
and
glide
off
towards
hornberg
a
moment
pray
frÃ¤ulein
my
prospective
buyer
called
out
heinrich
i
wish
you
this
new
so
excellent
machine
without
chain
propelled
more
fully
to
investigate
am
going
on
to
hornberg
i
said
with
mixed
feminine
guile
and
commercial
strategy
if
your
friend
wishes
to
look
illustration
minute
inspection
they
both
jostled
round
it
with
innumerable
and
after
minute
inspection
pronounced
its
principle
i
essay
it
heinrich
asked
by
all
means
i
answered
he
paced
it
down
hill
a
few
yards
then
skimmed
up
again
is
a
bird
he
cried
to
his
friend
with
many
guttural
interjections
the
eagle
flight
so
soars
it
come
try
the
thing
ludwig
permit
frÃ¤ulein
i
nodded
they
both
mounted
it
several
times
it
behaved
like
a
beauty
then
one
of
them
asked
where
can
man
of
this
new
so
remarkable
machine
nearest
by
purchase
himself
make
possessor
am
the
sole
agent
i
burst
out
with
swelling
dignity
you
will
give
me
your
orders
with
cash
in
hand
for
the
amount
i
will
send
the
cycle
carriage
paid
to
any
address
you
desire
in
germany
they
exclaimed
incredulously
frÃ¤ulein
is
pleased
to
be
humorous
very
well
i
answered
vaulting
into
the
saddle
you
choose
to
doubt
my
word
i
waved
one
careless
hand
and
coasted
off
meine
herren
they
lumbered
after
me
on
their
ramshackled
frÃ¤ulein
do
not
thus
go
away
oblige
us
at
least
with
the
name
and
address
of
the
maker
i
perpended
like
the
herr
at
frankfort
here
i
said
at
last
telling
the
truth
with
frankness
get
per
cent
on
all
bicycles
i
sell
i
am
as
i
say
the
maker
sole
agent
if
you
order
through
me
i
touch
my
profit
if
otherwise
i
do
not
still
since
you
seem
to
be
gentlemen
they
bowed
and
swelled
visibly
will
give
you
the
address
of
the
firm
trusting
to
your
honour
to
mention
my
name
i
handed
them
a
card
you
decide
on
ordering
the
price
of
the
palfrey
is
marks
it
is
worth
every
pfennig
of
it
and
before
they
could
say
more
i
had
spurred
my
steed
and
swept
off
at
full
speed
round
a
curve
of
the
highway
i
pencilled
a
note
to
my
american
that
night
from
hornberg
detailing
the
circumstance
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
for
the
discredit
of
humanity
that
when
those
two
students
wrote
the
same
evening
from
their
inn
in
the
village
to
order
manitous
they
did
mention
my
name
doubtless
under
the
misconception
that
by
suppressing
it
they
would
save
my
commission
however
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
add
as
we
say
in
business
that
when
i
arrived
at
lucerne
a
week
or
so
later
i
found
a
letter
from
cyrus
hitchcock
inclosing
an
english
note
he
wrote
that
he
had
received
two
orders
for
manitous
from
hornberg
and
considerable
confidence
that
these
must
necessarily
originate
from
my
german
students
he
had
the
pleasure
of
forwarding
me
what
he
hoped
would
be
the
first
of
many
similar
commissions
illustration
felt
a
perfect
little
hypocrite
i
will
not
describe
my
further
adventures
on
the
still
steeper
mountain
road
from
hornberg
to
triberg
and
georgen
how
i
got
bites
on
the
way
from
an
english
curate
an
austrian
hussar
and
two
unprotected
american
ladies
nor
how
i
angled
for
them
all
by
riding
my
machine
up
impossible
hills
and
then
reclining
gracefully
to
eat
my
lunch
three
times
in
one
day
on
mossy
banks
at
the
summit
i
felt
a
perfect
little
hypocrite
but
hitchcock
had
remarked
that
business
is
business
and
i
will
only
add
in
confirmation
of
his
view
that
by
the
time
i
reached
lucerne
i
had
sown
the
good
seed
in
fifteen
separate
human
souls
no
less
than
four
of
which
brought
forth
fruit
in
orders
for
manitous
before
the
end
of
the
season
i
had
now
so
little
fear
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
that
i
settled
down
in
a
comfortable
hotel
at
lucerne
till
elsie
holidays
began
and
amused
myself
meanwhile
by
picking
out
the
hilliest
roads
i
could
find
in
the
neighbourhood
in
order
to
display
my
steel
possibilities
to
the
best
advantage
by
the
end
of
july
elsie
joined
me
she
was
at
first
that
i
should
have
forced
the
ticket
and
my
hospitality
upon
her
dear
i
said
smoothing
her
hair
for
her
pale
face
quite
frightened
me
is
the
good
of
a
friend
if
she
will
not
allow
you
to
do
her
little
favours
brownie
you
said
you
would
stop
and
be
dependent
upon
one
day
longer
than
was
necessary
in
london
was
different
i
cried
was
me
this
is
you
i
am
a
great
strong
healthy
thing
fit
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
and
take
care
of
myself
you
elsie
are
one
of
those
fragile
little
flowers
which
is
everybody
duty
to
protect
and
to
care
for
she
would
have
protested
more
but
i
stifled
her
mouth
with
kisses
indeed
for
nothing
did
i
rejoice
in
my
prosperity
so
much
as
for
the
chance
it
gave
me
of
helping
poor
dear
overworked
overwrought
elsie
we
took
up
our
quarters
thenceforth
at
a
little
near
the
top
of
the
brÃ¼nig
it
was
bracing
for
elsie
and
it
lay
close
to
a
tourist
track
where
i
could
spread
my
snares
and
exhibit
the
manitou
in
its
true
colours
to
many
passing
visitors
elsie
tried
it
and
found
she
could
ride
on
it
with
ease
she
wished
she
had
one
of
her
own
a
bright
idea
struck
me
in
fear
and
trembling
i
wrote
suggesting
to
hitchcock
that
i
had
a
girl
friend
from
england
stopping
with
me
in
switzerland
and
that
two
manitous
would
surely
be
better
than
one
as
an
i
confess
i
stood
aghast
at
my
own
cheek
but
my
hand
i
fear
was
rapidly
growing
to
that
it
worked
in
anyhow
i
sent
the
letter
off
and
waited
developments
by
return
of
post
came
an
answer
from
my
american
miss
by
rail
herewith
please
receive
one
lady
no
automatic
manitou
as
per
your
esteemed
favour
of
july
for
which
i
desire
to
thank
you
the
more
i
see
of
your
way
of
doing
business
the
more
i
do
admire
at
you
this
is
an
elegant
poster
two
english
ladies
mounted
on
manitous
careering
up
the
alps
represent
to
both
of
us
quite
a
mint
of
money
the
mutual
benefit
to
me
to
you
and
to
the
other
lady
ought
to
be
simply
incalculable
i
shall
be
pleased
at
any
time
to
hear
of
any
further
developments
of
your
very
remarkable
advertising
skill
and
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
this
brilliant
suggestion
you
have
been
good
enough
to
make
to
respectfully
w
hitchcock
am
i
to
have
it
for
nothing
brownie
elsie
exclaimed
bewildered
when
i
read
the
letter
to
her
i
assumed
the
airs
of
a
woman
of
the
world
certainly
my
dear
i
answered
as
if
i
always
expected
to
find
bicycles
showered
upon
me
a
mutual
arrangement
benefits
him
benefits
you
reciprocity
is
the
groundwork
of
business
gets
the
advertisement
get
the
amusement
it
a
form
of
handbill
like
the
ladies
who
exhibit
their
back
hair
do
you
know
in
that
window
in
regent
street
thus
inexpensively
mounted
we
scoured
the
country
together
up
the
steepest
hills
between
stanzstadt
and
meiringen
we
had
lots
of
nibbles
one
lady
in
particular
often
stopped
to
look
on
and
admire
the
manitou
she
was
a
widow
of
very
fresh
and
a
evelegh
we
soon
found
out
who
owned
a
charming
on
the
hills
above
lungern
she
spoke
to
us
more
than
once
a
perfect
dear
of
a
machine
she
cried
wonder
if
i
dare
try
it
you
cycle
i
asked
could
once
she
answered
was
awfully
fond
of
it
but
wo
let
me
any
longer
it
i
said
dismounting
she
got
up
and
rode
is
it
just
lovely
she
cried
ecstatically
one
i
put
in
as
smooth
as
silk
they
cost
only
twenty
pounds
and
on
every
machine
i
sell
i
get
five
pounds
commission
should
love
to
she
answered
is
he
i
asked
do
believe
in
she
looked
quite
shocked
he
not
that
kind
you
know
she
put
in
breathlessly
the
celebrated
esoteric
he
let
me
move
far
away
from
lungern
though
i
longing
to
be
off
to
england
again
for
the
summer
my
boy
at
portsmouth
why
do
you
disobey
him
her
face
was
a
study
dare
she
answered
in
an
voice
comes
here
every
summer
and
he
does
me
much
good
you
know
he
diagnoses
my
inner
self
he
treats
me
psychically
when
my
inner
self
goes
wrong
my
bangle
turns
dusky
she
held
up
her
right
hand
with
an
indian
silver
bangle
on
it
and
sure
enough
it
was
tarnished
with
a
very
thin
black
deposit
soul
is
ailing
now
she
said
in
a
comically
serious
voice
it
is
seldom
so
in
switzerland
the
moment
i
land
in
england
the
bangle
turns
black
and
remains
black
till
i
get
back
to
lucerne
again
when
she
had
gone
i
said
to
elsie
odd
about
the
bangle
state
of
health
might
affect
it
i
suppose
though
it
looks
to
me
like
a
surface
deposit
of
sulphide
i
knew
nothing
of
chemistry
i
admit
but
i
had
sometimes
messed
about
in
the
laboratory
at
college
with
some
of
the
other
girls
and
i
remembered
now
that
sulphide
of
silver
was
a
body
like
the
film
on
the
bangle
however
at
the
time
i
thought
no
more
about
it
illustration
she
invited
elsie
and
myself
to
stop
with
her
by
dint
of
stopping
and
talking
we
soon
got
quite
intimate
with
evelegh
as
always
happens
i
found
out
i
had
known
some
of
her
cousins
in
edinburgh
where
i
always
spent
my
holidays
while
i
was
at
girton
she
took
an
interest
in
what
she
was
kind
enough
to
call
my
originality
and
before
a
fortnight
was
out
our
hotel
being
uncomfortably
crowded
she
had
invited
elsie
and
myself
to
stop
with
her
at
the
we
went
and
found
it
a
delightful
little
home
evelegh
was
charming
but
we
could
see
at
every
turn
that
had
acquired
a
firm
hold
over
her
so
clever
you
know
she
said
so
spiritual
he
exercises
such
strong
odylic
force
he
binds
my
being
together
if
he
misses
a
visit
i
feel
my
inner
self
goes
all
to
pieces
he
come
often
i
asked
growing
interested
dear
no
she
answered
wish
he
did
it
would
be
ever
so
good
for
me
but
he
so
much
run
after
i
am
but
one
among
many
he
lives
at
chÃ¢teau
and
comes
across
to
see
patients
in
this
district
once
a
fortnight
it
is
a
privilege
to
be
attended
by
an
intuitive
seer
like
dr
evelegh
was
rich
comfortably
as
the
phrase
goes
but
with
a
clause
which
prevented
her
marrying
again
without
losing
her
fortune
and
i
could
gather
from
various
hints
that
whoever
he
might
be
was
bleeding
her
to
some
tune
using
her
soul
and
her
inner
self
as
his
financial
lancet
i
also
noticed
that
what
she
said
about
the
bangle
was
strictly
true
generally
bright
as
a
new
pin
on
certain
mornings
it
was
completely
blackened
i
had
been
at
the
ten
days
however
before
i
began
to
suspect
the
real
reason
then
it
dawned
upon
me
one
morning
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
the
evening
before
had
been
cold
for
at
the
height
where
we
were
perched
even
in
august
we
often
found
the
temperature
chilly
in
the
night
and
i
heard
evelegh
tell
cÃ©cile
her
maid
to
fill
the
bottle
it
was
a
small
point
but
it
somehow
went
home
to
me
next
day
the
bangle
was
black
and
evelegh
lamented
that
her
inner
self
must
be
suffering
from
an
attack
of
evil
vapours
i
held
my
peace
at
the
time
but
i
asked
cÃ©cile
a
little
later
to
bring
me
that
as
i
more
than
half
suspected
it
was
made
of
wrapped
carefully
up
in
the
usual
red
flannel
bag
me
your
brooch
elsie
i
said
want
to
try
a
little
experiment
a
franc
do
as
well
elsie
asked
tendering
one
equally
silver
think
not
i
answered
franc
is
most
likely
too
hard
it
has
base
metal
to
alloy
it
but
i
will
vary
the
experiment
by
trying
both
together
your
brooch
is
indian
and
therefore
soft
silver
the
native
jewellers
never
use
alloy
hand
it
over
it
will
clean
with
a
little
if
necessary
i
going
to
see
what
blackens
evelegh
bangle
i
laid
the
franc
and
the
brooch
on
the
bottle
filled
with
hot
water
and
placed
them
for
warmth
in
the
fold
of
a
blanket
after
we
inspected
them
as
i
anticipated
the
brooch
had
grown
black
on
the
surface
with
a
thin
iridescent
layer
of
silver
sulphide
while
the
franc
had
hardly
suffered
at
all
from
the
exposure
i
called
in
evelegh
and
explained
what
i
had
done
she
was
astonished
and
half
incredulous
could
you
ever
think
of
it
she
cried
admiringly
i
was
reading
an
article
yesterday
about
in
one
of
your
magazines
i
answered
the
person
who
wrote
it
said
the
raw
gum
was
hardened
for
vulcanising
by
mixing
it
with
sulphur
when
i
heard
you
ask
cÃ©cile
for
the
i
thought
at
once
the
sulphur
and
the
heat
account
for
the
tarnishing
of
evelegh
bangle
the
franc
does
tarnish
then
that
must
be
why
my
other
silver
bracelet
which
is
english
make
and
harder
never
changes
colour
and
assured
me
it
was
because
the
soft
one
was
of
indian
metal
and
had
mystic
symbols
on
it
symbols
that
answered
to
the
cardinal
moods
of
my
self
and
that
darkened
in
sympathy
i
jumped
at
a
clue
talked
about
your
self
i
broke
in
she
answered
always
does
it
the
of
his
system
he
heals
by
that
alone
but
my
dear
after
this
how
can
i
ever
believe
in
him
he
know
about
the
i
asked
yes
he
ordered
me
to
use
it
on
certain
nights
and
when
i
go
to
england
he
says
i
must
never
be
without
one
i
see
now
that
was
why
my
inner
self
invariably
went
wrong
in
england
it
was
all
just
the
sulphur
blackening
the
bangles
i
reflected
man
i
asked
with
wrinkles
round
his
eyes
and
a
distinguished
grey
moustache
twirled
up
oddly
at
the
corners
the
man
my
dear
his
very
picture
where
on
earth
have
you
seen
him
he
talks
of
selves
i
went
on
practises
on
that
basis
he
says
it
no
use
prescribing
for
the
outer
man
to
do
that
is
to
treat
mere
symptoms
the
self
is
the
inner
seat
of
diseases
long
has
he
been
in
switzerland
he
comes
here
every
year
he
arrived
this
season
late
in
may
i
fancy
will
he
visit
you
again
mrs
evelegh
morning
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
i
must
see
him
without
being
seen
i
said
think
i
know
him
he
is
our
count
i
believe
for
i
had
told
evelegh
and
elsie
the
queer
story
of
my
journey
from
london
my
dear
i
have
implicit
faith
in
him
and
see
evelegh
you
acknowledge
he
duped
you
over
the
affair
of
the
bangle
illustration
the
count
there
are
two
kinds
of
dupe
one
kind
the
commonest
goes
on
believing
in
its
deceiver
no
matter
what
happens
the
other
far
rarer
has
the
sense
to
know
it
has
been
deceived
if
you
make
the
deception
as
clear
as
day
to
it
evelegh
was
fortunately
of
the
rarer
class
next
morning
arrived
by
appointment
as
he
walked
up
the
path
i
glanced
at
him
from
my
window
it
was
the
count
not
a
doubt
of
it
on
his
way
to
gull
his
dupes
in
switzerland
he
had
tried
to
throw
in
an
incidental
trifle
of
a
diamond
robbery
i
telegraphed
the
facts
at
once
to
lady
georgina
at
schlangenbad
she
answered
am
coming
ask
the
man
to
meet
his
friend
on
wednesday
evelegh
now
almost
convinced
invited
him
on
wednesday
morning
with
a
bounce
lady
georgina
burst
in
upon
us
dear
such
a
journey
alone
at
my
age
but
there
i
have
known
a
happy
day
since
you
left
me
oh
yes
i
got
my
gretchen
unsophisticated
well
h
that
not
the
word
for
it
i
declare
to
you
lois
there
is
a
trick
of
the
trade
in
paris
or
london
not
a
perquisite
or
a
tip
that
that
girl
is
up
to
comes
straight
from
the
remotest
recesses
of
the
black
forest
and
had
been
with
me
a
week
i
assure
you
honour
bright
before
she
was
bandolining
her
yellow
hair
and
rouging
her
cheeks
and
wearing
my
brooches
and
wagering
gloves
with
the
hotel
waiters
upon
the
baden
races
her
language
her
manners
why
were
you
born
in
that
station
of
life
i
wonder
child
so
that
i
might
offer
you
five
hundred
a
year
and
all
found
to
come
and
live
with
me
for
ever
but
this
gretchen
her
fringe
her
shoes
her
ribbons
upon
my
soul
my
dear
i
do
know
what
girls
are
coming
to
nowadays
i
suggested
as
she
paused
is
a
recognised
authority
on
the
subject
the
cantankerous
old
lady
stared
at
me
this
count
she
went
on
you
have
really
tracked
him
you
a
wonderful
girl
my
dear
i
wish
you
were
a
lady
maid
you
be
worth
me
any
money
i
explained
how
i
had
come
to
hear
of
lady
georgina
waxed
warm
she
exclaimed
wicked
wretch
but
he
did
get
my
diamonds
i
carried
them
here
in
my
hands
all
the
way
from
wiesbaden
i
was
going
to
leave
them
for
a
single
day
to
the
tender
mercies
of
that
unspeakable
gretchen
the
fool
would
lose
them
well
we
catch
him
this
time
lois
and
give
him
ten
years
for
it
years
evelegh
cried
clasping
her
hands
in
horror
lady
georgina
we
waited
in
evelegh
the
old
lady
and
i
behind
the
folding
doors
at
three
precisely
walked
in
i
had
difficulty
in
restraining
lady
georgina
from
falling
upon
him
prematurely
he
talked
a
lot
of
nonsense
to
evelegh
and
elsie
about
the
influences
of
the
planets
and
the
emanations
and
the
eternal
wisdom
of
the
east
and
the
medical
efficacy
of
suggestion
excellent
patter
all
of
it
quite
as
good
in
its
way
as
the
diplomatic
patter
he
had
poured
forth
in
the
train
to
lady
georgina
it
was
rich
in
spheres
in
elements
in
cosmic
forces
at
last
as
he
was
discussing
the
reciprocal
action
of
the
inner
self
upon
the
exhalations
of
the
lungs
we
pushed
back
the
door
and
walked
calmly
in
upon
him
his
breath
came
and
went
the
exhalations
of
the
lungs
showed
visible
perturbation
he
rose
and
stared
at
us
for
a
second
he
lost
his
composure
then
as
bold
as
brass
he
turned
with
a
cunning
smile
to
evelegh
on
earth
did
you
pick
up
such
acquaintances
he
inquired
in
a
tone
of
surprise
lady
georgina
i
have
met
you
before
i
admit
but
it
can
hardly
be
agreeable
to
you
to
reflect
under
what
circumstances
lady
georgina
was
beside
herself
dare
she
cried
confronting
him
dare
to
brazen
it
out
you
miserable
sneak
but
you
bluff
me
now
i
have
the
police
outside
which
i
regret
to
confess
was
a
fiction
police
he
echoed
drawing
back
i
could
see
he
was
frightened
i
had
an
inspiration
again
off
that
moustache
i
said
calmly
in
my
most
commanding
voice
illustration
i
thought
it
kinder
to
him
to
remove
it
altogether
he
clapped
his
hand
to
it
in
horror
in
his
agitation
he
managed
to
pull
it
a
little
bit
awry
it
looked
so
absurd
hanging
there
all
crooked
that
i
thought
it
kinder
to
him
to
remove
it
altogether
the
thing
peeled
off
with
difficulty
for
it
was
a
work
of
art
very
firmly
and
gracefully
fastened
with
but
it
peeled
off
at
last
and
with
it
the
whole
of
the
count
and
distinction
the
man
stood
revealed
a
very
palpable
lady
georgina
stared
hard
at
him
have
i
seen
you
before
she
murmured
slowly
face
is
familiar
to
me
why
yes
you
went
once
to
italy
as
marmaduke
ashurst
courier
i
know
you
now
your
name
is
higginson
it
was
a
for
the
comte
de
but
he
swallowed
it
like
a
man
at
a
single
gulp
my
lady
he
said
fingering
his
hat
nervously
now
all
was
up
are
quite
right
my
lady
but
what
would
you
have
me
do
times
are
hard
on
us
couriers
nobody
wants
us
now
i
must
take
to
what
i
can
he
assumed
once
more
the
tone
of
the
vienna
diplomat
madame
these
are
revolutionary
days
a
man
of
intelligence
must
move
with
the
zeitgeist
lady
georgina
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
to
think
she
cried
i
talked
to
this
lackey
from
london
to
malines
without
ever
suspecting
him
higginson
you
a
fraud
but
you
a
precious
clever
one
he
bowed
am
happy
to
have
merited
lady
georgina
commendation
he
answered
with
his
palm
on
his
heart
in
his
grandiose
manner
i
shall
hand
you
over
to
the
police
all
the
same
you
are
a
thief
and
a
swindler
he
assumed
a
comic
expression
not
a
thief
he
objected
young
lady
prevented
me
from
appropriating
your
diamonds
the
wise
call
it
i
wanted
to
take
your
and
she
put
me
off
with
a
i
wanted
to
make
an
honest
penny
out
of
evelegh
and
she
confronts
me
with
your
ladyship
and
tears
my
moustache
off
lady
georgina
regarded
him
with
a
hesitating
expression
i
shall
call
the
police
she
said
wavering
visibly
my
lady
is
it
worth
while
si
peu
de
consider
i
have
really
effected
nothing
will
you
charge
me
with
having
taken
in
error
a
small
tin
value
elevenpence
an
affair
of
a
week
imprisonment
that
is
positively
all
you
can
bring
up
against
me
and
brightening
up
visibly
have
the
case
still
i
will
return
it
with
pleasure
to
your
ladyship
the
i
put
in
have
been
deceiving
evelegh
it
blackens
silver
and
you
told
her
lies
in
order
to
extort
money
under
false
pretences
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
are
too
clever
for
me
young
lady
he
broke
out
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
but
lady
georgina
evelegh
you
are
human
let
me
go
reflect
i
have
things
i
could
tell
that
would
make
both
of
you
look
ridiculous
that
journey
to
malines
lady
georgina
those
indian
charms
evelegh
besides
you
have
spoiled
my
game
let
that
suffice
you
i
can
practise
in
switzerland
no
longer
allow
me
to
go
in
peace
and
i
will
try
once
more
to
be
indifferent
honest
illustration
inch
by
inch
he
retreated
he
backed
slowly
towards
the
door
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
them
i
stood
by
and
waited
inch
by
inch
he
retreated
lady
georgina
looked
down
abstractedly
at
the
carpet
evelegh
looked
up
abstractedly
at
the
ceiling
neither
spoke
another
word
the
rogue
backed
out
by
degrees
then
he
sprang
downstairs
and
before
they
could
decide
was
well
out
into
the
open
lady
georgina
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
all
my
dear
she
murmured
turning
to
me
was
a
deal
of
sound
english
about
dogberry
i
remembered
then
his
charge
to
the
watch
to
apprehend
a
rogue
if
will
not
stand
then
take
no
note
of
him
but
let
him
go
and
presently
call
the
rest
of
the
watch
together
and
thank
god
you
are
rid
of
a
knave
when
i
remembered
how
lady
georgina
had
with
the
count
from
ostend
to
malines
i
agreed
to
a
great
extent
both
with
her
and
with
dogberry
v
the
adventure
of
the
impromptu
mountaineer
the
explosion
and
evaporation
of
with
whom
were
amalgamated
the
comte
de
higginson
the
courier
and
whatever
else
that
versatile
gentleman
chose
to
call
himself
entailed
many
results
of
varying
magnitudes
in
the
first
place
evelegh
ordered
a
great
manitou
that
however
mattered
little
to
firm
as
i
loved
to
call
us
because
it
shocked
dear
elsie
so
for
of
course
after
all
her
kindness
we
accept
our
commission
on
her
purchase
so
that
she
got
her
machine
cheap
for
from
the
maker
but
in
the
second
place
i
declare
i
am
beginning
to
write
like
a
woman
of
business
she
decided
to
run
over
to
england
for
the
summer
to
see
her
boy
at
portsmouth
being
certain
now
that
the
discoloration
of
her
bangle
depended
more
on
the
presence
of
sulphur
in
the
bottle
than
on
the
passing
state
of
her
astral
body
is
an
abrupt
descent
from
the
inner
self
to
a
bottle
i
admit
but
evelegh
took
the
plunge
with
grace
like
a
sensible
woman
had
been
annihilated
for
her
at
one
blow
she
returned
forthwith
to
and
england
will
you
do
with
the
while
you
away
lady
georgina
asked
when
she
announced
her
intention
ca
shut
it
up
to
take
care
of
itself
every
blessed
thing
in
the
place
will
go
to
rack
and
ruin
shutting
up
a
house
means
spoiling
it
for
ever
why
i
got
a
cottage
of
my
own
that
i
let
for
the
summer
in
the
best
part
of
surrey
a
pretty
little
place
now
vacant
for
which
by
the
way
i
want
a
tenant
if
you
happen
to
know
of
one
and
when
it
left
empty
for
a
month
or
two
it
would
do
for
me
evelegh
suggested
jumping
at
it
looking
out
for
a
furnished
house
for
the
summer
within
easy
reach
of
portsmouth
and
london
for
myself
and
oliver
lady
georgina
seized
her
arm
with
a
face
of
blank
horror
dear
she
cried
you
i
would
dream
of
letting
it
to
you
a
nasty
damp
cold
unwholesome
house
on
stiff
clay
soil
with
detestable
drains
in
the
deadliest
part
of
the
weald
of
surrey
why
you
and
your
boy
would
catch
your
deaths
of
rheumatism
it
the
one
i
saw
advertised
in
the
this
morning
i
wonder
evelegh
inquired
in
a
placid
voice
charming
furnished
house
on
holmesdale
common
six
bedrooms
four
splendid
views
pure
air
picturesque
surroundings
exceptionally
situated
i
thought
of
writing
about
it
illustration
never
leave
a
house
to
the
servants
my
dear
it
lady
georgina
exclaimed
with
a
demonstrative
wave
of
her
hand
drew
up
the
advertisement
myself
exceptionally
situated
i
should
just
think
it
was
why
my
dear
i
would
let
you
rent
the
place
for
worlds
a
horrid
poky
little
hole
stuck
down
in
the
bottom
of
a
boggy
hollow
as
damp
as
devonshire
with
the
paper
peeling
off
the
walls
so
that
i
had
to
take
my
choice
between
giving
it
up
myself
ten
years
ago
or
removing
to
the
cemetery
and
i
let
it
ever
since
to
city
men
with
large
families
nothing
would
induce
me
to
allow
you
and
your
boy
to
expose
yourself
to
such
risks
for
lady
georgina
had
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
evelegh
what
i
was
just
going
to
say
was
this
you
ca
shut
your
house
up
it
all
go
mouldy
houses
always
go
mouldy
shut
up
in
summer
and
you
ca
leave
it
to
your
servants
know
the
baggages
no
conscience
no
conscience
they
ask
their
entire
families
to
come
and
stop
with
them
and
turn
your
place
into
a
perfect
piggery
why
when
i
went
away
from
my
house
in
town
one
autumn
did
i
leave
a
policeman
and
his
wife
in
charge
a
most
respectable
man
only
he
happened
to
be
an
irishman
and
what
was
the
consequence
my
dear
i
assure
you
i
came
back
unexpectedly
from
poor
dear
kynaston
one
day
at
a
moment
notice
having
quarrelled
with
him
over
home
rule
or
education
or
something
poor
dear
what
they
call
a
liberal
i
believe
got
at
by
that
man
rosebery
and
there
did
i
find
all
the
and
and
in
the
neighbourhood
camping
out
in
my
with
a
strong
detachment
of
and
and
lying
around
loose
in
possession
of
the
library
never
leave
a
house
to
the
servants
my
dear
it
positively
suicidal
put
in
a
responsible
caretaker
of
whom
you
know
something
like
lois
here
for
instance
evelegh
echoed
me
that
just
the
very
thing
what
a
capital
idea
i
never
thought
of
lois
she
and
elsie
might
stop
on
here
with
ursula
and
the
gardener
i
protested
that
if
we
did
it
was
our
clear
duty
to
pay
a
small
rent
but
evelegh
brushed
that
aside
robbed
yourselves
over
the
bicycle
she
insisted
i
delighted
to
let
you
have
it
it
i
who
ought
to
pay
for
you
keep
the
house
dry
for
me
i
remembered
hitchcock
advantage
benefits
you
benefits
me
and
made
no
bones
about
it
so
in
the
end
evelegh
set
off
for
england
with
cÃ©cile
leaving
elsie
and
me
in
charge
of
ursula
the
gardener
and
the
as
for
lady
georgina
having
by
this
time
completed
her
at
schlangenbad
complexion
as
usual
no
guinea
yellower
she
telegraphed
for
gretchen
ca
do
without
the
idiot
and
hung
round
lucerne
apparently
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
send
people
up
the
brÃ¼nig
on
the
hunt
for
our
wonderful
new
machines
and
so
put
money
in
our
pockets
she
was
much
amused
when
i
told
her
that
aunt
susan
who
lived
you
will
remember
in
respectable
indigence
at
blackheath
had
written
to
expostulate
with
me
on
my
conduct
in
becoming
a
bicycle
commission
agent
the
cantankerous
old
lady
exclaimed
with
warmth
does
the
woman
mean
has
she
got
no
gumption
ladylike
i
suppose
to
be
a
companion
or
a
governess
or
a
or
something
else
in
the
way
in
london
but
not
to
sell
bicycles
for
a
good
round
commission
my
dear
between
you
and
me
i
do
see
it
if
you
had
a
brother
now
might
sell
cycles
or
corner
wheat
or
rig
the
share
market
or
do
anything
else
he
pleased
in
these
days
and
nobody
think
the
worse
of
him
as
long
as
he
made
money
and
it
my
opinion
that
what
is
sauce
for
the
goose
ca
be
far
out
for
the
gander
and
besides
which
what
the
use
of
to
be
ladylike
you
a
lady
child
and
you
could
help
being
one
why
trouble
to
be
what
nature
made
you
tell
aunt
susan
from
me
to
put
in
her
pipe
and
smoke
it
i
tell
aunt
susan
by
letter
giving
lady
georgina
authority
for
the
statement
and
i
really
believe
it
had
a
consoling
effect
upon
her
for
aunt
susan
is
one
of
those
people
who
cherish
a
profound
respect
for
the
opinions
and
ideas
of
a
lady
of
title
especially
where
questions
of
delicacy
are
concerned
it
calmed
her
to
think
that
though
i
an
officer
daughter
had
declined
upon
trade
i
was
mixing
at
least
with
the
best
people
we
had
a
lovely
time
at
the
two
girls
alone
messing
just
as
we
pleased
in
the
kitchen
and
learning
from
ursula
how
to
concoct
in
the
most
approved
swiss
fashion
we
pottered
as
we
women
love
to
potter
half
the
day
long
the
other
half
we
spent
in
riding
our
cycles
about
the
eternal
hills
and
ensnaring
the
flies
whom
lady
georgina
dutifully
sent
up
to
us
she
was
our
decoy
duck
and
in
virtue
of
her
handle
she
decoyed
to
a
marvel
indeed
i
sold
so
many
manitous
that
i
began
to
entertain
a
deep
respect
for
my
own
commercial
faculties
as
for
cyrus
hitchcock
he
wrote
to
me
from
frankfort
world
continues
to
revolve
on
its
axis
the
manitou
and
the
machine
is
booming
orders
romp
in
daily
when
you
ventilated
the
suggestion
of
an
agency
at
limburg
i
concluded
at
a
glance
you
had
the
material
of
a
business
woman
about
you
but
i
reckon
i
did
not
know
what
a
traveller
meant
till
you
started
on
the
road
i
am
now
enlarging
and
altering
this
factory
to
meet
increased
demands
branch
offices
at
berlin
hamburg
crefeld
and
dÃ¼sseldorf
inspect
our
stock
before
dealing
elsewhere
a
liberal
discount
allowed
to
the
trade
two
hundred
agents
wanted
in
all
towns
of
germany
if
they
were
every
one
of
them
like
miss
well
i
guess
i
would
hire
the
town
of
frankfort
for
my
business
premises
one
morning
after
we
had
spent
about
a
week
at
the
by
ourselves
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
young
man
with
a
knapsack
on
his
back
walking
up
the
garden
path
towards
our
cottage
quick
elsie
i
cried
being
in
a
mischievous
mood
here
with
the
there
a
man
in
the
offing
elsie
exclaimed
shocked
as
usual
at
my
levity
man
i
answered
squeezing
her
arm
man
a
real
live
man
a
specimen
of
the
masculine
gender
in
the
human
being
man
ahoy
he
has
come
at
last
the
lodestar
of
our
existence
next
minute
i
was
sorry
i
spoke
for
as
the
man
drew
nearer
i
perceived
that
he
was
endowed
with
very
long
legs
and
a
languidly
poetical
bearing
that
supercilious
smile
that
enticing
moustache
could
it
be
yes
it
was
not
a
doubt
of
it
harold
tillington
i
grew
grave
at
once
harold
tillington
and
the
situation
were
serious
can
he
want
here
i
exclaimed
drawing
back
is
it
elsie
asked
for
being
a
woman
she
read
at
once
in
my
altered
demeanour
the
fact
that
the
man
was
not
unknown
to
me
georgina
nephew
i
answered
with
a
cheek
i
fear
remember
i
mentioned
to
you
that
i
had
met
him
at
schlangenbad
but
this
is
really
too
bad
of
that
wicked
old
lady
georgina
she
has
told
him
where
we
lived
and
sent
him
up
to
see
us
elsie
put
in
wants
to
charter
a
bicycle
i
glanced
at
elsie
sideways
i
had
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
she
said
it
slyly
like
one
who
knew
he
wanted
nothing
of
the
sort
but
at
any
rate
i
brushed
the
suggestion
aside
frankly
i
answered
wants
not
a
bicycle
he
came
up
to
us
waving
his
hat
he
look
handsome
miss
cayley
he
cried
from
afar
have
tracked
you
to
your
lair
i
have
found
out
where
you
abide
what
a
beautiful
spot
and
how
well
looking
is
an
unexpected
i
paused
he
thought
i
was
going
to
say
but
i
finished
it
his
face
fell
did
you
know
we
were
at
lungern
mr
tillington
respected
relative
he
answered
laughing
mentioned
casually
his
eyes
met
mine
you
were
stopping
in
a
and
as
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
the
diplomatic
mill
i
thought
i
might
just
as
well
walk
over
the
grimsel
and
the
furca
and
then
on
to
the
gotthard
the
court
is
at
monza
so
it
occurred
to
me
that
in
passing
i
might
venture
to
drop
in
and
say
to
you
you
i
answered
severely
but
my
heart
spoke
otherwise
do
very
well
and
you
mr
tillington
he
echoed
since
went
away
from
schlangenbad
i
gazed
at
his
dusty
feet
are
tramping
i
said
cruelly
suppose
you
will
get
forward
for
lunch
to
meiringen
i
did
not
contemplate
it
he
grew
bolder
to
say
the
truth
i
half
hoped
i
might
stop
and
spend
the
day
here
with
you
i
remarked
firmly
tillington
persists
in
planting
himself
upon
us
like
this
one
of
us
must
go
and
investigate
the
kitchen
department
elsie
rose
like
a
lamb
i
have
an
impression
that
she
gathered
we
wanted
to
be
left
alone
illustration
i
may
stay
may
i
he
turned
to
me
imploringly
he
cried
stretching
out
his
arms
with
an
appealing
air
stay
may
i
i
tried
to
be
stern
but
i
fear
was
a
feeble
pretence
are
two
girls
alone
in
a
house
i
answered
georgina
as
a
matron
of
experience
ought
to
have
protected
us
merely
to
give
you
lunch
is
almost
irregular
good
diplomatic
word
irregular
still
in
these
days
i
suppose
you
stay
if
you
leave
early
in
the
afternoon
that
the
utmost
i
can
do
for
you
are
not
gracious
he
cried
gazing
at
me
with
a
wistful
look
i
did
not
dare
to
be
gracious
guests
must
not
quarrel
with
their
welcome
i
answered
severely
then
the
woman
in
me
broke
forth
indeed
tillington
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
you
are
not
angry
with
me
lois
i
may
call
you
i
trembled
and
hesitated
am
not
angry
with
you
i
i
like
you
too
much
to
be
ever
angry
with
you
and
i
am
glad
you
came
just
this
once
to
see
me
yes
when
we
are
alone
you
may
call
me
lois
he
tried
to
seize
my
hand
i
withdrew
it
i
may
perhaps
hope
he
began
some
day
i
shook
my
head
no
i
said
regretfully
misunderstand
me
i
like
you
very
much
and
i
like
to
see
you
but
as
long
as
you
are
rich
and
have
prospects
like
yours
i
could
never
marry
you
my
pride
would
let
me
take
that
as
final
i
looked
away
he
bent
forward
again
if
i
were
poor
he
put
in
eagerly
i
hesitated
then
my
heart
rose
and
i
gave
way
ever
you
are
poor
i
faltered
hunted
friendless
come
to
me
harold
and
i
will
help
and
comfort
you
but
not
till
then
not
till
then
i
implore
you
he
leant
back
and
clasped
his
hands
have
given
me
something
to
live
for
dear
lois
he
murmured
will
try
to
be
poor
penniless
hunted
friendless
to
win
you
i
will
try
and
when
that
day
arrives
i
shall
come
to
claim
you
we
sat
for
an
hour
and
had
a
delicious
talk
about
nothing
but
we
understood
each
other
only
that
artificial
barrier
divided
us
at
the
end
of
the
hour
i
heard
elsie
coming
back
by
judiciously
slow
stages
from
the
kitchen
to
the
through
six
feet
of
passage
discoursing
audibly
to
ursula
all
the
way
with
a
tardiness
that
did
honour
to
her
heart
and
her
understanding
dear
kind
little
elsie
i
believe
she
had
never
a
tiny
romance
of
her
own
yet
her
sympathy
for
others
was
sweet
to
look
upon
we
lunched
at
a
small
deal
table
in
the
veranda
around
us
rose
the
pinnacles
the
scent
of
pines
and
moist
moss
was
in
the
air
elsie
had
arranged
the
flowers
and
got
ready
the
omelette
and
cooked
the
chicken
cutlets
and
prepared
the
junket
never
thought
i
could
do
it
alone
without
you
brownie
but
i
tried
and
it
all
came
right
by
magic
somehow
we
laughed
and
talked
incessantly
harold
was
in
excellent
cue
and
elsie
took
to
him
a
livelier
or
merrier
table
there
was
in
the
cantons
that
day
than
ours
under
the
sapphire
sky
looking
out
on
the
snows
of
the
jungfrau
after
lunch
harold
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
stop
for
tea
i
had
misgivings
but
i
gave
way
he
such
good
company
one
may
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
says
the
wisdom
of
our
ancestors
and
after
all
grundy
was
only
represented
here
by
elsie
the
gentlest
and
least
censorious
of
her
daughters
so
he
stopped
and
chatted
till
four
when
i
made
tea
and
insisted
on
dismissing
him
he
meant
to
take
the
rough
mountain
path
over
the
screes
from
lungern
to
meiringen
which
ran
right
behind
the
i
feared
lest
he
might
be
belated
and
urged
him
to
hurry
i
happier
here
he
answered
i
was
sternness
itself
me
i
said
in
a
reproachful
voice
he
rose
instantly
and
bowed
will
is
law
even
when
it
pronounces
sentence
of
exile
would
we
walk
a
little
way
with
him
no
i
faltered
we
would
not
we
would
follow
him
with
the
and
wave
him
farewell
when
he
reached
the
kulm
he
shook
our
hands
unwillingly
and
turned
up
the
little
path
looking
handsomer
than
ever
it
led
ascending
through
a
to
the
hillside
once
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
near
a
sharp
turn
in
the
road
after
that
we
waited
in
vain
with
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
kulm
not
a
sign
could
we
discern
of
him
at
last
i
grew
anxious
ought
to
be
there
i
cried
fuming
ought
elsie
answered
i
swept
the
slopes
with
the
anxiety
and
interest
in
him
quickened
my
senses
i
suppose
here
elsie
i
burst
out
at
last
take
this
glass
and
have
a
glance
at
those
birds
down
the
crag
below
the
kulm
do
they
seem
to
be
circling
and
behaving
most
oddly
elsie
gazed
where
i
bid
her
wheeling
round
and
round
she
answered
after
a
minute
they
certainly
look
as
if
they
were
screaming
seem
to
be
frightened
i
suggested
looks
like
it
brownie
he
fallen
over
a
precipice
i
cried
rising
up
he
lying
there
on
a
ledge
by
their
nest
elsie
we
must
go
to
him
she
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
terrified
brownie
how
dreadful
she
exclaimed
her
face
was
deadly
white
mine
burned
like
fire
a
moment
to
lose
i
said
holding
my
breath
out
the
rope
and
let
us
run
to
him
you
think
elsie
suggested
had
better
hurry
down
on
our
cycles
to
lungern
and
call
some
men
from
the
village
to
help
us
we
are
two
girls
and
alone
what
can
we
do
to
aid
him
i
answered
promptly
wo
do
it
would
only
lose
time
and
time
may
be
precious
you
and
i
must
go
i
send
ursula
off
to
bring
up
guides
from
the
village
fortunately
we
had
a
good
long
coil
of
new
rope
in
the
house
which
evelegh
had
provided
in
case
of
accident
i
slipped
it
on
my
arm
and
set
out
on
foot
for
the
path
was
by
far
too
rough
for
cycles
i
was
sorry
afterwards
that
i
had
not
taken
ursula
and
sent
elsie
to
lungern
to
rouse
the
men
for
she
found
the
climbing
hard
and
i
had
difficulty
at
times
in
dragging
her
up
the
steep
and
stony
pathway
almost
a
watercourse
however
we
persisted
in
the
direction
of
the
kulm
tracking
harold
by
his
footprints
for
he
wore
mountain
boots
with
nails
which
made
dints
in
the
moist
soil
and
scratched
the
smooth
surface
of
the
rock
where
he
trod
on
it
we
followed
him
thus
for
a
mile
or
two
along
the
regular
path
then
of
a
sudden
in
an
open
part
the
trail
failed
us
i
turned
back
a
few
yards
and
looked
close
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
spongy
soil
as
keen
as
a
hound
that
sniffs
his
way
after
his
quarry
went
off
elsie
i
said
at
last
pulling
up
short
by
a
spindle
bush
on
the
hillside
do
you
know
brownie
see
there
are
the
marks
of
his
stick
he
had
a
thick
one
you
remember
with
a
square
iron
spike
these
are
its
dints
i
have
been
watching
them
all
the
way
along
from
the
there
are
so
many
such
marks
i
know
i
can
tell
his
from
the
older
ones
made
by
the
spikes
of
alpenstocks
because
harold
are
fresher
and
sharper
on
the
edge
they
look
so
much
newer
see
here
he
slipped
on
the
rock
you
can
know
that
scratch
is
recent
by
the
clean
way
it
traced
and
the
little
glistening
crystals
still
left
behind
in
it
those
other
marks
have
been
and
washed
by
the
rain
there
are
no
broken
particles
on
earth
did
you
find
that
out
brownie
how
on
earth
did
i
find
it
out
i
wondered
myself
but
the
emergency
seemed
somehow
to
teach
me
something
of
the
instinctive
lore
of
hunters
and
savages
i
did
not
trouble
to
answer
her
this
bush
the
tracks
fail
i
went
on
look
he
must
have
clutched
at
that
branch
and
crushed
the
broken
leaves
as
the
twigs
slipped
through
his
fingers
he
left
the
path
here
then
and
struck
off
on
a
short
cut
of
his
own
along
the
hillside
lower
down
elsie
we
must
follow
him
she
shrank
from
it
but
i
held
her
hand
it
was
a
more
difficult
task
to
track
him
now
for
we
had
no
longer
the
path
to
guide
us
however
i
explored
the
ground
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
soon
found
marks
of
footsteps
on
the
boggy
patches
with
scratches
on
the
rock
where
he
had
leapt
from
point
to
point
or
planted
his
stick
to
steady
himself
i
tried
to
help
elsie
along
among
the
littered
boulders
and
the
dwarf
growth
of
daphne
but
poor
child
it
was
too
much
for
her
she
sat
down
after
a
few
minutes
upon
the
flat
juniper
scrub
and
began
to
cry
what
was
i
to
do
my
anxiety
was
breathless
i
could
leave
her
there
alone
and
i
could
forsake
harold
yet
i
felt
every
minute
might
now
be
critical
we
were
making
among
wet
whortleberry
thicket
and
torn
rock
towards
the
spot
where
i
had
seen
the
birds
wheel
and
circle
screaming
the
only
way
left
was
to
encourage
elsie
and
make
her
feel
the
necessity
for
instant
action
is
alive
still
i
exclaimed
looking
up
birds
are
crying
if
he
were
dead
they
would
return
to
their
nest
elsie
we
get
to
him
she
rose
bewildered
and
followed
me
i
held
her
hand
tight
and
coaxed
her
to
scramble
over
the
rocks
where
the
scratches
showed
the
way
or
to
clamber
at
times
over
fallen
trunks
of
huge
yet
it
was
hard
work
climbing
even
harold
sure
feet
had
slipped
often
on
the
wet
and
slimy
boulders
though
like
most
of
queen
margherita
set
he
was
an
expert
mountaineer
then
at
times
i
lost
the
faint
track
so
that
i
had
to
diverge
and
look
close
to
find
it
these
delays
fretted
me
a
stone
loosed
from
its
bed
he
must
have
passed
by
here
that
twig
is
newly
snapped
no
doubt
he
caught
at
it
ha
the
moss
there
has
been
crushed
a
foot
has
gone
by
and
the
ants
on
that
with
their
eggs
in
their
mouths
a
man
tread
has
frightened
them
so
by
some
instinctive
sense
as
if
the
spirit
of
my
savage
ancestors
revived
within
me
i
managed
to
recover
the
spoor
again
and
again
by
a
miracle
till
at
last
round
a
corner
by
a
defiant
cliff
with
a
terrible
foreboding
my
heart
stood
still
within
me
we
had
come
to
an
end
a
great
projecting
buttress
of
crag
rose
sheer
in
front
above
lay
loose
boulders
below
was
a
precipice
the
birds
we
had
seen
from
home
were
still
circling
and
screaming
they
were
a
pair
of
peregrine
hawks
their
nest
seemed
to
lie
far
below
the
broken
scar
some
sixty
or
seventy
feet
beneath
us
is
not
dead
i
cried
once
more
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
he
were
they
would
have
returned
he
has
fallen
and
is
lying
alive
below
there
illustration
i
advanced
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
elsie
shrank
back
against
the
wall
of
rock
i
advanced
on
my
hands
and
knees
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
it
was
not
quite
sheer
but
it
dropped
like
a
with
broken
ledges
i
could
see
where
harold
had
slipped
he
had
tried
to
climb
round
the
crag
that
blocked
the
road
and
the
ground
at
the
edge
of
the
precipice
had
given
way
with
him
it
showed
a
recent
founder
of
a
few
inches
then
he
clutched
at
a
branch
of
broom
as
he
fell
but
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
cutting
them
for
there
was
blood
on
the
wiry
stem
i
knelt
by
the
side
of
the
cliff
and
craned
my
head
over
i
scarcely
dared
to
look
in
spite
of
the
birds
my
heart
misgave
me
there
on
a
ledge
deep
below
he
lay
in
a
mass
half
raised
on
one
arm
but
not
dead
i
believed
i
cried
he
turned
his
face
up
and
saw
me
his
eyes
lighted
with
joy
he
shouted
back
something
but
i
could
not
hear
it
i
turned
to
elsie
must
go
down
to
him
her
tears
rose
again
brownie
i
unwound
the
coil
of
rope
the
first
thing
was
to
fasten
it
i
could
not
trust
elsie
to
hold
it
she
was
too
weak
and
too
frightened
to
bear
my
weight
even
if
i
wound
it
round
her
body
i
feared
my
mere
mass
might
drag
her
over
i
peered
about
at
the
surroundings
no
tree
grew
near
no
rock
had
a
pinnacle
sufficiently
safe
to
depend
upon
but
i
found
a
plan
soon
in
the
crag
behind
me
was
a
cleft
narrowing
as
it
descended
i
tied
the
end
of
the
rope
round
a
stone
a
good
big
stone
rudely
girdled
with
a
groove
near
the
middle
which
prevented
it
from
slipping
then
i
dropped
it
down
the
fissure
till
it
jammed
after
which
i
tried
it
to
see
if
it
would
bear
it
was
firm
as
the
rock
itself
i
let
the
rope
down
by
it
and
waited
a
moment
to
discover
whether
harold
could
climb
he
shook
his
head
and
took
a
notebook
with
evident
pain
from
his
pocket
then
he
scribbled
a
few
words
and
pinned
them
to
the
rope
i
hauled
it
up
move
either
severely
bruised
and
sprained
or
else
legs
broken
there
was
no
help
for
it
then
i
must
go
to
him
my
first
idea
was
merely
to
glide
down
the
rope
with
my
gloved
hands
for
i
chanced
to
have
my
bicycling
gloves
in
my
pocket
fortunately
however
i
did
not
carry
out
this
crude
idea
too
hastily
for
next
instant
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
not
swarm
up
again
i
have
had
no
practice
in
here
was
a
problem
but
the
moment
suggested
its
own
solution
i
began
making
knots
or
rather
nooses
or
loops
in
the
rope
at
intervals
of
about
eighteen
inches
are
they
for
elsie
asked
looking
on
in
wonder
to
climb
up
by
the
ones
above
will
pull
out
with
your
weight
do
think
so
still
to
make
sure
i
shall
tie
them
with
this
string
i
get
down
to
him
i
threaded
a
sufficient
number
of
loops
trying
the
length
over
the
edge
then
i
said
to
elsie
who
sat
cowering
propped
against
the
crag
must
come
and
look
over
and
do
as
i
wave
to
you
mind
dear
you
two
lives
depend
upon
it
i
dare
i
shall
turn
giddy
and
fall
over
i
smoothed
her
golden
hair
dear
i
said
gently
gazing
into
her
blue
eyes
are
a
woman
a
woman
can
always
be
brave
where
those
she
loves
are
concerned
and
i
believe
you
love
me
i
led
her
coaxingly
to
the
edge
there
i
said
in
my
quietest
voice
so
as
not
to
alarm
her
can
lie
at
full
length
if
you
like
and
only
just
peep
over
but
when
i
wave
my
hand
remember
you
must
pull
the
rope
up
she
obeyed
me
like
a
child
i
knew
she
loved
me
illustration
i
gripped
the
rope
and
let
myself
down
i
gripped
the
rope
and
let
myself
down
not
using
the
loops
to
descend
but
just
sliding
with
hands
and
knees
and
allowing
the
knots
to
slacken
my
pace
down
i
will
confess
the
eerie
feeling
of
physical
suspense
was
horrible
one
hung
so
in
the
hawks
flapped
their
wings
but
harold
was
below
and
a
woman
can
always
be
brave
where
those
she
loves
well
just
that
moment
catching
my
breath
i
knew
i
loved
harold
i
glided
down
swiftly
the
air
whizzed
at
last
on
a
narrow
shelf
of
rock
i
leant
over
him
he
seized
my
hand
knew
you
would
come
he
cried
felt
sure
you
would
find
out
though
you
found
out
heaven
only
knows
you
clever
brave
little
woman
you
terribly
hurt
i
asked
bending
close
his
clothes
were
torn
hardly
know
i
ca
move
it
may
only
be
bruises
you
climb
by
these
nooses
with
my
help
he
shook
his
head
no
i
could
climb
at
all
i
must
be
lifted
somehow
you
had
better
go
back
to
lungern
and
bring
men
to
help
you
leave
you
here
alone
never
harold
never
what
can
we
do
i
reflected
a
moment
me
your
pencil
i
said
he
pulled
it
out
his
arms
were
almost
unhurt
fortunately
i
scribbled
a
line
to
elsie
my
plaid
to
the
rope
and
let
it
down
then
i
waved
to
her
to
pull
up
again
i
was
half
surprised
to
find
she
obeyed
the
signal
for
she
crouched
there
and
watching
but
i
have
often
observed
that
women
are
almost
always
brave
in
the
great
emergencies
she
pinned
on
the
plaid
and
let
it
down
with
commendable
quickness
i
doubled
it
and
tied
firm
knots
in
the
four
corners
so
as
to
make
it
into
a
sort
of
basket
then
i
fastened
it
at
each
corner
with
a
piece
of
the
rope
crossed
in
the
middle
till
it
looked
like
one
of
the
cages
they
use
in
mills
for
letting
down
sacks
with
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
i
said
just
try
to
crawl
into
it
he
raised
himself
on
his
arms
and
crawled
in
with
difficulty
his
legs
dragged
after
him
i
could
see
he
was
in
great
pain
but
still
he
managed
it
i
planted
my
foot
in
the
first
noose
must
sit
still
i
said
breathless
am
going
back
to
haul
you
up
you
strong
enough
lois
elsie
to
help
me
yes
i
often
stroked
a
four
at
girton
can
trust
you
he
answered
it
thrilled
me
that
he
said
so
i
began
my
hazardous
journey
i
mounted
the
rope
by
the
nooses
one
two
three
four
counting
them
as
i
mounted
i
did
not
dare
to
look
up
or
down
as
i
did
so
lest
i
should
grow
giddy
and
fall
but
kept
my
eyes
fixed
firmly
always
on
the
one
noose
in
front
of
me
my
brain
swam
the
rope
swayed
and
creaked
twenty
thirty
forty
foot
after
foot
i
slipped
them
in
mechanically
taking
up
with
me
the
longer
coil
whose
ends
were
attached
to
the
cage
and
harold
my
hands
trembled
it
was
ghastly
swinging
there
between
earth
and
heaven
i
knew
there
were
of
them
at
last
after
some
weeks
as
it
seemed
i
reached
the
summit
tremulous
and
half
dead
i
prised
myself
over
the
edge
with
my
hands
and
knelt
once
more
on
the
hill
beside
elsie
she
was
white
but
attentive
next
brownie
her
voice
quivered
i
looked
about
me
i
was
too
faint
and
shaky
after
my
perilous
ascent
to
be
fit
for
work
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
what
could
i
use
as
a
pulley
not
a
tree
grew
near
but
the
stone
jammed
in
the
fissure
might
once
more
serve
my
purpose
i
tried
it
again
it
had
borne
my
weight
was
it
strong
enough
to
bear
the
precious
weight
of
harold
i
tugged
at
it
and
thought
so
i
passed
the
rope
round
it
like
a
pulley
and
then
tied
it
about
my
own
waist
i
had
a
happy
thought
i
could
use
myself
as
a
windlass
i
turned
on
my
feet
for
a
pivot
elsie
helped
me
to
pull
you
go
i
cried
cheerily
we
wound
slowly
for
fear
of
shaking
him
bit
by
bit
i
could
feel
the
cage
rise
gradually
from
the
ground
its
weight
taken
so
with
living
capstan
and
stone
axle
was
less
than
i
should
have
expected
but
the
pulley
helped
us
and
elsie
spurred
by
need
put
forth
more
reserve
of
nervous
strength
than
i
could
easily
have
believed
lay
in
that
tiny
body
i
twisted
myself
round
and
round
close
to
the
edge
so
as
to
look
over
from
time
to
time
but
not
at
all
quickly
for
fear
of
dizziness
the
rope
strained
and
gave
it
was
a
deadly
ten
minutes
of
suspense
and
anxiety
twice
or
thrice
as
i
looked
down
i
saw
a
spasm
of
pain
break
over
harold
face
but
when
i
paused
and
glanced
inquiringly
he
motioned
me
to
go
on
with
my
venturesome
task
there
was
no
turning
back
now
we
had
almost
got
him
up
when
the
rope
at
the
edge
began
to
creak
ominously
it
was
straining
at
the
point
where
it
grated
against
the
brink
of
the
precipice
my
heart
gave
a
leap
if
the
rope
broke
all
was
over
with
a
sudden
dart
forward
i
seized
it
with
my
hands
below
the
part
that
gave
then
one
fierce
little
run
back
and
i
brought
him
level
with
the
edge
he
clutched
at
elsie
hand
i
turned
thrice
round
to
wind
the
slack
about
my
body
the
taut
rope
cut
deep
into
my
flesh
but
nothing
mattered
now
except
to
save
him
the
cloak
elsie
i
cried
it
pull
him
gently
in
elsie
caught
it
and
pulled
him
in
with
wonderful
pluck
and
calmness
we
hauled
him
over
the
edge
he
lay
safe
on
the
bank
then
we
all
three
broke
down
and
cried
like
children
together
i
took
his
hand
in
mine
and
held
it
in
silence
when
we
found
words
again
i
drew
a
deep
breath
and
said
simply
did
you
manage
to
do
it
illustration
i
rolled
and
slid
down
tried
to
clamber
past
the
wall
that
barred
the
way
there
by
sheer
force
of
stride
you
know
my
legs
are
long
and
i
somehow
overbalanced
myself
but
i
did
exactly
fall
if
i
had
fallen
i
must
have
been
killed
i
rolled
and
slid
down
clutching
at
the
weeds
in
the
crannies
as
i
slipped
and
stumbling
over
the
projections
without
quite
losing
my
foothold
on
the
ledges
till
i
found
myself
brought
up
short
with
a
bump
at
the
end
of
it
you
think
no
bones
are
broken
ca
feel
sure
it
hurts
me
horribly
to
move
i
fancy
just
at
first
i
must
have
fainted
but
i
inclined
to
guess
i
only
sprained
and
bruised
and
sore
all
over
why
you
as
bad
as
me
i
believe
see
your
dear
hands
are
all
torn
and
bleeding
are
we
ever
to
get
him
back
again
brownie
elsie
put
in
she
was
paler
than
ever
now
and
prostrate
with
the
of
her
unwonted
effort
are
a
practical
woman
elsie
i
answered
with
him
here
a
minute
or
two
i
climb
up
the
hillside
and
halloo
for
ursula
and
the
men
from
lungern
i
climbed
and
hallooed
in
a
few
minutes
worn
out
as
i
was
i
had
reached
the
path
above
and
attracted
their
attention
they
hurried
down
to
where
harold
lay
and
using
my
cage
for
a
litter
slung
on
a
young
carried
him
back
between
them
across
their
shoulders
to
the
village
he
pleaded
hard
to
be
allowed
to
remain
at
the
and
elsie
joined
her
prayers
to
his
but
there
i
was
adamant
it
was
not
so
much
what
people
might
say
that
i
minded
but
a
deeper
difficulty
for
if
once
i
nursed
him
through
this
trouble
how
could
i
or
any
woman
in
my
place
any
longer
refuse
him
so
i
passed
him
ruthlessly
on
to
lungern
though
my
heart
ached
for
it
and
telegraphed
at
once
to
his
nearest
relative
lady
georgina
to
come
up
and
take
care
of
him
he
recovered
rapidly
though
sore
and
shaken
his
worst
hurts
it
turned
out
were
sprains
and
in
three
or
four
days
he
was
ready
to
go
on
again
i
called
to
see
him
before
he
left
i
dreaded
the
interview
for
one
own
heart
is
a
hard
enemy
to
fight
so
long
but
how
could
i
let
him
go
without
one
word
of
farewell
to
him
this
lois
he
said
taking
my
hand
in
his
and
i
was
weak
enough
for
a
moment
to
let
it
lie
there
say
no
to
me
oh
how
i
longed
to
fling
myself
upon
him
and
cry
out
harold
i
can
not
i
love
you
too
dearly
but
his
future
and
marmaduke
half
million
restrained
me
for
his
sake
and
for
my
own
i
held
myself
in
courageously
though
indeed
it
needed
some
courage
and
i
withdrew
my
hand
slowly
you
remember
i
said
asked
me
that
first
day
at
schlangenbad
it
was
an
epoch
to
me
now
that
first
day
i
was
mediÃ¦val
or
modern
and
i
answered
modern
i
hope
and
you
said
that
well
you
see
i
do
forget
the
least
things
you
say
to
me
well
because
i
am
modern
lips
trembled
and
belied
me
can
answer
you
no
i
can
even
now
refuse
you
the
girl
the
mediÃ¦val
girl
would
have
held
that
because
she
saved
your
life
if
i
save
your
life
which
is
a
matter
of
opinion
she
was
bound
to
marry
you
but
am
modern
and
i
see
things
differently
if
there
were
reasons
at
schlangenbad
which
made
it
impracticable
for
me
to
accept
you
though
my
heart
pleaded
hard
i
do
not
deny
it
those
reasons
can
not
have
disappeared
merely
because
you
have
chosen
to
fall
over
a
precipice
and
i
have
pulled
you
up
again
my
decision
was
founded
you
see
not
on
passing
accidents
of
situation
but
on
permanent
considerations
nothing
has
happened
in
the
last
three
days
to
affect
those
considerations
we
are
still
ourselves
you
rich
i
a
penniless
adventuress
i
could
not
accept
you
when
you
asked
me
at
schlangenbad
on
just
the
same
grounds
i
can
not
accept
you
now
i
do
not
see
how
the
unessential
fact
that
i
made
myself
into
a
winch
to
pull
you
up
the
cliff
and
that
i
am
still
smarting
for
it
he
looked
me
all
over
comically
severe
we
are
he
cried
in
a
bantering
tone
how
extremely
girtony
a
system
of
logic
ratiocinative
and
inductive
by
lois
cayley
what
a
pity
we
did
take
a
professor
chair
my
child
that
is
it
not
yourself
at
all
it
an
attempt
to
be
unnaturally
and
unfemininely
reasonable
logic
fled
i
broke
down
utterly
i
cried
rising
love
you
i
admit
i
love
you
but
i
will
never
marry
you
while
you
have
those
thousands
have
got
them
yet
the
chance
of
inheriting
them
he
smothered
my
hand
with
kisses
for
i
withdrew
my
face
you
admit
you
love
me
he
cried
quite
joyously
all
is
well
when
once
a
woman
admits
that
the
rest
is
but
a
matter
of
time
and
lois
i
can
wait
a
thousand
years
for
you
in
my
case
i
answered
through
my
tears
in
my
case
harold
i
am
a
modern
woman
and
what
i
say
i
mean
i
will
renew
my
promise
if
ever
you
are
poor
and
friendless
come
to
me
i
am
yours
till
then
do
harrow
me
by
asking
me
the
impossible
i
tore
myself
away
at
the
hall
door
lady
georgina
intercepted
me
she
glanced
at
my
red
eyes
you
have
taken
him
she
cried
seizing
my
hand
i
shook
my
head
firmly
i
could
hardly
speak
lady
georgina
i
answered
in
a
choking
voice
have
refused
him
again
i
will
not
stand
in
his
way
i
will
not
ruin
his
prospects
she
drew
back
and
let
her
chin
drop
of
all
the
cruel
obdurate
young
women
i
ever
saw
in
my
born
days
if
you
not
the
very
hardest
illustration
i
half
ran
from
the
house
i
hurried
home
to
the
there
i
dashed
into
my
own
room
locked
the
door
behind
me
flung
myself
wildly
on
my
bed
and
burying
my
face
in
my
hands
had
a
good
long
cruel
obdurate
cry
exactly
like
any
other
mediÃ¦val
woman
it
all
very
well
being
modern
but
my
experience
is
that
when
it
comes
to
a
man
one
loves
well
the
middle
ages
are
still
horribly
strong
within
us
vi
the
adventure
of
the
urbane
old
gentleman
when
elsie
holidays
i
beg
pardon
vacation
came
to
an
end
she
proposed
to
return
to
her
high
school
in
london
zeal
for
the
higher
mathematics
devoured
her
but
she
still
looked
so
frail
and
coughed
so
often
a
perfect
of
a
cough
in
spite
of
her
summer
of
exercise
that
i
positively
worried
her
into
consulting
a
doctor
not
one
of
the
order
the
report
he
gave
was
mildly
unfavourable
he
spoke
disrespectfully
of
the
apex
of
her
right
lung
it
was
not
exactly
tubercular
he
remarked
but
he
tuberculosis
excuse
the
long
words
the
phrase
was
his
not
mine
i
repeat
he
vetoed
her
exposing
herself
to
a
winter
in
london
in
her
present
unstable
condition
davos
well
no
davos
with
deliberative
thumb
and
finger
on
chin
he
judged
her
too
delicate
for
such
drastic
remedies
those
high
mountain
stations
suited
best
the
robust
invalid
who
had
dropped
by
accident
into
casual
phthisis
for
miss
petheridge
case
looking
wise
he
would
not
recommend
the
riviera
either
too
stimulating
too
exciting
what
this
young
lady
needed
most
was
rest
rest
in
some
agreeable
southern
town
some
city
of
the
soul
say
rome
or
florence
where
she
might
find
much
to
interest
her
and
might
forget
the
apex
of
her
right
lung
in
the
new
world
of
art
that
opened
around
her
well
i
said
promptly
settled
elsie
the
apex
and
you
shall
winter
in
florence
brownie
can
we
afford
it
it
i
echoed
gracious
my
dear
child
what
a
bourgeois
sentiment
your
medical
attendant
says
to
you
go
to
florence
and
to
florence
you
must
go
there
no
getting
out
of
it
why
even
the
swallows
fly
south
when
their
medical
attendant
tells
them
england
is
turning
a
trifle
too
cold
for
them
what
will
miss
latimer
say
she
depends
upon
me
to
come
back
at
the
beginning
of
term
she
have
to
undertake
the
higher
mathematics
she
will
get
somebody
dear
i
answered
calmly
trouble
your
sweet
little
head
about
that
an
eminent
statistician
has
calculated
that
five
hundred
and
thirty
duly
qualified
young
women
are
now
standing
in
a
solid
phalanx
in
the
streets
of
london
all
agog
to
teach
the
higher
mathematics
to
anyone
who
wants
them
at
a
moment
notice
let
miss
latimer
take
her
pick
of
the
five
hundred
and
thirty
i
wire
to
her
at
once
elsie
petheridge
unable
through
ill
health
to
resume
her
duties
ordered
to
florence
resigns
post
engage
substitute
the
way
to
do
it
elsie
clasped
her
small
white
hands
in
the
despair
of
the
woman
who
considers
herself
indispensable
as
if
we
were
any
of
us
indispensable
dearest
the
girls
they
be
disappointed
get
over
it
i
answered
grimly
are
worse
disappointments
in
store
for
them
in
life
which
is
a
fine
old
crusted
platitude
worthy
of
aunt
susan
anyhow
i
decided
look
here
elsie
i
stand
to
you
loco
i
have
already
remarked
i
think
that
she
was
three
years
my
senior
but
i
was
so
pleased
with
this
phrase
that
i
repeated
it
lovingly
stand
to
you
dear
loco
now
i
ca
let
you
endanger
your
precious
health
by
returning
to
town
and
miss
latimer
this
winter
let
us
be
categorical
i
go
to
florence
you
go
with
me
shall
we
live
upon
elsie
suggested
piteously
as
usual
i
answered
with
prompt
callousness
object
to
these
base
utilitarian
considerations
being
imported
into
the
discussion
of
a
serious
question
florence
is
the
city
of
art
as
a
woman
of
culture
it
behoves
you
to
revel
in
it
your
medical
attendant
sends
you
there
as
a
patient
and
an
invalid
you
can
revel
with
a
clear
conscience
money
well
money
is
a
secondary
matter
all
philosophies
and
all
religions
agree
that
money
is
mere
dross
filthy
lucre
rise
superior
to
it
we
have
a
fair
sum
in
hand
to
the
credit
of
the
firm
we
can
pick
up
some
more
i
suppose
in
florence
i
reflected
i
said
are
deficient
in
faith
which
is
one
of
the
leading
christian
graces
my
mission
in
life
is
to
correct
that
want
in
your
spiritual
nature
now
observe
how
beautifully
all
these
events
work
in
together
the
winter
comes
when
no
man
can
bicycle
especially
in
switzerland
therefore
what
is
the
use
of
my
stopping
on
here
after
october
again
in
pursuance
of
my
general
plan
of
going
round
the
world
i
must
get
forward
to
italy
your
medical
attendant
considerately
orders
you
at
the
same
time
to
florence
in
florence
we
shall
still
have
chances
of
selling
manitous
though
possibly
i
admit
in
diminished
numbers
i
confess
at
once
that
people
come
to
switzerland
to
tour
and
are
therefore
liable
to
need
our
machines
while
they
go
to
florence
to
look
at
pictures
and
a
bicycle
would
doubtless
prove
inconvenient
in
the
uffizi
or
the
pitti
still
we
sell
a
few
but
i
descry
another
opening
you
write
shorthand
do
you
little
dear
only
ninety
words
a
minute
not
business
advertise
yourself
cyrus
hitchcock
say
boldly
i
write
shorthand
leave
the
world
to
ask
how
fast
it
will
ask
it
quick
enough
without
your
suggesting
it
well
my
idea
is
this
florence
is
a
town
teeming
with
english
tourists
of
the
cultivated
classes
men
of
letters
painters
antiquaries
i
suppose
even
may
be
classed
as
cultivated
such
people
are
sure
to
need
literary
aid
we
exist
to
supply
it
we
will
set
up
the
florentine
school
of
stenography
and
typewriting
we
buy
a
couple
of
typewriters
can
we
pay
for
them
brownie
illustration
there
enterprise
for
you
i
gazed
at
her
in
despair
i
cried
clapping
my
hand
to
my
head
are
not
practical
did
i
ever
suggest
we
should
pay
for
them
i
said
merely
buy
them
base
is
the
slave
that
pays
shakespeare
and
we
all
know
shakespeare
is
the
mirror
of
nature
argal
it
would
be
unnatural
to
pay
for
a
typewriter
we
will
hire
a
room
in
florence
on
tick
of
course
and
begin
operations
clients
will
flock
in
and
we
tide
over
the
winter
enterprise
for
you
and
i
struck
an
attitude
elsie
face
looked
her
doubts
i
walked
across
to
evelegh
desk
and
began
writing
a
letter
it
occurred
to
me
that
hitchcock
who
was
a
man
of
business
might
be
able
to
help
a
woman
of
business
in
this
delicate
matter
i
put
the
point
to
him
fairly
and
squarely
without
circumlocution
we
were
going
to
start
an
english
typewriting
office
in
florence
what
was
the
ordinary
way
for
people
to
become
possessed
of
a
typewriting
machine
without
the
odious
and
mercenary
preliminary
of
paying
for
it
the
answer
came
back
with
commendable
promptitude
dear
miss
your
spirit
of
enterprise
is
really
remarkable
i
have
forwarded
your
letter
to
my
friends
of
the
spread
eagle
typewriting
and
phonograph
company
limited
of
new
york
city
informing
them
of
your
desire
to
open
an
agency
for
the
sale
of
their
machines
in
florence
italy
and
giving
them
my
estimate
of
your
business
capacities
i
have
advised
their
london
house
to
present
you
with
two
complimentary
machines
for
your
own
use
and
your
partner
and
also
to
supply
a
number
of
others
for
disposal
in
the
city
of
florence
if
you
would
further
like
to
undertake
an
agency
for
the
development
of
the
trade
in
salt
codfish
large
quantities
of
which
are
of
course
consumed
in
catholic
europe
i
could
put
you
into
communication
with
my
respected
friends
abel
woodward
and
exporters
of
preserved
provisions
st
john
newfoundland
but
perhaps
in
this
suggestion
i
am
not
sufficiently
respectfully
cyrus
hitchcock
the
moment
had
arrived
for
elsie
to
be
firm
have
no
prejudice
against
trade
brownie
she
observed
emphatically
i
do
draw
the
line
at
salt
fish
do
i
dear
i
answered
she
sighed
her
relief
i
really
believe
she
half
expected
to
find
me
trotting
about
florence
with
miscellaneous
samples
of
abel
woodward
esteemed
productions
protruding
from
my
pocket
so
to
florence
we
went
my
first
idea
was
to
travel
by
the
brenner
route
through
the
tyrol
but
a
queer
little
episode
which
met
us
at
the
outset
on
the
austrian
frontier
put
a
check
to
this
plan
we
cycled
to
the
border
sending
our
trunks
on
by
rail
when
we
went
to
claim
them
at
the
austrian
we
were
told
they
were
detained
political
reasons
reasons
i
exclaimed
nonplussed
so
frÃ¤ulein
your
boxes
contain
revolutionary
literature
mistake
i
cried
warmly
i
am
but
a
socialist
at
all
look
here
and
he
drew
a
small
book
out
of
portmanteau
what
elsie
a
conspirator
elsie
in
league
with
nihilists
so
mild
and
so
meek
i
could
never
have
believed
it
i
took
the
book
in
my
hands
and
read
the
title
of
the
heavenly
bodies
this
is
astronomy
i
burst
out
you
see
circling
the
revolution
of
the
planets
matters
not
frÃ¤ulein
our
instructions
are
strict
we
have
orders
to
intercept
revolutionary
literature
without
distinction
elsie
i
said
firmly
is
ridiculous
let
us
give
them
a
clear
berth
these
blockheads
so
we
registered
our
luggage
right
back
to
lucerne
and
cycled
over
the
gotthard
illustration
painting
the
when
at
last
by
leisurely
stages
we
arrived
at
florence
i
felt
there
was
no
use
in
doing
things
by
halves
if
you
are
going
to
start
the
florentine
school
of
stenography
and
typewriting
you
may
as
well
start
it
on
a
proper
basis
so
i
took
sunny
rooms
at
a
nice
hotel
for
myself
and
elsie
and
hired
a
ground
floor
in
a
convenient
house
close
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
marble
campanile
considerations
of
space
compel
me
to
curtail
the
usual
gush
about
arnolfo
and
giotto
this
was
our
office
when
i
had
got
a
tuscan
painter
to
plant
our
flag
in
the
shape
of
a
i
sailed
forth
into
the
street
and
inspected
it
from
outside
with
a
swelling
heart
it
is
true
the
tuscan
unaccountable
predilection
for
the
rare
spellings
without
an
and
with
an
somewhat
damped
my
exuberant
pride
for
the
moment
but
i
made
him
take
the
board
back
and
correct
his
italianate
english
as
soon
as
all
was
fitted
up
with
desk
and
tables
we
reposed
upon
our
laurels
and
waited
only
for
customers
in
shoals
to
pour
in
upon
us
called
them
elsie
maintained
that
we
ought
rather
to
say
being
by
temperament
averse
to
sectarianism
i
did
not
dispute
the
point
with
her
we
reposed
on
our
laurels
in
vain
neither
customers
nor
clients
seemed
in
any
particular
hurry
to
disturb
our
leisure
i
confess
i
took
this
ill
it
was
a
rude
awakening
i
had
begun
to
regard
myself
as
the
special
favourite
of
a
fairy
godmother
it
surprised
me
to
find
that
any
undertaking
of
mine
did
not
succeed
immediately
however
reflecting
that
my
fairy
godmother
name
was
really
enterprise
i
recalled
cyrus
hitchcock
advice
and
advertised
one
good
thing
about
florence
elsie
i
said
just
to
keep
up
her
courage
the
customers
come
they
be
interesting
people
and
it
will
be
interesting
work
artistic
work
do
you
know
fra
angelico
and
della
robbia
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
or
else
fresh
light
on
dante
and
petrarch
they
come
no
doubt
elsie
answered
dubiously
do
you
know
brownie
it
strikes
me
there
is
quite
that
literary
stir
and
ferment
one
might
expect
in
florence
dante
and
petrarch
appear
to
be
dead
the
distinguished
authors
fail
to
stream
in
upon
us
as
one
imagined
with
manuscripts
to
copy
i
affected
an
air
of
confidence
for
i
had
sunk
capital
in
the
concern
that
sunk
capital
we
a
new
firm
i
assented
carelessly
enterprise
is
yet
young
when
cultivated
florence
learns
we
here
cultivated
florence
will
invade
us
in
its
thousands
but
we
sat
in
our
office
and
bit
our
thumbs
all
day
the
thousands
stopped
at
home
we
had
ample
opportunities
for
making
studies
of
the
decorative
detail
on
the
campanile
till
we
knew
every
square
inch
of
it
better
than
ruskin
elsie
notebook
contains
i
believe
eleven
hundred
separate
sketches
of
the
campanile
from
the
right
end
the
left
end
and
the
middle
of
our
window
with
eight
hundred
and
five
distinct
distortions
of
the
individual
statues
that
adorn
its
niches
on
the
side
turned
towards
us
at
last
after
we
had
sat
and
bitten
our
thumbs
and
sketched
the
four
greater
prophets
for
a
fortnight
on
end
an
immense
excitement
occurred
an
old
gentleman
was
distinctly
seen
to
approach
and
to
look
up
at
the
which
decorated
our
office
i
instantly
slipped
in
a
sheet
of
foolscap
and
began
to
with
alarming
speed
click
click
click
while
elsie
rising
to
the
occasion
set
to
work
to
transcribe
imaginary
shorthand
as
if
her
life
depended
upon
it
the
old
gentleman
after
a
moment
hesitation
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
somewhat
nervously
i
affected
to
take
no
notice
of
him
so
breathless
was
the
haste
with
which
our
immense
business
connection
compelled
me
to
finger
the
keyboard
but
looking
up
at
him
under
my
eyelashes
i
could
just
make
out
he
was
a
peculiarly
bland
and
urbane
old
person
dressed
with
the
greatest
care
and
some
attention
to
fashion
his
face
was
smooth
it
tended
towards
portliness
he
made
up
his
mind
and
entered
the
office
i
continued
to
click
till
i
had
reached
the
close
of
a
sentence
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
then
i
looked
up
sharply
i
do
anything
for
you
i
inquired
in
the
smartest
tone
of
business
i
observe
that
politeness
is
not
professional
illustration
the
urbane
old
gentleman
the
urbane
old
gentleman
came
forward
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
landed
from
the
eighteenth
century
his
figure
was
that
of
edward
gibbon
madam
he
said
in
a
markedly
deferential
tone
fussing
about
with
the
rim
of
his
hat
as
he
spoke
and
adjusting
his
was
recommended
to
your
ur
your
establishment
for
shorthand
and
typewriting
i
have
some
work
which
i
wish
done
if
it
falls
within
your
province
but
i
am
particular
i
require
a
quick
worker
excuse
my
asking
it
but
how
many
words
can
you
do
a
minute
i
asked
sharply
for
i
wished
to
imitate
official
habits
the
urbane
old
gentleman
bowed
shorthand
certainly
i
waved
my
hand
with
careless
grace
towards
elsie
as
if
these
things
happened
to
us
daily
petheridge
undertakes
the
shorthand
department
i
said
with
decision
am
the
typewriting
from
dictation
miss
petheridge
forward
elsie
rose
to
it
like
an
angel
hundred
she
answered
confronting
him
the
old
gentleman
bowed
again
your
terms
he
inquired
in
a
voice
i
may
venture
to
ask
them
we
handed
him
our
printed
tariff
he
seemed
satisfied
you
spare
me
an
hour
this
morning
he
asked
still
fingering
his
hat
nervously
with
his
puffy
hand
perhaps
you
are
engaged
i
fear
i
intrude
upon
you
at
all
i
answered
consulting
an
imaginary
engagement
list
work
can
wait
let
me
see
elsie
i
think
you
have
nothing
to
do
before
one
that
can
not
be
put
off
quite
so
very
well
then
yes
we
are
both
at
your
service
the
urbane
old
gentleman
looked
about
him
for
a
seat
i
pushed
him
our
one
easy
chair
he
withdrew
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
and
sat
down
in
it
with
an
apologetic
glance
i
could
gather
from
his
dress
and
his
diamond
pin
that
he
was
wealthy
indeed
i
half
guessed
who
he
was
already
there
was
a
fussiness
about
his
manner
which
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
me
he
sat
down
by
slow
degrees
edging
himself
about
till
he
was
thoroughly
comfortable
i
could
see
he
was
of
the
kind
that
will
have
comfort
he
took
out
his
notes
and
a
packet
of
letters
which
he
sorted
slowly
then
he
looked
hard
at
me
and
at
elsie
he
seemed
to
be
making
his
choice
between
us
after
a
time
he
spoke
he
said
in
a
most
leisurely
voice
will
not
trouble
your
friend
to
write
shorthand
for
me
after
all
or
should
i
say
your
assistant
excuse
my
change
of
plan
i
will
content
myself
with
dictation
you
can
follow
on
the
machine
fast
as
you
choose
to
dictate
to
me
he
glanced
at
his
notes
and
began
a
letter
it
was
a
curious
communication
it
seemed
to
be
all
about
buying
bertha
and
selling
clara
a
proceeding
which
almost
suggested
i
gathered
he
was
giving
instructions
to
his
agent
could
he
have
business
relations
with
cuba
i
wondered
but
there
were
also
hints
of
mysterious
middies
brave
british
tars
to
the
rescue
possibly
perhaps
my
bewilderment
showed
itself
upon
my
face
for
at
last
he
looked
queerly
at
me
do
quite
like
this
i
afraid
he
said
breaking
off
short
i
was
the
soul
of
business
at
all
i
answered
am
an
automaton
nothing
more
it
is
a
typewriter
function
to
transcribe
the
words
a
client
dictates
as
if
they
were
absolutely
meaningless
to
her
right
he
answered
approvingly
right
i
see
you
understand
a
very
proper
spirit
then
the
woman
within
me
got
the
better
of
the
typewriter
i
confess
i
continued
feel
it
is
a
little
unkind
to
sell
clara
at
once
for
whatever
she
will
fetch
it
seems
to
me
well
unchivalrous
he
smiled
but
held
his
peace
the
middies
i
went
on
will
perhaps
take
care
that
these
poor
girls
are
not
he
leaned
back
clasped
his
hands
and
regarded
me
fixedly
he
said
after
a
pause
brighton
a
to
be
strictly
correct
london
brighton
and
south
coast
first
preference
debentures
clara
is
glasgow
and
deferred
stock
middies
are
midland
ordinary
but
i
respect
your
feeling
you
are
a
young
lady
of
principle
and
he
fidgeted
more
than
ever
illustration
he
went
on
dictating
for
just
an
hour
he
went
on
dictating
for
just
an
hour
his
bewildered
me
it
was
all
about
india
bills
and
telegraphic
transfers
and
selling
cotton
short
and
holding
tight
to
egyptian
unified
markets
it
seemed
were
glutted
hungarians
were
only
to
be
dealt
in
if
they
hardened
hardened
sinners
i
know
but
what
are
hardened
hungarians
and
fears
were
not
unnaturally
expressed
that
turks
might
be
consols
it
appeared
were
certain
to
give
way
for
political
reasons
but
the
downward
tendency
of
australians
i
was
relieved
to
learn
for
the
honour
of
so
great
a
group
of
colonies
could
only
be
temporary
greeks
were
growing
decidedly
worse
though
i
had
always
understood
greeks
were
bad
enough
already
and
argentine
central
were
likely
to
be
weak
but
provincials
must
soon
become
commendably
firm
and
if
uruguays
went
flat
something
good
ought
to
be
made
out
of
them
scotch
rails
might
shortly
be
quiet
i
always
understood
they
were
based
upon
sleepers
but
if
stiffened
advantage
should
certainly
be
taken
of
their
stiffening
he
would
telegraph
particulars
on
monday
morning
and
so
on
till
my
brain
reeled
oh
artistic
florence
was
the
filippo
lippi
the
michael
angelo
i
dreamed
of
at
the
end
of
the
hour
the
urbane
old
gentleman
rose
urbanely
he
drew
on
his
gloves
again
with
the
greatest
deliberation
and
hunted
for
his
stick
as
if
his
life
depended
upon
it
me
see
i
had
a
pencil
oh
thanks
yes
that
is
it
this
cover
protects
the
point
my
hat
ah
certainly
and
my
notes
much
obliged
notes
get
mislaid
people
are
so
careless
then
i
will
come
again
the
same
hour
if
you
will
kindly
keep
yourself
disengaged
though
excuse
me
you
had
better
make
an
entry
of
it
at
once
upon
your
agenda
shall
remember
it
i
answered
smiling
will
you
but
you
have
my
name
know
it
i
answered
least
i
think
so
you
are
marmaduke
ashurst
lady
georgina
fawley
sent
you
here
he
laid
down
his
hat
and
gloves
again
so
as
to
regard
me
more
undistracted
are
a
most
remarkable
young
lady
he
said
in
a
very
slow
voice
impressed
upon
georgina
that
she
must
not
mention
to
you
that
i
was
coming
how
on
earth
did
you
recognise
me
most
likely
he
stared
at
me
with
a
sort
of
suspicion
do
tell
me
you
think
me
like
my
sister
he
went
on
though
of
course
every
man
feels
ur
a
natural
respect
and
affection
for
the
members
his
family
bows
if
i
may
so
say
to
the
inscrutable
decrees
of
providence
which
has
mysteriously
burdened
him
with
them
still
there
points
about
lady
georgina
which
i
can
not
conscientiously
assert
i
approve
of
i
remembered
a
fool
and
held
my
tongue
judiciously
do
not
resemble
her
i
hope
he
persisted
with
a
look
which
i
could
almost
describe
as
wistful
family
likeness
perhaps
i
put
in
likenesses
exist
you
know
often
with
complete
divergence
of
tastes
and
character
he
looked
relieved
is
true
oh
how
true
but
the
likeness
in
my
case
i
must
admit
escapes
me
i
temporised
see
these
things
most
i
said
airing
the
stock
platitudes
may
be
superficial
and
of
course
one
knows
that
profound
differences
of
intellect
and
moral
feeling
often
occur
within
the
limits
of
a
single
family
are
quite
right
he
said
with
decision
principles
are
not
mine
excuse
my
remarking
it
but
you
seem
to
be
a
young
lady
of
unusual
penetration
i
saw
he
took
my
remark
as
a
compliment
what
i
really
meant
to
say
was
that
a
commonplace
man
might
easily
be
brother
to
so
clever
a
woman
as
lady
georgina
illustration
he
bowed
to
us
each
separately
he
gathered
up
his
hat
his
stick
his
gloves
his
notes
and
his
typewritten
letters
one
by
one
and
backed
out
politely
he
was
a
punctilious
millionaire
he
had
risen
by
urbanity
to
his
brother
directors
like
a
model
he
bowed
to
us
each
separately
as
if
we
had
been
duchesses
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
elsie
turned
to
me
how
on
earth
did
you
guess
it
they
so
awfully
different
at
all
i
answered
few
surface
unlikenesses
only
just
mask
an
underlying
identity
their
features
are
the
same
but
his
are
plump
hers
shrunken
lady
georgina
expression
is
sharp
and
worldly
ashurst
is
smooth
and
bland
and
financial
and
then
their
manner
both
are
fussy
but
lady
georgina
is
honest
open
fussiness
ashurst
is
concealed
under
an
artificial
mask
of
obsequious
politeness
one
cantankerous
the
other
only
pernicketty
it
one
tune
after
all
in
two
different
keys
from
that
day
forth
the
urbane
old
gentleman
was
a
daily
visitor
he
took
an
hour
at
a
time
at
first
but
after
a
few
days
the
hour
lengthened
out
apologetically
to
an
entire
morning
he
to
ask
my
christian
name
the
second
day
and
remembered
my
father
man
of
excellent
principles
but
he
did
care
for
elsie
to
work
for
him
fortunately
for
her
other
work
dropped
in
once
we
had
found
a
client
or
else
poor
girl
she
would
have
felt
sadly
slighted
i
was
glad
she
had
something
to
do
the
sense
of
dependence
weighed
heavily
upon
her
the
urbane
old
gentleman
did
not
confine
himself
entirely
after
the
first
few
days
to
stock
exchange
literature
he
was
engaged
on
a
work
he
spoke
of
it
always
with
bated
breath
and
a
capital
letter
was
implied
in
his
intonation
the
work
was
one
on
the
interpretation
of
prophecy
unlike
lady
georgina
who
was
tart
and
crisp
marmaduke
ashurst
was
devout
and
decorous
where
she
said
of
fools
he
talked
with
unction
of
mental
deficiencies
of
our
poorer
brethren
but
his
religious
opinions
and
his
stockbroking
had
got
strangely
mixed
up
at
the
wash
somehow
he
was
convinced
that
the
british
nation
represented
the
lost
ten
tribes
of
israel
and
in
particular
ephraim
a
matter
on
which
as
a
mere
i
would
not
presume
either
to
agree
with
him
or
to
differ
from
him
being
so
miss
cayley
we
can
easily
understand
that
the
existing
commercial
prosperity
of
england
depends
upon
the
promises
made
to
abraham
i
assented
without
committing
myself
would
seem
to
follow
ashurst
encouraged
by
so
much
assent
went
on
to
unfold
his
system
of
interpretation
which
was
of
a
strictly
commercial
or
character
it
ran
like
a
prospectus
have
inherited
the
gold
of
australia
and
the
diamonds
of
the
cape
he
said
growing
didactic
and
lifting
one
fat
forefinger
are
now
inheriting
klondike
and
the
rand
for
it
is
morally
certain
that
we
shall
annex
the
transvaal
again
the
chief
things
of
the
ancient
mountains
and
the
precious
things
of
the
everlasting
hills
what
does
that
mean
the
ancient
mountains
are
clearly
the
rockies
can
the
everlasting
hills
be
anything
but
the
himalayas
for
they
shall
suck
of
the
abundance
of
the
seas
that
refers
of
course
to
our
commerce
due
mainly
to
imports
and
of
the
treasures
hid
in
the
sand
which
sand
undoubtedly
i
say
the
desert
of
mount
sinai
what
then
is
our
obvious
destiny
a
lady
of
your
intelligence
must
gather
at
once
that
it
is
he
paused
and
gazed
at
me
drive
the
sultan
out
of
syria
i
suggested
tentatively
to
annex
palestine
to
our
practical
province
of
egypt
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
folded
his
fat
hands
in
undisguised
satisfaction
you
are
a
thinker
of
exceptional
penetration
he
broke
out
you
know
miss
cayley
i
have
tried
to
make
that
point
clear
to
the
war
office
and
the
prime
minister
and
many
leading
financiers
in
the
city
of
london
and
i
get
them
to
see
it
they
have
no
heads
those
people
but
catch
at
it
at
a
glance
why
i
endeavoured
to
interest
rothschild
and
induce
him
to
join
me
in
my
palestine
development
syndicate
and
will
you
believe
it
the
man
refused
point
blank
though
if
he
had
only
looked
at
nahum
iii
financiers
i
said
smiling
not
consider
these
questions
from
a
historical
and
prophetic
point
of
view
they
see
nothing
above
percentages
it
he
replied
lighting
up
have
no
higher
feelings
though
mind
you
there
will
be
dividends
too
mark
my
words
there
will
be
dividends
this
syndicate
besides
fulfilling
the
prophecies
will
pay
forty
per
cent
on
every
penny
embarked
in
it
forty
per
cent
for
ephraim
i
murmured
half
below
my
breath
judah
is
said
to
batten
upon
sixty
he
caught
at
it
eagerly
without
perceiving
my
gentle
sarcasm
that
case
we
might
even
expect
seventy
he
put
in
with
a
gasp
of
anticipation
i
approached
rothschild
first
with
my
scheme
on
purpose
so
that
israel
and
judah
might
once
more
unite
in
sharing
the
promises
combined
generosity
and
commercial
instinct
does
you
credit
i
answered
is
rare
to
find
so
much
love
for
an
abstract
study
side
by
side
with
such
conspicuous
financial
ability
his
guilelessness
was
beyond
words
he
swallowed
it
like
an
infant
i
think
he
answered
am
glad
to
observe
that
you
understand
my
character
mere
city
men
do
they
have
no
soul
above
shekels
though
as
i
show
them
there
are
shekels
in
it
too
dividends
dividends
but
are
a
lady
of
understanding
and
comprehension
you
have
been
to
girton
have
you
perhaps
you
read
greek
then
to
get
on
with
you
look
things
up
in
herodotus
the
original
dear
yes
he
regarded
me
once
more
with
the
same
astonished
glance
his
own
classics
i
soon
learnt
were
limited
to
the
amount
which
a
public
school
succeeds
in
dinning
during
the
intervals
of
cricket
and
football
into
an
english
gentleman
then
he
informed
me
that
he
wished
me
to
hunt
up
certain
facts
in
herodotus
and
elsewhere
confirmatory
of
his
view
that
the
english
were
the
descendants
of
the
ten
tribes
i
promised
to
do
so
swallowing
even
that
comprehensive
elsewhere
it
was
none
of
my
business
to
believe
or
disbelieve
i
was
paid
to
get
up
a
case
and
i
got
one
up
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
imagine
it
was
at
least
as
good
as
most
other
cases
in
similar
matters
at
any
rate
it
pleased
the
old
gentleman
vastly
by
dint
of
listening
i
began
to
like
him
but
elsie
could
bear
him
she
hated
the
fat
crease
at
the
back
of
his
neck
she
told
me
after
a
week
or
two
devoted
to
the
interpretation
of
prophecy
on
a
strictly
commercial
basis
of
founders
shares
with
interludes
of
mining
engineers
reports
upon
the
rubies
of
mount
sinai
and
the
supposed
auriferous
quartzites
of
palestine
the
urbane
old
gentleman
trotted
down
to
the
office
one
day
carrying
a
packet
of
notes
of
most
voluminous
magnitude
can
we
work
in
a
room
alone
this
morning
miss
cayley
he
asked
with
mystery
in
his
voice
he
was
always
mysterious
i
want
to
intrust
you
with
a
piece
of
work
of
an
exceptionally
private
and
confidential
character
it
concerns
property
in
point
of
fact
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
i
want
you
to
draw
up
my
will
for
me
certainly
i
said
opening
the
door
into
the
back
office
but
i
trembled
in
my
shoes
could
this
mean
that
he
was
going
to
draw
up
a
will
disinheriting
harold
tillington
and
suppose
he
did
what
then
my
heart
was
in
a
tumult
if
harold
were
rich
well
and
good
i
could
never
marry
him
but
if
harold
were
poor
i
must
keep
my
promise
could
i
wish
him
to
be
rich
could
i
wish
him
to
be
poor
my
heart
stood
divided
two
ways
within
me
the
urbane
old
gentleman
began
with
immense
deliberation
as
befits
a
man
of
principle
when
property
is
at
stake
will
kindly
take
down
notes
from
my
dictation
he
said
fussing
with
his
papers
afterwards
i
will
ask
you
to
be
so
good
as
to
copy
it
all
out
fair
on
your
typewriter
for
signature
a
typewritten
form
legal
i
ventured
to
inquire
most
perspicacious
young
lady
he
interjected
well
pleased
have
investigated
that
point
and
find
it
perfectly
regular
only
if
i
may
venture
to
say
so
there
should
be
no
erasures
shall
be
none
i
answered
the
urbane
old
gentleman
leant
back
in
his
easy
chair
and
began
dictating
from
his
notes
with
tantalising
deliberateness
this
was
the
last
will
and
testament
of
him
marmaduke
courtney
ashurst
its
verbiage
wearied
me
i
was
eager
for
him
to
come
to
the
point
about
harold
instead
of
that
he
did
what
it
seems
is
usual
in
such
cases
set
out
with
a
number
of
unimportant
legacies
to
old
family
servants
and
other
among
poorer
brethren
i
fumed
and
fretted
inwardly
next
came
a
series
of
quaint
bequests
of
a
quite
novel
character
give
and
bequeath
to
james
walsh
and
sons
of
high
holborn
london
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
in
consideration
of
the
benefit
they
have
conferred
upon
humanity
by
the
invention
of
a
or
silver
by
means
of
which
it
is
possible
to
dust
sugar
upon
a
tart
or
pudding
without
letting
the
whole
or
the
greater
part
of
the
material
run
through
the
apertures
uselessly
in
transit
you
must
have
observed
miss
cayley
with
your
usual
perspicacity
that
most
allow
the
sugar
to
fall
through
them
on
to
the
table
prematurely
have
noticed
it
i
answered
trembling
with
anxiety
walsh
and
sons
acting
on
a
hint
from
me
have
succeeded
in
inventing
a
form
of
spoon
which
does
not
possess
that
regrettable
drawback
run
through
the
apertures
uselessly
in
transit
i
think
i
said
last
yes
thank
you
very
good
we
will
now
continue
and
i
give
and
bequeath
the
like
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
did
i
say
free
of
legacy
duty
no
then
please
add
it
to
james
walsh
clause
five
hundred
pounds
free
of
legacy
duty
to
thomas
webster
jones
of
wheeler
street
soho
for
his
admirable
invention
of
a
pair
of
braces
which
will
not
slip
down
on
the
wearer
shoulders
after
half
an
hour
use
most
braces
you
must
have
observed
miss
cayley
acquaintance
with
braces
is
limited
not
to
say
abstract
i
interposed
smiling
he
gazed
at
me
and
twirled
his
fat
thumbs
course
he
murmured
course
but
most
braces
you
may
not
be
aware
slip
down
unpleasantly
on
the
and
so
lead
to
an
awkward
habit
of
hitching
them
up
by
the
of
the
waistcoat
at
frequent
intervals
such
a
habit
must
be
felt
to
be
ungraceful
thomas
webster
jones
to
whom
i
pointed
out
this
error
of
manufacture
has
invented
a
brace
the
two
halves
of
which
diverge
at
a
higher
angle
than
usual
and
fasten
further
towards
the
centre
of
the
body
in
front
pardon
these
details
so
as
to
obviate
that
difficulty
he
has
given
me
satisfaction
and
he
deserves
to
be
rewarded
i
heard
through
it
all
the
voice
of
lady
georgina
observing
tartly
the
idiots
ca
make
braces
to
fit
one
at
first
passes
comprehension
but
there
my
dear
the
people
who
manufacture
them
are
a
set
of
born
fools
and
what
can
you
expect
from
an
imbecile
ashurst
was
lady
georgina
veneered
with
a
thin
layer
of
ingratiating
urbanity
lady
georgina
was
clever
and
therefore
acrimonious
ashurst
was
astute
and
therefore
obsequious
he
went
on
with
legacies
to
the
inventor
of
a
which
did
not
let
the
last
drop
dribble
down
so
as
to
spot
the
of
a
the
handle
of
which
did
not
come
undone
and
of
a
pair
of
which
you
could
put
off
and
on
without
injury
to
the
temper
real
benefactor
miss
cayley
a
real
benefactor
to
the
classes
for
he
has
sensibly
diminished
the
average
annual
output
of
profane
swearing
when
he
left
five
hundred
pounds
to
his
faithful
servant
frederic
higginson
courier
i
was
tempted
to
interpose
but
i
refrained
in
time
and
i
was
glad
of
it
afterwards
at
last
after
many
divagations
my
urbane
old
gentleman
arrived
at
the
central
point
i
give
and
bequeath
to
my
nephew
harold
ashurst
tillington
younger
of
gledcliffe
dumfriesshire
attachÃ©
to
her
majesty
embassy
at
rome
illustration
i
waited
breathless
i
waited
breathless
he
was
annoyingly
dilatory
house
and
estate
of
ashurst
court
in
the
county
of
gloucester
and
my
town
house
at
park
lane
north
in
london
together
with
the
residue
of
all
my
estate
real
or
personal
and
so
forth
i
breathed
again
at
least
i
had
not
been
called
upon
to
disinherit
harold
always
he
went
on
in
the
same
voice
i
wondered
what
was
coming
always
that
the
said
harold
ashurst
tillington
does
not
marry
leave
a
blank
there
miss
cayley
i
will
find
out
the
name
of
the
young
person
i
desire
to
exclude
and
fill
it
in
afterward
i
recollect
it
at
this
moment
but
higginson
no
doubt
will
be
able
to
supply
the
deficiency
in
fact
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
it
though
higginson
has
told
me
all
about
the
woman
i
inquired
he
here
dear
yes
you
heard
of
him
i
suppose
from
georgina
georgina
is
prejudiced
he
has
come
back
to
me
i
am
glad
to
say
an
excellent
servant
higginson
though
a
trifle
too
omniscient
all
men
are
equal
in
the
eyes
of
their
maker
of
course
but
we
must
have
due
subordination
a
courier
ought
not
to
be
better
informed
than
his
master
or
ought
at
least
to
conceal
the
fact
dexterously
well
higginson
knows
this
young
person
name
my
sister
wrote
to
me
about
her
disgraceful
conduct
when
she
first
went
to
schlangenbad
an
adventuress
it
seems
an
adventuress
quite
a
shocking
creature
foisted
herself
upon
lady
georgina
in
kensington
gardens
unintroduced
if
you
can
believe
such
a
thing
with
the
most
astonishing
effrontery
and
georgina
who
will
forgive
anything
on
earth
for
the
sake
of
what
she
calls
originality
another
name
for
impudence
as
i
am
sure
you
must
know
took
the
young
woman
with
her
as
her
maid
to
germany
there
this
minx
tried
to
set
her
cap
at
my
nephew
harold
who
can
be
caught
at
once
by
a
pretty
face
and
harold
was
bowled
over
almost
got
engaged
to
her
georgina
took
a
fancy
to
the
girl
later
having
a
taste
for
dubious
people
i
can
not
say
i
approve
of
georgina
friends
and
wrote
again
to
say
her
first
suspicions
were
unfounded
the
young
woman
was
in
reality
a
paragon
of
virtue
but
know
better
than
that
georgina
has
no
judgment
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
confess
it
but
cleverness
i
fear
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
my
excellent
sister
cares
for
the
hussy
it
seems
was
certainly
clever
higginson
has
told
me
about
her
he
says
her
bare
appearance
would
suffice
to
condemn
her
a
bold
fast
shameless
creature
but
you
will
forgive
me
i
am
sure
my
dear
young
lady
i
ought
not
to
discuss
such
painted
jezebels
before
you
we
will
leave
this
person
name
blank
i
will
not
sully
your
pen
i
mean
your
typewriter
by
asking
you
to
transcribe
it
i
made
up
my
mind
at
once
ashurst
i
said
looking
up
from
my
keyboard
can
give
you
this
girl
name
and
then
you
can
insert
the
proviso
immediately
can
my
dear
young
lady
what
a
wonderful
person
you
are
you
seem
to
know
everybody
and
everything
but
perhaps
she
was
at
schlangenbad
with
lady
georgina
and
you
were
there
also
was
i
answered
deliberately
name
you
want
is
lois
cayley
he
let
his
notes
drop
in
his
astonishment
i
went
on
with
my
typewriting
unmoved
always
that
the
said
harold
ashurst
tillington
does
not
marry
lois
cayley
in
which
case
i
will
and
desire
that
the
said
estate
shall
pass
to
whom
shall
i
put
in
mr
ashurst
he
leant
forward
with
his
fat
hands
on
his
ample
knees
was
really
he
inquired
i
nodded
is
no
use
in
denying
the
truth
tillington
did
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
and
i
refused
him
my
dear
miss
cayley
difference
in
station
i
said
difference
still
greater
in
this
world
goods
yes
i
know
i
admit
all
that
so
i
declined
his
offer
i
did
not
wish
to
ruin
his
prospects
the
urbane
old
gentleman
eyed
me
with
a
sudden
tenderness
in
his
glance
men
are
lucky
he
said
slowly
after
a
short
pause
and
higginson
is
an
idiot
i
say
it
deliberately
an
idiot
how
could
one
dream
of
trusting
the
judgment
of
a
flunkey
about
a
lady
my
dear
excuse
the
familiarity
from
one
who
may
consider
himself
in
a
certain
sense
a
contingent
uncle
suppose
we
amend
the
last
clause
by
the
omission
of
the
word
it
strikes
me
as
superfluous
provided
always
the
said
harold
ashurst
tillington
consents
to
marry
i
think
that
sounds
better
he
looked
at
me
with
such
fatherly
regard
that
it
pricked
my
heart
ever
to
have
poked
fun
at
his
interpretation
of
prophecy
on
stock
exchange
principles
i
think
i
flushed
crimson
no
i
answered
firmly
will
not
do
either
please
that
worse
than
the
other
way
you
must
not
put
it
ashurst
i
could
not
consent
to
be
willed
away
to
anybody
he
leant
forward
with
real
earnestness
dear
he
said
not
the
point
pardon
my
reminding
you
that
you
are
here
in
your
capacity
as
my
amanuensis
i
am
drawing
up
my
will
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
i
can
not
admit
that
anyone
has
a
claim
to
influence
me
in
the
disposition
of
my
property
i
cried
pleadingly
he
looked
at
me
and
paused
he
went
on
at
last
after
a
long
interval
insist
upon
it
i
will
leave
the
bequest
to
stand
without
condition
you
i
murmured
bending
low
over
my
machine
i
did
as
i
like
though
he
went
on
should
say
unless
he
marries
miss
lois
cayley
who
is
a
deal
too
good
for
him
the
estate
shall
revert
to
kynaston
eldest
son
a
confounded
jackass
i
do
not
usually
indulge
in
intemperate
language
but
i
desire
to
assure
you
with
the
utmost
calmness
that
kynaston
eldest
son
lord
southminster
is
a
jackass
i
rose
and
took
his
hand
in
my
own
spontaneously
ashurst
i
said
may
interpret
prophecy
as
long
as
ever
you
like
but
you
are
a
dear
kind
old
gentleman
i
am
truly
grateful
to
you
for
your
good
opinion
you
will
marry
harold
i
answered
he
is
rich
i
have
said
as
much
to
him
hard
he
went
on
slowly
i
should
like
to
be
your
uncle
i
trembled
all
over
elsie
saved
the
situation
by
bursting
in
abruptly
i
will
only
add
that
when
ashurst
left
i
copied
the
will
out
neatly
without
erasures
the
rough
original
i
threw
somewhat
carelessly
into
the
basket
that
afternoon
somebody
called
to
fetch
the
fair
copy
for
ashurst
i
went
out
into
the
front
office
to
see
him
to
my
surprise
it
was
higginson
in
his
guise
as
courier
illustration
what
you
here
he
cried
he
was
as
astonished
as
myself
here
he
cried
dog
me
was
thinking
the
same
thing
of
you
le
comte
i
answered
curtsying
he
made
no
attempt
at
an
excuse
i
have
been
sent
for
the
will
he
broke
out
curtly
you
were
sent
for
the
i
retorted
no
am
in
charge
of
the
will
and
i
will
take
it
myself
to
mr
ashurst
will
be
even
with
you
yet
he
snapped
out
have
gone
back
to
my
old
trade
and
am
trying
to
lead
an
honest
life
but
wo
let
me
the
contrary
i
answered
smiling
a
polite
smile
rejoice
to
hear
it
if
you
say
nothing
more
against
me
to
your
employer
i
will
not
disclose
to
him
what
i
know
about
you
but
if
you
slander
me
i
will
so
now
we
understand
one
another
and
i
kept
the
will
till
i
could
give
it
myself
into
mr
ashurst
own
hands
in
his
rooms
that
evening
vii
the
adventure
of
the
unobtrusive
oasis
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
to
you
the
minor
episodes
of
our
next
twelve
months
the
manuscripts
we
and
the
manitous
we
sold
is
one
of
my
aims
in
a
world
so
rich
in
bores
to
avoid
being
tedious
i
will
merely
say
therefore
that
we
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
year
in
florence
where
we
were
building
up
a
connection
but
rode
back
for
the
summer
months
to
switzerland
as
being
a
livelier
place
for
the
trade
in
bicycles
the
net
result
was
not
only
that
we
covered
our
expenses
but
that
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
i
found
myself
with
a
surplus
in
hand
at
the
end
of
the
season
when
we
returned
to
florence
for
the
winter
however
i
confess
i
began
to
chafe
is
slow
work
elsie
i
said
started
out
to
go
round
the
world
it
has
taken
me
eighteen
months
to
travel
no
further
than
italy
at
this
rate
i
shall
reach
new
york
a
old
lady
in
a
nice
lace
cap
and
totter
back
into
london
a
venerable
crone
on
the
verge
of
ninety
however
those
invaluable
doctors
came
to
my
rescue
unexpectedly
i
do
love
doctors
they
are
always
sending
you
off
at
a
moment
notice
to
delightful
places
you
never
dreamt
of
elsie
was
better
but
still
far
from
strong
i
took
it
upon
me
to
consult
our
medical
attendant
and
his
verdict
was
decisive
he
did
just
what
a
doctor
ought
to
do
is
getting
on
very
well
in
florence
he
said
if
you
want
to
restore
her
health
completely
i
should
advise
you
to
take
her
for
a
winter
to
egypt
after
six
months
of
the
dry
warm
desert
air
i
do
doubt
she
might
return
to
her
work
in
london
that
last
point
i
used
as
a
lever
with
elsie
she
positively
revels
in
teaching
mathematics
at
first
to
be
sure
she
objected
that
we
had
only
just
money
enough
to
pay
our
way
to
cairo
and
that
when
we
got
there
we
might
starve
her
favourite
programme
i
have
not
this
extraordinary
taste
for
starving
idea
is
to
go
where
you
like
and
find
something
decent
to
eat
when
you
get
there
however
to
humour
her
i
began
to
cast
about
me
for
a
source
of
income
there
is
no
absolute
harm
in
seeing
your
way
clear
before
you
for
a
twelvemonth
though
of
course
it
deprives
you
of
the
of
poverty
i
said
in
my
best
didactic
style
i
excel
in
didactics
do
not
learn
from
the
lessons
that
life
sets
before
you
look
at
the
stage
for
example
the
stage
is
universally
acknowledged
at
the
present
day
to
be
a
great
teacher
of
morals
does
not
irving
say
so
and
he
ought
to
know
there
is
that
splendid
model
for
imitation
for
instance
the
clown
in
the
pantomime
how
does
clown
regulate
his
life
does
he
take
heed
for
the
morrow
not
a
bit
of
it
i
wish
i
had
a
goose
he
says
at
some
critical
juncture
and
just
as
he
says
it
pat
a
super
strolls
upon
the
stage
with
a
property
goose
on
a
wooden
tray
and
clown
cries
oh
look
here
joey
a
goose
and
proceeds
to
appropriate
it
then
he
puts
his
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
observes
i
wish
i
had
a
few
apples
to
make
the
sauce
with
and
as
the
words
escape
him
pat
again
a
small
boy
with
a
very
squeaky
voice
runs
on
carrying
a
basket
of
apples
clown
trips
him
up
and
bolts
with
the
basket
a
model
for
imitation
the
stage
sets
these
great
moral
lessons
before
you
regularly
every
christmas
yet
you
fail
to
profit
by
them
govern
your
life
on
the
principles
exemplified
by
clown
expect
to
find
that
whatever
you
want
will
turn
up
with
punctuality
and
dispatch
at
the
proper
moment
be
adventurous
and
you
will
be
happy
take
that
as
a
new
maxim
to
put
in
your
wish
i
could
think
so
dear
elsie
answered
your
confidence
staggers
me
that
evening
at
our
however
it
was
amply
justified
a
young
man
of
ample
girth
and
most
prosperous
exterior
happened
to
sit
next
us
he
had
his
wife
with
him
so
i
judged
it
safe
to
launch
on
conversation
we
soon
found
out
he
was
the
millionaire
of
a
great
london
daily
with
many
more
strings
to
his
journalistic
bow
his
honoured
name
was
elworthy
i
mentioned
casually
that
we
thought
of
going
for
the
winter
to
egypt
he
pricked
his
ears
up
but
at
the
time
he
said
nothing
after
dinner
we
adjourned
to
the
cosy
i
talked
to
him
and
his
wife
and
somehow
that
evening
the
devil
entered
into
me
i
am
subject
to
devils
i
hasten
to
add
they
are
mild
ones
i
had
one
of
my
reckless
moods
just
then
however
and
i
reeled
off
rattling
stories
of
our
various
adventures
elworthy
believed
in
youth
and
audacity
i
could
see
i
interested
him
the
more
he
was
amused
the
more
reckless
i
became
bright
he
said
at
last
when
i
told
him
the
tale
of
our
amateur
exploits
in
the
sale
of
manitous
would
make
a
good
article
i
answered
with
bravado
determined
to
strike
while
the
iron
was
hot
the
lacks
is
just
one
enlivening
touch
of
feminine
brightness
he
smiled
is
your
forte
he
inquired
forte
i
answered
to
go
where
i
choose
and
write
what
i
like
about
it
he
smiled
again
a
very
good
new
departure
in
journalism
too
a
roving
commission
have
you
ever
tried
your
hand
at
writing
had
i
ever
tried
it
was
the
ambition
of
my
life
to
see
myself
in
print
though
hitherto
it
had
been
ineffectual
have
written
a
few
sketches
i
answered
with
becoming
modesty
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
office
bulged
with
my
unpublished
manuscripts
you
let
me
see
them
he
asked
i
assented
with
inner
joy
but
outer
reluctance
you
wish
it
i
murmured
you
must
be
lenient
illustration
he
read
them
cruel
man
before
my
very
eyes
though
i
had
not
told
elsie
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
i
had
just
then
conceived
an
idea
for
a
novel
my
the
setting
of
which
compelled
egyptian
local
colour
and
i
was
therefore
dying
to
get
to
egypt
if
chance
so
willed
it
i
submitted
a
few
of
my
picked
manuscripts
accordingly
to
elworthy
in
fear
and
trembling
he
read
them
cruel
man
before
my
very
eyes
i
sat
and
waited
twiddling
my
thumbs
demure
but
apprehensive
when
he
had
finished
he
laid
them
down
he
said
you
quite
right
miss
cayley
that
just
what
we
want
on
the
i
should
like
to
print
these
three
selecting
them
out
our
usual
rate
of
pay
per
thousand
are
very
kind
but
the
room
reeled
with
me
at
all
i
am
a
man
of
business
and
these
are
good
copy
now
about
this
egypt
i
will
put
the
matter
in
the
shape
of
a
business
proposition
will
you
undertake
if
i
pay
your
passage
and
your
friend
with
all
travelling
expenses
to
let
me
have
three
descriptive
articles
a
week
on
cairo
the
nile
syria
and
india
running
to
about
two
thousand
words
apiece
at
three
guineas
a
thousand
my
breath
came
and
went
it
was
positive
opulence
the
super
with
the
goose
could
approach
it
for
patness
my
editor
had
brought
me
the
apple
sauce
as
well
without
even
giving
me
the
trouble
of
cooking
it
the
very
next
day
everything
was
arranged
elsie
tried
to
protest
on
the
foolish
ground
that
she
had
no
money
but
the
faculty
had
ordered
the
apex
of
her
right
lung
to
go
to
egypt
and
i
could
let
her
fly
in
the
face
of
the
faculty
we
secured
our
berths
in
a
and
steamer
from
brindisi
and
within
a
week
we
were
tossing
upon
the
bosom
of
the
blue
mediterranean
people
who
have
crossed
the
blue
mediterranean
cherish
an
absurd
idea
that
it
is
always
calm
and
warm
and
sunny
i
am
sorry
to
take
away
any
sea
character
but
i
speak
of
it
as
i
find
it
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
my
old
gyp
at
girton
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
the
mediterranean
did
not
treat
me
as
a
lady
expects
to
be
treated
it
behaved
disgracefully
people
may
rhapsodize
as
long
as
they
choose
about
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
for
my
own
part
i
would
give
a
pin
for
we
glided
down
the
adriatic
from
brindisi
to
corfu
with
a
reckless
profusion
of
lateral
motion
which
suggested
the
idea
that
the
ship
must
have
been
drinking
i
tried
to
rouse
elsie
when
we
came
abreast
of
the
ionian
islands
and
to
remind
her
that
was
the
home
of
nausicaa
in
the
odyssey
elsie
failed
to
respond
she
was
otherwise
occupied
at
last
i
succumbed
and
gave
it
up
i
remember
nothing
further
till
a
day
and
a
half
later
when
we
got
under
lee
of
crete
and
the
ship
showed
a
tendency
to
resume
the
perpendicular
then
i
began
once
more
to
take
a
languid
interest
in
the
dinner
question
i
may
add
parenthetically
that
the
mediterranean
is
a
mere
bit
of
a
sea
when
you
look
at
it
on
the
map
a
pocket
sea
to
be
regarded
with
mingled
contempt
and
affection
but
you
learn
to
respect
it
when
you
find
that
it
takes
four
clear
days
and
nights
of
abject
misery
merely
to
run
across
its
eastern
basin
from
brindisi
to
alexandria
i
respected
the
mediterranean
immensely
while
we
lay
off
the
peloponnesus
in
the
trough
of
the
waves
with
a
north
wind
blowing
i
only
began
to
temper
my
respect
with
a
distant
liking
when
we
passed
under
the
welcome
shelter
of
crete
on
a
calm
evening
it
was
deadly
cold
we
had
not
counted
upon
such
weather
in
the
sunny
south
i
recollected
now
that
the
greeks
were
wont
to
represent
boreas
as
a
chilly
deity
and
spoke
of
the
thracian
breeze
with
the
same
deferentially
deprecating
adjectives
which
we
ourselves
apply
to
the
east
wind
of
our
fatherland
but
that
apt
classical
memory
somehow
failed
to
console
or
warm
me
a
male
passenger
however
volunteered
to
ask
us
i
get
ye
a
rug
ladies
the
form
of
his
courteous
question
suggested
the
probability
of
his
irish
origin
are
very
kind
i
answered
you
do
want
it
for
yourself
sure
my
friend
would
be
glad
to
have
the
use
of
it
it
meself
sure
i
got
me
big
ulsther
and
i
as
warrum
as
a
toast
in
it
but
ye
not
provided
for
this
weather
ye
thrusted
too
much
to
those
rascals
the
breaks
the
blue
sicilian
say
the
rogues
write
like
to
set
them
down
in
it
wid
a
blowing
he
fetched
up
his
rug
it
was
ample
and
soft
a
smooth
brown
he
wrapped
us
both
up
in
it
we
sat
late
on
deck
that
night
as
warm
as
a
toast
ourselves
thanks
to
our
genial
irishman
illustration
is
doctor
macloghlen
he
answered
we
asked
his
name
macloghlen
he
answered
from
county
clare
ye
see
and
i
on
me
way
to
egypt
for
thravel
and
exploration
me
fader
whisht
me
to
see
the
worruld
a
bit
before
i
settle
down
to
practise
me
profession
at
liscannor
have
ye
ever
been
in
county
clare
sure
is
the
pick
of
oireland
have
that
pleasure
still
in
store
i
answered
smiling
spreads
over
the
future
as
george
meredith
puts
it
it
meredith
ah
there
the
foine
writer
is
jaynius
the
man
has
i
ca
undtherstand
a
word
of
him
but
he
half
oirish
ye
know
what
proof
have
i
got
of
it
an
would
he
write
like
that
if
there
was
a
dhrop
of
the
blood
of
the
celt
in
him
next
day
and
next
night
macloghlen
was
our
devoted
slave
i
had
won
his
heart
by
admitting
frankly
that
his
countrywomen
had
the
finest
and
liveliest
eyes
in
europe
eyes
with
a
deep
twinkle
half
fun
half
passion
he
took
to
us
at
once
and
talked
to
us
incessantly
he
was
a
but
a
real
good
fellow
we
forgot
the
aggressive
inequalities
of
the
mediterranean
while
he
talked
to
us
of
pizzantry
late
the
second
evening
he
propounded
a
confidence
it
was
a
lovely
night
orion
overhead
and
the
plashing
phosphorescence
on
the
water
below
conspired
with
the
hour
to
make
him
specially
confidential
miss
cayley
he
said
leaning
forward
on
his
deck
chair
and
gazing
earnestly
into
my
eyes
wan
question
i
like
to
ask
ye
the
ambition
of
me
life
is
to
get
into
parlimint
and
i
want
to
know
from
ye
as
a
frind
if
i
accomplish
me
heart
wish
is
there
annything
in
me
apparence
ar
in
me
voice
ar
in
me
accent
ar
in
me
manner
that
would
lade
annybody
to
suppose
i
was
an
oirishman
i
succeeded
by
good
luck
in
avoiding
elsie
eye
what
on
earth
could
i
answer
then
a
happy
thought
struck
me
macloghlen
i
said
would
not
be
the
slightest
use
your
trying
to
conceal
it
for
even
if
nobody
ever
detected
a
faint
irish
intonation
in
your
words
or
phrases
how
could
your
eloquence
fail
to
betray
you
for
a
countryman
of
sheridan
and
burke
and
grattan
he
seized
my
hand
with
such
warmth
that
i
thought
it
best
to
hurry
down
to
my
at
once
under
cover
of
my
compliment
at
alexandria
and
cairo
we
found
him
invaluable
he
looked
after
our
luggage
which
he
gallantly
rescued
from
the
lean
hands
of
fifteen
arab
porters
all
eagerly
struggling
to
gain
possession
of
our
effects
he
saw
us
safe
into
the
train
and
he
never
quitted
us
till
he
had
safely
ensconced
us
in
our
rooms
at
shepheard
for
himself
he
said
with
subdued
melancholy
was
to
some
cheaper
hotel
he
must
go
was
for
the
likes
of
him
though
if
land
in
county
clare
was
what
it
ought
to
be
there
was
a
finer
estate
in
all
oireland
than
his
fader
our
elworthy
was
a
modern
proprietor
who
knew
how
to
do
things
on
the
lordly
scale
having
commissioned
me
to
write
this
series
of
articles
he
intended
them
to
be
written
in
the
first
style
of
art
and
he
had
instructed
me
accordingly
to
hire
one
of
cook
little
steam
dahabeeahs
where
i
could
work
at
leisure
macloghlen
was
in
his
element
arranging
for
the
trip
the
only
thing
i
mind
he
said
that
i
not
be
going
wid
ye
i
think
he
was
half
inclined
to
invite
himself
but
there
again
i
drew
a
line
i
will
not
sell
salt
fish
and
i
will
not
go
up
the
nile
unchaperoned
with
a
casual
man
acquaintance
he
did
the
next
best
thing
however
he
took
a
place
in
a
sailing
dahabeeah
and
as
we
steamed
up
slowly
stopping
often
on
the
way
to
give
me
time
to
write
my
articles
he
managed
to
arrive
almost
always
at
every
town
or
ruin
exactly
when
we
did
i
will
not
describe
the
voyage
the
nile
is
the
nile
just
at
first
before
we
got
used
to
it
we
conscientiously
looked
up
the
name
of
every
village
we
passed
on
the
bank
in
our
murray
and
our
baedeker
after
a
couple
of
days
niling
however
we
found
that
formality
quite
unnecessary
they
were
all
the
same
village
under
a
number
of
aliases
they
did
not
even
take
the
trouble
to
disguise
themselves
anew
like
on
each
fresh
appearance
they
had
every
one
of
them
a
small
whitewashed
mosque
with
a
couple
of
tall
minarets
and
around
it
spread
a
number
of
cottages
looking
more
like
than
human
habitations
they
had
also
every
one
of
them
a
group
of
overhanging
a
cluster
of
mean
bare
houses
and
they
all
alike
had
a
picturesque
and
even
imposing
air
from
a
distance
but
faded
away
into
indescribable
squalor
as
one
got
abreast
of
them
our
progress
was
monotonous
at
twelve
noon
we
would
pass
with
its
mosque
its
palms
its
and
its
camels
then
for
a
couple
of
hours
we
would
go
on
through
the
midst
of
a
green
field
on
either
side
studded
by
more
and
backed
up
by
a
range
of
gray
desert
mountains
only
to
come
at
twenty
miles
higher
up
upon
once
more
with
the
same
mosque
the
same
and
the
same
haughty
camels
placidly
chewing
the
same
aristocratic
cud
but
under
the
alias
of
after
a
wild
hubbub
at
the
quay
we
would
leave
behind
with
its
camels
still
serenely
munching
dinner
and
twenty
miles
further
on
again
having
passed
through
the
same
green
plain
backed
by
the
same
gray
mountains
we
would
stop
once
more
at
the
identical
which
this
time
absurdly
described
itself
as
tahtah
but
whether
it
was
or
or
tahtah
or
anything
else
only
the
name
differed
it
was
always
the
same
town
and
had
always
the
same
camels
at
precisely
the
same
stage
of
the
digestive
process
it
seemed
to
us
immaterial
whether
you
saw
all
the
nile
or
only
five
miles
of
it
it
was
just
like
a
sample
sufficed
the
whole
was
the
sample
infinitely
repeated
however
i
had
my
letters
to
write
and
i
wrote
them
valiantly
i
described
the
various
episodes
of
the
complicated
digestive
process
in
the
camel
in
the
minutest
detail
i
gloated
over
the
which
i
knew
in
three
days
as
if
i
had
been
brought
up
upon
dates
i
gave
of
every
individual
child
veiled
woman
arab
sheikh
and
coptic
priest
whom
we
encountered
on
the
voyage
and
i
am
open
to
reprint
those
conscientious
studies
of
and
minarets
with
any
enterprising
publisher
who
will
make
me
an
offer
illustration
too
much
nile
another
disillusion
weighed
upon
my
soul
before
i
went
up
the
nile
i
had
a
fancy
of
my
own
that
the
bank
was
studded
with
endless
ruined
temples
whose
vast
red
colonnades
were
reflected
in
the
water
at
every
turn
i
think
macaulay
lays
were
primarily
answerable
for
that
particular
misapprehension
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
surprised
me
to
find
that
we
often
went
for
two
whole
days
hard
steaming
without
ever
a
temple
breaking
the
monotony
of
those
eternal
those
calm
and
superciliously
irresponsive
camels
in
my
humble
opinion
egypt
is
a
fraud
there
is
too
much
nile
very
dirty
nile
at
that
and
not
nearly
enough
temple
besides
the
temples
when
you
come
up
with
them
are
just
like
the
villages
they
are
the
same
temple
over
again
under
a
different
name
each
time
and
they
have
the
same
gods
the
same
kings
the
same
wearisome
except
that
the
gentleman
in
a
chariot
ten
feet
high
who
is
mowing
down
enemies
a
quarter
his
own
size
with
unsportsmanslike
recklessness
is
called
rameses
in
this
place
and
sethi
in
that
and
in
the
other
with
this
trifling
variation
when
you
have
seen
one
temple
one
obelisk
one
hieroglyphic
table
you
have
seen
the
whole
of
ancient
egypt
at
last
after
many
days
voyage
through
the
same
scenery
daily
rising
in
the
morning
off
a
village
with
a
mosque
ten
palms
and
two
minarets
and
retiring
late
at
night
off
the
same
village
once
more
with
mosque
palms
and
minarets
as
before
we
arrived
one
evening
at
a
place
called
geergeh
in
itself
i
believe
geergeh
did
not
differ
materially
from
all
the
other
places
we
had
passed
on
our
voyage
it
had
its
mosque
its
ten
palms
and
its
two
minarets
as
usual
but
i
remember
its
name
because
something
mysterious
went
wrong
there
with
our
machinery
and
the
engineer
informed
us
we
must
wait
at
least
three
days
to
mend
it
macloghlen
dahabeeah
happened
opportunely
to
arrive
at
the
same
spot
on
the
same
day
and
he
declared
with
fervour
he
would
us
through
our
throubles
but
what
on
earth
were
we
to
do
with
ourselves
through
three
long
days
and
nights
at
geergeh
there
were
the
ruins
of
abydus
close
at
hand
to
be
sure
though
i
defy
anybody
not
a
professed
egyptologist
to
give
more
than
one
day
to
the
ruins
of
abydus
in
this
emergency
macloghlen
came
gallantly
to
our
aid
he
discovered
by
inquiring
from
an
guide
that
there
was
an
unobtrusive
oasis
never
visited
by
europeans
one
long
day
journey
off
across
the
desert
as
a
rule
it
takes
at
least
three
days
to
get
camels
and
guides
together
for
such
an
expedition
for
egypt
is
not
a
land
to
hurry
in
but
the
indefatigable
doctor
further
unearthed
the
fact
that
a
sheikh
had
just
come
in
who
for
a
consideration
would
lend
us
camels
for
a
two
days
trip
and
we
seized
the
chance
to
do
our
duty
by
elworthy
and
the
circulation
an
unvisited
oasis
and
two
christian
ladies
to
be
the
first
to
explore
it
journalistic
enterprise
for
you
if
we
happened
to
be
killed
so
much
the
better
for
the
i
pictured
the
excitement
at
piccadilly
circus
special
our
own
correspondent
brutally
murdered
i
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
elsie
rejoiced
with
me
she
cherished
a
prejudice
against
camels
massacres
and
the
new
journalism
she
like
being
murdered
though
this
was
premature
for
she
had
never
tried
it
she
objected
that
the
fanatical
mohammedans
of
the
senoosi
sect
who
were
said
to
inhabit
the
oasis
in
question
might
cut
our
throats
for
dogs
of
infidels
i
pointed
out
to
her
at
some
length
that
it
was
just
that
chance
which
added
zest
to
our
expedition
as
a
journalistic
venture
fancy
the
glory
of
being
the
first
lady
journalists
martyred
in
the
cause
but
she
failed
to
grasp
this
aspect
of
the
question
however
if
i
went
she
would
go
too
she
said
like
a
dear
girl
that
she
is
she
would
not
desert
me
when
i
was
getting
my
throat
cut
illustration
emphasis
macloghlen
made
the
bargain
for
us
and
insisted
on
accompanying
us
across
the
desert
he
told
us
his
method
of
negotiation
with
the
arabs
with
extreme
gusto
is
it
pay
in
advance
ye
want
says
i
to
the
dirty
beggars
divvil
a
penny
will
ye
get
till
ye
bring
these
ladies
safe
back
to
geergeh
and
remimber
sheikh
says
i
fingering
me
pistol
so
by
way
of
emphasis
we
take
no
money
wid
us
so
if
yer
friends
at
wadi
bou
choose
to
cut
our
throats
is
for
the
pleasure
of
it
be
cutting
them
not
for
anything
they
gain
by
it
provisions
effendi
says
he
salaaming
provisions
is
it
says
i
take
everything
ye
want
wid
you
i
suppose
ye
can
buy
food
fit
for
a
crischun
in
the
bazaar
in
geergeh
and
never
wan
penny
do
ye
touch
for
it
all
till
ye
landed
us
on
the
bank
again
as
safe
as
ye
took
us
so
if
the
religious
sintiments
of
the
faithful
at
wadi
bou
should
lade
them
to
hack
us
to
pieces
says
i
just
waving
me
revolver
thin
is
yerself
that
will
be
out
of
pocket
by
it
and
the
ould
divvil
cringed
as
if
he
took
me
for
the
prince
of
wales
faix
is
the
purse
the
best
argumint
to
catch
these
haythen
arabs
upon
when
we
set
out
for
the
desert
in
the
early
dawn
next
day
it
looked
as
if
we
were
starting
for
a
few
months
voyage
we
had
a
company
of
camels
that
might
have
befitted
a
caravan
we
had
two
large
tents
one
for
ourselves
and
one
for
macloghlen
with
a
third
to
dine
in
we
had
bedding
and
cushions
and
drinking
water
tied
up
in
swollen
which
were
really
looking
far
from
tempting
we
had
bread
and
meat
and
a
supply
of
presents
to
soften
the
hearts
and
weaken
the
religious
scruples
of
the
sheikhs
at
wadi
bou
thravel
said
the
doctor
when
all
was
ready
we
got
under
way
solemnly
our
camels
rising
and
sniffing
the
breeze
with
a
superior
air
as
who
should
say
happen
to
be
going
where
you
happen
to
be
going
but
do
for
a
moment
suppose
i
do
it
to
please
you
it
is
mere
coincidence
you
are
bound
for
wadi
bou
i
have
business
of
my
own
which
chances
to
take
me
there
illustration
riding
a
camel
does
not
greatly
differ
prom
over
the
incidents
of
the
journey
i
draw
a
veil
riding
a
camel
i
find
does
not
greatly
differ
from
they
are
the
same
phenomenon
under
altered
circumstances
we
had
been
assured
beforehand
on
excellent
authority
that
of
the
comfort
on
a
desert
journey
depends
upon
having
a
good
camel
on
this
matter
i
am
no
authority
i
do
not
set
up
as
a
judge
of
but
i
did
not
notice
of
the
comfort
so
i
venture
to
believe
my
camel
must
have
been
an
exceptionally
bad
one
we
expected
trouble
from
the
fanatical
natives
i
am
bound
to
admit
we
had
most
trouble
with
elsie
she
was
not
insubordinate
but
she
did
not
care
for
and
her
beast
took
advantage
of
her
youth
and
innocence
a
camel
should
go
almost
as
fast
as
a
child
can
walk
and
should
not
sit
down
plump
on
the
burning
sand
without
due
reason
elsie
brute
crawled
and
called
halts
for
prayer
at
frequent
intervals
it
tried
to
kneel
like
a
good
mussulman
many
times
a
day
and
it
showed
an
intolerant
disposition
to
crush
the
infidel
by
rolling
over
on
top
of
elsie
macloghlen
admonished
it
with
irish
eloquence
not
always
in
language
intended
for
publication
but
it
only
turned
up
its
supercilious
lip
and
inquired
in
its
own
unspoken
tongue
what
knew
about
the
desert
feel
like
a
wurrum
before
the
baste
the
doctor
said
nonplussed
if
the
nile
was
monotonous
the
road
to
wadi
bou
was
nothing
short
of
dreary
we
crossed
a
great
ridge
of
bare
gray
rock
and
followed
a
rolling
valley
of
sand
scored
by
dry
ravines
and
baking
in
the
sun
it
was
ghastly
to
look
upon
all
day
long
save
at
the
midday
rest
by
some
brackish
wells
we
rode
on
and
on
the
brutes
stepping
forward
with
slow
outstretched
legs
though
sometimes
we
walked
by
the
camels
sides
to
vary
the
monotony
but
ever
through
that
dreary
upland
plain
sand
in
the
centre
rocky
mountain
at
the
edge
and
not
a
thing
to
look
at
we
were
relieved
towards
evening
to
stumble
against
stunted
tamarisks
half
buried
in
sand
and
to
feel
we
were
approaching
the
edge
of
the
oasis
when
at
last
our
arrogant
beasts
condescended
to
stop
in
their
patronising
way
we
saw
by
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
a
sort
of
uneven
basin
or
hollow
studded
with
and
in
the
midst
of
the
depression
a
crumbling
walled
town
with
a
whitewashed
mosque
two
minarets
by
its
side
and
a
crowd
of
it
was
strangely
familiar
we
had
come
all
this
way
just
to
see
or
over
again
we
camped
outside
the
fortified
town
that
night
next
morning
we
essayed
to
make
our
entry
at
first
the
servants
of
the
prophet
on
watch
at
the
gate
raised
serious
objections
no
infidel
might
enter
but
we
had
a
pass
from
cairo
exhorting
the
faithful
in
the
name
of
the
khedive
to
give
us
food
and
shelter
and
after
much
examination
and
many
loud
discussions
the
gatemen
passed
us
we
entered
the
town
and
stood
alone
three
christian
europeans
in
the
midst
of
three
thousand
fanatical
mohammedans
i
confess
it
was
weird
elsie
shrank
by
my
side
they
were
to
attack
us
brownie
the
sheikh
here
would
never
get
paid
macloghlen
put
in
with
true
irish
recklessness
he
whistle
for
his
money
on
the
whistle
i
gave
him
that
touch
of
humour
saved
us
we
laughed
and
the
people
about
saw
we
could
laugh
they
left
off
scowling
and
pressed
around
trying
to
sell
us
pottery
and
native
brooches
in
the
intervals
of
fanaticism
the
arab
has
an
eye
to
business
we
passed
up
the
chief
street
of
the
bazaar
the
inhabitants
told
us
in
pantomime
the
chief
of
the
town
was
away
at
asioot
whither
he
had
gone
two
days
ago
on
business
if
he
were
here
our
interpreter
gave
us
to
understand
things
might
have
been
different
for
the
chief
had
determined
that
whatever
came
no
infidel
dog
should
settle
in
oasis
illustration
her
agitation
was
evident
the
women
with
their
veiled
faces
attracted
us
strangely
they
were
wilder
than
on
the
river
they
ran
when
one
looked
at
them
suddenly
as
we
passed
one
we
saw
her
give
a
little
start
she
was
veiled
like
the
rest
but
her
agitation
was
evident
even
through
her
thick
covering
is
afraid
of
christians
elsie
cried
nestling
towards
me
the
woman
passed
close
to
us
she
never
looked
in
our
direction
but
in
a
very
low
voice
she
murmured
as
she
passed
you
are
english
i
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
conceal
my
surprise
at
this
unexpected
utterance
seem
to
notice
her
elsie
i
said
looking
away
we
are
english
she
stopped
and
pretended
to
examine
some
jewellery
on
a
stall
am
i
she
went
on
in
the
same
suppressed
low
voice
heaven
sake
help
me
are
you
doing
here
live
here
married
i
was
with
gordon
force
at
khartoum
they
carried
me
off
a
mere
girl
then
now
i
am
thirty
you
have
been
here
ever
since
she
turned
away
and
walked
off
but
kept
whispering
behind
her
veil
we
followed
unobtrusively
i
was
sold
to
a
man
at
dongola
he
passed
me
on
again
to
the
chief
of
this
oasis
i
do
know
where
it
is
but
i
have
been
here
ever
since
i
hate
this
life
is
there
any
chance
of
a
rescue
chance
of
a
rescue
is
it
the
doctor
broke
in
a
trifle
too
ostensibly
it
costs
us
a
whole
british
army
me
dear
lady
fetch
you
away
and
save
you
now
you
wo
go
away
and
leave
me
you
are
the
first
europeans
i
have
seen
since
khartoum
fell
they
may
sell
me
again
you
will
not
desert
me
i
said
will
not
then
i
reflected
a
moment
what
on
earth
could
we
do
this
was
a
painful
dilemma
if
we
once
lost
sight
of
her
we
might
not
see
her
again
yet
if
we
walked
with
her
openly
and
talked
like
friends
we
would
betray
ourselves
and
her
to
those
fanatical
senoosis
i
made
my
mind
up
promptly
i
may
not
have
much
of
a
mind
but
such
as
it
is
i
flatter
myself
i
can
make
it
up
at
a
moment
notice
you
come
to
us
outside
the
gate
at
sunset
i
asked
as
if
speaking
to
elsie
the
woman
hesitated
think
so
keep
us
in
sight
all
day
and
when
evening
comes
stroll
out
behind
us
she
turned
over
some
embroidered
slippers
on
a
booth
and
seemed
to
be
inspecting
them
my
children
she
murmured
anxiously
the
doctor
interposed
it
childern
she
has
he
asked
be
the
mohammedan
gintleman
we
must
interfere
wid
we
can
take
away
the
lady
she
english
and
detained
against
her
will
but
we
ca
deprive
anny
man
of
his
own
childern
i
was
firm
and
categorical
we
can
i
said
stoutly
he
has
forced
a
woman
to
bear
them
to
him
whether
she
would
or
not
common
justice
i
have
no
respect
for
the
mohammedan
gentleman
rights
let
her
bring
them
with
her
how
many
are
there
a
boy
and
girl
not
very
old
the
eldest
is
seven
she
spoke
wistfully
a
mother
is
a
mother
say
no
more
now
but
keep
us
always
in
sight
and
we
will
keep
come
to
us
at
the
gate
about
sundown
we
will
carry
you
off
with
us
she
clasped
her
hands
and
moved
off
with
the
peculiar
gliding
air
of
the
veiled
mohammedan
woman
our
eyes
followed
her
we
walked
on
through
the
bazaar
thinking
of
nothing
else
now
it
was
strange
how
this
episode
made
us
forget
our
selfish
fears
for
our
own
safety
even
dear
timid
elsie
remembered
only
that
an
englishwoman
life
and
liberty
were
at
stake
we
kept
her
more
or
less
in
view
all
day
she
glided
in
and
out
among
the
people
in
the
alleys
when
we
went
back
to
the
camels
at
she
followed
us
unobtrusively
through
the
open
gate
and
sat
watching
us
from
a
little
way
off
among
a
crowd
of
gazers
for
all
wadi
bou
was
of
course
agog
at
this
unwonted
invasion
we
discussed
the
circumstance
loudly
so
that
she
might
hear
our
plans
macloghlen
advised
that
we
should
tell
our
sheikh
we
meant
to
return
part
of
the
way
to
geergeh
that
evening
by
moonlight
i
quite
agreed
with
him
it
was
the
only
way
out
besides
i
did
like
the
looks
of
the
people
they
eyed
us
askance
this
was
getting
exciting
now
i
felt
a
professional
journalistic
interest
whether
we
escaped
or
got
killed
what
splendid
business
for
the
the
sheikh
of
course
declared
it
was
impossible
to
start
that
evening
the
men
would
move
the
camels
needed
rest
but
macloghlen
was
inexorable
well
thin
sheikh
he
answered
philosophically
plaze
yerself
about
whether
ye
come
on
wid
us
or
whether
ye
shtop
that
yer
own
business
but
set
out
at
sundown
and
whin
ye
return
by
yerself
on
foot
to
geergeh
ye
can
ask
for
yer
camels
at
the
british
consulate
all
through
that
anxious
afternoon
we
sat
in
our
tents
under
the
shade
of
the
wondering
whether
we
could
carry
out
our
plan
or
not
about
an
hour
before
sunset
the
veiled
woman
strolled
out
of
the
gate
with
her
two
children
she
joined
the
crowd
of
once
more
for
never
through
the
day
were
we
left
alone
for
a
second
the
excitement
grew
intense
elsie
and
i
moved
up
carelessly
towards
the
group
talking
as
if
to
one
another
i
looked
hard
at
elsie
then
i
said
as
though
i
were
speaking
about
one
of
the
children
straight
along
the
road
to
geergeh
till
you
are
past
the
big
clump
of
palms
at
the
edge
of
the
oasis
just
beyond
it
comes
a
sharp
ridge
of
rock
wait
behind
the
ridge
where
no
one
can
see
you
when
we
get
there
i
patted
the
little
girl
head
say
a
word
but
jump
on
my
camel
my
two
friends
will
each
take
one
of
the
children
if
you
understand
and
consent
stroke
your
boy
curls
we
will
accept
that
for
a
signal
she
stroked
the
child
head
at
once
without
the
least
hesitation
even
through
her
veil
and
behind
her
dress
i
could
somehow
feel
and
see
her
trembling
nerves
her
beating
heart
but
she
gave
no
overt
token
she
merely
turned
and
muttered
something
carelessly
in
arabic
to
a
woman
beside
her
we
waited
once
more
in
suspense
would
she
manage
to
escape
them
would
they
suspect
her
motives
after
ten
minutes
when
we
had
returned
to
our
under
the
shadow
of
the
wall
the
woman
detached
herself
slowly
from
the
group
and
began
strolling
with
almost
overdone
nonchalance
along
the
road
to
geergeh
we
could
see
the
little
girl
was
frightened
and
seemed
to
expostulate
with
her
mother
fortunately
the
arabs
about
were
too
much
occupied
in
watching
the
suspicious
strangers
to
notice
this
episode
of
their
own
people
presently
our
new
friend
disappeared
and
with
beating
hearts
we
awaited
the
sunset
illustration
crouching
by
the
rocks
sat
our
mysterious
stranger
then
came
the
usual
scene
of
hubbub
with
the
sheikh
the
camels
the
porters
and
the
drivers
it
was
eagerness
against
apathy
with
difficulty
we
made
them
understand
we
meant
to
get
under
way
at
all
hazards
i
stormed
in
bad
arabic
the
doctor
inveighed
in
very
choice
irish
at
last
they
yielded
and
set
out
one
by
one
the
camels
rose
bent
their
slow
knees
and
began
to
stalk
in
their
lordly
way
with
outstretched
necks
along
the
road
to
the
river
we
moved
through
the
palm
groves
a
crowd
of
boys
following
us
and
shouting
for
backsheesh
we
began
to
be
afraid
they
would
accompany
us
too
far
and
discover
our
fugitive
but
fortunately
they
all
turned
back
with
one
accord
at
a
little
whitewashed
shrine
near
the
edge
of
the
oasis
we
reached
the
clump
of
palms
we
turned
the
corner
of
the
ridge
had
we
missed
one
another
no
there
crouching
by
the
rocks
with
her
children
by
her
side
sat
our
mysterious
stranger
the
doctor
was
equal
to
the
emergency
those
bastes
kneel
he
cried
authoritatively
to
the
sheikh
the
sheikh
was
taken
aback
this
was
a
new
exploit
burst
upon
him
he
flung
his
arms
up
gesticulating
wildly
the
doctor
unmoved
made
the
drivers
understand
by
some
strange
pantomime
what
he
wanted
they
nodded
half
terrified
in
a
second
the
stranger
was
by
my
side
elsie
had
taken
the
girl
the
doctor
the
boy
and
the
camels
were
passively
beginning
to
rise
again
that
is
the
best
of
your
camel
once
set
him
on
his
road
and
he
goes
mechanically
the
sheikh
broke
out
with
several
loud
remarks
in
arabic
which
we
did
not
understand
but
whose
hostile
character
could
not
easily
escape
us
he
was
beside
himself
with
anger
then
i
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
splendid
advantage
of
having
an
irishman
on
our
side
macloghlen
drew
his
revolver
like
one
well
used
to
such
episodes
and
pointed
it
full
at
the
angry
arab
here
sheikh
he
said
calmly
yet
with
a
fine
touch
of
bravado
ye
see
this
revolver
well
unless
ye
make
yer
camels
thravel
sthraight
to
geergeh
widout
wan
other
wurrud
yer
own
brains
will
be
spattered
sor
on
the
sand
of
this
desert
and
if
ye
touch
wan
hair
of
our
heads
ye
answer
for
it
wid
yer
life
to
the
british
government
i
do
not
feel
sure
that
the
sheikh
comprehended
the
exact
nature
of
each
word
in
this
comprehensive
threat
but
i
am
certain
he
took
in
its
general
meaning
punctuated
as
it
was
with
some
flourishes
of
the
revolver
he
turned
to
the
drivers
and
made
a
gesture
of
despair
it
meant
apparently
that
this
infidel
was
too
much
for
him
then
he
called
out
a
few
sharp
directions
in
arabic
next
minute
our
legs
were
stepping
out
briskly
along
the
road
to
geergeh
with
a
promptitude
which
i
sure
must
have
astonished
their
owners
we
rode
on
and
on
through
the
gloom
in
a
fever
of
suspense
had
any
of
the
senoosis
noticed
our
presence
would
they
miss
the
chief
wife
before
long
and
follow
us
under
arms
would
our
own
sheikh
betray
us
i
am
no
coward
as
women
go
but
i
confess
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
fiery
irishman
i
should
have
felt
my
heart
sink
we
were
grateful
to
him
for
the
reckless
and
courage
of
the
untamed
celt
it
kept
us
from
giving
way
take
notice
sheikh
he
said
as
we
threaded
our
way
among
the
rocks
i
have
cartridges
in
me
case
for
me
revolver
and
that
if
there
throuble
is
twinty
of
them
there
be
for
your
frinds
the
senoosis
and
wan
for
yerself
but
for
fear
of
disappointing
a
gintleman
is
yer
own
special
bullet
disthribute
first
if
it
comes
to
fighting
the
sheikh
english
was
a
vanishing
quantity
but
to
judge
by
the
way
he
nodded
and
salaamed
at
this
playful
remark
i
am
convinced
he
understood
the
doctor
irish
quite
as
well
as
i
did
we
spoke
little
by
the
way
we
were
all
far
too
frightened
except
the
doctor
who
kept
our
hearts
up
by
a
running
fire
of
wild
celtic
humour
but
i
found
time
meanwhile
to
learn
by
a
few
questions
from
our
veiled
friend
something
of
her
captivity
she
had
seen
her
father
massacred
before
her
eyes
at
khartoum
and
had
then
been
sold
away
to
a
merchant
who
conveyed
her
by
degrees
and
by
various
exchanges
across
the
desert
through
lonely
spots
to
the
senoosi
oasis
there
she
had
lived
all
those
years
with
the
chief
to
whom
her
last
purchaser
had
trafficked
her
she
did
not
even
know
that
her
husband
village
was
an
integral
part
of
the
khedive
territory
far
less
that
the
english
were
now
in
practical
occupation
of
egypt
she
had
heard
nothing
and
learnt
nothing
since
that
fateful
day
she
had
waited
in
vain
for
the
of
a
deliverer
did
you
never
try
to
run
away
to
the
nile
i
cried
astonished
away
how
could
i
i
did
not
even
know
which
way
the
river
lay
and
was
it
possible
for
me
to
cross
the
desert
on
foot
or
find
the
chance
of
a
camel
the
senoosis
would
have
killed
me
even
with
you
to
help
me
see
what
dangers
surround
me
alone
i
should
have
perished
like
hagar
in
the
wilderness
with
no
angel
to
save
me
ye
got
the
angel
now
macloghlen
exclaimed
glancing
at
me
there
sheikh
what
this
that
coming
it
was
another
caravan
going
the
opposite
way
on
its
road
to
the
oasis
a
voice
halloaed
from
it
our
new
friend
clung
tight
to
me
husband
she
whispered
gasping
they
were
still
far
off
on
the
desert
and
the
moon
shone
bright
a
few
hurried
words
to
the
doctor
and
with
a
wild
resolve
we
faced
the
emergency
he
made
the
camels
halt
and
all
of
us
springing
off
crouched
down
behind
their
shadows
in
such
a
way
that
the
coming
caravan
must
pass
on
the
far
side
of
us
at
the
same
moment
the
doctor
turned
resolutely
to
the
sheikh
here
arab
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
with
one
more
appeal
to
the
simple
volapuk
of
the
pointed
revolver
cover
ye
wid
this
let
these
frinds
of
yours
go
by
if
there
anny
unnecessary
talking
betwixt
ye
or
anny
throuble
of
anny
kind
remimber
the
first
bullet
goes
sthraight
as
an
arrow
that
haythen
head
of
yours
the
sheikh
salaamed
more
submissively
than
ever
the
caravan
drew
abreast
of
us
we
could
hear
them
cry
aloud
on
either
side
the
customary
salutes
allah
name
peace
answered
by
is
great
there
is
no
god
but
allah
would
anything
more
happen
would
our
sheikh
play
us
false
it
was
a
moment
of
breathlessness
we
crouched
and
cowered
in
the
shade
holding
our
hearts
with
fear
while
the
arab
drivers
pretended
to
be
unsaddling
the
camels
a
minute
or
two
of
anxious
suspense
then
peering
over
our
beasts
backs
we
saw
their
long
line
filing
off
towards
the
oasis
we
watched
their
turbaned
heads
silhouetted
against
the
sky
disappear
slowly
one
by
one
they
faded
away
the
danger
was
past
with
beating
hearts
we
rose
up
again
the
doctor
sprang
into
his
place
and
seated
himself
on
his
camel
ride
on
sheikh
he
said
all
yer
men
as
if
grim
death
was
afther
ye
camels
or
no
camels
ye
got
to
march
all
night
for
never
draw
rein
till
we
safe
back
at
geergeh
and
sure
enough
we
never
halted
under
the
persuasive
influence
of
that
loaded
revolver
till
we
dismounted
once
more
in
the
early
dawn
upon
the
nile
bank
under
british
protection
then
elsie
and
i
and
our
rescued
broke
down
together
in
an
orgy
of
relief
we
hugged
one
another
and
cried
like
so
many
children
viii
the
adventure
of
the
patrician
away
to
india
a
life
on
the
ocean
wave
once
more
and
may
it
prove
less
wavy
in
plain
prose
my
arrangement
with
proprietor
elworthy
thus
we
speak
in
the
newspaper
trade
included
a
trip
to
bombay
for
myself
and
elsie
so
as
soon
as
we
had
drained
upper
egypt
journalistically
dry
we
returned
to
cairo
on
our
road
to
suez
i
am
glad
to
say
my
letters
to
the
gave
satisfaction
my
employer
wrote
are
a
born
journalist
i
confess
this
surprised
me
for
i
have
always
considered
myself
a
truthful
person
still
as
he
evidently
meant
it
for
praise
i
took
the
doubtful
compliment
in
good
part
and
offered
no
remonstrance
i
have
a
mercurial
temperament
my
spirits
rise
and
fall
as
if
they
were
consols
monotonous
egypt
depressed
me
as
it
depressed
the
israelites
but
the
passage
of
the
red
sea
set
me
sounding
my
timbrel
i
love
fresh
air
i
love
the
sea
if
the
sea
will
but
behave
itself
and
i
positively
revelled
in
the
change
from
egypt
unfortunately
we
had
taken
our
passages
by
a
and
steamer
from
suez
to
bombay
many
weeks
beforehand
so
as
to
secure
good
berths
and
still
more
unfortunately
in
a
letter
to
lady
georgina
i
had
chanced
to
mention
the
name
of
our
ship
and
the
date
of
the
voyage
i
kept
up
a
spasmodic
correspondence
with
lady
georgina
nowadays
a
fortnight
the
dear
cantankerous
racy
old
lady
had
been
the
foundation
of
my
fortunes
and
i
was
genuinely
grateful
to
her
or
rather
i
ought
to
say
she
had
been
their
second
foundress
for
i
will
do
myself
the
justice
to
admit
that
the
first
was
my
own
initiative
and
enterprise
i
flatter
myself
i
have
the
knack
of
taking
the
tide
on
the
turn
and
i
am
justly
proud
of
it
but
being
a
grateful
animal
i
wrote
once
a
fortnight
to
report
progress
to
lady
georgina
besides
let
me
whisper
strictly
between
ourselves
was
an
indirect
way
of
hearing
about
harold
this
time
however
as
events
turned
out
i
recognised
that
i
had
made
a
grave
mistake
in
confiding
my
movements
to
my
shrewd
old
lady
she
did
not
betray
me
on
purpose
of
course
but
i
gathered
later
that
casually
in
conversation
she
must
have
mentioned
the
fact
and
date
of
my
sailing
before
somebody
who
ought
to
have
had
no
concern
in
it
and
the
somebody
i
found
had
governed
himself
accordingly
all
this
however
i
only
discovered
afterwards
so
without
anticipating
i
will
narrate
the
facts
exactly
as
they
occurred
to
me
illustration
an
young
man
when
we
mounted
the
gangway
of
the
at
suez
and
began
the
process
of
frizzling
down
the
red
sea
i
noted
on
deck
almost
at
once
an
young
man
of
or
thereabouts
with
a
curious
faint
complexion
he
was
the
young
man
i
ever
beheld
in
my
life
an
achromatic
study
in
spite
of
the
delicate
of
his
skin
all
the
colouring
matter
of
the
body
seemed
somehow
to
have
faded
out
of
him
perhaps
he
had
been
bleached
as
he
leant
over
the
taffrail
gazing
down
with
open
mouth
and
vacant
stare
at
the
water
i
took
a
good
long
look
at
him
he
interested
me
much
because
he
was
so
exceptionally
uninteresting
a
pallid
anÃ¦mic
indefinite
hobbledehoy
with
a
high
narrow
forehead
and
sketchy
features
he
had
watery
restless
eyes
of
an
insipid
light
blue
thin
yellow
hair
almost
white
in
its
paleness
and
twitching
hands
that
played
nervously
all
the
time
with
a
shadowy
moustache
this
shadowy
moustache
seemed
to
absorb
as
a
rule
the
best
part
of
his
attention
it
was
so
sparse
and
so
blanched
that
he
felt
it
continually
to
assure
himself
no
doubt
of
the
reality
of
its
existence
i
need
hardly
add
that
he
wore
an
he
was
an
aristocrat
i
felt
sure
eton
and
christ
church
no
ordinary
person
could
have
been
quite
so
flavourless
imbecility
like
his
is
only
to
be
attained
as
the
result
of
long
and
judicious
selection
he
went
on
gazing
in
a
vacant
way
at
the
water
below
an
ineffectual
patrician
smile
playing
feebly
round
the
corners
of
his
mouth
meanwhile
then
he
turned
and
stared
at
me
as
i
lay
back
in
my
for
a
minute
he
looked
me
over
as
if
i
were
a
horse
for
sale
when
he
had
finished
inspecting
me
he
beckoned
to
somebody
at
the
far
end
of
the
the
somebody
sidled
up
with
a
deferential
air
which
confirmed
my
belief
in
the
young
man
aristocratic
origin
it
was
such
deference
as
the
british
flunkey
pays
only
to
blue
blood
for
he
has
gradations
of
flunkeydom
he
is
respectful
to
wealth
polite
to
acquired
rank
but
servile
only
to
hereditary
nobility
indeed
you
can
make
a
rough
guess
at
the
social
status
of
the
person
he
addresses
by
observing
which
one
of
his
nicely
graduated
manners
he
adopts
in
addressing
him
the
young
man
glanced
over
in
my
direction
and
murmured
something
to
the
satellite
whose
back
was
turned
towards
me
i
felt
sure
from
his
attitude
he
was
asking
whether
i
was
the
person
he
suspected
me
to
be
the
satellite
nodded
assent
whereat
the
young
man
screwing
up
his
face
to
fix
his
stared
harder
than
ever
he
must
be
heir
to
a
peerage
i
felt
convinced
nobody
short
of
that
rank
would
consider
himself
entitled
to
stare
with
such
frank
unconcern
at
an
unknown
lady
presently
it
further
occurred
to
me
that
the
satellite
back
seemed
strangely
familiar
have
seen
that
man
somewhere
elsie
i
whispered
putting
aside
the
wisps
of
hair
that
blew
about
my
face
have
i
dear
elsie
answered
with
a
slight
shudder
and
i
was
instinctively
aware
that
i
too
disliked
him
as
elsie
spoke
the
man
turned
and
strolled
slowly
past
us
with
that
ineffable
insolence
which
is
the
other
side
of
the
insufferable
he
cast
a
glance
at
us
as
he
went
by
a
withering
glance
of
brazen
effrontery
we
knew
him
now
of
course
it
was
that
variable
star
our
old
acquaintance
higginson
the
courier
he
was
here
as
himself
this
time
no
longer
the
count
or
the
mysterious
the
diplomat
hid
his
rays
under
the
garb
of
the
upon
it
elsie
i
cried
clutching
her
arm
with
a
vague
sense
of
fear
man
means
mischief
there
is
danger
ahead
when
a
creature
of
higginson
sort
who
has
risen
to
be
a
count
and
a
fashionable
physician
descends
again
to
be
a
courier
you
may
rest
assured
it
is
because
he
has
something
to
gain
by
it
he
has
some
deep
scheme
afloat
and
are
part
of
it
master
looks
weak
enough
and
silly
enough
for
anything
elsie
answered
eyeing
the
suspected
lordling
should
think
he
is
just
the
sort
of
man
such
a
wily
rogue
would
naturally
fasten
upon
a
wily
rogue
gets
hold
of
a
weak
fool
who
is
also
dishonest
i
said
two
together
may
make
a
formidable
combination
but
never
mind
we
forewarned
i
think
i
shall
be
even
with
him
that
evening
at
dinner
in
the
saloon
the
young
man
strolled
in
with
a
jaunty
air
and
took
his
seat
next
to
us
the
red
sea
by
the
way
was
kinder
than
the
mediterranean
it
allowed
us
to
dine
from
the
very
first
evening
cards
had
been
laid
on
the
plates
to
mark
our
places
i
glanced
at
my
neighbour
it
bore
the
inscription
southminster
that
was
the
name
of
lord
kynaston
eldest
son
lady
georgina
nephew
harold
tillington
cousin
so
was
the
man
who
might
possibly
inherit
marmaduke
ashurst
money
i
remembered
now
how
often
and
how
fervently
lady
georgina
had
said
sons
are
all
fools
if
the
rest
came
up
to
sample
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
her
it
also
flashed
across
me
that
lord
southminster
might
have
heard
through
higginson
of
our
meeting
with
marmaduke
ashurst
at
florence
and
of
my
acquaintance
with
harold
tillington
at
schlangenbad
and
lungern
with
a
woman
instinct
i
jumped
at
the
fact
that
the
young
man
had
taken
passage
by
this
boat
on
purpose
to
baffle
both
me
and
harold
thinking
it
over
it
seemed
to
me
too
that
he
might
have
various
possible
points
of
view
on
the
matter
he
might
desire
for
example
that
harold
should
marry
me
under
the
impression
that
his
marriage
with
a
penniless
outsider
would
annoy
his
uncle
for
the
young
man
doubtless
thought
that
i
was
still
to
ashurst
just
that
dreadful
adventuress
if
so
his
obvious
cue
would
be
to
promote
a
good
understanding
between
harold
and
myself
in
order
to
make
us
marry
so
that
the
urbane
old
gentlemen
might
then
disinherit
his
favourite
nephew
and
make
a
new
will
in
lord
southminster
interest
or
again
the
young
man
might
on
the
contrary
be
aware
that
ashurst
and
i
had
got
on
admirably
together
when
we
met
at
florence
in
which
case
his
aim
would
naturally
be
to
find
out
something
that
might
set
the
rich
uncle
against
me
yet
once
more
he
might
merely
have
heard
that
i
had
drawn
up
uncle
marmaduke
will
at
the
office
and
he
might
desire
to
worm
the
contents
of
it
out
of
me
whichever
was
his
design
i
resolved
to
be
upon
my
guard
in
every
word
i
said
to
him
and
leave
no
door
open
to
any
trickery
either
way
for
of
one
thing
i
felt
sure
that
the
colourless
young
man
had
torn
himself
away
from
the
of
piccadilly
for
this
voyage
to
india
only
because
he
had
heard
there
was
a
chance
of
meeting
me
that
was
a
politic
move
whoever
planned
it
himself
or
higginson
for
a
week
on
board
ship
with
a
person
or
persons
is
the
very
best
chance
of
getting
thrown
in
with
them
whether
they
like
it
or
lump
it
they
easily
avoid
you
it
was
while
i
was
pondering
these
things
in
my
mind
and
resolving
with
myself
not
to
give
myself
away
that
the
young
man
with
the
face
lounged
in
and
dropped
into
the
next
seat
to
me
he
was
dressed
amongst
other
things
in
a
dinner
jacket
and
a
white
tie
for
myself
i
detest
such
fopperies
on
board
ship
they
seem
to
me
out
of
place
they
conflict
with
the
infinite
possibilities
of
the
situation
one
stands
too
near
the
realities
of
things
evening
dress
and
sort
ill
together
illustration
he
turned
to
me
with
an
inane
smile
as
my
neighbour
sat
down
he
turned
to
me
with
an
inane
smile
which
occupied
all
his
face
evening
he
said
in
a
baronial
drawl
cayley
i
gathah
i
asked
the
skippah
leave
to
set
next
yah
we
ought
to
be
friends
rathah
i
think
yah
know
my
poor
deah
old
aunt
lady
georgina
fawley
i
bowed
a
somewhat
freezing
bow
georgina
is
one
of
my
dearest
friends
i
answered
really
poor
deah
old
georgey
got
somebody
to
stick
up
for
her
at
last
has
she
now
that
what
i
call
chivalrous
of
yah
magnanimous
is
it
i
like
to
see
people
stick
up
for
their
friends
and
it
must
be
a
novelty
for
georgey
for
between
you
and
me
a
moah
cantankerous
spiteful
acidulated
old
than
the
poor
deah
soul
it
be
difficult
to
hit
upon
georgina
has
brains
i
answered
they
enable
her
to
recognise
a
fool
when
she
sees
him
i
will
admit
that
she
does
not
suffer
fools
gladly
he
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
sharp
look
in
the
depths
of
the
eyes
already
it
began
to
strike
me
that
though
the
young
man
was
inane
he
had
his
due
proportion
of
a
certain
insidious
practical
cunning
true
he
answered
measuring
me
according
to
her
almost
everybody
a
fool
especially
her
relations
there
a
fine
knack
of
sweeping
generalisation
about
deah
skinny
old
georgey
the
few
people
she
reahlly
likes
are
all
archangels
the
rest
are
blithering
idiots
there
no
middle
course
with
her
i
held
my
peace
frigidly
thinks
me
a
very
special
and
peculiah
fool
he
went
on
crumbling
his
bread
georgina
i
answered
a
person
of
exceptional
discrimination
i
would
almost
always
accept
her
judgment
on
anyone
as
practically
final
he
laid
down
his
fondled
the
imperceptible
moustache
with
his
tapering
fingers
and
then
broke
once
more
into
a
cheerful
expanse
of
smile
which
reminded
me
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
the
village
idiot
it
spread
over
his
face
as
the
splash
from
a
stone
spreads
over
a
that
a
nice
cheerful
sort
of
thing
to
say
to
a
fellah
he
ejaculated
fixing
his
in
his
eye
with
a
few
fierce
contortions
of
his
facial
muscles
encouraging
do
yah
know
as
the
foundation
of
an
acquaintance

a
good
calculated
to
place
things
at
once
upon
what
yah
call
a
friendly
basis
georgey
said
you
had
a
pretty
wit
i
see
now
why
she
admiahed
it
birds
of
a
feathah
very
wise
old
proverb
i
reflected
that
after
all
this
young
man
had
nothing
overt
against
him
beyond
a
fishy
blue
eye
and
an
inane
expression
so
feeling
that
i
had
perhaps
gone
a
little
too
far
i
continued
after
a
minute
your
uncle
how
is
he
he
inquired
with
another
elephantine
smile
and
then
i
perceived
it
was
a
form
of
humour
with
him
or
rather
a
cheap
substitute
to
speak
of
his
elder
relations
by
their
abbreviated
christian
names
without
any
prefix
doing
very
well
thank
yah
as
well
as
could
be
expected
in
fact
bettah
habakkuk
on
the
brain
it
carrying
him
off
at
last
he
has
bright
disease
very
bad
drank
port
do
yah
know
and
wo
trouble
this
wicked
world
much
longah
with
his
presence
it
will
be
a
happy
release
especially
for
his
nephews
i
was
really
grieved
for
i
had
grown
to
like
the
urbane
old
gentleman
as
i
had
grown
to
like
the
cantankerous
old
lady
in
spite
of
his
fussiness
and
his
stock
exchange
views
on
the
interpretation
of
scripture
his
genuine
kindliness
and
his
real
liking
for
me
had
softened
my
heart
to
him
and
my
face
must
have
shown
my
distress
for
the
young
man
added
quickly
with
an
afterthought
need
be
afraid
yah
know
it
all
right
for
harold
tillington
you
ought
to
know
that
as
well
as
anyone
and
bettah
for
it
was
you
who
drew
up
his
will
for
him
at
florence
i
flushed
crimson
i
believe
then
he
knew
all
about
me
was
not
asking
on
tillington
account
i
answered
asked
because
i
have
a
personal
feeling
of
friendship
for
your
uncle
mr
ashurst
his
hand
strayed
up
to
the
straggling
yellow
hairs
on
his
upper
lip
once
more
and
he
smiled
again
this
time
with
a
curious
undercurrent
of
foolish
craftiness
a
good
one
he
answered
told
me
you
were
original
marmy
a
millionaire
and
many
people
love
millionaires
for
their
money
but
to
love
marmy
for
himself
i
do
call
that
originality
why
weight
for
age
he
acknowledged
to
be
the
most
portentous
old
boah
in
london
society
like
ashurst
because
he
has
a
kind
heart
and
some
genuine
instincts
i
answered
has
not
allowed
all
human
feeling
to
be
replaced
by
a
cheap
mask
of
pall
mall
cynicism
i
say
how
that
for
preaching
do
you
manage
to
give
it
hot
to
a
fellah
neithah
and
at
sight
too
without
the
usual
three
days
of
grace
have
some
of
my
champagne
i
a
forgiving
creachah
thank
you
i
prefer
this
hock
friend
then
and
he
motioned
the
steward
to
pass
the
bottle
to
my
great
disgust
elsie
held
out
her
glass
i
was
annoyed
at
that
it
showed
she
had
missed
the
drift
of
our
conversation
and
was
therefore
lacking
in
feminine
intuition
i
should
be
sorry
if
i
had
allowed
the
higher
mathematics
to
kill
out
in
me
the
most
distinctively
womanly
faculty
from
that
first
day
forth
however
in
spite
of
this
beginning
lord
southminster
almost
persecuted
me
with
his
persistent
attentions
he
did
all
a
fellah
could
possibly
do
to
please
me
i
could
not
make
out
precisely
what
he
was
driving
at
but
i
saw
he
had
some
artful
game
of
his
own
to
play
and
that
he
was
playing
it
subtly
i
also
saw
that
vapid
as
he
was
his
vapidity
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
worldly
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
the
man
of
the
world
who
utterly
distrusts
and
disbelieves
in
all
the
higher
emotions
of
humanity
he
harped
so
often
on
this
string
that
on
our
second
day
out
as
we
lolled
on
deck
in
the
heat
i
had
to
rebuke
him
sharply
he
had
been
sneering
for
some
hours
are
two
kinds
of
silly
simplicity
lord
southminster
i
said
at
last
kind
is
the
silly
simplicity
of
the
rustic
who
trusts
everybody
the
other
kind
is
the
silly
simplicity
of
the
pall
mall
clubman
who
trusts
nobody
it
is
just
as
foolish
and
just
as
to
overlook
the
good
as
to
overlook
the
evil
in
humanity
if
you
trust
everyone
you
are
likely
to
be
taken
in
but
if
you
trust
no
one
you
put
yourself
at
a
serious
practical
disadvantage
besides
losing
half
the
joy
of
living
you
think
me
a
fool
like
georgey
he
broke
out
should
never
be
rude
enough
to
say
so
i
answered
fanning
myself
you
what
i
call
a
companion
for
a
voyage
down
the
red
sea
he
put
in
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
awnings
a
lovely
freezing
mixture
a
fellah
does
need
ices
when
on
tap
i
recommend
you
as
a
refrigeratah
am
glad
i
answered
demurely
i
have
secured
your
approbation
in
that
humble
capacity
i
sure
i
have
tried
hard
for
it
illustration
nothing
seemed
to
put
the
man
down
yet
nothing
that
i
could
say
seemed
to
put
the
man
down
in
spite
of
rebuffs
he
was
assiduous
in
running
down
the
for
my
parasol
or
my
he
fetched
me
chairs
he
stayed
me
with
cushions
he
offered
to
lend
me
books
he
pestered
me
to
drink
his
wine
and
he
kept
elsie
in
champagne
which
she
annoyed
me
by
accepting
poor
dear
elsie
clearly
failed
to
understand
the
creature
so
kind
and
polite
brownie
is
he
she
would
observe
in
her
simple
fashion
you
know
i
think
he
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
you
and
he
be
an
earl
i
call
it
romantic
how
lovely
it
would
seem
dear
to
see
you
a
countess
i
said
severely
with
one
hand
on
her
arm
are
a
dear
little
soul
and
i
am
very
fond
of
you
but
if
you
think
i
could
sell
myself
for
a
coronet
to
a
young
man
with
a
complexion
and
glassy
blue
eyes
i
can
only
say
my
child
you
have
misread
my
character
he
is
a
man
he
a
lump
of
putty
i
think
elsie
was
quite
shocked
that
i
should
apply
these
terms
to
a
courtesy
lord
the
eldest
son
of
a
peer
nature
had
endowed
her
with
the
profound
british
belief
that
peers
should
be
spoken
of
in
choice
and
peculiar
language
a
peer
a
fool
lady
georgina
said
once
to
me
think
you
should
say
his
temperament
does
not
fit
him
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
if
he
a
rouÃ©
or
a
drunkard
they
think
you
should
say
he
has
unfortunate
weaknesses
what
most
of
all
convinced
me
however
that
the
young
man
with
the
complexion
must
be
playing
some
stealthy
game
was
the
demeanour
and
mental
attitude
of
higginson
his
courier
after
the
first
day
higginson
appeared
to
be
politeness
and
deference
itself
to
us
he
behaved
to
us
both
as
if
we
belonged
to
the
titled
classes
he
treated
us
with
the
second
best
of
his
graduated
manners
he
fetched
and
carried
for
us
with
a
courtly
grace
which
recalled
that
distinguished
diplomat
the
comte
de
at
the
station
at
malines
with
lady
georgina
it
is
true
at
his
politest
moments
i
often
caught
the
undercurrent
of
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
felt
sure
he
was
doing
it
all
with
some
profound
motive
but
his
external
demeanour
was
everything
that
one
could
desire
from
a
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
the
same
man
who
had
growled
to
me
at
florence
shall
be
even
with
you
yet
as
he
left
our
office
you
know
brownie
elsie
mused
once
really
begin
to
think
we
must
have
misjudged
higginson
he
so
extremely
polite
perhaps
after
all
he
is
really
a
count
who
has
been
exiled
and
impoverished
for
his
political
opinions
i
smiled
and
held
my
tongue
silence
costs
nothing
but
political
opinions
i
felt
sure
were
of
that
simple
communistic
sort
which
the
law
in
its
blunt
way
calls
fraudulent
they
consisted
in
a
belief
that
all
was
his
which
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
a
splendid
fellah
for
his
place
yah
know
miss
cayley
lord
southminster
said
to
me
one
evening
as
we
were
approaching
aden
i
like
about
him
is
he
so
doosid
intelligent
so
i
answered
then
the
devil
entered
into
me
again
had
the
doosid
intelligence
even
to
take
in
lady
georgina
that
just
it
do
you
know
georgey
told
me
that
story
screamingly
funny
was
it
and
i
said
to
myself
at
once
the
man
for
me
i
want
a
courier
with
jolly
lots
of
brains
and
no
blooming
scruples
i
entice
this
chap
away
from
marmy
and
i
did
i
outbid
marmy
oh
yaas
he
a
fellah
higginson
what
want
is
a
man
who
will
do
what
he
told
and
ask
no
beastly
unpleasant
questions
higginson
that
man
he
as
sharp
as
a
ferret
as
dishonest
as
they
make
them
he
opened
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
unconcern
the
bettah
for
my
purpose
see
how
frank
i
am
miss
cayley
i
tell
the
truth
the
truth
is
very
rare
you
ought
to
respect
me
for
it
depends
somewhat
upon
the
of
truth
i
answered
with
a
random
shot
do
respect
a
man
for
instance
for
confessing
to
a
forgery
he
winced
not
for
months
after
did
i
know
how
a
stone
thrown
at
a
venture
had
chanced
to
hit
the
spot
and
had
vastly
enhanced
his
opinion
of
my
cleverness
have
heard
about
too
i
suppose
i
went
on
yaas
was
it
real
jam
he
did
the
on
a
lady
in
switzerland
and
the
way
he
has
come
it
ovah
deah
simple
old
marmy
he
played
marmy
with
ezekiel
not
so
dusty
was
it
he
too
lovely
for
anything
an
edged
tool
i
said
that
why
i
use
him
edged
tools
may
cut
the
user
fingers
illustration
yah
do
catch
me
going
so
fah
from
newmarket
mine
he
answered
taking
out
a
cigarette
deah
no
he
turn
against
he
would
dare
to
yah
see
i
have
the
fellah
entirely
in
my
powah
i
know
all
his
little
games
and
i
can
expose
him
any
day
but
it
suits
me
to
keep
him
i
do
mind
telling
yah
since
i
respect
your
intellect
that
he
and
i
are
engaged
in
pulling
off
a
big
togethah
if
it
were
not
for
that
i
would
be
heah
yah
catch
me
going
away
so
fah
from
newmarket
and
the
empire
for
nothing
judged
as
much
i
answered
and
then
i
was
silent
but
i
wondered
to
myself
why
the
young
man
should
be
so
communicative
to
an
obviously
hostile
stranger
for
the
next
few
days
it
amused
me
to
see
how
hard
our
lordling
tried
to
suit
his
conversation
to
myself
and
elsie
he
was
absurdly
anxious
to
humour
us
just
at
first
it
is
true
he
had
discussed
the
subjects
that
lay
nearest
to
his
own
heart
he
was
an
ardent
votary
of
the
noble
quadruped
and
he
loved
the
turf
whose
sward
we
judged
he
trod
mainly
at
tattersall
he
spoke
to
us
with
erudition
on
form
and
gave
us
several
things
for
the
spring
handicaps
the
oaks
he
considered
moral
for
clorinda
he
also
retailed
certain
choice
anecdotes
about
ladies
whose
christian
names
were
chiefly
tottie
and
flo
and
whose
honoured
surnames
have
escaped
my
memory
most
of
them
flourished
i
recollect
at
the
frivolity
music
hall
but
when
he
learned
that
our
interest
in
the
noble
quadruped
was
scarcely
more
than
tepid
and
that
we
had
never
even
visited
as
he
affectionately
called
it
he
did
his
best
in
turn
to
acquire
our
subjects
he
had
heard
us
talk
about
florence
for
example
and
he
gathered
from
our
talk
that
we
loved
its
art
treasures
so
he
set
himself
to
work
to
be
studiously
artistic
it
was
a
beautiful
study
in
human
ineptitude
yaas
he
murmured
turning
up
the
pale
blue
eyes
ecstatically
towards
the
place
florence
i
dote
on
the
pickchahs
i
know
them
all
by
heart
i
assuah
yah
spent
houahs
and
houahs
feeding
my
soul
in
the
galleries
what
particular
painter
does
your
soul
most
feed
upon
i
asked
bluntly
with
a
smile
the
question
staggered
him
i
could
see
him
hunting
through
the
vacant
chambers
of
his
brain
for
a
florentine
painter
then
a
faint
light
gleamed
in
the
leaden
eyes
and
he
fingered
the
moustache
with
that
nervous
hand
till
he
almost
put
a
visible
point
upon
it
raphael
he
said
tentatively
with
an
inquiring
air
yet
beaming
at
his
success
you
think
so
splendid
artist
raphael
a
very
safe
guess
i
answered
leading
him
on
ca
go
far
wrong
in
mentioning
raphael
can
you
but
after
him
he
dived
into
the
recesses
of
his
memory
again
peered
about
him
for
a
minute
or
two
and
brought
back
nothing
ca
remembah
the
othah
fellahs
names
he
went
on
all
so
much
alike
all
in
do
yah
know
but
i
recollect
at
the
time
they
impressed
me
awfully
doubt
i
answered
he
tried
to
look
through
me
and
failed
then
he
plunged
like
a
noble
sportsman
that
he
was
on
a
second
fetch
of
memory
and
michael
angelo
he
went
on
quite
proud
of
his
things
michael
angelo
sweet
i
admitted
simple
so
touching
so
tender
so
domestic
i
thought
elsie
would
explode
but
she
kept
her
countenance
the
young
man
gazed
at
me
uneasily
he
had
half
an
idea
by
this
time
that
i
was
making
game
of
him
however
he
fished
up
a
name
once
more
and
clutched
at
it
too
he
adventured
adore
savonarola
his
pickchahs
are
beautiful
so
rare
elsie
murmured
there
is
fra
diavolo
i
suggested
going
one
better
do
you
like
fra
diavolo
he
seemed
to
have
heard
the
name
before
but
still
he
hesitated
what
did
he
paint
he
asked
with
growing
caution
i
stuffed
him
valiantly
charming
angels
you
know
i
answered
the
roses
and
the
glories
yaas
i
recollect
all
askew
are
they
like
this
i
remembah
them
very
well
but
a
doubt
flitted
across
his
brain
his
name
fra
angelico
brother
i
replied
casting
truth
to
the
winds
worked
together
you
must
have
heard
one
did
the
saints
the
other
did
the
opposite
division
of
labour
do
you
see
fra

fra

was
fra

also
a
composah
he
fingered
his
cigarette
with
a
dubious
hand
and
wriggled
his
tighter
beautiful

but
growing
suspicious
apace
fra

also
a

course
i
assented
his
off
time
he
composed
those
early
italians
so
versatile
you
see
so
versatile
he
had
his
doubts
but
he
suppressed
them
torricelli
i
went
on
with
a
side
glance
at
elsie
who
was
choking
by
this
time
chianti
and
frittura
and
cinquevalli
and
giulio

his
distrust
increased

trying
to
make
me
commit

out

used
to

gaiety
theatre
i
continued
in
a
drawl
like
his
own
are
risotto
and
gnocchi
and
vermicelli
and
anchovy
all
famous
paintahs
and
all
of
whom
i
do
doubt
you
admiah
elsie
exploded
at
last
but
he
took
no
offence
he
smiled
inanely
as
if
he
rather
enjoyed
it
heah
you
know
he
said
with
his
crafty
smile
one
too
much
i
not
taking
any
you
think
yourselves
very
clevah
for
kidding
me
with
paintahs
who
are
really
macaroni
and
cheese
and
claret
yet
if
i
were
to
tell
you
the
lejah
was
run
at
ascot
or
the
cesarewitch
at
doncastah
why
you
be
no
wisah
when
it
comes
to
art
i
do
have
a
look
in
but
i
could
tell
you
a
thing
or
two
about
starting
prices
and
i
was
forced
to
admit
that
there
he
had
reason
still
i
think
he
realised
that
he
had
better
avoid
the
subject
of
art
in
future
as
we
avoided
the
noble
quadruped
he
saw
his
limitations
not
till
the
last
evening
before
we
reached
bombay
did
i
really
understand
the
nature
of
my
neighbour
project
that
evening
as
it
chanced
elsie
had
a
headache
and
went
below
early
i
stopped
with
her
till
she
dozed
off
then
i
slipped
up
on
deck
once
more
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
before
retiring
for
the
night
to
the
hot
and
stuffy
cabin
it
was
an
exquisite
evening
the
moon
rode
in
the
pale
green
sky
of
the
tropics
a
strange
light
still
lingered
on
the
western
horizon
the
stifling
heat
of
the
red
sea
had
given
way
long
since
to
the
refreshing
coolness
of
the
indian
ocean
i
strolled
a
while
on
the
and
sat
down
at
last
near
the
stern
next
moment
i
was
aware
of
somebody
creeping
up
to
me
heah
miss
cayley
a
voice
broke
in
in
luck
at
last
been
waiting
oh
evah
so
long
for
this
opportunity
i
turned
and
faced
him
you
indeed
i
answered
i
have
lord
southminster
i
tried
to
rise
but
he
motioned
me
back
to
my
chair
there
were
ladies
on
deck
and
to
avoid
being
noticed
i
sank
into
my
seat
again
want
to
speak
to
you
he
went
on
in
a
voice
that
for
him
was
almost
impressive
a
mo
miss
cayley
i
want
to
say
this
last
night
you
misunderstand
me
the
contrary
i
answered
trouble
is
that
i
understand
you
perfectly
yah
do
look
heah
he
bent
forward
quite
romantically
going
to
be
perfectly
frank
of
course
yah
know
that
when
i
came
on
board
this
ship
i
came
to
checkmate
yah
course
i
replied
else
should
you
and
higginson
have
bothered
to
come
here
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
just
it
you
always
clevah
you
hit
it
first
shot
but
there
wheah
the
point
comes
in
at
first
i
only
thought
of
how
we
could
circumvent
yah
i
treated
yah
as
the
enemy
now
it
all
the
othah
way
miss
cayley
you
the
cleverest
woman
i
evah
met
in
this
world
you
extort
my
admiration
i
could
not
repress
a
smile
i
did
know
how
it
was
but
i
could
see
i
possessed
some
mysterious
attraction
for
the
ashurst
family
i
was
fatal
to
ashursts
lady
georgina
harold
tillington
the
honourable
marmaduke
lord
southminster
different
types
as
they
were
all
succumbed
without
one
blow
to
me
flatter
me
i
answered
coldly
i
do
he
cried
flashing
his
cuffs
and
gazing
affectionately
at
his
my
soul
i
assuah
yah
i
mean
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
i
admiah
yah
i
admiah
your
intellect
every
day
i
have
seen
yah
i
feel
it
moah
and
moah
why
you
the
only
person
who
has
evah
my
fellah
higginson
as
a
rule
i
do
think
much
of
women
i
been
through
several
london
seasons
and
lots
of
have
tried
their
level
best
to
catch
me
the
cleverest
mammas
have
been
aftah
me
for
their
ethels
but
i
was
so
easily
caught
i
dodged
the
ethels
with
you
it
different
i
feel
he
paused
a
woman
a
fellah
might
be
really
proud
of
are
too
kind
i
answered
in
my
refrigerator
voice
will
you
take
me
he
asked
trying
to
seize
my
hand
cayley
if
you
will
you
will
make
me
unspeakably
happy
it
was
a
great
effort
for
him
and
i
was
sorry
to
crush
it
regret
i
said
i
am
compelled
to
deny
you
unspeakable
happiness
illustration
take
my
word
for
it
you
staking
your
money
on
the
wrong
fellah
but
you
do
catch
on
you
mistake
let
me
explain
you
backing
the
othah
man
now
i
happen
to
know
about
that
and
i
assuah
you
an
error
take
my
word
for
it
you
staking
your
money
on
the
wrong
fellah
do
not
understand
you
i
replied
drawing
away
from
his
approach
what
is
more
i
may
add
you
could
never
understand
me
but
i
do
i
understand
perfectly
i
can
see
where
you
go
wrong
you
drew
up
marmy
will
and
you
think
marmy
has
left
all
he
worth
to
harold
tillington
so
you
putting
every
penny
you
got
on
harold
well
that
mere
moonshine
harold
may
think
it
all
right
but
not
all
right
there
many
a
slip
the
cup
and
the
probate
court
listen
heah
miss
cayley
higginson
and
i
are
a
jolly
sight
sharpah
than
your
friend
harold
harold
what
they
call
a
clevah
fellah
in
society
and
i
what
they
call
a
fool
but
i
know
bettah
than
harold
which
side
of
my
bread
buttahed
do
doubt
it
i
answered
i
have
managed
this
business
i
do
mind
telling
you
now
i
had
a
telegram
from
marmy
valet
when
we
touched
at
aden
and
poor
old
marmy
sinking
habakkuk
been
too
much
for
him
sixteen
stone
going
under
why
am
i
not
with
him
yah
may
ask
because
when
a
man
of
marmy
temperament
is
dying
it
safah
to
be
away
from
him
plenty
of
time
for
marmy
to
altah
his
will
yet
and
there
are
othah
contingencies
still
harold
quite
out
of
it
you
take
my
word
for
it
if
you
back
harold
you
back
a
man
who
not
going
to
get
anything
while
if
you
back
me
you
back
the
winnah
with
a
coronet
into
the
bargain
and
he
smiled
fatuously
i
looked
at
him
with
a
look
that
would
have
made
a
wiser
man
wince
but
it
fell
flat
on
lord
southminster
you
know
why
i
do
not
rise
and
go
down
to
my
cabin
at
once
i
said
slowly
if
i
did
somebody
as
i
passed
might
see
my
burning
cheeks
cheeks
flushed
with
shame
at
your
insulting
proposal
and
might
guess
that
you
had
asked
me
and
that
i
had
refused
you
and
i
should
shrink
from
the
disgrace
of
knowing
that
you
had
put
such
a
humiliation
upon
me
you
have
been
frank
with
me
after
your
kind
lord
southminster
frank
with
the
frankness
of
a
low
and
purely
commercial
nature
i
will
be
frank
with
you
in
turn
you
are
right
in
supposing
that
i
love
harold
tillington
a
man
whose
name
i
hate
to
mention
in
your
presence
but
you
are
wrong
in
supposing
that
the
disposition
of
marmaduke
ashurst
money
has
or
can
have
anything
to
do
with
the
feelings
i
entertain
towards
him
i
would
marry
him
all
the
sooner
if
he
were
poor
and
penniless
you
can
not
that
state
of
mind
of
course
but
you
must
be
content
to
it
and
i
would
not
marry
if
there
were
no
other
man
left
in
the
world
to
marry
i
should
as
soon
think
of
marrying
a
lump
of
dough
i
faced
him
all
crimson
plain
enough
do
you
see
now
that
i
really
mean
it
he
gazed
at
me
with
a
curious
look
and
twirled
what
he
considered
his
moustache
once
more
quite
airily
the
man
was
imperturbable
a
pachydermatous
imbecile
all
wrong
yah
know
he
said
after
a
long
pause
during
which
he
had
regarded
me
through
his
as
if
i
were
a
specimen
of
some
rare
new
species
all
wrong
and
yah
wo
believe
me
but
i
tell
yah
i
know
what
i
talking
about
you
think
it
quite
safe
about
marmy
money
that
he
left
it
to
harold
because
you
drew
the
will
up
i
assuah
you
that
will
not
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
you
fancy
harold
a
hot
favourite
he
a
rank
outsidah
i
give
you
a
chance
and
you
wo
take
it
i
want
yah
because
you
a
remarkable
woman
most
of
the
ethels
cry
when
trying
to
make
a
fellah
propose
to
and
i
do
like
damp
but
have
some
go
about
yah
you
insist
upon
backing
the
wrong
man
but
you
find
your
mistake
out
yet
a
bright
idea
struck
him
say
why
do
you
hedge
leave
it
open
till
marmy
gone
and
then
marry
the
winnah
it
was
hopeless
trying
to
make
this
clod
understand
his
brain
was
not
built
with
the
right
cells
for
understanding
me
southminster
i
said
turning
upon
him
and
clasping
my
hands
will
not
go
away
while
you
stop
here
but
you
have
some
spark
enough
of
a
gentleman
in
your
composition
i
hope
not
to
inflict
your
company
any
longer
upon
a
woman
who
does
not
desire
it
i
ask
you
to
leave
me
here
alone
when
you
have
gone
and
i
have
had
time
to
recover
from
your
degrading
offer
i
may
perhaps
feel
able
to
go
down
to
my
cabin
he
stared
at
me
with
open
blue
eyes
those
watery
blue
eyes
just
as
you
like
he
answered
wanted
to
do
you
a
good
turn
because
you
the
only
woman
i
evah
really
admiahed
to
say
admiah
do
you
know
not
trotted
round
like
the
ethels
but
you
wo
allow
me
i
go
if
you
wish
it
though
i
tell
you
again
you
backing
the
wrong
man
and
soonah
or
latah
you
discover
it
i
do
mind
laying
you
six
to
four
against
him
howevah
i
do
one
thing
for
yah
i
leave
this
offah
always
open
i
not
likely
to
marry
any
othah
woman
not
good
enough
is
it
and
if
evah
you
find
out
you
mistaken
about
harold
tillington
remembah
honour
bright
i
shall
be
ready
at
any
time
to
renew
my
offah
by
this
time
i
was
at
i
could
not
find
words
to
answer
him
i
waved
him
away
angrily
with
one
hand
he
raised
his
hat
with
quite
a
jaunty
air
and
strolled
off
forward
puffing
his
cigarette
i
do
think
he
even
knew
the
disgust
with
which
he
inspired
me
i
sat
some
hours
with
the
cool
air
playing
about
my
burning
cheeks
before
i
mustered
up
courage
to
rise
and
go
down
below
again
ix
the
adventures
of
the
magnificent
maharajah
our
arrival
at
bombay
was
a
triumphal
entry
we
were
received
like
royalty
indeed
to
tell
you
the
truth
elsie
and
i
were
beginning
to
get
just
a
leetle
bit
spoiled
it
struck
us
now
that
our
casual
connection
with
the
ashurst
family
in
its
various
branches
had
succeeded
in
saddling
us
like
the
lady
of
burleigh
the
burden
of
an
honour
unto
which
we
were
not
born
we
were
everywhere
treated
as
persons
of
importance
and
oh
dear
by
dint
of
such
treatment
we
began
to
feel
at
last
almost
as
if
we
had
been
raised
in
the
purple
i
felt
that
when
we
got
back
to
england
we
should
turn
up
our
noses
at
plain
bread
and
butter
yes
life
has
been
kind
to
me
have
your
researches
into
english
literature
ever
chanced
to
lead
you
into
reading
horace
walpole
i
wonder
that
polite
trifler
is
fond
of
a
word
which
he
coined
himself
it
derives
from
the
name
of
a
certain
happy
indian
prince
serendip
whom
he
unearthed
or
invented
in
some
obscure
oriental
story
a
prince
for
whom
the
fairies
or
the
genii
always
managed
to
make
everything
pleasant
it
implies
the
faculty
which
a
few
of
us
possess
of
finding
whatever
we
want
turn
up
accidentally
at
the
exact
right
moment
well
i
believe
i
must
have
been
born
with
serendipity
in
my
mouth
in
place
of
the
proverbial
silver
spoon
for
wherever
i
go
all
things
seem
to
come
out
exactly
right
for
me
the
for
example
had
hardly
heaved
to
in
bombay
harbour
when
we
noticed
on
the
quay
a
very
oriental
potentate
in
a
large
white
turban
with
a
particularly
big
diamond
stuck
ostentatiously
in
its
front
he
stalked
on
board
with
a
martial
air
as
soon
as
we
stopped
and
made
inquiries
from
our
captain
after
someone
he
expected
the
captain
received
him
with
that
odd
mixture
of
respect
for
rank
and
wealth
combined
with
true
british
contempt
for
the
inferior
black
man
which
is
universal
among
his
class
in
their
dealings
with
native
indian
nobility
the
oriental
potentate
however
who
was
accompanied
by
a
gorgeous
suite
like
that
of
the
wise
men
in
italian
pictures
seemed
satisfied
with
his
information
and
moved
over
with
his
stately
glide
in
our
direction
elsie
and
i
were
standing
near
the
gangway
among
our
rugs
and
bundles
in
the
hopeless
helplessness
of
disembarkation
he
approached
us
respectfully
and
bowing
with
extended
hands
and
a
deferential
air
asked
in
excellent
english
i
venture
to
inquire
which
of
you
two
ladies
is
miss
lois
cayley
am
i
replied
my
breath
taken
away
by
this
unexpected
greeting
i
venture
to
inquire
in
return
how
you
came
to
know
i
was
arriving
by
this
steamer
illustration
i
am
the
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
he
held
out
his
hand
with
a
courteous
inclination
am
the
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
he
answered
in
an
impressive
tone
as
if
everybody
knew
of
the
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
as
familiarly
as
they
knew
of
the
duke
of
cambridge
in
rajputana
the
one
in
the
doab
you
must
have
heard
my
name
from
harold
tillington
i
had
not
but
i
dissembled
so
as
to
salve
his
pride
friends
are
friends
i
answered
sententiously
tillington
friends
are
friends
the
maharajah
retorted
with
a
low
bow
to
elsie
is
no
doubt
miss
petheridge
i
have
heard
of
your
expected
arrival
as
you
will
guess
from
tillington
he
and
i
were
at
oxford
together
i
am
a
merton
man
it
was
tillington
who
first
taught
me
all
i
know
of
cricket
he
took
me
to
stop
at
his
father
place
in
dumfriesshire
i
owe
much
to
his
friendship
and
when
he
wrote
me
that
friends
of
his
were
arriving
by
the
why
i
made
haste
to
run
down
to
bombay
to
greet
them
the
episode
was
one
of
those
mixtures
of
all
places
and
ages
which
only
this
jumbled
century
of
ours
has
witnessed
it
impressed
me
deeply
here
was
this
indian
prince
a
feudal
rajput
chief
living
practically
among
his
vassals
in
the
middle
ages
when
at
home
in
india
yet
he
said
am
a
merton
man
as
harold
himself
might
have
said
it
and
he
talked
about
cricket
as
naturally
as
lord
southminster
talked
about
the
noble
quadruped
the
oddest
part
of
it
all
was
we
alone
felt
the
incongruity
to
the
maharajah
the
change
from
moozuffernuggar
to
oxford
and
from
oxford
back
again
to
moozuffernuggar
seemed
perfectly
natural
they
were
but
two
alternative
phases
in
a
modern
indian
gentleman
education
and
experience
still
what
were
we
to
do
with
him
if
harold
had
presented
me
with
a
white
elephant
i
could
hardly
have
been
more
embarrassed
than
i
was
at
the
apparition
of
this
urbane
and
magnificent
hindoo
prince
he
was
young
he
was
handsome
he
was
slim
for
a
rajah
he
wore
european
costume
save
for
the
huge
white
turban
with
its
obtrusive
diamond
and
he
spoke
english
much
better
than
a
great
many
englishmen
yet
what
place
could
he
fill
in
my
life
and
elsie
for
once
i
felt
almost
angry
with
harold
why
could
he
have
allowed
us
to
go
quietly
through
india
two
simple
unofficial
journalistic
pilgrims
in
our
native
obscurity
his
highness
of
moozuffernuggar
however
had
his
own
views
on
this
question
with
a
courteous
wave
of
one
dusky
hand
he
motioned
us
gracefully
into
somebody
else
deck
chairs
and
then
sat
down
on
another
beside
us
while
the
gorgeous
suite
stood
by
in
respectful
silence
unctuous
gentlemen
in
brocade
forming
a
court
all
round
us
elsie
and
i
unaccustomed
to
be
so
observed
grew
conscious
of
our
hands
our
skirts
our
postures
but
the
maharajah
posed
himself
with
perfect
unconcern
like
one
well
used
to
the
fierce
light
of
royalty
have
come
he
said
with
simple
dignity
superintend
the
preparations
for
your
reception
heavens
i
exclaimed
reception
maharajah
i
think
you
misunderstand
we
are
two
ordinary
english
ladies
of
the
proletariat
accustomed
to
the
level
plain
of
professional
society
we
expect
no
reception
he
bowed
again
with
stately
eastern
deference
of
tillington
he
said
shortly
persons
of
distinction
besides
i
have
heard
of
you
from
lady
georgina
fawley
georgina
is
too
good
i
answered
though
inwardly
i
raged
against
her
why
could
she
leave
us
alone
to
feed
in
peace
on
chicken
instead
of
sending
this
heathen
to
bother
us
i
have
come
down
to
bombay
to
make
sure
that
you
are
met
in
the
style
that
befits
your
importance
in
society
he
went
on
waving
his
suite
away
with
one
careless
hand
for
he
saw
it
fussed
us
mentioned
you
to
his
honour
the
who
had
not
heard
you
were
coming
his
honour
will
follow
shortly
with
an
invitation
to
government
house
while
you
remain
in
bombay
which
will
not
be
many
days
i
do
doubt
for
there
is
nothing
in
this
city
of
plague
to
stop
for
later
on
during
your
progress
up
country
i
do
myself
the
honour
to
hope
that
you
will
stay
as
my
guests
for
as
long
as
you
choose
at
moozuffernuggar
my
first
impulse
was
to
answer
maharajah
we
dream
of
accepting
your
kind
invitation
but
on
second
thoughts
i
remembered
my
duty
to
my
proprietor
journalism
first
inclination
afterwards
my
letter
from
egypt
on
the
rescue
of
the
englishwoman
who
escaped
from
khartoum
had
brought
me
great
as
a
special
correspondent
and
the
now
billed
my
name
in
big
letters
on
its
placards
so
elworthy
wrote
me
here
was
another
noble
chance
must
i
not
strive
to
rise
to
it
two
english
ladies
at
a
native
court
in
rajputana
that
ought
to
afford
scope
for
some
rattling
journalism
is
extremely
kind
of
you
i
said
hesitating
it
would
give
us
great
pleasure
were
it
feasible
to
accept
your
friendly
offer
but
english
ideas
you
know
prince
two
unprotected
women
i
hardly
see
how
we
could
come
alone
to
moozuffernuggar
unchaperoned
the
maharajah
face
lighted
up
he
was
evidently
flattered
that
we
should
even
thus
dubiously
entertain
his
proposal
i
thought
about
that
too
he
answered
growing
more
colloquial
in
tone
been
some
days
in
bombay
making
inquiries
and
preparations
you
see
you
had
not
informed
the
authorities
of
your
intended
visit
so
that
you
were
travelling
or
should
it
be
and
if
tillington
had
written
to
let
me
know
your
movements
you
might
have
arrived
at
this
port
without
anybody
knowing
it
and
have
been
compelled
to
take
refuge
in
an
hotel
on
landing
he
spoke
as
if
we
had
been
accustomed
all
our
lives
long
to
be
received
with
red
cloth
by
the
mayor
and
corporation
and
presented
with
illuminated
addresses
and
the
freedom
of
the
city
in
a
gold
i
have
seen
to
all
that
the
will
be
down
before
long
and
i
have
arranged
that
if
you
consent
a
little
later
to
honour
my
humble
roof
in
rajputana
with
your
august
presence
major
balmossie
and
his
wife
will
accompany
you
and
chaperon
you
i
have
lived
in
england
of
course
i
understand
that
two
english
ladies
of
your
rank
and
position
can
not
travel
alone
as
if
you
were
americans
but
balmossie
is
a
nice
little
soul
of
unblemished
character
that
sweet
touch
charmed
me
at
government
house
he
had
learned
the
respect
due
to
grundy
that
if
you
will
accept
my
invitation
you
may
rest
assured
that
everything
will
be
done
with
the
utmost
regard
to
the
the
unaccountable
prejudices
of
europeans
his
thoughtfulness
took
me
aback
i
thanked
him
warmly
he
unbent
at
my
thanks
i
am
obliged
to
you
in
return
he
said
gives
me
real
pleasure
to
be
able
through
you
to
repay
harold
tillington
part
of
the
debt
i
owe
him
he
was
so
good
to
me
at
oxford
miss
cayley
you
are
new
to
india
and
therefore
as
yet
no
doubt
unprejudiced
you
treat
a
native
gentleman
i
see
like
a
human
being
i
hope
you
will
not
stop
long
enough
in
our
country
to
get
over
that
stage
as
happens
to
most
of
your
countrymen
and
countrywomen
in
england
a
man
like
myself
is
an
indian
prince
in
india
to
out
of
a
hundred
europeans
he
is
just
a
damned
nigger
i
smiled
sympathetically
think
i
said
venturing
under
these
circumstances
on
a
harmless
little
of
course
in
quotation
marks
may
trust
me
never
to
reach
point
i
believe
he
answered
you
are
a
friend
of
harold
tillington
ebony
or
ivory
he
never
forgot
we
were
two
men
together
illustration
who
your
black
friend
five
minutes
later
when
the
maharajah
had
gone
to
inquire
about
our
luggage
lord
southminster
strolled
up
i
say
miss
cayley
he
burst
out
off
now
but
remembah
that
offah
always
open
by
the
way
who
your
black
friend
i
could
help
laughing
at
the
airs
the
fellah
gave
himself
to
see
a
niggah
sitting
theah
with
his
suite
all
round
him
waving
his
hands
and
sunning
his
rings
and
behaving
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
a
gentleman
it
reahly
too
ridiculous
harold
tillington
picked
up
with
a
fellah
like
that
at
oxford
doosid
good
cricketer
too
wondah
if
this
is
the
same
one
lord
southminster
i
said
quietly
with
a
stiff
little
bow
on
your
side
that
your
offer
was
rejected
once
for
all
last
night
yes
the
indian
prince
harold
tillington
friend
the
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
whose
ancestors
were
princes
while
ours
were
dressed
in
woad
and
but
you
were
right
about
one
thing
behaves
like
a
gentleman
i
say
the
young
man
ejaculated
drawing
back
anothah
in
the
eye
for
me
you
a
good
at
facers
you
gave
me
one
for
a
welcome
and
you
give
me
one
now
for
a
parting
shot
nevah
mind
though
i
can
wait
you
backing
the
wrong
fellah
but
you
not
the
ethels
and
you
well
worth
waiting
for
he
waved
his
hand
see
yah
again
in
london
and
he
retired
with
that
fatuous
smile
still
absorbing
his
features
our
three
days
in
bombay
were
uneventful
we
merely
waited
to
get
rid
of
the
roll
of
the
ship
which
continued
to
haunt
us
for
hours
after
we
landed
the
floor
of
our
bedrooms
having
acquired
an
ugly
trick
of
rising
in
long
undulations
as
if
bombay
were
suffering
from
chronic
earthquake
we
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
honour
the
acting
governor
and
his
honour
consort
we
were
also
introduced
to
balmossie
the
lady
who
was
to
chaperon
us
to
moozuffernuggar
her
husband
was
a
soldierly
scotchman
from
forfarshire
but
she
herself
was
english
a
flighty
little
body
with
a
perpetual
giggle
she
giggled
so
much
over
the
idea
of
the
maharajah
inviting
us
to
his
palace
that
i
wondered
why
on
earth
she
accepted
his
invitation
at
this
she
seemed
surprised
it
one
of
the
jolliest
places
in
rajputana
she
answered
with
a
bland
simla
smile
picturesque
he
he
he
and
delightful
simpkin
flows
like
water
simpkin
baboo
english
for
champagne
you
know
he
he
he
and
though
of
course
the
maharajah
only
a
native
like
the
rest
of
them
he
he
he
still
he
been
educated
at
oxford
and
has
mixed
with
europeans
and
he
knows
how
to
make
one
he
he
he
well
thoroughly
comfortable
what
shall
we
eat
i
asked
ghee
and
chupatties
dear
no
he
he
he
europe
food
every
bit
of
it
foie
gras
and
york
ham
and
wine
his
hospitality
massive
if
it
for
that
of
course
one
would
dream
of
going
there
but
archie
hopes
some
day
to
be
made
resident
do
you
know
and
it
will
do
him
no
harm
he
he
he
with
the
foreign
office
to
have
cultivated
friendly
relations
beforehand
with
his
highness
of
moozuffernuggar
these
natives
he
he
he
so
absurdly
sensitive
for
myself
the
maharajah
interested
me
and
i
rather
liked
him
besides
he
was
harold
friend
and
that
was
in
itself
sufficient
recommendation
so
i
determined
to
push
straight
into
the
heart
of
native
india
first
and
only
afterwards
to
do
the
regulation
tourist
round
of
agra
and
delhi
the
taj
and
the
mosques
benares
and
allahabad
leaving
the
english
and
calcutta
for
the
of
my
journey
it
was
better
journalism
as
i
thought
that
thought
i
began
to
fear
that
elworthy
was
right
after
all
and
that
i
was
a
born
journalist
on
the
day
fixed
for
our
leaving
bombay
whom
should
i
meet
but
lord
southminster
with
the
maharajah
at
the
railway
station
he
lounged
up
to
me
with
that
eternal
smile
still
vaguely
pervading
his
empty
features
we
shall
have
a
jolly
party
i
gathah
he
said
tell
me
this
niggah
is
famous
for
his
tigahs
i
gazed
at
him
positively
taken
aback
do
mean
to
tell
me
i
cried
actually
propose
to
accept
the
maharajah
hospitality
his
smile
absorbed
him
he
answered
twirling
his
yellow
moustache
and
gazing
across
at
the
unconscious
prince
who
was
engaged
in
overlooking
the
arrangements
for
our
saloon
carriage
black
fellah
discovahed
i
was
a
cousin
of
harold
so
he
came
to
call
upon
me
at
the
club
of
which
some
johnnies
heah
made
me
an
honorary
membah
he
offahed
me
the
run
of
his
place
while
i
in
indiah
and
of
course
i
accepted
eccentric
sort
of
chap
ca
make
him
out
myself
says
anyone
connected
with
harold
tillington
is
always
deah
to
him
rum
start
is
it
is
a
mere
oriental
i
answered
to
the
ways
of
civilised
life
he
cherishes
the
superannuated
virtue
of
gratitude
no
doubt
so
i
coming
along
with
you
i
drew
back
horrified
while
i
am
there
after
what
i
told
you
last
week
on
the
steamer
that
all
right
i
bear
yah
no
malice
if
i
want
any
fun
of
course
i
must
go
while
at
moozuffernuggar
so
see
this
black
boundah
means
to
get
up
some
big
things
at
his
place
in
your
honah
and
one
naturally
goes
to
stop
with
anyone
who
has
big
things
to
offah
hang
it
all
what
does
it
mattah
who
a
fellah
is
if
he
can
give
yah
good
shooting
it
shooting
do
yah
know
that
keeps
society
in
england
togethah
therefore
you
propose
to
stop
in
the
same
house
with
me
i
exclaimed
spite
of
what
i
have
told
you
well
lord
southminster
i
should
have
thought
there
were
limits
which
even
taste
he
cut
me
short
with
an
inane
grin
you
make
your
blooming
little
erraw
he
answered
airily
told
yah
i
keep
my
offah
still
open
and
hang
it
all
i
do
mean
to
lose
sight
of
yah
in
a
hurry
some
other
fellah
might
come
along
and
pick
you
up
when
i
was
looking
and
i
do
want
to
miss
yah
in
point
of
fact
i
do
mind
telling
yah
i
back
myself
still
for
a
couple
of
thou
soonah
or
latah
to
marry
yah
it
dogged
as
does
it
faint
heart
they
say
nevah
won
fair
lady
if
it
had
not
been
that
i
could
not
bear
to
disappoint
my
indian
prince
i
think
when
i
heard
this
i
should
have
turned
back
then
and
there
at
the
station
the
journey
up
country
was
uneventful
but
dusty
the
mofussil
appears
to
consist
mainly
of
dust
indeed
i
can
now
recall
nothing
of
it
but
one
pervading
white
cloud
which
has
blotted
from
my
memory
all
its
other
components
the
dust
clung
to
my
hair
after
many
washings
and
was
never
really
beaten
out
of
my
travelling
clothes
i
believe
part
of
it
thus
went
round
the
world
with
me
to
england
when
at
last
we
reached
moozuffernuggar
after
two
days
and
a
night
hard
travelling
we
were
met
by
a
crowd
of
local
grandees
who
looked
as
if
they
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
lives
in
brushing
back
their
whiskers
and
we
drove
up
at
once
in
european
carriages
to
the
maharajah
palace
the
look
of
it
astonished
me
it
was
a
strange
and
rambling
old
hindoo
high
perched
on
a
scarped
crag
like
edinburgh
castle
and
accessible
only
on
one
side
up
a
gigantic
staircase
guarded
on
either
hand
by
huge
sculptured
elephants
cut
in
the
living
sandstone
below
clustered
the
town
an
intricate
mass
of
tangled
alleys
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
picturesque
or
so
dirty
in
my
life
as
for
elsie
she
was
divided
between
admiration
for
its
beauty
and
terror
at
the
and
attendants
sort
of
rooms
shall
we
have
i
whispered
to
our
moral
guarantee
balmossie
beautiful
dear
the
little
lady
smirked
back
throughout
he
he
he
by
liberty
the
maharajah
wants
to
do
honour
to
his
european
guests
he
he
he
he
fancies
poor
man
he
quite
european
that
what
comes
of
sending
these
creatures
to
oxford
so
he
had
suites
of
rooms
furnished
for
any
white
visitors
who
may
chance
to
come
his
way
ridiculous
is
it
champagne
oh
gallons
of
it
he
quite
proud
of
his
rooms
he
he
he
he
always
asking
people
to
come
and
occupy
them
he
thinks
he
done
them
up
in
the
best
style
of
decoration
he
had
reason
for
they
were
as
tasteful
as
they
were
dainty
and
comfortable
and
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
why
his
hospitable
inclination
should
be
voted
but
balmossie
appeared
to
find
all
natives
alike
a
huge
joke
together
she
never
even
spoke
of
them
without
a
condescending
smile
of
distant
compassion
indeed
most
seem
first
to
do
their
best
to
anglicise
the
hindoo
and
then
to
laugh
at
him
for
aping
the
englishman
after
we
had
been
three
days
at
the
palace
and
had
spent
hours
in
the
wonderful
temples
and
ruins
the
maharajah
announced
with
considerable
pride
at
breakfast
one
morning
that
he
had
got
up
a
in
our
special
honour
lord
southminster
rubbed
his
hands
that
right
maharaj
he
said
briskly
do
love
big
game
to
tell
yah
the
truth
old
man
that
just
what
i
came
heah
for
do
me
too
much
honour
the
hindoo
answered
with
quiet
sarcasm
town
and
palace
may
have
little
to
offer
that
is
worth
your
attention
but
i
am
glad
that
my
big
game
at
least
has
been
lucky
enough
to
attract
you
the
remark
was
thrown
away
on
the
young
man
he
had
described
his
host
to
me
as
black
boundah
out
of
his
own
mouth
i
condemned
him
he
supplied
the
very
word
he
was
himself
nothing
more
than
a
born
bounder
illustration
a
is
not
a
thing
to
be
got
up
lightly
during
the
next
few
days
the
preparations
for
the
occupied
all
the
maharajah
energies
know
miss
cayley
he
said
to
me
as
we
stood
upon
the
big
stairs
looking
down
on
the
hindoo
city
is
not
a
thing
to
be
got
up
lightly
our
people
themselves
do
like
killing
a
tiger
they
reverence
it
too
much
they
afraid
its
spirit
might
haunt
them
afterwards
and
bring
them
bad
luck

of
our
superstitions
do
not
share
it
yourself
then
i
asked
he
drew
himself
up
and
opened
his
palms
with
a
twinkling
of
pendant
emeralds
am
royal
he
answered
with
naÃ¯ve
dignity
the
tiger
is
a
royal
beast
kings
know
the
ways
of
kings
if
a
king
kills
what
is
kingly
it
owes
him
no
grudge
for
it
but
if
a
common
man
or
a
low
caste
man
were
to
kill
a
tiger
who
can
say
what
might
happen
i
saw
he
was
not
himself
quite
free
from
the
superstition
peasants
he
went
on
fixing
me
with
his
great
black
eyes
even
mention
the
tiger
by
name
for
fear
of
offending
him
they
believe
him
to
be
the
of
a
powerful
spirit
if
they
wish
to
speak
of
him
they
say
the
great
beast
or
my
lord
the
striped
one
some
think
the
spirit
is
immortal
except
at
the
hands
of
a
king
but
they
have
no
objection
to
see
him
destroyed
by
others
they
will
even
point
out
his
whereabouts
and
rejoice
over
his
death
for
it
relieves
the
village
of
a
serious
enemy
and
they
believe
the
spirit
will
only
haunt
the
huts
of
those
who
actually
kill
him
you
know
where
each
tiger
lives
i
asked
well
as
your
gamekeepers
in
england
know
which
covert
may
be
drawn
for
foxes
yes
is
a
royal
sport
and
we
keep
it
for
maharajahs
i
myself
never
hunt
a
tiger
till
some
european
visitor
of
distinction
comes
to
moozuffernuggar
that
i
may
show
him
good
sport
this
tiger
we
shall
hunt
for
example
he
is
a
bad
old
hand
he
has
carried
off
the
buffaloes
of
my
villagers
over
yonder
for
years
and
years
and
of
late
he
has
also
become
a
he
once
ate
a
whole
family
at
a
meal
a
man
his
wife
and
his
three
children
the
people
at
janwargurh
have
been
pestering
me
for
weeks
to
come
and
shoot
him
and
each
week
he
has
eaten
somebody
a
child
or
a
woman
the
last
was
yesterday
but
i
waited
till
you
came
because
i
thought
it
would
be
something
to
show
you
that
you
would
not
be
likely
to
see
elsewhere
you
let
the
poor
people
go
on
being
eaten
that
we
might
enjoy
this
sport
i
cried
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
opened
his
palms
were
villagers
you
know
ryots
mere
tillers
of
the
soil
poor
naked
peasants
i
have
thousands
of
them
to
spare
if
a
tiger
eats
ten
of
them
they
only
say
it
was
written
upon
their
foreheads
one
woman
more
or
less
who
would
notice
her
at
moozuffernuggar
then
i
perceived
that
the
maharajah
was
a
gentleman
but
still
a
barbarian
the
eventful
morning
arrived
at
last
and
we
started
all
agog
for
the
jungle
where
the
tiger
was
known
to
live
elsie
excused
herself
she
remarked
to
me
the
night
before
as
i
brushed
her
back
hair
for
her
that
she
had
a
mind
not
to
go
dear
i
answered
giving
the
brush
a
good
dash
a
higher
mathematician
that
phrase
lacks
accuracy
if
you
were
to
say
of
a
mind
it
would
be
nearer
the
mark
in
point
of
fact
if
you
ask
my
opinion
your
inclination
to
go
is
a
vanishing
quantity
she
admitted
the
impeachment
with
an
accusing
blush
quite
right
brownie
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
afraid
of
it
am
i
dear
horribly
afraid
between
ourselves
i
in
a
deadly
funk
of
it
but
the
brave
man
is
not
he
that
feels
no
fear
and
i
believe
the
same
principle
applies
almost
equally
to
the
brave
woman
i
mean
that
fear
to
subdue
as
far
as
i
am
able
the
maharajah
says
i
shall
be
the
first
girl
who
has
ever
gone
i
frightened
out
of
my
life
i
never
held
a
gun
in
my
born
days
before
but
elsie
recollect
this
is
journalism
i
intend
to
go
through
with
it
offer
yourself
on
the
altar
brownie
do
dear
i
propose
to
die
in
the
cause
i
expect
my
proprietor
to
carve
on
my
tomb
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
martyr
of
journalism
she
was
killed
in
the
act
of
taking
shorthand
notes
by
a
bengal
tiger
we
started
at
early
dawn
a
motley
mixture
my
short
bicycling
skirt
did
beautifully
for
there
was
a
vast
company
of
native
swells
nawabs
and
ranas
in
gorgeous
costumes
whose
precise
names
and
titles
i
do
not
pretend
to
remember
there
were
also
major
balmossie
lord
southminster
the
maharajah
and
myself
all
mounted
on
elephants
we
had
likewise
on
foot
a
miserable
crowd
of
wretched
beaters
with
dirty
white
we
were
all
very
brave
of
course
demonstratively
brave
and
we
talked
a
great
deal
at
the
start
about
the
exhilaration
given
by
spice
of
danger
but
it
somehow
struck
me
that
the
poor
beaters
on
foot
had
the
majority
of
the
danger
and
extremely
little
of
the
exhilaration
each
of
us
great
folk
was
mounted
on
his
own
elephant
which
carried
a
light
howdah
in
two
compartments
the
front
one
intended
for
the
noble
sportsman
the
back
one
for
a
servant
with
extra
guns
and
ammunition
i
pretended
to
like
it
but
i
fear
i
trembled
visibly
our
mahouts
sat
on
the
elephants
necks
each
armed
with
a
pointed
goad
to
whose
admonition
the
huge
beasts
answered
like
a
born
journalist
always
pretends
to
know
everything
before
hand
so
i
speak
carelessly
of
the
as
if
he
were
a
familiar
acquaintance
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
aside
in
confidence
that
i
had
only
just
learnt
the
word
that
morning
the
maharajah
protested
at
first
against
my
taking
part
in
the
actual
hunt
but
i
think
his
protest
was
merely
formal
in
his
heart
of
hearts
i
believe
he
was
proud
that
the
first
lady
should
have
joined
his
party
dusty
and
shadeless
the
road
from
moozuffernuggar
fares
straight
across
the
plain
towards
the
crumbling
mountains
behind
in
the
heat
mist
the
castle
and
palace
on
their
crag
with
the
squalid
town
that
clustered
at
their
feet
reminded
me
once
more
most
strangely
of
edinburgh
where
i
used
to
spend
my
vacations
from
girton
but
the
pitiless
sun
differed
greatly
from
the
gray
haar
of
the
northern
metropolis
it
warmed
into
intense
white
the
little
temples
of
the
wayside
and
beat
on
our
heads
with
tropical
garishness
i
am
bound
to
admit
also
that
is
not
quite
all
it
is
cracked
up
to
be
in
my
fancy
i
had
pictured
the
gallant
and
bloodthirsty
beast
rushing
out
upon
us
full
pelt
from
some
nullah
at
the
first
sniff
of
our
presence
and
fiercely
attacking
both
men
and
elephants
instead
of
that
i
will
confess
the
whole
truth
frightened
as
at
least
one
of
us
was
of
the
tiger
the
tiger
was
still
more
desperately
frightened
of
his
human
assailants
i
could
see
clearly
that
so
far
from
rushing
out
of
his
own
accord
to
attack
us
his
one
desire
was
to
be
let
alone
he
was
horribly
afraid
he
skulked
in
the
jungle
like
a
wary
old
fox
in
a
trusty
spinney
there
was
no
nullah
whatever
a
nullah
may
be
there
was
only
a
waste
of
dusty
we
encircled
the
tall
grass
patch
where
he
lurked
forming
a
big
round
with
a
of
elephants
the
beaters
on
foot
advancing
half
naked
with
a
caution
with
which
i
could
fully
sympathise
endeavoured
by
loud
shouts
and
gesticulations
to
rouse
the
royal
beast
to
a
sense
of
his
position
not
a
bit
of
it
the
royal
beast
declined
to
be
drawn
he
preferred
retirement
the
maharajah
whose
elephant
was
stationed
next
to
mine
even
apologised
for
the
resolute
cowardice
with
which
he
clung
to
his
ignoble
the
beaters
drew
in
the
elephants
raising
their
trunks
in
air
and
sniffing
suspicion
moved
slowly
inward
we
had
girt
him
round
now
with
a
perfect
ring
through
which
he
could
not
possibly
break
without
attacking
somebody
the
maharajah
kept
a
fixed
eye
on
my
personal
safety
but
still
the
royal
animal
crouched
and
skulked
and
still
the
black
beaters
shrieked
howled
and
gesticulated
at
last
among
the
tall
perpendicular
lights
and
shadows
of
the
big
grasses
and
bamboos
i
seemed
to
see
something
move
something
striped
like
the
stems
yet
passing
slowly
slowly
slowly
between
them
it
moved
in
a
stealthy
undulating
line
no
one
could
believe
till
he
saw
it
how
the
bright
bands
of
vivid
on
the
monster
flanks
and
the
interspersed
black
stripes
could
fade
away
and
harmonise
in
their
native
surroundings
with
the
lights
and
shades
of
the
upright
jungle
it
was
a
marvel
of
mimicry
there
i
cried
to
the
maharajah
pointing
one
eager
hand
is
that
thing
there
moving
he
stared
where
i
pointed
jove
he
cried
raising
his
rifle
with
a
sportsman
quickness
have
spotted
him
first
the
tiger
the
terrified
beast
stole
slowly
and
cautiously
through
the
tall
grasses
his
lithe
silken
side
gliding
in
and
out
snakewise
and
only
his
fierce
eyes
burning
bright
with
gleaming
flashes
between
the
gloom
of
the
jungle
once
i
had
seen
him
i
could
follow
with
ease
his
sinuous
path
among
the
tangled
bamboos
a
waving
line
of
beauty
in
perpetual
motion
the
maharajah
followed
him
too
with
his
keen
eyes
and
pointed
his
rifle
hastily
but
quick
as
he
was
lord
southminster
was
before
him
i
had
half
expected
to
find
the
young
man
turn
coward
at
the
last
moment
but
in
that
i
was
mistaken
i
will
do
him
the
justice
to
say
whatever
else
he
was
he
was
a
born
sportsman
the
gleam
of
joy
in
his
leaden
eye
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
tiger
the
flush
of
excitement
on
his
pasty
face
the
eagerness
of
his
alert
attitude
were
things
to
see
and
remember
that
moment
almost
ennobled
him
in
sight
of
danger
the
best
instincts
of
the
savage
seemed
to
revive
within
him
in
civilised
life
he
was
a
poor
creature
face
to
face
with
a
wild
beast
he
became
a
mighty
shikari
perhaps
that
was
why
he
was
so
fond
of
shooting
he
may
have
felt
it
raised
him
in
the
scale
of
being
he
lifted
his
rifle
and
fired
he
was
a
cool
shot
and
he
wounded
the
beast
upon
its
left
shoulder
i
could
see
the
great
crimson
stream
gush
out
all
at
once
across
the
shapely
sides
staining
the
stripes
and
reddening
the
black
shadows
the
tiger
drew
back
gave
a
low
fierce
growl
and
then
crouched
among
the
jungle
i
saw
he
was
going
to
leap
he
bent
his
huge
backbone
into
a
strong
downward
curve
took
in
a
deep
breath
and
stood
at
bay
glaring
at
us
which
elephant
would
he
attack
that
was
what
he
was
now
debating
next
moment
with
a
frightful
he
had
straightened
out
his
muscles
and
like
a
bolt
from
a
bow
had
launched
his
huge
bulk
forward
i
never
saw
his
charge
i
never
knew
he
had
leapt
upon
me
i
only
felt
my
elephant
rock
from
side
to
side
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
he
was
trumpeting
shaking
roaring
with
rage
and
pain
for
the
tiger
was
on
his
flanks
its
claws
buried
deep
in
the
skin
of
his
forehead
i
could
not
keep
my
seat
i
felt
myself
tossed
about
in
the
frail
howdah
like
a
pill
in
a
the
elephant
in
a
death
grapple
was
trying
to
shake
off
his
ghastly
enemy
for
a
minute
or
two
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
save
this
swinging
movement
then
opening
my
eyes
for
a
second
i
saw
the
tiger
in
all
his
terrible
beauty
clinging
to
the
head
by
the
claws
of
his
fore
paws
and
struggling
for
a
foothold
on
its
trunk
with
his
mighty
hind
legs
in
a
wounded
agony
of
despair
and
vengeance
he
would
sell
his
life
dear
he
would
have
one
or
other
of
us
lord
southminster
raised
his
rifle
again
but
the
maharajah
shouted
aloud
in
an
angry
voice
fire
do
fire
you
will
kill
the
lady
you
ca
aim
at
him
like
that
the
beast
is
rocking
so
that
no
one
can
say
where
a
shot
will
take
effect
down
with
your
gun
sir
instantly
illustration
it
went
off
unexpectedly
my
mahout
unable
to
keep
his
seat
with
the
rocking
now
dropped
off
his
cushion
among
the
scrub
below
he
could
speak
a
few
words
of
english
mem
sahib
shoot
he
cried
flinging
his
hands
up
but
i
was
tossed
to
and
fro
from
side
to
side
with
my
rifle
under
my
arm
it
was
impossible
to
aim
yet
in
sheer
terror
i
tried
to
draw
the
trigger
i
failed
but
somehow
i
caught
my
rifle
against
the
side
of
my
cage
something
snapped
in
it
somewhere
it
went
off
unexpectedly
without
my
aiming
or
firing
i
shut
my
eyes
when
i
opened
them
again
i
saw
a
swimming
picture
of
the
great
sullen
beast
loosing
his
hold
on
the
elephant
i
saw
his
brindled
face
i
saw
his
white
tusks
but
his
gleaming
pupils
burned
bright
no
longer
his
jaw
was
full
towards
me
i
had
shot
him
between
the
eyes
he
fell
slowly
with
blood
streaming
from
his
nostrils
and
his
tongue
lolling
out
his
muscles
relaxed
his
huge
limbs
grew
limp
in
a
minute
he
lay
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
ground
with
his
head
on
one
side
a
grand
terrible
picture
my
mahout
flung
up
his
hands
in
wonder
and
amazement
father
he
cried
aloud
the
mem
sahib
is
a
great
shikari
the
maharajah
stretched
across
to
me
was
a
wonderful
shot
he
exclaimed
could
never
have
believed
a
woman
could
show
such
nerve
and
coolness
nerve
and
coolness
indeed
i
was
trembling
all
over
like
an
italian
greyhound
every
limb
a
jelly
and
i
had
not
even
fired
the
rifle
went
off
of
itself
without
me
i
am
innocent
of
having
ever
endangered
the
life
of
a
haycock
but
once
more
i
dissembled
it
a
difficult
shot
i
said
jauntily
as
if
i
rather
liked
did
think
i
hit
him
still
the
effect
of
my
speech
was
somewhat
marred
i
fear
by
the
tears
that
in
spite
of
me
rolled
down
my
cheek
silently
honah
i
nevah
saw
a
finah
piece
of
shooting
in
my
life
lord
southminster
drawled
out
then
he
added
aside
in
an
undertone
a
fellow
moah
determined
to
annex
her
than
evah
i
sat
in
my
howdah
half
dazed
i
hardly
heard
what
they
were
saying
my
heart
danced
like
the
elephant
then
it
stood
still
within
me
i
was
only
aware
of
a
feeling
of
faintness
luckily
for
my
reputation
as
a
mighty
sportswoman
however
i
just
managed
to
keep
up
and
did
not
actually
faint
as
i
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
do
next
followed
the
native
pÃ¦an
the
beaters
crowded
round
the
fallen
beast
in
a
chorus
of
congratulation
many
of
the
villagers
also
ran
out
with
prayers
and
ejaculations
to
swell
our
triumph
it
was
all
like
a
dream
they
hustled
round
me
and
salaamed
to
me
a
woman
had
shot
him
wonderful
a
babel
of
voices
resounded
in
my
ears
i
was
aware
that
pure
accident
had
elevated
me
into
a
heroine
the
beast
on
a
pad
elephant
the
maharajah
called
out
the
beaters
tied
ropes
round
his
body
and
raised
him
with
difficulty
the
maharajah
face
grew
stern
are
the
whiskers
he
asked
fiercely
in
his
own
tongue
which
major
balmossie
interpreted
for
me
the
beaters
and
the
villagers
bowing
low
and
expanding
their
hands
made
profuse
expressions
of
ignorance
and
innocence
but
the
fact
was
patent
the
grand
face
had
been
mangled
while
they
had
crowded
in
a
dense
group
round
the
fallen
carcass
somebody
had
cut
off
the
lips
and
whiskers
and
secreted
them
have
ruined
the
skin
the
maharajah
cried
out
in
angry
tones
intended
it
for
the
lady
i
shall
have
them
all
searched
and
the
man
who
has
done
this
thing
illustration
i
saw
him
now
the
oriental
despot
he
broke
off
and
looked
around
him
his
silence
was
more
terrible
by
far
than
the
fiercest
threat
i
saw
him
now
the
oriental
despot
all
the
natives
drew
back
voice
of
a
king
is
the
voice
of
a
great
god
my
mahout
murmured
in
a
solemn
whisper
then
nobody
else
said
anything
do
they
want
the
whiskers
i
asked
just
to
set
things
straight
again
seem
to
have
been
in
a
precious
hurry
to
take
them
the
maharajah
brow
cleared
he
turned
to
me
once
more
with
his
european
manner
tiger
body
has
wonderful
power
after
his
death
he
answered
fangs
and
his
claws
are
very
potent
charms
his
heart
gives
courage
whoever
eats
of
it
will
never
know
fear
his
liver
preserves
against
death
and
pestilence
but
the
highest
virtue
of
all
exists
in
his
whiskers
they
are
mighty
talismans
chopped
up
in
food
they
act
as
a
slow
poison
which
no
doctor
can
detect
no
antidote
guard
against
they
are
also
a
sovereign
remedy
against
magic
or
the
evil
eye
and
administered
to
women
they
make
an
irresistible
philtre
a
puissant
they
secure
you
the
heart
of
whoever
drinks
them
give
a
couple
of
monkeys
for
those
whiskahs
lord
southminster
murmured
half
unnoticed
we
began
to
move
again
go
on
to
where
we
know
there
is
another
tiger
the
maharajah
said
lightly
as
if
tigers
were
partridges
cayley
you
will
come
with
us
i
rested
on
my
laurels
i
was
quivering
still
from
head
to
foot
thank
you
maharajah
as
unconcernedly
as
i
could
had
quite
enough
sport
for
my
first
day
i
think
i
go
back
now
and
write
a
newspaper
account
of
this
little
adventure
have
had
luck
he
put
in
everyone
kills
a
tiger
his
first
day
out
this
will
make
good
reading
would
have
missed
it
for
a
hundred
pounds
i
answered
try
another
would
try
another
for
a
thousand
i
cried
fervently
that
evening
at
the
palace
i
was
the
heroine
of
the
day
they
toasted
me
in
a
bumper
of
heidsieck
dry
monopole
the
men
made
speeches
everybody
talked
gushingly
of
my
splendid
courage
and
my
steadiness
of
hand
it
was
a
brilliant
shot
under
such
difficult
circumstances
for
myself
i
said
nothing
i
pretended
to
look
modest
i
dared
not
confess
the
truth
that
i
never
fired
at
all
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
confessed
it
till
i
write
it
down
now
in
these
confiding
memoirs
illustration
it
i
who
am
the
winnah
one
episode
cast
a
gloom
over
my
triumph
in
the
course
of
the
evening
a
telegram
arrived
for
the
young
man
by
a
messenger
he
read
it
and
crumpled
it
up
carelessly
in
his
hand
i
looked
inquiry
he
answered
nodding
quite
right
it
that
pooah
old
marmy
has
gone
aftah
all
ezekiel
and
habakkuk
have
carried
off
his
sixteen
stone
at
last
and
i
do
mind
telling
yah
now
though
it
was
a
neah
thing
it
who
am
the
winnah
x
the
adventure
of
the
the
weather
as
it
is
humorously
called
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
and
the
young
ladies
in
sailor
hats
and
cambric
blouses
who
flock
to
india
each
autumn
for
the
annual
were
beginning
to
resign
themselves
to
a
return
to
england
unless
of
course
they
had
succeeded
in
so
i
realised
that
i
must
hurry
on
to
delhi
and
agra
if
i
was
not
to
be
intercepted
by
the
intolerable
summer
when
we
started
from
moozuffernuggar
for
delhi
and
the
east
lord
southminster
was
starting
for
bombay
and
europe
this
surprised
me
not
a
little
for
he
had
confided
to
my
unsympathetic
ear
a
few
nights
earlier
in
the
maharajah
that
he
was
broke
and
must
wait
at
moozuffernuggar
for
lack
of
funds
the
laid
at
his
banker
in
england
his
conversation
enlarged
my
vocabulary
at
any
rate
you
managed
to
get
away
i
exclaimed
as
he
dawdled
up
to
me
at
the
hot
and
dusty
station
he
drawled
fixing
his
and
lighting
a
cigarette
managed
to
get
away
maharaj
seems
to
have
thought
it
would
be
cheepah
in
the
end
to
pay
me
out
than
to
keep
me
do
mean
to
say
he
offered
to
lend
you
money
i
cried
not
exactly
that
offahed
to
borrow
it
the
man
you
call
a
nigger
his
smile
spread
broader
over
his
face
than
ever
we
borrow
from
the
jews
yah
know
he
said
pleasantly
why
the
jooce
should
we
borrow
from
the
heathen
also
spoiling
the
egyptians
do
yah
see
the
same
as
we
used
to
read
about
in
the
scripchah
when
we
were
innocent
kiddies
like
marriage
quite
you
borrow
in
haste
and
repay
at
leisure
he
strolled
off
and
took
his
seat
i
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
at
the
main
line
junction
in
accordance
with
my
usual
merciful
custom
i
spare
you
the
details
of
our
visit
to
agra
muttra
benares
at
calcutta
elsie
left
me
her
health
was
now
quite
restored
dear
little
soul
i
felt
i
had
done
that
one
good
thing
in
life
if
no
other
and
she
could
no
longer
withstand
the
higher
mathematics
which
were
beckoning
her
to
london
with
invisible
fingers
for
myself
having
so
far
accomplished
my
original
design
of
going
round
the
world
with
twopence
in
my
pocket
i
could
not
bear
to
draw
back
at
half
the
circuit
and
elworthy
having
willingly
consented
to
my
return
by
singapore
and
yokohama
i
set
out
alone
on
my
homeward
journey
illustration
he
wrote
i
expect
you
to
come
back
to
england
and
marry
me
harold
wrote
me
from
london
that
all
was
going
well
he
had
found
the
will
which
i
drew
up
at
florence
in
his
uncle
escritoire
and
everything
was
left
to
him
but
he
trusted
in
spite
of
this
untoward
circumstance
long
absence
might
have
altered
my
determination
lois
he
wrote
you
to
come
back
to
england
and
marry
me
i
was
brief
but
categorical
nothing
meanwhile
had
altered
my
resolve
i
did
not
wish
to
be
considered
mercenary
while
he
was
rich
and
honoured
i
could
never
take
him
if
some
day
fortune
frowned
but
there
let
us
not
forestall
the
feet
of
calamity
let
us
await
contingencies
still
i
was
heavy
in
heart
if
only
it
had
been
otherwise
to
say
the
truth
i
should
be
thrown
away
on
a
millionaire
but
just
think
what
a
splendid
managing
wife
a
girl
like
me
would
have
made
for
a
penniless
pauper
at
yokohama
however
while
i
dawdled
in
curiosity
shops
a
telegram
from
harold
startled
me
into
seriousness
my
chance
at
last
i
knew
what
it
meant
that
villain
higginson
home
at
once
i
want
your
evidence
to
clear
my
character
southminster
opposes
the
will
as
a
forgery
he
has
a
strong
case
the
experts
are
with
him
forgery
that
was
clever
i
never
thought
of
that
i
suspected
them
of
trying
to
forge
a
will
of
their
own
but
to
upset
the
real
one
to
throw
the
burden
of
suspicion
on
harold
shoulders
how
much
subtler
and
craftier
i
saw
at
a
glance
it
gave
them
every
advantage
in
the
first
place
it
put
harold
virtually
in
the
place
of
the
accused
and
compelled
him
to
defend
instead
of
attacking
an
attitude
which
prejudices
people
against
one
from
the
outset
then
again
it
implied
positive
criminality
on
his
part
and
so
allowed
lord
southminster
to
assume
the
air
of
injured
innocence
the
eldest
son
of
the
eldest
brother
unjustly
set
aside
by
the
scheming
machinations
of
an
unscrupulous
cousin
primogeniture
the
ingrained
english
love
for
keeping
up
the
dignity
of
a
noble
family
the
prejudice
in
favour
of
the
direct
male
line
as
against
the
female
all
were
astutely
utilised
in
lord
southminster
interest
but
worst
of
all
it
was
who
had
typewritten
the
will
i
a
friend
of
harold
a
woman
whom
lord
southminster
would
doubtless
try
to
exhibit
as
his
i
saw
at
once
how
much
like
conspiracy
it
looked
harold
and
i
had
agreed
together
to
concoct
a
false
document
and
harold
had
forged
his
uncle
signature
to
it
could
a
british
jury
doubt
when
a
lord
declared
it
fortunately
i
was
just
in
time
to
catch
the
canadian
steamer
from
japan
to
vancouver
but
oh
the
endless
breadth
of
that
broad
pacific
how
time
seemed
to
lag
as
each
day
one
rose
in
the
morning
in
the
midst
of
space
blue
sky
overhead
behind
one
the
hard
horizon
in
front
of
one
the
hard
horizon
and
nothing
else
visible
then
steamed
on
all
day
to
arrive
at
night
where
why
in
the
midst
of
space
starry
sky
overhead
behind
one
the
dim
horizon
in
front
of
one
the
dim
horizon
and
nothing
else
visible
the
nile
was
child
play
to
it
illustration
it
was
endlessly
wearisome
day
after
day
we
steamed
and
night
after
night
were
still
where
we
began
in
the
centre
of
the
sea
no
farther
from
our
no
nearer
to
our
goal
yet
for
ever
steaming
it
was
endlessly
wearisome
who
could
say
what
might
be
happening
meanwhile
in
england
at
last
after
months
as
it
seemed
of
this
slow
torture
we
reached
vancouver
there
in
the
raw
new
town
a
telegram
awaited
me
to
hear
you
are
coming
make
all
haste
you
may
be
just
in
time
to
arrive
for
the
trial
just
in
time
i
would
not
waste
a
moment
i
caught
the
first
train
on
the
canadian
pacific
and
travelled
straight
through
day
and
night
to
montreal
and
quebec
without
one
hour
interval
i
can
not
describe
to
you
that
journey
across
a
continent
i
had
never
before
seen
it
was
endless
and
hopeless
i
only
know
that
we
crawled
up
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
selkirk
range
over
viaducts
with
interminable
effort
and
that
the
prairies
were
just
the
broad
pacific
over
again
they
rolled
on
for
ever
but
we
did
reach
quebec
in
time
we
reached
it
and
we
caught
by
an
hour
the
first
liner
to
liverpool
at
prince
another
telegram
awaited
me
on
at
once
case
now
proceeding
harold
is
in
court
we
need
your
georgina
fawley
i
might
still
be
in
time
to
vindicate
harold
character
at
euston
to
my
surprise
i
was
met
not
only
by
my
dear
cantankerous
old
lady
but
also
by
my
friend
the
magnificent
maharajah
dressed
this
time
in
a
and
silk
hat
of
bond
street
glossiness
has
brought
you
to
england
i
asked
astonished
jubilee
he
smiled
and
showed
his
two
fine
rows
of
white
teeth
nominally
in
reality
the
cricket
season
i
play
for
berks
but
most
of
all
to
see
dear
tillington
safe
through
this
trouble
a
brick
lady
georgina
cried
with
enthusiasm
regular
brick
my
dear
lois
his
carriage
is
waiting
outside
to
take
you
up
to
my
house
he
has
stood
by
harold
well
like
a
christian
a
hindu
the
maharajah
corrected
smiling
how
have
you
been
all
this
time
dear
lady
georgina
i
asked
hardly
daring
to
inquire
about
what
was
nearest
to
my
soul
harold
the
cantankerous
old
lady
knitted
her
brows
in
a
familiar
fashion
my
dear
do
ask
i
have
known
a
happy
hour
since
you
left
me
in
switzerland
lois
i
shall
never
be
happy
again
without
you
it
would
pay
me
to
give
you
a
retaining
fee
of
a
thousand
a
year
honour
bright
it
would
i
assure
you
what
i
suffered
from
the
gretchens
since
you
been
in
the
east
has
only
been
equalled
by
what
i
suffered
from
the
mary
annes
and
the
cÃ©lestines
not
a
hair
left
on
my
scalp
not
one
hair
i
declare
to
you
they
made
my
head
into
a
for
the
various
restorers
george
sims
and
allen
are
going
to
fight
it
out
between
them
my
dear
i
wish
could
take
my
place
i
always
said
i
finished
the
speech
for
her
lady
can
do
better
whatever
she
turns
her
hand
to
than
any
of
these
hussies
she
nodded
why
because
her
hands
hands
while
as
for
the
gretchens
and
the
mary
annes
paws
is
the
only
word
one
can
honestly
apply
to
them
then
on
top
of
it
all
comes
this
trouble
about
harold
so
distressing
is
it
you
see
at
the
point
which
the
matter
has
reached
it
simply
impossible
to
save
harold
reputation
without
wrecking
southminster
pretty
position
that
for
a
respectable
family
the
ashursts
hitherto
have
been
respectable
a
or
two
perhaps
but
never
anything
serious
now
either
southminster
sends
harold
to
prison
or
harold
sends
southminster
there
a
nice
sort
of
dilemma
i
always
knew
kynaston
boys
were
born
fools
but
to
find
they
born
knaves
too
is
hard
on
an
old
woman
in
her
hairless
dotage
however
come
my
child
and
soon
set
things
right
you
the
one
person
on
earth
i
can
trust
in
this
matter
harold
go
to
prison
my
head
reeled
at
the
thought
i
staggered
out
into
the
open
air
and
took
my
seat
mechanically
in
the
maharajah
carriage
all
london
swam
before
me
after
so
many
months
absence
the
polychromatic
decorations
of
our
english
streets
looming
up
through
the
smoke
seemed
both
strange
and
familiar
i
drove
through
the
first
half
mile
with
a
vague
consciousness
that
lipton
tea
is
the
perfection
of
cocoa
and
matchless
for
the
complexion
but
that
it
dyes
all
colours
and
wo
wash
clothes
after
a
while
however
i
woke
up
to
the
full
terror
of
the
situation
are
you
taking
me
i
inquired
my
house
dear
lady
georgina
answered
looking
anxiously
at
me
for
my
face
was
bloodless
that
wo
do
i
answered
cue
must
be
now
to
keep
myself
as
aloof
as
possible
from
harold
and
harold
backers
i
must
put
up
at
an
hotel
it
will
sound
so
much
better
in
quite
right
the
maharajah
broke
in
with
sudden
conviction
must
block
every
ball
with
these
nasty
swift
bowlers
harold
i
asked
after
another
pause
did
he
come
to
meet
me
dear
how
could
he
he
under
examination
a
with
an
odious
leer
southminster
chosen
the
biggest
bully
at
the
bar
to
support
his
contention
to
some
hotel
in
the
jermyn
street
district
i
cried
to
the
maharajah
coachman
will
be
handy
for
the
law
courts
he
touched
his
hat
and
turned
in
a
sort
of
dickey
behind
sat
two
rajput
servants
that
evening
harold
came
round
to
visit
me
at
my
rooms
i
could
see
he
was
much
agitated
things
had
gone
very
badly
lady
georgina
was
there
she
had
stopped
to
dine
with
me
dear
old
thing
lest
i
should
feel
lonely
and
give
way
so
had
elsie
petheridge
elworthy
sent
a
telegram
of
welcome
from
devonshire
i
knew
at
least
that
my
friends
were
rallying
round
me
in
this
hour
of
trial
the
kind
maharajah
himself
would
have
come
too
if
i
had
allowed
him
but
i
thought
it
inexpedient
they
explained
everything
to
me
harold
had
propounded
will
the
one
i
drew
up
at
florence
and
had
asked
for
probate
lord
southminster
intervened
and
opposed
the
grant
of
probate
on
the
ground
that
the
signatures
were
forgeries
he
propounded
instead
another
will
drawn
some
twenty
years
earlier
when
they
were
both
children
duly
executed
at
the
time
and
undoubtedly
genuine
in
it
testator
left
everything
without
reserve
to
the
eldest
son
of
his
eldest
brother
lord
kynaston
did
know
in
those
days
that
kynaston
sons
would
all
grow
up
fools
lady
georgina
said
tartly
which
that
was
before
the
poor
dear
soul
took
to
plunging
on
the
stock
exchange
and
made
his
money
he
had
nothing
to
leave
then
but
his
best
silk
hat
and
a
few
paltry
hundreds
afterwards
when
he
feathered
his
nest
in
soap
and
cocoa
he
discovered
that
bertie
that
lord
southminster
was
a
idiot
marmy
never
liked
southminster
nor
southminster
marmy
for
after
all
with
all
his
faults
marmy
a
gentleman
while
bertie
well
my
dear
we
need
put
a
name
to
it
so
he
altered
his
will
as
you
know
when
he
saw
the
sort
of
man
southminster
turned
out
and
left
practically
everything
he
possessed
to
harold
are
the
witnesses
to
the
will
i
asked
the
trouble
who
do
you
think
why
higginson
sister
who
was
marmy
and
a
waiter
franz
markheim
at
the
hotel
at
florence
who
dead
they
say
or
at
least
not
forthcoming
higginson
sister
forswears
her
signature
harold
added
gloomily
the
experts
are
most
of
them
dead
against
the
genuineness
of
my
uncle
clever
i
said
leaning
back
and
taking
it
in
slowly
sister
how
well
they
worked
it
they
could
prevent
ashurst
from
making
this
will
but
they
managed
to
supply
their
own
tainted
witnesses
if
it
had
been
higginson
himself
now
he
have
had
to
be
and
in
of
course
we
could
have
shaken
his
credit
by
bringing
up
the
episodes
of
the
count
de
and
but
his
sister
what
she
like
have
you
anything
against
her
dear
lady
georgina
cried
the
rogue
has
bested
us
is
it
just
like
him
what
do
you
suppose
he
has
done
why
provided
himself
with
a
sister
of
tried
respectability
and
blameless
character
she
denies
that
it
is
her
handwriting
i
asked
on
her
bible
oath
she
never
signed
the
document
i
was
fairly
puzzled
it
was
a
stupendously
clever
dodge
higginson
must
have
trained
up
his
sister
for
forty
years
in
the
ways
of
wickedness
yet
held
her
in
reserve
for
this
supreme
moment
where
is
higginson
i
asked
lady
georgina
broke
into
a
hysterical
laugh
is
he
my
dear
that
the
question
with
consummate
strategy
the
wretch
has
disappeared
into
space
at
the
last
moment
artful
again
i
said
presence
could
only
damage
their
case
i
can
see
of
course
lord
southminster
has
no
need
of
him
the
wiliest
fool
that
ever
lived
harold
broke
out
bitterly
that
mask
of
imbecility
he
a
fox
for
trickiness
i
bit
my
lip
if
you
succeed
in
evading
him
i
said
will
have
cleared
your
character
and
if
you
do
then
harold
our
time
will
have
come
you
will
have
your
chance
of
trying
me
wo
do
me
much
good
he
answered
i
have
to
wait
fourteen
years
for
you
at
portland
illustration
the
begged
him
to
be
very
careful
next
morning
in
court
i
heard
harold
he
described
exactly
where
he
had
found
the
contested
will
in
his
uncle
escritoire
the
a
heavy
man
with
bloated
features
and
a
bulbous
nose
begged
him
with
one
fat
uplifted
forefinger
to
be
very
careful
how
did
he
know
where
to
look
for
it
i
knew
the
house
well
i
knew
where
my
uncle
was
likely
to
keep
his
valuables
indeed
because
you
had
put
it
there
the
court
rang
with
laughter
my
face
grew
crimson
after
an
hour
or
two
of
fencing
harold
was
dismissed
he
stood
down
baffled
counsel
recalled
lord
southminster
the
young
man
stepping
briskly
up
gazed
about
him
with
a
vacant
stare
the
look
of
cunning
on
his
face
was
carefully
suppressed
he
wore
on
the
contrary
an
air
of
injured
innocence
combined
with
an
did
not
put
this
will
in
the
drawer
where
tillington
found
it
did
you
counsel
asked
the
young
man
laughed
i
certainly
did
put
it
theah
my
cousin
harold
was
man
in
possession
he
took
jolly
good
care
did
come
neah
the
premises
you
think
you
could
forge
a
will
if
you
tried
lord
southminster
laughed
i
do
he
answered
with
a
just
the
difference
between
us
yah
know
what
they
call
a
fool
and
my
cousin
harold
a
precious
clevah
fellah
there
was
another
loud
laugh
not
evidence
the
judge
observed
severely
it
was
not
but
it
told
far
more
than
much
that
was
it
told
strongly
against
harold
lord
southminster
continued
with
engaging
frankness
i
forged
a
will
at
all
i
take
jolly
good
care
to
forge
it
in
my
own
favah
my
turn
came
next
our
counsel
handed
me
the
incriminated
will
you
draw
up
this
document
he
asked
i
looked
at
it
closely
the
paper
bore
our
florentine
and
was
written
with
a
it
i
answered
gazing
at
it
with
care
to
make
sure
i
recognised
it
our
counsel
business
was
to
uphold
the
will
not
to
cast
aspersions
upon
it
he
was
evidently
annoyed
at
my
close
examination
have
no
doubts
about
it
he
said
trying
to
prompt
me
i
hesitated
no
doubts
i
answered
turning
over
the
sheet
and
inspecting
it
still
closer
it
at
florence
you
recognise
that
signature
as
marmaduke
ashurst
he
went
on
i
stared
at
it
was
it
his
it
was
like
it
certainly
yet
that
and
those
i
almost
wondered
counsel
was
obviously
annoyed
at
my
hesitation
he
thought
i
was
playing
into
the
enemy
hands
it
his
or
is
it
not
he
inquired
again
testily
is
his
i
answered
yet
i
own
i
was
troubled
illustration
i
was
a
grotesque
failure
he
asked
many
questions
about
the
circumstances
of
the
interview
when
i
took
down
the
will
i
answered
them
all
but
i
vaguely
felt
he
and
i
were
at
i
grew
almost
as
uncomfortable
under
his
gaze
as
if
he
had
been
examining
me
in
the
interest
of
the
other
side
he
managed
to
fluster
me
as
a
witness
for
harold
i
was
a
grotesque
failure
then
the
rising
and
shaking
his
huge
bulk
began
to
me
did
you
this
thing
do
you
say
he
said
pointing
to
it
contemptuously
my
office
at
florence
i
understand
you
had
an
office
in
florence
after
you
gave
up
retailing
bicycles
on
the
public
roads
and
you
had
a
partner
i
think
a
miss
petherick
or
petherton
or
pennyfarthing
or
something
petheridge
i
corrected
while
the
court
tittered
petheridge
you
call
it
well
now
answer
this
question
carefully
did
your
miss
petheridge
hear
ashurst
dictate
the
terms
of
his
last
will
and
testament
i
answered
interview
was
of
a
strictly
confidential
character
ashurst
took
me
aside
into
the
back
room
at
our
office
he
took
you
aside
confidential
well
now
we
getting
at
it
and
did
anybody
but
yourself
see
or
hear
any
part
whatsoever
of
this
precious
document
not
i
replied
was
a
private
matter
oh
very
nobody
else
saw
it
did
ashurst
take
it
away
from
the
office
in
person
he
sent
his
courier
for
it
courier
the
man
higginson
but
i
refused
to
give
it
to
higginson
i
took
it
myself
that
night
to
the
hotel
where
ashurst
was
stopping
you
took
it
yourself
so
the
only
other
person
who
knows
anything
at
first
hand
about
the
existence
of
the
alleged
will
is
this
person
higginson
petheridge
knows
i
said
flushing
the
time
i
told
her
of
it
told
her
well
that
does
help
us
much
if
what
you
are
swearing
is
true
remember
you
are
on
your
oath
what
you
told
miss
petherick
or
petheridge
or
pennyfarthing
at
the
time
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
corroborative
evidence
your
word
then
and
your
word
now
are
just
equally
valuable
or
equally
worthless
the
only
person
who
knows
besides
yourself
is
higginson
now
i
ask
you
is
higginson
you
going
to
produce
him
the
wicked
cunning
of
it
struck
me
dumb
they
were
keeping
him
away
and
then
using
his
absence
to
cast
doubts
on
my
veracity
i
cried
taken
aback
is
well
known
to
be
a
rogue
and
he
is
keeping
away
lest
he
may
damage
your
side
i
know
nothing
of
higginson
i
coming
to
that
in
good
time
do
be
afraid
that
we
going
to
pass
over
higginson
you
admit
this
man
is
a
man
of
bad
character
now
what
do
you
know
of
him
i
told
the
stories
of
the
count
and
of
the
leant
across
towards
me
and
leered
this
is
the
man
he
exclaimed
with
a
triumphant
air
sister
you
pretended
you
had
got
to
sign
this
precious
document
of
yours
ashurst
got
to
sign
it
i
answered
is
not
document
you
have
heard
that
she
swears
it
is
not
her
signature
at
all
they
tell
me
she
is
higginson
sister
for
all
i
know
she
may
be
prepared
to
swear
or
to
forswear
anything
cast
doubt
upon
our
witnesses
without
cause
miss
higginson
is
an
eminently
respectable
woman
you
gave
this
document
to
ashurst
you
say
there
your
knowledge
of
it
ends
a
signature
is
placed
on
it
which
is
not
his
as
our
experts
testify
it
purports
to
be
witnessed
by
a
swiss
waiter
who
is
not
forthcoming
and
who
is
asserted
to
be
dead
as
well
as
by
a
nurse
who
denies
her
signature
and
the
only
other
person
who
knows
of
its
existence
before
tillington
discovers
it
in
his
uncle
desk
is
the
missing
man
higginson
is
that
or
is
it
not
the
truth
of
the
matter
suppose
so
i
said
baffled
now
as
to
this
man
higginson
he
first
appears
upon
the
scene
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
on
the
day
when
you
travelled
from
london
to
schlangenbad
is
so
i
answered
he
nearly
succeeded
then
in
stealing
lady
georgina
nearly
took
it
but
i
saved
it
and
i
explained
the
circumstance
the
held
his
fat
sides
with
his
hands
looking
incredulously
at
me
and
smiled
his
vast
width
of
waistcoat
shook
with
silent
merriment
are
a
very
clever
young
lady
he
murmured
can
explain
away
anything
but
do
you
think
it
just
as
likely
that
it
was
a
plot
between
you
two
and
that
owing
to
some
mistake
the
plot
came
off
unsuccessful
do
not
i
cried
crimson
never
saw
the
count
before
that
morning
he
tried
another
tack
wherever
you
went
this
man
higginson
the
only
other
person
you
admit
who
knows
about
the
previous
existence
of
the
will
turned
up
simultaneously
he
was
always
turning
up
at
the
same
place
as
you
did
he
turned
up
at
lucerne
as
a
did
he
you
will
allow
me
to
explain
i
cried
biting
my
lip
he
bowed
all
blandness
certainly
he
murmured
away
everything
i
explained
but
of
course
he
had
discounted
and
damaged
my
explanation
he
made
no
comment
then
he
went
on
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
his
obtrusive
rotundity
turned
up
at
florence
as
courier
to
ashurst
at
the
very
date
when
this
will
was
being
concocted
was
at
florence
when
ashurst
dictated
it
to
me
i
answered
growing
desperate
admit
he
was
in
florence
good
once
more
he
turned
up
in
india
with
my
client
lord
southminster
upon
whose
youth
and
inexperience
he
had
managed
to
impose
himself
and
he
carried
him
off
did
he
not
by
one
of
these
strange
coincidences
to
which
are
peculiarly
liable
on
the
very
same
steamer
on
which
happened
to
be
travelling
southminster
told
me
he
took
higginson
with
him
because
a
rogue
suited
his
book
i
answered
warmly
you
swear
his
lordship
did
say
rogue
suited
his
book
which
is
quite
another
thing
the
asked
blandly
will
swear
he
did
not
i
replied
have
correctly
reported
him
i
congratulate
you
young
lady
on
your
excellent
memory
my
lud
will
you
allow
me
later
to
recall
lord
southminster
to
testify
on
this
point
the
judge
nodded
once
more
as
to
your
relations
with
the
various
members
of
the
ashurst
family
you
introduced
yourself
to
lady
georgina
fawley
i
believe
quite
casually
on
a
seat
in
kensington
gardens
is
true
i
answered
had
never
seen
her
before
you
promptly
offered
to
go
with
her
as
her
lady
maid
to
schlangenbad
in
germany
place
of
her
lady
maid
for
one
week
i
answered
a
delicate
distinction
in
place
of
her
lady
maid
you
are
a
lady
i
believe
an
officer
daughter
you
told
us
educated
at
girton
i
have
said
already
i
replied
crimson
you
stick
to
it
by
all
means
tell
the
truth
and
stick
to
it
it
always
safest
now
do
you
think
it
was
rather
an
odd
thing
for
an
officer
daughter
to
do
to
run
about
germany
as
maid
to
a
lady
of
title
illustration
the
jury
smiled
i
tried
to
explain
once
more
but
the
jury
smiled
you
ca
justify
originality
to
a
british
jury
why
they
would
send
you
to
prison
at
once
for
that
alone
if
they
made
the
laws
as
well
as
dispensing
them
he
passed
on
after
a
while
to
another
topic
think
you
have
boasted
more
than
once
in
society
that
when
you
first
met
lady
georgina
fawley
you
had
twopence
in
your
pocket
to
go
round
the
world
with
had
i
answered
i
went
round
the
world
with
it
i
getting
there
in
time
with
it
and
other
things
a
few
months
later
more
or
less
you
were
touring
up
the
nile
in
your
steam
dahabeeah
and
in
the
lap
of
luxury
you
were
taking
on
indian
railways
were
you
i
explained
again
dahabeeah
was
in
the
service
of
the
i
answered
became
a
journalist
he
me
about
that
i
am
to
understand
he
said
at
last
leaning
forward
with
all
his
waistcoat
you
sprang
yourself
upon
elworthy
at
sight
pretty
much
as
you
sprang
yourself
upon
lady
georgina
fawley
arranged
matters
quickly
i
admitted
the
dexterous
wretch
was
making
my
strongest
points
all
tell
against
me
well
he
was
a
man
and
you
will
admit
i
suppose
fingering
his
smooth
fat
chin
you
are
a
lady
of
what
is
the
stock
phrase
the
reporters
use
considerable
personal
attractions
lord
i
said
turning
to
the
bench
appeal
to
you
has
he
the
right
to
compel
me
to
answer
that
question
illustration
the
question
requires
no
answer
he
said
the
judge
bowed
slightly
question
requires
no
answer
he
said
with
a
quiet
emphasis
i
burned
bright
scarlet
my
lud
i
defer
to
your
ruling
the
continued
radiant
go
on
to
another
point
when
in
india
i
believe
you
stopped
for
some
time
as
a
guest
in
the
house
of
a
native
maharajah
that
matter
relevant
the
judge
asked
sharply
lud
the
said
in
his
blandest
voice
am
striving
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
this
lady
the
only
person
who
ever
beheld
this
will
till
harold
tillington
described
in
its
terms
as
younger
of
gledcliffe
whatever
that
may
be
produced
it
out
of
his
uncle
desk
i
am
striving
to
suggest
that
this
lady
is
my
duty
to
my
client
compels
me
to
say
an
adventuress
he
had
uttered
the
word
i
felt
my
character
had
not
a
leg
left
to
stand
upon
before
a
british
jury
went
there
with
my
friend
miss
petheridge
i
began
miss
petheridge
once
more
you
hunt
in
couples
and
chaperoned
by
a
married
lady
the
wife
of
a
major
balmossie
on
the
bombay
staff
corps
was
certainly
prudent
one
ought
to
be
chaperoned
can
you
produce
the
lady
is
it
possible
i
cried
balmossie
is
in
india
but
the
maharajah
i
understand
is
in
london
is
true
i
answered
he
came
to
meet
you
on
your
arrival
yesterday
lady
georgina
fawley
i
cried
taken
off
my
guard
you
not
consider
it
curious
he
asked
these
higginsons
and
these
maharajahs
should
happen
to
follow
you
so
closely
round
the
world
should
happen
to
turn
up
wherever
you
do
came
to
be
present
at
this
trial
i
exclaimed
so
did
you
i
believe
he
met
you
at
euston
last
night
and
drove
you
to
your
hotel
in
his
private
carriage
lady
georgina
fawley
i
answered
once
more
lady
georgina
is
on
tillington
side
i
fancy
ah
yes
i
thought
so
and
tillington
also
called
to
see
you
and
likewise
miss
petherick
i
beg
your
pardon
petheridge
we
must
be
strictly
accurate
where
miss
petheridge
is
concerned
and
in
fact
you
had
quite
a
little
family
party
friends
were
glad
to
see
me
back
again
i
murmured
he
sprang
a
fresh
innuendo
tillington
did
not
resent
your
visit
to
this
gallant
maharajah
not
i
cried
bridling
should
he
we
getting
to
that
too
now
answer
me
this
carefully
we
want
to
find
out
what
interest
you
might
have
supposing
a
will
were
forged
on
either
side
in
arranging
its
terms
we
want
to
find
out
just
who
would
benefit
by
it
please
reply
to
this
question
yes
or
no
without
prevarication
are
you
or
are
you
not
conditionally
engaged
to
harold
tillington
i
might
explain
i
began
quivering
he
sneered
have
a
genius
for
explaining
we
are
aware
answer
me
first
yes
or
no
we
will
qualify
afterward
i
glanced
appealingly
at
the
judge
he
was
adamant
as
counsel
directs
you
witness
he
said
sternly
i
am
i
faltered
me
one
moment
you
promised
to
marry
him
conditionally
upon
the
result
of
ashurst
testamentary
dispositions
did
i
answered
my
explanation
was
drowned
in
roars
of
laughter
in
which
the
judge
joined
in
spite
of
himself
when
the
mirth
in
court
had
subsided
a
little
i
went
on
told
tillington
i
would
only
marry
him
in
case
he
was
poor
and
without
expectations
if
he
inherited
marmaduke
ashurst
money
i
could
never
be
his
wife
i
said
it
proudly
the
drew
himself
up
and
let
his
rotundity
take
care
of
itself
you
take
me
he
inquired
one
of
her
there
was
another
roar
of
laughter
feebly
suppressed
by
a
judicial
frown
and
i
slank
away
annihilated
can
go
my
persecutor
said
think
we
have
got
well
everything
we
wanted
from
you
you
promised
to
marry
him
if
all
went
ill
that
is
a
delicate
feminine
way
of
putting
it
women
like
these
equivocations
they
relieve
one
from
the
onus
of
speaking
frankly
i
stood
down
from
the
box
feeling
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
conscious
of
having
scored
an
ignominious
failure
our
counsel
did
not
care
to
me
i
recognised
that
it
would
be
useless
the
hateful
had
put
all
my
history
in
such
an
odious
light
that
explanation
could
only
make
matters
worse
it
must
savour
of
apology
the
jury
could
never
understand
my
point
of
view
it
could
never
be
made
to
see
that
there
are
adventuresses
and
adventuresses
then
came
the
final
speeches
on
either
side
harold
advocate
said
the
best
he
could
in
favour
of
the
will
our
party
propounded
but
his
best
was
bad
and
what
galled
me
most
was
this
i
could
see
he
himself
did
not
believe
in
its
genuineness
his
speech
amounted
to
little
more
than
a
perfunctory
attempt
to
put
the
most
favourable
face
on
a
probable
forgery
as
for
the
he
rose
to
reply
with
humorous
confidence
swaying
his
big
body
to
and
fro
he
crumpled
our
will
and
our
case
in
his
fat
fingers
like
so
much
flimsy
ashurst
had
made
a
disposition
of
his
property
twenty
years
ago
the
right
disposition
the
natural
disposition
he
had
left
the
bulk
of
it
as
childless
english
gentlemen
have
ever
been
wont
to
leave
their
wealth
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
eldest
son
of
his
family
the
honourable
marmaduke
courtney
ashurst
the
testator
was
the
scion
of
a
great
house
which
recent
agricultural
changes
he
regretted
to
say
had
relatively
impoverished
he
had
come
to
the
succour
of
that
great
house
as
such
a
scion
should
with
his
property
acquired
by
honest
industry
elsewhere
it
was
fitting
and
reasonable
that
ashurst
should
wish
to
see
the
kynaston
peerage
regain
in
the
person
of
the
amiable
and
accomplished
young
nobleman
whom
he
had
the
honour
to
represent
some
portion
of
its
ancient
dignity
and
splendour
but
jealousy
and
greed
intervened
here
he
frowned
at
harold
harold
tillington
the
son
of
one
of
ashurst
married
sisters
cast
longing
eyes
as
he
had
tried
to
suggest
to
them
on
his
cousin
lord
southminster
natural
heritage
the
result
he
feared
was
an
unnatural
intrigue
harold
tillington
formed
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
lady
should
we
say
young
lady
he
withered
me
with
his
glance
well
yes
a
lady
indeed
by
birth
and
education
but
an
adventuress
by
choice
a
lady
who
brought
up
in
a
respectable
though
not
he
must
admit
a
distinguished
sphere
had
lowered
herself
by
accepting
the
position
of
a
lady
maid
and
had
trafficked
in
patent
american
cycles
on
the
public
of
germany
and
switzerland
this
clever
and
designing
woman
he
would
grant
her
ability
he
would
grant
her
good
looks
had
fascinated
tillington
that
was
the
theory
he
ventured
to
lay
before
the
jury
and
the
jury
would
see
for
themselves
that
whatever
else
the
young
lady
might
be
she
had
distinctly
a
certain
outer
gift
of
fascination
it
was
for
them
to
decide
whether
miss
lois
cayley
had
or
had
not
suggested
to
harold
tillington
the
design
of
substituting
a
forged
will
for
marmaduke
ashurst
undeniable
testament
he
would
point
out
to
them
her
singular
connection
with
the
missing
man
higginson
whom
the
young
lady
herself
described
as
a
rogue
and
from
whom
she
had
done
her
very
best
to
dissociate
herself
in
this
court
but
ineffectually
wherever
miss
cayley
went
the
man
higginson
went
independently
such
frequent
recurrences
such
apt
juxtapositions
could
hardly
be
set
down
to
mere
accidental
coincidence
he
went
on
to
insinuate
that
higginson
and
i
had
concocted
the
disputed
will
between
us
that
we
had
passed
it
on
to
our
harold
and
that
harold
had
forged
his
uncle
signature
to
it
and
had
appended
those
of
the
two
supposed
witnesses
but
who
now
were
these
witnesses
one
franz
markheim
was
dead
or
missing
dead
men
tell
no
tales
the
other
was
obviously
suggested
by
higginson
it
was
his
own
sister
perhaps
he
forged
her
name
to
the
document
doubtless
he
thought
that
family
feeling
would
induce
her
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
to
accept
and
endorse
her
brother
lie
nay
he
might
even
have
been
foolish
enough
to
suppose
that
this
will
would
not
be
disputed
if
so
he
and
his
master
had
reckoned
without
lord
southminster
a
gentleman
who
concealed
beneath
the
careless
exterior
of
a
man
of
fashion
the
solid
intelligence
of
a
man
of
affairs
and
the
hard
head
of
a
man
not
to
be
lightly
cheated
in
matters
of
business
the
alleged
will
had
thus
not
a
leg
to
stand
upon
it
was
save
the
mark
dictation
at
florence
by
whom
by
the
lady
who
had
most
to
gain
from
its
success
the
lady
who
was
to
be
transformed
from
a
shady
adventuress
tossed
about
between
irish
doctors
and
hindu
maharajahs
into
the
lawful
wife
of
a
wealthy
diplomatist
of
noble
family
on
one
condition
only
if
this
pretended
will
could
be
satisfactorily
established
the
signatures
were
forgeries
as
shown
by
the
expert
evidence
and
also
by
the
oath
of
the
one
surviving
witness
the
will
left
all
the
estate
practically
to
harold
tillington
and
five
hundred
pounds
to
whom
why
to
the
accomplice
higginson
the
minor
bequests
the
regarded
as
ingenious
inventions
pure
play
of
fancy
to
give
artistic
verisimilitude
as
says
in
the
opera
an
otherwise
bald
and
unconvincing
narrative
the
fads
it
was
true
were
known
fads
of
ashurst
but
what
sort
of
fads
bimetallism
no
braces
and
clearly
the
kind
that
would
best
be
known
to
a
courier
like
higginson
the
sole
begetter
he
believed
of
this
nefarious
conspiracy
the
lifting
his
fat
right
hand
in
solemn
adjuration
called
upon
the
jury
confidently
to
set
aside
this
ridiculous
fabrication
and
declare
for
a
will
of
undoubted
genuineness
a
will
drawn
up
in
london
by
a
firm
of
eminent
solicitors
and
preserved
ever
since
by
the
testator
bankers
it
would
then
be
for
his
lordship
to
decide
whether
in
the
public
interest
he
should
recommend
the
crown
to
prosecute
on
a
charge
of
forgery
the
clumsy
fabricator
of
this
preposterous
document
the
judge
summed
up
strongly
in
favour
of
lord
southminster
will
if
the
jury
believed
the
experts
and
miss
higginson
one
verdict
alone
was
possible
the
jury
retired
for
three
minutes
only
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
they
found
for
lord
southminster
the
judge
looking
grave
concurred
in
their
finding
a
most
proper
verdict
and
he
considered
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
public
prosecutor
to
pursue
harold
tillington
on
the
charge
of
forgery
illustration
i
reeled
where
i
sat
i
reeled
where
i
sat
then
i
looked
round
for
harold
he
had
slipped
from
the
court
unseen
during
counsel
address
some
minutes
earlier
that
distressed
me
more
than
anything
else
on
that
dreadful
day
i
wished
he
had
stood
up
in
his
place
like
a
man
to
face
this
vile
and
cruel
conspiracy
i
walked
out
slowly
supported
by
lady
georgina
who
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
herself
but
very
straight
and
scornful
always
knew
southminster
was
a
fool
she
said
aloud
always
knew
he
was
a
sneak
but
i
did
not
know
till
now
he
was
also
a
particularly
bad
type
of
criminal
on
the
steps
of
the
court
the
young
man
met
us
his
air
was
jaunty
i
was
right
yah
see
he
said
smiling
and
withdrawing
his
cigarette
backed
the
wrong
fellah
i
told
you
i
win
i
say
moah
now
this
is
not
the
time
or
place
to
recur
to
that
subject
but
you
come
round
you
think
bettah
of
it
still
you
back
the
winnah
i
wished
i
were
a
man
that
i
might
have
the
pleasure
of
kicking
him
we
drove
back
to
my
hotel
and
waited
for
harold
to
my
horror
and
alarm
he
never
came
near
us
i
might
almost
have
doubted
him
if
he
had
not
been
harold
i
waited
and
waited
he
did
not
come
at
all
he
sent
no
word
no
message
and
all
that
evening
we
heard
the
newsboys
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voice
in
the
street
speshul
the
ashurst
will
kise
sensational
developments
disappearance
of
tillington
xi
the
adventure
of
the
oriental
attendant
i
did
not
sleep
that
night
next
morning
i
rose
very
early
from
a
restless
bed
with
a
dry
hot
mouth
and
a
general
feeling
that
the
solid
earth
had
failed
beneath
me
still
no
news
from
harold
it
was
cruel
i
thought
my
faith
almost
flagged
he
was
a
man
and
should
be
brave
how
could
he
run
away
and
hide
himself
at
such
a
time
even
if
i
set
my
own
anxiety
aside
just
think
to
what
serious
misapprehension
it
laid
him
open
i
sent
out
for
the
morning
papers
they
were
full
of
harold
rumours
rumours
rumours
tillington
had
deliberately
chosen
to
put
himself
in
the
wrong
by
disappearing
mysteriously
at
the
last
moment
he
had
only
himself
to
blame
if
the
worst
interpretation
were
put
upon
his
action
but
the
police
were
on
his
track
scotland
yard
had
clue
it
was
confidently
expected
an
arrest
would
be
made
before
evening
at
latest
as
to
details
authorities
differed
the
officials
of
the
great
western
railway
at
paddington
were
convinced
that
tillington
had
started
alone
and
undisguised
by
the
night
express
for
exeter
the
inspectors
at
charing
cross
on
the
other
hand
were
equally
certain
that
he
had
slipped
away
with
a
false
beard
in
company
with
his
higginson
by
the
to
paris
everybody
took
it
for
granted
however
that
he
had
left
london
conjecture
played
with
various
ultimate
destinations
spain
morocco
sicily
the
argentine
in
italy
said
the
he
might
lurk
for
a
while
he
spoke
italian
fluently
and
could
manage
to
put
up
at
tiny
in
places
seldom
visited
by
englishmen
he
might
try
albania
said
the
airing
its
exclusive
information
he
had
often
hunted
there
and
might
in
turn
be
hunted
he
would
probably
attempt
to
slink
away
to
some
remote
spot
in
the
carpathians
or
the
balkans
said
the
quite
proud
of
its
geography
still
wherever
he
went
justice
in
this
age
said
the
must
surely
overtake
him
the
day
of
universal
extradition
had
dawned
we
had
no
more
alsatias
even
the
argentine
itself
gives
up
its
rogues
at
last
not
an
asylum
for
crime
remains
in
europe
not
a
refuge
in
asia
africa
america
australia
or
the
pacific
islands
i
noted
with
a
shudder
of
horror
that
all
the
papers
alike
took
his
guilt
as
certain
in
spite
of
a
few
decent
pretences
at
not
prejudging
an
untried
cause
they
treated
him
already
as
the
detected
criminal
the
fugitive
from
justice
i
sat
in
my
little
at
the
hotel
in
jermyn
street
a
limp
rag
looking
idly
out
of
the
window
with
swimming
eyes
and
waiting
for
lady
georgina
it
was
early
too
early
but
oh
why
did
she
come
unless
soon
sympathised
with
me
my
heart
would
break
under
this
load
of
loneliness
presently
as
i
looked
out
on
the
sloppy
morning
street
i
was
vaguely
aware
through
the
mist
that
floated
before
my
dry
eyes
for
tears
were
denied
me
of
a
very
grand
carriage
driving
up
to
the
doorway
the
porch
with
the
four
wooden
ionic
pillars
i
took
no
heed
of
it
i
was
too
for
observation
my
life
was
wrecked
and
harold
with
it
yet
dimly
through
the
mist
i
became
conscious
after
a
while
that
the
carriage
was
that
of
an
indian
prince
i
could
see
the
black
faces
the
white
turbans
the
gold
brocades
of
the
attendants
in
the
dickey
then
it
came
home
to
me
with
a
pang
that
this
was
the
maharajah
it
was
kindly
meant
yet
after
all
that
had
been
insinuated
in
court
the
day
before
i
was
by
no
means
that
his
dusky
highness
should
come
to
call
upon
me
walls
have
eyes
and
ears
reporters
were
hanging
about
all
over
london
eager
to
distinguish
themselves
by
successful
eavesdropping
they
would
note
with
brisk
innuendoes
after
their
kind
how
maharajah
of
moozuffernuggar
called
early
in
the
day
on
miss
lois
cayley
with
whom
he
remained
for
at
least
half
an
hour
in
close
consultation
i
had
half
a
mind
to
send
down
a
message
that
i
could
not
see
him
my
face
still
burned
with
the
undeserved
shame
of
the
unspeakable
suggestions
before
i
could
make
my
mind
up
however
i
saw
to
my
surprise
that
the
maharajah
did
not
propose
to
come
in
himself
he
leaned
back
in
his
place
with
his
lordly
eastern
air
and
waited
looking
down
on
the
gapers
in
the
street
while
one
of
the
two
gorgeous
attendants
in
the
dickey
descended
obsequiously
to
receive
his
orders
the
man
was
dressed
as
usual
in
rich
oriental
stuffs
and
wore
his
full
white
turban
swathed
in
folds
round
his
head
i
could
not
see
his
features
he
bent
forward
respectfully
with
oriental
suppleness
to
take
his
highness
orders
then
receiving
a
card
and
bowing
low
he
entered
the
porch
with
the
wooden
ionic
pillars
and
disappeared
within
while
the
maharajah
folded
his
hands
and
seemed
to
resign
himself
to
a
temporary
nirvana
illustration
the
messenger
entered
a
minute
later
a
knock
sounded
on
my
door
in
i
said
faintly
and
the
messenger
entered
i
turned
and
faced
him
the
blood
rushed
to
my
cheek
i
cried
darting
forward
my
joy
overcame
me
he
folded
me
in
his
arms
i
allowed
him
unreproved
for
the
first
time
he
kissed
me
i
did
not
shrink
from
it
then
i
stood
away
a
little
and
gazed
at
him
even
at
that
crucial
moment
of
doubt
and
fear
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
admirably
he
made
up
as
a
handsome
young
rajput
three
years
earlier
at
schlangenbad
i
remembered
he
had
struck
me
as
strangely
he
had
the
features
of
a
indian
gentleman
without
the
complexion
his
large
poetical
eyes
his
regular
oval
face
his
even
teeth
his
mouth
and
moustache
all
vaguely
recalled
the
highest
type
of
the
eastern
temperament
now
he
had
blackened
his
face
and
hands
with
some
permanent
stain
indian
ink
i
learned
later
and
the
resemblance
to
a
rajput
chief
was
positively
startling
in
his
gold
brocade
and
ample
white
turban
no
i
felt
sure
would
ever
have
dreamt
of
doubting
him
you
knew
me
at
once
he
said
holding
my
face
between
his
hands
bad
darling
i
flattered
myself
i
had
transformed
my
face
into
the
complete
indian
has
sharp
eyes
i
answered
can
see
through
brick
walls
but
the
disguise
is
perfect
no
one
else
would
detect
you
is
blind
i
thought
where
it
ought
to
see
there
it
pierces
everything
i
knew
you
instantly
harold
but
all
london
i
am
sure
would
pass
you
by
unknown
you
are
absolute
orient
well
for
all
london
is
looking
for
me
he
answered
bitterly
streets
bristle
with
detectives
southminster
knaveries
have
won
the
day
so
i
have
tried
this
disguise
otherwise
i
should
have
been
arrested
the
moment
the
jury
brought
in
their
verdict
why
were
you
not
i
asked
drawing
back
harold
i
trust
you
but
why
did
you
disappear
and
make
all
the
world
believe
you
admitted
yourself
guilty
he
opened
his
arms
you
guess
he
cried
holding
them
out
to
me
i
nestled
in
them
once
more
but
i
answered
through
my
tears
i
had
found
tears
now
harold
it
baffles
me
remember
what
you
promised
me
he
murmured
leaning
over
me
and
clasping
me
ever
i
were
poor
friendless
hunted
you
would
marry
me
now
the
opportunity
has
come
when
we
can
both
prove
ourselves
except
you
and
dear
georgey
i
have
a
friend
in
the
world
everyone
else
has
turned
against
me
southminster
holds
the
field
i
am
a
suspected
forger
in
a
very
few
days
i
shall
doubtless
be
a
convicted
felon
unjustly
as
you
know
yet
still
we
must
face
it
a
convicted
felon
so
i
have
come
to
claim
you
i
have
come
to
ask
you
now
in
this
moment
of
despair
will
you
keep
your
promise
i
lifted
my
face
to
his
he
bent
over
it
trembling
i
whispered
the
words
in
his
ear
harold
i
will
keep
it
i
have
always
loved
you
and
now
i
will
marry
you
knew
you
would
he
cried
and
pressed
me
to
his
bosom
we
sat
for
some
minutes
holding
each
other
hands
and
saying
nothing
we
were
too
full
of
thought
for
words
then
suddenly
harold
roused
himself
must
make
haste
darling
he
cried
are
keeping
partab
outside
and
every
minute
is
precious
every
minute
delay
dangerous
we
ought
to
go
down
at
once
partab
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
door
for
us
down
i
exclaimed
clinging
to
him
why
i
do
understand
what
is
your
programme
i
forgot
i
had
explained
to
you
listen
here
dearest
quick
i
can
waste
no
words
over
it
i
said
just
now
i
had
no
friends
in
the
world
but
you
and
georgey
that
not
true
for
dear
old
partab
has
stuck
to
me
nobly
when
all
my
english
friends
fell
away
the
rajput
was
true
to
me
he
arranged
all
this
it
was
his
own
idea
he
foresaw
what
was
coming
he
urged
me
yesterday
just
before
the
verdict
when
he
saw
my
acquaintances
beginning
to
look
askance
to
slip
quietly
out
of
court
and
make
my
way
by
unobtrusive
roads
to
his
house
in
curzon
street
there
he
darkened
my
face
like
his
and
converted
me
to
hinduism
i
do
suppose
the
disguise
will
serve
me
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
but
it
will
last
long
enough
for
us
to
get
safely
away
to
scotland
i
murmured
you
mean
to
try
a
scotch
marriage
is
the
only
thing
possible
we
must
be
married
and
in
england
of
course
we
can
not
do
it
we
would
have
to
be
called
in
church
or
else
to
procure
a
license
either
of
which
would
involve
disclosure
of
my
identity
besides
even
the
license
would
keep
us
waiting
about
for
a
day
or
two
in
scotland
on
the
other
hand
we
can
be
married
at
once
partab
carriage
is
below
to
take
you
to
cross
he
is
staunch
as
steel
dear
fellow
do
you
consent
to
go
with
me
my
faculty
for
promptly
making
up
such
mind
as
i
possess
stood
me
once
more
in
good
stead
i
answered
harold
this
calamity
has
its
happy
side
for
without
it
much
as
i
love
you
i
could
never
have
brought
myself
to
marry
you
moment
he
cried
you
go
recollect
this
step
is
irrevocable
you
will
marry
a
man
who
may
be
torn
from
you
this
evening
and
from
whom
fourteen
years
of
prison
may
separate
you
know
it
i
cried
through
my
tears
i
shall
be
showing
my
confidence
in
you
my
love
for
you
he
kissed
me
once
more
fervently
makes
amends
for
all
he
cried
to
have
won
such
a
woman
as
you
i
would
go
through
it
all
a
thousand
times
over
it
was
for
this
and
for
this
alone
that
i
hid
myself
last
night
i
wanted
to
give
you
the
chance
of
showing
me
how
much
how
truly
you
loved
me
after
we
are
married
i
asked
trembling
shall
give
myself
up
at
once
to
the
police
in
edinburgh
i
clung
to
him
wistfully
my
heart
half
urged
me
to
urge
him
to
escape
but
i
knew
that
was
wrong
yourself
up
then
i
said
sobbing
is
a
brave
man
place
you
must
stand
your
trial
and
come
what
will
i
will
strive
to
bear
it
with
you
knew
you
would
he
cried
was
not
mistaken
in
you
we
embraced
again
just
once
it
was
little
enough
after
those
years
of
waiting
come
he
cried
us
go
i
drew
back
with
you
dearest
i
whispered
in
the
maharajah
carriage
you
must
start
by
yourself
i
will
follow
you
at
once
to
king
cross
in
a
hansom
he
saw
i
was
right
it
would
avoid
suspicion
and
it
would
prevent
more
scandal
he
withdrew
without
a
word
meet
i
said
ten
at
king
cross
station
i
did
not
even
wait
to
wash
the
tears
from
my
eyes
all
red
as
they
were
i
put
on
my
hat
and
my
little
brown
travelling
jacket
i
think
i
so
much
as
glanced
once
at
the
glass
the
seconds
were
precious
i
saw
the
maharajah
drive
away
with
harold
in
the
dickey
arms
crossed
imperturbable
orientally
silent
he
looked
the
very
counterpart
of
the
rajput
by
his
side
then
i
descended
the
stairs
and
walked
out
boldly
as
i
passed
through
the
hall
the
servants
and
the
visitors
stared
at
me
and
whispered
they
spoke
with
nods
and
liftings
of
the
eyebrows
i
was
aware
that
that
morning
i
had
achieved
notoriety
at
piccadilly
circus
i
jumped
of
a
sudden
into
a
passing
hansom
cross
i
cried
as
i
mounted
the
step
quick
i
have
no
time
to
spare
and
as
the
man
drove
off
i
saw
by
a
convulsive
dart
of
someone
across
the
road
that
i
had
given
the
slip
to
a
disappointed
reporter
at
the
station
i
took
a
ticket
for
edinburgh
on
the
platform
the
maharajah
and
his
attendants
were
waiting
he
lifted
his
hat
to
me
though
otherwise
he
took
no
overt
notice
but
i
saw
his
keen
eyes
follow
me
down
the
train
harold
in
his
oriental
dress
pretended
not
to
observe
me
one
or
two
porters
and
a
few
curious
travellers
cast
inquiring
eyes
on
the
eastern
prince
and
made
remarks
about
him
to
one
another
the
chap
as
was
up
yesterday
in
the
ashurst
will
kise
said
one
lounger
to
his
neighbour
but
nobody
seemed
to
look
at
harold
his
subordinate
position
secured
him
from
curiosity
the
maharajah
had
always
two
eastern
servants
gorgeously
dressed
in
attendance
he
had
been
a
figure
in
london
society
and
at
lord
and
the
oval
for
two
or
three
seasons
fine
cricketer
one
porter
observed
to
his
mate
as
he
passed
not
so
dusty
for
a
nigger
the
other
man
replied
bowler
but
lord
he
ca
a
candle
to
good
old
ranji
as
for
myself
nobody
seemed
to
recognise
me
i
set
this
fact
down
to
the
fortunate
circumstance
that
the
evening
papers
had
published
rough
which
professed
to
be
my
portrait
and
which
naturally
led
the
public
to
look
out
for
a
termagant
i
took
my
seat
in
a
ladies
compartment
by
myself
as
the
train
was
about
to
start
harold
strolled
up
as
if
casually
for
a
moment
think
it
better
so
he
queried
without
moving
his
lips
or
seeming
to
look
at
me
i
answered
back
to
partab
do
come
near
me
again
till
we
get
to
edinburgh
it
is
dangerous
still
the
police
may
at
any
moment
hear
we
have
started
and
stop
us
and
now
that
we
have
once
committed
ourselves
to
this
plan
it
would
be
fatal
to
be
interrupted
before
we
have
got
married
are
right
he
cried
you
are
always
right
somehow
i
wished
i
could
think
so
myself
but
was
with
serious
misgivings
that
i
felt
the
train
roll
out
of
the
station
oh
that
long
journey
north
alone
in
a
ladies
compartment
with
the
feeling
that
harold
was
so
near
yet
so
unapproachable
it
was
an
endless
agony
had
the
maharajah
who
loved
and
admired
him
to
keep
him
from
brooding
but
i
left
alone
and
confined
with
my
own
fears
conjured
up
before
my
eyes
every
possible
misfortune
that
heaven
could
send
us
i
saw
clearly
now
that
if
we
failed
in
our
purpose
this
journey
would
be
taken
by
everyone
for
a
flight
and
would
deepen
the
suspicion
under
which
we
both
laboured
it
would
make
me
still
more
obviously
a
conspirator
with
harold
whatever
happened
we
must
strain
every
nerve
to
reach
scotland
in
safety
and
then
to
get
married
in
order
that
harold
might
immediately
surrender
himself
illustration
he
took
a
long
careless
stare
at
me
at
york
i
noticed
with
a
thrill
of
terror
that
a
man
in
plain
clothes
with
the
obtrusively
unobtrusive
air
of
a
detective
looked
carefully
though
casually
into
every
carriage
i
felt
sure
he
was
a
spy
because
of
his
marked
outer
jauntiness
of
demeanour
which
hardly
masked
an
underlying
expression
of
scrutiny
when
he
reached
my
place
he
took
a
long
careless
stare
at
me
a
seemingly
careless
stare
which
was
yet
of
the
keenest
observation
then
he
paced
slowly
along
the
line
of
carriages
with
a
glance
at
each
till
he
arrived
just
opposite
the
maharajah
compartment
there
he
stared
hard
once
more
the
maharajah
descended
so
did
harold
and
the
hindu
attendant
who
was
dressed
just
like
him
the
man
i
took
for
a
detective
indulged
in
a
frank
long
gaze
at
the
unconscious
indian
prince
but
cast
only
a
hasty
eye
on
the
two
apparent
followers
that
touch
of
revelation
relieved
my
mind
a
little
i
felt
convinced
the
police
were
watching
the
maharajah
and
myself
as
suspicious
persons
connected
with
the
case
but
they
had
not
yet
guessed
that
harold
had
disguised
himself
as
one
of
the
two
invariable
rajput
servants
we
steamed
on
northward
at
newcastle
the
same
detective
strolled
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
along
the
train
once
more
and
puffed
a
cigar
with
the
nonchalant
air
of
a
sporting
gentleman
but
i
was
certain
now
from
the
studious
unconcern
he
was
anxious
to
exhibit
that
he
must
be
a
spy
upon
us
he
overdid
his
mood
of
careless
observation
it
was
too
obvious
an
assumption
precisely
the
same
thing
happened
again
when
we
pulled
up
at
berwick
i
knew
now
that
we
were
watched
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
get
married
at
edinburgh
if
we
were
thus
closely
pursued
there
was
but
one
chance
open
we
must
leave
the
train
abruptly
at
the
first
scotch
stopping
station
the
detective
knew
we
were
booked
through
for
edinburgh
so
much
i
could
tell
because
i
saw
him
make
inquiries
of
the
ticket
examiner
at
york
and
again
at
berwick
and
because
the
thereupon
entered
a
mental
note
of
the
fact
as
he
punched
my
ticket
each
time
edinburgh
miss
all
right
and
then
stared
at
me
suspiciously
i
could
tell
he
had
heard
of
the
ashurst
will
case
he
also
lingered
long
about
the
maharajah
compartment
and
then
went
back
to
confer
with
the
detective
thus
putting
two
and
two
together
as
a
woman
will
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
spy
did
not
expect
us
to
leave
the
train
before
we
reached
edinburgh
that
told
in
our
favour
most
men
trust
much
to
just
such
vague
expectations
they
form
a
theory
and
then
neglect
the
adverse
chances
you
can
only
get
the
better
of
a
skilled
detective
by
taking
him
thus
psychologically
and
humanly
by
this
time
i
confess
i
felt
almost
like
a
criminal
never
in
my
life
had
danger
loomed
so
near
not
even
when
we
returned
with
the
arabs
from
the
oasis
for
then
we
feared
for
our
lives
alone
now
we
feared
for
our
honour
i
drew
a
card
from
my
case
before
we
left
berwick
station
and
scribbled
a
few
hasty
words
on
it
in
german
are
watched
a
detective
if
we
run
through
to
edinburgh
we
shall
doubtless
be
arrested
or
at
least
impeded
this
train
will
stop
at
dunbar
for
one
minute
just
before
it
leaves
again
get
out
as
quietly
as
you
can
at
the
last
moment
i
will
also
get
out
and
join
you
let
partab
go
on
it
will
excite
less
attention
the
scheme
i
suggest
is
the
only
safe
plan
if
you
agree
as
soon
as
we
have
well
started
from
berwick
shake
your
handkerchief
unobtrusively
out
of
your
carriage
window
illustration
i
beckoned
a
porter
i
beckoned
a
porter
noiselessly
without
one
word
the
detective
was
now
strolling
along
the
of
the
train
with
his
back
turned
towards
me
peering
as
he
went
into
all
the
windows
i
gave
the
porter
a
shilling
this
to
a
black
gentleman
in
the
next
carriage
but
one
i
said
in
a
confidential
whisper
the
porter
touched
his
hat
nodded
smiled
and
took
it
would
harold
see
the
necessity
for
acting
on
my
advice
i
wondered
i
gazed
out
along
the
train
as
soon
as
we
had
got
well
clear
of
berwick
a
minute
two
minutes
three
minutes
passed
and
still
no
handkerchief
i
began
to
despair
he
was
debating
no
doubt
if
he
refused
all
was
lost
and
we
were
disgraced
for
ever
at
last
after
long
waiting
as
i
stared
still
along
the
whizzing
line
with
the
smoke
in
my
eyes
and
the
dust
half
blinding
me
i
saw
to
my
intense
relief
a
handkerchief
flutter
it
fluttered
once
not
markedly
then
a
black
hand
withdrew
it
only
just
in
time
for
even
as
it
disappeared
the
detective
head
thrust
itself
out
of
a
farther
window
he
was
not
looking
for
anything
in
particular
as
far
as
i
could
tell
just
observing
the
signals
but
it
gave
me
a
strange
thrill
to
think
even
now
we
were
so
nearly
defeated
my
next
trouble
was
would
the
train
draw
up
at
dunbar
the
from
king
cross
is
not
set
down
to
stop
there
in
bradshaw
for
no
passengers
are
booked
to
or
from
the
station
by
the
day
express
but
i
remembered
from
of
old
when
i
lived
at
edinburgh
that
it
used
always
to
wait
about
a
minute
for
some
purpose
this
doubt
filled
me
with
fresh
fear
did
it
draw
up
there
still
they
have
accelerated
the
service
so
much
of
late
years
and
abolished
so
many
old
accustomed
stoppages
i
counted
the
familiar
stations
with
my
breath
held
back
they
seemed
so
much
farther
apart
than
usual
reston
house
cockburnspath
innerwick
the
next
was
dunbar
if
we
rolled
past
then
all
was
lost
we
could
never
get
married
i
trembled
and
hugged
myself
the
engine
screamed
did
that
mean
she
was
running
through
oh
how
i
wished
i
had
learned
the
interpretation
of
the
signals
then
gradually
gently
we
began
to
slow
were
we
slowing
to
pass
the
station
only
no
with
a
jolt
she
drew
up
my
heart
gave
a
bound
as
i
read
the
word
on
the
station
i
rose
and
waited
with
my
fingers
on
the
door
happily
it
had
one
of
those
which
open
from
inside
no
need
to
betray
myself
prematurely
to
the
detective
by
a
hand
displayed
on
the
outer
handle
i
glanced
out
at
him
cautiously
his
head
was
thrust
through
his
window
and
his
sloping
shoulders
revealed
the
spy
but
he
was
looking
the
other
way
observing
the
signals
doubtless
to
discover
why
we
stopped
at
a
place
not
mentioned
in
bradshaw
harold
face
just
showed
from
another
window
close
by
too
soon
or
too
late
might
either
of
them
be
fatal
he
glanced
inquiry
at
me
i
nodded
back
the
train
gave
its
first
jerk
a
faint
backward
jerk
indicative
of
the
nascent
intention
of
starting
as
it
braced
itself
to
go
on
i
jumped
out
so
did
harold
we
faced
one
another
on
the
platform
without
a
word
away
there
the
cried
in
an
angry
voice
the
guard
waved
his
green
flag
the
detective
still
absorbed
on
the
signals
never
once
looked
back
one
second
later
we
were
safe
at
dunbar
and
he
was
speeding
away
by
the
express
for
edinburgh
it
gave
us
a
breathing
space
of
about
an
hour
illustration
you
ca
get
out
here
he
said
crustily
for
half
a
minute
i
could
not
speak
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
i
hardly
even
dared
to
look
at
harold
then
the
stalked
up
to
us
with
a
threatening
manner
ca
get
out
here
he
said
crustily
in
a
gruff
scotch
voice
train
is
not
timed
to
set
down
before
edinburgh
got
out
i
answered
taking
it
upon
me
to
speak
for
my
the
hindu
as
he
was
to
all
seeming
logic
of
facts
is
with
us
we
were
booked
through
to
edinburgh
but
we
wanted
to
stop
at
dunbar
and
as
the
train
happened
to
pull
up
we
thought
we
waste
time
by
going
on
all
that
way
and
then
coming
back
again
should
have
changed
at
berwick
the
said
still
gruffly
come
on
by
the
slow
train
i
could
see
his
careful
scotch
soul
was
vexed
incidentally
at
our
extravagance
in
paying
the
extra
fare
to
edinburgh
and
back
again
in
spite
of
agitation
i
managed
to
summon
up
one
of
my
sweetest
smiles
a
smile
that
ere
now
had
melted
the
hearts
of
rickshaw
coolies
and
of
french
he
thawed
before
it
visibly
was
important
to
us
i
said
oh
he
guessed
not
how
important
besides
you
know
it
is
so
good
for
the
company
true
he
answered
mollified
he
could
not
tilt
against
the
interests
of
the
north
british
shareholders
how
about
yer
luggage
it
have
gone
on
to
edinburgh
i
thinking
no
luggage
i
answered
boldly
he
stared
at
us
both
puckered
his
brow
a
moment
and
then
burst
out
laughing
ay
i
see
he
answered
with
a
comic
air
of
amusement
well
it
none
of
my
business
no
doubt
and
i
will
not
interfere
with
ye
though
why
a
lady
like
you
he
glanced
curiously
at
harold
i
saw
he
had
guessed
right
and
thought
it
best
to
throw
myself
unreservedly
on
his
mercy
time
was
indeed
important
i
glanced
at
the
station
clock
it
was
not
very
far
from
the
stroke
of
six
and
we
must
manage
to
get
married
before
the
detective
could
miss
us
at
edinburgh
where
he
was
due
at
so
i
smiled
once
more
that
smile
have
each
our
own
fancies
i
said
blushing
and
indeed
such
is
the
pride
of
race
among
women
i
felt
myself
blush
in
earnest
at
the
bare
idea
that
i
was
marrying
a
black
man
in
spite
of
our
good
maharajah
kindness
is
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
education
and
culture
i
thought
that
recommendation
ought
to
tell
with
a
scotchman
are
in
sore
straits
now
but
our
case
is
a
just
one
can
you
tell
me
who
in
this
place
is
most
likely
to
sympathise
most
likely
to
marry
us
he
looked
at
me
and
surrendered
at
discretion
should
think
anybody
would
marry
ye
who
saw
yer
pretty
face
and
heard
yer
sweet
voice
he
answered
perhaps
ye
better
present
yerself
to
schoolcraft
the
minister
at
little
kirkton
he
was
aye
far
from
here
i
asked
two
miles
he
answered
we
get
a
trap
ay
there
machines
always
waiting
at
the
station
illustration
we
told
our
tale
we
interviewed
a
and
drove
out
to
little
kirkton
there
we
told
our
tale
in
the
fewest
words
possible
to
the
obliging
and
minister
he
looked
as
the
had
said
but
he
dashed
our
hopes
to
the
ground
at
once
by
telling
us
candidly
that
unless
we
had
had
our
residence
in
scotland
for
days
immediately
preceding
the
marriage
it
would
not
be
legal
you
were
scotch
he
added
could
go
through
the
ceremony
at
once
of
course
and
then
you
could
apply
to
the
sheriff
for
leave
to
register
the
marriage
in
proper
form
afterward
but
as
one
of
you
is
english
and
the
other
i
judge
he
smiled
and
glanced
towards
harold
subject
of
her
majesty
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
do
it
the
ceremony
would
be
invalid
under
lord
act
without
previous
residence
this
was
a
terrible
blow
i
looked
away
appealingly
i
cried
in
despair
you
think
we
could
manage
to
hide
ourselves
safely
anywhere
in
scotland
for
days
his
face
fell
could
i
escape
notice
all
the
world
is
hunting
for
me
and
then
the
scandal
no
matter
where
you
stopped
however
far
from
me
no
lois
darling
i
could
never
expose
you
to
it
the
minister
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
puzzled
he
said
turning
over
the
word
on
his
tongue
that
does
sound
like
an
indian
name
does
it
and
he
hesitated
speak
wonderful
english
i
saw
the
safest
plan
was
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
looked
the
sort
of
man
one
could
trust
on
an
emergency
have
heard
of
the
ashurst
will
case
i
said
blurting
it
out
suddenly
have
seen
something
about
it
in
the
newspapers
yes
but
it
did
not
interest
me
i
have
not
followed
it
i
told
him
the
whole
truth
the
case
against
us
the
facts
as
we
knew
them
then
i
added
slowly
is
harold
tillington
whom
they
accuse
of
forgery
does
he
look
like
a
forger
i
want
to
marry
him
before
he
is
tried
it
is
the
only
way
by
which
i
can
prove
my
implicit
trust
in
him
as
soon
as
we
are
married
he
will
give
himself
up
at
once
to
the
police
if
you
wish
it
before
your
eyes
but
married
we
must
be
you
manage
it
somehow
my
pleading
voice
touched
him
tillington
he
murmured
know
of
his
forebears
lady
guinevere
tillington
son
is
it
not
then
you
must
be
younger
of
gledcliffe
for
scotland
is
a
village
everyone
in
it
seems
to
have
heard
of
every
other
does
he
mean
i
asked
of
gledcliffe
i
remembered
now
that
the
phrase
had
occurred
in
ashurst
will
though
i
never
understood
it
scotch
fashion
harold
answered
heir
to
a
laird
is
called
younger
of
my
father
has
a
small
estate
of
that
name
in
dumfriesshire
a
small
estate
i
was
born
and
brought
up
there
you
are
a
scotchman
the
minister
asked
harold
answered
frankly
remote
descent
we
are
trebly
of
the
female
line
at
gledcliffe
still
i
am
no
doubt
more
or
less
scotch
by
domicile
of
gledcliffe
oh
yes
that
ought
certainly
to
be
quite
sufficient
for
our
purpose
do
you
live
there
have
been
living
there
lately
i
always
live
there
when
i
in
britain
it
is
my
only
home
i
belong
to
the
diplomatic
service
then
the
lady
is
unmitigatedly
english
harold
admitted
in
a
gloomy
voice
quite
i
answered
lived
four
years
in
edinburgh
and
i
spent
my
holidays
there
while
i
was
at
girton
i
keep
my
boxes
still
at
my
old
rooms
in
maitland
street
that
will
do
the
minister
answered
quite
relieved
for
it
was
clear
that
our
anxiety
and
the
touch
of
romance
in
our
tale
had
enlisted
him
in
our
favour
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
it
suffices
for
the
act
if
one
only
of
the
parties
is
domiciled
in
scotland
and
as
tillington
lives
habitually
at
gledcliffe
that
settles
the
question
still
i
can
do
nothing
save
marry
you
now
by
religious
service
in
the
presence
of
my
servants
which
constitutes
what
we
call
an
ecclesiastical
marriage
it
becomes
legal
if
afterwards
registered
and
then
you
must
apply
to
the
sheriff
for
a
warrant
to
register
it
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
later
on
if
you
like
you
can
be
by
the
rites
of
your
own
church
in
england
you
quite
sure
our
scotch
domicile
is
good
enough
in
law
harold
asked
still
doubtful
can
turn
it
up
if
you
wish
i
have
a
legal
handbook
before
lord
brougham
act
no
formalities
were
necessary
but
the
act
was
passed
to
prevent
gretna
green
marriages
the
usual
phrase
is
that
such
a
marriage
does
not
hold
good
unless
one
or
other
of
the
parties
either
has
had
his
or
her
usual
residence
in
scotland
or
else
has
lived
there
for
days
immediately
preceding
the
date
of
the
marriage
if
you
like
i
will
wait
to
consult
the
authorities
thank
you
i
cried
is
no
time
to
lose
marry
us
first
and
look
it
up
afterwards
one
or
other
will
do
it
seems
tillington
is
scotch
enough
i
am
sure
he
has
no
address
in
britain
but
gledcliffe
we
will
rest
our
claim
upon
that
even
if
the
marriage
turns
out
invalid
we
only
remain
where
we
were
this
is
a
preliminary
ceremony
to
prove
good
faith
and
to
bind
us
to
one
another
we
can
satisfy
the
law
if
need
be
when
we
return
to
england
the
minister
called
in
his
wife
and
servants
and
explained
to
them
briefly
he
exhorted
us
and
prayed
we
gave
our
solemn
consent
in
legal
form
before
two
witnesses
then
he
pronounced
us
duly
married
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
more
we
had
made
declaration
to
that
effect
before
the
sheriff
the
witnesses
accompanying
us
and
were
formally
affirmed
to
be
man
and
wife
before
the
law
of
great
britain
i
asked
if
it
would
hold
in
england
as
well
could
be
firmer
married
the
sheriff
said
with
decision
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
in
westminster
abbey
harold
turned
to
the
minister
you
send
for
the
police
he
said
calmly
wish
to
inform
them
that
i
am
the
man
for
whom
they
are
looking
in
the
ashurst
will
case
our
own
cabman
went
to
fetch
them
it
was
a
terrible
moment
but
harold
sat
in
the
sheriff
study
and
waited
as
if
nothing
unusual
were
happening
he
talked
freely
but
quietly
never
in
my
life
had
i
felt
so
proud
of
him
at
last
the
police
came
much
inflated
with
the
dignity
of
so
great
a
capture
and
took
down
our
statement
you
give
yourself
in
charge
on
a
confession
of
forgery
the
superintendent
asked
as
harold
ended
not
harold
answered
have
not
committed
forgery
but
i
do
not
wish
to
skulk
or
hide
myself
i
understand
a
warrant
is
out
against
me
in
london
i
have
come
to
scotland
hurriedly
for
the
sake
of
getting
married
not
to
escape
apprehension
i
am
here
openly
under
my
own
name
i
tell
you
the
facts
is
for
you
to
decide
if
you
choose
you
can
arrest
me
the
superintendent
conferred
for
some
time
in
another
room
with
the
sheriff
then
he
returned
to
the
study
well
sir
he
said
in
a
respectful
tone
arrest
you
so
that
was
the
beginning
of
our
married
life
more
than
ever
i
felt
sure
i
could
trust
in
harold
the
police
decided
after
hearing
by
telegram
from
london
that
we
must
go
up
at
once
by
the
night
express
which
they
stopped
for
the
purpose
they
were
forced
to
divide
us
i
took
the
harold
travelled
with
two
constables
in
a
ordinary
carriage
strange
to
say
notwithstanding
all
this
so
great
was
our
relief
from
the
tension
of
our
flight
that
we
both
slept
soundly
next
morning
we
arrived
in
london
harold
guarded
the
police
had
arranged
that
the
case
should
come
up
at
bow
street
that
afternoon
it
was
not
an
ideal
honeymoon
and
yet
i
was
somehow
happy
at
king
cross
they
took
him
away
from
me
still
i
hardly
cried
all
the
way
up
in
the
train
whenever
i
was
awake
an
idea
had
been
haunting
me
a
possible
clue
to
this
trickery
of
lord
southminster
petty
details
cropped
up
and
fell
into
their
places
i
began
to
unravel
it
all
now
i
had
an
inkling
of
a
plan
to
set
harold
right
again
the
will
we
had
proved
but
i
must
not
anticipate
when
we
parted
harold
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
and
murmured
rather
sadly
i
suppose
it
all
up
lois
i
must
go
these
rogues
have
been
too
much
for
us
illustration
i
have
found
a
clue
a
bit
of
it
i
answered
new
hope
growing
stronger
and
stronger
within
me
see
a
way
out
i
have
found
a
clue
i
believe
dear
harold
the
right
will
still
be
vindicated
and
as
i
was
i
jumped
into
a
hansom
and
called
to
the
cabman
to
drive
at
once
to
lady
georgina
xii
the
adventure
of
the
unprofessional
detective
lady
georgina
at
home
the
discreet
in
sober
black
clothes
eyed
me
suspiciously
miss
he
answered
is
to
say
no
her
ladyship
is
still
at
marmaduke
ashurst
the
late
marmaduke
ashurst
i
mean
in
park
lane
north
you
know
the
number
i
know
it
i
replied
with
a
gasp
for
this
was
indeed
a
triumph
my
one
fear
had
been
lest
lord
southminster
should
already
have
taken
possession
why
you
will
see
hereafter
and
it
relieved
me
to
learn
that
lady
georgina
was
still
at
hand
to
guard
my
husband
interests
she
had
been
living
at
the
house
practically
since
her
death
i
drove
round
with
all
speed
and
flung
myself
into
my
dear
old
lady
arms
me
i
cried
flushed
am
your
niece
but
she
knew
it
already
for
our
movements
had
been
fully
reported
by
this
time
with
picturesque
additions
in
the
morning
papers
imagination
in
the
english
race
seems
to
concentrate
itself
in
the
lower
order
of
journalists
she
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
with
unwonted
tenderness
she
cried
with
tears
in
her
eyes
a
brick
it
was
not
exactly
poetical
at
such
a
moment
but
from
her
it
meant
more
than
much
gushing
phraseology
you
here
in
possession
i
murmured
illustration
i
held
the
fort
by
main
force
the
cantankerous
old
lady
nodded
she
was
in
her
element
i
must
admit
she
dearly
loved
a
row
above
all
a
family
row
but
to
be
in
the
thick
of
a
family
row
and
to
feel
herself
in
the
right
with
the
law
against
her
that
was
joy
such
as
lady
georgina
had
seldom
before
experienced
dear
she
burst
out
volubly
in
possession
thank
heaven
and
what
more
they
wo
oust
me
without
a
legal
process
i
been
here
off
and
on
you
know
ever
since
poor
dear
marmy
died
looking
after
things
for
harold
and
i
shall
look
after
them
still
till
bertie
southminster
succeeds
in
ejecting
me
which
wo
be
easy
oh
i
held
the
fort
by
main
force
i
can
tell
you
held
it
like
a
trojan
in
a
precious
great
hurry
to
move
in
i
can
see
but
i
wo
allow
him
he
been
down
here
this
morning
fatuously
blustering
and
trying
to
carry
the
post
by
storm
with
a
couple
of
policemen
i
cried
turn
you
out
my
dear
policemen
but
the
lord
be
praised
i
was
too
much
for
him
there
are
legal
formalities
to
fulfil
yet
and
i
wo
budge
an
inch
lois
not
one
inch
my
dear
till
he
fulfilled
every
one
of
them
mark
my
words
child
that
boy
up
to
some
devilry
is
i
answered
he
would
be
in
such
a
rampaging
hurry
to
get
in
being
as
lazy
as
he
takes
after
gwendoline
in
that
if
he
had
some
excellent
reason
for
wishing
to
take
possession
and
depend
upon
it
the
reason
is
that
he
wants
to
get
hold
of
something
or
other
harold
but
he
if
i
can
help
it
and
thank
my
stars
i
a
dour
woman
to
reckon
with
if
he
comes
he
comes
over
my
old
bones
child
i
been
overhauling
everything
of
marmy
i
can
tell
you
to
checkmate
the
boy
if
i
can
but
i
found
nothing
yet
and
till
satisfied
myself
on
that
point
i
hold
the
fort
still
if
i
have
to
barricade
that
scoundrel
of
a
nephew
of
mine
out
by
piling
the
furniture
against
the
front
door
i
will
as
sure
as
my
georgina
fawley
know
you
will
dear
i
assented
kissing
her
so
i
shall
venture
to
leave
you
while
i
go
out
to
institute
another
little
enquiry
enquiry
i
shook
my
head
only
a
surmise
i
said
hesitating
tell
you
about
it
later
i
had
time
to
think
while
i
been
coming
back
in
the
train
and
i
thought
of
many
things
mount
guard
till
i
return
and
mind
you
do
let
lord
southminster
have
access
to
anything
shoot
him
first
dear
and
i
believe
she
meant
it
i
drove
on
in
the
same
cab
to
harold
solicitor
there
i
laid
my
fresh
doubts
at
once
before
him
he
rubbed
his
bony
hands
hit
it
he
cried
charmed
dear
madam
you
hit
it
i
never
did
like
that
will
i
never
did
like
the
signatures
the
witnesses
the
look
of
it
but
what
could
i
do
tillington
propounded
it
of
course
it
my
business
to
go
dead
against
my
own
client
you
doubted
harold
honour
mr
hayes
i
cried
flushing
illustration
never
he
answered
never
he
answered
i
felt
sure
there
must
be
some
mistake
somewhere
but
not
any
trickery
on
your
husband
part
now
supply
the
right
clue
we
must
look
into
this
immediately
he
hurried
round
with
me
at
once
in
the
same
cab
to
the
court
the
incriminated
will
had
been
as
they
call
it
but
under
certain
restrictions
and
subject
to
the
closest
surveillance
i
was
allowed
to
examine
it
with
my
husband
solicitor
before
the
eyes
of
the
authorities
i
looked
at
it
long
with
the
naked
eye
and
also
with
a
small
pocket
lens
the
paper
as
i
had
noted
before
was
the
same
kind
of
foolscap
as
that
which
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
using
at
my
office
in
florence
and
the
typewriting
was
it
mine
the
longer
i
looked
at
it
the
more
i
doubted
it
after
a
careful
examination
i
turned
round
to
our
solicitor
hayes
i
said
firmly
having
arrived
at
my
conclusion
is
the
document
i
at
florence
do
you
know
he
asked
different
machine
some
small
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
letters
the
rogue
who
typed
this
will
was
too
cunning
for
that
he
allow
himself
to
be
foiled
by
such
a
scholar
mate
it
is
written
with
a
spread
eagle
the
same
sort
of
machine
precisely
as
my
own
i
know
the
type
perfectly
but
i
hesitated
what
it
is
difficult
to
explain
there
is
character
in
typewriting
just
as
there
is
in
handwriting
only
of
course
not
quite
so
much
of
it
every
operator
is
liable
to
his
own
peculiar
tricks
and
blunders
if
i
had
some
of
my
own
typewritten
manuscript
here
to
show
you
i
could
soon
make
that
evident
can
easily
believe
it
individuality
runs
through
all
we
do
however
seemingly
mechanical
but
are
the
points
of
a
sort
that
you
could
make
clear
in
court
to
the
satisfaction
of
a
jury
think
so
look
here
for
example
certain
letters
get
habitually
mixed
up
in
typewriting
and
stand
next
one
another
on
the
keyboard
of
the
machine
and
the
person
who
typed
this
draft
sometimes
strikes
a
instead
of
a
or
i
never
do
that
the
letters
i
tend
to
confuse
are
and
or
else
and
which
also
come
very
near
one
another
in
the
arbitrary
arrangement
besides
when
i
the
original
of
this
will
i
made
no
errors
at
all
i
took
such
very
great
pains
about
it
this
person
did
make
errors
struck
the
wrong
letter
first
and
then
corrected
it
often
by
striking
another
rather
hard
on
top
of
it
see
this
was
a
to
begin
with
and
he
turned
it
into
a
besides
the
hand
that
wrote
this
will
is
heavier
than
mine
it
comes
down
while
mine
glides
lightly
and
the
hyphens
are
used
with
a
space
between
them
and
the
character
of
the
punctuation
is
not
exactly
as
i
make
it
hayes
objected
have
nothing
but
your
word
i
afraid
in
such
a
case
we
could
never
induce
a
jury
to
accept
your
unsupported
evidence
do
want
them
to
accept
it
i
answered
am
looking
this
up
for
my
own
satisfaction
i
want
to
know
first
who
wrote
this
will
and
of
one
thing
i
am
quite
clear
it
is
the
document
i
drew
up
for
ashurst
just
look
at
that
the
alone
is
conclusive
my
typewriter
had
the
upper
stroke
of
the
small
badly
formed
or
broken
while
this
one
is
perfect
i
remember
it
well
because
i
used
always
to
improve
all
my
with
a
pen
when
i
and
corrected
i
see
their
dodge
clearly
now
it
is
a
most
diabolical
conspiracy
instead
of
forging
a
will
in
lord
favour
they
have
substituted
a
forgery
for
the
real
will
and
then
managed
to
make
my
poor
harold
prove
it
that
case
no
doubt
they
have
destroyed
the
real
one
the
original
hayes
put
in
do
think
so
i
answered
after
a
moment
deliberation
what
i
know
of
ashurst
i
do
believe
it
is
likely
he
would
have
left
his
will
about
carelessly
anywhere
he
was
a
secretive
man
fond
of
mysteries
and
mystifications
he
would
be
sure
to
conceal
it
besides
lady
georgina
and
harold
have
been
taking
care
of
everything
in
the
house
ever
since
he
died
hayes
objected
forger
of
this
document
supposing
it
to
be
forged
must
have
had
access
to
the
original
since
you
say
the
terms
of
the
two
are
identical
only
the
signatures
are
forgeries
and
if
he
saw
and
copied
it
why
might
he
not
also
have
destroyed
it
a
light
flashed
across
me
all
at
once
forger
see
the
original
i
cried
not
the
fair
copy
i
have
it
all
now
i
detect
their
trick
it
comes
back
to
me
vividly
when
i
had
finished
typing
the
copy
at
florence
from
my
first
rough
draft
which
i
had
taken
down
on
the
machine
before
ashurst
eyes
i
remember
now
that
i
threw
the
original
into
the
basket
it
must
have
been
there
that
evening
when
higginson
called
and
asked
for
the
will
to
take
it
back
to
ashurst
he
called
for
it
no
doubt
hoping
to
open
the
packet
before
he
delivered
it
and
make
a
copy
of
the
document
for
this
very
purpose
but
i
refused
to
let
him
have
it
before
he
saw
me
however
he
had
been
left
by
himself
for
ten
minutes
in
the
office
for
i
remember
coming
out
to
him
and
finding
him
there
alone
and
during
that
ten
minutes
being
what
he
is
you
may
be
sure
he
fished
out
the
rough
draft
and
appropriated
it
illustration
we
shall
have
him
in
our
power
is
more
than
likely
my
solicitor
nodded
are
tracking
him
to
his
lair
we
shall
have
him
in
our
power
i
grew
more
and
more
excited
as
the
whole
cunning
plot
unravelled
itself
mentally
step
by
step
before
me
must
then
have
gone
to
lord
southminster
i
went
on
told
him
of
the
legacy
he
expected
from
ashurst
it
was
five
hundred
pounds
a
mere
trifle
to
higginson
who
plays
for
thousands
so
he
must
have
offered
to
arrange
matters
for
lord
southminster
if
southminster
would
consent
to
make
good
that
sum
and
a
great
deal
more
to
him
that
odious
little
cad
told
me
himself
on
the
they
were
engaged
in
pulling
off
a
big
between
them
he
thought
then
i
would
marry
him
and
that
he
would
so
secure
my
connivance
in
his
plans
but
who
would
marry
such
a
piece
of
moist
clay
besides
i
could
never
have
taken
anyone
but
harold
then
another
clue
came
home
to
me
hayes
i
cried
jumping
at
it
who
forged
this
will
never
saw
the
real
document
itself
at
all
he
saw
only
the
draft
for
ashurst
altered
one
word
in
the
original
at
the
last
moment
and
i
made
a
pencil
note
of
it
on
my
cuff
at
the
time
and
see
it
is
here
though
i
inserted
it
in
the
final
clean
copy
of
the
will
the
word
it
grows
upon
me
more
and
more
each
minute
that
the
real
instrument
is
hidden
somewhere
in
ashurst
house
harold
house
our
house
and
that
it
is
there
lord
southminster
is
so
indecently
anxious
to
oust
his
aunt
and
take
instant
possession
that
case
hayes
remarked
had
better
go
back
to
lady
georgina
without
one
minute
delay
and
while
she
still
holds
the
house
institute
a
thorough
search
for
it
no
sooner
said
than
done
we
jumped
again
into
our
cab
and
started
as
we
drove
back
hayes
asked
me
where
i
thought
we
were
most
likely
to
find
it
a
secret
drawer
in
ashurst
desk
i
answered
by
a
flash
of
instinct
without
a
second
hesitation
do
you
know
there
a
secret
drawer
do
know
it
i
infer
it
from
my
general
knowledge
of
character
he
loved
secret
drawers
ciphers
cryptograms
it
was
in
that
desk
that
your
husband
found
the
forged
document
the
lawyer
objected
once
more
i
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
or
intuition
white
ashurst
valet
had
it
in
readiness
in
his
possession
i
answered
hid
it
there
in
the
most
obvious
and
unconcealed
place
he
could
find
as
soon
as
the
breath
was
out
of
his
master
body
i
remember
now
lord
southminster
gave
himself
away
to
some
extent
in
that
matter
the
hateful
little
creature
is
really
clever
enough
for
all
his
cunning
and
with
higginson
to
back
him
to
mix
himself
up
in
such
tricks
as
forgery
he
told
me
at
aden
he
had
had
a
telegram
from
marmy
valet
to
report
progress
and
he
received
another
the
night
ashurst
died
at
moozuffernuggar
depend
upon
it
white
was
more
or
less
in
this
plot
higginson
left
him
the
forged
will
when
they
started
for
india
and
as
soon
as
ashurst
died
white
hid
it
where
harold
was
bound
to
find
it
so
hayes
answered
well
we
have
something
to
go
upon
the
more
of
them
the
better
there
is
safety
in
numbers
for
the
honest
folk
i
never
knew
three
rogues
hold
long
together
especially
when
threatened
with
a
criminal
prosecution
their
confederacy
breaks
down
before
the
chance
of
punishment
each
tries
to
screen
himself
by
betraying
the
others
was
the
soul
of
this
plot
i
went
on
that
you
may
be
sure
he
a
wily
old
fox
but
we
run
him
to
earth
yet
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
feel
sure
from
what
i
know
of
character
he
would
never
have
put
that
will
in
so
exposed
a
place
as
the
one
where
harold
says
he
found
it
we
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
disputed
house
just
in
time
for
the
siege
hayes
and
i
walked
in
we
found
lady
georgina
face
to
face
with
lord
southminster
the
opposing
forces
were
still
at
the
stage
of
preliminaries
of
warfare
heah
the
young
man
was
observing
in
his
drawling
voice
as
we
entered
no
use
your
talking
deah
georgey
this
house
is
mine
and
i
wo
have
you
meddling
with
it
house
is
not
yours
you
odious
little
scamp
his
aunt
retorted
raising
her
shrill
voice
some
notes
higher
than
usual
while
i
can
hold
a
stick
you
shall
not
come
inside
it
well
then
you
drive
me
to
hostilities
do
yah
know
i
sorry
to
show
disrespect
to
your
gray
hairs
if
any
but
i
shall
be
obliged
to
call
in
the
police
to
eject
yah
them
in
if
you
like
i
answered
interposing
between
them
out
and
get
them
hayes
while
he
gone
send
for
a
carpenter
to
break
open
the
back
of
ashurst
escritoire
carpentah
he
cried
turning
several
degrees
whiter
than
his
pasty
wont
for
a
carpentah
i
spoke
distinctly
we
have
reason
to
believe
real
will
is
concealed
in
this
house
in
a
secret
drawer
and
because
the
keys
were
in
the
possession
of
white
whom
we
believe
to
be
your
accomplice
in
this
shallow
conspiracy
he
gasped
and
looked
alarmed
you
do
he
cried
stepping
briskly
forward
do
i
tell
yah
break
open
marmy
desk
why
hang
it
all
it
my
property
shall
see
about
that
after
we
broken
it
open
i
answered
grimly
this
will
do
the
back
not
strong
now
your
help
hayes
one
two
three
we
can
prise
it
apart
between
us
lord
southminster
rushed
up
and
tried
to
prevent
us
but
lady
georgina
seizing
both
wrists
held
him
tight
as
in
a
vice
with
her
dear
skinny
old
hands
he
writhed
and
struggled
all
in
vain
he
could
not
escape
her
often
spanked
you
bertie
she
cried
if
you
attempt
to
interfere
i
spank
you
again
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
he
broke
from
her
and
rushed
out
to
call
the
police
i
believe
and
prevent
our
desecration
of
pooah
marmy
property
illustration
victory
inside
the
first
shell
were
several
locked
drawers
and
two
or
three
open
ones
out
of
one
of
which
harold
had
fished
the
false
will
instinct
taught
me
somehow
that
the
central
drawer
on
the
side
was
the
compartment
behind
which
lay
the
secret
receptacle
i
prised
it
apart
and
peered
about
inside
it
presently
i
saw
a
which
i
touched
with
one
finger
the
flew
open
and
disclosed
a
narrow
slit
i
clutched
at
something
the
will
ho
victory
the
will
i
raised
it
aloft
with
a
wild
shout
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
real
the
genuine
document
we
turned
it
over
and
read
it
it
was
my
own
fair
copy
written
at
florence
and
bearing
all
the
small
marks
of
authenticity
about
it
which
i
had
pointed
out
to
hayes
as
wanting
to
the
forged
and
impounded
document
fortunately
lady
georgina
and
four
of
the
servants
had
stood
by
throughout
this
scene
and
had
watched
our
demeanour
as
well
as
lord
southminster
we
turned
next
to
the
signatures
the
principal
one
was
clearly
ashurst
i
knew
it
at
once
his
legible
fat
hand
courtney
ashurst
and
then
the
witnesses
they
fairly
took
our
breath
away
higginson
sister
is
one
of
them
at
all
hayes
cried
astonished
a
flush
of
remorse
came
over
me
i
saw
it
all
now
i
had
misjudged
that
poor
woman
she
had
the
misfortune
to
be
a
rogue
sister
but
as
harold
had
said
was
herself
a
most
respectable
and
blameless
person
higginson
must
have
forged
her
name
to
the
document
that
was
all
and
she
had
naturally
sworn
that
she
never
signed
it
he
knew
her
honesty
it
was
a
of
rascality
other
one
is
here
either
i
exclaimed
growing
more
puzzled
waiter
at
the
hotel
why
that
another
forgery
higginson
must
have
waited
till
the
man
was
safely
dead
and
then
used
him
similarly
it
was
all
very
clever
now
who
are
these
people
who
really
witnessed
it
first
one
hayes
said
examining
the
handwriting
sir
roger
bland
the
dorsetshire
baronet
he
dead
poor
fellow
but
he
was
at
florence
at
the
time
and
i
can
answer
for
his
signature
he
was
a
client
of
mine
and
died
at
mentone
the
second
is
captain
richards
of
the
mounted
police
he
living
still
but
he
away
in
south
africa
they
risked
his
turning
up
they
knew
who
the
real
witnesses
were
at
all
which
is
doubtful
you
see
as
you
say
they
may
have
seen
the
rough
draft
only
would
know
i
answered
was
with
ashurst
at
florence
at
the
time
and
he
would
take
good
care
to
keep
a
watch
upon
his
movements
in
my
belief
it
was
he
who
suggested
this
whole
plot
to
lord
southminster
course
it
was
lady
georgina
put
in
absolutely
certain
bertie
a
rogue
as
well
as
a
fool
but
he
too
great
a
fool
to
invent
a
clever
roguery
and
too
great
a
knave
not
to
join
in
it
foolishly
when
anybody
else
takes
the
pains
to
invent
it
it
a
clever
roguery
hayes
interposed
ordinary
rascal
would
have
forged
a
later
will
in
lord
southminster
favour
and
run
the
risk
of
detection
higginson
had
the
acuteness
to
forge
a
will
exactly
like
the
real
one
and
to
let
your
husband
bear
the
burden
of
the
forgery
it
was
as
sagacious
as
it
was
ruthless
next
point
i
said
be
for
us
to
prove
it
at
that
moment
the
bell
rang
and
one
of
the
all
puzzled
by
this
conflict
of
interests
came
in
with
a
telegram
which
he
handed
me
on
a
salver
i
broke
it
open
without
glancing
at
the
envelope
its
contents
baffled
me
address
is
hotel
bristol
paris
name
as
usual
send
me
a
thousand
pounds
on
account
at
once
i
ca
afford
to
wait
no
shillyshallying
the
message
was
unsigned
for
a
moment
i
could
imagine
who
sent
it
or
what
it
was
driving
at
then
i
took
up
the
envelope
southminster
park
lane
north
london
my
heart
gave
a
jump
i
saw
in
a
second
that
chance
or
providence
had
delivered
the
conspirators
into
my
hands
that
day
the
telegram
was
from
higginson
i
had
opened
it
by
accident
it
was
obvious
what
had
happened
lord
southminster
must
have
written
to
him
on
the
result
of
the
trial
and
told
him
he
meant
to
take
possession
of
his
uncle
house
immediately
higginson
had
acted
on
that
hint
and
addressed
his
telegram
where
he
thought
it
likely
lord
southminster
would
receive
it
earliest
i
had
opened
it
in
error
and
that
too
was
fortunate
for
even
in
dealing
with
such
a
pack
of
scoundrels
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
violate
somebody
else
correspondence
had
i
not
thought
it
was
addressed
to
me
but
having
arrived
at
the
truth
thus
unintentionally
i
had
of
course
no
scruples
about
making
full
use
of
my
information
i
showed
the
despatch
at
once
to
lady
georgina
and
hayes
they
recognised
its
importance
next
i
inquired
presses
at
three
harold
comes
up
for
examination
at
bow
street
hayes
was
ready
with
an
apt
expedient
the
bell
for
ashurst
valet
he
said
quietly
moment
has
now
arrived
when
we
can
begin
to
set
these
conspirators
by
the
ears
as
soon
as
they
learn
that
we
know
all
they
will
be
eager
to
inform
upon
one
another
i
rang
the
bell
up
white
i
said
wish
to
speak
to
him
the
valet
stole
up
a
timid
servile
creature
rubbing
his
hands
nervously
and
suspecting
mischief
he
was
a
rat
in
trouble
he
had
thin
brown
hair
neatly
brushed
and
plastered
down
so
as
to
make
it
look
still
thinner
and
his
face
was
the
average
narrow
cunning
face
of
the
dishonest
it
had
an
ounce
of
wile
in
it
to
a
pound
or
two
of
servility
he
seemed
just
the
sort
of
rogue
meanly
to
join
in
an
underhand
conspiracy
and
then
meanly
to
back
out
of
it
you
could
read
at
a
glance
that
his
principle
in
life
was
to
save
his
own
bacon
illustration
you
wished
to
see
me
sir
he
advanced
fumbling
his
hands
all
the
time
and
smiling
and
fawning
wished
to
see
me
sir
he
murmured
in
a
deprecatory
voice
looking
sideways
at
lady
georgina
and
me
but
addressing
the
lawyer
white
i
wished
to
see
you
i
have
a
question
to
ask
you
put
the
forged
will
in
ashurst
desk
was
it
you
or
some
other
person
the
question
terrified
him
he
changed
colour
and
gasped
but
he
rubbed
his
hands
harder
than
ever
and
affected
a
sickly
smile
sir
how
should
know
sir
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
suppose
it
was
mr
tillington
our
lawyer
pounced
upon
him
like
a
hawk
on
a
titmouse
prevaricate
with
me
sir
he
said
sternly
you
do
it
may
be
worse
for
you
this
case
has
assumed
quite
another
aspect
it
is
you
and
your
associates
who
will
be
placed
in
the
dock
not
tillington
you
had
better
speak
the
truth
it
is
your
one
chance
i
warn
you
lie
to
me
and
instead
of
calling
you
as
a
witness
for
our
case
i
shall
include
you
in
the
indictment
white
looked
down
uneasily
at
his
shoes
and
cowered
sir
i
understand
you
you
do
you
understand
me
and
you
know
i
mean
it
wriggling
is
useless
we
intend
to
prosecute
we
have
unravelled
this
vile
plot
we
know
the
whole
truth
higginson
and
lord
southminster
forged
a
will
between
them
sir
lord
southminster
his
lordship
i
sure
hayes
keen
eye
had
noted
the
subtle
shade
of
distinction
and
admission
but
he
said
nothing
openly
then
higginson
forged
and
lord
southminster
accepted
a
false
will
which
purported
to
be
marmaduke
ashurst
now
follow
me
clearly
that
will
could
not
have
been
put
into
the
escritoire
during
ashurst
life
for
there
would
have
been
risk
of
his
discovering
it
it
must
therefore
have
been
put
there
afterward
the
moment
he
was
dead
you
or
somebody
else
with
your
consent
and
connivance
slipped
it
into
the
escritoire
and
you
afterwards
showed
tillington
the
place
where
you
had
set
it
or
seen
it
set
leading
him
to
believe
it
was
ashurst
will
and
so
involved
him
in
all
this
trouble
note
that
that
was
a
felonious
act
we
accuse
you
of
felony
do
you
mean
to
confess
and
give
evidence
on
our
behalf
or
will
you
force
me
to
send
for
a
policeman
to
arrest
you
the
cur
hesitated
still
sir
drawing
back
and
fumbling
his
hands
on
his
breast
do
mean
it
hayes
was
prompt
go
for
a
policeman
that
curt
sentence
brought
the
rogue
on
his
at
once
he
clasped
his
hands
and
debated
inwardly
i
tell
you
all
i
know
he
said
at
last
looking
about
him
with
an
air
of
abject
terror
as
if
he
thought
lord
southminster
or
higginson
would
hear
him
you
promise
not
to
prosecute
me
his
tone
became
insinuating
a
hundred
pounds
i
could
find
the
real
will
for
you
you
better
close
with
me
is
the
last
chance
as
soon
as
his
lordship
comes
in
he
hunt
it
up
and
destroy
it
i
flourished
it
before
him
and
pointed
with
one
hand
to
the
broken
desk
which
he
had
not
yet
observed
in
his
craven
agitation
do
not
need
your
aid
i
answered
have
found
the
will
ourselves
thanks
to
lady
georgina
it
is
safe
till
this
minute
to
me
he
put
in
cringing
and
trying
after
his
kind
to
curry
favour
with
the
winners
at
the
last
moment
all
doing
my
lady
i
would
destroy
it
his
lordship
offered
me
a
hundred
pounds
more
to
break
open
the
back
of
the
desk
at
night
while
your
ladyship
was
asleep
and
burn
the
thing
quietly
but
i
told
him
he
might
do
his
own
dirty
work
if
he
wanted
it
done
it
was
good
enough
while
your
ladyship
was
here
in
possession
besides
i
wanted
the
right
will
preserved
for
i
thought
things
might
turn
up
so
and
i
would
stand
by
and
see
a
gentleman
like
tillington
as
has
always
behaved
well
to
me
deprived
of
his
inheritance
is
why
you
conspired
with
lord
southminster
to
rob
him
of
it
and
to
send
him
to
prison
for
higginson
crime
i
interposed
calmly
you
confess
you
put
the
forged
will
there
hayes
said
getting
to
business
white
looked
about
him
helplessly
he
missed
his
headpiece
the
instigator
of
the
plot
it
was
like
this
my
lady
he
began
turning
to
lady
georgina
and
wriggling
to
gain
time
see
his
lordship
and
higginson
he
twirled
his
thumbs
and
tried
to
invent
something
plausible
lady
georgina
swooped
rigmarole
she
said
sharply
you
confess
you
put
it
there
or
do
you
not
reptile
her
vehemence
startled
him
i
confess
i
put
it
there
he
said
at
last
blinking
soon
as
the
breath
was
out
of
ashurst
body
i
put
it
there
he
began
to
whimper
a
poor
man
with
a
wife
and
family
sir
he
went
on
in
ashurst
time
i
always
kep
that
quiet
and
his
lordship
offered
to
pay
me
well
for
the
job
and
when
you
paid
well
for
a
job
yourself
sir
hayes
waved
him
off
with
one
imperious
hand
down
in
the
corner
there
man
and
do
move
or
utter
another
word
he
said
sternly
i
order
you
you
will
be
in
time
still
for
me
to
produce
at
bow
street
just
at
that
moment
lord
southminster
swaggered
back
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
unwilling
policemen
i
say
he
cried
bursting
in
and
staring
around
him
jubilant
heah
georgey
you
going
quietly
or
must
i
ask
these
coppahs
to
evict
you
he
was
wreathed
in
smiles
now
and
had
evidently
been
fortifying
himself
with
brandies
and
soda
lady
georgina
rose
in
her
wrath
i
go
if
you
wish
it
bertie
she
answered
with
calm
irony
leave
the
house
as
soon
as
you
like
for
the
present
till
we
come
back
again
with
harold
and
policemen
to
evict
you
this
house
is
harold
your
game
is
played
boy
she
spoke
slowly
have
found
the
other
will
we
have
discovered
higginson
present
address
in
paris
and
we
know
from
white
how
he
and
you
arranged
this
little
conspiracy
illustration
well
this
is
a
fair
he
ejaculated
she
rapped
out
each
clause
in
this
last
accusing
sentence
with
deliberate
effect
like
so
many
each
bullet
hit
home
the
young
man
drawing
back
and
staring
stroked
his
shadowy
moustache
with
feeble
fingers
in
undisguised
astonishment
then
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
fixed
his
gaze
blankly
on
lady
georgina
this
is
a
fair
he
ejaculated
fatuously
disconcerted
wish
higginson
was
heah
i
really
do
quite
know
what
to
do
without
him
that
fellah
had
squared
it
all
up
so
neatly
do
yah
know
that
i
thought
there
could
be
any
sort
of
hitch
in
the
proceedings
reckoned
without
lois
lady
georgina
said
calmly
miss
cayley
that
true
i
mean
tillington
yaas
yaas
i
know
she
a
doosid
clevah
person
for
a
woman
now
is
she
it
was
impossible
to
take
this
flabby
creature
seriously
even
as
a
criminal
lady
georgina
lips
relaxed
clever
she
admitted
looking
at
me
almost
tenderly
not
quite
so
clevah
do
yah
know
as
higginson
you
make
your
blooming
little
erraw
hayes
burst
in
adopting
one
of
lord
southminster
favourite
witticisms
the
sort
of
witticism
that
improves
like
poetry
by
frequent
repetition
you
may
go
into
the
next
room
and
wait
this
is
a
family
affair
we
have
no
immediate
need
of
you
certainly
lord
southminster
echoed
much
relieved
propah
sentiment
most
undesirable
that
the
constables
should
mix
themselves
up
in
a
family
mattah
like
this
not
the
place
for
inferiahs
why
introduce
them
lady
georgina
burst
out
turning
on
him
he
smiled
his
fatuous
smile
just
what
i
say
he
answered
the
jooce
introduce
them
but
do
snap
my
head
off
the
policemen
withdrew
respectfully
glad
to
be
relieved
of
this
unpleasant
business
where
they
could
gain
no
credit
and
might
possibly
involve
themselves
in
a
charge
of
assault
lord
southminster
rose
with
a
benevolent
grin
and
looked
about
him
pleasantly
the
brandies
and
soda
had
endowed
him
with
irrepressible
cheerfulness
lady
georgina
murmured
i
think
i
leave
now
georgey
you
trumped
my
ace
yah
know
nasty
trick
of
white
to
go
and
round
on
a
fellah
i
do
like
the
turn
this
business
is
taking
seems
to
me
the
only
way
i
have
left
to
get
out
of
it
is
to
turn
queen
evidence
lady
georgina
planted
herself
firmly
against
the
door
she
cried
you
do
not
till
we
got
what
we
want
out
of
you
he
gazed
at
her
blandly
his
face
broke
once
more
into
an
imbecile
smile
were
always
a
rough
georgey
your
hand
did
sting
well
what
do
you
want
now
we
each
played
our
cards
and
you
need
cut
up
rusty
over
it
especially
when
you
winning
hang
it
all
i
wish
i
had
higginson
heah
to
tackle
you
you
go
to
see
the
treasury
people
or
the
or
the
public
prosecutor
or
whoever
else
it
may
be
lady
georgina
said
stoutly
hayes
must
go
with
you
we
trumped
your
ace
as
you
say
and
we
mean
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
then
you
must
trundle
yourself
down
to
bow
street
afterwards
confess
the
whole
truth
and
set
harold
at
liberty
i
say
now
georgey
the
whole
truth
the
whole
blooming
truth
that
really
what
i
call
humiliating
a
fellah
you
do
we
arrest
you
this
minute
fourteen
years
imprisonment
yeahs
he
wiped
his
forehead
i
say
how
doosid
uncomfortable
i
was
nevah
much
good
at
doing
anything
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
i
ought
to
have
lived
in
the
garden
of
eden
georgey
hard
on
a
chap
when
he
down
on
his
luck
it
would
be
confounded
cruel
to
send
me
to
fourteen
yeahs
at
portland
would
have
sent
my
husband
to
it
i
broke
in
angrily
confronting
him
you
too
miss
cayley
i
mean
tillington
do
look
at
me
like
that
tigahs
are
in
it
his
jauntiness
disarmed
us
however
wicked
he
might
be
one
felt
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
imprison
this
schoolboy
a
sound
flogging
and
a
month
deprivation
of
wine
and
cigarettes
was
the
obvious
punishment
designed
for
him
by
nature
must
go
down
to
the
and
confess
this
whole
conspiracy
lady
georgina
went
on
after
a
pause
as
sternly
as
she
was
able
prefer
if
we
can
to
save
the
family
even
you
bertie
but
i
ca
any
longer
save
the
family
honour
i
can
only
save
harold
you
must
help
me
to
do
that
and
then
you
must
give
me
your
solemn
promise
in
writing
to
leave
england
for
ever
and
go
to
live
in
south
africa
he
stroked
the
invisible
moustache
more
nervously
than
before
that
penalty
came
home
to
him
leave
england
for
evah
newmarket
ascot
the
club
the
fourteen
years
imprisonment
you
spank
as
hard
as
evah
at
once
or
we
arrest
you
he
glanced
about
him
feebly
i
could
see
he
was
longing
for
his
lost
confederate
i
go
he
said
at
last
sobering
down
your
solicitaw
can
trot
round
with
me
i
do
all
that
you
wish
though
i
call
it
most
unfriendly
hang
it
all
fourteen
yeahs
would
be
so
beastly
unpleasant
we
drove
forthwith
to
the
proper
authorities
who
on
hearing
the
facts
at
once
arranged
to
accept
lord
southminster
and
white
as
evidence
neither
being
the
actual
forger
we
also
telegraphed
to
paris
to
have
higginson
arrested
lord
southminster
giving
us
up
his
assumed
name
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
and
without
one
moment
compunction
hayes
was
quite
right
each
conspirator
was
only
too
ready
to
save
himself
by
betraying
his
fellows
then
we
drove
on
to
bow
street
lord
southminster
consoling
himself
with
a
cigarette
on
the
way
just
in
time
for
harold
case
which
was
to
be
taken
by
special
arrangement
at
a
very
few
minutes
sufficed
to
turn
the
tables
completely
on
the
conspirators
harold
was
discharged
and
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
arrest
of
higginson
the
actual
forger
he
had
drawn
up
the
false
will
and
signed
it
with
ashurst
name
after
which
he
had
presented
it
for
lord
southminster
approval
the
young
man

to
turn
back

delightful
writer
the

generation
is
supposed
not
to
read
miss
austen
which
if
true
is
hardly
creditable
to
its
education

good

latterly
there
