alan
green
was
not
exactly
a
hero
in
fact
he
liked
peace
just
as
well
as
the
next
man
not
that
he
was
really
afraid
of
that
crazy
alzo
or
even
of
the
hound
gorgeous
owner
the
duchess
zuni
who
was
also
to
say
nothing
of
the
duke
after
all
these
things
were
understood
on
this
backward
violent
planet
and
a
man
could
manage
provided
he
was
alert
hours
a
day
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
alan
was
only
normally
apprehensive
of
his
junoesque
tempestuous
but
altogether
lovable
wife
amra
delightful
demanding
amra
and
her
five
uproarious
kids
the
trouble
was
he
was
tired
and
homesick
so
when
he
heard
of
two
other
downed
spacemen
he
hitched
a
ride
with
a
piratical
on
a
windroller
destined
to
carry
him
to
the
spaceship
and
thence
to
the
peaceful
green
hills
of
earth
but
he
had
reckoned
without
the
vagaries
of
the
windroller
pirates
the
traveling
islands
the
rascally
captain
and
various
flora
and
fauna
peculiar
to
this
planet
all
of
which
it
now
seemed
regarded
alan
with
unnerving
malevolence
and
worst
of
all
amra
was
determined
that
he
should
be
a
hero
amra
won
for
two
years
alan
green
had
lived
without
hope
from
the
day
the
spaceship
had
crashed
on
this
unknown
planet
he
had
resigned
himself
to
the
destiny
created
for
him
by
accident
and
mathematics
chances
against
another
ship
landing
within
the
next
hundred
years
were
a
million
to
one
therefore
it
would
do
no
good
to
sit
around
waiting
for
rescue
much
as
he
loathed
the
idea
he
must
live
the
rest
of
his
life
here
and
he
must
squeeze
as
much
blood
as
he
could
out
of
this
turnip
there
was
much
to
squeeze
in
fact
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
the
one
losing
the
blood
shortly
after
he
been
cast
away
he
been
made
a
slave
now
suddenly
he
had
hope
hope
came
to
him
a
month
after
he
been
made
foreman
of
the
kitchen
slaves
of
the
duke
of
tropat
it
came
to
him
as
he
was
standing
behind
the
duchess
during
a
meal
and
directing
those
who
were
waiting
upon
her
it
was
the
duchess
zuni
who
had
not
so
subtly
maneuvered
him
from
the
labor
pens
to
his
coveted
if
dangerous
position
why
dangerous
because
she
was
very
jealous
and
possessive
and
the
slightest
hint
of
lack
of
attention
from
him
could
mean
he
lose
his
life
or
one
limb
or
another
the
knowledge
of
what
had
happened
to
his
two
predecessors
kept
him
extremely
sensitive
to
her
every
gesture
her
every
wish
that
fateful
morning
he
was
standing
behind
her
as
she
sat
at
one
end
of
the
long
breakfast
table
in
one
hand
he
held
his
foreman
wand
a
little
white
baton
topped
by
a
large
red
ball
with
it
he
gestured
at
the
slaves
who
served
food
who
poured
wine
and
beer
who
fanned
away
the
flies
who
carried
in
the
household
god
and
sat
it
on
the
god
chair
who
played
something
like
music
now
and
then
he
bent
over
the
duchess
zuni
long
black
hair
and
whispered
phrases
from
this
or
that
love
poem
praising
her
beauty
her
supposed
unattainability
and
his
burning
if
seemingly
hopeless
passion
for
her
zuni
would
smile
or
repeat
the
formula
of
thanks
the
short
one
or
else
giggle
at
his
funny
accent
the
duke
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
he
ignored
the
just
as
he
ignored
the
secret
passage
inside
the
walls
of
the
castle
which
green
used
to
get
to
the
duchess
apartments
custom
demanded
this
just
as
custom
demanded
that
he
should
play
the
outraged
husband
if
she
got
tired
of
green
or
angry
at
him
and
accused
him
publicly
of
amorous
advances
this
was
enough
to
make
green
jittery
but
he
had
more
than
the
duke
to
consider
there
was
alzo
alzo
was
the
duchess
watchdog
a
monster
with
shaggy
hair
the
dog
hated
green
with
a
vindictiveness
that
green
could
only
account
for
by
supposing
that
the
animal
knew
perhaps
from
his
that
he
was
not
a
native
of
this
planet
alzo
rumbled
a
warning
deep
in
his
chest
every
time
green
bent
over
the
duchess
or
made
a
movement
occasionally
he
rose
to
his
four
feet
and
nuzzled
the
man
leg
when
that
happened
green
could
not
keep
from
breaking
out
into
a
sweat
for
the
dog
had
twice
bitten
him
playfully
so
to
speak
and
severely
lacerated
his
calf
as
if
that
were
bad
enough
green
had
to
worry
that
the
natives
might
notice
that
his
scars
healed
abnormally
fast
almost
overnight
he
been
forced
to
wear
bandages
on
his
legs
long
after
the
new
skin
had
come
in
even
now
the
nauseating
canine
was
sniffing
around
green
quivering
hide
in
the
hope
of
putting
the
fear
of
the
devil
in
him
at
that
moment
the
earthman
resolved
that
come
the
headsman
ax
rack
wheel
or
other
hellish
tortures
he
was
going
to
kill
that
hound
it
was
just
after
he
made
that
vow
that
the
duchess
caused
him
to
forget
altogether
the
beast
dear
said
zuni
interrupting
the
duke
in
the
midst
of
his
conversation
with
a
what
is
this
i
hear
about
two
men
who
have
fallen
from
the
sky
in
a
great
ship
of
iron
green
quivered
and
he
held
his
breath
as
he
waited
for
the
reply
the
duke
a
short
dark
man
with
white
hair
and
very
thick
bristly
eyebrows
frowned
men
demons
rather
can
men
fly
in
an
iron
ship
through
the
air
these
two
claimed
to
have
come
from
the
stars
and
you
know
what
that
means
remember
oixrotl
prophecy
demon
will
come
claiming
to
be
an
no
doubt
about
these
two
just
to
show
you
their
subtlety
they
claim
to
be
neither
demon
nor
angels
but
men
now
there
devilish
clever
thinking
confusing
to
anybody
but
the
most
i
glad
the
king
of
estorya
was
taken
in
eagerly
zuni
leaned
forward
her
large
brown
eyes
bright
and
her
mouth
open
and
wet
oh
has
he
burned
them
already
what
a
shame
i
should
think
he
at
least
torture
them
for
a
while
miran
the
said
your
pardon
gracious
lady
but
the
king
of
estorya
has
done
no
such
thing
the
estoryan
law
demands
that
all
suspected
demons
should
be
kept
in
prison
for
two
years
everybody
knows
that
a
devil
ca
keep
his
human
disguise
more
than
two
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
reverts
to
his
natural
flesh
and
form
a
hideous
sight
to
behold
blasphemous
repulsive
miran
rolled
his
one
good
eye
so
that
only
the
white
showed
and
made
the
sign
to
ward
off
evil
the
index
finger
held
rigidly
out
from
a
clenched
fist
jugkaxtr
the
household
priest
dived
under
the
table
where
he
crouched
praying
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
demons
touch
him
while
he
knelt
beneath
the
wood
the
duke
swallowed
a
whole
glass
of
wine
apparently
to
calm
his
nerves
and
belched
miran
wiped
his
face
and
said
of
course
i
was
able
to
find
out
much
because
we
merchants
are
regarded
with
deep
suspicion
and
scarcely
dare
to
move
outside
the
harbor
or
the
marketplace
the
estoryans
worship
a
female
deity
ridiculous
is
it
and
eat
fish
they
hate
us
tropatians
because
we
worship
zaxropatr
male
of
males
and
because
they
must
depend
on
us
to
bring
them
fish
but
they
they
babble
on
and
on
to
us
especially
when
one
has
given
them
wine
for
nothing
green
finally
released
his
breath
in
a
sigh
of
relief
how
glad
he
was
that
he
had
never
told
these
people
his
true
origin
so
far
as
they
knew
he
was
merely
one
of
the
many
slaves
who
came
from
a
distant
country
in
the
north
miran
cleared
his
throat
adjusted
his
violet
turban
and
yellow
robes
pulled
gently
at
the
large
gold
ring
that
hung
from
his
nose
and
said
it
took
me
a
month
to
get
back
from
estorya
and
that
is
very
good
time
indeed
but
then
i
am
noted
for
my
good
luck
though
i
prefer
to
call
it
skill
plus
the
favor
given
by
the
gods
to
the
truly
devout
i
do
not
boast
o
gods
but
merely
give
you
tribute
because
you
have
smiled
upon
my
ventures
and
have
found
pleasing
the
scent
of
my
many
sacrifices
in
your
nostrils
green
lowered
his
eyelids
to
conceal
the
expression
of
disgust
which
he
felt
must
be
shining
from
them
at
the
same
time
he
saw
zuni
shoe
tapping
impatiently
inwardly
he
groaned
because
he
knew
she
would
divert
the
conversation
to
something
more
interesting
to
her
to
her
clothes
and
the
state
of
her
stomach
complexion
and
there
would
be
nothing
that
anybody
could
do
about
it
because
the
custom
was
that
the
woman
of
the
house
regulated
the
subject
of
talk
during
breakfast
if
only
this
had
been
lunch
or
dinner
then
the
men
would
theoretically
have
had
uncontested
control
these
two
demons
were
very
tall
like
your
slave
green
here
said
miran
and
they
could
not
speak
a
word
of
estoryan
or
at
least
they
claimed
they
could
when
king
raussmig
soldiers
tried
to
capture
them
they
brought
from
the
folds
of
their
strange
clothes
two
pistols
that
only
had
to
be
pointed
to
send
silent
and
awesome
and
sure
death
everywhere
men
dropped
dead
panic
overtook
many
but
there
were
brave
soldiers
who
kept
on
charging
and
eventually
the
magical
instruments
became
exhausted
the
demons
were
overpowered
and
put
into
the
tower
of
grass
cats
from
which
no
man
or
demon
has
yet
escaped
and
there
they
will
be
until
the
festival
of
the
sun
eye
then
they
will
be
burnt
from
beneath
the
table
rose
the
babble
of
the
priest
jugkaxtr
as
he
blessed
everyone
in
the
house
down
to
the
pup
and
the
fleas
living
thereoff
and
cursed
all
those
who
were
possessed
by
even
the
tiniest
demon
the
duke
growing
impatient
at
the
noise
kicked
under
the
table
jugkaxtr
yelped
and
presently
crawled
out
he
sat
down
and
began
gnawing
the
meat
from
a
bone
a
expression
on
his
fat
features
green
also
felt
like
kicking
him
just
as
he
often
felt
like
kicking
every
single
human
being
on
this
planet
it
was
hard
to
remember
that
he
must
exercise
compassion
and
understanding
for
them
and
that
his
own
remote
ancestors
had
once
been
just
as
nauseatingly
superstitious
cruel
and
bloody
there
was
a
big
difference
between
reading
about
such
people
and
actually
living
among
them
a
history
or
a
romantic
novel
could
describe
how
unwashed
and
diseased
and
primitives
were
but
only
the
substantial
stench
and
filth
could
make
your
gorge
rise
even
as
he
stood
there
zuni
powerful
perfume
rose
and
clung
in
heavy
festoons
about
him
and
slithered
down
his
nostrils
it
was
a
rare
and
expensive
perfume
brought
back
by
miran
from
his
voyages
and
given
to
her
as
a
token
of
the
merchant
esteem
used
in
small
quantities
it
would
have
been
quite
effective
to
express
feminine
daintiness
and
to
hint
at
delicate
passion
but
no
zuni
poured
it
like
water
over
her
hoping
to
cover
up
the
stale
odor
left
by
taking
a
bath
more
than
once
a
month
she
looked
so
beautiful
he
thought
and
stank
so
terribly
at
least
she
had
at
first
now
she
looked
less
beautiful
because
he
knew
how
stupid
she
was
and
did
stink
quite
so
badly
because
his
nostrils
had
become
somewhat
adjusted
they
had
to
i
intend
to
be
back
in
estorya
by
the
time
of
the
festival
said
miran
i
never
seen
the
eye
of
the
sun
burn
demons
before
it
a
giant
lens
you
know
there
will
be
just
time
enough
to
make
a
voyage
there
and
get
back
before
the
rainy
season
i
expect
to
make
even
greater
profits
than
the
last
time
because
i
established
some
highly
placed
contacts
o
gods
i
do
not
boast
but
merely
praise
your
favor
to
your
humble
worshiper
miran
the
merchant
of
the
clan
of
effenycan
please
bring
me
some
more
of
this
perfume
said
the
duchess
and
i
just
love
the
diamond
necklace
you
gave
me
diamonds
emeralds
rubies
cried
miran
kissing
his
hand
and
rolling
his
eye
ecstatically
i
tell
you
the
estoryans
are
rich
beyond
our
dreams
jewels
flow
in
their
marketplaces
like
drops
of
water
in
a
cataract
ah
if
only
the
emperor
could
be
induced
to
organize
a
great
raiding
fleet
and
storm
its
walls
he
remembers
too
well
what
happened
to
his
father
fleet
when
he
tried
it
growled
the
duke
the
storm
that
destroyed
his
thirty
ships
was
undoubtedly
raised
by
the
priests
of
the
goddess
hooda
i
still
think
that
the
expedition
would
have
succeeded
however
if
the
late
emperor
had
not
ignored
the
vision
that
came
to
him
the
night
before
they
set
sail
it
was
the
great
god
axoputqui
and
he
said
there
was
a
lengthy
conversation
which
did
not
hold
green
attention
he
was
too
busy
trying
to
think
of
a
plan
whereby
he
could
get
to
estorya
and
to
the
demons
iron
vessel
which
was
obviously
a
spaceship
this
was
his
only
chance
soon
the
rainy
season
would
start
and
there
would
be
no
vessels
leaving
for
at
least
three
months
he
could
of
course
just
walk
away
and
hope
to
get
to
estorya
on
foot
thousands
of
miles
through
countless
perils
and
he
had
only
a
general
idea
of
where
the
city
was
no
miran
was
his
only
hope
but
how
he
did
think
that
stowing
away
would
work
there
was
always
a
careful
search
for
slaves
who
might
try
just
that
very
plan
he
looked
at
miran
the
short
fat
fellow
with
many
chins
and
a
large
gold
ring
in
his
nose
the
fellow
was
shrewd
shrewd
and
he
would
not
want
to
offend
the
duchess
by
helping
her
official
gigolo
escape
not
that
is
unless
green
could
offer
him
something
that
was
so
valuable
that
he
could
afford
not
to
take
the
risk
miran
boasted
that
he
was
a
businessman
but
it
was
green
observation
that
there
was
always
a
large
soft
spot
in
that
supposedly
impenetrable
cranium
the
fissure
of
cupiditas
the
duke
rose
and
everybody
followed
his
example
jugkaxtr
chanted
the
formula
of
dismissal
then
sat
down
to
finish
gnawing
on
the
bone
the
others
filed
out
green
walked
in
front
of
zuni
in
order
to
warn
her
of
any
obstacles
in
her
path
and
to
take
the
brunt
of
any
attempted
assassination
as
he
did
so
he
was
seized
by
the
ankle
and
tripped
headlong
he
did
not
fall
hard
because
he
was
a
quick
man
in
spite
of
his
and
hundred
ninety
pounds
but
he
rose
because
of
the
loud
laughter
and
from
repressed
anger
at
alzo
who
had
again
repeated
his
trick
of
grabbing
green
leg
and
upsetting
him
he
wanted
to
grab
a
spear
from
a
nearby
guard
and
spit
alzo
but
that
would
be
the
end
of
green
and
whereas
up
to
now
there
had
been
many
times
when
he
would
not
particularly
have
cared
if
he
left
this
planet
via
the
death
route
he
could
not
now
make
a
false
move
not
when
escape
was
so
near
so
he
grinned
sheepishly
and
again
preceded
the
duchess
while
the
others
followed
her
out
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
broad
stone
staircase
that
led
to
the
upper
floors
of
the
castle
zuni
told
green
that
he
was
to
go
to
the
marketplace
and
buy
tomorrow
food
as
for
her
she
was
going
back
to
bed
and
sleep
until
noon
inwardly
green
groaned
how
long
could
he
keep
up
this
pace
he
was
expected
to
stay
up
half
the
night
with
her
then
attend
to
his
official
duties
during
the
day
she
slept
enough
to
be
refreshed
by
the
time
he
visited
her
but
he
never
had
a
chance
for
any
real
rest
even
when
he
had
his
free
hours
in
the
afternoon
he
had
to
go
to
his
house
in
the
pens
and
there
he
had
to
stay
awake
and
attend
to
all
his
familial
duties
and
amra
his
and
her
six
children
demanded
much
from
him
they
were
even
more
tyrannical
than
the
duchess
if
that
were
possible
how
long
o
lord
how
long
the
situation
was
intolerable
even
if
not
heard
of
the
spaceship
he
would
have
plotted
to
escape
better
a
quick
death
while
trying
to
get
away
than
a
slow
torturous
one
by
exhaustion
he
bowed
to
the
duke
and
duchess
then
followed
the
violet
turban
and
yellow
robes
of
miran
through
the
courtyard
through
the
thick
stone
walls
over
the
bridge
of
the
broad
moat
and
into
the
narrow
winding
streets
of
the
city
of
quotz
here
the
got
into
his
rickshaw
the
two
men
between
its
shafts
sailors
and
clansmen
from
miran
vessel
the
of
began
running
through
the
crowd
the
people
made
way
for
them
as
two
other
sailors
preceded
them
calling
out
miran
name
and
cracking
whips
in
the
air
green
after
looking
to
make
certain
that
nobody
from
the
castle
was
around
to
see
him
ran
until
he
was
even
with
the
rickshaw
miran
halted
it
and
asked
what
he
wanted
your
pardon
your
richness
but
may
a
humble
slave
speak
and
not
be
reprimanded
i
presume
it
is
no
idle
thought
you
have
in
mind
said
miran
looking
green
over
his
one
eye
narrow
in
its
it
has
to
do
with
money
ah
despite
your
foreign
accent
you
speak
with
a
pleasing
voice
you
are
the
golden
trumpet
of
mennirox
my
patron
god
speak
first
your
richness
must
swear
by
mennirox
that
you
will
under
no
circumstances
divulge
my
proposal
there
is
wealth
in
this
for
me
there
is
miran
glanced
at
his
clansmen
standing
there
patiently
apparently
oblivious
of
what
was
going
on
he
had
power
of
life
and
death
over
them
but
he
did
trust
them
he
said
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
i
thought
about
this
before
making
such
a
drastic
oath
could
you
meet
me
tonight
at
the
hour
of
the
wineglass
at
the
house
of
equality
and
could
you
perhaps
give
me
a
slight
hint
of
what
you
have
in
mind
the
answer
to
both
is
yes
my
proposal
has
to
do
with
the
dried
fish
that
you
carry
as
cargo
to
the
estoryans
there
is
another
thing
too
but
i
may
not
even
hint
at
it
until
i
have
your
oath
very
well
then
at
the
agreed
hour
fish
eh
i
must
be
off
time
is
money
you
know
get
going
boys
full
sails
green
hailed
a
passing
rickshaw
and
seated
himself
comfortably
in
it
as
assistant
majordomo
he
had
plenty
of
money
moreover
the
duke
and
duchess
would
have
been
outraged
if
he
had
lowered
their
prestige
by
walking
through
the
city
streets
his
vehicle
made
good
time
too
because
everybody
recognized
his
livery
the
scarlet
and
white
tricorn
hat
and
the
white
sleeveless
shirt
with
the
duke
heraldic
arms
on
its
chest
red
and
green
concentric
circles
pierced
by
a
black
arrow
the
street
led
always
downward
for
the
city
had
been
built
on
the
foothills
of
the
mountains
it
wandered
here
and
there
and
gave
green
plenty
of
time
to
think
the
trouble
was
he
thought
that
if
the
two
imprisoned
men
at
estorya
were
to
die
before
he
got
to
them
he
still
be
lost
he
had
no
idea
of
how
to
pilot
or
navigate
a
spaceship
he
been
a
passenger
on
a
freighter
when
it
had
unaccountably
blown
up
and
he
been
forced
to
leave
the
dying
vessel
in
one
of
those
automatic
castaway
emergency
shells
the
capsule
had
got
him
down
to
the
surface
of
this
planet
and
was
as
far
as
he
knew
still
up
in
the
hills
where
he
left
it
after
wandering
for
a
week
and
almost
starving
to
death
he
been
picked
up
by
some
peasants
they
had
turned
him
in
to
the
soldiers
of
a
nearby
garrison
thinking
he
must
be
a
runaway
slave
on
whom
they
collect
a
reward
taken
to
the
capital
city
of
quotz
green
had
almost
been
freed
because
there
was
no
record
of
his
being
anybody
property
but
his
tallness
blondness
and
inability
to
speak
the
local
language
had
convinced
his
captors
that
he
must
have
wandered
down
from
some
far
northern
country
therefore
if
he
was
a
slave
he
should
be
presto
changeo
he
was
and
he
put
in
six
months
in
a
quarry
and
a
year
as
a
dock
worker
then
the
duchess
had
chanced
to
see
him
on
the
streets
as
she
rode
by
and
he
been
transferred
to
the
castle
the
streets
were
alive
with
the
short
dark
stocky
natives
and
the
taller
slaves
the
former
wore
their
turbans
of
various
colors
indicating
their
status
and
trade
the
latter
wore
their
hats
occasionally
a
priest
in
his
high
conical
hat
hexagonal
spectacles
and
goatee
rode
by
wagons
and
rickshaws
drawn
by
men
or
by
big
powerful
dogs
went
by
merchants
stood
at
the
fronts
of
their
shops
and
hawked
their
wares
in
loud
voices
they
sold
cloth
grixtr
nut
parchment
knives
swords
helmets
drugs
books
on
magic
on
religion
on
travel
spices
perfumes
ink
rugs
highly
sugared
drinks
wine
beer
tonic
paintings
everything
that
went
to
make
up
their
civilization
butchers
stood
before
open
shops
where
dressed
fowl
deer
and
dogs
hung
dealers
in
birds
pointed
out
the
virtues
of
their
and
pets
for
the
thousandth
time
green
wondered
at
this
strange
planet
where
the
only
large
animals
were
men
dogs
grass
cats
a
small
deer
and
a
very
small
equine
in
fact
there
was
a
paucity
of
any
variety
of
animal
life
except
for
the
surprisingly
large
number
of
birds
it
was
this
scarcity
of
horses
and
oxen
he
supposed
that
helped
perpetuate
slavery
man
and
dog
had
to
provide
most
of
the
labor
no
doubt
there
was
an
explanation
for
all
this
but
it
must
be
buried
so
deep
in
this
people
forgotten
history
that
one
would
never
know
green
always
curious
wished
that
he
had
time
and
means
to
explore
but
he
did
he
might
as
well
resign
himself
to
keeping
a
whole
skin
and
to
getting
out
of
this
mess
as
fast
as
he
could
there
was
enough
to
do
merely
to
make
his
way
through
the
narrow
and
crowded
streets
he
had
to
display
his
baton
often
to
clear
a
path
though
when
he
approached
the
harbor
area
he
had
less
trouble
because
the
streets
were
much
wider
here
great
wagons
drawn
by
gangs
of
slaves
carried
huge
loads
to
or
from
the
ships
the
thoroughfares
had
to
be
broad
else
the
people
would
have
been
crushed
between
wagon
and
house
here
also
were
the
pens
where
the
lived
once
the
area
had
actually
been
an
enclosure
where
men
and
women
were
locked
up
for
the
night
but
the
walls
had
been
torn
down
and
new
houses
built
in
the
old
time
the
closest
earthly
parallel
green
could
think
of
for
these
edifices
was
a
housing
project
small
cottages
all
exactly
alike
set
in
military
columns
for
a
moment
he
considered
stopping
off
to
see
amra
then
decided
against
it
she
get
him
tied
up
in
an
argument
or
something
and
he
spend
too
much
time
trying
to
soothe
her
time
that
should
be
spent
at
the
marketplace
he
hated
scenes
whereas
amra
was
a
born
who
reveled
in
them
almost
wallowed
one
might
say
he
averted
his
eyes
from
the
pens
and
looked
at
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
the
walls
of
the
great
warehouses
towered
workmen
swarmed
around
them
and
cranes
operated
by
gangs
pushing
wheels
like
a
ship
capstan
raised
or
lowered
big
bundles
here
he
thought
was
a
business
opportunity
for
him
introduce
the
steam
engine
it
be
the
greatest
thing
that
ever
hit
this
planet
automobiles
could
replace
the
rickshaws
cranes
could
be
run
by
the
ships
themselves
could
have
their
wheels
powered
by
steam
or
perhaps
he
thought
rails
could
be
laid
across
the
xurdimur
and
locomotives
would
make
the
ships
obsolete
no
that
would
work
iron
rails
cost
too
much
and
the
savages
that
roved
over
the
grassy
plains
would
tear
them
up
and
forge
weapons
from
them
besides
every
time
he
suggested
to
the
duke
a
new
and
much
more
efficient
method
of
doing
something
he
ran
dead
into
the
brick
wall
of
tradition
and
custom
nothing
new
could
be
accepted
unless
the
gods
accepted
it
the
gods
will
was
interpreted
by
the
priests
the
priests
clutched
the
status
quo
as
tightly
as
a
hungry
infant
clutches
its
mother
breast
or
an
old
man
clings
to
his
property
green
could
make
a
fight
against
the
theocracy
but
he
did
feel
it
was
worth
while
to
become
a
martyr
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
behind
him
calling
his
name
alan
alan
he
hunched
his
shoulders
like
a
turtle
withdrawing
his
head
and
thought
desperately
for
a
moment
of
trying
to
ignore
the
voice
but
though
a
woman
it
was
powerful
and
penetrating
and
everybody
around
him
had
already
turned
to
see
its
owner
so
he
could
pretend
he
had
heard
it
alan
you
big
blond
hunk
of
man
stop
reluctantly
green
told
his
rickshaw
boy
to
turn
around
the
boy
grinning
did
so
like
everybody
else
along
the
harbor
front
he
knew
amra
and
was
familiar
with
her
relations
with
green
she
held
their
daughter
in
her
arms
cradled
against
her
magnificent
bosom
behind
her
stood
her
other
five
children
her
two
sons
by
the
duke
her
daughter
by
a
visiting
prince
her
son
by
the
captain
of
a
northerner
ship
her
daughter
by
a
temple
sculptor
her
rise
and
fall
and
slow
rise
again
was
told
in
the
children
around
her
the
tableau
embodied
an
outline
of
the
structure
of
the
planet
society
her
mother
had
been
a
northerner
slave
her
father
a
native
freeman
a
wheelwright
when
she
was
five
years
old
they
had
died
in
a
plague
she
had
been
transferred
to
the
pens
and
raised
by
her
aunt
when
she
was
fifteen
her
beauty
had
attracted
the
duke
and
he
had
installed
her
in
the
palace
there
she
gave
birth
to
his
two
sons
now
ten
and
eleven
who
would
soon
be
taken
away
from
her
and
raised
in
the
household
as
free
and
petted
servants
the
duke
had
married
the
present
duchess
several
years
after
his
liaison
with
amra
began
and
her
jealousy
had
forced
him
to
get
rid
of
amra
back
to
the
pens
she
had
gone
perhaps
the
duke
had
not
been
too
sad
to
see
her
go
for
living
with
her
was
like
living
with
a
hurricane
and
he
liked
peace
and
quiet
too
well
then
in
accordance
with
the
custom
she
had
been
recommended
by
the
duke
to
a
visiting
prince
the
prince
had
overstayed
his
leave
from
his
native
country
because
he
hated
to
part
with
her
and
the
duke
had
wanted
to
give
her
as
a
present
but
here
he
overstepped
his
legal
authority
slaves
had
certain
rights
a
woman
who
had
borne
a
citizen
a
child
could
not
be
shipped
away
or
sold
unless
she
gave
her
permission
amra
did
choose
to
go
so
the
sorrowing
prince
had
gone
home
though
not
without
leaving
a
memento
of
his
visit
behind
him
the
captain
of
a
ship
had
purchased
her
but
here
again
the
law
came
to
her
rescue
he
could
not
take
her
out
of
the
country
and
she
again
refused
to
leave
by
now
she
had
purchased
several
businesses
slaves
were
allowed
to
hold
property
and
even
have
slaves
of
their
own
and
she
knew
that
her
two
boys
by
the
duke
would
be
valuable
later
on
when
they
go
to
live
with
him
the
temple
sculptor
had
used
her
as
his
model
for
his
great
marble
statue
of
the
goddess
of
fertility
well
he
might
for
she
was
a
magnificent
creature
a
tall
woman
with
long
richly
auburn
hair
a
flawless
skin
large
russet
brown
eyes
a
mouth
as
red
and
ripe
as
a
plum
breasts
with
which
neither
child
nor
lover
could
find
fault
a
waist
amazingly
slender
considering
the
rest
of
her
curved
body
and
her
fruitfulness
her
long
legs
would
have
looked
good
on
an
earthwoman
and
were
even
more
outstanding
among
a
population
of
females
there
was
more
to
her
than
beauty
she
radiated
a
something
that
struck
every
male
at
first
sight
to
green
she
sometimes
seemed
to
be
a
violent
physical
event
perhaps
even
a
principle
of
nature
herself
there
were
times
when
green
felt
proud
because
she
had
picked
him
as
her
mate
chosen
him
when
he
was
a
newly
imported
slave
who
could
say
only
a
few
words
in
the
highly
irregular
agglutinative
tongue
but
there
were
times
when
he
felt
that
she
was
too
much
for
him
and
those
times
had
been
getting
too
frequent
lately
besides
he
felt
a
pang
whenever
he
saw
their
child
because
he
loved
it
and
dreaded
the
moment
when
he
would
have
to
leave
it
as
for
deserting
amra
he
was
sure
how
that
would
make
him
feel
undeniably
she
did
affect
him
but
then
so
did
a
blow
in
the
teeth
or
wine
in
the
blood
he
got
down
out
of
the
rickshaw
told
the
boy
to
wait
said
hello
honey
and
kissed
her
he
was
glad
she
was
a
slave
because
she
wear
a
when
he
kissed
the
duchess
he
was
always
annoyed
by
hers
she
refused
to
take
it
off
when
with
him
because
that
would
put
her
on
his
level
and
he
must
ever
forget
he
was
a
slave
it
was
perfectly
moral
for
her
to
take
a
bondsman
as
a
lover
but
not
a
freeman
and
she
was
nothing
if
not
moral
amra
return
kiss
was
passionate
part
of
which
was
the
vigor
of
asperity
you
not
fooling
me
she
said
you
meant
to
ride
right
by
kiss
the
children
what
the
matter
are
you
getting
tired
of
me
you
told
me
you
only
accepted
the
duchess
offer
because
it
meant
advancement
and
you
were
afraid
that
if
you
turned
her
down
find
an
excuse
to
kill
you
well
i
believed
you
you
anyway
but
i
wo
if
you
try
sneaking
by
without
seeing
me
the
matter
are
you
a
man
or
not
are
you
afraid
to
face
a
woman
shake
your
head
you
a
liar
do
forget
to
kiss
grizquetr
you
know
he
an
affectionate
boy
and
worships
you
and
it
absurd
to
say
that
in
your
country
grown
men
do
kiss
boys
that
old
not
in
your
country
what
a
strange
frigid
loveless
race
must
live
there
and
even
if
you
were
you
might
overlook
their
customs
to
show
some
tenderness
to
the
boy
come
on
back
to
our
house
and
i
bring
up
some
of
that
wonderful
chalousma
wine
that
came
in
the
other
day
out
of
the
cellar
what
was
a
ship
doing
in
your
cellar
he
said
and
he
whooped
with
laughter
by
all
the
gods
amra
i
know
it
been
two
days
since
seen
you
but
do
try
to
crowd
hours
conversation
into
ten
minutes
especially
your
kind
of
conversation
and
quit
scolding
me
in
front
of
the
children
you
know
it
bad
for
them
they
might
pick
up
your
attitude
of
contempt
for
the
head
of
the
house
i
contempt
why
i
worship
the
ground
you
walk
on
i
tell
them
continually
what
a
fine
man
you
are
though
it
rather
hard
to
convince
them
when
you
do
show
up
and
they
see
the
truth
still
there
was
only
one
way
to
handle
her
that
was
to
outtalk
outshout
outact
her
it
was
hard
going
especially
when
he
felt
so
tired
and
when
she
would
not
cooperate
with
him
but
would
fight
for
precedence
the
trouble
was
she
did
feel
any
respect
for
the
man
she
could
shut
up
so
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
dominate
her
this
he
accomplished
by
giving
her
a
big
squeeze
causing
the
baby
to
cry
because
she
was
pushed
in
too
tightly
between
the
two
of
them
then
while
amra
was
trying
to
soothe
the
baby
he
began
telling
her
what
had
happened
at
the
palace
she
was
silent
except
for
a
sharply
pointed
question
interjected
now
and
then
and
she
insisted
upon
hearing
the
details
of
everything
that
had
taken
place
everything
he
told
her
things
that
he
would
not
have
mentioned
before
children
two
years
ago
but
the
extremely
frank
and
uninhibited
society
of
the
slaves
had
freed
him
of
any
such
restraints
they
went
inside
amra
house
through
her
offices
where
six
of
her
clerks
and
secretaries
worked
through
the
living
rooms
proper
and
on
into
the
kitchen
she
rang
a
bell
and
told
inzax
a
pretty
little
blonde
to
go
into
the
cellar
and
bring
up
a
quart
of
chalousma
one
of
the
clerks
popped
his
head
in
the
kitchen
door
and
told
her
that
a
sheshyarvrenti
purser
of
an
andoonanarga
vessel
wanted
to
see
her
about
the
disposition
of
some
rare
birds
that
she
had
ordered
seven
months
before
he
would
deal
with
no
one
but
her
let
him
cool
his
heels
for
a
while
she
said
the
clerk
gulped
and
his
head
disappeared
green
took
paxi
his
daughter
and
played
with
her
while
amra
poured
their
wine
this
can
go
on
only
so
long
she
said
i
love
you
and
i
not
getting
the
attention
i
accustomed
to
you
should
find
some
pretense
to
break
off
with
the
duchess
i
a
vigorous
woman
who
needs
a
lot
of
love
i
want
you
here
green
had
nothing
to
lose
by
agreeing
with
her
since
he
planned
to
be
leaving
in
a
very
short
time
you
right
he
said
i
tell
her
as
soon
as
i
think
up
a
good
excuse
he
fingered
his
neck
at
the
place
where
a
headsman
ax
would
come
down
it
had
better
be
a
good
one
though
amra
seemed
to
glow
all
over
with
happiness
she
held
her
glass
up
and
said
here
to
the
duchess
may
demons
carry
her
off
you
better
be
careful
saying
that
before
the
children
you
know
that
if
they
innocently
repeated
that
to
someone
and
it
got
back
to
the
duchess
you
be
burned
in
the
next
witchhunt
not
my
children
she
scoffed
they
too
clever
they
take
after
their
mother
they
know
when
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
green
gulped
his
wine
and
stood
up
i
must
go
you
come
home
tonight
surely
the
duchess
will
let
you
out
one
night
a
week
not
one
single
night
and
i
ca
come
here
this
evening
because
to
meet
miran
the
merchant
at
the
house
of
equality
business
you
know
oh
i
know
you
dillydally
about
the
whole
matter
and
put
off
acting
for
one
reason
or
another
and
the
first
thing
you
know
years
will
go
by
and
if
this
keeps
up
i
be
dead
in
six
months
he
said
i
i
have
to
get
some
sleep
she
changed
instantly
from
anger
to
sympathy
poor
dear
why
do
you
forget
that
appointment
and
sleep
here
until
it
time
to
go
back
to
the
castle
i
send
a
messenger
to
miran
telling
him
you
sick
no
this
is
something
i
just
ca
pass
by
what
is
it
it
of
such
a
nature
that
telling
you
or
anybody
would
spoil
it
and
just
what
could
that
be
she
demanded
angry
again
it
concerns
some
woman
i
bet
my
problem
is
keeping
away
from
you
women
not
getting
into
more
trouble
no
it
just
that
miran
has
sworn
me
by
all
his
gods
to
keep
silent
and
of
course
i
could
think
of
breaking
a
vow
i
know
your
opinion
of
our
gods
she
said
well
go
along
with
you
but
i
warn
you
i
an
impatient
woman
i
give
you
a
week
to
work
on
the
duchess
then
i
launching
an
attack
myself
that
wo
be
necessary
he
said
he
kissed
her
and
the
children
and
left
he
congratulated
himself
on
having
delayed
amra
that
long
if
he
could
carry
out
his
scheme
in
a
week
he
was
lost
anyway
he
have
to
walk
away
from
the
city
and
out
onto
the
xurdimur
even
if
packs
of
wild
dogs
and
grass
cats
and
cannibalistic
men
and
god
knew
what
else
did
roam
the
grassy
plains
every
city
and
village
of
the
empire
had
its
house
of
equality
within
whose
walls
distinctions
of
every
type
were
abandoned
green
did
not
know
the
origin
of
the
institution
but
he
recognized
its
value
as
a
safety
valve
to
blow
off
the
extreme
social
pressure
put
on
every
class
here
the
slave
who
did
not
dare
open
his
mouth
in
the
outside
mundane
world
could
curse
his
master
to
his
face
and
go
unpunished
by
the
authorities
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
keep
the
master
from
retaliating
in
kind
for
the
slave
also
cast
off
his
legal
rights
when
he
entered
violence
was
not
unknown
here
though
it
was
infrequent
blood
shed
within
these
walls
did
not
theoretically
call
for
punishment
but
any
murderer
would
find
that
though
the
police
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
have
to
deal
with
the
slain
one
relatives
many
feuds
had
had
their
origin
and
end
here
green
had
excused
himself
after
the
evening
meal
saying
that
he
had
to
talk
to
miran
about
getting
some
spices
from
estorya
also
the
merchant
had
mentioned
that
on
his
last
trip
he
heard
that
a
band
of
estoryan
hunters
were
going
after
the
rare
and
beautiful
bird
and
that
he
might
find
some
for
sale
when
he
returned
there
zuni
face
lit
up
because
she
desired
a
bird
even
more
than
a
chance
to
annoy
her
husband
graciously
she
gave
green
permission
to
leave
inwardly
exultant
though
outwardly
pulling
a
long
face
that
was
supposed
to
suggest
his
sadness
at
having
to
leave
the
duchess
he
backed
out
of
the
dining
room
not
very
gracefully
for
alzo
chose
that
moment
to
refuse
to
get
out
of
green
path
green
tumbled
backward
sprawling
over
the
huge
mastiff
who
snarled
with
anger
and
trembled
with
hypocritical
indignation
and
bared
his
fangs
with
the
intention
of
tearing
green
apart
the
earthman
did
not
try
to
rise
because
he
did
not
want
to
give
alzo
an
excuse
for
jumping
him
instead
he
bared
his
own
teeth
and
snarled
back
the
hall
roared
with
laughter
and
the
duke
holding
his
sides
tears
running
from
his
bulging
eyes
rose
and
staggered
over
to
where
the
two
faced
each
other
on
all
fours
he
clutched
alzo
collar
and
dragged
him
away
meanwhile
choking
out
a
command
to
green
to
take
off
while
the
taking
off
was
good
green
swallowed
his
anger
thanked
the
duke
and
left
swearing
that
he
rip
the
hound
apart
some
day
with
his
bare
hands
the
earthman
left
for
the
house
of
equality
it
took
all
the
long
rickshaw
ride
to
the
temple
for
him
to
calm
down
the
great
central
room
with
its
ceiling
was
full
that
night
men
in
their
long
evening
kilts
and
women
in
masks
crowded
around
the
gambling
tables
the
bars
and
the
there
was
a
large
crowd
around
the
platform
on
which
two
dealers
in
wheat
were
slugging
it
out
to
work
off
resentment
arising
from
business
disputes
but
by
far
the
greatest
number
had
gathered
to
watch
a
match
his
left
hand
had
been
tied
to
his
side
and
she
had
been
armed
with
a
club
thus
equalized
they
been
given
the
word
to
go
to
it
so
far
the
man
had
had
the
worst
of
the
match
as
bloody
patches
on
his
head
and
bruises
on
his
arm
showed
if
he
could
get
the
club
away
from
her
he
had
the
right
to
do
what
he
wanted
to
her
but
if
she
could
break
his
free
arm
she
had
him
at
her
complete
mercy
green
avoided
the
stage
because
such
barbarous
doings
made
him
sick
looking
for
miran
he
finally
found
him
rolling
a
pair
of
dice
with
another
captain
this
fellow
wore
the
red
turban
and
black
robes
of
the
clan
axucan
he
had
just
lost
to
miran
and
was
paying
him
sixty
a
goodly
sum
even
for
a
miran
took
green
arm
something
he
never
have
done
outside
the
house
and
led
him
off
to
a
curtained
booth
where
they
could
get
as
much
privacy
as
they
wished
he
matched
green
for
drinks
green
lost
and
miran
ordered
a
large
pitcher
of
chalousma
nothing
but
the
best
for
yours
truly
whenever
someone
else
is
paying
miran
said
jovially
now
i
a
great
one
for
fun
but
here
primarily
for
business
so
let
have
your
proposal
at
once
if
you
please
first
i
must
have
your
solemn
oath
that
you
will
tell
absolutely
no
one
what
you
hear
in
this
booth
second
that
if
you
reject
my
idea
you
do
not
then
use
it
later
on
third
that
if
you
do
accept
you
will
never
attempt
later
on
to
kill
me
or
get
rid
of
me
and
thus
reap
the
profits
miran
face
had
been
blank
but
at
the
word
profits
it
twisted
into
many
folds
and
creases
all
expressive
of
joy
he
reached
into
the
huge
purse
he
carried
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
pulled
out
a
little
golden
idol
of
the
patron
deity
of
the
clan
effenycan
putting
his
right
hand
upon
its
ugly
head
he
lifted
his
left
and
said
i
swear
by
zaceffucanquanr
that
i
will
obey
your
wishes
in
this
matter
may
he
strike
me
with
lice
leprosy
lecher
disease
and
lightning
if
i
should
break
this
my
solemn
vow
satisfied
green
said
first
i
want
you
to
arrange
for
me
to
be
aboard
your
windroller
when
you
leave
for
estorya
miran
choked
on
his
wine
and
coughed
and
sputtered
until
green
pounded
his
back
i
do
not
ask
that
you
give
me
passage
now
here
my
idea
you
plan
to
be
taking
a
large
cargo
of
dried
fish
because
the
religion
requires
that
they
eat
them
at
every
meal
and
because
they
use
them
in
great
quantities
at
their
numerous
festivals
true
true
do
you
know
i
never
been
able
to
figure
out
why
they
should
worship
a
they
live
over
five
thousand
miles
from
the
sea
and
there
no
evidence
that
any
of
them
have
ever
been
to
the
sea
yet
they
demand
saltwater
fish
wo
use
the
fish
from
a
nearby
lake
there
many
mysteries
about
the
xurdimur
however
they
concern
us
now
do
you
know
that
the
estoryans
book
of
gods
places
much
more
in
freshly
killed
and
cooked
fish
than
in
smoked
fish
however
they
always
had
to
be
content
with
the
dried
fish
the
windrollers
brought
them
what
price
would
they
not
pay
for
living
miran
rubbed
his
palms
together
indeed
it
does
make
one
wonder
green
then
outlined
his
idea
miran
sat
stunned
not
at
the
audacity
or
originality
of
the
plan
but
because
it
was
so
obvious
that
he
wondered
why
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
had
ever
thought
of
it
he
said
so
green
drank
his
wine
and
said
i
suppose
that
people
wondered
the
same
when
the
first
wheel
or
bow
and
arrow
were
invented
so
obvious
yet
no
one
thought
of
them
until
then
let
me
get
this
straight
said
miran
you
want
me
to
buy
a
caravan
of
wagons
build
tanks
into
them
and
use
them
to
transport
ocean
fish
back
to
here
then
the
wagon
bodies
with
their
contents
will
be
lifted
onto
my
windroller
and
fitted
into
specially
prepared
racks
or
perhaps
holes
on
the
middeck
also
you
will
show
me
how
to
analyze
sea
water
so
that
its
formula
may
be
sold
to
the
estoryans
and
they
can
thus
keep
the
fish
alive
in
their
own
tanks
that
right
hmmm
miran
ran
his
fat
finger
over
his
hook
nose
and
the
square
gold
ornament
hanging
therefrom
his
single
eye
glared
at
green
the
other
was
covered
with
a
white
patch
to
hide
the
emptiness
left
after
a
ball
from
a
ving
musket
had
struck
it
it
four
weeks
until
the
very
last
day
on
which
i
can
set
sail
from
here
and
still
get
to
estorya
and
back
before
the
rains
come
it
just
barely
possible
to
have
the
tanks
built
get
them
convoyed
down
to
the
seashore
get
the
fish
in
and
bring
them
back
meantime
i
can
be
having
the
deck
altered
if
my
men
work
day
and
night
we
can
make
it
of
course
this
is
a
proposition
you
ca
possibly
keep
a
monopoly
on
the
idea
once
the
first
trip
is
over
too
many
people
are
bound
to
talk
and
the
other
captains
will
hear
of
it
i
know
do
teach
an
effenycan
to
suck
eggs
but
what
if
the
fish
should
die
green
shrugged
and
spread
out
his
palms
a
possibility
you
taking
a
tremendous
gamble
but
every
voyage
on
the
xurdimur
is
is
it
how
many
windrollers
come
back
or
how
many
can
boast
your
list
of
forty
successful
trips
not
many
said
miran
he
slumped
in
his
seat
brooding
over
his
goblet
of
wine
his
eye
sunk
in
ranges
of
fat
seemed
to
stare
through
green
the
earthman
pretended
indifference
though
his
heart
was
pounding
and
he
controlled
his
breathing
with
difficulty
you
asking
a
great
deal
miran
finally
said
if
the
duke
were
to
find
out
that
i
agreed
to
help
a
valued
slave
escape
i
be
tortured
in
a
refined
way
and
the
clan
effenycan
would
be
stripped
of
all
its
rights
to
sail
windrollers
and
would
probably
be
exiled
to
its
native
hills
or
else
would
have
to
take
to
piracy
and
that
despite
all
the
glamorous
stories
you
hear
is
not
a
very
profession
you
make
a
killing
in
estorya
true
but
when
i
think
of
what
the
duchess
will
do
when
she
discovers
you
fled
the
country
ow
ow
ow
there
no
reason
why
you
should
be
connected
with
my
disappearance
a
dozen
craft
leave
the
harbor
every
day
besides
for
all
she
know
i
gone
the
opposite
way
over
the
hills
and
to
the
ocean
or
to
the
hills
themselves
where
many
runaway
slaves
are
yes
but
i
have
to
return
to
tropat
and
my
clansmen
though
notoriously
when
sober
are
also
i
must
confess
notorious
drunkards
someone
be
sure
to
babble
in
the
taverns
i
dye
my
hair
black
cut
it
short
like
a
tzatlam
tribesman
and
sign
on
you
forget
that
you
have
to
belong
to
my
clan
in
order
to
be
a
crew
member
hmmm
well
what
about
this
routine
what
about
it
i
ca
propose
that
unless
you
done
something
spectacular
and
for
the
profit
of
the
clan
wait
can
you
play
any
musical
instrument
promptly
green
lied
oh
i
am
a
wonderful
harpist
when
i
play
i
can
soothe
a
hungry
grass
cat
into
lying
down
at
my
feet
and
licking
my
toes
with
pure
affection
excellent
though
it
would
not
be
an
affection
so
pure
since
it
is
well
known
that
the
grass
cat
considers
a
man
toes
a
great
delicacy
and
always
eats
them
first
even
before
the
eyes
listen
well
here
is
what
you
must
do
in
four
weeks
time
for
if
all
goes
well
or
all
goes
ill
we
set
sail
on
the
week
of
the
oak
the
day
of
the
sky
the
hour
of
the
lark
a
most
propitious
time
to
green
the
next
three
weeks
seemed
to
have
shifted
to
low
gear
they
crept
by
so
slowly
yet
they
should
have
raced
by
quickly
enough
so
full
of
schemes
and
plots
were
they
he
had
to
advise
miran
on
the
many
technical
details
involved
in
building
tanks
for
the
fish
he
had
to
keep
the
duchess
happy
an
increasingly
difficult
job
because
it
was
impossible
to
pretend
a
absorption
in
her
while
his
mind
desperately
looked
for
flaws
in
his
plans
found
oh
so
many
and
then
as
anxiously
sought
ways
of
repairing
them
nevertheless
he
knew
it
was
vital
that
he
not
displease
or
bore
her
prison
would
forever
ruin
his
chances
worst
of
all
amra
was
getting
suspicious
you
trying
to
conceal
something
from
me
she
told
green
you
ought
to
know
better
i
can
tell
when
a
man
is
deceiving
me
something
about
the
voice
the
eyes
the
way
he
makes
love
though
you
been
doing
very
little
of
that
what
are
you
plotting
i
assure
you
it
simply
that
i
very
tired
he
said
sharply
all
i
want
is
some
peace
and
quiet
a
little
rest
and
a
little
privacy
now
and
then
do
try
to
tell
me
that
all
she
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
and
squinted
at
him
managing
somehow
even
in
this
grotesque
attitude
to
look
ravishingly
beautiful
suddenly
she
said
you
would
be
thinking
of
running
away
would
you
for
a
second
he
became
pale
damn
the
woman
anyway
do
be
ridiculous
he
said
trying
hard
to
keep
his
voice
from
cracking
i
too
much
aware
of
the
penalties
if
i
were
caught
besides
why
should
i
want
to
run
away
you
are
the
most
desirable
woman
i
ever
known
this
was
the
truth
though
you
not
the
easiest
one
in
the
world
to
live
with
a
master
understatement
i
would
have
gotten
no
place
without
you
true
but
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
on
this
barbarous
world
and
it
is
unthinkable
that
i
would
want
to
leave
you
inexpressible
yes
but
not
unthinkable
he
could
take
her
with
him
for
the
simple
reason
that
even
if
she
would
go
she
would
never
fit
in
his
life
on
earth
she
be
absolutely
unhappy
moreover
she
not
go
anyway
because
she
refuse
to
abandon
her
children
and
would
try
to
take
them
along
thus
wrecking
all
his
escape
plans
he
might
just
as
well
hire
a
brass
band
and
march
behind
it
out
of
the
city
and
onto
the
windroller
in
the
light
of
high
noon
nevertheless
his
conscience
troubled
him
if
it
was
painful
to
leave
amra
it
was
hell
to
leave
paxi
his
daughter
for
days
he
had
considered
taking
her
along
with
him
but
eventually
abandoned
the
idea
trying
to
steal
her
from
under
amra
fiercely
watchful
gaze
was
almost
impossible
moreover
paxi
would
miss
her
mother
terribly
and
he
had
no
business
exposing
the
baby
to
the
risks
of
the
voyage
which
were
many
amra
would
be
doubly
hurt
losing
him
would
be
bad
enough
but
to
lose
paxi
also
no
he
could
do
that
to
her
the
outcome
of
this
conversation
with
her
was
that
she
apparently
dropped
her
suspicions
at
least
she
never
spoke
of
them
again
he
was
glad
of
that
for
it
was
impossible
to
keep
entirely
hidden
his
connection
with
the
mysterious
actions
of
miran
the
merchant
the
whole
city
knew
something
was
up
there
was
undoubtedly
a
lot
of
money
tied
up
with
this
deal
of
the
wagon
caravan
going
to
the
seashore
but
what
did
it
all
mean
neither
miran
nor
green
would
say
a
word
and
while
the
duke
and
duchess
might
have
used
their
authority
to
get
the
information
from
their
slave
the
duke
made
no
move
miran
had
promised
to
let
him
in
on
a
share
of
the
profits
provided
he
gave
the
merchant
a
free
hand
and
asked
no
questions
the
duke
was
quite
content
he
planned
on
spending
the
money
to
increase
his
collection
of
glass
birds
he
had
ten
large
rooms
of
the
castle
glittering
with
his
fantastic
aviary
shining
silent
and
grotesquely
beautiful
all
products
of
the
of
the
fabulous
city
of
metzva
moosh
far
far
away
across
the
grassy
sea
of
the
xurdimur
green
was
present
when
the
duke
talked
to
miran
about
it
now
captain
you
must
understand
just
exactly
what
i
do
want
warned
the
ruler
lifting
a
finger
to
emphasize
the
seriousness
of
his
words
his
eyes
usually
in
their
fat
had
widened
to
reveal
large
brown
and
soulful
orbs
the
passion
for
his
hobby
shone
forth
nothing
good
chalousma
wine
his
wife
the
torture
of
a
heretic
or
runaway
slave
could
make
him
quiver
and
glitter
with
delight
as
much
as
the
thought
of
the
exquisitely
wrought
image
of
a
metzva
moosh
bird
i
want
two
or
three
but
no
more
because
i
ca
afford
more
all
made
by
izan
yushwa
the
greatest
of
the
i
particularly
like
any
modeled
after
the
but
when
i
was
last
in
estorya
i
heard
that
izan
yushwa
was
dying
said
miran
excellent
excellent
cried
the
duke
that
will
make
everything
recently
created
by
him
even
more
valuable
if
he
is
dead
now
it
is
probable
that
the
estoryans
who
control
the
export
of
the
mooshans
will
be
putting
a
high
price
on
anything
of
his
that
comes
their
way
that
means
that
bidding
will
be
high
during
the
festival
and
that
you
must
outbid
any
prospective
buyers
by
all
means
do
so
pay
any
price
for
i
must
have
something
created
by
him
in
his
last
days
the
duke
green
realized
was
so
eager
because
of
the
belief
that
a
part
of
a
dying
artist
soul
entered
into
his
latest
creations
when
he
died
these
were
called
and
brought
ten
times
as
much
as
anything
else
even
if
the
conception
and
execution
were
inferior
to
previous
works
sourly
miran
said
but
you
have
given
me
no
money
to
buy
your
birds
of
course
not
you
will
lend
me
the
sum
buy
them
yourself
and
when
you
come
back
with
them
i
will
raise
the
money
to
repay
you
miran
did
seem
too
happy
but
green
knew
that
the
fat
merchant
was
already
planning
to
charge
the
duke
double
the
purchase
price
as
for
green
he
liked
to
see
a
man
interested
in
a
hobby
but
he
was
disgusted
because
taxes
would
now
be
raised
in
order
to
allow
the
duke
to
add
to
his
collection
the
duchess
bored
as
usual
by
her
husband
conversation
suddenly
said
honey
let
go
hunting
next
weekend
i
been
so
restless
lately
so
unable
to
sleep
nights
i
think
i
been
cooped
up
too
long
in
this
dismal
old
place
my
digestion
has
been
so
sluggish
lately
i
think
i
need
the
exercise
and
the
fresh
air
and
she
went
into
vivid
detail
about
certain
aspects
of
her
gastrointestinal
troubles
the
earthman
who
thought
he
was
hardened
to
this
people
custom
of
dwelling
on
such
matters
turned
green
at
the
suggestion
of
a
hunt
the
duke
did
exactly
groan
but
his
eyes
rolled
upward
in
supplication
to
the
gods
until
he
had
reached
the
age
of
thirty
he
had
enjoyed
a
good
hunt
but
like
most
men
of
his
culture
he
rapidly
put
on
flesh
after
thirty
and
became
as
sedentary
as
possible
the
belief
was
that
fat
increased
a
man
life
span
also
a
big
belly
and
double
chin
were
signs
of
aristocratic
blood
and
a
full
purse
unfortunately
along
with
this
came
an
inevitable
decline
in
vigor
which
coupled
with
the
marriages
that
their
society
expected
of
them
had
given
birth
to
another
institution
the
slave
male
companion
of
the
rich
man
young
wife
it
was
toward
green
that
the
duke
looked
why
not
let
him
conduct
the
hunt
he
suggested
hopefully
i
so
much
business
to
take
care
of
like
sitting
on
your
fat
cushion
and
contemplating
your
glass
birds
she
said
no
very
well
he
said
resignedly
i
a
slave
in
the
to
be
executed
for
striking
a
foreman
we
use
him
as
the
quarry
but
i
think
we
ought
to
give
him
two
weeks
to
build
up
his
wind
and
legs
otherwise
it
would
hardly
be
sporting
you
know
the
duchess
frowned
no
i
getting
bored
i
ca
stand
this
inaction
any
longer
she
shot
a
glance
at
green
he
felt
his
stomach
muscles
contracting
evidently
she
noticed
his
lukewarm
interest
in
her
this
hunt
was
partly
to
suggest
to
him
that
he
be
meeting
a
like
fate
unless
he
perked
up
and
began
to
be
more
entertaining
it
was
that
thought
that
made
his
heart
sink
it
was
that
next
weekend
was
when
miran
windroller
raised
sail
and
when
he
planned
to
be
aboard
it
now
he
be
gone
conducting
the
hunting
party
up
in
the
hills
green
looked
appealingly
at
miran
but
the
merchant
shoulders
rose
beneath
the
yellow
robe
as
if
to
say
what
can
i
do
he
was
right
miran
could
suggest
that
he
too
go
along
on
the
hunt
and
thus
give
green
a
chance
to
slip
aboard
afterward
the
day
on
which
the
of
was
scheduled
to
leave
the
windbreak
was
absolutely
the
last
date
on
which
it
could
set
sail
he
could
afford
to
take
the
chance
of
being
caught
in
the
rains
in
the
middle
of
the
vast
plains
all
the
next
day
green
was
too
busy
setting
up
the
schedule
of
the
hunting
party
to
have
time
to
be
gloomy
but
when
night
came
he
seemed
to
fold
up
inside
himself
could
he
pretend
to
be
sick
too
and
be
left
behind
when
the
party
set
out
no
for
they
would
at
once
assume
that
he
had
been
possessed
by
a
demon
and
would
pack
him
off
to
the
temple
of
apoquoz
god
of
healing
there
he
be
under
lock
and
key
until
he
proved
himself
healthy
the
terrible
part
about
going
to
the
temple
of
apoquoz
was
that
it
made
death
almost
inevitable
if
you
did
die
of
your
own
disease
you
caught
somebody
else
green
was
worried
about
catching
any
of
the
many
diseases
he
be
exposed
to
in
the
temple
like
all
men
of
terrestrial
descent
he
carried
in
his
body
a
surgically
implanted
protoplasmic
entity
which
automatically
analyzed
any
invading
microscopic
organisms
viruses
and
manufactured
antibodies
to
combat
them
it
lived
in
the
space
created
by
the
removal
of
his
appendix
when
working
to
fulfill
its
mission
it
demanded
food
and
radiated
a
heat
that
assured
its
host
of
its
heartening
presence
an
increased
appetite
plus
a
slight
fever
indicated
that
it
was
killing
off
the
disease
and
that
within
several
hours
it
would
successfully
repel
any
boarders
in
the
two
years
green
had
been
on
the
planet
it
had
had
to
attack
at
least
forty
times
green
calculated
that
he
would
have
been
dead
each
and
every
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
symbiote
knowing
this
did
help
him
if
he
played
sick
he
be
locked
up
and
could
get
on
the
if
he
went
on
the
hunting
party
he
missed
the
boat
too
suppose
he
were
to
disappear
the
night
before
the
party
to
hide
on
the
windroller
while
the
castle
vainly
looked
for
him
not
very
likely
the
first
thing
that
would
occur
to
zuni
would
be
to
order
the
windbreak
closed
and
all
searched
for
a
possible
stowaway
and
if
that
happened
miran
would
be
so
delayed
that
it
was
unlikely
he
sail
even
if
he
green
hid
in
miran
cabin
where
he
would
probably
be
safe
there
would
still
be
the
inevitable
and
totally
frustrating
delay
then
why
not
disappear
several
days
earlier
so
that
miran
could
have
time
to
reload
his
cargo
he
see
the
merchant
tomorrow
if
miran
fell
in
with
his
plans
green
would
disappear
four
nights
from
this
very
night
which
would
leave
three
days
for
the
windroller
to
be
emptied
and
reloaded
fortunately
the
tanks
would
have
to
be
taken
off
because
any
fool
could
see
that
the
runaway
was
hiding
at
the
bottom
among
the
fish
much
relieved
that
he
at
least
had
a
way
open
if
a
very
perilous
one
green
relaxed
he
was
sitting
on
a
bench
along
a
walk
on
top
of
one
of
the
castle
walls
the
sky
was
blazingly
beautiful
with
stars
larger
than
any
seen
from
earth
the
great
moon
and
the
small
moon
had
risen
the
larger
had
just
cleared
the
eastern
horizon
and
the
lesser
one
was
just
past
the
zenith
mingled
moonwash
and
starwash
softened
the
grimness
and
ugliness
of
the
city
below
him
and
laved
it
in
a
flood
of
romance
and
glamour
most
of
quotz
was
unlighted
for
the
streets
had
no
lamps
and
the
windows
were
shut
up
tight
against
thieves
vampires
and
demons
occasionally
the
torchflares
of
the
servants
of
a
drunken
noble
or
rich
man
moved
down
the
dark
canyons
between
the
towering
overhanging
houses
beyond
the
city
was
the
amphitheater
formed
by
the
hills
curving
out
to
the
north
and
the
great
brick
wall
built
to
continue
the
natural
windbreak
a
wide
opening
had
been
left
so
that
the
their
sails
furled
could
be
towed
in
or
out
past
this
the
great
plain
suddenly
began
as
if
the
hand
of
some
immense
landscaper
had
pressed
the
hills
flat
and
declared
that
from
here
on
there
would
be
no
unevennesses
westward
lay
the
incredibly
level
stretch
of
the
grassy
ground
of
the
xurdimur
ten
thousand
miles
straight
across
flat
as
a
table
top
broken
only
here
and
there
by
clumps
of
forests
ruins
of
cities
waterholes
the
tents
of
the
nomadic
savages
herds
of
wild
animals
packs
of
grass
cats
and
dire
dogs
and
the
mysterious
and
undoubtedly
imaginary
roaming
islands
great
clumps
of
rock
and
dirt
that
legend
said
slid
of
their
own
volition
over
the
plains
how
like
this
planet
he
thought
that
the
greatest
peril
to
navigation
should
be
one
that
existed
only
in
the
heads
of
the
inhabitants
the
xurdimur
was
a
fabulous
phenomenon
without
parallel
on
none
of
the
many
planets
that
earthmen
had
discovered
was
there
anything
similar
how
he
wondered
could
the
plain
keep
its
smoothness
when
there
was
always
dirt
running
on
to
it
from
the
eroding
hills
and
mountains
that
ringed
it
the
rains
too
should
have
done
much
to
wear
it
away
unevenly
of
course
the
grass
that
grew
all
over
it
was
long
and
had
very
tough
roots
and
if
what
he
had
been
told
was
true
beneath
the
vegetation
was
one
mass
of
inextricably
tangled
roots
that
held
the
soil
together
there
was
another
thing
to
consider
though
the
winds
that
blew
all
the
way
across
the
xurdimur
and
furnished
propulsion
for
the
wheeled
sailing
craft
to
have
winds
you
must
have
pressure
differentials
which
were
usually
caused
by
heat
differentials
although
the
xurdimur
was
ringed
by
mountains
there
were
no
large
eminences
on
it
for
ten
thousand
miles
nothing
to
replenish
the
currents
of
air
or
so
it
seemed
to
his
limited
knowledge
of
meteorology
though
he
did
wonder
how
the
trade
winds
that
swept
earth
seas
managed
to
keep
going
for
so
many
thousands
of
leagues
just
on
their
original
impetus
or
did
they
get
boosts
he
did
know
what
he
did
know
was
that
the
xurdimur
was
a
thing
that
be
yet
the
very
presence
of
men
here
was
just
as
amazing
just
as
preposterous
homo
sapiens
was
scattered
throughout
the
galaxy
everywhere
that
the
earthmen
had
gone
they
had
found
that
about
every
fourth
inhabitable
planet
was
populated
by
men
of
their
species
the
proof
lay
not
just
in
the
outward
physical
resemblance
of
terrestrial
and
it
lay
in
their
ability
to
breed
earthman
sirian
albirean
vegan
it
made
no
difference
their
men
could
have
children
by
the
women
of
other
planets
naturally
there
had
been
many
theories
to
account
for
this
fact
all
had
as
a
common
basis
the
assumption
that
homo
sapiens
had
sometime
somewhere
in
the
very
remote
past
originated
on
one
planet
and
then
had
spread
out
over
the
galaxy
from
it
and
somehow
space
travel
had
been
lost
and
each
race
had
gone
back
to
savagery
only
to
begin
again
the
long
hard
struggle
toward
civilization
and
the
of
spaceships
why
no
one
knew
one
could
only
guess
there
was
the
problem
of
language
it
might
seem
that
if
man
had
come
from
a
common
birthplace
he
would
at
least
have
kept
a
trace
of
his
home
language
and
that
the
linguists
could
break
down
the
development
of
tongue
and
link
one
planet
to
another
through
it
but
no
every
world
had
its
own
tower
of
babel
its
own
ten
thousand
languages
the
terrestrial
scientist
might
trace
russian
and
english
and
swedish
and
lithuanian
and
persian
and
hindustani
back
to
a
but
he
had
never
found
on
any
other
planet
a
language
which
he
could
say
had
also
derived
from
the
aryan
ursprache
green
mind
wandered
to
the
two
earthmen
now
imprisoned
in
the
city
of
estorya
he
hoped
they
were
being
treated
badly
they
could
be
in
horrible
pain
at
this
very
moment
if
the
priests
felt
like
subjecting
them
to
a
little
thinking
of
torture
led
him
to
sit
up
a
little
straighter
and
to
stretch
his
arms
and
legs
in
an
hour
he
was
supposed
to
meet
the
duchess
to
do
that
he
had
to
go
through
the
supposedly
secret
door
in
the
wall
of
the
turret
at
the
northern
end
of
the
walk
up
a
stairway
through
a
passage
between
the
walls
and
so
to
the
apartments
there
one
of
the
would
usher
him
into
presence
and
then
would
try
to
eavesdrop
so
she
could
report
to
the
duke
later
on
zuni
and
green
were
supposed
to
know
about
this
but
were
to
pretend
that
she
was
their
trusted
confidante
when
the
great
bell
of
the
temple
of
the
god
of
time
grooza
struck
green
would
rise
from
his
bench
and
go
to
what
he
now
thought
of
as
a
wearisome
chore
if
that
woman
could
only
be
interested
in
talking
of
something
else
besides
her
complexion
or
digestion
or
idle
palace
gossip
it
would
be
so
bad
but
no
she
chattered
on
and
on
and
green
would
get
increasingly
sleepy
yet
would
not
dare
drop
off
for
fear
of
irreparably
offending
her
and
to
do
that
the
lesser
moon
had
touched
the
western
horizon
and
the
greater
was
nearing
the
zenith
when
green
awoke
and
jumped
to
his
feet
swearing
in
sheer
terror
he
fallen
asleep
and
kept
zuni
waiting
my
god
what
she
say
he
said
aloud
what
i
tell
her
you
need
tell
me
anything
came
her
angry
retort
from
very
close
by
he
started
and
whirled
around
and
saw
that
she
been
standing
behind
him
she
was
wrapped
in
a
robe
but
her
pale
face
gleamed
from
beneath
the
overhanging
hood
and
her
mouth
was
opened
white
teeth
flashed
as
she
began
accusing
him
of
not
loving
her
of
being
bored
by
her
of
loving
some
other
woman
probably
a
slave
girl
a
lazy
brainless
emptily
pretty
wench
if
his
situation
had
been
so
serious
green
would
have
smiled
at
her
he
tried
to
dam
the
flood
but
to
no
avail
she
screeched
at
him
to
shut
up
and
when
he
put
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
said
shhh
she
replied
by
raising
her
voice
even
more
you
know
you
not
supposed
to
be
out
of
your
rooms
after
dark
unless
the
duke
is
along
he
said
taking
her
elbow
and
attempting
to
steer
her
down
the
walk
toward
the
secret
door
if
the
guards
see
you
there
be
trouble
bad
trouble
let
go
unfortunately
the
guards
did
see
them
torches
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
below
the
walk
and
iron
helmets
and
cuirasses
gleamed
green
tried
to
urge
her
on
faster
for
there
was
still
time
to
make
it
to
the
door
she
jerked
her
arm
loose
and
shouted
take
your
filthy
hands
off
me
you
northern
slave
the
duchess
of
tropat
does
allow
herself
to
be
pushed
around
by
a
blond
beast
damn
it
he
snarled
and
he
shoved
her
you
stupid
get
going
wo
be
tortured
if
they
find
us
together
zuni
jerked
away
her
face
twisted
and
her
mouth
worked
soundlessly
she
finally
gasped
yourself
suddenly
she
began
screaming
before
he
could
clamp
his
hand
over
her
mouth
she
dashed
past
him
and
toward
the
steps
it
was
then
that
he
came
out
of
his
paralysis
and
ran
not
after
her
which
he
knew
was
useless
but
toward
the
secret
door
all
was
up
it
was
absolutely
no
use
trying
to
explain
to
the
guards
the
situation
had
now
entered
a
conventional
phase
she
would
tell
the
guards
that
he
had
come
into
her
room
through
some
unknown
means
which
would
be
found
out
later
and
had
dragged
her
out
onto
the
walk
apparently
with
the
intention
of
violating
her
why
he
should
pick
a
public
place
when
he
already
had
the
privacy
of
her
rooms
would
not
be
asked
and
the
guards
though
they
would
know
what
really
had
happened
would
pretend
to
believe
her
and
would
furiously
seize
him
and
drag
him
off
to
the
dungeons
the
absurd
thing
about
it
was
that
within
a
few
days
the
whole
city
including
zuni
herself
would
believe
that
her
story
was
true
by
the
time
he
been
executed
they
would
hate
his
guts
and
the
lot
of
all
the
slaves
would
be
miserable
for
a
while
because
they
would
share
his
blame
green
had
no
intention
of
being
seized
flight
was
an
admission
of
guilt
but
it
made
no
difference
now
he
ran
through
the
secret
door
shut
and
bolted
it
and
raced
up
the
steps
that
led
to
her
apartments
the
guards
would
have
to
take
the
long
way
around
he
had
at
least
two
minutes
before
they
could
unlock
the
two
doors
of
the
to
her
quarters
explain
to
the
guards
just
outside
them
what
had
happened
and
begin
a
search
for
him
as
for
him
he
was
running
like
a
rabbit
but
he
was
thinking
like
a
fox
having
known
that
just
such
a
situation
might
arise
he
had
long
ago
planned
in
detail
several
possible
courses
of
action
now
he
chose
the
likeliest
one
and
began
acting
efficiently
if
not
smoothly
the
staircase
was
a
narrow
corkscrew
with
room
for
only
one
person
at
a
time
to
go
up
he
ran
up
it
so
fast
that
he
got
dizzy
with
the
turns
he
reeled
and
had
trouble
keeping
from
falling
to
his
left
when
he
did
arrive
at
its
top
nevertheless
he
did
not
pause
to
catch
breath
or
balance
but
pulled
the
lever
that
would
make
the
door
swing
out
he
burst
through
it
no
one
there
thank
god
he
stopped
for
a
moment
listened
to
make
sure
nobody
was
in
the
next
room
then
pushed
on
a
boss
set
in
a
pattern
of
bronze
protuberances
which
was
connected
with
the
mechanism
that
operated
the
secret
door
the
section
of
wall
swung
back
silently
until
it
was
flush
with
the
rest
and
quite
indistinguishable
he
then
twisted
the
knob
so
the
door
could
be
opened
from
the
other
side
green
took
time
to
give
fervent
thanks
to
the
builders
of
the
castle
who
had
prepared
this
device
for
the
owners
to
hide
within
in
case
of
a
successful
invasion
or
revolt
if
it
had
not
been
there
he
could
not
have
escaped
escaped
he
only
put
off
his
inevitable
capture
but
he
intended
to
run
as
long
as
he
could
and
then
fight
until
they
were
forced
to
kill
him
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
find
a
weapon
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
so
familiar
with
zuni
rooms
that
he
knew
exactly
where
he
could
get
what
he
wanted
he
walked
through
two
large
rooms
making
his
way
easily
even
through
the
feeble
duskish
light
that
the
few
oil
lamps
and
candles
furnished
hanging
from
the
wall
of
the
third
room
was
a
saber
made
of
the
best
steel
obtainable
on
this
planet
and
fashioned
by
the
greatest
smiths
the
swordwrights
of
faraway
and
almost
legendary
talamasko
the
blade
was
a
gift
from
zuni
father
on
the
occasion
of
her
wedding
to
the
duke
it
was
supposed
to
be
given
by
zuni
to
her
eldest
son
when
he
came
of
age
the
hilt
had
a
guard
on
which
was
inscribed
in
gold
the
motto
hell
than
he
fastened
sword
and
scabbard
to
an
iron
ring
on
his
broad
leather
belt
went
to
a
luxurious
dressing
table
pulled
open
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
stiletto
this
he
stuck
through
his
belt
also
a
huge
flintlock
pistol
with
a
butt
he
loaded
it
with
powder
and
an
iron
ball
he
found
in
a
compartment
and
put
ammunition
in
a
bag
which
he
also
hung
from
his
belt
then
well
armed
he
walked
out
onto
the
balcony
to
take
a
quick
view
of
the
situation
three
stories
below
him
was
the
walk
which
he
had
left
a
few
minutes
before
many
soldiers
and
zuni
were
standing
there
all
looking
up
as
his
face
came
into
sight
visible
in
the
moonlight
and
the
flares
of
their
torches
a
shout
arose
several
of
the
musket
men
raised
their
weapons
but
zuni
cried
out
for
them
to
hold
their
fire
she
wanted
him
alive
green
skin
prickled
at
the
vindictiveness
in
her
voice
and
at
the
vision
of
what
she
was
probably
planning
for
him
he
been
forced
to
see
too
many
tortures
and
public
executions
not
to
know
exactly
what
she
designed
for
him
suddenly
overcome
with
rage
that
she
could
be
so
treacherous
and
brutal
a
rage
perhaps
flavored
with
because
he
had
made
love
to
her
he
aimed
his
pistol
at
her
there
was
a
click
as
the
hammer
struck
the
flint
a
spark
a
whoosh
as
the
powder
burnt
in
the
pan
a
loud
bang
and
a
cloud
of
black
smoke
when
the
fumes
cleared
away
he
saw
that
everybody
including
the
duchess
was
running
for
cover
naturally
he
missed
for
he
had
almost
no
practice
with
the
pistols
being
a
slave
even
if
he
been
well
trained
he
probably
would
not
have
struck
his
mark
so
inaccurate
were
the
weapons
while
green
was
reloading
he
heard
a
shout
from
above
looking
up
he
saw
the
duke
round
face
pale
in
the
moonlight
hanging
over
the
railing
of
the
balcony
above
he
raised
his
empty
pistol
and
the
duke
squalling
with
fear
ran
back
into
his
quarters
green
laughed
and
said
to
himself
that
even
if
he
was
killed
now
he
would
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
shamed
the
duke
who
was
always
boasting
about
his
bravery
in
battle
of
course
his
action
had
also
made
it
absolutely
necessary
for
the
duke
to
have
him
killed
at
once
so
that
green
could
not
tell
others
that
he
put
him
to
flight
he
grinned
crookedly
what
would
happen
when
the
soldiers
received
the
duke
orders
directly
contradicting
the
duchess
the
poor
fellows
would
scarcely
know
what
to
do
the
man
commands
would
of
course
supersede
the
woman
but
the
woman
would
be
furious
and
she
would
later
on
find
some
means
of
punishing
those
who
did
succeed
in
killing
green
it
was
at
that
moment
that
he
lost
his
smile
and
paled
with
fright
a
loud
barking
nearby
not
outside
the
apartment
door
but
he
cursed
and
whirled
around
just
in
time
to
see
the
large
body
launched
toward
his
throat
the
white
fangs
flashing
and
the
green
fire
shining
from
its
eyes
as
the
moonlight
struck
them
even
in
that
moment
of
panic
he
realized
that
he
forgotten
the
small
door
set
inside
the
larger
one
so
that
alzo
could
have
admittance
at
any
time
and
if
the
big
dog
could
get
through
then
soldiers
could
also
crawl
through
instinctively
he
thrust
out
the
pistol
and
squeezed
the
trigger
it
did
not
go
off
for
there
was
no
powder
in
the
pan
but
the
barrel
did
jam
into
the
great
mouth
and
deflect
alzo
from
his
target
throat
even
so
green
was
knocked
backward
by
the
impact
and
he
felt
the
sharp
teeth
clamping
down
on
his
wrist
those
jaws
were
capable
of
biting
through
his
arm
and
though
he
felt
no
pain
he
was
sickened
by
the
thought
that
he
see
a
bloody
stump
when
alzo
danced
away
from
him
however
his
arm
though
dripping
blood
from
large
gashes
was
not
hurt
badly
the
dog
had
been
deterred
by
the
barrel
shoved
down
his
throat
choking
him
so
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
for
the
moment
but
getting
clear
of
it
the
pistol
clattered
on
the
iron
floor
of
the
balcony
alzo
shook
his
head
unaware
in
his
frenzy
that
he
was
rid
of
the
weapon
green
leaped
up
from
the
sitting
position
into
which
alzo
charge
had
flung
him
against
the
railing
snarling
as
viciously
as
the
dog
he
braced
his
feet
against
the
juncture
of
the
floor
and
railing
and
launched
himself
straight
out
at
the
same
time
the
canine
jumped
they
met
head
on
green
skull
driving
into
the
open
mouth
and
knocking
the
dog
backward
because
his
impetus
was
greater
though
the
huge
jaws
bit
down
at
his
scalp
they
snapped
on
air
and
the
animal
fell
to
one
side
growling
green
seized
hold
of
the
long
tail
rolled
away
from
the
teeth
now
snapping
at
his
ankles
and
jerked
at
the
tail
so
that
the
dog
would
swing
away
from
him
he
rose
to
one
knee
pushed
the
dog
away
from
him
though
still
keeping
his
frenzied
grip
with
two
hands
and
jumped
to
his
feet
frantically
the
animal
twisted
around
and
bit
at
the
imprisoning
hands
but
he
succeeded
only
in
biting
his
own
flank
howling
in
anguish
he
tried
to
lunge
away
green
making
a
supreme
effort
raised
the
tail
in
the
air
naturally
the
body
came
along
with
it
at
the
same
time
he
from
the
animal
bent
forward
and
with
a
convulsive
motion
using
his
bowed
back
as
a
lever
threw
alzo
over
his
head
the
terrible
growling
suddenly
changed
to
a
howl
of
despair
as
alzo
flew
over
the
railing
and
out
into
the
air
above
the
walk
green
leaning
over
to
watch
him
did
not
feel
sorry
for
him
he
was
exultant
he
hated
that
dog
and
had
dreamed
of
just
such
a
moment
alzo
yelping
was
cut
off
as
he
struck
the
parapet
beside
the
walk
bounced
off
and
then
dropped
from
view
into
the
depths
beyond
strength
had
been
greater
than
he
suspected
for
he
had
thought
only
to
toss
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
pound
beast
over
the
railing
there
was
no
time
for
savoring
triumph
if
the
dog
could
get
through
that
little
door
so
could
soldiers
he
ran
out
into
the
room
expecting
that
at
least
a
dozen
men
had
crawled
in
but
there
was
no
one
why
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
was
that
they
were
afraid
knowing
that
if
he
at
once
dispatched
the
dog
he
could
leisurely
knock
them
over
the
head
in
their
helpless
position
the
door
shook
beneath
a
mighty
impact
they
taken
the
wiser
if
the
less
courageous
course
of
battering
rams
green
loaded
his
pistol
spilling
the
powder
at
his
first
attempt
to
prime
the
pan
because
his
hands
shook
so
he
fired
and
a
large
hole
appeared
in
the
wood
however
part
of
the
ball
also
stuck
out
for
the
door
was
planked
thickly
against
just
such
weapons
the
battering
ceased
and
he
heard
a
thud
as
the
ram
was
dropped
on
the
floor
in
hasty
retreat
he
smiled
as
they
were
still
operating
under
the
duchess
instructions
to
take
him
alive
not
yet
countermanded
by
the
duke
they
would
not
want
to
face
pistol
fire
with
only
swords
in
hand
and
in
the
first
reflex
to
the
shot
they
undoubtedly
forgotten
that
a
ball
could
penetrate
the
wood
this
is
living
said
green
out
loud
and
he
wondered
that
his
voice
shook
as
much
as
his
legs
did
and
yet
he
felt
a
wild
exultance
shooting
through
his
fear
and
knew
that
he
was
tasting
both
with
a
fine
liking
perhaps
he
thought
he
really
liked
this
moment
even
if
his
death
was
around
the
corner
because
he
been
repressed
so
long
and
violence
was
a
wonderful
therapy
for
releasing
his
resentment
and
fury
whatever
the
reason
he
knew
that
this
was
one
of
the
high
moments
of
his
life
and
that
if
he
survived
he
look
back
on
it
with
pleasure
and
pride
and
that
was
the
strangest
thing
of
all
since
in
his
culture
the
young
were
taught
to
abhor
violence
luckily
they
were
so
conditioned
against
it
that
the
very
thought
of
it
paralyzed
them
no
hard
neural
paths
had
been
set
up
against
the
action
of
violence
it
was
just
that
philosophically
speaking
they
loathed
the
concept
fortunately
there
was
a
philosophy
of
the
body
too
a
much
older
and
deeper
one
and
while
it
was
true
that
man
could
no
more
live
without
philosophy
of
the
mind
than
he
could
without
bread
it
had
no
place
in
green
at
present
the
fiery
breath
that
flooded
his
body
now
and
made
him
so
sensitive
to
what
a
fine
thing
it
was
to
be
alive
while
death
was
knocking
at
the
door
did
not
rise
from
any
mental
abstraction
or
profound
meditation
green
rolled
back
the
carpets
that
led
from
the
room
to
the
balcony
for
he
wanted
a
firm
footing
if
it
became
necessary
to
make
a
running
broad
jump
from
the
balcony
in
an
effort
to
clear
the
walk
below
and
drop
into
the
moat
he
have
to
have
very
good
timing
and
do
everything
just
right
the
first
time
like
a
parachute
jump
otherwise
he
end
up
with
broken
bones
on
the
hard
stones
below
not
that
he
was
going
to
make
that
leap
unless
he
just
had
to
but
he
was
leaving
an
avenue
open
if
his
other
measures
did
work
again
he
ran
to
the
bureau
and
drew
out
a
large
bag
of
gunpowder
weighing
at
least
five
pounds
in
the
open
end
of
this
he
inserted
a
fuse
and
tied
the
neck
around
it
while
he
was
doing
this
he
heard
shouts
and
cheers
as
the
soldiers
returned
to
the
door
picked
up
their
ram
and
hurled
themselves
at
the
thick
planking
he
did
not
bother
shooting
again
but
instead
lit
the
fuse
with
a
candle
then
he
walked
to
the
large
door
pushed
out
the
small
dog
door
and
tossed
the
bag
through
it
he
jumped
back
and
ran
though
there
was
little
chance
that
the
resultant
explosion
would
harm
the
door
there
was
a
silence
as
the
soldiers
were
probably
staring
paralyzed
at
the
smoking
fuse
then
a
roar
the
room
shook
the
door
fell
in
blasted
off
its
hinges
and
black
smoke
poured
in
green
ran
into
the
cloud
got
down
on
all
fours
scuttled
through
the
doorway
cursed
desperately
when
the
hilt
of
his
sword
caught
on
the
doorframe
tore
loose
and
lunged
through
into
the
dense
smoke
that
filled
the
anteroom
his
groping
hands
felt
the
ram
where
it
had
dropped
and
the
wet
warm
face
of
a
soldier
who
fallen
he
coughed
sharply
from
the
biting
fumes
but
went
on
until
his
head
butted
into
the
wall
then
he
felt
to
his
right
where
he
imagined
the
door
was
came
to
it
passed
through
and
on
into
the
next
room
also
filled
with
a
cloud
after
scuttled
like
a
bug
across
its
floor
he
dared
to
open
his
eyes
for
a
quick
look
the
smoke
was
thinner
and
was
pouring
out
the
door
to
the
hallway
just
in
front
of
him
he
saw
no
feet
in
the
clearer
area
between
the
floor
and
the
bottom
of
the
clouds
so
he
rose
and
walked
through
the
door
to
his
left
he
knew
the
hall
led
to
a
stairway
that
was
probably
now
jammed
with
soldiers
to
his
right
would
be
another
stairway
that
went
up
to
the
duke
apartments
that
was
the
only
way
he
could
go
luckily
the
smoke
was
still
so
dense
in
the
corridor
that
those
assembled
on
the
left
staircase
could
see
him
they
think
he
was
in
the
duchess
rooms
yet
and
he
hoped
that
when
they
did
rush
it
and
did
find
him
there
the
carpets
would
give
them
the
idea
that
he
taken
a
running
broad
jump
from
the
balcony
in
which
case
they
at
once
search
the
moat
for
him
and
if
they
did
find
him
swimming
there
as
they
would
then
they
might
presume
he
either
drowned
or
else
got
to
the
shore
and
was
now
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
city
he
felt
along
the
wall
toward
the
staircase
his
other
hand
gripping
the
stiletto
when
his
fingers
ran
across
the
arm
of
a
man
leaning
against
the
wall
he
withdrew
them
at
once
bent
his
knees
and
in
a
crouching
position
ran
in
the
general
direction
of
the
stairs
the
smoke
got
even
thinner
here
so
that
he
saw
the
steps
in
time
to
avoid
falling
over
them
unfortunately
the
duke
and
another
man
were
also
there
both
saw
his
figure
emerge
into
the
torchlight
from
the
clouds
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
who
he
was
so
that
he
had
plunged
the
thin
stiletto
into
the
soldier
throat
before
he
could
act
the
duke
tried
to
leap
past
green
but
the
earthman
stuck
a
leg
out
and
tripped
him
then
he
grabbed
the
ruler
arm
twisted
it
behind
his
back
forced
him
up
and
on
his
knees
and
using
the
arm
as
a
cruel
lever
raised
him
he
enjoyed
hearing
the
duke
moan
though
he
never
consciously
taken
pleasure
in
pain
before
he
had
time
to
think
that
perhaps
he
liked
this
because
of
the
torture
the
duke
had
inflicted
on
his
many
helpless
victims
of
course
he
green
a
highly
civilized
man
should
be
feeling
this
way
but
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
an
emotion
never
kept
anybody
from
experiencing
it
up
you
go
he
said
in
a
low
harsh
voice
directing
the
duke
toward
his
apartments
manipulating
the
twisted
arm
as
a
steering
column
by
then
the
smoke
had
cleared
away
so
that
those
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
could
see
that
something
was
wrong
a
shout
arose
followed
by
the
slap
of
running
feet
on
the
stone
flags
green
stopped
turned
the
duke
so
he
faced
the
approaching
crowd
and
said
to
him
tell
them
that
i
will
kill
you
unless
they
go
away
to
emphasize
his
point
he
stuck
the
end
of
the
stiletto
into
the
back
and
pressed
hard
enough
to
draw
blood
the
duke
quivered
then
became
rigid
nevertheless
he
said
i
will
not
do
so
that
would
be
dishonor
green
could
help
admiring
such
courage
even
if
it
did
make
his
predicament
worse
he
refused
to
kill
the
duke
just
then
because
that
would
throw
away
the
only
trump
card
he
held
at
that
moment
so
he
stuck
the
stiletto
in
his
teeth
and
still
holding
with
one
hand
to
the
duke
twisted
arm
took
the
duke
pistol
from
his
belt
and
fired
over
his
shoulder
there
was
a
whoosh
of
flame
that
burned
the
duke
ear
and
made
him
give
a
cry
that
was
almost
drowned
out
in
the
roar
of
the
explosion
the
nearest
man
threw
up
his
hands
dropping
his
spear
and
fell
on
his
face
the
others
stopped
doubtless
they
were
still
operating
under
the
duchess
orders
not
to
kill
green
for
the
duke
must
have
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
just
in
time
to
witness
the
explosion
of
the
gunpowder
and
he
was
in
no
condition
to
issue
contrary
orders
being
deafened
and
stunned
by
the
report
almost
going
off
in
his
ear
green
shouted
out
go
back
or
i
will
kill
the
duke
it
is
his
wish
that
you
go
back
to
the
stairs
and
do
not
bother
us
until
he
sends
word
to
you
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
torches
he
could
see
the
puzzled
expression
on
the
soldiers
faces
it
was
only
then
he
realized
that
in
his
extreme
excitement
he
had
shouted
the
orders
in
english
hastily
he
translated
his
demands
and
was
relieved
to
see
them
turn
and
retreat
though
reluctantly
he
then
the
duke
up
the
steps
to
his
apartments
where
he
barred
the
door
and
primed
his
pistol
again
so
far
so
good
he
said
in
english
the
question
is
what
now
little
man
the
ruler
rooms
were
even
more
luxurious
than
his
wife
and
were
larger
because
they
had
to
contain
not
only
the
duke
hundreds
of
hunting
trophies
including
human
heads
but
his
collection
of
glass
birds
indeed
one
might
easily
see
where
his
heart
really
lay
for
the
heads
had
collected
dust
whereas
each
and
every
glittering
winged
creature
was
immaculate
it
would
have
gone
hard
on
a
servant
neglected
his
cleaning
duties
in
the
great
rooms
dedicated
to
the
collection
on
seeing
them
green
smiled
slightly
when
you
fighting
for
your
life
hit
a
man
where
he
softest
it
was
a
matter
of
two
minutes
to
tie
the
duke
in
a
chair
with
several
of
the
hunting
whips
hanging
from
the
walls
meanwhile
the
duke
came
out
of
his
daze
he
began
screaming
every
invective
he
knew
and
he
knew
quite
a
lot
and
promising
every
refined
torture
he
could
think
of
and
his
knowledge
was
not
in
that
area
either
green
waited
until
the
duke
had
given
himself
a
bad
case
of
laryngitis
then
he
told
him
in
a
firm
but
quiet
voice
what
he
intended
to
do
unless
the
duke
got
him
out
of
the
castle
to
emphasize
his
determination
he
picked
up
a
bludgeon
studded
with
iron
spikes
and
swung
it
whistling
through
the
air
the
duke
eyes
widened
and
he
paled
all
of
a
sudden
he
changed
from
a
defiant
ruler
challenging
his
captor
to
inflict
his
worst
upon
him
to
a
shrunken
trembling
old
man
and
i
will
smash
every
last
bird
in
these
rooms
said
green
and
i
will
open
the
chest
that
lies
behind
that
pile
of
furs
and
take
out
of
it
your
most
precious
treasure
the
bird
you
have
not
even
shown
to
the
emperor
for
fear
he
would
get
jealous
and
demand
it
as
a
gift
from
you
the
bird
you
take
out
at
rare
intervals
and
over
which
you
gloat
all
night
my
wife
told
you
gasped
the
duke
oh
what
an
she
is
granted
said
green
she
babbled
to
me
many
secrets
being
a
featherbrained
idle
silly
stupid
female
a
fit
consort
for
you
so
i
know
where
the
unique
statuette
made
by
izan
yushwa
of
metzva
moosh
is
hidden
the
glass
bird
that
cost
the
whole
dukedom
a
great
tax
and
brought
many
bitter
tears
and
hardships
from
your
subjects
i
will
have
no
compunction
about
destroying
it
even
if
it
is
the
only
one
ever
made
and
if
izan
yushwa
is
now
dead
so
that
it
can
never
be
replaced
the
duke
eyes
bulged
in
horror
no
no
he
said
in
a
quavering
voice
that
would
be
unthinkable
blasphemous
sacrilegious
have
you
no
sense
of
beauty
degenerate
slave
that
you
are
that
you
would
smash
forever
that
most
beautiful
of
all
things
made
by
the
hands
of
man
i
would
the
duke
mouth
drew
down
at
the
corners
suddenly
he
was
weeping
green
was
embarrassed
for
he
knew
how
great
must
be
the
emotion
that
could
make
this
man
educated
in
a
hard
school
break
down
before
an
enemy
and
he
reflected
upon
what
a
strange
thing
a
human
being
was
here
was
a
man
who
would
literally
allow
his
throat
to
be
cut
before
he
would
display
cowardice
by
bargaining
for
it
but
to
have
his
precious
collection
of
glass
birds
threatened
green
shrugged
why
try
to
understand
it
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
use
whatever
came
his
way
very
well
if
you
wish
to
save
them
you
must
do
this
and
he
detailed
exactly
the
duke
moves
and
orders
for
the
next
ten
minutes
he
thereupon
made
him
swear
by
the
most
holy
oaths
and
upon
his
family
name
and
by
the
honor
of
the
founder
of
his
family
that
he
would
not
betray
green
to
make
sure
added
the
earthman
i
shall
take
the
with
me
once
i
know
your
word
is
good
i
take
steps
to
see
that
it
is
returned
undamaged
to
you
can
i
depend
on
that
breathed
the
duke
hoarsely
rolling
his
big
brown
eyes
yes
i
will
contact
zingaro
business
agent
of
the
thieves
guild
and
he
will
return
it
to
you
for
a
compensation
of
course
but
before
we
conclude
this
bargain
you
must
swear
that
you
will
not
harm
amra
my
wife
nor
any
of
her
children
nor
confiscate
her
business
but
will
behave
toward
her
as
if
this
had
never
happened
the
duke
swallowed
hard
but
he
swore
green
was
happy
because
though
he
was
going
to
desert
amra
he
was
at
least
insuring
her
future
it
was
a
long
long
hour
later
that
green
came
out
of
his
hiding
place
inside
a
large
closet
in
the
duke
apartment
even
though
the
duke
had
sworn
the
holiest
of
oaths
he
was
as
treacherous
as
any
of
the
barbarians
on
this
planet
and
that
was
very
treacherous
indeed
green
had
stood
behind
the
door
sweating
and
listening
to
the
loud
and
sometimes
incoherent
conversation
taking
place
between
the
duke
his
soldiers
and
the
duchess
the
duke
was
a
good
actor
for
he
convinced
everybody
that
he
had
escaped
from
the
mad
slave
green
had
seized
a
sword
and
forced
him
to
make
a
running
broad
jump
from
the
balcony
railing
of
course
several
guardsmen
had
seen
a
large
object
hurtle
from
the
balcony
and
fall
with
a
loud
splash
into
the
moat
below
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
slave
must
have
broken
his
back
when
he
struck
the
water
or
else
he
had
been
knocked
out
and
then
drowned
whatever
had
happened
he
had
not
come
out
green
his
ear
against
the
door
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
despite
his
tension
he
and
the
duke
had
combined
forces
to
heave
out
a
wooden
statue
of
the
god
zuzupatr
weighted
with
iron
dishes
tied
to
it
so
that
it
would
float
in
the
moonlight
and
the
excitement
the
idol
must
have
looked
enough
like
a
falling
man
to
deceive
anybody
the
only
one
seemingly
not
satisfied
was
zuni
she
raised
every
kind
of
hell
she
knew
behaved
in
a
most
undignified
manner
screeched
at
her
husband
because
his
and
lack
of
restraint
had
robbed
her
of
the
exquisite
tortures
she
planned
for
the
slave
who
had
attempted
to
dishonor
her
the
duke
his
face
getting
redder
and
redder
had
suddenly
bellowed
out
at
her
to
quit
acting
like
a
condemned
and
go
at
once
to
her
apartments
to
show
that
he
meant
what
he
said
he
ordered
several
soldiers
to
escort
her
zuni
however
was
too
stupid
to
see
how
perilous
was
her
situation
how
near
the
headsman
ax
she
raved
on
until
the
duke
gave
a
sign
and
two
soldiers
seized
her
elbows
at
least
green
supposed
they
did
for
she
yelled
at
them
to
take
their
dirty
hands
off
her
and
propelled
her
out
of
the
rooms
even
then
it
took
some
time
before
the
duke
could
close
the
doors
on
his
last
guest
the
little
ruler
opened
the
door
in
his
hand
he
held
a
priest
green
robe
the
sacerdotal
hexagonal
spectacles
and
a
mask
for
the
lower
part
of
the
face
the
mask
was
customarily
worn
when
a
monk
was
on
a
mission
for
a
high
dignitary
during
the
time
the
face
was
covered
the
monk
was
under
a
vow
not
to
speak
to
anyone
until
he
had
reached
the
person
for
whom
he
had
a
message
thus
green
would
not
be
bothered
with
any
embarrassing
questions
he
put
on
the
robe
spectacles
and
mask
threw
the
hood
over
his
head
and
placed
the
glass
inside
his
shirt
his
loaded
pistol
he
kept
up
one
capacious
sleeve
holding
it
with
the
other
hand
remember
said
the
duke
anxiously
as
he
opened
the
door
and
peered
out
to
see
if
anybody
was
on
the
staircase
remember
that
you
must
take
every
precaution
against
damaging
the
tell
zingaro
that
he
must
at
once
pack
it
in
a
chest
filled
with
silks
and
sawdust
so
it
wo
break
i
will
die
a
thousand
deaths
until
it
comes
back
once
again
to
my
collection
and
i
thought
green
will
die
a
thousand
deaths
until
i
get
safely
out
of
your
reach
out
of
the
city
and
far
away
on
a
windroller
he
promised
again
that
he
would
keep
his
word
as
well
as
the
duke
kept
his
but
that
he
would
also
take
every
measure
to
insure
against
treachery
then
he
slipped
out
and
closed
the
door
he
was
on
his
own
until
he
boarded
the
of
he
had
no
trouble
at
all
except
for
making
his
way
through
the
thick
traffic
the
explosions
and
shouting
coming
from
the
castle
had
aroused
the
whole
town
so
that
everybody
who
could
stand
on
his
two
feet
or
could
get
somebody
to
carry
him
was
outside
milling
around
asking
questions
talking
excitedly
and
in
general
trying
to
make
as
much
chaos
as
possible
and
to
enjoy
every
bit
of
this
excuse
to
take
part
in
a
general
disturbance
green
strode
through
them
his
head
bent
but
his
eyes
probing
ahead
he
made
fairly
good
progress
only
being
held
up
temporarily
a
few
times
by
the
human
herd
finally
the
flat
plain
of
the
windbreak
lay
before
him
and
the
many
masts
of
the
great
wheeled
vessels
were
a
forest
around
him
he
was
able
to
get
to
the
of
unchallenged
by
any
of
the
dozens
of
guardsmen
that
he
passed
the
herself
lay
snugly
between
two
docks
where
a
huge
gang
of
slaves
had
towed
her
there
was
a
gangway
running
up
from
one
of
the
docks
and
at
both
ends
stood
a
sailor
on
guard
clad
in
the
family
colors
of
yellow
violet
and
crimson
they
chewed
nut
something
like
betel
except
that
it
stained
both
teeth
and
lips
and
gave
them
a
green
color
when
green
stepped
boldly
upon
the
gangway
the
nearest
guard
looked
doubtful
and
put
his
hand
on
his
knife
evidently
he
had
no
orders
from
miran
about
a
priest
but
he
knew
what
the
mask
indicated
and
that
awed
him
enough
so
that
he
did
not
dare
oppose
the
stranger
nor
was
the
second
guard
any
quicker
in
making
up
his
mind
green
slipped
by
him
entered
the
and
walked
up
the
gangway
to
the
foredeck
he
knocked
quietly
on
the
door
of
the
captain
cabin
a
moment
later
it
swung
violently
open
light
flooded
out
then
was
blocked
off
by
miran
huge
round
bulk
green
stepped
inside
pressing
the
captain
back
miran
reached
for
his
dagger
but
stopped
when
he
saw
the
intruder
take
off
the
mask
and
spectacles
and
throw
back
the
hood
green
so
you
made
it
i
did
not
think
it
was
possible
with
me
all
things
are
possible
replied
green
modestly
he
sat
down
at
the
table
or
rather
crumpled
at
it
and
began
repeating
in
a
dry
voice
halting
with
fatigue
the
story
of
his
escape
in
a
few
minutes
the
narrow
cabin
rang
with
the
captain
laughter
and
his
one
eye
twinkled
and
beamed
as
he
slapped
green
on
the
back
and
said
that
by
all
the
gods
here
was
a
man
he
was
proud
to
have
aboard
have
a
drink
of
this
lespaxian
wine
even
better
than
chalousma
and
one
i
bring
out
only
for
honored
guests
said
miran
chortling
green
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
proffered
glass
but
his
fingers
never
closed
upon
the
stem
for
his
head
sank
onto
the
tabletop
and
his
snores
were
tremendous
it
was
three
days
later
that
a
green
his
skin
comfortably
even
glowingly
tight
with
superb
lespaxian
sat
at
the
table
and
waited
for
the
word
to
come
that
he
could
finally
leave
the
cabin
the
first
day
of
inactivity
he
slept
and
eaten
and
paced
back
and
forth
anxious
for
news
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
city
at
nightfall
miran
had
returned
with
the
story
that
a
furious
search
was
organized
in
the
city
itself
and
the
outlying
hills
of
course
the
duke
would
insist
that
the
themselves
be
turned
and
miran
was
cursing
because
that
would
mean
a
fatal
delay
they
could
not
wait
for
more
than
three
more
days
the
fish
tanks
had
been
installed
the
provisions
were
almost
all
in
the
hold
his
roistering
crewmen
were
being
dragged
out
of
the
taverns
and
sobered
up
two
days
after
tomorrow
the
great
vessel
would
have
to
be
towed
out
of
the
windbreak
and
sails
set
for
the
perilous
and
long
voyage
i
would
worry
said
green
you
will
find
that
tomorrow
word
will
come
from
the
hills
that
green
has
been
killed
by
a
wild
man
of
the
clan
axaquexcan
who
will
demand
money
before
handing
the
dead
head
over
the
duke
will
accept
this
as
true
and
will
conveniently
forget
all
about
searching
the
miran
rubbed
his
fat
oily
palms
while
one
pale
eye
glowed
he
loved
a
good
intrigue
the
more
elaborate
the
better
but
the
second
day
even
though
what
green
had
predicted
came
true
miran
became
nervous
and
began
to
find
the
big
blond
man
constant
presence
in
his
cabin
irksome
he
wanted
to
send
him
down
into
the
hold
but
green
firmly
refused
reminding
the
captain
of
his
promise
of
haven
within
these
very
walls
he
then
calmly
appropriated
another
bottle
of
the
merchant
lespaxian
having
located
its
hiding
place
and
drank
it
miran
glowered
and
his
face
twitched
with
repressed
resentment
but
he
said
nothing
because
of
the
custom
that
a
guest
could
do
what
he
pleased
within
reasonable
limits
the
third
day
miran
was
positively
a
tub
of
nerves
jittery
sweating
pacing
back
and
forth
at
last
he
left
the
cabin
only
to
begin
pacing
back
and
forth
on
the
deck
green
could
hear
his
footsteps
for
hours
the
fourth
day
he
was
up
at
dawn
and
bellowing
orders
to
his
crewmen
a
little
later
green
felt
the
big
vessel
move
and
heard
the
shouts
of
the
foremen
of
the
towing
gangs
and
the
chants
of
the
slaves
as
they
bent
their
backs
hauling
at
the
huge
ropes
attached
to
the
slowly
oh
so
slowly
it
seemed
to
green
the
craft
creaked
forward
he
dared
open
a
curtain
to
look
out
the
square
before
him
was
the
rearing
side
of
another
and
just
for
a
second
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
not
his
vessel
was
the
one
that
was
moving
then
he
saw
that
the
was
advancing
at
a
pace
of
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
a
minute
it
would
take
them
an
hour
to
get
past
the
towering
brick
walls
of
the
windbreak
he
sweated
out
that
hour
and
unconsciously
fell
into
his
childhood
habit
of
biting
his
nails
expecting
at
any
time
to
see
the
docks
suddenly
boil
with
soldiers
running
after
the
of
shouting
for
it
to
stop
because
it
had
a
runaway
slave
aboard
but
no
such
thing
occurred
and
at
last
the
tug
gangs
stopped
and
began
coiling
up
their
ropes
and
green
quit
chewing
his
nails
miran
shouted
orders
the
first
mate
repeated
them
there
was
the
slap
of
many
feet
on
the
decks
above
the
sound
of
many
voices
chanting
a
sound
as
of
a
knife
cutting
cloth
told
that
the
sails
had
been
released
suddenly
the
vessel
rocked
as
the
wind
caught
it
and
a
vibration
through
the
floors
announced
that
the
big
axles
were
turning
the
huge
wheels
with
their
tires
of
a
kind
of
rubber
were
revolving
the
was
on
the
wing
green
opened
the
door
slightly
and
took
one
last
look
at
the
city
of
quotz
it
was
receding
rapidly
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
and
at
this
distance
it
looked
like
a
toy
city
nestled
in
the
lap
of
a
hillock
now
that
the
danger
from
it
was
gone
and
the
odors
too
far
away
to
offend
his
nose
it
looked
quite
romantic
and
enticing
and
so
we
say
farewell
to
exotic
quotz
murmured
green
in
the
approved
travelog
fashion
so
long
you
son
of
an
then
though
he
was
supposed
to
stay
inside
until
miran
summoned
him
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
and
almost
fainted
dead
away
hello
honey
said
amra
green
scarcely
heard
the
children
grouped
around
her
also
extend
their
greetings
he
was
just
coming
out
of
the
dizziness
and
blackness
that
had
threatened
to
overcome
him
perhaps
it
was
the
wine
coupled
with
the
shock
perhaps
he
was
to
think
later
it
was
just
that
he
was
plain
scared
scared
as
he
not
been
in
the
castle
ashamed
too
that
amra
had
found
out
his
plans
to
desert
her
and
deeply
ashamed
because
she
loved
him
anyway
and
would
not
allow
him
to
go
without
her
she
had
a
tremendous
pride
that
must
have
cost
her
great
effort
to
choke
down
probably
he
was
to
say
to
himself
later
on
it
was
sheer
fear
of
her
tongue
that
made
him
quail
so
there
was
nothing
that
a
man
dreaded
so
much
as
a
woman
tonguelashing
especially
if
he
deserved
it
oh
especially
that
was
to
come
later
at
the
moment
amra
was
strangely
quiet
and
meek
all
she
would
say
was
that
she
had
many
business
connections
and
that
she
knew
well
zingaro
the
thieves
guild
business
agent
they
had
been
childhood
playmates
and
they
helped
each
other
in
various
shady
transactions
since
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
hear
about
the
a
slave
hiding
on
the
of
had
given
zingaro
to
take
back
to
the
duke
cornering
zingaro
she
had
worked
out
of
him
enough
information
to
be
sure
that
green
had
escaped
to
the
after
all
zingaro
was
under
oath
only
to
be
reticent
about
certain
details
of
the
whole
matter
from
there
she
had
taken
the
business
into
her
own
hands
had
told
miran
that
she
would
inform
the
duchess
of
green
whereabouts
unless
he
permitted
her
and
her
family
to
go
along
on
the
voyage
here
i
am
your
faithful
and
loyal
wife
she
said
opening
her
arms
in
an
expansive
gesture
i
am
overwhelmed
with
emotion
replied
green
for
once
not
exaggerating
then
come
and
embrace
me
she
cried
and
do
stand
there
as
if
you
seen
the
dead
return
from
the
grave
before
all
these
people
he
said
looking
around
at
the
grinning
captain
and
first
mate
on
the
foredeck
beside
him
and
at
the
sailors
and
their
families
on
the
middeck
below
the
only
ones
not
watching
him
were
the
goggled
helmsmen
whose
backs
were
turned
because
they
were
intent
on
wrestling
with
the
great
spoked
wheel
why
not
she
retorted
you
be
sleeping
on
the
open
deck
with
them
eating
with
them
breathing
their
breath
feeling
their
elbows
at
every
turn
cursing
laughing
fighting
getting
drunk
making
love
all
all
on
the
open
deck
so
why
not
embrace
me
or
do
you
want
me
to
be
here
the
thought
never
entered
my
head
he
said
stepping
up
to
her
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
or
if
it
had
he
reflected
you
can
bet
that
i
not
dare
say
it
after
all
it
was
good
to
feel
her
soft
warm
firmly
curved
body
again
and
know
that
there
was
at
least
one
person
on
this
godforsaken
planet
that
cared
for
him
what
could
have
made
him
think
for
one
minute
that
he
could
endure
life
without
her
well
he
had
she
just
would
not
could
not
fit
into
his
life
if
he
ever
got
back
on
earth
miran
coughed
and
said
you
two
and
your
children
and
maid
must
get
off
the
deck
and
go
amidships
that
is
where
you
will
live
never
again
must
you
set
foot
upon
the
steering
deck
unless
you
are
summoned
i
run
a
tight
ship
and
discipline
is
strictly
adhered
to
green
followed
amra
and
the
children
down
the
steps
to
the
deck
below
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
inzax
the
pretty
blond
slave
who
took
care
of
the
children
was
also
aboard
you
had
to
give
credit
to
amra
wherever
she
went
she
traveled
in
style
he
also
thought
that
if
this
was
a
tight
ship
a
loose
one
must
be
sheer
chaos
cats
and
dogs
were
running
here
and
there
playing
with
the
many
infants
or
else
fighting
with
each
other
women
sat
and
sewed
or
hung
up
washing
or
dried
dishes
or
nursed
babies
hens
clucked
defiantly
from
behind
the
bars
of
their
coops
scattered
everywhere
on
the
port
side
there
was
even
a
pigpen
holding
about
thirty
of
the
tiny
porcines
green
followed
amra
to
a
place
where
an
awning
had
been
stretched
to
make
a
roof
is
this
nice
she
said
it
has
sides
which
we
can
pull
down
when
it
rains
or
when
we
want
privacy
as
i
suppose
we
will
you
being
so
funny
in
some
ways
oh
it
delightful
he
hastened
to
assure
her
i
see
you
even
have
some
feather
mattresses
and
a
cookstove
he
looked
around
but
where
are
the
fish
tanks
i
thought
miran
was
going
to
bolt
them
to
the
deck
oh
no
he
said
that
they
were
too
valuable
to
expose
to
gunfire
if
we
encountered
pirates
so
he
had
the
deck
cut
open
wide
enough
to
lower
the
tanks
inside
the
hold
then
the
deck
planking
was
replaced
most
of
these
people
here
would
be
sleeping
below
if
it
were
for
the
tanks
but
there
no
room
now
green
decided
to
take
a
look
around
he
liked
to
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
his
immediate
environment
so
that
he
would
know
how
to
behave
if
an
emergency
arose
the
windroller
itself
was
about
two
hundred
feet
long
its
beam
was
about
feet
the
hull
was
and
the
narrow
keel
rested
on
fourteen
axles
enormous
solid
wheels
turned
at
the
ends
of
these
axles
thick
ropes
of
the
tough
substance
were
tied
to
the
ends
of
the
axles
and
to
the
tops
of
the
hull
itself
these
were
to
hold
the
body
steady
and
keep
it
from
going
over
when
the
reeled
under
too
strong
a
side
wind
and
also
to
provide
some
resiliency
when
the
was
making
a
turn
being
aboard
at
such
times
was
almost
like
being
on
a
ship
as
the
front
pair
of
wheels
the
steering
wheels
turned
and
the
longitudinal
axis
of
the
craft
slowly
changed
direction
the
body
of
the
vessel
thrust
by
the
shifting
impact
of
the
winds
also
tilted
not
too
far
never
as
far
as
a
boat
in
similar
case
but
enough
to
give
one
an
uneasy
feeling
the
cables
on
the
opposing
side
would
stretch
to
a
degree
and
then
would
stop
the
sidewise
motion
of
the
keel
and
there
would
be
a
slight
and
slow
roll
to
the
other
direction
then
a
shorter
and
slower
motion
back
again
it
was
enough
to
make
a
novice
green
sickness
was
uncommon
at
the
beginning
of
a
voyage
or
during
a
violent
windstorm
like
its
aqueous
counterpart
it
affected
the
sufferer
so
that
he
could
only
hang
over
the
rail
and
wish
he
die
the
of
sported
a
curving
bow
and
a
high
foredeck
on
this
was
fastened
the
steering
wheel
two
helmsmen
always
attended
it
two
men
wearing
hexagonal
goggles
and
leather
helmets
with
high
crests
of
curled
wire
behind
them
stood
the
captain
and
first
mate
giving
their
attention
alternately
to
the
helmsmen
and
to
the
sailors
on
deck
and
aloft
the
middeck
was
sunken
and
the
poopdeck
though
raised
was
not
as
high
as
the
foredeck
the
four
masts
were
tall
but
not
as
tall
as
those
of
a
marine
craft
of
similar
size
high
masts
would
have
given
the
a
tendency
to
capsize
in
a
very
strong
wind
despite
the
weight
of
the
axles
and
wheels
therefore
the
yardarms
reaching
far
out
beyond
the
sides
of
the
hull
were
comparatively
longer
than
a
seaship
when
the
carried
a
full
weight
of
canvas
she
looked
to
a
mariner
eyes
squat
and
ungainly
moreover
yards
had
been
fixed
at
right
angles
to
the
top
of
the
hull
and
to
the
keel
itself
extra
canvas
was
hung
between
these
spars
the
sight
of
all
that
sail
sticking
from
between
the
wheels
was
enough
to
drive
an
old
sailor
to
drink
three
masts
were
the
aft
mast
was
rigged
and
was
used
to
help
the
steering
there
was
no
bowsprit
altogether
it
was
a
craft
but
once
one
was
accustomed
to
it
one
saw
it
was
as
beautiful
as
a
ship
of
the
sea
it
was
as
formidable
too
for
the
carried
five
large
cannon
on
the
middeck
six
cannon
on
the
second
deck
a
lighter
swivel
cannon
on
the
steering
deck
and
two
swivels
on
the
poopdeck
hung
from
davits
were
two
long
liferollers
and
a
gig
all
wheeled
and
with
folding
masts
if
the
was
wrecked
it
could
be
abandoned
and
all
the
crew
could
scoot
off
in
the
little
rollers
green
was
given
much
time
for
inspection
he
became
aware
that
a
tall
lean
sailor
was
regarding
him
intently
this
fellow
was
but
had
the
pale
blue
eyes
of
the
tropat
hillsmen
he
moved
like
a
cat
and
wore
a
long
thin
dagger
sharp
as
a
claw
a
nasty
customer
thought
green
presently
the
nasty
customer
seeing
that
green
was
not
going
to
notice
him
walked
in
front
of
him
so
that
he
could
not
help
being
annoyed
at
the
same
time
the
babble
around
them
died
and
everybody
turned
his
head
to
stare
friend
said
green
affably
enough
would
you
mind
standing
off
to
one
side
you
are
blocking
my
view
the
fellow
spat
juice
at
green
feet
no
slave
calls
me
friend
yes
i
am
blocking
your
view
and
i
would
mind
getting
out
of
the
way
evidently
you
object
to
my
presence
here
said
green
what
is
the
matter
you
do
like
my
face
no
i
do
and
i
do
like
to
have
as
a
crewmate
a
stinking
slave
speaking
of
odors
said
green
would
you
please
stand
to
leeward
of
me
i
been
through
a
lot
lately
and
i
a
delicate
stomach
silence
you
son
of
an
roared
the
sailor
have
respect
toward
your
betters
or
i
strike
you
down
and
throw
your
body
overboard
it
takes
two
to
make
a
murder
just
as
it
takes
two
to
make
a
bargain
said
green
in
a
loud
voice
hoping
that
miran
would
hear
and
be
reminded
of
his
promise
of
protection
but
miran
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
had
done
as
much
as
he
could
it
was
up
to
green
to
make
his
way
from
now
on
it
is
true
that
i
am
a
slave
he
said
but
i
was
not
born
one
before
being
captured
i
was
a
freeman
who
knew
liberty
as
none
of
you
here
know
it
i
came
from
a
country
where
there
were
no
masters
because
every
man
was
his
own
master
however
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
point
is
that
i
earned
my
freedom
that
i
fought
like
a
warrior
not
a
slave
to
get
aboard
the
i
wish
to
become
a
crew
member
to
become
a
to
the
clan
effenycan
ah
indeed
and
what
can
you
contribute
to
the
clan
that
we
should
consider
you
worthy
of
sharing
our
blood
what
indeed
green
thought
the
sweat
broke
out
all
over
his
body
though
the
morning
wind
was
cool
at
that
moment
he
saw
miran
speak
to
a
sailor
who
disappeared
below
decks
and
come
out
almost
at
once
carrying
a
small
harp
in
his
hand
oh
yes
now
he
remembered
that
he
had
told
the
captain
what
a
wonderful
harpist
and
singer
he
was
just
the
man
that
the
clan
eager
for
entertainment
on
the
long
voyages
would
be
likely
to
initiate
the
unfortunate
thing
about
that
was
that
green
could
play
a
note
nevertheless
he
took
the
instrument
from
the
sailor
and
gravely
plucked
its
strings
he
listened
to
the
tones
frowned
adjusted
the
pegs
plucked
them
again
then
handed
the
harp
back
sorry
this
is
an
inferior
instrument
he
said
haughtily
you
anything
better
i
could
think
of
degrading
my
art
on
such
a
cheap
monstrosity
gods
above
screamed
a
man
standing
nearby
that
is
my
harp
you
are
talking
about
the
beloved
harp
of
me
the
bard
grazoot
slave
son
of
a
laryngiteal
mother
you
will
answer
to
me
for
that
insult
no
said
the
sailor
this
is
my
affair
i
ezkr
will
test
this
lubber
fitness
to
join
the
clan
and
be
called
brother
over
my
dead
body
brother
if
you
so
wish
it
brother
there
were
more
angry
words
until
presently
miran
himself
came
down
to
the
middeck
by
mennirox
this
is
a
disgrace
he
bellowed
two
effenycan
quarreling
before
a
slave
come
make
a
decision
quietly
or
i
will
have
you
both
thrown
overboard
it
is
not
too
far
to
walk
back
to
quotz
we
will
cast
dice
to
see
who
is
the
lucky
man
said
the
sailor
ezkr
grinning
he
reached
into
the
pouch
that
hung
from
his
belt
and
pulled
out
the
hexagonal
ivories
a
few
minutes
later
he
rose
from
his
knees
having
won
four
out
of
six
throws
green
was
disappointed
more
than
he
cared
to
show
for
he
had
hoped
that
if
he
had
to
fight
anybody
it
would
be
the
pudgy
harpist
not
the
tough
sailor
ezkr
seemed
to
agree
with
green
that
he
could
not
have
had
worse
luck
chewing
so
rapidly
that
the
slaver
ran
down
his
long
chin
ezkr
announced
the
terms
that
the
blond
slave
would
have
to
meet
to
prove
his
fitness
for
a
moment
green
thought
of
leaving
the
ship
and
making
his
way
on
foot
miran
protested
loudly
this
is
ridiculous
why
can
you
not
fight
on
deck
like
two
ordinary
men
and
be
satisfied
if
one
gives
the
other
a
flesh
wound
that
way
i
wo
stand
the
chance
of
losing
you
ezkr
one
of
my
top
topmen
if
you
should
slip
who
could
take
your
place
this
green
hand
here
ezkr
ignored
his
captain
indignation
knowing
that
the
code
of
the
clan
protected
him
he
spit
and
said
anybody
can
wield
a
dagger
i
want
to
see
what
kind
of
a
man
this
green
is
aloft
walking
a
yard
is
the
best
way
to
see
the
color
of
his
blood
yes
thought
green
his
skin
you
likely
see
my
blood
all
right
splashed
from
here
to
the
horizon
when
i
fall
he
asked
miran
if
he
could
withdraw
a
moment
to
his
tent
to
pray
to
his
gods
for
success
miran
nodded
and
green
had
amra
let
down
the
sides
of
his
shelter
while
he
dropped
to
his
knees
as
soon
as
his
privacy
was
assured
he
handed
her
a
long
turban
cloth
and
told
her
to
go
outside
she
looked
surprised
but
when
he
told
her
what
else
she
was
to
do
she
smiled
and
kissed
him
you
are
a
clever
man
alan
i
was
right
to
prefer
you
above
any
other
man
i
might
have
had
and
i
could
have
had
the
best
save
the
compliments
for
afterwards
when
we
know
if
it
works
he
said
hurry
to
the
stove
and
do
what
i
say
if
anybody
asks
you
what
you
are
up
to
tell
them
that
the
stuff
is
necessary
for
my
religious
ritual
the
gods
he
said
as
she
ducked
through
the
tent
opening
often
come
in
handy
if
they
did
exist
it
would
be
necessary
to
invent
them
amra
paused
and
turned
with
an
adoring
face
ah
alan
that
is
one
of
the
many
things
for
which
i
love
you
you
are
always
originating
these
witty
sayings
how
clever
and
how
dangerously
blasphemous
he
shrugged
airily
dismissing
her
compliment
as
if
it
were
nothing
in
a
minute
she
returned
with
the
turban
wrapped
around
something
limp
but
heavy
and
within
two
minutes
he
stepped
out
from
the
tent
clad
in
a
loincloth
leather
belt
dagger
and
turban
silently
he
began
climbing
the
rope
ladder
that
rose
to
the
tip
of
the
nearest
mast
behind
him
came
ezkr
he
did
get
some
encouragement
from
amra
and
the
children
the
two
boys
cried
out
to
him
to
cut
the
throat
but
if
he
was
killed
instead
they
would
avenge
him
when
they
grew
up
if
not
sooner
even
the
blond
maid
inzax
wept
he
felt
somewhat
better
for
it
was
good
to
know
that
some
people
cared
for
him
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
to
survive
and
make
sure
that
these
women
and
children
did
come
to
grief
was
an
added
stimulus
nevertheless
he
felt
his
momentarily
gained
courage
oozing
out
of
his
sweat
pores
with
every
step
upward
it
was
so
high
up
here
and
so
far
down
below
the
craft
itself
became
smaller
and
smaller
and
the
people
shrank
to
dolls
to
upturned
white
faces
that
soon
became
less
faces
than
blanks
the
wind
howled
through
the
rigging
and
the
mast
which
had
seemed
so
solid
and
steady
when
he
was
at
its
base
now
became
fragile
and
swaying
it
takes
guts
to
be
a
sailor
and
a
of
the
clan
effenycan
said
ezkr
do
you
have
them
green
yes
but
if
i
get
any
sicker
i
lose
them
and
you
be
sorry
being
below
me
muttered
green
to
himself
finally
after
what
seemed
endless
clambering
into
the
very
clouds
themselves
he
arrived
at
the
topmost
yard
if
he
had
thought
the
mast
thin
and
flexible
the
arm
seemed
like
a
toothpick
poised
over
an
abyss
and
he
was
supposed
to
inch
his
way
out
to
the
whipping
tip
then
turn
and
come
back
fighting
if
you
were
not
a
coward
you
would
stand
up
and
walk
out
called
ezkr
sticks
and
stones
will
break
my
bones
replied
green
but
did
not
enlighten
the
puzzled
sailor
as
to
what
he
meant
sitting
down
on
the
yard
he
put
his
legs
around
it
and
began
working
his
way
out
halfway
to
the
arm
he
stopped
and
dared
to
look
down
once
was
enough
there
was
nothing
but
hard
grassy
ground
directly
beneath
him
seemingly
a
mile
below
and
the
flat
plain
rushing
by
and
the
huge
wheels
turning
turning
go
on
shouted
ezkr
green
turned
his
head
and
told
him
in
indelicate
language
what
he
could
do
with
the
yard
and
the
whole
ship
for
that
matter
if
he
could
manage
it
ezkr
dark
face
reddened
and
he
stood
up
and
began
walking
out
on
the
yard
green
eyes
widened
this
man
could
actually
do
it
but
when
he
was
a
few
feet
away
the
sailor
stopped
and
said
no
you
are
trying
to
anger
me
so
i
will
grapple
with
you
here
and
perhaps
be
pushed
off
since
you
have
a
firmer
hold
no
i
will
not
be
such
a
fool
it
is
you
who
must
try
to
get
past
me
he
turned
and
walked
almost
carelessly
back
to
the
mast
against
which
he
leaned
while
he
waited
you
have
to
go
out
to
the
very
end
he
repeated
else
you
pass
the
test
even
if
you
should
get
by
me
which
of
course
you
wo
green
gritted
his
teeth
and
humped
out
to
what
he
considered
close
enough
to
the
end
about
two
feet
away
any
more
might
break
the
arm
as
it
was
already
bending
far
down
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
he
then
backed
away
managed
to
turn
and
to
work
back
to
within
several
feet
of
ezkr
here
he
paused
to
regain
his
breath
his
strength
and
his
courage
the
sailor
waited
one
hand
on
a
rope
to
steady
himself
the
other
with
its
dagger
held
at
green
the
earthman
began
unwinding
his
turban
what
are
you
doing
said
ezkr
frowning
with
sudden
anxiety
up
to
this
point
he
had
been
master
because
he
knew
what
to
expect
but
if
something
unconventional
happened
green
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
continued
his
very
careful
and
slow
unwrapping
of
his
headpiece
i
do
want
to
spill
this
he
said
spill
what
this
shouted
green
and
he
whipped
the
turban
upward
towards
face
the
turban
itself
was
too
far
from
the
sailor
to
touch
him
but
the
sand
contained
within
it
flew
into
his
eyes
before
the
wind
could
dissipate
it
amra
following
her
husband
directions
had
collected
a
large
amount
from
the
fireplace
sand
pile
to
wrap
in
it
and
though
it
had
made
his
head
feel
heavy
it
had
been
worth
it
ezkr
screamed
and
clutched
at
his
eyes
releasing
his
dagger
at
the
same
time
green
slid
forward
and
rammed
his
fist
into
the
man
groin
then
as
ezkr
crumpled
toward
him
he
caught
him
and
eased
him
down
he
followed
his
first
blow
with
a
chopping
of
the
edge
of
his
palm
against
the
fellow
neck
ezkr
quit
screaming
and
passed
out
green
rolled
him
over
so
that
he
lay
on
his
stomach
across
the
yard
supported
on
one
side
by
the
mast
with
his
legs
arms
and
head
dangling
that
was
all
he
wanted
to
do
for
him
he
had
no
intention
of
carrying
him
down
his
only
wish
was
to
get
to
the
deck
where
he
be
safe
if
ezkr
fell
off
now
too
bad
amra
and
inzax
were
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
shrouds
when
green
slowly
climbed
off
when
he
set
foot
on
the
deck
he
thought
his
legs
would
give
way
they
were
trembling
so
amra
noticing
this
quickly
put
her
arms
around
him
as
if
to
embrace
the
conquering
hero
but
actually
to
help
support
him
thanks
he
muttered
i
need
your
strength
amra
anybody
would
who
had
done
what
you
done
she
said
but
my
strength
and
all
of
me
is
at
your
disposal
alan
the
children
were
looking
at
him
with
wide
admiring
eyes
and
yelling
that
our
daddy
big
blond
green
he
quick
as
a
grass
cat
bites
like
a
dire
dog
and
spit
poison
in
your
eye
like
a
flying
snake
then
in
the
next
moment
he
was
submerged
under
the
men
and
women
of
the
clan
all
anxious
to
congratulate
him
for
his
feat
and
to
call
him
brother
the
only
ones
who
did
not
crowd
around
trying
to
kiss
him
on
the
lips
were
the
officers
of
the
and
the
wife
and
children
of
the
unfortunate
sailor
ezkr
these
were
climbing
up
the
rigging
to
fasten
a
rope
around
his
waist
and
lower
him
there
one
other
who
remained
aloof
that
was
the
harpist
grazoot
he
was
still
sulking
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
green
decided
that
he
better
keep
an
eye
on
him
especially
at
night
when
a
knife
could
be
slipped
between
a
sleeper
ribs
and
the
body
thrown
overboard
he
wished
now
that
he
not
gone
out
of
his
way
to
insult
the
fellow
instrument
but
at
the
time
that
had
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
now
he
had
better
try
to
find
some
way
to
pacify
him
two
weeks
of
very
hard
work
and
little
sleep
passed
as
green
learned
the
duties
of
a
topsailman
he
hated
to
go
aloft
but
he
found
that
being
up
so
high
had
its
advantages
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
catch
a
few
winks
now
and
then
there
were
many
crow
nests
where
musketmen
were
stationed
during
a
fight
green
would
slip
down
into
one
of
these
and
go
to
sleep
at
once
his
foster
son
grizquetr
would
stand
watch
for
him
waking
him
if
the
foretop
captain
was
coming
through
the
rigging
toward
them
one
afternoon
griz
whistle
startled
green
out
of
a
sound
sleep
however
the
captain
stopped
to
give
another
sailor
a
lecture
unable
to
go
back
to
sleep
green
watched
a
herd
of
take
to
their
hoofs
at
the
approach
of
the
these
diminutive
equines
beautiful
with
their
orange
bodies
and
black
or
white
manes
and
fetlocks
sometimes
formed
immense
herds
that
must
have
numbered
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands
so
thick
were
they
that
they
looked
like
a
bobbing
sea
of
flashing
heads
and
gleaming
hoofs
stretching
clear
to
the
horizon
to
stretch
to
the
horizon
was
something
on
this
planet
the
plain
was
the
flattest
green
had
ever
seen
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
ran
unbroken
for
thousands
of
miles
but
it
did
and
from
his
high
point
of
view
he
could
see
in
a
vast
circle
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
the
grass
itself
was
tall
and
about
two
feet
high
and
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
through
it
was
a
bright
green
brighter
than
earthly
grass
almost
shiny
during
the
rainy
season
he
was
told
it
would
blossom
with
many
tiny
white
and
red
flowers
and
give
a
pleasing
perfume
now
as
green
watched
something
happened
that
startled
him
abruptly
as
if
a
monster
mowing
machine
had
come
along
the
day
before
the
high
grass
ended
and
a
lawn
began
the
new
grass
seemed
to
be
only
an
inch
high
and
the
lawn
stretched
at
least
a
mile
wide
and
as
far
ahead
of
the
as
he
could
see
what
do
you
think
of
that
he
asked
amra
son
grizquetr
shrugged
i
do
know
the
sailors
say
that
it
is
done
by
the
an
animal
the
size
of
a
ship
that
only
comes
out
at
night
it
eats
grass
but
it
has
the
nasty
temper
of
a
dire
dog
and
will
attack
and
smash
a
as
if
it
were
made
of
cardboard
do
you
believe
that
green
said
watching
him
closely
grizquetr
was
an
intelligent
lad
in
whom
he
hoped
to
plant
a
few
seeds
of
skepticism
perhaps
some
day
those
seeds
might
flower
into
the
beginnings
of
science
i
do
not
know
if
the
story
is
true
or
not
it
is
possible
but
met
nobody
who
has
ever
seen
a
and
if
it
comes
out
only
at
night
where
does
it
hide
during
the
daytime
there
is
no
hole
in
the
ground
large
enough
to
conceal
it
very
good
said
green
smiling
happily
grizquetr
smiled
back
he
worshiped
his
and
nursed
every
bit
of
affection
or
compliment
he
got
from
him
keep
that
open
mind
said
green
neither
believe
nor
disbelieve
until
you
have
solid
evidence
one
way
or
another
and
keep
on
remembering
that
new
evidence
may
come
up
that
will
disprove
the
old
and
firmly
established
he
smiled
wryly
i
could
use
some
of
my
own
advice
i
for
instance
had
at
one
time
absolutely
refused
to
put
any
credence
in
what
i
have
just
seen
with
my
own
eyes
i
put
the
story
down
as
merely
another
idle
story
of
those
who
sail
the
grassy
seas
but
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
perhaps
there
could
be
an
animal
of
some
kind
like
the
both
were
silent
for
a
while
as
they
watched
the
animals
race
off
like
living
orange
rivers
overhead
the
birds
wheeled
in
their
hundreds
of
thousands
of
numbers
they
too
were
beautiful
and
even
more
colorful
than
the
occasionally
one
lit
in
the
rigging
in
a
burst
of
dazzling
feathers
and
a
fury
of
melodious
song
or
raucous
screeches
look
said
the
boy
eagerly
pointing
a
grass
cat
he
been
hiding
waiting
to
catch
a
and
now
he
afraid
he
be
trampled
to
death
by
them
green
gaze
followed
the
other
finger
he
saw
the
body
loping
desperately
ahead
of
the
thundering
hoofs
it
was
completely
closed
in
a
pocket
of
the
beasts
even
as
green
saw
him
the
sides
of
the
pocket
collapsed
and
the
big
cat
disappeared
from
sight
if
he
remained
alive
he
would
do
so
through
a
miracle
suddenly
grizquetr
cried
gods
what
the
matter
cried
green
on
the
horizon
a
sail
it
shaped
like
a
ving
sail
others
saw
it
too
the
ship
rang
with
shouts
a
trumpeter
blew
battle
stations
miran
voice
rose
above
those
of
others
as
he
bellowed
through
a
megaphone
chaos
dissolved
into
order
and
purpose
as
everybody
went
to
his
appointed
place
the
animals
children
and
pregnant
women
were
marshaled
into
the
hold
the
gun
crews
began
unloading
barrels
of
powder
with
a
crane
from
a
hatch
musketmen
swarmed
up
the
rigging
the
entire
topmast
crew
tumbled
aloft
and
took
their
places
as
green
was
already
in
his
he
had
some
leisure
to
observe
the
whole
outlay
of
preparations
for
fight
he
watched
amra
hurriedly
give
her
children
a
kiss
make
sure
they
all
gone
below
then
begin
tearing
strips
of
cloth
for
bandages
and
of
wadding
for
the
muskets
once
she
looked
up
and
waved
at
him
before
turning
back
to
her
task
he
waved
back
and
got
a
severe
reprimand
from
the
for
breaking
discipline
an
extra
watch
for
you
green
after
this
is
over
the
earthman
groaned
and
wished
that
the
martinet
would
fall
off
and
break
every
bone
in
his
body
if
he
lost
any
more
sleep
the
day
wore
on
as
the
strange
ship
came
closer
another
sail
appeared
behind
it
and
the
crew
grew
even
tenser
from
all
appearances
they
were
being
pursued
by
vings
vings
usually
went
in
pairs
then
there
was
the
shape
of
the
sails
which
were
narrower
at
bottom
than
at
top
and
there
was
the
long
low
streamlined
hull
and
the
wheels
nevertheless
discipline
was
somewhat
relaxed
for
a
time
the
pets
and
children
were
allowed
to
come
up
and
meals
were
prepared
by
the
women
even
when
the
swifter
craft
came
close
enough
so
that
the
color
of
the
sails
was
seen
to
be
scarlet
thereby
confirming
their
suspicions
of
the
strangers
identity
battle
stations
were
recalled
miran
estimated
that
by
the
time
the
vings
were
within
cannon
range
night
would
fall
that
is
what
they
hate
and
what
we
love
he
said
pacing
back
and
forth
fingering
his
nose
ring
and
blinking
nervously
his
one
good
eye
it
be
an
hour
before
the
big
moon
comes
up
not
only
that
it
looks
as
though
clouds
may
arise
see
he
cried
to
the
first
mate
by
mennirox
is
that
not
a
wisp
i
detect
in
the
northeast
quarter
by
all
the
gods
i
believe
it
is
said
the
mate
peering
upward
seeing
nothing
but
clear
sky
but
hoping
that
wishing
would
make
the
clouds
come
true
ah
mennirox
is
good
to
his
favorite
worshiper
said
miran
that
loves
thee
shall
book
of
the
true
gods
chapter
ten
verse
eight
and
mennirox
knows
i
love
him
with
compound
interest
yes
that
he
does
said
the
mate
but
what
is
your
plan
as
soon
as
the
last
glow
of
the
sun
disappears
completely
from
the
horizon
so
our
silhouette
wo
be
revealed
we
swing
and
cut
across
their
direct
path
of
advance
we
know
that
they
be
traveling
fairly
close
together
hoping
to
catch
up
with
us
and
blast
us
with
well
we
give
them
a
chance
but
we
be
gone
before
they
can
seize
it
we
go
right
between
them
in
the
dark
and
fire
on
both
by
the
time
they
ready
to
reply
we
have
slipped
on
by
and
then
he
whooped
slapping
his
fat
thigh
they
probably
cannonade
each
other
to
flinders
each
thinking
the
other
is
us
hoo
hoo
hoo
mennirox
had
better
be
with
us
said
the
mate
paling
it
take
damn
tight
calculating
and
more
than
a
bit
of
luck
we
be
going
by
dead
reckoning
not
until
we
almost
on
them
will
we
see
them
and
if
we
headed
straight
at
them
it
be
too
late
to
avoid
a
collision
wharoom
smash
boom
we
done
for
that
very
true
but
we
done
for
if
we
do
pull
some
trick
like
that
they
have
caught
us
by
dawn
they
can
outmaneuver
us
and
they
more
combined
gunfire
and
though
we
fight
like
grass
cats
we
go
down
and
you
know
what
happen
then
the
vings
do
take
prisoners
unless
they
at
the
end
of
a
cruise
and
going
into
port
we
should
have
accepted
the
duke
offer
of
a
convoy
of
frigates
muttered
the
mate
even
one
would
have
been
enough
to
make
the
odds
favor
us
what
and
lose
half
the
profits
of
this
voyage
because
we
have
to
pay
that
robber
duke
for
the
use
of
his
warships
have
you
lost
your
mind
mate
if
i
have
i
not
the
only
one
said
the
mate
turning
into
the
wind
so
his
words
were
lost
but
the
helmsmen
heard
him
and
reported
the
conversation
later
in
five
minutes
it
was
all
over
the
ship
sure
he
greedyguts
himself
the
crew
said
but
then
we
his
relatives
we
know
the
value
of
a
penny
and
is
the
fat
old
darling
the
daring
one
though
who
but
a
captain
of
the
clan
effenycan
would
think
of
such
a
trick
and
carry
it
through
too
and
if
he
such
a
why
then
would
he
be
afraid
to
risk
his
vessel
and
cargo
not
to
mention
his
own
precious
blood
not
to
mention
the
even
more
precious
blood
of
his
relatives
no
miran
may
be
and
and
short
of
temper
and
wind
but
he
the
man
to
hold
down
the
foredeck
brother
dip
me
another
glass
from
that
barrel
and
toast
again
the
cool
courage
and
hot
avariciousness
of
captain
miran
master
merchant
grazoot
the
plump
little
harpist
with
the
effeminate
manners
took
his
harp
and
began
singing
the
song
the
clan
loved
most
the
story
of
how
they
a
hill
tribe
had
come
down
to
the
plains
a
generation
ago
and
how
there
they
had
crept
into
the
windbreak
of
the
city
of
chutlzaj
and
stolen
a
great
windroller
and
how
they
had
ever
since
been
men
of
the
grassy
seas
of
the
vast
flat
xurdimur
and
had
sailed
their
stolen
craft
until
it
was
destroyed
in
a
great
battle
with
a
whole
krinkansprunger
fleet
and
how
they
had
boarded
a
ship
of
the
fleet
and
slain
all
the
men
and
taken
the
women
prisoners
and
sailed
off
with
the
ship
right
through
the
astounded
fleet
and
how
they
had
taken
the
women
as
slaves
and
bred
children
and
how
the
effenycan
blood
was
now
half
krinkansprunger
and
that
was
where
they
got
their
blue
eyes
and
how
the
clan
now
owned
three
big
merchant
ships
or
had
until
two
years
ago
when
the
other
two
rolled
over
the
green
horizon
during
the
month
of
the
oak
and
were
never
heard
of
again
but
they
come
back
some
day
with
strange
tales
and
a
hold
brimming
with
jewels
and
how
the
clan
now
sailed
under
that
mighty
grasping
shrewd
lucky
religious
man
miran
whatever
else
you
could
say
about
grazoot
you
could
not
deny
that
he
had
a
fine
baritone
green
listening
to
his
voice
rise
from
the
deck
far
below
could
vision
the
rise
and
fall
and
rise
again
of
these
people
and
could
appreciate
why
they
were
so
arrogant
and
and
suspicious
and
brave
indeed
if
he
had
been
born
on
this
planet
he
could
have
wanted
no
finer
more
romantic
gypsyish
life
than
that
of
a
sailor
on
a
windroller
provided
that
is
that
he
could
get
plenty
of
sleep
the
boom
of
a
cannon
disturbed
his
reverie
he
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
ball
appear
at
the
end
of
its
arc
and
flash
by
him
it
was
not
enough
to
scare
him
but
watching
it
plow
into
the
ground
about
twenty
feet
away
from
the
starboard
steering
wheel
made
him
realize
what
damage
one
lucky
shot
could
do
however
the
ving
did
not
try
again
he
was
a
canny
pirate
who
knew
better
than
to
throw
away
ammunition
doubtless
he
was
hoping
to
panic
the
merchantman
into
a
frenzy
of
replies
and
useless
useless
because
the
sun
set
just
then
and
in
a
few
minutes
dusk
was
gone
and
darkness
was
all
around
them
miran
did
even
bother
to
tell
his
men
to
hold
their
fire
since
they
would
have
dreamed
of
touching
off
the
cannon
until
he
gave
the
word
instead
he
repeated
that
no
light
should
be
shown
and
that
the
children
must
go
below
decks
and
must
be
kept
quiet
no
one
was
to
make
a
noise
then
casting
one
last
glance
at
the
positions
of
the
pursuing
craft
now
rapidly
dissolving
into
the
night
he
estimated
the
direction
and
strength
of
the
wind
it
was
as
it
had
been
the
day
they
set
sail
an
east
wind
dead
astern
a
good
wind
pushing
them
along
at
eighteen
miles
an
hour
miran
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
to
the
first
mate
and
the
other
officers
and
they
disappeared
into
the
darkness
shrouding
the
decks
they
were
giving
prearranged
orders
not
by
the
customary
bellowing
through
a
megaphone
but
by
low
voices
and
touches
while
they
directed
the
crew
miran
stood
with
bare
feet
upon
the
foredeck
he
held
a
posture
and
acted
as
if
he
were
detecting
the
moves
of
the
invisible
sailors
by
the
vibrations
of
their
activities
running
through
the
wood
of
the
decks
and
the
spars
and
the
masts
and
up
to
his
feet
miran
was
a
fat
nerve
center
that
gathered
in
all
the
unspoken
messages
scattered
everywhere
through
the
body
of
the
he
seemed
to
know
exactly
what
he
was
doing
and
if
he
hesitated
or
doubted
because
of
the
solid
blackness
around
him
he
gave
the
helmsmen
no
sign
his
voice
was
firm
hold
it
steady
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
now
swing
her
hard
aport
hold
her
hold
her
to
green
high
up
on
the
topmost
spar
of
the
foremast
the
turning
about
seemed
an
awful
and
unnatural
deed
he
could
the
hull
and
with
it
his
mast
of
course
leaning
over
and
over
until
his
senses
told
him
that
they
must
inevitably
capsize
and
send
him
crashing
to
the
ground
but
his
senses
lied
for
though
he
seemed
to
fall
forever
the
time
came
when
the
journey
back
toward
an
upright
position
began
then
he
was
sure
he
would
keep
falling
the
other
way
forever
suddenly
the
sails
fluttered
the
vessel
had
come
into
the
dead
spot
where
there
was
no
wind
acting
upon
her
canvas
then
as
her
original
impetus
kept
her
going
the
canvas
boomed
seeming
to
his
straining
and
oversensitive
ears
like
cannon
firing
this
time
the
wind
was
catching
her
from
what
was
for
her
a
completely
unnatural
direction
from
dead
ahead
as
a
result
the
sails
filled
out
backwards
and
their
middle
portions
pressed
against
the
masts
the
came
almost
to
a
stop
at
once
the
rigging
groaned
and
the
masts
themselves
creaked
loudly
then
they
were
bending
backwards
while
the
sailors
clinging
to
them
in
the
darkness
swore
under
their
breaths
and
clamped
down
desperately
on
their
handholds
gods
said
green
what
he
doing
quiet
said
a
nearby
man
the
miran
is
going
to
run
her
backwards
green
gasped
but
he
made
no
further
comment
trying
to
visualize
what
a
strange
sight
the
of
must
be
and
wishing
it
were
daylight
so
he
could
see
her
he
sympathized
with
the
helmsmen
who
had
to
act
against
their
entire
training
it
was
a
bad
enough
strain
for
them
to
try
to
sail
blindly
between
two
vessels
but
to
roll
in
reverse
they
would
have
to
put
the
helm
to
port
when
their
reflexes
cried
out
to
them
to
put
it
to
starboard
and
vice
versa
and
no
doubt
miran
was
aware
of
this
and
was
warning
them
about
it
every
few
seconds
green
began
to
see
what
was
happening
by
now
the
was
rolling
on
her
former
course
but
at
a
reduced
rate
because
the
sails
bellying
against
their
masts
would
not
offer
as
much
surface
to
the
wind
therefore
the
ving
vessels
would
by
now
be
almost
upon
them
since
the
merchant
ship
had
also
lost
much
ground
in
her
maneuver
in
one
or
two
minutes
the
ving
would
overtake
them
would
for
a
short
while
ride
side
by
side
with
them
then
would
pass
provided
of
course
that
miran
had
estimated
correctly
his
speed
and
rate
of
curve
in
turning
otherwise
they
might
even
now
expect
a
crash
from
the
foredeck
as
the
bow
of
the
ving
caught
them
oh
booxotr
prayed
the
steer
us
right
else
you
lose
your
most
devout
worshiper
miran
booxotr
green
recalled
was
the
god
of
madness
suddenly
a
hand
gripped
green
shoulder
it
was
the
captain
of
the
foretop
do
you
see
them
he
said
softly
they
a
blacker
black
than
the
night
green
strained
his
eyes
was
it
his
imagination
or
did
he
actually
see
something
moving
to
his
right
and
another
something
the
hint
of
a
hint
moving
to
his
left
whatever
it
was
or
illusion
miran
must
have
seen
it
also
his
voice
shattered
the
night
into
a
thousand
pieces
and
it
was
never
again
the
same
cannoneers
fire
suddenly
it
was
as
if
fireflies
had
been
in
hiding
and
had
swarmed
out
at
his
command
all
along
the
rails
little
lights
appeared
green
was
startled
even
though
he
knew
that
the
punks
had
been
concealed
beneath
baskets
so
that
the
vings
would
have
no
warning
at
all
then
the
fireflies
became
long
glowing
worms
as
the
fuses
took
flame
there
was
a
great
roar
and
the
ship
rocked
iron
demons
belched
flame
no
sooner
done
than
musketry
broke
out
like
a
hot
rash
all
over
the
ship
green
himself
was
part
of
this
blazing
away
at
the
vessel
momentarily
and
dimly
revealed
by
the
light
of
the
cannon
fire
darkness
fell
but
silence
was
gone
the
men
cheered
the
decks
trembled
as
the
big
wooden
trains
holding
the
cannon
were
run
back
to
the
ports
from
which
they
recoiled
as
for
the
pirates
there
was
no
answering
fire
not
at
first
they
must
have
been
taken
completely
by
surprise
miran
shouted
again
again
the
big
guns
roared
green
reloading
his
musket
found
that
he
was
bracing
himself
against
a
tendency
to
lean
to
the
right
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
he
could
comprehend
that
the
was
turning
in
that
direction
even
though
it
was
still
going
backwards
why
is
he
doing
that
he
shouted
fool
we
ca
roll
up
the
sails
stop
then
set
sail
again
we
be
right
where
we
started
sailing
backwards
we
have
to
turn
while
we
have
momentum
and
how
better
to
do
that
than
reverse
our
maneuver
we
swing
around
until
we
headed
in
our
original
direction
green
understood
now
the
vings
had
passed
them
therefore
they
were
in
no
danger
of
collision
with
them
and
they
could
continue
sailing
backwards
all
night
the
thing
to
do
now
would
be
to
cut
off
at
an
angle
so
that
at
daybreak
they
be
far
from
the
pirates
at
that
moment
cannonfire
broke
out
to
their
left
the
men
aboard
the
refrained
from
cheering
only
because
of
miran
threats
to
maroon
them
on
the
plain
if
they
did
anything
to
reveal
their
position
nevertheless
they
all
bared
their
teeth
in
silent
laughter
crafty
old
miran
had
sprung
his
best
trap
as
he
hoped
the
two
pirates
unaware
that
their
attacker
was
now
behind
them
were
shooting
each
other
let
them
bang
away
until
they
blow
each
other
chortled
the
ah
miran
what
a
tale
we
have
to
tell
in
the
taverns
when
we
get
to
port
for
five
minutes
the
intermittent
flashes
and
bellows
told
that
the
vings
were
still
hammering
away
then
the
dark
took
hold
again
apparently
the
two
had
either
recognized
each
other
or
else
had
decided
that
night
fighting
was
a
bad
business
and
had
steered
away
from
each
other
if
this
last
was
true
then
they
would
be
much
to
fear
for
one
ving
would
attack
the
merchant
by
itself
the
clouds
broke
and
the
big
and
the
little
moons
spread
brightness
everywhere
the
pirate
vessels
were
not
in
sight
nor
were
they
seen
when
dawn
broke
there
was
sail
half
a
mile
away
but
this
alarmed
no
one
except
the
untutored
green
because
they
recognized
its
shape
as
a
sister
it
was
a
merchant
from
the
nearby
city
of
dem
of
the
dukedom
of
potzihili
green
was
glad
they
could
sail
with
it
safety
in
numbers
but
no
miran
after
hailing
it
and
finding
that
it
also
was
going
to
estorya
ordered
every
bit
of
canvas
crowded
on
in
an
effort
to
race
away
from
it
is
he
crazy
groaned
green
to
a
sailor
like
a
replied
the
sailor
referring
to
a
foxlike
animal
that
dwelt
in
the
hills
we
must
get
to
estorya
first
if
we
would
realize
the
full
value
of
our
cargo
utter
featherbrained
folly
snarled
green
that
ship
does
carry
live
fish
it
ca
possibly
compete
with
us
no
but
we
other
things
to
sell
besides
it
in
miran
blood
if
he
saw
another
merchant
pass
him
he
come
down
sick
green
threw
his
hands
into
the
air
and
rolled
his
eyes
in
despair
then
he
went
back
to
work
there
was
much
to
do
yet
before
he
be
allowed
to
sleep
the
days
and
nights
passed
in
the
hard
routine
of
his
labor
and
the
alarms
and
excursions
that
occasionally
broke
up
the
routine
now
and
then
the
gig
was
launched
while
the
was
in
full
speed
and
it
sped
away
under
the
power
of
its
white
sail
it
would
be
loaded
with
hunters
who
would
chase
a
or
deer
or
pygmy
hog
until
it
became
exhausted
then
would
shoot
the
tired
animal
they
always
brought
back
plenty
of
fresh
meat
as
for
water
the
on
the
decks
were
full
because
it
rained
at
least
half
an
hour
at
every
noon
and
dusk
green
wondered
at
the
regularity
and
promptness
of
these
showers
the
clouds
would
appear
at
twelve
it
would
rain
for
thirty
to
sixty
minutes
then
the
sky
would
clear
again
it
was
all
very
nice
but
it
was
also
very
puzzling
sometimes
he
was
allowed
to
try
target
practice
from
the
crow
nest
on
the
grass
cats
or
the
huge
dire
dogs
these
latter
ran
in
packs
of
half
a
dozen
to
twenty
and
would
often
pace
the
howling
and
growling
and
sometimes
running
between
the
wheels
the
sailors
had
quite
a
few
tales
of
what
they
did
to
people
who
fell
overboard
or
were
wrecked
on
the
plains
green
shuddered
and
went
back
to
his
target
practice
though
he
ordinarily
was
against
shooting
animals
just
for
the
fun
of
it
he
had
no
compunction
about
putting
a
ball
through
these
creatures
ever
since
he
been
tormented
by
alzo
he
hated
dogs
with
a
passion
unbecoming
to
a
civilized
man
of
course
the
fact
that
every
canine
on
the
planet
instinctively
loathed
him
because
of
his
earthman
odor
and
did
his
best
to
sink
his
teeth
into
him
strengthened
reaction
his
legs
were
always
healing
from
bites
of
the
pets
aboard
often
the
would
cruise
through
grass
tall
as
a
man
knee
then
suddenly
it
would
pass
onto
one
of
those
tremendous
lawns
which
seemed
so
well
kept
green
had
never
ceased
puzzling
about
them
but
all
he
could
get
from
anyone
was
one
or
more
variations
of
the
fable
of
the
the
herbivore
bigger
than
two
ships
put
together
one
day
they
passed
a
wreck
its
burned
hulk
lay
sideways
on
the
ground
and
here
and
there
bones
gleamed
in
the
sun
green
expressed
surprise
that
the
masts
wheels
and
cannon
were
gone
he
was
told
that
those
had
been
taken
away
by
the
savages
who
roamed
the
plains
they
use
the
wheels
for
their
own
craft
which
are
really
nothing
but
large
sailing
platforms
you
might
say
amra
told
him
on
these
they
pitch
their
tents
and
their
fireplaces
and
from
them
they
go
forth
to
hunt
some
of
them
however
disdain
platforms
and
make
their
homes
upon
the
islands
green
smiled
but
said
nothing
about
that
fairy
story
because
disbelief
excited
these
people
even
amra
you
not
see
many
wrecks
she
continued
not
because
there
many
for
there
are
out
of
every
ten
that
leave
for
distant
breaks
you
can
expect
only
six
to
get
back
that
few
i
amazed
that
with
such
a
casualty
ratio
you
could
get
anybody
to
risk
his
fortune
and
life
you
forget
that
he
who
comes
back
is
many
times
richer
than
when
he
sailed
away
look
at
miran
he
is
taxed
heavily
at
every
port
of
call
he
is
taxed
even
more
heavily
in
his
home
port
and
he
has
to
split
with
the
clansmen
though
he
does
get
a
tenth
of
the
profit
of
every
cargo
despite
this
he
is
the
richest
man
in
quotz
richer
even
than
the
duke
yes
but
a
man
is
a
fool
to
take
risks
like
these
just
for
the
remote
chance
of
a
fortune
he
protested
then
he
stopped
after
all
for
what
other
reason
had
the
norsemen
gone
to
america
and
columbus
to
the
west
indies
or
why
were
so
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
earthmen
daring
the
perils
of
interstellar
space
what
about
himself
for
instance
he
left
a
stable
and
job
on
earth
as
a
specialist
in
raising
sea
crops
to
go
to
pushover
a
planet
of
albireo
he
expected
to
make
his
fortune
there
after
two
years
of
work
and
then
retire
if
only
that
accident
had
happened
of
course
some
of
the
pioneers
were
driven
by
the
profit
motive
there
was
such
a
thing
as
love
of
adventure
not
a
pure
love
however
even
the
most
adventurous
saw
eldorado
gleaming
somewhere
in
the
wilds
greed
conquered
more
frontiers
than
curiosity
you
think
the
ruins
of
would
not
be
rare
even
if
these
plains
are
vast
said
amra
breaking
in
on
his
reflections
but
the
savages
and
pirates
must
salvage
them
as
fast
as
they
made
your
pardon
mother
for
interrupting
said
grizquetr
i
heard
a
sailor
zoob
remark
on
that
very
thing
just
the
other
day
he
said
that
he
once
saw
a
that
had
been
gutted
by
pirates
he
supposed
it
was
three
days
journey
out
of
yeshkayavach
the
city
of
quartz
in
the
far
north
he
said
their
was
a
week
there
then
returned
on
the
same
route
but
when
they
came
to
where
the
wreck
had
been
it
was
gone
every
bit
of
it
even
the
bones
of
the
dead
sailors
were
missing
and
he
said
that
that
reminded
him
of
a
story
his
father
had
told
him
when
he
was
young
he
said
his
father
told
him
that
his
ship
had
once
almost
run
into
a
huge
uncharted
hole
in
the
plain
it
was
big
at
least
two
hundred
feet
across
and
earth
had
been
piled
up
outside
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
at
first
that
was
what
they
thought
it
was
a
volcano
just
beginning
even
though
they
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
on
the
xurdimur
then
they
met
a
ship
whose
men
had
seen
the
hole
made
it
was
caused
they
said
by
a
mighty
falling
star
a
meteor
commented
green
and
it
had
dug
that
great
hole
well
that
was
as
good
an
explanation
as
any
but
the
amazing
thing
was
that
when
they
came
by
that
very
spot
a
month
later
the
hole
was
gone
it
was
filled
up
and
smoothed
out
and
grass
was
growing
over
it
as
if
nothing
had
ever
broken
the
skin
of
the
earth
now
how
do
you
explain
that
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
than
ever
your
philosophies
dreamed
of
horatio
green
nonchalantly
replied
though
he
felt
as
though
he
was
quoting
exactly
right
amra
and
her
son
blinked
horatio
never
mind
this
sailor
said
that
it
was
probably
the
work
of
the
gods
who
labor
secretly
at
night
that
the
plain
may
stay
flat
and
clean
of
obstacles
so
their
true
worshipers
may
sail
upon
it
and
profit
thereby
will
the
wonders
of
rationalization
never
cease
said
green
he
rose
from
his
pile
of
furs
almost
time
for
my
watch
he
kissed
amra
the
maid
the
children
and
stepped
out
from
the
tent
he
walked
rather
carelessly
across
the
deck
absorbed
in
wondering
what
the
effect
would
be
upon
amra
if
he
told
her
his
true
origin
could
she
comprehend
the
concept
of
other
worlds
existing
by
the
hundreds
of
thousands
yet
so
distant
from
each
other
that
a
man
could
walk
steadily
for
a
million
years
and
still
not
get
halfway
from
earth
to
this
planet
of
hers
or
would
she
react
automatically
as
most
of
her
fellows
would
do
and
think
that
he
must
surely
be
a
demon
in
human
disguise
it
would
be
more
natural
for
her
to
prefer
the
latter
idea
if
you
looked
at
it
objectively
it
more
plausible
given
her
lack
of
scientific
knowledge
much
more
believable
too
somebody
bumped
him
jarred
out
of
his
reverie
he
automatically
apologized
in
english
do
curse
at
me
in
your
foreign
tongue
snarled
grazoot
the
plump
little
harpist
ezkr
was
standing
behind
grazoot
he
spoke
out
of
the
side
of
his
mouth
urging
the
bard
on
he
thinks
he
can
walk
all
over
you
grazoot
because
he
insulted
your
harp
once
and
you
let
him
get
away
with
it
grazoot
puffed
out
his
cheeks
reddened
in
the
face
and
glared
it
is
only
because
miran
has
forbidden
duels
that
i
have
not
plunged
my
dagger
into
this
son
of
an
green
looked
from
one
to
the
other
obviously
this
scene
was
prearranged
with
no
good
end
for
him
in
view
stand
aside
he
said
haughtily
you
are
interfering
with
the
discipline
of
the
miran
will
not
like
that
indeed
said
grazoot
do
you
think
miran
cares
at
all
about
what
happens
to
you
you
a
lousy
sailor
and
it
hurts
me
to
have
to
call
you
brother
in
fact
i
spit
every
time
i
say
it
to
you
brother
grazoot
did
just
that
green
who
was
downwind
felt
the
fine
mist
wet
his
legs
he
began
to
get
angry
out
of
my
way
or
i
report
you
to
the
first
mate
he
said
firmly
and
walked
by
them
they
gave
way
but
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
in
the
small
of
his
back
as
if
a
knife
would
plunge
into
it
of
course
they
should
be
so
foolish
because
they
would
be
hamstrung
and
then
dropped
off
the
for
the
crime
of
cowardice
but
these
people
were
so
they
were
just
as
likely
as
not
to
stab
him
in
a
moment
of
fury
once
on
the
rope
ladder
that
ran
up
to
the
crow
nest
he
began
to
lose
the
prickly
feeling
in
his
back
at
that
moment
grazoot
called
out
oh
green
i
had
a
vision
last
night
a
true
vision
because
my
patron
god
sent
it
and
he
himself
appeared
in
it
he
announced
that
he
would
snuff
up
his
nostrils
the
welcome
scent
of
your
blood
spilled
all
over
the
deck
from
your
fall
green
paused
with
one
foot
on
the
rail
you
tell
your
god
to
stay
away
from
me
or
i
punch
him
in
the
nose
he
called
back
there
was
a
gasp
from
the
many
people
who
gathered
around
to
listen
sacrilege
yelled
grazoot
blasphemy
he
turned
to
those
around
him
did
you
hear
that
yes
said
ezkr
stepping
out
from
the
crowd
i
heard
him
and
i
am
shocked
men
have
burned
for
less
oh
my
patron
god
tonuscala
punish
this
man
make
your
dreams
come
true
cast
him
headlong
from
the
mast
and
dash
him
to
the
deck
and
break
every
bone
in
his
body
so
that
men
may
learn
that
one
does
not
mock
the
true
gods
murmured
the
crowd
amen
green
smiled
grimly
he
had
fallen
into
their
trap
and
now
must
be
on
guard
plainly
one
or
both
of
them
would
be
aloft
tonight
during
the
dark
hour
after
sunset
and
they
be
content
with
nothing
less
than
pitching
him
out
over
the
deck
his
death
would
be
considered
to
have
come
from
the
hands
of
an
outraged
god
and
if
amra
should
accuse
ezkr
and
grazoot
she
get
little
justice
as
for
miran
the
fellow
would
probably
heave
a
sigh
of
relief
because
he
be
rid
of
a
troublesome
fellow
who
could
carry
damaging
stories
of
a
certain
conspiracy
to
the
duke
of
tropat
he
climbed
up
to
the
crow
nest
and
settled
gloomily
to
staring
off
at
the
horizon
just
before
sunset
grizquetr
came
up
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
food
in
a
covered
basket
between
bites
green
told
the
boy
of
his
suspicions
mother
has
already
guessed
as
much
said
the
lad
she
is
a
very
clever
woman
indeed
my
mother
she
has
put
a
curse
upon
the
two
if
you
should
come
to
harm
very
clever
that
will
do
a
great
deal
of
good
thank
her
for
her
splendid
work
while
you
picking
up
my
pieces
from
the
deck
will
you
to
be
sure
replied
grizquetr
trying
hard
to
keep
his
sober
face
from
breaking
into
a
grin
and
mother
also
sent
you
this
he
rolled
the
kerchief
all
the
way
off
the
top
of
the
basket
eyes
widened
a
rocket
flare
yes
mother
says
that
you
are
to
release
it
when
you
hear
the
whistle
from
the
deck
now
why
in
the
world
would
i
do
that
wo
i
get
into
tremendous
trouble
by
doing
that
i
be
run
through
the
gauntlet
a
dozen
times
for
that
no
sir
not
me
i
seen
those
poor
fellows
after
the
whips
were
through
with
them
mother
said
for
me
to
tell
you
that
nobody
will
be
able
to
prove
who
sent
up
the
flare
perhaps
it
sounds
reasonable
but
why
should
i
do
it
it
will
light
up
the
whole
ship
for
a
minute
and
everybody
will
be
able
to
see
that
ezkr
and
grazoot
are
in
the
rigging
the
whole
ship
will
be
in
an
uproar
of
course
when
it
is
discovered
that
somebody
has
stolen
two
flares
from
the
and
when
a
search
is
conducted
and
one
flare
is
found
hidden
in
ezkr
trunk
then
well
you
see
oh
beamish
boy
chortled
green
calloo
callay
go
tell
your
mother
she
the
most
marvelous
woman
on
this
planet
though
that
really
not
much
of
a
compliment
now
i
think
of
it
oh
wait
a
minute
about
this
whistle
now
why
should
he
be
warning
me
to
send
up
a
flare
he
wo
mother
will
be
blowing
it
she
be
waiting
for
a
signal
from
me
or
azaxu
grizquetr
said
referring
to
his
younger
brother
we
be
watching
ezkr
and
grazoot
and
when
they
start
to
climb
aloft
we
notify
her
she
wait
until
she
thinks
they
about
halfway
up
then
she
whistle
that
woman
has
saved
my
life
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
what
would
i
do
without
her
that
what
mother
said
she
said
that
she
does
know
why
she
went
after
you
when
you
tried
to
run
away
from
her
from
us
because
she
has
great
pride
and
she
does
have
to
chase
a
man
to
get
one
princes
have
begged
her
to
come
live
with
them
but
she
did
because
she
loves
you
and
a
good
thing
too
otherwise
your
stupidity
would
have
killed
you
ten
times
over
by
now
oh
she
did
did
she
well
hah
hum
yes
well
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
yet
angry
at
amra
for
her
estimate
of
him
green
miserably
watched
grizquetr
climb
down
the
ratlines
during
the
next
time
seemed
to
coagulate
to
thicken
and
harden
around
him
so
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
encased
in
it
the
clouds
that
always
came
up
after
sunset
formed
and
a
light
drizzle
began
it
would
last
for
about
an
hour
he
knew
then
the
clouds
would
disappear
so
swiftly
that
they
would
give
the
impression
of
being
yanked
away
like
a
tablecloth
by
some
magician
over
the
horizon
but
he
cram
a
highly
nervous
lifetime
into
those
minutes
wondering
if
perhaps
there
would
be
some
unforeseen
frustration
of
schedule
the
first
webby
drops
struck
his
face
and
he
wondered
if
perhaps
that
would
be
what
the
two
would
wait
for
they
probably
taken
the
first
step
up
the
rigging
but
he
must
expect
her
whistle
for
some
time
yet
if
they
were
clever
they
would
climb
up
directly
beneath
him
but
would
go
aft
ascend
to
the
top
then
climb
over
to
him
it
was
true
that
they
have
to
pass
others
who
like
green
were
also
stationed
aloft
on
watch
but
ezkr
and
grazoot
knew
the
locations
of
these
so
dark
was
it
they
could
pass
within
touching
distance
and
not
be
seen
or
heard
the
wind
in
the
rigging
the
creak
of
masts
the
rumble
of
the
great
wheels
would
drown
out
any
slight
noise
they
might
make
the
did
not
stop
sailing
just
because
the
helmsmen
could
not
see
the
followed
a
route
every
permanent
obstacle
along
here
had
been
memorized
by
helmsmen
and
officers
alike
if
anything
formidable
was
expected
in
their
path
during
the
dark
period
a
course
would
be
set
to
avoid
it
the
officers
on
duty
would
advise
the
helmsmen
on
their
steering
by
means
of
an
ingenious
dial
on
a
notched
plate
his
sensitive
fingers
following
its
flickerings
back
and
forth
and
comparing
them
with
the
directional
notches
would
tell
him
how
close
to
the
course
they
were
keeping
the
dial
itself
was
fixed
to
the
needle
of
a
compass
beneath
it
green
hunched
his
shoulders
beneath
his
coat
and
walked
around
the
walls
of
his
nest
he
strained
his
eyes
to
make
out
something
in
the
blackness
that
wrapped
him
around
like
a
shroud
there
was
nothing
nothing
at
all
no
wait
what
was
that
a
vague
outline
of
a
white
face
he
stared
hard
until
it
disappeared
then
he
sighed
and
realized
how
rigidly
he
been
standing
there
and
of
course
he
been
open
to
attack
from
behind
all
that
time
no
not
really
if
he
could
see
an
arm
length
away
neither
could
the
other
two
but
they
did
have
to
see
they
knew
the
ropes
so
well
that
they
could
grope
blindfolded
to
his
nest
and
there
feel
him
out
a
touch
of
a
finger
followed
by
a
thrust
of
steel
that
would
be
all
it
would
take
he
was
thinking
of
that
when
he
felt
the
finger
it
poked
into
his
back
and
held
him
like
a
statue
for
just
a
second
quivering
paralyzed
then
he
gave
a
hoarse
cry
and
jumped
away
he
snatched
out
his
dagger
and
crouched
down
close
to
the
floor
straining
his
eyes
and
ears
trying
to
detect
them
surely
if
they
were
breathing
as
hard
as
he
he
could
fail
to
hear
them
on
the
other
hand
he
realized
with
a
sudden
sickishness
they
could
hear
him
just
as
well
come
on
come
on
he
said
soundlessly
through
clenched
teeth
do
something
make
a
move
so
i
can
pin
you
you
sons
of
perhaps
they
were
doing
the
same
waiting
for
him
to
betray
himself
the
best
thing
was
to
hug
the
floor
where
he
was
and
hope
stumble
over
him
he
kept
reaching
out
in
front
of
him
feeling
for
the
warm
flesh
of
a
face
his
other
hand
held
his
dagger
it
was
during
one
of
his
tentative
explorations
that
he
felt
the
basket
where
grizquetr
had
left
it
at
once
seized
with
what
he
thought
was
an
inspiration
he
pulled
out
the
flare
why
wait
for
them
to
close
in
on
him
and
butcher
him
like
a
hog
he
send
up
the
flare
now
and
in
the
first
shock
of
its
glare
he
attack
them
the
only
trouble
was
he
have
to
put
down
his
dagger
in
order
to
take
his
flint
and
steel
and
tinderbox
from
his
pocket
he
hated
not
to
have
it
ready
for
thrusting
solving
this
problem
by
putting
the
dagger
between
his
teeth
he
took
out
his
firebox
paused
and
swiftly
put
them
back
now
how
was
he
supposed
to
get
the
tinder
going
when
it
was
drizzling
that
was
one
thing
amra
with
all
her
cleverness
had
thought
of
fool
he
whispered
to
himself
i
the
fool
and
in
the
next
moment
he
was
removing
his
coat
and
putting
the
flint
and
steel
and
box
under
its
protecting
cover
he
could
see
what
he
was
doing
but
if
he
held
the
tinder
close
enough
a
spark
should
fall
on
it
then
have
a
flame
hot
enough
to
touch
off
the
fuse
of
the
flare
again
he
froze
his
enemies
were
waiting
for
him
to
reveal
himself
through
noise
what
better
giveaway
than
flint
scraping
against
steel
and
what
about
the
sound
of
the
rocket
flare
spiked
support
being
driven
into
the
wooden
floor
he
suppressed
a
groan
no
matter
what
he
did
he
was
leaving
himself
wide
open
it
was
then
that
the
shrillness
of
a
whistle
below
startled
him
he
rose
wondering
frenziedly
what
he
should
do
next
so
convinced
was
he
that
ezkr
and
grazoot
were
poised
just
outside
the
nest
he
could
not
believe
that
amra
had
not
misjudged
the
time
it
had
taken
them
to
climb
to
him
or
that
she
had
not
been
held
up
for
some
reason
and
now
was
frantically
trying
to
warn
him
but
he
realized
he
could
just
stand
there
like
a
scared
sheep
whether
amra
was
right
or
not
whether
they
were
within
dagger
thrust
or
not
he
had
to
take
action
do
your
damndest
he
growled
at
whatever
might
be
in
the
dark
and
he
struck
steel
against
flint
the
materials
were
under
his
coat
blocking
his
view
but
he
lay
down
again
so
he
could
see
between
his
arms
and
under
the
coat
held
over
them
the
tinder
caught
at
once
and
blazed
up
then
began
a
small
but
steady
glow
in
the
harder
wood
of
the
box
without
waiting
to
look
around
green
rammed
the
flare
spike
into
the
deck
of
the
nest
swiftly
he
brought
the
punk
up
still
holding
the
coat
over
it
for
protection
from
the
drizzle
and
also
from
any
watching
eyes
he
held
it
against
the
fuse
saw
the
cord
catch
flame
and
sizzle
like
a
frying
worm
then
he
had
ducked
around
the
other
side
of
the
mast
that
supported
the
nest
for
he
knew
how
unpredictable
these
primitive
rockets
were
like
as
not
it
would
go
off
in
his
face
hardly
had
he
rounded
the
big
pillar
of
the
mast
when
he
heard
a
soft
whooshing
sound
he
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
the
rocket
explode
in
a
white
glare
the
moment
it
dispelled
the
darkness
he
jerked
his
head
to
the
right
and
the
left
in
an
effort
to
see
if
ezkr
and
grazoot
were
on
him
as
he
they
must
be
but
they
were
they
were
still
half
a
ship
length
away
from
him
caught
by
the
light
in
the
rigging
like
flies
in
a
spider
web
what
he
had
thought
was
a
finger
poking
him
in
the
back
must
have
been
the
bolt
that
held
the
support
for
the
muskets
which
were
to
be
fired
from
the
nest
during
combat
so
relieved
was
he
he
would
have
broken
into
loud
laughter
but
at
that
moment
a
great
cry
broke
from
the
decks
below
the
mate
and
the
helmsmen
were
shouting
in
alarm
green
looked
down
saw
them
pointing
and
his
gaze
followed
the
direction
of
their
extended
fingers
a
hundred
yards
ahead
rushing
at
them
on
a
collision
course
was
a
towering
clump
of
trees
then
the
flare
had
died
and
had
left
nothing
but
its
on
the
eye
and
panic
on
the
brain
green
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
in
the
first
instant
he
had
thought
that
it
was
the
alone
that
was
speeding
toward
an
uncharted
hill
immediately
after
he
seen
that
his
senses
were
deceiving
him
and
that
the
mass
was
also
moving
it
had
looked
like
a
hill
or
several
hills
sliding
across
the
grass
toward
them
but
even
as
the
darkness
came
back
he
seen
that
there
were
other
hills
behind
it
and
that
the
whole
thing
was
actually
a
sort
of
iceberg
of
rocks
and
of
soil
from
which
grew
trees
that
was
all
he
could
make
out
in
that
confusing
moment
even
then
he
could
believe
it
because
a
mountain
just
did
run
along
of
its
own
volition
on
flat
land
credible
or
not
it
was
not
being
ignored
by
the
helmsmen
they
must
have
turned
the
wheel
almost
at
once
for
green
could
feel
the
leaning
of
the
mast
to
port
and
the
shift
of
wind
upon
his
face
the
was
swinging
to
the
southwest
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
roaming
island
unfortunately
it
was
too
dark
for
the
men
to
have
worked
swiftly
in
trimming
the
sails
even
if
a
full
crew
had
been
aloft
and
there
were
far
too
few
on
the
top
as
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
have
them
on
duty
when
the
was
running
in
the
drizzle
green
had
time
for
one
short
prayer
no
nonsense
about
punching
a
god
in
the
nose
now
and
then
he
was
hurled
against
the
wall
of
the
nest
there
was
the
loudest
noise
he
ever
heard
the
loudest
because
it
was
the
crack
of
doom
for
him
rope
split
like
a
giant
whip
cracking
spars
suddenly
released
from
the
rigging
strummed
like
monster
violins
the
masts
falling
down
thundered
intermingled
with
all
that
were
the
screams
of
the
people
below
on
the
deck
and
in
the
holds
green
himself
was
screaming
as
he
felt
the
foremast
lean
over
and
he
slid
from
the
floor
of
the
nest
which
had
suddenly
threatened
to
become
a
wall
and
fought
to
hold
himself
on
the
wall
which
had
now
become
a
floor
his
fingers
closed
upon
the
with
the
desperation
of
one
who
clings
to
the
only
solid
thing
in
the
world
for
a
minute
the
mast
stopped
its
forward
movement
held
taut
by
the
tangled
mass
of
ropes
green
hoped
that
he
was
safe
that
all
the
damage
had
been
done
but
no
even
as
he
dared
think
he
might
come
out
alive
the
mighty
grinding
noise
began
again
the
island
of
rock
and
trees
was
continuing
its
course
and
was
smashing
the
hull
of
the
ship
beneath
it
gobbling
up
wheels
axles
keel
timber
cargo
cannon
and
people
the
next
he
knew
he
was
flying
through
the
air
torn
from
his
hold
catapulted
far
away
from
the
it
seemed
as
if
he
actually
soared
gained
altitude
though
this
must
have
been
an
illusion
then
the
hard
return
to
earth
the
impact
on
his
face
his
body
his
legs
the
outstretched
arms
to
soften
the
blow
that
must
surely
splinter
his
bones
and
pulp
his
flesh
the
pitiful
arms
the
last
gesture
before
annihilation
the
series
of
hard
blows
like
many
fists
the
sudden
realization
that
he
was
among
tree
branches
and
that
his
fall
was
being
broken
by
them
his
trying
to
grab
one
to
hang
on
and
its
slipping
away
and
his
continued
rapid
and
punishing
descent
then
oblivion
he
did
know
how
long
he
been
unconscious
but
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
through
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
shattered
hull
of
the
about
a
hundred
feet
away
it
was
lying
on
its
side
on
a
lower
level
than
he
was
so
he
supposed
that
he
was
sitting
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
only
half
of
the
craft
was
in
sight
it
must
have
been
broken
in
two
and
most
of
the
middeck
and
stern
ground
into
rubble
beneath
the
advancing
juggernaut
of
the
island
dully
he
realized
that
the
drizzle
had
stopped
the
clouds
had
cleared
and
the
big
and
little
moons
were
up
the
seeing
was
good
too
good
there
were
people
left
alive
in
the
wreck
men
women
and
children
who
were
trying
to
climb
through
the
tangle
of
ropes
spars
and
broken
jagged
projecting
planks
screams
moans
shouts
and
calls
for
help
made
a
chaos
groaning
he
managed
to
rise
to
his
feet
he
had
a
very
painful
headache
one
eye
was
so
swollen
he
could
see
with
it
he
tasted
blood
in
his
mouth
and
felt
several
broken
teeth
with
his
lacerated
tongue
his
sides
hurt
when
he
breathed
the
skin
seemed
to
have
been
torn
off
the
palms
of
his
hands
his
right
knee
must
have
been
wrenched
and
his
left
heel
was
a
ball
of
fire
nevertheless
he
got
up
amra
and
paxi
and
her
other
children
were
in
there
that
is
unless
they
been
caught
in
the
other
half
he
had
to
find
out
even
if
they
were
beyond
his
help
there
were
others
who
were
he
started
to
hobble
through
the
trees
then
he
saw
a
man
step
out
from
behind
a
bush
thinking
that
he
must
be
a
survivor
who
had
wandered
off
in
a
dazed
condition
green
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
to
him
but
there
was
something
odd
about
him
that
imposed
silence
he
looked
closer
yes
the
fellow
wore
a
headdress
of
feathers
and
held
a
long
spear
in
his
hand
and
the
moonlight
where
it
slipped
through
the
branches
and
shone
upon
an
exposed
shoulder
gleamed
red
white
yellow
and
green
the
man
was
painted
all
over
with
stripes
of
different
colors
green
slowly
sank
down
upon
his
hands
and
knees
behind
a
bush
it
was
then
that
he
became
aware
of
others
who
stood
behind
trees
and
watched
the
wreck
then
these
emerged
from
the
darkness
under
the
branches
presently
at
least
fifty
plumed
painted
armed
men
were
gathered
together
all
silent
all
intently
inspecting
the
wreck
and
the
survivors
one
raised
a
spear
as
a
signal
and
gave
a
loud
whooping
war
cry
the
others
echoed
him
and
when
he
ran
out
from
beneath
the
branches
they
followed
him
green
could
watch
only
for
a
minute
before
he
had
to
close
his
eyes
no
no
he
moaned
the
children
too
when
he
forced
himself
to
look
again
he
saw
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
thinking
that
everybody
had
been
put
to
spear
after
the
first
vicious
onslaught
in
which
they
killed
indiscriminately
and
hysterically
like
all
undisciplined
primitives
they
spared
the
younger
women
and
the
little
girls
those
able
to
walk
were
lined
up
and
marched
off
under
the
guard
of
half
a
dozen
spearsmen
the
too
badly
injured
were
run
through
on
the
spot
even
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
green
felt
some
of
his
intense
anguish
eased
a
little
amra
was
still
alive
she
held
paxi
in
one
arm
and
with
the
other
pulled
soon
her
daughter
by
the
temple
sculptor
though
she
must
have
been
terribly
frightened
she
faced
her
captors
with
the
same
proud
bearing
she
always
had
whether
in
the
presence
of
peasant
or
prince
inzax
her
maid
stood
behind
her
green
decided
that
he
better
try
to
follow
her
and
her
captors
at
a
discreet
distance
but
before
he
could
get
away
he
saw
the
women
and
older
children
of
the
savages
appear
bearing
torches
fortunately
none
came
his
way
some
of
these
mutilated
the
dead
dancing
around
the
hacked
corpses
and
howling
in
imitation
of
the
adult
men
then
began
the
work
in
earnest
the
carving
up
of
the
flesh
these
painted
people
were
cannibals
and
made
no
bones
about
it
fires
were
being
lit
for
a
midnight
snack
before
the
bulk
of
the
meat
was
brought
back
to
wherever
their
homes
were
green
stayed
far
enough
behind
the
prisoners
and
savages
to
keep
out
of
sight
if
any
man
should
turn
the
path
was
narrow
winding
between
crowding
trunks
and
under
low
branches
the
soil
underfoot
was
rich
and
springy
as
if
composed
of
generations
of
leaves
green
estimated
he
must
have
gone
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half
not
as
the
crow
flies
but
more
like
a
drunk
trying
to
find
his
way
home
then
without
warning
the
forest
stopped
and
a
clearing
was
before
him
in
the
midst
of
this
stood
a
village
of
about
ten
log
houses
with
thatched
roofs
six
were
rather
small
outhouses
serving
one
purpose
or
another
the
four
large
ones
were
he
guessed
long
houses
for
community
living
they
were
grouped
about
a
central
spot
in
which
were
the
remains
of
several
large
fires
beneath
big
iron
pots
and
spits
clay
tanks
were
scattered
here
and
there
these
held
rain
water
before
each
house
was
a
totem
pole
brightly
painted
and
around
it
many
slender
poles
holding
skulls
the
prisoners
were
led
into
one
of
the
outhouses
and
the
door
barred
a
man
stationed
himself
at
the
front
squatting
with
his
back
to
the
wall
and
holding
a
spear
in
one
hand
the
others
greeted
the
old
women
and
younger
children
who
had
been
left
behind
though
they
spoke
in
a
language
green
did
understand
they
were
obviously
describing
what
they
found
at
the
wreck
some
of
the
old
crones
then
began
piling
brushwood
and
small
logs
under
one
of
the
huge
iron
kettles
presently
they
had
a
fire
blazing
brightly
others
brought
out
glasses
and
cups
of
precious
metals
loot
from
wrecks
these
they
filled
with
some
sort
of
liquor
probably
a
native
beer
judging
from
the
foam
that
spilled
over
the
sides
one
of
the
young
boys
began
idly
tapping
upon
a
drum
and
soon
was
beating
out
a
monotonous
simple
rhythm
it
looked
as
if
they
were
going
to
make
a
night
of
it
but
after
a
few
drinks
the
warriors
arose
picked
up
jugs
of
liquor
and
walked
into
the
woods
leaving
one
man
to
guard
the
prisoners
hut
all
the
children
over
the
age
of
four
left
with
them
trailing
along
in
the
dark
though
the
warriors
made
no
effort
to
slow
their
pace
so
the
children
could
keep
up
green
waited
until
he
was
sure
the
spearsmen
were
some
distance
away
then
rose
his
muscles
protested
at
any
movement
and
pains
shot
through
his
head
knee
and
ankle
but
he
ignored
them
and
limped
around
the
edge
of
the
clearing
until
he
came
to
the
back
of
one
of
the
long
houses
he
slipped
inside
and
stood
by
the
side
of
the
doorway
it
was
more
illuminated
than
he
thought
at
first
because
of
the
several
large
and
open
windows
which
admitted
moonbeams
hens
sleepily
clucked
at
him
and
one
of
the
midget
pigs
grunted
questioningly
suddenly
something
soft
brushed
across
his
ankles
startled
he
jumped
to
one
side
his
heart
which
had
been
beating
fast
enough
before
threatened
to
hammer
a
hole
in
his
ribs
he
crouched
straining
to
see
what
it
was
then
a
soft
meowing
nearby
told
him
he
relaxed
a
little
and
stretched
out
a
hand
saying
here
kitty
kitty
come
here
but
the
cat
walked
by
his
tail
raised
and
a
look
of
disdain
on
his
face
as
he
disappeared
through
the
door
seeing
the
animal
reminded
green
of
something
about
which
he
was
anxious
that
was
whether
the
natives
kept
dogs
or
not
he
had
seen
any
and
thought
that
surely
if
there
were
some
he
have
long
ago
heard
the
noisy
beasts
undoubtedly
by
now
he
should
have
a
whole
pack
of
the
obnoxious
monsters
snarling
at
his
heels
silently
he
walked
into
the
long
single
room
with
its
high
ceiling
from
thick
rafters
hung
curtains
which
he
supposed
would
be
let
down
to
make
a
room
for
any
families
that
wished
it
from
them
also
hung
vegetables
fruit
and
meat
chickens
rabbits
piglets
squirrels
and
venison
there
were
no
human
parts
so
he
guessed
that
the
flesh
of
man
was
not
so
much
a
staple
diet
to
these
people
as
a
food
for
religious
purposes
all
he
did
know
was
that
he
would
have
to
take
some
meat
with
him
he
gathered
strips
of
dried
rolled
them
into
a
ball
and
stuffed
them
in
a
bag
then
he
took
down
an
spear
and
a
sharp
steel
knife
from
their
rack
on
the
wall
knife
in
belt
and
spear
in
hand
he
went
out
the
back
door
outside
he
stopped
to
listen
to
the
beating
of
drums
and
the
chanting
of
voices
there
must
be
quite
a
celebration
around
the
wreck
good
he
muttered
to
himself
if
they
get
drunk
and
pass
out
have
time
for
what
i
want
to
do
staying
well
within
the
shadows
of
the
trees
he
picked
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
hut
in
which
the
prisoners
were
from
where
he
stood
he
could
see
that
there
were
only
six
old
women
about
all
the
economy
could
afford
he
supposed
and
some
ten
infants
all
toddlers
most
of
these
once
the
excitement
caused
by
the
noisy
warriors
had
subsided
with
their
leavetaking
had
lain
down
close
to
the
fire
and
gone
to
sleep
the
only
one
who
might
give
real
trouble
aside
from
the
guard
was
a
boy
of
ten
the
one
who
was
now
tapping
softly
on
the
drum
at
first
green
could
not
understand
why
he
had
gone
with
the
others
of
his
age
to
the
wreck
but
the
empty
stare
and
the
unblinking
way
he
looked
into
the
fire
showed
why
green
had
no
doubt
that
if
he
were
to
come
close
enough
to
the
lad
he
see
that
the
eyeballs
were
filmed
over
with
white
blindness
was
nothing
rare
on
this
filthy
planet
satisfied
as
to
everybody
location
he
crept
to
the
back
of
the
hut
and
examined
the
walls
they
were
made
of
thick
poles
driven
into
the
ground
and
bound
together
with
rope
taken
from
a
rigging
there
were
plenty
of
openings
for
him
to
look
through
but
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
see
only
the
vague
outlines
moving
about
he
put
his
mouth
to
one
of
the
holes
and
said
softly
amra
somebody
gasped
a
little
girl
began
to
cry
but
was
quickly
hushed
up
amra
answered
faint
with
joy
alan
it
ca
be
i
am
not
thy
father
ghost
he
replied
and
wondered
at
the
same
time
how
he
could
manage
to
inject
any
levity
at
all
into
the
midst
of
this
desperate
situation
he
was
always
doing
it
perhaps
it
was
not
the
product
of
a
true
humor
but
more
like
the
giggle
of
a
person
who
was
embarrassed
or
under
some
other
stress
more
the
result
of
hysteria
than
anything
else
his
particular
type
of
safety
valve
here
what
i
going
to
do
he
said
listen
carefully
then
repeat
it
after
me
so
i
know
you
have
it
down
she
had
to
hear
it
only
once
to
give
it
back
to
him
he
nodded
good
girl
i
going
now
alan
yes
he
replied
impatiently
if
this
does
work
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
or
me
remember
that
i
love
you
he
sighed
even
in
the
midst
of
this
the
eternal
feminine
emerged
i
love
you
too
but
that
has
got
much
to
do
with
this
situation
before
she
could
answer
and
waste
more
valuable
time
he
slid
away
crawling
on
all
fours
around
the
corner
of
the
hut
when
he
was
where
one
more
pace
would
have
brought
him
into
view
of
the
guard
and
the
old
crones
he
stopped
all
this
while
he
been
counting
the
seconds
as
soon
as
he
clocked
five
minutes
which
he
thought
would
never
pass
he
rose
and
stepped
swiftly
around
the
corner
spear
held
in
front
of
him
the
guard
was
drinking
out
of
his
mug
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
throat
exposed
he
fell
over
with
green
spear
plunged
through
his
windpipe
just
above
the
breastbone
the
mug
fell
onto
his
lap
and
gushed
its
amber
and
foam
over
his
legs
green
withdrew
the
blade
and
whirled
ready
to
run
upon
anybody
who
started
to
flee
but
the
old
women
were
huddled
on
their
knees
around
a
large
board
on
which
they
were
rolling
some
flour
cackling
and
talking
shrilly
the
blind
boy
continued
tapping
his
open
eyes
glaring
into
the
fire
only
one
saw
green
a
boy
of
about
three
thumb
in
mouth
he
stared
with
great
round
eyes
at
this
stranger
but
he
was
either
too
horrified
to
utter
a
sound
or
else
he
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
and
was
waiting
to
find
out
his
elders
reactions
before
he
offered
his
own
green
lifted
one
finger
to
his
lips
in
the
universal
sign
of
silence
then
turned
and
lifted
up
the
bar
over
the
door
amra
rushed
out
and
took
the
guard
spear
from
her
husband
the
dead
man
knife
went
to
inzax
and
his
other
knife
to
aga
a
tall
muscular
woman
who
was
captain
of
the
female
deck
hands
and
who
had
once
killed
a
sailor
while
defending
her
somewhat
dubious
honor
at
the
same
time
the
chattering
of
the
hags
stopped
green
whirled
around
and
the
silence
was
broken
by
shrieks
frantically
the
hags
tried
to
scramble
up
from
their
stiffened
knees
and
run
away
but
green
and
the
women
were
upon
them
before
they
could
take
more
than
a
few
steps
not
one
of
them
reached
the
forest
it
was
grim
work
one
in
which
the
effenycan
woman
took
fierce
joy
without
wasting
a
look
on
the
poor
old
carcasses
green
rounded
up
the
children
and
the
blind
boy
and
put
them
in
the
prisoners
hut
he
had
to
hold
aga
back
from
slaughtering
them
amra
he
was
pleased
to
see
had
made
no
motion
to
help
them
in
their
intended
butchery
she
understanding
his
brief
look
replied
i
could
not
kill
a
child
even
the
spawn
of
these
fiends
it
would
be
like
stabbing
paxi
green
saw
one
of
the
women
holding
his
daughter
he
ran
to
her
took
paxi
out
of
her
arms
and
kissed
the
baby
soon
amra
child
by
the
sculptor
came
shyly
and
stood
by
his
side
waiting
to
be
noticed
he
kissed
her
too
you
getting
to
be
a
big
girl
soon
he
said
do
you
suppose
you
could
tag
along
behind
your
mother
and
carry
paxi
for
her
she
has
to
carry
her
spear
the
girl
a
redheaded
beauty
nodded
and
took
the
baby
green
eyed
the
long
houses
with
the
idea
of
setting
them
afire
he
decided
not
to
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
wind
would
carry
sparks
to
the
hut
in
which
the
savages
children
were
moreover
though
a
fire
would
undoubtedly
create
consternation
among
the
roisterers
at
the
wreck
and
keep
them
busy
for
some
time
it
would
also
cause
them
to
start
tracking
down
the
refugees
just
that
much
sooner
besides
there
was
the
possibility
of
setting
fire
to
the
forest
wet
though
it
was
he
did
want
to
destroy
his
only
he
directed
some
women
to
go
into
the
long
house
and
load
themselves
with
as
much
food
and
weapons
as
they
could
carry
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
the
party
ready
to
leave
we
take
this
path
that
leads
out
of
the
village
away
from
the
path
that
goes
to
the
wreck
he
said
let
hope
it
goes
to
the
other
edge
of
the
island
where
we
may
find
some
small
on
which
we
can
escape
i
presume
these
savages
have
some
kind
of
sailing
craft
this
path
was
as
narrow
and
winding
as
the
other
one
it
worked
in
the
general
direction
of
the
western
shore
and
the
savages
were
on
the
eastern
shore
their
way
at
first
led
upward
sometimes
through
passes
formed
by
two
large
rocks
several
times
they
had
to
skirt
little
lakes
catch
basins
for
rain
once
a
fish
flopped
out
of
the
water
scaring
them
the
island
was
fairly
what
with
its
fish
rabbits
squirrels
wild
fowl
pigs
and
various
vegetables
and
fruit
he
estimated
that
if
the
village
was
in
the
center
of
the
island
then
the
mass
should
have
a
surface
area
of
about
one
and
a
half
square
miles
rough
though
the
land
was
and
thickly
covered
with
grass
the
place
should
offer
cover
for
one
refugee
for
one
yes
but
not
for
six
women
and
eight
children
after
much
puffing
and
panting
muttered
encouragements
to
each
other
and
occasional
cursing
they
finally
reached
the
summit
of
the
tallest
hill
abruptly
they
found
themselves
facing
a
clearing
which
ran
around
its
crown
directly
ahead
of
them
was
a
forest
of
totem
poles
all
gleaming
palely
in
the
moonlight
beyond
it
was
the
dark
yawning
of
a
large
cave
green
walked
out
from
the
shadows
of
the
branches
to
take
a
closer
look
when
he
came
back
he
said
there
a
little
hut
by
the
side
of
the
cave
i
looked
in
the
window
an
old
woman
asleep
in
it
but
her
cats
are
and
likely
to
wake
her
up
all
those
totem
poles
bear
the
heads
of
cats
said
aga
this
place
must
be
their
holy
of
holies
it
probably
taboo
to
all
but
the
old
priestess
maybe
so
replied
green
but
they
must
hold
religious
services
of
some
sort
here
there
a
big
pile
of
human
skulls
on
the
other
side
of
the
cave
mouth
and
also
a
stake
covered
with
bloodstains
we
can
do
two
things
go
on
down
the
other
side
of
this
hill
jump
off
onto
the
plain
and
take
our
chances
there
or
else
hide
inside
the
cave
and
hope
that
because
it
taboo
nobody
will
explore
it
to
look
for
us
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
place
they
look
into
said
aga
not
if
we
do
wake
the
old
woman
then
if
the
savages
come
along
later
and
ask
her
if
anybody
come
by
they
get
no
for
an
answer
what
about
the
cats
green
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
have
to
take
that
chance
perhaps
if
once
we
get
by
them
and
into
the
cave
they
may
quiet
down
he
was
referring
to
their
caterwauling
which
was
beginning
to
sound
dreadful
no
said
aga
that
noise
will
be
a
signal
to
the
islanders
know
something
up
well
replied
green
i
do
know
what
you
intend
doing
but
going
into
that
cave
i
too
tired
to
run
any
further
so
are
we
affirmed
the
other
women
we
reached
the
end
of
our
strength
there
was
a
silence
and
into
that
silence
came
a
voice
a
man
it
whispered
please
do
not
be
startled
be
quiet
it
is
i
miran
stepped
out
of
the
shadows
behind
them
holding
his
finger
to
his
lips
his
one
eye
round
and
pale
in
the
moonlight
he
was
a
ragged
captain
not
at
all
the
elegantly
uniformed
commander
of
the
of
and
the
patriarch
of
the
clan
effenycan
but
he
carried
in
his
other
hand
a
canvas
bag
green
seeing
it
knew
that
miran
had
managed
somehow
not
only
to
escape
with
his
skin
but
had
also
carried
off
a
treasure
in
jewels
behold
he
announced
waving
the
bag
all
is
not
lost
green
thought
that
he
was
referring
to
the
jewels
however
miran
had
turned
and
beckoned
to
someone
in
the
darkness
behind
him
out
of
it
slipped
grizquetr
tears
shone
in
his
eyes
as
he
ran
to
his
mother
and
fell
into
her
arms
amra
began
weeping
softly
until
now
she
had
repressed
her
grief
over
the
children
she
thought
forever
lost
to
her
all
thought
had
been
directed
to
saving
her
own
life
and
the
lives
of
the
two
girls
who
had
survived
with
her
now
seeing
her
eldest
son
emerge
from
the
shadows
as
if
from
the
grave
had
thawed
the
frozen
well
of
sorrow
she
sobbed
i
thank
the
gods
that
they
have
given
me
back
my
son
if
the
gods
are
so
wonderful
why
did
they
kill
your
other
two
children
asked
miran
sourly
and
why
did
they
kill
my
clansmen
and
why
did
they
smash
my
why
shut
up
said
green
this
is
no
time
to
cry
about
anything
we
have
to
get
out
with
whole
hides
the
philosophizing
and
tears
can
come
later
mennirox
is
an
ungrateful
god
muttered
miran
after
all
i
did
for
him
too
amra
dried
her
tears
and
said
how
did
you
escape
i
thought
all
the
males
who
had
been
killed
in
the
wreck
were
speared
almost
everybody
was
replied
grizquetr
but
i
crawled
down
into
the
hold
and
slipped
through
to
a
hiding
place
beneath
one
of
the
fish
tanks
which
had
overturned
it
was
wet
there
and
there
were
dead
fish
nestling
beside
me
the
savages
did
not
find
me
though
doubtless
they
would
have
when
they
began
salvaging
it
was
thinking
about
that
that
decided
me
to
crawl
back
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
away
from
the
savages
i
did
so
and
i
found
that
i
could
belly
my
way
through
the
grass
growing
on
the
edge
i
almost
died
of
fright
though
because
i
crawled
head
on
into
miran
he
was
hiding
there
too
i
was
thrown
off
the
foredeck
by
the
impact
interrupted
the
captain
i
should
have
broken
every
bone
in
my
body
but
i
landed
on
a
hull
sail
which
had
come
down
and
was
lying
on
the
starboard
side
supported
by
the
fallen
mast
it
was
like
falling
into
a
hammock
from
there
i
dropped
into
the
grass
and
snaked
along
the
very
edge
of
the
island
several
times
i
almost
fell
off
and
i
would
have
if
i
been
a
pound
fatter
an
inch
wider
as
it
was
listen
said
grizquetr
breaking
in
this
island
is
the
what
do
you
mean
said
green
while
i
was
clinging
to
the
edge
of
the
island
i
thought
i
hang
down
over
it
and
see
if
there
was
any
place
there
to
hide
there
was
because
the
underside
of
the
island
is
one
smooth
sheet
i
know
because
i
could
see
in
the
moonlight
clear
to
the
other
side
it
was
smooth
smooth
like
a
slab
of
iron
and
that
not
all
you
know
how
the
grass
on
the
plains
hereabouts
has
been
tall
uncut
well
the
grass
just
ahead
of
the
edge
was
uncut
but
the
grass
underneath
the
island
was
being
cut
off
rather
it
was
vanishing
the
top
of
the
grass
was
just
disappearing
into
air
only
a
lawn
of
grass
about
an
inch
high
was
left
then
this
island
one
big
lawnmower
said
green
more
than
just
interesting
but
we
have
to
investigate
that
later
right
now
and
he
walked
toward
the
little
hut
by
the
cave
mouth
as
he
approached
it
several
large
house
cats
streaked
out
of
the
doorway
a
moment
later
green
came
out
he
grinned
broadly
the
priestess
has
passed
out
the
place
smells
like
a
brewery
the
cats
are
in
their
cups
too
all
drinking
from
bowls
set
on
the
ground
for
them
staggering
around
yowling
fighting
if
they
do
wake
her
up
nothing
can
i
have
heard
that
these
old
priestesses
are
often
drunkards
said
amra
they
lead
a
lonely
life
because
they
taboo
and
nobody
even
goes
near
them
except
during
certain
religious
customs
they
have
only
their
bottle
and
their
cats
to
keep
them
company
ah
said
miran
you
are
thinking
of
the
tale
of
samdroo
the
tailor
who
turned
sailor
yes
that
is
supposed
to
be
a
story
to
entertain
children
but
i
beginning
to
think
there
is
a
great
deal
to
it
remember
the
story
describes
just
such
a
hill
and
just
such
a
cave
it
is
said
that
every
roaming
island
has
just
such
a
place
and
you
talk
too
much
broke
in
aga
harshly
let
get
on
into
the
cave
green
could
appreciate
what
aga
comment
meant
miran
had
lost
face
because
he
allowed
his
vessel
to
be
wrecked
and
his
clansmen
murdered
en
masse
to
aga
and
the
other
women
he
was
no
longer
captain
miran
the
rich
patriarch
he
was
miran
the
shipwrecked
sailor
a
fat
old
sailor
just
that
nothing
more
he
could
have
redeemed
himself
if
he
had
committed
suicide
but
his
eagerness
to
live
had
resulted
in
his
placing
himself
on
an
even
lower
level
in
their
estimation
miran
must
have
realized
this
for
he
did
not
reply
instead
he
stood
to
one
side
green
walked
thirty
paces
into
the
cave
then
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
the
entrance
was
still
visible
an
arch
outlined
in
the
bright
moonshine
someone
coughed
green
was
about
to
caution
them
to
keep
quiet
when
he
felt
his
nostrils
tickling
and
had
to
fight
to
down
a
loud
sneeze
himself
dust
good
said
green
maybe
they
never
come
down
here
suddenly
the
tunnel
turned
at
right
angles
to
the
left
the
little
light
that
penetrated
from
the
entrance
disappeared
in
total
blackness
the
party
halted
what
if
there
are
traps
set
for
intruders
wailed
inzax
that
a
chance
well
have
to
take
green
growled
we
go
in
the
dark
until
we
come
to
another
turn
then
we
light
up
a
torch
or
two
the
natives
wo
be
able
to
see
the
glow
he
walked
ahead
feeling
the
wall
with
his
left
hand
suddenly
he
stopped
amra
bumped
into
him
what
is
it
she
asked
anxiously
the
rock
wall
has
now
become
metal
feel
here
he
guided
her
hand
you
right
she
whispered
there
a
definite
seam
and
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
the
two
the
floor
metal
too
added
soon
my
feet
are
bare
and
i
can
feel
it
what
more
the
dust
is
all
gone
green
went
ahead
and
after
thirty
more
paces
he
came
to
another
turn
to
the
right
the
walls
and
floor
were
composed
of
the
smooth
cool
metal
after
making
sure
that
the
entire
party
was
around
the
corner
he
told
a
woman
carrying
some
torches
taken
from
a
long
house
to
light
one
its
bright
flare
showed
the
group
staring
at
the
large
chamber
in
which
they
stood
everywhere
were
bare
gray
metal
walls
and
floors
no
furniture
of
any
kind
nor
a
speck
of
dust
there
a
doorway
to
another
room
he
said
we
might
as
well
go
on
in
he
took
the
torch
from
the
woman
and
holding
a
cutlass
in
the
other
he
led
the
way
once
across
the
threshold
he
halted
this
room
was
even
larger
than
the
other
but
it
had
furnishings
of
a
sort
and
its
further
wall
was
not
metal
but
earth
at
the
same
time
the
room
began
to
brighten
with
light
coming
from
an
invisible
source
soon
screamed
and
threw
herself
against
her
mother
clinging
desperately
to
her
waist
the
babies
began
howling
and
the
other
adults
acted
in
the
various
ways
that
panic
affected
them
green
alone
remained
unmoved
he
knew
what
was
happening
but
he
could
blame
the
rest
for
their
behavior
they
had
never
heard
of
an
electronic
eye
so
they
could
be
expected
to
maintain
coolness
the
only
thing
that
green
feared
at
that
moment
was
that
the
outcries
would
be
heard
by
the
savages
outside
the
cave
so
he
hastened
to
assure
the
women
that
this
phenomenon
was
nothing
to
be
frightened
about
it
was
common
in
his
home
country
a
mere
matter
of
white
magic
that
anyone
could
practice
they
quieted
down
but
were
still
uneasy
they
bunched
up
about
him
the
natives
themselves
are
scared
of
this
he
said
they
must
come
here
at
times
see
there
an
altar
built
against
that
dirt
wall
and
from
the
bones
piled
beneath
it
i
say
that
sacrifices
were
held
here
he
looked
for
another
door
there
seemed
to
be
none
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
there
could
be
somehow
he
had
the
feeling
that
great
things
lay
ahead
of
him
these
rooms
and
this
lighting
were
evidences
of
an
earlier
civilization
that
quite
possibly
had
been
on
a
level
with
his
own
he
known
that
the
island
itself
must
be
powered
with
an
automatically
working
plant
fueled
either
atomically
or
from
the
planet
field
why
the
whole
unit
should
be
covered
with
rocks
and
soil
and
trees
he
did
know
but
he
had
been
sure
that
somewhere
in
the
bowels
of
this
mass
of
land
was
just
such
a
place
as
this
and
more
where
was
the
power
plant
was
it
sealed
up
so
that
no
one
could
get
to
it
or
as
was
likely
was
there
a
door
to
the
plant
which
could
not
be
opened
unless
one
had
a
key
of
some
sort
first
he
had
to
find
the
door
he
examined
the
altar
which
was
made
of
iron
it
was
a
platform
about
three
feet
high
and
ten
feet
square
upon
it
stood
a
chair
fashioned
from
pieces
of
iron
from
its
back
rose
a
steel
rod
about
half
an
inch
in
diameter
and
ten
feet
long
its
lower
end
held
secure
between
two
uprights
by
a
thick
iron
fork
once
the
fork
was
withdrawn
the
rod
would
obviously
fall
over
against
the
earth
wall
behind
it
though
the
lower
end
would
still
remain
on
the
uprights
and
would
in
fact
stick
against
whoever
was
sitting
in
the
chair
at
the
moment
odd
said
green
if
it
were
for
those
catheaded
idols
on
the
ends
of
the
platform
and
the
bones
at
its
foot
i
not
know
this
an
altar
bones
they
black
burned
black
he
looked
again
at
the
rod
now
he
said
half
to
himself
if
i
were
to
withdraw
the
fork
and
the
rod
fell
it
would
strike
the
wall
that
is
evident
but
what
is
it
all
about
amra
brought
him
some
long
pieces
of
rope
these
were
stacked
against
the
wall
she
said
yes
ah
now
if
i
were
to
tie
one
end
of
this
rope
about
the
apex
of
that
rod
and
someone
else
were
to
stand
upon
the
altar
and
take
out
the
fork
then
i
could
control
which
direction
the
rod
would
fall
by
pulling
it
toward
me
or
allowing
it
to
go
away
from
me
and
the
person
who
had
taken
the
fork
out
would
then
have
plenty
of
time
to
get
down
from
the
altar
and
back
to
the
region
of
safety
where
the
and
his
friends
would
be
stationed
alas
the
poor
fellow
sitting
in
the
chair
yes
i
see
it
all
now
he
looked
up
from
the
rope
he
held
in
his
hand
aga
he
said
sharply
get
away
from
that
wall
the
tall
lean
woman
was
walking
past
the
altar
holding
her
bare
cutlass
in
her
hand
when
she
heard
green
she
paused
in
her
stride
gave
him
an
astonished
look
then
continued
you
do
understand
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
this
wall
is
solid
earth
it
fluffy
like
a
young
chick
feathers
dust
dust
i
think
we
can
knock
it
down
cut
our
way
through
there
must
be
something
on
the
other
side
aga
he
yelled
do
stop
where
you
are
but
she
had
lifted
her
blade
and
brought
it
down
in
a
hard
stroke
that
was
to
show
him
how
easy
the
stuff
would
be
to
slash
away
green
grabbed
amra
and
paxi
and
dived
to
the
floor
pulling
them
with
him
thunder
roared
and
lightning
filled
the
room
dazzling
and
deafening
him
even
in
its
midst
he
could
see
the
dark
figure
of
aga
transfixed
crucified
in
white
fire
then
aga
was
blotted
out
by
the
dense
cloud
of
dust
that
billowed
out
over
her
and
filled
the
whole
room
with
it
came
an
intense
heat
green
opened
his
mouth
to
cry
out
to
amra
and
paxi
to
cover
their
faces
and
especially
their
noses
before
he
could
do
so
his
own
open
mouth
was
packed
with
dust
and
his
nostrils
were
full
he
began
sneezing
and
coughing
explosively
while
his
eyes
ran
tears
in
their
efforts
to
wash
out
the
dirt
that
caked
and
burned
them
clods
of
dirt
struck
him
hurled
by
the
blast
they
did
hurt
because
they
were
so
small
and
so
fluffy
but
they
fell
so
swiftly
and
in
such
numbers
that
he
was
under
them
even
in
the
midst
of
his
shock
he
could
help
being
thankful
that
he
been
breathing
out
when
the
heat
struck
him
otherwise
he
have
sucked
in
air
that
would
have
seared
his
lungs
and
he
have
dropped
dead
as
it
was
wherever
his
skin
had
not
been
covered
by
cloth
he
felt
as
if
he
were
suffering
a
bad
case
of
sunburn
painfully
he
rose
on
all
fours
and
began
crawling
toward
the
other
room
where
he
thought
the
dust
would
not
be
so
thick
at
the
same
time
he
tugged
at
amra
arm
at
least
he
supposed
it
was
her
arm
since
she
been
so
close
to
him
when
the
explosion
took
place
his
gesture
was
intended
to
tell
her
that
she
should
follow
him
she
rose
and
followed
him
touching
him
from
time
to
time
once
she
stopped
and
he
turned
to
find
out
what
was
bothering
her
even
if
he
felt
that
he
could
stand
much
more
of
the
almost
solid
dust
in
his
lungs
and
had
to
get
out
to
open
air
or
strangle
then
he
knew
that
the
woman
was
amra
for
she
was
carrying
a
child
in
her
arms
the
child
had
a
scarf
around
her
head
and
as
he
remembered
paxi
was
the
only
infant
so
dressed
coughing
violently
he
rose
to
his
feet
pulling
amra
to
hers
and
swiftly
walked
toward
where
he
hoped
the
exit
was
he
knew
he
fallen
on
his
face
in
the
general
direction
of
the
doorway
if
he
kept
in
a
straight
line
he
might
make
it
without
wandering
off
to
one
side
he
found
soon
enough
that
he
was
going
just
opposite
for
he
fell
headlong
over
a
body
on
the
floor
when
he
got
up
again
he
ran
his
hands
over
the
body
the
skin
was
crusty
scaly
aga
burned
corpse
the
cutlass
was
lying
by
her
side
assuring
him
of
her
identity
he
turned
back
still
pulling
amra
by
the
hand
this
time
he
ran
into
a
wall
but
he
had
his
free
hand
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
for
just
such
an
event
frantically
he
groped
to
his
left
until
he
came
to
the
corner
of
the
room
then
knowing
that
the
doorway
lay
back
to
his
right
he
turned
and
felt
along
the
metal
until
he
came
to
the
opening
he
plunged
through
it
almost
fell
into
the
other
room
which
was
as
dark
and
dusty
as
the
one
he
just
left
he
trotted
on
ahead
bumped
into
another
wall
groped
to
his
right
found
the
next
exit
and
ran
through
that
here
the
air
was
much
more
free
of
dust
he
could
actually
make
out
outlines
of
his
companions
as
the
light
was
penetrating
the
fainter
haze
nevertheless
he
and
the
others
were
coughing
and
weeping
as
if
they
were
trying
to
eject
lungs
and
eyeballs
alike
spasm
after
spasm
shook
them
green
decided
that
this
room
was
really
much
better
than
the
others
so
he
led
amra
and
paxi
around
the
corner
and
into
the
dark
tunnel
here
his
violent
rackings
began
to
quiet
down
and
by
rapid
blinking
which
forced
tears
he
cleaned
his
eyes
of
much
of
the
dust
anxiously
he
peered
down
the
passageway
toward
its
end
where
the
cave
mouth
formed
a
dim
arch
in
the
moonlight
outside
it
was
as
he
feared
somebody
stood
there
outlined
in
the
beams
bent
forward
peering
in
he
thought
that
it
must
be
the
priestess
for
the
figure
was
slight
and
the
hair
was
pulled
up
on
top
of
the
head
in
a
great
psyche
knot
with
a
feather
stuck
through
it
moreover
around
her
feet
were
four
or
five
cats
his
coughing
betrayed
him
for
the
priestess
suddenly
whirled
and
trotted
off
on
her
sticklike
legs
green
dropped
amra
hand
and
ran
at
the
same
time
drawing
his
stiletto
from
his
belt
as
he
lost
his
cutlass
during
the
explosion
he
had
to
stop
the
priestess
though
he
did
know
what
good
it
would
do
the
savages
sooner
or
later
would
come
to
the
sanctuary
to
ask
if
she
seen
any
of
the
refugees
and
if
they
could
find
her
they
would
at
once
suspect
what
had
happened
the
chances
were
that
they
already
knew
surely
the
noise
of
the
blast
must
have
penetrated
even
to
their
ears
or
had
it
the
air
waves
had
to
round
several
perpendicular
turns
before
reaching
the
cave
mouth
and
it
might
be
that
the
noise
had
seemed
much
greater
to
green
than
it
actually
was
because
he
been
so
close
to
it
perhaps
there
was
some
hope
he
ran
into
the
clearing
before
the
cave
mouth
the
sun
was
just
coming
over
the
horizon
so
he
could
see
things
clearly
the
old
woman
was
nowhere
in
sight
the
only
live
things
were
several
drunken
cats
one
of
these
began
to
rub
its
back
against
green
leg
and
purred
loudly
automatically
he
stooped
down
and
caressed
it
though
his
gaze
flickered
everywhere
for
a
sign
of
the
priestess
the
door
of
her
hut
was
open
and
since
it
was
so
small
he
could
be
certain
that
she
had
no
room
in
there
to
hide
from
him
she
must
have
run
off
down
the
path
if
so
she
was
making
any
noise
about
it
there
were
no
outcries
from
her
to
call
her
companions
to
her
help
he
found
her
lying
face
down
on
the
path
halfway
down
the
hill
at
first
he
thought
she
was
playing
possum
so
he
turned
her
over
his
stiletto
ready
to
shut
off
any
outcry
a
glance
at
her
hanging
jaw
and
ashen
color
convinced
him
that
her
days
were
over
at
first
he
thought
she
tripped
and
broken
her
neck
but
an
examination
disproved
this
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
was
that
her
old
heart
had
given
away
under
the
sudden
fright
and
the
stress
of
running
something
brushed
his
ankles
so
startled
was
he
so
convinced
that
a
spear
had
just
missed
him
he
leaped
into
the
air
and
whirled
around
then
he
saw
that
it
was
only
the
cat
that
had
rubbed
itself
against
him
when
he
first
come
out
of
the
tunnel
it
was
a
large
female
cat
with
a
beautiful
long
black
silky
coat
and
with
golden
eyes
it
exactly
resembled
the
earth
cat
and
was
probably
descended
from
the
same
ancestors
as
its
terrestrial
counterpart
wherever
homo
sapiens
of
the
unthinkably
long
ago
had
penetrated
he
seemed
to
have
taken
his
canine
and
feline
pets
you
like
me
huh
said
green
well
i
like
you
too
but
i
not
going
to
if
you
keep
on
scaring
me
i
been
through
enough
tonight
for
a
lifetime
the
cat
purring
paced
delicately
toward
him
maybe
you
can
do
me
some
good
he
said
and
lifted
the
cat
to
his
shoulder
where
she
crouched
vibrating
with
contentment
i
do
know
what
you
see
in
me
he
confided
softly
to
her
i
must
be
a
object
what
with
being
covered
with
dust
and
my
eyes
red
and
raw
and
running
but
then
you
not
so
delightful
yourself
what
with
your
beery
breath
blowing
in
my
face
i
like
you
very
much
what
your
name
let
call
you
lady
luck
after
all
when
i
rubbed
you
i
found
the
priestess
dead
if
she
had
died
she
have
got
away
to
warn
the
cannibals
and
obviously
you
her
luck
had
deserted
her
for
me
so
lady
luck
it
will
be
go
back
up
the
hill
and
see
what
happened
to
the
rest
of
my
friends
he
found
amra
sitting
down
at
the
cave
mouth
cuddling
paxi
in
an
effort
to
quiet
her
nine
others
were
there
too
grizquetr
soon
miran
inzax
three
women
two
little
girls
the
rest
he
presumed
were
lying
dead
or
unconscious
in
the
altar
room
they
made
a
weary
group
not
good
for
much
except
lying
down
and
passing
out
look
he
said
we
have
to
have
sleep
whatever
else
happens
go
back
into
the
first
chamber
and
get
some
there
and
as
one
the
others
protested
that
nothing
would
get
them
to
return
anywhere
near
that
horrible
room
green
was
at
a
loss
he
thought
he
knew
exactly
what
had
happened
but
he
just
could
not
explain
to
these
people
in
terms
they
understand
and
they
probably
would
have
a
dark
distrust
of
him
from
then
on
he
decided
to
take
the
simple
if
untrue
explanation
undoubtedly
aga
provoked
a
host
of
demons
by
striking
at
the
wall
behind
the
altar
he
said
i
tried
to
warn
her
you
all
heard
me
but
those
demons
wo
bother
us
again
for
we
are
now
under
the
protection
of
the
cat
the
cannibals
totem
moreover
it
is
the
nature
of
such
beings
that
once
they
released
their
fury
and
taken
some
victims
they
are
harmless
quiescent
for
a
long
time
after
it
takes
time
for
them
to
build
up
strength
enough
to
hurt
human
beings
again
they
swallowed
this
offering
as
they
would
never
have
his
other
explanation
if
you
will
lead
the
way
they
said
we
will
return
we
put
our
lives
in
your
hands
before
going
into
the
cave
he
paused
to
take
another
survey
from
his
spot
in
the
clearing
which
was
almost
on
the
top
of
the
hill
he
could
look
over
the
tree
tops
and
see
most
of
the
island
except
where
other
hills
barred
his
view
the
island
had
stopped
moving
and
had
settled
down
against
the
plain
itself
now
to
the
untutored
eye
the
entire
mass
looked
like
a
clump
of
dirt
rocks
and
vegetation
for
some
reason
rising
from
the
grassy
seas
it
would
remain
so
until
dusk
when
it
would
again
launch
itself
upon
its
journey
to
the
east
and
once
having
reached
a
certain
point
there
it
would
reverse
itself
and
begin
its
nocturnal
pilgrimage
toward
the
west
back
and
forth
shuttling
for
how
many
thousands
of
years
what
was
its
purpose
and
whom
had
its
builders
been
surely
they
could
not
have
conceived
in
their
wildest
dreams
of
its
present
use
a
mobile
fortress
for
a
tribe
of
cannibals
nor
could
they
have
seen
to
what
uses
their
would
be
put
they
could
have
guessed
that
millennia
thence
men
ignorant
of
their
originally
intended
purpose
would
be
using
the
devices
as
part
of
their
religious
ritual
and
of
human
sacrifice
green
left
the
others
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
where
the
explosion
had
taken
place
they
lay
down
on
the
hard
floor
and
at
once
went
to
sleep
he
however
felt
that
there
were
certain
things
that
had
to
be
done
and
that
he
was
the
only
one
physically
capable
of
doing
them
though
he
hated
to
go
back
into
the
altar
room
he
forced
himself
the
scene
of
carnage
was
bad
enough
but
not
as
repulsive
as
he
expected
dust
had
thrown
a
gray
veil
of
mercy
over
the
bodies
they
looked
like
peaceful
gray
statues
most
of
them
had
not
burned
on
the
outside
but
had
died
because
they
breathed
the
first
wave
of
air
directly
nevertheless
despite
the
look
of
peace
and
antiquity
the
odor
of
burned
flesh
from
aga
hung
heavy
lady
luck
bristled
and
arched
her
back
and
for
a
moment
green
thought
she
was
going
to
leap
from
his
shoulder
and
run
away
he
said
take
it
easy
then
decided
that
she
must
have
smelled
this
often
before
her
present
reaction
was
based
on
past
episodes
probably
there
had
been
great
excitement
then
the
cats
being
taboo
animals
must
have
been
figures
of
some
importance
in
the
sacrificial
ceremonies
cautiously
the
man
approached
the
wall
of
dirt
behind
the
altar
even
though
he
did
not
think
there
would
be
any
danger
for
some
time
to
come
the
altar
itself
was
comparatively
undamaged
surprised
at
this
he
ran
his
hand
over
it
and
found
out
that
it
was
composed
of
baked
clay
hard
as
rock
the
chair
and
metal
rod
had
not
been
torn
loose
both
were
tightly
bolted
down
with
huge
studs
which
he
supposed
had
been
taken
off
wrecked
the
victims
that
were
tied
in
the
chair
by
the
savages
must
have
been
sitting
looking
at
the
audience
so
that
their
backs
were
to
the
wall
itself
that
meant
that
when
the
rod
was
dropped
to
make
contact
between
the
wall
and
victim
the
discharge
only
burned
the
head
evidence
of
that
was
the
fact
that
only
skulls
were
stacked
around
the
altar
the
charred
head
was
severed
and
the
body
carted
outside
to
one
destination
or
another
what
puzzled
green
was
how
the
audience
managed
to
escape
the
fury
of
the
blast
and
of
the
dust
even
if
they
stood
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
big
room
determined
to
find
out
what
happened
at
those
times
he
returned
to
the
doorway
just
around
its
corner
in
the
second
room
he
discovered
what
he
not
noticed
before
probably
because
it
was
placed
so
upright
and
so
firmly
against
one
side
of
the
wall
and
because
its
back
which
was
turned
away
from
the
wall
was
also
made
of
gray
metal
when
he
switched
it
around
so
he
could
see
its
other
side
he
was
staring
into
a
mirror
about
six
feet
high
and
four
feet
wide
now
he
could
visualize
the
ceremony
the
victim
was
strapped
into
the
chair
and
a
rope
was
tied
around
the
rod
everybody
but
the
priestess
or
whoever
conducted
the
rites
retreated
from
the
altar
room
the
conductor
himself
or
herself
then
stood
in
the
doorway
and
released
the
cord
before
the
rod
could
make
contact
the
conductor
had
stepped
around
the
corner
and
there
the
audience
saw
in
the
mirror
placed
in
the
doorway
so
it
reflected
the
interior
of
the
altar
room
the
ravening
discharge
of
a
tremendous
electrostatic
blast
and
immediately
afterward
no
doubt
they
saw
nothing
because
of
the
dust
that
would
fill
the
two
rooms
strange
and
strong
magic
to
the
savages
what
myths
they
must
have
built
about
this
room
what
tales
of
horrible
and
powerful
gods
or
demons
imprisoned
in
that
wall
of
dirt
surely
their
old
women
must
whisper
to
the
children
stories
of
how
the
great
had
been
caught
by
their
legendary
strong
man
and
savior
some
analog
to
hercules
or
gilgamesh
or
thor
and
how
the
was
the
tribe
to
keep
prisoner
with
their
magic
and
to
appease
from
time
to
time
with
human
kills
from
other
tribes
lest
it
become
so
angry
it
burst
through
the
wall
of
earth
and
devour
everybody
upon
the
floating
island
green
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
dig
through
that
wall
even
if
it
would
be
safe
for
days
it
might
only
be
several
feet
thick
or
it
might
be
twenty
or
more
but
however
thick
it
was
he
bet
that
anybody
who
had
the
tools
time
and
strength
to
excavate
would
find
embedded
somewhere
in
that
mass
several
large
he
did
know
what
shape
they
take
because
that
would
depend
on
the
culture
that
had
built
them
and
their
tastes
in
decorations
would
differ
from
green
society
but
if
they
had
architectural
ideas
similar
to
terrans
they
would
have
constructed
the
collectors
in
the
shape
of
busts
or
of
animals
heads
or
even
of
bookcases
with
false
backs
of
books
filling
them
books
that
would
in
reality
have
been
both
chargers
and
filters
the
busts
or
books
would
have
been
pierced
with
many
tiny
holes
and
through
these
holes
the
charged
particles
of
dust
would
have
drifted
once
inside
the
collectors
they
would
have
been
burned
looking
at
the
blank
dirt
before
him
green
could
see
what
had
happened
through
the
ages
some
part
of
the
burning
mechanism
had
gone
wrong
as
was
the
custom
of
mechanisms
everywhere
but
the
charging
effect
had
continued
and
though
the
dust
had
piled
up
around
the
collectors
the
extraordinarily
powerful
fields
had
continued
to
work
even
through
the
thick
blanket
in
the
beginning
of
course
their
field
could
not
have
caused
any
human
being
harm
but
these
batteries
must
have
been
built
to
adjust
to
whatever
demand
was
made
of
them
though
their
builders
of
course
could
have
had
no
idea
of
how
great
that
demand
would
some
day
be
nevertheless
it
had
come
and
the
batteries
had
been
equal
to
it
by
the
time
the
savages
had
found
this
room
they
were
blocked
off
by
this
imposing
wall
through
the
death
of
their
fellows
they
had
discovered
that
touching
the
wall
caused
a
terrible
discharge
of
electrostatic
electricity
the
rest
of
the
apparatus
for
execution
and
the
ritual
that
went
with
it
was
foregone
and
logical
religiously
speaking
green
swore
with
frustration
how
he
would
love
to
get
through
that
dirt
before
another
charge
built
up
on
the
other
side
must
be
another
doorway
and
it
must
lead
to
the
fuel
and
control
rooms
for
this
whole
island
if
he
could
get
inside
and
there
figure
out
the
controls
turn
this
island
upside
down
and
shake
off
the
monsters
there
be
no
holding
him
then
he
remembered
the
story
of
samdroo
the
tailor
who
turned
sailor
the
legend
went
that
samdroo
his
wrecked
upon
just
such
a
roaming
island
as
this
one
had
wandered
into
just
such
a
cave
and
through
rooms
like
these
but
he
found
no
barrier
of
electrically
charged
dirt
and
had
walked
into
a
room
which
contained
many
strange
things
one
of
them
was
a
great
eye
that
allowed
samdroo
to
see
in
it
what
was
happening
outside
the
cave
another
was
a
board
which
contained
many
round
faces
over
which
raced
little
squiggles
and
lines
of
course
the
story
had
its
own
explanations
for
what
these
things
were
but
green
could
hardly
fail
to
recognize
tv
oscilloscopes
and
other
instruments
unfortunately
his
knowledge
was
going
to
do
him
no
good
he
going
to
get
through
the
dirt
nor
was
he
to
be
allowed
time
for
excavation
and
exploration
every
minute
on
this
island
meant
that
he
was
traveling
back
to
quotz
and
its
revengeful
duchess
and
getting
farther
from
estorya
where
the
two
spacemen
and
their
ship
were
he
had
to
find
a
way
of
getting
off
this
place
and
onto
some
means
of
transportation
he
left
the
death
chamber
and
went
into
the
next
room
after
slumping
down
against
the
wall
between
amra
with
paxi
in
her
arms
and
inzax
with
grizquetr
in
hers
he
chewed
some
dried
meat
lady
luck
meowed
for
some
and
he
gladly
gave
her
all
she
wanted
when
he
swallowed
all
he
could
hold
without
bursting
and
had
washed
that
down
with
great
drafts
of
the
warm
and
sweet
beer
taken
from
the
priestess
hut
he
closed
his
eyes
now
it
was
up
to
his
vigilante
to
take
the
food
and
rebuild
his
wasted
tissue
throw
off
the
effects
of
autointoxication
tone
his
tired
muscles
relax
his
nerves
readjust
his
hormonal
balance
green
dreamed
that
his
mouth
and
nose
were
clogged
with
dirt
and
that
he
was
suffocating
he
woke
to
find
that
while
there
was
no
earth
upon
him
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
getting
his
breath
remedying
that
by
removing
the
cat
from
his
face
he
rose
what
do
you
want
he
asked
her
she
was
mewing
and
striking
gently
at
him
she
padded
toward
the
doorway
to
the
outside
so
he
imagined
that
she
wished
him
to
follow
her
grasping
his
cutlass
he
walked
after
her
and
out
to
the
tunnel
that
led
to
the
cave
mouth
not
until
then
did
he
hear
the
booming
of
cannon
far
away
the
cat
meowed
plaintively
evidently
she
heard
cannonfire
before
and
had
not
liked
the
results
once
out
of
the
cave
he
stopped
to
look
up
at
the
sun
it
was
on
its
downward
path
from
the
zenith
about
four
in
the
afternoon
he
slept
about
ten
hours
unable
to
see
much
from
where
he
stood
he
climbed
up
the
rocks
outside
the
cave
and
soon
stood
upon
the
very
top
of
the
hill
a
little
tableland
about
ten
feet
square
from
there
he
commanded
as
good
a
view
of
the
island
as
anyone
could
get
tacking
around
the
periphery
of
the
island
were
three
long
low
with
wheels
and
scarlet
sails
occasionally
a
lance
of
red
spurted
from
one
of
the
vessel
ports
a
boom
reached
green
ears
a
few
seconds
later
and
he
would
see
the
iron
ball
climb
up
and
up
then
fall
toward
the
village
a
tree
around
the
clearing
would
lose
a
limb
or
a
spurt
of
dust
would
show
where
a
ball
landed
in
the
clearing
itself
two
of
the
long
houses
had
big
holes
in
their
roofs
the
village
itself
was
deserted
as
no
one
with
good
sense
would
have
remained
there
none
of
the
cannibals
were
visible
but
that
was
surprising
considering
how
thick
the
woods
were
green
hoped
the
vings
would
land
soon
and
clean
out
the
savages
that
would
leave
him
and
his
party
a
clear
field
unless
the
pirates
investigated
the
cave
in
the
same
day
if
they
did
then
the
refugees
could
leave
the
island
and
take
to
the
plains
under
cover
of
the
night
anxiously
green
traced
the
path
that
led
from
the
hilltop
where
he
stood
and
wound
down
to
the
village
it
was
a
narrow
trail
and
he
often
lost
sight
of
it
but
always
there
was
a
difference
in
the
shading
of
the
tree
tops
along
the
trail
and
the
rest
of
the
forest
with
his
eye
he
could
follow
the
shading
to
the
village
and
beyond
toward
the
back
or
western
part
of
the
island
it
was
here
that
he
came
across
the
first
sign
of
hope
he
had
had
since
the
wreck
of
the
of
it
was
a
small
break
in
the
vegetation
which
ran
uninterrupted
to
the
very
edge
of
the
island
a
shelf
of
seemingly
smooth
earth
almost
hidden
from
him
by
the
slope
of
the
terrain
indeed
he
could
barely
make
it
out
and
might
have
missed
it
altogether
but
he
saw
the
masts
of
three
small
projecting
from
above
the
slope
and
followed
them
down
toward
the
hulls
all
three
were
yachts
obviously
not
of
islander
make
beyond
the
stolen
craft
were
the
uprights
of
davits
these
were
behind
a
wall
of
branches
camouflage
for
anybody
outside
the
island
but
visible
to
those
on
the
inside
it
was
all
green
could
do
to
keep
from
whooping
with
joy
now
he
and
his
party
would
have
to
cast
themselves
on
foot
on
the
dangerous
plains
they
could
sail
in
comparative
safety
now
while
the
cannibals
were
cowering
helplessly
under
the
bombardment
green
could
lead
his
people
through
the
woods
to
the
yachts
when
dusk
came
and
the
island
began
moving
again
they
could
lower
a
yacht
from
the
davits
and
set
sail
he
went
back
to
the
cave
entrance
where
he
found
everybody
awake
waiting
for
him
he
told
them
what
he
seen
and
added
if
the
vings
come
aboard
take
advantage
of
the
confusion
and
escape
miran
looked
at
the
sun
and
shook
his
head
the
vings
wo
attack
now
it
too
close
to
dusk
they
want
a
full
day
for
fighting
they
follow
the
island
tonight
when
dawn
comes
and
the
island
stops
they
board
i
bow
to
your
superior
experience
green
said
only
i
like
to
ask
you
one
thing
why
do
the
vings
launch
their
small
craft
at
night
and
land
boarding
parties
from
them
miran
looked
surprised
no
one
does
that
it
unthinkable
do
you
know
that
at
night
the
plains
abound
in
spirits
and
demons
the
vings
would
think
of
taking
a
chance
on
what
the
magic
of
the
savages
might
unloose
against
them
in
the
darkness
i
knew
of
the
general
attitude
but
it
had
slipped
my
mind
admitted
green
but
if
this
is
so
why
did
you
all
wander
about
this
place
the
night
the
was
wrecked
that
was
a
situation
where
we
preferred
the
somewhat
uncertain
possibility
of
stumbling
across
demons
to
the
certainty
of
being
killed
by
the
cannibals
said
miran
to
be
honest
said
amra
i
was
too
scared
to
think
of
ghosts
if
i
had
i
might
have
stayed
where
i
was
no
i
would
either
never
seen
a
ghost
but
i
had
seen
those
savages
well
said
green
all
of
you
might
as
well
make
up
your
mind
that
come
ghosts
demons
or
men
we
walking
through
the
dark
tonight
all
those
too
scared
will
have
to
stay
behind
he
began
issuing
orders
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
the
bedraggled
and
party
ready
after
that
he
turned
to
watch
the
bombardment
by
then
it
had
largely
ceased
only
occasionally
did
one
of
the
vessels
loose
a
single
cannon
shot
the
rest
of
the
time
they
spent
in
tacking
back
and
forth
and
in
running
up
close
to
the
very
edge
of
the
island
i
think
they
are
trying
the
temper
of
the
island
inhabitants
green
said
they
do
know
whether
the
woods
conceal
a
hundred
savages
or
a
thousand
or
whether
they
armed
with
cannons
and
muskets
or
just
with
spears
they
want
to
draw
fire
so
they
can
get
an
estimate
of
what
they
facing
he
turned
to
miran
which
reminds
me
why
is
it
that
the
natives
use
guns
they
must
have
a
chance
to
get
their
hands
on
many
from
the
wrecks
the
fat
merchant
shrugged
and
rolled
his
one
good
eye
to
indicate
that
he
did
really
know
but
was
making
a
guess
probably
they
a
taboo
against
using
firearms
whatever
the
reason
they
evidently
suffering
because
they
neglect
them
look
how
few
they
are
only
fifty
men
they
must
have
lost
quite
a
few
through
raids
from
other
savage
tribes
both
from
those
who
live
upon
the
plain
itself
and
from
those
who
live
on
other
roaming
islands
down
to
the
point
now
where
they
must
die
out
within
a
generation
even
without
help
from
such
as
those
he
said
pointing
to
the
ving
yes
and
i
suppose
that
during
the
daytime
when
the
island
is
stopped
grass
cats
and
dire
dogs
board
it
these
must
take
their
toll
of
the
humans
he
gazed
again
at
the
red
sails
and
wheels
of
the
vings
i
think
that
those
pirates
would
take
every
island
they
could
and
would
use
them
as
bases
from
which
to
operate
they
do
said
amra
for
a
generation
now
the
vings
have
been
scouring
the
plains
locating
the
islands
and
exterminating
the
savages
on
them
then
they
fortified
the
islands
so
that
you
might
say
that
today
the
xurdimur
is
dominated
by
them
but
there
a
drawback
to
an
island
as
a
harbor
no
large
may
get
very
close
except
in
the
daylight
they
have
to
put
out
to
grass
every
night
and
follow
their
base
at
a
safe
distance
until
dawn
however
though
the
vings
are
well
established
on
many
roamers
they
often
attacked
by
the
navies
of
various
nations
and
sometimes
driven
off
then
the
nation
that
takes
possession
of
the
island
has
a
nice
little
base
and
of
course
quite
often
they
use
it
to
launch
their
own
piratical
ventures
against
the
craft
of
countries
at
peace
with
them
oh
the
xurdimur
is
a
land
where
every
man
hand
is
against
the
other
and
the
devil
take
the
ones
with
short
sail
a
man
may
make
his
fortune
or
break
his
heart
all
in
a
night
work
but
then
you
know
that
only
too
well
green
interrupted
we
leave
them
and
the
natives
too
when
moonlight
gets
here
i
only
hope
that
there
are
other
ving
craft
in
the
neighborhood
what
the
gods
will
happens
replied
miran
his
sad
face
reflected
the
belief
that
if
he
the
favorite
of
mennirox
could
come
to
grief
then
green
could
expect
even
worse
when
dusk
came
green
walked
from
the
cave
into
the
dark
and
hard
rain
behind
him
came
amra
one
hand
upon
his
shoulder
the
other
supporting
paxi
the
rest
were
stretched
out
in
a
line
behind
her
each
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
one
ahead
the
black
cat
was
underneath
green
coat
riding
in
a
large
pocket
of
his
shirt
she
had
made
it
plain
to
him
that
where
he
went
she
went
and
green
to
avoid
a
big
fuss
and
also
because
he
was
beginning
to
feel
very
affectionate
toward
her
allowed
her
to
come
along
the
descent
from
the
hilltop
was
an
anxious
and
stumbling
trip
green
after
ten
minutes
of
groping
along
the
path
had
to
acknowledge
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
so
many
windings
had
the
path
taken
that
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
going
east
north
south
or
in
the
right
direction
west
actually
it
did
really
matter
as
long
as
it
brought
him
to
the
edge
of
the
island
he
could
skirt
the
edge
until
he
arrived
at
the
fleet
craft
that
would
give
them
a
chance
for
flight
the
trouble
was
in
finding
that
rim
he
was
afraid
that
it
would
be
possible
to
wander
in
circles
and
figure
eights
until
moonlight
then
though
they
be
able
to
orient
themselves
they
also
be
exposed
to
the
view
of
the
cannibals
and
if
they
found
themselves
say
at
the
eastern
edge
their
journey
around
would
be
perilous
indeed
occasional
lightning
flashed
and
then
he
could
make
out
his
immediate
environment
these
brief
revelations
were
much
help
all
he
could
see
were
the
walls
of
tree
trunks
and
bushes
suddenly
amra
spoke
do
you
think
we
getting
close
he
stopped
so
suddenly
that
the
entire
line
lurched
into
him
lightning
burst
again
quite
close
by
the
cat
curled
in
his
coat
pocket
spat
and
tried
to
shrink
into
an
even
smaller
ball
absently
green
patted
her
from
outside
the
coat
he
said
your
name
lady
luck
i
just
saw
the
village
now
we
getting
some
place
i
really
needed
that
referent
he
was
worried
about
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
all
were
undoubtedly
cowering
under
the
roofs
of
their
long
houses
praying
to
whatever
gods
they
worshiped
that
they
would
not
send
the
lightning
their
way
there
would
be
little
danger
if
the
whole
party
were
to
walk
through
the
center
of
the
village
he
planned
to
take
no
chances
at
all
however
and
ordered
everybody
to
follow
him
around
the
clearing
it
wo
be
long
now
he
said
to
amra
pass
the
word
back
and
cheer
everybody
up
half
an
hour
later
he
wished
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
it
was
true
that
he
followed
the
wandering
path
to
the
cove
where
their
boats
were
kept
but
he
at
once
drawn
his
breath
in
pain
of
surprise
a
lightning
bolt
had
illuminated
the
gray
rock
walls
of
the
cove
its
broad
shelf
and
the
high
black
iron
davits
but
the
yachts
were
gone
later
green
thought
that
if
ever
the
time
came
when
he
should
have
cracked
up
that
instant
of
loss
white
and
sudden
as
the
lightning
itself
should
have
been
the
one
the
others
cried
out
loudly
in
their
grief
and
shock
but
he
was
as
silent
as
the
empty
stone
shelf
he
could
not
move
nor
utter
a
word
all
seemed
hopeless
so
what
was
the
use
of
motion
or
talk
nevertheless
he
was
human
and
human
beings
hope
even
when
there
is
no
justification
for
it
nor
could
he
remain
frozen
until
the
next
stroke
of
lightning
would
reveal
to
the
others
the
state
of
their
leader
he
to
act
what
if
his
actions
meaningless
mere
movement
answered
for
the
demands
of
the
body
and
at
that
moment
it
was
his
body
that
could
move
his
mind
was
congealed
shouting
to
the
others
to
scatter
and
look
about
in
the
brush
but
not
to
scatter
too
far
he
began
climbing
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
when
he
had
reached
its
top
he
left
the
path
and
plunged
into
the
forest
to
his
right
on
the
theory
that
if
the
yachts
were
anywhere
they
must
be
there
he
had
two
ideas
about
where
they
might
be
one
was
that
the
vings
had
spotted
them
and
had
sent
in
a
party
aboard
a
gig
to
push
them
over
the
side
of
the
island
thus
when
the
island
had
begun
its
nightly
voyage
it
had
left
the
sitting
upon
the
plain
the
other
theory
was
also
inspired
by
the
presence
of
the
vings
perhaps
the
savages
had
hidden
their
craft
because
of
just
such
an
event
as
his
first
theory
put
forth
to
do
that
they
would
have
had
to
haul
the
up
the
less
steep
slant
of
the
cove
at
the
point
where
he
would
have
looped
a
rope
around
a
tree
and
used
it
to
pull
a
yacht
uphill
he
saw
all
three
of
the
missing
craft
they
were
nestling
side
by
side
just
over
the
lip
of
the
slope
their
hulls
hidden
by
brush
piled
up
before
them
their
tall
masts
of
course
would
be
taken
for
tree
trunks
by
anybody
but
a
very
close
observer
green
yelled
with
joy
then
whirled
to
run
back
and
tell
the
others
and
slammed
into
a
tree
trunk
he
picked
himself
up
swearing
because
he
hurt
his
nose
and
tripped
over
something
and
fell
again
thereafter
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
of
frustration
of
conspiracy
between
tree
and
night
to
catch
and
delay
him
where
his
trip
up
had
been
easy
his
trip
back
was
a
continued
barking
of
shins
bumping
of
nose
and
tearing
loose
from
clutching
bushes
and
thorns
his
confusion
was
at
all
helped
when
the
lightning
ceased
because
he
been
guiding
himself
by
its
frequent
flashes
and
lady
luck
alarmed
at
all
the
hard
knocks
she
was
getting
struggled
out
of
his
shirt
pocket
and
slipped
into
the
forest
he
called
to
her
to
come
back
but
she
had
had
enough
of
him
for
the
time
being
anyway
for
a
brief
moment
he
thought
of
the
fantastic
device
of
grabbing
hold
of
her
tail
and
following
her
through
the
dark
but
she
was
gone
and
the
idea
would
have
worked
anyway
more
than
likely
she
have
turned
and
bitten
his
hands
until
he
released
her
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
make
his
own
way
back
after
ten
minutes
of
frantic
struggling
during
which
he
suddenly
realized
he
turned
the
wrong
way
and
was
wandering
away
from
the
edge
of
the
island
he
saw
the
clouds
disappear
with
the
bright
moon
came
vision
and
sanity
he
turned
around
and
in
a
short
time
was
back
at
the
cove
what
happened
to
you
asked
amra
we
thought
maybe
you
fallen
off
the
edge
that
about
all
that
did
happen
he
said
irritated
now
that
he
had
been
so
easily
lost
he
told
them
where
the
yachts
were
and
added
we
have
to
let
one
down
by
a
rope
before
we
can
connect
it
to
the
davits
it
take
a
lot
of
pushing
and
pulling
a
lot
of
muscle
everybody
up
on
the
hill
including
the
children
wearily
they
climbed
up
the
slope
to
the
top
and
shoved
one
of
the
up
the
slight
incline
of
the
depression
to
the
lip
of
the
hill
green
picked
up
one
of
the
wet
ropes
lying
on
the
ground
and
passed
it
around
the
tree
its
trunk
had
a
groove
where
many
ropes
had
worn
a
path
during
similar
operations
one
end
he
gave
to
half
of
the
party
putting
miran
in
charge
of
them
the
other
end
he
tied
in
a
bowknot
to
a
huge
iron
eye
which
projected
from
the
stern
of
the
craft
then
ordering
the
other
half
of
the
women
to
help
him
push
he
got
the
over
the
lip
and
down
the
slope
while
the
rope
gang
slowly
released
the
double
loop
around
the
tree
in
short
jerks
when
the
craft
had
halted
by
the
davits
green
untied
the
rope
his
next
step
would
be
to
back
the
yacht
in
between
the
davits
so
that
he
could
hook
up
its
ropes
and
lift
it
fortunately
there
was
a
winch
and
cable
for
this
unfortunately
the
winch
was
and
had
been
allowed
to
get
rusty
it
would
work
only
with
great
resistance
and
with
loud
squeaking
not
that
more
noise
mattered
for
the
party
had
made
so
much
that
only
the
fact
that
the
wind
was
from
the
east
could
have
kept
the
savages
in
ignorance
of
the
survivors
whereabouts
it
was
as
if
his
thinking
of
them
had
brought
them
upon
the
scene
grizquetr
who
been
stationed
in
a
tree
as
a
sentinel
called
down
i
see
a
torch
it
somewhere
in
the
woods
about
half
a
mile
away
oh
there
another
one
and
another
one
green
said
do
you
think
they
on
the
path
that
leads
here
i
do
know
but
they
coming
this
way
winding
here
and
there
wandering
like
samdroo
when
he
was
lost
in
the
mirrored
mazes
of
the
black
one
yes
they
must
be
on
the
path
green
began
feverishly
tying
the
to
the
axles
of
the
craft
he
sweated
with
anxiety
and
cursed
when
his
fumbling
fingers
got
in
the
way
of
his
haste
but
the
tying
of
the
four
bowknots
actually
took
less
than
a
minute
in
spite
of
the
way
time
seemed
to
race
past
him
that
done
he
had
to
order
off
the
yacht
some
of
the
women
who
had
climbed
aboard
only
the
women
who
had
to
take
care
of
very
small
infants
and
the
older
children
were
to
be
on
that
boat
just
who
do
you
think
is
going
to
work
the
winch
he
barked
at
the
now
jump
to
it
one
of
the
women
on
the
wailed
are
you
going
to
stay
on
the
island
and
leave
us
all
alone
on
this
in
the
midst
of
the
xurdimur
no
he
answered
as
calmly
as
possible
we
going
to
lower
you
to
the
ground
then
we
going
back
up
the
hill
and
shove
the
other
over
the
edge
so
that
they
ca
be
used
by
the
savages
to
come
after
us
we
jump
off
and
walk
back
to
you
seeing
that
the
women
were
still
not
convinced
and
softened
by
their
pitiable
looks
he
called
to
grizquetr
come
down
and
get
on
the
boat
and
when
the
boy
had
run
down
the
slope
and
halted
by
his
side
breathing
hard
and
looking
up
at
him
for
his
orders
green
said
delegating
you
to
guard
these
women
and
babies
until
we
arrive
okay
okay
said
grizquetr
grinning
his
chest
swelling
because
of
the
importance
of
the
duty
i
captain
until
you
climb
aboard
is
that
it
you
a
captain
and
a
good
one
too
said
green
slapping
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
then
he
ordered
the
winches
turned
until
the
was
hoisted
into
the
air
a
few
inches
as
soon
as
the
rusty
machines
had
groaningly
fulfilled
their
functions
he
had
the
craft
lowered
over
the
edge
and
down
to
the
plain
the
transition
was
smoothly
made
the
yacht
wheels
began
turning
the
nose
lifted
only
slightly
because
of
the
superior
pull
on
the
ropes
tied
to
the
bow
the
stem
ropes
were
paid
out
a
little
to
equalize
the
strain
then
obeying
gesture
the
women
aboard
it
pulled
at
the
bowknots
which
untied
simultaneously
not
until
then
did
he
breathe
a
little
easier
for
if
one
or
more
had
refused
to
slip
loose
as
swiftly
as
another
the
craft
might
have
been
pulled
up
on
one
side
or
dragged
around
by
either
end
and
thus
capsized
for
a
few
seconds
he
watched
the
slip
away
coasting
on
its
momentum
but
headed
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
of
the
island
then
it
had
stopped
and
it
began
to
grow
smaller
as
the
island
left
it
behind
from
it
came
the
thin
wailing
of
his
daughter
paxi
it
broke
the
spell
that
momentarily
held
him
he
began
running
up
the
slope
shouting
follow
me
reaching
the
crest
of
the
hill
ahead
of
the
others
he
took
time
for
a
glance
through
the
woods
sure
enough
torches
bobbed
up
and
down
and
flickered
in
and
out
as
they
passed
between
tree
trunks
and
there
were
drums
beating
somewhere
on
the
island
lady
luck
shot
out
of
the
woods
leaped
upon
green
knee
scaled
his
shirt
front
and
came
to
rest
upon
his
shoulder
ah
you
wandering
wench
you
he
said
i
knew
you
could
stay
away
from
my
irresistible
charm
now
could
you
lady
luck
did
reply
but
gazed
anxiously
at
the
forest
never
fear
my
pretty
little
one
he
said
they
not
touch
a
hair
of
my
fine
blond
head
nor
a
silky
black
one
of
yours
by
then
the
others
puffing
and
panting
had
gained
the
top
of
the
hill
he
set
them
to
pushing
on
the
stern
of
a
yacht
and
in
a
minute
they
had
sent
it
headlong
down
the
hill
when
it
rushed
over
the
edge
and
disappeared
with
a
crash
on
the
plain
below
they
had
all
they
could
do
to
restrain
their
cheers
small
revenge
for
the
suffering
had
to
undergo
but
it
was
something
now
for
the
other
said
green
then
everybody
run
as
if
the
demons
of
were
on
your
tails
grunting
they
pushed
the
last
up
the
little
incline
then
gathered
their
strength
for
the
final
heave
that
would
launch
it
too
upon
its
last
voyage
and
at
that
moment
some
savages
who
been
running
ahead
of
the
burst
out
of
the
woods
green
took
one
look
and
realized
that
they
would
get
between
the
edge
of
the
island
and
his
party
there
were
about
ten
of
them
they
not
only
outnumbered
his
own
force
but
were
strong
men
against
women
and
they
had
spears
whereas
his
people
were
armed
mainly
with
cutlasses
green
did
waste
any
time
in
meditation
everybody
aboard
except
miran
and
me
he
said
loudly
do
argue
get
in
we
riding
through
them
lie
flat
on
the
deck
screaming
the
women
scrambled
over
the
low
rail
and
onto
the
deck
as
soon
as
the
last
one
was
on
the
earthman
and
miran
put
their
shoulders
to
the
stern
and
pushed
for
a
second
it
looked
as
though
their
combined
strength
would
not
be
enough
as
if
the
party
should
have
shoved
the
craft
a
little
further
over
the
lip
of
the
hill
before
stopping
there
not
time
to
get
them
out
again
to
help
us
panted
green
dig
in
miran
get
that
fat
into
gear
shove
damn
you
shove
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
breaking
his
own
collarbone
under
the
pressure
and
that
he
never
felt
such
hard
and
cutting
wood
in
all
his
life
and
it
seemed
that
the
was
stubbornly
refusing
to
move
until
the
cannibals
arrived
in
time
to
save
it
like
the
marines
his
legs
quivered
and
his
intestines
he
was
sure
were
writhing
about
like
snakes
striking
here
and
there
against
the
wall
of
his
belly
seeking
a
weak
place
where
they
might
erupt
through
into
the
open
air
and
leave
this
man
who
subjected
them
to
such
toil
there
was
a
shout
from
the
warriors
assembled
below
and
a
thud
of
their
feet
as
they
charged
up
now
or
never
shouted
green
his
face
felt
like
one
big
blood
vessel
and
he
was
sure
that
he
was
going
to
blow
his
top
literally
but
the
moved
forward
crept
slowly
groaned
or
was
that
he
and
began
moving
swiftly
too
swiftly
down
the
slope
too
swiftly
because
he
had
to
run
after
it
grab
the
taffrail
and
haul
himself
over
and
while
he
was
doing
that
he
had
to
extend
a
hand
to
miran
who
was
as
fast
on
his
feet
fortunately
amra
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
grab
miran
by
the
shoulder
of
his
shirt
and
help
pull
over
the
rail
he
came
crying
out
in
pain
as
his
big
stomach
burned
against
the
hard
mahogany
but
not
forgetting
the
bag
of
jewels
clutched
in
his
hand
lady
luck
had
already
deserted
her
post
on
green
shoulder
when
he
began
pushing
now
she
meowed
softly
and
pressed
against
him
scared
at
the
shaking
of
the
deck
and
the
rumbling
of
the
wheels
as
the
craft
sped
downhill
he
pulled
her
to
him
in
the
protection
of
the
crook
of
his
arm
and
reared
up
on
his
elbow
to
see
what
he
could
see
what
he
saw
was
a
spear
flying
straight
at
him
it
shot
by
so
close
he
fancied
he
could
feel
the
sharp
edge
of
its
blade
graze
him
and
there
was
nothing
of
his
imagination
about
the
woman
scream
that
rose
immediately
afterward
it
sounded
so
much
like
amra
that
he
was
sure
she
been
hit
however
he
had
no
time
to
turn
and
find
out
an
islander
had
appeared
by
the
side
of
the
yacht
and
as
the
deck
was
on
a
level
with
his
chest
the
fellow
could
see
them
all
easily
enough
his
arm
flew
back
then
leaped
forward
and
the
spear
he
held
darted
straight
at
green
no
not
at
him
but
at
lady
luck
another
warrior
a
little
further
down
the
slope
screaming
something
also
thrust
at
the
cat
evidently
felines
were
no
longer
taboo
upon
this
island
the
former
worshipers
considered
that
their
totem
had
deserted
them
and
therefore
deserved
death
lady
luck
however
had
the
traditional
nine
lives
none
of
the
razor
sharp
blades
came
very
close
to
her
and
in
the
next
few
seconds
the
savages
were
left
howling
upon
the
slope
or
lying
unconscious
on
the
spot
where
the
had
struck
them
the
vessel
sped
down
the
steep
incline
bumped
hard
as
it
roared
out
upon
the
stone
shelf
and
flew
into
the
air
green
flattened
himself
out
against
the
deck
hoping
thus
to
dampen
the
effect
of
the
drop
onto
the
plain
somehow
he
became
separated
from
the
deck
was
floating
in
the
air
and
saw
the
planks
rushing
up
at
him
there
was
a
brief
interlude
of
darkness
before
green
awoke
and
realized
that
the
meeting
of
the
deck
and
his
face
had
done
the
latter
no
good
at
all
and
might
have
resulted
in
considerable
damage
he
was
sure
of
it
when
he
spit
out
his
two
front
teeth
however
his
pain
was
overwhelmed
in
the
rush
of
joy
at
having
escaped
for
the
island
was
retreating
across
the
flat
moonlit
xurdimur
while
its
inhabitants
screamed
and
jumped
with
fury
and
frustration
on
the
rim
unable
to
bring
themselves
to
leap
after
the
refugees
home
was
where
the
island
was
and
they
were
going
to
get
left
behind
for
the
sake
of
revenge
i
hope
the
vings
exterminate
you
tomorrow
muttered
green
wearily
and
painfully
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
surveyed
what
was
left
of
the
clan
effenycan
amra
was
unhurt
if
it
was
she
who
screamed
when
the
spear
had
passed
over
green
she
done
it
from
fright
the
spear
itself
was
sticking
out
from
the
base
of
the
mast
its
head
in
the
wood
he
climbed
over
the
side
and
inspected
the
damage
done
by
the
drop
one
of
the
wheels
had
fallen
off
and
an
axle
was
bent
shaking
his
head
he
spoke
to
the
others
this
roller
is
done
for
let
start
walking
we
a
boat
to
catch
two
weeks
later
the
yacht
was
scudding
along
under
a
wind
it
was
high
noon
and
everybody
except
the
helmsmen
amra
and
miran
was
eating
they
were
lunching
on
steaks
carved
from
a
which
green
had
shot
from
the
deck
and
which
had
been
cooked
on
the
fireplace
placed
under
a
hood
immediately
aft
of
the
small
foredeck
there
was
no
lack
of
food
despite
the
fact
that
the
yacht
had
not
been
stocked
fortunately
the
savages
who
owned
it
had
not
bothered
to
remove
the
several
pistols
and
the
keg
of
powder
and
sack
of
balls
from
its
locker
with
this
green
killed
enough
deer
and
to
keep
everybody
well
fed
amra
supplemented
their
protein
diet
with
grass
which
her
culinary
art
turned
into
a
halfway
decent
salad
at
times
when
they
neared
a
grove
of
trees
green
would
stop
the
yacht
they
would
go
foraging
for
berries
and
for
a
large
plant
which
could
be
beaten
until
soft
mixed
with
water
kneaded
and
baked
into
a
kind
of
bread
once
a
grass
cat
dashed
out
from
behind
a
tree
making
straight
for
inzax
green
and
miran
both
firing
at
the
same
time
crumpled
it
within
ten
yards
of
the
little
blonde
the
grass
cats
big
creatures
with
long
slim
legs
built
for
running
were
only
a
peril
when
the
party
left
the
yacht
though
fully
capable
of
leaping
aboard
when
the
was
in
movement
they
never
did
sometimes
they
might
pace
it
for
a
mile
or
so
then
they
would
contemptuously
walk
away
green
wished
he
could
say
the
same
for
the
dire
dogs
these
were
almost
as
large
as
the
grass
cats
and
ran
in
packs
of
from
six
to
twelve
with
their
spotted
coats
pointed
wolfish
ears
and
massive
jaws
they
would
run
up
to
the
very
wheels
howling
and
snapping
with
their
monstrous
yellow
fangs
then
one
would
be
inspired
with
the
idea
of
leaping
aboard
and
finding
out
how
the
occupants
tasted
up
he
would
come
easily
sailing
over
the
railing
usually
the
occupants
would
discourage
him
with
a
thrust
from
a
spear
or
an
amputating
swing
of
a
cutlass
sometimes
they
missed
and
he
would
land
on
the
deck
which
enabled
the
sailors
to
try
again
with
better
success
back
over
the
rail
his
body
would
go
back
to
his
fellows
many
of
whom
would
stop
the
chase
to
devour
their
dead
comrade
those
who
persisted
in
the
hunt
would
then
try
their
luck
bounding
upon
the
yacht
snarling
hideously
trying
to
scare
their
quarry
into
a
complete
paralysis
and
sometimes
succeeding
no
lives
were
lost
to
the
dire
dogs
but
almost
everybody
bore
scars
only
lady
luck
managed
to
stay
unscathed
every
time
she
heard
their
distant
howling
she
scaled
the
mast
and
would
not
come
down
until
the
danger
was
over
today
they
not
been
bothered
everybody
relaxed
chattering
and
munching
happily
the
unexciting
but
nutritious
meat
of
the
miran
stood
upon
the
foredeck
sighting
at
the
sun
through
his
sextant
this
also
had
been
found
in
the
locker
along
with
some
charts
of
the
xurdimur
though
the
charts
had
had
their
locations
marked
in
an
alphabet
unknown
to
anybody
aboard
miran
had
been
able
to
compare
them
in
his
mind
to
the
charts
he
left
on
the
of
he
had
crossed
out
the
foreign
names
and
put
in
names
in
the
kilkrzan
alphabet
he
done
this
only
at
the
insistence
of
green
who
trust
miran
to
translate
for
him
and
wanted
to
be
able
to
read
the
maps
himself
not
only
that
he
forced
the
fat
merchant
to
teach
both
him
and
amra
how
to
use
the
clumsy
and
complicated
but
fairly
accurate
sextant
a
few
days
later
after
green
and
his
wife
had
begun
to
study
the
navigation
instrument
there
occurred
the
accident
that
forced
green
to
take
further
measures
to
safeguard
himself
he
and
miran
had
been
standing
at
the
stern
ready
with
their
pistols
while
amra
steered
the
yacht
toward
a
group
of
they
were
going
through
their
usual
maneuver
of
running
down
a
herd
until
the
exhausted
animals
could
be
overtaken
just
as
they
neared
an
stallion
galloping
furiously
green
raised
his
pistol
at
the
same
time
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
miran
had
also
sighted
but
had
stepped
back
behind
and
to
one
side
of
him
sensitive
about
wasting
any
of
the
valuable
ammunition
green
had
turned
his
head
to
warn
miran
not
to
shoot
unless
he
green
missed
it
was
then
that
he
saw
the
muzzle
swerving
toward
the
back
of
his
head
he
ducked
fully
expecting
to
get
his
brains
blown
out
before
he
could
shout
a
warning
but
miran
seeing
his
reaction
lowered
the
muzzle
and
puzzledly
asked
green
what
he
was
doing
green
did
answer
instead
he
took
the
gun
away
from
miran
limp
grip
and
silently
put
it
away
in
the
locker
neither
he
nor
the
merchant
ever
referred
to
the
incident
nor
did
miran
ask
why
he
was
not
permitted
to
take
part
in
any
shooting
thereafter
that
convinced
green
that
the
fellow
had
fully
intended
to
shoot
him
and
then
claim
to
the
others
that
it
had
been
an
accident
to
forestall
any
more
attempts
at
accidents
green
told
amra
that
if
he
were
to
disappear
some
dark
night
she
was
to
see
that
a
certain
person
was
shot
and
thrown
overboard
he
did
not
name
the
certain
person
but
he
mentioned
his
sex
and
as
miran
was
the
only
other
man
on
the
yacht
there
was
no
doubt
about
to
whom
he
referred
thereafter
miran
was
most
cooperative
always
smiling
and
joking
however
green
caught
him
now
and
then
with
frowning
brows
and
a
thoughtful
expression
he
was
either
fingering
his
stiletto
or
the
bag
of
jewels
he
carried
inside
his
shirt
green
could
imagine
that
he
was
planning
something
for
the
day
they
reached
estorya
now
on
this
day
two
weeks
after
they
left
the
island
miran
was
shooting
the
sun
and
green
was
waiting
until
he
was
through
so
he
could
check
on
him
if
his
calculations
were
correct
the
yacht
should
be
directly
east
of
estorya
two
hundred
miles
if
they
maintained
their
average
rate
of
miles
an
hour
they
reach
the
windbreak
in
a
little
over
eight
hours
the
fat
merchant
quit
looking
through
the
eyepiece
of
his
instrument
and
walked
to
the
cockpit
where
his
charts
and
papers
were
green
took
the
sextant
from
him
and
made
his
own
observations
then
checked
with
miran
in
the
narrow
and
crowded
cockpit
we
agree
said
green
indicating
with
the
pencil
tip
a
round
scarlet
spot
on
the
chart
we
should
be
sighting
this
island
within
four
hours
yes
replied
miran
that
is
an
old
landmark
it
has
been
there
a
hundred
miles
due
east
of
estorya
since
before
my
grandfather
time
it
was
once
a
roaming
island
but
it
long
ago
quit
moving
and
has
stayed
in
that
one
spot
that
is
nothing
unusual
every
captain
knows
of
these
fixed
islands
scattered
all
over
the
xurdimur
and
every
now
and
then
we
have
to
add
a
new
red
mark
to
our
charts
because
one
of
the
roamers
has
settled
down
he
paused
then
added
a
statement
that
set
green
heart
to
beating
fast
the
unusual
thing
about
this
island
is
that
it
did
not
stop
of
its
own
accord
it
was
halted
by
the
magic
of
the
estoryans
and
it
has
been
kept
in
that
one
place
ever
since
by
their
magic
what
do
you
mean
asked
green
eagerly
miran
round
eye
stared
at
him
blankly
what
do
you
mean
what
do
i
mean
i
mean
just
what
i
said
nothing
more
i
mean
what
magic
did
they
contrive
to
halt
this
roamer
why
they
put
up
certain
peculiar
towers
in
its
path
and
when
the
island
began
going
backwards
to
get
out
of
the
trap
and
go
around
it
they
moved
other
towers
to
block
its
retreat
these
towers
moved
fast
on
many
wheels
once
the
circle
was
completed
the
island
could
move
nor
has
it
been
able
to
move
since
these
towers
intrigue
me
how
did
the
estoryans
know
how
to
halt
these
islands
and
if
they
succeeded
with
one
why
not
with
the
others
i
do
not
know
perhaps
because
the
towers
are
huge
and
costly
and
do
move
too
fast
perhaps
it
is
not
worthwhile
to
the
estoryans
to
capture
many
as
for
their
knowledge
i
think
they
got
it
from
their
ancestors
it
was
their
who
originally
built
estorya
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
and
protected
it
from
being
crushed
by
these
islands
by
placing
these
many
towers
all
around
their
city
but
it
cost
them
much
wood
and
time
and
perhaps
they
lost
interest
after
that
miran
indicated
a
castle
inked
in
beside
the
red
spot
that
castle
means
that
a
military
or
naval
fortification
has
been
built
there
on
the
island
it
is
the
furtherest
eastern
garrison
of
the
estoryans
when
we
come
within
sighting
distance
of
it
we
are
supposed
to
report
of
course
if
you
wish
to
avoid
it
we
may
sail
to
the
north
or
south
and
swing
around
it
but
then
we
will
have
to
report
to
the
windbreak
master
of
the
city
itself
and
they
are
rather
hostile
to
captains
who
have
failed
to
have
their
papers
checked
at
the
fort
of
shimdoog
even
if
the
craft
is
such
a
small
and
weak
one
as
this
the
estoryans
are
a
suspicious
people
yes
thought
green
and
i
bet
that
you
intend
to
inflate
their
distrust
with
certain
information
about
me
he
rose
from
the
cockpit
and
at
the
same
time
he
heard
amra
hail
him
from
her
station
at
the
helm
island
on
the
horizon
she
said
and
many
glittering
white
objects
placed
before
it
green
refrained
from
comment
but
he
had
a
hard
time
concealing
his
excitement
which
grew
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
he
paced
back
and
forth
stopping
now
and
then
to
shade
his
eyes
and
look
long
at
the
white
towers
finally
as
they
got
so
near
that
he
could
no
longer
be
mistaken
about
their
size
or
the
details
of
their
peculiar
structure
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
whooped
with
joy
and
kissed
amra
on
the
cheek
and
danced
around
and
around
the
foredeck
while
the
women
stared
with
embarrassment
and
concern
and
the
children
giggled
all
wondering
if
he
gone
mad
spaceships
spaceships
he
howled
in
english
dozens
of
them
it
must
be
an
expedition
i
saved
saved
spaceships
spaceships
they
were
a
magnificent
sight
those
many
cones
pointing
their
skyscraping
noses
upward
and
their
spreading
landing
struts
sinking
into
the
soft
earth
their
white
eternum
metal
gleamed
in
the
sun
dazzling
the
spectator
who
happened
to
catch
their
radiance
full
in
the
eyes
they
were
glorious
embodying
all
the
vast
wisdom
and
skill
of
the
greatest
civilization
of
the
galaxy
no
wonder
thought
green
that
i
dance
and
howl
while
these
people
look
at
me
as
if
i
mad
and
amra
tears
in
her
eyes
shakes
her
head
and
says
something
to
herself
what
can
they
know
of
the
meaning
of
those
splendors
what
indeed
hey
shouted
green
hey
here
i
am
an
earthman
maybe
i
look
like
one
of
these
barbarians
with
my
long
hair
and
bushy
beard
and
dirty
skin
but
i
not
i
alan
green
an
earthman
of
course
they
could
have
heard
him
at
that
distance
even
if
somebody
had
been
standing
beneath
the
spaceships
to
hear
him
but
he
howled
with
sheer
exuberance
not
worrying
about
wasting
his
breath
and
making
himself
hoarse
finally
amra
interrupted
him
what
is
the
matter
alan
have
you
been
bitten
by
the
green
bird
of
happiness
which
sometimes
flies
over
these
plains
or
has
the
white
bird
of
terror
nipped
you
while
you
slept
last
night
upon
the
open
deck
green
paused
and
looked
steadily
at
her
could
he
tell
her
the
truth
now
he
was
so
near
salvation
it
was
not
that
he
was
worried
about
her
or
the
others
stopping
him
from
making
contact
with
the
expedition
nothing
could
stop
him
now
he
was
sure
of
that
it
was
just
that
he
hesitated
to
tell
her
that
he
would
be
leaving
her
the
idea
of
hurting
her
was
agony
to
him
he
started
to
speak
in
english
caught
himself
and
switched
to
her
language
those
vessels
they
have
brought
my
people
from
across
the
space
between
the
stars
i
came
to
this
world
in
just
such
a
vessel
a
spaceroller
you
might
say
my
ship
crashed
and
i
was
forced
to
descend
upon
this
your
world
then
i
heard
that
another
ship
had
landed
near
estorya
and
that
king
raussmig
had
put
the
crew
in
prison
and
was
going
to
sacrifice
them
during
the
festival
of
the
sun
eye
i
had
little
time
to
get
to
estorya
before
that
happened
so
i
talked
miran
into
taking
me
that
was
why
i
left
you
that
he
trailed
off
because
he
did
not
understand
the
expression
upon
her
face
it
was
not
the
great
hurt
he
expected
nor
the
wild
fury
he
thought
might
result
from
his
explanation
if
anything
she
looked
pitying
why
alan
whatever
are
you
talking
about
he
pointed
at
the
line
of
spaceships
they
from
terra
my
home
planet
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
by
your
home
planet
she
replied
still
pityingly
but
those
are
not
spaceships
those
are
the
towers
built
by
the
estoryans
a
thousand
years
ago
do
you
mean
stunned
he
looked
at
them
again
if
those
were
starships
he
eat
the
yacht
canvas
yes
and
the
wheels
too
under
the
swift
wind
the
swept
closer
and
closer
while
he
stood
behind
amra
and
thought
that
he
break
into
little
pieces
if
his
tension
did
find
some
release
finally
it
did
find
an
outlet
tears
welled
in
his
eyes
and
he
choked
his
breast
seemed
as
if
it
would
swell
up
and
burst
how
cleverly
the
ancient
builders
had
fashioned
those
towers
the
landing
struts
the
big
fins
the
long
sweeping
lines
ending
in
the
pointed
nose
all
must
have
been
built
with
a
spaceship
as
a
model
there
was
no
escaping
such
a
conclusion
coincidence
could
explain
it
amra
said
do
cry
alan
your
people
will
think
you
weak
captains
do
weep
this
captain
does
he
replied
and
he
turned
and
walked
the
length
of
the
yacht
to
the
stern
and
leaned
over
the
taffrail
where
no
one
could
see
him
as
he
shook
with
sobs
presently
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
alan
she
said
gently
tell
me
the
truth
if
those
had
been
ships
on
which
you
could
leave
this
world
and
travel
into
the
skies
would
you
have
taken
me
along
were
you
still
thinking
that
i
was
not
not
good
enough
for
you
let
not
talk
about
it
now
he
said
i
ca
besides
there
are
too
many
people
listening
later
when
everybody
asleep
all
right
alan
she
released
his
hand
and
left
him
alone
knowing
that
that
was
what
he
wanted
mentally
he
thanked
her
for
it
because
he
knew
what
it
was
costing
her
to
exercise
restraint
at
any
other
time
in
a
like
situation
she
would
have
thrown
something
at
him
after
he
had
calmed
down
somewhat
he
returned
to
the
helm
and
took
over
from
miran
from
then
on
he
was
too
busy
to
think
much
about
his
disappointment
he
had
to
report
to
the
port
officer
and
tell
his
story
which
took
hours
for
the
officer
called
in
the
others
to
hear
his
amazing
tale
and
they
questioned
miran
and
amra
green
anxiously
listened
to
the
merchant
account
fearful
that
the
fellow
would
disclose
his
suspicions
that
green
was
not
what
he
claimed
to
be
if
miran
had
any
such
intentions
however
he
was
saving
them
for
their
arrival
in
estorya
itself
the
officers
all
agreed
that
they
had
heard
many
wonderful
stories
from
sailors
but
never
anything
to
match
this
they
insisted
upon
giving
a
banquet
for
miran
and
green
the
result
was
that
green
got
a
and
desired
bath
hair
cut
and
shave
but
he
also
had
to
endure
a
long
feast
in
which
he
had
to
stuff
himself
to
keep
from
offending
his
hosts
and
also
was
forced
to
enter
a
drinking
contest
with
some
of
the
younger
blades
of
the
post
his
vigilante
could
handle
enormous
amounts
of
food
and
alcohol
so
that
green
appeared
to
the
soldiers
to
be
something
of
a
superman
at
midnight
the
last
officer
had
dropped
his
head
upon
the
table
dead
drunk
and
green
was
able
to
get
up
and
go
to
his
yacht
unfortunately
he
had
to
carry
the
fat
merchant
out
on
his
shoulders
outside
the
banquet
room
he
found
a
few
rickshaw
boys
standing
around
a
fire
huddled
together
waiting
for
a
customer
so
drunk
he
fear
thieves
or
ghosts
he
gave
one
of
them
a
coin
and
told
him
to
deliver
miran
to
the
yacht
what
about
yourself
honored
sir
do
you
wish
to
ride
home
too
later
said
green
looking
up
past
the
fort
and
at
the
hills
behind
it
i
intend
to
take
a
walk
to
clear
my
head
before
the
rickshaw
men
could
question
him
further
he
plunged
into
the
darkness
and
began
striding
swiftly
toward
the
highest
peak
upon
the
island
two
hours
later
he
suddenly
appeared
in
the
windbreak
walked
past
the
many
vessels
tied
down
for
the
night
and
crawled
aboard
his
own
yacht
a
glance
around
the
deck
convinced
him
that
everybody
was
sleeping
he
stepped
softly
past
the
prostrate
forms
and
lay
down
by
amra
face
up
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
stared
at
the
moon
a
thoughtful
expression
upon
his
face
amra
whispered
alan
i
thought
you
were
going
to
talk
to
me
tonight
he
stiffened
but
did
not
turn
his
head
to
look
at
her
i
was
but
the
officers
kept
us
up
late
did
miran
get
here
yes
about
five
minutes
before
you
did
he
rose
on
one
elbow
and
looked
searchingly
at
her
is
there
anything
strange
about
that
only
that
he
was
so
drunk
he
passed
out
and
was
snoring
like
a
pig
the
fat
son
of
an
he
must
have
been
faking
and
he
must
have
must
have
what
green
shrugged
i
do
know
he
could
tell
her
that
miran
must
have
followed
him
up
into
the
hills
and
that
if
he
had
the
fellow
must
have
seen
some
very
disturbing
things
he
stood
up
and
gazed
intently
at
the
dark
forms
stretched
out
here
and
there
miran
was
sleeping
upon
a
blanket
behind
the
helm
or
was
pretending
to
do
so
should
he
kill
him
if
miran
turned
him
in
to
the
authorities
in
estorya
he
sat
down
again
and
fingered
his
dagger
amra
must
have
guessed
his
thoughts
for
she
said
why
do
you
want
to
kill
him
you
know
why
because
he
could
have
me
burned
she
sucked
her
breath
in
with
a
hiss
alan
it
ca
be
true
you
ca
be
a
demon
to
him
the
accusation
was
so
ridiculous
that
he
did
bother
to
answer
he
should
have
known
better
because
he
was
well
aware
of
how
seriously
these
people
took
such
things
however
he
was
thinking
so
furiously
about
what
he
could
do
to
forestall
miran
that
he
completely
forgot
about
her
not
until
he
heard
her
muffled
sobs
did
he
come
out
of
his
reverie
surprised
he
said
do
worry
they
not
going
to
burn
me
no
they
not
she
said
choking
on
every
other
word
i
do
care
if
you
a
demon
i
love
you
and
i
go
to
hell
for
you
or
with
you
it
took
him
a
few
seconds
to
understand
that
she
did
believe
he
a
demon
and
that
it
made
no
difference
to
her
or
rather
she
was
determined
to
ignore
the
difference
what
a
sacrifice
of
her
natural
feelings
she
must
have
made
for
him
she
like
everybody
upon
this
world
had
been
trained
from
childhood
to
develop
a
fierce
disgust
and
horror
of
devils
and
to
be
always
upon
her
guard
for
them
when
they
appeared
in
human
form
what
an
abyss
she
had
to
cross
in
order
to
conquer
her
deep
revulsion
in
a
way
her
feat
was
greater
than
crossing
the
chasm
between
the
stars
amra
he
said
deeply
touched
and
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
to
his
surprise
she
turned
her
face
away
you
know
my
lips
do
belch
fire
like
the
devils
in
the
legends
he
said
nor
will
i
suck
your
soul
into
my
mouth
you
have
already
done
that
she
said
still
not
facing
him
oh
amra
yes
you
have
else
why
should
i
follow
you
when
you
deserted
me
to
run
away
on
the
and
why
should
i
still
want
to
follow
you
to
be
with
you
even
if
those
towers
had
turned
out
to
be
your
and
you
had
sailed
away
into
the
skies
on
them
why
would
any
decent
human
woman
want
to
do
that
tell
me
she
too
rose
on
an
elbow
her
face
now
turned
to
him
he
scarcely
recognized
her
her
features
were
so
twisted
and
her
skin
was
so
livid
a
hundred
times
during
this
voyage
i
wished
you
would
die
why
because
then
i
would
have
to
think
about
the
time
to
come
when
you
would
leave
this
world
forever
leave
forever
but
when
you
were
in
danger
then
i
almost
died
too
and
i
knew
i
did
really
wish
your
death
it
was
just
wounded
pride
on
my
part
and
i
could
face
the
moment
of
your
departure
or
the
fact
that
you
must
come
from
a
superior
race
a
people
more
like
gods
than
demons
oh
i
did
know
what
to
think
whether
you
were
a
devil
or
a
god
or
just
a
man
who
was
somehow
more
of
a
man
than
any
i
knew
i
could
ignore
such
things
as
your
wounds
healing
up
faster
than
they
should
and
scar
tissues
disappearing
but
i
could
ignore
your
knowledge
that
aga
would
be
killed
if
she
touched
that
wall
in
the
room
on
the
cannibals
island
nor
the
fact
that
your
teeth
grew
back
in
after
they
were
knocked
out
during
the
escape
from
the
island
nor
your
too
obvious
interest
in
those
two
demons
held
prisoner
in
estorya
or
not
so
loud
amra
he
interrupted
you
wake
everybody
up
all
right
all
right
better
to
keep
quiet
and
pretend
to
be
stupid
but
i
ca
i
not
built
that
way
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
alan
do
do
he
repeated
miserably
why
somehow
or
other
i
going
to
free
those
two
poor
devils
and
escape
in
their
spaceship
devils
then
they
demons
oh
no
that
was
just
a
manner
of
speaking
i
said
poor
devils
because
of
what
they
must
have
gone
through
in
that
barbarous
prison
they
might
as
well
have
been
in
the
hands
of
the
cannibals
as
at
the
mercy
of
the
priests
of
this
wretched
planet
yes
that
what
you
really
think
of
us
is
it
that
we
all
murderous
dirty
and
stinking
savages
oh
not
all
of
you
he
replied
you
not
amra
by
any
standards
you
a
wonderful
woman
then
why
ca
she
bit
her
lip
and
turned
away
from
him
she
would
not
humble
herself
by
asking
him
to
take
her
with
him
it
was
up
to
him
to
make
the
offer
green
did
not
know
what
to
say
though
he
knew
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
something
at
once
he
just
could
not
make
up
his
mind
as
to
how
she
would
fit
into
earth
civilization
how
could
he
teach
her
that
if
somebody
whom
you
did
like
differed
with
you
you
just
did
try
to
tear
them
apart
or
that
if
the
person
you
hated
was
too
powerful
for
you
to
settle
matters
with
personally
you
did
resort
to
professional
assassins
how
could
he
teach
her
to
love
the
same
things
he
did
the
music
and
literature
of
his
own
culture
her
roots
were
in
an
entirely
different
culture
she
could
possibly
understand
what
he
understood
thrill
to
that
which
thrilled
him
catch
the
subtleties
that
he
caught
see
what
lay
behind
the
nuances
of
his
civilization
she
be
a
stranger
in
a
world
not
made
for
her
of
course
he
thought
there
were
plenty
of
women
upon
earth
and
her
who
did
share
his
culture
even
if
they
been
brought
up
in
it
but
their
case
was
simply
a
matter
of
taste
and
they
could
still
share
a
certain
amount
with
him
just
because
they
breathed
the
same
atmosphere
and
talked
the
same
words
as
he
not
that
he
would
have
cared
to
live
with
them
because
he
would
but
amra
desirable
in
so
many
ways
just
would
not
understand
what
was
taking
place
around
her
or
in
the
minds
of
those
she
would
have
to
live
with
he
looked
down
at
amra
her
back
was
turned
and
she
seemed
to
be
breathing
the
easy
breath
of
deep
sleep
though
he
doubted
very
much
that
she
could
be
sleeping
he
decided
to
accept
things
as
they
looked
he
would
answer
her
now
though
he
knew
that
when
morning
came
her
eyes
would
be
asking
the
same
question
even
if
she
did
voice
it
at
least
he
thought
she
been
diverted
from
her
curiosity
about
what
he
been
doing
that
night
that
was
something
he
did
want
anybody
to
know
about
that
not
until
the
time
for
action
came
provided
that
is
that
he
could
do
anything
even
then
he
discovered
certain
things
tonight
that
could
mean
his
salvation
if
he
could
utilize
them
that
was
the
rub
as
some
poet
or
other
had
once
said
wondering
just
who
had
originated
that
saying
he
fell
asleep
woolgathering
had
always
been
a
favorite
occupation
of
his
when
people
left
him
alone
to
do
it
that
was
the
rub
they
did
shortly
after
dawn
the
yacht
set
sail
and
sped
toward
estorya
a
hundred
miles
west
the
breeze
was
a
strong
miles
an
hour
precursor
of
the
violent
winds
that
roared
across
the
xurdimur
during
the
rainy
season
green
set
every
inch
of
sail
he
had
and
took
over
the
helm
himself
steering
was
not
as
simple
as
it
had
been
for
traffic
was
getting
heavy
in
an
hour
he
saw
no
less
than
forty
ranging
in
size
from
small
merchants
not
much
larger
than
his
own
craft
to
tremendous
from
batrim
convoying
even
larger
merchant
vessels
and
richly
decorated
then
as
they
came
to
within
fifty
miles
of
their
destination
small
pleasure
yachts
appeared
in
increasing
numbers
and
by
the
time
they
saw
the
white
towers
that
stretched
from
horizon
to
horizon
green
was
sweating
at
the
manner
in
which
craft
were
shooting
back
and
forth
in
front
of
him
miran
said
the
entire
nation
is
surrounded
by
these
white
towers
and
by
many
fortresses
interspersed
between
them
inside
the
great
circle
of
towers
the
estoryans
have
many
rich
farms
on
the
plains
the
city
proper
however
is
built
on
three
roaming
islands
that
were
captured
by
their
magic
many
centuries
ago
green
raised
his
eyebrows
at
this
information
indeed
and
where
is
the
vessel
that
brought
the
two
demons
down
from
the
skies
miran
looked
blankly
at
the
earthman
though
he
knew
well
enough
that
he
was
keenly
interested
in
the
demons
oh
it
is
located
close
to
the
palace
of
the
king
himself
but
not
on
the
hills
it
landed
on
the
plain
hmm
and
the
strangers
will
be
burned
during
the
festival
of
the
eye
of
the
sun
if
they
have
lived
they
will
be
green
did
like
to
think
about
their
dying
if
they
had
then
his
problem
was
solved
he
stayed
upon
this
planet
and
did
the
best
he
could
here
there
was
one
thing
he
had
to
admit
that
was
that
having
amra
as
his
wife
made
such
an
event
not
so
calamitous
as
it
might
have
been
keep
him
so
interested
that
time
would
pass
swiftly
even
on
this
barbarous
place
in
that
case
he
thought
why
was
he
hesitating
about
taking
her
to
earth
if
he
got
the
chance
no
matter
where
he
was
she
see
that
life
was
a
whirlpool
of
action
and
she
only
begun
to
disclose
the
deeps
within
her
give
her
an
education
and
what
a
creature
might
evolve
what
the
matter
with
you
green
he
said
to
himself
do
you
know
your
own
mind
are
you
so
capable
at
handling
physical
events
but
a
complete
muckup
when
it
comes
to
psychical
why
look
out
cried
miran
and
green
threw
the
helm
hard
aport
to
avoid
crashing
into
a
small
freighter
the
captain
standing
on
the
foredeck
behind
his
own
helmsman
leaned
over
the
rail
and
shook
his
fist
at
green
and
cursed
green
cursed
back
but
after
that
he
did
allow
himself
to
begin
thinking
about
amra
until
he
had
steered
the
into
the
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
busy
getting
cleared
with
the
port
authorities
fortunately
he
had
a
letter
from
the
officer
of
the
it
explained
why
he
happened
to
be
in
possession
of
a
foreign
craft
and
also
recommended
that
green
be
given
a
chance
to
sign
up
in
the
estoryan
if
he
wished
even
so
he
had
to
tell
his
story
so
many
times
to
an
admiring
and
amazingly
credulous
audience
that
it
was
dusk
before
he
could
get
free
outside
the
customs
building
he
found
grizquetr
waiting
for
him
where
your
mother
he
asked
oh
she
knew
you
be
tied
up
for
a
long
time
so
she
went
ahead
and
got
a
room
in
an
inn
they
very
hard
to
get
during
the
festival
almost
impossible
but
you
know
mother
said
grizquetr
winking
she
gets
what
she
goes
after
every
time
yes
i
afraid
so
well
where
this
inn
it
clear
across
town
but
it
within
sight
of
the
wall
that
built
around
the
demons
skyship
wonderful
rooms
must
be
twice
as
difficult
to
get
there
as
on
the
edge
of
town
how
did
amra
do
it
she
gave
the
innkeeper
three
times
his
asking
price
which
was
high
enough
and
he
found
a
pretext
to
quarrel
with
a
man
who
had
long
ago
reserved
a
room
threw
him
out
and
gave
it
to
us
ah
and
where
did
she
get
this
money
she
sold
a
ruby
to
a
jeweler
who
kept
shop
close
to
the
sort
of
shady
i
guess
and
he
did
give
mother
what
the
ruby
was
worth
now
where
would
she
get
a
ruby
or
any
kind
of
jewel
grizquetr
grinned
crookedly
but
delightedly
oh
i
imagine
that
a
certain
fat
who
shall
remain
nameless
must
have
had
one
or
two
rubies
within
that
bag
he
keeps
inside
his
shirt
yes
i
can
imagine
the
question
that
alarms
me
is
how
did
she
get
it
off
miran
he
sooner
lose
a
quart
of
blood
than
one
of
his
precious
jewels
and
he
notice
its
loss
quicker
than
he
would
the
blood
grizquetr
looked
thoughtful
i
really
do
know
mother
did
say
he
brightened
with
a
smile
and
said
but
i
to
know
how
she
did
it
maybe
she
teach
me
some
day
she
seems
to
have
a
lot
to
teach
both
of
us
said
green
he
sighed
well
i
eternally
indebted
to
her
no
getting
out
of
it
let
call
a
rickshaw
and
see
what
kind
of
a
place
she
has
selected
once
both
had
settled
in
the
chair
of
their
vehicle
and
the
two
men
who
pulled
it
had
begun
their
slow
trotting
through
the
crowded
streets
green
said
have
you
any
idea
where
miran
is
some
he
was
detained
by
the
too
because
he
had
to
explain
what
had
happened
to
his
then
he
called
a
rickshaw
and
left
in
a
big
hurry
he
had
an
officer
with
him
not
a
naval
officer
a
soldier
from
the
palace
one
of
the
king
own
green
felt
a
sinking
sensation
already
tell
me
does
he
know
where
we
are
staying
oh
no
when
i
saw
him
coming
out
of
the
customshouse
i
hid
behind
a
bale
of
cotton
mother
had
told
me
to
stay
out
of
his
sight
she
explained
how
treacherous
he
is
and
how
he
hates
you
because
he
thinks
you
brought
all
his
bad
luck
upon
him
that
only
the
half
of
it
green
replied
he
was
silent
for
a
while
thinking
his
gaze
roving
idly
over
the
crowds
there
were
many
foreigners
in
town
sailors
from
every
nation
that
had
a
border
on
the
xurdimur
pilgrims
who
belonged
to
the
cult
of
the
fish
goddess
and
had
come
here
for
the
festival
the
majority
however
were
estoryans
a
fairly
tall
people
brown
or
green
or
with
big
noses
thick
lips
and
a
slight
epicanthic
fold
they
spoke
a
guttural
polysyllabic
language
they
wore
hats
shaped
like
open
umbrellas
shirts
with
long
stringties
and
pants
that
were
from
crotch
to
knee
then
ballooned
out
into
many
ruffles
little
bells
tinkled
on
their
ankles
and
the
women
carried
canes
all
had
a
fish
a
star
or
a
tower
tattooed
on
their
cheeks
along
the
narrow
winding
street
were
many
little
shops
flowering
with
a
variety
of
articles
green
was
intrigued
by
the
magical
charms
being
hawked
everywhere
many
of
these
were
little
towers
replicas
of
the
large
ones
that
encircled
the
country
on
earth
they
could
have
passed
for
toy
spaceships
he
bought
one
it
was
made
of
wood
and
was
about
seven
inches
long
the
big
flaring
fins
and
landing
struts
were
well
reproduced
but
there
were
any
of
the
fine
details
that
he
could
have
found
in
such
a
toy
on
earth
there
were
no
holes
in
the
stern
or
nose
for
the
or
any
indications
of
doors
or
detector
apparatus
he
gave
it
to
grizquetr
and
leaned
back
to
do
some
more
thinking
the
charm
had
disappointed
him
because
he
had
not
expected
any
more
than
what
he
seen
if
in
the
beginning
those
models
had
been
furnished
with
every
little
detail
the
passage
of
many
thousands
of
years
would
have
seen
them
blunted
and
reduced
to
their
present
state
of
fuzzy
symbolic
images
time
ate
down
to
the
skeleton
of
things
he
wondered
how
the
charm
could
have
survived
up
to
the
present
because
it
surely
must
have
been
over
twenty
thousand
years
ago
that
the
prototype
the
real
spaceship
disappeared
and
man
sank
back
to
savagery
again
then
why
had
this
lasted
here
whereas
it
had
not
done
so
on
other
planets
earth
included
abruptly
he
noticed
that
his
rickshaw
had
stopped
a
procession
of
priests
going
to
the
palace
of
the
king
where
they
will
spend
all
night
preaching
to
the
demon
said
one
of
their
rickshaw
boys
he
yawned
and
stretched
i
suppose
that
it
will
be
a
fine
burning
since
the
priests
have
predicted
that
the
sun
will
shine
at
high
noon
they
are
safe
doing
that
as
it
has
not
failed
to
shine
on
festival
day
for
a
thousand
years
green
leaned
forward
his
hands
gripping
the
sides
of
his
chair
and
said
demon
you
meant
demons
did
you
were
there
two
of
them
oh
yes
there
were
but
one
died
two
days
ago
hung
himself
i
heard
though
i
ca
swear
to
it
since
the
priests
have
released
no
details
the
holy
ones
have
been
giving
the
demons
a
rough
time
demons
said
grizquetr
snorting
with
disbelief
and
disgust
the
very
fact
that
one
killed
himself
prove
they
not
fiends
everyone
knows
that
a
demon
ca
kill
himself
quite
true
my
small
friend
replied
the
taxi
man
the
priests
have
admitted
their
error
they
are
truly
sorry
so
they
say
then
are
they
letting
the
other
man
loose
oh
no
because
may
still
be
a
demon
tomorrow
at
high
noon
the
prisoner
goes
under
the
sun
eye
and
there
meets
the
only
death
a
demon
may
know
fire
he
was
born
by
fire
he
shall
chapter
twenty
verse
or
so
i
remember
the
high
grauchning
saying
in
his
sermon
yesterday
myself
i
not
much
for
reading
too
busy
making
a
living
running
my
legs
off
killing
myself
so
my
wife
and
kids
may
eat
and
have
clothes
on
their
backs
green
scarcely
heard
the
garrulous
rickshaw
man
so
shocked
was
he
at
the
news
had
he
been
too
late
what
if
the
man
who
died
was
the
pilot
and
the
other
one
unable
to
handle
the
ship
the
rest
of
the
ride
he
was
sunk
in
such
deep
gloom
he
hardly
saw
any
of
the
many
sights
that
grizquetr
kept
pointing
out
but
he
did
rouse
when
the
boy
said
look
father
there
the
king
palace
on
top
of
the
hill
beyond
that
is
the
ship
of
the
demon
you
ca
see
it
from
here
but
you
will
tomorrow
when
you
go
to
the
burning
do
be
so
heartless
said
green
but
he
looked
carefully
at
the
great
marble
structure
that
rambled
all
over
the
hill
somewhere
below
that
probably
filled
with
dirt
undoubtedly
forgotten
was
just
such
an
entrance
as
he
found
on
the
island
of
the
cannibals
he
also
discovered
a
similar
one
upon
the
fortress
of
shimdoog
the
night
before
when
he
gone
exploring
and
miran
had
followed
him
the
palace
he
thought
looked
quite
romantic
and
beautiful
enveloped
in
a
dim
red
haze
cast
by
the
setting
sun
which
lay
directly
behind
it
probably
it
would
look
different
in
the
harsh
glare
of
day
when
the
dirt
and
garbage
would
be
so
apparent
the
area
in
which
amra
had
rented
the
room
was
one
which
had
once
belonged
to
the
rich
and
the
noble
but
had
decayed
when
the
aristocracy
moved
their
homes
elsewhere
the
inn
before
which
the
rickshaw
boys
stopped
was
a
pile
of
granite
blocks
it
had
an
enormous
porch
and
six
huge
pillars
in
the
images
of
the
fish
goddess
green
could
not
help
admiring
the
building
even
in
its
present
state
of
decay
because
he
knew
that
it
must
have
cost
a
fortune
to
build
it
the
granite
would
have
had
to
be
transported
by
across
the
xurdimur
since
there
would
be
no
stone
in
this
neighborhood
he
imagined
that
the
landlord
charged
high
rents
and
that
amra
must
have
paid
a
pretty
price
indeed
if
she
given
him
three
times
the
usual
amount
one
thing
you
could
say
for
her
when
she
traveled
she
did
it
in
style
the
caryatids
of
the
fish
goddess
also
interested
him
and
at
another
time
he
have
examined
them
closely
by
the
light
of
the
torches
in
the
hands
of
the
servants
standing
by
them
the
cult
of
the
goddess
indicated
that
the
original
estoryans
must
have
migrated
from
the
oceanside
to
the
center
of
the
vast
and
level
plains
and
here
they
must
have
built
this
imposing
city
which
was
to
become
such
a
great
focus
of
trade
its
central
location
made
it
a
great
clearing
house
for
goods
from
every
country
bordering
the
xurdimur
he
wondered
whether
it
was
pure
accident
that
they
had
brought
with
them
the
charms
in
the
shapes
of
spaceships
and
if
they
also
accidentally
discovered
that
towers
modeled
after
the
charms
would
stop
the
roaming
islands
whatever
the
answer
it
lay
buried
in
the
prehistoric
hurry
up
said
grizquetr
pulling
on
green
hand
mother
has
a
surprise
for
you
but
do
tell
her
i
told
you
that
nice
replied
green
absently
his
mind
still
upon
the
news
of
the
earthman
death
hang
it
all
why
must
he
always
be
kept
in
suspense
must
always
be
improvising
from
moment
to
moment
always
in
the
dark
never
knowing
what
was
coming
next
nor
what
he
was
going
to
have
to
do
oh
for
one
day
of
peace
and
assurance
father
what
what
said
green
startled
out
of
his
reverie
and
stopping
halfway
up
the
steps
to
the
porch
suddenly
something
black
and
small
launched
itself
at
him
and
landed
on
his
shoulder
lady
luck
why
are
you
shivering
so
better
run
dad
said
grizquetr
there
miran
coming
out
of
the
door
and
soldiers
behind
him
he
ended
with
a
wail
the
sight
of
amra
inzax
and
the
children
being
marched
out
between
musketmen
was
enough
for
green
he
turned
away
and
spoke
softly
but
savagely
keep
your
backs
to
them
do
look
back
we
far
enough
away
in
the
dark
so
they
might
not
recognize
us
especially
in
this
crowd
a
minute
later
he
and
the
boy
and
the
cat
were
looking
around
the
corner
of
a
large
building
they
saw
the
soldiers
commandeer
a
rickshaw
and
put
the
prisoners
in
it
then
four
of
them
walked
behind
the
vehicle
as
it
was
pulled
away
they
they
be
put
in
the
tower
of
the
grass
cat
said
the
boy
shaking
with
fury
oh
that
devil
miran
that
fat
old
devil
he
the
one
who
accused
mother
of
witchcraft
i
know
i
know
he
did
accuse
her
said
green
but
me
she
guilty
through
association
with
me
well
at
least
we
know
where
they
are
for
a
while
there
go
miran
and
the
soldiers
back
into
the
hotel
waiting
for
us
said
green
they
have
a
long
wait
well
go
first
things
first
we
buy
a
ticket
see
the
ship
i
have
to
know
where
it
located
what
type
it
is
et
cetera
luckily
enough
money
on
me
to
do
that
but
we
be
broke
then
you
have
any
ten
that
not
much
but
it
enough
to
pay
for
a
rickshaw
ride
to
the
windbreak
at
the
green
bought
two
tickets
then
walked
up
the
steep
flight
of
steps
with
grizquetr
at
the
top
he
found
himself
in
a
large
group
standing
on
a
platform
beneath
a
wooden
roof
this
was
for
the
curious
who
wanted
to
get
a
preview
of
the
demons
vessel
tomorrow
the
gates
would
be
opened
to
admit
a
vast
crowd
who
would
sit
on
the
hard
wooden
seats
of
the
amphitheatre
that
had
been
built
fairly
close
to
the
ship
the
ship
itself
was
an
earth
naval
vessel
a
scout
it
pointed
its
needle
nose
upward
resting
upon
eight
jetstruts
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
its
naval
insignia
a
green
globe
crossed
with
rocket
and
olive
branch
was
a
smudge
in
the
shadows
nevertheless
he
could
make
it
out
he
felt
his
breast
swell
and
he
choked
with
homesickness
ah
so
near
yet
so
far
he
murmured
even
if
i
get
to
you
then
what
what
if
the
poor
devil
of
a
survivor
turns
out
to
be
a
navigator
still
he
ought
to
know
enough
to
get
her
off
the
ground
and
into
space
and
from
there
on
with
interstellar
drive
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
home
somehow
he
sounded
plaintive
even
to
himself
for
he
knew
how
vast
space
was
and
how
complicated
astromathematics
was
and
of
course
there
was
no
guarantee
that
the
earthman
would
even
be
a
navigator
he
might
just
be
an
officer
or
perhaps
a
civilian
official
who
was
being
ferried
in
one
of
the
swifter
small
ships
then
there
was
the
awful
possibility
that
the
vessel
might
have
landed
here
because
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
and
that
it
could
not
rise
again
even
if
it
had
a
full
crew
in
fact
that
was
the
most
logical
explanation
he
sighed
and
turned
to
the
boy
this
may
be
for
nothing
but
we
ca
just
sit
down
and
watch
take
off
for
the
windbreak
what
are
we
going
to
do
there
asked
grizquetr
as
they
walked
down
the
steps
well
we
not
going
back
to
the
yacht
green
answered
be
waiting
there
to
arrest
us
no
we
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
stealing
another
is
going
to
get
us
in
any
more
trouble
than
we
already
in
the
boy
eyes
widened
what
we
doing
that
for
we
must
return
to
the
of
shimdoog
what
why
that
a
hundred
miles
away
yes
i
know
and
we
wo
be
able
to
make
the
speed
going
back
that
we
did
coming
we
have
to
do
quite
a
lot
of
tacking
to
sail
against
the
wind
and
that
eat
up
our
time
but
there
nothing
else
to
do
if
you
say
so
father
i
believe
you
but
what
is
there
on
shimdoog
not
on
grizquetr
was
a
bright
lad
he
was
silent
for
a
minute
so
silent
green
could
imagine
he
heard
the
wheels
turning
within
his
head
then
he
said
there
must
be
a
cave
on
shimdoog
like
the
one
on
the
island
and
you
must
have
gone
into
it
that
night
we
stayed
in
the
i
remember
waking
up
and
hearing
you
and
mother
say
something
about
your
being
gone
and
about
miran
following
you
grizquetr
paused
then
said
if
there
is
a
there
why
have
other
people
gone
into
it
because
it
has
been
declared
taboo
off
limits
by
the
priests
of
estorya
it
was
done
so
long
ago
that
i
imagine
that
the
priests
themselves
have
forgotten
why
they
forbade
its
access
to
men
but
not
hard
to
reconstruct
the
historical
causes
once
i
suppose
the
island
was
populated
by
cannibals
at
the
time
the
estoryans
captured
the
island
they
exterminated
the
aborigines
they
found
the
cave
mouth
was
a
holy
place
for
the
savages
so
thinking
that
it
held
demons
and
it
does
in
a
way
they
built
a
wall
around
it
and
set
up
a
statue
of
the
fish
goddess
facing
inward
and
holding
in
her
hand
a
symbol
to
restrain
the
imprisoned
fiends
from
breaking
loose
that
symbol
of
course
is
the
same
charm
that
is
sold
on
the
streets
of
estorya
that
circumscribes
the
country
and
the
island
of
shimdoog
it
is
the
same
as
the
spaceship
that
landed
near
the
king
palace
green
hailed
a
rickshaw
and
continued
his
account
while
they
rode
through
the
streets
there
was
so
much
noise
that
he
felt
quite
safe
talking
provided
he
kept
his
voice
soft
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
northern
end
of
the
windbreak
green
had
told
the
boy
all
he
thought
he
should
hear
at
that
time
if
later
on
his
trip
to
shimdoog
proved
successful
he
would
enlighten
him
even
more
for
the
present
he
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
getting
transportation
fortunately
they
found
almost
at
once
a
nice
little
yacht
with
speedy
lines
and
a
tall
mast
the
craft
must
have
belonged
to
a
wealthy
man
for
a
watchman
sat
close
to
it
before
a
little
fire
just
outside
his
shed
green
walked
up
to
him
and
when
the
fellow
rose
his
hand
suspiciously
resting
upon
his
spear
green
struck
him
on
the
jaw
then
followed
with
a
hard
right
to
the
pit
of
his
stomach
grizquetr
completed
the
job
by
hitting
him
over
the
head
with
a
length
of
pipe
he
picked
up
off
the
ground
green
emptied
the
handbag
of
the
watchman
and
was
pleased
to
see
several
coins
of
respectable
denominations
probably
his
he
said
i
hate
to
rob
him
but
we
have
to
have
money
grizquetr
do
you
remember
those
slaves
who
were
drinking
and
gambling
outside
the
striped
ape
inn
run
to
them
and
offer
them
six
if
they
tow
us
out
of
the
tell
them
we
paying
them
so
much
because
it
so
late
at
night
and
also
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
grinning
the
boy
ran
off
green
hauled
the
limp
body
of
the
unconscious
watchman
behind
the
hut
bound
and
gagged
him
and
threw
a
tarpaulin
over
him
grizquetr
returned
leading
six
noisy
and
reeling
men
sturdily
built
with
legs
and
backs
from
hauling
at
first
green
thought
he
ought
to
try
to
make
them
keep
quiet
then
decided
that
it
would
look
more
natural
if
he
let
them
talk
as
loudly
as
they
wished
there
was
a
festive
air
over
the
city
tonight
and
more
than
one
yacht
was
going
out
for
a
moonlight
cruise
once
out
on
the
plain
green
threw
the
promised
money
to
the
slaves
and
cried
have
a
good
time
to
himself
he
muttered
because
tomorrow
may
be
your
last
day
already
he
had
a
presentiment
of
what
might
happen
if
he
succeeded
in
tonight
work
there
was
no
telling
what
forces
he
might
be
unloosing
as
he
said
to
the
boy
there
were
demons
imprisoned
in
the
bowels
of
the
island
of
shimdoog
just
before
dawn
the
yacht
coasted
to
a
stop
outside
the
high
stone
walls
of
the
north
side
of
the
island
of
shimdoog
green
had
dropped
the
sail
and
judging
his
speed
exactly
had
steered
the
craft
until
its
side
was
almost
scraping
the
wall
as
soon
as
the
roller
stopped
green
put
lady
luck
in
a
bag
tied
to
his
belt
and
cautioned
her
to
keep
quiet
then
he
began
climbing
up
the
rungs
nailed
to
the
mast
the
boy
followed
him
and
both
crawled
out
upon
the
spar
green
tied
one
end
of
a
long
rope
around
the
end
of
the
spar
then
he
let
himself
down
on
it
to
the
ground
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
after
the
boy
had
also
descended
they
paused
for
a
moment
crouched
ready
to
run
at
the
first
sign
they
been
seen
but
there
was
no
outcry
the
big
moon
though
dropping
to
the
horizon
was
bright
enough
for
them
to
make
good
progress
green
led
the
way
up
a
series
of
hills
heading
in
a
circuitous
fashion
toward
the
highest
twice
he
had
to
stop
and
warn
grizquetr
about
the
towers
ahead
where
sentries
were
stationed
lady
luck
seemed
to
know
she
should
be
silent
her
eyes
glowed
and
her
teeth
flashed
but
she
was
only
making
a
soundless
snarl
they
saw
the
fires
of
the
guards
and
heard
their
muttered
voices
but
none
saw
them
it
was
doubtful
that
the
sentinels
ever
did
look
out
for
they
did
not
think
that
any
man
in
his
right
senses
would
be
roaming
about
in
the
darkness
where
it
was
well
known
that
ghosts
and
demons
waited
for
foolish
mortals
just
before
they
began
climbing
the
slope
of
the
peak
that
was
their
goal
green
whispered
this
island
is
built
much
like
the
first
one
we
encountered
i
think
that
all
of
these
islands
are
more
or
less
similar
all
being
composed
of
a
base
of
a
mile
and
a
half
square
of
eternum
metal
or
something
like
eternum
and
all
covered
with
rock
and
dirt
and
trees
and
vegetation
and
stocked
with
birds
and
beasts
i
suppose
that
the
original
builders
landscaped
these
craft
for
aesthetic
reasons
after
all
a
sheet
of
metal
with
a
few
metal
chambers
on
it
does
look
very
pretty
and
would
make
a
blinding
glare
in
the
sunshine
uh
replied
the
boy
who
did
understand
do
you
know
it
strange
that
i
was
right
the
first
time
when
i
sarcastically
referred
to
the
roaming
islands
as
glorified
what
yes
in
the
beginning
there
must
have
been
many
more
than
there
are
now
enough
to
keep
the
vast
plains
looking
neat
and
the
grass
clipped
the
forests
prevented
from
encroaching
limits
and
so
on
but
when
there
were
no
longer
any
maintenance
men
to
keep
them
going
they
stopped
one
by
one
until
at
this
present
time
there
are
perhaps
a
few
hundred
though
i
do
know
there
may
be
more
anyway
whenever
one
did
run
down
or
break
down
for
some
reason
or
other
it
was
soon
erased
by
a
island
erased
yes
for
it
quite
obvious
to
me
that
the
islands
not
only
cut
grass
they
kept
the
plains
free
of
obstructions
that
were
supposed
to
be
there
and
a
dead
island
would
constitute
just
such
a
hazard
grizquetr
spoke
in
a
thin
voice
perhaps
father
i
may
yet
understand
you
i
must
be
stupid
far
from
it
you
learn
in
time
anyway
i
should
have
known
what
they
really
were
when
i
heard
the
tales
of
the
sailors
remember
that
one
about
the
big
hole
made
by
the
meteorite
and
how
something
mysterious
filled
it
in
and
covered
it
with
turf
and
then
there
was
the
way
that
wrecked
would
vanish
down
to
the
last
nut
and
bolt
and
the
skeletons
of
the
dead
aboard
and
there
was
the
legend
of
samdroo
the
tailor
turned
sailor
and
what
he
found
in
the
metal
chambers
inside
an
island
the
great
white
eye
through
which
he
saw
what
was
outside
the
island
and
the
other
paraphernalia
they
the
property
of
a
wicked
magician
as
the
tale
would
have
it
any
earthman
would
recognize
tv
and
radar
and
dials
and
controls
tell
me
more
i
will
when
we
get
over
this
wall
green
had
stopped
before
a
barrier
of
stone
reaching
at
least
forty
feet
high
a
grim
crown
it
completely
encircled
the
top
of
the
hill
once
it
must
have
been
difficult
to
scale
but
mortar
has
crumbled
here
and
there
and
vines
grow
all
the
way
up
follow
me
i
remember
exactly
the
path
i
took
he
jumped
up
on
a
little
ledge
seized
a
thick
vine
and
hauled
himself
up
to
another
minor
projection
unhesitatingly
the
boy
swarmed
up
after
him
panting
they
reached
the
top
where
they
rested
a
moment
and
wiped
the
blood
from
their
lacerated
fingertips
the
cat
was
the
only
one
that
seemed
unperturbed
silently
green
pointed
out
the
twenty
foot
high
statue
of
the
fish
goddess
below
her
back
turned
to
them
as
she
gestured
at
the
cave
mouth
with
the
charm
for
the
first
time
grizquetr
seemed
scared
like
all
his
fellows
he
had
an
unhealthy
awe
for
the
supernatural
this
place
so
walled
off
so
utterly
so
invested
with
all
the
attributes
of
taboo
so
invocative
of
the
horrible
tales
of
demons
and
angry
gods
depressed
him
only
his
father
seeming
indifference
to
any
fiends
they
might
encounter
kept
him
from
turning
tail
and
backing
down
the
wall
one
thing
i
bet
and
that
is
that
miran
did
follow
me
this
far
but
stayed
down
on
the
ground
with
that
belly
of
his
he
never
have
made
it
he
have
tumbled
off
like
a
big
fat
bug
and
been
squashed
like
one
too
would
that
have
been
awful
however
he
did
have
to
go
all
the
way
with
me
the
very
fact
that
i
would
dare
to
enter
a
taboo
area
is
enough
to
condemn
me
i
should
have
slit
his
throat
when
amra
told
me
he
been
shadowing
me
but
i
could
do
it
without
absolutely
convincing
evidence
and
even
if
i
had
that
i
suppose
too
civilized
to
kill
him
in
cold
blood
you
should
have
told
me
how
you
felt
said
grizquetr
i
would
have
slipped
a
dagger
through
the
tallow
over
his
ribs
no
doubt
and
so
would
your
mother
well
down
we
go
and
he
set
the
example
by
throwing
his
leg
over
the
edge
of
the
wall
and
letting
himself
down
somewhat
gingerly
the
descent
was
even
worse
than
the
ascent
but
he
did
bother
telling
the
boy
that
by
the
time
he
found
out
he
be
at
the
bottom
even
so
when
he
reached
ground
he
thought
that
the
lad
could
be
one
whit
more
shaky
than
he
forty
feet
was
a
long
long
way
when
you
were
up
on
top
looking
down
especially
in
the
moonlight
this
is
the
second
time
i
done
it
but
i
do
think
i
have
guts
enough
for
a
third
time
said
green
but
we
have
to
climb
back
out
do
we
oh
we
have
to
go
over
it
but
i
hope
it
wo
be
so
high
by
then
said
green
looking
mysterious
what
do
you
mean
well
i
hope
those
stones
will
all
be
tumbled
to
the
ground
in
fact
it
a
necessity
if
we
to
do
what
i
expect
to
do
he
took
the
bewildered
boy
by
the
hand
and
led
him
past
the
cold
and
silent
statue
and
into
the
cave
entrance
we
could
use
a
light
he
said
but
a
torch
would
have
been
too
awkward
to
carry
up
that
wall
and
we
can
grope
our
way
to
the
rooms
that
are
lighted
wonder
why
the
passageway
was
lighted
too
he
thought
or
had
this
cave
been
added
by
the
savages
who
used
to
live
on
the
island
so
that
the
would
have
to
be
approached
through
darkness
perhaps
it
was
the
primitives
having
constructed
such
a
chamber
so
that
the
initiate
into
the
religion
could
go
through
darkness
both
literal
and
symbolical
and
come
into
a
light
that
also
embraced
both
worlds
he
did
and
could
know
he
could
only
guess
but
i
can
take
advantage
of
what
i
do
have
on
hand
he
said
to
himself
gritting
his
teeth
with
determination
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
gave
way
to
clean
metal
they
rounded
a
corner
and
found
themselves
in
a
chamber
much
like
the
one
upon
their
first
island
except
that
this
had
furniture
a
skeleton
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
face
down
the
back
of
the
skull
exhibited
a
great
hole
he
may
have
been
here
for
a
thousand
years
or
more
said
green
like
to
know
his
story
but
i
never
will
do
you
think
the
goddess
killed
him
no
nor
the
demons
either
it
was
the
hand
of
man
struck
him
down
my
boy
if
it
violent
death
you
trying
to
explain
do
drag
in
the
supernatural
there
enough
murder
in
the
hearts
of
humankind
to
take
care
of
every
case
in
the
third
room
green
said
there
no
wall
of
dust
to
stop
us
the
ionic
charges
have
stopped
working
notice
how
clean
everything
is
ah
here
we
are
before
the
door
grizquetr
looked
puzzled
door
i
see
only
a
blank
wall
that
all
i
saw
too
said
green
and
that
is
all
i
would
ever
have
seen
if
it
had
been
for
the
tale
of
samdroo
let
me
tell
you
how
you
got
in
chattered
the
boy
excitedly
i
know
what
you
were
thinking
of
what
you
did
you
stood
before
the
wall
and
you
made
a
sign
like
this
on
it
he
traced
a
rough
outline
of
a
rocket
against
the
cool
white
metal
and
the
wall
suddenly
slid
to
one
side
and
you
had
an
entrance
see
a
whole
section
had
moved
noiselessly
into
the
wall
leaving
a
round
doorway
yes
i
remembered
the
story
of
samdroo
and
though
it
was
ridiculous
to
think
that
it
would
work
i
did
what
the
sailor
did
remember
that
the
cannibals
were
after
him
and
he
ran
into
the
cave
and
came
to
just
such
a
blank
wall
and
he
wishing
to
protect
himself
against
the
evil
spirits
that
he
was
sure
lived
in
the
cave
traced
the
sign
that
is
supposed
to
prevent
them
from
touching
a
man
and
the
door
slid
open
and
he
plunged
on
into
the
chambers
of
the
wicked
magician
the
savages
howling
frustratedly
after
him
and
continued
green
i
did
just
what
he
did
and
the
sign
proved
to
be
an
o
for
me
a
what
never
mind
the
point
is
that
the
ancient
maintenance
men
must
have
used
just
such
a
gesture
to
open
the
door
or
else
used
it
in
conjunction
with
other
means
and
if
they
did
then
they
must
also
have
been
repair
technicians
for
the
ships
that
landed
here
perhaps
the
sign
of
the
rocket
was
a
secret
symbol
for
their
guild
i
do
know
but
it
sounds
reasonable
ignoring
the
boy
flood
of
questions
he
walked
into
a
great
room
it
was
more
bare
than
he
expected
when
he
had
found
it
the
first
time
it
contained
four
machines
or
their
fuel
supplies
all
concealed
in
four
large
square
metal
containers
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
chair
and
an
instrument
panel
the
panel
contained
six
tv
windows
several
oscilloscopes
and
dials
whose
purpose
he
did
know
but
the
controls
attached
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
seemed
simple
enough
the
only
trouble
he
said
is
that
i
do
know
where
the
activating
switch
is
i
tried
to
find
it
the
other
night
and
could
yet
it
must
be
so
obvious
that
i
feel
like
a
fool
when
i
do
locate
it
vainly
he
pulled
at
the
little
levers
set
in
the
arms
my
failure
to
activate
this
was
the
main
reason
i
returned
to
the
yacht
and
sailed
on
to
estorya
of
course
i
had
to
go
and
find
out
just
what
the
situation
was
and
get
a
good
idea
of
my
plan
of
campaign
perhaps
if
i
stayed
here
and
taken
a
chance
on
going
into
the
city
blind
we
have
been
better
off
at
least
your
mother
would
now
be
in
prison
and
we
would
have
the
additional
worry
of
rescuing
her
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
began
pacing
back
and
forth
how
ironic
if
i
come
this
far
and
could
get
no
farther
but
then
what
else
could
i
expect
it
up
to
me
to
solve
this
and
i
not
infallible
omniscient
it
should
be
functioning
as
of
now
i
know
that
the
ring
of
has
got
it
paralyzed
so
it
ca
act
nevertheless
unless
it
blown
a
fuse
gone
neurotic
from
frustration
or
just
worn
out
there
should
be
some
indication
that
it
is
still
in
operation
what
do
you
mean
said
grizquetr
how
can
the
island
be
paralyzed
green
stopped
pacing
to
gesture
at
the
radarscopes
see
those
well
there
should
be
some
funny
lines
squiggling
across
it
or
little
dots
moving
or
arcs
sweeping
across
it
they
would
be
indicating
the
shapes
of
things
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
outside
the
island
and
the
lay
of
the
land
thus
i
imagine
that
in
the
ancient
days
when
it
spotted
a
rocket
shape
which
would
then
have
been
a
genuine
spaceship
and
not
a
mockup
it
would
have
detoured
around
it
the
whole
island
was
in
one
of
its
functions
a
field
attendant
a
scavenger
it
removed
anything
from
the
plain
that
was
supposed
to
be
there
there
why
they
now
attack
and
crush
them
and
disintegrate
the
parts
that
fall
beneath
their
bases
that
also
explains
why
the
island
is
trapped
by
a
ring
of
towers
the
radar
detects
a
complete
circle
and
being
unable
to
molest
any
object
shaped
like
a
rocket
it
squats
in
one
place
until
it
runs
down
or
the
rocket
shapes
are
removed
of
course
it
worked
automatically
but
there
were
controls
for
a
man
to
operate
it
when
there
was
a
special
job
to
do
or
if
he
had
to
take
it
to
another
place
it
ordinarily
would
go
when
on
automatic
these
controls
must
be
the
ones
the
question
is
does
the
island
switch
itself
off
and
on
at
certain
intervals
scanning
the
area
around
it
to
see
if
the
inhibiting
objects
have
gone
if
so
there
no
telling
how
long
we
may
have
to
wait
before
its
next
sweep
and
we
just
ca
afford
to
wait
he
was
in
agony
as
long
as
he
could
keep
his
body
and
brain
in
action
he
felt
he
was
progressing
but
as
soon
as
he
had
to
wait
upon
some
inanimate
object
that
he
could
attack
or
came
across
a
seemingly
unsolvable
problem
he
was
lost
he
just
did
have
the
patience
lady
luck
whined
she
was
tired
of
being
imprisoned
in
the
bag
at
green
waist
and
felt
that
she
had
been
a
good
girl
long
enough
absently
he
lifted
her
out
and
put
her
on
the
table
she
stretched
yawned
licked
her
lips
and
then
padded
across
the
table
her
tail
switched
back
and
forth
and
its
tip
brushed
the
surface
of
the
centrally
located
tv
screen
immediately
a
metal
ball
on
the
panel
glowed
red
and
a
sharp
whistle
sounded
two
seconds
later
light
sprang
into
being
in
all
of
the
viewers
oh
you
beauty
you
doll
you
lovely
lady
luck
whatever
would
i
do
without
you
shouted
green
he
started
forward
to
caress
the
cat
but
alarmed
she
jumped
from
the
table
and
sped
across
the
room
come
back
come
back
he
called
i
would
hurt
a
single
one
of
your
lovely
black
hairs
i
feed
you
on
beer
and
fish
the
rest
of
your
life
and
you
never
have
to
put
in
a
day
work
what
the
matter
said
grizquetr
green
hugged
him
then
sat
down
in
the
chair
nothing
except
that
that
wonderful
cat
showed
me
how
to
activate
the
equipment
you
do
so
by
brushing
your
hand
across
this
screen
see
i
bet
you
do
the
same
when
you
want
to
it
he
touched
the
screen
the
whistle
sounded
again
the
metal
ball
ceased
glowing
and
the
screens
went
dead
once
again
he
touched
it
and
life
came
back
nothing
to
it
but
chances
are
i
never
have
found
out
how
simple
it
was
he
began
sobering
up
down
to
work
let
see
the
six
tv
windows
showed
them
the
north
east
south
west
above
and
below
as
the
island
was
resting
upon
solid
dirt
there
was
of
course
nothing
to
see
beneath
we
remedy
that
but
first
i
think
we
better
see
if
these
screens
give
expanding
and
contracting
views
he
fiddled
around
with
the
levers
when
he
depressed
the
second
one
the
room
jumped
hastily
replacing
it
in
neutral
green
said
well
we
know
what
that
one
does
i
bet
the
people
outside
think
they
had
a
slight
earthquake
they
seen
nothing
yet
hmmm
here
i
think
is
the
one
i
want
he
twisted
a
knob
on
the
arm
all
the
tv
began
narrowing
their
field
of
vision
reversing
the
knob
however
made
them
spread
out
their
view
though
the
objects
in
them
of
course
became
smaller
it
took
him
five
minutes
more
of
cautious
testing
before
he
felt
justified
in
beginning
operations
then
he
raised
the
island
off
the
ground
about
twenty
feet
and
rocked
it
back
and
forth
lady
luck
leaped
for
his
lap
and
cowered
down
in
it
grizquetr
bracing
himself
against
the
table
turned
pale
relax
kid
called
green
as
long
as
you
going
along
on
the
ride
you
might
as
well
enjoy
it
grizquetr
grinned
feebly
but
when
his
father
told
him
to
stand
behind
him
so
he
too
could
learn
how
to
operate
he
gained
color
and
confidence
when
we
get
to
estorya
i
may
have
to
leave
this
chamber
and
i
need
somebody
who
can
see
me
through
the
tv
and
answer
my
signals
the
candidate
you
may
be
only
a
kid
but
anybody
who
can
calmly
talk
of
slipping
a
knife
through
a
man
ribs
has
what
it
takes
thank
you
breathed
grizquetr
in
all
sincerity
here
what
i
do
said
green
i
roll
this
island
back
and
forth
until
the
soldiers
are
thoroughly
panicky
and
seasick
and
the
walls
around
the
cave
are
tumbled
down
then
we
lower
to
earth
again
and
give
the
rats
a
chance
to
desert
the
ship
but
we
no
sinking
ship
not
us
after
everybody
that
able
has
fled
to
the
plains
take
off
at
top
speed
for
estorya
fascinated
the
boy
watched
the
screens
and
saw
the
soldiers
run
off
into
the
early
morning
light
yelling
their
eyes
and
mouths
bulging
with
horror
some
wounded
crawled
off
i
feel
sorry
for
them
said
green
but
somebody
got
to
get
hurt
before
this
is
over
and
i
rather
it
was
us
he
pointed
to
the
which
still
indicated
the
ring
of
towers
as
long
as
this
island
was
on
automatic
it
could
pass
those
inhibitories
but
i
that
with
this
switch
now
we
go
ahead
and
not
over
the
towers
as
we
could
easily
do
but
through
them
i
think
we
got
the
weight
behind
us
there
was
a
slight
shock
the
rooms
trembled
then
the
towers
before
them
were
gone
and
they
were
speeding
across
the
plain
minute
by
minute
green
increased
their
rate
until
he
thought
they
must
be
making
about
a
hundred
and
miles
an
hour
those
dials
are
probably
telling
me
my
speed
he
said
to
grizquetr
but
i
ca
read
their
alphabet
or
numerical
system
it
matter
he
laughed
as
he
watched
wheel
hard
aport
or
hard
to
starboard
in
a
frenzy
to
get
out
of
their
way
the
rails
and
ratlines
were
lined
with
white
faces
like
rags
of
terror
fluttering
in
the
breeze
of
the
island
passage
if
there
were
time
to
send
a
message
i
imagine
we
encounter
the
whole
estoryan
fleet
said
green
what
a
battle
that
would
be
rather
what
a
massacre
for
this
craft
is
built
for
eating
up
whole
navies
father
said
grizquetr
we
could
be
king
over
the
whole
world
we
could
rule
the
xurdimur
and
take
tribute
off
every
that
sailed
yes
i
suppose
we
could
you
little
barbarian
you
replied
green
but
we
wo
we
using
this
for
just
one
purpose
rescuing
the
earthman
and
your
mother
and
sisters
after
that
yes
i
do
know
he
fell
into
a
reverie
as
the
plain
beneath
raced
past
the
white
sails
of
the
blooming
from
small
patches
to
great
flags
then
dwindling
as
swiftly
finally
rousing
from
his
thoughts
he
began
to
explain
a
little
to
the
boy
you
see
many
thousands
of
years
ago
there
was
a
great
civilization
that
had
many
machines
that
would
seem
to
you
even
more
magical
than
this
one
they
traveled
to
the
stars
and
there
found
worlds
much
like
this
one
and
they
put
colonies
upon
them
they
had
swift
ships
that
could
jump
across
the
vast
abyss
between
these
worlds
and
so
keep
in
fairly
close
touch
but
something
happened
some
catastrophe
i
ca
imagine
what
it
could
be
but
it
must
have
happened
while
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
the
cause
all
we
can
know
is
the
effect
travel
ceased
and
as
time
went
by
the
colonies
which
were
probably
rather
small
to
begin
with
lost
their
civilization
the
colonies
must
have
been
rather
dependent
upon
supplies
shipped
to
them
and
they
must
have
had
a
limited
number
of
highly
trained
scientists
and
specialists
among
them
anyway
whatever
the
reason
they
relapsed
into
savagery
and
it
was
not
until
ages
had
passed
that
some
of
these
colonies
utterly
without
memory
of
their
glorious
heritage
except
perhaps
disguised
in
myth
and
legend
attained
a
high
technology
again
others
stayed
in
savagery
some
like
your
world
grizquetr
are
in
the
transition
stage
your
culture
is
roughly
analogous
to
the
ones
that
existed
on
earth
between
and
those
dates
mean
nothing
to
you
i
know
but
let
me
assure
you
that
we
terrestrials
regard
those
times
as
being
well
rather
hazardous
and
uh
unreasonable
in
their
conduct
i
only
you
replied
the
boy
but
did
you
say
that
nothing
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
survived
on
your
planet
well
why
had
it
done
so
on
ours
these
islands
must
be
the
work
of
the
old
ones
correct
and
that
not
all
so
is
the
xurdimur
itself
what
yes
it
obvious
to
me
that
this
planet
must
once
have
been
a
tremendous
and
landing
field
for
spacecraft
these
plains
could
be
natural
they
must
have
been
leveled
out
by
machinery
a
grass
was
planted
that
had
all
the
characteristics
needed
to
hold
the
soil
together
and
keep
erosion
away
plus
the
fact
that
the
islands
themselves
were
you
might
say
caretakers
and
kept
the
whole
field
spruced
up
gods
i
can
imagine
what
a
traffic
this
planet
must
have
had
to
build
such
a
ten
thousand
miles
across
the
mind
boggles
before
the
thought
they
must
have
done
things
on
a
big
scale
then
which
makes
it
all
the
more
difficult
to
figure
out
how
they
could
have
come
to
ruin
will
we
ever
know
what
force
wrecked
them
grizquetr
of
course
had
even
less
of
an
answer
than
green
both
were
silent
for
a
while
then
they
cried
out
simultaneously
when
the
pointed
tips
of
the
white
towers
surrounding
estorya
glittered
upon
the
horizon
one
of
the
screens
began
flashing
a
series
of
cone
shapes
that
indicated
the
towers
if
the
island
were
still
on
automatic
it
would
be
forced
to
go
around
the
entire
nation
said
green
but
i
running
it
now
and
paying
no
attention
to
those
towers
knock
down
that
just
what
i
intend
to
do
but
not
right
now
let
see
wonder
how
high
we
can
go
only
one
way
to
find
out
upsydaisy
he
pulled
back
the
lever
and
the
island
began
rising
though
still
maintaining
its
horizontal
attitude
the
ancients
like
us
moderns
knew
how
to
build
machines
and
they
also
must
have
kept
building
their
spaceships
in
the
conventional
long
after
there
was
any
need
for
it
perhaps
though
they
did
so
in
order
for
the
islands
to
have
a
more
definite
radar
image
maybe
no
one
really
knows
he
spoke
to
himself
meanwhile
glancing
at
the
screen
which
showed
him
the
plains
and
the
city
of
estorya
beneath
as
their
height
increased
do
me
a
favor
grizquetr
run
out
to
the
cave
mouth
and
tell
me
if
those
walls
have
fallen
over
and
on
your
way
back
close
the
door
to
this
room
it
going
to
get
colder
very
quickly
and
the
air
will
be
thin
but
i
imagine
that
this
room
is
equipped
with
automatic
heat
and
oxygen
if
it
is
i
want
to
find
out
now
the
boy
began
running
back
the
walls
are
all
shaken
down
all
right
he
said
breathlessly
and
the
fish
goddess
fell
over
and
her
head
almost
blocks
up
the
cave
mouth
i
wriggled
through
without
any
trouble
i
think
you
can
squeeze
through
green
felt
a
little
sick
that
possibility
had
not
occurred
to
him
it
would
have
been
ironic
if
the
statue
had
completely
blocked
the
entrance
and
he
had
to
stay
inside
until
he
starved
to
death
the
estoryans
of
course
would
have
considered
his
death
a
case
of
poetical
justice
no
he
would
have
died
either
he
just
have
gone
back
to
the
controls
and
rolled
the
island
over
on
one
side
until
the
statue
head
came
loose
but
what
if
the
big
stone
blocks
from
the
tumbled
wall
had
fallen
down
behind
the
statue
so
that
they
wedged
her
too
tightly
to
be
released
he
sweated
at
the
thought
and
glanced
fondly
at
the
black
cat
he
was
superstitious
not
at
all
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
luck
had
been
better
since
she
adopted
him
of
course
that
was
the
scientific
attitude
to
take
nevertheless
he
felt
comforted
just
knowing
she
was
around
by
now
the
whole
nation
of
estorya
could
be
encompassed
in
one
glance
and
the
sky
was
getting
darker
we
high
enough
he
stopped
the
island
if
anybody
did
get
off
he
must
be
dead
by
now
the
air
so
thin
and
i
was
right
we
do
have
automatic
heat
and
very
comfortable
in
here
i
only
wish
we
had
something
to
eat
why
not
lower
us
to
the
height
where
i
can
go
out
and
find
food
in
the
garrison
kitchens
said
grizquetr
nobody
be
alive
to
stop
me
green
thought
that
was
an
excellent
suggestion
he
was
very
hungry
for
he
always
had
to
eat
for
two
himself
and
the
vigilante
if
the
symbiote
within
his
body
provided
him
with
more
than
normal
strength
and
powers
it
also
demanded
fuel
on
which
to
operate
and
deprived
of
food
it
would
survive
by
living
upon
green
tissue
a
vigilante
was
all
advantage
it
had
its
dangers
he
lowered
the
island
to
about
two
thousand
feet
set
the
controls
on
neutral
then
decided
that
it
would
be
safe
to
go
out
with
the
boy
just
as
he
got
to
the
doorway
however
he
began
feeling
uneasy
and
wondering
what
he
would
do
if
somehow
the
door
closed
and
he
get
it
open
again
that
would
be
a
fine
situation
to
be
stuck
two
thousand
feet
in
the
air
and
no
parachute
perhaps
he
was
silly
absurdly
apprehensive
but
he
was
going
to
take
any
more
chances
grinning
sheepishly
he
told
the
boy
to
go
on
by
himself
he
decided
to
study
the
controls
more
closely
and
think
out
his
strategy
in
finer
detail
when
grizquetr
returned
with
a
basket
loaded
with
food
and
wine
green
swore
at
himself
for
his
moment
weakness
then
forgot
it
after
all
discretion
was
the
better
part
and
all
that
and
he
was
only
playing
it
smart
greedily
he
devoured
the
food
and
drank
half
a
bottle
of
wine
knowing
the
vigilante
would
use
alcohol
before
food
and
that
little
of
it
would
remain
in
his
bloodstream
before
being
consumed
between
bites
he
told
grizquetr
what
he
planned
we
descend
as
soon
as
we
finished
eating
i
write
a
note
and
you
drop
it
over
the
side
upon
the
steps
of
the
palace
the
note
will
inform
the
king
he
better
release
his
prisoners
unharmed
just
outside
the
windbreak
there
we
may
easily
pick
them
up
and
then
take
off
like
the
proverbial
big
bird
if
he
refuses
we
will
proceed
to
lower
the
island
upon
the
temple
of
the
fish
goddess
crushing
it
and
her
golden
idol
and
if
he
still
is
convinced
then
smash
the
palace
not
to
mention
toppling
over
the
entire
ring
of
towers
around
the
country
of
course
before
we
drop
the
note
knock
over
a
few
anyway
just
to
show
him
we
not
bluffing
grizquetr
eyes
shone
can
the
island
crush
a
big
building
yes
though
i
think
that
there
a
possibility
we
could
as
easily
disintegrate
it
i
wondered
how
the
island
cut
the
grass
and
can
only
conclude
that
it
must
use
a
device
similar
to
one
we
have
on
earth
it
cuts
through
objects
by
breaking
up
their
atomic
structure
with
a
beam
that
is
only
a
when
on
duty
the
island
must
emit
such
a
beam
and
only
beneath
its
base
of
course
it
must
have
other
machines
too
for
cleaning
up
wreckage
and
debris
and
other
stuff
that
its
memory
banks
tell
it
has
no
business
being
on
the
field
but
i
do
know
how
to
operate
these
grizquetr
looked
reproachfully
at
green
well
i
do
know
everything
i
not
a
superman
am
i
the
boy
did
not
reply
but
his
expression
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
had
thought
his
was
just
that
green
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
sent
the
boy
out
to
get
paper
pen
and
ink
from
the
garrison
by
the
time
the
boy
returned
green
had
lowered
the
island
to
about
fifty
feet
above
the
palace
he
hastily
wrote
a
note
put
it
in
the
basket
which
had
a
cover
that
could
be
snapped
shut
and
told
grizquetr
to
throw
it
over
the
side
aiming
at
the
steps
i
know
you
going
to
be
worn
out
with
all
this
running
back
and
forth
he
said
but
you
can
do
it
you
big
and
strong
sure
i
am
said
the
boy
chest
expanded
he
dashed
from
the
room
almost
tripped
going
through
the
door
recovered
and
disappeared
grinning
green
began
to
watch
the
crowds
that
had
gathered
below
presently
he
saw
the
basket
hurtle
toward
a
group
of
priests
upon
the
great
stairway
his
grin
broadened
when
the
group
disintegrated
in
panic
and
several
of
them
lost
their
footing
and
rolled
down
the
steps
he
waited
until
one
of
them
got
enough
courage
to
return
and
open
the
basket
then
he
lowered
the
island
another
twenty
feet
at
the
same
time
he
saw
a
cannon
being
hauled
into
the
square
before
the
palace
and
its
nose
being
raised
so
that
it
could
fire
upon
him
have
to
give
the
beggars
credit
for
guts
he
murmured
or
for
sheer
folly
i
do
know
which
well
fire
away
friends
they
did
because
a
priest
came
running
to
stop
them
evidently
his
note
though
written
in
huinggro
had
been
translated
swiftly
enough
and
the
estoryans
were
taking
no
hasty
action
while
we
waiting
for
them
to
make
up
their
minds
we
give
them
a
taste
of
the
feast
they
can
expect
if
they
are
reasonable
green
said
he
then
proceeded
to
push
over
about
twenty
towers
just
outside
the
windbreak
it
was
great
fun
and
he
have
liked
to
knock
down
a
hundred
or
so
more
but
he
was
too
anxious
to
find
out
about
amra
and
the
earthman
he
returned
to
his
former
vigil
above
the
palace
steps
impatiently
he
waited
for
ten
minutes
that
seemed
like
ten
hours
finally
when
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
he
growled
i
going
to
squat
on
the
roof
of
the
temple
and
make
them
hurry
up
do
they
think
this
is
a
diplomatic
conference
or
something
that
they
can
dillydally
about
like
this
no
father
said
grizquetr
there
they
come
mother
and
paxi
and
soon
and
inzax
and
a
strange
man
he
must
be
the
demon
demon
your
horned
hoof
snorted
green
that
man
as
human
as
i
am
and
the
poor
fellow
must
have
gone
through
hell
even
from
this
height
i
can
see
he
looks
bad
look
how
he
has
to
be
supported
between
two
soldiers
amra
and
the
others
he
was
happy
to
note
seemed
to
be
unharmed
nevertheless
he
was
anxious
about
them
during
their
ride
through
the
city
streets
and
out
to
the
windbreak
the
estoryans
might
have
plans
for
a
sudden
attack
though
he
did
see
how
they
could
expect
to
surprise
him
since
from
his
vantage
point
he
would
notice
any
concentration
of
troops
immediately
or
a
fanatical
priest
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
kill
them
neither
of
these
possibilities
happened
the
prisoners
were
released
outside
the
fallen
towers
and
the
soldiers
retreated
into
the
city
grizquetr
left
the
control
room
to
guide
them
onto
the
island
in
fifteen
minutes
he
ran
back
here
they
are
father
saved
now
get
off
the
ground
before
the
estoryans
change
their
minds
we
going
back
replied
green
looking
in
vain
for
the
others
and
then
deciding
that
the
boy
had
outstripped
them
in
his
haste
to
report
he
shoved
the
lever
forward
and
the
ship
he
was
beginning
to
think
of
the
island
as
a
ship
soared
toward
the
cone
of
the
spacecraft
which
he
could
see
glittering
in
the
sun
inside
its
wall
near
the
palace
when
amra
and
the
girls
ran
into
the
chamber
and
wished
to
throw
their
arms
around
him
he
told
them
he
be
very
glad
to
give
each
a
big
warm
kiss
later
on
right
now
he
had
work
to
do
amra
smile
was
replaced
by
a
frown
do
you
mean
you
still
thinking
of
leaving
on
the
demon
ship
she
said
harshly
that
depends
on
certain
factors
about
which
i
do
have
enough
information
as
yet
to
act
on
he
replied
somewhat
stiffly
the
earthman
limped
in
he
was
a
tall
but
emaciated
man
his
bushy
beard
made
his
long
lean
face
resemble
lincoln
captain
walzer
of
the
terrestrial
interstellar
fleet
intelligence
he
said
weakly
alan
green
marine
food
specialist
i
a
long
story
to
tell
and
no
time
to
tell
it
i
would
like
to
know
if
you
can
pilot
that
spacer
and
if
it
in
operating
condition
otherwise
we
might
as
well
forget
it
and
go
elsewhere
yes
i
the
pilot
hassan
was
the
navigator
and
communications
officer
poor
devil
he
died
in
agony
those
beasts
i
know
how
you
feel
but
we
no
time
to
go
into
that
is
the
ship
ready
to
take
off
walzer
sat
down
and
leaned
his
head
wearily
to
one
side
grizquetr
offered
him
wine
and
he
took
two
long
swallows
and
smacked
his
lips
before
replying
ah
that
the
first
drink
i
had
for
two
years
yes
the
ready
to
take
off
on
a
moment
notice
we
been
on
a
mission
whose
purpose
i
ca
tell
you
security
you
know
we
were
returning
when
we
encountered
this
system
since
it
part
of
our
duty
to
report
any
planet
if
we
time
we
decided
to
stop
off
and
stretch
our
legs
we
been
in
space
so
long
we
were
beginning
to
suffer
from
claustrophobia
and
were
ready
to
fly
at
each
other
throats
you
know
how
it
is
if
you
made
any
very
long
voyages
and
those
scouts
have
especially
cramped
quarters
they
not
made
for
long
trips
but
the
nature
of
our
mission
required
the
use
of
one
well
we
wo
go
into
that
anyway
we
were
wild
to
breathe
fresh
air
again
to
see
a
horizon
to
feel
grass
beneath
our
bare
feet
to
go
swimming
to
eat
freshly
killed
meat
and
freshly
picked
fruit
we
rationalized
ourselves
into
the
idea
that
it
was
our
duty
to
land
we
decided
on
this
city
because
it
was
so
conspicuous
stuck
out
here
in
the
middle
of
this
incredible
plain
and
of
course
when
we
got
close
enough
to
see
that
it
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
spaceships
we
had
to
enter
the
city
itself
and
inquire
about
this
phenomenon
we
were
greeted
friendlily
enough
lulled
into
being
off
guard
then
attacked
the
rest
of
the
story
you
know
green
nodded
and
said
here
we
are
just
above
the
ship
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
faced
the
group
but
before
we
take
any
further
steps
i
think
we
ought
to
thrash
out
something
right
now
that
has
been
bothering
amra
and
me
tell
me
walzer
is
there
enough
room
for
amra
paxi
soon
grizquetr
and
myself
and
perhaps
for
inzax
if
she
wished
to
come
along
walzer
eyes
widened
no
man
absolutely
not
there
barely
space
for
you
let
alone
anybody
else
green
held
out
his
hands
to
amra
you
see
i
was
afraid
of
this
all
the
time
i
have
to
go
without
you
he
paused
swallowed
then
said
but
i
return
i
swear
i
will
get
the
interstellar
archaeology
bureau
interested
in
this
planet
when
i
tell
them
of
the
xurdimur
of
the
towers
of
the
islands
with
their
machines
they
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
organizing
an
expedition
the
chance
of
solving
the
mystery
of
how
man
spread
all
over
the
galaxy
in
prehistoric
times
will
be
too
strong
for
them
and
i
come
back
with
them
and
i
make
this
planet
my
life
work
i
a
in
ichthyology
and
i
can
get
accredited
as
a
scientific
member
of
the
expedition
there
no
doubt
about
it
amra
fell
into
his
arms
weeping
crying
that
she
had
known
all
the
time
that
he
could
leave
her
then
in
the
next
breath
she
was
swearing
that
he
was
just
promising
to
return
so
he
would
avoid
a
scene
i
know
men
well
alan
green
and
i
know
you
especially
you
come
back
yes
i
will
i
swear
it
if
you
know
men
so
well
you
ought
to
know
that
no
man
who
is
worthy
of
being
called
a
man
could
even
think
of
leaving
a
woman
like
you
she
smiled
through
her
tears
and
said
that
what
i
wanted
to
hear
you
say
but
oh
alan
it
be
so
long
wo
it
take
at
least
two
years
yes
at
least
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
worry
about
you
while
gone
or
i
would
if
i
did
know
how
capable
you
were
i
can
learn
how
to
run
this
island
she
said
by
the
time
you
get
back
i
probably
be
queen
of
the
xurdimur
i
could
contact
the
vings
and
together
we
could
have
the
whole
plain
and
every
city
along
its
border
under
our
thumbs
and
he
laughed
and
said
that
was
what
i
was
afraid
of
turning
to
walzer
he
said
look
you
too
weak
to
consider
another
long
trip
immediately
why
do
you
just
follow
this
island
in
your
ship
until
we
get
to
a
safe
distance
from
here
say
about
a
thousand
miles
due
north
we
live
on
the
island
until
you
get
your
strength
back
and
get
over
your
claustrophobia
i
imagine
it
was
helped
any
by
being
cooped
up
in
that
dungeon
when
you
ready
we
take
off
in
the
meantime
i
can
be
showing
amra
and
grizquetr
just
what
can
be
done
with
the
island
she
can
be
living
on
it
while
i
gone
trap
wild
life
to
replace
the
animals
that
were
strangled
when
i
went
up
too
high
for
them
to
breathe
she
can
shuttle
back
and
forth
over
the
xurdimur
or
over
the
whole
planet
if
she
wishes
and
she
will
i
hope
stay
out
of
mischief
until
i
get
back
that
fine
said
walzer
i
get
in
the
ship
and
follow
you
three
weeks
later
the
two
earthmen
boarded
the
scout
and
closed
the
port
behind
them
the
port
that
would
not
open
again
until
they
were
on
earth
some
four
months
subjective
time
away
they
sat
down
in
the
control
cabin
and
walzer
began
pushing
buttons
and
throwing
switches
green
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
the
tears
from
his
eyes
and
said
whew
a
fine
woman
said
walzer
sympathetically
a
rare
beauty
she
has
a
tremendous
impact
upon
one
something
like
crashing
into
a
planet
said
green
she
has
the
faculty
of
wringing
out
every
last
bit
of
energy
left
in
the
particular
emotion
she
happens
to
be
feeling
at
the
moment
a
great
actress
who
believes
in
her
roles
her
children
are
fine
children
too
walzer
added
slowly
and
as
if
he
were
about
to
say
something
that
might
hurt
green
feelings
but
was
anxious
not
to
do
so
you
will
be
glad
to
see
them
again
of
course
of
course
after
all
paxi
my
daughter
i
love
the
others
as
if
they
were
also
mine
ah
breathed
walzer
then
you
going
back
to
her
green
did
express
surprise
or
anger
because
he
had
guessed
from
walzer
actions
just
what
he
was
thinking
you
ca
imagine
my
wanting
to
live
on
that
barbaric
planet
with
that
woman
can
you
he
said
evenly
that
after
all
there
are
serious
gaps
in
our
ways
of
thinking
in
our
behavior
in
our
education
that
what
you
meant
by
your
statement
walzer
glanced
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
green
then
replied
warily
well
yes
but
you
know
what
you
want
far
better
than
i
do
he
paused
then
added
i
must
say
i
admire
your
courage
green
shrugged
after
all
i
been
through
i
not
afraid
to
take
one
more

i
julian

i
a

i
read
about
every

of
history
you
can

only
one
makes
sense
the
one
which
assumes
that
every
historical
event
is
aimed
personally
at
my

wife
and
an

of
characters
one

martian
or

it
all
suppose
you
held
in

proof
of
the
biggest
science
story
of
the
century
