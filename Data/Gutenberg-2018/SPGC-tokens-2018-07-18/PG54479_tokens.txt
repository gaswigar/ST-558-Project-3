the
islands
of
the
south
seas
are
places
of
an
interest
curiously
limited
the
ethnological
problem
presented
by
the
native
is
interesting
only
to
men
of
science
commerce
is
negligible
there
is
little
real
agriculture
and
no
industry
at
all
there
remains
the
charm
of
living
among
people
whose
outlook
upon
life
is
basically
different
from
our
own
of
living
with
a
simplicity
foreign
to
anything
in
one
s
experience
amid
surroundings
of
a
beauty
unreal
both
in
actuality
and
in
retrospect
it
is
impossible
to
write
of
the
islands
as
one
would
write
of
france
or
mexico
or
accepted
viewpoint
of
the
traveler
is
not
applicable
here
a
simple
attempt
to
impart
information
would
prove
singularly
monotonous
and
one
is
driven
to
essay
a
different
task
to
pry
into
the
life
of
the
mingling
races
hoping
to
catch
something
of
its
significance
and
atmosphere
in
making
such
an
attempt
it
is
necessary
at
times
to
dig
deeper
than
would
be
consistent
with
good
taste
if
names
were
mentioned
and
for
this
the
case
of
certain
small
ancient
polynesian
names
have
been
used
instead
of
those
given
on
the

lands
of
the
south
leisurely
i
don
t
remember
precisely
when
it
was
that
nordhoff
and
i
first
talked
of
this
adventure
the
idea
had
grown
upon
us
one
might
say
with
the
gradual
splendor
of
a
tropical
sunrise
we
were
far
removed
from
the
tropics
at
that
time
we
were
in
fact
in
paris
and
had
behind
us
the
greatest
adventure
we
shall
ever
know
on
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
along
the
stood
rank
on
rank
of
german
cannon
silent
enough
now
but
still
menacing
their
muzzles
tilted
skyward
at
that
ominous
slant
one
came
to
know
so
well
for
a
month
we
had
seen
them
so
children
perched
astride
them
on
sunny
afternoons
rolling
pebbles
down
their
smooth
black
throats
veterans
in
soiled
and
faded
horizon
blue
with
the
joy
of
this
new
quiet
world
bright
on
their
faces
opening
examining
mechanism
with
the
skill
of
long
use
at
such
employment
with
a
kind
of
wondering
hesitation
in
their
movements
too
as
though
at
any
moment
they
expected
those
sinister
monsters
in
the
fantastic
colors
of
harlequin
to
spring
into
life
again
those
were
glorious
days
never
again
i
think
will
there
be
such
a
happy
time
as
that
in
paris
the
boulevards
were
crowded
the
tables
filled
under
every
awning
in
front
of
the
cafés
and
yet
there
seemed
to
be
a
deep
silence
everywhere
a
silence
intensified
by
the
faint
rustling
of
autumn
leaves
and
the
tramping
of
innumerable
feet
one
heard
the
sound
of
voices
of
laughter
of
singing
the
subdued
continuous
rumble
of
traffic
but
not
a
harsh
cry
not
a
discordant
note
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
making
holiday
at
the
passing
of
a
solemn
happy
festival
well
we
had
kept
it
with
the
and
have
the
memory
of
it
now
to
be
enjoyed
over
and
over
again
as
the
years
pass
but
there
was
danger
that
we
might
outstay
the
freshness
of
that
period
we
were
anxious
to
avoid
that
for
the
sake
of
our
memories
if
for
nothing
else
while
we
were
not
yet
free
to
order
our
movements
as
we
chose
we
pretended
that
we
were
and
so
one
rainy
evening
in
the
december
following
the
armistice
we
decided
to
call
that
chapter
of
experience
closed
and
to
go
forward
with
the
making
of
new
plans
for
we
meant
to
have
further
adventure
of
one
kind
or
in
the
sense
of
unexpected
incident
rather
than
of
hazardous
activity
that
had
been
a
settled
thing
between
us
for
a
long
time
we
had
no
craving
for
excitement
but
turned
to
plans
for
uneventful
wanderings
which
we
had
sketched
in
broad
outlines
months
before
they
had
been
left
of
necessity
vague
but
now
that
any
of
them
might
be
made
realities
now
that
we
had
leisure
and
a
reasonable
hope
for
the
fulfillment
of
we
had
cause
for
a
contentment
which
was
something
deeper
than
happiness
the
best
of
it
was
that
the
close
of
the
war
found
us
with
nothing
to
prevent
our
doing
pretty
much
as
we
chose
we
might
have
had
houses
or
lands
to
anchor
us
or
promising
careers
to
drag
us
back
into
the
bewilderments
of
modern
civilization
but
fortunately
or
unfortunately
there
were
none
of
these
things
the
chance
of
war
had
given
us
a
freedom
far
beyond
anyone
s
desert
we
had
some
misgivings
about
accepting
so
splendid
a
gift
which
the
event
sometimes
proves
to
be
the
most
doubtful
of
benefits
viewed
in
the
light
of
our
longings
however
our
capacity
for
it
seemed
incalculable
and
so
by
degrees
we
allowed
our
minds
to
turn
to
an
old
south
pacific
it
became
irresistible
the
more
we
talked
of
it
longing
as
we
then
were
for
the
solitude
of
islands
the
objection
to
this
choice
was
that
the
groups
of
islands
which
we
meant
to
visit
have
been
endowed
with
an
atmosphere
of
pseudoromance
displeasing
to
the
fastidious
mind
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
our
being
pioneers
wherever
we
might
go
we
could
not
hope
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
old
explorers
who
first
came
upon
those
places
we
must
expect
great
changes
but
much
as
we
might
regret
for
the
purposes
of
this
adventure
that
we
had
not
been
born
two
hundred
years
earlier
comfort
was
not
wanting
to
our
situation
had
we
been
contemporaries
and
with
de
quiros
or
cook
or
bougainville
we
should
have
missed
the
great
war
we
came
within
view
of
tahiti
one
windless
february
a
view
as
pedro
fernandez
de
quiros
himself
must
have
had
more
than
three
hundred
years
before
the
sky
to
the
west
was
still
bright
with
stars
and
but
barely
touched
with
the
very
ghost
of
light
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
great
water
with
a
few
clouds
like
islands
immeasurably
distant
half
an
hour
later
the
islands
themselves
lay
in
full
sunlight
jagged
peaks
falling
away
in
steep
ridges
to
the
sea
against
sheer
walls
still
in
shadow
in
upland
valleys
one
could
see
a
few
terns
but
there
was
no
other
movement
no
sound
nor
any
sign
of
a
human
to
shatter
the
illusion
of
primitive
loveliness
it
was
illusion
of
course
but
the
reality
was
nothing
like
so
disappointing
as
i
had
feared
it
would
be
outwardly
two
hundred
years
of
progress
have
wrought
no
great
amount
of
havoc
there
is
a
little
port
a
busy
place
on
boat
days
but
when
the
steamer
has
emptied
the
town
of
her
passengers
the
silence
flows
down
again
from
the
hills
off
the
main
thoroughfare
streets
lie
empty
to
the
eye
for
half
hours
at
a
time
chinese
merchants
sit
at
the
doorways
of
their
shops
waiting
for
trade
now
and
then
broad
pools
of
sunlight
flow
over
the
gayly
flowered
dresses
of
a
group
of
native
women
scarcely
to
be
seen
otherwise
as
they
move
slowly
through
tunnels
of
moist
green
gloom
or
a
small
schooner
like
a
detail
gifted
with
sudden
mobility
in
a
picture
will
back
away
from
shore
cross
the
harbor
bright
with
the
reflections
of
clouds
and
stand
out
to
sea
in
the
stillness
of
the
noon
siesta
one
hears
at
infrequent
intervals
the
resounding
thud
of
ripe
fruits
as
they
tear
their
way
to
the
ground
through
barriers
of
foliage
and
at
night
the
melancholy
thunder
of
the
surf
on
the
reef
outside
the
harbor
and
the
slithering
of
bare
feet
in
the
moonlit
streets
coming
from
a
populous
exile
doubly
attracted
for
that
reason
by
the
lure
of
unpeopled
places
nordhoff
and
i
sought
here
an
indication
of
what
we
might
find
later
elsewhere
the
few
thousands
of
natives
whites
orientals
live
in
a
charmed
circle
of
low
land
fronting
the
sea
conscious
of
their
mountains
no
doubt
but
the
whites
without
curiosity
the
orientals
without
desire
the
natives
without
remembrance
there
must
have
been
a
maze
of
trails
in
the
old
days
leading
down
from
the
rich
valleys
now
they
are
overgrown
untraveled
lost
since
the
old
life
is
no
more
than
a
memory
one
is
glad
for
the
desolation
and
grateful
to
the
french
lack
of
enterprise
which
surely
is
the
only
way
to
account
for
it
no
we
couldn
t
have
chosen
a
better
place
for
our
unpremeditated
wanderings
we
had
the
whole
expanse
of
the
pacific
before
us
or
better
around
us
and
there
was
as
i
have
said
a
harbor
full
of
shipping
boats
with
pleasing
names
like
the
the
the
the
the
seagoing
aspect
some
tidy
and
smart
with
new
paint
and
rigging
others
with
decks
warped
and
sides
blistered
bottoms
foul
with
the
accumulation
of
a
six
months
cruise
reeking
with
the
warm
odor
of
copra
boats
newly
arrived
from
remote
islands
with
crowds
of
natives
on
their
decks
their
eyes
beaming
with
pleasure
in
anticipation
of
the
delights
of
the
great
capital
to
the
marquesas
the
australs
the
cooks
the
low
archipelago
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
the
middle
of
the
hurricane
season
among
these
latter
there
was
one
whose
name
was
like
a
friendly
hail
from
gloucester
or
portland
maine
but
it
was
not
this
which
attracted
me
to
her
for
all
its
assurance
of
yankee
hospitality
she
was
off
to
the
paumotus
the
cloud
of
islands
and
a
longing
to
go
there
persisted
in
the
face
of
a
number
of
vague
discouragements
there
were
no
practical
difficulties
easy
enough
to
get
passage
by
one
schooner
or
another
paumotu
copra
is
famous
throughout
the
southern
pacific
there
is
a
good
deal
of
competition
for
it
boats
racing
one
another
for
cargo
to
the
richer
islands
the
discouragements
weren
t
so
vague
either
now
that
i
think
of
them
they
came
from
men
kindly
disposed
interested
in
the
islands
in
their
own
way
but
their
concerns
were
purely
commercial
i
heard
a
deal
of
talk
about
kilos
in
tons
in
shiploads
its
market
value
in
papeete
in
san
francisco
in
marseilles
until
the
stately
trees
which
gave
it
lost
for
a
time
their
old
significance
talk
too
of
coconut
oil
and
its
richness
in
there
was
a
word
to
bring
one
back
to
a
workaday
world
to
meet
it
at
the
outset
of
a
journey
was
disheartening
it
followed
me
with
the
shrill
insistence
of
a
creamery
whistle
and
i
came
very
near
giving
up
my
plans
altogether
nordhoff
did
change
his
he
said
that
it
was
silly
no
doubt
but
he
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
wandering
however
lonely
in
a
cloud
of
islands
therefore
we
said
having
arranged
for
a
rendezvous
at
a
distant
date
and
set
out
on
diverging
paths
i
ought
to
leave
crichton
the
english
planter
out
of
this
story
altogether
he
doesn
t
belong
in
a
commonplace
record
of
travel
such
as
this
one
set
out
to
be
he
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
voyage
of
the
among
the
atolls
but
when
i
think
of
that
vessel
he
comes
inevitably
into
mind
i
see
him
sitting
on
the
cabin
deck
with
his
freckled
brown
hands
clasped
about
his
knees
looking
across
a
solitude
of
waters
and
in
my
mental
concept
of
the
low
archipelago
he
is
always
somewhere
in
the
background
standing
on
the
reef
of
a
tiny
atoll
his
back
to
the
sea
almost
as
much
a
part
of
the
lonely
picture
as
the
sea
itself
but
one
can
t
be
wholly
matter
of
fact
in
writing
of
these
islands
they
are
not
real
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
belong
rather
to
the
realm
of
the
imagination
and
it
is
only
in
the
imagination
that
you
can
conceive
of
your
ever
having
been
there
once
you
are
back
again
in
a
sea
track
as
for
the
people
whether
native
or
alien
in
order
to
focus
them
in
a
world
of
reality
it
is
necessary
to
remember
what
they
said
or
did
what
they
ate
what
sort
of
clothing
they
wore
otherwise
they
elude
you
just
as
the
islands
do
this
point
of
view
isn
t
perhaps
commonly
held
among
the
few
white
men
who
know
of
small
schooners
managers
of
trading
companies
resident
agents
whose
interest
as
i
have
said
is
in
what
they
produce
rather
than
in
what
they
are
as
one
old
skipper
of
my
acquaintance
put
it
in
speaking
of
the
atolls
take
them
by
and
large
they
are
as
much
alike
as
the
on
that
sail
findlay
s
pacific
a
supposedly
competent
authority
bears
him
out
in
this
they
are
all
of
similar
character
adding
for
emphasis
no
doubt
and
they
exhibit
very
great
sameness
in
their
features
he
does
however
make
certain
slight
concessions
to
what
may
be
his
own
private
conception
of
their
peculiar
fascination
this
vast
collection
of
coral
islands
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
pacific
and
later
in
his
account
of
them
the
native
name
paumotu
signifies
a
cloud
of
islands
an
expressive
term
but
he
doesn
t
forget
that
he
is
writing
for
mariners
who
want
facts
and
not
fancies
however
truthful
these
may
be
to
reality
now
there
s
tikehau
one
of
them
said
to
me
before
i
had
been
out
there
that
s
a
round
atoll
and
rahiroa
is
sort
o
square
like
an
so
on
some
with
passes
and
a
good
anchorage
inside
the
lagoon
others
you
got
to
lay
outside
an
take
your
cargo
off
the
reef
in
a
small
boat
but
to
go
back
to
crichton
no
one
knew
who
he
was
or
where
he
came
from
the
manager
of
the
trading
company
had
lived
in
papeete
for
years
and
had
never
seen
him
until
the
day
when
he
turned
up
at
the
water
front
trundling
a
wheelbarrow
loaded
with
four
crates
of
chickens
and
an
odd
lot
of
plantation
tools
and
fishing
tackle
following
him
were
two
native
boys
carrying
a
sea
chest
and
an
old
woman
with
an
enormous
roll
of
bedding
tied
loosely
in
a
pandanus
mat
that
was
about
an
hour
before
the
schooner
weighed
anchor
he
stacked
his
gear
neatly
on
the
beach
and
then
went
on
board
asking
for
passage
to
tanao
no
sir
the
manager
said
in
telling
about
it
afterward
i
never
laid
eyes
on
him
until
that
moment
and
i
don
t
know
anyone
who
had
where
s
he
been
hiding
himself
and
why
in
the
name
of
common
sense
does
he
want
to
go
to
tanao
there
s
no
copra
or
pearl
shell
enough
anyway
to
make
it
worth
a
man
s
while
going
after
it
tino
the
supercargo
was
equally
puzzled
i
know
tanao
from
the
sea
he
said
passed
it
once
coming
down
from
the
marquesas
when
i
was
supercargo
of
the
we
were
blown
out
of
our
course
by
a
young
hurricane
didn
t
land
there
s
no
one
on
the
place
now
here
s
this
englishman
or
dane
or
he
to
be
set
down
there
with
four
crates
of
chickens
and
an
old
kanaka
woman
for
company
he
shook
his
head
with
a
expression
adding
a
moment
later
well
you
meet
some
queer
people
down
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
don
t
believe
in
asking
them
their
business
but
it
beats
me
sometimes
trying
to
figure
out
what
their
business
is
he
was
not
able
to
figure
it
out
in
this
case
the
old
woman
was
talkative
but
the
information
he
gathered
from
her
only
stimulated
his
curiosity
the
more
she
owned
tanao
an
atom
of
an
atoll
miles
out
of
the
beaten
track
even
of
the
paumotu
schooners
there
had
never
been
more
than
a
score
of
people
living
on
it
she
said
and
now
there
was
no
one
crichton
had
taken
a
long
lease
on
it
and
was
going
out
he
told
me
to
do
my
writing
and
thinking
undisturbed
i
didn
t
know
this
until
later
however
when
i
first
heard
him
spoken
of
we
were
only
a
few
hours
out
from
papeete
we
had
left
the
harbor
with
a
light
breeze
but
at
four
in
the
afternoon
the
schooner
was
lying
about
fifteen
miles
offshore
lazy
jacks
flapping
against
idle
sails
with
a
mellow
crusty
sound
after
a
good
deal
of
fretting
at
the
fickleness
of
land
breezes
talk
had
turned
to
crichton
who
was
up
forward
somewhere
looking
after
his
chickens
i
didn
t
pay
much
attention
then
to
what
was
being
said
for
i
had
just
had
one
of
those
moments
which
come
rarely
enough
in
a
lifetime
but
which
make
up
for
all
the
arid
stretches
of
experience
they
give
no
forewarning
there
comes
a
flood
of
happiness
which
brings
tears
to
the
eyes
the
sense
of
it
is
so
keen
the
sad
part
of
it
is
that
one
refuses
to
accept
it
as
a
moment
you
say
by
jove
i
m
not
going
to
let
this
pass
and
it
has
gone
as
unaccountably
as
it
came
half
lost
through
foreboding
of
its
end
one
prepares
for
it
unknowingly
i
suppose
through
months
sometimes
years
of
longing
for
something
remote
and
as
these
islands
for
example
and
when
you
have
your
islands
the
moment
comes
sooner
or
later
and
you
see
them
in
the
light
which
never
was
as
the
saying
goes
but
which
is
the
light
of
truth
for
all
that
brief
as
it
is
no
one
can
say
that
the
reward
isn
t
ample
and
it
leaves
an
afterglow
in
the
memory
tempering
regret
fading
very
slowly
which
one
never
wholly
loses
since
it
takes
on
the
color
of
memory
itself
becoming
a
part
of
that
dim
world
of
illusions
all
of
which
has
very
little
to
do
with
what
was
passing
aboard
the
except
that
i
was
prevented
from
taking
an
immediate
interest
in
my
fellow
passengers
but
this
being
my
first
near
view
of
a
polynesian
trading
schooner
the
scene
on
deck
had
all
the
charm
of
the
unusual
our
skipper
was
a
paumotuan
a
former
pearl
diver
and
the
of
them
including
the
boys
in
addition
to
these
there
were
crichton
the
planter
the
supercargo
master
of
three
major
languages
and
half
a
dozen
polynesian
dialects
the
manager
of
the
trading
company
william
the
engineer
oro
the
cabin
boy
a
chinese
cook
and
two
chinese
of
the
leisurely
persistent
oriental
invasion
of
french
polynesia
thirty
native
passengers
a
horse
in
an
improvised
stall
amidships
a
monkey
perched
in
the
mainmast
rigging
crichton
s
four
crates
of
chickens
and
five
pigs
in
addition
to
the
passengers
and
live
stock
we
were
carrying
out
a
cargo
of
lumber
corrugated
iron
flour
rice
sugar
canned
goods
clothing
and
dry
goods
each
of
the
native
passengers
brought
with
him
as
much
dunnage
as
an
englishman
carries
when
he
goes
traveling
and
his
food
for
the
oranges
bananas
breadfruit
mangoes
canned
meat
with
all
of
this
a
two
months
supply
of
gasoline
for
the
engines
and
fresh
water
and
green
coconuts
for
both
passengers
and
crew
we
made
a
snug
fit
even
the
space
under
the
patient
little
native
horse
was
used
to
stow
his
fodder
for
the
long
journey
the
women
with
one
exception
were
barefooted
bareheaded
but
otherwise
conventionally
dressed
according
to
european
or
american
standards
this
i
suppose
is
an
outrageous
betrayal
of
a
trade
secret
if
one
may
say
that
writers
of
south
sea
narratives
belong
to
a
trade
those
seriously
interested
in
the
islands
have
of
course
known
the
truth
about
them
for
years
but
i
believe
it
is
still
a
popular
misconception
that
the
women
who
inhabit
one
seems
to
be
interested
in
the
even
to
this
day
creatures
who
display
their
charms
to
the
general
gaze
with
naïve
indifference
they
may
still
be
but
not
in
the
old
sense
there
are
a
few
to
be
sure
who
by
means
of
the
bribes
or
the
entreaties
of
itinerant
journalists
and
photographers
may
be
persuaded
to
disrobe
before
the
camera
for
a
moment
s
space
and
in
this
way
the
primitive
legend
is
preserved
to
the
outside
world
but
as
i
told
nordhoff
although
we
are
itinerant
we
may
as
well
be
occasionally
truthful
and
so
gain
perhaps
a
certain
amount
of
begrudged
credit
the
one
exception
was
a
girl
of
about
nineteen
she
came
on
board
balancing
unsteadily
on
high
french
heels
her
brown
legs
darkening
the
sheen
of
her
stockings
i
had
seen
her
the
day
before
as
she
passed
below
the
veranda
of
le
cercle
bougainville
the
everyman
s
club
of
the
port
she
walked
with
the
same
air
of
precarious
balance
and
her
straw
hat
was
set
at
the
jaunty
angle
american
women
affect
l
indigène
d
aujourd
my
french
companion
said
then
breaking
into
english
the
old
polynesia
is
dead
yes
one
may
say
that
it
is
quite
quite
dead
a
memory
he
called
it
je
vous
assure
monsieur
ce
n
est
rien
que
he
rang
changes
on
the
word
in
a
soft
voice
with
an
air
of
enforced
liveliness
i
was
rather
saddened
at
the
time
picturing
in
my
mind
the
scene
on
the
shore
of
that
bright
lagoon
two
hundred
years
ago
before
any
of
these
people
had
been
forced
to
accept
the
blessings
of
an
alien
civilization
but
the
girl
with
the
french
heels
wasn
t
a
good
illustration
of
indigène
d
aujourd
even
in
the
matter
of
surface
changes
most
of
the
women
dress
much
more
simply
and
sensibly
and
it
was
amusing
as
well
as
comforting
to
see
how
quickly
she
got
rid
of
her
unaccustomed
clothing
once
we
had
left
the
harbor
she
disappeared
behind
a
row
of
water
casks
and
came
out
a
moment
later
in
a
dress
of
material
barefooted
and
bareheaded
like
the
rest
of
them
she
had
a
single
hibiscus
flower
in
her
hair
which
hung
in
a
loose
braid
i
don
t
believe
she
had
ever
worn
shoes
before
at
any
rate
as
she
sat
on
a
box
husking
a
coconut
with
her
teeth
i
could
see
her
ankle
calluses
glinting
in
the
sun
like
disks
of
polished
metal
there
was
another
girl
sitting
on
the
deck
not
far
from
me
with
an
illustrated
supplement
of
an
american
paper
spread
out
before
her
it
was
an
ancient
copy
there
were
pictures
of
battlefields
in
france
of
soldiers
marching
down
fifth
avenue
a
tennis
tournament
at
longwood
aeroplanes
in
flight
motor
races
at
indianapolis
actresses
society
women
dressmakers
models
making
a
display
of
corsets
and
other
women
s
out
of
the
welter
of
modern
life
the
little
paumotuan
girl
appeared
to
be
deeply
interested
with
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
and
her
elbows
braced
against
her
knees
she
went
from
picture
to
picture
but
looked
longest
at
those
of
the
women
who
smiled
or
posed
or
looked
disdainfully
at
her
from
the
pages
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
know
what
if
anything
was
passing
in
her
mind
all
at
once
she
gave
a
little
sigh
crumpled
the
paper
into
a
ball
and
threw
it
at
the
monkey
who
caught
it
and
began
tearing
it
in
pieces
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
at
this
called
the
attention
of
the
others
and
in
a
moment
men
women
and
children
had
gathered
round
laughing
and
shouting
throwing
bits
of
coconut
shell
mango
seeds
banana
skins
faster
than
the
monkey
could
catch
them
the
spontaneity
of
the
merriment
did
one
s
heart
good
even
the
old
men
and
women
laughed
not
in
the
indulgent
manner
of
parents
or
grandparents
but
as
heartily
as
the
children
themselves
unconscious
of
the
uproar
one
of
the
chinese
merchants
was
lying
on
a
thin
mattress
against
the
cabin
skylight
although
he
was
sound
asleep
his
teeth
were
bare
in
a
grin
of
ghastly
suavity
and
his
left
eye
was
partly
open
giving
him
an
air
of
constant
watchfulness
he
was
dreaming
i
suppose
of
copra
of
pearl
kilos
tons
shiploads
of
its
market
value
in
papeete
in
san
francisco
in
marseilles
etc
well
the
whites
get
their
share
of
these
commodities
and
the
chinamen
theirs
but
the
natives
have
a
commodity
of
laughter
which
is
vastly
more
precious
and
as
long
as
they
do
have
it
one
need
not
feel
very
sorry
for
them
dusk
gathered
rapidly
while
i
was
thinking
of
these
things
heavy
clouds
hung
over
tahiti
and
moorea
clinging
about
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
whose
peaks
rising
above
them
were
still
faintly
visible
against
the
somber
glory
of
the
sky
they
seemed
islands
of
sheer
fancy
looked
at
from
the
sea
it
would
have
been
worth
all
that
one
could
give
to
have
seen
them
then
as
de
quiros
saw
them
or
cook
or
the
early
missionaries
to
have
added
to
one
s
own
sense
of
their
majesty
the
solemn
and
more
childlike
awe
of
the
old
explorers
born
of
their
feeling
of
utter
isolation
from
their
kind
with
the
presence
of
the
unknown
on
every
hand
it
is
this
feeling
of
awe
rarely
to
be
known
by
travelers
in
these
modern
days
which
pervades
many
of
the
old
tales
of
wanderings
in
remote
places
which
one
senses
in
looking
at
old
sketches
made
from
the
decks
of
ships
of
the
shores
of
heathen
lands
the
wind
freshened
then
came
a
deluge
of
cool
water
blotting
out
the
rugged
outlines
against
the
sky
when
it
had
passed
it
was
deep
night
the
forward
deck
was
a
huddle
of
shelters
made
of
mats
and
bits
of
canvas
but
these
were
being
taken
down
now
that
the
rain
had
stopped
i
saw
an
old
woman
sitting
near
the
companionway
her
head
in
clear
relief
against
a
shaft
of
yellow
light
she
was
wet
through
and
the
mild
misfortune
broke
the
ice
between
us
if
one
may
use
a
metaphor
very
inapt
for
the
tropics
with
her
face
half
in
shadow
she
reminded
me
of
the
typical
grandmother
although
no
grandmother
of
my
acquaintance
would
have
sat
unperturbed
through
that
squall
and
indifferent
to
her
wet
clothing
afterward
she
didn
t
appear
to
mind
it
in
the
least
and
now
that
it
was
over
fished
a
paper
of
tobacco
and
a
strip
of
pandanus
leaf
out
of
the
bundle
on
which
she
was
sitting
she
rolled
a
pinch
of
tobacco
in
the
leaf
twisting
it
into
a
tight
corkscrew
and
lit
it
at
the
first
attempt
then
she
began
talking
in
a
deep
resonant
voice
and
by
a
simplicity
and
an
extraordinary
lucidity
of
gesture
conveyed
the
greater
part
of
her
meaning
even
to
an
alien
like
myself
it
was
not
alas
a
typical
accomplishment
i
have
not
since
found
others
similarly
gifted
she
was
crichton
s
landlady
the
owner
of
tanao
pupure
she
called
him
because
of
his
fair
hair
i
couldn
t
make
out
what
she
was
driving
at
for
a
little
while
i
understood
at
last
that
she
wanted
to
know
about
his
his
father
was
and
his
mother
i
suppose
she
thought
i
must
know
him
being
a
white
man
they
have
queer
ideas
of
the
size
of
our
world
he
was
young
he
must
have
people
somewhere
she
too
couldn
t
understand
his
wanting
to
go
to
tanao
and
i
gathered
from
her
perplexity
that
he
hadn
t
confided
his
purposes
to
her
to
any
extent
i
couldn
t
enlighten
her
of
course
and
at
length
realizing
this
she
wrapped
herself
in
her
mat
to
preserve
the
damp
warmth
of
her
body
and
dozed
off
to
sleep
i
went
below
for
a
blanket
and
some
dry
clothing
for
the
night
air
was
uncomfortably
cool
after
the
rain
the
cabin
floor
was
strewn
with
sleeping
forms
three
children
were
curled
up
in
a
corner
like
puppies
in
a
box
of
sawdust
little
brown
babies
lay
snugly
bedded
on
bundles
of
clothing
the
mothers
themselves
sleeping
in
the
careless
trustful
attitudes
of
children
the
light
from
a
swinging
lamp
threw
leaping
shadows
on
the
walls
flowed
smoothly
over
brown
arms
and
legs
was
caught
in
faint
gleams
in
masses
of
loose
black
hair
and
to
complete
the
picture
and
make
it
wholly
true
to
fact
cockroaches
of
the
enormous
winged
variety
ran
with
incredible
speed
over
the
oilcloth
of
the
cabin
table
or
made
sudden
flying
sallies
out
of
dark
corners
to
the
food
lockers
and
back
again
on
deck
no
one
was
awake
except
maui
at
the
wheel
there
was
very
little
unoccupied
space
but
i
found
a
strip
against
the
ventilator
where
i
could
stretch
out
at
full
length
by
that
time
the
moon
was
up
and
it
was
almost
as
light
as
day
i
was
not
at
all
sleepy
and
my
thoughts
went
forward
to
the
paumotus
the
cloud
of
islands
we
ought
to
be
making
our
first
landfall
within
hours
i
didn
t
go
beyond
that
in
anticipation
although
in
the
mind
s
eye
i
had
seen
them
for
months
first
one
island
and
then
another
i
had
pictured
them
at
dawn
rising
out
of
the
sea
against
a
far
horizon
or
at
night
under
the
wan
light
of
stars
lonely
beyond
one
s
happiest
dreams
of
isolation
unspoiled
unchanged
because
of
their
very
remoteness
well
i
was
soon
to
know
whether
or
not
they
fulfilled
my
hopeful
expectations
some
one
came
aft
walking
along
the
rail
in
his
bare
feet
it
was
oro
the
cabin
boy
who
is
taken
with
an
enviable
kind
of
madness
at
the
full
of
the
moon
he
looked
carefully
around
to
make
sure
that
everyone
was
asleep
then
stood
clasping
and
unclasping
his
hands
in
ecstasy
carrying
on
a
conversation
in
a
confidential
undertone
now
and
then
he
would
smile
and
straightway
become
serious
again
gazing
with
rapt
listening
attention
at
the
world
of
pure
light
nodding
his
head
at
intervals
in
vigorous
confirmation
of
some
occult
confidence
at
length
his
figure
receded
blurred
took
on
the
quality
of
the
moonlight
and
i
saw
him
no
more
illustration
chapter
i
tailpiece
the
cloud
of
ruau
the
old
paumotuan
woman
and
the
owner
of
tanao
was
the
last
of
her
family
there
were
relatives
by
marriage
but
none
of
them
would
consent
to
live
on
so
poor
an
atoll
and
the
original
population
never
large
had
diminished
through
death
and
migration
until
at
last
she
was
left
alone
living
in
her
memories
of
other
days
awed
by
the
companionship
of
spirits
present
to
her
in
strange
and
terrible
shapes
at
last
she
felt
that
she
could
endure
it
no
longer
but
it
was
many
months
before
the
smoke
of
one
of
her
signal
fires
was
seen
by
a
passing
schooner
she
returned
with
it
to
tahiti
and
if
she
had
been
lonely
before
she
was
tenfold
lonelier
there
so
far
from
the
graves
of
her
husband
and
children
it
was
at
this
time
that
crichton
met
her
he
had
been
living
at
tahiti
for
more
than
a
year
on
the
lookout
for
just
such
an
opportunity
as
ruau
offered
him
although
only
he
was
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
wanderings
and
had
almost
despaired
of
finding
the
place
he
had
so
long
dreamed
of
and
searched
for
during
that
period
he
had
been
moving
slowly
eastward
through
borneo
new
guinea
the
solomons
the
new
hebrides
the
tongas
the
cook
group
in
some
of
these
islands
the
climate
was
too
powerful
an
enemy
for
a
white
man
to
contend
with
in
others
there
was
no
land
available
or
they
lacked
the
solitude
he
wanted
this
latter
embarrassment
was
the
one
he
had
met
at
tahiti
the
fact
is
an
illuminating
commentary
on
his
character
most
men
would
find
exceptional
opportunities
for
seclusion
there
not
on
the
seaboard
but
in
the
mountains
in
the
valleys
winding
deeply
among
them
where
no
one
goes
from
year
s
end
to
year
s
end
even
those
leading
out
to
the
sea
are
but
little
frequented
in
their
upward
reaches
but
crichton
was
very
exacting
in
his
requirements
in
this
respect
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
make
few
or
no
of
those
lonely
spirits
without
the
ties
or
the
kindly
human
associations
which
make
life
pleasant
to
most
of
us
they
wander
the
thinly
peopled
places
of
the
earth
interested
in
a
large
way
at
what
they
see
from
afar
or
faintly
hear
but
looking
on
with
quiet
eyes
taking
no
part
being
blessed
or
cursed
by
nature
with
a
love
of
silence
of
the
unchanging
peace
of
great
solitudes
one
reads
of
them
now
and
then
in
fiction
and
if
they
live
in
fiction
it
is
because
of
men
like
crichton
their
prototypes
in
reality
seen
for
a
moment
as
they
slip
apprehensively
across
some
leading
from
the
outside
world
he
had
a
little
place
at
tahiti
a
walk
of
two
hours
and
a
quarter
he
said
from
the
government
offices
in
the
port
he
had
to
go
there
sometimes
to
attend
to
the
usual
formalities
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
knew
within
ten
seconds
the
length
of
the
journey
which
would
be
a
very
distasteful
one
to
him
i
can
imagine
his
uneasiness
at
what
he
saw
and
heard
on
those
infrequent
visits
an
renewal
of
activity
talk
of
trade
development
progress
would
startle
him
into
a
waiting
listening
attitude
returning
home
maps
and
charts
would
be
got
out
and
plans
made
against
the
day
when
it
would
be
necessary
for
him
to
move
on
he
told
me
of
his
accidental
meeting
with
ruau
as
he
called
the
old
paumotuan
woman
it
came
only
a
few
days
after
the
arrival
from
san
francisco
of
one
of
the
monthly
steamers
a
crowd
of
passengers
of
a
somehow
discovered
the
dim
trail
leading
to
his
house
they
were
much
pleased
with
it
he
said
adding
with
restraint
they
took
a
good
many
pictures
i
was
rather
annoyed
at
this
although
of
course
i
said
nothing
no
doubt
they
made
the
usual
remarks
charming
so
quaint
etc
it
was
the
last
straw
for
crichton
so
he
made
another
visit
to
the
government
offices
where
he
had
his
passport
viséed
he
meant
to
go
to
maketea
a
high
phosphate
island
which
stands
like
a
gateway
at
the
northwestern
approach
to
the
low
archipelago
the
phosphate
would
be
worked
out
in
time
and
the
place
abandoned
as
other
islands
of
that
nature
had
been
to
the
seabirds
but
on
that
same
evening
while
he
was
having
dinner
at
a
chinaman
s
shop
in
town
he
overheard
ruau
trying
to
persuade
some
of
her
relatives
to
return
with
her
to
tanao
he
knew
of
the
island
he
is
one
of
the
few
men
who
would
know
of
it
he
had
often
looked
at
it
on
his
charts
being
attracted
by
its
isolated
position
the
very
place
for
him
and
the
old
woman
he
said
when
she
learned
that
he
wanted
to
go
there
that
he
wanted
to
stay
his
his
hands
in
both
of
hers
and
held
them
crying
softly
without
saying
anything
more
the
relatives
made
some
objections
to
the
arrangement
at
first
but
the
island
being
remote
haunted
they
were
soon
persuaded
to
consent
to
a
ten
years
lease
with
the
option
of
renewal
crichton
promised
of
course
to
take
care
of
ruau
as
long
as
she
lived
and
at
her
death
to
bury
her
decently
beside
her
husband
he
proceeded
at
once
with
his
altered
plans
there
were
government
regulations
to
be
complied
with
and
these
had
taken
some
time
on
the
day
when
he
was
at
last
free
to
start
he
learned
that
the
was
about
to
sail
on
a
three
months
voyage
in
the
low
archipelago
he
had
no
time
to
ask
for
passage
beforehand
he
had
to
chance
the
possibility
of
getting
it
at
the
last
moment
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
either
the
manager
of
the
trading
company
or
the
supercargo
of
the
would
have
consented
to
carry
him
to
such
an
destination
had
they
known
his
reason
for
wanting
to
be
set
down
there
it
amuses
me
now
to
think
of
those
two
traders
men
without
a
trace
of
sentiment
going
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
off
their
course
merely
to
carry
the
least
gregarious
of
wanderers
on
the
last
leg
of
his
long
journey
to
an
ideal
solitude
it
was
their
curiosity
which
gained
him
his
end
they
believed
he
had
some
secret
purpose
some
reason
of
purely
material
in
view
they
had
both
seen
tanao
from
a
distance
and
knew
that
it
had
never
been
worth
visiting
either
for
pearl
shell
or
copra
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
miracle
they
believed
might
have
taken
place
in
the
meantime
during
the
voyage
i
often
heard
them
talking
about
the
atoll
about
conjecturing
and
always
miles
off
the
track
it
was
plain
that
he
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
their
hints
and
furtive
questionings
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
that
mere
talk
about
tanao
on
the
part
of
an
outsider
might
sully
the
purity
of
its
loneliness
he
may
have
been
a
little
selfish
in
his
attitude
but
if
that
is
a
fault
in
a
man
of
his
temperament
it
is
one
easily
forgiven
and
what
could
he
have
said
to
those
traders
it
was
much
better
to
keep
silent
and
let
them
believe
what
they
liked
it
must
not
be
thought
that
crichton
poured
out
his
confidences
to
me
like
a
schoolgirl
on
the
contrary
he
had
a
very
likable
reserve
although
a
good
half
of
it
i
should
say
was
shyness
then
too
he
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
talk
except
in
the
native
dialects
of
several
groups
of
widely
scattered
islands
in
english
he
had
a
tendency
to
prolong
his
vowels
and
to
omit
consonants
which
gave
his
speech
a
peculiar
exotic
sound
he
made
no
advances
for
some
time
neither
did
i
for
more
than
three
weeks
we
lived
together
on
shipboard
went
ashore
together
at
islands
where
we
had
put
in
for
copra
and
all
that
while
we
did
not
exchange
above
two
hundred
words
in
conversation
there
was
so
little
talk
that
i
can
remember
the
whole
of
it
almost
word
for
word
once
while
we
were
walking
on
the
outer
beach
at
raraka
an
atoll
of
inhabitants
he
said
to
me
i
wish
i
had
come
out
here
years
ago
they
appeal
to
the
imagination
don
t
you
think
all
these
islands
his
volubility
startled
me
it
was
a
shock
to
the
senses
like
the
crash
of
a
coconut
on
a
tin
roof
heard
in
the
profound
stillness
of
an
island
night
there
was
my
opportunity
to
throw
off
reserve
and
i
lost
it
through
my
surprise
i
merely
said
yes
very
much
an
hour
later
we
saw
the
captain
no
larger
than
a
penny
doll
at
the
end
of
a
long
vista
of
empty
beach
beckoning
us
to
come
back
we
went
aboard
without
having
spoken
again
it
was
an
odd
sort
of
relationship
for
two
white
men
thrown
into
close
contact
on
a
small
trading
schooner
in
the
loneliest
ocean
in
the
world
as
nordhoff
put
it
we
were
no
more
companionable
in
the
ordinary
sense
than
a
pair
of
hermit
crabs
but
the
need
for
talking
drops
away
from
men
under
such
circumstances
and
neither
of
us
found
the
long
silences
embarrassing
the
spell
of
the
islands
was
upon
us
both
i
can
understand
crichton
s
speaking
of
their
appeal
to
the
imagination
while
we
were
in
the
midst
of
them
for
our
presence
there
seemed
an
dream
more
radiant
than
any
reality
could
be
in
fact
my
only
hold
upon
reality
during
that
voyage
was
the
and
sometimes
even
that
substantial
old
vessel
suffered
sea
changes
was
metamorphosed
in
a
moment
and
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
she
was
a
boat
built
by
men
s
hands
often
as
she
lay
at
anchor
in
a
lagoon
of
dreamlike
beauty
i
paddled
out
from
shore
in
a
small
canoe
and
making
fast
under
her
stern
spent
an
afternoon
watching
the
upward
play
of
the
reflections
from
the
water
and
the
blue
shadows
underneath
rippling
out
and
vanishing
in
the
light
like
flames
of
fire
for
me
her
homely
rugged
new
england
name
was
a
pleasant
link
with
the
past
i
liked
to
read
the
print
of
it
the
word
boston
her
old
home
port
was
still
faintly
legible
through
a
coat
of
white
paint
it
brought
to
mind
old
memories
and
the
faces
of
old
friends
hard
to
visualize
in
those
surroundings
without
such
practical
help
far
below
lay
the
floor
of
the
lagoon
where
all
the
rainbows
of
the
world
have
authentic
end
the
water
was
so
clear
and
the
sunlight
streamed
through
it
with
so
little
loss
in
brightness
that
one
seemed
to
be
suspended
in
above
the
forests
of
branching
coral
the
deep
cool
valleys
and
the
wide
sandy
plains
of
that
strange
continent
crichton
i
believe
was
beyond
the
desire
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
world
he
had
left
so
many
years
before
his
experiences
there
may
have
been
bitter
ones
at
any
rate
he
never
spoke
of
them
and
i
doubt
if
he
thought
of
them
often
people
had
little
interest
for
him
not
even
those
of
the
atolls
which
we
visited
when
on
shore
i
usually
found
him
on
the
outer
beaches
away
from
the
villages
which
lie
along
the
lagoon
in
most
of
the
atolls
the
distance
from
beach
to
beach
is
only
a
few
hundred
yards
but
the
ocean
side
is
unfrequented
and
solitary
on
calm
days
when
the
tide
begins
to
ebb
the
silence
there
is
unearthly
the
wide
shore
hot
and
glaring
in
the
sun
stretches
away
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
empty
of
life
except
for
thousands
of
small
hermit
crabs
moving
into
the
shade
of
the
palms
they
snap
into
their
shells
at
your
approach
and
make
fast
the
door
as
their
houses
fall
with
a
sound
like
the
tinkling
of
hailstones
among
heaps
of
broken
coral
we
waded
along
the
shallows
at
low
tide
when
the
wind
was
onshore
and
a
heavy
surf
breaking
over
the
outer
edge
of
the
reef
we
sat
as
close
to
it
as
we
could
watching
the
seas
gathering
far
out
rising
in
sheer
walls
fringed
with
spray
which
seemed
higher
than
the
island
itself
as
they
approached
it
was
a
fascinating
reef
hidden
in
many
places
in
a
perpetual
smoke
of
mist
through
which
the
oncoming
breakers
could
be
seen
dimly
as
they
swept
forward
curled
and
fell
but
one
could
not
avoid
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
of
insecurity
thinking
of
what
had
happened
in
those
of
them
only
a
meter
or
two
above
sea
the
hurricanes
of
the
past
and
of
what
would
happen
again
at
the
coming
of
the
next
great
storm
we
made
landfalls
at
dawn
in
midafternoon
late
at
the
islands
in
aspects
of
beauty
exceeding
one
s
strangest
imaginings
we
penetrated
farther
and
farther
into
a
area
of
ocean
discharging
our
cargo
of
lumber
and
corrugated
iron
rice
and
flour
and
canned
goods
taking
on
copra
carrying
native
passengers
from
one
place
to
another
sometimes
we
were
out
of
sight
of
land
for
several
days
beating
into
head
winds
under
a
slowly
moving
pageantry
of
clouds
which
alone
gave
assurance
of
the
rotundity
of
the
earth
when
at
last
land
appeared
it
seemed
inaccessibly
remote
at
the
summit
of
a
long
slope
of
water
which
we
would
never
be
able
to
climb
sometimes
for
as
long
a
period
we
skirted
the
shore
line
of
a
single
atoll
the
water
deepening
and
shoaling
under
our
keel
in
splotches
of
vague
or
vivid
coloring
from
a
vantage
point
in
the
rigging
one
could
see
a
segment
of
a
vast
circle
of
islands
strung
at
haphazard
on
a
thread
of
reef
which
showed
a
thin
clear
line
of
changing
red
and
white
under
the
incessant
battering
of
the
surf
several
times
upon
going
ashore
we
found
the
villages
deserted
the
inhabitants
having
gone
to
distant
parts
of
the
atoll
for
the
season
in
one
village
we
came
upon
an
old
man
too
feeble
to
go
with
the
others
apparently
sitting
in
the
shade
playing
a
phonograph
he
had
but
three
records
away
to
the
forest
the
dance
of
the
nymphs
schottische
and
just
a
song
at
twilight
the
disks
were
as
old
as
the
instrument
itself
no
doubt
and
the
needles
so
badly
worn
that
one
could
barely
hear
the
music
above
the
rasping
of
the
mechanism
there
was
a
groove
on
the
vocal
record
where
the
needle
caught
and
the
singer
a
woman
with
a
high
quavery
voice
repeated
the
same
phrase
when
the
lights
are
low
over
and
over
again
i
can
still
hear
it
even
at
this
distance
of
time
and
place
and
recall
vividly
to
mind
the
silent
houses
the
wide
vacant
street
bright
with
fugitive
sunshine
the
lagoon
at
the
end
of
it
mottled
with
the
shadows
of
clouds
the
sense
of
our
remoteness
grew
upon
me
as
the
weeks
and
months
passed
once
rounding
a
point
of
land
we
came
upon
two
schooners
lying
inside
the
reef
of
a
small
atoll
one
of
them
had
left
papeete
only
a
short
while
before
her
skipper
gave
us
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
glancing
through
them
that
evening
i
heard
as
in
a
dream
the
clamor
of
the
outside
shrieking
of
whistles
the
roar
of
trains
the
strident
warnings
of
motors
but
there
was
no
reality
no
allurement
in
the
sound
i
saw
men
carrying
trivial
burdens
with
an
air
of
immense
effort
of
grotesque
scurrying
in
breathless
haste
on
useless
errands
gorging
food
without
relish
sleeping
without
refreshment
taking
their
leisure
without
enjoyment
living
without
the
knowledge
of
content
dying
without
ever
having
lived
the
pictures
which
came
to
mind
as
i
read
were
distorted
untrue
no
doubt
for
by
that
time
i
was
almost
as
much
attracted
by
the
lonely
life
of
the
islands
as
my
friend
crichton
my
old
feeling
of
restlessness
was
gone
in
its
place
had
come
a
certitude
of
happiness
a
sense
of
for
which
i
can
find
no
parallel
this
side
of
boyhood
it
was
largely
the
result
of
living
among
people
who
are
as
permanently
happy
i
believe
as
it
is
possible
for
humankind
to
be
and
the
more
remote
the
island
the
more
slender
the
thread
of
communication
with
civilization
as
we
know
it
the
happier
they
were
it
was
not
in
my
imagination
that
i
found
this
true
or
that
i
had
determined
beforehand
to
see
only
so
much
of
their
life
as
might
be
agreeable
and
pleasant
to
me
on
the
contrary
if
i
had
any
bias
at
first
it
was
on
the
other
side
disillusionment
is
a
sad
experience
and
i
had
no
desire
to
lay
myself
open
to
it
therefore
i
listened
willingly
to
the
less
favorable
stories
of
native
character
which
the
traders
and
others
who
know
them
had
to
tell
but
summed
up
dispassionately
later
in
the
light
of
my
own
observations
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
faults
of
character
of
which
they
were
accused
were
more
like
the
natural
shortcomings
of
children
in
many
respects
the
paumotuans
like
other
divisions
of
the
polynesian
family
are
children
who
have
never
grown
up
and
one
can
t
blame
them
for
a
lack
of
the
artificial
virtues
which
come
only
with
maturity
they
are
without
guile
they
have
little
of
the
shrewdness
or
craftiness
of
some
primitive
peoples
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
making
as
careful
a
judgment
of
them
as
i
could
i
have
often
noticed
how
like
children
they
are
in
their
amazing
trustfulness
their
impulsive
generosity
and
in
the
intensity
and
briefness
of
their
emotions
the
more
i
saw
of
their
life
the
more
desirable
it
seemed
that
they
might
continue
to
escape
any
serious
encroachments
of
european
or
american
civilization
they
have
no
doctors
because
illness
is
almost
unknown
in
their
islands
crime
insanity
evils
all
too
common
with
us
are
of
such
rare
occurrence
that
one
may
say
they
do
not
exist
it
may
be
said
too
without
overstatement
that
their
community
life
very
nearly
approaches
perfection
every
atoll
is
a
little
world
to
itself
with
a
population
varying
from
to
perhaps
three
hundred
inhabitants
the
chief
who
is
chosen
informally
by
the
men
serves
for
a
period
of
four
years
under
the
sanction
of
the
french
government
he
has
very
little
to
do
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
for
the
people
govern
themselves
are
without
law
when
i
first
learned
that
there
are
no
schools
throughout
the
islands
i
thought
the
french
guilty
of
criminal
neglect
but
later
i
reversed
this
opinion
alter
all
why
should
they
have
schools
no
education
of
ours
could
make
them
more
generous
more
kindly
disposed
to
one
another
more
hospitable
and
courteous
toward
strangers
happier
than
they
are
now
certainly
it
could
not
make
them
less
selfish
covetous
rapacious
for
most
of
them
are
as
innocent
of
those
vices
as
their
own
children
in
a
few
of
the
richer
more
accessible
islands
they
are
slowly
changing
in
these
respects
owing
to
the
example
set
them
by
men
of
our
own
race
in
another
fifty
years
perhaps
they
may
have
learned
to
believe
that
material
wealth
is
the
only
thing
worth
striving
for
then
will
come
pride
in
their
possessions
envy
of
those
who
have
greater
contempt
and
suspicion
for
those
who
have
less
and
so
an
end
to
their
happiness
i
had
never
before
seen
children
growing
up
in
a
state
of
nature
and
i
made
full
use
of
the
rare
opportunity
i
spent
most
of
my
time
with
them
played
on
shore
with
them
went
fishing
and
swimming
with
them
and
found
in
the
experience
something
better
than
a
renewal
of
boyhood
because
of
a
keener
sense
of
beauty
a
more
conscious
mature
appreciation
of
the
happiness
one
has
in
the
simplest
kinds
of
pleasures
sometimes
we
started
on
our
excursions
at
dawn
sometimes
we
made
them
by
moonlight
i
became
a
collector
of
shells
in
order
to
give
some
purpose
to
our
expeditions
along
the
reef
i
couldn
t
have
chosen
a
better
interest
for
they
knew
all
about
shells
where
and
when
to
find
the
best
ones
and
they
could
indulge
their
love
of
giving
to
a
limitless
extent
in
the
afternoons
we
went
swimming
in
the
lagoon
there
i
saw
them
at
their
best
and
happiest
in
an
element
as
necessary
and
familiar
to
them
as
it
is
to
their
parents
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
watch
children
at
play
in
the
water
but
those
paumotuan
youngsters
with
their
natural
grace
at
swimming
and
diving
put
one
under
an
enchantment
many
of
the
boys
had
water
glasses
and
small
spears
of
their
own
and
went
far
from
shore
catching
fish
they
lay
face
down
on
the
surface
of
the
water
swimming
easily
with
a
great
economy
of
motion
turning
their
heads
now
and
then
for
a
breath
of
air
and
when
they
saw
their
prey
they
dived
after
it
as
skillfully
as
their
fathers
do
and
with
nearly
as
much
success
seen
against
the
bright
floor
of
the
lagoon
with
swarms
of
brilliantly
colored
fish
scattering
before
them
they
seemed
doubtfully
human
the
children
of
some
forsaken
merman
rather
than
creatures
who
have
need
of
air
to
breathe
and
solid
earth
to
stand
on
if
education
is
the
suitable
preparation
for
life
the
children
of
the
atolls
have
it
at
its
best
and
happiest
without
knowing
that
it
is
education
they
are
skillful
in
the
pursuits
and
learned
in
the
interests
which
touch
their
lives
and
one
can
wish
them
no
better
fortune
than
that
they
may
remain
in
ignorance
of
those
which
do
not
their
parents
as
i
have
said
are
but
children
of
mature
stature
with
the
same
gift
of
frank
generous
laughter
the
same
delight
in
the
new
and
strange
very
little
is
required
to
amuse
them
i
had
a
mandolin
which
i
used
to
take
ashore
with
me
at
various
atolls
after
i
had
become
convinced
that
their
enjoyment
of
my
music
was
not
feigned
at
first
i
was
suspicious
for
i
had
no
illusions
about
my
virtuosity
and
even
when
i
thought
of
it
in
the
most
flattering
way
their
pleasure
seemed
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
quality
of
the
performance
but
there
was
no
doubting
the
genuineness
of
it
the
whole
village
would
assemble
to
hear
me
play
i
had
a
limited
repertoire
but
that
seemed
to
matter
very
little
they
liked
to
hear
the
same
tunes
played
over
and
over
again
i
learned
some
of
the
old
missionary
hymns
which
they
knew
from
greenland
s
icy
mountains
oh
happy
day
we
re
marching
to
zion
and
others
it
was
strange
to
find
those
songs
belonging
fortunately
to
a
bygone
period
in
english
and
american
life
living
still
in
that
remote
part
of
the
world
not
because
of
anything
universal
in
their
appeal
but
merely
because
they
had
been
carried
there
years
ago
by
representatives
of
the
missionary
societies
many
eccentric
changes
had
been
made
in
both
the
rhythm
and
melody
greatly
to
the
improvement
of
both
but
no
amount
of
changing
could
make
them
other
than
what
they
uncouth
expression
of
a
narrow
and
ugly
kind
of
religious
sentiment
i
don
t
think
the
paumotuans
care
much
for
them
either
they
always
seemed
glad
to
turn
from
them
to
their
own
songs
which
have
nothing
either
of
modern
or
missionary
feeling
a
woman
usually
began
the
singing
in
a
nasal
or
throaty
voice
which
she
modulated
in
an
extraordinary
way
immediately
other
women
joined
in
then
several
men
whose
voices
were
of
tenor
quality
followed
by
other
men
in
basses
and
barytones
chanting
in
two
or
three
tones
which
for
rhythm
and
tone
quality
were
like
the
beating
of
kettledrums
the
weird
blending
of
harmonics
was
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
heard
before
there
is
nothing
in
our
music
which
even
remotely
resembles
theirs
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
of
the
full
chorus
some
of
the
songs
make
a
strong
appeal
to
savage
instincts
the
less
resolute
of
the
early
missionaries
hearing
them
must
have
thrown
up
their
hands
in
despair
at
the
thought
of
the
long
difficult
task
of
conversion
awaiting
them
but
if
there
were
any
irresolute
missionaries
they
were
evidently
overruled
by
their
sterner
brothers
and
sisters
on
nearly
every
island
there
is
now
a
church
either
protestant
or
catholic
in
the
protestant
ones
the
native
population
practice
the
only
true
faith
largely
to
the
accompaniment
of
this
old
barbaric
music
those
unsightly
little
structures
rock
to
the
sound
of
exultant
choruses
which
ought
never
to
be
sung
withindoors
the
paumotuans
themselves
know
best
the
natural
setting
for
their
lagoon
beach
with
a
great
fire
of
coconut
husks
blazing
in
the
center
of
the
group
of
singers
i
liked
to
hear
them
from
a
distance
where
i
could
get
their
full
effect
to
look
on
from
the
schooner
lying
a
few
hundred
yards
offshore
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
would
be
gathered
within
the
circle
of
the
firelight
which
brought
their
figures
and
the
white
straight
stems
of
the
coconut
palms
into
clear
relief
against
a
background
of
deep
shadow
the
singing
continued
far
into
the
night
so
that
i
often
fell
asleep
while
listening
and
heard
the
music
dying
away
mingling
at
last
with
the
interminable
booming
of
the
surf
by
degrees
we
worked
slowly
through
the
heart
of
the
archipelago
pursuing
a
general
southeasterly
course
the
islands
becoming
more
and
more
scattered
until
we
had
before
us
an
expanse
of
ocean
almost
unbroken
to
the
coast
of
south
america
but
tanao
lay
at
the
edge
of
it
and
at
length
on
a
lowering
april
day
we
set
out
on
that
last
leg
of
our
outward
journey
the
lay
very
low
in
the
water
by
that
time
she
had
a
full
cargo
of
copra
one
hundred
tons
in
the
hold
and
twelve
sacked
on
deck
a
portion
of
the
deck
cargo
was
lost
that
same
afternoon
during
a
gale
of
wind
and
rain
which
burst
upon
us
with
fury
and
followed
us
with
a
seeming
malignity
of
intent
we
ran
before
it
far
out
of
our
course
for
three
hours
to
me
the
weight
of
air
was
something
incredible
an
unusually
vigorous
flourish
of
the
departing
hurricane
season
water
spouted
out
of
the
scuppers
in
a
continuous
stream
and
loose
articles
were
swept
clear
of
the
ship
disappearing
at
once
in
a
cloud
of
blinding
rain
there
was
a
fearful
racket
in
the
cabin
of
rolling
biscuit
tins
and
smashing
crockery
then
an
safe
broke
loose
and
started
to
imitate
victor
hugo
s
cannon
luckily
it
hadn
t
much
scope
and
no
smooth
runway
so
that
it
was
soon
brought
to
a
halt
by
ruau
the
old
paumotuan
woman
who
was
the
only
one
below
at
the
time
she
made
an
effective
barricade
of
copra
sacks
and
bedding
dodging
the
plunging
monster
with
an
agility
surprising
in
a
woman
of
sixty
but
what
i
remember
best
was
tané
a
monkey
belonging
to
one
of
the
sailors
skidding
along
the
cabin
deck
until
he
was
blown
against
the
whistle
which
rose
just
clear
of
the
forward
end
of
it
he
wrapped
arms
and
legs
around
it
in
his
terror
opening
the
valve
in
some
way
and
the
shrill
blast
rose
high
above
the
mighty
roar
of
wind
like
the
voice
of
man
lifted
with
impudence
in
defiance
of
the
mindless
anger
of
nature
the
storm
blew
itself
out
toward
sundown
and
the
night
fell
night
for
stars
to
make
one
wary
of
thought
but
the
moon
rose
about
nine
softening
the
pitiless
distances
throwing
a
veil
of
mild
light
across
the
black
voids
in
the
milky
way
seen
so
clearly
in
those
latitudes
the
schooner
was
riding
a
heavy
swell
and
burdened
as
she
was
rose
clumsily
to
it
sticking
her
nose
into
the
slope
of
every
sea
ruau
was
at
her
accustomed
place
against
the
cabin
ventilator
unmindful
of
the
showers
of
spray
maintaining
her
position
on
the
slanting
deck
with
the
skill
of
three
months
practice
the
thought
that
i
must
soon
bid
her
saddened
me
for
i
knew
there
was
small
chance
that
i
should
ever
meet
her
again
i
envied
crichton
his
opportunity
for
friendship
with
that
noble
old
woman
so
proud
of
her
race
so
true
to
her
own
beliefs
to
her
own
way
of
living
her
type
is
none
too
common
among
polynesians
in
these
days
one
gets
all
too
frequently
an
impression
of
a
consciousness
of
inferiority
on
their
part
a
sense
of
shame
because
of
their
simple
way
of
living
as
compared
with
ours
ruau
was
not
guilty
of
it
she
never
could
be
i
think
under
any
circumstances
i
learned
afterward
of
an
attempt
which
had
been
made
to
convert
her
to
christianity
during
her
stay
at
tahiti
evidently
she
had
not
been
at
all
convinced
by
the
priest
s
arguments
and
when
he
made
some
slighting
remark
about
the
ghosts
and
spirits
which
were
so
real
to
her
she
refused
to
listen
any
longer
frightened
though
she
was
of
spirits
she
was
not
willing
that
they
should
be
ridiculed
we
sighted
her
atoll
at
dawn
such
a
dawn
as
one
rarely
sees
outside
the
tropics
the
sky
was
overcast
at
a
great
height
with
a
film
of
luminous
mist
through
which
the
sun
shone
wanly
throwing
a
sheen
like
a
dust
of
gold
on
the
sea
masses
of
cloud
billowed
out
from
the
high
canopy
overhanging
a
black
fringe
of
land
which
lay
just
below
the
line
of
the
horizon
the
atoll
was
elliptical
in
shape
about
eight
miles
long
by
five
broad
there
were
seven
widely
separated
islands
on
the
circle
of
reef
and
one
small
motu
in
the
lagoon
we
came
into
the
wind
about
a
half
mile
offshore
and
put
off
in
the
whaleboat
the
sea
was
still
running
fairly
high
and
the
roar
of
the
surf
came
across
the
water
with
a
sound
as
soothing
as
the
fall
of
spring
rain
but
it
increased
in
volume
as
we
drew
in
until
the
ears
were
stunned
by
the
crash
of
tremendous
combers
which
toppled
and
fell
sheer
over
the
ledge
of
the
reef
it
was
by
far
the
most
landing
place
we
had
seen
on
the
journey
there
was
no
break
in
the
reef
only
a
few
narrow
indentations
where
the
surf
spouted
up
in
clouds
of
spray
between
the
breaking
of
one
sea
and
the
gathering
of
the
next
the
water
poured
back
over
a
jagged
wall
of
rock
bared
for
an
instant
to
an
appalling
depth
only
a
native
crew
could
have
managed
that
landing
we
rode
comber
after
comber
the
sailors
backing
on
their
oars
awaiting
the
word
of
the
boat
steerer
who
stood
with
his
feet
braced
on
the
gunwales
his
head
turned
over
his
shoulder
watching
the
following
seas
all
at
once
he
began
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
looked
back
in
time
to
see
a
wall
of
water
on
the
point
of
breaking
rising
high
above
us
it
fell
just
after
it
passed
under
us
and
we
were
carried
forward
across
the
edge
of
the
reef
through
the
inner
shallows
to
the
beach
the
two
traders
started
off
at
once
on
a
tour
of
inspection
and
we
saw
nothing
more
of
them
until
late
in
the
evening
meanwhile
i
went
with
ruau
and
crichton
across
the
island
to
the
lagoon
beach
where
her
house
was
as
in
most
of
the
atolls
the
ground
was
nearly
free
from
undergrowth
the
soil
affording
nourishment
only
to
the
trees
and
a
few
hardy
shrubs
coconuts
and
dead
fronds
were
scattered
everywhere
a
few
pigs
feeding
on
the
shoots
of
sprouted
nuts
gazed
up
with
an
odd
air
of
incredulity
of
amazement
as
we
approached
then
galloped
off
at
top
speed
and
disappeared
far
in
the
distance
ruau
stopped
when
we
were
about
halfway
across
and
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
a
bird
was
singing
somewhere
a
melodious
varied
song
like
that
of
the
hermit
thrush
i
had
heard
it
before
and
had
once
seen
the
bird
a
shy
solitary
little
thing
one
of
the
few
species
of
land
birds
found
on
the
atolls
while
we
were
standing
there
listening
to
the
faint
music
crichton
took
me
by
the
arm
he
said
nothing
and
in
a
moment
withdrew
his
hand
i
was
deeply
moved
by
that
manifestation
of
friendliness
an
unusual
one
for
him
to
make
he
had
some
unaccountable
defect
in
his
character
which
kept
him
aloof
from
any
relationship
approaching
real
intimacy
i
believe
he
was
constantly
aware
of
it
that
he
had
made
many
futile
attempts
to
overcome
it
it
may
have
been
that
which
first
set
him
on
his
wanderings
now
happily
at
an
end
it
was
plain
to
me
the
moment
we
set
foot
on
shore
that
he
would
have
to
seek
no
farther
for
asylum
tanao
is
one
of
the
undoubted
ends
of
the
earth
no
one
would
ever
disturb
him
there
he
himself
was
not
so
sure
of
this
once
i
remember
when
we
were
looking
at
the
place
on
the
chart
he
spoke
of
the
island
of
pitcairn
the
refuge
of
the
bounty
mutineers
before
the
opening
of
the
panama
canal
it
had
been
as
far
removed
from
contact
with
the
outside
world
as
an
island
could
be
now
it
lies
not
far
off
the
route
through
the
canal
to
new
zealand
and
is
visited
from
time
to
time
by
the
crews
of
tramp
steamers
and
schooners
tanao
however
is
much
farther
to
the
north
and
there
is
very
slight
possibility
that
its
empty
horizons
will
ever
be
stained
by
a
smudge
of
smoke
as
for
an
actual
visit
one
glance
at
the
reef
through
the
binoculars
would
convince
any
skipper
of
the
folly
of
the
attempt
even
our
own
crew
of
natives
skilled
at
such
hazardous
work
came
to
grief
in
their
second
passage
over
it
they
had
gone
out
to
the
schooner
for
supplies
crichton
had
few
sacks
of
flour
some
canned
goods
and
kerosene
oil
in
coming
back
the
boat
had
been
swept
broadside
against
a
ledge
of
rock
it
stuck
there
just
at
the
edge
of
the
reef
and
the
sailors
jumped
out
with
the
line
before
the
next
wave
came
capsizing
the
boat
and
carrying
it
inshore
bottom
up
all
the
supplies
were
swept
into
deep
water
by
the
backwash
and
lost
there
had
been
a
similar
accident
at
the
other
and
rice
brought
so
many
thousands
of
miles
having
been
spoiled
within
a
few
yards
of
their
destination
i
remember
the
natives
plunging
into
the
water
at
great
risk
to
themselves
to
save
a
few
sacks
of
soggy
paste
in
the
hope
that
a
little
of
the
flour
in
the
center
might
still
be
dry
and
a
chinese
storekeeper
to
whom
it
was
consigned
standing
on
the
shore
wringing
his
hands
in
dumb
grief
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
a
chinaman
make
any
display
of
emotion
and
the
sight
brought
home
to
me
a
conception
of
the
tragic
nature
of
such
accidents
to
the
inhabitants
of
those
distant
islands
crichton
took
his
own
loss
calmly
concealing
whatever
disappointment
he
may
have
felt
ruau
was
not
at
all
concerned
about
it
and
while
we
were
making
an
examination
of
the
house
went
out
on
the
lagoon
in
a
canoe
and
caught
more
than
enough
fish
for
supper
then
we
found
that
all
of
our
matches
had
been
spoiled
by
sea
water
so
we
could
make
no
fire
judging
by
the
way
crichton
brightened
up
at
his
discovery
one
would
have
thought
the
loss
a
piece
of
luck
he
set
to
work
at
once
to
make
an
apparatus
for
kindling
fire
but
before
it
was
finished
ruau
had
the
fish
cleaned
and
spread
out
on
a
coverlet
of
green
leaves
we
ate
them
raw
dipping
them
first
into
a
sauce
of
coconut
milk
and
for
dessert
had
a
salad
made
of
the
heart
of
a
tree
i
don
t
remember
ever
having
eaten
with
heartier
appetite
but
at
the
same
time
i
couldn
t
imagine
myself
enjoying
an
unrelieved
diet
of
coconuts
and
fish
for
a
period
of
ten
for
so
long
as
a
year
in
fact
crichton
however
was
used
to
it
and
ruau
had
never
known
any
other
except
during
her
three
months
stay
at
tahiti
where
she
had
eaten
strange
hot
food
which
had
not
agreed
with
her
at
all
she
said
dusk
came
on
as
we
sat
over
our
meal
ruau
sat
with
her
hands
on
her
knees
leaning
back
against
a
tree
talking
to
crichton
i
understood
nothing
of
what
she
was
saying
but
it
was
a
pleasure
merely
to
listen
to
the
music
of
her
voice
it
was
a
little
below
the
usual
register
of
women
s
voices
strong
and
clear
but
softer
even
than
those
of
the
tahitians
and
so
flexible
that
i
could
follow
every
change
in
mood
she
was
telling
crichton
of
the
tupapaku
of
her
atoll
which
she
dreaded
most
although
she
knew
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
one
of
her
own
sons
it
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
dog
with
legs
as
long
and
thick
as
the
stem
of
a
coconut
tree
and
a
body
proportionally
huge
it
could
have
picked
up
her
house
as
an
ordinary
dog
would
a
basket
once
it
had
stepped
lightly
over
it
without
offering
to
harm
her
in
any
way
her
last
son
had
been
drowned
while
fishing
by
moonlight
on
the
reef
outside
the
next
island
which
lay
about
two
miles
distant
across
the
eastern
end
of
the
lagoon
she
had
seen
the
dog
three
times
since
his
death
and
always
at
the
same
phase
of
the
moon
twice
she
had
come
upon
it
lying
at
full
length
on
the
lagoon
beach
its
enormous
head
resting
on
its
paws
she
was
so
badly
frightened
she
said
that
she
fell
to
the
ground
incapable
of
further
movement
sick
at
heart
too
at
the
thought
that
the
spirit
of
the
bravest
and
strongest
of
all
her
sons
must
appear
to
her
in
that
shape
it
was
clear
that
she
was
recognized
for
each
time
the
dog
began
beating
its
tail
on
the
ground
as
soon
as
it
saw
her
then
it
got
up
yawned
and
stretched
took
a
long
drink
of
salt
water
and
started
at
a
lope
up
the
beach
she
could
see
it
very
plainly
in
the
bright
moonlight
soon
it
broke
into
a
run
going
faster
and
faster
gathering
tremendous
speed
by
the
time
it
reached
the
other
end
of
the
island
from
there
it
made
a
flying
spring
and
she
last
saw
it
as
it
passed
high
in
air
across
the
face
of
the
moon
its
head
outstretched
its
legs
doubled
close
under
its
body
she
believed
that
it
crossed
the
gap
of
water
which
separated
the
islands
in
one
gigantic
leap
that
is
the
whole
of
the
story
as
crichton
translated
it
for
me
although
there
must
have
been
other
details
for
ruau
gave
her
account
of
it
at
great
length
her
earnestness
of
manner
was
very
convincing
and
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
of
the
realness
to
her
of
the
apparition
as
for
myself
if
i
could
have
seen
ghosts
anywhere
it
would
have
been
at
tanao
late
that
night
walking
alone
on
the
lagoon
beach
i
found
that
i
was
keeping
an
uneasy
watch
behind
me
the
distant
thunder
of
the
surf
sounded
at
times
like
a
wild
galloping
on
the
hard
sand
and
the
gentle
slapping
of
little
waves
near
by
like
the
lapping
tongue
of
the
ghostly
dog
having
its
fill
of
sea
water
we
left
tanao
with
a
fair
wind
the
following
afternoon
having
been
delayed
in
getting
away
because
of
the
damaged
whaleboat
which
had
to
be
repaired
on
shore
tino
the
supercargo
insisted
on
pushing
off
at
once
the
moment
the
work
was
finished
crichton
and
ruau
were
on
the
other
beach
at
the
time
so
that
i
had
no
opportunity
to
say
but
as
we
were
getting
under
way
i
saw
him
emerge
from
the
deep
shadow
and
stand
for
a
moment
his
hand
shading
his
eyes
looking
out
toward
the
schooner
i
waved
but
evidently
he
didn
t
see
me
for
there
was
no
response
then
he
turned
walked
slowly
up
the
beach
and
disappeared
among
the
trees
for
three
hours
i
watched
the
atoll
dwindling
and
blurring
until
at
sunset
it
was
lost
to
view
under
the
rim
of
the
southern
horizon
looking
back
across
that
space
of
empty
ocean
i
imagined
that
i
could
still
see
it
dropping
farther
and
farther
away
down
the
reverse
slope
of
a
smooth
curve
of
water
as
though
it
were
vanishing
for
all
time
beyond
the
knowledge
and
the
concern
of
men
my
first
packet
of
letters
from
nordhoff
was
brought
by
the
skipper
of
the
schooner
he
had
been
carrying
it
about
for
many
weeks
and
had
it
in
the
first
place
from
the
supercargo
of
another
vessel
met
at
rurutu
in
the
austral
group
the
envelope
tattered
and
spoke
of
its
long
journey
in
search
of
me
before
separating
at
papeete
we
had
arranged
for
a
rendezvous
but
at
that
time
we
still
possessed
american
ideas
of
punctuality
and
travel
now
we
know
something
of
the
casual
movements
of
trading
schooners
and
have
learned
to
regard
the
timely
arrival
of
a
letter
as
an
event
touching
on
the
keeping
of
a
rendezvous
a
possibility
too
remote
for
consideration
one
hears
curious
tales
in
this
part
of
the
world
of
the
outcome
of
such
temporary
as
ours
was
meant
to
seeking
their
wives
and
wives
their
husbands
families
scattered
among
these
fragments
of
land
and
striving
for
many
months
to
reunite
i
witnessed
not
long
ago
the
sequel
of
one
of
these
unsuccessful
quests
a
native
from
a
distant
group
of
islands
set
out
for
one
of
the
atolls
of
the
low
archipelago
the
home
of
his
sweetheart
arrangements
for
the
marriage
had
been
made
long
before
but
letters
had
gone
astray
and
upon
his
arrival
the
young
man
found
that
the
family
of
his
prospective
had
gone
to
another
atoll
for
the
diving
season
with
no
means
of
following
he
submitted
to
the
inevitable
and
married
another
girl
months
later
the
woman
of
his
first
choice
returned
with
her
second
choice
of
a
husband
and
the
former
lovers
met
for
the
young
man
had
not
yet
been
able
to
return
to
his
own
island
neither
made
any
question
of
the
other
s
is
too
short
and
from
the
native
point
of
view
it
is
foolish
to
spend
it
in
wanderings
which
at
the
last
may
never
fulfill
their
purpose
nevertheless
i
shall
make
a
search
for
leisurely
search
with
some
expectation
of
finding
him
our
islands
like
those
of
conrad
s
enchanted
heyst
are
bounded
by
a
circle
two
thousand
or
more
miles
across
and
it
is
likely
that
neither
of
us
will
ever
succeed
in
breaking
through
to
the
outside
indeed
there
is
an
outside
world
i
am
beginning
to
doubt
this
for
the
enchantment
is
at
work
as
for
nordhoff
his
letters
which
follow
may
speak
for
themselves
of
the
illustration
woodcut
on
the
sun
was
low
when
the
steamed
out
through
the
pass
and
headed
for
the
cook
group
six
hundred
miles
west
and
south
dark
clouds
hung
over
atea
of
maori
tradition
the
land
of
the
bright
the
level
sunlight
still
illuminated
the
hillsides
of
tahaa
the
lovely
sister
island
protected
by
the
same
great
oval
reef
far
off
to
the
north
the
peak
of
bora
bora
towered
abruptly
from
the
sea
it
was
not
yet
the
season
of
the
trades
and
the
northeast
breeze
which
followed
us
brought
a
sweltering
heat
intolerable
anywhere
but
on
deck
worthington
was
sitting
beside
lean
man
with
very
bright
blue
eyes
his
feet
were
bare
he
wore
a
singlet
trousers
of
white
drill
and
a
manihiki
plaited
of
bleached
pandanus
hat
not
to
be
bought
with
money
the
dinner
gong
sounded
i
m
not
going
down
he
remarked
too
hot
below
i
had
something
to
eat
at
uturoa
how
about
you
i
shook
my
needed
more
than
a
normal
appetite
to
drive
one
to
the
dining
saloon
banks
of
squall
cloud
shading
from
gray
to
an
unwholesome
violet
were
gathering
along
the
horizon
and
the
air
was
so
heavy
that
one
inhaled
it
with
an
effort
this
is
the
worst
month
of
the
hurricane
season
worthington
went
on
it
was
just
such
an
evening
as
this
last
year
that
the
waterspout
nearly
got
night
we
sighted
mataora
i
was
five
months
up
there
you
when
johnson
lost
the
old
i
was
pretty
well
done
up
last
year
and
when
i
heard
that
the
was
at
avarua
i
decided
to
take
a
vacation
and
go
for
a
six
weeks
cruise
with
johnson
ordinarily
he
would
have
been
laid
up
in
papeete
until
after
the
equinox
but
the
company
had
sent
for
him
to
make
a
special
trip
to
penrhyn
we
had
a
wretched
passage
succession
of
squalls
and
broiling
calms
the
schooner
was
in
bad
shape
anyway
rotten
sails
rigging
falling
to
pieces
and
six
inches
of
grass
on
her
bottom
on
a
hot
day
she
had
a
bouquet
all
her
sun
distilled
from
her
a
blend
of
cockroaches
and
mildewed
copra
that
didn
t
smell
like
a
rose
garden
on
the
thirtieth
day
the
skipper
told
me
we
were
two
hundred
miles
from
penrhyn
and
so
close
to
mataora
that
we
might
sight
the
palm
tops
i
d
heard
a
lot
about
the
place
it
has
an
english
name
on
the
chart
isolated
it
was
what
a
pleasant
crowd
the
natives
were
and
how
it
was
the
best
place
in
the
pacific
to
see
island
life
we
had
been
working
to
windward
against
a
light
northerly
breeze
but
the
wind
began
to
drop
at
noon
and
by
three
o
clock
it
was
glassy
calm
there
was
a
mass
of
clouds
moving
toward
us
from
the
west
but
the
glass
was
high
and
johnson
said
we
were
in
for
nothing
worse
than
a
squall
as
the
clouds
drew
near
i
could
see
that
they
had
a
sort
of
heart
broad
at
the
top
pointed
at
the
bottom
and
dropping
gradually
toward
the
water
there
was
something
queer
about
it
the
mate
was
pointing
and
johnson
s
kanakas
were
all
standing
up
suddenly
i
heard
a
rushing
sound
like
a
heavy
squall
passing
through
the
bush
the
point
of
the
funnel
had
touched
the
sea
three
or
four
hundred
yards
away
from
waterspout
there
wasn
t
a
breath
of
air
and
the
had
no
engine
it
was
moving
straight
for
us
so
slowly
that
i
could
watch
every
detail
of
its
formation
the
boys
slid
our
boat
overboard
the
mate
sang
out
something
about
all
hands
being
ready
to
leave
the
schooner
i
ve
heard
of
waterspouts
ever
since
i
was
a
youngster
but
i
never
expected
to
see
one
as
close
as
we
did
that
day
as
the
point
of
cloud
dropped
toward
the
sea
it
was
ragged
and
ill
defined
but
when
it
touched
the
water
and
the
noise
began
i
saw
its
shape
change
and
its
outlines
grow
hard
it
was
now
a
thin
column
four
or
five
feet
in
diameter
rising
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
before
it
swelled
in
the
form
of
a
flat
cone
to
join
the
clouds
above
curiously
enough
it
was
not
perpendicular
but
had
a
decided
sagging
curve
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
until
i
could
make
out
the
great
swirling
hole
at
its
base
and
see
the
vitreous
look
of
this
column
of
solid
water
revolving
at
amazing
speed
it
hadn
t
the
misty
edges
of
a
waterfall
the
outside
was
sharply
defined
as
the
walls
of
a
tumbler
i
wondered
what
would
happen
when
it
struck
the
the
mate
was
shouting
again
but
just
then
the
skipper
pushed
a
rifle
into
my
hands
damned
if
i
leave
the
old
hooker
he
swore
shoot
into
the
we
can
break
it
and
believe
me
or
not
we
did
break
it
up
it
didn
t
come
down
with
a
crash
as
one
might
have
expected
when
we
had
pumped
about
twenty
shots
into
it
and
it
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
away
it
began
to
dwindle
the
column
of
water
became
smaller
and
drew
itself
out
to
nothing
the
rushing
noise
ceased
the
hole
in
the
sea
disappeared
in
a
lazy
eddy
the
dark
funnel
rose
and
blended
with
the
clouds
above
a
fine
southeast
breeze
sprang
up
as
the
clouds
dispersed
and
we
were
reaching
away
for
penrhyn
when
a
boy
up
forward
gave
a
shout
and
pointed
to
the
northwest
sure
enough
there
was
a
faint
line
on
the
palms
of
mataora
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me
i
was
fed
up
with
the
schooner
why
not
ask
to
be
put
ashore
and
picked
up
on
the
return
from
penrhyn
she
would
be
back
in
a
fortnight
and
it
was
only
a
few
miles
out
of
her
way
to
drop
me
and
pick
me
up
johnson
is
a
good
fellow
his
answer
to
my
proposition
was
to
change
his
course
at
once
and
slack
away
for
the
land
twelve
miles
to
leeward
you
ll
have
a
great
time
he
said
i
wish
i
were
going
with
you
old
tari
will
put
you
ll
give
you
a
word
to
him
take
along
two
or
three
bags
of
flour
and
a
few
presents
for
the
at
five
o
clock
we
were
off
the
principal
village
with
canoes
all
about
us
and
more
coming
out
through
the
surf
the
men
were
a
fine
brawny
lot
joking
with
the
crew
and
eager
for
news
and
small
trade
i
lowered
my
box
some
flour
tobacco
and
a
few
bolts
of
calico
into
the
largest
canoe
and
said
to
johnson
it
was
nearly
a
year
before
i
saw
him
again
as
you
know
he
lost
the
on
flying
venus
shoal
they
made
penrhyn
in
the
boat
and
got
a
passage
to
tahiti
two
months
later
everyone
knew
i
was
on
mataora
but
it
was
five
months
before
a
schooner
could
come
to
take
me
off
there
is
no
pass
into
the
lagoon
as
we
drew
near
the
shore
i
saw
that
the
easy
deceptive
swell
reared
up
to
form
an
ugly
surf
ahead
of
us
at
one
point
where
a
crowd
of
people
was
gathered
there
was
a
large
irregular
fissure
in
the
coral
broad
and
deep
enough
to
admit
the
passage
of
a
small
boat
and
filled
with
rushing
water
each
time
a
breaker
crashed
on
the
reef
my
two
paddlers
stopped
opposite
this
fissure
and
just
outside
the
surf
watching
over
their
shoulders
for
the
right
wave
they
let
four
or
five
ones
pass
backing
water
gently
with
their
paddles
but
at
last
a
proper
one
came
rearing
and
tossing
its
crest
till
i
thought
it
would
break
before
it
reached
us
my
men
dug
their
paddles
into
the
water
shouting
exultantly
as
we
darted
forward
the
shouts
were
echoed
on
shore
by
jove
it
was
a
thriller
tilting
just
on
the
break
of
the
wave
we
flew
in
between
jagged
walls
of
coral
up
the
fissure
around
a
before
the
water
began
to
rush
back
a
dozen
men
and
women
had
plunged
in
waist
deep
to
seize
the
canoe
mataora
is
made
up
of
a
chain
of
low
densely
covered
with
coconut
together
in
a
rough
oval
to
inclose
a
lagoon
five
miles
by
three
though
there
is
no
pass
the
surf
at
high
tide
breaches
over
the
gaps
between
the
islands
the
largest
island
is
only
a
mile
and
a
half
long
and
none
of
them
are
more
than
half
a
mile
across
dotted
about
the
surface
of
the
lagoon
are
a
number
of
with
its
flock
of
sea
fowl
its
clump
of
palms
and
shining
beach
of
coral
sand
set
in
a
lonely
stretch
of
the
pacific
the
place
is
almost
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
outside
world
twice
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
a
year
a
trading
schooner
calls
to
leave
supplies
and
take
off
copra
undisturbed
by
contact
with
civilization
the
life
of
mataora
flows
placid
and
agreeably
little
changed
i
fancy
since
the
old
days
it
is
true
that
they
have
a
native
missionary
and
use
calico
flour
and
tobacco
when
they
can
get
them
but
these
are
minor
things
the
great
events
in
their
annals
are
the
outrage
of
the
peruvian
slavers
in
eighteen
when
many
of
the
people
were
carried
off
to
labor
and
die
in
the
chinchas
islands
and
the
hurricane
of
nineteen
thirteen
after
presenting
myself
to
the
missionary
and
the
chief
i
was
escorted
by
a
crowd
of
youngsters
to
the
lagoon
side
of
the
island
where
tairi
lived
in
a
spot
cooled
by
the
trade
wind
and
pleasantly
shaded
by
coconuts
the
old
chap
was
a
warm
friend
of
johnson
s
and
made
me
welcome
i
soon
arranged
to
put
up
with
him
during
my
stay
on
the
island
his
house
like
all
the
mataora
houses
was
worth
a
bit
of
study
pandanus
logs
five
or
six
inches
in
diameter
and
set
four
feet
apart
made
the
uprights
on
each
side
of
these
logs
and
extending
from
top
to
bottom
a
groove
was
cut
thin
laths
split
from
the
aerial
roots
of
the
pandanus
were
set
horizontally
into
the
grooves
making
a
wall
which
permitted
the
free
circulation
of
air
at
the
windward
end
of
the
house
a
large
shutter
of
the
same
material
was
hung
on
hinges
of
bark
on
warm
days
it
could
be
opened
to
admit
the
breeze
the
plates
and
rafters
were
made
of
the
trunks
of
old
coconut
beautiful
hard
wood
which
blackens
with
age
and
can
be
polished
like
mahogany
the
roof
was
thatched
with
of
wood
over
which
were
doubled
selected
leaves
of
pandanus
six
feet
long
and
four
inches
across
the
kakao
are
laid
on
like
shingles
so
deeply
overlapped
that
only
six
inches
of
each
is
exposed
and
the
result
is
a
cool
and
perfectly
roof
which
lasts
for
years
the
floor
of
tari
s
house
was
of
fine
white
gravel
covered
with
mats
a
bed
of
mats
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
fishing
gear
and
a
bible
in
the
rarotongan
language
made
up
the
furniture
the
old
man
had
been
a
pearl
diver
for
many
years
he
knew
all
the
lagoons
of
this
part
of
the
pacific
and
could
give
the
history
of
every
large
pearl
discovered
in
these
waters
twenty
fathoms
he
considered
an
ordinary
depth
for
the
naked
the
limit
one
day
he
went
too
deep
and
since
then
he
had
been
a
cripple
with
paralyzed
legs
dependent
for
care
on
the
kindly
people
of
his
island
he
busied
himself
in
carving
out
models
of
the
ancient
polynesian
sailing
canoes
beautifully
shaped
and
polished
inlaid
with
shell
and
provided
with
sails
of
now
and
then
he
presented
a
canoe
to
the
captain
of
a
trading
schooner
visiting
the
island
and
received
in
return
a
bag
of
flour
or
a
few
sticks
of
tobacco
i
had
some
interesting
yarns
with
speak
rarotongan
and
the
mataora
language
is
a
good
deal
the
same
they
have
three
extra
consonants
by
the
f
l
and
what
a
puzzle
these
island
dialects
are
tairi
told
me
a
lot
about
pearl
fishing
the
people
had
divided
their
lagoon
into
three
sections
one
of
which
was
fished
each
year
in
this
way
each
section
got
a
two
years
rest
the
shell
is
the
object
of
the
are
a
secondary
issue
the
divers
are
not
much
afraid
of
sharks
but
dread
the
tonu
and
the
big
conger
eel
some
years
before
when
tari
was
resting
in
a
boat
after
a
spell
under
water
one
of
his
companions
failed
to
return
to
the
surface
looking
through
his
water
glass
he
saw
a
great
tonu
lying
on
the
bottom
sixty
feet
beneath
legs
of
his
comrade
hanging
from
its
jaws
fancy
the
ugly
brute
ten
feet
long
and
all
head
like
an
overgrown
rock
cod
with
a
man
in
his
mouth
tairi
and
several
others
seized
their
spears
and
were
over
the
side
next
moment
they
killed
the
tonu
but
too
late
to
save
the
life
of
their
companion
conger
eels
grow
to
enormous
size
in
the
pearl
lagoons
and
the
divers
keep
a
close
watch
for
them
they
lie
in
holes
and
crevices
of
the
coral
and
dart
out
their
heads
to
seize
a
passing
fish
or
the
wrist
of
a
diver
stooping
and
intent
on
his
task
when
the
conger
s
jaws
close
on
wrist
or
ankle
the
diver
needs
a
cool
head
no
amount
of
struggling
will
pull
the
eel
from
his
hole
one
must
wait
quietly
tairi
told
me
until
the
conger
relaxes
his
jaws
preparatory
to
taking
a
better
grip
then
a
quick
wrench
and
one
is
free
on
an
atoll
like
mataora
where
the
food
supply
is
limited
to
fish
and
coconuts
with
a
chicken
or
a
piece
of
pork
as
an
occasional
treat
fishing
plays
a
large
part
in
the
life
of
the
people
the
men
were
all
expert
fishermen
and
used
a
variety
of
ingenious
methods
to
catch
the
different
kinds
of
fish
tairi
of
course
was
no
longer
able
to
go
out
but
a
friend
of
old
fellow
named
to
take
me
with
him
he
was
a
fine
feet
tall
muscular
and
active
as
a
boy
with
clear
eyes
and
thick
gray
hair
one
day
he
proposed
trying
for
koperu
a
small
variety
of
mackerel
the
settlement
is
on
the
lee
side
of
the
island
where
a
coral
shoal
runs
out
half
a
mile
to
sea
covered
with
twenty
to
forty
fathoms
of
water
it
was
early
in
the
dead
we
launched
the
big
canoe
and
slipped
out
through
the
surf
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
offshore
tamatoa
asked
me
to
hold
the
canoe
stationary
while
he
went
about
his
fishing
fastening
a
rope
to
the
thwart
he
made
a
noose
at
the
other
end
and
passed
it
under
his
arms
then
he
took
a
ripe
coconut
split
it
and
gouged
out
the
meat
with
his
knife
with
the
white
pulp
in
one
hand
he
slipped
overboard
and
swam
down
as
far
as
the
rope
would
let
him
through
my
water
glass
i
watched
him
put
pieces
of
coconut
into
his
mouth
and
blow
out
clouds
of
the
finely
chewed
stuff
which
drifted
and
eddied
about
him
in
the
gentle
current
he
seemed
to
stay
under
lungs
of
a
pearl
diver
are
wonderful
things
now
and
then
he
came
to
the
surface
for
a
fresh
supply
of
chum
and
first
in
twos
and
threes
and
then
in
koperu
began
to
appear
from
the
depths
little
by
little
he
enticed
them
close
to
the
surface
until
they
swam
all
about
him
fearlessly
gobbling
the
morsels
of
coconut
at
last
the
old
man
reached
up
for
his
fishing
twig
with
a
bit
of
doubled
sewing
cotton
and
a
tiny
barbless
hook
he
baited
the
hook
with
a
particle
of
coconut
and
dangled
it
under
the
nose
of
the
nearest
koperu
while
he
hung
on
the
shortened
rope
just
beneath
the
surface
his
right
arm
broke
water
in
a
series
of
jerks
and
each
time
it
rose
a
fish
tumbled
into
the
canoe
until
they
lay
in
the
bottom
by
dozens
though
the
people
of
mataora
made
sport
of
their
work
they
had
plenty
of
leisure
for
other
things
in
the
evening
when
the
tasks
of
the
day
had
been
completed
by
lighting
the
lamps
in
the
sleeping
places
of
the
dead
the
young
people
loved
to
gather
for
a
session
of
telling
they
met
in
some
one
s
house
or
brought
mats
to
spread
in
the
bright
moonlight
outside
and
while
the
others
lay
about
intent
on
the
tale
one
after
another
related
the
adventures
of
some
polynesian
hero
or
the
loves
of
some
legendary
island
fragments
from
the
old
days
full
of
specters
and
devils
and
monstrous
heathen
gods
there
was
a
girl
named
porima
who
told
her
stories
marvelously
tall
youngster
of
seventeen
with
a
dash
of
blood
hawaiian
i
think
she
was
an
artist
in
her
way
one
could
imagine
in
her
the
pioneer
of
a
literature
to
come
her
broad
forehead
the
masses
of
black
hair
which
from
time
to
time
with
an
impatient
gesture
she
shook
back
over
her
shoulders
and
the
slumberous
eyes
with
a
suggestion
of
hypnotic
power
made
her
a
person
not
easily
forgotten
although
she
had
told
them
many
times
porima
s
stories
never
failed
to
hold
her
audience
the
whispering
ceased
when
she
began
and
every
head
turned
toward
where
she
sat
her
hands
continually
in
motion
her
voice
rising
in
excitement
or
dying
away
to
a
murmur
while
the
listeners
held
their
breath
as
the
hours
passed
both
audience
and
performers
used
to
grow
weary
and
drop
off
to
sleep
one
by
one
finally
a
rooster
crowed
and
one
awoke
with
a
start
to
realize
that
it
was
day
one
evening
at
a
story
telling
i
heard
a
shout
from
the
beach
and
remembered
that
i
had
been
invited
to
go
after
flying
fish
a
dozen
canoes
were
putting
out
through
the
surf
each
manned
by
four
paddlers
i
made
a
fourth
in
the
last
canoe
we
shot
out
of
the
opening
with
a
receding
wave
paddled
desperately
through
the
surf
and
a
moment
later
were
rocking
gently
beyond
the
breakers
the
canoes
were
formed
into
a
rough
line
each
lit
a
torch
of
coconut
leaves
bound
with
bark
and
a
man
forward
took
his
place
in
hand
the
net
is
like
a
shallow
landing
net
set
on
a
haft
of
stiff
bamboo
and
can
be
handled
only
after
years
of
unconscious
training
my
position
paddling
amidships
enabled
me
to
watch
how
the
net
was
doesn
t
often
see
such
an
exhibition
of
dexterity
and
strength
the
art
consists
in
clapping
the
net
over
the
fish
just
at
the
moment
when
he
is
lying
at
the
surface
hesitating
before
taking
flight
at
any
instant
the
netter
may
see
a
fish
to
port
to
starboard
or
directly
ahead
our
man
swung
his
net
continually
and
each
time
it
passed
over
the
canoe
he
flipped
it
to
drop
a
fish
think
of
the
muscles
needed
for
this
sort
of
thing
the
quickness
of
eye
and
hand
where
a
delicate
balance
must
be
maintained
and
one
is
constantly
alert
to
guard
one
s
face
against
the
fish
which
whizz
past
at
all
angles
then
remember
that
it
is
a
pretty
serious
matter
to
capsize
in
this
water
swarming
with
sharks
where
it
is
imprudent
even
to
trail
one
s
hand
overboard
in
the
bend
of
a
islet
at
the
north
end
of
the
lagoon
under
the
palms
behind
a
shore
of
blue
water
and
dazzling
sand
lived
an
old
chap
named
ruri
who
introduced
me
to
another
kind
of
fishing
ruri
was
close
to
seventy
but
a
strong
man
still
his
only
complaint
was
lack
of
teeth
which
compelled
him
to
live
on
meat
of
the
young
coconut
mixed
with
its
own
milk
the
ambition
of
his
life
was
a
trip
to
tahiti
to
get
a
set
of
false
teeth
he
was
not
a
native
of
mother
was
a
and
his
father
a
samoan
for
many
years
ruri
had
followed
the
boy
under
bully
hayes
deserter
to
keep
a
whole
skin
from
the
famous
blackbirder
in
the
new
hebrides
and
solomon
islands
pearl
fisher
in
penrhyn
and
the
lagoons
of
the
paumotu
at
last
on
a
black
night
of
storm
his
vessel
struck
and
went
to
pieces
on
the
coral
of
mataora
and
ruri
s
days
of
wandering
were
over
he
married
a
woman
of
the
island
but
now
she
was
dead
and
the
old
man
lived
alone
a
mile
from
the
settlement
occupied
with
his
simple
wants
and
immersed
in
dreams
of
the
past
close
beside
his
house
was
the
grave
of
his
tomb
of
cement
inclosed
in
a
neat
building
of
octagonal
shape
with
a
door
and
a
small
curtained
window
a
fine
lamp
carefully
tended
and
lit
every
evening
at
sunset
hung
above
the
grave
and
a
few
stunted
gardenias
and
frangipanis
brought
from
enormous
distances
were
planted
about
the
door
ruri
s
little
plantation
of
coconuts
and
coarse
taro
was
free
from
weeds
and
the
neatness
of
his
house
shipshape
and
scrupulously
clean
betrayed
the
old
sailor
after
a
spell
of
calm
weather
when
the
breaching
surf
had
ceased
to
cloud
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
the
suspended
particles
of
coral
sand
had
settled
to
the
bottom
ruri
offered
to
show
me
how
to
catch
fine
fish
inhabiting
the
lagoon
in
ten
to
twenty
fathoms
of
like
a
trout
on
a
ground
of
brown
and
gold
and
reaching
a
weight
of
twenty
pounds
in
the
absurdly
complicated
process
of
obtaining
bait
is
typical
of
the
south
pacific
the
night
before
ruri
had
spent
two
hours
with
a
torch
catching
hermit
crabs
now
using
these
crabs
for
bait
we
had
to
catch
some
ku
small
prickly
fish
which
alone
has
power
to
interest
the
tenu
we
set
out
in
ruri
s
leaky
canoe
and
paddled
to
a
big
coral
mushroom
which
rose
to
within
a
yard
of
the
surface
here
the
old
man
smashed
the
shells
of
his
hermit
crabs
with
a
stone
broke
off
the
claws
set
the
soft
bodies
to
one
side
and
mashed
the
claws
to
a
paste
which
he
dropped
overboard
and
allowed
to
drift
into
a
dark
hole
in
the
coral
then
he
produced
a
short
line
baited
the
hook
with
a
body
of
a
crab
and
let
it
sink
out
of
sight
into
the
darkness
of
the
hole
in
ten
minutes
a
dozen
ku
ta
were
gasping
in
the
bottom
of
the
little
fish
colored
scarlet
and
vermilion
with
enormous
black
eyes
and
a
dorsal
fin
which
seemed
to
be
carved
out
of
red
sealing
wax
we
put
them
in
a
basket
trailed
overboard
to
keep
them
alive
and
began
the
real
fishing
of
the
day
i
paddled
slowly
while
did
not
believe
in
fishing
till
the
fish
was
in
over
the
side
scrutinizing
the
bottom
through
his
water
glass
finally
he
signaled
me
to
eye
had
caught
the
movement
of
a
tenu
among
the
masses
of
live
coral
forty
feet
below
us
the
rest
was
simple
one
hooked
a
ku
ta
under
the
dorsal
fin
tossed
him
overboard
and
allowed
the
weight
of
the
hook
and
line
to
carry
him
to
the
bottom
by
means
of
the
water
glass
one
could
watch
the
approach
of
the
tenu
see
him
seize
the
bait
and
judge
the
proper
moment
to
strike
the
bonito
which
they
call
atu
is
the
most
important
of
all
fish
to
the
people
of
mataora
almost
any
fine
day
one
could
see
a
fleet
of
canoes
working
offshore
busy
at
bonito
catching
surrounded
by
a
cloud
of
the
sea
birds
which
guide
one
to
the
schools
they
use
a
pretty
lure
for
this
sort
of
jig
cut
out
of
equipped
with
a
tuft
of
coconut
husk
and
a
barbless
hook
of
shell
each
fisherman
carries
a
stiff
bamboo
rod
and
half
a
dozen
of
these
in
color
from
pale
green
to
to
lengths
of
line
the
islanders
have
discovered
that
the
condition
of
the
water
and
the
variations
of
light
make
certain
colors
more
attractive
than
others
at
a
given
time
and
when
a
school
is
found
they
try
one
shade
after
another
till
they
discover
which
the
bonito
prefer
then
the
jigs
not
in
use
are
hooked
to
a
ring
at
the
base
of
the
pole
and
the
fisherman
begins
to
pull
bonito
from
the
water
heaving
them
out
by
main
strength
without
a
moment
s
play
the
barbless
hook
releases
itself
the
moment
the
fish
is
in
the
canoe
and
the
lure
goes
overboard
without
the
loss
of
an
instant
one
day
after
a
period
of
low
tides
i
saw
another
method
of
practised
ora
or
picnic
you
know
the
barringtonia
big
tree
from
which
they
make
their
drums
it
grows
on
all
the
high
islands
and
sometimes
one
finds
it
on
the
richer
atolls
there
were
a
few
on
mataora
ever
notice
the
flower
it
is
a
lovely
tassel
of
silky
stamens
shading
to
old
rose
at
the
ends
and
tipped
with
golden
beads
the
fruit
is
like
a
squarish
pomegranate
and
it
has
odd
properties
for
when
pounded
up
and
put
into
shallow
water
it
seems
to
stupefy
the
fish
i
was
sitting
in
the
shade
beside
tari
s
house
when
a
boy
came
through
the
settlement
blowing
melancholy
blasts
on
a
conch
shell
and
announcing
that
the
chief
wanted
everyone
to
be
on
hand
that
afternoon
at
a
certain
part
of
the
lagoon
where
an
ora
was
to
be
held
we
set
out
at
noon
the
women
carrying
the
crushed
seeds
of
the
barringtonia
in
hastily
woven
baskets
of
green
coconut
frond
a
crowd
from
the
other
settlements
was
awaiting
our
arrival
and
when
the
babies
had
been
put
to
sleep
in
the
shade
with
small
children
stationed
beside
them
to
fan
away
the
flies
the
fun
began
a
shallow
stretch
of
lagoon
lay
before
us
half
a
mile
long
by
a
quarter
wide
and
into
this
plunged
the
women
and
girls
wading
and
swimming
in
all
directions
trailing
behind
them
their
baskets
of
poison
as
time
went
on
a
faint
and
curious
odor
began
to
rise
from
the
smell
which
reminded
me
vaguely
of
potassium
cyanide
soon
the
spearmen
were
brown
figures
naked
except
for
scarlet
loin
the
fish
among
the
crevices
of
the
coral
before
the
effect
of
the
poison
wore
off
and
the
reviving
fish
began
to
make
their
escape
to
deeper
water
the
men
were
returning
to
the
beach
the
strings
of
hibiscus
bark
at
their
belts
loaded
and
dragging
on
another
day
i
joined
a
party
of
young
people
for
a
picnic
across
the
lagoon
it
was
glassy
calm
the
water
was
like
a
mirror
in
which
the
palms
of
the
wooded
islets
were
reflected
with
motionless
perfection
the
beaches
on
the
far
side
invisible
on
an
ordinary
day
seemed
to
rise
far
out
of
water
in
the
mirage
we
landed
on
an
uninhabited
island
hauled
up
our
canoes
and
set
out
on
a
hunt
for
coconut
crabs
they
are
extraordinary
creatures
these
crabs
enormous
and
delicious
to
eat
you
will
not
find
many
on
the
high
islands
but
in
a
place
like
mataora
there
are
hundreds
of
them
and
they
do
a
lot
of
damage
to
the
coconuts
during
the
day
they
hide
in
their
holes
deep
among
the
roots
of
some
big
trees
at
night
they
come
out
climb
the
palms
nip
off
the
nuts
with
their
powerful
claws
descend
to
the
ground
tear
off
the
husks
break
open
the
shells
and
devour
the
meat
to
catch
them
one
can
either
dig
them
out
or
build
a
fire
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
which
never
fails
to
draw
them
fire
simply
fascinates
the
brutes
they
must
be
handled
warily
for
their
claws
can
grip
like
a
pair
of
pipe
tongs
and
shear
off
a
man
s
finger
without
an
effort
we
lit
a
fire
under
the
shade
of
a
puka
tree
and
liberated
the
crabs
we
had
captured
it
sounds
incredible
but
they
walked
into
the
fire
and
sat
down
quietly
on
the
embers
to
roast
one
of
the
boys
climbed
a
palm
and
brought
us
some
coconuts
of
a
variety
called
nu
mangaro
with
an
edible
husk
sweet
and
fibrous
like
sugar
cane
after
lunch
we
had
a
swim
in
the
deep
water
close
inshore
and
lay
about
smoking
while
the
girls
wove
us
wreaths
of
sweet
fern
it
was
an
idyllic
sort
of
a
day
i
spent
five
months
on
mataora
at
first
when
the
schooner
did
not
appear
i
was
worried
and
used
to
fret
a
little
but
as
time
went
on
i
grew
to
like
the
dreamy
life
and
when
at
last
a
schooner
came
to
take
me
off
i
didn
t
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
were
moments
when
i
almost
decided
to
send
for
a
few
things
and
follow
the
example
of
old
ruri
during
those
five
months
i
knew
more
disinterested
kindliness
than
i
had
supposed
existed
in
the
world
my
heart
warmed
to
the
people
of
mataora
finally
the
day
came
when
the
schooner
dropped
anchor
in
the
lee
of
the
s
canoe
after
canoe
shot
out
through
the
surf
the
women
gathered
in
the
shade
of
the
canoe
houses
on
the
beach
awaiting
the
landing
of
the
boatmen
who
would
bring
news
of
husbands
diving
for
shell
in
distant
lagoons
or
relatives
scattered
among
groups
of
islands
as
i
shook
hands
with
whitmore
i
heard
a
prolonged
wailing
from
the
tangi
of
a
new
widow
when
i
went
to
the
house
to
get
my
things
together
tari
informed
me
that
as
the
schooner
would
not
leave
till
next
day
the
people
were
preparing
a
farewell
feast
in
my
honor
it
was
held
in
the
assembly
house
of
the
village
decorated
with
arches
of
palm
frond
garlands
of
scented
fern
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
hibiscus
everyone
brought
a
gift
for
the
departing
fan
a
hat
a
pearl
fishhook
a
drinking
cup
of
ornamented
coconut
shell
a
carved
paddle
of
porcupine
wood
inlaid
with
i
distributed
what
little
i
had
to
offer
wishing
it
were
a
dozen
times
as
much
on
the
beach
next
morning
the
people
of
mataora
gathered
for
a
last
handclasp
smile
cynically
if
you
were
tears
shed
i
wasn
t
too
happy
myself
when
i
heard
their
plaintive
song
of
farewell
floating
out
across
the
water
worthington
ceased
speaking
and
leaned
forward
to
scratch
a
match
the
squall
had
passed
long
since
the
immense
arch
of
the
milky
way
stretched
overhead
and
low
in
the
hull
island
and
rimatara
over
the
loneliest
ocean
in
the
southern
cross
was
rising
lying
on
mats
behind
us
a
party
of
spoke
in
soft
tones
their
faces
illuminated
fitfully
by
the
glow
of
their
cigarettes
my
companion
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
in
the
flare
of
the
match
i
could
see
that
he
was
smiling
to
himself
some
day
he
said
you
will
hear
that
i
have
closed
up
my
affairs
and
disappeared
don
t
worry
when
that
happens
you
ll
know
i
have
gone
to
time
to
stop
for
good
land
of
ahu
i
might
attempt
to
set
down
a
description
of
this
place
if
only
the
subject
permitted
one
to
be
strange
and
remote
set
in
a
lonely
space
of
the
sea
and
isolated
from
the
world
for
the
seven
or
eight
centuries
following
the
decline
of
polynesian
navigation
there
is
no
other
land
like
this
hollow
island
of
ahu
ahu
week
after
week
month
after
month
the
watcher
on
its
cliffs
may
gaze
out
toward
the
horizon
and
see
never
a
sail
nor
a
distant
trail
of
smoke
to
liven
the
desert
of
the
pacific
the
cliffs
themselves
are
reef
of
an
ancient
atoll
upraised
in
some
convulsion
of
the
earth
to
form
a
ring
of
coral
precipices
facing
the
sea
half
a
mile
of
level
barren
summit
and
an
inner
wall
of
cliffs
overlooking
the
rich
lowlands
of
the
interior
during
the
unnumbered
years
of
their
occupation
the
land
has
set
a
stamp
upon
its
long
on
ahu
ahu
that
they
have
forgotten
whence
they
came
hardy
hospitable
and
turbulent
they
are
true
children
of
the
islands
and
yet
a
family
and
less
languid
than
the
people
of
samoa
or
tahiti
and
speaking
a
harsher
tongue
and
more
than
any
other
island
folk
they
live
in
the
past
for
ghosts
walk
on
ahu
ahu
and
the
living
commune
nightly
with
the
old
dead
who
lie
in
the
it
was
an
hour
before
sunset
when
we
sighted
the
merest
blue
irregularity
on
the
horizon
visible
from
one
s
perch
in
the
shrouds
each
time
the
schooner
rose
to
the
crest
of
a
sea
the
mellow
shout
of
landfall
brought
a
score
of
native
passengers
to
their
feet
at
such
a
moment
one
realizes
the
passionate
devotion
of
the
islander
to
his
land
men
sprang
into
the
rigging
to
gaze
ahead
with
eager
exclamations
mothers
held
up
their
on
distant
a
first
glimpse
of
ahu
ahu
seasick
old
women
emerging
from
disordered
heaps
of
matting
tottered
to
the
bulwarks
with
eyes
alight
the
island
had
not
been
visited
for
six
months
and
we
carried
a
cargo
of
extraordinary
bolts
of
calico
soap
lumber
jewelry
iron
roofing
cement
groceries
phonograph
records
an
unfortunate
horse
and
several
pigs
those
inevitable
in
the
island
trade
there
were
scores
of
cases
of
bully
beef
and
ship
s
staple
luxuries
of
modern
polynesia
and
most
important
of
all
six
heavy
bags
of
mail
as
we
drew
near
the
land
toward
midnight
i
gave
up
the
attempt
to
sleep
in
my
berth
and
went
on
deck
to
spread
a
mat
beside
tari
our
supercargo
who
lay
aft
of
the
mainmast
talking
in
low
tones
with
his
wife
it
was
calm
here
in
the
lee
of
the
island
the
schooner
slipped
through
the
water
with
scarcely
a
sound
rising
and
falling
on
the
long
gentle
swell
faint
puffs
of
air
came
off
the
land
bringing
a
scent
of
flowers
and
wood
smoke
and
moist
earth
we
had
been
sighted
for
lights
were
beginning
to
appear
in
the
village
now
and
then
on
a
flaw
of
the
breeze
one
heard
a
sigh
long
drawn
and
half
voice
of
the
reef
a
party
of
natives
seated
on
the
forward
hatch
began
to
sing
the
words
were
modern
and
religious
i
believe
but
the
sad
wild
and
one
back
through
the
centuries
to
the
days
when
man
expressed
the
dim
yearnings
of
his
spirit
in
communal
song
it
was
a
species
of
chant
with
responses
four
girls
did
most
of
the
singing
their
voices
mingling
in
barbaric
harmonies
each
verse
ending
in
a
prolonged
melodious
wail
precisely
as
the
last
note
died
away
in
time
with
the
cadence
of
the
chant
the
deep
voices
of
the
men
took
up
the
response
aué
no
alas
tari
turned
to
me
they
sing
well
he
said
these
ahu
ahu
people
i
like
to
listen
to
them
that
is
a
hymn
but
a
stranger
would
never
suspect
music
is
pure
heathen
look
at
the
torchlights
in
the
village
smell
the
land
would
tell
you
you
were
in
the
islands
if
you
were
set
down
here
blindfold
from
a
place
ten
thousand
miles
away
with
that
singing
in
one
s
ears
it
is
not
difficult
to
fancy
oneself
in
a
long
canoe
at
the
end
of
an
voyage
chanting
a
song
of
thanksgiving
to
the
gods
who
have
brought
us
safely
home
he
is
by
no
means
the
traditional
supercargo
of
a
trading
schooner
this
tari
i
have
wasted
a
good
deal
of
time
speculating
as
to
his
origin
and
the
reasons
for
his
choosing
this
mode
of
life
an
englishman
with
a
hint
of
oxford
in
his
obviously
what
we
call
a
reader
of
reviews
the
possessor
at
his
charming
place
on
nukutere
of
an
enviable
collection
of
books
on
the
natural
history
and
ethnology
of
the
south
seas
he
seldom
speaks
of
himself
or
of
his
people
at
home
for
twenty
years
he
has
been
known
in
this
part
of
the
on
penrhyn
rakahanga
tupuai
the
atolls
of
the
paumotu
he
speaks
a
dozen
of
the
island
dialects
can
join
in
the
singing
of
or
bring
a
roar
of
applause
by
his
skill
in
the
dances
of
widely
separated
groups
when
the
war
broke
out
he
enlisted
as
a
private
in
a
new
zealand
battalion
and
the
close
of
hostilities
found
him
with
decorations
for
gallantry
the
rank
of
captain
and
the
scars
of
honorable
wounds
as
a
subject
for
conversation
the
war
interests
him
as
little
as
his
own
life
but
this
evening
he
had
emptied
a
full
bottle
of
rum
and
was
in
the
mildly
mellow
state
which
is
his
nearest
approach
to
intoxication
i
never
thought
i
d
see
the
old
country
again
he
said
but
the
war
changed
all
that
i
got
a
nasty
wound
in
gallipoli
you
see
and
they
sent
me
home
to
convalesce
the
family
wasn
t
meant
to
know
i
was
hurt
but
they
saw
a
bit
of
a
thing
in
the
paper
an
account
of
the
exploit
which
won
tari
his
and
there
they
were
at
the
dock
when
the
transport
i
hadn
t
laid
eyes
on
them
for
fifteen
years
the
old
jove
he
was
decent
it
was
all
arranged
that
i
should
stop
in
england
when
the
war
was
over
i
thought
myself
it
was
a
go
when
the
job
was
finished
and
i
d
got
a
special
dispensation
to
be
demobbed
at
home
i
stood
it
for
a
fortnight
and
then
gave
up
home
is
all
very
well
for
a
week
or
two
but
for
a
steady
thing
i
seem
to
fit
in
better
down
here
what
is
it
that
makes
a
chap
stop
in
the
islands
you
must
have
felt
it
yourself
and
yet
it
is
hard
to
put
into
words
this
sort
of
thing
perhaps
he
swept
his
hand
through
the
soft
darkness
the
beauty
the
sense
of
remoteness
the
vague
and
agreeable
melancholy
of
these
places
then
i
like
the
way
the
years
slip
pleasant
monotony
of
life
my
friends
at
home
put
up
with
a
kind
of
dullness
which
would
drive
me
mad
but
here
where
there
is
even
less
to
distinguish
one
day
from
another
one
seems
never
to
grow
fretful
or
impatient
of
time
one
s
horizon
narrows
of
course
i
scarcely
look
at
the
newspaper
any
more
if
you
stop
here
you
will
find
yourself
unconsciously
drifting
into
the
native
state
of
mind
readjusting
your
sense
of
values
until
the
great
events
of
the
world
seem
far
off
and
unreal
and
your
interests
are
limited
to
your
own
business
the
vital
statistics
of
your
island
and
the
odd
kinks
of
human
nature
about
you
perhaps
this
is
the
way
we
are
meant
to
live
at
any
rate
it
brings
serenity
i
ve
been
here
too
long
to
sentimentalize
about
the
have
their
weak
points
and
plenty
of
them
allowing
for
these
you
ll
find
the
kanakas
a
good
sort
to
have
amusing
always
interesting
at
once
deep
artful
gay
simple
and
childish
at
bottom
they
are
not
very
different
from
ourselves
it
is
chiefly
a
matter
of
environment
consider
any
of
the
traders
who
came
here
as
fellows
who
will
buttonhole
you
and
spend
hours
abusing
the
truth
is
that
they
have
become
more
native
than
the
men
they
abuse
there
are
places
like
africa
where
one
can
live
among
a
primitive
people
and
absorb
nothing
from
them
their
point
of
view
is
too
alien
their
position
in
the
scale
of
humanity
too
widely
separated
from
our
own
it
is
different
in
the
islands
if
one
could
discover
the
truth
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
to
learn
that
these
people
were
distant
cousins
of
ours
the
whose
conclusions
i
haven
t
much
them
back
along
the
paths
of
successive
migrations
through
indonesia
to
northern
india
or
the
land
of
the
cushites
in
any
case
i
believe
that
the
blood
we
term
caucasian
flows
in
their
veins
the
legacy
of
ancestors
separated
from
the
parent
stock
so
long
ago
that
mankind
had
not
yet
learned
the
use
of
iron
and
they
are
old
these
island
tribes
who
were
discovering
new
lands
in
the
pacific
in
the
days
when
our
forefathers
wore
the
horns
of
bulls
upon
their
heads
don
t
judge
them
in
the
present
or
even
in
the
time
of
cook
they
were
a
dying
people
then
whose
decline
had
begun
five
or
six
hundred
years
before
it
seems
to
me
that
a
race
like
an
individual
grows
old
loses
heart
and
fades
away
on
nearly
every
island
they
are
dying
tragedy
an
inevitable
one
which
the
coming
of
the
european
has
hastened
but
not
caused
whether
or
not
it
may
be
accounted
for
on
grounds
of
a
distant
kinship
it
is
impossible
to
stop
long
in
the
islands
without
absorbing
to
a
certain
extent
the
native
point
of
view
things
which
seemed
rubbish
at
first
slowly
acquire
significance
one
begins
to
wonder
if
after
all
there
may
not
be
varieties
of
knowledge
lost
to
us
in
the
complexities
of
civilization
i
ve
seen
some
queer
things
myself
my
wife
s
mother
lives
on
ahu
ahu
where
her
ancestors
have
been
hereditary
rulers
since
maui
fished
the
island
out
of
the
sea
i
ve
known
the
family
a
good
many
years
and
long
before
i
married
apakura
the
old
lady
was
kind
enough
to
take
a
motherly
interest
in
me
i
always
put
up
with
her
when
we
touched
at
ahu
ahu
once
after
i
had
been
away
for
several
months
i
sat
down
to
have
a
yarn
with
her
and
was
beginning
to
tell
about
where
i
d
been
and
what
i
d
done
when
she
stopped
me
no
let
me
tell
you
she
said
with
an
odd
smile
and
upon
my
honor
she
to
the
details
i
got
the
secret
out
of
her
the
same
evening
she
is
very
friendly
it
seems
with
an
ancestor
of
woman
named
rakamoana
who
lived
hundred
and
is
buried
in
the
big
behind
the
village
when
one
of
the
family
is
off
on
a
trip
and
my
suspects
that
he
is
in
trouble
or
not
behaving
himself
she
puts
herself
into
a
kind
of
trance
calls
up
old
rakamoana
and
gets
all
the
facts
i
hope
the
habit
won
t
come
into
general
prove
jolly
awkward
eh
seriously
though
i
can
t
account
for
the
things
she
told
me
without
accepting
her
own
explanation
strange
if
there
were
a
germ
of
truth
in
the
legends
of
how
the
old
canoes
were
priests
in
a
state
of
trance
directing
the
helmsmen
which
way
to
steer
for
land
there
is
another
old
woman
on
ahu
ahu
whose
yarns
are
worth
hearing
many
years
ago
a
yankee
whaling
vessel
called
at
the
island
and
a
portuguese
harpooner
who
had
had
trouble
with
the
captain
deserted
and
hid
himself
in
the
bush
the
people
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
refused
to
give
him
up
so
finally
the
captain
was
obliged
to
sail
away
without
his
man
from
all
accounts
this
harpooner
must
have
been
a
good
chap
when
he
proved
that
he
was
no
common
white
waster
the
chief
gave
him
a
bit
of
land
and
a
girl
of
good
family
for
a
the
old
lady
of
whom
i
spoke
i
think
it
was
tools
he
needed
or
some
sort
of
gear
for
a
house
he
was
building
at
any
rate
when
another
whaler
touched
he
told
his
wife
that
he
was
going
on
a
voyage
to
earn
some
money
and
that
he
might
be
gone
a
year
there
was
a
kind
of
agreement
current
in
the
pacific
in
those
days
whereby
a
whaling
captain
promised
to
land
a
man
at
the
point
where
he
had
signed
him
on
well
the
harpooner
sailed
away
and
as
might
have
been
expected
his
wife
never
saw
him
again
but
here
comes
the
odd
part
of
the
story
the
deserted
wife
like
so
many
of
the
ahu
ahu
women
had
an
ancestor
who
kept
her
in
touch
with
current
events
being
particularly
fond
of
her
husband
she
indulged
in
a
trance
from
time
to
time
to
keep
herself
informed
as
to
his
welfare
several
months
after
his
departure
the
tragedy
in
detail
by
the
obliging
and
sympathetic
dweller
in
the
it
was
a
kind
of
vision
as
told
to
me
singularly
vivid
for
an
effort
of
pure
open
pacific
heaving
gently
and
ruffled
by
a
light
air
two
boats
from
rival
vessels
pursuing
the
same
whale
the
portuguese
harpooner
standing
in
the
bows
of
one
erect
and
intent
upon
the
chase
his
iron
the
first
by
a
second
of
time
to
strike
then
came
a
glimpse
of
the
two
boats
foaming
side
by
side
in
the
wake
of
the
whale
the
beginning
of
the
dispute
the
lancing
and
death
flurry
of
an
old
bull
sperm
the
rising
anger
of
the
two
harpooners
as
the
boats
rocked
gently
beside
the
floating
carcass
the
treacherous
thrust
the
long
red
blade
of
the
lance
standing
out
between
the
shoulders
of
the
portuguese
the
woman
awoke
from
her
trance
with
a
cry
of
anguish
her
husband
was
set
up
the
widow
s
one
might
have
thought
it
an
excellent
tale
concocted
to
save
the
face
of
a
deserted
wife
if
the
same
vessel
had
not
called
at
ahu
ahu
within
a
year
to
bring
news
of
the
husband
s
death
under
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
vision
what
is
one
to
believe
if
seeing
is
believing
then
count
me
a
believer
for
my
own
eyes
have
seen
an
incredible
thing
it
was
on
aitutaki
in
the
cook
group
an
old
chief
the
descendant
of
a
very
ancient
family
lay
ill
in
the
village
i
had
turned
in
early
as
i
d
promised
to
go
fishing
on
the
reef
when
the
tide
served
an
hour
after
midnight
you
know
how
the
spirits
of
the
dead
were
believed
to
flee
westward
to
hawaiki
and
how
their
voices
might
be
heard
at
night
calling
to
one
another
in
the
sky
as
they
drove
past
high
overhead
early
in
the
evening
as
i
lay
in
bed
a
boy
came
into
the
next
room
panting
with
excitement
he
had
been
to
a
plantation
in
the
hills
it
seemed
and
as
he
returned
just
after
dusk
had
heard
the
voices
of
a
shouting
multitude
passing
in
the
air
above
him
i
was
tired
and
paid
little
attention
to
his
story
but
for
some
reason
i
found
it
impossible
to
sleep
it
was
a
hot
night
very
still
and
sultry
with
something
in
the
air
that
made
one
s
nerves
twitch
every
time
a
coconut
frond
dropped
in
the
distance
i
was
still
lying
awake
when
my
fishing
companions
came
to
get
me
a
little
ahead
of
time
for
like
me
they
had
been
unable
to
sleep
we
would
wait
on
the
reef
they
suggested
where
it
was
sure
to
be
cool
until
the
tide
was
right
we
were
sitting
on
the
dry
coral
smoking
i
had
just
looked
at
my
watch
i
remember
it
lacked
a
few
minutes
to
one
o
clock
our
canoes
were
hauled
up
on
one
side
of
the
arutunga
western
pass
by
the
way
there
was
no
moon
suddenly
one
of
the
boys
touched
me
what
is
that
he
exclaimed
in
a
startled
voice
i
looked
up
the
others
were
rising
to
their
feet
two
flaring
lights
were
moving
across
the
lagoon
toward
and
very
swiftly
nearer
and
nearer
they
came
until
they
revealed
the
outlines
of
a
canoe
larger
than
any
built
in
the
islands
canoe
of
the
old
time
with
a
flaming
torch
set
at
prow
and
stern
while
we
stood
there
staring
in
silence
it
drew
abreast
of
us
moving
with
the
rush
of
a
swift
motor
boat
and
passed
to
sea
i
was
too
amazed
to
think
clearly
until
i
heard
one
of
the
boys
whisper
to
another
mate
te
chief
is
dead
the
great
canoe
bears
him
out
to
the
we
launched
our
canoes
and
crossed
the
lagoon
to
the
village
women
were
wailing
yes
the
old
man
was
had
drawn
his
last
breath
a
little
before
one
o
clock
remember
that
i
saw
this
thing
myself
perhaps
it
was
a
so
we
all
dreamed
alike
it
was
late
the
singing
died
away
the
lights
in
the
village
went
out
one
by
one
the
passage
in
the
ahu
ahu
reef
is
a
bad
place
by
chances
were
that
no
canoes
would
risk
it
till
dawn
tari
struck
a
match
for
an
instant
and
lay
down
on
the
mat
beside
his
wife
in
the
little
flare
of
light
i
saw
her
sleeping
in
the
unconscious
manner
of
a
child
i
know
their
pretty
one
in
pleasant
contrast
to
the
usual
ignoble
and
transitory
loves
of
white
and
brown
apakura
is
the
daughter
of
the
principal
family
of
this
mother
and
father
for
many
years
the
warm
friend
of
tari
he
had
petted
the
child
from
the
time
she
was
three
she
was
always
on
the
beach
to
meet
the
canoe
that
brought
him
ashore
and
he
for
his
part
never
forgot
the
small
gifts
for
which
she
waited
with
sparkling
eyes
on
his
rambles
about
the
island
the
little
girl
followed
tari
with
the
devotion
of
a
dog
many
a
time
clambering
along
the
base
of
the
cliffs
at
dawn
his
first
knowledge
of
her
presence
came
with
the
shrill
cry
of
mai
tari
and
he
waited
while
his
small
follower
managed
some
difficult
pile
of
coral
in
the
rear
their
friendship
had
only
tari
s
two
or
three
visits
a
year
to
feed
on
but
neither
forgot
and
in
the
course
of
time
as
the
child
learned
to
read
and
write
a
correspondence
serious
on
her
side
pleased
and
amused
on
his
when
he
went
away
to
the
war
she
was
slim
child
when
he
returned
she
was
sixteen
and
a
woman
though
he
did
not
know
it
on
this
occasion
in
the
evening
when
the
rest
of
the
family
had
gone
to
bed
he
sat
talking
with
apakura
s
rather
listening
while
the
old
woman
told
one
of
her
stories
of
life
on
ahu
ahu
equally
fascinating
and
long
drawn
out
it
is
not
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
scene
in
comfortable
in
bare
feet
and
a
half
reclining
against
the
wall
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
in
puffs
the
woman
on
the
floor
leaning
forward
in
earnest
voice
rising
falling
and
dying
to
a
whisper
in
the
extraordinary
manner
of
the
polynesian
teller
of
tales
her
hands
from
time
to
time
falling
simultaneously
with
a
loud
slap
to
her
knees
in
emphasis
of
some
point
in
the
narrative
the
story
ended
little
by
little
the
mother
led
the
conversation
to
the
subject
of
her
daughter
tari
began
to
praise
the
girl
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
the
old
woman
now
that
you
have
been
away
these
five
years
there
is
no
other
girl
like
her
said
tari
since
that
is
so
take
her
with
you
we
shall
be
pleased
all
of
in
particular
who
look
on
you
as
a
son
she
is
a
good
girl
she
can
sew
she
can
cook
and
the
young
men
say
that
she
is
beautiful
you
propose
that
i
take
her
as
a
wife
exclaimed
the
astonished
tari
to
whom
in
truth
the
idea
had
not
occurred
yes
why
not
you
need
a
wife
now
that
the
little
affair
of
tukonini
has
blown
over
but
think
am
forty
and
the
child
is
sixteen
it
is
not
fitting
young
wives
are
best
if
they
are
faithful
apakura
will
never
look
at
another
man
i
will
think
it
over
said
tari
let
us
leave
it
so
not
this
year
at
any
is
too
young
as
he
bade
her
good
night
and
turned
to
go
to
his
sleeping
place
the
old
woman
spoke
again
bear
one
thing
in
mind
she
said
with
a
smile
it
will
help
you
to
decide
consider
now
and
then
the
thought
of
my
daughter
married
to
another
in
the
end
as
is
often
the
case
it
was
apakura
who
settled
the
matter
next
morning
tari
was
busy
with
some
stock
taking
and
did
not
board
the
schooner
till
the
last
moment
or
his
mysterious
smiles
with
which
the
crew
greeted
him
they
were
a
dozen
miles
offshore
before
he
folded
the
last
of
his
papers
lit
a
pipe
and
went
on
deck
for
a
breath
of
air
the
old
woman
s
last
words
stuck
unpleasantly
in
his
mind
i
fancy
as
he
stood
there
smoking
with
his
back
to
the
companionway
all
at
once
he
saw
the
ahu
ahu
boy
he
had
known
since
his
eyes
from
the
binnacle
and
grin
from
ear
to
ear
at
the
same
moment
tari
felt
a
hand
slip
into
his
own
and
heard
a
small
familiar
voice
say
i
am
here
it
was
serious
than
usual
and
a
little
frightened
but
not
to
be
put
off
longer
they
were
married
in
tahiti
a
fortnight
later
it
was
apakura
s
voice
that
awakened
me
she
was
leaning
over
the
bulwark
in
eager
conversation
with
her
mother
who
had
come
off
in
the
first
canoe
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
cool
of
dawn
in
the
east
the
sky
was
flushing
behind
scattered
banks
of
clouds
tinted
in
wonderfully
delicate
shades
of
terra
cotta
a
dozen
big
outrigger
canoes
of
the
type
peculiar
to
this
island
were
coming
out
through
the
passage
each
paddled
by
four
men
who
shouted
as
their
heavy
craft
dashed
through
the
breakers
little
by
little
not
at
all
after
the
manner
of
traditional
dawn
in
the
tropics
the
light
increased
until
ahu
ahu
lay
fully
revealed
before
smoking
reef
the
shallow
lagoon
and
the
cliffs
their
summits
plumed
with
coconut
palms
a
crowd
of
islanders
was
already
gathering
on
the
reef
and
i
could
see
others
making
their
way
down
the
steep
path
from
the
settlement

he
said
pointing
to
two
white
figures
wading
gingerly
across
the
shallow
lagoon
to
the
reef
you
re
going
to
meet
a
pair
of
rare
ve
been
hard
doers
in
their
time
the
distant
figures
reached
the
edge
of
the
boat
passage
and
i
could
see
a
boy
beckoning
them
into
a
waiting
canoe
but
now
they
stopped
and
seemed
to
argue
with
many
gestures
tari
chuckled
no
use
trying
to
hurry
them
he
told
me
they
are
discussing
the
loss
of
the
she
went
ashore
here
in
the
late
ship
peter
was
one
of
her
crew
charley
had
just
come
here
to
trade
and
saw
the
whole
thing
they
ve
spent
twenty
years
thrashing
out
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
wreck
might
have
been
avoided
every
morning
after
breakfast
charley
strolls
across
to
peter
s
house
to
smoke
a
pipe
and
discuss
some
of
the
fine
points
every
evening
after
tea
peter
returns
the
visit
and
the
argument
goes
on
till
bedtime
charley
s
an
old
man
now
close
to
seventy
he
put
in
thirty
years
on
hiva
oa
in
the
marquesas
before
he
came
to
ahu
ahu
i
d
like
to
have
some
of
his
memories
notice
his
arms
if
he
pulls
his
sleeves
up
he
has
sixteen
children
on
hiva
oa
and
fourteen
numbered
he
says
he
never
can
remember
their
heathen
names
when
his
wife
died
in
the
north
he
gave
all
his
land
to
the
children
and
left
on
the
first
schooner
she
touched
at
papeete
but
he
didn
t
go
ashore
then
she
made
ahu
ahu
where
he
landed
and
established
himself
a
second
time
he
has
never
seen
a
motor
car
a
telephone
or
an
electric
light
presently
the
canoe
came
dancing
alongside
and
the
two
old
men
clambered
painfully
over
the
thin
hatchet
faced
and
stooping
charley
the
ruin
of
a
magnificent
man
he
towered
above
any
of
us
on
the
ancient
dweller
among
erect
his
head
still
carried
proudly
but
the
flesh
hanging
loose
and
withered
on
his
bones
it
was
easy
to
fancy
the
admiration
he
must
have
inspired
forty
years
ago
among
the
wild
people
in
whose
eyes
physical
strength
and
perfection
were
the
great
qualities
of
a
man
in
the
cabin
while
the
cook
squeezed
limes
for
the
first
of
many
rum
punches
charley
took
off
his
tunic
of
white
drill
and
as
he
sat
there
in
his
singlet
i
saw
that
his
arms
and
chest
like
his
face
were
tanned
to
an
indelible
dull
brown
and
that
patterns
in
tattooing
ran
from
wrist
to
blue
and
barbaric
i
never
learned
his
must
have
been
a
thing
to
stir
the
imagination
once
as
we
sat
drinking
tari
mentioned
stevenson
and
the
old
man
s
face
brightened
he
said
slowly
in
native
fashion
i
remember
him
well
he
came
to
hiva
oa
with
the
a
funny
fellow
he
was
thin
there
was
nothing
to
him
but
skin
and
bones
and
d
ask
you
a
hundred
in
a
minute
i
didn
t
take
to
him
at
first
but
he
was
all
right
he
didn
t
care
how
he
dressed
one
day
i
saw
him
walking
on
the
beach
with
nothing
on
but
a
pair
of
drawers
the
cook
plied
back
and
forth
removing
empty
glasses
and
bringing
full
ones
as
each
tray
was
set
on
the
table
of
a
lively
and
garrulous
old
his
glass
and
held
it
up
hurrah
he
exclaimed
down
she
goes
drawled
charley
and
tari
murmured
cheerio
at
the
end
of
two
hours
charley
s
eyes
were
beginning
to
glaze
and
peter
was
mumbling
vaguely
of
the
tari
rose
and
beckoned
to
me
make
yourselves
at
home
he
said
to
the
old
men
i
ve
got
to
go
ashore
akatara
will
give
you
lunch
whenever
you
want
it
as
our
canoe
made
for
the
reef
my
companion
told
me
there
was
to
be
a
feast
in
his
honor
and
that
his
wife
wished
me
to
be
present
we
shot
into
the
passage
without
a
wetting
the
people
crowded
about
tari
laughing
shaking
his
hand
speaking
all
at
unmistakable
warmth
of
welcome
the
settlement
reached
by
a
short
steep
trail
lies
at
the
base
of
a
break
in
the
cliffs
at
the
door
of
her
mother
s
house
apakura
met
out
as
becomes
a
supercargo
s
wife
in
the
choicest
of
trade
finery
she
wore
heavy
golden
earrings
bands
of
gold
were
on
her
fingers
and
her
loose
frock
was
of
pale
embroidered
silk
her
old
woman
i
had
seen
in
the
me
welcome
in
the
afternoon
when
the
feast
was
over
and
we
rose
stiffly
crammed
with
fish
and
taro
and
baked
pig
i
asked
tari
if
he
knew
a
youngster
who
would
show
me
the
best
path
to
the
interior
of
the
island
a
boy
of
ten
was
soon
at
the
child
with
a
great
shock
of
hair
and
legs
disfigured
by
the
scars
of
old
coral
cuts
a
twisting
path
cobbled
and
wide
enough
to
walk
two
abreast
led
us
to
the
summit
the
stones
were
worn
smooth
by
the
passage
of
bare
feet
for
excepting
fish
all
the
food
of
the
village
is
brought
over
this
road
from
the
plantations
to
the
sea
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
ring
of
cliffs
on
which
we
stood
was
an
ancient
reef
in
places
one
could
recognize
the
forms
of
coral
imbedded
with
shells
of
many
varieties
in
the
metamorphosed
rock
here
and
there
one
found
pockets
of
a
material
resembling
marble
veined
and
from
the
coral
by
processes
impossible
to
surmise
the
bulk
of
the
rock
is
the
white
limestone
called
in
the
eastern
pacific
the
level
summit
of
the
cliffs
over
which
in
centuries
gone
by
the
sea
had
washed
and
thundered
forms
a
narrow
plain
sparsely
wooded
and
cultivated
in
spots
where
a
thin
soil
has
gathered
in
the
hollows
we
halted
under
the
palms
crowning
the
inner
brink
the
trail
wound
down
giddily
steep
in
places
that
ladders
had
been
fastened
to
the
rock
to
right
and
left
of
us
the
cliffs
were
sheer
walls
of
limestone
rising
from
a
level
little
above
that
of
the
sea
the
low
hills
of
the
interior
volcanic
and
fern
covered
draining
in
every
direction
toward
the
foot
of
the
have
formed
a
circling
belt
of
swamp
land
on
which
all
the
taro
of
the
island
was
grown
one
could
look
down
on
the
beds
from
where
we
stood
a
mosaic
of
pale
green
laid
out
by
heathen
engineers
in
days
beyond
the
traditions
of
men
another
time
perhaps
i
will
tell
you
of
that
we
climbed
down
the
trail
and
walked
the
dikes
among
the
taro
how
my
escort
increased
to
a
merry
company
as
the
people
began
to
come
after
food
for
the
evening
meal
of
a
boisterous
swim
in
a
pool
beneath
a
waterfall
of
how
i
found
the
remains
of
an
ancient
house
built
of
squared
stone
so
long
ago
that
over
one
end
of
it
the
wooded
earth
lay
two
yards
deep
toward
evening
in
the
bush
at
the
edge
of
the
taro
swamps
i
came
upon
a
large
house
built
of
bamboo
and
pandanus
in
the
native
fashion
a
man
was
standing
framed
in
the
tall
white
man
dressed
in
pajamas
of
silk
his
spectacles
gray
beard
and
expression
of
intelligent
kindliness
were
vaguely
of
place
as
the
cultivated
voice
which
invited
me
to
stop
the
boys
and
girls
escorting
me
squatted
on
their
heels
outside
a
brace
of
pretty
children
shy
and
half
naked
scurried
past
as
i
entered
the
house
my
host
waved
his
hand
toward
a
mat
there
was
only
one
chair
in
the
room
standing
before
a
table
on
which
i
saw
a
small
typewriter
and
a
disordered
heap
of
manuscript
otherwise
the
place
was
unfurnished
except
for
books
ranged
in
crude
bookcases
tier
upon
tier
stacked
here
and
there
in
precarious
piles
standing
in
rows
along
the
floor
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
as
he
offered
me
a
cigarette
from
a
case
of
basketwork
silver
it
is
not
often
that
a
european
passes
my
house
i
shall
not
give
his
name
or
attempt
to
disguise
him
with
a
fictitious
one
it
is
enough
to
say
that
he
is
one
of
the
handful
of
real
scholars
who
have
devoted
their
lives
to
polynesian
research
i
had
read
his
books
published
long
before
and
than
he
still
lived
and
where
he
hid
himself
the
years
of
silence
had
been
spent
he
told
me
in
a
comparative
study
of
the
ocean
dialects
through
which
he
hoped
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
determine
whence
came
the
brown
and
people
of
the
islands
now
with
the
material
in
hand
he
had
chosen
ahu
ahu
as
a
place
of
solitude
where
he
might
complete
his
task
of
compilation
undisturbed
on
the
whole
he
said
with
agreeable
readiness
to
speak
of
his
work
i
am
convinced
that
they
came
from
the
west
the
frenchman
s
theory
that
the
race
originated
in
new
zealand
like
the
belief
that
they
migrated
westward
from
the
shores
of
america
is
more
picturesque
more
stirring
to
the
imagination
but
the
evidence
is
too
vague
if
one
investigates
the
possibilities
of
an
eastward
migration
on
the
other
hand
one
finds
everywhere
in
the
western
islands
the
traces
of
their
passage
far
out
in
the
orient
in
isolated
groups
off
the
coast
of
sumatra
about
java
and
celebes
and
in
the
arafura
sea
i
can
show
you
people
of
the
true
polynesian
type
even
in
such
places
where
the
last
migration
must
have
passed
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
scraps
of
evidence
word
a
curious
custom
the
manner
of
carrying
a
basket
these
things
might
seem
coincidences
if
the
trail
did
not
grow
warmer
as
one
travels
east
though
no
trace
of
their
blood
is
left
new
guinea
must
at
one
time
have
been
a
halting
place
in
the
migration
papua
it
is
called
and
one
finds
the
word
current
in
polynesia
meaning
a
garden
a
rich
land
the
natives
of
new
guinea
are
as
unlike
the
people
of
the
eastern
pacific
i
should
say
as
the
average
american
or
englishman
and
yet
throughout
new
guinea
there
is
a
most
curious
cropping
out
of
polynesian
words
pointing
to
a
very
ancient
intercourse
between
the
races
consider
the
word
for
woman
among
the
polynesians
in
rarotonga
it
is
in
tahiti
in
the
marquesas
in
hawaii
in
samoa
the
same
root
runs
through
the
dialects
of
papua
in
motu
woman
is
in
kerepunu
in
aroma
and
in
motumotu
it
is
which
in
this
part
of
the
pacific
means
variously
female
seed
and
rain
i
could
cite
you
dozens
of
similar
examples
now
and
then
one
comes
across
something
that
sets
one
s
imagination
to
work
as
you
must
know
the
word
for
sun
in
the
islands
is
but
in
tahiti
they
have
another
word
in
new
guinea
hundred
miles
away
and
with
all
melanesia
between
the
tribes
of
the
south
cape
call
the
sun
what
a
puzzle
it
is
though
it
may
be
the
merest
coincidence
that
has
a
flavor
of
egypt
i
wonder
if
there
could
be
a
connection
i
used
to
know
a
girl
in
tahiti
whose
strange
and
rather
beautiful
as
far
back
as
the
records
of
her
family
that
of
a
queen
of
egypt
who
ruled
many
hundreds
of
years
before
christ
but
i
mustn
t
ride
my
hobby
too
fast
it
is
a
pity
you
can
t
stop
on
ahu
ahu
for
a
are
not
many
islands
so
unspoiled
i
ve
grown
very
fond
of
the
place
i
doubt
if
i
ever
leave
it
permanently
if
you
are
interested
in
ghosts
you
had
better
change
your
mind
i
have
a
fine
collection
here
the
house
is
built
on
the
site
of
a
there
is
our
white
rooster
the
spirit
of
an
old
chief
which
appears
during
the
new
harmless
and
friendly
but
the
people
rather
dread
him
then
we
have
a
ghostly
pig
very
bad
indeed
and
a
pair
of
malignant
women
who
walk
about
at
night
with
arms
and
long
hair
entwined
and
are
suspected
of
ghastly
appetites
i
shall
not
say
whether
or
not
i
have
seen
any
of
these
perhaps
it
is
living
too
much
alone
but
i
am
not
so
skeptical
as
i
was
it
was
not
easy
to
part
with
such
a
host
but
the
sun
was
low
over
the
and
the
prospect
of
crossing
the
dikes
among
the
taro
and
scaling
the
cliff
by
dark
drove
me
at
last
to
take
reluctant
leave
lamps
were
shining
in
the
village
when
i
returned
in
some
of
the
houses
i
heard
the
voice
of
the
father
reading
aloud
solemnly
from
the
bible
in
the
native
tongue
in
others
the
people
were
assembled
to
chant
their
savage
and
melancholy
hymns
tari
was
alone
on
the
veranda
smoking
in
his
fashion
and
motioned
me
to
sit
down
beside
him
i
told
him
how
i
had
spent
the
afternoon
when
i
had
finished
he
puffed
on
in
silence
for
a
time
it
is
a
strange
place
ahu
ahu
he
said
at
last
my
has
finished
her
prayers
sung
her
and
put
away
the
family
bible
now
she
has
gone
to
the
house
of
one
of
her
pals
for
a
session
with
old
rakamoana
like
the
land
itself
the
people
are
relics
of
an
elder
heathen
at
heart
memory
of
we
sighted
mauké
at
dawn
the
cabin
lamp
was
still
burning
when
the
boy
brought
my
coffee
i
drank
it
lit
a
cigarette
and
went
on
deck
in
a
the
skipper
himself
was
at
the
wheel
half
a
dozen
men
were
in
the
shrouds
the
native
passengers
were
sitting
forward
in
little
groups
munching
ship
s
biscuit
and
gazing
ahead
for
the
expected
land
the
day
broke
wild
and
gray
with
clouds
scudding
low
over
the
sea
and
squalls
of
rain
since
we
had
left
mangaia
the
day
before
it
had
blown
heavily
from
the
southeast
a
big
sea
was
running
but
in
spite
of
sixty
tons
of
copra
the
schooner
was
reeling
off
the
knots
in
racing
style
running
almost
free
with
the
wind
well
aft
of
the
beam
rising
interminably
on
the
back
of
each
passing
sea
and
taking
the
following
slope
with
a
swoop
and
a
rush
we
had
no
log
it
was
difficult
to
guess
our
position
within
a
dozen
miles
the
low
driving
clouds
surrounding
us
like
a
curtain
made
it
impossible
to
see
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
until
an
observation
could
be
obtained
the
landfall
was
a
matter
of
luck
and
guesswork
our
course
had
been
laid
almost
due
pass
a
little
to
the
west
of
gave
us
the
chance
of
raising
mitiaro
or
atiu
if
we
missed
the
first
island
but
ocean
currents
are
uncertain
things
and
with
a
horizon
limited
to
less
than
half
a
mile
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
slip
past
the
trio
of
low
islands
and
into
the
stretch
of
lonely
ocean
beyond
every
trading
skipper
is
accustomed
to
face
such
situations
one
can
only
maintain
a
sharp
lookout
and
hold
on
one
s
course
until
there
is
an
opportunity
to
use
the
sextant
or
until
it
becomes
obvious
that
the
land
has
been
passed
a
squall
of
rain
drove
down
on
us
for
five
minutes
while
we
shivered
and
the
scuppers
ran
fresh
water
our
narrow
circle
of
vision
was
blotted
out
then
suddenly
with
the
effect
of
a
curtain
drawn
aside
the
clouds
broke
to
the
east
flooding
the
sea
with
light
a
shout
went
up
close
ahead
and
to
starboard
so
near
that
we
could
see
the
white
of
breakers
on
the
reef
was
wooded
to
the
water
s
edge
a
palm
top
rising
here
and
there
above
the
thick
bush
of
iron
woods
next
moment
the
curtain
descended
gray
clouds
and
rearing
seas
surrounded
us
it
was
as
though
we
had
seen
a
vision
of
the
land
unreal
as
the
blue
lakes
seen
at
midday
on
the
desert
but
the
skipper
was
shouting
orders
in
harsh
mangaian
the
schooner
was
swinging
up
into
the
wind
the
blocks
were
clicking
and
purring
as
half
a
dozen
boys
swayed
on
the
mainsheet
presently
the
land
took
vague
form
through
the
mist
of
squalls
we
were
skirting
the
reef
obliquely
drawing
nearer
the
breakers
as
the
settlement
came
in
view
a
narrow
boat
passage
into
which
an
ugly
surf
was
breaching
had
been
blasted
through
the
hard
coral
of
the
reef
a
path
led
up
the
sloping
land
beyond
between
a
double
row
of
canoe
houses
to
the
bush
a
few
people
were
gathering
by
the
canoe
houses
it
was
evident
that
we
had
just
been
sighted
and
that
it
would
be
some
time
before
a
boat
could
put
out
if
indeed
the
boatmen
were
willing
to
risk
the
surf
meanwhile
we
could
only
stand
off
and
on
until
they
came
out
to
us
for
the
skipper
had
no
intention
of
risking
his
ship
s
boat
and
the
lives
of
his
men
on
such
a
forbidding
shore
he
sang
out
dwelling
long
on
the
last
syllable
of
this
cook
island
version
of
hard
alee
the
schooner
rounded
in
to
the
wind
with
a
ponderous
deliberation
calculated
to
make
the
nerves
of
a
sailor
twitch
she
seemed
to
hesitate
like
a
fat
and
fluttering
grandmother
at
last
after
an
age
of
bobbing
and
ducking
into
the
head
sea
while
boom
tackles
were
made
fast
and
headsails
backed
she
made
up
her
mind
and
filled
away
on
the
port
tack
riley
the
american
coconut
planter
who
was
recruiting
labor
for
the
season
on
his
island
turned
to
me
with
a
wink
if
this
old
hooker
was
mine
he
remarked
in
a
voice
meant
to
reach
the
skipper
s
ears
i
d
start
the
engine
every
time
i
came
about
she
can
t
sail
fast
enough
to
keep
steerageway
the
skipper
sniffed
a
british
sniff
they
are
old
friends
if
this
damn
fine
schooner
was
yours
he
observed
without
turning
his
head
she
d
have
been
piled
up
long
as
not
in
broad
daylight
on
an
island
a
thousand
feet
high
riley
chuckled
too
early
for
an
argument
he
said
let
s
go
below
and
have
a
drink
i
have
not
often
run
across
a
more
interesting
man
than
riley
thrown
together
as
he
and
i
have
been
in
circumstances
which
make
for
an
unusual
exchange
of
confidence
i
have
learned
more
of
him
in
two
months
than
one
knows
of
many
an
old
acquaintance
at
home
at
years
of
age
he
is
a
living
object
lesson
for
those
who
bewail
the
old
days
of
adventure
and
romance
and
wish
that
their
lives
had
been
cast
in
other
times
his
blood
is
undiluted
irish
he
has
the
humor
the
imagination
the
quick
sympathy
of
the
race
without
the
irish
heritage
of
instability
born
in
south
boston
and
reared
with
only
the
sketchiest
of
educations
he
set
out
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
at
an
age
when
most
boys
are
playing
marbles
and
looking
forward
with
dread
to
the
study
of
algebra
for
fifteen
years
he
wandered
gathering
a
varied
background
of
experience
he
worked
in
mills
he
drifted
west
and
shipped
as
cabin
boy
on
vessels
plying
the
great
lakes
he
drifted
farther
west
to
become
a
rider
of
the
range
finally
he
reached
san
francisco
and
took
to
the
sea
he
has
been
a
sealer
an
alaska
fisherman
an
seaman
on
sailing
strange
seas
he
has
seen
cape
horn
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
he
speaks
of
the
ports
of
india
china
africa
the
java
sea
as
you
would
speak
of
boston
or
new
york
in
the
days
when
a
line
of
schooners
ran
from
san
francisco
to
tahiti
touching
at
the
marquesas
on
the
way
he
felt
a
call
to
the
south
seas
and
shipped
for
a
round
trip
before
the
mast
when
he
returned
to
san
francisco
a
change
seemed
to
have
come
over
him
the
old
wandering
life
had
lost
its
gone
flat
and
stale
like
many
another
he
had
eaten
of
the
wild
plantain
unaware
the
evenings
of
carousal
ashore
no
longer
tempted
him
even
the
long
afternoons
of
reading
for
reading
has
always
been
this
curious
fellow
s
chief
delight
stretched
on
his
bed
in
a
sailor
s
boarding
house
had
lost
their
print
blurred
before
his
eyes
and
in
its
place
he
saw
lands
of
savage
loveliness
rising
from
a
warm
blue
sea
shadowy
and
mysterious
valleys
strewn
with
the
relics
of
a
forgotten
race
the
dark
eyes
of
a
girl
in
remember
that
riley
was
both
a
sailor
and
an
rough
idealist
keenly
susceptible
to
beauty
and
the
sense
of
romance
it
is
stated
that
the
men
who
live
romance
are
seldom
aware
of
it
this
may
be
true
though
i
doubt
in
riley
s
case
the
theory
does
not
work
out
he
is
the
most
modest
of
men
untainted
by
a
trace
of
egoism
in
his
stories
superbly
told
with
the
irish
gift
for
circumstantial
detail
and
dramatic
effect
the
teller
s
part
is
always
small
and
yet
as
one
listens
thrilled
by
the
color
and
artistry
of
the
tale
one
is
all
the
while
aware
that
this
man
appraises
his
memories
at
their
full
them
with
a
ripened
gusto
an
appreciation
in
short
he
is
one
of
those
fortunate
or
unfortunate
men
for
whom
realities
as
most
of
us
know
them
do
not
exist
men
whose
eyes
are
incapable
of
seeing
drab
or
gray
who
find
mystery
and
fresh
beauty
in
what
we
call
the
commonplace
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
riley
was
aboard
the
next
schooner
bound
south
for
the
islands
nukuhiva
knew
him
for
a
time
but
the
gloom
and
tragedy
of
that
with
an
episode
of
domestic
overpowering
to
a
man
of
his
temperament
from
the
marquesas
he
went
to
tahiti
and
his
wanderings
ended
in
the
cook
group
six
hundred
miles
to
the
west
perhaps
the
finding
of
his
journey
s
end
wrought
the
change
perhaps
it
was
due
to
his
rather
practical
tahitian
any
case
the
wanderer
ceased
to
rove
the
spendthrift
began
to
save
and
plan
in
the
groups
to
the
eastward
he
had
picked
up
a
smattering
of
coconut
lore
it
was
not
long
before
he
got
a
berth
as
superintendent
of
a
small
plantation
with
a
native
wife
and
the
irishman
s
knack
for
languages
he
soon
mastered
the
dialect
of
his
group
he
is
one
of
a
very
few
men
who
speak
it
with
all
the
finer
shadings
this
accounts
in
part
for
his
success
with
chief
difficulty
of
the
planter
throughout
polynesia
to
one
interested
as
i
am
in
the
variations
of
this
oceanic
tongue
it
is
a
genuine
pleasure
to
talk
with
riley
in
school
he
learned
to
read
and
write
beyond
that
he
is
entirely
a
good
half
of
his
earnings
i
should
say
in
the
days
when
he
followed
the
sea
were
spent
on
books
a
native
intelligence
enabled
him
to
criticize
and
select
he
has
read
enormously
and
what
he
has
read
he
has
remembered
each
time
a
new
subject
attracted
him
he
hastened
to
the
book
shops
of
san
francisco
or
liverpool
or
singapore
and
gathered
a
little
forecastle
library
of
reference
like
most
intelligent
men
in
this
part
of
the
world
he
has
grown
interested
in
the
subject
of
polynesian
research
it
is
odd
to
hear
him
a
strong
accent
of
south
boston
and
the
manner
of
a
professor
of
question
of
maori
chronology
or
the
variations
in
a
causative
prefix
once
he
made
clear
to
me
a
matter
often
referred
to
in
print
but
which
i
had
never
properly
understood
he
was
speaking
of
the
language
of
tahiti
when
you
hear
a
tahitian
talk
he
said
it
sounds
different
but
really
it
s
the
same
as
hawaiian
or
marquesan
or
rarotongan
or
new
zealand
maori
tahiti
is
the
oldest
settled
place
and
the
language
has
kind
of
rotted
away
there
nowadays
the
tahitian
has
lost
the
strong
harsh
sounds
of
the
old
lingo
the
and
in
place
of
them
there
is
simply
a
catch
between
two
vowels
if
you
know
rarotongan
and
understand
the
system
of
change
you
can
get
on
all
right
in
tahiti
take
our
word
play
a
musical
instrument
means
wail
or
weep
is
the
old
causative
prefix
the
combination
means
cause
to
now
let
s
figure
that
word
out
in
tahitian
first
we
ve
got
to
take
out
the
and
that
leaves
a
bad
doesn
t
sound
good
so
the
tahitians
stick
on
an
at
the
beginning
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
ata
is
the
word
it
makes
me
laugh
to
think
of
when
i
first
came
down
here
i
was
working
in
tahiti
and
when
i
came
home
in
the
evening
my
girl
would
look
up
from
her
sewing
and
sing
out
o
riley
for
the
love
of
mike
i
d
tell
her
don
t
you
know
my
name
yet
it
s
riley
not
o
riley
finally
i
caught
on
i
d
been
fooled
on
the
same
proposition
as
cook
and
all
the
rest
of
them
you
remember
they
called
the
island
otahiti
that
o
is
simply
a
special
form
of
the
verb
used
before
personal
pronouns
and
proper
nouns
the
old
navigators
when
the
canoes
came
out
to
meet
them
pointed
to
the
land
and
asked
its
name
o
tahiti
said
the
natives
it
is
tahiti
my
girl
didn
t
mean
to
call
me
o
riley
at
all
she
was
simply
saying
it
s
a
serious
white
man
particularly
when
he
is
able
to
recruit
and
handle
native
labor
is
always
in
demand
in
the
islands
it
was
not
long
before
riley
s
talents
were
recognized
now
he
is
manager
and
part
owner
of
an
entire
atoll
i
have
listened
with
a
great
deal
of
interest
to
his
accounts
of
the
life
there
every
year
at
about
christmas
time
a
schooner
comes
to
load
his
copra
and
take
his
boys
back
to
their
respective
islands
not
a
soul
is
left
on
the
atoll
riley
boards
the
schooner
with
his
wife
and
takes
passage
to
papeete
for
a
couple
of
months
of
civilization
when
the
time
is
up
he
makes
a
tour
of
the
cook
group
to
recruit
twenty
or
thirty
boys
for
the
new
season
and
is
landed
on
his
island
with
a
nine
months
supply
of
medicine
provisions
and
reading
matter
he
is
the
only
white
man
on
the
atoll
one
would
suppose
such
a
life
deadly
monotonous
and
lonely
but
just
now
he
is
pining
to
get
back
it
is
really
the
pleasantest
of
lives
he
says
enough
routine
in
keeping
the
men
properly
at
work
superb
fishing
when
one
desires
a
touch
of
sport
plenty
of
time
to
read
and
think
the
healthiest
climate
in
the
world
and
a
bit
of
trouble
now
and
then
to
give
the
spice
a
true
irishman
needs
riley
is
a
man
of
medium
size
with
thick
brown
hair
and
eyes
of
celtic
dark
blue
perpetually
sparkling
with
humor
i
have
never
seen
a
stronger
or
more
active
man
of
his
weight
on
his
atoll
he
spends
an
hour
every
day
in
exercise
running
jumping
working
with
dumbbells
and
indian
clubs
from
head
to
foot
he
is
burnt
a
deep
ruddy
full
shade
darker
than
the
tint
of
his
native
wife
sometimes
he
says
he
works
himself
into
such
a
pink
of
condition
that
he
aches
to
pick
a
fight
with
the
first
comer
but
i
fancy
he
finds
trouble
enough
to
satisfy
another
man
once
a
huge
sullen
fellow
from
the
gambier
group
attempted
to
spear
him
and
riley
called
all
of
his
men
in
from
their
work
appointed
the
foreman
referee
and
beat
the
native
fierce
and
lithe
and
strong
as
a
and
scientifically
to
a
pulp
on
another
occasion
a
boy
from
a
island
of
the
southern
paumotus
took
a
grudge
against
the
manager
and
bided
his
time
with
the
cunning
of
a
wild
animal
the
chance
came
one
afternoon
when
riley
was
asleep
in
the
shade
behind
his
house
the
paumotan
stole
up
with
a
club
and
put
him
still
sounder
asleep
with
a
blow
on
the
head
that
laid
his
scalp
open
and
nearly
fractured
his
skull
half
a
dozen
kicks
from
the
ball
of
a
toughened
foot
stove
in
the
ribs
on
one
side
of
his
chest
with
that
the
native
left
his
victim
very
likely
thinking
him
dead
riley
s
wife
from
whom
i
got
the
story
was
asleep
in
the
house
at
the
time
toward
evening
she
went
to
look
for
her
husband
and
found
him
stretched
out
bloody
and
unconscious
on
the
sand
in
spite
of
her
kind
are
not
much
use
in
a
managed
to
get
him
to
the
house
and
revive
him
riley
s
first
act
was
to
drink
half
a
tumbler
of
whisky
his
second
to
send
for
the
foreman
the
paumotan
boy
had
disappeared
overcome
by
forebodings
of
evil
he
had
taken
a
canoe
and
paddled
off
to
hide
himself
on
an
uncleared
islet
across
the
lagoon
riley
gave
the
foreman
careful
instructions
early
in
the
morning
he
was
to
take
all
the
boys
and
spend
the
day
if
necessary
in
running
down
the
fugitive
who
under
no
circumstances
was
to
be
injured
or
roughly
handled
they
brought
the
boy
in
at
afraid
at
first
sullen
and
relieved
when
he
learned
his
punishment
was
no
worse
than
to
stand
up
to
the
manager
before
the
assembled
plantation
hands
it
must
have
been
a
grievous
affair
tetua
could
scarcely
describe
it
without
tears
riley
was
still
sick
and
dizzy
his
ribs
were
taped
so
tightly
that
he
could
breathe
with
only
half
his
lungs
and
a
strip
of
plaster
covered
the
wound
on
his
head
the
paumotan
was
fresh
and
unhurt
he
outweighed
his
antagonist
by
twenty
pounds
and
fought
with
confidence
and
bitterness
the
kanaka
is
certainly
among
the
strongest
men
of
the
world
a
formidable
adversary
in
a
fight
it
went
badly
with
riley
for
a
time
the
boy
nearly
threw
him
and
a
blow
on
his
broken
ribs
almost
made
him
faint
but
in
the
by
pain
and
the
thought
of
the
treacherous
got
his
man
down
and
might
have
killed
him
if
the
foreman
and
half
a
dozen
others
had
not
intervened
riley
s
island
is
a
true
broad
lagoon
inclosed
by
an
oval
sweep
of
reef
along
which
are
scattered
islets
of
varying
size
many
people
must
have
lived
on
it
in
the
past
everywhere
there
are
traces
of
man
s
occupation
a
dozen
inhabitants
were
there
within
the
memory
of
living
men
but
the
dead
outnumbered
the
living
too
place
became
unbearable
to
them
and
in
the
end
a
schooner
took
them
away
the
outlying
cook
islands
are
places
full
of
interest
i
determined
when
i
began
this
letter
to
give
you
a
real
account
of
island
itself
its
people
the
number
of
tons
of
copra
produced
annually
and
other
enlightening
information
but
somehow
when
one
begins
to
write
of
this
part
of
the
world
it
seems
a
hopeless
task
to
stick
to
a
train
of
are
too
many
diverging
lines
of
fancy
too
many
intangible
stimuli
to
thought
stirring
to
the
imagination

was
a
ticklish
business
like
mangaia
mitiaro
and
atiu
this
island
is
of
mixed
volcanic
and
pinnacle
of
a
submerged
peak
ringed
with
millions
of
tons
of
coral
and
without
any
lagoon
worthy
of
the
name
the
polyps
have
built
a
sort
of
platform
around
the
land
low
inshore
and
seems
usually
the
before
it
drops
off
into
the
sea
breaching
across
the
outer
ridge
the
surf
fills
a
narrow
belt
of
shallows
between
it
and
the
shore
the
result
is
a
miniature
edition
of
a
place
of
rocky
pools
where
children
wade
on
the
lookout
for
crayfish
and
baby
octopus
on
the
outer
edge
the
reef
is
steep
too
dropping
off
almost
at
the
perpendicular
it
is
difficult
to
realize
when
one
has
been
brought
up
on
the
friendly
coasts
of
america
that
if
a
boat
capsizes
off
these
reefs
one
must
swim
offshore
and
wait
to
be
picked
it
is
wiser
to
chance
the
sharks
than
to
attempt
a
landing
in
the
surf
for
the
sea
is
breaking
along
the
summit
of
a
sunken
and
sharp
as
broken
glass
poisonous
as
the
venom
of
a
snake
they
came
out
to
us
in
a
whaleboat
riley
the
supercargo
and
i
were
the
first
to
go
ashore
as
we
pulled
away
from
the
schooner
a
argument
began
one
of
the
principal
men
of
the
island
had
come
out
as
a
passenger
and
was
sitting
beside
me
he
insisted
that
as
they
had
got
off
safely
from
the
boat
passage
it
was
best
to
return
the
same
way
the
boat
steerer
disagreed
it
was
all
very
well
to
put
out
from
the
passage
with
a
score
of
men
to
hold
the
boat
until
the
moment
came
and
launch
her
out
to
the
breakers
but
now
the
situation
was
different
the
passage
was
narrow
it
must
be
entered
just
so
and
a
mishap
might
have
unpleasant
consequences
in
such
a
surf
the
steersman
had
the
best
of
it
he
took
us
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
the
passage
and
let
his
men
rest
on
their
oars
off
a
place
where
the
reef
seemed
a
little
lower
than
elsewhere
each
time
we
swung
up
to
the
crest
of
a
swell
i
got
a
look
at
the
surf
and
the
prospect
was
not
reassuring
once
or
twice
as
the
backwash
poured
off
in
a
frothy
cascade
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
jagged
and
forbidding
little
by
little
we
drew
near
the
land
until
the
boat
lay
just
where
the
waves
began
to
tower
for
the
final
rush
the
oarsmen
backed
water
boat
steerer
turned
his
head
nervously
this
way
and
that
glancing
at
the
reef
ahead
and
at
the
rearing
water
behind
i
thought
of
a
day
many
years
before
when
my
father
had
taken
me
for
a
first
experience
of
the
chutes
and
our
little
boat
seemed
to
pause
for
an
instant
at
the
summit
of
the
tower
before
it
tilted
forward
and
flew
down
the
steep
slope
to
the
far
off
and
below
the
feeling
was
the
mingling
with
delight
an
almost
painful
exhilaration
all
of
us
saving
the
watchful
figure
in
the
stern
were
waiting
for
a
signal
which
would
make
the
oarsmen
leap
into
activity
the
passengers
clench
their
teeth
and
grip
the
rail
suddenly
it
harsh
shout
six
oars
struck
the
water
at
once
the
whaleboat
gathered
way
a
big
sea
rose
behind
us
lifted
us
gently
on
its
back
and
swept
us
toward
the
reef
next
moment
i
saw
that
we
had
started
a
breath
too
late
we
were
going
like
the
wind
it
was
true
but
not
tilted
forward
on
the
crest
as
we
should
have
been
the
wave
was
gradually
passing
beneath
us
riley
glanced
at
me
and
shook
his
head
with
a
humorous
turndown
of
the
mouth
it
was
too
late
to
men
were
pulling
desperately
their
long
oars
bending
at
every
stroke
when
the
sea
broke
we
were
slipping
down
into
the
trough
behind
as
we
passed
over
the
edge
of
the
reef
the
wave
was
beginning
its
backward
wash
there
were
shouts
i
found
myself
up
to
my
waist
in
a
foaming
rush
of
water
struggling
with
might
and
main
to
keep
my
footing
and
to
hold
the
boat
from
slipping
off
into
the
sea
we
stopped
her
just
on
the
brink
her
keel
grated
on
the
coral
another
sea
was
coming
at
us
towering
high
above
our
heads
riley
the
supercargo
and
i
leaped
aboard
in
response
to
a
sharp
command
the
boys
held
her
to
the
last
as
they
scrambled
over
the
sides
the
sea
caught
us
half
swamping
the
boat
and
lifting
her
stern
high
in
the
air
she
tilted
wildly
as
her
bow
crashed
on
the
coral
but
a
rare
piece
of
luck
saved
her
from
turning
broadside
on
next
moment
we
were
over
the
reef
and
gliding
smoothly
into
the
shallow
water
beyond
as
i
drew
a
long
satisfying
breath
i
heard
riley
chuckle
i
think
i
ll
get
a
job
diving
for
shell
he
remarked
i
ll
swear
i
haven
t
breathed
for
a
good
three
minutes
when
we
stood
on
the
beach
a
dozen
men
came
forward
smiling
to
greet
their
friend
rairi
with
a
decently
pronounceable
the
native
has
got
off
easily
i
never
tire
of
wondering
what
these
people
will
call
a
white
man
they
seem
to
prefer
the
surname
if
it
can
be
pronounced
if
not
they
try
the
given
name
and
charley
becomes
teari
or
johnny
tioni
if
this
fails
or
if
they
take
a
dislike
to
one
the
fun
begins
i
have
a
friend
who
unless
he
leaves
the
islands
will
be
called
salt
pork
all
his
life
and
i
know
another
colonial
of
the
intolerant
goes
blissfully
about
his
business
all
unaware
that
hundreds
of
people
know
him
by
no
other
name
than
pig
dung
no
doubt
you
have
noticed
another
thing
down
deceptive
simplicity
of
address
in
these
eastern
islands
the
humblest
speaks
to
the
most
powerful
without
any
title
of
respect
with
nothing
corresponding
to
our
mister
or
sir
at
first
one
is
inclined
to
believe
that
here
is
the
beautiful
and
ideal
realization
of
the
communist
s
there
are
other
things
which
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
servants
for
one
example
are
treated
with
extraordinary
consideration
and
kindliness
when
the
feast
is
over
the
mistress
of
the
household
is
apt
as
not
to
dance
with
the
man
who
feeds
her
pigs
or
the
head
of
the
family
to
take
the
arm
of
the
girl
who
has
been
waiting
on
his
guests
the
truth
is
that
this
impression
of
equality
is
false
there
are
not
many
places
in
the
world
where
a
more
rigid
social
order
of
caste
but
of
classes
in
the
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
years
that
they
have
inhabited
the
islands
the
polynesians
have
worked
out
a
system
of
human
relationships
nearer
the
ultimate
perhaps
than
our
own
idealists
would
have
us
believe
wealth
counts
for
little
birth
for
everything
it
is
useless
for
an
islander
to
think
of
raising
himself
in
a
social
he
is
born
he
dies
and
his
children
after
him
on
the
other
hand
except
for
the
abstract
pleasure
of
position
there
is
little
to
make
the
small
man
envious
of
the
great
he
eats
the
same
food
his
dress
is
the
same
he
works
as
little
or
as
much
and
the
relations
between
the
two
are
of
the
pleasantest
there
is
a
really
charming
lack
of
ostentation
in
these
islands
where
everything
is
known
about
everyone
and
it
is
useless
to
pretend
to
be
what
one
is
not
that
is
at
the
root
of
it
is
one
place
in
the
world
at
least
where
every
man
is
sure
of
himself
we
were
strolling
up
the
path
between
the
canoe
houses
when
riley
stopped
me
come
and
have
a
look
he
said
this
is
the
only
island
i
know
of
where
you
can
see
an
double
canoe
there
were
two
of
them
in
the
shed
we
entered
under
a
roof
of
battered
galvanized
graceful
hulls
fashioned
from
the
trunks
of
trees
joined
in
pairs
by
timbers
of
ironwood
laid
across
the
gunwales
and
lashed
down
with
sinnet
they
were
beautifully
smooth
and
decorated
with
carving
in
these
craft
my
companion
told
me
the
men
of
mauké
still
voyage
to
atiu
and
mitiaro
as
they
had
done
for
generations
before
cook
sailed
through
the
group
there
is
an
ancient
feud
between
mauké
and
atiu
it
is
curious
how
hard
such
grudges
die
the
men
of
atiu
were
the
most
warlike
of
all
the
cook
islanders
even
in
these
times
of
traders
and
schools
and
missionaries
no
firearms
are
allowed
on
the
island
time
after
time
in
the
old
days
they
raided
mauké
stealing
by
night
upon
the
sleeping
villages
entering
each
house
to
feel
the
heads
of
the
sleepers
when
they
felt
the
large
head
of
a
warrior
they
seized
his
throat
and
killed
him
without
noise
the
children
and
small
heads
and
the
heads
with
long
taken
back
alive
to
atiu
terrible
scenes
have
been
enacted
under
the
old
ironwoods
of
mauké
when
the
raiders
maddened
with
the
heat
of
killing
danced
in
the
firelight
about
the
opened
ovens
and
gorged
on
the
bodies
of
the
slain
for
the
excepting
perhaps
the
people
of
aitutaki
were
cannibals
as
fierce
as
the
maoris
of
new
zealand
or
the
tawny
savages
of
the
marquesas
why
should
aitutaki
have
bred
a
gentler
and
finer
people
the
group
is
not
widely
scattered
as
islands
go
there
must
have
been
fighting
and
intermarriage
for
ages
past
yet
any
man
who
has
been
here
long
can
tell
you
at
a
glance
from
which
island
a
native
hails
even
after
my
few
weeks
i
am
beginning
to
have
an
eye
for
the
differences
the
mangaian
is
certainly
the
most
distinct
recognizable
at
once
by
his
dark
skin
his
wide
ugly
mouth
his
uncouth
and
savage
manner
the
rarotongan
who
will
soon
be
a
rarity
is
another
in
a
leonine
way
with
less
energy
and
far
more
dignity
of
presence
the
people
of
aitutaki
are
different
as
the
average
tahitian
and
pleasing
in
features
and
manner
i
have
seen
girls
from
that
island
who
would
be
called
beautiful
in
any
country
these
differences
are
not
easy
to
account
for
it
seems
to
me
when
one
considers
that
the
islanders
are
all
of
one
race
tracing
their
ancestry
back
to
common
sources
and
speaking
a
common
tongue
the
trader
a
friend
of
riley
s
took
us
to
his
house
for
lunch
the
day
was
sunday
and
a
feast
was
already
preparing
so
we
were
spared
the
vocal
agonies
of
the
pig
times
must
be
have
seen
very
few
traders
of
the
type
one
expects
to
find
in
the
south
seas
nowadays
they
seem
to
be
rather
quiet
reflective
men
who
like
to
read
and
play
their
phonographs
in
the
evening
and
drink
excellent
whisky
with
soda
from
a
sparklet
bottle
this
one
was
no
exception
i
found
him
full
of
intelligence
and
a
dreamy
philosophy
which
kept
him
content
in
this
forgotten
corner
of
the
world
he
was
young
and
english
there
were
cricket
bats
and
blazers
in
his
living
room
and
shelves
filled
with
the
kind
of
books
one
can
read
over
and
over
again
he
was
pessimistic
over
riley
s
chances
of
getting
people
of
mauké
were
growing
lazier
each
year
he
said
and
seemed
to
get
along
with
less
and
less
of
the
european
things
for
which
at
one
time
they
had
worked
as
for
copra
they
no
longer
bothered
much
with
it
the
nuts
were
left
to
sprout
under
the
palms
the
taro
patches
were
running
down
the
coffee
and
breadfruit
dropped
off
the
trees
unpicked
the
oranges
which
brought
a
good
price
when
a
vessel
came
to
take
them
off
were
allowed
to
drop
and
rot
as
we
sat
smoking
after
lunch
a
native
boy
came
in
with
a
vague
air
of
conspiracy
to
hold
a
whispered
conversation
with
riley
when
he
had
gone
the
american
winked
at
our
host
and
turned
to
me
there
s
a
beer
tub
going
full
blast
out
in
the
bush
he
said
i
think
i
ll
drop
in
on
them
and
see
if
i
can
pick
up
a
man
or
two
you
d
better
come
along
liquor
is
prohibited
to
the
natives
throughout
the
cook
islands
even
the
white
man
must
buy
it
from
the
government
in
quantities
regulated
by
the
judgment
of
the
official
in
charge
the
manufacture
of
anything
alcoholic
is
forbidden
but
this
latter
law
is
administered
with
a
certain
degree
of
tolerance
fortunately
for
everyone
concerned
the
art
of
making
palm
toddy
has
never
been
introduced
when
the
feels
the
need
of
mild
exhilaration
he
takes
to
the
bush
and
brews
a
beverage
known
as
orange
beer
the
ingredients
are
sugar
orange
juice
and
recipe
would
prove
popular
i
fancy
in
our
own
states
the
story
goes
that
when
the
cook
island
boys
went
overseas
to
war
they
found
a
great
drought
prevailing
in
their
eastern
field
of
i
think
it
was
but
there
were
oranges
in
plenty
and
these
untutored
islanders
soon
showed
the
tommies
a
trick
that
brought
them
together
like
brothers
i
have
tasted
orange
beer
at
all
stages
even
the
rare
old
vintage
stuff
bottled
two
or
three
months
before
and
found
it
not
at
all
difficult
to
take
there
are
worse
varieties
of
tipple
though
this
one
is
apt
to
lead
to
fighting
and
leaves
its
devotee
with
a
headache
of
unusual
severity
we
found
fifteen
or
twenty
men
assembled
under
an
old
utu
tree
a
dance
ended
as
we
drew
near
and
the
cup
was
being
passed
two
kerosene
tins
with
the
tops
cut
off
and
filled
with
the
beer
stood
in
the
center
of
the
group
women
are
never
present
on
these
occasions
which
correspond
in
a
way
to
saturday
evenings
in
a
club
at
home
a
sort
of
rude
relic
perhaps
of
observed
around
the
beer
tub
the
oldest
man
present
armed
with
a
heavy
stick
is
appointed
guardian
of
the
peace
to
see
that
decency
and
order
are
preserved
the
natives
realize
no
doubt
that
any
serious
disturbance
might
put
an
end
to
their
fun
the
single
cup
is
filled
and
passed
to
each
guest
in
turn
he
must
empty
it
without
taking
breath
after
every
round
one
of
the
drinkers
is
expected
to
rise
and
entertain
the
company
with
a
dance
or
a
song
riley
was
welcomed
with
shouts
he
was
in
a
gay
mood
and
when
we
had
had
our
turns
at
the
cup
he
stripped
off
his
tunic
for
a
dance
he
is
a
famous
dancer
unhampered
by
the
native
conventions
he
went
through
the
figures
of
and
the
man
s
part
then
the
woman
the
men
of
mauké
clapped
their
hands
rhythmically
and
choked
with
laughter
no
wonder
riley
gets
on
with
the
people
there
is
not
an
ounce
of
in
enters
into
a
bit
of
fun
with
the
abandon
of
a
child
as
for
dancing
he
is
wonderful
every
posture
was
there
every
twist
and
wriggle
and
flutter
of
the
old
bligh
called
with
delightful
righteous
gusto
the
wanton
gestures
of
the
riley
had
told
his
friends
on
the
beach
that
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
labor
by
this
time
probably
the
whole
island
knew
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
atoll
and
that
he
needed
men
before
we
took
leave
of
the
drinkers
three
of
them
had
agreed
to
go
with
my
companion
the
sea
was
calmer
now
and
since
riley
s
wife
was
on
the
schooner
we
decided
to
go
aboard
for
dinner
four
more
recruits
were
waiting
by
the
canoe
houses
to
sign
was
odd
to
see
their
response
to
the
irishman
s
casual
offer
when
half
the
planters
of
the
group
declare
that
labor
is
unobtainable
the
whaleboat
was
waiting
in
the
passage
it
was
evening
the
wind
had
dropped
the
sky
overhead
was
darkening
out
to
the
west
the
sun
had
set
behind
banks
of
white
cloud
rimmed
with
gold
the
oarsmen
took
their
places
friendly
hands
shot
us
out
in
a
lull
between
two
breakers
we
passed
the
surf
and
pulled
offshore
toward
where
the
schooner
was
riding
an
easy
swell
her
lights
beginning
to
twinkle
in
the
dusk
illustration
woodcut
chance
began
to
move
of
set
purpose
in
papeete
on
the
day
i
was
to
sail
with
the
schooner
for
the
cloud
of
islands
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
water
front
and
having
plenty
of
time
walked
leisurely
thinking
of
the
long
journey
so
nearly
at
hand
of
the
strange
and
lonely
islands
i
was
to
see
and
wondering
as
an
must
when
presented
with
a
piece
of
good
fortune
what
i
had
done
to
merit
it
oro
the
cabin
boy
of
the
was
following
with
my
luggage
he
kept
at
some
distance
a
mark
of
respect
as
i
thought
until
i
saw
him
sublet
his
contract
to
a
smaller
boy
then
he
retired
to
spend
the
unearned
increment
in
watermelon
and
a
variety
of
cakes
sold
at
the
chinese
stalls
along
the
street
not
wanting
him
to
think
that
i
begrudged
him
his
last
little
fling
on
shore
i
became
interested
of
a
sudden
in
the
contents
of
a
shop
window
and
there
i
saw
a
boxful
of
marbles
in
a
moment
oro
was
forgotten
papeete
faded
from
view
and
the
warm
air
fragrant
with
the
odors
of
vanilla
and
roasting
coffee
became
more
bracing
there
was
a
tang
in
it
like
that
of
early
april
in
iowa
for
example
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
fifteen
years
dropped
lightly
from
my
shoulders
and
i
was
back
at
the
old
rendezvous
in
the
imagination
almost
as
really
as
i
had
ever
been
in
the
flesh
the
lumber
yard
of
brown
son
lay
on
the
right
hand
and
the
rock
island
railroad
tracks
on
the
left
between
on
a
stretch
of
smooth
cinder
right
of
way
a
dozen
games
were
in
full
swing
there
were
cries
of
picks
and
vents
bunchers
sneakers
knucks
down
the
sharp
crack
of
expert
shots
the
crunch
of
cinders
under
bare
and
yet
tender
feet
meadow
larks
were
singing
in
a
nearby
pasture
and
from
afar
i
heard
the
deep
whistle
of
the
rocky
mountain
limited
as
it
came
down
the
mitchellville
grade
i
bought
the
whole
box
of
them
they
cost
fifty
francs
about
four
dollars
american
as
the
exchange
was
then
but
i
considered
the
investment
a
good
one
i
knew
that
no
matter
where
i
might
be
to
lift
the
lid
of
my
box
was
to
make
an
immediate
and
inexpensive
journey
back
to
one
of
the
pleasantest
periods
of
boyhood
oro
was
awaiting
me
at
the
quay
and
carried
my
small
sea
chest
on
board
with
an
air
of
spurious
fatigue
i
gave
him
my
purchase
and
told
him
to
stow
it
away
for
me
in
the
cabin
which
he
did
with
such
care
that
i
did
not
find
it
again
until
we
were
within
view
of
rutiaro
the
was
homeward
bound
then
from
tanao
where
we
had
left
crichton
the
english
planter
rutiaro
lying
on
our
course
it
was
decided
to
put
in
there
in
the
hope
that
we
might
be
able
to
replace
our
lost
deck
cargo
of
copra
washed
overboard
in
a
squall
a
few
days
previously
neither
findlay
s
pacific
nor
the
admiralty
sailing
had
much
to
say
about
the
atoll
both
agreed
that
the
lagoon
is
nine
miles
long
by
five
broad
and
that
on
june
the
french
surveying
vessel
found
the
tide
running
through
a
narrow
pass
at
two
knots
per
hour
the
flood
as
swift
as
the
ebb
it
was
further
stated
that
in
her
majesty
s
ship
anchored
in
eight
fathoms
three
hundred
yards
from
shore
in
front
of
the
village
which
is
situated
on
the
most
westerly
island
and
that
a
few
pigs
and
chickens
were
purchased
at
a
nominal
price
from
the
inhabitants
with
this
information
i
had
to
be
content
in
so
far
as
my
reading
was
concerned
there
was
nothing
of
a
later
date
in
either
volume
and
the
impression
i
had
was
that
the
atoll
having
been
charted
and
briefly
described
had
remained
unvisited
almost
forgotten
for
a
period
of
years
this
of
course
was
not
the
case
tinned
beef
and
kerosene
oil
had
followed
the
flag
there
as
elsewhere
in
the
world
religion
in
fact
had
preceded
it
leaving
a
broad
wake
of
bibles
and
black
still
in
evidence
among
the
older
generation
but
skippers
of
small
trading
schooners
are
rarely
correspondents
of
the
hydrographic
associations
and
the
reports
from
the
field
of
itinerant
missionaries
are
buried
in
the
dusty
files
of
the
religious
journals
so
that
rutiaro
is
as
little
known
to
the
world
at
large
as
it
has
always
been
findlay
s
general
remarks
about
it
were
confined
to
a
single
sentence
a
lonely
atoll
numbering
a
population
of
between
and
one
hundred
inhabitants
it
certainly
looked
lonely
enough
on
the
chart
far
out
on
the
westerly
fringe
of
the
archipelago
more
than
six
hundred
miles
from
the
nearest
steamship
route
and
that
one
infrequently
traveled
i
sought
further
information
from
the
supercargo
a
american
despite
his
tahitian
name
he
had
been
trading
in
the
low
islands
for
twenty
years
and
during
that
time
had
created
a
voluminous
literature
with
reference
to
their
inhabitants
but
it
was
all
of
an
occupational
nature
and
confined
to
the
ledgers
of
the
trading
company
i
found
him
at
his
usual
task
in
the
cabin
where
he
gave
me
some
specimen
compositions
for
criticism
i
wish
you
d
look
them
over
he
said
these
copra
bugs
drive
a
man
wild
they
get
in
your
eyes
in
your
liquor
in
your
what
a
life
the
cabin
was
filled
with
unsacked
copra
to
the
level
of
the
upper
tier
of
bunks
one
had
to
crawl
in
on
hands
and
knees
the
copra
bugs
were
something
of
a
nuisance
and
the
smell
and
heat
oppressive
i
had
traveled
on
more
comfortable
vessels
with
tennis
courts
on
the
boat
decks
and
roman
swimming
baths
they
didn
t
touch
at
rutiaro
i
went
through
his
accounts
verifying
long
lists
of
items
such
as
to
terii
tuahu
dozen
beacon
lanterns
at
frs
to
ohiti
poene
sacks
flour
frs
to
low
hung
chin
gross
flash
lamps
frs
frs
the
work
of
checking
up
finished
we
went
out
for
a
breath
of
air
the
atoll
lay
abeam
and
still
far
distant
a
faint
bluish
haze
lifted
a
bare
eighth
of
an
inch
above
the
circle
of
the
horizon
behind
us
rain
fell
in
a
straight
wall
of
water
from
a
single
black
cloud
which
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
path
we
had
come
elsewhere
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
sea
the
incredible
blue
of
the
tropics
tino
broke
a
long
silence
look
here
he
said
what
is
it
that
interests
you
in
these
islands
i
ve
never
known
anyone
to
visit
them
for
pleasure
before
is
it
the
women
or
what
under
pressure
i
admitted
that
nature
seemed
to
have
spent
her
best
effort
among
the
paumotuans
in
fashioning
the
men
you
re
right
said
tino
the
women
are
healthy
enough
of
course
but
they
don
t
set
your
heart
beating
a
hundred
to
the
minute
they
have
fine
hands
and
white
teeth
and
you
won
t
find
such
black
hair
in
all
the
world
as
you
find
in
these
atolls
but
that
s
the
size
of
it
you
can
t
praise
them
any
further
for
looks
maybe
you
haven
t
noticed
their
ears
because
they
always
cover
them
up
with
their
hair
but
they
re
large
and
their
feet
and
as
sole
leather
and
all
scarred
over
with
coral
cuts
that
is
well
enough
for
the
men
but
with
the
women
it
s
different
makes
you
lose
your
enthusiasm
don
t
it
i
had
seen
a
good
many
striking
exceptions
in
our
wanderings
but
i
agreed
that
in
the
main
what
he
said
was
true
well
if
it
isn
t
the
women
what
else
is
there
to
be
interested
in
not
the
islands
themselves
lord
when
you
ve
seen
one
you
ve
seen
the
lot
living
on
one
of
them
is
like
living
aboard
ship
not
room
to
stretch
your
legs
they
re
solid
enough
and
they
don
t
sink
but
in
a
hurricane
i
d
a
heap
rather
take
my
chances
out
to
sea
with
the
than
to
be
lashed
to
the
stoutest
coconut
tree
in
the
whole
group
now
you
take
rutiaro
it
was
washed
over
seventeen
years
ago
and
all
but
twenty
of
the
people
killed
they
are
back
to
now
but
wait
till
the
next
bad
blow
down
that
way
they
ll
drown
like
rats
just
as
they
did
before
well
we
won
t
have
to
stop
long
he
added
grouchily
i
ll
take
what
copra
they
have
and
get
out
it
s
a
hole
they
only
make
about
tons
a
year
the
island
could
produce
three
times
that
amount
under
decent
management
they
re
a
lazy
independent
lot
at
rutiaro
you
can
t
get
em
to
stir
themselves
i
asked
him
what
they
had
to
gain
by
stirring
themselves
gain
he
said
they
have
everything
to
gain
there
are
only
two
frame
houses
on
the
place
the
rest
of
them
are
miserable
little
shelters
of
coconut
thatch
i
haven
t
sold
them
enough
corrugated
iron
in
ten
years
to
cover
this
cockpit
you
remember
takaroa
and
niau
and
fakahina
well
there
s
my
idea
of
islands
nice
european
beds
center
tables
phonographs
a
further
catalogue
of
the
comforts
and
conveniences
of
civilization
which
the
inhabitants
of
rutiaro
might
have
and
didn
t
convinced
me
that
this
was
the
atoll
i
had
been
looking
for
and
i
regretted
that
our
stay
there
was
to
be
so
brief
i
did
not
begrudge
the
inhabitants
of
richer
atolls
their
phonographs
and
bicycles
they
got
an
incredible
amount
of
amusement
out
of
them
listened
with
delight
to
the
strange
music
and
spent
entire
evenings
taking
turns
with
the
bicycles
riding
them
back
and
forth
from
the
lagoon
beach
to
the
ocean
shore
but
the
frame
houses
were
blots
on
the
landscape
crude
barnlike
structures
most
of
them
which
offend
the
eye
like
factory
chimneys
in
a
green
valley
rutiaro
had
none
of
these
things
and
having
no
interest
in
it
from
the
commercial
point
of
view
i
awaited
impatiently
our
arrival
there
at
ten
o
clock
we
were
three
miles
to
windward
of
the
village
island
it
lay
at
the
narrower
end
of
the
lagoon
the
inner
shore
line
curving
around
a
broad
indentation
where
the
village
was
the
land
narrowed
in
one
direction
to
a
ledge
of
reef
at
the
farther
end
there
was
a
small
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
in
length
by
one
hundred
broad
separated
from
the
main
island
by
a
strip
of
shallow
water
seen
from
aloft
the
two
islands
resembled
roughly
in
outline
an
vessel
with
a
small
boat
in
tow
i
could
see
the
whole
of
the
atoll
from
the
mainmast
crosstrees
the
lagoon
shimmering
into
green
over
the
shoals
darkening
to
an
intense
blue
over
unlit
valleys
of
ocean
floor
a
solitude
of
sunlit
water
placid
as
a
lake
buried
in
the
depths
of
inaccessible
mountains
i
followed
the
shore
line
with
my
glasses
distant
islands
ledges
of
barren
reef
leaped
forward
with
an
effect
of
magic
as
though
our
atom
of
a
vessel
the
only
sail
which
relieved
the
emptiness
of
the
sea
had
been
swept
in
an
instant
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
surf
great
combers
green
and
ominous
looking
in
the
sunlight
broke
at
one
rapidly
advancing
point
toppled
and
fell
in
segments
filling
the
inner
shallows
with
a
smother
of
foam
beyond
it
lay
the
broad
fringe
of
white
deserted
beach
the
narrow
forest
of
shrub
and
palm
the
empty
lagoon
a
border
of
misty
islands
on
the
farther
side
i
had
seen
the
same
sort
of
a
picture
twenty
times
before
always
with
the
same
keen
sense
of
its
desolate
beauty
its
allurement
its
romantic
loveliness
tino
had
said
when
you
ve
seen
one
you
ve
seen
them
all
and
an
old
skipper
once
told
me
that
the
atolls
are
as
much
alike
as
the
reef
points
on
that
sail
it
is
true
they
are
as
monotonous
as
the
sea
itself
and
as
fresh
with
varying
interest
the
village
was
hidden
among
the
trees
but
i
saw
the
french
flag
flying
near
a
break
in
the
reef
which
marked
the
landing
place
for
small
boats
farther
back
a
little
knot
of
people
were
gathered
some
of
them
sitting
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
others
in
the
deep
shade
leaning
against
the
trees
in
attitudes
of
dreamy
meditation
three
girls
were
combing
their
hair
talking
and
laughing
in
an
animated
way
they
were
dressed
in
all
their
european
finery
gowns
of
flowered
muslin
pulled
up
around
their
bare
legs
to
prevent
soilure
a
matronly
woman
in
a
red
wrapper
had
thrown
the
upper
covering
aside
and
sat
naked
to
the
waist
nursing
a
baby
i
put
down
my
glasses
feeling
rather
ashamed
of
my
scrutiny
as
though
i
had
been
peeping
through
a
window
at
some
intimate
domestic
scene
the
island
leaped
into
the
distance
the
broad
circle
of
foam
and
jagged
reef
narrowed
to
a
thread
of
white
and
the
crept
landward
again
under
a
light
breeze
an
atom
of
a
ship
on
a
vast
and
empty
sea
eight
bells
struck
a
tinkling
sound
deadened
scarcely
audible
in
the
wide
air
i
heard
tino
s
voice
as
though
coming
from
an
immense
distance
hello
up
there
ready
i
said
all
right
i
m
coming
and
was
surprised
at
the
loudness
of
my
own
shout
but
i
waited
for
a
moment
to
indulge
myself
in
a
last
reflection
it
is
years
since
the
put
in
here
excepting
a
few
traders
and
missionaries
there
isn
t
probably
one
man
in
one
hundred
thousand
who
has
ever
heard
of
this
atoll
not
one
in
a
million
who
has
ever
seen
it
or
ever
will
see
it
what
a
piece
of
luck
for
me
then
i
saw
oro
at
the
galley
door
with
a
huge
platter
of
boiled
beef
and
sweet
potatoes
the
sight
of
it
reminded
me
that
i
was
very
hungry
as
i
climbed
down
to
the
deck
i
was
conscious
of
the
fact
that
a
healthy
appetite
and
a
good
digestion
were
a
piece
of
luck
too
and
that
as
long
as
one
could
hold
it
the
lure
of
islands
would
remain
and
one
s
love
of
living
burn
with
a
clear
flame
jack
the
monkey
seemed
to
divine
my
thought
to
agree
with
it
as
oro
the
food
bearer
passed
him
he
reached
down
from
his
perch
in
the
rigging
seized
the
largest
sweet
potato
on
the
platter
and
clambered
out
of
reach
assured
of
his
safety
he
fell
to
greedily
looking
out
wistfully
toward
the
land
the
pass
was
at
the
farther
end
of
the
lagoon
and
in
order
to
save
time
in
getting
the
work
ashore
under
way
the
supercargo
and
i
with
three
of
the
sailors
put
off
in
the
whaleboat
to
land
on
the
ocean
side
of
the
village
half
a
dozen
men
rushed
into
the
surf
seized
and
held
the
boat
as
the
backwash
poured
down
the
steep
incline
at
the
edge
of
the
reef
among
them
was
the
chief
a
man
of
huge
frame
six
feet
two
or
three
in
height
like
the
others
who
assisted
at
the
landing
he
was
clad
only
in
a
but
he
lost
none
of
his
dignity
through
his
nakedness
he
was
years
old
as
i
afterward
learned
and
as
he
stood
bidding
us
welcome
i
thought
of
the
strange
appearance
certain
of
the
chief
men
in
america
or
france
or
england
would
make
under
similar
circumstances
deprived
of
the
kindly
concealment
of
clothing
what
a
revelation
it
would
be
of
skinniness
or
pudginess
what
an
exhibition
of
scrawny
necks
fat
stomachs
flat
chests
flabby
arms
to
be
strictly
accurate
i
had
seen
some
fat
stomachs
among
elderly
paumotuans
but
they
were
exceptions
and
always
remarkable
for
that
reason
and
those
who
carried
them
had
sturdy
legs
they
did
not
give
one
the
uneasy
feeling
common
at
home
at
the
sight
of
the
great
paunches
of
sedentary
men
toppling
unsteadily
along
a
strip
of
crimson
carpet
from
curb
to
club
doorway
wherever
one
goes
in
polynesia
one
is
reminded
by
contrast
of
the
cost
physically
to
men
of
our
own
race
of
our
sheltered
way
of
living
there
on
every
hand
are
men
well
past
middle
life
with
compact
symmetrical
bodies
and
the
natural
grace
of
healthy
children
one
sees
them
carrying
immense
burdens
without
exertion
swimming
in
the
open
sea
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
while
spearing
fish
loafing
ashore
with
no
greater
apparent
effort
for
yet
longer
periods
sometimes
when
they
have
it
they
eat
enormous
quantities
of
food
at
one
sitting
and
at
others
under
necessity
as
sparingly
as
so
many
dyspeptics
it
would
be
impossible
to
formulate
from
their
example
any
rules
for
rational
living
in
more
civilized
communities
the
daily
quest
for
food
under
primitive
conditions
keeps
them
alert
and
sound
of
body
so
that
whether
they
work
or
loaf
feast
or
fast
they
seem
always
to
acquire
health
by
it
there
had
been
no
boats
at
rutiaro
in
five
months
and
the
crowd
on
the
beach
was
unfeignedly
glad
to
see
us
the
arrival
of
a
schooner
at
that
remote
island
was
an
event
of
great
importance
the
sight
of
new
faces
lighted
their
own
with
pleasure
which
warmed
the
heart
toward
them
at
once
we
had
brought
ashore
a
consignment
of
goods
for
moy
ling
the
chinese
storekeeper
and
when
the
handshaking
was
over
they
gathered
around
it
as
eagerly
as
a
group
of
american
children
at
a
christmas
tree
even
the
village
constable
seemed
unconscious
of
any
need
for
a
show
of
dignity
or
authority
the
only
badge
of
his
office
was
a
picture
of
president
poincaré
fastened
with
a
safety
pin
to
his
old
felt
hat
he
neglected
his
duties
as
a
keeper
of
order
and
was
one
of
the
most
excited
of
moy
ling
s
helpers
with
the
cargo
he
kept
patting
him
affectionately
on
the
back
saying
maitai
which
in
that
situation
may
be
freely
translated
as
you
know
me
moy
ling
and
the
old
chinaman
smiled
the
pleasant
noncommittal
smile
of
his
countrymen
the
world
over
tino
s
was
the
only
sour
face
on
the
beach
he
moved
through
the
crowd
giving
orders
grumbling
and
growling
half
to
himself
and
half
to
me
i
told
you
they
were
a
lazy
lot
he
said
they
ve
seen
us
making
in
for
three
hours
and
what
have
they
been
doing
loafing
on
the
beach
waiting
for
us
instead
of
getting
their
copra
together
moy
ling
is
the
only
one
in
the
village
who
is
ready
to
do
business
five
tons
all
sacked
for
weighing
he
s
worth
a
dozen
kanakas
well
i
ll
set
em
to
work
in
quick
time
now
you
watch
me
i
m
going
to
be
loaded
and
out
of
here
by
six
o
clock
but
chance
using
me
as
an
innocent
accomplice
ordered
it
otherwise
it
was
sir
thomas
browne
who
said
those
who
hold
that
all
things
are
governed
by
fortune
had
not
erred
had
they
not
persisted
there
he
may
be
right
although
i
don
t
remember
now
where
his
own
nonpersistence
lay
but
there
are
some
things
some
events
which
chance
or
one
wishes
to
call
from
the
outset
with
an
amazing
show
of
omnipotence
tracing
them
back
one
becomes
almost
convinced
of
a
fixed
intent
a
unwavering
determination
in
its
apparently
haphazard
functioning
it
is
clear
to
me
now
that
because
i
had
been
fond
of
playing
marbles
as
a
boy
i
was
to
be
marooned
fifteen
years
later
on
a
fragment
of
land
six
thousand
miles
from
the
lumber
yard
of
brown
son
tino
had
no
more
to
do
with
that
result
than
i
did
he
merely
lost
his
temper
because
chance
disorganized
his
plans
for
an
early
departure
tried
to
quench
his
anger
in
rum
and
became
more
furious
still
because
he
was
drunk
then
off
he
went
in
the
leaving
me
stranded
ashore
i
can
still
hear
his
parting
salutation
which
he
roared
at
me
though
a
megaphone
across
the
starlit
lagoon
you
can
but
this
is
anticipating
the
story
moves
in
a
more
leisurely
fashion
as
i
have
said
my
box
of
marbles
came
to
light
again
only
a
few
hours
before
we
reached
rutiaro
i
took
them
ashore
with
me
thinking
they
might
amuse
the
children
they
had
a
good
knowledge
of
the
technic
of
shooting
acquired
in
a
game
common
among
the
atolls
which
is
played
with
bits
of
polished
coral
but
theirs
had
always
seemed
to
me
a
tame
pastime
lacking
the
interest
of
stakes
to
be
won
or
lost
i
instructed
them
in
the
simple
rules
of
and
tom
which
they
quickly
mastered
then
i
divided
the
marbles
equally
among
them
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
the
winner
held
his
gains
although
marbles
like
trade
goods
might
be
bartered
for
i
emphasized
that
feature
of
the
game
because
of
a
recollection
remaining
from
my
own
days
of
the
contempt
in
which
boys
were
held
who
refused
to
hazard
their
marbles
in
a
test
of
skill
they
refused
to
play
for
keeps
and
the
rest
of
us
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
the
youngsters
of
rutiaro
were
not
of
that
stamp
they
took
their
losses
in
good
part
when
i
saw
that
i
left
them
to
themselves
and
went
for
a
walk
through
the
village
i
least
i
thought
i
our
stay
was
to
be
brief
and
i
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
it
i
followed
the
street
bordering
the
lagoon
past
the
freshly
thatched
houses
with
their
entryways
wide
to
the
sun
and
wind
and
came
at
length
to
a
small
burying
ground
which
lay
in
an
area
of
green
shadow
far
from
the
village
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
graves
within
the
inclosure
some
of
them
neatly
mounded
over
with
broken
coral
and
white
shell
others
incased
in
a
kind
of
sarcophagus
of
native
cement
to
keep
more
restless
spirits
from
wandering
abroad
most
of
them
were
unmarked
two
or
three
had
wooden
headboards
one
of
which
was
covered
with
a
long
inscription
in
chinese
beneath
this
the
word
repose
was
printed
in
english
as
though
it
had
some
peculiar
talismanic
significance
for
the
chinaman
who
had
placed
it
there
it
was
the
grave
of
a
predecessor
of
moy
ling
s
i
fell
to
thinking
of
him
as
i
sat
there
and
of
all
the
chinamen
i
had
met
in
the
earlier
days
lonely
isolated
figures
most
of
them
without
family
or
friends
or
the
saving
companionship
of
books
what
was
it
that
kept
them
going
what
goal
were
they
striving
toward
through
lives
which
held
so
little
of
the
comfort
or
happiness
essential
to
the
rest
of
humankind
repose
a
better
end
than
that
surely
the
air
rang
with
the
sound
of
the
word
the
garish
sunlight
fell
pitilessly
on
the
print
of
it
to
most
men
i
believe
with
the
best
of
life
still
before
them
there
is
something
terrible
infamous
in
the
thought
of
the
unrelieved
blackness
of
an
endless
dreamless
sleep
i
turned
from
the
contemplation
of
it
let
my
thoughts
wander
in
a
mist
of
dreams
of
fancies
which
glimmered
through
consciousness
like
streaks
of
sunlight
in
a
dusty
attic
these
vanished
at
length
and
for
a
time
i
was
as
dead
to
thought
or
feeling
as
moy
ling
s
predecessor
sleeping
beside
me
i
was
awakened
by
some
one
shaking
me
by
the
shoulder
a
voice
said
i
te
pai
come
down
to
the
boat
and
a
dark
figure
ran
on
before
turning
from
time
to
time
to
urge
me
to
greater
speed
it
was
almost
night
although
there
was
still
light
enough
to
see
by
i
remembered
that
tino
had
told
me
to
be
at
the
copra
sheds
at
five
the
tide
would
serve
for
getting
through
the
pass
until
eight
but
i
hurried
nevertheless
feeling
that
something
unusual
had
happened
rounding
a
point
of
land
which
cut
off
the
view
from
the
village
and
the
inner
lagoon
i
saw
the
schooner
about
three
hundred
yards
off
shore
slim
and
black
against
a
streak
of
orange
cloud
to
the
northward
she
was
moving
slowly
out
under
power
the
whaleboat
was
being
hoisted
over
the
side
and
at
the
wheel
i
saw
the
familiar
silhouette
of
the
supercargo
i
shouted
hi
tino
wait
a
minute
you
re
not
going
to
leave
me
behind
are
you
a
moment
of
silence
followed
then
came
the
answer
with
the
odd
deliberation
of
utterance
which
i
knew
meant
tahiti
rum
you
can
stay
there
and
play
marbles
till
hell
freezes
over
i
m
through
with
you
what
had
happened
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
afterward
was
this
my
box
of
marbles
which
i
had
brought
ashore
for
the
amusement
of
the
children
interested
the
as
well
particularly
the
hazard
of
stakes
in
the
games
i
had
shown
them
paumotuans
have
a
good
deal
of
scotch
acquisitiveness
in
their
they
coveted
those
were
really
worth
it
was
not
long
until
play
became
general
a
family
affair
the
experts
in
one
being
pitted
against
those
in
another
regardless
of
age
or
sex
tino
s
threats
and
entreaties
had
been
to
no
purpose
all
work
came
to
an
end
and
the
only
copra
which
got
aboard
the
was
moy
ling
s
five
tons
carried
out
by
the
sailors
themselves
evidently
puarei
the
chief
had
been
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
players
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
bulldozed
or
browbeaten
he
had
great
dignity
and
force
of
character
for
all
his
boyish
delight
in
simple
amusements
what
right
had
tino
to
say
that
he
should
not
play
marbles
on
his
own
island
he
gave
me
to
understand
by
means
of
gestures
intonation
and
a
mixture
of
french
and
paumotuan
that
this
was
what
the
supercargo
had
done
at
last
apparently
tino
had
sent
oro
on
an
unsuccessful
search
for
me
he
thought
i
suppose
that
having
been
the
cause
of
the
mania
i
might
be
able
and
willing
to
check
it
balked
there
he
went
on
board
in
a
fit
of
violent
temper
and
had
not
been
seen
again
although
his
voice
was
heard
for
an
hour
thereafter
of
a
sudden
anchor
was
weighed
and
i
was
left
as
he
assured
me
to
play
marbles
with
the
inhabitants
of
rutiaro
for
an
impossibly
long
time
most
of
these
details
i
gathered
afterward
at
the
moment
i
guessed
just
enough
of
the
truth
not
to
be
wholly
mystified
the
watery
sputtering
of
the
engine
grew
faint
then
with
a
ghostly
gleam
of
her
mainsail
in
the
starlight
she
was
gong
i
was
thinking
by
jove
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
this
experience
for
all
the
copra
in
the
cloud
of
islands
i
was
glad
that
there
were
still
adventures
of
that
sort
to
be
had
in
a
humdrum
world
it
was
so
absurd
so
fantastically
unreal
as
to
fit
nothing
but
reality
and
the
event
of
it
was
exactly
what
i
had
wanted
all
the
time
without
knowing
it
there
was
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
stop
at
rutiaro
to
be
sure
i
was
shortly
to
have
met
my
friend
nordhoff
at
papeete
but
our
rendezvous
was
planned
to
be
broken
we
were
wandering
in
the
south
pacific
as
opportunity
and
inclination
should
direct
which
i
take
it
is
the
only
way
to
wander
for
a
few
moments
i
was
so
deeply
occupied
with
my
own
thoughts
that
i
was
not
conscious
of
what
was
taking
place
around
me
all
the
village
was
gathered
there
watching
the
departing
schooner
as
she
vanished
a
loud
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
like
a
sough
of
wind
through
polynesian
indicative
of
astonishment
indignation
pity
paumotuan
sympathies
are
large
and
i
had
been
the
victim
of
treachery
they
thought
and
was
silently
grieving
at
the
prospect
of
a
long
exile
they
gathered
around
patting
me
on
the
back
in
their
odd
way
expressing
their
condolences
as
best
they
could
but
i
soon
relieved
their
minds
on
that
score
then
huirai
the
constable
with
the
insignia
pushed
his
way
through
with
the
first
show
of
authority
i
had
seen
him
make
i
been
frisco
he
said
with
an
odd
accent
on
the
last
syllable
he
had
made
the
journey
once
as
a
stoker
on
one
of
the
mail
boats
then
he
added
you
go
to
hell
me
his
eyes
shining
with
pride
that
he
could
be
of
service
as
a
reminder
of
home
to
an
exiled
american
he
was
about
to
take
charge
of
me
in
view
of
his
knowledge
of
english
but
the
chief
waved
him
away
with
a
gesture
of
authority
i
was
to
be
his
guest
he
said
at
any
rate
for
the
present
he
began
his
duties
as
host
by
entertaining
me
at
dinner
at
moy
ling
s
store
i
was
a
little
surprised
that
we
did
not
go
to
his
house
for
the
meal
until
i
remembered
that
the
chinaman
had
received
the
only
consignment
of
exotic
food
left
by
the
puarei
ordered
the
feast
with
the
discrimination
of
a
gourmet
and
the
generosity
of
a
sailor
on
shore
leave
for
the
first
time
in
months
we
had
smoked
herring
for
followed
by
soup
curried
chicken
and
rice
edible
birds
nests
flavored
with
crab
meat
from
china
and
white
bread
for
dessert
we
had
small
chinese
pears
preserved
in
vinegar
which
we
ate
out
of
the
woman
brand
pears
the
label
said
there
was
a
colored
picture
on
it
of
a
white
woman
in
puffed
sleeves
and
a
long
skirt
seated
in
a
garden
while
a
chinaman
served
her
deferentially
with
pears
out
of
the
same
kind
of
a
container
underneath
was
printed
in
english
these
pears
will
be
found
highly
stimulating
we
respectfully
submit
them
to
our
customers
that
was
the
first
evidence
i
had
seen
of
china
s
bid
for
export
trade
in
tinned
fruit
stimulating
may
not
have
been
just
the
word
but
i
liked
the
touch
of
chinese
courtesy
which
followed
it
it
didn
t
seem
out
of
place
even
coming
from
a
canning
factory
puarei
gave
all
his
attention
to
his
food
and
consumed
an
enormous
quantity
my
own
appetite
was
a
healthy
one
but
i
had
not
his
capacity
of
stomach
furthermore
he
ate
with
his
fingers
while
i
was
handicapped
from
the
first
with
a
fork
and
a
small
tin
spoon
i
believe
they
were
the
only
implements
of
the
sort
on
the
island
for
the
village
had
been
searched
for
them
before
they
were
found
it
was
another
evidence
to
me
of
the
unfrequented
nature
of
rutiaro
and
of
its
slender
contact
even
with
the
world
of
papeete
traders
at
most
of
the
islands
we
had
visited
knives
and
forks
were
common
although
rarely
used
except
in
the
presence
of
strangers
the
onlookers
at
the
half
the
village
i
should
with
interest
my
efforts
to
balance
mouthfuls
of
rice
on
a
fork
i
could
see
that
they
regarded
it
as
a
ridiculous
proceeding
they
must
have
thought
americans
a
strange
folk
checking
appetite
and
worrying
digestion
with
such
doubtful
aids
finally
i
decided
to
follow
the
chief
s
example
and
set
to
with
my
fingers
they
laughed
at
that
and
puarei
looked
up
from
his
third
plate
of
rice
and
chicken
to
nod
approval
it
was
a
strange
meal
reminding
me
of
stories
i
had
read
as
a
boy
of
louis
xv
dining
in
public
at
versailles
with
a
roomful
of
visitors
from
foreign
courts
looking
on
whispering
behind
fans
and
lace
cuffs
exchanging
awestruck
glances
at
the
splendor
of
the
service
the
richness
of
the
food
and
the
sight
of
majesty
fulfilling
a
need
common
to
all
humankind
there
was
no
whispering
among
the
crowd
at
the
chinaman
s
shop
no
awestruck
glances
other
than
moy
ling
s
at
the
majesty
of
puarei
s
appetite
i
felt
sorry
for
him
as
he
trotted
back
and
forth
from
his
outdoor
kitchen
bringing
in
more
food
thinking
of
his
depleted
stock
smiling
with
an
expression
of
wan
and
worried
amiability
louis

would
have
given
something
i
ll
venture
for
that
old
paumotuan
chief
s
zest
for
food
for
the
kingly
weight
of
bone
and
muscle
which
demanded
such
a
store
of
nourishment
he
pushed
back
his
chair
at
length
with
a
sign
of
satisfaction
and
a
girl
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
removed
the
empty
dishes
paumotuan
hospitality
is
an
easy
gracious
thing
imposing
obligations
on
neither
host
nor
guest
dinner
over
i
told
puarei
that
i
wanted
to
take
a
walk
and
he
believed
me
i
was
free
at
once
and
i
knew
that
he
would
not
be
worrying
meanwhile
about
my
entertainment
i
would
not
be
searched
for
presently
and
pounced
upon
with
the
dreaded
see
here
i
m
afraid
you
are
not
having
a
good
time
of
the
uneasy
host
i
was
introduced
to
no
one
dragged
nowhere
to
see
anything
free
from
the
necessity
of
being
amused
i
might
do
as
i
and
glorious
i
went
outside
grateful
for
it
and
for
the
cloak
of
darkness
which
enabled
me
to
move
about
unobserved
it
lifted
here
and
there
in
the
glow
of
supper
fires
or
a
streak
of
yellow
lamplight
from
an
open
doorway
i
saw
family
groups
gathered
around
their
meals
of
fish
and
coconuts
heard
the
loud
intake
of
breath
as
they
sucked
the
sauce
from
their
fingers
dogs
were
splashing
about
in
the
shallows
of
the
lagoon
seeking
their
own
supper
of
fish
they
are
a
strange
breed
the
dogs
of
the
atolls
like
no
other
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
mixture
of
all
breeds
one
would
think
a
weird
blending
of
good
blood
and
bad
the
peculiar
environment
and
the
strange
diet
have
altered
them
so
that
they
hardly
seem
dogs
at
all
but
rather
semiamphibious
animals
more
at
home
in
the
sea
than
on
land
they
are
with
their
masters
and
with
strangers
but
fierce
fighters
among
themselves
i
sat
down
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
concealed
from
the
light
of
one
of
the
smoldering
supper
fires
and
watched
a
group
of
rutiaroan
dogs
in
their
search
for
food
they
had
developed
a
sort
of
team
work
in
the
business
leaped
toward
the
shore
all
together
with
a
curving
of
their
bodies
and
were
as
quick
as
a
flock
of
terns
to
see
and
to
seize
their
prey
returning
from
my
walk
i
found
the
village
street
deserted
and
all
of
the
people
assembled
back
of
moy
ling
s
shop
he
was
mixing
bread
at
a
table
while
one
of
the
sons
of
his
strange
family
piled
fresh
fuel
on
the
fire
under
a
long
brick
oven
it
was
a
great
event
the
bread
making
after
the
long
months
of
dearth
and
of
interest
to
everyone
mats
were
spread
within
the
circle
of
the
firelight
puarei
was
there
with
his
mountain
of
a
at
his
side
she
was
dressed
in
a
wrapper
and
her
long
black
hair
fell
in
a
pool
of
shadow
on
the
mat
behind
her
she
was
a
fit
wife
for
a
chief
in
size
in
energy
in
the
fire
and
spirit
living
in
the
huge
bulk
of
flesh
her
laughter
came
in
a
clear
stream
which
it
was
a
delight
to
hear
there
was
no
undertone
of
foreboding
or
bitter
remembrance
and
the
flow
of
it
as
as
a
child
s
heightened
the
merrymaking
mood
of
the
others
there
was
a
babble
of
talk
bursts
of
song
impromptu
dancing
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
accordion
and
the
clapping
of
hands
as
i
looked
on
i
was
minded
of
an
account
i
had
read
of
the
paumotuans
in
which
they
were
described
as
a
dour
people
silent
brooding
and
religious
religious
some
of
them
assuredly
are
despite
a
good
deal
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
and
they
are
often
silent
in
the
dreamy
way
of
remote
island
people
whose
moods
are
drawn
from
the
sea
whose
minds
lie
fallow
to
the
peace
and
the
beauty
of
it
but
dour
and
brooding
is
very
far
from
the
truth
i
took
a
place
among
them
as
quietly
as
possible
for
i
knew
by
repeated
experience
how
curious
they
are
about
strangers
and
first
meetings
were
usually
embarrassing
without
long
training
as
a
freak
with
a
circus
it
would
try
any
man
s
courage
to
sit
for
an
hour
among
a
group
of
paumotuans
while
he
was
being
discussed
item
by
item
there
is
nothing
consciously
brutal
or
callous
in
the
manner
of
it
but
rather
an
unreflecting
frankness
like
that
of
children
in
the
presence
of
something
strange
to
their
experience
i
knew
little
of
the
language
although
i
caught
a
word
here
and
there
which
indicated
the
trend
of
the
comment
it
was
not
general
fortunately
but
confined
to
those
on
either
side
of
me
two
old
grandmothers
started
a
speculation
as
to
whether
or
not
i
had
any
children
and
from
this
a
discussion
rose
as
to
which
of
the
girls
of
rutiaro
would
be
best
suited
as
a
wife
for
me
i
was
growing
desperate
when
chance
the
godfather
of
all
wanderers
intervened
again
in
my
favor
moy
ling
s
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
it
occurred
to
several
of
the
youngsters
to
resume
their
marble
playing
i
saw
puarei
s
face
light
with
pleasure
and
he
was
on
his
feet
at
once
with
his
stake
in
the
ring
others
followed
and
soon
all
those
who
had
marbles
were
in
the
sport
i
understood
clearly
then
how
helpless
tino
had
been
i
could
easily
picture
him
rushing
from
group
to
group
furious
at
the
thought
of
his
interests
being
neglected
through
such
childish
folly
those
marbles
were
more
desirable
than
his
flour
and
canned
goods
which
he
stood
ready
to
exchange
for
copra
the
explanation
of
this
astounding
fact
may
have
been
that
no
one
thought
he
would
go
off
as
he
did
and
would
do
just
as
well
for
getting
down
to
business
since
he
had
gone
there
was
an
end
of
that
it
was
futile
to
worry
about
the
lost
food
certainly
it
was
forgotten
during
the
great
tournament
which
took
place
that
evening
moy
ling
worked
at
his
bread
making
unnoticed
his
fire
died
down
to
a
heap
of
coals
but
another
was
built
and
the
play
went
on
puarei
was
a
splendid
shot
in
marble
playing
as
in
other
respects
the
best
man
of
the
village
but
there
was
a
slip
of
a
girl
who
was
even
better
during
the
evening
she
accumulated
nearly
half
of
the
entire
marble
supply
and
at
length
these
two
met
for
a
test
of
skill
it
was
a
game
i
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
the
interest
of
both
players
and
spectators
not
even
at
brown
s
lumber
yard
when
the
stakes
were
a
boy
s
most
precious
possessions
cornelian
stone
taws
no
one
thought
of
sleep
except
a
few
of
the
old
men
and
women
who
dozed
off
at
intervals
with
their
heads
between
their
knees
the
lateness
of
the
bizarre
setting
for
a
game
so
linked
with
memories
of
boyhood
combined
to
give
me
an
impression
of
unreality
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
island
and
all
the
people
on
it
might
vanish
at
any
moment
and
the
roar
of
the
surf
resolve
itself
into
the
rumble
of
street
traffic
in
some
gray
city
and
though
it
were
the
very
city
where
marbles
are
made
where
in
the
length
or
breadth
of
it
could
there
be
found
anyone
who
knew
the
use
of
them
with
either
the
time
or
the
inclination
to
play
i
might
search
it
street
by
street
to
the
suburbs
i
might
go
on
to
the
green
country
perhaps
visit
all
the
rendezvous
from
one
coast
to
the
other
with
no
better
success
and
though
i
passed
through
a
thousand
villages
of
the
size
of
rutiaro
could
an
evening
s
amusement
be
provided
in
any
one
of
them
for
men
women
and
children
at
an
outlay
of
four
dollars
american
the
possibility
would
not
be
worth
considering
people
at
home
live
too
fast
in
these
days
and
they
want
too
much
i
could
imagine
tino
in
a
sober
mood
giving
a
grudging
assent
to
this
but
man
he
would
have
added
i
wish
they
had
more
of
their
enthusiasm
at
rutiaro
i
would
put
in
here
three
times
a
year
and
fill
the
with
copra
to
within
an
inch
of
the
main
boom
every
trip
moy
ling
had
enough
of
it
for
the
whole
island
it
seemed
to
me
his
ovens
were
opened
as
the
tournament
came
to
an
end
and
for
half
an
hour
he
was
kept
busy
passing
out
crisp
brown
loaves
and
jotting
down
the
list
of
creditors
in
his
account
book
it
must
have
been
nearly
midnight
the
crowd
began
to
disperse
puarei
joined
me
smiling
ruefully
holding
out
empty
hands
he
had
lost
all
of
his
marbles
to
a
mite
of
a
girl
whom
he
could
have
put
in
his
vest
pocket
had
he
owned
one
his
wife
teased
him
about
it
on
the
way
home
laughed
heartily
at
his
explanations
and
excuses
they
discussed
the
events
of
the
day
long
after
the
other
members
of
the
household
had
retired
to
their
mats
on
the
veranda
at
last
i
heard
their
quiet
breathing
and
a
strip
of
light
from
the
last
quarter
moon
revealed
them
asleep
two
massive
heads
on
the
same
pillow
i
lay
awake
for
a
much
longer
time
thinking
of
one
thing
and
my
friend
crichton
at
tanao
the
loneliest
atoll
in
the
world
i
should
say
of
the
far
out
to
sea
homeward
bound
with
one
hundred
and
forty
tons
of
copra
in
her
hold
of
tino
with
his
fits
of
temper
and
his
passion
for
trade
which
blinded
him
to
so
much
of
the
beauty
and
the
joy
of
life
but
after
all
i
thought
it
is
men
like
tino
who
keep
wheels
turning
and
boats
traveling
the
seas
if
he
were
to
die
his
loss
would
be
felt
there
would
be
an
eddy
in
the
current
of
life
around
him
but
men
like
crichton
or
should
go
down
in
our
time
and
the
broad
stream
would
flow
over
our
heads
without
a
ripple
to
show
where
we
had
been
without
a
bubble
rising
to
the
surface
to
carry
with
it
for
a
moment
the
memory
of
our
lives
it
was
not
a
comforting
thought
and
i
tried
to
evade
it
but
i
realized
that
my
new
england
conscience
was
playing
a
part
in
these
reflections
and
was
not
to
be
soothed
in
any
such
childish
manner
how
much
copra
have
you
ever
produced
or
carried
to
market
it
appeared
to
say
i
admitted
that
the
amount
was
negligible
how
do
you
mean
to
justify
your
presence
here
was
the
next
question
and
before
i
could
think
of
a
satisfactory
answer
what
good
will
come
of
this
experience
either
to
yourself
or
to
anyone
else
that
was
a
puzzler
until
i
happened
to
think
of
findlay
s
pacific
i
remembered
that
his
information
about
rutiaro
was
very
scant
the
general
remarks
confined
as
i
have
already
said
to
a
single
sentence
a
lonely
atoll
numbering
a
population
of
between
and
one
hundred
inhabitants
as
a
sop
to
my
conscience
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
write
to
the
publishers
of
that
learned
work
suggesting
that
in
the
light
of
recent
investigations
they
add
to
that
description
fond
of
playing
marbles
illustration
chapter
vi
tailpiece
debtor
of
moy
puarei
s
house
stood
halfway
down
the
village
street
at
rutiaro
facing
a
broad
indentation
from
the
lagoon
the
catholic
church
adjoined
it
on
one
side
the
protestant
church
on
the
other
neither
of
them
was
an
imposing
structure
but
they
towered
above
the
small
frame
dwelling
of
the
chief
with
an
air
of
protection
of
jealous
watchfulness
on
sunny
days
they
shaded
his
roof
in
turn
and
when
it
rained
poured
over
it
streams
of
water
through
lead
pipes
projecting
from
their
own
ampler
purely
utilitarian
function
since
the
drainage
from
the
three
buildings
furnished
the
supply
of
the
settlement
if
the
showers
were
light
the
overflow
from
the
largess
of
the
rival
churches
plashing
on
the
sheets
of
corrugated
iron
filled
the
house
with
a
monotonous
murmur
like
the
drowsy
argument
of
two
missionaries
but
during
a
heavy
downpour
the
senses
were
stunned
by
the
incessant
thunder
as
though
one
were
inclosed
in
an
immense
drum
beaten
with
nonsectarian
vigor
by
all
the
salvation
armies
in
the
world
it
was
during
such
a
deluge
one
day
in
early
spring
that
i
lay
on
the
guest
bed
in
puarei
s
house
watching
poura
his
wife
who
had
washed
my
linen
with
her
own
hands
and
was
then
ironing
it
it
was
not
strictly
speaking
linen
the
articles
were
sleeveless
gauze
singlet
a
cotton
handkerchief
and
a
faded
khaki
shirt
a
pair
of
khaki
trousers
a
pair
of
canvas
tennis
shoes
and
a
pandanus
hat
completed
my
wardrobe
since
i
needed
the
whole
of
it
when
going
abroad
about
the
island
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
bed
on
washing
day
and
to
wait
there
until
the
laundering
was
finished
and
such
repairs
made
as
constant
wear
had
caused
and
further
wear
demanded
how
to
replenish
it
and
to
meet
other
simple
urgent
needs
gave
me
cause
for
some
concern
and
i
was
going
over
the
problem
as
i
lay
on
puarei
s
guest
bed
it
was
toward
the
end
of
my
second
week
at
rutiaro
and
already
i
was
beginning
to
look
decidedly
shabby
my
shoes
were
rotted
out
with
sea
water
and
both
shirt
and
trousers
which
were
far
from
new
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
gave
evidence
of
early
dissolution
poura
had
washed
sewed
on
buttons
drawn
seams
together
but
the
garments
were
chronically
ailing
as
hopeless
of
effective
repair
as
an
old
man
far
gone
in
senile
decay
poura
was
becoming
discouraged
about
them
and
i
knew
that
she
must
be
wondering
why
i
didn
t
buy
some
fresh
ones
i
had
a
very
good
reason
for
not
doing
had
no
money
i
had
been
left
at
rutiaro
without
so
much
as
a
piece
and
the
banque
de
l
was
six
hundred
miles
away
it
would
not
occur
to
either
puarei
or
his
wife
that
i
was
in
need
of
funds
theirs
was
one
of
the
more
primitive
atolls
of
the
low
archipelago
where
all
white
men
are
regarded
as
mysteriously
affluent
if
instead
of
being
marooned
at
rutiaro
through
tino
s
fit
of
temper
i
had
been
discovered
a
mile
outside
the
reef
making
toward
the
land
clad
only
in
a
pair
of
swimming
trunks
upon
reaching
it
my
rescuers
would
have
expected
me
as
a
matter
of
course
to
take
a
bulky
parcel
of
notes
from
beneath
that
garment
i
had
in
fact
made
a
secret
inventory
of
my
wealth
after
the
sudden
departure
of
the
hoping
there
might
be
a
forgotten
bank
note
in
one
of
my
trousers
pockets
what
i
found
was
a
cotton
handkerchief
a
picture
post
card
of
the
woolworth
building
and
a
small
musical
instrument
called
an
or
more
commonly
a
whistle
the
handkerchief
i
needed
the
post
card
seemed
of
no
practical
use
as
a
means
of
barter
and
while
i
might
have
given
up
the
it
had
but
a
slight
monetary
value
and
moy
ling
the
chinese
storekeeper
of
the
village
was
not
interested
in
it
i
didn
t
offer
it
to
him
outright
instead
i
played
on
it
in
front
of
his
shop
the
march
of
the
black
watch
which
i
could
render
with
some
skill
thereafter
every
youngster
on
the
island
coveted
the
instrument
but
moy
ling
made
no
offers
and
the
prospect
of
a
wardrobe
was
as
far
away
as
ever
his
supply
of
european
clothing
was
limited
but
ample
to
supply
my
wants
he
found
for
me
three
undershirts
size
two
gingham
outer
shirts
of
less
ample
proportions
a
pair
of
dungaree
overalls
and
a
pair
of
shoes
i
asked
him
to
put
these
articles
aside
and
went
off
to
reflect
upon
ways
and
means
of
opening
a
credit
account
with
the
canny
chinaman
there
was
one
possible
method
open
to
me
i
might
adopt
the
as
a
costume
i
could
buy
three
of
them
for
the
price
of
one
undershirt
and
i
believed
that
moy
ling
would
trust
me
to
that
extent
nearly
all
of
the
natives
wore
they
had
put
aside
their
trousers
and
shirts
and
gingham
dresses
now
that
i
was
no
longer
a
stranger
to
them
and
were
much
more
comfortable
in
their
simple
garments
those
of
the
men
reaching
from
the
waist
those
of
the
women
twisted
tightly
under
the
arms
simple
and
convenient
though
it
was
i
felt
that
it
would
be
absurd
for
me
to
assume
that
style
of
dress
since
i
was
not
accustomed
to
it
furthermore
i
remembered
the
ridiculous
appearance
of
americans
and
europeans
i
had
seen
at
people
from
all
sorts
of
queer
places
who
come
and
go
through
the
capital
of
french
oceania
they
rushed
into
the
moment
of
their
arrival
at
papeete
and
before
a
week
had
passed
were
more
primitive
in
a
sophisticated
way
than
the
tahitians
themselves
i
had
no
desire
to
join
the
ranks
of
the
amateur
cannibals
even
though
there
was
some
excuse
for
it
at
rutiaro
and
i
knew
that
the
paumotuans
would
have
more
respect
for
me
if
i
dressed
after
the
manner
of
my
own
race
but
how
obtain
clothing
without
divulging
to
anyone
that
i
had
no
money
the
question
dinned
through
my
brain
with
annoying
persistence
like
the
thunder
of
falling
water
on
puarei
s
iron
roof
would
it
after
all
be
best
to
confide
in
the
chief
i
could
tell
him
of
my
bank
account
at
papeete
and
he
knew
of
course
that
the
had
left
me
without
a
word
of
warning
taking
my
sea
chest
with
her
i
was
tempted
to
make
a
confession
of
my
predicament
but
pride
or
a
kind
of
childish
vanity
prevented
me
no
by
jove
i
said
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
do
puarei
his
the
rest
of
me
to
live
up
to
their
traditional
conceptions
of
white
men
i
am
supposed
to
be
mysteriously
affluent
and
i
owe
it
to
them
to
preserve
that
myth
in
all
its
romantic
glamour
i
had
no
feeling
of
guilt
in
making
this
decision
rather
a
sense
of
virtue
like
that
of
an
indulgent
father
upon
assuring
his
children
that
there
is
a
santa
claus
i
decided
to
be
not
only
mysteriously
but
incredibly
affluent
therefore
when
the
rain
had
passed
i
put
on
my
mended
garments
and
went
to
moy
ling
s
shop
i
found
him
splitting
coconuts
in
front
of
his
copra
shed
and
beckoned
to
him
in
a
careless
way
he
came
forward
smiling
pleasantly
as
usual
but
there
was
a
shrewd
glitter
in
his
eyes
which
said
quite
as
plainly
as
words
honorable
sir
i
bow
before
you
but
i
expect
an
adequate
monetary
return
for
the
service
i
was
not
intimidated
however
and
when
he
brought
forth
the
articles
i
had
selected
earlier
i
waved
them
of
them
excepting
the
shoes
the
only
male
footgear
of
any
kind
on
the
island
i
explained
that
i
had
not
before
seen
the
bolt
of
white
most
expensive
cloth
in
his
that
i
wanted
enough
of
it
to
make
four
suits
i
saw
at
once
that
i
had
risen
in
his
estimation
about
per
cent
and
thus
encouraged
i
went
on
buying
cloth
for
underwear
and
shirts
some
pencils
and
his
entire
supply
of
notebooks
for
my
voluminous
observations
on
the
life
and
character
of
the
paumotuans
a
flash
lamp
a
dozen
silk
handkerchiefs
of
chinese
manufacture
a
dozen
pairs
of
earrings
and
four
lockets
and
chains
ten
kilos
of
flour
and
two
of
coffee
three
bottles
of
perfume
in
fancy
boxes
four
large
bolts
of
to
reach
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
side
and
back
combs
for
women
superbly
ornamented
with
bits
of
colored
glass
a
bolt
of
mosquito
netting
a
monkey
wrench
two
beacon
lanterns
a
pandanus
mat
and
one
bow
tie
already
made
up
the
kind
sold
at
home
in
gents
furnishings
shops
at
the
beginning
i
had
no
thought
of
going
in
so
recklessly
but
as
i
went
from
article
to
article
the
conviction
grew
upon
me
that
the
deeper
i
plunged
the
greater
the
impression
i
should
make
upon
moy
ling
and
it
was
essential
that
i
should
convince
him
that
my
mythical
wealth
was
real
he
became
more
and
more
deferential
as
my
heap
of
purchases
increased
in
size
i
made
no
inquiry
as
to
the
price
of
anything
believing
that
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
mysteriously
affluent
tradition
at
my
back
i
heard
a
hum
of
excited
conversation
the
shop
was
filled
with
people
i
felt
the
crush
behind
me
but
took
no
notice
of
it
and
went
on
with
my
passionless
orgy
of
spending
two
bolts
of
women
s
dress
goods
four
pocketknives
a
can
of
green
paint
and
another
of
details
are
tiresome
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
bought
lavishly
and
selected
odds
and
ends
of
things
because
moy
s
shop
contained
nothing
else
he
had
a
large
supply
of
food
but
in
other
respects
his
stock
was
low
and
when
i
had
finished
some
of
his
shelves
were
almost
bare
on
one
there
remained
only
a
box
of
chewing
gum
an
inscription
printed
on
the
side
of
it
read
chew
on
macduff
you
can
t
chew
out
the
original
flavor
of
somebody
s
pepsin
to
that
effect
that
product
of
american
epicureanism
is
to
be
found
strangely
enough
at
nearly
every
chinaman
s
store
in
the
low
archipelago
i
bought
twenty
packages
of
it
since
there
were
no
other
confections
to
be
had
and
distributed
them
among
the
children
the
youthful
macduffs
chewed
on
for
some
thirty
seconds
and
then
swallowed
believing
in
their
unenlightened
way
that
gum
is
a
sort
of
food
i
had
read
of
monkeys
dying
in
zoos
because
of
the
same
practice
but
in
so
far
as
i
know
there
were
no
ill
effects
from
it
at
rutiaro
either
then
or
later
i
succeeded
very
well
in
impressing
puarei
he
was
astonished
at
the
number
of
my
purchases
and
poura
said
shooed
out
the
porters
who
carried
them
to
the
house
and
sat
down
in
the
doorway
her
enormous
body
completely
blocking
the
entrance
on
the
veranda
the
conversation
crackled
and
sparkled
with
conjecture
i
could
hear
above
the
others
the
voice
of
paki
wife
of
the
constable
enumerating
the
things
i
had
bought
it
sounded
odd
in
recitative
of
strange
words
most
of
them
adapted
from
the
english
since
all
of
the
articles
were
unknown
to
the
natives
before
the
coming
of
the
flour
ribbon
pencil
or
pen
coffee
etc
i
myself
was
wondering
what
use
i
could
make
of
some
of
my
wealth
the
flour
i
would
give
to
puarei
and
his
cutter
was
badly
in
need
of
paint
poura
would
be
glad
to
have
the
dress
goods
for
herself
and
her
girls
for
the
rutiaroans
put
aside
their
on
sunday
and
dressed
in
european
costume
i
could
also
give
her
the
mosquito
netting
as
a
drapery
for
the
guest
bed
i
had
in
fact
bought
it
with
that
end
in
mind
for
on
windless
nights
particularly
after
a
rain
the
mosquitoes
were
a
fearful
nuisance
puarei
s
household
was
used
to
them
but
i
tossed
and
tumbled
and
at
last
would
have
to
paddle
out
on
the
lagoon
and
stay
there
till
morning
the
coffee
likewise
was
for
my
own
use
puarei
believing
that
the
drinking
of
either
tea
or
coffee
was
forbidden
by
his
variety
of
the
christian
religion
tobacco
too
was
a
product
of
evil
and
the
use
of
it
made
broad
the
way
to
hell
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
any
missionary
would
wander
so
far
to
preach
such
theology
what
had
happened
very
likely
was
that
one
of
the
more
austere
churchmen
who
visit
rutiaro
at
rare
intervals
had
condemned
those
white
man
s
comforts
as
injurious
to
health
he
must
have
been
severe
in
his
denunciation
for
puarei
had
got
the
idea
that
abstinence
from
the
enjoyment
of
them
was
exacted
in
a
sort
of
amendment
to
the
ten
commandments
i
did
my
best
to
corrupt
him
for
breakfast
at
his
house
was
to
me
a
cheerless
meal
his
faith
was
not
to
be
shaken
however
although
he
admitted
that
coffee
drinking
might
not
damn
me
since
i
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
it
would
not
i
was
thinking
with
pleasure
of
his
tolerance
and
of
the
comforting
beverage
i
should
have
the
following
morning
when
i
remembered
that
mine
was
green
tahiti
coffee
which
must
be
taken
to
moy
ling
for
roasting
his
shop
was
deserted
i
could
see
it
at
the
end
of
the
sunlit
street
steaming
with
moisture
after
the
rain
the
open
doorway
was
a
square
of
black
shadow
it
lightened
with
a
misty
glimmer
as
i
watched
and
suddenly
moy
flashed
into
view
he
ran
quickly
down
the
steps
halted
irresolutely
and
stood
for
a
moment
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
looking
in
the
direction
of
puarei
s
house
then
he
turned
mounted
the
steps
again
and
vanished
slowly
in
the
gloom
i
was
uneasy
knowing
what
he
was
thinking
but
an
island
less
than
three
miles
long
with
an
average
width
of
four
hundred
yards
offers
a
poor
refuge
for
a
debtor
and
so
having
stowed
my
other
purchases
under
the
guest
bed
i
took
the
bag
of
coffee
and
returned
to
moy
s
store
hoping
that
i
might
quiet
his
fears
by
increasing
my
obligation
to
him
when
one
is
without
them
clothing
coffee
tobacco
and
other
such
necessities
assume
a
place
of
exaggerated
importance
which
is
the
reason
why
the
memories
of
the
earlier
part
of
my
stay
at
rutiaro
are
tinged
with
the
thought
of
them
but
i
had
not
come
to
the
low
islands
to
spend
all
of
my
time
and
energy
in
the
mere
fight
for
a
comfortable
existence
i
could
have
done
that
quite
as
well
at
home
with
greater
results
in
the
development
of
a
more
or
less
resourcefulness
at
rutiaro
the
life
was
strange
and
new
to
me
and
i
found
the
days
too
short
for
observing
it
and
the
nights
for
reflecting
upon
it
my
first
interest
of
course
was
puarei
s
chief
his
wife
two
sons
and
three
daughters
all
housed
in
that
frame
building
the
room
was
commodious
however
about
feet
by
fifteen
and
on
the
lagoon
side
there
was
a
broad
veranda
where
poura
and
her
daughters
did
much
of
their
work
and
passed
their
hours
of
leisure
behind
the
house
was
a
large
cistern
built
of
blocks
of
cemented
coral
and
a
small
outkitchen
made
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
packing
cases
and
roofed
with
thatch
i
wondered
at
puarei
s
preference
for
a
board
box
covered
with
corrugated
iron
to
the
seemly
houses
of
the
other
rutiaroans
he
thought
it
a
palace
and
being
a
chief
the
richest
man
of
the
atoll
it
was
in
keeping
with
the
later
paumotuan
tradition
that
he
should
have
a
white
man
s
kind
of
dwelling
unsightly
though
it
was
without
the
economy
of
furnishing
gave
the
interior
an
air
of
pleasant
spaciousness
like
that
of
the
island
itself
with
its
scarcity
of
plant
life
and
of
trees
other
than
the
coconut
there
was
no
european
furniture
with
the
exception
of
a
sewing
machine
and
the
guest
bed
an
slatted
affair
which
looked
strange
in
that
environment
on
it
was
a
mattress
of
and
two
immense
pillows
filled
with
the
same
material
the
linen
was
immaculate
and
the
outer
coverlet
decorated
with
hibiscus
flowers
worked
in
silk
i
had
no
hesitation
in
accepting
the
bed
for
it
would
not
have
held
puarei
and
his
wife
the
slats
would
have
given
away
at
once
under
their
weight
and
poura
assured
me
that
the
children
preferred
sleeping
on
their
mats
on
the
veranda
the
rest
of
the
furnishings
were
like
those
of
the
other
or
three
chests
for
clothing
pandanus
mats
for
the
floor
paddles
fishing
spears
and
water
glasses
stacked
in
a
corner
or
lying
across
the
rafters
an
open
cabinet
of
native
manufacture
held
the
toilet
articles
of
the
hand
mirror
a
few
combs
and
a
bottle
of
unscented
coconut
oil
the
one
cosmetic
of
the
low
islands
which
was
used
by
all
members
of
the
family
there
were
also
several
articles
of
jewelry
such
as
the
traders
sell
some
fishing
hooks
of
pearl
shell
and
on
a
lower
shelf
a
tahitian
bible
the
walls
were
hung
with
branches
of
curiously
formed
coral
hat
wreaths
and
necklaces
of
shell
wrought
in
beautiful
and
intricate
designs
there
were
no
pictures
other
than
the
open
windows
looking
out
on
the
lagoon
in
one
direction
and
in
the
other
across
the
level
shaded
floor
of
the
island
toward
the
sea
we
spent
but
little
time
indoors
all
of
the
cooking
was
done
in
the
open
and
we
had
our
food
there
sitting
around
a
cloth
of
green
fronds
the
trees
around
us
furnished
the
dishes
i
had
not
used
my
tin
spoon
and
the
fork
since
the
evening
of
my
arrival
and
learned
to
suck
the
sauce
from
my
fingers
with
as
loud
a
zest
as
any
of
them
usually
we
had
two
meals
a
day
at
rutiaro
but
there
was
no
regularity
about
the
time
of
serving
them
we
ate
when
we
were
hungry
and
food
was
to
be
had
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
as
late
as
ten
in
the
evening
that
is
one
reason
why
i
remember
so
well
the
feasts
prepared
by
poura
and
her
daughters
and
served
by
them
for
they
never
sat
down
to
their
own
food
until
we
had
finished
feasts
of
a
simple
kind
but
by
jove
how
good
everything
tasted
after
a
day
of
fishing
and
swimming
in
the
lagoon
or
out
at
sea
i
didn
t
tire
of
coconuts
as
quickly
as
i
had
feared
i
should
and
the
fish
were
prepared
in
a
variety
of
roasted
over
hot
stones
grilled
on
the
coals
or
we
ate
them
raw
with
a
savor
of
sauce
puarei
s
dog
one
of
the
best
fishers
of
the
island
was
the
only
member
of
the
family
discriminating
in
his
requirements
he
often
came
up
while
we
were
at
dinner
with
a
live
fish
in
his
mouth
which
he
would
lay
at
poura
s
feet
looking
at
her
appealingly
until
she
cooked
it
for
him
sometimes
to
tease
him
she
threw
it
away
but
he
would
bring
it
back
and
no
matter
how
hungry
he
might
be
refuse
to
eat
it
raw
the
sea
furnished
occasional
variety
of
diet
in
the
way
of
turtles
and
devilfish
and
i
contributed
rice
tinned
meat
and
other
preserved
food
which
i
bought
of
moy
ling
whenever
i
imagined
his
confidence
in
me
was
beginning
to
falter
that
was
a
risky
procedure
only
to
be
undertaken
on
the
days
when
i
was
so
filled
with
animal
spirits
that
i
more
than
half
believed
in
my
wealth
in
my
power
to
draw
money
or
anything
else
i
wanted
out
of
the
clear
dry
air
of
rutiaro
one
thing
i
had
wanted
from
the
first
above
all
house
the
idea
of
imposing
indefinitely
upon
puarei
s
hospitality
was
distasteful
and
no
boats
were
expected
within
five
or
six
months
i
had
not
in
years
lived
for
so
long
a
period
at
any
one
place
here
was
an
opportunity
i
had
often
dreamed
of
for
having
a
home
of
my
own
i
should
have
to
ask
the
chief
for
it
and
at
first
thought
the
request
seemed
a
large
one
then
too
how
could
i
say
to
him
with
any
show
of
logic
puarei
i
am
not
willing
to
bother
you
longer
by
occupying
the
guest
bed
in
your
house
therefore
will
you
please
give
me
a
house
to
myself
he
might
think
i
had
peculiar
ideas
of
delicacy
but
further
reflection
convinced
me
that
while
i
could
not
ask
him
for
a
pair
of
even
for
so
trifling
a
thing
as
a
shirt
button
since
he
would
have
to
purchase
it
at
moy
ling
s
might
legitimately
suggest
the
gift
of
a
house
it
would
cost
only
the
labor
of
making
it
and
that
was
not
great
at
rutiaro
houses
were
built
in
less
time
than
was
needed
to
sail
across
the
lagoon
and
back
the
inhabitants
might
reasonably
have
adopted
the
early
chinese
method
of
roasting
pig
by
putting
the
carcasses
in
their
dwellings
and
setting
fire
to
the
thatch
it
would
have
been
a
sensible
procedure
employed
at
times
when
the
old
thatch
needed
renewal
nothing
permanent
would
have
been
destroyed
except
the
framework
of
poles
and
that
could
be
replaced
as
easily
as
firewood
could
be
cut
for
a
maori
oven
the
upshot
of
the
matter
was
that
i
was
given
not
only
a
house
but
an
island
of
my
own
to
set
it
who
had
lived
much
of
my
life
up
four
or
five
flights
of
stairs
in
furnished
rooms
looking
out
on
chimney
pots
and
brick
courts
filled
with
odors
and
family
washings
the
site
was
a
small
lying
at
the
entrance
to
the
lagoon
four
miles
from
the
village
island
it
had
a
name
which
meant
the
place
where
the
souls
were
eaten
once
a
man
his
wife
and
two
children
went
there
to
fish
on
the
reef
near
the
pass
all
of
them
were
taken
ill
of
some
mysterious
disease
and
died
on
the
same
day
as
their
souls
left
their
bodies
they
were
seized
and
eaten
by
some
vindictive
human
spirits
in
the
form
of
sea
birds
the
legend
was
evidently
a
very
ancient
one
and
the
events
which
it
described
had
happened
so
long
ago
that
fear
of
the
place
had
largely
vanished
nevertheless
the
chief
tried
to
persuade
me
to
choose
another
site
and
poura
when
she
learned
that
i
wanted
to
live
on
the
island
was
deeply
concerned
neither
of
them
could
understand
why
i
should
want
to
live
away
from
the
village
island
i
wince
even
now
when
i
think
of
the
appalling
tactlessness
of
that
request
but
the
fact
is
that
the
paumotuans
themselves
by
their
example
had
got
me
into
the
vicious
habit
of
in
such
matters
there
is
no
word
in
their
language
for
tact
they
believe
that
a
man
has
adequate
although
sometimes
hidden
reasons
for
doing
what
he
wants
to
do
and
they
understand
that
it
explains
seemingly
uncourtly
behavior
i
had
accepted
almost
unconsciously
their
own
point
of
view
so
that
it
didn
t
occur
to
me
to
invent
any
polite
falsehoods
but
my
knowledge
of
paumotuan
was
more
limited
than
paurei
s
knowledge
of
french
and
how
was
i
to
explain
my
desire
for
so
lonely
a
place
as
the
island
the
paumotuans
from
their
scarcity
of
numbers
the
isolation
of
their
fragments
of
land
the
dangers
of
the
sea
around
them
are
drawn
together
naturally
inevitably
how
make
clear
to
them
the
unnatural
gregariousness
of
life
in
great
cities
suddenly
i
thought
of
my
picture
post
card
of
the
woolworth
building
i
told
them
that
in
america
many
people
thousands
of
them
were
cooped
together
in
houses
of
that
sort
i
had
been
compelled
to
spend
several
years
in
one
and
had
got
such
a
horror
of
the
life
that
i
had
come
all
the
way
to
the
cloud
of
islands
searching
for
a
place
where
i
might
be
occasionally
alone
while
the
post
card
was
passing
from
hand
to
hand
huirai
the
constable
loyal
friend
in
every
emergency
gave
color
to
my
explanation
by
the
thousand
and
first
time
i
adventures
in
san
francisco
dusk
deepened
the
last
ghostly
light
faded
from
the
clouds
along
the
northern
horizon
and
still
he
talked
on
and
the
idlers
on
the
chief
s
veranda
listened
with
as
keen
interest
as
though
they
had
never
heard
the
story
before
poura
who
was
at
work
on
my
new
wardrobe
lit
a
lamp
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
beside
her
shading
it
from
her
eyes
with
a
piece
of
matting
the
light
ran
smoothly
over
her
brown
hands
and
the
mountain
of
shadow
behind
her
blotted
out
the
forms
of
the
trees
now
and
then
she
put
down
her
work
and
gazed
intently
in
huirai
s
direction
his
voice
rose
and
fell
thrilled
with
excitement
died
away
to
a
deep
whisper
of
awe
as
he
told
of
the
wonders
he
had
seen
the
street
cars
the
lofty
buildings
the
elevators
which
rose
to
an
immense
height
as
swiftly
as
a
coconut
would
fall
the
trains
the
motors
the
ships
the
pictures
which
were
alive
he
imitated
sounds
with
amazing
fidelity
and
his
gestures
vaguely
seen
in
the
gloom
were
vividly
pictorial
of
the
marvels
he
had
met
with
in
his
travels
the
story
ended
abruptly
and
huirai
sat
down
conscious
of
the
effect
he
had
produced
no
one
spoke
for
a
long
while
then
the
chief
who
was
sitting
beside
me
broke
the
silence
with
that
strange
polynesian
exclamation
of
wonder
too
great
for
words
uttered
with
distinct
rapid
precision
like
the
staccato
of
fire
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
knee
affectionately
with
an
air
of
possessorship
and
at
the
contact
a
feeling
of
pride
rose
in
me
as
though
i
were
the
planner
of
the
cities
the
magician
whose
brain
had
given
birth
to
the
marvels
huirai
had
described
but
conceit
of
that
kind
may
be
measurably
reduced
by
a
moment
of
reflection
and
i
remembered
that
the
extent
of
my
contribution
to
my
native
land
was
that
i
had
left
it
small
cause
for
vanity
there
however
i
had
no
mind
for
another
tussle
with
my
conscience
i
had
been
the
indirect
cause
of
eloquence
in
huirai
and
of
enjoyment
in
his
auditors
that
was
enough
for
one
evening
on
the
credit
side
on
the
other
side
to
puarei
to
poura
to
his
children
and
to
all
the
kindly
hospitable
people
of
rutiaro
i
was
under
an
obligation
which
i
could
never
hope
to
cancel
but
they
didn
t
expect
me
to
cancel
it
i
was
not
even
under
the
necessity
of
showing
appreciation
just
as
there
is
no
word
in
their
language
for
tact
there
is
none
approaching
our
word
gratitude
in
meaning
to
a
man
in
my
position
owner
of
island
and
of
a
house
to
be
built
there
the
following
day
that
was
something
to
be
grateful
for
the
chinese
language
is
richer
i
believe
in
terms
implying
obligation
i
was
reminded
less
pleasantly
of
another
account
on
the
debit
side
by
the
flare
of
a
match
which
lit
up
for
a
moment
the
pensive
cadaverous
face
of
moy
ling
illustration
chapter
vii
tailpiece
adventure
in
i
awoke
sometime
during
the
latter
part
of
the
night
with
the
bemused
presentiment
that
a
event
was
approaching
or
in
the
process
of
happening
hands
had
passed
lightly
over
my
that
or
i
had
dreamed
i
heard
a
faint
shout
coming
from
the
borderland
between
sleeping
and
waking
puarei
s
guest
bed
with
its
billowy
mattress
of
kapok
seemed
strangely
hard
which
led
to
the
discovery
that
i
was
not
lying
on
a
bed
but
on
a
mat
in
the
corner
of
an
empty
room
the
floor
was
covered
with
crushed
krora
shell
which
made
a
faint
radiance
in
the
gloom
and
a
roof
of
green
thatch
was
alight
with
the
reflections
of
moving
water
i
was
trying
to
puzzle
out
whose
house
this
could
be
when
i
heard
the
shout
again
clearly
this
time
in
a
pause
of
silence
between
deafening
claps
of
thunder
from
nearer
at
hand
came
the
sound
of
subdued
laughter
something
elfish
in
the
quality
of
it
stirred
a
dim
memory
and
there
flashed
into
mind
the
lines
of
an
old
poem
come
dear
children
come
out
and
play
the
moon
is
shining
as
bright
as
day
up
the
ladder
and
over
the
raising
my
head
quickly
i
saw
through
the
open
doorway
their
perfect
illustration
the
wall
was
the
smooth
wall
of
the
sea
with
a
waning
moon
rising
just
clear
of
it
sending
a
path
of
light
to
the
strip
of
white
beach
in
front
of
the
house
the
palm
trees
bordering
the
shore
swarmed
with
children
who
were
throwing
down
nuts
one
ancient
tree
its
stem
a
fantastic
curve
held
its
foliage
far
out
over
the
water
at
a
point
where
the
floor
of
the
narrow
outer
lagoon
shelved
steeply
toward
the
reef
some
fifty
yards
distant
both
boys
and
girls
were
shinning
up
the
trunk
one
after
the
other
diving
from
the
plumed
top
dropping
feet
foremost
jumping
with
their
hands
clasped
around
their
knees
into
the
foaming
wreckage
of
huge
combers
which
broke
on
the
reef
pouring
across
it
into
the
inner
shallows
a
second
group
had
gathered
in
the
moonlit
area
just
before
the
doorway
several
youngsters
were
peering
intently
in
my
direction
others
were
playing
a
sort
of
handclapping
game
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
odd
little
singsong
a
small
girl
with
a
baby
riding
astride
her
hip
walked
past
and
i
saw
another
of
ten
or
twelve
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
track
of
shimmering
light
holding
a
coconut
to
her
lips
with
both
hands
her
head
was
bent
far
back
and
her
hair
hung
free
from
her
shoulders
as
she
drained
the
cool
liquid
to
the
last
drop
imagine
coming
out
of
the
depths
of
sleep
to
the
consciousness
of
such
a
scene
i
was
hardly
more
sure
of
the
reality
of
it
than
i
had
been
of
the
shout
the
touch
of
hands
it
was
like
a
picture
out
of
a
book
of
fairy
tales
but
one
quick
with
life
the
figures
coming
and
going
against
a
background
of
empty
sea
where
the
long
swell
broke
in
lines
of
white
fire
on
a
ledge
of
coral
i
remembered
where
i
was
of
course
in
my
own
house
which
stood
on
the
ocean
side
of
a
small
motu
known
in
the
paumotuan
legend
as
the
island
where
the
souls
were
eaten
the
house
had
been
built
for
me
only
the
day
before
by
the
order
of
puarei
chief
of
the
atoll
of
rutiaro
and
the
motu
was
one
of
a
dozen
uninhabited
islands
which
lay
on
the
circumference
to
the
lagoons
it
was
chance
which
took
me
there
i
was
never
to
see
the
place
in
the
clear
light
of
usual
experience
but
rather
through
a
glamour
like
that
of
remembered
long
succession
of
dreams
in
which
night
after
night
events
shape
themselves
according
to
the
heart
s
desire
or
even
more
fantastically
with
an
airy
disregard
for
any
semblance
to
reality
so
it
was
waking
from
sleep
on
the
first
night
which
i
spent
under
my
own
roof
i
was
almost
ready
to
believe
that
my
presence
there
was
not
the
result
of
chance
waywardness
of
fancy
is
one
of
the
most
godlike
of
the
attributes
of
that
divinity
but
the
display
of
it
is
as
likely
as
not
to
be
unfriendly
here
there
seemed
to
be
reasoned
kindly
action
providence
i
said
to
providence
without
a
doubt
a
little
repentant
perhaps
because
of
questionable
gifts
in
the
past
a
whimsical
providence
too
which
delighted
in
shocking
my
sense
of
probability
what
could
those
children
be
doing
on
island
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
myself
had
left
the
village
island
four
miles
distant
only
a
few
hours
earlier
and
at
that
time
everyone
was
asleep
there
was
not
a
sound
of
human
activity
in
the
settlement
not
a
glimmer
of
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
excepting
in
moy
ling
s
the
chinaman
s
shop
and
on
the
surface
of
the
lagoon
where
lay
the
misty
reflections
of
the
stars
perhaps
i
thought
these
are
not
earthly
children
maybe
they
are
the
ghosts
of
those
whose
souls
were
eaten
here
so
many
years
ago
i
was
more
than
half
serious
in
thinking
of
that
possibility
stranger
things
had
happened
on
islands
not
so
far
removed
from
the
world
of
men
i
dressed
very
quietly
and
went
to
the
door
taking
care
to
keep
well
in
the
shadow
so
that
i
might
look
on
for
a
moment
without
being
seen
my
doubts
vanished
at
once
not
only
the
children
had
come
out
to
play
fathers
and
mothers
as
well
tamitanga
was
there
and
rikitia
and
nahea
and
pohu
and
tahere
and
hunga
and
tamataha
manono
havaiki
and
i
saw
old
rangituki
who
was
at
least
seventy
and
a
grandmother
several
times
over
clapping
her
hands
with
others
of
her
generation
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
in
time
to
the
music
of
kaupia
s
accordion
all
the
older
people
were
grouped
around
puarei
who
was
seated
in
an
old
deck
chair
a
sort
of
throne
which
was
carried
about
for
him
wherever
he
went
poura
his
wife
lay
on
a
mat
beside
him
her
chin
propped
on
her
hands
both
greeted
me
cordially
but
offered
no
explanation
for
the
reason
of
the
midnight
visit
i
was
glad
that
they
didn
t
i
liked
the
casualness
of
it
which
was
quite
in
keeping
with
habits
of
life
at
rutiaro
but
i
couldn
t
help
smiling
remembering
my
reflections
earlier
in
the
evening
i
believed
then
that
i
was
crossing
the
threshold
of
what
was
to
be
an
adventure
in
solitude
and
was
in
a
mood
of
absurdly
youthful
elation
at
the
prospect
i
was
to
delve
deeply
for
the
first
time
into
my
own
resources
against
loneliness
i
had
known
the
solitude
of
cities
but
there
one
has
the
comfortable
sense
of
nearness
to
others
the
refuge
of
books
pictures
the
distractions
which
prevent
any
very
searching
examination
of
one
s
capacity
for
a
life
of
retirement
at
island
i
would
have
no
books
no
pictures
excepting
a
colored
post
card
of
the
woolworth
building
which
had
won
me
this
opportunity
and
for
music
i
was
limited
to
what
i
could
make
for
myself
with
my
my
whistle
which
had
a
range
of
one
octave
thus
scantly
provided
with
diversions
i
was
to
learn
how
far
my
own
thoughts
would
serve
to
make
a
solitary
life
not
only
endurable
but
pleasant
so
i
had
dreamed
as
i
paddled
down
the
lagoon
with
my
island
taking
form
against
the
starlit
sky
to
the
eastward
it
was
one
of
those
places
which
set
one
to
dreaming
which
seem
fashioned
by
nature
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
definite
kind
of
experience
seeing
it
whether
by
day
or
by
night
the
most
gregarious
of
men
i
am
sure
would
have
become
suddenly
enamored
of
his
own
companionship
and
the
most
prosaic
would
have
discovered
a
second
meditative
self
which
pleads
for
indulgence
with
gentle
obstinacy
but
alas
my
own
unsocial
nature
gained
but
a
barren
victory
being
robbed
at
the
outset
of
the
fruits
of
it
by
the
convivial
inhabitants
of
rutiaro
here
within
six
hours
was
half
the
village
at
my
door
and
puarei
told
me
that
the
rest
of
it
or
as
many
as
were
provided
with
canoes
was
following
evidently
he
had
suggested
the
invasion
my
new
house
needed
the
paumotuan
equivalent
to
that
they
had
come
to
warm
it
preparations
were
being
made
on
an
elaborate
scale
the
children
were
gathering
green
nuts
for
drinking
and
fronds
for
the
cloth
at
the
feast
women
and
girls
were
grating
the
meat
of
ripe
nuts
pressing
out
the
milk
for
the
cleaning
fish
preparing
shells
for
dishes
some
of
the
men
and
the
older
boys
were
building
native
of
them
each
one
large
enough
for
roasting
a
pig
all
of
this
work
was
being
carried
out
under
puarei
s
direction
and
to
the
accompaniment
of
kaupia
s
accordion
i
wish
that
i
might
in
some
way
make
real
to
others
the
unreal
loveliness
of
the
scene
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
took
place
on
one
of
the
loneliest
of
a
lonely
cloud
of
islands
which
lay
in
the
midmost
solitude
of
an
empty
ocean
the
moonlight
must
be
remembered
too
and
how
it
lay
in
splinters
of
silver
on
the
motionless
fronds
of
the
palms
as
though
it
were
of
the
very
texture
of
their
polished
surfaces
and
you
must
hear
kaupia
s
accordion
and
the
shouts
of
the
children
as
they
dove
into
the
pool
of
silvered
foam
the
older
ones
out
of
respect
to
me
i
think
wore
wisps
of
parou
cloth
about
their
loins
but
the
babies
were
as
naked
as
on
the
day
they
were
born
tereki
was
standing
among
these
who
were
too
small
for
the
climb
to
the
diving
place
taking
them
up
sometimes
two
at
once
and
tossing
them
into
the
pool
among
the
others
where
they
were
as
much
at
home
as
so
many
minnows
watching
them
i
thought
with
regret
of
my
own
lost
opportunities
as
a
child
i
felt
a
deep
pity
for
all
the
children
of
civilization
who
must
wear
clothing
and
who
never
know
the
joy
of
playing
at
midnight
and
by
moonlight
too
mothers
clubs
and
organizations
would
do
well
to
consider
the
advisability
of
repealing
the
old
to
bed
at
seven
law
the
bugbear
of
all
children
its
only
merits
if
it
may
be
so
called
is
that
it
fosters
in
children
a
certain
melancholy
intellectual
enjoyment
in
such
poems
as
up
the
ladder
and
over
the
wall
where
the
forbidden
pleasures
are
held
out
to
them
as
though
they
were
natural
most
of
them
are
of
quite
possible
of
attainment
i
was
sorry
that
tino
supercargo
of
the
could
not
be
present
to
see
how
blithely
the
work
went
forward
he
had
called
the
people
of
rutiaro
a
lazy
lot
and
he
was
were
lazy
according
to
the
standards
of
temperate
climates
but
when
they
worked
toward
an
end
which
pleased
them
their
industry
was
astonishing
tino
s
belief
was
that
man
was
made
to
labor
whether
joyfully
or
not
in
order
that
he
might
increase
his
wealth
whether
he
needed
it
or
not
and
that
of
the
world
at
large
i
remember
meeting
somewhat
the
same
point
of
view
in
reading
the
lives
and
memoirs
of
some
of
the
old
missionaries
to
the
islands
it
seems
to
have
irked
them
terribly
finding
a
people
who
had
never
heard
that
doleful
hymn
work
for
the
night
is
coming
they
too
believed
that
the
needs
of
the
polynesians
should
be
increased
but
for
ethical
reasons
in
order
that
they
should
be
compelled
to
cultivate
regular
habits
of
industry
in
order
to
satisfy
them
although
i
didn
t
agree
with
it
tino
s
seemed
to
me
the
sounder
conviction
the
missionaries
might
have
argued
as
reasonably
for
a
general
distribution
of
boils
in
order
that
the
virtues
of
patience
and
fortitude
might
have
wider
dissemination
but
neither
trade
nor
religion
had
altered
to
any
noticeable
extent
the
habits
of
life
at
rutiaro
the
people
worked
as
they
had
always
done
under
the
press
of
necessity
their
simple
needs
being
satisfied
their
inertia
was
a
thing
to
marvel
at
i
have
often
seen
them
sitting
for
hours
at
a
time
moving
only
with
the
shadows
which
sheltered
them
there
was
something
in
their
immobility
in
their
attitude
of
profound
reverie
i
felt
at
times
that
i
was
living
in
a
land
under
a
perpetual
enchantment
of
silence
and
sleep
these
periods
of
as
tino
would
say
usually
brought
to
an
end
by
puarei
it
was
a
fascinating
thing
to
watch
him
throwing
off
the
enchantment
so
gradual
the
process
was
and
so
strange
the
contrast
when
he
was
thoroughly
awakened
and
had
roused
the
village
from
its
long
sleep
then
would
follow
a
period
of
copra
making
canoe
building
whatever
there
was
to
do
would
be
done
not
speedily
perhaps
but
smoothly
and
fasts
would
be
the
case
of
many
of
the
villagers
for
the
first
time
in
two
or
three
days
my
house
was
built
during
such
a
period
i
was
still
living
with
puarei
on
the
village
island
wondering
when
if
ever
i
was
to
have
the
promised
dwelling
then
one
afternoon
while
i
was
absent
on
a
expedition
the
village
set
out
for
island
cut
the
timbers
branded
the
fronds
erected
swept
and
garnished
my
house
and
were
at
the
settlement
again
before
i
myself
had
returned
that
task
finished
here
they
were
back
for
the
warming
festival
and
the
energy
spent
in
preparing
for
it
would
have
more
than
loaded
tino
s
schooner
with
copra
i
couldn
t
flatter
myself
that
all
of
this
was
done
solely
to
give
me
pleasure
they
found
pleasure
in
it
too
and
furthermore
i
knew
that
an
unusually
long
interval
of
fasting
called
for
compensation
in
the
way
of
feasting
puarei
was
in
a
gay
mood
religion
sat
rather
heavily
upon
him
virtue
of
his
papeete
schooling
he
was
the
chief
elder
of
his
church
but
once
he
sloughed
off
his
air
of
latter
day
saintliness
he
made
a
splendid
master
of
revels
and
he
threw
it
aside
the
moment
the
drums
began
to
beat
and
led
a
dozen
of
the
younger
men
in
a
dance
which
i
had
not
seen
before
it
was
very
much
like
modern
swedish
drill
set
to
music
except
that
the
movements
were
as
intricate
and
graceful
as
they
were
exhausting
three
kinds
of
drums
were
an
empty
gasoline
tin
upon
which
the
drummer
kept
up
a
steady
roll
while
the
dance
was
in
progress
the
rhythm
for
the
movements
was
indicated
by
three
others
two
of
them
beating
hollowed
cylinders
of
wood
while
a
third
was
provided
with
an
old
french
army
drum
of
the
napoleonic
period
the
syncopation
was
extraordinary
measures
were
divided
in
an
amazing
variety
of
ways
and
often
when
the
opportunity
seemed
lost
the
fragments
joined
perfectly
just
as
the
next
one
was
at
hand
the
music
was
a
kaleidoscope
in
sound
made
up
of
unique
and
startling
variations
in
tempo
as
the
dance
moved
from
one
figure
to
the
next
at
the
close
of
it
kaupia
took
up
her
accordion
again
and
dancing
by
some
of
the
women
followed
at
length
rangituki
grandmother
though
she
was
could
resist
the
music
no
longer
the
others
gave
way
to
her
and
in
a
moment
she
was
dancing
alone
proudly
with
a
sort
of
wistful
abandon
as
though
she
were
remembering
her
youth
throwing
a
last
defiance
in
the
teeth
of
time
kaupia
sang
as
she
played
to
an
air
which
had
but
four
changes
in
it
the
verse
was
five
words
long
and
repeated
endlessly
tu
fra
to
potta
mi
tu
fra
to
potta
mi
both
the
words
and
the
air
had
a
familiar
sound
they
called
to
mind
a
shadowy
picture
of
three
tall
thin
women
in
spangled
skirts
all
of
them
beating
tambourines
in
unison
and
dancing
in
front
of
a
painted
screen
i
couldn
t
account
for
the
strange
vision
at
first
it
glimmered
faintly
far
in
the
depths
of
subconscious
memory
like
a
colored
newspaper
supplement
lying
in
murky
water
at
the
end
of
a
pier
suddenly
it
rose
into
focus
drawn
to
the
surface
by
the
buoyant
splendor
of
a
cherry
sisters
i
remembered
then
a
vaudeville
troupe
which
long
ago
made
sorry
capital
of
its
lack
of
comeliness
and
i
saw
them
again
on
the
island
where
the
souls
were
eaten
as
clearly
as
ever
i
had
as
a
youngster
knocking
their
tambourines
on
bony
elbows
shaking
their
curls
and
singing
shoe
fly
don
t
bother
me
in
shrill
cracked
voices
kaupia
s
version
was
merely
a
phonetic
translation
of
the
words
they
meant
nothing
in
the
paumotuan
dialect
woman
though
she
s
dance
which
accompanied
the
music
played
in
faster
and
faster
time
was
in
striking
contrast
to
the
angular
movements
of
the
cherry
sisters
tripping
it
in
the
background
across
the
dim
footlights
of
the
eighteen
nineties
other
canoes
were
arriving
during
this
time
and
at
last
a
large
canoe
which
had
put
off
from
the
ocean
side
of
the
village
island
was
seen
making
in
toward
the
pass
it
was
loaded
with
pigs
and
chickens
the
most
important
part
of
the
feast
and
had
been
eagerly
awaited
for
more
than
an
hour
shouts
of
anticipation
went
up
from
the
shore
as
the
boat
drew
in
with
its
freight
but
these
were
a
little
premature
there
was
a
stretch
of
ugly
broken
water
to
be
passed
where
the
swift
ebb
from
the
lagoon
met
the
swell
of
the
open
sea
the
canoe
was
badly
jostled
in
crossing
it
and
some
of
the
chickens
having
worked
loose
from
their
bonds
escaped
like
the
dogs
of
the
atolls
the
chickens
are
of
a
wild
breed
and
they
took
the
air
with
sturdy
wings
the
chase
from
the
shore
began
at
once
but
it
was
a
hopeless
one
island
is
five
hundred
yards
long
by
three
hundred
broad
and
there
is
another
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pass
which
is
more
than
a
mile
in
extent
we
made
frantic
efforts
to
prevent
them
from
reaching
it
we
threw
sticks
and
stones
tried
to
entice
them
with
broken
coconuts
the
meat
temptingly
accessible
it
was
to
no
purpose
they
had
been
enticed
before
their
crops
were
full
and
several
hours
of
captivity
had
made
them
wary
furthermore
like
all
polynesian
chickens
they
seemed
to
have
a
racial
memory
of
what
they
had
been
in
other
times
in
less
congenial
the
lean
days
when
they
had
been
caught
and
eaten
at
will
chased
by
dogs
run
down
by
horses
they
were
not
so
far
from
all
that
as
to
have
lost
conscious
pride
in
their
regained
prerogative
of
flight
the
last
we
saw
of
them
they
were
using
it
to
splendid
advantage
over
the
rapid
stream
which
separated
the
two
islands
one
old
hen
alone
remained
perched
in
the
top
of
a
coconut
tree
on
island
she
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
she
knew
that
she
could
follow
the
others
whenever
she
liked
and
she
knew
that
we
knew
it
she
seemed
drunk
with
a
sense
of
freedom
and
power
and
cackled
proudly
as
though
more
than
half
convinced
that
the
nuts
clustered
in
the
nest
of
foliage
beneath
her
were
eggs
which
she
had
laid
knowing
the
wholesomeness
of
the
paumotuan
appetite
i
could
understand
why
the
loss
of
the
chickens
was
regarded
seriously
a
dozen
of
them
remained
and
we
had
eight
pigs
weighing
from
one
hundred
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
each
to
say
nothing
of
some
fifty
pounds
of
fish
all
of
this
was
good
in
so
far
as
it
went
but
there
was
a
gloomy
shaking
of
heads
as
we
returned
from
our
fruitless
chase
not
that
the
paumotuans
are
particularly
fond
of
chicken
on
the
contrary
they
don
t
care
greatly
for
fowl
of
any
sort
but
it
serves
to
fill
odd
corners
of
their
capacious
stomachs
it
was
this
they
were
thinking
of
and
the
possible
lack
at
the
end
of
the
feast
of
the
feeling
of
almost
painful
satiety
which
is
to
them
an
essential
sensation
in
this
emergency
i
contributed
four
tins
of
beef
and
salmon
my
entire
stock
of
substantial
provisions
for
the
adventure
in
solitude
but
i
could
see
that
puarei
as
well
as
the
others
regarded
this
as
a
mere
wholly
acceptable
but
light
course
of
fortunately
there
was
at
hand
an
inexhaustible
reservoir
of
we
prepared
to
go
there
for
further
supplies
i
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
witness
those
expeditions
once
i
had
tried
my
hand
as
a
participant
and
found
myself
as
dangerously
out
of
my
element
as
a
paumotuan
would
be
at
the
joy
stick
of
an
airplane
i
saw
a
great
many
fish
but
i
could
not
have
speared
one
of
them
if
it
had
been
moored
to
the
bottom
and
after
a
few
absurd
attempts
was
myself
fished
into
the
boat
half
drowned
i
lay
there
for
a
few
minutes
gasping
for
breath
my
ear
drums
throbbing
painfully
from
the
attempt
to
reach
unaccustomed
depths
the
experiment
convinced
me
that
fish
spearing
in
the
open
sea
is
not
an
easily
acquired
art
but
one
handed
down
in
its
perfection
through
at
least
twenty
generations
of
low
island
ancestors
it
is
falling
into
disuse
in
some
of
the
atolls
where
wealth
is
accumulating
and
tinned
food
plentiful
but
the
inhabitants
of
rutiaro
still
follow
it
with
zest
they
handle
their
spears
affectionately
as
anglers
handle
and
sort
their
lies
these
are
true
sportsman
s
weapons
provided
with
a
single
unbarbed
dart
bound
with
sinnet
to
a
tapering
shaft
from
eight
to
ten
feet
long
their
water
goggles
like
their
spears
they
make
for
themselves
they
are
somewhat
like
an
aviator
s
goggles
disks
of
clear
glass
fitted
in
brass
rims
with
an
inner
cushion
of
rubber
which
cups
closely
around
the
eyes
preventing
the
entrance
of
water
when
adjusted
they
give
the
wearer
an
owlish
appearance
like
the
spectacles
which
used
to
be
affected
by
american
undergraduates
thus
equipped
with
their
girded
into
loin
cloths
a
half
dozen
of
the
younger
men
jumped
into
the
rapid
current
which
flows
past
island
and
swam
out
to
sea
tohetika
tehina
pinga
the
boat
steerer
and
i
followed
in
a
canoe
dawn
was
at
hand
and
looking
back
i
saw
the
island
my
house
and
the
crowd
on
the
beach
in
the
suffused
unreal
light
of
sun
and
fading
moon
in
front
of
us
the
swimmers
were
already
approaching
the
tumbled
waters
at
the
entrance
to
the
pass
upon
reaching
it
they
disappeared
together
and
i
next
saw
them
far
on
the
other
side
swimming
in
a
direction
parallel
to
the
reef
and
some
fifty
yards
beyond
the
breaking
point
of
the
surf
when
we
joined
them
the
sun
was
above
the
horizon
and
they
were
already
at
the
sport
they
lay
face
down
on
the
surface
of
the
water
turning
their
heads
now
and
then
for
a
breath
of
air
they
swam
with
an
easy
breast
stroke
and
a
barely
perceptible
movement
of
the
legs
holding
their
spears
with
their
toes
near
the
end
of
the
long
shaft
riding
the
long
smooth
swell
it
was
hard
to
keep
them
in
view
and
they
were
diving
repeatedly
coming
to
the
surface
again
at
unexpected
places
through
the
clear
water
i
could
see
every
crevice
and
cranny
in
the
shelving
slope
of
coral
the
mouths
of
gloomy
caverns
which
undermined
the
reef
and
swarms
of
fish
as
strangely
colored
as
the
coral
itself
passing
through
them
flashing
across
sunlit
spaces
or
hovering
in
the
shadows
of
overhanging
ledges
it
was
a
strange
world
to
look
down
upon
and
stranger
still
to
see
men
moving
about
in
it
as
though
it
were
their
natural
home
sometimes
they
grasped
their
spears
as
a
poniard
would
be
held
for
a
downward
blow
sometimes
with
the
thumb
forward
thrusting
with
an
underhand
movement
they
were
marvelously
quick
and
accurate
at
striking
i
had
a
nicer
appreciation
of
their
skill
after
my
one
attempt
which
had
proven
to
me
how
difficult
it
is
to
judge
precisely
the
distance
the
location
of
the
prey
and
the
second
for
the
thrust
a
novice
was
helpless
he
suffered
under
the
heavy
pressure
of
the
water
and
the
long
holding
of
his
breath
cost
him
agonized
effort
even
though
he
were
comfortable
physically
he
might
chase
with
as
good
result
the
dancing
reflections
of
a
mirror
turned
this
way
and
that
in
the
sunlight
as
they
searched
the
depths
to
the
seaward
side
the
bodies
of
the
fishers
grew
shadowy
vanished
altogether
reappeared
as
they
passed
over
a
lighter
background
of
blue
or
green
which
marked
an
invisible
shoal
at
last
they
would
come
clearly
into
view
the
spear
held
erect
rising
like
embodied
spirits
through
an
element
of
matchless
purity
which
seemed
neither
air
nor
water
the
whistling
noises
which
they
made
as
they
regained
the
surface
gave
the
last
touch
of
unreality
to
the
scene
i
have
never
understood
the
reason
for
this
practice
which
is
universal
among
the
divers
and
fishers
of
the
low
islands
unless
it
is
that
their
lungs
being
famished
for
air
they
breathe
it
out
grudgingly
through
teeth
heard
against
the
thunder
of
the
surf
the
sounds
hoarse
or
shrill
according
to
the
wont
of
the
diver
seemed
anything
but
human
we
returned
in
an
hour
s
time
with
the
canoe
half
filled
with
silvery
brown
spotted
we
had
more
than
made
good
the
loss
of
the
chickens
the
preparations
for
the
feast
had
been
completed
the
table
was
set
or
better
the
cloth
of
green
fronds
was
laid
on
the
ground
near
the
beach
at
each
place
there
was
a
tin
of
my
corned
beef
or
salmon
the
half
of
a
coconut
shell
filled
with
raw
fish
cut
into
small
pieces
in
a
sauce
of
coconut
a
green
coconut
for
drinking
along
the
center
of
the
table
were
great
piles
of
fish
baked
and
raw
roast
pork
and
chicken
mounds
of
bread
stacked
up
like
cannon
balls
the
bread
was
not
of
moy
ling
s
baking
but
made
in
native
of
boiled
dough
of
the
size
and
weight
of
large
grape
fruit
one
would
think
that
the
most
optimistic
stomach
would
ache
at
the
prospect
of
receiving
it
but
the
paumotuan
stomach
is
of
ostrichlike
hardihood
and
as
i
have
said
after
long
fasting
it
demands
quantity
rather
than
quality
in
food
it
was
then
about
half
past
six
a
seasonable
hour
for
the
feast
for
the
air
was
still
cool
and
fresh
the
food
was
steaming
on
the
table
but
we
were
not
yet
ready
to
sit
down
to
it
fête
days
like
sundays
required
costumes
appropriate
to
the
occasion
and
everyone
retired
into
the
bush
to
change
clothing
i
thought
then
that
i
was
to
be
the
only
disreputable
banqueter
of
the
lot
and
regretted
that
i
had
been
so
eager
to
see
my
new
house
not
expecting
visitors
i
had
come
away
from
the
village
with
only
my
supply
of
food
fortunately
puarei
had
been
thoughtful
for
me
i
found
not
only
my
white
clothing
but
my
other
of
ribbon
perfume
the
cheap
jewelry
which
i
had
bought
on
credit
of
moy
ling
and
the
house
itself
had
been
furnished
and
decorated
during
the
hour
when
i
was
out
with
the
fish
spearers
there
was
a
table
and
a
chair
made
of
bits
of
old
packing
cases
in
one
corner
and
on
the
sleeping
mat
a
crazy
quilt
and
a
pillow
with
my
name
worked
in
red
silk
within
a
border
of
flowers
hanging
from
the
ceiling
was
a
faded
bell
the
kind
one
sees
in
grocers
windows
at
home
at
christmas
time
this
was
originally
the
gift
of
some
trader
and
the
pictures
too
which
decorated
the
walls
they
had
been
cut
from
the
advertising
pages
of
some
american
magazine
one
of
them
represented
a
man
dressed
in
a
brand
of
underwear
who
was
smiling
with
cool
solicitude
at
two
others
who
were
perspiring
heavily
and
the
legend
printed
beneath
was
their
underwear
bore
the
same
stamp
as
that
of
their
fortunate
comrade
there
was
another
in
color
of
a
woman
smiling
across
a
table
at
her
husband
who
smiled
back
while
they
ate
a
particular
brand
of
beans
the
four
walls
of
my
house
were
hung
with
pictures
of
this
sort
strung
on
cords
of
coconut
s
work
i
was
sure
done
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
heart
he
was
merely
an
unconscious
agent
of
the
gods
administering
this
further
reproof
for
my
temerity
in
seeking
consciously
an
adventure
in
solitude
as
i
changed
my
clothing
i
pondered
the
problem
as
to
how
i
could
get
rid
of
the
gallery
without
giving
huirai
offense
and
from
this
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
people
smiling
down
at
me
is
our
race
made
up
in
large
part
of
such
materialists
whose
chief
joy
in
life
lies
in
discovering
some
hitherto
untried
brand
of
soup
or
talcum
powder
do
they
live
these
people
they
looked
real
enough
in
the
picture
i
seemed
to
know
many
of
them
and
i
remembered
their
innumerable
prototypes
i
had
met
in
the
world
i
had
left
only
the
year
before
well
if
they
are
real
i
thought
what
has
become
of
the
old
doomsday
men
and
women
who
used
to
stand
at
street
corners
with
bundles
of
tracts
in
their
hands
saying
to
my
friend
is
your
soul
saved
no
answer
came
from
the
smiling
materialists
on
all
sides
of
me
they
smiled
still
as
though
in
mockery
of
my
attempt
to
elude
them
in
whatsoever
unfrequented
corner
of
the
world
as
though
life
were
merely
the
endless
enjoyment
of
creature
comforts
the
endless
effortless
use
of
devices
one
man
in
his
late
fifties
who
really
ought
to
have
been
thinking
about
his
soul
had
in
his
eyes
only
the
light
of
sensual
gratification
he
was
in
pajamas
and
half
shaven
announcing
to
me
to
the
world
at
large
at
last
a
razor
the
sight
of
him
offering
me
his
useful
little
instrument
put
an
end
to
my
meditation
i
rubbed
ruefully
a
three
days
growth
of
beard
thinking
of
the
torture
in
store
for
me
when
i
should
next
go
to
pinga
for
a
shave
he
was
the
village
barber
as
well
as
its
most
skillful
boat
steerer
his
other
customers
were
used
to
his
razor
and
his
methods
and
their
faces
were
inured
to
pain
for
had
not
their
ancestors
through
countless
generations
had
their
beards
plucked
out
hair
by
hair
i
on
the
other
hand
was
the
creature
of
my
own
land
of
creature
comforts
the
anticipation
of
a
shave
was
agony
and
the
sitting
on
my
chest
holding
my
head
firm
with
one
immense
hand
while
he
scraped
and
rasped
with
his
dull
was
to
die
weekly
and
to
live
to
die
again
i
got
what
amusement
i
could
from
the
thought
of
the
different
set
of
values
at
rutiaro
i
had
only
to
ask
for
a
house
and
puarei
had
given
me
one
with
an
island
of
my
own
to
set
it
on
he
thought
no
more
of
the
request
than
if
i
had
asked
him
for
a
drinking
coconut
but
not
all
the
wealth
of
the
low
island
pearl
fisheries
had
it
been
mine
to
offer
could
have
procured
for
me
a
safety
razor
with
a
dozen
good
blades
i
heard
puarei
shouting
mai
ta
maa
and
went
out
to
join
the
others
my
unshaved
beard
in
woeful
contrast
to
my
immaculate
white
clothing
but
my
guests
or
hosts
had
the
native
courtesy
of
many
primitive
people
and
i
was
not
made
conscious
of
my
unreaped
chin
furthermore
everyone
was
hungry
and
so
after
puarei
had
said
grace
for
the
church
of
latter
day
saints
and
huirai
a
second
one
for
the
reformed
church
of
latter
day
saints
and
a
third
as
the
catholic
representative
we
fell
to
without
further
loss
of
time
the
enjoyment
of
food
is
assuredly
one
of
the
great
blessings
of
life
although
it
is
not
a
cause
for
perpetual
smiling
as
the
writers
of
advertisements
would
have
one
believe
according
to
the
low
island
way
of
thinking
it
is
not
a
subject
to
be
talked
about
at
any
length
i
liked
their
custom
of
eating
in
silence
with
everyone
giving
undivided
attention
to
the
business
in
hand
it
gave
one
the
privilege
of
doing
likewise
a
relief
to
a
man
weary
of
the
unnatural
dining
habits
of
more
advanced
people
it
may
be
a
trifle
gross
to
think
of
your
food
while
you
are
eating
it
but
it
is
natural
and
if
the
doctors
are
to
be
believed
an
excellent
aid
to
digestion
now
and
then
puarei
would
say
mea
maitai
a
thing
good
that
tapping
a
haunch
of
roast
pork
with
his
forefinger
and
i
would
reply
é
mea
maitai
roa
yes
a
thing
very
good
that
then
we
would
fall
to
eating
again
on
my
right
hunga
went
from
fish
to
pork
and
from
pork
to
tinned
beef
whipping
the
to
his
lips
with
his
fingers
without
the
loss
of
a
drop
only
once
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
let
his
eyes
wander
the
length
of
the
table
shaking
his
head
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
he
said
ahuru
food
and
yet
more
food
there
is
no
phrase
sweeter
to
paumotuan
ears
than
that
one
huirai
the
constable
was
the
only
one
who
made
any
social
demands
upon
me
as
already
related
he
had
once
made
a
journey
from
papeete
to
san
francisco
as
a
stoker
on
one
of
the
mail
boats
and
was
immensely
proud
of
the
few
english
phrases
which
he
had
picked
up
during
the
voyage
he
didn
t
know
the
meaning
of
them
but
that
made
no
difference
he
could
put
on
side
before
the
others
make
them
believe
that
he
was
carrying
on
an
intelligent
conversation
what
s
the
matter
oh
yes
never
mind
were
among
his
favorite
mild
ones
it
seemed
to
me
for
one
who
had
been
associated
with
a
gang
of
cockney
stokers
and
he
brought
them
out
apropos
of
nothing
he
was
an
exasperating
old
hypocrite
but
a
genial
one
and
i
couldn
t
help
replying
to
some
of
his
feints
at
conversation
once
out
of
curiosity
wondering
what
his
reply
would
be
i
said
huirai
you
re
the
worst
old
in
the
islands
aren
t
you
he
smiled
and
nodded
and
came
back
with
the
most
telling
of
all
his
phrases
you
go
to
hell
me
on
that
occasion
it
was
delivered
with
what
seemed
something
more
than
mere
parrotlike
aptness
of
reply
clipped
to
his
undershirt
he
wore
a
fountain
pen
which
was
as
much
a
part
of
his
costume
on
those
dress
occasions
as
his
dungaree
trousers
and
pandanus
hat
it
had
a
broken
point
was
always
dry
and
although
huirai
read
fairly
well
he
could
hardly
write
his
own
name
no
matter
he
would
no
more
have
forgotten
his
pen
than
a
french
soldier
his
de
but
he
was
not
alone
in
his
love
for
these
implements
of
the
white
man
s
culture
there
was
havaiki
for
example
who
owned
a
small
folding
camera
which
he
had
bought
from
some
trader
the
two
men
were
very
jealous
of
each
other
huirai
had
traveled
and
had
a
fountain
pen
but
havaiki
s
camera
was
a
much
more
complicated
instrument
there
had
never
been
any
films
for
it
but
he
was
quite
satisfied
without
them
the
camera
stood
on
a
shelf
at
his
house
an
proof
of
his
better
title
to
distinction
his
chief
regret
i
believe
was
that
he
couldn
t
wear
it
as
huarai
did
his
pen
but
he
often
carried
it
with
him
on
sundays
and
went
through
the
pretense
of
taking
pictures
some
of
the
more
sanguine
still
believed
that
he
would
one
day
surprise
the
village
by
producing
a
large
number
of
magnificent
photographs
a
further
account
of
the
feast
at
island
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
detailed
statement
of
the
amount
of
food
consumed
and
it
would
not
be
credited
as
truthful
it
is
enough
to
say
that
it
was
a
latter
day
miracle
comparable
to
the
feeding
of
the
five
thousand
with
this
reversal
of
the
food
for
approximately
that
number
was
eaten
by
men
at
last
puarei
sat
back
with
a
groan
of
content
and
said
paia
huru
paia
to
it
is
impossible
to
translate
this
literally
but
the
exact
meaning
is
we
are
all
of
us
full
up
to
the
neck
it
was
true
we
were
that
is
all
of
the
men
the
women
and
children
were
waiting
and
as
soon
as
we
gave
them
place
they
set
to
on
the
remnants
fortunately
there
was
as
hunga
had
said
food
and
yet
more
food
so
that
no
one
went
hungry
at
the
close
of
the
feast
i
saw
old
rangituki
take
a
fragment
of
coconut
frond
and
weave
it
into
a
neat
basket
then
she
gathered
into
it
all
of
the
fish
bones
and
hung
the
basket
from
one
of
the
rafters
of
my
house
rangituki
was
pure
heathen
one
of
the
unredeemed
of
the
rutiaroans
but
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
catholics
and
latter
day
saints
even
the
reformed
saints
of
the
later
latter
day
persuasion
all
in
good
standing
in
their
churches
assisted
her
in
making
the
collection
i
had
observed
the
same
practice
at
other
islands
at
the
beginning
of
a
meal
thanks
were
given
to
the
god
of
christians
for
the
bounty
of
the
sea
but
fisherman
s
luck
was
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
and
while
the
old
gods
might
be
overthrown
there
seemed
to
be
a
fairly
general
belief
that
it
would
not
do
to
trifle
with
immemorial
custom
it
was
midmorning
before
the
last
of
the
broken
meats
had
been
removed
and
the
beach
made
tidy
the
breeze
died
away
and
the
shadows
of
the
palms
moved
only
with
the
imperceptible
advance
of
the
sun
it
was
a
time
for
rest
for
quiet
meditation
and
all
of
the
older
people
were
gathered
in
the
shade
gazing
out
over
a
sea
as
tranquil
as
their
minds
as
lonely
as
their
lives
had
always
been
and
would
always
be
i
knew
that
they
would
remain
thus
throughout
the
day
talking
a
little
after
the
refreshment
of
light
slumbers
but
for
the
most
part
sitting
without
speech
or
movement
their
consciousness
crossed
by
vague
thoughts
which
would
stir
it
scarcely
more
than
the
cat
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
water
no
sudden
realization
of
the
swift
passage
of
time
would
disturb
the
peace
of
their
reverie
no
sense
of
old
loss
to
be
retrieved
would
goad
them
into
swift
and
feverish
action
a
land
crab
moved
across
a
strip
of
sunlight
and
sidled
into
his
hole
pulling
his
grotesque
little
shadow
after
him
and
the
children
restless
little
spirits
splashed
and
shouted
in
the
shallows
of
the
lagoon
maneuvering
fleets
of
empty
beef
and
salmon
tins

starry
the
only
visible
reminder
which
i
have
now
of
my
residence
on
the
island
where
the
souls
were
eaten
is
a
pocket
notebook
of
penciled
comment
with
a
dozen
pages
blank
and
fair
at
the
themselves
a
reminder
of
the
fragmentary
nature
of
that
adventure
in
solitude
of
the
blank
pages
at
the
close
of
every
chapter
of
experience
awaiting
the
final
comment
which
is
never
set
down
it
is
a
small
notebook
of
chinese
manufacture
with
a
pretty
fantasy
of
flowers
woven
through
the
word
memoranda
and
butterflies
with
wings
of
hovering
over
it
meant
to
suggest
perhaps
that
one
s
memories
however
happy
or
however
seemingly
enduring
are
as
ephemeral
as
they
and
must
soon
fade
and
die
but
i
am
not
willing
to
accept
such
a
suggestion
to
believe
that
i
can
ever
forget
even
the
most
trivial
of
the
events
which
took
place
at
rutiaro
or
at
island
by
some
peculiar
virtue
of
their
own
they
stand
out
with
the
vividness
of
portions
of
childhood
experience
which
remains
fixed
in
the
memory
when
other
more
important
happenings
have
been
long
forgotten
the
casual
reader
of
the
notebook
would
never
guess
this
from
the
comment
written
there
did
he
know
the
length
and
the
nature
of
my
residence
at
the
atoll
he
would
be
surprised
merely
that
with
so
much
leisure
for
observation
there
should
be
such
poverty
of
recorded
fact
i
myself
am
surprised
and
a
little
appalled
when
i
think
how
the
weeks
slipped
by
leaving
me
nothing
to
show
for
them
i
became
a
spendthrift
of
time
i
was
under
the
delusion
that
my
own
just
share
of
it
had
been
immeasurably
increased
that
in
some
unaccountable
way
i
had
fallen
heir
to
a
legacy
of
hours
and
days
which
could
never
be
exhausted
the
delusion
was
of
gradual
growth
like
the
habit
of
reverie
which
fastens
itself
at
last
upon
the
most
restless
of
wanderers
among
the
atolls
in
the
beginning
i
was
full
of
business
i
remember
with
what
earnestness
of
purpose
i
wrote
on
the
first
page
of
the
notebook
rutiaro
observations
on
life
and
character
in
the
low
archipelago
i
had
ambitious
plans
i
meant
to
go
back
and
forth
between
my
hermitage
and
the
village
island
notebook
in
hand
saying
tera
what
is
that
ia
parau
paumotu
how
do
you
say
this
in
paumotuan
and
when
i
had
learned
the
language
and
had
completed
my
studies
of
flora
and
fauna
i
was
to
be
the
boswell
of
the
atoll
curious
tireless
not
to
be
rebuked
by
the
wind
rustling
the
fronds
of
the
palms
nor
by
the
voice
of
the
sea
when
the
wind
was
low
saying
on
thirty
miles
of
coral
reef
but
i
was
so
it
seemed
to
now
i
fear
the
learned
monograph
is
never
to
be
written
a
faltering
purpose
is
plainly
indicated
in
the
notebook
it
becomes
apparent
in
the
first
observation
on
the
life
and
character
of
the
paumotuans
which
reads
before
the
starry
threshold
of
jove
s
court
my
mansion
is
where
those
immortal
shapes
of
bright
aerial
spirits
live
ensphered
in
regions
mild
of
calm
and
serene
air
the
president
of
the
polynesian
society
would
say
and
rightly
no
doubt
that
this
is
not
germane
to
the
subject
but
at
the
time
i
wrote
it
it
was
so
accurately
descriptive
of
the
place
where
my
house
stood
that
it
might
have
been
embodied
with
scarcely
the
exchange
of
a
word
in
an
exact
announcement
of
the
location
of
my
property
i
set
it
down
one
evening
in
early
summer
the
evening
of
my
first
day
s
residence
at
island
the
completion
of
my
house
had
been
celebrated
with
a
feast
and
toward
midnight
i
was
left
alone
watching
the
departure
of
the
last
of
the
villagers
who
were
returning
in
their
canoes
along
the
ocean
side
of
the
atoll
the
sea
was
as
calm
as
i
have
ever
seen
it
and
as
they
went
homeward
dipping
their
paddles
into
the
shining
tracks
of
the
stars
my
guests
were
singing
an
old
chant
it
was
one
of
innumerable
verses
telling
of
an
evil
earth
spirit
in
the
form
of
a
sea
bird
which
was
supposed
to
make
its
home
on
the
and
at
the
end
of
each
verse
the
voices
of
the
women
rose
in
the
refrain
which
i
could
hear
long
after
the
canoes
had
passed
from
sight
aué
nehenehe
é
alas
alas
how
beautiful
it
is
a
lament
that
a
spirit
so
vindictive
so
pitiless
should
be
so
fair
to
outward
seeming
standing
at
the
starry
threshold
listening
to
the
ghostly
refrain
i
translated
its
meaning
the
bird
to
the
island
where
perhaps
i
would
one
day
see
it
in
my
rambles
i
regretted
that
it
was
so
inaccessible
so
remote
and
hidden
from
the
world
as
though
that
were
not
more
than
half
the
reason
for
its
untarnished
beauty
it
is
a
maudlin
feeling
that
of
sadness
at
the
thought
of
loveliness
hidden
from
appraising
eyes
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
springs
not
so
much
from
an
unselfish
desire
to
share
it
as
from
a
vulgar
longing
to
say
to
one
s
gregarious
fellows
see
what
i
have
found
can
you
show
me
anything
to
equal
it
in
beauty
you
dwellers
in
cities
whatever
its
source
in
this
case
i
was
glad
that
it
passed
quickly
no
tears
stained
my
pillow
even
though
i
knew
that
rutiaro
could
never
be
the
goal
of
sunday
excursionists
but
i
was
not
quite
easy
in
mind
as
i
composed
myself
for
sleep
i
had
made
a
poor
beginning
as
a
diarist
the
first
entry
was
fanciful
and
furthermore
not
my
own
what
original
contribution
to
truth
or
beauty
could
i
make
as
a
result
of
the
day
s
events
finally
i
rose
lit
my
lamp
and
wrote
underneath
the
comus
quotation
the
paumotuans
are
very
fond
of
perfume
this
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
their
islands
being
scantly
provided
with
flowers
and
herbs
they
take
this
means
of
satisfying
their
craving
for
fragrant
odors
alas
alas
how
erroneous
it
was
that
observation
but
i
thought
when
i
made
it
that
it
was
based
upon
a
careful
enough
consideration
of
the
facts
during
the
afternoon
i
had
distributed
some
gifts
among
my
guests
chiefly
among
the
children
i
had
some
bolts
of
ribbon
and
dress
goods
some
earrings
and
bracelets
thinly
washed
in
gold
which
i
had
bought
on
credit
of
moy
ling
the
chinaman
and
i
had
been
saving
them
for
just
such
an
occasion
as
the
feast
at
island
i
also
had
a
case
of
perfume
which
moy
had
been
very
reluctant
to
part
and
toilet
waters
in
fancy
bottles
with
quaint
legends
printed
on
the
june
rose
which
the
makers
admitted
had
as
much
body
as
perfumes
wild
violet
like
a
faint
breath
from
the
forest
floor
khiva
bouquet
the
soul
of
the
exquisite
orient
etc
this
gift
was
greatly
coveted
pinga
immediately
took
charge
of
the
three
bottles
i
had
given
his
daughters
and
packed
them
carefully
in
a
together
with
a
bottle
of
bay
rum
presented
to
him
by
virtue
of
his
office
as
village
barber
rangituki
went
among
her
grandchildren
scolding
and
rating
until
she
had
made
a
similar
collection
and
in
a
short
time
all
of
the
perfume
was
in
the
hands
of
a
few
of
the
older
people
this
seemed
to
me
rather
procedure
but
it
was
not
my
place
to
interfere
with
parental
and
grandparental
authority
and
it
was
as
well
perhaps
that
the
children
should
be
restrained
otherwise
they
would
have
saturated
their
clothing
and
their
hair
and
the
atoll
would
have
smelled
to
heaven
or
very
near
it
i
thought
no
more
of
the
episode
until
the
following
sunday
when
i
went
to
church
at
the
village
a
combined
service
of
latter
day
saints
and
the
reformed
church
of
latter
day
saints
was
being
held
an
amicable
arrangement
which
would
have
scandalized
the
white
missionaries
of
those
rival
denominations
but
at
rutiaro
saints
and
reformed
saints
live
together
peaceably
enough
and
being
few
in
numbers
they
often
join
forces
for
greater
effect
in
the
the
meeting
was
held
in
the
reformed
church
a
sightly
structure
built
entirely
of
braided
fronds
of
coconut
the
earthern
floor
was
covered
with
mats
of
the
same
material
at
one
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
raised
platform
and
a
deal
table
which
served
as
a
pulpit
the
walls
lengthwise
were
built
to
prop
open
outward
giving
free
circulation
to
the
air
and
charming
views
of
the
shaded
floor
of
the
island
and
the
blue
waters
of
the
lagoon
the
church
was
full
the
men
sitting
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
according
to
island
custom
and
the
children
playing
about
on
the
floor
between
the
benches
many
of
the
older
people
too
sat
on
the
floor
with
their
backs
to
the
posts
which
supported
the
roof
interest
lagged
during
the
intervals
between
the
singing
and
although
huarai
was
preaching
in
his
usual
forceful
denunciatory
manner
i
found
my
own
thoughts
wandering
on
secular
paths
of
a
sudden
it
occurred
to
me
that
june
rose
should
be
discernible
among
the
women
of
the
congregation
if
it
had
as
much
body
as
had
been
claimed
for
it
but
i
could
not
detect
its
presence
nor
did
the
faintest
breath
reach
me
from
the
forest
floor
i
was
conscious
only
of
the
penetrating
odor
of
drying
copra
which
came
through
the
open
windows
and
the
not
unpleasant
smell
of
coconut
oil
what
had
become
of
the
perfume
i
wondered
on
sunday
if
at
all
it
should
have
been
in
evidence
for
the
women
were
in
white
dresses
and
before
coming
to
church
had
made
their
most
elaborate
toilet
of
the
week
but
huirai
was
warming
to
his
theme
and
demanded
attention
at
least
from
me
not
having
heard
him
preach
before
he
had
removed
his
coat
and
was
perspiring
and
exhorting
in
a
way
which
would
have
pleased
the
most
devout
and
gloomy
of
missionaries
he
had
a
peculiar
oratorical
manner
his
face
foretold
clearly
the
birth
of
an
idea
one
could
read
there
the
first
vague
impulse
in
the
brain
which
gave
rise
to
it
see
it
gathering
lucidity
glimmering
like
heat
lightning
on
a
summer
evening
in
his
cloudy
mind
until
it
was
given
utterance
in
a
voice
of
thunder
which
rumbled
away
to
silence
as
the
light
of
creation
died
out
of
his
eyes
then
he
would
stand
motionless
gazing
on
vacancy
profoundly
as
though
he
were
merely
the
passionless
mouthpiece
of
some
higher
power
the
abruptness
of
his
outbursts
and
his
ferocious
aspect
when
delivering
them
were
disconcerting
and
it
was
even
worse
when
at
intervals
his
eyes
met
mine
even
though
he
were
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
he
would
pause
and
his
face
would
beam
with
a
radiant
smile
in
striking
contrast
to
the
forbidding
scowl
of
the
moment
before
remembering
his
mission
he
would
then
proceed
in
his
former
manner
without
understanding
his
discourse
one
would
have
said
that
he
was
condemning
all
of
his
auditors
who
had
evidently
been
guilty
of
the
most
frightful
sins
but
this
was
not
the
case
his
sentences
were
short
and
in
the
periods
of
silence
between
them
i
had
time
to
make
a
translation
taparahi

did
he
kill
him
because
he
was
a
bad
man
a
very
bad

was

of

whom

talked
at
great
length
on
this
theme
the
members
of
the
congregation
sometimes
listening
and
sometimes
conversing
among
themselves
they
had
no
scruples
about
interrupting
the
sermon
while
huirai
was
awaiting
further
inspiration
hymns
were
started
by
the
women
and
taken
up
at
once
by
the
others

sang

went
to
the
different
churches
in
turn
because
of

had
one
of
her
granddaughters
in
her
lap
and
while
she
sang
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
child

head
in
search
of
a
tiny
parasite
which

with

and

and

huirai
alone
was
silent
gazing
with
moody
abstraction
over
the
heads
of
the
congregation
as
he
pondered
further
the
ethical
points
at
issue
in
the
cain
and
abel
story
i
had
witnessed
many
scenes
like
this
during
the
months
spent
in
cruising
among
the
atolls
on
the
to
interest
one
again
and
again
and
to
furnish
food
for
a
great
deal
of
futile
speculation
how
important
a
thing
in
the
lives
of
these
primitive
people
is
this
religion
of
ours
which
has
replaced
their
old
beliefs
and
superstitions
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
how
fundamental
for
religious
faith
is
of
slow
growth
and
it
was
only
yesterday
as
time
is
counted
that
the
ship
carrying
the
first
missionaries
who
had
ever
visited
this
southern
ocean
came
to
anchor
at
tahiti
one
of
huirai
s
remarks
called
to
mind
an
account
i
had
read
of
that
first
meeting
between
christian
missionaries
and
the
heathen
they
had
come
to
save
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
narrative
of
the
three
years
voyage
in
the
south
pacific
published
in
by
the
london
missionary
society
march
the
morning
was
pleasant
and
with
a
gentle
breeze
we
had
by
seven
o
clock
got
abreast
of
the
district
of
atahooroo
whence
we
saw
several
canoes
putting
off
and
paddling
toward
us
with
great
speed
at
the
same
time
it
fell
calm
which
being
in
their
favor
we
soon
counted
canoes
around
us
many
of
them
double
ones
containing
about
twenty
persons
each
being
so
numerous
we
endeavored
to
keep
them
from
crowding
on
board
but
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
to
prevent
it
there
were
soon
not
less
than
one
hundred
of
them
dancing
and
capering
like
frantic
persons
about
our
decks
crying
tayo
and
a
few
broken
sentences
of
english
were
often
repeated
they
had
no
weapons
of
any
kind
among
them
however
to
keep
them
in
awe
some
of
the
great
guns
were
ordered
to
be
hoisted
out
of
the
hold
whilst
they
as
free
from
apprehension
as
the
intention
of
mischief
cheerfully
assisted
to
put
them
on
their
carriages
when
the
first
ceremonies
were
over
we
began
to
view
our
new
friends
with
an
eye
of
inquiry
their
wild
disorderly
behavior
strong
smell
of
coconut
oil
together
with
the
tricks
of
the
lessened
the
favorable
opinion
we
had
formed
of
them
neither
could
we
see
aught
of
that
elegance
and
beauty
in
their
women
for
which
they
have
been
so
greatly
celebrated
this
at
first
seemed
to
depreciate
them
in
the
estimation
of
our
brethren
but
the
cheerfulness
good
nature
and
generosity
of
these
kind
people
soon
removed
the
momentary
prejudices
they
continued
to
go
about
the
decks
till
the
transports
of
their
joy
gradually
subsided
when
many
of
them
left
us
of
their
own
accord
those
who
remained
in
number
about
forty
being
brought
to
order
the
brethren
proposed
having
divine
service
on
the
quarterdeck
cover
officiated
he
perhaps
was
the
first
that
ever
mentioned
with
reverence
the
saviour
s
name
to
these
poor
heathens
such
hymns
were
selected
as
had
the
most
harmonious
o
er
the
gloomy
hills
of
darkness
then
blow
ye
the
trumpet
blow
and
at
the
conclusion
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
the
whole
service
lasted
about
an
hour
and
a
quarter
how
clear
a
picture
one
has
of
the
scene
described
by
men
whose
purity
of
faith
whose
sincerity
of
belief
were
beyond
question
but
one
smiles
a
little
sadly
at
the
thought
of
their
austerity
their
total
lack
of
that
other
divine
sense
of
humor
tayo
friend
friend
the
tahitians
cried
and
the
missionaries
to
requite
them
for
their
kindly
welcome
organized
a
prayer
meeting
an
hour
and
a
quarter
in
length
and
sang
o
er
the
gloomy
hills
of
darkness
it
was
a
prophecy
that
song
the
tahitians
and
others
of
the
polynesian
family
have
gone
far
on
that
road
since
of
course
one
doesn
t
blame
the
missionaries
for
this
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chief
benefit
resulting
from
the
christianizing
process
is
that
it
has
offset
some
of
the
evils
resulting
from
the
rest
of
the
civilizing
process
this
was
not
the
opinion
of
tino
supercargo
of
the
however
i
remember
a
conversation
which
i
had
with
him
on
the
subject
when
rutiaro
itself
lay
within
view
but
still
far
distant
for
the
sake
of
argument
i
had
made
some
willfully
disparaging
remark
about
traders
and
tino
had
taken
exception
to
it
you
re
wrong
he
said
you
know
as
well
as
i
maybe
you
don
these
people
used
to
be
cannibals
and
not
so
many
years
ago
at
that
i
don
t
suppose
you
would
call
it
a
genteel
practice
well
what
stopped
it
i
ll
tell
you
what
stopped
beef
that
was
a
new
angle
of
vision
to
me
i
said
nothing
but
i
thought
i
could
detect
a
hint
of
a
smile
in
his
eyes
as
he
waited
for
the
statement
to
sink
in
i
have
had
some
fun
in
my
time
he
went
on
arguing
this
out
with
the
missionaries
i
say
tinned
beef
and
they
say
the
four
gospels
can
t
be
proved
either
way
of
course
but
suppose
right
now
every
trading
schooner
in
the
archipelago
was
to
lay
a
course
for
papeete
suppose
not
one
of
them
was
to
go
back
to
the
atolls
for
the
next
years
leave
the
people
to
themselves
as
you
say
and
let
them
have
their
missionaries
with
the
golden
rule
in
one
hand
and
the
ten
commandments
in
the
other
what
chance
would
they
have
of
dying
a
natural
death
the
missionaries
i
mean
about
as
much
chance
as
i
have
of
getting
old
maroaki
at
taka
raro
to
pay
me
the
eight
hundred
francs
he
owes
me
what
makes
me
laugh
inside
is
that
the
missionaries
are
so
serious
about
the
influence
they
have
had
on
the
natives
i
could
tell
them
some
what
would
be
the
use
they
wouldn
t
believe
me
just
before
we
left
papeete
this
time
i
was
talking
to
one
of
the
protestants
he
told
me
that
his
church
had
two
thousand
converts
in
french
oceania
while
the
catholics
had
only
around
six
hundred
i
believe
it
was
i
said
that
i
knew
how
he
could
get
that
extra
six
hundred
into
his
own
fold
and
probably
a
good
many
more
if
he
wanted
to
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
charter
my
schooner
load
her
with
tahiti
mangoes
oranges
breadfruit
he
needn
t
take
a
single
gallon
of
rum
unless
he
wanted
to
then
we
would
make
a
tour
of
the
islands
holding
church
festivals
with
refreshments
at
every
one
and
at
the
end
of
the
cruise
i
would
guarantee
that
there
wouldn
t
be
a
catholic
left
in
all
the
paumotus
he
didn
t
take
to
the
plan
at
all
and
of
course
it
did
have
one
weak
the
brothers
tried
the
same
game
they
would
have
just
the
same
success
and
nobody
could
tell
from
one
week
to
the
next
which
were
protestants
and
which
were
catholics
that
s
about
what
happened
at
taka
raro
the
last
time
i
was
down
there
the
population
is
supposed
to
be
divided
about
half
and
half
between
the
latter
day
saints
and
the
catholics
there
are
no
missionaries
living
on
the
island
the
head
churches
in
papeete
send
their
men
around
when
they
can
to
see
how
things
are
going
with
their
flocks
that
is
usually
about
once
a
year
for
each
of
them
boats
don
t
often
put
in
at
taka
raro
i
ve
been
there
only
four
times
in
ten
years
myself
and
the
last
time
i
brought
down
a
young
fellow
from
the
protestant
crowd
he
had
been
with
me
the
whole
cruise
holding
services
at
the
islands
where
i
had
put
in
for
copra
i
hadn
t
gone
to
any
of
them
but
at
taka
raro
i
felt
the
need
of
some
religion
i
had
spent
the
whole
day
chasing
that
maroaki
i
spoke
about
the
old
rascal
has
owed
me
that
eight
hundred
francs
since
nineteen
ten
he
is
an
elder
in
his
church
too
the
minute
he
makes
out
my
schooner
standing
in
toward
the
pass
off
he
goes
on
important
business
to
the
far
end
of
the
lagoon
i
went
after
him
that
day
with
my
usual
luck
he
wasn
t
to
be
found
and
i
came
back
to
the
village
feeling
a
bit
ruffled
up
it
was
just
time
for
the
meeting
and
i
decided
that
i
might
as
well
go
as
to
loaf
around
finding
that
old
hypocrite
while
my
copra
was
being
loaded
the
church
was
packed
when
i
went
in
there
wasn
t
a
catholic
in
the
village
that
evening
all
of
those
who
had
been
catholics
were
taking
part
in
the
and
singing
the
protestant
songs
as
well
as
the
latter
day
saints
no
one
seemed
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
sermon
though
the
young
missionary
didn
t
understand
the
language
very
well
and
the
preaching
was
hard
for
him
but
he
seemed
to
feel
pretty
good
about
the
meeting
and
when
we
left
the
next
day
he
went
down
to
the
cabin
to
write
a
report
of
the
progress
his
church
had
made
at
taka
raro
he
must
have
had
a
lot
to
say
for
he
was
at
it
all
the
morning
he
didn
t
know
that
we
passed
the
ata
just
after
we
got
out
of
the
pass
that
made
me
feel
good
for
louis
germaine
her
skipper
has
been
a
rival
of
mine
for
years
and
i
had
every
kilo
of
dry
copra
there
was
on
the
island
i
got
the
megaphone
and
was
about
to
yell
good
luck
to
you
louis
when
i
saw
that
he
had
a
missionary
aboard
priest
with
a
beard
and
a
black
cloak
so
i
only
waved
my
hand
and
louis
shook
his
fist
and
shouted
something
i
couldn
t
make
out
i
was
going
to
the
westward
stood
close
inshore
and
passed
the
village
from
the
outside
an
hour
later
the
priest
hadn
t
lost
any
time
getting
his
congregation
together
since
there
was
no
copra
to
be
bought
i
suppose
louis
told
him
he
had
to
get
a
move
on
there
had
been
another
religious
landslide
i
was
sure
of
that
from
the
singing
which
i
heard
clear
enough
the
wind
being
offshore
great
singers
these
paumotuans
and
it
doesn
t
make
very
much
difference
to
them
whether
the
song
is
happy
day
or
jerusalem
the
of
course
i
didn
t
say
anything
to
my
missionary
as
the
old
saying
is
what
you
don
t
know
won
t
hurt
this
conversation
with
tino
was
running
through
my
mind
as
i
strolled
down
the
village
island
after
the
service
tino
i
decided
was
prejudiced
his
was
the
typical
trader
s
point
of
view
i
had
heard
many
other
incidents
which
bore
him
out
in
his
findings
but
they
came
usually
from
men
interested
in
exploiting
the
islands
commercially
huirai
s
exposition
of
the
old
biblical
that
merely
the
result
of
a
prolonged
crusade
remembering
the
kind
of
sacrifice
which
was
discussed
very
likely
on
this
very
island
in
the
days
of
pure
heathendom
such
a
conclusion
seemed
fantastical
no
one
must
be
fair
to
the
missionaries
perhaps
they
were
at
times
oversanguine
about
the
results
of
their
were
all
human
beings
in
whatever
line
of
endeavor
but
their
accomplishment
had
been
undeniably
great
here
were
people
living
orderly
quiet
lives
they
didn
t
drink
although
in
the
early
days
of
their
contact
with
quite
recently
in
had
been
terrible
orgies
of
intoxication
to
overcome
that
was
in
itself
a
worthwhile
accomplishment
on
the
part
of
the
church
only
a
few
weeks
before
i
had
met
monsieur
ferlys
the
administrator
of
the
paumotus
at
taenga
the
reign
of
alcohol
is
over
he
had
said
to
the
islanders
words
coming
from
the
lips
of
a
frenchman
there
was
to
be
no
more
rum
nor
gin
nor
wine
for
any
of
the
paumotuans
henceforth
any
trader
found
selling
it
or
any
native
drinking
it
was
to
be
severely
punished
i
continued
my
walk
to
the
far
end
of
the
island
and
selecting
a
shady
spot
sat
down
to
rest
the
pressure
of
a
notebook
in
my
hip
pocket
interrupted
my
examination
of
the
problem
the
missionary
versus
the
trader
as
a
civilizing
influence
i
was
reminded
that
i
had
made
no
recent
observations
on
the
life
and
character
of
the
paumotuans
and
the
recollection
was
annoying
was
i
never
to
be
able
to
pursue
in
indolence
my
unprofitable
musings
why
this
persistent
feeling
that
i
must
set
them
down
in
black
and
white
why
sully
the
fair
pages
of
my
notebook
words
words
the
world
was
buried
beneath
their
visible
manifestations
and
still
the
interminable
clacking
of
innumerable
typewriters
the
roar
of
glutted
presses
in
the
mind
s
eye
i
saw
magnificent
forests
being
destroyed
to
feed
this
depraved
appetite
for
words
which
were
piled
mountain
high
in
libraries
which
encumbered
all
the
attics
in
christendom
words
blowing
about
the
streets
and
littering
the
parks
on
sundays
filling
the
ash
carts
on
mondays
no
i
thought
i
will
no
longer
be
guilty
of
adding
to
the
sum
of
words
i
ll
not
write
my
learned
monograph
but
that
inner
voice
which
itself
is
a
creature
born
of
many
artificial
thing
however
insistent
its
out
loud
and
clear
you
idler
you
waster
of
your
inheritance
of
energy
you
throwback
to
but
why
i
replied
tell
me
that
why
sir
because
it
is
your
vocation
and
have
you
no
convictions
your
grandfather
had
them
and
your
and
those
missionaries
of
the
you
have
been
thinking
about
ah
the
decay
of
convictions
in
this
age
the
lack
of
that
old
sublime
belief
in
now
then
i
have
come
down
to
you
through
a
long
line
of
ancestors
and
i
don
t
mean
to
die
through
lack
of
exercise
you
may
not
believe
in
me
but
you
ve
got
to
obey
me
write
i
know
that
i
should
have
no
peace
until
i
did
so
i
drew
forth
my
notebook
and
in
line
with
my
thoughts
of
a
moment
before
wrote
underneath
the
last
observation
on
perfume
the
sale
and
consumption
of
alcoholic
beverages
among
these
islands
is
now
prohibited
by
law
it
is
strange
to
find
such
legislation
in
territory
under
french
administration
is
the
prohibition
movement
to
become
then
is
the
reign
of
alcohol
doomed
in
all
lands
exhausted
by
the
mental
effort
but
somewhat
easier
in
conscience
i
replaced
the
notebook
in
my
pocket
it
was
pleasant
then
to
let
the
mind
lie
fallow
or
to
occupy
it
with
the
reception
of
mere
visual
impressions
at
length
although
i
didn
t
sleep
i
was
scarcely
more
animate
then
the
fluted
shell
lying
close
by
on
the
beach
or
the
bushes
which
formed
a
green
inclosure
around
my
resting
place
something
whirled
through
the
air
over
my
head
and
fell
with
a
light
splash
in
the
water
before
me
i
sat
gazing
at
it
without
curiosity
hardly
moved
so
slowly
does
one
come
out
of
the
depths
of
dreamless
reverie
little
waves
pushed
the
object
gently
shoreward
until
it
lay
rolling
back
and
forth
in
a
few
inches
of
clear
water
what
i
shouted
i
didn
t
actually
didn
t
open
my
lips
but
the
shock
of
astonishment
seemed
loud
as
a
blare
of
trumpets
or
a
clash
of
cymbals
before
me
lay
a
prettily
fashioned
bottle
half
filled
with
sea
water
and
the
label
on
it
read
khiva
bouquet
the
soul
of
the
exquisite
orient
impossible
i
thought
i
am
three
miles
from
the
village
and
no
one
lives
at
this
end
of
the
island
then
i
heard
voices
or
better
one
voice
which
i
recognized
as
that
of
rangituki
she
was
talking
in
a
low
monotone
her
most
effective
manner
when
reciting
one
of
her
interminable
stories
of
former
days
cautiously
i
pushed
aside
the
bushes
and
looked
through
rangituki
was
sitting
about
twenty
yards
away
in
the
midst
of
a
company
of
five
pinga
was
one
of
them
and
tevai
fathers
of
families
and
both
much
concerned
a
few
days
earlier
lest
their
children
should
waste
the
perfume
i
had
given
them
pinga
took
a
pull
at
a
bottle
which
i
identified
as
belonging
to
wild
violet
he
made
a
wry
face
as
he
did
it
but
he
took
another
and
then
another
before
he
set
it
down
the
wind
was
toward
me
and
as
the
corks
more
accurately
as
stoppers
were
was
forced
to
admit
that
june
rose
had
body
impalpable
perhaps
but
authentic
i
passed
the
furtive
revelers
unnoticed
by
going
along
the
lagoon
beach
keeping
under
the
screen
of
kopapa
bushes
should
i
tell
puarei
the
chief
of
this
evasion
of
the
law
i
decided
that
i
would
not
for
he
was
a
stern
man
and
would
punish
the
culprits
severely
after
all
on
an
island
where
there
were
so
few
distractions
what
was
a
little
perfume
among
friends
all
of
which
proves
plainly
enough
it
seems
to
me
the
folly
of
keeping
a
notebook
at
any
rate
the
folly
of
jumping
hastily
to
conclusions
or
perhaps
more
important
than
this
it
gives
further
light
on
the
vexed
question
does
prohibition
prohibit
i
find
no
other
observations
on
paumotuan
life
and
character
under
this
date
unless
the
word
scribbled
on
the
margin
of
a
leaf
may
be
regarded
as
a
discouraged
hint
at
one
a
suggestion
for
a
commentary
on
a
curious
polynesian
relationship
only
should
have
had
time
to
gather
all
of
the
available
data
concerning
it
this
relationship
has
to
do
with
the
transfer
of
a
child
or
children
from
the
original
blood
parents
to
another
set
known
as
my
interest
in
the
practice
dates
from
the
moment
when
i
made
my
first
notebook
reference
to
it
and
it
was
aroused
in
a
very
casual
leisurely
fashion
for
this
reason
it
will
be
best
i
think
to
tell
the
story
of
it
in
a
leisurely
way
returning
to
the
village
from
the
scene
of
the
perfume
orgy
i
found
the
church
still
occupied
although
the
service
was
long
over
the
benches
had
been
stacked
in
one
corner
the
mats
shaken
out
and
spread
again
on
the
floor
where
fifteen
or
twenty
people
were
reclining
at
ease
or
sitting
native
of
them
talking
some
sleeping
some
engaged
in
light
tasks
such
as
hat
weaving
and
the
fashioning
of
fish
hooks
others
in
the
yet
more
congenial
task
of
doing
nothing
at
all
it
was
the
practice
on
sunday
for
the
village
to
gather
at
the
reformed
church
which
they
felt
at
liberty
to
use
for
secular
as
well
as
for
sacred
purposes
for
it
was
a
structure
with
walls
and
roof
of
thatch
like
those
of
their
own
houses
the
two
other
churches
were
never
so
used
they
were
frame
buildings
in
the
european
or
american
style
of
church
architecture
with
formal
furnishings
and
windows
of
colored
glass
to
have
done
any
sort
of
work
in
either
of
them
would
have
been
regarded
as
a
serious
offense
certain
to
be
followed
by
unmistakable
evidence
of
divine
displeasure
as
tuina
once
told
me
sores
illness
even
death
might
result
as
a
punishment
for
such
desecration
i
was
thinking
of
this
and
other
primitive
reactions
to
ecclesiastical
furniture
and
my
hand
was
faltering
toward
my
notebook
pocket
when
huirai
s
little
daughter
manava
entered
the
church
carrying
a
white
cloth
which
she
spread
on
the
pulpit
table
she
returned
a
moment
later
with
a
tin
of
sardines
some
boiled
rice
on
a
leaf
and
a
bowl
of
tea
i
was
huirai
s
guest
for
the
day
and
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
some
evidence
that
food
was
on
the
way
but
i
had
not
expected
that
it
would
be
served
in
the
church
i
had
not
eaten
a
church
dinner
since
boyhood
and
strangely
enough
the
memory
of
some
of
those
early
feasts
came
back
to
me
while
manava
was
setting
the
table
as
one
scene
is
superimposed
upon
another
on
a
screen
i
saw
an
american
village
of
twenty
years
village
of
board
sidewalks
and
quiet
shaded
streets
bright
with
dandelions
taking
ghostly
form
and
transparency
among
the
palms
of
rutiaro
two
small
boys
walked
briskly
along
ringing
hand
bells
and
shouting
dinner
at
the
church
the
fife
two
tenor
drums
and
one
outside
the
church
where
the
crowd
was
gathering
and
horses
attached
to
buggies
and
spring
wagons
were
pawing
the
earth
around
the
hitching
posts
then
macgregor
appeared
in
the
doorway
her
kindly
face
beaming
the
warmest
of
welcomes
come
on
in
and
set
down
folks
everything
s
all
ready
members
of
the
ladies
relief
of
large
families
used
to
catering
for
large
back
and
forth
with
platters
of
roast
turkey
and
chicken
roast
beef
mashed
potatoes
of
marvelous
smoothness
and
everything
in
the
way
of
food
which
that
hospitable
country
provides
i
heard
the
pleasant
talk
of
homely
things
smelled
the
appetizing
odors
saw
plates
replenished
again
and
again
throughout
the
length
of
the
tables
gravy
boats
sailed
from
cover
to
i
spared
myself
further
contemplation
of
the
scene
further
shadowy
participation
in
a
feast
which
cost
the
affluent
but
a
quarter
and
a
bell
ringer
nothing
at
all
the
vision
faded
but
before
it
was
quite
gone
i
heard
a
voice
saying
land
sakes
you
boys
ain
t
eating
a
thing
have
some
more
of
these
dumplings
what
s
the
matter
with
your
appetities
ain
t
you
feelin
well
it
seemed
a
thousand
years
away
that
voice
and
no
doubt
it
was
and
is
even
farther
than
that
church
dinners
at
rutiaro
were
not
such
sumptuous
affairs
they
were
not
in
fact
an
integral
part
of
the
community
life
in
so
far
as
i
know
this
was
the
only
one
ever
held
there
and
was
the
result
of
huirai
s
peculiar
notions
of
the
hospitality
due
a
white
man
i
told
him
that
i
was
not
accustomed
to
dining
in
churches
at
home
even
on
sunday
and
furthermore
that
i
liked
companionship
at
table
but
he
was
not
convinced
and
he
refused
to
join
me
he
and
his
family
had
already
eaten
he
said
so
i
sat
on
a
box
at
the
pulpit
table
partaking
of
a
solitary
meal
and
got
through
with
it
as
quickly
as
possible
i
smiled
inwardly
at
the
thought
of
the
inheritance
of
prestige
granted
me
without
question
at
rutiaro
merely
because
i
was
the
sole
representative
there
of
a
superior
race
no
white
wasters
had
preceded
me
at
the
atoll
this
was
fortunate
in
a
way
for
it
gave
me
something
to
live
up
ideal
rutiaroan
conception
of
the
man
huirai
was
partly
responsible
for
the
fact
that
it
was
ideal
his
tales
of
san
to
the
paumotuan
means
been
steadily
growing
in
splendor
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
whatever
he
may
have
seen
there
of
misery
or
incompetence
or
ugliness
all
americans
were
divinities
of
a
sort
their
energy
was
superhuman
their
accomplishment
as
exemplified
in
ships
trains
buildings
automobiles
all
belief
unless
one
had
actually
seen
those
things
and
the
meanest
of
them
lived
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
far
surpassing
that
of
the
governor
of
the
paumotus
at
fakavava
yes
i
had
something
to
live
up
to
at
rutiaro
the
necessity
was
flattering
to
be
sure
but
it
cost
some
effort
and
inconvenience
to
meet
it
i
didn
t
dare
look
as
slack
as
i
often
felt
both
mentally
and
physically
i
could
not
even
sit
on
the
floor
or
stretch
out
at
my
ease
when
in
a
native
house
and
i
was
compelled
when
eating
to
resume
the
use
of
my
fork
and
the
small
tin
spoon
although
it
was
much
simpler
and
easier
to
eat
with
my
fingers
as
the
rest
of
them
did
having
finished
my
meal
i
took
what
comfort
prestige
permitted
by
placing
my
box
by
the
wall
and
leaning
back
against
a
post
takiero
a
woman
of
barbaric
beauty
was
sitting
near
by
playing
conquer
the
north
on
my
ocharina
i
taught
her
the
air
in
an
unguarded
moment
and
had
been
regretting
it
ever
since
hunga
her
husband
lay
at
her
side
his
strong
fine
limbs
relaxed
in
sleep
i
would
have
given
all
my
gratuitous
prestige
as
a
to
have
exchanged
legs
or
shoulders
or
girth
of
chest
with
him
it
was
at
about
this
time
as
i
remember
it
that
my
thoughts
turned
to
the
subject
of
was
present
the
three
months
old
baby
it
belonged
as
i
knew
to
takiero
who
appeared
to
be
quite
capable
of
nourishing
it
herself
why
had
she
given
it
to
and
why
had
hunga
the
father
of
the
child
consented
to
this
seemingly
unnatural
gift
the
transfer
of
parenthood
had
been
made
a
month
earlier
since
which
time
takiero
and
her
husband
had
shown
only
a
slight
proprietary
interest
in
their
offspring
takiero
sometimes
dandled
it
on
her
knee
as
any
woman
might
the
child
of
some
one
else
but
no
one
would
have
guessed
that
she
was
the
mother
of
it
fed
clothed
and
bathed
it
and
her
husband
was
as
fond
of
it
as
she
herself
they
kept
the
child
at
their
house
and
between
them
made
as
much
fuss
over
it
as
though
it
were
their
own
flesh
and
blood
what
could
have
been
the
origin
of
this
strange
practice
of
parenthood
by
proxy
it
was
a
common
one
throughout
eastern
polynesia
i
had
seen
a
good
many
instances
of
it
in
the
cook
islands
the
marquesas
and
the
society
group
here
was
a
subject
worthy
of
an
important
chapter
in
the
life
and
character
monograph
and
i
decided
that
i
might
as
well
begin
my
researches
at
once
takiero
reluctantly
left
off
her
playing
and
placed
herself
in
a
receptive
mood
why
i
asked
had
she
given
her
child
to
her
reply
was
because
had
asked
for
it
but
see
here
takiero
i
said
i
should
think
that
you
and
hunga
would
want
to
keep
your
own
baby
it
is
none
of
my
business
of
course
i
ask
you
only
because
i
would
like
to
get
some
information
on
this
custom
can
t
you
feed
it
yourself
is
that
the
reason
you
gave
it
away
i
blundered
atrociously
in
asking
that
question
without
meaning
to
i
touched
her
pride
as
a
woman
as
a
mother
takiero
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
she
tore
open
her
dress
and
gave
me
absolute
that
i
wanted
her
ability
to
nurse
her
own
or
any
other
child
following
this
she
went
over
to
where
was
sitting
snatched
the
baby
from
her
arms
and
almost
smothered
it
against
her
body
she
fondled
it
kissed
it
covered
it
with
her
magnificent
hair
i
had
never
before
seen
such
a
display
of
savage
and
tender
maternal
passion
by
that
time
had
recovered
from
her
astonishment
and
came
to
the
defense
of
her
own
her
month
of
motherhood
gave
her
claims
to
the
child
apparently
and
she
tried
to
enforce
them
physically
takiero
stood
her
ground
her
black
eyes
flaming
and
holding
the
baby
in
one
arm
pushed
away
with
the
other
i
expected
to
see
hair
flying
but
luckily
both
women
found
their
tongues
at
the
same
moment
they
were
were
in
superb
cats
spitting
at
each
other
the
torrent
of
words
did
not
flow
smoothly
it
came
in
hot
short
bursts
like
salvos
of
fire
and
curiously
enough
it
was
almost
pure
paumotuan
not
the
hybrid
commonly
used
in
their
temperate
speech
it
bristled
with
snarling
ng
s
with
flintlike
k
s
from
which
fire
could
be
struck
in
passionate
argument
other
women
took
sides
in
the
quarrel
had
i
poked
an
inquisitive
pencil
into
a
wasps
nest
the
effect
could
hardly
have
been
more
disconcerting
hunga
was
awakened
by
the
angry
voices
and
looked
on
with
sleepy
perplexity
grinned
reassuringly
as
much
as
to
say
don
t
be
upset
you
know
what
women
are
finally
puarei
the
chief
who
had
been
an
impassive
spectator
bellowed
out
a
command
for
silence
the
tumult
subsided
at
once
and
the
fury
of
the
women
with
it
five
minutes
later
everything
was
as
it
had
been
before
hunga
was
sleeping
and
polishing
a
fish
hook
had
the
baby
and
takiero
the
ocharina
neither
of
them
showed
the
least
resentment
either
toward
me
or
toward
each
other
in
intensity
and
briefness
the
gust
of
passion
which
swept
through
the
little
church
was
precisely
like
the
squalls
of
wind
and
rain
which
darken
the
seas
of
the
low
archipelago
in
the
midst
of
the
hurricane
season
which
burst
almost
from
a
clear
sky
and
then
as
suddenly
melt
into
pure
sunlight
again
when
i
left
the
village
to
return
to
island
takiero
was
still
playing
the
old
border
ballad
on
my
ocharina
it
had
once
been
my
favorite
air
for
that
instrument
i
first
heard
it
in
northern
france
on
a
blustering
winter
evening
when
a
brigade
of
english
regiments
was
marching
under
heavy
shell
fire
into
one
of
the
greatest
battles
of
the
war
to
the
music
of
pipes
and
drums
humming
the
air
now
although
i
still
feel
a
tightening
of
the
nerves
a
quickening
of
the
pulses
it
is
not
because
of
the
old
set
of
associations
they
have
been
buried
forever
beneath
a
newer
set
the
village
at
rutiaro
comes
into
view
and
i
see
takiero
clutching
a
baby
against
her
naked
breast
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
turbulent
women
should
there
be
some
other
polynesian
scholar
who
wishes
to
pursue
farther
an
inquiry
into
a
curious
practice
of
child
adoption
i
would
advise
extreme
caution
at
an
atoll
far
on
the
southeasterly
fringe
of
the
low
archipelago
the
place
may
easily
be
identified
for
he
will
find
there
a
young
woman
of
barbaric
beauty
who
will
be
playing
conquer
the
north
on
an
ocharina
illustration
chapter
ix
tailpiece
for
an
authentic
test
of
one
s
capacity
for
better
perhaps
for
convincing
proof
of
the
lack
of
conditions
are
essential
complete
goes
without
saying
of
course
and
the
assurance
that
such
isolation
will
not
be
broken
into
at
island
i
expected
to
find
both
of
these
conditions
fulfilled
my
house
was
four
miles
from
the
settlement
but
in
reality
i
had
no
more
seclusion
there
than
a
hermit
whose
retreat
is
within
easy
walking
distance
of
a
summer
hotel
visitors
came
in
canoes
in
cutters
and
as
the
pass
and
the
reef
on
either
side
of
it
were
a
favorite
fishing
ground
many
of
them
came
prepared
to
spend
the
day
or
the
night
or
both
it
is
as
well
perhaps
that
the
event
fell
out
as
it
did
if
life
is
to
keep
its
fine
zest
many
experiences
must
be
perpetually
unrealized
and
we
perpetually
following
our
alluring
phantoms
until
we
tumble
headlong
out
of
existence
not
having
been
put
to
the
proof
i
may
still
persuade
myself
that
i
am
a
lover
of
solitude
gifted
for
the
enjoyment
of
it
beyond
other
men
meanwhile
at
island
i
had
a
further
experience
with
moy
ling
the
chinese
storekeeper
which
convinced
me
of
very
definite
limitations
in
another
direction
some
time
after
i
had
taken
up
residence
there
the
village
came
in
a
body
to
the
adjacent
island
on
the
other
side
of
the
pass
during
the
year
they
moved
in
this
way
from
one
piece
of
land
to
another
collecting
the
ripe
coconuts
and
making
their
copra
on
the
spot
the
land
was
not
owned
in
common
but
they
worked
it
in
common
and
as
house
building
was
a
simple
matter
instead
of
going
back
and
forth
from
the
village
they
erected
temporary
shelters
and
remained
at
each
island
in
turn
until
the
work
there
was
finished
they
were
not
unremitting
toilers
after
an
hour
or
two
of
copra
making
in
the
cool
of
the
early
morning
they
were
content
to
call
it
a
day
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
at
more
congenial
fishing
visiting
back
and
forth
talking
forever
of
the
arrival
of
the
last
trading
schooner
and
the
probable
date
of
arrival
of
the
next
one
during
all
of
this
time
i
kept
open
house
and
since
i
was
indebted
to
nearly
all
of
my
friendly
visitors
for
past
hospitalities
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
returns
unfortunately
i
had
nothing
to
make
returns
with
except
such
supplies
of
provisions
and
trade
goods
as
i
was
able
to
purchase
on
credit
of
moy
ling
fish
were
abundant
in
the
lagoon
and
a
few
minutes
of
fine
sport
each
day
more
than
supplied
my
wants
but
i
knew
that
fish
was
not
acceptable
to
palates
long
accustomed
to
little
else
furthermore
having
accepted
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
at
rutiaro
the
role
of
the
generous
affluent
i
had
to
carry
it
through
as
previously
related
although
i
had
been
left
at
rutiaro
unexpectedly
the
inhabitants
took
it
for
granted
that
i
had
plenty
of
money
the
possession
of
wealth
in
the
form
of
banknotes
is
regarded
there
as
one
of
the
attributes
of
a
white
man
as
necessary
to
his
comfort
and
convenience
and
as
much
a
part
of
him
as
arms
and
legs
pride
prevented
my
disillusioning
them
at
first
when
i
was
in
desperate
need
of
a
new
wardrobe
but
it
got
me
into
a
devil
of
a
hole
with
moy
and
i
dug
myself
in
more
deeply
every
day
having
traded
upon
the
native
tradition
of
the
mysterious
affluence
of
all
white
men
by
opening
up
a
credit
account
with
the
chinaman
i
had
to
sustain
his
confidence
in
my
ability
to
cancel
it
at
once
if
i
choose
and
feeling
inwardly
abject
it
was
all
the
more
necessary
to
maintain
a
reassuring
front
in
the
face
of
his
growing
anxiety
it
was
growing
i
could
see
that
he
never
actually
dunned
me
but
i
escaped
the
humiliating
experience
only
by
making
additional
purchases
on
so
vast
a
scale
according
to
island
standards
that
even
moy
seemed
to
be
awed
for
brief
periods
into
a
stupefied
acceptance
of
the
mysteriously
affluent
myth
i
myself
was
awed
when
i
thought
of
the
size
of
my
bill
trade
goods
carried
across
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
are
more
than
usually
expensive
a
tin
of
bully
beef
cost
nine
francs
and
other
things
were
proportionally
dear
the
worst
of
it
was
that
moy
s
stock
of
supplies
was
much
larger
than
i
had
at
first
supposed
he
had
a
warehouse
adjoining
his
store
which
was
full
of
them
and
so
with
guests
making
constant
demands
upon
my
hospitality
i
was
forced
to
buy
with
the
greater
abandon
as
his
confidence
waned
but
i
returned
from
these
encounters
with
a
feeling
regretting
that
i
had
ever
accepted
guile
as
an
ally
and
longing
for
relief
from
a
state
of
affairs
which
i
knew
could
not
continue
indefinitely
relief
came
in
histrionic
fashion
providence
saved
me
when
i
thought
pride
was
riding
me
to
a
starry
fall
one
evening
i
paddled
across
to
the
other
island
for
further
supplies
huirai
and
his
family
had
been
staying
with
me
for
several
days
fishing
was
better
on
my
side
of
the
lagoon
pass
he
said
but
i
think
his
real
purpose
in
coming
had
been
to
eat
my
or
rather
moy
ling
s
tinned
beef
at
any
rate
when
they
returned
i
had
nothing
left
it
was
still
fairly
early
but
no
one
was
abroad
in
the
village
street
there
was
a
light
in
moy
s
shop
however
and
looking
through
the
open
window
i
saw
him
sitting
at
a
table
with
his
adding
machine
before
him
he
was
counting
aloud
in
chinese
his
long
slim
fingers
playing
skilfully
over
the
wooden
beads
which
slid
back
and
forth
on
the
framework
with
a
soft
clicking
sound
and
as
he
bent
over
columns
of
figures
the
lamp
light
filled
the
hollows
of
his
cheeks
and
temples
with
pits
of
shadow
in
repose
his
face
was
as
expressionless
as
that
of
a
corpse
i
felt
my
courage
going
as
i
looked
at
it
what
chance
had
i
of
carrying
through
successfully
this
game
of
beggarman
s
bluff
how
long
could
i
hope
to
maintain
the
fiction
of
affluence
before
a
man
wise
with
the
inherited
experience
of
centuries
of
shopkeeping
ancestors
i
had
a
moment
of
panic
and
before
i
realized
what
i
was
doing
i
had
entered
the
shop
and
had
asked
for
my
bill
moy
into
his
back
room
and
returned
with
a
large
packet
of
old
newspapers
he
was
a
frugal
soul
and
kept
his
accounts
as
he
ordered
his
an
eye
to
avoiding
unnecessary
expense
the
journals
were
painted
over
with
chinese
items
of
my
various
purchases
he
arranged
the
lists
in
order
sat
down
to
his
counting
machine
again
and
presently
gave
me
the
grand
total
the
amount
was
something
over
four
thousand
francs
thank
heaven
for
righteous
anger
thank
heaven
for
anger
which
is
only
moderately
righteous
i
knew
that
i
had
bought
lavishly
but
i
had
kept
a
rough
estimate
of
the
amount
of
my
purchases
and
i
also
knew
that
moy
had
added
at
least
per
cent
to
his
legitimate
profit
he
had
reasoned
no
doubt
that
a
man
who
bought
on
mere
whim
without
asking
the
price
of
anything
would
settle
his
obligation
as
thoughtlessly
as
he
had
incurred
it
and
i
would
of
course
this
was
necessary
if
i
were
to
live
up
to
native
tradition
in
the
grand
style
but
when
i
saw
how
costly
the
game
had
become
and
how
thoroughly
moy
had
entered
into
the
spirit
of
it
too
i
felt
indignant
and
instead
of
confessing
my
predicament
as
i
meant
to
do
i
ordered
another
case
of
tinned
beef
and
a
bag
of
rice
and
left
the
shop
without
further
talk
this
righteous
wrath
was
all
very
well
but
now
that
i
had
asked
for
my
bill
i
would
have
to
settle
it
how
was
this
to
be
done
if
only
i
had
my
sea
chest
which
tino
supercargo
of
the
had
carried
away
with
him
when
he
left
me
at
rutiaro
my
pocketbook
was
in
it
containing
all
of
my
money
more
than
enough
to
cancel
the
debt
with
moy
i
had
rather
an
anxious
time
during
the
next
few
days
i
remember
entertaining
as
usual
but
in
a
way
sleeping
badly
and
between
times
walking
up
and
down
island
trying
to
subdue
my
pride
to
the
point
of
confession
then
one
afternoon
when
i
was
sitting
on
the
ocean
beach
watching
the
surf
piling
up
on
the
barrier
reef
i
became
aware
of
a
vessel
on
the
horizon
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
it
was
like
a
far
halloo
from
a
world
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
existed
all
through
the
afternoon
she
beat
steadily
to
windward
until
at
dusk
she
was
about
two
miles
distant
and
i
saw
that
she
was
one
of
the
small
schooners
without
auxiliary
power
which
are
used
by
papeete
trading
companies
for
collecting
copra
at
the
less
profitable
atolls
all
the
village
came
over
to
island
for
the
anchorage
at
this
end
of
the
atoll
lay
just
behind
it
the
schooner
was
recognized
it
was
the
which
visited
the
atoll
about
once
a
year
she
entered
the
pass
with
the
turn
of
the
tide
lighting
her
way
by
the
fire
which
was
burning
in
a
primitive
galley
a
box
half
filled
with
sand
i
could
see
her
native
skipper
at
the
wheel
a
couple
of
sailors
preparing
to
take
in
sail
and
two
native
women
sitting
on
the
poop
with
a
great
pile
of
luggage
behind
them
one
of
these
was
tepera
daughter
of
puarei
chief
of
the
atoll
who
had
been
sent
to
the
protestant
school
at
papeete
nearly
a
year
ago
the
other
was
tuarava
her
aunt
with
whom
she
had
been
living
there
the
crowd
on
the
beach
waited
in
deep
silence
while
the
schooner
anchored
and
the
sails
were
being
furled
i
remember
that
i
could
hear
very
plainly
the
rumbling
of
the
surf
on
the
windward
side
of
the
atoll
and
the
hissing
of
frying
fish
or
whatever
it
was
a
native
boy
was
cooking
at
the
galley
fire
then
the
small
boat
was
lowered
and
the
women
brought
ashore
with
their
luggage
tepera
went
at
once
to
her
father
and
putting
her
head
on
his
shoulder
began
to
cry
softly
not
a
word
was
spoken
tuarava
and
poura
her
sister
squatted
on
their
heels
close
by
their
arms
around
each
other
moaning
in
the
same
softly
audible
way
the
women
then
went
in
turn
among
all
their
relatives
having
their
little
cry
while
the
rest
of
the
village
looked
on
in
sympathetic
silence
when
they
had
finished
a
fire
was
lit
on
the
beach
and
everyone
gathered
around
to
hear
the
news
and
to
examine
the
schooner
s
cargo
which
was
being
put
on
shore
more
trade
goods
for
moy
ling
i
thought
remembering
my
debt
i
couldn
t
summon
any
great
amount
of
interest
in
the
scene
i
was
about
to
return
to
my
house
when
huirai
came
bustling
up
carrying
my
sea
chest
you
like
this
he
said
what
he
meant
was
is
this
yours
but
for
once
he
misused
his
english
with
splendid
relevancy
i
sat
down
weakly
on
the
box
holding
a
letter
which
he
had
thrust
into
my
hand
no
doubt
of
it
it
was
my
box
and
the
letter
was
addressed
to
me
in
tino
s
familiar
handwriting
it
read
in
part
as
follows
we
have
just
met
the
here
at
hao
she
is
going
to
rutiaro
within
a
few
weeks
so
i
am
sending
your
sea
chest
by
her
sorry
i
left
you
in
that
hole
but
i
was
tight
that
evening
and
pretty
mad
at
the
way
you
upset
my
plans
with
your
foolishness
next
morning
when
i
sobered
up
i
felt
like
going
back
for
you
but
we
had
a
fair
wind
and
i
had
my
cargo
to
think
of
the
price
of
copra
is
on
the
down
grade
and
i
ve
got
to
get
back
to
papeete
with
mine
before
the
bottom
falls
out
of
the
market
you
said
once
you
wanted
to
see
all
you
could
of
life
in
the
paumotus
well
i
guess
you
ll
have
your
chance
at
rutiaro
if
i
was
you
i
would
come
back
on
the
she
only
carries
tons
cargo
so
she
ll
probably
go
direct
to
papeete
from
there
i
am
also
sending
you
an
empty
demijohn
fill
this
with
water
before
you
leave
if
you
come
back
on
the
miti
her
skipper
is
a
good
sailor
but
all
he
knows
about
navigation
you
could
write
on
a
postage
stamp
i
met
him
once
about
twenty
miles
south
of
fakahina
he
was
cruising
around
looking
for
angatau
which
was
seventy
miles
to
the
northeast
well
he
can
t
miss
tahiti
if
he
gets
within
a
hundred
miles
of
it
so
you
better
take
a
chance
and
come
back
with
him
but
don
t
forget
to
carry
your
own
supply
of
fresh
water
sometimes
these
little
native
boats
get
becalmed
and
it
s
no
joke
being
thirsty
at
sea
yours
tino
has
a
big
bunch
of
letters
for
you
from
your
friend
nordhoff
i
saw
the
packet
it
looks
as
though
it
had
been
traveling
some
nordhoff
he
says
is
in
tahiti
again
i
ll
probably
see
him
there
and
will
tell
him
to
wait
for
you
give
my
regards
to
all
the
marble
players
good
old
tino
he
did
me
nothing
but
good
turns
late
that
night
when
the
rest
of
the
villagers
had
crossed
the
pass
i
pried
open
the
lid
of
the
lost
the
found
my
belongings
just
as
i
had
left
camera
my
binoculars
and
charts
and
most
important
of
all
in
the
bottom
of
the
chest
wrapped
in
a
pair
of
trousers
my
pocketbook
i
didn
t
pay
moy
until
just
before
the
departure
of
the
schooner
and
staged
the
final
episode
at
an
hour
when
his
shop
was
filled
with
loungers
i
came
away
with
his
receipted
bill
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
and
the
consciousness
of
having
adequately
safeguarded
tradition
we
left
rutiaro
the
following
day
i
did
not
realize
until
the
moment
of
how
painful
the
farewells
would
be
as
soon
as
they
were
over
i
went
on
board
crawled
into
the
little
cabin
and
despite
the
cockroaches
and
copra
bugs
remained
there
until
the
schooner
had
left
the
pass
and
was
well
out
to
sea
after
our
separation
at
papeete
nordhoff
went
on
to
the
southwest
he
wrote
me
from
an
island
he
called
ahu
ahu
and
from
there
apparently
he
took
passage
to
rarotonga
the
principal
island
of
the
cook
group
long
before
the
discovery
of
new
zealand
rarotonga
was
the
goal
of
polynesian
mariners
from
the
north
and
explorers
traveling
in
their
double
canoes
across
hundreds
of
leagues
of
ocean
guided
by
sun
and
stars
some
of
them
arriving
at
their
destination
many
others
doubtless
perishing
in
search
of
it
from
the
early
centuries
of
our
the
karika
family
to
reign
in
rarotonga
down
to
the
present
day
and
samoa
is
believed
to
have
been
the
principal
starting
point
of
the
voyagers
which
peopled
the
eastern
pacific
in
the
language
of
those
voyagers
meant
south
and
they
gave
that
name
to
the
friendly
islands
farther
to
the
west
and
south
they
came
upon
the
cook
those
days
no
doubt
the
southernmost
ends
of
the
the
high
island
of
this
group
the
faint
blot
on
the
horizon
which
led
the
canoes
to
land
they
called
rarotonga
under
the
south
the
illustration
woodcut
mother
s
the
hurricane
season
ended
in
a
fortnight
of
calm
before
the
trade
came
up
from
the
southeast
announcing
its
arrival
with
a
three
days
gale
that
caught
our
schooner
among
the
outer
islands
of
the
group
it
was
by
no
means
a
great
storm
yet
the
constant
fury
of
the
wind
unbroken
by
lull
or
gust
and
the
lines
of
huge
breaking
seas
running
under
a
cloudless
sky
impressed
me
more
than
anything
i
have
experienced
in
ships
by
day
we
lived
in
a
world
of
sky
sea
of
a
dark
angry
blue
acres
of
white
foam
to
go
on
deck
by
night
and
watch
the
leaping
ridges
of
salt
water
rear
up
to
threatening
fringed
with
wan
to
revise
any
beliefs
one
might
have
had
regarding
the
friendliness
of
nature
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
we
were
under
a
rag
of
foresail
riding
the
seas
obliquely
a
few
points
off
the
wind
the
schooner
took
them
like
an
eider
duck
it
was
so
thick
in
the
cabin
that
i
slid
back
the
hatch
and
squeezed
through
into
the
clean
turmoil
above
the
mood
of
the
pacific
was
too
impressive
for
pleasure
but
i
was
glad
at
least
of
the
fresh
air
and
able
to
derive
a
species
of
awed
enjoyment
from
what
went
on
about
me
it
may
have
been
fatigue
or
carelessness
or
any
rate
the
man
at
the
wheel
suddenly
allowed
the
schooner
to
bear
off
she
was
climbing
the
slope
of
a
sea
at
the
crest
of
it
caught
her
weather
side
with
a
crash
and
next
instant
a
rush
of
solid
water
swept
the
decks
thin
and
faint
as
the
voices
of
sea
birds
above
the
roaring
of
the
wind
the
cries
of
native
passengers
drifted
back
aue
the
hatch
slid
back
abruptly
the
skipper
burst
on
gesticulating
clad
in
a
deliver
an
address
in
passionate
mangaian
insulting
and
only
partially
audible
under
the
swinging
lamp
in
the
cabin
i
found
singular
and
philosophic
supercargo
whose
calm
no
ordinary
gale
could
over
his
books
a
bottle
and
a
glass
in
racks
at
his
elbow
a
mat
was
spread
on
the
floor
and
on
under
a
quilt
of
bright
apakura
his
young
native
wife
her
feet
were
bound
in
a
and
the
quilt
pulled
over
her
head
for
the
cockroaches
were
everywhere
i
entered
my
stateroom
to
lie
down
a
large
cockroach
insolent
and
richly
perfumed
trotted
along
the
springs
of
the
upper
berth
and
halted
just
above
my
face
waves
of
the
hand
had
no
effect
on
had
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
crush
him
in
his
tracks
one
of
his
comrades
began
a
tentative
nibbling
at
my
tickled
my
started
convulsively
the
sudden
rolls
of
the
schooner
flung
me
against
her
side
it
was
useless
to
try
to
sleep
as
i
sat
down
beside
him
tari
closed
his
books
and
motioned
me
to
fill
a
glass
a
faint
noise
of
shouting
came
from
on
deck
the
bell
sounded
a
sudden
and
peremptory
signal
the
hatch
opened
with
a
gust
of
head
of
the
skipper
appeared
dimly
in
the
swaying
light
he
shouted
i
m
going
to
run
into
the
lee
and
stand
off
and
on
till
this
blows
over
the
engine
started
and
tari
and
i
went
on
deck
for
a
glimpse
of
the
land
looming
close
and
vague
in
the
starlight
presently
as
we
took
our
seats
in
the
cabin
the
schooner
ceased
her
violent
pitching
and
began
to
ride
a
long
easy
swell
tari
rose
stepped
to
where
his
wife
lay
sleeping
picked
up
the
slender
bundle
in
the
quilt
and
disappeared
into
his
stateroom
next
moment
he
was
beside
me
again
uncorking
a
fresh
bottle
of
rum
she
s
had
a
bad
time
of
it
he
said
with
a
berth
on
the
weather
side
she
was
spilled
on
the
floor
half
a
dozen
times
before
she
gave
up
and
came
out
here
i
shouldn
t
have
let
her
come
had
my
doubts
of
the
weather
but
it
was
a
chance
to
see
the
relatives
she
s
got
scattered
through
the
group
they
re
constantly
visiting
one
another
blood
means
a
lot
down
here
where
they
recognize
degrees
of
consanguinity
absurdly
farfetched
to
our
minds
first
cousins
are
like
brothers
second
and
third
cousins
considered
members
of
one
s
immediate
family
and
so
on
through
the
descendants
of
remote
ancestors
when
you
stop
to
think
of
it
this
respect
for
ties
of
the
isolated
communities
of
on
a
solid
base
i
asked
him
a
question
concerning
the
end
of
these
island
they
will
fade
away
and
disappear
like
our
own
narragansett
and
seminole
without
leaving
their
mark
on
the
supplanting
race
or
whether
they
will
be
absorbed
gradually
developing
in
the
process
of
absorption
a
new
type
tari
set
down
his
glass
one
thing
is
certain
he
if
left
to
themselves
they
would
soon
be
extinct
wherever
you
go
among
the
islands
you
will
find
couple
after
couple
of
strong
wholesome
and
childless
no
doubt
the
white
man
is
partially
to
blame
but
for
myself
i
believe
the
race
is
worn
out
with
isolation
and
old
age
they
are
justified
in
their
dread
of
being
childless
but
an
infusion
of
european
a
miracle
you
must
have
noticed
this
to
me
a
most
striking
and
significant
fact
it
is
the
cross
of
white
and
brown
that
is
repopulating
the
islands
one
can
venture
a
glimpse
into
the
future
and
see
the
process
of
absorption
polynesian
is
not
fated
to
disappear
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
and
perhaps
it
will
be
more
than
a
trace
for
children
cling
strongly
to
the
distaff
side
the
question
of
is
an
interesting
one
particularly
to
men
like
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
struggle
against
nature
in
the
end
the
solution
is
nearly
always
the
same
varana
s
children
furnish
the
best
example
i
have
run
ve
never
been
to
rimarutu
i
fancy
it
is
not
often
visited
nowadays
probably
you
ve
never
heard
of
varana
and
yet
he
was
an
extraordinary
man
his
life
an
almost
unique
study
in
extremes
like
everything
real
the
story
has
no
beginning
unless
one
were
able
to
trace
back
the
strain
that
gifted
the
man
with
his
exceptional
temperament
as
for
an
end
that
is
still
working
itself
out
on
rimarutu
it
is
in
fact
no
story
at
all
but
a
bit
of
life
by
any
dominating
situation
haphazard
inconclusive
grimly
logical
no
one
can
know
the
whole
of
play
of
motives
the
decisions
the
pure
i
worked
with
varana
for
years
and
have
patched
his
story
together
after
a
fashion
now
and
then
when
the
mood
struck
him
he
used
to
speak
of
himself
sometimes
at
night
when
we
were
working
his
schooner
from
island
to
island
sometimes
by
day
as
we
lay
smoking
under
the
palms
of
a
remote
atoll
while
the
canoes
of
the
divers
dotted
the
lagoon
on
those
occasions
i
had
glimpses
of
a
man
not
to
be
judged
by
the
standards
of
everyday
man
actuated
by
motives
as
simple
as
they
were
incomprehensible
to
those
about
him
his
death
if
he
is
but
i
will
speak
of
that
in
its
place
his
real
name
was
big
man
and
a
little
dreamy
in
manner
with
an
immense
blond
mustache
and
a
serenity
nothing
could
disturb
i
never
knew
him
to
hesitate
in
making
a
decision
or
to
speak
unless
he
had
something
to
say
all
decent
men
liked
him
and
the
natives
who
were
better
able
than
a
white
man
to
fathom
his
simplicity
took
to
him
from
the
first
he
had
been
miserably
out
of
place
in
through
cambridge
which
he
detested
unhappily
married
done
out
of
a
fortune
by
the
defaulting
whose
last
debt
he
paid
and
divorced
just
before
he
came
out
here
it
is
often
observed
that
when
an
englishman
s
feelings
are
hurt
he
travels
and
in
this
respect
varana
was
not
exceptional
one
day
a
little
more
than
a
generation
ago
he
stepped
off
the
mail
boat
at
rather
typical
english
tourist
i
in
tropical
costumes
from
bond
street
and
accompanied
by
an
extraordinary
quantity
of
luggage
at
the
club
he
ran
across
jackson
of
the
atoll
trading
old
man
liked
him
from
the
first
and
they
used
to
spend
the
evenings
together
lingering
over
their
glasses
talking
a
little
in
low
tones
a
fortnight
later
varana
left
as
quietly
as
he
had
in
one
of
jackson
s
schooners
for
a
cruise
through
the
paumotus
it
was
the
year
of
the
hurricane
at
motutangi
varana
s
boat
commanded
by
a
native
skipper
had
drifted
through
the
group
in
a
desultory
way
touching
at
an
island
here
and
there
to
pick
up
a
few
tons
of
copra
or
a
bit
of
shell
one
can
imagine
the
effect
on
a
newcomer
of
those
early
days
among
the
sunlit
days
when
gentle
breezes
filled
the
sails
of
the
vessel
skirting
the
shores
of
the
of
unearthly
peace
and
loveliness
bordered
by
leagues
of
green
and
the
nights
ashore
when
the
moon
rose
at
the
end
of
a
path
of
rippling
silver
and
the
people
gathered
before
their
thatched
houses
to
sing
it
was
not
long
before
varana
realized
that
he
had
found
his
anodyne
at
home
he
had
been
a
yachtsman
of
sorts
by
the
time
they
reached
motutangi
the
brown
skipper
was
leaving
a
good
part
of
the
working
of
the
schooner
to
his
guest
they
were
diving
in
the
lagoon
that
year
at
the
end
of
a
long
on
the
sort
of
closed
season
scrupulously
respected
by
the
natives
half
a
dozen
schooners
were
anchored
off
the
village
where
every
house
overflowed
with
people
from
the
surrounding
islands
and
by
day
their
canoes
blackened
the
water
above
the
patches
of
shell
the
hurricane
gave
ample
warning
of
its
told
me
as
much
as
that
he
had
spent
the
night
ashore
with
a
trader
whose
old
glass
rose
and
fell
spasmodically
sinking
always
a
little
lower
until
it
stood
at
a
figure
which
sent
the
trader
off
white
and
cursing
to
break
open
a
fresh
case
of
gin
none
of
the
divers
went
out
at
daybreak
with
the
other
people
they
stood
in
little
frightened
groups
before
the
houses
the
older
men
were
already
beginning
to
hack
off
the
tops
of
the
stout
palms
in
which
they
planned
to
roost
by
the
time
varana
came
off
in
a
canoe
the
schooners
were
double
anchored
the
wind
was
shifting
uneasily
in
sharp
gusts
and
a
tremendous
surf
was
thundering
on
the
outer
beach
the
native
skipper
like
the
people
ashore
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
coming
and
like
most
of
his
kind
his
spirit
broke
in
the
face
of
a
large
the
feeling
that
the
forces
of
nature
were
about
to
overwhelm
him
well
i
ve
been
through
one
can
t
say
that
i
blame
him
much
varana
found
him
not
exactly
in
a
funk
but
in
a
state
of
passive
resignation
hoping
vaguely
that
his
two
anchors
would
let
him
ride
it
out
inside
the
crew
was
clustered
on
the
after
deck
exchanging
scared
whispers
varana
who
had
the
instinct
of
a
sailor
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
next
moment
he
had
taken
command
of
the
schooner
without
a
word
of
protest
the
men
reefed
got
sail
on
her
heaved
up
one
anchor
and
cut
the
other
cable
varana
had
very
little
to
say
about
the
he
edged
out
through
the
pass
and
managed
to
claw
off
just
as
the
cyclone
struck
afterward
the
story
went
the
rounds
of
every
group
all
the
other
schooners
in
the
lagoon
as
well
as
most
of
the
people
ashore
were
lost
how
varana
weathered
it
without
piling
up
his
vessel
on
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
atolls
is
a
sort
of
miracle
a
week
later
when
he
had
sailed
his
battered
only
survivor
of
the
disaster
at
papeete
harbor
he
found
himself
famous
by
nightfall
for
the
native
captain
gave
him
entire
credit
for
the
achievement
old
jackson
s
imagination
was
touched
or
perhaps
it
was
the
destruction
of
so
many
rival
schooners
in
the
shell
and
copra
any
rate
he
acted
on
impulse
for
once
in
his
life
sent
for
varana
and
offered
him
a
remarkably
good
berth
with
a
fat
screw
attached
but
the
wanderer
only
smiled
and
shook
his
had
had
a
taste
of
the
outer
islands
it
shakes
one
s
faith
in
providence
to
realize
that
most
men
die
without
finding
the
place
in
life
for
which
they
were
designed
it
was
old
jackson
who
told
him
of
during
one
of
their
almost
silent
evenings
at
the
club
it
was
a
believe
that
a
man
could
shut
himself
off
from
the
world
the
mood
would
pass
in
time
but
if
varana
wished
seriously
to
try
it
he
would
find
no
better
place
than
rimarutu
there
was
some
copra
to
be
had
and
a
little
shell
in
the
lagoon
the
people
numbered
about
two
hundred
a
quiet
pleasant
lot
not
given
to
wandering
from
their
island
varana
had
salvaged
a
few
thousand
pounds
from
the
wreck
of
his
affairs
at
home
jackson
helped
him
pick
up
a
schooner
at
a
bargain
and
load
her
with
what
was
needed
there
was
some
difficulty
about
a
crew
but
his
uncanny
gift
with
the
natives
got
him
three
men
content
to
follow
his
fortunes
on
the
morning
when
he
shook
hands
with
the
old
man
stepped
aboard
his
boat
and
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
varana
severed
the
last
tie
with
the
world
he
had
known
i
could
tell
you
a
good
deal
about
his
life
on
the
worked
with
him
for
nearly
ten
years
he
began
by
renting
a
bit
of
his
store
and
copra
the
chief
and
setting
himself
to
learn
the
language
the
polynesian
is
a
shrewd
judge
of
character
they
saw
that
this
man
was
just
kindly
fearless
and
to
be
trusted
those
who
had
traveled
a
little
declared
varana
a
white
trader
who
respected
women
and
never
lay
on
his
veranda
in
a
stupor
surrounded
by
empty
bottles
he
seemed
to
know
instinctively
the
best
way
to
take
these
people
with
whom
from
the
very
first
he
found
himself
on
terms
of
a
mutual
understanding
they
regarded
him
with
a
mixture
of
liking
and
respect
not
accorded
us
perhaps
as
often
as
we
are
apt
to
think
he
worked
with
them
he
played
with
them
and
finally
took
a
daughter
of
the
island
as
his
it
was
characteristic
that
he
never
permitted
himself
to
run
barefoot
and
that
even
after
twenty
years
of
friendship
the
native
entering
varana
s
house
took
off
his
hat
i
remember
tupuna
as
a
woman
of
robust
and
grave
with
delicate
hands
and
masses
of
bright
rippling
hair
the
years
were
kind
to
in
middle
life
she
did
not
lose
a
certain
quiet
charm
make
no
were
happily
mated
this
man
turned
out
by
what
englishmen
believe
the
highest
civilization
in
the
world
and
the
daughter
of
an
island
chief
whose
father
had
been
a
savage
and
an
eater
of
men
she
was
not
spoiled
like
so
many
traders
wives
when
they
had
been
on
the
reef
she
walked
home
behind
carrying
the
torches
and
the
he
felt
for
her
an
affection
deep
as
it
was
undemonstrative
a
strong
attachment
proven
at
the
end
in
his
own
extreme
and
romantic
way
during
the
early
years
of
his
life
on
rimarutu
varana
had
enough
to
do
with
his
store
his
occasional
trips
for
supplies
and
his
work
for
the
betterment
of
the
island
people
he
found
them
living
on
fish
and
coconuts
depending
for
all
their
luxuries
on
a
dwindling
production
of
copra
he
showed
them
how
to
thin
their
palms
how
to
select
nuts
for
new
plantings
how
to
dry
their
copra
with
a
minimum
of
effort
the
shell
in
the
lagoon
was
nearly
exhausted
he
persuaded
the
chiefs
of
the
two
villages
to
forbid
diving
for
a
term
of
years
after
experiments
conducted
with
tupuna
s
aid
he
set
the
men
to
catching
flying
fish
which
swarmed
in
the
waters
about
the
island
and
taught
the
women
to
split
them
rub
in
salt
and
dry
them
on
lines
in
the
sun
rimarutu
is
high
as
atolls
or
six
yards
above
the
sea
in
spots
he
laid
out
beds
of
and
had
pits
dug
on
the
high
portions
of
the
island
lined
the
bottoms
with
rock
to
keep
the
taproots
from
salt
water
filled
them
with
humus
and
up
in
planted
breadfruit
mango
and
lime
brought
from
the
high
islands
to
the
north
at
long
intervals
when
in
need
of
something
that
only
civilization
could
rigging
or
a
new
set
of
went
north
with
a
cargo
of
copra
and
dried
fish
and
took
on
a
brief
charter
with
jackson
on
these
trips
he
visited
scores
of
islands
and
came
to
know
the
people
of
a
thousand
miles
of
ocean
it
was
not
until
his
son
was
born
that
varana
began
to
think
seriously
of
money
his
daughters
had
given
him
no
concern
he
explained
to
me
once
his
peculiar
philosophy
as
to
their
future
perhaps
he
was
right
with
their
happiness
in
mind
he
preferred
to
bring
them
up
as
island
education
or
knowledge
of
the
outside
world
and
no
greater
prospects
than
those
of
their
than
give
them
the
chances
of
the
usual
and
partially
europeanized
whose
most
brilliant
hope
is
marriage
with
a
white
man
of
the
inferior
sort
but
the
birth
of
terii
set
the
father
to
thinking
the
child
was
about
ten
when
i
saw
him
first
a
fine
strong
boy
very
fair
for
a
with
his
father
s
eyes
a
high
carriage
of
the
head
and
skin
touched
with
a
faint
bloom
of
the
sun
tupuna
was
immensely
proud
of
him
i
was
a
youngster
then
and
new
to
the
islands
but
i
had
heard
of
varana
before
jackson
introduced
me
to
him
it
was
at
jackson
s
place
on
the
upper
veranda
that
he
told
me
how
he
had
leased
fatuhina
some
one
had
spoken
of
my
work
i
had
operated
diving
machines
he
needed
a
man
familiar
with
them
for
he
had
leased
an
atoll
with
some
big
shell
patches
in
the
lagoon
and
machines
would
be
necessary
to
work
the
deeper
portions
i
was
doing
nothing
at
the
time
i
liked
what
i
had
heard
of
varana
and
i
liked
the
man
better
still
in
an
hour
we
had
come
to
an
understanding
i
worked
with
him
off
and
on
from
that
time
until
the
beginning
of
the
war
without
caring
in
the
least
for
wealth
varana
had
set
out
to
make
himself
rich
long
before
i
knew
him
he
had
decided
the
question
of
his
son
terii
was
to
have
the
same
chances
that
his
father
had
had
before
to
see
both
sides
and
choose
for
himself
even
varana
s
friends
spoke
of
his
luck
to
my
mind
his
success
was
inevitable
regarded
with
an
almost
superstitious
affection
by
the
people
of
widely
scattered
groups
he
possessed
channels
of
information
closed
forever
to
the
ordinary
man
it
was
in
this
way
that
he
learned
of
the
shell
in
fatuhina
lagoon
perhaps
he
did
not
know
that
the
native
who
approached
him
one
evening
on
a
distant
atoll
to
speak
casually
of
the
matter
and
stroll
away
had
paddled
across
twelve
miles
of
sea
with
no
other
object
than
to
bring
the
news
to
varana
when
the
was
beached
he
was
the
first
to
learn
of
affair
alone
brought
him
a
neat
fortune
and
when
men
had
fine
pearls
to
sell
they
saw
him
before
they
went
to
the
jews
by
the
time
his
son
was
twelve
varana
was
a
rich
man
i
was
on
rimarutu
when
he
left
to
take
the
boy
to
england
tupuna
shed
a
few
tears
but
there
was
no
knew
he
would
return
i
go
to
take
our
son
to
my
own
land
he
told
her
there
will
be
six
moons
before
i
five
months
later
i
was
waiting
with
the
schooner
when
he
stepped
off
the
mail
boat
that
night
as
he
lay
on
a
mat
on
the
afterdeck
dressed
in
a
and
a
pair
of
slippers
he
spoke
of
england
briefly
in
the
midst
of
our
talk
on
island
matters
damned
senseless
treadmill
he
remarked
i
can
t
think
how
i
stood
it
so
many
the
ordinary
man
who
had
left
home
under
a
cloud
of
misfortune
to
return
twenty
years
later
after
wanderings
in
distant
lands
with
a
fortune
and
a
beautiful
child
would
have
lingered
not
without
a
certain
relish
but
varana
was
different
he
grudged
every
moment
spent
in
civilization
and
lived
only
for
the
day
when
he
would
again
take
the
wheel
of
his
schooner
and
watch
the
ridges
of
tahiti
sink
beneath
the
horizon
the
years
passed
rapidly
and
tranquilly
on
rimarutu
the
days
of
varana
s
activity
were
over
he
was
no
longer
young
though
he
kept
his
store
and
took
the
schooner
out
at
long
intervals
for
supplies
then
came
the
outbreak
of
the
war
i
was
in
gallipoli
when
the
letter
reached
me
written
in
the
native
language
by
varana
s
old
mate
it
told
a
story
fantastically
from
the
viewpoint
of
everyday
yet
to
me
who
knew
him
as
to
the
people
of
his
island
the
end
of
varana
seemed
a
natural
thing
in
keeping
with
what
had
gone
before
tupuna
had
fallen
ill
the
old
man
wrote
and
had
died
suddenly
and
peacefully
as
natives
do
varana
stood
beside
her
grave
with
no
great
display
of
grief
returned
to
his
house
and
spent
three
days
putting
his
affairs
in
order
on
the
fourth
day
he
gave
the
mate
a
thick
envelope
of
documents
called
together
the
people
of
the
island
and
bade
each
one
of
them
farewell
when
he
turned
to
leave
they
did
not
disperse
the
women
had
begun
to
felt
already
the
desolation
of
a
final
parting
it
was
the
hour
of
sunset
when
the
trade
wind
dies
away
and
the
lagoon
lies
like
a
mirror
under
an
opalescent
sky
i
can
see
in
imagination
those
simple
and
friendly
islanders
standing
in
little
groups
before
the
no
voice
in
protest
moving
no
hand
in
the
man
they
loved
walked
to
the
ocean
beach
launched
a
tiny
canoe
in
the
surf
and
paddled
out
to
the
west
the
nearest
land
in
that
direction
is
distant
six
hundred
miles
when
he
had
passed
the
did
not
once
turn
his
head
the
watchers
stood
motionless
while
the
sky
faded
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
dot
that
was
his
dwindling
dot
swallowed
up
at
last
in
the
night
tari
ceased
to
speak
he
was
sitting
propped
on
the
lounge
arms
folded
legs
stretched
out
eyes
staring
at
the
table
without
seeming
aware
of
what
he
did
he
filled
his
glass
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
drank
presently
he
emerged
from
his
revery
to
light
a
pipe
in
due
time
he
went
on
i
had
word
from
the
lawyers
inclosing
a
copy
of
the
will
and
informing
me
that
i
had
been
named
executor
with
old
jackson
who
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
secret
of
eternal
life
there
was
also
a
letter
from
varana
written
after
tupuna
s
friendly
and
casual
note
with
a
mere
line
at
the
end
asking
me
to
do
what
i
could
for
his
boy
the
land
tupuna
had
brought
him
was
to
be
divided
equally
among
his
daughters
all
the
rest
was
for
terii
saving
his
parting
gift
to
me
only
one
condition
was
must
visit
rimarutu
before
inheriting
the
property
of
his
father
once
he
had
set
foot
on
the
island
he
would
be
his
own
master
free
to
choose
his
path
in
life
the
boy
was
nineteen
when
the
war
broke
out
he
joined
up
at
once
as
a
cadet
in
the
flying
corps
during
the
second
year
i
began
to
hear
of
lieutenant
had
shot
down
a
german
plane
near
zeebrugge
he
had
been
wounded
he
had
received
the
military
cross
once
i
saw
his
picture
in
the
handsome
lad
very
smart
in
the
old
uniform
of
the
with
a
jaunty
cap
over
one
eye
and
ribbons
on
his
breast
this
was
the
little
savage
whose
shrill
cries
i
used
to
hear
at
dawn
when
he
raced
with
his
companions
on
the
beach
at
the
end
of
the
war
he
was
captain
terry
warner
a
celebrity
in
a
small
way
i
felt
a
certain
pride
in
him
of
course
we
had
done
our
best
to
meet
but
something
always
happened
to
prevent
my
getting
a
glimpse
of
him
i
ran
across
him
as
i
was
homeward
bound
leaving
san
francisco
for
the
islands
i
had
already
gone
aboard
and
was
standing
by
the
rail
watching
the
last
of
the
luggage
swing
over
the
side
in
nets
when
a
motor
drove
up
to
discharge
a
party
of
men
and
of
the
city
from
their
looks
one
of
them
a
lean
tanned
boy
with
the
overcoat
of
a
british
officer
over
his
civilian
clothes
was
saying
to
the
others
shaking
hands
and
smiling
very
attractively
a
little
later
when
the
lines
were
being
cast
off
i
saw
him
close
beside
me
at
the
rail
a
girl
in
blue
was
standing
on
the
dock
waving
up
at
him
terry
she
called
i
looked
closely
there
could
be
no
was
the
son
of
varana
we
had
long
talks
on
the
voyage
south
the
lad
had
not
forgotten
me
the
memory
of
the
old
the
island
of
his
mother
of
his
always
be
fresh
in
his
mind
but
he
regarded
those
days
as
a
distant
and
beautiful
episode
now
forever
closed
he
was
going
to
visit
rimarutu
for
the
last
bid
farewell
to
those
who
remembered
him
he
had
not
forgotten
the
friends
of
his
boyhood
there
were
many
little
presents
in
his
boxes
and
he
told
me
that
the
sound
as
on
the
day
of
her
be
his
gift
to
varana
s
old
mate
afterward
he
would
return
to
san
francisco
where
opportunities
had
been
offered
him
he
had
brought
letters
to
america
and
had
been
well
received
the
schooner
was
in
port
when
we
arrived
varana
s
mate
met
us
on
the
dock
there
were
tears
in
the
old
man
s
eyes
as
he
took
the
boy
s
hands
in
his
own
and
murmured
in
a
trembling
voice
terii
iti
the
tourists
descending
the
gangplank
looked
with
interest
at
the
spectacle
of
captain
warner
almost
embracing
an
old
barefoot
dressed
in
dungarees
and
a
faded
shirt
wrinkled
brown
face
working
with
emotion
as
terii
shook
hands
with
the
of
them
boys
with
whom
he
had
played
in
noticed
that
a
phrase
or
two
of
the
native
came
to
his
years
had
not
been
sufficient
to
blot
out
all
memory
of
his
mother
s
tongue
we
had
a
long
passage
south
beating
against
the
trade
varana
had
installed
an
engine
in
the
schooner
but
time
is
cheaper
than
petrol
in
this
part
of
the
world
terii
delighted
in
handling
the
boat
there
was
salt
water
in
his
blood
and
his
father
had
seen
to
his
training
in
navigation
and
the
ways
of
the
sea
with
each
new
day
i
perceived
symptoms
of
a
change
in
the
boy
white
suits
and
canvas
slippers
gave
way
to
pajamas
and
bare
feet
finally
the
pajamas
were
replaced
by
a
taken
from
the
stock
the
summers
at
home
had
not
been
wasted
i
used
to
watch
him
at
the
wheel
working
the
schooner
to
windward
an
eye
on
the
canvas
aloft
steering
with
the
easy
certain
movements
of
a
seaman
born
he
was
in
love
with
the
schooner
before
we
had
been
out
a
week
and
he
had
for
the
last
of
the
pelagic
sealing
varana
s
boat
was
the
fastest
thing
of
her
tonnage
in
the
south
seas
more
than
once
in
our
talks
terii
seemed
to
forget
the
plans
he
had
confided
to
me
she
needed
a
new
foresail
the
set
of
this
one
did
not
please
him
he
was
going
to
have
her
copper
renewed
in
places
she
was
getting
dingy
below
the
cabin
needed
a
touch
of
paint
at
times
speaking
of
these
things
he
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
and
changed
the
talk
to
other
subjects
the
language
came
back
to
him
surprisingly
he
was
able
to
understand
and
make
himself
understood
before
we
raised
the
palms
of
rimarutu
the
mate
took
her
in
through
the
pass
it
was
late
afternoon
cool
and
cloudless
with
a
gentle
sea
nuzzling
at
the
reef
the
island
was
like
the
memory
of
a
green
palms
snowy
beaches
cat
ruffling
the
lagoon
in
long
blue
beautiful
that
the
sight
of
it
made
one
s
heart
ache
and
the
breath
catch
in
one
s
throat
a
dozen
canoes
put
out
to
meet
us
from
the
first
settlement
there
were
greetings
from
friends
and
and
tears
terii
lay
silent
propped
on
his
elbows
and
staring
ahead
as
we
slipped
across
the
lagoon
the
island
people
spoke
in
tones
so
low
that
i
could
hear
the
crisp
sound
of
the
schooner
s
bows
parting
the
landlocked
water
the
other
village
lay
beyond
the
beach
ahead
of
us
varana
s
village
where
terii
had
been
place
of
dreams
in
the
mystery
of
the
evening
light
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
at
the
boy
s
moment
was
one
of
those
which
make
up
the
memories
of
a
lifetime
every
man
has
known
pain
the
enjoyment
of
supreme
beauty
the
flavor
of
exotic
and
unrepeatable
experience
but
not
every
man
is
permitted
to
taste
such
contrasts
as
this
boy
had
known
in
years
of
life
i
was
a
little
envious
i
think
of
the
rarity
of
that
poignant
on
the
first
evening
when
we
had
greeted
the
people
of
the
village
terii
was
led
away
by
his
old
aunt
tupuna
s
sister
just
before
bedtime
i
saw
them
at
his
mother
s
lonely
shrine
roofed
over
in
island
fashion
where
the
light
of
a
lamp
shone
on
stunted
bushes
of
frangipani
my
eccentricities
were
not
forgotten
they
had
spread
my
mat
under
the
palms
before
varana
s
house
and
toward
midnight
terii
came
quietly
and
lay
down
close
by
i
was
wakeful
in
a
revery
living
over
the
old
days
with
my
friend
wondering
with
the
usual
idle
and
somber
doubt
if
we
were
destined
to
meet
again
low
over
the
palm
tops
a
planet
glimmered
like
a
shaded
lamp
the
milky
way
arched
overhead
through
a
sky
powdered
with
fixed
suns
about
which
revolve
myriads
of
worlds
like
ours
i
rebelled
at
the
thought
that
the
strong
soul
of
varana
should
be
snuffed
out
terii
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
i
thought
he
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
but
suddenly
i
heard
his
voice
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
he
said
thoughtfully
if
my
father
were
here
i
could
believe
that
i
had
never
been
away
that
everything
since
i
school
my
friends
the
no
more
than
a
dream
i
can
t
explain
to
you
but
somehow
this
island
seems
the
most
real
thing
in
the
world
i
ve
been
talking
with
my
d
almost
forgotten
her
name
you
i
managed
to
understand
a
good
bit
of
what
she
had
to
say
there
is
no
doubt
she
believes
it
herself
my
father
comes
to
her
every
now
and
then
she
says
for
a
talk
on
family
matters
last
night
he
told
her
we
would
come
and
that
i
would
stop
here
to
take
his
old
place
among
the
people
it
seems
they
are
good
enough
to
want
me
to
almost
wish
i
the
drums
were
going
at
feast
in
terii
s
honor
was
the
greatest
the
island
had
known
since
heathen
days
the
entire
population
was
on
hand
the
beach
black
with
canoes
dozens
of
babies
on
mats
under
the
trees
with
small
brothers
and
sisters
stationed
to
fan
the
flies
away
the
people
sat
in
long
rows
in
the
shade
strings
of
shell
about
their
necks
their
heads
wreathed
in
hibiscus
and
sweet
fern
terii
was
placed
between
the
chief
of
the
other
village
and
tehina
the
chief
s
daughter
a
rimarutu
girl
of
sixteen
barefoot
dressed
in
a
white
frock
with
gold
pendants
in
her
ears
and
a
thick
shining
braid
of
hair
there
is
an
uncommon
charm
about
the
women
of
that
stamp
of
refinement
a
delicacy
of
frame
and
feature
remarked
as
long
ago
as
the
days
of
spanish
voyaging
in
the
pacific
blood
counts
for
something
in
polynesia
and
one
needed
only
a
glance
at
tehina
to
know
that
the
best
blood
of
the
island
flowed
in
her
veins
her
tradition
may
be
in
the
long
canoe
with
penipeni
when
the
god
pulled
rimarutu
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
like
those
people
and
in
spite
of
the
night
s
depression
i
managed
to
enjoy
the
even
danced
a
bit
finally
i
saw
that
the
dancers
were
taking
their
seats
voices
were
lowered
heads
were
turned
tehina
was
dancing
alone
to
the
rhythm
of
a
hundred
clapping
hands
in
twenty
years
of
the
islands
i
have
never
seen
a
girl
step
more
daintily
little
by
little
she
moved
toward
terii
until
she
stood
directly
before
him
inviting
him
to
dance
hands
fluttering
swaying
with
an
unconscious
grace
smiling
into
his
eyes
every
head
turned
there
were
smiles
chuckles
nudges
they
were
proud
of
this
girl
and
anxious
that
the
son
of
varana
should
dance
with
her
they
had
not
long
to
wait
next
moment
terii
had
leaped
to
his
feet
and
was
dancing
with
more
enthusiasm
than
skill
to
a
long
burst
of
cheers
and
clapping
when
the
canoes
put
off
at
nightfall
i
noticed
that
tehina
did
not
leave
she
had
stopped
to
visit
her
uncle
the
parson
of
the
village
church
i
saw
terii
with
her
often
during
the
days
that
on
the
lagoon
swimming
in
the
cove
lying
on
mats
in
the
moonlight
where
groups
of
young
people
were
telling
their
interminable
stories
of
the
past
he
seemed
a
little
shy
of
me
and
no
longer
exchanged
confidences
in
the
hour
which
precedes
sleep
one
evening
smoking
and
strolling
alone
after
dinner
i
passed
the
parson
s
house
and
became
aware
of
the
vague
figure
of
terii
walking
to
and
fro
impatiently
beside
the
veranda
he
heard
the
rattle
of
a
coral
pebble
on
the
roof
a
moment
later
tehina
glided
like
a
phantom
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
they
went
off
arm
in
arm
along
the
path
to
the
sea
i
thought
to
myself
that
the
lad
was
not
doing
badly
after
his
twelve
years
away
from
the
island
but
the
blood
was
in
him
of
was
instinct
in
his
manner
of
tossing
the
pebble
and
in
the
unhesitating
way
he
had
led
the
girl
toward
the
outer
beach
the
haunt
of
dreadful
presences
a
place
no
ordinary
islander
would
visit
after
dark
i
fancied
him
sitting
rumble
of
the
surf
in
his
ears
watching
the
lines
of
breakers
rear
up
under
the
tehina
beside
him
admiring
and
afraid
when
his
eye
was
not
on
her
she
would
glance
right
and
left
along
the
beach
and
back
toward
the
bush
half
expecting
to
see
some
monstrous
thing
crouched
and
watching
with
fiery
eyes
as
for
the
boy
one
could
only
guess
at
the
troubled
flow
of
his
thoughts
stirred
by
of
ancestry
and
experience
in
her
own
environment
tehina
was
a
girl
to
make
any
man
look
twice
for
him
with
his
mother
s
blood
and
the
memories
of
his
childhood
she
must
have
possessed
a
powerful
touch
of
her
hand
her
voice
soft
and
murmuring
the
words
of
a
tongue
her
dark
eyes
shining
in
the
moonlight
the
scent
of
the
strange
blossoms
in
her
hair
it
was
the
test
the
final
conflict
varana
had
foreseen
i
had
my
own
opinion
of
the
result
and
yet
the
other
life
pulled
hard
the
days
passed
in
pleasant
island
fashion
the
loading
of
the
schooner
went
on
there
was
no
mention
of
a
change
in
plans
the
chief
came
to
take
his
daughter
home
and
when
she
had
gone
terii
spoke
to
me
not
too
convincingly
of
his
return
to
civilization
my
trip
to
rimarutu
was
a
matter
of
pleasure
alone
i
was
already
planning
to
take
this
berth
and
was
not
sorry
when
terii
announced
one
morning
that
we
would
sail
north
that
afternoon
one
seems
perpetually
saying
down
islands
are
havens
of
a
brief
call
of
sad
farewells
of
lingering
and
regretful
memory
our
parting
from
the
people
of
rimarutu
was
more
than
usually
painful
they
had
hoped
to
the
last
that
terii
would
leave
some
word
some
promise
but
he
remained
silent
though
i
could
see
that
the
was
not
without
effect
finally
the
last
canoe
put
off
for
shore
the
anchor
came
up
the
motor
started
and
terii
steered
across
the
lagoon
for
the
pass
the
sails
were
still
furled
for
there
was
a
light
head
wind
i
watched
his
face
as
he
stood
in
silence
at
the
wheel
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
made
me
sorry
for
the
boy
we
crossed
the
lagoon
glided
past
green
islets
and
drew
abreast
of
the
other
village
the
people
lined
the
shore
fluttering
handkerchiefs
shouting
good
wishes
and
farewells
beyond
the
settlement
the
pass
led
out
blue
and
deep
between
sunken
piers
of
coral
where
the
surf
thundered
in
patches
of
white
all
at
once
the
old
mate
sang
out
and
dot
was
on
the
water
ahead
of
us
a
swimmer
moving
out
from
land
to
cut
us
off
the
son
of
varana
turned
the
wheel
the
schooner
swung
inshore
i
heard
a
quick
command
and
felt
the
speed
of
the
engine
slacken
terii
was
staring
ahead
with
a
strange
or
premonition
was
at
work
i
looked
again
as
we
drew
near
a
cloud
of
dark
hair
floated
behind
the
swimmer
s
head
it
was
a
terii
sprang
to
the
rail
a
moment
later
she
had
been
lifted
over
the
side
and
was
standing
beside
him
in
the
cockpit
dripping
trembling
a
little
with
cold
and
fear
doing
her
best
to
smile
the
mate
was
pulling
at
terii
s
arm
and
pointing
back
toward
the
village
a
whaleboat
had
put
out
from
shore
and
was
heading
for
us
at
the
top
speed
of
the
rowers
it
was
the
chief
himself
i
believe
who
stood
in
the
stern
and
whose
shouts
were
beginning
to
reach
our
ears
at
that
moment
terii
proved
that
he
was
his
father
s
son
he
glanced
back
once
and
then
without
the
smallest
interval
of
hesitation
his
arm
went
about
the
wet
shoulder
of
tehina
full
speed
ahead
he
ordered
in
a
cool
voice
tari
poured
rum
into
my
glass
and
tilted
the
last
of
the
bottle
into
his
own
the
schooner
was
taking
it
easily
with
her
engine
at
half
speed
riding
a
gentle
swell
the
ship
s
bell
rang
twice
paused
and
rang
sharp
and
mellow
sound
it
was
long
past
midnight
if
you
ever
get
down
to
rimarutu
said
tari
as
he
rose
to
go
on
deck
you
will
find
terii
bids
fair
to
leave
the
island
even
less
than
varana
did
the
cook
i
was
close
to
beginning
this
letter
with
a
little
fun
at
your
expense
you
would
have
been
convinced
that
my
haunted
friends
of
ahu
ahu
were
just
a
bit
uncanny
it
is
really
a
pity
not
to
do
it
i
should
have
begun
with
a
vivid
glimpse
of
a
séance
the
quiet
moonlight
outside
seen
through
an
open
door
the
glimmer
of
a
lamp
in
the
house
revealing
the
rapt
sightless
face
of
the
medium
the
summoning
of
old
rakamoana
from
her
sleeping
place
in
the
the
unnatural
voice
proclaiming
the
coming
of
the
spirit
then
i
would
have
told
how
a
message
from
the
visitor
was
the
strange
white
man
vouched
for
by
the
mother
of
apakura
i
see
an
island
the
ghostly
voice
might
have
gone
a
little
land
surrounding
a
great
lagoon
it
is
nukuhina
in
the
sea
of
atolls
a
schooner
lies
at
anchor
in
the
calm
water
off
the
settlement
she
does
not
move
for
the
lagoon
is
very
still
a
boat
is
putting
off
for
shore
and
in
the
stern
sits
a
dear
friend
of
the
white
slender
man
who
gazes
eagerly
toward
the
shore
with
dark
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
our
people
a
crowd
is
gathered
on
the
beach
the
girls
carry
gifts
of
necklaces
and
wreaths
and
in
the
village
the
old
women
are
preparing
a
feast
the
man
in
the
boat
believes
that
this
welcome
is
for
the
captain
of
the
schooner
not
knowing
that
this
people
was
once
a
race
of
warriors
and
that
they
are
gathered
to
give
him
first
soldier
from
the
army
of
france
to
visit
their
island
since
the
war
the
keel
of
the
boat
grates
on
the
sand
a
score
of
men
seize
her
to
pull
her
up
the
women
crowd
about
the
stranger
aué
they
are
good
to
look
upon
these
girls
of
nukuhina
to
throw
their
necklaces
over
his
head
and
crown
him
with
wreaths
of
flowers
and
shell
his
face
grows
red
the
old
men
smile
the
girls
laugh
aloud
one
bolder
than
the
rest
runs
at
him
suddenly
puts
her
arms
about
him
and
kisses
him
after
the
fashion
of
the
white
man
his
face
grows
redder
still
at
that
the
old
men
too
laugh
aloud
one
after
another
pushing
and
pulling
to
be
first
the
girls
scramble
to
kiss
him
he
is
overwhelmed
suffocated
and
now
his
face
is
like
fire
but
he
is
not
angry
for
he
smiles
well
what
do
you
think
of
ahu
ahu
magic
i
really
ought
to
refrain
from
telling
you
the
truth
the
stuff
of
most
spirit
simple
unexpected
and
disillusioning
when
we
got
to
avarua
i
found
there
over
from
tahiti
to
buy
cattle
before
his
departure
the
had
turned
up
from
the
paumotus
bringing
word
of
your
reception
on
nukuhina
i
fancy
you
haven
t
had
much
time
in
your
progress
through
the
low
archipelago
for
the
pursuits
of
a
landsman
so
i
ll
give
you
an
idea
of
how
i
ve
frittered
away
the
days
on
rarotonga
soon
after
our
arrival
there
was
a
great
stir
over
the
coming
of
a
shipload
of
parliamentary
visitors
from
new
zealand
making
a
tour
of
the
cook
islands
a
feast
of
welcome
was
to
be
given
in
avarua
scores
of
pigs
and
hundreds
of
chickens
were
set
aside
for
fattening
and
the
dancers
of
each
village
were
to
be
seen
rehearsing
in
the
evenings
we
drove
to
avarua
on
the
appointed
day
and
found
the
government
boat
already
anchored
in
the
roadstead
off
the
anchorage
dreaded
by
skippers
for
unless
the
anchor
strikes
exactly
on
the
summit
of
a
sharp
submerged
peak
it
will
slide
clean
off
soundings
long
before
we
reached
the
settlement
the
air
had
been
vibrant
with
the
sound
of
drums
the
visitors
were
coming
ashore
the
dancing
was
in
full
swing
the
performance
of
course
was
a
perfectly
sophisticated
papeete
avarua
is
a
small
ocean
metropolis
the
capital
of
a
it
interested
me
to
see
that
the
people
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
missionaries
to
make
them
ashamed
of
everything
pertaining
to
heathen
days
were
not
entirely
without
pride
in
the
past
each
village
was
represented
by
a
corps
of
dancers
men
and
women
equally
divided
and
had
its
own
drums
and
drummers
who
furnished
the
sole
music
of
the
dance
the
drums
are
of
three
varieties
the
smallest
are
merely
hollow
inches
in
diameter
and
a
yard
on
one
side
and
producing
a
loud
resonant
click
when
struck
with
a
bit
of
wood
there
are
others
of
medium
size
standing
on
short
legs
and
beaten
with
the
hand
but
the
huge
oldtime
drums
suspended
from
the
limbs
of
trees
interested
me
most
of
all
imagine
a
section
of
the
trunk
of
a
big
carefully
hollowed
out
and
smoothed
with
the
skins
of
wild
goats
stretched
over
the
ends
and
sides
decorated
with
outlandish
painting
the
big
drums
are
struck
with
the
heel
of
the
such
furious
energy
that
the
drummer
streams
perspiration
and
is
soon
exhausted
the
deep
pulsing
sound
of
them
carries
for
miles
in
still
air
sometimes
at
night
when
there
was
dancing
in
the
villages
i
have
heard
it
far
and
near
rising
falling
throbbing
from
arorangi
from
titikaveka
and
from
ngatangiia
whence
the
ancients
set
out
on
their
voyages
to
the
south
i
wish
i
could
make
you
feel
as
i
have
felt
the
quality
of
this
savage
drumming
monotonous
and
rhythmic
sound
reduced
almost
to
its
simplest
form
it
is
the
ancestor
of
all
music
toward
which
perhaps
our
modern
dance
music
is
a
reversion
there
is
syncopation
in
it
when
the
big
drum
halts
at
irregular
intervals
and
the
time
is
carried
by
the
clicking
of
hollow
wood
but
it
is
solemn
and
but
the
meretricious
syncopation
of
ragtime
one
feels
in
it
an
appeal
to
the
primitive
emotions
at
once
vague
and
charged
with
meaning
fear
and
madness
are
there
with
cruelty
lust
triumph
and
a
savage
melancholy
except
in
the
case
of
the
contingent
from
atoll
far
off
to
the
was
little
variation
in
the
dances
for
which
one
can
only
say
that
they
showed
evidence
of
careful
drilling
the
women
performed
a
variety
of
the
dance
common
to
all
branches
of
their
the
same
whether
called
or
their
motions
were
awkward
and
stiff
without
the
abandon
and
graceful
movements
of
the
arms
to
be
seen
in
hawaii
or
the
society
islands
the
men
who
carried
long
staves
like
spears
were
freer
in
their
motions
leaping
thrusting
out
their
arms
and
clattering
their
sticks
in
unison
the
for
the
eye
of
a
sensitive
slipped
on
over
the
wearer
s
best
european
clothes
a
concession
to
the
missionary
point
of
view
but
the
beauty
of
some
of
the
kilts
tunics
and
headdresses
and
the
trouble
evidently
taken
in
braiding
them
showed
that
the
rarotongans
have
not
wholly
forgotten
the
past
the
dance
was
followed
by
speeches
and
the
speeches
by
a
very
conventional
and
uninteresting
i
wonder
if
you
are
heartily
fed
up
on
baked
pig
one
needs
a
dash
of
island
blood
to
appreciate
it
after
the
twentieth
time
any
other
sort
of
meat
would
be
welcome
here
where
bully
beef
and
pork
are
the
staples
the
need
of
a
change
of
diet
drives
one
to
the
lagoon
fishing
becomes
a
practical
as
well
as
a
sporting
proposition
during
the
proper
phases
of
the
moon
we
lead
a
most
irregular
life
for
the
hours
from
to
are
often
the
ones
most
profitable
to
spend
on
the
reef
and
the
evenings
are
occupied
with
a
search
for
hermit
crabs
you
have
probably
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
hermit
crab
but
in
case
you
have
been
too
busy
to
give
him
the
notice
he
deserves
i
ll
venture
to
dwell
for
a
bit
on
his
eccentricities
it
was
not
a
pure
love
of
natural
history
that
turned
my
attention
to
him
i
have
been
obliged
to
study
least
the
fact
that
he
is
the
dainty
preferred
by
all
the
fish
of
this
lagoon
and
his
capture
therefore
an
indispensable
preliminary
to
every
fishing
expedition
there
must
be
several
varieties
of
hermit
have
counted
three
already
the
ordinary
small
brown
one
called
the
huge
red
one
found
in
deep
water
and
the
black
hairy
kind
whose
body
is
mixed
with
grated
coconut
to
extract
the
oil
this
latter
is
called
in
the
old
days
the
lowest
class
of
rarotonga
society
was
known
by
the
same
i
suppose
that
all
of
their
property
could
be
carried
on
their
backs
the
common
variety
is
a
good
deal
like
the
robber
crab
in
habits
the
natives
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
the
same
creature
in
different
stages
of
its
existence
i
doubt
this
theory
for
while
there
are
plenty
of
the
little
on
the
volcanic
islands
the
robber
crab
is
very
rare
he
lives
on
the
atolls
and
to
my
mind
it
is
incredible
that
he
should
journey
from
island
to
island
through
leagues
of
deep
sea
like
his
formidable
relative
the
spends
most
of
his
time
ashore
frequenting
the
bush
along
the
water
s
edge
where
he
lies
hidden
throughout
the
day
in
a
hole
or
under
a
pile
of
leaves
his
first
duty
of
the
evening
is
a
trip
to
salt
water
for
he
seems
to
need
a
thorough
wetting
once
in
each
hours
after
his
bath
he
heads
back
for
the
bush
to
begin
his
nightly
search
for
any
kind
of
edible
dead
fish
on
the
beach
the
fallen
fruit
of
a
pandanus
a
coconut
opened
by
rat
or
flying
fox
and
containing
a
few
shreds
of
meat
the
size
of
the
can
be
judged
from
his
shell
which
may
be
as
small
as
a
thimble
or
as
large
as
an
orange
the
creature
inside
is
marvelously
adapted
to
the
life
he
leads
his
soft
and
muscular
body
curls
into
the
spiral
of
the
shell
and
is
securely
anchored
by
a
twist
of
the
tail
the
of
the
crab
which
protrudes
from
the
shell
when
he
is
in
motion
reminds
one
of
a
tiny
lobster
the
same
stalk
eyes
the
same
legs
the
same
strong
claws
when
alarmed
he
snaps
back
into
his
mobile
fortress
and
you
perceive
that
legs
and
claws
fold
into
a
flat
armored
barrier
sealing
up
perfectly
the
entrance
of
the
shell
sit
still
and
watch
him
presently
the
claws
unfold
cautiously
and
he
emerges
little
by
little
feelers
waving
and
eyes
peering
about
in
a
ludicrously
apprehensive
manner
finally
he
gathers
courage
and
starts
off
for
the
bush
at
his
curious
rolling
gait
one
might
suppose
the
hermit
crab
the
least
social
of
living
tilings
but
in
reality
he
is
gregarious
and
seems
to
enjoy
the
company
of
his
friends
they
wander
in
little
bands
very
often
one
finds
two
or
three
small
ones
perched
on
the
back
of
a
larger
comrade
and
enjoying
an
effortless
trip
across
the
beach
to
the
lagoon
one
afternoon
i
came
upon
three
of
them
traveling
in
single
file
the
last
member
of
the
frail
little
under
the
heel
of
my
boot
before
i
saw
him
i
stopped
a
moment
in
regret
and
saw
that
the
two
other
crabs
were
also
by
i
know
not
what
obscure
sense
that
all
was
not
well
with
their
friend
they
drew
together
as
they
halted
and
went
through
a
hasty
and
obviously
anxious
exchange
of
to
face
with
feelers
waving
nervously
one
was
reminded
irresistibly
of
a
pair
of
fussy
little
old
gentlemen
halted
in
the
street
to
decide
which
should
do
an
unpleasant
errand
at
length
one
of
the
two
settled
himself
to
wait
while
the
other
faced
about
and
shambled
off
briskly
to
the
rear
a
few
seconds
brought
him
to
what
was
left
of
his
unfortunate
comrade
his
eyes
seemed
to
start
from
his
head
as
he
felt
over
the
crushed
wreck
a
moment
later
he
turned
and
hastened
back
even
faster
than
he
had
come
his
arrival
had
an
air
of
palpitating
excitement
i
fancied
i
felt
transmitted
to
me
a
tiny
thrill
of
horror
at
the
news
about
to
be
communicated
this
time
the
four
antennae
fairly
imagined
the
conversation
going
on
an
inch
above
the
ground
my
god
announced
the
bearer
of
ill
tidings
breathlessly
poor
bill
is
dead
bill
dead
exclaimed
the
other
shocked
in
spite
of
his
incredulity
but
no
you
must
be
could
have
killed
him
i
don
t
know
he
s
dead
all
the
and
upset
me
fearfully
come
ve
been
seeing
things
he
must
have
taken
a
short
cut
to
the
beach
i
tell
you
he
s
dead
come
and
have
a
look
if
you
don
t
believe
me
so
off
they
went
together
for
a
look
at
the
corpse
and
i
left
them
to
mourn
their
to
eat
him
if
you
want
to
see
a
curious
sight
get
a
hermit
crab
some
day
and
pick
up
half
a
dozen
empty
shells
of
the
size
to
fit
him
lay
the
shells
on
the
sand
in
a
circle
a
few
inches
across
extract
the
crab
without
hurting
him
from
his
house
and
set
him
down
naked
among
the
empty
shells
to
get
him
out
by
the
way
is
not
so
easy
as
it
sounds
but
you
can
do
it
by
taking
hold
of
his
claws
and
maintaining
a
steady
gentle
pull
in
time
the
muscles
of
his
tail
will
tire
and
his
grip
relax
you
will
be
amused
when
you
see
his
first
attempts
to
walk
without
his
shell
which
weighs
three
or
four
times
as
much
as
the
tenant
it
is
precisely
as
a
man
might
act
set
down
on
some
planet
where
gravity
is
weaker
than
on
our
earth
naked
helpless
and
très
crab
makes
a
dash
for
one
of
the
shells
gives
it
a
hasty
inspection
with
his
feelers
finds
something
not
quite
right
and
hobbles
off
to
the
next
one
perhaps
this
suits
him
he
faces
about
in
goes
his
tail
to
take
a
grip
on
the
whorls
he
snaps
in
and
out
a
few
times
as
if
trying
the
strategic
possibilities
of
the
new
quarters
and
next
moment
you
will
see
him
ambling
off
blissfully
toward
the
bush
the
chase
of
the
hermit
crab
is
tame
sport
no
doubt
but
not
entirely
without
interest
one
evening
we
set
out
just
after
dark
bucket
and
torch
in
the
old
south
sea
torch
of
coconut
leaf
but
the
modern
tube
of
galvanized
iron
filled
with
kerosene
and
plugged
with
burlap
which
acts
as
a
wick
the
high
beach
is
best
at
this
hour
for
one
s
quarry
is
beginning
to
emerge
from
the
bush
for
the
evening
dip
and
those
that
have
passed
will
leave
spoor
in
the
soft
coral
sand
here
is
the
track
of
a
small
one
winding
toward
the
water
in
eccentric
curves
and
zigzags
follow
it
and
you
find
him
motionless
in
the
torchlight
hoping
to
escape
notice
he
goes
into
the
pail
with
a
can
hear
his
feet
scratching
vainly
at
the
smooth
sides
there
were
not
many
about
on
this
stretch
of
beach
they
are
uncertain
in
their
habits
and
seem
to
be
great
wanderers
here
is
the
track
of
a
monster
broad
and
corrugated
like
the
trail
of
a
miniature
whippet
tank
the
spoor
leads
to
the
signs
of
him
at
the
water
s
has
doubled
back
lift
up
that
rotten
coconut
frond
an
black
hairy
armed
with
a
vicious
pair
of
claws
you
can
hear
him
raging
in
the
pail
a
noise
halfway
between
a
whine
and
a
crab
with
a
voice
a
stroll
of
an
hour
or
two
along
the
btuch
usually
procures
enough
bait
for
a
day
s
fishing
and
one
turns
inland
to
follow
the
road
home
sometimes
when
the
new
moon
has
set
behind
the
avarua
peaks
and
thick
darkness
settles
over
the
the
surf
murmurs
almost
maudibly
in
a
stillness
broken
by
the
plunge
of
a
fish
in
the
lagoon
or
the
grating
screech
of
a
quarreling
with
his
mates
in
the
palm
is
not
sorry
when
the
lights
of
the
plantation
begin
to
glimmer
through
the
trees
we
went
to
bed
early
that
evening
for
we
had
to
be
up
long
before
daylight
to
catch
the
first
of
the
flood
tide
but
these
island
nights
are
not
meant
for
was
soon
up
again
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
alone
on
the
veranda
the
feel
of
the
air
was
like
a
caress
neither
hot
nor
cold
and
perfumed
with
the
scents
of
strange
sweet
and
heady
frangipani
languorous
queen
of
the
night
in
the
mango
tree
behind
the
house
a
mynah
drowsy
overture
to
one
of
their
abrupt
nocturnal
choruses
they
are
quaint
birds
the
mynahs
introduced
to
the
islands
many
years
ago
they
have
increased
amazingly
in
this
friendly
environment
where
they
live
in
a
state
of
familiarity
with
mankind
one
sees
them
everywhere
hopping
fearlessly
about
the
streets
of
villages
fluttering
to
the
table
to
finish
the
bread
crumbs
left
after
a
meal
perched
on
the
backs
of
cattle
in
the
coconut
groves
they
are
intensely
gregarious
gathering
in
large
flocks
at
sunset
to
roost
in
some
mango
or
alligator
pear
from
time
to
time
during
the
night
with
an
abruptness
and
perfect
unison
that
make
one
suspect
the
presence
of
a
feathered
leader
of
the
orchestra
the
two
or
three
hundred
members
of
the
colony
burst
into
deafening
chorus
which
lasts
perhaps
twenty
seconds
and
stops
as
suddenly
as
it
began
at
last
i
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
my
pipe
and
turned
in
at
intervals
before
sleep
came
i
heard
the
thud
of
a
ripe
coconut
or
the
faint
slither
and
crash
of
an
old
frond
falling
from
a
palm
we
were
awakened
at
three
o
clock
by
the
cook
s
announcement
that
coffee
was
ready
it
is
a
pleasure
to
live
where
dressing
is
only
a
matter
of
slipping
on
a
fresh
singlet
and
hitching
the
tight
about
one
s
waist
each
man
carried
a
pair
of
old
shoes
for
even
the
leathery
feet
of
a
native
must
be
protected
before
he
ventures
on
the
live
coral
half
a
dozen
plantation
boys
followed
us
to
the
beach
along
a
path
leading
down
an
avenue
of
coconuts
the
slender
boles
illuminated
by
the
glare
of
torchlight
in
five
minutes
we
were
under
the
dark
ironwoods
at
the
water
s
edge
where
the
canoes
are
hauled
up
without
waiting
for
us
the
boys
plunged
into
the
swimming
half
wading
toward
the
held
aloft
in
their
left
hands
the
tide
was
very
low
we
had
only
a
short
paddle
to
the
shallow
water
on
the
inner
side
of
the
barrier
it
was
dead
weather
for
the
there
had
been
a
storm
somewhere
to
the
south
lines
of
tall
glassy
combers
faintly
visible
in
the
starlight
were
curling
with
the
splitting
reports
of
field
down
on
the
reef
until
the
coral
beneath
us
seemed
to
tremble
at
each
shock
the
eastern
sky
had
not
yet
begun
to
constellations
glimmered
with
the
soft
glow
of
the
tropics
the
southern
cross
orion
and
the
pleiades
when
the
water
was
only
we
moored
the
canoe
to
a
coral
mushroom
and
went
overboard
in
bare
legs
and
wading
slowly
about
twenty
feet
lagoon
so
still
and
clear
that
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
where
air
ended
and
water
moving
in
the
circle
of
torchlight
could
escape
notice
it
was
necessary
to
watch
the
bottom
and
walk
warily
the
reef
is
a
honeycomb
of
holes
and
passages
through
which
the
sea
boils
in
at
certain
tides
many
of
these
holes
only
a
few
feet
in
diameter
at
the
surface
lead
deep
down
and
out
into
the
caverns
lining
the
edges
of
the
haunts
of
octopus
and
the
called
a
faint
ripple
revealed
a
big
blue
parrot
fish
skulking
in
the
shadow
of
a
bowlder
one
of
the
native
boys
slipped
his
spear
close
before
he
thrust
with
a
skill
that
needs
years
to
acquire
he
killed
the
fish
with
a
stab
just
where
the
head
joins
the
body
and
strung
it
on
the
strip
of
hibiscus
bark
at
his
waist
these
lagoons
swarm
with
strange
forms
of
life
unknown
in
northern
waters
until
one
learns
one
s
way
about
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
danger
in
wading
through
the
shallows
along
the
reef
a
sea
scorpion
passed
close
by
thing
all
feelers
and
enormous
fins
a
touch
of
those
spines
would
give
you
a
nasty
leg
an
even
more
poisonous
fish
is
found
fortunately
not
often
the
which
lies
buried
in
patches
of
coral
sand
i
have
never
seen
one
and
do
not
know
its
name
in
english
but
the
spines
of
its
dorsal
fin
are
said
to
be
hollow
like
the
fangs
of
a
rattlesnake
and
to
inject
a
stepped
is
apt
to
kill
or
cripple
for
life
the
or
sea
porcupine
is
another
odd
creature
but
not
at
all
to
be
feared
at
the
approach
of
danger
he
blows
himself
up
like
a
football
and
once
inflated
is
proof
against
almost
ve
seen
a
man
hurl
a
heavy
stone
on
one
a
dozen
times
without
being
able
to
burst
him
open
in
a
different
way
the
conger
eels
are
nearly
as
hard
to
kill
particularly
the
big
ones
which
are
no
joke
to
handle
when
one
is
wading
barelegged
one
must
be
on
the
alert
every
blazing
spear
poised
one
moment
you
jump
on
a
mushroom
of
coral
to
avoid
a
pair
of
sea
snakes
long
slender
and
fearless
creatures
whose
bite
is
said
to
be
a
serious
matter
a
moment
later
you
are
slipping
and
scrambling
at
top
speed
to
cut
off
some
large
fish
working
his
way
through
the
shallows
one
of
the
boys
bagged
a
young
i
was
glad
to
have
a
look
at
the
ugly
little
brute
he
was
only
a
foot
marvel
of
protective
coloring
irregularly
spotted
and
blotched
so
as
to
be
nearly
invisible
against
a
background
of
coral
the
size
of
the
mouth
the
power
of
the
jaws
and
the
rows
of
cruel
little
teeth
convinced
me
that
the
fish
must
deserve
the
bad
name
given
him
by
the
pearl
divers
the
light
was
gray
and
the
cloud
banks
along
the
eastern
horizon
flushing
pale
rose
when
the
boys
extinguished
their
torches
and
set
out
across
the
lagoon
each
one
trailing
a
heavy
string
of
fish
my
host
had
had
enough
sport
for
once
but
i
love
to
be
on
the
water
at
dawn
so
when
i
had
landed
him
i
paddled
out
to
the
pass
to
fish
for
the
current
was
slack
and
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
lagoon
the
light
grew
stronger
the
contours
of
the
island
developed
in
sharp
serrations
against
the
sky
presently
the
sun
rose
i
anchored
the
canoe
in
a
fathom
of
water
at
the
edge
of
the
pass
allowing
her
to
swing
out
over
the
depths
through
my
i
could
examine
the
precipitous
walls
of
the
feet
high
overhanging
in
places
seamed
pitted
broken
by
the
dark
mouths
of
caverns
shoals
of
fish
moved
leisurely
along
the
face
of
the
and
disappearing
like
nesting
swallows
seen
from
a
swinish
parrot
fish
bright
blue
and
long
as
a
man
s
arm
spangled
orange
and
to
nibble
at
the
coral
slender
pipefish
swift
fish
of
extraordinary
form
and
perhaps
undescribed
at
last
i
saw
what
i
was
school
of
working
in
from
the
sea
i
wonder
if
you
know
this
fish
it
is
new
to
me
though
i
have
been
told
that
it
exists
in
the
northern
pacific
it
is
of
the
true
game
and
the
conformation
of
a
mackerel
and
related
i
should
say
to
the
pompano
of
american
waters
the
young
ones
eight
to
ten
inches
long
and
appearing
at
certain
times
of
year
in
great
schools
are
called
when
from
two
pounds
up
to
is
known
as
in
the
cook
islands
in
tahiti
and
to
the
east
the
fully
grown
fish
which
attains
a
weight
of
a
hundred
pounds
or
more
is
called
these
different
names
for
stages
in
the
life
of
the
same
fish
are
interesting
to
me
for
they
illustrate
the
richness
in
certain
directions
of
a
language
so
poor
in
others
we
have
such
terms
in
english
but
they
are
rapidly
becoming
obsolete
i
doubt
for
example
if
the
average
man
at
home
knows
that
a
young
salmon
is
called
a
grilse
and
a
still
younger
one
a
parr
one
s
outfit
for
this
kind
of
fishing
consists
of
a
pail
of
hermit
crabs
a
couple
of
stones
for
crushing
them
a
hundred
feet
of
stout
cotton
line
a
single
hook
on
a
length
of
piano
wire
and
several
dozen
pebbles
to
be
used
as
sinkers
first
of
all
you
smash
the
shells
of
a
few
crabs
tear
off
the
soft
bodies
for
bait
and
crush
the
claws
and
legs
to
a
paste
this
chum
is
thrown
overboard
little
by
little
to
attrach
the
fish
and
keep
them
about
the
canoe
when
a
glance
through
the
shows
that
the
fish
you
want
are
gathered
beneath
you
a
pebble
is
attached
to
the
line
by
means
of
a
special
hitch
which
can
be
undone
by
a
jerk
now
you
lower
the
line
over
the
side
until
the
bait
is
in
the
required
position
a
sharp
pull
frees
the
sinker
and
you
are
ready
for
the
first
client
the
theory
of
the
detachable
sinker
is
that
it
enables
one
to
fish
at
a
distance
from
the
boat
without
having
the
hook
rest
on
the
bottom
where
it
is
apt
to
foul
in
the
coral
on
this
occasion
my
sport
was
ruined
by
one
of
those
tantalizing
incidents
which
lend
charm
to
every
variety
of
angling
i
had
caught
two
fish
and
was
lowering
my
line
to
try
for
a
third
when
the
small
fry
gobbling
my
chum
suddenly
scattered
and
disappeared
next
moment
a
monstrous
in
the
up
from
the
depths
seized
my
bait
and
made
off
so
fast
that
the
line
fairly
scorched
my
fingers
my
tackle
was
not
designed
for
such
game
as
was
nothing
to
do
but
try
to
play
him
but
when
only
a
yard
of
line
remained
in
my
hands
i
was
forced
to
check
the
rush
a
powerful
wrench
the
line
slackened
dead
he
was
off
the
light
hook
had
snapped
at
the
i
had
no
other
the
old
old
is
never
the
fingerlings
that
get
away
cut
into
filets
and
soaked
for
six
hours
in
lime
juice
my
two
fish
made
a
raw
d
of
the
most
delicate
kind
i
took
a
plate
of
it
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor
who
had
asked
me
to
dinner
and
this
in
the
south
seas
pronounced
it
of
the
very
first
order
you
would
enjoy
knowing
him
he
has
been
in
this
part
of
the
world
since
the
skipper
trader
on
islands
seldom
visited
even
now
he
is
retired
and
lives
on
a
small
plantation
which
represents
the
savings
of
a
lifetime
after
dinner
as
we
sat
on
his
wide
veranda
with
pipes
going
and
glasses
on
the
table
between
us
he
told
me
a
tale
so
curious
that
i
can
not
resist
repeating
it
to
story
of
an
island
far
away
to
the
north
and
island
i
shall
call
atolls
are
by
nature
lonely
places
but
of
all
atolls
in
the
pacific
ariri
is
perhaps
the
visited
far
off
from
any
group
out
of
the
paths
of
navigation
not
very
many
years
ago
ariri
was
a
bit
of
no
man
s
land
though
marked
on
the
chart
its
existence
was
ignored
by
the
had
never
been
inhabited
no
flag
had
ever
been
raised
above
its
benches
of
dazzling
coral
sand
at
that
time
as
for
centuries
before
the
sea
birds
nested
undisturbed
on
the
islets
within
the
reef
where
all
day
long
the
water
flashed
blue
in
the
sunlight
and
the
trade
wind
hummed
a
song
of
loneliness
among
the
palm
tops
then
a
day
came
when
two
traders
and
planters
of
coconuts
in
the
of
ariri
here
was
an
island
capable
of
an
annual
hundred
tons
of
copra
and
claimed
by
no
man
they
would
plant
it
and
reap
the
rewards
of
enterprise
the
chief
difficulty
was
to
find
a
superintendent
to
take
charge
of
the
project
it
needed
a
white
man
but
white
men
willing
to
undertake
a
task
of
such
poignant
loneliness
were
not
to
be
found
every
day
in
papeete
as
it
chanced
their
man
was
at
hand
the
natives
called
him
his
name
had
once
been
king
years
among
the
islands
had
obliterated
whatever
stamp
of
nationality
he
might
have
possessed
it
was
rumored
that
he
was
english
by
birth
and
also
that
he
had
held
a
commission
in
the
confederate
navy
tall
strong
and
of
fine
presence
with
a
full
blond
beard
and
eyes
of
reckless
blue
a
great
singer
and
the
merriest
at
a
feast
and
the
idol
of
the
women
a
remarkable
linguist
and
drunken
brave
witty
and
was
of
a
type
which
thrives
in
polynesia
when
they
offered
him
the
position
of
superintendent
at
ariri
the
two
frenchmen
were
not
without
misgivings
he
was
on
the
beach
at
the
time
though
the
only
sign
of
that
condition
was
an
unusual
laxity
in
returning
the
favor
when
a
friend
invited
him
to
drink
tino
had
no
money
but
that
was
his
sole
limitation
each
of
a
dozen
native
families
vied
for
the
honor
of
transferring
his
mat
and
camphorwood
box
to
their
house
when
evening
came
he
had
his
choice
of
a
dozen
invitations
to
dine
and
a
dozen
girls
competed
for
the
joy
of
doing
his
laundry
and
making
hats
for
him
but
this
philosophy
and
lack
of
worry
over
a
situation
scarcely
respectable
in
the
eyes
of
papeete
s
business
men
were
calculated
to
sow
distrust
in
the
case
of
ariri
however
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
he
could
go
astray
there
would
be
no
would
see
to
with
no
visitors
and
no
means
of
leaving
the
island
there
seemed
little
chance
of
trouble
tino
was
a
famous
handler
of
native
labor
the
agreement
was
made
and
in
due
time
a
schooner
sailed
into
the
ariri
lagoon
to
land
tino
and
a
score
of
raiatea
boys
with
their
wives
the
frenchmen
took
care
to
leave
no
boat
capable
of
putting
out
to
sea
but
as
there
were
houses
and
sheds
to
build
they
left
a
considerable
variety
of
tools
and
gear
in
addition
to
a
year
s
supply
of
medicine
food
and
clothing
a
day
or
two
later
the
schooner
sailed
away
the
superintendent
called
his
men
together
and
appointed
a
foreman
the
main
island
was
to
be
cleared
rows
staked
out
and
the
nuts
brought
for
seed
to
be
planted
in
such
a
manner
before
this
work
began
a
house
was
to
be
built
for
each
family
that
was
all
except
that
tino
needed
five
men
at
once
for
special
work
of
his
them
be
those
most
skilled
in
woodworking
with
that
he
seems
to
have
dismissed
the
business
of
planting
coconuts
from
his
mind
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
hibiscus
on
the
island
as
well
as
the
trees
called
and
in
seven
months
time
with
the
help
of
his
men
tino
cut
down
trees
sawed
out
timbers
and
planking
and
built
a
fast
and
seaworthy
her
mast
was
the
trunk
of
an
old
coconut
palm
her
sails
a
patchwork
of
varied
fabrics
her
cordage
of
cinnet
twisted
and
braided
coconut
work
of
women
incredibly
skillful
and
patient
for
anchor
she
carried
a
grooved
coral
bowlder
and
her
water
tanks
were
kerosene
tins
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
month
this
improbable
vessel
was
launched
rigged
and
provisioned
tino
bade
his
men
farewell
and
set
to
the
westward
fearless
and
alone
his
only
instrument
was
a
compass
and
yet
he
made
the
passage
to
hundred
fifteen
days
i
forgot
to
say
that
before
his
departure
he
had
ordered
the
top
of
a
tall
palm
chopped
off
and
on
this
stout
flagpole
had
hoisted
a
homemade
edition
of
the
union
jack
in
fiji
he
wasted
no
time
at
the
office
of
the
high
commissioner
of
the
pacific
he
announced
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
ariri
in
the
name
of
the
british
empire
and
petitioned
that
a
fifty
years
lease
of
the
nominal
given
him
the
request
was
granted
a
few
days
later
tino
was
again
at
sea
still
alone
and
headed
for
his
little
kingdom
the
story
is
that
he
bought
a
sextant
in
fiji
but
at
any
rate
something
went
wrong
and
he
was
fifty
days
without
a
landfall
think
of
this
extraordinary
man
drifting
about
alone
in
his
absurd
and
unworried
even
captain
slocum
said
to
have
navigated
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
with
no
other
chronometer
than
a
connecticut
alarm
clock
performed
no
madder
feat
tino
fetched
up
at
a
big
lagoon
island
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
out
of
his
course
it
is
enough
to
say
of
his
stop
there
that
he
spent
a
week
and
left
loaded
down
with
provisions
and
drinking
nuts
and
accompanied
by
five
of
the
younger
and
prettier
girls
of
the
village
this
time
all
went
smoothly
the
plural
honeymoon
party
enjoyed
a
merry
voyage
to
ariri
where
tino
established
his
large
and
amicable
family
and
proceeded
to
the
less
diverting
business
of
planting
coconuts
a
year
passed
a
day
came
when
the
schooner
from
tahiti
rounded
to
in
the
lagoon
and
sent
a
boat
ashore
accompanied
by
his
twenty
men
tino
met
the
supercargo
on
the
beach
copra
from
the
old
trees
there
was
not
much
but
what
there
was
belonged
to
him
this
was
a
british
island
and
he
was
the
lessee
here
were
the
papers
to
prove
it
he
regretted
that
as
the
proprietor
he
could
not
allow
strangers
the
labor
you
know
the
frenchmen
fumed
but
they
were
too
shrewd
not
to
recognize
defeat
the
years
passed
in
peaceful
and
idyllic
fashion
a
score
of
tino
s
offspring
fished
and
swam
and
raced
along
the
beach
then
one
day
tino
fell
ill
while
he
lay
in
bed
despondent
and
brooding
over
the
unfamiliar
experience
a
schooner
entered
the
lagoon
and
dropped
anchor
opposite
the
settlement
her
and
smartly
manned
as
a
yacht
s
ashore
the
first
missionary
to
set
foot
on
ariri
tino
was
difficult
in
the
beginning
but
the
moment
was
perhaps
the
weakest
of
his
life
when
the
missionary
left
he
had
married
the
sick
man
to
favorite
received
permission
to
install
a
native
teacher
for
the
children
of
the
island
it
amuses
me
to
think
of
tino
s
recovery
and
probable
regret
over
his
thing
is
so
natural
so
human
bodily
illness
and
spiritual
reform
have
always
gone
hand
in
hand
but
his
word
had
been
given
in
good
faith
he
finished
the
church
and
schoolhouse
he
had
promised
and
in
due
time
installed
the
teacher
among
his
flock
the
supreme
irony
of
the
affair
comes
at
this
point
for
the
native
teacher
on
the
lookout
for
a
flirtation
was
indiscreet
enough
to
select
manini
as
the
object
of
his
attentions
and
ended
by
being
caught
with
her
under
circumstances
of
the
most
delicate
and
compromising
nature
as
tino
said
afterward
he
had
a
score
of
women
to
choose
from
beside
four
of
mine
who
wouldn
t
have
then
he
picked
on
manini
why
damn
it
all
man
i
was
a
bit
fond
of
the
old
girl
the
teacher
paid
dearly
for
his
indiscretion
tino
lashed
him
to
a
post
in
the
sun
where
he
would
probably
have
died
if
the
missionary
schooner
had
not
appeared
just
at
that
time
cowed
and
whimpering
the
culprit
was
thrown
into
a
canoe
by
the
indignant
husband
who
pushed
off
and
paddled
angrily
alongside
the
schooner
here
s
your
bleeding
missionary
he
roared
out
as
he
hurled
the
struggling
native
into
the
lagoon
i
m
through
with
now
on
this
island
will
have
to
get
along
with
me
for
teacher
and
missionary
and
king
that
is
all
of
the
story
except
that
tino
died
not
long
rich
enough
and
surrounded
by
a
numerous
tribe
of
grandchildren
the
house
of
you
will
not
find
ahu
that
any
chart
and
it
would
be
equally
useless
to
search
for
nukutere
yet
both
islands
exist
and
i
like
their
ancient
names
better
than
the
modern
ones
glance
at
your
maps
and
you
will
see
the
eastern
pacific
dotted
with
islands
bearing
names
like
jarvis
maiden
and
which
suggest
no
more
than
the
thought
of
some
wandering
skipper
immortalizing
himself
by
adding
new
dangers
to
the
chart
then
think
of
immemorial
name
of
an
island
known
wherever
the
old
polynesians
gathered
to
tell
their
tales
nukutere
the
object
of
the
war
fleet
s
voyage
it
needs
a
dull
imagination
not
to
feel
a
stir
it
was
on
nukutere
that
i
found
that
curious
fellow
tari
at
home
friends
often
smile
at
my
passion
for
wild
fowl
yet
i
owe
this
peaceful
adventure
entirely
to
a
duck
for
several
days
i
had
been
awaiting
a
chance
to
photograph
the
sky
line
of
the
island
and
when
one
afternoon
the
clouds
about
the
peaks
dispersed
i
put
my
camera
into
a
small
outrigger
canoe
and
paddled
down
the
lagoon
on
the
lookout
for
the
viewpoint
of
greatest
beauty
i
had
gone
a
number
of
miles
and
the
sun
was
low
when
i
found
the
view
i
wanted
though
the
silhouette
of
nukutere
was
there
were
clouds
in
the
west
and
the
light
was
not
strong
enough
for
an
instantaneous
picture
the
lagoon
is
narrow
at
this
point
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
paddle
out
to
the
reef
and
set
up
my
tripod
in
the
shallow
wash
of
the
sea
in
this
manner
i
made
ten
things
they
must
have
been
with
the
long
evening
shadows
the
foreshore
of
dark
bush
beyond
the
water
the
high
profile
of
peaks
and
jagged
ridges
against
the
sky
i
folded
the
steel
tripod
and
stowed
the
camera
in
its
case
just
as
i
pushed
off
to
paddle
back
to
the
village
i
heard
the
whimper
of
a
duck
s
wings
in
leisurely
flight
i
have
a
very
fair
acquaintance
with
the
ducks
of
the
northern
hemisphere
which
winter
in
considerable
numbers
in
hawaii
and
occasionally
drift
down
as
far
as
penrhyn
island
nine
degrees
south
of
the
equator
but
though
it
must
be
well
known
in
scientific
quarters
the
odd
nonmigratory
duck
of
the
south
seas
is
a
puzzle
to
me
it
is
an
unsocial
bird
this
polynesian
cousin
of
the
mallard
a
lover
of
solitude
a
haunter
of
thick
woods
and
lonely
valleys
though
i
have
seen
them
many
times
in
the
distance
i
have
been
unable
to
obtain
a
specimen
so
far
i
used
to
wonder
how
they
survived
the
swarms
of
bloodthirsty
island
rats
until
a
friend
wrote
me
from
the
cook
group
on
top
of
the
ridge
behind
the
plantation
the
dogs
put
up
a
duck
almost
under
our
feet
i
found
the
nest
well
hidden
in
the
fern
a
beautifully
constructed
affair
edged
with
a
coaming
of
down
curled
inward
there
were
eight
eggs
standing
on
end
and
arranged
to
occupy
the
least
possible
space
when
the
ducklings
appear
the
old
bird
must
carry
them
down
one
at
a
thousand
feet
or
the
swampy
feeding
grounds
i
could
tell
by
the
sound
of
its
wings
that
the
duck
approaching
me
over
the
lagoon
was
closer
than
any
i
had
seen
in
my
eagerness
for
a
glimpse
i
forgot
all
about
cameras
and
canoes
i
flung
myself
around
to
look
intent
and
next
moment
the
outrigger
heaved
up
with
the
speed
of
a
rolling
porpoise
described
a
flashing
arc
through
the
air
and
smacked
heavily
into
the
water
closing
over
my
head
it
was
a
fast
bit
of
comedy
the
coral
anchor
and
my
tripod
went
to
the
bottom
i
caught
the
camera
instinctively
and
rose
sputtering
to
the
surface
where
i
managed
to
balance
it
on
the
flat
bottom
of
the
canoe
then
as
the
water
was
not
deep
and
i
had
on
nothing
but
a
singlet
and
a
i
swam
down
to
get
the
tripod
and
started
for
shore
pushing
the
canoe
before
me
ahead
on
the
beach
two
girls
and
a
boy
were
dancing
and
rolling
in
the
sand
as
the
water
left
my
ears
i
could
hear
their
screams
of
joy
for
the
moment
i
found
myself
unable
to
join
in
the
mirth
my
thoughts
dwelt
on
cameras
and
on
a
story
i
had
heard
the
night
a
fisherman
not
far
from
where
i
was
had
felt
a
tug
at
his
waist
as
he
swam
with
face
submerged
watching
the
bottom
and
turned
to
see
a
shark
of
imposing
size
nip
off
the
largest
fish
on
his
string
the
closer
sight
of
me
seemed
to
redouble
the
appreciation
of
my
audience
but
it
was
not
until
i
was
splashing
in
the
shallows
that
i
was
able
to
smile
then
i
saw
that
the
elder
of
the
girls
was
apakura
the
wife
of
tari
she
had
been
washing
clothes
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
stream
and
came
forward
and
smiling
maliciously
to
greet
me
ah
you
have
come
to
bathe
in
the
sea
she
said
as
i
took
her
hand
and
at
this
enormous
joke
all
three
fell
into
such
a
convulsion
of
laughter
that
they
were
obliged
to
sink
down
on
the
sand
once
more
when
she
had
caught
her
breath
she
turned
to
call
her
husband
tari
e
tari
e
aere
mai
ikonei
a
moment
later
he
stepped
out
of
the
bush
rubbing
from
his
eyes
the
sleep
of
an
afternoon
nap
and
i
was
shaking
his
hand
i
know
tari
rather
well
and
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
within
a
few
miles
of
where
he
lives
yet
i
had
been
in
his
house
only
once
before
this
is
characteristic
of
the
islands
there
is
an
agreeable
indifference
about
the
relations
of
white
men
down
here
a
careless
friendliness
i
find
pleasanter
than
the
more
strained
and
effusive
sociality
of
civilized
places
in
every
part
of
the
world
of
course
this
tranquil
essence
of
the
finest
to
be
found
among
the
few
who
have
studied
the
art
of
living
but
the
average
one
of
us
is
neither
sure
enough
of
himself
nor
sufficiently
indifferent
to
the
opinion
of
others
handicapped
by
an
abnormal
sense
of
obligation
we
permit
ourselves
both
to
bore
and
to
be
bored
in
certain
respects
the
native
is
a
very
man
perhaps
the
white
intruder
has
caught
something
of
his
it
may
be
that
distance
from
home
brings
life
into
a
truer
focus
in
any
case
one
deals
with
the
white
man
of
the
islands
without
consciousness
of
an
effort
either
to
entertain
or
to
impress
when
you
stop
at
the
house
of
a
strange
planter
he
will
offer
you
a
you
refuse
nothing
more
will
be
said
of
the
matter
at
home
with
a
parching
throat
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
you
might
tell
your
chance
host
not
to
bother
looking
forward
with
hopeful
hypocrisy
to
his
persuasion
and
your
own
inevitable
acceptance
i
think
i
liked
tari
the
better
for
not
having
asked
me
to
his
house
now
that
hazard
had
brought
me
to
the
door
he
made
me
feel
that
i
was
really
welcome
the
house
was
set
on
a
little
rise
of
land
with
a
view
of
the
lagoon
at
the
end
of
an
avenue
of
tall
coconut
palms
the
broad
veranda
set
with
steamer
chairs
and
aitutaki
mats
gave
on
a
garden
of
small
flowering
frangipani
maid
of
moorea
queen
of
the
night
tari
showed
me
to
a
corner
room
and
mixed
a
rum
punch
while
his
wife
put
buttons
on
a
fresh
suit
of
drill
dressed
in
his
clothes
i
strolled
into
the
living
room
to
wait
while
he
was
changing
for
dinner
the
place
was
large
and
one
might
have
spent
hours
examining
the
things
it
fruit
of
twenty
years
in
the
south
seas
there
were
wreaths
of
favorite
parting
gift
of
the
the
paumotus
from
raiatea
from
aitutaki
and
mangaias
there
were
fans
from
manihiki
woven
in
patterns
of
dyed
pandanus
and
savage
island
fans
decorated
with
human
hair
ranged
on
a
series
of
shelves
i
found
a
notable
collection
of
of
eastern
polynesia
implements
in
which
the
culture
of
each
group
expresses
itself
i
was
able
to
recognize
the
pestle
of
mangaia
and
carved
with
almost
geometrical
perfection
from
a
stalactite
of
pink
lime
the
marquesan
of
dark
volcanic
stone
with
its
curious
phallic
handle
the
implement
of
old
tahiti
gracefully
designed
and
smoothly
finished
by
a
people
far
removed
from
savagery
the
rare
and
beautiful
of
as
though
turned
on
a
lathe
and
adorned
with
a
fantastic
handle
of
ancient
and
forgotten
significance
bonito
hooks
from
a
dozen
groups
were
there
and
on
a
table
i
saw
a
rare
from
mangaia
an
odd
thing
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
might
be
called
a
peace
adze
it
is
a
slender
little
tower
of
carved
wood
set
with
tiers
of
windows
and
surmounted
by
a
stone
adze
head
lashed
on
with
wrappings
of
sennit
above
which
extend
a
pair
of
pointed
ears
the
the
yellow
wood
of
the
exquisitely
done
i
recognized
the
standard
patterns
of
the
shark
s
teeth
the
dropping
water
and
the
intricate
the
significance
of
the
peace
adze
was
religious
and
ceremonial
the
story
goes
that
when
at
the
end
of
a
period
of
fighting
two
mangaian
clans
decided
to
make
peace
the
adze
played
a
leading
part
in
the
attendant
ceremony
a
handful
of
earth
was
dug
up
with
its
head
to
show
that
the
ground
might
now
be
cultivated
and
the
people
were
told
that
they
might
come
and
go
unmolested
freely
as
the
air
through
the
windowlike
openings
on
its
sides
tari
had
real
adzes
as
tools
with
which
trees
were
chopped
down
and
canoes
hollowed
implements
of
a
perfection
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
carved
out
of
basaltic
rock
hard
and
close
as
steel
smoothed
by
processes
at
which
one
can
only
guess
sharp
and
symmetrical
as
the
product
of
modern
machines
the
marquesan
curiosities
interested
me
most
of
of
those
dark
valleys
which
harbored
the
most
strangely
fascinating
of
all
the
island
peoples
there
were
ornaments
of
old
men
s
beards
arranged
in
little
tufts
crinkled
and
yellowish
white
beaked
clubs
of
ironwood
elegantly
carved
and
smooth
with
countless
oilings
ear
pendants
cut
in
delicate
filigree
from
the
teeth
of
sperm
whales
grotesque
little
wooden
gods
monstrous
and
bizarre
ceremonial
food
bowls
of
adorned
with
the
rich
and
graceful
designs
of
a
culture
now
forever
gone
one
felt
that
the
spirits
of
forgotten
artists
hovered
about
the
place
beckoning
one
back
to
days
a
century
before
melville
set
foot
in
the
valley
of
taipi
to
scenes
of
a
strange
beauty
on
which
mankind
will
never
look
again
some
in
a
future
less
remote
than
we
like
to
s
careless
hand
may
once
more
set
the
stage
for
a
similar
experiment
but
the
people
sequestered
in
those
gloomy
islands
will
be
of
another
blood
and
the
result
can
never
be
the
same
the
marquesans
one
is
to
believe
the
students
of
antique
the
result
of
a
racial
retrogression
their
continental
forebears
knew
iron
and
pottery
and
the
culture
of
lost
in
the
eastward
push
which
brought
them
to
the
nine
islands
of
iva
one
curious
fatu
hiva
my
eye
a
squat
little
figure
carved
in
a
length
of
yellow
ivory
i
examined
it
closely
it
had
the
air
of
being
at
least
a
hundred
years
old
and
the
concentric
rings
of
the
section
showed
it
to
be
the
tooth
or
tusk
of
some
large
animal
where
could
the
marquesan
carver
have
obtained
such
a
lump
of
ivory
on
which
to
exercise
his
skill
could
it
be
possible
that
this
was
the
tusk
of
an
elephant
carved
not
one
hundred
but
many
centuries
ago
and
preserved
by
the
people
of
these
distant
immemorial
relic
of
the
days
when
their
ancestors
left
persia
or
the
indian
hills
i
looked
again
it
was
large
enough
to
be
part
of
a
small
tusk
but
the
section
was
flatter
than
any
elephant
ivory
i
had
seen
what
could
it
be
not
the
tooth
of
a
was
too
large
for
that
not
the
sword
of
a
narwhal
which
shows
a
betraying
spiral
twist
then
i
thought
of
a
walrus
tusk
and
the
story
seemed
clear
or
a
hundred
years
ago
some
whaling
vessel
after
a
venture
in
the
northern
ice
must
have
sailed
south
and
put
in
at
fatu
hiva
for
water
or
wood
or
fruit
they
had
killed
walrus
off
cape
lisburne
or
in
the
kotzebue
sound
and
as
was
the
habit
of
whalers
some
of
the
tusks
had
been
kept
for
scrimshaw
work
knowing
the
polynesian
passion
for
ivory
in
tonga
it
was
death
for
any
but
those
of
the
highest
rank
to
take
the
teeth
of
a
stranded
sperm
whale
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
the
yankee
harpooner
perhaps
trading
his
walrus
tusk
for
a
canoeload
of
fruit
or
the
favors
of
an
exceptionally
pretty
girl
i
was
examining
a
paddle
from
graceful
thing
carved
out
of
porcupine
wood
and
set
with
diamonds
of
tari
came
in
a
pretty
paddle
isn
t
it
he
remarked
you
won
t
find
a
more
curious
one
in
the
pacific
notice
the
way
that
reinforcing
ridge
runs
down
the
blade
from
the
haft
everything
has
a
meaning
in
primitive
stuff
of
this
sort
the
original
pattern
from
which
this
has
descended
probably
came
from
a
land
of
little
trees
where
the
paddles
had
to
be
made
in
two
lashed
to
handle
look
at
the
shape
of
like
a
zulu
than
anything
else
it
is
a
weapon
primarily
a
thrust
of
it
would
kill
a
naked
man
the
manihiki
people
spend
a
lot
of
their
time
in
canoes
on
the
open
bonito
by
day
and
by
those
waters
swarm
with
sharks
they
have
developed
their
paddle
into
a
weapon
of
defence
the
samoans
carried
a
special
shark
club
for
the
same
purpose
i
asked
his
opinion
on
the
disputed
question
of
in
general
the
shark
is
a
real
menace
to
the
swimmer
or
the
paddler
of
a
small
canoe
i
ve
heard
a
lot
of
loose
talk
he
said
how
learned
societies
have
offered
rewards
for
a
genuine
instance
of
a
shark
attacking
a
man
but
i
have
seen
enough
to
know
that
there
is
no
room
for
argument
some
idiot
goes
swimming
off
a
vessel
in
waters
and
talks
all
the
rest
of
his
life
perhaps
of
the
silly
fears
of
realizing
that
he
owes
his
life
to
the
fact
that
none
of
the
sharks
about
him
chanced
to
be
more
than
usually
hungry
the
really
hungry
shark
is
a
ravening
as
a
wounded
buffalo
reckless
as
a
mad
dog
i
have
seen
one
tear
the
paddle
from
the
hand
of
a
man
beside
me
and
sink
its
teeth
over
and
over
again
in
a
frenzy
in
the
bottom
of
a
heavy
canoe
how
long
do
you
suppose
a
swimmer
would
have
lived
and
it
s
not
only
the
big
sharks
that
are
dangerous
i
remember
one
day
when
a
lot
of
us
were
bathing
in
penrhyn
lagoon
suddenly
one
of
the
boys
gave
a
shout
and
began
to
struggle
with
something
in
the
with
blood
by
the
time
i
got
there
a
small
tiger
shark
scarcely
a
yard
long
had
gouged
a
piece
of
flesh
out
of
his
leg
and
continued
to
attack
until
a
big
kanaka
seized
it
by
the
tail
and
waded
to
the
beach
holding
the
devilish
little
brute
snapping
its
jaws
and
writhing
frantically
at
arm
s
length
as
he
reached
the
dry
sand
the
native
allowed
his
arm
to
relax
for
an
instant
the
shark
set
its
teeth
in
his
side
and
tore
out
a
mouthful
that
nearly
cost
the
man
his
life
the
voice
of
apakura
was
summoning
us
to
eat
she
called
mai
korua
tari
s
dining
room
was
a
section
of
the
side
veranda
screened
off
with
lattices
of
bamboo
where
we
found
a
table
set
for
two
fresh
with
flowers
and
damask
apakura
sat
on
a
mat
near
by
she
was
weaving
a
hat
of
native
grass
and
looked
up
from
her
work
now
and
then
to
speak
to
the
girl
who
served
scolding
and
joking
in
turn
tari
followed
my
glance
and
smiled
as
he
caught
the
eye
of
his
wife
it
probably
strikes
you
as
odd
that
she
doesn
t
sit
with
us
he
said
to
me
i
tried
to
get
her
into
the
way
of
it
at
first
but
it
s
no
good
for
generations
the
women
of
her
family
have
been
forbidden
to
eat
in
the
presence
of
men
and
the
old
dies
hard
then
she
hates
chairs
when
she
sits
with
me
she
is
wretchedly
uncomfortable
and
bolts
her
food
in
a
scared
kind
of
way
that
puts
me
off
my
feed
it
is
best
to
let
them
follow
their
own
customs
she
likes
to
sit
on
the
floor
there
and
order
her
cousin
about
when
we
ve
finished
they
ll
adjourn
to
the
cook
house
for
dinner
and
discuss
you
till
your
ears
tingle
housekeeping
down
here
is
a
funny
haphazard
if
one
demands
what
one
had
at
home
easy
and
pleasant
if
one
is
willing
to
compromise
a
bit
to
a
man
who
understands
the
natives
at
all
the
servant
question
does
not
exist
they
will
jump
at
a
chance
to
attach
themselves
to
your
trouble
is
to
keep
them
away
it
isn
t
wages
they
are
after
i
pay
these
people
nothing
at
all
for
cooking
and
washing
and
looking
after
the
place
they
like
to
be
where
tea
and
sugar
and
ship
s
biscuit
are
in
plenty
and
they
like
to
be
amused
an
occasional
stranger
coming
and
going
like
yourself
gives
them
no
end
of
food
for
talk
i
have
a
phonograph
i
let
them
play
and
a
seine
i
let
them
take
out
for
a
day
s
fishing
now
and
then
once
a
month
perhaps
i
kill
a
pig
and
give
a
bit
of
a
party
and
once
or
twice
in
a
year
i
get
a
bullock
and
let
them
invite
all
their
relatives
to
a
real
in
return
for
all
this
they
look
after
my
fifty
acres
of
coconuts
make
my
copra
do
my
housework
cooking
and
laundry
and
provide
me
with
all
the
native
food
i
can
use
it
strikes
me
as
a
fair
bargain
from
my
point
of
view
at
least
it
is
understood
that
they
are
not
to
bother
me
unless
there
is
work
to
do
or
they
want
to
see
me
they
never
set
foot
in
the
house
my
greatest
trouble
has
been
to
get
some
idea
of
regularity
into
their
heads
these
people
can
not
understand
why
we
prefer
to
eat
our
dinner
at
the
same
hour
every
day
where
contact
with
the
white
man
has
not
changed
their
habits
they
eat
whenever
they
are
midnight
or
at
four
in
the
morning
if
they
chance
to
be
awake
even
here
they
can
t
understand
my
feelings
when
dinner
is
an
hour
or
two
late
the
cousin
of
apakura
took
away
the
remnants
of
a
dish
of
raw
fish
and
brought
us
a
platter
heaped
with
roast
breadfruit
taro
yams
and
sweet
potatoes
served
with
a
pitcher
of
sea
water
and
coconut
sauce
worthy
of
a
place
on
any
table
it
is
only
the
uncivilized
white
who
turns
up
his
nose
at
native
food
the
island
s
vegetables
are
both
wholesome
and
delicious
and
can
not
be
cooked
better
than
in
a
maori
oven
a
certain
amount
of
european
food
is
necessary
to
health
but
the
sallow
provincial
white
man
who
takes
a
sort
of
racial
pride
in
living
on
the
contents
of
tins
need
not
be
surprised
that
the
climate
of
the
islands
does
not
agree
with
him
it
is
the
same
type
usually
with
no
other
cause
for
pride
than
the
fact
that
he
chanced
to
be
born
white
whose
voice
is
most
frequently
heard
declaiming
on
the
subject
of
color
everywhere
in
the
islands
of
course
the
color
line
subtle
barrier
between
the
races
not
to
be
crossed
with
impunity
but
the
better
sort
of
white
man
is
ready
to
admit
that
god
who
presumably
made
him
also
made
the
native
and
made
of
the
polynesian
a
rather
fine
piece
of
work
tari
had
stepped
across
with
eyes
open
counting
the
cost
realizing
all
that
he
must
relinquish
he
is
not
a
man
to
make
such
a
decision
lightly
in
his
case
the
step
meant
severing
the
last
material
tie
with
home
giving
up
forever
the
englishman
s
dreams
of
white
children
and
an
old
age
in
the
pleasant
english
countryside
his
children
came
to
have
skins
tinted
by
a
hundred
generations
of
hot
sunlight
and
look
at
him
with
strange
dark
eyes
liquid
and
eyes
of
an
elder
race
begotten
when
the
world
was
young
his
old
age
would
be
spent
on
this
remote
and
forgotten
bit
of
land
immensely
isolated
from
the
ancestral
background
to
which
most
men
return
at
last
as
the
shadows
gathered
in
the
evening
of
his
life
there
would
be
long
days
of
reading
and
in
a
steamer
chair
on
this
same
veranda
while
the
trade
hummed
through
the
palm
tops
and
the
sea
rumbled
softly
on
the
reef
at
night
lying
wakeful
as
old
men
do
in
a
hush
broken
only
by
the
murmur
of
a
lonely
sea
his
thoughts
would
wander
little
sadly
as
the
thoughts
of
an
old
man
a
hundred
winding
paths
of
memory
through
scenes
wild
and
lovely
savage
stern
and
gay
dimly
out
of
the
past
would
appear
the
faces
of
men
and
since
dead
and
already
only
vaguely
companions
of
his
youth
once
individually
vibrant
with
the
current
of
life
now
moldering
alike
in
forgotten
graves
they
would
be
a
strangely
assorted
company
tari
s
ghosts
men
of
all
the
races
scholars
soldiers
sportsmen
skippers
of
trading
vessels
pearl
divers
of
the
atolls
nurses
of
the
red
cross
englishwomen
of
his
own
station
in
life
daughters
of
the
islands
with
shining
hair
and
the
beauty
of
sleek
wild
and
soulless
half
bold
and
half
afraid
whether
for
good
or
ill
wisely
or
unwisely
as
the
case
might
be
no
man
could
say
that
tari
had
not
lived
i
wondered
what
the
verdict
would
be
when
in
the
days
to
come
he
cast
up
the
balance
of
his
life
apakura
ceased
her
plaiting
and
began
to
measure
off
the
narrow
braid
delicately
woven
in
a
pattern
of
black
and
white
which
would
eventually
be
sewn
in
spirals
to
make
a
hat
by
the
way
for
it
had
been
promised
to
me
weeks
before
one
fathom
two
fathoms
three
two
fathoms
were
needed
work
for
the
odd
moments
of
a
month
some
an
uncertain
future
and
on
a
distant
island
cabin
boy
of
a
schooner
would
step
ashore
and
present
me
with
a
box
containing
this
same
hat
superbly
new
decorated
with
a
gay
puggree
and
lined
with
satin
bearing
my
initials
in
silk
meanwhile
though
i
would
have
given
much
for
a
new
hat
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
like
other
things
of
native
make
a
hat
can
not
be
bought
with
money
the
process
of
manufacture
is
too
laborious
to
be
other
than
a
matter
of
good
will
think
of
the
work
that
goes
into
one
of
these
hats
first
of
off
in
the
stalks
of
must
be
gathered
these
are
split
when
thoroughly
dry
and
the
two
halves
scraped
thin
as
paper
before
being
split
again
into
tiny
strips
of
fiber
less
than
a
sixteenth
of
an
inch
wide
a
certain
amount
of
the
depending
on
the
pattern
to
be
woven
must
now
be
black
or
in
a
shade
of
brown
from
a
dozen
to
twenty
of
these
and
plaited
into
the
flexible
braid
of
which
the
hat
is
built
task
requiring
extraordinary
patience
and
skill
such
hats
are
made
only
for
relatives
and
close
friends
if
an
unmarried
girl
gives
one
to
a
man
the
gift
has
the
same
significance
as
the
pair
of
earrings
he
would
give
in
return
when
a
native
boy
appears
with
a
new
and
gorgeous
hat
the
origin
of
which
is
veiled
in
doubt
village
gossip
hums
until
the
truth
is
known
even
the
classic
sewing
circle
of
new
england
can
show
no
faster
or
more
efficient
work
than
these
artless
brown
women
standing
knee
deep
in
the
waters
of
some
dashing
stream
prattling
laughing
shattering
the
reputations
of
absent
sisters
as
they
pound
and
wring
the
soapy
clothes
when
dinner
was
over
and
tari
was
filling
his
pipe
in
the
living
room
i
took
up
the
lamp
for
a
glance
at
the
titles
on
his
shelves
of
books
side
by
side
with
the
transactions
of
the
polynesian
society
and
the
modern
works
of
percy
smith
and
mcmillan
brown
i
found
mariner
s
abraham
fornander
s
of
the
polynesian
race
its
origin
and
lieut
william
bligh
s
to
the
south
seas
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
the
tree
to
the
west
indies
in
his
majesty
s
ship
bounty
and
the
of
william
ellis
i
took
down
a
volume
of
ellis
tari
crossed
the
room
to
glance
over
my
shoulder
at
the
quaint
title
was
evident
that
he
loved
his
books
tahiti
was
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
islands
he
said
as
we
sat
down
and
the
best
accounts
of
old
tahiti
are
those
of
bligh
and
ellis
bligh
wrote
from
the
standpoint
of
a
worldly
man
and
though
he
was
unable
to
speak
the
language
fluently
and
stopped
only
a
few
months
on
the
island
he
has
left
an
extraordinarily
vivid
and
detailed
picture
of
the
native
life
before
european
religion
and
trade
began
their
work
of
change
ellis
was
a
missionary
of
the
finest
as
religious
men
go
inspired
by
the
purest
of
motives
a
close
and
sympathetic
observer
and
able
to
appreciate
much
of
the
beauty
and
interest
of
the
old
life
if
you
believe
that
one
branch
of
mankind
is
justified
in
almost
forcibly
spreading
its
religion
among
the
other
races
and
that
trade
should
follow
the
bible
you
will
enjoy
every
page
of
ellis
his
point
of
view
concerning
temporal
matters
is
summed
up
in
this
volume
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
on
hawaii
here
it
is
their
intercourse
with
foreigners
has
taught
many
of
the
chiefs
to
prefer
a
bedstead
to
the
ground
and
a
mattress
to
a
mat
to
sit
on
a
chair
eat
at
a
table
use
a
knife
and
fork
etc
this
we
think
advantageous
not
only
to
those
who
visit
them
for
purposes
of
commerce
but
to
the
natives
themselves
as
it
increases
their
wants
and
consequently
stimulates
to
there
you
hear
the
voice
of
the
mechanical
age
which
began
a
hundred
years
ago
and
rather
we
fired
the
last
shots
of
the
war
increase
their
wants
advertise
speed
up
the
impalpable
cost
make
the
way
smooth
for
the
swift
wheels
of
are
the
germs
of
a
disease
from
which
the
world
may
need
another
century
to
recover
but
the
change
in
these
islands
was
only
the
insignificant
corollary
of
a
greater
change
throughout
the
world
ellis
and
his
kind
were
no
more
than
the
inevitable
instruments
of
a
harsh
providence
ellis
s
book
was
published
in
eighteen
during
the
years
that
have
passed
since
that
date
we
have
seized
the
islands
and
profited
largely
by
coaling
stations
as
naval
bases
as
sources
of
valuable
raw
material
as
markets
for
our
surplus
manufactured
goods
what
have
we
done
for
the
natives
in
return
instead
of
the
industrious
piously
happy
and
increasing
communities
foreseen
by
the
missionaries
as
the
result
of
their
efforts
one
finds
a
depressed
and
dying
people
robbed
of
their
old
beliefs
and
secretly
skeptical
of
the
new
we
who
conduct
our
wars
in
so
humane
and
chivalrous
a
spirit
have
taught
them
to
abolish
human
sacrifice
and
to
stop
the
savage
fighting
which
horrified
the
first
messengers
of
christianity
but
in
the
case
of
the
islands
of
which
ellis
wrote
the
benefits
of
civilization
end
here
infanticide
is
now
a
punishable
crime
and
rarely
practiced
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
have
children
and
to
kill
a
certain
number
of
them
as
to
be
rendered
sterile
by
imported
disease
after
all
infanticide
repulsive
though
it
may
be
is
only
a
primitive
form
of
the
birth
control
which
is
making
its
appearance
in
europe
and
america
as
the
white
man
s
the
limit
of
population
as
for
true
religious
faith
of
the
kind
which
the
missionaries
sincerely
hoped
to
instill
that
plays
in
the
life
of
the
kanaka
a
part
of
about
the
same
importance
as
in
the
life
of
the
average
white
man
don
t
think
i
am
cynical
in
saying
respect
and
envy
men
who
possess
real
faith
they
are
the
ones
by
whom
every
great
task
is
accomplished
but
the
religion
of
the
native
is
less
than
skin
deep
his
observance
of
the
sabbath
day
a
survival
of
the
old
his
churchgoing
and
singing
of
the
social
instinct
the
love
of
gossip
the
desire
to
be
seen
in
fine
the
dance
wrestling
matches
and
exhibitions
of
the
you
have
seen
something
of
the
outer
islands
where
the
people
are
half
savage
even
still
swayed
by
what
we
call
heathen
superstition
now
consider
tahiti
where
the
people
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
have
been
subjected
to
exhortations
of
an
intensity
almost
unparalleled
if
it
is
possible
to
inject
our
religion
into
their
blood
it
must
have
been
accomplished
in
tahiti
but
in
my
opinion
the
efforts
of
three
generations
of
missionaries
have
produced
a
result
surprisingly
small
on
this
most
civilized
of
the
south
heathen
superstition
is
far
from
dead
before
the
schooners
took
to
penrhyn
lagoon
we
used
to
spend
the
hurricane
season
in
papeete
i
never
cared
much
for
towns
i
usually
put
in
the
time
wandering
about
the
more
remote
districts
civilization
has
barely
scratched
the
inner
life
of
tahiti
men
who
wear
trousers
and
go
to
church
by
day
would
fear
to
sleep
at
night
unless
a
lamp
burned
in
the
house
to
repel
the
and
ghastly
of
their
ancestors
if
a
girl
falls
ill
the
native
lineal
descendant
of
the
heathen
called
in
what
have
you
done
during
the
past
week
he
asks
you
spoke
harshly
to
that
old
woman
ah
i
knew
there
was
a
cause
he
administers
a
remedy
in
the
form
of
a
certain
bath
or
a
sprinkling
with
the
water
of
a
young
coconut
and
takes
his
leave
if
the
girl
recovers
it
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
doctor
s
skill
if
she
dies
it
is
proof
that
her
offense
was
too
grave
to
be
remedied
perhaps
a
ghost
walks
and
the
native
doctor
is
again
consulted
it
is
your
wife
who
comes
to
trouble
you
at
night
how
was
she
buried
eventually
the
grave
is
opened
and
the
body
found
to
be
lying
face
down
when
turned
on
her
back
and
again
covered
with
earth
the
lady
is
content
and
ceases
her
disreputable
prowlings
i
am
not
convinced
that
all
of
these
things
are
absurdity
i
told
you
when
we
were
on
the
schooner
about
some
of
my
curious
experiences
in
this
group
there
are
happenings
fully
as
strange
on
tahiti
and
moorea
you
must
have
heard
of
what
the
natives
call
vague
variety
of
devil
a
sort
of
earth
spirit
quite
unhuman
and
intensely
malignant
the
people
are
not
fond
of
discussing
this
subject
and
their
beliefs
have
become
so
tangled
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
straightforward
story
but
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
numbers
of
these
are
thought
to
lie
in
wait
wherever
a
man
or
woman
is
dying
struggling
fiercely
with
one
another
in
their
effort
to
catch
and
devour
the
departing
human
soul
if
the
spirit
makes
its
escape
the
first
time
the
ravening
watchers
do
not
give
up
hope
but
linger
about
the
body
to
which
the
soul
is
apt
to
return
from
time
to
time
during
the
day
or
two
following
death
the
human
soul
at
this
stage
is
considered
nearly
as
malignant
and
dangerous
as
the
can
see
what
a
garbled
business
it
is
sometimes
an
earth
spirit
enters
the
corrupted
body
and
walks
abroad
at
night
on
one
subject
the
natives
all
agree
the
struggles
of
the
preying
spirits
and
the
human
soul
are
apt
to
be
marked
by
splashes
and
pools
of
blood
i
have
never
learned
to
my
satisfaction
a
friend
of
educated
and
skeptical
englishman
in
whose
word
i
have
the
utmost
the
witness
of
one
of
these
affairs
he
lived
on
moorea
just
across
from
tahiti
haapiti
was
the
village
i
think
one
afternoon
he
whistled
to
his
fox
terrier
and
strolled
to
a
house
where
the
body
of
a
native
an
old
fellow
he
had
liked
lay
in
state
surrounded
by
mourning
relatives
as
he
stood
on
the
veranda
the
dog
began
to
growl
furiously
and
at
the
same
moment
the
oldest
man
sort
of
doctor
and
authority
on
spiritual
out
suddenly
that
everyone
must
leave
the
house
the
native
explained
afterward
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
like
a
small
shapeless
and
luminous
body
trailing
a
fiery
horizontally
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
the
people
gathered
outside
in
a
bit
of
a
panic
the
fox
terrier
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
on
the
cowing
and
leaping
forward
with
frenzied
growls
toward
some
invisible
thing
all
at
once
there
was
a
great
racket
of
overturned
furniture
inside
the
house
and
next
moment
the
englishman
saw
gouts
of
what
looked
like
blood
splashing
over
the
outer
wall
and
the
floor
of
the
veranda
the
dog
was
was
a
week
before
his
coat
was
clean
the
net
result
of
the
affair
was
that
the
veranda
needed
a
cleaning
a
couple
of
tables
were
overturned
and
the
body
of
the
old
man
considerably
disturbed
but
its
most
curious
feature
is
the
fact
that
my
native
trickery
and
the
desire
to
impress
a
white
a
specimen
of
the
blood
across
to
papeete
where
he
got
the
hospital
people
to
examine
it
it
was
human
blood
beyond
a
doubt
what
do
you
make
of
that
the
other
evening
when
i
was
having
a
yarn
with
apakura
she
told
me
about
another
kind
of
who
figures
as
the
villain
in
the
tale
of
a
polynesian
cinderella
it
may
interest
you
a
great
many
years
ago
on
ahu
ahu
there
was
a
man
named
of
apakura
s
renowned
fighting
man
who
dabbled
in
sorcery
when
there
were
no
wars
to
be
fought
tall
handsome
and
famous
it
was
no
wonder
that
tautu
was
pursued
by
all
the
island
sisters
in
particular
who
went
so
far
as
to
build
a
hut
near
where
he
lived
hoping
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
hero
they
took
their
finest
ornaments
and
robes
of
tapa
and
went
to
live
in
the
hut
accompanied
by
their
little
sister
titiara
who
was
to
act
as
a
drudge
about
the
house
young
titiara
had
no
designs
on
tautu
and
she
possessed
no
finery
to
make
herself
beautiful
in
his
eyes
but
one
day
when
she
was
gathering
wood
in
the
bush
he
chanced
to
pass
stopping
to
speak
with
her
he
was
struck
with
her
goodness
and
beauty
and
from
that
time
the
two
met
every
day
in
the
forest
the
older
sisters
meanwhile
were
the
victims
of
a
mischievous
earth
spirit
which
haunted
the
vicinity
and
visited
them
in
the
guise
of
tautu
they
were
it
was
known
that
they
had
won
the
warrior
s
favors
all
their
friends
would
be
wild
with
jealousy
they
could
not
resist
preening
themselves
before
their
little
sister
tautu
loves
us
they
told
her
he
comes
every
day
when
you
are
off
gathering
but
that
is
impossible
said
titiara
for
tautu
is
my
lover
he
meets
me
each
day
in
the
the
older
girls
laughed
scornfully
at
this
but
titiara
said
no
more
until
she
met
her
lover
in
the
evening
when
she
told
him
what
her
sisters
had
said
he
laughed
it
is
a
he
informed
her
a
mischievous
spirit
whose
true
appearance
is
that
of
a
hideous
old
man
i
will
prove
to
your
sisters
that
it
is
not
i
who
visit
that
night
tautu
sat
up
late
weaving
a
magic
net
of
hibiscus
net
which
had
the
property
of
causing
a
spirit
to
assume
its
true
shape
next
afternoon
tautu
and
titiara
stole
up
to
the
house
where
the
spirit
in
the
form
of
a
splendid
warrior
was
talking
and
laughing
with
the
two
sisters
tautu
cast
the
net
next
moment
the
spirit
was
howling
and
struggling
in
the
magic
meshes
unable
to
escape
moaning
as
it
shriveled
and
changed
to
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
trembling
and
hideous
the
two
sisters
shrank
back
in
loathing
and
mortification
while
tautu
told
them
that
he
had
chosen
titiara
to
be
his
wife
as
he
finished
his
story
tari
rose
crossed
the
room
to
a
bookshelf
and
returned
to
hand
me
a
volume
bound
in
worn
yellow
leather
i
m
going
to
turn
in
now
he
remarked
we
ll
go
fishing
in
the
morning
if
you
will
plan
to
stop
over
take
this
to
your
room
if
you
are
not
sleepy
it
is
worth
running
s
account
of
the
voyage
of
the
published
at
dublin
in
seventeen
propped
up
in
bed
with
a
lamp
burning
on
the
table
beside
me
i
opened
bligh
s
quaint
and
earnest
account
of
his
voyage
the
mutiny
the
commander
s
passage
in
an
open
boat
from
tonga
to
timor
and
the
settlement
of
the
mutineers
on
pitcairn
island
have
been
made
familiar
by
a
voluminous
and
sentimental
literature
but
i
had
never
before
come
across
the
story
of
bligh
s
residence
among
the
natives
of
tahiti
one
hundred
and
years
ago
more
than
any
other
eastern
island
perhaps
tahiti
was
the
cradle
of
the
oceanic
race
called
the
lap
of
god
by
kamapiikai
the
fabled
hawaiian
voyager
who
discovered
in
the
southern
group
the
fountain
of
eternal
youth
knowing
something
of
the
island
as
it
is
i
had
listened
with
interest
when
tari
remarked
civilization
has
barely
scratched
the
inner
life
of
tahiti
bligh
was
a
close
observer
blessed
with
insight
and
a
pleasant
sense
of
humor
at
the
time
of
his
visit
the
people
were
untouched
by
european
influence
it
is
interesting
to
check
his
observations
against
what
any
traveler
may
see
judge
for
oneself
how
deeply
the
civilization
of
europe
has
been
able
to
modify
the
peculiarities
of
polynesian
character
the
family
of
pomare
of
which
the
chief
tu
called
otoo
by
cook
tinah
by
bligh
was
the
founder
owed
its
rise
to
power
largely
to
the
friendship
of
the
english
bligh
often
entertained
tinah
and
his
wife
iddeah
on
board
the
must
have
been
amusing
parties
tinah
was
fed
by
one
of
his
attendants
who
sat
by
him
for
that
purpose
and
i
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
kept
his
attendant
constantly
employed
there
was
indeed
little
reason
to
complain
of
want
of
appetite
in
any
of
my
guests
as
the
women
are
not
allowed
to
eat
in
presence
of
the
men
iddeah
dined
with
some
of
her
companions
about
an
hour
afterward
in
private
except
that
her
husband
tinah
favored
them
with
his
company
and
seemed
to
have
entirely
forgotten
that
he
had
already
dined
in
his
rambles
about
the
island
bligh
noticed
precisely
what
strikes
one
in
any
house
that
we
wished
to
enter
we
always
experienced
a
kind
reception
and
without
officiousness
the
otaheiteans
have
the
most
perfect
easiness
of
manners
equally
free
from
forwardness
and
formality
when
they
offer
refreshments
if
they
are
not
accepted
they
do
not
think
of
offering
them
the
second
time
for
they
have
not
the
least
idea
of
that
ceremonious
kind
of
refusal
which
expects
a
second
invitation
bligh
was
not
deceived
like
the
french
philosophers
who
read
bougainville
s
account
of
tahiti
and
rhapsodized
about
the
beauty
of
a
life
free
from
all
restraint
he
remarked
the
system
of
class
inherent
in
the
island
race
a
system
of
which
the
outward
marks
are
gone
but
which
is
far
from
dead
among
people
so
free
from
ostentation
as
the
otaheiteans
and
whose
manners
are
so
simple
and
natural
the
strictness
with
which
the
punctilios
of
rank
are
observed
is
surprising
i
know
not
if
any
action
however
meritorious
can
elevate
a
man
above
the
class
in
which
he
was
born
unless
he
were
to
acquire
sufficient
power
to
confer
dignity
on
himself
if
any
woman
of
the
inferior
classes
has
a
child
by
an
earee
it
is
not
suffered
to
live
bligh
s
observations
on
the
gay
and
humorous
character
of
the
people
and
their
extraordinary
levity
might
have
been
written
yesterday
some
of
my
constant
visitors
had
observed
that
we
always
drank
his
majesty
s
health
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
but
they
were
by
this
time
become
so
fond
of
wine
that
they
would
frequently
remind
me
of
the
health
in
the
middle
of
dinner
by
calling
out
king
george
earee
no
brittanee
and
would
banter
me
if
the
glass
was
not
filled
to
the
brim
nothing
could
exceed
the
mirth
and
jollity
of
these
people
when
they
met
on
board
one
day
tinah
told
bligh
of
an
island
to
the
eastward
of
otaheite
four
or
five
days
sail
and
that
there
were
large
animals
upon
it
with
eight
legs
the
truth
of
this
account
he
very
strenuously
insisted
upon
and
wished
me
to
go
thither
with
him
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
or
not
tinah
himself
gave
credit
to
this
whimsical
and
fabulous
account
for
though
they
have
credulity
sufficient
to
believe
anything
however
improbable
they
are
at
the
same
time
so
much
addicted
to
that
species
of
wit
which
we
call
humbug
that
it
is
frequently
difficult
to
distinguish
whether
they
are
in
jest
or
in
earnest
on
another
occasion
while
walking
near
a
place
of
burial
bligh
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
outcry
of
grief
as
i
expressed
a
desire
to
see
the
distressed
person
tinah
took
me
to
the
place
where
i
found
a
number
of
women
one
of
whom
was
the
mother
of
a
young
female
child
that
lay
dead
on
seeing
us
their
mourning
not
only
immediately
ceased
but
to
my
astonishment
they
all
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
and
while
we
remained
appeared
much
diverted
at
our
visit
i
told
tinah
the
woman
had
no
sorrow
for
her
child
otherwise
her
grief
would
not
have
so
easily
subsided
on
which
he
jocosely
told
her
to
cry
again
they
did
not
however
resume
their
mourning
in
our
presence
this
strange
behavior
would
incline
us
to
think
them
and
unfeeling
did
we
not
know
that
they
are
fond
parents
and
in
general
very
affectionate
it
is
therefore
to
be
ascribed
to
their
extreme
levity
of
disposition
and
it
is
probable
that
death
does
not
appear
to
them
with
so
many
terrors
as
it
does
to
people
of
a
more
serious
cast
when
the
surgeon
of
the
died
and
was
buried
ashore
some
of
the
chiefs
were
very
inquisitive
about
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
surgeon
s
cabin
on
account
of
apparitions
they
said
when
a
man
died
in
otaheite
and
was
carried
to
the
tupapow
that
as
soon
as
night
came
he
was
surrounded
by
spirits
and
if
any
person
went
there
by
himself
they
would
devour
him
therefore
they
said
that
not
less
than
two
people
together
should
go
into
the
surgeon
s
cabin
for
some
time
i
thought
of
tari
and
his
tales
of
the
four
generations
of
schools
and
churches
have
failed
to
work
a
metamorphosis
i
read
on
till
drowsiness
overcame
me
and
the
pages
blurred
before
my
eyes
it
was
late
and
the
night
was
very
calm
a
vagrant
night
breeze
wandering
down
from
the
mountains
rustled
gently
among
the
fronds
of
the
old
palms
around
the
house
when
the
rustling
faint
as
to
be
almost
could
hear
the
whisper
of
the
sea
the
world
about
me
was
asleep
i
roused
myself
with
an
effort
adjusted

the
valley
of
it
is
not
easy
to
analyze
the
magic
which
cozens
every
traveler
into
believing
that
he
is
the
first
to
see
tahiti
with
clear
feels
that
it
is
made
up
of
nature
in
a
mood
of
unearthly
loveliness
of
a
sense
of
ancient
and
unalterable
life
of
a
realization
that
strange
beliefs
persist
under
a
semblance
of
christianity
of
the
lure
of
a
race
whose
confidence
the
white
man
can
never
fully
gain
the
mail
steamers
the
wireless
the
traders
the
scattering
of
french
things
are
a
mere
play
of
shadows
on
the
surface
even
the
churches
i
was
tempted
to
say
but
the
church
plays
more
than
a
shadowy
part
in
the
life
of
the
native
whose
religion
at
the
present
day
is
a
singular
blending
of
christian
doctrine
and
old
heathen
belief
the
tahitian
reads
his
bible
he
has
no
other
book
and
sings
loudly
every
sunday
in
church
but
the
dead
are
still
things
of
horror
in
his
mind
as
carry
on
a
brisk
trade
and
tautau
the
is
still
a
living
presence
in
the
valley
of
punaruu
when
the
people
of
the
society
islands
accepted
christianity
a
century
ago
they
did
so
with
reservations
of
which
the
missionaries
perhaps
were
not
aware
here
and
there
as
at
faatoai
on
moorea
there
was
a
burning
of
idols
but
a
great
mass
of
gods
and
heathen
stored
in
secure
hiding
places
among
the
hills
after
three
generations
of
increasing
european
influence
hundreds
of
natives
know
of
these
caves
and
repair
to
them
for
purposes
of
their
own
yet
a
white
man
might
spend
his
life
on
tahiti
without
a
glimpse
of
a
orooro
or
a
slender
ironwood
spear
my
friend
airima
is
typical
the
widow
of
a
yankee
skipper
the
owner
of
a
neat
wooden
villa
in
papeete
where
she
appears
regularly
on
her
way
to
church
in
shoes
stockings
and
a
gown
she
finds
it
necessary
from
time
to
time
to
cast
off
the
unnatural
manners
of
europe
and
live
as
she
was
meant
to
live
to
be
herself
an
elderly
and
delightful
savage
when
the
mood
comes
she
closes
the
villa
in
papeete
gathers
the
willing
members
of
her
family
and
repairs
to
her
native
house

off
on
the
peninsula
of

on
the

out
gently
to

with
darting
shoals
of

the

broken
by
a

through
which
the
steady
lines
of
combers
sweep
in
to
crash
and
tumble
on
the

morning
and
afternoon
the
breakers
are
alive
with

in

as
they
ride
the

inland
the

marking
the

is
lost
in

of
broken
and
fantastic
peaks

bordering

a
place
not
easily
forgotten
it
was
still
dark
when
we
and
i
the
brothers
of
maruae
had
returned
from
the
reef
and
the
ovens
behind
the
cook
house
were
smoking
for
in
these
places
the
hour
of
the
day
s
first
meal
is
set
by
the
return
of
the
fishermen
i
took
one
shuddering
plunge
into
the
river
dressed
myself
in
a
shirt
a
waistcloth
and
a
pair
of
hobnailed
boots
and
squatted
with
the
rest
to
consume
a
mackerel
and
a
section
of
breadfruit
dipped
in
the
common
bowl
of
sauce
maruae
sucked
his
fingers
and
stood
up
calling
to
the
dogs
airima
glanced
at
me
over
the
back
of
a
large
fish
she
was
gnawing
holding
it
with
both
hands
go
you
two
she
said
you
stay
replied
maruae
as
he
turned
to
take
the
path
to
the
mountains
the
oceanic
tongue
possesses
no
other
words
of
parting
we
followed
the
river
across
the
flatlands
of
the
coast
dawn
was
flushing
in
the
east
the
profile
of
lofty
ridges
fern
clad
and
incredibly
serrated
grew
sharp
against
the
sky
the
mynahs
were
awakening
from
the
thick
foliage
of
orange
and
mango
trees
came
their
extraordinary
morning
thousand
voices
whistling
screaming
and
chattering
that
it
was
time
the
assembly
broke
up
for
the
foraging
of
another
day
in
one
place
where
a
turn
of
the
path
brought
us
suddenly
to
the
edge
of
a
still
reach
of
water
a
pair
of
native
ducks
rose
vertically
on
beating
wings
and
sped
off
over
the
palm
tops
a
little
farther
on
where
volcanic
bowlders
began
to
appear
through
the
alluvial
soil
and
the
river
leaped
and
foamed
over
the
first
rapids
a
family
of
tahitian
jungle
fowl
led
by
a
splendid
burnished
cock
sprang
out
of
the
grass
and
streamed
away
in
easy
rapid
flight
toward
the
hills
the
dogs
bounded
forward
and
stopped
whining
as
they
watched
the
wild
chickens
dwindle
to
speeding
dots
the
groves
of
coconut
palms
and
open
pasture
land
were
behind
us
now
the
valley
was
narrowing
hemmed
in
by
cliffs
to
which
a
tangle
of
vegetation
clung
the
river
had
become
a
torrent
boiling
and
waist
over
cataracts
roaring
down
dark
rapids
under
a
roof
of
matted
trees
giant
hibiscus
a
yard
through
too
remote
to
tempt
the
ax
of
the
canoe
builder
candle
nut
barringtonia
and
mapé
the
island
chestnut
with
boles
like
fluted
columns
of
a
temple
the
trail
wound
back
and
forth
across
the
river
over
the
trunks
of
fallen
trees
around
masses
of
rock
tumbled
from
the
cliffs
above
mounting
higher
and
higher
into
the
heart
of
the
island
once
as
we
stopped
to
rest
i
looked
back
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
wedge
of
blue
far
behind
us
and
below
the
dogs
had
begun
to
range
ahead
for
they
knew
that
any
moment
we
might
start
a
sounder
of
wild
pig
i
was
growing
was
not
easy
to
follow
maruae
at
his
own
gait
he
walked
with
the
rapid
springy
tread
of
a
mountain
man
when
he
stooped
to
clear
a
limb
or
lopped
off
a
section
of
creeper
with
an
easy
swing
of
his
machete
i
admired
the
play
of
muscles
on
his
back
rippling
powerfully
under
the
smooth
brown
skin
silken
and
it
be
by
skin
of
these
people
is
not
like
ours
but
softer
and
closer
in
texture
seeming
like
marble
to
glimmer
with
reflected
light
the
gorge
grew
narrower
we
rounded
a
buttress
of
jointed
basalt
and
came
suddenly
into
the
light
and
open
of
a
lonely
valley
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
twice
as
long
set
high
above
the
sea
and
hemmed
in
by
untrodden
ridges
it
lay
here
uninhabited
and
forgotten
in
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
roar
of
savage
cataracts
and
the
bellowing
of
wild
bulls
yet
man
had
been
here
along
the
base
of
the
cliffs
we
found
the
terraced
stone
of
his
dwellings
the
blocks
of
volcanic
rock
pried
apart
by
the
roots
of
huge
old
trees
maruae
was
squatting
on
his
heels
beside
me
contemplating
in
silence
these
relics
of
an
older
time
finally
he
turned
his
head
those
stones
are
very
old
he
remarked
they
have
been
here
always
since
the
beginning
men
placed
them
there
and
men
slept
on
them
but
not
the
men
of
my
people
my
thoughts
dwelt
on
the
old
idle
tales
i
had
the
lizard
men
of
the
aborigines
the
manahune
said
to
have
been
in
possession
of
the
land
when
the
eyes
of
polynesian
voyagers
first
rested
on
cloudy
orofena
there
were
other
tales
too
of
a
later
day
of
a
tribe
of
men
dwelling
in
the
valleys
neither
tasting
fish
nor
setting
foot
on
the
beach
except
when
at
certain
intervals
they
were
permitted
to
come
down
to
worship
by
the
sea
even
it
needs
no
effort
of
the
imagination
to
see
two
distinct
types
among
the
island
people
men
and
women
of
the
kind
one
considers
typically
clean
limbed
and
light
brown
with
clear
dark
eyes
straight
or
waving
hair
and
heads
not
differing
greatly
from
the
heads
of
europeans
and
another
kind
of
a
negroid
or
melanesian
squat
and
many
shades
darker
in
complexion
and
apish
with
muddy
eyes
kinky
hair
and
flattened
undeveloped
heads
and
strangely
enough
after
more
than
a
century
of
missions
and
leveling
foreign
influence
the
dark
and
awkward
people
seem
still
to
fill
the
humbler
walks
of
are
the
servants
and
dependents
the
feeders
of
pigs
the
carriers
of
wood
and
water
great
stature
physical
beauty
and
light
complexion
are
still
the
hall
marks
of
aristocratic
birth
writing
of
the
islands
a
hundred
years
ago
old
ellis
the
closest
observer
of
them
all
remarked
it
is
a
singular
fact
in
the
physiology
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
part
of
the
world
that
the
chiefs
and
persons
of
hereditary
rank
and
influence
of
the
islands
are
almost
without
exception
as
much
superior
to
the
peasantry
or
common
people
in
stateliness
dignified
deportment
and
physical
strength
as
they
are
in
rank
and
circumstances
although
they
are
not
elected
to
their
station
on
account
of
their
personal
endowments
but
derive
their
rank
and
elevation
from
their
ancestry
this
is
the
case
with
most
of
the
groups
of
the
pacific
but
peculiarly
so
in
tahiti
and
the
adjacent
isles
the
father
of
the
late
king
was
six
feet
four
inches
high
pomare
was
six
feet
two
the
present
king
of
raiatea
is
equally
tall
their
limbs
are
generally
well
formed
and
the
whole
figure
is
proportioned
to
their
height
which
renders
the
difference
between
the
rulers
and
their
subjects
so
striking
that
bougainville
and
some
others
have
supposed
they
were
a
distinct
race
the
descendants
of
a
superior
people
who
at
a
remote
period
had
conquered
the
aborigines
and
perpetuated
their
supremacy
there
is
a
curious
inconsistency
in
the
matter
of
complexion
for
in
the
old
days
a
dark
skin
was
considered
the
sign
of
a
strong
warlike
and
masterly
man
ellis
records
an
extract
from
an
old
song
if
dark
be
the
complexion
of
the
mother
the
son
will
sound
the
conch
shell
and
yet
on
the
same
page
he
observes
that
the
majority
of
the
reigning
family
in
raiatea
are
not
darker
than
the
inhabitants
of
some
parts
of
southern
europe
while
maruae
and
i
rested
among
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
settlement
the
dogs
had
been
more
usefully
engaged
my
musings
were
disturbed
by
a
sudden
burst
of
squeals
punctuated
by
excited
yelpings
maruae
sprang
to
his
feet
long
knife
in
hand
it
was
only
a
small
pig
a
but
he
was
bursting
fat
stuffed
with
vi
apples
fallen
from
the
great
tree
under
which
he
had
been
feeding
the
dogs
had
him
by
the
ears
when
we
arrived
a
thrust
of
the
machete
put
an
end
to
his
short
and
idyllic
life
i
hung
him
from
a
branch
and
skinned
him
while
maruae
went
off
in
search
of
presently
he
returned
carrying
on
his
shoulder
a
stout
pole
of
hibiscus
from
either
end
of
which
swung
a
bunch
of
the
mountain
plantains
like
huge
thick
bananas
the
size
of
quart
bottles
and
bright
yellowish
red
there
was
a
clump
of
palms
near
by
another
sign
perhaps
of
man
s
former
relics
of
unnumbered
vegetable
generations
we
had
coconuts
to
drink
pork
and
were
at
hand
and
plenty
of
crayfish
to
be
had
in
the
river
in
the
islands
the
obtaining
of
food
is
always
the
signal
for
a
meal
maruae
beckoned
to
me
and
led
the
way
to
the
river
where
he
readjusted
his
waistcloth
to
leave
a
kind
of
apron
hanging
in
front
and
plunged
up
to
his
armpits
in
the
still
water
with
the
apron
spread
as
a
trap
for
the
darting
crayfish
he
moved
slowly
along
the
grassy
and
overhanging
bank
of
the
stream
stopping
every
moment
or
so
to
hand
a
struggling
victim
up
to
me
this
little
lobster
is
one
of
the
most
delicious
shellfish
in
the
the
same
dimensions
as
the
french
ecrivisse
and
not
unlike
it
in
flavor
in
fifteen
minutes
we
had
enough
and
the
work
of
preparing
our
meal
began
i
gathered
wood
and
started
a
fire
against
a
face
of
rock
maruae
cut
a
section
of
giant
bamboo
half
filled
it
with
water
threw
in
the
crayfish
and
stood
it
beside
the
fire
to
boil
our
meal
was
genuinely
primitive
i
had
cigarettes
matches
and
a
paper
of
salt
stowed
in
the
tuck
of
my
our
knives
we
had
nothing
else
that
the
rudest
of
savages
might
not
have
possessed
turning
up
the
earth
with
his
machete
my
companion
scraped
out
a
shallow
maori
oven
he
set
a
ring
of
stones
about
the
edge
lined
the
inside
with
pebbles
and
filled
the
whole
with
coals
from
our
while
the
coals
glowed
heating
the
earth
and
stones
he
cut
off
a
loin
and
hindquarter
of
pork
wrapped
the
meat
carefully
in
plantain
leaves
and
selected
half
a
dozen
of
the
riper
plantains
for
our
meal
finally
when
the
oven
was
thoroughly
hot
he
scraped
away
the
coals
from
the
middle
laid
in
the
pork
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
plantains
pushed
the
hot
stones
close
to
the
food
and
covered
the
whole
with
a
thick
layer
of
plantain
leaves
we
ate
the
to
a
bright
the
balance
of
our
meal
was
cooking
i
added
salt
to
the
liquor
in
the
bottom
of
the
bamboo
and
dipped
in
this
natural
sauce
the
first
course
whetted
our
appetites
for
the
tender
meat
and
juicy
plantains
which
soon
came
from
the
oven
as
we
lay
smoking
after
our
meal
i
could
see
that
maruae
had
something
in
his
mind
and
was
debating
whether
or
not
to
speak
finally
he
began
cautiously
and
with
an
air
of
skeptical
restraint
at
first
but
with
more
and
more
assurance
as
he
saw
that
i
listened
seriously
to
his
story
the
old
people
say
he
remarked
pointing
to
the
head
of
the
valley
where
the
cliffs
narrowed
to
a
deep
crack
through
which
the
river
rushed
that
far
up
in
this
same
valley
beyond
the
upper
gorge
you
see
a
spirit
dwells
one
of
the
heathen
spirits
which
are
as
old
as
the
land
you
and
i
may
not
believe
in
these
things
but
it
is
good
when
the
evenings
are
long
to
listen
to
the
stories
of
the
old
men
the
name
of
this
spirit
is
tefatu
some
call
him
saying
that
he
dogs
the
footsteps
of
the
living
and
preys
upon
the
souls
of
the
newly
dead
but
that
is
not
true
for
many
times
in
the
memory
of
my
fathers
he
has
been
known
to
aid
those
in
perplexity
or
distress
the
old
men
believe
that
if
a
traveler
lost
in
these
mountains
at
nightfall
calls
on
tefatu
for
succor
the
spirit
will
appear
before
him
in
the
likeness
of
a
pale
moving
fire
and
lead
him
in
safety
down
to
the
sea
once
in
sight
of
the
sea
the
man
must
cry
out
in
a
loud
voice
you
have
aided
me
tefatu
and
i
am
content
stop
here
and
i
will
go
on
my
it
is
not
good
to
neglect
these
words
of
parting
sometimes
he
is
seen
at
night
flying
from
ridge
to
ridge
of
the
great
glowing
head
trailing
a
thin
body
of
fire
long
ago
during
the
childhood
of
my
grandmother
tefatu
left
this
land
for
a
space
of
years
men
said
that
he
had
flown
to
hawaii
but
now
he
is
returned
beyond
a
doubt
high
up
among
the
cliffs
i
found
the
cave
in
which
he
sleeps
by
day
these
eyes
of
mine
have
seen
the
old
lord
lying
there
among
the
whitened
heads
of
looked
and
turned
away
quickly
for
my
stomach
was
cold
with
fear
i
can
not
tell
you
clearly
maruae
went
on
in
answer
to
my
obvious
question
for
i
was
greatly
afraid
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
a
figure
of
wood
longer
and
thinner
than
a
man
black
with
age
covered
with
carved
patterns
and
bound
in
places
with
close
wrappings
of
fine
sennit
my
people
have
forgotten
how
to
make
the
place
was
full
of
bones
scores
of
men
had
been
slain
and
their
bodies
offered
there
as
was
the
custom
of
our
old
kings
once
not
many
years
ago
a
wise
man
came
here
from
the
islands
of
old
man
bearded
and
wearing
spectacles
it
was
his
work
to
write
down
the
names
of
our
ancestors
and
he
spoke
our
tongue
though
haltingly
and
with
a
strange
twist
he
lived
with
us
for
a
time
and
we
grew
fond
of
him
for
he
was
a
simple
man
who
made
us
laugh
with
his
jokes
and
was
kind
to
the
children
one
evening
i
told
him
how
i
had
found
the
place
of
tefatu
as
i
spoke
his
eyes
grew
bright
behind
their
windows
of
glass
and
when
i
had
done
he
begged
me
in
great
excitement
to
lead
him
to
the
a
hundred
of
your
dollars
if
i
could
prove
that
i
had
spoken
true
words
i
was
younger
then
and
in
need
of
money
for
i
was
courting
a
girl
we
went
together
into
the
mountains
but
as
we
drew
near
the
place
something
within
me
made
me
hesitate
and
i
grew
afraid
in
the
end
i
deceived
that
man
who
was
my
friend
telling
him
that
i
could
not
find
the
way
he
was
indeed
a
wise
man
another
would
have
mocked
me
for
a
liar
and
a
teller
of
idle
tales
but
he
only
smiled
looking
at
me
knew
that
my
words
were
true
and
that
i
feared
to
betray
the
sleeping
place
of
the
old
lord
maruae
rose
to
his
feet
with
the
sigh
of
a
man
who
has
eaten
well
and
is
deprived
of
his
rightful
siesta
he
shouldered
his
ponderous
load
of
i
could
scarcely
raise
from
the
led
the
way
toward
the
sea
while
i
followed
bearing
the
remnants
of
the
pig
it
was
noon
when
we
reached
the
flatlands
of
the
coast
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
the
house
of
airima
we
stopped
to
watch
a
large
canoe
loaded
with
a
mound
of
seine
gliding
up
the
river
followed
by
a
fleet
of
smaller
craft
an
old
woman
stood
in
the
bow
directing
the
proceedings
with
shrill
volubility
she
was
the
proprietor
of
the
net
a
village
character
at
once
kindly
and
of
one
chief
and
mother
of
another
as
her
canoe
drew
abreast
of
us
she
gave
the
command
to
halt
and
spread
the
net
the
river
at
this
point
is
almost
without
current
very
still
and
clear
maruae
and
i
sat
on
the
high
bank
too
tired
to
do
more
than
play
the
part
of
spectators
they
grounded
the
big
canoe
just
below
where
we
sat
putting
one
end
of
the
seine
ashore
and
paddling
slowly
across
the
river
while
the
net
was
laid
out
in
a
deep
sagging
curve
downstream
one
after
another
the
smaller
canoes
were
beached
and
the
people
half
naked
and
carrying
spears
ran
along
the
bank
to
take
to
the
water
a
few
hundred
yards
above
the
river
was
alive
with
them
splashing
and
shouting
as
they
drove
the
fish
toward
the
trap
next
moment
the
bright
shoals
began
to
appear
beneath
us
the
sunlight
glinting
on
burnished
sides
as
they
darted
this
way
and
that
by
hundreds
seeking
a
way
of
escape
a
run
of
mullet
flashed
downstream
saw
the
net
turned
and
were
headed
back
toward
the
sea
a
series
of
cries
went
aué
fifty
or
sixty
of
the
beautiful
silvery
fish
leaped
the
line
of
floats
and
dashed
away
to
safety
the
old
headwoman
dressed
in
a
mother
hubbard
of
respectable
black
and
a
rather
handsome
hat
was
swimming
easily
in
three
fathoms
of
water
nothing
escaped
her
watchful
eye
ara
she
shouted
angrily
the
best
fish
are
getting
away
hurry
you
lazy
the
water
below
the
net
or
we
shall
not
have
a
mullet
left
remember
that
when
the
haul
is
over
he
who
has
not
worked
shall
have
no
fish
as
the
line
of
beaters
drew
near
the
men
in
the
big
canoe
paddled
upstream
and
across
behind
them
throwing
out
net
as
they
went
until
the
frightened
fish
and
a
score
of
swimmers
were
encircled
the
two
ends
of
the
seine
were
now
close
together
on
the
bank
and
half
a
dozen
men
began
to
haul
in
with
a
will
their
efforts
causing
the
circle
to
narrow
slowly
and
steadily
looking
down
from
the
high
bank
one
could
see
children
of
ten
or
twelve
stark
naked
and
carrying
tiny
spears
in
their
hands
swimming
like
frogs
a
fathom
deep
in
the
clear
water
pursuing
the
darting
fish
now
and
then
a
youngster
came
to
the
surface
with
a
shrill
cry
of
triumph
holding
aloft
the
toy
spear
on
which
was
transfixed
a
fish
the
people
of
the
islands
as
a
rule
are
neither
fast
nor
showy
swimmers
one
can
see
prettier
swimming
any
summer
afternoon
on
the
long
island
shore
but
the
polynesian
is
at
home
in
the
water
in
a
way
the
white
man
can
never
match
i
watched
an
old
woman
all
of
seventy
and
wearing
a
black
blouse
girded
tightly
to
her
waist
with
a
treading
water
at
the
lower
end
of
the
net
where
the
fish
were
beginning
to
concentrate
she
was
as
much
at
her
ease
as
though
she
had
been
lying
on
her
veranda
exchanging
gossip
with
a
neighbor
each
time
she
thought
the
headwoman
s
eyes
were
turned
away
she
reached
over
the
net
seized
a
fish
and
stuffed
it
into
her
blouse
until
a
flapping
bulge
hung
down
over
her
but
old
tinomana
s
eyes
were
sharp
enough
she
cried
half
laughing
and
half
in
anger
tera
vahine
e
perhaps
she
thought
to
get
a
string
of
fish
too
for
that
worthless
of
hers
at
length
the
seine
lay
in
two
great
piles
on
the
beach
and
only
a
bulging
pocket
filled
with
a
pulsating
mass
of
silver
remained
in
the
river
under
the
direction
of
tinomana
the
fish
were
divided
into
little
piles
strung
on
bits
of
hibiscus
bark
and
apportioned
among
the
people
according
to
the
size
of
their
families
and
the
amount
of
help
they
had
given
in
the
haul
for
herself
she
reserved
a
considerable
share
for
her
household
was
large
and
as
the
owner
of
the
net
she
was
entitled
to
a
full
than
she
loaded
into
the
big
canoe
it
was
early
afternoon
when
we
laid
down
our
burdens
in
the
cook
house
and
stripped
for
a
swim
the
others
were
awakening
from
their
siesta
a
flock
of
brown
children
all
vaguely
related
to
the
family
of
airima
followed
us
to
the
river
carrying
miniature
surf
boards
next
moment
they
were
in
the
water
splashing
and
shouting
as
they
paddled
downstream
toward
where
the
surf
broke
on
the
bar
tehinatu
the
pretty
sister
of
maruae
passed
us
with
a
rush
and
leaped
feet
first
from
the
high
bank
she
rose
to
the
surface
thirty
yards
away
shouting
a
challenge
to
catch
her
before
she
could
reach
the
opposite
shore
her
brother
and
i
dove
together
raced
across
the
river
and
had
nearly
overtaken
the
girl
when
she
went
under
like
a
grebe
i
was
no
match
for
her
at
this
game
under
water
she
could
swim
as
fast
as
i
and
was
a
hundred
times
more
at
home
i
gave
up
the
pursuit
and
landed
for
a
sunning
among
the
warm
rocks
of
the
point
out
where
the
seas
reared
for
the
landward
rush
the
black
heads
of
children
appeared
and
disappeared
i
could
hear
the
joyous
screams
of
others
flattened
on
their
boards
and
racing
toward
me
buried
in
flying
spray
the
old
woman
i
had
seen
helping
herself
to
fish
was
coming
down
the
river
paddling
an
incredibly
small
canoe
laden
with
an
enormous
bunch
of
bananas
and
four
kerosene
tins
of
water
she
lived
a
mile
down
the
coast
and
like
many
of
her
neighbors
braved
the
surf
daily
to
supply
her
house
with
fresh
water
from
the
river
the
gunwale
of
her
canoe
seemed
to
clear
the
water
by
no
more
than
a
couple
of
inches
i
watched
with
some
anxiety
thinking
of
the
feelings
of
an
american
grandmother
in
the
same
situation
she
ceased
to
paddle
at
the
river
mouth
and
watched
her
chance
while
the
frail
dugout
rose
and
fell
in
the
wash
of
half
a
dozen
big
seas
then
in
a
momentary
lull
she
dug
her
paddle
into
the
water
i
sat
up
to
watch
a
boy
standing
in
the
shallows
near
by
shouted
encouragement
at
first
i
thought
that
she
had
chosen
her
moment
well
the
canoe
passed
the
white
water
topped
a
little
wave
without
swamping
and
was
seemingly
out
of
danger
but
suddenly
a
treacherous
sea
sprang
up
from
nowhere
rearing
a
tossing
crest
it
was
too
late
to
disaster
lay
ahead
stoically
without
a
sign
of
dismay
the
paddler
held
her
craft
bow
on
the
canoe
rose
wildly
against
the
foaming
wall
seemed
to
hang
for
an
instant
almost
vertically
and
then
canoe
cargo
and
old
woman
disappeared
in
the
froth
the
boy
screamed
in
ecstasy
as
he
galloped
through
the
shallows
to
lend
a
hand
the
other
children
ceased
their
play
and
soon
the
canoe
and
its
recovered
cargo
were
brought
ashore
they
emptied
the
dugout
and
filled
the
tins
with
fresh
water
i
heard
the
old
woman
laugh
shrilly
as
she
wrung
her
clothes
on
the
beach
presently
coached
by
a
dozen
amused
spectators
she
made
a
second
attempt
and
passed
the
surf
without
a
wetting
when
i
saw
her
last
she
was
paddling
off
steadily
to
the
west
i
was
dozing
among
the
rocks
when
a
ringing
whistle
startled
me
and
i
looked
up
to
see
a
bird
like
a
large
sandpiper
alight
on
the
beach
and
begin
to
feed
running
briskly
after
the
receding
waves
or
springing
into
the
air
for
a
short
flight
when
threatened
by
a
rush
of
water
it
was
a
wandering
tattler
and
no
bird
was
ever
better
named
solitary
in
its
habits
except
in
the
breeding
season
when
it
resorts
to
northern
lands
so
remote
that
its
nest
and
eggs
are
still
i
believe
unknown
it
travels
south
at
the
approach
of
winter
making
lonely
passages
across
some
of
the
widest
stretches
of
ocean
in
the
world
to
hawaii
to
the
galapagos
to
the
marquesas
and
probably
to
the
remote
southern
islands
of
polynesia
what
obscure
sense
enables
the
migrating
bird
to
follow
its
course
far
out
of
sight
of
land
in
france
i
have
flown
side
by
side
with
wild
geese
heading
steadily
southward
above
a
sea
of
clouds
it
seemed
to
me
the
pilot
of
an
might
guide
themselves
in
a
general
way
by
the
sun
the
stars
or
the
look
of
the
land
idea
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
geese
become
lost
and
confused
in
a
fog
but
in
considering
a
bird
like
the
carrier
pigeon
or
the
tattler
all
such
theorizing
comes
to
an
end
no
general
sense
of
north
and
south
could
guide
the
tattler
to
the
lonely
landfalls
of
the
south
pacific
his
the
migration
of
the
golden
plover
or
the
instinct
of
the
shearwater
which
sends
him
unerringly
on
the
darkest
night
of
storm
to
his
individual
burrow
in
the
cliff
be
classed
among
the
inexplicable
mysteries
of
nature
on
the
road
which
passes
close
to
the
house
of
airima
i
found
tehinatu
in
conversation
with
the
driver
of
a
chinese
cart
she
was
bargaining
for
a
watermelon
the
chinaman
stood
out
for
three
offered
two
enough
of
talking
she
said
firmly
the
melon
is
the
best
you
have
but
it
is
green
i
will
give
two
francs
toru
muttered
the
proprietor
of
the
melon
indifferently
means
a
franc
but
is
obviously
a
corruption
of
quarter
for
the
dollar
passed
current
here
long
before
the
money
of
france
look
at
my
clothes
pleaded
the
deceitful
girl
changing
her
tactics
suddenly
i
am
a
poor
woman
who
can
not
afford
to
pay
the
prices
you
expect
from
the
chief
come
dear
give
me
the
melon
for
two
francs
the
chinaman
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
glanced
at
me
the
glint
in
his
narrow
eye
might
have
meant
ah
these
s
the
use
he
sighed
for
a
moment
while
tehinatu
looked
at
him
pleadingly
he
was
silent
take
the
melon
he
said
and
give
me
two
francs
i
must
be
on
my
way
but
do
not
think
you
have
deceived
me
cunning
woman
i
know
that
you
are
not
poor
for
only
yesterday
your
brother
sold
the
copra
from
your
land
without
a
sign
of
embarrassment
the
girl
opened
her
hand
and
held
up
a
note
ah
you
are
rich
remarked
the
chinaman
as
he
undid
an
oilcloth
wallet
and
stripped
the
change
from
a
substantial
roll
of
bills
i
knew
it
are
you
not
ashamed
to
practice
such
deceit
but
tehinatu
only
tucked
the
melon
under
her
arm
with
a
triumphant
smile
it
is
a
curious
study
to
watch
the
contact
of
chinese
and
polynesian
races
separated
by
the
most
profound
of
gulfs
yet
possessing
the
meeting
ground
of
a
common
love
of
bargaining
all
through
the
french
islands
you
will
find
chinamen
scattered
singly
or
in
little
the
windward
and
leeward
societies
the
marquesas
among
the
distant
atolls
of
the
paumotu
in
the
remote
gambiers
in
tupuai
rurutu
and
lonely
rimatara
they
are
keepers
of
small
stores
for
the
most
part
where
you
may
see
them
interrupted
at
their
eternal
task
of
copra
making
to
exchange
a
box
of
matches
for
a
single
coconut
or
to
haggle
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
over
a
matter
of
five
sous
patient
painstaking
and
in
inconceivable
squalor
without
the
common
pleasures
which
enable
most
of
us
to
tolerate
our
seem
to
be
impelled
by
motives
far
more
profound
than
the
longing
for
material
gam
by
a
species
of
idealism
equally
incomprehensible
to
the
native
and
to
the
visitor
of
european
race
it
is
not
beyond
possibility
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
more
generations
it
will
be
the
native
islander
who
lingers
here
and
there
isolated
in
communities
principally
chinese
for
the
islanders
superb
physically
are
the
least
prolific
of
men
while
the
weedy
little
who
brings
his
own
women
with
him
or
succeeds
with
his
own
peculiar
knack
in
obtaining
women
from
a
population
which
regards
him
with
amused
contempt
surrounds
himself
with
children
in
as
short
a
time
as
nature
allows
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
secret
of
the
chinaman
s
dogged
and
labors
might
lie
to
his
cult
of
ancestor
worship
to
become
a
revered
ancestor
one
must
have
children
and
in
order
to
bring
up
properly
a
large
family
of
children
one
must
spend
one
s
life
in
unceasing
toil
i
doubt
that
europeans
in
large
numbers
will
ever
be
tempted
to
make
the
islands
their
home
the
life
is
too
alien
the
change
too
great
as
things
are
the
relation
of
polynesian
and
chinese
amounts
to
a
subtle
contest
for
the
struggle
of
which
both
parties
are
aware
the
native
incapable
of
abstract
thought
feels
and
resents
it
vaguely
to
the
chinaman
whose
days
are
spent
in
meditation
undisturbed
by
the
automatic
labors
of
his
body
the
issue
is
no
doubt
clear
cut
the
native
is
by
far
the
more
attractive
of
the
kindly
selfish
jolly
childish
well
bred
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
but
the
chinaman
possesses
the
less
attractive
qualities
which
make
for
the
survival
of
a
industry
the
unselfishness
the
capacity
to
live
for
an
in
the
end
if
only
by
force
of
numbers
he
will
win
looking
into
the
future
one
can
see
the
eastern
islands
populated
by
chinese
as
our
own
islands
of
hawaii
have
been
peopled
with
immigrants
from
japan
they
are
dying
anyway
and
they
won
t
work
the
commercial
gentleman
will
tell
you
here
is
rich
cane
land
needing
only
labor
to
produce
the
world
needs
sugar
perhaps
this
view
is
myself
i
feel
that
the
question
is
debatable
there
are
certain
parts
of
the
our
american
mountains
deserts
and
lonely
stretches
of
seem
planned
for
the
spiritual
refreshment
of
mankind
places
from
which
one
carries
away
a
new
serenity
and
the
sense
of
a
yearning
for
beauty
satisfied
ever
since
the
days
of
cook
the
islands
of
the
south
sea
have
charmed
the
white
naturalists
traders
and
the
rough
crews
of
whaling
vessels
the
strange
beauty
of
these
little
lands
insignificant
so
far
as
commercial
exploitation
is
concerned
seems
worthy
of
preservation
and
the
native
paddling
his
outlandish
canoe
or
lounging
in
picturesque
attitudes
before
his
house
is
indispensable
to
the
scene
if
the
day
comes
when
his
canoe
lies
rotting
on
the
beach
and
his
house
is
tenanted
by
industrious
the
same
jagged
peaks
rise
against
the
sky
and
the
same
sea
thunders
lazily
along
the
the
anchor
drops
and
the
call
comes
to
go
ashore
i
for
one
shall
hesitate
in
the
cook
group
six
hundred
miles
west
of
tahiti
the
prospect
is
less
depressing
for
the
british
have
adopted
a
policy
of
exclusion
and
made
it
impossible
for
the
native
to
sell
his
land
the
reinforced
here
and
there
with
a
dash
of
white
blood
and
undiscouraged
by
a
competition
he
is
not
fitted
to
meet
seems
to
be
holding
his
own
the
reason
is
native
has
been
little
tampered
with
left
in
possession
of
his
land
and
protected
rigidly
against
epidemics
like
the
influenza
of
which
ravaged
the
island
populations
wherever
infected
vessels
were
permitted
to
touch
imported
disease
exploitation
of
the
land
and
coolie
are
the
destroying
forces
from
which
the
native
must
be
preserved
if
a
shadow
of
the
old
charm
is
to
linger
for
the
enjoyment
of
future
generations
of
travelers
following
tehinatu
toward
the
house
i
thought
to
myself
how
wonderfully
the
island
charm
had
been
preserved
here
on
the
peninsula
of
taiarapu
we
were
within
fifty
miles
of
papeete
where
business
is
carried
on
and
steamers
call
and
perspiring
tourists
walk
briskly
about
the
streets
yet
here
in
this
lonely
settlement
by
the
lagoon
civilization
seemed
half
a
world
away
when
i
walked
abroad
the
sight
of
a
white
man
brought
the
people
to
their
doors
and
bands
of
children
followed
me
staring
and
bright
eyed
with
interest
on
the
veranda
children
surrounded
us
while
the
girl
cut
and
distributed
thin
slices
of
her
melon
there
is
a
fascination
in
watching
these
youngsters
brought
up
without
clothes
and
without
restraint
in
an
environment
nearly
as
friendly
as
that
of
the
original
human
pair
once
they
are
weaned
from
their
mothers
often
does
not
occur
until
they
have
reached
an
age
of
two
and
a
half
or
children
of
the
islands
are
left
practically
to
shift
for
themselves
there
is
food
in
the
house
a
place
to
sleep
and
a
scrap
of
clothing
if
the
weather
be
is
the
extent
of
parental
responsibility
the
child
eats
when
it
pleases
sleeps
when
and
where
it
will
amuses
itself
with
no
other
resources
than
its
own
as
it
grows
older
certain
light
duties
are
expected
of
fruit
lending
a
hand
with
fishing
cleaning
the
ground
about
the
the
command
to
work
is
casually
given
and
as
casually
obeyed
punishment
is
scarcely
known
yet
under
a
system
which
would
ruin
forever
an
american
or
english
child
the
brown
youngster
flourishes
with
astonishingly
little
tempered
cheerful
never
bored
and
seldom
quarrelsome
the
small
boy
tugs
at
the
net
or
gathers
bait
for
the
fishermen
seemingly
without
a
thought
of
drudgery
the
small
girl
tends
her
smaller
sister
in
the
spirit
of
playing
with
a
doll
perhaps
the
restless
and
aggressive
spirit
which
makes
discipline
necessary
in
bringing
up
our
own
children
is
the
very
quality
that
has
made
the
white
race
master
of
the
world
perhaps
the
more
hostile
surroundings
of
civilization
have
made
necessary
the
enforcement
of
prohibitory
laws
i
filled
my
pipe
and
lay
smoking
on
a
mat
with
an
eye
on
the
youngsters
at
their
play
for
the
time
being
a
little
girl
at
the
most
attractive
period
of
childhood
was
the
center
of
interest
one
of
her
front
teeth
was
loose
she
had
tied
a
bit
of
bark
to
it
and
was
summoning
up
courage
for
a
determined
pull
a
boy
stole
up
behind
her
reached
over
her
shoulder
and
gave
the
merciful
jerk
next
moment
he
was
dancing
around
her
waving
the
strip
of
bark
to
which
the
tooth
was
still
attached
the
owner
of
the
tooth
began
to
sob
holding
a
hand
over
her
mouth
but
her
lamentations
ceased
when
a
larger
boy
shouted
seriously
give
her
the
tooth
and
let
her
speak
to
the
rat
the
small
girl
trotted
to
the
edge
of
the
bush
where
i
heard
her
repeat
a
brief
invocation
before
she
flung
the
tooth
into
a
thicket
of
hibiscus
i
knew
what
she
was
saying
for
i
had
made
inquiries
concerning
this
children
s
as
old
as
it
is
quaint
it
is
a
sort
of
exchange
the
baby
tooth
is
thrown
among
the
bushes
and
the
rat
is
invoked
to
replace
it
with
one
as
white
and
durable
as
his
own
the
child
says
thy
tooth
thy
tooth
o
rat
give
to
the
man
the
tooth
the
tooth
of
the
man
i
give
to
the
rat
no
doubt
the
games
of
children
everywhere
are
very
much
the
same
in
the
islands
at
any
rate
an
american
child
would
soon
find
itself
at
home
the
boys
walk
on
stilts
play
tag
blindman
s
buff
prisoner
s
base
and
a
game
called
like
what
we
called
pewee
when
i
was
a
youngster
in
exactly
as
these
things
are
done
at
home
the
girls
play
cat
s
cradle
hopscotch
jackstones
and
joining
in
the
rougher
games
of
their
brothers
one
curious
game
evidently
modern
and
perhaps
originated
by
the
children
of
missionaries
is
called
puaa
the
game
of
the
wild
beast
the
boys
and
girls
who
pretend
to
be
sheep
stand
in
line
one
behind
the
other
clinging
together
under
the
protection
of
the
mother
ewe
at
the
head
of
the
line
presently
the
wild
beast
appears
demanding
a
victim
to
eat
you
are
the
wild
beast
the
sheep
ask
yes
he
replies
and
i
want
a
male
sheep
he
then
waits
while
the
whispers
inaudible
to
on
which
boy
for
the
beast
has
his
choice
of
sexes
shall
be
sacrificed
when
the
decision
is
made
the
mother
at
the
head
of
the
line
says
you
want
a
male
sheep
at
that
all
the
others
chant
in
unison
then
take
off
your
hat
and
take
off
your
clothes
and
strike
the
hot
iron
the
last
word
is
the
signal
for
the
victim
to
make
a
dash
for
safety
if
he
can
get
behind
the
mother
before
the
wild
beast
catches
him
the
performance
is
repeated
until
the
beast
succeeds
in
catching
another
boy
or
girl
who
then
becomes
the
the
daughter
of
airima
was
a
not
an
uncommon
thing
in
this
land
of
rapid
been
talking
for
several
days
of
piercing
her
ears
in
order
to
install
a
pair
of
earrings
to
which
she
had
fallen
heir
this
evening
she
had
finally
mustered
courage
for
the
ordeal
i
watched
her
hesitating
approach
and
saw
her
hand
tehinatu
the
necessary
cork
a
pair
of
scissors
and
a
brace
of
sharp
orange
thorns
from
which
the
green
bark
had
been
carefully
stripped
whatever
her
color
woman
s
endurance
in
the
name
of
vanity
is
proverbial
the
child
made
no
outcry
as
the
thorn
passed
through
the
lobe
of
her
ear
sank
into
the
cork
and
was
snipped
off
inside
and
out
close
to
the
remaining
section
to
be
removed
a
fortnight
later
when
the
small
wound
had
healed
as
tehinatu
smiled
at
me
and
flourished
the
scissors
to
which
clung
a
drop
of
blood
i
heard
a
shrill
call
from
the
cook
house
mai
tamaa
it
was
supper
time
some
of
the
children
in
answer
to
the
call
straggled
toward
where
airima
squatted
beside
her
oven
others
already
stuffed
with
odds
and
ends
of
fruit
went
on
with
their
play
maruae
beckoned
to
me
as
he
passed
the
meal
was
a
casual
affair
one
helped
oneself
without
ceremony
squatting
to
exchange
conversation
between
bites
or
walked
away
food
in
hand
there
were
pork
cold
fish
baked
taro
and
sections
of
breadfruit
ripe
and
delicately
cooked
the
sun
had
set
when
we
finished
and
as
the
sky
gave
promise
of
a
clear
night
i
spread
a
mat
on
the
river
bank
bedtime
in
these
places
comes
when
drowsiness
sets
in
as
i
fell
asleep
the
clouds
veiling
the
highlands
of
tahiti
nui
were
still
luminous
in
the
afterglow
it
was
midnight
when
i
awoke
in
the
house
faintly
illuminated
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
the
family
of
airima
slept
the
air
was
warm
and
scented
with
the
perfume
of
exotic
flowers
the
river
was
like
a
dark
mirror
reflecting
the
stars
even
the
pacific
seemed
to
sleep
breathing
gently
in
the
sigh
of
little
waves
dallying
with
the
bar
presently
i
became
aware
of
subdued
and
tinomana
the
chief
s
mother
were
seated
on
the
rocks
below
me
fishing
with
long
rods
of
bamboo
for
the
which
runs
in
with
the
night
tide
they
were
recalling
the
past
as
old
ladies
will
the
women
of
tahiti
remarked
tinomana
are
not
what
they
were
when
i
was
young
nowadays
you
may
travel
from
morning
till
night
without
seeing
a
really
beautiful
girl
those
are
true
words
said
airima
if
you
had
seen
my
eldest
daughter
who
died
when
she
was
fifteen
she
was
lovely
as
the
the
white
tern
which
hovers
above
the
tree
tops
her
eyes
were
brown
and
laughing
her
hair
fell
in
ringlets
to
her
knees
her
teeth
were
small
white
pearls
and
her
laughter
like
the
sound
of
cool
water
running
in
a
shady
place
alas
my
vahinetua
she
was
our
my
husband
loved
her
as
he
loved
none
of
the
others
a
strange
dreamy
child
i
used
to
watch
her
when
she
thought
herself
alone
sometimes
i
know
not
why
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
as
i
saw
her
gazing
into
the
sky
while
she
chanted
under
her
breath
the
little
old
song
the
children
sing
to
the
tern
o
itatae
sailing
above
the
still
forest
where
shall
you
fly
downwind
across
the
sea
to
tetiaroa
the
low
island
as
she
grew
older
a
wasting
illness
fell
on
her
the
doctors
could
do
nothing
to
stop
her
coughing
my
husband
even
took
her
to
the
white
doctor
in
was
on
his
recommendation
that
we
took
her
to
sea
we
were
in
mangareva
far
off
in
the
gambier
islands
when
i
saw
that
the
end
was
near
my
husband
was
not
headed
back
for
tahiti
at
once
giving
up
the
rest
of
his
trip
vahinetua
was
never
more
beautiful
than
on
the
last
morning
of
her
flushed
and
eyes
shining
soft
and
clear
as
the
first
star
of
evening
we
were
nearly
maitea
the
little
island
which
lies
between
tahiti
and
anaa
she
died
in
my
arms
and
i
covered
her
with
the
bright
patchwork
her
own
hands
had
sewn
our
child
is
dead
i
told
the
captain
her
father
as
i
came
on
deck
he
said
nothing
but
put
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
pointed
toward
the
masthead
where
i
saw
a
small
white
tern
hovering
above
us
i
can
not
tell
you
how
but
i
knew
at
once
the
soul
of
my
daughter
was
in
that
pretty
bird
it
flew
with
us
all
day
and
at
evening
as
we
entered
the
harbor
of
papeete
it
turned
back
and
disappeared
in
the
night
for
many
years
thereafter
each
time
my
husband
passed
maitea
homeward
bound
the
white
bird
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
place
where
my
daughter
had
died
the
voices
of
the
old
women
murmured
on
recalling
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
other
days
suddenly
in
a
mango
tree
behind
the
house
a
rooster
crowed
answered
far
and
near
by
others
of
his
kind
as
the
last
cry
died
in
the
silence
of
the
night
i
yielded
to
an
overpowering
drowsiness
and
fell
asleep
the
evening
was
very
warm
and
still
the
sea
rumbled
faintly
on
the
reef
half
a
mile
offshore
and
behind
the
vague
heights
of
the
full
moon
was
rising
the
palms
were
asleep
after
their
daily
tussle
with
the
drooping
and
motionless
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
we
had
spread
mats
on
the
grass
close
to
the
beach
tehinatu
lay
beside
me
chin
propped
in
her
had
been
bathing
and
her
dark
hair
still
damp
hung
in
a
cloud
about
her
face
her
grandmother
woman
of
facing
us
in
the
position
of
her
people
now
and
then
a
fish
leaped
in
the
lagoon
once
far
down
the
beach
a
ripe
nut
thudded
to
the
earth
if
you
two
like
said
old
airima
i
will
tell
you
the
story
of
my
ancestor
the
lizard
woman
the
girl
smiled
and
raised
her
head
in
the
little
gesture
which
corresponds
to
our
nod
that
is
a
good
tale
she
declared
and
true
for
i
am
named
after
that
lizard
woman
who
died
so
many
years
ago
the
woman
of
maupiti
lit
a
match
to
dry
a
leaf
of
black
tobacco
over
the
flame
when
she
had
twisted
it
in
a
strip
of
pandanus
and
inhaled
deeply
of
the
smoke
she
spoke
once
more
her
voice
was
flexible
and
soft
with
a
sweet
instrument
to
render
the
music
of
the
old
island
cadences
measured
or
rapid
falling
or
rising
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tale
in
the
old
days
airima
began
so
long
ago
that
his
name
is
now
forgotten
there
was
a
king
of
papenoo
a
just
man
successful
in
war
and
beloved
by
his
people
his
wife
was
a
daughter
of
bora
most
beautiful
woman
of
that
island
she
was
the
delight
of
his
heart
and
they
had
many
children
when
she
fell
ill
and
died
a
great
sadness
came
over
the
king
he
could
do
nothing
but
brood
over
his
loneliness
in
his
dreams
he
saw
the
face
of
his
wife
life
was
hateful
to
him
even
his
children
shouting
and
playing
about
the
house
grew
hateful
in
his
eyes
a
day
came
at
last
when
he
could
endure
the
sight
of
them
no
longer
and
a
plan
to
be
rid
of
them
took
form
in
his
mind
there
had
been
a
storm
and
he
knew
that
the
waves
would
be
running
high
at
a
place
where
there
was
a
break
in
the
reef
come
he
said
to
the
women
of
his
household
bring
my
children
to
will
hearten
me
to
see
them
sporting
in
the
but
when
they
came
to
that
beach
and
the
women
saw
the
great
waves
thundering
in
through
the
pass
they
were
afraid
for
even
a
strong
swimmer
could
not
live
in
such
a
sea
then
the
king
whose
hope
was
that
his
children
might
drown
bade
them
forget
their
fears
one
after
another
the
young
boys
and
girls
went
into
the
sea
and
were
swept
out
by
the
and
shouting
the
waves
broke
over
them
and
at
times
they
disappeared
the
women
began
to
cover
their
faces
for
they
thought
those
pretty
children
so
dear
to
us
are
as
good
as
then
the
watchers
saw
a
strange
true
thing
told
me
by
my
grandfather
who
had
learned
it
from
the
lips
of
his
ancestors
beyond
the
breaking
of
the
surf
the
children
began
to
sport
in
the
water
diving
and
leaping
higher
and
higher
into
the
air
their
skins
grew
black
and
glistened
in
the
sunlight
their
arms
turned
to
fins
and
their
feet
became
like
the
tails
of
fish
the
gods
of
those
days
had
taken
pity
on
their
innocence
and
made
of
them
the
first
playful
children
of
the
sea
and
the
king
was
glad
for
he
saw
that
his
children
would
not
die
and
he
knew
that
they
could
no
longer
come
to
his
house
to
bring
back
bitter
memories
as
the
years
went
on
the
daughters
of
many
chiefs
were
brought
to
the
king
but
no
woman
found
favor
in
his
eyes
his
heart
was
always
heavy
and
no
man
saw
him
laugh
sometimes
he
walked
alone
in
the
mountains
where
men
do
not
go
even
for
he
feared
the
ravening
spirits
of
the
dead
nor
the
lizard
people
who
in
those
days
lived
in
the
interior
of
the
island
fifty
generations
of
men
have
lived
and
died
since
our
ancestors
came
to
this
island
they
found
the
lizard
people
already
in
possession
of
the
land
ta
a
ta
moo
they
called
human
half
lizard
able
to
climb
among
the
cliffs
where
no
man
could
follow
the
human
warriors
were
more
powerful
in
battle
and
as
time
went
on
the
lizard
folk
were
driven
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
mountains
now
the
last
of
them
is
dead
but
if
you
doubt
that
they
once
lived
go
into
the
hills
and
you
will
see
the
remains
of
their
plantain
gardens
high
above
cliffs
no
human
creature
could
scale
my
own
people
are
traveling
the
same
the
last
of
us
will
also
be
dead
and
the
white
man
will
glance
at
the
scattered
stones
of
our
to
make
sure
that
once
upon
a
time
we
lived
but
i
was
telling
you
of
the
king
one
day
as
he
wandered
alone
in
the
mountains
a
lizard
woman
was
lying
in
the
fern
beside
the
head
woman
of
her
people
skilled
in
magic
and
able
to
read
the
future
this
king
was
a
tall
man
very
strong
and
handsome
as
he
passed
without
looking
down
she
seized
his
foot
gently
at
that
he
looked
down
and
his
heart
swelled
with
love
of
her
he
dwelt
with
her
in
the
mountains
and
when
at
last
he
came
down
to
the
sea
his
people
had
given
him
up
for
dead
in
due
time
a
son
was
born
to
that
lizard
strong
and
beautiful
boy
the
image
of
the
king
his
father
she
reared
him
alone
in
the
mountains
and
grew
to
love
him
better
than
her
life
but
when
she
looked
into
the
future
her
tears
fell
when
the
child
was
twelve
years
old
she
led
him
to
the
mouth
of
her
valley
and
talked
long
with
him
telling
him
what
he
was
to
do
before
she
turned
away
and
went
back
to
her
own
place
weeping
taking
thought
of
her
words
the
boy
went
alone
to
the
village
of
the
king
his
dress
was
the
skin
of
lizards
when
he
came
to
that
place
he
said
to
those
about
take
me
to
the
king
my
but
when
they
repeated
his
words
the
king
said
it
is
false
i
have
no
wife
and
no
then
the
child
sent
back
word
asking
the
king
if
he
had
forgotten
walking
one
day
in
the
mountains
many
years
before
with
that
the
king
remembered
his
love
for
the
lizard
woman
and
bade
his
men
bring
the
boy
to
him
and
when
he
saw
the
strong
fearless
child
and
heard
his
people
exclaim
at
the
beauty
of
the
boy
and
the
wondrous
likeness
to
himself
his
heart
softened
and
he
said
this
is
indeed
my
son
the
years
passed
and
the
heart
of
the
lizard
and
alone
in
the
ever
more
hungry
for
her
son
until
at
length
her
life
became
intolerable
without
sight
of
him
she
stole
down
from
the
hills
by
night
and
went
softly
about
the
village
weeping
and
lamenting
because
her
son
was
not
to
be
seen
the
people
trembled
at
sight
of
her
in
the
moonlight
and
at
the
sound
of
her
weeping
and
the
king
feared
her
for
he
knew
that
she
was
powerful
in
magic
and
thought
that
she
had
come
to
take
her
son
away
in
his
fear
he
took
canoe
with
the
young
man
and
they
went
down
the
wind
to
tetuaroa
the
low
island
where
he
thought
to
be
safe
from
her
but
the
lizard
woman
by
her
magic
knew
where
they
had
gone
she
looked
into
the
future
and
saw
only
sadness
and
death
for
herself
what
must
be
can
not
be
avoided
she
leaped
into
the
sea
and
swam
first
to
raiatea
where
she
had
lands
and
where
the
bones
of
her
ancestors
lay
in
the
when
she
came
to
that
shore
she
knew
that
her
death
was
near
and
that
she
would
die
by
the
hand
of
her
own
son
close
by
the
beach
she
stopped
to
weep
and
the
place
of
her
weeping
is
still
called
tai
nuu
iti
the
little
falling
of
tears
farther
on
her
path
she
stopped
again
to
weep
still
more
bitterly
and
to
this
day
the
name
of
that
place
is
tai
nuu
rahi
the
great
falling
of
tears
when
she
had
been
to
her
she
plunged
again
into
the
ocean
and
swam
to
all
the
islands
there
was
no
swimmer
like
her
because
of
his
mother
her
son
was
named
au
moana
swimmer
in
the
sea
the
king
and
the
king
s
son
saw
tehinatu
coming
far
tehinatu
was
the
name
of
that
lizard
they
felt
such
fear
that
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
tall
palm
then
knowing
the
manner
of
her
death
she
came
out
of
the
all
the
began
to
climb
the
palm
tree
the
two
men
trembled
with
fear
of
her
they
threw
down
coconuts
hoping
to
strike
her
so
that
she
would
fall
to
the
earth
but
though
she
was
bruised
and
her
eyes
blinded
with
tears
she
climbed
on
until
she
was
just
beneath
them
clinging
to
the
trunk
where
the
first
fronds
begin
to
branch
she
stopped
to
rest
for
a
moment
and
as
she
clung
to
the
palm
allowing
her
body
to
relax
her
son
hurled
a
heavy
nut
which
struck
her
on
the
breast
she
made
no
outcry
but
her
hands
let
go
their
hold
and
she
fell
far
down
to
the
earth
but
the
men
still
trembled
and
were
afraid
to
come
down
out
of
the
tree
for
she
struck
in
a
swampy
place
and
was
long
in
dying
all
afternoon
she
lay
there
weeping
and
lamenting
until
at
sunset
the
spirit
left
her
body
when
she
was
dead
they
took
her
to
raiatea
and
buried
her
in
her
after
that
the
two
men
returned
to
papenoo
and
when
the
king
died
the
son
of
the
lizard
woman
reigned
long
in
his
stead
these
are
true
words
for
the
blood
of
swimmer
in
the
sea
born
of
the
lizard
woman
flows
in
my
veins
old
airima
ceased
to
speak
from
the
coconut
shell
at
her
side
she
took
a
lump
of
black
native
tobacco
and
began
to
tear
off
a
leaf
for
a
fresh
cigarette
her
granddaughter
turned
on
one
resting
on
a
folded
looked
at
me
aye
those
are
true
words
she
said
for
is
my
name
not
the
same
as
that
of
the
lizard
woman
during
a
thousand
years
perhaps
tahito
since
the
women
of
our
family
have
been
called
tehinatu
you
yourself
though
we
call
you
tehari
have
a
real
name
among
moana
after
her
son
these
names
belong
to
us
no
other
family
does
well
to
use
them
the
flare
of
a
match
illuminated
for
an
instant
the
wrinkled
and
aquiline
face
of
airima
as
she
tossed
the
glowing
stick
aside
the
moonlight
smoothed
away
the
lines
i
was
aware
only
of
her
black
eyes
wonderfully
alive
and
young
tell
him
of
poia
she
suggested
and
the
dead
ones
in
robes
of
flame
said
the
girl
that
is
a
strange
tale
and
it
came
about
because
of
a
name
she
sat
up
shaking
the
hair
back
over
her
shoulders
the
woman
who
saw
these
things
she
went
on
was
another
of
our
ancestors
she
was
called
poia
a
name
her
grandfather
had
given
she
lived
at
tai
nuu
iti
in
baiatea
where
tehinatu
first
stopped
to
weep
one
day
in
midafternoon
poia
was
sitting
in
the
house
beside
her
mother
busy
with
the
weaving
of
a
mat
all
at
once
a
darkness
closed
in
before
her
eyes
and
she
felt
the
spirit
struggling
to
leap
from
her
body
it
was
like
the
pangs
of
death
but
at
last
her
spirit
was
free
and
with
its
eyes
she
saw
her
body
lying
as
if
in
sleep
and
perceived
that
there
were
strangers
in
the
women
and
a
man
the
women
were
very
lovely
with
flowers
in
their
hair
and
robes
of
scarlet
which
seemed
to
flicker
like
fire
they
were
vahinetua
and
vivitautua
ancestors
dead
many
years
before
who
loved
poia
dearly
the
man
was
likewise
dressed
in
flaming
scarlet
and
he
wore
a
tall
headdress
of
red
feathers
he
was
tanetua
another
of
poia
s
ancestors
the
three
had
come
from
the
to
seek
poia
and
they
spoke
to
her
kindly
saying
come
with
us
and
though
she
felt
shame
when
she
looked
down
at
her
dull
dress
and
disordered
hair
she
followed
where
they
led
they
took
her
to
the
of
tai
nuu
rahi
and
there
poia
saw
a
huge
woman
waiting
for
them
the
right
side
of
that
woman
was
white
and
the
left
side
black
when
she
saw
them
coming
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
began
to
weep
for
joy
is
it
you
poia
she
cried
then
welcome
as
poia
stood
there
marveling
the
stone
of
the
opened
before
her
like
the
door
of
a
great
house
and
vahinetua
and
vivitautua
said
to
her
go
the
door
gave
on
a
chamber
of
floor
was
of
stone
and
the
ceiling
and
the
walls
they
passed
through
another
door
into
a
second
empty
room
of
stone
and
thence
into
a
third
and
there
poia
chanced
to
look
down
at
herself
she
had
become
lovely
as
the
others
her
hair
was
dressed
with
flowers
and
her
robe
was
scarlet
seeming
to
flicker
like
fire
while
she
was
looking
at
herself
no
longer
ashamed
the
two
women
said
to
her
you
must
stay
here
for
you
belong
to
us
we
are
angry
with
your
grandfather
because
he
called
you
poia
that
is
not
all
of
your
true
name
is
tetuanui
poia
terai
mateatea
that
name
belongs
to
us
and
you
must
have
it
for
you
are
our
descendant
and
we
love
she
did
not
know
that
this
was
her
name
she
thought
it
was
only
poia
in
spite
of
their
kindness
she
was
frightened
and
told
them
that
she
wished
to
go
home
they
took
her
to
the
door
of
her
house
and
left
her
there
and
she
found
herself
lying
with
the
mat
in
her
fingers
her
mother
who
was
sitting
beside
her
only
said
you
have
slept
but
poia
in
fear
and
wonder
at
what
she
had
seen
said
nothing
to
her
mother
not
even
when
the
two
went
to
bathe
the
next
day
in
midafternoon
poia
again
felt
the
darkness
close
in
before
her
eyes
the
pangs
of
death
as
her
spirit
struggled
and
at
last
escaped
from
the
body
but
this
time
she
found
herself
gloriously
clothed
and
beautiful
at
once
all
went
as
before
until
they
came
to
the
third
chamber
of
the
there
were
leaves
spread
on
the
floor
of
that
place
as
if
for
a
feast
but
the
only
food
was
purple
flowers
the
others
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
and
poia
attempted
to
do
likewise
but
the
taste
of
the
flowers
was
bitter
in
her
mouth
again
the
two
women
said
you
belong
to
us
you
must
not
be
called
poia
but
tetuanui
poia
terai
and
they
coaxed
her
to
stay
with
them
but
she
wept
and
said
that
she
could
not
bear
to
be
separated
from
her
husband
whom
she
loved
as
before
they
were
kind
to
her
and
took
her
to
her
house
where
she
awoke
as
if
from
sleep
and
said
nothing
it
was
the
same
the
next
day
but
this
time
when
they
had
come
to
the
third
chamber
of
the
vehinetua
and
vivitautua
said
now
you
must
no
longer
think
of
returning
you
are
ours
and
we
wish
you
to
stay
here
with
poia
wept
at
their
words
for
she
began
to
think
of
the
man
she
loved
i
must
go
she
said
if
i
had
no
husband
i
would
gladly
remain
with
you
at
last
when
her
tears
had
fallen
for
a
long
time
the
three
dwellers
in
the
took
her
home
they
bade
her
farewell
reluctantly
saying
that
next
day
she
must
come
to
them
for
good
this
time
poia
awoke
in
great
fear
and
she
told
the
story
to
her
mother
when
they
went
to
bathe
together
her
mother
went
straight
to
the
grandfather
to
tell
him
what
she
had
seen
and
ask
him
if
her
true
name
was
poia
as
he
had
said
years
before
then
the
old
man
said
that
he
had
done
wrong
for
the
name
was
not
only
poia
but
tetuanui
poia
terai
mateatea
a
name
which
belonged
to
vahinetua
and
tanetua
and
vivitautua
and
these
three
came
no
more
to
get
poia
they
were
content
for
they
loved
her
and
wanted
her
to
have
their
name
as
she
finished
her
story
tehinatu
lay
down
once
more
resting
her
head
on
her
grandmother
s
knee
my
thoughts
were
wandering
far
a
great
ocean
and
a
the
quiet
streets
of
new
bedford
set
with
old
houses
in
which
the
descendants
of
the
whalers
live
out
their
ordered
lives
in
all
probability
the
girl
beside
me
polynesian
to
the
core
and
glorying
in
a
long
line
of
ancestors
whose
outlandish
names
fell
musically
from
her
cousins
who
lived
on
those
quiet
streets
for
she
was
the
granddaughter
of
a
new
bedford
whaling
captain
the
husband
of
puritan
who
ate
once
too
often
of
the
and
lingered
in
the
islands
to
turn
trader
and
rear
a
family
of
children
and
finally
to
die
the
story
is
an
old
one
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
every
group
the
white
cross
the
children
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
their
turning
aside
from
the
stony
path
of
the
father
s
race
to
the
pleasant
ways
of
the
mother
and
so
in
the
end
the
strain
of
white
further
diluted
with
each
succeeding
generation
shows
itself
in
nothing
more
than
a
name
seldom
used
and
oftentimes
forgotten
it
is
nature
at
work
and
she
is
not
always
cruel
is
it
the
same
with
names
in
your
land
airima
was
asking
are
certain
names
kept
in
a
family
throughout
the
years
it
is
somewhat
the
same
i
told
her
though
we
do
not
prize
names
so
highly
my
father
and
grandfather
and
his
father
were
all
named
charles
which
you
call
tehari
among
my
people
she
said
the
possession
of
a
name
means
much
as
far
back
as
our
stories
go
there
has
been
a
man
named
maruae
in
each
generation
of
my
father
s
family
some
of
these
maruaes
were
strange
men
there
was
maruae
taura
varua
ino
who
fished
with
a
bait
of
coconut
for
the
spirits
of
men
drowned
in
the
sea
and
another
was
maruae
mata
tofa
who
stole
a
famous
adopted
child
of
a
man
of
fariipiti
that
was
a
good
shark
it
lived
in
the
lagoon
harming
no
one
and
every
day
the
man
and
his
wife
called
it
to
them
with
certain
secret
words
but
maruae
coveted
the
shark
and
he
prepared
an
underwater
cave
in
the
coral
before
his
house
then
when
the
cave
was
ready
he
hid
in
the
bushes
on
the
shore
of
the
lagoon
while
the
man
was
calling
his
shark
and
in
this
way
maruae
learned
the
secret
words
of
summons
when
the
man
and
his
wife
had
gone
maruae
called
out
the
words
the
shark
appeared
close
inshore
and
followed
him
to
the
cave
where
it
stayed
well
content
and
that
night
he
taught
it
new
words
next
day
the
man
and
his
wife
called
to
their
shark
and
when
it
did
not
come
they
suspected
that
maruae
had
enticed
it
away
after
that
they
went
to
the
house
of
maruae
and
accused
him
of
the
theft
but
he
said
give
the
call
if
you
think
i
have
stolen
your
shark
i
have
a
shark
but
it
is
not
they
called
but
the
shark
did
not
come
for
he
had
taught
it
new
words
then
maruae
called
and
the
shark
came
at
once
so
he
said
see
it
must
be
my
shark
for
it
obeys
me
and
not
as
he
turned
away
to
return
to
fariipiti
the
other
man
said
i
think
it
is
my
shark
but
if
it
will
obey
you
and
no
other
you
may
have
some
days
later
a
party
of
fishermen
came
to
maruae
s
cave
where
the
shark
lived
they
baited
a
great
hook
and
threw
it
into
the
water
and
as
it
sank
into
the
cave
they
chanted
a
magic
chant
then
the
shark
seized
the
bait
and
as
they
hauled
him
out
they
laughed
with
joy
and
chanted
matau
maitai
puru
maumau
e
anave
maitai
maea
i
te
this
chant
is
something
about
a
good
hook
and
a
good
line
but
the
other
words
are
they
mean
no
man
knows
that
night
there
was
feasting
in
the
houses
of
the
fishermen
but
next
morning
when
maruae
went
down
to
the
sea
and
called
his
shark
nothing
came
though
he
stayed
by
the
lagoon
calling
from
morning
till
the
sun
had
set
after
that
he
learned
that
his
shark
had
been
killed
and
eaten
and
from
that
day
none
of
maruae
s
undertakings
prospered
finally
he
pined
away
and
died
tehinatu
stirred
and
sat
up
eyes
shining
in
the
moonlight
the
subject
of
sharks
has
for
these
people
a
fascination
we
do
not
understand
a
significance
tinged
with
the
supernatural
they
did
evil
to
kill
that
shark
she
said
for
all
sharks
are
not
bad
i
remember
the
tale
my
mother
told
me
of
viritoa
the
paumotuan
of
maruae
ouma
ati
her
god
was
a
shark
it
was
many
years
ago
when
the
vessels
of
the
white
men
were
few
in
these
islands
maruae
shipped
on
a
schooner
going
to
new
zealand
taking
his
wife
with
him
as
was
permitted
in
those
days
that
woman
was
not
like
us
she
understood
ships
and
had
no
fear
of
the
sea
as
for
swimming
there
were
few
like
her
when
she
came
here
the
women
marveled
at
her
hair
it
reached
to
her
ankles
and
she
wore
it
coiled
about
her
head
in
two
great
braids
thick
as
a
man
s
arm
the
captain
of
that
schooner
was
always
drinking
most
of
the
time
he
lay
stupefied
in
his
bed
as
they
sailed
to
the
south
the
sea
grew
worse
and
worse
but
the
captain
was
too
drunk
to
take
notice
the
men
of
the
crew
were
in
great
fear
they
had
no
confidence
in
the
mate
and
the
seas
were
like
mountain
ridges
all
about
them
the
morning
came
when
viritoa
said
to
maruae
before
nightfall
this
schooner
will
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
let
us
make
ready
rub
yourself
well
with
coconut
oil
and
i
will
braid
my
hair
and
fasten
it
tightly
about
my
toward
midday
they
were
standing
together
by
the
shrouds
when
viritoa
said
quick
leap
into
the
rigging
that
woman
knew
the
ways
of
the
sea
next
moment
a
great
wave
broke
over
the
schooner
the
decks
gave
way
and
most
of
the
were
the
death
of
rats
at
once
but
viritoa
and
her
husband
leaped
into
the
sea
before
the
vessel
went
down
a
day
and
a
night
they
were
swimming
there
were
times
when
maruae
would
have
lost
courage
if
viritoa
had
not
cheered
him
put
your
hands
on
my
shoulders
she
said
and
rest
remember
that
i
am
a
woman
of
the
low
are
as
much
at
home
in
the
sea
as
on
all
the
while
she
was
praying
to
the
shark
who
was
her
god
the
storm
had
abated
soon
after
the
schooner
went
down
next
day
the
sea
was
blue
and
very
calm
presently
when
the
sun
was
high
viritoa
said
to
her
husband
i
think
my
god
will
soon
come
to
us
put
your
head
beneath
the
water
and
tell
me
what
you
with
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
he
did
as
she
had
told
him
gazing
long
into
the
depths
below
finally
he
raised
his
head
dripping
and
when
he
had
taken
breath
he
spoke
i
see
nothing
he
said
naught
but
the
blue
salt
she
prayed
a
little
to
her
god
and
told
him
to
look
again
and
the
third
time
he
raised
his
head
with
fear
and
wonder
on
his
face
something
is
rising
in
the
sea
beneath
us
he
said
as
his
breath
came
a
great
shark
large
as
a
ship
and
bright
red
like
the
mountain
plantain
my
stomach
is
sick
with
now
i
am
content
said
the
paumotuan
woman
for
that
great
red
shark
is
my
god
have
no
he
will
eat
us
and
so
end
our
misery
or
he
will
carry
us
safely
to
next
moment
the
shark
rose
beside
them
like
the
hull
of
a
ship
floating
bottom
up
the
fin
on
his
back
stood
tall
as
a
man
then
viritoa
and
her
husband
swam
to
where
he
awaited
them
and
with
the
last
of
their
strength
they
clambered
up
his
rough
side
and
seated
themselves
one
on
each
side
of
the
fin
to
which
they
clung
for
three
days
and
three
nights
they
sat
on
the
back
of
the
shark
while
he
swam
steadily
to
the
they
might
have
died
of
thirst
but
when
there
were
squalls
of
rain
viritoa
unbound
her
hair
and
sucked
the
water
from
one
long
braid
while
maruae
drank
from
the
other
at
last
in
the
first
gray
of
dawn
they
saw
i
think
you
call
it
the
shark
took
them
close
to
the
reef
they
sprang
into
the
sea
and
the
little
waves
carried
them
ashore
without
a
scratch
as
they
lay
resting
on
the
reef
the
shark
swam
to
and
fro
close
in
as
though
awaiting
some
word
from
them
when
she
saw
this
viritoa
stood
up
and
cried
out
in
a
loud
voice
we
are
owe
our
lives
to
thee
now
go
and
we
shall
stay
here
at
those
words
the
turned
away
and
sank
into
the
sea
to
the
day
of
her
death
viritoa
never
saw
him
again
after
that
she
and
her
husband
walked
to
the
village
where
the
people
of
manitia
made
them
welcome
and
after
a
few
years
they
got
passage
on
a
schooner
back
to
maruae
s
own
land
the
soft
voice
of
the
girl
died
heard
only
the
murmur
of
the
reef
masses
of
cloud
were
gathering
about
the
peaks
above
our
heads
the
moon
was
sailing
a
clear
sky
radiant
and
serene
the
world
was
all
silver
and
gray
and
quiet
lagoon
the
shadowy
land
the
palms
like
inky
lace
against
the
moonlight
tehinatu
stifled
a
little
yawn
and
stretched
out
on
the
mat
with
the
abrupt
and
careless
manner
of
a
child
her
grandmother
tossed
away
a
cigarette
it
is
late
said
the
woman
of
maupiti
and
we
we
must
rise
at
daybreak
now
let
us
sleep
at
illustration
woodcut
off
the
on
the
third
day
of
the
homeward
voyage
the
wind
died
away
and
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
it
fell
dead
calm
when
we
were
less
than
a
mile
distant
from
the
atoll
of
pinaki
with
the
exception
of
a
small
group
of
papeete
traders
i
don
t
suppose
there
are
a
dozen
white
men
who
have
ever
heard
of
the
place
and
those
who
have
seen
it
or
set
foot
upon
it
must
be
fewer
still
it
lies
toward
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
low
archipelago
and
is
one
of
four
small
atolls
all
within
a
radius
of
thirty
miles
of
one
another
on
charts
of
that
segment
of
the
eastern
pacific
these
four
islands
are
barely
discernible
and
pinaki
the
least
of
them
appears
but
little
larger
than
the
dot
of
the
i
in
whitsunday
its
english
name
the
current
carried
us
slowly
along
the
side
of
the
island
it
was
intensely
hot
teriaa
nephew
of
miti
the
skipper
was
sluicing
the
blistered
deck
but
the
water
steamed
out
of
the
scuppers
and
in
a
moment
the
planking
was
as
dry
and
as
hot
to
the
touch
as
before
he
soon
left
off
and
took
refuge
in
the
whaleboat
which
he
covered
with
a
piece
of
canvas
i
crawled
in
with
him
but
the
suffocating
shade
was
less
endurable
than
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
tane
the
other
sailor
a
man
of
fifty
was
below
he
had
remained
there
most
of
the
time
since
our
departure
from
rutiaro
sleeping
on
a
greasy
mat
indifferent
to
the
place
was
alive
with
them
by
the
copra
bugs
which
were
a
nuisance
at
all
hours
the
stench
from
the
little
cabin
filled
almost
to
the
ceiling
with
unsacked
copra
was
terrible
and
it
was
not
much
better
on
deck
i
took
shelter
beside
miti
who
was
sitting
in
the
meager
shade
of
the
mainsail
presently
pointing
casually
toward
the
shore
he
said
you
see
him
what
he
do
there
i
saw
the
man
plainly
enough
now
that
he
was
pointed
out
to
me
standing
with
his
arms
folded
leaning
lightly
against
a
tree
i
was
limited
to
a
hasty
glance
through
my
binoculars
for
he
was
looking
toward
us
but
i
saw
that
he
was
unmistakably
white
although
his
skin
seemed
as
dark
as
that
of
a
native
he
was
barefoot
naked
to
the
waist
and
for
a
nether
garment
wore
a
pair
of
trousers
chopped
off
at
the
knee
i
too
wondered
what
a
white
man
could
be
doing
on
an
uninhabited
island
miti
knew
no
more
of
the
atoll
than
that
it
was
or
had
formerly
been
uninhabited
it
belonged
he
said
to
the
natives
of
nukatavake
which
lay
nine
miles
to
the
northwest
we
could
see
this
other
atoll
as
we
rode
to
the
light
swell
a
splotch
of
blue
haze
a
nail
s
breadth
wide
vanishing
and
reappearing
against
the
clear
line
of
the
horizon
in
two
hours
time
the
current
had
carried
us
to
the
lee
side
of
the
island
it
ran
swiftly
there
but
in
a
more
northerly
direction
so
that
we
were
forced
out
of
the
main
stream
of
it
and
drifted
gradually
into
quiet
water
near
the
shore
an
anchor
was
carried
to
the
reef
and
we
brought
up
to
within
thirty
yards
of
it
with
another
anchor
out
forward
the
schooner
was
safely
berthed
for
the
night
i
went
ashore
with
the
two
sailors
for
a
fresh
supply
of
drinking
coconuts
but
i
gave
no
help
in
collecting
them
a
fire
was
going
on
the
lagoon
beach
and
there
i
found
the
solitary
resident
frying
some
fish
before
a
small
hut
built
in
the
native
fashion
he
might
have
been
of
any
age
between
and
was
powerfully
built
with
a
body
as
finely
proportioned
as
a
polynesian
s
his
voice
was
pleasant
and
his
manner
cordial
as
he
gave
me
welcome
but
a
pair
of
the
coldest
blue
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
made
me
doubt
the
sincerity
of
it
i
felt
the
need
of
making
apologies
for
the
intrusion
adding
lamely
i
haven
t
seen
a
white
man
in
three
months
and
our
skipper
speaks
very
little
english
i
was
about
to
look
you
up
he
said
i
can
t
say
that
i
m
lonely
here
i
manage
to
get
along
without
much
companionship
but
to
be
frank
i
m
hungry
for
tobacco
there
s
none
left
at
nukatavake
and
i
ve
been
sucking
an
empty
pipe
since
last
november
you
haven
t
a
fill
in
your
pouch
by
any
chance
i
would
have
given
something
for
his
relish
of
the
first
pipeful
or
the
fifth
for
that
matter
finally
he
said
i
imagine
you
are
in
for
several
days
of
pinaki
you
have
noticed
the
sky
not
a
sign
of
wind
i
can
t
offer
you
much
in
the
way
of
food
but
the
fishing
is
good
and
if
you
care
to
you
are
welcome
to
stop
ashore
i
accepted
the
invitation
gladly
but
as
i
walked
back
to
the
schooner
for
a
few
belongings
and
some
more
tobacco
i
questioned
the
propriety
of
my
decision
my
prospective
host
was
an
englishman
by
his
accent
although
like
my
friend
crichton
at
tanso
he
was
evidently
long
away
from
home
he
struck
me
as
being
a
good
deal
of
the
crichton
type
although
he
differed
greatly
from
him
outwardly
i
remembered
that
crichton
too
had
been
pleasant
and
friendly
once
the
ice
was
broken
between
us
but
the
prospect
of
an
early
parting
and
the
certitude
of
our
never
meeting
again
had
been
the
basis
for
the
friendship
in
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
this
other
englishman
was
not
living
on
an
uninhabited
atoll
because
of
a
liking
for
companionship
i
was
debating
the
matter
of
a
return
to
shore
when
tane
crawled
out
of
the
cabin
to
make
preparations
for
supper
and
as
he
was
a
sufferer
from
elephantiasis
the
sight
of
his
immense
swollen
limbs
and
his
greasy
sweating
body
decided
me
papeete
was
far
distant
and
i
would
have
enough
of
tane
before
we
reached
the
end
of
the
journey
supper
was
ready
by
the
time
i
reached
the
hut
it
consisted
of
fish
deliciously
broiled
coconuts
and
hard
biscuit
over
it
i
gave
my
host
an
account
of
my
stay
at
rutiaro
and
of
the
unsuccessful
experiment
in
solitude
yes
he
said
they
are
rather
too
sociable
these
natives
the
people
of
nukatavake
used
to
bother
me
a
good
deal
when
i
first
came
here
i
thought
nine
miles
of
open
sea
would
keep
them
away
but
they
often
came
over
in
sailing
dozen
or
two
at
a
time
when
the
wind
favored
and
they
would
stay
until
it
shifted
back
into
the
southeast
i
didn
t
encourage
them
in
fact
i
made
it
quite
plain
that
i
preferred
to
be
alone
the
island
is
theirs
of
course
and
i
can
t
prevent
them
from
coming
during
the
season
but
they
no
longer
come
at
other
times
nine
months
out
of
the
year
i
have
the
place
to
myself
but
they
are
damnably
inquisitive
i
don
t
like
kanakas
in
the
aggregate
although
i
have
one
or
two
good
friends
among
them
the
dying
fire
lit
us
to
bed
about
midnight
i
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
after
my
host
was
sleeping
we
had
talked
for
three
hours
chiefly
about
the
islands
in
fact
all
that
he
told
me
of
himself
was
that
he
was
fond
of
fishing
there
was
not
a
hint
of
a
breeze
the
next
day
nor
the
next
nor
the
day
after
that
the
sea
was
almost
as
calm
as
the
lagoon
and
the
lay
motionless
at
anchor
as
though
frozen
in
a
sheet
of
clear
ice
miti
and
the
two
sailors
remained
on
board
most
of
the
time
sleeping
during
the
heat
of
the
day
under
a
piece
of
canvas
rigged
over
the
main
beam
and
at
night
fishing
over
the
side
in
dreamy
contentment
if
they
came
ashore
at
all
it
was
only
for
a
few
moments
and
they
never
crossed
to
the
lagoon
beach
during
these
three
days
i
remained
the
englishman
s
guest
and
although
i
was
out
of
patience
with
myself
for
my
curiosity
it
grew
in
spite
of
me
what
under
the
sun
was
the
man
doing
here
evidently
he
had
not
come
to
an
atoll
as
my
friend
crichton
had
to
do
his
writing
and
thinking
undisturbed
crichton
had
books
a
practical
interest
in
planting
and
a
cultural
interest
in
polynesian
dialects
he
would
muse
for
hours
over
a
word
in
one
dialect
which
might
or
might
not
bear
a
remote
resemblance
to
some
other
word
in
usage
a
thousand
miles
away
the
study
fascinated
him
as
he
once
told
me
it
gave
his
imagination
room
to
work
in
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
made
up
for
himself
stories
of
the
early
polynesian
migrations
vastly
better
than
any
romances
he
might
have
read
this
other
englishman
had
no
books
not
so
much
as
a
scrap
of
writing
paper
at
least
i
saw
none
in
his
house
which
was
as
bare
as
it
was
clean
there
was
a
sleeping
mat
in
one
corner
a
chest
and
some
fishing
gear
against
the
wall
picks
and
shovels
in
a
corner
a
few
old
clothes
hanging
from
nails
driven
into
the
supports
and
absolutely
nothing
else
how
did
he
put
in
his
time
fishing
was
a
healthy
interest
but
it
was
not
enough
to
keep
a
man
sane
for
a
period
of
seven
years
he
let
that
bit
of
information
slip
in
one
conversation
i
had
with
him
he
was
not
a
taciturn
chap
after
our
first
evening
he
talked
quite
freely
about
his
earlier
adventures
he
had
spent
three
years
in
northern
australia
prospecting
for
gold
and
he
gave
me
an
intensely
interesting
account
of
the
aborigines
their
marvelous
skill
at
following
a
trail
no
matter
over
what
sort
of
country
i
had
heard
that
these
people
were
biologically
different
from
the
rest
of
humankind
and
that
their
blood
would
not
cross
with
white
blood
this
was
not
the
case
he
said
he
had
known
white
men
animal
enough
to
take
the
australian
blacks
for
wives
and
had
seen
the
children
which
they
had
by
them
from
australia
he
had
gone
to
new
guinea
still
prospecting
for
gold
although
at
times
he
sought
relief
from
the
disappointment
of
it
by
making
expeditions
with
the
natives
in
search
of
feathers
but
gold
was
the
word
that
rang
through
all
his
talk
several
times
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
but
there
s
no
gold
at
pinaki
i
was
able
to
resist
the
temptation
remembering
his
remark
about
the
damnable
inquisitiveness
of
the
people
of
nukatavake
then
on
the
morning
of
my
third
day
on
the
island
an
incident
occurred
which
made
the
situation
clear
illustration
chapter
xvi
tailpiece
englishman
s
i
rose
at
dawn
but
my
host
was
out
before
me
he
had
left
two
fish
cleaned
and
ready
for
cooking
on
a
plate
outside
the
door
having
breakfasted
i
started
on
a
walk
around
the
atoll
which
i
estimated
i
could
accomplish
in
about
an
hour
i
expected
to
meet
the
englishman
somewhere
on
the
way
and
i
did
find
him
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
lagoon
the
shore
was
there
he
had
a
rod
in
his
hand
and
was
diving
off
a
ledge
of
rock
remaining
below
for
as
long
as
a
full
minute
he
waved
when
he
saw
me
but
kept
on
with
his
work
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
came
over
to
where
i
was
standing
tiresome
work
he
said
i
need
a
blow
then
you
see
i
ve
been
doing
a
bit
of
digging
here
i
had
walked
along
the
lagoon
beach
and
had
not
noticed
before
the
series
of
trenches
higher
up
the
land
i
should
think
he
had
been
digging
i
inspected
the
ditches
under
his
guidance
there
were
three
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
each
and
from
three
to
four
feet
deep
these
ran
in
parallel
lines
and
were
about
four
paces
apart
fifteen
to
twenty
shorter
trenches
cut
through
them
at
right
angles
the
sun
was
well
above
the
horizon
we
lit
our
pipes
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
after
a
few
moments
of
silence
he
said
i
suppose
you
know
what
i
m
doing
here
if
you
have
been
in
papeete
you
must
have
heard
there
is
no
secret
about
least
not
any
longer
i
said
that
i
had
left
papeete
shortly
after
my
arrival
i
had
spent
several
idle
afternoons
on
the
veranda
of
the
bougainville
club
but
in
the
talk
which
went
around
there
i
didn
t
remember
having
heard
of
pinaki
so
much
the
better
he
said
yes
seven
years
is
a
long
time
and
i
m
not
keen
about
feeding
gossip
but
when
i
first
came
down
here
there
was
a
clacking
of
tongues
from
one
end
of
the
group
to
the
other
i
believe
i
have
since
earned
the
reputation
of
being
rather
queer
i
thought
you
must
know
the
fact
is
i
m
looking
for
treasure
would
you
care
to
hear
the
story
very
much
i
said
if
it
won
t
bore
you
to
tell
it
on
the
contrary
it
will
be
something
of
a
relief
seven
years
of
digging
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
must
strike
an
outsider
as
a
mad
business
sometimes
i
m
half
persuaded
that
i
am
a
complete
fool
to
go
on
with
the
search
but
you
can
t
possibly
know
the
fascination
of
it
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
i
came
here
as
you
see
for
yourself
it
s
not
much
of
an
island
and
to
know
that
there
is
a
treasure
of
more
than
three
million
pounds
buried
somewhere
in
this
tiny
circle
of
scrub
and
but
do
you
know
it
i
asked
i
m
as
sure
of
it
as
that
i
am
smoking
your
tobacco
that
is
i
am
sure
it
was
buried
here
whether
it
has
been
removed
since
i
can
t
say
of
course
the
natives
at
nukatavake
remember
a
white
man
whom
they
called
luta
who
came
here
about
twenty
years
ago
and
remained
for
something
over
a
month
one
of
the
four
men
who
stole
the
gold
and
brought
it
to
pinaki
was
a
man
named
luke
barrett
and
it
may
have
been
he
who
came
back
although
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
killed
in
australia
forty
years
ago
it
is
the
uncertainty
which
makes
this
such
killing
work
at
times
but
when
i
think
of
giving
it
would
have
to
live
with
the
thought
of
treasure
for
seven
years
and
to
dream
at
night
of
finding
it
before
you
could
understand
he
rose
suddenly
if
you
don
t
mind
a
short
walk
i
will
show
you
something
rather
interesting
we
went
along
the
lagoon
beach
for
several
hundred
yards
then
crossed
toward
the
ocean
side
near
the
center
of
the
island
we
came
upon
an
immense
block
of
coral
broken
from
the
reef
and
carried
there
by
some
great
storm
of
the
past
cut
deeply
into
the
face
of
the
rock
i
saw
a
curious
design
illustration
design
i
asked
what
it
meant
man
if
i
knew
that
i
believe
it
s
the
key
and
i
can
t
master
it
but
we
may
as
well
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
if
you
would
really
care
to
hear
the
story
from
the
beginning
it
will
take
the
better
part
of
an
hour
i
ll
not
give
you
all
the
details
but
when
i
have
finished
you
will
be
in
a
position
to
judge
for
yourself
whether
or
not
i
was
mad
in
coming
here
have
you
ever
read
walker
s
book
it
doesn
t
matter
except
that
you
have
missed
a
very
entertaining
volume
it
is
a
pity
that
old
work
is
out
of
print
nothing
in
it
but
bare
facts
about
all
sorts
of
treasure
supposed
to
have
been
buried
here
and
there
about
the
world
you
might
think
it
would
be
dry
but
i
found
it
better
company
than
any
romance
i
ve
ever
read
however
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
story
except
in
an
indirect
way
i
first
read
the
book
as
a
boy
and
it
started
me
on
my
travels
to
me
the
facts
about
this
pinaki
treasure
are
as
interesting
as
any
of
walker
s
he
of
course
knew
nothing
about
it
for
it
had
not
been
stolen
when
his
book
was
published
four
men
had
a
hand
in
the
business
a
spaniard
named
alvarez
an
irishman
named
killorain
and
two
others
of
uncertain
nationality
luke
barrett
whom
i
spoke
of
a
moment
ago
and
archer
brown
they
were
a
thieving
murdering
lot
by
all
of
the
worst
sort
and
in
hope
of
plunder
i
suppose
had
joined
the
peruvian
army
during
the
war
with
chile
in
eighteen
to
sixty
their
hopes
were
realized
beyond
all
expectations
they
got
wind
of
some
gold
buried
under
the
floor
of
a
church
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
the
gold
was
there
and
they
found
it
it
was
in
ingots
contained
in
seven
chests
the
whole
lot
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
and
a
half
million
pounds
how
they
managed
to
get
away
with
it
i
don
t
know
but
i
have
investigated
the
business
pretty
thoroughly
and
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
they
did
they
buried
it
again
in
the
vicinity
of
pisco
and
then
set
out
in
search
of
a
vessel
alvarez
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
who
had
any
education
they
had
all
followed
the
sea
at
one
time
or
another
but
he
alone
knew
how
to
navigate
the
others
could
hardly
write
their
own
names
at
panama
they
signed
on
as
members
of
the
crew
of
a
small
schooner
and
as
soon
as
they
had
put
to
sea
knocked
the
captain
and
the
two
other
sailors
in
the
head
and
chucked
them
overboard
they
returned
to
pisco
loaded
the
gold
and
started
for
paumotus
this
was
in
the
autumn
of
eighteen
in
the
december
following
they
landed
at
pinaki
where
they
buried
the
treasure
the
island
was
uninhabited
then
as
now
and
they
crossed
to
nukatavake
to
learn
the
name
of
it
the
natives
were
shy
but
they
persuaded
one
man
to
approach
and
when
they
had
the
information
they
wanted
shot
him
and
rowed
out
to
their
boat
if
you
should
go
to
nukatavake
you
will
find
two
old
men
there
who
still
remember
the
incident
then
they
went
to
australia
scuttled
their
vessel
not
far
from
cooktown
and
went
ashore
with
a
story
of
shipwreck
they
had
some
of
the
gold
with
much
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
the
treasure
but
enough
to
keep
four
ordinary
men
in
comfort
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
it
soon
went
and
the
four
were
next
heard
of
at
the
palmer
gold
fields
alvarez
and
barrett
were
both
supposed
to
have
been
killed
there
in
a
fight
with
some
blacks
brown
and
killorain
had
not
mended
their
ways
to
any
extent
and
both
were
finally
jerked
up
for
manslaughter
and
sentenced
to
twenty
years
penal
servitude
brown
died
in
prison
but
killorain
served
out
his
term
and
finally
died
in
sydney
hospital
in
nineteen
twelve
most
of
these
they
are
had
from
killorain
himself
the
night
before
he
died
i
met
him
in
a
curious
way
or
better
the
meeting
came
as
the
result
of
a
curious
combination
of
circumstances
you
may
have
noticed
the
scar
on
my
side
i
had
noticed
it
a
broad
gash
puckered
at
the
edges
where
the
flesh
had
healed
tapering
to
a
point
in
the
middle
of
his
back
it
was
not
much
of
a
wound
he
went
on
but
it
gave
me
a
deal
of
trouble
at
the
time
i
got
it
in
new
guinea
in
nineteen
eleven
when
i
was
prospecting
for
gold
in
the
back
country
i
was
a
long
way
from
a
settlement
and
one
day
a
nigger
took
it
into
his
head
to
stick
me
with
a
spear
i
suppose
he
wanted
my
gun
and
ammunition
for
i
had
little
else
excepting
my
placer
outfit
i
let
him
have
one
bullet
from
my
colt
just
as
he
was
about
to
dive
into
the
bush
and
for
all
i
know
he
may
be
lying
there
to
this
day
i
have
that
little
frizzly
headed
native
to
thank
for
my
knowledge
of
the
pinaki
treasure
sometimes
i
am
sorry
that
i
killed
him
but
at
other
times
i
feel
that
shooting
was
altogether
too
easy
a
death
for
the
man
really
responsible
for
bringing
me
here
i
was
in
a
bad
way
from
the
wound
infection
set
in
and
i
had
to
nurse
myself
somehow
and
get
down
to
a
place
where
i
could
have
medical
attention
i
managed
it
but
the
ten
days
journey
was
a
nightmare
i
was
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
when
i
left
the
hospital
and
new
guinea
not
being
a
likely
place
for
a
convalescent
the
doctor
recommended
me
to
go
to
australia
i
had
a
small
bag
of
dust
the
result
of
a
year
and
a
half
of
work
in
the
mountains
most
of
it
went
for
the
hospital
bill
and
when
i
reached
sydney
i
had
very
little
left
i
was
compelled
to
put
up
at
the
cheapest
kind
of
a
boarding
house
although
the
woman
who
kept
it
was
quite
a
decent
sort
her
house
was
in
a
poor
quarter
of
the
town
and
her
patrons
mostly
longshoremen
and
teamsters
it
was
a
wretched
life
for
her
but
she
had
two
children
to
support
and
was
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
i
admired
her
pluck
and
did
what
i
could
in
a
small
way
to
help
her
out
one
evening
i
was
waiting
for
supper
in
the
kitchen
when
some
one
rapped
before
i
could
go
to
the
door
it
opened
and
an
old
man
came
stumbling
in
asking
for
something
to
eat
i
thought
he
was
drunk
and
was
about
to
hustle
him
back
the
way
he
came
when
i
noticed
that
he
was
wet
was
a
cold
rainy
really
suffering
from
exposure
and
lack
of
food
i
made
him
remove
his
had
nothing
on
under
not
without
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
he
insisted
on
drying
it
across
his
knees
he
was
a
little
wizened
ape
of
an
irishman
about
five
feet
three
or
four
in
height
with
blue
eyes
bushy
eyebrows
a
heavy
discolored
mustache
and
a
thick
shock
of
white
the
most
little
dwarf
that
ever
escaped
out
of
a
picture
book
he
was
tatooed
all
over
the
arms
and
across
the
sea
the
union
jack
a
naked
other
designs
common
in
waterfront
tatooing
parlors
his
body
was
as
shriveled
as
a
withered
apple
but
his
little
bloodshot
eyes
blazed
like
bits
of
live
coal
except
for
the
fire
in
them
he
might
have
been
a
hundred
years
old
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
wasn
t
a
great
way
from
it
he
told
me
and
that
is
about
all
he
did
tell
me
he
gorged
some
food
and
was
all
for
getting
away
at
once
but
it
had
set
in
to
rain
very
hard
and
i
persuaded
him
to
wait
until
the
worst
of
it
was
over
he
was
very
suspicious
at
first
i
believe
he
expected
me
to
call
a
policeman
later
he
thawed
a
little
and
became
even
talkative
in
a
surly
way
when
i
told
him
with
the
landlady
s
consent
that
he
might
stay
the
night
if
he
had
no
place
else
to
go
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
though
he
said
he
had
a
job
as
night
watchman
at
bay
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
true
at
any
rate
i
went
with
him
to
the
car
boarding
house
was
a
good
mile
from
gave
him
a
couple
of
shillings
as
a
loan
i
said
he
could
return
it
sometime
just
before
i
left
him
he
asked
for
my
name
and
address
mumbling
something
about
doing
me
a
bit
of
good
one
of
these
days
he
was
insistent
so
i
gave
it
to
him
but
not
at
all
willingly
he
had
frightened
sharpe
the
landlady
just
by
the
way
he
looked
at
her
and
i
didn
t
want
him
coming
back
he
didn
t
come
back
that
was
in
may
nineteen
twelve
and
i
heard
nothing
more
of
him
until
september
i
was
still
at
the
boarding
house
getting
slowly
better
but
not
yet
good
for
anything
i
kept
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
took
long
walks
in
the
country
and
along
the
waterfront
looking
at
ships
when
i
came
in
one
evening
sharpe
told
me
that
an
attendant
from
the
sydney
hospital
had
called
twice
during
the
day
an
old
man
named
killorain
a
patient
at
the
hospital
wanted
to
see
me
the
name
meant
nothing
to
me
and
i
couldn
t
imagine
who
the
man
could
be
the
attendant
called
again
later
in
the
evening
killorain
was
about
to
die
he
said
and
wouldn
t
give
them
any
peace
until
i
was
brought
to
see
him
it
was
getting
on
toward
midnight
when
we
reached
the
hospital
the
old
man
was
in
one
of
the
public
wards
i
recognized
him
at
once
although
he
had
shriveled
away
to
nothing
at
all
it
was
impossible
to
forget
his
eyes
once
you
had
seen
them
he
was
doubt
of
it
but
i
could
see
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
die
until
he
was
ready
sit
down
close
here
he
said
i
m
glad
you
came
you
did
me
a
good
turn
once
and
i
haven
t
forgot
it
few
good
turns
i
ve
had
in
my
life
not
so
many
but
what
i
can
remember
the
the
night
nurse
had
approached
quietly
and
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
all
at
once
he
saw
her
hey
you
he
said
grease
off
out
of
this
stand
over
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
i
can
watch
you
when
she
had
gone
he
rose
from
his
pillow
and
looked
cautiously
around
the
room
the
beds
on
either
side
of
him
were
empty
there
was
a
patient
in
the
one
across
the
aisle
but
he
was
sleeping
killorain
watched
him
for
a
moment
to
make
sure
of
this
then
he
motioned
me
with
his
finger
to
come
still
closer
listen
he
said
i
ve
cut
more
throats
in
my
time
than
you
might
sounds
a
bit
stagey
doesn
t
it
but
these
were
his
exact
words
nothing
remarkable
about
them
of
course
is
still
a
fairly
thriving
business
i
waited
for
him
to
go
on
he
again
looked
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
asked
me
to
hand
him
the
coat
which
was
lying
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
was
the
same
coat
he
had
been
wearing
in
may
when
he
came
to
the
boarding
house
when
they
brought
me
here
he
said
they
took
my
clothes
and
i
ve
had
some
trouble
getting
this
the
attendant
had
told
me
as
much
the
old
man
had
raised
the
very
devil
of
a
row
until
it
was
found
he
asked
me
to
rip
open
the
lining
of
the
right
sleeve
and
to
give
him
the
paper
i
would
find
there
it
was
a
soiled
greasy
sheet
of
foolscap
pasted
on
a
piece
of
cloth
once
he
went
on
you
gave
me
two
shillings
for
car
fare
to
bay
it
probably
wasn
t
any
hardship
on
you
but
never
mind
about
that
you
said
i
could
pay
it
back
if
i
d
a
mind
to
well
i
m
going
to
pay
it
back
with
a
bit
of
interest
i
m
going
to
give
you
this
paper
and
it
s
as
good
as
three
million
pound
notes
of
the
bank
of
i
thought
of
course
that
he
was
completely
off
his
chump
and
the
fear
that
i
would
think
so
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
kept
repeating
that
he
was
old
and
worn
out
but
that
his
mind
was
clear
don
t
you
think
i
m
balmy
he
said
i
know
what
i
m
talking
about
as
well
as
i
know
i
m
going
to
die
before
he
gave
me
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
whole
affair
i
have
outlined
it
briefly
there
were
many
other
interesting
facts
but
it
is
not
worth
while
to
speak
of
them
here
as
he
talked
the
conviction
grew
upon
me
that
he
was
perfectly
sane
and
was
telling
the
truth
he
went
over
the
chart
with
me
it
had
been
made
by
alvarez
the
scholar
of
the
party
he
said
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
quarreling
and
fighting
later
for
the
possession
of
it
before
i
left
him
he
made
me
promise
that
i
would
go
to
pinaki
he
wouldn
t
rest
easy
in
his
grave
he
said
unless
he
knew
that
i
was
looking
for
the
treasure
it
s
there
and
it
will
always
be
there
if
you
re
bloody
fool
enough
to
think
i
m
queer
it
ain
t
likely
i
d
lie
to
you
on
my
rest
easy
in
his
grave
there
was
an
odd
glimpse
into
his
mind
he
wasn
t
worrying
about
his
crimes
and
there
were
enough
of
them
according
to
his
own
confession
it
was
the
thought
of
the
gold
lying
forever
forgotten
which
worried
him
he
could
rest
quietly
if
he
knew
before
he
died
that
some
one
else
was
fighting
and
over
it
i
asked
him
why
he
hadn
t
gone
back
for
it
himself
he
told
me
that
of
the
years
since
it
had
been
buried
he
had
spent
forty
in
prison
and
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
trying
to
earn
or
steal
the
money
to
buy
a
schooner
i
told
him
that
i
would
come
back
to
see
him
the
following
day
you
needn
t
bother
he
said
i
m
and
it
was
true
he
died
three
hours
later
i
tried
to
forget
the
incident
but
it
was
one
of
those
things
which
refuse
to
be
forgotten
it
was
always
in
the
back
of
my
head
i
decided
to
check
up
killorain
s
story
where
i
could
i
made
inquiries
in
peru
and
found
that
the
gold
had
actually
been
stolen
the
dates
and
circumstances
coincided
with
his
account
a
friend
in
the
customs
at
cooktown
confirmed
for
me
the
story
of
four
shipwrecked
sailors
who
landed
in
february
eighteen
sixty
from
a
ship
called
the
i
had
a
small
piece
of
property
on
the
outskirts
of
cooktown
which
i
had
bought
years
ago
with
the
money
realized
from
the
sale
of
it
i
took
passage
for
tahiti
on
my
way
to
pinaki
that
voyage
was
the
longest
one
i
have
ever
made
by
that
time
the
thought
of
those
seven
chests
of
gold
all
in
ingots
was
with
me
hours
out
of
the
yes
even
at
night
i
slept
very
little
and
when
i
did
it
was
to
dream
of
hunting
for
the
treasure
of
finding
it
i
became
suspicious
of
a
old
man
who
was
traveling
third
class
i
thought
he
might
be
brown
or
luke
barrett
perhaps
they
were
not
dead
after
all
at
papeete
i
told
no
one
of
my
purpose
there
with
the
exception
of
one
governmental
official
if
the
treasure
should
be
found
the
french
government
would
have
a
claim
to
certain
percentage
on
uncoined
gold
and
i
meant
to
be
aboveboard
in
my
dealings
with
it
this
official
was
sworn
to
secrecy
but
the
business
leaked
out
eventually
and
created
a
great
deal
of
excitement
i
was
immensely
annoyed
of
course
for
i
had
guarded
the
secret
as
well
as
old
killorain
ever
had
however
i
had
in
my
pocket
all
the
necessary
papers
drawn
up
accurately
witnessed
signed
and
sealed
i
went
on
with
my
preparations
and
finally
in
february
nineteen
thirteen
i
was
put
ashore
from
a
small
cutter
not
four
hundred
yards
from
where
we
are
sitting
i
started
the
search
before
the
cutter
was
two
miles
on
the
return
voyage
for
two
months
i
slept
in
the
no
time
to
build
a
ate
tinned
food
which
i
had
brought
with
me
killorain
s
chart
was
of
but
little
use
it
made
reference
to
trees
which
had
long
since
rotted
away
or
had
been
cut
down
by
the
natives
of
nukatavake
the
marks
which
i
found
corresponded
precisely
with
those
on
the
chart
but
several
of
the
most
important
ones
were
missing
the
treasure
hunter
rose
well
he
said
there
s
the
end
of
the
story
you
know
the
rest
of
it
but
i
don
t
know
the
rest
at
all
i
said
you
have
left
out
the
most
interesting
part
tell
me
something
of
your
life
here
you
have
seen
three
days
of
it
it
has
gone
on
for
seven
years
in
the
same
way
you
were
diving
just
now
in
the
lagoon
do
you
think
the
gold
may
have
been
buried
there
or
that
the
land
has
fallen
away
my
dear
fellow
i
ll
not
weary
you
with
an
account
of
what
i
think
it
s
rather
warm
here
shall
we
go
back
to
the
house
i
was
hoping
for
a
week
of
calm
and
when
we
went
to
bed
that
evening
there
was
reason
to
believe
we
might
have
it
a
few
hours
later
however
i
was
awakened
by
the
englishman
there
s
going
to
be
a
bit
of
a
blow
presently
he
said
your
skipper
has
just
sent
for
you
he
wants
to
get
away
at
once
the
stars
had
been
blotted
out
the
wind
was
soughing
in
the
palms
and
the
waves
slapping
briskly
on
the
lagoon
beach
our
farewell
was
a
brief
one
when
shall
you
come
to
tahiti
i
asked
not
until
i
have
found
what
i
m
looking
for
well
i
said
i
hope
that
will
be
soon
but
if
he
holds
fast
to
his
resolve
my
belief
is
that
it
will
be
never
illustration
woodcut
the
i
was
awaiting
hall
s
arrival
in
tahiti
confident
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
keep
a
vague
rendezvous
set
months
before
i
knew
that
by
this
time
he
must
have
penetrated
far
into
the
sea
of
atolls
traveling
in
the
leisurely
manner
of
these
latitudes
transferring
from
one
schooner
to
the
next
and
stopping
weeks
at
a
time
the
tranquil
and
lonely
communities
he
had
grown
to
love
once
or
a
dingy
paumotu
schooner
deep
laden
with
copra
and
crowded
with
pearl
divers
eager
for
a
whirl
of
gayety
in
the
island
capital
crept
into
the
had
word
of
him
but
there
was
no
hint
of
return
it
was
a
month
of
calms
long
days
when
the
lagoon
unruffled
by
the
faintest
cat
shimmered
in
the
blinding
sunlight
while
the
sea
outside
seemed
to
slumber
stirring
gently
and
drowsily
along
the
reef
once
at
midday
a
schooner
with
all
sails
furled
and
diesel
engines
going
came
in
to
waken
the
town
with
the
hoarse
clamor
of
her
exhaust
an
hour
later
i
met
her
skipper
on
the
street
your
friend
hall
is
homeward
bound
he
told
me
i
spoke
the
a
bit
of
a
native
schooner
off
nukatavake
and
he
was
aboard
of
ought
to
be
in
some
time
this
week
the
days
passed
in
the
rapid
and
dreamy
fashion
peculiar
to
the
south
seas
from
time
to
time
i
thought
of
hall
and
his
diminutive
schooner
drifting
about
becalmed
among
the
coral
islands
or
perhaps
only
a
score
of
miles
off
tahiti
helpless
to
reach
the
sighted
land
the
was
a
full
week
overdue
when
the
calm
weather
came
to
an
end
the
heat
was
intense
that
afternoon
and
toward
sunset
towering
masses
of
cloud
began
to
pile
up
along
the
horizon
to
the
north
the
sky
grew
black
there
was
a
tense
hush
in
the
air
vibrant
with
the
rumble
of
thunder
when
i
strolled
out
along
the
waterfront
the
people
were
gathering
in
anxious
groups
before
their
houses
i
heard
snatches
of
talk
have
you
noticed
the
glass
things
have
an
ugly
look
hope
it
doesn
t
mean
another
cyclone
the
town
will
catch
it
if
the
sea
begins
to
rise
i
had
heard
of
the
hurricane
of
when
the
sea
rose
and
reached
clean
into
the
harbor
driving
the
population
of
papeete
to
the
hills
on
motu
uta
an
islet
in
the
bay
a
white
man
was
living
with
his
paumotuan
wife
when
the
angry
seas
began
to
race
in
over
the
reef
without
a
pause
sweeping
the
islet
from
end
to
end
the
watchers
ashore
gave
the
pair
up
for
lost
but
the
woman
was
a
and
just
before
dawn
when
the
coconut
palm
in
which
she
had
taken
refuge
was
swept
away
she
swam
six
hundred
yards
to
shore
and
landed
through
a
surf
a
sea
otter
would
have
hesitated
to
attempt
next
day
they
found
the
drowned
and
battered
body
of
her
husband
drifting
with
dead
pigs
and
horses
and
a
litter
of
wreckage
from
the
lower
portions
of
the
town
possibly
tahiti
was
in
for
another
hurricane
when
i
glanced
at
my
barometer
after
dinner
it
was
falling
with
ominous
rapidity
and
at
bedtime
the
glass
stood
lower
than
i
had
seen
it
in
the
south
seas
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
a
servant
came
to
waken
me
there
was
a
new
sound
in
the
uproar
of
surf
breaking
on
the
inner
shore
of
the
lagoon
the
sea
is
rising
said
tara
the
waves
are
breaking
under
the
trees
and
if
you
do
not
come
quickly
to
help
me
our
canoe
will
be
washed
away
the
stars
were
hidden
by
black
clouds
and
though
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
level
of
the
lagoon
was
four
feet
above
its
normal
limit
and
the
sheltered
water
usually
so
calm
was
agitated
by
a
heavy
swell
then
the
rain
a
thunderous
monotone
on
my
tin
after
the
rain
the
wind
at
dawn
though
a
gale
was
blowing
out
of
the
northeast
it
was
obvious
that
ali
danger
of
a
hurricane
was
past
at
midday
the
glass
began
to
rise
and
before
dark
the
wind
was
falling
away
perceptibly
more
than
once
during
the
night
i
had
thought
of
hall
out
somewhere
on
the
wild
and
lonely
sea
to
the
east
the
was
reputed
an
able
little
proper
offing
she
would
probably
come
through
worse
than
this
but
she
had
no
engine
and
if
she
had
been
caught
in
the
dangerous
archipelago
where
unknown
currents
and
a
maze
of
reefs
make
navigation
ticklish
in
the
best
of
was
cause
for
anxiety
the
storm
blew
itself
out
in
two
days
time
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
i
was
standing
on
the
water
front
with
a
group
of
traders
and
schooner
captains
they
were
speaking
of
the
by
this
time
the
object
of
mild
misgivings
when
one
of
the
skippers
gave
a
sudden
shout
there
she
is
now
he
announced
and
looking
up
i
saw
a
deeply
laden
little
schooner
with
patched
grayish
sails
rounding
the
point
of
fareute
presently
she
turned
into
the
wind
dropped
anchor
and
sent
a
boat
few
moments
later
i
was
welcoming
thin
raggedly
dressed
and
brown
as
a
paumotuan
his
eyes
were
smiling
but
they
had
in
them
a
look
unmistakable
when
once
expression
of
a
hunger
greater
than
most
of
us
have
known
hello
he
said
come
along
to
the
must
be
dinner
time
by
jove
i
feel
as
though
i
could
eat
a
raw
shark
when
he
had
eaten
two
dinners
soup
to
black
coffee
and
beginning
with
soup
lit
a
cigarette
and
told
me
the
story
of
his
return
from
the
low
islands
it
was
all
right
he
began
until
we
left
hao
the
palm
tops
were
still
in
sight
on
the
horizon
when
the
breeze
died
away
and
we
drifted
for
seven
whole
days
in
a
broiling
glassy
calm
it
was
a
curious
experience
but
one
i
would
not
care
to
repeat
you
ve
seen
the
s
not
much
bigger
than
a
canoe
there
were
four
of
us
the
skipper
a
paumotuan
and
a
seaman
by
instinct
though
he
knows
nothing
of
latitude
of
longitude
two
sailors
one
of
whom
has
a
horrible
case
of
elephantiasis
and
myself
we
had
a
tremendous
load
of
copra
for
so
small
a
boat
the
hold
was
crammed
with
it
and
the
cabin
stuffed
to
the
ceiling
opposite
the
companionway
they
had
left
out
a
few
bags
at
the
top
giving
a
space
two
feet
high
and
just
wide
enough
for
two
men
to
sleep
side
by
side
in
case
of
rain
or
bad
weather
our
stove
was
merely
a
box
of
sand
in
which
a
fire
could
be
lighted
set
in
a
little
box
of
a
galley
tacked
to
the
forward
deck
if
we
had
had
anything
to
cook
the
galley
might
have
been
useful
but
miti
had
given
away
nearly
all
of
the
ship
s
provisions
to
his
relatives
on
hao
they
gave
him
a
feast
while
some
copra
was
being
loaded
and
when
the
job
was
finished
he
gave
a
feast
in
return
the
two
sailors
looked
sour
while
they
watched
the
people
opening
their
biscuit
and
salmon
and
but
after
all
the
prevailing
winds
are
fair
and
normally
the
passage
to
tahiti
wouldn
t
take
more
than
ten
days
miti
overdid
the
business
however
when
we
took
stock
of
our
on
the
first
day
of
the
calm
i
found
he
had
saved
only
half
a
tin
of
biscuit
and
a
few
cans
of
salmon
in
addition
to
this
we
had
a
parting
gift
of
a
sack
of
drinking
nuts
and
a
couple
of
dozen
ripe
nuts
some
one
was
sending
to
tahiti
for
seed
i
had
grown
fed
up
on
the
sort
of
water
these
schooners
and
full
of
wriggling
young
by
great
good
fortune
i
had
a
sent
by
tino
of
the
which
i
filled
with
fresh
rain
water
at
hao
my
demijohn
lasted
precisely
a
day
and
a
half
all
hands
drank
out
of
it
but
i
did
not
complain
of
their
was
supposed
to
be
a
barrel
of
water
somewhere
below
those
were
thirsty
days
we
rigged
up
an
awning
with
part
of
an
old
mainsail
i
spent
most
of
my
time
lying
in
the
hot
shade
reading
the
one
book
i
had
with
s
of
england
france
and
the
days
seemed
interminable
the
starlight
paled
the
sun
rose
to
glare
down
hour
after
hour
on
the
face
of
a
motionless
and
empty
sea
and
set
at
last
on
a
horizon
void
of
clouds
sometimes
i
dozed
sometimes
i
watched
the
reflections
of
the
bowsprit
it
was
painted
gray
with
a
seen
in
the
faintly
heaving
water
it
looked
like
a
long
gray
snake
spitting
fire
as
it
writhed
in
graceful
undulations
the
sufferer
from
elephantiasis
turned
out
to
be
an
extraordinary
man
it
was
not
worth
while
to
keep
watches
during
the
calm
and
as
there
was
no
work
of
any
importance
he
retired
to
the
stifling
among
the
copra
sacks
and
from
dawn
to
darkness
and
from
dark
to
dawn
again
now
and
then
at
long
intervals
he
appeared
on
deck
once
i
went
aft
for
a
look
at
him
lying
naked
except
for
a
open
and
swollen
limbs
sprawled
on
the
uneven
surface
of
the
copra
miti
and
teriaa
showed
a
different
side
of
native
character
the
schooner
belonged
to
the
captain
and
keeping
her
trim
gave
him
the
same
delight
a
man
feels
in
buying
pretty
clothes
for
his
mistress
the
young
sailor
was
miti
s
nephew
and
the
pair
of
them
worked
tirelessly
in
the
sun
scraping
her
rail
and
topsides
in
preparation
for
a
fresh
coat
of
paint
it
was
strange
when
i
was
deep
in
froissart
s
sieges
and
battles
and
stories
of
court
life
to
glance
up
from
my
book
and
see
the
vacant
rim
of
the
horizon
the
silhouette
of
the
foremast
against
a
hot
blue
sky
and
the
two
kanakas
endlessly
at
scrape
scrape
an
exchange
of
remarks
a
chuckle
as
they
heard
the
gentle
snores
of
the
sleeping
man
below
nearly
every
day
our
hopes
were
raised
by
deceitful
cat
heralded
by
streaks
of
blue
some
died
before
they
reached
us
others
after
a
preliminary
rustle
and
flutter
filled
our
sails
and
set
the
schooner
to
moving
gently
on
her
course
only
to
die
away
and
leave
the
sea
glassy
as
before
on
the
second
day
the
sharks
began
to
gather
in
their
uncanny
fashion
as
they
always
do
about
a
vessel
becalmed
or
in
distress
i
spent
hours
watching
blots
in
the
clear
blue
water
waiting
with
a
grim
and
hopeful
patience
for
some
happening
which
would
provide
them
with
a
meal
they
circled
about
the
schooner
in
deliberate
zigzags
or
lay
motionless
in
the
shadow
of
her
side
attended
always
by
their
odd
little
striped
pilot
fish
i
learned
to
recognize
one
ponderous
old
gray
shark
he
had
a
brace
of
pilot
fish
one
swimming
on
each
side
of
his
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
us
in
the
least
sometimes
he
lay
for
an
hour
within
a
yard
of
the
vessel
s
side
i
could
see
the
texture
of
his
rough
skin
and
the
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
fins
and
tail
i
can
understand
now
the
hatred
sharks
inspire
in
men
who
follow
the
wasn
t
long
before
i
decided
to
try
to
kill
the
big
insolent
brute
we
hadn
t
as
much
as
a
hook
and
line
on
board
but
finally
with
a
file
and
the
point
of
a
rusty
boat
hook
i
improvised
a
makeshift
sort
of
spear
armed
with
this
i
waited
by
the
rail
until
my
victim
came
in
range
and
then
lunged
down
with
all
my
strength
the
spear
glanced
off
his
tough
hide
he
swam
away
in
a
leisurely
manner
turned
and
a
moment
later
was
again
beneath
me
this
time
i
struck
him
fair
on
the
back
but
it
was
like
trying
to
kill
an
elephant
with
a
penknife
i
think
the
point
of
my
boat
hook
punctured
him
but
he
only
circled
off
again
and
returned
to
give
me
another
chance
in
the
end
i
gave
up
and
left
him
in
possession
of
the
field
the
nights
when
the
air
had
cooled
and
the
stars
were
blazing
overhead
were
so
beautiful
that
one
hated
to
fall
asleep
reflection
made
sky
and
sea
backgrounds
for
the
myriad
lights
of
the
constellations
lying
on
deck
while
the
others
slept
i
used
to
regret
that
i
had
not
learned
something
of
average
native
sailor
knows
more
about
the
stars
than
orion
i
knew
the
pleiades
which
the
natives
with
a
rather
pretty
fancy
call
matariki
the
little
eyes
and
the
scorpion
believed
in
heathen
times
to
be
the
great
fish
hook
of
maui
flung
into
the
sky
by
the
god
when
he
had
finished
pulling
up
islands
from
the
bottom
of
the
pacific
each
night
i
watched
the
rising
of
the
southern
cross
and
low
down
in
the
south
i
saw
the
magellanic
clouds
streamers
of
star
dust
like
vapor
impalpable
and
remote
in
spite
of
my
companions
sleeping
quietly
on
deck
those
nights
gave
me
a
sense
of
overwhelming
loneliness
the
languid
air
the
solitary
ship
immobile
on
the
face
of
a
lifeless
sea
the
immense
expanse
of
the
universe
ablaze
with
the
light
of
distant
suns
when
our
water
gave
out
i
began
to
prefer
the
nights
to
the
days
my
demijohn
as
i
told
you
lasted
only
a
day
and
a
half
after
that
we
used
the
drinking
nuts
and
not
until
the
last
of
them
was
gone
did
anyone
think
of
investigating
the
water
cask
there
was
consternation
when
we
discovered
that
it
contained
only
three
or
four
inches
of
rusty
it
leaked
or
the
skipper
was
remarkably
careless
hoping
all
the
time
for
a
breeze
or
a
squall
of
rain
we
began
on
the
half
sack
of
ripe
sharp
stuff
for
drinking
but
the
lot
of
them
went
in
a
day
then
we
went
on
rations
dealt
out
from
the
barrel
with
a
soup
spoon
finally
the
barrel
was
dry
and
we
went
two
days
with
nothing
of
any
kind
to
drink
it
was
no
you
ve
ever
had
a
real
thirst
you
ll
know
what
i
mean
the
natives
stood
it
wonderfully
well
miti
did
not
once
complain
though
he
remarked
to
me
that
when
he
got
ashore
he
was
planning
to
drink
too
much
coconut
the
victim
of
continued
his
slumberous
wondered
if
he
were
dreaming
of
rustling
palms
and
shaded
gurgling
rivulets
it
was
my
first
experience
of
thirst
odd
what
an
utter
animal
one
becomes
at
such
a
time
waking
and
sleeping
my
head
was
filled
with
dreams
of
water
brooks
rivers
lakes
of
cool
fresh
water
in
which
to
bury
one
s
face
and
drink
i
dreamed
of
locks
and
highland
burns
in
scotland
of
the
gorge
of
fautaua
on
tahiti
where
only
a
few
months
before
i
had
stood
in
the
mist
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
cataract
well
it
wasn
t
much
day
or
two
might
have
been
unendurable
we
had
one
comfort
at
any
you
re
thirsty
enough
you
don
t
worry
about
eating
by
the
time
we
had
finished
the
salmon
and
biscuit
we
had
ceased
to
bother
about
food
on
the
last
night
of
the
calm
none
of
us
slept
unless
it
was
the
sailor
in
his
den
among
the
copra
sacks
at
dawn
miti
touched
my
shoulder
and
pointed
to
the
south
where
the
paling
stars
were
obscured
by
banks
of
cloud
an
hour
later
the
rain
water
was
streaming
out
of
the
scuppers
and
spouting
off
one
end
of
our
awning
into
the
barrel
hastily
recoopered
in
case
of
leaks
when
the
squall
passed
and
the
sun
shone
down
on
a
leaping
sea
we
were
running
before
a
fine
breeze
from
the
southeast
now
that
our
thirst
was
satisfied
and
we
had
plenty
of
water
in
reserve
we
discovered
suddenly
that
we
were
starving
miti
prowled
about
below
and
came
on
deck
with
a
package
of
rice
stowed
away
during
some
previous
voyage
it
was
a
valuable
find
for
we
had
nothing
else
to
eat
there
was
copra
of
course
which
the
natives
will
eat
in
a
pinch
but
the
rancid
smell
of
the
stuff
was
too
much
for
me
the
wind
held
and
finally
a
day
came
when
the
skipper
announced
that
we
ought
to
raise
tahiti
soon
about
midday
his
nephew
who
was
perched
in
the
shrouds
sang
out
that
he
had
sighted
land
i
had
a
look
and
saw
on
the
horizon
a
flat
blur
like
the
palm
tops
of
a
distant
atoll
as
we
drew
near
the
land
rose
higher
and
higher
out
of
the
was
makatea
and
we
were
more
than
a
hundred
miles
north
of
our
course
no
meal
i
have
ever
eaten
tasted
so
good
as
the
dinner
miti
s
relatives
gave
us
that
night
we
got
away
next
morning
with
a
liberal
stock
of
provisions
and
an
additional
passenger
for
philosophic
pig
who
traveled
lashed
under
one
of
the
seats
of
the
ship
s
boat
for
three
hours
we
ran
before
a
fresh
northwesterly
breeze
but
about
nine
o
clock
the
wind
dropped
and
soon
the
sails
were
hanging
limp
in
a
dead
calm
i
began
to
suspect
that
the
man
with
the
swollen
legs
was
a
jonah
of
the
first
order
this
time
however
the
calm
was
soon
over
heavy
clouds
were
drifting
down
on
us
from
the
north
the
sunlight
gave
place
to
an
evil
violet
gloom
miti
and
his
two
men
sprang
into
a
sudden
activity
they
battened
down
the
forward
hatch
put
extra
lashings
on
the
boat
the
foresail
and
got
in
everything
else
then
in
the
breathless
calm
a
downpour
of
rain
began
to
lash
the
sea
with
a
strange
murmuring
sound
i
thought
of
an
ominous
old
verse
if
the
wind
before
the
rain
sheet
your
topsails
home
again
if
the
rain
before
the
wind
then
your
topsail
halyards
mind
it
was
a
disagreeable
moment
even
the
pig
felt
it
for
when
the
sailors
moved
him
to
a
place
in
the
bow
of
the
dory
he
refrained
from
the
usual
shrill
protest
one
detail
sticks
in
my
the
skipper
had
taken
his
place
at
the
wheel
he
gave
a
sudden
order
the
man
with
the
swollen
legs
shuffled
hastily
to
where
the
boat
was
lashed
down
and
pulled
out
the
plug
from
its
bottom
then
came
the
wind
it
swept
down
on
us
from
the
from
the
quarter
in
which
hurricanes
the
first
furious
gust
was
a
mild
sample
of
what
was
to
come
when
miti
got
her
laid
to
heading
at
a
slight
angle
into
the
seas
i
realized
the
splendid
qualities
of
the
little
no
small
vessel
could
have
kept
her
decks
dry
in
the
sea
that
made
up
within
an
hour
the
captain
never
left
the
wheel
and
i
doubt
if
there
s
a
finer
helmsman
in
the
south
seas
but
before
noon
the
our
entire
supply
of
food
was
swept
clean
overboard
and
time
after
time
the
boat
was
filled
the
pig
had
worked
himself
free
except
for
one
hind
leg
tied
to
a
bottom
board
with
a
rough
strip
of
hibiscus
bark
and
as
the
water
drained
out
slowly
through
the
unplugged
hole
astern
the
agitated
surface
would
be
broken
by
his
snout
emitting
sputtering
screams
he
lived
through
it
by
the
way
all
of
us
i
believe
thought
that
we
were
in
for
a
hurricane
every
hour
the
violence
of
the
wind
increased
it
was
a
gale
from
the
wind
called
by
the
ancient
polynesians
the
terrible
maoake
it
seemed
to
rush
at
us
in
paroxysms
of
fury
tearing
off
the
entire
crests
of
waves
and
hurling
solid
water
about
as
though
it
were
spray
the
forward
hatch
leaked
badly
when
i
think
of
that
storm
my
memory
is
filled
with
a
nightmare
of
endless
pumping
a
day
and
a
night
passed
and
dawn
found
us
riding
a
mountainous
sea
but
the
wind
was
abating
and
our
decks
were
dry
the
victim
of
elephantiasis
had
been
taking
spells
with
me
at
the
pump
he
is
a
man
that
fellow
in
spite
of
his
loathsome
infirmity
the
pump
began
to
suck
up
bubbles
and
froth
miti
s
eyes
are
sharp
enough
pumping
he
shouted
go
and
sleep
you
two
we
obeyed
the
order
with
alacrity
sleeping
on
deck
was
out
of
the
question
without
an
instant
of
hesitation
i
crawled
in
among
the
copra
sacks
beside
my
repulsive
companion
when
i
awoke
it
was
evening
and
we
were
running
with
a
heavy
following
wind
miti
was
still
at
the
helm
red
eyed
from
want
of
sleep
but
whirling
the
spokes
dexterously
as
each
big
sea
passed
beneath
us
and
gazing
ahead
for
the
first
glimpse
of
tahiti
the
clouds
broke
just
before
dark
and
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
high
ridges
of
taiarapu
dead
ahead
we
got
sail
on
her
at
that
and
stood
off
to
the
northwest
past
the
bay
of
taravao
and
the
sunken
reefs
of
hitiaa
toward
morning
we
raised
point
venus
light
but
the
wind
failed
in
the
lee
of
the
island
and
it
took
us
all
day
to
reach
papeete
harbor
hall
finished
his
story
in
the
dark
the
last
of
the
diners
had
gone
long
since
and
save
for
ourselves
the
broad
veranda
was
empty
what
are
your
plans
i
asked
our
year
in
the
south
seas
is
up
where
are
you
going
now
i
have
no
plans
he
said
except
that
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
go
north
again
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
believe
i
ve
had
enough
of
civilization
to
last
