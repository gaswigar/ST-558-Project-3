preface
this
volume
written
in
as
a
sequel
to
the
same
mont
saint
michel
and
chartres
was
privately
printed
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
copies
in
and
sent
to
the
persons
interested
for
their
assent
correction
or
suggestion
the
idea
of
the
two
books
was
thus
explained
at
the
end
of
chapter
xxix
any
schoolboy
could
see
that
man
as
a
force
must
be
measured
by
motion
from
a
fixed
point
psychology
helped
here
by
suggesting
a
unit
the
point
of
history
when
man
held
the
highest
idea
of
himself
as
a
unit
in
a
unified
universe
eight
or
ten
years
of
study
had
led
adams
to
think
he
might
use
the
century
expressed
in
amiens
cathedral
and
the
works
of
thomas
aquinas
as
the
unit
from
which
he
might
measure
motion
down
to
his
own
time
without
assuming
anything
as
true
or
untrue
except
relation
the
movement
might
be
studied
at
once
in
philosophy
and
mechanics
setting
himself
to
the
task
he
began
a
volume
which
he
mentally
knew
as
and
chartres
a
study
of
unity
from
that
point
he
proposed
to
fix
a
position
for
himself
which
he
could
label
education
of
henry
adams
a
study
of
multiplicity
with
the
help
of
these
two
points
of
relation
he
hoped
to
project
his
lines
forward
and
backward
indefinitely
subject
to
correction
from
any
one
who
should
know
better
the
chartres
was
finished
and
privately
printed
in
the
education
proved
to
be
more
difficult
the
point
on
which
the
author
failed
to
please
himself
and
could
get
no
light
from
readers
or
friends
was
the
usual
one
of
literary
form
probably
he
saw
it
in
advance
for
he
used
to
say
half
in
jest
that
his
great
ambition
was
to
complete
augustine
confessions
but
that
augustine
like
a
great
artist
had
worked
from
multiplicity
to
unity
while
he
like
a
small
one
had
to
reverse
the
method
and
work
back
from
unity
to
multiplicity
the
scheme
became
unmanageable
as
he
approached
his
end
probably
he
was
in
fact
trying
only
to
work
into
it
his
favorite
theory
of
history
which
now
fills
the
last
three
or
four
chapters
of
the
education
and
he
could
not
satisfy
himself
with
his
workmanship
at
all
events
he
was
still
pondering
over
the
problem
in
when
he
tried
to
deal
with
it
in
another
way
which
might
be
more
intelligible
to
students
he
printed
a
small
volume
called
a
letter
to
american
teachers
which
he
sent
to
his
associates
in
the
american
historical
association
hoping
to
provoke
some
response
before
he
could
satisfy
himself
even
on
this
minor
point
a
severe
illness
in
the
spring
of
put
an
end
to
his
literary
activity
forever
the
matter
soon
passed
beyond
his
control
in
the
institute
of
architects
published
the
and
chartres
already
the
education
had
become
almost
as
well
known
as
the
chartres
and
was
freely
quoted
by
every
book
whose
author
requested
it
the
author
could
no
longer
withdraw
either
volume
he
could
no
longer
rewrite
either
and
he
could
not
publish
that
which
he
thought
unprepared
and
unfinished
although
in
his
opinion
the
other
was
historically
purposeless
without
its
sequel
in
the
end
he
preferred
to
leave
the
education
unpublished
avowedly
incomplete
trusting
that
it
might
quietly
fade
from
memory
according
to
his
theory
of
history
as
explained
in
chapters
xxxiii
and
xxxiv
the
teacher
was
at
best
helpless
and
in
the
immediate
future
silence
next
to
was
the
mark
of
sense
after
midsummer
the
rule
was
made
absolute
the
massachusetts
historical
society
now
publishes
the
education
as
it
was
printed
in
with
only
such
marginal
corrections
as
the
author
made
and
it
does
this
not
in
opposition
to
the
author
judgment
but
only
to
put
both
volumes
equally
within
reach
of
students
who
have
occasion
to
consult
them

jean

began
his
famous
confessions
by
a
vehement
appeal
to
the
deity

myself
as
i
was
contemptible
and
vile
when
i
was
so

when

unveiled

interior

as

collect
about
me
the
innumerable
swarm
of
my
fellows
let
them
hear
my
confessions
let
them
groan
at
my
unworthiness
let
them
blush
at
my
meannesses
let
each
of
them
discover
his
heart
in
his
turn
at
the
foot
of
thy
throne
with
the
same
sincerity
and
then
let
any
one
of
them
tell
thee
if
he
dares
was
a
better
man
jean
jacques
was
a
very
great
educator
in
the
manner
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
has
been
commonly
thought
to
have
had
more
influence
than
any
other
teacher
of
his
time
but
his
peculiar
method
of
improving
human
nature
has
not
been
universally
admired
most
educators
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
declined
to
show
themselves
before
their
scholars
as
objects
more
vile
or
contemptible
than
necessary
and
even
the
humblest
teacher
hides
if
possible
the
faults
with
which
nature
has
generously
embellished
us
all
as
it
did
jean
jacques
thinking
as
most
religious
minds
are
apt
to
do
that
the
eternal
father
himself
may
not
feel
unmixed
pleasure
at
our
thrusting
under
his
eyes
chiefly
the
least
agreeable
details
of
his
creation
as
an
unfortunate
result
the
twentieth
century
finds
few
recent
guides
to
avoid
or
to
follow
american
literature
offers
scarcely
one
working
model
for
high
education
the
student
must
go
back
beyond
jean
jacques
to
benjamin
franklin
to
find
a
model
even
of
except
in
the
abandoned
sphere
of
the
dead
languages
no
one
has
discussed
what
part
of
education
has
in
his
personal
experience
turned
out
to
be
useful
and
what
not
this
volume
attempts
to
discuss
it
as
educator
jean
jacques
was
in
one
respect
easily
first
he
erected
a
monument
of
warning
against
the
ego
since
his
time
and
largely
thanks
to
him
the
ego
has
steadily
tended
to
efface
itself
and
for
purposes
of
model
to
become
a
manikin
on
which
the
toilet
of
education
is
to
be
draped
in
order
to
show
the
fit
or
misfit
of
the
clothes
the
object
of
study
is
the
garment
not
the
figure
the
tailor
adapts
the
manikin
as
well
as
the
clothes
to
his
patron
wants
the
tailor
object
in
this
volume
is
to
fit
young
men
in
universities
or
elsewhere
to
be
men
of
the
world
equipped
for
any
emergency
and
the
garment
offered
to
them
is
meant
to
show
the
faults
of
the
patchwork
fitted
on
their
fathers
at
the
utmost
the
young
man
should
ask
of
his
teacher
only
mastery
of
his
tools
the
young
man
himself
the
subject
of
education
is
a
certain
form
of
energy
the
object
to
be
gained
is
economy
of
his
force
the
training
is
partly
the
clearing
away
of
obstacles
partly
the
direct
application
of
effort
once
acquired
the
tools
and
models
may
be
thrown
away
the
manikin
therefore
has
the
same
value
as
any
other
geometrical
figure
of
three
or
more
dimensions
which
is
used
for
the
study
of
relation
for
that
purpose
it
can
not
be
spared
it
is
the
only
measure
of
motion
of
proportion
of
human
condition
it
must
have
the
air
of
reality
must
be
taken
for
real
must
be
treated
as
though
it

possibly
it

february
a
child
was
born
and
christened
later
by
his
uncle
the
minister
of
the
first
church
after
the
tenets
of
boston
unitarianism
as
henry
brooks
adams
had
he
been
born
in
jerusalem
under
the
shadow
of
the
temple
and
circumcised
in
the
synagogue
by
his
uncle
the
high
priest
under
the
name
of
israel
cohen
he
would
scarcely
have
been
more
distinctly
branded
and
not
much
more
heavily
handicapped
in
the
races
of
the
coming
century
in
running
for
such
stakes
as
the
century
was
to
offer
but
on
the
other
hand
the
ordinary
traveller
who
does
not
enter
the
field
of
racing
finds
advantage
in
being
so
to
speak
ticketed
through
life
with
the
safeguards
of
an
old
established
traffic
safeguards
are
often
irksome
but
sometimes
convenient
and
if
one
needs
them
at
all
one
is
apt
to
need
them
badly
a
hundred
years
earlier
such
safeguards
as
his
would
have
secured
any
young
success
and
although
in
their
value
was
not
very
great
compared
with
what
they
would
have
had
in
yet
the
mere
accident
of
starting
a
career
from
a
nest
of
associations
so
colonial
so
troglodytic
as
the
first
church
the
boston
state
house
beacon
hill
john
hancock
and
john
adams
mount
vernon
street
and
quincy
all
crowding
on
ten
pounds
of
unconscious
babyhood
was
so
queer
as
to
offer
a
subject
of
curious
speculation
to
the
baby
long
after
he
had
witnessed
the
solution
what
could
become
of
such
a
child
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
when
he
should
wake
up
to
find
himself
required
to
play
the
game
of
the
twentieth
had
he
been
consulted
would
he
have
cared
to
play
the
game
at
all
holding
such
cards
as
he
held
and
suspecting
that
the
game
was
to
be
one
of
which
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
back
to
the
beginning
of
time
knew
the
rules
or
the
risks
or
the
stakes
he
was
not
consulted
and
was
not
responsible
but
had
he
been
taken
into
the
confidence
of
his
parents
he
would
certainly
have
told
them
to
change
nothing
as
far
as
concerned
him
he
would
have
been
astounded
by
his
own
luck
probably
no
child
born
in
the
year
held
better
cards
than
he
whether
life
was
an
honest
game
of
chance
or
whether
the
cards
were
marked
and
forced
he
could
not
refuse
to
play
his
excellent
hand
he
could
never
make
the
usual
plea
of
irresponsibility
he
accepted
the
situation
as
though
he
had
been
a
party
to
it
and
under
the
same
circumstances
would
do
it
again
the
more
readily
for
knowing
the
exact
values
to
his
life
as
a
whole
he
was
a
consenting
contracting
party
and
partner
from
the
moment
he
was
born
to
the
moment
he
died
only
with
that
understanding
as
a
consciously
assenting
member
in
full
partnership
with
the
society
of
his
age
had
his
education
an
interest
to
himself
or
to
others
as
it
happened
he
never
got
to
the
point
of
playing
the
game
at
all
he
lost
himself
in
the
study
of
it
watching
the
errors
of
the
players
but
this
is
the
only
interest
in
the
story
which
otherwise
has
no
moral
and
little
incident
a
story
of
education
seventy
years
of
it
the
practical
value
remains
to
the
end
in
doubt
like
other
values
about
which
men
have
disputed
since
the
birth
of
cain
and
abel
but
the
practical
value
of
the
universe
has
never
been
stated
in
dollars
although
every
one
can
not
be
a
and
walk
off
with
the
great
bells
of
notre
dame
every
one
must
bear
his
own
universe
and
most
persons
are
moderately
interested
in
learning
how
their
neighbors
have
managed
to
carry
theirs
this
problem
of
education
started
in
went
on
for
three
years
while
the
baby
grew
like
other
babies
unconsciously
as
a
vegetable
the
outside
world
working
as
it
never
had
worked
before
to
get
his
new
universe
ready
for
him
often
in
old
age
he
puzzled
over
the
question
whether
on
the
doctrine
of
chances
he
was
at
liberty
to
accept
himself
or
his
world
as
an
accident
no
such
accident
had
ever
happened
before
in
human
experience
for
him
alone
the
old
universe
was
thrown
into
the
and
a
new
one
created
he
and
his
troglodytic
boston
were
suddenly
cut
apart
separated
forever
in
act
if
not
in
sentiment
by
the
opening
of
the
boston
and
albany
railroad
the
appearance
of
the
first
cunard
steamers
in
the
bay
and
the
telegraphic
messages
which
carried
from
baltimore
to
washington
the
news
that
henry
clay
and
james
polk
were
nominated
for
the
presidency
this
was
in
may
he
was
six
years
old
his
new
world
was
ready
for
use
and
only
fragments
of
the
old
met
his
eyes
of
all
this
that
was
being
done
to
complicate
his
education
he
knew
only
the
color
of
yellow
he
first
found
himself
sitting
on
a
yellow
kitchen
floor
in
strong
sunlight
he
was
three
years
old
when
he
took
this
earliest
step
in
education
a
lesson
of
color
the
second
followed
soon
a
lesson
of
taste
on
december
he
developed
scarlet
fever
for
several
days
he
was
as
good
as
dead
reviving
only
under
the
careful
nursing
of
his
family
when
he
began
to
recover
strength
about
january
his
hunger
must
have
been
stronger
than
any
other
pleasure
or
pain
for
while
in
after
life
he
retained
not
the
faintest
recollection
of
his
illness
he
remembered
quite
clearly
his
aunt
entering
the
sickroom
bearing
in
her
hand
a
saucer
with
a
baked
apple
the
order
of
impressions
retained
by
memory
might
naturally
be
that
of
color
and
taste
although
one
would
rather
suppose
that
the
sense
of
pain
would
be
first
to
educate
in
fact
the
third
recollection
of
the
child
was
that
of
discomfort
the
moment
he
could
be
removed
he
was
bundled
up
in
blankets
and
carried
from
the
little
house
in
hancock
avenue
to
a
larger
one
which
his
parents
were
to
occupy
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
the
neighboring
mount
vernon
street
the
season
was
midwinter
january
and
he
never
forgot
his
acute
distress
for
want
of
air
under
his
blankets
or
the
noises
of
moving
furniture
as
a
means
of
variation
from
a
normal
type
sickness
in
childhood
ought
to
have
a
certain
value
not
to
be
classed
under
any
fitness
or
unfitness
of
natural
selection
and
especially
scarlet
fever
affected
boys
seriously
both
physically
and
in
character
though
they
might
through
life
puzzle
themselves
to
decide
whether
it
had
fitted
or
unfitted
them
for
success
but
this
fever
of
henry
adams
took
greater
and
greater
importance
in
his
eyes
from
the
point
of
view
of
education
the
longer
he
lived
at
first
the
effect
was
physical
he
fell
behind
his
brothers
two
or
three
inches
in
height
and
proportionally
in
bone
and
weight
his
character
and
processes
of
mind
seemed
to
share
in
this
process
of
scale
he
was
not
good
in
a
fight
and
his
nerves
were
more
delicate
than
boys
nerves
ought
to
be
he
exaggerated
these
weaknesses
as
he
grew
older
the
habit
of
doubt
of
distrusting
his
own
judgment
and
of
totally
rejecting
the
judgment
of
the
world
the
tendency
to
regard
every
question
as
open
the
hesitation
to
act
except
as
a
choice
of
evils
the
shirking
of
responsibility
the
love
of
line
form
quality
the
horror
of
ennui
the
passion
for
companionship
and
the
antipathy
to
society
all
these
are
qualities
of
new
england
character
in
no
way
peculiar
to
individuals
but
in
this
instance
they
seemed
to
be
stimulated
by
the
fever
and
henry
adams
could
never
make
up
his
mind
whether
on
the
whole
the
change
of
character
was
morbid
or
healthy
good
or
bad
for
his
purpose
his
brothers
were
the
type
he
was
the
variation
as
far
as
the
boy
knew
the
sickness
did
not
affect
him
at
all
and
he
grew
up
in
excellent
health
bodily
and
mental
taking
life
as
it
was
given
accepting
its
local
standards
without
a
difficulty
and
enjoying
much
of
it
as
keenly
as
any
other
boy
of
his
age
he
seemed
to
himself
quite
normal
and
his
companions
seemed
always
to
think
him
so
whatever
was
peculiar
about
him
was
education
not
character
and
came
to
him
directly
and
indirectly
as
the
result
of
that
inheritance
which
he
took
with
his
name
the
atmosphere
of
education
in
which
he
lived
was
colonial
revolutionary
almost
cromwellian
as
though
he
were
steeped
from
his
greatest
grandmother
birth
in
the
odor
of
political
crime
resistance
to
something
was
the
law
of
new
england
nature
the
boy
looked
out
on
the
world
with
the
instinct
of
resistance
for
numberless
generations
his
predecessors
had
viewed
the
world
chiefly
as
a
thing
to
be
reformed
filled
with
evil
forces
to
be
abolished
and
they
saw
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
had
wholly
succeeded
in
the
abolition
the
duty
was
unchanged
that
duty
implied
not
only
resistance
to
evil
but
hatred
of
it
boys
naturally
look
on
all
force
as
an
enemy
and
generally
find
it
so
but
the
new
englander
whether
boy
or
man
in
his
long
struggle
with
a
stingy
or
hostile
universe
had
learned
also
to
love
the
pleasure
of
hating
his
joys
were
few
politics
as
a
practice
whatever
its
professions
had
always
been
the
systematic
organization
of
hatreds
and
massachusetts
politics
had
been
as
harsh
as
the
climate
the
chief
charm
of
new
england
was
harshness
of
contrasts
and
extremes
of
sensibility
a
cold
that
froze
the
blood
and
a
heat
that
boiled
it
so
that
the
pleasure
of
hating
one
self
if
no
better
victim
offered
was
not
its
rarest
amusement
but
the
charm
was
a
true
and
natural
child
of
the
soil
not
a
cultivated
weed
of
the
ancients
the
violence
of
the
contrast
was
real
and
made
the
strongest
motive
of
education
the
double
exterior
nature
gave
life
its
relative
values
winter
and
summer
cold
and
heat
town
and
country
force
and
freedom
marked
two
modes
of
life
and
thought
balanced
like
lobes
of
the
brain
town
was
winter
confinement
school
rule
discipline
straight
gloomy
streets
piled
with
six
feet
of
snow
in
the
middle
frosts
that
made
the
snow
sing
under
wheels
or
runners
thaws
when
the
streets
became
dangerous
to
cross
society
of
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
who
expected
children
to
behave
themselves
and
who
were
not
always
gratified
above
all
else
winter
represented
the
desire
to
escape
and
go
free
town
was
restraint
law
unity
country
only
seven
miles
away
was
liberty
diversity
outlawry
the
endless
delight
of
mere
sense
impressions
given
by
nature
for
nothing
and
breathed
by
boys
without
knowing
it
boys
are
wild
animals
rich
in
the
treasures
of
sense
but
the
new
england
boy
had
a
wider
range
of
emotions
than
boys
of
more
equable
climates
he
felt
his
nature
crudely
as
it
was
meant
to
the
boy
henry
adams
summer
was
drunken
among
senses
smell
was
the
strongest
smell
of
hot
and
in
the
scorching
summer
noon
of
hay
of
ploughed
earth
of
box
hedges
of
peaches
lilacs
syringas
of
stables
barns
of
salt
water
and
low
tide
on
the
marshes
nothing
came
amiss
next
to
smell
came
taste
and
the
children
knew
the
taste
of
everything
they
saw
or
touched
from
pennyroyal
and
flagroot
to
the
shell
of
a
pignut
and
the
letters
of
a
the
taste
of
ab
suddenly
revived
on
the
tongue
sixty
years
afterwards
light
line
and
color
as
sensual
pleasures
came
later
and
were
as
crude
as
the
rest
the
new
england
light
is
glare
and
the
atmosphere
harshens
color
the
boy
was
a
full
man
before
he
ever
knew
what
was
meant
by
atmosphere
his
idea
of
pleasure
in
light
was
the
blaze
of
a
new
england
sun
his
idea
of
color
was
a
peony
with
the
dew
of
early
morning
on
its
petals
the
intense
blue
of
the
sea
as
he
saw
it
a
mile
or
two
away
from
the
quincy
hills
the
cumuli
in
a
june
afternoon
sky
the
strong
reds
and
greens
and
purples
of
colored
prints
and
children
as
the
american
colors
then
ran
these
were
ideals
the
opposites
or
antipathies
were
the
cold
grays
of
november
evenings
and
the
thick
muddy
thaws
of
boston
winter
with
such
standards
the
bostonian
could
not
but
develop
a
double
nature
life
was
a
double
thing
after
a
january
blizzard
the
boy
who
could
look
with
pleasure
into
the
violent
of
the
cold
white
sunshine
with
its
intense
light
and
shade
scarcely
knew
what
was
meant
by
tone
he
could
reach
it
only
by
education
winter
and
summer
then
were
two
hostile
lives
and
bred
two
separate
natures
winter
was
always
the
effort
to
live
summer
was
tropical
license
whether
the
children
rolled
in
the
grass
or
waded
in
the
brook
or
swam
in
the
salt
ocean
or
sailed
in
the
bay
or
fished
for
smelts
in
the
creeks
or
netted
minnows
in
the
or
took
to
the
and
the
granite
quarries
or
chased
muskrats
and
hunted
in
the
swamps
or
mushrooms
or
nuts
on
the
autumn
hills
summer
and
country
were
always
sensual
living
while
winter
was
always
compulsory
learning
summer
was
the
multiplicity
of
nature
winter
was
school
the
bearing
of
the
two
seasons
on
the
education
of
henry
adams
was
no
fancy
it
was
the
most
decisive
force
he
ever
knew
it
ran
though
life
and
made
the
division
between
its
perplexing
warring
irreconcilable
problems
irreducible
opposites
with
growing
emphasis
to
the
last
year
of
study
from
earliest
childhood
the
boy
was
accustomed
to
feel
that
for
him
life
was
double
winter
and
summer
town
and
country
law
and
liberty
were
hostile
and
the
man
who
pretended
they
were
not
was
in
his
eyes
a
schoolmaster
that
is
a
man
employed
to
tell
lies
to
little
boys
though
quincy
was
but
two
walk
from
beacon
hill
it
belonged
in
a
different
world
for
two
hundred
years
every
adams
from
father
to
son
had
lived
within
sight
of
state
street
and
sometimes
had
lived
in
it
yet
none
had
ever
taken
kindly
to
the
town
or
been
taken
kindly
by
it
the
boy
inherited
his
double
nature
he
knew
as
yet
nothing
about
his
who
had
died
a
dozen
years
before
his
own
birth
he
took
for
granted
that
any
of
his
must
have
always
been
good
and
his
enemies
wicked
but
he
divined
his
character
from
his
own
never
for
a
moment
did
he
connect
the
two
ideas
of
boston
and
john
adams
they
were
separate
and
antagonistic
the
idea
of
john
adams
went
with
quincy
he
knew
his
grandfather
john
quincy
adams
only
as
an
old
man
of
or
eighty
who
was
friendly
and
gentle
with
him
but
except
that
he
heard
his
grandfather
always
called
the
president
and
his
grandmother
the
madam
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
his
adams
grandfather
differed
in
character
from
his
brooks
grandfather
who
was
equally
kind
and
benevolent
he
liked
the
adams
side
best
but
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
reminded
him
of
the
country
the
summer
and
the
absence
of
restraint
yet
he
felt
also
that
quincy
was
in
a
way
inferior
to
boston
and
that
socially
boston
looked
down
on
quincy
the
reason
was
clear
enough
even
to
a
old
child
quincy
had
no
boston
style
little
enough
style
had
either
a
simpler
manner
of
life
and
thought
could
hardly
exist
short
of
the
with
which
his
grandfather
adams
used
to
light
his
own
fires
in
the
early
morning
was
still
on
the
mantelpiece
of
his
study
the
idea
of
a
livery
or
even
a
dress
for
servants
or
of
an
evening
toilette
was
next
to
blasphemy
bathrooms
lighting
heating
and
the
whole
array
of
domestic
comforts
were
unknown
at
quincy
boston
had
already
a
bathroom
a
a
furnace
and
gas
the
superiority
of
boston
was
evident
but
a
child
liked
it
no
better
for
that
the
magnificence
of
his
grandfather
brooks
house
in
pearl
street
or
south
street
has
long
ago
disappeared
but
perhaps
his
country
house
at
medford
may
still
remain
to
show
what
impressed
the
mind
of
a
boy
in
with
the
idea
of
city
splendor
the
place
at
quincy
was
the
larger
and
older
and
far
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
but
a
boy
felt
at
once
its
inferiority
in
fashion
it
showed
plainly
enough
its
want
of
wealth
it
smacked
of
colonial
age
but
not
of
boston
style
or
plush
curtains
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
never
quite
overcame
the
prejudice
thus
drawn
in
with
his
childish
breath
he
never
could
compel
himself
to
care
for
style
he
was
never
able
to
adopt
it
any
more
than
his
father
or
grandfather
or
had
done
not
that
he
felt
it
as
particularly
hostile
for
he
reconciled
himself
to
much
that
was
worse
but
because
for
some
remote
reason
he
was
born
an
child
the
old
house
at
quincy
was
eighteenth
century
what
style
it
had
was
in
its
queen
anne
mahogany
panels
and
its
louis
seize
chairs
and
sofas
the
panels
belonged
to
an
old
colonial
vassall
who
built
the
house
the
furniture
had
been
brought
back
from
paris
in
or
or
along
with
porcelain
and
books
and
much
else
of
old
diplomatic
remnants
and
neither
of
the
two
styles
neither
english
queen
anne
nor
french
louis
seize
was
comfortable
for
a
boy
or
for
any
one
else
the
dark
mahogany
had
been
painted
white
to
suit
daily
life
in
winter
gloom
nothing
seemed
to
favor
for
a
objects
the
older
forms
on
the
contrary
most
boys
as
well
as
people
preferred
the
new
with
good
reason
and
the
child
felt
himself
distinctly
at
a
disadvantage
for
the
taste
nor
had
personal
preference
any
share
in
his
bias
the
brooks
grandfather
was
as
amiable
and
as
sympathetic
as
the
adams
grandfather
both
were
born
in
and
both
died
in
both
were
kind
to
children
and
both
belonged
rather
to
the
eighteenth
than
to
the
nineteenth
centuries
the
child
knew
no
difference
between
them
except
that
one
was
associated
with
winter
and
the
other
with
summer
one
with
boston
the
other
with
quincy
even
with
medford
the
association
was
hardly
easier
once
as
a
very
young
boy
he
was
taken
to
pass
a
few
days
with
his
grandfather
brooks
under
charge
of
his
aunt
but
became
so
violently
homesick
that
within
hours
he
was
brought
back
in
disgrace
yet
he
could
not
remember
ever
being
seriously
homesick
again
the
attachment
to
quincy
was
not
altogether
sentimental
or
wholly
sympathetic
quincy
was
not
a
bed
of
thornless
roses
even
there
the
curse
of
cain
set
its
mark
there
as
elsewhere
a
cruel
universe
combined
to
crush
a
child
as
though
three
or
four
vigorous
brothers
and
sisters
with
the
best
will
were
not
enough
to
crush
any
child
every
one
else
conspired
towards
an
education
which
he
hated
from
cradle
to
grave
this
problem
of
running
order
through
chaos
direction
through
space
discipline
through
freedom
unity
through
multiplicity
has
always
been
and
must
always
be
the
task
of
education
as
it
is
the
moral
of
religion
philosophy
science
art
politics
and
economy
but
a
boy
will
is
his
life
and
he
dies
when
it
is
broken
as
the
colt
dies
in
harness
taking
a
new
nature
in
becoming
tame
rarely
has
the
boy
felt
kindly
towards
his
tamers
between
him
and
his
master
has
always
been
war
henry
adams
never
knew
a
boy
of
his
generation
to
like
a
master
and
the
task
of
remaining
on
friendly
terms
with
one
own
family
in
such
a
relation
was
never
easy
all
the
more
singular
it
seemed
afterwards
to
him
that
his
first
serious
contact
with
the
president
should
have
been
a
struggle
of
will
in
which
the
old
man
almost
necessarily
defeated
the
boy
but
instead
of
leaving
as
usual
in
such
defeats
a
lifelong
sting
left
rather
an
impression
of
as
fair
treatment
as
could
be
expected
from
a
natural
enemy
the
boy
met
seldom
with
such
restraint
he
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
six
years
old
at
the
time
seven
at
the
utmost
and
his
mother
had
taken
him
to
quincy
for
a
long
stay
with
the
president
during
the
summer
what
became
of
the
rest
of
the
family
he
quite
forgot
but
he
distinctly
remembered
standing
at
the
house
door
one
summer
morning
in
a
passionate
outburst
of
rebellion
against
going
to
school
naturally
his
mother
was
the
immediate
victim
of
his
rage
that
is
what
mothers
are
for
and
boys
also
but
in
this
case
the
boy
had
his
mother
at
unfair
disadvantage
for
she
was
a
guest
and
had
no
means
of
enforcing
obedience
henry
showed
a
certain
tactical
ability
by
refusing
to
start
and
he
met
all
efforts
at
compulsion
by
successful
though
too
vehement
protest
he
was
in
fair
way
to
win
and
was
holding
his
own
with
sufficient
energy
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
staircase
which
led
up
to
the
door
of
the
president
library
when
the
door
opened
and
the
old
man
slowly
came
down
putting
on
his
hat
he
took
the
boy
hand
without
a
word
and
walked
with
him
paralyzed
by
awe
up
the
road
to
the
town
after
the
first
moments
of
consternation
at
this
interference
in
a
domestic
dispute
the
boy
reflected
that
an
old
gentleman
close
on
eighty
would
never
trouble
himself
to
walk
near
a
mile
on
a
hot
summer
morning
over
a
shadeless
road
to
take
a
boy
to
school
and
that
it
would
be
strange
if
a
lad
imbued
with
the
passion
of
freedom
could
not
find
a
corner
to
dodge
around
somewhere
before
reaching
the
school
door
then
and
always
the
boy
insisted
that
this
reasoning
justified
his
apparent
submission
but
the
old
man
did
not
stop
and
the
boy
saw
all
his
strategical
points
turned
one
after
another
until
he
found
himself
seated
inside
the
school
and
obviously
the
centre
of
curious
if
not
malevolent
criticism
not
till
then
did
the
president
release
his
hand
and
depart
the
point
was
that
this
act
contrary
to
the
inalienable
rights
of
boys
and
nullifying
the
social
compact
ought
to
have
made
him
dislike
his
grandfather
for
life
he
could
not
recall
that
it
had
this
effect
even
for
a
moment
with
a
certain
maturity
of
mind
the
child
must
have
recognized
that
the
president
though
a
tool
of
tyranny
had
done
his
disreputable
work
with
a
certain
intelligence
he
had
shown
no
temper
no
irritation
no
personal
feeling
and
had
made
no
display
of
force
above
all
he
had
held
his
tongue
during
their
long
walk
he
had
said
nothing
he
had
uttered
no
syllable
of
revolting
cant
about
the
duty
of
obedience
and
the
wickedness
of
resistance
to
law
he
had
shown
no
concern
in
the
matter
hardly
even
a
consciousness
of
the
existence
probably
his
mind
at
that
moment
was
actually
troubling
itself
little
about
his
grandson
iniquities
and
much
about
the
iniquities
of
president
polk
but
the
boy
could
scarcely
at
that
age
feel
the
whole
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
president
polk
was
to
be
the
vicarious
victim
of
his
own
sins
and
he
gave
his
grandfather
credit
for
intelligent
silence
for
this
forbearance
he
felt
instinctive
respect
he
admitted
force
as
a
form
of
right
he
admitted
even
temper
under
protest
but
the
seeds
of
a
moral
education
would
at
that
moment
have
fallen
on
the
stoniest
soil
in
quincy
which
is
as
every
one
knows
the
stoniest
glacial
and
tidal
drift
known
in
any
puritan
land
neither
party
to
this
momentary
disagreement
can
have
felt
rancor
for
during
these
three
or
four
summers
the
old
relations
with
the
boy
were
friendly
and
almost
intimate
whether
his
older
brothers
and
sisters
were
still
more
favored
he
failed
to
remember
but
he
was
himself
admitted
to
a
sort
of
familiarity
which
when
in
his
turn
he
had
reached
old
age
rather
shocked
him
for
it
must
have
sometimes
tried
the
president
patience
he
hung
about
the
library
handled
the
books
deranged
the
papers
ransacked
the
drawers
searched
the
old
purses
and
for
foreign
coins
drew
the
snapped
the
upset
everything
in
the
corners
and
penetrated
the
president
where
a
row
of
tumblers
inverted
on
the
shelf
covered
caterpillars
which
were
supposed
to
become
moths
or
butterflies
but
never
did
the
madam
bore
with
fortitude
the
loss
of
the
tumblers
which
her
husband
purloined
for
these
hatcheries
but
she
made
protest
when
he
carried
off
her
best
bowls
to
plant
with
acorns
or
peachstones
that
he
might
see
the
roots
grow
but
which
she
said
he
commonly
forgot
like
the
caterpillars
at
that
time
the
president
rode
the
hobby
of
and
some
fine
old
trees
should
still
remain
to
witness
it
unless
they
have
been
improved
off
the
ground
but
his
was
a
restless
mind
and
although
he
took
his
hobbies
seriously
and
would
have
been
annoyed
had
his
grandchild
asked
whether
he
was
bored
like
an
english
duke
he
probably
cared
more
for
the
processes
than
for
the
results
so
that
his
grandson
was
saddened
by
the
sight
and
smell
of
peaches
and
pears
the
best
of
their
kind
which
he
brought
up
from
the
garden
to
rot
on
his
shelves
for
seed
with
the
inherited
virtues
of
his
puritan
ancestors
the
little
boy
henry
conscientiously
brought
up
to
him
in
his
study
the
finest
peaches
he
found
in
the
garden
and
ate
only
the
less
perfect
naturally
he
ate
more
by
way
of
compensation
but
the
act
showed
that
he
bore
no
grudge
as
for
his
grandfather
it
is
even
possible
that
he
may
have
felt
a
certain
for
his
temporary
role
of
schoolmaster
seeing
that
his
own
career
did
not
offer
proof
of
the
worldly
advantages
of
docile
obedience
for
there
still
exists
somewhere
a
little
volume
of
critically
edited
nursery
rhymes
with
the
boy
name
in
full
written
in
the
president
trembling
hand
on
the
of
course
there
was
also
the
bible
given
to
each
child
at
birth
with
the
proper
inscription
in
the
president
hand
on
the
while
their
grandfather
brooks
supplied
the
silver
mugs
so
many
bibles
and
silver
mugs
had
to
be
supplied
that
a
new
house
or
cottage
was
built
to
hold
them
it
was
on
the
hill
five
minutes
walk
above
the
old
house
with
a
far
view
eastward
over
quincy
bay
and
northward
over
boston
till
his
twelfth
year
the
child
passed
his
summers
there
and
his
pleasures
of
childhood
mostly
centred
in
it
of
education
he
had
as
yet
little
to
complain
country
schools
were
not
very
serious
nothing
stuck
to
the
mind
except
home
impressions
and
the
sharpest
were
those
of
kindred
children
but
as
influences
that
warped
a
mind
none
compared
with
the
mere
effect
of
the
back
of
the
president
bald
head
as
he
sat
in
his
pew
on
sundays
in
line
with
that
of
president
quincy
who
though
some
ten
years
younger
seemed
to
children
about
the
same
age
before
railways
entered
the
new
england
town
every
parish
church
showed
of
these
leading
citizens
with
gray
hair
who
sat
on
the
main
aisle
in
the
best
pews
and
had
sat
there
or
in
some
equivalent
dignity
since
the
time
of
augustine
if
not
since
the
glacial
epoch
it
was
unusual
for
boys
to
sit
behind
a
president
grandfather
and
to
read
over
his
head
the
tablet
in
memory
of
a
president
who
had
pledged
his
life
his
fortune
and
his
sacred
honor
to
secure
the
independence
of
his
country
and
so
forth
but
boys
naturally
supposed
without
much
reasoning
that
other
boys
had
the
equivalent
of
president
grandfathers
and
that
churches
would
always
go
on
with
the
leading
citizens
on
the
main
aisle
and
presidents
or
their
equivalents
on
the
walls
the
irish
gardener
once
said
to
the
child
you
be
thinkin
you
be
president
too
the
casuality
of
the
remark
made
so
strong
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
he
never
forgot
it
he
could
not
remember
ever
to
have
thought
on
the
subject
to
him
that
there
should
be
a
doubt
of
his
being
president
was
a
new
idea
what
had
been
would
continue
to
be
he
doubted
neither
about
presidents
nor
about
churches
and
no
one
suggested
at
that
time
a
doubt
whether
a
system
of
society
which
had
lasted
since
adam
would
outlast
one
adams
more
the
madam
was
a
little
more
remote
than
the
president
but
more
decorative
she
stayed
much
in
her
own
room
with
the
dutch
tiles
looking
out
on
her
garden
with
the
box
walks
and
seemed
a
fragile
creature
to
a
boy
who
sometimes
brought
her
a
note
or
a
message
and
took
distinct
pleasure
in
looking
at
her
delicate
face
under
what
seemed
to
him
very
becoming
caps
he
liked
her
refined
figure
her
gentle
voice
and
manner
her
vague
effect
of
not
belonging
there
but
to
washington
or
to
europe
like
her
furniture
and
with
little
glass
doors
above
and
little
volumes
in
old
binding
labelled
peregrine
pickle
or
tom
jones
or
hannah
more
try
as
she
might
the
madam
could
never
be
bostonian
and
it
was
her
cross
in
life
but
to
the
boy
it
was
her
charm
even
at
that
age
he
felt
drawn
to
it
the
madam
life
had
been
in
truth
far
from
boston
she
was
born
in
london
in
daughter
of
joshua
johnson
an
american
merchant
brother
of
governor
thomas
johnson
of
maryland
and
catherine
nuth
of
an
english
family
in
london
driven
from
england
by
the
revolutionary
war
joshua
johnson
took
his
family
to
nantes
where
they
remained
till
the
peace
the
girl
louisa
catherine
was
nearly
ten
years
old
when
brought
back
to
london
and
her
sense
of
nationality
must
have
been
confused
but
the
influence
of
the
johnsons
and
the
services
of
joshua
obtained
for
him
from
president
washington
the
appointment
of
consul
in
london
on
the
organization
of
the
government
in
in
president
washington
appointed
john
quincy
adams
minister
to
the
hague
he
was
years
old
when
he
returned
to
london
and
found
the
consul
house
a
very
agreeable
haunt
louisa
was
then
twenty
at
that
time
and
long
afterwards
the
consul
house
far
more
than
the
minister
was
the
centre
of
contact
for
travelling
americans
either
official
or
other
the
legation
was
a
shifting
point
between
and
but
the
consulate
far
down
in
the
city
near
the
tower
was
convenient
and
inviting
so
inviting
that
it
proved
fatal
to
young
adams
louisa
was
charming
like
a
romney
portrait
but
among
her
many
charms
that
of
being
a
new
england
woman
was
not
one
the
defect
was
serious
her
future
abigail
a
famous
new
england
woman
whose
authority
over
her
turbulent
husband
the
second
president
was
hardly
so
great
as
that
which
she
exercised
over
her
son
the
sixth
to
be
was
troubled
by
the
fear
that
louisa
might
not
be
made
of
stuff
stern
enough
or
brought
up
in
conditions
severe
enough
to
suit
a
new
england
climate
or
to
make
an
efficient
wife
for
her
paragon
son
and
abigail
was
right
on
that
point
as
on
most
others
where
sound
judgment
was
involved
but
sound
judgment
is
sometimes
a
source
of
weakness
rather
than
of
force
and
john
quincy
already
had
reason
to
think
that
his
mother
held
sound
judgments
on
the
subject
of
which
human
nature
since
the
fall
of
eve
made
adams
helpless
to
realize
being
three
thousand
miles
away
from
his
mother
and
equally
far
in
love
he
married
louisa
in
london
july
and
took
her
to
berlin
to
be
the
head
of
the
united
states
legation
during
three
or
four
exciting
years
the
young
bride
lived
in
berlin
whether
she
was
happy
or
not
whether
she
was
content
or
not
whether
she
was
socially
successful
or
not
her
descendants
did
not
surely
know
but
in
any
case
she
could
by
no
chance
have
become
educated
there
for
a
life
in
quincy
or
boston
in
the
overthrow
of
the
federalist
party
drove
her
and
her
husband
to
america
and
she
became
at
last
a
member
of
the
quincy
household
but
by
that
time
her
children
needed
all
her
attention
and
she
remained
there
with
occasional
winters
in
boston
and
washington
till
her
husband
was
made
senator
in
and
in
was
appointed
minister
to
russia
she
went
with
him
to
petersburg
taking
her
baby
charles
francis
born
in
but
at
having
to
leave
her
two
older
boys
behind
the
life
at
petersburg
was
hardly
gay
for
her
they
were
far
too
poor
to
shine
in
that
extravagant
society
but
she
survived
it
though
her
little
girl
baby
did
not
and
in
the
winter
of
alone
with
the
boy
of
seven
years
old
crossed
europe
from
petersburg
to
paris
in
her
passing
through
the
armies
and
reaching
paris
in
the
cent
jours
after
napoleon
return
from
elba
her
husband
next
went
to
england
as
minister
and
she
was
for
two
years
at
the
court
of
the
regent
in
her
husband
came
home
to
be
secretary
of
state
and
she
lived
for
eight
years
in
f
street
doing
her
work
of
entertainer
for
president
monroe
administration
next
she
lived
four
miserable
years
in
the
white
house
when
that
chapter
was
closed
in
she
had
earned
the
right
to
be
tired
and
delicate
but
she
still
had
fifteen
years
to
serve
as
wife
of
a
member
of
the
house
after
her
husband
went
back
to
congress
in
then
it
was
that
the
little
henry
her
grandson
first
remembered
her
from
to
sitting
in
her
panelled
room
at
breakfast
with
her
heavy
silver
teapot
and
and
which
still
exist
somewhere
as
an
heirloom
of
the
modern
by
that
time
she
was
seventy
years
old
or
more
and
thoroughly
weary
of
being
beaten
about
a
stormy
world
to
the
boy
she
seemed
singularly
peaceful
a
vision
of
silver
gray
presiding
over
her
old
president
and
her
queen
anne
mahogany
an
exotic
like
her
sevres
china
an
object
of
deference
to
every
one
and
of
great
affection
to
her
son
charles
but
hardly
more
bostonian
than
she
had
been
fifty
years
before
on
her
in
the
shadow
of
the
tower
of
london
such
a
figure
was
even
less
fitted
than
that
of
her
old
husband
the
president
to
impress
on
a
boy
mind
the
standards
of
the
coming
century
she
was
louis
seize
like
the
furniture
the
boy
knew
nothing
of
her
interior
life
which
had
been
as
the
venerable
abigail
long
since
at
peace
foresaw
one
of
severe
stress
and
little
pure
satisfaction
he
never
dreamed
that
from
her
might
come
some
of
those
doubts
and
those
hesitations
those
rebellions
against
law
and
discipline
which
marked
more
than
one
of
her
descendants
but
he
might
even
then
have
felt
some
vague
instinctive
suspicion
that
he
was
to
inherit
from
her
the
seeds
of
the
primal
sin
the
fall
from
grace
the
curse
of
abel
that
he
was
not
of
pure
new
england
stock
but
half
exotic
as
a
child
of
quincy
he
was
not
a
true
bostonian
but
even
as
a
child
of
quincy
he
inherited
a
quarter
taint
of
maryland
blood
charles
francis
half
marylander
by
birth
had
hardly
seen
boston
till
he
was
ten
years
old
when
his
parents
left
him
there
at
school
in
and
he
never
forgot
the
experience
he
was
to
be
nearly
as
old
as
his
mother
had
been
in
before
he
quite
accepted
boston
or
boston
quite
accepted
him
a
boy
who
began
his
education
in
these
surroundings
with
physical
strength
inferior
to
that
of
his
brothers
and
with
a
certain
delicacy
of
mind
and
bone
ought
rightly
to
have
felt
at
home
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
should
in
proper
have
rebelled
against
the
standards
of
the
nineteenth
the
atmosphere
of
his
first
ten
years
must
have
been
very
like
that
of
his
grandfather
at
the
same
age
from
till
barring
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
and
even
as
late
as
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
remained
actual
the
tone
of
boston
society
was
colonial
the
true
bostonian
always
knelt
in
before
the
majesty
of
english
standards
far
from
concealing
it
as
a
weakness
he
was
proud
of
it
as
his
strength
the
eighteenth
century
ruled
society
long
after
perhaps
the
boy
began
to
shake
it
off
rather
earlier
than
most
of
his
mates
indeed
this
prehistoric
stage
of
education
ended
rather
abruptly
with
his
tenth
year
one
winter
morning
he
was
conscious
of
a
certain
confusion
in
the
house
in
mount
vernon
street
and
gathered
from
such
words
as
he
could
catch
that
the
president
who
happened
to
be
then
staying
there
on
his
way
to
washington
had
fallen
and
hurt
himself
then
he
heard
the
word
paralysis
after
that
day
he
came
to
associate
the
word
with
the
figure
of
his
grandfather
in
a
invalid
armchair
on
one
side
of
the
spare
bedroom
fireplace
and
one
of
his
old
friends
parkman
or
degrand
on
the
other
side
both
dozing
the
end
of
this
first
or
ancestral
and
revolutionary
chapter
came
on
february
and
the
month
of
february
brought
life
and
death
as
a
family
habit
when
the
eighteenth
century
as
an
actual
and
living
companion
vanished
if
the
scene
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
the
old
president
fell
struck
the
still
american
public
with
a
sensation
unusually
dramatic
its
effect
on
a
boy
whose
was
fading
away
with
the
life
of
his
grandfather
could
not
be
slight
one
had
to
pay
for
revolutionary
patriots
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
presidents
diplomats
queen
anne
mahogany
and
louis
seize
chairs
as
well
as
for
stuart
portraits
such
things
warp
young
life
americans
commonly
believed
that
they
ruined
it
and
perhaps
the
practical
of
the
american
mind
judged
right
many
a
boy
might
be
ruined
by
much
less
than
the
emotions
of
the
funeral
service
in
the
quincy
church
with
its
surroundings
of
national
respect
and
family
pride
by
another
dramatic
chance
it
happened
that
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
lunt
was
an
unusual
pulpit
orator
the
ideal
of
a
somewhat
austere
intellectual
type
such
as
the
school
of
buckminster
and
channing
inherited
from
the
old
congregational
clergy
his
extraordinarily
refined
appearance
his
dignity
of
manner
his
deeply
cadenced
voice
his
remarkable
english
and
his
fine
appreciation
gave
to
the
funeral
service
a
character
that
left
an
overwhelming
impression
on
the
boy
mind
he
was
to
see
many
great
functions
funerals
and
festival
in
till
his
only
thought
was
to
see
no
more
but
he
never
again
witnessed
anything
nearly
so
impressive
to
him
as
the
last
services
at
quincy
over
the
body
of
one
president
and
the
ashes
of
another
the
effect
of
the
quincy
service
was
deepened
by
the
official
ceremony
which
afterwards
took
place
in
faneuil
hall
when
the
boy
was
taken
to
hear
his
uncle
edward
everett
deliver
a
eulogy
like
all
everett
orations
it
was
an
admirable
piece
of
oratory
such
as
only
an
admirable
orator
and
scholar
could
create
too
good
for
a
boy
to
appreciate
at
its
value
but
already
the
boy
knew
that
the
dead
president
could
not
be
in
it
and
had
even
learned
why
he
would
have
been
out
of
place
there
for
knowledge
was
beginning
to
come
fast
the
shadow
of
the
war
of
still
hung
over
state
street
the
shadow
of
the
civil
war
to
come
had
already
begun
to
darken
faneuil
hall
no
rhetoric
could
have
reconciled
everett
audience
to
his
subject
how
could
he
say
there
to
an
assemblage
of
bostonians
in
the
heart
of
mercantile
boston
that
the
only
distinctive
mark
of
all
the
adamses
since
old
sam
adams
father
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
had
been
their
inherited
quarrel
with
state
street
which
had
again
and
again
broken
out
into
riot
bloodshed
personal
feuds
foreign
and
civil
war
wholesale
banishments
and
confiscations
until
the
history
of
florence
was
hardly
more
turbulent
than
that
of
boston
how
could
he
whisper
the
word
hartford
convention
before
the
men
who
had
made
it
what
would
have
been
said
had
he
suggested
the
chance
of
secession
and
civil
war
thus
already
at
ten
years
old
the
boy
found
himself
standing
face
to
face
with
a
dilemma
that
might
have
puzzled
an
early
christian
what
was
he
where
was
he
going
even
then
he
felt
that
something
was
wrong
but
he
concluded
that
it
must
be
boston
quincy
had
always
been
right
for
quincy
represented
a
moral
principle
the
principle
of
resistance
to
boston
his
adams
ancestors
must
have
been
right
since
they
were
always
hostile
to
state
street
if
state
street
was
wrong
quincy
must
be
right
turn
the
dilemma
as
he
pleased
he
still
came
back
on
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
law
of
resistance
of
truth
of
duty
and
of
freedom
he
was
a
priest
and
politician
he
could
under
no
circumstances
have
guessed
what
the
next
fifty
years
had
in
store
and
no
one
could
teach
him
but
sometimes
in
his
old
age
he
wondered
and
could
never
decide
whether
the
most
clear
and
certain
knowledge
would
have
helped
him
supposing
he
had
seen
a
new
york
of
and
had
studied
the
statistics
of
railways
telegraphs
coal
and
steel
would
he
have
quitted
his
his
ancestral
prejudices
his
abstract
ideals
his
training
and
the
rest
in
order
to
perform
an
expiatory
pilgrimage
to
state
street
and
ask
for
the
fatted
calf
of
his
grandfather
brooks
and
a
clerkship
in
the
suffolk
bank
sixty
years
afterwards
he
was
still
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
each
course
had
its
advantages
but
the
material
advantages
looking
back
seemed
to
lie
wholly
in

their

born

a

named

her

the

was
a

named

the

named

henry

after
a
favorite

just
lost
more
followed
but
these
being
younger
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
arduous
process
of
educating
the
adams
connection
was
singularly
small
in
boston
but
the
family
of
brooks
was
singularly
large
and
even
brilliant
and
almost
wholly
of
clerical
new
england
stock
one
might
have
sought
long
in
much
larger
and
older
societies
for
three
more
distinguished
or
more
scholarly
than
edward
everett
frothingham
and
adams
one
might
have
sought
equally
long
for
seven
more
unlike
no
doubt
they
all
bore
more
or
less
the
stamp
of
boston
or
at
least
of
massachusetts
bay
but
the
shades
of
difference
amounted
to
contrasts
everett
belonged
to
boston
hardly
more
than
adams
one
of
the
most
ambitious
of
bostonians
he
had
broken
bounds
early
in
life
by
leaving
the
unitarian
pulpit
to
take
a
seat
in
congress
where
he
had
given
valuable
support
to
administration
support
which
as
a
social
consequence
led
to
the
marriage
of
the
president
son
charles
francis
with
youngest
abigail
brooks
the
wreck
of
parties
which
marked
the
reign
of
andrew
jackson
had
interfered
with
many
promising
careers
that
of
edward
everett
among
the
rest
but
he
had
risen
with
the
whig
party
to
power
had
gone
as
minister
to
england
and
had
returned
to
america
with
the
halo
of
a
european
reputation
and
undisputed
rank
second
only
to
daniel
webster
as
the
orator
and
representative
figure
of
boston
the
other
frothingham
belonged
to
the
same
clerical
school
though
in
manner
rather
the
less
clerical
of
the
two
neither
of
them
had
much
in
common
with
adams
who
was
a
younger
man
greatly
biassed
by
his
father
and
by
the
inherited
feud
between
quincy
and
state
street
but
personal
relations
were
friendly
as
far
as
a
boy
could
see
and
the
innumerable
cousins
went
regularly
to
the
first
church
every
sunday
in
winter
and
slept
through
their
uncle
sermons
without
once
thinking
to
ask
what
the
sermons
were
supposed
to
mean
for
them
for
two
hundred
years
the
first
church
had
seen
the
same
little
boys
sleeping
more
or
less
soundly
under
the
same
or
similar
conditions
and
dimly
conscious
of
the
same
feuds
but
the
feuds
had
never
ceased
and
the
boys
had
always
grown
up
to
inherit
them
those
of
the
generation
of
had
mostly
disappeared
in
death
had
cleared
that
score
the
quarrels
of
john
adams
and
those
of
john
quincy
adams
were
no
longer
acutely
personal
the
game
was
considered
as
drawn
and
charles
francis
adams
might
then
have
taken
his
inherited
rights
of
political
leadership
in
succession
to
webster
and
everett
his
seniors
between
him
and
state
street
the
relation
was
more
natural
than
between
edward
everett
and
state
street
but
instead
of
doing
so
charles
francis
adams
drew
himself
aloof
and
renewed
the
old
war
which
had
already
lasted
since
he
could
not
help
it
with
the
record
of
adams
fresh
in
the
popular
memory
his
son
and
his
only
representative
could
not
make
terms
with
the
and
the
overshadowed
all
the
great
boston
interests
no
doubt
adams
had
principles
of
his
own
as
well
as
inherited
but
even
his
children
who
as
yet
had
no
principles
could
equally
little
follow
the
lead
of
webster
or
even
of
seward
they
would
have
lost
in
consideration
more
than
they
would
have
gained
in
patronage
they
were
by
birth
as
their
name
was
adams
and
their
home
was
quincy
no
matter
how
much
they
had
wished
to
enter
state
street
they
felt
that
state
street
never
would
trust
them
or
they
it
had
state
street
been
paradise
they
must
hunger
for
it
in
vain
and
it
hardly
needed
daniel
webster
to
act
as
archangel
with
the
flaming
sword
to
order
them
away
from
the
door
time
and
experience
which
alter
all
perspectives
altered
this
among
the
rest
and
taught
the
boy
gentler
judgment
but
even
when
only
ten
years
old
his
face
was
already
fixed
and
his
heart
was
stone
against
state
street
his
education
was
warped
beyond
recovery
in
the
direction
of
puritan
politics
between
him
and
his
patriot
grandfather
at
the
same
age
the
conditions
had
changed
little
the
year
was
like
enough
to
the
year
to
make
a
fair
parallel
the
parallel
as
concerned
bias
of
education
was
complete
when
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
john
quincy
adams
a
convention
of
delegates
met
at
buffalo
to
organize
a
new
party
and
named
candidates
for
the
general
election
in
november
for
president
martin
van
buren
for
charles
francis
adams
for
any
american
boy
the
fact
that
his
father
was
running
for
office
would
have
dwarfed
for
the
time
every
other
excitement
but
even
apart
from
personal
bias
the
year
for
a
boy
road
through
life
was
decisive
for
twenty
years
to
come
there
was
never
a
of
escape
the
stamp
of
was
almost
as
indelible
as
the
stamp
of
but
in
the
eighteenth
or
any
earlier
century
the
stamp
mattered
less
because
it
was
standard
and
every
one
bore
it
while
men
whose
lives
were
to
fall
in
the
generation
between
and
had
first
of
all
to
get
rid
of
it
and
take
the
stamp
that
belonged
to
their
time
this
was
their
education
to
outsiders
immigrants
adventurers
it
was
easy
but
the
old
puritan
nature
rebelled
against
change
the
reason
it
gave
was
forcible
the
puritan
thought
his
thought
higher
and
his
moral
standards
better
than
those
of
his
successors
so
they
were
he
could
not
be
convinced
that
moral
standards
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
that
utilitarian
morality
was
good
enough
for
him
as
it
was
for
the
graceless
nature
had
given
to
the
boy
henry
a
character
that
in
any
previous
century
would
have
led
him
into
the
church
he
inherited
dogma
and
a
priori
thought
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
he
scarcely
needed
a
violent
reaction
like
politics
to
sweep
him
back
into
puritanism
with
a
violence
as
great
as
that
of
a
religious
war
thus
far
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
his
education
was
chiefly
inheritance
and
during
the
next
five
or
six
years
his
father
alone
counted
for
much
if
he
were
to
worry
successfully
through
quicksands
he
must
depend
chiefly
on
his
father
pilotage
but
for
his
father
the
channel
lay
clear
while
for
himself
an
unknown
ocean
lay
beyond
his
father
business
in
life
was
to
get
past
the
dangers
of
the
or
to
fix
its
bounds
at
least
the
task
done
he
might
be
content
to
let
his
sons
pay
for
the
pilotage
and
it
mattered
little
to
his
success
whether
they
paid
it
with
their
lives
wasted
on
or
in
misdirected
energies
and
lost
opportunity
the
generation
that
lived
from
to
could
do
very
well
with
the
old
forms
of
education
that
which
had
its
work
to
do
between
and
needed
something
quite
new
his
father
character
was
therefore
the
larger
part
of
his
education
as
far
as
any
single
person
affected
it
and
for
that
reason
if
for
no
other
the
son
was
always
a
much
interested
critic
of
his
father
mind
and
temper
long
after
his
death
as
an
old
man
of
eighty
his
sons
continued
to
discuss
this
subject
with
a
good
deal
of
difference
in
their
points
of
view
to
his
son
henry
the
quality
that
distinguished
his
father
from
all
the
other
figures
in
the
family
group
was
that
in
his
opinion
charles
francis
adams
possessed
the
only
perfectly
balanced
mind
that
ever
existed
in
the
name
for
a
hundred
years
every
newspaper
scribbler
had
with
more
or
less
obvious
excuse
derided
or
abused
the
older
adamses
for
want
of
judgment
they
abused
charles
francis
for
his
judgment
naturally
they
never
attempted
to
assign
values
to
either
that
was
the
children
affair
but
the
traits
were
real
charles
francis
adams
was
singular
for
mental
poise
absence
of
or
the
faculty
of
standing
apart
without
seeming
aware
that
he
was
alone
a
balance
of
mind
and
temper
that
neither
challenged
nor
avoided
notice
nor
admitted
question
of
superiority
or
inferiority
of
jealousy
of
personal
motives
from
any
source
even
under
great
pressure
this
unusual
poise
of
judgment
and
temper
ripened
by
age
became
the
more
striking
to
his
son
henry
as
he
learned
to
measure
the
mental
faculties
themselves
which
were
in
no
way
exceptional
either
for
depth
or
range
charles
francis
adams
memory
was
hardly
above
the
average
his
mind
was
not
bold
like
his
grandfather
or
restless
like
his
father
or
imaginative
or
oratorical
still
less
mathematical
but
it
worked
with
singular
perfection
admirable
and
instinctive
mastery
of
form
within
its
range
it
was
a
model
the
standards
of
boston
were
high
much
affected
by
the
old
clerical
which
gave
the
unitarian
clergy
unusual
social
charm
channing
everett
frothingham
palfrey
president
walker
emerson
and
other
boston
ministers
of
the
same
school
would
have
commanded
distinction
in
any
society
but
the
adamses
had
little
or
no
affinity
with
the
pulpit
and
still
less
with
its
eccentric
offshoots
like
theodore
parker
or
brook
farm
or
the
philosophy
of
concord
besides
its
clergy
boston
showed
a
literary
group
led
by
ticknor
prescott
longfellow
motley
holmes
but
adams
was
not
one
of
them
as
a
rule
they
were
much
too
websterian
even
in
science
boston
could
claim
a
certain
eminence
especially
in
medicine
but
adams
cared
very
little
for
science
he
stood
alone
he
had
no
master
hardly
even
his
father
he
had
no
scholars
hardly
even
his
sons
almost
alone
among
his
boston
contemporaries
he
was
not
english
in
feeling
or
in
sympathies
perhaps
a
hundred
years
of
acute
hostility
to
england
had
something
to
do
with
this
family
trait
but
in
his
case
it
went
further
and
became
indifference
to
social
distinction
never
once
in
forty
years
of
intimacy
did
his
son
notice
in
him
a
trace
of
snobbishness
he
was
one
of
the
exceedingly
small
number
of
americans
to
whom
an
english
duke
or
duchess
seemed
to
be
indifferent
and
royalty
itself
nothing
more
than
a
slightly
inconvenient
presence
this
was
it
is
true
rather
the
tone
of
english
society
in
his
time
but
americans
were
largely
responsible
for
changing
it
and
adams
had
every
possible
reason
for
affecting
the
manner
of
a
courtier
even
if
he
did
not
feel
the
sentiment
never
did
his
son
see
him
flatter
or
vilify
or
show
a
sign
of
envy
or
jealousy
never
a
shade
of
vanity
or
never
a
tone
of
arrogance
never
a
gesture
of
pride
the
same
thing
might
perhaps
have
been
said
of
john
quincy
adams
but
in
him
his
associates
averred
that
it
was
accompanied
by
mental
restlessness
and
often
by
lamentable
want
of
judgment
no
one
ever
charged
charles
francis
adams
with
this
fault
the
critics
charged
him
with
just
the
opposite
defect
they
called
him
cold
no
doubt
such
perfect
poise
such
intuitive
was
not
maintained
by
nature
without
a
sacrifice
of
the
qualities
which
would
have
upset
it
no
doubt
too
that
even
his
introspective
children
who
knew
him
best
were
much
too
ignorant
of
the
world
and
of
human
nature
to
suspect
how
rare
and
complete
was
the
model
before
their
eyes
a
coarser
instrument
would
have
impressed
them
more
average
human
nature
is
very
coarse
and
its
ideals
must
necessarily
be
average
the
world
never
loved
perfect
poise
what
the
world
does
love
is
commonly
absence
of
poise
for
it
has
to
be
amused
napoleons
and
andrew
jacksons
amuse
it
but
it
is
not
amused
by
perfect
balance
had
adams
nature
been
cold
he
would
have
followed
webster
everett
seward
and
winthrop
in
the
lines
of
party
discipline
and
had
it
been
less
balanced
than
it
was
he
would
have
gone
with
garrison
wendell
phillips
edmund
quincy
and
theodore
parker
into
secession
between
the
two
paths
he
found
an
intermediate
one
distinctive
and
characteristic
he
set
up
a
party
of
his
own
this
political
party
became
a
chief
influence
in
the
education
of
the
boy
henry
in
the
six
years
to
and
violently
affected
his
character
at
the
moment
when
character
is
plastic
the
group
of
men
with
whom
adams
associated
himself
and
whose
social
centre
was
the
house
in
mount
vernon
street
numbered
only
three
john
palfrey
richard
dana
and
charles
sumner
palfrey
was
the
oldest
and
in
spite
of
his
clerical
education
was
to
a
boy
often
the
most
agreeable
for
his
talk
was
lighter
and
his
range
wider
than
that
of
the
others
he
had
wit
or
humor
and
the
of
exchange
born
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
he
forced
himself
to
be
clergyman
professor
or
statesman
while
like
every
other
true
bostonian
he
yearned
for
the
ease
of
the
athenaeum
club
in
pall
mall
or
the
combination
room
at
trinity
dana
at
first
suggested
the
opposite
he
affected
to
be
still
before
the
mast
a
direct
rather
bluff
vigorous
seaman
and
only
as
one
got
to
know
him
better
one
found
the
man
of
rather
excessive
refinement
trying
with
success
to
work
like
a
deliberately
hardening
his
skin
to
the
burden
as
though
he
were
still
carrying
hides
at
monterey
undoubtedly
he
succeeded
for
his
mind
and
will
were
robust
but
he
might
have
said
what
his
lifelong
friend
william
evarts
used
to
say
i
pride
myself
on
my
success
in
doing
not
the
things
i
like
to
do
but
the
things
i
do
like
to
do
dana
ideal
of
life
was
to
be
a
great
englishman
with
a
seat
on
the
front
benches
of
the
house
of
commons
until
he
should
be
promoted
to
the
woolsack
beyond
all
with
a
social
status
that
should
place
him
above
the
scuffle
of
provincial
and
unprofessional
annoyances
but
he
forced
himself
to
take
life
as
it
came
and
he
suffocated
his
longings
with
grim
by
mere
force
of
will
of
the
four
men
dana
was
the
most
marked
without
dogmatism
or
he
seemed
always
to
be
fully
in
sight
a
figure
that
completely
filled
a
space
he
too
talked
well
and
his
mind
worked
close
to
its
subject
as
a
lawyer
should
but
disguise
and
silence
it
as
he
liked
it
was
aristocratic
to
the
tenth
generation
in
that
respect
and
in
that
only
charles
sumner
was
like
him
but
sumner
in
almost
every
other
quality
was
quite
different
from
his
three
associates
altogether
out
of
line
he
too
adored
english
standards
but
his
ambition
led
him
to
rival
the
career
of
edmund
burke
no
young
bostonian
of
his
time
had
made
so
brilliant
a
start
but
rather
in
the
steps
of
edward
everett
than
of
daniel
webster
as
an
orator
he
had
achieved
a
triumph
by
his
oration
against
war
but
boston
admired
him
chiefly
for
his
social
success
in
england
and
on
the
continent
success
that
gave
to
every
bostonian
who
enjoyed
it
a
halo
never
acquired
by
domestic
sanctity
sumner
both
by
interest
and
instinct
felt
the
value
of
his
english
connection
and
cultivated
it
the
more
as
he
became
socially
an
outcast
from
boston
society
by
the
passions
of
politics
he
was
rarely
without
a
of
letters
from
duchesses
or
noblemen
in
england
having
sacrificed
to
principle
his
social
position
in
america
he
clung
the
more
closely
to
his
foreign
attachments
the
free
soil
party
fared
ill
in
beacon
street
the
social
arbiters
of
boston
george
ticknor
and
the
rest
had
to
admit
however
unwillingly
that
the
free
soil
leaders
could
not
mingle
with
the
friends
and
followers
of
webster
sumner
was
socially
ostracized
and
so
for
that
matter
were
palfrey
dana
russell
adams
and
all
the
other
avowed
leaders
but
for
them
it
mattered
less
because
they
had
houses
and
families
of
their
own
while
sumner
had
neither
wife
nor
household
and
though
the
most
socially
ambitious
of
all
and
the
most
hungry
for
what
used
to
be
called
polite
society
he
could
enter
hardly
houses
in
boston
longfellow
stood
by
him
in
cambridge
and
even
in
beacon
street
he
could
always
take
refuge
in
the
house
of
lodge
but
few
days
passed
when
he
did
not
pass
some
time
in
mount
vernon
street
even
with
that
his
solitude
was
glacial
and
reacted
on
his
character
he
had
nothing
but
himself
to
think
about
his
superiority
was
indeed
real
and
incontestable
he
was
the
classical
ornament
of
the
party
their
pride
in
him
was
unbounded
and
their
admiration
outspoken
the
boy
henry
worshipped
him
and
if
he
ever
regarded
any
older
man
as
a
personal
friend
it
was
sumner
the
relation
of
sumner
in
the
household
was
far
closer
than
any
relation
of
blood
none
of
the
uncles
approached
such
intimacy
sumner
was
the
boy
ideal
of
greatness
the
highest
product
of
nature
and
art
the
only
fault
of
such
a
model
was
its
superiority
which
defied
imitation
to
the
boy
his
father
palfrey
dana
were
men
more
or
less
like
what
he
himself
might
become
but
sumner
was
a
different
order
heroic
as
the
boy
grew
up
to
be
ten
or
twelve
years
old
his
father
gave
him
a
in
one
of
the
alcoves
of
his
boston
library
and
there
winter
after
winter
henry
worked
over
his
latin
grammar
and
listened
to
these
four
gentlemen
discussing
the
course
of
politics
the
discussions
were
always
serious
the
free
soil
party
took
itself
quite
seriously
and
they
were
habitual
because
adams
had
undertaken
to
edit
a
newspaper
as
the
organ
of
these
gentlemen
who
came
to
discuss
its
policy
and
expression
at
the
same
time
adams
was
editing
the
works
of
his
grandfather
john
adams
and
made
the
boy
read
texts
for
in
after
years
his
father
sometimes
complained
that
as
a
reader
of
novanglus
and
massachusettensis
henry
had
shown
very
little
consciousness
of
punctuation
but
the
boy
regarded
this
part
of
school
life
only
as
a
warning
if
he
ever
grew
up
to
write
dull
discussions
in
the
newspapers
to
try
to
be
dull
in
some
different
way
from
that
of
his
yet
the
discussions
in
the
boston
whig
were
carried
on
in
much
the
same
style
as
those
of
john
adams
and
his
opponent
and
appealed
to
much
the
same
society
and
the
same
habit
of
mind
the
boy
got
as
little
education
fitting
him
for
his
own
time
from
the
one
as
from
the
other
and
he
got
no
more
from
his
contact
with
the
gentlemen
themselves
who
were
all
types
of
the
past
down
to
and
even
later
new
england
society
was
still
directed
by
the
professions
lawyers
physicians
professors
merchants
were
classes
and
acted
not
as
individuals
but
as
though
they
were
clergymen
and
each
profession
were
a
church
in
politics
the
system
required
competent
expression
it
was
the
old
ciceronian
idea
of
government
by
the
best
that
produced
the
long
line
of
new
england
statesmen
they
chose
men
to
represent
them
because
they
wanted
to
be
well
represented
and
they
chose
the
best
they
had
thus
boston
chose
daniel
webster
and
webster
took
not
as
pay
but
as
honorarium
the
cheques
raised
for
him
by
peter
harvey
from
the
appletons
perkinses
amorys
searses
brookses
lawrences
and
so
on
who
begged
him
to
represent
them
edward
everett
held
the
rank
in
regular
succession
to
webster
robert
winthrop
claimed
succession
to
everett
charles
sumner
aspired
to
break
the
succession
but
not
the
system
the
adamses
had
never
been
for
any
length
of
time
a
part
of
this
state
succession
they
had
preferred
the
national
service
and
had
won
all
their
distinction
outside
the
state
but
they
too
had
required
state
support
and
had
commonly
received
it
the
little
group
of
men
in
mount
vernon
street
were
an
offshoot
of
this
system
they
were
statesmen
not
politicians
they
guided
public
opinion
but
were
little
guided
by
it
the
boy
naturally
learned
only
one
lesson
from
his
saturation
in
such
air
he
took
for
granted
that
this
sort
of
world
more
or
less
the
same
that
had
always
existed
in
boston
and
massachusetts
bay
was
the
world
which
he
was
to
fit
had
he
known
europe
he
would
have
learned
no
better
the
paris
of
louis
philippe
guizot
and
de
tocqueville
as
well
as
the
london
of
robert
peel
macaulay
and
john
stuart
mill
were
but
varieties
of
the
same
bourgeoisie
that
felt
instinctive
cousinship
with
the
boston
of
ticknor
prescott
and
motley
even
the
typical
grumbler
carlyle
who
cast
doubts
on
the
real
capacity
of
the
middle
class
and
who
at
times
thought
himself
eccentric
found
friendship
and
alliances
in
boston
still
more
in
concord
the
system
had
proved
so
successful
that
even
germany
wanted
to
try
it
and
italy
yearned
for
it
england
government
was
the
ideal
of
human
progress
even
the
violent
reaction
after
and
the
return
of
all
europe
to
military
practices
never
for
a
moment
shook
the
true
faith
no
one
except
karl
marx
foresaw
radical
change
what
announced
it
the
world
was
producing
sixty
or
seventy
million
tons
of
coal
and
might
be
using
nearly
a
million
just
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
all
experience
since
the
creation
of
man
all
divine
revelation
or
human
science
conspired
to
deceive
and
betray
a
boy
who
took
for
granted
that
his
ideas
which
were
alone
respectable
would
be
alone
respected
viewed
from
mount
vernon
street
the
problem
of
life
was
as
simple
as
it
was
classic
politics
offered
no
difficulties
for
there
the
moral
law
was
a
sure
guide
social
perfection
was
also
sure
because
human
nature
worked
for
good
and
three
instruments
were
all
she
asked
suffrage
common
schools
and
press
on
these
points
doubt
was
forbidden
education
was
divine
and
man
needed
only
a
correct
knowledge
of
facts
to
reach
perfection
were
half
the
power
that
fills
the
world
with
terror
were
half
the
wealth
bestowed
on
camps
and
courts
given
to
redeem
the
human
mind
from
error
there
were
no
need
of
arsenals
nor
forts
nothing
quieted
doubt
so
completely
as
the
mental
calm
of
the
unitarian
clergy
in
uniform
excellence
of
life
and
character
moral
and
intellectual
the
score
of
unitarian
clergymen
about
boston
who
controlled
society
and
harvard
college
were
never
excelled
they
proclaimed
as
their
merit
that
they
insisted
on
no
doctrine
but
taught
or
tried
to
teach
the
means
of
leading
a
virtuous
useful
unselfish
life
which
they
held
to
be
sufficient
for
salvation
for
them
difficulties
might
be
ignored
doubts
were
waste
of
thought
nothing
exacted
solution
boston
had
solved
the
universe
or
had
offered
and
realized
the
best
solution
yet
tried
the
problem
was
worked
out
of
all
the
conditions
of
his
youth
which
afterwards
puzzled
the
man
this
disappearance
of
religion
puzzled
him
most
the
boy
went
to
church
twice
every
sunday
he
was
taught
to
read
his
bible
and
he
learned
religious
poetry
by
heart
he
believed
in
a
mild
deism
he
prayed
he
went
through
all
the
forms
but
neither
to
him
nor
to
his
brothers
or
sisters
was
religion
real
even
the
mild
discipline
of
the
unitarian
church
was
so
irksome
that
they
all
threw
it
off
at
the
first
possible
moment
and
never
afterwards
entered
a
church
the
religious
instinct
had
vanished
and
could
not
be
revived
although
one
made
in
later
life
many
efforts
to
recover
it
that
the
most
powerful
emotion
of
man
next
to
the
sexual
should
disappear
might
be
a
personal
defect
of
his
own
but
that
the
most
intelligent
society
led
by
the
most
intelligent
clergy
in
the
most
moral
conditions
he
ever
knew
should
have
solved
all
the
problems
of
the
universe
so
thoroughly
as
to
have
quite
ceased
making
itself
anxious
about
past
or
future
and
should
have
persuaded
itself
that
all
the
problems
which
had
convulsed
human
thought
from
earliest
recorded
time
were
not
worth
discussing
seemed
to
him
the
most
curious
social
phenomenon
he
had
to
account
for
in
a
long
life
the
faculty
of
turning
away
one
eyes
as
one
approaches
a
chasm
is
not
unusual
and
boston
showed
under
the
lead
of
webster
how
successfully
it
could
be
done
in
politics
but
in
politics
a
certain
number
of
men
did
at
least
protest
in
religion
and
philosophy
no
one
protested
such
protest
as
was
made
took
forms
more
simple
than
the
silence
like
the
deism
of
theodore
parker
and
of
the
boy
own
cousin
octavius
frothingham
who
distressed
his
father
and
scandalized
beacon
street
by
avowing
scepticism
that
seemed
to
solve
no
old
problems
and
to
raise
many
new
ones
the
less
aggressive
protest
of
ralph
waldo
emerson
was
from
an
point
of
view
less
serious
it
was
naif
the
children
reached
manhood
without
knowing
religion
and
with
the
certainty
that
dogma
metaphysics
and
abstract
philosophy
were
not
worth
knowing
so
an
education
could
have
been
possible
in
no
other
country
or
time
but
it
became
almost
of
necessity
the
more
literary
and
political
as
the
children
grew
up
they
exaggerated
the
literary
and
the
political
interests
they
joined
in
the
discussions
and
from
childhood
the
boys
were
accustomed
to
hear
almost
every
day
as
good
as
they
were
ever
likely
to
hear
again
the
eldest
child
louisa
was
one
of
the
most
sparkling
creatures
her
brother
met
in
a
long
and
varied
experience
of
bright
women
the
oldest
son
john
was
afterwards
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
talkers
in
boston
society
and
perhaps
the
most
popular
man
in
the
state
though
apt
to
be
on
the
unpopular
side
palfrey
and
dana
could
be
entertaining
when
they
pleased
and
though
charles
sumner
could
hardly
be
called
light
in
hand
he
was
willing
to
be
amused
and
smiled
grandly
from
time
to
time
while
adams
who
talked
relatively
little
was
always
a
good
listener
and
laughed
over
a
witticism
till
he
choked
by
way
of
educating
and
amusing
the
children
adams
read
much
aloud
and
was
sure
to
read
political
literature
especially
when
it
was
satirical
like
the
speeches
of
horace
mann
and
the
epistles
of
hosea
biglow
with
great
delight
to
the
youth
so
he
read
longfellow
and
tennyson
as
their
poems
appeared
but
the
children
took
possession
of
dickens
and
thackeray
for
themselves
both
were
too
modern
for
tastes
founded
on
pope
and
johnson
the
boy
henry
soon
became
a
desultory
reader
of
every
book
he
found
readable
but
these
were
commonly
historians
because
his
library
was
full
of
them
in
the
want
of
positive
instincts
he
drifted
into
the
mental
indolence
of
history
so
too
he
read
shelves
of
poetry
but
when
his
father
offered
his
own
set
of
wordsworth
as
a
gift
on
condition
of
reading
it
through
he
declined
pope
and
gray
called
for
no
mental
effort
they
were
easy
reading
but
the
boy
was
thirty
years
old
before
his
education
reached
wordsworth
this
is
the
story
of
an
education
and
the
person
or
persons
who
figure
in
it
are
supposed
to
have
values
only
as
educators
or
educated
the
surroundings
concern
it
only
so
far
as
they
affect
education
sumner
dana
palfrey
had
values
of
their
own
like
hume
pope
and
wordsworth
which
any
one
may
study
in
their
works
here
all
appear
only
as
influences
on
the
mind
of
a
boy
very
nearly
the
average
of
most
boys
in
physical
and
mental
stature
the
influence
was
wholly
political
and
literary
his
father
made
no
effort
to
force
his
mind
but
left
him
free
play
and
this
was
perhaps
best
only
in
one
way
his
father
rendered
him
a
great
service
by
trying
to
teach
him
french
and
giving
him
some
idea
of
a
french
accent
otherwise
the
family
was
rather
an
atmosphere
than
an
influence
the
boy
had
a
large
and
overpowering
set
of
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
modes
or
replicas
of
the
same
type
getting
the
same
education
struggling
with
the
same
problems
and
solving
the
question
or
leaving
it
unsolved
much
in
the
same
way
they
knew
no
more
than
he
what
they
wanted
or
what
to
do
for
it
but
all
were
conscious
that
they
would
like
to
control
power
in
some
form
and
the
same
thing
could
be
said
of
an
ant
or
an
elephant
their
form
was
tied
to
politics
or
literature
they
amounted
to
one
individual
with
sides
or
facets
their
temperaments
reacted
on
each
other
and
made
each
child
more
like
the
other
this
was
also
education
but
in
the
type
and
the
boston
or
new
england
type
was
well
enough
known
what
no
one
knew
was
whether
the
individual
who
thought
himself
a
representative
of
this
type
was
fit
to
deal
with
life
as
far
as
outward
bearing
went
such
a
family
of
turbulent
children
given
free
rein
by
their
parents
or
indifferent
to
check
should
have
come
to
more
or
less
grief
certainly
no
one
was
strong
enough
to
control
them
least
of
all
their
mother
the
of
the
hive
on
whom
of
the
burden
fell
on
whose
strength
they
all
depended
but
whose
children
were
much
too
and
to
take
guidance
from
her
or
from
any
one
else
unless
in
the
direction
they
fancied
father
and
mother
were
about
equally
helpless
almost
every
large
family
in
those
days
produced
at
least
one
black
sheep
and
if
this
generation
of
adamses
escaped
it
was
as
much
a
matter
of
surprise
to
them
as
to
their
neighbors
by
some
happy
chance
they
grew
up
to
be
decent
citizens
but
henry
adams
as
a
brand
escaped
from
the
burning
always
looked
back
with
astonishment
at
their
luck
the
fact
seemed
to
prove
that
they
were
born
like
birds
with
a
certain
innate
balance
home
influences
alone
never
saved
the
new
england
boy
from
ruin
though
sometimes
they
may
have
helped
to
ruin
him
and
the
influences
outside
of
home
were
negative
if
school
helped
it
was
only
by
reaction
the
dislike
of
school
was
so
strong
as
to
be
a
positive
gain
the
passionate
hatred
of
school
methods
was
almost
a
method
in
itself
yet
the
of
that
time
was
respectable
and
the
boy
had
nothing
to
complain
of
in
fact
he
never
complained
he
hated
it
because
he
was
here
with
a
crowd
of
other
boys
and
compelled
to
learn
by
memory
a
quantity
of
things
that
did
not
amuse
him
his
memory
was
slow
and
the
effort
painful
for
him
to
conceive
that
his
memory
could
compete
for
school
prizes
with
machines
of
two
or
three
times
its
power
was
to
prove
himself
wanting
not
only
in
memory
but
flagrantly
in
mind
he
thought
his
mind
a
good
enough
machine
if
it
were
given
time
to
act
but
it
acted
wrong
if
hurried
schoolmasters
never
gave
time
in
any
and
all
its
forms
the
boy
detested
school
and
the
prejudice
became
deeper
with
years
he
always
reckoned
his
from
ten
to
sixteen
years
old
as
time
thrown
away
perhaps
his
needs
turned
out
to
be
exceptional
but
his
existence
was
exceptional
between
and
nearly
every
one
existence
was
exceptional
for
success
in
the
life
imposed
on
him
he
needed
as
afterwards
appeared
the
facile
use
of
only
four
tools
mathematics
french
german
and
spanish
with
these
he
could
master
in
very
short
time
any
special
branch
of
inquiry
and
feel
at
home
in
any
society
latin
and
greek
he
could
with
the
help
of
the
modern
languages
learn
more
completely
by
the
intelligent
work
of
six
weeks
than
in
the
six
years
he
spent
on
them
at
school
these
four
tools
were
necessary
to
his
success
in
life
but
he
never
controlled
any
one
of
them
thus
at
the
outset
he
was
condemned
to
failure
more
or
less
complete
in
the
life
awaiting
him
but
not
more
so
than
his
companions
indeed
had
his
father
kept
the
boy
at
home
and
given
him
half
an
hour
direction
every
day
he
would
have
done
more
for
him
than
school
ever
could
do
for
them
of
course
men
and
boys
looked
down
on
boys
and
rather
prided
themselves
on
their
own
ignorance
but
the
man
of
sixty
can
generally
see
what
he
needed
in
life
and
in
henry
adams
opinion
it
was
not
school
most
school
experience
was
bad
boy
associations
at
fifteen
were
worse
than
none
boston
at
that
time
offered
few
healthy
resources
for
boys
or
men
the
and
were
more
familiar
than
parents
knew
as
a
rule
boys
could
skate
and
swim
and
were
sent
to
they
played
a
rudimentary
game
of
baseball
football
and
hockey
a
few
could
sail
a
boat
still
fewer
had
been
out
with
a
gun
to
shoot
or
a
stray
wild
duck
one
or
two
may
have
learned
something
of
natural
history
if
they
came
from
the
neighborhood
of
concord
none
could
ride
across
country
or
knew
what
shooting
with
dogs
meant
sport
as
a
pursuit
was
unknown
came
after
for
only
the
existed
of
all
pleasures
winter
sleighing
was
still
the
gayest
and
most
popular
from
none
of
these
amusements
could
the
boy
learn
anything
likely
to
be
of
use
to
him
in
the
world
books
remained
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
source
of
life
and
as
they
came
out
thackeray
dickens
bulwer
tennyson
macaulay
carlyle
and
the
rest
they
were
devoured
but
as
far
as
happiness
went
the
happiest
hours
of
the
boy
education
were
passed
in
summer
lying
on
a
musty
heap
of
congressional
documents
in
the
old
farmhouse
at
quincy
reading
quentin
durward
ivanhoe
and
the
talisman
and
raiding
the
garden
at
intervals
for
peaches
and
pears
on
the
whole

learned

then
chapter

washington
except
for

mount
vernon
street
had
the
merit
of
leaving
the
supple
free
to
turn
with
the
world
and
if
one
learned
next
to
nothing
the
little
one
did
learn
needed
not
to
be
unlearned
the
surface
was
ready
to
take
any
form
that
education
should
cut
into
it
though
boston
with
singular
foresight
rejected
the
old
designs
what
sort
of
education
was
stamped
elsewhere
a
bostonian
had
no
idea
but
he
escaped
the
evils
of
other
standards
by
having
no
standard
at
all
and
what
was
true
of
school
was
true
of
society
boston
offered
none
that
could
help
outside
every
one
now
smiles
at
the
bad
taste
of
queen
victoria
and
louis
philippe
the
society
of
the
forties
but
the
taste
was
only
a
reflection
of
the
social
between
a
tide
passed
and
a
tide
to
come
boston
belonged
to
neither
and
hardly
even
to
america
neither
aristocratic
nor
industrial
nor
social
boston
girls
and
boys
were
not
nearly
as
unformed
as
english
boys
and
girls
but
had
less
means
of
acquiring
form
as
they
grew
older
women
counted
for
little
as
models
every
boy
from
the
age
of
seven
fell
in
love
at
frequent
intervals
with
some
girl
always
more
or
less
the
same
little
girl
who
had
nothing
to
teach
him
or
he
to
teach
her
except
rather
familiar
and
provincial
manners
until
they
married
and
bore
children
to
repeat
the
habit
the
idea
of
attaching
one
self
to
a
married
woman
or
of
polishing
one
manners
to
suit
the
standards
of
women
of
thirty
could
hardly
have
entered
the
mind
of
a
young
bostonian
and
would
have
scandalized
his
parents
from
women
the
boy
got
the
domestic
virtues
and
nothing
else
he
might
not
even
catch
the
idea
that
women
had
more
to
give
the
garden
of
eden
was
hardly
more
primitive
to
balance
this
virtue
the
puritan
city
had
always
hidden
a
darker
side
blackguard
boston
was
only
too
educational
and
to
most
boys
much
the
more
interesting
a
successful
blackguard
must
enjoy
great
physical
advantages
besides
a
true
vocation
and
henry
adams
had
neither
but
no
boy
escaped
some
contact
with
vice
of
a
very
low
form
blackguardism
came
constantly
under
boys
eyes
and
had
the
charm
of
force
and
freedom
and
superiority
to
culture
or
decency
one
might
fear
it
but
no
one
honestly
despised
it
now
and
then
it
asserted
itself
as
education
more
roughly
than
school
ever
did
one
of
the
commonest
of
winter
inherited
directly
from
the
was
a
game
of
war
on
boston
common
in
old
days
the
two
hostile
forces
were
called
and
in
the
still
survived
as
a
legend
but
in
practice
it
was
a
battle
of
the
latin
school
against
all
comers
and
the
latin
school
for
snowball
included
all
the
boys
of
the
west
end
whenever
on
a
the
weather
was
soft
enough
to
soften
the
snow
the
common
was
apt
to
be
the
scene
of
a
fight
which
began
in
daylight
with
the
latin
school
in
force
rushing
their
opponents
down
to
tremont
street
and
which
generally
ended
at
dark
by
the
latin
school
dwindling
in
numbers
and
disappearing
as
the
latin
school
grew
weak
the
roughs
and
young
blackguards
grew
strong
as
long
as
snowballs
were
the
only
weapon
no
one
was
much
hurt
but
a
stone
may
be
put
in
a
snowball
and
in
the
dark
a
stick
or
a
slungshot
in
the
hands
of
a
boy
is
as
effective
as
a
knife
one
afternoon
the
fight
had
been
long
and
exhausting
the
boy
henry
following
as
his
habit
was
his
bigger
brother
charles
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
and
had
felt
his
courage
much
depressed
by
seeing
one
of
his
trustiest
leaders
henry
higginson
bully
hig
his
school
name
struck
by
a
stone
over
the
eye
and
led
off
the
field
bleeding
in
rather
a
ghastly
manner
as
night
came
on
the
latin
school
was
steadily
forced
back
to
the
beacon
street
mall
where
they
could
retreat
no
further
without
disbanding
and
by
that
time
only
a
small
band
was
left
headed
by
two
heroes
savage
and
marvin
a
dark
mass
of
figures
could
be
seen
below
making
ready
for
the
last
rush
and
rumor
said
that
a
swarm
of
blackguards
from
the
slums
led
by
a
grisly
terror
called
conky
daniels
with
a
club
and
a
hideous
reputation
was
going
to
put
an
end
to
the
beacon
street
cowards
forever
henry
wanted
to
run
away
with
the
others
but
his
brother
was
too
big
to
run
away
so
they
stood
still
and
waited
immolation
the
dark
mass
set
up
a
shout
and
rushed
forward
the
beacon
street
boys
turned
and
fled
up
the
steps
except
savage
and
marvin
and
the
few
champions
who
would
not
run
the
terrible
conky
daniels
swaggered
up
stopped
a
moment
with
his
to
swear
a
few
oaths
at
marvin
and
then
swept
on
and
chased
the
flyers
leaving
the
few
boys
untouched
who
stood
their
ground
the
obvious
moral
taught
that
blackguards
were
not
so
black
as
they
were
painted
but
the
boy
henry
had
passed
through
as
much
terror
as
though
he
were
turenne
or
henri
iv
and
ten
or
twelve
years
afterwards
when
these
same
boys
were
fighting
and
falling
on
all
the
of
virginia
and
maryland
he
wondered
whether
their
education
on
boston
common
had
taught
savage
and
marvin
how
to
die
if
violence
were
a
part
of
complete
education
boston
was
not
incomplete
the
idea
of
violence
was
familiar
to
the
leaders
as
well
as
to
their
followers
most
of
them
suffered
from
it
mobs
were
always
possible
henry
never
happened
to
be
actually
concerned
in
a
mob
but
he
like
every
other
boy
was
sure
to
be
on
hand
wherever
a
mob
was
expected
and
whenever
he
heard
garrison
or
wendell
phillips
speak
he
looked
for
trouble
wendell
phillips
on
a
platform
was
a
model
dangerous
for
youth
theodore
parker
in
his
pulpit
was
not
much
safer
worst
of
all
the
execution
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
in
boston
the
sight
of
court
square
packed
with
bayonets
and
his
own
friends
obliged
to
line
the
streets
under
arms
as
state
militia
in
order
to
return
a
negro
to
slavery
wrought
frenzy
in
the
brain
of
a
boy
from
quincy
who
wanted
to
miss
no
reasonable
chance
of
mischief
one
lived
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
stamp
act
the
tea
tax
and
the
boston
massacre
within
boston
a
boy
was
first
an
politician
and
afterwards
only
a
possibility
beyond
boston
the
first
step
led
only
further
into
politics
after
february
but
one
slight
tie
remained
of
all
those
that
since
had
connected
quincy
with
the
outer
world
the
madam
stayed
in
washington
after
her
husband
death
and
in
her
turn
was
struck
by
paralysis
and
bedridden
from
time
to
time
her
son
charles
whose
affection
and
sympathy
for
his
mother
in
her
many
tribulations
were
always
pronounced
went
on
to
see
her
and
in
may
he
took
with
him
his
son
the
journey
was
meant
as
education
and
as
education
it
served
the
purpose
of
fixing
in
memory
the
stage
of
a
boy
thought
in
he
could
not
remember
taking
special
interest
in
the
railroad
journey
or
in
new
york
with
railways
and
cities
he
was
familiar
enough
his
first
impression
was
the
novelty
of
crossing
new
york
bay
and
finding
an
english
railway
carriage
on
the
camden
and
amboy
railroad
this
was
a
new
world
a
suggestion
of
corruption
in
the
simple
habits
of
american
life
a
step
to
exclusiveness
never
approached
in
boston
but
it
was
amusing
the
boy
rather
liked
it
at
trenton
the
train
set
him
on
board
a
steamer
which
took
him
to
philadelphia
where
he
smelt
other
varieties
of
town
life
then
again
by
boat
to
chester
and
by
train
to
havre
de
grace
by
boat
to
baltimore
and
thence
by
rail
to
washington
this
was
the
journey
he
remembered
the
actual
journey
may
have
been
quite
different
but
the
actual
journey
has
no
interest
for
education
the
memory
was
all
that
mattered
and
what
struck
him
most
to
remain
fresh
in
his
mind
all
his
lifetime
was
the
sudden
change
that
came
over
the
world
on
entering
a
slave
state
he
took
education
politically
the
mere
raggedness
of
outline
could
not
have
seemed
wholly
new
for
even
boston
had
its
ragged
edges
and
the
town
of
quincy
was
far
from
being
a
vision
of
neatness
or
in
truth
he
had
never
seen
a
finished
landscape
but
maryland
was
raggedness
of
a
new
kind
the
railway
about
the
size
and
character
of
a
modern
tram
rambled
through
unfenced
fields
and
woods
or
through
village
streets
among
a
haphazard
variety
of
pigs
cows
and
negro
babies
who
might
all
have
used
the
cabins
for
pens
and
styes
had
the
southern
pig
required
styes
but
who
never
showed
a
sign
of
care
this
was
the
boy
impression
of
what
slavery
caused
and
for
him
was
all
it
taught
coming
down
in
the
early
morning
from
his
bedroom
in
his
grandmother
house
still
called
the
adams
building
in
f
street
and
venturing
outside
into
the
air
reeking
with
the
thick
odor
of
the
catalpa
trees
he
found
himself
on
an
or
village
street
with
meandering
from
the
colonnade
of
the
treasury
hard
by
to
the
white
marble
columns
and
fronts
of
the
post
office
and
patent
office
which
faced
each
other
in
the
distance
like
white
greek
temples
in
the
abandoned
of
a
deserted
syrian
city
here
and
there
low
wooden
houses
were
scattered
along
the
streets
as
in
other
southern
villages
but
he
was
chiefly
attracted
by
an
unfinished
square
marble
shaft
below
and
he
walked
down
to
inspect
it
before
breakfast
his
aunt
drily
remarked
that
at
this
rate
he
would
soon
get
through
all
the
sights
but
she
could
not
guess
having
lived
always
in
washington
how
little
the
sights
of
washington
had
to
do
with
its
interest
the
boy
could
not
have
told
her
he
was
nowhere
near
an
understanding
of
himself
the
more
he
was
educated
the
less
he
understood
slavery
struck
him
in
the
face
it
was
a
nightmare
a
horror
a
crime
the
sum
of
all
wickedness
contact
made
it
only
more
repulsive
he
wanted
to
escape
like
the
negroes
to
free
soil
slave
states
were
dirty
unkempt
ignorant
vicious
he
had
not
a
thought
but
repulsion
for
it
and
yet
the
picture
had
another
side
the
may
sunshine
and
shadow
had
something
to
do
with
it
the
thickness
of
foliage
and
the
heavy
smells
had
more
the
sense
of
atmosphere
almost
new
had
perhaps
as
much
again
and
the
brooding
indolence
of
a
warm
climate
and
a
negro
population
hung
in
the
atmosphere
heavier
than
the
catalpas
the
impression
was
not
simple
but
the
boy
liked
it
distinctly
it
remained
on
his
mind
as
an
attraction
almost
obscuring
quincy
itself
the
want
of
barriers
of
pavements
of
forms
the
looseness
the
laziness
the
indolent
southern
drawl
the
pigs
in
the
streets
the
negro
babies
and
their
mothers
with
bandanas
the
freedom
openness
swagger
of
nature
and
man
soothed
his
johnson
blood
most
boys
would
have
felt
it
in
the
same
way
but
with
him
the
feeling
caught
on
to
an
inheritance
the
softness
of
his
gentle
old
grandmother
as
she
lay
in
bed
and
chatted
with
him
did
not
come
from
boston
his
aunt
was
anything
rather
than
bostonian
he
did
not
wholly
come
from
boston
himself
though
washington
belonged
to
a
different
world
and
the
two
worlds
could
not
live
together
he
was
not
sure
that
he
enjoyed
the
boston
world
most
even
at
twelve
years
old
he
could
see
his
own
nature
no
more
clearly
than
he
would
at
twelve
hundred
if
by
accident
he
should
happen
to
live
so
long
his
father
took
him
to
the
capitol
and
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
which
then
and
long
afterwards
until
the
era
of
tourists
was
freely
open
to
visitors
the
old
senate
chamber
resembled
a
pleasant
political
club
standing
behind
the
chair
which
is
now
the
chief
justice
the
boy
was
presented
to
some
of
the
men
whose
names
were
great
in
their
day
and
as
familiar
to
him
as
his
own
clay
and
webster
and
calhoun
were
there
still
but
with
them
a
free
soil
candidate
for
the
had
little
to
do
what
struck
boys
most
was
their
type
senators
were
a
species
they
all
wore
an
air
as
they
wore
a
blue
dress
coat
or
brass
buttons
they
were
roman
the
type
of
senator
in
was
rather
charming
at
its
best
and
the
senate
when
in
good
temper
was
an
agreeable
body
numbering
only
some
sixty
members
and
affecting
the
airs
of
courtesy
its
vice
was
not
so
much
a
vice
of
manners
or
temper
as
of
attitude
the
statesman
of
all
periods
was
apt
to
be
pompous
but
even
pomposity
was
less
offensive
than
familiarity
on
the
platform
as
in
the
pulpit
and
southern
pomposity
when
not
arrogant
was
genial
and
sympathetic
almost
quaint
and
childlike
in
its
quite
a
different
thing
from
the
websterian
or
conklinian
pomposity
of
the
north
the
boy
felt
at
ease
there
more
at
home
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
boston
state
house
though
his
acquaintance
with
the
codfish
in
the
house
of
representatives
went
back
beyond
distinct
recollection
senators
spoke
kindly
to
him
and
seemed
to
feel
so
for
they
had
known
his
family
socially
and
in
spite
of
slavery
even
adams
in
his
later
years
after
he
ceased
to
stand
in
the
way
of
rivals
had
few
personal
enemies
decidedly
the
senate
though
it
were
seemed
a
friendly
world
this
first
step
in
national
politics
was
a
little
like
the
walk
before
breakfast
an
easy
careless
genial
enlarging
stride
into
a
fresh
and
amusing
world
where
nothing
was
finished
but
where
even
the
weeds
grew
rank
the
second
step
was
like
the
first
except
that
it
led
to
the
white
house
he
was
taken
to
see
president
taylor
outside
in
a
paddock
in
front
old
whitey
the
president
charger
was
grazing
as
they
entered
and
inside
the
president
was
receiving
callers
as
simply
as
if
he
were
in
the
paddock
too
the
president
was
friendly
and
the
boy
felt
no
sense
of
strangeness
that
he
could
ever
recall
in
fact
what
strangeness
should
he
feel
the
families
were
intimate
so
intimate
that
their
friendliness
outlived
generations
civil
war
and
all
sorts
of
rupture
president
taylor
owed
his
election
to
martin
van
buren
and
the
free
soil
party
to
him
the
adamses
might
still
be
of
use
as
for
the
white
house
all
the
boy
family
had
lived
there
and
barring
the
eight
years
of
andrew
jackson
reign
had
been
more
or
less
at
home
there
ever
since
it
was
built
the
boy
half
thought
he
owned
it
and
took
for
granted
that
he
should
some
day
live
in
it
he
felt
no
sensation
whatever
before
presidents
a
president
was
a
matter
of
course
in
every
respectable
family
he
had
two
in
his
own
three
if
he
counted
old
nathaniel
gorham
who
was
the
oldest
and
first
in
distinction
revolutionary
patriots
or
perhaps
a
colonial
governor
might
be
worth
talking
about
but
any
one
could
be
president
and
some
very
shady
characters
were
likely
to
be
presidents
senators
congressmen
and
such
things
were
swarming
in
every
street
every
one
thought
alike
whether
they
had
ancestors
or
not
no
sort
of
glory
hedged
presidents
as
such
and
in
the
whole
country
one
could
hardly
have
met
with
an
admission
of
respect
for
any
office
or
name
unless
it
were
george
washington
that
was
to
all
appearance
sincerely
respected
people
made
pilgrimages
to
mount
vernon
and
made
even
an
effort
to
build
washington
a
monument
the
effort
had
failed
but
one
still
went
to
mount
vernon
although
it
was
no
easy
trip
adams
took
the
boy
there
in
a
carriage
and
pair
over
a
road
that
gave
him
a
complete
virginia
education
for
use
ten
years
afterwards
to
the
new
england
mind
roads
schools
clothes
and
a
clean
face
were
connected
as
part
of
the
law
of
order
or
divine
system
bad
roads
meant
bad
morals
the
moral
of
this
virginia
road
was
clear
and
the
boy
fully
learned
it
slavery
was
wicked
and
slavery
was
the
cause
of
this
road
badness
which
amounted
to
social
crime
and
yet
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
product
of
the
crime
stood
mount
vernon
and
george
washington
luckily
boys
accept
contradictions
as
readily
as
their
elders
do
or
this
boy
might
have
become
prematurely
wise
he
had
only
to
repeat
what
he
was
told
that
george
washington
stood
alone
otherwise
this
third
step
in
his
washington
education
would
have
been
his
last
on
that
line
the
problem
of
progress
was
not
soluble
whatever
the
optimists
and
orators
might
say
or
for
that
matter
whatever
they
might
think
george
washington
could
not
be
reached
on
boston
lines
george
washington
was
a
primary
or
if
virginians
liked
it
better
an
ultimate
relation
like
the
pole
star
and
amid
the
endless
restless
motion
of
every
other
visible
point
in
space
he
alone
remained
steady
in
the
mind
of
henry
adams
to
the
end
all
the
other
points
shifted
their
bearings
john
adams
jefferson
madison
franklin
even
john
marshall
took
varied
lights
and
assumed
new
relations
but
mount
vernon
always
remained
where
it
was
with
no
practicable
road
to
reach
it
and
yet
when
he
got
there
mount
vernon
was
only
quincy
in
a
southern
setting
no
doubt
it
was
much
more
charming
but
it
was
the
same
the
same
old
furniture
the
same
old
patriot
and
the
same
old
president
the
boy
took
to
it
instinctively
the
broad
potomac
and
the
coons
in
the
trees
the
bandanas
and
the
the
bedrooms
upstairs
and
the
porch
outside
even
martha
washington
herself
in
memory
were
as
natural
as
the
tides
and
the
may
sunshine
he
had
only
enlarged
his
horizon
a
little
but
he
never
thought
to
ask
himself
or
his
father
how
to
deal
with
the
moral
problem
that
deduced
george
washington
from
the
sum
of
all
wickedness
in
practice
such
trifles
as
contradictions
in
principle
are
easily
set
aside
the
faculty
of
ignoring
them
makes
the
practical
man
but
any
attempt
to
deal
with
them
seriously
as
education
is
fatal
luckily
charles
francis
adams
never
preached
and
was
singularly
free
from
cant
he
may
have
had
views
of
his
own
but
he
let
his
son
henry
satisfy
himself
with
the
simple
elementary
fact
that
george
washington
stood
alone
life
was
not
yet
complicated
every
problem
had
a
solution
even
the
negro
the
boy
went
back
to
boston
more
political
than
ever
and
his
politics
were
no
longer
so
modern
as
the
eighteenth
century
but
took
a
strong
tone
of
the
seventeenth
slavery
drove
the
whole
puritan
community
back
on
its
puritanism
the
boy
thought
as
dogmatically
as
though
he
were
one
of
his
own
ancestors
the
slave
power
took
the
place
of
stuart
kings
and
roman
popes
education
could
go
no
further
in
that
course
and
ran
off
into
emotion
but
as
the
boy
gradually
found
his
surroundings
change
and
felt
himself
no
longer
an
isolated
atom
in
a
hostile
universe
but
a
sort
of
in
a
shoal
of
moving
fish
he
began
to
learn
the
first
and
easier
lessons
of
practical
politics
thus
far
he
had
seen
nothing
but
statesmanship
america
and
he
began
at
the
same
time
to
become
aware
of
a
new
force
under
the
innocent
surface
of
party
machinery
even
at
that
early
moment
a
rather
slow
boy
felt
dimly
conscious
that
he
might
meet
some
personal
difficulties
in
trying
to
reconcile
principles
and
statesmanship
with
late
party
organization
the
first
vague
sense
of
feeling
an
unknown
living
obstacle
in
the
dark
came
in
the
free
soil
conclave
in
mount
vernon
street
belonged
as
already
said
to
the
statesman
class
and
like
daniel
webster
had
nothing
to
do
with
machinery
websters
or
sewards
depended
on
others
for
machine
work
and
money
on
peter
harveys
and
thurlow
weeds
who
spent
their
lives
in
it
took
most
of
the
abuse
and
asked
no
reward
almost
without
knowing
it
the
subordinates
ousted
their
employers
and
created
a
machine
which
no
one
but
themselves
could
run
in
things
had
not
quite
reached
that
point
the
men
who
ran
the
small
free
soil
machine
were
still
modest
though
they
became
famous
enough
in
their
own
right
henry
wilson
john
b
alley
anson
burlingame
and
the
other
managers
negotiated
a
bargain
with
the
massachusetts
democrats
giving
the
state
to
the
democrats
and
a
seat
in
the
senate
to
the
free
soilers
with
this
bargain
adams
and
his
statesman
friends
would
have
nothing
to
do
for
such
a
coalition
was
in
their
eyes
much
like
jockeys
selling
a
race
they
did
not
care
to
take
office
as
pay
for
votes
sold
to
democrats
theirs
was
a
correct
not
to
say
noble
position
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
took
the
benefit
of
the
sale
for
the
coalition
chose
charles
sumner
as
its
candidate
for
the
senate
while
george
boutwell
was
made
governor
for
the
democrats
this
was
the
boy
first
lesson
in
practical
politics
and
a
sharp
one
not
that
he
troubled
himself
with
moral
doubts
but
that
he
learned
the
nature
of
a
flagrantly
corrupt
political
bargain
in
which
he
was
too
good
to
take
part
but
not
too
good
to
take
profit
charles
sumner
happened
to
be
the
partner
to
receive
these
stolen
goods
but
between
his
friend
and
his
father
the
boy
felt
no
distinction
and
for
him
there
was
none
he
entered
into
no
casuistry
on
the
matter
his
friend
was
right
because
his
friend
and
the
boy
shared
the
glory
the
question
of
education
did
not
rise
while
the
conflict
lasted
yet
every
one
saw
as
clearly
then
as
afterwards
that
a
lesson
of
some
sort
must
be
learned
and
understood
once
for
all
the
boy
might
ignore
as
a
mere
historical
puzzle
the
question
how
to
deduce
george
washington
from
the
sum
of
all
wickedness
but
he
had
himself
helped
to
deduce
charles
sumner
from
the
sum
of
political
corruption
on
that
line
too
education
could
go
no
further
tammany
hall
stood
at
the
end
of
the
vista
alley
one
of
the
strictest
of
moralists
held
that
his
object
in
making
the
bargain
was
to
convert
the
democratic
party
to
principles
and
that
he
did
it
henry
adams
could
rise
to
no
such
moral
elevation
he
was
only
a
boy
and
his
object
in
supporting
the
coalition
was
that
of
making
his
friend
a
senator
it
was
as
personal
as
though
he
had
helped
to
make
his
friend
a
millionaire
he
could
never
find
a
way
of
escaping
immoral
conclusions
except
by
admitting
that
he
and
his
father
and
sumner
were
wrong
and
this
he
was
never
willing
to
do
for
the
consequences
of
this
admission
were
worse
than
those
of
the
other
thus
before
he
was
fifteen
years
old
he
had
managed
to
get
himself
into
a
state
of
moral
confusion
from
which
he
never
escaped
as
a
politician
he
was
already
corrupt
and
he
never
could
see
how
any
practical
politician
could
be
less
corrupt
than
himself
apology
as
he
understood
himself
was
cant
or
cowardice
at
the
time
he
never
even
dreamed
that
he
needed
to
apologize
though
the
press
shouted
it
at
him
from
every
corner
and
though
the
mount
vernon
street
conclave
agreed
with
the
press
yet
he
could
not
plead
ignorance
and
even
in
the
heat
of
the
conflict
he
never
cared
to
defend
the
coalition
boy
as
he
was
he
knew
enough
to
know
that
something
was
wrong
but
his
only
interest
was
the
election
day
after
day
the
general
court
balloted
and
the
boy
haunted
the
gallery
following
the
and
wondered
what
caleb
cushing
meant
by
calling
sumner
a
abolitionist
truly
the
difference
in
meaning
with
the
phrase
abolitionist
which
was
cushing
actual
expression
is
not
very
great
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
seemed
to
describe
sumner
to
the
boy
who
never
could
have
made
the
error
of
classing
garrison
and
sumner
together
or
mistaking
caleb
cushing
relation
to
either
temper
ran
high
at
that
moment
while
sumner
every
day
missed
his
election
by
only
one
or
two
votes
at
last
april
standing
among
the
silent
crowd
in
the
gallery
henry
heard
the
vote
announced
which
gave
sumner
the
needed
number
slipping
under
the
arms
of
the
bystanders
he
ran
home
as
hard
as
he
could
and
burst
into
the
where
sumner
was
seated
at
table
with
the
family
he
enjoyed
the
glory
of
telling
sumner
that
he
was
elected
it
was
probably
the
proudest
moment
in
the
life
of
either
the
next
day
when
the
boy
went
to
school
he
noticed
numbers
of
boys
and
men
in
the
streets
wearing
black
crepe
on
their
arm
he
knew
few
free
soil
boys
in
boston
his
acquaintances
were
what
he
called
so
he
thought
proper
to
tie
a
bit
of
white
silk
ribbon
round
his
own
arm
by
way
of
showing
that
his
friend
sumner
was
not
wholly
alone
this
little
piece
of
bravado
passed
unnoticed
no
one
even
cuffed
his
ears
but
in
later
life
he
was
a
little
puzzled
to
decide
which
symbol
was
the
more
correct
no
one
then
dreamed
of
four
years
war
but
every
one
dreamed
of
secession
the
symbol
for
either
might
well
be
matter
of
doubt
this
triumph
of
the
mount
vernon
street
conclave
capped
the
political
climax
the
boy
like
a
million
other
american
boys
was
a
politician
and
what
was
worse
fit
as
yet
to
be
nothing
else
he
should
have
been
like
his
grandfather
a
protege
of
george
washington
a
statesman
designated
by
destiny
with
nothing
to
do
but
look
directly
ahead
follow
orders
and
march
on
the
contrary
he
was
not
even
a
bostonian
he
felt
himself
shut
out
of
boston
as
though
he
were
an
exile
he
never
thought
of
himself
as
a
bostonian
he
never
looked
about
him
in
boston
as
boys
commonly
do
wherever
they
are
to
select
the
street
they
like
best
the
house
they
want
to
live
in
the
profession
they
mean
to
practise
always
he
felt
himself
somewhere
else
perhaps
in
washington
with
its
social
ease
perhaps
in
europe
and
he
watched
with
vague
unrest
from
the
quincy
hills
the
smoke
of
the
cunard
steamers
stretching
in
a
long
line
to
the
horizon
and
disappearing
every
other
saturday
or
whatever
the
day
might
be
as
though
the
steamers
were
offering
to
take
him
away
which
was
precisely
what
they
were
doing
had
these
ideas
been
unreasonable
influences
enough
were
at
hand
to
correct
them
but
the
point
of
the
whole
story
when
henry
adams
came
to
look
back
on
it
seemed
to
be
that
the
ideas
were
more
than
reasonable
they
were
the
logical
necessary
mathematical
result
of
conditions
old
as
history
and
fixed
as
fate
invariable
sequence
in
man
experience
the
only
idea
which
would
have
been
quite
unreasonable
scarcely
entered
his
mind
this
was
the
thought
of
going
westward
and
growing
up
with
the
country
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
fitted
for
going
west
made
no
objection
whatever
since
he
was
much
better
fitted
than
most
of
the
persons
that
went
the
convincing
reason
for
staying
in
the
east
was
that
he
had
there
every
advantage
over
the
west
he
could
not
go
wrong
the
west
must
inevitably
pay
an
enormous
tribute
to
boston
and
new
york
one
position
in
the
east
was
the
best
in
the
world
for
every
purpose
that
could
offer
an
object
for
going
westward
if
ever
in
history
men
had
been
able
to
calculate
on
a
certainty
for
a
lifetime
in
advance
the
citizens
of
the
great
eastern
seaports
could
do
it
in
when
their
railway
systems
were
already
laid
out
neither
to
a
politician
nor
to
a
nor
to
any
of
the
learned
professions
did
the
west
promise
any
certain
advantage
while
it
offered
uncertainties
in
plenty
at
any
other
moment
in
human
history
this
education
including
its
political
and
literary
bias
would
have
been
not
only
good
but
quite
the
best
society
had
always
welcomed
and
flattered
men
so
endowed
henry
adams
had
every
reason
to
be
well
pleased
with
it
and
not
with
himself
he
had
all
he
wanted
he
saw
no
reason
for
thinking
that
any
one
else
had
more
he
finished
with
school
not
very
brilliantly
but
without
finding
fault
with
the
sum
of
his
knowledge
probably
he
knew
more
than
his
father
or
his
grandfather
or
his
had
known
at
sixteen
years
old
only
on
looking
back
fifty
years
later
at
his
own
figure
in
and
pondering
on
the
needs
of
the
twentieth
century
he
wondered
whether
on
the
whole
the
boy
of
stood
nearer
to
the
thought
of
or
to
that
of
the
year
he
found
himself
unable
to
give
a
sure
answer
the
calculation
was
clouded
by
the
undetermined
values
of
thought
but
the
story
will
show
his
reasons
for
thinking
that
in
essentials
like
religion
ethics
philosophy
in
history
literature
art
in
the
concepts
of
all
science
except
perhaps
mathematics
the
american
boy
of
stood
nearer
the
year
than
to
the
year
the
education
he
had
received
bore
little
relation
to
the
education
he
needed
speaking
as
an
american
of
he
had
as
yet
no
education
at
all
he
knew
not
even
where
or
how
to
begin
chapter
iv
harvard
college
one
day
in
june
young
adams
walked
for
the
last
time
down
the
steps
of
dixwell
school
in
boylston
place
and
felt
no
sensation
but
one
of
unqualified
joy
that
this
experience
was
ended
never
before
or
afterwards
in
his
life
did
he
close
a
period
so
long
as
four
years
without
some
sensation
of
loss
some
sentiment
of
habit
but
school
was
what
in
after
life
he
commonly
heard
his
friends
denounce
as
an
intolerable
bore
he
was
born
too
old
for
it
the
same
thing
could
be
said
of
most
new
england
boys
mentally
they
never
were
boys
their
education
as
men
should
have
begun
at
ten
years
old
they
were
fully
five
years
more
mature
than
the
english
or
european
boy
for
whom
schools
were
made
for
the
purposes
of
future
advancement
as
afterwards
appeared
these
first
six
years
of
a
possible
education
were
wasted
in
doing
imperfectly
what
might
have
been
done
perfectly
in
one
and
in
any
case
would
have
had
small
value
the
next
regular
step
was
harvard
college
he
was
more
than
glad
to
go
for
generation
after
generation
adamses
and
brookses
and
boylstons
and
gorhams
had
gone
to
harvard
college
and
although
none
of
them
as
far
as
known
had
ever
done
any
good
there
or
thought
himself
the
better
for
it
custom
social
ties
convenience
and
above
all
economy
kept
each
generation
in
the
track
any
other
education
would
have
required
a
serious
effort
but
no
one
took
harvard
college
seriously
all
went
there
because
their
friends
went
there
and
the
college
was
their
ideal
of
social
harvard
college
as
far
as
it
educated
at
all
was
a
mild
and
liberal
school
which
sent
young
men
into
the
world
with
all
they
needed
to
make
respectable
citizens
and
something
of
what
they
wanted
to
make
useful
ones
leaders
of
men
it
never
tried
to
make
its
ideals
were
altogether
different
the
unitarian
clergy
had
given
to
the
college
a
character
of
moderation
balance
judgment
restraint
what
the
french
called
mesure
excellent
traits
which
the
college
attained
with
singular
success
so
that
its
graduates
could
commonly
be
recognized
by
the
stamp
but
such
a
type
of
character
rarely
lent
itself
to
autobiography
in
effect
the
school
created
a
type
but
not
a
will
four
years
of
harvard
college
if
successful
resulted
in
an
autobiographical
blank
a
mind
on
which
only
a
had
been
stamped
the
stamp
as
such
things
went
was
a
good
one
the
chief
wonder
of
education
is
that
it
does
not
ruin
everybody
concerned
in
it
teachers
and
taught
sometimes
in
after
life
adams
debated
whether
in
fact
it
had
not
ruined
him
and
most
of
his
companions
but
disappointment
apart
harvard
college
was
probably
less
hurtful
than
any
other
university
then
in
existence
it
taught
little
and
that
little
ill
but
it
left
the
mind
open
free
from
bias
ignorant
of
facts
but
docile
the
graduate
had
few
strong
prejudices
he
knew
little
but
his
mind
remained
supple
ready
to
receive
knowledge
what
caused
the
boy
most
disappointment
was
the
little
he
got
from
his
mates
speaking
exactly
he
got
less
than
nothing
a
result
common
enough
in
education
yet
the
college
catalogue
for
the
years
to
shows
a
list
of
names
rather
distinguished
in
their
time
alexander
agassiz
and
phillips
brooks
led
it
richardson
and
holmes
helped
to
close
it
as
a
rule
the
most
promising
of
all
die
early
and
never
get
their
names
into
a
dictionary
of
contemporaries
which
seems
to
be
the
only
popular
standard
of
success
many
died
in
the
war
adams
knew
them
all
more
or
less
he
felt
as
much
regard
and
quite
as
much
respect
for
them
then
as
he
did
after
they
won
great
names
and
were
objects
of
a
vastly
wider
respect
but
as
help
towards
education
he
got
nothing
whatever
from
them
or
they
from
him
until
long
after
they
had
left
college
possibly
the
fault
was
his
but
one
would
like
to
know
how
many
others
shared
it
accident
counts
for
much
in
companionship
as
in
marriage
life
offers
perhaps
only
a
score
of
possible
companions
and
it
is
mere
chance
whether
they
meet
as
early
as
school
or
college
but
it
is
more
than
a
chance
that
boys
brought
up
together
under
like
conditions
have
nothing
to
give
each
other
the
class
of
to
which
henry
adams
belonged
was
a
typical
collection
of
young
new
englanders
quietly
penetrating
and
aggressively
commonplace
free
from
meannesses
jealousies
intrigues
enthusiasms
and
passions
not
exceptionally
quick
not
consciously
skeptical
singularly
indifferent
to
display
artifice
florid
expression
but
not
hostile
to
it
when
it
amused
them
distrustful
of
themselves
but
little
disposed
to
trust
any
one
else
with
not
much
humor
of
their
own
but
full
of
readiness
to
enjoy
the
humor
of
others
negative
to
a
degree
that
in
the
long
run
became
positive
and
triumphant
not
harsh
in
manners
or
judgment
rather
liberal
and
they
were
still
as
a
body
the
most
formidable
critics
one
would
care
to
meet
in
a
long
life
exposed
to
criticism
they
never
flattered
seldom
praised
free
from
vanity
they
were
not
intolerant
of
it
but
they
were
objectiveness
itself
their
attitude
was
a
law
of
nature
their
judgment
beyond
appeal
not
an
act
either
of
intellect
or
emotion
or
of
will
but
a
sort
of
gravitation
this
was
harvard
college
incarnate
but
even
for
harvard
college
the
class
of
was
somewhat
extreme
of
unity
this
band
of
nearly
one
hundred
young
men
had
no
keen
sense
but
they
had
equally
little
energy
of
repulsion
they
were
pleasant
to
live
with
and
above
the
average
of
students
german
french
english
or
what
not
but
chiefly
because
each
individual
appeared
satisfied
to
stand
alone
it
seemed
a
sign
of
force
yet
to
stand
alone
is
quite
natural
when
one
has
no
passions
still
easier
when
one
has
no
pains
into
this
unusually
dissolvent
medium
chance
insisted
on
enlarging
henry
adams
education
by
tossing
a
trio
of
virginians
as
little
fitted
for
it
as
sioux
indians
to
a
treadmill
by
some
further
affinity
these
three
outsiders
fell
into
relation
with
the
bostonians
among
whom
adams
as
a
schoolboy
belonged
and
in
the
end
with
adams
himself
although
they
and
he
knew
well
how
thin
an
edge
of
friendship
separated
them
in
from
mortal
enmity
one
of
the
virginians
was
the
son
of
colonel
robert
lee
of
the
second
united
states
cavalry
the
two
others
who
seemed
instinctively
to
form
a
staff
for
lee
were
from
petersburg
a
fourth
outsider
came
from
cincinnati
and
was
half
kentuckian
anderson
longworth
on
the
side
for
the
first
time
adams
education
brought
him
in
contact
with
new
types
and
taught
him
their
values
he
saw
the
new
england
type
measure
itself
with
another
and
he
was
part
of
the
process
lee
known
through
life
as
roony
was
a
virginian
of
the
eighteenth
century
much
as
henry
adams
was
a
bostonian
of
the
same
age
roony
lee
had
changed
little
from
the
type
of
his
grandfather
light
horse
harry
tall
largely
built
handsome
genial
with
liberal
virginian
openness
towards
all
he
liked
he
had
also
the
virginian
habit
of
command
and
took
leadership
as
his
natural
habit
no
one
cared
to
contest
it
none
of
the
new
englanders
wanted
command
for
a
year
at
least
lee
was
the
most
popular
and
prominent
young
man
in
his
class
but
then
seemed
slowly
to
drop
into
the
background
the
habit
of
command
was
not
enough
and
the
virginian
had
little
else
he
was
simple
beyond
analysis
so
simple
that
even
the
simple
new
england
student
could
not
realize
him
no
one
knew
enough
to
know
how
ignorant
he
was
how
childlike
how
helpless
before
the
relative
complexity
of
a
school
as
an
animal
the
southerner
seemed
to
have
every
advantage
but
even
as
an
animal
he
steadily
lost
ground
the
lesson
in
education
was
vital
to
these
young
men
who
within
ten
years
killed
each
other
by
scores
in
the
act
of
testing
their
college
conclusions
strictly
the
southerner
had
no
mind
he
had
temperament
he
was
not
a
scholar
he
had
no
intellectual
training
he
could
not
analyze
an
idea
and
he
could
not
even
conceive
of
admitting
two
but
in
life
one
could
get
along
very
well
without
ideas
if
one
had
only
the
social
instinct
dozens
of
eminent
statesmen
were
men
of
lee
type
and
maintained
themselves
well
enough
in
the
legislature
but
college
was
a
sharper
test
the
virginian
was
weak
in
vice
itself
though
the
bostonian
was
hardly
a
master
of
crime
the
habits
of
neither
were
good
both
were
apt
to
drink
hard
and
to
live
low
lives
but
the
bostonian
suffered
less
than
the
virginian
commonly
the
bostonian
could
take
some
care
of
himself
even
in
his
worst
stages
while
the
virginian
became
quarrelsome
and
dangerous
when
a
virginian
had
brooded
a
few
days
over
an
imaginary
grief
and
substantial
whiskey
none
of
his
northern
friends
could
be
sure
that
he
might
not
be
waiting
round
the
corner
with
a
knife
or
pistol
to
revenge
insult
by
the
dry
light
of
delirium
tremens
and
when
things
reached
this
condition
lee
had
to
exhaust
his
authority
over
his
own
staff
lee
was
a
gentleman
of
the
old
school
and
as
every
one
knows
gentlemen
of
the
old
school
drank
almost
as
much
as
gentlemen
of
the
new
school
but
this
was
not
his
trouble
he
was
sober
even
in
the
excessive
violence
of
political
feeling
in
those
years
he
kept
his
temper
and
his
friends
under
control
adams
liked
the
virginians
no
one
was
more
obnoxious
to
them
by
name
and
prejudice
yet
their
friendship
was
unbroken
and
even
warm
at
a
moment
when
the
immediate
future
posed
no
problem
in
education
so
vital
as
the
relative
energy
and
endurance
of
north
and
south
this
momentary
contact
with
southern
character
was
a
sort
of
education
for
its
own
sake
but
this
was
not
all
no
doubt
the
of
the
yankee
which
tended
naturally
to
was
flattered
by
gaining
the
slow
conviction
that
the
southerner
with
his
limitations
was
as
little
fit
to
succeed
in
the
struggle
of
modern
life
as
though
he
were
still
a
maker
of
stone
axes
living
in
caves
and
hunting
the
bos
primigenius
and
that
every
quality
in
which
he
was
strong
made
him
weaker
but
adams
had
begun
to
fear
that
even
in
this
respect
one
type
might
not
differ
deeply
from
another
roony
lee
had
changed
little
from
the
virginian
of
a
century
before
but
adams
was
himself
a
good
deal
nearer
the
type
of
his
than
to
that
of
a
railway
superintendent
he
was
little
more
fit
than
the
virginians
to
deal
with
a
future
america
which
showed
no
fancy
for
the
past
already
northern
society
betrayed
a
preference
for
economists
over
diplomats
or
soldiers
one
might
even
call
it
a
jealousy
against
which
two
types
had
little
chance
to
live
and
which
they
had
in
common
to
fear
nothing
short
of
this
curious
sympathy
could
have
brought
into
close
relations
two
young
men
so
hostile
as
roony
lee
and
henry
adams
but
the
chief
difference
between
them
as
collegians
consisted
only
in
their
difference
of
scholarship
lee
was
a
total
failure
adams
a
partial
one
both
failed
but
lee
felt
his
failure
more
sensibly
so
that
he
gladly
seized
the
chance
of
escape
by
accepting
a
commission
offered
him
by
general
winfield
scott
in
the
force
then
being
organized
against
the
mormons
he
asked
adams
to
write
his
letter
of
acceptance
which
flattered
adams
vanity
more
than
any
northern
compliment
could
do
because
in
days
of
violent
political
bitterness
it
showed
a
certain
amount
of
good
temper
the
diplomat
felt
his
profession
if
the
student
got
little
from
his
mates
he
got
little
more
from
his
masters
the
four
years
passed
at
college
were
for
his
purposes
wasted
harvard
college
was
a
good
school
but
at
bottom
what
the
boy
disliked
most
was
any
school
at
all
he
did
not
want
to
be
one
in
a
hundred
one
per
cent
of
an
education
he
regarded
himself
as
the
only
person
for
whom
his
education
had
value
and
he
wanted
the
whole
of
it
he
got
barely
half
of
an
average
long
afterwards
when
the
devious
path
of
life
led
him
back
to
teach
in
his
turn
what
no
student
naturally
cared
or
needed
to
know
he
diverted
some
dreary
hours
of
by
looking
up
his
record
in
the
and
found
himself
graded
precisely
in
the
middle
in
the
one
branch
he
most
needed
mathematics
barring
the
few
first
scholars
failure
was
so
nearly
universal
that
no
attempt
at
grading
could
have
had
value
and
whether
he
stood
fortieth
or
ninetieth
must
have
been
an
accident
or
the
personal
favor
of
the
professor
here
his
education
failed
lamentably
at
best
he
could
never
have
been
a
mathematician
at
worst
he
would
never
have
cared
to
be
one
but
he
needed
to
read
mathematics
like
any
other
universal
language
and
he
never
reached
the
alphabet
beyond
two
or
three
greek
plays
the
student
got
nothing
from
the
ancient
languages
beyond
some
incoherent
theories
of
and
protection
he
got
little
from
political
economy
he
could
not
afterwards
remember
to
have
heard
the
name
of
karl
marx
mentioned
or
the
title
of
capital
he
was
equally
ignorant
of
auguste
comte
these
were
the
two
writers
of
his
time
who
most
influenced
its
thought
the
bit
of
practical
teaching
he
afterwards
reviewed
with
most
curiosity
was
the
course
in
chemistry
which
taught
him
a
number
of
theories
that
befogged
his
mind
for
a
lifetime
the
only
teaching
that
appealed
to
his
imagination
was
a
course
of
lectures
by
louis
agassiz
on
the
glacial
period
and
paleontology
which
had
more
influence
on
his
curiosity
than
the
rest
of
the
college
instruction
altogether
the
entire
work
of
the
four
years
could
have
been
easily
put
into
the
work
of
any
four
months
in
after
life
harvard
college
was
a
negative
force
and
negative
forces
have
value
slowly
it
weakened
the
violent
political
bias
of
childhood
not
by
putting
interests
in
its
place
but
by
mental
habits
which
had
no
bias
at
all
it
would
also
have
weakened
the
literary
bias
if
adams
had
been
capable
of
finding
other
amusement
but
the
climate
kept
him
steady
to
desultory
and
useless
reading
till
he
had
run
through
libraries
of
volumes
which
he
forgot
even
to
their
rather
by
instinct
than
by
guidance
he
turned
to
writing
and
his
professors
or
tutors
occasionally
gave
his
english
composition
a
hesitating
approval
but
in
that
branch
as
in
all
the
rest
even
when
he
made
a
long
struggle
for
recognition
he
never
convinced
his
teachers
that
his
abilities
at
their
best
warranted
placing
him
on
the
among
the
first
third
of
his
class
instructors
generally
reach
a
fairly
accurate
gauge
of
their
scholars
powers
henry
adams
himself
held
the
opinion
that
his
instructors
were
very
nearly
right
and
when
he
became
a
professor
in
his
turn
and
made
mortifying
mistakes
in
ranking
his
scholars
he
still
obstinately
insisted
that
on
the
whole
he
was
not
far
wrong
student
or
professor
he
accepted
the
negative
standard
because
it
was
the
standard
of
the
school
he
never
knew
what
other
students
thought
of
it
or
what
they
thought
they
gained
from
it
nor
would
their
opinion
have
much
affected
his
from
the
first
he
wanted
to
be
done
with
it
and
stood
watching
vaguely
for
a
path
and
a
direction
the
world
outside
seemed
large
but
the
paths
that
led
into
it
were
not
many
and
lay
mostly
through
boston
where
he
did
not
want
to
go
as
it
happened
by
pure
chance
the
first
door
of
escape
that
seemed
to
offer
a
hope
led
into
germany
and
james
russell
lowell
opened
it
lowell
on
succeeding
longfellow
as
professor
of
had
duly
gone
to
germany
and
had
brought
back
whatever
he
found
to
bring
the
literary
world
then
agreed
that
truth
survived
in
germany
alone
and
carlyle
matthew
arnold
renan
emerson
with
scores
of
popular
followers
taught
the
german
faith
the
literary
world
had
revolted
against
the
yoke
of
coming
capitalism
its
its
bank
directors
and
its
railway
magnates
thackeray
and
dickens
followed
balzac
in
scratching
and
biting
the
unfortunate
middle
class
with
savage
much
as
the
middle
class
had
scratched
and
bitten
the
church
and
court
for
a
hundred
years
before
the
middle
class
had
the
power
and
held
its
coal
and
iron
well
in
hand
but
the
satirists
and
idealists
seized
the
press
and
as
they
were
agreed
that
the
second
empire
was
a
disgrace
to
france
and
a
danger
to
england
they
turned
to
germany
because
at
that
moment
germany
was
neither
economical
nor
military
and
a
hundred
years
behind
western
europe
in
the
simplicity
of
its
standard
german
thought
method
honesty
and
even
taste
became
the
standards
of
scholarship
goethe
was
raised
to
the
rank
of
shakespeare
kant
ranked
as
a
above
plato
all
serious
scholars
were
obliged
to
become
german
for
german
thought
was
revolutionizing
criticism
lowell
had
followed
the
rest
not
very
enthusiastically
but
with
sufficient
conviction
and
invited
his
scholars
to
join
him
adams
was
glad
to
accept
the
invitation
rather
for
the
sake
of
cultivating
lowell
than
germany
but
still
in
perfect
good
faith
it
was
the
first
serious
attempt
he
had
made
to
direct
his
own
education
and
he
was
sure
of
getting
some
education
out
of
it
not
perhaps
anything
that
he
expected
but
at
least
a
path
singularly
circuitous
and
excessively
wasteful
of
energy
the
path
proved
to
be
but
the
student
could
never
see
what
other
was
open
to
him
he
could
have
done
no
better
had
he
foreseen
every
stage
of
his
coming
life
and
he
would
probably
have
done
worse
the
preliminary
step
was
pure
gain
james
russell
lowell
had
brought
back
from
germany
the
only
new
and
valuable
part
of
its
universities
the
habit
of
allowing
students
to
read
with
him
privately
in
his
study
adams
asked
the
privilege
and
used
it
to
read
a
little
and
to
talk
a
great
deal
for
the
personal
contact
pleased
and
flattered
him
as
that
of
older
men
ought
to
flatter
and
please
the
young
even
when
they
altogether
exaggerate
its
value
lowell
was
a
new
element
in
the
boy
life
as
practical
a
new
englander
as
any
he
leaned
towards
the
concord
faith
rather
than
towards
boston
where
he
properly
belonged
for
concord
in
the
dark
days
of
glowed
with
pure
light
adams
approached
it
in
much
the
same
spirit
as
he
would
have
entered
a
gothic
cathedral
for
he
well
knew
that
the
priests
regarded
him
as
only
a
worm
to
the
concord
church
all
adamses
were
minds
of
dust
and
emptiness
devoid
of
feeling
poetry
or
imagination
little
higher
than
the
common
scourings
of
state
street
politicians
of
doubtful
honesty
natures
of
narrow
scope
and
already
at
eighteen
years
old
henry
had
begun
to
feel
uncertainty
about
so
many
matters
more
important
than
adamses
that
his
mind
rebelled
against
no
discipline
merely
personal
and
he
was
ready
to
admit
his
unworthiness
if
only
he
might
penetrate
the
shrine
the
influence
of
harvard
college
was
beginning
to
have
its
effect
he
was
slipping
away
from
fixed
principles
from
mount
vernon
street
from
quincy
from
the
eighteenth
century
and
his
first
steps
led
toward
concord
he
never
reached
concord
and
to
concord
church
he
like
the
rest
of
mankind
who
accepted
a
material
universe
remained
always
an
insect
or
something
much
lower
a
man
it
was
surely
no
fault
of
his
that
the
universe
seemed
to
him
real
perhaps
as
emerson
justly
said
it
was
so
in
spite
of
the
effort
of
a
lifetime
he
perpetually
fell
back
into
the
heresy
that
if
anything
universal
was
unreal
it
was
himself
and
not
the
appearances
it
was
the
poet
and
not
the
banker
it
was
his
own
thought
not
the
thing
that
moved
it
he
did
not
lack
the
wish
to
be
transcendental
concord
seemed
to
him
at
one
time
more
real
than
quincy
yet
in
truth
russell
lowell
was
as
little
transcendental
as
beacon
street
from
him
the
boy
got
no
revolutionary
thought
whatever
objective
or
subjective
as
they
used
to
call
it
but
he
got
encouragement
to
do
what
amused
him
which
consisted
in
passing
two
years
in
europe
after
finishing
the
four
years
of
cambridge
the
result
seemed
small
in
proportion
to
the
effort
but
it
was
the
only
positive
result
he
could
ever
trace
to
the
influence
of
harvard
college
and
he
had
grave
doubts
whether
harvard
college
influenced
even
that
negative
results
in
plenty
he
could
trace
but
he
tended
towards
negation
on
his
own
account
as
one
side
of
the
new
england
mind
had
always
done
and
even
there
he
could
never
feel
sure
that
harvard
college
had
more
than
reflected
a
weakness
in
his
opinion
the
education
was
not
serious
but
in
truth
hardly
any
boston
student
took
it
seriously
and
none
of
them
seemed
sure
that
president
walker
himself
or
president
felton
after
him
took
it
more
seriously
than
the
students
for
them
all
the
college
offered
chiefly
advantages
vulgarly
called
social
rather
than
mental
unluckily
for
this
particular
boy
social
advantages
were
his
only
capital
in
life
of
money
he
had
not
much
of
mind
not
more
but
he
could
be
quite
certain
that
barring
his
own
faults
his
social
position
would
never
be
questioned
what
he
needed
was
a
career
in
which
social
position
had
value
never
in
his
life
would
he
have
to
explain
who
he
was
never
would
he
have
need
of
acquaintance
to
strengthen
his
social
standing
but
he
needed
greatly
some
one
to
show
him
how
to
use
the
acquaintance
he
cared
to
make
he
made
no
acquaintance
in
college
which
proved
to
have
the
smallest
use
in
after
life
all
his
boston
friends
he
knew
before
or
would
have
known
in
any
case
and
contact
of
bostonian
with
bostonian
was
the
last
education
these
young
men
needed
cordial
and
intimate
as
their
college
relations
were
they
all
flew
off
in
different
directions
the
moment
they
took
their
degrees
harvard
college
remained
a
tie
indeed
but
a
tie
little
stronger
than
beacon
street
and
not
so
strong
as
state
street
strangers
might
perhaps
gain
something
from
the
college
if
they
were
hard
pressed
for
social
connections
a
student
like
richardson
who
came
from
far
away
new
orleans
and
had
his
career
before
him
to
chase
rather
than
to
guide
might
make
valuable
friendships
at
college
certainly
adams
made
no
acquaintance
there
that
he
valued
in
after
life
so
much
as
richardson
but
still
more
certainly
the
college
relation
had
little
to
do
with
the
later
friendship
life
is
a
narrow
valley
and
the
roads
run
close
together
adams
would
have
attached
himself
to
richardson
in
any
case
as
he
attached
himself
to
john
lafarge
or
augustus
gaudens
or
clarence
king
or
john
hay
none
of
whom
were
at
harvard
college
the
valley
of
life
grew
more
and
more
narrow
with
years
and
certain
men
with
common
tastes
were
bound
to
come
together
adams
knew
only
that
he
would
have
felt
himself
on
a
more
equal
footing
with
them
had
he
been
less
ignorant
and
had
he
not
thrown
away
ten
years
of
early
life
in
acquiring
what
he
might
have
acquired
in
one
socially
or
intellectually
the
college
was
for
him
negative
and
in
some
ways
mischievous
the
most
tolerant
man
of
the
world
could
not
see
good
in
the
lower
habits
of
the
students
but
the
vices
were
less
harmful
than
the
virtues
the
habit
of
drinking
though
the
mere
recollection
of
it
made
him
doubt
his
own
veracity
so
fantastic
it
seemed
in
later
life
may
have
done
no
great
or
permanent
harm
but
the
habit
of
looking
at
life
as
a
social
relation
an
affair
of
society
did
no
good
it
cultivated
a
weakness
which
needed
no
cultivation
if
it
had
helped
to
make
men
of
the
world
or
give
the
manners
and
instincts
of
any
profession
such
as
temper
patience
courtesy
or
a
faculty
of
profiting
by
the
social
defects
of
opponents
it
would
have
been
education
better
worth
having
than
mathematics
or
languages
but
so
far
as
it
helped
to
make
anything
it
helped
only
to
make
the
college
standard
permanent
through
life
the
bostonian
educated
at
harvard
college
remained
a
collegian
if
he
stuck
only
to
what
the
college
gave
him
if
parents
went
on
generation
after
generation
sending
their
children
to
harvard
college
for
the
sake
of
its
social
advantages
they
perpetuated
an
inferior
social
type
quite
as
as
the
oxford
type
for
success
in
the
next
generation
luckily
the
old
social
standard
of
the
college
as
president
walker
or
james
russell
lowell
still
showed
it
was
admirable
and
if
it
had
little
practical
value
or
personal
influence
on
the
mass
of
students
at
least
it
preserved
the
tradition
for
those
who
liked
it
the
harvard
graduate
was
neither
american
nor
european
nor
even
wholly
yankee
his
admirers
were
few
and
critics
his
many
perhaps
his
worst
weakness
was
his
and
but
his
ambitions
social
or
intellectual
were
necessarily
cheap
even
though
they
might
be
negative
afraid
of
such
serious
risks
and
still
more
afraid
of
personal
ridicule
he
seldom
made
a
great
failure
of
life
and
nearly
always
led
a
life
more
or
less
worth
living
so
henry
adams
well
aware
that
he
could
not
succeed
as
a
scholar
and
finding
his
social
position
beyond
improvement
or
need
of
effort
betook
himself
to
the
single
ambition
which
otherwise
would
scarcely
have
seemed
a
true
outcome
of
the
college
though
it
was
the
last
remnant
of
the
old
unitarian
supremacy
he
took
to
the
pen
he
wrote
the
college
magazine
printed
his
work
and
the
college
societies
listened
to
his
addresses
lavish
of
praise
the
readers
were
not
the
audiences
too
listened
in
silence
but
this
was
all
the
encouragement
any
harvard
collegian
had
a
reasonable
hope
to
receive
grave
silence
was
a
form
of
patience
that
meant
possible
future
acceptance
and
henry
adams
went
on
writing
no
one
cared
enough
to
criticise
except
himself
who
soon
began
to
suffer
from
reaching
his
own
limits
he
found
that
he
could
not
be
this
or
that
or
the
other
always
precisely
the
things
he
wanted
to
be
he
had
not
wit
or
scope
or
force
judges
always
ranked
him
beneath
a
rival
if
he
had
any
and
he
believed
the
judges
were
right
his
work
seemed
to
him
thin
commonplace
feeble
at
times
he
felt
his
own
weakness
so
fatally
that
he
could
not
go
on
when
he
had
nothing
to
say
he
could
not
say
it
and
he
found
that
he
had
very
little
to
say
at
best
much
that
he
then
wrote
must
be
still
in
existence
in
print
or
manuscript
though
he
never
cared
to
see
it
again
for
he
felt
no
doubt
that
it
was
in
reality
just
what
he
thought
it
at
best
it
showed
only
a
feeling
for
form
an
instinct
of
exclusion
nothing
shocked
not
even
its
weakness
inevitably
an
effort
leads
to
an
ambition
creates
it
and
at
that
time
the
ambition
of
the
literary
student
which
almost
took
place
of
the
regular
prizes
of
scholarship
was
that
of
being
chosen
as
the
representative
of
his
class
class
orator
at
the
close
of
their
course
this
was
political
as
well
as
literary
success
and
precisely
the
sort
of
combination
that
fascinated
an
eighteenth
century
boy
the
idea
lurked
in
his
mind
at
first
as
a
dream
in
no
way
serious
or
even
possible
for
he
stood
outside
the
number
of
what
were
known
as
popular
men
year
by
year
his
position
seemed
to
improve
or
perhaps
his
rivals
disappeared
until
at
last
to
his
own
great
astonishment
he
found
himself
a
candidate
the
habits
of
the
college
permitted
no
active
candidacy
he
and
his
rivals
had
not
a
word
to
say
for
or
against
themselves
and
he
was
never
even
consulted
on
the
subject
he
was
not
present
at
any
of
the
proceedings
and
how
it
happened
he
never
could
quite
divine
but
it
did
happen
that
one
evening
on
returning
from
boston
he
received
notice
of
his
election
after
a
very
close
contest
as
class
orator
over
the
head
of
the
first
scholar
who
was
undoubtedly
a
better
orator
and
a
more
popular
man
in
politics
the
success
of
the
poorer
candidate
is
common
enough
and
henry
adams
was
a
fairly
trained
politician
but
he
never
understood
how
he
managed
to
defeat
not
only
a
more
capable
but
a
more
popular
rival
to
him
the
election
seemed
a
miracle
this
was
no
his
head
was
as
clear
as
ever
it
was
in
an
indifferent
canvass
and
he
knew
his
rivals
and
their
following
as
well
as
he
knew
himself
what
he
did
not
know
even
after
four
years
of
education
was
harvard
college
what
he
could
never
measure
was
the
bewildering
impersonality
of
the
men
who
at
twenty
years
old
seemed
to
set
no
value
either
on
official
or
personal
standards
here
were
nearly
a
hundred
young
men
who
had
lived
together
intimately
during
four
of
the
most
impressionable
years
of
life
and
who
not
only
once
but
again
and
again
in
different
ways
deliberately
seriously
dispassionately
chose
as
their
representatives
precisely
those
of
their
companions
who
seemed
least
to
represent
them
as
far
as
these
orators
and
marshals
had
any
position
at
all
in
a
collegiate
sense
it
was
that
of
indifference
to
the
college
henry
adams
never
professed
the
smallest
faith
in
universities
of
any
kind
either
as
boy
or
man
nor
had
he
the
faintest
admiration
for
the
university
graduate
either
in
europe
or
in
america
as
a
collegian
he
was
only
known
apart
from
his
fellows
by
his
habit
of
standing
outside
the
college
and
yet
the
singular
fact
remained
that
this
commonplace
body
of
young
men
chose
him
repeatedly
to
express
his
and
their
commonplaces
secretly
of
course
the
successful
candidate
flattered
himself
and
them
with
the
hope
that
they
might
perhaps
not
be
so
commonplace
as
they
thought
themselves
but
this
was
only
another
proof
that
all
were
identical
they
saw
in
him
a
representative
the
kind
of
representative
they
wanted
and
he
saw
in
them
the
most
formidable
array
of
judges
he
could
ever
meet
like
so
many
mirrors
of
himself
an
infinite
reflection
of
his
own
shortcomings
all
the
same
the
choice
was
flattering
so
flattering
that
it
actually
shocked
his
vanity
and
would
have
shocked
it
more
if
possible
had
he
known
that
it
was
to
be
the
only
flattery
of
the
sort
he
was
ever
to
receive
the
function
of
class
day
was
in
the
eyes
of
of
the
students
altogether
the
most
important
of
the
college
and
the
figure
of
the
orator
was
the
most
conspicuous
in
the
function
unlike
the
orators
at
regular
commencements
the
class
day
orator
stood
alone
or
had
only
the
poet
for
rival
crowded
into
the
large
church
the
students
their
families
friends
aunts
uncles
and
chaperones
attended
all
the
girls
of
sixteen
or
twenty
who
wanted
to
show
their
summer
dresses
or
fresh
complexions
and
there
for
an
hour
or
two
in
a
heat
that
might
have
melted
bronze
they
listened
to
an
orator
and
a
poet
in
clergyman
gowns
reciting
such
platitudes
as
their
own
experience
and
their
mild
censors
permitted
them
to
utter
what
henry
adams
said
in
his
class
oration
of
he
soon
forgot
to
the
last
word
nor
had
it
the
least
value
for
education
but
he
naturally
remembered
what
was
said
of
it
he
remembered
especially
one
of
his
eminent
uncles
or
relations
remarking
that
as
the
work
of
so
young
a
man
the
oration
was
singularly
wanting
in
enthusiasm
the
young
man
always
in
search
of
education
asked
himself
whether
setting
rhetoric
aside
this
absence
of
enthusiasm
was
a
defect
or
a
merit
since
in
either
case
it
was
all
that
harvard
college
taught
and
all
that
the
hundred
young
men
whom
he
was
trying
to
represent
expressed
another
comment
threw
more
light
on
the
effect
of
the
college
education
one
of
the
elderly
gentlemen
noticed
the
perfect
indeed
if
harvard
college
gave
nothing
else
it
gave
calm
for
four
years
each
student
had
been
obliged
to
figure
daily
before
dozens
of
young
men
who
knew
each
other
to
the
last
fibre
one
had
done
little
but
read
papers
to
societies
or
act
comedy
in
the
hasty
pudding
not
to
speak
of
regular
exercises
and
no
audience
in
future
life
would
ever
be
so
intimately
and
terribly
intelligent
as
these
of
the
graduates
would
rather
have
addressed
the
council
of
trent
or
the
british
parliament
than
have
acted
sir
anthony
absolute
or
ollapod
before
a
gala
audience
of
the
hasty
pudding
was
the
strongest
part
of
harvard
college
which
certainly
taught
men
to
stand
alone
so
that
nothing
seemed
stranger
to
its
graduates
than
the
paroxysms
of
terror
before
the
public
which
often
overcame
the
graduates
of
european
universities
whether
this
was
or
was
not
education
henry
adams
never
knew
he
was
ready
to
stand
up
before
any
audience
in
america
or
europe
with
nerves
rather
steadier
for
the
excitement
but
whether
he
should
ever
have
anything
to
say
remained
to
be
proved
as
yet
he
knew
nothing
education
had
not
begun
chapter
v
berlin
a
fourth
child
has
the
strength
of
his
weakness
being
of
no
great
value
he
may
throw
himself
away
if
he
likes
and
never
be
missed
charles
francis
adams
the
father
felt
no
love
for
europe
which
as
he
and
all
the
world
agreed
unfitted
americans
for
america
a
captious
critic
might
have
replied
that
all
the
success
he
or
his
father
or
his
grandfather
achieved
was
chiefly
due
to
the
field
that
europe
gave
them
and
it
was
more
than
likely
that
without
the
help
of
europe
they
would
have
all
remained
local
politicians
or
lawyers
like
their
neighbors
to
the
end
strictly
followed
the
rule
would
have
obliged
them
never
to
quit
quincy
and
in
fact
so
much
more
timid
are
parents
for
their
children
than
for
themselves
that
and
adams
would
have
been
content
to
see
their
children
remain
forever
in
mount
vernon
street
unexposed
to
the
temptations
of
europe
could
they
have
relied
on
the
moral
influences
of
boston
itself
although
the
parents
little
knew
what
took
place
under
their
eyes
even
the
mothers
saw
enough
to
make
them
uneasy
perhaps
their
dread
of
vice
haunting
past
and
present
worried
them
less
than
their
dread
of
or
who
might
not
fit
into
the
somewhat
narrow
quarters
of
home
on
all
sides
were
risks
every
year
some
young
person
alarmed
the
parental
heart
even
in
boston
and
although
the
temptations
of
europe
were
irresistible
removal
from
the
temptations
of
boston
might
be
imperative
the
boy
henry
wanted
to
go
to
europe
he
seemed
well
behaved
when
any
one
was
looking
at
him
he
observed
conventions
when
he
could
not
escape
them
he
was
never
quarrelsome
towards
a
superior
his
morals
were
apparently
good
and
his
moral
principles
if
he
had
any
were
not
known
to
be
bad
above
all
he
was
timid
and
showed
a
certain
sense
of
when
in
public
view
what
he
was
at
heart
no
one
could
say
least
of
all
himself
but
he
was
probably
human
and
no
worse
than
some
others
therefore
when
he
presented
to
an
exceedingly
indulgent
father
and
mother
his
request
to
begin
at
a
german
university
the
study
of
the
civil
law
although
neither
he
nor
they
knew
what
the
civil
law
was
or
any
reason
for
his
studying
it
the
parents
dutifully
consented
and
walked
with
him
down
to
the
at
quincy
to
bid
him
with
a
smile
which
he
almost
thought
a
tear
whether
the
boy
deserved
such
indulgence
or
was
worth
it
he
knew
no
more
than
they
or
than
a
professor
at
harvard
college
but
whether
worthy
or
not
he
began
his
third
or
fourth
attempt
at
education
in
november
by
sailing
on
the
steamer
persia
the
pride
of
captain
judkins
and
the
cunard
line
the
newest
largest
and
fastest
steamship
afloat
he
was
not
alone
several
of
his
college
companions
sailed
with
him
and
the
world
looked
cheerful
enough
until
on
the
third
day
the
world
as
far
as
concerned
the
young
man
ran
into
a
heavy
storm
he
learned
then
a
lesson
that
stood
by
him
better
than
any
university
teaching
ever
did
the
meaning
of
a
november
gale
on
the
which
for
mere
physical
misery
passed
endurance
the
subject
offered
him
material
for
none
but
serious
treatment
he
could
never
see
the
humor
of
but
it
united
itself
with
a
great
variety
of
other
impressions
which
made
the
first
month
of
travel
altogether
the
rapidest
school
of
education
he
had
yet
found
the
stride
in
knowledge
seemed
gigantic
one
began
at
last
to
see
that
a
great
many
impressions
were
needed
to
make
very
little
education
but
how
many
could
be
crowded
into
one
day
without
making
any
education
at
all
became
the
pons
asinorum
of
tourist
mathematics
how
many
would
turn
out
to
be
wrong
whether
any
could
turn
out
right
was
ultimate
wisdom
the
ocean
the
persia
captain
judkins
and
james
the
most
distinguished
passenger
vanished
one
sunday
morning
in
a
furious
gale
in
the
mersey
to
make
place
for
the
drearier
picture
of
a
liverpool
street
as
seen
from
the
adelphi
in
november
murk
followed
instantly
by
the
passionate
delights
of
chester
and
the
romance
of
architecture
millions
of
americans
have
felt
this
succession
of
emotions
possibly
very
young
and
ingenuous
tourists
feel
them
still
but
in
days
before
tourists
when
the
romance
was
a
reality
not
a
picture
they
were
overwhelming
when
the
boys
went
out
to
eaton
hall
they
were
awed
as
thackeray
or
dickens
would
have
felt
in
the
presence
of
a
duke
the
very
name
of
grosvenor
struck
a
note
of
grandeur
the
long
suite
of
lofty
gilded
rooms
with
their
gilded
furniture
the
portraits
the
terraces
the
gardens
the
landscape
the
sense
of
superiority
in
the
england
of
the
fifties
actually
set
the
rich
nobleman
apart
above
americans
and
shopkeepers
aristocracy
was
real
so
was
the
england
of
dickens
oliver
twist
and
little
nell
lurked
in
every
churchyard
shadow
not
as
shadow
but
alive
even
charles
the
first
was
not
very
shadowy
standing
on
the
tower
to
see
his
army
defeated
nothing
thereabouts
had
very
much
changed
since
he
lost
his
battle
and
his
head
an
american
boy
fresh
from
boston
naturally
took
it
all
for
education
and
was
amused
at
this
sort
of
lesson
at
least
he
thought
he
felt
it
then
came
the
journey
up
to
london
through
birmingham
and
the
black
district
another
lesson
which
needed
much
more
to
be
rightly
felt
the
plunge
into
darkness
lurid
with
flames
the
sense
of
unknown
horror
in
this
weird
gloom
which
then
existed
nowhere
else
and
never
had
existed
before
except
in
volcanic
craters
the
violent
contrast
between
this
dense
smoky
impenetrable
darkness
and
the
soft
green
charm
that
one
glided
into
as
one
emerged
the
revelation
of
an
unknown
society
of
the
pit
made
a
boy
uncomfortable
though
he
had
no
idea
that
karl
marx
was
standing
there
waiting
for
him
and
that
sooner
or
later
the
process
of
education
would
have
to
deal
with
karl
marx
much
more
than
with
professor
bowen
of
harvard
college
or
his
satanic
majesty
john
stuart
mill
the
black
district
was
a
practical
education
but
it
was
infinitely
far
in
the
distance
the
boy
ran
away
from
it
as
he
ran
away
from
everything
he
disliked
had
he
known
enough
to
know
where
to
begin
he
would
have
seen
something
to
study
more
vital
than
the
civil
law
in
the
long
muddy
dirty
sordid
dreariness
of
oxford
street
as
his
dingy
dragged
its
weary
way
to
charing
cross
he
did
notice
one
peculiarity
about
it
worth
remembering
london
was
still
london
a
certain
style
dignified
its
grime
heavy
clumsy
arrogant
but
not
cheap
insular
but
large
barely
tolerant
of
an
outside
world
and
absolutely
the
boys
in
the
streets
made
such
free
comments
on
the
american
clothes
and
figures
that
the
travellers
hurried
to
put
on
tall
hats
and
long
overcoats
to
escape
criticism
no
stranger
had
rights
even
in
the
strand
the
eighteenth
century
held
its
own
history
muttered
down
fleet
street
like
johnson
in
adams
ear
vanity
fair
was
alive
on
piccadilly
in
yellow
chariots
with
coachmen
in
wigs
on
footmen
with
canes
on
the
footboard
and
a
shrivelled
old
woman
inside
half
the
great
houses
black
with
london
smoke
bore
large
funereal
hatchments
every
one
seemed
insolent
and
the
most
insolent
structures
in
the
world
were
the
royal
exchange
and
the
bank
of
england
in
november
london
was
still
vast
but
it
was
the
london
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
an
american
felt
and
hated
education
went
backward
adams
still
a
boy
could
not
guess
how
intensely
intimate
this
london
grime
was
to
become
to
him
as
a
man
but
he
could
still
less
conceive
himself
returning
to
it
fifty
years
afterwards
noting
at
each
turn
how
the
great
city
grew
smaller
as
it
doubled
in
size
cheaper
as
it
quadrupled
its
wealth
less
imperial
as
its
empire
widened
less
dignified
as
it
tried
to
be
civil
he
liked
it
best
when
he
hated
it
education
began
at
the
end
or
perhaps
would
end
at
the
beginning
thus
far
it
had
remained
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
next
step
took
it
back
to
the
sixteenth
he
crossed
to
antwerp
as
the
baron
osy
steamed
up
the
scheldt
in
the
morning
mists
a
travelling
band
on
deck
began
to
play
and
groups
of
peasants
working
along
the
fields
dropped
their
tools
to
join
in
dancing
ostade
and
teniers
were
as
much
alive
as
they
ever
were
and
even
the
duke
of
alva
was
still
at
home
the
cathedral
towered
above
a
mass
of
tiled
roofs
ending
abruptly
in
walls
and
a
landscape
that
had
not
changed
the
taste
of
the
town
was
thick
rich
ripe
like
a
sweet
wine
it
was
mediaeval
so
that
rubens
seemed
modern
it
was
one
of
the
strongest
and
fullest
flavors
that
ever
touched
the
young
man
palate
but
he
might
as
well
have
drunk
out
his
excitement
in
old
malmsey
for
all
the
education
he
got
from
it
even
in
art
one
can
hardly
begin
with
antwerp
cathedral
and
the
descent
from
the
cross
he
merely
got
drunk
on
his
emotions
and
had
then
to
get
sober
as
he
best
could
he
was
terribly
sober
when
he
saw
antwerp
half
a
century
afterwards
one
lesson
he
did
learn
without
suspecting
that
he
must
immediately
lose
it
he
felt
his
middle
ages
and
the
sixteenth
century
alive
he
was
young
enough
and
the
towns
were
dirty
enough
unimproved
unrestored
untouristed
to
retain
the
sense
of
reality
as
a
taste
or
a
smell
it
was
education
especially
because
it
lasted
barely
ten
years
longer
but
it
was
education
only
sensual
he
never
dreamed
of
trying
to
educate
himself
to
the
descent
from
the
cross
he
was
only
too
happy
to
feel
himself
kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
he
learned
only
to
loathe
the
sordid
necessity
of
getting
up
again
and
going
about
his
stupid
business
this
was
one
of
the
foreseen
dangers
of
europe
but
it
vanished
rapidly
enough
to
reassure
the
most
anxious
of
parents
dropped
into
berlin
one
morning
without
guide
or
direction
the
young
man
in
search
of
education
floundered
in
a
mere
mess
of
misunderstandings
he
could
never
recall
what
he
expected
to
find
but
whatever
he
expected
it
had
no
relation
with
what
it
turned
out
to
be
a
student
at
twenty
takes
easily
to
anything
even
to
berlin
and
he
would
have
accepted
the
thirteenth
century
pure
and
simple
since
his
guides
assured
him
that
this
was
his
right
path
but
a
week
experience
left
him
dazed
and
dull
faith
held
out
but
the
paths
grew
dim
berlin
astonished
him
but
he
had
no
lack
of
friends
to
show
him
all
the
amusement
it
had
to
offer
within
a
day
or
two
he
was
running
about
with
the
rest
to
and
and
smoking
bad
tobacco
drinking
poor
beer
and
eating
sauerkraut
and
sausages
as
though
he
knew
no
better
this
was
easy
one
can
always
descend
the
social
ladder
the
trouble
came
when
he
asked
for
the
education
he
was
promised
his
friends
took
him
to
be
registered
as
a
student
of
the
university
they
selected
his
professors
and
courses
they
showed
him
where
to
buy
the
institutes
of
gaius
and
several
german
works
on
the
civil
law
in
numerous
volumes
and
they
led
him
to
his
first
lecture
his
first
lecture
was
his
last
the
young
man
was
not
very
quick
and
he
had
almost
religious
respect
for
his
guides
and
advisers
but
he
needed
no
more
than
one
hour
to
satisfy
him
that
he
had
made
another
failure
in
education
and
this
time
a
fatal
one
that
the
language
would
require
at
least
three
months
hard
work
before
he
could
touch
the
law
was
an
annoying
discovery
but
the
shock
that
upset
him
was
the
discovery
of
the
university
itself
he
had
thought
harvard
college
a
torpid
school
but
it
was
instinct
with
life
compared
with
all
that
he
could
see
of
the
university
of
berlin
the
german
students
were
strange
animals
but
their
professors
were
beyond
pay
the
mental
attitude
of
the
university
was
not
of
an
american
world
what
sort
of
instruction
prevailed
in
other
branches
or
in
science
adams
had
no
occasion
to
ask
but
in
the
civil
law
he
found
only
the
lecture
system
in
its
deadliest
form
as
it
flourished
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
professor
mumbled
his
comments
the
students
made
or
seemed
to
make
notes
they
could
have
learned
from
books
or
discussion
in
a
day
more
than
they
could
learn
from
him
in
a
month
but
they
must
pay
his
fees
follow
his
course
and
be
his
scholars
if
they
wanted
a
degree
to
an
american
the
result
was
worthless
he
could
make
no
use
of
the
civil
law
without
some
previous
notion
of
the
common
law
but
the
student
who
knew
enough
of
the
common
law
to
understand
what
he
wanted
had
only
to
read
the
pandects
or
the
commentators
at
his
ease
in
america
and
be
his
own
professor
neither
the
method
nor
the
matter
nor
the
manner
could
profit
an
american
education
this
discovery
seemed
to
shock
none
of
the
students
they
went
to
the
lectures
made
notes
and
read
textbooks
but
never
pretended
to
take
their
professor
seriously
they
were
much
more
serious
in
reading
heine
they
knew
no
more
than
heine
what
good
they
were
getting
beyond
the
berlin
accent
which
was
bad
and
the
beer
which
was
not
to
compare
with
munich
and
the
dancing
which
was
better
at
vienna
they
enjoyed
the
beer
and
music
but
they
refused
to
be
responsible
for
the
education
anyway
as
they
defended
themselves
they
were
learning
the
language
so
the
young
man
fell
back
on
the
language
and
being
slow
at
languages
he
found
himself
falling
behind
all
his
friends
which
depressed
his
spirits
the
more
because
the
gloom
of
a
berlin
winter
and
of
berlin
architecture
seemed
to
him
a
particular
sort
of
gloom
never
attained
elsewhere
one
day
on
the
linden
he
caught
sight
of
charles
sumner
in
a
cab
and
ran
after
him
sumner
was
then
recovering
from
the
blows
of
the
south
carolinian
cane
or
club
and
he
was
pleased
to
find
a
young
worshipper
in
the
remote
prussian
wilderness
they
dined
together
and
went
to
hear
william
tell
at
the
opera
sumner
tried
to
encourage
his
friend
about
his
difficulties
of
language
i
came
to
berlin
or
rome
or
whatever
place
it
was
as
he
said
with
his
grand
air
of
mastery
i
came
to
berlin
unable
to
say
a
word
in
the
language
and
three
months
later
when
i
went
away
i
talked
it
to
my
cabman
adams
felt
himself
quite
unable
to
attain
in
so
short
a
time
such
social
advantages
and
one
day
complained
of
his
trials
to
robert
apthorp
of
boston
who
was
passing
the
winter
in
berlin
for
the
sake
of
its
music
apthorp
told
of
his
own
similar
struggle
and
how
he
had
entered
a
public
school
and
sat
for
months
with
reciting
their
lessons
and
catching
their
phrases
the
idea
suited
adams
desperate
frame
of
mind
at
least
it
ridded
him
of
the
university
and
the
civil
law
and
american
associations
in
apthorp
took
the
trouble
to
negotiate
with
the
of
the
gymnasium
for
permission
to
henry
adams
to
attend
the
school
as
a
member
of
the
a
class
of
boys
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
and
there
adams
went
for
three
months
as
though
he
had
not
always
avoided
high
schools
with
singular
antipathy
he
never
did
anything
else
so
foolish
but
he
was
given
a
bit
of
education
which
served
him
some
purpose
in
life
it
was
not
merely
the
language
though
three
months
passed
in
such
fashion
would
teach
a
poodle
enough
to
talk
with
a
cabman
and
this
was
all
that
foreign
students
could
expect
to
do
for
they
never
by
any
chance
would
come
in
contact
with
german
society
if
german
society
existed
about
which
they
knew
nothing
adams
never
learned
to
talk
german
well
but
the
same
might
be
said
of
his
english
if
he
could
believe
englishmen
he
learned
not
to
annoy
himself
on
this
account
his
difficulties
with
the
language
gradually
ceased
he
thought
himself
quite
germanized
in
he
even
deluded
himself
with
the
idea
that
he
read
it
as
though
it
were
english
which
proved
that
he
knew
little
about
it
but
whatever
success
he
had
in
his
own
experiment
interested
him
less
than
his
contact
with
german
education
he
had
revolted
at
the
american
school
and
university
he
had
instantly
rejected
the
german
university
and
as
his
last
experience
of
education
he
tried
the
german
high
school
the
experiment
was
hazardous
in
berlin
was
a
poor
provincial
town
simple
dirty
uncivilized
and
in
most
respects
disgusting
life
was
primitive
beyond
what
an
american
boy
could
have
imagined
overridden
by
military
methods
and
bureaucratic
pettiness
prussia
was
only
beginning
to
free
her
hands
from
internal
bonds
apart
from
discipline
activity
scarcely
existed
the
future
kaiser
wilhelm
i
regent
for
his
insane
brother
king
friedrich
wilhelm
iv
seemed
to
pass
his
time
looking
at
the
from
the
window
of
his
modest
palace
on
the
linden
german
manners
even
at
court
were
sometimes
brutal
and
german
thoroughness
at
school
was
apt
to
be
routine
bismarck
himself
was
then
struggling
to
begin
a
career
against
the
inertia
of
the
german
system
the
condition
of
germany
was
a
scandal
and
nuisance
to
every
earnest
german
all
whose
energies
were
turned
to
reforming
it
from
top
to
bottom
and
adams
walked
into
a
great
public
school
to
get
educated
at
precisely
the
time
when
the
germans
wanted
most
to
get
rid
of
the
education
they
were
forced
to
follow
as
an
episode
in
the
search
for
education
this
adventure
smacked
of
heine
the
school
system
has
doubtless
changed
and
at
all
events
the
schoolmasters
are
probably
long
ago
dead
the
story
has
no
longer
a
practical
value
and
had
very
little
even
at
the
time
one
could
at
least
say
in
defence
of
the
german
school
that
it
was
neither
very
brutal
nor
very
immoral
the
was
excellent
in
his
prussian
way
and
the
other
instructors
were
not
worse
than
in
other
schools
it
was
their
system
that
struck
the
systemless
american
with
horror
the
arbitrary
training
given
to
the
memory
was
stupefying
the
strain
that
the
memory
endured
was
a
form
of
torture
and
the
feats
that
the
boys
performed
without
complaint
were
pitiable
no
other
faculty
than
the
memory
seemed
to
be
recognized
least
of
all
was
any
use
made
of
reason
either
analytic
synthetic
or
dogmatic
the
german
government
did
not
encourage
reasoning
all
state
education
is
a
sort
of
dynamo
machine
for
polarizing
the
popular
mind
for
turning
and
holding
its
lines
of
force
in
the
direction
supposed
to
be
most
effective
for
state
purposes
the
german
machine
was
terribly
efficient
its
effect
on
the
children
was
pathetic
the
gymnasium
was
an
old
building
in
the
heart
of
berlin
which
served
the
educational
needs
of
the
small
tradesmen
or
bourgeoisie
of
the
neighborhood
the
children
were
if
ever
there
were
such
and
of
a
class
suspected
of
sympathy
and
concern
in
the
troubles
of
none
was
noble
or
connected
with
good
society
personally
they
were
rather
sympathetic
than
not
but
as
the
objects
of
education
they
were
proofs
of
nearly
all
the
evils
that
a
bad
system
could
give
apparently
adams
in
his
rigidly
illogical
pursuit
had
at
last
reached
his
ideal
of
a
viciously
logical
education
the
boys
physique
showed
it
first
but
their
physique
could
not
be
wholly
charged
to
the
school
german
food
was
bad
at
best
and
a
diet
of
sauerkraut
sausage
and
beer
could
never
be
good
but
it
was
not
the
food
alone
that
made
their
faces
white
and
their
flesh
flabby
they
never
breathed
fresh
air
they
had
never
heard
of
a
playground
in
all
berlin
not
a
cubic
inch
of
oxygen
was
admitted
in
winter
into
an
inhabited
building
in
the
school
every
room
was
tightly
closed
and
had
no
ventilation
the
air
was
foul
beyond
all
decency
but
when
the
american
opened
a
window
in
the
five
minutes
between
hours
he
violated
the
rules
and
was
invariably
rebuked
as
long
as
cold
weather
lasted
the
windows
were
shut
if
the
boys
had
a
holiday
they
were
apt
to
be
taken
on
long
tramps
in
the
thiergarten
or
elsewhere
always
ending
in
sausages
and
beer
with
this
they
were
required
to
prepare
daily
lessons
that
would
have
quickly
broken
down
strong
men
of
a
healthy
habit
and
which
they
could
learn
only
because
their
minds
were
morbid
the
german
university
had
seemed
a
failure
but
the
german
high
school
was
something
very
near
an
indictable
nuisance
before
the
month
of
april
arrived
the
experiment
of
german
education
had
reached
this
point
nothing
was
left
of
it
except
the
ghost
of
the
civil
law
shut
up
in
the
darkest
of
closets
never
to
gibber
again
before
any
one
who
could
repeat
the
story
the
derisive
jew
laughter
of
heine
ran
through
the
university
and
everything
else
in
berlin
of
course
when
one
is
twenty
years
old
life
is
bound
to
be
full
if
only
of
berlin
beer
although
german
student
life
was
on
the
whole
the
thinnest
of
beer
as
an
american
looked
on
it
but
though
nothing
except
small
fragments
remained
of
the
education
that
had
been
so
promising
or
promised
this
is
only
what
most
often
happens
in
life
when
turn
out
to
be
more
valuable
than
staples
the
german
university
and
german
law
were
failures
german
society
in
an
american
sense
did
not
exist
or
if
it
existed
never
showed
itself
to
an
american
the
german
theatre
on
the
other
hand
was
excellent
and
german
opera
with
the
ballet
was
almost
worth
a
journey
to
berlin
but
the
curious
and
perplexing
result
of
the
total
failure
of
german
education
was
that
the
student
only
clear
gain
his
single
step
to
a
higher
life
came
from
time
wasted
studies
neglected
vices
indulged
education
reversed
it
came
from
the
despised
and
and
it
was
accidental
unintended
unforeseen
when
his
companions
insisted
on
passing
two
or
three
afternoons
in
the
week
at
drinking
beer
smoking
german
tobacco
and
looking
at
fat
german
women
knitting
while
an
orchestra
played
dull
music
adams
went
with
them
for
the
sake
of
the
company
but
with
no
pretence
of
enjoyment
and
when
apthorp
gently
protested
that
he
exaggerated
his
indifference
for
of
course
he
enjoyed
beethoven
adams
replied
simply
that
he
loathed
beethoven
and
felt
a
slight
surprise
when
apthorp
and
the
others
laughed
as
though
they
thought
it
humor
he
saw
no
humor
in
it
he
supposed
that
except
musicians
every
one
thought
beethoven
a
bore
as
every
one
except
mathematicians
thought
mathematics
a
bore
sitting
thus
at
his
mentally
impassive
he
was
one
day
surprised
to
notice
that
his
mind
followed
the
movement
of
a
sinfonie
he
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
had
he
suddenly
read
a
new
language
among
the
marvels
of
education
this
was
the
most
marvellous
a
that
barred
his
senses
on
one
great
side
of
life
suddenly
fell
of
its
own
accord
without
so
much
as
his
knowing
when
it
happened
amid
the
fumes
of
coarse
tobacco
and
poor
beer
surrounded
by
the
commonest
of
german
a
new
sense
burst
out
like
a
flower
in
his
life
so
superior
to
the
old
senses
so
bewildering
so
astonished
at
its
own
existence
that
he
could
not
credit
it
and
watched
it
as
something
apart
accidental
and
not
to
be
trusted
he
slowly
came
to
admit
that
beethoven
had
partly
become
intelligible
to
him
but
he
was
the
more
inclined
to
think
that
beethoven
must
be
much
overrated
as
a
musician
to
be
so
easily
followed
this
could
not
be
called
education
for
he
had
never
so
much
as
listened
to
the
music
he
had
been
thinking
of
other
things
mere
mechanical
repetition
of
certain
sounds
had
stuck
to
his
unconscious
mind
beethoven
might
have
this
power
but
not
wagner
or
at
all
events
not
the
wagner
later
than
tannhauser
near
forty
years
passed
before
he
reached
the
gotterdammerung
one
might
talk
of
the
revival
of
an
atrophied
sense
the
mechanical
reaction
of
a
sleeping
consciousness
but
no
other
sense
awoke
his
sense
of
line
and
color
remained
as
dull
as
ever
and
as
far
as
ever
below
the
level
of
an
artist
his
metaphysical
sense
did
not
spring
into
life
so
that
his
mind
could
leap
the
bars
of
german
expression
into
sympathy
with
the
idealities
of
kant
and
hegel
although
he
insisted
that
his
faith
in
german
thought
and
literature
was
exalted
he
failed
to
approach
german
thought
and
he
shed
never
a
tear
of
emotion
over
the
pages
of
goethe
and
schiller
when
his
father
rashly
ventured
from
time
to
time
to
write
him
a
word
of
common
sense
the
young
man
would
listen
to
no
sense
at
all
but
insisted
that
berlin
was
the
best
of
educations
in
the
best
of
germanies
yet
when
at
last
april
came
and
some
genius
suggested
a
tramp
in
thuringen
his
heart
sang
like
a
bird
he
realized
what
a
nightmare
he
had
suffered
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
wherever
else
he
might
in
the
infinities
of
space
and
time
seek
for
education
it
should
not
be
again
in
berlin
chapter
vi
rome
the
tramp
in
thuringen
lasted
hours
by
the
end
of
the
first
walk
his
three
companions
john
bancroft
james
higginson
and
crowninshield
all
boston
and
harvard
college
like
himself
were
satisfied
with
what
they
had
seen
and
when
they
sat
down
to
rest
on
the
spot
where
goethe
had
written
warte
nur
balde
rubest
du
auch
the
profoundness
of
the
thought
and
the
wisdom
of
the
advice
affected
them
so
strongly
that
they
hired
a
wagon
and
drove
to
weimar
the
same
night
they
were
all
quite
happy
and
lighthearted
in
the
first
fresh
breath
of
leafless
spring
and
the
beer
was
better
than
at
berlin
but
they
were
all
equally
in
doubt
why
they
had
come
to
germany
and
not
one
of
them
could
say
why
they
stayed
adams
stayed
because
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
and
he
had
fears
that
his
father
patience
might
be
exhausted
if
he
asked
to
waste
time
elsewhere
they
could
not
think
that
their
education
required
a
return
to
berlin
a
few
days
at
dresden
in
the
spring
weather
satisfied
them
that
dresden
was
a
better
spot
for
general
education
than
berlin
and
equally
good
for
reading
civil
law
they
were
possibly
right
there
was
nothing
to
study
in
dresden
and
no
education
to
be
gained
but
the
sistine
madonna
and
the
correggios
were
famous
the
theatre
and
opera
were
sometimes
excellent
and
the
elbe
was
prettier
than
the
spree
they
could
always
fall
back
on
the
language
so
he
took
a
room
in
the
household
of
the
usual
small
government
clerk
with
the
usual
plain
daughters
and
continued
the
study
of
the
language
possibly
one
might
learn
something
more
by
accident
as
one
had
learned
something
of
beethoven
for
the
next
eighteen
months
the
young
man
pursued
accidental
education
since
he
could
pursue
no
other
and
by
great
good
fortune
europe
and
america
were
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
give
much
attention
to
his
accidental
education
had
every
chance
in
its
favor
especially
because
nothing
came
amiss
perhaps
the
chief
obstacle
to
the
youth
education
now
that
he
had
come
of
age
was
his
honesty
his
faith
in
his
intentions
even
after
berlin
had
become
a
nightmare
he
still
persuaded
himself
that
his
german
education
was
a
success
he
loved
or
thought
he
loved
the
people
but
the
germany
he
loved
was
the
which
the
germans
were
ashamed
of
and
were
destroying
as
fast
as
they
could
of
the
germany
to
come
he
knew
nothing
military
germany
was
his
abhorrence
what
he
liked
was
the
simple
character
the
sentiment
the
musical
and
metaphysical
abstraction
the
blundering
incapacity
of
the
german
for
practical
affairs
at
that
time
everyone
looked
on
germany
as
incapable
of
competing
with
france
england
or
america
in
any
sort
of
organized
energy
germany
had
no
confidence
in
herself
and
no
reason
to
feel
it
she
had
no
unity
and
no
reason
to
want
it
she
never
had
unity
her
religious
and
social
history
her
economical
interests
her
military
geography
her
political
convenience
had
always
tended
to
eccentric
rather
than
concentric
motion
until
and
railways
were
created
she
was
mediaeval
by
nature
and
geography
and
this
was
what
adams
under
the
teachings
of
carlyle
and
lowell
liked
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
do
himself
lasting
harm
floundering
between
worlds
passed
and
worlds
coming
which
had
a
habit
of
crushing
men
who
stayed
too
long
at
the
points
of
contact
suddenly
the
emperor
napoleon
declared
war
on
austria
and
raised
a
confused
point
of
morals
in
the
mind
of
europe
france
was
the
nightmare
of
germany
and
even
at
dresden
one
looked
on
the
return
of
napoleon
to
leipsic
as
the
most
likely
thing
in
the
world
one
morning
the
government
clerk
in
whose
family
adams
was
staying
rushed
into
his
room
to
consult
a
map
in
order
that
he
might
measure
the
distance
from
milan
to
dresden
the
third
napoleon
had
reached
lombardy
and
only
fifty
or
sixty
years
had
passed
since
the
first
napoleon
had
begun
his
military
successes
from
an
italian
base
an
enlightened
young
american
with
tastes
capped
by
fragments
of
a
german
education
and
the
most
excellent
intentions
had
to
make
up
his
mind
about
the
moral
value
of
these
conflicting
forces
france
was
the
wicked
spirit
of
moral
politics
and
whatever
helped
france
must
be
so
far
evil
at
that
time
austria
was
another
evil
spirit
italy
was
the
prize
they
disputed
and
for
at
least
fifteen
hundred
years
had
been
the
chief
object
of
their
greed
the
question
of
sympathy
had
disturbed
a
number
of
persons
during
that
period
the
question
of
morals
had
been
put
in
a
number
of
should
one
be
guelph
or
ghibelline
no
doubt
one
was
wiser
than
one
neighbors
who
had
found
no
way
of
settling
this
question
since
the
days
of
the
but
ignorance
did
better
to
discard
the
attempt
to
be
wise
for
wisdom
had
been
singularly
baffled
by
the
problem
better
take
sides
first
and
reason
about
it
for
the
rest
of
life
not
that
adams
felt
any
real
doubt
about
his
sympathies
or
wishes
he
had
not
been
german
long
enough
for
befogging
his
mind
to
that
point
but
the
moment
was
decisive
for
much
to
come
especially
for
political
morals
his
morals
were
the
highest
and
he
clung
to
them
to
preserve
his
but
steam
and
electricity
had
brought
about
new
political
and
social
concentrations
or
were
making
them
necessary
in
the
line
of
his
moral
principles
freedom
education
economic
development
and
so
forth
which
required
association
with
allies
as
doubtful
as
napoleon
iii
and
robberies
with
violence
on
a
very
extensive
scale
as
long
as
he
could
argue
that
his
opponents
were
wicked
he
could
join
in
robbing
and
killing
them
without
a
qualm
but
it
might
happen
that
the
good
were
robbed
education
insisted
on
finding
a
moral
foundation
for
robbery
he
could
hope
to
begin
life
in
the
character
of
no
animal
more
moral
than
a
monkey
unless
he
could
satisfy
himself
when
and
why
robbery
and
murder
were
a
virtue
and
duty
education
founded
on
mere
was
merely
guelph
and
ghibelline
over
again
machiavelli
translated
into
american
luckily
for
him
he
had
a
sister
much
brighter
than
he
ever
was
though
he
thought
himself
a
rather
superior
person
who
after
marrying
charles
kuhn
of
philadelphia
had
come
to
italy
and
like
all
good
americans
and
english
was
hotly
italian
in
july
she
was
at
thun
in
switzerland
and
there
henry
adams
joined
them
women
have
commonly
a
very
positive
moral
sense
that
which
they
will
is
right
that
which
they
reject
is
wrong
and
their
will
in
most
cases
ends
by
settling
the
moral
kuhn
had
a
double
superiority
she
not
only
adored
italy
but
she
cordially
disliked
germany
in
all
its
varieties
she
saw
no
gain
in
helping
her
brother
to
be
germanized
and
she
wanted
him
much
to
be
civilized
she
was
the
first
young
woman
he
was
ever
intimate
with
quick
sensitive
wilful
or
full
of
will
energetic
sympathetic
and
intelligent
enough
to
supply
a
score
of
men
with
ideas
and
he
was
delighted
to
give
her
the
reins
to
let
her
drive
him
where
she
would
it
was
his
first
experiment
in
giving
the
reins
to
a
woman
and
he
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
results
that
he
never
wanted
to
take
them
back
in
after
life
he
made
a
general
law
of
experience
no
woman
had
ever
driven
him
wrong
no
man
had
ever
driven
him
right
nothing
would
satisfy
kuhn
but
to
go
to
the
seat
of
war
as
soon
as
the
armistice
was
declared
wild
as
the
idea
seemed
nothing
was
easier
the
party
crossed
the
gothard
and
reached
milan
picturesque
with
every
sort
of
uniform
and
every
sign
of
war
to
young
adams
this
first
plunge
into
italy
passed
beethoven
as
a
piece
of
accidental
education
like
music
it
differed
from
other
education
in
being
not
a
means
of
pursuing
life
but
one
of
the
ends
attained
further
on
these
lines
one
could
not
go
it
had
but
one
defect
that
of
attainment
life
had
no
richer
impression
to
give
it
offers
barely
such
and
the
intervals
seem
long
exactly
what
they
teach
would
puzzle
a
berlin
jurist
yet
they
seem
to
have
an
economic
value
since
most
people
would
decline
to
part
with
even
their
faded
memories
except
at
a
valuation
ridiculously
extravagant
they
were
also
what
men
pay
most
for
but
one
ideas
become
hopelessly
mixed
in
trying
to
reduce
such
forms
of
education
to
a
standard
of
exchangeable
value
and
as
in
political
economy
one
had
best
disregard
altogether
what
can
not
be
stated
in
equivalents
the
proper
equivalent
of
pleasure
is
pain
which
is
also
a
form
of
education
not
satisfied
with
milan
kuhn
insisted
on
invading
the
enemy
country
and
the
carriage
was
chartered
for
innsbruck
by
way
of
the
stelvio
pass
the
valtellina
as
the
carriage
drove
up
it
showed
war
garibaldi
cacciatori
were
the
only
visible
inhabitants
no
one
could
say
whether
the
pass
was
open
but
in
any
case
no
carriage
had
yet
crossed
at
the
inns
the
handsome
young
officers
in
command
of
the
detachments
were
delighted
to
accept
invitations
to
dinner
and
to
talk
all
the
evening
of
their
battles
to
the
charming
patriot
who
sparkled
with
interest
and
flattery
but
not
one
of
them
knew
whether
their
enemies
the
abhorred
austrian
jagers
would
let
the
travellers
through
their
lines
as
a
rule
gaiety
was
not
the
character
failing
in
any
party
that
kuhn
belonged
to
but
when
at
last
after
climbing
what
was
said
to
be
the
finest
in
europe
the
carriage
turned
the
last
shoulder
where
the
glacier
of
the
ortler
spitze
tumbled
its
huge
mass
down
upon
the
road
even
kuhn
gasped
when
she
was
driven
directly
up
to
the
barricade
and
stopped
by
the
double
line
of
sentries
stretching
on
either
side
up
the
mountains
till
the
flash
of
the
gun
barrels
was
lost
in
the
flash
of
the
snow
for
accidental
education
the
picture
had
its
value
the
earliest
of
these
pictures
count
for
most
as
first
impressions
must
and
adams
never
afterwards
cared
much
for
landscape
education
except
perhaps
in
the
tropics
for
the
sake
of
the
contrast
as
education
that
chapter
too
was
read
and
set
aside
the
handsome
blond
officers
of
the
jagers
were
not
to
be
beaten
in
courtesy
by
the
handsome
young
officers
of
the
cacciatori
the
eternal
woman
as
usual
when
she
is
young
pretty
and
engaging
had
her
way
and
the
barricade
offered
no
resistance
in
fifteen
minutes
the
carriage
was
rolling
down
to
mals
swarming
with
german
soldiers
and
german
fleas
worse
than
the
italian
and
german
language
thought
and
atmosphere
of
which
young
adams
thanks
to
his
glimpse
of
italy
never
again
felt
quite
the
old
confident
charm
yet
he
could
talk
to
his
cabman
and
conscientiously
did
his
cathedrals
his
rhine
and
whatever
his
companions
suggested
faithful
to
his
scheme
of
passing
two
winters
in
study
of
the
civil
law
he
went
back
to
dresden
with
a
letter
to
the
frau
hofrathin
von
reichenbach
in
whose
house
lowell
and
other
americans
had
pursued
studies
more
or
less
serious
in
those
days
the
initials
was
a
new
book
the
charm
which
its
clever
author
had
laboriously
woven
over
munich
gave
also
a
certain
reflected
light
to
dresden
young
adams
had
nothing
to
do
but
take
visit
the
galleries
and
go
to
the
theatre
but
his
social
failure
in
the
line
of
the
initials
was
humiliating
and
he
succumbed
to
it
the
frau
hofrathin
herself
was
sometimes
roused
to
huge
laughter
at
the
total
discomfiture
and
helplessness
of
the
young
american
in
the
face
of
her
society
possibly
an
education
may
be
the
wider
and
the
richer
for
a
large
experience
of
the
world
raphael
pumpelly
and
clarence
king
at
about
the
same
time
were
enriching
their
education
by
a
picturesque
intimacy
with
the
manners
of
the
apaches
and
digger
indians
all
experience
is
an
arch
to
build
upon
yet
adams
admitted
himself
unable
to
guess
what
use
his
second
winter
in
germany
was
to
him
or
what
he
expected
it
to
be
even
the
doctrine
of
accidental
education
broke
down
there
were
no
accidents
in
dresden
as
soon
as
the
winter
was
over
he
closed
and
locked
the
german
door
with
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
took
the
road
to
italy
he
had
then
pursued
his
education
as
it
pleased
him
for
eighteen
months
and
in
spite
of
the
infinite
variety
of
new
impressions
which
had
packed
themselves
into
his
mind
he
knew
no
more
for
his
practical
purposes
than
the
day
he
graduated
he
had
made
no
step
towards
a
profession
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
schoolboy
of
society
he
was
unfit
for
any
career
in
europe
and
unfitted
for
any
career
in
america
and
he
had
not
natural
intelligence
enough
to
see
what
a
mess
he
had
thus
far
made
of
his
education
by
twisting
life
to
follow
accidental
and
devious
paths
one
might
perhaps
find
some
use
for
accidental
and
devious
knowledge
but
this
had
been
no
part
of
henry
adams
plan
when
he
chose
the
path
most
admired
by
the
best
judges
and
followed
it
till
he
found
it
led
nowhere
nothing
had
been
further
from
his
mind
when
he
started
in
november
than
to
become
a
tourist
but
a
mere
tourist
and
nothing
else
he
had
become
in
april
when
he
joined
his
sister
in
florence
his
father
had
been
in
the
right
the
young
man
felt
a
little
sore
about
it
supposing
his
father
asked
him
on
his
return
what
equivalent
he
had
brought
back
for
the
time
and
money
put
into
his
experiment
the
only
possible
answer
would
be
sir
i
am
a
tourist
the
answer
was
not
what
he
had
meant
it
to
be
and
he
was
not
likely
to
better
it
by
asking
his
father
in
turn
what
equivalent
his
brothers
or
cousins
or
friends
at
home
had
got
out
of
the
same
time
and
money
spent
in
boston
all
they
had
put
into
the
law
was
certainly
thrown
away
but
were
they
happier
in
science
in
theory
one
might
say
with
some
show
of
proof
that
a
pure
scientific
education
was
alone
correct
yet
many
of
his
friends
who
took
it
found
reason
to
complain
that
it
was
anything
but
a
pure
scientific
world
in
which
they
lived
meanwhile
his
father
had
quite
enough
perplexities
of
his
own
without
seeking
more
in
his
son
errors
his
quincy
district
had
sent
him
to
congress
and
in
the
spring
of
he
was
in
the
full
confusion
of
nominating
candidates
for
the
presidential
election
in
november
he
supported
seward
the
republican
party
was
an
unknown
force
and
the
democratic
party
was
torn
to
pieces
no
one
could
see
far
into
the
future
fathers
could
blunder
as
well
as
sons
and
in
every
one
was
conscious
of
being
dragged
along
paths
much
less
secure
than
those
of
the
european
tourist
for
the
time
the
young
man
was
safe
from
interference
and
went
on
his
way
with
a
light
heart
to
take
whatever
chance
fragments
of
education
god
or
the
devil
was
pleased
to
give
him
for
he
knew
no
longer
the
good
from
the
bad
he
had
of
both
sorts
more
than
he
knew
how
to
use
perhaps
the
most
useful
purpose
he
set
himself
to
serve
was
that
of
his
pen
for
he
wrote
long
letters
during
the
next
three
months
to
his
brother
charles
which
his
brother
caused
to
be
printed
in
the
boston
courier
and
the
exercise
was
good
for
him
he
had
little
to
say
and
said
it
not
very
well
but
that
mattered
less
the
habit
of
expression
leads
to
the
search
for
something
to
express
something
remains
as
a
residuum
of
the
commonplace
itself
if
one
strikes
out
every
commonplace
in
the
expression
young
men
as
a
rule
saw
little
in
italy
or
anywhere
else
and
in
after
life
when
adams
began
to
learn
what
some
men
could
see
he
shrank
into
corners
of
shame
at
the
thought
that
he
should
have
betrayed
his
own
inferiority
as
though
it
were
his
pride
while
he
invited
his
neighbors
to
measure
and
admire
but
it
was
still
the
nearest
approach
he
had
yet
made
to
an
intelligent
act
for
the
rest
italy
was
mostly
an
emotion
and
the
emotion
naturally
centred
in
rome
the
american
parent
curiously
enough
while
bitterly
hostile
to
paris
seemed
rather
disposed
to
accept
rome
as
legitimate
education
though
abused
but
to
young
men
seeking
education
in
a
serious
spirit
taking
for
granted
that
everything
had
a
cause
and
that
nature
tended
to
an
end
rome
was
altogether
the
most
violent
vice
in
the
world
and
rome
before
was
seductive
beyond
resistance
the
month
of
may
was
divine
no
doubt
other
young
men
and
occasionally
young
women
have
passed
the
month
of
may
in
rome
since
then
and
conceive
that
the
charm
continues
to
exist
possibly
it
does
in
them
but
in
the
lights
and
shadows
were
still
mediaeval
and
mediaeval
rome
was
alive
the
shadows
breathed
and
glowed
full
of
soft
forms
felt
by
lost
senses
no
of
science
had
yet
skinned
off
the
epidermis
of
history
thought
and
feeling
the
pictures
were
uncleaned
the
churches
unrestored
the
ruins
unexcavated
mediaeval
rome
was
sorcery
rome
was
the
worst
spot
on
earth
to
teach
youth
what
to
do
with
a
world
one
emotions
in
rome
were
one
private
affair
like
one
glass
of
absinthe
before
dinner
in
the
palais
royal
they
must
be
hurtful
else
they
could
not
have
been
so
intense
and
they
were
surely
immoral
for
no
one
priest
or
politician
could
honestly
read
in
the
ruins
of
rome
any
other
certain
lesson
than
that
they
were
evidence
of
the
just
judgments
of
an
outraged
god
against
all
the
doings
of
man
this
moral
unfitted
young
men
for
every
sort
of
useful
activity
it
made
rome
a
gospel
of
anarchy
and
vice
the
last
place
under
the
sun
for
educating
the
young
yet
it
was
by
common
consent
the
only
spot
that
the
young
of
either
sex
and
every
race
passionately
perversely
wickedly
loved
boys
never
see
a
conclusion
only
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
can
man
conclude
anything
but
the
first
impulse
given
to
the
boy
is
apt
to
lead
or
drive
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
into
conclusion
after
conclusion
that
he
never
dreamed
of
reaching
one
looked
idly
enough
at
the
forum
or
at
peter
but
one
never
forgot
the
look
and
it
never
ceased
reacting
to
a
young
bostonian
fresh
from
germany
rome
seemed
a
pure
emotion
quite
free
from
economic
or
actual
values
and
he
could
not
in
reason
or
common
sense
foresee
that
it
was
mechanically
piling
up
conundrum
after
conundrum
in
his
educational
path
which
seemed
unconnected
but
that
he
had
got
to
connect
that
seemed
insoluble
but
had
got
to
be
somehow
solved
rome
was
not
a
beetle
to
be
dissected
and
dropped
not
a
bad
french
novel
to
be
read
in
a
railway
train
and
thrown
out
of
the
window
after
other
bad
french
novels
the
morals
of
which
could
never
approach
the
immorality
of
roman
history
rome
was
actual
it
was
england
it
was
going
to
be
america
rome
could
not
be
fitted
into
an
orderly
bostonian
systematic
scheme
of
evolution
no
law
of
progress
applied
to
it
not
even
the
last
refuge
of
helpless
historians
had
value
for
it
the
forum
no
more
led
to
the
vatican
than
the
vatican
to
the
forum
rienzi
garibaldi
tiberius
gracchus
aurelian
might
be
mixed
up
in
any
relation
of
time
along
with
a
thousand
more
and
never
lead
to
a
sequence
the
great
word
evolution
had
not
yet
in
made
a
new
religion
of
history
but
the
old
religion
had
preached
the
same
doctrine
for
a
thousand
years
without
finding
in
the
entire
history
of
rome
anything
but
flat
contradiction
of
course
both
priests
and
evolutionists
bitterly
denied
this
heresy
but
what
they
affirmed
or
denied
in
had
very
little
importance
indeed
for
anarchy
lost
no
ground
meanwhile
the
problem
became
only
the
more
fascinating
probably
it
was
more
vital
in
may
than
it
had
been
in
october
when
the
idea
of
writing
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
city
first
started
to
the
mind
of
gibbon
in
the
close
of
the
evening
as
i
sat
musing
in
the
church
of
the
zoccolanti
or
franciscan
friars
while
they
were
singing
vespers
in
the
temple
of
jupiter
on
the
ruins
of
the
capitol
murray
handbook
had
the
grace
to
quote
this
passage
from
gibbon
autobiography
which
led
adams
more
than
once
to
sit
at
sunset
on
the
steps
of
the
church
of
santa
maria
di
ara
coeli
curiously
wondering
that
not
an
inch
had
been
gained
by
gibbon
or
all
the
historians
since
towards
explaining
the
fall
the
mystery
remained
unsolved
the
charm
remained
intact
two
great
experiments
of
western
civilization
had
left
there
the
chief
monuments
of
their
failure
and
nothing
proved
that
the
city
might
not
still
survive
to
express
the
failure
of
a
third
the
young
man
had
no
idea
what
he
was
doing
the
thought
of
posing
for
a
gibbon
never
entered
his
mind
he
was
a
tourist
even
to
the
depths
of
his
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
should
be
nothing
else
for
even
the
greatest
of
men
can
not
sit
with
dignity
in
the
close
of
evening
among
the
ruins
of
the
capitol
unless
they
have
something
quite
original
to
say
about
it
tacitus
could
do
it
so
could
michael
angelo
and
so
at
a
pinch
could
gibbon
though
in
figure
hardly
heroic
but
in
sum
none
of
them
could
say
very
much
more
than
the
tourist
who
went
on
repeating
to
himself
the
eternal
question
why
why
why
as
his
neighbor
the
blind
beggar
might
do
sitting
next
him
on
the
church
steps
no
one
ever
had
answered
the
question
to
the
satisfaction
of
any
one
else
yet
every
one
who
had
either
head
or
heart
felt
that
sooner
or
later
he
must
make
up
his
mind
what
answer
to
accept
substitute
the
word
america
for
the
word
rome
and
the
question
became
personal
perhaps
henry
learned
something
in
rome
though
he
never
knew
it
and
never
sought
it
rome
dwarfs
teachers
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
scarcely
bore
the
test
of
posing
with
rome
for
a
background
perhaps
garibaldi
possibly
even
cavour
could
have
sat
in
the
close
of
the
evening
among
the
ruins
of
the
capitol
but
one
hardly
saw
napoleon
iii
there
or
palmerston
or
tennyson
or
longfellow
one
morning
adams
happened
to
be
chatting
in
the
studio
of
hamilton
wilde
when
a
englishman
came
in
evidently
excited
and
told
of
the
shock
he
had
just
received
when
riding
near
the
circus
maximus
at
coming
unexpectedly
on
the
guillotine
where
some
criminal
had
been
put
to
death
an
hour
or
two
before
the
sudden
surprise
had
quite
overcome
him
and
adams
who
seldom
saw
the
point
of
a
story
till
time
had
blunted
it
listened
sympathetically
to
learn
what
new
form
of
grim
horror
had
for
the
moment
wiped
out
the
memory
of
two
thousand
years
of
roman
bloodshed
or
the
consolation
derived
from
history
and
statistics
that
most
citizens
of
rome
seemed
to
be
the
better
for
guillotining
only
by
slow
degrees
he
grappled
the
conviction
that
the
victim
of
the
shock
was
robert
browning
and
on
the
background
of
the
circus
maximus
the
christian
martyrs
flaming
as
torches
and
the
morning
murderer
on
the
block
browning
seemed
rather
in
place
as
a
gentlemanly
english
pippa
passes
while
afterwards
in
the
light
of
belgravia
he
never
made
part
of
his
background
except
by
effacement
browning
might
have
sat
with
gibbon
among
the
ruins
and
few
romans
would
have
smiled
yet
browning
never
revealed
the
poetic
depths
of
saint
francis
william
story
could
not
touch
the
secret
of
michael
angelo
and
mommsen
hardly
said
all
that
one
felt
by
instinct
in
the
lives
of
cicero
and
caesar
they
taught
what
as
a
rule
needed
no
teaching
the
lessons
of
a
rather
cheap
imagination
and
cheaper
politics
rome
was
a
bewildering
complex
of
ideas
experiments
ambitions
energies
without
her
the
western
world
was
pointless
and
fragmentary
she
gave
heart
and
unity
to
it
all
yet
gibbon
might
have
gone
on
for
the
whole
century
sitting
among
the
ruins
of
the
capitol
and
no
one
would
have
passed
capable
of
telling
him
what
it
meant
perhaps
it
meant
nothing
so
it
ended
the
happiest
month
of
may
that
life
had
yet
offered
fading
behind
the
present
and
probably
beyond
the
past
somewhere
into
abstract
time
grotesquely
out
of
place
with
the
berlin
scheme
or
a
boston
future
adams
explained
to
himself
that
he
was
absorbing
knowledge
he
would
have
put
it
better
had
he
said
that
knowledge
was
absorbing
him
he
was
passive
in
spite
of
swarming
impressions
he
knew
no
more
when
he
left
rome
than
he
did
when
he
entered
it
as
a
marketable
object
his
value
was
less
his
next
step
went
far
to
convince
him
that
accidental
education
whatever
its
economical
return
might
be
was
prodigiously
successful
as
an
object
in
itself
everything
conspired
to
ruin
his
sound
scheme
of
life
and
to
make
him
a
vagrant
as
well
as
pauper
he
went
on
to
naples
and
there
in
the
hot
june
heard
rumors
that
garibaldi
and
his
thousand
were
about
to
attack
palermo
calling
on
the
american
minister
chandler
of
pennsylvania
he
was
kindly
treated
not
for
his
merit
but
for
his
name
and
chandler
amiably
consented
to
send
him
to
the
seat
of
war
as
bearer
of
despatches
to
captain
palmer
of
the
american
sloop
of
war
iroquois
young
adams
seized
the
chance
and
went
to
palermo
in
a
government
transport
filled
with
fleas
commanded
by
a
charming
prince
caracciolo
he
told
all
about
it
to
the
boston
courier
where
the
narrative
probably
exists
to
this
day
unless
the
files
of
the
courier
have
wholly
perished
but
of
its
bearing
on
education
the
courier
did
not
speak
he
himself
would
have
much
liked
to
know
whether
it
had
any
bearing
whatever
and
what
was
its
value
as
a
course
quite
apart
from
its
value
as
life
attained
realized
capitalized
it
had
also
a
certain
value
as
a
lesson
in
something
though
adams
could
never
classify
the
branch
of
study
loosely
the
tourist
called
it
knowledge
of
men
but
it
was
just
the
reverse
it
was
knowledge
of
one
ignorance
of
men
captain
palmer
of
the
iroquois
who
was
a
friend
of
the
young
man
uncle
sydney
brooks
took
him
with
the
officers
of
the
ship
to
make
an
evening
call
on
garibaldi
whom
they
found
in
the
senate
house
towards
sunset
at
supper
with
his
picturesque
and
piratic
staff
in
the
full
noise
and
color
of
the
palermo
revolution
as
a
spectacle
it
belonged
to
rossini
and
the
italian
opera
or
to
alexandre
dumas
at
the
least
but
the
spectacle
was
not
its
educational
side
garibaldi
left
the
table
and
sitting
down
at
the
window
had
a
few
words
of
talk
with
captain
palmer
and
young
adams
at
that
moment
in
the
summer
of
garibaldi
was
certainly
the
most
serious
of
the
doubtful
energies
in
the
world
the
most
essential
to
gauge
rightly
even
then
society
was
dividing
between
banker
and
anarchist
one
or
the
other
garibaldi
must
serve
himself
a
typical
anarchist
sure
to
overshadow
europe
and
alarm
empires
bigger
than
naples
his
success
depended
on
his
mind
his
energy
was
beyond
doubt
adams
had
the
chance
to
look
this
sphinx
in
the
eyes
and
for
five
minutes
to
watch
him
like
a
wild
animal
at
the
moment
of
his
greatest
achievement
and
most
splendid
action
one
saw
a
man
in
a
red
flannel
shirt
absolutely
impervious
a
type
of
which
adams
knew
nothing
sympathetic
it
was
and
one
felt
that
it
was
simple
one
suspected
even
that
it
might
be
childlike
but
could
form
no
guess
of
its
intelligence
in
his
own
eyes
garibaldi
might
be
a
napoleon
or
a
spartacus
in
the
hands
of
cavour
he
might
become
a
condottiere
in
the
eyes
of
history
he
might
like
the
rest
of
the
world
be
only
the
vigorous
player
in
the
game
he
did
not
understand
the
student
was
none
the
wiser
this
compound
nature
of
patriot
and
pirate
had
illumined
italian
history
from
the
beginning
and
was
no
more
intelligible
to
itself
than
to
a
young
american
who
had
no
experience
in
double
natures
in
the
end
if
the
autobiography
tells
truth
garibaldi
saw
and
said
that
he
had
not
understood
his
own
acts
that
he
had
been
an
instrument
that
he
had
served
the
purposes
of
the
class
he
least
wanted
to
help
yet
in
he
thought
himself
the
revolution
anarchic
napoleonic
and
his
ambition
was
unbounded
what
should
a
young
bostonian
have
made
of
a
character
like
this
internally
alive
with
childlike
fancies
and
externally
quiet
simple
almost
innocent
uttering
with
apparent
conviction
the
usual
commonplaces
of
popular
politics
that
all
politicians
use
as
the
small
change
of
their
intercourse
with
the
public
but
never
betraying
a
thought
precisely
this
class
of
mind
was
to
be
the
toughest
problem
of
adams
practical
life
but
he
could
never
make
anything
of
it
the
lesson
of
garibaldi
as
education
seemed
to
teach
the
extreme
complexity
of
extreme
simplicity
but
one
could
have
learned
this
from
a
one
did
not
need
the
vivid
recollection
of
the
seafaring
captain
of
genoese
adventurers
and
sicilian
brigands
supping
in
the
july
heat
and
sicilian
dirt
and
revolutionary
clamor
among
the
barricaded
streets
of
insurgent
palermo
merely
in
order
to
remember
that
simplicity
is
complex
adams
left
the
problem
as
he
found
it
and
came
north
to
stumble
over
others
less
picturesque
but
nearer
he
squandered
two
or
three
months
on
paris
from
the
first
he
had
avoided
paris
and
had
wanted
no
french
influence
in
his
education
he
disapproved
of
france
in
the
lump
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
language
one
must
have
enough
to
order
dinner
and
buy
a
theatre
ticket
but
more
he
did
not
seek
he
disliked
the
empire
and
the
emperor
particularly
but
this
was
a
trifle
he
disliked
most
the
french
mind
to
save
himself
the
trouble
of
drawing
up
a
long
list
of
all
that
he
disliked
he
disapproved
of
the
whole
once
for
all
and
shut
them
figuratively
out
of
his
life
france
was
not
serious
and
he
was
not
serious
in
going
there
he
did
this
in
good
faith
obeying
the
lessons
his
teachers
had
taught
him
but
the
curious
result
followed
that
being
in
no
way
responsible
for
the
french
and
sincerely
disapproving
them
he
felt
quite
at
liberty
to
enjoy
to
the
full
everything
he
disapproved
stated
thus
crudely
the
idea
sounds
derisive
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
several
thousand
americans
passed
much
of
their
time
there
on
this
understanding
they
sought
to
take
share
in
every
function
that
was
open
to
approach
as
they
sought
tickets
to
the
opera
because
they
were
not
a
part
of
it
adams
did
like
the
rest
all
thought
of
serious
education
had
long
vanished
he
tried
to
acquire
a
few
french
idioms
without
even
aspiring
to
master
a
subjunctive
but
he
succeeded
better
in
acquiring
a
modest
taste
for
bordeaux
and
burgundy
and
one
or
two
sauces
for
the
trois
freres
provencaux
and
voisin
and
philippe
and
the
cafe
anglais
for
the
palais
royal
theatre
and
the
varietes
and
the
gymnase
for
the
brohans
and
bressant
rose
cheri
and
gil
perez
and
other
lights
of
the
stage
his
friends
were
good
to
him
life
was
amusing
paris
rapidly
became
familiar
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
he
forgot
even
to
disapprove
of
it
but
he
studied
nothing
entered
no
society
and
made
no
acquaintance
accidental
education
went
far
in
paris
and
one
picked
up
a
deal
of
knowledge
that
might
become
useful
perhaps
after
all
the
three
months
passed
there
might
serve
better
purpose
than
the
months
passed
elsewhere
but
he
did
not
intend
it
did
not
think
it
and
looked
at
it
as
a
momentary
and
frivolous
vacation
before
going
home
to
fit
himself
for
life
therewith
after
staying
as
long
as
he
could
and
spending
all
the
money
he
dared
he
started
with
mixed
emotions
but
no
education
for
home
chapter
vii
treason
when
forty
years
afterwards
henry
adams
looked
back
over
his
adventures
in
search
of
knowledge
he
asked
himself
whether
fortune
or
fate
had
ever
dealt
its
cards
quite
so
wildly
to
any
of
his
known
antecessors
as
when
it
led
him
to
begin
the
study
of
law
and
to
vote
for
abraham
lincoln
on
the
same
day
he
dropped
back
on
quincy
like
a
lump
of
lead
he
rebounded
like
a
football
tossed
into
space
by
an
unknown
energy
which
played
with
all
his
generation
as
a
cat
plays
with
mice
the
simile
is
none
too
strong
not
one
man
in
america
wanted
the
civil
war
or
expected
or
intended
it
a
small
minority
wanted
secession
the
vast
majority
wanted
to
go
on
with
their
occupations
in
peace
not
one
however
clever
or
learned
guessed
what
happened
possibly
a
few
southern
loyalists
in
despair
might
dream
it
as
an
impossible
chance
but
none
planned
it
as
for
henry
adams
fresh
from
europe
and
chaos
of
another
sort
he
plunged
at
once
into
a
lurid
atmosphere
of
politics
quite
heedless
of
any
education
or
forethought
his
past
melted
away
the
prodigal
was
welcomed
home
but
not
even
his
father
asked
a
malicious
question
about
the
pandects
at
the
utmost
he
hinted
at
some
shade
of
prodigality
by
quietly
inviting
his
son
to
act
as
private
secretary
during
the
winter
in
washington
as
though
any
young
man
who
could
afford
to
throw
away
two
winters
on
the
civil
law
could
afford
to
read
blackstone
for
another
winter
without
a
master
the
young
man
was
beyond
satire
and
asked
only
a
pretext
for
throwing
all
education
to
the
east
wind
november
at
best
is
sad
and
november
at
quincy
had
been
from
earliest
childhood
the
least
gay
of
seasons
nowhere
else
does
the
uncharitable
autumn
wreak
its
spite
so
harshly
on
the
frail
wreck
of
the
grasshopper
summer
yet
even
a
quincy
november
seemed
temperate
before
the
chill
of
a
boston
january
this
was
saying
much
for
the
november
of
at
quincy
stood
apart
from
other
memories
as
lurid
beyond
description
although
no
one
believed
in
civil
war
the
air
reeked
of
it
and
the
republicans
organized
their
clubs
and
parades
as
in
a
form
military
in
all
things
except
weapons
henry
reached
home
in
time
to
see
the
last
of
these
processions
stretching
in
ranks
of
torches
along
the
hillside
file
down
through
the
november
night
to
the
old
house
where
adams
their
member
of
congress
received
them
and
let
them
pretend
what
they
liked
their
air
was
not
that
of
innocence
profoundly
ignorant
anxious
and
curious
the
young
man
packed
his
modest
trunk
again
which
had
not
yet
time
to
be
unpacked
and
started
for
washington
with
his
family
ten
years
had
passed
since
his
last
visit
but
very
little
had
changed
as
in
and
so
in
the
same
rude
colony
was
camped
in
the
same
forest
with
the
same
unfinished
greek
temples
for
work
rooms
and
sloughs
for
roads
the
government
had
an
air
of
social
instability
and
incompleteness
that
went
far
to
support
the
right
of
secession
in
theory
as
in
fact
but
right
or
wrong
secession
was
likely
to
be
easy
where
there
was
so
little
to
secede
from
the
union
was
a
sentiment
but
not
much
more
and
in
december
the
sentiment
about
the
capitol
was
chiefly
hostile
so
far
as
it
made
itself
felt
john
adams
was
better
off
in
philadelphia
in
than
his
henry
in
in
washington
patriotism
ended
by
throwing
a
halo
over
the
continental
congress
but
over
the
close
of
the
congress
in
no
halo
could
be
thrown
by
any
one
who
saw
it
of
all
the
crowd
swarming
in
washington
that
winter
young
adams
was
surely
among
the
most
ignorant
and
helpless
but
he
saw
plainly
that
the
knowledge
possessed
by
everybody
about
him
was
hardly
greater
than
his
own
never
in
a
long
life
did
he
seek
to
master
a
lesson
so
obscure
sumner
was
given
to
saying
after
oxenstiern
quantula
sapientia
mundus
regitur
oxenstiern
talked
of
a
world
that
wanted
wisdom
but
adams
found
himself
seeking
education
in
a
world
that
seemed
to
him
both
unwise
and
ignorant
the
southern
secessionists
were
certainly
unbalanced
in
mind
fit
for
medical
treatment
like
other
victims
of
hallucination
haunted
by
suspicion
by
idees
fixes
by
violent
morbid
excitement
but
this
was
not
all
they
were
stupendously
ignorant
of
the
world
as
a
class
the
were
mentally
and
provincial
to
a
degree
rarely
known
they
were
a
close
society
on
whom
the
new
fountains
of
power
had
poured
a
stream
of
wealth
and
slaves
that
acted
like
oil
on
flame
they
showed
a
young
student
his
first
of
the
way
in
which
excess
of
power
worked
when
held
by
inadequate
hands
this
might
be
a
commonplace
of
but
in
it
was
paradox
the
southern
statesmen
were
regarded
as
standards
of
statesmanship
and
such
standards
barred
education
charles
chief
offence
was
his
insistence
on
southern
ignorance
and
he
stood
a
living
proof
of
it
to
this
school
henry
adams
had
come
for
a
new
education
and
the
school
was
seriously
honestly
taken
by
most
of
the
world
including
europe
as
proper
for
the
purpose
although
the
sioux
indians
would
have
taught
less
mischief
from
such
contradictions
among
intelligent
people
what
was
a
young
man
to
learn
he
could
learn
nothing
but
the
old
and
typical
southern
gentleman
developed
as
had
nothing
to
teach
or
to
give
except
warning
even
as
example
to
be
avoided
he
was
too
glaring
in
his
defiance
of
reason
to
help
the
education
of
a
reasonable
being
no
one
learned
a
useful
lesson
from
the
confederate
school
except
to
keep
away
from
it
thus
at
one
sweep
the
whole
field
of
instruction
south
of
the
potomac
was
shut
off
it
was
overshadowed
by
the
cotton
planters
from
whom
one
could
learn
nothing
but
bad
temper
bad
manners
poker
and
treason
perforce
the
student
was
thrown
back
on
northern
precept
and
example
first
of
all
on
his
new
england
surroundings
republican
houses
were
few
in
washington
and
and
adams
aimed
to
create
a
social
centre
for
new
englanders
they
took
a
house
on
i
street
looking
over
pennsylvania
avenue
well
out
towards
georgetown
the
markoe
house
and
there
the
private
secretary
began
to
learn
his
social
duties
for
the
political
were
confined
to
and
lobbies
of
the
capitol
he
had
little
to
do
and
knew
not
how
to
do
it
rightly
but
he
knew
of
no
one
who
knew
more
the
southern
type
was
one
to
be
avoided
the
new
england
type
was
one
self
it
had
nothing
to
show
except
one
own
features
setting
aside
charles
sumner
who
stood
quite
alone
and
was
the
oldest
friend
all
the
new
englanders
were
sane
and
steady
men
educated
and
free
from
meanness
or
intrigue
men
whom
one
liked
to
act
with
and
who
whether
graduates
or
not
bore
the
stamp
of
harvard
college
anson
burlingame
was
one
exception
and
perhaps
israel
washburn
another
but
as
a
rule
the
new
strength
was
his
poise
which
almost
amounted
to
a
defect
he
offered
no
more
target
for
love
than
for
hate
he
attracted
as
little
as
he
repelled
even
as
a
machine
his
motion
seemed
never
accelerated
the
character
with
its
force
or
feebleness
was
familiar
one
knew
it
to
the
core
one
was
it
had
been
run
in
the
same
mould
there
remained
the
central
and
western
states
but
there
the
choice
of
teachers
was
not
large
and
in
the
end
narrowed
itself
to
preston
king
henry
winter
davis
owen
lovejoy
and
a
few
other
men
born
with
social
faculty
adams
took
most
kindly
to
henry
raymond
who
came
to
view
the
field
for
the
new
york
times
and
who
was
a
man
of
the
world
the
average
congressman
was
civil
enough
but
had
nothing
to
ask
except
offices
and
nothing
to
offer
but
the
views
of
his
district
the
average
senator
was
more
reserved
but
had
not
much
more
to
say
being
always
excepting
one
or
two
genial
natures
handicapped
by
his
own
importance
study
it
as
one
might
the
hope
of
education
till
the
arrival
of
the
narrowed
itself
to
the
possible
influence
of
only
two
men
sumner
and
seward
sumner
was
then
fifty
years
old
since
his
election
as
senator
in
he
had
passed
beyond
the
reach
of
his
boy
friend
and
after
his
brooks
injuries
his
nervous
system
never
quite
recovered
its
tone
but
perhaps
eight
or
ten
years
of
solitary
existence
as
senator
had
most
to
do
with
his
development
no
man
however
strong
can
serve
ten
years
as
schoolmaster
priest
or
senator
and
remain
fit
for
anything
else
all
the
dogmatic
stations
in
life
have
the
effect
of
fixing
a
certain
stiffness
of
attitude
forever
as
though
they
mesmerized
the
subject
yet
even
among
senators
there
were
degrees
in
dogmatism
from
the
frank
south
carolinian
brutality
to
that
of
webster
benton
clay
or
sumner
himself
until
in
extreme
cases
like
conkling
it
became
shakespearian
and
bouffe
as
godkin
used
to
call
it
like
malvolio
sumner
had
become
dogmatic
like
the
rest
but
he
had
at
least
the
merit
of
qualities
that
warranted
dogmatism
he
justly
thought
as
webster
had
thought
before
him
that
his
great
services
and
sacrifices
his
superiority
in
education
his
oratorical
power
his
political
experience
his
representative
character
at
the
head
of
the
whole
new
england
contingent
and
above
all
his
knowledge
of
the
world
made
him
the
most
important
member
of
the
senate
and
no
senator
had
ever
saturated
himself
more
thoroughly
with
the
spirit
and
temper
of
the
body
although
the
senate
is
much
given
to
admiring
in
its
members
a
superiority
less
obvious
or
quite
invisible
to
outsiders
one
senator
seldom
proclaims
his
own
inferiority
to
another
and
still
more
seldom
likes
to
be
told
of
it
even
the
greatest
senators
seemed
to
inspire
little
personal
affection
in
each
other
and
betrayed
none
at
all
sumner
had
a
number
of
rivals
who
held
his
judgment
in
no
high
esteem
and
one
of
these
was
senator
seward
the
two
men
would
have
disliked
each
other
by
instinct
had
they
lived
in
different
planets
each
was
created
only
for
exasperating
the
other
the
virtues
of
one
were
the
faults
of
his
rival
until
no
good
quality
seemed
to
remain
of
either
that
the
public
service
must
suffer
was
certain
but
what
were
the
sufferings
of
the
public
service
compared
with
the
risks
run
by
a
young
mosquito
a
private
secretary
trying
to
buzz
admiration
in
the
ears
of
each
and
unaware
that
each
would
impatiently
slap
at
him
for
belonging
to
the
other
innocent
and
unsuspicious
beyond
what
was
permitted
even
in
a
nursery
the
private
secretary
courted
both
private
secretaries
are
servants
of
a
rather
low
order
whose
business
is
to
serve
sources
of
power
the
first
news
of
a
professional
kind
imparted
to
private
secretary
adams
on
reaching
washington
was
that
the
abraham
lincoln
had
selected
seward
for
his
secretary
of
state
and
that
seward
was
to
be
the
medium
for
communicating
his
wishes
to
his
followers
every
young
man
naturally
accepted
the
wishes
of
lincoln
as
orders
the
more
because
he
could
see
that
the
new
president
was
likely
to
need
all
the
help
that
several
million
young
men
would
be
able
to
give
if
they
counted
on
having
any
president
at
all
to
serve
naturally
one
waited
impatiently
for
the
first
meeting
with
the
new
secretary
of
state
governor
seward
was
an
old
friend
of
the
family
he
professed
to
be
a
disciple
and
follower
of
john
quincy
adams
he
had
been
senator
since
when
his
responsibilities
as
leader
had
separated
him
from
the
free
soil
contingent
for
in
the
dry
light
of
the
first
free
soil
faith
the
ways
of
new
york
politics
thurlow
weed
had
not
won
favor
but
the
fierce
heat
which
welded
the
republican
party
in
melted
many
such
barriers
and
when
adams
came
to
congress
in
december
governor
seward
instantly
renewed
his
attitude
of
family
friend
became
a
daily
intimate
in
the
household
and
lost
no
chance
of
forcing
his
fresh
ally
to
the
front
a
few
days
after
their
arrival
in
december
the
governor
as
he
was
always
called
came
to
dinner
alone
as
one
of
the
family
and
the
private
secretary
had
the
chance
he
wanted
to
watch
him
as
carefully
as
one
generally
watches
men
who
dispose
of
one
future
a
slouching
slender
figure
a
head
like
a
wise
macaw
a
beaked
nose
shaggy
eyebrows
unorderly
hair
and
clothes
hoarse
voice
offhand
manner
free
talk
and
perpetual
cigar
offered
a
new
type
of
western
new
york
to
fathom
a
type
in
one
way
simple
because
it
was
only
double
political
and
personal
but
complex
because
the
political
had
become
nature
and
no
one
could
tell
which
was
the
mask
and
which
the
features
at
table
among
friends
seward
threw
off
restraint
or
seemed
to
throw
it
off
in
reality
while
in
the
world
he
threw
it
off
like
a
politician
for
effect
in
both
cases
he
chose
to
appear
as
a
free
talker
who
loathed
pomposity
and
enjoyed
a
joke
but
how
much
was
nature
and
how
much
was
mask
he
was
himself
too
simple
a
nature
to
know
underneath
the
surface
he
was
conventional
after
the
conventions
of
western
new
york
and
albany
politicians
thought
it
unconventionality
bostonians
thought
it
provincial
henry
adams
thought
it
charming
from
the
first
sight
he
loved
the
governor
who
though
sixty
years
old
had
the
youth
of
his
sympathies
he
noticed
that
seward
was
never
petty
or
personal
his
talk
was
large
he
generalized
he
never
seemed
to
pose
for
statesmanship
he
did
not
require
an
attitude
of
prayer
what
was
more
unusual
almost
singular
and
quite
eccentric
he
had
some
means
unknown
to
other
senators
of
producing
the
effect
of
unselfishness
superficially
seward
and
adams
were
contrasts
essentially
they
were
much
alike
adams
was
taken
to
be
rigid
but
the
puritan
character
in
all
its
forms
could
be
supple
enough
when
it
chose
and
in
massachusetts
all
the
adamses
had
been
attacked
in
succession
as
no
better
than
political
mercenaries
hildreth
in
his
standard
history
went
so
far
as
to
echo
with
approval
the
charge
that
treachery
was
hereditary
in
the
family
any
adams
had
at
least
to
be
hardened
to
every
contradictory
epithet
that
virtue
could
supply
and
on
the
whole
armed
to
return
such
attentions
but
all
must
have
admitted
that
they
had
invariably
subordinated
local
to
national
interests
and
would
continue
to
do
so
whenever
forced
to
choose
adams
was
sure
to
do
what
his
father
had
done
as
his
father
had
followed
the
steps
of
john
adams
and
no
doubt
thereby
earned
his
epithets
the
inevitable
followed
as
a
child
fresh
from
the
nursery
should
have
had
the
instinct
to
foresee
but
the
young
man
on
the
edge
of
life
never
dreamed
what
motives
or
emotions
drove
his
masters
on
their
various
paths
he
made
no
pretence
of
guessing
even
at
that
age
he
preferred
to
admit
his
dislike
for
guessing
motives
he
knew
only
his
own
infantile
ignorance
before
which
he
stood
amazed
and
his
innocent
always
matter
of
surprise
critics
who
know
ultimate
truth
will
pronounce
judgment
on
history
all
that
henry
adams
ever
saw
in
man
was
a
reflection
of
his
own
ignorance
and
he
never
saw
quite
so
much
of
it
as
in
the
winter
of
every
one
knows
the
story
every
one
draws
what
conclusion
suits
his
temper
and
the
conclusion
matters
now
less
than
though
it
concerned
the
merits
of
adam
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
eden
but
in
the
conclusion
made
the
sharpest
lesson
of
life
it
was
condensed
and
concentrated
education
rightly
or
wrongly
the
new
president
and
his
chief
advisers
in
washington
decided
that
before
they
could
administer
the
government
they
must
make
sure
of
a
government
to
administer
and
that
this
chance
depended
on
the
action
of
virginia
the
whole
ascendancy
of
the
winter
wavered
between
the
effort
of
the
cotton
states
to
drag
virginia
out
and
the
effort
of
the
new
president
to
keep
virginia
in
governor
seward
representing
the
administration
in
the
senate
took
the
lead
adams
took
the
lead
in
the
house
and
as
far
as
a
private
secretary
knew
the
party
united
on
its
tactics
in
offering
concessions
to
the
border
states
they
had
to
run
the
risk
or
incur
the
certainty
of
dividing
their
own
party
and
they
took
this
risk
with
open
eyes
as
seward
himself
in
his
gruff
way
said
at
dinner
after
adams
and
he
had
made
their
speeches
if
there
no
secession
now
you
and
i
are
ruined
they
won
their
game
this
was
their
affair
and
the
affair
of
the
historians
who
tell
their
story
their
private
secretaries
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
to
follow
their
orders
on
that
side
a
secretary
learned
nothing
and
had
nothing
to
learn
the
sudden
arrival
of
lincoln
in
washington
on
february
and
the
language
of
his
inaugural
address
were
the
final
term
of
the
winter
tactics
and
closed
the
private
secretary
interest
in
the
matter
forever
perhaps
he
felt
even
then
a
good
deal
more
interest
in
the
appearance
of
another
private
secretary
of
his
own
age
a
young
man
named
john
hay
who
lighted
on
lafayette
square
at
the
same
moment
friends
are
born
not
made
and
henry
never
mistook
a
friend
except
when
in
power
from
the
first
slight
meeting
in
february
and
march
he
recognized
hay
as
a
friend
and
never
lost
sight
of
him
at
the
future
crossing
of
their
paths
but
for
the
moment
his
own
task
ended
on
march
when
hay
began
the
winter
anxieties
were
shifted
upon
new
shoulders
and
henry
gladly
turned
back
to
blackstone
he
had
tried
to
make
himself
useful
and
had
exerted
energy
that
seemed
to
him
portentous
acting
in
secret
as
newspaper
correspondent
cultivating
a
large
acquaintance
and
even
haunting
ballrooms
where
the
simple
southern
tone
was
pleasant
even
in
the
atmosphere
of
conspiracy
and
treason
the
sum
was
next
to
nothing
for
education
because
no
one
could
teach
all
were
as
ignorant
as
himself
none
knew
what
should
be
done
or
how
to
do
it
all
were
trying
to
learn
and
were
more
bent
on
asking
than
on
answering
questions
the
mass
of
ignorance
in
washington
was
lighted
up
by
no
ray
of
knowledge
society
from
top
to
bottom
broke
down
from
this
law
there
was
no
exception
unless
perhaps
that
of
old
general
winfield
scott
who
happened
to
be
the
only
military
figure
that
looked
equal
to
the
crisis
no
one
else
either
looked
it
or
was
it
or
could
be
it
by
nature
or
training
had
young
adams
been
told
that
his
life
was
to
hang
on
the
correctness
of
his
estimate
of
the
new
president
he
would
have
lost
he
saw
lincoln
but
once
at
the
melancholy
function
called
an
inaugural
ball
of
course
he
looked
anxiously
for
a
sign
of
character
he
saw
a
long
awkward
figure
a
plain
ploughed
face
a
mind
absent
in
part
and
in
part
evidently
worried
by
white
kid
gloves
features
that
expressed
neither
nor
any
other
familiar
americanism
but
rather
the
same
painful
sense
of
becoming
educated
and
of
needing
education
that
tormented
a
private
secretary
above
all
a
lack
of
apparent
force
any
private
secretary
in
the
least
fit
for
his
business
would
have
thought
as
adams
did
that
no
man
living
needed
so
much
education
as
the
new
president
but
that
all
the
education
he
could
get
would
not
be
enough
as
far
as
a
young
man
of
anxious
temperament
could
see
no
one
in
washington
was
fitted
for
his
duties
or
rather
no
duties
in
march
were
fitted
for
the
duties
in
april
the
few
people
who
thought
they
knew
something
were
more
in
error
than
those
who
knew
nothing
education
was
matter
of
life
and
death
but
all
the
education
in
the
world
would
have
helped
nothing
only
one
man
in
adams
reach
seemed
to
him
supremely
fitted
by
knowledge
and
experience
to
be
an
adviser
and
friend
this
was
senator
sumner
and
there
in
fact
the
young
man
education
began
there
it
ended
going
over
the
experience
again
long
after
all
the
great
actors
were
dead
he
struggled
to
see
where
he
had
blundered
in
the
effort
to
make
acquaintances
he
lost
friends
but
he
would
have
liked
much
to
know
whether
he
could
have
helped
it
he
had
necessarily
followed
seward
and
his
father
he
took
for
granted
that
his
business
was
obedience
discipline
and
silence
he
supposed
the
party
to
require
it
and
that
the
crisis
overruled
all
personal
doubts
he
was
thunderstruck
to
learn
that
senator
sumner
privately
denounced
the
course
regarded
adams
as
betraying
the
principles
of
his
life
and
broke
off
relations
with
his
family
many
a
shock
was
henry
adams
to
meet
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
passed
chiefly
near
politics
and
politicians
but
the
profoundest
lessons
are
not
the
lessons
of
reason
they
are
sudden
strains
that
permanently
warp
the
mind
he
cared
little
or
nothing
about
the
point
in
discussion
he
was
even
willing
to
admit
that
sumner
might
be
right
though
in
all
great
emergencies
he
commonly
found
that
every
one
was
more
or
less
wrong
he
liked
lofty
moral
principle
and
cared
little
for
political
tactics
he
felt
a
profound
respect
for
sumner
himself
but
the
shock
opened
a
chasm
in
life
that
never
closed
and
as
long
as
life
lasted
he
found
himself
invariably
taking
for
granted
as
a
political
instinct
with
out
waiting
further
experiment
as
he
took
for
granted
that
arsenic
poisoned
the
rule
that
a
friend
in
power
is
a
friend
lost
on
his
own
score
he
never
admitted
the
rupture
and
never
exchanged
a
word
with
sumner
on
the
subject
then
or
afterwards
but
his
education
for
good
or
bad
made
an
enormous
stride
one
has
to
deal
with
all
sorts
of
unexpected
morals
in
life
and
at
this
moment
he
was
looking
at
hundreds
of
southern
gentlemen
who
believed
themselves
singularly
honest
but
who
seemed
to
him
engaged
in
the
plainest
breach
of
faith
and
the
blackest
secret
conspiracy
yet
they
did
not
disturb
his
education
history
told
of
little
else
and
not
one
rebel
defection
not
even
robert
lee
cost
young
adams
a
personal
pang
but
sumner
struck
home
this
then
was
the
result
of
the
new
attempt
at
education
down
to
march
this
was
all
and
frankly
it
seemed
to
him
hardly
what
he
wanted
the
picture
of
washington
in
march
offered
education
but
not
the
kind
of
education
that
led
to
good
the
process
that
matthew
arnold
described
as
wandering
between
two
worlds
one
dead
the
other
powerless
to
be
born
helps
nothing
washington
was
a
dismal
school
even
before
the
traitors
had
flown
the
vultures
descended
on
it
in
swarms
that
darkened
the
ground
and
tore
the
carrion
of
political
patronage
into
fragments
and
gobbets
of
fat
and
lean
on
the
very
steps
of
the
white
house
not
a
man
there
knew
what
his
task
was
to
be
or
was
fitted
for
it
every
one
without
exception
northern
or
southern
was
to
learn
his
business
at
the
cost
of
the
public
lincoln
seward
sumner
and
the
rest
could
give
no
help
to
the
young
man
seeking
education
they
knew
less
than
he
within
six
weeks
they
were
all
to
be
taught
their
duties
by
the
uprising
of
such
as
he
and
their
education
was
to
cost
a
million
lives
and
ten
thousand
million
dollars
more
or
less
north
and
south
before
the
country
could
recover
its
balance
and
movement
henry
was
a
helpless
victim
and
like
all
the
rest
he
could
only
wait
for
he
knew
not
what
to
send
him
he
knew
not
where
with
the
close
of
the
session
his
own
functions
ended
ceasing
to
be
private
secretary
he
knew
not
what
else
to
do
but
return
with
his
father
and
mother
to
boston
in
the
middle
of
march
and
with
childlike
docility
sit
down
at
a
desk
in
the
of
horace
gray
in
court
street
to
begin
again
my
lords
and
gentlemen
dozing
after
a
two
dinner
or
waking
to
discuss
politics
with
the
future
justice
there
in
ordinary
times
he
would
have
remained
for
life
his
attempt
at
education
in
treason
having
like
all
the
rest
disastrously
failed
chapter
viii
diplomacy
hardly
a
week
passed
when
the
newspapers
announced
that
president
lincoln
had
selected
charles
francis
adams
as
his
minister
to
england
once
more
silently
henry
put
blackstone
back
on
its
shelf
as
friar
bacon
head
sententiously
announced
many
centuries
before
time
had
passed
the
civil
law
lasted
a
brief
day
the
common
law
prolonged
its
shadowy
existence
for
a
week
the
law
altogether
as
path
of
education
vanished
in
april
leaving
a
million
young
men
planted
in
the
mud
of
a
lawless
world
to
begin
a
new
life
without
education
at
all
they
asked
few
questions
but
if
they
had
asked
millions
they
would
have
got
no
answers
no
one
could
help
looking
back
on
this
moment
of
crisis
nearly
fifty
years
afterwards
one
could
only
shake
one
white
beard
in
silent
horror
adams
once
more
intimated
that
he
thought
himself
entitled
to
the
services
of
one
of
his
sons
and
he
indicated
henry
as
the
only
one
who
could
be
spared
from
more
serious
duties
henry
packed
his
trunk
again
without
a
word
he
could
offer
no
protest
ridiculous
as
he
knew
himself
about
to
be
in
his
new
role
he
was
less
ridiculous
than
his
betters
he
was
at
least
no
public
official
like
the
thousands
of
improvised
secretaries
and
generals
who
crowded
their
jealousies
and
intrigues
on
the
president
he
was
not
a
vulture
of
carrion
patronage
he
knew
that
his
appointment
was
the
result
of
governor
seward
personal
friendship
he
did
not
then
know
that
senator
sumner
had
opposed
it
or
the
reasons
which
sumner
alleged
for
thinking
it
unfit
but
he
could
have
supplied
proofs
enough
had
sumner
asked
for
them
the
strongest
and
most
decisive
being
that
in
his
opinion
adams
had
chosen
a
private
secretary
far
more
unfit
than
his
chief
that
adams
was
unfit
might
well
be
since
it
was
hard
to
find
a
fit
appointment
in
the
list
of
possible
candidates
except
sumner
himself
and
no
one
knew
so
well
as
this
experienced
senator
that
the
weakest
of
all
adams
proofs
of
fitness
was
his
consent
to
quit
a
safe
seat
in
congress
for
an
exceedingly
unsafe
seat
in
london
with
no
better
support
than
senator
sumner
at
the
head
of
the
foreign
relations
committee
was
likely
to
give
him
in
the
family
history
its
members
had
taken
many
a
dangerous
risk
but
never
before
had
they
taken
one
so
desperate
the
private
secretary
troubled
himself
not
at
all
about
the
unfitness
of
any
one
he
knew
too
little
and
in
fact
no
one
except
perhaps
sumner
knew
more
the
president
and
secretary
of
state
knew
least
of
all
as
secretary
of
legation
the
executive
appointed
the
editor
of
a
chicago
newspaper
who
had
applied
for
the
chicago
a
good
fellow
universally
known
as
charley
wilson
who
had
not
a
thought
of
staying
in
the
post
or
of
helping
the
minister
the
assistant
secretary
was
inherited
from
buchanan
time
a
hard
worker
but
socially
useless
adams
made
no
effort
to
find
efficient
help
perhaps
he
knew
no
name
to
suggest
perhaps
he
knew
too
much
of
washington
but
he
could
hardly
have
hoped
to
find
a
staff
of
strength
in
his
son
the
private
secretary
was
more
passive
than
his
father
for
he
knew
not
where
to
turn
sumner
alone
could
have
smoothed
his
path
by
giving
him
letters
of
introduction
but
if
sumner
wrote
letters
it
was
not
with
the
effect
of
smoothing
paths
no
one
at
that
moment
was
engaged
in
smoothing
either
paths
or
people
the
private
secretary
was
no
worse
off
than
his
neighbors
except
in
being
called
earlier
into
service
on
april
the
storm
burst
and
rolled
several
hundred
thousand
young
men
like
henry
adams
into
the
surf
of
a
wild
ocean
all
helpless
like
himself
to
be
beaten
about
for
four
years
by
the
waves
of
war
adams
still
had
time
to
watch
the
regiments
form
ranks
before
boston
state
house
in
the
april
evenings
and
march
southward
quietly
enough
with
the
air
of
business
they
wore
from
their
cradles
but
with
few
signs
or
sounds
of
excitement
he
had
time
also
to
go
down
the
harbor
to
see
his
brother
charles
quartered
in
fort
independence
before
being
thrown
with
a
hundred
thousand
more
into
the
furnace
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
to
get
educated
in
a
fury
of
fire
few
things
were
for
the
moment
so
trivial
in
importance
as
the
solitary
private
secretary
crawling
down
to
the
wretched
old
cunard
steamer
niagara
at
east
boston
to
start
again
for
liverpool
this
time
the
pitcher
of
education
had
gone
to
the
fountain
once
too
often
it
was
fairly
broken
and
the
young
man
had
got
to
meet
a
hostile
world
without
defence
or
arms
the
situation
did
not
seem
even
comic
so
ignorant
was
the
world
of
its
humors
yet
minister
adams
sailed
for
england
may
with
much
the
same
outfit
as
admiral
dupont
would
have
enjoyed
if
the
government
had
sent
him
to
attack
port
royal
with
one
in
a
rowboat
luckily
for
the
he
was
alone
had
secretary
seward
and
senator
sumner
given
to
adams
the
rank
of
ambassador
and
four
times
his
salary
a
palace
in
london
a
staff
of
trained
secretaries
and
personal
letters
of
introduction
to
the
royal
family
and
the
whole
peerage
the
private
secretary
would
have
been
still
with
the
extra
burden
of
many
masters
he
was
the
most
fortunate
person
in
the
party
having
for
master
only
his
father
who
never
fretted
never
dictated
never
disciplined
and
whose
idea
of
american
diplomacy
was
that
of
the
eighteenth
century
minister
adams
remembered
how
his
grandfather
had
sailed
from
mount
wollaston
in
midwinter
on
the
little
frigate
boston
taking
his
son
john
quincy
with
him
for
secretary
on
a
diplomacy
of
adventure
that
had
hardly
a
parallel
for
success
he
remembered
how
john
quincy
in
had
sailed
for
russia
with
himself
a
baby
of
two
years
old
to
cope
with
napoleon
and
the
czar
alexander
almost
as
much
of
an
adventurer
as
john
adams
before
him
and
almost
as
successful
he
thought
it
natural
that
the
government
should
send
him
out
as
an
adventurer
also
with
a
son
and
he
did
not
even
notice
that
he
left
not
a
friend
behind
him
no
doubt
he
could
depend
on
seward
but
on
whom
could
seward
depend
certainly
not
on
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
foreign
relations
minister
adams
had
no
friend
in
the
senate
he
could
hope
for
no
favors
and
he
asked
none
he
thought
it
right
to
play
the
adventurer
as
his
father
and
grandfather
had
done
before
him
without
a
murmur
this
was
a
lofty
view
and
for
him
answered
his
objects
but
it
bore
hard
on
and
when
in
time
the
young
man
realized
what
had
happened
he
felt
it
as
a
betrayal
he
modestly
thought
himself
unfit
for
the
career
of
adventurer
and
judged
his
father
to
be
less
fit
than
himself
for
the
first
time
america
was
posing
as
the
champion
of
legitimacy
and
order
her
representatives
should
know
how
to
play
their
role
they
should
wear
the
costume
but
in
the
mission
attached
to
adams
in
the
only
rag
of
legitimacy
or
order
was
the
private
secretary
whose
stature
was
not
sufficient
to
impose
awe
on
the
court
and
parliament
of
great
britain
one
inevitable
effect
of
this
lesson
was
to
make
a
victim
of
the
scholar
and
to
turn
him
into
a
harsh
judge
of
his
masters
if
they
overlooked
him
he
could
hardly
overlook
them
since
they
stood
with
their
whole
weight
on
his
body
by
way
of
teaching
him
quickly
they
sent
out
their
new
minister
to
russia
in
the
same
ship
secretary
seward
had
occasion
to
learn
the
merits
of
cassius
clay
in
the
diplomatic
service
but
seward
education
profited
less
than
the
private
secretary
cassius
clay
as
a
teacher
having
no
equal
though
possibly
some
rivals
no
young
man
not
in
government
pay
could
be
asked
to
draw
from
such
lessons
any
confidence
in
himself
and
it
was
notorious
that
for
the
next
two
years
the
persons
were
few
indeed
who
felt
or
had
reason
to
feel
any
sort
of
confidence
in
the
government
fewest
of
all
among
those
who
were
in
it
at
home
for
the
most
part
young
men
went
to
the
war
grumbled
and
died
in
england
they
might
grumble
or
not
no
one
listened
above
all
the
private
secretary
could
not
grumble
to
his
chief
he
knew
surprisingly
little
but
that
much
he
did
know
he
never
labored
so
hard
to
learn
a
language
as
he
did
to
hold
his
tongue
and
it
affected
him
for
life
the
habit
of
reticence
of
talking
without
meaning
is
never
effaced
he
had
to
begin
it
at
once
he
was
already
an
adept
when
the
party
landed
at
liverpool
may
and
went
instantly
up
to
london
a
family
of
early
christian
martyrs
about
to
be
flung
into
an
arena
of
lions
under
the
glad
eyes
of
tiberius
palmerston
though
lord
palmerston
would
have
laughed
his
peculiar
palmerston
laugh
at
figuring
as
tiberius
he
would
have
seen
only
evident
resemblance
in
the
christian
martyrs
for
he
had
already
arranged
the
ceremony
of
what
they
had
to
expect
the
minister
knew
no
more
than
his
son
what
he
or
seward
or
sumner
may
have
thought
is
the
affair
of
history
and
their
errors
concern
historians
the
errors
of
a
private
secretary
concerned
no
one
but
himself
and
were
a
large
part
of
his
education
he
thought
on
may
that
he
was
going
to
a
friendly
government
and
people
true
to
the
principles
which
had
been
their
steadiest
profession
for
a
hundred
years
the
chief
effort
of
his
family
had
aimed
at
bringing
the
government
of
england
into
intelligent
cooperation
with
the
objects
and
interests
of
america
his
father
was
about
to
make
a
new
effort
and
this
time
the
chance
of
success
was
promising
the
slave
states
had
been
the
chief
apparent
obstacle
to
good
understanding
as
for
the
private
secretary
himself
he
was
like
all
bostonians
instinctively
english
he
could
not
conceive
the
idea
of
a
hostile
england
he
supposed
himself
as
one
of
the
members
of
a
famous
family
to
be
welcome
everywhere
in
the
british
islands
on
may
he
met
the
official
announcement
that
england
recognized
the
belligerency
of
the
confederacy
this
beginning
of
a
new
education
tore
up
by
the
roots
nearly
all
that
was
left
of
harvard
college
and
germany
he
had
to
learn
the
sooner
the
better
that
his
ideas
were
the
reverse
of
truth
that
in
may
no
one
in
england
literally
no
one
doubted
that
jefferson
davis
had
made
or
would
make
a
nation
and
nearly
all
were
glad
of
it
though
not
often
saying
so
they
mostly
imitated
palmerston
who
according
to
gladstone
desired
the
severance
as
a
diminution
of
a
dangerous
power
but
prudently
held
his
tongue
the
sentiment
of
had
disappeared
lord
john
russell
as
foreign
secretary
had
received
the
rebel
emissaries
and
had
decided
to
recognize
their
belligerency
before
the
arrival
of
adams
in
order
to
fix
the
position
of
the
british
government
in
advance
the
recognition
of
independence
would
then
become
an
understood
policy
a
matter
of
time
and
occasion
whatever
minister
adams
may
have
felt
the
first
effect
of
this
shock
upon
his
son
produced
only
a
dullness
of
comprehension
a
sort
of
hazy
inability
to
grasp
the
missile
or
realize
the
blow
yet
he
realized
that
to
his
father
it
was
likely
to
be
fatal
the
chances
were
great
that
the
whole
family
would
turn
round
and
go
home
within
a
few
weeks
the
horizon
widened
out
in
endless
waves
of
confusion
when
he
thought
over
the
subject
in
the
long
leisure
of
later
life
he
grew
cold
at
the
idea
of
his
situation
had
his
father
then
shown
himself
what
sumner
thought
him
to
be
unfit
for
his
post
that
the
private
secretary
was
unfit
for
his
trifling
though
it
were
was
proved
by
his
unreflecting
confidence
in
his
father
it
never
entered
his
mind
that
his
father
might
lose
his
nerve
or
his
temper
and
yet
in
a
subsequent
knowledge
of
statesmen
and
diplomats
extending
over
several
generations
he
could
not
certainly
point
out
another
who
could
have
stood
such
a
shock
without
showing
it
he
passed
this
long
day
and
tedious
journey
to
london
without
once
thinking
of
the
possibility
that
his
father
might
make
a
mistake
whatever
the
minister
thought
and
certainly
his
thought
was
not
less
active
than
his
son
he
showed
no
trace
of
excitement
his
manner
was
the
same
as
ever
his
mind
and
temper
were
as
perfectly
balanced
not
a
word
escaped
not
a
nerve
twitched
the
test
was
final
for
no
other
shock
so
violent
and
sudden
could
possibly
recur
the
worst
was
in
full
sight
for
once
the
private
secretary
knew
his
own
business
which
was
to
imitate
his
father
as
closely
as
possible
and
hold
his
tongue
dumped
thus
into
hotel
at
the
foot
of
regent
street
in
the
midst
of
a
london
season
without
a
friend
or
even
an
acquaintance
he
preferred
to
laugh
at
his
father
bewilderment
before
the
waiter
for
breakfast
rather
than
ask
a
question
or
express
a
doubt
his
situation
if
taken
seriously
was
too
appalling
to
face
had
he
known
it
better
he
would
only
have
thought
it
worse
politically
or
socially
the
outlook
was
desperate
beyond
retrieving
or
contesting
socially
under
the
best
of
circumstances
a
newcomer
in
london
society
needs
years
to
establish
a
position
and
minister
adams
had
not
a
week
or
an
hour
to
spare
while
his
son
had
not
even
a
remote
chance
of
beginning
politically
the
prospect
looked
even
worse
and
for
secretary
seward
and
senator
sumner
it
was
so
but
for
the
minister
on
the
spot
as
he
came
to
realize
exactly
where
he
stood
the
danger
was
not
so
imminent
adams
was
always
one
of
the
luckiest
of
men
both
in
what
he
achieved
and
in
what
he
escaped
the
blow
which
prostrated
seward
and
sumner
passed
over
him
lord
john
russell
had
acted
had
probably
intended
to
act
kindly
by
him
in
forestalling
his
arrival
the
blow
must
have
fallen
within
three
months
and
would
then
have
broken
him
down
the
british
ministers
were
a
little
in
doubt
still
a
little
ashamed
of
themselves
and
certain
to
wait
the
longer
for
their
next
step
in
proportion
to
the
haste
of
their
first
this
is
not
a
story
of
the
diplomatic
adventures
of
charles
francis
adams
but
of
his
son
henry
adventures
in
search
of
an
education
which
if
not
taken
too
seriously
tended
to
humor
the
father
position
in
london
was
not
altogether
bad
the
son
was
absurd
thanks
to
certain
family
associations
charles
francis
adams
naturally
looked
on
all
british
ministers
as
enemies
the
only
public
occupation
of
all
adamses
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
at
least
in
their
brief
intervals
of
quarrelling
with
state
street
had
been
to
quarrel
with
downing
street
and
the
british
government
well
used
to
a
liberal
unpopularity
abroad
even
when
officially
rude
liked
to
be
personally
civil
all
diplomatic
agents
are
liable
to
be
put
so
to
speak
in
a
corner
and
are
none
the
worse
for
it
minister
adams
had
nothing
in
especial
to
complain
of
his
position
was
good
while
it
lasted
and
he
had
only
the
chances
of
war
to
fear
the
son
had
no
such
compensations
brought
over
in
order
to
help
his
father
he
could
conceive
no
way
of
rendering
his
father
help
but
he
was
clear
that
his
father
had
got
to
help
him
to
him
the
legation
was
social
ostracism
terrible
beyond
anything
he
had
known
entire
solitude
in
the
great
society
of
london
was
doubly
desperate
because
his
duties
as
private
secretary
required
him
to
know
everybody
and
go
with
his
father
and
mother
everywhere
they
needed
escort
he
had
no
friend
or
even
enemy
to
tell
him
to
be
patient
had
any
one
done
it
he
would
surely
have
broken
out
with
the
reply
that
patience
was
the
last
resource
of
fools
as
well
as
of
sages
if
he
was
to
help
his
father
at
all
he
must
do
it
at
once
for
his
father
would
never
so
much
need
help
again
in
fact
he
never
gave
his
father
the
smallest
help
unless
it
were
as
a
footman
clerk
or
a
companion
for
the
younger
children
he
found
himself
in
a
singular
situation
for
one
who
was
to
be
useful
as
he
came
to
see
the
situation
closer
he
began
to
doubt
whether
secretaries
were
meant
to
be
useful
wars
were
too
common
in
diplomacy
to
disturb
the
habits
of
the
diplomat
most
secretaries
detested
their
chiefs
and
wished
to
be
anything
but
useful
at
the
james
club
to
which
the
minister
son
could
go
only
as
an
invited
guest
the
most
instructive
conversation
he
ever
heard
among
the
young
men
of
his
own
age
who
hung
about
the
tables
more
helpless
than
himself
was
quel
chien
de
pays
or
que
tu
es
beau
mon
cher
no
one
wanted
to
discuss
affairs
still
less
to
give
or
get
information
that
was
the
affair
of
their
chiefs
who
were
also
slow
to
assume
work
not
specially
ordered
from
their
courts
if
the
american
minister
was
in
trouble
the
russian
ambassador
was
in
trouble
yesterday
and
the
frenchman
would
be
in
trouble
it
would
all
come
in
the
day
work
there
was
nothing
professional
in
worry
empires
were
always
tumbling
to
pieces
and
diplomats
were
always
picking
them
up
this
was
his
whole
diplomatic
education
except
that
he
found
rich
veins
of
jealousy
running
between
every
chief
and
his
staff
his
social
education
was
more
barren
still
and
more
trying
to
his
vanity
his
little
mistakes
in
etiquette
or
address
made
him
writhe
with
torture
he
never
forgot
the
first
two
or
three
social
functions
he
attended
one
an
afternoon
at
miss
burdett
coutts
in
stratton
place
where
he
hid
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
hoped
that
no
one
noticed
him
another
was
a
given
by
the
old
duchess
dowager
of
sutherland
at
chiswick
where
the
american
minister
and
adams
were
kept
in
conversation
by
the
old
duchess
till
every
one
else
went
away
except
the
young
duke
and
his
cousins
who
set
to
playing
on
the
lawn
at
intervals
during
the
next
thirty
years
henry
adams
continued
to
happen
upon
the
duke
who
singularly
enough
was
always
playing
still
another
nightmare
he
suffered
at
a
dance
given
by
the
old
duchess
dowager
of
somerset
a
terrible
vision
in
castanets
who
seized
him
and
forced
him
to
perform
a
highland
fling
before
the
assembled
nobility
and
gentry
with
the
daughter
of
the
turkish
ambassador
for
partner
this
might
seem
humorous
to
some
but
to
him
the
world
turned
to
ashes
when
the
end
of
the
season
came
the
private
secretary
had
not
yet
won
a
private
acquaintance
and
he
hugged
himself
in
his
solitude
when
the
story
of
the
battle
of
bull
run
appeared
in
the
times
he
felt
only
the
wish
to
be
more
private
than
ever
for
bull
run
was
a
worse
diplomatic
than
military
disaster
all
this
is
history
and
can
be
read
by
public
schools
if
they
choose
but
the
curious
and
unexpected
happened
to
the
legation
for
the
effect
of
bull
run
on
them
was
almost
strengthening
they
no
longer
felt
doubt
for
the
next
year
they
went
on
only
from
week
to
week
ready
to
leave
england
at
once
and
never
assuming
more
than
three
months
for
their
limit
europe
was
waiting
to
see
them
go
so
certain
was
the
end
that
no
one
cared
to
hurry
it
so
far
as
a
private
secretary
could
see
this
was
all
that
saved
his
father
for
many
months
he
looked
on
himself
as
lost
or
finished
in
the
character
of
private
secretary
and
as
about
to
begin
without
further
experiment
a
final
education
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
where
he
would
find
most
of
his
friends
enjoying
a
much
pleasanter
life
than
his
own
with
this
idea
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
passed
the
summer
and
the
autumn
and
began
the
winter
any
winter
in
london
is
a
severe
trial
one
first
winter
is
the
most
trying
but
the
month
of
december
in
mansfield
street
portland
place
would
have
gorged
a
glutton
of
gloom
one
afternoon
when
he
was
struggling
to
resist
complete
nervous
depression
in
the
solitude
of
mansfield
street
during
the
absence
of
the
minister
and
adams
on
a
country
visit
reuter
telegram
announcing
the
seizure
of
mason
and
slidell
from
a
british
was
brought
to
the
office
all
three
secretaries
public
and
private
were
there
nervous
as
wild
beasts
under
the
long
strain
on
their
endurance
and
all
three
though
they
knew
it
to
be
not
merely
their
order
of
departure
not
merely
diplomatic
rupture
but
a
declaration
of
war
broke
into
shouts
of
delight
they
were
glad
to
face
the
end
they
saw
it
and
cheered
it
since
england
was
waiting
only
for
its
own
moment
to
strike
they
were
eager
to
strike
first
they
telegraphed
the
news
to
the
minister
who
was
staying
with
monckton
milnes
at
fryston
in
yorkshire
how
adams
took
it
is
told
in
the
lives
of
lord
houghton
and
william
forster
who
was
one
of
the
fryston
party
the
moment
was
for
him
the
crisis
of
his
diplomatic
career
for
the
secretaries
it
was
merely
the
beginning
of
another
intolerable
delay
as
though
they
were
a
military
outpost
waiting
orders
to
quit
an
abandoned
position
at
the
moment
of
sharpest
suspense
the
prince
consort
sickened
and
died
portland
place
at
christmas
in
a
black
fog
was
never
a
rosy
landscape
but
in
the
most
hardened
londoner
lost
his
ruddiness
the
private
secretary
had
one
source
of
comfort
denied
to
them
he
should
not
be
private
secretary
long
he
was
mistaken
of
course
he
had
been
mistaken
at
every
point
of
his
education
and
on
this
point
he
kept
up
the
same
mistake
for
nearly
seven
years
longer
always
deluded
by
the
notion
that
the
end
was
near
to
him
the
trent
affair
was
nothing
but
one
of
many
affairs
which
he
had
to
copy
in
a
delicate
round
hand
into
his
books
yet
it
had
one
or
two
results
personal
to
him
which
left
no
trace
on
the
legation
records
one
of
these
and
to
him
the
most
important
was
to
put
an
end
forever
to
the
idea
of
being
useful
hitherto
as
an
independent
and
free
citizen
not
in
the
employ
of
the
government
he
had
kept
up
his
relations
with
the
american
press
he
had
written
pretty
frequently
to
henry
raymond
and
raymond
had
used
his
letters
in
the
new
york
times
he
had
also
become
fairly
intimate
with
the
two
or
three
friendly
newspapers
in
london
the
daily
news
the
star
the
weekly
spectator
and
he
had
tried
to
give
them
news
and
views
that
should
have
a
certain
common
character
and
prevent
clash
he
had
even
gone
down
to
manchester
to
study
the
cotton
famine
and
wrote
a
long
account
of
his
visit
which
his
brother
charles
had
published
in
the
boston
courier
unfortunately
it
was
printed
with
his
name
and
instantly
came
back
upon
him
in
the
most
crushing
shape
possible
that
of
a
long
satirical
leader
in
the
london
times
luckily
the
times
did
not
know
its
victim
to
be
a
part
though
not
an
official
of
the
legation
and
lost
the
chance
to
make
its
satire
fatal
but
he
instantly
learned
the
narrowness
of
his
escape
from
old
joe
parkes
one
of
the
traditional
of
politics
who
had
haunted
london
since
and
who
after
rushing
to
the
times
office
to
tell
them
all
they
did
not
know
about
henry
adams
rushed
to
the
legation
to
tell
adams
all
he
did
not
want
to
know
about
the
times
for
a
moment
adams
thought
his
usefulness
at
an
end
in
other
respects
than
in
the
press
but
a
day
or
two
more
taught
him
the
value
of
obscurity
he
was
totally
unknown
he
had
not
even
a
club
london
was
empty
no
one
thought
twice
about
the
times
article
no
one
except
joe
parkes
ever
spoke
of
it
and
the
world
had
other
persons
such
as
president
lincoln
secretary
seward
and
commodore
wilkes
for
constant
and
favorite
objects
of
ridicule
henry
adams
escaped
but
he
never
tried
to
be
useful
again
the
trent
affair
dwarfed
individual
effort
his
education
at
least
had
reached
the
point
of
seeing
its
own
proportions
surtout
point
de
zele
zeal
was
too
hazardous
a
profession
for
a
minister
son
to
pursue
as
a
volunteer
manipulator
among
trent
affairs
and
rebel
cruisers
he
wrote
no
more
letters
and
meddled
with
no
more
newspapers
but
he
was
still
young
and
felt
unkindly
towards
the
editor
of
the
london
times
delane
lost
few
opportunities
of
embittering
him
and
he
felt
little
or
no
hope
of
repaying
these
attentions
but
the
trent
affair
passed
like
a
snowstorm
leaving
the
legation
to
its
surprise
still
in
place
although
the
private
secretary
saw
in
this
delay
which
he
attributed
to
seward
good
sense
no
reason
for
changing
his
opinion
about
the
views
of
the
british
government
he
had
no
choice
but
to
sit
down
again
at
his
table
and
go
on
copying
papers
filing
letters
and
reading
newspaper
accounts
of
the
incapacity
of
lincoln
and
the
brutality
of
seward
or
vice
versa
the
heavy
months
dragged
on
and
winter
slowly
turned
to
spring
without
improving
his
position
or
spirits
socially
he
had
but
one
relief
and
to
the
end
of
life
he
never
forgot
the
keen
gratitude
he
owed
for
it
during
this
tedious
winter
and
for
many
months
afterwards
the
only
gleams
of
sunshine
were
on
the
days
he
passed
at
as
the
guest
of
and
russell
sturgis
at
mount
felix
his
education
had
unfortunately
little
to
do
with
bankers
although
old
george
peabody
and
his
partner
junius
morgan
were
strong
allies
joshua
bates
was
devoted
and
no
one
could
be
kinder
than
thomas
baring
whose
little
dinners
in
upper
grosvenor
street
were
certainly
the
best
in
london
but
none
offered
a
refuge
to
compare
with
mount
felix
and
for
the
first
time
the
refuge
was
a
liberal
education
russell
sturgis
was
one
of
the
women
to
whom
an
intelligent
boy
attaches
himself
as
closely
as
he
can
henry
adams
was
not
a
very
intelligent
boy
and
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
world
but
he
knew
enough
to
understand
that
a
cub
needed
shape
the
kind
of
education
he
most
required
was
that
of
a
charming
woman
and
russell
sturgis
a
dozen
years
older
than
himself
could
have
trained
a
school
of
such
without
an
effort
and
with
infinite
advantage
to
them
near
her
he
half
forgot
the
anxieties
of
portland
place
during
two
years
of
miserable
solitude
she
was
in
this
social
polar
winter
the
single
source
of
warmth
and
light
of
course
the
legation
itself
was
home
and
under
such
pressure
life
in
it
could
be
nothing
but
united
all
the
inmates
made
common
cause
but
this
was
no
education
one
lived
but
was
merely
flayed
alive
yet
while
this
might
be
exactly
true
of
the
younger
members
of
the
household
it
was
not
quite
so
with
the
minister
and
adams
very
slowly
but
quite
steadily
they
gained
foothold
for
some
reason
partly
connected
with
american
sources
british
society
had
begun
with
violent
social
prejudice
against
lincoln
seward
and
all
the
republican
leaders
except
sumner
familiar
as
the
whole
tribe
of
adamses
had
been
for
three
generations
with
the
impenetrable
stupidity
of
the
british
mind
and
weary
of
the
long
struggle
to
teach
it
its
own
interests
the
fourth
generation
could
still
not
quite
persuade
itself
that
this
new
british
prejudice
was
natural
the
private
secretary
suspected
that
americans
in
new
york
and
boston
had
something
to
do
with
it
the
copperhead
was
at
home
in
pall
mall
naturally
the
englishman
was
a
coarse
animal
and
liked
coarseness
had
lincoln
and
seward
been
the
ruffians
supposed
the
average
englishman
would
have
liked
them
the
better
the
exceedingly
quiet
manner
and
the
unassailable
social
position
of
minister
adams
in
no
way
conciliated
them
they
chose
to
ignore
him
since
they
could
not
ridicule
him
lord
john
russell
set
the
example
personally
the
minister
was
to
be
kindly
treated
politically
he
was
negligible
he
was
there
to
be
put
aside
london
and
paris
imitated
lord
john
every
one
waited
to
see
lincoln
and
his
hirelings
disappear
in
one
vast
debacle
all
conceived
that
the
washington
government
would
soon
crumble
and
that
minister
adams
would
vanish
with
the
rest
this
situation
made
minister
adams
an
exception
among
diplomats
european
rulers
for
the
most
part
fought
and
treated
as
members
of
one
family
and
rarely
had
in
view
the
possibility
of
total
extinction
but
the
governments
and
society
of
europe
for
a
year
at
least
regarded
the
washington
government
as
dead
and
its
ministers
as
nullities
minister
adams
was
better
received
than
most
nullities
because
he
made
no
noise
little
by
little
in
private
society
took
the
habit
of
accepting
him
not
so
much
as
a
diplomat
but
rather
as
a
member
of
opposition
or
an
eminent
counsel
retained
for
a
foreign
government
he
was
to
be
received
and
considered
to
be
cordially
treated
as
by
birth
and
manners
one
of
themselves
this
curiously
english
way
of
getting
behind
a
stupidity
gave
the
minister
every
possible
advantage
over
a
european
diplomat
barriers
of
race
language
birth
habit
ceased
to
exist
diplomacy
held
diplomats
apart
in
order
to
save
governments
but
earl
russell
could
not
hold
adams
apart
he
was
undistinguishable
from
a
londoner
in
society
few
londoners
were
so
widely
at
home
none
had
such
double
personality
and
corresponding
double
weight
the
singular
luck
that
took
him
to
fryston
to
meet
the
shock
of
the
trent
affair
under
the
sympathetic
eyes
of
monckton
milnes
and
william
forster
never
afterwards
deserted
him
both
milnes
and
forster
needed
support
and
were
greatly
relieved
to
be
supported
they
saw
what
the
private
secretary
in
may
had
overlooked
the
hopeless
position
they
were
in
if
the
american
minister
made
a
mistake
and
since
his
strength
was
theirs
they
lost
no
time
in
expressing
to
all
the
world
their
estimate
of
the
minister
character
between
them
the
minister
was
almost
safe
one
might
discuss
long
whether
at
that
moment
milnes
or
forster
were
the
more
valuable
ally
since
they
were
influences
of
different
kinds
monckton
milnes
was
a
social
power
in
london
possibly
greater
than
londoners
themselves
quite
understood
for
in
london
society
as
elsewhere
the
dull
and
the
ignorant
made
a
large
majority
and
dull
men
always
laughed
at
monckton
milnes
every
bore
was
used
to
talk
familiarly
about
dicky
milnes
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
of
course
he
himself
affected
social
eccentricity
challenging
ridicule
with
the
indifference
of
one
who
knew
himself
to
be
the
first
wit
in
london
and
a
maker
of
men
of
a
great
many
men
a
word
from
him
went
far
an
invitation
to
his
went
farther
behind
his
almost
falstaffian
mask
and
laugh
of
silenus
he
carried
a
fine
broad
and
high
intelligence
which
no
one
questioned
as
a
young
man
he
had
written
verses
which
some
readers
thought
poetry
and
which
were
certainly
not
altogether
prose
later
in
parliament
he
made
speeches
chiefly
criticised
as
too
good
for
the
place
and
too
high
for
the
audience
socially
he
was
one
of
two
or
three
men
who
went
everywhere
knew
everybody
talked
of
everything
and
had
the
ear
of
ministers
but
unlike
most
wits
he
held
a
social
position
of
his
own
that
ended
in
a
peerage
and
he
had
a
house
in
upper
brook
street
to
which
most
clever
people
were
exceedingly
glad
of
admission
his
breakfasts
were
famous
and
no
one
liked
to
decline
his
invitations
for
it
was
more
dangerous
to
show
timidity
than
to
risk
a
fray
he
was
a
voracious
reader
a
strong
critic
an
art
connoisseur
in
certain
directions
a
collector
of
books
but
above
all
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
by
profession
and
loved
the
contacts
perhaps
the
collisions
of
society
not
even
henry
brougham
dared
do
the
things
he
did
yet
brougham
defied
rebuff
milnes
was
the
of
london
the
gargantuan
type
of
its
refinement
and
coarseness
the
most
universal
figure
of
may
fair
compared
with
him
figures
like
hayward
or
delane
or
venables
or
henry
reeve
were
quite
secondary
but
william
forster
stood
in
a
different
class
forster
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
may
fair
except
in
being
a
yorkshireman
he
was
quite
the
opposite
of
milnes
he
had
at
that
time
no
social
or
political
position
he
never
had
a
vestige
of
milnes
wit
or
variety
he
was
a
tall
rough
ungainly
figure
affecting
the
singular
form
of
which
the
yorkshiremen
and
lancashiremen
seem
to
hold
dear
the
exterior
roughness
assumed
to
cover
an
internal
emotional
almost
sentimental
nature
kindly
he
had
to
be
if
only
by
his
inheritance
from
a
quaker
ancestry
but
he
was
a
friend
one
degree
removed
sentimental
and
emotional
he
must
have
been
or
he
could
never
have
persuaded
a
daughter
of
arnold
to
marry
him
pure
gold
without
a
trace
of
base
metal
honest
unselfish
practical
he
took
up
the
union
cause
and
made
himself
its
champion
as
a
true
yorkshireman
was
sure
to
do
partly
because
of
his
quaker
convictions
and
partly
because
it
gave
him
a
practical
opening
in
the
house
as
a
new
member
he
needed
a
field
diffidence
was
not
one
of
forster
weaknesses
his
practical
sense
and
his
personal
energy
soon
established
him
in
leadership
and
made
him
a
powerful
champion
not
so
much
for
ornament
as
for
work
with
such
a
manager
the
friends
of
the
union
in
england
began
to
take
heart
minister
adams
had
only
to
look
on
as
his
true
champions
the
came
into
action
and
even
the
private
secretary
caught
now
and
then
a
stray
gleam
of
encouragement
as
he
saw
the
ring
begin
to
clear
for
these
burly
yorkshiremen
to
stand
up
in
a
likely
to
be
as
brutal
as
ever
england
had
known
milnes
and
forster
were
not
exactly
but
bright
and
cobden
were
the
hardest
hitters
in
england
and
with
them
for
champions
the
minister
could
tackle
even
lord
palmerston
without
much
fear
of
foul
play
in
society
john
bright
and
richard
cobden
were
never
seen
and
even
in
parliament
they
had
no
large
following
they
were
classed
as
enemies
of
order
anarchists
and
anarchists
they
were
if
hatred
of
the
established
orders
made
them
so
about
them
was
no
sort
of
political
timidity
they
took
bluntly
the
side
of
the
union
against
palmerston
whom
they
hated
strangers
to
london
society
they
were
at
home
in
the
american
legation
delightful
talking
always
with
reckless
freedom
cobden
was
the
milder
and
more
persuasive
bright
was
the
more
dangerous
to
approach
but
the
private
secretary
delighted
in
both
and
nourished
an
ardent
wish
to
see
them
talk
the
same
language
to
lord
john
russell
from
the
gangway
of
the
house
with
four
such
allies
as
these
minister
adams
stood
no
longer
quite
helpless
for
the
second
time
the
british
ministry
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
itself
after
the
trent
affair
as
well
it
might
and
disposed
to
wait
before
moving
again
little
by
little
friends
gathered
about
the
legation
who
were
no
companions
the
old
exeter
hall
shaftesbury
clique
turned
out
to
be
an
annoying
and
troublesome
enemy
but
the
duke
of
argyll
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
friends
the
minister
found
both
politically
and
socially
and
the
duchess
was
as
true
as
her
mother
even
the
private
secretary
shared
faintly
in
the
social
profit
of
this
relation
and
never
forgot
dining
one
night
at
the
lodge
and
finding
himself
after
dinner
engaged
in
instructing
john
stuart
mill
about
the
peculiar
merits
of
an
american
protective
system
in
spite
of
all
the
probabilities
he
convinced
himself
that
it
was
not
the
duke
claret
which
led
him
to
this
singular
form
of
loquacity
he
insisted
that
it
was
the
fault
of
mill
himself
who
led
him
on
by
assenting
to
his
point
of
view
mill
took
no
apparent
pleasure
in
dispute
and
in
that
respect
the
duke
would
perhaps
have
done
better
but
the
secretary
had
to
admit
that
though
at
other
periods
of
life
he
was
sufficiently
and
even
amply
snubbed
by
englishmen
he
could
never
recall
a
single
occasion
during
this
trying
year
when
he
had
to
complain
of
rudeness
friendliness
he
found
here
and
there
but
chiefly
among
his
elders
not
among
fashionable
or
socially
powerful
people
either
men
or
women
although
not
even
this
rule
was
quite
exact
for
frederick
cavendish
kindness
and
intimate
relations
made
devonshire
house
almost
familiar
and
lyulph
stanley
ardent
americanism
created
a
certain
cordiality
with
the
stanleys
of
alderley
whose
house
was
one
of
the
most
frequented
in
london
lorne
too
the
future
argyll
was
always
a
friend
yet
the
regular
course
of
society
led
to
more
literary
intimacies
sir
charles
trevelyan
house
was
one
of
the
first
to
which
young
adams
was
asked
and
with
which
his
friendly
relations
never
ceased
for
near
half
a
century
and
then
only
when
death
stopped
them
sir
charles
and
lady
lyell
were
intimates
tom
hughes
came
into
close
alliance
by
the
time
society
began
to
reopen
its
doors
after
the
death
of
the
prince
consort
even
the
private
secretary
occasionally
saw
a
face
he
knew
although
he
made
no
more
effort
of
any
kind
but
silently
waited
the
end
whatever
might
be
the
advantages
of
social
relations
to
his
father
and
mother
to
him
the
whole
business
of
diplomacy
and
society
was
futile
he
meant
to
go
home
chapter
ix
foes
or
friends
of
the
year
henry
adams
could
never
think
without
a
shudder
the
war
alone
did
not
greatly
distress
him
already
in
his
short
life
he
was
used
to
seeing
people
wade
in
blood
and
he
could
plainly
discern
in
history
that
man
from
the
beginning
had
found
his
chief
amusement
in
bloodshed
but
the
ferocious
joy
of
destruction
at
its
best
requires
that
one
should
kill
what
one
hates
and
young
adams
neither
hated
nor
wanted
to
kill
his
friends
the
rebels
while
he
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
wipe
england
off
the
earth
never
could
any
good
come
from
that
besotted
race
he
was
feebly
trying
to
save
his
own
life
every
day
the
british
government
deliberately
crowded
him
one
step
further
into
the
grave
he
could
see
it
the
legation
knew
it
no
one
doubted
it
no
one
thought
of
questioning
it
the
trent
affair
showed
where
palmerston
and
russell
stood
the
escape
of
the
rebel
cruisers
from
liverpool
was
not
in
a
young
man
eyes
the
sign
of
hesitation
but
the
proof
of
their
fixed
intention
to
intervene
lord
russell
replies
to
adams
notes
were
discourteous
in
their
indifference
and
to
an
irritable
young
private
secretary
of
were
insolent
in
their
disregard
of
truth
whatever
forms
of
phrase
were
usual
in
public
to
modify
the
harshness
of
invective
in
private
no
political
opponent
in
england
and
few
political
friends
hesitated
to
say
brutally
of
lord
john
russell
that
he
lied
this
was
no
great
reproach
for
more
or
less
every
statesman
lied
but
the
intensity
of
the
private
secretary
rage
sprang
from
his
belief
that
russell
form
of
defence
covered
intent
to
kill
not
for
an
instant
did
the
legation
draw
a
free
breath
the
suspense
was
hideous
and
unendurable
the
minister
no
doubt
endured
it
but
he
had
support
and
consideration
while
his
son
had
nothing
to
think
about
but
his
friends
who
were
mostly
dying
under
mcclellan
in
the
swamps
about
richmond
or
his
enemies
who
were
exulting
in
pall
mall
he
bore
it
as
well
as
he
could
till
midsummer
but
when
the
story
of
the
second
bull
run
appeared
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
after
a
sleepless
night
walking
up
and
down
his
room
without
reflecting
that
his
father
was
beneath
him
he
announced
at
breakfast
his
intention
to
go
home
into
the
army
his
mother
seemed
to
be
less
impressed
by
the
announcement
than
by
the
walking
over
her
head
which
was
so
unlike
her
as
to
surprise
her
son
his
father
too
received
the
announcement
quietly
no
doubt
they
expected
it
and
had
taken
their
measures
in
advance
in
those
days
parents
got
used
to
all
sorts
of
announcements
from
their
children
adams
took
his
son
defection
as
quietly
as
he
took
bull
run
but
his
son
never
got
the
chance
to
go
he
found
obstacles
constantly
rising
in
his
path
the
remonstrances
of
his
brother
charles
who
was
himself
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
whose
opinion
had
always
the
greatest
weight
with
henry
had
much
to
do
with
delaying
action
but
he
felt
of
his
own
accord
that
if
he
deserted
his
post
in
london
and
found
the
capuan
comforts
he
expected
in
virginia
where
he
would
have
only
bullets
to
wound
him
he
would
never
forgive
himself
for
leaving
his
father
and
mother
alone
to
be
devoured
by
the
wild
beasts
of
the
british
amphitheatre
this
reflection
might
not
have
stopped
him
but
his
father
suggestion
was
decisive
the
minister
pointed
out
that
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
take
part
in
the
actual
campaign
and
that
long
before
next
spring
they
would
all
go
home
together
the
young
man
had
copied
too
many
affidavits
about
rebel
cruisers
to
miss
the
point
of
this
argument
so
he
sat
down
again
to
copy
some
more
consul
dudley
at
liverpool
provided
a
continuous
supply
properly
the
affidavits
were
no
business
of
the
private
secretary
but
practically
the
private
secretary
did
a
second
secretary
work
and
was
glad
to
do
it
if
it
would
save
seward
the
trouble
of
sending
more
secretaries
of
his
own
selection
to
help
the
minister
the
work
was
nothing
and
no
one
ever
complained
of
it
not
even
moran
the
secretary
of
legation
after
the
departure
of
charley
wilson
though
he
might
sit
up
all
night
to
copy
not
the
work
but
the
play
exhausted
the
effort
of
facing
a
hostile
society
was
bad
enough
but
that
of
facing
friends
was
worse
after
terrific
disasters
like
the
seven
days
before
richmond
and
the
second
bull
run
friends
needed
support
a
tone
of
bluff
would
have
been
fatal
for
the
average
mind
sees
quickest
through
a
bluff
nothing
answers
but
candor
yet
private
secretaries
never
feel
candid
however
much
they
feel
the
reverse
and
therefore
they
must
affect
candor
not
always
a
simple
act
when
one
is
exasperated
furious
bitter
and
choking
with
tears
over
the
blunders
and
incapacity
of
one
government
if
one
shed
tears
they
must
be
shed
on
one
pillow
least
of
all
must
one
throw
extra
strain
on
the
minister
who
had
all
he
could
carry
without
being
fretted
in
his
family
one
must
read
one
times
every
morning
over
one
muffin
without
reading
aloud
another
disastrous
federal
defeat
and
one
might
not
even
indulge
in
harmless
profanity
among
friends
required
much
more
effort
than
keeping
a
quiet
face
before
enemies
great
men
were
the
worst
blunderers
one
day
the
private
secretary
smiled
when
standing
with
the
crowd
in
the
while
the
endless
procession
made
bows
to
the
royal
family
at
hearing
behind
his
shoulder
one
cabinet
minister
remark
gaily
to
another
so
the
federals
have
got
another
licking
the
point
of
the
remark
was
its
truth
even
a
private
secretary
had
learned
to
control
his
tones
and
guard
his
features
and
betray
no
joy
over
the
lickings
of
an
enemy
in
the
enemy
presence
london
was
altogether
beside
itself
on
one
point
in
especial
it
created
a
nightmare
of
its
own
and
gave
it
the
shape
of
abraham
lincoln
behind
this
it
placed
another
demon
if
possible
more
devilish
and
called
it
seward
in
regard
to
these
two
men
english
society
seemed
demented
defence
was
useless
explanation
was
vain
one
could
only
let
the
passion
exhaust
itself
one
best
friends
were
as
unreasonable
as
enemies
for
the
belief
in
poor
lincoln
brutality
and
seward
ferocity
became
a
dogma
of
popular
faith
the
last
time
henry
adams
saw
thackeray
before
his
sudden
death
at
christmas
in
was
in
entering
the
house
of
sir
henry
holland
for
an
evening
reception
thackeray
was
pulling
on
his
coat
downstairs
laughing
because
in
his
usual
blind
way
he
had
stumbled
into
the
wrong
house
and
not
found
it
out
till
he
shook
hands
with
old
sir
henry
whom
he
knew
very
well
but
who
was
not
the
host
he
expected
then
his
tone
changed
as
he
spoke
of
his
and
adams
friend
frank
hampton
of
south
carolina
whom
he
had
loved
as
sally
baxter
and
painted
as
ethel
newcome
though
he
had
never
quite
forgiven
her
marriage
his
warmth
of
feeling
revived
when
he
heard
that
she
had
died
of
consumption
at
columbia
while
her
parents
and
sister
were
refused
permission
to
pass
through
the
lines
to
see
her
in
speaking
of
it
thackeray
voice
trembled
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
coarse
cruelty
of
lincoln
and
his
hirelings
was
notorious
he
never
doubted
that
the
federals
made
a
business
of
harrowing
the
tenderest
feelings
of
women
particularly
of
women
in
order
to
punish
their
opponents
on
quite
insufficient
evidence
he
burst
into
violent
reproach
had
adams
carried
in
his
pocket
the
proofs
that
the
reproach
was
unjust
he
would
have
gained
nothing
by
showing
them
at
that
moment
thackeray
and
all
london
society
with
him
needed
the
nervous
relief
of
expressing
emotion
for
if
lincoln
was
not
what
they
said
he
was
what
were
they
for
like
reason
the
members
of
the
legation
kept
silence
even
in
private
under
the
boorish
scotch
jibes
of
carlyle
if
carlyle
was
wrong
his
diatribes
would
give
his
true
measure
and
this
measure
would
be
a
low
one
for
carlyle
was
not
likely
to
be
more
sincere
or
more
sound
in
one
thought
than
in
another
the
proof
that
a
philosopher
does
not
know
what
he
is
talking
about
is
apt
to
sadden
his
followers
before
it
reacts
on
himself
demolition
of
one
idols
is
painful
and
carlyle
had
been
an
idol
doubts
cast
on
his
stature
spread
far
into
general
darkness
like
shadows
of
a
setting
sun
not
merely
the
idols
fell
but
also
the
habit
of
faith
if
carlyle
too
was
a
fraud
what
were
his
scholars
and
school
society
as
a
rule
was
civil
and
one
had
no
more
reason
to
complain
than
every
other
diplomatist
has
had
in
like
conditions
but
one
few
friends
in
society
were
mere
ornament
the
legation
could
not
dream
of
contesting
social
control
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
escape
mortification
and
by
this
time
their
relations
were
good
enough
to
save
the
minister
family
from
that
annoyance
now
and
then
the
fact
could
not
be
wholly
disguised
that
some
one
had
refused
to
meet
or
to
receive
the
minister
but
never
an
open
insult
or
any
expression
of
which
the
minister
had
to
take
notice
diplomacy
served
as
a
buffer
in
times
of
irritation
and
no
diplomat
who
knew
his
business
fretted
at
what
every
diplomat
and
none
more
commonly
than
the
english
had
to
expect
therefore
henry
adams
though
not
a
diplomat
and
wholly
unprotected
went
his
way
peacefully
enough
seeing
clearly
that
society
cared
little
to
make
his
acquaintance
but
seeing
also
no
reason
why
society
should
discover
charms
in
him
of
which
he
was
himself
unconscious
he
went
where
he
was
asked
he
was
always
courteously
received
he
was
on
the
whole
better
treated
than
at
washington
and
he
held
his
tongue
for
a
thousand
reasons
the
best
diplomatic
house
in
london
was
lord
palmerston
while
lord
john
russell
was
one
of
the
worst
of
neither
host
could
a
private
secretary
expect
to
know
anything
he
might
as
well
have
expected
to
know
the
grand
lama
personally
lord
palmerston
was
the
last
man
in
london
that
a
cautious
private
secretary
wanted
to
know
other
prime
ministers
may
perhaps
have
lived
who
inspired
among
diplomatists
as
much
distrust
as
palmerston
and
yet
between
palmerston
word
and
russell
word
one
hesitated
to
decide
and
gave
years
of
education
to
deciding
whether
either
could
be
trusted
or
how
far
the
queen
herself
in
her
famous
memorandum
of
august
gave
her
opinion
of
palmerston
in
words
that
differed
little
from
words
used
by
lord
john
russell
and
both
the
queen
and
russell
said
in
substance
only
what
cobden
and
bright
said
in
private
every
diplomatist
agreed
with
them
yet
the
diplomatic
standard
of
trust
seemed
to
be
other
than
the
parliamentarian
no
professional
diplomatists
worried
about
falsehoods
words
were
with
them
forms
of
expression
which
varied
with
individuals
but
falsehood
was
more
or
less
necessary
to
all
the
worst
liars
were
the
candid
what
diplomatists
wanted
to
know
was
the
motive
that
lay
beyond
the
expression
in
the
case
of
palmerston
they
were
unanimous
in
warning
new
colleagues
that
they
might
expect
to
be
sacrificed
by
him
to
any
momentary
personal
object
every
new
minister
or
ambassador
at
the
court
of
james
received
this
preliminary
lesson
that
he
must
if
possible
keep
out
of
palmerston
reach
the
rule
was
not
secret
or
merely
diplomatic
the
queen
herself
had
emphatically
expressed
the
same
opinion
officially
if
palmerston
had
an
object
to
gain
he
would
go
down
to
the
house
of
commons
and
betray
or
misrepresent
a
foreign
minister
without
concern
for
his
victim
no
one
got
back
on
him
with
a
blow
equally
mischievous
not
even
the
queen
for
as
old
baron
brunnow
described
him
une
peau
de
rhinocere
having
gained
his
point
he
laughed
and
his
public
laughed
with
him
for
the
usual
british
or
american
public
likes
to
be
amused
and
thought
it
very
amusing
to
see
these
beribboned
and
bestarred
foreigners
caught
and
tossed
and
gored
on
the
horns
of
this
jovial
slashing
british
bull
diplomatists
have
no
right
to
complain
of
mere
lies
it
is
their
own
fault
if
educated
as
they
are
the
lies
deceive
them
but
they
complain
bitterly
of
traps
palmerston
was
believed
to
lay
traps
he
was
the
enfant
terrible
of
the
british
government
on
the
other
hand
lady
palmerston
was
believed
to
be
good
and
loyal
all
the
diplomats
and
their
wives
seemed
to
think
so
and
took
their
troubles
to
her
believing
that
she
would
try
to
help
them
for
this
reason
among
others
her
evenings
at
home
saturday
reviews
they
were
called
had
great
vogue
an
ignorant
young
american
could
not
be
expected
to
explain
it
cambridge
house
was
no
better
for
entertaining
than
a
score
of
others
lady
palmerston
was
no
longer
young
or
handsome
and
could
hardly
at
any
age
have
been
vivacious
the
people
one
met
there
were
never
smart
and
seldom
young
they
were
largely
diplomatic
and
diplomats
are
commonly
dull
they
were
largely
political
and
politicians
rarely
decorate
or
beautify
an
evening
party
they
were
sprinkled
with
literary
people
who
are
notoriously
unfashionable
the
women
were
of
course
and
the
men
looked
mostly
bored
or
out
of
place
yet
beyond
a
doubt
cambridge
house
was
the
best
and
perhaps
the
only
political
house
in
london
and
its
success
was
due
to
lady
palmerston
who
never
seemed
to
make
an
effort
beyond
a
friendly
recognition
as
a
lesson
in
social
education
cambridge
house
gave
much
subject
for
thought
first
or
last
one
was
to
know
dozens
of
statesmen
more
powerful
and
more
agreeable
than
lord
palmerston
dozens
of
ladies
more
beautiful
and
more
painstaking
than
lady
palmerston
but
no
political
house
so
successful
as
cambridge
house
the
world
never
explains
such
riddles
the
foreigners
said
only
that
lady
palmerston
was
sympathique
the
small
fry
of
the
legations
were
admitted
there
or
tolerated
without
a
further
effort
to
recognize
their
existence
but
they
were
pleased
because
rarely
tolerated
anywhere
else
and
there
they
could
at
least
stand
in
a
corner
and
look
at
a
bishop
or
even
a
duke
this
was
the
social
diversion
of
young
adams
no
one
knew
him
not
even
the
lackeys
the
last
saturday
evening
he
ever
attended
he
gave
his
name
as
usual
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
was
rather
disturbed
to
hear
it
shouted
up
as
handrew
hadams
he
tried
to
correct
it
and
the
footman
shouted
more
loudly
hanthony
hadams
with
some
temper
he
repeated
the
correction
and
was
finally
announced
as
halexander
hadams
and
under
this
name
made
his
bow
for
the
last
time
to
lord
palmerston
who
certainly
knew
no
better
far
down
the
staircase
one
heard
lord
palmerston
laugh
as
he
stood
at
the
door
receiving
his
guests
talking
probably
to
one
of
his
henchmen
delane
borthwick
or
hayward
who
were
sure
to
be
near
the
laugh
was
singular
mechanical
wooden
and
did
not
seem
to
disturb
his
features
ha
ha
ha
each
was
a
slow
deliberate
ejaculation
and
all
were
in
the
same
tone
as
though
he
meant
to
say
yes
yes
yes
by
way
of
assurance
it
was
a
laugh
of
and
the
congress
of
vienna
adams
would
have
much
liked
to
stop
a
moment
and
ask
whether
william
pitt
and
the
duke
of
wellington
had
laughed
so
but
young
men
attached
to
foreign
ministers
asked
no
questions
at
all
of
palmerston
and
their
chiefs
asked
as
few
as
possible
one
made
the
usual
bow
and
received
the
usual
glance
of
civility
then
passed
on
to
lady
palmerston
who
was
always
kind
in
manner
but
who
wasted
no
remarks
and
so
to
lady
jocelyn
with
her
daughter
who
commonly
had
something
friendly
to
say
then
went
through
the
diplomatic
corps
brunnow
musurus
azeglio
apponyi
van
de
weyer
bille
tricoupi
and
the
rest
finally
dropping
into
the
hands
of
some
literary
accident
as
strange
there
as
one
self
the
routine
varied
little
there
was
no
attempt
at
entertainment
except
for
the
desperate
isolation
of
these
two
first
seasons
even
secretaries
would
have
found
the
effort
almost
as
mechanical
as
a
levee
at
james
palace
lord
palmerston
was
not
foreign
secretary
he
was
prime
minister
but
he
loved
foreign
affairs
and
could
no
more
resist
scoring
a
point
in
diplomacy
than
in
whist
ministers
of
foreign
powers
knowing
his
habits
tried
to
hold
him
at
and
to
do
this
were
obliged
to
court
the
actual
foreign
secretary
lord
john
russell
who
on
july
was
called
up
to
the
house
of
lords
as
an
earl
by
some
process
of
personal
affiliation
minister
adams
succeeded
in
persuading
himself
that
he
could
trust
lord
russell
more
safely
than
lord
palmerston
his
son
being
young
and
in
temper
thought
there
was
nothing
to
choose
englishmen
saw
little
difference
between
them
and
americans
were
bound
to
follow
english
experience
in
english
character
minister
adams
had
much
to
learn
although
with
him
as
well
as
with
his
son
the
months
of
education
began
to
count
as
aeons
just
as
brunnow
predicted
lord
palmerston
made
his
rush
at
last
as
unexpected
as
always
and
more
furiously
than
though
still
a
private
secretary
of
only
a
man
who
had
been
young
with
the
battle
of
trafalgar
could
be
fresh
and
jaunty
to
that
point
but
minister
adams
was
not
in
a
position
to
sympathize
with
octogenarian
youth
and
found
himself
in
a
danger
as
critical
as
that
of
his
numerous
predecessors
it
was
late
one
after
noon
in
june
as
the
private
secretary
returned
with
the
minister
from
some
social
function
that
he
saw
his
father
pick
up
a
note
from
his
desk
and
read
it
in
silence
then
he
said
curtly
palmerston
wants
a
quarrel
this
was
the
point
of
the
incident
as
he
felt
it
palmerston
wanted
a
quarrel
he
must
not
be
gratified
he
must
be
stopped
the
matter
of
quarrel
was
general
butler
famous
at
new
orleans
but
the
motive
was
the
belief
in
president
lincoln
brutality
that
had
taken
such
deep
root
in
the
british
mind
knowing
palmerston
habits
the
minister
took
for
granted
that
he
meant
to
score
a
diplomatic
point
by
producing
this
note
in
the
house
of
commons
if
he
did
this
at
once
the
minister
was
lost
the
quarrel
was
made
and
one
new
victim
to
palmerston
passion
for
popularity
was
sacrificed
the
moment
was
nervous
as
far
as
the
private
secretary
knew
quite
the
most
critical
moment
in
the
records
of
american
diplomacy
but
the
story
belongs
to
history
not
to
education
and
can
be
read
there
by
any
one
who
cares
to
read
it
as
a
part
of
henry
adams
education
it
had
a
value
distinct
from
history
that
his
father
succeeded
in
muzzling
palmerston
without
a
public
scandal
was
well
enough
for
the
minister
but
was
not
enough
for
a
private
secretary
who
liked
going
to
cambridge
house
and
was
puzzled
to
reconcile
contradictions
that
palmerston
had
wanted
a
quarrel
was
obvious
why
then
did
he
submit
so
tamely
to
being
made
the
victim
of
the
quarrel
the
correspondence
that
followed
his
note
was
conducted
feebly
on
his
side
and
he
allowed
the
united
states
minister
to
close
it
by
a
refusal
to
receive
further
communications
from
him
except
through
lord
russell
the
step
was
excessively
strong
for
it
broke
off
private
relations
as
well
as
public
and
cost
even
the
private
secretary
his
invitations
to
cambridge
house
lady
palmerston
tried
her
best
but
the
two
ladies
found
no
resource
except
tears
they
had
to
do
with
american
minister
perplexed
in
the
extreme
not
that
adams
lost
his
temper
for
he
never
felt
such
a
weight
of
responsibility
and
was
never
more
cool
but
he
could
conceive
no
other
way
of
protecting
his
government
not
to
speak
of
himself
than
to
force
lord
russell
to
interpose
he
believed
that
palmerston
submission
and
silence
were
due
to
russell
perhaps
he
was
right
at
the
time
his
son
had
no
doubt
of
it
though
afterwards
he
felt
less
sure
palmerston
wanted
a
quarrel
the
motive
seemed
evident
yet
when
the
quarrel
was
made
he
backed
out
of
it
for
some
reason
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
want
it
at
least
not
then
he
never
showed
resentment
against
adams
at
the
time
or
afterwards
he
never
began
another
quarrel
incredible
as
it
seemed
he
behaved
like
a
gentleman
who
felt
himself
in
the
wrong
possibly
this
change
may
have
been
due
to
lord
russell
remonstrances
but
the
private
secretary
would
have
felt
his
education
in
politics
more
complete
had
he
ever
finally
made
up
his
mind
whether
palmerston
was
more
angry
with
general
butler
or
more
annoyed
at
himself
for
committing
what
was
in
both
cases
an
unpardonable
betise
at
the
time
the
question
was
hardly
raised
for
no
one
doubted
palmerston
attitude
or
his
plans
the
season
was
near
its
end
and
cambridge
house
was
soon
closed
the
legation
had
troubles
enough
without
caring
to
publish
more
the
tide
of
english
feeling
ran
so
violently
against
it
that
one
could
only
wait
to
see
whether
general
mcclellan
would
bring
it
relief
the
year
was
a
dark
spot
in
henry
adams
life
and
the
education
it
gave
was
mostly
one
that
he
gladly
forgot
as
far
as
he
was
aware
he
made
no
friends
he
could
hardly
make
enemies
yet
towards
the
close
of
the
year
he
was
flattered
by
an
invitation
from
monckton
milnes
to
fryston
and
it
was
one
of
many
acts
of
charity
towards
the
young
that
gave
milnes
immortality
milnes
made
it
his
business
to
be
kind
other
people
criticised
him
for
his
manner
of
doing
it
but
never
imitated
him
naturally
a
dispirited
disheartened
private
secretary
was
exceedingly
grateful
and
never
forgot
the
kindness
but
it
was
chiefly
as
education
that
this
first
country
visit
had
value
commonly
country
visits
are
much
alike
but
monckton
milnes
was
never
like
anybody
and
his
country
parties
served
his
purpose
of
mixing
strange
elements
fryston
was
one
of
a
class
of
houses
that
no
one
sought
for
its
natural
beauties
and
the
winter
mists
of
yorkshire
were
rather
more
evident
for
the
absence
of
the
hostess
on
account
of
them
so
that
the
singular
guests
whom
milnes
collected
to
enliven
his
december
had
nothing
to
do
but
astonish
each
other
if
anything
could
astonish
such
men
of
the
five
adams
alone
was
tame
he
alone
added
nothing
to
the
wit
or
humor
except
as
a
listener
but
they
needed
a
listener
and
he
was
useful
of
the
remaining
four
milnes
was
the
oldest
and
perhaps
the
sanest
in
spite
of
his
superficial
eccentricities
for
yorkshire
sanity
was
true
to
a
standard
of
its
own
if
not
to
other
conventions
yet
even
milnes
startled
a
young
american
whose
boston
and
washington
mind
was
still
fresh
he
would
not
have
been
startled
by
the
yorkshireman
of
whom
he
had
read
in
books
but
milnes
required
a
knowledge
of
society
and
literature
that
only
himself
possessed
if
one
were
to
try
to
keep
pace
with
him
he
had
sought
contact
with
everybody
and
everything
that
europe
could
offer
he
knew
it
all
from
several
points
of
view
and
chiefly
as
humorous
the
second
of
the
party
was
also
of
a
certain
age
a
quiet
singularly
agreeable
gentleman
of
the
literary
class
when
milnes
showed
adams
to
his
room
to
dress
for
dinner
he
stayed
a
moment
to
say
a
word
about
this
guest
whom
he
called
stirling
of
keir
his
sketch
closed
with
the
hint
that
stirling
was
violent
only
on
one
point
hatred
of
napoleon
iii
on
that
point
adams
was
himself
sensitive
which
led
him
to
wonder
how
bad
the
scotch
gentleman
might
be
the
third
was
a
man
of
thirty
or
thereabouts
whom
adams
had
already
met
at
lady
palmerston
carrying
his
arm
in
a
sling
his
figure
and
bearing
were
sympathetic
almost
pathetic
with
a
certain
grave
and
gentle
charm
a
pleasant
smile
and
an
interesting
story
he
was
lawrence
oliphant
just
from
japan
where
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
fanatics
attack
on
the
british
legation
he
seemed
exceptionally
sane
and
peculiarly
suited
for
country
houses
where
every
man
would
enjoy
his
company
and
every
woman
would
adore
him
he
had
not
then
published
piccadilly
perhaps
he
was
writing
it
while
like
all
the
young
men
about
the
foreign
office
he
contributed
to
the
owl
the
fourth
was
a
boy
or
had
the
look
of
one
though
in
fact
a
year
older
than
adams
himself
he
resembled
in
action
and
in
this
trait
was
remotely
followed
a
generation
later
by
another
famous
young
man
robert
louis
stevenson
a
tropical
bird
with
rapid
utterance
and
screams
of
humor
quite
unlike
any
english
lark
or
nightingale
one
could
hardly
call
him
a
crimson
macaw
among
owls
and
yet
no
ordinary
contrast
availed
milnes
introduced
him
as
algernon
swinburne
the
name
suggested
nothing
milnes
was
always
unearthing
new
coins
and
trying
to
give
them
currency
he
had
unearthed
henry
adams
who
knew
himself
to
be
worthless
and
not
current
when
milnes
lingered
a
moment
in
adams
room
to
add
that
swinburne
had
written
some
poetry
not
yet
published
of
really
extraordinary
merit
adams
only
wondered
what
more
milnes
would
discover
and
whether
by
chance
he
could
discover
merit
in
a
private
secretary
he
was
capable
of
it
in
due
course
this
party
of
five
men
sat
down
to
dinner
with
the
usual
club
manners
of
ladyless
easy
and
formal
at
the
same
time
conversation
ran
first
to
oliphant
who
told
his
dramatic
story
simply
and
from
him
the
talk
drifted
off
into
other
channels
until
milnes
thought
it
time
to
bring
swinburne
out
then
at
last
if
never
before
adams
acquired
education
what
he
had
sought
so
long
he
found
but
he
was
none
the
wiser
only
the
more
astonished
for
once
too
he
felt
at
ease
for
the
others
were
no
less
astonished
than
himself
and
their
astonishment
grew
apace
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
swinburne
figured
alone
the
end
of
dinner
made
the
monologue
only
freer
for
in
even
when
ladies
were
not
in
the
house
smoking
was
forbidden
and
guests
usually
smoked
in
the
stables
or
the
kitchen
but
monckton
milnes
was
a
licensed
libertine
who
let
his
guests
smoke
in
adams
bedroom
since
adams
was
an
barbarian
ignorant
of
manners
and
there
after
dinner
all
sat
or
lay
till
far
into
the
night
listening
to
the
rush
of
swinburne
talk
in
a
long
experience
before
or
after
no
one
ever
approached
it
yet
one
had
heard
accounts
of
the
best
talking
of
the
time
and
read
accounts
of
talkers
in
all
time
among
the
rest
of
voltaire
who
seemed
to
approach
nearest
the
pattern
that
swinburne
was
altogether
new
to
the
three
types
of
before
him
that
he
seemed
to
them
quite
original
wildly
eccentric
astonishingly
gifted
and
convulsingly
droll
adams
could
see
but
what
more
he
was
even
milnes
hardly
dared
say
they
could
not
believe
his
incredible
memory
and
knowledge
of
literature
classic
mediaeval
and
modern
his
faculty
of
reciting
a
play
of
sophocles
or
a
play
of
shakespeare
forward
or
backward
from
end
to
beginning
or
dante
or
villon
or
victor
hugo
they
knew
not
what
to
make
of
his
rhetorical
recitation
of
his
own
unpublished
ballads
faustine
the
four
boards
of
the
coffin
lid
the
ballad
of
burdens
which
he
declaimed
as
though
they
were
books
of
the
iliad
it
was
singular
that
his
most
appreciative
listener
should
have
been
the
author
only
of
pretty
verses
like
we
wandered
by
the
and
she
seemed
to
those
that
saw
them
meet
and
who
never
cared
to
write
in
any
other
tone
but
milnes
took
everything
into
his
sympathies
including
americans
like
young
adams
whose
standards
were
stiffest
of
all
while
swinburne
though
millions
of
ages
far
from
them
united
them
by
his
humor
even
more
than
by
his
poetry
the
story
of
his
first
day
as
a
member
of
professor
stubbs
household
was
professionally
clever
farce
if
not
high
comedy
in
a
young
man
who
could
write
a
greek
ode
or
a
provençal
chanson
as
easily
as
an
english
quatrain
late
at
night
when
the
symposium
broke
up
stirling
of
keir
wanted
to
take
with
him
to
his
chamber
a
copy
of
queen
rosamund
the
only
volume
swinburne
had
then
published
which
was
on
the
library
table
and
adams
offered
to
light
him
down
with
his
solitary
bedroom
candle
all
the
way
stirling
was
ejaculating
explosions
of
wonder
until
at
length
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
at
the
climax
of
his
imagination
he
paused
and
burst
out
he
a
cross
between
the
devil
and
the
duke
of
argyll
to
appreciate
the
full
merit
of
this
description
a
judicious
critic
should
have
known
both
and
henry
adams
knew
only
one
at
least
in
person
but
he
understood
that
to
a
scotchman
the
likeness
meant
something
quite
portentous
beyond
english
experience
supernatural
and
what
the
french
call
moyenageux
or
mediaeval
with
a
grotesque
turn
that
stirling
as
well
as
milnes
should
regard
swinburne
as
a
prodigy
greatly
comforted
adams
who
lost
his
balance
of
mind
at
first
in
trying
to
imagine
that
swinburne
was
a
natural
product
of
oxford
as
muffins
and
of
london
at
once
the
cause
and
effect
of
dyspepsia
the
idea
that
one
has
actually
met
a
real
genius
dawns
slowly
on
a
boston
mind
but
it
made
entry
at
last
then
came
the
sad
reaction
not
from
swinburne
whose
genius
never
was
in
doubt
but
from
the
boston
mind
which
in
its
uttermost
flights
was
never
moyenageux
one
felt
the
horror
of
longfellow
and
emerson
the
doubts
of
lowell
and
the
humor
of
holmes
at
the
wild
of
swinburne
talk
what
could
a
shy
young
private
secretary
do
about
it
perhaps
in
his
good
nature
milnes
thought
that
swinburne
might
find
a
friend
in
stirling
or
oliphant
but
he
could
hardly
have
fancied
henry
adams
rousing
in
him
even
an
interest
adams
could
no
more
interest
algernon
swinburne
than
he
could
interest
encke
comet
to
swinburne
he
could
be
no
more
than
a
worm
the
quality
of
genius
was
an
education
almost
ultimate
for
one
touched
there
the
limits
of
the
human
mind
on
that
side
but
one
could
only
receive
one
had
nothing
to
give
nothing
even
to
offer
swinburne
tested
him
then
and
there
by
one
of
his
favorite
tests
victor
hugo
for
to
him
the
test
of
victor
hugo
was
the
surest
and
quickest
of
standards
french
poetry
is
at
best
a
severe
exercise
for
foreigners
it
requires
extraordinary
knowledge
of
the
language
and
rare
refinement
of
ear
to
appreciate
even
the
recitation
of
french
verse
but
unless
a
poet
has
both
he
lacks
something
of
poetry
adams
had
neither
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
never
listened
to
a
french
recitation
with
pleasure
or
felt
a
sense
of
majesty
in
french
verse
but
he
did
not
care
to
proclaim
his
weakness
and
he
tried
to
evade
swinburne
vehement
insistence
by
parading
an
affection
for
alfred
de
musset
swinburne
would
have
none
of
it
de
musset
was
unequal
he
did
not
sustain
himself
on
the
wing
adams
would
have
given
a
world
or
two
if
he
owned
one
to
sustain
himself
on
the
wing
like
de
musset
or
even
like
hugo
but
his
education
as
well
as
his
ear
was
at
fault
and
he
succumbed
swinburne
tried
him
again
on
walter
savage
landor
in
truth
the
test
was
the
same
for
swinburne
admired
in
landor
english
the
qualities
that
he
felt
in
hugo
french
and
adams
failure
was
equally
gross
for
when
forced
to
despair
he
had
to
admit
that
both
hugo
and
landor
bored
him
nothing
more
was
needed
one
who
could
feel
neither
hugo
nor
landor
was
lost
the
sentence
was
just
and
adams
never
appealed
from
it
he
knew
his
inferiority
in
taste
as
he
might
know
it
in
smell
keenly
mortified
by
the
dullness
of
his
senses
and
instincts
he
knew
he
was
no
companion
for
swinburne
probably
he
could
be
only
an
annoyance
no
number
of
centuries
could
ever
educate
him
to
swinburne
level
even
in
technical
appreciation
yet
he
often
wondered
whether
there
was
nothing
he
had
to
offer
that
was
worth
the
poet
acceptance
certainly
such
mild
homage
as
the
american
insect
would
have
been
only
too
happy
to
bring
had
he
known
how
was
hardly
worth
the
acceptance
of
any
one
only
in
france
is
the
attitude
of
prayer
possible
in
england
it
became
absurd
even
monckton
milnes
who
felt
the
splendors
of
hugo
and
landor
was
almost
as
helpless
as
an
american
private
secretary
in
personal
contact
with
them
ten
years
afterwards
adams
met
him
at
the
geneva
conference
fresh
from
paris
bubbling
with
delight
at
a
call
he
had
made
on
hugo
i
was
shown
into
a
large
room
he
said
with
women
and
men
seated
in
chairs
against
the
walls
and
hugo
at
one
end
throned
no
one
spoke
at
last
hugo
raised
his
voice
solemnly
and
uttered
the
words
a
moi
je
crois
en
dieu
silence
followed
then
a
woman
responded
as
if
in
deep
meditation
sublime
un
dieu
qui
croit
en
dieu
with
the
best
of
will
one
could
not
do
this
in
london
the
actors
had
not
the
instinct
of
the
drama
and
yet
even
a
private
secretary
was
not
wholly
wanting
in
instinct
as
soon
as
he
reached
town
he
hurried
to
pickering
for
a
copy
of
queen
rosamund
and
at
that
time
if
swinburne
was
not
joking
pickering
had
sold
seven
copies
when
the
poems
and
ballads
came
out
and
met
their
great
success
and
scandal
he
sought
one
of
the
first
copies
from
moxon
if
he
had
sinned
and
doubted
at
all
he
wholly
repented
and
did
penance
before
atalanta
in
calydon
and
would
have
offered
swinburne
a
solemn
worship
as
milnes
female
offered
hugo
if
it
would
have
pleased
the
poet
unfortunately
it
was
worthless
the
three
young
men
returned
to
london
and
each
went
his
own
way
adams
interest
in
making
friends
was
something
desperate
but
the
london
season
milnes
used
to
say
is
a
season
for
making
acquaintances
and
losing
friends
there
was
no
intimate
life
of
swinburne
he
saw
no
more
till
monckton
milnes
summoned
his
whole
array
of
frystonians
to
support
him
in
presiding
at
the
dinner
of
the
authors
fund
when
adams
found
himself
seated
next
to
swinburne
famous
then
but
no
nearer
they
never
met
again
oliphant
he
met
oftener
all
the
world
knew
and
loved
him
but
he
too
disappeared
in
the
way
that
all
the
world
knows
stirling
of
keir
after
one
or
two
efforts
passed
also
from
adams
vision
into
sir
william
the
only
record
of
his
wonderful
visit
to
fryston
may
perhaps
exist
still
in
the
registers
of
the
james
club
for
immediately
afterwards
milnes
proposed
henry
adams
for
membership
and
unless
his
memory
erred
the
nomination
was
seconded
by
tricoupi
and
endorsed
by
laurence
oliphant
and
evelyn
ashley
the
list
was
a
little
singular
for
variety
but
on
the
whole
it
suggested
that
the
private
secretary
was
getting
on
chapter
x
political
morality
on
moran
promotion
to
be
secretary
seward
inquired
whether
minister
adams
would
like
the
place
of
assistant
secretary
for
his
son
it
was
the
first
and
last
office
ever
offered
him
if
indeed
he
could
claim
what
was
offered
in
fact
to
his
father
to
them
both
the
change
seemed
useless
any
young
man
could
make
some
sort
of
assistant
secretary
only
one
just
at
that
moment
could
make
an
assistant
son
more
than
half
his
duties
were
domestic
they
sometimes
required
long
absences
they
always
required
independence
of
the
government
service
his
position
was
abnormal
the
british
government
by
courtesy
allowed
the
son
to
go
to
court
as
attache
though
he
was
never
attached
and
after
five
or
six
years
toleration
the
decision
was
declared
irregular
in
the
legation
as
private
secretary
he
was
liable
to
do
secretary
work
in
society
when
official
he
was
attached
to
the
minister
when
unofficial
he
was
a
young
man
without
any
position
at
all
as
the
years
went
on
he
began
to
find
advantages
in
having
no
position
at
all
except
that
of
young
man
gradually
he
aspired
to
become
a
gentleman
just
a
member
of
society
like
the
rest
the
position
was
irregular
at
that
time
many
positions
were
irregular
yet
it
lent
itself
to
a
sort
of
irregular
education
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
sort
of
education
the
young
man
was
ever
to
get
such
as
it
was
few
young
men
had
more
the
spring
and
summer
of
saw
a
great
change
in
secretary
seward
management
of
foreign
affairs
under
the
stimulus
of
danger
he
too
got
education
he
felt
at
last
that
his
official
representatives
abroad
needed
support
officially
he
could
give
them
nothing
but
despatches
which
were
of
no
great
value
to
any
one
and
at
best
the
mere
weight
of
an
office
had
little
to
do
with
the
public
governments
were
made
to
deal
with
governments
not
with
private
individuals
or
with
the
opinions
of
foreign
society
in
order
to
affect
european
opinion
the
weight
of
american
opinion
had
to
be
brought
to
bear
personally
and
had
to
be
backed
by
the
weight
of
american
interests
seward
set
vigorously
to
work
and
sent
over
every
important
american
on
whom
he
could
lay
his
hands
all
came
to
the
legation
more
or
less
intimately
and
henry
adams
had
a
chance
to
see
them
all
bankers
or
bishops
who
did
their
work
quietly
and
well
though
to
the
outsider
the
work
seemed
wasted
and
the
influential
classes
more
indurated
with
prejudice
than
ever
the
waste
was
only
apparent
the
work
all
told
in
the
end
and
meanwhile
it
helped
education
two
or
three
of
these
gentlemen
were
sent
over
to
aid
the
minister
and
to
cooperate
with
him
the
most
interesting
of
these
was
thurlow
weed
who
came
to
do
what
the
private
secretary
himself
had
attempted
two
years
before
with
boyish
ignorance
of
his
own
powers
weed
took
charge
of
the
press
and
began
to
the
amused
astonishment
of
the
secretaries
by
making
what
the
legation
had
learned
to
accept
as
the
invariable
mistake
of
every
amateur
diplomat
he
wrote
letters
to
the
london
times
mistake
or
not
weed
soon
got
into
his
hands
the
threads
of
management
and
did
quietly
and
smoothly
all
that
was
to
be
done
with
his
work
the
private
secretary
had
no
connection
it
was
he
that
interested
thurlow
weed
was
a
complete
american
education
in
himself
his
mind
was
naturally
strong
and
beautifully
balanced
his
temper
never
seemed
ruffled
his
manners
were
carefully
perfect
in
the
style
of
benevolent
simplicity
the
tradition
of
benjamin
franklin
he
was
the
model
of
political
management
and
patient
address
but
the
trait
that
excited
enthusiasm
in
a
private
secretary
was
his
faculty
of
irresistibly
conquering
confidence
of
all
flowers
in
the
garden
of
education
confidence
was
becoming
the
rarest
but
before
weed
went
away
young
adams
followed
him
about
not
only
obediently
for
obedience
had
long
since
become
a
blind
instinct
but
rather
with
sympathy
and
affection
much
like
a
little
dog
the
sympathy
was
not
due
only
to
weed
skill
of
management
although
adams
never
met
another
such
master
or
any
one
who
approached
him
nor
was
the
confidence
due
to
any
display
of
professions
either
moral
or
social
by
weed
the
trait
that
astounded
and
confounded
cynicism
was
his
apparent
unselfishness
never
in
any
man
who
wielded
such
power
did
adams
meet
anything
like
it
the
effect
of
power
and
publicity
on
all
men
is
the
aggravation
of
self
a
sort
of
tumor
that
ends
by
killing
the
victim
sympathies
a
diseased
appetite
like
a
passion
for
drink
or
perverted
tastes
one
can
scarcely
use
expressions
too
strong
to
describe
the
violence
of
egotism
it
stimulates
and
thurlow
weed
was
one
of
the
exceptions
a
rare
immune
he
thought
apparently
not
of
himself
but
of
the
person
he
was
talking
with
he
held
himself
naturally
in
the
background
he
was
not
jealous
he
grasped
power
but
not
office
he
distributed
offices
by
handfuls
without
caring
to
take
them
he
had
the
instinct
of
empire
he
gave
but
he
did
not
receive
this
rare
superiority
to
the
politicians
he
controlled
a
trait
that
private
secretaries
never
met
in
the
politicians
themselves
excited
adams
wonder
and
curiosity
but
when
he
tried
to
get
behind
it
and
to
educate
himself
from
the
stores
of
weed
experience
he
found
the
study
still
more
fascinating
management
was
an
instinct
with
weed
an
object
to
be
pursued
for
its
own
sake
as
one
plays
cards
but
he
appeared
to
play
with
men
as
though
they
were
only
cards
he
seemed
incapable
of
feeling
himself
one
of
them
he
took
them
and
played
them
for
their
but
once
when
he
had
told
with
his
usual
humor
some
stories
of
his
political
experience
which
were
strong
even
for
the
albany
lobby
the
private
secretary
made
bold
to
ask
him
outright
then
weed
do
you
think
that
no
politician
can
be
trusted
weed
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
said
in
his
mild
manner
i
never
advise
a
young
man
to
begin
by
thinking
so
this
lesson
at
the
time
translated
itself
to
adams
in
a
moral
sense
as
though
weed
had
said
youth
needs
illusions
as
he
grew
older
he
rather
thought
that
weed
looked
on
it
as
a
question
of
how
the
game
should
be
played
young
men
most
needed
experience
they
could
not
play
well
if
they
trusted
to
a
general
rule
every
card
had
a
relative
value
principles
had
better
be
left
aside
values
were
enough
adams
knew
that
he
could
never
learn
to
play
politics
in
so
masterly
a
fashion
as
this
his
education
and
his
nervous
system
equally
forbade
it
although
he
admired
all
the
more
the
impersonal
faculty
of
the
political
master
who
could
thus
efface
himself
and
his
temper
in
the
game
he
noticed
that
most
of
the
greatest
politicians
in
history
had
seemed
to
regard
men
as
counters
the
lesson
was
the
more
interesting
because
another
famous
new
yorker
came
over
at
the
same
time
who
liked
to
discuss
the
same
problem
secretary
seward
sent
william
evarts
to
london
as
law
counsel
and
henry
began
an
acquaintance
with
evarts
that
soon
became
intimate
evarts
was
as
individual
as
weed
was
impersonal
like
most
men
he
cared
little
for
the
game
or
how
it
was
played
and
much
for
the
stakes
but
he
played
it
in
a
large
and
liberal
way
like
daniel
webster
a
great
advocate
employed
in
politics
evarts
was
also
an
economist
of
morals
but
with
him
the
question
was
rather
how
much
morality
one
could
afford
the
world
can
absorb
only
doses
of
truth
he
said
too
much
would
kill
it
one
sought
education
in
order
to
adjust
the
dose
the
teachings
of
weed
and
evarts
were
practical
and
the
private
secretary
life
turned
on
their
value
england
power
of
absorbing
truth
was
small
englishmen
such
as
palmerston
russell
bethell
and
the
society
represented
by
the
times
and
morning
post
as
well
as
the
tories
represented
by
disraeli
lord
robert
cecil
and
the
standard
offered
a
study
in
education
that
sickened
a
young
student
with
anxiety
he
had
begun
contrary
to
weed
advice
by
taking
their
bad
faith
for
granted
was
he
wrong
to
settle
this
point
became
the
main
object
of
the
diplomatic
education
so
laboriously
pursued
at
a
cost
already
stupendous
and
promising
to
become
ruinous
life
changed
front
according
as
one
thought
one
self
dealing
with
honest
men
or
with
rogues
thus
far
the
private
secretary
felt
officially
sure
of
dishonesty
the
reasons
that
satisfied
him
had
not
altogether
satisfied
his
father
and
of
course
his
father
doubts
gravely
shook
his
own
convictions
but
in
practice
if
only
for
safety
the
legation
put
little
or
no
confidence
in
ministers
and
there
the
private
diplomatic
education
began
the
recognition
of
belligerency
the
management
of
the
declaration
of
paris
the
trent
affair
all
strengthened
the
belief
that
lord
russell
had
started
in
may
with
the
assumption
that
the
confederacy
was
established
every
step
he
had
taken
proved
his
persistence
in
the
same
idea
he
never
would
consent
to
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
recognition
and
he
was
waiting
only
for
the
proper
moment
to
interpose
all
these
points
seemed
so
fixed
so
that
no
one
in
the
legation
would
have
doubted
or
even
discussed
them
except
that
lord
russell
obstinately
denied
the
whole
charge
and
persisted
in
assuring
minister
adams
of
his
honest
and
impartial
neutrality
with
the
insolence
of
youth
and
zeal
henry
adams
jumped
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
earl
russell
like
other
statesmen
lied
and
although
the
minister
thought
differently
he
had
to
act
as
though
russell
were
false
month
by
month
the
demonstration
followed
its
mathematical
stages
one
of
the
most
perfect
educational
courses
in
politics
and
diplomacy
that
a
young
man
ever
had
a
chance
to
pursue
the
most
costly
tutors
in
the
world
were
provided
for
him
at
public
expense
lord
palmerston
lord
russell
lord
westbury
lord
selborne
gladstone
lord
granville
and
their
associates
paid
by
the
british
government
william
seward
charles
francis
adams
william
maxwell
evarts
thurlow
weed
and
other
considerable
professors
employed
by
the
american
government
but
there
was
only
one
student
to
profit
by
this
immense
staff
of
teachers
the
private
secretary
alone
sought
education
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
labored
over
the
lessons
then
taught
never
was
demonstration
more
tangled
hegel
metaphysical
doctrine
of
the
identity
of
opposites
was
simpler
and
easier
to
understand
yet
the
stages
of
demonstration
were
clear
they
began
in
june
after
the
escape
of
one
rebel
cruiser
by
the
remonstrances
of
the
minister
against
the
escape
of
no
which
was
imminent
lord
russell
declined
to
act
on
the
evidence
new
evidence
was
sent
in
every
few
days
and
with
it
on
july
was
included
collier
legal
opinion
it
appears
difficult
to
make
out
a
stronger
case
of
infringement
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
which
if
not
enforced
on
this
occasion
is
little
better
than
a
dead
letter
such
language
implied
almost
a
charge
of
collusion
with
the
rebel
agents
an
intent
to
aid
the
confederacy
in
spite
of
the
warning
earl
russell
let
the
ship
four
days
afterwards
escape
young
adams
had
nothing
to
do
with
law
that
was
business
of
his
betters
his
opinion
of
law
hung
on
his
opinion
of
lawyers
in
spite
of
thurlow
weed
advice
could
one
afford
to
trust
human
nature
in
politics
history
said
not
sir
robert
collier
seemed
to
hold
that
law
agreed
with
history
for
education
the
point
was
vital
if
one
could
not
trust
a
dozen
of
the
most
respected
private
characters
in
the
world
composing
the
queen
ministry
one
could
trust
no
mortal
man
lord
russell
felt
the
force
of
this
inference
and
undertook
to
disprove
it
his
effort
lasted
till
his
death
at
first
he
excused
himself
by
throwing
the
blame
on
the
law
officers
this
was
a
politician
practice
and
the
lawyers
overruled
it
then
he
pleaded
guilty
to
criminal
negligence
and
said
in
his
recollections
i
assent
entirely
to
the
opinion
of
the
lord
chief
justice
of
england
that
the
alabama
ought
to
have
been
detained
during
the
four
days
i
was
waiting
for
the
opinion
of
the
law
officers
but
i
think
that
the
fault
was
not
that
of
the
commissioners
of
customs
it
was
my
fault
as
secretary
of
state
for
foreign
affairs
this
concession
brought
all
parties
on
common
ground
of
course
it
was
his
fault
the
true
issue
lay
not
in
the
question
of
his
fault
but
of
his
intent
to
a
young
man
getting
an
education
in
politics
there
could
be
no
sense
in
history
unless
a
constant
course
of
faults
implied
a
constant
motive
for
his
father
the
question
was
not
so
abstruse
it
was
a
practical
matter
of
business
to
be
handled
as
weed
or
evarts
handled
their
bargains
and
jobs
minister
adams
held
the
convenient
belief
that
in
the
main
russell
was
true
and
the
theory
answered
his
purposes
so
well
that
he
died
still
holding
it
his
son
was
seeking
education
and
wanted
to
know
whether
he
could
in
politics
risk
trusting
any
one
unfortunately
no
one
could
then
decide
no
one
knew
the
facts
minister
adams
died
without
knowing
them
henry
adams
was
an
older
man
than
his
father
in
before
he
learned
a
part
of
them
the
most
curious
fact
even
then
was
that
russell
believed
in
his
own
good
faith
and
that
argyll
believed
in
it
also
argyll
betrayed
a
taste
for
throwing
the
blame
on
bethell
lord
westbury
then
lord
chancellor
but
this
escape
helped
adams
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
complicated
the
case
of
russell
in
england
one
half
of
society
enjoyed
throwing
stones
at
lord
palmerston
while
the
other
half
delighted
in
flinging
mud
at
earl
russell
but
every
one
of
every
party
united
in
pelting
westbury
with
every
missile
at
hand
the
private
secretary
had
no
doubts
about
him
for
he
never
professed
to
be
moral
he
was
the
head
and
heart
of
the
whole
rebel
contention
and
his
opinions
on
neutrality
were
as
clear
as
they
were
on
morality
the
private
secretary
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
regretted
it
for
lord
westbury
wit
and
wisdom
were
great
but
as
far
as
his
authority
went
he
affirmed
the
law
that
in
politics
no
man
should
be
trusted
russell
alone
insisted
on
his
honesty
of
intention
and
persuaded
both
the
duke
and
the
minister
to
believe
him
every
one
in
the
legation
accepted
his
assurances
as
the
only
assertions
they
could
venture
to
trust
they
knew
he
expected
the
rebels
to
win
in
the
end
but
they
believed
he
would
not
actively
interpose
to
decide
it
on
that
on
nothing
else
they
rested
their
frail
hopes
of
remaining
a
day
longer
in
england
minister
adams
remained
six
years
longer
in
england
then
returned
to
america
to
lead
a
busy
life
till
he
died
in
still
holding
the
same
faith
in
earl
russell
who
had
died
in
in
spencer
walpole
published
the
official
life
of
earl
russell
and
told
a
part
of
the
story
which
had
never
been
known
to
the
minister
and
which
astounded
his
son
who
burned
with
curiosity
to
know
what
his
father
would
have
said
of
it
the
story
was
this
the
alabama
escaped
by
russell
confessed
negligence
on
july
in
america
the
union
armies
had
suffered
great
disasters
before
richmond
and
at
the
second
bull
run
august
followed
by
lee
invasion
of
maryland
september
the
news
of
which
arriving
in
england
on
september
roused
the
natural
idea
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
the
next
news
was
expected
by
the
confederates
to
announce
the
fall
of
washington
or
baltimore
palmerston
instantly
september
wrote
to
russell
if
this
should
happen
would
it
not
be
time
for
us
to
consider
whether
in
such
a
state
of
things
england
and
france
might
not
address
the
contending
parties
and
recommend
an
arrangement
on
the
basis
of
separation
this
letter
quite
in
the
line
of
palmerston
supposed
opinions
would
have
surprised
no
one
if
it
had
been
communicated
to
the
legation
and
indeed
if
lee
had
captured
washington
no
one
could
have
blamed
palmerston
for
offering
intervention
not
letter
but
russell
reply
merited
the
painful
attention
of
a
young
man
seeking
a
moral
standard
for
judging
politicians
gotha
september
my
dear
palmerston
whether
the
federal
army
is
destroyed
or
not
it
is
clear
that
it
is
driven
back
to
washington
and
has
made
no
progress
in
subduing
the
insurgent
states
such
being
the
case
i
agree
with
you
that
the
time
is
come
for
offering
mediation
to
the
united
states
government
with
a
view
to
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
the
confederates
i
agree
further
that
in
case
of
failure
we
ought
ourselves
to
recognize
the
southern
states
as
an
independent
state
for
the
purpose
of
taking
so
important
a
step
i
think
we
must
have
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
the
or
would
suit
me
for
the
meeting
we
ought
then
if
we
agree
on
such
a
step
to
propose
it
first
to
france
and
then
on
the
part
of
england
and
france
to
russia
and
other
powers
as
a
measure
decided
upon
by
us
we
ought
to
make
ourselves
safe
in
canada
not
by
sending
more
troops
there
but
by
concentrating
those
we
have
in
a
few
defensible
posts
before
the
winter
sets
in
here
then
appeared
in
its
fullest
force
the
practical
difficulty
in
education
which
a
mere
student
could
never
overcome
a
difficulty
not
in
theory
or
knowledge
or
even
want
of
experience
but
in
the
sheer
chaos
of
human
nature
lord
russell
course
had
been
consistent
from
the
first
and
had
all
the
look
of
rigid
determination
to
recognize
the
southern
confederacy
with
a
view
to
breaking
up
the
union
his
letter
of
september
hung
directly
on
his
encouragement
of
the
alabama
and
his
protection
of
the
rebel
navy
while
the
whole
of
his
plan
had
its
root
in
the
proclamation
of
belligerency
may
the
policy
had
every
look
of
persistent
forethought
but
it
took
for
granted
the
deliberate
dishonesty
of
three
famous
men
palmerston
russell
and
gladstone
this
dishonesty
as
concerned
russell
was
denied
by
russell
himself
and
disbelieved
by
argyll
forster
and
most
of
america
friends
in
england
as
well
as
by
minister
adams
what
the
minister
would
have
thought
had
he
seen
this
letter
of
september
his
son
would
have
greatly
liked
to
know
but
he
would
have
liked
still
more
to
know
what
the
minister
would
have
thought
of
answer
dated
september
it
is
evident
that
a
great
conflict
is
taking
place
to
the
northwest
of
washington
and
its
issue
must
have
a
great
effect
on
the
state
of
affairs
if
the
federals
sustain
a
great
defeat
they
may
be
at
once
ready
for
mediation
and
the
iron
should
be
struck
while
it
is
hot
if
on
the
other
hand
they
should
have
the
best
of
it
we
may
wait
a
while
and
see
what
may
follow
the
roles
were
reversed
russell
wrote
what
was
expected
from
palmerston
or
even
more
violently
while
palmerston
wrote
what
was
expected
from
russell
or
even
more
temperately
the
private
secretary
view
had
been
altogether
wrong
which
would
not
have
much
surprised
even
him
but
he
would
have
been
greatly
astonished
to
learn
that
the
most
confidential
associates
of
these
men
knew
little
more
about
their
intentions
than
was
known
in
the
legation
the
most
trusted
member
of
the
cabinet
was
lord
granville
and
to
him
russell
next
wrote
granville
replied
at
once
decidedly
opposing
recognition
of
the
confederacy
and
russell
sent
the
reply
to
palmerston
who
returned
it
october
with
the
mere
suggestion
of
waiting
for
further
news
from
america
at
the
same
time
granville
wrote
to
another
member
of
the
cabinet
lord
stanley
of
alderley
a
letter
published
forty
years
afterwards
in
granville
life
i
to
the
private
secretary
altogether
the
most
curious
and
instructive
relic
of
the
whole
lesson
in
politics
i
have
written
to
johnny
my
reasons
for
thinking
it
decidedly
premature
i
however
suspect
you
will
settle
to
do
so
johnny
and
gladstone
would
be
in
favor
of
it
and
probably
newcastle
i
do
not
know
about
the
others
it
appears
to
me
a
great
mistake
out
of
a
cabinet
of
a
dozen
members
granville
the
best
informed
of
them
all
could
pick
only
three
who
would
favor
recognition
even
a
private
secretary
thought
he
knew
as
much
as
this
or
more
ignorance
was
not
confined
to
the
young
and
insignificant
nor
were
they
the
only
victims
of
blindness
granville
letter
made
only
one
point
clear
he
knew
of
no
fixed
policy
or
conspiracy
if
any
existed
it
was
confined
to
palmerston
russell
gladstone
and
perhaps
newcastle
in
truth
the
legation
knew
then
all
that
was
to
be
known
and
the
true
fault
of
education
was
to
suspect
too
much
by
that
time
october
news
of
antietam
and
of
lee
retreat
into
virginia
had
reached
london
the
emancipation
proclamation
arrived
had
the
private
secretary
known
all
that
granville
or
palmerston
knew
he
would
surely
have
thought
the
danger
past
at
least
for
a
time
and
any
man
of
common
sense
would
have
told
him
to
stop
worrying
over
phantoms
this
healthy
lesson
would
have
been
worth
much
for
practical
education
but
it
was
quite
upset
by
the
sudden
rush
of
a
new
actor
upon
the
stage
with
a
rhapsody
that
made
russell
seem
sane
and
all
education
superfluous
this
new
actor
as
every
one
knows
was
william
ewart
gladstone
then
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
if
in
the
domain
of
the
world
politics
one
point
was
fixed
one
value
ascertained
one
element
serious
it
was
the
british
exchequer
and
if
one
man
lived
who
could
be
certainly
counted
as
sane
by
overwhelming
interest
it
was
the
man
who
had
in
charge
the
finances
of
england
if
education
had
the
smallest
value
it
should
have
shown
its
force
in
gladstone
who
was
educated
beyond
all
record
of
english
training
from
him
if
from
no
one
else
the
poor
student
could
safely
learn
here
is
what
he
learned
palmerston
notified
gladstone
september
of
the
proposed
intervention
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
would
be
inclined
to
approve
such
a
course
gladstone
replied
the
next
day
he
was
glad
to
learn
what
the
prime
minister
had
told
him
and
for
two
reasons
especially
he
desired
that
the
proceedings
should
be
prompt
the
first
was
the
rapid
progress
of
the
southern
arms
and
the
extension
of
the
area
of
southern
feeling
the
second
was
the
risk
of
violent
impatience
in
the
of
lancashire
such
as
would
prejudice
the
dignity
and
disinterestedness
of
the
proffered
mediation
had
the
puzzled
student
seen
this
letter
he
must
have
concluded
from
it
that
the
best
educated
statesman
england
ever
produced
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about
an
assumption
which
all
the
world
would
think
quite
inadmissible
from
a
private
secretary
but
this
was
a
trifle
gladstone
having
thus
arranged
with
palmerston
and
russell
for
intervention
in
the
american
war
reflected
on
the
subject
for
a
fortnight
from
september
to
october
when
he
was
to
speak
on
the
occasion
of
a
great
dinner
at
newcastle
he
decided
to
announce
the
government
policy
with
all
the
force
his
personal
and
official
authority
could
give
it
this
decision
was
no
sudden
impulse
it
was
the
result
of
deep
reflection
pursued
to
the
last
moment
on
the
morning
of
october
he
entered
in
his
diary
reflected
further
on
what
i
should
say
about
lancashire
and
america
for
both
these
subjects
are
critical
that
evening
at
dinner
as
the
mature
fruit
of
his
long
study
he
deliberately
pronounced
the
famous
phrase
we
know
quite
well
that
the
people
of
the
northern
states
have
not
yet
drunk
of
the
cup
they
are
still
trying
to
hold
it
far
from
their
lips
which
all
the
rest
of
the
world
see
they
nevertheless
must
drink
of
we
may
have
our
own
opinions
about
slavery
we
may
be
for
or
against
the
south
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
jefferson
davis
and
other
leaders
of
the
south
have
made
an
army
they
are
making
it
appears
a
navy
and
they
have
made
what
is
more
than
either
they
have
made
a
nation
looking
back
forty
years
afterwards
on
this
episode
one
asked
one
self
painfully
what
sort
of
a
lesson
a
young
man
should
have
drawn
for
the
purposes
of
his
education
from
this
teaching
of
a
very
great
master
in
the
heat
of
passion
at
the
moment
one
drew
some
harsh
moral
conclusions
were
they
incorrect
posed
bluntly
as
rules
of
conduct
they
led
to
the
worst
possible
practices
as
morals
one
could
detect
no
shade
of
difference
between
gladstone
and
napoleon
except
to
the
advantage
of
napoleon
the
private
secretary
saw
none
he
accepted
the
teacher
in
that
sense
he
took
his
lesson
of
political
morality
as
learned
his
notice
to
quit
as
duly
served
and
supposed
his
education
to
be
finished
every
one
thought
so
and
the
whole
city
was
in
a
turmoil
any
intelligent
education
ought
to
end
when
it
is
complete
one
would
then
feel
fewer
hesitations
and
would
handle
a
surer
world
the
logical
drama
required
unity
and
sense
the
actual
drama
is
a
pointless
puzzle
without
even
an
intrigue
when
the
curtain
fell
on
gladstone
speech
any
student
had
the
right
to
suppose
the
drama
ended
none
could
have
affirmed
that
it
was
about
to
begin
that
painful
lesson
was
thrown
away
even
after
forty
years
most
people
would
refuse
to
believe
it
they
would
still
insist
that
gladstone
russell
and
palmerston
were
true
villains
of
melodrama
the
evidence
against
gladstone
in
special
seemed
overwhelming
the
word
must
can
never
be
used
by
a
responsible
minister
of
one
government
towards
another
as
gladstone
used
it
no
one
knew
so
well
as
he
that
he
and
his
own
officials
and
friends
at
liverpool
were
alone
making
a
rebel
navy
and
that
jefferson
davis
had
next
to
nothing
to
do
with
it
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
he
was
the
minister
most
interested
in
knowing
that
palmerston
russell
and
himself
were
banded
together
by
mutual
pledge
to
make
the
confederacy
a
nation
the
next
week
and
that
the
southern
leaders
had
as
yet
no
hope
of
making
a
nation
but
in
them
such
thoughts
occurred
to
every
one
at
the
moment
and
time
only
added
to
their
force
never
in
the
history
of
political
turpitude
had
any
brigand
of
modern
civilization
offered
a
worse
example
the
proof
of
it
was
that
it
outraged
even
palmerston
who
immediately
put
up
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
to
repudiate
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
against
whom
he
turned
his
press
at
the
same
time
palmerston
had
no
notion
of
letting
his
hand
be
forced
by
gladstone
russell
did
nothing
of
the
kind
if
he
agreed
with
palmerston
he
followed
gladstone
although
he
had
just
created
a
new
evangel
of
for
italy
and
preached
it
like
an
apostle
he
preached
the
gospel
of
intervention
in
america
as
though
he
were
a
mouthpiece
of
the
congress
of
vienna
on
october
he
issued
his
call
for
the
cabinet
to
meet
on
october
for
discussion
of
the
duty
of
europe
to
ask
both
parties
in
the
most
friendly
and
conciliatory
terms
to
agree
to
a
suspension
of
arms
meanwhile
minister
adams
deeply
perturbed
and
profoundly
anxious
would
betray
no
sign
of
alarm
and
purposely
delayed
to
ask
explanation
the
howl
of
anger
against
gladstone
became
louder
every
day
for
every
one
knew
that
the
cabinet
was
called
for
october
and
then
could
not
fail
to
decide
its
policy
about
the
united
states
lord
lyons
put
off
his
departure
for
america
till
october
expressly
to
share
in
the
conclusions
to
be
discussed
on
october
when
minister
adams
at
last
requested
an
interview
russell
named
october
as
the
day
to
the
last
moment
every
act
of
russell
showed
that
in
his
mind
the
intervention
was
still
in
doubt
when
minister
adams
at
the
interview
suggested
that
an
explanation
was
due
him
he
watched
russell
with
natural
interest
and
reported
thus
his
lordship
took
my
allusion
at
once
though
not
without
a
slight
indication
of
embarrassment
he
said
that
gladstone
had
been
evidently
much
misunderstood
i
must
have
seen
in
the
newspapers
the
letters
which
contained
his
later
explanations
that
he
had
certain
opinions
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
struggle
in
america
as
on
all
public
questions
just
as
other
englishmen
had
was
natural
enough
and
it
was
the
fashion
here
for
public
men
to
express
such
as
they
held
in
their
public
addresses
of
course
it
was
not
for
him
to
disavow
anything
on
the
part
of
gladstone
but
he
had
no
idea
that
in
saying
what
he
had
there
was
a
serious
intention
to
justify
any
of
the
inferences
that
had
been
drawn
from
it
of
a
disposition
in
the
government
now
to
adopt
a
new
policy
a
student
trying
to
learn
the
processes
of
politics
in
a
free
government
could
not
but
ponder
long
on
the
moral
to
be
drawn
from
this
explanation
of
gladstone
by
earl
russell
the
point
set
for
study
as
the
first
condition
of
political
life
was
whether
any
politician
could
be
believed
or
trusted
the
question
which
a
private
secretary
asked
himself
in
copying
this
despatch
of
october
was
whether
his
father
believed
or
should
believe
one
word
of
lord
russell
embarrassment
the
truth
was
not
known
for
thirty
years
but
when
published
seemed
to
be
the
reverse
of
earl
statement
gladstone
speech
had
been
drawn
out
by
russell
own
policy
of
intervention
and
had
no
sense
except
to
declare
the
disposition
in
the
government
now
to
adopt
that
new
policy
earl
russell
never
disavowed
gladstone
although
lord
palmerston
and
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
instantly
did
so
as
far
as
the
curious
student
could
penetrate
the
mystery
gladstone
exactly
expressed
earl
intent
as
political
education
this
lesson
was
to
be
crucial
it
would
decide
the
law
of
life
all
these
gentlemen
were
superlatively
honorable
if
one
could
not
believe
them
truth
in
politics
might
be
ignored
as
a
delusion
therefore
the
student
felt
compelled
to
reach
some
sort
of
idea
that
should
serve
to
bring
the
case
within
a
general
law
minister
adams
felt
the
same
compulsion
he
bluntly
told
russell
that
while
he
was
willing
to
acquit
gladstone
of
any
deliberate
intention
to
bring
on
the
worst
effects
he
was
bound
to
say
that
gladstone
was
doing
it
quite
as
certainly
as
if
he
had
one
and
to
this
charge
which
struck
more
sharply
at
russell
secret
policy
than
at
gladstone
public
defence
of
it
russell
replied
as
well
as
he
could
his
lordship
intimated
as
guardedly
as
possible
that
lord
palmerston
and
other
members
of
the
government
regretted
the
speech
and
gladstone
himself
was
not
disinclined
to
correct
as
far
as
he
could
the
misinterpretation
which
had
been
made
of
it
it
was
still
their
intention
to
adhere
to
the
rule
of
perfect
neutrality
in
the
struggle
and
to
let
it
come
to
its
natural
end
without
the
smallest
interference
direct
or
otherwise
but
he
could
not
say
what
circumstances
might
happen
from
month
to
month
in
the
future
i
observed
that
the
policy
he
mentioned
was
satisfactory
to
us
and
asked
if
i
was
to
understand
him
as
saying
that
no
change
of
it
was
now
proposed
to
which
he
gave
his
assent
minister
adams
never
knew
more
he
retained
his
belief
that
russell
could
be
trusted
but
that
palmerston
could
not
this
was
the
diplomatic
tradition
especially
held
by
the
russian
diplomats
possibly
it
was
sound
but
it
helped
in
no
way
the
education
of
a
private
secretary
the
theory
offered
no
safer
clue
than
the
frank
honest
theory
of
villainy
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
was
reasonable
no
one
ever
told
the
minister
that
earl
russell
only
a
few
hours
before
had
asked
the
cabinet
to
intervene
and
that
the
cabinet
had
refused
the
minister
was
led
to
believe
that
the
cabinet
meeting
was
not
held
and
that
its
decision
was
informal
russell
biographer
said
that
with
this
memorandum
of
russell
dated
october
the
cabinet
assembled
from
all
parts
of
the
country
on
october
but
members
of
the
cabinet
doubted
the
policy
of
moving
or
moving
at
that
time
the
duke
of
newcastle
and
sir
george
grey
joined
granville
in
opposition
as
far
as
known
russell
and
gladstone
stood
alone
considerations
such
as
these
prevented
the
matter
being
pursued
any
further
still
no
one
has
distinctly
said
that
this
decision
was
formal
perhaps
the
unanimity
of
opposition
made
the
formal
cabinet
unnecessary
but
it
is
certain
that
within
an
hour
or
two
before
or
after
this
decision
his
lordship
said
to
the
united
states
minister
that
the
policy
of
the
government
was
to
adhere
to
a
strict
neutrality
and
to
leave
this
struggle
to
settle
itself
when
adams
not
satisfied
even
with
this
positive
assurance
pressed
for
a
categorical
answer
i
asked
him
if
i
was
to
understand
that
policy
as
not
now
to
be
changed
he
said
yes
john
morley
comment
on
this
matter
in
the
life
of
gladstone
forty
years
afterwards
would
have
interested
the
minister
as
well
as
his
private
secretary
if
this
relation
be
accurate
said
morley
of
a
relation
officially
published
at
the
time
and
never
questioned
then
the
foreign
secretary
did
not
construe
strict
neutrality
as
excluding
what
diplomatists
call
good
offices
for
a
vital
lesson
in
politics
earl
russell
construction
of
neutrality
mattered
little
to
the
student
who
asked
only
russell
intent
and
cared
only
to
know
whether
his
construction
had
any
other
object
than
to
deceive
the
minister
in
the
grave
one
can
afford
to
be
lavish
of
charity
and
possibly
earl
russell
may
have
been
honestly
glad
to
reassure
his
personal
friend
adams
but
to
one
who
is
still
in
the
world
even
if
not
of
it
doubts
are
as
plenty
as
days
earl
russell
totally
deceived
the
private
secretary
whatever
he
may
have
done
to
the
minister
the
policy
of
abstention
was
not
settled
on
october
only
the
next
day
october
gladstone
circulated
a
rejoinder
to
lewis
insisting
on
the
duty
of
england
france
and
russia
to
intervene
by
representing
with
moral
authority
and
force
the
opinion
of
the
civilized
world
upon
the
conditions
of
the
case
nothing
had
been
decided
by
some
means
scarcely
accidental
the
french
emperor
was
led
to
think
that
his
influence
might
turn
the
scale
and
only
ten
days
after
russell
categorical
yes
napoleon
officially
invited
him
to
say
no
he
was
more
than
ready
to
do
so
another
cabinet
meeting
was
called
for
november
and
this
time
gladstone
himself
reports
the
debate
we
have
had
our
cabinet
and
meet
again
tomorrow
i
am
afraid
we
shall
do
little
or
nothing
in
the
business
of
america
but
i
will
send
you
definite
intelligence
both
lords
palmerston
and
russell
are
right
the
united
states
affair
has
ended
and
not
well
lord
russell
rather
turned
tail
he
gave
way
without
resolutely
fighting
out
his
battle
however
though
we
decline
for
the
moment
the
answer
is
put
upon
grounds
and
in
terms
which
leave
the
matter
very
open
for
the
future
i
think
the
french
will
make
our
answer
about
america
public
at
least
it
is
very
possible
but
i
hope
they
may
not
take
it
as
a
positive
refusal
or
at
any
rate
that
they
may
themselves
act
in
the
matter
it
will
be
clear
that
we
concur
with
them
that
the
war
should
cease
palmerston
gave
to
russell
proposal
a
feeble
and
support
forty
years
afterwards
when
every
one
except
himself
who
looked
on
at
this
scene
was
dead
the
private
secretary
of
read
these
lines
with
stupor
and
hurried
to
discuss
them
with
john
hay
who
was
more
astounded
than
himself
all
the
world
had
been
at
had
misunderstood
themselves
and
the
situation
had
followed
wrong
paths
drawn
wrong
conclusions
had
known
none
of
the
facts
one
would
have
done
better
to
draw
no
conclusions
at
all
diplomatic
education
was
a
long
mistake
these
were
the
terms
of
this
singular
problem
as
they
presented
themselves
to
the
student
of
diplomacy
in
palmerston
on
september
under
the
impression
that
the
president
was
about
to
be
driven
from
washington
and
the
army
of
the
potomac
dispersed
suggested
to
russell
that
in
such
a
case
intervention
might
be
feasible
russell
instantly
answered
that
in
any
case
he
wanted
to
intervene
and
should
call
a
cabinet
for
the
purpose
palmerston
hesitated
russell
insisted
granville
protested
meanwhile
the
rebel
army
was
defeated
at
antietam
september
and
driven
out
of
maryland
then
gladstone
october
tried
to
force
palmerston
hand
by
treating
the
intervention
as
a
fait
accompli
russell
assented
but
palmerston
put
up
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
to
contradict
gladstone
and
treated
him
sharply
in
the
press
at
the
very
moment
when
russell
was
calling
a
cabinet
to
make
words
good
on
october
russell
assured
adams
that
no
change
in
policy
was
now
proposed
on
the
same
day
he
had
proposed
it
and
was
voted
down
instantly
napoleon
iii
appeared
as
the
ally
of
russell
and
gladstone
with
a
proposition
which
had
no
sense
except
as
a
bribe
to
palmerston
to
replace
america
from
pole
to
pole
in
her
old
dependence
on
europe
and
to
replace
england
in
her
old
sovereignty
of
the
seas
if
palmerston
would
support
france
in
mexico
the
young
student
of
diplomacy
knowing
palmerston
must
have
taken
for
granted
that
palmerston
inspired
this
motion
and
would
support
it
knowing
russell
and
his
whig
antecedents
he
would
conceive
that
russell
must
oppose
it
knowing
gladstone
and
his
lofty
principles
he
would
not
doubt
that
gladstone
violently
denounced
the
scheme
if
education
was
worth
a
straw
this
was
the
only
arrangement
of
persons
that
a
trained
student
would
imagine
possible
and
it
was
the
arrangement
actually
assumed
by
nine
men
out
of
ten
as
history
in
truth
each
valuation
was
false
palmerston
never
showed
favor
to
the
scheme
and
gave
it
only
a
feeble
and
support
russell
gave
way
without
resolutely
fighting
out
his
battle
the
only
resolute
vehement
conscientious
champion
of
russell
napoleon
and
jefferson
davis
was
gladstone
other
people
could
afford
to
laugh
at
a
young
man
blunders
but
to
him
the
best
part
of
life
was
thrown
away
if
he
learned
such
a
lesson
wrong
henry
james
had
not
yet
taught
the
world
to
read
a
volume
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
lights
of
his
turned
on
alternate
sides
of
the
same
figure
psychological
study
was
still
simple
and
at
worst
or
at
best
english
character
was
never
subtile
surely
no
one
would
believe
that
complexity
was
the
trait
that
confused
the
student
of
palmerston
russell
and
gladstone
under
a
very
strong
light
human
nature
will
always
appear
complex
and
full
of
contradictions
but
the
british
statesman
would
appear
on
the
whole
among
the
least
complex
of
men
complex
these
gentlemen
were
not
disraeli
alone
might
by
contrast
be
called
complex
but
palmerston
russell
and
gladstone
deceived
only
by
their
simplicity
russell
was
the
most
interesting
to
a
young
man
because
his
conduct
seemed
most
statesmanlike
every
act
of
russell
from
april
to
november
showed
the
clearest
determination
to
break
up
the
union
the
only
point
in
character
about
which
the
student
thought
no
doubt
to
be
possible
was
its
want
of
good
faith
it
was
thoroughly
dishonest
but
strong
habitually
russell
said
one
thing
and
did
another
he
seemed
unconscious
of
his
own
contradictions
even
when
his
opponents
pointed
them
out
as
they
were
much
in
the
habit
of
doing
in
the
strongest
language
as
the
student
watched
him
deal
with
the
civil
war
in
america
russell
alone
showed
persistence
even
obstinacy
in
a
definite
determination
which
he
supported
as
was
necessary
by
the
usual
definite
falsehoods
the
young
man
did
not
complain
of
the
falsehoods
on
the
contrary
he
was
vain
of
his
own
insight
in
detecting
them
but
he
was
wholly
upset
by
the
idea
that
russell
should
think
himself
true
young
adams
thought
earl
russell
a
statesman
of
the
old
school
clear
about
his
objects
and
unscrupulous
in
his
methods
dishonest
but
strong
russell
ardently
asserted
that
he
had
no
objects
and
that
though
he
might
be
weak
he
was
above
all
else
honest
minister
adams
leaned
to
russell
personally
and
thought
him
true
but
officially
in
practice
treated
him
as
false
punch
before
commonly
drew
russell
as
a
schoolboy
telling
lies
and
afterwards
as
prematurely
senile
at
seventy
education
stopped
there
no
one
either
in
or
out
of
england
ever
offered
a
rational
explanation
of
earl
russell
palmerston
was
simple
so
simple
as
to
mislead
the
student
altogether
but
scarcely
more
consistent
the
world
thought
him
positive
decided
reckless
the
record
proved
him
to
be
cautious
careful
vacillating
minister
adams
took
him
for
pugnacious
and
quarrelsome
the
lives
of
russell
gladstone
and
granville
show
him
to
have
been
conciliatory
avoiding
quarrels
he
surprised
the
minister
by
refusing
to
pursue
his
attack
on
general
butler
he
tried
to
check
russell
he
scolded
gladstone
he
discouraged
napoleon
except
disraeli
none
of
the
english
statesmen
were
so
cautious
as
he
in
talking
of
america
palmerston
told
no
falsehoods
made
no
professions
concealed
no
opinions
was
detected
in
no
the
most
mortifying
failure
in
henry
adams
long
education
was
that
after
forty
years
of
confirmed
dislike
distrust
and
detraction
of
lord
palmerston
he
was
obliged
at
last
to
admit
himself
in
error
and
to
consent
in
spirit
for
by
that
time
he
was
nearly
as
dead
as
any
of
them
to
beg
his
pardon
gladstone
was
quite
another
story
but
with
him
a
difficulties
were
less
because
they
were
shared
by
all
the
world
including
gladstone
himself
he
was
the
sum
of
contradictions
the
highest
education
could
reach
in
this
analysis
only
a
reduction
to
the
absurd
but
no
absurdity
that
a
young
man
could
reach
in
would
have
approached
the
level
that
gladstone
admitted
avowed
proclaimed
in
his
confessions
of
which
brought
all
reason
and
all
hope
of
education
to
a
i
have
yet
to
record
an
undoubted
error
the
most
singular
and
palpable
i
may
add
the
least
excusable
of
them
all
especially
since
it
was
committed
so
late
as
in
the
year
when
i
had
outlived
half
a
century
i
declared
in
the
heat
of
the
american
struggle
that
jefferson
davis
had
made
a
nation
strange
to
say
this
declaration
most
unwarrantable
to
be
made
by
a
minister
of
the
crown
with
no
authority
other
than
his
own
was
not
due
to
any
feeling
of
partisanship
for
the
south
or
hostility
to
the
north
i
really
though
most
strangely
believed
that
it
was
an
act
of
friendliness
to
all
america
to
recognize
that
the
struggle
was
virtually
at
an
end
that
my
opinion
was
founded
upon
a
false
estimate
of
the
facts
was
the
very
least
part
of
my
fault
i
did
not
perceive
the
gross
impropriety
of
such
an
utterance
from
a
cabinet
minister
of
a
power
allied
in
blood
and
language
and
bound
to
loyal
neutrality
the
case
being
further
exaggerated
by
the
fact
that
we
were
already
so
to
speak
under
indictment
before
the
world
for
not
as
was
alleged
having
strictly
enforced
the
laws
of
neutrality
in
the
matter
of
the
cruisers
my
offence
was
indeed
only
a
mistake
but
one
of
incredible
grossness
and
with
such
consequences
of
offence
and
alarm
attached
to
it
that
my
failing
to
perceive
them
justly
exposed
me
to
very
severe
blame
it
illustrates
vividly
that
incapacity
which
my
mind
so
long
retained
and
perhaps
still
exhibits
an
incapacity
of
viewing
subjects
all
round
long
and
patiently
more
than
patiently
sympathetically
did
the
private
secretary
forty
years
afterwards
in
the
twilight
of
a
life
of
study
read
and
and
reflect
upon
this
confession
then
it
seemed
he
had
seen
nothing
correctly
at
the
time
his
whole
theory
of
conspiracy
of
policy
of
logic
and
connection
in
the
affairs
of
man
resolved
itself
into
incredible
grossness
he
felt
no
rancor
for
he
had
won
the
game
he
forgave
since
he
must
admit
the
incapacity
of
viewing
subjects
all
round
which
had
so
nearly
cost
him
life
and
fortune
he
was
willing
even
to
believe
he
noted
without
irritation
that
gladstone
in
his
confession
had
not
alluded
to
the
understanding
between
russell
palmerston
and
himself
had
even
wholly
left
out
his
most
incredible
act
his
ardent
support
of
napoleon
policy
a
policy
which
even
palmerston
and
russell
had
supported
feebly
with
only
half
a
heart
all
this
was
indifferent
granting
in
spite
of
evidence
that
gladstone
had
no
set
plan
of
breaking
up
the
union
that
he
was
party
to
no
conspiracy
that
he
saw
none
of
the
results
of
his
acts
which
were
clear
to
every
one
else
granting
in
short
what
the
english
themselves
seemed
at
last
to
conclude
that
gladstone
was
not
quite
sane
that
russell
was
verging
on
senility
and
that
palmerston
had
lost
his
nerve
what
sort
of
education
should
have
been
the
result
of
it
how
should
it
have
affected
one
future
opinions
and
acts
politics
can
not
stop
to
study
psychology
its
methods
are
rough
its
judgments
rougher
still
all
this
knowledge
would
not
have
affected
either
the
minister
or
his
son
in
the
sum
of
the
individuals
would
still
have
seemed
to
the
young
man
one
individual
a
single
will
or
intention
bent
on
breaking
up
the
union
as
a
diminution
of
a
dangerous
power
the
minister
would
still
have
found
his
interest
in
thinking
russell
friendly
and
palmerston
hostile
the
individual
would
still
have
been
identical
with
the
mass
the
problem
would
have
been
the
same
the
answer
equally
obscure
every
student
would
like
the
private
secretary
answer
for
himself
alone
chapter
xi
the
battle
of
the
rams
minister
adams
troubled
himself
little
about
what
he
did
not
see
of
an
enemy
his
son
a
nervous
animal
made
life
a
terror
by
seeing
too
much
minister
adams
played
his
hand
as
it
came
and
seldom
credited
his
opponents
with
greater
intelligence
than
his
own
earl
russell
suited
him
perhaps
a
certain
personal
sympathy
united
them
and
indeed
henry
adams
never
saw
russell
without
being
amused
by
his
droll
likeness
to
john
quincy
adams
apart
from
this
shadowy
personal
relation
no
doubt
the
minister
was
diplomatically
right
he
had
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain
by
making
a
friend
of
the
foreign
secretary
and
whether
russell
were
true
or
false
mattered
less
because
in
either
case
the
american
legation
could
act
only
as
though
he
were
false
had
the
minister
known
russell
determined
effort
to
betray
and
ruin
him
in
october
he
could
have
scarcely
used
stronger
expressions
than
he
did
in
russell
must
have
been
greatly
annoyed
by
sir
robert
collier
hint
of
collusion
with
the
rebel
agents
in
the
alabama
case
but
he
hardened
himself
to
hear
the
same
innuendo
repeated
in
nearly
every
note
from
the
legation
as
time
went
on
russell
was
compelled
though
slowly
to
treat
the
american
minister
as
serious
he
admitted
nothing
so
unwillingly
for
the
nullity
or
fatuity
of
the
washington
government
was
his
idee
fixe
but
after
the
failure
of
his
last
effort
for
joint
intervention
on
november
only
one
week
elapsed
before
he
received
a
note
from
minister
adams
repeating
his
charges
about
the
alabama
and
asking
in
very
plain
language
for
redress
perhaps
russell
mind
was
naturally
slow
to
understand
the
force
of
sudden
attack
or
perhaps
age
had
affected
it
this
was
one
of
the
points
that
greatly
interested
a
student
but
young
men
have
a
passion
for
regarding
their
elders
as
senile
which
was
only
in
part
warranted
in
this
instance
by
observing
that
generation
were
mostly
senile
from
youth
they
had
never
got
beyond
both
palmerston
and
russell
were
in
this
case
their
senility
was
congenital
like
gladstone
oxford
training
and
high
church
illusions
which
caused
wild
eccentricities
in
his
judgment
russell
could
not
conceive
that
he
had
misunderstood
and
mismanaged
minister
adams
from
the
start
and
when
after
november
he
found
himself
on
the
defensive
with
mr
adams
taking
daily
a
stronger
tone
he
showed
mere
confusion
and
helplessness
thus
whatever
the
theory
the
action
of
diplomacy
had
to
be
the
same
minister
adams
was
obliged
to
imply
collusion
between
russell
and
the
rebels
he
could
not
even
stop
at
criminal
negligence
if
by
an
access
of
courtesy
the
minister
were
civil
enough
to
admit
that
the
escape
of
the
alabama
had
been
due
to
criminal
negligence
he
could
make
no
such
concession
in
regard
to
the
ironclad
rams
which
the
lairds
were
building
for
no
one
could
be
so
simple
as
to
believe
that
two
armored
could
be
built
publicly
under
the
eyes
of
the
government
and
go
to
sea
like
the
alabama
without
active
and
incessant
collusion
the
longer
earl
russell
kept
on
his
mask
of
assumed
ignorance
the
more
violently
in
the
end
the
minister
would
have
to
tear
it
off
whatever
adams
might
personally
think
of
earl
russell
he
must
take
the
greatest
possible
diplomatic
liberties
with
him
if
this
crisis
were
allowed
to
arrive
as
the
spring
of
drew
on
the
vast
field
cleared
itself
for
action
a
campaign
more
beautiful
better
suited
for
training
the
mind
of
a
youth
eager
for
training
has
not
often
unrolled
itself
for
study
from
the
beginning
before
a
young
man
perched
in
so
commanding
a
position
very
slowly
indeed
after
two
years
of
solitude
one
began
to
feel
the
first
faint
flush
of
new
and
imperial
life
one
was
years
old
and
quite
ready
to
assert
it
some
of
friends
were
wearing
stars
on
their
collars
some
had
won
stars
of
a
more
enduring
kind
at
moments
one
breath
came
quick
one
began
to
dream
the
sensation
of
wielding
unmeasured
power
the
sense
came
like
vertigo
for
an
instant
and
passed
leaving
the
brain
a
little
dazed
doubtful
shy
with
an
intensity
more
painful
than
that
of
any
shakespearean
drama
men
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
armies
in
the
field
little
by
little
at
first
only
as
a
shadowy
chance
of
what
might
be
if
things
could
be
rightly
done
one
began
to
feel
that
somewhere
behind
the
chaos
in
washington
power
was
taking
shape
that
it
was
massed
and
guided
as
it
had
not
been
before
men
seemed
to
have
learned
their
business
at
a
cost
that
ruined
and
perhaps
too
late
a
private
secretary
knew
better
than
most
people
how
much
of
the
new
power
was
to
be
swung
in
london
and
almost
exactly
when
but
the
diplomatic
campaign
had
to
wait
for
the
military
campaign
to
lead
the
student
could
only
study
life
never
could
know
more
than
a
single
such
climax
in
that
form
education
reached
its
limits
as
the
first
great
blows
began
to
fall
one
curled
up
in
bed
in
the
silence
of
night
to
listen
with
incredulous
hope
as
the
huge
masses
struck
one
after
another
with
the
precision
of
machinery
the
opposing
mass
the
world
shivered
such
development
of
power
was
unknown
the
magnificent
resistance
and
the
return
shocks
heightened
the
suspense
during
the
july
days
londoners
were
stupid
with
unbelief
they
were
learning
from
the
yankees
how
to
fight
an
american
saw
in
a
flash
what
all
this
meant
to
england
for
one
mind
was
working
with
the
acceleration
of
the
machine
at
home
but
englishmen
were
not
quick
to
see
their
blunders
one
had
ample
time
to
watch
the
process
and
had
even
a
little
time
to
gloat
over
the
repayment
of
old
scores
news
of
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
reached
london
one
sunday
afternoon
and
it
happened
that
henry
adams
was
asked
for
that
evening
to
some
small
reception
at
the
house
of
monckton
milnes
he
went
early
in
order
to
exchange
a
word
or
two
of
congratulation
before
the
rooms
should
fill
and
on
arriving
he
found
only
the
ladies
in
the
the
gentlemen
were
still
sitting
over
their
wine
presently
they
came
in
and
as
luck
would
have
it
delane
of
the
times
came
first
when
milnes
caught
sight
of
his
young
american
friend
with
a
whoop
of
triumph
he
rushed
to
throw
both
arms
about
his
neck
and
kiss
him
on
both
cheeks
men
of
later
birth
who
knew
too
little
to
realize
the
passions
of
backed
by
those
of
and
reenforced
by
those
of
might
conceive
that
such
publicity
embarrassed
a
private
secretary
who
came
from
boston
and
called
himself
shy
but
that
evening
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
happened
not
to
be
thinking
of
himself
he
was
thinking
of
delane
whose
eye
caught
his
at
the
moment
of
milnes
embrace
delane
probably
regarded
it
as
a
piece
of
milnes
foolery
he
had
never
heard
of
young
adams
and
never
dreamed
of
his
resentment
at
being
ridiculed
in
the
times
he
had
no
suspicion
of
the
thought
floating
in
the
mind
of
the
american
minister
son
for
the
british
mind
is
the
slowest
of
all
minds
as
the
files
of
the
times
proved
and
the
capture
of
vicksburg
had
not
yet
penetrated
delane
thick
cortex
of
fixed
ideas
even
if
he
had
read
adams
thought
he
would
have
felt
for
it
only
the
usual
amused
british
contempt
for
all
that
he
had
not
been
taught
at
school
it
needed
a
whole
generation
for
the
times
to
reach
standpoint
had
the
minister
son
carried
out
the
thought
he
would
surely
have
sought
an
introduction
to
delane
on
the
spot
and
assured
him
that
he
regarded
his
own
personal
score
as
cleared
off
sufficiently
settled
then
and
there
because
his
father
had
assumed
the
debt
and
was
going
to
deal
with
delane
himself
you
come
next
would
have
been
the
friendly
warning
for
nearly
a
year
the
private
secretary
had
watched
the
board
arranging
itself
for
the
collision
between
the
legation
and
delane
who
stood
behind
the
palmerston
ministry
adams
had
been
steadily
strengthened
and
reenforced
from
washington
in
view
of
the
final
struggle
the
situation
had
changed
since
the
trent
affair
the
work
was
efficiently
done
the
organization
was
fairly
complete
no
doubt
the
legation
itself
was
still
as
weakly
manned
and
had
as
poor
an
outfit
as
the
legations
of
guatemala
or
portugal
congress
was
always
jealous
of
its
diplomatic
service
and
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
foreign
relations
was
not
likely
to
press
assistance
on
the
minister
to
england
for
the
legation
not
an
additional
clerk
was
offered
or
asked
the
secretary
the
assistant
secretary
and
the
private
secretary
did
all
the
work
that
the
minister
did
not
do
a
clerk
at
five
dollars
a
week
would
have
done
the
work
as
well
or
better
but
the
minister
could
trust
no
clerk
without
express
authority
he
could
admit
no
one
into
the
legation
he
strained
a
point
already
by
admitting
his
son
congress
and
its
committees
were
the
proper
judges
of
what
was
best
for
the
public
service
and
if
the
arrangement
seemed
good
to
them
it
was
satisfactory
to
a
private
secretary
who
profited
by
it
more
than
they
did
a
great
staff
would
have
suppressed
him
the
whole
legation
was
a
sort
of
improvised
volunteer
service
and
he
was
a
volunteer
with
the
rest
he
was
rather
better
off
than
the
rest
because
he
was
invisible
and
unknown
better
or
worse
he
did
his
work
with
the
others
and
if
the
secretaries
made
any
remarks
about
congress
they
made
no
complaints
and
knew
that
none
would
have
received
a
moment
attention
if
they
were
not
satisfied
with
congress
they
were
satisfied
with
secretary
seward
without
appropriations
for
the
regular
service
he
had
done
great
things
for
its
support
if
the
minister
had
no
secretaries
he
had
a
staff
of
active
consuls
he
had
a
press
efficient
legal
support
and
a
swarm
of
social
allies
permeating
all
classes
all
he
needed
was
a
victory
in
the
field
and
secretary
stanton
undertook
that
part
of
diplomacy
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
cleared
the
board
and
at
the
end
of
july
minister
adams
was
ready
to
deal
with
earl
russell
or
lord
palmerston
or
gladstone
or
delane
or
any
one
else
who
stood
in
his
way
and
by
the
necessity
of
the
case
was
obliged
to
deal
with
all
of
them
shortly
even
before
the
military
climax
at
vicksburg
and
gettysburg
the
minister
had
been
compelled
to
begin
his
attack
but
this
was
history
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
the
private
secretary
copied
the
notes
into
his
private
books
and
that
was
all
the
share
he
had
in
the
matter
except
to
talk
in
private
no
more
volunteer
services
were
needed
the
volunteers
were
in
a
manner
sent
to
the
rear
the
movement
was
too
serious
for
skirmishing
all
that
a
secretary
could
hope
to
gain
from
the
affair
was
experience
and
knowledge
of
politics
he
had
a
chance
to
measure
the
motive
forces
of
men
their
qualities
of
character
their
foresight
their
tenacity
of
purpose
in
the
legation
no
great
confidence
was
felt
in
stopping
the
rams
whatever
the
reason
russell
seemed
immovable
had
his
efforts
for
intervention
in
september
been
known
to
the
legation
in
september
the
minister
must
surely
have
admitted
that
russell
had
from
the
first
meant
to
force
his
plan
of
intervention
on
his
colleagues
every
separate
step
since
april
led
to
this
final
coercion
although
russell
hostile
activity
of
was
still
secret
and
remained
secret
for
some
years
his
animus
seemed
to
be
made
clear
by
his
steady
refusal
to
stop
the
rebel
armaments
little
by
little
minister
adams
lost
hope
with
loss
of
hope
came
the
raising
of
tone
until
at
last
after
stripping
russell
of
every
rag
of
defence
and
excuse
he
closed
by
leaving
him
loaded
with
connivance
in
the
rebel
armaments
and
ended
by
the
famous
sentence
it
would
be
superfluous
in
me
to
point
out
to
your
lordship
that
this
is
war
what
the
minister
meant
by
this
remark
was
his
own
affair
what
the
private
secretary
understood
by
it
was
a
part
of
his
education
had
his
father
ordered
him
to
draft
an
explanatory
paragraph
to
expand
the
idea
as
he
grasped
it
he
would
have
continued
thus
it
would
be
superfluous
because
earl
russell
not
only
knows
it
already
but
has
meant
it
from
the
start
because
it
is
the
only
logical
and
necessary
consequence
of
his
unvarying
action
because
adams
is
not
pointing
out
to
him
that
is
war
but
is
pointing
it
out
to
the
world
to
complete
the
record
this
would
have
been
the
sense
in
which
the
private
secretary
copied
into
his
books
the
statement
with
which
without
passion
or
excitement
the
minister
announced
that
a
state
of
war
existed
to
his
copying
eye
as
clerk
the
words
though
on
the
extreme
verge
of
diplomatic
propriety
merely
stated
a
fact
without
novelty
fancy
or
rhetoric
the
fact
had
to
be
stated
in
order
to
make
clear
the
issue
the
war
was
russell
war
adams
only
accepted
it
russell
reply
to
this
note
of
september
reached
the
legation
on
september
announcing
at
last
to
the
anxious
secretaries
that
instructions
have
been
issued
which
will
prevent
the
departure
of
the
two
ironclad
vessels
from
liverpool
the
members
of
the
modest
legation
in
portland
place
accepted
it
as
grant
had
accepted
the
capitulation
of
vicksburg
the
private
secretary
conceived
that
as
secretary
stanton
had
struck
and
crushed
by
superior
weight
the
rebel
left
on
the
mississippi
so
secretary
seward
had
struck
and
crushed
the
rebel
right
in
england
and
he
never
felt
a
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
the
battle
though
minister
adams
should
stay
in
office
till
he
were
ninety
he
would
never
fight
another
campaign
of
life
and
death
like
this
and
though
the
private
secretary
should
covet
and
attain
every
office
in
the
gift
of
president
or
people
he
would
never
again
find
education
to
compare
with
the
alternative
of
this
struggle
in
london
as
it
had
racked
and
him
in
its
shifting
phases
but
its
practical
value
as
education
turned
on
his
correctness
of
judgment
in
measuring
the
men
and
their
forces
he
felt
respect
for
russell
as
for
palmerston
because
they
represented
traditional
england
and
an
english
policy
respectable
enough
in
itself
but
which
for
four
generations
every
adams
had
fought
and
exploited
as
the
chief
source
of
his
political
fortunes
as
he
understood
it
russell
had
followed
this
policy
steadily
ably
even
vigorously
and
had
brought
it
to
the
moment
of
execution
then
he
had
met
wills
stronger
than
his
own
and
after
persevering
to
the
last
possible
instant
had
been
beaten
lord
north
and
george
canning
had
a
like
experience
this
was
only
the
idea
of
a
boy
but
as
far
as
he
ever
knew
it
was
also
the
idea
of
his
government
for
once
the
volunteer
secretary
was
satisfied
with
his
government
commonly
the
of
a
secretary
private
or
public
depends
on
and
is
proportional
to
the
severity
of
his
criticism
but
in
this
case
the
english
campaign
seemed
to
him
as
creditable
to
the
state
department
as
the
vicksburg
campaign
to
the
war
department
and
more
decisive
it
was
well
planned
well
prepared
and
well
executed
he
could
never
discover
a
mistake
in
it
possibly
he
was
biassed
by
personal
interest
but
his
chief
reason
for
trusting
his
own
judgment
was
that
he
thought
himself
to
be
one
of
only
half
a
dozen
persons
who
knew
something
about
it
when
others
criticised
seward
he
was
rather
indifferent
to
their
opinions
because
he
thought
they
hardly
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
and
could
not
be
taught
without
living
over
again
the
london
life
of
to
him
secretary
seward
seemed
immensely
strong
and
steady
in
leadership
but
this
was
no
discredit
to
russell
or
palmerston
or
gladstone
they
too
had
shown
power
patience
and
steadiness
of
purpose
they
had
persisted
for
two
years
and
a
half
in
their
plan
for
breaking
up
the
union
and
had
yielded
at
last
only
in
the
jaws
of
war
after
a
long
and
desperate
struggle
the
american
minister
had
trumped
their
best
card
and
won
the
game
again
and
again
in
after
life
he
went
back
over
the
ground
to
see
whether
he
could
detect
error
on
either
side
he
found
none
at
every
stage
the
steps
were
both
probable
and
proved
all
the
more
he
was
disconcerted
that
russell
should
indignantly
and
with
growing
energy
to
his
dying
day
deny
and
resent
the
axiom
of
adams
whole
contention
that
from
the
first
he
meant
to
break
up
the
union
russell
affirmed
that
he
meant
nothing
of
the
sort
that
he
had
meant
nothing
at
all
that
he
meant
to
do
right
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
meant
driven
from
one
defence
after
another
he
pleaded
at
last
like
gladstone
that
he
had
no
defence
concealing
all
he
could
conceal
burying
in
profound
secrecy
his
attempt
to
break
up
the
union
in
the
autumn
of
he
affirmed
the
louder
his
scrupulous
good
faith
what
was
worse
for
the
private
secretary
to
the
total
derision
and
despair
of
the
lifelong
effort
for
education
as
the
final
result
of
combined
practice
experience
and
theory
he
proved
it
henry
adams
had
as
he
thought
suffered
too
much
from
russell
to
admit
any
plea
in
his
favor
but
he
came
to
doubt
whether
this
admission
really
favored
him
not
until
long
after
earl
russell
death
was
the
question
reopened
russell
had
quitted
office
in
he
died
in
the
biography
was
published
in
during
the
alabama
controversy
and
the
geneva
conference
in
his
course
as
foreign
secretary
had
been
sharply
criticised
and
he
had
been
compelled
to
see
england
pay
more
than
penalty
for
his
errors
on
the
other
hand
he
brought
forward
or
his
biographer
for
him
evidence
tending
to
prove
that
he
was
not
consciously
dishonest
and
that
he
had
in
spite
of
appearances
acted
without
collusion
agreement
plan
or
policy
as
far
as
concerned
the
rebels
he
had
stood
alone
as
was
his
nature
like
gladstone
he
had
thought
himself
right
in
the
end
russell
entangled
himself
in
a
hopeless
ball
of
admissions
denials
contradictions
and
resentments
which
led
even
his
old
colleagues
to
drop
his
defence
as
they
dropped
gladstone
but
this
was
not
enough
for
the
student
of
diplomacy
who
had
made
a
certain
theory
his
law
of
life
and
wanted
to
hold
russell
up
against
himself
to
show
that
he
had
foresight
and
persistence
of
which
he
was
unaware
the
effort
became
hopeless
when
the
biography
in
published
papers
which
upset
all
that
henry
adams
had
taken
for
diplomatic
education
yet
he
sat
down
once
more
when
past
sixty
years
old
to
see
whether
he
could
unravel
the
skein
of
the
obstinate
effort
to
bring
about
an
armed
intervention
on
the
lines
marked
out
by
russell
letter
to
palmerston
from
gotha
september
nothing
could
be
said
beyond
gladstone
plea
in
excuse
for
his
speech
in
pursuance
of
the
same
effort
that
it
was
the
most
singular
and
palpable
error
the
least
excusable
a
mistake
of
incredible
grossness
which
passed
defence
but
while
gladstone
threw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
public
for
his
speech
he
attempted
no
excuse
for
lord
russell
who
led
him
into
the
incredible
grossness
of
announcing
the
foreign
secretary
intent
gladstone
offence
singular
and
palpable
was
not
the
speech
alone
but
its
cause
the
policy
that
inspired
the
speech
i
weakly
supposed
i
really
though
most
strangely
believed
that
it
was
an
act
of
friendliness
whatever
absurdity
gladstone
supposed
russell
supposed
nothing
of
the
sort
neither
he
nor
palmerston
most
strangely
believed
in
any
proposition
so
obviously
and
palpably
absurd
nor
did
napoleon
delude
himself
with
philanthropy
gladstone
even
in
his
confession
mixed
up
policy
speech
motives
and
persons
as
though
he
were
trying
to
confuse
chiefly
himself
there
gladstone
activity
seems
to
have
stopped
he
did
not
reappear
in
the
matter
of
the
rams
the
rebel
influence
shrank
in
as
far
as
is
known
to
lord
russell
alone
who
wrote
on
september
that
he
could
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
those
vessels
and
thereby
brought
on
himself
adams
declaration
of
war
on
september
a
student
held
that
in
this
refusal
he
was
merely
following
his
policy
of
september
and
of
every
step
he
had
taken
since
the
student
was
wrong
russell
proved
that
he
had
been
feeble
timid
mistaken
senile
but
not
dishonest
the
evidence
is
convincing
the
lairds
had
built
these
ships
in
reliance
on
the
known
opinion
of
the
that
the
statute
did
not
apply
and
a
jury
would
not
convict
minister
adams
replied
that
in
this
case
the
statute
should
be
amended
or
the
ships
stopped
by
exercise
of
the
political
power
bethell
rejoined
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
neutrality
one
must
preserve
the
status
quo
tacitly
russell
connived
with
laird
and
had
he
meant
to
interfere
he
was
bound
to
warn
laird
that
the
defect
of
the
statute
would
no
longer
protect
him
but
he
allowed
the
builders
to
go
on
till
the
ships
were
ready
for
sea
then
on
september
two
days
before
adams
superfluous
letter
he
wrote
to
lord
palmerston
begging
for
help
the
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
contracted
for
the
two
ironclads
at
birkenhead
is
so
very
suspicious
he
began
and
this
he
actually
wrote
in
good
faith
and
deep
confidence
to
lord
palmerston
his
chief
calling
the
conduct
of
the
rebel
agents
suspicious
when
no
one
else
in
europe
or
america
felt
any
suspicion
about
it
because
the
whole
question
turned
not
on
the
rams
but
on
the
technical
scope
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
that
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
direct
that
they
should
be
detained
not
of
course
under
the
statute
but
on
the
ground
urged
by
the
american
minister
of
international
obligation
above
the
statute
the
solicitor
general
has
been
consulted
and
concurs
in
the
measure
as
one
of
policy
though
not
of
strict
law
we
shall
thus
test
the
law
and
if
we
have
to
pay
damages
we
have
satisfied
the
opinion
which
prevails
here
as
well
as
in
america
that
that
kind
of
neutral
hostility
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
without
some
attempt
to
stop
it
for
naivete
that
would
be
unusual
in
an
unpaid
attache
of
legation
this
sudden
leap
from
his
own
to
his
opponent
ground
after
two
years
and
a
half
of
dogged
resistance
might
have
roused
palmerston
to
inhuman
scorn
but
instead
of
derision
well
earned
by
russell
old
attacks
on
himself
palmerston
met
the
appeal
with
wonderful
loyalty
on
consulting
the
law
officers
he
found
that
there
was
no
lawful
ground
for
meddling
with
the
ironclads
or
in
unprofessional
language
that
he
could
trust
neither
his
law
officers
nor
a
liverpool
jury
and
therefore
he
suggested
buying
the
ships
for
the
british
navy
as
proof
of
criminal
negligence
in
the
past
this
suggestion
seemed
decisive
but
russell
by
this
time
was
floundering
in
other
troubles
of
negligence
for
he
had
neglected
to
notify
the
american
minister
he
should
have
done
so
at
once
on
september
instead
he
waited
till
september
and
then
merely
said
that
the
matter
was
under
serious
and
anxious
consideration
this
note
did
not
reach
the
legation
till
three
on
the
afternoon
of
september
after
the
superfluous
declaration
of
war
had
been
sent
thus
lord
russell
had
sacrificed
the
lairds
had
cost
his
ministry
the
price
of
two
ironclads
besides
the
alabama
claims
say
in
round
numbers
twenty
million
dollars
and
had
put
himself
in
the
position
of
appearing
to
yield
only
to
a
threat
of
war
finally
he
wrote
to
the
admiralty
a
letter
which
from
the
american
point
of
view
would
have
sounded
youthful
from
an
eton
schoolboy
september
my
dear
duke
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
urgency
that
the
ironclads
building
at
birkenhead
should
not
go
to
america
to
break
the
blockade
they
belong
to
monsieur
bravay
of
paris
if
you
will
offer
to
buy
them
on
the
part
of
the
admiralty
you
will
get
money
worth
if
he
accepts
your
offer
and
if
he
does
not
it
will
be
presumptive
proof
that
they
are
already
bought
by
the
confederates
i
should
state
that
we
have
suggested
to
the
turkish
government
to
buy
them
but
you
can
easily
settle
that
matter
with
the
turks
the
hilarity
of
the
secretaries
in
portland
place
would
have
been
loud
had
they
seen
this
letter
and
realized
the
muddle
of
difficulties
into
which
earl
russell
had
at
last
thrown
himself
under
the
impulse
of
the
american
minister
but
nevertheless
these
letters
upset
from
top
to
bottom
the
results
of
the
private
diplomatic
education
forty
years
after
he
had
supposed
it
complete
they
made
a
picture
different
from
anything
he
had
conceived
and
rendered
worthless
his
whole
painful
diplomatic
experience
to
reconstruct
when
past
sixty
an
education
useful
for
any
practical
purpose
is
no
practical
problem
and
adams
saw
no
use
in
attacking
it
as
only
theoretical
he
no
longer
cared
whether
he
understood
human
nature
or
not
he
understood
quite
as
much
of
it
as
he
wanted
but
he
found
in
the
life
of
gladstone
ii
a
remark
several
times
repeated
that
gave
him
matter
for
curious
thought
i
always
hold
said
gladstone
that
politicians
are
the
men
whom
as
a
rule
it
is
most
difficult
to
comprehend
and
he
added
by
way
of
strengthening
it
for
my
own
part
i
never
have
thus
understood
or
thought
i
understood
above
one
or
two
earl
russell
was
certainly
not
one
of
the
two
henry
adams
thought
he
also
had
understood
one
or
two
but
the
american
type
was
more
familiar
perhaps
this
was
the
sufficient
result
of
his
diplomatic
education
it
seemed
to
be
the
whole
chapter
xii
eccentricity
knowledge
of
human
nature
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
political
education
but
several
years
of
arduous
study
in
the
neighborhood
of
westminster
led
henry
adams
to
think
that
knowledge
of
english
human
nature
had
little
or
no
value
outside
of
england
in
paris
such
a
habit
stood
in
one
way
in
america
it
roused
all
the
instincts
of
native
jealousy
the
english
mind
was
eccentric
systematically
unsystematic
and
logically
illogical
the
less
one
knew
of
it
the
better
this
heresy
which
scarcely
would
have
been
allowed
to
penetrate
a
boston
mind
it
would
indeed
have
been
shut
out
by
instinct
as
a
rather
foolish
exaggeration
rested
on
an
experience
which
henry
adams
gravely
thought
he
had
a
right
to
think
conclusive
for
him
that
it
should
be
conclusive
for
any
one
else
never
occurred
to
him
since
he
had
no
thought
of
educating
anybody
else
for
him
alone
the
less
english
education
he
got
the
better
for
several
years
under
the
keenest
incitement
to
watchfulness
he
observed
the
english
mind
in
contact
with
itself
and
other
minds
especially
with
the
american
the
contact
was
interesting
because
the
limits
and
defects
of
the
american
mind
were
one
of
the
favorite
topics
of
the
european
from
the
point
of
view
the
american
had
no
mind
he
had
an
economic
which
could
work
only
on
a
fixed
line
the
american
mind
exasperated
the
european
as
a
might
exasperate
a
pine
forest
the
english
mind
disliked
the
french
mind
because
it
was
antagonistic
unreasonable
perhaps
hostile
but
recognized
it
as
at
least
a
thought
the
american
mind
was
not
a
thought
at
all
it
was
a
convention
superficial
narrow
and
ignorant
a
mere
cutting
instrument
practical
economical
sharp
and
direct
the
english
themselves
hardly
conceived
that
their
mind
was
either
economical
sharp
or
direct
but
the
defect
that
most
struck
an
american
was
its
enormous
waste
in
eccentricity
americans
needed
and
used
their
whole
energy
and
applied
it
with
close
economy
but
english
society
was
eccentric
by
law
and
for
sake
of
the
eccentricity
itself
the
commonest
phrase
overheard
at
an
english
club
or
was
that
is
quite
mad
it
was
no
offence
to
it
hardly
distinguished
him
from
his
fellows
and
when
applied
to
a
public
man
like
gladstone
it
was
qualified
by
epithets
much
more
forcible
eccentricity
was
so
general
as
to
become
hereditary
distinction
it
made
the
chief
charm
of
english
society
as
well
as
its
chief
terror
the
american
delighted
in
thackeray
as
a
satirist
but
thackeray
quite
justly
maintained
that
he
was
not
a
satirist
at
all
and
that
his
pictures
of
english
society
were
exact
and
the
american
who
could
not
believe
it
fell
back
on
dickens
who
at
all
events
had
the
vice
of
exaggeration
to
extravagance
but
english
audience
thought
the
exaggeration
rather
in
manner
or
style
than
in
types
gladstone
himself
went
to
see
sothern
act
dundreary
and
laughed
till
his
face
was
distorted
not
because
dundreary
was
exaggerated
but
because
he
was
ridiculously
like
the
types
that
gladstone
had
seen
or
might
have
seen
in
any
club
in
pall
mall
society
swarmed
with
exaggerated
characters
it
contained
little
else
often
this
eccentricity
bore
all
the
marks
of
strength
perhaps
it
was
actual
exuberance
of
force
a
birthmark
of
genius
boston
thought
so
the
bostonian
called
it
national
character
native
vigor
robustness
honesty
courage
he
respected
and
feared
it
british
bluff
brutal
blunt
as
it
was
seemed
to
him
a
better
and
nobler
thing
than
the
acuteness
of
the
yankee
or
the
polish
of
the
parisian
perhaps
he
was
right
these
questions
of
taste
of
feeling
of
inheritance
need
no
settlement
every
one
carries
his
own
of
taste
and
amuses
himself
by
applying
it
triumphantly
wherever
he
travels
whatever
others
thought
the
cleverest
englishmen
held
that
the
national
eccentricity
needed
correction
and
were
beginning
to
correct
it
the
savage
satires
of
dickens
and
the
gentler
ridicule
of
matthew
arnold
against
the
british
middle
class
were
but
a
part
of
the
rebellion
for
the
middle
class
were
no
worse
than
their
neighbors
in
the
eyes
of
an
american
in
they
were
even
a
very
little
better
in
the
sense
that
one
could
appeal
to
their
interests
while
a
university
man
like
gladstone
stood
outside
of
argument
from
none
of
them
could
a
young
american
afford
to
borrow
ideas
the
private
secretary
like
every
other
bostonian
began
by
regarding
british
eccentricity
as
a
force
contact
with
it
in
the
shape
of
palmerston
russell
and
gladstone
made
him
hesitate
he
saw
his
own
national
type
his
father
weed
evarts
for
instance
deal
with
the
british
and
show
itself
certainly
not
the
weaker
certainly
sometimes
the
stronger
biassed
though
he
were
he
could
hardly
be
biassed
to
such
a
degree
as
to
mistake
the
effects
of
force
on
others
and
while
labor
as
he
might
earl
russell
and
his
state
papers
seemed
weak
to
a
secretary
he
could
not
see
that
they
seemed
strong
to
russell
own
followers
russell
might
be
dishonest
or
he
might
be
merely
obtuse
the
english
type
might
be
brutal
or
might
be
only
stupid
but
strong
in
either
case
it
was
not
nor
did
it
seem
strong
to
englishmen
eccentricity
was
not
always
a
force
americans
were
deeply
interested
in
deciding
whether
it
was
always
a
weakness
evidently
on
the
hustings
or
in
parliament
among
eccentricities
eccentricity
was
at
home
but
in
private
society
the
question
was
not
easy
to
answer
that
english
society
was
infinitely
more
amusing
because
of
its
eccentricities
no
one
denied
barring
the
atrocious
insolence
and
brutality
which
englishmen
and
especially
englishwomen
showed
to
each
other
very
rarely
indeed
to
foreigners
english
society
was
much
more
easy
and
tolerant
than
american
one
must
expect
to
be
treated
with
exquisite
courtesy
this
week
and
be
totally
forgotten
the
next
but
this
was
the
way
of
the
world
and
education
consisted
in
learning
to
turn
one
back
on
others
with
the
same
unconscious
indifference
that
others
showed
among
themselves
the
smart
of
wounded
vanity
lasted
no
long
time
with
a
young
man
about
town
who
had
little
vanity
to
smart
and
who
in
his
own
country
would
have
found
himself
in
no
better
position
he
had
nothing
to
complain
of
no
one
was
ever
brutal
to
him
on
the
contrary
he
was
much
better
treated
than
ever
he
was
likely
to
be
in
boston
let
alone
new
york
or
washington
and
if
his
reception
varied
inconceivably
between
extreme
courtesy
and
extreme
neglect
it
merely
proved
that
he
had
become
or
was
becoming
at
home
not
from
a
sense
of
personal
griefs
or
disappointments
did
he
labor
over
this
part
of
the
social
problem
but
only
because
his
education
was
becoming
english
and
the
further
it
went
the
less
it
promised
by
natural
affinity
the
social
eccentrics
commonly
sympathized
with
political
eccentricity
the
english
mind
took
naturally
to
rebellion
when
foreign
and
it
felt
particular
confidence
in
the
southern
confederacy
because
of
its
combined
attributes
foreign
rebellion
of
english
blood
which
came
nearer
ideal
eccentricity
than
could
be
reached
by
poles
hungarians
italians
or
frenchmen
all
the
english
eccentrics
rushed
into
the
ranks
of
rebel
sympathizers
leaving
few
but
minds
to
attach
themselves
to
the
cause
of
the
union
none
of
the
english
leaders
on
the
northern
side
were
marked
eccentrics
william
forster
was
a
practical
yorkshireman
whose
chief
ideals
in
politics
took
shape
as
working
arrangements
on
an
economical
base
cobden
considering
the
conditions
of
his
life
was
remarkably
well
balanced
john
bright
was
stronger
in
his
expressions
than
either
of
them
but
with
all
his
he
stuck
to
his
point
and
his
point
was
practical
he
did
not
like
gladstone
box
the
compass
of
thought
furiously
earnest
as
monckton
milnes
said
on
both
sides
of
every
question
he
was
rather
on
the
whole
a
consistent
conservative
of
the
old
commonwealth
type
and
seldom
had
to
defend
inconsistencies
monckton
milnes
himself
was
regarded
as
an
eccentric
chiefly
by
those
who
did
not
know
him
but
his
fancies
and
hobbies
were
only
ideas
a
little
in
advance
of
the
time
his
manner
was
eccentric
but
not
his
mind
as
any
one
could
see
who
read
a
page
of
his
poetry
none
of
them
except
milnes
was
a
university
man
as
a
rule
the
legation
was
troubled
very
little
if
at
all
by
indiscretions
extravagances
or
contradictions
among
its
english
friends
their
work
was
largely
judicious
practical
well
considered
and
almost
too
cautious
the
cranks
were
all
rebels
and
the
list
was
portentous
perhaps
it
might
be
headed
by
old
lord
brougham
who
had
the
audacity
to
appear
at
a
july
reception
at
the
legation
led
by
joe
parkes
and
claim
his
old
credit
as
attorney
general
to
mr
madison
the
church
was
rebel
but
the
dissenters
were
mostly
with
the
union
the
universities
were
rebel
but
the
university
men
who
enjoyed
most
public
confidence
like
lord
granville
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
lord
stanley
sir
george
grey
took
infinite
pains
to
be
neutral
for
fear
of
being
thought
eccentric
to
most
observers
as
well
as
to
the
times
the
morning
post
and
the
standard
a
vast
majority
of
the
english
people
seemed
to
follow
the
professional
eccentrics
even
the
emotional
philanthropists
took
that
direction
lord
shaftesbury
and
carlyle
fowell
buxton
and
gladstone
threw
their
sympathies
on
the
side
which
they
should
naturally
have
opposed
and
did
so
for
no
reason
except
their
eccentricity
but
the
canny
scots
and
yorkshiremen
were
cautious
this
eccentricity
did
not
mean
strength
the
proof
of
it
was
the
mismanagement
of
the
rebel
interests
no
doubt
the
first
cause
of
this
trouble
lay
in
the
richmond
government
itself
no
one
understood
why
jefferson
davis
chose
mason
as
his
agent
for
london
at
the
same
time
that
he
made
so
good
a
choice
as
slidell
for
paris
the
confederacy
had
plenty
of
excellent
men
to
send
to
london
but
few
who
were
less
fitted
than
mason
possibly
mason
had
a
certain
amount
of
common
sense
but
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
else
and
in
london
society
he
counted
merely
as
one
eccentric
more
he
enjoyed
a
great
opportunity
he
might
even
have
figured
as
a
new
benjamin
franklin
with
all
society
at
his
feet
he
might
have
roared
as
lion
of
the
season
and
made
the
social
path
of
the
american
minister
almost
impassable
but
adams
had
his
usual
luck
in
enemies
who
were
always
his
most
valuable
allies
if
his
friends
only
let
them
alone
mason
was
his
greatest
diplomatic
triumph
he
had
his
collision
with
palmerston
he
drove
russell
off
the
field
he
swept
the
board
before
cockburn
he
overbore
slidell
but
he
never
lifted
a
finger
against
mason
who
became
his
bulwark
of
defence
possibly
jefferson
davis
and
mason
shared
two
defects
in
common
which
might
have
led
them
into
this
serious
mistake
neither
could
have
had
much
knowledge
of
the
world
and
both
must
have
been
unconscious
of
humor
yet
at
the
same
time
with
mason
president
davis
sent
out
slidell
to
france
and
lamar
to
russia
some
twenty
years
later
in
the
shifting
search
for
the
education
he
never
found
adams
became
closely
intimate
at
washington
with
lamar
then
senator
from
mississippi
who
had
grown
to
be
one
of
the
calmest
most
reasonable
and
most
amiable
union
men
in
the
united
states
and
quite
unusual
in
social
charm
in
he
passed
for
the
worst
of
southern
but
he
was
an
eccentric
by
environment
not
by
nature
above
all
his
southern
eccentricities
he
had
tact
and
humor
and
perhaps
this
was
a
reason
why
davis
sent
him
abroad
with
the
others
on
a
futile
mission
to
petersburg
he
would
have
done
better
in
london
in
place
of
mason
london
society
would
have
delighted
in
him
his
stories
would
have
won
success
his
manners
would
have
made
him
loved
his
oratory
would
have
swept
every
audience
even
monckton
milnes
could
never
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
having
him
to
breakfast
between
lord
shaftesbury
and
the
bishop
of
oxford
lamar
liked
to
talk
of
his
brief
career
in
diplomacy
but
he
never
spoke
of
mason
he
never
alluded
to
confederate
management
or
criticised
jefferson
davis
administration
the
subject
that
amused
him
was
his
english
allies
at
that
moment
the
early
summer
of
the
rebel
party
in
england
were
full
of
confidence
and
felt
strong
enough
to
challenge
the
american
legation
to
a
show
of
power
they
knew
better
than
the
legation
what
they
could
depend
upon
that
the
law
officers
and
commissioners
of
customs
at
liverpool
dared
not
prosecute
the
ironclad
ships
that
palmerston
russell
and
gladstone
were
ready
to
recognize
the
confederacy
that
the
emperor
napoleon
would
offer
them
every
inducement
to
do
it
in
a
manner
they
owned
liverpool
and
especially
the
firm
of
laird
who
were
building
their
ships
the
political
member
of
the
laird
firm
was
lindsay
about
whom
the
whole
web
of
rebel
interests
clung
rams
cruisers
munitions
and
confederate
loan
social
introductions
and
parliamentary
tactics
the
firm
of
laird
with
a
certain
dignity
claimed
to
be
champion
of
england
navy
and
public
opinion
in
the
summer
of
still
inclined
towards
them
never
was
there
a
moment
when
eccentricity
if
it
were
a
force
should
have
had
more
value
to
the
rebel
interest
and
the
managers
must
have
thought
so
for
they
adopted
or
accepted
as
their
champion
an
eccentric
of
eccentrics
a
type
of
a
sort
of
brougham
of
sheffield
notorious
for
poor
judgment
and
worse
temper
roebuck
had
been
a
tribune
of
the
people
and
like
tribunes
of
most
other
peoples
in
growing
old
had
grown
fatuous
he
was
regarded
by
the
friends
of
the
union
as
rather
a
comical
personage
a
favorite
subject
for
punch
to
laugh
at
with
a
bitter
tongue
and
a
mind
enfeebled
even
more
than
common
by
the
political
epidemic
of
egotism
in
all
england
they
could
have
found
no
opponent
better
fitted
to
give
away
his
own
case
no
american
man
of
business
would
have
paid
him
attention
yet
the
lairds
who
certainly
knew
their
own
affairs
best
let
roebuck
represent
them
and
take
charge
of
their
interests
with
roebuck
doings
the
private
secretary
had
no
concern
except
that
the
minister
sent
him
down
to
the
house
of
commons
on
june
to
report
the
result
of
roebuck
motion
to
recognize
the
southern
confederacy
the
legation
felt
no
anxiety
having
vicksburg
already
in
its
pocket
and
bright
and
forster
to
say
so
but
the
private
secretary
went
down
and
was
admitted
under
the
gallery
on
the
left
to
listen
with
great
content
while
john
bright
with
astonishing
force
caught
and
shook
and
tossed
roebuck
as
a
big
mastiff
shakes
a
wiry
toothless
yorkshire
terrier
the
private
secretary
felt
an
artistic
sympathy
with
roebuck
for
from
time
to
time
by
way
of
practice
bright
in
a
friendly
way
was
apt
to
shake
him
too
and
he
knew
how
it
was
done
the
manner
counted
for
more
than
the
words
the
scene
was
interesting
but
the
result
was
not
in
doubt
all
the
more
sharply
he
was
excited
near
the
year
in
washington
by
hearing
lamar
begin
a
story
after
dinner
which
little
by
little
became
dramatic
recalling
the
scene
in
the
house
of
commons
the
story
as
well
as
one
remembered
began
with
failure
to
reach
petersburg
at
all
and
his
consequent
detention
in
paris
waiting
instructions
the
motion
to
recognize
the
confederacy
was
about
to
be
made
and
in
prospect
of
the
debate
lindsay
collected
a
party
at
his
villa
on
the
thames
to
bring
the
rebel
agents
into
relations
with
roebuck
lamar
was
sent
for
and
came
after
much
conversation
of
a
general
sort
such
as
is
the
usual
object
or
resource
of
the
english
sunday
finding
himself
alone
with
roebuck
lamar
by
way
of
showing
interest
bethought
himself
of
john
bright
and
asked
roebuck
whether
he
expected
bright
to
take
part
in
the
debate
no
sir
said
roebuck
sententiously
bright
and
i
have
met
before
it
was
the
old
story
the
story
of
the
and
the
whale
no
sir
mr
bright
will
not
cross
swords
with
me
again
thus
assured
lamar
went
with
the
more
confidence
to
the
house
on
the
appointed
evening
and
was
placed
under
the
gallery
on
the
right
where
he
listened
to
roebuck
and
followed
the
debate
with
such
enjoyment
as
an
experienced
debater
feels
in
these
contests
until
as
he
said
he
became
aware
that
a
man
with
a
singularly
rich
voice
and
imposing
manner
had
taken
the
floor
and
was
giving
roebuck
the
most
deliberate
and
tremendous
pounding
he
ever
witnessed
until
at
last
concluded
lamar
it
dawned
on
my
mind
that
the
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
lamar
told
the
story
in
the
spirit
of
a
joke
against
himself
rather
than
against
roebuck
but
such
jokes
must
have
been
unpleasantly
common
in
the
experience
of
the
rebel
agents
they
were
surrounded
by
cranks
of
the
worst
english
species
who
distorted
their
natural
eccentricities
and
perverted
their
judgment
roebuck
may
have
been
an
extreme
case
since
he
was
actually
in
his
dotage
yet
this
did
not
prevent
the
lairds
from
accepting
his
lead
or
the
house
from
taking
him
seriously
extreme
eccentricity
was
no
bar
in
england
to
extreme
confidence
sometimes
it
seemed
a
recommendation
and
unless
it
caused
financial
loss
it
rather
helped
popularity
the
question
whether
british
eccentricity
was
ever
strength
weighed
heavily
in
the
balance
of
education
that
roebuck
should
mislead
the
rebel
agents
on
so
strange
a
point
as
that
of
courage
was
doubly
characteristic
because
the
southern
people
themselves
had
this
same
barbaric
weakness
of
attributing
want
of
courage
to
opponents
and
owed
their
ruin
chiefly
to
such
ignorance
of
the
world
bright
courage
was
almost
as
irrational
as
that
of
the
rebels
themselves
every
one
knew
that
he
had
the
courage
of
a
he
struck
in
succession
pretty
nearly
every
man
in
england
that
could
be
reached
by
a
blow
and
when
he
could
not
reach
the
individual
he
struck
the
class
or
when
the
class
was
too
small
for
him
the
whole
people
of
england
at
times
he
had
the
whole
country
on
his
back
he
could
not
act
on
the
defensive
his
mind
required
attack
even
among
friends
at
the
he
talked
as
though
he
were
denouncing
them
or
someone
else
on
a
platform
he
measured
his
phrases
built
his
sentences
cumulated
his
effects
and
pounded
his
opponents
real
or
imagined
his
humor
was
glow
like
iron
at
dull
heat
his
blow
was
elementary
like
the
thrash
of
a
whale
one
day
in
early
spring
march
the
minister
requested
his
private
secretary
to
attend
a
meeting
at
hall
which
was
the
result
of
professor
beesly
patient
efforts
to
unite
bright
and
the
on
an
american
platform
the
secretary
went
to
the
meeting
and
made
a
report
which
reposes
somewhere
on
file
in
the
state
department
to
this
day
as
harmless
as
such
reports
should
be
but
it
contained
no
mention
of
what
interested
young
adams
most
bright
psychology
with
singular
skill
and
oratorical
power
bright
managed
at
the
outset
in
his
opening
paragraph
to
insult
or
outrage
every
class
of
englishman
commonly
considered
respectable
and
for
fear
of
any
escaping
he
insulted
them
repeatedly
under
consecutive
heads
the
rhetorical
effect
was
tremendous
privilege
thinks
it
has
a
great
interest
in
the
american
contest
he
began
in
his
massive
deliberate
tones
and
every
morning
with
blatant
voice
it
comes
into
our
streets
and
curses
the
american
republic
privilege
has
beheld
an
afflicting
spectacle
for
many
years
past
it
has
beheld
thirty
million
of
men
happy
and
prosperous
without
emperors
without
king
cheers
without
the
surroundings
of
a
court
renewed
cheers
without
nobles
except
such
as
are
made
by
eminence
in
intellect
and
virtue
without
state
bishops
and
state
priests
those
vendors
of
the
love
that
works
salvation
cheers
without
great
armies
and
great
navies
without
a
great
debt
and
great
taxes
and
privilege
has
shuddered
at
what
might
happen
to
old
europe
if
this
great
experiment
should
succeed
an
ingenious
man
with
an
inventive
mind
might
have
managed
in
the
same
number
of
lines
to
offend
more
englishmen
than
bright
struck
in
this
sentence
but
he
must
have
betrayed
artifice
and
hurt
his
oratory
the
audience
cheered
furiously
and
the
private
secretary
felt
peace
in
his
much
troubled
mind
for
he
knew
how
careful
the
ministry
would
be
once
they
saw
bright
talk
republican
principles
before
but
while
he
did
not
like
roebuck
see
reason
to
doubt
the
courage
of
a
man
who
after
quarrelling
with
the
quarreled
with
all
the
world
outside
the
he
did
feel
a
doubt
whether
to
class
bright
as
eccentric
or
conventional
every
one
called
bright
from
lord
palmerston
to
william
forster
but
to
an
american
he
seemed
more
english
than
any
of
his
critics
he
was
a
liberal
hater
and
what
he
hated
he
reviled
after
the
manner
of
milton
but
he
was
afraid
of
no
one
he
was
almost
the
only
man
in
england
or
for
that
matter
in
europe
who
hated
palmerston
and
was
not
afraid
of
him
or
of
the
press
or
the
pulpit
the
clubs
or
the
bench
that
stood
behind
him
he
loathed
the
whole
fabric
of
sham
religion
sham
loyalty
sham
aristocracy
and
sham
socialism
he
had
the
british
weakness
of
believing
only
in
himself
and
his
own
conventions
in
all
this
an
american
saw
if
one
may
make
the
distinction
much
racial
eccentricity
but
little
that
was
personal
bright
was
singularly
well
poised
but
he
used
singularly
strong
language
long
afterwards
in
adams
happened
to
be
living
again
in
london
for
a
season
when
james
russell
lowell
was
transferred
there
as
minister
and
as
adams
relations
with
lowell
had
become
closer
and
more
intimate
with
years
he
wanted
the
new
minister
to
know
some
of
his
old
friends
bright
was
then
in
the
cabinet
and
no
longer
the
most
radical
member
even
there
but
he
was
still
a
rare
figure
in
society
he
came
to
dinner
along
with
sir
francis
doyle
and
sir
robert
cunliffe
and
as
usual
did
most
of
the
talking
as
usual
also
he
talked
of
the
things
most
on
his
mind
apparently
it
must
have
been
some
reform
of
the
criminal
law
which
the
judges
opposed
that
excited
him
for
at
the
end
of
dinner
over
the
wine
he
took
possession
of
the
table
in
his
old
way
and
ended
with
a
superb
denunciation
of
the
bench
spoken
in
his
massive
manner
as
though
every
word
were
a
hammer
smashing
what
it
struck
for
two
hundred
years
the
judges
of
england
sat
on
the
bench
condemning
to
the
penalty
of
death
every
man
woman
and
child
who
stole
property
to
the
value
of
five
shillings
and
during
all
that
time
not
one
judge
ever
remonstrated
against
the
law
we
english
are
a
nation
of
brutes
and
ought
to
be
exterminated
to
the
last
man
as
the
party
rose
from
table
and
passed
into
the
adams
said
to
lowell
that
bright
was
very
fine
yes
replied
lowell
but
too
violent
precisely
this
was
the
point
that
adams
doubted
bright
knew
his
englishmen
better
than
lowell
did
better
than
england
did
he
knew
what
amount
of
violence
in
language
was
necessary
to
drive
an
idea
into
a
lancashire
or
yorkshire
head
he
knew
that
no
violence
was
enough
to
affect
a
somersetshire
or
wiltshire
peasant
bright
kept
his
own
head
cool
and
clear
he
was
not
excited
he
never
betrayed
excitement
as
for
his
denunciation
of
the
english
bench
it
was
a
very
old
story
not
original
with
him
that
the
english
were
a
nation
of
brutes
was
a
commonplace
generally
admitted
by
englishmen
and
universally
accepted
by
foreigners
while
the
matter
of
their
extermination
could
be
treated
only
as
unpractical
on
their
deserts
because
they
were
probably
not
very
much
worse
than
their
neighbors
had
bright
said
that
the
french
spaniards
germans
or
russians
were
a
nation
of
brutes
and
ought
to
be
exterminated
no
one
would
have
found
fault
the
whole
human
race
according
to
the
highest
authority
has
been
exterminated
once
already
for
the
same
reason
and
only
the
rainbow
protects
them
from
a
repetition
of
it
what
shocked
lowell
was
that
he
denounced
his
own
people
adams
felt
no
moral
obligation
to
defend
judges
who
as
far
as
he
knew
were
the
only
class
of
society
specially
adapted
to
defend
themselves
but
he
was
curious
even
anxious
as
a
point
of
education
to
decide
for
himself
whether
bright
language
was
violent
for
its
purpose
he
thought
not
perhaps
cobden
did
better
by
persuasion
but
that
was
another
matter
of
course
even
englishmen
sometimes
complained
of
being
so
constantly
told
that
they
were
brutes
and
hypocrites
although
they
were
told
little
else
by
their
censors
and
bore
it
on
the
whole
meekly
but
the
fact
that
it
was
true
in
the
main
troubled
the
voter
much
less
than
it
troubled
newman
gladstone
ruskin
carlyle
and
matthew
arnold
bright
was
personally
disliked
by
his
victims
but
not
distrusted
they
never
doubted
what
he
would
do
next
as
they
did
with
john
russell
gladstone
and
disraeli
he
betrayed
no
one
and
he
never
advanced
an
opinion
in
practical
matters
which
did
not
prove
to
be
practical
the
class
of
englishmen
who
set
out
to
be
the
intellectual
opposites
of
bright
seemed
to
an
american
bystander
the
weakest
and
most
eccentric
of
all
these
were
the
trimmers
the
political
economists
the
and
doctrinaire
class
the
followers
of
de
tocqueville
and
of
john
stuart
mill
as
a
class
they
were
timid
with
good
reason
and
timidity
which
is
high
wisdom
in
philosophy
sicklies
the
whole
cast
of
thought
in
action
numbers
of
these
men
haunted
london
society
all
tending
to
but
never
venturing
much
freedom
of
thought
like
the
doctrinaires
of
the
forties
and
fifties
they
became
mute
and
useless
when
slavery
struck
them
in
the
face
for
type
of
these
eccentrics
literature
seems
to
have
chosen
henry
reeve
at
least
to
the
extent
of
biography
he
was
a
bulky
figure
in
society
always
friendly
obliging
and
useful
almost
as
universal
as
milnes
and
more
busy
as
editor
of
the
edinburgh
review
he
had
authority
and
even
power
although
the
review
and
the
whole
whig
doctrinaire
school
had
begun
as
the
french
say
to
date
and
of
course
the
literary
and
artistic
sharpshooters
of
like
frank
palgrave
frothed
and
foamed
at
the
mere
mention
of
reeve
name
of
their
fury
was
due
only
to
his
ponderous
manner
london
society
abused
its
rights
of
personal
criticism
by
fixing
on
every
too
conspicuous
figure
some
word
or
phrase
that
stuck
to
it
every
one
had
heard
of
grote
as
the
origin
of
the
word
grotesque
every
one
had
laughed
at
the
story
of
reeve
approaching
grote
with
his
usual
somewhat
florid
manner
asking
in
his
literary
dialect
how
her
husband
the
historian
was
and
how
is
the
learned
grotius
pretty
well
thank
you
puffendorf
one
winced
at
the
word
as
though
it
were
a
drawing
of
forain
no
one
would
have
been
more
shocked
than
reeve
had
he
been
charged
with
want
of
moral
courage
he
proved
his
courage
afterwards
by
publishing
the
greville
memoirs
braving
the
displeasure
of
the
queen
yet
the
edinburgh
review
and
its
editor
avoided
taking
sides
except
where
sides
were
already
fixed
americanism
would
have
been
bad
form
in
the
liberal
edinburgh
review
it
would
have
seemed
eccentric
even
for
a
scotchman
and
reeve
was
a
saxon
of
saxons
to
an
american
this
attitude
of
oscillating
reserve
seemed
more
eccentric
than
the
reckless
hostility
of
brougham
or
carlyle
and
more
mischievous
for
he
never
could
be
sure
what
preposterous
commonplace
it
might
encourage
the
sum
of
these
experiences
in
left
the
conviction
that
eccentricity
was
weakness
the
young
american
who
should
adopt
english
thought
was
lost
from
the
facts
the
conclusion
was
correct
yet
as
usual
the
conclusion
was
wrong
the
years
of
palmerston
last
cabinet
to
were
avowedly
years
of
truce
of
arrested
development
the
british
system
like
the
french
was
in
its
last
stage
of
decomposition
never
had
the
british
mind
shown
itself
so
decousu
so
unravelled
at
sea
floundering
in
every
sort
of
historical
shipwreck
eccentricities
had
a
free
field
contradictions
swarmed
in
state
and
church
england
devoted
thirty
years
of
arduous
labor
to
clearing
away
only
a
part
of
the
debris
a
young
american
in
could
see
little
or
nothing
of
the
future
he
might
dream
but
he
could
not
foretell
the
suddenness
with
which
the
old
europe
with
england
in
its
wake
was
to
vanish
in
he
was
in
and
the
fantastic
cranks
swam
about
his
boat
as
though
he
were
the
ancient
mariner
and
they
saurians
of
the
prime
chapter
xiii
the
perfection
of
human
society
minister
adams
success
in
stopping
the
rebel
rams
fixed
his
position
once
for
all
in
english
society
from
that
moment
he
could
afford
to
drop
the
character
of
diplomatist
and
assume
what
for
an
american
minister
in
london
was
an
exclusive
diplomatic
advantage
the
character
of
a
kind
of
american
peer
of
the
realm
the
british
never
did
things
by
halves
once
they
recognized
a
man
right
to
social
privileges
they
accepted
him
as
one
of
themselves
much
as
lord
derby
and
disraeli
were
accepted
as
leaders
of
her
majesty
domestic
opposition
minister
adams
had
a
rank
of
his
own
as
a
kind
of
leader
of
her
majesty
american
opposition
even
the
times
conceded
it
the
years
of
struggle
were
over
and
minister
adams
rapidly
gained
a
position
which
would
have
caused
his
father
or
grandfather
to
stare
with
incredulous
envy
this
form
of
diplomacy
was
chiefly
undiplomatic
and
had
the
peculiar
effect
of
teaching
a
habit
of
diplomacy
useless
or
mischievous
everywhere
but
in
london
nowhere
else
in
the
world
could
one
expect
to
figure
in
a
role
so
unprofessional
the
young
man
knew
no
longer
what
character
he
bore
private
secretary
in
the
morning
son
in
the
afternoon
young
man
about
town
in
the
evening
the
only
character
he
never
bore
was
that
of
diplomatist
except
when
he
wanted
a
card
to
some
great
function
his
diplomatic
education
was
at
an
end
he
seldom
met
a
diplomat
and
never
had
business
with
one
he
could
be
of
no
use
to
them
or
they
to
him
but
he
drifted
inevitably
into
society
and
do
what
he
might
his
next
education
must
be
one
of
english
social
life
tossed
between
the
horns
of
successive
dilemmas
he
reached
his
birthday
without
the
power
of
earning
five
dollars
in
any
occupation
his
friends
in
the
army
were
almost
as
badly
off
but
even
army
life
ruined
a
young
man
less
fatally
than
london
society
had
he
been
rich
this
form
of
ruin
would
have
mattered
nothing
but
the
young
men
of
were
none
of
them
rich
all
had
to
earn
a
living
yet
they
had
reached
high
positions
of
responsibility
and
power
in
camps
and
courts
without
a
dollar
of
their
own
and
with
no
tenure
of
office
henry
adams
had
failed
to
acquire
any
useful
education
he
should
at
least
have
acquired
social
experience
curiously
enough
he
failed
here
also
from
the
european
or
english
point
of
view
he
had
no
social
experience
and
never
got
it
minister
adams
happened
on
a
political
interregnum
owing
to
lord
palmerston
personal
influence
from
to
but
this
political
interregnum
was
less
marked
than
the
social
during
the
same
years
the
prince
consort
was
dead
the
queen
had
retired
the
prince
of
wales
was
still
a
boy
in
its
best
days
victorian
society
had
never
been
smart
during
the
forties
under
the
influence
of
louis
philippe
courts
affected
to
be
simple
serious
and
middle
class
and
they
succeeded
the
taste
of
louis
philippe
was
bourgeois
beyond
any
taste
except
that
of
queen
victoria
style
lingered
in
the
background
with
the
powdered
footman
behind
the
yellow
chariot
but
speaking
socially
the
queen
had
no
style
save
what
she
inherited
balmoral
was
a
startling
revelation
of
royal
taste
nothing
could
be
worse
than
the
toilettes
at
court
unless
it
were
the
way
they
were
worn
one
eyes
might
be
dazzled
by
jewels
but
they
were
heirlooms
and
if
any
lady
appeared
well
dressed
she
was
either
a
foreigner
or
fast
fashion
was
not
fashionable
in
london
until
the
americans
and
the
jews
were
let
loose
the
style
of
london
toilette
universal
in
was
grotesque
like
monckton
milnes
on
horseback
in
rotten
row
society
of
this
sort
might
fit
a
young
man
in
some
degree
for
editing
shakespeare
or
swift
but
had
little
relation
with
the
society
of
and
none
with
that
of
owing
to
other
causes
young
adams
never
got
the
full
training
of
such
style
as
still
existed
the
embarrassments
of
his
first
few
seasons
socially
ruined
him
his
own
want
of
experience
prevented
his
asking
introductions
to
the
ladies
who
ruled
society
his
want
of
friends
prevented
his
knowing
who
these
ladies
were
and
he
had
every
reason
to
expect
snubbing
if
he
put
himself
in
evidence
this
sensitiveness
was
thrown
away
on
english
society
where
men
and
women
treated
each
others
advances
much
more
brutally
than
those
of
strangers
but
young
adams
was
son
and
private
secretary
too
he
could
not
be
as
as
an
englishman
he
was
not
alone
every
young
diplomat
and
most
of
the
old
ones
felt
awkward
in
an
english
house
from
a
certainty
that
they
were
not
precisely
wanted
there
and
a
possibility
that
they
might
be
told
so
if
there
was
in
those
days
a
country
house
in
england
which
had
a
right
to
call
itself
broad
in
views
and
large
in
tastes
it
was
bretton
in
yorkshire
and
if
there
was
a
hostess
who
had
a
right
to
consider
herself
fashionable
as
well
as
charming
it
was
lady
margaret
beaumont
yet
one
morning
at
breakfast
there
sitting
by
her
side
not
for
his
own
merits
henry
adams
heard
her
say
to
herself
in
her
languid
and
liberal
way
with
her
rich
voice
and
musing
manner
looking
into
her
i
do
think
i
care
for
foreigners
not
so
much
on
his
own
account
as
on
hers
the
young
man
could
only
execute
himself
as
gaily
as
he
might
but
lady
margaret
please
make
one
small
exception
for
me
of
course
she
replied
what
was
evident
that
she
did
not
call
him
a
foreigner
and
her
genial
irish
charm
made
the
slip
of
tongue
a
happy
courtesy
but
none
the
less
she
knew
that
except
for
his
momentary
personal
introduction
he
was
in
fact
a
foreigner
and
there
was
no
imaginable
reason
why
she
should
like
him
or
any
other
foreigner
unless
it
were
because
she
was
bored
by
natives
she
seemed
to
feel
that
her
indifference
needed
a
reason
to
excuse
itself
in
her
own
eyes
and
she
showed
the
subconscious
sympathy
of
the
irish
nature
which
never
feels
itself
perfectly
at
home
even
in
england
she
too
was
some
shadowy
shade
always
conscious
of
this
barrier
while
the
war
lasted
the
private
secretary
hid
himself
among
the
herd
of
foreigners
till
he
found
his
relations
fixed
and
unchangeable
he
never
felt
himself
in
society
and
he
never
knew
definitely
what
was
meant
as
society
by
those
who
were
in
it
he
saw
far
enough
to
note
a
score
of
societies
which
seemed
quite
independent
of
each
other
the
smartest
was
the
smallest
and
to
him
almost
wholly
strange
the
largest
was
the
sporting
world
also
unknown
to
him
except
through
the
talk
of
his
acquaintances
between
or
beyond
these
lay
groups
of
nebulous
societies
his
lawyer
friends
like
evarts
frequented
legal
circles
where
one
still
sat
over
the
wine
and
told
anecdotes
of
the
bench
and
bar
but
he
himself
never
set
eyes
on
a
judge
except
when
his
father
took
him
to
call
on
old
lord
lyndhurst
where
they
found
old
lord
campbell
both
abusing
old
lord
brougham
the
church
and
the
bishops
formed
several
societies
which
no
secretary
ever
saw
except
as
an
interloper
the
army
the
navy
the
indian
service
the
medical
and
surgical
professions
city
people
artists
county
families
the
scotch
and
indefinite
other
subdivisions
of
society
existed
which
were
as
strange
to
each
other
as
they
were
to
adams
at
the
end
of
eight
or
ten
seasons
in
london
society
he
professed
to
know
less
about
it
or
how
to
enter
it
than
he
did
when
he
made
his
first
appearance
at
miss
burdett
coutts
in
may
sooner
or
later
every
young
man
dropped
into
a
set
or
circle
and
frequented
the
few
houses
that
were
willing
to
harbor
him
an
american
who
neither
hunted
nor
raced
neither
shot
nor
fished
nor
gambled
and
was
not
marriageable
had
no
need
to
think
of
society
at
large
houses
in
every
hundred
were
useless
to
him
a
greater
bore
to
him
than
he
to
them
thus
the
question
of
getting
into
or
getting
out
of
society
which
troubled
young
foreigners
greatly
settled
itself
after
three
or
four
years
of
painful
speculation
society
had
no
unity
one
wandered
about
in
it
like
a
maggot
in
cheese
it
was
not
a
hansom
cab
to
be
got
into
or
out
of
at
therefore
he
always
professed
himself
ignorant
of
society
he
never
knew
whether
he
had
been
in
it
or
not
but
from
the
accounts
of
his
future
friends
like
general
dick
taylor
or
george
smalley
and
of
various
ladies
who
reigned
in
the
seventies
he
inclined
to
think
that
he
knew
very
little
about
it
certain
great
houses
and
certain
great
functions
of
course
he
attended
like
every
one
else
who
could
get
cards
but
even
of
these
the
number
was
small
that
kept
an
interest
or
helped
education
in
seven
years
he
could
remember
only
two
that
seemed
to
have
any
meaning
for
him
and
he
never
knew
what
that
meaning
was
neither
of
the
two
was
official
neither
was
english
in
interest
and
both
were
scandals
to
the
philosopher
while
they
scarcely
enlightened
men
of
the
world
one
was
at
devonshire
house
an
ordinary
unpremeditated
evening
reception
naturally
every
one
went
to
devonshire
house
if
asked
and
the
rooms
that
night
were
fairly
full
of
the
usual
people
the
private
secretary
was
standing
among
the
rest
when
mme
de
castiglione
entered
the
famous
beauty
of
the
second
empire
how
beautiful
she
may
have
been
or
indeed
what
sort
of
beauty
she
was
adams
never
knew
because
the
company
consisting
of
the
most
refined
and
aristocratic
society
in
the
world
instantly
formed
a
lane
and
stood
in
ranks
to
stare
at
her
while
those
behind
mounted
on
chairs
to
look
over
their
neighbors
heads
so
that
the
lady
walked
through
this
polite
mob
stared
completely
out
of
countenance
and
fled
the
house
at
once
this
was
all
the
other
strange
spectacle
was
at
stafford
house
april
when
in
a
palace
gallery
that
recalled
paolo
veronese
pictures
of
christ
in
his
scenes
of
miracle
garibaldi
in
his
gray
capote
over
his
red
shirt
received
all
london
and
three
duchesses
literally
worshipped
at
his
feet
here
at
all
events
a
private
secretary
had
surely
caught
the
last
and
highest
touch
of
social
experience
but
what
it
meant
what
social
moral
or
mental
development
it
pointed
out
to
the
searcher
of
truth
was
not
a
matter
to
be
treated
fully
by
a
leader
in
the
morning
post
or
even
by
a
sermon
in
westminster
abbey
mme
de
castiglione
and
garibaldi
covered
between
them
too
much
space
for
simple
measurement
their
curves
were
too
complex
for
mere
arithmetic
the
task
of
bringing
the
two
into
any
common
relation
with
an
ordered
social
system
tending
to
orderly
development
in
london
or
elsewhere
was
well
fitted
for
algernon
swinburne
or
victor
hugo
but
was
beyond
any
process
yet
reached
by
the
education
of
henry
adams
who
would
probably
even
then
have
rejected
as
superficial
or
supernatural
all
the
views
taken
by
any
of
the
company
who
looked
on
with
him
at
these
two
interesting
and
perplexing
sights
from
the
court
or
court
society
a
mere
private
secretary
got
nothing
at
all
or
next
to
nothing
that
could
help
him
on
his
road
through
life
royalty
was
in
abeyance
one
was
tempted
to
think
in
these
years
that
the
nicest
distinction
between
the
very
best
society
and
the
was
their
attitude
towards
royalty
the
one
regarded
royalty
as
a
bore
and
avoided
it
or
quietly
said
that
the
queen
had
never
been
in
society
the
same
thing
might
have
been
said
of
fully
half
the
peerage
adams
never
knew
even
the
names
of
half
the
rest
he
never
exchanged
ten
words
with
any
member
of
the
royal
family
he
never
knew
any
one
in
those
years
who
showed
interest
in
any
member
of
the
royal
family
or
who
would
have
given
five
shillings
for
the
opinion
of
any
royal
person
on
any
subject
or
cared
to
enter
any
royal
or
noble
presence
unless
the
house
was
made
attractive
by
as
much
social
effort
as
would
have
been
necessary
in
other
countries
where
no
rank
existed
no
doubt
as
one
of
a
swarm
young
adams
slightly
knew
various
gilded
youth
who
frequented
balls
and
led
such
dancing
as
was
most
in
vogue
but
they
seemed
to
set
no
value
on
rank
their
anxiety
was
only
to
know
where
to
find
the
best
partners
before
midnight
and
the
best
supper
after
midnight
to
the
american
as
to
arthur
pendennis
or
barnes
newcome
the
value
of
social
position
and
knowledge
was
evident
enough
he
valued
it
at
rather
more
than
it
was
worth
to
him
but
it
was
a
shadowy
thing
which
seemed
to
vary
with
every
street
corner
a
thing
which
had
shifting
standards
and
which
no
one
could
catch
outright
the
leaders
and
beauties
of
his
time
with
great
names
and
of
the
utmost
fashion
made
some
of
the
poorest
marriages
and
the
least
showy
careers
tired
of
looking
on
at
society
from
the
outside
adams
grew
to
loathe
the
sight
of
his
court
dress
to
groan
at
every
announcement
of
a
court
ball
and
to
dread
every
invitation
to
a
formal
dinner
the
greatest
social
event
gave
not
half
the
pleasure
that
one
could
buy
for
ten
shillings
at
the
opera
when
patti
sang
cherubino
or
gretchen
and
not
a
fourth
of
the
education
yet
this
was
not
the
opinion
of
the
best
judges
lothrop
motley
who
stood
among
the
very
best
said
to
him
early
in
his
apprenticeship
that
the
london
dinner
and
the
english
country
house
were
the
perfection
of
human
society
the
young
man
meditated
over
it
uncertain
of
its
meaning
motley
could
not
have
thought
the
dinner
itself
perfect
since
there
was
not
then
outside
of
a
few
bankers
or
foreigners
a
good
cook
or
a
good
table
in
london
and
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
dinners
that
motley
ate
came
from
gunter
and
all
were
alike
every
one
especially
in
young
society
complained
bitterly
that
englishmen
did
not
know
a
good
dinner
when
they
ate
it
and
could
not
order
one
if
they
were
given
carte
blanche
henry
adams
was
not
a
judge
and
knew
no
more
than
they
but
he
heard
the
complaints
and
he
could
not
think
that
motley
meant
to
praise
the
english
cuisine
equally
little
could
motley
have
meant
that
dinners
were
good
to
look
at
nothing
could
be
worse
than
the
toilettes
nothing
less
artistic
than
the
appearance
of
the
company
one
eyes
might
be
dazzled
by
family
diamonds
but
if
an
american
woman
were
present
she
was
sure
to
make
comments
about
the
way
the
jewels
were
worn
if
there
was
a
lady
at
table
she
was
either
an
american
or
fast
she
attracted
as
much
notice
as
though
she
were
on
the
stage
no
one
could
possibly
admire
an
english
least
of
all
did
motley
mean
that
the
taste
or
the
manners
were
perfect
the
manners
of
english
society
were
notorious
and
the
taste
was
worse
without
exception
every
american
woman
rose
in
rebellion
against
english
manners
in
fact
the
charm
of
london
which
made
most
impression
on
americans
was
the
violence
of
its
contrasts
the
extreme
badness
of
the
worst
making
background
for
the
distinction
refinement
or
wit
of
a
few
just
as
the
extreme
beauty
of
a
few
superb
women
was
more
effective
against
the
plainness
of
the
crowd
the
result
was
mediaeval
and
amusing
sometimes
coarse
to
a
degree
that
might
have
startled
a
roustabout
and
sometimes
courteous
and
considerate
to
a
degree
that
suggested
king
arthur
round
table
but
this
artistic
contrast
was
surely
not
the
perfection
that
motley
had
in
his
mind
he
meant
something
scholarly
worldly
and
modern
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
tastes
probably
he
meant
that
in
his
favorite
houses
the
tone
was
easy
the
talk
was
good
and
the
standard
of
scholarship
was
high
even
there
he
would
have
been
forced
to
qualify
his
adjectives
no
german
would
have
admitted
that
english
scholarship
was
high
or
that
it
was
scholarship
at
all
or
that
any
wish
for
scholarship
existed
in
england
nothing
that
seemed
to
smell
of
the
shop
or
of
the
was
wanted
one
might
as
well
have
talked
of
christ
at
the
table
of
the
bishop
of
london
as
talk
of
german
philology
at
the
table
of
an
oxford
don
society
if
a
small
literary
class
could
be
called
society
wanted
to
be
amused
in
its
old
way
sydney
smith
who
had
amused
was
dead
so
was
macaulay
who
instructed
if
he
did
not
amuse
thackeray
died
at
christmas
dickens
never
felt
at
home
and
seldom
appeared
in
society
bulwer
lytton
was
not
sprightly
tennyson
detested
strangers
carlyle
was
mostly
detested
by
them
darwin
never
came
to
town
the
men
of
whom
motley
must
have
been
thinking
were
such
as
he
might
meet
at
lord
houghton
breakfasts
grote
jowett
milman
or
froude
browning
matthew
arnold
or
swinburne
bishop
wilberforce
venables
or
hayward
or
perhaps
gladstone
robert
lowe
or
lord
granville
a
relatively
small
class
commonly
isolated
suppressed
and
lost
at
the
usual
london
dinner
such
society
as
this
was
fairly
familiar
even
to
a
private
secretary
but
to
the
literary
american
it
might
well
seem
perfection
since
he
could
find
nothing
of
the
sort
in
america
within
the
narrow
limits
of
this
class
the
american
legation
was
fairly
at
home
possibly
a
score
of
houses
all
liberal
and
all
literary
but
perfect
only
in
the
eyes
of
a
harvard
college
historian
they
could
teach
little
worth
learning
for
their
tastes
were
antiquated
and
their
knowledge
was
ignorance
to
the
next
generation
what
was
altogether
fatal
for
future
purposes
they
were
only
english
a
social
education
in
such
a
medium
was
bound
to
be
useless
in
any
other
yet
adams
had
to
learn
it
to
the
bottom
the
one
thing
needful
for
a
private
secretary
was
that
he
should
not
only
seem
but
should
actually
be
at
home
he
studied
carefully
and
practised
painfully
what
seemed
to
be
the
favorite
accomplishments
of
society
perhaps
his
nervousness
deceived
him
perhaps
he
took
for
an
ideal
of
others
what
was
only
his
reflected
image
but
he
conceived
that
the
perfection
of
human
society
required
that
a
man
should
enter
a
where
he
was
a
total
stranger
and
place
himself
on
the
his
back
to
the
fire
with
an
air
of
expectant
benevolence
without
curiosity
much
as
though
he
had
dropped
in
at
a
charity
concert
kindly
disposed
to
applaud
the
performers
and
to
overlook
mistakes
this
ideal
rarely
succeeded
in
youth
and
towards
thirty
it
took
a
form
of
modified
insolence
and
offensive
patronage
but
about
sixty
it
mellowed
into
courtesy
kindliness
and
even
deference
to
the
young
which
had
extraordinary
charm
both
in
women
and
in
men
unfortunately
adams
could
not
wait
till
sixty
for
education
he
had
his
living
to
earn
and
the
english
air
of
patronage
would
earn
no
income
for
him
anywhere
else
after
five
or
six
years
of
constant
practice
any
one
can
acquire
the
habit
of
going
from
one
strange
company
to
another
without
thinking
much
of
one
self
or
of
them
as
though
silently
reflecting
that
in
a
world
where
we
are
all
insects
no
insect
is
alien
perhaps
they
are
human
in
parts
but
the
dreamy
habit
of
mind
which
comes
from
solitude
in
crowds
is
not
fitness
for
social
success
except
in
london
everywhere
else
it
is
injury
england
was
a
social
kingdom
whose
social
coinage
had
no
currency
elsewhere
englishwomen
from
the
educational
point
of
view
could
give
nothing
until
they
approached
forty
years
old
then
they
become
very
interesting
very
charming
to
the
man
of
fifty
the
young
american
was
not
worth
the
young
englishwoman
notice
and
never
received
it
neither
understood
the
other
only
in
the
domestic
relation
in
the
country
never
in
society
at
large
a
young
american
might
accidentally
make
friends
with
an
englishwoman
of
his
own
age
but
it
never
happened
to
henry
adams
his
susceptible
nature
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
american
girls
which
was
professional
duty
rather
than
education
as
long
as
diplomacy
held
its
own
thus
he
found
himself
launched
on
waters
where
he
had
never
meant
to
sail
and
floating
along
a
stream
which
carried
him
far
from
his
port
his
third
season
in
london
society
saw
the
end
of
his
diplomatic
education
and
began
for
him
the
social
life
of
a
young
man
who
felt
at
home
in
england
more
at
home
there
than
anywhere
else
with
this
feeling
the
mere
habit
of
going
to
dinners
receptions
and
balls
had
nothing
to
do
one
might
go
to
scores
without
a
sensation
of
home
one
might
stay
in
no
end
of
country
houses
without
forgetting
that
one
was
a
total
stranger
and
could
never
be
anything
else
one
might
bow
to
half
the
dukes
and
duchesses
in
england
and
feel
only
the
more
strange
hundreds
of
persons
might
pass
with
a
nod
and
never
come
nearer
close
relation
in
a
place
like
london
is
a
personal
mystery
as
profound
as
chemical
affinity
thousands
pass
and
one
separates
himself
from
the
mass
to
attach
himself
to
another
and
so
make
little
by
little
a
group
one
morning
april
he
was
asked
to
breakfast
with
sir
henry
holland
the
old
court
physician
who
had
been
acquainted
with
every
american
minister
since
edward
everett
and
was
a
valuable
social
ally
who
had
the
courage
to
try
to
be
of
use
to
everybody
and
who
while
asking
the
private
secretary
to
breakfast
one
day
was
too
discreet
to
betray
what
he
might
have
learned
about
rebel
doings
at
his
the
day
before
he
had
been
friendly
with
the
legation
in
the
teeth
of
society
and
was
still
bearing
up
against
the
weight
of
opinion
so
that
young
adams
could
not
decline
his
invitations
although
they
obliged
him
to
breakfast
in
brook
street
at
nine
in
the
morning
alternately
with
james
mason
old
holland
was
himself
as
hale
as
a
hawk
driving
all
day
about
london
and
eating
welsh
rarebit
every
night
before
bed
he
thought
that
any
young
man
should
be
pleased
to
take
his
early
muffin
in
brook
street
and
supply
a
few
crumbs
of
war
news
for
the
daily
peckings
of
eminent
patients
meekly
when
summoned
the
private
secretary
went
and
on
reaching
the
front
door
this
particular
morning
he
found
there
another
young
man
in
the
act
of
rapping
the
knocker
they
entered
the
breakfastroom
together
where
they
were
introduced
to
each
other
and
adams
learned
that
the
other
guest
was
a
cambridge
undergraduate
charles
milnes
gaskell
son
of
james
milnes
gaskell
the
member
for
wenlock
another
of
the
yorkshire
milneses
from
thornes
near
wakefield
fate
had
fixed
adams
to
yorkshire
by
another
chance
it
happened
that
young
milnes
gaskell
was
intimate
at
cambridge
with
william
everett
who
was
also
about
to
take
his
degree
a
third
chance
inspired
evarts
with
a
fancy
for
visiting
cambridge
and
led
william
everett
to
offer
his
services
as
host
adams
acted
as
courier
to
evarts
and
at
the
end
of
may
they
went
down
for
a
few
days
when
william
everett
did
the
honors
as
host
with
a
kindness
and
attention
that
made
his
cousin
sorely
conscious
of
his
own
social
shortcomings
cambridge
was
pretty
and
the
dons
were
kind
evarts
enjoyed
his
visit
but
this
was
merely
a
part
of
the
private
day
work
what
affected
his
whole
life
was
the
intimacy
then
begun
with
milnes
gaskell
and
his
circle
of
undergraduate
friends
just
about
to
enter
the
world
intimates
are
predestined
adams
met
in
england
a
thousand
people
great
and
small
jostled
against
every
one
from
royal
princes
to
loafers
attended
endless
official
functions
and
private
parties
visited
every
part
of
the
united
kingdom
and
was
not
quite
a
stranger
at
the
legations
in
paris
and
rome
he
knew
the
societies
of
certain
country
houses
and
acquired
habits
of
calls
but
all
this
gave
him
nothing
to
do
and
was
life
wasted
for
him
nothing
whatever
could
be
gained
by
escorting
american
ladies
to
or
american
gentlemen
to
levees
at
james
palace
or
bowing
solemnly
to
people
with
great
titles
at
court
balls
or
even
by
awkwardly
jostling
royalty
at
all
this
was
done
for
the
government
and
neither
president
lincoln
nor
secretary
seward
would
ever
know
enough
of
their
business
to
thank
him
for
doing
what
they
did
not
know
how
to
get
properly
done
by
their
own
servants
but
for
henry
adams
not
private
secretary
all
the
time
taken
up
by
such
duties
was
wasted
on
the
other
hand
his
few
personal
intimacies
concerned
him
alone
and
the
chance
that
made
him
almost
a
yorkshireman
was
one
that
must
have
started
under
the
heptarchy
more
than
any
other
county
in
england
yorkshire
retained
a
sort
of
social
independence
of
london
scotland
itself
was
hardly
more
distinct
the
yorkshire
type
had
always
been
the
strongest
of
the
british
strains
the
norwegian
and
the
dane
were
a
different
race
from
the
saxon
even
lancashire
had
not
the
mass
and
the
cultivation
of
the
west
riding
london
could
never
quite
absorb
yorkshire
which
in
its
turn
had
no
great
love
for
london
and
freely
showed
it
to
a
certain
degree
evident
enough
to
yorkshiremen
yorkshire
was
not
english
or
was
all
england
as
they
might
choose
to
express
it
this
must
have
been
the
reason
why
young
adams
was
drawn
there
rather
than
elsewhere
monckton
milnes
alone
took
the
trouble
to
draw
him
and
possibly
milnes
was
the
only
man
in
england
with
whom
henry
adams
at
that
moment
had
a
chance
of
calling
out
such
an
effort
neither
oxford
nor
cambridge
nor
any
region
south
of
the
humber
contained
a
considerable
house
where
a
young
american
would
have
been
sought
as
a
friend
eccentricity
alone
did
not
account
for
it
monckton
milnes
was
a
singular
type
but
his
distant
cousin
james
milnes
gaskell
was
another
quite
as
marked
in
an
opposite
sense
milnes
never
seemed
willing
to
rest
milnes
gaskell
never
seemed
willing
to
move
in
his
youth
one
of
a
very
famous
group
arthur
hallam
tennyson
manning
gladstone
francis
doyle
and
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
promising
an
adorer
of
george
canning
in
parliament
since
coming
of
age
married
into
the
powerful
connection
of
the
wynns
of
wynstay
rich
according
to
yorkshire
standards
intimate
with
his
political
leaders
he
was
one
of
the
numerous
englishmen
who
refuse
office
rather
than
make
the
effort
of
carrying
it
and
want
power
only
to
make
it
a
source
of
indolence
he
was
a
voracious
reader
and
an
admirable
critic
he
had
forty
years
of
parliamentary
tradition
on
his
memory
he
liked
to
talk
and
to
listen
he
liked
his
dinner
and
in
spite
of
george
canning
his
dry
champagne
he
liked
wit
and
anecdote
but
he
belonged
to
the
generation
of
a
generation
which
could
not
survive
the
telegraph
and
railway
and
which
even
yorkshire
could
hardly
produce
again
to
an
american
he
was
a
character
even
more
unusual
and
more
fascinating
than
his
distant
cousin
lord
houghton
milnes
gaskell
was
kind
to
the
young
american
whom
his
son
brought
to
the
house
and
milnes
gaskell
was
kinder
for
she
thought
the
american
perhaps
a
less
dangerous
friend
than
some
englishman
might
be
for
her
son
and
she
was
probably
right
the
american
had
the
sense
to
see
that
she
was
herself
one
of
the
most
intelligent
and
sympathetic
women
in
england
her
sister
miss
charlotte
wynn
was
another
and
both
were
of
an
age
and
a
position
in
society
that
made
their
friendship
a
compliment
as
well
as
a
pleasure
their
consent
and
approval
settled
the
matter
in
england
the
family
is
a
serious
fact
once
admitted
to
it
one
is
there
for
life
london
might
utterly
vanish
from
one
horizon
but
as
long
as
life
lasted
yorkshire
lived
for
its
friends
in
the
year
james
milnes
gaskell
who
had
sat
for
thirty
years
in
parliament
as
one
of
the
members
for
the
borough
of
wenlock
in
shropshire
bought
wenlock
abbey
and
the
estate
that
included
the
old
monastic
buildings
this
new
or
old
plaything
amused
milnes
gaskell
the
prior
house
a
charming
specimen
of
architecture
had
been
long
left
to
decay
as
a
farmhouse
she
put
it
in
order
and
went
there
to
spend
a
part
of
the
autumn
of
young
adams
was
one
of
her
first
guests
and
drove
about
wenlock
edge
and
the
wrekin
with
her
learning
the
loveliness
of
this
exquisite
country
and
its
stores
of
curious
antiquity
it
was
a
new
and
charming
existence
an
experience
greatly
to
be
envied
ideal
repose
and
rural
shakespearian
peace
but
a
few
years
of
it
were
likely
to
complete
his
education
and
fit
him
to
act
a
fairly
useful
part
in
life
as
an
englishman
an
ecclesiastic
and
a
contemporary
of
chaucer
chapter
xiv
dilettantism
the
campaign
of
and
the
reelection
of
lincoln
in
november
set
the
american
minister
on
so
firm
a
footing
that
he
could
safely
regard
his
own
anxieties
as
over
and
the
anxieties
of
earl
russell
and
the
emperor
napoleon
as
begun
with
a
few
months
more
his
own
term
of
four
years
would
come
to
an
end
and
even
though
the
questions
still
under
discussion
with
england
should
somewhat
prolong
his
stay
he
might
look
forward
with
some
confidence
to
his
return
home
in
his
son
no
longer
fretted
the
time
for
going
into
the
army
had
passed
if
he
were
to
be
useful
at
all
it
must
be
as
a
son
and
as
a
son
he
was
treated
with
the
widest
indulgence
and
trust
he
knew
that
he
was
doing
himself
no
good
by
staying
in
london
but
thus
far
in
life
he
had
done
himself
no
good
anywhere
and
reached
his
birthday
without
having
advanced
a
step
that
he
could
see
beyond
his
for
the
most
part
his
friends
were
worse
off
than
he
the
war
was
about
to
end
and
they
were
to
be
set
adrift
in
a
world
they
would
find
altogether
strange
at
this
point
as
though
to
cut
the
last
thread
of
relation
six
months
were
suddenly
dropped
out
of
his
life
in
england
the
london
climate
had
told
on
some
of
the
family
the
physicians
prescribed
a
winter
in
italy
of
course
the
private
secretary
was
detached
as
their
escort
since
this
was
one
of
his
professional
functions
and
he
passed
six
months
gaining
an
education
as
italian
courier
while
the
civil
war
came
to
its
end
as
far
as
other
education
went
he
got
none
but
he
was
amused
travelling
in
all
possible
luxury
at
some
one
expense
with
diplomatic
privileges
and
position
was
a
form
of
travel
hitherto
untried
the
cornice
in
vettura
was
delightful
sorrento
in
winter
offered
hills
to
climb
and
grottoes
to
explore
and
naples
near
by
to
visit
rome
at
easter
was
an
experience
necessary
for
the
education
of
every
properly
trained
private
secretary
the
journey
north
by
vettura
through
perugia
and
sienna
was
a
dream
the
splugen
pass
if
not
equal
to
the
stelvio
was
worth
seeing
paris
had
always
something
to
show
the
chances
of
accidental
education
were
not
so
great
as
they
had
been
since
one
field
of
experience
had
grown
large
but
perhaps
a
season
at
baden
baden
in
these
later
days
of
its
brilliancy
offered
some
chances
of
instruction
if
it
were
only
the
sight
of
fashionable
europe
and
america
on
the
watching
the
duke
of
hamilton
in
the
middle
improving
his
social
advantages
by
the
conversation
of
cora
pearl
the
assassination
of
president
lincoln
fell
on
the
party
while
they
were
at
rome
where
it
seemed
singularly
fitting
to
that
nursery
of
murderers
and
murdered
as
though
america
were
also
getting
educated
again
one
went
to
meditate
on
the
steps
of
the
santa
maria
in
ara
coeli
but
the
lesson
seemed
as
shallow
as
before
nothing
happened
the
travellers
changed
no
plan
or
movement
the
minister
did
not
recall
them
to
london
the
season
was
over
before
they
returned
and
when
the
private
secretary
sat
down
again
at
his
desk
in
portland
place
before
a
mass
of
copy
in
arrears
he
saw
before
him
a
world
so
changed
as
to
be
beyond
connection
with
the
past
his
identity
if
one
could
call
a
bundle
of
disconnected
memories
an
identity
seemed
to
remain
but
his
life
was
once
more
broken
into
separate
pieces
he
was
a
spider
and
had
to
spin
a
new
web
in
some
new
place
with
a
new
attachment
all
his
american
friends
and
contemporaries
who
were
still
alive
looked
singularly
commonplace
without
uniforms
and
hastened
to
get
married
and
retire
into
back
streets
and
suburbs
until
they
could
find
employment
minister
adams
too
was
going
home
next
fall
and
when
the
fall
came
he
was
going
home
next
spring
and
when
the
spring
came
president
andrew
johnson
was
at
loggerheads
with
the
senate
and
found
it
best
to
keep
things
unchanged
after
the
usual
manner
of
public
servants
who
had
acquired
the
habit
of
office
and
lost
the
faculty
of
will
the
members
of
the
legation
in
london
continued
the
daily
routine
of
english
society
which
after
becoming
a
habit
threatened
to
become
a
vice
had
henry
adams
shared
a
single
taste
with
the
young
englishmen
of
his
time
he
would
have
been
lost
but
the
custom
of
pounding
up
and
down
rotten
row
every
day
on
a
hack
was
not
a
taste
and
yet
was
all
the
sport
he
shared
evidently
he
must
set
to
work
he
must
get
a
new
education
he
must
begin
a
career
of
his
own
nothing
was
easier
to
say
but
even
his
father
admitted
two
careers
to
be
closed
for
the
law
diplomacy
had
unfitted
him
for
diplomacy
he
already
knew
too
much
any
one
who
had
held
during
the
four
most
difficult
years
of
american
diplomacy
a
position
at
the
centre
of
action
with
his
hands
actually
touching
the
lever
of
power
could
not
beg
a
post
of
secretary
at
vienna
or
madrid
in
order
to
bore
himself
doing
nothing
until
the
next
president
should
do
him
the
honor
to
turn
him
out
for
once
all
his
advisers
agreed
that
diplomacy
was
not
possible
in
any
ordinary
system
he
would
have
been
called
back
to
serve
in
the
state
department
but
between
the
president
and
the
senate
service
of
any
sort
became
a
delusion
the
choice
of
career
was
more
difficult
than
the
education
which
had
proved
impracticable
adams
saw
no
road
in
fact
there
was
none
all
his
friends
were
trying
one
path
or
another
but
none
went
a
way
that
he
could
have
taken
john
hay
passed
through
london
in
order
to
bury
himself
in
legations
for
years
before
he
drifted
home
again
to
join
whitelaw
reid
and
george
smalley
on
the
tribune
frank
barlow
and
frank
bartlett
carried
commissions
into
small
law
business
miles
stayed
in
the
army
henry
higginson
after
a
desperate
struggle
was
forced
into
state
street
charles
adams
wandered
about
with
rank
trying
to
find
employment
scores
of
others
tried
experiments
more
or
less
unsuccessful
henry
adams
could
see
easy
ways
of
making
a
hundred
blunders
he
could
see
no
likely
way
of
making
a
legitimate
success
such
as
it
was
his
education
was
wanted
nowhere
one
profession
alone
seemed
possible
the
press
in
he
would
have
said
that
he
was
born
to
be
an
editor
like
at
least
a
thousand
other
young
graduates
from
american
colleges
who
entered
the
world
every
year
enjoying
the
same
conviction
but
in
the
situation
was
altered
the
possession
of
money
had
become
doubly
needful
for
success
and
double
energy
was
essential
to
get
money
america
had
more
than
doubled
her
scale
yet
the
press
was
still
the
last
resource
of
the
educated
poor
who
could
not
be
artists
and
would
not
be
tutors
any
man
who
was
fit
for
nothing
else
could
write
an
editorial
or
a
criticism
the
enormous
mass
of
misinformation
accumulated
in
ten
years
of
nomad
life
could
always
be
worked
off
on
a
helpless
public
in
diluted
doses
if
one
could
but
secure
a
table
in
the
corner
of
a
newspaper
office
the
press
was
an
inferior
pulpit
an
anonymous
schoolmaster
a
cheap
but
it
was
still
the
nearest
approach
to
a
career
for
the
literary
survivor
of
a
wrecked
education
for
the
press
then
henry
adams
decided
to
fit
himself
and
since
he
could
not
go
home
to
get
practical
training
he
set
to
work
to
do
what
he
could
in
london
he
knew
as
well
as
any
reporter
on
the
new
york
herald
that
this
was
not
an
american
way
of
beginning
and
he
knew
a
certain
number
of
other
drawbacks
which
the
reporter
could
not
see
so
clearly
do
what
he
might
he
drew
breath
only
in
the
atmosphere
of
english
methods
and
thoughts
he
could
breathe
none
other
his
mother
who
should
have
been
a
competent
judge
since
her
success
and
popularity
in
england
exceeded
that
of
her
husband
averred
that
every
woman
who
lived
a
certain
time
in
england
came
to
look
and
dress
like
an
englishwoman
no
matter
how
she
struggled
henry
adams
felt
himself
catching
an
english
tone
of
mind
and
processes
of
thought
though
at
heart
more
hostile
to
them
than
ever
as
though
to
make
him
more
helpless
and
wholly
distort
his
life
england
grew
more
and
more
agreeable
and
amusing
minister
adams
became
in
almost
a
historical
monument
in
london
he
held
a
position
altogether
his
own
his
old
opponents
disappeared
lord
palmerston
died
in
october
lord
russell
tottered
on
six
months
longer
but
then
vanished
from
power
and
in
july
the
conservatives
came
into
office
traditionally
the
tories
were
easier
to
deal
with
than
the
whigs
and
minister
adams
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
change
his
personal
relations
were
excellent
and
his
personal
weight
increased
year
by
year
on
that
score
the
private
secretary
had
no
cares
and
not
much
copy
his
own
position
was
modest
but
it
was
enough
the
life
he
led
was
agreeable
his
friends
were
all
he
wanted
and
except
that
he
was
at
the
mercy
of
politics
he
felt
much
at
ease
of
his
daily
life
he
had
only
to
reckon
so
many
breakfasts
so
many
dinners
so
many
receptions
balls
theatres
and
so
many
cards
to
be
left
so
many
americans
to
be
escorted
the
usual
routine
of
every
young
american
in
a
legation
all
counting
for
nothing
in
sum
because
even
if
it
had
been
his
official
duty
which
it
was
not
it
was
mere
routine
a
single
continuous
unbroken
act
which
led
to
nothing
and
nowhere
except
portland
place
and
the
grave
the
path
that
led
somewhere
was
the
english
habit
of
mind
which
deepened
its
ruts
every
day
the
english
mind
was
like
the
london
a
comfortable
and
easy
spot
filled
with
bits
and
fragments
of
incoherent
furnitures
which
were
never
meant
to
go
together
and
could
be
arranged
in
any
relation
without
making
a
whole
except
by
the
square
room
philosophy
might
dispute
about
innate
ideas
till
the
stars
died
out
in
the
sky
but
about
innate
tastes
no
one
except
perhaps
a
collie
dog
has
the
right
to
doubt
least
of
all
the
englishman
for
his
tastes
are
his
being
he
drifts
after
them
as
unconsciously
as
a
drifts
after
his
flowers
and
in
england
every
one
must
drift
with
him
most
young
englishmen
drifted
to
the
or
the
moors
or
the
a
few
towards
books
one
or
two
followed
some
form
of
science
and
a
number
took
to
what
for
want
of
a
better
name
they
called
art
young
adams
inherited
a
certain
taste
for
the
same
pursuit
from
his
father
who
insisted
that
he
had
it
not
because
he
could
not
see
what
his
son
thought
he
saw
in
turner
the
minister
on
the
other
hand
carried
a
sort
of
aesthetic
of
his
own
which
he
regarded
as
amusement
and
never
called
art
so
he
would
wander
off
on
a
sunday
to
attend
service
successively
in
all
the
city
churches
built
by
sir
christopher
wren
or
he
would
disappear
from
the
legation
day
after
day
to
attend
coin
sales
at
sotheby
where
his
son
attended
alternate
sales
of
drawings
engravings
or
neither
knew
enough
to
talk
much
about
the
other
tastes
but
the
only
difference
between
them
was
a
slight
difference
of
direction
the
minister
mind
like
his
writings
showed
a
correctness
of
form
and
line
that
his
son
would
have
been
well
pleased
had
he
inherited
of
all
supposed
english
tastes
that
of
art
was
the
most
alluring
and
treacherous
once
drawn
into
it
one
had
small
chance
of
escape
for
it
had
no
centre
or
circumference
no
beginning
middle
or
end
no
origin
no
object
and
no
conceivable
result
as
education
in
london
one
met
no
corrective
the
only
american
who
came
by
capable
of
teaching
was
william
hunt
who
stopped
to
paint
the
portrait
of
the
minister
which
now
completes
the
family
series
at
harvard
college
hunt
talked
constantly
and
was
or
afterwards
became
a
famous
teacher
but
henry
adams
did
not
know
enough
to
learn
perhaps
too
he
had
inherited
or
acquired
a
stock
of
tastes
as
young
men
must
which
he
was
slow
to
outgrow
hunt
had
no
time
to
sweep
out
the
rubbish
of
adams
mind
the
portrait
finished
he
went
as
often
as
he
could
adams
ran
over
to
paris
for
sunshine
and
there
always
sought
out
richardson
in
his
attic
in
the
rue
du
bac
or
wherever
he
lived
and
they
went
off
to
dine
at
the
palais
royal
and
talk
of
whatever
interested
the
students
of
the
beaux
arts
richardson
too
had
much
to
say
but
had
not
yet
seized
his
style
adams
caught
very
little
of
what
lay
in
his
mind
and
the
less
because
to
adams
everything
french
was
bad
except
the
restaurants
while
the
continuous
life
in
england
made
french
art
seem
worst
of
all
this
did
not
prove
that
english
art
in
was
good
far
from
it
but
it
helped
to
make
of
all
art
after
the
manner
of
england
not
in
the
legation
or
in
london
but
in
yorkshire
at
thornes
adams
met
the
man
that
pushed
him
furthest
in
this
english
garden
of
innate
disorder
called
taste
the
older
daughter
of
the
milnes
gaskells
had
married
francis
turner
palgrave
few
americans
will
ever
ask
whether
any
one
has
described
the
palgraves
but
the
family
was
one
of
the
most
describable
in
all
england
at
that
day
old
sir
francis
the
father
had
been
much
the
greatest
of
all
the
historians
of
early
england
the
only
one
who
was
and
the
reason
of
his
superiority
lay
in
his
name
which
was
cohen
and
his
mind
which
was
cohen
also
or
at
least
not
english
he
changed
his
name
to
palgrave
in
order
to
please
his
wife
they
had
a
band
of
remarkable
sons
francis
turner
gifford
reginald
inglis
all
of
whom
made
their
mark
gifford
was
perhaps
the
most
eccentric
but
his
travels
in
arabia
were
famous
even
among
the
famous
travels
of
that
generation
francis
turner
or
as
he
was
commonly
called
frank
palgrave
unable
to
work
off
his
restlessness
in
travel
like
gifford
and
stifled
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
board
of
education
became
a
critic
his
art
criticisms
helped
to
make
the
saturday
review
a
terror
to
the
british
artist
his
literary
taste
condensed
into
the
golden
treasury
helped
adams
to
more
literary
education
than
he
ever
got
from
any
taste
of
his
own
palgrave
himself
held
rank
as
one
of
the
minor
poets
his
hymns
had
vogue
as
an
he
was
too
ferocious
to
be
liked
even
holman
hunt
found
his
temper
humorous
among
many
rivals
he
may
perhaps
have
had
a
right
to
claim
the
rank
of
being
the
most
unpopular
man
in
london
but
he
liked
to
teach
and
asked
only
for
a
docile
pupil
adams
was
docile
enough
for
he
knew
nothing
and
liked
to
listen
indeed
he
had
to
listen
whether
he
liked
or
not
for
palgrave
voice
was
strident
and
nothing
could
stop
him
literature
painting
sculpture
architecture
were
open
fields
for
his
attacks
which
were
always
intelligent
if
not
always
kind
and
when
these
failed
he
readily
descended
to
meaner
levels
john
richard
green
who
was
palgrave
precise
opposite
and
whose
irish
charm
of
touch
and
humor
defended
him
from
most
assaults
used
to
tell
with
delight
of
palgrave
call
on
him
just
after
he
had
moved
into
his
new
queen
anne
house
in
kensington
square
palgrave
called
yesterday
and
the
first
thing
he
said
was
counted
three
anachronisms
on
your
front
doorstep
another
savage
critic
also
a
poet
was
thomas
woolner
a
type
almost
more
emphatic
than
palgrave
in
a
society
which
resounded
with
emphasis
woolner
sculpture
showed
none
of
the
rough
assertion
that
woolner
himself
showed
when
he
was
not
making
supernatural
effort
to
be
courteous
but
his
busts
were
remarkable
and
his
work
altogether
was
in
palgrave
clamorous
opinion
the
best
of
his
day
he
took
the
matter
of
british
art
or
want
of
art
seriously
almost
ferociously
as
a
personal
grievance
and
torture
at
times
he
was
rather
terrifying
in
the
anarchistic
wrath
of
his
denunciation
as
henry
adams
felt
no
responsibility
for
english
art
and
had
no
american
art
to
offer
for
sacrifice
he
listened
with
enjoyment
to
language
much
like
carlyle
and
accepted
it
without
a
qualm
on
the
other
hand
as
a
third
member
of
this
critical
group
he
fell
in
with
stopford
brooke
whose
tastes
lay
in
the
same
direction
and
whose
expression
was
modified
by
clerical
propriety
among
these
men
one
wandered
off
into
paths
of
education
much
too
devious
and
slippery
for
an
american
foot
to
follow
he
would
have
done
better
to
go
on
the
as
far
as
concerned
a
career
fortunately
for
him
he
knew
too
little
ever
to
be
an
still
less
an
artist
for
some
things
ignorance
is
good
and
art
is
one
of
them
he
knew
he
knew
nothing
and
had
not
the
trained
eye
or
the
keen
instinct
that
trusted
itself
but
he
was
curious
as
he
went
on
to
find
out
how
much
others
knew
he
took
palgrave
word
as
final
about
a
drawing
of
rembrandt
or
michael
angelo
and
he
trusted
woolner
implicitly
about
a
turner
but
when
he
quoted
their
authority
to
any
dealer
the
dealer
it
and
declared
that
it
had
no
weight
in
the
trade
if
he
went
to
a
sale
of
drawings
or
paintings
at
sotheby
or
christie
an
hour
afterwards
he
saw
these
same
dealers
watching
palgrave
or
woolner
for
a
point
and
bidding
over
them
he
rarely
found
two
dealers
agree
in
judgment
he
once
bought
a
from
the
artist
himself
out
of
his
studio
and
had
it
doubted
an
hour
afterwards
by
the
dealer
to
whose
place
he
took
it
for
framing
he
was
reduced
to
admit
that
he
could
not
prove
its
authenticity
internal
evidence
was
against
it
one
morning
in
early
july
palgrave
stopped
at
the
legation
in
portland
place
on
his
way
downtown
and
offered
to
take
adams
to
sotheby
where
a
small
collection
of
old
drawings
was
on
show
the
collection
was
rather
a
curious
one
said
to
be
that
of
sir
anthony
westcomb
from
liverpool
with
an
undisturbed
record
of
a
century
but
with
nothing
to
attract
notice
probably
none
but
collectors
or
experts
examined
the
portfolios
some
dozens
of
these
were
always
on
hand
following
every
sale
and
especially
on
the
lookout
for
old
drawings
which
became
rarer
every
year
turning
rapidly
over
the
numbers
palgrave
stopped
at
one
containing
several
small
drawings
one
marked
as
rembrandt
one
as
rafael
and
putting
his
finger
on
the
rafael
after
careful
examination
i
should
buy
this
he
said
it
looks
to
me
like
one
of
those
things
that
sell
for
five
shillings
one
day
and
fifty
pounds
the
next
adams
marked
it
for
a
bid
and
the
next
morning
came
down
to
the
auction
the
numbers
sold
slowly
and
at
noon
he
thought
he
might
safely
go
to
lunch
when
he
came
back
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
drawing
was
gone
much
annoyed
at
his
own
stupidity
since
palgrave
had
expressly
said
he
wanted
the
drawing
for
himself
if
he
had
not
in
a
manner
given
it
to
adams
the
culprit
waited
for
the
sale
to
close
and
then
asked
the
clerk
for
the
name
of
the
buyer
it
was
holloway
the
near
covent
garden
whom
he
slightly
knew
going
at
once
to
the
shop
he
waited
till
young
holloway
came
in
with
his
purchases
under
his
arm
and
without
attempt
at
preface
he
said
you
bought
holloway
a
number
that
i
wanted
do
you
mind
letting
me
have
it
holloway
took
out
the
parcel
looked
over
the
drawings
and
said
that
he
had
bought
the
number
for
the
sake
of
the
rembrandt
which
he
thought
possibly
genuine
taking
that
out
adams
might
have
the
rest
for
the
price
he
paid
for
the
lot
twelve
shillings
thus
down
to
that
moment
every
expert
in
london
had
probably
seen
these
drawings
two
of
them
only
two
had
thought
them
worth
buying
at
any
price
and
of
these
two
palgrave
chose
the
rafael
holloway
the
one
marked
as
rembrandt
adams
the
purchaser
of
the
rafael
knew
nothing
whatever
on
the
subject
but
thought
he
might
credit
himself
with
education
to
the
value
of
twelve
shillings
and
call
the
drawing
nothing
such
items
of
education
commonly
came
higher
he
took
the
drawing
to
palgrave
it
was
closely
pasted
to
an
old
rather
thin
cardboard
mount
and
on
holding
it
up
to
the
window
one
could
see
lines
on
the
reverse
take
it
down
to
reed
at
the
british
museum
said
palgrave
he
is
curator
of
the
drawings
and
if
you
ask
him
he
will
have
it
taken
off
the
mount
adams
amused
himself
for
a
day
or
two
by
searching
rafael
works
for
the
figure
which
he
found
at
last
in
the
parnasso
the
figure
of
horace
of
which
as
it
happened
though
adams
did
not
know
it
the
british
museum
owned
a
much
finer
drawing
at
last
he
took
the
dirty
little
unfinished
sketch
to
reed
whom
he
found
in
the
curator
room
with
some
of
the
finest
rafael
drawings
in
existence
hanging
on
the
walls
yes
said
mr
reed
i
noticed
this
at
the
sale
but
it
not
rafael
adams
feeling
himself
incompetent
to
discuss
this
subject
reported
the
result
to
palgrave
who
said
that
reed
knew
nothing
about
it
also
this
point
lay
beyond
adams
competence
but
he
noted
that
reed
was
in
the
employ
of
the
british
museum
as
curator
of
the
best
or
nearly
the
best
collection
in
the
world
especially
of
rafaels
and
that
he
bought
for
the
museum
as
expert
he
had
rejected
both
the
rafael
and
the
rembrandt
at
and
after
his
attention
was
recalled
to
the
rafael
for
a
further
opinion
he
rejected
it
again
a
week
later
adams
returned
for
the
drawing
which
reed
took
out
of
his
drawer
and
gave
him
saying
with
what
seemed
a
little
doubt
or
hesitation
i
should
tell
you
that
the
paper
shows
a
which
i
find
the
same
as
that
of
paper
used
by
marc
antonio
a
little
taken
back
by
this
method
of
studying
art
a
method
which
even
a
poor
and
ignorant
american
might
use
as
well
as
rafael
himself
adams
asked
stupidly
then
you
think
it
genuine
possibly
replied
reed
but
much
overdrawn
here
was
expert
opinion
after
a
second
revise
with
help
of
in
adams
opinion
it
was
alone
worth
another
twelve
shillings
as
education
but
this
was
not
all
reed
continued
the
lines
on
the
back
seem
to
be
writing
which
i
can
not
read
but
if
you
will
take
it
down
to
the
they
will
read
it
for
you
adams
took
the
sheet
down
to
the
keeper
of
the
manuscripts
and
begged
him
to
read
the
lines
the
keeper
after
a
few
minutes
study
very
obligingly
said
he
could
not
it
is
scratched
with
an
crayon
very
rapidly
with
many
unusual
abbreviations
and
old
forms
if
any
one
in
europe
can
read
it
it
is
the
old
man
at
the
table
yonder
libri
take
it
to
him
this
expert
broke
down
on
the
alphabet
he
could
not
even
judge
a
manuscript
but
adams
had
no
right
to
complain
for
he
had
nothing
to
pay
not
even
twelve
shillings
though
he
thought
these
experts
worth
more
at
least
for
his
education
accordingly
he
carried
his
paper
to
libri
a
total
stranger
to
him
and
asked
the
old
man
as
deferentially
as
possible
to
tell
him
whether
the
lines
had
any
meaning
had
adams
not
been
an
ignorant
person
he
would
have
known
all
about
libri
but
his
ignorance
was
vast
and
perhaps
was
for
the
best
libri
looked
at
the
paper
and
then
looked
again
and
at
last
bade
him
sit
down
and
wait
half
an
hour
passed
before
he
called
adams
back
and
showed
him
these
lines
or
questo
credo
ben
che
una
elleria
te
offende
tanto
che
te
offese
il
core
perche
sei
grande
nol

e
gia
non
credi
il

valore
passate
gia

tutte
gelosie
tu
sei
di
sasso
non
hai
piu
dolore
as
far
as
adams
could
afterwards
recall
it
this
was
reading
but
he
added
that
the
abbreviations
were
many
and
unusual
that
the
writing
was
very
ancient
and
that
the
word
he
read
as
elleria
in
the
first
line
was
not
italian
at
all
by
this
time
one
had
got
too
far
beyond
one
depth
to
ask
questions
if
libri
could
not
read
italian
very
clearly
adams
had
better
not
offer
to
help
him
he
took
the
drawing
thanked
everybody
and
having
exhausted
the
experts
of
the
british
museum
took
a
cab
to
woolner
studio
where
he
showed
the
figure
and
repeated
opinion
woolner
snorted
reed
a
fool
he
said
he
knows
nothing
about
it
there
may
be
a
rotten
line
or
two
but
the
drawing
all
right
for
forty
years
adams
kept
this
drawing
on
his
mantelpiece
partly
for
its
own
interest
but
largely
for
curiosity
to
see
whether
any
critic
or
artist
would
ever
stop
to
look
at
it
none
ever
did
unless
he
knew
the
story
adams
himself
never
wanted
to
know
more
about
it
he
refused
to
seek
further
light
he
never
cared
to
learn
whether
the
drawing
was
rafael
or
whether
the
verse
was
rafael
or
whether
even
the
was
rafael
the
experts
some
scores
of
them
including
the
british
museum
had
affirmed
that
the
drawing
was
worth
a
certain
moiety
of
twelve
shillings
on
that
point
also
adams
could
offer
no
opinion
but
he
was
clear
that
his
education
had
profited
by
it
to
that
extent
his
amusement
even
more
art
was
a
superb
field
for
education
but
at
every
turn
he
met
the
same
old
figure
like
a
battered
and
illegible
signpost
that
ought
to
direct
him
to
the
next
station
but
never
did
there
was
no
next
station
all
the
art
of
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
years
had
brought
england
to
stuff
which
palgrave
and
woolner
brayed
in
their
mortars
derided
tore
in
tatters
growled
at
and
howled
at
and
treated
in
terms
beyond
literary
usage
whistler
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
in
london
but
the
others
did
quite
as
well
what
result
could
a
student
reach
from
it
once
on
returning
to
london
dining
with
stopford
brooke
some
one
asked
adams
what
impression
the
royal
academy
exhibition
made
on
him
with
a
little
hesitation
he
suggested
that
it
was
rather
a
chaos
which
he
meant
for
civility
but
stopford
brooke
abruptly
met
it
by
asking
whether
chaos
were
not
better
than
death
truly
the
question
was
worth
discussion
for
his
own
part
adams
inclined
to
think
that
neither
chaos
nor
death
was
an
object
to
him
as
a
searcher
of
knowledge
neither
would
have
vogue
in
america
neither
would
help
him
to
a
career
both
of
them
led
him
away
from
his
objects
into
an
english
dilettante
museum
of
scraps
with
nothing
but
a
to
unite
them
in
any
relation
of
sequence
possibly
english
taste
was
one
degree
more
fatal
than
english
scholarship
but
even
this
question
was
open
to
argument
adams
went
to
the
sales
and
bought
what
he
was
told
to
buy
now
a
classical
drawing
by
rafael
or
rubens
now
a
by
girtin
or
cotman
if
possible
unfinished
because
it
was
more
likely
to
be
a
sketch
from
nature
and
he
bought
them
not
because
they
went
together
on
the
contrary
they
made
rather
awkward
spots
on
the
wall
as
they
did
on
the
mind
but
because
he
could
afford
to
buy
those
and
not
others
ten
pounds
did
not
go
far
to
buy
a
michael
angelo
but
was
a
great
deal
of
money
to
a
private
secretary
the
effect
was
spotty
fragmentary
feeble
and
the
more
so
because
the
british
mind
was
constructed
in
that
way
boasted
of
it
and
held
it
to
be
true
philosophy
as
well
as
sound
method
what
was
worse
no
one
had
a
right
to
denounce
the
english
as
wrong
artistically
their
mind
was
scrappy
and
every
one
knew
it
but
perhaps
thought
itself
history
and
nature
were
scrappy
and
ought
to
be
studied
so
turning
from
british
art
to
british
literature
one
met
the
same
dangers
the
historical
school
was
a
playground
of
traps
and
pitfalls
fatally
one
fell
into
the
sink
of
history
antiquarianism
for
one
who
nourished
a
natural
weakness
for
what
was
called
history
the
whole
of
british
literature
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
antiquarianism
or
anecdotage
for
no
one
except
buckle
had
tried
to
link
it
with
ideas
and
commonly
buckle
was
regarded
as
having
failed
macaulay
was
the
english
historian
adams
had
the
greatest
admiration
for
macaulay
but
he
felt
that
any
one
who
should
even
distantly
imitate
macaulay
would
perish
in
one
might
as
well
imitate
shakespeare
yet
evidently
something
was
wrong
here
for
the
poet
and
the
historian
ought
to
have
different
methods
and
method
ought
to
be
imitable
if
it
were
sound
yet
the
method
was
more
doubtful
than
the
style
he
was
a
dramatist
a
painter
a
poet
like
carlyle
this
was
the
english
mind
method
genius
or
whatever
one
might
call
it
but
one
never
could
quite
admit
that
the
method
which
ended
in
froude
and
kinglake
could
be
sound
for
america
where
passion
and
poetry
were
eccentricities
both
froude
and
kinglake
when
one
met
them
at
dinner
were
very
agreeable
very
intelligent
and
perhaps
the
english
method
was
right
and
art
fragmentary
by
essence
history
like
everything
else
might
be
a
field
of
scraps
like
the
refuse
about
a
staffordshire
one
felt
a
little
natural
reluctance
to
decline
and
fall
like
silas
wegg
on
the
golden
of
british
refuse
but
if
one
must
one
could
at
least
expect
a
degree
from
oxford
and
the
respect
of
the
athenaeum
club
while
drifting
after
the
war
ended
many
old
american
friends
came
abroad
for
a
holiday
and
among
the
rest
palfrey
busy
with
his
history
of
new
england
of
all
the
relics
of
childhood
palfrey
was
the
most
sympathetic
and
perhaps
the
more
so
because
he
too
had
wandered
into
the
pleasant
meadows
of
antiquarianism
and
had
forgotten
the
world
in
his
pursuit
of
the
new
england
puritan
although
america
seemed
becoming
more
and
more
indifferent
to
the
puritan
except
as
a
slightly
rococo
ornament
he
was
only
the
more
amusing
as
a
study
for
the
monkbarns
of
boston
bay
and
palfrey
took
him
seriously
as
his
clerical
education
required
his
work
was
rather
an
apologia
in
the
greek
sense
a
justification
of
the
ways
of
god
to
man
or
what
was
much
the
same
thing
of
puritans
to
other
men
and
the
task
of
justification
was
onerous
enough
to
require
the
occasional
relief
of
a
contrast
or
scapegoat
when
palfrey
happened
on
the
picturesque
but
unpuritanic
figure
of
captain
john
smith
he
felt
no
call
to
beautify
smith
picture
or
to
defend
his
moral
character
he
became
impartial
and
penetrating
the
famous
story
of
pocahontas
roused
his
latent
new
england
scepticism
he
suggested
to
adams
who
wanted
to
make
a
position
for
himself
that
an
article
in
the
north
american
review
on
captain
john
smith
relations
with
pocahontas
would
attract
as
much
attention
and
probably
break
as
much
glass
as
any
other
stone
that
could
be
thrown
by
a
beginner
adams
could
suggest
nothing
better
the
task
seemed
likely
to
be
amusing
so
he
planted
himself
in
the
british
museum
and
patiently
worked
over
all
the
material
he
could
find
until
at
last
after
three
or
four
months
of
labor
he
got
it
in
shape
and
sent
it
to
charles
norton
who
was
then
editing
the
north
american
norton
very
civilly
and
even
kindly
accepted
it
the
article
appeared
in
january
surely
here
was
something
to
ponder
over
as
a
step
in
education
something
that
tended
to
stagger
a
sceptic
in
spite
of
personal
wishes
intentions
and
prejudices
in
spite
of
civil
wars
and
diplomatic
education
in
spite
of
determination
to
be
actual
daily
and
practical
henry
adams
found
himself
at
still
in
english
society
dragged
on
one
side
into
english
dilettantism
which
of
all
dilettantism
he
held
the
most
futile
and
on
the
other
into
american
antiquarianism
which
of
all
antiquarianism
he
held
the
most
foolish
this
was
the
result
of
five
years
in
london
even
then
he
knew
it
to
be
a
false
start
he
had
wholly
lost
his
way
if
he
were
ever
to
amount
to
anything
he
must
begin
a
new
education
in
a
new
place
with
a
new
purpose
chapter
xv
darwinism
politics
diplomacy
law
art
and
history
had
opened
no
outlet
for
future
energy
or
effort
but
a
man
must
do
something
even
in
portland
place
when
winter
is
dark
and
winter
evenings
are
exceedingly
long
at
that
moment
darwin
was
convulsing
society
the
geological
champion
of
darwin
was
sir
charles
lyell
and
the
lyells
were
intimate
at
the
legation
sir
charles
constantly
said
of
darwin
what
palgrave
said
of
tennyson
that
the
first
time
he
came
to
town
adams
should
be
asked
to
meet
him
but
neither
of
them
ever
came
to
town
or
ever
cared
to
meet
a
young
american
and
one
could
not
go
to
them
because
they
were
known
to
dislike
intrusion
the
only
americans
who
were
not
allowed
to
intrude
were
the
in
the
legation
adams
was
content
to
read
darwin
especially
his
origin
of
species
and
his
voyage
of
the
beagle
he
was
a
darwinist
before
the
letter
a
predestined
follower
of
the
tide
but
he
was
hardly
trained
to
follow
darwin
evidences
fragmentary
the
british
mind
might
be
but
in
those
days
it
was
doing
a
great
deal
of
work
in
a
very
way
building
up
so
many
and
such
vast
theories
on
such
narrow
foundations
as
to
shock
the
conservative
and
delight
the
frivolous
the
atomic
theory
the
correlation
and
conservation
of
energy
the
mechanical
theory
of
the
universe
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
and
darwin
law
of
natural
selection
were
examples
of
what
a
young
man
had
to
take
on
trust
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
knew
enough
to
verify
them
in
his
ignorance
of
mathematics
he
was
particularly
helpless
but
this
never
stood
in
his
way
the
ideas
were
new
and
seemed
to
lead
somewhere
to
some
great
generalization
which
would
finish
one
clamor
to
be
educated
that
a
beginner
should
understand
them
all
or
believe
them
all
no
one
could
expect
still
less
exact
henry
adams
was
darwinist
because
it
was
easier
than
not
for
his
ignorance
exceeded
belief
and
one
must
know
something
in
order
to
contradict
even
such
triflers
as
tyndall
and
huxley
by
rights
he
should
have
been
also
a
marxist
but
some
narrow
trait
of
the
new
england
nature
seemed
to
blight
socialism
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
make
himself
a
convert
he
did
the
next
best
thing
he
became
a
comteist
within
the
limits
of
evolution
he
was
ready
to
become
anything
but
quiet
as
though
the
world
had
not
been
enough
upset
in
his
time
he
was
eager
to
see
it
upset
more
he
had
his
wish
but
he
lost
his
hold
on
the
results
by
trying
to
understand
them
he
never
tried
to
understand
darwin
but
he
still
fancied
he
might
get
the
best
part
of
darwinism
from
the
easier
study
of
geology
a
science
which
suited
idle
minds
as
well
as
though
it
were
history
every
curate
in
england
dabbled
in
geology
and
hunted
for
vestiges
of
creation
darwin
hunted
only
for
vestiges
of
natural
selection
and
adams
followed
him
although
he
cared
nothing
about
selection
unless
perhaps
for
the
indirect
amusement
of
upsetting
curates
he
felt
like
nine
men
in
ten
an
instinctive
belief
in
evolution
but
he
felt
no
more
concern
in
natural
than
in
unnatural
selection
though
he
seized
with
greediness
the
new
volume
on
the
antiquity
of
man
which
sir
charles
lyell
published
in
in
order
to
support
darwin
by
wrecking
the
garden
of
eden
sir
charles
next
brought
out
in
a
new
edition
of
his
principles
then
the
highest
of
geology
but
here
the
darwinian
doctrine
grew
in
stature
natural
selection
led
back
to
natural
evolution
and
at
last
to
natural
uniformity
this
was
a
vast
stride
unbroken
evolution
under
uniform
conditions
pleased
every
one
except
curates
and
bishops
it
was
the
very
best
substitute
for
religion
a
safe
conservative
practical
thoroughly
deity
such
a
working
system
for
the
universe
suited
a
young
man
who
had
just
helped
to
waste
five
or
ten
thousand
million
dollars
and
a
million
lives
more
or
less
to
enforce
unity
and
uniformity
on
people
who
objected
to
it
the
idea
was
only
too
seductive
in
its
perfection
it
had
the
charm
of
art
unity
and
uniformity
were
the
whole
motive
of
philosophy
and
if
darwin
like
a
true
englishman
preferred
to
back
into
it
to
reach
god
a
posteriori
rather
than
start
from
it
like
spinoza
the
difference
of
method
taught
only
the
moral
that
the
best
way
of
reaching
unity
was
to
unite
any
road
was
good
that
arrived
life
depended
on
it
one
had
been
from
the
first
dragged
hither
and
thither
like
a
french
poodle
on
a
string
following
always
the
strongest
pull
between
one
form
of
unity
or
centralization
and
another
the
proof
that
one
had
acted
wisely
because
of
obeying
the
primordial
habit
of
nature
flattered
one
steady
uniform
unbroken
evolution
from
lower
to
higher
seemed
easy
so
one
day
when
sir
charles
came
to
the
legation
to
inquire
about
getting
his
principles
properly
noticed
in
america
young
adams
found
nothing
simpler
than
to
suggest
that
he
could
do
it
himself
if
sir
charles
would
tell
him
what
to
say
youth
risks
such
encounters
with
the
universe
before
one
succumbs
to
it
yet
even
he
was
surprised
at
sir
charles
ready
assent
and
still
more
so
at
finding
himself
after
half
an
hour
conversation
sitting
down
to
clear
the
minds
of
american
geologists
about
the
principles
of
their
profession
this
was
getting
on
fast
arthur
pendennis
had
never
gone
so
far
the
geologists
were
a
hardy
class
not
likely
to
be
much
hurt
by
adams
learning
nor
did
he
throw
away
much
concern
on
their
account
he
undertook
the
task
chiefly
to
educate
not
them
but
himself
and
if
sir
isaac
newton
had
like
sir
charles
lyell
asked
him
to
explain
for
americans
his
last
edition
of
the
principia
adams
would
have
jumped
at
the
chance
unfortunately
the
mere
reading
such
works
for
amusement
is
quite
a
different
matter
from
studying
them
for
criticism
ignorance
must
always
begin
at
the
beginning
adams
must
inevitably
have
begun
by
asking
sir
isaac
for
an
intelligible
reason
why
the
apple
fell
to
the
ground
he
did
not
know
enough
to
be
satisfied
with
the
fact
the
law
of
gravitation
was
but
what
was
gravitation
and
he
would
have
been
thrown
quite
off
his
base
if
sir
isaac
had
answered
that
he
did
not
know
at
the
very
outset
adams
struck
on
sir
charles
glacial
theory
or
theories
he
was
ignorant
enough
to
think
that
the
glacial
epoch
looked
like
a
chasm
between
him
and
a
uniformitarian
world
if
the
glacial
period
were
uniformity
what
was
catastrophe
to
him
the
two
or
three
labored
guesses
that
sir
charles
suggested
or
borrowed
to
explain
glaciation
were
proof
of
nothing
and
were
quite
unsolid
as
support
for
so
immense
a
superstructure
as
geological
uniformity
if
one
were
at
liberty
to
be
as
lax
in
science
as
in
theology
and
to
assume
unity
from
the
start
one
might
better
say
so
as
the
church
did
and
not
invite
attack
by
appearing
weak
in
evidence
naturally
a
young
man
altogether
ignorant
could
not
say
this
to
sir
charles
lyell
or
sir
isaac
newton
but
he
was
forced
to
state
sir
charles
views
which
he
thought
weak
as
hypotheses
and
worthless
as
proofs
sir
charles
himself
seemed
shy
of
them
adams
hinted
his
heresies
in
vain
at
last
he
resorted
to
what
he
thought
the
bold
experiment
of
inserting
a
sentence
in
the
text
intended
to
provoke
correction
the
introduction
by
louis
agassiz
of
this
new
geological
agent
seemed
at
first
sight
inconsistent
with
sir
charles
argument
obliging
him
to
allow
that
causes
had
in
fact
existed
on
the
earth
capable
of
producing
more
violent
geological
changes
than
would
be
possible
in
our
own
day
the
hint
produced
no
effect
sir
charles
said
not
a
word
he
let
the
paragraph
stand
and
adams
never
knew
whether
the
great
uniformitarian
was
strict
or
lax
in
his
uniformitarian
creed
but
he
doubted
objections
fatal
to
one
mind
are
futile
to
another
and
as
far
as
concerned
the
article
the
matter
ended
there
although
the
glacial
epoch
remained
a
misty
region
in
the
young
man
darwinism
had
it
been
the
only
one
he
would
not
have
fretted
about
it
but
uniformity
often
worked
queerly
and
sometimes
did
not
work
as
natural
selection
at
all
finding
himself
at
a
loss
for
some
single
figure
to
illustrate
the
law
of
natural
selection
adams
asked
sir
charles
for
the
simplest
case
of
uniformity
on
record
much
to
his
surprise
sir
charles
told
him
that
certain
forms
like
terebratula
appeared
to
be
identical
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
geological
time
since
this
was
altogether
too
much
uniformity
and
much
too
little
selection
adams
gave
up
the
attempt
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tried
starting
at
the
end
himself
taking
for
granted
that
the
vertebrates
would
serve
his
purpose
he
asked
sir
charles
to
introduce
him
to
the
first
vertebrate
infinitely
to
his
bewilderment
sir
charles
informed
him
that
the
first
vertebrate
was
a
very
respectable
fish
among
the
earliest
of
all
fossils
which
had
lived
and
whose
bones
were
still
reposing
under
adams
own
favorite
abbey
on
wenlock
edge
by
this
time
in
adams
had
learned
to
know
shropshire
familiarly
and
it
was
the
part
of
his
diplomatic
education
which
he
loved
best
like
catherine
olney
in
northanger
abbey
he
yearned
for
nothing
so
keenly
as
to
feel
at
home
in
a
abbey
unless
it
were
to
haunt
a
prior
house
and
both
these
joys
were
his
at
wenlock
with
companions
or
without
he
never
tired
of
it
whether
he
rode
about
the
wrekin
or
visited
all
the
historical
haunts
from
ludlow
castle
and
stokesay
to
boscobel
and
uriconium
or
followed
the
roman
road
or
scratched
in
the
abbey
ruins
all
was
amusing
and
carried
a
flavor
of
its
own
like
that
of
the
roman
campagna
but
perhaps
he
liked
best
to
ramble
over
the
edge
on
a
summer
afternoon
and
look
across
the
marches
to
the
mountains
of
wales
the
peculiar
flavor
of
the
scenery
has
something
to
do
with
absence
of
evolution
it
was
better
marked
in
egypt
it
was
felt
wherever
became
interchangeable
one
instinct
abhors
time
as
one
lay
on
the
slope
of
the
edge
looking
sleepily
through
the
summer
haze
towards
shrewsbury
or
cader
idris
or
caer
caradoc
or
uriconium
nothing
suggested
sequence
the
roman
road
was
twin
to
the
railroad
uriconium
was
well
worth
shrewsbury
wenlock
and
buildwas
were
far
superior
to
bridgnorth
the
shepherds
of
caractacus
or
offa
or
the
monks
of
buildwas
had
they
approached
where
he
lay
in
the
grass
would
have
taken
him
only
for
another
and
tamer
variety
of
welsh
thief
they
would
have
seen
little
to
surprise
them
in
the
modern
landscape
unless
it
were
the
steam
of
a
distant
railway
one
might
mix
up
the
terms
of
time
as
one
liked
or
stuff
the
present
anywhere
into
the
past
measuring
time
by
falstaff
shrewsbury
clock
without
violent
sense
of
wrong
as
one
could
do
it
on
the
pacific
ocean
but
the
triumph
of
all
was
to
look
south
along
the
edge
to
the
abode
of
one
earliest
ancestor
and
nearest
relative
the
ganoid
fish
whose
name
according
to
professor
huxley
was
pteraspis
a
cousin
of
the
sturgeon
and
whose
kingdom
according
to
sir
roderick
murchison
was
called
siluria
life
began
and
ended
there
behind
that
horizon
lay
only
the
cambrian
without
vertebrates
or
any
other
organism
except
a
few
on
the
further
verge
of
the
cambrian
rose
the
crystalline
rocks
from
which
every
trace
of
organic
existence
had
been
erased
that
here
on
the
wenlock
edge
of
time
a
young
american
seeking
only
frivolous
amusement
should
find
a
legitimate
parentage
as
modern
as
though
just
caught
in
the
severn
below
astonished
him
as
much
as
though
he
had
found
darwin
himself
in
the
scale
of
evolution
one
vertebrate
was
as
good
as
another
for
anything
he
or
any
one
else
knew
nine
hundred
and
ninety
nine
parts
of
evolution
out
of
a
thousand
lay
behind
or
below
the
pteraspis
to
an
american
in
search
of
a
father
it
mattered
nothing
whether
the
father
breathed
through
lungs
or
walked
on
fins
or
on
feet
evolution
of
mind
was
altogether
another
matter
and
belonged
to
another
science
but
whether
one
traced
descent
from
the
shark
or
the
wolf
was
immaterial
even
in
morals
this
matter
had
been
discussed
for
ages
without
scientific
result
la
fontaine
and
other
fabulists
maintained
that
the
wolf
even
in
morals
stood
higher
than
man
and
in
view
of
the
late
civil
war
adams
had
doubts
of
his
own
on
the
facts
of
moral
evolution
tout
bien
considere
je
te
soutiens
en
somme
que
scelerat
pour
scelerat
il
vaut
mieux
etre
un
loup
homme
it
might
well
be
at
all
events
it
did
not
enter
into
the
problem
of
pteraspis
for
it
was
quite
certain
that
no
complete
proof
of
natural
selection
had
occurred
back
to
the
time
of
pteraspis
and
that
before
pteraspis
was
eternal
void
no
trace
of
any
vertebrate
had
been
found
there
only
starfish
polyps
or
trilobites
whose
kindly
descendants
he
had
often
bathed
with
as
a
child
on
the
shores
of
quincy
bay
that
pteraspis
and
shark
were
his
cousins
or
grandfathers
in
no
way
troubled
him
but
that
either
or
both
of
them
should
be
older
than
evolution
itself
seemed
to
him
perplexing
nor
could
he
at
all
simplify
the
problem
by
taking
the
sudden
into
quincy
bay
in
search
of
the
fascinating
creature
he
had
called
a
horseshoe
whose
huge
dome
of
shell
and
sharp
spur
of
tail
had
so
alarmed
him
as
a
child
in
siluria
he
understood
sir
roderick
murchison
called
the
horseshoe
a
limulus
which
helped
nothing
neither
in
the
limulus
nor
in
the
terebratula
nor
in
the
cestracion
philippi
any
more
than
in
the
pteraspis
could
one
conceive
an
ancestor
but
if
one
must
the
choice
mattered
little
cousinship
had
limits
but
no
one
knew
enough
to
fix
them
when
the
vertebrate
vanished
in
siluria
it
disappeared
instantly
and
forever
neither
vertebra
nor
scale
nor
print
reappeared
nor
any
trace
of
ascent
or
descent
to
a
lower
type
the
vertebrate
began
in
the
ludlow
shale
as
complete
as
adams
himself
in
some
respects
more
so
at
the
top
of
the
column
of
organic
evolution
and
geology
offered
no
sort
of
proof
that
he
had
ever
been
anything
else
ponder
over
it
as
he
might
adams
could
see
nothing
in
the
theory
of
sir
charles
but
pure
inference
precisely
like
the
inference
of
paley
that
if
one
found
a
watch
one
inferred
a
maker
he
could
detect
no
more
evolution
in
life
since
the
pteraspis
than
he
could
detect
it
in
architecture
since
the
abbey
all
he
could
prove
was
change
alone
asserted
evolution
of
power
and
only
by
violence
could
be
forced
to
assert
selection
of
type
all
this
seemed
trivial
to
the
true
darwinian
and
to
sir
charles
it
was
mere
defect
in
the
geological
record
sir
charles
labored
only
to
heap
up
the
evidences
of
evolution
to
cumulate
them
till
the
mass
became
irresistible
with
that
purpose
adams
gladly
studied
and
tried
to
help
sir
charles
but
behind
the
lesson
of
the
day
he
was
conscious
that
in
geology
as
in
theology
he
could
prove
only
evolution
that
did
not
evolve
uniformity
that
was
not
uniform
and
selection
that
did
not
select
to
other
darwinians
except
darwin
natural
selection
seemed
a
dogma
to
be
put
in
the
place
of
the
athanasian
creed
it
was
a
form
of
religious
hope
a
promise
of
ultimate
perfection
adams
wished
no
better
he
warmly
sympathized
in
the
object
but
when
he
came
to
ask
himself
what
he
truly
thought
he
felt
that
he
had
no
faith
that
whenever
the
next
new
hobby
should
be
brought
out
he
should
surely
drop
off
from
darwinism
like
a
monkey
from
a
perch
that
the
idea
of
one
form
law
order
or
sequence
had
no
more
value
for
him
than
the
idea
of
none
that
what
he
valued
most
was
motion
and
that
what
attracted
his
mind
was
change
psychology
was
to
him
a
new
study
and
a
dark
corner
of
education
as
he
lay
on
wenlock
edge
with
the
sheep
nibbling
the
grass
close
about
him
as
they
or
their
betters
had
nibbled
the
grass
or
whatever
there
was
to
nibble
in
the
silurian
kingdom
of
pteraspis
he
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
an
evolution
far
more
wonderful
than
that
of
fishes
he
did
not
like
it
he
could
not
account
for
it
and
he
determined
to
stop
it
never
since
the
days
of
his
limulus
ancestry
had
any
of
his
ascendants
thought
thus
their
modes
of
thought
might
be
many
but
their
thought
was
one
out
of
his
millions
of
millions
of
ancestors
back
to
the
cambrian
mollusks
every
one
had
probably
lived
and
died
in
the
illusion
of
truths
which
did
not
amuse
him
and
which
had
never
changed
henry
adams
was
the
first
in
an
infinite
series
to
discover
and
admit
to
himself
that
he
really
did
not
care
whether
truth
was
or
was
not
true
he
did
not
even
care
that
it
should
be
proved
true
unless
the
process
were
new
and
amusing
he
was
a
darwinian
for
fun
from
the
beginning
of
history
this
attitude
had
been
branded
as
criminal
worse
than
crime
sacrilege
society
punished
it
ferociously
and
justly
in
adams
the
father
looked
on
it
as
moral
weakness
it
annoyed
him
but
it
did
not
annoy
him
nearly
so
much
as
it
annoyed
his
son
who
had
no
need
to
learn
from
hamlet
the
fatal
effect
of
the
pale
cast
of
thought
on
enterprises
great
or
small
he
had
no
notion
of
letting
the
currents
of
his
action
be
turned
awry
by
this
form
of
conscience
to
him
the
current
of
his
time
was
to
be
his
current
lead
where
it
might
he
put
psychology
under
lock
and
key
he
insisted
on
maintaining
his
absolute
standards
on
aiming
at
ultimate
unity
the
mania
for
handling
all
the
sides
of
every
question
looking
into
every
window
and
opening
every
door
was
as
bluebeard
judiciously
pointed
out
to
his
wives
fatal
to
their
practical
usefulness
in
society
one
could
not
stop
to
chase
doubts
as
though
they
were
rabbits
one
had
no
time
to
paint
and
putty
the
surface
of
law
even
though
it
were
cracked
and
rotten
for
the
young
men
whose
lives
were
cast
in
the
generation
between
and
law
should
be
evolution
from
lower
to
higher
aggregation
of
the
atom
in
the
mass
concentration
of
multiplicity
in
unity
compulsion
of
anarchy
in
order
and
he
would
force
himself
to
follow
wherever
it
led
though
he
should
sacrifice
five
thousand
millions
more
in
money
and
a
million
more
lives
as
the
path
ultimately
led
it
sacrificed
much
more
than
this
but
at
the
time
he
thought
the
price
he
named
a
high
one
and
he
could
not
foresee
that
science
and
society
would
desert
him
in
paying
it
he
at
least
took
his
education
as
a
darwinian
in
good
faith
the
church
was
gone
and
duty
was
dim
but
will
should
take
its
place
founded
deeply
in
interest
and
law
this
was
the
result
of
five
or
six
years
in
england
a
result
so
british
as
to
be
almost
the
equivalent
of
an
oxford
degree
quite
serious
about
it
he
set
to
work
at
once
while
confusing
his
ideas
about
geology
to
the
apparent
satisfaction
of
sir
charles
who
left
him
his
in
token
of
it
adams
turned
resolutely
to
business
and
attacked
the
burning
question
of
specie
payments
his
principles
assured
him
that
the
honest
way
to
resume
payments
was
to
restrict
currency
he
thought
he
might
win
a
name
among
financiers
and
statesmen
at
home
by
showing
how
this
task
had
been
done
by
england
after
the
classical
suspension
of
setting
himself
to
the
study
of
this
perplexed
period
he
waded
as
well
as
he
could
through
a
morass
of
volumes
pamphlets
and
debates
until
he
learned
to
his
confusion
that
the
bank
of
england
itself
and
all
the
best
british
financial
writers
held
that
restriction
was
a
fatal
mistake
and
that
the
best
treatment
of
a
debased
currency
was
to
let
it
alone
as
the
bank
had
in
fact
done
time
and
patience
were
the
remedies
the
shock
of
this
discovery
to
his
financial
principles
was
serious
much
more
serious
than
the
shock
of
the
terebratula
and
pteraspis
to
his
principles
of
geology
a
mistake
about
evolution
was
not
fatal
a
mistake
about
specie
payments
would
destroy
forever
the
last
hope
of
employment
in
state
street
six
months
of
patient
labor
would
be
thrown
away
if
he
did
not
publish
and
with
it
his
whole
scheme
of
making
himself
a
position
as
a
practical
if
he
did
publish
how
could
he
tell
virtuous
bankers
in
state
street
that
moral
and
absolute
principles
of
abstract
truth
such
as
theirs
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
and
that
they
had
better
let
it
alone
geologists
naturally
a
humble
and
helpless
class
might
not
revenge
impertinences
offered
to
their
science
but
capitalists
never
forgot
or
forgave
with
labor
and
caution
he
made
one
long
article
on
british
finance
in
and
another
on
the
bank
restriction
of
and
doing
both
up
in
one
package
he
sent
it
to
the
north
american
for
choice
he
knew
that
two
heavy
technical
financial
studies
thus
thrown
at
an
editor
head
would
probably
return
to
crush
the
author
but
the
audacity
of
youth
is
more
sympathetic
when
successful
than
his
ignorance
the
editor
accepted
both
when
the
post
brought
his
letter
adams
looked
at
it
as
though
he
were
a
debtor
who
had
begged
for
an
extension
he
read
it
with
as
much
relief
as
the
debtor
if
it
had
brought
him
the
loan
the
letter
gave
the
new
writer
literary
rank
henceforward
he
had
the
freedom
of
the
press
these
articles
following
those
on
pocahontas
and
lyell
enrolled
him
on
the
permanent
staff
of
the
north
american
review
precisely
what
this
rank
was
worth
no
one
could
say
but
for
fifty
years
the
north
american
review
had
been
the
stage
coach
which
carried
literary
bostonians
to
such
distinction
as
they
had
achieved
few
writers
had
ideas
which
warranted
thirty
pages
of
development
but
for
such
as
thought
they
had
the
review
alone
offered
space
an
article
was
a
small
volume
which
required
at
least
three
months
work
and
was
paid
at
best
five
dollars
a
page
not
many
men
even
in
england
or
france
could
write
a
good
article
and
practically
no
one
in
america
read
them
but
a
few
score
of
people
mostly
in
search
of
items
to
steal
ran
over
the
pages
to
extract
an
idea
or
a
fact
which
was
a
sort
of
wild
game
a
bluefish
or
a
teal
worth
anywhere
from
fifty
cents
to
five
dollars
newspaper
writers
had
their
eye
on
quarterly
pickings
the
circulation
of
the
review
had
never
exceeded
three
or
four
hundred
copies
and
the
review
had
never
paid
its
reasonable
expenses
yet
it
stood
at
the
head
of
american
literary
periodicals
it
was
a
source
of
suggestion
to
cheaper
workers
it
reached
far
into
societies
that
never
knew
its
existence
it
was
an
organ
worth
playing
on
and
in
the
fancy
of
henry
adams
it
led
in
some
indistinct
future
to
playing
on
a
new
york
daily
newspaper
with
the
editor
letter
under
his
eyes
adams
asked
himself
what
better
he
could
have
done
on
the
whole
considering
his
helplessness
he
thought
he
had
done
as
well
as
his
neighbors
no
one
could
yet
guess
which
of
his
contemporaries
was
most
likely
to
play
a
part
in
the
great
world
a
shrewd
prophet
in
wall
street
might
perhaps
have
set
a
mark
on
pierpont
morgan
but
hardly
on
the
rockefellers
or
william
whitney
or
whitelaw
reid
no
one
would
have
picked
out
william
mckinley
or
john
hay
or
mark
hanna
for
great
statesmen
boston
was
ignorant
of
the
careers
in
store
for
alexander
agassiz
and
henry
higginson
phillips
brooks
was
unknown
henry
james
was
unheard
howells
was
new
richardson
and
lafarge
were
struggling
for
a
start
out
of
any
score
of
names
and
reputations
that
should
reach
beyond
the
century
the
who
were
starting
in
the
year
could
show
none
that
was
so
far
in
advance
as
to
warrant
odds
in
its
favor
the
army
men
had
for
the
most
part
fallen
to
the
ranks
had
adams
foreseen
the
future
exactly
as
it
came
he
would
have
been
no
wiser
and
could
have
chosen
no
better
path
thus
it
turned
out
that
the
last
year
in
england
was
the
pleasantest
he
was
already
old
in
society
and
belonged
to
the
silurian
horizon
the
prince
of
wales
had
come
disraeli
lord
stanley
and
the
future
lord
salisbury
had
thrown
into
the
background
the
memories
of
palmerston
and
russell
europe
was
moving
rapidly
and
the
conduct
of
england
during
the
american
civil
war
was
the
last
thing
that
london
liked
to
recall
the
revolution
since
was
nearly
complete
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
american
felt
himself
almost
as
strong
as
an
englishman
he
had
thirty
years
to
wait
before
he
should
feel
himself
stronger
meanwhile
even
a
private
secretary
could
afford
to
be
happy
his
old
education
was
finished
his
new
one
was
not
begun
he
still
loitered
a
year
feeling
himself
near
the
end
of
a
very
long
anxious
tempestuous
successful
voyage
with
another
to
follow
and
a
summer
sea
between
he
made
what
use
he
could
of
it
in
february
he
was
back
in
rome
with
his
friend
milnes
gaskell
for
another
season
he
wandered
on
horseback
over
the
campagna
or
on
foot
through
the
rome
of
the
middle
ages
and
sat
once
more
on
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
as
had
become
with
him
almost
a
superstition
like
the
waters
of
the
fountain
of
trevi
rome
was
still
tragic
and
solemn
as
ever
with
its
mediaeval
society
artistic
literary
and
clerical
taking
itself
as
seriously
as
in
the
days
of
byron
and
shelley
the
long
ten
years
of
accidental
education
had
changed
nothing
for
him
there
he
knew
no
more
in
than
in
he
had
learned
nothing
whatever
that
made
rome
more
intelligible
to
him
or
made
life
easier
to
handle
the
case
was
no
better
when
he
got
back
to
london
and
went
through
his
last
season
london
had
become
his
vice
he
loved
his
haunts
his
houses
his
habits
and
even
his
hansom
cabs
he
loved
growling
like
an
englishman
and
going
into
society
where
he
knew
not
a
face
and
cared
not
a
straw
he
lived
deep
into
the
lives
and
loves
and
disappointments
of
his
friends
when
at
last
he
found
himself
back
again
at
liverpool
his
heart
wrenched
by
the
act
of
parting
he
moved
mechanically
unstrung
but
he
had
no
more
acquired
education
than
when
he
first
trod
the
steps
of
the
adelphi
hotel
in
november
he
could
see
only
one
great
change
and
this
was
wholly
in
years
eaton
hall
no
longer
impressed
his
imagination
even
the
architecture
of
chester
roused
but
a
sleepy
interest
he
felt
no
sensation
whatever
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
british
peerage
but
mainly
an
habitual
dislike
to
most
of
the
people
who
frequented
their
country
houses
he
had
become
english
to
the
point
of
sharing
their
petty
social
divisions
their
dislikes
and
prejudices
against
each
other
he
took
england
no
longer
with
the
awe
of
american
youth
but
with
the
habit
of
an
old
and
rather
worn
suit
of
clothes
as
far
as
he
knew
this
was
all
that
englishmen
meant
by
social
education
but
in
any
case
it
was
all
the
education
he
had
gained
from
seven
years
in
london
chapter

the
press
at
ten
of
a
july
night
in
heat
that
made
the
tropical
simmer
the
adams
family
and
the
motley
family
clambered
down
the
side
of
their
cunard
steamer
into
the
government
tugboat
which
set
them
ashore
in
black
darkness
at
the
end
of
some
north
river
pier
had
they
been
tyrian
traders
of
the
year
landing
from
a
galley
fresh
from
gibraltar
they
could
hardly
have
been
stranger
on
the
shore
of
a
world
so
changed
from
what
it
had
been
ten
years
before
the
historian
of
the
dutch
no
longer
historian
but
diplomatist
started
up
an
unknown
street
in
company
with
the
private
secretary
who
had
become
private
citizen
in
search
of
carriages
to
convey
the
two
parties
to
the
brevoort
house
the
pursuit
was
arduous
but
successful
towards
midnight
they
found
shelter
once
more
in
their
native
land
how
much
its
character
had
changed
or
was
changing
they
could
not
wholly
know
and
they
could
but
partly
feel
for
that
matter
the
land
itself
knew
no
more
than
they
society
in
america
was
always
trying
almost
as
blindly
as
an
earthworm
to
realize
and
understand
itself
to
catch
up
with
its
own
head
and
to
twist
about
in
search
of
its
tail
society
offered
the
profile
of
a
long
straggling
caravan
stretching
loosely
towards
the
prairies
its
few
score
of
leaders
far
in
advance
and
its
millions
of
immigrants
negroes
and
indians
far
in
the
rear
somewhere
in
archaic
time
it
enjoyed
the
vast
advantage
over
europe
that
all
seemed
for
the
moment
to
move
in
one
direction
while
europe
wasted
most
of
its
energy
in
trying
several
contradictory
movements
at
once
but
whenever
europe
or
asia
should
be
polarized
or
oriented
towards
the
same
point
america
might
easily
lose
her
lead
meanwhile
each
newcomer
needed
to
slip
into
a
place
as
near
the
head
of
the
caravan
as
possible
and
needed
most
to
know
where
the
leaders
could
be
found
one
could
divine
pretty
nearly
where
the
force
lay
since
the
last
ten
years
had
given
to
the
great
mechanical
energies
coal
iron
steam
a
distinct
superiority
in
power
over
the
old
industrial
elements
agriculture
handwork
and
learning
but
the
result
of
this
revolution
on
a
survivor
from
the
fifties
resembled
the
action
of
the
earthworm
he
twisted
about
in
vain
to
recover
his
he
could
no
longer
see
his
own
trail
he
had
become
an
estray
a
flotsam
or
jetsam
of
wreckage
a
belated
reveller
or
a
like
matthew
arnold
his
world
was
dead
not
a
polish
jew
fresh
from
warsaw
or
cracow
not
a
furtive
yacoob
or
ysaac
still
reeking
of
the
ghetto
snarling
a
weird
yiddish
to
the
officers
of
the
customs
but
had
a
keener
instinct
an
intenser
energy
and
a
freer
hand
than
he
american
of
americans
with
heaven
knew
how
many
puritans
and
patriots
behind
him
and
an
education
that
had
cost
a
civil
war
he
made
no
complaint
and
found
no
fault
with
his
time
he
was
no
worse
off
than
the
indians
or
the
buffalo
who
had
been
ejected
from
their
heritage
by
his
own
people
but
he
vehemently
insisted
that
he
was
not
himself
at
fault
the
defeat
was
not
due
to
him
nor
yet
to
any
superiority
of
his
rivals
he
had
been
unfairly
forced
out
of
the
track
and
must
get
back
into
it
as
best
he
could
one
comfort
he
could
enjoy
to
the
full
little
as
he
might
be
fitted
for
the
work
that
was
before
him
he
had
only
to
look
at
his
father
and
motley
to
see
figures
less
fitted
for
it
than
he
all
were
equally
survivals
from
the
forties
from
the
time
of
louis
philippe
stylists
doctrinaires
ornaments
that
had
been
more
or
less
suited
to
the
colonial
architecture
but
which
never
had
much
value
in
desbrosses
street
or
fifth
avenue
they
could
scarcely
have
earned
five
dollars
a
day
in
any
modern
industry
the
men
who
commanded
high
pay
were
as
a
rule
not
ornamental
even
commodore
vanderbilt
and
jay
gould
lacked
social
charm
doubtless
the
country
needed
ornament
needed
it
very
badly
indeed
but
it
needed
energy
still
more
and
capital
most
of
all
for
its
supply
was
ridiculously
out
of
proportion
to
its
wants
on
the
new
scale
of
power
merely
to
make
the
continent
habitable
for
civilized
people
would
require
an
immediate
outlay
that
would
have
bankrupted
the
world
as
yet
no
portion
of
the
world
except
a
few
narrow
stretches
of
western
europe
had
ever
been
tolerably
provided
with
the
essentials
of
comfort
and
convenience
to
fit
out
an
entire
continent
with
roads
and
the
decencies
of
life
would
exhaust
the
credit
of
the
entire
planet
such
an
estimate
seemed
outrageous
to
a
texan
member
of
congress
who
loved
the
simplicity
of
nature
noblemen
but
the
mere
suggestion
that
a
sun
existed
above
him
would
outrage
the
of
a
fish
that
carried
a
lantern
on
the
end
of
its
nose
from
the
moment
that
railways
were
introduced
life
took
on
extravagance
thus
the
belated
reveller
who
landed
in
the
dark
at
the
desbrosses
street
ferry
found
his
energies
exhausted
in
the
effort
to
see
his
own
length
the
new
americans
of
whom
he
was
to
be
one
must
whether
they
were
fit
or
unfit
create
a
world
of
their
own
a
science
a
society
a
philosophy
a
universe
where
they
had
not
yet
created
a
road
or
even
learned
to
dig
their
own
iron
they
had
no
time
for
thought
they
saw
and
could
see
nothing
beyond
their
day
work
their
attitude
to
the
universe
outside
them
was
that
of
the
fish
above
all
they
naturally
and
intensely
disliked
to
be
told
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
by
men
who
took
their
ideas
and
their
methods
from
the
abstract
theories
of
history
philosophy
or
theology
they
knew
enough
to
know
that
their
world
was
one
of
energies
quite
new
all
this
the
newcomer
understood
and
accepted
since
he
could
not
help
himself
and
saw
that
the
american
could
help
himself
as
little
as
the
newcomer
but
the
fact
remained
that
the
more
he
knew
the
less
he
was
educated
society
knew
as
much
as
this
and
seemed
rather
inclined
to
boast
of
it
at
least
on
the
stump
but
the
leaders
of
industry
betrayed
no
sentiment
popular
or
other
they
used
without
qualm
whatever
instruments
they
found
at
hand
they
had
been
obliged
in
to
turn
aside
and
waste
immense
energy
in
settling
what
had
been
settled
a
thousand
years
before
and
should
never
have
been
revived
at
prodigious
expense
by
sheer
force
they
broke
resistance
down
leaving
everything
but
the
mere
fact
of
power
untouched
since
nothing
else
had
a
solution
race
and
thought
were
beyond
reach
having
cleared
its
path
so
far
society
went
back
to
its
work
and
threw
itself
on
that
which
stood
first
its
roads
the
field
was
vast
altogether
beyond
its
power
to
control
offhand
and
society
dropped
every
thought
of
dealing
with
anything
more
than
the
single
fraction
called
a
railway
system
this
relatively
small
part
of
its
task
was
still
so
big
as
to
need
the
energies
of
a
generation
for
it
required
all
the
new
machinery
to
be
created
capital
banks
mines
furnaces
shops
technical
knowledge
mechanical
population
together
with
a
steady
remodelling
of
social
and
political
habits
ideas
and
institutions
to
fit
the
new
scale
and
suit
the
new
conditions
the
generation
between
and
was
already
mortgaged
to
the
railways
and
no
one
knew
it
better
than
the
generation
itself
whether
henry
adams
knew
it
or
not
he
knew
enough
to
act
as
though
he
did
he
reached
quincy
once
more
ready
for
the
new
start
his
brother
charles
had
determined
to
strike
for
the
railroads
henry
was
to
strike
for
the
press
and
they
hoped
to
play
into
each
hands
they
had
great
need
for
they
found
no
one
else
to
play
with
after
discovering
the
worthlessness
of
a
education
they
had
still
to
discover
the
worthlessness
of
social
connection
no
young
man
had
a
larger
acquaintance
and
relationship
than
henry
adams
yet
he
knew
no
one
who
could
help
him
he
was
for
sale
in
the
open
market
so
were
many
of
his
friends
all
the
world
knew
it
and
knew
too
that
they
were
cheap
to
be
bought
at
the
price
of
a
mechanic
there
was
no
concealment
no
delicacy
and
no
illusion
about
it
neither
he
nor
his
friends
complained
but
he
felt
sometimes
a
little
surprised
that
as
far
as
he
knew
no
one
seeking
in
the
labor
market
ever
so
much
as
inquired
about
their
fitness
the
want
of
solidarity
between
old
and
young
seemed
american
the
young
man
was
required
to
impose
himself
by
the
usual
business
methods
as
a
necessity
on
his
elders
in
order
to
compel
them
to
buy
him
as
an
investment
as
adams
felt
it
he
was
in
a
manner
expected
to
blackmail
many
a
young
man
complained
to
him
in
after
life
of
the
same
experience
which
became
a
matter
of
curious
reflection
as
he
grew
old
the
labor
market
of
good
society
was
boston
seemed
to
offer
no
market
for
educated
labor
a
peculiar
and
perplexing
amalgam
boston
always
was
and
although
it
had
changed
much
in
ten
years
it
was
not
less
perplexing
one
no
longer
dined
at
two
one
could
no
longer
skate
on
back
bay
one
heard
talk
of
bostonians
worth
five
millions
or
more
as
something
not
incredible
yet
the
place
seemed
still
simple
and
less
than
ever
before
in
the
line
that
adams
had
chosen
to
follow
he
needed
more
than
all
else
the
help
of
the
press
but
any
shadow
of
hope
on
that
side
vanished
instantly
the
less
one
meddled
with
the
boston
press
the
better
all
the
newspapermen
were
clear
on
that
point
the
same
was
true
of
politics
boston
meant
business
the
bostonians
were
building
railways
adams
would
have
liked
to
help
in
building
railways
but
had
no
education
he
was
not
fit
he
passed
three
or
four
months
thus
visiting
relations
renewing
friendships
and
studying
the
situation
at
thirty
years
old
the
man
who
has
not
yet
got
further
than
to
study
the
situation
is
lost
or
near
it
he
could
see
nothing
in
the
situation
that
could
be
of
use
to
him
his
friends
had
won
no
more
from
it
than
he
his
brother
charles
after
three
years
of
civil
life
was
no
better
off
than
himself
except
for
being
married
and
in
greater
need
of
income
his
brother
john
had
become
a
brilliant
political
leader
on
the
wrong
side
no
one
had
yet
regained
the
lost
ground
of
the
war
he
went
to
newport
and
tried
to
be
fashionable
but
even
in
the
simple
life
of
he
failed
as
fashion
all
the
style
he
had
learned
so
painfully
in
london
was
worse
than
useless
in
america
where
every
standard
was
different
newport
was
charming
but
it
asked
for
no
education
and
gave
none
what
it
gave
was
much
gayer
and
pleasanter
and
one
enjoyed
it
amazingly
but
friendships
in
that
society
were
a
kind
of
social
partnership
like
the
classes
at
college
not
education
but
the
subjects
of
education
all
were
doing
the
same
thing
and
asking
the
same
question
of
the
future
none
could
help
society
seemed
founded
on
the
law
that
all
was
for
the
best
new
yorkers
in
the
best
of
newports
and
that
all
young
people
were
rich
if
they
could
waltz
it
was
a
new
version
of
the
ant
and
grasshopper
at
the
end
of
three
months
the
only
person
among
the
hundreds
he
had
met
who
had
offered
him
a
word
of
encouragement
or
had
shown
a
sign
of
acquaintance
with
his
doings
was
edward
atkinson
boston
was
cool
towards
sons
whether
prodigals
or
other
and
needed
much
time
to
make
up
its
mind
what
to
do
for
them
time
which
adams
at
thirty
years
old
could
hardly
spare
he
had
not
the
courage
or
to
hire
an
office
in
state
street
as
so
many
of
his
friends
did
and
doze
there
alone
vacuity
within
and
a
snowstorm
outside
waiting
for
fortune
to
knock
at
the
door
or
hoping
to
find
her
asleep
in
the
elevator
or
on
the
staircase
since
elevators
were
not
yet
in
use
whether
this
course
would
have
offered
his
best
chance
he
never
knew
it
was
one
of
the
points
in
practical
education
which
most
needed
a
clear
understanding
and
he
could
never
reach
it
his
father
and
mother
would
have
been
glad
to
see
him
stay
with
them
and
begin
reading
blackstone
again
and
he
showed
no
very
filial
tenderness
by
abruptly
breaking
the
tie
that
had
lasted
so
long
after
all
perhaps
beacon
street
was
as
good
as
any
other
street
for
his
objects
in
life
possibly
his
easiest
and
surest
path
was
from
beacon
street
to
state
street
and
back
again
all
the
days
of
his
years
who
could
tell
even
after
life
was
over
the
doubt
could
not
be
determined
in
thus
sacrificing
his
heritage
he
only
followed
the
path
that
had
led
him
from
the
beginning
boston
was
full
of
his
brothers
he
had
reckoned
from
childhood
on
outlawry
as
his
peculiar
birthright
the
mere
thought
of
beginning
life
again
in
mount
vernon
street
lowered
the
pulsations
of
his
heart
this
is
a
story
of
education
not
a
mere
lesson
of
life
and
with
education
temperament
has
in
strictness
nothing
to
do
although
in
practice
they
run
close
together
neither
by
temperament
nor
by
education
was
he
fitted
for
boston
he
had
drifted
far
away
and
behind
his
companions
there
no
one
trusted
his
temperament
or
education
he
had
to
go
since
no
other
path
seemed
to
offer
itself
he
stuck
to
his
plan
of
joining
the
press
and
selected
washington
as
the
shortest
road
to
new
york
but
in
washington
stood
outside
the
social
pale
no
bostonian
had
ever
gone
there
one
announced
one
self
as
an
adventurer
and
an
a
person
of
deplorably
bad
judgment
and
the
charges
were
true
the
chances
of
ending
in
the
gutter
were
at
best
even
the
risk
was
the
greater
in
adams
case
because
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
what
to
do
when
he
got
there
that
he
must
educate
himself
over
again
for
objects
quite
new
in
an
air
altogether
hostile
to
his
old
educations
was
the
only
certainty
but
how
he
was
to
do
it
how
he
was
to
convert
the
idler
in
rotten
row
into
the
lobbyist
of
the
capital
he
had
not
an
idea
and
no
one
to
teach
him
the
question
of
money
is
rarely
serious
for
a
young
american
unless
he
is
married
and
money
never
troubled
adams
more
than
others
not
because
he
had
it
but
because
he
could
do
without
it
like
most
people
in
washington
who
all
lived
on
the
income
of
bricklayers
but
with
or
without
money
he
met
the
difficulty
that
after
getting
to
washington
in
order
to
go
on
the
press
it
was
necessary
to
seek
a
press
to
go
on
for
large
work
he
could
count
on
the
north
american
review
but
this
was
scarcely
a
press
for
current
discussion
and
correspondence
he
could
depend
on
the
new
york
nation
but
what
he
needed
was
a
new
york
daily
and
no
new
york
daily
needed
him
he
lost
his
one
chance
by
the
death
of
henry
raymond
the
tribune
under
horace
greeley
was
out
of
the
question
both
for
political
and
personal
reasons
and
because
whitelaw
reid
had
already
undertaken
that
singularly
venturesome
position
amid
difficulties
that
would
have
swamped
adams
in
hours
charles
dana
had
made
the
sun
a
very
successful
as
well
as
a
very
amusing
paper
but
had
hurt
his
own
social
position
in
doing
it
and
adams
knew
himself
well
enough
to
know
that
he
could
never
please
himself
and
dana
too
with
the
best
intentions
he
must
always
fail
as
a
blackguard
and
at
that
time
a
strong
dash
of
blackguardism
was
life
to
the
sun
as
for
the
new
york
herald
it
was
a
despotic
empire
admitting
no
personality
but
that
of
bennett
thus
for
the
moment
the
new
york
daily
press
offered
no
field
except
the
holy
land
of
the
evening
post
under
william
cullen
bryant
while
beside
it
lay
only
the
elevated
plateau
of
the
new
jerusalem
occupied
by
godkin
and
the
nation
much
as
adams
liked
godkin
and
glad
as
he
was
to
creep
under
the
shelter
of
the
evening
post
and
the
nation
he
was
well
aware
that
he
should
find
there
only
the
same
circle
of
readers
that
he
reached
in
the
north
american
review
the
outlook
was
dim
but
it
was
all
he
had
and
at
washington
except
for
the
personal
friendship
of
evarts
who
was
then
attorney
general
and
living
there
he
would
stand
in
solitude
much
like
that
of
london
in
evarts
did
what
no
one
in
boston
seemed
to
care
for
doing
he
held
out
a
hand
to
the
young
man
whether
boston
like
salem
really
shunned
strangers
or
whether
evarts
was
an
exception
even
in
new
york
he
had
the
social
instinct
which
boston
had
not
generous
by
nature
prodigal
in
hospitality
fond
of
young
people
and
a
born
evarts
gave
and
took
liberally
without
scruple
and
accepted
the
world
without
fearing
or
abusing
it
his
wit
was
the
least
part
of
his
social
attraction
his
talk
was
broad
and
free
he
laughed
where
he
could
he
joked
if
a
joke
was
possible
he
was
true
to
his
friends
and
never
lost
his
temper
or
became
like
all
new
yorkers
he
was
decidedly
not
a
bostonian
but
he
was
what
one
might
call
a
transplanted
new
englander
like
general
sherman
a
variety
grown
in
ranker
soil
in
the
course
of
life
and
in
widely
different
countries
adams
incurred
heavy
debts
of
gratitude
to
persons
on
whom
he
had
no
claim
and
to
whom
he
could
seldom
make
return
perhaps
such
debts
remained
unpaid
at
last
although
six
is
a
large
number
as
lives
go
but
kindness
seldom
came
more
happily
than
when
evarts
took
him
to
washington
in
october
adams
accepted
the
hospitality
of
the
sleeper
with
deep
gratitude
the
more
because
his
first
struggle
with
a
made
him
doubt
the
value
to
him
of
a
pullman
civilization
but
he
was
even
more
grateful
for
the
shelter
of
evarts
house
in
h
street
at
the
corner
of
fourteenth
where
he
abode
in
safety
and
content
till
he
found
rooms
in
the
roomless
village
to
him
the
village
seemed
unchanged
had
he
not
known
that
a
great
war
and
eight
years
of
astonishing
movement
had
passed
over
it
he
would
have
noticed
nothing
that
betrayed
growth
as
of
old
houses
were
few
rooms
fewer
even
the
men
were
the
same
no
one
seemed
to
miss
the
usual
comforts
of
civilization
and
adams
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
for
his
best
chance
lay
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
first
step
of
course
was
the
making
of
acquaintance
and
the
first
acquaintance
was
naturally
the
president
to
whom
an
aspirant
to
the
press
officially
paid
respect
evarts
immediately
took
him
to
the
white
house
and
presented
him
to
president
andrew
johnson
the
interview
was
brief
and
consisted
in
the
stock
remark
common
to
monarchs
and
valets
that
the
young
man
looked
even
younger
than
he
was
the
younger
man
felt
even
younger
than
he
looked
he
never
saw
the
president
again
and
never
felt
a
wish
to
see
him
for
andrew
johnson
was
not
the
sort
of
man
whom
a
young
reformer
of
thirty
with
two
or
three
foreign
educations
was
likely
to
see
with
enthusiasm
yet
musing
over
the
interview
as
a
matter
of
education
long
years
afterwards
he
could
not
help
recalling
the
president
figure
with
a
distinctness
that
surprised
him
the
southern
senator
and
statesman
sat
in
his
chair
at
his
desk
with
a
look
of
that
had
its
value
none
doubted
all
were
great
men
some
no
doubt
were
greater
than
others
but
all
were
statesmen
and
all
were
supported
lifted
inspired
by
the
moral
certainty
of
rightness
to
them
the
universe
was
serious
even
solemn
but
it
was
their
universe
a
southern
conception
of
right
lamar
used
to
say
that
he
never
entertained
a
doubt
of
the
soundness
of
the
southern
system
until
he
found
that
slavery
could
not
stand
a
war
slavery
was
only
a
part
of
the
southern
system
and
the
life
of
it
all
the
vigor
the
poetry
was
its
moral
certainty
of
self
the
southerner
could
not
doubt
and
this
not
only
gave
andrew
johnson
the
look
of
a
true
president
but
actually
made
him
one
when
adams
came
to
look
back
on
it
afterwards
he
was
surprised
to
realize
how
strong
the
executive
was
in
perhaps
the
strongest
he
was
ever
to
see
certainly
he
never
again
found
himself
so
well
satisfied
or
so
much
at
home
seward
was
still
secretary
of
state
hardly
yet
an
old
man
though
showing
marks
of
time
and
violence
seward
seemed
little
changed
in
these
eight
years
he
was
the
same
with
a
difference
perhaps
he
unlike
henry
adams
had
at
last
got
an
education
and
all
he
wanted
perhaps
he
had
resigned
himself
to
doing
without
it
whatever
the
reason
although
his
manner
was
as
roughly
kind
as
ever
and
his
talk
as
free
he
appeared
to
have
closed
his
account
with
the
public
he
no
longer
seemed
to
care
he
asked
nothing
gave
nothing
and
invited
no
support
he
talked
little
of
himself
or
of
others
and
waited
only
for
his
discharge
adams
was
well
pleased
to
be
near
him
in
these
last
days
of
his
power
and
fame
and
went
much
to
his
house
in
the
evenings
when
he
was
sure
to
be
at
his
whist
at
last
as
the
end
drew
near
wanting
to
feel
that
the
great
man
the
only
chief
he
ever
served
even
as
a
volunteer
recognized
some
personal
relation
he
asked
seward
to
dine
with
him
one
evening
in
his
rooms
and
play
his
game
of
whist
there
as
he
did
every
night
in
his
own
house
seward
came
and
had
his
whist
and
adams
remembered
his
rough
parting
speech
a
very
sensible
entertainment
it
was
the
only
favor
he
ever
asked
of
seward
and
the
only
one
he
ever
accepted
thus
as
a
teacher
of
wisdom
after
twenty
years
of
example
governor
seward
passed
out
of
one
life
and
adams
lost
what
should
have
been
his
firmest
ally
but
in
truth
the
state
department
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
his
interest
and
the
treasury
had
taken
its
place
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
a
man
new
to
politics
hugh
mcculloch
not
a
person
of
much
importance
in
the
eyes
of
practical
politicians
such
as
young
members
of
the
press
meant
themselves
to
become
but
they
all
liked
mcculloch
though
they
thought
him
a
rather
than
a
force
had
they
known
what
sort
of
forces
the
treasury
was
to
offer
them
for
support
in
the
generation
to
come
they
might
have
reflected
a
long
while
on
their
estimate
of
mcculloch
adams
was
fated
to
watch
the
flittings
of
many
more
secretaries
than
he
ever
cared
to
know
and
he
rather
came
back
in
the
end
to
the
idea
that
mcculloch
was
the
best
of
them
although
he
seemed
to
represent
everything
that
one
liked
least
he
was
no
politician
he
had
no
party
and
no
power
he
was
not
fashionable
or
decorative
he
was
a
banker
and
towards
bankers
adams
felt
the
narrow
prejudice
which
the
serf
feels
to
his
overseer
for
he
knew
he
must
obey
and
he
knew
that
the
helpless
showed
only
their
helplessness
when
they
tempered
obedience
by
mockery
the
world
after
became
a
bankers
world
and
no
banker
would
ever
trust
one
who
had
deserted
state
street
and
had
gone
to
washington
with
purposes
of
doubtful
credit
or
of
no
credit
at
all
for
he
could
not
have
put
up
enough
collateral
to
borrow
five
thousand
dollars
of
any
bank
in
america
the
banker
never
would
trust
him
and
he
would
never
trust
the
banker
to
him
the
banking
mind
was
obnoxious
and
this
antipathy
caused
him
the
more
surprise
at
finding
mcculloch
the
broadest
most
liberal
most
genial
and
most
practical
public
man
in
washington
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
the
burden
of
the
treasury
at
that
time
was
very
great
the
whole
financial
system
was
in
chaos
every
part
of
it
required
reform
the
utmost
experience
tact
and
skill
could
not
make
the
machine
work
smoothly
no
one
knew
how
well
mcculloch
did
it
until
his
successor
took
it
in
charge
and
tried
to
correct
his
methods
adams
did
not
know
enough
to
appreciate
mcculloch
technical
skill
but
he
was
struck
at
his
open
and
generous
treatment
of
young
men
of
all
rare
qualities
this
was
in
experience
the
rarest
as
a
rule
officials
dread
interference
the
strongest
often
resent
it
most
any
official
who
admits
equality
in
discussion
of
his
official
course
feels
it
to
be
an
act
of
virtue
after
a
few
months
or
years
he
tires
of
the
effort
every
friend
in
power
is
a
friend
lost
this
rule
is
so
nearly
absolute
that
it
may
be
taken
in
practice
as
admitting
no
exception
apparent
exceptions
exist
and
mcculloch
was
one
of
them
mcculloch
had
been
spared
the
gluttonous
selfishness
and
infantile
jealousy
which
are
the
commoner
results
of
early
political
education
he
had
neither
past
nor
future
and
could
afford
to
be
careless
of
his
company
adams
found
him
surrounded
by
all
the
active
and
intelligent
young
men
in
the
country
full
of
faith
greedy
for
work
eager
for
reform
energetic
confident
capable
quick
of
study
charmed
with
a
fight
equally
ready
to
defend
or
attack
they
were
unselfish
and
even
as
young
men
went
honest
they
came
mostly
from
the
army
with
the
spirit
of
the
volunteers
frank
walker
frank
barlow
frank
bartlett
were
types
of
the
generation
most
of
the
press
and
much
of
the
public
especially
in
the
west
shared
their
ideas
no
one
denied
the
need
for
reform
the
whole
government
from
top
to
bottom
was
rotten
with
the
senility
of
what
was
antiquated
and
the
instability
of
what
was
improvised
the
currency
was
only
one
example
the
tariff
was
another
but
the
whole
fabric
required
reconstruction
as
much
as
in
for
the
constitution
had
become
as
antiquated
as
the
confederation
sooner
or
later
a
shock
must
come
the
more
dangerous
the
longer
postponed
the
civil
war
had
made
a
new
system
in
fact
the
country
would
have
to
reorganize
the
machinery
in
practice
and
theory
one
might
discuss
indefinitely
the
question
which
branch
of
government
needed
reform
most
urgently
all
needed
it
enough
but
no
one
denied
that
the
finances
were
a
scandal
and
a
constant
universal
nuisance
the
tariff
was
worse
though
more
interests
upheld
it
mcculloch
had
the
singular
merit
of
facing
reform
with
large
and
willing
sympathy
outside
of
parties
jobs
bargains
corporations
or
intrigues
which
adams
never
was
to
meet
again
chaos
often
breeds
life
when
order
breeds
habit
the
civil
war
had
bred
life
the
army
bred
courage
young
men
of
the
volunteer
type
were
not
always
docile
under
control
but
they
were
handy
in
a
fight
adams
was
greatly
pleased
to
be
admitted
as
one
of
them
he
found
himself
much
at
home
with
them
more
at
home
than
he
ever
had
been
before
or
was
ever
to
be
again
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
treasury
he
had
no
strong
party
passion
and
he
felt
as
though
he
and
his
friends
owned
this
administration
which
in
its
dying
days
had
neither
friends
nor
future
except
in
them
these
were
not
the
only
allies
the
whole
government
in
all
its
branches
was
alive
with
them
just
at
that
moment
the
supreme
court
was
about
to
take
up
the
legal
tender
cases
where
judge
curtis
had
been
employed
to
argue
against
the
constitutional
power
of
the
government
to
make
an
artificial
standard
of
value
in
time
of
peace
evarts
was
anxious
to
fix
on
a
line
of
argument
that
should
have
a
chance
of
standing
up
against
that
of
judge
curtis
and
was
puzzled
to
do
it
he
did
not
know
which
foot
to
put
forward
about
to
deal
with
judge
curtis
the
last
of
the
strong
jurists
of
marshall
school
he
could
risk
no
chances
in
doubt
the
quickest
way
to
clear
one
mind
is
to
discuss
and
evarts
deliberately
forced
discussion
day
after
day
driving
dining
walking
he
provoked
adams
to
dispute
his
positions
he
needed
an
anvil
he
said
to
hammer
his
ideas
on
adams
was
flattered
at
being
an
anvil
which
is
after
all
more
solid
than
the
hammer
and
he
did
not
feel
called
on
to
treat
evarts
arguments
with
more
respect
than
evarts
himself
expressed
for
them
so
he
contradicted
with
freedom
like
most
young
men
he
was
much
of
a
doctrinaire
and
the
question
was
in
any
event
rather
historical
or
political
than
legal
he
could
easily
maintain
by
way
of
argument
that
the
required
power
had
never
been
given
and
that
no
sound
constitutional
reason
could
possibly
exist
for
authorizing
the
government
to
overthrow
the
standard
of
value
without
necessity
in
time
of
peace
the
dispute
itself
had
not
much
value
for
him
even
as
education
but
it
led
to
his
seeking
light
from
the
chief
justice
himself
following
up
the
subject
for
his
letters
to
the
nation
and
his
articles
in
the
north
american
review
adams
grew
to
be
intimate
with
the
chief
justice
who
as
one
of
the
oldest
and
strongest
leaders
of
the
free
soil
party
had
claims
to
his
personal
regard
for
the
old
free
soilers
were
becoming
few
like
all
and
men
chase
had
the
faults
of
his
qualities
he
was
never
easy
to
drive
in
harness
or
light
in
hand
he
saw
vividly
what
was
wrong
and
did
not
always
allow
for
what
was
relatively
right
he
loved
power
as
though
he
were
still
a
senator
his
position
towards
legal
tender
was
awkward
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
had
been
its
author
as
chief
justice
he
became
its
enemy
legal
tender
caused
no
great
pleasure
or
pain
in
the
sum
of
life
to
a
newspaper
correspondent
but
it
served
as
a
subject
for
letters
and
the
chief
justice
was
very
willing
to
win
an
ally
in
the
press
who
would
tell
his
story
as
he
wished
it
to
be
read
the
intimacy
in
chase
house
grew
rapidly
and
the
alliance
was
no
small
help
to
the
comforts
of
a
struggling
newspaper
adventurer
in
washington
no
matter
what
one
might
think
of
his
politics
or
temper
chase
was
a
dramatic
figure
of
high
senatorial
rank
if
also
of
certain
senatorial
faults
a
valuable
ally
as
was
sure
sooner
or
later
to
happen
adams
one
day
met
charles
sumner
on
the
street
and
instantly
stopped
to
greet
him
as
though
eight
years
of
broken
ties
were
the
natural
course
of
friendship
sumner
at
once
after
an
exclamation
of
surprise
dropped
back
into
the
relation
of
hero
to
the
school
boy
adams
enjoyed
accepting
it
he
was
then
thirty
years
old
and
sumner
was
he
had
seen
more
of
the
world
than
sumner
ever
dreamed
of
and
he
felt
a
sort
of
amused
curiosity
to
be
treated
once
more
as
a
child
at
best
the
renewal
of
broken
relations
is
a
nervous
matter
and
in
this
case
it
bristled
with
thorns
for
sumner
quarrel
with
adams
had
not
been
the
most
delicate
of
his
ruptured
relations
and
he
was
liable
to
be
sensitive
in
many
ways
that
even
bostonians
could
hardly
keep
in
constant
mind
yet
it
interested
and
fascinated
henry
adams
as
a
new
study
of
political
humanity
the
younger
man
knew
that
the
meeting
would
have
to
come
and
was
ready
for
it
if
only
as
a
newspaper
need
but
to
sumner
it
came
as
a
surprise
and
a
disagreeable
one
as
adams
conceived
he
learned
something
a
piece
of
practical
education
worth
the
effort
by
watching
sumner
behavior
he
could
see
that
many
thoughts
mostly
unpleasant
were
passing
through
his
mind
since
he
made
no
inquiry
about
any
of
adams
family
or
allusion
to
any
of
his
friends
or
his
residence
abroad
he
talked
only
of
the
present
to
him
adams
in
washington
should
have
seemed
more
or
less
of
a
critic
perhaps
a
spy
certainly
an
intriguer
or
adventurer
like
scores
of
others
a
politician
without
party
a
writer
without
principles
an
certain
to
beg
for
support
all
this
was
for
his
purposes
true
adams
could
do
him
no
good
and
would
be
likely
to
do
him
all
the
harm
in
his
power
adams
accepted
it
all
expected
to
be
kept
at
arm
length
admitted
that
the
reasons
were
just
he
was
the
more
surprised
to
see
that
sumner
invited
a
renewal
of
old
relations
he
found
himself
treated
almost
confidentially
not
only
was
he
asked
to
make
a
fourth
at
sumner
pleasant
little
dinners
in
the
house
on
la
fayette
square
but
he
found
himself
admitted
to
the
senator
study
and
informed
of
his
views
policy
and
purposes
which
were
sometimes
even
more
astounding
than
his
curious
gaps
or
lapses
of
omniscience
on
the
whole
the
relation
was
the
queerest
that
henry
adams
ever
kept
up
he
liked
and
admired
sumner
but
thought
his
mind
a
pathological
study
at
times
he
inclined
to
think
that
sumner
felt
his
solitude
and
in
the
political
wilderness
craved
educated
society
but
this
hardly
told
the
whole
story
sumner
mind
had
reached
the
calm
of
water
which
receives
and
reflects
images
without
absorbing
them
it
contained
nothing
but
itself
the
images
from
without
the
objects
mechanically
perceived
by
the
senses
existed
by
courtesy
until
the
mental
surface
was
ruffled
but
never
became
part
of
the
thought
henry
adams
roused
no
emotion
if
he
had
roused
a
disagreeable
one
he
would
have
ceased
to
exist
the
mind
would
have
mechanically
rejected
as
it
had
mechanically
admitted
him
not
that
sumner
was
more
aggressively
egoistic
than
other
senators
conkling
for
instance
but
that
with
him
the
disease
had
affected
the
whole
mind
it
was
chronic
and
absolute
while
with
other
senators
for
the
most
part
it
was
still
acute
perhaps
for
this
very
reason
sumner
was
the
more
valuable
acquaintance
for
a
adams
found
him
most
useful
perhaps
quite
the
most
useful
of
all
these
great
authorities
who
were
the
of
the
newspaper
business
the
accumulated
capital
of
a
silurian
age
a
few
months
or
years
more
and
they
were
gone
in
they
were
like
the
town
itself
changing
but
not
changed
la

few
hundred

yet
discovered
the

no
literary

scientific
man
no
artist
no
gentleman
without
office
or
employment
had
ever
lived
there
it
was
rural
and
its
society
was
primitive
scarcely
a
person
in
it
had
ever
known
life
in
a
great
city
evarts
sam
hooper
of
boston
and
perhaps
one
or
two
of
the
diplomatists
had
alone
mixed
in
that
sort
of
world
the
happy
village
was
innocent
of
a
club
the
tram
on
f
street
to
the
capitol

ample
for
traffic
every
pleasant
spring
morning
at
the
pennsylvania
station

met
to
bid

its
friends

off

state
department
was
lodged
in
an
infant
asylum
far
out
on
fourteenth
street
while
mullett
was
constructing
his
architectural
infant
asylum
next
the
white
house
the
value
of
real
estate
had
not
increased
since
and
the
pavements
were
more
impassable
than
the
mud
all
this
favored
a
young
man
who
had
come
to
make
a
name
in
hours
he
could
know
everybody
in
two
days
everybody
knew
him
after
seven
years
arduous
and
unsuccessful
effort
to
explore
the
outskirts
of
london
society
the
washington
world
offered
an
easy
and
delightful
repose
when
he
looked
round
him
from
the
safe
shelter
of
evarts
roof
on
the
men
he
was
to
work
with
or
against
he
had
to
admit
that
of
his
acquired
education
was
useless
and
the
other
tenth
harmful
he
would
have
to
begin
again
from
the
beginning
he
must
learn
to
talk
to
the
western
congressman
and
to
hide
his
own
antecedents
the
task
was
amusing
he
could
see
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
enjoying
it
with
immoral
unconcern
for
all
that
had
gone
before
and
for
anything
that
might
follow

lobby

a
spectacle

picturesque

what

it

with
an
open
hand
for
the
moment
politics
had
ceased
to
disturb
social
relations
all
parties
were
mixed
up
and
jumbled
together
in
a
sort
of
tidal
the
government
resembled
adams
himself
in
the
matter
of
education
all
that
had
gone
before
was
useless
and
some
of
it
was
worse

the
first
effect
of
this
leap
into
the
unknown
was
a
fit
of
low
spirits
new
to
the
young
man
education
due
in
part
to
the
overpowering
beauty
and
sweetness
of
the
maryland
autumn
almost
unendurable
for
its
strain
on
one
who
had
toned
his
life
down
to
the
november
grays
and
browns
of
northern
europe
life
could
not
go
on
so
beautiful
and
so
sad
luckily
no
one
else
felt
it
or
knew
it
he
bore
it
as
well
as
he
could
and
when
he
picked
himself
up
winter
had
come
and
he
was
settled
in
bachelor
quarters
as
modest
as
those
of
a
clerk
in
the
departments
far
out
on
g
street
towards
georgetown
where
an
old
finn
named
dohna
who
had
come
out
with
the
russian
minister
stoeckel
long
before
had
bought
or
built
a

house
congress
had
met
two
or
three
months
remained
to
the
old
administration
but
all
interest
centred
in
the
new
one
the
town
began
to
swarm
with
among
whom
a
young
writer
was
lost
he
drifted
among
them
unnoticed
glad
to
learn
his
work
under
cover
of
the
confusion
he
never
aspired
to
become
a
regular
reporter
he
knew
he
should
fail
in
trying
a
career
so
ambitious
and
energetic
but
he
picked
up
friends
on
the
press

all
reformers
and
all
mixed
and
jumbled
together
in
a
tidal
wave
of
expectation
waiting
for
general
grant
to
give
orders
no
one
seemed
to
know
much
about
it
even
senators
had
nothing
to
say
one
could
only
make
notes
and
study
finance
in
waiting
he
amused
himself
as
he
could
in
the
amusements
of
washington
education
had
no
part
but
the
simplicity
of
the
amusements
proved
the
simplicity
of
everything
else
ambitions
interests
thoughts
and
knowledge
proverbially
washington
was
a
poor
place
for
education
and
of
course
young
diplomats
avoided
or
disliked
it
but
as
a
rule
diplomats
disliked
every
place
except
paris
and
the
world
contained
only
one
paris
they
abused
london
more
violently
than
washington
they
praised
no
post
under
the
sun
and
they
were
merely
describing
of
their
stations
when
they
complained
that
there
were
no
theatres
no
restaurants
no
monde
no
no
drives
no
splendor
and
as
mme
de
struve
used
to
say
no
grandezza
this
was
all
true
washington
was
a
mere
political
camp
as
transient
and
temporary
as
a
for
religious
revival
but
the
diplomats
had
least
reason
to
complain
since
they
were
more
sought
for
there
than
they
would
ever
be
elsewhere
for
young
men
washington
was
in
one
way
paradise
since
they
were
few
and
greatly
in
demand
after
watching
the
abject
unimportance
of
the
young
diplomat
in
london
society
adams
found
himself
a
young
duke
in
washington
he
had
ten
years
of
youth
to
make
up
and
a
ravenous
appetite
washington
was
the
easiest
society
he
had
ever
seen
and
even
the
bostonian
became
simple
almost
genial
in
the
softness
of
a
washington
spring
society
went
on
excellently
well
without
houses
or
carriages
or
jewels
or
toilettes
or
pavements
or
shops
or
grandezza
of
any
sort
and
the
market
was
excellent
as
well
as
cheap
one
could
not
stay
there
a
month
without
loving
the
shabby
town
even
the
washington
girl
who
was
neither
rich
nor
nor
nor
clever
had
singular
charm
and
used
it
according
to
adams
the
father
this
charm
dated
back
as
far
as
monroe
administration
to
his
personal
knowledge
therefore
behind
all
the
processes
of
political
or
financial
or
newspaper
training
the
social
side
of
washington
was
to
be
taken
for
granted
as
of
existence
its
details
matter
nothing
life
ceased
to
be
strenuous
and
the
victim
thanked
god
for
it
politics
and
reform
became
the
detail
and
waltzing
the
profession
adams
was
not
alone
senator
sumner
had
as
private
secretary
a
young
man
named
moorfield
storey
who
became
a
dangerous
example
of
frivolity
the
new
hoar
brought
with
him
from
concord
a
son
sam
hoar
whose
example
rivalled
that
of
storey
another
impenitent
was
named
dewey
a
young
naval
officer
adams
came
far
down
in
the
list
he
wished
he
had
been
higher
he
could
have
spared
a
world
of
superannuated
history
science
or
politics
to
have
reversed
better
in
waltzing
he
had
no
adequate
notion
how
little
he
knew
especially
of
women
and
washington
offered
no
standard
of
comparison
all
were
profoundly
ignorant
together
and
as
indifferent
as
children
to
education
no
one
needed
knowledge
washington
was
happier
without
style
certainly
adams
was
happier
without
it
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
before
happier
than
any
one
in
the
harsh
world
of
strenuousness
could
dream
of
this
must
be
taken
as
background
for
such
little
education
as
he
gained
but
the
life
belonged
to
the
eighteenth
century
and
in
no
way
concerned
education
for
the
twentieth
in
such
an
atmosphere
one
made
no
great
pretence
of
hard
work
if
the
world
wants
hard
work
the
world
must
pay
for
it
and
if
it
will
not
pay
it
has
no
fault
to
find
with
the
worker
thus
far
no
one
had
made
a
suggestion
of
pay
for
any
work
that
adams
had
done
or
could
do
if
he
worked
at
all
it
was
for
social
consideration
and
social
pleasure
was
his
pay
for
this
he
was
willing
to
go
on
working
as
an
artist
goes
on
painting
when
no
one
buys
his
pictures
artists
have
done
it
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
will
do
it
after
time
has
expired
since
they
can
not
help
themselves
and
they
find
their
return
in
the
pride
of
their
social
superiority
as
they
feel
it
society
commonly
abets
them
and
encourages
their
attitude
of
contempt
the
society
of
washington
was
too
simple
and
southern
as
yet
to
feel
anarchistic
longings
and
it
never
read
or
saw
what
artists
produced
elsewhere
but
it
abetted
them
when
it
had
the
chance
and
respected
itself
the
more
for
the
frailty
adams
found
even
the
government
at
his
service
and
every
one
willing
to
answer
his
questions
he
worked
after
a
fashion
not
very
hard
but
as
much
as
the
government
would
have
required
of
him
for
nine
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
his
work
defied
frivolity
he
got
more
pleasure
from
writing
than
the
world
ever
got
from
reading
him
for
his
work
was
not
amusing
nor
was
he
one
must
not
try
to
amuse
moneylenders
or
investors
and
this
was
the
class
to
which
he
began
by
appealing
he
gave
three
months
to
an
article
on
the
finances
of
the
united
states
just
then
a
subject
greatly
needing
treatment
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
sent
it
to
london
to
his
friend
henry
reeve
the
ponderous
editor
of
the
edinburgh
review
reeve
probably
thought
it
good
at
all
events
he
said
so
and
he
printed
it
in
april
of
course
it
was
reprinted
in
america
but
in
england
such
articles
were
still
anonymous
and
the
author
remained
unknown
the
author
was
not
then
asking
for
advertisement
and
made
no
claim
for
credit
his
object
was
literary
he
wanted
to
win
a
place
on
the
staff
of
the
edinburgh
review
under
the
vast
shadow
of
lord
macaulay
and
to
a
young
american
in
such
rank
seemed
colossal
the
highest
in
the
literary
world
as
it
had
been
only
years
before
time
and
tide
had
flowed
since
then
but
the
position
still
flattered
vanity
though
it
brought
no
other
flattery
or
reward
except
the
regular
thirty
pounds
of
pay
fifty
dollars
a
month
measured
in
time
and
labor
the
edinburgh
article
finished
he
set
himself
to
work
on
a
scheme
for
the
north
american
review
in
england
lord
robert
cecil
had
invented
for
the
london
quarterly
an
annual
review
of
politics
which
he
called
the
session
adams
stole
the
idea
and
the
name
he
thought
he
had
been
enough
in
lord
robert
house
in
days
of
his
struggle
with
adversity
to
excuse
the
theft
and
began
what
he
meant
for
a
permanent
series
of
annual
political
reviews
which
he
hoped
to
make
in
time
a
political
authority
with
his
sources
of
information
and
his
social
intimacies
at
washington
he
could
not
help
saying
something
that
would
command
attention
he
had
the
field
to
himself
and
he
meant
to
give
himself
a
free
hand
as
he
went
on
whether
the
newspapers
liked
it
or
not
they
would
have
to
reckon
with
him
for
such
a
power
once
established
was
more
effective
than
all
the
speeches
in
congress
or
reports
to
the
president
that
could
be
crammed
into
the
government
presses
the
first
of
these
sessions
appeared
in
april
but
it
could
not
be
condensed
into
a
single
article
and
had
to
be
supplemented
in
october
by
another
which
bore
the
title
of
civil
service
reform
and
was
really
a
part
of
the
same
review
a
good
deal
of
authentic
history
slipped
into
these
papers
whether
any
one
except
his
press
associates
ever
read
them
he
never
knew
and
never
greatly
cared
the
difference
is
slight
to
the
influence
of
an
author
whether
he
is
read
by
five
hundred
readers
or
by
five
hundred
thousand
if
he
can
select
the
five
hundred
he
reaches
the
five
hundred
thousand
the
fateful
year
was
near
at
hand
which
was
to
mark
the
close
of
the
literary
epoch
when
quarterlies
gave
way
to
monthlies
to
illustration
volumes
to
pages
the
outburst
was
brilliant
bret
harte
led
and
robert
louis
stevenson
followed
guy
de
maupassant
and
rudyard
kipling
brought
up
the
rear
and
dazzled
the
world
as
usual
adams
found
himself
fifty
years
behind
his
time
but
a
number
of
belated
wanderers
kept
him
company
and
they
produced
on
each
other
the
effect
or
illusion
of
a
public
opinion
they
straggled
apart
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
through
the
procession
but
they
were
still
within
hearing
distance
of
each
other
the
drift
was
still
superficially
conservative
just
as
the
church
spoke
with
apparent
authority
or
the
quarterlies
laid
down
an
apparent
law
and
no
one
could
surely
say
where
the
real
authority
or
the
real
law
lay
science
did
not
know
truths
a
priori
held
their
own
against
truths
surely
relative
according
to
lowell
right
was
forever
on
the
scaffold
wrong
was
forever
on
the
throne
and
most
people
still
thought
they
believed
it
adams
was
not
the
only
relic
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
he
could
still
depend
on
a
certain
number
of
listeners
mostly
respectable
and
some
rich
want
of
audience
did
not
trouble
him
he
was
well
enough
off
in
that
respect
and
would
have
succeeded
in
all
his
calculations
if
this
had
been
his
only
hazard
where
he
broke
down
was
at
a
point
where
he
always
suffered
wreck
and
where
nine
adventurers
out
of
ten
make
their
errors
one
may
be
more
or
less
certain
of
organized
forces
one
can
never
be
certain
of
men
he
belonged
to
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
eighteenth
century
upset
all
his
plans
for
the
moment
america
was
more
eighteenth
century
than
himself
it
reverted
to
the
stone
age
as
education
of
a
certain
sort
the
story
had
probably
a
certain
value
though
he
could
never
see
it
one
seldom
can
see
much
education
in
the
buck
of
a
broncho
even
less
in
the
kick
of
a
mule
the
lesson
it
teaches
is
only
that
of
getting
out
of
the
animal
way
this
was
the
lesson
that
henry
adams
had
learned
over
and
over
again
in
politics
since
at
least
of
the
american
people
adams
among
the
rest
had
united
in
the
election
of
general
grant
to
the
presidency
and
probably
had
been
more
or
less
affected
in
their
choice
by
the
parallel
they
felt
between
grant
and
washington
nothing
could
be
more
obvious
grant
represented
order
he
was
a
great
soldier
and
the
soldier
always
represented
order
he
might
be
as
partisan
as
he
pleased
but
a
general
who
had
organized
and
commanded
half
a
million
or
a
million
men
in
the
field
must
know
how
to
administer
even
washington
who
was
in
education
and
experience
a
mere
had
known
how
to
organize
a
government
and
had
found
jeffersons
and
hamiltons
to
organize
his
departments
the
task
of
bringing
the
government
back
to
regular
practices
and
of
restoring
moral
and
mechanical
order
to
administration
was
not
very
difficult
it
was
ready
to
do
it
itself
with
a
little
encouragement
no
doubt
the
confusion
especially
in
the
old
slave
states
and
in
the
currency
was
considerable
but
the
general
disposition
was
good
and
every
one
had
echoed
that
famous
phrase
let
us
have
peace
adams
was
young
and
easily
deceived
in
spite
of
his
diplomatic
adventures
but
even
at
twice
his
age
he
could
not
see
that
this
reliance
on
grant
was
unreasonable
had
grant
been
a
congressman
one
would
have
been
on
one
guard
for
one
knew
the
type
one
never
expected
from
a
congressman
more
than
good
intentions
and
public
spirit
as
a
rule
had
no
great
respect
for
the
lower
house
senators
had
less
and
cabinet
officers
had
none
at
all
indeed
one
day
when
adams
was
pleading
with
a
cabinet
officer
for
patience
and
tact
in
dealing
with
representatives
the
secretary
impatiently
broke
out
you
ca
use
tact
with
a
congressman
a
congressman
is
a
hog
you
must
take
a
stick
and
hit
him
on
the
snout
adams
knew
far
too
little
compared
with
the
secretary
to
contradict
him
though
he
thought
the
phrase
somewhat
harsh
even
as
applied
to
the
average
congressman
of
he
saw
little
or
nothing
of
later
ones
but
he
knew
a
shorter
way
of
silencing
criticism
he
had
but
to
ask
if
a
congressman
is
a
hog
what
is
a
senator
this
innocent
question
put
in
a
candid
spirit
petrified
any
executive
officer
that
ever
sat
a
week
in
his
office
even
adams
admitted
that
senators
passed
belief
the
comic
side
of
their
egotism
partly
disguised
its
extravagance
but
faction
had
gone
so
far
under
andrew
johnson
that
at
times
the
whole
senate
seemed
to
catch
hysterics
of
nervous
bucking
without
apparent
reason
great
leaders
like
sumner
and
conkling
could
not
be
burlesqued
they
were
more
grotesque
than
ridicule
could
make
them
even
grant
who
rarely
sparkled
in
epigram
became
witty
on
their
account
but
their
egotism
and
factiousness
were
no
laughing
matter
they
did
permanent
and
terrible
mischief
as
garfield
and
blaine
and
even
mckinley
and
john
hay
were
to
feel
the
most
troublesome
task
of
a
reform
president
was
that
of
bringing
the
senate
back
to
decency
therefore
no
one
and
henry
adams
less
than
most
felt
hope
that
any
president
chosen
from
the
ranks
of
politics
or
politicians
would
raise
the
character
of
government
and
by
instinct
if
not
by
reason
all
the
world
united
on
grant
the
senate
understood
what
the
world
expected
and
waited
in
silence
for
a
struggle
with
grant
more
serious
than
that
with
andrew
johnson
were
alive
with
eagerness
to
support
the
president
against
the
senate
the
is
more
than
most
men
a
double
personality
and
his
person
feels
best
satisfied
in
its
double
instincts
when
writing
in
one
sense
and
thinking
in
another
all
whatever
they
wrote
felt
alike
about
the
senate
adams
floated
with
the
stream
he
was
eager
to
join
in
the
fight
which
he
foresaw
as
sooner
or
later
inevitable
he
meant
to
support
the
executive
in
attacking
the
senate
and
taking
away
its
vote
and
power
of
confirmation
nor
did
he
much
care
how
it
should
be
done
for
he
thought
it
safer
to
effect
the
revolution
in
than
to
wait
till
with
this
thought
in
his
mind
he
went
to
the
capitol
to
hear
the
names
announced
which
should
reveal
the
carefully
guarded
secret
of
grant
cabinet
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
wondered
at
the
suddenness
of
the
revolution
which
actually
within
five
minutes
changed
his
intended
future
into
an
absurdity
so
laughable
as
to
make
him
ashamed
of
it
he
was
to
hear
a
long
list
of
cabinet
announcements
not
much
weaker
or
more
futile
than
that
of
grant
and
none
of
them
made
him
blush
while
grant
nominations
had
the
singular
effect
of
making
the
hearer
ashamed
not
so
much
of
grant
as
of
himself
he
had
made
another
total
misconception
of
life
another
inconceivable
false
start
yet
unlikely
as
it
seemed
he
had
missed
his
motive
narrowly
and
his
intention
had
been
more
than
sound
for
the
senators
made
no
secret
of
saying
with
senatorial
frankness
that
grant
nominations
betrayed
his
intent
as
plainly
as
they
betrayed
his
incompetence
a
great
soldier
might
be
a
baby
politician
adams
left
the
capitol
much
in
the
same
misty
mental
condition
that
he
recalled
as
marking
his
railway
journey
to
london
on
may
he
felt
in
himself
what
gladstone
bewailed
so
sadly
the
incapacity
of
viewing
things
all
round
he
knew
without
absolutely
saying
it
that
grant
had
cut
short
the
life
which
adams
had
laid
out
for
himself
in
the
future
after
such
a
miscarriage
no
thought
of
effectual
reform
could
revive
for
at
least
one
generation
and
he
had
no
fancy
for
ineffectual
politics
what
course
could
he
sail
next
he
had
tried
so
many
and
society
had
barred
them
all
for
the
moment
he
saw
no
hope
but
in
following
the
stream
on
which
he
had
launched
himself
the
new
cabinet
as
individuals
were
not
hostile
subsequently
grant
made
changes
in
the
list
which
were
mostly
welcome
to
a
bostonian
or
should
have
been
although
fatal
to
adams
the
name
of
hamilton
fish
as
secretary
of
state
suggested
extreme
conservatism
and
probable
deference
to
sumner
the
name
of
george
boutwell
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
suggested
only
a
somewhat
lugubrious
joke
boutwell
could
be
described
only
as
the
opposite
of
mcculloch
and
meant
inertia
or
in
plain
words
total
extinction
for
any
one
resembling
henry
adams
on
the
other
hand
the
name
of
jacob
cox
as
secretary
of
the
interior
suggested
help
and
comfort
while
that
of
judge
hoar
as
promised
friendship
on
the
whole
the
personal
outlook
merely
for
literary
purposes
seemed
fairly
cheerful
and
the
political
outlook
though
hazy
still
depended
on
grant
himself
no
one
doubted
that
grant
intention
had
been
one
of
reform
that
his
aim
had
been
to
place
his
administration
above
politics
and
until
he
should
actually
drive
his
supporters
away
one
might
hope
to
support
him
one
little
lantern
must
therefore
be
turned
on
grant
one
seemed
to
know
him
so
well
and
really
knew
so
little
by
chance
it
happened
that
adam
badeau
took
the
lower
suite
of
rooms
at
dohna
and
as
it
was
convenient
to
have
one
table
the
two
men
dined
together
and
became
intimate
badeau
was
exceedingly
social
though
not
in
appearance
imposing
he
was
stout
his
face
was
red
and
his
habits
were
regularly
irregular
but
he
was
very
intelligent
a
good
and
an
excellent
military
historian
his
life
of
grant
was
no
ordinary
book
unlike
most
he
was
a
friendly
critic
of
grant
as
suited
an
officer
who
had
been
on
the
general
staff
as
a
rule
the
newspaper
correspondents
in
washington
were
unfriendly
and
the
lobby
sceptical
from
that
side
one
heard
tales
that
made
one
hair
stand
on
end
and
the
old
west
point
army
officers
were
no
more
flattering
all
described
him
as
vicious
narrow
dull
and
vindictive
badeau
who
had
come
to
washington
for
a
consulate
which
was
slow
to
reach
him
resorted
more
or
less
to
whiskey
for
encouragement
and
became
irritable
besides
being
loquacious
he
talked
much
about
grant
and
showed
a
certain
artistic
feeling
for
analysis
of
character
as
a
true
literary
critic
would
naturally
do
loyal
to
grant
and
still
more
so
to
grant
who
acted
as
his
patroness
he
said
nothing
even
when
far
gone
that
was
offensive
about
either
but
he
held
that
no
one
except
himself
and
rawlins
understood
the
general
to
him
grant
appeared
as
an
intermittent
energy
immensely
powerful
when
awake
but
passive
and
plastic
in
repose
he
said
that
neither
he
nor
the
rest
of
the
staff
knew
why
grant
succeeded
they
believed
in
him
because
of
his
success
for
stretches
of
time
his
mind
seemed
torpid
rawlins
and
the
others
would
systematically
talk
their
ideas
into
it
for
weeks
not
directly
but
by
discussion
among
themselves
in
his
presence
in
the
end
he
would
announce
the
idea
as
his
own
without
seeming
conscious
of
the
discussion
and
would
give
the
orders
to
carry
it
out
with
all
the
energy
that
belonged
to
his
nature
they
could
never
measure
his
character
or
be
sure
when
he
would
act
they
could
never
follow
a
mental
process
in
his
thought
they
were
not
sure
that
he
did
think
in
all
this
adams
took
deep
interest
for
although
he
was
not
like
badeau
waiting
for
grant
power
of
suggestion
to
act
on
the
general
mind
in
order
to
germinate
in
a
consulate
or
a
legation
his
portrait
gallery
of
great
men
was
becoming
large
and
it
amused
him
to
add
an
authentic
likeness
of
the
greatest
general
the
world
had
seen
since
napoleon
badeau
analysis
was
rather
delicate
infinitely
superior
to
that
of
sam
ward
or
charles
nordhoff
badeau
took
adams
to
the
white
house
one
evening
and
introduced
him
to
the
president
and
grant
first
and
last
he
saw
a
dozen
presidents
at
the
white
house
and
the
most
famous
were
by
no
means
the
most
agreeable
but
he
found
grant
the
most
curious
object
of
study
among
them
all
about
no
one
did
opinions
differ
so
widely
adams
had
no
opinion
or
occasion
to
make
one
a
single
word
with
grant
satisfied
him
that
for
his
own
good
the
fewer
words
he
risked
the
better
thus
far
in
life
he
had
met
with
but
one
man
of
the
same
intellectual
or
unintellectual
type
garibaldi
of
the
two
garibaldi
seemed
to
him
a
trifle
the
more
intellectual
but
in
both
the
intellect
counted
for
nothing
only
the
energy
counted
the
type
was
archaic
and
would
have
seemed
so
even
to
the
adam
according
to
legend
was
such
a
man
in
time
one
came
to
recognize
the
type
in
other
men
with
differences
and
variations
as
normal
men
whose
energies
were
the
greater
the
less
they
wasted
on
thought
men
who
sprang
from
the
soil
to
power
apt
to
be
distrustful
of
themselves
and
of
others
shy
jealous
sometimes
vindictive
more
or
less
dull
in
outward
appearance
always
needing
stimulants
but
for
whom
action
was
the
highest
stimulant
the
instinct
of
fight
such
men
were
forces
of
nature
energies
of
the
prime
like
the
pteraspis
but
they
made
short
work
of
scholars
they
had
commanded
thousands
of
such
and
saw
no
more
in
them
than
in
others
the
fact
was
certain
it
crushed
argument
and
intellect
at
once
adams
did
not
feel
grant
as
a
hostile
force
like
badeau
he
saw
only
an
uncertain
one
when
in
action
he
was
superb
and
safe
to
follow
only
when
torpid
he
was
dangerous
to
deal
with
him
one
must
stand
near
like
rawlins
and
practice
more
or
less
sympathetic
habits
beyond
the
experience
of
wall
street
or
state
street
he
resorted
like
most
men
of
the
same
intellectual
calibre
to
commonplaces
when
at
a
loss
for
expression
let
us
have
peace
or
the
best
way
to
treat
a
bad
law
is
to
execute
it
or
a
score
of
such
reversible
sentences
generally
to
be
gauged
by
their
sententiousness
but
sometimes
he
made
one
doubt
his
good
faith
as
when
he
seriously
remarked
to
a
particularly
bright
young
woman
that
venice
would
be
a
fine
city
if
it
were
drained
in
mark
twain
this
suggestion
would
have
taken
rank
among
his
best
witticisms
in
grant
it
was
a
measure
of
simplicity
not
singular
robert
lee
betrayed
the
same
intellectual
commonplace
in
a
virginian
form
not
to
the
same
degree
but
quite
distinctly
enough
for
one
who
knew
the
american
what
worried
adams
was
not
the
commonplace
it
was
as
usual
his
own
education
grant
fretted
and
irritated
him
like
the
terebratula
as
a
defiance
of
first
principles
he
had
no
right
to
exist
he
should
have
been
extinct
for
ages
the
idea
that
as
society
grew
older
it
grew
upset
evolution
and
made
of
education
a
fraud
that
two
thousand
years
after
alexander
the
great
and
julius
caesar
a
man
like
grant
should
be
called
and
should
actually
and
truly
be
the
highest
product
of
the
most
advanced
evolution
made
evolution
ludicrous
one
must
be
as
commonplace
as
grant
own
commonplaces
to
maintain
such
an
absurdity
the
progress
of
evolution
from
president
washington
to
president
grant
was
alone
evidence
enough
to
upset
darwin
education
became
more
perplexing
at
every
phase
no
theory
was
worth
the
pen
that
wrote
it
america
had
no
use
for
adams
because
he
was
and
yet
it
worshipped
grant
because
he
was
archaic
and
should
have
lived
in
a
cave
and
worn
skins
darwinists
ought
to
conclude
that
america
was
reverting
to
the
stone
age
but
the
theory
of
reversion
was
more
absurd
than
that
of
evolution
administration
reverted
to
nothing
one
could
not
catch
a
trait
of
the
past
still
less
of
the
future
it
was
not
even
sensibly
american
not
an
official
in
it
except
perhaps
rawlins
whom
adams
never
met
and
who
died
in
september
suggested
an
american
idea
yet
this
administration
which
upset
adams
whole
life
was
not
unfriendly
it
was
made
up
largely
of
friends
secretary
fish
was
almost
kind
he
kept
the
tradition
of
new
york
social
values
he
was
human
and
took
no
pleasure
in
giving
pain
adams
felt
no
prejudice
whatever
in
his
favor
and
he
had
nothing
in
mind
or
person
to
attract
regard
his
social
gifts
were
not
remarkable
he
was
not
in
the
least
magnetic
he
was
far
from
young
but
he
won
confidence
from
the
start
and
remained
a
friend
to
the
finish
as
far
as
concerned
mr
fish
one
felt
rather
happily
suited
and
one
was
still
better
off
in
the
interior
department
with
cox
indeed
if
cox
had
been
in
the
treasury
and
boutwell
in
the
interior
one
would
have
been
quite
satisfied
as
far
as
personal
relations
went
while
in
the
office
judge
hoar
seemed
to
fill
every
possible
ideal
both
personal
and
political
the
difficulty
was
not
the
want
of
friends
and
had
the
whole
government
been
filled
with
them
it
would
have
helped
little
without
the
president
and
the
treasury
grant
avowed
from
the
start
a
policy
of
drift
and
a
policy
of
drift
attaches
only
barnacles
at
thirty
one
has
no
interest
in
becoming
a
barnacle
but
even
in
that
character
henry
adams
would
have
been
his
friends
were
reformers
critics
doubtful
in
party
allegiance
and
he
was
himself
an
object
of
suspicion
grant
had
no
objects
wanted
no
help
wished
for
no
champions
the
executive
asked
only
to
be
let
alone
this
was
his
meaning
when
he
said
let
us
have
peace
no
one
wanted
to
go
into
opposition
as
for
adams
all
his
hopes
of
success
in
life
turned
on
his
finding
an
administration
to
support
he
knew
well
enough
the
rules
of
he
was
for
sale
he
wanted
to
be
bought
his
price
was
excessively
cheap
for
he
did
not
even
ask
an
office
and
had
his
eye
not
on
the
government
but
on
new
york
all
he
wanted
was
something
to
support
something
that
would
let
itself
be
supported
luck
went
dead
against
him
for
once
he
was
fifty
years
in
advance
of
his
time

and

for

compared
with
the
delight
of
this
the

its

and

the

the

gave
no
sense
of

against
a
stingy
nature

full
outlines
of
the

carried
no
hidden
horror
of

in
its
bosom
the
brooding
heat
of
the
profligate
vegetation
the
cool
charm
of
the
running

the
terrific
splendor
of
the
june
in
the
deep
and
solitary
woods
were
all
sensual
animal
elemental
no
european
spring
had
shown
him
the
same
intermixture
of
delicate
grace
and
passionate
depravity
that
marked
the
maryland
may
he
loved
it
too
much
as
though
it
were
greek
and
half
human
he
could
not
leave
it
but
loitered
on
into
july
falling
into
the
southern
ways
of
the
summer
village
about
la
fayette
square
as
one
whose
rights
of
inheritance
could
not
be
questioned
few
americans
were
so
poor
as
to
question
them
in
spite
of
the
fatal
deception
or
undeception
about
grant
political
character
adams
first
winter
in
washington
had
so
much
amused
him
that
he
had
not
a
thought
of
change
he
loved
it
too
much
to
question
its
value
what
did
he
know
about
its
value
or
what
did
any
one
know
his
father
knew
more
about
it
than
any
one
else
in
boston
and
he
was
amused
to
find
that
his
father
whose
recollections
went
back
to
betrayed
for
washington
much
the
same
sentimental
weakness
and
described
the
society
about
president
monroe
much
as
his
son
felt
the
society
about
president
johnson
he
feared
its
effect
on
young
men
with
some
justice
since
it
had
been
fatal
to
two
of
his
brothers
but
he
understood
the
charm
and
he
knew
that
a
life
in
quincy
or
boston
was
not
likely
to
deaden
it
henry
was
in
a
savage
humor
on
the
subject
of
boston
he
saw
boutwells
at
every
counter
he
found
a
personal
grief
in
every
tree
fifteen
or
twenty
years
afterwards
clarence
king
used
to
amuse
him
by
mourning
over
the
narrow
escape
that
nature
had
made
in
attaining
perfection
except
for
two
mistakes
the
earth
would
have
been
a
success
one
of
these
errors
was
the
inclination
of
the
ecliptic
the
other
was
the
differentiation
of
the
sexes
and
the
saddest
thought
about
the
last
was
that
it
should
have
been
so
modern
adams
in
his
splenetic
temper
held
that
both
these
unnecessary
evils
had
wreaked
their
worst
on
boston
the
climate
made
eternal
war
on
society
and
sex
was
a
species
of
crime
the
ecliptic
had
inclined
itself
beyond
recovery
till
life
was
as
thin
as
the
elm
trees
of
course
he
was
in
the
wrong
the
thinness
was
in
himself
not
in
boston
but
this
is
a
story
of
education
and
adams
was
struggling
to
shape
himself
to
his
time
boston
was
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
everywhere
except
in
washington
americans
were
toiling
for
the
same
object
every
one
complained
of
surroundings
except
where
as
at
washington
there
were
no
surroundings
to
complain
of
boston
kept
its
head
better
than
its
neighbors
did
and
very
little
time
was
needed
to
prove
it
even
to
adams
confusion
before
he
got
back
to
quincy
the
summer
was
already
half
over
and
in
another
six
weeks
the
effects
of
president
grant
character
showed
themselves
they
were
startling
astounding
terrifying
the
mystery
that
shrouded
the
famous
classical
attempt
of
jay
gould
to
corner
gold
in
september
has
never
been
cleared
up
at
least
so
far
as
to
make
it
intelligible
to
adams
gould
was
led
by
the
change
at
washington
into
the
belief
that
he
could
safely
corner
gold
without
interference
from
the
government
he
took
a
number
of
precautions
which
he
admitted
and
he
spent
a
large
sum
of
money
as
he
also
testified
to
obtain
assurances
which
were
not
sufficient
to
have
satisfied
so
astute
a
gambler
yet
he
made
the
venture
any
criminal
lawyer
must
have
begun
investigation
by
insisting
rigorously
that
no
such
man
in
such
a
position
could
be
permitted
to
plead
that
he
had
taken
and
pursued
such
a
course
without
assurances
which
did
satisfy
him
the
plea
was
professionally
inadmissible
this
meant
that
any
criminal
lawyer
would
have
been
bound
to
start
an
investigation
by
insisting
that
gould
had
assurances
from
the
white
house
or
the
treasury
since
none
other
could
have
satisfied
him
to
young
men
wasting
their
summer
at
quincy
for
want
of
some
one
to
hire
their
services
at
three
dollars
a
day
such
a
dramatic
scandal
was
charles
and
henry
adams
jumped
at
it
like
salmon
at
a
fly
with
as
much
voracity
as
jay
gould
or
his
ame
damnee
jim
fisk
had
ever
shown
for
erie
and
with
as
little
fear
of
consequences
they
risked
something
no
one
could
say
what
but
the
people
about
the
erie
office
were
not
regarded
as
lambs
the
unravelling
a
skein
so
tangled
as
that
of
the
erie
railway
was
a
task
that
might
have
given
months
of
labor
to
the
most
efficient
district
attorney
with
all
his
official
tools
to
work
with
charles
took
the
railway
history
henry
took
the
gold
conspiracy
and
they
went
to
new
york
to
work
it
up
the
surface
was
in
full
view
they
had
no
trouble
in
wall
street
and
they
paid
their
respects
in
person
to
the
famous
jim
fisk
in
his
palace
but
the
new
york
side
of
the
story
helped
henry
little
he
needed
to
penetrate
the
political
mystery
and
for
this
purpose
he
had
to
wait
for
congress
to
meet
at
first
he
feared
that
congress
would
suppress
the
scandal
but
the
congressional
investigation
was
ordered
and
took
place
he
soon
knew
all
that
was
to
be
known
the
material
for
his
essay
was
furnished
by
the
government
material
furnished
by
a
government
seldom
satisfies
critics
or
historians
for
it
lies
always
under
suspicion
here
was
a
mystery
and
as
usual
the
chief
mystery
was
the
means
of
making
sure
that
any
mystery
existed
all
adams
great
friends
fish
cox
hoar
evarts
sumner
and
their
surroundings
were
precisely
the
persons
most
mystified
they
knew
less
than
adams
did
they
sought
information
and
frankly
admitted
that
their
relations
with
the
white
house
and
the
treasury
were
not
confidential
no
one
volunteered
advice
no
one
offered
suggestion
one
got
no
light
even
from
the
press
although
press
agents
expressed
in
private
the
most
damning
convictions
with
their
usual
cynical
frankness
the
congressional
committee
took
a
quantity
of
evidence
which
it
dared
not
probe
and
refused
to
analyze
although
the
fault
lay
somewhere
on
the
administration
and
could
lie
nowhere
else
the
trail
always
faded
and
died
out
at
the
point
where
any
member
of
the
administration
became
visible
every
one
dreaded
to
press
inquiry
adams
himself
feared
finding
out
too
much
he
found
out
too
much
already
when
he
saw
in
evidence
that
jay
gould
had
actually
succeeded
in
stretching
his
net
over
grant
closest
surroundings
and
that
boutwell
incompetence
was
the
bottom
of
gould
calculation
with
the
conventional
air
of
assumed
confidence
every
one
in
public
assured
every
one
else
that
the
president
himself
was
the
savior
of
the
situation
and
in
private
assured
each
other
that
if
the
president
had
not
been
caught
this
time
he
was
sure
to
be
trapped
the
next
for
the
ways
of
wall
street
were
dark
and
double
all
this
was
wildly
exciting
to
adams
that
grant
should
have
fallen
within
six
months
into
such
a
morass
or
should
have
let
boutwell
drop
him
into
it
rendered
the
outlook
for
the
next
four
years
probably
eight
possibly
twelve
mysterious
or
frankly
opaque
to
a
young
man
who
had
hitched
his
wagon
as
emerson
told
him
to
the
star
of
reform
the
country
might
outlive
it
but
not
he
the
worst
scandals
of
the
eighteenth
century
were
relatively
harmless
by
the
side
of
this
which
smirched
executive
judiciary
banks
corporate
systems
professions
and
people
all
the
great
active
forces
of
society
in
one
dirty
cesspool
of
vulgar
corruption
only
six
months
before
this
innocent
young
man
fresh
from
the
cynicism
of
european
diplomacy
had
expected
to
enter
an
honorable
career
in
the
press
as
the
champion
and
confidant
of
a
new
washington
and
already
he
foresaw
a
life
of
wasted
energy
sweeping
the
stables
of
american
society
clear
of
the
endless
corruption
which
his
second
washington
was
quite
certain
to
breed
by
vigorously
shutting
one
eyes
as
though
one
were
an
assistant
secretary
a
writer
for
the
press
might
ignore
the
erie
scandal
and
still
help
his
friends
or
allies
in
the
government
who
were
doing
their
best
to
give
it
an
air
of
decency
but
a
few
weeks
showed
that
the
erie
scandal
was
a
mere
incident
a
rather
vulgar
wall
street
trap
into
which
according
to
one
point
of
view
grant
had
been
drawn
by
jay
gould
or
jay
gould
had
been
misled
by
grant
one
could
hardly
doubt
that
both
of
them
were
astonished
and
disgusted
by
the
result
but
neither
jay
gould
nor
any
other
astute
american
mind
still
less
the
complex
jew
could
ever
have
accustomed
itself
to
the
incredible
and
inexplicable
lapses
of
grant
intelligence
and
perhaps
on
the
whole
gould
was
the
less
mischievous
victim
if
victims
they
both
were
the
same
laxity
that
led
gould
into
a
trap
which
might
easily
have
become
the
penitentiary
led
the
united
states
senate
the
executive
departments
and
the
judiciary
into
confusion
and
that
would
have
been
scandalous
in
a
of
girls
for
satirists
or
comedians
the
study
was
rich
and
endless
and
they
exploited
its
corners
with
happy
results
but
a
young
man
fresh
from
the
rustic
simplicity
of
london
noticed
with
horror
that
the
grossest
satires
on
the
american
senator
and
politician
never
failed
to
excite
the
laughter
and
applause
of
every
audience
rich
and
poor
joined
in
throwing
contempt
on
their
own
representatives
society
laughed
a
vacant
and
meaningless
derision
over
its
own
failure
nothing
remained
for
a
young
man
without
position
or
power
except
to
laugh
too
yet
the
spectacle
was
no
laughing
matter
to
him
whatever
it
might
be
to
the
public
society
is
immoral
and
immortal
it
can
afford
to
commit
any
kind
of
folly
and
indulge
in
any
sort
of
vice
it
can
not
be
killed
and
the
fragments
that
survive
can
always
laugh
at
the
dead
but
a
young
man
has
only
one
chance
and
brief
time
to
seize
it
any
one
in
power
above
him
can
extinguish
the
chance
he
is
horribly
at
the
mercy
of
fools
and
cowards
one
dull
administration
can
rapidly
drive
out
every
active
subordinate
at
washington
in
every
intelligent
man
about
the
government
prepared
to
go
the
people
would
have
liked
to
go
too
for
they
stood
helpless
before
the
chaos
some
laughed
and
some
raved
all
were
disgusted
but
they
had
to
content
themselves
by
turning
their
backs
and
going
to
work
harder
than
ever
on
their
railroads
and
foundries
they
were
strong
enough
to
carry
even
their
politics
only
the
helpless
remained
stranded
in
washington
the
shrewdest
statesman
of
all
was
boutwell
who
showed
how
he
understood
the
situation
by
turning
out
of
the
treasury
every
one
who
could
interfere
with
his
repose
and
then
locking
himself
up
in
it
alone
what
he
did
there
no
one
knew
his
colleagues
asked
him
in
vain
not
a
word
could
they
get
from
him
either
in
the
cabinet
or
out
of
it
of
suggestion
or
information
on
matters
even
of
vital
interest
the
treasury
as
an
active
influence
ceased
to
exist
boutwell
waited
with
confidence
for
society
to
drag
his
department
out
of
the
mire
as
it
was
sure
to
do
if
he
waited
long
enough
warned
by
his
friends
in
the
cabinet
as
well
as
in
the
treasury
that
boutwell
meant
to
invite
no
support
and
cared
to
receive
none
adams
had
only
the
state
and
interior
departments
left
to
serve
he
wanted
no
better
than
to
serve
them
opposition
was
his
horror
pure
waste
of
energy
a
union
with
northern
democrats
and
southern
rebels
who
never
had
much
in
common
with
any
adams
and
had
never
shown
any
warm
interest
about
them
except
to
drive
them
from
public
life
if
boutwell
turned
him
out
of
the
treasury
with
the
indifference
or
contempt
that
made
even
a
beetle
helpless
mr
fish
opened
the
state
department
freely
and
seemed
to
talk
with
as
much
openness
as
any
could
ask
at
all
events
adams
could
cling
to
this
last
plank
of
salvation
and
make
himself
perhaps
the
recognized
champion
of
mr
fish
in
the
new
york
press
he
never
once
thought
of
his
disaster
between
seward
and
sumner
in
such
an
accident
could
not
occur
again
fish
and
sumner
were
inseparable
and
their
policy
was
sure
to
be
safe
enough
for
support
no
mosquito
could
be
so
unlucky
as
to
be
caught
a
second
time
between
a
secretary
and
a
senator
who
were
both
his
friends
this
dream
of
security
lasted
hardly
longer
than
that
of
adams
saw
sumner
take
possession
of
the
department
and
he
approved
he
saw
sumner
seize
the
british
mission
for
motley
and
he
was
delighted
but
when
he
renewed
his
relations
with
sumner
in
the
winter
of
he
began
slowly
to
grasp
the
idea
that
sumner
had
a
foreign
policy
of
his
own
which
he
proposed
also
to
force
on
the
department
this
was
not
all
secretary
fish
seemed
to
have
vanished
besides
the
department
of
state
over
which
he
nominally
presided
in
the
infant
asylum
on
fourteenth
street
there
had
risen
a
department
of
foreign
relations
over
which
senator
sumner
ruled
with
a
high
hand
at
the
capitol
and
finally
one
clearly
made
out
a
third
foreign
office
in
the
war
department
with
president
grant
himself
for
chief
pressing
a
policy
of
extension
in
the
west
indies
which
no
northeastern
man
ever
approved
for
his
life
adams
could
not
learn
where
to
place
himself
among
all
these
forces
officially
he
would
have
followed
the
responsible
secretary
of
state
but
he
could
not
find
the
secretary
fish
seemed
to
be
friendly
towards
sumner
and
docile
towards
grant
but
he
asserted
as
yet
no
policy
of
his
own
as
for
grant
policy
adams
never
had
a
chance
to
know
fully
what
it
was
but
as
far
as
he
did
know
he
was
ready
to
give
it
ardent
support
the
difficulty
came
only
when
he
heard
sumner
views
which
as
he
had
reason
to
know
were
always
commands
to
be
disregarded
only
by
traitors
little
by
little
sumner
unfolded
his
foreign
policy
and
adams
gasped
with
fresh
astonishment
at
every
new
article
of
the
creed
to
his
profound
regret
he
heard
sumner
begin
by
imposing
his
veto
on
all
extension
within
the
tropics
which
cost
the
island
of
thomas
to
the
united
states
besides
the
bay
of
samana
as
an
alternative
and
ruined
grant
policy
then
he
listened
with
incredulous
stupor
while
sumner
unfolded
his
plan
for
concentrating
and
pressing
every
possible
american
claim
against
england
with
a
view
of
compelling
the
cession
of
canada
to
the
united
states
adams
did
not
then
know
in
fact
he
never
knew
or
could
find
any
one
to
tell
him
what
was
going
on
behind
the
doors
of
the
white
house
he
doubted
whether
mr
fish
or
bancroft
davis
knew
much
more
than
he
the
game
of
was
as
impenetrable
in
foreign
affairs
as
in
the
gold
conspiracy
president
grant
let
every
one
go
on
but
whom
he
supported
adams
could
not
be
expected
to
divine
one
point
alone
seemed
clear
to
a
man
no
longer
so
very
young
who
had
lately
come
from
a
seven
years
residence
in
london
he
thought
he
knew
as
much
as
any
one
in
washington
about
england
and
he
listened
with
the
more
perplexity
to
sumner
talk
because
it
opened
the
gravest
doubts
of
sumner
sanity
if
war
was
his
object
and
canada
were
worth
it
sumner
scheme
showed
genius
and
adams
was
ready
to
treat
it
seriously
but
if
he
thought
he
could
obtain
canada
from
england
as
a
voluntary
to
the
alabama
claims
he
drivelled
on
the
point
of
fact
adams
was
as
peremptory
as
sumner
on
the
point
of
policy
but
he
could
only
wonder
whether
mr
fish
would
dare
say
it
when
at
last
mr
fish
did
say
it
a
year
later
sumner
publicly
cut
his
acquaintance
adams
was
the
more
puzzled
because
he
could
not
believe
sumner
so
mad
as
to
quarrel
both
with
fish
and
with
grant
a
quarrel
with
seward
and
andrew
johnson
was
bad
enough
and
had
profited
no
one
but
a
quarrel
with
general
grant
was
lunacy
grant
might
be
whatever
one
liked
as
far
as
morals
or
temper
or
intellect
were
concerned
but
he
was
not
a
man
whom
a
cared
to
challenge
for
a
fight
and
sumner
whether
he
knew
it
or
not
was
a
very
light
weight
in
the
republican
party
if
separated
from
his
committee
of
foreign
relations
as
a
party
manager
he
had
not
the
weight
of
men
whose
very
names
were
unknown
to
him
between
these
great
forces
where
was
the
administration
and
how
was
one
to
support
it
one
must
first
find
it
and
even
then
it
was
not
easily
caught
grant
simplicity
was
more
disconcerting
than
the
complexity
of
a
talleyrand
mr
fish
afterwards
told
adams
with
the
rather
grim
humor
he
sometimes
indulged
in
that
grant
took
a
dislike
to
motley
because
he
parted
his
hair
in
the
middle
adams
repeated
the
story
to
godkin
who
made
much
play
with
it
in
the
nation
till
it
was
denied
adams
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
be
denied
grant
had
as
good
a
right
to
dislike
the
hair
as
the
head
if
the
hair
seemed
to
him
a
part
of
it
very
shrewd
men
have
formed
very
sound
judgments
on
less
material
than
hair
on
clothes
for
example
according
to
carlyle
or
on
a
pen
according
to
cardinal
de
retz
and
nine
men
in
ten
could
hardly
give
as
good
a
reason
as
hair
for
their
likes
or
dislikes
in
truth
grant
disliked
motley
at
sight
because
they
had
nothing
in
common
and
for
the
same
reason
he
disliked
sumner
for
the
same
reason
he
would
be
sure
to
dislike
adams
if
adams
gave
him
a
chance
even
fish
could
not
be
quite
sure
of
grant
except
for
the
powerful
effect
which
wealth
had
or
appeared
to
have
on
grant
imagination
the
quarrel
that
lowered
over
the
state
department
did
not
break
in
storm
till
july
after
adams
had
vanished
but
another
quarrel
almost
as
fatal
to
adams
as
that
between
fish
and
sumner
worried
him
even
more
of
all
members
of
the
cabinet
the
one
whom
he
had
most
personal
interest
in
cultivating
was
attorney
general
hoar
the
legal
tender
decision
which
had
been
the
first
to
adams
at
washington
grew
in
interest
till
it
threatened
to
become
something
more
serious
than
a
block
it
fell
on
one
head
like
a
plaster
ceiling
and
could
not
be
escaped
the
impending
battle
between
fish
and
sumner
was
nothing
like
so
serious
as
the
outbreak
between
hoar
and
chief
justice
chase
adams
had
come
to
washington
hoping
to
support
the
executive
in
a
policy
of
breaking
down
the
senate
but
he
never
dreamed
that
he
would
be
required
to
help
in
breaking
down
the
supreme
court
although
step
by
step
he
had
been
driven
like
the
rest
of
the
world
to
admit
that
american
society
had
outgrown
most
of
its
institutions
he
still
clung
to
the
supreme
court
much
as
a
churchman
clings
to
his
bishops
because
they
are
his
only
symbol
of
unity
his
last
rag
of
right
between
the
executive
and
the
legislature
citizens
could
have
no
rights
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
power
they
had
created
the
court
to
protect
them
from
unlimited
power
and
it
was
little
enough
protection
at
best
adams
wanted
to
save
the
independence
of
the
court
at
least
for
his
lifetime
and
could
not
conceive
that
the
executive
should
wish
to
overthrow
it
frank
walker
shared
this
feeling
and
by
way
of
helping
the
court
he
had
promised
adams
for
the
north
american
review
an
article
on
the
history
of
the
legal
tender
act
founded
on
a
volume
just
then
published
by
spaulding
the
putative
father
of
the
clause
in
secretary
jacob
cox
who
alone
sympathized
with
reform
saved
from
boutwell
decree
of
banishment
such
reformers
as
he
could
find
place
for
and
he
saved
walker
for
a
time
by
giving
him
the
census
of
walker
was
obliged
to
abandon
his
article
for
the
north
american
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
the
census
he
gave
adams
his
notes
and
adams
completed
the
article
he
had
not
toiled
in
vain
over
the
bank
of
england
restriction
he
knew
enough
about
legal
tender
to
leave
it
alone
if
the
banks
and
bankers
wanted
fiat
money
fiat
money
was
good
enough
for
a
and
if
they
changed
about
and
wanted
intrinsic
value
gold
and
silver
came
equally
welcome
to
a
writer
who
was
paid
half
the
wages
of
an
ordinary
mechanic
he
had
no
notion
of
attacking
or
defending
legal
tender
his
object
was
to
defend
the
chief
justice
and
the
court
walker
argued
that
whatever
might
afterwards
have
been
the
necessity
for
legal
tender
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed
with
the
help
of
the
chief
justice
recollections
adams
completed
the
article
which
appeared
in
the
april
number
of
the
north
american
its
ferocity
was
walker
for
adams
never
cared
to
abandon
the
knife
for
the
hatchet
but
walker
reeked
of
the
army
and
the
springfield
republican
and
his
energy
ran
away
with
restraint
the
unfortunate
spaulding
complained
loudly
of
this
treatment
not
without
justice
but
the
article
itself
had
serious
historical
value
for
walker
demolished
every
shred
of
contention
that
legal
tender
was
necessary
at
the
time
and
the
chief
justice
told
his
part
of
the
story
with
conviction
the
chief
justice
seemed
to
be
pleased
the
attorney
general
pleased
or
not
made
no
sign
the
article
had
enough
historical
interest
to
induce
adams
to
reprint
it
in
a
volume
of
essays
twenty
years
afterwards
but
its
historical
value
was
not
its
point
in
education
the
point
was
that
in
spite
of
the
best
intentions
the
plainest
and
the
strongest
wish
to
escape
further
trouble
the
article
threw
adams
into
opposition
judge
hoar
like
boutwell
was
implacable
hoar
went
on
to
demolish
the
chief
justice
while
henry
adams
went
on
drifting
further
and
further
from
the
administration
he
did
this
in
common
with
all
the
world
including
hoar
himself
scarcely
a
newspaper
in
the
country
kept
discipline
the
new
york
tribune
was
one
of
the
most
criminal
dissolution
of
ties
in
every
direction
marked
the
dissolution
of
temper
and
the
senate
chamber
became
again
a
scene
of
irritated
egotism
that
passed
ridicule
senators
quarrelled
with
each
other
and
no
one
objected
but
they
picked
quarrels
also
with
the
executive
and
threw
every
department
into
confusion
among
others
they
quarrelled
with
hoar
and
drove
him
from
office
that
sumner
and
hoar
the
two
new
englanders
in
great
position
who
happened
to
be
the
two
persons
most
necessary
for
his
success
at
washington
should
be
the
first
victims
of
grant
lax
rule
must
have
had
some
meaning
for
adams
education
if
adams
could
only
have
understood
what
it
was
he
studied
but
failed
sympathy
with
him
was
not
their
weakness
directly
in
the
form
of
help
he
knew
he
could
hope
as
little
from
them
as
from
boutwell
so
far
from
inviting
attachment
they
like
other
new
englanders
blushed
to
own
a
friend
not
one
of
the
whole
delegation
would
ever
of
his
own
accord
try
to
help
adams
or
any
other
young
man
who
did
not
beg
for
it
although
they
would
always
accept
whatever
services
they
had
not
to
pay
for
the
lesson
of
education
was
not
there
the
selfishness
of
politics
was
the
earliest
of
all
political
education
and
adams
had
nothing
to
learn
from
its
study
but
the
situation
struck
him
as
curious
so
curious
that
he
devoted
years
to
reflecting
upon
it
his
four
most
powerful
friends
had
matched
themselves
two
and
two
and
were
fighting
in
pairs
to
a
finish
with
foreign
affairs
and
the
judiciary
as
prizes
what
value
had
the
fight
in
education
adams
was
puzzled
and
was
not
the
only
puzzled
bystander
the
of
statesman
was
amusing
whether
as
roscoe
conkling
or
colonel
mulberry
sellers
but
what
was
his
value
the
statesmen
of
the
old
type
whether
sumners
or
conklings
or
hoars
or
lamars
were
personally
as
honest
as
human
nature
could
produce
they
trod
with
lofty
contempt
on
other
people
jobs
especially
when
there
was
good
in
them
yet
the
public
thought
that
sumner
and
conkling
cost
the
country
a
hundred
times
more
than
all
the
jobs
they
ever
trod
on
just
as
lamar
and
the
old
southern
statesmen
who
were
also
honest
in
cost
the
country
a
civil
war
this
painful
moral
doubt
worried
adams
less
than
it
worried
his
friends
and
the
public
but
it
affected
the
whole
field
of
politics
for
twenty
years
the
newspapers
discussed
little
else
than
the
alleged
moral
laxity
of
grant
garfield
and
blaine
if
the
press
were
taken
seriously
politics
turned
on
jobs
and
some
of
adams
best
friends
like
godkin
ruined
their
influence
by
their
insistence
on
points
of
morals
society
hesitated
wavered
oscillated
between
harshness
and
laxity
pitilessly
sacrificing
the
weak
and
deferentially
following
the
strong
in
spite
of
all
such
criticism
the
public
nominated
grant
garfield
and
blaine
for
the
presidency
and
voted
for
them
afterwards
not
seeming
to
care
for
the
question
until
young
men
were
forced
to
see
that
either
some
new
standard
must
be
created
or
none
could
be
upheld
the
moral
law
had
expired
like
the
constitution
grant
administration
outraged
every
rule
of
ordinary
decency
but
scores
of
promising
men
whom
the
country
could
not
well
spare
were
ruined
in
saying
so
the
world
cared
little
for
decency
what
it
wanted
it
did
not
know
probably
a
system
that
would
work
and
men
who
could
work
it
but
it
found
neither
adams
had
tried
his
own
little
hands
on
it
and
had
failed
his
friends
had
been
driven
out
of
washington
or
had
taken
to
fisticuffs
he
himself
sat
down
and
stared
helplessly
into
the
future
the
result
was
a
review
of
the
session
for
the
july
north
american
into
which
he
crammed
and
condensed
everything
he
thought
he
had
observed
and
all
he
had
been
told
he
thought
it
good
history
then
and
he
thought
it
better
twenty
years
afterwards
he
thought
it
even
good
enough
to
reprint
as
it
happened
in
the
process
of
his
devious
education
this
session
of
proved
to
be
his
last
study
in
current
politics
and
his
last
dying
testament
as
a
humble
member
of
the
press
as
such
he
stood
by
it
he
could
have
said
no
more
had
he
gone
on
reviewing
every
session
in
the
rest
of
the
century
the
political
dilemma
was
as
clear
in
as
it
was
likely
to
be
in
the
system
of
had
broken
down
and
with
it
the
fabric
of
a
priori
or
moral
principles
politicians
had
tacitly
given
it
up
grant
administration
marked
the
avowal
of
political
energies
must
henceforth
be
wasted
on
expedients
to
piece
out
to
patch
or
in
vulgar
language
to
tinker
the
political
machine
as
often
as
it
broke
down
such
a
system
or
want
of
system
might
last
centuries
if
tempered
by
an
occasional
revolution
or
civil
war
but
as
a
machine
it
was
or
soon
would
be
the
poorest
in
the
world
the
clumsiest
the
most
inefficient
here
again
was
an
education
but
what
it
was
worth
he
could
not
guess
indeed
when
he
raised
his
eyes
to
the
loftiest
and
most
triumphant
results
of
politics
to
boutwell
conkling
or
even
sumner
he
could
not
honestly
say
that
such
an
education
even
when
it
carried
one
up
to
these
unattainable
heights
was
worth
anything
there
were
men
as
yet
standing
on
lower
levels
clever
and
amusing
men
like
garfield
and
blaine
who
took
no
little
pleasure
in
making
fun
of
the
senatorial
and
who
used
language
about
grant
himself
which
the
north
american
review
would
not
have
admitted
one
asked
doubtfully
what
was
likely
to
become
of
these
men
in
their
turn
what
kind
of
political
ambition
was
to
result
from
this
destructive
political
education
yet
the
sum
of
political
life
was
or
should
have
been
the
attainment
of
a
working
political
system
society
needed
to
reach
it
if
moral
standards
broke
down
and
machinery
stopped
working
new
morals
and
machinery
of
some
sort
had
to
be
invented
an
eternity
of
grants
or
even
of
garfields
or
of
conklings
or
of
jay
goulds
refused
to
be
conceived
as
possible
practical
americans
laughed
and
went
their
way
society
paid
them
to
be
practical
whenever
society
cared
to
pay
adams
he
too
would
be
practical
take
his
pay
and
hold
his
tongue
but
meanwhile
he
was
driven
to
associate
with
democratic
congressmen
and
educate
them
he
served
david
wells
as
an
active
assistant
professor
of
revenue
reform
and
turned
his
rooms
into
a
college
the
administration
drove
him
and
thousands
of
other
young
men
into
active
enmity
not
only
to
grant
but
to
the
system
or
want
of
system
which
took
possession
of
the
president
every
hope
or
thought
which
had
brought
adams
to
washington
proved
to
be
absurd
no
one
wanted
him
no
one
wanted
any
of
his
friends
in
reform
the
blackmailer
alone
was
the
normal
product
of
politics
as
of
business
all
this
was
excessively
amusing
adams
never
had
been
so
busy
so
interested
so
much
in
the
thick
of
the
crowd
he
knew
congressmen
by
scores
and
by
the
dozen
he
wrote
for
his
various
organs
all
sorts
of
attacks
and
defences
he
enjoyed
the
life
enormously
and
found
himself
as
happy
as
sam
ward
or
sunset
cox
much
happier
than
his
friends
fish
or
cox
or
chief
justice
chase
or
attorney
general
hoar
or
charles
sumner
when
spring
came
he
took
to
the
woods
which
were
best
of
all
for
after
the
first
of
april
what
maurice
de
guerin
called
the
vast
maternity
of
nature
showed
charms
more
voluptuous
than
the
vast
paternity
of
the
united
states
senate
senators
were
less
ornamental
than
the
dogwood
or
even
the
they
were
as
a
rule
less
good
company
adams
astonished
himself
by
remarking
what
a
purified
charm
was
lent
to
the
capitol
by
the
greatest
possible
distance
as
one
caught
glimpses
of
the
dome
over
miles
of
forest
foliage
at
such
moments
he
pondered
on
the
distant
beauty
of
peter
and
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
yet
he
shortened
his
spring
for
he
needed
to
get
back
to
london
for
the
season
he
had
finished
his
new
york
gold
conspiracy
which
he
meant
for
his
friend
henry
reeve
and
the
edinburgh
review
it
was
the
best
piece
of
work
he
had
done
but
this
was
not
his
reason
for
publishing
it
in
england
the
erie
scandal
had
provoked
a
sort
of
revolt
among
respectable
new
yorkers
as
well
as
among
some
who
were
not
so
respectable
and
the
attack
on
erie
was
beginning
to
promise
success
london
was
a
sensitive
spot
for
the
erie
management
and
it
was
thought
well
to
strike
them
there
where
they
were
socially
and
financially
exposed
the
tactics
suited
him
in
another
way
for
any
expression
about
america
in
an
english
review
attracted
ten
times
the
attention
in
america
that
the
same
article
would
attract
in
the
north
american
habitually
the
american
dailies
reprinted
such
articles
in
full
adams
wanted
to
escape
the
terrors
of
copyright
his
highest
ambition
was
to
be
pirated
and
advertised
free
of
charge
since
in
any
case
his
pay
was
nothing
under
the
excitement
of
chase
he
was
becoming
a
pirate
himself
and
liked
it
chapter
xix
chaos
one
fine
may
afternoon
in
adams
drove
again
up
street
wondering
more
than
ever
at
the
marvels
of
life
nine
years
had
passed
since
the
historic
entrance
of
may
outwardly
london
was
the
same
outwardly
europe
showed
no
great
change
palmerston
and
russell
were
forgotten
but
disraeli
and
gladstone
were
still
much
alive
one
friends
were
more
than
ever
prominent
john
bright
was
in
the
cabinet
forster
was
about
to
enter
it
reform
ran
riot
never
had
the
sun
of
progress
shone
so
fair
evolution
from
lower
to
higher
raged
like
an
epidemic
darwin
was
the
greatest
of
prophets
in
the
most
evolutionary
of
worlds
gladstone
had
overthrown
the
irish
church
was
overthrowing
the
irish
landlords
was
trying
to
pass
an
education
act
improvement
prosperity
power
were
leaping
and
bounding
over
every
country
road
even
america
with
her
erie
scandals
and
alabama
claims
hardly
made
a
discordant
note
at
the
legation
motley
ruled
the
long
adams
reign
was
forgotten
the
rebellion
had
passed
into
history
in
society
no
one
cared
to
recall
the
years
before
the
prince
of
wales
the
smart
set
had
come
to
their
own
half
the
houses
that
adams
had
frequented
from
to
were
closed
or
closing
in
death
had
ravaged
one
circle
of
friends
milnes
gaskell
and
her
sister
miss
charlotte
wynn
were
both
dead
and
james
milnes
gaskell
was
no
longer
in
parliament
that
field
of
education
seemed
closed
too
one
found
one
self
in
a
singular
frame
of
mind
more
than
ever
almost
rococo
and
unable
to
catch
anywhere
the
of
evolution
experience
ceased
to
educate
london
taught
less
freely
than
of
old
that
one
bad
style
was
leading
to
another
that
the
older
men
were
more
amusing
than
the
younger
that
lord
houghton
showed
gaps
hard
to
fill
that
there
were
fewer
men
one
wanted
to
meet
these
and
a
hundred
more
such
remarks
helped
little
towards
a
quicker
and
more
intelligent
activity
for
english
reforms
adams
cared
nothing
the
reforms
were
themselves
mediaeval
the
education
bill
of
his
friend
forster
seemed
to
him
a
guaranty
against
all
education
he
had
use
for
he
resented
change
he
would
have
kept
the
pope
in
the
vatican
and
the
queen
at
windsor
castle
as
historical
monuments
he
did
not
care
to
americanize
europe
the
bastille
or
the
ghetto
was
a
curiosity
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
if
preserved
and
so
was
a
bishop
so
was
napoleon
iii
the
tourist
was
the
great
conservative
who
hated
novelty
and
adored
dirt
adams
came
back
to
london
without
a
thought
of
revolution
or
restlessness
or
reform
he
wanted
amusement
quiet
and
gaiety
had
he
not
been
born
in
under
the
shadow
of
boston
state
house
and
been
brought
up
in
the
early
victorian
epoch
he
would
have
cast
off
his
old
skin
and
made
his
court
to
marlborough
house
in
partnership
with
the
american
woman
and
the
jew
banker
dictated
it
but
adams
and
his
friends
were
unfashionable
by
some
law
of
custom
some
innate
atrophy
of
mind
figuring
himself
as
already
a
man
of
action
and
rather
far
up
towards
the
front
he
had
no
idea
of
making
a
new
effort
or
catching
up
with
a
new
world
he
saw
nothing
ahead
of
him
the
world
was
never
more
calm
he
wanted
to
talk
with
ministers
about
the
alabama
claims
because
he
looked
on
the
claims
as
his
own
special
creation
discussed
between
him
and
his
father
long
before
they
had
been
discussed
by
government
he
wanted
to
make
notes
for
his
next
year
articles
but
he
had
not
a
thought
that
within
three
months
his
world
was
to
be
upset
and
he
under
it
frank
palgrave
came
one
day
more
contentious
contemptuous
and
paradoxical
than
ever
because
napoleon
iii
seemed
to
be
threatening
war
with
germany
palgrave
said
that
germany
would
beat
france
into
scraps
if
there
was
war
adams
thought
not
the
chances
were
always
against
catastrophes
no
one
else
expected
great
changes
in
europe
palgrave
was
always
extreme
his
language
was
incautious
violent
in
this
year
of
all
years
adams
lost
sight
of
education
things
began
smoothly
and
london
glowed
with
the
pleasant
sense
of
familiarity
and
dinners
he
sniffed
with
voluptuous
delight
the
of
cheapside
and
revelled
in
the
architecture
of
oxford
street
may
fair
never
shone
so
fair
to
arthur
pendennis
as
it
did
to
the
returned
american
the
country
never
smiled
its
velvet
smile
of
trained
and
easy
hostess
as
it
did
when
he
was
so
lucky
as
to
be
asked
on
a
country
visit
he
loved
it
all
everything
had
always
loved
it
he
felt
almost
attached
to
the
royal
exchange
he
thought
he
owned
the
james
club
he
patronized
the
legation
the
first
shock
came
lightly
as
though
nature
were
playing
tricks
on
her
spoiled
child
though
she
had
thus
far
not
exerted
herself
to
spoil
him
reeve
refused
the
gold
conspiracy
adams
had
become
used
to
the
idea
that
he
was
free
of
the
quarterlies
and
that
his
writing
would
be
printed
of
course
but
he
was
stunned
by
the
reason
of
refusal
reeve
said
it
would
bring
libel
suits
on
him
one
knew
that
the
power
of
erie
was
almost
as
great
in
england
as
in
america
but
one
was
hardly
prepared
to
find
it
controlling
the
quarterlies
the
english
press
professed
to
be
shocked
in
by
the
erie
scandal
as
it
had
professed
in
to
be
shocked
by
the
scandal
of
slavery
but
when
invited
to
support
those
who
were
trying
to
abate
these
scandals
the
english
press
said
it
was
afraid
to
adams
refusal
seemed
portentous
he
and
his
brother
and
the
north
american
review
were
running
greater
risks
every
day
and
no
one
thought
of
fear
that
a
notorious
story
taken
bodily
from
an
official
document
should
scare
the
edinburgh
review
into
silence
for
fear
of
jay
gould
and
jim
fisk
passed
even
adams
experience
of
english
eccentricity
though
it
was
large
he
gladly
set
down
reeve
refusal
of
the
gold
conspiracy
to
respectability
and
editorial
law
but
when
he
sent
the
manuscript
on
to
the
quarterly
the
editor
of
the
quarterly
also
refused
it
the
literary
standard
of
the
two
quarterlies
was
not
so
high
as
to
suggest
that
the
article
was
illiterate
beyond
the
power
of
an
active
and
willing
editor
to
redeem
it
adams
had
no
choice
but
to
realize
that
he
had
to
deal
in
with
the
same
old
english
character
of
and
the
same
inability
in
himself
to
understand
it
as
usual
when
an
ally
was
needed
the
american
was
driven
into
the
arms
of
the
radicals
respectability
everywhere
and
always
turned
its
back
the
moment
one
asked
to
do
it
a
favor
called
suddenly
away
from
england
he
despatched
the
article
at
the
last
moment
to
the
westminster
review
and
heard
no
more
about
it
for
nearly
six
months
he
had
been
some
weeks
in
london
when
he
received
a
telegram
from
his
at
the
bagni
di
lucca
telling
him
that
his
sister
had
been
thrown
from
a
cab
and
injured
and
that
he
had
better
come
on
he
started
that
night
and
reached
the
bagni
di
lucca
on
the
second
day
tetanus
had
already
set
in
the
last
lesson
the
sum
and
term
of
education
began
then
he
had
passed
through
thirty
years
of
rather
varied
experience
without
having
once
felt
the
shell
of
custom
broken
he
had
never
seen
nature
only
her
surface
the
that
she
shows
to
youth
flung
suddenly
in
his
face
with
the
harsh
brutality
of
chance
the
terror
of
the
blow
stayed
by
him
thenceforth
for
life
until
repetition
made
it
more
than
the
will
could
struggle
with
more
than
he
could
call
on
himself
to
bear
he
found
his
sister
a
woman
of
forty
as
gay
and
brilliant
in
the
terrors
of
lockjaw
as
she
had
been
in
the
careless
fun
of
lying
in
bed
in
consequence
of
a
miserable
that
had
bruised
her
foot
hour
by
hour
the
muscles
grew
rigid
while
the
mind
remained
bright
until
after
ten
days
of
fiendish
torture
she
died
in
convulsion
one
had
heard
and
read
a
great
deal
about
death
and
even
seen
a
little
of
it
and
knew
by
heart
the
thousand
commonplaces
of
religion
and
poetry
which
seemed
to
deaden
one
senses
and
veil
the
horror
society
being
immortal
could
put
on
immortality
at
will
adams
being
mortal
felt
only
the
mortality
death
took
features
altogether
new
to
him
in
these
rich
and
sensuous
surroundings
nature
enjoyed
it
played
with
it
the
horror
added
to
her
charm
she
liked
the
torture
and
smothered
her
victim
with
caresses
never
had
one
seen
her
so
winning
the
hot
italian
summer
brooded
outside
over
the
and
the
picturesque
peasants
and
in
the
singular
color
of
the
tuscan
atmosphere
the
hills
and
vineyards
of
the
apennines
seemed
bursting
with
blood
the
itself
glowed
with
the
italian
joy
of
life
friends
filled
it
no
harsh
northern
lights
pierced
the
soft
shadows
even
the
dying
women
shared
the
sense
of
the
italian
summer
the
soft
velvet
air
the
humor
the
courage
the
sensual
fulness
of
nature
and
man
she
faced
death
as
women
mostly
do
bravely
and
even
gaily
racked
slowly
to
unconsciousness
but
yielding
only
to
violence
as
a
soldier
sabred
in
battle
for
many
thousands
of
years
on
these
hills
and
plains
nature
had
gone
on
sabring
men
and
women
with
the
same
air
of
sensual
pleasure
impressions
like
these
are
not
reasoned
or
catalogued
in
the
mind
they
are
felt
as
part
of
violent
emotion
and
the
mind
that
feels
them
is
a
different
one
from
that
which
reasons
it
is
thought
of
a
different
power
and
a
different
person
the
first
serious
consciousness
of
nature
gesture
her
attitude
towards
life
took
form
then
as
a
phantasm
a
nightmare
an
insanity
of
force
for
the
first
time
the
of
the
senses
collapsed
the
human
mind
felt
itself
stripped
naked
vibrating
in
a
void
of
shapeless
energies
with
resistless
mass
colliding
crushing
wasting
and
destroying
what
these
same
energies
had
created
and
labored
from
eternity
to
perfect
society
became
fantastic
a
vision
of
pantomime
with
a
mechanical
motion
and
its
thought
merged
in
the
mere
sense
of
life
and
pleasure
in
the
sense
the
usual
anodynes
of
social
medicine
became
evident
artifice
stoicism
was
perhaps
the
best
religion
was
the
most
human
but
the
idea
that
any
personal
deity
could
find
pleasure
or
profit
in
torturing
a
poor
woman
by
accident
with
a
fiendish
cruelty
known
to
man
only
in
perverted
and
insane
temperaments
could
not
be
held
for
a
moment
for
pure
blasphemy
it
made
pure
atheism
a
comfort
god
might
be
as
the
church
said
a
substance
but
he
could
not
be
a
person
with
nerves
strained
for
the
first
time
beyond
their
power
of
tension
he
slowly
travelled
northwards
with
his
friends
and
stopped
for
a
few
days
at
ouchy
to
recover
his
balance
in
a
new
world
for
the
fantastic
mystery
of
coincidences
had
made
the
world
which
he
thought
real
mimic
and
reproduce
the
distorted
nightmare
of
his
personal
horror
he
did
not
yet
know
it
and
he
was
twenty
years
in
finding
it
out
but
he
had
need
of
all
the
beauty
of
the
lake
below
and
of
the
alps
above
to
restore
the
finite
to
its
place
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
mont
blanc
for
a
moment
looked
to
him
what
it
was
a
chaos
of
anarchic
and
purposeless
forces
and
he
needed
days
of
repose
to
see
it
clothe
itself
again
with
the
illusions
of
his
senses
the
white
purity
of
its
snows
the
splendor
of
its
light
and
the
infinity
of
its
heavenly
peace
nature
was
kind
lake
geneva
was
beautiful
beyond
itself
and
the
alps
put
on
charms
real
as
terrors
but
man
became
chaotic
and
before
the
illusions
of
nature
were
wholly
restored
the
illusions
of
europe
suddenly
vanished
leaving
a
new
world
to
learn
on
july
all
europe
had
been
in
peace
on
july
europe
was
in
full
chaos
of
war
one
felt
helpless
and
ignorant
but
one
might
have
been
king
or
kaiser
without
feeling
stronger
to
deal
with
the
chaos
gladstone
was
as
much
astounded
as
adams
the
emperor
napoleon
was
nearly
as
stupefied
as
either
and
bismarck
himself
hardly
knew
how
he
did
it
as
education
the
of
the
war
was
wholly
lost
on
a
man
dealing
with
death
who
could
not
throw
it
aside
to
look
at
it
across
the
rhine
only
when
he
got
up
to
paris
he
began
to
feel
the
approach
of
catastrophe
providence
set
up
no
affiches
to
announce
the
tragedy
under
one
eyes
france
cut
herself
adrift
and
floated
off
on
an
unknown
stream
towards
a
less
known
ocean
standing
on
the
curb
of
the
boulevard
one
could
see
as
much
as
though
one
stood
by
the
side
of
the
emperor
or
in
command
of
an
army
corps
the
effect
was
lurid
the
public
seemed
to
look
on
the
war
as
it
had
looked
on
the
wars
of
louis
xiv
and
francis
i
as
a
branch
of
decorative
art
the
french
like
true
artists
always
regarded
war
as
one
of
the
fine
arts
louis
xiv
practiced
it
napoleon
i
perfected
it
and
napoleon
iii
had
till
then
pursued
it
in
the
same
spirit
with
singular
success
in
paris
in
july
the
war
was
brought
out
like
an
opera
of
meyerbeer
one
felt
one
self
a
supernumerary
hired
to
fill
the
scene
every
evening
at
the
theatre
the
comedy
was
interrupted
by
order
and
one
stood
up
by
order
to
join
in
singing
the
marseillaise
to
order
for
nearly
twenty
years
one
had
been
forbidden
to
sing
the
marseillaise
under
any
circumstances
but
at
last
regiment
after
regiment
marched
through
the
streets
shouting
marchons
while
the
bystanders
cared
not
enough
to
join
patriotism
seemed
to
have
been
brought
out
of
the
government
stores
and
distributed
by
grammes
per
capita
one
had
seen
one
own
people
dragged
unwillingly
into
a
war
and
had
watched
one
own
regiments
march
to
the
front
without
sign
of
enthusiasm
on
the
contrary
most
serious
anxious
and
conscious
of
the
whole
weight
of
the
crisis
but
in
paris
every
one
conspired
to
ignore
the
crisis
which
every
one
felt
at
hand
here
was
education
for
the
million
but
the
lesson
was
intricate
superficially
napoleon
and
his
ministers
and
marshals
were
playing
a
game
against
thiers
and
gambetta
a
bystander
knew
almost
as
little
as
they
did
about
the
result
how
could
adams
prophesy
that
in
another
year
or
two
when
he
spoke
of
his
paris
and
its
tastes
people
would
smile
at
his
dotage
as
soon
as
he
could
he
fled
to
england
and
once
more
took
refuge
in
the
profound
peace
of
wenlock
abbey
only
the
few
remaining
monks
undisturbed
by
the
brutalities
of
henry
viii
three
or
four
young
englishmen
survived
there
with
milnes
gaskell
acting
as
prior
the
august
sun
was
warm
the
calm
of
the
abbey
was
ten
times
secular
not
a
discordant
sound
hardly
a
sound
of
any
sort
except
the
cawing
of
the
ancient
rookery
at
sunset
broke
the
stillness
and
after
the
excitement
of
the
last
month
one
felt
a
palpable
haze
of
peace
brooding
over
the
edge
and
the
welsh
marches
since
the
reign
of
pteraspis
nothing
had
greatly
changed
nothing
except
the
monks
lying
on
the
turf
the
ground
littered
with
newspapers
the
monks
studied
the
war
correspondence
in
one
respect
adams
had
succeeded
in
educating
himself
he
had
learned
to
follow
a
campaign
while
at
wenlock
he
received
a
letter
from
president
eliot
inviting
him
to
take
an
assistant
professorship
of
history
to
be
created
shortly
at
harvard
college
after
waiting
ten
or
a
dozen
years
for
some
one
to
show
consciousness
of
his
existence
even
a
terebratula
would
be
pleased
and
grateful
for
a
compliment
which
implied
that
the
new
president
of
harvard
college
wanted
his
help
but
adams
knew
nothing
about
history
and
much
less
about
teaching
while
he
knew
more
than
enough
about
harvard
college
and
wrote
at
once
to
thank
president
eliot
with
much
regret
that
the
honor
should
be
above
his
powers
his
mind
was
full
of
other
matters
the
summer
from
which
he
had
expected
only
amusement
and
social
relations
with
new
people
had
ended
in
the
most
intimate
personal
tragedy
and
the
most
terrific
political
convulsion
he
had
ever
known
or
was
likely
to
know
he
had
failed
in
every
object
of
his
trip
the
quarterlies
had
refused
his
best
essay
he
had
made
no
acquaintances
and
hardly
picked
up
the
old
ones
he
sailed
from
liverpool
on
september
to
begin
again
where
he
had
started
two
years
before
but
with
no
longer
a
hope
of
attaching
himself
to
a
president
or
a
party
or
a
press
he
was
a
free
lance
and
no
other
career
stood
in
sight
or
mind
to
that
point
education
had
brought
him
yet
he
found
on
reaching
home
that
he
had
not
done
quite
so
badly
as
he
feared
his
article
on
the
session
in
the
july
north
american
had
made
a
success
though
he
could
not
quite
see
what
partisan
object
it
served
he
heard
with
flattered
astonishment
that
it
had
been
reprinted
by
the
democratic
national
committee
and
circulated
as
a
campaign
document
by
the
hundred
thousand
copies
he
was
henceforth
in
opposition
do
what
he
might
and
a
massachusetts
democrat
say
what
he
pleased
while
his
only
reward
or
return
for
this
partisan
service
consisted
in
being
formally
answered
by
senator
timothy
howe
of
wisconsin
in
a
republican
campaign
document
presumed
to
be
also
freely
circulated
in
which
the
senator
besides
refuting
his
opinions
did
him
the
honor
most
unusual
and
picturesque
in
a
senator
rhetoric
of
likening
him
to
a
begonia
the
begonia
is
or
then
was
a
plant
of
such
senatorial
qualities
as
to
make
the
simile
in
intention
most
flattering
far
from
charming
in
its
refinement
the
begonia
was
remarkable
for
curious
and
showy
foliage
it
was
conspicuous
it
seemed
to
have
no
useful
purpose
and
it
insisted
on
standing
always
in
the
most
prominent
positions
adams
would
have
greatly
liked
to
be
a
begonia
in
washington
for
this
was
rather
his
ideal
of
the
successful
statesman
and
he
thought
about
it
still
more
when
the
westminster
review
for
october
brought
him
his
article
on
the
gold
conspiracy
which
was
also
instantly
pirated
on
a
great
scale
piratical
he
was
himself
henceforth
driven
to
be
and
he
asked
only
to
be
pirated
for
he
was
sure
not
to
be
paid
but
the
honors
of
piracy
resemble
the
colors
of
the
begonia
they
are
showy
but
not
useful
here
was
a
tour
de
force
he
had
never
dreamed
himself
equal
to
performing
two
long
dry
quarterly
thirty
or
forty
page
articles
appearing
in
quick
succession
and
pirated
for
audiences
running
well
into
the
hundred
thousands
and
not
one
person
man
or
woman
offering
him
so
much
as
a
congratulation
except
to
call
him
a
begonia
had
this
been
all
life
might
have
gone
on
very
happily
as
before
but
the
ways
of
america
to
a
young
person
of
literary
and
political
tastes
were
such
as
the
evolution
of
civilized
man
had
not
before
evolved
no
sooner
had
adams
made
at
washington
what
he
modestly
hoped
was
a
sufficient
success
than
his
whole
family
set
on
him
to
drag
him
away
for
the
first
time
since
his
father
interposed
his
mother
entreated
and
his
brother
charles
argued
and
urged
that
he
should
come
to
harvard
college
charles
had
views
of
further
joint
operations
in
a
new
field
he
said
that
henry
had
done
at
washington
all
he
could
possibly
do
that
his
position
there
wanted
solidity
that
he
was
after
all
an
adventurer
that
a
few
years
in
cambridge
would
give
him
personal
weight
that
his
chief
function
was
not
to
be
that
of
teacher
but
that
of
editing
the
north
american
review
which
was
to
be
coupled
with
the
professorship
and
would
lead
to
the
daily
press
in
short
that
he
needed
the
university
more
than
the
university
needed
him
henry
knew
the
university
well
enough
to
know
that
the
department
of
history
was
controlled
by
one
of
the
most
astute
and
ideal
administrators
in
the
world
professor
gurney
and
that
it
was
gurney
who
had
established
the
new
professorship
and
had
cast
his
net
over
adams
to
carry
the
double
load
of
mediaeval
history
and
the
review
he
could
see
no
relation
whatever
between
himself
and
a
professorship
he
sought
education
he
did
not
sell
it
he
knew
no
history
he
knew
only
a
few
historians
his
ignorance
was
mischievous
because
it
was
literary
accidental
indifferent
on
the
other
hand
he
knew
gurney
and
felt
much
influenced
by
his
advice
one
can
not
take
one
self
quite
seriously
in
such
matters
it
could
not
much
affect
the
sum
of
solar
energies
whether
one
went
on
dancing
with
girls
in
washington
or
began
talking
to
boys
at
cambridge
the
good
people
who
thought
it
did
matter
had
a
sort
of
right
to
guide
one
could
not
reject
their
advice
still
less
disregard
their
wishes
the
sum
of
the
matter
was
that
henry
went
out
to
cambridge
and
had
a
few
words
with
president
eliot
which
seemed
to
him
almost
as
american
as
the
talk
about
diplomacy
with
his
father
ten
years
before
but
president
urged
adams
i
know
nothing
about
mediaeval
history
with
the
courteous
manner
and
bland
smile
so
familiar
for
the
next
generation
of
americans
eliot
mildly
but
firmly
replied
if
you
will
point
out
to
me
any
one
who
knows
more
adams
i
will
appoint
him
the
answer
was
neither
logical
nor
convincing
but
adams
could
not
meet
it
without
overstepping
his
privileges
he
could
not
say
that
under
the
circumstances
the
appointment
of
any
professor
at
all
seemed
to
him
unnecessary
so
at
hours
notice
he
broke
his
life
in
halves
again
in
order
to
begin
a
new
education
on
lines
he
had
not
chosen
in
subjects
for
which
he
cared
less
than
nothing
in
a
place
he
did
not
love
and
before
a
future
which
repelled
thousands
of
men
have
to
do
the
same
thing
but
his
case
was
peculiar
because
he
had
no
need
to
do
it
he
did
it
because
his
best
and
wisest
friends
urged
it
and
he
never
could
make
up
his
mind
whether
they
were
right
or
not
to
him
this
kind
of
education
was
always
false
for
himself
he
had
no
doubts
he
thought
it
a
mistake
but
his
opinion
did
not
prove
that
it
was
one
since
in
all
probability
whatever
he
did
would
be
more
or
less
a
mistake
he
had
reached
of
education
which
all
led
astray
what
he
could
gain
at
harvard
college
he
did
not
know
but
in
any
case
it
was
nothing
he
wanted
what
he
lost
at
washington
he
could
partly
see
but
in
any
case
it
was
not
fortune
grant
administration
wrecked
men
by
thousands
but
profited
few
perhaps
mr
fish
was
the
solitary
exception
one
might
search
the
whole
list
of
congress
judiciary
and
executive
during
the
years
to
and
find
little
but
damaged
reputation
the
period
was
poor
in
purpose
and
barren
in
results
henry
adams
if
not
the
rose
lived
as
near
it
as
any
politician
and
knew
more
or
less
all
the
men
in
any
way
prominent
at
washington
or
knew
all
about
them
among
them
in
his
opinion
the
best
equipped
the
most
and
most
industrious
was
abram
hewitt
who
sat
in
congress
for
a
dozen
years
between
and
sometimes
leading
the
house
and
always
wielding
influence
second
to
none
with
nobody
did
adams
form
closer
or
longer
relations
than
with
hewitt
whom
he
regarded
as
the
most
useful
public
man
in
washington
and
he
was
the
more
struck
by
hewitt
saying
at
the
end
of
his
laborious
career
as
legislator
that
he
left
behind
him
no
permanent
result
except
the
act
consolidating
the
surveys
adams
knew
no
other
man
who
had
done
so
much
unless
sherman
legislation
is
accepted
as
an
instance
of
success
hewitt
nearest
rival
would
probably
have
been
senator
pendleton
who
stood
father
to
civil
service
reform
in
an
attempt
to
correct
a
vice
that
should
never
have
been
allowed
to
be
born
these
were
the
men
who
succeeded
the
press
stood
in
much
the
same
light
no
editor
no
political
writer
and
no
public
administrator
achieved
enough
good
reputation
to
preserve
his
memory
for
twenty
years
a
number
of
them
achieved
bad
reputations
or
damaged
good
ones
that
had
been
gained
in
the
civil
war
on
the
whole
even
for
senators
diplomats
and
cabinet
officers
the
period
was
wearisome
and
stale
none
of
adams
generation
profited
by
public
activity
unless
it
were
william
whitney
and
even
he
could
not
be
induced
to
return
to
it
such
ambitions
as
these
were
out
of
one
reach
but
supposing
one
tried
for
what
was
feasible
attached
one
self
closely
to
the
garfields
arthurs
frelinghuysens
blaines
bayards
or
whitneys
who
happened
to
hold
office
and
supposing
one
asked
for
the
mission
to
belgium
or
portugal
and
obtained
it
supposing
one
served
a
term
as
assistant
secretary
or
chief
of
bureau
or
finally
supposing
one
had
gone
as
on
the
new
york
tribune
or
times
how
much
more
education
would
one
have
gained
than
by
going
to
harvard
college
these
questions
seemed
better
worth
an
answer
than
most
of
the
questions
on
examination
papers
at
college
or
in
the
civil
service
all
the
more
because
one
never
found
an
answer
to
them
then
or
afterwards
and
because
to
his
mind
the
value
of
american
society
altogether
was
mixed
up
with
the
value
of
washington
at
first
the
simple
beginner
struggling
with
principles
wanted
to
throw
off
responsibility
on
the
american
people
whose
bare
and
toiling
shoulders
had
to
carry
the
load
of
every
social
or
political
stupidity
but
the
american
people
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
with
the
customs
of
peking
american
character
might
perhaps
account
for
it
but
what
accounted
for
american
character
all
boston
all
new
england
and
all
respectable
new
york
including
charles
francis
adams
the
father
and
charles
francis
adams
the
son
agreed
that
washington
was
no
place
for
a
respectable
young
man
all
washington
including
presidents
cabinet
officers
judiciary
senators
congressmen
and
clerks
expressed
the
same
opinion
and
conspired
to
drive
away
every
young
man
who
happened
to
be
there
or
tried
to
approach
not
one
young
man
of
promise
remained
in
the
government
service
all
drifted
into
opposition
the
government
did
not
want
them
in
washington
case
was
perhaps
the
strongest
because
he
thought
he
had
done
well
he
was
forced
to
guess
it
since
he
knew
no
one
who
would
have
risked
so
extravagant
a
step
as
that
of
encouraging
a
young
man
in
a
literary
career
or
even
in
a
political
one
society
forbade
it
as
well
as
residence
in
a
political
capital
but
harvard
college
must
have
seen
some
hope
for
him
since
it
made
him
professor
against
his
will
even
the
publishers
and
editors
of
the
north
american
review
must
have
felt
a
certain
amount
of
confidence
in
him
since
they
put
the
review
in
his
hands
after
all
the
review
was
the
first
literary
power
in
america
even
though
it
paid
almost
as
little
in
gold
as
the
united
states
treasury
the
degree
of
harvard
college
might
bear
a
value
as
ephemeral
as
the
commission
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
but
the
government
of
the
college
measured
by
money
alone
and
patronage
was
a
matter
of
more
importance
than
that
of
some
branches
of
the
national
service
in
social
position
the
college
was
the
superior
of
them
all
put
together
in
knowledge
she
could
assert
no
superiority
since
the
government
made
no
claims
and
prided
itself
on
ignorance
the
service
of
harvard
college
was
distinctly
honorable
perhaps
the
most
honorable
in
america
and
if
harvard
college
thought
henry
adams
worth
employing
at
four
dollars
a
day
why
should
washington
decline
his
services
when
he
asked
nothing
why
should
he
be
dragged
from
a
career
he
liked
in
a
place
he
loved
into
a
career
he
detested
in
a
place
and
climate
he
shunned
was
it
enough
to
satisfy
him
that
all
america
should
call
washington
barren
and
dangerous
what
made
washington
more
dangerous
than
new
york
the
american
character
showed
singular
limitations
which
sometimes
drove
the
student
of
civilized
man
to
despair
crushed
by
his
own
ignorance
lost
in
the
darkness
of
his
own
gropings
the
scholar
finds
himself
jostled
of
a
sudden
by
a
crowd
of
men
who
seem
to
him
ignorant
that
there
is
a
thing
called
ignorance
who
have
forgotten
how
to
amuse
themselves
who
can
not
even
understand
that
they
are
bored
the
american
thought
of
himself
as
a
restless
pushing
energetic
ingenious
person
always
awake
and
trying
to
get
ahead
of
his
neighbors
perhaps
this
idea
of
the
national
character
might
be
correct
for
new
york
or
chicago
it
was
not
correct
for
washington
there
the
american
showed
himself
four
times
in
five
as
a
quiet
peaceful
shy
figure
rather
in
the
mould
of
abraham
lincoln
somewhat
sad
sometimes
pathetic
once
tragic
or
like
grant
inarticulate
uncertain
distrustful
of
himself
still
more
distrustful
of
others
and
awed
by
money
that
the
american
by
temperament
worked
to
excess
was
true
work
and
whiskey
were
his
stimulants
work
was
a
form
of
vice
but
he
never
cared
much
for
money
or
power
after
he
earned
them
the
amusement
of
the
pursuit
was
all
the
amusement
he

wanted

bored
patient
helpless
pathetically
dependent
on
his

indulgent

mostly
a

the

was
to

carefully
explaining
to
every
listener
that
the
happiest
day
of
his
life
would
be
the
day
he
should
land
on
the
pier
at

he
was
ashamed
to

his
mind
no
longer
answered
to
the
stimulus

he
could
not
face
a
new

all
his
immense
strength
his
intense
nervous
energy
his
keen
analytic
perceptions
were
oriented
in

the

failure
far
back
in
childhood
among
its
earliest
memories
henry
adams
could
recall
his
first
visit
to
harvard
college
he
must
have
been
nine
years
old
when
on
one
of
the
singularly
gloomy
winter
afternoons
which
beguiled
cambridgeport
his
mother
drove
him
out
to
visit
his
aunt
everett
edward
everett
was
then
president
of
the
college
and
lived
in
the
old
president
house
on
harvard
square
the
boy
remembered
the
on
the
left
of
the
hall
door
in
which
everett
received
them
he
remembered
a
marble
greyhound
in
the
corner
the
house
had
an
air
of
colonial
that
impressed
even
a
child
when
adams
closed
his
interview
with
president
eliot
he
asked
the
bursar
about
his
aunt
old
for
the
house
had
been
turned
to
base
uses
the
room
and
the
deserted
kitchen
adjacent
to
it
were
to
let

took
them
above
him
his
brother
brooks
then
a
law
student
had
rooms
with
a
private
staircase
opposite
was
dennett
a
young
instructor
almost
as
literary
as
adams
himself
and
more
rebellious
to
conventions
inquiry
revealed
a
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
also
supposed
to
be
superior
in
its
class
chauncey
wright
francis
wharton
dennett
john
fiske
or
their
equivalents
in
learning
and
lecture
were
seen
there
among
three
or
four
law
students
like
brooks
adams
with
these
primitive
arrangements
all
of
them
had
to
be
satisfied
the
standard
was
below
that
of
washington
but
it
was
for
the
moment
the
best
for
the
next
nine
months
the
assistant
professor
had
no
time
to
waste
on
comforts
or
amusements
he
exhausted
all
his
strength
in
trying
to
keep
one
day
ahead
of
his
duties
often
the
stint
ran
on
till
night
and
sleep
ran
short
he
could
not
stop
to
think
whether
he
were
doing
the
work
rightly
he
could
not
get
it
done
to
please
him
rightly
or
wrongly
for
he
never
could
satisfy
himself
what
to
do
the
fault
he
had
found
with
harvard
college
as
an
undergraduate
must
have
been
more
or
less
just
for
the
college
was
making
a
great
effort
to
meet
these
and
had
elected
president
eliot
in
to
carry
out
its
reforms
professor
gurney
was
one
of
the
leading
reformers
and
had
tried
his
hand
on
his
own
department
of
history
the
two
full
professors
of
history
torrey
and
gurney
charming
men
both
could
not
cover
the
ground
between
classical
courses
and
torrey
modern
ones
lay
a
gap
of
a
thousand
years
which
adams
was
expected
to
fill
the
students
had
already
elected
courses
numbered
and
without
knowing
what
was
to
be
taught
or
who
was
to
teach
if
their
new
professor
had
asked
what
idea
was
in
their
minds
they
must
have
replied
that
nothing
at
all
was
in
their
minds
since
their
professor
had
nothing
in
his
and
down
to
the
moment
he
took
his
chair
and
looked
his
scholars
in
the
face
he
had
given
as
far
as
he
could
remember
an
hour
more
or
less
to
the
middle
ages
not
that
his
ignorance
troubled
him
he
knew
enough
to
be
ignorant
his
course
had
led
him
through
oceans
of
ignorance
he
had
tumbled
from
one
ocean
into
another
till
he
had
learned
to
swim
but
even
to
him
education
was
a
serious
thing
a
parent
gives
life
but
as
parent
gives
no
more
a
murderer
takes
life
but
his
deed
stops
there
a
teacher
affects
eternity
he
can
never
tell
where
his
influence
stops
a
teacher
is
expected
to
teach
truth
and
may
perhaps
flatter
himself
that
he
does
so
if
he
stops
with
the
alphabet
or
the
multiplication
table
as
a
mother
teaches
truth
by
making
her
child
eat
with
a
spoon
but
morals
are
quite
another
truth
and
philosophy
is
more
complex
still
a
teacher
must
either
treat
history
as
a
catalogue
a
record
a
romance
or
as
an
evolution
and
whether
he
affirms
or
denies
evolution
he
falls
into
all
the
burning
faggots
of
the
pit
he
makes
of
his
scholars
either
priests
or
atheists
plutocrats
or
socialists
judges
or
anarchists
almost
in
spite
of
himself
in
essence
incoherent
and
immoral
history
had
either
to
be
taught
as
such
or
falsified
adams
wanted
to
do
neither
he
had
no
theory
of
evolution
to
teach
and
could
not
make
the
facts
fit
one
he
had
no
fancy
for
telling
agreeable
tales
to
amuse
boys
in
order
to
publish
them
afterwards
as
lectures
he
could
still
less
compel
his
students
to
learn
the
chronicle
and
the
venerable
bede
by
heart
he
saw
no
relation
whatever
between
his
students
and
the
middle
ages
unless
it
were
the
church
and
there
the
ground
was
particularly
dangerous
he
knew
better
than
though
he
were
a
professional
historian
that
the
man
who
should
solve
the
riddle
of
the
middle
ages
and
bring
them
into
the
line
of
evolution
from
past
to
present
would
be
a
greater
man
than
lamarck
or
linnaeus
but
history
had
nowhere
broken
down
so
pitiably
or
avowed
itself
so
hopelessly
bankrupt
as
there
since
gibbon
the
spectacle
was
almost
a
scandal
history
had
lost
even
the
sense
of
shame
it
was
a
hundred
years
behind
the
experimental
sciences
for
all
serious
purpose
it
was
less
instructive
than
walter
scott
and
alexandre
dumas
all
this
was
without
offence
to
sir
henry
maine
tyler
mclennan
buckle
auguste
comte
and
the
various
philosophers
who
from
time
to
time
stirred
the
scandal
and
made
it
more
scandalous
no
doubt
a
teacher
might
make
some
use
of
these
writers
or
their
theories
but
adams
could
fit
them
into
no
theory
of
his
own
the
college
expected
him
to
pass
at
least
half
his
time
teaching
the
boys
a
few
elementary
dates
and
relations
that
they
might
not
be
a
disgrace
to
the
university
this
was
formal
and
he
could
frankly
tell
the
boys
that
provided
they
passed
their
examinations
they
might
get
their
facts
where
they
liked
and
use
the
teacher
only
for
questions
the
only
privilege
a
student
had
that
was
worth
his
claiming
was
that
of
talking
to
the
professor
and
the
professor
was
bound
to
encourage
it
his
only
difficulty
on
that
side
was
to
get
them
to
talk
at
all
he
had
to
devise
schemes
to
find
what
they
were
thinking
about
and
induce
them
to
risk
criticism
from
their
fellows
any
large
body
of
students
stifles
the
student
no
man
can
instruct
more
than
students
at
once
the
whole
problem
of
education
is
one
of
its
cost
in
money
the
lecture
system
to
classes
of
hundreds
which
was
very
much
that
of
the
twelfth
century
suited
adams
not
at
all
barred
from
philosophy
and
bored
by
facts
he
wanted
to
teach
his
students
something
not
wholly
useless
the
number
of
students
whose
minds
were
of
an
order
above
the
average
was
in
his
experience
barely
one
in
ten
the
rest
could
not
be
much
stimulated
by
any
inducements
a
teacher
could
suggest
all
were
respectable
and
in
seven
years
of
contact
adams
never
had
cause
to
complain
of
one
but
nine
minds
in
ten
take
polish
passively
like
a
hard
surface
only
the
tenth
sensibly
reacts
adams
thought
that
as
no
one
seemed
to
care
what
he
did
he
would
try
to
cultivate
this
tenth
mind
though
necessarily
at
the
expense
of
the
other
nine
he
frankly
acted
on
the
rule
that
a
teacher
who
knew
nothing
of
his
subject
should
not
pretend
to
teach
his
scholars
what
he
did
not
know
but
should
join
them
in
trying
to
find
the
best
way
of
learning
it
the
rather
pretentious
name
of
historical
method
was
sometimes
given
to
this
process
of
instruction
but
the
name
smacked
of
german
pedagogy
and
a
young
professor
who
respected
neither
history
nor
method
and
whose
sole
object
of
interest
was
his
minds
fell
into
trouble
enough
without
adding
to
it
a
german
parentage
the
task
was
doomed
to
failure
for
a
reason
which
he
could
not
control
nothing
is
easier
than
to
teach
historical
method
but
when
learned
it
has
little
use
history
is
a
tangled
skein
that
one
may
take
up
at
any
point
and
break
when
one
has
unravelled
enough
but
complexity
precedes
evolution
the
pteraspis
grins
horribly
from
the
closed
entrance
one
may
not
begin
at
the
beginning
and
one
has
but
the
loosest
relative
truths
to
follow
up
adams
found
himself
obliged
to
force
his
material
into
some
shape
to
which
a
method
could
be
applied
he
could
think
only
of
law
as
subject
the
law
school
as
end
and
he
took
as
victims
of
his
experiment
highly
intelligent
young
men
who
seemed
willing
to
work
the
course
began
with
the
beginning
as
far
as
the
books
showed
a
beginning
in
primitive
man
and
came
down
through
the
salic
franks
to
the
norman
english
since
no
textbooks
existed
the
professor
refused
to
profess
knowing
no
more
than
his
students
and
the
students
read
what
they
pleased
and
compared
their
results
as
pedagogy
nothing
could
be
more
triumphant
the
boys
worked
like
rabbits
and
dug
holes
all
over
the
field
of
archaic
society
no
difficulty
stopped
them
unknown
languages
yielded
before
their
attack
and
customary
law
became
familiar
as
the
police
court
undoubtedly
they
learned
after
a
fashion
to
chase
an
idea
like
a
hare
through
as
dense
a
thicket
of
obscure
facts
as
they
were
likely
to
meet
at
the
bar
but
their
teacher
knew
from
his
own
experience
that
his
wonderful
method
led
nowhere
and
they
would
have
to
exert
themselves
to
get
rid
of
it
in
the
law
school
even
more
than
they
exerted
themselves
to
acquire
it
in
the
college
their
science
had
no
system
and
could
have
none
since
its
subject
was
merely
antiquarian
try
as
hard
as
he
might
the
professor
could
not
make
it
actual
what
was
the
use
of
training
an
active
mind
to
waste
its
energy
the
experiments
might
in
time
train
adams
as
a
professor
but
this
result
was
still
less
to
his
taste
he
wanted
to
help
the
boys
to
a
career
but
not
one
of
his
many
devices
to
stimulate
the
intellectual
reaction
of
the
student
mind
satisfied
either
him
or
the
students
for
himself
he
was
clear
that
the
fault
lay
in
the
system
which
could
lead
only
to
inertia
such
little
knowledge
of
himself
as
he
possessed
warranted
him
in
affirming
that
his
mind
required
conflict
competition
contradiction
even
more
than
that
of
the
student
he
too
wanted
a
to
set
his
name
upon
his
reform
of
the
system
would
have
begun
in
the
at
his
own
desk
he
would
have
seated
a
rival
assistant
professor
opposite
him
whose
business
should
be
strictly
limited
to
expressing
opposite
views
nothing
short
of
this
would
ever
interest
either
the
professor
or
the
student
but
of
all
university
freaks
no
irregularity
shocked
the
intellectual
atmosphere
so
much
as
contradiction
or
competition
between
teachers
in
that
respect
the
university
system
was
worth
the
whole
teaching
of
the
modern
school
all
his
pretty
efforts
to
create
conflicts
of
thought
among
his
students
failed
for
want
of
system
none
met
the
needs
of
instruction
in
spite
of
president
eliot
reforms
and
his
steady
generous
liberal
support
the
system
remained
costly
clumsy
and
futile
the
university
as
far
as
it
was
represented
by
henry
adams
produced
at
great
waste
of
time
and
money
results
not
worth
reaching
he
made
use
of
his
lost
two
years
of
german
schooling
to
inflict
their
results
on
his
students
and
by
a
happy
chance
he
was
in
the
full
tide
of
fashion
the
germans
were
crowning
their
new
emperor
at
versailles
and
surrounding
his
head
with
a
halo
of
pepins
and
merwigs
othos
and
barbarossas
james
bryce
had
even
discovered
the
holy
roman
empire
germany
was
never
so
powerful
and
the
assistant
professor
of
history
had
nothing
else
as
his
stock
in
trade
he
imposed
germany
on
his
scholars
with
a
heavy
hand
he
was
rejoiced
but
he
sometimes
doubted
whether
they
should
be
grateful
on
the
whole
he
was
content
neither
with
what
he
had
taught
nor
with
the
way
he
had
taught
it
the
seven
years
he
passed
in
teaching
seemed
to
him
lost
the
uses
of
adversity
are
beyond
measure
strange
as
a
professor
he
regarded
himself
as
a
failure
without
false
modesty
he
thought
he
knew
what
he
meant
he
had
tried
a
great
many
experiments
and
wholly
succeeded
in
none
he
had
succumbed
to
the
weight
of
the
system
he
had
accomplished
nothing
that
he
tried
to
do
he
regarded
the
system
as
wrong
more
mischievous
to
the
teachers
than
to
the
students
fallacious
from
the
beginning
to
end
he
quitted
the
university
at
last
in
with
a
feeling
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
invariable
courtesy
and
kindness
shown
by
every
one
in
it
from
the
president
to
the
injured
students
he
should
be
sore
at
his
failure
these
were
his
own
feelings
but
they
seemed
not
to
be
felt
in
the
college
with
the
same
perplexing
impartiality
that
had
so
much
disconcerted
him
in
his
undergraduate
days
the
college
insisted
on
expressing
an
opposite
view
john
fiske
went
so
far
in
his
notice
of
the
family
in
appleton
cyclopedia
as
to
say
that
henry
had
left
a
great
reputation
at
harvard
college
which
was
a
proof
of
john
personal
regard
that
adams
heartily
returned
and
set
the
kind
expression
down
to
camaraderie
the
case
was
different
when
president
eliot
himself
hinted
that
adams
services
merited
recognition
adams
could
have
wept
on
his
shoulder
in
hysterics
so
grateful
was
he
for
the
rare
that
inspired
the
compliment
but
he
could
not
allow
the
college
to
think
that
he
esteemed
himself
entitled
to
distinction
he
knew
better
and
his
was
among
the
failures
which
were
respectable
enough
to
deserve
yet
nothing
in
the
vanity
of
life
struck
him
as
more
humiliating
than
that
harvard
college
which
he
had
persistently
criticised
abused
abandoned
and
neglected
should
alone
have
offered
him
a
dollar
an
office
an
encouragement
or
a
kindness
harvard
college
might
have
its
faults
but
at
least
it
redeemed
america
since
it
was
true
to
its
own
the
only
part
of
education
that
the
professor
thought
a
success
was
the
students
he
found
them
excellent
company
cast
more
or
less
in
the
same
mould
without
violent
emotions
or
sentiment
and
except
for
the
veneer
of
american
habits
ignorant
of
all
that
man
had
ever
thought
or
hoped
their
minds
burst
open
like
flowers
at
the
sunlight
of
a
suggestion
they
were
quick
to
respond
plastic
to
a
mould
and
incapable
of
fatigue
their
faith
in
education
was
so
full
of
pathos
that
one
dared
not
ask
them
what
they
thought
they
could
do
with
education
when
they
got
it
adams
did
put
the
question
to
one
of
them
and
was
surprised
at
the
answer
the
degree
of
harvard
college
is
worth
money
to
me
in
chicago
this
reply
upset
his
experience
for
the
degree
of
harvard
college
had
been
rather
a
drawback
to
a
young
man
in
boston
and
washington
so
far
as
it
went
the
answer
was
good
and
settled
one
doubts
adams
knew
no
better
although
he
had
given
twenty
years
to
pursuing
the
same
education
and
was
no
nearer
a
result
than
they
he
still
had
to
take
for
granted
many
things
that
they
need
not
among
the
rest
that
his
teaching
did
them
more
good
than
harm
in
his
own
opinion
the
greatest
good
he
could
do
them
was
to
hold
his
tongue
they
needed
much
faith
then
they
were
likely
to
need
more
if
they
lived
long
he
never
knew
whether
his
colleagues
shared
his
doubts
about
their
own
utility
unlike
himself
they
knew
more
or
less
their
business
he
could
not
tell
his
scholars
that
history
glowed
with
social
virtue
the
professor
of
chemistry
cared
not
a
chemical
atom
whether
society
was
virtuous
or
not
adams
could
not
pretend
that
mediaeval
society
proved
evolution
the
professor
of
physics
smiled
at
evolution
adams
was
glad
to
dwell
on
the
virtues
of
the
church
and
the
triumphs
of
its
art
the
professor
of
political
economy
had
to
treat
them
as
waste
of
force
they
knew
what
they
had
to
teach
he
did
not
they
might
perhaps
be
frauds
without
knowing
it
but
he
knew
certainly
nothing
else
of
himself
he
could
teach
his
students
nothing
he
was
only
educating
himself
at
their
cost
education
like
politics
is
a
rough
affair
and
every
instructor
has
to
shut
his
eyes
and
hold
his
tongue
as
though
he
were
a
priest
the
students
alone
satisfied
they
thought
they
gained
something
perhaps
they
did
for
even
in
america
and
in
the
twentieth
century
life
could
not
be
wholly
industrial
adams
fervently
hoped
that
they
might
remain
content
but
supposing
twenty
years
more
to
pass
and
they
should
turn
on
him
as
fiercely
as
he
had
turned
on
his
old
instructors
what
answer
could
he
make
the
college
had
pleaded
guilty
and
tried
to
reform
he
had
pleaded
guilty
from
the
start
and
his
reforms
had
failed
before
those
of
the
college
the
was
futile
enough
but
the
was
worse
american
society
feared
total
wreck
in
the
maelstrom
of
political
and
corporate
administration
but
it
could
not
look
for
help
to
college
dons
adams
knew
in
that
capacity
both
congressmen
and
professors
and
he
preferred
congressmen
the
same
failure
marked
the
society
of
a
college
several
score
of
the
most
agreeable
and
personally
the
most
sociable
people
in
america
united
in
cambridge
to
make
a
social
desert
that
would
have
starved
a
polar
bear
the
liveliest
and
most
agreeable
of
men
james
russell
lowell
francis
j
child
louis
agassiz
his
son
alexander
gurney
john
fiske
william
james
and
a
dozen
others
who
would
have
made
the
joy
of
london
or
paris
tried
their
best
to
break
out
and
be
like
other
men
in
cambridge
and
boston
but
society
called
them
professors
and
professors
they
had
to
be
while
all
these
brilliant
men
were
greedy
for
companionship
all
were
famished
for
want
of
it
society
was
a
without
business
the
elements
were
there
but
society
can
not
be
made
up
of
elements
people
who
are
expected
to
be
silent
unless
they
have
observations
to
make
and
all
the
elements
are
bound
to
remain
apart
if
required
to
make
observations
thus
it
turned
out
that
of
all
his
many
educations
adams
thought
that
of
the
thinnest
yet
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
the
education
of
an
editor
in
some
ways
was
thinner
still
the
editor
had
barely
time
to
edit
he
had
none
to
write
if
copy
fell
short
he
was
obliged
to
scribble
a
on
the
virtues
of
the
or
the
vices
of
the
popes
for
he
knew
more
about
edward
the
confessor
or
boniface
viii
than
he
did
about
president
grant
for
seven
years
he
wrote
nothing
the
review
lived
on
his
brother
railway
articles
the
editor
could
help
others
but
could
do
nothing
for
himself
as
a
writer
he
was
totally
forgotten
by
the
time
he
had
been
an
editor
for
twelve
months
as
editor
he
could
find
no
writer
to
take
his
place
for
politics
and
affairs
of
current
concern
the
review
became
chiefly
historical
russell
lowell
and
frank
palgrave
helped
him
to
keep
it
literary
the
editor
was
a
helpless
drudge
whose
successes
if
he
made
any
belonged
to
his
writers
but
whose
failures
might
easily
bankrupt
himself
such
a
review
may
be
made
a
sink
of
money
with
captivating
ease
the
secrets
of
success
as
an
editor
were
easily
learned
the
highest
was
that
of
getting
advertisements
ten
pages
of
advertising
made
an
editor
a
success
five
marked
him
as
a
failure
the
merits
or
demerits
of
his
literature
had
little
to
do
with
his
results
except
when
they
led
to
adversity
a
year
or
two
of
education
as
editor
satiated
most
of
his
appetite
for
that
career
as
a
profession
after
a
very
slight
experience
he
said
no
more
on
the
subject
he
felt
willing
to
let
any
one
edit
if
he
himself
might
write
vulgarly
speaking
it
was
a
life
when
it
did
not
succeed
and
little
better
when
it
did
a
professor
had
at
least
the
pleasure
of
associating
with
his
students
an
editor
lived
the
life
of
an
owl
a
professor
commonly
became
a
pedagogue
or
a
pedant
an
editor
became
an
authority
on
advertising
on
the
whole
adams
preferred
his
attic
in
washington
he
was
educated
enough
ignorance
paid
better
for
at
least
it
earned
fifty
dollars
a
month
with
this
result
henry
adams
education
at
his
entry
into
life
stopped
and
his
life
began
he
had
to
take
that
life
as
he
best
could
with
such
accidental
education
as
luck
had
given
him
but
he
held
that
it
was
wrong
and
that
if
he
were
to
begin
again
he
would
do
it
on
a
better
system
he
thought
he
knew
nearly
what
system
to
pursue
at
that
time
alexander
agassiz
had
not
yet
got
his
head
above
water
so
far
as
to
serve
for
a
model
as
he
did
twenty
or
thirty
years
afterwards
but
the
editorship
of
the
north
american
review
had
one
solitary
merit
it
made
the
editor
acquainted
at
a
distance
with
almost
every
one
in
the
country
who
could
write
or
who
could
be
the
cause
of
writing
adams
was
vastly
pleased
to
be
received
among
these
clever
people
as
one
of
themselves
and
felt
always
a
little
surprised
at
their
treating
him
as
an
equal
for
they
all
had
education
but
among
them
only
one
stood
out
in
extraordinary
prominence
as
the
type
and
model
of
what
adams
would
have
liked
to
be
and
of
what
the
american
as
he
conceived
should
have
been
and
was
not
thanks
to
the
article
on
sir
charles
lyell
adams
passed
for
a
friend
of
geologists
and
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
mattered
much
less
to
them
than
the
extent
of
his
friendship
for
geologists
were
as
a
class
not
much
better
off
than
himself
and
friends
were
sorely
few
one
of
his
friends
from
earliest
childhood
and
nearest
neighbor
in
quincy
frank
emmons
had
become
a
geologist
and
joined
the
fortieth
parallel
survey
under
government
at
washington
in
the
winter
of
emmons
had
invited
adams
to
go
out
with
him
on
one
of
the
in
summer
of
course
when
adams
took
the
review
he
put
it
at
the
service
of
the
survey
and
regretted
only
that
he
could
not
do
more
when
the
first
year
of
professing
and
editing
was
at
last
over
and
his
july
north
american
appeared
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
took
the
next
train
for
the
west
of
his
year
work
he
was
no
judge
he
had
become
a
small
spring
in
a
large
mechanism
and
his
work
counted
only
in
the
sum
but
he
had
been
treated
civilly
by
everybody
and
he
felt
at
home
even
in
boston
putting
in
his
pocket
the
july
number
of
the
north
american
with
a
notice
of
the
fortieth
parallel
survey
by
professor
whitney
he
started
for
the
plains
and
the
rocky
mountains
in
the
year
the
west
was
still
fresh
and
the
union
pacific
was
young
beyond
the
missouri
river
one
felt
the
atmosphere
of
indians
and
buffaloes
one
saw
the
last
vestiges
of
an
old
education
worth
studying
if
one
would
but
it
was
not
that
which
adams
sought
rather
he
came
out
to
spy
upon
the
land
of
the
future
the
survey
occasionally
borrowed
troopers
from
the
nearest
station
in
case
of
happening
on
hostile
indians
but
otherwise
the
topographers
and
geologists
thought
more
about
minerals
than
about
sioux
they
held
under
their
hammers
a
thousand
miles
of
mineral
country
with
all
its
riddles
to
solve
and
its
stores
of
possible
wealth
to
mark
they
felt
the
future
in
their
hands
emmons
party
was
out
of
reach
in
the
uintahs
but
arnold
hague
had
come
in
to
laramie
for
supplies
and
they
took
charge
of
adams
for
a
time
their
wanderings
or
adventures
matter
nothing
to
the
story
of
education
they
were
all
hardened
mountaineers
and
surveyors
who
took
everything
for
granted
and
spared
each
other
the
most
wearisome
bore
of
english
and
scotch
life
the
stories
of
the
big
game
they
killed
a
bear
was
an
occasional
amusement
a
wapiti
was
a
constant
necessity
but
the
only
wild
animal
dangerous
to
man
was
a
rattlesnake
or
a
skunk
one
shot
for
amusement
but
one
had
other
matters
to
talk
about
adams
enjoyed
killing
big
game
but
loathed
the
labor
of
cutting
it
up
so
that
he
rarely
unslung
the
little
carbine
he
was
in
a
manner
required
to
carry
on
the
other
hand
he
liked
to
wander
off
alone
on
his
mule
and
pass
the
day
fishing
a
mountain
stream
or
exploring
a
valley
one
morning
when
the
party
was
camped
high
above
estes
park
on
the
flank
of
long
peak
he
borrowed
a
rod
and
rode
down
over
a
rough
trail
into
estes
park
for
some
trout
the
day
was
fine
and
hazy
with
the
smoke
of
forest
fires
a
thousand
miles
away
the
park
stretched
its
english
beauties
off
to
the
base
of
its
bordering
mountains
in
natural
landscape
and
archaic
peace
the
stream
was
just
fishy
enough
to
tempt
lingering
along
its
banks
hour
after
hour
the
sun
moved
westward
and
the
fish
moved
eastward
or
disappeared
altogether
until
at
last
when
the
fisherman
cinched
his
mule
sunset
was
nearer
than
he
thought
darkness
caught
him
before
he
could
catch
his
trail
not
caring
to
tumble
into
some
hole
he
allowed
he
was
lost
and
turned
back
in
he
was
out
of
the
hills
and
under
the
stars
of
estes
park
but
he
saw
no
prospect
of
supper
or
of
bed
estes
park
was
large
enough
to
serve
for
a
bed
on
a
summer
night
for
an
army
of
professors
but
the
supper
question
offered
difficulties
there
was
but
one
cabin
in
the
park
near
its
entrance
and
he
felt
no
great
confidence
in
finding
it
but
he
thought
his
mule
cleverer
than
himself
and
the
dim
lines
of
mountain
crest
against
the
stars
fenced
his
range
of
error
the
patient
mule
plodded
on
without
other
road
than
the
gentle
slope
of
the
ground
and
some
two
hours
must
have
passed
before
a
light
showed
in
the
distance
as
the
mule
came
up
to
the
cabin
door
two
or
three
men
came
out
to
see
the
stranger
one
of
these
men
was
clarence
king
on
his
way
up
to
the
camp
adams
fell
into
his
arms
as
with
most
friendships
it
was
never
a
matter
of
growth
or
doubt
friends
are
born
in
archaic
horizons
they
were
shaped
with
the
pteraspis
in
siluria
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
accident
of
space
king
had
come
up
that
day
from
greeley
in
a
light
buggy
over
a
trail
hardly
fit
for
a
commissariat
mule
as
adams
had
reason
to
know
since
he
went
back
in
the
buggy
in
the
cabin
luxury
provided
a
room
and
one
bed
for
guests
they
shared
the
room
and
the
bed
and
talked
till
far
towards
dawn
king
had
everything
to
interest
and
delight
adams
he
knew
more
than
adams
did
of
art
and
poetry
he
knew
america
especially
west
of
the
hundredth
meridian
better
than
any
one
he
knew
the
professor
by
heart
and
he
knew
the
congressman
better
than
he
did
the
professor
he
knew
even
women
even
the
american
woman
even
the
new
york
woman
which
is
saying
much
incidentally
he
knew
more
practical
geology
than
was
good
for
him
and
saw
ahead
at
least
one
generation
further
than
the
that
he
saw
right
was
a
different
matter
since
the
beginning
of
time
no
man
has
lived
who
is
known
to
have
seen
right
the
charm
of
king
was
that
he
saw
what
others
did
and
a
great
deal
more
his
wit
and
humor
his
bubbling
energy
which
swept
every
one
into
the
current
of
his
interest
his
personal
charm
of
youth
and
manners
his
faculty
of
giving
and
taking
profusely
lavishly
whether
in
thought
or
in
money
as
though
he
were
nature
herself
marked
him
almost
alone
among
americans
he
had
in
him
something
of
the
greek
a
touch
of
alcibiades
or
alexander
one
clarence
king
only
existed
in
the
world
a
new
friend
is
always
a
miracle
but
at
years
old
such
a
bird
of
paradise
rising
in
the
was
an
avatar
one
friend
in
a
lifetime
is
much
two
are
many
three
are
hardly
possible
friendship
needs
a
certain
parallelism
of
life
a
community
of
thought
a
rivalry
of
aim
king
like
adams
and
all
their
generation
was
at
that
moment
passing
the
critical
point
of
his
career
the
one
coming
from
the
west
saturated
with
the
sunshine
of
the
sierras
met
the
other
drifting
from
the
east
drenched
in
the
fogs
of
london
and
both
had
the
same
problems
to
handle
the
same
stock
of
implements
the
same
field
to
work
in
above
all
the
same
obstacles
to
overcome
as
a
companion
king
charm
was
great
but
this
was
not
the
quality
that
so
much
attracted
adams
nor
could
he
affect
even
distant
rivalry
on
this
ground
adams
could
never
tell
a
story
chiefly
because
he
always
forgot
it
and
he
was
never
guilty
of
a
witticism
unless
by
accident
king
and
the
fortieth
parallel
influenced
him
in
a
way
far
more
vital
the
lines
of
their
lives
converged
but
king
had
moulded
and
directed
his
life
logically
scientifically
as
adams
thought
american
life
should
be
directed
he
had
given
himself
education
all
of
a
piece
yet
broad
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
career
where
their
paths
at
last
came
together
he
could
look
back
and
look
forward
on
a
straight
line
with
scientific
knowledge
for
its
base
adams
life
past
or
future
was
a
succession
of
violent
breaks
or
waves
with
no
base
at
all
king
abnormal
energy
had
already
won
him
great
success
none
of
his
contemporaries
had
done
so
much
or
were
likely
to
leave
so
deep
a
trail
he
had
managed
to
induce
congress
to
adopt
almost
its
first
modern
act
of
legislation
he
had
organized
as
a
civil
not
military
measure
a
government
survey
he
had
paralleled
the
continental
railway
in
geology
a
feat
as
yet
unequalled
by
other
governments
which
had
as
a
rule
no
continents
to
survey
he
was
creating
one
of
the
classic
scientific
works
of
the
century
the
chances
were
great
that
he
could
whenever
he
chose
to
quit
the
government
service
take
the
pick
of
the
gold
and
silver
copper
or
coal
and
build
up
his
fortune
as
he
pleased
whatever
prize
he
wanted
lay
ready
for
him
scientific
social
literary
political
and
he
knew
how
to
take
them
in
turn
with
ordinary
luck
he
would
die
at
eighty
the
richest
and
most
genius
of
his
day
so
little
egoistic
he
was
that
none
of
his
friends
felt
envy
of
his
extraordinary
superiority
but
rather
grovelled
before
it
so
that
women
were
jealous
of
the
power
he
had
over
men
but
women
were
many
and
kings
were
one
the
men
worshipped
not
so
much
their
friend
as
the
ideal
american
they
all
wanted
to
be
the
women
were
jealous
because
at
heart
king
had
no
faith
in
the
american
woman
he
loved
types
more
robust
the
young
men
of
the
fortieth
parallel
had
californian
instincts
they
were
brothers
of
bret
harte
they
felt
no
leanings
towards
the
simple
uniformities
of
lyell
and
darwin
they
saw
little
proof
of
slight
and
imperceptible
changes
to
them
catastrophe
was
the
law
of
change
they
cared
little
for
simplicity
and
much
for
complexity
but
it
was
the
complexity
of
nature
not
of
new
york
or
even
of
the
mississippi
valley
king
loved
paradox
he
started
them
like
rabbits
and
cared
for
them
no
longer
when
caught
or
lost
but
they
delighted
adams
for
they
helped
among
other
things
to
persuade
him
that
history
was
more
amusing
than
science
the
only
question
left
open
to
doubt
was
their
relative
money
value
in
emmons
camp
far
up
in
the
uintahs
these
talks
were
continued
till
the
frosts
became
sharp
in
the
mountains
history
and
science
spread
out
in
personal
horizons
towards
goals
no
longer
far
away
no
more
education
was
possible
for
either
man
such
as
they
were
they
had
got
to
stand
the
chances
of
the
world
they
lived
in
and
when
adams
started
back
to
cambridge
to
take
up
again
the
humble
tasks
of
schoolmaster
and
editor
he
was
harnessed
to
his
cart
education
systematic
or
accidental
had
done
its
worst
henceforth
he
went
on
submissive
chapter
xxi
twenty
years
after
once
more
this
is
a
story
of
education
not
of
adventure
it
is
meant
to
help
young
men
or
such
as
have
intelligence
enough
to
seek
help
but
it
is
not
meant
to
amuse
them
what
one
did
or
did
not
do
with
one
education
after
getting
it
need
trouble
the
inquirer
in
no
way
it
is
a
personal
matter
only
which
would
confuse
him
perhaps
henry
adams
was
not
worth
educating
most
keen
judges
incline
to
think
that
barely
one
man
in
a
hundred
owns
a
mind
capable
of
reacting
to
any
purpose
on
the
forces
that
surround
him
and
fully
half
of
these
react
wrongly
the
object
of
education
for
that
mind
should
be
the
teaching
itself
how
to
react
with
vigor
and
economy
no
doubt
the
world
at
large
will
always
lag
so
far
behind
the
active
mind
as
to
make
a
soft
cushion
of
inertia
to
drop
upon
as
it
did
for
henry
adams
but
education
should
try
to
lessen
the
obstacles
diminish
the
friction
invigorate
the
energy
and
should
train
minds
to
react
not
at
haphazard
but
by
choice
on
the
lines
of
force
that
attract
their
world
what
one
knows
is
in
youth
of
little
moment
they
know
enough
who
know
how
to
learn
throughout
human
history
the
waste
of
mind
has
been
appalling
and
as
this
story
is
meant
to
show
society
has
conspired
to
promote
it
no
doubt
the
teacher
is
the
worst
criminal
but
the
world
stands
behind
him
and
drags
the
student
from
his
course
the
moral
is
stentorian
only
the
most
energetic
the
most
highly
fitted
and
the
most
favored
have
overcome
the
friction
or
the
viscosity
of
inertia
and
these
were
compelled
to
waste
of
their
energy
in
doing
it
fit
or
unfit
henry
adams
stopped
his
own
education
in
and
began
to
apply
it
for
practical
uses
like
his
neighbors
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
he
found
that
he
had
finished
and
could
sum
up
the
result
he
had
no
complaint
to
make
against
man
or
woman
they
had
all
treated
him
kindly
he
had
never
met
with
or
even
or
known
a
quarrel
he
had
never
seen
serious
dishonesty
or
ingratitude
he
had
found
a
readiness
in
the
young
to
respond
to
suggestion
that
seemed
to
him
far
beyond
all
he
had
reason
to
expect
considering
the
stock
complaints
against
the
world
he
could
not
understand
why
he
had
nothing
to
complain
of
during
these
twenty
years
he
had
done
as
much
work
in
quantity
as
his
neighbors
wanted
more
than
they
would
ever
stop
to
look
at
and
more
than
his
share
merely
in
print
he
thought
altogether
ridiculous
the
number
of
volumes
he
counted
on
the
shelves
of
public
libraries
he
had
no
notion
whether
they
served
a
useful
purpose
he
had
worked
in
the
dark
but
so
had
most
of
his
friends
even
the
artists
none
of
whom
held
any
lofty
opinion
of
their
success
in
raising
the
standards
of
society
or
felt
profound
respect
for
the
methods
or
manners
of
their
time
at
home
or
abroad
but
all
of
whom
had
tried
in
a
way
to
hold
the
standard
up
the
effort
had
been
for
the
older
generation
exhausting
as
one
could
see
in
the
hunts
but
the
generation
after
made
more
figure
not
in
proportion
to
public
wealth
or
in
the
census
but
in
their
own
a
fair
number
of
the
men
who
were
born
in
the
thirties
had
won
names
phillips
brooks
bret
harte
henry
james
richardson
john
la
farge
and
the
list
might
be
made
fairly
long
if
it
were
worth
while
but
from
their
school
had
sprung
others
like
augustus
gaudens
mckim
stanford
white
and
scores
born
in
the
forties
who
counted
as
force
even
in
the
mental
inertia
of
sixty
or
eighty
million
people
among
all
these
clarence
king
john
hay
and
henry
adams
had
led
modest
existences
trying
to
fill
in
the
social
gaps
of
a
class
which
as
yet
showed
but
thin
ranks
and
little
cohesion
the
combination
offered
no
very
glittering
prizes
but
they
pursued
it
for
twenty
years
with
as
much
patience
and
effort
as
though
it
led
to
fame
or
power
until
at
last
henry
adams
thought
his
own
duties
sufficiently
performed
and
his
account
with
society
settled
he
had
enjoyed
his
life
amazingly
and
would
not
have
exchanged
it
for
any
other
that
came
in
his
way
he
was
or
thought
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
it
but
for
reasons
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
education
he
was
tired
his
nervous
energy
ran
low
and
like
a
horse
that
wears
out
he
quitted
the
left
the
stable
and
sought
pastures
as
far
as
possible
from
the
old
education
had
ended
in
life
was
complete
in
the
rest
mattered
so
little
as
had
happened
so
often
he
found
himself
in
london
when
the
question
of
return
imposed
its
verdict
on
him
after
much
fruitless
effort
to
rest
elsewhere
the
time
was
the
month
of
january
he
was
alone
in
hospital
in
the
gloom
of
midwinter
he
was
close
on
his
birthday
and
pall
mall
had
forgotten
him
as
completely
as
it
had
forgotten
his
elders
he
had
not
seen
london
for
a
dozen
years
and
was
rather
amused
to
have
only
a
bed
for
a
world
and
a
familiar
black
fog
for
horizon
the
smelt
homelike
the
fog
had
a
fruity
taste
of
youth
anything
was
better
than
being
turned
out
into
the
wastes
of
wigmore
street
he
could
always
amuse
himself
by
living
over
his
youth
and
driving
once
more
down
oxford
street
in
with
life
before
him
to
imagine
far
less
amusing
than
it
had
turned
out
to
be
the
future
attracted
him
less
lying
there
for
a
week
he
reflected
on
what
he
could
do
next
he
had
just
come
up
from
the
south
seas
with
john
la
farge
who
had
reluctantly
crawled
away
towards
new
york
to
resume
the
grinding
routine
of
at
an
age
when
life
runs
low
adams
would
rather
as
choice
have
gone
back
to
the
east
if
it
were
only
to
sleep
forever
in
the
under
the
southern
stars
wandering
over
the
dark
purple
ocean
with
its
purple
sense
of
solitude
and
void
not
that
he
liked
the
sensation
but
that
it
was
the
most
unearthly
he
had
felt
he
had
not
yet
happened
on
rudyard
kipling
mandalay
but
he
knew
the
poetry
before
he
knew
the
poem
like
millions
of
wanderers
who
have
perhaps
alone
felt
the
world
exactly
as
it
is
nothing
attracted
him
less
than
the
idea
of
beginning
a
new
education
the
old
one
had
been
poor
enough
any
new
one
could
only
add
to
its
faults
life
had
been
cut
in
halves
and
the
old
half
had
passed
away
education
and
all
leaving
no
stock
to
graft
on
the
new
world
he
faced
in
paris
and
london
seemed
to
him
fantastic
willing
to
admit
it
real
in
the
sense
of
having
some
kind
of
existence
outside
his
own
mind
he
could
not
admit
it
reasonable
in
paris
his
heart
sank
to
mere
pulp
before
the
dismal
ballets
at
the
grand
opera
and
the
eternal
vaudeville
at
the
old
palais
royal
but
except
for
them
his
own
paris
of
the
second
empire
was
as
extinct
as
that
of
the
first
napoleon
at
the
galleries
and
exhibitions
he
was
racked
by
the
effort
of
art
to
be
original
and
when
one
day
after
much
reflection
john
la
farge
asked
whether
there
might
not
still
be
room
for
something
simple
in
art
adams
shook
his
head
as
he
saw
the
world
it
was
no
longer
simple
and
could
not
express
itself
simply
it
should
express
what
it
was
and
this
was
something
that
neither
adams
nor
la
farge
understood
under
the
first
blast
of
this
the
lights
seemed
fairly
to
go
out
he
felt
nothing
in
common
with
the
world
as
it
promised
to
be
he
was
ready
to
quit
it
and
the
easiest
path
led
back
to
the
east
but
he
could
not
venture
alone
and
the
rarest
of
animals
is
a
companion
he
must
return
to
america
to
get
one
perhaps
while
waiting
he
might
write
more
history
and
on
the
chance
as
a
last
resource
he
gave
orders
for
copying
everything
he
could
reach
in
archives
but
this
was
mere
habit
he
went
home
as
a
horse
goes
back
to
his
stable
because
he
knew
nowhere
else
to
go
home
was
washington
as
soon
as
grant
administration
ended
in
and
evarts
became
secretary
of
state
adams
went
back
there
partly
to
write
history
but
chiefly
because
his
seven
years
of
laborious
banishment
in
boston
convinced
him
that
as
far
as
he
had
a
function
in
life
it
was
as
to
statesmen
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
at
about
the
same
time
old
george
bancroft
did
the
same
thing
and
presently
john
hay
came
on
to
be
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
evarts
and
stayed
there
to
write
the
life
of
lincoln
in
adams
joined
him
in
employing
richardson
to
build
them
adjoining
houses
on
la
fayette
square
as
far
as
adams
had
a
home
this
was
it
to
the
house
on
la
fayette
square
he
must
turn
for
he
had
no
other
status
no
position
in
the
world
never
did
he
make
a
decision
more
reluctantly
than
this
of
going
back
to
his
manger
his
father
and
mother
were
dead
all
his
family
led
settled
lives
of
their
own
except
for
two
or
three
friends
in
washington
who
were
themselves
uncertain
of
stay
no
one
cared
whether
he
came
or
went
and
he
cared
least
there
was
nothing
to
care
about
every
one
was
busy
nearly
every
one
seemed
contented
since
nothing
had
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
american
world
and
even
the
progress
of
europe
in
her
track
to
herself
had
ceased
to
be
violent
after
a
dreary
january
in
paris
at
last
when
no
excuse
could
be
persuaded
to
offer
itself
for
further
delay
he
crossed
the
channel
and
passed
a
week
with
his
old
friend
milnes
gaskell
at
thornes
in
yorkshire
while
the
westerly
gales
raved
a
warning
against
going
home
yorkshire
in
january
is
not
an
island
in
the
south
seas
it
has
few
points
of
resemblance
to
tahiti
not
many
to
fiji
or
samoa
but
as
so
often
before
it
was
a
rest
between
past
and
future
and
adams
was
grateful
for
it
at
last
on
february
he
drove
after
a
fashion
down
the
irish
channel
on
board
the
teutonic
he
had
not
crossed
the
atlantic
for
a
dozen
years
and
had
never
seen
an
ocean
steamer
of
the
new
type
he
had
seen
nothing
new
of
any
sort
or
much
changed
in
france
or
england
the
railways
made
quicker
time
but
were
no
more
comfortable
the
scale
was
the
same
the
channel
service
was
hardly
improved
since
or
so
little
as
to
make
no
impression
europe
seemed
to
have
been
stationary
for
twenty
years
to
a
man
who
had
been
stationary
like
europe
the
teutonic
was
a
marvel
that
he
should
be
able
to
eat
his
dinner
through
a
week
of
howling
winter
gales
was
a
miracle
that
he
should
have
a
deck
stateroom
with
fresh
air
and
read
all
night
if
he
chose
by
electric
light
was
matter
for
more
wonder
than
life
had
yet
supplied
in
its
old
forms
wonder
may
be
double
even
treble
wonder
ran
off
into
figures
as
the
niagara
was
to
the
teutonic
as
was
to
so
the
teutonic
and
must
be
to
the
next
term
and
then
apparently
the
question
concerned
only
america
western
europe
offered
no
such
conundrum
there
one
might
double
scale
and
speed
indefinitely
without
passing
bounds
fate
was
kind
on
that
voyage
rudyard
kipling
on
his
wedding
trip
to
america
thanks
to
the
mediation
of
henry
james
dashed
over
the
passenger
his
exuberant
fountain
of
gaiety
and
wit
as
though
playing
a
garden
hose
on
a
thirsty
and
faded
begonia
kipling
could
never
know
what
peace
of
mind
he
gave
for
he
could
hardly
ever
need
it
himself
so
much
and
yet
in
the
full
delight
of
his
endless
fun
and
variety
one
felt
the
old
conundrum
repeat
itself
somehow
somewhere
kipling
and
the
american
were
not
one
but
two
and
could
not
be
glued
together
the
american
felt
that
the
defect
if
defect
it
were
was
in
himself
he
had
felt
it
when
he
was
with
swinburne
and
again
with
robert
louis
stevenson
even
under
the
palms
of
vailima
but
he
did
not
carry
to
the
point
of
thinking
himself
singular
whatever
the
defect
might
be
it
was
american
it
belonged
to
the
type
it
lived
in
the
blood
whatever
the
quality
might
be
that
held
him
apart
it
was
english
it
lived
also
in
the
blood
one
felt
it
little
if
at
all
with
celts
and
one
yearned
reciprocally
among
fiji
cannibals
clarence
king
used
to
say
that
it
was
due
to
discord
between
the
of
the
but
the
theory
offered
difficulties
in
measurement
perhaps
after
all
it
was
only
that
genius
soars
but
this
theory
too
had
its
dark
corners
all
through
life
one
had
seen
the
american
on
his
literary
knees
to
the
european
and
all
through
many
lives
back
for
some
two
centuries
one
had
seen
the
european
snub
or
patronize
the
american
not
always
intentionally
but
effectually
it
was
in
the
nature
of
things
kipling
neither
snubbed
nor
patronized
he
was
all
gaiety
and
but
he
would
have
been
first
to
feel
what
one
meant
genius
has
to
pay
itself
that
unwilling
towards
the
middle
of
february
adams
found
himself
again
in
washington
in
paris
and
london
he
had
seen
nothing
to
make
a
return
to
life
worth
while
in
washington
he
saw
plenty
of
reasons
for
staying
dead
changes
had
taken
place
there
improvements
had
been
made
with
time
much
time
the
city
might
become
habitable
according
to
some
fashionable
standard
but
all
one
friends
had
died
or
disappeared
several
times
over
leaving
one
almost
as
strange
as
in
boston
or
london
slowly
a
certain
society
had
built
itself
up
about
the
government
houses
had
been
opened
and
there
was
much
dining
much
calling
much
leaving
of
cards
but
a
solitary
man
counted
for
less
than
in
society
seemed
hardly
more
at
home
than
he
both
executive
and
congress
held
it
aloof
no
one
in
society
seemed
to
have
the
ear
of
anybody
in
government
no
one
in
government
knew
any
reason
for
consulting
any
one
in
society
the
world
had
ceased
to
be
wholly
political
but
politics
had
become
less
social
a
survivor
of
the
civil
war
like
george
bancroft
or
john
hay
tried
to
keep
footing
but
without
brilliant
success
they
were
free
to
say
or
do
what
they
liked
but
no
one
took
much
notice
of
anything
said
or
done
a
presidential
election
was
to
take
place
in
november
and
no
one
showed
much
interest
in
the
result
the
two
candidates
were
singular
persons
of
whom
it
was
the
common
saying
that
one
of
them
had
no
friends
the
other
only
enemies
calvin
brice
who
was
at
that
time
altogether
the
wittiest
and
cleverest
member
of
the
senate
was
in
the
habit
of
describing
cleveland
in
glowing
terms
and
at
great
length
as
one
of
the
loftiest
natures
and
noblest
characters
of
ancient
or
modern
time
but
he
concluded
in
future
i
prefer
to
look
on
at
his
proceedings
from
the
safe
summit
of
some
neighboring
hill
the
same
remark
applied
to
harrison
in
this
respect
they
were
the
greatest
of
presidents
for
whatever
harm
they
might
do
their
enemies
was
as
nothing
when
compared
to
the
mortality
they
inflicted
on
their
friends
men
fled
them
as
though
they
had
the
evil
eye
to
the
american
people
the
two
candidates
and
the
two
parties
were
so
evenly
balanced
that
the
scales
showed
hardly
a
perceptible
difference
harrison
was
an
excellent
president
a
man
of
ability
and
force
perhaps
the
best
president
the
republican
party
had
put
forward
since
lincoln
death
yet
on
the
whole
adams
felt
a
shade
of
preference
for
president
cleveland
not
so
much
personally
as
because
the
democrats
represented
to
him
the
last
remnants
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
survivors
of
hosea
biglow
cornwallis
the
sole
remaining
protestants
against
a
banker
olympus
which
had
become
for
years
more
and
more
despotic
over
esop
one
might
no
longer
croak
except
to
vote
for
king
log
or
failing
storks
for
grover
cleveland
and
even
then
could
not
be
sure
where
king
banker
lurked
behind
the
costly
education
in
politics
had
led
to
political
torpor
every
one
did
not
share
it
clarence
king
and
john
hay
were
loyal
republicans
who
never
for
a
moment
conceived
that
there
could
be
merit
in
other
ideals
with
king
the
feeling
was
chiefly
love
of
archaic
races
sympathy
with
the
negro
and
indian
and
corresponding
dislike
of
their
enemies
but
with
hay
party
loyalty
became
a
phase
of
being
a
little
like
the
loyalty
of
a
highly
cultivated
churchman
to
his
church
he
saw
all
the
failings
of
the
party
and
still
more
keenly
those
of
the
partisans
but
he
could
not
live
outside
to
adams
a
western
democrat
or
a
western
republican
a
city
democrat
or
a
city
republican
a
whitney
or
a
blaine
were
actually
the
same
man
as
far
as
their
usefulness
to
the
objects
of
king
hay
or
adams
was
concerned
they
graded
themselves
as
friends
or
enemies
not
as
republicans
or
democrats
to
hay
the
difference
was
that
of
being
respectable
or
not
since
king
hay
and
adams
had
been
inseparable
step
by
step
they
had
gone
on
in
the
closest
sympathy
rather
shunning
than
inviting
public
position
until
in
none
of
them
held
any
post
at
all
with
great
effort
in
hayes
administration
all
king
friends
including
abram
hewitt
and
carl
schurz
had
carried
the
bill
for
uniting
the
surveys
and
had
placed
king
at
the
head
of
the
bureau
but
king
waited
only
to
organize
the
service
and
then
resigned
in
order
to
seek
his
private
fortune
in
the
west
hay
after
serving
as
assistant
secretary
of
state
under
secretary
evarts
during
a
part
of
hayes
administration
then
also
insisted
on
going
out
in
order
to
write
with
nicolay
the
life
of
lincoln
adams
had
held
no
office
and
when
his
friends
asked
the
reason
he
could
not
go
into
long
explanations
but
preferred
to
answer
simply
that
no
president
had
ever
invited
him
to
fill
one
the
reason
was
good
and
was
also
conveniently
true
but
left
open
an
awkward
doubt
of
his
morals
or
capacity
why
had
no
president
ever
cared
to
employ
him
the
question
needed
a
volume
of
intricate
explanation
there
never
was
a
day
when
he
would
have
refused
to
perform
any
duty
that
the
government
imposed
on
him
but
the
american
government
never
to
his
knowledge
imposed
duties
the
point
was
never
raised
with
regard
to
him
or
to
any
one
else
the
government
required
candidates
to
offer
the
business
of
the
executive
began
and
ended
with
the
consent
or
refusal
to
confer
the
social
formula
carried
this
passive
attitude
a
shade
further
any
public
man
who
may
for
years
have
used
some
other
man
house
as
his
own
when
promoted
to
a
position
of
patronage
commonly
feels
himself
obliged
to
inquire
directly
or
indirectly
whether
his
friend
wants
anything
which
is
equivalent
to
a
civil
act
of
divorce
since
he
feels
awkward
in
the
old
relation
the
handsomest
formula
in
an
impartial
choice
was
the
grandly
courteous
southern
phrase
of
lamar
of
course
adams
knows
that
anything
in
my
power
is
at
his
service
a
la
disposicion
de
usted
the
form
must
have
been
correct
since
it
released
both
parties
he
was
right
adams
did
know
all
about
it
a
bow
and
a
conventional
smile
closed
the
subject
forever
and
every
one
felt
flattered
such
an
intimate
promoted
to
power
was
always
lost
his
duties
and
cares
absorbed
him
and
affected
his
balance
of
mind
unless
his
friend
served
some
political
purpose
friendship
was
an
effort
men
who
neither
wrote
for
newspapers
nor
made
campaign
speeches
who
rarely
subscribed
to
the
campaign
fund
and
who
entered
the
white
house
as
seldom
as
possible
placed
themselves
outside
the
sphere
of
usefulness
and
did
so
with
entirely
adequate
knowledge
of
what
they
were
doing
they
never
expected
the
president
to
ask
for
their
services
and
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
do
so
as
for
henry
adams
in
fifty
years
that
he
knew
washington
no
one
would
have
been
more
surprised
than
himself
had
any
president
ever
asked
him
to
perform
so
much
of
a
service
as
to
cross
the
square
only
texan
congressmen
imagined
that
the
president
needed
their
services
in
some
remote
consulate
after
worrying
him
for
months
to
find
one
in
washington
this
law
or
custom
is
universally
understood
and
no
one
character
necessarily
suffered
because
he
held
no
office
no
one
took
office
unless
he
wanted
it
and
in
turn
the
outsider
was
never
asked
to
do
work
or
subscribe
money
adams
saw
no
office
that
he
wanted
and
he
gravely
thought
that
from
his
point
of
view
in
the
long
run
he
was
likely
to
be
a
more
useful
citizen
without
office
he
could
at
least
act
as
audience
and
in
those
days
a
washington
audience
seldom
filled
even
a
small
theatre
he
felt
quite
well
satisfied
to
look
on
and
from
time
to
time
he
thought
he
might
risk
a
criticism
of
the
players
but
though
he
found
his
own
position
regular
he
never
quite
understood
that
of
john
hay
the
republican
leaders
treated
hay
as
one
of
themselves
they
asked
his
services
and
took
his
money
with
a
freedom
that
staggered
even
a
hardened
observer
but
they
never
needed
him
in
equivalent
office
in
washington
hay
was
the
only
competent
man
in
the
party
for
diplomatic
work
he
corresponded
in
his
powers
of
usefulness
exactly
with
lord
granville
in
london
who
had
been
for
forty
years
the
saving
grace
of
every
liberal
administration
in
turn
had
usefulness
to
the
public
service
been
ever
a
question
hay
should
have
had
a
mission
under
hayes
should
have
been
placed
in
the
cabinet
by
garfield
and
should
have
been
restored
to
it
by
harrison
these
gentlemen
were
always
using
him
always
invited
his
services
and
always
took
his
money
adams
opinion
of
politics
and
politicians
as
he
frankly
admitted
lacked
enthusiasm
although
never
in
his
severest
temper
did
he
apply
to
them
the
terms
they
freely
applied
to
each
other
and
he
explained
everything
by
his
old
explanation
of
grant
character
as
more
or
less
a
general
type
but
what
roused
in
his
mind
more
rebellion
was
the
patience
and
with
which
hay
allowed
himself
to
be
used
the
trait
was
not
confined
to
politics
hay
seemed
to
like
to
be
used
and
this
was
one
of
his
many
charms
but
in
politics
this
sort
of
demands
supernatural
patience
whatever
astonishing
lapses
of
social
convention
the
politicians
betrayed
hay
laughed
equally
heartily
and
told
the
stories
with
constant
amusement
at
his
own
expense
like
most
americans
he
liked
to
play
at
making
presidents
but
unlike
most
he
laughed
not
only
at
the
presidents
he
helped
to
make
but
also
at
himself
for
laughing
one
must
be
rich
and
come
from
ohio
or
new
york
to
gratify
an
expensive
taste
like
this
other
men
on
both
political
flanks
did
the
same
thing
and
did
it
well
less
for
selfish
objects
than
for
the
amusement
of
the
game
but
hay
alone
lived
in
washington
and
in
the
centre
of
the
ohio
influences
that
ruled
the
republican
party
during
thirty
years
on
the
whole
these
influences
were
respectable
and
although
adams
could
not
under
any
circumstances
have
had
any
value
even
financially
for
ohio
politicians
hay
might
have
much
as
he
showed
if
they
only
knew
enough
to
appreciate
him
the
american
politician
was
occasionally
an
amusing
object
hay
laughed
and
for
want
of
other
resource
adams
laughed
too
but
perhaps
it
was
partly
irritation
at
seeing
how
president
harrison
dealt
his
cards
that
made
adams
welcome
president
cleveland
back
to
the
white
house
at
all
events
neither
hay
nor
king
nor
adams
had
much
to
gain
by
reelecting
harrison
in
or
by
defeating
him
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
and
as
far
as
concerned
cleveland
they
seemed
to
have
even
less
personal
concern
the
whole
country
to
outward
appearance
stood
in
much
the
same
frame
of
mind
everywhere
was
hay
himself
was
almost
as
languid
and
indifferent
as
adams
neither
had
occupation
both
had
finished
their
literary
work
the
life
of
lincoln
had
been
begun
completed
and
published
hand
in
hand
with
the
history
of
jefferson
and
madison
so
that
between
them
they
had
written
nearly
all
the
american
history
there
was
to
write
the
intermediate
period
needed
intermediate
treatment
the
gap
between
james
madison
and
abraham
lincoln
could
not
be
judicially
filled
by
either
of
them
both
were
heartily
tired
of
the
subject
and
america
seemed
as
tired
as
they
what
was
worse
the
redeeming
energy
of
americans
which
had
generally
served
as
the
resource
of
minds
otherwise
vacant
the
creation
of
new
force
the
application
of
expanding
power
showed
signs
of
check
even
the
year
before
in
far
off
in
the
pacific
one
had
met
everywhere
in
the
east
a
sort
of
stagnation
a
creeping
paralysis
complaints
of
shipping
and
producers
that
spread
throughout
the
whole
southern
hemisphere
questions
of
exchange
and
loomed
large
credit
was
shaken
and
a
change
of
party
government
might
shake
it
even
in
washington
the
matter
did
not
concern
adams
who
had
no
credit
and
was
always
richest
when
the
rich
were
poor
but
it
helped
to
dull
the
vibration
of
society
however
they
studied
it
the
balance
of
profit
and
loss
on
the
last
twenty
years
for
the
three
friends
king
hay
and
adams
was
exceedingly
obscure
in
they
had
lost
twenty
years
but
what
had
they
gained
they
often
discussed
the
question
hay
had
a
singular
faculty
for
remembering
faces
and
would
break
off
suddenly
the
thread
of
his
talk
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
on
la
fayette
square
to
notice
an
old
corps
commander
or
admiral
of
the
civil
war
tottering
along
to
the
club
for
his
cards
or
his
cocktail
there
is
old
dash
who
broke
the
rebel
lines
at
blankburg
think
of
his
having
been
a
thunderbolt
of
war
or
what
drew
adams
closer
attention
there
goes
old
boutwell
gambolling
like
the
gambolling
kid
there
they
went
men
who
had
swayed
the
course
of
empire
as
well
as
the
course
of
hay
king
and
adams
less
valued
than
the
ephemeral
congressman
behind
them
who
could
not
have
told
whether
the
general
was
a
boutwell
or
boutwell
a
general
theirs
was
the
highest
known
success
and
one
asked
what
it
was
worth
to
them
apart
from
personal
vanity
what
would
they
sell
it
for
would
any
one
of
them
from
president
downwards
refuse
ten
thousand
a
year
in
place
of
all
the
consideration
he
received
from
the
world
on
account
of
his
success
yet
consideration
had
value
and
at
that
time
adams
enjoyed
lecturing
augustus
gaudens
in
hours
of
depression
on
its
economics
honestly
you
must
admit
that
even
if
you
do
pay
your
expenses
you
get
a
certain
amount
of
advantage
from
doing
the
best
work
very
likely
some
of
the
really
successful
americans
would
be
willing
you
should
come
to
dinner
sometimes
if
you
did
not
come
too
often
while
they
would
think
twice
about
hay
and
would
never
stand
me
the
forgotten
statesman
had
no
value
at
all
the
general
and
admiral
not
much
the
historian
but
little
on
the
whole
the
artist
stood
best
and
of
course
wealth
rested
outside
the
question
since
it
was
acting
as
judge
but
in
the
last
resort
the
judge
certainly
admitted
that
consideration
had
some
value
as
an
asset
though
hardly
as
much
as
ten
or
five
thousand
a
year
hay
and
adams
had
the
advantage
of
looking
out
of
their
windows
on
the
antiquities
of
la
fayette
square
with
the
sense
of
having
all
that
any
one
had
all
that
the
world
had
to
offer
all
that
they
wanted
in
life
including
their
names
on
scores
of
and
in
one
or
two
biographical
dictionaries
but
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
consideration
and
they
knew
no
more
than
boutwell
or
gaudens
whether
to
call
it
success
hay
had
passed
ten
years
in
writing
the
life
of
lincoln
and
perhaps
president
lincoln
was
the
better
for
it
but
what
hay
got
from
it
was
not
so
easy
to
see
except
the
privilege
of
seeing
popular
steal
from
his
book
and
cover
the
theft
by
abusing
the
author
adams
had
given
ten
or
a
dozen
years
to
jefferson
and
madison
with
expenses
which
in
any
mercantile
business
could
hardly
have
been
reckoned
at
less
than
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
on
a
salary
of
five
thousand
a
year
and
when
he
asked
what
return
he
got
from
this
expenditure
rather
more
extravagant
in
proportion
to
his
means
than
a
he
could
see
none
whatever
such
works
never
return
money
even
frank
parkman
never
printed
a
first
edition
of
his
relatively
cheap
and
popular
volumes
numbering
more
than
seven
hundred
copies
until
quite
at
the
end
of
his
life
a
thousand
copies
of
a
book
that
cost
twenty
dollars
or
more
was
as
much
as
any
author
could
expect
two
thousand
copies
was
a
visionary
estimate
unless
it
were
canvassed
for
subscription
as
far
as
adams
knew
he
had
but
three
serious
readers
abram
hewitt
wayne
mcveagh
and
hay
himself
he
was
amply
satisfied
with
their
consideration
and
could
dispense
with
that
of
the
other
million
nine
hundred
and
thousand
nine
hundred
and
but
neither
he
nor
hay
was
better
off
in
any
other
respect
and
their
chief
title
to
consideration
was
their
right
to
look
out
of
their
windows
on
great
men
alive
or
dead
in
la
fayette
square
a
privilege
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
writings
the
world
was
always
civil
glad
to
be
amused
to
any
one
who
amused
it
patient
with
every
one
who
did
not
insist
on
putting
himself
in
its
way
or
costing
it
money
but
this
was
not
consideration
still
less
power
in
any
of
its
concrete
forms
and
applied
as
well
or
better
to
a
comic
actor
certainly
a
rare
soprano
or
tenor
voice
earned
infinitely
more
applause
as
it
gave
infinitely
more
pleasure
even
in
america
but
one
does
what
one
can
with
one
means
and
casting
up
one
balance
sheet
one
expects
only
a
reasonable
return
on
one
capital
hay
and
adams
had
risked
nothing
and
never
played
for
high
stakes
king
had
followed
the
ambitious
course
he
had
played
for
many
millions
he
had
more
than
once
come
close
to
a
great
success
but
the
result
was
still
in
doubt
and
meanwhile
he
was
passing
the
best
years
of
his
life
underground
for
companionship
he
was
mostly
lost
thus
in
neither
hay
king
nor
adams
knew
whether
they
had
attained
success
or
how
to
estimate
it
or
what
to
call
it
and
the
american
people
seemed
to
have
no
clearer
idea
than
they
indeed
the
american
people
had
no
idea
at
all
they
were
wandering
in
a
wilderness
much
more
sandy
than
the
hebrews
had
ever
trodden
about
sinai
they
had
neither
serpents
nor
golden
calves
to
worship
they
had
lost
the
sense
of
worship
for
the
idea
that
they
worshipped
money
seemed
a
delusion
worship
of
money
was
an
trait
a
healthy
appetite
akin
to
worship
of
the
gods
or
to
worship
of
power
in
any
concrete
shape
but
the
american
wasted
money
more
recklessly
than
any
one
ever
did
before
he
spent
more
to
less
purpose
than
any
extravagant
court
aristocracy
he
had
no
sense
of
relative
values
and
knew
not
what
to
do
with
his
money
when
he
got
it
except
use
it
to
make
more
or
throw
it
away
probably
since
human
society
began
it
had
seen
no
such
curious
spectacle
as
the
houses
of
the
san
francisco
millionaires
on
nob
hill
except
for
the
railway
system
the
enormous
wealth
taken
out
of
the
ground
since
had
disappeared
west
of
the
alleghenies
the
whole
country
might
have
been
swept
clean
and
could
have
been
replaced
in
better
form
within
one
or
two
years
the
american
mind
had
less
respect
for
money
than
the
european
or
asiatic
mind
and
bore
its
loss
more
easily
but
it
had
been
deflected
by
its
pursuit
till
it
could
turn
in
no
other
direction
it
shunned
distrusted
disliked
the
dangerous
attraction
of
ideals
and
stood
alone
in
history
for
its
ignorance
of
the
past
personal
contact
brought
this
american
trait
close
to
notice
his
first
step
on
returning
to
washington
took
him
out
to
the
cemetery
known
as
rock
creek
to
see
the
bronze
figure
which
gaudens
had
made
for
him
in
his
absence
naturally
every
detail
interested
him
every
line
every
touch
of
the
artist
every
change
of
light
and
shade
every
point
of
relation
every
possible
doubt
of
gaudens
correctness
of
taste
or
feeling
so
that
as
the
spring
approached
he
was
apt
to
stop
there
often
to
see
what
the
figure
had
to
tell
him
that
was
new
but
in
all
that
it
had
to
say
he
never
once
thought
of
questioning
what
it
meant
he
supposed
its
meaning
to
be
the
one
commonplace
about
it
the
oldest
idea
known
to
human
thought
he
knew
that
if
he
asked
an
asiatic
its
meaning
not
a
man
woman
or
child
from
cairo
to
kamtchatka
would
have
needed
more
than
a
glance
to
reply
from
the
egyptian
sphinx
to
the
kamakura
daibuts
from
prometheus
to
christ
from
michael
angelo
to
shelley
art
had
wrought
on
this
eternal
figure
almost
as
though
it
had
nothing
else
to
say
the
interest
of
the
figure
was
not
in
its
meaning
but
in
the
response
of
the
observer
as
adams
sat
there
numbers
of
people
came
for
the
figure
seemed
to
have
become
a
tourist
fashion
and
all
wanted
to
know
its
meaning
most
took
it
for
a
and
the
remnant
were
in
the
absence
of
a
personal
guide
none
felt
what
would
have
been
a
to
a
hindu
baby
or
a
japanese
the
only
exceptions
were
the
clergy
who
taught
a
lesson
even
deeper
one
after
another
brought
companions
there
and
apparently
fascinated
by
their
own
reflection
broke
out
passionately
against
the
expression
they
felt
in
the
figure
of
despair
of
atheism
of
denial
like
the
others
the
priest
saw
only
what
he
brought
like
all
great
artists
gaudens
held
up
the
mirror
and
no
more
the
american
layman
had
lost
sight
of
ideals
the
american
priest
had
lost
sight
of
faith
both
were
more
american
than
the
old
soldiers
who
denounced
the
wasting
on
a
mere
grave
of
money
which
should
have
been
given
for
drink
landed
lost
and
forgotten
in
the
centre
of
this
vast
plain
of
adams
could
see
but
one
active
interest
to
which
all
others
were
subservient
and
which
absorbed
the
energies
of
some
sixty
million
people
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
force
real
or
imaginary
the
power
of
the
railway
system
had
enormously
increased
since
already
the
coal
output
of
tons
closely
approached
the
of
the
british
empire
and
one
held
breath
at
the
nearness
of
what
one
had
never
expected
to
see
the
crossing
of
courses
and
the
lead
of
american
energies
the
moment
was
deeply
exciting
to
a
historian
but
the
railway
system
itself
interested
one
less
than
in
since
it
offered
less
chance
for
future
profit
adams
had
been
born
with
the
railway
system
had
grown
up
with
it
had
been
over
pretty
nearly
every
mile
of
it
with
curious
eyes
and
knew
as
much
about
it
as
his
neighbors
but
not
there
could
he
look
for
a
new
education
incomplete
though
it
was
the
system
seemed
on
the
whole
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
society
better
than
any
other
part
of
the
social
machine
and
society
was
content
with
its
creation
for
the
time
and
with
itself
for
creating
it
nothing
new
was
to
be
done
or
learned
there
and
the
world
hurried
on
to
its
telephones
bicycles
and
electric
trams
at
past
fifty
adams
solemnly
and
painfully
learned
to
ride
the
bicycle
nothing
else
occurred
to
him
as
a
means
of
new
life
nothing
else
offered
itself
however
carefully
he
sought
he
looked
for
no
change
he
lingered
in
washington
till
near
july
without
noticing
a
new
idea
then
he
went
back
to
england
to
pass
his
summer
on
the
deeside
in
october
he
returned
to
washington
and
there
awaited
the

of
cleveland
which
led
to
no
deeper
thought
than
that
of
taking
up
some
small
notes
that
happened
to
be
outstanding
he
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
to
be
a
coward
and
above
all
he
had
an
uneasy
distrust

drifting
in
the
of
the
and
during
this
last
decade
every
one
talked
and
seemed
to
feel
where
not
a
breath
stirred
the
idle
air
of
education
or
fretted
the
mental
torpor
of
one
lived
alone
adams
had
long
ceased
going
into
society
for
years
he
had
not
dined
out
of
his
own
house
and
in
public
his
face
was
as
unknown
as
that
of
an
extinct
statesman
he
had
often
noticed
that
six
months
oblivion
amounts
to
and
that
resurrection
is
rare
nothing
is
easier
if
a
man
wants
it
than
rest
profound
as
the
grave
his
friends
sometimes
took
pity
on
him
and
came
to
share
a
meal
or
pass
a
night
on
their
passage
south
or
northwards
but
existence
was
on
the
whole
exceedingly
solitary
or
seemed
so
to
him
of
the
society
favorites
who
made
the
life
of
every
and
of
the
halls
of
congress
tom
reed
bourke
cockran
edward
wolcott
he
knew
not
one
although
calvin
brice
was
his
next
neighbor
for
six
years
entertaining
lavishly
as
no
one
had
ever
entertained
before
in
washington
adams
never
entered
his
house
whitney
rivalled
senator
brice
in
hospitality
and
was
besides
an
old
acquaintance
of
the
reforming
era
but
adams
saw
him
as
little
as
he
saw
his
chief
president
cleveland
or
president
harrison
or
secretary
bayard
or
blaine
or
olney
one
has
no
choice
but
to
go
everywhere
or
nowhere
no
one
may
pick
and
choose
between
houses
or
accept
hospitality
without
returning
it
he
loved
solitude
as
little
as
others
did
but
he
was
unfit
for
social
work
and
he
sank
under
the
surface
luckily
for
such
helpless
animals
as
solitary
men
the
world
is
not
only
but
even
friendly
and
generous
it
loves
to
pardon
if
pardon
is
not
demanded
as
a
right
adams
social
offences
were
many
and
no
one
was
more
sensitive
to
it
than
himself
but
a
few
houses
always
remained
which
he
could
enter
without
being
asked
and
quit
without
being
noticed
one
was
john
hay
another
was
cabot
lodge
a
third
led
to
an
intimacy
which
had
the
singular
effect
of
educating
him
in
knowledge
of
the
very
class
of
american
politician
who
had
done
most
to
block
his
intended
path
in
life
senator
cameron
of
pennsylvania
had
married
in
a
young
niece
of
senator
john
sherman
of
ohio
thus
making
an
alliance
of
dynastic
importance
in
politics
and
in
society
a
reign
of
sixteen
years
during
which
cameron
and
lodge
led
a
career
without
precedent
and
without
succession
as
the
dispensers
of
sunshine
over
washington
both
of
them
had
been
kind
to
adams
and
a
dozen
years
of
this
intimacy
had
made
him
one
of
their
habitual
household
as
he
was
of
hay
in
a
small
society
such
ties
between
houses
become
political
and
social
force
without
intention
or
consciousness
they
fix
one
status
in
the
world
whatever
preferences
in
politics
might
be
one
house
was
bound
to
the
republican
interest
when
sandwiched
between
senator
cameron
john
hay
and
cabot
lodge
with
theodore
roosevelt
equally
at
home
in
them
all
and
cecil
to
unite
them
by
impartial
variety
the
relation
was
daily
and
the
alliance
undisturbed
by
power
or
patronage
since
harrison
in
those
respects
showed
little
more
taste
than
cleveland
for
the
society
and
interests
of
this
particular
band
of
followers
whose
relations
with
the
white
house
were
sometimes
comic
but
never
intimate
in
february
senator
cameron
took
his
family
to
south
carolina
where
he
had
bought
an
old
plantation
at
coffin
point
on
helena
island
and
adams
as
one
of
the
family
was
taken
with
the
rest
to
open
the
new
experience
from
there
he
went
on
to
havana
and
came
back
to
coffin
point
to
linger
till
near
april
in
may
the
senator
took
his
family
to
chicago
to
see
the
exposition
and
adams
went
with
them
early
in
june
all
sailed
for
england
together
and
at
last
in
the
middle
of
july
all
found
themselves
in
switzerland
at
prangins
chamounix
and
zermatt
on
july
they
drove
across
the
furka
pass
and
went
down
by
rail
to
lucerne
months
of
close
contact
teach
character
if
character
has
interest
and
to
adams
the
cameron
type
had
keen
interest
ever
since
it
had
shipwrecked
his
career
in
the
person
of
president
grant
perhaps
it
owed
life
to
scotch
blood
perhaps
to
the
blood
of
adam
and
eve
the
primitive
strain
of
man
perhaps
only
to
the
blood
of
the
cottager
working
against
the
blood
of
the
townsman
but
whatever
it
was
one
liked
it
for
its
simplicity
the
pennsylvania
mind
as
minds
go
was
not
complex
it
reasoned
little
and
never
talked
but
in
practical
matters
it
was
the
steadiest
of
all
american
types
perhaps
the
most
efficient
certainly
the
safest
adams
had
printed
as
much
as
this
in
his
books
but
had
never
been
able
to
find
a
type
to
describe
the
two
great
historical
pennsylvanians
having
been
as
every
one
had
so
often
heard
benjamin
franklin
of
boston
and
albert
gallatin
of
geneva
of
albert
gallatin
indeed
he
had
made
a
voluminous
study
and
an
elaborate
picture
only
to
show
that
he
was
if
american
at
all
a
new
yorker
with
a
calvinistic
strain
rather
connecticut
than
pennsylvanian
the
true
pennsylvanian
was
a
narrower
type
as
narrow
as
the
kirk
as
shy
of
other
people
narrowness
as
a
yankee
as
as
a
puritan
farmer
to
him
none
but
pennsylvanians
were
white
chinaman
negro
dago
italian
englishman
yankee
all
was
one
in
the
depths
of
pennsylvanian
consciousness
the
mental
machine
could
run
only
on
what
it
took
for
american
lines
this
was
familiar
ever
since
one
study
of
president
grant
in
but
in
as
then
the
type
was
admirably
strong
and
useful
if
one
wanted
only
to
run
on
the
same
lines
practically
the
pennsylvanian
forgot
his
prejudices
when
he
allied
his
interests
he
then
became
supple
in
action
and
large
in
motive
whatever
he
thought
of
his
colleagues
when
he
happened
to
be
right
which
was
of
course
whenever
one
agreed
with
him
he
was
the
strongest
american
in
america
as
an
ally
he
was
worth
all
the
rest
because
he
understood
his
own
class
who
were
always
a
majority
and
knew
how
to
deal
with
them
as
no
new
englander
could
if
one
wanted
work
done
in
congress
one
did
wisely
to
avoid
asking
a
new
englander
to
do
it
a
pennsylvanian
not
only
could
do
it
but
did
it
willingly
practically
and
intelligently
never
in
the
range
of
human
possibilities
had
a
cameron
believed
in
an
adams
or
an
adams
in
a
cameron
but
they
had
curiously
enough
almost
always
worked
together
the
camerons
had
what
the
adamses
thought
the
political
vice
of
reaching
their
objects
without
much
regard
to
their
methods
the
loftiest
virtue
of
the
pennsylvania
machine
had
never
been
its
scrupulous
purity
or
sparkling
professions
the
machine
worked
by
coarse
means
on
coarse
interests
but
its
practical
success
had
been
the
most
curious
subject
of
study
in
american
history
when
one
summed
up
the
results
of
pennsylvanian
influence
one
inclined
to
think
that
pennsylvania
set
up
the
government
in
saved
it
in
created
the
american
system
developed
its
iron
and
coal
power
and
invented
its
great
railways
following
up
the
same
line
in
his
studies
of
american
character
adams
reached
the
result
to
him
altogether
paradoxical
that
qualities
and
defects
united
in
equal
share
to
make
him
the
most
useful
member
of
the
senate
in
the
interest
of
studying
at
last
a
perfect
and
favorable
specimen
of
this
american
type
which
had
so
persistently
suppressed
his
own
adams
was
slow
to
notice
that
cameron
strongly
influenced
him
but
he
could
not
see
a
trace
of
any
influence
which
he
exercised
on
cameron
not
an
opinion
or
a
view
of
his
on
any
subject
was
ever
reflected
back
on
him
from
cameron
mind
not
even
an
expression
or
a
fact
yet
the
difference
in
age
was
trifling
and
in
education
slight
on
the
other
hand
cameron
made
deep
impression
on
adams
and
in
nothing
so
much
as
on
the
great
subject
of
discussion
that
year
the
question
of
silver
adams
had
taken
no
interest
in
the
matter
and
knew
nothing
about
it
except
as
a
very
tedious
hobby
of
his
friend
dana
horton
but
inevitably
from
the
moment
he
was
forced
to
choose
sides
he
was
sure
to
choose
silver
every
political
idea
and
personal
prejudice
he
ever
dallied
with
held
him
to
the
silver
standard
and
made
a
barrier
between
him
and
gold
he
knew
well
enough
all
that
was
to
be
said
for
the
gold
standard
as
economy
but
he
had
never
in
his
life
taken
politics
for
a
pursuit
of
economy
one
might
have
a
political
or
an
economical
policy
one
could
not
have
both
at
the
same
time
this
was
heresy
in
the
english
school
but
it
had
always
been
law
in
the
american
equally
he
knew
all
that
was
to
be
said
on
the
moral
side
of
the
question
and
he
admitted
that
his
interests
were
as
boston
maintained
wholly
on
the
side
of
gold
but
had
they
been
ten
times
as
great
as
they
were
he
could
not
have
helped
his
bankers
or
croupiers
to
load
the
dice
and
pack
the
cards
to
make
sure
his
winning
the
stakes
at
least
he
was
bound
to
profess
disapproval
or
thought
he
was
from
early
childhood
his
moral
principles
had
struggled
blindly
with
his
interests
but
he
was
certain
of
one
law
that
ruled
all
others
masses
of
men
invariably
follow
interests
in
deciding
morals
morality
is
a
private
and
costly
luxury
the
morality
of
the
silver
or
gold
standards
was
to
be
decided
by
popular
vote
and
the
popular
vote
would
be
decided
by
interests
but
on
which
side
lay
the
larger
interest
to
him
the
interest
was
political
he
thought
it
probably
his
last
chance
of
standing
up
for
his
principles
strict
construction
limited
powers
george
washington
john
adams
and
the
rest
he
had
in
a
way
struggled
all
his
life
against
state
street
banks
capitalism
altogether
as
he
knew
it
in
old
england
or
new
england
and
he
was
fated
to
make
his
last
resistance
behind
the
silver
standard
for
him
this
result
was
clear
and
if
he
erred
he
erred
in
company
with
nine
men
out
of
ten
in
washington
for
there
was
little
difference
on
the
merits
adams
was
sure
to
learn
backwards
but
the
case
seemed
entirely
different
with
cameron
a
typical
pennsylvanian
a
practical
politician
whom
all
the
reformers
including
all
the
adamses
had
abused
for
a
lifetime
for
subservience
to
moneyed
interests
and
political
jobbery
he
was
sure
to
go
with
the
banks
and
corporations
which
had
made
and
sustained
him
on
the
contrary
he
stood
out
obstinately
as
the
leading
champion
of
silver
in
the
east
the
reformers
represented
by
the
evening
post
and
godkin
whose
personal
interests
lay
with
the
gold
standard
at
once
assumed
that
senator
cameron
had
a
personal
interest
in
silver
and
denounced
his
corruption
as
hotly
as
though
he
had
been
convicted
of
taking
a
bribe
more
than
silver
and
gold
the
moral
standard
interested
adams
his
own
interests
were
with
gold
but
he
supported
silver
the
evening
post
and
godkin
interests
were
with
gold
and
they
frankly
said
so
yet
they
avowedly
pursued
their
interests
even
into
politics
interests
had
always
been
with
the
corporations
yet
he
supported
silver
thus
morality
required
that
adams
should
be
condemned
for
going
against
his
interests
that
godkin
was
virtuous
in
following
his
interests
and
that
cameron
was
a
scoundrel
whatever
he
did
granting
that
one
of
the
three
was
a
moral
idiot
which
was
it
adams
or
godkin
or
cameron
until
a
council
or
a
pope
or
a
congress
or
the
newspapers
or
a
popular
election
has
decided
a
question
of
doubtful
morality
individuals
are
apt
to
err
especially
when
putting
money
into
their
own
pockets
but
in
democracies
the
majority
alone
gives
law
to
any
one
who
knew
the
relative
popularity
of
cameron
and
godkin
the
idea
of
a
popular
vote
between
them
seemed
excessively
humorous
yet
the
popular
vote
in
the
end
did
decide
against
cameron
for
godkin
the
boston
moralist
and
reformer
went
on
as
always
like
johnson
impatiently
stamping
his
foot
and
following
his
interests
or
his
antipathies
but
the
true
american
slow
to
grasp
new
and
complicated
ideas
groped
in
the
dark
to
discover
where
his
greater
interest
lay
as
usual
the
banks
taught
him
in
the
course
of
fifty
years
the
banks
taught
one
many
wise
lessons
for
which
an
insect
had
to
be
grateful
whether
it
liked
them
or
not
but
of
all
the
lessons
adams
learned
from
them
none
compared
in
dramatic
effect
with
that
of
july
when
after
talking
silver
all
the
morning
with
senator
cameron
on
the
top
of
their
crossing
the
furka
pass
they
reached
lucerne
in
the
afternoon
where
adams
found
letters
from
his
brothers
requesting
his
immediate
return
to
boston
because
the
community
was
bankrupt
and
he
was
probably
a
beggar
if
he
wanted
education
he
knew
no
quicker
mode
of
learning
a
lesson
than
that
of
being
struck
on
the
head
by
it
and
yet
he
was
himself
surprised
at
his
own
slowness
to
understand
what
had
struck
him
for
several
years
a
sufferer
from
insomnia
his
first
thought
was
of
beggary
of
nerves
and
he
made
ready
to
face
a
sleepless
night
but
although
his
mind
tried
to
wrestle
with
the
problem
how
any
man
could
be
ruined
who
had
months
before
paid
off
every
dollar
of
debt
he
knew
himself
to
owe
he
gave
up
that
insoluble
riddle
in
order
to
fall
back
on
the
larger
principle
that
beggary
could
be
no
more
for
him
than
it
was
for
others
who
were
more
valuable
members
of
society
and
with
that
he
went
to
sleep
like
a
good
citizen
and
the
next
day
started
for
quincy
where
he
arrived
august
as
a
for
a
new
education
at
years
old
the
shock
of
finding
one
self
suspended
for
several
months
over
the
edge
of
bankruptcy
without
knowing
how
one
got
there
or
how
to
get
away
is
to
be
strongly
recommended
by
slow
degrees
the
situation
dawned
on
him
that
the
banks
had
lent
him
among
others
some
money
thousands
of
millions
were
as
bankruptcy
the
same
for
which
he
among
others
was
responsible
and
of
which
he
knew
no
more
than
they
the
humor
of
this
situation
seemed
to
him
so
much
more
pointed
than
the
terror
as
to
make
him
laugh
at
himself
with
a
sincerity
he
had
been
long
strange
to
as
far
as
he
could
comprehend
he
had
nothing
to
lose
that
he
cared
about
but
the
banks
stood
to
lose
their
existence
money
mattered
as
little
to
him
as
to
anybody
but
money
was
their
life
for
the
first
time
he
had
the
banks
in
his
power
he
could
afford
to
laugh
and
the
whole
community
was
in
the
same
position
though
few
laughed
all
sat
down
on
the
banks
and
asked
what
the
banks
were
going
to
do
about
it
to
adams
the
situation
seemed
farcical
but
the
more
he
saw
of
it
the
less
he
understood
it
he
was
quite
sure
that
nobody
understood
it
much
better
blindly
some
very
powerful
energy
was
at
work
doing
something
that
nobody
wanted
done
when
adams
went
to
his
bank
to
draw
a
hundred
dollars
of
his
own
money
on
deposit
the
cashier
refused
to
let
him
have
more
than
fifty
and
adams
accepted
the
fifty
without
complaint
because
he
was
himself
refusing
to
let
the
banks
have
some
hundreds
or
thousands
that
belonged
to
them
each
wanted
to
help
the
other
yet
both
refused
to
pay
their
debts
and
he
could
find
no
answer
to
the
question
which
was
responsible
for
getting
the
other
into
the
situation
since
lenders
and
borrowers
were
the
same
interest
and
socially
the
same
person
evidently
the
force
was
one
its
operation
was
mechanical
its
effect
must
be
proportional
to
its
power
but
no
one
knew
what
it
meant
and
most
people
dismissed
it
as
an
emotion
a
panic
that
meant
nothing
men
died
like
flies
under
the
strain
and
boston
grew
suddenly
old
haggard
and
thin
adams
alone
waxed
fat
and
was
happy
for
at
last
he
had
got
hold
of
his
world
and
could
finish
his
education
interrupted
for
twenty
years
he
cared
not
whether
it
were
worth
finishing
if
only
it
amused
but
he
seemed
for
the
first
time
since
to
feel
that
something
new
and
curious
was
about
to
happen
to
the
world
great
changes
had
taken
place
since
in
the
forces
at
work
the
old
machine
ran
far
behind
its
duty
somewhere
somehow
it
was
bound
to
break
down
and
if
it
happened
to
break
precisely
over
head
it
gave
the
better
chance
for
study
for
the
first
time
in
several
years
he
saw
much
of
his
brother
brooks
in
quincy
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
absorbed
in
the
same
perplexities
brooks
was
then
a
man
of
years
old
a
strong
writer
and
a
vigorous
thinker
who
irritated
too
many
boston
conventions
ever
to
suit
the
atmosphere
but
the
two
brothers
could
talk
to
each
other
without
atmosphere
and
were
used
to
audiences
of
one
brooks
had
discovered
or
developed
a
law
of
history
that
civilization
followed
the
exchanges
and
having
worked
it
out
for
the
mediterranean
was
working
it
out
for
the
atlantic
everything
american
as
well
as
most
things
european
and
asiatic
became
unstable
by
this
law
seeking
new
equilibrium
and
compelled
to
find
it
loving
paradox
brooks
with
the
advantages
of
ten
years
study
had
swept
away
much
rubbish
in
the
effort
to
build
up
a
new
line
of
thought
for
himself
but
he
found
that
no
paradox
compared
with
that
of
daily
events
the
facts
were
constantly
outrunning
his
thoughts
the
instability
was
greater
than
he
calculated
the
speed
of
acceleration
passed
bounds
among
other
general
rules
he
laid
down
the
paradox
that
in
the
social
disequilibrium
between
capital
and
labor
the
logical
outcome
was
not
collectivism
but
anarchism
and
henry
made
note
of
it
for
study
by
the
time
he
got
back
to
washington
on
september
the
storm
having
partly
blown
over
life
had
taken
on
a
new
face
and
one
so
interesting
that
he
set
off
to
chicago
to
study
the
exposition
again
and
stayed
there
a
fortnight
absorbed
in
it
he
found
matter
of
study
to
fill
a
hundred
years
and
his
education
spread
over
chaos
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
this
year
education
went
mad
the
silver
question
thorny
as
it
was
fell
into
relations
as
simple
as
words
of
one
syllable
compared
with
the
problems
of
credit
and
exchange
that
came
to
complicate
it
and
when
one
sought
rest
at
chicago
educational
game
started
like
rabbits
from
every
building
and
ran
out
of
sight
among
thousands
of
its
kind
before
one
could
mark
its
burrow
the
exposition
itself
defied
philosophy
one
might
find
fault
till
the
last
gate
closed
one
could
still
explain
nothing
that
needed
explanation
as
a
scenic
display
paris
had
never
approached
it
but
the
inconceivable
scenic
display
consisted
in
its
being
there
at
all
more
surprising
as
it
was
than
anything
else
on
the
continent
niagara
falls
the
yellowstone
geysers
and
the
whole
railway
system
thrown
in
since
these
were
all
natural
products
in
their
place
while
since
noah
ark
no
such
babel
of
loose
and
ill
joined
such
vague
and
and
unrelated
thoughts
and
and
experimental
outcries
as
the
exposition
had
ever
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
lakes
the
first
astonishment
became
greater
every
day
that
the
exposition
should
be
a
natural
growth
and
product
of
the
northwest
offered
a
step
in
evolution
to
startle
darwin
but
that
it
should
be
anything
else
seemed
an
idea
more
startling
still
and
even
granting
it
were
not
admitting
it
to
be
a
sort
of
industrial
speculative
growth
and
product
of
the
beaux
arts
artistically
induced
to
pass
the
summer
on
the
shore
of
lake
michigan
could
it
be
made
to
seem
at
home
there
was
the
american
made
to
seem
at
home
in
it
honestly
he
had
the
air
of
enjoying
it
as
though
it
were
all
his
own
he
felt
it
was
good
he
was
proud
of
it
for
the
most
part
he
acted
as
though
he
had
passed
his
life
in
landscape
gardening
and
architectural
decoration
if
he
had
not
done
it
himself
he
had
known
how
to
get
it
done
to
suit
him
as
he
knew
how
to
get
his
wives
and
daughters
dressed
at
worth
or
paquin
perhaps
he
could
not
do
it
again
the
next
time
he
would
want
to
do
it
himself
and
would
show
his
own
faults
but
for
the
moment
he
seemed
to
have
leaped
directly
from
corinth
and
syracuse
and
venice
over
the
heads
of
london
and
new
york
to
impose
classical
standards
on
plastic
chicago
critics
had
no
trouble
in
criticising
the
classicism
but
all
trading
cities
had
always
shown
traders
taste
and
to
the
stern
purist
of
religious
faith
no
art
was
thinner
than
venetian
gothic
all
trader
taste
smelt
of
chicago
tried
at
least
to
give
her
taste
a
look
of
unity
one
sat
down
to
ponder
on
the
steps
beneath
richard
hunt
dome
almost
as
deeply
as
on
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
and
much
to
the
same
purpose
here
was
a
breach
of
continuity
a
rupture
in
historical
sequence
was
it
real
or
only
apparent
one
personal
universe
hung
on
the
answer
for
if
the
rupture
was
real
and
the
new
american
world
could
take
this
sharp
and
conscious
twist
towards
ideals
personal
friends
would
come
in
at
last
as
winners
in
the
great
american
for
fame
if
the
people
of
the
northwest
actually
knew
what
was
good
when
they
saw
it
they
would
some
day
talk
about
hunt
and
richardson
la
farge
and
gaudens
burnham
and
mckim
and
stanford
white
when
their
politicians
and
millionaires
were
otherwise
forgotten
the
artists
and
architects
who
had
done
the
work
offered
little
encouragement
to
hope
it
they
talked
freely
enough
but
not
in
terms
that
one
cared
to
quote
and
to
them
the
northwest
refused
to
look
artistic
they
talked
as
though
they
worked
only
for
themselves
as
though
art
to
the
western
people
was
a
stage
decoration
a
diamond
a
paper
collar
but
possibly
the
architects
of
paestum
and
girgenti
had
talked
in
the
same
way
and
the
greek
had
said
the
same
thing
of
semitic
carthage
two
thousand
years
ago
jostled
by
these
hopes
and
doubts
one
turned
to
the
exhibits
for
help
and
found
it
the
industrial
schools
tried
to
teach
so
much
and
so
quickly
that
the
instruction
ran
to
waste
some
millions
of
other
people
felt
the
same
helplessness
but
few
of
them
were
seeking
education
and
to
them
helplessness
seemed
natural
and
normal
for
they
had
grown
up
in
the
habit
of
thinking
a
or
a
dynamo
as
natural
as
the
sun
and
expected
to
understand
one
as
little
as
the
other
for
the
historian
alone
the
exposition
made
a
serious
effort
historical
exhibits
were
common
but
they
never
went
far
enough
none
were
thoroughly
worked
out
one
of
the
best
was
that
of
the
cunard
steamers
but
still
a
student
hungry
for
results
found
himself
obliged
to
waste
a
pencil
and
several
sheets
of
paper
trying
to
calculate
exactly
when
according
to
the
given
increase
of
power
tonnage
and
speed
the
growth
of
the
ocean
steamer
would
reach
its
limits
his
figures
brought
him
he
thought
to
the
year
another
generation
to
spare
before
force
space
and
time
should
meet
the
ocean
steamer
ran
the
surest
line
of
triangulation
into
the
future
because
it
was
the
nearest
of
man
products
to
a
unity
railroads
taught
less
because
they
seemed
already
finished
except
for
mere
increase
in
number
explosives
taught
most
but
needed
a
tribe
of
chemists
physicists
and
mathematicians
to
explain
the
dynamo
taught
least
because
it
had
barely
reached
infancy
and
if
its
progress
was
to
be
constant
at
the
rate
of
the
last
ten
years
it
would
result
in
infinite
costless
energy
within
a
generation
one
lingered
long
among
the
dynamos
for
they
were
new
and
they
gave
to
history
a
new
phase
men
of
science
could
never
understand
the
ignorance
and
naivete
of
the
historian
who
when
he
came
suddenly
on
a
new
power
asked
naturally
what
it
was
did
it
pull
or
did
it
push
was
it
a
screw
or
thrust
did
it
flow
or
vibrate
was
it
a
wire
or
a
mathematical
line
and
a
score
of
such
questions
to
which
he
expected
answers
and
was
astonished
to
get
none
education
ran
riot
at
chicago
at
least
for
retarded
minds
which
had
never
faced
in
concrete
form
so
many
matters
of
which
they
were
ignorant
men
who
knew
nothing
whatever
who
had
never
run
a
the
simplest
of
forces
who
had
never
put
their
hands
on
a
lever
had
never
touched
an
electric
battery
never
talked
through
a
telephone
and
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
notion
what
amount
of
force
was
meant
by
a
watt
or
an
ampere
or
an
erg
or
any
other
term
of
measurement
introduced
within
a
hundred
years
had
no
choice
but
to
sit
down
on
the
steps
and
brood
as
they
had
never
brooded
on
the
benches
of
harvard
college
either
as
student
or
professor
aghast
at
what
they
had
said
and
done
in
all
these
years
and
still
more
ashamed
of
the
childlike
ignorance
and
babbling
futility
of
the
society
that
let
them
say
and
do
it
the
historical
mind
can
think
only
in
historical
processes
and
probably
this
was
the
first
time
since
historians
existed
that
any
of
them
had
sat
down
helpless
before
a
mechanical
sequence
before
a
metaphysical
or
a
theological
or
a
political
sequence
most
historians
had
felt
helpless
but
the
single
clue
to
which
they
had
hitherto
trusted
was
the
unity
of
natural
force
did
he
himself
quite
know
what
he
meant
certainly
not
if
he
had
known
enough
to
state
his
problem
his
education
would
have
been
complete
at
once
chicago
asked
in
for
the
first
time
the
question
whether
the
american
people
knew
where
they
were
driving
adams
answered
for
one
that
he
did
not
know
but
would
try
to
find
out
on
reflecting
sufficiently
deeply
under
the
shadow
of
richard
architecture
he
decided
that
the
american
people
probably
knew
no
more
than
he
did
but
that
they
might
still
be
driving
or
drifting
unconsciously
to
some
point
in
thought
as
their
solar
system
was
said
to
be
drifting
towards
some
point
in
space
and
that
possibly
if
relations
enough
could
be
observed
this
point
might
be
fixed
chicago
was
the
first
expression
of
american
thought
as
a
unity
one
must
start
there
washington
was
the
second
when
he
got
back
there
he
fell
headlong
into
the
extra
session
of
congress
called
to
repeal
the
silver
act
the
silver
minority
made
an
obstinate
attempt
to
prevent
it
and
most
of
the
majority
had
little
heart
in
the
creation
of
a
single
gold
standard
the
banks
alone
and
the
dealers
in
exchange
insisted
upon
it
the
political
parties
divided
according
to
capitalistic
geographical
lines
senator
cameron
offering
almost
the
only
exception
but
they
mixed
with
unusual
and
made
liberal
allowance
for
each
others
actions
and
motives
the
struggle
was
rather
less
irritable
than
such
struggles
generally
were
and
it
ended
like
a
comedy
on
the
evening
of
the
final
vote
senator
cameron
came
back
from
the
capitol
with
senator
brice
senator
jones
senator
lodge
and
moreton
frewen
all
in
the
gayest
of
humors
as
though
they
were
rid
of
a
heavy
responsibility
adams
too
in
a
bystander
spirit
felt
light
in
mind
he
had
stood
up
for
his
eighteenth
century
his
constitution
of
his
george
washington
his
harvard
college
his
quincy
and
his
plymouth
pilgrims
as
long
as
any
one
would
stand
up
with
him
he
had
said
it
was
hopeless
twenty
years
before
but
he
had
kept
on
in
the
same
old
attitude
by
habit
and
taste
until
he
found
himself
altogether
alone
he
had
hugged
his
antiquated
dislike
of
bankers
and
capitalistic
society
until
he
had
become
little
better
than
a
crank
he
had
known
for
years
that
he
must
accept
the
regime
but
he
had
known
a
great
many
other
disagreeable
certainties
like
age
senility
and
death
against
which
one
made
what
little
resistance
one
could
the
matter
was
settled
at
last
by
the
people
for
a
hundred
years
between
and
the
american
people
had
hesitated
vacillated
swayed
forward
and
back
between
two
forces
one
simply
industrial
the
other
capitalistic
centralizing
and
mechanical
in
the
issue
came
on
the
single
gold
standard
and
the
majority
at
last
declared
itself
once
for
all
in
favor
of
the
capitalistic
system
with
all
its
necessary
machinery
all
one
friends
all
one
best
citizens
reformers
churches
colleges
educated
classes
had
joined
the
banks
to
force
submission
to
capitalism
a
submission
long
foreseen
by
the
mere
law
of
mass
of
all
forms
of
society
or
government
this
was
the
one
he
liked
least
but
his
likes
or
dislikes
were
as
antiquated
as
the
rebel
doctrine
of
state
rights
a
capitalistic
system
had
been
adopted
and
if
it
were
to
be
run
at
all
it
must
be
run
by
capital
and
by
capitalistic
methods
for
nothing
could
surpass
the
nonsensity
of
trying
to
run
so
complex
and
so
concentrated
a
machine
by
southern
and
western
farmers
in
grotesque
alliance
with
city
as
had
been
tried
in
and
and
had
failed
even
under
simple
conditions
there
education
in
domestic
politics
stopped
the
rest
was
question
of
gear
of
running
machinery
of
economy
and
involved
no
disputed
principle
once
admitted
that
the
machine
must
be
efficient
society
might
dispute
in
what
social
interest
it
should
be
run
but
in
any
case
it
must
work
concentration
such
great
revolutions
commonly
leave
some
bitterness
behind
but
nothing
in
politics
ever
surprised
henry
adams
more
than
the
ease
with
which
he
and
his
silver
friends
slipped
across
the
chasm
and
alighted
on
the
single
gold
standard
and
the
capitalistic
system
with
its
methods
the
protective
tariff
the
corporations
and
trusts
the
and
socialistic
paternalism
which
necessarily
made
their
complement
the
whole
mechanical
consolidation
of
force
which
ruthlessly
stamped
out
the
life
of
the
class
into
which
adams
was
born
but
created
monopolies
capable
of
controlling
the
new
energies
that
america
adored
society
rested
after
sweeping
into
the
these
cinders
of
a
misdirected
education
after
this
vigorous
impulse
nothing
remained
for
a
historian
but
to
ask
how
long
and
how
far
chapter
xxiii
silence
the
convulsion
of
left
its
victims
in
and
closed
much
education
while
the
country
braced
itself
up
to
an
effort
such
as
no
one
had
thought
within
its
powers
the
individual
crawled
as
he
best
could
through
the
wreck
and
found
many
values
of
life
upset
but
for
connecting
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
the
four
years
to
had
no
value
in
the
drama
of
education
and
might
be
left
out
much
that
had
made
life
pleasant
between
and
perished
in
the
ruin
and
among
the
earliest
wreckage
had
been
the
fortunes
of
clarence
king
the
lesson
taught
whatever
the
bystander
chose
to
read
in
it
but
to
adams
it
seemed
singularly
full
of
moral
if
he
could
but
understand
it
in
he
had
thought
king
education
ideal
and
his
personal
fitness
unrivalled
no
other
young
american
approached
him
for
the
combination
of
chances
physical
energy
social
standing
mental
scope
and
training
wit
geniality
and
science
that
seemed
superlatively
american
and
irresistibly
strong
his
nearest
rival
was
alexander
agassiz
and
as
far
as
their
friends
knew
no
one
else
could
be
classed
with
them
in
the
running
the
result
of
twenty
years
effort
proved
that
the
theory
of
scientific
education
failed
where
most
theory
fails
for
want
of
money
even
henry
adams
who
kept
himself
as
he
thought
quite
outside
of
every
possible
financial
risk
had
been
caught
in
the
cogs
and
held
for
months
over
the
gulf
of
bankruptcy
saved
only
by
the
chance
that
the
whole
class
of
millionaires
were
more
or
less
bankrupt
too
and
the
banks
were
forced
to
let
the
mice
escape
with
the
rats
but
in
sum
education
without
capital
could
always
be
taken
by
the
throat
and
forced
to
disgorge
its
gains
nor
was
it
helped
by
the
knowledge
that
no
one
intended
it
but
that
all
alike
suffered
whether
voluntary
or
mechanical
the
result
for
education
was
the
same
the
failure
of
the
scientific
scheme
without
money
to
back
it
was
flagrant
the
scientific
scheme
in
theory
was
alone
sound
for
science
should
be
equivalent
to
money
in
practice
science
was
helpless
without
money
the
weak
holder
was
in
his
own
language
sure
to
be
frozen
out
education
must
fit
the
complex
conditions
of
a
new
society
always
accelerating
its
movement
and
its
fitness
could
be
known
only
from
success
one
looked
about
for
examples
of
success
among
the
educated
of
one
time
the
men
born
in
the
thirties
and
trained
to
professions
within
one
immediate
acquaintance
three
were
typical
john
hay
whitelaw
reid
and
william
whitney
all
of
whom
owed
their
free
hand
to
marriage
education
serving
only
for
ornament
but
among
whom
in
william
whitney
was
far
and
away
the
most
popular
type
newspapers
might
prate
about
wealth
till
commonplace
print
was
exhausted
but
as
matter
of
habit
few
americans
envied
the
very
rich
for
anything
the
most
of
them
got
out
of
money
new
york
might
occasionally
fear
them
but
more
often
laughed
or
sneered
at
them
and
never
showed
them
respect
scarcely
one
of
the
very
rich
men
held
any
position
in
society
by
virtue
of
his
wealth
or
could
have
been
elected
to
an
office
or
even
into
a
good
club
setting
aside
the
few
like
pierpont
morgan
whose
social
position
had
little
to
do
with
greater
or
less
wealth
riches
were
in
new
york
no
object
of
envy
on
account
of
the
joys
they
brought
in
their
train
and
whitney
was
not
even
one
of
the
very
rich
yet
in
his
case
the
envy
was
palpable
there
was
reason
for
it
already
in
whitney
had
finished
with
politics
after
having
gratified
every
ambition
and
swung
the
country
almost
at
his
will
he
had
thrown
away
the
usual
objects
of
political
ambition
like
the
ashes
of
smoked
cigarettes
had
turned
to
other
amusements
satiated
every
taste
gorged
every
appetite
won
every
object
that
new
york
afforded
and
not
yet
satisfied
had
carried
his
field
of
activity
abroad
until
new
york
no
longer
knew
what
most
to
envy
his
horses
or
his
houses
he
had
succeeded
precisely
where
clarence
king
had
failed
barely
forty
years
had
passed
since
all
these
men
started
in
a
bunch
to
race
for
power
and
the
results
were
fixed
beyond
reversal
but
one
knew
no
better
in
than
in
what
an
american
education
ought
to
be
in
order
to
count
as
success
even
granting
that
it
counted
as
money
its
value
could
not
be
called
general
america
contained
scores
of
men
worth
five
millions
or
upwards
whose
lives
were
no
more
worth
living
than
those
of
their
cooks
and
to
whom
the
task
of
making
money
equivalent
to
education
offered
more
difficulties
than
to
adams
the
task
of
making
education
equivalent
to
money
social
position
seemed
to
have
value
still
while
education
counted
for
nothing
a
mathematician
linguist
chemist
electrician
engineer
if
fortunate
might
average
a
value
of
ten
dollars
a
day
in
the
open
market
an
administrator
organizer
manager
with
mediaeval
qualities
of
energy
and
will
but
no
education
beyond
his
special
branch
would
probably
be
worth
at
least
ten
times
as
much
society
had
failed
to
discover
what
sort
of
education
suited
it
best
wealth
valued
social
position
and
classical
education
as
highly
as
either
of
these
valued
wealth
and
the
women
still
tended
to
keep
the
scales
even
for
anything
adams
could
see
he
was
himself
as
contented
as
though
he
had
been
educated
while
clarence
king
whose
education
was
exactly
suited
to
theory
had
failed
and
whitney
who
was
no
better
educated
than
adams
had
achieved
phenomenal
success
had
adams
in
been
starting
in
life
as
he
did
in
he
must
have
repeated
that
all
he
asked
of
education
was
the
facile
use
of
the
four
old
tools
mathematics
french
german
and
spanish
with
these
he
could
still
make
his
way
to
any
object
within
his
vision
and
would
have
a
decisive
advantage
over
nine
rivals
in
ten
statesman
or
lawyer
chemist
or
electrician
priest
or
professor
native
or
foreign
he
would
fear
none
king
breakdown
physical
as
well
as
financial
brought
the
indirect
gain
to
adams
that
on
recovering
strength
king
induced
him
to
go
to
cuba
where
in
january
they
drifted
into
the
little
town
of
santiago
the
picturesque
cuban
society
which
king
knew
well
was
more
amusing
than
any
other
that
one
had
yet
discovered
in
the
whole
broad
world
but
made
no
profession
of
teaching
anything
unless
it
were
cuban
spanish
or
the
danza
and
neither
on
his
own
nor
on
king
account
did
the
visitor
ask
any
loftier
study
than
that
of
the
buzzards
floating
on
the
down
the
valley
to
dos
bocas
or
the
colors
of
sea
and
shore
at
sunrise
from
the
height
of
the
gran
piedra
but
as
though
they
were
still
twenty
years
old
and
revolution
were
as
young
as
they
the
decaying
fabric
which
had
never
been
solid
fell
on
their
heads
and
drew
them
with
it
into
an
ocean
of
mischief
in
the
between
and
empires
were
always
falling
on
one
head
and
of
all
lessons
these
constant
political
convulsions
taught
least
since
the
time
of
rameses
revolutions
have
raised
more
doubts
than
they
solved
but
they
have
sometimes
the
merit
of
changing
one
point
of
view
and
the
cuban
rebellion
served
to
sever
the
last
tie
that
attached
adams
to
a
democratic
administration
he
thought
that
president
cleveland
could
have
settled
the
cuban
question
without
war
had
he
chosen
to
do
his
duty
and
this
feeling
generally
held
by
the
democratic
party
joined
with
the
stress
of
economical
needs
and
the
gold
standard
to
break
into
bits
the
old
organization
and
to
leave
no
choice
between
parties
the
new
american
whether
consciously
or
not
had
turned
his
back
on
the
nineteenth
century
before
he
was
done
with
it
the
gold
standard
the
protective
system
and
the
laws
of
mass
could
have
no
other
outcome
and
as
so
often
before
the
movement
once
accelerated
by
attempting
to
impede
it
had
the
additional
brutal
consequence
of
crushing
equally
the
good
and
the
bad
that
stood
in
its
way
the
lesson
was
old
so
old
that
it
became
tedious
one
had
studied
nothing
else
since
childhood
and
wearied
of
it
for
yet
another
year
adams
lingered
on
these
outskirts
of
the
vortex
among
the
picturesque
primitive
types
of
a
world
which
had
never
been
fairly
involved
in
the
general
motion
and
were
the
more
amusing
for
their
torpor
after
passing
the
winter
with
king
in
the
west
indies
he
passed
the
summer
with
hay
in
the
yellowstone
and
found
there
little
to
study
the
geysers
were
an
old
story
the
snake
river
posed
no
vital
statistics
except
in
its
fordings
even
the
tetons
were
as
calm
as
they
were
lovely
while
the
wapiti
and
bear
innocent
of
strikes
and
corners
laid
no
traps
in
return
the
party
treated
them
with
affection
never
did
a
band
less
bloody
or
bloodthirsty
wander
over
the
roof
of
the
continent
hay
loved
as
little
as
adams
did
the
labor
of
skinning
and
butchering
big
game
he
had
even
outgrown
the
sedate
meditative
joy
of
and
found
the
trout
of
the
yellowstone
too
easy
a
prey
hallett
phillips
himself
who
managed
the
party
loved
to
play
indian
hunter
without
hunting
so
much
as
a
fieldmouse
iddings
the
geologist
was
reduced
to
shooting
only
for
the
table
and
the
guileless
prattle
of
billy
hofer
alone
taught
the
simple
life
compared
with
the
rockies
of
the
sense
of
wildness
had
vanished
one
saw
no
possible
adventures
except
to
break
one
neck
as
in
chasing
an
aniseed
fox
only
the
more
intelligent
ponies
scented
an
occasional
friendly
and
sociable
bear
when
the
party
came
out
of
the
yellowstone
adams
went
on
alone
to
seattle
and
vancouver
to
inspect
the
last
american
railway
systems
yet
untried
they
too
offered
little
new
learning
and
no
sooner
had
he
finished
this
debauch
of
northwestern
geography
than
with
desperate
thirst
for
exhausting
the
american
field
he
set
out
for
mexico
and
the
gulf
making
a
sweep
of
the
caribbean
and
clearing
up
in
these
six
or
eight
months
at
least
twenty
thousand
miles
of
american
land
and
water
he
was
beginning
to
think
when
he
got
back
to
washington
in
april
that
he
knew
enough
about
the
edges
of
life
tropical
islands
mountain
solitudes
archaic
law
and
retrograde
types
infinitely
more
amusing
and
incomparably
more
picturesque
than
civilization
they
educated
only
artists
and
as
one
sixtieth
year
approached
the
artist
began
to
die
only
a
certain
intense
cerebral
restlessness
survived
which
no
longer
responded
to
sensual
stimulants
one
was
driven
from
beauty
to
beauty
as
though
art
were
a
for
this
one
was
in
some
degree
prepared
for
the
old
man
had
been
a
since
drama
began
but
one
felt
some
perplexity
to
account
for
failure
on
the
opposite
or
mechanical
side
where
nothing
but
cerebral
action
was
needed
taking
for
granted
that
the
alternative
to
art
was
arithmetic
he
plunged
deep
into
statistics
fancying
that
education
would
find
the
surest
bottom
there
and
the
study
proved
the
easiest
he
had
ever
approached
even
the
government
volunteered
unlimited
statistics
endless
columns
of
figures
bottomless
averages
merely
for
the
asking
at
the
statistical
bureau
worthington
ford
supplied
any
material
that
curiosity
could
imagine
for
filling
the
vast
gaps
of
ignorance
and
methods
for
applying
the
plasters
of
fact
one
seemed
for
a
while
to
be
winning
ground
and
one
averages
projected
themselves
as
laws
into
the
future
perhaps
the
most
perplexing
part
of
the
study
lay
in
the
attitude
of
the
statisticians
who
showed
no
enthusiastic
confidence
in
their
own
figures
they
should
have
reached
certainty
but
they
talked
like
other
men
who
knew
less
the
method
did
not
result
in
faith
indeed
every
increase
of
mass
of
volume
and
velocity
seemed
to
bring
in
new
elements
and
at
last
a
scholar
fresh
in
arithmetic
and
ignorant
of
algebra
fell
into
a
superstitious
terror
of
complexity
as
the
sink
of
facts
nothing
came
out
as
it
should
in
principle
according
to
figures
any
one
could
set
up
or
pull
down
a
society
one
could
frame
no
sort
of
satisfactory
answer
to
the
constructive
doctrines
of
adam
smith
or
to
the
destructive
criticisms
of
karl
marx
or
to
the
anarchistic
imprecations
of
elisee
reclus
one
revelled
at
will
in
the
ruin
of
every
society
in
the
past
and
rejoiced
in
proving
the
prospective
overthrow
of
every
society
that
seemed
possible
in
the
future
but
meanwhile
these
societies
which
violated
every
law
moral
arithmetical
and
economical
not
only
propagated
each
other
but
produced
also
fresh
complexities
with
every
propagation
and
developed
mass
with
every
complexity
the
human
factor
was
worse
still
since
the
stupefying
discovery
of
pteraspis
in
nothing
had
so
confused
the
student
as
the
conduct
of
mankind
in
the
no
one
seemed
very
much
concerned
about
this
world
or
the
future
unless
it
might
be
the
anarchists
and
they
only
because
they
disliked
the
present
adams
disliked
the
present
as
much
as
they
did
and
his
interest
in
future
society
was
becoming
slight
yet
he
was
kept
alive
by
irritation
at
finding
his
life
so
thin
and
fruitless
meanwhile
he
watched
mankind
march
on
like
a
train
of
on
the
snake
river
tumbling
from
one
morass
into
another
and
at
short
intervals
for
no
reason
but
temper
falling
to
butchery
like
cain
since
massacres
had
become
so
common
that
society
scarcely
noticed
them
unless
they
summed
up
hundreds
of
thousands
as
in
armenia
wars
had
been
almost
continuous
and
were
beginning
again
in
cuba
threatening
in
south
africa
and
possible
in
manchuria
yet
impartial
judges
thought
them
all
not
merely
unnecessary
but
foolish
induced
by
greed
of
the
coarsest
class
as
though
the
pharaohs
or
the
romans
were
still
robbing
their
neighbors
the
robbery
might
be
natural
and
inevitable
but
the
murder
seemed
altogether
archaic
at
one
moment
of
perplexity
to
account
for
this
trait
of
pteraspis
or
shark
which
seemed
to
have
survived
every
moral
improvement
of
society
he
took
to
study
of
the
religious
press
possibly
growth
in
human
nature
might
show
itself
there
he
found
no
need
to
speak
unkindly
of
it
but
as
an
agent
of
motion
he
preferred
on
the
whole
the
vigor
of
the
shark
with
its
chances
of
betterment
and
he
very
gravely
doubted
from
his
aching
consciousness
of
religious
void
whether
any
large
fraction
of
society
cared
for
a
future
life
or
even
for
the
present
one
thirty
years
hence
not
an
act
or
an
expression
or
an
image
showed
depth
of
faith
or
hope
the
object
of
education
therefore
was
changed
for
many
years
it
had
lost
itself
in
studying
what
the
world
had
ceased
to
care
for
if
it
were
to
begin
again
it
must
try
to
find
out
what
the
mass
of
mankind
did
care
for
and
why
religion
politics
statistics
travel
had
thus
far
led
to
nothing
even
the
chicago
fair
had
only
confused
the
roads
accidental
education
could
go
no
further
for
one
mind
was
already
littered
and
stuffed
beyond
hope
with
the
millions
of
chance
images
stored
away
without
order
in
the
memory
one
might
as
well
try
to
educate
a
the
task
was
futile
which
disturbed
a
student
less
than
the
discovery
that
in
pursuing
it
he
was
becoming
himself
ridiculous
nothing
is
more
tiresome
than
a
superannuated
pedagogue
for
the
moment
he
was
rescued
as
often
before
by
a
woman
towards
midsummer
cabot
lodge
bade
him
follow
her
to
europe
with
the
senator
and
her
two
sons
the
study
of
history
is
useful
to
the
historian
by
teaching
him
his
ignorance
of
women
and
the
mass
of
this
ignorance
crushes
one
who
is
familiar
enough
with
what
are
called
historical
sources
to
realize
how
few
women
have
ever
been
known
the
woman
who
is
known
only
through
a
man
is
known
wrong
and
excepting
one
or
two
like
mme
de
sevigne
no
woman
has
pictured
herself
the
american
woman
of
the
nineteenth
century
will
live
only
as
the
man
saw
her
probably
she
will
be
less
known
than
the
woman
of
the
eighteenth
none
of
the
female
descendants
of
abigail
adams
can
ever
be
nearly
so
familiar
as
her
letters
have
made
her
and
all
this
is
pure
loss
to
history
for
the
american
woman
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
much
better
company
than
the
american
man
she
was
probably
much
better
company
than
her
grandmothers
with
lodge
and
her
husband
senator
since
adams
relations
had
been
those
of
elder
brother
or
uncle
since
when
cabot
lodge
had
left
his
on
assistant
professor
adams
desk
and
crossed
the
street
to
christ
church
in
cambridge
to
get
married
with
lodge
himself
as
scholar
fellow
instructor
of
the
north
american
review
and
political
reformer
from
to
he
had
worked
intimately
but
with
him
afterwards
as
politician
he
had
not
much
relation
and
since
lodge
had
suffered
what
adams
thought
the
misfortune
of
becoming
not
only
a
senator
but
a
senator
from
massachusetts
a
singular
social
relation
which
adams
had
known
only
as
fatal
to
friends
a
superstitious
student
intimate
with
the
laws
of
historical
fatality
would
rather
have
recognized
him
only
as
an
enemy
but
apart
from
this
accident
he
valued
lodge
highly
and
in
the
waste
places
of
average
humanity
had
been
greatly
dependent
on
his
house
senators
can
never
be
approached
with
safety
but
a
senator
who
has
a
very
superior
wife
and
several
superior
children
who
feel
no
deference
for
senators
as
such
may
be
approached
at
times
with
relative
impunity
while
they
keep
him
under
restraint
where
lodge
summoned
one
followed
with
gratitude
and
so
it
chanced
that
in
august
one
found
one
self
for
the
first
time
at
caen
coutances
and
in
normandy
if
history
had
a
chapter
with
which
he
thought
himself
familiar
it
was
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
yet
so
little
has
labor
to
do
with
knowledge
that
these
bare
playgrounds
of
the
lecture
system
turned
into
green
and
verdurous
virgin
forests
merely
through
the
medium
of
younger
eyes
and
fresher
minds
his
german
bias
must
have
given
his
youth
a
terrible
twist
for
the
lodges
saw
at
a
glance
what
he
had
thought
unessential
because
they
breathed
native
air
in
the
normandy
of
a
compliment
which
would
have
seemed
to
the
senator
lacking
in
taste
or
even
in
sense
when
addressed
to
one
of
a
class
of
men
who
passed
life
in
trying
to
persuade
themselves
and
the
public
that
they
breathed
nothing
less
american
than
a
blizzard
but
this
atmosphere
in
the
touch
of
a
real
emotion
betrayed
the
unconscious
humor
of
the
senatorial
mind
in
the
thirteenth
century
by
an
unusual
chance
even
a
senator
became
natural
simple
interested
cultivated
artistic
liberal
genial
through
the
lodge
eyes
the
old
problem
became
new
and
personal
it
threw
off
all
association
with
the
german
one
could
not
at
first
see
what
this
novelty
meant
it
had
the
air
of
mere
antiquarian
emotion
like
wenlock
abbey
and
pteraspis
but
it
expelled
archaic
law
and
antiquarianism
once
for
all
without
seeming
conscious
of
it
and
adams
drifted
back
to
washington
with
a
new
sense
of
history
again
he
wandered
south
and
in
april
returned
to
mexico
with
the
camerons
to
study
the
charms
of
pulque
and
churriguerresque
architecture
in
may
he
ran
through
europe
again
with
hay
as
far
south
as
ravenna
there
came
the
end
of
the
passage
after
thus
covering
once
more
in
many
thousand
miles
of
the
old
trails
adams
went
home
in
october
with
every
one
else
to
elect
mckinley
president
and
start
the
world
anew
for
the
old
world
of
public
men
and
measures
since
adams
wept
no
tears
within
or
without
during
or
after
it
as
partisan
or
historian
he
never
saw
anything
to
admire
in
it
or
anything
he
wanted
to
save
and
in
this
respect
he
reflected
only
the
public
mind
which
balanced
itself
so
exactly
between
the
unpopularity
of
both
parties
as
to
express
no
sympathy
with
either
even
among
the
most
powerful
men
of
that
generation
he
knew
none
who
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
it
no
period
so
thoroughly
ordinary
had
been
known
in
american
politics
since
christopher
columbus
first
disturbed
the
balance
of
american
society
but
the
natural
result
of
such
lack
of
interest
in
public
affairs
in
a
small
society
like
that
of
washington
led
an
idle
bystander
to
depend
abjectly
on
intimacy
of
private
relation
one
dragged
one
self
down
the
long
vista
of
pennsylvania
avenue
by
leaning
heavily
on
friends
and
avoiding
to
look
at
anything
else
thus
life
had
grown
narrow
with
years
more
and
more
concentrated
on
the
circle
of
houses
round
la
fayette
square
which
had
no
direct
or
personal
share
in
power
except
in
the
case
of
blaine
whose
tumultuous
struggle
for
existence
held
him
apart
suddenly
mckinley
entered
the
white
house
and
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
this
special
group
in
a
moment
the
whole
nest
so
slowly
constructed
was
torn
to
pieces
and
scattered
over
the
world
adams
found
himself
alone
john
hay
took
his
orders
for
london
rockhill
departed
to
athens
cecil
had
been
buried
in
persia
cameron
refused
to
remain
in
public
life
either
at
home
or
abroad
and
broke
up
his
house
on
the
square
only
the
lodges
and
roosevelts
remained
but
even
they
were
at
once
absorbed
in
the
interests
of
power
since
no
such
social
convulsion
had
occurred
even
this
was
not
quite
the
worst
to
one
whose
interests
lay
chiefly
in
foreign
affairs
and
who
at
this
moment
felt
most
strongly
the
nightmare
of
cuban
hawaiian
and
nicaraguan
chaos
the
man
in
the
state
department
seemed
more
important
than
the
man
in
the
white
house
adams
knew
no
one
in
the
united
states
fit
to
manage
these
matters
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
europe
and
had
no
candidate
to
propose
but
he
was
shocked
beyond
all
restraints
of
expression
to
learn
that
the
president
meant
to
put
senator
john
sherman
in
the
state
department
in
order
to
make
a
place
for
hanna
in
the
senate
grant
himself
had
done
nothing
that
seemed
so
bad
as
this
to
one
who
had
lived
long
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
ways
of
presidential
jobbery
if
not
between
the
jobs
john
sherman
otherwise
admirably
fitted
for
the
place
a
friendly
influence
for
nearly
forty
years
was
notoriously
feeble
and
quite
senile
so
that
the
intrigue
seemed
to
adams
the
betrayal
of
an
old
friend
as
well
as
of
the
state
department
one
might
have
shrugged
one
shoulders
had
the
president
named
hanna
his
secretary
of
state
for
hanna
was
a
man
of
force
if
not
of
experience
and
selections
much
worse
than
this
had
often
turned
out
well
enough
but
john
sherman
must
inevitably
and
tragically
break
down
the
prospect
for
once
was
not
less
vile
than
the
men
one
can
bear
coldly
the
jobbery
of
enemies
but
not
that
of
friends
and
to
adams
this
kind
of
jobbery
seemed
always
infinitely
worse
than
all
the
petty
money
bribes
ever
exploited
by
the
newspapers
nor
was
the
matter
improved
by
hints
that
the
president
might
call
john
hay
to
the
department
whenever
john
sherman
should
retire
indeed
had
hay
been
even
unconsciously
party
to
such
an
intrigue
he
would
have
put
an
end
once
for
all
to
further
concern
in
public
affairs
on
his
part
but
even
without
this
last
disaster
one
felt
that
washington
had
become
no
longer
habitable
nothing
was
left
there
but
solitary
contemplation
of
mckinley
ways
which
were
not
likely
to
be
more
amusing
than
the
ways
of
his
predecessors
or
of
senatorial
ways
which
offered
no
novelty
of
what
the
french
language
expressively
calls
embetement
or
of
poor
sherman
ways
which
would
surely
cause
anguish
to
his
friends
once
more
one
must
go
nothing
was
easier
on
and
off
one
had
done
the
same
thing
since
the
year
at
frequent
intervals
and
had
now
reached
the
month
of
march
yet
as
the
whole
result
of
six
years
dogged
effort
to
begin
a
new
education
one
could
not
recommend
it
to
the
young
the
outlook
lacked
hope
the
object
of
travel
had
become
more
and
more
dim
ever
since
the
gibbering
ghost
of
the
civil
law
had
been
locked
in
its
dark
closet
as
far
back
as
noah
dove
had
not
searched
the
earth
for
so
carefully
or
with
so
little
success
any
spot
on
land
or
water
satisfies
a
dove
who
wants
and
finds
rest
but
no
perch
suits
a
dove
of
sixty
years
old
alone
and
uneducated
who
has
lost
his
taste
even
for
olives
to
this
also
the
young
may
be
driven
as
education
and
the
lesson
fails
in
humor
but
it
may
be
worth
knowing
to
some
of
them
that
the
planet
offers
hardly
a
dozen
places
where
an
elderly
man
can
pass
a
week
alone
without
ennui
and
none
at
all
where
he
can
pass
a
year
irritated
by
such
complaints
the
world
naturally
answers
that
no
man
of
sixty
should
live
which
is
doubtless
true
though
not
original
the
man
of
sixty
with
a
certain
irritability
proper
to
his
years
retorts
that
the
world
has
no
business
to
throw
on
him
the
task
of
removing
its
carrion
and
that
while
he
remains
he
has
a
right
to
require
amusement
or
at
least
education
since
this
costs
nothing
to
any
one
and
that
a
world
which
can
not
educate
will
not
amuse
and
is
ugly
besides
has
even
less
right
to
exist
than
he
both
views
seem
sound
but
the
world
wearily
objects
to
be
called
by
epithets
what
society
always
admits
in
practice
for
no
one
likes
to
be
told
that
he
is
a
bore
or
ignorant
or
even
ugly
and
having
nothing
to
say
in
its
defence
it
rejoins
that
whatever
license
is
pardonable
in
youth
the
man
of
sixty
who
wishes
consideration
had
better
hold
his
tongue
this
truth
also
has
the
defect
of
being
too
true
the
rule
holds
equally
for
men
of
half
that
age
only
the
very
young
have
the
right
to
betray
their
ignorance
or
elderly
people
commonly
know
enough
not
to
betray
themselves
exceptions
are
plenty
on
both
sides
as
the
senate
knew
to
its
acute
suffering
but
young
or
old
women
or
men
seemed
agreed
on
one
point
with
singular
unanimity
each
praised
silence
in
others
of
all
characteristics
in
human
nature
this
has
been
one
of
the
most
abiding
mere
superficial
gleaning
of
what
in
the
long
history
of
human
expression
has
been
said
by
the
fool
or
unsaid
by
the
wise
shows
that
for
once
no
difference
of
opinion
has
ever
existed
on
this
even
a
fool
said
the
wisest
of
men
when
he
holdeth
his
peace
is
counted
wise
and
still
more
often
the
wisest
of
men
when
he
spoke
the
highest
wisdom
has
been
counted
a
fool
they
agreed
only
on
the
merits
of
silence
in
others
socrates
made
remarks
in
its
favor
which
should
have
struck
the
athenians
as
new
to
them
but
of
late
the
repetition
had
grown
tiresome
thomas
carlyle
vociferated
his
admiration
of
it
matthew
arnold
thought
it
the
best
form
of
expression
and
adams
thought
matthew
arnold
the
best
form
of
expression
in
his
time
algernon
swinburne
called
it
the
most
noble
to
the
end
alfred
de
vigny
dying
wolf
remarked
a
voir
ce
que
fut
sur
terre
et
ce
laisse
seul
le
silence
est
grand
tout
le
reste
est
faiblesse
when
one
thinks
what
one
leaves
in
the
world
when
one
dies
only
silence
is
strong
all
the
rest
is
but
lies
even
byron
whom
a
more
brilliant
era
of
genius
seemed
to
have
decided
to
be
but
an
indifferent
poet
had
ventured
to
affirm
that
the
alp
snow
summit
nearer
heaven
is
seen
than
the
volcano
fierce
eruptive
crest
with
other
verses
to
the
effect
that
words
are
but
a
temporary
torturing
flame
of
which
no
one
knew
more
than
himself
the
evidence
of
the
poets
could
not
be
more
emphatic
silent
while
years
engrave
the
brow
silent
the
best
are
silent
now
although
none
of
these
great
geniuses
had
shown
faith
in
silence
as
a
cure
for
their
own
ills
or
ignorance
all
of
them
and
all
philosophy
after
them
affirmed
that
no
man
even
at
sixty
had
ever
been
known
to
attain
knowledge
but
that
a
very
few
were
believed
to
have
attained
ignorance
which
was
in
result
the
same
more
than
this
in
every
society
worth
the
name
the
man
of
sixty
had
been
encouraged
to
ride
this
hobby
the
pursuit
of
ignorance
in
silence
as
though
it
were
the
easiest
way
to
get
rid
of
him
in
america
the
silence
was
more
oppressive
than
the
ignorance
but
perhaps
elsewhere
the
world
might
still
hide
some
haunt
of
futilitarian
silence
where
content
reigned
although
long
search
had
not
revealed
it
and
so
the
pilgrimage
began
anew
the
first
step
led
to
london
where
john
hay
was
to
be
established
one
had
seen
so
many
american
ministers
received
in
london
that
the
lord
chamberlain
himself
scarcely
knew
more
about
it
education
could
not
be
expected
there
but
there
adams
arrived
april
as
though
years
were
so
many
days
for
queen
victoria
still
reigned
and
one
saw
little
change
in
james
street
true
carlton
house
terrace
like
the
streets
of
rome
actually
squeaked
and
gibbered
with
ghosts
till
one
felt
like
odysseus
before
the
press
of
shadows
daunted
by
a
bloodless
fear
but
in
spring
london
is
pleasant
and
it
was
more
cheery
than
ever
in
may
when
every
one
was
welcoming
the
return
of
life
after
the
long
winter
since
one
fortunes
or
one
friends
fortunes
were
again
in
flood
this
amusement
could
not
be
prolonged
for
one
found
one
self
the
oldest
englishman
in
england
much
too
familiar
with
family
jars
better
forgotten
and
old
traditions
better
unknown
no
wrinkled
tannhauser
returning
to
the
wartburg
needed
a
wrinkled
venus
to
show
him
that
he
was
no
longer
at
home
and
that
even
penitence
was
a
sort
of
impertinence
he
slipped
away
to
paris
and
set
up
a
household
at
germain
where
he
taught
and
learned
french
history
for
nieces
who
swarmed
under
the
venerable
cedars
of
the
pavillon
and
rode
about
the
green
of
germain
and
marly
from
time
to
time
hay
wrote
humorous
laments
but
nothing
occurred
to
break
the
of
the
stranded
tannhauser
who
slowly
began
to
feel
at
home
in
france
as
in
other
countries
he
had
thought
more
homelike
at
length
like
other
dead
americans
he
went
to
paris
because
he
could
go
nowhere
else
and
lingered
there
till
the
hays
came
by
in
january
and
hay
who
had
been
a
stanch
and
strong
ally
for
twenty
years
bade
him
go
with
them
to
egypt
adams
cared
little
to
see
egypt
again
but
he
was
glad
to
see
hay
and
readily
drifted
after
him
to
the
nile
what
they
saw
and
what
they
said
had
as
little
to
do
with
education
as
possible
until
one
evening
as
they
were
looking
at
the
sun
set
across
the
nile
from
assouan
spencer
eddy
brought
them
a
telegram
to
announce
the
sinking
of
the
maine
in
havana
harbor
this
was
the
greatest
stride
in
education
since
but
what
did
it
teach
one
leant
on
a
fragment
of
column
in
the
great
hall
at
karnak
and
watched
a
jackal
creep
down
the
debris
of
ruin
the
jackal
ancestors
had
surely
crept
up
the
same
wall
when
it
was
building
what
was
his
view
about
the
value
of
silence
one
lay
in
the
sands
and
watched
the
expression
of
the
sphinx
brooks
adams
had
taught
him
that
the
relation
between
civilizations
was
that
of
trade
henry
wandered
or
was
down
the
coast
he
tried
to
trace
out
the
ancient
harbor
of
ephesus
he
went
over
to
athens
picked
up
rockhill
and
searched
for
the
harbor
of
tiryns
together
they
went
on
to
constantinople
and
studied
the
great
walls
of
constantine
and
the
greater
domes
of
justinian
his
hobby
had
turned
into
a
camel
and
he
hoped
if
he
rode
long
enough
in
silence
that
at
last
he
might
come
on
a
city
of
thought
along
the
great
highways
of
exchange
chapter
xxiv
indian
summer
the
summer
of
the
spanish
war
began
the
indian
summer
of
life
to
one
who
had
reached
sixty
years
of
age
and
cared
only
to
reap
in
peace
such
harvest
as
these
sixty
years
had
yielded
he
had
reason
to
be
more
than
content
with
it
since
he
had
felt
no
such
sense
of
power
and
momentum
and
had
seen
no
such
number
of
personal
friends
wielding
it
the
sense
of
solidarity
counts
for
much
in
contentment
but
the
sense
of
winning
one
game
counts
for
more
and
in
london
in
the
scene
was
singularly
interesting
to
the
last
survivor
of
the
legation
of
he
thought
himself
perhaps
the
only
person
living
who
could
get
full
enjoyment
of
the
drama
he
carried
every
scene
of
it
in
a
century
and
a
half
since
the
stamp
act
quite
alive
in
his
mind
all
the
interminable
disputes
of
his
disputatious
ancestors
as
far
back
as
the
year
as
well
as
his
own
insignificance
in
the
civil
war
every
step
in
which
had
the
object
of
bringing
england
into
an
american
system
for
this
they
had
written
libraries
of
argument
and
remonstrance
and
had
piled
war
on
war
losing
their
tempers
for
life
and
souring
the
gentle
and
patient
puritan
nature
of
their
descendants
until
even
their
private
secretaries
at
times
used
language
almost
intemperate
and
suddenly
by
pure
chance
the
blessing
fell
on
hay
after
two
hundred
years
of
stupid
and
greedy
blundering
which
no
argument
and
no
violence
affected
the
people
of
england
learned
their
lesson
just
at
the
moment
when
hay
would
otherwise
have
faced
a
flood
of
the
old
anxieties
hay
himself
scarcely
knew
how
grateful
he
should
be
for
to
him
the
change
came
almost
of
course
he
saw
only
the
necessary
stages
that
had
led
to
it
and
to
him
they
seemed
natural
but
to
adams
still
living
in
the
atmosphere
of
palmerston
and
john
russell
the
sudden
appearance
of
germany
as
the
grizzly
terror
which
in
twenty
years
effected
what
adamses
had
tried
for
two
hundred
in
vain
frightened
england
into
america
arms
seemed
as
melodramatic
as
any
plot
of
napoleon
the
great
he
could
feel
only
the
sense
of
satisfaction
at
seeing
the
diplomatic
triumph
of
all
his
family
since
the
breed
existed
at
last
realized
under
his
own
eyes
for
the
advantage
of
his
oldest
and
closest
ally
this
was
history
not
education
yet
it
taught
something
exceedingly
serious
if
not
ultimate
could
one
trust
the
lesson
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
a
sense
of
possible
purpose
working
itself
out
in
history
probably
no
one
else
on
this
earthly
planet
not
even
hay
could
have
come
out
on
precisely
such
extreme
personal
satisfaction
but
as
he
sat
at
hay
table
listening
to
any
member
of
the
british
cabinet
for
all
were
alike
now
discuss
the
philippines
as
a
question
of
balance
of
power
in
the
east
he
could
see
that
the
family
work
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
fell
at
once
into
the
grand
perspective
of
true
which
hay
work
set
off
with
artistic
skill
the
roughness
of
the
archaic
foundations
looked
stronger
and
larger
in
scale
for
the
refinement
and
certainty
of
the
arcade
in
the
long
list
of
famous
american
ministers
in
london
none
could
have
given
the
work
quite
the
completeness
the
harmony
the
perfect
ease
of
hay
never
before
had
adams
been
able
to
discern
the
working
of
law
in
history
which
was
the
reason
of
his
failure
in
teaching
it
for
chaos
can
not
be
taught
but
he
thought
he
had
a
personal
property
by
inheritance
in
this
proof
of
sequence
and
intelligence
in
the
affairs
of
man
a
property
which
no
one
else
had
right
to
dispute
and
this
personal
triumph
left
him
a
little
cold
towards
the
other
diplomatic
results
of
the
war
he
knew
that
porto
rico
must
be
taken
but
he
would
have
been
glad
to
escape
the
philippines
apart
from
too
intimate
an
acquaintance
with
the
value
of
islands
in
the
south
seas
he
knew
the
west
indies
well
enough
to
be
assured
that
whatever
the
american
people
might
think
or
say
about
it
they
would
sooner
or
later
have
to
police
those
islands
not
against
europe
but
for
europe
and
america
too
education
on
the
outskirts
of
civilized
life
teaches
not
very
much
but
it
taught
this
and
one
felt
no
call
to
shoulder
the
load
of
archipelagoes
in
the
antipodes
when
one
was
trying
painfully
to
pluck
up
courage
to
face
the
labor
of
shouldering
archipelagoes
at
home
the
country
decided
otherwise
and
one
acquiesced
readily
enough
since
the
matter
concerned
only
the
public
willingness
to
carry
loads
in
london
the
balance
of
power
in
the
east
came
alone
into
discussion
and
in
every
point
of
view
one
had
as
much
reason
to
be
gratified
with
the
result
as
though
one
had
shared
in
the
danger
instead
of
being
vigorously
employed
in
looking
on
from
a
great
distance
after
all
friends
had
done
the
work
if
not
one
self
and
he
too
serves
a
certain
purpose
who
only
stands
and
cheers
in
june
at
the
crisis
of
interest
the
camerons
came
over
and
took
the
fine
old
house
of
surrenden
dering
in
kent
which
they
made
a
sort
of
country
house
to
the
embassy
kent
has
charms
rivalling
those
of
shropshire
and
even
compared
with
the
many
beautiful
places
scattered
along
the
welsh
border
few
are
nobler
or
more
genial
than
surrenden
with
its
unbroken
descent
from
the
saxons
its
avenues
its
terraces
its
its
large
repose
on
the
kentish
hillside
and
its
broad
outlook
over
what
was
once
the
forest
of
anderida
filled
with
a
constant
stream
of
guests
the
house
seemed
to
wait
for
the
chance
to
show
its
charms
to
the
american
with
whose
activity
the
whole
world
was
resounding
and
never
since
the
battle
of
hastings
could
the
little
telegraph
office
of
the
kentish
village
have
done
such
work
there
on
a
hot
july
to
an
expectant
group
under
the
shady
trees
came
the
telegram
announcing
the
destruction
of
the
spanish
armada
as
it
might
have
come
to
queen
elizabeth
in
and
there
later
in
the
season
came
the
order
summoning
hay
to
the
state
department
hay
had
no
wish
to
be
secretary
of
state
he
much
preferred
to
remain
ambassador
and
his
friends
were
quite
as
cold
about
it
as
he
no
one
knew
so
well
what
sort
of
strain
falls
on
secretaries
of
state
or
how
little
strength
he
had
in
reserve
against
it
even
at
surrenden
he
showed
none
too
much
endurance
and
he
would
gladly
have
found
a
valid
excuse
for
refusing
the
discussion
on
both
sides
was
earnest
but
the
decided
voice
of
the
conclave
was
that
though
if
he
were
a
mere
he
might
certainly
decline
promotion
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
government
he
could
not
no
serious
statesman
could
accept
a
favor
and
refuse
a
service
doubtless
he
might
refuse
but
in
that
case
he
must
resign
the
amusement
of
making
presidents
has
keen
fascination
for
idle
american
hands
but
these
black
arts
have
the
old
drawback
of
all
deviltry
one
must
serve
the
spirit
one
evokes
even
though
the
service
were
perdition
to
body
and
soul
for
him
no
doubt
the
service
though
hard
might
bring
some
share
of
profit
but
for
the
friends
who
gave
this
unselfish
decision
all
would
prove
loss
for
one
adams
on
that
subject
had
become
a
little
daft
no
one
in
his
experience
had
ever
passed
unscathed
through
that
malarious
marsh
in
his
fancy
office
was
poison
it
killed
body
and
soul
physically
and
socially
office
was
more
poisonous
than
priestcraft
or
pedagogy
in
proportion
as
it
held
more
power
but
the
poison
he
complained
of
was
not
ambition
he
shared
none
of
cardinal
wolsey
belated
penitence
for
that
healthy
stimulant
as
he
had
shared
none
of
the
fruits
his
poison
was
that
of
the
will
the
distortion
of
sight
the
warping
of
mind
the
degradation
of
tissue
the
coarsening
of
taste
the
narrowing
of
sympathy
to
the
emotions
of
a
caged
rat
hay
needed
no
office
in
order
to
wield
influence
for
him
influence
lay
about
the
streets
waiting
for
him
to
stoop
to
it
he
enjoyed
more
than
enough
power
without
office
no
one
of
his
position
wealth
and
political
experience
living
at
the
centre
of
politics
in
contact
with
the
active
party
managers
could
escape
influence
his
only
ambition
was
to
escape
annoyance
and
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
at
sixty
years
of
age
sensitive
to
physical
strain
still
more
sensitive
to
brutality
vindictiveness
or
betrayal
he
took
office
at
cost
of
life
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
surrenden
circle
made
pretence
of
gladness
at
the
new
dignity
for
with
all
his
gaiety
of
manner
and
lightness
of
wit
he
took
dark
views
of
himself
none
the
lighter
for
their
humor
and
his
obedience
to
the
president
order
was
the
gloomiest
acquiescence
he
had
ever
smiled
adams
took
dark
views
too
not
so
much
on
hay
account
as
on
his
own
for
while
hay
had
at
least
the
honors
of
office
his
friends
would
share
only
the
ennuis
of
it
but
as
usual
with
hay
nothing
was
gained
by
taking
such
matters
solemnly
and
old
habits
of
the
civil
war
left
their
mark
of
military
drill
on
every
one
who
lived
through
it
he
shouldered
his
pack
and
started
for
home
adams
had
no
mind
to
lose
his
friend
without
a
struggle
though
he
had
never
known
such
sort
of
struggle
to
avail
the
chance
was
desperate
but
he
could
not
afford
to
throw
it
away
so
as
soon
as
the
surrenden
establishment
broke
up
on
october
he
prepared
for
return
home
and
on
november
none
too
gladly
found
himself
again
gazing
into
la
fayette
square
he
had
made
another
false
start
and
lost
two
years
more
of
education
nor
had
he
excuse
for
this
time
neither
politics
nor
society
drew
him
away
from
his
trail
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics
at
home
or
abroad
and
never
affected
agreement
with
his
views
or
his
methods
nor
did
hay
care
whether
his
friends
agreed
or
disagreed
they
all
united
in
trying
to
help
each
other
to
get
along
the
best
way
they
could
and
all
they
tried
to
save
was
the
personal
relation
even
there
adams
would
have
been
beaten
had
he
not
been
helped
by
hay
who
saw
the
necessity
of
distraction
and
led
her
husband
into
the
habit
of
stopping
every
afternoon
to
take
his
friend
off
for
an
hour
walk
followed
by
a
cup
of
tea
with
hay
afterwards
and
a
chat
with
any
one
who
called
for
the
moment
therefore
the
situation
was
saved
at
least
in
outward
appearance
and
adams
could
go
back
to
his
own
pursuits
which
were
slowly
taking
a
direction
perhaps
they
had
no
right
to
be
called
pursuits
for
in
truth
one
consciously
pursued
nothing
but
drifted
as
attraction
offered
itself
the
short
session
broke
up
the
washington
circle
so
that
on
march
adams
was
able
to
sail
with
the
lodges
for
europe
and
to
pass
april
in
sicily
and
rome
with
the
lodges
education
always
began
afresh
forty
years
had
left
little
of
the
palermo
that
garibaldi
had
shown
to
the
boy
of
but
sicily
in
all
ages
seems
to
have
taught
only
catastrophe
and
violence
running
riot
on
that
theme
ever
since
ulysses
began
its
study
on
the
eye
of
cyclops
for
a
lesson
in
anarchy
without
a
shade
of
sequence
sicily
stands
alone
and
defies
evolution
syracuse
teaches
more
than
rome
yet
even
rome
was
not
mute
and
the
church
of
ara
coeli
seemed
more
and
more
to
draw
all
the
threads
of
thought
to
a
centre
for
every
new
journey
led
back
to
its
steps
karnak
ephesus
delphi
mycenæ
constantinople
syracuse
all
lying
on
the
road
to
the
capitol
what
they
had
to
bring
by
way
of
intellectual
riches
could
not
yet
be
discerned
but
they
carried
of
moral
and
new
york
sent
most
of
all
for
in
forty
years
america
had
made
so
vast
a
stride
to
empire
that
the
world
of
stood
already
on
a
distant
horizon
somewhere
on
the
same
plane
with
the
republic
of
brutus
and
cato
while
schoolboys
read
of
abraham
lincoln
as
they
did
of
julius
caesar
vast
swarms
of
americans
knew
the
civil
war
only
by
school
history
as
they
knew
the
story
of
cromwell
or
cicero
and
were
as
familiar
with
political
assassination
as
though
they
had
lived
under
nero
the
climax
of
empire
could
be
seen
approaching
year
after
year
as
though
sulla
were
a
president
or
mckinley
a
consul
nothing
annoyed
americans
more
than
to
be
told
this
simple
and
obvious
in
no
way
unpleasant
truth
therefore
one
sat
silent
as
ever
on
the
capitol
but
by
way
of
completing
the
lesson
the
lodges
added
a
pilgrimage
to
assisi
and
an
interview
with
francis
whose
solution
of
historical
riddles
seemed
the
most
satisfactory
or
sufficient
ever
offered
worth
fully
forty
years
more
study
and
better
worth
it
than
gibbon
himself
or
even
augustine
ambrose
or
jerome
the
most
bewildering
effect
of
all
these
fresh
on
the
old
assistant
professor
of
was
due
to
the
astonishing
contrast
between
what
he
had
taught
then
and
what
he
found
himself
confusedly
trying
to
learn
years
afterwards
between
the
twelfth
century
of
his
thirtieth
and
that
of
his
sixtieth
years
at
harvard
college
weary
of
spirit
in
the
wastes
of
law
he
had
occasionally
given
way
to
outbursts
of
derision
at
shedding
his
for
the
sublime
truths
of
sac
and
soc
hic
jacet
homunculus
scriptor
doctor
barbaricus
henricus
adams
adae
filius
et
evae
primo
explicuit
socnam
the
latin
was
as
as
the
law
and
he
meant
as
satire
the
claim
that
he
had
been
first
to
explain
the
legal
meaning
of
sac
and
soc
although
any
german
professor
would
have
scorned
it
as
a
shameless
and
presumptuous
bid
for
immortality
but
the
whole
point
of
view
had
vanished
in
not
he
but
sir
henry
maine
and
rudolph
sohm
were
the
parents
or
creators
of
sac
and
soc
convinced
that
the
clue
of
religion
led
to
nothing
and
that
politics
led
to
chaos
one
had
turned
to
the
law
as
one
scholars
turned
to
the
law
school
because
one
could
see
no
other
path
to
a
profession
the
law
had
proved
as
futile
as
politics
or
religion
or
any
other
single
thread
spun
by
the
human
spider
it
offered
no
more
continuity
than
architecture
or
coinage
and
no
more
force
of
its
own
francis
expressed
supreme
contempt
for
them
all
and
solved
the
whole
problem
by
rejecting
it
altogether
adams
returned
to
paris
with
a
broken
and
contrite
spirit
prepared
to
admit
that
his
life
had
no
meaning
and
conscious
that
in
any
case
it
no
longer
mattered
he
passed
a
summer
of
solitude
contrasting
sadly
with
the
last
at
surrenden
but
the
solitude
did
what
the
society
did
not
it
forced
and
drove
him
into
the
study
of
his
ignorance
in
silence
here
at
last
he
entered
the
practice
of
his
final
profession
hunted
by
ennui
he
could
no
longer
escape
and
by
way
of
a
summer
school
he
began
a
methodical
survey
a
triangulation
of
the
twelfth
century
the
pursuit
had
a
singular
french
charm
which
france
had
long
lost
a
calmness
lucidity
simplicity
of
expression
vigor
of
action
complexity
of
local
color
that
made
paris
flat
in
the
long
summer
days
one
found
a
sort
of
saturated
green
pleasure
in
the
forests
and
gray
infinity
of
rest
in
the
little
churches
that
lined
them
as
unassuming
as
their
own
mosses
and
as
sure
of
their
purpose
as
their
round
arches
but
churches
were
many
and
summer
was
short
so
that
he
was
at
last
driven
back
to
the
quays
and
photographs
for
weeks
he
lived
in
silence
his
solitude
was
broken
in
november
by
the
chance
arrival
of
john
la
farge
at
that
moment
contact
with
la
farge
had
a
new
value
of
all
the
men
who
had
deeply
affected
their
friends
since
john
la
farge
was
certainly
the
foremost
and
for
henry
adams
who
had
sat
at
his
feet
since
the
question
how
much
he
owed
to
la
farge
could
be
answered
only
by
admitting
that
he
had
no
standard
to
measure
it
by
of
all
his
friends
la
farge
alone
owned
a
mind
complex
enough
to
contrast
against
the
commonplaces
of
american
uniformity
and
in
the
process
had
vastly
perplexed
most
americans
who
came
in
contact
with
it
the
american
mind
the
bostonian
as
well
as
the
southern
or
western
likes
to
walk
straight
up
to
its
object
and
assert
or
deny
something
that
it
takes
for
a
fact
it
has
a
conventional
approach
a
conventional
analysis
and
a
conventional
conclusion
as
well
as
a
conventional
expression
all
the
time
loudly
asserting
its
unconventionality
the
most
disconcerting
trait
of
john
la
farge
was
his
reversal
of
the
process
his
approach
was
quiet
and
indirect
he
moved
round
an
object
and
never
separated
it
from
its
surroundings
he
prided
himself
on
faithfulness
to
tradition
and
convention
he
was
never
abrupt
and
abhorred
dispute
his
manners
and
attitude
towards
the
universe
were
the
same
whether
tossing
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
ocean
sketching
the
from
a
in
the
blast
of
or
drinking
the
in
the
formal
rites
of
japan
or
sipping
his
cocoanut
cup
of
kava
in
the
ceremonial
of
samoan
chiefs
or
reflecting
under
the
sacred
at
anaradjpura
one
was
never
quite
sure
of
his
whole
meaning
until
too
late
to
respond
for
he
had
no
difficulty
in
carrying
different
shades
of
contradiction
in
his
mind
as
he
said
of
his
friend
okakura
his
thought
ran
as
a
stream
runs
through
grass
hidden
perhaps
but
always
there
and
one
felt
often
uncertain
in
what
direction
it
flowed
for
even
a
contradiction
was
to
him
only
a
shade
of
difference
a
complementary
color
about
which
no
intelligent
artist
would
dispute
constantly
he
repulsed
argument
adams
you
reason
too
much
was
one
of
his
standing
reproaches
even
in
the
mild
discussion
of
rice
and
mangoes
in
the
warm
night
of
tahiti
dinners
he
should
have
blamed
adams
for
being
born
in
boston
the
mind
resorts
to
reason
for
want
of
training
and
adams
had
never
met
a
perfectly
trained
mind
to
la
farge
eccentricity
meant
convention
a
mind
really
eccentric
never
betrayed
it
true
eccentricity
was
a
tone
a
shade
a
nuance
and
the
finer
the
tone
the
truer
the
eccentricity
of
course
all
artists
hold
more
or
less
the
same
point
of
view
in
their
art
but
few
carry
it
into
daily
life
and
often
the
contrast
is
excessive
between
their
art
and
their
talk
one
evening
humphreys
johnston
who
was
devoted
to
la
farge
asked
him
to
meet
whistler
at
dinner
la
farge
was
ill
more
ill
than
usual
even
for
him
but
he
admired
and
liked
whistler
and
insisted
on
going
by
chance
adams
was
so
placed
as
to
overhear
the
conversation
of
both
and
had
no
choice
but
to
hear
that
of
whistler
which
engrossed
the
table
at
that
moment
the
boer
war
was
raging
and
as
every
one
knows
on
that
subject
whistler
raged
worse
than
the
boers
for
two
hours
he
declaimed
against
england
witty
declamatory
extravagant
bitter
amusing
and
noisy
but
in
substance
what
he
said
was
not
merely
commonplace
it
was
true
that
is
to
say
his
hearers
including
adams
and
as
far
as
he
knew
la
farge
agreed
with
it
all
and
mostly
as
a
matter
of
course
yet
la
farge
was
silent
and
this
difference
of
expression
was
a
difference
of
art
whistler
in
his
art
carried
the
sense
of
nuance
and
tone
far
beyond
any
point
reached
by
la
farge
or
even
attempted
but
in
talk
he
showed
above
or
below
his
a
willingness
to
seem
eccentric
where
no
real
eccentricity
unless
perhaps
of
temper
existed
this
vehemence
which
whistler
never
betrayed
in
his
painting
la
farge
seemed
to
lavish
on
his
glass
with
the
relative
value
of
la
farge
glass
in
the
history
of
adams
was
too
ignorant
to
meddle
and
as
a
rule
artists
were
if
possible
more
ignorant
than
he
but
whatever
it
was
it
led
him
back
to
the
twelfth
century
and
to
chartres
where
la
farge
not
only
felt
at
home
but
felt
a
sort
of
ownership
no
other
american
had
a
right
there
unless
he
too
were
a
member
of
the
church
and
worked
in
glass
adams
himself
was
an
interloper
but
long
habit
led
la
farge
to
resign
himself
to
adams
as
one
who
meant
well
though
deplorably
bostonian
while
adams
though
near
sixty
years
old
before
he
knew
anything
either
of
glass
or
of
chartres
asked
no
better
than
to
learn
and
only
la
farge
could
help
him
for
he
knew
enough
at
least
to
see
that
la
farge
alone
could
use
glass
like
a
artist
in
europe
the
art
had
been
dead
for
centuries
and
modern
glass
was
pitiable
even
la
farge
felt
the
early
glass
rather
as
a
document
than
as
a
historical
emotion
and
in
hundreds
of
windows
at
chartres
and
bourges
and
paris
adams
knew
barely
one
or
two
that
were
meant
to
hold
their
own
against
a
so
strong
as
his
in
conversation
la
farge
mind
was
opaline
with
infinite
shades
and
refractions
of
light
and
with
color
toned
down
to
the
finest
gradations
in
glass
it
was
insubordinate
it
was
renaissance
it
asserted
his
personal
force
with
depth
and
vehemence
of
tone
never
before
seen
he
seemed
bent
on
crushing
rivalry
even
the
gloom
of
a
paris
december
at
the
elysee
palace
hotel
was
somewhat
relieved
by
this
companionship
and
education
made
a
step
backwards
towards
chartres
but
la
farge
health
became
more
and
more
alarming
and
adams
was
glad
to
get
him
safely
back
to
new
york
january
while
he
himself
went
at
once
to
washington
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
hay
nothing
good
could
be
hoped
for
troubles
had
begun
and
were
quite
as
great
as
he
had
foreseen
adams
saw
as
little
encouragement
as
hay
himself
did
though
he
dared
not
say
so
he
doubted
hay
endurance
the
president
firmness
in
supporting
him
and
the
loyalty
of
his
party
friends
but
all
this
worry
on
account
fretted
him
not
nearly
so
much
as
the
boer
war
did
on
his
own
here
was
a
problem
in
his
political
education
that
passed
all
experience
since
the
treason
winter
of
much
to
his
astonishment
very
few
americans
seemed
to
share
his
point
of
view
their
hostility
to
england
seemed
mere
temper
but
to
adams
the
war
became
almost
a
personal
outrage
he
had
been
taught
from
childhood
even
in
england
that
his
forbears
and
their
associates
in
had
settled
once
for
all
the
liberties
of
the
british
free
colonies
and
he
very
strongly
objected
to
being
thrown
on
the
defensive
again
and
forced
to
sit
down
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
john
adams
had
begun
the
task
to
prove
by
appeal
to
law
and
fact
that
george
washington
was
not
a
felon
whatever
might
be
the
case
with
george
iii
for
reasons
still
more
personal
he
declined
peremptorily
to
entertain
question
of
the
felony
of
john
adams
he
felt
obliged
to
go
even
further
and
avow
the
opinion
that
if
at
any
time
england
should
take
towards
canada
the
position
she
took
towards
her
boer
colonies
the
united
states
would
be
bound
by
their
record
to
interpose
and
to
insist
on
the
application
of
the
principles
of
to
him
the
attitude
of
chamberlain
and
his
colleagues
seemed
exceedingly
and
terribly
embarrassing
to
hay
trained
early
in
the
stress
of
civil
war
to
hold
his
tongue
and
to
help
make
the
political
machine
run
somehow
since
it
could
never
be
made
to
run
well
he
would
not
bother
hay
with
theoretical
objections
which
were
every
day
fretting
him
in
practical
forms
chance
lay
in
patience
and
till
the
luck
should
turn
and
to
him
the
only
object
was
time
but
as
political
education
the
point
seemed
vital
to
adams
who
never
liked
shutting
his
eyes
or
denying
an
evident
fact
practical
politics
consists
in
ignoring
facts
but
education
and
politics
are
two
different
and
often
contradictory
things
in
this
case
the
contradiction
seemed
crude
with
hay
politics
at
home
or
abroad
adams
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
hay
belonged
to
the
new
york
school
like
abram
hewitt
evarts
whitney
samuel
tilden
men
who
played
the
game
for
ambition
or
amusement
and
played
it
as
a
rule
much
better
than
the
professionals
but
whose
aims
were
considerably
larger
than
those
of
the
usual
player
and
who
felt
no
great
love
for
the
cheap
drudgery
of
the
work
in
return
the
professionals
felt
no
great
love
for
them
and
set
them
aside
when
they
could
only
their
control
of
money
made
them
inevitable
and
even
this
did
not
always
carry
their
points
the
story
of
abram
hewitt
would
offer
one
type
of
this
statesman
series
and
that
of
hay
another
president
cleveland
set
aside
the
one
president
harrison
set
aside
the
other
there
is
no
politics
in
it
was
his
comment
on
hay
appointment
to
office
hay
held
a
different
opinion
and
turned
to
mckinley
whose
judgment
of
men
was
finer
than
common
in
presidents
mckinley
brought
to
the
problem
of
american
government
a
solution
which
lay
very
far
outside
of
henry
adams
education
but
which
seemed
to
be
at
least
practical
and
american
he
undertook
to
pool
interests
in
a
general
trust
into
which
every
interest
should
be
taken
more
or
less
at
its
own
valuation
and
whose
mass
should
under
his
management
create
efficiency
he
achieved
very
remarkable
results
how
much
they
cost
was
another
matter
if
the
public
is
ever
driven
to
its
last
resources
and
the
usual
remedies
of
chaos
the
result
will
probably
cost
more
himself
a
marvellous
manager
of
men
mckinley
found
several
manipulators
to
help
him
almost
as
remarkable
as
himself
one
of
whom
was
hay
but
unfortunately
hay
strength
was
weakest
and
his
task
hardest
at
home
interests
could
be
easily
combined
by
simply
paying
their
price
but
abroad
whatever
helped
on
one
side
hurt
him
on
another
hay
thought
england
must
be
brought
first
into
the
combine
but
at
that
time
germany
russia
and
france
were
all
combining
against
england
and
the
boer
war
helped
them
for
the
moment
hay
had
no
ally
abroad
or
at
home
except
pauncefote
and
adams
always
maintained
that
pauncefote
alone
pulled
him
through
yet
the
difficulty
abroad
was
far
less
troublesome
than
the
obstacles
at
home
the
senate
had
grown
more
and
more
unmanageable
even
since
the
time
of
andrew
johnson
and
this
was
less
the
fault
of
the
senate
than
of
the
system
a
treaty
of
peace
in
any
normal
state
of
things
said
hay
ought
to
be
ratified
with
unanimity
in
hours
they
wasted
six
weeks
in
wrangling
over
this
one
and
ratified
it
with
one
vote
to
spare
we
have
five
or
six
matters
now
demanding
settlement
i
can
settle
them
all
honorably
and
advantageously
to
our
own
side
and
i
am
assured
by
leading
men
in
the
senate
that
not
one
of
these
treaties
if
negotiated
will
pass
the
senate
i
should
have
a
majority
in
every
case
but
a
malcontent
third
would
certainly
dish
every
one
of
them
to
such
monstrous
shape
has
the
original
mistake
of
the
constitution
grown
in
the
evolution
of
our
politics
you
must
understand
it
is
not
merely
my
solution
the
senate
will
reject
they
will
reject
for
instance
any
treaty
whatever
on
any
subject
with
england
i
doubt
if
they
would
accept
any
treaty
of
consequence
with
russia
or
germany
the
recalcitrant
third
would
be
differently
composed
but
it
would
be
on
hand
so
that
the
real
duties
of
a
secretary
of
state
seem
to
be
three
to
fight
claims
upon
us
by
other
states
to
press
more
or
less
fraudulent
claims
of
our
own
citizens
upon
other
countries
to
find
offices
for
the
friends
of
senators
when
there
are
none
is
it
worth
while
for
me
to
keep
up
this
useless
labor
to
adams
who
like
hay
had
seen
a
dozen
acquaintances
struggling
with
the
same
enemies
the
question
had
scarcely
the
interest
of
a
new
study
he
had
said
all
he
had
to
say
about
it
in
a
dozen
or
more
volumes
relating
to
the
politics
of
a
hundred
years
before
to
him
the
spectacle
was
so
familiar
as
to
be
humorous
the
intrigue
was
too
open
to
be
interesting
the
interference
of
the
german
and
russian
legations
and
of
the
with
the
press
and
the
senate
was
innocently
undisguised
the
charming
russian
minister
count
cassini
the
ideal
of
diplomatic
manners
and
training
let
few
days
pass
without
appealing
through
the
press
to
the
public
against
the
government
the
german
minister
von
holleben
more
cautiously
did
the
same
thing
and
of
course
every
whisper
of
theirs
was
brought
instantly
to
the
department
these
three
forces
acting
with
the
regular
opposition
and
the
natural
obstructionists
could
always
stop
action
in
the
senate
the
fathers
had
intended
to
neutralize
the
energy
of
government
and
had
succeeded
but
their
machine
was
never
meant
to
do
the
work
of
a
society
in
the
twentieth
century
where
much
work
needed
to
be
quickly
and
efficiently
done
the
only
defence
of
the
system
was
that
as
government
did
nothing
well
it
had
best
do
nothing
but
the
government
in
truth
did
perfectly
well
all
it
was
given
to
do
and
even
if
the
charge
were
true
it
applied
equally
to
human
society
altogether
if
one
chose
to
treat
mankind
from
that
point
of
view
as
a
matter
of
mechanics
so
much
work
must
be
done
bad
machinery
merely
added
to
friction
always
unselfish
generous
easy
patient
and
loyal
hay
had
treated
the
world
as
something
to
be
taken
in
block
without
pulling
it
to
pieces
to
get
rid
of
its
defects
he
liked
it
all
he
laughed
and
accepted
he
had
never
known
unhappiness
and
would
have
gladly
lived
his
entire
life
over
again
exactly
as
it
happened
in
the
whole
new
york
school
one
met
a
similar
dash
of
humor
and
cynicism
more
or
less
pronounced
but
seldom
bitter
yet
even
the
gayest
of
tempers
succumbs
at
last
to
constant
friction
the
old
friend
was
rapidly
fading
the
habit
remained
but
the
easy
intimacy
the
careless
gaiety
the
casual
humor
the
equality
of
indifference
were
sinking
into
the
routine
of
office
the
mind
lingered
in
the
department
the
thought
failed
to
react
the
wit
and
humor
shrank
within
the
blank
walls
of
politics
and
the
irritations
multiplied
to
a
head
of
bureau
the
result
seemed
ennobling
although
as
education
this
branch
of
study
was
more
familiar
and
older
than
the
twelfth
century
the
task
of
bringing
the
two
periods
into
a
common
relation
was
new
ignorance
required
that
these
political
and
social
and
scientific
values
of
the
twelfth
and
twentieth
centuries
should
be
correlated
in
some
relation
of
movement
that
could
be
expressed
in
mathematics
nor
did
one
care
in
the
least
that
all
the
world
said
it
could
not
be
done
or
that
one
knew
not
enough
mathematics
even
to
figure
a
formula
beyond
the
schoolboy
s
if
kepler
and
newton
could
take
liberties
with
the
sun
and
moon
an
obscure
person
in
a
remote
wilderness
like
la
fayette
square
could
take
liberties
with
congress
and
venture
to
multiply
half
its
attraction
into
the
square
of
its
time
he
had
only
to
find
a
value
even
infinitesimal
for
its
attraction
at
any
given
time
a
historical
formula
that
should
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
stellar
universe
weighed
heavily
on
his
mind
but
a
trifling
matter
like
this
was
one
in
which
he
could
look
for
no
help
from
anybody
he
could
look
only
for
derision
at
best
all
his
associates
in
history
condemned
such
an
attempt
as
futile
and
almost
immoral
certainly
hostile
to
sound
historical
system
adams
tried
it
only
because
of
its
hostility
to
all
that
he
had
taught
for
history
since
he
started
afresh
from
the
new
point
that
whatever
was
right
all
he
had
ever
taught
was
wrong
he
had
pursued
ignorance
thus
far
with
success
and
had
swept
his
mind
clear
of
knowledge
in
beginning
again
from
the
of
sir
isaac
newton
he
looked
about
him
in
vain
for
a
teacher
few
men
in
washington
cared
to
overstep
the
school
conventions
and
the
most
distinguished
of
them
simon
newcomb
was
too
sound
a
mathematician
to
treat
such
a
scheme
seriously
the
greatest
of
americans
judged
by
his
rank
in
science
willard
gibbs
never
came
to
washington
and
adams
never
enjoyed
a
chance
to
meet
him
after
gibbs
one
of
the
most
distinguished
was
langley
of
the
smithsonian
who
was
more
accessible
to
whom
adams
had
been
much
in
the
habit
of
turning
whenever
he
wanted
an
outlet
for
his
vast
reservoirs
of
ignorance
langley
listened
with
outward
patience
to
his
disputatious
questionings
but
he
too
nourished
a
scientific
passion
for
doubt
and
sentimental
attachment
for
its
avowal
he
had
the
physicist
heinous
fault
of
professing
to
know
nothing
between
flashes
of
intense
perception
like
so
many
other
great
observers
langley
was
not
a
mathematician
and
like
most
physicists
he
believed
in
physics
rigidly
denying
himself
the
amusement
of
philosophy
which
consists
chiefly
in
suggesting
unintelligible
answers
to
insoluble
problems
he
still
knew
the
problems
and
liked
to
wander
past
them
in
a
courteous
temper
even
bowing
to
them
distantly
as
though
recognizing
their
existence
while
doubting
their
respectability
he
generously
let
others
doubt
what
he
felt
obliged
to
affirm
and
early
put
into
adams
hands
the
concepts
of
modern
science
a
volume
by
judge
stallo
which
had
been
treated
for
a
dozen
years
by
the
schools
with
a
conspiracy
of
silence
such
as
inevitably
meets
every
revolutionary
work
that
upsets
the
stock
and
machinery
of
instruction
adams
read
and
failed
to
understand
then
he
asked
questions
and
failed
to
get
answers
probably
this
was
education
perhaps
it
was
the
only
scientific
education
open
to
a
student
years
old
who
asked
to
be
as
ignorant
as
an
astronomer
for
him
the
details
of
science
meant
nothing
he
wanted
to
know
its
mass
solar
heat
was
not
enough
or
was
too
much
kinetic
atoms
led
only
to
motion
never
to
direction
or
progress
history
had
no
use
for
multiplicity
it
needed
unity
it
could
study
only
motion
direction
attraction
relation
everything
must
be
made
to
move
together
one
must
seek
new
worlds
to
measure
and
so
like
rasselas
adams
set
out
once
more
and
found
himself
on
may
settled
in
rooms
at
the
very
door
of
the
trocadero
chapter
xxv
the
dynamo
and
the
virgin
until
the
great
exposition
of
closed
its
doors
in
november
adams
haunted
it
aching
to
absorb
knowledge
and
helpless
to
find
it
he
would
have
liked
to
know
how
much
of
it
could
have
been
grasped
by
the
man
in
the
world
while
he
was
thus
meditating
chaos
langley
came
by
and
showed
it
to
him
at
behest
the
exhibition
dropped
its
superfluous
rags
and
stripped
itself
to
the
skin
for
langley
knew
what
to
study
and
why
and
how
while
adams
might
as
well
have
stood
outside
in
the
night
staring
at
the
milky
way
yet
langley
said
nothing
new
and
taught
nothing
that
one
might
not
have
learned
from
lord
bacon
three
hundred
years
before
but
though
one
should
have
known
the
advancement
of
science
as
well
as
one
knew
the
comedy
of
errors
the
literary
knowledge
counted
for
nothing
until
some
teacher
should
show
how
to
apply
it
bacon
took
a
vast
deal
of
trouble
in
teaching
king
james
i
and
his
subjects
american
or
other
towards
the
year
that
true
science
was
the
development
or
economy
of
forces
yet
an
elderly
american
in
knew
neither
the
formula
nor
the
forces
or
even
so
much
as
to
say
to
himself
that
his
historical
business
in
the
exposition
concerned
only
the
economies
or
developments
of
force
since
when
he
began
the
study
at
chicago
nothing
in
education
is
so
astonishing
as
the
amount
of
ignorance
it
accumulates
in
the
form
of
inert
facts
adams
had
looked
at
most
of
the
accumulations
of
art
in
the
storehouses
called
art
museums
yet
he
did
not
know
how
to
look
at
the
art
exhibits
of
he
had
studied
karl
marx
and
his
doctrines
of
history
with
profound
attention
yet
he
could
not
apply
them
at
paris
langley
with
the
ease
of
a
great
master
of
experiment
threw
out
of
the
field
every
exhibit
that
did
not
reveal
a
new
application
of
force
and
naturally
threw
out
to
begin
with
almost
the
whole
art
exhibit
equally
he
ignored
almost
the
whole
industrial
exhibit
he
led
his
pupil
directly
to
the
forces
his
chief
interest
was
in
new
motors
to
make
his
airship
feasible
and
he
taught
adams
the
astonishing
complexities
of
the
new
daimler
motor
and
of
the
automobile
which
since
had
become
a
nightmare
at
a
hundred
kilometres
an
hour
almost
as
destructive
as
the
electric
tram
which
was
only
ten
years
older
and
threatening
to
become
as
terrible
as
the
locomotive
itself
which
was
almost
exactly
adams
own
age
then
he
showed
his
scholar
the
great
hall
of
dynamos
and
explained
how
little
he
knew
about
electricity
or
force
of
any
kind
even
of
his
own
special
sun
which
spouted
heat
in
inconceivable
volume
but
which
as
far
as
he
knew
might
spout
less
or
more
at
any
time
for
all
the
certainty
he
felt
in
it
to
him
the
dynamo
itself
was
but
an
ingenious
channel
for
conveying
somewhere
the
heat
latent
in
a
few
tons
of
poor
coal
hidden
in
a
dirty
carefully
kept
out
of
sight
but
to
adams
the
dynamo
became
a
symbol
of
infinity
as
he
grew
accustomed
to
the
great
gallery
of
machines
he
began
to
feel
the
dynamos
as
a
moral
force
much
as
the
early
christians
felt
the
cross
the
planet
itself
seemed
less
impressive
in
its
deliberate
annual
or
daily
revolution
than
this
huge
wheel
revolving
within
arm
length
at
some
vertiginous
speed
and
barely
murmuring
scarcely
humming
an
audible
warning
to
stand
a
further
for
respect
of
power
while
it
would
not
wake
the
baby
lying
close
against
its
frame
before
the
end
one
began
to
pray
to
it
inherited
instinct
taught
the
natural
expression
of
man
before
silent
and
infinite
force
among
the
thousand
symbols
of
ultimate
energy
the
dynamo
was
not
so
human
as
some
but
it
was
the
most
expressive
yet
the
dynamo
next
to
the
was
the
most
familiar
of
exhibits
for
adams
objects
its
value
lay
chiefly
in
its
occult
mechanism
between
the
dynamo
in
the
gallery
of
machines
and
the
outside
the
break
of
continuity
amounted
to
abysmal
fracture
for
a
historian
objects
no
more
relation
could
he
discover
between
the
steam
and
the
electric
current
than
between
the
cross
and
the
cathedral
the
forces
were
interchangeable
if
not
reversible
but
he
could
see
only
an
absolute
fiat
in
electricity
as
in
faith
langley
could
not
help
him
indeed
langley
seemed
to
be
worried
by
the
same
trouble
for
he
constantly
repeated
that
the
new
forces
were
anarchical
and
especially
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
new
rays
that
were
little
short
of
parricidal
in
their
wicked
spirit
towards
science
his
own
rays
with
which
he
had
doubled
the
solar
spectrum
were
altogether
harmless
and
beneficent
but
radium
denied
its
god
or
what
was
to
langley
the
same
thing
denied
the
truths
of
his
science
the
force
was
wholly
new
a
historian
who
asked
only
to
learn
enough
to
be
as
futile
as
langley
or
kelvin
made
rapid
progress
under
this
teaching
and
mixed
himself
up
in
the
tangle
of
ideas
until
he
achieved
a
sort
of
paradise
of
ignorance
vastly
consoling
to
his
fatigued
senses
he
wrapped
himself
in
vibrations
and
rays
which
were
new
and
he
would
have
hugged
marconi
and
branly
had
he
met
them
as
he
hugged
the
dynamo
while
he
lost
his
arithmetic
in
trying
to
figure
out
the
equation
between
the
discoveries
and
the
economies
of
force
the
economies
like
the
discoveries
were
absolute
supersensual
occult
incapable
of
expression
in
what
mathematical
equivalent
could
he
suggest
as
the
value
of
a
branly
coherer
frozen
air
or
the
electric
furnace
had
some
scale
of
measurement
no
doubt
if
somebody
could
invent
a
thermometer
adequate
to
the
purpose
but
had
played
no
part
whatever
in
man
consciousness
and
the
atom
itself
had
figured
only
as
a
fiction
of
thought
in
these
seven
years
man
had
translated
himself
into
a
new
universe
which
had
no
common
scale
of
measurement
with
the
old
he
had
entered
a
supersensual
world
in
which
he
could
measure
nothing
except
by
chance
collisions
of
movements
imperceptible
to
his
senses
perhaps
even
imperceptible
to
his
instruments
but
perceptible
to
each
other
and
so
to
some
known
ray
at
the
end
of
the
scale
langley
seemed
prepared
for
anything
even
for
an
indeterminable
number
of
universes
interfused
physics
stark
mad
in
metaphysics
historians
undertake
to
arrange
sequences
called
stories
or
histories
assuming
in
silence
a
relation
of
cause
and
effect
these
assumptions
hidden
in
the
depths
of
dusty
libraries
have
been
astounding
but
commonly
unconscious
and
childlike
so
much
so
that
if
any
captious
critic
were
to
drag
them
to
light
historians
would
probably
reply
with
one
voice
that
they
had
never
supposed
themselves
required
to
know
what
they
were
talking
about
adams
for
one
had
toiled
in
vain
to
find
out
what
he
meant
he
had
even
published
a
dozen
volumes
of
american
history
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
satisfy
himself
whether
by
severest
process
of
stating
with
the
least
possible
comment
such
facts
as
seemed
sure
in
such
order
as
seemed
rigorously
consequent
he
could
fix
for
a
familiar
moment
a
necessary
sequence
of
human
movement
the
result
had
satisfied
him
as
little
as
at
harvard
college
where
he
saw
sequence
other
men
saw
something
quite
different
and
no
one
saw
the
same
unit
of
measure
he
cared
little
about
his
experiments
and
less
about
his
statesmen
who
seemed
to
him
quite
as
ignorant
as
himself
and
as
a
rule
no
more
honest
but
he
insisted
on
a
relation
of
sequence
and
if
he
could
not
reach
it
by
one
method
he
would
try
as
many
methods
as
science
knew
satisfied
that
the
sequence
of
men
led
to
nothing
and
that
the
sequence
of
their
society
could
lead
no
further
while
the
mere
sequence
of
time
was
artificial
and
the
sequence
of
thought
was
chaos
he
turned
at
last
to
the
sequence
of
force
and
thus
it
happened
that
after
ten
pursuit
he
found
himself
lying
in
the
gallery
of
machines
at
the
great
exposition
of
his
historical
neck
broken
by
the
sudden
irruption
of
forces
totally
new
since
no
one
else
showed
much
concern
an
elderly
person
without
other
cares
had
no
need
to
betray
alarm
the
year
was
not
the
first
to
upset
schoolmasters
copernicus
and
galileo
had
broken
many
professorial
necks
about
columbus
had
stood
the
world
on
its
head
towards
but
the
nearest
approach
to
the
revolution
of
was
that
of
when
constantine
set
up
the
cross
the
rays
that
langley
disowned
as
well
as
those
which
he
fathered
were
occult
supersensual
irrational
they
were
a
revelation
of
mysterious
energy
like
that
of
the
cross
they
were
what
in
terms
of
mediaeval
science
were
called
immediate
modes
of
the
divine
substance
the
historian
was
thus
reduced
to
his
last
resources
clearly
if
he
was
bound
to
reduce
all
these
forces
to
a
common
value
this
common
value
could
have
no
measure
but
that
of
their
attraction
on
his
own
mind
he
must
treat
them
as
they
had
been
felt
as
convertible
reversible
interchangeable
attractions
on
thought
he
made
up
his
mind
to
venture
it
he
would
risk
translating
rays
into
faith
such
a
reversible
process
would
vastly
amuse
a
chemist
but
the
chemist
could
not
deny
that
he
or
some
of
his
fellow
physicists
could
feel
the
force
of
both
when
adams
was
a
boy
in
boston
the
best
chemist
in
the
place
had
probably
never
heard
of
venus
except
by
way
of
scandal
or
of
the
virgin
except
as
idolatry
neither
had
he
heard
of
dynamos
or
automobiles
or
radium
yet
his
mind
was
ready
to
feel
the
force
of
all
though
the
rays
were
unborn
and
the
women
were
dead
here
opened
another
totally
new
education
which
promised
to
be
by
far
the
most
hazardous
of
all
the
along
which
he
must
crawl
like
sir
lancelot
in
the
twelfth
century
divided
two
kingdoms
of
force
which
had
nothing
in
common
but
attraction
they
were
as
different
as
a
magnet
is
from
gravitation
supposing
one
knew
what
a
magnet
was
or
gravitation
or
love
the
force
of
the
virgin
was
still
felt
at
lourdes
and
seemed
to
be
as
potent
as
but
in
america
neither
venus
nor
virgin
ever
had
value
as
force
at
most
as
sentiment
no
american
had
ever
been
truly
afraid
of
either
this
problem
in
dynamics
gravely
perplexed
an
american
historian
the
woman
had
once
been
supreme
in
france
she
still
seemed
potent
not
merely
as
a
sentiment
but
as
a
force
why
was
she
unknown
in
america
for
evidently
america
was
ashamed
of
her
and
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
otherwise
they
would
not
have
strewn
so
profusely
all
over
her
when
she
was
a
true
force
she
was
ignorant
of
but
the
american
female
had
not
a
feature
that
would
have
been
recognized
by
adam
the
trait
was
notorious
and
often
humorous
but
any
one
brought
up
among
puritans
knew
that
sex
was
sin
in
any
previous
age
sex
was
strength
neither
art
nor
beauty
was
needed
every
one
even
among
puritans
knew
that
neither
diana
of
the
ephesians
nor
any
of
the
oriental
goddesses
was
worshipped
for
her
beauty
she
was
goddess
because
of
her
force
she
was
the
animated
dynamo
she
was
reproduction
the
greatest
and
most
mysterious
of
all
energies
all
she
needed
was
to
be
fecund
singularly
enough
not
one
of
adams
many
schools
of
education
had
ever
drawn
his
attention
to
the
opening
lines
of
lucretius
though
they
were
perhaps
the
finest
in
all
latin
literature
where
the
poet
invoked
venus
exactly
as
dante
invoked
the
virgin
quae
quondam
rerum
naturam
sola
gubernas
the
venus
of
epicurean
philosophy
survived
in
the
virgin
of
the
schools
donna
sei
tanto
grande
e
tanto
vali
che
qual
vuol
grazia
e
a
te
non
ricorre
sua
disianza
vuol
volar
senz
ali
all
this
was
to
american
thought
as
though
it
had
never
existed
the
true
american
knew
something
of
the
facts
but
nothing
of
the
feelings
he
read
the
letter
but
he
never
felt
the
law
before
this
historical
chasm
a
mind
like
that
of
adams
felt
itself
helpless
he
turned
from
the
virgin
to
the
dynamo
as
though
he
were
a
branly
coherer
on
one
side
at
the
louvre
and
at
chartres
as
he
knew
by
the
record
of
work
actually
done
and
still
before
his
eyes
was
the
highest
energy
ever
known
to
man
the
creator
of
of
his
noblest
art
exercising
vastly
more
attraction
over
the
human
mind
than
all
the
and
dynamos
ever
dreamed
of
and
yet
this
energy
was
unknown
to
the
american
mind
an
american
virgin
would
never
dare
command
an
american
venus
would
never
dare
exist
the
question
which
to
any
plain
american
of
the
nineteenth
century
seemed
as
remote
as
it
did
to
adams
drew
him
almost
violently
to
study
once
it
was
posed
and
on
this
point
langleys
were
as
useless
as
though
they
were
herbert
spencers
or
dynamos
the
idea
survived
only
as
art
there
one
turned
as
naturally
as
though
the
artist
were
himself
a
woman
adams
began
to
ponder
asking
himself
whether
he
knew
of
any
american
artist
who
had
ever
insisted
on
the
power
of
sex
as
every
classic
had
always
done
but
he
could
think
only
of
walt
whitman
bret
harte
as
far
as
the
magazines
would
let
him
venture
and
one
or
two
painters
for
the
all
the
rest
had
used
sex
for
sentiment
never
for
force
to
them
eve
was
a
tender
flower
and
herodias
an
unfeminine
horror
american
art
like
the
american
language
and
american
education
was
as
far
as
possible
sexless
society
regarded
this
victory
over
sex
as
its
greatest
triumph
and
the
historian
readily
admitted
it
since
the
moral
issue
for
the
moment
did
not
concern
one
who
was
studying
the
relations
of
unmoral
force
he
cared
nothing
for
the
sex
of
the
dynamo
until
he
could
measure
its
energy
vaguely
seeking
a
clue
he
wandered
through
the
art
exhibit
and
in
his
stroll
stopped
almost
every
day
before
general
sherman
which
had
been
given
the
central
post
of
honor
gaudens
himself
was
in
paris
putting
on
the
work
his
usual
interminable
last
touches
and
listening
to
the
usual
contradictory
suggestions
of
brother
sculptors
of
all
the
american
artists
who
gave
to
american
art
whatever
life
it
breathed
in
the
seventies
gaudens
was
perhaps
the
most
sympathetic
but
certainly
the
most
inarticulate
general
grant
or
don
cameron
had
scarcely
less
instinct
of
rhetoric
than
he
all
the
others
the
hunts
richardson
john
la
farge
stanford
white
were
exuberant
only
gaudens
could
never
discuss
or
dilate
on
an
emotion
or
suggest
artistic
arguments
for
giving
to
his
work
the
forms
that
he
felt
he
never
laid
down
the
law
or
affected
the
despot
or
became
brutalized
like
whistler
by
the
brutalities
of
his
world
he
required
no
incense
he
was
no
egoist
his
simplicity
of
thought
was
excessive
he
could
not
imitate
or
give
any
form
but
his
own
to
the
creations
of
his
hand
no
one
felt
more
strongly
than
he
the
strength
of
other
men
but
the
idea
that
they
could
affect
him
never
stirred
an
image
in
his
mind
this
summer
his
health
was
poor
and
his
spirits
were
low
for
such
a
temper
adams
was
not
the
best
companion
since
his
own
gaiety
was
not
folle
but
he
risked
going
now
and
then
to
the
studio
on
mont
parnasse
to
draw
him
out
for
a
stroll
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
or
dinner
as
pleased
his
moods
and
in
return
gaudens
sometimes
let
adams
go
about
in
his
company
once
gaudens
took
him
down
to
amiens
with
a
party
of
frenchmen
to
see
the
cathedral
not
until
they
found
themselves
actually
studying
the
sculpture
of
the
western
portal
did
it
dawn
on
adams
mind
that
for
his
purposes
gaudens
on
that
spot
had
more
interest
to
him
than
the
cathedral
itself
great
men
before
great
monuments
express
great
truths
provided
they
are
not
taken
too
solemnly
adams
never
tired
of
quoting
the
supreme
phrase
of
his
idol
gibbon
before
the
gothic
cathedrals
i
darted
a
contemptuous
look
on
the
stately
monuments
of
superstition
even
in
the
footnotes
of
his
history
gibbon
had
never
inserted
a
bit
of
humor
more
human
than
this
and
one
would
have
paid
largely
for
a
photograph
of
the
fat
little
historian
on
the
background
of
notre
dame
of
amiens
trying
to
persuade
his
readers
perhaps
himself
that
he
was
darting
a
contemptuous
look
on
the
stately
monument
for
which
he
felt
in
fact
the
respect
which
every
man
of
his
vast
study
and
active
mind
always
feels
before
objects
worthy
of
it
but
besides
the
humor
one
felt
also
the
relation
gibbon
ignored
the
virgin
because
in
religious
monuments
were
out
of
fashion
in
his
remark
sounded
fresh
and
simple
as
the
green
fields
to
ears
that
had
heard
a
hundred
years
of
other
remarks
mostly
no
more
fresh
and
certainly
less
simple
without
malice
one
might
find
it
more
instructive
than
a
whole
lecture
of
ruskin
one
sees
what
one
brings
and
at
that
moment
gibbon
brought
the
french
revolution
ruskin
brought
reaction
against
the
revolution
gaudens
had
passed
beyond
all
he
liked
the
stately
monuments
much
more
than
he
liked
gibbon
or
ruskin
he
loved
their
dignity
their
unity
their
scale
their
lines
their
lights
and
shadows
their
decorative
sculpture
but
he
was
even
less
conscious
than
they
of
the
force
that
created
it
all
the
virgin
the
woman
by
whose
genius
the
stately
monuments
of
superstition
were
built
through
which
she
was
expressed
he
would
have
seen
more
meaning
in
isis
with
the
cow
horns
at
edfoo
who
expressed
the
same
thought
the
art
remained
but
the
energy
was
lost
even
upon
the
artist
yet
in
mind
and
person
gaudens
was
a
survival
of
the
he
bore
the
stamp
of
the
renaissance
and
should
have
carried
an
image
of
the
virgin
round
his
neck
or
stuck
in
his
hat
like
louis
xi
in
mere
time
he
was
a
lost
soul
that
had
strayed
by
chance
to
the
twentieth
century
and
forgotten
where
it
came
from
he
writhed
and
cursed
at
his
ignorance
much
as
adams
did
at
his
own
but
in
the
opposite
sense
gaudens
was
a
child
of
benvenuto
cellini
smothered
in
an
american
cradle
adams
was
a
quintessence
of
boston
devoured
by
curiosity
to
think
like
benvenuto
gaudens
art
was
starved
from
birth
and
adams
instinct
was
blighted
from
babyhood
each
had
but
half
of
a
nature
and
when
they
came
together
before
the
virgin
of
amiens
they
ought
both
to
have
felt
in
her
the
force
that
made
them
one
but
it
was
not
so
to
adams
she
became
more
than
ever
a
channel
of
force
to
gaudens
she
remained
as
before
a
channel
of
taste
for
a
symbol
of
power
gaudens
instinctively
preferred
the
horse
as
was
plain
in
his
horse
and
victory
of
the
sherman
monument
doubtless
sherman
also
felt
it
so
the
attitude
was
so
american
that
for
at
least
forty
years
adams
had
never
realized
that
any
other
could
be
in
sound
taste
how
many
years
had
he
taken
to
admit
a
notion
of
what
michael
angelo
and
rubens
were
driving
at
he
could
not
say
but
he
knew
that
only
since
had
he
begun
to
feel
the
virgin
or
venus
as
force
and
not
everywhere
even
so
at
chartres
perhaps
at
lourdes
possibly
at
cnidos
if
one
could
still
find
there
the
divinely
naked
aphrodite
of
praxiteles
but
otherwise
one
must
look
for
force
to
the
goddesses
of
indian
mythology
the
idea
died
out
long
ago
in
the
german
and
english
stock
gaudens
at
amiens
was
hardly
less
sensitive
to
the
force
of
the
female
energy
than
matthew
arnold
at
the
grande
chartreuse
neither
of
them
felt
goddesses
as
power
only
as
reflected
emotion
human
expression
beauty
purity
taste
scarcely
even
as
sympathy
they
felt
a
railway
train
as
power
yet
they
and
all
other
artists
constantly
complained
that
the
power
embodied
in
a
railway
train
could
never
be
embodied
in
art
all
the
steam
in
the
world
could
not
like
the
virgin
build
chartres
yet
in
mechanics
whatever
the
mechanicians
might
think
both
energies
acted
as
interchangeable
force
on
man
and
by
action
on
man
all
known
force
may
be
measured
indeed
few
men
of
science
measured
force
in
any
other
way
after
once
admitting
that
a
straight
line
was
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
no
serious
mathematician
cared
to
deny
anything
that
suited
his
convenience
and
rejected
no
symbol
unproved
or
unproveable
that
helped
him
to
accomplish
work
the
symbol
was
force
as
a
or
a
triangle
was
force
as
the
mechanist
might
prove
by
losing
it
and
nothing
could
be
gained
by
ignoring
their
value
symbol
or
energy
the
virgin
had
acted
as
the
greatest
force
the
western
world
ever
felt
and
had
drawn
activities
to
herself
more
strongly
than
any
other
power
natural
or
supernatural
had
ever
done
the
historian
business
was
to
follow
the
track
of
the
energy
to
find
where
it
came
from
and
where
it
went
to
its
complex
source
and
shifting
channels
its
values
equivalents
conversions
it
could
scarcely
be
more
complex
than
radium
it
could
hardly
be
deflected
diverted
polarized
absorbed
more
perplexingly
than
other
radiant
matter
adams
knew
nothing
about
any
of
them
but
as
a
mathematical
problem
of
influence
on
human
progress
though
all
were
occult
all
reacted
on
his
mind
and
he
rather
inclined
to
think
the
virgin
easiest
to
handle
the
pursuit
turned
out
to
be
long
and
tortuous
leading
at
last
to
the
vast
forests
of
scholastic
science
from
zeno
to
descartes
hand
in
hand
with
thomas
aquinas
montaigne
and
pascal
one
stumbled
as
stupidly
as
though
one
were
still
a
german
student
of
only
with
the
instinct
of
despair
could
one
force
one
self
into
this
old
thicket
of
ignorance
after
having
been
repulsed
a
score
of
entrances
more
promising
and
more
popular
thus
far
no
path
had
led
anywhere
unless
perhaps
to
an
exceedingly
modest
living
years
of
study
had
proved
to
be
quite
futile
for
the
pursuit
of
power
one
controlled
no
more
force
in
than
in
although
the
amount
of
force
controlled
by
society
had
enormously
increased
the
secret
of
education
still
hid
itself
somewhere
behind
ignorance
and
one
fumbled
over
it
as
feebly
as
ever
in
such
labyrinths
the
staff
is
a
force
almost
more
necessary
than
the
legs
the
pen
becomes
a
sort
of
dog
to
keep
him
from
falling
into
the
gutters
the
pen
works
for
itself
and
acts
like
a
hand
modelling
the
plastic
material
over
and
over
again
to
the
form
that
suits
it
best
the
form
is
never
arbitrary
but
is
a
sort
of
growth
like
crystallization
as
any
artist
knows
too
well
for
often
the
pencil
or
pen
runs
into
and
shapelessness
loses
its
relations
stops
or
is
bogged
then
it
has
to
return
on
its
trail
and
recover
if
it
can
its
line
of
force
the
result
of
a
year
work
depends
more
on
what
is
struck
out
than
on
what
is
left
in
on
the
sequence
of
the
main
lines
of
thought
than
on
their
play
or
variety
compelled
once
more
to
lean
heavily
on
this
support
adams
covered
more
thousands
of
pages
with
figures
as
formal
as
though
they
were
algebra
laboriously
striking
out
altering
burning
experimenting
until
the
year
had
expired
the
exposition
had
long
been
closed
and
winter
drawing
to
its
end
before
he
sailed
from
cherbourg
on
january
for
home
chapter
xxvi
twilight
while
the
world
that
thought
itself
frivolous
and
submitted
meekly
to
hearing
itself
decried
as
vain
fluttered
through
the
paris
exposition
jogging
the
futilities
of
gaudens
rodin
and
besnard
the
world
that
thought
itself
serious
and
showed
other
infallible
marks
of
coming
mental
paroxysm
was
engaged
in
weird
doings
at
peking
and
elsewhere
such
as
startled
even
itself
of
all
branches
of
education
the
science
of
gauging
people
and
events
by
their
relative
importance
defies
study
most
insolently
for
three
or
four
generations
society
has
united
in
withering
with
contempt
and
opprobrium
the
shameless
futility
of
mme
de
pompadour
and
mme
du
barry
yet
if
one
bid
at
an
auction
for
some
object
that
had
been
approved
by
the
taste
of
either
lady
one
quickly
found
that
it
were
better
to
buy
napoleons
or
frederics
or
maria
theresas
or
all
the
philosophy
and
science
of
their
time
than
to
bid
for
a
chair
that
either
of
these
two
ladies
had
adorned
the
same
thing
might
be
said
in
a
different
sense
of
voltaire
while
as
every
one
knows
the
of
any
of
watteau
or
hogarth
nattier
or
sir
joshua
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
importance
of
the
men
society
seemed
to
delight
in
talking
with
solemn
conviction
about
serious
values
and
in
paying
fantastic
prices
for
nothing
but
the
most
futile
the
drama
acted
at
peking
in
the
summer
of
was
in
the
eyes
of
a
student
the
most
serious
that
could
be
offered
for
his
study
since
it
brought
him
suddenly
to
the
inevitable
struggle
for
the
control
of
china
which
in
his
view
must
decide
the
control
of
the
world
yet
as
a
the
fall
of
china
was
chiefly
studied
in
paris
and
london
as
a
calamity
to
chinese
porcelain
the
value
of
a
ming
vase
was
more
serious
than
universal
war
the
drama
of
the
legations
interested
the
public
much
as
though
it
were
a
novel
of
alexandre
dumas
but
the
bearing
of
the
drama
on
future
history
offered
an
interest
vastly
greater
adams
knew
no
more
about
it
than
though
he
were
the
statesman
in
europe
like
them
all
he
took
for
granted
that
the
legations
were
massacred
and
that
john
hay
who
alone
championed
china
administrative
entity
would
be
massacred
too
since
he
must
henceforth
look
on
in
impotence
while
russia
and
germany
dismembered
china
and
shut
up
america
at
home
nine
statesmen
out
of
ten
in
europe
accepted
this
result
in
advance
seeing
no
way
to
prevent
it
adams
saw
none
and
laughed
at
hay
for
his
helplessness
when
hay
suddenly
ignored
european
leadership
took
the
lead
himself
rescued
the
legations
and
saved
china
adams
looked
on
as
incredulous
as
europe
though
not
quite
so
stupid
since
on
that
branch
of
education
he
knew
enough
for
his
purpose
nothing
so
meteoric
had
ever
been
done
in
american
diplomacy
on
returning
to
washington
january
he
found
most
of
the
world
as
astonished
as
himself
but
less
stupid
than
usual
for
a
moment
indeed
the
world
had
been
struck
dumb
at
seeing
hay
put
europe
aside
and
set
the
washington
government
at
the
head
of
civilization
so
quietly
that
civilization
submitted
by
mere
instinct
of
docility
to
receive
and
obey
his
orders
but
after
the
first
shock
of
silence
society
felt
the
force
of
the
stroke
through
its
fineness
and
burst
into
almost
tumultuous
applause
instantly
the
diplomacy
of
the
nineteenth
century
with
all
its
painful
scuffles
and
struggles
was
forgotten
and
the
american
blushed
to
be
told
of
his
submissions
in
the
past
history
broke
in
halves
hay
was
too
good
an
artist
not
to
feel
the
artistic
skill
of
his
own
work
and
the
success
reacted
on
his
health
giving
him
fresh
life
for
with
him
as
with
most
men
success
was
a
tonic
and
depression
a
specific
poison
but
as
usual
his
troubles
nested
at
home
success
doubles
strain
president
mckinley
diplomatic
court
had
become
the
largest
in
the
world
and
the
diplomatic
relations
required
far
more
work
than
ever
before
while
the
staff
of
the
department
was
little
more
efficient
and
the
friction
in
the
senate
had
become
coagulated
hay
took
to
studying
the
diary
of
john
quincy
adams
eighty
years
before
and
calculated
that
the
resistance
had
increased
about
ten
times
as
measured
by
waste
of
days
and
increase
of
effort
although
secretary
of
state
adams
thought
himself
very
hardly
treated
hay
cheerfully
noted
that
it
was
killing
him
and
proved
it
for
the
effort
of
the
afternoon
walk
became
sometimes
painful
for
the
moment
things
were
going
fairly
well
and
hay
unruly
team
were
less
fidgety
but
pauncefote
still
pulled
the
whole
load
and
turned
the
dangerous
corners
safely
while
cassini
and
holleben
helped
the
senate
to
make
what
trouble
they
could
without
serious
offence
and
the
irish
after
the
genial
celtic
nature
obstructed
even
themselves
the
fortunate
irish
thanks
to
their
sympathetic
qualities
never
made
lasting
enmities
but
the
germans
seemed
in
a
fair
way
to
rouse
and
even
ugly
temper
in
the
spirit
of
politics
which
was
by
no
means
a
part
of
hay
plans
he
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
overcome
domestic
friction
and
felt
no
wish
to
alienate
foreign
powers
yet
so
much
could
be
said
in
favor
of
the
foreigners
that
they
commonly
knew
why
they
made
trouble
and
were
steady
to
a
motive
cassini
had
for
years
pursued
in
peking
as
in
washington
a
policy
of
his
own
never
disguised
and
as
little
in
harmony
with
his
chief
as
with
hay
he
made
his
opposition
on
fixed
lines
for
notorious
objects
but
senators
could
seldom
give
a
reason
for
obstruction
in
every
hundred
men
a
certain
number
obstruct
by
instinct
and
try
to
invent
reasons
to
explain
it
afterwards
the
senate
was
no
worse
than
the
board
of
a
university
but
incorporators
as
a
rule
have
not
made
this
class
of
men
dictators
on
purpose
to
prevent
action
in
the
senate
a
single
vote
commonly
stopped
legislation
or
in
committee
stifled
discussion
hay
policy
of
removing
one
after
another
all
irritations
and
closing
all
discussions
with
foreign
countries
roused
incessant
obstruction
which
could
be
overcome
only
by
patience
and
bargaining
in
executive
patronage
if
indeed
it
could
be
overcome
at
all
the
price
actually
paid
was
not
very
great
except
in
the
physical
exhaustion
of
hay
and
pauncefote
root
and
mckinley
no
serious
bargaining
of
equivalents
could
be
attempted
senators
would
not
sacrifice
five
dollars
in
their
own
states
to
gain
five
hundred
thousand
in
another
but
whenever
a
foreign
country
was
willing
to
surrender
an
advantage
without
an
equivalent
hay
had
a
chance
to
offer
the
senate
a
treaty
in
all
such
cases
the
price
paid
for
the
treaty
was
paid
wholly
to
the
senate
and
amounted
to
nothing
very
serious
except
in
waste
of
time
and
wear
of
strength
life
is
so
gay
and
horrid
laughed
hay
the
major
will
have
promised
all
the
consulates

the
senators
will
all
come
to
me
and
refuse
to
believe
me
i
shall
see
all
my
treaties
slaughtered
one
by
one
by
the
per
cent
of
kickers
and
strikers
the
only
mitigation
i
can
foresee
is
being
sick
a
good
part
of
the
time
i
am
nearing
my
grand
climacteric
and
the
great
culbute
is
approaching
he
was
thinking
of
his
friend
blaine
and
might
have
thought
of
all
his
predecessors
for
all
had
suffered
alike
and
to
adams
as
historian
their
sufferings
had
been
a
long
delight
the
solitary
picturesque
and
tragic
element
in
politics
incidentally
requiring
like
aaron
burr
and
william
giles
calhoun
and
webster
and
sumner
with
sir
forcible
feebles
like
james

and

exaggerations
like

the
senate
took
the
place
of

and
offered
real
brutuses
and
bolingbrokes
jack
cades
falstaffs
and
malvolios
endless
varieties
of
human
nature
nowhere
else
to
be
studied
and
none
the
less
amusing
because
they
killed
or
because
they
were
like
schoolboys
in
their
simplicity
life
is
so
gay
and
horrid
hay
still
felt
the
humor
though
more
and
more
rarely
but
what
he
felt
most
was
the
enormous
complexity
and
friction
of
the
vast
mass
he
was
trying
to
guide
he
bitterly
complained
that
it
had
made
him
a
bore
of
all
things
the
most
senatorial
and
to
him
the
most
obnoxious
the
old
friend
was
lost
and
only
the
teacher
remained
driven
to
madness
by
the
complexities
and
multiplicities
of
his
new
world
to
one
who
at
past
sixty
years
old
is
still
passionately
seeking
education
these
small
or
large
annoyances
had
no
great
value
except
as
measures
of
mass
and
motion
for
him
the
practical
interest
and
the
practical
man
were
such
as
looked
forward
to
the
next
election
or
perhaps
in
corporations
five
or
ten
years
scarcely
men
in
america
could
be
named
who
were
known
to
have
looked
a
dozen
years
ahead
while
any
historian
who
means
to
keep
his
alignment
with
past
and
future
must
cover
a
horizon
of
two
generations
at
least
if
he
seeks
to
align
himself
with
the
future
he
must
assume
a
condition
of
some
sort
for
a
world
fifty
years
beyond
his
own
every
historian
sometimes
unconsciously
but
always
inevitably
must
have
put
to
himself
the
question
how
long
could
an
outworn
system
last
he
can
never
give
himself
less
than
one
generation
to
show
the
full
effects
of
a
changed
condition
his
object
is
to
triangulate
from
the
widest
possible
base
to
the
furthest
point
he
thinks
he
can
see
which
is
always
far
beyond
the
curvature
of
the
horizon
to
the
practical
man
such
an
attempt
is
idiotic
and
probably
the
practical
man
is
in
the
right
but
whichever
is
right
if
the
question
of
right
or
wrong
enters
at
all
into
the
matter
the
historian
has
no
choice
but
to
go
on
alone
even
in
his
own
profession
few
companions
offer
help
and
his
walk
soon
becomes
solitary
leading
further
and
further
into
a
wilderness
where
twilight
is
short
and
the
shadows
are
dense
already
hay
literally
staggered
in
his
tracks
for
weariness
more
worn
than
he
clarence
king
dropped
one
day
in
the
spring
he
stopped
an
hour
in
washington
to
bid
cheerily
and
simply
telling
how
his
doctors
had
condemned
him
to
arizona
for
his
lungs
all
three
friends
knew
that
they
were
nearing
the
end
and
that
if
it
were
not
the
one
it
would
be
the
other
but
the
affectation
of
readiness
for
death
is
a
stage
role
and
stoicism
is
a
stupid
resource
though
the
only
one
non
doles
paete
one
is
ashamed
of
it
even
in
the
acting
the
sunshine
of
life
had
not
been
so
dazzling
of
late
but
that
a
share
of
it
flickered
out
for
adams
and
hay
when
king
disappeared
from
their
lives
but
hay
had
still
his
family
and
ambition
while
adams
could
only
blunder
back
alone
helplessly
wearily
his
eyes
rather
dim
with
tears
to
his
vague
trail
across
the
darkening
prairie
of
education
without
a
motive
big
or
small
except
curiosity
to
reach
before
he
too
should
drop
some
point
that
would
give
him
a
far
look
ahead
he
was
morbidly
curious
to
see
some
light
at
the
end
of
the
passage
as
though
thirty
years
were
a
shadow
and
he
were
again
to
fall
into
king
arms
at
the
door
of
the
last
and
only
log
cabin
left
in
life
time
had
become
terribly
short
and
the
sense
of
knowing
so
little
when
others
knew
so
much
crushed
out
hope
he
knew
not
in
what
new
direction
to
turn
and
sat
at
his
desk
idly
pulling
threads
out
of
the
tangled
skein
of
science
to
see
whether
or
why
they
aligned
themselves
the
commonest
and
oldest
toy
he
knew
was
the
child
magnet
with
which
he
had
played
since
babyhood
the
most
familiar
of
puzzles
he
covered
his
desk
with
magnets
and
mapped
out
their
lines
of
force
by
compass
then
he
read
all
the
books
he
could
find
and
tried
in
vain
to
makes
his
lines
of
force
agree
with
theirs
the
books
confounded
him
he
could
not
credit
his
own
understanding
here
was
literally
the
most
concrete
fact
in
nature
next
to
gravitation
which
it
defied
a
force
which
must
have
radiated
lines
of
energy
without
stop
since
time
began
if
not
longer
and
which
might
probably
go
on
radiating
after
the
sun
should
fall
into
the
earth
since
no
one
knew
why
or
how
or
what
it
radiated
or
even
whether
it
radiated
at
all
perhaps
the
earliest
known
of
all
natural
forces
after
the
solar
energies
it
seemed
to
have
suggested
no
idea
to
any
one
until
some
mariner
bethought
himself
that
it
might
serve
for
a
pointer
another
thousand
years
passed
when
it
taught
some
other
intelligent
man
to
use
it
as
a
pump
sieve
or
reservoir
for
collecting
electricity
still
without
knowing
how
it
worked
or
what
it
was
for
a
historian
the
story
of
faraday
experiments
and
the
invention
of
the
dynamo
passed
belief
it
revealed
a
condition
of
human
ignorance
and
helplessness
before
the
commonest
forces
such
as
his
mind
refused
to
credit
he
could
not
conceive
but
that
some
one
somewhere
could
tell
him
all
about
the
magnet
if
one
could
but
find
the
book
although
he
had
been
forced
to
admit
the
same
helplessness
in
the
face
of
gravitation
phosphorescence
and
odors
and
he
could
imagine
no
reason
why
society
should
treat
radium
as
revolutionary
in
science
when
every
infant
for
ages
past
had
seen
the
magnet
doing
what
radium
did
for
surely
the
kind
of
radiation
mattered
nothing
compared
with
the
energy
that
radiated
and
the
matter
supplied
for
radiation
he
dared
not
venture
into
the
complexities
of
chemistry
or
microbes
so
long
as
this
child
toy
offered
complexities
that
befogged
his
mind
beyond
and
turned
the
atom
into
an
endless
variety
of
pumps
endlessly
pumping
an
endless
variety
of
ethers
he
wanted
to
ask
mme
curie
to
invent
a
motor
attachable
to
her
salt
of
radium
and
pump
its
forces
through
it
as
faraday
did
with
a
magnet
he
figured
the
human
mind
itself
as
another
radiating
matter
through
which
man
had
always
pumped
a
subtler
fluid
in
all
this
futility
it
was
not
the
magnet
or
the
rays
or
the
microbes
that
troubled
him
or
even
his
helplessness
before
the
forces
to
that
he
was
used
from
childhood
the
magnet
in
its
new
relation
staggered
his
new
education
by
its
evidence
of
growing
complexity
and
multiplicity
and
even
contradiction
in
life
he
could
not
escape
it
politics
or
science
the
lesson
was
the
same
and
at
every
step
it
blocked
his
path
whichever
way
he
turned
he
found
it
in
politics
he
ran
against
it
in
science
he
struck
it
in
everyday
life
as
though
he
were
still
adam
in
the
garden
of
eden
between
god
who
was
unity
and
satan
who
was
complexity
with
no
means
of
deciding
which
was
truth
the
problem
was
the
same
for
mckinley
as
for
adam
and
for
the
senate
as
for
satan
hay
was
going
to
wreck
on
it
like
king
and
adams
all
one
life
one
had
struggled
for
unity
and
unity
had
always
won
the
national
government
and
the
national
unity
had
overcome
every
resistance
and
the
darwinian
evolutionists
were
triumphant
over
all
the
curates
yet
the
greater
the
unity
and
the
momentum
the
worse
became
the
complexity
and
the
friction
one
had
in
vain
bowed
neck
to
railways
banks
corporations
trusts
and
even
to
the
popular
will
as
far
as
one
could
understand
it
or
even
further
the
multiplicity
of
unity
had
steadily
increased
was
increasing
and
threatened
to
increase
beyond
reason
he
had
surrendered
all
his
favorite
prejudices
and
foresworn
even
the
forms
of
criticism
except
for
his
pet
amusement
the
senate
which
was
a
tonic
or
stimulant
necessary
to
healthy
life
he
had
accepted
uniformity
and
pteraspis
and
ice
age
and
tramways
and
telephones
and
now
just
when
he
was
ready
to
hang
the
crowning
garland
on
the
brow
of
a
completed
education
science
itself
warned
him
to
begin
it
again
from
the
beginning
maundering
among
the
magnets
he
bethought
himself
that
once
a
full
generation
earlier
he
had
begun
active
life
by
writing
a
confession
of
geological
faith
at
the
bidding
of
sir
charles
lyell
and
that
it
might
be
worth
looking
at
if
only
to
steady
his
vision
he
read
it
again
and
thought
it
better
than
he
could
do
at
but
elderly
minds
always
work
loose
he
saw
his
doubts
grown
larger
and
became
curious
to
know
what
had
been
said
about
them
since
the
geological
survey
supplied
stacks
of
volumes
and
reading
for
steady
months
while
the
longer
he
read
the
more
he
wondered
pondered
doubted
what
his
delightful
old
friend
sir
charles
lyell
would
have
said
about
it
truly
the
animal
that
is
to
be
trained
to
unity
must
be
caught
young
unity
is
vision
it
must
have
been
part
of
the
process
of
learning
to
see
the
older
the
mind
the
older
its
complexities
and
the
further
it
looks
the
more
it
sees
until
even
the
stars
resolve
themselves
into
multiples
yet
the
child
will
always
see
but
one
adams
asked
whether
geology
since
had
drifted
towards
unity
or
multiplicity
and
he
felt
that
the
drift
would
depend
on
the
age
of
the
man
who
drifted
seeking
some
impersonal
point
for
measure
he
turned
to
see
what
had
happened
to
his
oldest
friend
and
cousin
the
ganoid
fish
the
pteraspis
of
ludlow
and
wenlock
with
whom
he
had
sported
when
geological
life
was
young
as
though
they
had
all
remained
together
in
time
to
act
the
mask
of
comus
at
ludlow
castle
and
repeat
how
charming
is
divine
philosophy
he
felt
almost
aggrieved
to
find
walcott
so
vigorously
acting
the
part
of
comus
as
to
have
flung
the
ganoid
all
the
way
off
to
colorado
and
far
back
into
the
lower
trenton
limestone
making
the
pteraspis
as
modern
as
a
mississippi
by
spawning
an
ancestry
for
him
indefinitely
more
remote
in
the
dawn
of
known
organic
life
a
few
thousand
feet
more
or
less
of
limestone
were
the
liveliest
amusement
to
the
ganoid
but
they
buried
the
uniformitarian
alive
under
the
weight
of
his
own
uniformity
not
for
all
the
ganoid
fish
that
ever
swam
would
a
discreet
historian
dare
to
hazard
even
in
secret
an
opinion
about
the
value
of
natural
selection
by
minute
changes
under
uniform
conditions
for
he
could
know
no
more
about
it
than
most
of
his
neighbors
who
knew
nothing
but
natural
selection
that
did
not
select
evolution
finished
before
it
began
minute
changes
that
refused
to
change
anything
during
the
whole
geological
record
survival
of
the
highest
order
in
a
fauna
which
had
no
origin
uniformity
under
conditions
which
had
disturbed
everything
else
in
creation
to
an
though
ignorant
student
who
needed
to
prove
natural
selection
and
not
assume
it
such
sequence
brought
no
peace
he
wished
to
be
shown
that
changes
in
form
caused
evolution
in
force
that
chemical
or
mechanical
energy
had
by
natural
selection
and
minute
changes
under
uniform
conditions
converted
itself
into
thought
the
ganoid
fish
seemed
to
prove
to
him
that
it
had
selected
neither
new
form
nor
new
force
but
that
the
curates
were
right
in
thinking
that
force
could
be
increased
in
volume
or
raised
in
intensity
only
by
help
of
outside
force
to
him
the
ganoid
was
a
huge
perplexity
none
the
less
because
neither
he
nor
the
ganoid
troubled
darwinians
but
the
more
because
it
helped
to
reveal
that
darwinism
seemed
to
survive
only
in
england
in
vain
he
asked
what
sort
of
evolution
had
taken
its
place
almost
any
doctrine
seemed
orthodox
even
sudden
conversions
due
to
mere
vital
force
acting
on
its
own
lines
quite
beyond
mechanical
explanation
had
cropped
up
again
a
little
more
and
he
would
be
driven
back
on
the
old
independence
of
species
what
the
ontologist
thought
about
it
was
his
own
affair
like
the
theologist
views
on
theology
for
complexity
was
nothing
to
them
but
to
the
historian
who
sought
only
the
direction
of
thought
and
had
begun
as
the
confident
child
of
darwin
and
lyell
in
the
matter
of
direction
seemed
vital
then
he
had
entered
gaily
the
door
of
the
glacial
epoch
and
had
surveyed
a
universe
of
unities
and
uniformities
in
he
entered
a
far
vaster
universe
where
all
the
old
roads
ran
about
in
every
direction
overrunning
dividing
subdividing
stopping
abruptly
vanishing
slowly
with
that
led
nowhere
and
sequences
that
could
not
be
proved
the
active
geologists
had
mostly
become
specialists
dealing
with
complexities
far
too
technical
for
an
amateur
but
the
old
formulas
still
seemed
to
serve
for
beginners
as
they
had
served
when
new
so
the
cause
of
the
glacial
epoch
remained
at
the
mercy
of
lyell
and
croll
although
geikie
had
split
up
the
period
into
intermittent
chills
in
recent
geology
and
in
the
northern
hemisphere
alone
while
no
geologist
had
ventured
to
assert
that
the
glaciation
of
the
southern
hemisphere
could
possibly
be
referred
to
a
horizon
more
remote
continents
still
rose
wildly
and
wildly
sank
though
professor
suess
of
vienna
had
written
an
work
showing
that
continents
were
anchored
like
crystals
and
only
oceans
rose
and
sank
lyell
genial
uniformity
seemed
genial
still
for
nothing
had
taken
its
place
though
in
the
interval
granite
had
grown
young
nothing
had
been
explained
and
a
bewildering
system
of
huge
overthrusts
had
upset
geological
mechanics
the
textbooks
refused
even
to
discuss
theories
frankly
throwing
up
their
hands
and
avowing
that
progress
depended
on
studying
each
rock
as
a
law
to
itself
adams
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
correctness
of
the
science
than
the
or
the
port
jackson
shark
for
its
correctness
in
no
way
concerned
him
and
only
impertinence
could
lead
him
to
dispute
or
discuss
the
principles
of
any
science
but
the
history
of
the
mind
concerned
the
historian
alone
and
the
historian
had
no
vital
concern
in
anything
else
for
he
found
no
change
to
record
in
the
body
in
thought
the
schools
like
the
church
raised
ignorance
to
a
faith
and
degraded
dogma
to
heresy
evolution
survived
like
the
trilobites
without
evolving
and
yet
the
evolutionists
held
the
whole
field
and
had
even
plucked
up
courage
to
rebel
against
the
cossack
ukase
of
lord
kelvin
forbidding
them
to
ask
more
than
twenty
million
years
for
their
experiments
no
doubt
the
geologists
had
always
submitted
sadly
to
this
last
and
utmost
violence
inflicted
on
them
by
the
pontiff
of
physical
religion
in
the
effort
to
force
unification
of
the
universe
they
had
protested
with
mild
conviction
that
they
could
not
state
the
geological
record
in
terms
of
time
they
had
murmured
ignoramus
under
their
breath
but
they
had
never
dared
to
assert
the
ignorabimus
that
lay
on
the
tips
of
their
tongues
yet
the
admission
seemed
close
at
hand
evolution
was
becoming
change
of
form
broken
by
freaks
of
force
and
warped
at
times
by
attractions

the

more
than

of
the

of

quarter
in

where
one
must
feel
no
fatigue
at
two
in

in

even
after
four
hours
of
mounet
sully
at
the
theatre
francais
in
those
branches
education
might
be
called
closed
fashion
too
could
no
longer
teach
anything
worth
knowing
to
a
man
who
holding
open
the
door
into
the
next
world
regarded
himself
as
merely
looking
round
to
take
a
last
glance
of
this
the
glance
was
more
amusing
than
any
he
had
known
in
his
active
life
but
it
was
more
infinitely
more
chaotic
and
complex
still
something
remained
to
be
done
for
education
beyond
the
chaos
and
as
usual
the
woman
helped
for
thirty
years
or
he
had
been
repeating
that
he
really
must
go
to
baireuth
suddenly
lodge
appeared
on
the
horizon
and
bade
him
come
he
joined
them
parents
and
children
alert
and
eager
and
appreciative
as
ever
at
the
little
old
town
of
taube
and
they
went
on
to
the
baireuth
festival
together
thirty
years
earlier
a
baireuth
festival
would
have
made
an
immense
stride
in
education
and
the
spirit
of
the
master
would
have
opened
a
vast
new
world
in
the
effect
was
altogether
different
from
the
spirit
of
the
master
in
the
rococo
setting
of
baireuth
seemed
the
correct
atmosphere
for
siegfried
and
brunhilde
perhaps
even
for
parsifal
baireuth
was
out
of
the
world
calm
contemplative
and
remote
in
the
world
had
altogether
changed
and
wagner
had
become
a
part
of
it
as
familiar
as
shakespeare
or
bret
harte
the
rococo
element
jarred
even
the
hudson
and
the
susquehanna
perhaps
the
potomac
itself
had
often
risen
to
drown
out
the
gods
of
walhalla
and
one
could
hardly
listen
to
the
gotterdammerung
in
new
york
among
throngs
of
intense
young
enthusiasts
without
paroxysms
of
nervous
excitement
that
toned
down
to
musical
philistinism
at
baireuth
as
though
the
gods
were
bavarian
composers
new
york
or
paris
might
be
whatever
one
pleased
venal
sordid
vulgar
but
society
nursed
there
in
the
rottenness
of
its
decay
certain
anarchistic
ferments
and
thought
them
proof
of
art
perhaps
they
were
and
at
all
events
wagner
was
chiefly
responsible
for
them
as
artistic
emotion
new
york
knew
better
than
baireuth
what
wagner
meant
and
the
frivolities
of
paris
had
more
than
once
included
the
rising
of
the
seine
to
drown
out
the
etoile
or
montmartre
as
well
as
the
sorcery
of
ambition
that
casts
spells
of
enchantment
on
the
hero
paris
still
felt
a
subtile
flattery
in
the
thought
that
the
last
great
tragedy
of
gods
and
men
would
surely
happen
there
while
no
one
could
conceive
of
its
happening
at
baireuth
or
would
care
if
it
did
paris
coquetted
with
catastrophe
as
though
it
were
an
old
mistress
faced
it
almost
gaily
as
she
had
done
so
often
for
they
were
acquainted
since
rome
began
to
ravage
europe
while
new
york
met
it
with
a
glow
of
fascinated
horror
like
an
inevitable
earthquake
and
heard
ternina
announce
it
with
conviction
that
made
nerves
quiver
and
thrill
as
they
had
long
ceased
to
do
under
the
accents
of
popular
oratory
proclaiming
popular
virtue
flattery
had
lost
its
charm
but
the
went
home
adams
had
been
carried
with
the
tide
till
brunhilde
had
become
a
habit
and
ternina
an
ally
he
too
had
played
with
anarchy
though
not
with
socialism
which
to
young
men
who
nourished
artistic
emotions
under
the
dome
of
the
pantheon
seemed
hopelessly
bourgeois
and
lowest
bay
lodge
and
joe
stickney
had
given
birth
to
the
wholly
new
and
original
party
of
conservative
christian
anarchists
to
restore
true
poetry
under
the
inspiration
of
the
gotterdammerung
such
a
party
saw
no
inspiration
in
baireuth
where
landscape
history
and
audience
were
relatively
stodgy
and
where
the
only
emotion
was
a
musical
dilettantism
that
the
master
had
abhorred
yet
baireuth
still
amused
even
a
conservative
christian
anarchist
who
cared
as
little
as
grane
mein
ross
whether
the
singers
sang
false
and
who
came
only
to
learn
what
wagner
had
supposed
himself
to
mean
this
end
attained
as
pleased
frau
wagner
and
the
heiliger
geist
he
was
ready
to
go
on
and
the
senator
yearning
for
sterner
study
pointed
to
a
haven
at
moscow
for
years
adams
had
taught
american
youth
never
to
travel
without
a
senator
who
was
useful
even
in
america
at
times
but
indispensable
in
russia
where
in
anarchists
even
though
conservative
and
christian
were
this
wing
of
the
anarchistic
party
consisted
rigorously
of
but
two
members
adams
and
bay
lodge
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
as
a
party
drew
life
from
hegel
and
schopenhauer
rightly
understood
by
the
necessity
of
their
philosophical
descent
each
member
of
the
fraternity
denounced
the
other
as
unequal
to
his
lofty
task
and
inadequate
to
grasp
it
of
course
no
third
member
could
be
so
much
as
considered
since
the
great
principle
of
contradiction
could
be
expressed
only
by
opposites
and
no
agreement
could
be
conceived
because
anarchy
by
definition
must
be
chaos
and
collision
as
in
the
kinetic
theory
of
a
perfect
gas
doubtless
this
law
of
contradiction
was
itself
agreement
a
restriction
of
personal
liberty
inconsistent
with
freedom
but
the
larger
synthesis
admitted
a
limited
agreement
provided
it
were
strictly
confined
to
the
end
of
larger
contradiction
thus
the
great
end
of
all
philosophy
the
larger
synthesis
was
attained
but
the
process
was
arduous
and
while
adams
as
the
older
member
assumed
to
declare
the
principle
bay
lodge
necessarily
denied
both
the
assumption
and
the
principle
in
order
to
assure
its
truth
adams
proclaimed
that
in
the
last
synthesis
order
and
anarchy
were
one
but
that
the
unity
was
chaos
as
anarchist
conservative
and
christian
he
had
no
motive
or
duty
but
to
attain
the
end
and
to
hasten
it
he
was
bound
to
accelerate
progress
to
concentrate
energy
to
accumulate
power
to
multiply
and
intensify
forces
to
reduce
friction
increase
velocity
and
magnify
momentum
partly
because
this
was
the
mechanical
law
of
the
universe
as
science
explained
it
but
partly
also
in
order
to
get
done
with
the
present
which
artists
and
some
others
complained
of
and
finally
and
chiefly
because
a
rigorous
philosophy
required
it
in
order
to
penetrate
the
beyond
and
satisfy
man
destiny
by
reaching
the
largest
synthesis
in
its
ultimate
contradiction
of
course
the
untaught
critic
instantly
objected
that
this
scheme
was
neither
conservative
christian
nor
anarchic
but
such
objection
meant
only
that
the
critic
should
begin
his
education
in
any
infant
school
in
order
to
learn
that
anarchy
which
should
be
logical
would
cease
to
be
anarchic
to
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
the
amiable
doctrines
of
kropotkin
were
sentimental
ideas
of
russian
mental
inertia
covered
with
the
name
of
anarchy
merely
to
disguise
their
innocence
and
the
outpourings
of
elisee
reclus
were
ideals
of
the
french
ouvrier
diluted
with
absinthe
resulting
in
a
bourgeois
dream
of
order
and
inertia
neither
made
a
pretence
of
anarchy
except
as
a
momentary
stage
towards
order
and
unity
neither
of
them
had
formed
any
other
conception
of
the
universe
than
what
they
had
inherited
from
the
priestly
class
to
which
their
minds
obviously
belonged
with
them
as
with
the
socialist
communist
or
collectivist
the
mind
that
followed
nature
had
no
relation
if
anarchists
needed
order
they
must
go
back
to
the
twelfth
century
where
their
thought
had
enjoyed
its
thousand
years
of
reign
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
could
have
no
associate
no
object
no
faith
except
the
nature
of
nature
itself
and
his
larger
synthesis
had
only
the
fault
of
being
so
supremely
true
that
even
the
highest
obligation
of
duty
could
scarcely
oblige
bay
lodge
to
deny
it
in
order
to
prove
it
only
the
truth
that
no
philosophy
of
order
except
the
church
had
ever
satisfied
the
philosopher
reconciled
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
to
prove
his
own
naturally
these
ideas
were
so
far
in
advance
of
the
age
that
hardly
more
people
could
understand
them
than
understood
wagner
or
hegel
for
that
matter
since
the
time
of
socrates
wise
men
have
been
mostly
shy
of
claiming
to
understand
anything
but
such
refinements
were
greek
or
german
and
affected
the
practical
american
but
little
he
admitted
that
for
the
moment
the
darkness
was
dense
he
could
not
affirm
with
confidence
even
to
himself
that
his
largest
synthesis
would
certainly
turn
out
to
be
chaos
since
he
would
be
equally
obliged
to
deny
the
chaos
the
poet
groped
blindly
for
an
emotion
the
play
of
thought
for
thought
sake
had
mostly
ceased
the
throb
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
million
steam
doubling
every
ten
years
and
already
more
despotic
than
all
the
horses
that
ever
lived
and
all
the
riders
they
ever
carried
drowned
rhyme
and
reason
no
one
was
to
blame
for
all
were
equally
servants
of
the
power
and
worked
merely
to
increase
it
but
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
saw
light
thus
the
student
of
hegel
prepared
himself
for
a
visit
to
russia
in
order
to
enlarge
his
synthesis
and
much
he
needed
it
in
america
all
were
conservative
christian
anarchists
the
faith
was
national
racial
geographic
the
true
american
had
never
seen
such
supreme
virtue
in
any
of
the
innumerable
shades
between
social
anarchy
and
social
order
as
to
mark
it
for
exclusively
human
and
his
own
he
never
had
known
a
complete
union
either
in
church
or
state
or
thought
and
had
never
seen
any
need
for
it
the
freedom
gave
him
courage
to
meet
any
contradiction
and
intelligence
enough
to
ignore
it
exactly
the
opposite
condition
had
marked
russian
growth
the
czar
empire
was
a
phase
of
conservative
christian
anarchy
more
interesting
to
history
than
all
the
complex
variety
of
american
newspapers
schools
trusts
sects
frauds
and
congressmen
these
were
nature
pure
and
anarchic
as
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
saw
nature
active
vibrating
mostly
unconscious
and
quickly
reacting
on
force
but
from
the
first
glimpse
one
caught
from
the
window
in
the
early
morning
of
the
polish
jew
at
the
accidental
railway
station
in
all
his
weird
horror
to
the
last
vision
of
the
russian
peasant
lighting
his
candle
and
kissing
his
ikon
before
the
railway
virgin
in
the
station
at
petersburg
all
was
logical
conservative
christian
and
anarchic
russia
had
nothing
in
common
with
any
ancient
or
modern
world
that
history
knew
she
had
been
the
oldest
source
of
all
civilization
in
europe
and
had
kept
none
for
herself
neither
europe
nor
asia
had
ever
known
such
a
phase
which
seemed
to
fall
into
no
line
of
evolution
whatever
and
was
as
wonderful
to
the
student
of
gothic
architecture
in
the
twelfth
century
as
to
the
student
of
the
dynamo
in
the
twentieth
studied
in
the
dry
light
of
conservative
christian
anarchy
russia
became
luminous
like
the
salt
of
radium
but
with
a
negative
luminosity
as
though
she
were
a
substance
whose
energies
had
been
sucked
out
an
inert
residuum
with
movement
of
pure
inertia
from
the
car
window
one
seemed
to
float
past
undulations
of
nomad
life
herders
deserted
by
their
leaders
and
herds
wandering

their
wanderings
waiting
for
their
winds
or
warriors
to

and
lead

westward
tribes
that
had
camped
like
khirgis
for
the
season
and
had
lost
the
means
of
motion
without
acquiring
the
habit
of
permanence
they
waited
and
suffered
as
they
stood
they
were
out
of
place
and
could
never
have
been
normal
their
country
acted
as
a
sink
of
energy
like
the
caspian
sea
and
its
surface
kept
the
uniformity
of
ice
and
snow
one
russian
peasant
kissing
an
ikon
on
a
saint
day
in
the
kremlin
served
for
a
hundred
million
the
student
had
no
need
to
study
wallace
or
tolstoy
or
tourguenieff
or
dostoiewski
to
refresh
his
memory
of
the
most
poignant
analysis
of
human
inertia
ever
put
in
words
gorky
was
more
than
enough
kropotkin
answered
every
purpose
the
russian
people
could
never
have
changed
could
they
ever
be
changed
could
inertia
of
race
on
such
a
scale
be
broken
up
or
take
new
form
even
in
america
on
an
infinitely
smaller
scale
the
question
was
old
and
unanswered
all
the
primitive
races
and
some
nearer
survivals
had
raised
doubts
which
persisted
against
the
most
obstinate
convictions
of
evolution
the
senator
himself
shook
his
head
and
after
surveying
warsaw
and
moscow
to
his
content
went
on
to
petersburg
to
ask
questions
of
de
witte
and
prince
khilkoff
their
conversation
added
new
doubts
for
their
efforts
had
been
immense
their
expenditure
enormous
and
their
results
on
the
people
seemed
to
be
uncertain
as
yet
even
to
themselves
ten
or
fifteen
years
of
violent
stimulus
seemed
resulting
in
nothing
for
since
russia
lagged
the
having
duly
reflected
asked
the
senator
whether
he
should
allow
three
generations
or
more
to
swing
the
russian
people
into
the
western
movement
the
senator
seemed
disposed
to
ask
for
more
the
student
had
nothing
to
say
for
him
all
opinion
founded
on
fact
must
be
error
because
the
facts
can
never
be
complete
and
their
relations
must
be
always
infinite
very
likely
russia
would
instantly
become
the
most
brilliant
constellation
of
human
progress
through
all
the
ordered
stages
of
good
but
meanwhile
one
might
give
a
value
as
movement
of
inertia
to
the
mass
and
assume
a
slow
acceleration
that
would
at
the
end
of
a
generation
leave
the
gap
between
east
and
west
relatively
the
same
this
result
reached
the
lodges
thought
their
moral
improvement
required
a
visit
to
berlin
but
forty
years
of
varied
emotions
had
not
deadened
adams
memories
of
berlin
and
he
preferred
at
any
cost
to
escape
new
ones
when
the
lodges
started
for
germany
adams
took
steamer
for
sweden
and
landed
happily
in
a
day
or
two
at
stockholm
until
the
student
is
fairly
sure
that
his
problem
is
soluble
he
gains
little
by
obstinately
insisting
on
solving
it
one
might
doubt
whether
de
witte
himself
or
prince
khilkoff
or
any
grand
duke
or
the
emperor
knew
much
more
about
it
than
their
neighbors
and
adams
was
quite
sure
that
even
in
america
he
should
listen
with
uncertain
confidence
to
the
views
of
any
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
railway
president
or
president
of
the
united
states
whom
he
had
ever
known
that
should
concern
the
america
of
the
next
generation
the
mere
fact
that
any
man
should
dare
to
offer
them
would
prove
his
incompetence
to
judge
yet
russia
was
too
vast
a
force
to
be
treated
as
an
object
of
unconcern
as
inertia
if
in
no
other
way
she
represented
of
the
human
race
and
her
movement
might
be
the
true
movement
of
the
future
against
the
hasty
and
unsure
acceleration
of
america
no
one
could
yet
know
what
would
best
suit
humanity
and
the
tourist
who
carried
his
la
fontaine
in
mind
caught
himself
talking
as
bear
or
as
monkey
according
to
the
mirror
he
held
before
him

he
asked

granting
that
his
brother
the
bear
lacked
perfection
in
details
his
own
figure
as
monkey
was
not
necessarily
ideal
or
decorative
nor
was
he
in
the
least
sure
what
form
it
might
take
even
in
one
generation
he
had
himself
never
ventured
to
dream
of
three
no
man
could
guess
what
the
daimler
motor
and
would
do
to
him
but
so
much
was
sure
the
monkey
and
motor
were
terribly
afraid
of
the
bear
how
much
only
a
man
close
to
their
foreign
departments
knew
as
the
monkey
looked
back
across
the
baltic
from
the
safe
battlements
of
stockholm
russia
looked
more
portentous
than
from
the
kremlin
the
image
was
that
of
the
retreating
a
wall
of
archaic
glacier
as
fixed
as
ancient
as
eternal
as
the
wall
of
archaic
ice
that
blocked
the
ocean
a
few
hundred
miles
to
the
northward
and
more
likely
to
advance
scandinavia
had
been
ever
at
its
mercy
europe
had
never
changed
the
imaginary
line
that
crossed
the
level
continent
from
the
baltic
to
the
black
sea
merely
extended
the
northern
the
hungarians
and
poles
on
one
side
still
struggled
against
the
russian
inertia
of
race
and
retained
their
own
energies
under
the
same
conditions
that
caused
inertia
across
the
frontier
race
ruled
the
conditions
conditions
hardly
affected
race
and
yet
no
one
could
tell
the
patient
tourist
what
race
was
or
how
it
should
be
known
history
offered
a
feeble
and
delusive
smile
at
the
sound
of
the
word
evolutionists
and
ethnologists
disputed
its
very
existence
no
one
knew
what
to
make
of
it
yet
without
the
clue
history
was
a
nursery
tale
the
germans
scandinavians
poles
and
hungarians
energetic
as
they
were
had
never
held
their
own
against
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
inertia
called
russia
and
trembled
with
terror
whenever
russia
moved
from
stockholm
one
looked
back
on
it
as
though
it
were
an
and
so
had
stockholm
watched
it
for
centuries
in
contrast
with
the
dreary
forests
of
russia
and
the
stern
streets
of
petersburg
stockholm
seemed
a
southern
vision
and
sweden
lured
the
tourist
on
through
a
cheerful
new
england
landscape
and
bright
autumn
he
rambled
northwards
till
he
found
himself
at
trondhjem
and
discovered
norway
education
crowded
upon
him
in
immense
masses
as
he
triangulated
these
vast
surfaces
of
history
about
which
he
had
lectured
and
read
for
a
when
the
historian
fully
realizes
his
ignorance
which
sometimes
happens
to
americans
he
becomes
even
more
tiresome
to
himself
than
to
others
because
his
naivete
is
irrepressible
adams
could
not
get
over
his
astonishment
though
he
had
preached
the
norse
doctrine
all
his
life
against
the
stupid
and
saxon
boors
whom
freeman
loved
and
who
to
the
despair
of
science
produced
shakespeare
mere
contact
with
norway
started
voyages
of
thought
and
under
their
illusions
he
took
the
mail
steamer
to
the
north
and
on
september
reached
hammerfest
frivolous
amusement
was
hardly
what
one
saw
through
the
equinoctial
twilight
peering
at
the
flying
tourist
down
the
deep
fiords
from
dim
patches
of
snow
where
the
last
laps
and
reindeer
were
watching
the
thread
the
intricate
channels
outside
as
their
ancestors
had
watched
the
first
norse
fishermen
learn
them
in
the
succession
of
time
but
it
was
not
the
laps
or
the
snow
or
the
arctic
gloom
that
impressed
the
tourist
so
much
as
the
lights
of
an
civilization
and
the
stupefying
contrast
with
russia
which
more
and
more
insisted
on
taking
the
first
place
in
historical
interest
nowhere
had
the
new
forces
so
vigorously
corrected
the
errors
of
the
old
or
so
effectively
redressed
the
balance
of
the
ecliptic
as
one
approached
the
end
the
spot
where
seventy
years
before
a
futile
carlylean
teufelsdrockh
had
stopped
to
ask
futile
questions
of
the
silent
infinite
the
infinite
seemed
to
have
become
loquacious
not
to
say
familiar
chattering
gossip
in
one
ear
an
installation
of
electric
lighting
and
telephones
led
tourists
close
up
to
the
polar
beyond
the
level
of
the
magnetic
pole
and
there
the
newer
teufelsdrockh
sat
dumb
with
surprise
and
glared
at
the
permanent
electric
lights
of
hammerfest
he
had
good
reason
better
than
the
teufelsdrockh
of
in
his
liveliest
scotch
imagination
ever
dreamed
or
mortal
man
had
ever
told
at
best
a
week
in
these
dim
northern
seas
without
means
of
speech
within
the
arctic
circle
at
the
equinox
lent
itself
to
gravity
if
not
to
gloom
but
only
a
week
before
breakfasting
in
the
restaurant
at
stockholm
his
eye
had
caught
across
the
neighboring
table
a
headline
in
a
swedish
newspaper
announcing
an
attempt
on
the
life
of
president
mckinley
and
from
stockholm
to
trondhjem
and
so
up
the
coast
to
hammerfest
day
after
day
the
news
came
telling
of
the
president
condition
and
the
doings
and
sayings
of
hay
and
roosevelt
until
at
last
a
little
journal
was
cried
on
reaching
some
dim
haven
announcing
the
president
death
a
few
hours
before
to
adams
the
death
of
mckinley
and
the
advent
of
roosevelt
were
not
wholly
void
of
personal
emotion
but
this
was
little
in
comparison
with
his
depth
of
wonder
at
hearing
hourly
reports
from
his
most
intimate
friends
sent
to
him
far
within
the
realm
of
night
not
to
please
him
but
to
correct
the
faults
of
the
solar
system
the
universe
worked
better
than
the
sun
no
such
strange
chance
had
ever
happened
to
a
historian
before
and
it
upset
for
the
moment
his
whole
philosophy
of
conservative
anarchy
the
acceleration
was
marvellous
and
wholly
in
the
lines
of
unity
to
recover
his
grasp
of
chaos
he
must
look
back
across
the
gulf
to
russia
and
the
gap
seemed
to
have
suddenly
become
an
abyss
russia
was
infinitely
distant
yet
the
nightmare
of
the
glacial
still
pressed
down
on
him
from
the
hills
in
full
vision
and
no
one
could
look
out
on
the
dusky
and
oily
sea
that
lapped
these
spectral
islands
without
consciousness
that
only
a
day
steaming
to
the
northward
would
bring
him
to
the
ready
at
any
moment
to
advance
which
obliged
tourists
to
stop
where
laps
and
reindeer
and
norse
fishermen
had
stopped
so
long
ago
that
memory
of
their
very
origin
was
lost
adams
had
never
before
met
a
ne
plus
ultra
and
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
but
he
felt
at
least
the
emotion
of
his
norwegian
fishermen
ancestors
doubtless
numbering
hundreds
of
thousands
jammed
with
their
faces
to
the
sea
the
ice
on
the
north
the
of
russian
inertia
pressing
from
behind
and
the
ice
a
trifling
danger
compared
with
the
inertia
from
the
day
they
first
followed
the
retreating
round
the
north
cape
down
to
the
present
moment
their
problem
was
the
same
the
new
teufelsdrockh
though
considerably
older
than
the
old
one
saw
no
clearer
into
past
or
future
but
he
was
fully
as
much
perplexed
from
the
archaic
to
the
caspian
sea
a
long
line
of
division
permanent
since
ice
and
inertia
first
took
possession
divided
his
lines
of
force
with
no
relation
to
climate
or
geography
or
soil
the
less
a
tourist
knows
the
fewer
mistakes
he
need
make
for
he
will
not
expect
himself
to
explain
ignorance
a
century
ago
he
carried
letters
and
sought
knowledge
he
knows
that
no
one
knows
he
needs
too
much
and
ignorance
is
learning
he
wandered
south
again
and
came
out
at
kiel
hamburg
bremen
and
cologne
a
mere
glance
showed
him
that
here
was
a
germany
new
to
mankind
hamburg
was
almost
as
american
as
louis
in
forty
years
the
green
rusticity
of
dusseldorf
had
taken
on
the
sooty
grime
of
birmingham
the
rhine
in
resembled
the
rhine

much
as
it
resembled
the
rhine
of
the
salic
franks
cologne
was
a
railway
centre
that
had
completed
its
cathedral
which
bore
an
air
of
a
cathedral
of
chicago
the
thirteenth
century
carefully
catalogued
and
locked
up
was
visible
to
tourists
as
a
kind
of
neanderthal
curiosity
the
rhine
was
more
modern
than
the
hudson
as
might
well
be
since
it
produced
far
more
coal
but
all
this
counted
for
little
beside
the
radical
change
in
the
lines
of
force
in
the
whole
plain
of
northern
europe
as
well
as
the
danube
in
the
south

evident
marks

cologne

a

russia
was
felt
even
more
powerfully
than
france

russia

vanished
and
not
even
france
was
felt
hardly
england
or
america
coal
alone
was
felt
its
stamp
alone
pervaded
the
rhine
district
and
persisted
to
picardy
and
the
stamp
was
the
same
as
that
of
birmingham
and
pittsburgh
the
rhine
produced
the
same
power
and
the
power
produced
the
same
people
the
same
mind
the
same
impulse
for
a
man
years
old
who
had
no
hope
of
earning
a
living
these
three
months
of
education
were
the
most
arduous
he
ever
attempted
and
russia
was
the
most
indigestible
morsel
he
ever
met
but
the
sum
of
it
viewed
from
cologne
seemed
reasonable
from
hammerfest

cherbourg

the

the

gained
that
ground
beyond

russia

there
an
older
perhaps
a
surer
power
resting
on

the
height
of

america
has
always
taken
tragedy
lightly
too
busy
to
stop
the
activity
of
their
society
americans
ignore
tragic
motives
that
would
have
overshadowed
the
middle
ages
and
the
world
learns
to
regard
assassination
as
a
form
of
hysteria
and
death
as
neurosis
to
be
treated
by
a
three
hideous
political
murders
that
would
have
fattened
the
eumenides
with
horror
have
thrown
scarcely
a
shadow
on
the
white
house
the
year
was
a
year
of
tragedy
that
seemed
to
hay
to
centre
on
himself
first
came
in

the
accidental
death
of
his
son
del
hay
close
on
the
tragedy
of
his
son
followed
that
of
his
chief
all
the
more
hideous
that
we
were
so
sure
of
his
recovery

turned
suddenly

acquired

nicolay

i
went
to
see
him
yesterday
and
he
did
not
know
me
among
the
letters
of
condolence
showered
upon
him
was
one
from
clarence
king
at
pasadena
in
grace
and
tenderness
the
old
king
manner
and
king
himself
simply
waiting
till
nature
and
the
foe
have
done
their
struggle
the
tragedy
of
king
impressed
him
intensely
there
you
have
it
in
the
face
he
said
the
best
and
brightest
man
of
his
generation
with
talents
immeasurably
beyond
any
of
his
contemporaries
with
industry
that
has
often
sickened
me
to
witness
it
with
everything
in
his
favor
but
blind
luck
hounded
by
disaster
from
his
cradle
with
none
of
the
joy
of

to
which
he
was
entitled

at
last

nameless
suffering

the
first
summons
that
met
adams
before
he
had
even
landed
on
the
pier
at
new
york
december
was
to
clarence
king
funeral
and
from
the
funeral
service
he
had
no
gayer
road
to
travel
than
that
which
led
to
washington
where
a
revolution
had
occurred
that
must
in
any
case
have
made
the
men
of
his
age
instantly
old
but
which
besides
hurrying
to
the
front
the
generation
that
till
then
he
had
regarded
as
boys
could
not
fail
to
break

had

held
them

the
lessons
of

were
becoming
too
trite
hay
himself
probably
for
the
first
time
felt
half
glad
that
roosevelt
should
want
him
to
stay
in
office
if
only
to
save
himself
the
trouble
of
quitting
but
to
adams
all
was
pure
loss
on
that
side
his
education
had
been
finished
at
school
his
friends
in
power
were
lost
and
he
knew
life
too
well
to
risk
total
wreck
by
trying
to
save
them
as
far
as
concerned
roosevelt
the
chance
was
hopeless
to
them
at
roosevelt
at
could
not
be
taken
seriously
in
his
old
character
and
could
not
be
recovered

his
new

when
wielded
by
abnormal
energy
is
the
most
serious
of
facts
and
all
roosevelt
friends
know
that
his
restless
and
combative
energy
was
more
than
abnormal
roosevelt
more
than
any
other
man
living
within
the
range
of
notoriety

the
singular
primitive
quality
that
belongs

the
quality
that
mediaeval
theology
assigned

was
pure

with
him
wielding
unmeasured
power
with
immeasurable
energy
in

the

are
little
valuable
now
but
human
nature
retains
a
few
of
its
archaic
proverbial
laws
and
the
wisest
courtier
that
ever
lived
lucius
seneca
himself
must
have
remained
in
some
shade
of
doubt
what
advantage
he
should
get
from
the
power
of
his
friend
and
pupil
nero
claudius
until
as
a
gentleman
past
sixty
he
received
nero
filial
invitation
to
kill
himself
seneca
closed
the
vast
circle
of
his
knowledge
by
learning
that
a
friend
in
power
was
a
friend
lost
a
fact
very
much
worth
insisting
upon
while
the
moth
that
had
fluttered
through
many
and
had
singed
his
wings
more
or
less
in
them
all
though
he
now
slept
nine
months
out
of
the
twelve
acquired
an
instinct
of
that
kept
him
to
the
north
side
of
la
fayette
square
and
after
a
sufficient
habitude
of
presidents
and
senators
deterred
him
from
hovering
between
them
those
who
seek
education
in
the
paths
of
duty
are
always
deceived
by
the
illusion
that
power
in
the
hands
of
friends
is
an
advantage
to
them
as
far
as
adams
could
teach
experience
he
was
bound
to
warn
them
that
he
had
found
it
an
invariable
disaster
power
is
poison
its
effect
on
presidents
had
been
always
tragic
chiefly
as
an
almost
insane
excitement
at
first
and
a
worse
reaction
afterwards
but
also
because
no
mind
is
so
well
balanced
as
to
bear
the
strain
of
seizing
unlimited
force
without
habit
or
knowledge
of
it
and
finding
it
disputed
with
him
by
hungry
packs
of
wolves
and
hounds
whose
lives
depend
on
snatching
the
carrion
roosevelt
enjoyed
a
singularly
direct
nature
and
honest
intent
but
he
lived
naturally
in
restless
agitation
that
would
have
worn
out
most
tempers
in
a
month
and
his
first
year
of
presidency
showed
chronic
excitement
that
made
a
friend
tremble
the
effect
of
unlimited
power
on
limited
mind
is
worth
noting
in
presidents
because
it
must
represent
the
same
process
in
society
and
the
power
of
must
have
limit
somewhere
in
face
of
the
control
of
the
infinite
here
education
seemed
to
see
its
first
and
last
lesson
but
this
is
a
matter
of
psychology
which
lies
far
down
in
the
depths
of
history
and
of
science
it
will
recur
in
other
forms
the
personal
lesson
is
different
roosevelt
was
lost
but
this
seemed
no
reason
why
hay
and
lodge
should
also
be
lost
yet
the
result
was
mathematically
certain
with
hay
it
was
only
the
steady
decline
of
strength
and
the
necessary
economy
of
force
but
with
lodge
it
was
law
of
politics
he
could
not
help
himself
for
his
position
as
the
president
friend
and
independent
statesman
at
once
was
false
and
he
must
be
unsure
in
both
relations
to
a
student
the
importance
of
cabot
lodge
was
great
much
greater
than
that
of
the
usual
senator
but
it
hung
on
his
position
in
massachusetts
rather
than
on
his
control
of
executive
patronage
and
his
standing
in
massachusetts
was
highly
insecure
nowhere
in
america
was
society
so
complex
or
change
so
rapid
no
doubt
the
bostonian
had
always
been
noted
for
a
certain
chronic
irritability
a
sort
of
bostonitis
which
in
its
primitive
puritan
forms
seemed
due
to
knowing
too
much
of
his
neighbors
and
thinking
too
much
of
himself
many
years
earlier
william
evarts
had
pointed
out
to
adams
the
impossibility
of
uniting
new
england
behind
a
new
england
leader
the
trait
led
to
good
ends
such
as
admiration
of
abraham
lincoln
and
george
washington
but
the
virtue
was
exacting
for
new
england
standards
were
various
scarcely
reconcilable
with
each
other
and
constantly
multiplying
in
number
until
balance
between
them
threatened
to
become
impossible
the
old
ones
were
quite
difficult
enough
state
street
and
the
banks
exacted
one
stamp
the
old
congregational
clergy
another
harvard
college
poor
in
votes
but
rich
in
social
influence
a
third
the
foreign
element
especially
the
irish
held
aloof
and
seldom
consented
to
approve
any
one
the
new
socialist
class
rapidly
growing
promised
to
become
more
exclusive
than
the
irish
new
power
was
disintegrating
society
and
setting
independent
centres
of
force
to
work
until
money
had
all
it
could
do
to
hold
the
machine
together
no
one
could
represent
it
faithfully
as
a
whole
naturally
adams
sympathies
lay
strongly
with
lodge
but
the
task
of
appreciation
was
much
more
difficult
in
his
case
than
in
that
of
his
chief
friend
and
scholar
the
president
as
a
type
for
study
or
a
standard
for
education
lodge
was
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
roosevelts
are
born
and
never
can
be
taught
but
lodge
was
a
creature
of
teaching
boston
incarnate
the
child
of
his
local
parentage
and
while
his
ambition
led
him
to
be
more
the
intent
though
virtuous
was
as
adams
admitted
in
his
own
case
restless
an
excellent
talker
a
voracious
reader
a
ready
wit
an
accomplished
orator
with
a
clear
mind
and
a
powerful
memory
he
could
never
feel
perfectly
at
ease
whatever
leg
he
stood
on
but
shifted
sometimes
with
painful
strain
of
temper
from
one
sensitive
muscle
to
another
uncertain
whether
to
pose
as
an
uncompromising
yankee
or
a
pure
american
or
a
patriot
in
the
still
purer
atmosphere
of
irish
germans
or
jews
or
a
scholar
and
historian
of
harvard
college
english
to
the
last
fibre
of
his
thought
saturated
with
english
literature
english
tradition
english
taste
revolted
by
every
vice
and
by
most
virtues
of
frenchmen
and
germans
or
any
other
continental
standards
but
at
home
and
happy
among
the
vices
and
extravagances
of
shakespeare
standing
first
on
the
social
then
on
the
political
foot
now
worshipping
now
banning
shocked
by
the
wanton
display
of
immorality
but
practicing
the
license
of
political
usage
sometimes
bitter
often
genial
always
intelligent
lodge
had
the
singular
merit
of
interesting
the
usual
statesmen
flocked
in
swarms
like
crows
black
and
monotonous
plumage
was
varied
and
like
his
flight
harked
back
to
race
he
betrayed
the
consciousness
that
he
and
his
people
had
a
past
if
they
dared
but
avow
it
and
might
have
a
future
if
they
could
but
divine
it
adams
too
was
bostonian
and
the
bostonian
uncertainty
of
attitude
was
as
natural
to
him
as
to
lodge
only
bostonians
can
understand
bostonians
and
thoroughly
sympathize
with
the
inconsequences
of
the
boston
mind
his
theory
and
practice
were
also
at
variance
he
professed
in
theory
equal
distrust
of
english
thought
and
called
it
a
huge
of
sometimes
precious
but
never
sure
for
him
only
the
greek
the
italian
or
the
french
standards
had
claims
to
respect
and
the
barbarism
of
shakespeare
was
as
flagrant
as
to
voltaire
but
his
theory
never
affected
his
practice
he
knew
that
his
artistic
standard
was
the
illusion
of
his
own
mind
that
english
disorder
approached
nearer
to
truth
if
truth
existed
than
french
measure
or
italian
line
or
german
logic
he
read
his
shakespeare
as
the
evangel
of
conservative
christian
anarchy
neither
very
conservative
nor
very
christian
but
stupendously
anarchistic
he
loved
the
atrocities
of
english
art
and
society
as
he
loved
charles
dickens
and
miss
austen
not
because
of
their
example
but
because
of
their
humor
he
made
no
scruple
of
defying
sequence
and
denying
consistency
but
he
was
not
a
senator
double
standards
are
inspiration
to
men
of
letters
but
they
are
apt
to
be
fatal
to
politicians
adams
had
no
reason
to
care
whether
his
standards
were
popular
or
not
and
no
one
else
cared
more
than
he
but
roosevelt
and
lodge
were
playing
a
game
in
which
they
were
always
liable
to
find
the
shifty
sands
of
american
opinion
yield
suddenly
under
their
feet
with
this
game
an
elderly
friend
had
long
before
carried
acquaintance
as
far
as
he
wished
there
was
nothing
in
it
for
him
but
the
amusement
of
the
pugilist
or
acrobat
the
larger
study
was
lost
in
the
division
of
interests
and
the
ambitions
of
men
but
foreign
affairs
dealt
only
with
large
units
and
made
personal
relation
possible
with
hay
which
could
not
be
maintained
with
roosevelt
or
lodge
as
an
affair
of
pure
education
the
point
is
worth
notice
from
young
men
who
are
drawn
into
politics
the
work
of
domestic
progress
is
done
by
masses
of
mechanical
power
steam
electric
furnace
or
other
which
have
to
be
controlled
by
a
score
or
two
of
individuals
who
have
shown
capacity
to
manage
it
the
work
of
internal
government
has
become
the
task
of
controlling
these
men
who
are
socially
as
remote
as
heathen
gods
alone
worth
knowing
but
never
known
and
who
could
tell
nothing
of
political
value
if
one
skinned
them
alive
most
of
them
have
nothing
to
tell
but
are
forces
as
dumb
as
their
dynamos
absorbed
in
the
development
or
economy
of
power
they
are
trustees
for
the
public
and
whenever
society
assumes
the
property
it
must
confer
on
them
that
title
but
the
power
will
remain
as
before
whoever
manages
it
and
will
then
control
society
without
appeal
as
it
controls
its
stokers
and
modern
politics
is
at
bottom
a
struggle
not
of
men
but
of
forces
the
men
become
every
year
more
and
more
creatures
of
force
massed
about
central
the
conflict
is
no
longer
between
the
men
but
between
the
motors
that
drive
the
men
and
the
men
tend
to
succumb
to
their
own
motive
forces
this
is
a
moral
that
man
strongly
objects
to
admit
especially
in
mediaeval
pursuits
like
politics
and
poetry
nor
is
it
worth
while
for
a
teacher
to
insist
upon
it
what
he
insists
upon
is
only
that
in
domestic
politics
every
one
works
for
an
immediate
object
commonly
for
some
private
job
and
invariably
in
a
near
horizon
while
in
foreign
affairs
the
outlook
is
far
ahead
over
a
field
as
wide
as
the
world
there
the
merest
scholar
could
see
what
he
was
doing
for
history
international
relations
are
the
only
sure
standards
of
movement
the
only
foundation
for
a
map
for
this
reason
adams
had
always
insisted
that
international
relation
was
the
only
sure
base
for
a
chart
of
history
he
cared
little
to
convince
any
one
of
the
correctness
of
his
view
but
as
teacher
he
was
bound
to
explain
it
and
as
friend
he
found
it
convenient
the
secretary
of
state
has
always
stood
as
much
alone
as
the
historian
required
to
look
far
ahead
and
round
him
he
measures
forces
unknown
to
party
managers
and
has
found
congress
more
or
less
hostile
ever
since
congress
first
sat
the
secretary
of
state
exists
only
to
recognize
the
existence
of
a
world
which
congress
would
rather
ignore
of
obligations
which
congress
repudiates
whenever
it
can
of
bargains
which
congress
distrusts
and
tries
to
turn
to
its
advantage
or
to
reject
since
the
first
day
the
senate
existed
it
has
always
intrigued
against
the
secretary
of
state
whenever
the
secretary
has
been
obliged
to
extend
his
functions
beyond
the
appointment
of
consuls
in
senators
service
this
is
a
matter
of
history
which
any
one
may
approve
or
dispute
as
he
will
but
as
education
it
gave
new
resources
to
an
old
scholar
for
it
made
of
hay
the
best
schoolmaster
since
hay
had
become
the
most
imposing
figure
ever
known
in
the
office
he
had
an
influence
that
no
other
secretary
of
state
ever
possessed
as
he
had
a
nation
behind
him
such
as
history
had
never
imagined
he
needed
to
write
no
state
papers
he
wanted
no
help
and
he
stood
far
above
counsel
or
advice
but
he
could
instruct
an
attentive
scholar
as
no
other
teacher
in
the
world
could
do
and
adams
sought
only
instruction
wanted
only
to
chart
the
international
channel
for
fifty
years
to
come
to
triangulate
the
future
to
obtain
his
dimension
and
fix
the
acceleration
of
movement
in
politics
since
the
year
as
he
was
trying
to
fix
it
in
philosophy
and
physics
in
finance
and
force
hay
had
been
so
long
at
the
head
of
foreign
affairs
that
at
last
the
stream
of
events
favored
him
with
infinite
effort
he
had
achieved
the
astonishing
diplomatic
feat
of
inducing
the
senate
with
only
six
negative
votes
to
permit
great
britain
to
renounce
without
equivalent
treaty
rights
which
she
had
for
fifty
years
defended
tooth
and
nail
this
unprecedented
triumph
in
his
negotiations
with
the
senate
enabled
him
to
carry
one
step
further
his
measures
for
general
peace
about
england
the
senate
could
make
no
further
effective
opposition
for
england
was
won
and
canada
alone
could
give
trouble
the
next
difficulty
was
with
france
and
there
the
senate
blocked
advance
but
england
assumed
the
task
and
owing
to
political
changes
in
france
effected
the
object
a
combination
which
as
late
as
had
been
visionary
the
next
and
far
more
difficult
step
was
to
bring
germany
into
the
combine
while
at
the
end
of
the
vista
most
unmanageable
of
all
russia
remained
to
be
satisfied
and
disarmed
this
was
the
instinct
of
what
might
be
named
mckinleyism
the
system
of
combinations
consolidations
trusts
realized
at
home
and
realizable
abroad
with
the
system
a
student
nurtured
in
ideas
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
nothing
to
do
and
made
not
the
least
presence
of
meddling
but
nothing
forbade
him
to
study
and
he
noticed
to
his
astonishment
that
this
capitalistic
scheme
of
combining
governments
like
railways
or
furnaces
was
in
effect
precisely
the
socialist
scheme
of
jaures
and
bebel
that
john
hay
of
all
men
should
adopt
a
socialist
policy
seemed
an
idea
more
absurd
than
conservative
christian
anarchy
but
paradox
had
become
the
only
orthodoxy
in
politics
as
in
science
when
one
saw
the
field
one
realized
that
hay
could
not
help
himself
nor
could
bebel
either
germany
must
destroy
england
and
france
to
create
the
next
inevitable
unification
as
a
system
of
continent
against
continent
or
she
must
pool
interests
both
schemes
in
turn
were
attributed
to
the
kaiser
one
or
the
other
he
would
have
to
choose
opinion
was
balanced
doubtfully
on
their
merits
but
granting
both
to
be
feasible
hay
and
mckinley
statesmanship
turned
on
the
point
of
persuading
the
kaiser
to
join
what
might
be
called
the
combination
rather
than
build
up
the
only
possible
alternative
a
combination
by
merging
germany
in
russia
thus
bebel
and
jaures
mckinley
and
hay
were
partners
the
problem
was
pretty
even
fascinating
and
to
an
old
private
soldier
in
diplomacy
as
rigorous
as
a
geometrical
demonstration
as
the
last
possible
lesson
in
life
it
had
all
sorts
of
ultimate
values
unless
education
marches
on
both
feet
theory
and
practice
it
risks
going
astray
and
hay
was
probably
the
most
accomplished
master
of
both
then
living
he
knew
not
only
the
forces
but
also
the
men
and
he
had
no
other
thought
than
his
policy
probably
this
was
the
moment
of
highest
knowledge
that
a
scholar
could
ever
reach
he
had
under
his
eyes
the
whole
educational
staff
of
the
government
at
a
time
when
the
government
had
just
reached
the
heights
of
highest
activity
and
influence
since
education
had
done
its
worst
under
the
greatest
masters
and
at
enormous
expense
to
the
world
to
train
these
two
minds
to
catch
and
comprehend
every
spring
of
international
action
not
to
speak
of
personal
influence
and
the
entire
machinery
of
politics
in
several
great
countries
had
little
to
do
but
supply
the
last
and
best
information
education
could
be
carried
no
further
with
its
effects
on
hay
adams
had
nothing
to
do
but
its
effects
on
himself
were
grotesque
never
had
the
proportions
of
his
ignorance
looked
so
appalling
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
to
be
groping
in
darkness
to
be
falling
forever
in
space
and
the
worst
depth
consisted
in
the
assurance
incredible
as
it
seemed
that
no
one
knew
more
he
had
at
least
the
mechanical
assurance
of
certain
values
to
guide
him
like
the
relative
intensities
of
his
and
relative
inertia
of
his
but
he
conceived
that
had
he
known
besides
the
mechanics
every
relative
value
of
persons
as
well
as
he
knew
the
inmost
thoughts
of
his
own
government
had
the
czar
and
the
kaiser
and
the
mikado
turned
schoolmasters
like
hay
and
taught
him
all
they
knew
he
would
still

the
abyss
of
ignorance
the
years
hurried
past
and
gave
hardly
time
to
note
their
work
three
or
four
months
though
big
with

to
an
end

not
for

cameron

in
the
summer
of
scotland
put
on
fewer
airs
of
coquetry
than
usual
since
the
terrible
harvest
of
which
one
had
watched
sprouting
on
its
stalks
on
the

hillsides
nothing
had
equalled
the
gloom
even
when
the

fled

they
found
the

no
more

than

until
at

in
desperation
one
drifted
back
to

like

dropped

abandoned

there
for

he
hid
in
ignorance
and
silence
life
at
last
managed
of
its
own
accord
to
settle
itself
into
a
working
arrangement
after
so
many
years
of
effort
to
find
one
drift
the
drift
found
the
seeker
and
slowly
swept
him
forward
and
back
with
a
steady
progress
oceanwards
such
lessons
as
summer
taught
winter
tested
and
one
had
only
to
watch
the
apparent
movement
of
the
stars
in
order
to
guess
one
declination
the
process
is
possible
only
for
men
who
have
exhausted
adams
never
knew
why
knowing
nothing
of
faraday
he
began
to
mimic
faraday
trick
of
seeing
lines
of
force
all
about
him
where
he
had
always
seen
lines
of
will
perhaps
the
effect
of
knowing
no
mathematics
is
to
leave
the
mind
to
imagine
figures
images
phantoms
one
mind
is
a
watery
mirror
at
best
but
once
conceived
the
image
became
rapidly
simple
and
the
lines
of
force
presented
themselves
as
lines
of
attraction
repulsions
counted
only
as
battle
of
attractions
by
this
path
the
mind
stepped
into
the
mechanical
theory
of
the
universe
before
knowing
it
and
entered
a
distinct
new
phase
of
education
this
was
the
work
of
the
dynamo
and
the
virgin
of
chartres
like
his
masters
since
thought
began
he
was
handicapped
by
the
eternal
mystery
of
force
the
sink
of
all
science
for
thousands
of
years
in
history
he
found
that
force
had
been
felt
as
occult
attraction
love
of
god
and
lust
for
power
in
a
future
life
after
when
this
attraction
began
to
decline
philosophers
fell
back
on
some
vis
a
tergo
instinct
of
danger
from
behind
like
survival
of
the
fittest
and
one
of
the
greatest
minds
between
descartes
and
newton
pascal
saw
the
of
man
in
ennui
which
was
also
scientific
i
have
often
said
that
all
the
troubles
of
man
come
from
his
not
knowing
how
to
sit
still
mere
restlessness
forces
action
so
passes
the
whole
of
life
we
combat
obstacles
in
order
to
get
repose
and
when
got
the
repose
is
insupportable
for
we
think
either
of
the
troubles
we
have
or
of
those
that
threaten
us
and
even
if
we
felt
safe
on
every
side
ennui
would
of
its
own
accord
spring
up
from
the
depths
of
the
heart
where
it
is
rooted
by
nature
and
would
fill
the
mind
with
its
venom
if
goodness
lead
him
not
yet
weariness
may
toss
him
to
my
breast
ennui
like
natural
selection
accounted
for
change
but
failed
to
account
for
direction
of
change
for
that
an
attractive
force
was
essential
a
force
from
outside
a
shaping
influence
pascal
and
all
the
old
philosophies
called
this
outside
force
god
or
gods
caring
but
little
for
the
name
and
fixed
only
on
tracing
the
force
adams
had
gone
straight
to
the
virgin
at
chartres
and
asked
her
to
show
him
god
face
to
face
as
she
did
for
bernard
she
replied
kindly
as
ever
as
though
she
were
still
the
young
mother
of
with
a
sort
of
patient
pity
for
masculine
dulness
my
dear
outcast
what
is
it
you
seek
this
is
the
church
of
christ
if
you
seek
him
through
me
you
are
welcome
sinner
or
saint
but
he
and
i
are
one
we
are
love
we
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
god
other
energies
which
are
infinite
and
concern
us
the
less
because
our
interest
is
only
in
man
and
the
infinite
is
not
knowable
to
man
yet
if
you
are
troubled
by
your
ignorance
you
see
how
i
am
surrounded
by
the
masters
of
the
schools
ask
them
the
answer
sounded
singularly
like
the
usual
answer
of
british
science
which
had
repeated
since
bacon
that
one
must
not
try
to
know
the
unknowable
though
one
was
quite
powerless
to
ignore
it
but
the
virgin
carried
more
conviction
for
her
feminine
lack
of
interest
in
all
perfections
except
her
own
was
honester
than
the
formal
phrase
of
science
since
nothing
was
easier
than
to
follow
her
advice
and
turn
to
thomas
aquinas
who
unlike
modern
physicists
answered
at
once
and
plainly
to
me
said
thomas
christ
and
the
mother
are
one
force
love
simple
single
and
sufficient
for
all
human
wants
but
love
is
a
human
interest
which
acts
even
on
man
so
partially
that
you
and
i
as
philosophers
need
expect
no
share
in
it
therefore
we
turn
to
christ
and
the
schools
who
represent
all
other
force
we
deal
with
multiplicity
and
call
it
god
after
the
virgin
has
redeemed
by
her
personal
force
as
love
all
that
is
redeemable
in
man
the
schools
embrace
the
rest
and
give
it
form
unity
and
motive
this
chart
of
force
was
more
easily
studied
than
any
other
possible
scheme
for
one
had
but
to
do
what
the
church
was
always
promising
to
do
abolish
in
one
flash
of
lightning
not
only
man
but
also
the
church
itself
the
earth
the
other
planets
and
the
sun
in
order
to
clear
the
air
without
affecting
mediaeval
science
the
student
felt
warranted
in
doing
what
the
church
threatened
abolishing
his
solar
system
altogether
in
order
to
look
at
god
as
actual
continuous
movement
universal
cause
and
interchangeable
force
this
was
pantheism
but
the
schools
were
pantheist
at
least
as
pantheistic
as
the
energetik
of
the
germans
and
their
deity
was
the
ultimate
energy
whose
thought
and
act
were
one
rid
of
man
and
his
mind
the
universe
of
thomas
aquinas
seemed
rather
more
scientific
than
that
of
haeckel
or
ernst
mach
contradiction
for
contradiction
attraction
for
attraction
energy
for
energy
thomas
idea
of
god
had
merits
modern
science
offered
not
a
vestige
of
proof
or
a
theory
of
connection
between
its
forces
or
any
scheme
of
reconciliation
between
thought
and
mechanics
while
thomas
at
least
linked
together
the
joints
of
his
machine
as
far
as
a
superficial
student
could
follow
the
thirteenth
century
supposed
mind
to
be
a
mode
of
force
directly
derived
from
the
intelligent
prime
motor
and
the
cause
of
all
form
and
sequence
in
the
universe
therefore
the
only
proof
of
unity
without
thought
in
the
unit
there
could
be
no
unity
without
unity
no
orderly
sequence
or
ordered
society
thought
alone
was
form
mind
and
unity
flourished
or
perished
together
this
education
startled
even
a
man
who
had
dabbled
in
fifty
educations
all
over
the
world
for
if
he
were
obliged
to
insist
on
a
universe
he
seemed
driven
to
the
church
modern
science
guaranteed
no
unity
the
student
seemed
to
feel
himself
like
all
his
predecessors
caught
trapped
meshed
in
this
eternal
of
religion
in
practice
the
student
escapes
this
dilemma
in
two
ways
the
first
is
that
of
ignoring
it
as
one
escapes
most
dilemmas
the
second
is
that
the
church
rejects
pantheism
as
worse
than
atheism
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
pantheist
at
any
price
in
wandering
through
the
forests
of
ignorance
one
necessarily
fell
upon
the
famous
old
bear
that
scared
children
at
play
but
even
had
the
animal
shown
more
logic
than
its
victim
one
had
learned
from
socrates
to
distrust
above
all
other
traps
the
trap
of
logic
the
mirror
of
the
mind
yet
the
search
for
a
unit
of
force
led
into
catacombs
of
thought
where
hundreds
of
thousands
of
educations
had
found
their
end
generation
after
generation
of
painful
and
scholars
had
been
content
to
stay
in
these
labyrinths
forever
pursuing
ignorance
in
silence
in
company
with
the
most
famous
teachers
of
all
time
not
one
of
them
had
ever
found
a
logical
highroad
of
escape
adams
cared
little
whether
he
escaped
or
not
but
he
felt
clear
that
he
could
not
stop
there
even
to
enjoy
the
society
of
spinoza
and
thomas
aquinas
true
the
church
alone
had
asserted
unity
with
any
conviction
and
the
historian
alone
knew
what
oceans
of
blood
and
treasure
the
assertion
had
cost
but
the
only
honest
alternative
to
affirming
unity
was
to
deny
it
and
the
denial
would
require
a
new
education
at
years
old
a
new
education
promised
hardly
more
than
the
old
possibly
the
modern
legislator
or
magistrate
might
no
longer
know
enough
to
treat
as
the
church
did
the
man
who
denied
unity
unless
the
denial
took
the
form
of
a
bomb
but
no
teacher
would
know
how
to
explain
what
he
thought
he
meant
by
denying
unity
society
would
certainly
punish
the
denial
if
ever
any
one
learned
enough
to
understand
it
philosophers
as
a
rule
cared
little
what
principles
society
affirmed
or
denied
since
the
philosopher
commonly
held
that
though
he
might
sometimes
be
right
by
good
luck
on
some
one
point
no
complex
of
individual
opinions
could
possibly
be
anything
but
wrong
yet
supposing
society
to
be
ignored
the
philosopher
was
no
further
forward
nihilism
had
no
bottom
for
thousands
of
years
every
philosopher
had
stood
on
the
shore
of
this
sunless
sea
diving
for
pearls
and
never
finding
them
all
had
seen
that
since
they
could
not
find
bottom
they
must
assume
it
the
church
claimed
to
have
found
it
but
since
motives
for
agreeing
on
some
new
assumption
of
unity
broader
and
deeper
than
that
of
the
church
had
doubled
in
force
until
even
the
universities
and
schools
like
the
church
and
state
seemed
about
to
be
driven
into
an
attempt
to
educate
though
specially
forbidden
to
do
it
like
most
of
his
generation
adams
had
taken
the
word
of
science
that
the
new
unit
was
as
good
as
found
it
would
not
be
an
intelligence
probably
not
even
a
consciousness
but
it
would
serve
he
passed
sixty
years
waiting
for
it
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
on
reviewing
the
ground
he
was
led
to
think
that
the
final
synthesis
of
science
and
its
ultimate
triumph
was
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
which
seemed
to
cover
all
motion
in
space
and
to
furnish
the
measure
of
time
so
far
as
he
understood
it
the
theory
asserted
that
any
portion
of
space
is
occupied
by
molecules
of
gas
flying
in
right
lines
at
velocities
varying
up
to
a
mile
in
a
second
and
colliding
with
each
other
at
intervals
varying
up
to
times
in
a
second
to
this
analysis
if
one
understood
it
right
all
matter
whatever
was
reducible
and
the
only
difference
of
opinion
in
science
regarded
the
doubt
whether
a
still
deeper
analysis
would
reduce
the
atom
of
gas
to
pure
motion
thus
unless
one
mistook
the
meaning
of
motion
which
might
well
be
the
scientific
synthesis
commonly
called
unity
was
the
scientific
analysis
commonly
called
multiplicity
the
two
things
were
the
same
all
forms
being
shifting
phases
of
motion
granting
this
ocean
of
colliding
atoms
the
last
hope
of
humanity
what
happened
if
one
dropped
the
sounder
into
the
abyss
let
it
go
frankly
gave
up
unity
altogether
what
was
unity
why
was
one
to
be
forced
to
affirm
it
here
everybody
flatly
refused
help
science
seemed
content
with
its
old
phrase
of
larger
synthesis
which
was
well
enough
for
science
but
meant
chaos
for
man
one
would
have
been
glad
to
stop
and
ask
no
more
but
the
anarchist
bomb
bade
one
go
on
and
the
bomb
is
a
powerful
persuader
one
could
not
stop
even
to
enjoy
the
charms
of
a
perfect
gas
colliding
seventeen
million
times
in
a
second
much
like
an
automobile
in
paris
science
itself
had
been
crowded
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
that
its
attempts
to
escape
were
as
metaphysical
as
the
leap
while
an
ignorant
old
man
felt
no
motive
for
trying
to
escape
seeing
that
the
only
escape
possible
lay
in
the
form
of
vis
a
tergo
commonly
called
death
he
got
out
his
descartes
again
dipped
into
his
hume
and
berkeley
wrestled
anew
with
his
kant
pondered
solemnly
over
his
hegel
and
schopenhauer
and
hartmann
strayed
gaily
away
with
his
greeks
all
merely
to
ask
what
unity
meant
and
what
happened
when
one
denied
it
apparently
one
never
denied
it
every
philosopher
whether
sane
or
insane
naturally
affirmed
it
the
utmost
flight
of
anarchy
seemed
to
have
stopped
with
the
assertion
of
two
principles
and
even
these
fitted
into
each
other
like
good
and
evil
light
and
darkness
pessimism
itself
black
as
it
might
be
painted
had
been
content
to
turn
the
universe
of
contradictions
into
the
human
thought
as
one
will
and
treat
it
as
representation
metaphysics
insisted
on
treating
the
universe
as
one
thought
or
treating
thought
as
one
universe
and
philosophers
agreed
like
a
kinetic
gas
that
the
universe
could
be
known
only
as
motion
of
mind
and
therefore
as
unity
one
could
know
it
only
as
one
self
it
was
psychology
of
all
forms
of
pessimism
the
metaphysical
form
was
for
a
historian
the
least
enticing
of
all
studies
the
one
he
would
rather
have
avoided
was
that
of
his
own
mind
he
knew
no
tragedy
so
heartrending
as
introspection
and
the
more
because
as
mephistopheles
said
of
marguerite
he
was
not
the
first
nearly
all
the
highest
intelligence
known
to
history
had
drowned
itself
in
the
reflection
of
its
own
thought
and
the
bovine
survivors
had
rudely
told
the
truth
about
it
without
affecting
the
intelligent
one
own
time
had
not
been
exempt
even
since
friends
by
scores
had
fallen
victims
to
it
within
years
a
new
library
had
grown
out
of
it
harvard
college
was
a
focus
of
the
study
france
supported
hospitals
for
it
england
published
magazines
of
it
nothing
was
easier
than
to
take
one
mind
in
one
hand
and
ask
one
psychological
friends
what
they
made
of
it
and
the
more
because
it
mattered
so
little
to
either
party
since
their
minds
whatever
they
were
had
pretty
nearly
ceased
to
reflect
and
let
them
do
what
they
liked
with
the
small
remnant
they
could
scarcely
do
anything
very
new
with
it
all
one
asked
was
to
learn
what
they
hoped
to
do
unfortunately
the
pursuit
of
ignorance
in
silence
had
by
this
time
led
the
weary
pilgrim
into
such
mountains
of
ignorance
that
he
could
no
longer
see
any
path
whatever
and
could
not
even
understand
a
signpost
he
failed
to
fathom
the
depths
of
the
new
psychology
which
proved
to
him
that
on
that
side
as
on
the
mathematical
side
his
power
of
thought
was
atrophied
if
indeed
it
ever
existed
since
he
could
not
fathom
the
science
he
could
only
ask
the
simplest
of
questions
did
the
new
psychology
hold
that
the
ivxn
soul
or
mind
was
or
was
not
a
unit
he
gathered
from
the
books
that
the
psychologists
had
in
a
few
cases
distinguished
several
personalities
in
the
same
mind
each
conscious
and
constant
individual
and
exclusive
the
fact
seemed
scarcely
surprising
since
it
had
been
a
habit
of
mind
from
earliest
recorded
time
and
equally
familiar
to
the
last
acquaintance
who
had
taken
a
drug
or
caught
a
fever
or
eaten
a
welsh
rarebit
before

for
surely
no
one
could
follow
the
action
of
a
vivid
dream
and
still
need
to
be
told
that
the
actors
evoked
by
his
mind
were
not
himself
but
quite
unknown
to
all
he
had
ever
recognized
as
self
the
new
psychology
went
further
and
seemed
convinced
that
it
had
actually
split
personality
not
only
into
dualism
but
also
into
complex
groups
like
telephonic
centres
and
systems
that
might
be
isolated
and
called
up
at
will
and
whose
physical
action
might
be
occult
in
the
sense
of
strangeness
to
any
known
form
of
force
dualism
seemed
to
have
become
as
common
as
binary
stars
alternating
personalities
turned
up
constantly
even
among
one
friends
the
facts
seemed
certain
or
at
least
as
certain
as
other
facts
all
they
needed
was
explanation
this
was
not
the
business
of
the
searcher
of
ignorance
who
felt
himself
in
no
way
responsible
for
causes
to
his
mind
the
compound
ivxn
took
at
once
the
form
of
a
mechanically
balancing
himself
by
inhibiting
all
his
inferior
personalities
and
sure
to
fall
into
the
chaos
below
if
one
of
his
inferior
personalities
got
on
top
the
only
absolute
truth
was
the
chaos
below
which
every
one
could
feel
when
he
sought
it
whether
the
psychologists
admitted
it
or
not
mattered
little
to
the
student
who
by
the
law
of
his
profession
was
engaged
in
studying
his
own
mind
on
him
the
effect
was
surprising
he
woke
up
with
a
shudder
as
though
he
had
himself
fallen
off
his
bicycle
if
his
mind
were
really
this
sort
of
magnet
mechanically
dispersing
its
lines
of
force
when
it
went
to
sleep
and
mechanically
orienting
them
when
it
woke
up
which
was
normal
the
dispersion
or
orientation
the
mind
like
the
body
kept
its
unity
unless
it
happened
to
lose
balance
but
the
professor
of
physics
who
slipped
on
a
pavement
and
hurt
himself
knew
no
more
than
an
idiot
what
knocked
him
down
though
he
did
know
what
the
idiot
could
hardly
do
that
his
normal
condition
was
idiocy
or
want
of
balance
and
that
his
sanity
was
unstable
artifice
his
normal
thought
was
dispersion
sleep
dream
inconsequence
the
simultaneous
action
of
different
without
central
control
his
artificial
balance
was
acquired
habit
he
was
an
acrobat
with
a
dwarf
on
his
back
crossing
a
chasm
on
a
and
commonly
breaking
his
neck
by
that
path
of
newest
science
one
saw
no
unity
ahead
nothing
but
a
dissolving
mind
and
the
historian
felt
himself
driven
back
on
thought
as
one
continuous
force
without
race
sex
school
country
or
church
this
has
been
always
the
fate
of
rigorous
thinkers
and
has
always
succeeded
in
making
them
famous
as
it
did
gibbon
buckle
and
auguste
comte
their
method
made
what
progress
the
science
of
history
knew
which
was
little
enough
but
they
did
at
last
fix
the
law
that
if
history
ever
meant
to
correct
the
errors
she
made
in
detail
she
must
agree
on
a
scale
for
the
whole
every
local
historian
might
defy
this
law
till
history
ended
but
its
necessity
would
be
the
same
for
man
as
for
space
or
time
or
force
and
without
it
the
historian
would
always
remain
a
child
in
science
any
schoolboy
could
see
that
man
as
a
force
must
be
measured
by
motion
from
a
fixed
point
psychology
helped
here
by
suggesting
a
unit
the
point
of
history
when
man
held
the
highest
idea
of
himself
as
a
unit
in
a
unified
universe
eight
or
ten
years
of
study
had
led
adams
to
think
he
might
use
the
century
expressed
in
amiens
cathedral
and
the
works
of
thomas
aquinas
as
the
unit
from
which
he
might
measure
motion
down
to
his
own
time
without
assuming
anything
as
true
or
untrue
except
relation
the
movement
might
be
studied
at
once
in
philosophy
and
mechanics
setting
himself
to
the
task
he
began
a
volume
which
he
mentally
knew
as
and
chartres
a
study
of
unity
from
that
point
he
proposed
to
fix
a
position
for
himself
which
he
could
label
the
education
of
henry
adams
a
study
of
multiplicity
with
the
help
of
these
two
points
of
relation
he
hoped
to
project
his
lines
forward
and
backward
indefinitely
subject
to
correction
from
any
one
who
should
know
better
thereupon
he
sailed

vis
inertiae
washington
was
always
amusing
but
in
as
in
its
chief
interest
lay
in
its
distance
from
new
york
the
movement
of
new
york
had
become
planetary
beyond
control
while
the
task
of
washington
in
as
in
was
to
control
it
the
success
of
washington
in
the
past
century
promised
ill
for
its
success
in
the
next
to
a
student
who
had
passed
the
best
years
of
his
life
in
pondering
over
the
political
philosophy
of
jefferson
gallatin
and
madison
the
problem
that
roosevelt
took
in
hand
seemed
alive
with
historical
interest
but
it
would
need
at
least
another
to
show
its
results
as
yet
one
could
not
measure
the
forces
or
their
arrangement
the
forces
had
not
even
aligned
themselves
except
in
foreign
affairs
and
there
one
turned
to
seek
the
channel
of
wisdom
as
naturally
as
though
washington
did
not
exist
the
president
could
do
nothing
effectual
in
foreign
affairs
but
at
least
he
could
see
something
of
the
field
hay
had
reached
the
summit
of
his
career
and
saw
himself
on
the
edge
of
wreck
committed
to
the
task
of
keeping
china
open
he
saw
china
about
to
be
shut
almost
alone
in
the
world
he
represented
the
open
door
and
could
not
escape
being
crushed
by
it
yet
luck
had
been
with
him
in
full
tide
though
sir
julian
pauncefote
had
died
in
may
after
carrying
out
tasks
that
filled
an
secretary
of
with
astonishment
hay
had
been
helped
by
the
appointment
of
michael
herbert
as
his
successor
who
counted
for
double
the
value
of
an
ordinary
diplomat
to
reduce
friction
is
the
chief
use
of
friendship
and
in
politics
the
loss
by
friction
is
outrageous
to
herbert
and
his
wife
the
small
knot
of
houses
that
seemed
to
give
a
vague
unity
to
foreign
affairs
opened
their
doors
and
their
hearts
for
the
herberts
were
already
at
home
there
and
this
personal
sympathy
prolonged
hay
life
for
it
not
only
eased
the
effort
of
endurance
but
it
also
led
directly
to
a
revolution
in
germany
down
to
that
moment
the
kaiser
rightly
or
wrongly
had
counted
as
the
ally
of
the
czar
in
all
matters
relating
to
the
east
holleben
and
cassini
were
taken
to
be
a
single
force
in
eastern
affairs
and
this
supposed
alliance
gave
hay
no
little
anxiety
and
some
trouble
suddenly
holleben
who
seemed
to
have
had
no
thought
but
to
obey
with
almost
agonized
anxiety
the
least
hint
of
the
kaiser
will
received
a
telegram
ordering
him
to
pretext
illness
and
come
home
which
he
obeyed
within
hours
the
ways
of
the
german
foreign
office
had
been
always
abrupt
not
to
say
ruthless
towards
its
agents
and
yet
commonly
some
discontent
had
been
shown
as
excuse
but
in
this
case
no
cause
was
guessed
for
holleben
disgrace
except
the
kaiser
wish
to
have
a
personal
representative
at
washington
breaking
down
all
precedent
he
sent
speck
von
sternburg
to
counterbalance
herbert
welcome
as
speck
was
in
the
same
social
intimacy
and
valuable
as
his
presence
was
to
hay
the
personal
gain
was
trifling
compared
with
the
political
of
hay
official
tasks
one
knew
no
more
than
any
newspaper
reporter
did
but
of
one
own
diplomatic
education
the
successive
steps
had
become
strides
the
scholar
was
studying
not
on
hay
account
but
on
his
own
he
had
seen
hay
in
bring
england
into
his
combine
he
had
seen
the
steady
movement
which
was
to
bring
france
back
into
an
atlantic
system
and
now
he
saw
suddenly
the
dramatic
swing
of
germany
towards
the
west
the
movement
of
all
others
nearest
mathematical
certainty
whether
the
kaiser
meant
it
or
not
he
gave
the
effect
of
meaning
to
assert
his
independence
of
russia
and
to
hay
this
change
of
front
had
enormous
value
the
least
was
that
it
seemed
to
isolate
cassini
and
unmask
the
russian
movement
which
became
more
threatening
every
month
as
the
manchurian
scheme
had
to
be
revealed
of
course
the
student
saw
whole
continents
of
study
opened
to
him
by
the
kaiser
coup
carefully
as
he
had
tried
to
follow
the
kaiser
career
he
had
never
suspected
such
refinement
of
policy
which
raised
his
opinion
of
the
kaiser
ability
to
the
highest
point
and
altogether
upset
the
centre
of
statesmanship
that
germany
could
be
so
quickly
detached
from
separate
objects
and
brought
into
an
atlantic
system
seemed
a
paradox
more
paradoxical
than
any
that
one
education
had
yet
offered
though
it
had
offered
little
but
paradox
if
germany
could
be
held
there
a
century
of
friction
would
be
saved
no
price
would
be
too
great
for
such
an
object
although
no
price
could
probably
be
wrung
out
of
congress
as
equivalent
for
it
the
kaiser
by
one
personal
act
of
energy
freed
hay
hands
so
completely
that
he
saw
his
problems
simplified
to
russia
alone
naturally
russia
was
a
problem
ten
times
as
difficult
the
history
of
europe
for
two
hundred
years
had
accomplished
little
but
to
state
one
or
two
sides
of
the
russian
problem
one
year
of
berlin
in
youth
though
it
taught
no
civil
law
had
opened
one
eyes
to
the
russian
enigma
and
both
german
and
french
historians
had
labored
over
its
proportions
with
a
sort
of
fascinated
horror
germany
of
all
countries
was
most
vitally
concerned
in
it
but
even
a
in
la
fayette
square
seeking
only
a
measure
of
motion
since
the
crusades
saw
before
his
eyes
in
the
spring
of
a
survey
of
future
order
or
anarchy
that
would
exhaust
the
power
of
his
telescopes
and
defy
the
accuracy
of
his
theodolites
the
drama
had
become
passionately
interesting
and
grew
every
day
more
byzantine
for
the
russian
government
itself
showed
clear
signs
of
dislocation
and
the
orders
of
lamsdorf
and
de
witte
were
reversed
when
applied
in
manchuria
historians
and
students
should
have
no
sympathies
or
antipathies
but
adams
had
private
reasons
for
wishing
well
to
the
czar
and
his
people
at
much
length
in
several
labored
chapters
of
history
he
had
told
how
the
personal
friendliness
of
the
czar
alexander
i
in
saved
the
fortunes
of
adams
and
opened
to
him
the
brilliant
diplomatic
career
that
ended
in
the
white
house
even
in
his
own
effaced
existence
he
had
reasons
not
altogether
trivial
for
gratitude
to
the
czar
alexander
ii
whose
firm
neutrality
had
saved
him
some
terribly
anxious
days
and
nights
in
while
he
had
seen
enough
of
russia
to
sympathize
warmly
with
prince
railways
and
de
witte
industries
the
last
and
highest
triumph
of
history
would
to
his
mind
be
the
bringing
of
russia
into
the
atlantic
combine
and
the
just
and
fair
allotment
of
the
whole
world
among
the
regulated
activities
of
the
universe
at
the
rate
of
unification
since
this
end
should
be
possible
within
another
sixty
years
and
in
foresight
of
that
point
adams
could
already
finish
provisionally
his
chart
of
international
unity
but
for
the
moment
the
gravest
doubts
and
ignorance
covered
the
whole
field
no
one
czar
or
diplomat
kaiser
or
mikado
seemed
to
know
anything
through
individual
russians
one
could
always
see
with
ease
for
their
diplomacy
never
suggested
depth
and
perhaps
hay
protected
cassini
for
the
very
reason
that
cassini
could
not
disguise
an
emotion
and
never
failed
to
betray
that
in
setting
the
enormous
bulk
of
russian
inertia
to
roll
over
china
he
regretted
infinitely
that
he
should
have
to
roll
it
over
hay
too
he
would
almost
rather
have
rolled
it
over
de
witte
and
lamsdorf
his
political
philosophy
like
that
of
all
russians
seemed
fixed
in
the
single
idea
that
russia
must
fatally
roll
must
by
her
irresistible
inertia
crush
whatever
stood
in
her
way
for
hay
and
his
pooling
policy
inherited
from
mckinley
the
fatalism
of
russian
inertia
meant
the
failure
of
american
intensity
when
russia
rolled
over
a
neighboring
people
she
absorbed
their
energies
in
her
own
movement
of
custom
and
race
which
neither
czar
nor
peasant
could
convert
or
wished
to
convert
into
any
western
equivalent
in
hay
saw
russia
knocking
away
the
last
blocks
that
held
back
the
launch
of
this
huge
mass
into
the
china
sea
the
vast
force
of
inertia
known
as
china
was
to
be
united
with
the
huge
bulk
of
russia
in
a
single
mass
which
no
amount
of
new
force
could
henceforward
deflect
had
the
russian
government
with
the
sharpest
sense
of
enlightenment
employed
scores
of
de
wittes
and
khilkoffs
and
borrowed
all
the
resources
of
europe
it
could
not
have
lifted
such
a
weight
and
had
no
idea
of
trying
these
were
the
positions
charted
on
the
map
of
political
unity
by
an
insect
in
washington
in
the
spring
of
and
they
seemed
to
him
fixed
russia
held
europe
and
america
in
her
grasp
and
cassini
held
hay
in
his
the
siberian
railway
offered
checkmate
to
all
possible
opposition
japan
must
make
the
best
terms
she
could
england
must
go
on
receding
america
and
germany
would
look
on
at
the
avalanche
the
wall
of
russian
inertia
that
barred
europe
across
the
baltic
would
bar
america
across
the
pacific
and
hay
policy
of
the
open
door
would
infallibly
fail
thus
the
game
seemed
lost
in
spite
of
the
kaiser
brilliant
stroke
and
the
movement
of
russia
eastward
must
drag
germany
after
it
by
its
mere
mass
to
the
humble
student
the
loss
of
hay
game
affected
only
hay
for
himself
the
game
not
the
stakes
was
the
chief
interest
and
though
want
of
habit
made
him
object
to
read
his
newspapers
blackened
since
he
liked
to
blacken
them
himself
he
was
in
any
case
condemned
to
pass
but
a
short
space
of
time
either
in
siberia
or
in
paris
and
could
balance
his
endless
columns
of
calculation
equally
in
either
place
the
figures
not
the
facts
concerned
his
chart
and
he
mused
deeply
over
his
next
equation
the
atlantic
would
have
to
deal
with
a
vast
continental
mass
of
inert
motion
like
a
glacier
which
moved
and
consciously
moved
by
mechanical
gravitation
alone
russia
saw
herself
so
and
so
must
an
american
see
her
he
had
no
more
to
do
than
measure
if
he
could
the
mass
was
volume
or
intensity
the
stronger
what
and
where
was
the
vis
nova
that
could
hold
its
own
before
this
prodigious
of
vis
inertiae
what
was
movement
of
inertia
and
what
its
laws
naturally
a
student
knew
nothing
about
mechanical
laws
but
he
took
for
granted
that
he
could
learn
and
went
to
his
books
to
ask
he
found
that
the
force
of
inertia
had
troubled
wiser
men
than
he
the
dictionary
said
that
inertia
was
a
property
of
matter
by
which
matter
tends
when
at
rest
to
remain
so
and
when
in
motion
to
move
on
in
a
straight
line
finding
that
his
mind
refused
to
imagine
itself
at
rest
or
in
a
straight
line
he
was
forced
as
usual
to
let
it
imagine
something
else
and
since
the
question
concerned
the
mind
and
not
matter
he
decided
from
personal
experience
that
his
mind
was
never
at
rest
but
moved
when
normal
about
something
it
called
a
motive
and
never
moved
without
motives
to
move
it
so
long
as
these
motives
were
habitual
and
their
attraction
regular
the
consequent
result
might
for
convenience
be
called
movement
of
inertia
to
distinguish
it
from
movement
caused
by
newer
or
higher
attraction
but
the
greater
the
bulk
to
move
the
greater
must
be
the
force
to
accelerate
or
deflect
it
this
seemed
simple
as
running
water
but
simplicity
is
the
most
deceitful
mistress
that
ever
betrayed
man
for
years
the
student
and
the
professor
had
gone
on
complaining
that
minds
were
unequally
inert
the
inequalities
amounted
to
contrasts
one
class
of
minds
responded
only
to
habit
another
only
to
novelty
race
classified
thought
classified
mind
no
two
men
thought
alike
and
no
woman
thought
like
a
man
seemed
to
be
fairly
constant
and
made
the
chief
trouble
in
the
russian
future
history
looked
doubtful
when
asked
whether
had
ever
been
overcome
without
destroying
the
race
in
order
to
reconstruct
it
but
surely
had
never
been
overcome
at
all
of
all
movements
of
inertia
maternity
and
reproduction
are
the
most
typical
and
women
property
of
moving
in
a
constant
line
forever
is
ultimate
uniting
history
in
its
only
unbroken
and
unbreakable
sequence
whatever
else
stops
the
woman
must
go
on
reproducing
as
she
did
in
the
siluria
of
pteraspis
sex
is
a
vital
condition
and
race
only
a
local
one
if
the
laws
of
inertia
are
to
be
sought
anywhere
with
certainty
it
is
in
the
feminine
mind
the
american
always
ostentatiously
ignored
sex
and
american
history
mentioned
hardly
the
name
of
a
woman
while
english
history
handled
them
as
timidly
as
though
they
were
a
new
and
undescribed
species
but
if
the
problem
of
inertia
summed
up
the
difficulties
of
the
race
question
it
involved
that
of
sex
far
more
deeply
and
to
americans
vitally
the
task
of
accelerating
or
deflecting
the
movement
of
the
american
woman
had
interest
infinitely
greater
than
that
of
any
race
whatever
russian
or
chinese
asiatic
or
african
on
this
subject
as
on
the
senate
and
the
banks
adams
was
conscious
of
having
been
born
an
remainder
as
he
grew
older
he
found
that
early
institutions
lost
their
interest
but
that
early
women
became
a
passion
without
understanding
movement
of
sex
history
seemed
to
him
mere
pedantry
so
insistent
had
he
become
on
this
side
of
his
subject
that
with
women
he
talked
of
little
else
and
because
women
thought
is
mostly
subconscious
and
particularly
sensitive
to
suggestion
he
tried
tricks
and
devices
to
disclose
it
the
woman
seldom
knows
her
own
thought
she
is
as
curious
to
understand
herself
as
the
man
to
understand
her
and
responds
far
more
quickly
than
the
man
to
a
sudden
idea
sometimes
at
dinner
one
might
wait
till
talk
flagged
and
then
as
mildly
as
possible
ask
one
liveliest
neighbor
whether
she
could
explain
why
the
american
woman
was
a
failure
without
an
instant
hesitation
she
was
sure
to
answer
because
the
american
man
is
a
failure
she
meant
it
adams
owed
more
to
the
american
woman
than
to
all
the
american
men
he
ever
heard
of
and
felt
not
the
smallest
call
to
defend
his
sex
who
seemed
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
sex
he
felt
much
curiosity
to
know
how
far
the
woman
was
right
and
in
pursuing
this
inquiry
he
caught
the
trick
of
affirming
that
the
woman
was
the
superior
apart
from
truth
he
owed
her
at
least
that
compliment
the
habit
led
sometimes
to
perilous
personalities
in
the
sudden
of
this
spring
just
before
sailing
for
europe
in
may
he
had
a
message
from
his
brooks
adams
to
say
that
she
and
her
sister
lodge
and
the
senator
were
coming
to
dinner
by
way
of
farewell
bay
lodge
and
his
lovely
young
wife
sent
word
to
the
same
effect
roosevelt
joined
the
party
and
michael
herbert
shyly
slipped
down
to
escape
the
solitude
of
his
wife
absence
the
party
were
too
intimate
for
reserve
and
they
soon
fell
on
adams
hobby
with
derision
which
stung
him
to
pungent
rejoinder
the
american
man
is
a
failure
you
are
all
failures
he
said
has
not
my
sister
here
more
sense
than
my
brother
brooks
is
not
bessie
worth
two
of
bay
would
we
all
elect
lodge
senator
against
cabot
would
the
president
have
a
ghost
of
a
chance
if
roosevelt
ran
against
him
do
you
want
to
stop
at
the
embassy
on
your
way
home
and
ask
which
would
run
it
best
herbert
or
his
wife
the
men
laughed
a
little
not
much
each
probably
made
allowance
for
his
own
wife
as
an
unusually
superior
woman
some
one
afterwards
remarked
that
these
women
were
not
a
fair
average
adams
replied
that
the
men
were
above
all
possible
average
he
could
not
lay
his
hands
on
another
their
equals
gay
or
serious
the
question
never
failed
to
stir
feeling
the
cleverer
the
woman
the
less
she
denied
the
failure
she
was
bitter
at
heart
about
it
she
had
failed
even
to
hold
the
family
together
and
her
children
ran
away
like
chickens
with
their
first
feathers
the
family
was
extinct
like
chivalry
she
had
failed
not
only
to
create
a
new
society
that
satisfied
her
but
even
to
hold
her
own
in
the
old
society
of
church
or
state
and
was
left
for
the
most
part
with
no
place
but
the
theatre
or
streets
to
decorate
she
might
glitter
with
historical
diamonds
and
sparkle
with
wit
as
brilliant
as
the
gems
in
rooms
as
splendid
as
any
in
rome
at
its
best
but
she
saw
no
one
except
her
own
sex
who
knew
enough
to
be
worth
dazzling
or
was
competent
to
pay
her
intelligent
homage
she
might
have
her
own
way
without
restraint
or
limit
but
she
knew
not
what
to
do
with
herself
when
free
never
had
the
world
known
a
more
capable
or
devoted
mother
but
at
forty
her
task
was
over
and
she
was
left
with
no
stage
except
that
of
her
old
duties
or
of
washington
society
where
she
had
enjoyed
for
a
hundred
years
every
advantage
but
had
created
only
a
medley
where
nine
men
out
of
ten
refused
her
request
to
be
civilized
and
the
tenth
bored
her
on
most
subjects
one
opinions
must
defer
to
science
but
on
this
the
opinion
of
a
senator
or
a
professor
a
chairman
of
a
state
central
committee
or
a
railway
president
is
worth
less
than
that
of
any
woman
on
fifth
avenue
the
inferiority
of
man
on
this
the
most
important
of
all
social
subjects
is
manifest
adams
had
here
no
occasion
to
deprecate
scientific
opinion
since
no
woman
in
the
world
would
have
paid
the
smallest
respect
to
the
opinions
of
all
professors
since
the
serpent
his
own
object
had
little
to
do
with
theirs
he
was
studying
the
laws
of
motion
and
had
struck
two
large
questions
of
vital
importance
to
america
inertia
of
race
and
inertia
of
sex
he
had
seen
de
witte
and
prince
khilkoff
turn
artificial
energy
to
the
value
of
three
thousand
million
dollars
more
or
less
upon
russian
inertia
in
the
last
twenty
years
and
he
needed
to
get
some
idea
of
the
effects
he
had
seen
artificial
energy
to
the
amount
of
twenty
or
million
steam
created
in
america
since
and
as
much
more
economized
which
had
been
socially
turned
over
to
the
american
woman
she
being
the
chief
object
of
social
expenditure
and
the
household
the
only
considerable
object
of
american
extravagance
according
to
scientific
notions
of
inertia
and
force
what
ought
to
be
the
result
in
russia
because
of
race
and
bulk
no
result
had
yet
shown
itself
but
in
america
the
results
were
evident
and
undisputed
the
woman
had
been
set
free
volatilized
like
clerk
maxwell
perfect
gas
almost
brought
to
the
point
of
explosion
like
steam
one
had
but
to
pass
a
week
in
florida
or
on
any
of
a
hundred
huge
ocean
steamers
or
walk
through
the
place
vendome
or
join
a
party
of
cook
tourists
to
jerusalem
to
see
that
the
woman
had
been
set
free
but
these
swarms
were
ephemeral
like
clouds
of
butterflies
in
season
blown
away
and
lost
while
the
reproductive
sources
lay
hidden
at
washington
one
saw
other
swarms
as
grave
gatherings
of
dames
or
daughters
taking
themselves
seriously
or
brides
fluttering
fresh
pinions
but
all
these
shifting
visions
unknown
before
touched
the
true
problem
slightly
and
superficially
behind
them
in
every
city
town
and
farmhouse
were
myriads
of
new
types
or
telephone
and
running
into
millions
of
millions
and
as
classes
unknown
to
themselves
as
to
historians
even
the
schoolmistresses
were
inarticulate
all
these
new
women
had
been
created
since
all
were
to
show
their
meaning
before
whatever
they
were
they
were
not
content
as
the
ephemera
proved
and
they
were
hungry
for
illusions
as
ever
in
the
fourth
century
of
the
church
but
this
was
probably
survival
and
gave
no
hint
of
the
future
the
problem
remained
to
find
out
whether
movement
of
inertia
inherent
in
function
could
take
direction
except
in
lines
of
inertia
this
problem
needed
to
be
solved
in
one
generation
of
american
women
and
was
the
most
vital
of
all
problems
of
force
the
american
woman
at
her
best
like
most
other
women
exerted
great
charm
on
the
man
but
not
the
charm
of
a
primitive
type
she
appeared
as
the
result
of
a
long
series
of
discards
and
her
chief
interest
lay
in
what
she
had
discarded
when
closely
watched
she
seemed
making
a
violent
effort
to
follow
the
man
who
had
turned
his
mind
and
hand
to
mechanics
the
typical
american
man
had
his
hand
on
a
lever
and
his
eye
on
a
curve
in
his
road
his
living
depended
on
keeping
up
an
average
speed
of
forty
miles
an
hour
tending
always
to
become
sixty
eighty
or
a
hundred
and
he
could
not
admit
emotions
or
anxieties
or
subconscious
distractions
more
than
he
could
admit
whiskey
or
drugs
without
breaking
his
neck
he
could
not
run
his
machine
and
a
woman
too
he
must
leave
her
even
though
his
wife
to
find
her
own
way
and
all
the
world
saw
her
trying
to
find
her
way
by
imitating
him
the
result
was
often
tragic
but
that
was
no
new
thing
in
feminine
history
tragedy
had
been
woman
lot
since
eve
her
problem
had
been
always
one
of
physical
strength
and
it
was
as
physical
perfection
of
force
that
her
venus
had
governed
nature
the
force
had
counted
as
inertia
of
rotation
and
her
axis
of
rotation
had
been
the
cradle
and
the
family
the
idea
that
she
was
weak
revolted
all
history
it
was
a
palaeontological
falsehood
that
even
an
eocene
female
monkey
would
have
laughed
at
but
it
was
surely
true
that
if
her
force
were
to
be
diverted
from
its
axis
it
must
find
a
new
field
and
the
family
must
pay
for
it
so
far
as
she
succeeded
she
must
become
sexless
like
the
bees
and
must
leave
the
old
energy
of
inertia
to
carry
on
the
race
the
story
was
not
new
for
thousands
of
years
women
had
rebelled
they
had
made
a
fortress
of
religion
had
buried
themselves
in
the
cloister
in
in
good
works
or
even
in
bad
one
studies
in
the
twelfth
century
like
one
studies
in
the
fourth
as
in
homeric
and
archaic
time
showed
her
always
busy
in
the
illusions
of
heaven
or
of
hell
ambition
intrigue
jealousy
magic
but
the
american
woman
had
no
illusions
or
ambitions
or
new
resources
and
nothing
to
rebel
against
except
her
own
maternity
yet
the
rebels
increased
by
millions
from
year
to
year
till
they
blocked
the
path
of
rebellion
even
her
field
of
good
works
was
narrower
than
in
the
twelfth
century
socialism
communism
collectivism
philosophical
anarchism
which
promised
paradise
on
earth
for
every
male
cut
off
the
few
avenues
of
escape
which
capitalism
had
opened
to
the
woman
and
she
saw
before
her
only
the
future
reserved
for
collectivist
females
from
the
male
she
could
look
for
no
help
his
instinct
of
power
was
blind
the
church
had
known
more
about
women
than
science
will
ever
know
and
the
historian
who
studied
the
sources
of
christianity
felt
sometimes
convinced
that
the
church
had
been
made
by
the
woman
chiefly
as
her
protest
against
man
at
times
the
historian
would
have
been
almost
willing
to
maintain
that
the
man
had
overthrown
the
church
chiefly
because
it
was
feminine
after
the
overthrow
of
the
church
the
woman
had
no
refuge
except
such
as
the
man
created
for
himself
she
was
free
she
had
no
illusions
she
was
sexless
she
had
discarded
all
that
the
male
disliked
and
although
she
secretly
regretted
the
discard
she
knew
that
she
could
not
go
backward
she
must
like
the
man
marry
machinery
already
the
american
man
sometimes
felt
surprise
at
finding
himself
regarded
as
sexless
the
american
woman
was
oftener
surprised
at
finding
herself
regarded
as
sexual
no
honest
historian
can
take
part
with
or
against
the
forces
he
has
to
study
to
him
even
the
extinction
of
the
human
race
should
be
merely
a
fact
to
be
grouped
with
other
vital
statistics
no
doubt
every
one
in
society
discussed
the
subject
impelled
by
president
roosevelt
if
by
nothing
else
and
the
surface
current
of
social
opinion
seemed
set
as
strongly
in
one
direction
as
the
silent
undercurrent
of
social
action
ran
in
the
other
but
the
truth
lay
somewhere
unconscious
in
the
woman
breast
an
elderly
man
trying
only
to
learn
the
law
of
social
inertia
and
the
limits
of
social
divergence
could
not
compel
the
superintendent
of
the
census
to
ask
every
young
woman
whether
she
wanted
children
and
how
many
he
could
not
even
require
of
an
octogenarian
senate
the
passage
of
a
law
obliging
every
woman
married
or
not
to
bear
one
baby
at
the
expense
of
the
treasury
before
she
was
thirty
years
old
under
penalty
of
solitary
confinement
for
life
yet
these
were
vital
statistics
in
more
senses
than
all
that
bore
the
name
and
tended
more
directly
to
the
foundation
of
a
serious
society
in
the
future
he
could
draw
no
conclusions
whatever
except
from
the
he
could
not
frankly
discuss
the
matter
with
the
young
women
themselves
although
they
would
have
gladly
discussed
it
because
faust
was
helpless
in
the
tragedy
of
woman
he
could
suggest
nothing
the
marguerite
of
the
future
could
alone
decide
whether
she
were
better
off
than
the
marguerite
of
the
past
whether
she
would
rather
be
victim
to
a
man
a
church
or
a
machine
between
these
various
forms
of
inevitable
inertia
sex
and
race
the
student
of
multiplicity
felt
inclined
to
admit
that
ignorance
against
ignorance
the
russian
problem
seemed
to
him
somewhat
easier
of
treatment
than
the
american
inertia
of
race
and
bulk
would
require
an
immense
force
to
overcome
it
but
in
time
it
might
perhaps
be
partially
overcome
inertia
of
sex
could
not
be
overcome
without
extinguishing
the
race
yet
an
immense
force
doubling
every
few
years
was
working
irresistibly
to
overcome
it
one
gazed
mute
before
this
ocean
of
darkest
ignorance
that
had
already
engulfed
society
few
centres
of
great
energy
lived
in
illusion
more
complete
or
archaic
than
washington

its
standards
of
the
field
and

its
southern
and
western
habits
of
life
and
manners
its
assumptions
of
ethics
and
history
but
even
in
washington
society
was
uneasy
enough
to
need
no
further
fretting
one

almost
glad
to
act
the
part
of
horseshoe
crab
in
quincy
bay
and
admit
that
all
was
uniform
that
nothing
ever
changed

that
the

would
swim
about

try
to
find
out
what
karl
pearson
could
have
taught
willard
gibbs
here
came
in
more
than
ever
the
fatal
handicap
of
ignorance
in
mathematics
not
so
much
the
actual
tool
was
needed
as
the
right
to
judge
the
product
of
the
tool
ignorant
as
one
was
of
the
finer
values
of
french
or
german
and
often
deceived
by
the
intricacies
of
thought
hidden
in
the
muddiness
of
the
medium
one
could
sometimes
catch
a
tendency
to
intelligible
meaning
even
in
kant
or
hegel
but
one
had
not
the
right
to
a
suspicion
of
error
where
the
tool
of
thought
was
algebra
adams
could
see
in
such
parts
of
the
grammar
as
he
could
understand
little
more
than
an
enlargement
of
stallo
book
already
twenty
years
old
he
never
found
out
what
it
could
have
taught
a
master
like
willard
gibbs
yet
the
book
had
a
historical
value
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
science
no
such
stride
had
any
englishman
before
taken
in
the
lines
of
english
thought
the
progress
of
science
was
measured
by
the
success
of
the
grammar
when
for
twenty
years
past
stallo
had
been
deliberately
ignored
under
the
usual
conspiracy
of
silence
inevitable
to
all
thought
which
demands
new
science
needs
time
to
reconstruct
its
instruments
to
follow
a
revolution
in
space
a
certain
lag
is
inevitable
the
most
active
mind
can
not
instantly
swerve
from
its
path
but
such
revolutions
are
portentous
and
the
fall
or
rise
of
empires
interested
a
student
of
history
less
than
the
rise
of
the
grammar
of
science
the
more
pressingly
because
under
the
silent
influence
of
langley
he
was
prepared
to
expect
it
for
a
number
of
years
langley
had
published
in
his
smithsonian
reports
the
revolutionary
papers
that
foretold
the
overthrow
of
dogma
and
among
the
first
was
the
famous
address
of
sir
william
crookes
on
psychical
research
followed
by
a
series
of
papers
on
roentgen
and
curie
which
had
steadily
driven
the
scientific
lawgivers
of
unity
into
the
open
but
karl
pearson
was
the
first
to
pen
them
up
for
slaughter
in
the
schools
the
phrase
is
not
stronger
than
that
with
which
the
grammar
of
science
challenged
the
fight
anything
more
hopelessly
illogical
than
the
statements
with
regard
to
force
and
matter
current
in
elementary
textbooks
of
science
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
opened
pearson
and
the
responsible
author
of
the
elementary
textbook
as
he
went
on
to
explain
was
lord
kelvin
himself
pearson
shut
out
of
science
everything
which
the
nineteenth
century
had
brought
into
it
he
told
his
scholars
that
they
must
put
up
with
a
fraction
of
the
universe
and
a
very
small
fraction
at
that
the
circle
reached
by
the
senses
where
sequence
could
be
taken
for
granted
much
as
the
fish
takes
for
granted
the
circle
of
light
which
he
generates
order
and
reason
beauty
and
benevolence
are
characteristics
and
conceptions
which
we
find
solely
associated
with
the
mind
of
man
the
assertion
as
a
broad
truth
left
one
mind
in
some
doubt
of
its
bearing
for
order
and
beauty
seemed
to
be
associated
also
in
the
mind
of
a
crystal
if
one
senses
were
to
be
admitted
as
judge
but
the
historian
had
no
interest
in
the
universal
truth
of
pearson
or
kelvin
or
newton
laws
he
sought
only
their
relative
drift
or
direction
and
pearson
went
on
to
say
that
these
conceptions
must
stop
into
the
chaos
beyond
we
can
not
scientifically
project
them
we
can
not
even
infer
them
in
the
chaos
behind
sensations
in
the
of
we
can
not
infer
necessity
order
or
routine
for
these
are
concepts
formed
by
the
mind
of
man
on
this
side
of
but
we
must
infer
chaos
briefly
chaos
is
all
that
science
can
logically
assert
of
the
supersensuous
the
kinetic
theory
of
gas
is
an
assertion
of
ultimate
chaos
in
plain
words
chaos
was
the
law
of
nature
order
was
the
dream
of
man
no
one
means
all
he
says
and
yet
very
few
say
all
they
mean
for
words
are
slippery
and
thought
is
viscous
but
since
bacon
and
newton
english
thought
had
gone
on
impatiently
protesting
that
no
one
must
try
to
know
the
unknowable
at
the
same
time
that
every
one
went
on
thinking
about
it
the
result
was
as
chaotic
as
kinetic
gas
but
with
the
thought
a
historian
had
nothing
to
do
he
sought
only
its
direction
for
himself
he
knew
that
in
spite
of
all
the
englishmen
that
ever
lived
he
would
be
forced
to
enter
supersensual
chaos
if
he
meant
to
find
out
what
became
of
british
science
or
indeed
of
any
other
science
from
pythagoras
to
herbert
spencer
every
one
had
done
it
although
commonly
science
had
explored
an
ocean
which
it
preferred
to
regard
as
unity
or
a
universe
and
called
order
even
hegel
who
taught
that
every
notion
included
its
own
negation
used
the
negation
only
to
reach
a
larger
synthesis
till
he
reached
the
universal
which
thinks
itself
contradiction
and
all
the
church
alone
had
constantly
protested
that
anarchy
was
not
order
that
satan
was
not
god
that
pantheism
was
worse
than
atheism
and
that
unity
could
not
be
proved
as
a
contradiction
karl
pearson
seemed
to
agree
with
the
church
but
every
one
else
including
newton
darwin
and
clerk
maxwell
had
sailed
gaily
into
the
supersensual
calling
it
one
god
one
law
one
element
and
one
divine
event
to
which
the
whole
creation
moves
suddenly
in
science
raised
its
head
and
denied
yet
perhaps
after
all
the
change
had
not
been
so
sudden
as
it
seemed
real
and
actual
it
certainly
was
and
every
newspaper
betrayed
it
but
sequence
could
scarcely
be
denied
by
one
who
had
watched
its
steady
approach
thinking
the
change
far
more
interesting
to
history
than
the
thought
when
he
reflected
about
it
he
recalled
that
the
flow
of
tide
had
shown
itself
at
least
twenty
years
before
that
it
had
become
marked
as
early
as
and
that
the
man
of
science
must
have
been
sleepy
indeed
who
did
not
jump
from
his
chair
like
a
scared
dog
when
in
mme
curie
threw
on
his
desk
the
metaphysical
bomb
she
called
radium
there
remained
no
hole
to
hide
in
even
metaphysics
swept
back
over
science
with
the
green
water
of
the
ocean
and
no
one
could
longer
hope
to
bar
out
the
unknowable
for
the
unknowable
was
known
the
fact
was
admitted
that
the
uniformitarians
of
one
youth
had
wound
about
their
universe
a
tangle
of
contradictions
meant
only
for
temporary
support
to
be
merged
in
larger
synthesis
and
had
waited
for
the
larger
synthesis
in
silence
and
in
vain
they
had
refused
to
hear
stallo
they
had
betrayed
little
interest
in
crookes
at
last
their
universe
had
been
wrecked
by
rays
and
karl
pearson
undertook
to
cut
the
wreck
loose
with
an
axe
leaving
science
adrift
on
a
sensual
raft
in
the
midst
of
a
supersensual
chaos
the
confusion
seemed
to
a
mere
passenger
worse
than
that
of
when
the
astronomers
upset
the
world
it
resembled
rather
the
convulsion
of
when
the
civitas
dei
cut
itself
loose
from
the
civitas
romae
and
the
cross
took
the
place
of
the
legions
but
the
historian
accepted
it
all
alike
he
knew
that
his
opinion
was
worthless
only
in
this
case
he
found
himself
on
the
raft
personally
and
economically
concerned
in
its
drift
english
thought
had
always
been
chaos
and
multiplicity
itself
in
which
the
new
step
of
karl
pearson
marked
only
a
consistent
progress
but
german
thought
had
affected
system
unity
and
abstract
truth
to
a
point
that
fretted
the
most
patient
foreigner
and
to
germany
the
voyager
in
strange
seas
of
thought
alone
might
resort
with
confident
hope
of
renewing
his
youth
turning
his
back
on
karl
pearson
and
england
he
plunged
into
germany
and
had
scarcely
crossed
the
rhine
when
he
fell
into
libraries
of
new
works
bearing
the
names
of
ostwald
ernst
mach
ernst
haeckel
and
others
less
familiar
among
whom
haeckel
was
easiest
to
approach
not
only
because
of
being
the
oldest
and
clearest
and
steadiest
spokesman
of
mechanical
convictions
but
also
because
in
he
had
published
a
vehement
renewal
of
his
faith
the
volume
contained
only
one
paragraph
that
concerned
a
historian
it
was
that
in
which
haeckel
sank
his
voice
almost
to
a
religious
whisper
in
avowing
with
evident
effort
that
the
proper
essence
of
substance
appeared
to
him
more
and
more
marvellous
and
enigmatic
as
he
penetrated
further
into
the
knowledge
of
its
attributes
matter
and
energy
and
as
he
learned
to
know
their
innumerable
phenomena
and
their
evolution
since
haeckel
seemed
to
have
begun
the
voyage
into
multiplicity
that
pearson
had
forbidden
to
englishmen
he
should
have
been
a
safe
pilot
to
the
point
at
least
of
a
proper
essence
of
substance
in
its
attributes
of
matter
and
energy
but
ernst
mach
seemed
to
go
yet
one
step
further
for
he
rejected
matter
altogether
and
admitted
but
two
processes
in
nature
change
of
place
and
interconversion
of
forms
matter
was
motion
motion
was
matter
the
thing
moved
a
student
of
history
had
no
need
to
understand
these
scientific
ideas
of
very
great
men
he
sought
only
the
relation
with
the
ideas
of
their
grandfathers
and
their
common
direction
towards
the
ideas
of
their
grandsons
he
had
long
ago
reached
with
hegel
the
limits
of
contradiction
and
ernst
mach
scarcely
added
a
shade
of
variety
to
the
identity
of
opposites
but
both
of
them
seemed
to
be
in
agreement
with
karl
pearson
on
the
facts
of
the
supersensual
universe
which
could
be
known
only
as
unknowable
with
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
the
traveller
turned
back
to
france
there
he
felt
safe
no
frenchman
except
rabelais
and
montaigne
had
ever
taught
anarchy
other
than
as
path
to
order
chaos
would
be
unity
in
paris
even
if
child
of
the
guillotine
to
make
this
assurance
mathematically
sure
the
highest
scientific
authority
in
france
was
a
great
mathematician
poincare
of
the
institut
who
published
in
a
small
volume
called
la
science
et
which
purported
to
be
relatively
readable
trusting
to
its
external
appearance
the
traveller
timidly
bought
it
and
greedily
devoured
it
without
understanding
a
single
consecutive
page
but
catching
here
and
there
a
period
that
startled
him
to
the
depths
of
his
ignorance
for
they
seemed
to
show
that
poincare
was
troubled
by
the
same
historical
landmarks
which
guided
or
deluded
adams
himself
in
science
we
are
led
said
poincare
to
act
as
though
a
simple
law
when
other
things
were
equal
must
be
more
probable
than
a
complicated
law
half
a
century
ago
one
frankly
confessed
it
and
proclaimed
that
nature
loves
simplicity
she
has
since
given
us
too
often
the
lie
this
tendency
is
no
longer
avowed
and
only
as
much
of
it
is
preserved
as
is
indispensable
so
that
science
shall
not
become
impossible
here
at
last
was
a
fixed
point
beyond
the
chance
of
confusion
with
history
and
mathematics
agreed
had
poincare
shown
anarchistic
tastes
his
evidence
would
have
weighed
less
heavily
but
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
authority
in
science
who
felt
what
a
historian
felt
so
strongly
the
need
of
unity
in
a
universe
considering
everything
we
have
made
some
approach
towards
unity
we
have
not
gone
as
fast
as
we
hoped
fifty
years
ago
we
have
not
always
taken
the
intended
road
but
definitely
we
have
gained
much
ground
this
was
the
most
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
progress
yet
offered
to
the
navigator
of
ignorance
but
suddenly
he
fell
on
another
view
which
seemed
to
him
quite
irreconcilable
with
the
first
doubtless
if
our
means
of
investigation
should
become
more
and
more
penetrating
we
should
discover
the
simple
under
the
complex
then
the
complex
under
the
simple
then
anew
the
simple
under
the
complex
and
so
on
without
ever
being
able
to
foresee
the
last
term
a
mathematical
paradise
of
endless
displacement
promised
eternal
bliss
to
the
mathematician
but
turned
the
historian
green
with
horror
made
miserable
by
the
thought
that
he
knew
no
mathematics
he
burned
to
ask
whether
poincare
knew
any
history
since
he
began
by
begging
the
historical
question
altogether
and
assuming
that
the
past
showed
alternating
phases
of
simple
and
complex
the
precise
point
that
adams
after
fifty
years
of
effort
found
himself
forced
to
surrender
and
then
going
on
to
assume
alternating
phases
for
the
future
which
for
the
weary
titan
of
unity
differed
in
nothing
essential
from
the
kinetic
theory
of
a
perfect
gas
since
monkeys
first
began
to
chatter
in
trees
neither
man
nor
beast
had
ever
denied
or
doubted
multiplicity
diversity
complexity
anarchy
chaos
always
and
everywhere
the
complex
had
been
true
and
the
contradiction
had
been
certain
thought
started
by
it
mathematics
itself
began
by
counting
one
two
three
then
imagining
their
continuity
which
poincare
was
still
exhausting
his
wits
to
explain
or
defend
and
this
was
his
explanation
in
short
the
mind
has
the
faculty
of
creating
symbols
and
it
is
thus
that
it
has
constructed
mathematical
continuity
which
is
only
a
particular
system
of
symbols
with
the
same
light
touch
more
destructive
in
its
artistic
measure
than
the
brutality
of
englishmen
or
germans
he
went
on
to
upset
relative
truth
itself
how
should
i
answer
the
question
whether
euclidian
geometry
is
true
it
has
no
sense
euclidian
geometry
is
and
will
remain
the
most
convenient
chaos
was
a
primary
fact
even
in
paris
especially
in
paris
as
it
was
in
the
book
of
genesis
but
every
thinking
being
in
paris
or
out
of
it
had
exhausted
thought
in
the
effort
to
prove
unity
continuity
purpose
order
law
truth
the
universe
god
after
having
begun
by
taking
it
for
granted
and
discovering
to
their
profound
dismay
that
some
minds
denied
it
the
direction
of
mind
as
a
single
force
of
nature
had
been
constant
since
history
began
its
own
unity
had
created
a
universe
the
essence
of
which
was
abstract
truth
the
absolute
god
to
thomas
aquinas
the
universe
was
still
a
person
to
spinoza
a
substance
to
kant
truth
was
the
essence
of
the
i
an
innate
conviction
a
categorical
imperative
to
poincare
it
was
a
convenience
and
to
karl
pearson
a
medium
of
exchange
the
historian
never
stopped
repeating
to
himself
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
that
he
was
a
mere
instrument
of
measure
a
barometer
pedometer
radiometer
and
that
his
whole
share
in
the
matter
was
restricted
to
the
measurement
of
as
marked
by
the
accepted
thinkers
he
took
their
facts
for
granted
he
knew
no
more
than
a
firefly
about
rays
or
about
race
or
sex
or
ennui
or
a
bar
of
music
or
a
pang
of
love
or
a
grain
of
musk
or
of
phosphorus
or
conscience
or
duty
or
the
force
of
euclidian
geometry
or
or
heat
or

or
osmosis
or
electrolysis
or
the
magnet
or
ether
or
vis
inertiae
or
gravitation
or
cohesion
or
elasticity
or
surface
tension
or
capillary
attraction
or
brownian
motion
or
of
some
scores
or
thousands
or
millions
of
chemical
attractions
repulsions
or
indifferences
which
were
busy
within
and
without
him
or
in
brief
of
force
itself
which
he
was
credibly
informed
bore
some
dozen
definitions
in
the
textbooks
mostly
contradictory
and
all
as
he
was
assured
beyond
his
intelligence
but
summed
up
in
the
dictum
of
the
last
and
highest
science
that
motion
seems
to
be
matter
and
matter
seems
to
be
motion
yet
we
are
probably
incapable
of
discovering
what
either
is
history
had
no
need
to
ask
what
either
might
be
all
it
needed
to
know
was
the
admission
of
ignorance
the
mere
fact
of
multiplicity
baffling
science
even
as
to
the
fact
science
disputed
but
radium
happened
to
radiate
something
that
seemed
to
explode
the
scientific
magazine
bringing
thought
for
the
time
to
a
standstill
though
in
the
line
of
in
history
radium
was
merely
the
next
position
familiar
and
inexplicable
since
zeno
and
his
arrow
continuous
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
discontinuous
at
each
successive
point
history
set
it
down
on
the
record
pricked
its
position
on
the
chart
and
waited
to
be
led
or

adams
tried
to
imagine
it
and
an
education
that
would
fit
it
he
found
himself
in
a
land
where
no
one
had
ever
penetrated
before
where
order
was
an
accidental
relation
obnoxious
to
nature
artificial
compulsion
imposed
on
motion
against
which
every
free
energy
of
the
universe
revolted
and
which
being
merely
occasional
resolved
itself
back
into
anarchy
at
last
he
could
not
deny
that
the
law
of
the
new
multiverse
explained
much
that
had
been
most
obscure
especially
the
persistently
fiendish
treatment
of
man
by
man
the
perpetual
effort
of
society
to
establish
law
and
the
perpetual
revolt
of
society
against
the
law
it
had
established
the
perpetual
building
up
of
authority
by
force
and
the
perpetual
appeal
to
force
to
overthrow
it
the
perpetual
symbolism
of
a
higher
law
and
the
perpetual
relapse
to
a
lower
one
the
perpetual
victory
of
the
principles
of
freedom
and
their
perpetual
conversion
into
principles
of
power
but
the
staggering
problem
was
the
outlook
ahead
into
the
despotism
of
artificial
order
which
nature
abhorred
the
physicists
had
a
phrase
for
it
unintelligible
to
the
vulgar
all
that
we
win
is
a
battle
lost
in
advance
with
the
irreversible
phenomena
in
the
background
of
nature
all
that
a
historian
won
was
a
vehement
wish
to
escape
he
saw
his
education
complete
and
was
sorry
he
ever
began
it
as
a
matter
of
taste
he
greatly
preferred
his
education
when
god
was
a
father
and
nature
a
mother
and
all
was
for
the
best
in
a
scientific
universe
he
repudiated
all
share
in
the
world
as
it
was
to
be
and
yet
he
could
not
detect
the
point
where
his
responsibility
began
or
ended
as
history
unveiled
itself
in
the
new
order
man
mind
had
behaved
like
a
young
pearl
oyster
secreting
its
universe
to
suit
its
conditions
until
it
had
built
up
a
shell
of
nacre
that
embodied
all
its
notions
of
the
perfect
man
knew
it
was
true
because
he
made
it
and
he
loved
it
for
the
same
reason
he
sacrificed
millions
of
lives
to
acquire
his
unity
but
he
achieved
it
and
justly
thought
it
a
work
of
art
the
woman
especially
did
great
things
creating
her
deities
on
a
higher
level
than
the
male
and
in
the
end
compelling
the
man
to
accept
the
virgin
as
guardian
of
the
man
god
the
man
part
in
his
universe
was
secondary
but
the
woman
was
at
home
there
and
sacrificed
herself
without
limit
to
make
it
habitable
when
man
permitted
it
as
sometimes
happened
for
brief
intervals
of
war
and
famine
but
she
could
not
provide
protection
against
forces
of
nature
she
did
not
think
of
her
universe
as
a
raft
to
which
the
limpets
stuck
for
life
in
the
surge
of
a
supersensual
chaos
she
conceived
herself
and
her
family
as
the
centre
and
flower
of
an
ordered
universe
which
she
knew
to
be
unity
because
she
had
made
it
after
the
image
of
her
own
fecundity
and
this
creation
of
hers
was
surrounded
by
beauties
and
perfections
which
she
knew
to
be
real
because
she
herself
had
imagined
them
even
the
masculine
philosopher
admired
and
loved
and
celebrated
her
triumph
and
the
greatest
of
them
sang
it
in
the
noblest
of
his

such
seemed
the
theory
of

to
be
imposed
by

on
the
generation
born
after
for
this
theory
adams
felt
himself
in
no
way
responsible
even
as
historian
he
had
made
it
his
duty
always
to
speak
with
respect
of
everything
that
had
ever
been
thought
respectable
except
an
occasional
statesman
but
he
had
submitted
to
force
all
his
life
and
he
meant
to
accept
it
for
the
future
as
for
the
past
all
his
efforts
had
been
turned
only
to
the
search
for
its
channel
he
never
invented
his
facts
they
were
furnished
him
by
the
only
authorities
he
could
find
as
for
himself
according
to
helmholz
ernst
mach
and
arthur
balfour
he
was
henceforth
to
be
a
conscious
ball
of
vibrating
motions
traversed
in
every
direction
by
infinite
lines
of
rotation
or
vibration
rolling
at
the
feet
of
the

at
chartres
or
of
poincare
in
an

a

did
not
distress
him
a
solitary
man

more
alone
in

fret
himself
little
about

he
should
have
learned
his
lesson
fifty
years
earlier
the
times
had
long
passed
when
a
student
could
stop
before
chaos
or
order
he
had
no
choice
but
to
march
with
his
world
nevertheless
he
could
not
pretend
that
his
mind
felt
flattered
by
this
scientific
outlook
every
fabulist
has
told
how
the
human
mind
has
always
struggled
like
a
frightened
bird
to
escape
the
chaos
which
caged
it
how
appearing
suddenly
and
inexplicably
out
of
some
unknown
and
unimaginable
void
passing
half
its
known
life
in
the
mental
chaos
of
sleep
victim
even
when
awake
to
its
own
to
disease
to
age
to
external
suggestion
to
nature
compulsion
doubting
its
sensations
and
in
the
last
resort
trusting
only
to
instruments
and
averages
after
sixty
or
seventy
years
of
growing
astonishment
the
mind
wakes
to
find
itself
looking
blankly
into
the
void
of
death
that
it
should
profess
itself
pleased
by
this
performance
was
all
that
the
highest
rules
of
good
breeding
could
ask
but
that
it
should
actually
be
satisfied
would
prove
that
it
existed
only
as
idiocy
satisfied
the
future
generation
could
scarcely
think
itself
for
even
when
the
mind
existed
in
a
universe
of
its
own
creation
it
had
never
been
quite
at
ease
as
far
as
one
ventured
to
interpret
actual
science
the
mind
had
thus
far
adjusted
itself
by
an
infinite
series
of
infinitely
delicate
adjustments
forced
on
it
by
the
infinite
motion
of
an
infinite
chaos
of
motion
dragged
at
one
moment
into
the
unknowable
and
unthinkable
then
trying
to
scramble
back
within
its
senses
and
to
bar
the
chaos
out
but
always
assimilating
bits
of
it
until
at
last
in
a
new
avalanche
of
unknown
forces
had
fallen
on
it
which
required
new
mental
powers
to
control
if
this
view
was
correct
the
mind
could
gain
nothing
by
flight
or
by
fight
it
must
merge
in
its
supersensual
multiverse
or
succumb
to
it

xxxii
vis
nova
paris
after
midsummer
is
a
place
where
only
the
industrious
poor
remain
unless
they
can
get
away
but
adams
knew
no
spot
where
history
would
be
better
off
and
the
calm
of
the
champs
elysees
was
so
deep
that
when
de
witte
was
promoted
to
a
powerless
dignity
no
one
whispered
that
the
promotion
was
disgrace
while
one
might
have
supposed
from
the
silence
that
the
viceroy
alexeieff
had
reoccupied
manchuria
as
a
fulfilment
of
for
once
the
conspiracy
of
silence
became
crime
never
had
so
modern
and
so
vital
a
riddle
been
put
before
western
society
but
society
shut
its
eyes
manchuria
knew
every
step
into
war
japan
had
completed
every
preparation
alexeieff
had
collected
his
army
and
fleet
at
port
arthur
mounting
his
siege
guns
and
laying
in
enormous
stores
ready
for
the
expected
attack
from
yokohama
to
irkutsk
the
whole
east
was
under
war
conditions
but
europe
knew
nothing
the
banks
would
allow
no
disturbance
the
press
said
not
a
word
and
even
the
embassies
were
silent
every
anarchist
in
europe
buzzed
excitement
and
began
to
collect
in
groups
but
the
hotel
ritz
was
calm
and
the
grand
dukes
who
swarmed
there
professed
to
know
directly
from
the
winter
palace
that
there
would
be
no
war
as
usual
adams
felt
as
ignorant
as
the
statesman
and
though
the
sense
was
familiar
for
once
he
could
see
that
the
ignorance
was
assumed
after
nearly
fifty
years
of
experience
he
could
not
understand
how
the
comedy
could
be
so
well
acted
even
as
late
as
november
diplomats
were
gravely
asking
every
for
his
opinion
and
avowed
none
of
their
own
except
what
was
directly
authorized
at
petersburg
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
he
found
himself
in
face
of
his
new
problem
the
workings
of
russian
inertia
and
he
could
conceive
no
way
of
forming
an
opinion
how
much
was
real
and
how
much
was
comedy
had
he
been
in
the
winter
palace
himself
at
times
he
doubted
whether
the
grand
dukes
or
the
czar
knew
but
old
diplomatic
training
forbade
him
to
admit
such
innocence
this
was
the
situation
at
christmas
when
he
left
paris
on
january
he
reached
washington
where
the
contrast
of
atmosphere
astonished
him
for
he
had
never
before
seen
his
country
think
as
a
no
doubt
japanese
diplomacy
had
much
to
do
with
this
alertness
but
the
immense
superiority
of
japanese
diplomacy
should
have
been
more
evident
in
europe
than
in
america
and
in
any
case
could
not
account
for
the
total
disappearance
of
russian
diplomacy
a
government
by
inertia
greatly
disconcerted
study
one
was
led
to
suspect
that
cassini
never
heard
from
his
government
and
that
lamsdorf
knew
nothing
of
his
own
department
yet
no
such
suspicion
could
be
admitted
cassini
resorted
to
transparent
blague
japan
seemed
infatuated
even
to
the
point
of
war
but
what
can
the
japanese
do
as
usual
sit
on
their
heels
and
pray
to
buddha
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
accomplished
diplomatists
in
the
service
could
never
show
his
hand
so
empty
as
this
if
he
held
a
card
to
play
but
he
never
betrayed
stronger
resource
behind
if
any
japanese
succeed
in
entering
manchuria
they
will
never
get
out
of
it
alive
the
inertia
of
cassini
who
was
naturally
the
most
energetic
of
diplomatists
deeply
interested
a
student
of
whose
mind
had
lost
itself
in
the
attempt
to
invent
scales
of
force
the
air
of
official
russia
seemed
most
dramatic
in
the
air
of
the
white
house
by
contrast
with
the
outspoken
candor
of
the
president
reticence
had
no
place
there
every
one
in
america
saw
that
whether
russia
or
japan
were
victim
one
of
the
decisive
struggles
in
american
history
was
pending
and
any
pretence
of
secrecy
or
indifference
was
absurd
interest
was
acute
and
curiosity
intense
for
no
one
knew
what
the
russian
government
meant
or
wanted
while
war
had
become
a
question
of
days
to
an
impartial
student
who
gravely
doubted
whether
the
czar
himself
acted
as
a
conscious
force
or
an
inert
weight
the
avowals
of
roosevelt
had
singular
value
as
a
standard
of
measure
by
chance
it
happened
that
adams
was
obliged
to
take
the
place
of
his
brother
brooks
at
the
diplomatic
reception
immediately
after
his
return
home
and
the
part
of
proxy
included
his
supping
at
the
president
table
with
secretary
root
on
one
side
the
president
opposite
and
miss
chamberlain
between
them
naturally
the
president
talked
and
the
guests
listened
which
seemed
to
one
who
had
just
escaped
from
the
european
conspiracy
of
silence
like
drawing
a
free
breath
after
stifling
roosevelt
as
every
one
knew
was
always
an
amusing
talker
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
indiscreet
beyond
any
other
man
of
great
importance
in
the
world
except
the
kaiser
wilhelm
and
joseph
chamberlain
the
father
of
his
guest
at
table
and
this
evening
he
spared
none
with
the
usual
abuse
of
the
quos
ego
common
to
vigorous
statesmen
he
said
all
that
he
thought
about
russians
and
japanese
as
well
as
about
boers
and
british
without
restraint
in
full
hearing
of
twenty
people
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
his
listener
and
concluded
by
declaring
that
war
was
imminent
that
it
ought
to
be
stopped
that
it
could
be
stopped
i
could
do
it
myself
i
could
stop
it
and
he
went
on
to
explain
his
reasons
for
restraint
that
he
was
right
and
that
within
another
generation
his
successor
would
do
what
he
would
have
liked
to
do
made
no
shadow
of
doubt
in
the
mind
of
his
hearer
though
it
would
have
been
folly
when
he
last
supped
at
the
white
house
in
the
dynasty
of
president
hayes
but
the
listener
cared
less
for
the
assertion
of
power
than
for
the
vigor
of
view
the
truth
was
evident
enough
ordinary
even
commonplace
if
one
liked
but
it
was
not
a
truth
of
inertia
nor
was
the
method
to
be
mistaken
for
inert
nor
could
the
force
of
japan
be
mistaken
for
a
moment
as
a
force
of
inertia
although
its
aggressive
was
taken
as
methodically
as
mathematically
as
a
demonstration
of
euclid
and
adams
thought
that
as
against
any
but
russians
it
would
have
lost
its
opening
each
day
counted
as
a
measure
of
relative
energy
on
the
historical
scale
and
the
whole
story
made
a
grammar
of
new
science
quite
as
instructive
as
that
of
pearson
the
forces
thus
launched
were
bound
to
reach
some
new
equilibrium
which
would
prove
the
problem
in
one
sense
or
another
and
the
war
had
no
personal
value
for
adams
except
that
it
gave
hay
his
last
great
triumph
he
had
carried
on
his
long
contest
with
cassini
so
skillfully
that
no
one
knew
enough
to
understand
the
diplomatic
perfection
of
his
work
which
contained
no
error
but
such
success
is
complete
only
when
it
is
invisible
and
his
victory
at
last
was
victory
of
judgment
not
of
act
he
could
do
nothing
and
the
whole
country
would
have
sprung
on
him
had
he
tried
japan
and
england
saved
his
open
door
and
fought
his
battle
all
that
remained
for
him
was
to
make
the
peace
and
adams
set
his
heart
on
getting
the
peace
quickly
in
hand
for
hay
sake
as
well
as
for
that
of
russia
he
thought
then
that
it
could
be
done
in
one
campaign
for
he
knew
that
in
a
military
sense
the
fall
of
port
arthur
must
lead
to
negotiation
and
every
one
felt
that
hay
would
inevitably
direct
it
but
the
race
was
close
and
while
the
war
grew
every
day
in
proportions
hay
strength
every
day
declined
gaudens
came
on
to
model
his
head
and
sargent
painted
his
portrait
two
steps
essential
to
immortality
which
he
bore
with
a
certain
degree
of
resignation
but
he
grumbled
when
the
president
made
him
go
to
louis
to
address
some
gathering
at
the
exposition
and
hay
bade
adams
go
with
them
for
whatever
use
he
could
suppose
himself
to
serve
he
professed
the
religion
of
world
fairs
without
which
he
held
education
to
be
a
blind
impossibility
and
obeyed
hay
bidding
the
more
readily
because
it
united
his
two
educations
in
one
but
theory
and
practice
were
put
to
equally
severe
test
at
louis
ten
years
had
passed
since
he
last
crossed
the
mississippi
and
he
found
everything
new
in
this
great
region
from
pittsburgh
through
ohio
and
indiana
agriculture
had
made
way
for
steam
tall
chimneys
reeked
smoke
on
every
horizon
and
dirty
suburbs
filled
with
and
cinders
formed
the
setting
of
every
town
evidently
cleanliness
was
not
to
be
the
birthmark
of
the
new
american
but
this
matter
of
discards
concerned
the
measure
of
force
little
while
the
chimneys
and
cinders
concerned
it
so
much
that
adams
thought
the
secretary
of
state
should
have
rushed
to
the
platform
at
every
station
to
ask
who
were
the
people
for
the
american
of
the
prime
seemed
to
be
extinct
with
the
shawnee
and
the
buffalo
the
subject
grew
quickly
delicate
history
told
little
about
these
millions
of
germans
and
slavs
or
whatever
their
who
had
overflowed
these
regions
as
though
the
rhine
and
the
danube
had
turned
their
floods
into
the
ohio
john
hay
was
as
strange
to
the
mississippi
river
as
though
he
had
not
been
bred
on
its
shores
and
the
city
of
louis
had
turned
its
back
on
the
noblest
work
of
nature
leaving
it
bankrupt
between
its
own
banks
the
new
american
showed
his
parentage
proudly
he
was
the
child
of
steam
and
the
brother
of
the
dynamo
and
already
within
less
than
thirty
years
this
mass
of
mixed
humanities
brought
together
by
steam
was
squeezed
and
welded
into
approach
to
shape
a
product
of
so
much
mechanical
power
and
bearing
no
distinctive
marks
but
that
of
its
pressure
the
new
american
like
the
new
european
was
the
servant
of
the
powerhouse
as
the
european
of
the
twelfth
century
was
the
servant
of
the
church
and
the
features
would
follow
the
parentage
the
louis
exposition
was
its
first
creation
in
the
twentieth
century
and
for
that
reason
acutely
interesting
one
saw
here
a
town
of
people
without
history
education
unity
or
art
and
with
little
capital
without
even
an
element
of
natural
interest
except
the
river
which
it
studiously
ignored
but
doing
what
london
paris
or
new
york
would
have
shrunk
from
attempting
this
new
social
conglomerate
with
no
tie
but
its
and
not
much
of
that
threw
away
thirty
or
forty
million
dollars
on
a
pageant
as
ephemeral
as
a
stage
flat
the
world
had
never
witnessed
so
marvellous
a
phantasm
by
night
arabia
crimson
sands
had
never
returned
a
glow
half
so
astonishing
as
one
wandered
among
long
lines
of
white
palaces
exquisitely
lighted
by
thousands
on
thousands
of
electric
candles
soft
rich
shadowy
palpable
in
their
sensuous
depths
all
in
deep
silence
profound
solitude
listening
for
a
voice
or
a
or
the
plash
of
an
oar
as
though
the
emir
mirza
were
displaying
the
beauties
of
this
city
of
brass
which
could
show
nothing
half
so
beautiful
as
this
illumination
with
its
vast
white
monumental
solitude
bathed
in
the
pure
light
of
setting
suns
one
enjoyed
it
with
iniquitous
rapture
not
because
of
exhibits
but
rather
because
of
their
want
here
was
a
paradox
like
the
stellar
universe
that
fitted
one
mental
faults
had
there
been
no
exhibits
at
all
and
no
visitors
one
would
have
enjoyed
it
only
the
more
here
education
found
new
forage
that
the
power
was
wasted
the
art
indifferent
the
economic
failure
complete
added
just
so
much
to
the
interest
the
chaos
of
education
approached
a
dream
one
asked
one
self
whether
this
extravagance
reflected
the
past
or
imaged
the
future
whether
it
was
a
creation
of
the
old
american
or
a
promise
of
the
new
one
no
prophet
could
be
believed
but
a
pilgrim
of
power
without
constituency
to
flatter
might
allow
himself
to
hope
the
prospect
from
the
exposition
was
pleasant
one
seemed
to
see
almost
an
adequate
motive
for
power
almost
a
scheme
for
progress
in
another
the
people
of
the
central
valleys
should
have
hundreds
of
millions
to
throw
away
more
easily
than
in
they
could
throw
away
tens
and
by
that
time
they
might
know
what
they
wanted
possibly
they
might
even
have
learned
how
to
reach
it
this
was
an
optimist
hope
shared
by
few
except
pilgrims
of
world
fairs
and
frankly
dropped
by
the
multitude
for
east
of
the
mississippi
the
louis
exposition
met
a
deliberate
conspiracy
of
silence
discouraging
beyond
measure
to
an
optimistic
dream
of
future
strength
in
american
expression
the
party
got
back
to
washington
on
may
and
before
sailing
for
europe
adams
went
over
one
warm
evening
to
bid
on
the
of
the
white
house
he
found
himself
the
first
person
who
urged
roosevelt
to
visit
the
exposition
for
its
beauty
and
as
far
as
he
ever
knew
the
last
he
left
louis
may
and
on
sunday
june
found
himself
again
in
the
town
of
coutances
where
the
people
of
normandy
had
built
towards
the
year
an
exposition
which
architects
still
admired
and
tourists
visited
for
it
was
thought
singularly
expressive
of
force
as
well
as
of
grace
in
the
virgin
on
this
sunday
the
norman
world
was
celebrating
a
pretty
the
fete
dieu
and
the
streets
were
filled
with
altars
to
the
virgin
covered
with
flowers
and
foliage
the
pavements
strewn
with
paths
of
leaves
and
the
spring
handiwork
of
nature
the
cathedral
densely
thronged
at
mass
the
scene
was
graceful
the
virgin
did
not
shut
her
costly
exposition
on
sunday
or
any
other
day
even
to
american
senators
who
had
shut
the
louis
exposition
to
her
or
for
her
and
a
historical
tramp
would
gladly
have
offered
a
candle
or
even
a
in
her
honor
if
she
would
have
taught
him
her
relation
with
the
deity
of
the
senators
the
power
of
the
virgin
had
been
plainly
one
embracing
all
human
activity
while
the
power
of
the
senate
or
its
deity
seemed
might
one
say
to
be
more
or
less
ashamed
of
man
and
his
work
the
matter
had
no
great
interest
as
far
as
it
concerned
the
somewhat
obscure
mental
processes
of
senators
who
could
probably
have
given
no
clearer
idea
than
priests
of
the
deity
they
supposed
themselves
to
honor
if
that
was
indeed
their
purpose
but
it
interested
a
student
of
force
curious
to
measure
its
manifestations
apparently
the
virgin
or
her
son
had
no
longer
the
force
to
build
expositions
that
one
cared
to
visit
but
had
the
force
to
close
them
the
force
was
still
real
serious
and
at
louis
had
been
anxiously
measured
in
actual
that
it
was
actual
and
serious
in
france
as
in
the
senate
chamber
at
washington
proved
itself
at
once
by
forcing
adams
to
buy
an
automobile
which
was
a
supreme
demonstration
because
this
was
the
form
of
force
which
adams
most
abominated
he
had
set
aside
the
summer
for
study
of
the
virgin
not
as
a
sentiment
but
as
a
motive
power
which
had
left
monuments
widely
scattered
and
not
easily
reached
the
automobile
alone
could
unite
them
in
any
reasonable
sequence
and
although
the
force
of
the
automobile
for
the
purposes
of
a
commercial
traveller
seemed
to
have
no
relation
whatever
to
the
force
that
inspired
a
gothic
cathedral
the
virgin
in
the
twelfth
century
would
have
guided
and
controlled
both
and
architect
as
she
controlled
the
seeker
of
history
in
his
mind
the
problem
offered
itself
as
to
newton
it
was
a
matter
of
mutual
attraction
and
he
knew
it
in
his
own
case
to
be
a
formula
as
precise
as
s
if
he
could
but
experimentally
prove
it
of
the
attraction
he
needed
no
proof
on
his
own
account
the
costs
of
his
automobile
were
more
than
sufficient
but
as
teacher
he
needed
to
speak
for
others
than
himself
for
him
the
virgin
was
an
adorable
mistress
who
led
the
automobile
and
its
owner
where
she
would
to
her
wonderful
palaces
and
chateaux
from
chartres
to
rouen
and
thence
to
amiens
and
laon
and
a
score
of
others
kindly
receiving
amusing
charming
and
dazzling
her
lover
as
though
she
were
aphrodite
herself
worth
all
else
that
man
ever
dreamed
he
never
doubted
her
force
since
he
felt
it
to
the
last
fibre
of
his
being
and
could
not
more
dispute
its
mastery
than
he
could
dispute
the
force
of
gravitation
of
which
he
knew
nothing
but
the
formula
he
was
only
too
glad
to
yield
himself
entirely
not
to
her
charm
or
to
any
sentimentality
of
religion
but
to
her
mental
and
physical
energy
of
creation
which
had
built
up
these
world
fairs
of
force
that
turned
chicago
and
louis
pale
both
were
faiths
and
both
are
gone
said
matthew
arnold
of
the
greek
and
norse
divinities
but
the
business
of
a
student
was
to
ask
where
they
had
gone
the
virgin
had
not
even
altogether
gone
her
fading
away
had
been
excessively
slow
her
adorer
had
pursued
her
too
long
too
far
and
into
too
many
manifestations
of
her
power
to
admit
that
she
had
any
equivalent
either
of
quantity
or
kind
in
the
actual
world
but
he
could
still
less
admit
her
annihilation
as
energy
so
he
went
on
wooing
happy
in
the
thought
that
at
last
he
had
found
a
mistress
who
could
see
no
difference
in
the
age
of
her
lovers
her
own
age
had
no
for
years
past
incited
by
john
la
farge
adams
had
devoted
his
summer
schooling
to
the
study
of
her
glass
at
chartres
and
elsewhere
and
if
the
automobile
had
one
vitesse
more
useful
than
another
it
was
that
of
a
century
a
minute
that
of
passing
from
one
century
to
another
without
break
the
centuries
dropped
like
autumn
leaves
in
one
road
and
one
was
not
fined
for
running
over
them
too
fast
when
the
thirteenth
lost
breath
the
fourteenth
caught
on
and
the
sixteenth
ran
close
ahead
the
hunt
for
the
virgin
glass
opened
rich
preserves
especially
the
sixteenth
century
ran
riot
in
sensuous
worship
then
the
ocean
of
religion
which
had
flooded
france
broke
into
shelley
light
dissolved
in
thrown
which
had
left
every
remote
village
strewn
with
fragments
that
flashed
like
jewels
and
were
tossed
into
hidden
clefts
of
peace
and
forgetfulness
one
dared
not
pass
a
parish
church
in
champagne
or
touraine
without
stopping
to
look
for
its
window
of
fragments
where
one
glass
discovered
the
in
his
manger
nursed
by
the
head
of
a
fragmentary
donkey
with
a
cupid
playing
into
its
long
ears
from
the
balustrade
of
a
venetian
palace
guarded
by
a
legless
flemish
leibwache
standing
on
his
head
with
a
broken
halbert
all
invoked
in
prayer
by
remnants
of
the
donors
and
their
children
that
might
have
been
drawn
by
fouquet
or
pinturicchio
in
colors
as
fresh
and
living
as
the
day
they
were
burned
in
and
with
feeling
that
still
consoled
the
faithful
for
the
paradise
they
had
paid
for
and
lost
france
abounds
in
glass
paris
alone
contains
acres
of
it
and
the
neighborhood
within
fifty
miles
contains
scores
of
churches
where
the
student
may
still
imagine
himself
three
hundred
years
old
kneeling
before
the
virgin
window
in
the
silent
solitude
of
an
empty
faith
crying
his
culp
beating
his
breast
confessing
his
historical
sins
weighed
down
by
the
rubbish
of
years
education
and
still
desperately
hoping
to
understand
he
understood
a
little
though
not
much
the
sixteenth
century
had
a
value
of
its
own
as
though
the
one
had
become
several
and
unity
had
counted
more
than
three
though
the
multiple
still
showed
modest
numbers
the
glass
had
gone
back
to
the
roman
empire
and
forward
to
the
american
continent
it
betrayed
sympathy
with
montaigne
and
shakespeare
but
the
virgin
was
still
supreme
at
beauvais
in
the
church
of
stephen
was
a
superb
tree
of
jesse
famous
as
the
work
of
engrand
le
prince
about
or
in
whose
branches
among
the
fourteen
ancestors
of
the
virgin
bore
features
of
the
kings
of
france
among
them
francis
i
and
henry
ii
who
were
hardly
more
edifying
than
kings
of
israel
and
at
least
unusual
as
sources
of
divine
purity
compared
with
the
still
more
famous
tree
of
jesse
at
chartres
dating
from
or
thereabouts
must
one
declare
that
engrand
le
prince
proved
progress
and
in
what
direction
complexity
multiplicity
even
a
step
towards
anarchy
it
might
suggest
but
what
step
towards
perfection
one
late
afternoon
at
midsummer
the
virgin
pilgrim
was
wandering
through
the
streets
of
troyes
in
close
and
intimate
conversation
with
thibaut
of
champagne
and
his
highly
intelligent
seneschal
the
sieur
de
joinville
when
he
noticed
one
or
two
men
looking
at
a
bit
of
paper
stuck
in
a
window
approaching
he
read
that
de
plehve
had
been
assassinated
at
petersburg
the
mad
mixture
of
russia
and
the
crusades
of
the
hippodrome
and
the
renaissance
drove
him
for
refuge
into
the
fascinating
church
of
pantaleon
near
by
martyrs
murderers
caesars
saints
and
assassins
half
in
glass
and
half
in
telegram
chaos
of
time
place
morals
forces
and
motive
gave
him
vertigo
had
one
sat
all
one
life
on
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
for
this
was
assassination
forever
to
be
the
last
word
of
progress
no
one
in
the
street
had
shown
a
sign
of
protest
he
himself
felt
none
the
charming
church
with
its
delightful
windows
in
its
exquisite
absence
of
other
tourists
took
a
keener
expression
of
celestial
peace
than
could
have
been
given
it
by
any
contrast
short
of
explosive
murder
the
conservative
christian
anarchist
had
come
to
his
own
but
which
was
he
the
murderer
or
the
murdered
the
virgin
herself
never
looked
so
winning
so
one
as
in
this
scandalous
failure
of
her
grace
to
what
purpose
had
she
existed
if
after
nineteen
hundred
years
the
world
was
bloodier
than
when
she
was
born
the
stupendous
failure
of
christianity
tortured
history
the
effort
for
unity
could
not
be
a
partial
success
even
alternating
unity
resolved
itself
into
meaningless
motion
at
last
to
the
tired
student
the
idea
that
he
must
give
it
up
seemed
sheer
senility
as
long
as
he
could
whisper
he
would
go
on
as
he
had
begun
bluntly
refusing
to
meet
his
creator
with
the
admission
that
the
creation
had
taught
him
nothing
except
that
the
square
of
the
hypothenuse
of
a
triangle
might
for
convenience
be
taken
as
equal
to
something
else
every
man
with
enough
to
become
effective
if
only
as
a
machine
has
had
to
account
to
himself
for
himself
somehow
and
to
invent
a
formula
of
his
own
for
his
universe
if
the
standard
formulas
failed
there
whether
finished
or
not
education
stopped
the
formula
once
made
could
be
but
verified
the
effort
must
begin
at
once
for
time
pressed
the
old
formulas
had
failed
and
a
new
one
had
to
be
made
but
after
all
the
object
was
not
extravagant
or
eccentric
one
sought
no
absolute
truth
one
sought
only
a
spool
on
which
to
wind
the
thread
of
history
without
breaking
it
among
indefinite
possible
orbits
one
sought
the
orbit
which
would
best
satisfy
the
observed
movement
of
the
runaway
star
groombridge
commonly
called
henry
adams
as
term
of
a
education
one
sought
a
common
factor
for
certain
definite
historical
fractions
any
schoolboy
could
work
out
the
problem
if
he
were
given
the
right
to
state
it
in
his
own
terms
therefore
when
the
fogs
and
frosts
stopped
his
slaughter
of
the
centuries
and
shut
him
up
again
in
his
garret
he
sat
down
as
though
he
were
again
a
boy
at
school
to
shape
after
his
own
needs
the
values
of
a
dynamic
theory
of
history
chapter
xxxiii
a
dynamic
theory
of
history
a
dynamic
theory
like
most
theories
begins
by
begging
the
question
it
defines
progress
as
the
development
and
economy
of
forces
further
it
defines
force
as
anything
that
does
or
helps
to
do
work
man
is
a
force
so
is
the
sun
so
is
a
mathematical
point
though
without
dimensions
or
known
existence
man
commonly
begs
the
question
again
taking
for
granted
that
he
captures
the
forces
a
dynamic
theory
assigning
attractive
force
to
opposing
bodies
in
proportion
to
the
law
of
mass
takes
for
granted
that
the
forces
of
nature
capture
man
the
sum
of
force
attracts
the
feeble
atom
or
molecule
called
man
is
attracted
he
suffers
education
or
growth
he
is
the
sum
of
the
forces
that
attract
him
his
body
and
his
thought
are
alike
their
product
the
movement
of
the
forces
controls
the
progress
of
his
mind
since
he
can
know
nothing
but
the
motions
which
impinge
on
his
senses
whose
sum
makes
education
for
convenience
as
an
image
the
theory
may
liken
man
to
a
spider
in
its
web
watching
for
chance
prey
forces
of
nature
dance
like
flies
before
the
net
and
the
spider
pounces
on
them
when
it
can
but
it
makes
many
fatal
mistakes
though
its
theory
of
force
is
sound
the
acquires
a
faculty
of
memory
and
with
it
a
singular
skill
of
analysis
and
synthesis
taking
apart
and
putting
together
in
different
relations
the
meshes
of
its
trap
man
had
in
the
beginning
no
power
of
analysis
or
synthesis
approaching
that
of
the
spider
or
even
of
the
he
had
acute
sensibility
to
the
higher
forces
fire
taught
him
secrets
that
no
other
animal
could
learn
running
water
probably
taught
him
even
more
especially
in
his
first
lessons
of
mechanics
the
animals
helped
to
educate
him
trusting
themselves
into
his
hands
merely
for
the
sake
of
their
food
and
carrying
his
burdens
or
supplying
his
clothing
the
grasses
and
grains
were
academies
of
study
with
little
or
no
effort
on
his
part
all
these
forces
formed
his
thought
induced
his
action
and
even
shaped
his
figure
long
before
history
began
his
education
was
complete
for
the
record
could
not
have
been
started
until
he
had
been
taught
to
record
the
universe
that
had
formed
him
took
shape
in
his
mind
as
a
reflection
of
his
own
unity
containing
all
forces
except
himself
either
separately
or
in
groups
or
as
a
whole
these
forces
never
ceased
to
act
on
him
enlarging
his
mind
as
they
enlarged
the
surface
foliage
of
a
vegetable
and
the
mind
needed
only
to
respond
as
the
forests
did
to
these
attractions
susceptibility
to
the
highest
forces
is
the
highest
genius
selection
between
them
is
the
highest
science
their
mass
is
the
highest
educator
man
always
made
and
still
makes
grotesque
blunders
in
selecting
and
measuring
forces
taken
at
random
from
the
heap
but
he
never
made
a
mistake
in
the
value
he
set
on
the
whole
which
he
symbolized
as
unity
and
worshipped
as
god
to
this
day
his
attitude
towards
it
has
never
changed
though
science
can
no
longer
give
to
force
a
name
man
function
as
a
force
of
nature
was
to
assimilate
other
forces
as
he
assimilated
food
he
called
it
the
love
of
power
he
felt
his
own
feebleness
and
he
sought
for
an
ass
or
a
camel
a
bow
or
a
sling
to
widen
his
range
of
power
as
he
sought
fetish
or
a
planet
in
the
world
beyond
he
cared
little
to
know
its
immediate
use
but
he
could
afford
to
throw
nothing
away
which
he
could
conceive
to
have
possible
value
in
this
or
any
other
existence
he
waited
for
the
object
to
teach
him
its
use
or
want
of
use
and
the
process
was
slow
he
may
have
gone
on
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
waiting
for
nature
to
tell
him
her
secrets
and
to
his
rivals
among
the
monkeys
nature
has
taught
no
more
than
at
their
start
but
certain
lines
of
force
were
capable
of
acting
on
individual
apes
and
mechanically
selecting
types
of
race
or
sources
of
variation
the
individual
that
responded
or
reacted
to
lines
of
new
force
then
was
possibly
the
same
individual
that
reacts
on
it
now
and
his
conception
of
the
unity
seems
never
to
have
changed
in
spite
of
the
increasing
diversity
of
forces
but
the
theory
of
variation
is
an
affair
of
other
science
than
history
and
matters
nothing
to
dynamics
the
individual
or
the
race
would
be
educated
on
the
same
lines
of
illusion
which
according
to
arthur
balfour
had
not
essentially
varied
down
to
the
year
to
the
highest
attractive
energy
man
gave
the
name
of
divine
and
for
its
control
he
invented
the
science
called
religion
a
word
which
meant
and
still
means
cultivation
of
occult
force
whether
in
detail
or
mass
unable
to
define
force
as
a
unity
man
symbolized
it
and
pursued
it
both
in
himself
and
in
the
infinite
as
philosophy
and
theology
the
mind
is
itself
the
subtlest
of
all
known
forces
and
its
necessarily
created
a
science
which
had
the
singular
value
of
lifting
his
education
at
the
start
to
the
finest
subtlest
and
broadest
training
both
in
analysis
and
synthesis
so
that
if
language
is
a
test
he
must
have
reached
his
highest
powers
early
in
his
history
while
the
mere
motive
remained
as
simple
an
appetite
for
power
as
the
tribal
greed
which
led
him
to
trap
an
elephant
hunger
whether
for
food
or
for
the
infinite
sets
in
motion
multiplicity
and
infinity
of
thought
and
the
sure
hope
of
gaining
a
share
of
infinite
power
in
eternal
life
would
lift
most
minds
to
effort
he
had
reached
this
completeness
five
thousand
years
ago
and
added
nothing
to
his
stock
of
known
forces
for
a
very
long
time
the
mass
of
nature
exercised
on
him
so
feeble
an
attraction
that
one
can
scarcely
account
for
his
apparent
motion
only
a
historian
of
very
exceptional
knowledge
would
venture
to
say
at
what
date
between
and
the
momentum
of
europe
was
greatest
but
such
progress
as
the
world
made
consisted
in
economies
of
energy
rather
than
in
its
development
it
was
proved
in
mathematics
measured
by
names
like
archimedes
aristarchus
ptolemy
and
euclid
or
in
civil
law
measured
by
a
number
of
names
which
adams
had
begun
life
by
failing
to
learn
or
in
coinage
which
was
most
beautiful
near
its
beginning
and
most
barbarous
at
its
close
or
it
was
shown
in
roads
or
the
size
of
ships
or
harbors
or
by
the
use
of
metals
instruments
and
writing
all
of
them
economies
of
force
sometimes
more
forceful
than
the
forces
they
helped
but
the
roads
were
still
travelled
by
the
horse
the
ass
the
camel
or
the
slave
the
ships
were
still
propelled
by
sails
or
oars
the
lever
the
spring
and
the
screw
bounded
the
region
of
applied
mechanics
even
the
metals
were
old
much
the
same
thing
could
be
said
of
religious
or
supernatural
forces
down
to
the
year
of
the
christian
era
they
were
little
changed
and
in
spite
of
plato
and
the
sceptics
were
more
apparently
chaotic
than
ever
the
experience
of
three
thousand
years
had
educated
society
to
feel
the
vastness
of
nature
and
the
infinity
of
her
resources
of
power
but
even
this
increase
of
attraction
had
not
yet
caused
economies
in
its
methods
of
pursuit
there
the
western
world
stood
till
the
year
when
the
emperor
diocletian
abdicated
and
there
it
was
that
adams
broke
down
on
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
his
path
blocked
by
the
scandalous
failure
of
civilization
at
the
moment
it
had
achieved
complete
success
in
the
year
the
empire
had
solved
the
problems
of
europe
more
completely
than
they
have
ever
been
solved
since
the
pax
romana
the
civil
law
and
free
trade
should
in
four
hundred
years
have
put
europe
far
in
advance
of
the
point
reached
by
modern
society
in
the
four
hundred
years
since
when
conditions
were
less
simple
the
efforts
to
explain
or
explain
away
this
scandal
had
been
incessant
but
none
suited
adams
unless
it
were
the
economic
theory
of
adverse
exchanges
and
exhaustion
of
minerals
but
nations
are
not
ruined
beyond
a
certain
point
by
adverse
exchanges
and
rome
had
by
no
means
exhausted
her
resources
on
the
contrary
the
empire
developed
resources
and
energies
quite
astounding
no
other
four
hundred
years
of
history
before
knew
anything
like
it
and
although
some
of
these
developments
like
the
civil
law
the
roads
aqueducts
and
harbors
were
rather
economies
than
force
yet
in
northwestern
europe
alone
the
empire
had
developed
three
energies
france
england
and
germany
competent
to
master
the
world
the
trouble
seemed
rather
to
be
that
the
empire
developed
too
much
energy
and
too
fast
a
dynamic
law
requires
that
two
masses
nature
and
man
must
go
on
reacting
upon
each
other
without
stop
as
the
sun
and
a
comet
react
on
each
other
and
that
any
appearance
of
stoppage
is
illusive
the
theory
seems
to
exact
excess
rather
than
deficiency
of
action
and
reaction
to
account
for
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
empire
which
should
as
a
problem
of
mechanics
have
been
torn
to
pieces
by
acceleration
if
the
student
means
to
try
the
experiment
of
framing
a
dynamic
law
he
must
assign
values
to
the
forces
of
attraction
that
caused
the
trouble
and
in
this
case
he
has
them
in
plain
evidence
with
the
relentless
logic
that
stamped
roman
thought
the
empire
which
had
established
unity
on
earth
could
not
help
establishing
unity
in
heaven
it
was
induced
by
its
dynamic
necessities
to
economize
the
gods
the
church
has
never
ceased
to
protest
against
the
charge
that
christianity
ruined
the
empire
and
with
its
usual
force
has
pointed
out
that
its
reforms
alone
saved
the
state
any
dynamic
theory
gladly
admits
it
all
it
asks
is
to
find
and
follow
the
force
that
attracts
the
church
points
out
this
force
in
the
cross
and
history
needs
only
to
follow
it
the
empire
loudly
asserted
its
motive
good
taste
forbids
saying
that
constantine
the
great
speculated
as
audaciously
as
a
modern
on
values
of
which
he
knew
at
the
utmost
only
the
volume
or
that
he
merged
all
uncertain
forces
into
a
single
trust
which
he
enormously
overcapitalized
and
forced
on
the
market
but
this
is
the
substance
of
what
constantine
himself
said
in
his
edict
of
milan
in
the
year
which
admitted
christianity
into
the
trust
of
state
religions
regarded
as
an
act
of
congress
it
runs
we
have
resolved
to
grant
to
christians
as
well
as
all
others
the
liberty
to
practice
the
religion
they
prefer
in
order
that
whatever
exists
of
divinity
or
celestial
power
may
help
and
favor
us
and
all
who
are
under
our
government
the
empire
pursued
power
not
merely
spiritual
but
physical
in
the
sense
in
which
constantine
issued
his
army
order
the
year
before
at
the
battle
of
the
milvian
bridge
in
hoc
signo
vinces
using
the
cross
as
a
train
of
artillery
which
to
his
mind
it
was
society
accepted
it
in
the
same
character
eighty
years
afterwards
theodosius
marched
against
his
rival
eugene
with
the
cross
for
physical
champion
and
eugene
raised
the
image
of
hercules
to
fight
for
the
pagans
while
society
on
both
sides
looked
on
as
though
it
were
a
to
decide
a
final
test
of
force
between
the
divine
powers
the
church
was
powerless
to
raise
the
ideal
what
is
now
known
as
religion
affected
the
mind
of
old
society
but
little
the
laity
the
people
the
million
almost
to
a
man
bet
on
the
gods
as
they
bet
on
a
horse
no
doubt
the
church
did
all
it
could
to
purify
the
process
but
society
was
almost
wholly
pagan
in
its
point
of
view
and
was
drawn
to
the
cross
because
in
its
system
of
physics
the
cross
had
absorbed
all
the
old
occult
or
the
symbol
represented
the
sum
of
nature
the
energy
of
modern
science
and
society
believed
it
to
be
as
real
as
perhaps
it
was
the
emperors
used
it
like
gunpowder
in
politics
the
physicians
used
it
like
rays
in
medicine
the
dying
clung
to
it
as
the
quintessence
of
force
to
protect
them
from
the
forces
of
evil
on
their
road
to
the
next
life
throughout
these
four
centuries
the
empire
knew
that
religion
disturbed
economy
for
even
the
cost
of
heathen
incense
affected
the
exchanges
but
no
one
could
afford
to
buy
or
construct
a
costly
and
complicated
machine
when
he
could
hire
an
occult
force
at
trifling
expense
was
cheap
and
satisfactory
down
to
a
certain
point
turgot
and
auguste
comte
long
ago
fixed
this
stage
of
economy
as
a
necessary
phase
of
social
education
and
historians
seem
now
to
accept
it
as
the
only
gain
yet
made
towards
scientific
history
great
numbers
of
educated
people
perhaps
a
majority
cling
to
the
method
still
and
practice
it
more
or
less
strictly
but
until
quite
recently
no
other
was
known
the
only
occult
power
at
man
disposal
was
fetish
against
it
no
mechanical
force
could
compete
except
within
narrow
limits
outside
of
occult
or
the
roman
world
was
incredibly
poor
it
knew
but
one
productive
energy
resembling
a
modern
machine
the
slave
no
artificial
force
of
serious
value
was
applied
to
production
or
transportation
and
when
society
developed
itself
so
rapidly
in
political
and
social
lines
it
had
no
other
means
of
keeping
its
economy
on
the
same
level
than
to
extend
its
and
its
to
the
utmost
the
result
might
have
been
stated
in
a
mathematical
formula
as
early
as
the
time
of
archimedes
six
hundred
years
before
rome
fell
the
economic
needs
of
a
violently
centralizing
society
forced
the
empire
to
enlarge
its
until
the
consumed
itself
and
the
empire
too
leaving
society
no
resource
but
further
enlargement
of
its
religious
system
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
losses
and
horrors
of
the
failure
for
a
vicious
circle
its
mathematical
completeness
approached
perfection
the
dynamic
law
of
attraction
and
reaction
needed
only
a
newton
to
fix
it
in
algebraic
form
at
last
in
alaric
sacked
rome
and
the
agricultural
uncommercial
western
empire
the
poorer
and
less
christianized
half
went
to
pieces
society
though
terribly
shocked
by
the
horrors
of
alaric
storm
felt
still
more
deeply
the
disappointment
in
its
new
power
the
cross
which
had
failed
to
protect
its
church
the
outcry
against
the
cross
became
so
loud
among
christians
that
its
literary
champion
bishop
augustine
of
hippo
a
town
between
algiers
and
tunis
was
led
to
write
a
famous
treatise
in
defence
of
the
cross
familiar
still
to
every
scholar
in
which
he
defended
feebly
the
mechanical
value
of
the
symbol
arguing
only
that
pagan
symbols
equally
failed
but
insisted
on
its
spiritual
value
in
the
civitas
dei
which
had
taken
the
place
of
the
civitas
romae
in
human
interest
granted
that
we
have
lost
all
we
had
have
we
lost
faith
have
we
lost
piety
have
we
lost
the
wealth
of
the
inner
man
who
is
rich
before
god
these
are
the
wealth
of
christians
the
civitas
dei
in
its
turn
became
the
sum
of
attraction
for
the
western
world
though
it
also
showed
the
same
weakness
in
mechanics
that
had
wrecked
the
civitas
romae
augustine
and
his
people
perished
at
hippo
towards
leaving
society
in
appearance
dull
to
new
attraction
yet
the
attraction
remained
constant
the
delight
of
experimenting
on
occult
force
of
every
kind
is
such
as
to
absorb
all
the
free
thought
of
the
human
race
the
gods
did
their
work
history
has
no
quarrel
with
them
they
led
educated
enlarged
the
mind
taught
knowledge
betrayed
ignorance
stimulated
effort
so
little
is
known
about
the
mind
whether
social
racial
sexual
or
heritable
whether
material
or
spiritual
whether
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
that
history
is
inclined
to
avoid
it
altogether
but
nothing
forbids
one
to
admit
for
convenience
that
it
may
assimilate
food
like
the
body
storing
new
force
and
growing
like
a
forest
with
the
storage
the
brain
has
not
yet
revealed
its
mysterious
mechanism
of
gray
matter
never
has
nature
offered
it
so
violent
a
stimulant
as
when
she
opened
to
it
the
possibility
of
sharing
infinite
power
in
eternal
life
and
it
might
well
need
a
thousand
years
of
prolonged
and
intense
experiment
to
prove
the
value
of
the
motive
during
these
middle
ages
the
western
mind
reacted
in
many
forms
on
many
sides
expressing
its
motives
in
modes
such
as
romanesque
and
gothic
architecture
glass
windows
and
mosaic
walls
sculpture
and
poetry
war
and
love
which
still
affect
some
people
as
the
noblest
work
of
man
so
that
even
great
masses
of
idle
and
ignorant
tourists
travel
from
far
countries
to
look
at
ravenna
and
san
marco
palermo
and
pisa
assisi
cordova
chartres
with
vague
notions
about
the
force
that
created
them
but
with
a
certain
surprise
that
a
social
mind
of
such
singular
energy
and
unity
should
still
lurk
in
their
shadows
the
tourist
more
rarely
visits
constantinople
or
studies
the
architecture
of
sancta
sofia
but
when
he
does
he
is
distinctly
conscious
of
forces
not
quite
the
same
justinian
has
not
the
simplicity
of
charlemagne
the
eastern
empire
showed
an
activity
and
variety
of
forces
that
classical
europe
had
never
possessed
the
navy
of
nicephoras
phocas
in
the
tenth
century
would
have
annihilated
in
half
an
hour
any
navy
that
carthage
or
athens
or
rome
ever
set
afloat
the
dynamic
scheme
began
by
asserting
rather
recklessly
that
between
the
pyramids
and
the
cross
no
new
force
affected
western
progress
and
antiquarians
may
easily
dispute
the
fact
but
in
any
case
the
motive
influence
old
or
new
which
raised
both
pyramids
and
cross
was
the
same
attraction
of
power
in
a
future
life
that
raised
the
dome
of
sancta
sofia
and
the
cathedral
at
amiens
however
much
it
was
altered
enlarged
or
removed
to
distance
in
space
therefore
no
single
event
has
more
puzzled
historians
than
the
sudden
unexplained
appearance
of
at
least
two
new
natural
forces
of
the
highest
educational
value
in
mechanics
for
the
first
time
within
record
of
history
literally
these
two
forces
seemed
to
drop
from
the
sky
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
cross
on
one
side
and
the
crescent
on
the
other
proclaimed
the
complete
triumph
of
the
civitas
dei
had
the
manichean
doctrine
of
good
and
evil
as
rival
deities
been
orthodox
it
would
alone
have
accounted
for
this
simultaneous
victory
of
hostile
powers
of
the
compass
as
a
step
towards
demonstration
of
the
dynamic
law
one
may
confidently
say
that
it
proved
better
than
any
other
force
the
widening
scope
of
the
mind
since
it
widened
immensely
the
range
of
contact
between
nature
and
thought
the
compass
educated
this
must
prove
itself
as
needing
no
proof
of
greek
fire
and
gunpowder
the
same
thing
can
not
certainly
be
said
for
they
have
the
air
of
accidents
due
to
the
attraction
of
religious
motives
they
belong
to
the
spiritual
world
or
to
the
doubtful
ground
of
magic
which
lay
between
good
and
evil
they
were
chemical
forces
mostly
explosives
which
acted
and
still
act
as
the
most
violent
educators
ever
known
to
man
but
they
were
justly
feared
as
diabolic
and
whatever
insolence
man
may
have
risked
towards
the
milder
teachers
of
his
infancy
he
was
an
abject
pupil
towards
explosives
the
sieur
de
joinville
left
a
record
of
the
energy
with
which
the
relatively
harmless
greek
fire
educated
and
enlarged
the
french
mind
in
a
single
night
in
the
year
when
the
crusaders
were
trying
to
advance
on
cairo
the
good
king
louis
and
all
his
staff
dropped
on
their
knees
at
every
fiery
flame
that
flew
by
praying
god
have
pity
on
us
and
never
had
man
more
reason
to
call
on
his
gods
than
they
for
the
battle
of
religion
between
christian
and
saracen
was
trifling
compared
with
that
of
education
between
gunpowder
and
the
cross
the
fiction
that
society
educated
itself
or
aimed
at
a
conscious
purpose
was
upset
by
the
compass
and
gunpowder
which
dragged
and
drove
europe
at
will
through
frightful
bogs
of
learning
at
first
the
apparent
lag
for
want
of
volume
in
the
new
energies
lasted
one
or
two
centuries
which
closed
the
great
epochs
of
emotion
by
the
gothic
cathedrals
and
scholastic
theology
the
moment
had
greek
beauty
and
more
than
greek
unity
but
it
was
brief
and
for
another
century
or
two
western
society
seemed
to
float
in
space
without
apparent
motion
yet
the
attractive
mass
of
nature
energy
continued
to
attract
and
education
became
more
rapid
than
ever
before
society
began
to
resist
but
the
individual
showed
greater
and
greater
insistence
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
when
the
crescent
drove
the
cross
in
ignominy
from
constantinople
in
gutenberg
and
fust
were
printing
their
first
bible
at
mainz
under
the
impression
that
they
were
helping
the
cross
when
columbus
discovered
the
west
indies
in
the
church
looked
on
it
as
a
victory
of
the
cross
when
luther
and
calvin
upset
europe
half
a
century
later
they
were
trying
like
augustine
to
substitute
the
civitas
dei
for
the
civitas
romae
when
the
puritans
set
out
for
new
england
in
they
too
were
looking
to
found
a
civitas
dei
in
state
street
and
when
bunyan
made
his
pilgrimage
in
he
repeated
jerome
even
when
after
centuries
of
license
the
church
reformed
its
discipline
and
to
prove
it
burned
giordano
bruno
in
besides
condemning
galileo
in
as
science
goes
on
repeating
to
us
every
day
it
condemned
anarchists
not
atheists
none
of
the
astronomers
were
irreligious
men
all
of
them
made
a
point
of
magnifying
god
through
his
works
a
form
of
science
which
did
their
religion
no
credit
neither
galileo
nor
kepler
neither
spinoza
nor
descartes
neither
leibnitz
nor
newton
any
more
than
constantine
the
great
if
so
much
doubted
unity
the
utmost
range
of
their
heresies
reached
only
its
personality
this
persistence
of
is
the
leading
idea
of
modern
history
except
as
reflected
in
himself
man
has
no
reason
for
assuming
unity
in
the
universe
or
an
ultimate
substance
or
a
the
a
priori
insistence
on
this
unity
ended
by
fatiguing
the
more
active
or
reactive
minds
and
lord
bacon
tried
to
stop
it
he
urged
society
to
lay
aside
the
idea
of
evolving
the
universe
from
a
thought
and
to
try
evolving
thought
from
the
universe
the
mind
should
observe
and
register
forces
take
them
apart
and
put
them
together
without
assuming
unity
at
all
nature
to
be
commanded
must
be
obeyed
the
imagination
must
be
given
not
wings
but
weights
as
galileo
reversed
the
action
of
earth
and
sun
bacon
reversed
the
relation
of
thought
to
force
the
mind
was
thenceforth
to
follow
the
movement
of
matter
and
unity
must
be
left
to
shift
for
itself
the
revolution
in
attitude
seemed
voluntary
but
in
fact
was
as
mechanical
as
the
fall
of
a
feather
man
created
nothing
after
the
speed
of
progress
so
rapidly
surpassed
man
gait
as
to
alarm
every
one
as
though
it
were
the
acceleration
of
a
falling
body
which
the
dynamic
theory
takes
it
to
be
lord
bacon
was
as
much
astonished
by
it
as
the
church
was
and
with
reason
suddenly
society
felt
itself
dragged
into
situations
altogether
new
and
anarchic
situations
which
it
could
not
affect
but
which
painfully
affected
it
instinct
taught
it
that
the
universe
in
its
thought
must
be
in
danger
when
its
reflection
lost
itself
in
space
the
danger
was
all
the
greater
because
men
of
science
covered
it
with
larger
synthesis
and
poets
called
the
undevout
astronomer
mad
society
knew
better
yet
the
telescope
held
it
rigidly
standing
on
its
head
the
microscope
revealed
a
universe
that
defied
the
senses
gunpowder
killed
whole
races
that
lagged
behind
the
compass
coerced
the
most
imbruted
mariner
to
act
on
the
impossible
idea
that
the
earth
was
round
the
press
drenched
europe
with
anarchism
europe
saw
itself
violently
resisting
wrenched
into
false
positions
drawn
along
new
lines
as
a
fish
that
is
caught
on
a
hook
but
unable
to
understand
by
what
force
it
was
controlled
the
resistance
was
often
bloody
sometimes
humorous
always
constant
its
contortions
in
the
eighteenth
century
are
best
studied
in
the
wit
of
voltaire
but
all
history
and
all
philosophy
from
montaigne
and
pascal
to
schopenhauer
and
nietzsche
deal
with
nothing
else
and
still
throughout
it
all
the
baconian
law
held
good
thought
did
not
evolve
nature
but
nature
evolved
thought
not
one
considerable
man
of
science
dared
face
the
stream
of
thought
and
the
whole
number
of
those
who
acted
like
franklin
as
electric
conductors
of
the
new
forces
from
nature
to
man
down
to
the
year
did
not
exceed
a
few
score
confined
to
a
few
towns
in
western
europe
asia
refused
to
be
touched
by
the
stream
and
america
except
for
franklin
stood
outside
very
slowly
the
accretion
of
these
new
forces
chemical
and
mechanical
grew
in
volume
until
they
acquired
sufficient
mass
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
religious
science
substituting
their
attraction
for
the
attractions
of
the
civitas
dei
but
the
process
remained
the
same
nature
not
mind
did
the
work
that
the
sun
does
on
the
planets
man
depended
more
and
more
absolutely
on
forces
other
than
his
own
and
on
instruments
which
superseded
his
senses
bacon
foretold
it
neither
the
naked
hand
nor
the
understanding
left
to
itself
can
effect
much
it
is
by
instruments
and
helps
that
the
work
is
done
once
done
the
mind
resumed
its
illusion
and
society
forgot
its
impotence
but
no
one
better
than
bacon
knew
its
tricks
and
for
his
true
followers
science
always
meant
obedience
sensitiveness
to
impulse
from
without
non
fingendum
aut
excogitandum
sed
inveniendum
quid
natura
faciat
aut
ferat
the
success
of
this
method
staggers
belief
and
even
can
be
treated
by
history
only
as
a
miracle
of
growth
like
the
sports
of
nature
evidently
a
new
variety
of
mind
had
appeared
certain
men
merely
held
out
their
hands
like
newton
watched
an
apple
like
franklin
flew
a
kite
like
watt
played
with
a
and
great
forces
of
nature
stuck
to
them
as
though
she
were
playing
ball
governments
did
almost
nothing
but
resist
even
gunpowder
and
ordnance
the
great
weapon
of
government
showed
little
development
between
and
society
was
hostile
or
indifferent
as
priestley
and
jenner
and
even
fulton
with
reason
complained
in
the
most
advanced
societies
in
the
world
while
its
resistance
became
acute
wherever
the
church
held
control
until
all
mankind
seemed
to
draw
itself
out
in
a
long
series
of
groups
dragged
on
by
an
attractive
power
in
advance
which
even
the
leaders
obeyed
without
understanding
as
the
planets
obeyed
gravity
or
the
trees
obeyed
heat
and
light
the
influx
of
new
force
was
nearly
spontaneous
the
reaction
of
mind
on
the
mass
of
nature
seemed
not
greater
than
that
of
a
comet
on
the
sun
and
had
the
spontaneous
influx
of
force
stopped
in
europe
society
must
have
stood
still
or
gone
backward
as
in
asia
or
africa
then
only
economies
of
process
would
have
counted
as
new
force
and
society
would
have
been
better
pleased
for
the
idea
that
new
force
must
be
in
itself
a
good
is
only
an
animal
or
vegetable
instinct
as
nature
developed
her
hidden
energies
they
tended
to
become
destructive
thought
itself
became
tortured
suffering
reluctantly
impatiently
painfully
the
coercion
of
new
method
easy
thought
had
always
been
movement
of
inertia
and
mostly
mere
sentiment
but
even
the
processes
of
mathematics
measured
feebly
the
needs
of
force
the
stupendous
acceleration
after
ended
in
with
the
appearance
of
the
new
class
of
supersensual
forces
before
which
the
man
of
science
stood
at
first
as
bewildered
and
helpless
as
in
the
fourth
century
a
priest
of
isis
before
the
cross
of
christ
this
then
or
something
like
this
would
be
a
dynamic
formula
of
history
any
schoolboy
knows
enough
to
object
at
once
that
it
is
the
oldest
and
most
universal
of
all
theories
church
and
state
theology
and
philosophy
have
always
preached
it
differing
only
in
the
allotment
of
energy
between
nature
and
man
whether
the
attractive
energy
has
been
called
god
or
nature
the
mechanism
has
been
always
the
same
and
history
is
not
obliged
to
decide
whether
the
ultimate
tends
to
a
purpose
or
not
or
whether
ultimate
energy
is
one
or
many
every
one
admits
that
the
will
is
a
free
force
habitually
decided
by
motives
no
one
denies
that
motives
exist
adequate
to
decide
the
will
even
though
it
may
not
always
be
conscious
of
them
science
has
proved
that
forces
sensible
and
occult
physical
and
metaphysical
simple
and
complex
surround
traverse
vibrate
rotate
repel
attract
without
stop
that
man
senses
are
conscious
of
few
and
only
in
a
partial
degree
but
that
from
the
beginning
of
organic
existence
his
consciousness
has
been
induced
expanded
trained
in
the
lines
of
his
sensitiveness
and
that
the
rise
of
his
faculties
from
a
lower
power
to
a
higher
or
from
a
narrower
to
a
wider
field
may
be
due
to
the
function
of
assimilating
and
storing
outside
force
or
forces
there
is
nothing
unscientific
in
the
idea
that
beyond
the
lines
of
force
felt
by
the
senses
the
universe
may
be
as
it
has
always
been
either
a
supersensuous
chaos
or
a
divine
unity
which
irresistibly
attracts
and
is
either
life
or
death
to
penetrate
thus
far
religion
philosophy
and
science
seem
to
go
hand
in
hand
the
schools
begin
their
vital
battle
only
there
in
the
earlier
stages
of
progress
the
forces
to
be
assimilated
were
simple
and
easy
to
absorb
but
as
the
mind
of
man
enlarged
its
range
it
enlarged
the
field
of
complexity
and
must
continue
to
do
so
even
into
chaos
until
the
reservoirs
of
sensuous
or
supersensuous
energies
are
exhausted
or
cease
to
affect
him
or
until
he
succumbs
to
their
excess
for
past
history
this
way
of
grouping
its
sequences
may
answer
for
a
chart
of
relations
although
any
serious
student
would
need
to
invent
another
to
compare
or
correct
its
errors
but
past
history
is
only
a
value
of
relation
to
the
future
and
this
value
is
wholly
one
of
convenience
which
can
be
tested
only
by
experiment
any
law
of
movement
must
include
to
make
it
a
convenience
some
mechanical
formula
of
acceleration
chapter
xxxiv
a
law
of
acceleration
images
are
not
arguments
rarely
even
lead
to
proof
but
the
mind
craves
them
and
of
late
more
than
ever
the
keenest
experimenters
find
twenty
images
better
than
one
especially
if
contradictory
since
the
human
mind
has
already
learned
to
deal
in
contradictions
the
image
needed
here
is
that
of
a
new
centre
or
preponderating
mass
artificially
introduced
on
earth
in
the
midst
of
a
system
of
attractive
forces
that
previously
made
their
own
equilibrium
and
constantly
induced
to
accelerate
its
motion
till
it
shall
establish
a
new
equilibrium
a
dynamic
theory
would
begin
by
assuming
that
all
history
terrestrial
or
cosmic
mechanical
or
intellectual
would
be
reducible
to
this
formula
if
we
knew
the
facts
for
convenience
the
most
familiar
image
should
come
first
and
this
is
probably
that
of
the
comet
or
meteoric
streams
like
the
leonids
and
perseids
a
complex
of
minute
mechanical
agencies
reacting
within
and
without
and
guided
by
the
sum
of
forces
attracting
or
deflecting
it
nothing
forbids
one
to
assume
that
the
might
grow
as
an
acorn
does
absorbing
light
heat
electricity
or
thought
for
in
recent
times
such
transference
of
energy
has
become
a
familiar
idea
but
the
simplest
figure
at
first
is
that
of
a
perfect
comet
say
that
of
which
drops
from
space
in
a
straight
line
at
the
regular
acceleration
of
speed
directly
into
the
sun
and
after
wheeling
sharply
about
it
in
heat
that
ought
to
dissipate
any
known
substance
turns
back
unharmed
in
defiance
of
law
by
the
path
on
which
it
came
the
mind
by
analogy
may
figure
as
such
a
comet
the
better
because
it
also
defies
law
motion
is
the
ultimate
object
of
science
and
measures
of
motion
are
many
but
with
thought
as
with
matter
the
true
measure
is
mass
in
its
astronomic
sense
the
sum
or
difference
of
attractive
forces
science
has
quite
enough
trouble
in
measuring
its
material
motions
without
volunteering
help
to
the
historian
but
the
historian
needs
not
much
help
to
measure
some
kinds
of
social
movement
and
especially
in
the
nineteenth
century
society
by
common
accord
agreed
in
measuring
its
progress
by
the
the
ratio
of
increase
in
the
volume
of
may
serve
as
dynamometer
the
of
the
world
speaking
roughly
doubled
every
ten
years
between
and
in
the
form
of
utilized
power
for
the
ton
of
coal
yielded
three
or
four
times
as
much
power
in
as
in
rapid
as
this
rate
of
acceleration
in
volume
seems
it
may
be
tested
in
a
thousand
ways
without
greatly
reducing
it
perhaps
the
ocean
steamer
is
nearest
unity
and
easiest
to
measure
for
any
one
might
hire
in
for
a
small
sum
of
money
the
use
of
to
cross
the
ocean
and
by
halving
this
figure
every
ten
years
he
got
back
to
for
which
was
accuracy
enough
for
his
purposes
in
truth
his
chief
trouble
came
not
from
the
ratio
in
volume
of
heat
but
from
the
intensity
since
he
could
get
no
basis
for
a
ratio
there
all
ages
of
history
have
known
high
intensities
like
the
the
the
but
no
society
has
ever
used
high
intensities
on
any
large
scale
till
now
nor
can
a
mere
bystander
decide
what
range
of
temperature
is
now
in
common
use
loosely
guessing
that
science
controls
habitually
the
whole
range
from
absolute
zero
to
degrees
centigrade
one
might
assume
for
convenience
that
the
ratio
for
volume
could
be
used
temporarily
for
intensity
and
still
there
remained
a
ratio
to
be
guessed
for
other
forces
than
heat
since
scores
of
new
forces
had
been
discovered
old
forces
had
been
raised
to
higher
powers
as
could
be
measured
in
the
great
regions
of
chemistry
had
been
opened
up
and
connected
with
other
regions
of
physics
within
ten
years
a
new
universe
of
force
had
been
revealed
in
radiation
complexity
had
extended
itself
on
immense
horizons
and
arithmetical
ratios
were
useless
for
any
attempt
at
accuracy
the
force
evolved
seemed
more
like
explosion
than
gravitation
and
followed
closely
the
curve
of
steam
but
at
all
events
the
ratio
seemed
carefully
conservative
unless
the
calculator
was
prepared
to
be
instantly
overwhelmed
by
physical
force
and
mental
complexity
he
must
stop
there
thus
taking
the
year
as
the
starting
point
for
carrying
back
the
series
nothing
was
easier
than
to
assume
a
period
of
retardation
as
far
back
as
but
beyond
that
point
the
statistician
failed
and
only
the
mathematician
could
help
laplace
would
have
found
it
to
fix
a
ratio
of
progression
in
mathematical
science
between
descartes
leibnitz
newton
and
himself
watt
could
have
given
in
pounds
the
increase
of
power
between
newcomen
engines
and
his
own
volta
and
benjamin
franklin
would
have
stated
their
progress
as
absolute
creation
of
power
dalton
could
have
measured
minutely
his
advance
on
boerhaave
napoleon
i
must
have
had
a
distinct
notion
of
his
own
numerical
relation
to
louis
xiv
no
one
in
doubted
the
progress
of
force
least
of
all
those
who
were
to
lose
their
heads
by
it
pending
agreement
between
these
authorities
theory
may
assume
what
it
likes
say
a
fifty
or
even
a
period
of
reduplication
for
the
eighteenth
century
for
the
period
matters
little
until
the
acceleration
itself
is
admitted
the
subject
is
even
more
amusing
in
the
seventeenth
than
in
the
eighteenth
century
because
galileo
and
kepler
descartes
huygens
and
isaac
newton
took
vast
pains
to
fix
the
laws
of
acceleration
for
moving
bodies
while
lord
bacon
and
william
harvey
were
content
with
showing
experimentally
the
fact
of
acceleration
in
knowledge
but
from
their
combined
results
a
historian
might
be
tempted
to
maintain
a
similar
rate
of
movement
back
to
subject
to
correction
from
the
historians
of
mathematics
the
mathematicians
might
carry
their
calculations
back
as
far
as
the
fourteenth
century
when
algebra
seems
to
have
become
for
the
first
time
the
standard
measure
of
mechanical
progress
in
western
europe
for
not
only
copernicus
and
tycho
brahe
but
even
artists
like
leonardo
michael
angelo
and
albert
durer
worked
by
mathematical
processes
and
their
testimony
would
probably
give
results
more
exact
than
that
of
montaigne
or
shakespeare
but
to
save
trouble
one
might
tentatively
carry
back
the
same
ratio
of
acceleration
or
retardation
to
the
year
with
the
help
of
columbus
and
gutenberg
so
taking
a
uniform
rate
during
the
whole
four
centuries
and
leaving
to
statisticians
the
task
of
correcting
it
or
better
one
might
for
convenience
use
the
formula
of
squares
to
serve
for
a
law
of
mind
any
other
formula
would
do
as
well
either
of
chemical
explosion
or
electrolysis
or
vegetable
growth
or
of
expansion
or
contraction
in
innumerable
forms
but
this
happens
to
be
simple
and
convenient
its
force
increases
in
the
direct
ratio
of
its
squares
as
the
human
meteoroid
approached
the
sun
or
centre
of
attractive
force
the
attraction
of
one
century
squared
itself
to
give
the
measure
of
attraction
in
the
next
behind
the
year
the
process
certainly
went
on
but
the
progress
became
so
slight
as
to
be
hardly
measurable
what
was
gained
in
the
east
or
elsewhere
can
not
be
known
but
forces
called
loosely
greek
fire
and
gunpowder
came
into
use
in
the
west
in
the
thirteenth
century
as
well
as
instruments
like
the
compass
the
clocks
and
spectacles
and
materials
like
paper
arabic
notation
and
algebra
were
introduced
while
metaphysics
and
theology
acted
as
violent
stimulants
to
mind
an
architect
might
detect
a
sequence
between
the
church
of
peter
at
rome
the
amiens
cathedral
the
duomo
at
pisa
san
marco
at
venice
sancta
sofia
at
constantinople
and
the
churches
at
ravenna
all
the
historian
dares
affirm
is
that
a
sequence
is
manifestly
there
and
he
has
a
right
to
carry
back
his
ratio
to
represent
the
fact
without
assuming
its
numerical
correctness
on
the
human
mind
as
a
moving
body
the
break
in
acceleration
in
the
middle
ages
is
only
apparent
the
attraction
worked
through
shifting
forms
of
force
as
the
sun
works
by
light
or
heat
electricity
gravitation
or
what
not
on
different
organs
with
different
sensibilities
but
with
invariable
law
the
science
of
prehistoric
man
has
no
value
except
to
prove
that
the
law
went
back
into
indefinite
antiquity
a
stone
arrowhead
is
as
convincing
as
a
the
values
were
as
clear
a
hundred
thousand
years
ago
as
now
and
extended
equally
over
the
whole
world
the
motion
at
last
became
infinitely
slight
but
can
not
be
proved
to
have
stopped
the
motion
of
newton
comet
at
aphelion
may
be
equally
slight
to
evolutionists
may
be
left
the
processes
of
evolution
to
historians
the
single
interest
is
the
law
of
reaction
between
force
and
force
between
mind
and
nature
the
law
of
progress
the
great
division
of
history
into
phases
by
turgot
and
comte
first
affirmed
this
law
in
its
outlines
by
asserting
the
unity
of
progress
for
a
mere
phase
interrupts
no
growth
and
nature
shows
innumerable
such
phases
the
development
of
in
the
nineteenth
century
furnished
the
first
means
of
assigning
closer
values
to
the
elements
and
the
appearance
of
supersensual
forces
towards
made
this
calculation
a
pressing
necessity
since
the
next
step
became
infinitely
serious
a
law
of
acceleration
definite
and
constant
as
any
law
of
mechanics
can
not
be
supposed
to
relax
its
energy
to
suit
the
convenience
of
man
no
one
is
likely
to
suggest
a
theory
that
convenience
had
been
consulted
by
nature
at
any
time
or
that
nature
has
consulted
the
convenience
of
any
of
her
creations
except
perhaps
the
terebratula
in
every
age
man
has
bitterly
and
justly
complained
that
nature
hurried
and
hustled
him
for
inertia
almost
invariably
has
ended
in
tragedy
resistance
is
its
law
and
resistance
to
superior
mass
is
futile
and
fatal
fifty
years
ago
science
took
for
granted
that
the
rate
of
acceleration
could
not
last
the
world
forgets
quickly
but
even
today
the
habit
remains
of
founding
statistics
on
the
faith
that
consumption
will
continue
nearly
stationary
two
generations
with
john
stuart
mill
talked
of
this
stationary
period
which
was
to
follow
the
explosion
of
new
power
all
the
men
who
were
elderly
in
the
forties
died
in
this
faith
and
other
men
grew
old
nursing
the
same
conviction
and
happy
in
it
while
science
for
fifty
years
permitted
or
encouraged
society
to
think
that
force
would
prove
to
be
limited
in
supply
this
mental
inertia
of
science
lasted
through
the
eighties
before
showing
signs
of
breaking
up
and
nothing
short
of
radium
fairly
wakened
men
to
the
fact
long
since
evident
that
force
was
inexhaustible
even
then
the
scientific
authorities
vehemently
resisted
nothing
so
revolutionary
had
happened
since
the
year
thought
had
more
than
once
been
upset
but
never
caught
and
whirled
about
in
the
vortex
of
infinite
forces
power
leaped
from
every
atom
and
enough
of
it
to
supply
the
stellar
universe
showed
itself
running
to
waste
at
every
pore
of
matter
man
could
no
longer
hold
it
off
forces
grasped
his
wrists
and
flung
him
about
as
though
he
had
hold
of
a
live
wire
or
a
runaway
automobile
which
was
very
nearly
the
exact
truth
for
the
purposes
of
an
elderly
and
timid
single
gentleman
in
paris
who
never
drove
down
the
champs
elysees
without
expecting
an
accident
and
commonly
witnessing
one
or
found
himself
in
the
neighborhood
of
an
official
without
calculating
the
chances
of
a
bomb
so
long
as
the
rates
of
progress
held
good
these
bombs
would
double
in
force
and
number
every
ten
years
impossibilities
no
longer
stood
in
the
way
one
life
had
fattened
on
impossibilities
before
the
boy
was
six
years
old
he
had
seen
four
impossibilities
made
actual
the
the
railway
the
electric
telegraph
and
the
daguerreotype
nor
could
he
ever
learn
which
of
the
four
had
most
hurried
others
to
come
he
had
seen
the
of
the
united
states
grow
from
nothing
to
three
hundred
million
tons
or
more
what
was
far
more
serious
he
had
seen
the
number
of
minds
engaged
in
pursuing
force
the
truest
measure
of
its
attraction
increase
from
a
few
scores
or
hundreds
in
to
many
thousands
in
trained
to
sharpness
never
before
reached
and
armed
with
instruments
amounting
to
new
senses
of
indefinite
power
and
accuracy
while
they
chased
force
into
where
nature
herself
had
never
known
it
to
be
making
analyses
that
contradicted
being
and
syntheses
that
endangered
the
elements
no
one
could
say
that
the
social
mind
now
failed
to
respond
to
new
force
even
when
the
new
force
annoyed
it
horribly
every
day
nature
violently
revolted
causing
accidents
with
enormous
destruction
of
property
and
life
while
plainly
laughing
at
man
who
helplessly
groaned
and
shrieked
and
shuddered
but
never
for
a
single
instant
could
stop
the
railways
alone
approached
the
carnage
of
war
automobiles
and
ravaged
society
until
an
earthquake
became
almost
a
nervous
relaxation
an
immense
volume
of
force
had
detached
itself
from
the
unknown
universe
of
energy
while
still
vaster
reservoirs
supposed
to
be
infinite
steadily
revealed
themselves
attracting
mankind
with
more
compulsive
course
than
all
the
pontic
seas
or
gods
or
gold
that
ever
existed
and
feeling
still
less
of
retiring
ebb
in
science
would
have
smiled
at
such
a
romance
as
this
but
in
as
far
as
history
could
learn
few
men
of
science
thought
it
a
laughing
matter
if
a
perplexed
but
laborious
follower
could
venture
to
guess
their
drift
it
seemed
in
their
minds
a
between
anarchy
and
order
unless
they
should
be
more
honest
with
themselves
in
the
future
than
ever
they
were
in
the
past
they
would
be
more
astonished
than
their
followers
when
they
reached
the
end
if
karl
pearson
notions
of
the
universe
were
sound
men
like
galileo
descartes
leibnitz
and
newton
should
have
stopped
the
progress
of
science
before
supposing
them
to
have
been
honest
in
the
religious
convictions
they
expressed
in
they
were
plainly
forced
back
on
faith
in
a
unity
unproved
and
an
order
they
had
themselves
disproved
they
had
reduced
their
universe
to
a
series
of
relations
to
themselves
they
had
reduced
themselves
to
motion
in
a
universe
of
motions
with
an
acceleration
in
their
own
case
of
vertiginous
violence
with
the
correctness
of
their
science
history
had
no
right
to
meddle
since
their
science
now
lay
in
a
plane
where
scarcely
one
or
two
hundred
minds
in
the
world
could
follow
its
mathematical
processes
but
bombs
educate
vigorously
and
even
wireless
telegraphy
or
airships
might
require
the
reconstruction
of
society
if
any
analogy
whatever
existed
between
the
human
mind
on
one
side
and
the
laws
of
motion
on
the
other
the
mind
had
already
entered
a
field
of
attraction
so
violent
that
it
must
immediately
pass
beyond
into
new
equilibrium
like
the
comet
of
newton
to
suffer
dissipation
altogether
like
meteoroids
in
the
earth
atmosphere
if
it
behaved
like
an
explosive
it
must
rapidly
recover
equilibrium
if
it
behaved
like
a
vegetable
it
must
reach
its
limits
of
growth
and
even
if
it
acted
like
the
earlier
creations
of
energy
the
saurians
and
sharks
it
must
have
nearly
reached
the
limits
of
its
expansion
if
science
were
to
go
on
doubling
or
quadrupling
its
complexities
every
ten
years
even
mathematics
would
soon
succumb
an
average
mind
had
succumbed
already
in
it
could
no
longer
understand
the
problem
in
fortunately
a
student
of
history
had
no
responsibility
for
the
problem
he
took
it
as
science
gave
it
and
waited
only
to
be
taught
with
science
or
with
society
he
had
no
quarrel
and
claimed
no
share
of
authority
he
had
never
been
able
to
acquire
knowledge
still
less
to
impart
it
and
if
he
had
at
times
felt
serious
differences
with
the
american
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
felt
none
with
the
american
of
the
twentieth
for
this
new
creation
born
since
a
historian
asked
no
longer
to
be
teacher
or
even
friend
he
asked
only
to
be
a
pupil
and
promised
to
be
docile
for
once
even
though
trodden
under
foot
for
he
could
see
that
the
new
american
the
child
of
incalculable
chemical
power
electric
power
and
radiating
energy
as
well
as
of
new
forces
yet
undetermined
must
be
a
sort
of
god
compared
with
any
former
creation
of
nature
at
the
rate
of
progress
since
every
american
who
lived
into
the
year
would
know
how
to
control
unlimited
power
he
would
think
in
complexities
unimaginable
to
an
earlier
mind
he
would
deal
with
problems
altogether
beyond
the
range
of
earlier
society
to
him
the
nineteenth
century
would
stand
on
the
same
plane
with
the
fourth
equally
childlike
and
he
would
only
wonder
how
both
of
them
knowing
so
little
and
so
weak
in
force
should
have
done
so
much
perhaps
even
he
might
go
back
in
to
sit
with
gibbon
on
the
steps
of
ara
coeli
meanwhile
he
was
getting
education
with
that
a
teacher
who
had
failed
to
educate
even
the
generation
of
dared
not
interfere
the
new
forces
would
educate
history
saw
few
lessons
in
the
past
that
would
be
useful
in
the
future
but
one
at
least
it
did
see
the
attempt
of
the
american
of
to
educate
the
american
of
had
not
often
been
surpassed
for
folly
and
since
the
forces
and
their
complications
had
increased
a
thousand
times
or
more
the
attempt
of
the
american
of
to
educate
the
american
of
must
be
even
blinder
than
that
of
the
congressman
of
except
so
far
as
he
had
learned
his
ignorance
during
a
million
or
two
of
years
every
generation
in
turn
had
toiled
with
endless
agony
to
attain
and
apply
power
all
the
while
betraying
the
deepest
alarm
and
horror
at
the
power
they
created
the
teacher
of
if
foolhardy
might
stimulate
if
foolish
might
resist
if
intelligent
might
balance
as
wise
and
foolish
have
often
tried
to
do
from
the
beginning
but
the
forces
would
continue
to
educate
and
the
mind
would
continue
to
react
all
the
teacher
could
hope
was
to
teach
it
reaction
even
there
his
difficulty
was
extreme
the
most
elementary
books
of
science
betrayed
the
inadequacy
of
old
implements
of
thought
chapter
after
chapter
closed
with
phrases
such
as
one
never
met
in
older
literature
the
cause
of
this
phenomenon
is
not
understood
science
no
longer
ventures
to
explain
causes
the
first
step
towards
a
causal
explanation
still
remains
to
be
taken
opinions
are
very
much
divided
in
spite
of
the
contradictions
involved
science
gets
on
only
by
adopting
different
theories
sometimes
contradictory
evidently
the
new
american
would
need
to
think
in
contradictions
and
instead
of
kant
famous
four
antinomies
the
new
universe
would
know
no

could
not

its
to
educate
one
self
to
begin

been
the
effort
of
one
life
for
sixty
years
and
the
difficulties
of
education
had
gone
on
doubling
with
the
until
the
prospect
of
waiting
another
ten
years
in
order
to
face
a
seventh
doubling
of
complexities
allured
one
imagination
but
slightly
the
law
of
acceleration
was
definite
and
did
not
require
ten
years
more
study
except
to
show
whether
it
held
good
no
scheme
could
be
suggested
to
the
new
american
and
no
fault
needed
to
be
found
or
complaint
made
but
the
next
great
influx
of
new
forces
seemed
near
at
hand
and
its
style
of
education
promised
to
be
violently
coercive
the
movement
from
unity
into
multiplicity
between

unbroken
in
sequence
and
rapid

prolonged
one
generation
longer
it

a

social
mind
as
though

it
must
enter

to
new

thus
far
since
five
or
ten

xxxv
nunc
age
nearly
forty
years
had
passed
since
the
secretary
landed
at
new
york
with
the
adams
and
motley
when
they
saw
american
society
as
a
long
caravan
stretching
out
towards
the
plains
as
he
came
up
the
bay
again
november
an
older
man
than
either
his
father
or
motley
in
he
found
the
approach
more
striking
than
ever
wonderful
unlike
anything
man
had
ever
seen
and
like
nothing
he
had
ever
much
cared
to
see
the
outline
of
the
city
became
frantic
in
its
effort
to
explain
something
that
defied
meaning
power
seemed
to
have
outgrown
its
servitude
and
to
have
asserted
its
freedom
the
cylinder
had
exploded
and
thrown
great
masses
of
stone
and
steam
against
the
sky
the
city
had
the
air
and
movement
of
hysteria
and
the
citizens
were
crying
in
every
accent
of
anger
and
alarm
that
the
new
forces
must
at
any
cost
be
brought
under
control
prosperity
never
before
imagined
power
never
yet
wielded
by
man
speed
never
reached
by
anything
but
a
meteor
had
made
the
world
irritable
nervous
querulous
unreasonable
and
afraid
all
new
york
was
demanding
new
men
and
all
the
new
forces
condensed
into
corporations
were
demanding
a
new
type
of
man
a
man
with
ten
times
the
endurance
energy
will
and
mind
of
the
old
type
for
whom
they
were
ready
to
pay
millions
at
sight
as
one
jolted
over
the
pavements
or
read
the
last
week
newspapers
the
new
man
seemed
close
at
hand
for
the
old
one
had
plainly
reached
the
end
of
his
strength
and
his
failure
had
become
catastrophic
every
one
saw
it
and
every
municipal
election
shrieked
chaos
a
traveller
in
the
highways
of
history
looked
out
of
the
club
window
on
the
turmoil
of
fifth
avenue
and
felt
himself
in
rome
under
diocletian
witnessing
the
anarchy
conscious
of
the
compulsion
eager
for
the
solution
but
unable
to
conceive
whence
the
next
impulse
was
to
come
or
how
it
was
to
act
the
failure
of
christianity
roared
upward
from
broadway
and
no
constantine
the
great
was
in
sight
having
nothing
else
to
do
the
traveller
went
on
to
washington
to
wait
the
end
there
roosevelt
was
training
constantines
and
battling
trusts
with
the
battle
of
trusts
a
student
of
mechanics
felt
entire
sympathy
not
merely
as
a
matter
of
politics
or
society
but
also
as
a
measure
of
motion
the
trusts
and
corporations
stood
for
the
larger
part
of
the
new
power
that
had
been
created
since
and
were
obnoxious
because
of
their
vigorous
and
unscrupulous
energy
they
were
revolutionary
troubling
all
the
old
conventions
and
values
as
the
screws
of
ocean
steamers
must
trouble
a
school
of
herring
they
tore
society
to
pieces
and
trampled
it
under
foot
as
one
of
their
earliest
victims
a
citizen
of
quincy
born
in
had
learned
submission
and
silence
for
he
knew
that
under
the
laws
of
mechanics
any
change
within
the
range
of
the
forces
must
make
his
situation
only
worse
but
he
was
beyond
measure
curious
to
see
whether
the
conflict
of
forces
would
produce
the
new
man
since
no
other
energies
seemed
left
on
earth
to
breed
the
new
man
could
be
only
a
child
born
of
contact
between
the
new
and
the
old
energies
both
had
been
familiar
since
childhood
as
the
story
has
shown
and
neither
had
warped
the
umpire
judgment
by
its
favors
if
ever
judge
had
reason
to
be
impartial
it
was
he
the
sole
object
of
his
interest
and
sympathy
was
the
new
man
and
the
longer
one
watched
the
less
could
be
seen
of
him
of
the
forces
behind
the
trusts
one
could
see
something
they
owned
a
complete
organization
with
schools
training
wealth
and
purpose
but
of
the
forces
behind
roosevelt
one
knew
little
their
cohesion
was
slight
their
training
irregular
their
objects
vague
the
public
had
no
idea
what
practical
system
it
could
aim
at
or
what
sort
of
men
could
manage
it
the
single
problem
before
it
was
not
so
much
to
control
the
trusts
as
to
create
the
society
that
could
manage
the
trusts
the
new
american
must
be
either
the
child
of
the
new
forces
or
a
chance
sport
of
nature
the
attraction
of
mechanical
power
had
already
wrenched
the
american
mind
into
a
process
which
roosevelt
was
making
heroic
efforts
to
restore
to
even
action
and
he
had
every
right
to
active
support
and
sympathy
from
all
the
world
especially
from
the
trusts
themselves
so
far
as
they
were
human
but
the
doubt
persisted
whether
the
force
that
educated
was
really
man
or
nature
mind
or
motion
the
mechanical
theory
mostly
accepted
by
science
seemed
to
require
that
the
law
of
mass
should
rule
in
that
case
progress
would
continue
as
before
in
that
or
any
other
case
a
education
was
as
useless
or
misleading
as
an
education
had
been
to
the
child
of
but
adams
had
a
better
reason
for
holding
his
tongue
for
his
dynamic
theory
of
history
he
cared
no
more
than
for
the
kinetic
theory
of
gas
but
if
it
were
an
approach
to
measurement
of
motion
it
would
verify
or
disprove
itself
within
thirty
years
at
the
calculated
acceleration
the
head
of
the
must
very
soon
pass
perihelion
therefore
dispute
was
idle
discussion
was
futile
and
silence
next
to
was
the
mark
of
sense
if
the
acceleration
measured
by
the
development
and
economy
of
forces
were
to
continue
at
its
rate
since
the
mathematician
of
should
be
able
to
plot
the
past
and
future
orbit
of
the
human
race
as
accurately
as
that
of
the
november
meteoroids
naturally
such
an
attitude
annoyed
the
players
in
the
game
as
the
attitude
of
the
umpire
is
apt
to
infuriate
the
spectators
above
all
it
was
profoundly
unmoral
and
tended
to
discourage
effort
on
the
other
hand
it
tended
to
encourage
foresight
and
to
economize
waste
of
mind
if
it
was
not
itself
education
it
pointed
out
the
economies
necessary
for
the
education
of
the
new
american
there
the
duty
stopped
there
too
life
stopped
nature
has
educated
herself
to
a
singular
sympathy
for
death
on
the
antarctic
glacier
nearly
five
thousand
feet
above
captain
scott
found
carcasses
of
seals
where
the
animals
had
laboriously
flopped
up
to
die
in
peace
unless
we
had
actually
found
these
remains
it
would
have
been
past
believing
that
a
dying
seal
could
have
transported
itself
over
fifty
miles
of
rough
steep
but
the
seal
seems
often
to
crawl
to
the
shore
or
the
ice
to
die
probably
from
its
instinctive
dread
of
its
marine
enemies
in
india
purun
dass
at
the
end
of
statesmanship
sought
solitude
and
died
in
sanctity
among
the
deer
and
monkeys
rather
than
remain
with
man
even
in
america
the
indian
summer
of
life
should
be
a
little
sunny
and
a
little
sad
like
the
season
and
infinite
in
wealth
and
depth
of
tone
but
never
hustled
for
that
reason
one
own
passive
obscurity
seemed
sometimes
nearer
nature
than
john
hay
exposure
to
the
normal
animal
the
instinct
of
sport
is
innate
and
historians
themselves
were
not
exempt
from
the
passion
of
baiting
their
bears
but
in
its
turn
even
the
seal
dislikes
to
be
worried
to
death
in
age
by
creatures
that
have
not
the
strength
or
the
teeth
to
kill
him
outright
on
reaching
washington
november
adams
saw
at
a
glance
that
hay
must
have
rest
already
hay
had
bade
him
prepare
to
help
in
taking
her
husband
to
europe
as
soon
as
the
session
should
be
over
and
although
hay
protested
that
the
idea
could
not
even
be
discussed
his
strength
failed
so
rapidly
that
he
could
not
effectually
discuss
it
and
ended
by
yielding
without
struggle
he
would
equally
have
resigned
office
and
retired
like
purun
dass
had
not
the
president
and
the
press
protested
but
he
often
debated
the
subject
and
his
friends
could
throw
no
light
on
it
adams
himself
who
had
set
his
heart
on
seeing
hay
close
his
career
by
making
peace
in
the
east
could
only
urge
that
vanity
for
vanity
the
crown
of
peacemaker
was
worth
the
cross
of
martyrdom
but
the
cross
was
full
in
sight
while
the
crown
was
still
uncertain
adams
found
his
formula
for
russian
inertia
exasperatingly
correct
he
thought
that
russia
should
have
negotiated
instantly
on
the
fall
of
port
arthur
january
he
found
that
she
had
not
the
energy
but
meant
to
wait
till
her
navy
should
be
destroyed
the
delay
measured
precisely
the
time
that
hay
had
to
spare
the
close
of
the
session
on
march
left
him
barely
the
strength
to
crawl
on
board
ship
march
and
before
his
steamer
had
reached
half
her
course
he
had
revived
almost
as
gay
as
when
he
first
lighted
on
the
markoe
house
in
i
street
years
earlier
the
clouds
that
gather
round
the
setting
sun
do
not
always
take
a
sober
coloring
from
eyes
that
have
kept
watch
on
mortality
or
at
least
the
sobriety
is
sometimes
scarcely
sad
one
walks
with
one
friends
squarely
up
to
the
portal
of
life
and
bids
with
a
smile
one
has
done
it
so
often
hay
could
scarcely
pace
the
deck
he
nourished
no
illusions
he
was
convinced
that
he
should
never
return
to
his
work
and
he
talked
lightly
of
the
death
sentence
that
he
might
any
day
expect
but
he
threw
off
the
coloring
of
office
and
mortality
together
and
the
malaria
of
power
left
its
only
trace
in
the
sense
of
tasks
incomplete
one
could
honestly
help
him
there
laughing
frankly
at
his
dozen
treaties
hung
up
in
the
senate
like
lambs
in
a
butcher
shop
one
could
still
remind
him
of
what
was
solidly
completed
in
his
eight
years
of
office
he
had
solved
nearly
every
old
problem
of
american
statesmanship
and
had
left
little
or
nothing
to
annoy
his
successor
he
had
brought
the
great
atlantic
powers
into
a
working
system
and
even
russia
seemed
about
to
be
dragged
into
a
combine
of
intelligent
equilibrium
based
on
an
intelligent
allotment
of
activities
for
the
first
time
in
fifteen
hundred
years
a
true
roman
pax
was
in
sight
and
would
if
it
succeeded
owe
its
virtues
to
him
except
for
making
peace
in
manchuria
he
could
do
no
more
and
if
the
worst
should
happen
setting
continent
against
continent
in
arms
the
only
apparent
alternative
to
his
scheme
he
need
not
repine
at
missing
the
catastrophe
this
rosy
view
served
to
soothe
disgusts
which
every
parting
statesman
feels
and
commonly
with
reason
one
had
no
need
to
get
out
one
notebook
in
order
to
jot
down
the
exact
figures
on
either
side
why
add
up
the
elements
of
resistance
and
anarchy
the
kaiser
supplied
him
with
these
figures
just
as
the
cretic
approached
morocco
every
one
was
doing
it
and
seemed
in
a
panic
about
it
the
chaos
waited
only
for
his
landing
arrived
at
genoa
the
party
hid
itself
for
a
fortnight
at
nervi
and
he
gained
strength
rapidly
as
long
as
he
made
no
effort
and
heard
no
call
for
action
then
they
all
went
on
to
nanheim
without
relapse
there
after
a
few
days
adams
left
him
for
the
regular
treatment
and
came
up
to
paris
the
medical
reports
promised
well
and
hay
letters
were
as
humorous
and
as
ever
to
the
last
he
wrote
cheerfully
of
his
progress
and
amusingly
with
his
usual
light
scepticism
of
his
various
doctors
but
when
the
treatment
ended
three
weeks
later
and
he
came
on
to
paris
he
showed
at
the
first
glance
that
he
had
lost
strength
and
the
return
to
affairs
and
interviews
wore
him
rapidly
out
he
was
conscious
of
it
and
in
his
last
talk
before
starting
for
london
and
liverpool
he
took
the
end
of
his
activity
for
granted
you
must
hold
out
for
the
peace
negotiations
was
the
remonstrance
i
not
time
he
replied
you
need
little
time
was
the
rejoinder
each
was
correct
there
it
ended
shakespeare
himself
could
use
no
more
than
the
commonplace
to
express
what
is
incapable
of
expression
the
rest
is
silence
the
few
familiar
words
among
the
simplest
in
the
language
conveying
an
idea
trite
beyond
rivalry
served
shakespeare
and
as
yet
no
one
has
said
more
a
few
weeks
afterwards
one
warm
evening
in
early
july
as
adams
was
strolling
down
to
dine
under
the
trees
at
armenonville
he
learned
that
hay
was
dead
he
expected
it
on
account
he
was
even
satisfied
to
have
his
friend
die
as
we
would
all
die
if
we
could
in
full
fame
at
home
and
abroad
universally
regretted
and
wielding
his
power
to
the
last
one
had
seen
scores
of
emperors
and
heroes
fade
into
cheap
obscurity
even
when
alive
and
now
at
least
one
had
not
that
to
fear
for
one
friend
it
was
not
even
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
or
the
sense
of
void
that
threw
adams
into
the
depths
of
hamlet
shakespearean
silence
in
the
full
flare
of
paris
frivolity
in
its
favorite
haunt
where
worldly
vanity
reached
its
most
futile
climax
in
human
history
it
was
only
the
quiet
summons
to
follow
the
assent
to
dismissal
it
was
time
to
go
the
three
friends
had
begun
life
together
and
the
last
of
the
three
had
no
motive
no
attraction
to
carry
it
on
after
the
others
had
gone
education
had
ended
for
all
three
and
only
beyond
some
remoter
horizon
could
its
values
be
fixed
or
renewed
perhaps
some
day
say
their
centenary
they
might
be
allowed
to
return
together
for
a
holiday
to
see
the
mistakes
of
their
own
lives
made
clear
in
the
light
of
the
mistakes
of
their
successors
and
perhaps
then
for
the
first
time
since
man
began
his
education
among
the
carnivores
they
would
find
a
world
that
sensitive
and
timid
natures
could
regard
without
a
shudder
the
end
