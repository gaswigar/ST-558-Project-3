that

the
correspondence
old
scandals
concerning
the
private
life
of
lord
byron
have
been
revived
with
the
recent
publication
of
a
collection
of
his
letters
one
of
the
big
questions
seems
to
be
byron
send
mary
shelley
letter
to
everyone
seems
greatly
excited
about
it
lest
future
generations
be
thrown
into
turmoil
over
my
correspondence
after
i
am
gone
i
want
right
now
to
clear
up
the
mystery
which
has
puzzled
literary
circles
for
over
thirty
years
i
need
hardly
add
that
i
refer
to
what
is
known
as
the
correspondence
the
big
question
over
which
both
my
biographers
and
whittier
might
possibly
come
to
blows
is
this
as
i
understand
it
john
greenleaf
whittier
ever
receive
the
letters
i
wrote
to
him
in
the
late
fall
he
did
not
who
did
and
under
what
circumstances
were
they
i
was
a
very
young
man
at
the
time
and
whittier
was
naturally
very
old
there
had
been
a
meeting
of
the
club
in
old
dane
hall
now
demolished
in
cambridge
massachusetts
members
had
left
their
coats
and
hats
in
the
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
now
demolished
in
passing
out
after
a
rather
spirited
meeting
during
the
course
of
which
whittier
and
van
blarcom
had
opposed
each
other
rather
violently
over
the
question
of
baltimore
orioles
the
aged
poet
naturally
was
the
first
to
be
helped
into
his
coat
in
the
general
there
was
considerable
fooling
among
the
members
as
they
left
relieved
as
they
were
from
the
strain
of
the
meeting
whittier
was
given
my
hat
by
mistake
when
i
came
to
go
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
a
rather
seedy
gray
derby
with
a
black
band
containing
the
initials
as
the
poet
was
visiting
in
cambridge
at
the
time
i
took
opportunity
next
day
to
write
the
following
letter
to
him
cambridge
mass
november
dear
whittier
i
am
afraid
that
in
the
confusion
following
the
meeting
last
night
you
were
given
my
hat
by
mistake
i
have
yours
and
will
gladly
exchange
it
if
you
will
let
me
know
when
i
may
call
on
you
may
i
not
add
that
i
am
a
great
admirer
of
your
verse
have
you
ever
tried
any
musical
comedy
lyrics
i
think
that
i
could
get
you
in
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
show
game
as
i
know
a
young
man
who
has
written
several
songs
which
rice
has
said
he
would
like
to
use
in
his
next
comic
opera
provided
he
can
get
words
to
go
with
them
but
we
can
discuss
all
this
at
our
meeting
which
i
hope
will
be
soon
as
your
hat
looks
like
hell
on
me
yours
respectfully
robert
benchley
i
am
quite
sure
that
this
letter
was
mailed
as
i
find
an
entry
in
my
diary
of
that
date
which
reads
mailed
a
letter
to
whittier
cloudy
and
cooler
furthermore
in
a
confession
some
ten
years
later
one
mary
rourke
a
servant
employed
in
the
house
of
agassiz
with
whom
whittier
was
bunking
at
the
time
admitted
that
she
herself
had
taken
a
letter
bearing
my
name
in
the
corner
of
the
envelope
to
the
poet
at
his
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
but
whatever
became
of
it
after
it
fell
into
his
hands
i
received
no
reply
i
waited
five
days
during
which
time
i
stayed
in
the
house
rather
than
go
out
wearing
the
whittier
gray
derby
on
the
sixth
day
i
wrote
him
again
as
follows
cambridge
mass
dear
whittier
how
about
that
hat
of
mine
yours
respectfully
robert
benchley
i
received
no
answer
to
this
letter
either
concluding
that
the
good
gray
poet
was
either
too
busy
or
too
mean
to
bother
with
the
thing
i
myself
adopted
an
attitude
of
supercilious
unconcern
and
closed
the
correspondence
with
the
following
terse
message
cambridge
mass
december
dear
whittier
it
is
my
earnest
wish
that
the
hat
of
mine
which
you
are
keeping
will
slip
down
over
your
eyes
some
day
interfering
with
your
vision
to
such
an
extent
that
you
will
walk
off
the
sidewalk
into
the
gutter
and
receive
painful
albeit
superficial
injuries
your
young
friend
robert
benchley
here
the
matter
ended
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
and
i
trust
that
biographers
in
the
future
will
not
let
any
confusion
of
motives
or
misunderstanding
of
dates
enter
into
a
clear
and
unbiased
statement
of
the
whole
affair
we
must
not
have
another
scandal
ii
family
life
in
america
part
i
the
naturalistic
literature
of
this
country
has
reached
such
a
state
that
no
family
of
characters
is
considered
true
to
life
which
does
not
include
at
least
two
hypochondriacs
one
sadist
and
one
old
man
who
spills
food
down
the
front
of
his
vest
if
this
school
progresses
the
following
is
what
we
may
expect
in
our
national
literature
in
a
year
or
so
the
in
the
twillys
house
was
so
damp
that
thick
soppy
moss
grew
all
over
the
walls
it
dripped
on
the
picture
of
grandfather
twilly
that
hung
over
the
melodeon
making
streaks
down
the
dirty
glass
like
sweat
on
the
old
man
face
it
was
a
mean
face
grandfather
twilly
had
been
a
mean
man
and
had
little
spots
of
soup
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
all
his
children
were
mean
and
had
soup
spots
on
their
clothes
grandma
twilly
sat
in
the
rocker
over
by
the
window
and
as
she
rocked
the
chair
snapped
it
sounded
like
grandma
twilly
knees
snapping
as
they
did
whenever
she
stooped
over
to
pull
the
wings
off
a
fly
she
was
a
mean
old
thing
her
knuckles
were
grimy
and
she
chewed
crumbs
that
she
found
in
the
bottom
of
her
reticule
you
would
have
hated
her
she
hated
herself
but
most
of
all
she
hated
grandfather
twilly
i
certainly
hope
you
frying
good
she
muttered
as
she
looked
up
at
his
picture
has
the
undertaker
come
yet
ma
asked
young
wilbur
twilly
petulantly
she
was
boiling
water
on
the
and
every
now
and
again
would
spill
a
little
of
the
steaming
liquid
on
the
baby
who
was
playing
on
the
floor
she
hated
the
baby
because
it
looked
like
her
father
the
hot
water
raised
little
white
blisters
on
the
baby
red
neck
and
mabel
twilly
felt
short
sharp
twinges
of
pleasure
at
the
sight
it
was
the
only
pleasure
she
had
had
for
four
months
why
do
you
kill
yourself
ma
she
continued
you
only
in
the
way
here
and
you
know
it
it
just
because
you
a
mean
old
woman
and
want
to
make
trouble
for
us
that
you
hang
on
grandma
twilly
shot
a
dirty
look
at
her
she
had
always
hated
her
stringy
hair
mabel
had
dank
stringy
hair
grandma
twilly
thought
how
it
would
look
hanging
at
an
indian
belt
but
all
that
she
did
was
to
place
her
tongue
against
her
two
front
teeth
and
make
a
noise
like
the
faucet
wilbur
twilly
was
reading
the
paper
by
the
oil
lamp
wilbur
had
watery
blue
eyes
and
cigar
ashes
all
over
his
knees
the
third
and
fourth
buttons
of
his
vest
were
undone
it
was
too
hideous
he
was
conscious
of
his
family
seated
in
chairs
about
him
his
mother
chewing
crumbs
his
wife
mabel
with
her
stringy
hair
reading
his
sister
bernice
with
projecting
front
teeth
who
sat
thinking
of
the
man
who
came
every
day
to
take
away
the
waste
paper
bernice
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
her
family
would
discover
that
she
had
been
married
to
this
man
for
three
years
how
wilbur
hated
them
all
it
did
seem
as
if
he
could
stand
it
any
longer
he
wanted
to
scream
and
stick
pins
into
every
one
of
them
and
then
rush
out
and
see
the
girl
who
worked
in
his
office
snapping
all
day
he
hated
her
too
but
she
wore
part
the
street
was
covered
with
slimy
mud
it
oozed
out
from
under
rubbers
in
unpleasant
bubbles
until
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
must
kill
herself
hot
air
coming
out
from
a
steam
laundry
hot
stifling
air
bernice
did
work
in
the
laundry
but
she
wished
that
she
did
so
that
the
hot
air
would
kill
her
she
wanted
to
be
stifled
she
needed
torture
to
be
happy
she
also
needed
a
good
swift
clout
on
the
side
of
the
face
a
drunken
man
lurched
out
from
a
and
flung
his
arms
about
her
it
was
only
her
husband
she
loved
her
husband
she
loved
him
so
much
that
as
she
pushed
him
away
and
into
the
gutter
she
stuck
her
little
finger
into
his
eye
she
also
untied
his
it
was
a
bow
with
white
dirty
spots
on
it
and
it
was
wet
with
gin
it
did
seem
as
if
bernice
could
stand
it
any
longer
all
the
repressions
of
nineteen
sordid
years
behind
protruding
teeth
surged
through
her
untidy
soul
she
wanted
love
but
it
was
not
her
husband
that
she
loved
so
fiercely
it
was
old
grandfather
twilly
and
he
was
too
dead
part
in
the
of
the
twillys
house
everything
was
very
quiet
even
the
which
was
covered
with
grandma
twilly
lay
with
her
head
in
the
baked
potatoes
poisoned
by
mabel
who
in
her
turn
had
been
poisoned
by
her
husband
and
sprawled
in
an
odd
posture
over
the
wilbur
and
his
sister
bernice
had
just
finished
choking
each
other
to
death
and
between
them
completely
covered
the
carpet
in
that
corner
of
the
room
where
the
worn
spot
showed
the
bare
boards
beneath
like
ribs
on
a
chicken
carcass
only
the
baby
survived
she
had
a
mean
face
and
had
great
spillings
of
imperial
granum
down
her
bib
as
she
looked
about
her
at
her
family
a
great
hate
surged
through
her
tiny
body
and
her
eyes
snapped
viciously
she
wanted
to
get
down
from
her
and
show
them
all
how
much
she
hated
them
bernice
husband
the
man
who
came
after
the
waste
paper
staggered
into
the
room
the
tips
were
off
both
his
the
baby
experienced
a
voluptuous
sense
of
futility
at
the
sight
of
the
and
leered
suggestively
at
her
we
must
get
the
roof
fixed
said
the
man
very
quietly
it
lets
the
sun
in
iii
this
child
knows
the
answer
do
you
we
are
occasionally
confronted
in
the
advertisements
by
the
picture
of
an
offensively
little
boy
fairly
popping
with
information
who
it
is
claimed
in
the
text
knows
all
the
inside
dope
on
why
fog
forms
in
beads
on
a
woolen
coat
how
long
it
would
take
to
crawl
to
the
moon
on
your
hands
and
knees
and
what
makes
oysters
so
quiet
the
taunting
of
the
advertisement
is
this
child
knows
the
answer
do
you
and
the
idea
is
to
shame
you
into
buying
a
set
of
books
containing
answers
to
all
the
questions
in
the
world
except
the
question
where
is
the
money
coming
from
to
buy
the
books
any
little
boy
knowing
all
these
facts
would
unquestionably
be
an
asset
in
a
business
which
specialized
in
or
lunar
transportation
novelties
but
he
would
be
awful
to
have
about
the
house
spencer
you
might
say
to
him
where
are
daddy
slippers
to
which
he
would
undoubtedly
answer
i
do
know
dad
disagreeable
little
boys
like
that
always
call
their
fathers
dad
and
stand
with
their
feet
wide
apart
and
their
hands
in
their
pockets
like
girls
playing
rôles
on
the
stage
but
i
know
this
that
all
the
nordic
peoples
are
predisposed
to
astigmatism
because
of
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
snow
and
that
furthermore
if
you
were
to
place
a
common
ordinary
marble
in
a
glass
of
cider
there
would
be
a
precipitation
which
on
pouring
off
the
cider
would
be
found
to
be
what
we
know
as
parsley
just
plain
parsley
which
cook
uses
every
night
in
preparing
our
dinner
with
little
ones
like
this
around
the
house
a
new
version
of
the
children
hour
will
have
to
be
arranged
and
it
might
as
well
be
done
now
and
got
over
with
children
between
the
dark
and
the
when
the
night
is
beginning
lo
lower
comes
a
pause
in
the
day
occupation
which
is
known
as
the
children
hour
is
then
appears
tiny
irving
with
the
patter
of
little
feet
to
tell
us
that
worms
become
dizzy
at
a
slight
application
of
heat
and
norma
the
baby
savant
comes
toddling
up
with
the
news
that
a
valvular
catch
in
the

surprised
us
again
by

down

each

is
bursting
with
a
story

tell

iv
rules
and
suggestions
for
watching
auction
bridge
with
all
the
expert
advice
that
is
being
offered
in
print
these
days
about
how
to
play
games
it
seems
odd
that
no
one
has
formulated
a
set
of
rules
for
the
spectators
the
spectators
are
much
more
numerous
than
the
players
and
seem
to
need
more
regulation
as
a
spectator
of
twenty
years
standing
versed
in
watching
all
sports
except
bicycle
races
i
offer
the
fruit
of
my
experience
in
the
form
of
suggestions
and
reminiscences
which
may
tend
to
clarify
the
situation
or
in
case
there
is
no
situation
which
needs
clarifying
to
make
one
in
the
event
of
a
favorable
reaction
on
the
part
of
the
public
i
shall
form
an
association
to
be
known
as
the
national
amateur
audience
association
or
the
if
you
are
given
to
slang
of
which
i
shall
be
treasurer
that
all
i
ask
the
treasurership
this
being
an
of
the
year
for
outdoor
sports
except
walking
which
is
getting
to
have
neither
participants
nor
spectators
it
seems
best
to
start
with
a
few
remarks
on
the
strenuous
occupation
of
watching
a
bridge
game
are
not
so
numerous
as
football
watchers
for
instance
but
they
are
much
more
in
need
of
coordination
and
it
will
be
the
aim
of
this
article
to
formulate
a
standardized
set
of
rules
for
watching
bridge
which
may
be
taken
as
a
criterion
for
the
whole
country
number
who
may
watch
there
should
not
be
more
than
one
watcher
for
each
table
when
there
are
two
or
more
confusion
is
apt
to
result
and
no
one
of
the
watchers
can
devote
his
attention
to
the
game
as
it
should
be
devoted
two
watchers
are
also
likely
to
bump
into
each
other
as
they
make
their
way
around
the
table
looking
over
the
players
shoulders
if
there
are
more
watchers
than
there
are
tables
two
can
share
one
table
between
them
one
being
dummy
while
the
other
watches
in
this
event
the
first
one
should
watch
until
the
hand
has
been
dealt
and
six
tricks
taken
being
relieved
by
the
second
one
for
the
remaining
tricks
and
the
marking
down
of
the
score
preliminaries
in
order
to
avoid
any
charge
of
signalling
it
will
be
well
for
the
following
conversational
formula
to
be
used
before
the
game
begins
the
of
the
game
says
to
the
fifth
person
wo
you
join
the
game
and
make
a
fourth
i
have
some
work
which
i
really
ought
to
be
doing
the
fifth
person
replies
oh
no
thank
you
i
play
a
wretched
game
i
much
rather
sit
here
and
read
if
you
do
mind
to
which
the
replies
pray
do
after
the
first
hand
has
been
dealt
the
fifth
person
whom
we
shall
now
call
the
watcher
puts
down
the
book
and
leans
forward
in
his
or
her
chair
craning
the
neck
to
see
what
is
in
the
hand
nearest
him
the
strain
becoming
too
great
he
arises
and
approaches
the
table
saying
do
you
mind
if
i
watch
a
bit
no
answer
need
be
given
to
this
unless
someone
at
the
table
has
nerve
enough
to
tell
the
truth
procedure
the
game
is
now
on
the
watcher
walks
around
the
table
giving
each
hand
a
careful
scrutiny
groaning
slightly
at
the
sight
of
a
poor
one
and
making
noises
of
joyful
anticipation
at
the
good
ones
stopping
behind
an
especially
unpromising
array
of
cards
it
is
well
to
say
well
unlucky
at
cards
lucky
in
love
you
know
this
gives
the
partner
an
opportunity
to
judge
his
chances
on
the
bid
he
is
about
to
make
and
is
perfectly
fair
to
the
other
side
too
for
they
are
not
left
entirely
in
the
dark
thus
everyone
benefits
by
the
remark
illustration
the
watcher
walks
around
the
table
giving
each
hand
a
careful
scrutiny
when
the
bidding
begins
the
watcher
has
considerable
opportunity
for
effective
work
having
seen
how
the
cards
lie
he
is
able
to
stand
back
and
listen
with
a
knowing
expression
laughing
at
unjustified
bids
and
urging
on
those
who
should
in
his
estimation
plunge
at
the
conclusion
of
the
bidding
he
should
say
well
we
off
as
the
hand
progresses
and
the
players
become
intent
on
the
game
the
watcher
may
be
the
cause
of
no
little
innocent
diversion
he
may
ask
one
of
the
players
for
a
match
or
standing
behind
the
one
who
is
playing
the
hand
he
may
say
i
give
you
three
guesses
as
to
whom
i
ran
into
on
the
street
yesterday
someone
you
all
know
used
to
go
to
school
with
you
harry
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
medium
build
well
sir
it
was
lew
milliken
yessir
lew
milliken
had
seen
him
for
fifteen
years
asked
after
you
harry
and
george
too
and
what
do
you
think
he
told
me
about
chick
answers
may
or
may
not
be
returned
to
these
remarks
according
to
the
good
nature
of
the
players
but
in
any
event
they
serve
their
purpose
of
distraction
particular
care
should
be
taken
that
no
one
of
the
players
is
allowed
to
make
a
mistake
the
watcher
having
his
mind
free
is
naturally
in
a
better
position
to
keep
track
of
matters
of
sequence
and
revoking
thus
he
may
say
the
lead
was
over
here
george
or
i
think
that
you
refused
spades
a
few
hands
ago
lillian
of
course
there
are
some
watchers
who
have
an
inherited
delicacy
about
offering
advice
or
talking
to
the
players
some
people
are
that
way
they
are
interested
in
the
game
and
love
to
watch
but
they
feel
that
they
ought
not
to
interfere
i
had
a
cousin
who
just
would
talk
while
a
hand
was
being
played
and
so
as
she
had
to
do
something
she
hummed
she
did
hum
very
well
and
her
program
was
limited
to
the
first
two
lines
of
how
firm
a
foundation
but
she
carried
it
off
very
well
and
often
got
the
players
to
humming
it
along
with
her
she
could
also
drum
rather
well
with
her
fingers
on
the
back
of
the
chair
of
one
of
the
players
while
looking
over
his
shoulder
how
firm
a
foundation
lend
itself
very
well
to
drumming
so
she
had
a
little
patrol
that
she
worked
up
all
by
herself
beginning
soft
like
a
drum
corps
in
the
distance
and
getting
louder
and
louder
finally
dying
away
again
so
that
you
could
barely
near
it
it
was
wonderful
how
she
could
do
it
and
still
go
on
living
those
who
feel
this
way
about
talking
while
others
are
playing
bridge
have
a
great
advantage
over
my
cousin
and
her
class
if
they
can
play
the
piano
they
play
ever
so
softly
in
order
not
to
disturb
but
somehow
or
other
you
just
know
that
they
are
there
and
that
the
next
to
last
note
in
the
coda
is
going
to
be
very
sour
but
of
course
the
piano
work
does
not
technically
come
under
the
head
of
watching
although
when
there
are
two
watchers
to
a
table
one
may
go
over
to
the
piano
while
she
is
dummy
but
your
real
watcher
will
allow
nothing
to
interfere
with
his
conscientious
following
of
the
game
and
it
is
for
real
watchers
only
that
these
suggestions
have
been
formulated
the
minute
you
get
out
of
the
class
of
those
who
have
the
best
interests
of
the
game
at
heart
you
become
involved
in
dilettantism
and
amateurishness
and
the
whole
sport
of
falls
into
disrepute
the
only
trouble
with
the
game
as
it
now
stands
is
the
risk
of
personal
injury
this
can
be
eliminated
by
the
watcher
insisting
on
each
player
being
frisked
for
weapons
before
the
game
begins
and
cultivating
a
good
serviceable
defense
against
ordinary
forms
of
fistic
attack
v
a
christmas
spectacle
use
in
christmas
eve
entertainments
in
the
at
the
opening
of
the
entertainment
the
superintendent
will
step
into
the
footlights
recover
his
balance
apologetically
and
say
boys
and
girls
of
the
intermediate
department
parents
and
friends
i
suppose
you
all
know
why
we
are
here
tonight
at
this
point
the
audience
will
titter
apprehensively
drury
and
her
class
of
little
girls
have
been
working
very
hard
to
make
this
entertainment
a
success
and
i
am
sure
that
everyone
here
is
going
to
have
what
i
overheard
one
of
my
boys
the
other
day
calling
good
time
indulgent
laughter
from
the
little
boys
and
may
i
add
before
the
curtain
goes
up
that
immediately
after
the
entertainment
we
want
you
all
to
file
out
into
the
christian
endeavor
room
where
there
will
be
a
christmas
tree
all
the
fixin
as
the
boys
say
shrill
whistling
from
the
little
boys
and
immoderate
applause
from
everyone
there
will
then
be
a
wait
of
minutes
while
sounds
of
hammering
and
dropping
may
be
heard
from
behind
the
curtains
the
club
orchestra
will
render
the
poet
and
peasant
overture
four
times
in
succession
each
time
differently
at
last
one
side
of
the
curtains
will
be
drawn
back
the
other
will
catch
on
something
and
have
to
be
released
by
hand
someone
will
whisper
loudly
put
out
the
lights
following
which
the
entire
house
will
be
plunged
into
darkness
amid
catcalls
from
the
little
boys
the
footlights
will
at
last
go
on
disclosing
the
windows
in
the
rear
of
the
vestry
rather
ineffectively
concealed
by
a
group
of
small
fir
trees
on
standards
one
of
which
has
already
fallen
over
leaving
exposed
a
corner
of
the
map
of
palestine
and
the
list
of
classes
for
november
in
the
center
of
the
stage
is
a
larger
tree
undecorated
while
at
the
extreme
left
invisible
to
everyone
in
the
audience
except
those
sitting
at
the
extreme
right
is
an
imitation
fireplace
leaning
against
the
wall
seconds
too
early
little
flora
rochester
will
prance
out
from
the
wings
uttering
the
first
shrill
notes
of
a
song
and
will
have
to
be
grabbed
by
eager
hands
and
pulled
back
seconds
later
the
piano
will
begin
the
return
of
the
reindeer
with
a
powerful
accent
on
the
first
note
of
each
bar
and
flora
rochester
lillian
mcnulty
gertrude
hamingham
and
martha
wrist
will
swirl
on
dressed
in
white
and
advance
heavily
into
the
footlights
which
will
go
out
there
will
then
be
an
interlude
while
neff
the
sexton
adjusts
the
connection
during
which
the
four
little
girls
stand
undecided
whether
to
brave
it
out
or
cry
as
a
compromise
they
giggle
and
are
herded
back
into
the
wings
by
drury
amid
applause
when
the
lights
go
on
again
the
applause
becomes
deafening
and
as
neff
walks
triumphantly
away
the
little
boys
in
the
audience
will
whistle
there
she
goes
there
she
goes
all
dressed
up
in
her
sunday
clothes
the
return
of
the
reindeer
will
be
started
again
and
the
will
reappear
this
time
more
gingerly
and
somewhat
dispirited
they
will
however
sing
the
following
to
the
music
of
the
ballet
pizzicato
from
sylvia
we
greet
you
we
greet
you
on
this
christmas
eve
so
fine
we
greet
you
we
greet
you
and
wish
you
a
good
time
they
will
then
turn
toward
the
tree
and
flora
rochester
will
advance
hanging
a
silver
star
on
one
of
the
branches
meanwhile
reciting
a
verse
the
only
distinguishable
words
of
which
are
am
faith
so
strong
and
at
the
conclusion
of
her
recitation
the
star
will
fall
off
lillian
mcnulty
will
then
step
forward
and
hang
her
star
on
a
branch
reading
her
lines
in
clear
tones
i
am
hope
a
virtue
great
my
gift
to
christmas
now
i
make
that
children
and
may
hope
today
that
tomorrow
will
be
a
merry
christmas
the
hanging
of
the
third
star
will
be
consummated
by
gertrude
hamingham
who
will
get
as
far
as
charity
i
bring
to
place
upon
the
at
which
point
the
strain
will
become
too
great
and
she
will
forget
the
remainder
after
several
frantic
glances
toward
the
wings
from
which
drury
is
sending
out
whispered
messages
to
the
effect
that
the
next
line
begins
message
gertrude
will
disappear
crying
softly
illustration
and
the
tree
i
go
after
the
morale
of
the
cast
has
been
in
some
measure
restored
by
the
pianist
who
with
great
presence
of
mind
plays
a
few
bars
of
will
there
be
any
stars
in
my
crown
to
cover
up
gertrude
exit
martha
wrist
will
unleash
a
rope
of
silver
tinsel
from
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
stringing
it
over
the
boughs
as
she
skips
around
in
a
circle
will
say
with
great
assurance
and
the
tree
i
go
through
the
holly
and
the
snow
bringing
love
and
christmas
cheer
through
the
happy
year
to
at
this
point
there
will
be
a
great
commotion
and
jangling
of
and
creamer
rather
poorly
disguised
as
santa
claus
will
emerge
from
the
opening
in
the
imitation
a
great
popular
demonstration
for
creamer
will
follow
he
will
then
advance
to
the
footlights
and
rubbing
his
pillow
and
ducking
his
knees
to
denote
joviality
will
say
thickly
through
his
false
beard
well
well
well
what
have
we
here
a
lot
of
bad
little
boys
and
girls
who
are
going
to
get
any
christmas
presents
this
year
nervous
laughter
from
the
little
boys
and
girls
let
me
see
let
me
see
i
have
a
note
here
from
whidden
let
see
what
it
says
reads
from
a
paper
on
which
there
is
obviously
nothing
written
you
and
the
young
people
of
the
intermediate
department
will
come
into
the
christian
endeavor
room
i
think
we
may
have
a
little
surprise
for
you
well
well
well
what
do
you
suppose
it
can
be
cries
of
i
know
i
know
from
sophisticated
ones
in
the
audience
maybe
it
is
a
bottle
of
raucous
jeers
from
the
little
boys
and
elaborately
simulated
disgust
on
the
part
of
the
little
girls
well
anyway
suppose
we
go
out
and
see
now
if
miss
liftnagle
will
oblige
us
with
a
little
march
on
the
piano
we
will
all
form
in
single
file
at
this
point
there
will
ensue
a
stampede
toward
the
christian
endeavor
room
in
which
chairs
will
be
broken
decorations
demolished
and
the
protesting
creamer
badly
hurt
this
will
bring
to
a
close
the
first
part
of
the
entertainment
vi
how
to
watch
a
second
in
the
list
of
games
which
it
is
necessary
for
every
sportsman
to
know
how
to
watch
comes
chess
if
you
do
know
how
to
watch
chess
the
chances
are
that
you
will
never
have
any
connection
with
the
game
whatsoever
you
would
not
by
any
chance
be
playing
it
yourself
i
know
some
very
nice
people
that
play
chess
mind
you
and
i
have
thought
that
i
was
in
any
way
spoofing
at
the
game
i
would
sooner
spoof
at
the
people
who
engineered
the
panama
canal
or
who
are
drawing
up
plans
for
the
vehicular
tunnel
under
the
hudson
river
i
am
no
man
to
make
light
of
chess
and
its
adherents
although
they
might
very
well
make
light
of
me
in
fact
they
have
but
what
i
say
is
that
taking
society
by
and
large
man
and
boy
the
chances
are
that
chess
would
be
the
party
among
the
contestants
for
sporting
honors
now
since
it
is
settled
that
you
probably
will
not
want
to
play
chess
unless
you
should
be
laid
up
with
a
bad
or
something
it
follows
that
if
you
want
to
know
anything
about
the
sport
at
all
you
will
have
to
watch
it
from
the
that
is
what
this
series
of
lessons
aims
to
teach
you
to
do
of
course
if
you
are
going
to
be
nasty
and
say
that
you
do
want
even
to
watch
it
why
all
this
time
has
been
wasted
on
my
part
as
well
as
on
yours
how
to
find
a
game
to
watch
the
first
problem
confronting
the
chess
spectator
is
to
find
some
people
who
are
playing
the
bigger
the
city
the
harder
it
is
to
find
anyone
indulging
in
chess
in
a
small
town
you
can
usually
go
straight
to
wilbur
tatnuck
general
store
and
be
fairly
sure
of
finding
a
quiet
game
in
progress
over
behind
the
stove
and
the
crate
of
but
as
you
draw
away
from
the
mitten
district
you
find
the
sporting
instinct
of
the
population
cropping
out
in
other
lines
and
chess
becoming
more
and
more
restricted
to
the
sheltered
corners
of
and
exclusive
social
organizations
however
we
shall
have
to
suppose
in
order
to
get
any
article
written
at
all
that
you
have
found
two
people
playing
chess
somewhere
they
probably
will
neither
see
nor
hear
you
as
you
come
up
on
them
so
you
can
stand
directly
behind
the
one
who
is
defending
the
south
goal
without
fear
of
detection
the
details
of
the
game
at
first
you
may
think
that
they
are
both
dead
but
a
mirror
held
to
the
lips
of
the
nearest
contestant
will
probably
show
moisture
unless
of
course
they
really
should
be
dead
which
would
be
a
horrible
ending
for
a
little
lark
like
this
i
once
heard
of
a
murderer
who
propped
his
two
victims
up
against
a
chess
board
in
sporting
attitudes
and
was
able
to
get
as
far
as
seattle
before
his
crime
was
discovered
soon
you
will
observe
a
slight
twitching
of
an
or
a
moistening
of
the
lips
and
then
like
a
greatly
retarded
of
a
person
passing
the
salt
one
of
the
players
will
lift
a
from
one
spot
on
the
board
and
place
it
on
another
spot
it
would
be
best
not
to
stand
too
close
to
the
board
at
this
time
as
you
are
are
likely
to
be
trampled
on
in
the
excitement
for
this
action
that
you
have
just
witnessed
corresponds
to
a
run
around
right
end
in
a
football
game
or
a
in
baseball
and
is
likely
to
cause
considerable
enthusiasm
on
the
one
hand
and
deep
depression
on
the
other
they
may
even
forget
themselves
to
the
point
of
shifting
their
feet
or
changing
the
hands
on
which
they
are
resting
their
foreheads
almost
anything
is
liable
to
happen
when
the
commotion
has
died
down
a
little
it
will
be
safe
for
you
to
walk
around
and
stand
behind
the
other
player
and
wait
there
for
the
next
move
while
waiting
it
would
be
best
to
stand
with
the
weight
of
your
body
evenly
distributed
between
your
two
feet
for
you
will
probably
be
standing
there
a
long
time
and
if
you
bear
down
on
one
foot
all
of
the
time
that
foot
is
bound
to
get
tired
a
comfortable
stance
for
watching
chess
is
with
the
feet
slightly
apart
perhaps
a
foot
or
a
foot
and
a
half
with
a
slight
bend
at
the
knees
to
rest
the
legs
and
the
weight
of
the
body
thrown
forward
on
the
balls
of
the
feet
a
rhythmic
rising
on
the
toes
holding
the
hands
behind
the
back
the
head
well
up
and
the
chest
out
introduces
a
note
of
variety
into
the
position
which
will
be
welcome
along
about
dusk
not
knowing
anything
about
the
game
you
will
perhaps
find
it
difficult
at
first
to
keep
your
attention
on
the
board
this
can
be
accomplished
by
means
of
several
little
optical
tricks
for
instance
if
you
look
at
the
black
and
white
squares
on
the
board
very
hard
and
for
a
very
long
time
they
will
appear
to
jump
about
and
change
places
the
black
squares
will
rise
from
the
board
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
slightly
overlap
the
white
ones
then
if
you
change
focus
suddenly
the
white
squares
will
do
the
same
thing
to
the
black
ones
and
finally
after
doing
this
until
someone
asks
you
what
you
are
looking
for
if
you
will
shut
your
eyes
tight
you
will
see
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
done
in
pink
and
green
in
your
mind
eye
by
this
time
the
players
will
be
almost
ready
for
another
move
this
will
make
two
moves
that
you
have
watched
it
is
now
time
to
get
a
little
fancy
work
into
your
game
about
an
hour
will
have
already
gone
by
and
you
should
be
so
thoroughly
grounded
in
the
fundamentals
of
chess
watching
that
you
can
proceed
to
the
next
step
have
some
one
of
your
friends
bring
you
a
chair
a
table
and
an
old
pyrography
outfit
together
with
some
on
which
to
burn
a
design
seat
yourself
at
the
table
in
the
chair
and
if
i
remember
the
process
correctly
squeeze
the
bulb
attached
to
the
needle
until
the
latter
becomes
red
hot
then
grasping
the
in
the
left
hand
carefully
trace
around
the
pencilled
design
with
the
point
of
the
needle
it
probably
will
be
a
picture
of
the
lion
of
lucerne
and
you
will
let
the
needle
slip
on
the
way
round
the
face
giving
it
the
appearance
of
having
shaved
in
a
pullman
that
morning
but
that
really
wo
make
any
difference
for
the
whole
thing
is
not
so
much
to
do
a
nice
pair
of
as
to
help
you
along
in
watching
the
if
you
have
any
scruples
against
burning
wood
you
may
knit
something
or
paste
stamps
in
an
album
and
before
you
know
it
the
game
will
be
over
and
you
can
put
on
your
things
and
go
home
vii
watching
baseball
news
eighteen
men
play
a
game
of
baseball
and
eighteen
thousand
watch
them
and
yet
those
who
play
are
the
only
ones
who
have
any
official
direction
in
the
matter
of
rules
and
regulations
the
eighteen
thousand
are
allowed
to
run
wild
they
do
have
even
a
spalding
guide
containing
group
photographs
of
model
organizations
of
fans
in
fall
river
or
the
junior
rooters
of
lyons
nebraska
whatever
course
of
behavior
a
fan
follows
at
a
game
he
makes
up
for
himself
this
is
of
course
ridiculous
the
first
set
of
official
rulings
for
spectators
at
baseball
games
has
been
formulated
and
is
herewith
reproduced
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
in
the
general
cleanup
which
the
game
is
undergoing
the
grandstand
and
bleachers
will
not
resent
a
little
dictation
from
the
authorities
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
question
of
shouting
encouragement
or
otherwise
at
the
players
there
must
be
no
more
random
screaming
it
is
of
course
understood
that
the
players
are
entirely
dependent
on
the
advice
offered
them
from
the
stands
for
their
actions
in
the
game
and
how
is
a
batter
to
know
what
to
do
if
for
instance
he
hears
a
little
man
in
the
bleachers
shouting
wait
for
wally
wait
for
and
another
little
man
in
the
south
stand
shouting
take
a
crack
at
the
first
one
wally
what
would
you
do
what
would
lincoln
have
done
the
official
advisers
in
the
stands
must
work
together
they
must
remember
that
as
the
batter
advances
toward
the
plate
he
is
listening
for
them
to
give
him
his
instructions
and
if
he
hears
conflicting
advice
there
is
no
telling
what
he
may
do
he
may
even
have
to
decide
for
himself
therefore
before
each
player
goes
to
bat
there
should
be
a
conference
among
the
fans
who
have
ideas
on
what
his
course
of
action
should
be
and
as
soon
as
a
majority
have
come
to
a
decision
the
advice
should
be
shouted
to
the
player
in
unison
under
the
direction
of
a
if
there
are
any
dissenting
opinions
they
may
be
expressed
in
a
minority
report
in
the
matter
of
hostile
remarks
addressed
at
an
unpopular
player
on
the
visiting
team
it
would
probably
be
better
to
leave
the
wording
entirely
to
the
individual
fans
each
man
has
his
own
talents
in
this
sort
of
thing
and
should
be
allowed
to
develop
them
along
natural
lines
in
such
crises
as
these
in
which
it
becomes
necessary
to
rattle
the
opposing
pitcher
or
prevent
the
visiting
catcher
from
getting
a
difficult
foul
all
considerations
of
good
sportsmanship
should
be
discarded
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
doubtful
if
good
sportsmanship
should
ever
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
fan
participation
in
a
contest
the
game
must
be
kept
free
from
all
softening
influences
one
of
the
chief
duties
of
the
fan
is
to
engage
in
arguments
with
the
man
behind
him
this
department
of
the
game
has
been
allowed
to
run
down
fearfully
a
great
many
men
go
to
a
ball
game
today
and
never
speak
a
word
to
anyone
other
than
the
members
of
their
own
party
or
an
occasional
word
of
cheer
to
a
player
this
is
nothing
short
of
craven
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
should
go
to
a
game
prepared
to
take
offense
no
matter
what
happens
he
should
be
equipped
with
a
stock
of
ready
sallies
which
can
be
used
regardless
of
what
the
argument
is
about
or
what
has
gone
before
in
the
exchange
of
words
among
the
more
popular
nuggets
of
repartee
effective
on
all
occasions
are
the
following
oh
is
that
so
eah
how
do
you
get
that
way
oh
is
that
so
so
are
you
aw
go
have
your
hair
bobbed
oh
is
that
so
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
who
says
so
eah
well
i
cincinnati
you
oh
is
that
so
any
one
of
these
if
hurled
with
sufficient
venom
is
good
for
ten
points
and
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
is
no
danger
of
physical
harm
resulting
from
even
the
most
argument
statistics
gathered
by
the
war
department
show
that
the
percentage
of
actual
blows
struck
in
grandstand
arguments
is
one
in
every
for
those
fans
who
are
occasionally
obliged
to
take
inexperienced
to
a
game
a
special
set
of
rules
has
been
drawn
up
these
include
the
compulsory
purchase
of
tickets
in
what
is
called
the
explaining
section
a
block
of
seats
set
aside
by
the
management
for
the
purpose
the
view
of
the
diamond
from
this
section
is
not
very
good
but
it
does
matter
as
the
men
would
see
anything
of
the
game
anyway
and
the
women
can
see
just
enough
to
give
them
material
for
questions
and
to
whet
their
curiosity
as
everyone
around
you
is
answering
questions
and
trying
to
explain
there
is
not
the
embarrassment
which
is
usually
attendant
on
being
overheard
by
unattached
fans
in
the
vicinity
there
is
also
not
the
distracting
sound
of
breaking
pencils
and
modified
cursing
to
interfere
with
unattached
fans
enjoyment
of
the
game
absolutely
no
gentlemen
with
uninformed
ladies
will
be
admitted
to
the
main
stand
in
order
to
enforce
this
regulation
a
short
examination
on
the
rudiments
of
the
game
will
take
place
at
the
gate
in
which
ladies
will
be
expected
to
answer
briefly
the
following
questions
women
examiners
will
be
in
attendance
what
game
is
it
that
is
being
played
on
this
field
how
many
games
have
you
seen
before
what
is
a
a
pitcher
b
a
base
c
a
bat
what
color
uniform
does
the
wear
what
is
the
name
of
the
in
the
following
sentence
cross
out
the
incorrect
statements
leaving
the
correct
one
the
catcher
stands
directly
behind
the
pitcher
in
the
pitcher
box
at
the
gate
taking
tickets
behind
the
batter
at
the
bottom
of
the
main
aisle
selling
what
again
is
the
name
of
the
game
you
expect
to
see
played
do
you
cry
easily
is
there
anything
else
you
would
rather
be
doing
this
afternoon
if
so
please
go
and
do
it
it
has
been
decided
that
the
american
baseball
fan
should
have
a
distinctive
dress
a
choice
has
been
made
from
among
the
more
popular
styles
and
the
following
has
been
designated
as
regulation
embodying
as
it
does
the
spirit
and
tone
of
the
great
national
pastime
straw
hat
worn
well
back
on
the
head
one
cigar
unlighted
held
between
teeth
coat
held
across
knees
vest
worn
but
unbuttoned
and
open
displaying
both
a
belt
and
suspenders
with
gold
connecting
the
bottom
pockets
the
vest
may
be
an
added
expense
to
certain
fans
who
do
not
wear
vests
during
the
summer
months
but
it
has
been
decided
that
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
complete
costume
and
no
true
baseball
enthusiast
will
hesitate
in
complying
viii
how
to
be
a
spectator
at
spring
planting
the
danger
in
watching
gardening
as
in
watching
many
other
sports
is
that
you
may
be
drawn
into
it
yourself
this
you
must
fight
against
your
sinecure
standing
depends
on
a
rigid
abstinence
from
any
of
the
work
itself
once
you
stoop
over
to
hold
one
end
of
a
string
for
a
groaning
planter
once
you
lift
one
shovelful
of
earth
or
toss
out
one
stone
you
become
a
worker
and
a
worker
is
an
abomination
in
the
eyes
of
the
true
garden
watcher
a
fence
is
therefore
a
great
help
you
may
take
up
your
position
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
from
the
garden
and
lean
heavily
against
it
smoking
a
pipe
or
you
may
even
sit
on
it
anything
so
long
as
you
are
out
of
helping
distance
and
yet
near
enough
so
that
the
worker
will
be
within
easy
range
of
your
voice
you
ought
to
be
able
to
point
a
great
deal
also
there
is
much
to
be
watched
during
the
early
stages
of
nothing
is
so
satisfying
as
to
lean
ruminatingly
against
a
fence
and
observe
the
slow
rhythmic
swing
of
the
back
or
hear
the
repeated
scraping
of
the
against
some
buried
rock
it
sometimes
is
a
help
to
the
digger
to
sing
a
chanty
just
to
give
him
the
beat
and
then
sometimes
it
is
not
he
will
tell
you
in
case
he
does
need
it
there
is
always
a
great
deal
for
the
watcher
to
do
in
the
nature
of
comment
on
the
soil
this
is
especially
true
if
it
is
a
new
garden
or
has
never
been
cultivated
before
by
the
present
owner
the
idea
is
to
keep
the
owner
from
becoming
too
sanguine
over
the
prospects
that
soil
looks
pretty
clayey
is
a
good
thing
to
say
it
is
hard
to
say
clearly
too
you
had
better
practise
it
before
trying
it
out
on
the
gardener
i
do
think
that
you
have
much
luck
with
potatoes
in
that
kind
of
earth
is
another
helpful
approach
it
is
even
better
to
go
at
it
the
other
way
finding
out
first
what
the
owner
expects
to
plant
it
may
be
that
he
is
going
to
plant
any
potatoes
and
then
there
you
are
stuck
with
a
perfectly
dandy
prediction
which
has
no
bearing
on
the
case
it
is
time
enough
to
pull
it
after
he
has
told
you
that
he
expects
to
plant
peas
beans
beets
corn
then
you
can
interrupt
him
and
say
corn
incredulously
you
do
expect
to
get
any
corn
in
that
soil
do
you
do
you
know
that
corn
requires
a
large
percentage
of
of
soda
in
the
soil
and
i
do
think
from
the
looks
that
there
is
an
ounce
of
soda
in
your
whole
plot
even
if
the
corn
does
come
up
it
will
be
so
tough
you
ca
eat
it
then
you
can
laugh
and
call
out
to
a
neighbor
or
even
to
the
wife
hey
what
do
you
know
steve
here
thinks
he
going
to
get
some
corn
up
in
this
soil
the
watcher
will
find
plenty
to
do
when
the
time
comes
to
pick
the
stones
out
of
the
freshly
earth
it
is
his
work
to
get
upon
a
high
place
where
he
can
survey
the
whole
garden
and
detect
the
more
obvious
rocks
here
is
a
big
fella
over
here
steve
he
may
say
or
just
run
your
rake
a
little
over
in
that
corner
i
bet
you
find
a
nest
of
them
there
plymouth
rock
is
a
funny
thing
to
call
any
particularly
offensive
boulder
and
is
sure
to
get
a
laugh
especially
if
you
kid
the
digger
about
being
a
pilgrim
and
landing
on
it
he
may
even
give
it
to
you
to
keep
just
as
a
matter
of
convenience
for
the
worker
watchers
have
sometimes
gone
to
the
trouble
of
keeping
count
of
the
number
of
stones
thrown
out
this
is
done
by
shouting
out
the
count
after
each
stone
has
been
tossed
it
makes
a
sort
of
game
of
the
thing
and
in
this
spirit
the
digger
may
be
urged
on
to
make
a
record
that
old
man
come
on
now
make
her
fifty
attaboy
only
one
more
to
go
fifty
and
not
only
stones
will
be
found
but
queer
objects
which
have
got
themselves
buried
in
the
ground
during
the
and
have
become
metamorphosed
so
they
are
half
way
between
one
thing
and
another
as
the
digger
holds
one
of
these
gingerly
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
the
watcher
has
plenty
of
opportunity
to
shout
out
you
better
save
that
it
may
come
in
handy
some
day
what
is
it
eddie
your
old
beard
and
funny
cracks
like
that
here
is
where
it
is
going
to
be
difficult
to
keep
to
your
resolution
about
not
helping
after
the
digging
and
stoning
and
has
been
done
and
the
ground
is
all
nice
and
soft
and
loamy
the
idea
of
running
a
rake
softly
over
the
susceptible
surface
and
leaving
a
beautiful
even
design
in
its
wake
is
almost
too
tempting
to
be
withstood
illustration
atta
boy
only
one
more
to
go
the
worker
himself
will
do
all
that
he
can
to
make
it
hard
for
you
he
will
rake
with
evident
delight
much
longer
than
is
necessary
back
and
forth
across
and
back
cocking
his
head
and
surveying
the
pattern
and
fixing
it
up
along
the
edges
with
a
care
which
is
nothing
short
of
insulting
considering
the
fact
that
the
whole
thing
has
got
to
be
mussed
up
again
when
the
planting
begins
if
you
feel
that
you
can
no
longer
stand
it
without
offering
to
assist
get
down
from
the
fence
and
go
into
your
own
house
and
up
to
your
own
room
there
pray
for
strength
by
the
time
you
come
down
the
owner
of
the
garden
ought
to
have
stopped
raking
and
got
started
on
the
planting
here
the
watcher
task
is
almost
entirely
advisory
and
for
the
first
part
of
the
planting
he
should
lie
low
and
say
nothing
wait
until
the
planter
has
got
his
rows
marked
out
and
has
wobbled
along
on
his
knees
pressing
the
seeds
into
perhaps
half
the
length
of
his
first
row
then
say
hey
there
charlie
you
got
those
rows
going
the
wrong
way
charlie
will
say
no
he
has
then
he
will
ask
what
you
mean
the
wrong
way
why
you
poor
cod
you
got
them
running
north
and
south
they
ought
to
go
east
and
west
the
sun
rises
over
there
does
it
charlie
will
attempt
to
deny
this
but
you
must
go
right
on
and
it
comes
on
up
behind
that
tree
and
over
my
roof
and
sets
over
there
does
it
by
this
time
charlie
will
be
crying
with
rage
well
just
as
soon
as
your
beans
get
up
an
inch
or
two
they
are
going
to
cast
a
shadow
right
down
the
whole
row
and
only
those
in
front
will
ever
get
any
sun
you
ca
grow
things
without
sun
you
know
if
charlie
takes
you
seriously
and
starts
in
to
rearrange
his
rows
in
the
other
direction
you
might
perhaps
get
down
off
the
fence
and
go
in
the
house
you
have
done
enough
if
he
does
take
you
seriously
you
surely
had
better
go
in
ix
the
manhattador
announcements
have
been
made
of
a
to
be
held
in
madison
square
garden
new
york
in
which
only
the
more
humane
features
of
the
spanish
institution
are
to
be
retained
the
bull
will
not
be
killed
or
even
hurt
and
horses
will
not
be
used
as
bait
if
a
must
be
held
this
is
of
course
the
way
to
hold
it
but
what
features
are
to
be
substituted
for
the
playful
gorings
and
stabbings
of
the
madrid
system
something
must
be
done
to
enrage
the
bull
otherwise
he
will
just
sulk
in
a
corner
or
walk
out
on
the
whole
affair
following
is
a
suggestion
for
the
program
of
events
grand
parade
around
the
ring
headed
by
a
and
the
mayor
in
matador
costume
invitations
to
march
in
this
parade
will
be
issued
to
every
one
in
the
set
with
the
exception
of
the
bull
who
will
be
ignored
this
will
make
him
pretty
sore
to
start
with
after
the
marchers
have
been
seated
the
bull
will
be
led
into
the
ring
an
organized
cheering
section
among
the
spectators
will
immediately
start
jeering
him
whistling
and
calling
take
off
those
horns
we
know
you
the
picadors
will
now
enter
bearing
pikes
with
ticklers
on
the
ends
these
will
be
brushed
across
the
bull
nose
as
the
picadors
rush
past
him
on
noisy
the
noise
of
the
is
counted
on
to
irritate
the
bull
quite
as
much
as
the
ticklers
as
he
will
probably
be
trying
to
sleep
at
the
time
enter
the
bandilleros
carrying
various
ornate
articles
of
clothing
with
blue
ribbons
pink
sash
lace
jabot
etc
which
will
one
by
one
be
hung
on
the
bull
when
he
is
looking
in
order
to
accomplish
this
one
of
the
bandilleros
will
engage
the
animal
in
conversation
while
another
sneaks
up
behind
him
with
the
frippery
when
he
is
quite
trimmed
the
bandilleros
will
withdraw
to
behind
a
shelter
and
call
him
lizzie
by
this
time
the
bull
will
be
almost
crying
he
will
be
so
sore
this
is
the
moment
for
the
entrance
of
the
intrepid
matador
the
matador
will
wear
an
outing
cap
with
a
cutaway
and
jaeger
vest
and
the
animal
will
become
so
infuriated
by
this
inexcusable
of
garments
that
he
will
charge
madly
at
his
antagonist
the
matador
who
will
be
equipped
with
will
feint
with
his
left
and
pull
the
down
over
the
bull
eyes
with
his
right
immediately
afterward
stepping
quickly
to
one
side
the
bull
blinded
by
the
daisies
will
not
know
where
to
go
next
and
soon
will
laughingly
admit
that
the
joke
has
been
on
him
he
will
then
allow
the
matador
to
jump
on
his
back
and
ride
around
the
ring
making
attempts
to
unseat
his
rider
x
what
to
do
while
the
family
is
away
somewhere
or
other
the
legend
has
sprung
up
that
as
soon
as
the
family
goes
away
for
the
summer
daddy
brushes
the
hair
over
his
bald
spot
ties
up
his
shoes
and
goes
out
on
a
whirlwind
trip
through
the
hellish
districts
of
town
the
funny
papers
are
responsible
for
this
just
as
they
are
responsible
for
the
idea
that
all
millionaires
are
fat
and
that
negroes
are
inordinately
fond
of
watermelons
i
will
not
deny
that
for
just
about
four
minutes
after
the
train
has
left
bearing
mother
sister
junior
ingabog
and
the
mechanical
walrus
on
their
way
to
anybunkport
daddy
is
suffused
with
a
certain
queer
feeling
of
being
eleven
years
old
and
alone
for
the
first
time
with
fifteen
cents
to
spend
on
anything
he
wants
the
city
seems
to
spread
itself
out
before
him
just
ablaze
with
lights
and
his
feet
rise
lightly
from
the
ground
as
if
attached
to
toy
balloons
i
do
not
deny
that
his
first
move
is
to
straighten
his
tie
but
five
minutes
would
be
a
generous
allowance
for
the
duration
of
this
elation
as
he
leaves
the
station
he
suddenly
becomes
aware
of
the
fact
that
no
one
else
has
heard
about
his
being
everyone
seems
to
be
going
somewhere
in
a
very
important
manner
a
great
many
people
oddly
enough
seem
to
be
going
home
ordinarily
he
would
be
going
home
too
but
there
would
not
be
much
sense
in
going
home
now
without
but
come
come
this
is
no
way
to
feel
buck
up
man
how
about
a
wild
oat
or
two
around
at
the
club
the
doorman
says
that
mcnartly
has
been
in
all
afternoon
and
that
freem
was
in
at
about
but
went
out
again
with
a
bag
there
is
no
one
in
the
lounge
whom
he
ever
saw
before
a
lot
of
new
members
must
have
been
taken
in
at
the
last
meeting
the
club
is
running
down
fast
he
calls
up
eddie
mastayer
office
but
he
has
gone
for
the
day
oh
well
someone
will
probably
come
in
for
dinner
he
has
eaten
dinner
at
the
club
for
a
long
time
and
there
will
be
just
time
for
a
swim
before
settling
down
to
a
nice
piece
of
salmon
steak
all
the
new
members
seem
to
be
congregated
now
in
the
pool
and
they
look
him
over
as
if
he
were
a
child
being
given
a
day
outing
he
becomes
and
slips
on
the
marble
floor
falling
and
hurting
his
shin
quite
badly
who
the
hell
are
these
people
anyway
and
where
is
the
old
bunch
he
emerges
from
the
locker
room
much
hotter
than
he
was
before
and
in
addition
boiling
with
rage
dinner
is
one
of
the
most
depressing
rituals
he
has
ever
gone
through
with
even
the
waiters
seem
unfamiliar
once
he
even
gets
up
and
goes
out
to
the
front
of
the
building
to
see
if
he
has
got
into
the
wrong
by
mistake
pretty
soon
a
terrible
person
whose
name
is
either
riegle
or
ropple
comes
and
sits
down
with
him
offering
as
his
share
of
the
conversation
the
dogmatic
announcement
that
it
has
been
hotter
today
than
it
was
yesterday
this
is
denied
with
some
feeling
although
it
is
known
to
be
true
dessert
is
dispensed
with
for
the
sake
of
getting
away
from
riegle
or
ropple
or
whatever
his
name
is
then
the
first
gay
evening
looms
up
ahead
what
to
do
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
his
drawing
all
the
money
out
of
the
bank
and
tearing
the
town
wide
open
from
the
city
hall
to
the
soldier
monument
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
his
formally
introducing
himself
to
some
nice
blonde
and
watching
her
get
the
meat
out
of
a
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
his
hiring
some
bootlegger
to
anoint
him
with
synthetic
gin
until
he
glows
like
a
and
imagines
that
he
has
just
been
elected
mayor
on
a
free
ticket
absolutely
nothing
stands
in
his
way
except
a
dispairing
vision
of
crêpe
letters
before
his
eyes
reading
and
for
what
he
ends
up
by
going
to
the
movies
where
he
falls
asleep
rather
than
go
home
to
the
empty
house
he
stays
at
the
club
in
the
morning
he
is
at
the
office
at
a
quarter
to
seven
now
there
ought
to
be
several
things
that
a
man
could
do
at
home
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
his
existence
while
the
family
is
away
once
you
get
accustomed
to
the
sound
of
your
footsteps
on
the
floors
and
reach
a
state
of
where
you
do
break
down
and
sob
every
time
you
run
into
a
toy
which
has
been
left
standing
around
there
are
lots
of
ways
of
keeping
yourself
amused
in
an
empty
house
you
can
set
the
victrola
going
and
dance
you
may
never
have
had
an
opportunity
to
get
off
by
yourself
and
practice
those
new
steps
without
someone
coming
suddenly
into
the
room
and
making
you
look
foolish
that
one
big
advantage
about
being
absolutely
alone
in
a
house
you
ca
foolish
no
matter
what
you
do
you
may
foolish
but
no
one
except
you
and
your
god
knows
about
it
and
god
probably
has
a
great
deal
too
much
to
do
to
go
around
telling
people
how
foolish
you
were
so
roll
back
the
rugs
and
put
on
kalua
and
holding
out
one
arm
in
as
fancy
a
manner
as
you
wish
slip
the
other
daintily
about
the
waist
of
an
imaginary
partner
and
step
out
you
be
surprised
to
see
how
graceful
you
are
pretty
soon
you
will
get
confidence
to
try
a
few
tricks
a
very
nice
one
is
to
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
step
point
the
left
toe
delicately
twice
in
time
to
the
music
dip
and
whirl
it
makes
no
difference
if
you
fall
on
the
whirl
who
cares
and
when
you
are
through
dancing
you
can
go
out
to
the
faucet
and
get
yourself
a
drink
provided
the
water
has
been
turned
off
lots
of
fun
may
also
be
had
by
going
out
into
the
kitchen
and
making
things
with
whatever
is
left
in
the
pantry
there
will
probably
be
plenty
of
salt
and
nutmegs
with
boxes
of
cooking
soda
tapioca
and
maybe
if
you
are
lucky
an
old
bottle
of
olives
get
out
a
and
choose
something
that
looks
nice
in
the
picture
in
place
of
the
ingredients
which
you
do
not
have
substitute
those
which
you
do
thus
nutmegs
for
eggs
tapioca
for
truffles
and
water
for
milk
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
then
go
in
and
set
the
table
according
to
the
instructions
in
the
for
a
birthday
party
light
the
candles
and
with
one
of
them
set
fire
to
the
house
there
is
probably
a
for
anybunkport
which
you
can
catch
while
the
place
is
still
burning
to
those
male
readers
whose
families
are
away
for
the
summer
the
above
story
out
along
dotted
line
and
mail
it
to
the
folks
writing
in
pencil
across
the
top
this
guy
has
struck
it
about
right
then
drop
around
tonight
at
to
eddie
apartment
joe
reddish
john
liftwich
harry
thibault
and
three
others
will
be
there
and
the
limit
will
be
fifty
cents
game
absolutely
up
at
no
fooling
and
not
a
minute
xi
roll
your
own
points
on
building
and
maintaining
a
private
tennis
now
that
the
great
war
is
practically
over
until
the
next
one
begins
there
is
very
much
that
you
can
do
with
that
large
plot
of
ground
which
used
to
be
your
it
is
too
small
for
a
and
too
large
for
nasturtiums
obviously
the
only
thing
left
is
a
one
really
ought
to
have
a
of
one
own
those
at
the
club
are
always
so
full
that
on
saturdays
and
sundays
the
people
waiting
to
play
look
like
the
gallery
at
a
davis
cup
match
and
even
when
you
do
get
located
you
have
two
sets
of
balls
to
chase
yours
and
those
of
the
people
in
the
next
court
the
first
thing
is
to
decide
among
yourselves
just
what
kind
of
court
it
is
to
be
there
are
three
kinds
grass
clay
and
in
maine
gravel
courts
are
also
very
popular
father
will
usually
hold
out
for
a
grass
court
because
it
gives
a
slower
bounce
to
the
ball
and
father
is
so
quick
on
the
bounce
as
he
used
to
be
all
mother
insists
on
is
plenty
of
headroom
junior
and
myrtis
will
want
a
clay
one
because
you
can
dance
on
a
clay
one
in
the
evening
the
court
as
finished
will
be
a
combination
grass
and
dirt
with
a
little
late
in
august
a
little
study
will
be
necessary
before
laying
out
the
court
i
mean
you
ca
just
go
out
and
mark
a
court
by
you
must
first
learn
what
the
dimensions
are
supposed
to
be
and
get
as
near
to
them
as
is
humanly
possible
whereas
there
might
be
a
slight
margin
for
error
in
some
measurements
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
both
sides
are
the
same
length
otherwise
you
might
end
up
by
lobbing
back
to
yourself
if
you
got
very
excited
the
worst
place
to
get
the
dope
on
how
to
arrange
a
is
in
the
encyclopædia
britannica
the
article
on
tennis
was
evidently
written
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
it
begins
by
explaining
that
in
america
tennis
is
called
court
tennis
the
only
answer
to
that
is
you
a
liar
the
whole
article
is
like
this
the
name
tennis
it
says
probably
comes
from
the
french
meaning
take
it
play
more
likely
in
my
opinion
it
is
derived
from
the
polish
meaning
go
on
that
was
outside
during
the
fourteenth
century
the
game
was
played
by
the
highest
people
in
france
louis
x
died
from
a
chill
contracted
after
playing
charles
v
was
devoted
to
it
although
he
tried
in
vain
to
stop
it
as
a
pastime
for
the
lower
classes
the
origin
of
the
charles
vi
watched
it
being
played
from
the
room
where
he
was
confined
during
his
attack
of
insanity
and
du
guesclin
amused
himself
with
it
during
the
siege
of
dinan
and
although
it
does
say
so
in
the
encyclopædia
robert
benchley
after
playing
for
the
first
time
in
the
season
of
was
so
lame
under
the
right
that
he
could
lift
a
glass
to
his
mouth
this
fascinating
historical
survey
of
tennis
goes
on
to
say
that
in
the
reign
of
henri
iv
the
game
was
so
popular
that
it
was
said
that
there
were
more
in
paris
than
drunkards
in
england
the
drunkards
of
england
were
so
upset
by
this
boast
that
they
immediately
started
a
drive
for
membership
with
the
slogan
five
thousand
more
drunkards
by
april
and
to
hell
with
france
one
thing
led
to
another
until
war
was
declared
the
net
does
not
appear
until
the
century
up
until
that
time
a
rope
either
fringed
or
tasseled
was
stretched
across
the
court
this
probably
had
to
be
abandoned
because
it
was
so
easy
to
crawl
under
it
and
chase
your
opponent
there
might
also
have
been
ample
opportunity
for
the
person
playing
at
the
net
or
at
the
rope
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
player
directly
opposite
by
waving
his
racquet
high
in
the
air
and
then
to
kick
him
under
the
rope
knocking
him
for
a
loop
while
the
ball
was
being
put
into
play
in
his
territory
you
have
to
watch
these
frenchmen
every
minute
the
encyclopedia
britannica
gives
fifteen
lines
to
tennis
in
america
it
says
that
few
tennis
courts
existed
in
america
before
but
that
now
there
are
courts
in
boston
new
york
chicago
tuxedo
and
lakewood
and
several
other
places
everyone
try
hard
to
think
now
just
where
those
other
places
are
which
reminds
us
that
one
of
them
is
going
to
be
in
your
side
yard
where
the
garden
used
to
be
after
you
have
got
the
dimensions
from
the
encyclopædia
call
up
a
professional
maker
and
get
him
to
do
the
job
for
you
just
tell
him
that
you
want
a
once
it
is
built
the
fun
begins
according
to
the
arrangement
each
member
of
the
family
is
to
have
certain
hours
during
which
it
belongs
to
them
and
no
one
else
thus
the
children
can
play
before
breakfast
and
after
breakfast
until
the
sun
gets
around
so
that
the
west
court
is
shady
then
daddy
and
mother
and
sprightly
friends
may
take
it
over
later
in
the
afternoon
the
children
have
it
again
and
if
there
is
any
light
left
after
dinner
daddy
can
take
a
whirl
at
the
ball
what
actually
will
happen
is
this
right
after
breakfast
roger
beeman
who
lives
across
the
street
and
who
is
home
for
the
summer
with
a
couple
of
college
friends
who
are
just
dandy
looking
will
come
over
and
ask
if
they
may
use
the
court
until
someone
wants
it
they
will
let
myrtis
play
with
them
and
perhaps
myrtis
from
westover
they
will
play
five
sets
running
into
scores
like
and
at
lunch
time
will
make
plans
for
a
ride
into
the
country
for
the
afternoon
daddy
will
stick
around
in
the
offing
all
dressed
up
in
his
waiting
to
play
with
uncle
ted
but
somehow
or
other
every
time
he
approaches
the
court
the
young
people
will
be
in
the
middle
of
a
set
illustration
for
three
hours
there
is
a
great
deal
of
screaming
after
lunch
lillian
nieman
who
lives
three
houses
down
the
street
will
come
up
and
ask
if
she
may
bring
her
cousin
just
on
from
the
west
to
play
a
set
until
someone
wants
the
court
lillian
cousin
has
never
played
tennis
before
but
she
has
done
a
lot
of
croquet
and
thinks
she
ought
to
pick
tennis
up
rather
easily
for
three
hours
there
is
a
great
deal
of
screaming
with
lillian
and
her
cousin
hitting
the
ball
an
aggregate
of
eleven
times
while
daddy
patters
up
and
down
the
all
dressed
up
in
white
practising
shots
against
the
netting
finally
the
girls
will
ask
him
to
play
with
them
and
he
will
thank
them
and
say
that
he
has
to
go
in
the
house
now
as
he
is
all
perspiration
and
is
afraid
of
catching
cold
after
dinner
there
is
dancing
on
the
court
by
the
young
people
anyway
daddy
is
getting
pretty
old
for
tennis
xii
do
insects
think
in
a
recent
book
entitled
the
psychic
life
of
insects
professor
bouvier
says
that
we
must
be
careful
not
to
credit
the
little
winged
fellows
with
intelligence
when
they
behave
in
what
seems
like
an
intelligent
manner
they
may
be
only
reacting
i
would
like
to
confront
the
professor
with
an
instance
of
reasoning
power
on
the
part
of
an
insect
which
can
not
be
explained
away
in
any
such
manner
during
the
summer
of
while
i
was
at
work
on
my
treatise
do
larvae
laugh
we
kept
a
female
wasp
at
our
cottage
in
the
adirondacks
it
really
was
more
like
a
child
of
our
own
than
a
wasp
except
that
it
more
like
a
wasp
than
a
child
of
our
own
that
was
one
of
the
ways
we
told
the
difference
it
was
still
a
young
wasp
when
we
got
it
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
and
for
some
time
we
could
not
get
it
to
eat
or
drink
it
was
so
shy
since
it
was
a
female
we
decided
to
call
it
miriam
but
soon
the
children
nickname
for
it
pudge
became
a
fixture
and
pudge
it
was
from
that
time
on
one
evening
i
had
been
working
late
in
my
laboratory
fooling
round
with
some
gin
and
other
chemicals
and
in
leaving
the
room
i
tripped
over
a
nine
of
diamonds
which
someone
had
left
lying
on
the
floor
and
knocked
over
my
card
catalogue
containing
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
larvae
worth
knowing
in
north
america
the
cards
went
everywhere
i
was
too
tired
to
stop
to
pick
them
up
that
night
and
went
sobbing
to
bed
just
as
mad
as
i
could
be
as
i
went
however
i
noticed
the
wasp
flying
about
in
circles
over
the
scattered
cards
maybe
pudge
will
pick
them
up
i
said
to
myself
never
thinking
for
one
moment
that
such
would
be
the
case
when
i
came
down
the
next
morning
pudge
was
still
asleep
over
in
her
box
evidently
tired
out
and
well
she
might
have
been
for
there
on
the
floor
lay
the
cards
scattered
all
about
just
as
i
had
left
them
the
night
before
the
faithful
little
insect
had
buzzed
about
all
night
trying
to
come
to
some
decision
about
picking
them
up
and
arranging
them
in
the
and
then
figuring
out
for
herself
that
as
she
knew
practically
nothing
about
larvae
of
any
sort
except
she
would
probably
make
more
of
a
mess
of
rearranging
them
than
as
if
she
left
them
on
the
floor
for
me
to
fix
it
was
just
too
much
for
her
to
tackle
and
discouraged
she
went
over
and
lay
down
in
her
box
where
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
if
this
is
not
an
answer
to
professor
bouvier
statement
that
insects
have
no
reasoning
power
i
do
not
know
what
is
xiii
the
score
in
the
stands
the
opening
week
of
the

out
few
surprises

practically
the
same
as
when
the

closed
last
fall
most
of
the
fans
busying
themselves
before
the
first
game
started
by
picking
old
seat
checks
and
october
peanut
crumbs
out
of
the
pockets
of
their
overcoats

at

they
would
have
it
so
that
cleveland

sports
these

feel
that
there
were

reading

aloud
one
of
the
minor
enjoyable
features
of
having
children
is
the
necessity
of
reading
aloud
to
them
the
colored
comic
sections
in
the
sunday
papers
and
no
matter
how
good
your
intentions
may
have
been
at
first
to
keep
the
things
out
of
the
house
the
comic
sections
not
the
children
sooner
or
later
there
comes
a
sunday
when
you
find
that
your
little
boy
has
in
some
underground
fashion
learned
of
the
raucous
existence
of
or
the
and
is
demanding
the
current
installment
with
a
fervor
which
will
not
be
denied
sunday
morning
in
our
house
has
now
become
a
time
for
low
subterfuge
on
the
part
of
doris
and
me
in
our
attempts
to
be
somewhere
else
when
junior
appears
dragging
the
funnies
a
loathsome
term
in
itself
to
be
read
to
him
i
make
believe
that
the
furnace
looks
as
if
it
might
fall
apart
at
any
minute
if
it
is
not
watched
closely
and
doris
calls
from
upstairs
that
she
may
be
some
time
over
the
weekly
accounts
but
sooner
or
later
junior
ferrets
one
of
us
out
and
presents
himself
beaming
will
you
read
me
the
is
the
dread
sentence
which
opens
the
siege
it
then
becomes
a
rather
contest
between
doris
and
me
to
see
which
can
pick
the
more
bearable
pages
to
read
leaving
the
interminable
ones
containing
great
balloons
pregnant
with
words
for
the
other
i
usually
find
that
doris
has
read
the
briggs
page
to
junior
before
i
get
downstairs
the
briggs
page
and
possibly
the
drawings
of
de
being
the
only
department
that
an
adult
mind
can
dwell
on
and
keep
its
now
will
read
you
briggs
says
doris
with
the
air
of
an
indulgent
parent
but
settling
down
with
great
relish
to
the
task
and
daddy
will
read
you
the
others
having
been
stuck
for
over
a
year
with
the
others
i
have
now
reached
a
stage
where
i
utilize
a
sort
of
second
sight
in
the
reading
whereby
the
words
are
seen
and
pronounced
without
ever
registering
on
my
brain
at
all
and
as
i
sit
with
junior
impassive
on
my
lap
just
why
children
should
so
frantically
seek
to
have
the
funnies
read
to
them
is
a
mystery
for
they
never
by
any
chance
seem
to
derive
the
slightest
emotional
pleasure
from
the
recital
but
sit
in
stony
silence
as
if
they
rather
disapproved
of
the
whole
thing
after
all
i
have
evolved
a
system
which
enables
me
to
carry
on
a
little
constructive
thinking
while
reading
aloud
thereby
keeping
the
time
from
being
entirely
wasted
heaven
knows
we
get
little
enough
opportunity
to
sit
down
and
think
things
out
in
this
busy
world
so
that
this
little
period
of
mental
freedom
is
in
the
nature
of
a
godsend
thus
is
being
read
here
he
says
but
this
is
tough
luck
a
new
automobile
an
no
place
to
go
and
the
dog
is
saying
ai
so
tough
at
that
then
here
in
the
next
picture
the
old
man
says
percy
ai
in
my
class
as
a
chauffeur
he
ai
as
fearless
as
me
and
this
one
is
saying
there
that
looks
like
the
old
tin
lizzie
that
i
gave
to
the
general
last
year
i
guess
i
take
a
peek
and
see
what
up
what
are
you
doing
hanging
around
here
what
do
you
think
this
is
a
hotel
where
do
you
get
that
stuff
you
ai

you

etc
here
i
am
in
the
thirties
and
it
is
high
time
that
i
made
something
of
myself
is
my
job
as
good
as
i
deserve
by
studying
nights
i
might
fit
myself
for
a
better
position
in
the
foreign
exchange
department
but
that
would
mean
an
outlay
of
money
furthermore
is
it
on
the
whole
wise
to
attempt
to
hurry
the
workings
of
fate
is
not
perhaps
the
determinist
right
who
says
that
what
we
are
and
what
we
ever
can
be
is
already
written
in
the
books
that
we
can
not
alter
the
workings
of
destiny
one
iota
this
theory
is
of
course
tenable
but
on
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
to
take
the
matter
into
my
own
hands
etc
etc

then
when
the

of
boiling
water

training
a
year
and
a
half
did
not
seem
too
early
an
age
at
which
to
begin
as
doris
said
there
is
no
reason
why
a
child
of
a
year
and
a
half
should
have
rudimentary
cravings
for
and
really
there
is
any
reason

you
come
right

that
by

she
is
convinced
that
all
children
should
have
their
removed
before
they
are
four
or
that
you
should
hire
four
servants
a
day
on
shifts
or
that
as
in
the
present
case
no
child
should
be
sent
to
a
regular
school
until
he
has
determined
for
himself
what
his
profession
is
going
to
be

then
should
be

was
to
be

entirely
to
himself
the
theory
being
that
he
would
find
in
some
form
or
other
and
that
by
watching
him
carefully
it
could
be
determined
just
what
should
be
developed
in
him
or
rather
just
what
he
should
be
allowed
to
develop
in
himself
he
was
not
to
be
corrected
in
any
way
or
guided
and
he
was
to
call
us
doris
and
monty
instead
of
mother

father
we
were
to
be
just
pals
nothing
more
otherwise

would

few

he
might

himself

ought
to
suggest
to
him
that
nobody
who
really
anybody
eats
mortar
i
said
i
do
like
to
interfere
replied
doris
i
trying
to
figure
out
what
it
may
mean
he
may
have
the
makings
of
a
sculptor
in
him
but
one
could
see
that
she
was
a
little
worried
so
i
did
say
the
cheap
and
obvious
thing
that
at
any
rate
he
had
the
makings
of
a
sculpture
in
him
or
would
have
in
a
few
more
days
of
soft
putty
was
put
at
his
disposal
in
case
he
might
feel
like
doing
a
little
modeling
we
did
expect
much
of
him
at
first
of
course
maybe
just
a
panther
or
a
little
general
sherman
but
if
that
was
to
be
his
we
were
going
to
have
it
said
that
his
career
was
nipped
in
the
bud
for
the
lack
of
a
little
putty
the
first
thing
that
he
did
was
to
stop
up
the
keyhole
in
the
door
while
i
was
in
the
tub
so
that
i
had
to
crawl
out
on
the
piazza
roof
and
into
the
window
it
did
seem
as
if
there
might
be
some
way
of
preventing
a
recurrence
of
that
sort
of
thing
without
submerging
his
individuality
too
much
but
doris
said
no
if
he
were
disciplined
now
he
would
grow
up
nursing
a
complex
against
putty
and
against
me
and
might
even
try
to
marry
aunt
marian
she
had
read
of
a
little
boy
who
had
been
punished
by
his
father
for
putting
soap
on
the
cellar
stairs
and
from
that
time
on
all
the
rest
of
his
life
every
time
he
saw
soap
he
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
that
he
was
riding
in
the
cab
of
a
runaway
engine
dressed
as
perriot
which
meant
of
course
that
he
had
a
suppressed
desire
to
kill
his
father
it
almost
seemed
however
as
if
the
risk
were
worth
taking
if
junior
could
be
shown
the
fundamentally
nature
of
an
act
like
stuffing
keyholes
with
putty
but
nothing
was
done
about
it
except
to
take
the
putty
supply
away
for
that
day
the
chief
trouble
came
however
in
junior
contacts
with
other
neighborhood
children
whose
parents
had
not
seen
the
light
when
junior
would
lead
a
movement
among
the
young
bloods
to
pull
up
the
nasturtiums
or
would
show
flashes
of
personality
by
hitting
little
leda
hemming
over
the
forehead
with
a
trowel
hemming
could
never
be
made
to
see
that
to
reprimand
junior
would
be
to
crush
out
his
individuality
all
she
would
say
was
just
look
at
those
nasturtiums
over
and
over
again
and
the
hemming
children
were
given
to
understand
that
it
would
be
all
right
if
they
did
play
with
junior
quite
so
much
illustration
deemster
did
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
at
all
this
morning
however
the
thing
solved
itself
while
expressing
himself
in
putty
in
the
nursery
junior
succeeded
in
making
a
really
excellent
lifemask
of
deemster
little
girl
who
had
come
over
to
spend
the
morning
with
him
she
had
a
little
difficulty
in
breathing
but
it
really
was
a
fine
mask
deemster
however
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
at
all
and
after
excavating
her
little
girl
took
doris
aside
it
was
decided
that
junior
is
perhaps
too
young
to
start
in
on
his
career
unguided
that
is
junior
that
you
can
hear
now
i
think
xviii
polyp
with
a
past
the
story
of
an
organism
with
a
heart
of
all
forms
of
animal
life
the
polyp
is
probably
the
most
neglected
by
fanciers
people
seem
willing
to
pay
attention
to
anything
cats
lizards
canaries
or
even
fish
but
simply
because
the
polyp
is
reserved
by
nature
and
not
given
to
showing
off
or
wearing
its
heart
on
its
sleeve
it
is
left
alone
under
the
sea
to
slave
away
at
with
never
a
kind
word
or
a
pat
on
the
tentacles
from
anybody
it
was
quite
by
accident
that
i
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
human
side
of
a
polyp
i
had
been
working
on
a
thesis
on
emotional
crises
in
sponge
life
and
came
upon
a
polyp
formation
on
a
piece
of
coral
in
the
course
of
my
laboratory
work
to
say
that
i
was
astounded
would
be
putting
it
mildly
i
was
surprised
the
difficulty
in
research
work
in
this
field
came
in
isolating
a
single
polyp
from
the
rest
in
order
to
study
the
personal
peculiarities
of
the
little
organism
for
as
is
so
often
the
case
even
i
fear
with
us
great
big
humans
sometimes
the
individual
behaves
in
an
entirely
different
manner
in
private
from
the
one
he
adopts
when
there
is
a
crowd
around
and
a
polyp
among
all
creatures
has
a
minimum
of
time
to
himself
in
which
to
sit
down
and
think
there
is
always
a
crowd
of
other
polyps
dropping
in
on
him
urging
him
to
make
a
fourth
in
a
string
of
coral
beads
or
just
to
come
out
and
stick
around
on
a
rock
for
the
sake
of
the
one
which
i
finally
succeeded
in
isolating
was
an
engaging
organism
with
a
provocative
manner
and
a
little
way
of
wrinkling
up
its
ectoderm
which
put
you
at
once
at
your
ease
there
could
be
no
formality
about
your
relations
with
this
polyp
five
minutes
after
your
first
meeting
you
were
just
like
one
great
big
family
although
i
have
no
desire
to
retail
gossip
i
think
that
readers
of
this
treatise
ought
to
be
made
aware
of
the
fact
if
indeed
they
do
not
already
know
it
that
a
polyp
is
really
neither
one
thing
nor
another
in
matters
of
gender
one
day
it
may
be
a
little
boy
polyp
another
day
a
little
girl
according
to
its
whim
or
practical
considerations
of
policy
on
gray
days
when
everything
seems
to
be
going
wrong
it
may
decide
that
it
will
be
neither
boy
nor
girl
but
will
just
drift
i
think
that
if
we
big
human
cousins
of
the
little
polyp
were
to
follow
the
example
set
by
these
lowliest
of
god
creatures
in
this
matter
we
all
would
find
ourselves
much
better
off
in
the
end
am
i
not
right
little
polyp
what
was
my
surprise
then
to
discover
my
little
friend
one
day
in
a
gloomy
and
morose
mood
it
refused
the
which
i
had
brought
it
and
i
observed
through
the
microscope
that
it
was
shaking
with
sobs
lifting
it
up
with
a
pair
of
pincers
i
took
it
over
to
the
window
to
let
it
watch
the
automobiles
go
by
a
diversion
which
had
in
the
past
never
failed
to
amuse
but
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
interested
a
tune
from
the
victrola
fell
equally
flat
even
though
i
set
my
little
charge
on
the
center
of
the
disc
and
allowed
it
to
revolve
at
a
dizzy
pace
which
frolic
usually
sent
it
into
spasms
of
excited
giggling
something
was
wrong
it
was
under
emotional
stress
of
the
most
racking
kind
i
consulted
klunzinger
die
korallenthiere
des
rothen
meeres
and
there
found
that
at
an
early
age
the
polyp
is
quite
likely
to
become
the
victim
of
a
sentimental
passion
which
is
directed
at
its
own
self
in
other
words
my
tiny
companion
was
in
love
with
itself
bitterly
desperately
in
love
in
an
attempt
to
divert
it
from
this
madness
i
took
it
on
an
extended
tour
of
the
continent
visiting
all
the
old
cathedrals
and
stopping
at
none
but
the
best
hotels
the
malady
grew
worse
instead
of
better
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
warm
sun
of
granada
would
bring
the
color
back
into
those
pale
tentacles
but
there
the
inevitable
romance
in
the
soft
air
was
only
fuel
to
the
flame
and
in
the
shadow
of
the
alhambra
my
little
polyp
gave
up
the
fight
and
died
of
a
broken
heart
without
ever
having
declared
its
love
to
itself
i
returned
to
america
shortly
after
not
a
little
chastened
by
what
i
had
witnessed
of
nature
wonders
in
the
realm
of
passion
xix
holt
who
goes
there
the
reliance
of
young
mothers
on
emmett
holt
the
care
and
feeding
of
children
has
become
a
national
custom
especially
during
the
early
infancy
of
the
first
baby
does
the
son
rise
and
set
by
what
holt
says
but
there
are
several
questions
which
come
to
mind
which
are
not
included
in
the
handy
questionnaire
arranged
by
the
noted
and
as
he
is
probably
too
busy
to
answer
them
himself
we
have
compiled
an
appendix
which
he
may
incorporate
in
the
next
edition
of
his
book
if
he
cares
to
of
course
if
he
does
care
to
it
is
compulsory
bathing
should
the
parent
wear
while
bathing
the
child
a
rubber
will
usually
be
sufficient
with
perhaps
a
pair
of
and
gloves
a
bath
should
never
be
given
a
child
until
at
least
one
hour
after
eating
that
is
after
the
parent
has
eaten
are
the
objections
to
as
a
means
of
bathing
children
they
are
too
easily
swallowed
and
after
six
or
seven
wet
have
been
swallowed
the
child
is
likely
to
become
heavy
and
lethargic
what
circumstances
should
the
daily
be
omitted
almost
any
excuse
will
do
the
may
be
too
cold
or
too
hot
or
the
child
may
be
too
sleepy
or
too
or
the
parent
may
have
lame
knees
or
lead
poisoning
and
anyway
the
child
had
a
good
bath
yesterday
clothing
should
the
infant
be
held
during
dressing
and
undressing
any
carpenter
will
be
glad
to
sell
you
a
vise
which
can
be
attached
to
the
edge
of
the
table
place
the
infant
in
the
vise
and
turn
the
screw
until
there
is
a
slight
redness
under
the
pressure
be
careful
not
to
turn
it
too
tight
or
the
child
will
resent
it
but
on
the
other
hand
care
should
be
taken
not
to
leave
it
too
loose
otherwise
the
child
will
be
continually
falling
out
on
the
floor
and
you
will
never
get
it
dressed
that
way

most
important

weight
should
a
child
be
weighed
place
the
child
in
the
scales
the
father
should
then
sit
on
top
of
the
child
to
hold
him
down
weigh
father
and
child
together
then
deduct
the
father
weight
from
the
gross

and
the
weight
of
the

the
result
fresh

are
the
objections
to
an
infant
sleeping
sleeping
in
the
city
is
all
right
but
children
sleeping
out
of
doors
in
the
country
are
likely
to
be
kissed
by
wandering
cows
and
things
this
should
never
be
permitted
under
any
circumstances

does
the
infant

laugh
aloud
when
father
tries
to
pin
it
up
for
the
first
time
at
two
years
the
child
makes
no
attempt
to
talk
what
should
be
suspected
that
it
has
yet
seen
anyone
worth
talking

not

xx
the
committee
on
the
whole
a
new
plan
has
just
been
submitted
for
running
the
railroads
that
makes
one
hundred
and
eleven
the
present
suggestion
involves
the
services
of
some
sixteen
committees
now
presumably
the
idea
is
to
get
the
roses
back
into
the
cheeks
of
the
railroads
so
that
they
will
go
running
about
from
place
to
place
again
and
perhaps
make
a
little
money
on
pleasant
saturdays
and
sundays
but
if
these
proposed
committees
are
anything
like
other
committees
which
we
have
had
to
do
with
the
following
will
be
a
fair
example
of
how
our
railroads
will
be
run
the
on
the
punching
of
rebate
slips
will
have
a
meeting
called
for
five
in
the
private
grill
room
at
the
building
postcards
will
have
been
sent
out
the
day
before
by
the
secretary
saying
please
try
to
be
present
as
there
are
several
important
matters
to
be
brought
up
this
will
so
pique
the
curiosity
of
the
members
that
they
will
hardly
be
able
to
wait
until
five
one
will
come
at
four
by
mistake
and
after
steaming
up
and
down
the
corridor
for
half
an
hour
will
go
home
and
send
in
his
resignation
at
the
secretary
will
bustle
in
with
a
briefcase
and
a
map
showing
the
weather
areas
over
the
entire
united
states
for
the
preceding
year
he
will
be
very
warm
from
hurrying
at
two
members
of
the
committee
will
stroll
in
one
of
them
saying
to
the
other
so
the
irishman
turns
to
the
jew
and
says
i
knew
your
father
before
that
knew
your
father
before
that
they
will
then
seat
themselves
at
one
end
of
the
just
as
another
member
comes
hurrying
in
time
one
of
the
being
the
chairman
he
will
pound
on
the
table
and
say
as
some
of
us
have
to
get
away
early
i
think
that
we
had
better
begin
now
although
entwhistle
and
pearly
are
not
here
i
met
pearly
last
night
at
the
vegetarian
club
dinner
says
one
of
the
members
and
he
said
that
he
might
be
a
little
late
today
but
that
he
would
surely
come
his
wife
has
just
had
a
very
delicate
throat
operation
i
understand
offers
a
committeeman
who
is
drawing
concentric
circles
on
his
pad
of
paper
bad
weather
for
throat
operations
says
the
secretary
that
right
says
the
chairman
looking
through
a
pile
of
papers
for
one
which
he
has
left
at
home
but
let
get
down
to
business
at
the
last
meeting
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
advisable
to
continue
having
conductors
punch
the
little
hole
at
the
bottom
of
rebate
slips
as
you
know
the
slip
says
redeemable
if
punched
here
now
someone
brought
up
the
point
that
it
seems
silly
to
give
out
a
rebate
slip
at
all
if
there
is
going
to
be
any
rebate
on
it
a
was
appointed
to
go
into
the
matter
and
i
would
like
to
ask
twing
the
chairman
what
he
has
to
report
twing
will
clear
his
throat
and
start
to
speak
but
will
make
only
an
abortive
sound
he
will
then
clear
his
throat
again
chairman
the
other
members
of
the
and
myself
were
unable
to
get
exactly
the
data
on
this
that
we
wanted
and
i
delegated
entwhistle
to
dig
up
something
which
he
said
he
had
read
recently
in
the
files
of
the
but
entwhistle
does
seem
to
be
here
today
and
so
i
am
unable
to
report
his
findings
it
was
however
the
sense
of
the
meeting
that
the
conductors
should
not
illustration
that
right
says
the
chairman
should
not
what
inquires
pearly
who
has
just
sneaked
in
knocking
three
hats
to
the
floor
while
hanging
up
his
coat
pearly
is
never
answered
for
the
chairman
looks
at
his
watch
and
says
i
very
sorry
gentlemen
but
i
have
an
appointment
at
and
must
be
going
supposing
i
appoint
a
consisting
of
pearly
twing
and
berry
to
find
entwhistle
and
see
what
he
dug
out
of
the
files
of
the
then
at
the
next
meeting
we
can
have
a
report
from
both
and
will
also
hear
from
professor
mcklicktric
who
has
just
returned
from
panama
a
motion
to
adjourn
is
now
in
order
do
i
hear
such
a
motion
after
listening
carefully
he
hears
it
and
the
railroads
run
themselves
for
another
week
xxi
noting
an
increase
in
bigamy
either
more
men
are
marrying
more
wives
than
ever
before
or
they
are
getting
more
careless
about
it
during
the
past
week
bigamy
has
crowded
baseball
out
of
the
papers
and
while
this
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
cold
rainy
week
and
little
baseball
could
be
played
yet
there
is
a
tendency
to
be
noted
there
somewhere
all
those
wishing
to
note
a
tendency
will
continue
on
into
the
next
paragraph
there
is
of
course
nothing
new
in
bigamy
anyone
who
goes
in
for
it
with
the
idea
of
originating
a
new
fad
which
shall
be
known
by
his
name
like
the
daguerreotype
or
potatoes
will
have
to
reckon
with
the
priority
claims
of
several
hundred
generations
of
historical
characters
most
of
them
wearing
brown
beards
just
why
beards
and
bigamy
seem
to
have
gone
hand
in
hand
through
the
ages
is
a
matter
for
the
professional
humorists
to
determine
we
certainly
have
got
time
to
do
it
here
but
the
unearthed
during
the
past
week
have
a
certain
homey
flavor
lacking
in
some
of
those
which
have
gone
before
for
instance
the
man
in
new
jersey
who
had
two
wives
living
right
with
him
all
of
the
time
in
the
same
apartment
no
need
for
subterfuge
here
no
deceiving
one
about
the
other
it
was
just
a
matter
of
walking
back
and
forth
between
the
and
the
study
this
is
of
course
bigamy
under
ideal
conditions
but
in
tracing
a
tendency
like
this
we
must
not
deal
so
much
with
concrete
cases
as
with
drifts
and
curves
a
couple
of
statistics
are
also
necessary
especially
if
it
is
an
alarming
tendency
that
is
being
traced
the
statistics
follow
in
alphabetical
order
in
the
united
states
during
the
years
there
were
weddings
of
these
were
church
weddings
strongly
against
the
wishes
of
the
bridegrooms
concerned
in
these
weddings
silver
were
received
as
gifts
starting
with
these
figures
as
a
basis
we
turn
to
the
report
of
the
pennsylvania
state
committee
on
outdoor
gymnastics
for
the
year
beginning
january
and
ending
a
year
later
this
report
being
pretty
fairly
uninteresting
we
leave
it
and
turn
to
another
report
which
covers
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
rugs
this
has
a
picture
of
a
rug
in
it
and
a
darned
good
likeness
it
is
too
in
this
rug
report
we
find
that
it
takes
a
navajo
indian
only
eleven
days
to
weave
a
rug
x
with
a
swastika
design
in
the
middle
eleven
days
it
seems
incredible
why
it
takes
only
days
to
make
a
year
now
having
seen
that
there
are
men
and
women
in
this
country
today
who
can
neither
read
nor
write
and
that
of
these
only
or
a
little
over
half
are
colored
what
are
we
to
conclude
what
is
to
be
the
effect
on
our
national
morale
who
is
to
pay
this
gigantic
bill
for
naval
armament
before
answering
these
questions
any
further
than
this
let
us
quote
from
an
authority
on
the
subject
a
man
who
has
given
the
best
years
or
at
any
rate
some
very
good
years
of
his
life
to
research
in
this
field
and
who
now
takes
exactly
the
stand
which
we
have
been
outlining
in
this
article
i
would
not
he
says
in
a
speech
delivered
before
the
girls
friendly
society
of
laurel
hill
i
would
not
for
one
minute
detract
from
the
glory
of
those
who
have
brought
this
country
to
its
present
state
of
financial
prominence
among
the
nations
of
the
world
and
yet
as
i
think
back
on
those
dark
days
i
am
impelled
to
voice
the
protest
of
millions
of
american
citizens
yet
unborn
perhaps
some
of
our
little
readers
remember
what
the
major
premise
of
this
article
was
if
so
will
they
please
communicate
with
the
writer
oh
yes
bigamy
well
it
certainly
is
funny
how
many
cases
of
bigamy
you
hear
about
nowadays
either
more
men
are
marrying
more
wives
than
ever
before
or
they
are
getting
more
careless
about
it
that
sounds
very
very
familiar
it
is
barely
possible
that
it
is
the
sentence
with
which
this
article
opens
we
say
so
many
things
in
the
course
of
one
article
that
repetitions
are
quite
likely
to
creep
in
at
any
rate
the
tendency
seems
to
be
toward
an
increase
in
bigamy
xxii
the
real
wiglaf
man
and
monarch
much
time
has
been
devoted
of
late
by
ardent
biographers
to
shedding
light
on
misunderstood
characters
in
history
especially
british
rulers
we
can
not
let
injustice
any
longer
be
done
to
king
wiglaf
the
monarch
of
central
britain
in
the
early
ninth
century
the
fall
of
the
kingdom
of
mercia
in
under
the
the
onslaughts
of
ecgberht
the
have
been
laid
to
wiglaf
untidy
personal
habits
and
his
alleged
mania
for
practical
joking
the
accompanying
biographical
sketch
may
serve
to
disclose
some
of
the
more
intimate
details
of
the
character
of
the
man
and
to
alter
in
some
degree
history
unfavorable
estimate
of
him
our
first
glimpse
of
the
wiglaf
who
was
one
day
to
become
ruler
of
mercia
the
heart
of
england
music
please
is
when
at
the
age
of
seven
he
was
taken
by
oswier
his
father
murderer
to
see
siddons
play
every
subject
of
biographical
treatment
regardless
of
the
period
in
which
he
or
she
lived
must
have
been
taken
at
an
early
age
to
see
siddons
play
it
is
part
of
the
code
of
biography
while
sitting
in
the
royal
box
the
young
prince
wiglaf
was
asked
what
he
thought
of
the
performance
rotten
he
answered
and
left
the
place
abruptly
setting
fire
to
the
building
as
he
went
out
beobald
in
citing
the
above
incident
in
his
chronicles
of
comical
kings
calls
it
an
hendy
hap
ichabbe
and
perhaps
he
right
events
proceeded
in
rapid
succession
after
this
for
the
young
boy
and
we
next
find
him
facing
marriage
with
a
stiff
mystery
has
always
surrounded
the
reasons
which
led
to
the
choice
of
princess
offa
as
wiglaf
bride
in
fact
it
has
never
been
quite
certain
whether
or
not
she
his
bride
no
one
ever
saw
them
together
on
several
occasions
he
is
reported
to
have
asked
his
chamberlain
who
she
was
as
she
passed
by
on
the
street
and
yet
the
theory
persists
that
she
was
his
wife
owing
doubtless
to
the
fact
that
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
of
otford
he
sent
a
message
to
her
asking
where
in
god
name
his
clean
shirts
had
been
put
when
they
came
back
from
the
we
come
now
to
that
period
in
wiglaf
life
which
has
been
for
so
many
centuries
the
cause
of
historical
speculation
pro
and
con
the
reference
is
of
course
to
his
dealings
with
aethelbald
the
ambassador
from
wessex
every
schoolboy
has
taken
part
in
the
controversy
but
how
many
really
know
the
inside
facts
of
the
case
examination
of
the
correspondence
between
these
two
men
shows
wiglaf
to
have
been
simply
a
great
overgrown
boy
in
the
whole
affair
all
claims
of
his
having
had
an
eye
on
the
throne
of
northumbria
fade
away
under
the
delightful
ingenuousness
of
his
attitude
as
expressed
in
these
letters
i
should
of
thought
he
writes
in
to
his
sister
that
anyone
who
was
not
drunk
would
have
known
better
than
to
of
tried
to
walk
through
that
from
the
beech
up
to
the
without
sneekers
on
which
is
what
that
ninn
aethelbald
tryed
to
do
this
am
well
say
laffter
is
no
name
for
what
you
would
of
done
if
you
had
seen
him
he
looked
like
he
was
trying
to
walk
a
hey
i
yelled
at
him
all
the
way
do
you
think
you
are
trying
to
walk
a
well
say
maybe
that
did
make
him
sore
shortly
after
this
letter
was
written
wiglaf
ascended
the
throne
of
mercia
his
father
having
disappeared
saturday
night
without
trace
a
peasant
some
years
after
said
that
he
met
the
old
king
walking
along
a
road
near
what
is
now
the
scottish
border
telling
people
that
he
was
carrying
a
letter
of
greeting
from
the
mayor
of
pontygn
to
the
mayor
of
langoscgirh
others
say
that
he
fell
into
the
sea
off
the
coast
of
wales
and
became
what
is
now
known
as
king
rocks
this
last
has
never
been
authenticated
at
any
rate
the
son
on
ascending
the
throne
became
king
his
first
official
act
was
to
order
dinner
a
nice
juicy
steak
he
is
said
to
have
called
for
french
fries
apple
pie
and
a
cup
of
coffee
it
is
probable
that
he
really
said
a
coff
of
cuppee
however
as
he
was
a
wag
of
the
first
water
and
loved
a
joke
as
well
as
the
next
king
we
are
now
thrown
into
the
maelstrom
of
contradictory
historical
data
some
of
which
credits
wiglaf
with
being
the
greatest
ruler
mercia
ever
had
and
some
of
which
indicates
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
royal
bum
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
this
biography
to
try
to
settle
the
dispute
all
we
know
for
a
fact
is
that
he
was
a
very
human
man
who
had
faults
like
the
rest
of
us
and
that
shortly
after
becoming
king
he
disappears
from
view
his
reign
began
at
one
wednesday
no
thursday
afternoon
and
early
the
next
morning
mercia
was
overrun
by
the
it
is
probable
that
king
wiglaf
was
sold
for
old
silver
to

facing
the
boys
camp
problem
the
time
seemed
to
have
come
to
send
junior
away
to
a
boys
camp
for
the
summer
he
was
getting
too
large
to
have
about
the
house
during
the
hot
weather
and
besides
getting
him
out
of
town
seemed
the
only
way
to
stop
the
radio
concerts
which
had
been
making
a
continuous
chautauqua
of
our
ever
since
march
i
therefore
got
out
a
magazine
and
turned
to
that
section
of
the
advertising
headed
summer
camps
and
schools
there
was
a
staggering
array
judging
from
the
photographs
the
entire
child
population
of
the
united
states
spent
last
summer
in
bathing
suits
or
on
horseback
and
the
pictures
of
them
were
so
generic
and
that
there
was
a
great
temptation
to
spend
the
evening
scrutinizing
them
closely
to
see
if
you
could
pick
out
anyone
you
knew

along

lasting

all
these
are
the
heritage
of
happy
days
at
i
do
think
much
of
the
costumes
they
give
the
boys
to
wear
at
they
look
rather
sissy
to
me
that
because
you
are
looking
at
the
camps
for
girls
dear
said
doris
those
are
girls
in
peter
thompsons
and
bloomers
hurriedly
turning
the
page
i
came
to

do
you
suppose
they
teach
horseshoeing
that
probably
comes
in
the
second
year
for
the
older
boys
said
doris
i
would
want
junior
to
plunge
right
into
horseshoeing
his
first
season
we
must
rush
him
on
the
shores
of
crisco
bay
maine
facing
that
grandest
of
all
oceans
the
atlantic
located
among
the
best
farms
where
fresh
and
wholesome
food
can
be
had
in
abundance
yes
but
it
had
my
dear
that
the
question
anyway
i
do
like
the
looks
of
the
boat
in
the
picture
it
too
full
of
boys
mountain
camp
for

unusual
sports
and
trips
ah
possibly
condor
stalking
that
certainly
would
be
unusual
but
dangerous
i
hate
to
think
of
junior
crawling
about
over
ledges
stalking
condors
and
it
says
here
that
there
is
a
dietitian
and
a
as
well
doris
sniffed
probably
she
thinks
she
knows
how
to
bring
up
children
just
then
junior
came
in
to
announce
that
he
had
signed
up
for
a
job
for
the
summer
working
on
the
farm
of
eddie
westover
uncle
so
in
view
of
this
added
income
i
felt
that
i
could
afford
a
little
vacation
myself

xxiv
all
about
the
silesian
problem
so
much
controversy
has
been
aroused
over
silesia
it
is
high
time
that
the
average
man
in
this
country
had
a
clearer
idea
of
the
problem
at
present
many
people
think
that
if
you
add
oxygen
to
silesia
you
will
get
oxide
of
silesia
and
can
take
spots
out
of
clothes
with
it
a
definite
statement
of
the
whole
upper
silesian
question
is
therefore
due
and
for
those
who
care
to
listen
about
to
be
made
the
trouble
started
at
the
treaty
of
noblitz
in
you
have
no
idea
what
a
perfectly
rotten
treaty
that
was
it
was
negotiated
by
the
grand
duke
ludwig
of
whose
sister
married
a
morrisey
and
settled
in
fall
river
the
aim
and
ambition
of
ludwig
life
was
to
annex
spielzeugingen
to
nichtrauschen
thereby
augmenting
his
duchy
and
at
the
same
time
having
a
dandy
time
and
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
would
stop
at
nothing
when
it
came
time
to
augment
his
duchy
in
this
treaty
then
ludwig
insisted
on
a
clause
making
silesia
a
monogamy
this
was
very
clever
as
it
brought
the
centrist
party
in
silesia
into
direct
conflict
with
the
party
who
wanted
to
restore
the
young
prince
niblick
to
the
throne
thereby
causing
no
end
of
trouble
and
nasty
feeling
with
these
obstacles
out
of
the
way
the
greed
and
ambition
of
ludwig
were
practically
unrestrained
in
fact
some
historians
say
that
they
knew
no
bounds
summoning
the
storkrath
or
common
council
composed
of
three
classes
the
nobles
the
welterweights
and
the
licensed
pilots
he
said
to
them
according
to
taine
an
army
can
travel
ten
days
on
its
stomach
but
who
the
hell
wants
to
be
an
army
this
saying
has
become
a
in
history
and
is
now
remembered
long
after
the
grand
duke
ludwig
has
been
forgotten
but
at
the
time
ludwig
received
nothing
short
of
an
ovation
for
it
and
succeeded
in
winning
over
the
obstructionists
to
his
side
this
made
everyone
in
favor
of
his
disposition
of
silesia
except
the
silesians
and
as
they
could
neither
read
nor
write
they
thought
that
they
still
belonged
to
holland
and
cheered
a
dyke
every
time
they
saw
one
the
question
remained
in
abeyance
therefore
for
a
century
and
a
quarter
then
in
three
years
after
the
accession
of
ralph
rittenhouse
to
the
throne
of
england
the
storm
broke
again
the
occasion
was
the
partition
of
parchesie
by
the
great
powers
by
which
the
towns
of
zweiback
ulmhausen
and
ost
wilp
were
united
to
form
what
is
known
as
the
industrial
triangle
on
the
upper
silesian
border
these
towns
are
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
pumice
district
and
could
alone
supply
france
and
germany
with
pumice
for
fifty
years
provided
it
did
rain
bismarck
once
called
ost
wilp
the
pumice
heart
of
the
world
and
he
was
about
right
too
it
will
therefore
be
seen
how
important
it
was
to
france
that
this
industrial
triangle
on
the
silesian
border
should
belong
to
germany
at
the
conference
which
designated
the
border
line
gambetta
representing
france
insisted
that
the
line
should
follow
the
course
of
the
iser
river
iser
on
one
side
or
the
other
was
the
way
he
is
reported
to
have
phrased
it
which
would
divide
the
pumice
deposits
into
three
areas
the
fourth
being
the
dummy
this
would
never
do
experts
were
called
in
to
see
if
it
might
not
be
possible
to
so
divide
the
district
that
france
might
get
a
quarter
germany
a
quarter
and
england
fifty
cents
it
was
suggested
that
the
line
be
drawn
down
through
to
the
mouth
of
the
iser
as
gambetta
said
the
line
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere
and
it
might
as
well
be
there
but
lord
representing
england
refused
to
concede
the
point
and
for
a
time
it
looked
like
an
open
breach
but
matters
were
smoothed
over
by
the
holding
of
a
plebiscite
in
all
the
towns
of
upper
silesia
the
result
of
this
plebiscite
was
taken
and
exactly
reversed
by
the
council
so
that
the
entire
engadine
valley
was
given
to
sweden
who
did
want
it
anyway
and
there
the
matter
now
stands

of
egging
people
on
to
buy
eliot
five
foot
shelf
of
books
the
publishers
are
resorting
to
an
advertisement
in
which
are
depicted
two
married
couples
one
reading
together
by
the
library
table
the
other
playing
some
game
of
cards
which
is
evidently
boring
them
considerably
the
query
is
which
one
of
these
couples
will
be
the
happier
in
five
years
the
implication
being
that
the
young
people
who
buy
eliot
books
will
by
constant
reading
aloud
to
each
other
from
the
works
of
the
world
best
writers
cement
a
companionship
which
will
put
to
shame
the
illiterate
union
of
the
young
card
players
granted
that
most
games
of
cards
dull
enough
to
result
in
divorce
at
the
end
of
five
years
they
can
not
be
compared
to
family
reading
as
a
system
of
if
this
were
a
betting
periodical
we
would
have
ten
dollars
to
place
on
the
chance
of
the
following
being
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
literary
family
at
the
end
of
the
stated
time
husband
is
reading
his
evening
newspaper
the
wife
appears
bringing
a
volume
from
the
five
foot
shelf
tonight
it
is
origin
of
wife
hurry
up
and
finish
that
paper
we
never
get
along
in
this
darwin
if
we
do
begin
earlier
than
we
did
last
night
husband
well
suppose
we
did
get
along
in
it
that
would
suit
me
all
right
wife
if
you
do
want
me
to
read
it
to
you
just
say
so
if
it
so
far
over
your
head
just
say
so
husband
it
not
over
my
head
at
all
it
just
dull
why
do
you
read
some
more
out
of
that
italian
novel
wife
ugh
i
hate
that
i
suppose
you
rather
have
me
read
the
sheik
husband
the
sheik
go
on
ahead
with
your
darwin
i
listening
wife
it
not
darwin
i
simply
want
to
know
a
little
something
that
all
of
course
know
everything
so
you
do
have
to
read
anything
more
husband
go
on
go
on
wife
that
last
book
we
read
was
so
far
over
husband
go
on
go
on
wife
in
an
injured
tone
one
and
a
half
pages
on
the
selective
processes
of
you
asleep
husband
i
am
not
the
last
words
you
read
were
to
this
conclusion
wife
yes
well
what
were
the
words
before
that
husband
how
should
i
know
i
not
learning
the
thing
to
recite
somewhere
am
i
wife
well
it
very
funny
that
you
did
notice
when
i
read
the
last
sentence
backwards
and
if
you
were
asleep
what
were
you
doing
with
your
eyes
closed
husband
i
got
smoke
in
them
and
was
resting
them
for
a
minute
i
got
a
right
to
rest
my
eyes
a
minute
wife
i
suppose
it
rests
your
eyes
to
breathe
through
your
mouth
and
hold
your
head
way
over
on
one
side
husband
yes
it
does
and
think
of
illustration
if
you
were
asleep
what
were
you
doing
with
your
eyes
closed
wife
go
on
and
read
your
newspaper
that
just
about
your
mental
speed
husband
i
perfectly
willing
to
read
books
in
this
set
if
you
pick
any
decent
ones
wife
yes
you
are
husband
mean
yes
you
are
wife
just
what
i
said
goes
on
for
ten
minutes
and
then
husband
draws
a
revolver
and
kills
his
xxvi
when
not
in
rome
why
do
as
the
romans
did
there
is
a
growing
sentiment
among
sign
painters
that
when
a
sign
or
notice
is
to
be
put
up
in
a
public
place
it
should
be
written
in
characters
that
are
at
least
legible
so
that
to
quote
the
manchester
guardian
as
every
one
seems
to
do
he
who
runs
may
read
this
does
not
strike
one
as
being
an
unseemly
pandering
to
popular
favor
the
supposition
is
that
the
sign
is
put
there
to
be
read
otherwise
it
would
have
been
turned
over
to
an
inmate
of
the
odd
fellows
home
to
be
engraved
on
the
head
of
a
pin
and
what
could
be
a
more
fair
requirement
than
that
it
should
be
readable
advertising
with
its
billboard
message
of
rustless
screens
and
has
done
much
to
further
the
good
cause
and
a
glance
through
the
files
of
newspapers
of
years
ago
when
the
big
news
story
of
the
day
was
played
up
in
diamond
type
easily
deciphered
in
a
strong
light
with
the
naked
eye
shows
that
news
printing
has
not
to
use
a
slang
phrase
stood
still
but
in
the
midst
of
this
uniform
progress
we
find
a
stagnant
spot
surrounded
by
legends
that
are
patent
and
easy
to
read
and
understand
we
find
the
and
the
architect
still
putting
up
tablets
and
cornerstones
monuments
and
cornices
with
dates
disguised
in
roman
numerals
it
is
as
if
it
were
a
game
in
which
they
were
saying
the
number
we
are
thinking
of
is
even
it
begins
with
m
it
has
five
digits
and
when
they
are
spread
out
end
to
end
they
occupy
three
feet
of
space
you
have
until
we
count
to
one
hundred
to
guess
what
it
is
roman
numerals
are
all
right
for
a
rainy
sunday
afternoon
or
to
take
a
convalescent
mind
from
his
illness
but
to
put
them
in
a
public
place
where
the
reader
stands
a
good
chance
of
being
run
over
by
a
dray
if
he
spends
more
than
fifty
seconds
in
their
perusal
is
not
in
keeping
with
the
efficiency
of
the
age
if
for
no
other
reason
than
the
extra
space
they
take
involving
more
marble
more
of
the
cutter
time
and
wear
and
tear
on
his
instruments
not
to
mention
the
big
overhead
you
would
think
that
roman
numerals
would
have
been
abolished
long
ago
of
course
they
can
be
figured
out
if
you
good
at
that
sort
of
thing
by
working
on
your
cuff
and
backs
of
envelopes
you
can
translate
them
in
no
time
at
all
compared
to
the
time
taken
by
a
cocoon
to
change
into
a
butterfly
for
instance
all
you
have
to
do
is
remember
that
m
stands
for
either
meaning
thousand
or
for
million
by
referring
to
the
context
you
can
tell
which
is
more
probable
if
for
example
it
is
a
date
you
can
tell
right
away
that
it
does
mean
million
for
there
is
any
million
in
our
dates
and
there
is
or
eighth
of
your
number
deciphered
already
then
c
of
course
stands
for
which
you
can
translate
by
working
backwards
at
it
taking
such
a
word
as
century
or
per
cent
and
looking
up
what
they
come
from
and
there
you
have
it
by
this
time
it
is
hardly
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
all
you
have
before
you
is
a
combination
of
x
i
and
an
l
the
latter
standing
for
elevated
railway
and
licorice
or
if
you
cross
it
with
two
little
horizontal
lines
it
stands
for
the
english
pound
which
is
equivalent
to
about
four
dollars
and
cents
in
real
money
simple
as
sawing
through
a
log
but
it
takes
time
that
the
big
trouble
with
it
you
ca
do
the
right
thing
by
the
office
and
go
in
for
roman
numerals
too
and
since
most
of
the
people
who
pass
such
inscriptions
are
dependent
on
their
own
earnings
why
not
cater
to
them
a
bit
and
let
them
in
on
the
secret
probably
the
only
reason
that
the
people
have
risen
up
and
demanded
a
reform
along
these
lines
is
because
so
few
of
them
really
give
a
hang
what
the
inscription
says
if
the
american
antiquarian
does
care
about
stating
in
understandable
figures
the
date
on
which
the
cornerstone
of
their
building
was
laid
the
average
citizen
is
perfectly
willing
to
let
the
matter
drop
right
there
but
it
would
never
do
to
revert
to
roman
numerals
in
say
the
arrangement
of
how
long
would
the
commuter
stand
it
if
he
had
to
mumble
to
himself
for
twenty
minutes
and
use
up
the
margins
of
his
newspaper
before
he
could
figure
out
what
was
the
next
train
after
the
or
this

the
telephone
between
wife
and
husband
hello

batting
averages
and
the
standing
of
teams
in

leagues
are
another
department
where
the
introduction
of
roman
numerals
would
be
suicide
for
the
political
party
in
power
at
the
time
for
of
all
things
that
are
essential
to
the
day
work
of
the
voter
an
early
enlightenment
in
the
matter
of
the
home
team
standing
and
the
numerical
progress
of
the
favorite
batsman

of
primary
importance
this

those
who

you
ca
do
right
by
the
office
and
go
in
for
roman
numerals
too
on
matters
such
as
these
the
proletariat
would
have
protested
the
roman
numeral
long
ago
if
they
are
willing
to
let
its
reactionary
use
on
tablets
and
monuments
stand
it
is
because
of
their
indifference
to
influences
which
do
not
directly
affect
their
pocketbooks
but
if
it
could
be
put
up
to
them
in
a
powerful
cartoon
showing
the
architect
and
the
dressed
in
frock
coats
and
silk
hats
with
their
pockets
full
of
money
stepping
on
the
common
people
so
that
he
can
not
see
what
is
written
on
the
tablet
behind
them
then
perhaps
the
public
would
realize
how
they
are
being
imposed
on
for
that
there
is
an
organized
movement
among
architects
and
to
keep
these
things
from
the
citizenry
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
it
is
not
only
a
matter
of
the
roman
numerals
how
about
the
use
of
the
v
when
u
should
be
used
you
will
always
see
it
in
inscriptions
svmner
bvilding
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
perhaps
the
excuse
is
that
v
is
more
adapted
to
then
why
not
carry
this
principle
out
further
why
not
use
the
letter
h
when
s
is
meant
or
substitute
k
for
b
if
the
idea
is
to
deceive
and
to
make
it
easier
for
the
a
pleasing
effect
could
be
got
from
the
inscription
erected
in
by
the
society

making

as
most
inscriptions
xxvii
the
tooth
the
whole
tooth
and
nothing
but
the
tooth
some
saying
it
does
make
much
difference
what
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
everyone
likes
to
talk
about
his
experiences
at
the
dentist
for
years
and
years
little
articles
like
this
have
been
written
on
the
subject
little
jokes
like
some
that
i
shall
presently
make
have
been
made
and
people
in
general
have
been
telling
other
people
just
what
emotions
they
experience
when
they
crawl
into
the
old
red
plush
guillotine
they
like
to
explain
to
each
other
how
they
feel
when
the
dentist
puts
that
buzzer
thing
against
their
bicuspids
and
if
sufficiently
pressed
they
will
describe
their
sensations
on
mouthing
a
rubber
dam
i
tell
you
what
i
hate
they
will
say
with
great
relish
when
he
takes
that
little
and
begins
to
scrape
ugh
oh
i
tell
you
what
worse
than
that
says
the
friend
not
to
be
outdone
when
he
is
poking
around
and
strikes
a
nerve
wow
and
if
there
are
more
than
two
people
at
the
everyone
will
chip
in
and
tell
what
he
or
she
considers
to
be
the
worst
phase
of
the
dentist
work
all
present
enjoying
the
narration
hugely
and
none
so
much
as
the
narrator
who
has
suffered
so
this
sort
of
thing
has
been
going
on
ever
since
the
first
mammoth
gold
tooth
was
hung
out
as
a
bait
to
folks
in
search
of
a
good
time
by
the
way
when
the
present
obnoxious
system
of
dentistry
begin
it
ca
be
so
very
long
ago
that
the
electric
auger
was
invented
and
where
would
a
dentist
be
without
an
electric
auger
yet
you
never
hear
of
amalgam
filling
day
or
any
other
anniversary
in
the
dental
year
there
must
be
a
conspiracy
of
silence
on
the
part
of
the
trade
to
keep
hidden
the
names
of
the
men
who
are
responsible
for
all
this
however
many
years
it
may
be
that
dentists
have
been
plying
their
trade
in
all
that
time
people
have
never
tired
of
talking
about
their
teeth
this
is
probably
due
to
the
inscrutable
workings
of
nature
who
is
always
supplying
new
teeth
to
talk
about
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
actual
time
and
suffering
in
the
chair
is
only
a
fraction
of
the
gross
expenditure
connected
with
the
affair
the
preliminary
period
about
which
nobody
talks
is
much
the
worse
this
dates
from
the
discovery
of
the
wayward
tooth
and
extends
to
the
moment
when
the
dentist
places
his
foot
on
the
automatic
hoist
which
jacks
you
up
into
range
giving
gas
for
is
all
very
humane
in
its
way
but
the
time
for
anaesthetics
is
when
the
patient
first
decides
that
he
must
go
to
the
dentist
from
then
on
until
the
first
excavation
is
started
should
be
shrouded
in
oblivion
there
is
probably
no
moment
more
appalling
than
that
in
which
the
tongue
running
idly
over
the
teeth
in
a
moment
of
play
comes
suddenly
upon
the
ragged
edge
of
a
space
from
which
the
old
familiar
filling
has
disappeared
the
world
stops
and
you
look
meditatively
up
to
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
then
quickly
you
draw
your
tongue
away
and
try
to
laugh
the
affair
off
saying
to
yourself
stuff
and
nonsense
my
good
fellow
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
your
tooth
your
nerves
are
upset
after
a
hard
day
work
that
all
having
decided
this
to
your
satisfaction
you
slyly
and
with
a
poor
attempt
at
being
casual
slide
the
tongue
back
along
the
line
of
adjacent
teeth
hoping
against
hope
that
it
will
reach
the
end
without
mishap
but
there
it
is
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
this
time
the
tooth
simply
has
got
to
be
filled
by
someone
and
the
only
person
who
can
fill
it
with
anything
permanent
is
a
dentist
you
wonder
if
you
might
not
be
able
to
patch
it
up
yourself
for
the
time
being
a
year
or
so
perhaps
with
a
little
and
a
coating
of
it
is
fairly
far
back
and
would
have
to
be
a
very
sightly
job
but
this
has
an
impracticable
sound
even
to
you
you
might
want
to
eat
some
you
never
can
tell
when
someone
might
offer
you
these
days
and
the
while
serviceable
enough
in
the
case
of
cream
soups
and
custards
could
be
expected
to
stand
up
under
heavy
crunching
so
you
admit
that
since
the
thing
has
got
to
be
filled
it
might
as
well
be
a
dentist
who
does
the
job
this
much
decided
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
call
him
up
and
make
an
appointment
let
us
say
that
this
resolve
is
made
on
tuesday
that
afternoon
you
start
to
look
up
the
dentist
number
in
the
a
great
wave
of
relief
sweeps
over
you
when
you
discover
that
it
is
there
how
can
you
be
expected
to
make
an
appointment
with
a
man
who
has
got
a
telephone
and
how
can
you
have
a
tooth
filled
without
making
an
appointment
the
whole
thing
is
impossible
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
god
knows
you
did
your
best
on
wednesday
there
is
a
slightly
more
insistent
twinge
owing
to
bad
management
of
a
sip
of
ice
water
you
decide
that
you
simply
must
get
in
touch
with
that
dentist
when
you
get
back
from
lunch
but
you
know
how
those
things
are
first
one
thing
and
then
another
came
up
and
a
man
came
in
from
providence
who
had
to
be
shown
around
the
office
and
by
the
time
you
had
a
minute
to
yourself
it
was
five
and
anyway
the
tooth
did
bother
you
again
you
would
be
surprised
if
by
being
careful
you
could
get
along
with
it
as
it
is
until
the
end
of
the
week
when
you
will
have
more
time
a
man
has
to
think
of
his
business
after
all
and
what
is
a
little
personal
discomfort
in
the
shape
of
an
unfilled
tooth
to
the
satisfaction
of
work
well
done
in
the
office
by
saturday
morning
you
are
fairly
reconciled
to
going
ahead
but
it
is
only
a
half
day
and
probably
he
has
no
appointments
left
anyway
monday
is
really
the
time
you
can
begin
the
week
afresh
after
all
monday
is
really
the
logical
day
to
start
in
going
to
the
dentist
bright
and
early
monday
morning
you
make
another
try
at
the
and
find
to
your
horror
that
some
time
between
now
and
last
tuesday
the
dentist
name
and
number
have
been
inserted
into
the
directory
there
it
is
there
is
no
getting
around
it
burgess
jas
kendal
dds
courtland
there
is
really
nothing
left
to
do
but
to
call
him
up
fortunately
the
line
is
busy
which
gives
you
a
perfectly
good
excuse
for
putting
it
over
until
tuesday
but
on
tuesday
luck
is
against
you
and
you
get
a
clear
connection
with
the
doctor
himself
an
appointment
is
arranged
for
thursday
afternoon
at
thursday
afternoon
and
here
it
is
only
tuesday
morning
almost
anything
may
happen
between
now
and
then
we
might
declare
war
on
mexico
and
off
you
have
to
go
dentist
appointment
or
no
dentist
appointment
surely
a
man
could
let
a
date
to
have
a
tooth
filled
stand
in
the
way
of
his
doing
his
duty
to
his
country
or
the
social
revolution
might
start
on
wednesday
and
by
thursday
the
whole
town
might
be
in
ashes
you
can
picture
yourself
standing
thursday
afternoon
at
on
the
ruins
of
the
city
hall
fighting
off
marauding
bands
of
reds
and
saying
to
yourself
with
a
sigh
of
relief
only
to
think
at
this
time
i
was
to
have
been
climbing
into
the
dentist
chair
you
never
can
tell
when
your
luck
will
turn
in
a
thing
like
that
but
wednesday
goes
by
and
nothing
happens
and
thursday
morning
dawns
without
even
a
word
from
the
dentist
saying
that
he
has
been
called
suddenly
out
of
town
to
lecture
before
the
incisor
club
apparently
everything
is
working
against
you
by
this
time
your
tongue
has
taken
up
a
permanent
in
the
vacant
tooth
and
is
causing
you
to
talk
indistinctly
and
incoherently
somehow
you
feel
that
if
the
dentist
opens
your
mouth
and
finds
the
tip
of
your
tongue
in
the
tooth
he
will
be
deceived
and
go
away
without
doing
anything
the
only
thing
left
is
for
you
to
call
him
up
and
say
that
you
have
just
killed
a
man
and
are
being
arrested
and
ca
possibly
keep
your
appointment
but
any
dentist
would
see
through
that
he
would
laugh
right
into
his
transmitter
at
you
there
is
probably
no
excuse
which
it
would
be
possible
to
invent
which
a
dentist
has
not
already
heard
eighty
or
ninety
times
no
you
might
as
well
see
the
thing
through
now
luncheon
is
a
ghastly
rite
the
whole
left
side
of
your
jaw
has
suddenly
developed
an
acute
sensitiveness
and
the
disaffection
has
spread
to
the
four
teeth
on
either
side
of
the
original
one
you
doubt
if
it
will
be
possible
for
him
to
touch
it
at
all
perhaps
all
he
intends
to
do
this
time
is
to
look
at
it
anyway
you
might
even
suggest
that
to
him
you
could
very
easily
come
in
again
soon
and
have
him
do
the
actual
work
draws
near
a
horrible
time
of
day
at
best
just
when
a
man
vitality
is
lowest
before
stepping
in
out
of
the
sunlight
into
the
building
in
which
the
dental
parlor
is
you
take
one
look
about
you
at
the
happy
people
scurrying
by
in
the
street
carefree
children
that
they
are
what
do
they
know
of
life
probably
that
man
in
the
hat
never
had
trouble
with
so
much
as
his
there
they
go
pushing
and
jostling
each
other
just
as
if
within
ten
feet
of
them
there
was
not
a
man
who
stands
on
the
brink
of
the
great
misadventure
ah
well
life
is
like
that
into
the
elevator
the
last
hope
is
gone
the
door
clangs
and
you
look
hopelessly
about
you
at
the
stupid
faces
of
your
fellow
passengers
how
can
people
be
so
clownish
of
course
there
is
always
the
chance
that
the
elevator
will
fall
and
that
you
will
all
be
terribly
hurt
but
that
is
too
much
to
expect
you
dismiss
it
from
your
thoughts
as
too
impractical
too
visionary
things
do
work
out
as
happily
as
that
in
real
life
you
feel
a
certain
glow
of
heroic
pride
when
you
tell
the
operator
the
right
floor
number
you
might
just
as
easily
have
told
him
a
floor
too
high
or
too
low
and
that
would
at
least
have
caused
delay
but
after
all
a
man
must
prove
himself
a
man
and
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
meet
fate
with
an
unflinching
eye
and
give
the
right
floor
number
too
often
has
the
scene
in
the
dentist
been
described
for
me
to
try
to
do
it
again
here
they
are
all
alike
the
antiseptic
smell
the
ominous
hum
from
the
the
literary
digests
and
the
silent
sullen
group
of
waiting
patients
each
trying
to
look
unconcerned
and
cordially
disliking
everyone
else
in
the
room
all
these
have
been
sung
by
poets
of
far
greater
lyric
powers
than
mine
not
that
i
really
think
that
they
greater
than
mine
but
the
customary
form
of
excuse
for
not
writing
something
you
have
got
time
or
space
to
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
i
could
do
it
much
better
than
it
has
ever
been
done
before
i
can
only
say
that
as
you
sit
looking
with
unseeing
eyes
through
a
large
book
entitled
the
great
war
in
pictures
you
would
gladly
change
places
with
the
most
lowly
of
god
creatures
it
is
inconceivable
that
there
should
be
anyone
worse
off
than
you
unless
perhaps
it
is
some
of
the
poor
wretches
who
are
waiting
with
you
that
one
over
in
the
nervously
tearing
to
shreds
a
copy
of
the
dental
review
and
practical
inlay
worker
she
may
have
something
frightful
the
trouble
with
her
she
could
possibly
look
more
worried
perhaps
it
is
very
very
painful
this
thought
cheers
you
up
considerably
what
cowards
women
are
in
times
like
these
and
then
there
comes
the
sound
of
voices
from
the
next
room
all
right
doctor
and
if
it
gives
me
any
more
pain
shall
i
call
you
up
do
you
think
that
it
will
bleed
much
more
saturday
morning
then
at
eleven
good
bye
doctor
and
a
woman
emerges
all
women
are
when
emerging
from
the
dentist
office
looking
as
if
she
were
playing
the
big
emotional
scene
in
john
ferguson
a
wisp
of
hair
waves
dissolutely
across
her
forehead
between
her
eyes
her
face
is
pale
except
for
a
slight
inflammation
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
in
her
eyes
is
that
look
of
one
who
has
been
face
to
face
with
life
but
she
is
through
she
should
care
how
she
looks
illustration
you
would
gladly
change
places
with
the
most
lawless
of
god
creatures
the
nurse
appears
and
looks
inquiringly
at
each
one
in
the
room
each
one
in
the
room
evades
the
nurse
glance
in
one
last
futile
attempt
to
fool
someone
and
get
away
without
seeing
the
dentist
but
she
spots
you
and
nods
pleasantly
god
how
pleasantly
she
nods
there
ought
to
be
a
law
against
people
being
as
pleasant
as
that
the
doctor
will
see
you
now
she
says
the
english
language
may
hold
a
more
disagreeable
combination
of
words
than
the
doctor
will
see
you
now
i
am
willing
to
concede
something
to
the
phrase
have
you
anything
to
say
before
the
current
is
turned
on
that
may
be
worse
for
the
moment
but
it
does
last
so
long
for
continued
unmitigating
depression
i
know
nothing
to
equal
the
doctor
will
see
you
now
but
i
not
about
it
i
willing
to
consider
other
possibilities
smiling
feebly
you
trip
over
the
extended
feet
of
the
man
next
to
you
and
stagger
into
the
where
amid
a
ghastly
array
of
of
teeth
blue
flames
waving
eerily
from
bunsen
burners
and
the
drowning
sound
of
perpetually
running
water
which
chokes
and
gurgles
at
intervals
you
sink
into
the
chair
and
close
your
eyes
but
now
let
us
consider
the
spiritual
exaltation
that
comes
when
you
are
at
last
let
down
and
turned
loose
it
is
all
over
and
what
did
it
amount
to
why
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
you
suddenly
develop
a
particular
friendship
for
the
dentist
a
splendid
fellow
really
you
ask
him
questions
about
his
instruments
what
does
he
use
this
thing
for
for
instance
well
well
to
think
of
a
little
thing
like
that
making
all
that
trouble
and
the
dentist
family
how
are
they
is
that
fine
gaily
you
shake
hands
with
him
and
straighten
your
tie
forgotten
is
the
fact
that
you
have
another
appointment
with
him
for
monday
there
is
no
such
thing
as
monday
you
are
through
for
today
and
all
right
with
the
world
as
you
pass
out
through
the
you
leer
at
the
others
unpleasantly
the
poor
fishes
why
ca
they
take
their
medicine
like
grown
people
and
not
sit
there
moping
as
if
they
were
going
to
be
shot
here
the
a
charming
fellow
you
wonder
if
he
knows
that
you
have
just
had
a
tooth
filled
you
feel
tempted
to
tell
him
and
slap
him
on
the
back
you
feel
tempted
to
tell
everyone
out
in
the
bright
cheery
street
and
what
a
wonderful
street
it
is
too
all
full
of
nice
black
snow
and
water
after
all
life
is
sweet
and
then
you
go
and
find
the
first
person
whom
you
can
accost
without
being
arrested
and
explain
to
him
just
what
it
was
that
the
dentist
did
to
you
and
how
you
felt
and
what
you
have
got
to
have
done
next
time
which
brings
us
right
back
to
where
we
were
in
the
beginning
and
perhaps
accounts
for
everyone
liking
to
divulge
their
dental
secrets
to
others
it
may
be
a
sort
of
hysterical
relief
that
for
the
time
being
it
is
all
over
with
xxviii
malignant
mirrors
as
a
rule
i
try
not
to
look
into
mirrors
any
more
than
is
absolutely
necessary
things
are
depressing
enough
as
they
are
without
my
going
out
of
my
way
to
make
myself
miserable
but
every
once
in
a
while
it
is
unavoidable
there
are
certain
mirrors
in
town
with
which
i
am
brought
face
to
face
on
occasion
and
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
make
the
best
of
it
i
have
come
to
classify
them
according
to
the
harshness
with
which
they
fling
the
truth
into
my
face
i
am
unquestionably
at
my
worst
in
the
mirror
before
which
i
try
on
hats
i
may
have
been
going
along
all
winter
thinking
of
other
things
dwelling
on
what
people
tell
me
is
really
a
splendid
spiritual
side
to
my
nature
thinking
of
myself
as
rather
a
fine
sort
of
person
not
dashing
perhaps
but
one
from
whose
countenance
shines
a
great
light
of
honesty
and
courage
which
is
even
more
to
be
desired
than
physical
beauty
i
rather
imagine
that
little
children
on
the
street
and
grizzled
supreme
court
justices
out
for
a
walk
turn
as
i
pass
and
say
a
fine
face
plain
but
fine
then
i
go
in
to
buy
a
hat
the
mirror
in
the
hat
store
is
triplicate
so
that
you
see
yourself
not
only
but
from
each
side
the
appearance
that
i
present
to
myself
in
this
mirror
is
that
of
three
photographs
showing
all
possible
approaches
to
the
face
of
harry
duchamps
alias
harry
duval
alias
harry
duffy
wanted
in
rochester
for
the
murder
of
nettie
lubitch
age
all
that
is
missing
is
the
longitudinal
scar
across
the
right
cheek
i
have
never
seen
a
meaner
face
than
mine
is
in
the
mirror
i
could
stand
its
not
being
handsome
i
could
even
stand
looking
weak
in
an
attractive
sort
of
way
but
in
the
right
hand
mirror
there
confronts
me
a
face
the
face
of
a
yellow
craven
while
at
the
left
leers
an
even
more
repulsive
type
sensual
and
cruel
furthermore
even
though
i
have
had
a
that
very
day
there
is
an
unkempt
fringe
showing
over
my
collar
in
back
and
the
collar
itself
a
wimpet
which
looked
so
well
on
the
young
man
in
the
seems
to
be
something
that
would
be
worn
by
a
maine
guide
when
he
goes
into
portland
for
the
day
my
suit
needs
pressing
and
there
is
a
general
air
of
its
having
been
given
to
me
with
ten
dollars
by
the
state
on
my
departure
from
sing
sing
the
day
before
but
for
an
unfavorable
view
nothing
can
compare
with
the
one
that
i
get
of
myself
as
i
pass
the
on
the
corner
they
have
a
mirror
in
the
window
so
set
that
it
catches
the
reflection
of
people
as
they
step
up
on
the
curb
when
there
are
other
forms
in
the
picture
it
is
not
always
easy
to
identify
yourself
at
first
especially
at
a
distance
and
every
morning
on
my
way
to
work
unless
i
deliberately
avert
my
face
i
am
mortified
to
discover
that
the
man
with
the
rather
effeminate
swinging
gait
whom
i
see
mincing
along
through
the
crowd
is
none
other
than
myself
illustration
i
am
mortified
to
discover
that
the
unpleasant
looking
man
is
none
other
than
myself
the
only
good
mirror
in
the
list
is
the
one
in
the
elevator
of
my
there
is
a
subdued
light
in
the
car
a
sort
of
golden
glow
which
softens
and
idealizes
and
the
mirror
shows
only
a
length
making
it
impossible
to
see
how
badly
the
cuffs
on
my
trousers
bag
over
the
tops
of
my
shoes
here
i
become
myself
again
i
have
even
thought
that
i
might
be
handsome
if
i
paid
as
much
attention
to
my
looks
as
some
men
do
in
this
mirror
my
clothes
look
for
the
last
time
as
similar
clothes
look
on
men
a
hat
which
is
in
every
respect
perfect
when
seen
here
immediately
becomes
a
senatorial
sombrero
when
i
step
out
into
the
street
but
for
the
brief
space
of
time
while
i
am
in
that
elevator
i
am
the
splendid
figure
of
a
man
that
the
original
called
for
i
wonder
if
it
takes
much
experience
to
run
an
elevator
for
if
it
does
i
would
like
to
make
my
running
that
car
with
the
magic
mirror
xxix
the
power
of
the
press
the
police
commissioner
of
new
york
city
explains
the
wave
of
crime
in
that
city
by
blaming
the
newspapers
the
newspapers
he
says
are
constantly
printing
accounts
of
robberies
and
murders
and
these
accounts
simply
encourage
other
criminals
to
come
to
new
york
and
do
the
same
if
the
papers
would
stop
giving
all
this
publicity
to
crime
the
crooks
might
forget
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
it
is
they
read
about
it
in
their
newspapers
every
morning
and
sooner
or
later
have
to
go
out
and
try
it
for
themselves
this
is
a
terrible
thought
but
suggests
a
convenient
alibi
for
other
errant
citizens
thus
we
may
read
the
following
news
notes
benjamin
gleam
age
of
ruby
avenue
the
bronx
was
arrested
last
night
for
appearing
in
the
late
byzantine
room
of
the
museum
of
fine
arts
clad
only
in
a
suit
of
underwear
when
questioned
gleam
said
that
he
had
seen
so
many
pictures
in
the
newspaper
advertisements
of
respectable
men
and
women
going
about
in
their
underwear
drinking
tea
jumping
hurdles
and
holding
family
reunions
that
he
simply
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
had
to
try
it
for
himself
the
newspapers
did
it
he
is
quoted
as
saying
leonia
eggcup
who
was
arrested
yesterday
on
the
charge
of
bigamy
issued
a
statement
today
through
her
attorneys
wine
women
and
song
i
am
charged
with
having
eleven
husbands
all
living
in
various
parts
of
the
united
states
reads
the
statement
this
charge
is
correct
but
before
i
pay
the
extreme
penalty
i
want
to
have
the
public
understand
that
i
am
not
to
blame
it
is
the
fault
of
the
press
of
this
country
day
after
day
i
read
the
list
of
marriages
in
my
morning
paper
day
after
day
i
saw
people
after
people
getting
married
finally
the
thing
got
into
my
blood
and
although
i
was
married
at
the
time
i
felt
that
i
simply
had
to
be
married
again
then
no
sooner
would
i
become
settled
in
my
new
home
than
the
constant
incitement
to
further
matrimonial
ventures
would
come
through
the
columns
of
the
daily
press
i
fell
it
is
true
but
if
there
is
any
justice
in
this
land
it
will
be
the
newspapers
and
not
i
who
will
suffer
xxx
home
for
the
holidays
as
a
pretty
tribute
to
that
element
of
our
population
which
is
under
years
of
age
these
are
called
the
holidays
this
is
the
only
chance
that
the
janitors
of
the
schools
and
colleges
have
to
soak
the
floors
of
the
recitation
halls
with
oil
to
catch
the
dust
of
the
next
semester
and
while
this
is
being
done
there
is
nothing
to
do
with
the
students
but
to
send
them
home
for
a
week
or
two
thus
it
happened
that
the
term
holidays
is
applied
to
that
period
of
the
year
when
everybody
else
is
working
just
twice
as
hard
and
twice
as
long
during
the
week
to
make
up
for
that
precious
day
which
must
be
lost
to
the
sales
campaign
or
the
record
output
on
christmas
day
for
those
who
are
home
from
school
and
college
it
is
called
in
the
catalogues
of
their
institutions
a
recess
or
vacation
and
the
general
impression
is
allowed
to
get
abroad
among
the
parents
that
it
is
to
be
a
period
of
rest
and
recuperation
arthur
and
alice
have
been
working
so
hard
at
school
or
college
that
two
weeks
of
good
quiet
and
home
cooking
will
put
them
right
on
their
feet
again
ready
to
pitch
into
that
chemistry
course
in
which
owing
to
an
incompetent
instructor
they
did
not
do
very
well
last
term
that
the
theory
of
rest
during
vacation
is
fallacious
can
be
proved
by
hiding
in
the
coat
closet
of
the
home
of
any
college
or
school
youth
home
for
christmas
recess
admission
to
the
coat
closet
may
be
forced
by
making
yourself
out
to
be
a
government
official
or
an
inspector
of
gas
meters
once
hidden
among
the
overshoes
you
will
overhear
the
following
little
earnest
drama
entitled
home
for
the
holidays
there
was
a
banging
of
the
front
door
and
edgar
has
arrived
a
round
of
kisses
an
exchange
of
health
reports
and
edgar
is
bounding
upstairs
dinner
in
half
an
hour
says
mother
sorry
shouts
edgar
from
the
but
i
got
to
go
out
to
the
whortleberry
to
a
dinner
dance
got
the
bid
last
week
say
have
i
got
any
at
home
here
mine
are
in
my
trunk
father
studs
are
requisitioned
and
the
family
cluster
at
edgar
door
to
slide
in
a
few
conversational
phrases
while
he
is
getting
the
best
of
his
dress
shirt
how
have
you
been
three
guesses
as
to
who
it
is
that
asks
this
oh
all
right
say
have
i
got
any
pumps
at
home
mine
are
in
the
trunk
where
are
those
old
ones
i
had
last
summer
do
you
want
me
to
tie
your
tie
for
you
two
guesses
as
to
who
it
is
that
asks
this
no
thanks
can
i
get
my
laundry
done
by
tomorrow
night
i
got
to
go
out
to
the
clamps
at
short
neck
for
over
the
to
a
party
and
when
i
get
back
from
there
dibble
is
giving
a
dinner
and
theatre
party
do
you
want
to
eat
a
little
dinner
here
before
you
go
to
the
whortleberry
one
guess
as
to
who
it
is
that
asks
this
but
edgar
has
bounded
down
the
stairs
and
left
the
family
to
comfort
each
other
with
such
observations
as
he
looks
tired
i
think
that
he
has
filled
out
a
little
or
i
wonder
if
he
studying
too
hard
you
might
stay
in
the
for
the
entire
two
weeks
and
not
hear
much
more
of
edgar
than
this
his
parents
do
they
catch
him
as
he
is
going
up
and
down
stairs
and
while
he
is
putting
the
studs
into
his
shirt
and
are
thankful
for
that
they
really
get
into
closer
touch
with
him
while
he
is
at
college
for
he
writes
them
a
weekly
letter
then
as
this
sort
of
life
is
to
the
youth
who
is
supposed
to
be
resting
during
his
vacation
it
might
be
even
more
wearing
if
he
were
to
stay
within
the
family
precincts
once
in
a
while
one
of
the
parties
for
which
he
has
been
signed
up
falls
through
and
he
is
forced
to
spend
the
evening
at
home
at
first
it
is
somewhat
embarrassing
to
be
thrown
in
with
strangers
for
a
meal
like
that
but
as
the
evening
wears
on
the
ice
is
broken
and
things
assume
a
more
easy
swing
the
family
begins
to
make
remarks
you
must
stand
up
straighter
my
boy
says
father
placing
his
hand
between
edgar
you
are
slouching
badly
i
noticed
it
as
you
walked
down
the
street
this
morning
do
all
the
boys
wear
shirts
like
that
asks
mother
personally
i
think
that
they
look
very
untidy
they
are
all
right
for
tennis
and
things
like
that
but
i
wish
you
put
on
a
starched
collar
when
you
are
in
the
house
you
never
see
elmer
quiggly
wearing
a
collar
like
that
he
always
looks
neat
for
heaven
sake
eddie
says
sister
take
off
that
tie
you
certainly
do
get
the
most
things
to
put
around
your
neck
it
looks
like
a
masonic
apron
let
me
go
with
you
when
you
buy
your
next
batch
by
this
time
edgar
has
his
back
against
the
wall
and
is
breathing
hard
what
do
these
folks
know
of
what
is
being
done
if
it
is
not
family
heckling
it
may
be
that
even
more
insidious
trial
the
third
degree
this
is
usually
inflicted
by
and
neighbors
the
formulæ
are
something
like
this
well
how
do
you
like
your
school
i
suppose
you
have
plenty
of
time
for
pranks
eh
what
a
good
time
you
boys
must
have
it
is
so
much
what
you
get
out
of
books
that
will
help
you
in
after
life
i
have
found
but
the
friendships
made
in
college
meeting
so
many
boys
from
all
parts
of
the
country
why
it
a
liberal
education
in
itself
what
was
the
matter
with
the
football
team
this
season
let
see
how
many
more
years
have
you
what
only
one
more
well
well
and
i
can
remember
you
when
you
were
that
high
and
used
to
come
over
to
my
house
wearing
a
little
green
dress
with
big
buttons
you
certainly
were
a
cute
little
boy
and
used
to
call
our
cook
and
here
you
are
almost
a
senior
illustration
i
can
remember
you
when
you
were
that
high
oh
are
you
i
wonder
if
you
know
a
fellow
named
er
mellish
spencer
mellish
i
met
him
at
the
beach
last
summer
i
am
pretty
sure
that
he
is
in
your
class
well
no
maybe
it
was
after
an
hour
or
two
of
this
edgar
is
willing
to
go
back
to
college
and
take
an
extra
course
in
blacksmithing
chipping
and
filing
given
during
the
christmas
vacation
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
getting
caught
again
and
whichever
way
you
look
at
it
whether
he
spends
his
time
getting
into
and
out
of
his
evening
clothes
or
goes
crazy
answering
questions
and
defending
his
mode
of
dress
it
all
adds
up
to
the
same
in
the
end
fatigue
and
depletion
and
what
the
doctor
would
call
a
general
nervous
condition
the
younger
you
are
the
more
frayed
you
get
little
wilbur
comes
home
from
school
where
he
has
been
put
to
bed
at
every
night
with
the
rest
of
the
fifth
form
boys
and
has
had
to
brush
his
hair
in
the
presence
of
the
wife
and
dives
into
what
might
be
called
a
veritable
maelstrom
of
activity
from
a
diet
of
cereal
and
he
is
turned
loose
in
the
butler
pantry
among
the
maraschino
cherries
and
given
a
free
rein
at
the
various
parties
where
individual
santas
and
brandied
walnuts
are
followed
by
an
afternoon
at
treasure
island
with
the
result
that
he
comes
home
and
insists
on
tipping
every
one
in
the
family
the
black
spot
and
breaks
the
cheval
glass
when
he
is
denied
going
to
the
bicycle
race
at
two
in
the
morning
little
girls
do
practically
the
same
and
if
they
are
over
fourteen
go
back
to
school
with
the
added
burden
of
an
de
contracted
during
the
recess
in
general
it
takes
about
a
month
or
two
of
good
hard
schooling
and
overstudy
to
put
the
child
back
on
its
feet
after
the
christmas
rest
at
home
which
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
our
educational
system
is
all
wrong
it
is
obvious
that
the
child
should
be
kept
at
home
for
eight
months
out
of
the
year
and
sent
to
school
for
the
vacations
xxxi
how
to
understand
international
finance
it
is
high
time
that
someone
came
out
with
a
clear
statement
of
the
international
financial
situation
for
weeks
and
weeks
officials
have
been
rushing
about
holding
conferences
and
councils
and
having
their
pictures
taken
going
up
and
down
the
steps
of
buildings
then
after
each
conference
the
newspapers
have
printed
a
lot
of
figures
showing
the
latest
returns
on
how
much
germany
owes
the
bank
and
none
of
it
means
anything
now
there
is
a
certain
principle
which
has
to
be
followed
in
all
financial
discussions
involving
sums
over
one
hundred
dollars
there
is
probably
not
more
than
one
hundred
dollars
in
actual
cash
in
circulation
today
that
is
if
you
were
to
call
in
all
the
bills
and
silver
and
gold
in
the
country
at
noon
tomorrow
and
pile
them
up
on
the
table
you
would
find
that
you
had
just
about
one
hundred
dollars
with
perhaps
several
canadian
pennies
and
a
few
peppermint
all
the
rest
of
the
money
you
hear
about
does
exist
it
is
when
you
hear
of
a
transaction
involving
it
means
that
one
firm
wrote
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
gave
it
to
another
firm
and
the
other
firm
took
it
home
and
said
look
momma
i
got
but
when
momma
asked
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
out
of
it
to
pay
the
man
who
washed
the
windows
the
answer
probably
was
that
the
firm
had
got
more
than
seventy
cents
in
cash
this
is
the
principle
of
finance
so
long
as
you
can
pronounce
any
number
above
a
thousand
you
have
got
that
much
money
you
ca
work
this
scheme
with
the
man
or
the
but
it
goes
big
on
wall
or
in
international
financial
circles
this
much
understood
we
see
that
when
the
allies
demand
gold
marks
from
germany
they
know
very
well
that
nobody
in
germany
has
ever
seen
gold
marks
and
never
will
a
more
surprised
and
disappointed
lot
of
boys
you
could
ask
to
see
than
the
supreme
financial
council
would
be
if
germany
were
actually
to
send
them
a
for
the
full
amount
demanded
what
they
mean
is
that
taken
all
in
all
germany
owes
the
world
gold
marks
plus
carfare
this
includes
everything
breakage
meals
sent
to
room
good
will
everything
now
it
is
understood
that
if
they
really
meant
this
germany
could
even
draw
cards
so
the
principle
on
which
the
thing
is
figured
out
is
as
follows
watch
this
closely
there
is
a
trick
in
it
you
put
down
a
lot
of
figures
like
this
any
figures
will
do
so
long
as
you
ca
read
them
quickly
gold
marks
on
a
current
value
basis
on
reparation
account
plus
yearly
tax
on
german
exports
gold
fish
amusement
tax
miles
diameter
of
the
sun
then
you
add
them
together
and
subtract
the
number
you
first
thought
of
this
leaves
and
the
card
you
hold
in
your
hand
is
the
seven
of
diamonds

i
right
xxxii
the
night
before
summer
imaginary
with
the
weather
it
was
on
the
night
of
june
we
were
seated
in
the
office
of
the
weather
bureau
on
the
floor
of
the
whitehall
building
the
weather
man
and
i
and
we
were
waiting
for
summer
to
come
it
was
officially
due
on
june
we
had
the
almanac
word
for
it
and
years
and
years
of
precedent
but
still
the
weather
man
was
skeptical
it
had
been
a
hard
spring
for
the
weather
man
day
after
day
he
had
been
forced
to
run
a
signed
statement
in
the
daily
papers
to
the
effect
that
some
time
during
that
day
there
would
probably
be
showers
and
day
after
day
with
a
ghastly
consistency
his
prophecy
had
come
true
people
had
come
to
dislike
him
personally
old
jokes
about
him
were
brought
out
and
oiled
and
given
a
trial
spin
down
the
road
a
piece
before
appearing
in
funny
columns
and
vaudeville
skits
and
the
sporting
writers
frenzied
by
the
task
of
filling
their
space
with
nothing
but
tables
of
batting
averages
had
become
positively
libellous
and
now
summer
was
at
hand
and
with
it
the
promise
of
the
sun
the
weather
man
nibbled
at
his
thumb
nail
the
clock
on
the
wall
said
it
just
could
go
back
on
us
now
he
said
plaintively
when
it
means
so
much
to
us
it
always
come
on
the
there
was
not
much
that
i
could
say
i
did
want
to
hold
out
any
false
hope
for
i
am
a
child
in
arms
in
matters
of
astronomy
or
whatever
it
is
that
makes
weather
i
often
remember
hearing
my
father
tell
i
ventured
how
every
year
on
the
of
june
summer
always
used
to
come
rain
or
shine
until
they
came
to
look
for
it
on
that
date
and
to
count
from
then
as
the
beginning
of
the
season
it
seems
as
if
i
know
he
interrupted
but
there
have
been
so
many
upsetting
things
during
the
past
twelve
months
we
ca
check
up
this
year
by
any
other
years
all
we
can
do
is
wait
and
see
a
gust
of
wind
from
jersey
ran
along
the
side
of
the
building
shaking
at
the
windows
the
weather
man
shuddered
and
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
which
stood
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
indicated
whatever
anemometers
do
indicate
when
they
want
to
register
bad
news
i
considerately
looked
out
at
the
window
you
no
idea
he
said
at
last
in
a
low
voice
of
how
this
last
rainy
spell
has
affected
my
home
life
for
the
first
two
or
three
days
although
i
got
dark
looks
from
slight
acquaintances
there
was
always
a
cheery
welcome
waiting
for
me
when
i
got
home
and
the
little
woman
would
say
mind
ray
it
will
soon
be
pleasant
and
we
all
know
that
it
not
your
fault
anyway
but
then
after
a
week
had
passed
and
there
had
been
nothing
but
rain
and
showers
and
rain
i
began
to
notice
a
change
when
i
would
swing
in
at
the
gate
she
would
meet
me
and
say
in
a
voice
what
is
it
for
and
i
would
have
to
say
cloudy
with
occasional
showers
and
light
easterly
gales
at
which
she
would
turn
away
and
bite
her
lip
and
once
i
thought
i
saw
her
wet
then
one
night
the
break
came
it
had
started
out
to
be
a
perfect
day
just
such
as
one
reads
about
but
along
about
noon
it
began
to
cloud
over
and
soon
the
rain
poured
down
in
illustration
she
would
turn
away
and
bite
her
lip
i
was
all
discouraged
and
as
i
wrote
out
the
forecast
for
the
papers
and
friday
i
felt
like
giving
the
whole
thing
up
and
going
back
to
vermont
to
live
when
i
got
home
alice
was
there
with
her
things
on
waiting
for
me
need
tell
me
what
it
going
to
be
she
sobbed
know
every
one
knows
the
whole
world
knows
i
used
to
think
that
it
was
your
fault
but
when
the
children
come
home
from
school
crying
because
they
have
been
plagued
for
being
the
weather
man
children
when
every
time
i
go
out
i
know
that
the
neighbors
are
talking
behind
my
back
and
saying
how
does
she
stand
it
when
every
paper
i
read
every
bulletin
i
see
stares
me
in
the
face
with
great
letters
saying
weather
man
predicts
more
rain
or
lynch
the
weather
man
and
let
the
baseball
season
go
on
then
i
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
come
to
an
understanding
i
am
going
over
to
mother
until
you
can
do
better
the
weather
man
got
up
and
went
to
the
window
out
there
over
the
battery
there
was
a
spot
casting
a
sickly
glow
through
the
which
filled
the
sky
that
the
moon
up
there
behind
the
fog
he
said
and
laughed
a
bitter
cackle
it
was
now
the
thermograph
was
writing
busily
in
red
ink
on
the
little
diagrammed
cuff
provided
for
that
purpose
writing
all
about
the
temperature
the
weather
man
inspected
the
fine
jagged
line
as
it
leaked
out
of
the
pen
on
the
chart
then
he
walked
over
to
the
window
again
and
stood
looking
out
over
the
bay
you
think
that
people
would
have
a
little
gratitude
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
not
hit
at
a
man
who
has
done
so
much
for
them
if
it
were
for
me
where
would
the
art
of
american
conversation
be
if
there
were
no
weather
to
talk
about
how
could
there
be
any
dinner
parties
or
church
sociables
or
sidewalk
chats
all
i
have
to
do
is
put
out
a
real
scorcher
or
a
continued
cold
snap
and
i
can
drive
off
the
boards
the
biggest
news
story
that
was
ever
launched
or
draw
the
teeth
out
of
the
most
delicate
international
situation
i
have
saved
more
reputations
and
social
functions
than
any
other
influence
in
american
life
and
yet
here
when
the
home
office
sends
me
a
rummy
lot
of
weather
over
which
i
have
no
control
everybody
jumps
on
me
he
pulled
savagely
at
the
window
shade
and
pressed
his
nose
against
the
pane
in
silence
for
a
while
there
was
no
sound
but
the
ticking
of
the
anemometer
and
the
steady
scratching
of
the
thermograph
i
looked
at
the
clock
suddenly
the
telegraph
over
in
the
corner
snapped
like
a
bunch
of
firecrackers
in
a
second
the
weather
man
was
at
its
side
taking
down
the
message
new
orleans
la
nhrufkyotldmrelpwzwotudk
heavy
precipitation
south
westerly
gales
letter
follows
new
orleans
u
s
weather
bureau
poor
fellow
muttered
the
weather
man
who
even
in
his
own
tense
excitement
did
not
forget
the
troubles
of
his
brother
weather
prophet
in
new
orleans
i
know
just
how
he
feels
i
hope
he
not
married
he
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
in
four
minutes
summer
would
be
due
and
with
summer
a
clearer
sky
renewed
friendships
and
a
united
family
for
the
weather
man
if
it
failed
him
i
dreaded
to
think
of
what
might
happen
it
was
floors
to
the
pavement
below
and
i
am
not
a
powerful
man
physically
together
we
sat
at
the
table
by
the
thermograph
and
watched
the
red
line
draw
mountain
ranges
along
the
degree
line
from
our
seats
we
could
look
out
over
the
statue
of
liberty
and
see
the
glow
which
told
of
a
censored
moon
the
weather
man
was
making
nervous
little
pokes
at
his
collar
as
if
it
had
a
rough
edge
that
was
cutting
his
neck
suddenly
he
gripped
the
table
somewhere
a
clock
was
beginning
to
strike
twelve
i
shut
my
eyes
and
waited
look
newspaper
man
look
he
shrieked
and
grabbed
me
by
the
tie
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
at
the
thermograph
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
the
red
line
had
given
a
little
final
quaver
on
the
degree
line
and
then
had
shot
up
like
a
rocket
until
it
struck
degrees
and
lay
there
trembling
and
heaving
like
a
runner
after
a
race
but
it
was
not
at
this
that
the
weather
man
was
pointing
there
out
in
the
murky
sky
the
stroke
of
twelve
had
ripped
apart
the
clouds
and
a
large
moon
was
fairly
crashing
its
way
through
laying
out
a
course
of
silver
cinders
across
the
harbor
and
in
all
parts
of
the
heavens
stars
were
breaking
out
like
a
rash
in
two
minutes
it
had
become
a
balmy
languorous
night
summer
had
come
i
turned
to
the
weather
man
he
was
wiping
the
palms
of
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
looking
foolishly
happy
i
said
nothing
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
said
before
we
left
the
office
he
stopped
to
write
out
the
prophecy
for
wednesday
june
the
first
day
of
summer
fair
and
warmer
with
slowly
rising
temperatur
his
hand
trembled
so
as
he
wrote
that
he
forgot
the
final
e
then
we
went
out
and
he
turned
toward
his
home
on
wednesday
june
it
rained
xxxiii
welcome
home
and
shut
up
there
are
a
few
weeks
which
bid
fair
to
be
pretty
trying
ones
in
our
national
life
they
will
mark
the
return
to
the
city
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
vacationists
after
two
months
or
two
weeks
of
feverish
recuperation
and
there
is
probably
no
more
obnoxious
class
of
citizen
taken
end
for
end
than
the
returning
vacationist
in
the
first
place
they
are
all
so
offensively
healthy
they
come
crashing
through
the
all
brown
and
peeling
as
if
their
health
were
something
they
had
acquired
through
some
particular
credit
to
themselves
if
it
were
possible
some
of
them
would
wear
their
noses
on
their
like
phi
beta
kappa
keys
they
have
got
so
used
to
going
about
all
summer
in
bathing
suits
and
shirts
open
at
the
neck
that
they
look
like
professional
wrestlers
in
stiff
collars
and
seem
to
be
on
the
point
of
bursting
out
at
any
minute
and
they
always
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
getting
off
the
train
where
bessie
they
scream
ned
where
bessie
have
you
got
the
thermos
bottles
well
here
the
old
station
just
as
it
was
when
we
left
it
hysterical
laughter
wallace
you
simply
must
carry
your
pail
and
shovel
mamma
ca
carry
you
know
mamma
told
you
that
if
you
wanted
to
bring
your
pail
and
shovel
home
you
would
have
to
carry
it
yourself
do
you
remember
mamma
told
you
that
wallace
wallace
listen
edna
have
you
got
bessie
gone
after
the
trunks
at
least
he
that
was
where
he
was
going
look
there
the
dexter
building
looking
just
the
same
big
as
life
and
twice
as
natural
i
know
wallace
mamma
just
as
hot
as
you
are
but
you
do
hear
mamma
crying
do
you
i
wonder
where
bert
is
he
said
he
be
down
to
meet
us
sure
here
give
me
that
cape
lillian
you
dragging
it
all
over
the
ground
bert
here
we
are
spencer
there
daddy
daddy
junior
wipe
that
gum
off
your
shoe
this
minute
and
so
they
go
all
the
way
out
into
the
street
and
the
cab
and
home
millions
of
them
it
terrible
and
when
they
get
home
things
are
just
about
as
bad
except
there
so
many
people
to
see
them
at
the
sight
of
eight
sunday
and
daily
papers
strewn
over
the
front
porch
and
lawn
there
are
loud
screams
of
imprecation
at
daddy
for
having
forgotten
to
order
them
stopped
daddy
insists
that
he
did
order
them
stopped
and
that
it
is
that
damn
fool
boy
i
guess
you
were
home
much
during
july
says
mamma
bitterly
or
you
would
have
noticed
that
something
was
wrong
daddy
did
join
the
family
until
august
there
were
no
papers
delivered
during
july
says
daddy
very
firmly
and
quietly
at
least
i
did
see
any
stepping
on
one
dated
july
the
inside
of
the
house
resembles
some
place
you
might
bet
a
man
a
hundred
dollars
he
dare
spend
the
night
in
dead
men
feet
seem
to
be
protruding
from
behind
sofas
and
there
is
a
damp
smell
as
if
the
rooms
had
been
closed
pending
the
arrival
of
the
coroner
junior
runs
upstairs
to
see
if
his
switching
engine
is
where
he
left
it
and
comes
falling
down
stairs
panting
with
terror
announcing
that
there
is
something
in
the
at
that
moment
there
is
a
sound
of
someone
leaving
the
house
by
the
back
door
daddy
is
elected
by
popular
vote
to
go
upstairs
and
see
what
has
happened
although
he
insists
that
he
has
to
wait
down
stairs
as
the
man
with
the
trunks
will
be
there
at
any
minute
after
five
minutes
of
cagey
manoeuvering
around
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
he
returns
looking
for
junior
saying
that
it
was
simply
a
pile
of
things
left
on
the
bed
covered
with
a
sheet
then
comes
the
unpacking
it
has
been
estimated
that
in
the
trunks
of
returning
vacationists
taking
this
section
of
the
country
as
a
whole
the
following
articles
will
be
pulled
out
during
the
next
few
weeks
sneakers
full
of
sand
bathing
suits
still
damp
from
the
one
last
swim
dead
tennis
balls
last
month
magazines
bought
for
reading
in
the
grove
shells
and
pretty
stones
picked
up
on
the
beach
for
decoration
purposes
for
which
there
has
suddenly
become
no
use
at
all
crabs
salvaged
by
children
who
refused
to
leave
them
behind
lace
scarfs
and
shawls
bought
from
itinerant
armenians
remnants
of
tubes
formerly
containing
sunburn
ointment
bottles
of
citronella
and
white
white
flannel
trousers
ready
for
the
cleaners
showing
ed
and
mollie
on
the
beach
in
their
bathing
suits
which
show
nothing
at
all
faded
flowers
and
assorted
sentimental
objects
calculated
to
bring
up
tender
memories
of
summer
evenings
uncompleted
then
begins
the
tour
of
the
neighborhood
comparing
experiences
to
each
returning
vacationist
it
seems
as
if
everyone
in
town
must
be
interested
in
what
he
or
she
did
during
the
summer
they
stop
perfect
strangers
on
the
streets
and
say
well
a
week
ago
today
at
this
time
we
were
all
walking
up
to
the
for
the
mail
right
out
in
front
of
the
were
the
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
billy
one
night
leading
a
lobster
home
on
a
string
that
was
the
night
we
all
went
swimming
by
yeah
says
the
stranger
and
pushes
his
way
past
then
two
people
get
together
who
have
been
to
different
places
neither
wants
to
hear
about
the
other
summer
and
neither
does
both
talk
at
once
and
pull
out
of
their
pockets
here
where
we
used
to
take
our
lunch
that
nothing
steve
had
a
friend
up
the
lake
who
had
a
launch
and
everyday
there
was
something
doing
over
at
the
casino
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
miriam
she
was
a
sight
pretty
soon
they
come
to
blows
trying
to
make
each
other
listen
the
only
trouble
is
they
never
quite
kill
each
other
if
only
one
could
be
killed
it
would
be
a
great
help
the
next
ban
on
immigration
should
be
on
returning
vacationists
have
government
officials
stationed
in
each
city
and
keep
everyone
out
who
wo
give
a
bond
to
shut
up
and
go
right
to
work
xxxiv
animal
stories
georgie
dog
gets
the
rubbers
on
the
guest
room
old
mother
nature
gathered
all
her
little
pupils
about
her
for
the
daily
lesson
in
how
the
animals
do
the
things
they
do
every
day
waldo
lizard
edna
elephant
and
lawrence
walrus
came
to
mother
school
and
there
learned
all
about
the
useless
feats
performed
by
their
brother
and
sister
animals
today
said
mother
nature
we
shall
find
out
how
it
is
that
georgie
dog
manages
to
get
the
muddy
rubbers
from
the
hall
closet
up
the
stairs
and
onto
the
nice
white
bedspread
in
the
guest
room
you
must
be
sure
to
listen
carefully
and
pay
strict
attention
to
what
georgie
dog
says
only
do
take
too
much
of
it
seriously
for
georgie
is
an
awful
liar
and
sure
enough
in
came
georgie
dog
wagging
his
entire
torso
in
a
paroxysm
of
camaradarie
although
everyone
knew
that
he
had
no
use
for
waldo
lizard
tell
us
georgie
said
mother
nature
how
do
you
do
your
clever
work
of
we
would
like
so
much
to
know
would
we
children
no
mother
nature
came
the
instant
response
from
the
children
so
georgie
dog
began
well
i
tell
you
it
this
way
he
said
snapping
at
a
fly
you
have
to
be
very
niftig
about
it
first
of
all
i
lie
by
the
door
of
the
hall
closet
until
i
see
a
nice
pair
of
muddy
rubbers
kicked
into
it
how
muddy
ought
they
to
be
asked
edna
elephant
although
little
enough
use
she
would
have
for
the
information
i
am
glad
that
you
asked
that
question
replied
georgie
personally
i
like
to
have
mud
on
them
about
the
consistency
of
gurry
that
is
not
too
wet
because
then
it
will
all
drip
off
on
the
way
upstairs
and
not
so
dry
that
it
scrapes
off
on
the
carpet
for
we
must
save
it
all
for
the
bedspread
you
know
as
soon
as
the
rubbers
are
safely
in
the
hall
closet
i
make
a
great
deal
of
todo
about
going
into
the
other
room
in
order
to
give
the
impression
that
there
is
nothing
interesting
enough
in
the
hall
to
keep
me
there
a
good
loud
yawn
helps
to
disarm
any
suspicion
of
undue
excitement
i
sometimes
even
chew
a
bit
of
fringe
on
the
sofa
and
take
a
scolding
for
it
anything
to
draw
attention
from
the
rubbers
then
when
everyone
is
at
dinner
i
sneak
out
and
drag
them
forth
and
how
do
you
manage
to
take
them
both
at
once
piped
up
lawrence
walrus
i
am
glad
that
you
asked
that
question
said
georgie
because
i
was
trying
to
avoid
it
you
can
never
guess
what
the
answer
is
it
is
very
difficult
to
take
two
at
a
time
and
so
we
usually
have
to
take
one
and
then
go
back
and
get
the
other
i
had
a
cousin
once
who
knew
a
grip
which
could
be
worked
on
the
backs
of
overshoes
by
means
of
which
he
could
drag
two
at
a
time
but
he
was
an
exceptionally
fine
dragger
he
once
took
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
from
the
barn
into
the
front
room
where
a
wedding
was
taking
place
and
put
them
on
the
bride
train
of
course
not
one
dog
in
a
million
could
hope
to
do
that
once
upstairs
it
is
quite
easy
getting
them
into
the
guest
room
unless
the
door
happens
to
be
shut
then
what
do
you
think
i
do
i
go
around
through
the
window
onto
the
roof
and
walk
around
to
the
sleeping
porch
and
climb
down
into
the
guest
room
that
way
it
is
a
lot
of
trouble
but
i
think
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
results
are
worth
it
climbing
up
on
the
bed
with
the
rubbers
in
my
mouth
is
difficult
but
it
does
make
any
difference
if
some
of
the
mud
comes
off
on
the
side
of
the
bedspread
in
fact
it
all
helps
in
the
final
effect
i
usually
try
to
smear
them
around
when
i
get
them
at
last
on
the
spread
and
if
i
can
leave
one
of
them
on
the
pillow
i
feel
that
it
a
pretty
fine
little
old
world
after
all
this
done
and
i
am
off
and
georgie
dog
suddenly
disappeared
in
official
pursuit
of
an
automobile
going
miles
an
hour
so
now
said
mother
nature
to
her
little
pupils
we
have
heard
all
about
georgie
dog
work
we
may
listen
to
lillian
mosquito
tell
how
she
makes
her
voice
carry
across
a
room
animal
stories
ii
lillian
mosquito
projects
her
all
the
children
came
crowding
around
mother
nature
one
cold
raw
afternoon
in
summer
crying
in
unison
oh
mother
nature
you
promised
us
that
you
would
tell
us
how
lillian
mosquito
projects
her
voice
you
promised
that
you
would
tell
us
how
lillian
mosquito
projects
her
voice
so
i
did
so
i
did
said
mother
nature
laying
down
an
oak
the
leaves
of
which
she
was
tipping
with
scarlet
for
the
fall
trade
and
so
i
will
so
i
will
at
which
waldo
lizard
edna
elephant
and
lawrence
walrus
jumped
with
imitation
joy
for
they
had
hoped
to
have
an
afternoon
off
mother
nature
led
them
across
the
fields
to
the
piazza
of
a
clubhouse
on
which
there
was
an
exposed
ankle
belonging
to
one
of
the
members
there
as
she
had
expected
they
found
lillian
mosquito
having
tea
lillian
called
mother
nature
come
off
a
minute
i
have
some
little
friends
here
who
would
like
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
manage
to
hum
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
the
impression
of
being
just
outside
the
ear
of
a
person
in
bed
when
actually
you
are
across
the
room
will
you
kindly
repeat
the
question
said
lillian
flying
over
to
the
railing
we
want
to
know
said
mother
nature
how
it
is
that
very
often
when
you
have
been
fairly
caught
it
turns
out
that
you
have
escaped
without
injury
i
would
prefer
to
answer
the
question
as
it
was
first
put
said
lillian
so
waldo
lizard
edna
elephant
and
lawrence
walrus
seeing
that
there
was
no
way
out
cried
yes
yes
lillian
do
tell
us
first
of
all
you
must
know
began
lillian
mosquito
that
my
chief
duty
is
to
annoy
whatever
else
i
do
however
many
bites
i
total
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
do
not
consider
that
i
have
good
unless
i
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
while
doing
it
a
bite
quietly
executed
and
not
discovered
by
the
victim
until
morning
does
me
no
good
it
is
my
duty
and
my
pleasure
to
play
with
him
before
biting
as
you
have
often
heard
a
cat
plays
with
a
mouse
tormenting
him
with
apprehension
and
making
him
struggle
to
defend
himself
if
i
am
using
too
long
words
for
you
please
stop
me
stop
cried
waldo
lizard
reaching
for
his
hat
with
the
idea
of
possibly
getting
to
the
ball
park
by
the
fifth
inning
but
he
was
prevented
from
leaving
by
kindly
old
mother
nature
who
stepped
on
him
with
her
kindly
old
heel
and
lillian
mosquito
continued
i
must
therefore
you
see
be
able
to
use
my
little
voice
with
great
skill
of
course
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
make
my
victim
think
that
i
am
nearer
to
him
than
i
really
am
to
do
this
i
sit
quite
still
let
us
say
on
the
footboard
of
the
bed
and
beginning
to
hum
in
a
very
very
low
tone
of
voice
increase
the
volume
and
raise
the
pitch
gradually
thereby
giving
the
effect
of
approaching
the
pillow
the
man
in
bed
thinks
that
he
hears
me
coming
toward
his
head
and
i
can
often
see
him
waiting
with
clenched
teeth
until
he
thinks
that
i
am
near
enough
to
swat
sometimes
i
strike
a
quick
little
as
if
i
were
right
above
him
and
about
to
make
a
landing
it
is
great
fun
at
such
times
to
see
him
suddenly
strike
himself
over
the
ear
they
always
think
that
i
am
right
at
their
ear
and
then
feel
carefully
between
his
finger
tips
to
see
if
he
has
caught
me
then
too
there
is
always
the
pleasure
of
thinking
that
perhaps
he
has
hurt
himself
quite
badly
by
the
blow
i
have
often
known
victims
of
mine
to
deafen
themselves
permanently
by
jarring
their
eardrums
in
their
wild
attempts
to
catch
me
what
fun
what
fun
cried
edna
elephant
i
must
try
it
myself
just
as
soon
as
ever
i
get
home
it
is
often
a
good
plan
to
make
believe
that
you
have
been
caught
after
one
of
the
swats
continued
lillian
mosquito
and
to
keep
quiet
for
a
while
it
makes
him
cocky
he
thinks
that
he
has
demonstrated
the
superiority
of
man
over
the
rest
of
the
animals
then
he
rolls
over
and
starts
to
sleep
this
is
the
time
to
begin
work
on
him
again
after
he
has
slapped
himself
all
over
the
face
and
head
and
after
he
has
put
on
the
light
and
made
a
search
of
the
room
and
then
gone
back
to
bed
to
think
up
some
new
words
that
is
the
time
when
i
usually
bring
the
climax
about
gradually
approaching
him
from
the
right
i
hum
loudly
at
his
ear
then
suddenly
becoming
quiet
i
fly
silently
and
quickly
around
to
his
neck
just
as
he
hits
himself
on
the
ear
i
bite
his
neck
and
fly
away
and
there
you
are
how
true
that
is
said
mother
nature
there
we
are
come
children
let
us
go
now
for
we
must
be
up
bright
and
early
to
learn
how
lois
hen
scratches
up
the
beets
and
swiss
chard
in
the
gentlemen
gardens
xxxv
the
tariff
unmasked
let
us
get
this
tariff
thing
cleared
up
once
and
for
all
an
explanation
is
due
the
american
people
and
obviously
this
is
the
place
to
make
it
viewing
the
whole
thing
schedule
by
schedule
we
find
it
indefensible
in
schedule
a
alone
the
list
of
necessities
on
which
the
tax
is
to
be
raised
includes
persian
berries
extract
of
nutgalls
and
isinglass
take
isinglass
alone
with
prices
shooting
up
in
this
market
what
is
to
become
of
our
picture
where
once
for
a
nickel
you
could
get
a
picture
of
the
woolworth
building
ablaze
with
lights
with
the
sun
setting
and
the
moon
rising
in
the
background
under
the
proposed
tariff
it
will
easily
set
you
back
fifteen
cents
this
is
all
very
well
for
the
rich
who
can
get
their
picture
at
wholesale
but
how
are
the
poor
to
get
their
art
the
only
justifiable
increase
in
this
schedule
is
on
blues
in
pulp
dried
etc
if
this
will
serve
to
reduce
the
amount
of
those
blues
and
i
got
the
blues
with
which
our
popular
song
market
has
been
flooded
for
the
past
five
years
we
could
almost
bring
ourselves
to
vote
for
the
entire
tariff
bill
as
it
stands
here
we
find
a
tremendous
increase
in
the
tax
on
grindstones
householders
and
travelers
in
general
do
not
appreciate
what
this
means
it
means
that
next
year
when
you
are
returning
from
europe
you
will
have
to
pay
a
duty
on
those
dutch
grindstones
that
you
always
bring
back
to
the
cousins
a
duty
which
will
make
the
importation
of
more
than
three
prohibitive
this
will
lead
to
an
orgy
of
grindstone
smuggling
making
it
necessary
for
hitherto
respectable
people
to
become
by
concealing
grindstones
about
their
clothing
and
in
the
trays
of
their
trunks
think
this
over
right
at
the
start
of
this
list
we
find
charcoal
bars
being
boosted
have
our
children
no
rights
what
is
a
with
children
without
hershey
charcoal
bars
or
gypsum
what
more
picturesque
on
a
ride
through
the
than
a
band
of
gypsum
encamped
by
the
road
with
their
bright
colors
and
gay
tambourine
playing
are
these
simple
folk
to
be
kept
out
of
this
country
simply
because
a
republican
tariff
insists
on
raising
the
tax
on
gypsum
a
way
to
evade
the
injustice
of
this
schedule
is
in
the
matter
of
marble
slabs
marble
slabs
rubbed
are
going
to
cost
more
to
import
than
marble
slabs
unrubbed
what
we
are
planning
to
do
in
this
office
is
to
get
in
a
quantity
of
unrubbed
marble
slabs
and
then
rub
them
ourselves
a
coarse
dry
towel
is
very
good
for
rubbing
they
say
any
further
discussion
of
the
details
of
this
iniquitous
tariff
would
only
enrage
us
to
a
point
of
incoherence
perhaps
a
short
list
of
some
of
the
things
you
will
have
to
do
without

the

other
never

confessions
of
a
chess
champion
with
the
opening
of
the
baseball
season
the
sporting
urge
stirs
in
one
blood
and
we
turn
to
such
books
as
my
chess
career
by
capablanca
capablanca
i
gather
from
his
text
plays
chess
very
well
wherein
he
unquestionably
has
something
on
me
his
book
is
a
combination
of
autobiography
and
pictorial
examples
of
difficult
games
he
has
participated
in
and
won
i
could
understand
the
autobiographical
part
perfectly
but
although
i
have
seen
chess
diagrams
in
the
evening
papers
for
years
i
never
have
been
able
to
become
nervous
over
one
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
when
you
have
seen
one
diagram
of
a
chessboard
you
have
seen
them
all
therefore
i
can
give
only
a
superficial
review
of
the
technical
parts
of
book
his
personal
reminiscences
however
are
full
of
poignant
episodes
for
instance
let
us
take
an
incident
which
occurred
in
his
early
boyhood
when
he
found
out
what
sort
of
man
his
father
really
was
a
sombre
event
in
the
life
of
any
boy
much
more
so
for
the
boy
capablanca
i
was
born
in
havana
the
capital
of
the
island
of
cuba
he
says
the
of
november
i
was
not
yet
five
years
old
when
by
accident
i
came
into
my
father
private
office
and
found
him
playing
with
another
gentleman
i
had
never
seen
a
game
of
chess
before
the
pieces
interested
me
and
i
went
the
next
day
to
see
them
play
again
the
third
day
as
i
looked
on
my
father
a
very
poor
beginner
moved
a
knight
from
a
white
square
to
another
white
square
his
opponent
apparently
not
a
better
player
did
not
notice
it
my
father
won
and
i
proceeded
to
call
him
a
cheat
and
to
laugh
imagine
the
feelings
of
a
young
boy
entering
his
father
private
office
and
seeing
a
man
whom
he
had
been
brought
up
to
love
and
to
revere
moving
a
knight
from
one
white
square
to
another
it
is
a
wonder
that
the
boy
had
the
courage
to
grow
up
at
all
with
a
start
in
life
like
that
but
he
did
grow
up
and
at
the
age
of
eight
in
spite
of
the
advice
of
doctors
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
havana
chess
club
as
he
says
in
describing
this
period
of
his
career
soon
don
celso
golmayo
the
strongest
player
there
was
unable
to
give
me
a
rook
so
you
can
see
how
good
he
was
don
celso
could
give
him
a
rook
and
if
don
celso
could
who
on
earth
could
in
his
introduction
capablanca
i
wish
that
i
could
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
capablanca
is
possibly
a
relation
of
the
casablanca
boy
who
did
the
right
thing
by
the
burning
deck
they
are
of
course
two
entirely
different
people
in
his
introduction
capablanca
says
conceit
i
consider
a
foolish
thing
but
more
foolish
still
is
that
false
modesty
that
vainly
attempts
to
conceal
that
which
all
facts
tend

in

with
his

with
members
of

chess
club

down
without

my

in
speaking
of
his
endings
a
term
we
chess
experts
use
to
designate
the
last
part
of
our
game
to
murmur
modestly
the
endings
i
already
played
very
well
and
to
my
mind
had
attained
the
high
standard
for
which
they
were
in
the
future
to
be
well
known
capablanca

have
to
watch

false

this

no

only
right
to

a
part
of
the

story
of
the

capablanca
and

in

out

brave

song
entitled

runs
as

oh

sweep

with
your
castles
queens
and
pawns
we
are
with
you
all

till
the

win
alway
and
our
hearts
beat
true
old
for
you
on
day
up
to
this
point
the
game
had
proceeded
along
the
lines
generally
recommended
by
the
masters
writes
capablanca
the
last
move
however
is
a
slight
deviation
from
the
regular
course
which
brings
this
knight
back
to
b
in
order
to
leave
open
the
diagonal
for
the
q
and
besides
is
more
in
accordance
with
the
defensive
nature
of
the
game
much
more
could
be
said
as
to
the
reasons
that
make
kt

the
preferred
move
of
most
masters
of
course
lest
there
be
some
misapprehension
let
me
state
that
the
move
kt

is
made
in

his

a
riot
from

you

ask
for

wake
up

are

for

of

it
is
a
little
rough
in

but
you
know
what
percy
mackaye
is
when
he
gets
loose
on
a
it
is
good
clean
rabelaisian
fun
such
as
was
in
washington
the
man
who
made
us
i
always
felt
that
it
was
very
prudish
of
the
police
to
stop
that
play
just
as
it
was
commencing
its
run
or
maybe
it
was
the
police
that
stopped
it
something
did
i
remember
but
rip
van
winkle
has
much
more
zip
to
it
than
washington
had
in
the
first
place
the
lyrics
are
better
they
have
more
of
a
lilt
to
them
than
the
lines
of
the
earlier
work
had
here
is
the

his

i
venture
to
say
that
irving
berlin
himself
could
have
done
anything
catchier
than
that
by
way
of
a
lyric
or
this
little
snatch
of
a

sung
by
the
old
women
of
the

nay
nay

wo
last
a
half
an
the
trouble
with
most
lyrics
is
that
they
are
written
by
who
have
had
no
education
mackaye
college
training
shows
itself
in
every
line
of
the
opera
there
is
a
subtlety
of
a
delicacy
of
meter
and
above
all
an
originality
of
thought
and
expression
which
promises
much
for
the
school
of
lyricists
here
for
instance
is
a
lyric
which
joe
mccarthy
could
never
have
written
spoke
nancy
spanking
nancy
says
my
feet
are

too
dancy
dancy
o
so
is
my
fancy
o
of

this

and
you
can
get
away
with
a
great
deal
of
that
stuff
when
you
call
it
a
you
can
throw
it
all
back
on
the
old
folk
at
home
and
they
ca
say
a
word
but
even
the
local
wits
of
rip
van
winkle
time
would
have
repudiated
the
comedy
lines
which
mackaye
gives
rip
to
say

ed

by
the
way
might
do

by
the

if
he
could
get
the
rights
to
produce

in

let

stay
on
the
programme
but
give
ed
wynn
the
white
card
to
do
as
he
might
see
fit
with
the
book
for

one
of
mackaye
characters
is
named
dirck
spuytenduyvil
let
him
stand
as
he
is
but
give
him
two
cousins
mynheer
yonkers
and
jan
one
hundred

the
three
of
them
could
do
a

there

practically
no

lend
itself
admirably
to
broadway
treatment
for
mackaye

taken
liberties
with
the

introduced
the
topical
idea

the

of

the

there

so
at

rip
fell
for
the
promise
of
wandering
in
the
fairy
season
as
so
many
have
done
at
the
invitation
of
a
man
who
has
made

something
at

you
could

rip
got
out

you

i

there

saying
that

reading
of

it

was

by

at

time
among

parishioners
that
he
himself
wrote
them
and
on
being
questioned
on
the
matter
he
did
not
deny
it
simply
smiling
and
saying
i
glad
if

they
were

we
have
so
many
many
problems
in
america
books
are
constantly
being
written
offering
solutions
for
them
but
still
they
persist
there
are
volumes
on
auction
bridge
family
budgets
and
a
great
many
people
have
ideas
on
what
should
be
done
to
relieve
the
country
of
certain
undesirable
persons
who
have
displayed
a
lack
of
sympathy
with
american
institutions
as
if
american
institutions
needed
sympathy
and
some
of
the
more
among
us
are
writing
books
showing
our
duty
to
the
struggling
young
nationalities
of
europe
it
is
bewildering
to
be
confronted
by
all
these
problems
each
demanding
intelligent
solution
little
wonder
then
that
we
have
no
time
for
writing
books
on
the
one
problem
which
is
exclusively
our
own
with
so
many
wrongs
in
the
world
to
be
righted
who
can
blame
us
for
overlooking
the
one
tragic
wrong
which
lies
at
our
door
with
so
many
heathen
to
whom
the
word
of
god
must
be
brought
and
so
many
wild
revolutionists
in
whom
must
be
instilled
a
respect
for
law
and
order
is
it
strange
that
we
should
ourselves
sometimes
lump
the
word
of
god
and
the
principles
of
law
and
order
together
under
the
head
of
sentimentality
and
shrug
our
shoulders
justice
in
the
abstract
is
our
aim
any
american
will
tell
you
that
so
why
haggle
over
details
and
insist
on
justice
for
the
negro
but
du
bois
does
insist
on
justice
for
the
negro
and
in
his
book
darkwater
harcourt
brace
his
voice
rings
out
in
a
bitter
warning
through
the
complacent
quiet
which
usually
reigns
around
this
problem
of
america
du
bois
seems
to
forget
that
we
have
the
affairs
of
a
great
many
people
to
attend
to
and
persists
in
calling
our
attention
to
this
affair
of
our
own
and
what
is
worse
in
the
minds
of
all
persons
he
does
not
do
it
at
all
politely
he
seems
to
be
quite
distressed
about
something
maybe
it
is
because
he
finds
himself
a
man
of
superior
mind
and
of
sensitive
spirit
who
is
a
graduate
of
harvard
a
professor
and
a
sincere
worker
for
the
betterment
of
mankind
relegated
to
an
inferior
order
by
many
men
and
women
who
are
obviously
his
inferiors
simply
because
he
happens
to
differ
from
them
in
the
color
of
his
skin
maybe
it
is
because
he
sees
the
people
of
his
own
race
who
have
not
had
his
advantages
if
a
negro
may
ever
be
said
to
have
received
an
advantage
being
crowded
into
an
ignominious
spiritual
serfdom
equally
as
bad
as
the
physical
serfdom
from
which
they
were
so
recently
freed
maybe
it
is
because
of
these
things
that
du
bois
seems
overwrought
or
perhaps
it
is
because
he
reads
each
day
of
how
jealous
we
are
as
a
nation
of
the
sanctity
of
our
constitution
how
we
revere
it
and
draw
a
flashing
sword
against
its
detractors
and
then
sees
this
very
constitution
being
flouted
as
a
matter
of
course
in
those
districts
where
the
amendment
giving
the
negroes
a
right
to
vote
is
popularly
considered
one
of
the
five
funniest
jokes
in
the
world
perhaps
he
hears
candidates
for
office
insisting
on
a
reign
of
law
or
a
plea
for
order
above
all
things
by
some
sentimentalist
or
other
or
public
speakers
advising
those
who
have
not
respect
for
american
institutions
to
go
back
whence
they
came
and
then
sees
whole
sections
of
the
country
violating
every
principle
of
law
and
order
and
mocking
american
institutions
for
the
sake
of
teaching
a
nigger
his
place
perhaps
during
the
war
he
heard
of
the
bloody
crimes
of
our
enemies
and
saw
preachers
and
editors
and
statesmen
stand
aghast
at
the
barbaric
atrocities
which
won
for
the
german
the
name
of
hun
and
then
looked
toward
his
own
people
and
saw
them
being
burned
disembowelled
and
tortured
with
a
civic
unanimity
and
tacit
legal
sanction
which
made
the
word
hun
sound
weak
perhaps
he
has
heard
it
boasted
that
in
america
every
man
who
is
honest
industrious
and
intelligent
has
a
good
chance
to
win
out
and
has
seen
honest
industrious
and
intelligent
men
whose
skins
are
black
stopped
short
by
a
wall
so
high
and
so
thick
that
all
they
can
do
on
having
reached
that
far
is
to
bow
their
heads
and
go
slowly
back
any
one
of
these
reasons
should
have
been
sufficient
for
having
written
darkwater
it
is
unfortunate
that
du
bois
should
have
raised
this
question
of
our
own
responsibility
just
at
this
time
when
we
were
showing
off
so
nicely
it
may
remind
some
one
that
instead
of
taking
over
a
protectorate
of

we
might
better
take
over
a
protectorate
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
yearly
leads
the
proud
list
of
lynchers
but
then
there
will
not
be
enough
people
who
see
du
bois
book
to
cause
any
great
national
movement
so
we
are
quite
sure
for
the
time
being
of
being
able
to
devote
our
energies
to
the
solution
of
our
other
problems
do
forget
therefore
to
write
your
congressman
about
a
universal
bill
and
give
a
little
thought
if
you
can
to
the
question
of

an
attractive

done
in

for
the

it
slips
neatly
into
the
pocket
where
it
easily
becomes
lost
among
letters
and
bills
appearing
again
only
when
you
have
procured
another
so
much
for
its
physical
features
of
the
text
matter
it
is
difficult
to
write
without
passion
no
more
disheartening
work
has
been
put
on
the
market
this
season
in
an
attempt
to
evade
the
law
the
new
york
central
has
kept
its
clocks
at
what
is
called
eastern
standard
time
meaning
that
it
is
standard
on
east
street
between
vanderbilt
and
lexington
avenues
practically
everywhere
else
in
new
york
the
clocks
are
an
hour
ahead
it
is
this
eastern
standard
time
that
gives
the
its
distinctive
flavor
each
train
has
been
demoted
one
hour
and
then
for
fear
that
it
would
be
too
easy
to
understand
this
an
extra
three
or
four
minutes
have
been
thrown
in
or
taken
out
just
so
that
no
mistake
can
help
being
made
in
order
to
read
the
new
understandingly
the
following
procedure
is
now
necessary
take
a
room
in
some
quiet
family
hotel
where
the
noise
from
the
street
is
reduced
to
minimum
place
the
on
the
and
sit
in
front
of
it
holding
a
pencil
in
the
right
hand
and
a
watch
eastern
christian
time
in
the
left
then
decide
on
the
time
you
think
you
would
like
to
reach
home
let
us
say
that
you
usually
have
dinner
at
you
would
if
you
could
do
just
what
you
wanted
reach
valhalla
at
very
well
it
takes
about
an
hour
from
the
grand
central
terminal
to
valhalla
how
about
a
train
leaving
around
look
at
the
for
a
train
which
leaves
about
eastern
standard
time
write
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
add
subtract
the
number
of
stations
that
valhalla
is
above
white
plains
sharpen
your
pencil
and
bind
up
your
cut
finger
and
subtract
the
number
you
first
thought
of
and
the
result
will
show
the
number
of
presidents
of
the
united
states
who
have
been
assassinated
while
in
office
then
go
over
to
the
grand
central
terminal
and
ask
one
of
the
information
clerks
what
you
want
to
know
illustration
listen
ed
this
is
how
it
goes
they
will
be
glad
to
see
you
for
during
the
last
three
days
they
have
been
actually
hungering
for
the
sight
of
a
human
face
sometimes
it
has
seemed
to
them
that
the
silence
and
loneliness
there
behind
the
information
counter
would
drive
them
mad
if
some
one
any
one
would
only
come
and
speak
to
them
that
is
why
one
of
them
is
over
in
the
corner
chewing
up
into
small
balls
and
playing
marbles
with
them
he
has
gone
mad
from
loneliness
the
other
clerk
the
one
who
is
looking
at
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
mumbling
lincoln
gettysburg
address
has
only
a
few
more
minutes
before
he
too
succumbs
and
that
low
rumbling
sound
what
is
that
it
comes
from
the
crowd
of
commuters
standing
in
front
of
the
gate
of
what
used
to
be
the
let
us
draw
near
and
hear
what
they
are
discussing
why
it
is
the
new
of
all
things
listen
ed
this
is
how
it
goes
this
train
that
goes
at
according
to
this
is
really
the
old

hour

of
talk

it
says
lissen
eddie
whatever
else
its
publishers
may
say
about
it
the
new
new
york
central
bids
fair
to
be
the
publication
of
the
season
xlii
bok
americanization
if
ever
you
should
feel
important
enough
to
write
an
autobiography
to
give
to
the
world
and
dislike
to
say
all
the
nice
things
about
yourself
that
you
feel
really
ought
to
be
said
just
write
it
in
the
third
person
edward
bok
has
done
this
in
the
americanization
of
edward
bok
and
the
effect
is
quite
touching
in
its
modesty
in
an
explanation
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
bok
disclaims
any
credit
for
the
winning
ways
and
remarkable
success
of
his
hero
edward
bok
edward
bok
the
little
dutch
boy
who
landed
in
america
in
and
later
became
the
editor
of
the
greatest
women
advertising
medium
in
the
country
is
an
entirely
different
person
from
the
edward
bok
who
is
telling
the
story
you
understand
this
to
begin
with
otherwise
you
may
misjudge
the
author
i
have
again
and
again
found
myself
writes
bok
watching
with
intense
amusement
and
interest
the
edward
bok
of
this
book
at
work
his
tastes
his
outlook
his
manner
of
looking
at
things
were
totally
at
variance
with
my
own
he
has
had
and
has
been
a
personality
apart
from
my
private
self
the
only
connection
between
edward
bok
the
editor
and
edward
bok
the
autobiographer
seems
to
be
that
editor
bok
allows
author
bok
to
have
a
checking
account
in
his
bank
under
their
common
name
thus
completely
detached
from
his
hero
bok
proceeds
and
is
able
to
narrate
on
page
in
the
manner
of
horatio
alger
how
young
edward
taunted
by
his
brooklyn
schoolmates
gave
a
sound
thrashing
to
the
ringleader
after
which
he
found
himself
looking
into
the
eyes
of
a
crowd
of
very
respectful
boys
and
giggling
girls
who
readily
made
a
passageway
for
his
brother
and
himself
when
they
indicated
a
desire
to
leave
the
and
go
home
he
can
also
without
seeming
in
the
least
conceited
tell
how
through
his
firmness
in
refusing
to
write
in
the
spencerian
manner
prescribed
in
school
he
succeeded
in
bringing
the
principal
and
the
whole
board
of
education
to
their
senses
resulting
in
a
complete
reversal
of
the
policy
in
the
matter
of
handwriting
instruction
the
horatio
alger
note
is
dominant
throughout
the
story
of
young
edward
boyhood
his
cheerfulness
and
business
sagacity
so
impressed
everyone
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
that
he
was
soon
outdistancing
all
the
other
boys
in
the
process
of
and
no
one
is
more
smilingly
tolerant
of
the
irresistible
progress
of
young
edward
bok
in
making
friends
and
money
than
edward
bok
the
impersonal
author
of
the
book
he
just
loves
to
see
the
young
boy
get
ahead
it
will
perhaps
aid
in
getting
an
idea
of
the
personality
and
confident
presence
of
the
boy
bok
to
state
that
he
was
a
feverish
collector
of
autographs
whenever
any
famous
personage
came
to
town
the
young
man
would
find
out
at
what
hotel
he
was
staying
and
would
proceed
to
hound
him
until
he
had
got
him
to
write
his
name
with
some
appropriate
sentiment
in
a
little
book
in
advertising
the
present
volume
the
publishers
give
a
list
of
names
of
historical
characters
who
feature
in
bok
reminiscences
gens
grant
and
garfield
oliver
wendell
holmes
longfellow
emerson
and
dozens
of
others
and
so
they
do
figure
in
the
book
but
as
victims
of
the
young
dutch
boy
passion
for
autographs
still
perhaps
they
did
not
mind
for
the
author
gives
us
to
understand
that
they
were
all
so
charmed
with
the
prepossessing
manner
and
intelligent
bearing
of
the
young
autograph
hound
that
they
not
only
were
continually
asking
him
to
dinner
he
usually
timed
his
visit
so
as
to
catch
them
just
as
they
were
entering
the
but
insisted
on
giving
him
letters
of
introduction
to
their
friends
only
abraham
lincoln
and
ralph
waldo
emerson
neglected
to
register
extreme
pleasure
at
being
approached
by
the
smiling
lad
both
lincoln
and
emerson
were
failing
in
their
minds
at
the
time
however
which
satisfactorily
explains
their
coolness
at
least
for
the
author
in
lincoln
case
an
attempt
was
made
to
interest
her
in
an
autographed
photograph
of
grant
but
edward
saw
that
the
widow
of
the
great
lincoln
did
not
mentally
respond
to
his
pleasure
in
his
possession
could
it
have
been
possible
that
the
widow
of
the
great
lincoln
was
a
trifle
bored
the
account
of
the
intrusion
on
emerson
in
concord
borders
on
the
sacrilegious
here
was
the
venerable
philosopher
five
months
before
his
death
when
his
great
mind
had
already
gone
on
before
him
being
visited
by
a
strange
lad
with
a
passion
for
autographs
who
sat
and
watched
for
those
lucid
moments
when
then
sun
would
break
through
the
clouded
brain
making
it
possible
for
emerson
to
hold
the
pen
and
form
the
letters
of
his
name
then
young
edward
was
off
with
another
trophy
in
his
belt
and
another
stride
made
in
his
progress
toward
americanization
lovers
of
emerson
could
wish
that
the
impersonal
editor
of
these
memoirs
had
omitted
the
account
of
this
victory
americanization
seems
from
the
present
document
to
consist
of
first
making
as
many
influential
friends
as
possible
who
may
be
able
to
help
you
at
some
future
time
second
making
as
much
money
as
possible
young
edward
used
his
position
as
stenographer
to
jay
gould
to
glean
tips
on
the
market
thereby
cleaning
up
for
himself
and
his
teacher
at

open

main
chance

nothing

first
see
columbine
belllounds
adopted
daughter
of
old
belllounds
the
rancher
of
colorado
she
is
riding
along
the
trail
overlooking
the
valley
today
girlish
ordeals
and
griefs
seemed
back
in
the
past
she
was
a
woman
at
nineteen
and
face
to
face
with
the
first
great
problem
in
her
life
suggestion
for
title
decoration
a
pair
of
reluctant
feet
standing
at
the
junction
of
a
brook
and
a
river
she
stops
to
pick
some
columbines
and
soliloquizes
the
author
says
she
spoke
aloud
as
if
the
sound
of
her
voice
might
convince
her
but
it
is
not
clear
from
the
text
just
what
she
expected
to
be
convinced
of
here
is
her
argument
to
herself
columbine
so
they
named
me
those
miners
who
found
me
a
baby
lost
in
the
woods
asleep
among
the
columbines
decorative
nasturtiums
having
convinced
herself
in
these
reassuring
words
as
she
stands
alone
on
the
ridge
in
god
great
outdoors
she
explains
that
she
has
promised
to
marry
jack
belllounds
the
worthless
son
of
her
although
any
one
can
tell
that
she
is
in
love
with
wilson
moore
a
on
the
ranch
you
will
understand
what
a
sacrifice
this
was
to
be
when
the
author
says
that
the
lower
part
of
jack
face
was
weak
to
the
ranch
comes
wade
the
mysterious
man
of
the
plains
he
applies
for
a
job
and
not
only
that
but
he
gets
it
which
gives
him
a
chance
to
let
us
know
that
eighteen
years
ago
he
had
driven
the
woman
he
loved
away
from
him
out
into
the
world
with
her
baby
girl
jealous
fool
too
late
had
he
discovered
his
fatal
blunder
that
was
bent
wade
secret
fancy
sketch
of
a
secret
and
as
we
already
know
that
columbine
is
almost
nineteen
i
think
she
told
herself
this
fact
aloud
once
when
she
was
out
riding
alone
just
to
convince
herself
the
shock
is
not
so
great
as
it
might
have
been
to
hear
wade
murmur
aloud
doubtless
to
convince
himself
too
baby
would
have
been
let
see
nineteen
years
old
now
if
she
lived
any
bets
on
who
columbine
really
is
let
us
digress
from
the
scenario
a
minute
to
cite
a
scintillating
passage
one
of
many
in
the
book
wade
is
speaking
can
never
tell
what
a
dog
is
until
you
know
him
dogs
are
like
men
some
of
look
good
but
they
really
bad
an
that
works
the
other
way
round
oscar
wilde
stuff
that
is
how
often
have
you
felt
the
truth
of
what
grey
says
here
and
yet
have
never
been
able
to
put
it
into
words
it
is
this
ability
to
put
thoughts
into
words
that
makes
him
one
of
our
most
popular
authors
today
but
enough
of
this
wade
determines
that
his
little
gel
shall
not
know
him
as
her
father
and
furthermore
that
she
shall
not
marry
jack
belllounds
so
he
goes
to
the
cabin
of
wils
moore
and
tells
him
that
columbine
is
unhappy
at
the
thought
of
her
approaching
you
guessed
it
nuptials
pard
she
loves
me
still
wils
hers
is
the
kind
that
grows
stronger
with
time
i
know
heart
and
an
intertwined
let
it
be
said
right
here
however
that
jack
belllounds
rough
and
villainous
as
he
is
is
the
kind
of
who
says
to
his
father
i
still
love
you
dad
despite
the
cruel
thing
you
did
to
me
no
who
says
despite
can
be
entirely
bad
neither
can
he
be
a
it
is
later
after
a
thrilling
series
of
physical
encounters
that
columbine
tells
jack
belllounds
in
so
many
words
that
she
loves
wils
moore
then
wade
saw
the
glory
of
her
saw
her
mother
again
in
that
proud
fierce
uplift
of
face
that
flamed
red
and
then
blazed
white
saw
hate
and
passion

suppressing
jurgen
of
course
it
was
silly
to
suppress
jurgen
that
goes
without
saying
but
it
seems
equally
silly
because
of
its
being
suppressed
to
hail
it
as
high
art
it
is
simply
james
branch
cabell
quaint
way
of
telling
a
raw
story
and
it
is
particularly
his
own
way
either
personally
i
like
the
modern
method
much
better
jurgen
is
a
frank
imitation
of
the
pornographers
and
although
it
is
a
very
good
imitation
it
need
not
rank
cabell
any
higher
than
the
maker
of
a
copy
of
some
boeotian
sculptural
oddity
the
author
in
defense
of
his
fortunate
book
lifts
his
eyebrows
and
says
honi
soit
he
claims
and
quite
rightly
that
everything
he
has
written
has
at
least
one
decent
meaning
and
that
anyone
who
reads
anything
indecent
into
it
automatically
convicts
himself
of
being
in
a
pathological
condition
the
question
is
if
cabell
had
been
convinced
beforehand
that
nowhere
in
all
this
broad
land
would
there
be
anyone
who
would
read
another
meaning
into
his
words
would
he
ever
have
bothered
to
write
the
book
at
all
cabell
is
admittedly
a
genealogist
he
is
an
earnest
student
of
the
literature
of
past
centuries
he
has
become
so
steeped
in
the
phrases
and
literary
mannerisms
of
the
middle
and
ages
that
even
in
his
book
of
modern
essays
beyond
life
he
is
constantly
emitting
strange
words
which
were
last
used
by
the
correspondents
who
covered
the
crusades
no
man
has
to
be
as
artificially
obsolete
as
cabell
is
he
likes
to
be
in
jurgen
he
has
simply
let
himself
go
there
is
no
pretense
of
writing
like
a
modern
there
is
no
pretense
of
writing
in
the
style
of
even
james
branch
cabell
it
is
frankly
in
the
manner
of
those
ancient
authors
whose
works
are
sold
surreptitiously
to
college
students
by
gentlemen
who
whisper
their
behind
a
line
of
red
sample
bindings
and
it
is
not
in
the
manner
of
rabelais
although
name
has
been
frequently
used
in
describing
jurgen
rabelais
seldom
hid
his
thought
behind
two
meanings
there
was
only
one
meaning
and
you
could
take
it
or
leave
it
and
rabelais
would
never
have
said
honi
soit
by
way
of
defense
the
general
effect
is
one
of
fielding
or
sterne
telling
the
story
of
sir
gawain
and
the
green
knight
with
their
own
embellishments
to
the
boys
at
the
club
if
all
that
is
necessary
to
produce
a
work
of
art
is
to
take
a
story
and
tell
it
in
dusty
english
we
might
try
our
luck
with
the
modern
yarn
about
the
who
came
to
the
country
hotel
late
at
night
and
see
how
far
we
can
get
with
it
in
the
manner
of
james
branch
cabell
imitating
fielding
imitating
someone
else
it
is
a
tale
which
they
narrate
in
nouveau
rochelle
saying
in
the
old
days
there
came
one
night
a
traveling
man
to
an
inn
and
the
night
was
late
and
he
was
sore
beset
what
with
eftsoons
he
made
known
his
wants
to
the
churl
behind
the
desk
who
was
named
gogyrvan
and
thus
he
spake
any
rooms
indeed
sir
no
was
gogyrvan
glose
now
but
this
is
an
deplorable
thing
god
wot
says
the
traveling
man
fie
brother
but
you
think
awry
come
don
smart
your
and
answer
me
again
an
you
have
forgot
my
query
it
was
rooms
bo
whereat
the
churl
behind
the
desk
gat
him
down
from
his
stool
and
closed
one
eye
in
a
wink
there
is
one
room
he
says
and
places
his
forefinger
along
the
side
of
his
nose
in
the
manner
of
a
man
who
places
his
forefinger
along
the
side
of
his
nose
but
at
this
point
i
am
stopped
short
by
the
warning
passage
through
the
room
of
a
cold
damp
current
of
air
as
from
the
grave
and
i
know
that
it
is
one
of
sumner
vice
deputies
flitting
by
on
his
rounds
in
defense
of
the
public
morals
so
i
can
go
no
further
for
public
morals
must
be
defended
even
at
the
cost
of
public
morality
a
statement
which
means
nothing
but
which
sounds
rather
well
i
think
i
shall
try
to
work
it
in
again
some
time
but
perhaps
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
it
is
perfectly
easy
to
write
something
that
will
sound
classic
if
you
can
only
remember
enough
old
words
when
cabell
has
learned
the
language
he
ought
to
write
a
good
book
in
modern
english
there
are
lots
of
people
who
read
it
and
they
speak
very
highly
of
it
as
a
means
of
expression
but
there
are
certain
things
that
you
can
not
express
in
it
without
sounding
crass
which
would
be
a
disadvantage
in
telling
a
story
like
jurgen
xlv
while
on
the
subject
of
books
which
we
read
because
we
think
we
ought
to
and
while
vicente
blasco
ibáñez
is
on
the
ocean
and
ca
hear
what
is
being
said
let
form
a
secret
society
i
will
be
one
of
any
three
to
meet
behind
a
barn
and
admit
that
i
would
not
give
a
good
gosh
darn
if
a
were
to
tell
me
tomorrow
that
i
should
never
never
have
a
chance
to
read
another
book
by
the
great
spanish
novelist
any
of
the
american
reading
public
who
desire
to
join
this
secret
society
may
do
so
without
fear
of
publicity
as
the
names
will
not
be
given
out
the
only
means
of
distinguishing
a
will
be
a
tiny
gold
emblem
to
be
worn
in
the
lapel
representing
the
figure
couchant
of
spain
most
touted
animal
the
motto
will
be
nimmermehr
which
is
a
german
translation
of
the
spanish
phrase
not
even
once
again
simply
because
i
myself
am
not
impressed
by
a
book
i
have
no
authority
to
brand
anyone
who
does
not
like
it
as
a
poseur
and
say
that
he
is
only
making
believe
that
he
likes
it
and
there
must
be
a
great
many
highly
literary
people
who
really
and
sincerely
do
think
that
señor
blasco
books
are
the
finest
novels
of
the
epoch
it
would
therefore
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
say
that
spain
is
now
for
the
first
time
since
before
in
a
position
to
kid
the
united
states
and
vicariously
through
watching
her
famous
son
count
his
royalties
and
gate
receipts
to
feel
avenged
for
the
loss
of
her
islands
if
america
has
found
something
superfine
in
ibáñez
that
his
countrymen
have
missed
then
america
is
of
course
to
be
congratulated
and
not
kidded
but
probably
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
blasco
when
he
suddenly
found
himself
a
lion
in
our
literary
arena
instead
of
in
his
accustomed
rôle
of
bull
in
his
home
ring
and
those
who
know
say
that
you
could
have
knocked
his
compatriots
over
with
a
feather
when
the
news
came
that
old
man
ibáñez
son
had
made
good
in
the
united
states
to
the
extent
of
something
like
five
hundred
million
pesetas
for
like
the
prophet
whom
some
one
was
telling
about
ibáñez
was
not
known
at
home
as
a
particularly
hot
tamale
but
then
he
never
had
such
a
persistent
publisher
in
spain
and
is
not
the
art
there
that
it
is
in
america
when
the
final
accounting
of
the
great
success
of
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
in
this
country
is
taken
honorable
mention
must
be
made
of
the
man
at
the
dutton
store
who
had
charge
of
the
advertising
the
great
spanish
novelist
was
in
the
french
propaganda
service
during
the
war
it
was
his
job
to
make
germany
unpopular
in
spanish
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
is
obviously
propaganda
and
not
particularly
subtle
propaganda
either
certain
chapters
might
have
come
direct
from
our
own
creel
committee
and
one
may
still
be
true
to
the
allied
cause
and
yet
maintain
that
propaganda
and
literature
do
not
mix
with
any
degree
of
illusion
there
is
no
question
of
course
that
those
chapters
in
the
book
which
are
descriptive
of
the
advance
and
subsequent
retreat
of
the
german
troops
under
the
eye
of
don
marcelo
are
masterpieces
of
descriptive
reporting
but
philip
gibbs
has
given
us
a
whole
book
of
masterpieces
of
descriptive
reporting
which
do
not
bear
the
stamp
of
approval
of
the
official
propaganda
bureau
and
furthermore
philip
gibbs
does
not
wear
a
sport
shirt
open
at
the
neck
at
least
he
never
had
his
picture
taken
that
way
as
for
the
rest
of
the
books
that
were
dragged
out
from
the
spanish
for
storehouse
when
the
four
horsemen
romped
in
winners
i
can
speak
only
as
i
would
speak
of
the
world
most
famous
battles
or
heroines
in
shakespeare
i
have
looked
them
over
i
gave
mare
nostrum
a
great
deal
of
my
very
valuable
time
because
the
advertisements
spoke
so
highly
of
it
woman
triumphant
took
less
time
because
i
decided
to
stop
earlier
in
the
book
blood
and
sand
i
passed
up
having
once
seen
a
madrid
for
myself
which
may
account
for
this
nasty
attitude
i
have
toward
any
spanish
product
i
am
told
however
that
this
is
the
best
of
them
all
it
is
remarkable
that
for
a
writer
who
seems
to
have
left
such
an
indelible
imprint
in
the
minds
of
the
american
people
whose
works
have
been
ranked
with
the
greatest
of
all
time
and
who
received
more
publicity
during
one
day
of
his
visit
here
than
charles
dickens
received
during
his
whole
sojourn
in
america
señor
blasco
and
his
works
form
a
remarkably
small
part
of
the
spontaneous
literary
conversation
of
the
day
the
characters
which
he
has
created
have
not
taken
any
appreciable
hold
in
the
public
imagination
their
names
are
never
used
as
examples
of
anything
who
were
some
of
his
chief
characters
by
the
way
what
did
they
say
that
was
worth
remembering
what
did
they
do
that
characters
have
not
been
doing
for
many
generations
did
you
ever
hear
anyone
say
he
talks
like
a
character
in
ibáñez
or
this
might
have
happened
in
one
of
ibáñez
books
of
course
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
write
a
great
book
from
which
no
one
would
quote
that
is
probably
happening
all
the
time
but
it
is
because
no
one
has
read
it
here
we
have
an
author
whose
vogue
in
this
country
according
to
statistics
is
equal
to
that
of
any
writer
of
novels
in
the
world
and
as
soon
as
his
publicity
department
stops
functioning
i
should
like
to
lay
a
little
bet
that
he
will
not
be
heard
of
again
xlvi
on
bricklaying
after
a
series
of
introspective
accounts
of
the
babyhood
childhood
adolescence
and
inevitably
gloomy
maturity
of
countless
men
and
women
it
is
refreshing
to
turn
to
bricklaying
in
modern
practice
by
stewart
scrimshaw
one
says
back
to
normal
again
for
bricklaying
is
nothing
if
not
normal
and
scrimshaw
has
given
just
enough
of
the
romantic
charm
of
artistic
enthusiasm
to
make
it
positively
fascinating
there
was
a
time
when
man
did
not
know
how
to
lay
bricks
he
says
in
his
scholarly
introductory
chapter
on
the
ancient
art
a
time
when
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
bricks
there
was
a
time
when
fortresses
and
cathedrals
were
unknown
and
churches
and
residences
were
not
to
be
seen
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
today
we
see
wonderful
architecture
noble
and
glorious
structures
magnificent
skyscrapers
and
pretty
bungalows
to
one
who
has
been
scouring
westchester
county
for
the
past
two
months
looking
at
the
structures
which
are
being
offered
for
sale
as
homes
pretty
bungalows
comes
as
mot
they
certainly
are
no
more
than
pretty
one
can
not
read
far
in
scrimshaw
book
without
blushing
for
the
inadequacy
of
modern
education
we
are
turned
out
of
our
schools
as
educated
young
men
and
women
and
yet
what
college
graduate
here
tonight
can
tell
me
when
the
first
brick
in
america
was
made
or
even
where
it
was
made
i
thought
not
well
it
was
made
in
new
haven
in
scrimshaw
does
not
say
what
it
was
made
for
but
a
conjecture
would
be
that
it
was
the
handiwork
of
yale
students
for
tactical
use
in
the
harvard
game
oh
i
know
that
yale
was
running
in
but
what
difference
does
that
make
in
an
informal
little
article
like
this
it
is
getting
so
that
a
man
make
any
statement
at
all
without
being
caught
up
on
it
by
some
busybody
or
other
but
let
get
down
to
the
art
itself
scrimshaw
first
bit
of
advice
is
very
sound
the
bricklayer
should
first
take
a
keen
glance
at
the
scaffolding
upon
which
he
is
to
work
to
see
that
there
is
nothing
broken
or
dangerous
connected
with
it
this
is
essential
because
more
important
than
anything
else
to
him
is
the
preservation
of
his
life
and
limb
oh
scrimshaw
how
true
that
is
if
i
were
a
bricklayer
i
would
devote
practically
my
whole
morning
inspecting
the
scaffolding
on
which
i
was
to
work
whatever
else
i
shirked
i
would
put
my
whole
heart
and
soul
into
this
part
of
my
task
every
rope
should
be
tested
every
board
examined
and
i
doubt
if
even
then
i
would
go
up
on
the
scaffold
any
bricks
that
i
could
not
lay
with
my
feet
on
terra
firma
there
is
a
joke
somewhere
about
terra
cotta
but
i
busy
now
could
be
laid
by
some
one
else
but
we
do
seem
to
be
getting
ahead
in
our
instruction
in
practical
bricklaying
well
all
right
take
this
pressed
bricks
which
are
buttered
can
be
laid
with
a
joint
although
a
joint
of
of
an
inch
is
to
be
preferred
joe
get
this
gentleman
a
joint
of
of
an
inch
buttered
service
that
our
motto
it
takes
a
book
like
this
to
make
a
man
realize
what
he
misses
in
his
everyday
life
for
instance
who
would
think
that
right
here
in
new
york
there
were
people
who
specialized
in
corbeling
rain
or
shine
hot
or
cold
you
will
find
them
corbeling
around
like
trojans
or
when
they
are
not
corbeling
they
may
be
toothing
i
too
thought
that
this
might
be
a
misprint
for
teething
but
it
is
spelled
toothing
throughout
the
book
so
i
guess
that
scrimshaw
knows
what
he
is
about
of
all
departments
of
bricklaying
i
should
think
that
it
would
be
more
fun
to
tooth
than
to
do
anything
else
but
it
must
be
tiring
work
i
suppose
that
many
a
bricklayer
wife
has
said
to
her
neighbor
i
am
having
a
terrible
time
with
my
husband
this
week
he
is
toothing
and
comes
home
so
cross
and
irritable
that
nothing
suits
him
another
thing
that
a
bricklayer
has
to
be
careful
of
according
to
the
author
and
i
have
no
reason
to
contest
his
warning
is
the
danger
of
stepping
on
spawls
if
there
is
one
word
that
i
would
leave
with
the
young
bricklayer
about
to
enter
his
trade
it
is
beware
of
the
spawls
my
boy
they
are
insidious
those
spawls
are
you
think
you
are
all
right
and
then
pouf
or
maybe
crash
would
be
a
better
descriptive
word
whatever
noise
is
made
by
a
spawl
when
stepped
on
is
the
one
i
want
perhaps
swawk
would
do
i
have
to
look
up
spawl
first
i
guess
well
anyway
there
you
have
practical
bricklaying
in
a
nutshell
of
course
there
are
lots
of
other
points
in
the
book
and
some
dandy
pictures
and
it
would
pay
you
to
read
it
but
in
case
you
have
time
just
skim
over
this
résumé
again
and
you
will
have
the
gist
of
it
xlvii
american
anniversaries
phillip
dillon
has
compiled
and
published
in
his
american
anniversaries
a
book
for
men
who
do
things
for
every
day
in
the
year
there
is
a
record
of
something
which
has
been
accomplished
in
american
history
for
instance
under
we
find
that
the
system
was
inaugurated
in
the
united
states
in
while
is
given
as
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
of
murfreesboro
or
stone
river
as
you
prefer
the
whole
book
is
like
that
just
one
surprise
after
another
what
for
instance
do
you
suppose
that
saturday
marked
the
completion
of
presuming
that
no
one
has
answered
correctly
i
will
disclose
after
consulting
dillon
book
that
july
marked
the
completion
of
the
year
since
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
breda
but
what
you
may
say
and
doubtless
are
saying
at
this
very
minute
what
has
the
treaty
of
breda
which
everyone
knows
was
signed
in
holland
by
representatives
of
england
france
holland
and
denmark
got
to
do
with
american
history
and
right
there
is
where
dillon
and
i
would
have
you
in
the
treaty
of
breda
acadia
or
nova
scotia
was
given
to
france
and
new
york
and
new
jersey
were
confirmed
to
england
so
you
see
inhabitants
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
after
all
who
is
should
have
especial
cause
for
celebrating
july
as
breda
day
for
if
it
had
been
for
that
treaty
we
might
have
belonged
to
poland
and
been
mixed
up
in
all
the
mess
that
is
now
going
on
over
there
i
must
confess
that
i
turned
to
the
date
of
the
anniversary
of
my
own
birth
with
no
little
expectation
of
course
i
am
not
so
very
well
known
except
among
the
tradespeople
in
my
town
but
i
should
be
willing
to
enter
myself
in
a
popularity
contest
with
the
treaty
of
breda
but
evidently
there
is
a
conspiracy
of
silence
directed
against
me
on
the
part
of
the
makers
of
anniversary
books
and
calendars
while
no
mention
was
made
of
my
having
been
born
on
considerable
space
was
given
to
recording
the
fact
that
on
that
date
in
a
patent
for
a
knitting
machine
was
issued
to
the
inventor
who
was
none
other
than
isaac
wixan
lamb
of
salem
mass
now
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
belittle
the
importance
of
knitting
or
the
invention
of
a
knitting
machine
i
know
some
very
nice
people
who
knit
a
great
deal
but
really
when
it
comes
to
anniversaries
i
see
where
isaac
wixon
lamb
gets
off
to
crash
in
ahead
of
me
or
a
great
many
other
people
that
i
could
name
and
it
does
help
any
either
to
find
that
james
fenimore
cooper
and
william
howard
taft
are
both
mentioned
as
having
been
born
on
that
day
or
that
the
chief
basic
patent
for
gasoline
automobiles
in
america
was
issued
in
to
george
selden
it
certainly
was
a
big
day
for
patents
but
one
realizes
more
than
ever
after
reading
this
section
that
you
have
to
have
a
big
name
to
get
into
an
anniversary
book
the
average
citizen
has
no
show
at
all
in
spite
of
these
rather
obvious
omissions
dillon
book
is
both
valuable
and
readable
especially
in
those
events
which
occurred
early
in
the
country
history
is
there
material
for
comparison
with
the
happenings
of
the
present
day
events
which
will
some
day
be
incorporated
in
a
similar
book
compiled
by
some
energetic
successor
of
dillon
for
instance
under
we
find
that
william
robinson
and
marmaduke
stevenson
were
banished
from
new
hampshire
on
the
charge
of
being
quakers
and
were
later
executed
for
returning
to
the
colony
imagine
and
on
wendell
phillips
delivered
his
first
abolition
speech
at
boston
in
faneuil
hall
as
a
result
of
which
he
got
himself
known
around
boston
as
an
undesirable
citizen
a
dangerous
radical
and
a
revolutionary
it
hardly
seems
possible
now
does
it
and
on
july
but
there
why
rub
it
in
xlviii
a
with
wells
in
the
february
bookman
there
is
an
informal
article
by
john
elliot
called
at
home
with
wells
in
which
we
are
let
in
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
wells
household
and
shown
as
his
friends
and
his
wife
call
him
at
play
it
is
an
interesting
glimpse
at
the
small
doings
of
a
great
man
but
there
is
one
feature
of
those
doings
which
has
an
ominous
sound
the
wells
that
everyone
loves
who
sees
him
at
easton
is
the
human
wells
the
family
wells
the
jovial
wells
wells
the
host
of
some
sunday
afternoon
party
for
a
distance
of
ten
or
twenty
miles
round
folks
come
on
sunday
to
play
hockey
and
have
tea
old
and
young
people
from
down
london
who
never
played
hockey
before
in
their
lives
country
farmers
and
their
daughters
and
everybody
else
who
lives
in
the
district
troop
over
and
bring
whoever
happens
to
be
the
guest
wells
is
delightful
to
them
all
he
does
give
a
rap
if
they
are
solid
tories
bolsheviks
liberals
or
men
and
women
of
no
political
leanings
can
you
play
hockey
is
all
that
matters
if
you
say
no
you
are
rushed
toward
a
pile
of
sticks
and
given
one
and
told
to
go
in
the
forward
line
if
you
say
yes
you
are
probably
made
a
vice
captain
on
the
spot
i
am
frank
to
confess
that
this
sounds
perfectly
terrible
to
me
i
imagine
a
worse
place
in
which
to
spend
a
than
one
where
your
host
is
always
boisterously
forcing
you
to
take
part
in
games
and
dances
about
which
you
know
nothing
a
guest
ought
to
be
ignored
allowed
to
rummage
about
alone
among
the
books
live
stock
and
cold
food
in
the
whenever
he
feels
like
it
and
not
rushed
something
good
could
be
done
using
the
famous
correspondence
as
a
base
but
not
here
into
whatever
the
family
itself
may
consider
a
good
time
in
such
a
household
as
the
wells
household
must
be
you
are
greeted
by
your
hostess
in
a
robust
manner
with
so
glad
you
on
time
the
match
begins
at
two
and
when
you
say
what
match
you
are
told
that
there
is
a
little
tennis
tournament
on
for
the
and
that
you
and
hank
are
scheduled
to
start
the
thing
off
with
a
bang
but
i
have
played
tennis
for
five
years
you
protest
thinking
of
the
delightful
privacy
of
your
own
little
hall
bedroom
in
town
never
mind
it
will
all
come
back
to
you
bill
has
got
some
extra
things
all
put
out
for
you
upstairs
so
you
start
off
your
by
making
a
dub
of
yourself
and
are
known
from
that
afternoon
on
by
the
people
who
did
catch
your
name
as
the
man
who
had
such
a
funny
serve
or
if
it
is
that
it
dancing
immediately
after
dinner
just
as
you
are
about
to
settle
down
for
a
comfortable
evening
by
the
fire
you
notice
that
they
are
rolling
back
the
rugs
you
suggest
with
a
nervous
little
laugh
oh
no
just
a
little
dancing
in
your
honor
and
then
you
tell
them
that
your
honor
will
be
satisfied
perfectly
without
dancing
that
you
have
danced
since
you
left
school
that
you
do
dance
very
well
or
that
you
have
hurt
your
foot
to
which
the
only
reply
is
an
encouraging
laugh
and
a
push
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
pox
on
both
your
house
parties
and
yet
in
a
way
that
is
just
what
one
might
expect
from
wells
he
has
done
the
same
thing
to
me
in
his
books
many
a
time
i
personally
have
but
little
facility
for
i
have
the
slightest
idea
of
how
one
would
go
about
making
things
better
and
yet
before
i
am
more
than
of
the
way
through
joan
and
peter
or
the
undying
fire
or
the
outline
of
history
wells
has
me
out
on
the
waving
a
stick
with
a
magnificent
enthusiasm
but
no
aim
rushing
up
and
down
and
calling
come
on
now
to
no
one
in
particular
no
matter
how
discouraging
things
seem
when
i
pick
up
a
wells
book
or
how
averse
i
may
be
to
launching
out
on
a
crusade
of
any
sort
i
always
end
by
walking
with
a
firm
step
to
the
door
feeling
somehow
that
i
have
grown
quite
a
bit
taller
and
much
handsomer
and
saying
quietly
meadows
my
suit
of
armor
please
the
one
with
a
shirt
and
a
purple
plume
this
of
course
is
silly
as
any
of
wells
critics
will
tell
you
it
is
the
effect
that
he
has
on
irresponsible
visionary
minds
but
if
all
the
irresponsible
visionary
minds
in
the
world
become
sufficiently
belligerent
through
a
continued
reading
of
wells
or
even
of
the
new
testament
who
knows
but
what
they
may
become
just
practical
enough
to
take
a
hand
at
running
things
they
could
do
much
worse
than
the
responsible
practical
minds
have
done
now
could
they
xlix
about
portland
cement
portland
cement
is
the
finely
pulverized
product
resulting
from
the
calcination
to
incipient
fusion
of
an
intimate
mixture
of
properly
proportioned
argillaceous
and
calcareous
materials
and
to
which
no
addition
greater
than
per
cent
has
been
made
subsequent
to
calcination
that
in
a
word
is
the
keynote
of
colin
campbell
how
to
use
cement
for
concrete
construction
in
case
you
should
never
read
any
more
of
the
book
you
would
have
that
but
to
the
reader
who
is
not
satisfied
with
this
taste
of
the
secret
of
cement
construction
and
who
reads
on
into
campbell
work
there
is
revealed
a
veritable
mine
of
information
and
in
the
light
of
the
recent
turn
of
events
one
might
even
call
it
significant
any
turn
of
events
will
do
the
first
chapter
is
given
over
to
a
plea
for
concrete
judging
from
the
claims
made
for
concrete
by
campbell
it
will
accomplish
everything
that
a
return
to
republican
administration
would
do
and
would
be
anywhere
near
so
costly
it
will
make
your
barn
fireproof
it
will
insure
clean
milk
for
your
children
it
will
provide
a
safe
housing
for
your
automobile
farm
prosperity
and
concrete
go
hand
in
hand
in
case
there
are
any
other
members
of
society
who
have
been
with
me
in
thinking
that
portland
cement
is
a
product
of
portland
or
portland
it
might
as
well
be
stated
right
here
and
now
that
america
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
founding
of
the
industry
and
that
the
lucky
portland
is
an
island
off
the
south
coast
of
england
it
was
a
bright
sunny
afternoon
in
may
when
joseph
aspdin
an
intelligent
bricklayer
of
leeds
england
was
carelessly
calcining
a
mixture
of
limestone
and
clay
as
bricklayers
often
do
on
their
days
off
that
he
suddenly
discovered
on
reducing
the
resulting
clinker
to
a
powder
that
this
substance
on
hardening
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
the
stone
found
in
the
quarries
on
the
isle
of
portland
how
joe
knew
what
grew
on
the
isle
of
portland
when
his
home
was
in
leeds
is
not
explained
maybe
he
spent
his
summers
at
the
portland
house
within
three
minutes
of
the
bathing
beach
at
any
rate
on
discovering
the
remarkable
similarity
between
the
mess
he
had
cooked
up
and
portland
stone
he
called
to
his
wife
and
said
eunice
come
here
a
minute
what
does
this
remind
you
of
the
usually
cheerful
brow
of
eunice
aspdin
clouded
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
that
night
up
at
bert
and
edna
she
ventured
no
no
my
dear
said
the
intelligent
bricklayer
slightly
irked
anyone
could
see
that
this
here
substance
is
a
dead
ringer
for
portland
stone
and
i
am
going
to
make
heaps
and
heaps
of
it
and
call
it
cement
it
is
little
enough
that
i
can
do
for
the
old
island
and
so
that
how
portland
cement
was
named
rumor
hath
it
that
the
first
portland
cement
in
america
was
made
at
allentown
in
but
i
would
want
to
be
quoted
as
having
said
that
but
i
will
say
that
the
total
annual
production
in
this
country
is
now
over
barrels
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
cement
is
usually
packed
in
cloth
sacks
although
sometimes
paper
bags
are
used
a
charge
is
made
for
packing
cement
in
paper
bags
the
books
says
these
of
course
are
not
redeemable
one
can
understand
their
not
wanting
to
take
back
a
paper
bag
in
which
cement
has
been
wrapped
the
wonder
is
that
the
bag
lasts
until
you
get
home
with
it
i
tried
to
take
six
cantaloups
home
in
a
paper
bag
the
other
night
and
had
a
bad
enough
time
of
it
cement
when
it
is
in
good
form
must
be
much
worse
than
cantaloup
and
the
redeemable
remnants
of
the
bag
must
be
negligible
but
why
charge
extra
for
using
paper
bags
that
seems
like
adding
whatever
it
is
you
add
to
injury
apologies
rather
than
extra
charge
should
be
in
order
however
i
suppose
that
these
cement
people
understand
their
business
i
shall
know
enough
to
watch
out
however
and
insist
on
having
whatever
cement
i
may
be
called
upon
to
carry
home
done
up
in
a
cloth
sack
not
in
a
paper
bag
if
you
please
i
shall
say
very
politely
to
the
clerk
l
open
bookcases
things
have
come
to
a
pretty
pass
when
a
man
ca
buy
a
bookcase
that
has
got
glass
doors
on
it
what
are
we
becoming
a
nation
of
weaklings
all
over
new
york
city
i
have
been
trying
to
get
something
in
which
to
keep
books
and
what
am
i
shown
curio
cabinets
inclosed
whatnots
museum
cases
in
which
to
display
fragments
from
the
neolithic
age
and
sarcophagi
for
dead
butterflies
but
i
am
apt
to
use
my
books
at
any
time
i
explain
to
the
salesman
i
never
can
tell
when
it
is
coming
on
me
and
when
i
want
a
book
i
want
it
quickly
i
do
want
to
have
to
send
down
to
the
office
for
the
key
and
i
do
want
to
have
to
manipulate
any
trick
and
open
up
a
case
as
if
i
were
getting
out
for
a
customer
i
want
a
bookcase
for
books
and
not
books
for
a
bookcase
i
really
do
say
all
those
clever
things
to
the
clerk
it
took
me
quite
a
while
to
think
them
up
what
i
really
say
is
timidly
you
any
bookcases
without
glass
doors
and
when
they
say
no
i
thank
them
and
walk
into
the
nearest
table
but
if
they
keep
on
getting
arrogant
about
it
i
shall
speak
up
to
them
one
of
these
fine
days
when
i
ask
for
an
bookcase
they
look
with
a
scornful
smile
across
the
salesroom
toward
the
mahogany
and
say
oh
no
we
do
carry
those
any
more
we
do
have
any
call
for
them
every
one
uses
the
ones
now
they
keep
the
books
much
cleaner
then
the
ideal
procedure
for
a
real
would
be
to
keep
his
books
in
the
original
box
snugly
packed
in
excelsior
with
the
lid
nailed
down
then
they
would
be
nice
and
clean
and
the
sun
could
get
at
them
and
ruin
the
bindings
faugh
try
saying
that
it
does
work
out
at
all
as
you
think
it
going
to
and
it
makes
you
feel
very
silly
for
having
tried
it
why
in
the
elder
days
bookcases
with
glass
doors
were
owned
only
by
people
who
filled
them
with
ten
volumes
of
a
pictorial
history
of
the
civil
war
including

with

that

when
you
see
it
and
you

have
to

illustration
i
thank
them
and
walk
into
the
nearest
table
a
bookcase
with
glass
doors
used
to
be
a
sign
that
somewhere
in
the
room
there
was
a
crayon
portrait
of
father
when
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
real
piece
of
glass
stuck
on
the
portrait
to
represent
a
diamond
stud
and
now
we
are
told
that
every
one
buys
bookcases
with
glass
doors
we
have
no
call
for
others
soon
we
shall
be
told
that
the
thing
to
do
is
to
buy
the
false
backs
of
bindings
such
as
they
have
in
stage
libraries
to
string
across
behind
the
glass
it
will
keep
us
from
reading
too
much
and
then
too
no
one
will
want
to
borrow
our
books
but
one
clerk
told
me
the
truth
and
i
am
just
fearless
enough
to
tell
it
here
i
know
that
it
will
kill
my
chances
for
the
presidency
but
i
can
not
stop
to
think
of
that
after
advising
me
to
have
a
carpenter
build
me
the
kind
of
bookcase
i
wanted
and
after
i
had
told
him
that
i
had
my
name
in
for
a
carpenter
but
was
due
to
get
him
until
late
in
the
fall
as
he
was
waiting
for
prices
to
go
higher
before
taking
the
job
on
the
clerk
said
that
it
it
the
price
you
see
the
furniture
manufacturers
can
make
much
more
money
out
of
a
bookcase
with
glass
doors
than
they
can
without
when
by
hanging
glass
doors
on
a
piece
of
furniture
at
but
little
more
expense
to
themselves
they
can
get
a
much
bigger
profit
what
the
sense
in
making
them
without
glass
doors
they
have
just
stopped
making
them
that
all
so
you
see
the
american
people
are
being
practically
forced
into
buying
glass
doors
whether
they
want
them
or
not
is
that
right
is
it
fair
where
is
our
personal
liberty
going
to
what
is
becoming
of
our
traditional
american
institutions
i
do
know
li
i
never
knew
very
much
about
anyway
and
i
certainly
had
no
inkling
that
a
had
to
be
so
deceitful
until
i
read
in
brooks
by
the
thing
is
appalling
evidently
the
sport
is
nothing
but
a
constant
series
of
compromises
with
one
better
nature
what
with
sneaking
about
pretending
to
be
something
that
one
is
not
trying
to
fool
the
fish
into
thinking
one
thing
when
just
the
reverse
is
true
and
in
general
behaving
in
an
underhanded
and
tricky
manner
throughout
the
day
the
very
first
and
evidently
the
most
important
exhortation
in
the
book
is
whatever
you
do
keep
out
of
sight
of
the
fish
is
that
open
and
is
it
honorable
trout
invariably
lie
in
running
water
with
their
noses
pointed
against
the
current
and
therefore
whatever
general
chance
of
concealment
there
may
be
rests
in
fishing
from
behind
them
the
moral
is
that
the
must
both
walk
and
fish
upstream
it
seems
as
if
a
lot
of
trouble
might
be
saved
the
fisherman
in
case
he
really
did
want
to
walk
upstream
but
had
to
get
to
some
point
downstream
before
to
adopt
some
disguise
which
would
deceive
the
fish
into
thinking
that
he
had
no
intention
of
catching
them
anyway
a
pair
of
blue
glasses
and
a
cane
would
give
the
effect
of
the
wearer
being
blind
and
harmless
and
could
be
thrown
aside
very
quickly
when
the
time
came
to
show
one
self
in
one
true
colors
to
the
fish
if
there
were
two
anglers
they
might
talk
in
loud
tones
about
their
dislike
for
fish
in
any
form
and
then
when
the
trout
were
quite
reassured
and
swimming
close
to
the
bank
they
could
suddenly
be
shot
with
a
pistol
but
a
little
further
on
comes
a
suggestion
for
a
much
more
elaborate
bit
of
subterfuge
the
author
says
that
in
the
early
season
trout
are
often
engaged
with
larvae
at
the
bottom
and
do
not
show
on
the
surface
it
is
then
a
good
plan
he
says
to
sink
the
flies
well
moving
in
short
jerks
to
imitate
nymphs
you
can
see
that
imitating
a
nymph
will
call
for
a
lot
of
rehearsing
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
moving
in
short
jerks
is
the
way
in
which
to
go
about
it
i
have
never
actually
seen
a
nymph
though
if
i
had
i
should
not
be
likely
to
admit
it
and
i
can
think
of
no
possible
way
in
which
i
could
give
an
adequate
illusion
of
being
one
myself
even
the
most
stupid
of
trout
could
easily
divine
that
i
was
masquerading
and
then
the
question
would
immediately
arise
in
its
mind
if
he
is
not
a
nymph
then
what
is
his
object
in
going
about
like
that
trying
to
imitate
one
he
is
up
to
no
good
i
be
bound
and
crash
away
would
go
the
trout
before
i
could
put
my
clothes
back
on
there
is
an
interesting
note
on
the
care
and
feeding
of
worms
on
page
one
hundred
and
fifty
worms
are
placed
in
a
tin
and
allowed
to
work
their
way
down
into
packed
moss
a
little
fresh
milk
poured
in
occasionally
is
sufficient
food
writes
in
the
style
of
holt
so
disposed
the
worms
soon
become
bright
lively
and
tough
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
one
should
want
to
have
bright
worms
so
long
as
they
do
know
that
they
are
bright
and
try
to
show
off
before
company
but
why
deliberately
set
out
to
make
them
tough
good
manners
they
may
not
be
expected
to
acquire
but
a
worm
with
a
cultivated
vulgarity
sounds
intolerable
imagine
very
tough
worms
all
crowded
together
in
one
tin
canaille
is
the
only
word
to
describe
it
i
suppose
that
it
is
my
ignorance
of
fishing
parlance
which
makes
the
following
sentence
a
bit
hazy
much
has
been
written
about
bringing
a
fish
downstream
to
help
drown
it
as
no
doubt
it
does
still
this
is
often
impracticable
i
can
think
of
nothing
more
impracticable
than
trying
to
drown
a
fish
under
any
conditions
upstream
or
down
but
i
suppose
that
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
and
in
at
least
one
of
his
passages
i
follow
him
perfectly
in
speaking
of
the
time
of
day
for
in
the
spring
he
says
diem
is
a
good
watchword
when
trout
are
in
the
humor
at
least
i
know
a
good
pun
when
i
see
one
lii
scouting
for
girls
scouting
for
girls
is
not
the
kind
of
book
you
think
it
is
the
verb
to
scout
is
intransitive
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact
instead
of
being
a
volume
of
advice
to
men
on
how
to
get
along
with
girls
it
is
full
of
advice
to
girls
on
how
to
get
along
without
men
that
is
within
reason
of
course
it
is
issued
by
the
girl
scouts
and
is
very
subtle
propaganda
i
ca
find
that
men
are
mentioned
anywhere
in
the
book
it
is
given
over
entirely
to
telling
girls
how
to
chop
down
trees
tie
knots
in
ropes
and
things
like
that
now
as
a
man
i
am
very
jealous
of
my
man
prerogative
of
chopping
down
trees
and
tying
knots
in
ropes
and
i
resent
the
teaching
of
young
girls
to
usurp
my
province
in
these
matters
any
young
girl
who
has
taken
one
lesson
in
will
be
able
to
make
me
appear
very
silly
at
it
after
two
lessons
she
could
tie
me
hand
and
foot
to
a
tree
and
go
away
with
my
watch
and
commutation
ticket
and
then
i
would
look
fine
would
i
small
wonder
to
me
that
i
hail
the
girl
scout
movement
as
a
menace
and
urge
its
being
nipped
in
the
bud
as
you
would
nip
a
viper
in
the
bud
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
there
were
russian
soviet
money
back
of
it
somewhere
a
companion
volume
to
scouting
for
girls
is
campward
ho
a
manual
for
girl
scout
camps
the
keynote
is
sounded
on
the
first
page
by
a
quotation
from
chaucer
beginning
that
aprille
with
his
schowres
swoote
the
drought
of
march
hath
perced
to
the
roote
and
bathus
every
veyne
in
swich
licour
of
which
vertue
engendred
is
the
one
can
almost
hear
the
girls
singing
that
of
an
evening
as
they
sit
around
the
campfire
tying
knots
in
ropes
it
is
really
an
ideal
camping
song
because
even
the
littlest
girls
can
sing
the
words
without
understanding
what
they
mean
but
it
really
lacks
the
lilt
of
the
marching
song
printed
further
on
in
the
book
this
is
to
be
sung
to
the
tune
of
where
do
we
go
from
here
boys
bear
this
in
mind
while
humming
it
to
yourself
song
where
do
we
go
from
here
girls
where
do
we
go
from
here
anywhere
our
captain
leads
we
follow
never
fear
the
world
is
full
of
dandy
girls
but
wait
till
we
appear
then
girl
scouts
girl
scouts
give
us
a
hearty
a
very
stirring
marching
song
without
doubt
but
what
would
they
do
if
the
leader
name
happened
to
be
something
like
mary
louise
abercrombie
or
elizabeth
van
der
water
they
just
could
have
a
captain
with
such
a
long
name
that
all
and
there
you
have
unfair
discrimination
creeping
into
your
camp
right
at
the
start
in
scouting
for
girls
there
is
some
useful
information
concerning
smoke
signals
in
case
you
are
lost
or
want
to
communicate
with
your
friends
who
are
beyond
shouting
distance
it
is
much
quicker
than
telephoning
to
build
a
clear
hot
fire
and
cover
it
with
green
stuff
or
rotten
wood
so
that
it
will
send
up
a
solid
column
of
black
smoke
by
spreading
and
lifting
a
blanket
over
this
smudge
the
column
can
be
cut
up
into
pieces
long
or
short
this
is
the
way
it
explains
it
in
the
book
but
it
does
sound
plausible
to
me
and
by
a
preconcerted
code
these
can
be
made
to
convey
tidings
for
instance
one
steady
smoke
means
here
is
camp
two
steady
smokes
mean
i
am
lost
come
and
help
me
three
smokes
in
a
row
mean
good
news
i
suppose
that
the
pollyanna
of
the
camping
party
is
constantly
sending
up
three
smokes
in
a
row
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
then
when
the
rest
of
the
outfit
have
raced
across
country
for
miles
to
find
out
what
the
good
news
is
she
probably
shows
them
with
great
enthusiasm
that
some
fringed
gentians
are
already
in
blossom
or
that
the
flicker
eggs
have
hatched
unfortunately
there
is
no
smoke
code
given
for
snappy
replies
but
in
the
next
paragraph
it
tells
how
to
carry
on
a
conversation
with
pistol
shots
one
of
these
would
serve
the

how

the

association

by
paul

macmillan
and
not
let
a
single

get
into
the
hands
of
a
customer
for
once
the
buying
public
reads
what
is
written
there
the
game
is
up
it
tells
all
about
how
to
sell
goods
to
people
how
to
appeal
to
their
weaknesses
how
to
exert
subtle
influences
which
will
win
them
over
in
spite
of
themselves
houdini
might
as
well
issue
a
pamphlet
giving
in
detail
his
methods
of
escape
as
for
the
merchants
of
this
country
to
let
this
book
remain
in
circulation
the
art
of
salesmanship
is
founded
according
to
ivey
on
first
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
goods
which
are
to
be
sold
and
second
a
knowledge
of
the
customer
by
knowing
the
customer
you
know
what
line
of
argument
will
most
appeal
to
him
there
are
several
lines
in
popular
use
first
is
the
appeal
to
the
instinct
of
social
the
customer
is
made
to
feel
that
in
order
to
preserve
her
social
standing
she
must
buy
the
article
in
question
she
must
be
made
to
feel
what
a
disparaged
social
self
would
mean
to
her
mental
comfort
it
is
reassuring
to
know
that
it
is
a
recognized
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
salesman
to
intimate
that
unless
you
buy
a
particular
article
you
will
have
to
totter
through
life
branded
as
the
i
have
always
taken
this
attitude
of
the
clerks
perfectly
seriously
in
fact
i
have
worried
quite
a
bit
about
it
in
the
store
where
i
am
allowed
to
buy
my
clothes
it
is
quite
the
thing
among
the
salesmen
to
see
which
one
of
them
can
degrade
me
most
they
intimate
that
while
they
have
no
legal
means
of
refusing
to
sell
their
goods
to
me
it
really
would
be
much
more
in
keeping
with
things
if
i
were
to
take
the
few
pennies
that
i
have
at
my
disposal
and
run
around
the
corner
to
some
little
haberdashery
for
my
shirts
and
ties
every
time
i
come
out
from
that
store
i
feel
like
ethel
barrymore
in
déclassée
much
worse
in
fact
for
i
have
any
good
looks
to
fall
back
upon
illustration
they
intimate
that
i
had
better
take
my
few
pennies
and
run
the
corner
to
some
little
haberdashery
but
now
that
i
know
the
clerks
are
simply
acting
all
that
scorn
in
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
my
instinct
for
the
preservation
of
my
social
self
i
can
face
them
without
flinching
when
that
pompous
old
boy
with
the
sandy
mustache
who
has
always
looked
upon
me
as
a
member
of
the
degenerate
juke
family
tries
to
tell
me
that
if
i
do
take
the
cravat
he
wo
be
responsible
for
the
way
in
which
decent
people
will
receive
me
when
i
go
out
on
the
street
i
will
reach
across
the
counter
and
playfully
pull
his
own
necktie
out
from
his
waistcoat
and
scream
i
know
you
you
old
rascal
you
got
that
stuff
from
page
of
of
retail
salesmanship
macmillan
other
traits
which
a
salesperson
may
appeal
to
in
the
customer
are
vanity
parental
pride
greed
imitation
curiosity
and
selfishness
one
really
gets
in
touch
with
a
lot
of
nice
people
in
this
work
and
can
bring
out
the
very
best
that
is
in
them
customers
are
divided
into
groups
indicative
of
temperament
there
is
first
the
impulsive
or
nervous
customer
she
is
easily
recognized
because
she
walks
into
the
store
in
a
quick
sometimes
jerky
manner
her
eyes
are
her
expression
is
intense
oftentimes
appearing
strained
she
must
be
approached
promptly
according
to
the
book
and
what
she
desires
must
be
quickly
ascertained
since
these
are
the
rules
for
selling
to
people
who
enter
the
store
in
this
manner
it
might
be
well
no
matter
how
lethargic
you
may
be
by
nature
to
assume
the
appearance
of
the
impulsive
or
nervous
customer
as
soon
as
you
enter
the
store
adopting
a
quick
even
jerky
manner
and
making
your
eyes
as
as
possible
with
an
intense
expression
oftentimes
appearing
strained
then
the
clerk
will
size
you
up
as
type
no
and
will
approach
you
promptly
after
she
has
quickly
filled
your
order
you
may
drop
the
impulsive
pose
and
assume
your
natural
slow
manner
again
whereupon
the
clerk
will
doubtless
be
highly
amused
at
having
been
so
cleverly
fooled
into
giving
quick
service
the
opposite
type
is
known
as
the
deliberate
customer
she
walks
slowly
and
in
a
dignified
manner
her
facial
expression
is
calm
and
poised
gestures
are
uncommon
but
if
existing
tend
to
be
slow
and
inconspicuous
she
can
wait
then
there
is
the
vacillating
or
indecisive
customer
the
confident
or
decisive
customer
this
one
should
be
treated
with
subtle
flattery
and
agreement
with
all
her
views
the
talkative
or
friendly
customer
and
the
silent
or
indifferent
one
all
these
have
their
little
weaknesses
and
the
perfect
salesperson
will
learn
to
know
these
and
play
to
them
there
seems
to
be
only
one
thing
left
for
the
customer
to
do
in
order
to
meet
this
concerted
attack
upon
his
personality
that
is
to
hire
some
expert
like
ivey
to
study
the
different
types
of
sales
men
and
women
and
formulate
methods
of
meeting
their
offensive
thus
if
i
am
of
the
type
designated
as
the
vacillating
or
indecisive
customer
i
ought
to
know
what
to
do
when
confronted
by
a
salesman
of
the
aristocratic
scornful
type
so
that
i
may
not
be
bulldozed
into
buying
something
i
do
not
want
if
i
could
only
find
such
a
book
of
instructions
i
would
go
tomorrow
and
order
a
black
cotton
engineer
shirt
from
that
salesman
and
bawl
him
out
if
he
raised
his
eyebrows
but
not
having
the
book
i
shall
go
in
and
without
a
murmur
buy
a
silk
shirt
for
and
slink
out
feeling
that
if
i
had
been
any
kind
of
sport
at
all
i
would
also
have
bought
that
cork
helmet
in
the
showcase
liv
you
in
the
window
of
the
grocery
store
to
which
i
used
to
be
sent
after
a
pound
of
mocha
and
java
mixed
and
a
dozen
of
your
best
oranges
there
was
a
cardboard
figure
of
a
clerk
in
a
white
coat
pointing
his
finger
at
the
as
i
remember
he
was
accusing
you
of
not
taking
home
a
bottle
of
moxie
and
pretty
guilty
it
made
you
feel
too
this
man
was
i
believe
the
pioneer
in
what
has
since
become
a
great
literary
movement
he
founded
the
you
mr
school
of
direct
appeal
it
is
strictly
an
advertising
property
and
has
long
been
used
to
sell
merchandise
to
people
who
never
can
resist
the
flattery
of
being
addressed
personally
when
used
as
an
advertisement
it
is
usually
accompanied
by
an
illustration
built
along
the
lines
of
the
pioneer
pointing
a
virile
finger
at
you
from
the
page
of
the
magazine
and
putting
the
whole
thing
on
a
personal
basis
by
addressing
you
as
you
mr
or
you
mr
the
appeal
is
instantaneous
in
straight
bound
in
book
form
and
sold
as
literature
this
moxie
talk
becomes
a
volume
of
inspirational
sermonizing
and
instead
of
selling
cooling
drinks
or
warming
applications
it
throws
dynamic
paragraph
after
dynamic
paragraph
into
the
fight
for
efficiency
concentration
and
personality
on
the
part
of
our
body
politic
a
homely
virtue
such
as
was
taught
us
at
our
mother
knee
or
across
our
mother
knees
at
the
age
of
four
in
a
dozen
or
so
simple
words
is
taken
and
blown
up
into
a
book
in
which
it
is
stated
very
impressively
in
a
series
of
short
snappy
sentences
all
saying
the
same
thing
such
a
book
is
called
for
instance
you
written
by
irving
allen
you
takes
pages
to
divulge
a
secret
of
success
it
would
not
be
fair
to
allen
to
give
it
away
here
after
he
has
spent
so
much
time
concealing
it
but
it
might
be
possible
to
give
some
idea
of
the
importance
of
allen
discovery
by
stating
one
of
my
own
somewhat
in
the
manner
in
which
he
has
stated
his
i
will
give
my
little
contribution
to
the
world
inspiration
the
title
of
hey
you
you
and
i
are
alone
no
do
try
to
get
away
that
door
is
locked
i
wo
hurt
you
much
what
i
want
to
do
is
make
you
see
yourself
i
want
you
when
you
put
down
this
book
to
say
i
know
myself
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
and
say
why
certainly
i
remember
you
addington
simms
of
seattle
you
old
rotary
club
dog
how
your
merger
and
the
only
way
that
you
can
ever
be
able
to
do
this
is
to
read
this
book
through
then
read
it
through
again
then
read
it
through
again
then
ring
dougherty
bell
and
ask
for
chester
now
let
get
down
to
business
i
knew
a
man
once
who
had
made
a
million
dollars
if
he
had
been
arrested
he
would
have
made
another
million
do
you
see
what
i
mean
if
not
go
back
and
read
that
over
a
second
time
it
worth
it
i
wrote
it
for
you
to
read
you
do
you
hear
me
you
if
you
want
to
know
the
secret
of
this
man
success
of
the
success
of
hundreds
of
other
men
just
like
him
if
you
want
to
make
his
success
your
success
you
must
first
learn
the
rule
what
is
this
rule
you
may
ask
go
ahead
and
ask
it
very
well
since
you
ask
it
is
a
rule
which
has
kept
morgan
what
he
is
it
is
a
rule
which
gives
john
rockefeller
the
right
to
be
known
as
the
baptist
man
alive
it
is
a
rule
which
is
responsible
for
the
continued
existence
of
every
successful
man
of
today
and
now
i
am
going
to
tell
it
to
you
you
the
you
that
you
know
the
real
you
are
going
to
learn
the
secret
can
you
bear
it
here
it
is
you
ca
win
if
you
breathe
under
water
read
that
again
read
it
backward
it
may
sound
simple
to
you
now
you
may
say
to
yourself
what
do
you
take
me
for
a
baby
boy
well
you
paid
good
money
for
this
book
did
you
lv
the
catalogue
school
without
wishing
in
the
least
to
detract
from
the
praise
due
to
sinclair
lewis
for
the
remarkable
accuracy
with
which
he
reports
details
in
his
main
street
it
is
interesting
to
speculate
on
how
other
books
might
have
read
had
their
authors
had
lewis
flair
for
minutiae
and
their
publishers
enough
paper
to
print
the
result
for
instance
carol
kennicott
the
heroine
whenever
she
is
overtaken
by
an
emotional
scene
is
given
to
looking
out
at
the
nearest
window
to
hide
her
feelings
whereupon
the
author
goes
to
great
lengths
to
describe
just
exactly
what
came
within
her
range
of
vision
nothing
escapes
him
even
to
shreds
of
excelsior
lying
on
the
ground
in
back
of
howland
gould
grocery
store
let
us
suppose
that
harriet
beecher
stowe
had
been
endowed
with
lewis
gift
for

had
indulged

in

crouched
blistering
in
the

cowed
as
they
were

legree
could
not

make
out
how

were

which
was
blowing
about
within

there
were
also
several
crumbs
of

shred
of
tobacco
which
had
fallen
from
the
pipe
of
some
negro

before
the
fire
had
consumed
more

had

by

none
of

ever

in

a

increase

induce

develop
better

in

of
ramsay
exceedingly
thorough
treatment
of
his
subject
there
is
one
type
of
house
organ
to
which
he
devotes
much
too
little
space
this
is
the

or
internal

and
is
designed
to
keep
the

happy
and
contented
with
their

and
to
spur
them
on
to
extra
effort
in
making
it
a

for
the

the
possibilities
of
this
sort
of
house
organ
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
industrial
unrest
are
limitless

for

usually
called

as

first
of

that
a

these

include
such
as
the

eddie

was
observed
last
saturday
evening
between
the
mystic
hours
of
with

said
party
in
a
tan

on

everyone
is
wondering
who
the
person
is
who
put
chocolate
peppermints
in
some
of
the

pockets
while
they
were
hanging
in
the
girls
rest
room
thursday
afternoon
it
being
so
hot
that
they
melted
and
practically
ruined
some
of
their
clothing
some
folks
have
a
funny
sense
of
humor
then
there
are
excerpts
from
speeches
made
by
the
rev
charles
aubrey
eaton
and
young
rockefeller
or
by
the
president
and
treasurer
of
the
diamond
motor
sales
corporation
saying
in
part
the
man
who
makes
good
in
any
line
of
work
is
the
man
who
gives
the
best
there
is
in
him
he
does
watch
the
clock
he
does
kick
when
he
fails
to
get
that
raise
that
he
may
have
expected
he
just
digs
into
the
job
harder
and
makes
the
dust
fly
and
when
some
one
comes
along
waving
a
red
flag
and
tries
to
make
him
stop
work
and
strike
for
more
money
he
turns
on
the
agitator
and
says
get
the
h
out
of
here
i
know
my
job
better
than
you
do
i
know
my
boss
better
than
you
do
and
i
know
that
he
is
going
to
give
me
the
square
deal
just
as
soon
as
he
can
see
his
way
clear
to
do
it
and
in
the
mean
time
i
am
going
to
work
that
is
the
kind
of
man
who
makes
good
and
then
there
are
efficiency
contests
with
the
force
divided
into
teams
trying
to
see
which
one
can
wrap
the
most
containers
or
stamp
the
largest
number
of
covers
in
the
week
the
winning
team
gets
a
felt
banner
and
their
names
are
printed
in
full
in
that
week
issue
of
pep
or
nosey
news
and
biographies
of
employees
who
have
been
with
the
company
for
more
than
fifty
years
with
photographs
and
a
little
notice
written
by
the
superintendent
saying
that
this
will
show
the
company
appreciation
of
gomble
loyal
and
unswerving
allegiance
to
his
duty
implying
that
any
one
else
who
does
his
duty
for
fifty
years
will
also
get
his
picture
in
the
paper
and
a
notice
by
the
superintendent
it
will
easily
be
seen
how
this
sort
of
house
organ
can
be
made
to
promote
good
feeling
and
esprit
de
corps
among
the
help
if
only
more
concerns
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
bring
this
message
of
weekly
or
monthly
good
cheer
to
their
employees
who
knows
but
what
the
whole
caldron
of
industrial
unrest
might
not
suddenly
simmer
down
to
mere
nothingness
it
has
been
said
that
all
that
is
necessary
is
for
capital
and
labor
to
understand
each
other
certainly
such
a
house
organ
helps
the
employees
to
understand
their
employers
perhaps
some
one
will
start
a
house
organ
edited
by
the
employees
for
circulation
among
the
bosses
containing
newsy

about
the

quotations
from
karl
marx

lvii
advice
to
writers
two
books
have
emerged
from
the
hundreds
that
are
being
published
on
the
art
of
writing
one
of
them
is
the
lure
of
the
pen
by
flora
klickmann
and
the
other
is
learning
to
write
a
collection
of
stevenson
meditations
on
the
subject
issued
by
scribners
at
first
glance
one
might
say
that
the
betting
would
be
at
least
eight
to
one
on
stevenson
but
for
real
solid
sensible
advice
in
the
matter
of
writing
and
selling
stories
in
the
modern
market
miss
klickmann
romps
in
an
easy
winner
it
must
be
admitted
that
john
william
rogers
who
collected
the
stevenson
material
warns
the
reader
in
his
introduction
that
the
book
is
not
intended
to
serve
as
a
macadamized
road
to
the
secret
of
writing
but
simply
as
a
help
to
those
who
want
to
write
and
who
are
interested
to
know
how
stevenson
did
it
so
we
must
compare
it
too
closely
with
miss
klickmann
book
which
is
quite
frankly
a
road
with
little
along
the
side
of
the
page
such
as
we
used
to
have
in
fiske
elementary
american
history
but
miss
klickmann
will
save
the
editors
of
the
country
a
great
deal
more
trouble
than
stevenson
advice
ever
will
she
is
the
editor
of
an
english
magazine
herself
and
has
suffered
where
miss
klickmann
enumerates
the
pitfalls
which
the
candidate
must
avoid
and
points
out
qualities
which
every
good
piece
of
writing
should
have
stevenson
writes
a
delightful
essay
on
the
profession
of
letters
or
a
gossip
on
romance
these
essays
are
very
inspiring
they
are
too
inspiring
they
make
the
reader
feel
that
he
can
go
out
and
write
like
stevenson
and
then
a
lot
of
stamps
are
wasted
and
a
lot
more
editors
are
cross
when
they
get
home
at
night
on
the
other
hand
the
result
of
miss
klickmann
book
is
to
make
the
reader
who
feels
a
writing
spell
coming
on
stop
and
give
pause
he
finds
enumerated
among
the
horrors
of
several
items
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
injecting
into
his
own
manuscript
with
considerable
pride
he
may
decide
that
the
old
job
in
the
is
so
bad
after
all
with
its
little
envelope
coming
in
regularly
every
week
as
a
former
member
of
the
local
union
i
will
give
one
of
three
rousing
cheers
for
any
good
work
that
miss
klickmann
may
do
in
this
field
one
writer
kept
very
busy
at
work
in
the
every
day
is
a
victory
for
literature
i
used
to
have
a
job
in
a
myself
so
i
know
if
for
instance
the
subject
under
discussion
were
that
of
learning
to
skate
miss
klickmann
might
advise
as
follows
do
try
to
skate
if
your
ankles
are
weak
get
skates
that
fit
you
a
skate
which
ca
be
put
on
when
you
get
to
the
pond
or
one
which
drags
behind
your
foot
by
the
strap
is
worse
than
no
skate
at
all
if
you
are
sure
that
you
are
ready
get
on
your
feet
and
skate
on
the
same
subject
scribners
might
bring
to
light
something
that
stevenson
had
written
to
a
young
friend
about
to
take
his
first
lesson
in
skating
reading
as
follows
to
know
the
secret
of
skating
is
indeed
i
have
always
thought
the
beginning
of
pleasance
it
comes
as
sweet
deliverance
from
the
tedium
of
indoor
isolation
and
brings
exhilaration
now
with
a
swift
glide
to
the
right
now
with
a
deft
swerve
to
the
left
now
with
a
deep
breath
of
healthy
air
now
with
a
long
exhalation
of
ozone
which
the
lungs
like
greedy
misers
have
cast
aside
after
draining
it
of
its
treasure
but
it
is
not
health
that
we
love
nor
exhilaration
that
we
seek
though
we
may
think
so
our
design
and
our
sufficient
reward
is
to
verify
our
own
existence
say
what
you
will
and
so
my
dear
young
friend
i
would
say
to
you
open
up
your
heart
sing
as
you
skate
sing
inharmoniously
if
you
will
but
sing
a
man
may
skate
with
all
the
skill
in
the
world
he
may
glide
forward
with
incredible
deftness
and
curve
backward
with
divine
grace
and
yet
if
he
be
not
master
of
his
emotions
as
well
as
of
his
feet
i
would
say
and
here
fate
steps
in
that
he
has
failed
there
is
of
course
plenty
of
good
advice
in
the
stevenson
book
but
it
is
much
better
as
pure
reading
matter
than
as
advice
to
the
young
idea
or
even
the
idea
it
may
have
been
all
right
for
stevenson
to
play
the
sedulous
ape
and
consciously
imitate
the
style
of
hazlitt
lamb
montaigne
and
the
rest
but
if
the
rest
of
us
were
to
try
it
there
would
result
a
terrible
plague
of
insufferably
artificial
and
affected
authors
all
playing
the
sedulous
ape
and
all
looking
the
part
on
the
whole
the
stevenson
book
makes
good
reading
and
miss
klickmann
gives
good
advice
lviii
the
effective
speaking
voice
joseph
mosher
begins
his
book
on
the
effective
speaking
voice
by
saying
among
the
many
developments
of
the
great
war
was
a
widespread
activity
in
public
speaking
mosher
to
adopt
a
technical
term
of
elocution
has
said
a
mouthful
whatever
else
the
war
did
for
us
it
raised
overnight
an
army
of
public
speakers
among
the
civilian
population
many
of
whom
seem
not
yet
to
have
received
their
discharge
it
is
the
aim
of
mosher
book
to
keep
this
landwehr
in
fighting
trim
and
aid
in
recruiting
its
ranks
possibly
against
the
next
war
until
every
nation
on
earth
has
subjected
its
public
speakers
to
a
devastating
operation
on
the
larynx
no
true
disarmament
can
be
said
to
have
taken
place
in
the
first
place
there
are
exercises
which
must
be
performed
by
the
man
who
would
have
an
effective
speaking
voice
exercises
similar
to
walter
camp
daily
dozen
you
stand
erect
with
the
chest
held
moderately
high
moderation
in
all
things
is
the
best
rule
to
follow
no
matter
what
you
are
doing
place
the
thumbs
just
above
the
hips
with
the
fingers
forward
over
the
waist
to
note
the
muscular
action
then
you
inhale
and
exhale
and
make
the
sound
of
ah
and
the
sound
of
and
if
you
are
you
say
slowly
ten
or
a
dozen
times
the
student
should
stop
at
once
if
signs
of
dizziness
appear
says
the
book
but
it
does
not
say
whether
the
symptoms
are
to
be
looked
for
in
the
student
himself
or
in
the
rest
of
the
family
the
author
does
the
public
a
rather
bad
turn
when
he
suggests
to
student
speakers
that
under
stress
they
might
use
what
is
known
as
the
orotund
the
orotund
quality
in
public
speaking
is
saved
for
passages
containing
grandeur
of
thought
when
the
orator
feels
the
need
of
a
larger
fuller
more
resonant
and
sounding
voice
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
sentiment
its
effect
is
somewhat
that
of
a
chant
and
here
is
how
you
do
it
the
chest
is
raised
and
tensed
the
cavities
of
the
mouth
and
pharynx
are
enlarged
more
breath
is
directed
into
the
nasal
chambers
and
the
lips
are
opened
more
widely
to
give
free
passage
to
the
increased
volume
of
voice
the
effectiveness
of
the
orotund
might
be
somewhat
reduced
if
the
audience
knew
the
conscious
mechanical
processes
which
went
to
make
it
up
or
if
in
the
congressional
record
instead
of
laughter
and
applause
the
vocal
technique
of
the
orator
could
be
indicated
how
few
would
be
the
wars
into
which
impassioned
senators
could
plunge
us
for
example
thurston
plea
for
intervention
in
cuba
the
time
for
action
has
come
tensing
the
chest
no
greater
reason
for
it
can
exist
tomorrow
than
exists
today
enlarging
the
cavities
of
the
mouth
every
hour
delay
only
adds
another
chapter
to
the
awful
story
of
misery
and
death
enlarging
the
cavities
of
the
pharynx
only
one
power
can
intervene
the
united
states
of
america
directing
more
breath
into
the
nasal
chambers
ours
is
the
one
great
nation
of
the
new
world
the
mother
of
republics
elevating
the
diaphragm
we
can
not
refuse
to
accept
this
responsibility
which
the
god
of
the
universe
has
placed
upon
us
as
the
one
great
power
of
the
new
world
we
must
act
raising
the
tongue
and
thrusting
it
forward
so
that
the
edges
of
the
blade
are
pressed
against
the
upper
grinders
what
shall
our
action
be
lifting
the
very
high
and
the
edges
of
the
tongue
blade
against
the
soft
palate
leaving
only
a
small
central
groove
for
the
passage
of
air
the
aspirate
quality
or
whisper
is
very
effective
when
well
handled
and
the
book
gives
a
few
exercises
for
practice
sake
try
whispering
a
few
of
them
if
you
are
sure
that
you
are
alone
in
the
room
you
will
sound
very
silly
if
you
are
overheard
a
i
ca
tell
just
how
it
happened
i
think
the
beam
fell
on
me
b
keep
back
wait
till
i
see
if
the
coast
is
clear
ask
the
man
next
to
you
if
he
let
me
see
his
programme
hark
what
was
that
it
too
steep
he
never
make
it
oh
this
is
terrible
for
the
cheery
evening
reading
if
you
happen
to
be
feeling
low
in
your
mind
let
me
recommend
that
section
of
the
effective
speaking
voice
which
deals
with
the
subdued
range
the
selections
for
the
include
the
following
nuggets
in
lighter
vein
the
wounded
soldier
the
death
of
molly
cass
the
little
garden
the
burial
of
little
nell
the
light
of
other
days
the
baby
is
dead
king
david
mourns
for
absalom
and
the
days
that
are
no
more
after
all
a
good
laugh
never
does
anyone
any
harm
lix
those
dangerously
dynamic
british
girls
it
is
difficult
to
get
into
rose
macaulay
dangerous
ages
once
you
discover
that
it
is
going
to
be
about
another
one
of
those
offensively
healthy
english
families
ever
since
britling
we
have
been
deluged
with
accounts
from
overseas
of
whole
droves
of
british
brothers
and
sisters
mothers
and
fathers
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
who
all
get
out
at
six
in
the
morning
and
play
hockey
all
over
the
place
each
has
some
strange
intimate
name
like
bim
or
pleda
or
goots
and
you
can
never
tell
which
are
the
brothers
and
which
the
sisters
until
they
begin
to
have
children
along
in
the
tenth
or
eleventh
chapter
in
dangerous
ages
they
swim
dozens
of
them
all
in
the
same
family
go
splashing
in
at
once
and
persist
in
calling
out
health
slogans
to
one
another
across
the
waves
there
are
and
and
and
and
one
or
two
very
old
ladies
whose
relationship
to
the
rest
of
the
clan
is
never
very
definitely
established
grandma
for
some
reason
or
other
does
go
in
swimming
that
day
doubtless
because
she
had
already
been
in
before
breakfast
and
her
suit
was
dry
these
dynamic
british
girls
are
always
full
of
ruddy
health
and
current
information
they
go
about
kidding
each
other
on
the
second
reading
of
the
home
rule
bill
or
fooling
in
their
girlish
way
about
the
chances
of
the
labor
candidate
in
the
coming
duncastershire
elections
it
is
getting
so
that
no
novel
of
british
life
will
be
complete
without
somewhere
in
its
pages
a
scene
like
the
following
a
chance
visitor
at
the
beetles
some
autumn
morning
along
about
five
might
have
been
surprised
to
see
a
trail
of
figures
winding
their
way
heatedly
across
the
meadow
no
one
but
a
chance
visitor
would
be
surprised
however
for
it
was
well
known
to
invited
guests
that
the
entire
willetts
family
ran
down
to
the
outskirts
of
london
and
back
every
morning
before
breakfast
a
matter
of
fourteen
miles

for

but
not
reckoning
on
the

was
no
longer
content
to
hobble
in
the
vanguard
with
grandpa
willetts
and
grandpa
old

who
still
insisted
on
running
although
she
had
long
since
been
put
on

muttered
grandpa
willetts
crashing
down
into
a
stone
quarry
at
which
exhibition
of
reaction
a
loud
chorus
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
entire
family
who
by
this
time
had
reached
nogroton
and
were
bursting
with
health
lx
books
and
other
things
for
those
to
whom
the
filigreed
covers
of
florence
barclay
books
bring
a
stirring
of
the
sap
and
a
fluttering
of
the
susceptible
heart
returned
empty
comes
as
a
languorous
relief
from
the
stolid
realism
of
most
writing
one
reads
it
and
swoons
and
on
opening
one
eyes
again
one
hears
old
family
retainers
murmuring
in
soft
retentive
accents
here
sip
some
of
this
my
lord
bring
the
roses
back
to
those
cheeks
and
the
strength
to
those
poor
limbs
it
elegant
that
all
there
is
to
it
elegant
returned
empty
was
the
inscription
on
the
wrappings
which
enfolded
the
tiny
but
aristocratic
form
of
a
left
on
the
steps
of
the
foundlings
institution
one
moonless
october
night
there
was
also
some
reference
to
luke
which
in
return
refers
to
five
sparrows
sold
for
two
farthings
what
more
natural
then
than
for
the
matron
to
name
the
little
one
luke
sparrow
luke
was
an
odd
boy
but
refined
so
odd
that
he
used
to
go
about
looking
in
at
people
windows
when
they
forgot
to
pull
down
the
shades
and
so
refined
that
he
never
wished
to
be
inside
with
them
but
one
night
when
he
was
thirty
years
old
he
looked
in
at
the
window
of
a
very
refined
and
elegant
mansion
and
saw
a
woman
in
the
simple
words
of
the
author
in
court
or
cottage
alike
she
would
be
queen
that
the
kind
of
woman
she
was
and
what
do
you
think
she
saw
luke
looking
in
not
only
saw
him
but
came
over
to
the
window
and
told
him
that
she
had
been
expecting
him
well
you
could
have
knocked
luke
over
with
a
feather
however
he
allowed
himself
to
be
ushered
in
by
the
butler
everything
in
the
house
was
elegant
like
that
and
up
to
a
room
where
he
found
evening
clothes
and
grand
things
of
that
nature
on
passing
a
box
of
books
which
stood
in
the
hall
he
read
the
name
on
it
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
of
course
the
minute
he
thought
what
an
unrefined
thing
it
was
to
do
he
stopped
but
it
was
too
late
he
had
already
seen
that
his
hostess
name
was
lady
tintagel
when
later
he
met
her
down
in
the
luxurious
she
was
just
as
refined
as
ever
and
so
was
he
they
both
were
so
refined
that
she
had
to
tell
the
butler
to
serve
the
fruit
in
the
oak
room
thomas
once
in
the
oak
room
she
told
him
her
strange
tale
it
seemed
that
he
was
her
husband
he
did
remember
it
but
he
was
he
had
been
drowned
some
years
before
and
she
had
wished
so
hard
that
he
might
come
back
to
life
that
finally
he
had
been
born
again
in
the
body
of
luke
sparrow
it
funny
how
things
work
out
like
that
sometimes
but
luke
who
as
has
been
said
before
was
an
odd
boy
took
it
very
hard
and
said
that
he
did
want
to
be
brought
back
to
life
not
even
when
she
told
him
that
his
name
was
now
sir
nigel
guido
cadross
tintagel
bart
he
became
very
cross
and
said
that
he
was
going
out
and
drown
himself
all
over
again
just
to
show
her
that
she
should
have
gone
meddling
with
his
spirit
life
he
was
too
refined
to
say
so
but
when
you
consider
that
he
was
just
thirty
and
his
wife
owing
to
the
difference
in
time
between
the
spirit
world
and
this
had
gone
on
growing
old
until
she
was
now
pushing
sixty
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
justice
on
his
side
but
of
course
she
was
lady
tintagel
and
all
the
lovers
of
florence
barclay
will
understand
that
that
is
something
so
after
reciting
tennyson
crossing
the
bar
at
her
request
credit
is
given
in
the
front
of
the
book
for
the
use
of
this
poem
and
only
rightly
too
for
without
it
the
story
could
never
have
been
written
he
goes
out
into
the
ocean
but
there
we
must
give
too
much
of
the
plot
away
all
that
one
need
know
is
that
luke
or
sir
nigel
as
you
wish
and
what
reader
of
florence
barclay
would
prefer
sir
nigel
was
so
cultured
that
he
said
nobody
in
the
whole
world
knows
it
save
you
and
i
and
referred
to
flotsam
and
jetson
as
he
was
swimming
out
into
the
path
of
the
rising
sun
jetsam
is
such
an
ugly
word
it
is
only
fitting
that
on
his
tombstone
lady
tintagel
should
have
had
inscribed
an
impressive
and
misquotation
from
the
bible
lxi
measure
your
mind
measure
your
mind
by
traube
and
frank
parker
stockbridge
is
apt
to
be
a
very
discouraging
book
if
you
have
any
doubt
at
all
about
your
own
mental
capacity
from
a
hasty
glance
through
the
various
tests
i
figure
it
out
that
i

if

i
shall

minutes

the
trouble
is
that
each
test
starts
off
so
easily
you
begin
to
think
that
you
are
so
good
that
no
one
has
ever
appreciated
you
there
is
for
instance
a
series
of
pictures
very
badly
drawn
too
frank
parker
stockbridge
you
think
you
are
so
smart
picking
flaws
with
people
intelligence
if
i
could
draw
a
better
head
than
the
one
on
page
i
would
throw
up
the
whole
business
at
any
rate
in
each
one
of
these
pictures
there
is
something
wrong
wholly
apart
from
the
drawing
you
are
supposed
to
pick
out
the
incongruous
feature
and
you
have
seconds
in
which
to
tear
the
pictures
to
pieces
the
first
one
is
easy
the
rabbit
has
one
human
ear
in
the
second
one
the
woman
eye
is
in
her
hair
pretty
soft
you
say
to
yourself
in
the
third
the
bird
has
three
legs
it
looks
like
a
cinch
following
in
quick
succession
come
a
man
with
his
mouth
in
his
forehead
a
horse
with
horns
a
mouse
with
rabbit
ears
etc
you
will
have
time
for
a
handspring
before
your
seconds
are
up
but
then
they
get
tricky
there
is
a
with
a
stamp
upside
down
well
what
wrong
with
that
certainly
there
is
no
affront
to
nature
in
a
stamp
upside
down
neither
is
there
in
a
man
looking
through
the
large
end
of
a
telescope
if
he
wants
to
you
ca
arbitrarily
say
at
the
top
of
the
page
mark
the
thing
that
is
wrong
and
then
have
a
picture
of
a
house
with
one
window
larger
than
all
the
others
and
expect
any
one
to
agree
with
you
that
it
is
necessarily
it
may
look
queer
but
so
does
the
whole
picture
you
ca
tell
the
big
window
may
open
from
a
room
that
needs
a
big
window
i
am
not
going
to
stultify
myself
by
making
things
wrong
about
which
i
know
none
of
the
facts
who
am
i
that
i
should
condemn
a
man
for
looking
through
the
large
end
of
a
telescope
personally
i
like
to
look
through
the
large
end
of
a
telescope
it
only
shows
the
state
of
personal
liberty
in
this
country
when
a
picture
of
a
man
looking
at
a
ship
through
the
large
end
of
a
telescope
is
held
before
the
young
and
branded
as
wrong
arguing
these
points
with
yourself
takes
up
quite
a
bit
of
time
and
you
get
so
out
of
patience
with
the
man
that
made
up
the
examination
that
you
lose
all
heart
in
it
then
come
some
pictures
about
which
i
am
frankly
in
the
dark
there
is
a
ford
car
with
a
rather
but
who
can
pick
out
any
one
feature
of
a
ford
and
say
that
it
is
wrong
it
may
look
wrong
but
i
bet
that
the
car
in
this
picture
as
it
stands
could
pass
many
a
big
car
on
a
hill
then
there
is
a
boy
holding
a
bat
and
while
his
position
is
all
that
a
coach
could
ask
the
only
radically
wrong
thing
that
i
can
detect
about
the
picture
is
that
he
is
evidently
playing
baseball
in
a
clean
white
shirt
with
a
necktie
and
a
rather
natty
cap
set
perfectly
straight
on
his
head
it
is
true
he
has
his
right
thumb
laid
along
the
edge
of
the
bat
but
maybe
he
likes
to
bunt
that
way
there
is
something
in
the
picture
that
i
do
get
i
am
afraid
just
as
there
is
in
the
picture
of
two
men
playing
golf
one
is
about
to
putt
aside
from
the
fact
that
his
putter
seems
just
a
trifle
long
i
should
have
to
give
up
my
guess
and
take
my
defeat
like
a
man
but
i
do
refuse
to
concede
anything
on
picture
no
here
a
baby
is
shown
sitting
on
the
floor
he
appears
to
be
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
incidentally
he
is
a
very
plain
baby
strewn
about
him
on
the
floor
are
the
toys
that
he
has
been
playing
with
there
are
a
ball
a
rattle
a
ring
a
doll
a
bell
and
a
pair
of
evidently
the
candidate
is
supposed
to
be
aghast
at
the
in
the
possession
of
such
a
small
child
the
man
who
drew
that
picture
had
evidently
never
furnished
playthings
for
a
small
child
i
can
imagine
nothing
that
would
delight
a
child
of
a
year
and
a
half
more
than
a
pair
of
to
chew
and
spin
and
hit
himself
in
the
face
with
they
could
also
be
dropped
on
daddy
when
daddy
was
lying
on
the
floor
in
an
attempt
to
be
sociable
of
all
the
toys
arranged
before
the
child
the
are
the
most
logical
i
suppose
that
the
author
of
this
test
would
insist
on
calling
a
picture
wrong
which
showed
a
baby
with
a
in
his
hand
or
an
overshoe
on
his
head
and
yet
a
photograph
of
the
public
library
could
not
be
more
true
to
life
that
is
my
great
trouble
in
taking
tests
and
examinations
of
any
kind
i
always
want
to
argue
with
the
examiner
because
the
examiner
is
always
so
obviously
wrong
lxii
the
in
humor
after
an
author
has
been
dead
for
some
time
it
becomes
increasingly
difficult
for
his
publishers
to
get
out
a
new
book
by
him
each
year
without
recourse
to
the
ouija
board
harper
brothers
manage
to
do
very
well
by
mark
twain
considering
that
all
they
have
to
work
with
are
the
books
that
he
wrote
when
he
was
alive
each
year
we
get
something
from
the
pen
of
the
famous
humorist
even
though
the
ink
has
faded
slightly
an
introduction
by
albert
bigelow
paine
and
a
hitherto
unpublished
photograph
as
a
frontspiece
and
there
you
are
the
season
new
mark
twain
book
this
season
it
is
moments
with
mark
twain
a
collection
of
excerpts
from
his
works
for
quick
and
handy
reading
we
may
look
for
further
books
in
this
series
in
to
be
entitled
half
hours
with
mark
twain
the
selections
a
trifle
longer
pleasant
with
mark
twain
indian
summer
with
mark
twain
there
is
an
interesting
comparison
between
this
sample
bottle
of
the
humor
of
mark
twain
and
that
contained
in
the
volume
entitled
something
else
again
by
franklin
adams
the
latter
is
a
volume
of
verse
and
burlesques
which
have
appeared
in
the
newspapers
and
magazines
in
the
days
when
mark
twain
was
writing
it
was
considered
good
form
to
spoof
not
only
the
classics
but
surplus
learning
of
any
kind
a
man
was
popularly
known
as
an
affected
cuss
when
he
could
handle
anything
more
erudite
than
a
nasal
past
participle
or
two
in
his
own
language
and
any
one
who
wanted
to
qualify
as
a
humorist
had
to
be
able
to
mispronounce
any
word
of
over
three
syllables
thus
we
find
mark
twain
in
the
selections
given
in
this
volume
having
amusing
trouble
with
the
pronunciation
of
michael
angelo
and
leonardo
da
vinci
expressing
surprise
that
michael
angelo
was
dead
picking
flaws
in
the
old
master
execution
and
complaining
of
the
use
of
foreign
words
which
have
their
equivalent
in
a
nobler
language
english
there
certainly
is
no
harm
in
this
school
of
humor
and
it
has
its
earnest
and
prosperous
exponents
today
in
fact
a
large
majority
of
the
people
still
like
to
have
some
one
poke
fun
at
the
things
in
which
they
themselves
are
not
proficient
whether
it
be
pronunciation
latin
or
bricklaying
but
there
is
an
increasingly
large
section
of
the
reading
public
who
while
they
may
not
be
expert
in
latin
composition
nevertheless
do
not
think
that
a
latin
word
in
itself
is
a
cause
for
laughter
a
french
phrase
thrown
in
now
and
then
for
metrical
effect
does
not
strike
them
as
essentially
an
affectation
and
they
are
willing
to
have
references
made
to
characters
whose
native
language
may
not
have
been
that
noblest
of
all
languages
our
native
tongue
that
such
a
school
of
readers
exists
is
proved
by
the
popularity
of
verses
and
prose
if
any
one
had
told
mark
twain
that
a
man
could
run
a
daily
newspaper
column
in
new
york
and
amass
any
degree
of
fame
through
translations
of
the
odes
of
horace
into
the
vernacular
the
veteran
humorist
would
probably
have
slapped
albert
bigelow
paine
on
the
back
and
taken
the
next
boat
for
bermuda
and
yet
in
something
else
again
we
find
some
sixteen
translations
of
horace
and
other
furriners
exotic
phrases
such
as
eheu
fugaces
and
ex
parte
used
without
making
faces
over
them
and
a
popular
exposition
of
highly
technical
verse
forms
which
james
russell
lowell
and
hal
longfellow
would
have
considered
terrifically
and
yet
thousands
of
american
business
men
quote
to
thousands
of
other
american
business
men
every
morning
can
it
be
said
that
the
american
people
are
not
so
as
they
like
to
pretend
there
is
a
great
deal
of
affectation
in
this
homespun
frame
of
mind
and
many
a
man
makes
believe
that
he
does
know
things
simply
because
no
one
has
ever
written
about
them
in
the
american
magazine
if
the
truth
were
known
we
are
all
a
great
deal
better
educated
than
we
will
admit
and
the
derisive
laughter
with
which
we
greet
signs
of
culture
is
sometimes
very
hollow
in
we
find
a
combination
which
makes
it
possible
for
us
to
admit
our
learning
and
still
be
held
honorable
men
it
is
a
good
sign
that
his
following
is
increasing
lxiii
business
letters
a
on
english
composition
giving
examples
of
good
and
bad
is
always
a
mine
of
possibilities
for
one
given
to
ruminating
and
with
nothing
in
particular
to
do
in
business
english
the
specimen
letters
are
unusually
interesting
it
seems
almost
as
if
the
authors
wallace
edgar
bartholomew
and
floyd
hurlbut
had
selected
their
examples
with
a
view
to
their
fiction
possibilities
it
also
seems
to
the
reader
as
if
he
were
opening
someone
else
mail
for
instance
the
following
is
given
as
a
type
of
very
short
letter
well
placed
richard
green
employment
department
travellers
insurance
chicago
dear
green
the
young
man
about
whom
you
inquire
has
much
native
ability
and
while
in
our
employ
proved
himself
a
master
of
office
routine
i
regret
to
say
however
that
he
left
us
under
circumstances
that
would
not
justify
our
recommending
him
to
you
cordially
yours
thompson
now
i
want
to
know
what
those
circumstances
were
and
in
lieu
of
the
facts
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
have
to
imagine
some
circumstances
for
myself
personally
i
do
believe
that
the
young
man
was
to
blame
bad
companions
maybe
or
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
he
was
shielding
someone
else
perhaps
a
young
lady
stenographer
with
whom
he
was
in
love
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
am
sure
that
this
was
the
secret
of
the
whole
thing
you
see
he
was
a
good
worker
and
had
thompson
admits
proved
himself
a
master
of
office
routine
although
thompson
does
say
so
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
been
promoted
very
shortly
and
then
he
fell
in
love
with
a
little
stenographer
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
she
had
an
invalid
mother
at
home
and
was
probably
trying
to
save
enough
money
to
send
her
father
to
college
and
whatever
she
did
it
could
have
been
so
very
bad
for
she
was
such
a
nice
girl
well
at
any
rate
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
young
man
while
he
was
arranging
the
pads
of
paper
for
the
regular
monday
morning
conference
overheard
the
telling
about
this
affair
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
a
matter
of
carelessness
in
the
payroll
and
saying
that
he
considered
the
little
girl
dishonest
at
this
the
young
man
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looking
the
squarely
in
the
eye
said
no
hostetter
it
was
i
who
did
it
and
i
will
take
the
consequences
and
i
want
it
understood
that
no
finger
of
suspicion
shall
be
pointed
at
agnes
fairchild
than
whom
no
truer
sweeter
girl
ever
lived
i
am
sorry
to
hear
this
ralph
said
hostetter
you
know
what
this
means
i
do
sir
said
ralph
and
turned
to
look
out
over
the
of
the
city
biting
his
under
lip
very
tight
and
on
saturday
ralph
left
since
then
he
has
applied
at
countless
places
for
work
but
always
they
have
written
to
his
old
employer
thompson
for
a
reference
and
have
received
a
letter
similar
to
the
one
given
here
as
an
example
naturally
they
have
not
felt
like
taking
him
on
you
can
not
blame
them
and
in
a
way
you
can
not
blame
thompson
you
see
hostetter
did
tell
thompson
all
the
circumstances
of
the
affair
he
just
said
that
ralph
had
confessed
to
responsibility
for
the
payroll
if
thompson
had
been
there
at
the
time
i
am
sure
that
he
would
have
divined
that
ralph
was
shielding
miss
fairchild
for
thompson
liked
ralph
you
can
see
that
from
his
letter
but
as
it
stands
now
things
are
pretty
black
for
the
boy
and
it
certainly
seems
as
if
in
this
great
city
there
ought
to
be
some
one
who
will
give
him
a
job
without
writing
to
thompson
about
him
this
department
will
be
open
as
a
for
offers
of
work
for
a
young
man
of
great
native
ability
and
master
of
office
routine
who
is
just
at
present
unfortunately
unable
to
give
any
references
but
who
will
i
am
quite
sure
justify
any
trust
that
may
be
placed
in
him
in
the
future
