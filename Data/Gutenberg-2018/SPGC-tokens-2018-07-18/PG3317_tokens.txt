preface
in
this
book
i
have
written
about
some
aspects
of
the
war
which
i
believe
the
world
must
know
and
remember
not
only
as
a
memorial
of
men
courage
in
tragic
years
but
as
a
warning
of
what
will
happen
again
surely
if
a
heritage
of
evil
and
of
folly
is
not
cut
out
of
the
hearts
of
peoples
here
it
is
the
reality
of
modern
warfare
not
only
as
it
appears
to
british
soldiers
of
whom
i
can
tell
but
to
soldiers
on
all
the
fronts
where
conditions
were
the
same
what
i
have
written
here
does
not
cancel
nor
alter
nor
deny
anything
in
my
daily
narratives
of
events
on
the
western
front
as
they
are
now
published
in
book
form
they
stand
i
may
claim
sincerely
and
humbly
as
a
truthful
accurate
and
tragic
record
of
the
battles
in
france
and
belgium
during
the
years
of
war
broadly
pictured
out
as
far
as
i
could
see
and
know
my
duty
then
was
that
of
a
chronicler
not
arguing
why
things
should
have
happened
so
nor
giving
reasons
why
they
should
not
happen
so
but
describing
faithfully
many
of
the
things
i
saw
and
narrating
the
facts
as
i
found
them
as
far
as
the
censorship
would
allow
after
early
hostile
days
it
allowed
nearly
all
but
criticism
protest
and
of
the
figures
of
loss
the
purpose
of
this
book
is
to
get
deeper
into
the
truth
of
this
war
and
of
all
war
not
by
a
more
detailed
narrative
of
events
but
rather
as
the
truth
was
revealed
to
the
minds
of
men
in
many
aspects
out
of
their
experience
and
by
a
plain
statement
of
realities
however
painful
to
add
something
to
the
world
knowledge
out
of
which
men
of
may
try
to
shape
some
new
system
of
relationship
between
one
people
and
another
some
new
code
of
international
morality
preventing
or
at
least
postponing
another
massacre
of
youth
like
that
five
sacrifice
of
boys
of
which
i
was
a
witness
part
one
observers
and
commanders
i
when
germany
threw
down
her
challenge
to
russia
and
france
and
england
knew
that
her
imperial
power
would
be
one
of
the
prizes
of
german
victory
the
common
people
did
not
think
this
at
first
but
saw
only
the
outrage
to
belgium
a
brutal
attack
on
civilization
and
a
glorious
adventure
some
newspaper
correspondents
were
sent
out
from
london
to
report
the
proceedings
and
i
was
one
of
them
we
went
in
civilian
clothes
without
military
passports
the
war
office
was
not
giving
any
with
bags
of
money
which
might
be
necessary
for
the
hire
of
hotel
life
and
the
bribery
of
doorkeepers
in
the
antechambers
of
war
as
some
of
us
had
gone
to
the
balkan
war
and
others
the
old
guard
of
war
correspondents
besieged
the
war
office
for
official
recognition
and
were
insulted
day
after
day
by
junior
who
knew
that
k
hated
these
men
and
thought
the
press
ought
to
be
throttled
in
time
of
war
or
they
were
beguiled
into
false
hopes
by
officials
who
hoped
to
go
in
charge
of
them
and
were
told
to
buy
horses
and
and
be
ready
to
start
at
a
moment
notice
for
the
front
the
moment
notice
was
postponed
for
months
the
younger
ones
did
not
wait
for
it
they
took
their
chance
of
seeing
something
without
authority
and
made
wild
desperate
efforts
to
break
through
the
barrier
that
had
been
put
up
against
them
by
french
and
british
staffs
in
the
zone
of
war
many
of
them
were
arrested
put
into
prison
let
out
caught
again
in
forbidden
places
rearrested
and
expelled
from
france
that
was
after
fantastic
adventures
in
which
they
saw
what
war
meant
in
civilized
countries
where
vast
populations
were
made
fugitives
of
fear
where
millions
of
women
and
children
and
old
people
became
wanderers
along
the
roads
in
a
tide
of
human
misery
with
the
red
flame
of
war
behind
them
and
following
them
and
where
the
first
battalions
of
youth
so
gay
in
their
approach
to
war
so
confident
of
victory
so
careless
of
the
dangers
which
they
did
not
know
came
back
maimed
and
mangled
and
blinded
and
wrecked
in
the
backwash
of
retreat
which
presently
became
a
spate
through
belgium
and
the
north
of
france
swamping
over
many
cities
and
thousands
of
villages
and
many
fields
those
young
who
had
set
out
in
a
spirit
of
adventure
went
back
to
fleet
street
with
a
queer
look
in
their
eyes
unable
to
write
the
things
they
had
seen
unable
to
tell
them
to
people
who
had
not
seen
and
could
not
understand
because
there
was
no
code
of
words
which
would
convey
the
picture
of
that
wild
agony
of
peoples
that
smashing
of
all
civilized
laws
to
men
and
women
who
still
thought
of
war
in
terms
of
heroic
pageantry
had
a
good
time
asked
a
colleague
along
the
corridor
hardly
waiting
for
an
answer
a
good
time
god
did
people
think
it
was
amusing
to
be
an
onlooker
of
one
of
them
remembered
a
lady
of
france
with
a
small
boy
who
had
fled
from
charleville
which
was
in
flames
and
smoke
she
was
weak
with
hunger
with
dirty
and
bedraggled
skirts
on
her
flight
and
she
had
heard
that
her
husband
was
in
the
battle
that
was
now
being
fought
round
their
own
town
she
was
brave
pointed
out
the
line
of
the
german
advance
on
the
map
and
it
was
in
a
crowded
with
french
soldiers
and
then
burst
into
wild
weeping
clasping
the
hand
of
an
english
so
that
her
nails
dug
into
his
flesh
i
remember
her
still
courage

the

dead
and
wounded
on
their
wagons
cuirassiers
stumbled
as
they
led
their
tired
horses
crowds
of
people
with
white
faces
like
ghosts
in
the
darkness
stared
at
their
men
retreating
like
this
through
their
city
and
knew
that
the
enemy
was
close
behind
nous
sommes
perdus
whispered
a
woman
and
gave
a
wailing
cry
people
were
fighting
their
way
into
railway
trucks
at
every
station
for
hundreds
of
miles
across
northern
france
women
were
beseeching
a
place
for
the
sake
of
their
babes
there
was
no
food
for
them
on
journeys
of
nineteen
hours
or
more
they
fainted
with
heat
and
hunger
an
old
woman
died
and
her
corpse
blocked
up
the
lavatory
at
night
they
slept
on
the
pavements
in
cities
invaded
by
fugitives
at
furnes
in
belgium
and
at
dunkirk
on
the
coast
of
france
there
were
columns
of
ambulances
bringing
in
an
endless
tide
of
wounded
they
were
laid
out
stretcher
by
stretcher
in
five
hundred
at
a
time
some
of
their
faces
were
masks
of
clotted
blood
some
of
their
bodies
were
horribly
torn
they
breathed
with
a
hard
snuffle
a
foul
smell
came
from
them
at
chartres
they
were
swilling
over
the
station

with
disinfecting
fluid
after
getting
through
with

the
french

it
was
during
the
first
battle
of
the
marne
it
is
impossible
said
the
french
doctor
four
hundred
thousand
people
were
in
flight
from
antwerp
into
which
big
shells
were
falling
as
english
correspondents
flattened
themselves
against
the
walls
and
said

two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
coming
across
the
scheldt
in

invaded
one
village
in

they
had
no
food
children
were
mad
with
fright
young
mothers
had
no

in
their

it
was
cold
at
night
and
there
were
only
a
few
and

and
in
them
were
crowds
of
fugitives
the
odor
of
human
filth
exuded
from
them

i
smell
it
now

sicken

answering

over

these
cries
went
up
to
the
blue
sky
of
france
in
august
of
they
were
the
cries
of
agony
in
war
afterward
i
went
across
the
fields
where
they
fought
and
saw
their
bodies
and
their
graves
and
the
proof
of
the
victory
that
saved
france
and
us
the
german
dead
had
been
gathered
into
heaps
like
autumn
leaves
they
were
soaked
in
petrol
and
oily
smoke
was
rising
from
them
that
was
after
the
retreat
from
mons
and
the
french
retreat
along
all
their
line
and
the
thrust
that
drew
very
close
to
paris
when
i
saw

little

keeping

parched
with

with

wounds
tied
round
with
rags
with
blistered

french
soldiers
bearded
dirty
thirsty
as

crowded
the
station

they
too
had
been
retreating

we

give

knock

paris

de

vie
in
beauvais
there
was
hardly
a
living
soul
when
three
english
correspondents
went
there
after
escape
from
amiens
now
in
german
hands
a
tall
cuirassier
stood
by
some
bags
of
gunpowder
ready
to
blow
up
the
bridge
the
streets
were
strewn
with
barbed
wire
and
broken
bottles
in
paris
there
was
a
great
fear
and
solitude
except
where
crowds
stormed
the
railway
stations
for
escape
and
where
french
and
british
soldiers
stragglers
all
drank
together
and
sang
above
their
broken
glasses
and
cursed
the
war
and
the
germans
and
down
all
the
roads
from
the
front
on
every
day
in
every
month
of
that
first
six
months
of
war
as
afterward
came
back
the
tide
of
wounded
wounded
everywhere
maimed
men
at
every
junction
hospitals
crowded
with
blind
and
dying
and
moaning
men
had
an
interesting
time
asked
a
man
i
wanted
to
kill
because
of
his
smug
ignorance
his
damnable
indifference
his
impregnable
stupidity
of
cheerfulness
in
this
world
of
agony
i
had
changed
the
clothes
which
were
smeared
with
blood
of
french
and
belgian
soldiers
whom
i
had
helped
in
a
week
of
strange
adventure
to
carry
to
the
surgeons
as
an
onlooker
of
war
i
hated
the
people
who
had
not
seen
because
they
could
not
understand
all
these
things
i
had
seen
in
the
first
nine
months
i
put
down
in
a
book
called
the
soul
of
the
war
so
that
some
might
know
but
it
was
only
a
few
who
understood
ii
in
the
war
office
at
last
moved
in
the
matter
of
war
correspondents
lord
kitchener
prejudiced
against
them
was
being
broken
down
a
little
by
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
mentioned
from
time
to
time
by
members
of
the
government
which
demanded
more
news
of
their
men
in
the
field
than
was
given
by
bald
communiqués
from
general
headquarters
and
by
an
who
as
one
paper
had
the
audacity
to
say
wrote
nothing
but
even
the
enormous
impregnable
stupidity
of
our
high
command
on
all
matters
of
psychology
was
penetrated
by
a
vague
notion
that
a
few
writing
fellows
might
be
sent
out
with
permission
to
follow
the
armies
in
the
field
under
the
strictest
censorship
in
order
to
silence
the
popular
clamor
for
more
news
dimly
and
nervously
they
apprehended
that
in
order
to
stimulate
the
recruiting
of
the
new
army
now
being
called
to
the
colors
by
vulgar
appeals
to
sentiment
and
passion
it
might
be
well
to
write
up
the
glorious
side
of
war
as
it
could
be
seen
at
the
base
and
in
the
organization
of
transport
without
of
course
any
allusion
to
dead
or
dying
men
to
the
ghastly
failures
of
distinguished
generals
or
to
the
filth
and
horror
of
the
battlefields
they
could
not
understand
nor
did
they
ever
understand
these
soldiers
of
the
old
school
that
a
nation
which
was
sending
all
its
sons
to
the
field
of
honor
desired
with
a
deep
and
poignant
craving
to
know
how
those
boys
of
theirs
were
living
and
how
they
were
dying
and
what
suffering
was
theirs
and
what
chances
they
had
against
their
enemy
and
how
it
was
going
with
the
war
which
was
absorbing
all
the
energy
and
wealth
of
the
people
at
home
why
do
they
trust
their
leaders
asked
the
army
chiefs
why
they
leave
it
to
us
we
do
trust
you
with
some
misgivings
thought
the
people
and
we
do
leave
it
to
you
though
you
seem
to
be
making
a
mess
of
things
but
we
want
to
know
what
we
have
a
right
to
know
and
that
is
the
life
and
progress
of
this
war
in
which
our
men
are
engaged
we
want
to
know
more
about
their
heroism
so
that
it
shall
be
remembered
by
their
people
and
known
by
the
world
about
their
agony
so
that
we
may
share
it
in
our
hearts
and
about
the
way
of
their
death
so
that
our
grief
may
be
softened
by
the
thought
of
their
courage
we
will
not
stand
for
this
anonymous
war
and
you
are
wasting
time
by
keeping
it
secret
because
the
imagination
of
those
who
have
not
joined
can
not
be
fired
by
cold
lines
which
say
is
nothing
to
report
on
the
western
front
in
march
of
i
went
out
with
the
first
body
of
accredited
war
correspondents
and
we
saw
some
of
the
bad
places
where
our
men
lived
and
died
and
the
traffic
to
the
lines
and
the
mechanism
of
war
in
fixed
positions
as
were
then
established
after
the
battle
of
the
marne
and
the
first
battle
of
ypres
even
then
it
was
only
an
experimental
visit
it
was
not
until
june
of
that
year
after
an
adventure
on
the
french
front
in
the
champagne
that
i
received
full
credentials
as
a
war
correspondent
with
the
british
armies
on
the
western
front
and
joined
four
other
men
who
had
been
selected
for
this
service
and
began
that
long
innings
as
an
authorized
onlooker
of
war
which
ended
after
long
and
dreadful
years
with
the
army
of
occupation
beyond
the
rhine
iii
in
the
very
early
days
we
lived
in
a
small
old
house
called
by
courtesy
a
chateau
in
the
village
of
tatinghem
near
general
headquarters
at
afterward
we
shifted
our
quarters
from
time
to
time
according
to
the
drift
of
battle
and
our
convenience
it
was
very
peaceful
there
amid
fields
of
standing
corn
where
peasant
women
worked
while
their
men
were
fighting
but
in
the
supplied
us
by
the
army
with
military
drivers
all
complete
it
was
a
quick
ride
over
cassel
hill
to
the
edge
of
the
ypres
salient
and
the
farthest
point
where
any
car
could
go
without
being
seen
by
a
watchful
enemy
and
blown
to
bits
at
a
signal
to
the
guns
then
we
walked
up
sinister
roads
or
along
communication
trenches
to
the
in
the
front
line
or
into
places
like
plug
street
wood
and
kemmel
village
and
the
ruins
of
vermelles
and
the
lines
by
neuve
chapelle
the
of
british
armies
where
always
birds
of
death
were
on
the
wing
screaming
with
high
and
rising
notes
before
coming
to
earth
with
the
cough
that
killed
after
hours
in
those
where
boys
of
the
new
army
were
learning
the
lessons
of
war
in
dugouts
and
ditches
under
the
range
of
german
guns
back
again
to
the
little
white
chateau
at
tatinghem
with
a
sweet
scent
of
flowers
from
the
fields
and
nightingales
singing
in
the
woods
and
a
bell
tinkling
for
benediction
in
the
old
church
tower
beyond
our
gate
said
the
colonel
our
first
chief
before
driving
in
for
a
late
visit
to
we
will
go
to
armentieres
and
see
how
the
boys
are
shaping
in
the
line
up
there
it
ought
to
be
the
colonel
was
profoundly
interested
in
the
technic
of
war
in
its
organization
of
supplies
and
transport
and
methods
of
command
he
was
a
regular
of
the
indian
army
a
soldier
by
blood
and
caste
and
training
and
the
noblest
type
of
the
old
school
of
imperial
officer
with
obedience
to
command
as
a
religious
instinct
of
stainless
honor
i
think
in
small
things
as
well
as
great
with
a
deep
love
of
england
and
a
belief
and
pride
in
her
imperial
destiny
to
govern
many
peoples
for
their
own
good
and
with
the
narrowness
of
such
belief
his
imagination
was
limited
to
the
boundaries
of
his
professional
interests
though
now
and
then
his
humanity
made
him
realize
in
a
perplexed
way
greater
issues
at
stake
in
this
war
than
the
challenge
to
british
empiry
one
day
when
we
were
walking
through
the
desolation
of
a
battlefield
with
the
smell
of
human
corruption
about
us
and
men
crouched
in
chalky
ditches
below
their
breastworks
of
he
turned
to
a
colleague
of
mine
and
said
in
a
startled
way
this
must
never
happen
again
never
it
will
never
happen
again
for
him
as
for
many
others
he
was
too
tall
for
the
trenches
and
one
day
a
german
sniper
saw
the
red
glint
of
his
he
was
on
the
staff
of
the
corps
and
thought
a
gay
bird
so
he
fell
and
in
our
mess
when
the
news
came
we
were
sad
at
his
going
and
one
of
our
orderlies
who
had
been
his
wept
as
he
waited
on
us
late
at
night
the
colonel
that
first
chief
of
ours
used
to
come
home
from
as
all
men
called
general
headquarters
with
a
sense
of
mystery
power
and
inexplicable
industry
accomplishing
what
in
those
initials
he
came
back
with
a
cheery
shout
of
fine
weather
or
a
starry
night
and
all
well
looking
fine
and
soldierly
as
the
glare
of
his
headlights
shone
on
his
tall
figure
with
red
tabs
and
a
colored
armlet
but
that
cheeriness
covered
secret
worries
night
after
night
in
those
early
weeks
of
our
service
he
sat
in
his
little
office
talking
earnestly
with
the
press
officers
our
censors
they
seemed
to
be
arguing
debating
protesting
about
secret
influences
and
hostilities
surrounding
us
and
them
i
could
only
guess
what
it
was
all
about
it
all
seemed
to
make
no
difference
to
me
when
i
sat
down
before
pieces
of
blank
paper
to
get
down
some
kind
of
picture
some
kind
of
impression
of
a
long
day
in
place
where
i
had
been
scared
awhile
because
death
was
on
the
prowl
in
a
noisy
way
and
i
had
seen
it
pounce
on
human
bodies
i
knew
that
tomorrow
i
was
going
to
another
little
of
war
where
i
should
hear
the
same
noises
that
talk
downstairs
that
worry
about
some
mystery
at
would
make
no
difference
to
the
life
or
death
of
men
nor
get
rid
of
that
coldness
which
came
to
me
when
men
were
being
killed
nearby
why
all
that
argument
it
seemed
that
h
mysterious
people
in
a
mysterious
place
were
drawing
up
rules
for
war
correspondence
and
censorship
altering
rules
made
the
day
before
formulating
new
rules
for
establishing
precedents
writing
minutes
initialing
reports
with
passed
to
you
or
i
agree
written
on
the
margin
the
censors
who
lived
with
us
and
traveled
with
us
and
were
our
friends
and
read
what
we
wrote
before
the
ink
was
dry
had
to
examine
our
screeds
with
microscopic
eyes
and
with
infinite
remembrance
of
the
thousand
and
one
rules
was
it
safe
to
mention
the
weather
would
that
give
any
information
to
the
enemy
was
it
permissible
to
describe
the
smell
of
in
the
trenches
or
would
that
discourage
recruiting
that
description
of
the
traffic
on
the
roads
of
war
with
transport
wagons
lorries
mules
how
did
that
conflict
with
rule
no
or
whatever
it
was
prohibiting
all
mention
of
movements
of
troops
one
of
the
censors
working
late
at
night
with
lines
of
worry
on
his
forehead
and
little
puckers
about
his
eyes
turned
to
me
with
a
queer
laugh
one
night
in
the
early
days
he
was
an
indian
civil
servant
and
therefore
by
every
rule
a
gentleman
and
a
charming
fellow
you
do
know
what
i
am
risking
in
passing
your
despatch
it
too
good
to
spoil
but
will
probably
find
that
it
conveys
accurate
information
to
the
enemy
about
the
offensive
in
i
shall
get
the
sack
and
oh
the
difference
to
me
it
appeared
that
was
nervous
of
us
they
suggested
that
our
private
letters
should
be
tested
for
writing
in
invisible
ink
between
the
lines
they
were
afraid
that
either
deliberately
for
some
journalistic
advantage
or
in
sheer
ignorance
as
outsiders
we
might
hand
information
to
the
enemy
about
important
secrets
belonging
to
the
old
caste
of
army
mind
they
believed
that
war
was
the
special
prerogative
of
professional
soldiers
of
which
politicians
and
people
should
have
no
knowledge
therefore
as
civilians
in
khaki
we
were
hardly
better
than
spies
the
indian
civil
servant
went
for
a
stroll
with
me
in
the
moonlight
after
a
day
up
the
line
where
young
men
were
living
and
dying
in
dirty
ditches
i
could
see
that
he
was
worried
even
angry
those
people
he
said
what
people
g
oh
lord
i
groaned
again
and
looked
across
the
fields
of
corn
to
the
dark
outline
of
a
convent
on
the
hill
where
young
officers
were
learning
the
gentle
art
of
killing
by
before
their
turn
came
to
be
killed
or
crippled
i
thought
of
a
dead
boy
i
had
seen
that
day
or
yesterday
was
it
kneeling
on
the
of
a
trench
with
his
forehead
against
the
parapet
as
though
in
prayer
how
sweet
was
the
scent
of
the
clover
and
how
that
star
twinkled
above
the
low
flashes
of
away
there
in
the
salient
they
want
us
to
waste
your
time
said
the
officer
those
were
the
very
words
used
by
the
chief
of
intelligence
in
writing
which
i
have
kept
their
time
i
be
damned
if
i
consider
my
work
is
to
waste
the
time
of
war
correspondents
do
those
good
fools
see
that
this
is
not
a
professional
adventure
like
their
other
little
wars
that
the
whole
nation
is
in
it
and
that
the
nation
demands
to
know
what
its
men
are
doing
they
have
a
right
to
iv
just
at
first
though
not
for
long
there
was
a
touch
of
hostility
against
us
among
divisional
and
brigade
staffs
of
the
regulars
but
not
of
the
new
army
they
too
suspected
our
motive
in
going
to
their
quarters
wondered
why
we
should
come
spying
around
trying
to
see
i
was
faintly
conscious
of
this
one
day
in
those
very
early
times
when
with
the
officer
who
had
been
a
ruler
in
india
i
went
to
a
brigade
headquarters
of
the
division
near
vermelles
it
was
not
easy
nor
pleasant
to
get
there
though
it
was
a
summer
day
with
fleecy
clouds
in
a
blue
sky
there
was
a
long
straight
road
leading
to
the
village
of
vermelles
with
a
crisscross
of
communication
trenches
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
fields
where
corn
and
grass
grew
rankly
in
abandoned
fields
some
lean
sheep
were
browsing
there
as
though
this
were
arcady
in
days
of
peace
it
was
not
the
red
ruins
of
vermelles
a
mile
or
so
away
were
sharply
defined
as
through
stereoscopic
lenses
in
the
quiver
of
sunlight
and
had
the
sinister
look
of
a
place
it
was
where
the
french
had
fought
their
way
through
gardens
walls
and
houses
in
murderous
battle
before
leaving
it
for
british
troops
to
hold
across
it
now
came
the
whine
of
shells
and
i
saw
that
shrapnel
bullets
were
kicking
up
the
dust
of
a
thousand
yards
down
the
straight
road
following
a
small
body
of
brown
men
whose
tramp
of
feet
raised
another
cloud
of
dust
like
smoke
they
were
the
only
representatives
of
human
life
besides
ourselves
in
this
loneliness
though
many
men
must
have
been
in
hiding
somewhere
then
heavy
crumps
burst
in
the
fields
where
the
sheep
were
browsing
across
the
way
we
had
to
go
to
the
brigade
headquarters
how
about
it
asked
the
captain
with
me
i
do
like
crossing
that
field
in
spite
of
the
buttercups
and
daisies
and
the
little
frisky
i
hate
the
idea
of
it
i
said
then
we
looked
down
the
road
at
the
little
body
of
brown
men
they
were
nearer
now
and
i
could
see
the
face
of
the
officer
leading
them
a
boy
subaltern
rather
pale
though
the
sun
was
hot
he
halted
and
saluted
my
companion
the
enemy
seems
to
have
sighted
our
dust
sir
his
shrapnel
is
following
up
pretty
closely
would
you
advise
me
to
put
my
men
under
cover
or
carry
on
the
captain
hesitated
this
was
rather
outside
his
sphere
of
influence
but
the
boyishness
of
the
other
officer
asked
for
help
my
advice
is
to
put
your
men
into
that
ditch
and
keep
them
there
until
the
strafe
is
some
shrapnel
bullets
whipped
the
road
as
he
spoke
very
good
the
men
sat
in
the
ditch
with
their
packs
against
the
bank
and
wiped
the
sweat
off
their
faces
they
looked
tired
and
dispirited
but
not
alarmed
in
the
fields
behind
them
our
way
the
four
were
busy
plugging
holes
in
the
grass
and
flowers
rather
deep
holes
from
which
white
rose
after
explosive
noises
with
a
little
careful
strategy
we
might
get
through
said
the
captain
there
a
general
waiting
for
us
and
i
have
noticed
that
generals
are
impatient
fellows
let
try
our
we
walked
across
the
wild
flowers
past
the
sheep
who
only
raised
their
heads
in
meek
surprise
when
shells
came
with
a
shrill
intensifying
snarl
and
burrowed
up
the
earth
about
them
i
noticed
how
loudly
and
sweetly
the
larks
were
singing
up
in
the
blue
several
horses
lay
dead
newly
killed
with
blood
oozing
about
them
and
their
entrails
smoking
we
made
a
around
them
and
then
struck
straight
for
the
chateau
which
was
the
brigade
headquarters
neither
of
us
spoke
now
we
were
thoughtful
calculating
the
chance
of
getting
to
that
house
between
the
shells
it
was
just
dependent
on
the
coincidence
of
time
and
place
three
men
jumped
up
from
a
ditch
below
a
brown
wall
round
the
chateau
garden
and
ran
hard
for
the
gateway
a
shell
had
pitched
quite
close
to
them
one
man
laughed
as
though
at
a
grotesque
joke
and
fell
as
he
reached
the
courtyard
smoke
was
rising
from
the
outhouses
and
there
was
a
clatter
of
tiles
and
timbers
after
an
explosive
crash
it
rather
looks
said
my
companion
as
though
the
germans
knew
there
is
a
party
on
in
that
charming
it
was
as
good
to
go
on
as
to
go
back
and
it
was
never
good
to
go
back
before
reaching
one
objective
that
was
bad
for
the
discipline
of
the
courage
that
is
just
beyond
fear
two
gunners
were
killed
in
the
back
yard
of
the
chateau
and
as
we
went
in
through
the
gateway
a
sergeant
made
a
quick
jump
for
a
barn
as
a
shell
burst
somewhere
close
as
visitors
we
hesitated
between
two
ways
into
the
chateau
and
chose
the
easier
and
it
was
then
that
i
became
dimly
aware
of
hostility
against
me
on
the
part
of
a
number
of
officers
in
the
front
hall
the
brigade
staff
was
there
grouped
under
the
banisters
i
wondered
why
and
guessed
rightly
as
i
found
that
the
center
of
the
house
might
have
a
better
chance
of
escape
than
the
rooms
on
either
side
in
case
of
direct
hits
from
those
things
falling
outside
it
was
the
brigade
major
who
asked
our
business
he
was
a
tall
handsome
young
man
of
something
over
thirty
with
the
arrogance
of
a
christ
church
blood
oh
he
has
come
out
to
see
something
in
vermelles
a
pleasant
place
for
sightseeing
meanwhile
the
hun
is
ranging
on
this
house
so
he
may
see
more
than
he
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
rejoined
his
group
they
all
stared
in
my
direction
as
though
at
a
curious
animal
a
very
young
gentleman
the
general
made
a
funny
remark
at
my
expense
and
the
others
laughed
then
they
ignored
me
and
i
was
glad
and
made
a
little
study
in
the
psychology
of
men
awaiting
a
close
call
of
death
i
was
perfectly
conscious
myself
that
in
a
moment
or
two
some
of
us
perhaps
all
of
us
might
be
in
a
pulp
of
mangled
flesh
beneath
the
ruins
of
a
villa
the
shells
were
crashing
among
the
outhouses
and
in
the
courtyard
and
the
enemy
was
making
good
shooting
and
the
idea
did
not
please
me
at
all
at
the
back
of
my
brain
was
fear
and
there
was
a
cold
sweat
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
but
i
was
master
of
myself
and
i
remember
having
a
sense
of
satisfaction
because
i
had
answered
the
brigade
major
in
a
level
voice
with
a
touch
of
his
own
arrogance
i
saw
that
these
officers
were
afraid
that
they
too
had
fear
at
the
back
of
the
brain
and
that
their
conversation
and
laughter
were
the
camouflage
of
the
soul
the
face
of
the
young
was
flushed
and
he
laughed
too
much
at
his
own
jokes
and
his
laughter
was
just
a
tone
too
shrill
an
officer
came
into
the
hall
carrying
two
mills
bombs
new
toys
in
those
days
and
the
others
fell
back
from
him
and
one
said
for
christ
sake
do
bring
them
here
in
the
middle
of
a
bombardment
where
the
general
asked
the
newcomer
down
in
the
cellar
with
the
other
brigadier
they
do
ask
us
down
to
tea
i
those
last
words
caused
all
the
officers
to
laugh
almost
excessively
but
their
laughter
ended
sharply
and
they
listened
intently
as
there
was
a
heavy
crash
outside
another
officer
came
up
the
steps
and
made
a
rapid
entry
into
the
hall
i
understand
there
is
to
be
a
conference
of
battalion
commanders
he
said
with
a
queer
catch
in
his
breath
in
view
of
this
er
bombardment
i
had
better
come
in
later
perhaps
you
had
better
wait
said
the
brigade
major
rather
grimly
oh
a
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
passage
by
the
back
door
he
was
calm
and
stolid
i
liked
the
look
of
him
and
found
something
comforting
in
his
presence
so
that
i
went
to
have
a
few
words
with
him
how
long
is
this
likely
to
last
there
no
saying
sir
they
may
be
searching
for
the
chateau
to
pass
the
time
so
to
speak
or
they
may
go
on
till
they
get
it
i
sorry
they
caught
those
gunners
nice
lads
both
of
he
did
not
seem
to
be
worrying
about
his
own
chance
then
suddenly
there
was
silence
the
german
guns
had
switched
off
i
heard
the
larks
singing
through
the
open
doorway
and
all
the
little
sounds
of
a
summer
day
the
group
of
officers
in
the
hall
started
chatting
more
quietly
there
was
no
more
need
of
finding
jokes
and
laughter
they
had
been
reprieved
and
could
be
serious
we
better
get
forward
to
vermelles
said
my
companion
as
we
walked
away
from
the
chateau
the
brigade
major
passed
us
on
his
horse
he
leaned
over
his
saddle
toward
me
and
said
good
day
to
you
and
i
hope
you
like
the
words
were
civil
but
there
was
an
underlying
meaning
in
them
i
hope
to
do
so
we
walked
down
the
long
straight
road
toward
the
ruins
of
vermelles
with
a
young
who
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
remarked
in
a
casual
way
no
one
is
allowed
along
this
road
in
daylight
as
a
rule
it
under
hobservation
of
the
then
why
the
devil
did
you
come
this
way
asked
my
companion
i
thought
you
might
prefer
the
short
cut
we
explored
the
ruins
of
vermelles
where
many
young
frenchmen
had
fallen
in
fighting
through
the
walls
and
gardens
one
could
see
the
track
of
their
strife
in
trampled
bushes
and
broken
walls
bits
of
red
rag
the
red
pantaloons
of
the
first
french
soldiers
were
still
fastened
to
brambles
and
barbed
wire
broken
rifles
cartouches
torn
letters
twisted
bayonets
and
german
littered
the
ditches
which
had
been
dug
as
trenches
across
streets
of
houses
v
a
young
gunner
officer
whom
we
met
was
very
civil
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
chateau
of
vermelles
a
big
red
villa
with
the
outer
walls
still
standing
and
told
us
the
story
of
its
capture
it
was
a
wild
scrap
i
was
told
all
about
it
by
a
french
sergeant
who
was
in
it
they
were
under
the
cover
of
that
wall
over
there
about
a
hundred
yards
away
and
fixing
up
a
charge
of
high
explosives
to
knock
a
breach
in
the
wall
the
chateau
was
a
fortress
with
the
germans
on
the
top
floor
the
ground
floor
and
in
the
basement
protected
by
through
which
they
fired
a
german
officer
made
a
bad
mistake
he
opened
the
front
door
and
came
out
with
some
of
his
from
the
ground
floor
to
hold
a
trench
across
the
square
in
front
of
the
house
instantly
a
french
lieutenant
called
to
his
men
they
climbed
over
the
wall
and
made
a
dash
for
the
chateau
bayoneting
the
germans
who
tried
to
stop
them
then
they
swarmed
into
the
chateau
a
platoon
of
them
with
the
lieutenant
they
were
in
the
quite
an
elegant
place
you
know
with
the
usual
gilt
furniture
and
long
mirrors
in
one
corner
was
a
pedestal
with
a
statue
of
venus
standing
on
it
rather
charming
i
expect
a
few
germans
were
killed
in
the
room
easily
but
upstairs
there
was
a
mob
who
fired
down
through
the
ceiling
when
they
found
what
had
happened
the
french
soldiers
prodded
the
ceiling
with
their
bayonets
and
all
the
plaster
broke
falling
on
them
a
german
fat
and
heavy
fell
through
the
rafters
and
a
bayonet
was
poked
into
him
as
he
stuck
there
the
whole
ceiling
gave
way
and
the
germans
upstairs
came
downstairs
in
a
heap
they
fought
like
wolves
wild
beasts
with
fear
and
rage
french
and
germans
clawed
at
one
another
throats
grabbed
hold
of
noses
rolled
over
each
other
the
french
sergeant
told
me
he
had
his
teeth
into
a
german
neck
the
man
was
all
over
him
pinning
his
arms
trying
to
choke
him
it
was
the
french
lieutenant
who
did
most
damage
he
fired
his
last
shot
and
smashed
a
german
face
with
his
empty
revolver
then
he
caught
hold
of
the
marble
venus
by
the
legs
and
swung
it
above
his
head
in
the
old
berserker
style
and
laid
out
germans
like
ninepins
the
fellows
in
the
basement
vi
the
chateau
of
vermelles
where
that
had
happened
was
an
empty
ruin
and
there
was
no
sign
of
the
gilt
furniture
or
the
long
mirrors
or
the
marble
venus
when
i
looked
through
the
charred
upon
piles
of
bricks
and
timber
churned
up
by
the
gunner
officer
took
us
to
the
cemetery
to
meet
some
friends
of
his
who
had
their
battery
nearby
we
stumbled
over
broken
walls
and
pushed
through
undergrowth
to
get
to
the
graveyard
where
some
broken
crosses
and
wire
frames
with
immortelles
remained
as
relics
of
that
garden
where
the
people
of
vermelles
had
laid
their
dead
to
rest
new
dead
had
followed
old
dead
i
stumbled
over
something
soft
like
a
ball
of
clay
and
saw
that
it
was
the
head
of
a
faceless
man
in
a
battered
kepi
from
a
ditch
close
by
came
a
sickly
stench
of
flesh
the
whole
place
is
a
said
the
gunner
another
voice
spoke
from
some
salvo
the
earth
shook
and
there
was
a
flash
of
red
flame
and
a
shock
of
noise
which
hurt
one
that
my
battery
said
the
gunner
officer
it
the
very
devil
when
one
does
expect
i
was
introduced
to
the
gentleman
who
had
said
salvo
he
was
the
and
a
charming
fellow
recently
from
civil
life
all
the
battery
was
made
up
of
new
army
men
learning
their
job
and
learning
it
very
well
i
should
say
there
was
no
arrogance
about
them
it
sporting
of
you
to
come
along
to
a
spot
like
this
said
one
of
them
i
would
unless
i
had
to
of
course
you
take
tea
in
our
mess
i
was
glad
to
take
tea
in
a
little
house
at
the
end
of
the
ruined
of
vermelles
which
had
by
some
miracle
escaped
destruction
though
a
shell
had
pierced
through
the
brick
wall
of
the
parlor
and
had
failed
to
burst
it
was
there
still
firmly
wedged
like
a
huge
nail
the
tea
was
good
in
tin
mugs
better
still
was
the
company
of
the
gunner
officers
they
told
me
how
often
they
were
scared
they
had
been
very
frightened
an
hour
before
i
came
when
the
german
gunners
had
ranged
up
and
down
the
street
smashing
up
ruined
houses
into
greater
ruin
they
so
methodical
said
one
of
the
officers
wonderful
shooting
said
another
i
will
say
they
topping
gunners
said
the
major
but
learning
my
men
are
very
keen
put
in
a
good
word
for
the
new
artillery
it
would
buck
them
up
no
we
went
back
before
sunset
down
the
long
straight
road
and
past
the
chateau
which
we
had
visited
in
the
afternoon
it
looked
very
peaceful
there
among
the
trees
it
is
curious
that
i
remember
the
details
of
that
day
so
vividly
as
though
they
happened
yesterday
on
hundreds
of
other
days
i
had
adventures
like
that
which
i
remember
more
dimly
that
brigade
major
was
a
trifle
haughty
do
you
think
said
my
companion
and
the
others
did
seem
very
friendly
not
like
those
gunner
we
called
at
an
awkward
time
they
were
rather
one
expects
good
manners
especially
from
regulars
who
pride
themselves
on
being
different
in
that
way
from
the
new
it
the
difference
between
the
professional
and
the
amateur
soldier
the
regular
crowd
think
the
war
belongs
to
them
but
i
liked
their
pluck
they
arrogant
to
death
himself
when
he
comes
knocking
at
the
vii
it
was
not
long
before
we
broke
down
the
prejudice
against
us
among
the
fighting
units
the
new
armies
were
our
friends
from
the
first
and
liked
us
to
visit
them
in
their
trenches
and
their
dugouts
their
camps
and
their
billets
every
young
officer
was
keen
to
show
us
his
particular
or
to
tell
us
his
latest
we
made
many
friends
among
them
and
it
was
our
grief
that
as
the
war
went
on
so
many
of
them
disappeared
from
their
battalions
and
old
faces
were
replaced
by
new
faces
and
those
again
by
others
when
they
had
become
familiar
again
and
again
after
battle
officers
in
a
battalion
mess
were
reduced
to
two
or
three
and
the
gaps
were
filled
up
from
the
reserve
depots
i
was
afraid
to
ask
where
is
because
i
knew
that
the
best
answer
would
be
a
blighty
wound
and
the
worst
was
more
likely
it
was
the
duration
of
all
the
drama
of
death
that
seared
one
soul
as
an
onlooker
the
frightful
sum
of
sacrifice
that
we
were
recording
day
by
day
there
were
times
when
it
became
intolerable
and
agonizing
and
when
i
at
least
desired
peace
by
negotiation
by
compromise
that
the
river
of
blood
might
cease
to
flow
the
men
looked
so
splendid
as
they
marched
up
to
the
lines
singing
whistling
with
an
easy
swing
they
looked
so
different
when
thousands
came
down
again
to
field
the
walking
wounded
and
the
stretcher
cases
the
blind
and
the
gassed
as
we
saw
them
on
the
mornings
of
battle
month
after
month
year
after
year
our
work
as
chroniclers
of
their
acts
was
not
altogether
soft
though
we
did
not
go
over
the
top
or
live
in
the
dirty
ditches
with
them
we
had
to
travel
prodigiously
to
cover
the
ground
between
one
division
and
another
along
a
hundred
miles
of
front
with
long
walks
often
at
the
journey
end
and
a
wet
way
back
sometimes
we
were
soaked
to
the
skin
on
the
journey
home
often
we
were
so
cold
and
numbed
in
those
long
wild
drives
up
desolate
roads
that
our
limbs
lost
consciousness
and
the
wind
cut
into
us
like
knives
we
were
working
against
time
always
against
time
and
another
would
mean
that
no
despatch
could
be
written
of
a
great
battle
on
the
british
front
or
only
a
short
record
written
in
the
wildest
haste
when
there
was
so
much
to
tell
so
much
to
describe
such
unforgetable
pictures
in
one
brain
of
another
impressions
in
the
fields
and
on
the
roads
there
were
five
english
correspondents
and
two
years
later
two
americans
on
mornings
of
big
battle
we
divided
up
the
line
of
front
and
drew
lots
for
the
particular
section
which
each
man
would
cover
then
before
the
dawn
or
in
the
murk
of
winter
mornings
or
the
first
glimmer
of
a
summer
day
our
cars
would
pull
out
and
we
would
go
off
separately
to
the
part
of
the
line
allotted
to
us
by
the
number
drawn
to
see
the
preliminary
bombardment
to
walk
over
newly
captured
ground
to
get
into
the
backwash
of
prisoners
and
walking
wounded
amid
batteries
firing
a
new
barrage
guns
moving
forward
on
days
of
good
advance
artillery
transport
bringing
up
new
stores
of
ammunition
troops
in
support
marching
to
repel
a
or
follow
through
the
new
objectives
ambulances
threading
their
way
back
through
the
traffic
with
loads
of
prostrate
men
mules
gunhorses
lorries
churning
up
the
mud
in
flanders
so
we
gained
a
personal
view
of
all
this
activity
of
strife
and
from
many
men
in
its
whirlpool
details
of
their
own
adventure
and
of
general
progress
or
disaster
on
one
sector
of
the
then
in
divisional
headquarters
we
saw
the
reports
of
the
battle
as
they
came
in
by
telephone
or
aircraft
or
from
to
or
ten
minutes
by
ten
minutes
three
divisions
widely
separated
provided
all
the
work
one
war
correspondent
could
do
on
one
day
of
action
and
later
news
on
a
broader
scale
could
be
obtained
from
corps
headquarters
farther
back
tired
hungry
splashed
to
the
eyes
in
mud
or
covered
in
a
mask
of
dust
we
started
for
the
journey
back
to
our
own
quarters
which
we
shifted
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
get
as
near
as
we
could
to
the
latest
without
getting
beyond
reach
of
the
telegraph
instruments
by
relays
of
at
signals
which
remained
immovably
fixed
in
the
rear
there
was
a
rendezvous
in
one
of
our
rooms
and
each
man
outlined
the
historical
narrative
of
the
day
upon
the
front
he
had
covered
reserving
for
himself
his
own
adventures
impressions
and
emotions
time
slipped
away
and
time
was
short
while
the
waited
for
our
unwritten
despatches
and
censors
who
had
been
our
washed
themselves
cleaner
and
kept
an
eye
on
the
clock
time
was
short
while
the
world
waited
for
our
tales
of
tragedy
or
victory
and
tempers
were
frayed
and
nerves
on
edge
among
five
men
who
hated
one
another
sometimes
with
a
murderous
hatred
though
otherwise
good
comrades
and
desired
one
another
death
by
slow
torture
or
when
they
fumbled
over
notes
written
in
a
jolting
car
or
on
a
battlefield
walk
and
went
into
past
history
in
order
to
explain
present
happenings
or
became
tangled
in
the
numbers
of
battalions
and
divisions
percival
phillips
turned
under
the
hideous
strain
of
nervous
control
with
an
hour
and
a
half
for
two
columns
in
the
morning
post
a
little
pulse
throbbed
in
his
forehead
his
lips
were
tightly
pressed
his
oaths
and
his
anguish
were
in
his
soul
but
unuttered
beach
thomas
the
most
amiable
of
men
the
peter
pan
who
went
a
on
battlefields
a
lover
of
beauty
and
games
and
old
poems
and
greek
and
latin
tags
and
all
joy
in
life
what
had
he
to
do
with
war
looked
bored
with
an
infinite
boredom
irritable
with
a
scornful
impatience
of
unnecessary
detail
gazed
through
his
spectacles
with
an
air
of
extreme
detachment
when
percy
robinson
rebuilt
the
map
with
dabs
and
dashes
on
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
said
i
got
more
than
i
can
write
and
the
daily
mail
goes
early
to
thanks
very
much
it
very
kind
of
we
gathered
up
our
and
were
punctiliously
polite
afterward
we
were
the
best
of
friends
thomas
was
first
out
of
the
room
with
short
quick
little
steps
in
spite
of
his
long
legs
his
door
banged
phillips
was
first
at
his
typewriter
working
it
like
a
in
short
furious
spasms
of
i
sat
down
to
my
typewriter
a
new
instrument
of
torture
to
me
and
coaxed
its
evil
genius
with
conciliatory
prayers
for
dear
god
sake
i
said
do
go
twisting
that
blasted
ribbon
of
yours
i
must
write
this
despatch
and
i
just
an
hour
when
i
want
sometimes
that
corona
was
a
mechanism
of
singular
sweetness
and
i
blessed
it
with
a
benediction
but
often
there
was
a
devil
in
it
which
mocked
at
me
after
the
first
sentence
or
two
it
twisted
the
ribbon
at
the
end
of
twenty
sentences
the
ribbon
was
like
an
angry
snake
writhing
and
coiling
hideously
i
shouted
for
mackenzie
the
american
a
master
of
these
things
he
came
in
and
saw
my
blanched
face
my
sweat
of
anguish
my
crise
de
nerfs
i
could
see
by
his
eyes
that
he
understood
my
stress
and
had
pity
on
me
that
all
right
he
said
a
little
patience
by
a
touch
or
two
he
exorcised
the
devil
laughed
and
said
go
easy
you
just
about
reached
breaking
i
wrote
as
we
all
wrote
fast
and
furiously
to
get
down
something
of
enormous
history
of
things
seen
heroic
anecdotes
the
underlying
meaning
of
this
new
slaughter
there
was
never
time
to
think
out
a
sentence
or
a
phrase
to
touch
up
a
clumsy
paragraph
to
go
back
on
a
false
start
to
annihilate
a
vulgar
adjective
to
put
a
touch
of
style
into
one
narrative
one
wrote
instinctively
blindly
feverishly
and
downstairs
were
the
censors
sending
up
messages
by
orderlies
to
say
or
ten
minutes
more
and
cutting
out
sometimes
the
things
one
wanted
most
to
say
modifying
a
direct
statement
of
fact
into
a
vague
surmise
taking
away
the
honor
due
to
the
heroic
men
who
had
fought
and
died
who
would
be
a
war
correspondent
or
a
censor
so
it
happened
day
by
day
for
five
months
at
a
stretch
when
big
battles
were
in
progress
it
was
not
an
easy
life
there
were
times
when
i
was
so
physically
and
mentally
exhausted
that
i
could
hardly
rouse
myself
to
a
new
day
effort
there
were
times
when
i
was
faint
and
sick
and
weak
and
my
colleagues
were
like
me
but
we
struggled
on
to
tell
the
daily
history
of
the
war
and
the
public
cursed
us
because
we
did
not
tell
more
or
sneered
at
us
because
they
thought
we
were
by
h
who
never
gave
us
any
news
and
who
were
far
from
our
way
of
life
except
when
they
thwarted
us
by
petty
restrictions
and
foolish
rules
viii
the
sir
john
french
received
us
when
we
were
first
attached
to
the
british
armies
in
the
field
a
lifetime
ago
as
it
seems
to
me
now
it
was
a
formal
ceremony
in
the
chateau
near
which
he
used
as
his
own
headquarters
with
his
in
attendance
though
the
main
general
headquarters
were
in
the
town
our
first
colonel
gathered
us
like
a
shepherd
with
his
flock
counting
us
twice
over
before
we
passed
in
a
tall
dark
young
man
whom
i
knew
afterward
to
be
sir
philip
sassoon
received
us
and
chatted
pleasantly
in
a
french
salon
with
which
shut
off
an
inner
room
there
were
a
few
portraits
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
france
in
the
days
before
the
revolution
like
those
belonging
to
that
old
aristocracy
which
still
existed
in
poverty
and
pride
in
other
chateaus
in
this
french
flanders
there
was
a
bouquet
of
flowers
on
the
table
giving
a
sweet
scent
to
the
room
and
sunlight
streamed
through
the
shutters
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
the
men
living
in
ditches
in
the
salient
under
harassing
fire
by
day
and
night
their
actions
and
their
encounters
with
death
were
being
arranged
without
their
knowledge
in
this
sunny
little
chateau
the
opened
and
sir
john
french
came
in
he
wore
and
spurs
and
after
saying
good
day
gentlemen
stood
with
his
legs
apart
a
stocky
soldierly
figure
with
a
square
head
and
heavy
jaw
i
wondered
whether
there
were
any
light
of
genius
in
him
any
inspiration
any
force
which
would
break
the
awful
strength
of
the
enemy
against
us
any
cunning
in
modern
warfare
he
coughed
a
little
and
made
us
a
speech
i
forget
his
words
but
remember
the
gist
of
them
he
was
pleased
to
welcome
us
within
his
army
and
trusted
to
our
honor
and
loyalty
he
made
an
allusion
to
the
power
of
the
press
and
promised
us
facilities
for
seeing
and
writing
within
the
bounds
of
censorship
i
noticed
that
he
pronounced
as
though
omar
khayyam
had
been
canonized
he
said
good
day
gentlemen
again
and
coughed
huskily
again
to
clear
his
throat
and
then
went
back
through
the
i
saw
him
later
during
the
battle
of
loos
after
its
ghastly
failure
he
was
riding
a
white
horse
in
the
villages
of
heuchin
and
houdain
through
which
lightly
wounded
scots
of
the
and
divisions
were
making
their
way
back
he
leaned
over
his
saddle
questioning
the
men
and
thanking
them
for
their
gallantry
i
thought
he
looked
grayer
and
older
than
when
he
had
addressed
us
who
mun
that
old
geezer
be
jock
asked
a
highlander
when
he
had
passed
i
dinna
ken
said
the
other
scot
an
i
dinna
it
the
i
said
sir
john
eh
said
the
younger
man
of
the
gordons
he
did
not
seem
thrilled
by
the
knowledge
i
had
given
him
but
turned
his
head
and
stared
after
the
figure
on
the
white
horse
then
he
said
well
he
made
a
mess
the
battle
we
could
held
hill
against
all
the
o
hell
if
there
had
bin
supports
behind
ay
said
his
comrade
an
there
few
o
the
laddies
come
back
fra
cite
ix
it
was
another
who
received
us
some
months
after
the
battle
of
loos
in
a
chateau
near
montreuil
to
which
had
then
removed
our
only
knowledge
of
sir
douglas
haig
before
that
day
was
of
a
hostile
influence
against
us
in
the
first
army
which
he
commanded
he
had
drawn
a
line
through
his
area
beyond
which
we
might
not
pass
he
did
not
desire
our
presence
among
his
troops
nor
in
his
neighborhood
that
line
had
been
broken
by
the
protests
of
our
commandant
and
now
as
sir
douglas
haig
had
realized
dimly
that
he
might
be
helped
by
our
services
it
was
in
another
french
salon
that
we
waited
for
the
man
who
controlled
the
british
armies
in
the
field
those
armies
which
we
now
knew
in
some
intimacy
whom
we
had
seen
in
the
trenches
and
and
billets
hearing
their
point
of
view
knowing
their
suffering
and
their
patience
and
their
impatience
and
their
deadly
hatred
of
q
he
was
very
handsome
as
he
sat
behind
a
louis
xiv
table
with
general
charteris
his
chief
of
intelligence
who
was
our
chief
too
behind
him
at
one
side
for
prompting
and
advice
he
received
us
with
fine
courtesy
and
said
pray
be
seated
there
had
been
many
troubles
over
censorship
of
which
he
knew
but
vaguely
through
general
charteris
who
looked
upon
us
as
his
special
we
had
fought
hard
for
liberty
in
mentioning
units
to
give
the
honor
to
the
troops
and
for
other
concessions
which
would
free
our
pens
the
was
sympathetic
but
his
sympathy
was
expressed
in
words
which
revealed
a
complete
misunderstanding
of
our
purpose
and
of
our
work
and
was
indeed
no
less
than
an
insult
unconscious
but
very
hurtful
i
think
i
understand
fairly
well
what
you
gentlemen
want
he
said
you
want
to
get
hold
of
little
stories
of
heroism
and
so
forth
and
to
write
them
up
in
a
bright
way
to
make
good
reading
for
mary
ann
in
the
kitchen
and
the
man
in
the
the
quiet
passion
with
which
those
words
were
resented
by
us
the
quick
repudiation
of
this
slur
upon
our
purpose
by
a
charming
man
perfectly
ignorant
at
that
time
of
the
new
psychology
of
nations
in
a
war
which
was
no
longer
a
professional
adventure
surprised
him
we
took
occasion
to
point
out
to
him
that
the
british
empire
which
had
sent
its
men
into
this
war
yearned
to
know
what
they
were
doing
and
how
they
were
doing
and
that
their
patience
and
loyalty
depended
upon
closer
knowledge
of
what
was
happening
than
was
told
them
in
the
communiques
issued
by
the
himself
we
urged
him
to
let
us
mention
more
frequently
the
names
of
the
troops
engaged
especially
english
troops
for
the
sake
of
the
soldiers
themselves
who
were
discouraged
by
this
lack
of
recognition
and
for
the
sake
of
the
people
behind
them
it
was
to
the
pressure
of
the
war
correspondents
very
largely
that
the
troops
owed
the
mention
and
honor
which
came
to
them
more
generously
in
the
later
phases
of
the
war
the
made
a
note
of
our
grievances
turning
now
and
again
to
general
charteris
who
was
extremely
nervous
at
our
frankness
of
speech
and
telling
him
to
relax
the
rules
of
censorship
as
far
as
possible
that
was
done
and
in
later
stages
of
the
war
i
personally
had
no
great
complaint
against
the
censorship
and
wrote
all
that
was
possible
to
write
of
the
actions
day
by
day
though
i
had
to
leave
out
something
of
the
underlying
horror
of
them
all
in
spite
of
my
continual
emphasis
by
temperament
and
by
conviction
on
the
tragedy
of
all
this
sacrifice
of
youth
the
only
alternative
to
what
we
wrote
would
have
been
a
passionate
denunciation
of
all
this
ghastly
slaughter
and
violent
attacks
on
british
generalship
even
now
i
do
not
think
that
would
have
been
justified
as
bernard
shaw
told
me
while
the
war
lasts
one
must
put
one
own
soul
under
after
many
bloody
battles
had
been
fought
we
were
received
again
by
the
and
this
time
his
cordiality
was
not
marred
by
any
slighting
touch
gentlemen
he
said
you
have
played
the
game
like
men
when
victory
came
at
last
at
last
after
the
years
of
slaughter
it
was
the
little
band
of
war
correspondents
on
the
british
front
our
foreign
comrades
included
whom
the
addressed
on
his
first
visit
to
the
rhine
we
stood
on
the
hohenzollern
bridge
in
cologne
watched
by
groups
of
germans
peering
through
the
escort
of
lancers
it
was
a
dank
and
foul
day
but
to
us
beautiful
because
this
was
the
end
of
the
long
journey
years
long
which
had
been
filled
with
slaughter
all
the
way
so
that
we
were
tired
of
its
backwash
of
agony
which
had
overwhelmed
our
souls
mine
certainly
the
read
out
a
speech
to
us
thanking
us
for
our
services
which
he
said
had
helped
him
to
victory
because
we
had
heartened
the
troops
and
the
people
by
our
work
it
was
a
recognition
by
the
leader
of
our
armies
that
as
chroniclers
of
war
we
had
been
a
spiritual
force
behind
his
arms
it
was
a
reward
for
many
mournful
days
for
much
agony
of
spirit
for
hours
of
danger
some
of
us
had
walked
often
in
the
ways
of
death
and
for
exhausting
labors
which
we
did
so
that
the
world
might
know
what
british
soldiers
had
been
doing
and
suffering
x
i
came
to
know
general
headquarters
more
closely
when
it
removed
for
fresher
air
to
montreuil
a
fine
old
walled
town
once
within
sight
of
the
sea
which
ebbed
over
the
ground
below
its
hill
but
now
looking
across
a
wide
vista
of
richly
cultivated
fields
where
many
hamlets
are
scattered
among
clumps
of
trees
one
came
to
from
journeys
over
the
wild
desert
of
the
battlefields
where
men
lived
in
ditches
and
muddy
miserable
in
all
things
but
spirit
as
to
a
place
where
the
pageantry
of
war
still
maintained
its
old
and
dead
tradition
it
was
like
one
of
those
pageants
which
used
to
be
played
in
england
before
the
war
picturesque
romantic
utterly
unreal
it
was
as
though
men
were
playing
at
war
here
while
others
sixty
miles
away
were
fighting
and
dying
in
mud
and
and
explosive
barrages
an
open
sesame
by
means
of
a
special
pass
was
needed
to
enter
this
city
of
beautiful
nonsense
below
the
gateway
up
the
steep
hillside
sentries
stood
at
a
white
post
across
the
road
which
lifted
up
on
pulleys
when
the
pass
had
been
examined
by
a
military
policeman
in
a
red
cap
then
the
sentries
slapped
their
hands
on
their
rifles
to
the
occupants
of
any
sure
that
more
were
going
in
to
perform
those
duties
which
no
private
soldier
could
attempt
to
understand
believing
they
belonged
to
such
mysteries
as
those
of
god
through
the
narrow
streets
walked
elderly
generals
colonels
and
majors
youthful
subalterns
all
wearing
red
red
tabs
and
the
armlet
of
so
that
color
went
with
them
on
their
way
often
one
saw
the
starting
for
an
afternoon
ride
a
fine
figure
nobly
mounted
with
two
and
an
escort
of
lancers
a
pretty
sight
with
fluttering
pennons
on
all
their
lances
and
horses
groomed
to
the
last
hair
it
was
prettier
than
the
real
thing
up
in
the
salient
or
beyond
the
somme
where
dead
bodies
lay
in
upheaved
earth
among
ruins
and
slaughtered
trees
war
at
montreuil
was
quite
a
pleasant
occupation
for
elderly
generals
who
liked
their
little
stroll
after
lunch
and
for
young
regular
officers
released
from
the
painful
necessity
of
dying
for
their
country
who
were
glad
to
get
a
game
of
tennis
down
below
the
walls
there
after
strenuous
in
which
they
had
written
passed
to
you
on
many
minutes
or
had
drawn
the
most
comical
caricatures
of
their
immediate
chief
and
of
his
immediate
chief
on
and
it
seemed
at
a
mere
glance
that
all
these
military
inhabitants
of
were
great
and
glorious
soldiers
some
of
the
youngest
of
them
had
a
row
of
decorations
from
montenegro
serbia
italy
rumania
and
other
states
as
recognition
of
gallant
service
in
translating
german
letters
found
in
dugouts
by
the
or
arranging
for
visits
of
political
personages
to
the
back
areas
of
war
or
initialing
requisitions
for
pink
blue
green
and
yellow
forms
which
in
due
course
would
find
their
way
to
battalion
adjutants
for
immediate
in
the
middle
of
an
action
the
oldest
of
them
those
generals
in
the
administrative
side
of
war
had
started
their
third
row
of
ribbons
well
before
the
end
of
the
somme
battles
and
had
on
their
breasts
by
the
time
the
massacres
had
been
accomplished
in
the
fields
of
flanders
i
know
an
officer
who
was
awarded
the
because
he
had
hindered
the
work
of
war
correspondents
with
the
zeal
of
a
in
search
of
worms
and
another
who
was
the
man
in
the
army
because
he
had
presided
over
a
visitors
chateau
and
entertained
royalties
members
of
parliament
humphry
ward
miners
japanese
russian
revolutionaries
portuguese
ministers
harry
lauder
swedes
danes
norwegians
clergymen
montenegrins
and
the
editor
of
john
bull
at
the
government
expense
and
i
am
bound
to
say
he
deserved
them
all
being
a
man
of
infinite
tact
many
languages
and
a
devastating
sense
of
humor
there
was
always
a
charlie
chaplin
film
between
moving
pictures
of
the
battles
of
the
somme
he
brought
the
actualities
of
war
to
the
visitors
chateau
by
outside
the
door
a
toy
tank
in
the
front
garden
and
a
collection
of
war
trophies
in
the
hall
he
spoke
to
high
personages
with
less
deference
than
he
showed
to
miners
from
durham
and
wales
and
was
master
of
them
always
ordering
them
sternly
to
bed
at
ten
when
he
sat
down
to
bridge
with
his
junior
officers
and
with
strict
military
discipline
insisting
upon
their
inspection
of
the
bakeries
at
boulogne
and
factories
at
calais
as
part
of
the
glory
of
war
which
they
had
come
out
for
to
see
so
it
was
that
there
were
brilliant
colors
in
the
streets
of
montreuil
and
at
every
doorway
a
sentry
slapped
his
hand
to
his
rifle
with
smart
and
untiring
iteration
as
the
brains
of
the
army
under
brass
hats
and
red
bands
went
hither
and
thither
in
the
town
looking
stern
as
soldiers
of
grave
responsibility
answering
salutes
absent
mindedly
staring
haughtily
at
young
battalion
officers
who
passed
through
montreuil
and
looked
meekly
for
a
chance
of
a
to
boulogne
on
seven
days
leave
from
the
lines
the
smart
society
of
was
best
seen
at
the
officers
club
in
montreuil
at
it
was
as
much
like
musical
comedy
as
any
stage
setting
of
war
at
the
gaiety
a
band
played
ragtime
and
light
music
while
the
warriors
fed
and
all
these
generals
and
staff
officers
with
their
decorations
and
and
polished
buttons
and
crossed
swords
were
waited
upon
by
little
a
with
the
colors
tied
up
in
bows
on
their
hair
and
khaki
stockings
under
their
short
skirts
and
fancy
aprons
such
a
chatter
such
bursts
of
laughter
such
whisperings
of
secrets
and
intrigues
and
scandals
in
high
places
such
careless
hearted
courage
when
british
soldiers
were
being
blown
to
bits
gassed
blinded
maimed
and
in
places
that
were
far
so
very
far
from
xi
there
were
shrill
voices
one
morning
outside
the
gate
of
our
quarters
women
voices
excited
angry
passionate
an
orderly
came
into
the
mess
we
were
at
breakfast
and
explained
the
meaning
of
the
clamor
which
by
some
intuition
and
a
quick
ear
for
french
he
had
gathered
from
all
this
confusion
of
tongues
there
a
soldier
up
the
road
drunk
or
mad
he
has
been
attacking
a
girl
the
villagers
want
an
officer
to
arrest
the
colonel
sliced
off
the
top
of
his
egg
and
then
rose
tell
three
orderlies
to
follow
we
went
into
the
roadway
and
twenty
women
crowded
round
us
with
a
story
of
attempted
violence
against
an
innocent
girl
the
man
had
been
drinking
last
night
at
the
estaminet
up
there
then
he
had
followed
the
girl
trying
to
make
love
to
her
she
had
barricaded
herself
in
the
room
when
he
tried
to
climb
through
the
window
if
you
do
come
out
i
get
in
and
kill
you
he
said
according
to
the
women
but
she
had
kept
him
out
though
he
prowled
round
all
night
now
he
was
hiding
in
an
outhouse
the
brute
the
pig
when
we
went
up
the
road
the
man
was
standing
in
the
center
of
it
with
a
sullen
look
what
the
trouble
he
asked
it
looks
as
if
all
france
were
out
to
grab
he
glanced
sideways
over
the
field
as
though
reckoning
his
chance
of
escape
there
was
no
chance
the
colonel
placed
him
under
arrest
and
he
marched
back
between
the
orderlies
with
an
old
soldier
of
the
contemptibles
behind
him
later
in
the
day
he
was
lined
up
for
identification
by
the
girl
among
a
crowd
of
other
men
the
girl
looked
down
the
line
and
we
watched
her
curiously
a
slim
creature
with
dark
hair
neatly
coiled
she
stretched
out
her
right
hand
with
a
pointing
finger
le
voila
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
and
the
man
looked
sheepishly
at
her
not
denying
he
was
sent
off
under
escort
to
the
military
prison
in
omer
for
what
the
punishment
if
guilty
i
asked
death
said
the
colonel
resuming
his
egg
he
was
a
fellow
the
prisoner
he
had
answered
the
call
for
king
and
country
without
delay
in
the
estaminet
after
coming
down
from
the
salient
for
a
course
he
had
drunk
more
beer
than
was
good
for
him
and
the
face
of
a
pretty
girl
had
bewitched
him
stirring
up
desire
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
lips
there
were
no
women
in
the
ypres
salient
nothing
pretty
or
soft
it
was
hell
up
there
and
this
girl
was
a
pretty
witch
bringing
back
thoughts
of
the
other
side
for
life
womanhood
love
caresses
which
were
good
for
the
souls
and
bodies
of
men
it
was
a
starved
life
up
there
in
the
salient
why
she
give
him
her
lips
was
he
fighting
for
france
was
he
a
tall
and
proper
lad
curse
the
girl
for
being
so
sulky
to
an
english
soldier
and
now
if
those
other
women
those
old
hags
were
to
swear
against
him
things
he
had
never
said
things
he
had
never
done
unless
drink
had
made
him
forget
by
god
supposing
drink
had
made
him
forget
he
would
be
shot
against
a
white
wall
shot
dead
disgracefully
shamefully
by
his
own
comrades
o
christ
and
the
little
mother
in
a
sussex
cottage
xii
going
up
to
kemmel
one
day
i
had
to
wait
in
battalion
headquarters
for
the
officer
i
had
gone
to
see
he
was
attending
a
court
martial
presently
he
came
into
the
wooden
hut
with
a
flushed
face
sorry
i
had
to
keep
you
he
said
tomorrow
there
will
be
one
swine
less
in
the
a
death
sentence
he
nodded
a
damned
coward
said
he
did
mind
but
could
stand
shells
admitted
he
left
his
post
he
does
mind
well
tomorrow
the
officer
laughed
grimly
and
then
listened
for
a
second
there
were
some
heavy
crumps
falling
over
kemmel
hill
rather
close
it
seemed
to
our
wooden
hut
damn
those
german
gunners
said
the
officer
why
ca
they
give
us
a
little
peace
he
turned
to
his
papers
but
several
times
while
i
talked
with
him
he
jerked
his
head
up
and
listened
to
a
heavy
crash
on
the
way
back
i
saw
a
man
on
foot
walking
in
front
of
a
mounted
man
past
the
old
hill
of
the
scherpenberg
toward
the
village
of
locre
there
was
something
in
the
way
he
walked
in
his
attitude
the
head
hunched
forward
a
little
and
his
arms
behind
his
back
which
made
me
turn
to
look
at
him
he
was
manacled
and
tied
by
a
rope
to
the
mounted
man
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
his
face
and
then
turned
away
cold
and
sick
there
was
doom
written
on
his
face
and
in
his
eyes
a
captured
look
he
was
walking
to
his
wall
xiii
there
were
other
men
who
could
not
stand
it
filled
them
with
an
animal
terror
and
took
all
out
of
them
one
young
officer
was
like
that
man
who
did
not
mind
he
by
some
strange
freak
of
psychology
was
brave
under
fire
he
had
done
several
gallant
things
and
was
bright
and
cheerful
in
the
trenches
until
the
enemy
barraged
them
with
high
explosive
then
he
was
seen
wandering
back
to
the
support
trenches
in
a
dazed
way
it
happened
three
times
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death
before
going
out
at
dawn
to
face
the
he
was
calm
there
was
a
lighted
candle
on
the
table
and
he
sorted
out
his
personal
belongings
and
made
small
packages
of
them
as
keepsakes
for
his
family
and
friends
his
hand
did
not
tremble
when
his
time
came
he
put
out
the
candle
between
thumb
and
finger
raised
his
hand
and
said
right
o
another
man
shot
for
cowardice
in
face
of
the
enemy
was
sullen
and
silent
to
one
who
hoped
to
comfort
him
in
the
last
hour
the
chaplain
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
message
for
his
relatives
he
said
i
have
no
he
was
asked
whether
he
would
like
to
say
any
prayers
and
he
said
i
do
believe
in
the
chaplain
talked
to
him
but
could
get
no
answer
and
time
was
creeping
on
there
were
two
guards
in
the
room
sitting
motionless
with
loaded
rifles
between
their
knees
outside
it
was
silent
in
the
courtyard
except
for
little
noises
of
the
night
and
the
wind
the
chaplain
suffered
and
was
torn
with
pity
for
that
sullen
man
whose
life
was
almost
at
an
end
he
took
out
his
hymn
book
and
said
i
will
sing
to
you
it
will
pass
the
he
sang
a
hymn
and
once
or
twice
his
voice
broke
a
little
but
he
steadied
it
then
the
man
said
i
will
sing
with
he
knew
all
the
hymns
words
and
music
it
was
an
unusual
astonishing
knowledge
and
he
went
on
singing
hymn
after
hymn
with
the
chaplain
by
his
side
it
was
the
chaplain
who
tired
first
his
voice
cracked
and
his
throat
became
parched
sweat
broke
out
on
his
forehead
because
of
the
nervous
strain
but
the
man
who
was
going
to
die
sang
on
in
a
clear
hard
voice
a
faint
glimmer
of
coming
dawn
lightened
the
cottage
window
there
were
not
many
minutes
more
the
two
guards
shifted
their
feet
now
said
the
man
we
sing
save
the
king
the
two
guards
rose
and
stood
at
attention
and
the
chaplain
sang
the
national
anthem
with
the
man
who
was
to
be
shot
for
cowardice
then
the
tramp
of
the
came
across
the
cobblestones
in
the
courtyard
it
was
dawn
xiv
was
the
worst
thing
to
see
there
were
generals
who
said
there
is
no
such
thing
as
it
is
cowardice
i
would
in
every
doctors
said
it
is
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
and
blue
funk
both
are
physical
as
well
as
mental
often
it
is
the
destruction
of
the
nerve
tissues
by
concussion
or
actual
physical
damage
to
the
brain
sometimes
it
is
a
shock
of
horror
unbalancing
the
mind
but
that
is
more
rare
it
is
not
generally
the
slight
nervous
men
who
suffer
worst
from
it
is
often
the
stolid
fellow
one
of
those
we
describe
as
being
utterly
without
nerves
who
goes
down
badly
something
snaps
in
him
he
has
no
resilience
in
his
nervous
system
he
has
never
trained
himself
in
being
so
stolid
and
now
the
nervous
man
the
cockney
for
example
is
always
training
himself
in
the
control
of
his
nerves
on
which
lurch
round
corners
in
the
traffic
that
bears
down
on
him
in
a
thousand
and
one
situations
which
demand
in
a
man
that
helps
him
in
war
whereas
the
yokel
or
the
sergeant
major
type
is
splendid
until
the
shock
comes
then
he
may
crack
but
there
is
no
law
imagination
apprehension
are
the
devil
too
and
they
go
with
it
was
a
whom
i
saw
stricken
badly
with
in
aveluy
wood
near
thiepval
he
was
convulsed
with
a
dreadful
rigor
like
a
man
in
epilepsy
and
clawed
at
his
mouth
moaning
horribly
with
livid
terror
in
his
eyes
he
had
to
be
strapped
to
a
stretcher
before
he
could
be
carried
away
he
had
been
a
tall
and
splendid
man
this
poor
lunatic
nearer
to
thiepval
during
the
fighting
there
other
men
were
brought
down
with
i
remember
one
of
them
now
though
i
saw
many
others
he
was
a
wiltshire
lad
very
young
with
an
face
and
eyes
he
stood
outside
a
dugout
shaking
in
every
limb
in
a
palsied
way
his
steel
hat
was
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
mouth
slobbered
and
two
comrades
could
not
hold
him
still
these
badly
boys
clawed
their
mouths
ceaselessly
it
was
a
common
dreadful
action
others
sat
in
the
field
hospitals
in
a
state
of
coma
dazed
as
though
deaf
and
actually
dumb
i
hated
to
see
them
turned
my
eyes
away
from
them
and
yet
wished
that
they
might
be
seen
by
men
and
women
who
far
behind
the
lines
still
spoke
of
war
lightly
as
a
kind
of
sport
or
heroic
game
which
brave
boys
liked
or
ought
to
like
and
said
we
fight
on
to
the
last
man
rather
than
accept
anything
less
than
absolute
victory
and
when
victory
came
said
we
stopped
too
soon
we
ought
to
have
gone
on
for
another
three
it
was
for
to
say
those
things
because
they
knew
the
things
they
suffered
and
risked
that
word
we
was
not
to
be
used
by
gentlemen
in
government
offices
scared
of
air
raids
nor
by
women
dancing
in
scanty
frocks
at
for
the
poor
dear
wounded
nor
even
by
generals
at
enjoying
the
thrill
of
war
without
its
dirt
and
danger
seeing
these
cases
month
after
month
during
years
of
fighting
i
as
an
onlooker
hated
the
people
who
had
not
seen
and
were
callous
of
this
misery
the
laughing
girls
in
the
strand
greeting
the
boys
on
seven
days
leave
the
newspaper
editors
and
whose
articles
on
war
were
always
cheery
the
bishops
and
clergy
who
praised
god
as
the
of
the
allied
armies
and
had
never
said
a
word
before
the
war
to
make
it
less
inevitable
the
schoolmasters
who
gloried
in
the
lengthening
roll
of
honor
and
said
we
doing
very
well
when
more
boys
died
the
pretty
ogling
in
the
as
well
known
the
who
were
getting
good
wages
out
of
the
war
the
who
were
buying
gramophones
and
furs
while
their
men
were
in
the
stinking
trenches
the
dreadful
callous
cheerful
spirit
of
england
at
war
often
i
was
unfair
bitter
unbalanced
wrong
the
spirit
of
england
taking
it
broad
and
large
with
dreadful
exceptions
was
wonderful
in
its
courage
and
patience
and
ached
with
sympathy
for
its
fighting
sons
and
was
stricken
with
the
tragedy
of
all
this
slaughter
there
were
many
tears
in
english
homes
many
sad
and
lonely
women
but
as
an
onlooker
i
could
not
be
just
or
fair
and
hated
the
who
did
not
reveal
its
wound
in
their
souls
but
were
placid
in
their
belief
that
we
should
win
and
pleased
with
themselves
because
of
their
easy
optimism
so
easy
for
those
who
did
not
see
xv
as
war
correspondents
we
were
supposed
to
have
honorary
rank
as
captains
by
custom
and
tradition
but
it
amounted
to
nothing
here
or
there
we
were
civilians
in
khaki
with
green
bands
round
our
right
arms
and
uncertain
status
it
was
better
so
because
we
were
in
the
peculiar
and
privileged
position
of
being
able
to
speak
to
tommies
and
sergeants
as
human
beings
to
be
on
terms
of
comradeship
with
junior
subalterns
and
battalion
commanders
and
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
generals
without
embarrassment
to
them
or
to
ourselves
physically
many
of
our
generals
were
curiously
alike
they
were
men
turned
fifty
with
square
jaws
tanned
ruddy
faces
searching
and
rather
stern
gray
eyes
closely
cropped
hair
growing
white
with
a
little
white
mustache
neatly
trimmed
on
the
upper
lip
mentally
they
had
similar
qualities
they
had
unfailing
physical
courage
though
courage
is
not
put
to
the
test
much
in
modern
generalship
which
above
the
rank
of
brigadier
works
far
from
the
actual
line
of
battle
unless
it
slips
in
the
wrong
direction
they
were
stern
disciplinarians
and
tested
the
quality
of
troops
by
their
smartness
in
saluting
and
on
parade
which
did
not
account
for
the
fighting
merit
of
the
australians
most
of
them
were
conservative
by
political
tradition
and
hereditary
instinct
and
conservative
also
in
military
ideas
and
methods
they
distrusted
the
brilliant
fellow
and
were
inclined
to
think
him
unsafe
and
they
were
not
quick
to
allow
young
men
to
gain
high
command
at
the
expense
of
their
gray
hair
and
experience
they
were
industrious
able
conscientious
men
never
sparing
themselves
long
hours
of
work
for
a
life
of
ease
and
because
they
were
willing
to
sacrifice
their
own
lives
if
need
be
for
their
country
sake
they
demanded
equal
willingness
of
sacrifice
from
every
officer
and
man
under
their
authority
having
no
mercy
whatever
for
the
slacker
or
the
weakling
among
them
there
was
not
one
whose
personality
had
that
mysterious
but
essential
quality
of
great
generalship
inspiring
large
bodies
of
men
with
exalted
enthusiasm
devotion
and
faith
it
did
not
matter
to
the
men
whether
an
army
commander
a
corps
commander
or
a
divisional
commander
stood
in
the
roadside
to
watch
them
march
past
on
their
way
to
battle
or
on
their
way
back
they
saw
one
of
these
sturdy
men
in
his
brass
hat
with
his
ruddy
face
and
white
mustache
but
no
thrill
passed
down
their
ranks
no
hoarse
cheers
broke
from
them
because
he
was
there
as
when
wellington
sat
on
his
white
horse
in
the
peninsular
war
or
as
when
napoleon
saluted
his
old
guard
or
even
as
when
lord
roberts
our
bob
came
perched
like
a
little
old
falcon
on
his
big
charger
nine
men
out
of
ten
in
the
ranks
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
their
army
general
or
of
the
corps
commander
it
meant
nothing
to
them
they
did
not
face
death
with
more
passionate
courage
to
win
the
approval
of
a
military
idol
that
was
due
partly
to
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
which
make
it
difficult
for
generals
of
high
rank
to
get
into
direct
personal
touch
with
their
troops
and
to
the
masses
of
men
engaged
but
those
difficulties
could
have
been
overcome
by
a
general
of
impressive
personality
able
to
stir
the
imaginations
of
men
by
words
of
fire
spoken
at
the
right
time
by
deep
human
sympathy
and
by
the
luck
of
victory
seized
by
daring
adventure
against
great
odds
no
such
man
appeared
on
the
western
front
until
foch
obtained
the
supreme
command
on
the
british
front
there
was
no
general
with
the
gift
of
speech
a
gift
too
much
despised
by
our
british
men
of
action
or
with
a
character
and
prestige
which
could
raise
him
to
the
highest
rank
in
popular
imagination
during
the
retreat
from
mona
sir
john
french
had
a
touch
of
that
personal
power
his
presence
meant
something
to
the
men
because
of
his
reputation
in
south
africa
but
afterward
when
trench
warfare
began
and
the
daily
routine
of
slaughter
under
german
when
our
artillery
was
weak
and
when
our
infantry
was
ordered
to
attack
fixed
positions
of
terrible
strength
without
adequate
support
and
not
a
dog
chance
of
luck
against
such
odds
the
prestige
of
the
faded
from
men
minds
and
he
lost
place
in
their
admiration
it
was
washed
out
in
blood
and
mud
sir
douglas
haig
who
followed
sir
john
french
inherited
the
disillusionment
of
armies
who
saw
now
that
war
on
the
western
front
was
to
be
a
long
struggle
with
enormous
slaughter
and
no
visible
sign
of
the
end
beyond
a
vista
of
dreadful
years
sir
douglas
haig
in
his
general
headquarters
at
and
afterward
at
montreuil
near
the
coast
had
the
affection
and
loyalty
of
the
staff
officers
a
man
of
remarkably
good
looks
with
fine
delicate
features
strengthened
by
the
firm
line
of
his
jaw
and
of
singular
sweetness
courtesy
and
simplicity
in
his
manner
toward
all
who
approached
him
he
had
qualities
which
might
have
raised
him
to
the
supreme
height
of
personal
influence
among
his
armies
but
for
lack
of
the
magic
touch
and
the
tragic
condition
of
his
command
he
was
intensely
shy
and
reserved
shrinking
from
publicity
and
holding
himself
aloof
from
the
human
side
of
war
he
was
constitutionally
unable
to
make
a
dramatic
gesture
before
a
multitude
or
to
say
easy
stirring
things
to
officers
and
men
whom
he
reviewed
his
shyness
and
reserve
prevented
him
also
from
knowing
as
much
as
he
ought
to
have
known
about
the
opinions
of
officers
and
men
and
getting
direct
information
from
them
he
held
the
supreme
command
of
the
british
armies
on
the
western
front
when
in
the
battlefields
of
the
somme
and
flanders
of
picardy
and
artois
there
was
not
much
chance
for
daring
strategy
but
only
for
by
the
flesh
and
blood
of
men
against
fortress
positions
the
german
trench
systems
miles
deep
in
tunneled
earthworks
and
dugouts
when
the
immensity
of
casualties
among
british
troops
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
gains
of
ground
so
that
our
men
spirits
revolted
against
these
massacres
of
their
youth
and
they
were
embittered
against
the
generalship
and
which
directed
these
sacrificial
actions
this
sense
of
bitterness
became
intense
to
the
point
of
fury
so
that
a
young
staff
officer
in
his
red
tabs
with
a
jaunty
manner
was
like
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
among
battalion
officers
and
men
and
they
desired
his
death
exceedingly
exalting
his
little
personality
dressed
in
a
tunic
and
and
highly
polished
into
the
supreme
folly
of
the
staff
which
made
men
attack
impossible
positions
send
down
conflicting
orders
issued
a
litter
of
documents
called
by
an
ugly
name
containing
impracticable
instructions
to
the
torment
of
the
adjutants
and
to
the
scorn
of
the
troops
this
hatred
of
the
staff
was
stoked
high
by
the
fires
of
passion
and
despair
some
of
it
was
unjust
and
even
the
jaunty
young
a
o
with
red
tabs
and
polished
boots
was
often
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
he
looked
but
a
fellow
who
had
proved
his
pluck
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
and
was
now
doing
his
duty
about
equal
to
the
work
of
a
boy
clerk
with
real
industry
and
an
exaggerated
sense
of
its
importance
personally
i
can
pay
high
tribute
to
some
of
our
staff
officers
at
divisional
corps
and
army
headquarters
because
of
their
industry
efficiency
and
devotion
to
duty
and
during
the
progress
of
battle
i
have
seen
them
hundreds
of
times
working
desperately
for
long
hours
without
much
rest
or
sleep
so
that
the
should
get
their
food
and
munitions
so
that
the
artillery
should
support
their
actions
and
the
troops
in
reserve
move
up
to
their
relief
at
the
proper
time
and
place
owing
largely
to
new
army
brains
the
administrative
side
of
our
war
became
efficient
in
its
method
and
organization
and
the
armies
were
worked
like
clockwork
machines
the
transport
was
good
beyond
all
words
of
praise
and
there
was
one
thing
which
seldom
failed
to
reach
poor
old
tommy
atkins
unless
he
was
cut
off
by
and
that
was
his
food
the
columns
and
were
organized
to
the
last
item
our
map
department
was
magnificent
and
the
admiration
of
the
french
our
intelligence
branch
became
valuable
apart
from
a
frequent
insanity
of
optimism
and
was
sometimes
uncanny
in
the
accuracy
of
its
information
about
the
enemy
disposition
and
plans
so
that
the
staff
was
not
altogether
hopeless
in
its
effect
as
the
young
battalion
officers
with
sharp
tongues
and
a
sense
of
injustice
in
their
hearts
made
out
with
pardonable
blasphemy
in
their
dugouts
nevertheless
the
system
was
bad
and
british
generalship
made
many
mistakes
some
of
them
no
doubt
unavoidable
because
it
is
human
to
err
and
some
of
them
due
to
sheer
simple
impregnable
stupidity
in
the
early
days
the
outstanding
fault
of
our
generals
was
their
desire
to
gain
ground
which
was
utterly
worthless
when
gained
they
organized
small
attacks
against
strong
positions
dreadfully
costly
to
take
and
after
the
desperate
valor
of
men
had
seized
a
few
yards
of
mangled
earth
found
that
they
had
made
another
small
salient
jutting
out
from
their
front
in
a
wedge
so
that
it
was
a
for
the
men
who
had
to
hold
it
this
was
done
again
and
again
and
i
remember
one
distinguished
officer
saying
with
bitter
irony
remembering
how
many
of
his
men
had
died
our
generals
must
have
their
little
v
at
any
price
to
justify
themselves
at
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
they
attacked
isolated
objectives
on
narrow
fronts
so
that
the
enemy
swept
our
men
with
fire
by
artillery
concentrated
from
all
points
instead
of
having
to
disperse
his
fire
during
a
general
attack
on
a
wide
front
in
the
days
of
trench
warfare
when
the
enemy
artillery
was
much
stronger
than
ours
and
when
his
infantry
strength
was
enormously
greater
our
generals
insisted
upon
the
british
troops
maintaining
an
aggressive
attitude
with
the
result
that
they
were
shot
to
pieces
instead
of
adopting
like
the
french
a
quiet
and
waiting
attitude
until
the
time
came
for
a
sharp
and
terrible
blow
the
battles
of
neuve
chapelle
fertubert
and
loos
in
cost
us
thousands
of
dead
and
gave
us
no
gain
of
any
account
and
both
generalship
and
were
in
the
opinion
of
most
officers
who
know
anything
of
those
battles
ghastly
after
all
our
generals
had
to
learn
their
lesson
like
the
private
soldier
and
the
young
battalion
officer
in
conditions
of
warfare
which
had
never
been
seen
before
and
it
was
bad
for
the
private
soldier
and
the
young
battalion
officer
who
died
so
they
might
learn
as
time
went
on
improved
and
british
generalship
was
less
rash
in
optimism
and
less
rigid
in
ideas
xvi
general
haldane
was
friendly
to
the
war
correspondents
he
had
been
something
of
the
kind
himself
in
earlier
days
and
we
were
welcomed
at
his
headquarters
both
when
he
commanded
the
division
and
afterward
when
he
became
commander
of
the
corps
i
thought
during
the
war
and
i
think
now
that
he
had
more
intellect
and
quality
than
many
of
our
other
generals
a
tall
strongly
built
man
with
a
distinction
of
movement
and
gesture
not
stocky
or
rigid
but
nervous
and
restless
he
gave
one
a
sense
of
power
and
intensity
of
purpose
there
was
a
kind
of
fire
in
him
a
hatred
of
the
enemy
which
was
not
weakened
in
him
by
any
mercy
and
a
consuming
rage
as
it
appeared
to
me
against
inefficiency
in
high
places
injustice
of
which
he
may
have
felt
himself
to
be
the
victim
and
restrictions
upon
his
liberty
of
command
a
bitter
irony
was
often
in
his
laughter
when
discussing
politicians
at
home
and
the
wider
strategy
of
war
apart
from
that
on
his
own
front
he
was
intolerant
of
stupidity
which
he
found
widespread
and
there
was
no
tenderness
or
emotion
in
his
attitude
toward
life
the
officers
and
men
under
his
command
accused
him
of
ruthlessness
but
they
admitted
that
he
took
more
personal
risk
than
he
need
have
done
as
a
divisional
general
and
was
constantly
in
the
trenches
examining
his
line
they
also
acknowledged
that
he
was
generous
in
his
praise
of
their
good
service
though
merciless
if
he
found
fault
with
them
he
held
himself
aloof
too
much
i
am
sure
from
his
battalion
officers
and
had
an
extreme
haughtiness
of
bearing
which
was
partly
due
to
reserve
and
that
shyness
which
is
in
many
englishmen
and
a
few
scots
in
the
old
salient
warfare
he
often
demanded
service
in
the
way
of
raids
and
the
holding
of
and
the
execution
of
minor
attacks
which
caused
many
casualties
and
filled
men
with
rage
and
horror
at
what
they
believed
to
be
unnecessary
waste
of
life
their
life
and
their
comrades
that
did
not
make
for
popularity
in
the
ranks
of
the
battalion
messes
privately
in
his
own
mess
he
was
gracious
to
visitors
and
revealed
not
only
a
wide
range
of
knowledge
outside
as
well
as
inside
his
profession
but
a
curious
unexpected
sympathy
for
ideas
not
belonging
as
a
rule
to
generals
of
the
old
caste
i
liked
him
though
i
was
always
conscious
of
that
flame
and
steel
in
his
nature
which
made
his
psychology
a
world
away
from
mine
he
was
hit
hard
in
what
i
think
was
the
softest
spot
in
his
heart
by
the
death
of
one
of
his
young
congreve
who
was
the
beau
ideal
of
knighthood
wonderfully
handsome
elegant
even
when
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
wet
mud
as
i
saw
him
one
day
fearless
or
at
least
scornful
of
danger
to
the
verge
of
recklessness
general
haldane
had
marked
him
out
as
the
most
promising
young
soldier
in
the
whole
army
a
bit
of
shell
a
senseless
bit
of
steel
spoiled
that
promise
as
it
spoiled
the
promise
of
a
million
boys
and
the
general
was
saddened
more
than
by
the
death
of
other
gallant
officers
i
have
one
memory
of
general
haldane
which
shows
him
in
a
different
light
it
was
during
the
great
german
offensive
in
the
north
when
arras
was
hard
beset
and
the
enemy
had
come
back
over
monchy
hill
and
was
shelling
villages
on
the
western
side
of
arras
which
until
then
had
been
undamaged
it
was
in
one
of
these
villages
near
to
which
the
general
had
come
back
with
his
corps
headquarters
established
there
for
many
months
in
earlier
days
so
that
the
peasants
and
their
children
knew
him
well
by
sight
and
had
talked
with
him
because
he
liked
to
speak
french
with
them
when
i
went
to
see
him
one
day
during
that
bad
time
in
april
of
he
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
children
who
were
asking
anxiously
whether
arras
would
be
taken
he
drew
a
map
for
them
in
the
dust
of
the
roadway
and
showed
them
where
the
enemy
was
attacking
and
the
general
strategy
he
spoke
simply
and
gravely
as
though
to
a
group
of
and
the
children
followed
his
diagram
in
the
dust
and
understood
him
perfectly
they
will
not
take
arras
if
i
can
help
it
he
said
you
will
be
all
right
xvii
sir
neville
macready
was
in
the
days
of
sir
john
french
and
i
dined
at
his
mess
once
or
twice
and
he
came
to
ours
on
return
visits
the
son
of
macready
the
actor
he
had
a
subtlety
of
mind
not
common
among
british
generals
to
whom
subtlety
in
any
form
is
repulsive
his
sense
of
humor
was
developed
upon
lines
of
irony
and
he
had
a
sly
twinkle
in
his
eyes
before
telling
one
of
his
innumerable
anecdotes
they
were
good
stories
and
i
remember
one
of
them
which
had
to
do
with
the
retreat
from
mons
it
was
not
to
tell
the
truth
that
orderly
retreat
which
is
described
in
accounts
there
were
times
when
it
was
a
wild
stampede
from
the
tightening
loop
of
a
german
advance
with
lorries
and
and
transport
wagons
going
among
civilian
refugees
and
mixed
battalions
and
stragglers
from
every
unit
walking
footsore
in
small
groups
even
general
headquarters
was
flurried
at
times
far
in
advance
of
this
procession
backward
one
night
sir
neville
macready
with
the
judge
advocate
and
an
officer
named
colonel
childs
a
fellow
took
up
their
quarters
in
a
french
chateau
somewhere
i
think
in
the
neighborhood
of
creil
the
was
in
another
chateau
some
distance
away
other
branches
of
were
billeted
in
private
houses
widely
scattered
about
a
straggling
village
colonel
childs
was
writing
opposite
the
who
was
working
silently
presently
childs
looked
up
listened
and
said
it
rather
quiet
sir
so
much
the
better
growled
general
macready
get
on
with
your
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
no
rumble
of
traffic
passed
by
the
windows
no
were
jolting
over
french
pave
colonel
childs
looked
up
again
and
listened
it
damned
quiet
outside
well
do
go
making
a
noise
said
the
general
ca
you
see
busy
i
think
i
just
take
a
turn
round
said
colonel
childs
he
felt
uneasy
something
in
the
silence
of
the
village
scared
him
he
went
out
into
the
roadway
and
walked
toward
sir
john
french
quarters
there
was
no
challenge
from
a
sentry
the
british
expeditionary
force
seemed
to
be
sleeping
they
needed
sleep
poor
beggars
but
the
germans
did
not
let
them
take
much
colonel
childs
went
into
the
chateau
and
found
a
soldier
in
the
front
hall
licking
out
a
where
the
asked
the
officer
gone
hours
ago
sir
said
the
soldier
i
was
left
behind
for
lack
of
transport
from
what
i
hear
the
germans
ought
to
be
here
by
now
i
rather
fancy
i
heard
some
shots
pretty
close
awhile
colonel
childs
walked
back
to
his
own
quarters
quickly
he
made
no
apology
for
interrupting
the
work
of
the
general
the
whole
box
of
tricks
has
gone
we
been
left
behind
forgotten
the
dirty
dogs
said
general
macready
there
was
not
much
time
for
packing
up
and
only
one
and
only
one
rifle
the
general
said
he
would
look
after
the
rifle
but
colonel
childs
said
if
that
were
so
he
would
rather
stay
behind
and
take
his
chance
of
being
captured
it
would
be
safer
for
him
so
the
the
judge
advocate
the
deputy
assistant
judge
advocate
colonel
childs
and
an
orderly
or
two
packed
into
the
car
and
set
out
to
find
before
they
found
it
they
had
to
run
the
gantlet
of
germans
and
were
sniped
all
the
way
through
a
wood
and
took
flying
shots
at
moving
figures
then
miles
away
they
found
and
were
they
sorry
to
see
me
again
said
general
macready
who
told
me
the
tale
they
thought
they
had
lost
me
the
day
casualty
list
was
brought
into
the
adjutant
general
one
evening
when
i
was
dining
in
his
mess
the
orderly
put
it
down
by
the
side
of
his
plate
and
he
interrupted
a
funny
story
to
glance
down
the
columns
of
names
du
maurier
has
been
killed
i
he
put
down
the
paper
beside
his
plate
again
and
continued
his
story
and
we
all
laughed
heartily
at
the
end
of
the
anecdote
it
was
the
only
way
and
the
soldier
way
there
was
no
hugging
of
grief
when
our
best
friend
fell
a
sigh
another
ghost
in
one
life
and
then
carry
on
xviii
scores
of
times
hundreds
of
times
during
the
battles
of
the
somme
i
passed
the
headquarters
of
sir
henry
rawlinson
commanding
the
fourth
army
and
several
times
i
met
the
army
commander
there
and
elsewhere
one
of
my
first
meetings
with
him
was
extraordinarily
embarrassing
to
me
for
a
moment
or
two
while
he
was
organizing
his
army
which
was
to
be
called
with
unconscious
irony
the
army
of
pursuit
the
battles
of
the
somme
were
a
siege
rather
than
a
pursuit
he
desired
to
take
over
the
chateau
at
tilques
in
which
the
war
correspondents
were
then
quartered
as
we
were
paying
for
it
and
liked
it
we
put
up
an
opposition
which
was
most
annoying
to
his
especially
to
one
young
gentleman
of
enormous
wealth
haughty
manners
and
a
boyish
intolerance
of
other
people
interests
who
had
looked
over
our
rooms
without
troubling
to
knock
at
the
doors
and
then
said
this
will
suit
us
down
to
the
on
my
way
back
from
the
salient
one
evening
i
walked
up
the
drive
in
the
flickering
light
of
summer
eve
and
saw
two
officers
coming
in
my
direction
one
of
whom
i
thought
i
recognized
as
an
old
friend
hullo
i
said
cheerily
you
here
again
then
i
saw
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
sir
henry
rawlinson
he
must
have
been
surprised
but
dug
me
in
the
ribs
in
a
genial
way
and
said
hullo
young
feller
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
pinch
our
quarters
but
my
familiar
method
of
address
could
not
have
produced
that
result
his
headquarters
at
querrieux
were
in
another
old
chateau
on
the
road
surrounded
by
pleasant
fields
through
which
a
stream
wound
its
way
everywhere
the
were
red
and
a
military
policeman
authorized
to
secure
obedience
to
the
rules
thereon
slowed
down
every
on
its
way
through
the
village
as
though
sir
henry
rawlinson
lay
sick
of
a
fever
so
anxious
were
his
gestures
and
his
expression
of
hush
do
be
careful
the
army
commander
seemed
to
me
to
have
a
roguish
eye
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
to
himself
this
war
is
a
rare
old
joke
he
spoke
habitually
of
the
enemy
as
the
old
hun
or
old
fritz
in
an
affectionate
contemptuous
way
as
a
fellow
who
was
trying
his
best
but
getting
the
worst
of
it
every
time
before
the
battles
of
the
somme
i
had
a
talk
with
him
among
his
maps
and
found
that
i
had
been
to
many
places
in
his
line
which
he
did
not
seem
to
know
he
could
not
find
there
very
quickly
on
his
maps
or
pretended
not
to
though
i
concluded
that
this
was
camouflage
in
case
i
might
tell
old
fritz
that
such
places
existed
like
most
of
our
generals
he
had
amazing
overweening
optimism
he
had
always
got
the
enemy
nearly
beat
and
he
arranged
attacks
during
the
somme
fighting
with
the
jovial
sense
of
striking
another
blow
which
would
lead
this
time
to
stupendous
results
in
the
early
days
in
command
of
the
division
he
had
done
well
and
he
was
a
gallant
soldier
with
initiative
and
courage
of
decision
and
a
quick
intelligence
in
open
warfare
his
trouble
on
the
somme
was
that
the
enemy
did
not
permit
open
warfare
but
made
a
siege
of
it
with
defensive
lines
all
the
way
back
to
bapaume
and
every
hillock
a
fortress
and
every
wood
a
we
were
always
preparing
for
a
for
cavalry
pursuit
and
the
cavalry
were
always
being
massed
behind
the
lines
and
then
turned
back
again
after
futile
waiting
encumbering
the
roads
the
bloodbath
of
the
somme
as
the
germans
called
it
was
ours
as
well
as
theirs
and
scores
of
times
when
i
saw
the
dead
bodies
of
our
men
lying
strewn
over
those
dreadful
fields
after
desperate
and
in
the
end
successful
attacks
through
the
woods
of
death
mametz
wood
delville
wood
trones
wood
bernafay
wood
high
wood
and
over
the
pozieres
ridge
to
courcellette
and
martinpuich
i
thought
of
rawlinson
in
his
chateau
in
querrieux
scheming
out
the
battles
and
ordering
up
new
masses
of
troops
to
the
great
assault
over
the
bodies
of
their
dead
well
it
is
not
for
generals
to
sit
down
with
their
heads
in
their
hands
bemoaning
slaughter
or
to
shed
tears
over
their
maps
when
directing
battle
it
is
their
job
to
be
cheerful
to
harden
their
hearts
against
the
casualty
lists
to
keep
out
of
the
unless
their
presence
is
strictly
necessary
but
it
is
inevitable
that
the
men
who
risk
death
daily
the
who
carry
out
the
plans
of
the
high
command
and
see
no
sense
in
them
should
be
savage
in
their
irony
when
they
pass
a
peaceful
house
where
their
doom
is
being
planned
and
when
they
see
an
army
general
taking
a
stroll
in
buttercup
fields
with
a
jaunty
young
slashing
the
flowers
with
his
cane
and
telling
the
latest
joke
from
london
to
his
laughing
chief
as
onlookers
of
sacrifice
some
of
us
i
for
one
adopted
the
point
of
view
of
the
men
who
were
to
die
finding
some
reason
in
their
hatred
of
the
staffs
though
they
were
doing
their
job
with
a
sense
of
duty
and
with
as
much
intelligence
as
god
had
given
them
sir
henry
rawlinson
was
one
of
our
best
generals
as
may
be
seen
by
the
ribbons
on
his
breast
and
in
the
last
phase
commanded
a
real
army
of
pursuit
which
had
the
enemy
on
the
run
and
broke
through
to
victory
it
was
in
that
last
phase
of
open
warfare
that
rawlinson
showed
his
qualities
of
generalship
and
once
again
that
driving
purpose
which
was
his
in
the
somme
battles
but
achieved
only
by
prodigious
cost
of
life
xix
of
general
allenby
commanding
the
third
army
before
he
was
succeeded
by
sir
julian
byng
and
went
to
his
triumph
in
palestine
i
knew
very
little
except
by
hearsay
he
went
by
the
name
of
the
bull
because
of
his
burly
size
and
deep
voice
the
costly
fighting
that
followed
the
battle
of
arras
on
april
along
the
glacis
of
the
scarpe
did
not
reveal
high
generalship
there
were
many
young
officers
and
some
divisional
generals
who
complained
bitterly
of
attacks
ordered
without
sufficient
forethought
and
the
stream
of
casualties
which
poured
back
day
by
day
with
tales
of
tragic
happenings
did
not
inspire
one
with
a
sense
of
some
high
purpose
behind
it
all
or
some
presiding
genius
general
byng
bungo
byng
as
he
was
called
by
his
troops
won
the
admiration
of
the
canadian
corps
which
he
commanded
and
afterward
in
the
cambrai
advance
of
november
he
showed
daring
of
conception
and
gained
the
first
striking
surprise
in
the
war
by
novel
methods
of
attack
spoiled
by
the
quick
of
the
enemy
under
von
marwitz
and
our
withdrawal
from
bourlon
wood
masnieres
and
marcoing
and
other
places
after
desperate
fighting
his
chief
of
staff
louis
vaughan
was
a
charming
man
with
a
scientific
outlook
on
the
problems
of
war
and
so
kind
in
his
expression
and
character
that
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
could
devise
methods
of
killing
germans
in
a
wholesale
way
he
was
like
an
oxford
professor
of
history
discoursing
on
the
marlborough
wars
though
when
i
saw
him
many
times
outside
the
third
army
headquarters
in
a
railway
carriage
somewhere
near
villers
carbonnel
on
the
somme
battlefields
he
was
explaining
his
preparations
and
strategy
for
actions
to
be
fought
next
day
which
would
be
of
bloody
consequence
to
our
men
and
the
enemy
general
birdwood
commanding
the
australian
corps
and
afterward
the
fifth
army
in
succession
to
general
gough
was
always
known
as
birdie
by
high
and
low
and
this
dapper
man
so
neat
so
bright
so
brisk
had
a
human
touch
with
him
which
won
him
the
affection
of
all
his
troops
hunter
weston
of
the
corps
was
another
man
of
character
in
high
command
he
spoke
of
himself
in
the
house
of
commons
one
day
as
a
plain
blunt
soldier
and
the
army
roared
with
laughter
from
end
to
end
there
was
nothing
plain
or
blunt
about
him
he
was
a
man
of
airy
imagination
and
a
wide
range
of
knowledge
and
theories
on
life
and
war
which
he
put
forward
with
dramatic
eloquence
it
was
of
hunter
weston
that
the
story
was
told
about
the
drunken
soldier
put
onto
a
stretcher
and
covered
with
a
blanket
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
when
the
army
commander
made
a
visit
to
the
lines
what
this
said
the
general
casualty
sir
said
the
quaking
platoon
commander
not
bad
i
hope
dead
sir
said
the
subaltern
he
meant
dead
drunk
the
general
drew
himself
up
and
said
in
his
dramatic
way
the
army
commander
salutes
the
honored
dead
and
the
drunken
private
put
his
head
from
under
the
blanket
and
asked
what
the
old
geezer
of
that
story
may
have
been
invented
in
a
battalion
mess
but
it
went
through
the
army
affixed
to
the
name
of
hunter
weston
and
seemed
to
fit
him
the
corps
was
on
the
left
in
the
first
attack
on
the
somme
when
many
of
our
divisions
were
cut
to
pieces
in
the
attempt
to
break
the
german
line
at
gommecourt
it
was
a
ghastly
tragedy
which
spoiled
the
success
on
the
right
at
fricourt
and
montauban
but
hunter
weston
was
not
degomme
as
the
french
would
say
and
continued
to
air
his
theories
on
life
and
warfare
until
the
day
of
victory
when
once
again
we
had
muddled
through
not
by
great
generalship
but
by
the
courage
of
common
men
among
the
divisional
generals
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
i
met
most
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
were
general
hull
of
the
london
division
general
hickey
of
the
irish
division
general
harper
of
the
highland
division
general
nugent
of
the
ulster
division
and
general
pinnie
of
the
bantams
division
afterward
of
the
general
hull
was
a
handsome
man
and
i
should
say
an
able
general
ruthless
his
men
said
but
this
was
a
war
of
ruthlessness
because
life
was
cheap
bitter
he
was
at
times
because
he
had
to
order
his
men
to
do
things
which
he
knew
were
folly
i
remember
sitting
on
the
of
his
bedroom
in
an
old
house
of
arras
while
he
gave
me
an
account
of
the
battle
in
the
dark
in
which
the
londoners
and
other
english
troops
lost
their
direction
and
found
themselves
at
dawn
with
the
enemy
behind
them
general
hull
made
no
secret
of
the
tragedy
or
the
stupidity
on
another
day
i
met
him
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
peronne
before
march
when
he
was
commanding
the
irish
division
in
the
absence
of
general
hickey
who
was
ill
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
the
belief
in
a
great
german
offensive
and
gave
many
reasons
for
thinking
it
was
all
a
few
days
later
the
enemy
had
rolled
over
his
lines
out
of
thirteen
generals
i
met
at
that
time
there
were
only
three
who
believed
that
the
enemy
would
make
his
great
assault
in
a
final
effort
to
gain
decisive
victory
though
our
intelligence
had
amassed
innumerable
proofs
and
were
utterly
convinced
of
the
approaching
menace
they
will
never
risk
it
said
general
gorringe
of
the
london
division
our
lines
are
too
strong
we
should
mow
them
i
was
standing
with
him
on
a
wagon
watching
the
sports
of
the
london
men
we
could
see
the
german
lines
south
of
very
quiet
over
there
without
any
sign
of
coming
trouble
a
few
days
later
the
place
where
we
were
standing
was
under
waves
of
german
i
liked
the
love
of
general
hickey
for
his
irish
division
an
irishman
himself
with
a
touch
of
the
old
irish
soldier
as
drawn
by
charles
lever
proud
of
his
boys
he
was
always
pleased
to
see
me
because
he
knew
i
had
a
warm
spot
in
my
heart
for
the
irish
troops
he
had
a
good
story
to
tell
every
time
and
passed
me
on
to
the
boys
to
get
at
the
heart
of
them
it
was
long
before
he
lost
hope
of
keeping
the
division
together
though
it
was
hard
to
get
recruits
and
losses
were
high
at
guillemont
and
ginchy
for
the
first
time
he
lost
heart
and
was
very
sad
when
the
division
was
cut
to
pieces
in
a
flanders
battle
it
lost
men
and
officers
before
the
battle
began
they
were
shelled
to
death
in
the
trenches
and
men
and
officers
more
during
the
progress
of
the
battle
it
was
murderous
and
ghastly
general
harper
of
the
highland
division
afterward
commanding
the
corps
had
the
respect
of
his
troops
though
they
called
him
uncle
because
of
his
shock
of
white
hair
the
highland
division
under
his
command
fought
many
battles
and
gained
great
honor
even
from
the
enemy
who
feared
them
and
called
the
kilted
men
the
ladies
from
it
was
to
them
the
germans
sent
their
message
in
a
small
balloon
during
the
retreat
from
the
somme
poor
old
still
sticking
it
uncle
harper
invited
me
to
lunch
in
his
mess
and
was
ironical
with
war
correspondents
and
censors
and
the
british
public
and
new
theories
of
training
and
many
things
in
which
he
saw
no
sense
there
was
a
smoldering
passion
in
him
which
glowed
in
his
dark
eyes
he
was
against
which
took
the
field
against
for
a
time
no
man
in
this
war
he
said
with
a
sweeping
assertion
has
ever
been
killed
by
the
bayonet
unless
he
had
his
hands
up
and
broadly
speaking
i
think
he
was
right
in
spite
of
the
director
of
training
who
was
extremely
annoyed
with
me
when
i
quoted
this
authority
xx
i
met
many
other
generals
who
were
men
of
ability
energy
high
sense
of
duty
and
strong
personality
i
found
them
intellectually
with
few
exceptions
narrowly
molded
to
the
same
type
strangely
limited
in
their
range
of
ideas
and
qualities
of
character
one
has
to
leave
many
gaps
in
one
conversation
with
generals
said
a
friend
of
mine
after
lunching
with
an
army
commander
that
was
true
one
had
to
talk
to
them
on
the
lines
of
leading
articles
in
the
morning
post
their
patriotism
their
knowledge
of
human
nature
their
idealism
and
their
imagination
were
restricted
to
the
traditional
views
of
english
country
gentlemen
of
the
tory
school
anything
outside
that
range
of
thought
was
to
them
heresy
treason
or
sentiment
what
mainly
was
wrong
with
our
generalship
was
the
system
which
put
the
high
command
into
the
hands
of
a
group
of
men
belonging
to
the
old
school
of
war
unable
by
reason
of
their
age
and
traditions
to
get
away
from
rigid
methods
and
to
become
elastic
in
face
of
new
conditions
our
staff
college
had
been
hopelessly
inefficient
in
its
system
of
training
if
i
am
justified
in
forming
such
an
opinion
from
specimens
produced
by
it
who
had
the
brains
of
canaries
and
the
manners
of
potsdam
there
was
also
a
close
corporation
among
the
officers
of
the
regular
army
so
that
they
took
the
lion
share
of
staff
appointments
thus
keeping
out
brilliant
young
men
of
the
new
armies
whose
to
say
the
least
of
it
was
on
a
higher
level
than
that
of
the
sandhurst
standard
here
and
there
where
the
unprofessional
soldier
obtained
a
chance
of
high
command
or
staff
authority
he
proved
the
value
of
the
business
mind
applied
to
war
and
this
was
seen
very
clearly
blindingly
in
the
able
generalship
of
the
australian
corps
in
which
most
of
the
commanders
like
generals
hobbs
monash
and
others
were
men
in
civil
life
before
the
war
the
same
thing
was
observed
in
the
canadian
corps
general
currie
the
corps
commander
having
been
an
estate
agent
and
many
of
his
high
officers
having
had
no
military
training
of
any
scientific
importance
before
they
handled
their
own
men
in
france
and
flanders
xxi
as
there
are
exceptions
to
every
rule
so
harsh
criticism
must
be
modified
in
favor
of
the
generalship
and
organization
of
the
second
rare
efficiency
under
the
restrictions
and
authority
of
the
general
staff
i
often
used
to
wonder
what
qualities
belonged
to
sir
herbert
plumer
the
army
commander
in
appearance
he
was
almost
a
caricature
of
an
british
general
with
his
ruddy
face
with
white
hair
and
a
fierce
little
white
mustache
and
blue
watery
eyes
and
a
little
and
short
legs
he
puffed
and
panted
when
he
walked
and
after
two
minutes
in
his
company
cyril
maude
would
have
played
him
to
perfection
the
of
his
army
was
as
good
in
detail
as
any
machinery
of
war
may
be
and
the
tactical
direction
of
the
second
army
battles
was
not
slipshod
nor
haphazard
as
so
many
others
but
prepared
with
minute
attention
to
detail
and
after
thoughtful
planning
of
the
general
scheme
the
battle
of
wytschaete
and
messines
was
a
model
in
organization
and
method
and
worked
in
its
frightful
destructiveness
like
the
clockwork
of
a
death
machine
even
the
battles
of
flanders
in
the
autumn
of
ghastly
as
they
were
in
the
losses
of
our
men
in
the
state
of
the
ground
through
which
they
had
to
fight
and
in
futile
results
were
well
organized
by
the
second
army
headquarters
compared
with
the
abominable
mismanagement
of
other
troops
the
contrast
being
visible
to
every
battalion
officer
and
even
to
the
private
soldier
how
much
share
of
this
was
due
to
sir
herbert
plumer
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
tell
though
it
is
fair
to
give
him
credit
for
soundness
of
judgment
in
general
ideas
and
in
the
choice
of
men
he
had
for
his
chief
of
staff
sir
john
harington
and
beyond
all
doubt
this
general
was
the
organizing
brain
of
to
second
army
though
with
punctilious
chivalry
he
gave
always
the
credit
of
all
his
work
to
the
army
commander
a
thin
nervous
highly
strung
man
with
extreme
simplicity
of
manner
and
clarity
of
intelligence
he
impressed
me
as
a
brain
of
the
highest
temper
and
quality
in
his
memory
for
detail
was
like
a
system
yet
his
mind
was
not
clogged
with
detail
but
saw
the
wood
as
well
as
the
trees
and
the
whole
broad
sweep
of
the
problem
which
confronted
him
there
was
something
fascinating
as
well
as
terrible
in
his
exposition
of
a
battle
that
he
was
planning
for
the
first
time
in
his
presence
and
over
his
maps
i
saw
that
after
all
there
was
such
a
thing
as
the
science
of
war
and
that
it
was
not
always
a
fetish
of
elementary
ideas
raised
to
the
nth
degree
of
pomposity
as
i
had
been
led
to
believe
by
contact
with
other
generals
and
here
at
least
was
a
man
who
dealt
with
it
as
a
scientific
business
according
to
the
methods
of
science
calculating
the
weight
and
effect
of
the
strength
of
the
enemy
defenses
and
the
psychology
of
german
generalship
and
of
german
units
the
pressure
which
could
be
put
on
british
troops
before
the
of
courage
the
relative
or
cumulative
effects
of
mines
heavy
and
light
artillery
tanks
the
disposition
of
german
guns
and
the
probability
of
their
movement
in
this
direction
or
that
the
amount
of
their
wastage
under
our
work
the
advantages
of
attacks
in
depth
one
body
of
troops
another
in
an
advance
to
further
objectives
the
of
transport
the
supply
of
food
and
water
and
ammunition
the
comfort
of
troops
before
action
and
a
thousand
other
factors
of
success
before
every
battle
fought
by
the
second
army
and
of
the
eve
of
it
sir
john
harington
sent
for
the
war
correspondents
and
devoted
an
hour
or
more
to
a
detailed
explanation
of
his
plans
he
put
down
all
his
cards
on
the
table
with
perfect
candor
hiding
nothing
neither
minimizing
nor
exaggerating
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
attack
pointing
out
the
tactical
obstacles
which
must
be
overcome
before
any
chance
of
success
and
exposing
the
general
strategy
in
the
simplest
and
clearest
speech
i
used
to
study
him
at
those
times
and
marveled
at
him
after
intense
and
prolonged
work
at
all
this
detail
involving
the
lives
of
thousands
of
men
he
was
highly
wrought
with
every
nerve
in
his
body
and
brain
at
full
tension
but
he
was
never
flurried
never
irritable
never
depressed
or
elated
by
false
pessimism
or
false
optimism
he
was
a
chemist
explaining
the
factors
of
a
great
experiment
of
which
the
result
was
still
uncertain
he
could
only
hope
for
certain
results
after
careful
analysis
and
synthesis
yet
he
was
not
dehumanized
he
laughed
sometimes
at
surprises
he
had
caused
the
enemy
or
was
likely
to
cause
them
surprises
which
would
lead
to
a
massacre
of
their
men
he
warmed
to
the
glory
of
the
courage
of
the
troops
who
were
carrying
out
his
plans
it
depends
on
these
fellows
he
would
say
i
am
setting
them
a
difficult
job
if
they
can
do
it
as
i
hope
and
believe
it
will
be
a
fine
achievement
they
have
been
very
much
tried
poor
fellows
but
their
spirit
is
still
high
as
i
know
from
their
commanding
one
of
his
ambitions
was
to
break
down
the
prejudice
between
the
fighting
units
and
the
staff
we
want
them
to
know
that
we
are
all
working
together
for
the
same
purpose
and
with
the
same
zeal
they
can
not
do
without
us
as
we
can
not
do
without
them
and
i
want
them
to
feel
that
the
work
done
here
is
to
help
them
to
do
theirs
more
easily
with
lighter
losses
in
better
physical
conditions
with
organization
behind
them
at
every
many
times
the
second
army
would
not
order
an
attack
or
decide
the
time
of
it
before
consulting
the
divisional
generals
and
brigadiers
and
obtaining
their
consensus
of
opinion
the
officers
and
men
in
the
second
army
did
actually
come
to
acknowledge
the
value
of
the
behind
them
and
felt
a
confidence
in
its
devotion
to
their
interests
which
was
rare
on
the
western
front
at
the
end
of
one
of
his
expositions
sir
john
harington
would
rise
and
gather
up
his
maps
and
papers
and
say
well
there
you
are
gentlemen
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
about
the
plans
for
battle
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
will
be
able
to
see
the
result
of
all
our
work
and
tell
me
things
i
do
not
those
conferences
took
place
in
the
second
army
headquarters
on
cassel
hill
in
a
big
building
which
was
a
casino
before
the
war
with
a
view
across
flanders
so
that
one
could
see
in
the
distance
the
whole
sweep
of
the
ypres
salient
and
southward
the
country
below
notre
dame
de
lorette
with
merville
and
hazebrouck
in
the
foreground
often
we
assembled
in
a
glass
house
furnished
with
trestle
tables
on
which
maps
were
spread
and
thinking
back
to
these
scenes
i
remember
now
as
i
write
the
noise
of
rain
beating
on
that
glass
roof
and
the
clammy
touch
of
fog
on
the
stealing
through
the
cracks
and
creeping
into
the
room
the
meteorologist
of
the
second
army
was
often
a
gloomy
prophet
and
his
prophecies
were
right
how
it
rained
on
nights
when
hundreds
of
thousands
of
british
soldiers
were
waiting
in
their
trenches
to
attack
in
a
murky
dawn
we
said
good
night
to
general
harington
each
one
of
us
i
think
excited
by
the
thought
of
the
drama
of
human
life
and
death
which
we
had
heard
in
advance
in
that
glass
house
on
the
hill
to
be
played
out
by
flesh
and
blood
before
many
hours
had
passed
a
kind
of
sickness
took
possession
of
my
soul
when
i
stumbled
down
the
rock
path
from
those
headquarters
in
pitch
darkness
over
slabs
of
stones
designed
by
a
casino
architect
to
break
one
neck
with
the
rain
dribbling
down
one
collar
and
far
away
watery
lights
in
the
sky
of
and
afire
and
the
noise
of
artillery
thudding
in
dull
crumbling
shocks
we
were
starting
early
to
see
the
opening
of
the
battle
and
its
backwash
there
would
be
more
streams
of
bloody
muddy
men
more
crowds
of
miserable
prisoners
more
dead
bodies
lying
in
the
muck
of
captured
ground
more
shells
plunging
into
the
wet
earth
and
throwing
up
columns
of
smoke
and
mud
more
dead
horses
disemboweled
and
another
victory
at
fearful
cost
over
one
of
the
flanders
ridges
curses
and
prayers
surged
up
in
my
heart
how
long
was
this
to
go
on
this
massacre
of
youth
this
agony
of
men
was
there
no
sanity
left
in
the
world
that
could
settle
the
argument
by
other
means
than
this
when
we
had
taken
that
ridge
there
would
be
another
to
take
and
another
and
what
then
had
we
such
endless
reserves
of
men
that
we
could
go
on
gaining
ground
at
such
a
price
was
it
to
be
extermination
on
both
sides
the
end
of
civilization
itself
general
harington
had
said
the
enemy
is
still
very
strong
he
has
plenty
of
reserves
on
hand
and
he
is
fighting
hard
it
wo
be
a
as
an
onlooker
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
full
measure
of
all
this
tragic
drama
the
vastness
and
the
duration
of
its
horror
appalled
me
i
went
to
my
billet
in
an
old
monastery
and
sat
there
in
the
darkness
my
window
glimmering
with
the
faint
glow
of
distant
and
said
o
god
give
us
victory
if
that
may
help
us
to
the
then
to
bed
without
undressing
there
was
an
early
start
before
the
dawn
major
lytton
would
be
with
me
he
had
a
gallant
look
along
the
duckboards
or
montague
montague
who
liked
to
gain
a
far
objective
whatever
the
risk
and
gave
one
a
little
courage
by
his
apparent
fearlessness
i
had
no
courage
on
those
early
mornings
of
battle
all
that
i
had
which
was
little
oozed
out
of
me
when
we
came
to
the
first
dead
horses
and
the
first
dead
men
and
passed
the
tumult
of
our
guns
firing
out
of
the
mud
and
heard
the
scream
of
shells
i
hated
it
all
with
a
cold
hatred
and
i
went
on
hating
it
for
years
that
seem
a
lifetime
i
was
not
alone
in
that
hatred
and
other
men
had
greater
cause
though
it
was
for
their
sake
that
i
suffered
most
as
an
observer
of
their
drama
of
death
as
observers
we
saw
most
of
the
grisly
game
part
two
the
school
of
courage
early
days
with
the
new
army
i
by
the
time
stationary
warfare
had
been
established
on
the
western
front
in
trench
lines
from
the
sea
to
switzerland
the
british
regular
army
had
withered
away
that
was
after
the
retreat
from
mons
the
victory
of
the
marne
the
early
battles
round
ypres
and
the
slaughter
at
neuve
chapelle
the
old
contemptibles
were
an
army
of
ghosts
whose
dead
clay
was
under
earth
in
many
fields
of
france
but
whose
spirit
still
carried
on
as
an
heroic
tradition
to
those
who
came
after
them
into
those
same
fields
to
the
same
fate
the
only
survivors
were
regular
officers
taken
out
of
the
to
form
the
staffs
of
new
divisions
and
to
train
the
army
of
volunteers
now
being
raised
at
home
and
men
who
were
recovering
from
wounds
or
serving
behind
the
lines
those
and
officers
who
were
the
best
schoolmasters
of
the
new
boys
the
best
friends
and
guides
of
the
new
officers
stubborn
in
their
courage
hard
and
ruthless
in
their
discipline
according
to
their
own
traditions
until
they
too
fell
in
the
shambles
it
was
in
march
of
that
a
in
the
trenches
said
to
me
i
am
one
out
of
regular
officers
still
serving
with
their
battalions
that
is
to
say
there
are
of
us
left
in
the
out
of
that
little
regular
army
of
ours
had
justified
its
pride
in
a
long
history
of
fighting
courage
it
had
helped
to
save
england
and
france
by
its
own
death
those
boys
of
ours
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
first
august
of
the
war
landing
at
boulogne
and
marching
as
though
to
a
festival
toward
the
enemy
with
french
girls
kissing
them
and
loading
them
with
fruit
and
flowers
had
proved
the
quality
of
their
spirit
and
training
as
riflemen
they
had
stupefied
the
enemy
brought
to
a
sudden
check
by
forces
they
had
despised
they
held
their
fire
until
the
german
ranks
were
within
eight
hundred
yards
of
them
and
then
mowed
them
down
as
though
by
fire
before
we
had
except
as
rare
specimens
here
and
there
our
horse
artillery
was
beyond
any
doubt
the
best
in
the
world
at
that
time
even
before
peace
came
german
generals
paid
ungrudging
tributes
to
the
efficiency
of
our
regular
army
writing
down
in
their
histories
of
war
that
this
was
the
model
of
all
armies
the
most
perfectly
trained
it
was
spent
by
the
spring
of
its
memory
remains
as
the
last
epic
of
those
professional
soldiers
who
through
centuries
of
english
history
took
the
king
shilling
and
fought
when
they
were
told
to
fight
and
left
their
bones
in
far
places
of
the
world
and
in
many
fields
in
europe
and
won
for
the
british
soldier
universal
fame
as
a
terrible
warrior
there
will
never
be
a
regular
army
like
that
modern
warfare
has
opened
the
arena
to
the
multitude
they
may
no
longer
sit
in
the
coliseum
watching
the
paid
gladiators
if
there
be
war
they
must
take
their
share
of
its
sacrifice
they
must
be
victims
as
well
as
victors
they
must
pay
for
the
luxury
of
conquest
hatred
and
revenge
by
their
own
bodies
and
for
their
safety
against
aggression
by
national
service
after
the
first
quick
phases
of
the
war
this
need
of
national
soldiers
to
replace
the
professional
forces
became
clear
to
the
military
leaders
the
territorials
who
had
been
raised
for
home
defense
were
sent
out
to
fill
up
the
gaps
and
their
elementary
training
was
shown
to
be
good
enough
as
a
beginning
in
the
the
courage
of
those
territorial
divisions
who
came
out
first
to
france
was
quickly
proved
and
soon
put
to
the
supreme
test
in
which
they
did
not
fail
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
these
men
who
had
made
a
game
of
soldiering
in
days
of
peace
yet
a
serious
game
to
which
they
had
devoted
much
of
their
spare
time
after
were
splendid
beyond
all
words
of
praise
and
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
the
territorial
officers
men
of
good
standing
in
their
counties
men
of
brain
and
business
training
were
handicapped
by
lack
of
promotion
and
treated
with
contempt
by
the
high
command
who
gave
preference
always
to
the
regular
officers
in
every
staff
appointment
this
was
natural
and
inevitable
in
armies
controlled
by
the
old
regular
school
of
service
and
tradition
as
a
close
corporation
in
command
of
the
machine
it
was
not
within
their
nature
or
philosophy
to
make
way
for
the
new
type
the
staff
college
was
jealous
of
its
own
sandhurst
and
woolwich
were
still
the
only
schools
of
soldiering
recognized
as
giving
the
right
tone
to
officers
and
gentlemen
fit
for
high
appointment
the
cavalry
above
all
held
the
power
of
supreme
command
in
a
war
of
machines
and
chemistry
and
national
psychology
i
should
hate
to
attack
the
regular
officer
his
caste
belonged
to
the
best
of
our
blood
he
was
the
heir
to
fine
old
traditions
of
courage
and
leadership
in
battle
he
was
a
gentleman
whose
touch
of
arrogance
was
subject
to
a
rigid
code
of
honor
which
made
him
look
to
the
comfort
of
his
men
first
to
the
health
of
his
horse
second
to
his
own
physical
needs
last
he
had
the
stern
sense
of
justice
of
a
roman
centurian
and
his
men
knew
that
though
he
would
not
spare
them
punishment
if
guilty
he
would
give
them
always
a
fair
hearing
with
a
point
in
their
favor
if
possible
it
was
in
their
code
to
take
the
greatest
risk
in
time
of
danger
to
be
scornful
of
death
in
the
face
of
their
men
whatever
secret
fear
they
had
and
to
be
proud
and
jealous
of
the
honor
of
the
regiment
in
action
men
found
them
good
to
follow
better
than
some
of
the
young
officers
of
the
new
army
who
had
not
the
same
traditional
pride
nor
the
same
instinct
for
command
nor
the
same
consideration
for
their
men
though
more
and
human
in
sympathy
so
i
salute
in
spirit
those
battalion
officers
of
the
old
army
who
fulfilled
their
heritage
until
it
was
overwhelmed
by
new
forces
and
i
find
extenuating
circumstances
even
in
remembrance
of
the
high
stupidities
the
narrow
imagination
the
deep
impregnable
intolerant
ignorance
of
staff
college
men
who
with
their
red
tape
and
their
general
orders
were
the
inquisitors
and
torturers
of
the
new
armies
tout
comprendre
tout
pardonner
they
were
molded
in
an
old
system
and
could
not
change
their
cliche
ii
the
new
army
was
called
into
being
by
lord
kitchener
and
his
advisers
who
adopted
modern
advertising
methods
to
stir
the
sluggish
imagination
of
the
masses
so
that
every
wall
in
london
and
great
cities
every
fence
in
rural
places
was
placarded
with
what
did
you
do
in
the
great
war
daddy
what
will
your
best
girl
say
if
you
not
in
khaki
those
were
vulgar
appeals
which
no
doubt
stirred
many
simple
souls
and
so
were
good
enough
it
would
have
been
better
to
let
the
people
know
more
of
the
truth
of
what
was
happening
in
france
and
flanders
the
truth
of
tragedy
instead
of
carefully
camouflaged
communiques
hiding
the
losses
ignoring
the
deeds
of
famous
regiments
veiling
all
the
drama
of
that
early
fighting
by
a
deliberate
screen
of
mystery
though
all
was
known
to
the
enemy
it
was
fear
of
their
own
people
not
of
the
enemy
which
guided
the
rules
of
censorship
then
and
later
for
some
little
time
the
british
people
did
not
understand
what
was
happening
how
could
they
know
it
appeared
that
all
was
going
well
then
why
worry
soon
there
would
be
the
of
peace
and
the
boys
would
come
marching
home
again
as
in
earlier
wars
it
was
only
very
slowly
because
of
the
conspiracy
of
silence
that
there
crept
into
the
consciousness
of
our
people
the
dim
realization
of
a
desperate
struggle
ahead
in
which
all
their
young
manhood
would
be
needed
to
save
france
and
belgium
and
dear
god
england
herself
it
was
as
that
thought
touched
one
mind
and
another
that
the
recruiting
offices
were
crowded
with
young
men
some
of
them
offered
their
bodies
because
of
the
promise
of
a
great
adventure
and
life
had
been
rather
dull
in
office
and
factory
and
on
the
farm
something
stirred
in
their
blood
an
old
call
to
youth
some
instinct
of
a
primitive
savage
kind
for
life
fighting
killing
the
comradeship
of
hunters
violent
emotions
the
chance
of
death
surged
up
into
the
brains
of
quiet
boys
clerks
mechanics
miners
factory
hands
it
was
the
call
of
the
wild
the
of
the
mind
to
the
old
barbarities
of
the
world
dawn
which
is
in
the
embryo
of
modern
man
the
shock
of
anger
at
frightful
tales
from
belgium
little
children
with
their
hands
cut
off
no
evidence
for
that
one
women
foully
outraged
civilians
shot
in
cold
blood
sent
many
men
at
a
quick
pace
to
the
recruiting
agents
others
were
sent
there
by
the
taunt
of
a
girl
or
the
sneer
of
a
comrade
in
khaki
or
the
straight
steady
look
in
the
eyes
of
a
father
who
said
what
about
it
dick
the
old
country
is
up
against
it
was
that
last
thought
which
worked
in
the
brain
of
england
manhood
that
was
his
real
call
which
whispered
to
men
at
the
plow
quiet
ruminating
lads
the
peasant
type
the
yeoman
and
excited
undergraduates
in
their
rooms
at
oxford
and
cambridge
and
the
masters
of
public
schools
and
all
manner
of
young
men
and
some
as
i
know
old
in
years
but
young
in
heart
the
old
country
is
in
danger
the
shadow
of
a
menace
was
creeping
over
some
little
patch
of
england
or
of
scotland
i
best
be
going
said
the
village
boy
et
decorum
est
said
the
undergraduate
i
hate
the
idea
but
it
got
to
be
done
said
the
city
bred
man
so
they
disappeared
from
their
familiar
haunts
more
and
more
of
them
as
the
months
passed
they
were
put
into
pigged
it
on
dirty
straw
in
dirty
barns
were
and
and
trained
by
hard
mouthed
sergeants
tyrants
and
bullies
in
a
good
cause
until
they
became
automata
at
the
word
of
command
lost
their
souls
as
it
seemed
in
that
of
military
training
and
cursed
their
fate
only
comradeship
helped
them
not
always
jolly
if
they
happened
to
be
a
class
above
their
fellows
a
moral
peg
above
and
men
of
filthy
habits
but
splendid
if
they
were
in
their
own
crowd
of
decent
companionable
lads
eleven
months
training
were
they
ever
going
to
the
front
the
war
would
be
over
before
they
landed
in
france
then
at
last
they
came
iii
it
was
not
until
july
of
that
the
announced
that
a
part
of
the
new
army
was
in
france
and
lifted
the
veil
from
the
secret
which
had
mystified
people
at
home
whose
boys
had
gone
from
them
but
who
could
not
get
a
word
of
their
doings
in
france
i
saw
the
first
of
the
kitchener
men
as
we
called
them
then
the
tramp
of
their
feet
in
a
steady
scrunch
scrunch
along
a
gritty
road
of
france
passed
the
window
of
my
billet
very
early
in
the
mornings
and
i
poked
my
head
out
to
get
another
glimpse
of
those
lads
marching
forward
to
the
for
as
long
as
history
lasts
the
imagination
of
our
people
will
strive
to
conjure
up
the
vision
of
those
boys
who
in
the
year
of
went
out
to
flanders
not
as
conscript
soldiers
but
as
volunteers
for
the
old
country
sake
to
take
their
risks
and
do
their
bit
in
the
world
bloodiest
war
i
saw
those
fellows
day
by
day
touched
hands
with
them
went
into
the
trenches
with
them
heard
their
first
tales
and
strolled
into
their
billets
when
they
had
shaken
down
for
a
night
or
two
within
sound
of
the
guns
history
will
envy
me
that
this
living
touch
with
the
men
who
beyond
any
doubt
did
in
their
simple
way
act
and
suffer
things
before
the
war
ended
which
revealed
new
wonders
of
human
courage
and
endurance
some
people
envied
me
then
those
people
at
home
to
whom
those
boys
belonged
and
who
in
country
towns
and
villages
and
suburban
houses
would
have
given
their
hearts
to
get
one
look
at
them
there
in
flanders
and
to
see
the
way
of
their
life
how
were
they
living
how
did
they
like
it
how
were
they
sleeping
what
did
the
regulars
think
of
the
new
army
oh
a
very
cheerful
lot
said
a
of
the
old
regular
type
who
was
having
a
quiet
pipe
over
a
paper
in
a
shed
at
the
back
of
some
farm
buildings
in
the
neighborhood
of
armentieres
which
had
been
plugged
by
two
hundred
german
shells
that
time
the
day
before
one
never
knew
when
the
fellows
on
the
other
side
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
empty
their
guns
that
way
they
had
already
killed
a
lot
of
civilians
thereabouts
but
the
others
stayed
on
not
a
bit
of
trouble
with
them
said
the
and
all
as
keen
as
when
they
grinned
into
a
recruiting
office
and
said
going
they
glad
to
be
out
some
of
for
ten
months
we
been
working
pretty
hard
had
to
but
they
were
willing
enough
now
you
could
find
a
better
battalion
though
some
more
famous
till
we
get
our
chance
you
he
pointed
with
the
stem
of
his
pipe
to
the
open
door
of
an
old
barn
where
a
party
of
his
men
were
resting
you
find
plenty
of
hot
heads
among
them
but
no
cold
feet
i
bet
on
the
men
were
lying
on
a
stone
floor
with
haversacks
for
pillows
or
squatting
writing
letters
home
from
a
far
corner
came
a
whistling
trio
harmonized
in
a
tune
which
for
some
reason
made
me
think
of
hayfields
in
southern
england
they
belonged
to
a
sussex
battalion
and
i
said
any
one
here
from
burpham
one
of
the
boys
sat
up
stared
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
yellow
hair
and
said
i
spoke
to
him
of
people
i
knew
there
and
he
was
astonished
that
i
should
know
them
distressed
also
in
a
queer
way
those
memories
of
a
sussex
village
seemed
to
break
down
some
of
the
hardness
in
which
he
had
cased
himself
i
could
see
a
frightful
homesickness
in
his
blue
eyes
i
seed
the
last
o
burpham
he
said
in
a
kind
of
whisper
so
that
the
other
men
should
not
hear
the
other
men
were
from
arundel
littlehampton
and
sussex
villages
they
were
of
saxon
breed
there
was
hardly
a
difference
between
them
and
some
german
prisoners
i
saw
as
they
were
with
fair
freckled
skins
they
told
me
they
were
glad
to
be
out
in
france
anything
was
better
than
training
at
home
i
like
germans
said
one
young
yokel
and
the
others
shouted
with
laughter
at
his
jest
perhaps
you
have
met
the
german
sergeants
i
said
i
met
said
the
sussex
boy
a
man
a
fool
to
be
a
soldier
eh
lads
they
agreed
heartily
though
they
were
all
volunteers
not
that
we
skeered
said
one
of
them
we
be
glad
when
the
fighting
speak
for
yourself
dick
meekcombe
and
do
forget
the
shells
last
there
was
another
roar
of
laughter
those
boys
of
the
south
saxons
were
full
of
spirit
in
their
yokel
way
they
were
disguising
their
real
thoughts
their
fear
of
being
afraid
their
hatred
of
the
thought
of
death
very
close
to
them
now
and
their
sense
of
strangeness
in
this
scene
on
the
edge
of
armentieres
a
world
away
from
their
old
life
the
colonel
sat
in
a
little
room
at
headquarters
a
bronzed
man
with
a
grizzled
mustache
and
eyes
with
a
fine
tenderness
in
his
smile
these
boys
of
mine
are
all
right
he
said
they
dear
fellows
and
ready
for
anything
of
course
it
was
anxious
work
at
first
but
my
c
o
are
a
lot
and
we
ready
for
he
spoke
of
the
recruiting
task
which
had
begun
the
business
eleven
months
ago
it
had
not
been
easy
among
all
those
scattered
villages
of
the
southern
county
he
had
gone
hunting
among
the
farms
and
cottages
for
likely
young
fellows
they
were
of
good
class
and
he
had
picked
the
lads
of
intelligence
and
weeded
out
the
others
they
came
from
a
good
stock
the
yeoman
breed
one
could
not
ask
for
better
stuff
the
officers
were
men
of
old
county
families
and
they
knew
their
men
that
was
a
great
thing
so
far
they
had
been
very
lucky
with
regard
to
casualties
though
it
was
unfortunate
that
a
company
commander
a
fine
fellow
who
had
been
a
schoolmaster
and
a
parson
should
have
been
picked
off
by
a
sniper
on
his
first
day
out
the
new
army
had
received
its
baptism
of
fire
though
nothing
very
fierce
as
yet
they
were
led
on
in
easy
stages
to
the
it
was
not
fair
to
plunge
them
straight
away
into
the
bad
places
but
the
test
of
steadiness
was
good
enough
on
a
dark
night
behind
the
reserve
trenches
when
the
reliefs
had
gone
up
and
there
was
a
bit
of
digging
to
do
in
the
open
quiet
there
boys
said
the
and
no
it
was
not
a
larky
kind
of
place
or
time
there
was
no
moon
and
a
light
drizzle
of
rain
fell
the
enemy
trenches
were
about
a
thousand
yards
away
and
their
guns
were
busy
in
the
night
so
that
the
shells
came
overhead
and
lads
who
had
heard
the
owls
hoot
in
english
woods
now
heard
stranger
crying
through
the
air
with
the
noise
of
rushing
wings
ending
in
a
thunderclap
and
my
old
mother
thinks
i
enjoying
myself
said
the
heir
to
a
seaside
thirsty
work
this
job
said
a
lad
who
used
to
skate
on
rollers
between
the
of
brighton
promenade
ca
see
much
in
those
shells
said
a
young
man
who
once
sold
blouses
in
an
emporium
of
a
south
coast
village
how
those
newspaper
chaps
do
try
to
frighten
us
he
put
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
sudden
jerk
what
that
wasps
a
number
of
insects
were
flying
overhead
with
a
queer
sibilant
noise
somewhere
in
the
darkness
there
was
a
steady
rattle
in
the
throat
of
a
beast
what
that
sergeant
my
child
keep
your
head
down
or
you
lose
hold
of
it
steady
there
do
get
jumpy
now
the
was
firing
too
high
to
do
any
serious
damage
it
was
probably
a
ricochet
from
a
broken
tree
which
made
one
of
the
boys
suddenly
drop
his
spade
and
fall
over
it
in
a
crumpled
way
get
up
charlie
said
the
comrade
next
to
him
and
then
in
a
scared
voice
oh
sergeant
that
all
right
said
the
we
getting
off
very
lightly
new
remember
what
i
been
telling
you
stretcher
this
they
were
very
steady
through
the
night
this
first
company
of
the
new
army
like
old
soldiers
sir
said
the
when
he
stood
chatting
with
the
colonel
after
breakfast
it
was
a
bit
of
bad
luck
though
not
very
bad
after
all
which
made
the
germans
shell
a
hamlet
into
which
i
went
just
as
some
of
the
new
army
were
marching
through
to
their
quarters
these
men
had
already
seen
what
shellfire
could
do
to
knock
the
beauty
out
of
old
houses
and
quiet
streets
they
had
gone
tramping
through
one
or
two
villages
to
which
the
enemy
guns
had
turned
their
attention
and
had
received
that
unforgetable
sensation
of
one
first
sight
of
roofless
cottages
and
great
gaps
in
garden
walls
and
tall
houses
which
have
tumbled
inside
themselves
but
now
they
saw
this
destruction
in
the
process
and
stood
very
still
listening
to
the
infernal
clatter
as
shells
burst
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
tumbling
down
huge
masses
of
masonry
and
plugging
holes
into
neat
cottages
and
tearing
great
gashes
out
of
walls
funny
business
said
one
of
the
boys
regular
drury
lane
melodrama
said
another
looks
as
if
some
of
us
would
be
home
in
time
for
lunch
was
another
comment
greeted
by
a
guffaw
along
the
line
they
tried
to
see
the
humor
of
it
though
there
was
a
false
note
in
some
of
the
jokes
but
it
was
the
heroic
falsity
of
boys
whose
pride
is
stronger
than
their
fear
that
inevitable
fear
which
chills
one
when
this
beastliness
is
being
done
not
a
single
casualty
said
one
of
the
officers
when
the
storm
of
shells
ended
with
a
few
last
concussions
and
a
rumble
of
falling
bricks
anything
wrong
with
our
luck
everything
was
all
right
with
the
luck
of
this
battalion
of
the
new
army
in
its
first
experience
of
war
on
the
first
night
in
the
no
damage
was
done
even
when
two
shells
came
into
one
of
their
billets
where
a
number
of
men
were
sleeping
after
a
hard
day
and
a
long
march
i
woke
up
pretty
quick
said
one
of
them
and
thought
the
house
had
fallen
in
i
was
out
of
it
before
the
second
came
then
i
laughed
i
a
heavy
sleeper
you
know
he
spoke
as
if
i
knew
his
weakness
my
mother
bought
me
an
last
birthday
you
be
down
for
breakfast
now
she
said
but
a
shell
is
better
as
a
i
did
stop
to
death
had
missed
him
by
a
foot
or
two
but
he
laughed
at
the
fluke
of
his
escape
k
men
had
not
forgotten
how
to
laugh
after
those
eleven
months
of
hard
training
and
they
found
a
joke
in
grisly
things
which
do
not
appeal
humorously
to
sensitive
men
any
room
for
us
there
asked
one
of
these
bronzed
fellows
as
he
marched
with
his
battalion
past
a
cemetery
where
the
fantastic
devices
of
french
graves
rose
above
the
churchyard
wall
oh
we
do
all
right
in
the
open
air
all
along
of
the
german
trenches
was
the
answer
he
had
from
the
lad
at
his
side
they
grinned
at
their
own
wit
iv
i
did
not
find
any
patriotism
among
the
rank
and
file
of
the
new
army
the
word
itself
meant
nothing
to
them
unlike
the
french
soldier
to
whom
patriotism
is
a
religion
and
who
has
the
name
of
france
on
his
lips
at
the
moment
of
peril
our
men
were
silent
about
the
reasons
for
their
coming
out
and
the
cause
for
which
they
risked
their
lives
it
was
not
for
imperial
power
any
illusion
to
the
empire
left
them
stone
cold
unless
they
confused
it
with
the
empire
music
hall
when
their
hearts
warmed
to
the
name
it
was
not
because
they
hated
germans
because
after
a
few
turns
in
the
trenches
many
of
them
had
a
for
the
poor
devils
over
the
way
and
to
the
end
of
the
war
treated
any
prisoners
they
took
after
the
killing
in
hot
blood
like
pet
monkeys
or
tame
bears
but
for
stringent
regulations
they
would
have
fraternized
with
the
enemy
at
the
slightest
excuse
and
did
so
in
the
winter
of
to
the
great
scandal
of
q
patriotism
asked
a
boy
of
me
in
ypres
and
there
was
hard
scorn
in
his
voice
yet
the
love
of
the
old
country
was
deep
down
in
the
roots
of
their
hearts
and
as
with
a
boy
who
came
from
the
village
where
i
lived
for
a
time
the
name
of
some
such
place
held
all
the
meaning
of
life
to
many
of
them
the
simple
minds
of
country
boys
clung
fast
to
that
went
back
in
waking
dreams
to
dwell
in
a
cottage
parlor
where
their
parents
sat
and
an
old
clock
ticked
and
a
dog
slept
with
its
head
on
its
paws
the
smell
of
the
fields
and
the
barns
the
friendship
of
familiar
trees
the
heritage
that
was
in
their
blood
from
old
yeoman
ancestry
touched
them
with
the
spirit
of
england
and
it
was
because
of
that
they
fought
the
london
lad
was
more
had
a
more
glib
way
of
expressing
his
convictions
but
even
he
hid
his
purpose
in
the
war
under
a
covering
of
irony
and
cynical
jests
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
old
city
and
the
pride
of
it
which
helped
him
to
suffer
and
in
his
daydreams
was
the
clanging
of
from
charing
cross
to
the
bank
the
lights
of
the
embankment
reflected
in
the
dark
river
the
back
yard
where
he
had
kept
his
bicycle
or
the
suburban
garden
where
he
had
watered
his
plants
london
good
old
london
his
heart
ached
for
it
sometimes
when
as
sentry
he
stared
across
the
parapet
to
the
barbed
wire
in
no
man
land
one
night
strolling
outside
my
own
billet
and
wandering
down
the
lane
a
way
i
heard
the
sound
of
singing
coming
from
a
big
brick
barn
on
the
roadside
i
stood
close
under
the
blank
wall
at
the
back
of
the
building
and
listened
the
men
were
singing
auld
lang
syne
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
concertina
and
a
they
were
taking
parts
and
the
old
tune
so
strange
to
hear
out
in
a
village
of
france
in
the
war
zone
sounded
very
well
with
harmonies
presently
the
concertina
changed
its
tune
and
the
men
of
the
new
army
sang
god
save
the
i
heard
it
sung
a
thousand
times
or
more
on
royal
festivals
and
tours
but
listening
to
it
then
from
that
dark
old
barn
in
flanders
where
a
number
of
k
men
lay
on
the
straw
a
night
or
two
away
from
the
ordeal
of
advanced
trenches
in
which
they
had
to
take
their
turn
i
heard
it
with
more
emotion
than
ever
before
in
that
anthem
chanted
by
these
boys
in
the
darkness
was
the
spirit
of
england
if
i
had
been
king
like
that
harry
who
wandered
round
the
camp
of
agincourt
where
his
men
lay
sleeping
i
should
have
been
glad
to
stand
and
listen
outside
that
barn
and
hear
those
words
send
him
victorious
happy
and
glorious
as
the
chief
of
the
british
tribes
the
fifth
george
received
his
tribute
from
those
warrior
boys
who
had
come
out
to
fight
for
the
flag
that
meant
to
them
some
old
village
on
the
sussex
downs
where
a
mother
and
a
sweetheart
waited
or
some
town
in
the
midlands
where
the
walls
were
placarded
with
posters
which
made
the
germans
gibe
or
old
london
where
the
went
clanging
down
the
strand
as
i
went
back
up
the
lane
a
dark
figure
loomed
out
and
i
heard
the
click
of
a
it
was
one
of
men
standing
sentry
outside
the
camp
who
goes
there
it
was
a
cockney
voice
pass
friends
all
yes
all
was
well
then
as
far
as
human
courage
and
the
spirit
of
a
splendid
youthfulness
counted
in
that
war
of
high
explosives
and
destructive
chemistry
the
fighting
in
front
of
these
lads
of
the
new
army
decided
the
fate
of
the
world
and
it
was
the
valor
of
those
young
soldiers
who
in
a
little
while
were
flung
into
and
killed
in
great
numbers
which
made
all
things
different
in
the
philosophy
of
modern
life
that
concertina
in
the
barn
was
playing
the
music
of
an
epic
which
will
make
those
who
sang
it
seem
like
heroes
of
mythology
to
the
future
race
which
will
read
of
this
in
europe
yet
it
was
a
cockney
perhaps
from
clapham
junction
or
peckham
rye
who
said
like
a
voice
of
fate
all
v
when
the
new
army
first
came
out
to
learn
their
lessons
in
the
trenches
in
the
long
days
before
open
warfare
the
enemy
had
the
best
of
it
in
every
way
in
gunpowder
and
in
supplies
of
ammunition
he
was
our
master
all
along
the
line
and
made
use
of
his
mastery
by
flinging
over
large
numbers
of
shells
of
all
sizes
and
types
which
caused
a
heavy
toll
in
casualties
to
us
while
our
gunners
were
strictly
limited
to
a
few
rounds
a
day
and
cursed
bitterly
because
they
could
not
answer
in
march
of
i
saw
the
first
howitzer
open
fire
we
called
this
monster
grandma
and
there
was
a
little
group
of
generals
on
the
scherpenberg
near
kemmel
to
see
the
effect
of
the
first
shell
its
target
was
on
the
lower
slope
of
the
wytschaete
ridge
where
some
trenches
were
to
be
attacked
for
reasons
only
known
by
our
generals
and
by
god
preliminary
to
the
attack
our
opened
fire
with
shrapnel
which
scattered
over
the
german
trenches
their
formidable
earthworks
with
deep
dugouts
like
the
glitter
of
confetti
and
had
no
more
effect
than
that
before
the
infantry
made
a
rush
for
the
enemy
line
and
were
mown
down
by
fire
the
germans
were
very
strong
in
and
we
were
very
weak
in
the
usual
way
of
those
early
days
the
first
shell
fired
by
our
monster
howitzer
was
heralded
by
a
low
reverberation
as
of
thunder
from
the
field
below
us
then
several
seconds
later
there
rose
from
the
wytschaete
ridge
a
tall
black
column
of
smoke
which
stood
steady
until
the
breeze
clawed
at
it
and
tore
it
to
tatters
some
shell
said
an
officer
now
we
ought
to
win
the
war
i
think
later
there
arrived
the
first
aunty
as
we
called
it
well
that
was
something
in
the
way
of
heavy
artillery
and
gradually
our
grew
and
grew
until
we
could
answer
back
and
give
more
than
came
to
us
but
meanwhile
the
new
army
had
to
stand
the
racket
as
the
old
army
had
done
being
strafed
by
harassing
fire
having
their
trenches
blown
in
and
their
billets
smashed
and
their
bodies
broken
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
within
range
of
german
guns
everywhere
the
enemy
was
on
high
ground
and
had
observation
of
our
position
from
the
westhook
ridge
and
the
pilkem
ridge
his
observers
watched
every
movement
of
our
men
round
ypres
and
along
the
main
road
to
hooge
signaling
back
to
their
guns
if
anybody
of
them
were
visible
from
the
wytschaete
ridge
as
we
called
it
and
messines
they
could
see
for
miles
across
our
territory
not
only
the
trenches
but
the
ways
up
to
the
trenches
and
the
villages
behind
them
and
the
roads
through
the
villages
they
looked
straight
into
kemmel
village
and
turned
their
guns
on
to
it
when
our
men
crouched
among
its
ruins
and
opened
the
graves
in
the
cemetery
and
lay
old
bones
bare
clear
and
vivid
to
them
were
the
red
roofs
of
dickebusch
village
and
the
gaunt
ribs
of
its
broken
houses
i
knew
a
boy
from
fleet
street
who
was
cobbler
there
in
a
room
between
the
ruins
those
germans
gazed
down
the
roads
to
vierstraat
and
vormizeele
and
watched
for
the
rising
of
white
dust
which
would
tell
them
when
men
were
marching
by
more
cannon
fodder
southward
they
saw
neuve
eglise
with
its
rag
of
a
tower
and
plug
street
wood
in
cheerful
mood
on
sunny
days
german
gunners
with
shells
to
spare
ranged
upon
separate
and
isolated
barns
until
they
became
bits
of
oddly
standing
brick
about
great
holes
they
shelled
the
roads
down
which
our
transport
wagons
went
at
night
and
the
communication
trenches
to
which
our
men
moved
up
to
the
front
lines
and
revealed
by
every
flash
and
dugouts
foolishly
frail
against
their
which
in
those
early
days
we
could
only
answer
by
a
few
they
made
fixed
targets
of
crossroads
and
points
our
men
were
bound
to
pass
so
that
to
our
men
those
places
became
sinister
with
remembered
horror
and
present
fear
dead
horse
corner
and
dead
cow
farm
and
the
farm
beyond
plug
street
dead
dog
farm
and
the
moated
grange
on
the
way
to
stinking
farm
and
suicide
corner
and
barn
out
by
ypres
all
the
fighting
youth
of
our
race
took
their
turn
in
those
places
searched
along
those
roads
lived
in
ditches
and
dugouts
there
under
constant
fire
in
wet
holes
along
the
yser
canal
by
ypres
young
officers
who
had
known
the
decencies
of
home
life
tried
to
camouflage
their
beastliness
by
giving
a
touch
of
decoration
to
the
clammy
walls
they
bought
kirchner
prints
of
little
ladies
too
lightly
clad
for
the
climate
of
flanders
and
pinned
them
up
as
a
reminder
of
the
dainty
feminine
side
of
life
which
here
was
banished
they
brought
broken
chairs
and
mirrors
from
the
ruins
of
ypres
and
said
it
quite
cozy
after
all
and
they
sat
there
chatting
as
in
james
street
clubs
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
with
the
same
courtesy
and
sense
of
humor
while
they
listened
to
noises
without
and
wondered
whether
it
would
be
or
or
in
the
middle
of
the
sentence
they
were
speaking
that
bits
of
steel
would
smash
through
that
mud
above
their
heads
and
tear
them
to
bits
and
make
a
mess
of
things
there
was
an
officer
of
the
coldstream
guards
who
sat
in
one
of
these
holes
like
many
others
a
nice
gentle
fellow
fond
of
music
a
fine
judge
of
wine
a
connoisseur
of
old
furniture
and
good
food
it
was
cruelty
to
put
such
a
man
into
a
hole
in
the
earth
like
the
of
hagenbeck
zoo
he
had
been
used
to
comfort
the
little
luxuries
of
court
life
there
on
the
he
refused
to
sink
into
the
squalor
he
put
on
pajamas
at
night
before
sleeping
in
his
bunk
silk
pajamas
and
while
waiting
for
his
breakfast
smoked
his
own
brand
of
cigarettes
until
one
morning
a
big
shell
blew
out
the
back
of
his
dugout
and
hurled
him
under
a
heap
of
earth
and
timber
he
crawled
out
cursing
loudly
with
a
nice
choice
of
language
and
then
lit
another
gold
tipped
cigarette
and
called
to
his
servant
for
breakfast
his
batman
was
a
fine
lad
brought
up
in
the
old
traditions
of
service
to
an
officer
of
the
guards
and
he
provided
excellent
little
meals
done
to
a
turn
until
something
else
happened
and
he
was
buried
alive
within
a
few
yards
of
his
master
whenever
i
went
to
the
and
i
went
there
many
times
when
still
and
always
hungry
high
velocities
came
searching
for
a
chance
meal
i
thought
of
my
friend
in
the
guards
and
of
other
men
i
knew
who
had
lived
there
in
the
worst
days
and
some
of
whom
had
died
there
they
hated
that
and
dreaded
it
but
they
jested
in
their
dugouts
and
there
was
the
laughter
of
men
who
hid
the
fear
in
their
hearts
and
were
game
until
some
bit
of
steel
plugged
them
with
a
gaping
wound
or
tore
their
flesh
to
tatters
vi
because
the
enemy
was
on
the
high
ground
and
our
men
were
in
the
low
ground
many
of
our
trenches
were
wet
and
waterlogged
even
in
summer
after
heavy
rain
in
winter
they
were
in
bogs
and
swamps
up
by
and
southward
this
side
of
gommecourt
and
in
many
other
evil
places
the
enemy
drained
his
water
into
our
ditches
when
he
could
with
the
cunning
and
the
science
of
his
way
of
war
and
that
made
our
men
savage
i
remember
going
to
the
line
this
side
of
fricourt
on
an
august
day
in
it
was
the
seventeenth
of
august
as
i
have
it
in
my
diary
and
the
episode
is
vivid
in
my
mind
because
i
saw
then
the
new
army
lads
learning
one
of
the
lessons
of
war
in
one
of
the
foulest
places
i
also
learned
the
sense
of
humor
of
a
british
general
and
afterward
not
enjoying
the
joke
the
fatalistic
valor
of
officers
and
men
in
civil
life
a
year
before
who
lived
with
the
knowledge
that
the
ground
beneath
them
was
mined
and
charged
with
high
explosives
and
might
hurl
them
to
eternity
between
the
whiffs
of
a
cigarette
we
were
sitting
in
the
garden
of
the
general
headquarters
having
a
picnic
meal
before
going
into
the
trenches
in
spite
of
the
wasps
which
attacked
the
sandwiches
it
was
a
nice
quiet
place
in
time
of
war
no
shell
same
crashing
in
our
neighborhood
though
we
were
well
within
range
of
the
enemy
guns
and
the
loudest
noise
was
the
drop
of
an
apple
in
the
orchard
later
on
a
shrill
whistle
signaled
a
hostile
airplane
overhead
but
it
passed
without
throwing
a
bomb
you
will
have
a
moist
time
in
some
of
the
trenches
said
the
general
whose
boots
were
finely
polished
the
rain
has
made
them
rather
damp
but
you
must
get
down
as
far
as
the
mine
craters
expecting
the
germans
to
fire
one
at
any
moment
and
some
of
our
trenches
are
only
six
yards
away
from
the
enemy
it
an
interesting
the
interest
of
it
seemed
to
me
too
much
of
a
good
thing
and
i
uttered
a
pious
prayer
that
the
enemy
would
not
explode
his
beastly
mine
under
me
it
makes
such
a
mess
of
a
man
a
staff
captain
came
out
with
a
report
which
he
read
the
sound
of
picks
has
been
heard
close
to
our
the
enemy
will
probably
explode
their
mine
in
a
few
that
the
place
i
was
telling
you
about
said
the
general
it
well
worth
a
visit
but
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
get
your
feet
as
long
as
i
could
keep
my
head
dry
and
firmly
fixed
to
my
shoulders
i
was
ready
to
brave
the
perils
of
wet
feet
with
any
man
it
had
been
raining
heavily
for
a
day
or
two
i
remember
thinking
that
in
london
which
seemed
a
long
way
off
people
were
going
about
under
umbrellas
and
looking
glum
when
their
clothes
were
splashed
by
passing
omnibuses
the
women
had
their
skirts
tucked
up
and
showed
their
pretty
ankles
those
things
used
to
happen
in
the
days
of
peace
but
in
the
trenches
those
that
lay
low
rain
meant
something
different
and
hideously
uncomfortable
for
men
who
lived
in
holes
our
soldiers
who
cursed
the
rain
as
in
the
old
days
they
swore
terribly
in
flanders
did
not
tuck
their
clothes
up
above
their
ankles
they
took
off
their
trousers
there
was
something
ludicrous
yet
pitiable
in
the
sight
of
those
hefty
men
coming
back
through
the
communication
trenches
with
the
tails
of
their
shirts
flapping
above
their
bare
legs
which
were
plastered
with
a
yellowish
mud
shouldering
their
rifles
or
their
spades
they
trudged
on
grimly
through
two
feet
of
water
and
the
boots
which
they
wore
without
socks
squelched
at
every
step
with
a
loud
sucking
noise
like
a
german
drinking
soup
said
an
officer
who
preceded
me
why
grouse
he
said
presently
it
better
than
brighton
it
was
a
queer
experience
this
paddling
through
the
long
communication
trenches
which
wound
in
and
out
like
the
hampton
court
maze
toward
the
front
line
and
the
mine
craters
which
made
a
salient
to
our
right
by
a
place
called
the
shells
came
whining
overhead
and
somewhere
behind
us
iron
doors
were
slamming
in
the
sky
with
metallic
bangs
as
though
opening
and
shutting
in
a
tempest
the
sharp
crack
of
showed
that
the
snipers
were
busy
on
both
sides
and
once
i
stood
in
a
deep
pool
with
the
water
up
to
my
knees
listening
to
what
sounded
like
the
of
invisible
blacksmiths
playing
a
tattoo
on
an
anvil
it
was
one
of
our
at
work
a
few
yards
away
from
my
head
which
i
ducked
below
the
trench
parapet
splodge
went
the
officer
in
front
of
me
with
a
yell
of
dismay
the
water
was
well
above
his
splosh
went
another
man
ahead
recovering
from
a
in
the
oozy
mud
and
clinging
desperately
to
some
bunches
of
yarrow
growing
up
the
side
of
the
trench
squelch
went
a
young
gentleman
whose
puttees
and
breeches
had
lost
their
glory
and
were
but
swabs
about
his
elegant
legs
clever
fellows
said
the
officer
as
two
of
us
climbed
on
to
the
of
the
trench
in
order
to
avoid
a
specially
deep
and
with
ducked
heads
and
bodies
bent
double
the
germans
were
only
two
hundred
yards
on
the
other
side
of
the
parapet
walked
on
dry
earth
for
at
least
ten
paces
the
officer
laughter
was
loud
at
the
corner
of
the
next
traverse
when
there
was
an
abrupt
descent
into
a
slough
of
despond
and
i
hope
they
can
swim
said
an
ironical
voice
from
a
dugout
as
the
officers
passed
they
were
lying
in
wet
mud
in
those
square
burrows
the
men
who
had
been
working
all
night
under
their
platoon
commanders
and
were
now
sleeping
and
resting
in
their
trench
dwellings
as
i
paddled
on
i
glanced
at
those
men
lying
on
straw
which
gave
out
a
moist
smell
mixed
with
the
pungent
vapors
of
chloride
of
lime
they
were
not
interested
in
the
german
guns
which
were
giving
their
daily
dose
of
hate
to
the
village
of
the
noise
did
not
interrupt
their
heavy
slumbrous
breathing
some
of
those
who
were
awake
were
reading
novelettes
forgetting
war
in
the
eternal
plot
of
cheap
romance
others
sat
at
the
entrance
of
their
burrows
with
their
knees
tucked
up
staring
gloomily
to
the
opposite
wall
of
the
trench
in
of
some
places
betwixt
aberdeen
and
hackney
downs
i
spoke
to
one
of
them
and
said
how
are
you
getting
on
he
answered
i
not
getting
on
i
do
see
the
fun
of
can
you
keep
dry
dry
i
soaked
to
the
what
it
like
here
it
hell
the
devils
blow
up
mines
to
make
things
another
boy
spoke
do
you
mind
what
he
says
sir
he
always
a
gloomy
bastard
believe
in
his
there
were
mascots
for
luck
at
the
doorways
of
their
dugouts
a
face
carved
in
chalk
the
name
of
a
girl
written
in
pebbles
a
portrait
of
the
king
in
a
frame
of
withered
wild
flowers
a
company
of
our
new
army
boys
had
respected
a
memento
of
french
troops
who
were
once
in
this
section
of
trenches
it
was
an
altar
built
into
the
side
of
the
trench
where
mass
was
said
each
morning
by
a
soldier
priest
it
was
decorated
with
vases
and
candlesticks
and
above
the
was
a
statue
crudely
modeled
upon
the
base
of
which
i
read
the
words
notre
dame
des
tranchees
our
lady
of
the
trenches
a
tablet
fastened
in
the
recorded
in
french
the
desire
of
those
who
worshiped
here
this
altar
dedicated
to
our
lady
of
the
trenches
was
blessed
by
the
chaplain
of
the
french
regiment
the
squadron
of
the
company
recommends
its
care
and
preservation
to
their
successors
please
do
not
touch
the
fragile
statue
in
our
lady
of
the
trenches
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
of
this
new
title
of
the
madonna
whose
spirit
if
she
visited
those
ditches
of
death
must
have
wept
with
pity
for
all
those
poor
children
of
mankind
whose
faith
was
so
unlike
the
work
they
had
to
do
from
a
dugout
near
the
altar
there
came
tinkling
music
a
young
soldier
was
playing
the
mandolin
to
two
comrades
all
the
latest
ragtime
said
one
of
them
with
a
grin
so
we
paddled
on
our
way
glimpsing
every
now
and
then
over
the
parapets
at
the
german
lines
a
few
hundred
yards
away
and
at
a
village
in
which
the
enemy
was
intrenched
quiet
and
sinister
there
the
water
through
which
we
waded
was
alive
with
a
multitude
of
swimming
frogs
red
slugs
crawled
up
the
sides
of
the
trenches
and
queer
beetles
with
horns
wriggled
along
dry
ledges
and
invaded
the
dugouts
in
search
of
the
vermin
which
infested
them
rats
are
the
worst
plague
said
a
colonel
coming
out
of
the
battalion
headquarters
where
he
had
a
hole
large
enough
for
a
bed
and
table
there
are
thousands
of
rats
in
this
part
of
the
line
and
audacious
devils
in
the
dugout
next
door
the
straw
at
night
writhes
with
them
i
do
mind
the
mice
so
much
one
of
them
comes
to
dinner
on
my
table
every
evening
a
friendly
little
beggar
who
is
very
pally
with
we
looked
out
above
the
a
chaos
of
tumbled
earth
where
our
trenches
ran
so
close
to
the
enemy
that
it
was
forbidden
to
smoke
or
talk
and
where
our
sappers
listened
with
all
their
souls
in
their
ears
to
any
little
tapping
or
picking
which
might
signal
approaching
upheaval
the
coats
of
some
french
soldiers
blown
up
long
ago
by
some
of
these
mines
looked
like
the
blue
of
the
chicory
flower
growing
in
the
soil
the
new
mine
was
not
fired
that
afternoon
up
to
the
time
of
my
going
away
but
it
was
fired
next
day
and
i
wondered
whether
the
gloomy
boy
had
gone
up
with
it
there
was
a
foreknowledge
of
death
in
his
eyes
one
of
the
officers
had
spoken
to
me
privately
i
afraid
of
losing
my
nerve
before
the
men
it
haunts
me
that
thought
the
shelling
is
bad
enough
but
it
the
mining
business
that
wears
one
nerve
to
shreds
one
never
i
hated
to
leave
him
there
to
his
agony
the
colonel
himself
was
all
nerves
and
he
loathed
the
rats
as
much
as
the
and
the
mining
those
big
lean
hungry
rats
of
the
trenches
who
invaded
the
dugouts
and
frisked
over
the
bodies
of
sleeping
men
one
young
subaltern
was
in
terror
of
them
he
told
me
how
he
shot
at
one
seeing
the
glint
of
its
eyes
in
the
darkness
the
bullet
from
his
revolver
ricocheted
from
wall
to
wall
and
he
was
nearly
for
having
fired
the
rats
the
lice
that
lived
on
the
bodies
of
our
men
the
trenches
the
which
broke
down
the
parapets
and
buried
men
in
wet
mud
wetter
for
their
blood
the
german
snipers
waiting
for
english
heads
and
then
the
mines
oh
a
cheery
little
school
of
courage
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
a
gentle
academy
of
war
for
the
devil
and
general
squeers
vii
the
city
of
ypres
was
the
capital
of
our
battlefields
in
flanders
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
war
and
the
ground
on
which
it
stands
whether
a
new
city
rises
there
or
its
remnants
of
ruin
stay
as
a
memorial
of
dreadful
things
will
be
forever
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
those
men
of
ours
who
passed
through
its
gates
to
fight
in
the
fields
beyond
or
to
fall
within
its
ramparts
i
went
through
ypres
so
many
times
in
early
days
and
late
days
of
the
war
that
i
think
i
could
find
my
way
about
it
blindfold
even
now
i
saw
it
first
in
march
of
before
the
battle
when
the
germans
first
used
and
bombarded
its
choking
people
and
french
and
british
soldiers
until
the
city
fell
into
a
chaos
of
masonry
on
that
first
visit
i
found
it
scarred
by
shell
fire
and
its
great
cloth
hall
was
roofless
and
licked
out
by
the
flame
of
burning
timbers
but
most
of
the
buildings
were
still
standing
and
the
shops
were
busy
with
customers
in
khaki
and
in
the
grande
place
were
many
small
booths
served
by
the
women
and
girls
who
sold
picture
and
flemish
lace
and
fancy
cakes
and
soap
to
british
soldiers
sauntering
about
without
a
thought
of
what
might
happen
here
in
this
city
so
close
to
the
enemy
lines
so
close
to
his
guns
i
had
tea
in
a
crowded
with
young
officers
who
were
served
by
two
flemish
girls
buxom
smiling
glad
of
all
the
english
money
they
were
making
a
few
weeks
later
the
devil
came
to
ypres
the
first
sign
of
his
work
was
when
a
mass
of
french
soldiers
and
colored
troops
and
english
irish
scottish
and
canadian
soldiers
came
staggering
through
the
lille
and
menin
gates
with
panic
in
their
look
and
some
foul
spell
upon
them
they
were
gasping
for
breath
vomiting
falling
into
unconsciousness
and
as
they
lay
their
lungs
were
struggling
desperately
against
some
stifling
thing
a
whitish
cloud
crept
up
to
the
gates
of
ypres
with
a
sweet
smell
of
violets
and
women
and
girls
smelled
it
and
then
gasped
and
lurched
as
they
ran
and
fell
it
was
after
that
when
shells
came
in
hurricane
flights
over
ypres
smashing
the
houses
and
setting
them
on
fire
until
they
toppled
and
fell
inside
themselves
hundreds
of
civilians
hid
in
their
cellars
and
many
were
buried
there
others
crawled
into
a
big
there
were
wounded
women
and
children
among
them
and
a
young
french
interpreter
the
baron
de
rosen
who
tried
to
help
them
and
they
stayed
there
three
days
and
nights
in
their
vomit
and
excrement
and
blood
until
the
bombardment
ceased
ypres
was
a
city
of
ruin
with
a
red
fire
in
its
heart
where
the
cloth
hall
and
cathedral
smoldered
below
their
broken
arches
and
high
ribs
of
masonry
that
had
been
their
buttresses
and
towers
when
i
went
there
two
months
later
i
saw
ypres
as
it
stood
through
the
years
of
the
war
that
followed
changing
only
in
the
disintegration
of
its
ruin
as
broken
walls
became
more
broken
and
fallen
houses
were
raked
into
smaller
fragments
by
new
bombardments
for
there
was
never
a
day
for
years
in
which
ypres
was
not
shelled
the
approach
to
it
was
sinister
after
one
had
left
poperinghe
and
passed
through
the
skeleton
of
vlamertinghe
church
beyond
goldfish
chateau
for
a
long
time
poperinghe
was
the
last
link
with
a
life
in
which
men
and
women
could
move
freely
without
hiding
from
the
pursuit
of
death
and
even
there
from
time
to
time
there
were
shells
from
guns
and
later
dropping
eggs
round
about
poperinghe
by
reninghelst
and
locre
long
convoys
of
taking
up
a
new
day
rations
from
the
raised
clouds
of
dust
which
powdered
the
hedges
white
flemish
with
huge
fringes
of
knotted
string
wended
their
way
between
and
often
the
sky
was
blue
above
the
with
fleecy
clouds
over
distant
woodlands
and
the
gray
old
towers
of
flemish
churches
and
the
windmills
on
mont
rouge
and
mont
neir
whose
sails
have
turned
through
centuries
of
peace
and
strife
it
all
comes
back
to
me
as
i
write
that
way
to
ypres
and
the
sounds
and
the
smells
of
the
roads
and
fields
where
the
traffic
of
war
went
up
month
after
month
year
after
year
that
day
when
i
saw
it
first
after
the
was
strangely
quiet
i
remember
there
was
nothing
doing
as
our
men
used
to
say
the
german
gunners
seemed
asleep
in
the
noonday
sun
and
it
was
a
charming
day
for
a
stroll
and
a
talk
about
the
raving
madness
of
war
under
every
old
hedge
what
about
lunch
in
dickebusch
on
the
way
up
asked
one
of
my
companions
there
were
three
of
us
it
seemed
a
good
idea
and
we
walked
toward
the
village
which
then
they
were
early
days
looked
a
peaceful
spot
with
a
shimmer
of
sunshine
above
its
gray
thatch
and
roofs
suddenly
one
of
us
said
good
god
an
iron
door
had
slammed
down
the
corridors
of
the
sky
and
the
hamlet
into
which
we
were
just
going
was
blotted
out
by
black
smoke
which
came
up
from
its
center
as
though
its
had
opened
up
and
vomited
out
infernal
vapors
a
big
shell
that
said
one
man
a
tall
officer
who
later
in
the
war
was
of
the
british
army
something
enraged
him
at
the
sight
of
that
shelled
village
damn
them
he
said
damn
the
war
damn
all
dirty
dogs
who
smash
up
life
four
times
the
thing
happened
and
we
were
glad
there
had
been
a
minute
or
so
between
us
and
dickebusch
in
dickebusch
my
young
cobbler
friend
from
fleet
street
was
crouching
low
expecting
death
the
peace
of
the
day
was
spoiled
there
was
seldom
a
real
peace
on
the
way
to
ypres
the
german
gunners
had
wakened
up
again
they
always
did
they
were
getting
busy
those
the
long
rush
of
shells
tore
great
holes
through
the
air
under
a
hedge
with
our
feet
in
the
ditch
we
ate
the
luncheon
we
had
carried
in
our
pockets
a
silly
idea
said
the
lanky
man
with
a
fierce
sad
look
in
his
eyes
he
was
and
a
man
of
letters
and
a
crack
shot
and
all
the
boys
he
knew
were
being
killed
what
silly
i
asked
wondering
what
particular
foolishness
he
was
thinking
of
in
a
world
of
folly
silly
to
die
with
a
broken
bit
of
sandwich
in
one
mouth
just
because
some
german
fellow
some
fat
stupid
man
a
few
miles
away
looses
off
a
bit
of
steel
in
search
of
the
bodies
of
men
with
whom
he
has
no
personal
damn
silly
i
said
that
all
there
is
to
it
in
modern
warfare
said
the
lanky
man
not
like
the
old
way
of
fighting
body
to
body
your
strength
against
your
enemy
your
cunning
against
his
now
it
is
mechanics
and
chemistry
what
is
the
splendor
of
courage
the
glory
of
youth
when
guns
kill
at
fifteen
miles
afterward
this
man
went
close
to
the
enemy
devised
tricks
to
make
him
show
his
head
and
shot
each
head
that
showed
the
guns
ceased
fire
their
tumult
died
down
and
all
was
quiet
again
it
was
horribly
quiet
on
our
way
into
ypres
across
the
railway
past
the
asylum
where
a
calvary
hung
unscathed
on
broken
walls
past
the
at
the
crossroads
this
silence
was
not
reassuring
as
our
heels
clicked
over
bits
of
broken
brick
on
our
way
into
ypres
the
enemy
had
been
shelling
heavily
for
of
an
hour
in
the
morning
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
begin
again
i
remember
now
the
intense
silence
of
the
grande
place
that
day
after
the
when
we
three
men
stood
there
looking
up
at
the
charred
ruins
of
the
cloth
hall
it
was
a
great
solitude
of
ruin
no
living
figure
stirred
among
the
piles
of
masonry
which
were
tombstones
above
many
dead
we
three
were
like
travelers
who
had
come
to
some
capital
of
an
old
and
buried
civilization
staring
with
awe
and
uncanny
fear
at
this
of
ancient
splendor
with
broken
traces
of
peoples
who
once
had
lived
here
in
security
i
looked
up
at
the
blue
sky
above
those
white
ruins
and
had
an
idea
that
death
hovered
there
like
a
hawk
ready
to
pounce
even
as
one
of
us
not
i
spoke
the
thought
the
signal
came
it
was
a
humming
drone
high
up
in
the
sky
look
out
said
the
lanky
man
germans
it
was
certain
that
two
birds
hovering
over
the
grande
place
were
hostile
things
because
suddenly
white
puffballs
burst
all
round
them
as
the
shrapnel
of
our
own
guns
scattered
about
them
but
they
flew
round
steadily
in
a
until
they
were
poised
above
our
heads
it
was
time
to
seek
cover
which
was
not
easy
to
find
just
there
where
masses
of
stonework
were
piled
high
at
any
moment
things
might
drop
i
ducked
my
head
behind
a
curtain
of
bricks
as
i
heard
a
shrill
from
a
shell
it
burst
close
with
a
scatter
and
a
tin
cup
was
flung
against
a
bit
of
wall
close
to
where
the
lanky
man
sat
in
a
he
picked
it
up
and
said
queer
and
then
smelled
it
and
said
queer
again
it
was
not
an
ordinary
bomb
it
had
held
some
poisonous
liquid
from
a
german
chemist
shop
other
bombs
were
dropping
round
as
the
two
hostile
airmen
circled
overhead
untouched
still
by
the
following
then
they
passed
toward
their
own
lines
and
my
friend
in
the
called
to
me
and
said
let
be
it
was
time
to
go
when
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
town
our
guns
away
back
started
shelling
and
we
knew
the
germans
would
answer
so
we
sat
in
a
field
nearby
to
watch
the
bombardment
the
air
moved
with
the
rushing
waves
which
tracked
the
carry
of
each
shell
from
our
batteries
and
over
ypres
came
the
high
singsong
of
the
enemies
answering
voice
as
the
dusk
fell
there
was
a
movement
out
from
vlamertinghe
a
movement
of
transport
wagons
and
marching
men
they
were
going
up
in
the
darkness
through
ypres
rations
and
reliefs
they
were
the
new
army
men
of
the
west
riding
carry
on
there
said
a
young
officer
at
the
head
of
his
company
something
in
his
eyes
startled
me
was
it
fear
or
an
act
of
sacrifice
i
wondered
if
he
would
be
killed
that
night
men
were
killed
most
nights
on
the
way
through
ypres
sometimes
a
few
and
sometimes
many
one
shell
killed
thirty
one
night
and
their
bodies
lay
strewn
headless
and
limbless
at
the
corner
of
the
grande
place
transport
wagons
galloped
their
way
through
between
bursts
of
hoping
to
dodge
them
and
sometimes
not
dodging
them
i
saw
the
litter
of
their
wheels
and
shafts
and
the
bodies
of
the
drivers
and
the
raw
flesh
of
the
dead
horses
that
had
not
dodged
them
many
men
were
buried
alive
in
ypres
under
masses
of
masonry
when
they
had
been
sleeping
in
cellars
and
were
wakened
by
the
avalanche
above
them
comrades
tried
to
dig
them
out
to
pull
away
great
stones
to
get
down
to
those
vaults
below
from
which
voices
were
calling
and
while
they
worked
other
shells
came
and
laid
dead
bodies
above
the
stones
which
had
entombed
their
living
comrades
that
happened
not
once
or
twice
but
many
times
in
ypres
there
was
a
town
major
of
ypres
men
said
it
was
a
sentence
of
death
to
any
officer
appointed
to
that
job
i
think
one
of
them
i
met
had
had
eleven
predecessors
he
sat
in
a
cellar
of
the
old
prison
with
walls
of
sandbags
on
each
side
of
him
but
he
could
not
sit
there
very
long
at
a
stretch
because
it
was
his
duty
to
regulate
the
traffic
according
to
the
he
kept
a
visitors
book
as
a
hobby
until
it
was
buried
under
piles
of
prison
and
was
a
hearty
cheerful
soul
in
spite
of
the
menace
of
death
always
about
him
viii
my
memory
goes
back
to
a
strange
night
in
ypres
in
those
early
days
it
was
gullett
the
australian
eyewitness
afterward
in
palestine
who
had
the
idea
it
would
be
a
great
adventure
he
said
as
we
stood
listening
to
the
over
there
it
would
be
damn
silly
said
a
staff
officer
only
a
stern
sense
of
duty
would
make
me
do
it
was
gullett
who
was
the
brave
man
we
took
a
bottle
of
cointreau
and
a
sweet
cake
as
a
gift
to
any
battalion
mess
we
might
find
in
the
ramparts
and
were
sorry
for
ourselves
when
we
failed
to
find
it
nor
for
a
long
time
any
living
soul
our
own
footsteps
were
the
noisiest
sounds
as
we
stumbled
over
the
broken
stones
no
other
footstep
paced
down
any
of
those
streets
of
shattered
houses
through
which
we
wandered
with
tightened
nerves
there
was
no
movement
among
all
those
rubbish
heaps
of
fallen
masonry
and
twisted
iron
we
were
in
the
loneliness
of
a
sepulcher
which
had
been
once
a
fair
city
for
a
little
while
my
friend
and
i
stood
in
the
grande
place
not
speaking
in
the
deepening
twilight
beneath
the
last
of
the
sinking
sun
and
the
first
stars
that
glimmered
in
a
pale
sky
the
frightful
beauty
of
the
ruins
put
a
spell
upon
us
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
rose
high
above
the
framework
of
broken
arches
and
single
pillars
like
a
white
rock
which
had
been
split
from
end
to
end
by
a
thunderbolt
a
recent
shell
had
torn
out
a
slice
so
that
the
top
of
the
tower
was
supported
only
upon
broken
buttresses
and
the
great
pile
was
hollowed
out
like
a
decayed
tooth
the
cloth
hall
was
but
a
skeleton
in
stone
with
immense
gaunt
ribs
about
the
dead
carcass
of
its
former
majesty
beyond
the
tower
of
mark
was
a
stark
ruin
which
gleamed
white
through
the
darkening
twilight
we
felt
as
men
who
should
stand
gazing
upon
the
ruins
of
westminster
abbey
while
the
shadows
of
night
crept
into
their
dark
caverns
and
into
their
yawning
chasms
of
chaotic
masonry
with
a
gleam
of
moon
upon
their
riven
towers
and
fingers
of
pale
light
touching
the
ribs
of
isolated
arches
in
the
spaciousness
of
the
grande
place
at
ypres
my
friend
and
i
stood
like
the
last
men
on
earth
in
a
city
of
buried
life
it
was
almost
dark
now
as
we
made
our
way
through
other
streets
of
rubbish
heaps
strangely
enough
as
i
remember
many
of
the
iron
had
been
left
standing
though
bent
and
twisted
in
a
drunken
way
and
here
and
there
we
caught
the
sweet
whiff
of
flowers
and
plants
still
growing
in
gardens
which
had
not
been
utterly
destroyed
by
the
daily
tempest
of
shells
though
the
houses
about
them
had
been
all
wrecked
the
woods
below
the
ramparts
were
slashed
and
torn
by
these
storms
and
in
the
darkness
lightened
faintly
by
the
crescent
moon
we
stumbled
over
broken
branches
and
innumerable
the
silence
was
broken
now
by
the
roar
of
a
gun
which
sounded
so
loud
that
i
jumped
sideways
with
the
sudden
shock
of
it
it
seemed
to
be
the
signal
for
our
batteries
and
shell
after
shell
went
rushing
through
the
night
with
that
long
menacing
hiss
which
ends
in
a
dull
blast
the
reports
of
the
guns
and
the
explosions
of
the
shells
followed
each
other
and
mingled
in
an
enormous
tumult
echoed
back
by
the
ruins
of
ypres
in
hollow
reverberating
the
enemy
was
answering
back
not
very
fiercely
yet
and
from
the
center
of
the
town
in
or
about
the
grande
place
came
the
noise
of
falling
houses
or
of
huge
blocks
of
stone
splitting
into
fragments
we
groped
along
scared
with
the
sense
of
death
around
us
the
first
flares
of
the
night
were
being
lighted
by
both
sides
above
their
trenches
on
each
side
of
the
salient
the
balls
of
light
rose
into
the
velvety
darkness
and
a
moment
later
suffused
the
sky
with
a
white
glare
which
faded
away
tremulously
after
half
a
minute
against
the
first
vivid
brightness
of
it
the
lines
of
trees
along
the
roads
to
hooge
were
silhouetted
as
black
as
ink
and
the
fields
between
ypres
and
the
trenches
were
flooded
with
a
milky
luminance
the
whole
shape
of
the
salient
was
revealed
to
us
in
those
flashes
we
could
see
all
those
places
for
which
our
soldiers
fought
and
died
we
stared
across
the
fields
beyond
the
menin
road
toward
the
hooge
crater
and
those
trenches
which
were
battered
to
pieces
but
not
abandoned
in
the
first
battle
of
ypres
and
the
second
battle
that
salient
was
even
then
in
a
graveyard
of
british
soldiers
there
were
years
to
follow
when
many
more
would
lie
there
and
as
between
flash
and
flash
the
scene
was
revealed
i
seemed
to
see
a
great
army
of
ghosts
the
spirits
of
all
those
boys
who
had
died
on
this
ground
it
was
the
darkness
and
the
tumult
of
guns
and
our
loneliness
here
on
the
ramparts
which
put
an
edge
to
my
nerves
and
made
me
see
unnatural
things
no
wonder
a
sentry
was
startled
when
he
saw
our
two
figures
approaching
him
through
a
clump
of
trees
his
words
rang
out
like
halt
who
goes
there
friends
we
shouted
seeing
the
gleam
of
light
on
a
shaking
bayonet
come
close
to
be
recognized
he
said
and
his
voice
was
harsh
we
went
close
and
i
for
one
was
afraid
young
sentries
sometimes
shot
too
soon
who
are
you
he
asked
in
a
more
natural
voice
and
when
we
explained
he
laughed
gruffly
i
never
saw
two
strangers
pass
this
way
before
he
was
an
old
soldier
back
to
the
army
again
with
kitchener
men
he
had
been
in
the
chitral
campaign
and
south
africa
little
wars
compared
to
this
as
he
said
a
fine
simple
man
and
although
a
bricklayer
laborer
in
private
life
with
a
knowledge
of
the
right
word
i
was
struck
when
he
said
that
the
german
flares
were
more
luminous
than
ours
i
could
hardly
see
his
face
in
the
darkness
except
when
he
struck
a
match
once
but
his
figure
was
black
against
the
illumined
sky
and
i
watched
the
motion
of
his
arm
as
he
pointed
to
the
roads
up
which
his
comrades
had
gone
to
the
support
of
another
battalion
at
hooge
who
were
hard
pressed
they
went
along
under
a
lot
of
shrapnel
and
had
many
he
told
the
story
of
that
night
in
a
quiet
thoughtful
way
with
phrases
of
almost
biblical
beauty
in
their
simple
truth
and
the
soul
of
the
man
the
spirit
of
the
whole
army
in
which
he
was
a
private
soldier
was
revealed
when
he
flashed
out
a
sentence
with
his
one
note
of
fire
but
the
enemy
lost
more
than
we
did
sir
that
night
we
wandered
away
again
into
the
darkness
with
the
din
of
the
bombardment
all
about
us
there
was
not
a
square
yard
of
ground
unplowed
by
shells
and
we
did
not
nourish
any
false
illusions
as
to
finding
a
safe
spot
for
a
bivouac
there
was
no
spot
within
the
ramparts
of
ypres
where
a
man
might
say
no
shells
will
fall
but
one
place
we
found
where
there
seemed
some
reasonable
odds
of
safety
there
also
if
sleep
assailed
us
we
might
curl
up
in
an
abandoned
dugout
and
hope
that
it
would
not
be
crumped
before
the
dawn
there
were
several
of
these
shelters
there
but
peering
into
them
by
the
light
of
a
match
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
lying
in
one
of
them
they
had
been
long
out
of
use
and
there
was
a
foul
look
about
the
damp
bedding
and
rugs
which
had
been
left
to
rot
there
they
were
inhabited
already
by
cats
the
abandoned
cats
of
ypres
which
hunted
mice
through
the
ruins
of
their
old
houses
and
they
spat
at
me
and
glared
with
fear
as
i
thrust
a
match
into
their
lairs
there
were
two
kitchen
chairs
with
a
deal
table
on
which
we
put
our
cake
and
cointreau
and
here
through
half
a
night
my
friend
and
i
sat
watching
and
listening
to
that
weird
scene
upon
which
the
old
moon
looked
down
and
as
two
men
will
at
such
a
time
we
talked
over
all
the
problems
of
life
and
death
and
the
meaning
of
man
heritage
another
sentry
challenged
us
all
his
nerves
jangled
at
our
apparition
he
was
a
young
fellow
one
of
kitchener
crowd
and
told
us
frankly
that
he
had
the
jimjams
in
this
solitude
of
ypres
and
saw
germans
every
time
a
rat
jumped
he
lingered
near
us
for
company
it
was
becoming
chilly
the
dew
made
our
clothes
damp
cake
and
sweet
liquor
were
poor
provisions
for
the
night
and
the
thought
of
hot
tea
was
infinitely
seductive
perhaps
somewhere
one
might
find
a
few
soldiers
round
a
kettle
in
some
friendly
dugout
we
groped
our
way
along
holding
our
breath
at
times
as
a
shell
came
sweeping
overhead
or
burst
with
a
sputter
of
steel
against
the
ramparts
it
was
profoundly
dark
so
that
only
the
glowworms
glittered
like
jewels
on
black
velvet
the
moon
had
gone
down
and
inside
ypres
the
light
of
the
distant
flares
only
glimmered
faintly
above
the
broken
walls
in
a
tunnel
of
darkness
voices
were
speaking
and
some
one
was
whistling
softly
and
a
gleam
of
red
light
made
a
bar
across
the
grass
we
walked
toward
a
group
of
black
figures
suddenly
silent
at
our
approach
obviously
startled
who
there
said
a
voice
we
were
just
in
time
for
tea
a
stroke
of
luck
with
a
company
of
boys
all
kitchener
lads
from
the
civil
service
who
were
spending
the
night
here
they
had
made
a
fire
behind
a
screen
to
give
them
a
little
comfort
and
frighten
off
the
ghosts
and
gossiped
with
a
queer
sense
of
humor
cynical
and
blasphemous
but
even
through
their
jokes
there
was
a
yearning
for
the
end
of
a
business
which
was
too
close
to
death
i
remember
the
gist
of
their
conversation
which
was
partly
devised
for
my
benefit
one
boy
declared
that
he
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
i
should
like
to
cancel
my
contract
he
remarked
yes
send
in
your
resignation
old
lad
said
another
with
ironical
laughter
they
consider
it
would
they
offer
a
rise
in
wages
i
do
think
another
boy
said
i
am
a
citizen
of
no
mean
empire
but
what
the
hell
is
the
empire
going
to
do
for
me
when
the
next
shell
blows
off
both
my
bleeding
legs
this
remark
was
also
received
by
a
gust
of
subdued
laughter
silenced
for
a
moment
by
a
roar
and
upheaval
of
masonry
somewhere
by
the
ruins
of
the
cloth
hall
soldiers
are
prisoners
said
a
boy
without
any
trace
of
humor
lagged
and
you
ca
escape
a
is
the
best
luck
you
can
hope
i
do
want
to
kill
germans
said
a
fellow
with
a
superior
accent
i
no
personal
quarrel
against
them
and
anyhow
i
do
like
butcher
christian
service
that
what
the
padre
calls
it
i
wonder
if
christ
would
have
stuck
a
bayonet
into
a
german
stomach
a
german
with
his
hands
up
that
what
we
asked
to
oh
christianity
is
out
of
business
my
child
why
mention
it
this
is
war
and
we
back
to
the
primitive
state
all
the
same
i
say
my
little
prayers
when
i
in
a
blue
funk
gentle
jesus
meek
and
mild
look
upon
a
little
this
last
remark
was
the
prize
joke
of
the
evening
received
with
much
hilarity
not
too
loud
for
fear
of
drawing
fire
though
really
no
germans
could
have
heard
any
laughter
in
ypres
nearby
their
officer
was
spending
the
night
we
called
on
him
and
found
him
sitting
alone
in
a
dugout
furnished
by
odd
bits
from
the
wrecked
houses
with
waxen
flowers
in
a
glass
case
on
the
shelf
and
an
old
cottage
clock
which
ticked
out
the
night
and
a
velvet
armchair
which
had
been
the
pride
of
a
flemish
home
he
was
a
devonshire
lad
with
a
pale
thoughtful
face
and
i
was
sorry
for
him
in
his
loneliness
with
a
roof
over
his
head
which
would
be
no
proof
against
a
shell
he
expressed
no
surprise
at
seeing
us
i
think
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
the
ghost
of
edward
the
black
prince
had
called
on
him
he
would
have
greeted
him
with
the
same
politeness
and
offered
him
his
green
armchair
the
night
passed
the
guns
slackened
down
before
the
dawn
for
a
little
while
there
was
almost
silence
even
over
the
trenches
but
as
the
first
faint
glow
of
dawn
crept
through
the
darkness
the
burst
out
again
feverishly
and
the
clucked
with
new
spasms
of
ferocity
the
boys
of
the
new
army
and
the
germans
facing
them
had
an
attack
of
the
nerves
as
always
at
that
hour
the
flares
were
still
rising
but
had
the
debauched
look
of
belated
fireworks
after
a
night
of
orgy
in
a
distant
field
a
cock
crew
the
dawn
lightened
all
the
sky
and
the
shadows
crept
away
from
the
ruins
of
ypres
and
all
the
ghastly
wreckage
of
the
city
was
revealed
again
nakedly
then
the
guns
ceased
for
a
while
and
there
was
quietude
in
the
trenches
and
out
of
ypres
sneaking
by
side
ways
went
two
tired
figures
padding
the
hoof
with
a
slouching
swiftness
to
escape
the
early
morning
hate
which
was
sure
to
come
as
soon
as
a
clock
in
vlamertinghe
still
working
in
a
ruined
tower
chimed
the
hour
of
six
i
went
through
ypres
scores
of
times
afterward
and
during
the
battles
of
flanders
saw
it
day
by
day
as
columns
of
men
and
guns
and
and
transports
went
up
toward
the
ridge
which
led
at
last
to
passchendaele
we
had
big
guns
in
the
ruins
of
ypres
and
round
about
and
they
fired
with
violent
concussions
which
shook
loose
stones
and
their
flashes
were
red
through
the
flanders
mist
always
this
capital
of
the
battlefields
was
sinister
with
the
sense
of
menace
about
steel
helmets
to
be
worn
at
the
so
said
the
traffic
man
at
the
crossroads
as
one
strapped
on
one
steel
helmet
and
shortened
the

of
the
spirit
of
ypres
touched
one
soul
icily
ix
the
worst
school
of
war
for
the
sons
of
gentlemen
was
in
those
early
days
and
for
long
afterward
hooge
that
was
the
devil
playground
and
his
chamber
of
horrors
wherein
he
devised
merry
tortures
for
young
christian
men
it
was
not
far
out
of
ypres
to
the
left
of
the
menin
road
and
to
the
north
of
zouave
wood
and
sanctuary
wood
for
a
time
there
was
a
chateau
there
called
the
white
chateau
with
excellent
stables
and
good
accommodation
for
one
of
our
brigade
staffs
until
one
of
our
generals
was
killed
and
others
wounded
by
a
shell
which
broke
up
their
conference
afterward
there
was
no
chateau
but
only
a
rubble
of
bricks
banked
up
with
sandbags
and
deep
filled
with
stinking
water
slopping
over
from
the
bellewarde
lake
and
pools
bodies
and
bits
of
bodies
and
clots
of
blood
and
green
slime
made
by
explosive
gases
were
floating
on
the
surface
of
that
water
below
the
crater
banks
when
i
first
passed
that
way
and
so
it
was
always
our
men
lived
there
and
died
there
within
a
few
yards
of
the
enemy
crouched
below
the
and
burrowed
in
the
sides
of
the
crater
lice
crawled
over
them
in
legions
human
flesh
rotting
and
stinking
mere
pulp
was
pasted
into
the
if
they
dug
to
get
deeper
cover
their
shovels
went
into
the
softness
of
dead
bodies
who
had
been
their
comrades
scraps
of
flesh
booted
legs
blackened
hands
eyeless
heads
came
falling
over
them
when
the
enemy
their
position
or
blew
up
a
new
i
remember
one
young
irish
officer
who
came
down
to
bur
quarters
on
a
brief
respite
from
commanding
the
garrison
at
hooge
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
like
young
philip
of
spain
by
velasquez
and
he
had
a
profound
melancholy
in
his
eyes
in
spite
of
a
charming
smile
do
you
mind
if
i
have
a
bath
before
i
join
you
he
asked
he
walked
about
in
the
open
air
until
the
bath
was
ready
even
there
a
strong
fetid
smell
came
from
him
hooge
he
said
in
a
thoughtful
way
is
not
a
health
he
was
more
cheerful
after
his
bath
and
did
not
feel
quite
such
a
leper
he
told
one
or
two
stories
about
the
things
that
happened
at
hooge
and
i
wondered
if
hell
could
be
so
bad
after
a
short
stay
he
went
back
again
and
i
could
see
that
he
expected
to
be
killed
before
saying
he
touched
some
flowers
on
the
and
for
a
moment
or
two
listened
to
birds
twittering
in
the
trees
thanks
very
much
he
said
i
enjoyed
this
visit
a
good
he
went
back
through
ypres
on
the
way
to
hooge
and
the
where
his
irish
soldiers
were
lying
in
slime
in
which
vermin
crawled
sometimes
it
was
the
enemy
who
mined
under
our
position
blowing
a
few
men
to
bits
and
scattering
the
sometimes
it
was
our
men
who
upheaved
the
earth
beyond
them
by
mine
charges
and
rushed
the
new
crater
it
was
in
july
of
that
the
devils
of
hooge
became
merry
and
bright
with
increased
activity
the
germans
had
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
which
formed
the
apex
of
a
triangle
across
the
menin
road
with
trenches
running
down
to
it
on
either
side
so
that
it
was
like
the
of
their
position
they
had
fortified
it
with
and
crammed
it
with
machine
guns
which
could
sweep
the
ground
on
three
sides
so
making
a
direct
attack
by
infantry
a
suicidal
enterprise
our
trenches
immediately
faced
this
stronghold
from
the
other
side
of
a
road
at
right
angles
with
the
menin
road
and
our
men
the
new
army
boys
were
shelled
day
and
night
so
that
many
of
them
were
torn
to
pieces
and
others
buried
alive
and
others
sent
mad
by
they
were
learning
their
lessons
in
the
school
of
courage
it
was
decided
by
a
conference
of
generals
not
at
hooge
to
clear
out
this
hornets
nest
and
the
job
was
given
to
the
sappers
who
mined
under
the
roadway
toward
the
redoubt
while
our
heavy
artillery
shelled
the
enemy
position
all
around
the
neighborhood
on
july
the
mine
was
exploded
while
our
men
crouched
low
horribly
afraid
after
hours
of
suspense
the
earth
was
rent
asunder
by
a
gust
of
flame
and
vomited
up
a
tumult
of
soil
and
stones
and
human
limbs
and
bodies
our
men
still
crouched
while
these
things
fell
upon
them
i
thought
i
had
been
blown
to
bits
one
of
them
told
me
i
was
a
quaking
fear
with
my
head
in
the
earth
i
kept
saying
christ
when
the
earth
and
smoke
had
settled
again
it
was
seen
that
the
redoubt
had
ceased
to
exist
in
its
place
where
there
had
been
a
crisscross
of
trenches
and
shelters
for
their
and
a
network
of
barbed
wire
there
was
now
an
enormous
crater
hollowed
deep
with
shelving
sides
surrounded
by
tumbled
earth
heaps
which
had
blocked
up
the
enemy
trenches
on
either
side
of
the
position
so
that
they
could
not
rush
into
the
cavern
and
take
possession
it
was
our
men
who
rushed
the
crater
and
lay
there
panting
in
its
smoking
soil
our
generals
had
asked
for
trouble
when
they
destroyed
that
redoubt
and
our
men
had
it
infuriated
by
a
massacre
of
their
garrison
in
the
and
by
the
loss
of
their
the
germans
kept
up
a
furious
bombardment
on
our
trenches
in
that
neighborhood
in
bursts
of
which
tossed
our
earthworks
about
and
killed
and
wounded
many
men
our
line
at
hooge
at
that
time
was
held
by
the
king
royal
rifles
of
the
division
young
fellows
not
far
advanced
in
the
of
war
they
held
on
under
the
gunning
of
their
positions
and
each
man
among
them
wondered
whether
it
was
the
shell
screeching
overhead
or
the
next
which
would
smash
him
into
pulp
like
those
bodies
lying
nearby
in
dugouts
and
upheaved
earthworks
on
the
morning
of
july
there
was
a
strange
lull
of
silence
after
a
heavy
bout
of
shells
and
mortars
men
of
the
raised
their
heads
above
broken
parapets
and
crawled
out
of
and
looked
about
there
were
many
dead
bodies
lying
around
and
wounded
men
were
wailing
the
unwounded
startled
by
the
silence
became
aware
of
some
moisture
falling
on
them
thick
oily
drops
of
liquid
what
in
hell
name
said
a
subaltern
one
man
smelled
his
clothes
which
reeked
of
something
like
paraffin
coming
across
from
the
german
trenches
were
men
hunched
up
under
some
heavy
weights
they
were
carrying
cylinders
with
nozles
like
suddenly
there
was
a
rushing
noise
like
an
escape
of
air
from
some
long
tongues
of
flame
licked
across
to
the
broken
ground
where
the
king
royal
rifles
lay
some
of
them
were
set
on
fire
their
clothes
burning
on
them
making
them
living
torches
and
in
a
second
or
two
cinders
it
was
a
new
horror
of
war
the
flammenwerfer
some
of
the
men
leaped
to
their
feet
cursing
and
fired
repeatedly
at
the
germans
carrying
the
flaming
jets
here
and
there
the
shots
were
true
a
man
hunched
under
a
cylinder
exploded
like
a
fat
moth
caught
in
a
but
that
advancing
line
of
fire
after
the
long
bombardment
was
too
much
for
the
rank
and
file
whose
clothes
were
smoking
and
whose
bodies
were
scorched
in
something
like
a
panic
they
fell
back
abandoning
the
cratered
ground
in
which
their
dead
lay
the
news
of
this
disaster
and
of
the
new
horror
reached
the
troops
in
reserve
who
had
been
resting
in
the
rear
after
a
long
spell
they
moved
up
at
once
to
support
their
comrades
and
make
a
the
ground
they
had
to
cover
was
swept
by
and
many
fell
but
the
others
attacked
again
and
again
regardless
of
their
losses
and
won
back
part
of
the
lost
ground
leaving
only
a
depth
of
five
hundred
yards
in
the
enemy
hands
so
the
position
remained
until
the
morning
of
august
when
a
new
attack
was
begun
by
the
durham
yorkshire
lancashire
and
midland
troops
of
the
division
who
had
been
long
in
the
salient
and
had
proved
the
quality
of
northern
grit
in
the
foul
places
and
the
foul
weather
of
that
region
it
was
late
on
the
night
of
august
that
these
battalions
took
up
their
position
ready
for
the
assault
these
men
who
came
mostly
from
mines
and
workshops
were
hard
and
steady
and
did
not
show
any
outward
sign
of
nervousness
though
they
knew
well
enough
that
before
the
light
of
another
day
came
their
numbers
would
have
passed
through
the
lottery
of
this
game
of
death
each
man
life
depended
on
no
more
than
a
fluke
of
luck
by
the
throw
of
those
dice
which
explode
as
they
fall
they
knew
what
their
job
was
it
was
to
cross
five
hundred
yards
of
open
ground
to
capture
and
to
hold
a
certain
part
of
the
german
position
near
the
chateau
of
hooge
they
were
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
which
made
a
german
salient
after
the
ground
was
lost
on
july
on
the
left
side
of
the
triangle
was
zouave
wood
and
sanctuary
wood
ran
up
the
right
side
to
a
strong
fort
held
by
the
enemy
and
crammed
with
and
every
kind
of
bomb
the
base
of
the
upturned
triangle
was
made
by
the
menin
road
to
the
north
beyond
which
lay
the
crater
the
chateau
and
the
stables
the
way
that
lay
between
the
regiment
and
their
goal
was
not
an
easy
one
to
pass
it
was
cut
and
crosscut
by
our
old
trenches
now
held
by
the
enemy
who
had
made
tangles
of
barbed
wire
in
front
of
their
parapets
and
had
placed
at
various
points
the
ground
was
littered
with
dead
bodies
belonging
to
the
battle
of
july
and
by
deep
to
cross
five
hundred
yards
of
such
ground
in
the
storm
of
the
enemy
fire
would
be
an
ordeal
greater
than
that
of
rushing
from
one
trench
to
another
it
would
have
to
be
done
in
regular
attack
formation
and
with
the
best
of
luck
would
be
a
grim
and
costly
progress
the
night
was
pitch
dark
the
men
drawn
up
could
only
see
one
another
as
shadows
blacker
than
the
night
they
were
very
quiet
each
man
was
fighting
down
his
fear
in
his
soul
trying
to
get
a
grip
on
nerves
hideously
strained
by
the
rack
of
this
suspense
the
words
steady
were
spoken
down
the
ranks
by
young
lieutenants
and
sergeants
the
sounds
of
men
whispering
a
cough
here
and
there
a
word
of
command
the
clink
of
bayonets
the
cracking
of
twigs
under
heavy
boots
the
shuffle
of
troops
getting
into
line
would
not
carry
with
any
loudness
to
german
ears
the
men
deployed
before
dawn
broke
waiting
for
the
preliminary
bombardment
which
would
smash
a
way
for
them
the
officers
struck
matches
now
and
then
to
glance
at
their
set
very
carefully
to
those
of
the
gunners
then
our
artillery
burst
forth
with
an
enormous
violence
of
so
that
the
night
was
shattered
with
the
tumult
of
it
guns
of
every
caliber
mingled
their
explosions
and
the
long
screech
of
the
shells
rushed
through
the
air
as
though
thousands
of
engines
were
chasing
one
another
madly
through
a
vast
junction
in
that
black
vault
the
men
listened
and
waited
as
soon
as
the
guns
lengthened
their
fuses
the
infantry
advance
would
begin
their
nerves
were
getting
jangled
it
was
just
the
torture
of
human
animals
there
was
an
indrawing
of
breath
when
suddenly
the
enemy
began
to
fire
rockets
sending
up
flares
which
made
white
waves
of
light
if
they
were
seen
there
would
be
a
shambles
but
the
smoke
of
all
the
bursting
shells
rolled
up
in
a
thick
veil
hiding
those
mining
lads
who
stared
toward
the
illuminations
above
the
black
vapors
and
at
the
flashes
which
seemed
to
stab
great
rents
in
the
pall
of
smoke
it
was
a
jumpy
moment
said
the
colonel
of
the
durhams
and
the
moment
lengthened
into
minutes
then
the
time
came
the
watch
hands
pointed
to
the
second
which
had
been
given
for
the
assault
to
begin
and
instantly
to
the
tick
the
guns
lifted
and
made
a
curtain
of
fire
round
the
chateau
of
hooge
beyond
the
menin
road
six
hundred
yards
away
time
the
company
officers
blew
their
whistles
and
there
was
a
sudden
clatter
from
slung
to
and
from
men
girdled
with
as
the
advancing
companies
deployed
and
made
their
first
rush
forward
the
ground
had
been
churned
up
by
our
shells
and
the
trenches
had
been
battered
into
shapelessness
strewn
with
broken
wire
and
heaps
of
loose
stones
and
fragments
of
steel
it
seemed
impossible
that
any
german
should
be
left
alive
in
this
quagmire
but
there
was
still
a
rattle
of
from
holes
and
hillocks
not
for
long
the
searched
and
found
them
and
silenced
them
from
the
heaps
of
earth
which
had
once
been
trenches
german
soldiers
rose
and
staggered
in
a
dazed
drunken
way
stupefied
by
the
bombardment
beneath
which
they
had
crouched
our
men
spitted
them
on
their
bayonets
or
hurled
and
swept
the
ground
before
them
some
germans
screeched
like
pigs
in
a
the
men
went
on
in
short
rushes
they
were
across
the
menin
road
now
and
were
first
to
the
crater
though
other
troops
were
advancing
quickly
from
the
left
they
went
down
into
the
crater
shouting
hoarsely
and
hurling
bombs
at
germans
who
were
caught
like
rats
in
a
trap
and
scurried
up
the
steep
sides
beyond
firing
before
rolling
down
again
until
at
least
two
hundred
bodies
lay
dead
at
the
bottom
of
this
pit
of
hell
while
some
of
the
men
dug
themselves
into
the
crater
or
held
the
dugouts
already
made
by
the
enemy
others
climbed
up
to
the
ridge
beyond
and
with
a
final
rush
almost
winded
and
spent
reached
the
extreme
limit
of
their
line
of
assault
and
achieved
the
task
which
had
been
set
them
they
were
mad
now
not
human
in
their
senses
they
saw
red
through
bloodshot
eyes
they
were
beasts
of
prey
these
decent
yorkshire
lads
round
the
stables
themselves
three
hundred
germans
were
bayoneted
until
not
a
single
enemy
lived
on
this
ground
and
the
light
of
day
on
that
of
august
revealed
a
bloody
and
terrible
scene
not
decent
for
words
to
tell
not
decent
but
a
shambles
of
human
flesh
which
had
been
a
crowd
of
living
men
crying
for
mercy
with
that
dreadful
screech
of
terror
from
german
boys
who
saw
the
white
gleam
of
steel
at
their
stomachs
before
they
were
spitted
not
many
of
those
durham
and
yorkshire
lads
remain
alive
now
with
that
memory
the
few
who
do
must
have
thrust
it
out
of
their
vision
unless
at
night
it
haunts
them
the
assaulting
battalion
had
lost
many
men
during
the
assault
but
their
main
ordeal
came
after
the
first
advance
when
the
german
guns
belched
out
a
large
quantity
of
heavy
shells
from
the
direction
of
hill
they
raked
the
ground
and
tried
to
make
our
men
yield
the
position
they
had
gained
but
they
would
not
go
back
or
crawl
away
from
their
dead
all
through
the
day
the
bombardment
continued
answered
from
our
side
by
fourteen
hours
of
concentrated
fire
which
i
watched
from
our
battery
positions
in
spite
of
the
difficulties
of
getting
up
supplies
through
the
crumped
trenches
the
men
held
on
and
consolidated
their
positions
one
of
the
most
astounding
feats
was
done
by
the
sappers
who
put
up
barbed
wire
beyond
the
line
under
a
devilish
cannonade
a
telephone
operator
had
had
his
apparatus
smashed
by
a
shell
early
in
the
action
and
worked
his
way
back
to
get
another
he
succeeded
in
reaching
the
advanced
line
again
but
another
shell
knocked
out
his
second
instrument
it
was
then
only
possible
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
battalion
headquarters
by
means
of
messengers
and
again
and
again
officers
and
men
made
their
way
across
the
zone
of
fire
or
died
in
the
attempt
messages
reached
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
that
part
of
his
front
trenches
had
been
blown
away
from
other
parts
of
the
line
reports
came
in
that
the
enemy
was
preparing
a
for
several
hours
now
the
colonel
of
the
durhams
could
not
get
into
touch
with
his
companies
isolated
and
hidden
beneath
the
smoke
of
the
and
heliographing
were
out
of
the
question
he
could
not
tell
even
if
a
single
man
remained
alive
out
there
beneath
all
those
shells
no
word
came
from
them
now
to
let
him
know
if
the
enemy
were
early
in
the
afternoon
he
decided
to
go
out
and
make
his
own
reconnaissance
the
bombardment
was
still
relentless
and
it
was
only
possible
to
go
part
of
the
way
in
an
old
communication
trench
the
ground
about
was
littered
with
the
dead
still
being
blown
about
by
high
explosives
the
soul
of
the
colonel
was
heavy
then
with
doubt
and
with
the
knowledge
that
most
of
the
dead
here
were
his
own
when
he
told
me
this
adventure
his
only
comment
was
the
soldier
phrase
it
was
not
what
might
be
called
a
he
could
see
no
sign
of
a
but
straining
through
the
his
eyes
could
detect
no
sign
of
life
where
his
men
had
been
holding
the
captured
lines
were
they
all
dead
out
there
on
monday
night
the
colonel
was
told
that
his
battalion
would
be
relieved
and
managed
to
send
this
order
to
a
part
of
it
it
was
sent
through
by
various
routes
but
some
men
who
carried
it
came
back
with
the
news
that
it
was
still
impossible
to
get
into
touch
with
the
companies
holding
the
advanced
positions
above
the
menin
road
in
trying
to
do
so
they
had
had
astounding
escapes
several
of
them
had
been
blown
as
far
as
ten
yards
by
the
of
exploding
shells
and
had
been
buried
in
the
scatter
of
earth
when
at
last
my
men
came
back
those
of
them
who
had
received
the
order
said
the
colonel
i
knew
the
price
of
their
achievement
its
cost
in
officers
and
he
spoke
as
a
man
resentful
of
that
bloody
sacrifice
there
were
other
men
still
alive
and
still
holding
on
with
some
of
them
were
four
young
officers
who
clung
to
their
ground
all
through
the
next
night
before
being
relieved
they
were
without
a
drop
of
water
and
suffered
the
extreme
miseries
of
the
battlefield
there
was
no
distinction
in
courage
between
those
four
men
but
the
greater
share
of
suffering
was
borne
by
one
early
in
the
day
he
had
had
his
jaw
broken
by
a
piece
of
shell
but
still
led
his
men
later
in
the
day
he
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
leg
but
kept
his
command
and
he
was
still
leading
the
survivors
of
his
company
when
he
came
back
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
august
another
party
of
men
had
even
a
longer
time
of
trial
they
were
under
the
command
of
a
who
had
gained
possession
of
the
stables
above
the
menin
road
and
now
defended
their
ruins
during
the
previous
hours
he
had
managed
to
send
through
several
messages
but
they
were
not
to
report
his
exposed
position
nor
to
ask
for
supports
nor
to
request
relief
what
he
said
each
time
was
send
us
more
it
was
only
at
in
the
morning
of
tuesday
after
thirty
hours
under
that
the
survivors
came
away
from
their
rubbish
heap
in
the
lines
of
death
so
it
was
at
hooge
on
that
day
of
august
i
talked
with
these
men
touched
hands
with
them
while
the
mud
and
blood
of
the
business
still
fouled
them
even
now
in
remembrance
i
wonder
how
men
could
go
through
such
hours
without
having
on
their
faces
more
traces
of
their
hell
though
some
of
them
were
still
shaking
with
a
kind
of
ague
x
here
and
there
on
the
roadsides
behind
the
lines
queer
sacks
hung
from
wooden
poles
they
had
round
red
disks
painted
on
them
and
looked
like
the
trunks
of
human
bodies
after
red
indians
had
been
doing
decorative
work
with
their
enemy
slain
at
flixecourt
near
amiens
i
passed
one
on
a
sunday
when
bells
were
ringing
for
high
mass
and
a
crowd
of
young
soldiers
were
trooping
into
the
field
with
fixed
bayonets
a
friend
of
mine
an
ironical
fellow
nudged
me
and
said
for
young
christians
and
made
a
hideous
face
very
comical
it
was
a
of
instruction
and
o
bayonets
ronald
campbell
was
giving
a
little
demonstration
it
was
a
curiously
interesting
form
of
exercise
it
was
as
though
the
primitive
nature
in
man
which
had
been
sleeping
through
the
centuries
was
suddenly
awakened
in
the
souls
of
these
cockney
soldier
boys
they
made
sudden
jabs
at
one
another
fiercely
and
with
savage
grimaces
leaped
at
men
standing
with
their
backs
turned
who
wheeled
round
sharply
and
crossed
bayonets
and
taunted
the
attackers
then
they
lunged
at
the
hanging
sacks
stabbing
them
where
the
red
circles
were
painted
these
inanimate
things
became
revoltingly
lifelike
as
they
jerked
to
and
fro
and
the
bayonet
men
seemed
enraged
with
them
one
fell
from
the
rope
and
a
boy
sprang
at
it
dug
his
bayonet
in
put
his
foot
on
the
prostrate
thing
to
get
a
purchase
for
the
bayonet
which
he
lugged
out
again
and
then
kicked
the
sack
that
what
i
like
to
see
said
an
officer
there
a
fine
in
that
lad
he
kill
plenty
of
germans
before
ronald
campbell
was
a
great
lecturer
on
bayonet
exercise
he
curdled
the
blood
of
boys
with
his
eloquence
on
the
method
of
attack
to
pierce
liver
and
lights
and
kidneys
of
the
enemy
he
made
their
eyes
bulge
out
of
their
heads
fired
them
with
stoked
up
hatred
of
germans
all
in
a
quiet
earnest
persuasive
voice
and
a
sense
of
latent
power
and
passion
in
him
he
told
funny
stories
one
famous
in
the
army
called
where
it
was
the
story
of
an
attack
on
german
trenches
in
which
a
crowd
of
germans
were
captured
in
a
dugout
the
sergeant
had
been
told
to
blood
his
men
and
during
the
killing
he
turned
round
and
asked
a
go
was
a
timid
boy
who
shrank
from
butcher
work
but
he
was
called
up
and
given
his
man
to
kill
and
after
that
was
like
a
tiger
in
his
desire
for
german
blood
he
used
another
illustration
in
his
bayonet
lectures
you
may
meet
a
german
who
says
i
have
ten
kill
him
he
might
have
ten
at
those
of
british
youth
when
nature
was
averse
to
human
slaughter
until
very
scientifically
trained
one
might
see
every
form
of
instruction
in
every
kind
of
weapon
and
instrument
of
death
bombs
torpedoes
gas
and
later
on
tanks
and
as
the
months
passed
and
the
years
the
youth
of
the
british
empire
graduated
in
these
schools
of
war
and
those
who
lived
longest
were
experts
in
divers
branches
of
technical
education
ronald
campbell
retired
from
bayonet
instruction
and
devoted
his
genius
and
his
heart
which
was
bigger
than
the
point
of
a
bayonet
to
the
physical
instruction
of
the
army
and
the
recuperation
of
men
i
liked
him
better
in
that
job
and
saw
the
real
imagination
of
the
man
at
work
and
his
amazing
knowledge
of
psychology
when
men
came
down
from
the
trenches
dazed
sullen
stupid
dismal
broken
he
set
to
work
to
build
up
their
vitality
again
to
get
them
interested
in
life
again
and
to
make
them
keen
and
alert
as
they
had
been
dehumanized
by
war
so
he
rehumanized
them
by
natural
means
he
had
a
farm
with
flowers
and
vegetables
pigs
poultry
and
queer
beasts
a
tame
bear
named
flanagan
was
the
comic
character
of
the
camp
colonel
campbell
found
a
thousand
qualities
of
character
in
this
animal
and
brought
laughter
back
to
gloomy
boys
by
his
description
of
them
he
had
names
for
many
of
his
pets
the
and
the
and
he
taught
the
men
to
know
each
one
and
to
rear
chicks
and
tend
flowers
and
grow
vegetables
love
and
not
hate
was
now
his
gospel
all
his
training
was
done
by
games
simple
games
arousing
intelligence
leading
up
to
elaborate
games
demanding
skill
of
hand
and
eye
he
challenged
the
whole
army
system
of
discipline
imposed
by
authority
by
a
new
system
of
based
upon
interest
and
instinct
his
results
were
startling
and
men
who
had
been
dumb
dejected
wrecks
of
life
were
changed
quite
quickly
into
bright
cheery
fellows
with
laughter
in
their
eyes
it
a
pity
he
said
they
have
to
go
off
again
and
be
shot
to
pieces
i
cure
them
only
to
be
killed
but
that
not
my
fault
it
the
fault
of
it
was
colonel
campbell
who
discovered
willie
woodbine
the
fighting
parson
and
soldier
poet
who
was
the
leading
member
of
a
traveling
troupe
of
thugs
they
gave
pugilistic
entertainments
to
tired
men
each
of
them
had
one
thick
ear
willie
woodbine
had
two
they
fought
one
another
with
science
as
old
professionals
and
challenged
any
man
in
the
crowd
then
one
of
them
played
the
violin
and
drew
the
soul
out
of
soldiers
who
seemed
mere
animals
and
after
another
fight
willie
woodbine
stepped
up
and
talked
of
god
and
war
and
the
weakness
of
men
and
the
meaning
of
courage
he
held
all
those
fellows
in
his
hand
put
a
spell
on
them
kept
them
excited
by
a
new
revelation
gave
them
poor
devils
an
extra
touch
of
courage
to
face
the
menace
that
was
ahead
of
them
when
they
went
to
the
trenches
again
xi
our
men
were
not
always
in
the
trenches
as
the
new
army
grew
in
numbers
reliefs
were
more
frequent
than
in
the
old
days
when
battalions
held
the
line
for
long
spells
until
their
souls
as
well
as
their
bodies
were
sunk
in
squalor
now
in
the
summer
of
it
was
not
usual
for
men
to
stay
in
the
line
for
more
than
three
weeks
at
a
stretch
and
they
came
back
to
camps
and
billets
where
there
was
more
sense
of
life
though
still
the
chance
of
death
from
guns
farther
back
still
as
far
back
as
the
coast
and
all
the
way
between
the
sea
and
the
edge
of
war
there
were
new
battalions
quartered
in
french
and
flemish
villages
so
that
every
cottage
and
farmstead
villa
and
chateau
was
inhabited
by
men
in
khaki
who
made
themselves
at
home
and
established
friendly
relations
with
civilians
there
unless
they
were
too
flagrant
in
their
robbery
or
too
sour
in
their
temper
or
too
filthy
in
their
habits
generally
the
british
troops
were
popular
in
picardy
and
artois
and
when
they
left
women
kissed
and
cried
in
spite
of
laughter
and
joked
in
a
queer
jargon
of
in
the
estaminets
of
france
and
flanders
they
danced
with
frowzy
peasant
girls
to
the
tune
of
a
piano
or
failing
the
girls
danced
with
one
another
for
many
years
to
come
perhaps
for
centuries
those
cottages
and
barns
into
which
our
men
crowded
will
retain
signs
and
memories
of
that
british
occupation
in
the
great
war
boys
who
afterward
went
forward
to
the
and
stepped
across
the
line
to
the
world
of
ghosts
carved
their
names
on
wooden
beams
and
on
the
whitewashed
walls
scribbled
legends
proclaiming
that
private
john
johnson
was
a
bastard
or
that
a
certain
battalion
was
a
rabble
of
ruffians
or
that
kaiser
bill
would
die
on
the
gallows
illustrating
those
remarks
with
portraits
and
allegorical
devices
sketchily
drawn
but
vivid
and
significant
the
soldier
in
the
house
learned
quite
a
lot
of
french
with
which
he
made
his
needs
understood
by
the
elderly
woman
who
cooked
for
his
officers
mess
he
could
say
with
a
fine
fluency
ou
est
le
blooming
couteau
or
le
bally
fourchette
vous
plait
it
was
not
beyond
his
vocabulary
to
explain
that
les
pommes
de
terre
frites
are
absolument
all
right
if
only
madame
will
tenir
ses
cheveux
in
the
courtyards
of
ancient
farmhouses
so
old
in
their
timbers
and
gables
that
the
scottish
bodyguard
of
louis
xi
may
have
passed
them
on
their
way
to
paris
modern
scots
with
kilts
pumped
up
the
water
from
old
wells
and
whistled
i
know
a
lassie
to
the
girl
who
brought
the
cattle
home
and
munched
their
evening
rations
while
sandy
played
a
wee
bit
on
the
pipes
to
the
peasant
folk
who
gathered
at
the
gate
such
good
relations
existed
between
the
cottagers
and
their
temporary
guests
that
one
day
for
instance
when
a
young
friend
of
mine
came
back
from
a
long
spell
in
the
trenches
his
conversation
was
of
dead
men
flies
bombs
lice
and
hell
the
old
lady
who
had
given
him
her
best
bedroom
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
greeted
him
like
a
son
to
a
young
guardsman
with
his
undeveloped
mustache
on
his
upper
lip
her
demonstrations
were
embarrassing
it
was
one
of
the
paradoxes
of
the
war
that
beauty
lived
but
a
mile
or
two
away
from
hideous
squalor
while
men
in
the
lines
lived
in
dugouts
and
marched
down
communicating
trenches
after
rainy
weather
in
mud
and
water
and
suffered
the
beastliness
of
the
primitive
those
who
were
out
of
the
trenches
turn
and
turn
about
came
back
to
leafy
villages
and
drilled
in
fields
all
golden
with
buttercups
and
were
not
too
uncomfortable
in
spite
of
overcrowding
in
dirty
barns
there
was
more
than
comfort
in
some
of
the
headquarters
where
our
officers
were
billeted
in
french
chateaux
there
was
a
splendor
of
surroundings
which
gave
a
graciousness
and
elegance
to
the
daily
life
of
that
extraordinary
war
in
which
men
fought
as
brutally
as
in
prehistoric
times
i
knew
scores
of
such
places
and
went
through
gilded
gates
emblazoned
with
noble
coats
of
arms
belonging
to
the
days
of
the
sun
king
or
farther
back
to
the
valois
and
on
my
visits
to
generals
and
their
staffs
stood
on
long
flights
of
steps
which
led
up
to
old
mansions
with
many
towers
and
turrets
surrounded
by
noble
parks
and
ornamental
waters
and
deep
barns
in
which
five
centuries
of
harvests
had
been
stored
from
one
of
the
archways
here
one
might
see
in
the
eye
mme
de
pompadour
come
out
with
a
hawk
on
her
wrist
or
even
henri
de
navarre
with
his
all
their
plumes
alight
in
the
sun
as
they
mounted
their
horses
for
a
morning
it
was
surprising
at
first
when
a
young
british
officer
came
out
and
said
toppin
morning
or
any
news
from
the
dardanelles
there
was
something
incongruous
about
this
habitation
of
french
chiteaux
by
british
officers
with
their
the
strangeness
of
it
made
me
laugh
in
early
days
of
first
impressions
when
i
went
through
the
rooms
of
one
of
those
old
historic
houses
well
within
range
of
the
german
guns
with
a
brigade
major
it
was
the
chateau
de
henencourt
near
albert
this
is
the
general
bedroom
said
the
brigade
major
opening
a
door
which
led
off
a
gallery
in
which
many
beautiful
women
of
france
and
many
great
nobles
of
the
old
regime
looked
down
from
their
gilt
frames
the
general
had
a
nice
bed
to
sleep
in
in

levee
a

his
and

stood

and
puttees
at
night
the
staff
sat
down
to
dinner
in
a
salon
where
the
portraits
of
a
great
family
of
france
in
silks
and
satins
and
pompadour
wigs
looked
down
upon
their
khaki
the
owner
of
the
chateau
in
whose
veins
flowed
the
blood
of
those
old
aristocrats
was
away
with
his
regiment
in
which
he
held
the
rank
of
corporal
his
wife
the
comtesse
de
henencourt
managed
the
estate
from
which
all
the
except
the
veterans
had
been
mobilized
in
her
own
chateau
she
kept
one
room
for
herself
and
every
morning
came
in
from
the
dairies
where
she
had
been
working
with
her
maids
to
say
with
her
very
gracious
smile
to
the
invaders
of
her
house
bon

hid

she
had
under
the

poor

of
france
german
shells
came
to
knock
down
their
painted
turrets
to
smash
through
the
ceilings
where
the
rosy
cupids
played
and
in
one
hour
or
two
to
ruin
the
beauty
that
had
lived
through
centuries
of
pride
scores
of
them
along
the
line
of
battle
were
but
heaps
of
and
twisted
iron
i
saw
the
ruins
of
the
chateau
de
henencourt
two
years
after
my
first
visit
there
the
enemy
line
had
come
closer
to
it
and
it
was
a
target
for
their
guns
our
guns
heavy
and
light
were
firing
from
the
back
yard
and
neighboring
fields
with
deafening
tumult
shells
had
already
broken
the
roofs
and
turrets
of
the
chateau
and
torn
away
great
chunks
of
wall
a
colonel
of
artillery
had
his
headquarters
in
the
petit
salon
his
hand
trembled
as
he
greeted
me
i
not
fond
of
this
place
he
said
the
whole
damn
thing
will
come
down
on
my
head
at
any
time
i
think
i
shall
take
to
the
we
walked
out
to
the
courtyard
and
he
showed
me
the
way
down
to
the
vault
a
shell
came
over
the
chateau
and
burst
in
the
outhouses
they
knocked
out
a
a
little
while
ago
said
the
colonel
made
a
mess
of
some
heavy
there
was
a
sense
of
imminent
death
about
us
but
it
was
not
so
sinister
a
place
as
farther
on
where
a
brother
of
mine
sat
in
a
hole
directing
his
battery
the
countess
of
henencourt
had
gone
she
went
away
with
her
dairymaids
driving
her
cattle
down
the
roads
xii
one
of
the
most
curious
little
schools
of
courage
inhabited
by
british
soldiers
in
early
days
was
the
village
of
which
we
took
over
from
the
french
who
were
our
neighbors
at
the
village
of
frise
in
the
summer
of
after
the
foul
conditions
of
the
salient
it
seemed
unreal
and
fantastic
with
a
touch
of
romance
not
found
in
other
places
strange
as
it
seemed
the
village
garrisoned
by
our
men
was
in
advance
of
our
trench
lines
with
nothing
dividing
them
from
the
enemy
but
a
little
undergrowth
and
the
queerest
part
of
it
all
was
the
sense
of
safety
the
ridiculously
false
security
with
which
one
could
wander
about
the
village
and
up
the
footpath
beyond
with
the
knowledge
that
one
movements
were
being
watched
by
german
eyes
and
that
the
whole
place
could
be
blown
off
the
face
of
the
earth
but
for
the
convenient
fact
that
the
germans
who
were
living
in
the
village
of
curlu
beyond
the
footpath
were
under
our
own
observation
and
at
the
mercy
of
our
own
guns
that
sounded
like
a
to
men
who
in
other
places
could
not
go
over
the
parapet
of
the
trenches
or
even
put
their
heads
up
for
a
single
second
without
risking
instant
death
i
stood
on
a
hill
here
with
a
french
interpreter
and
one
of
his
men
a
battalion
of
loyal
north
lancashires
was
some
distance
away
but
after
an
exchange
of
compliments
in
an
idyllic
glade
where
a
party
of
french
soldiers
lived
in
the
friendliest
juxtaposition
with
the
british
infantry
surrounding
them
it
was
a
cheery
bivouac
among
the
trees
with
the
fragrance
of
a
mingling
with
the
odor
of
burning
wood
the
lieutenant
insisted
upon
leading
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
hill
he
made
a
slight
detour
to
point
out
a
german
shell
which
had
fallen
there
without
exploding
and
made
laughing
comments
upon
the
harmless
futile
character
of
those
poor
germans
in
front
of
us
they
did
their
best
to
kill
us
but
oh
so
feebly
yet
when
i
took
a
pace
toward
the
shell
he
called
out
sharply
ne
touchez
pas
i
would
rather
have
touched
a
sleeping
tiger
than
that
conical
piece
of
metal
with
its
unexploded
possibilities
but
bent
low
to
see
the
inscriptions
on
it
scratched
by
french
gunners
with
wore
recklessness
of
death
mort
aux
boches
was
scrawled
upon
it
between
the
men
initials
then
we
came
to
the
and
to
the
last
of
our
trenches
and
standing
there
looked
down
upon
the
villages
of
vaux
and
curlu
separated
by
a
piece
of
marshy
water
in
the
farthest
village
were
the
germans
and
in
the
nearest
just
below
us
down
the
steep
cliff
our
own
men
between
the
two
there
was
a
narrow
causeway
across
the
marsh
and
a
strip
of
woods
half
a
in
length
behind
in
a
sweeping
semicircle
round
their
village
and
ours
were
the
german
trenches
and
the
german
guns
i
looked
into
the
streets
of
both
villages
as
clearly
as
one
may
see
into
clovelly
village
from
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
a
few
british
soldiers
were
strolling
about
one
was
sitting
on
the
of
a
cottage
kicking
up
his
heels
in
the
german
village
of
curlu
the
roadways
were
concealed
by
the
perspective
of
the
houses
with
their
gables
and
so
that
i
could
not
see
any
passers
by
but
at
the
top
of
the
road
going
out
of
the
village
and
standing
outside
the
last
house
on
the
road
was
a
solitary
figure
a
german
sentry
the
french
lieutenant
pointed
to
a
thin
mast
away
from
the
village
on
the
hillside
do
you
see
that
that
is
their
flagstaff
they
hoist
their
flag
for
victories
it
wagged
a
good
deal
during
the
recent
russian
fighting
but
lately
they
have
not
had
the
cheek
to
put
it
this
interpreter
the
baron
de
rosen
laughed
very
heartily
at
that
naked
pole
on
the
hill
then
i
left
him
and
joined
our
own
men
and
went
down
a
steep
hill
into
vaux
well
outside
our
line
of
trenches
and
thrust
forward
as
an
outpost
in
the
marsh
german
eyes
could
see
me
as
i
walked
at
any
moment
those
little
houses
about
me
might
have
been
smashed
into
rubbish
heaps
but
no
shells
came
to
disturb
the
waterfowl
among
the
reeds
around
and
so
it
was
that
the
life
in
this
place
was
utterly
abnormal
and
while
the
guns
were
silent
except
for
long
range
fire
an
mode
of
war
what
the
adjutant
of
this
little
outpost
called
a
gentlemanly
warfare
prevailed
officers
and
men
slept
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
enemy
and
the
officers
wore
their
pajamas
at
night
when
a
fight
took
place
it
was
a
chivalrous
excursion
such
as
sir
walter
manny
would
have
liked
between
thirty
or
forty
men
on
one
side
against
somewhat
the
same
number
on
the
other
our
men
used
to
steal
out
along
the
causeway
which
crossed
the
marsh
a
pathway
about
four
feet
wide
broadening
out
in
the
middle
so
that
a
little
redoubt
or
blockhouse
was
established
there
then
across
a
narrow
drawbridge
then
along
the
path
again
until
they
came
to
the
thicket
which
screened
the
german
village
of
curlu
it
sometimes
happened
that
a
party
of
germans
were
creeping
forward
from
the
other
direction
in
just
the
same
way
disguised
in
clothes
splashed
with
greens
and
reds
and
browns
to
make
them
invisible
between
the
trees
with
brown
masks
over
their
faces
then
suddenly
contact
was
made
into
the
silence
of
the
wood
came
the
sharp
crack
of
rifles
the
of
bullets
the
shouts
of
men
who
had
given
up
the
game
of
invisibility
it
was
a
sharp
encounter
one
night
when
the
loyal
north
lancashires
held
the
village
of
vaux
and
our
men
brought
back
many
german
helmets
and
other
trophies
as
proofs
of
victory
then
to
bed
in
the
village
and
a
good
night
rest
as
when
english
knights
fought
the
french
not
far
from
these
fields
as
chronicled
in
the
pages
of
that
early
war
correspondent
sir
john
froissart
all
was
quiet
when
i
went
along
the
causeway
and
out
into
the
wood
where
the
outposts
stood
listening
for
any
crack
of
a
twig
which
might
betray
a
german
footstep
i
was
startled
when
i
came
suddenly
upon
two
men
almost
invisible
against
the
there
they
stood
motionless
with
their
rifles
ready
peering
through
the
brushwood
if
i
had
followed
the
path
on
which
they
stood
for
just
a
little
way
i
should
have
walked
into
the
german
village
but
on
the
other
hand
i
should
not
have
walked
back
again
when
i
left
the
village
and
climbed
up
the
hill
to
our
own
trenches
again
i
laughed
aloud
at
the
fantastic
visit
to
that
grim
little
outpost
in
the
marsh
if
all
the
war
had
been
like
this
it
would
have
been
more
endurable
for
men
who
had
no
need
to
hide
in
holes
in
the
earth
nor
crouch
for
three
months
below
ground
until
an
hour
or
two
of
massacre
below
a
storm
of
high
explosives
in
the
village
on
the
marsh
men
fought
at
least
against
other
men
and
not
against
invisible
powers
which
belched
forth
death
it
was
part
of
the
french
system
of
keeping
quiet
until
the
turn
of
big
offensives
a
good
system
to
my
mind
if
not
carried
too
far
at
frise
next
door
to
vaux
in
a
loop
of
the
somme
it
was
carried
a
little
too
far
with
relaxed
vigilance
it
was
a
joke
of
our
soldiers
to
crawl
on
and
through
the
reeds
and
enter
the
french
line
and
exchange
souvenirs
with
the
sentries
souvenir
said
one
of
them
one
day
bullet
you
know
cartouche
comprenny
a
french
poilu
of
territorials
who
had
been
dozing
sat
up
with
a
grin
and
said
mais
oui
mon
vieux
and
felt
in
his
pouch
for
a
cartridge
and
then
in
his
pockets
and
then
in
the
magazine
of
the
rifle
between
his
knees
fini
he
said
tout
fini
mon
the
germans
one
day
made
a
pounce
on
frise
that
little
village
in
the
loop
of
the
somme
and
pinched
every
man
of
the
french
garrison
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
and
i
heard
it
being
played
to
the
tune
of
the
french
slashing
over
the
trees
vaux
and
curlu
went
the
way
of
all
french
villages
in
the
zone
of
war
when
the
battles
of
the
somme
began
and
were
blown
off
the
map
xiii
at
a
place
called
the
pont
de
nieppe
beyond
armentieres
a
most
unhealthy
place
in
later
years
of
war
a
bathing
establishment
was
organized
by
officers
who
were
as
proud
of
their
work
as
though
they
had
brought
a
piece
of
paradise
to
flanders
to
be
fair
to
them
they
had
done
that
to
any
interested
visitor
understanding
the
nobility
of
their
work
they
exhibited
a
curious
relic
it
was
the
holy
shirt
of
nieppe
which
should
be
treasured
as
a
memorial
in
our
war
museum
an
of
what
the
great
war
meant
to
men
it
was
not
a
saint
shirt
but
had
been
worn
by
a
british
officer
in
the
trenches
and
was
like
tens
of
thousands
of
other
shirts
worn
by
our
officers
and
men
in
the
first
winters
of
the
war
neither
better
nor
worse
but
a
fair
average
specimen
it
had
been
framed
in
a
glass
case
and
revealed
on
its
linen
the
corpses
of
thousands
of
lice
that
vermin
swarmed
upon
the
bodies
of
all
our
boys
who
went
into
the
trenches
and
tortured
them
after
three
days
they
were
lousy
from
head
to
foot
after
three
weeks
they
were
walking
menageries
to
english
boys
from
clean
homes
to
young
officers
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
religion
of
the
morning
tub
this
was
one
of
the
worst
horrors
of
war
they
were
disgusted
with
themselves
their
own
bodies
were
revolting
to
them
scores
of
times
i
have
seen
battalions
of
men
just
out
of
battle
stripping
themselves
and
hunting
in
their
shirts
for
the
foul
beast
they
had
a
technical
name
for
this
hunter
job
they
called
it
they
desired
a
bath
as
the
hart
panteth
for
the
water
brooks
and
baths
were
but
a
mirage
of
the
brain
to
men
in
flanders
fields
and
beyond
the
somme
until
here
and
there
as
at
nieppe
officers
with
human
sympathy
organized
a
system
by
which
battalions
of
men
could
wash
their
bodies
the
place
in
nieppe
had
been
a
and
there
were
big
tubs
in
the
sheds
and
nearby
was
the
water
of
the
lys
boilers
were
set
going
to
heat
the
water
a
battalion
shirts
were
put
into
an
oven
and
the
lice
were
baked
and
killed
it
was
a
splendid
thing
to
see
scores
of
boys
wallowing
in
those
big
tubs
six
in
a
tub
with
a
bit
of
soap
for
each
they
gave
little
grunts
and
shouts
of
joyous
satisfaction
the
cleansing
water
the
liquid
heat
made
their
flesh
tingle
with
exquisite
delight
sensuous
and
spiritual
they
were
like
children
they
splashed
one
another
with
gurgles
of
laughter
they
put
their
heads
under
water
and
came
up
puffing
and
blowing
like
grampuses
something
broke
in
heart
to
see
them
those
splendid
boys
whose
bodies
might
soon
be
torn
to
tatters
by
chunks
of
steel
one
of
them
remembered
a
bit
of
latin
he
had
sung
at
stonyhurst
asperges
me
domine
hyssopo
et
mundabor
lavabis
me
et
super
nivem
thou
shalt
sprinkle
me
with
hyssop
o
lord
and
i
shall
be
cleansed
thou
shalt
wash
me
and
i
shall
be
made
whiter
than
on
the
other
side
of
the
lines
the
germans
were
suffering
in
the
same
way
lousy
also
and
they
too
were
organizing
after
their
first
retreat
i
saw
a
queer
name
on
a
wooden
shed
entlausunganstalt
i
puzzled
over
it
a
moment
and
then
understood
it
was
a
new
word
created
out
of
the
dirt
of
modern
war
delousing
xiv
it
was
in
the
summer
of
and
death
was
not
the
only
reaper
who
went
about
the
fields
although
he
was
busy
and
did
not
rest
even
when
the
sun
had
flamed
down
below
the
belt
of
trees
on
the
far
ridge
and
left
the
world
in
darkness
on
a
night
in
august
two
of
us
stood
in
a
cornfield
silent
under
the
great
dome
staring
up
at
the
startling
splendor
of
it
the
red
ball
just
showed
above
the
far
line
of
single
trees
which
were
black
as
charcoal
on
the
edge
of
a
long
straight
road
two
miles
away
and
from
its
furnace
there
were
flung
a
million
feathers
of
flame
against
the
canopy
of
the
evening
sky
the
burning
colors
died
out
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
fields
darkened
and
all
the
paled
until
they
became
quite
white
like
rows
of
tents
under
the
harvest
moon
another
night
had
come
in
this
year
of
war
up
ypres
way
the
guns
were
busy
and
at
regular
intervals
the
earth
trembled
and
the
air
vibrated
with
dull
thunderous
shocks
the
moon
face
looks
full
of
irony
said
the
man
by
my
side
it
seems
to
say
fools
those
creatures
are
down
there
spoiling
their
with
such
a
mess
of
blood
the
stars
were
very
bright
in
some
of
those
flemish
nights
i
saw
the
milky
way
clearly
tracked
across
the
dark
desert
the
pleiades
and
orion
belt
were
like
diamonds
on
black
velvet
but
among
all
these
worlds
of
light
other
stars
unknown
to
astronomers
appeared
and
disappeared
on
the
road
back
from
a
french
town
one
night
i
looked
arras
way
and
saw
what
seemed
a
bursting
planet
it
fell
with
a
scatter
of
burning
pieces
then
suddenly
the
thick
cloth
of
the
night
was
rent
with
stabs
of
light
as
though
flashing
swords
were
hacking
it
and
a
moment
later
a
finger
of
white
fire
was
traced
along
the
black
edge
of
the
woods
so
that
the
whole
sky
was
brightened
for
a
moment
and
then
was
blotted
out
by
a
deeper
darkness
arras
was
being
shelled
again
as
i
saw
it
many
times
in
those
long
years
of
war
the
darkness
of
all
the
towns
in
the
war
zone
was
rather
horrible
their
strange
intense
quietude
when
the
guns
were
not
at
work
made
them
dead
as
the
very
spirit
of
a
town
dies
on
the
edge
of
war
one
night
as
on
many
others
i
walked
through
one
of
them
with
a
friend
every
house
was
shuttered
and
hardly
a
gleam
came
through
any
crack
no
footstep
save
our
own
told
of
life
the
darkness
was
almost
palpable
it
seemed
to
press
against
one
eyeballs
like
a
velvet
mask
my
nerves
were
so
on
edge
with
a
sense
of
the
uncanny
silence
and
invisibility
that
i
started
violently
at
the
sound
of
a
quiet
voice
speaking
three
inches
from
my
ear
halte
qui
va
la
it
was
a
french
sentry
who
stood
with
his
back
to
the
wall
of
a
house
in
such
a
gulf
of
blackness
that
not
even
his
bayonet
was
revealed
by
a
glint
another
day
of
war
came
the
old
beauty
of
the
world
was
there
close
to
the
lines
of
the
bronzed
cornfields
splashed
with
the
scarlet
of
poppies
and
the
pale
yellow
of
the
newly
cut
sheaves
stretching
away
and
away
without
the
break
of
a
hedge
to
the
last
slopes
which
met
the
sky
i
stood
in
some
of
those
staring
across
to
a
slope
of
rising
ground
where
there
was
no
ripening
wheat
and
where
the
grass
itself
came
to
a
sudden
halt
as
though
afraid
of
something
i
knew
the
reason
of
this
and
of
the
long
white
lines
of
earth
thrown
up
for
miles
each
way
those
were
the
parapets
of
german
trenches
and
in
the
ditches
below
them
were
armed
with
deadly
weapons
staring
out
across
the
beauty
of
france
and
wondering
perhaps
why
they
should
be
there
to
mar
it
and
watching
me
a
little
black
dot
in
their
range
of
vision
with
an
idle
thought
as
to
whether
it
were
worth
their
while
to
let
a
bullet
loose
and
end
my
walk
they
could
have
done
so
easily
but
did
not
bother
no
shot
or
shell
came
to
break
through
the
hum
of
bees
or
to
crash
through
the
sigh
of
the
wind
which
was
bending
all
the
ears
of
corn
to
listen
to
the
murmurous
in
these
fields
of
france
close
to
me
was
a
group
of
peasants
a
study
for
a
painter
like
millet
one
of
them
shouted
out
to
me
voilà
les
boches
waving
his
arm
to
left
and
right
and
then
shaking
a
clenched
fist
at
them
a
sturdy
girl
with
a
brown
throat
showing
through
an
open
bodice
munched
an
apple
like
audrey
in
as
you
like
it
and
between
her
bites
told
me
that
she
had
had
a
brother
killed
in
the
war
and
that
she
had
been
nearly
killed
herself
a
week
ago
by
shells
that
came
bursting
all
round
her
as
she
was
tying
up
her
sheaves
she
pointed
to
great
holes
in
the
field
and
described
the
coming
of
the
germans
into
her
village
over
there
when
she
had
lied
to
some
uhlans
about
the
whereabouts
of
french
soldiers
and
had
given
one
of
those
fat
germans
a
blow
on
the
face
when
he
had
tried
to
make
love
to
her
in
her
father
barn
her
mother
had
been
raped
in
further
fields
out
of
view
of
the
german
trenches
but
well
within
the
harvesting
was
being
done
by
french
soldiers
one
of
them
was
driving
the
reaping
machine
and
looked
like
a
gunner
on
his
limber
with
his
kepi
thrust
to
the
back
of
his
head
the
trousers
of
his
comrades
were
as
red
as
the
poppies
that
grew
on
the
edge
of
the
wheat
and
three
of
these
poilus
had
ceased
their
work
to
drink
out
of
a
leather
which
had
been
replenished
from
a
it
was
a
pretty
scene
if
one
could
forget
the
grim
purpose
which
had
put
those
harvesters
in
uniform
the
same
thought
was
in
the
mind
of
a
british
officer
a
beautiful
country
this
he
said
it
a
pity
to
cut
it
up
with
trenches
and
barbed
battalions
of
new
army
men
were
being
reviewed
but
a
furlong
or
two
away
from
that
invisible
man
who
was
wielding
a
scythe
which
had
no
mercy
for
unripe
wheat
out
of
those
lines
of
eyes
stared
the
courage
of
souls
not
shirking
the
next
ordeal
it
was
through
red
ears
of
corn
in
that
summer
of
that
one
found
one
way
to
many
of
the
trenches
that
marked
the
of
the
year
harvesting
and
in
belgium
by
kemmel
hill
the
shells
of
our
batteries
answered
by
german
guns
came
with
their
howls
of
murder
across
the
heads
of
peasant
women
who
were
gleaning
with
bent
backs
in
plug
street
wood
the
trees
had
worn
thin
under
showers
of
shrapnel
but
the
long
avenues
between
the
trenches
were
cool
and
pleasant
in
the
heat
of
the
day
it
was
one
of
the
elementary
schools
where
many
of
our
soldiers
learned
the
a
b
c
of
actual
warfare
after
their
training
in
camps
behind
the
lines
here
one
might
sport
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
but
for
the
fact
that
country
wenches
were
not
allowed
in
the
dugouts
and
trenches
where
i
found
our
soldiers
killing
flies
in
the
intervals
between
at
german
periscopes
the
enemy
was
engaged
presumably
in
the
same
pursuit
of
killing
time
and
life
with
luck
and
sniping
was
hot
on
both
sides
so
that
the
wood
resounded
with
sharp
reports
as
though
hard
filbert
nuts
were
being
cracked
by
giant
teeth
each
time
i
went
there
one
of
our
men
was
hit
by
a
sniper
and
his
body
was
carried
off
for
burial
as
i
went
toward
the
first
line
of
trenches
hoping
that
my
shadow
would
not
fall
across
a
german
periscope
the
sight
of
that
dead
body
passing
chilled
one
a
little
there
were
many
graves
in
the
bosky
arbors
eighteen
under
one
mound
but
some
of
those
who
had
fallen
six
months
before
still
lay
where
the
gleaners
could
not
reach
them
i
used
to
peer
through
the
leaves
of
plug
street
wood
at
no
man
land
between
the
lines
where
every
creature
had
been
killed
by
the
sweeping
flail
of
and
shrapnel
along
the
there
were
many
barren
territories
like
that
and
up
by
hooge
along
the
edge
of
the
fatal
crater
and
behind
the
stripped
trees
of
zouave
wood
there
was
no
other
gleaning
to
be
had
but
that
of
broken
shells
and
shrapnel
bullets
and
a
litter
of
limbs
xv
for
some
time
the
war
office
would
not
allow
military
bands
at
the
front
not
understanding
that
music
was
like
water
to
parched
souls
by
degrees
divisional
generals
realized
the
utter
need
of
entertainment
among
men
dulled
and
dazed
by
the
routine
of
war
and
encouraged
variety
shows
organized
by
young
officers
who
had
been
amateur
actors
before
the
war
who
searched
around
for
likely
talent
there
was
plenty
of
it
in
the
new
army
including
professional
funny
men
trick
cyclists
conjurers
and
singers
of
all
kinds
so
by
the
summer
of
most
of
the
divisions
had
their
dramatic
entertainments
the
follies
the
bow
bells
the
jocks
the
the
the
diamonds
the
brass
hats
the
verey
lights
and
many
others
with
fancy
names
i
remember
going
to
one
of
the
first
of
them
in
the
village
of
acheux
a
few
miles
from
the
german
lines
it
was
held
in
an
old
and
i
shall
long
remember
the
impressions
of
the
place
with
seven
or
eight
hundred
men
sitting
in
the
gloom
of
that
big
broken
building
where
strange
bits
of
machinery
looked
through
the
darkness
and
where
through
gashes
in
the
walls
stars
twinkled
there
was
a
smell
of
clay
and
moist
sugar
and
tarpaulins
and
damp
khaki
and
chloride
of
lime
very
pungent
in
one
nostrils
and
when
the
curtain
went
up
on
a
well
fitted
stage
and
the
follies
began
their
performance
the
squalor
of
the
place
did
not
matter
what
mattered
was
the
enormous
whimsicality
of
the
bombardier
at
the
piano
and
the
outrageous
comicality
of
a
soldier
with
a
red
nose
who
described
how
he
had
run
away
from
mons
with
the
rest
of
you
and
the
light
heartedness
of
a
performance
which
could
have
gone
straight
to
a
london
and
brought
down
the
house
with
jokes
and
songs
made
up
in
dugouts
and
front
line
trenches
at
first
the
audience
sat
silent
with
glazed
eyes
it
was
difficult
to
get
a
laugh
out
of
them
the
mud
of
the
trenches
was
still
on
them
they
stank
of
the
trenches
and
the
stench
was
in
their
souls
presently
they
began
to
brighten
up
life
came
back
into
their
eyes
they
laughed
later
from
this
audience
of
soldiers
there
were
yells
of
laughter
though
the
effect
of
shells
arriving
at
unexpected
moments
in
untoward
circumstances
was
a
favorite
theme
of
the
jesters
many
of
the
men
were
going
into
the
trenches
that
night
again
and
there
would
be
no
fun
in
the
noise
of
the
shells
but
they
went
more
gaily
and
with
stronger
hearts
i
am
sure
because
of
the
laughter
which
had
roared
through
the
old
sugar
factory
a
night
or
two
later
i
went
to
another
concert
and
heard
the
same
gaiety
of
men
who
had
been
through
a
year
of
war
it
was
in
an
open
field
under
a
velvety
sky
studded
with
innumerable
stars
nearly
a
thousand
soldiers
trooped
through
the
gates
and
massed
before
the
little
canvas
theater
in
front
a
small
crowd
of
flemish
children
squatted
on
the
grass
not
understanding
a
word
of
the
jokes
but
laughing
in
shrill
delight
at
the
antics
of
the
was
a
funny
fellow
and
his
with
a
stout
flemish
woman
round
the
flap
of
the
canvas
screen
to
whom
he
made
amorous
advances
while
his
comrades
were
singing
sentimental
ballads
was
truly
comic
the
hit
of
the
evening
was
when
an
australian
behind
the
stage
gave
an
unexpected
imitation
of
a
there
was
something
indescribably
weird
and
wild
and
grotesque
in
that
prolonged
cry
of
cackling
unnatural
mirth
an
australian
by
my
side
said
well
done
exactly
right
and
the
flemish
children
shrieked
with
joy
without
understanding
the
meaning
of
the
noise
old
old
songs
belonging
to
the
early
victorian
age
were
given
by
the
soldiers
who
had
great
emotion
and
broke
down
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
a
verse
there
were
funny
men
dressed
in
the
widow
twankey
style
or
in
burlesque
uniforms
who
were
greeted
with
yells
of
laughter
by
their
comrades
an
australian
giant
played
some
clever
card
tricks
and
another
australian
recited
kipling
gunga
din
with
splendid
fire
and
between
every
turn
the
soldiers
in
the
field
roared
out
a
chorus
jolly
good
song
jolly
well
sung
if
you
can
think
of
a
better
welcome
to
try
but
do
forget
the
singer
is
dry
give
the
poor
beggar
some
beer
a
touring
company
of
musicians
was
having
a
great
success
in
the
war
zone
but
apart
from
all
those
organized
methods
of
mirth
there
was
a
funny
man
in
every
billet
who
played
the
part
of
court
jester
and
clowned
it
whatever
the
state
of
the
weather
or
the
risks
of
war
the
british
soldier
would
have
his
game
of
house
or
crown
and
anchor
even
on
the
edge
of
the
and
his
little
bit
of
sport
wherever
there
was
room
to
stretch
his
legs
it
was
a
jesting
army
though
some
of
its
jokes
were
very
grim
and
those
who
saw
as
i
did
the
daily
tragedy
of
war
never
ceasing
always
adding
to
the
sum
of
human
suffering
were
not
likely
to
discourage
that
sense
of
humor
a
successful
concert
with
combs
and
and
penny
whistles
was
given
by
the
guards
in
the
trenches
near
loos
they
played
old
english
melodies
harmonized
with
great
emotion
and
technical
skill
it
attracted
an
unexpected
audience
the
germans
crowded
into
their
front
line
not
far
away
and
applauded
each
number
presently
in
good
english
a
german
voice
shouted
across
play
laurie
and
i
will
sing
the
guards
played
annie
laurie
and
a
german
officer
stood
up
on
the
parapet
the
evening
sun
was
red
behind
him
and
sang
the
old
song
admirably
with
great
tenderness
there
was
applause
on
both
sides
let
have
another
concert
shouted
the
germans
but
there
was
a
different
kind
of
concert
next
day
and
the
music
was
played
by
mills
bombs
and
other
instruments
of
death
in
possession
of
the
guards
there
were
cries
of
agony
and
terror
from
the
german
trenches
and
young
officers
of
the
guards
told
the
story
as
an
amusing
anecdote
with
loud
laughter
xvi
it
was
astonishing
how
loudly
one
laughed
at
tales
of
gruesome
things
of
war
with
the
rest
of
them
i
think
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
a
sense
of
the
ironical
contrast
between
the
normal
ways
of
civilian
life
and
this
to
the
caveman
code
it
made
all
our
old
philosophy
of
life
monstrously
ridiculous
it
played
the
hat
trick
with
the
gentility
of
modern
manners
men
who
had
been
brought
up
to
christian
virtues
who
had
prattled
their
little
prayers
at
knees
who
had
grown
up
to
a
love
of
poetry
painting
music
the
gentle
arts
to
the
subtleties
of
delicate
scales
of
emotion
fastidious
in
their
choice
of
words
in
their
sense
of
beauty
found
themselves
compelled
to
live
and
act
like
and
it
was
abominably
funny
they
laughed
at
the
most
frightful
episodes
which
revealed
this
contrast
between
civilized
ethics
and
the
old
beast
law
the
more
revolting
it
was
the
more
sometimes
they
shouted
with
laughter
especially
in
reminiscence
when
the
tale
was
told
in
the
gilded
salon
of
a
french
chateau
or
at
a
it
was
i
think
the
laughter
of
mortals
at
the
trick
which
had
been
played
on
them
by
an
ironical
fate
they
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
the
whole
object
of
life
was
to
reach
out
to
beauty
and
love
and
that
mankind
in
its
progress
to
perfection
had
killed
the
beast
instinct
cruelty
the
primitive
savage
law
of
survival
by
tooth
and
claw
and
club
and
ax
all
poetry
all
art
all
religion
had
preached
this
gospel
and
this
promise
now
that
ideal
had
broken
like
a
china
vase
dashed
to
hard
ground
the
contrast
between
that
and
this
was
devastating
it
was
in
an
enormous
way
like
a
highly
dignified
man
in
a
silk
hat
morning
coat
creased
trousers
spats
and
patent
boots
suddenly
slipping
on
a
piece
of
and
sitting
all
of
a
heap
with
silk
hat
flying
in
a
filthy
gutter
the
humor
of
the
soul
roared
with
mirth
at
the
sight
of
all
that
dignity
and
elegance
despoiled
so
we
laughed
merrily
i
remember
when
a
military
chaplain
eton
christ
church
and
christian
service
described
how
an
english
sergeant
stood
round
the
traverse
of
a
german
trench
in
a
night
raid
and
as
the
germans
came
his
way
thinking
to
escape
he
cleft
one
skull
after
another
with
a
bludgeon
a
weapon
which
he
had
made
with
loving
craftsmanship
on
the
model
of
blunderbore
club
in
the
pictures
of
a
so
we
laughed
at
the
adventures
of
a
young
barrister
a
brilliant
fellow
in
the
oxford
union
whose
pleasure
it
was
to
creep
out
o
nights
into
no
man
land
and
lie
doggo
in
a
close
to
the
enemy
barbed
wire
until
presently
after
an
hour
waiting
or
two
a
german
soldier
would
crawl
out
to
fetch
in
a
corpse
the
english
barrister
lay
with
his
rifle
ready
where
there
had
been
one
corpse
there
were
two
each
night
he
made
a
notch
on
his
rifle
three
notches
one
night
to
check
the
number
of
his
victims
then
he
came
back
to
breakfast
in
his
dugout
with
a
hearty
appetite
in
one
section
of
trenches
the
men
made
a
habit
of
betting
upon
those
who
would
be
wounded
first
it
had
all
the
uncertainty
of
the
one
day
when
the
german
gunners
were
putting
over
a
special
dose
of
hate
a
sergeant
kept
coming
to
one
dugout
to
inquire
about
a
new
chum
who
had
come
up
with
the
drafts
is
private
smith
all
right
he
asked
yes
sergeant
he
all
right
answered
the
men
crouching
in
the
dark
hole
private
smith
is
wounded
yet
asked
the
sergeant
again
five
minutes
later
no
private
smith
was
touched
by
this
interest
in
his
that
sergeant
seems
a
very
kind
man
said
the
boy
seems
to
love
me
like
a
father
a
yell
of
laughter
answered
him
you
poor
bleeding
fool
said
one
of
his
comrades
he
drawn
you
in
a
lottery
stood
to
win
if
you
been
in
digging
new
trenches
and
new
dugouts
bodies
and
bits
of
bodies
were
unearthed
and
put
into
with
the
soil
that
was
sent
back
down
a
line
of
men
concealing
their
work
from
german
eyes
waiting
for
any
new
activity
in
our
ditches
bit
of
bill
said
the
leading
man
putting
in
a
leg
another
bit
of
bill
he
said
unearthing
a
hand
bill
ugly
mug
he
said
at
a
later
stage
in
the
operations
when
a
head
was
found
as
told
afterward
that
little
episode
in
the
trenches
seemed
immensely
comic
generals
chuckled
over
it
chaplains
treasured
it
how
we
used
to
guffaw
at
the
answer
of
the
cockney
soldier
who
met
a
german
soldier
with
his
hands
up
crying
kamerad
kamerad
mercy
not
so
much
of
your
kamerad
said
the
cockney
us
over
your
bloody
ticker
it
was
the
man
watch
he
wanted
without
sentiment
one
tale
was
most
popular
most
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
where
your
prisoner
asked
an
intelligence
officer
waiting
to
receive
a
german
sent
down
from
the
trenches
under
escort
of
an
honest
corporal
i
lost
him
on
the
way
sir
said
the
corporal
lost
him
the
corporal
was
embarrassed
very
sorry
sir
my
feelings
overcame
me
sir
it
was
like
this
sir
the
man
started
talking
on
the
way
down
said
he
was
thinking
of
his
poor
wife
i
been
thinking
of
mine
and
i
felt
sorry
for
him
then
he
mentioned
as
how
he
had
two
kiddies
at
home
i
two
kiddies
at
sir
and
i
could
feeling
sorry
for
him
then
he
said
as
how
his
old
mother
had
died
awhile
ago
and
he
never
see
her
again
when
he
started
cryin
i
was
so
sorry
for
him
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
sir
so
i
killed
the
poor
our
men
in
the
trenches
and
out
of
them
up
to
the
waist
in
water
sometimes
lying
in
slimy
dugouts
lice
eaten
on
the
edge
of
under
harassing
fire
with
just
the
fluke
of
luck
between
life
and
death
seized
upon
any
kind
of
joke
as
an
excuse
for
laughter
and
many
a
time
in
ruins
and
in
trenches
and
in
dugouts
i
have
heard
great
laughter
it
was
the
protective
armor
of
men
souls
they
knew
that
if
they
did
not
laugh
their
courage
would
go
and
nothing
would
stand
between
them
and
fear
you
know
sir
said
a
one
day
when
i
walked
with
him
down
a
communication
trench
so
waterlogged
that
my
were
full
of
slime
it
does
do
to
take
this
war
and
as
though
in
answer
to
him
a
soldier
without
breeches
and
with
his
shirt
tied
between
his
legs
looked
at
me
and
remarked
in
a
philosophical
way
with
just
a
glint
of
comedy
in
his
eyes
that
there
grand
fleet
of
ours
do
seem
to
be
very
active
sir
a
pity
it
do
come
down
these
blinkin
trenches
and
do
a
bit
of
work
having
a
my
man
said
a
brigadier
to
a
soldier
trying
to
wash
in
a
basin
about
the
size
of
a
kitchen
mug
yes
sir
said
the
man
and
i
wish
i
was
a
blasted
one
of
the
most
remarkable
battles
on
the
front
was
fought
by
a
battalion
of
worcesters
for
the
benefit
of
two
english
members
of
parliament
it
was
not
a
very
big
battle
but
most
dramatic
while
it
lasted
the
colonel
who
had
a
sense
of
humor
arranged
it
after
a
telephone
message
to
his
dugout
telling
him
that
two
politicians
were
about
to
visit
his
battalion
in
the
line
and
asking
him
to
show
them
something
interesting
interesting
said
the
colonel
do
they
think
this
war
is
a
for
politicians
do
they
want
me
to
arrange
a
massacre
to
make
a
london
holiday
then
his
voice
changed
and
he
laughed
show
them
something
interesting
oh
all
right
i
dare
say
i
can
do
he
did
when
the
two
arrived
apparently
at
the
trenches
they
were
informed
by
the
colonel
that
much
to
his
regret
for
their
sake
the
enemy
was
just
attacking
and
that
his
men
were
defending
their
position
desperately
we
hope
for
the
best
he
said
and
i
think
there
is
just
a
chance
that
you
will
escape
with
your
lives
if
you
stay
here
quite
great
god
said
one
of
the
and
the
other
was
silent
but
pale
certainly
there
was
all
the
noise
of
a
big
attack
the
worcesters
were
on
the
firing
rifle
grenades
and
throwing
bombs
with
terrific
energy
every
now
and
then
a
man
fell
and
the
pounced
on
him
tied
him
up
in
bandages
and
carried
him
away
to
the
field
whistling
as
they
went
we
wo
go
home
till
morning
in
a
most
heroic
way
the
battle
lasted
twenty
minutes
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
colonel
announced
to
his
visitors
the
attack
is
repulsed
and
you
gentlemen
have
nothing
more
to
one
of
the
was
thrilled
with
excitement
the
valor
of
your
men
was
marvelous
he
said
what
impressed
me
most
was
the
cheerfulness
of
the
wounded
they
were
actually
grinning
as
they
came
down
on
the
the
colonel
grinned
too
in
fact
he
stifled
a
fit
of
coughing
funny
devils
he
said
they
are
so
glad
to
be
going
the
members
of
parliament
went
away
enormously
impressed
but
they
had
not
enjoyed
themselves
nearly
as
well
as
the
worcesters
who
had
fought
a
sham
battle
not
in
the
trenches
but
in
the
support
trenches
two
miles
back
they
laughed
for
a
week
afterward
xvii
on
the
hill
at
wizerne
not
far
from
the
stately
old
town
of
visited
from
time
to
time
by
monstrous
nightbirds
who
dropped
eggs
was
a
large
convent
there
were
no
nuns
there
but
generally
some
hundreds
of
young
officers
and
men
from
many
different
battalions
attending
a
course
under
the
direction
of
general
who
was
the
master
of
the
british
army
at
a
time
when
we
were
very
weak
in
those
weapons
compared
with
the
enemy
strength
and
a
cheery
vital
man
this
war
has
produced
two
great
dugouts
said
lord
kitchener
on
a
visit
to
the
convent
me
and
it
was
the
boys
who
interested
me
more
than
the
machines
i
was
never
much
interested
in
the
machinery
of
war
they
came
down
from
the
trenches
to
this
school
with
a
sense
of
escape
from
prison
and
for
the
ten
days
of
their
course
they
were
like
freshers
at
oxford
and
made
the
most
of
their
minutes
organizing
concerts
and
other
entertainments
in
the
evenings
after
their
initiation
into
the
mysteries
of
vickers
and
lewis
i
was
invited
to
dinner
there
one
night
and
sat
between
two
young
cavalry
officers
on
long
benches
crowded
with
subalterns
of
many
regiments
it
was
a
merry
meal
and
a
good
one
to
this
day
i
remember
a
potato
pie
gloriously
baked
and
afterward
as
it
was
the
last
night
of
the
course
all
the
officers
went
wild
and
indulged
in
a
rag
of
the
kind
they
straddled
across
the
benches
and
barged
at
each
other
in
single
tourneys
and
jousts
riding
their
with
violent
rearings
and
plungings
and
bruising
one
another
without
grievous
hurt
and
with
yells
of
laughter
glasses
broke
crockery
crashed
upon
the
polished
boards
one
boy
danced
the
highland
fling
on
the
tables
others
were
waltzing
down
the
corridors
there
was
a
rugby
scrum
in
the
refectory
and
cried
the
view
halloo
and
shouted
yoicks
yoicks
general
was
a
human
soul
and
kept
to
his
own
room
that
night
and
let
discipline
go
hang
when
the
battles
of
the
somme
began
it
was
those
young
officers
who
led
their
sections
into
the
woods
of
death
belville
wood
mametz
wood
high
wood
and
the
others
it
was
they
who
afterward
held
the
outpost
lines
in
flanders
some
of
them
were
still
alive
on
march
when
they
were
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
germans
and
fought
until
the
last
in
isolated
redoubts
north
and
south
of
two
of
them
are
still
alive
those
between
whom
i
sat
at
dinner
that
night
and
who
escaped
many
close
calls
of
death
before
the
armistice
of
the
others
who
charged
one
another
with
wooden
benches
their
laughter
ringing
out
some
were
blown
to
bits
and
some
were
buried
alive
and
some
were
blinded
and
gassed
and
some
went
missing
for
evermore
xviii
in
those
long
days
of
trench
warfare
and
stationary
lines
it
was
boredom
that
was
the
worst
malady
of
the
mind
a
large
overwhelming
boredom
to
thousands
of
men
who
were
in
exile
from
the
normal
interests
of
life
and
from
the
activities
of
an
intolerable
abominable
boredom
sapping
the
the
moral
code
the
intellect
a
boredom
from
which
there
seemed
no
escape
except
by
death
no
relief
except
by
vice
no
probable
or
possible
change
in
its
dreary
routine
it
was
bad
enough
in
the
trenches
where
men
looked
across
the
parapet
to
the
same
corner
of
hell
day
by
day
to
the
same
dead
bodies
rotting
by
the
edge
of
the
same
to
the
same
old
in
the
enemy
line
to
the
blasted
tree
sliced
by
the
upturned
railway
truck
of
which
only
the
metal
remained
the
distant
fringe
of
trees
like
gallows
on
the
the
broken
spire
of
a
church
which
could
be
seen
in
the
round
o
of
the
telescope
when
the
weather
was
not
too
misty
in
quiet
sections
of
the
line
the
only
variation
to
the
routine
was
the
number
of
casualties
day
by
day
by
casual
or
snipers
bullets
and
that
became
part
of
the
boredom
what
casualties
asked
the
adjutant
in
his
dugout
two
killed
three
wounded
very
well
you
can
a
salute
in
the
doorway
of
the
dugout
a
groan
from
the
adjutant
lighting
another
cigarette
leaning
with
his
elbow
on
the
deal
table
staring
at
the
guttering
of
the
candle
by
his
side
at
the
pile
of
forms
in
front
of
him
at
the
glint
of
light
on
the
steel
helmet
hanging
by
its
strap
on
a
nail
near
the
shelf
where
he
kept
his
flash
lamp
in
an
old
soap
whisky
bottle
almost
empty
now
and
an
unread
novel
hell
what
a
life
but
there
was
always
work
to
do
and
odd
incidents
and
frights
and
responsibilities
it
was
worse
this
boredom
for
men
behind
the
lines
in
lorry
columns
which
went
from
to
dump
every
damned
morning
and
back
again
by
the
middle
of
the
morning
and
then
nothing
else
to
do
for
all
the
day
in
a
cramped
little
billet
with
a
sulky
woman
in
the
kitchen
and
squealing
children
in
the
yard
and
a
stench
of
manure
through
the
small
window
a
dull
life
for
an
actor
who
had
toured
in
england
and
america
like
one
i
met
dazed
and
stupefied
by
years
of
boredom
paying
too
much
for
safety
or
for
a
barrister
who
had
many
briefs
before
the
war
and
now
found
his
memory
going
though
a
young
man
because
of
the
narrow
limits
of
his
life
between
one
flemish
village
and
another
which
was
the
length
of
his
lorry
column
and
of
his
adventure
of
war
nothing
ever
happened
to
break
the
monotony
not
even
so
it
was
also
in
small
towns
like
hesdin
bruay
lillers
a
hundred
others
where
officers
stayed
for
years
in
charge
of
shops
labor
battalions
administration
offices
claim
commissions
graves
registration
agriculture
for
soldiers
all
kinds
of
jobs
connected
with
that
life
of
war
but
not
exciting
not
exciting
so
frightful
in
boredom
that
men
were
tempted
to
take
to
drink
to
look
around
for
unattached
women
to
gamble
at
cards
with
any
poor
devil
like
themselves
those
were
most
bored
who
were
most
virtuous
for
them
with
an
ideal
in
their
souls
there
was
no
possibility
of
relief
for
virtue
is
not
its
own
reward
unless
they
were
mystics
as
some
became
who
found
god
good
company
and
needed
no
other
help
they
had
rare
luck
those
fellows
with
an
astounding
faith
which
rose
above
the
irony
and
the
brutality
of
that
business
being
done
in
the
trenches
but
there
were
few
of
them
even
with
hours
of
leisure
men
who
had
been
bookish
could
not
read
that
was
a
common
phenomenon
i
could
read
hardly
at
all
for
years
and
thousands
were
like
me
the
most
exciting
novel
was
dull
stuff
up
against
that
world
convulsion
what
did
the
romance
of
love
mean
the
little
tortures
of
one
man
heart
or
one
woman
troubled
in
their
mating
when
thousands
of
men
were
being
killed
and
vast
populations
were
in
agony
history
greek
or
roman
or
medieval
what
was
the
use
of
reading
that
old
stuff
now
that
world
history
was
being
made
with
a
rush
poetry
poor
poets
with
their
love
of
beauty
what
did
beauty
matter
now
that
it
lay
dead
in
the
soul
of
the
world
under
the
filth
of
battlefields
and
the
dirt
of
hate
and
cruelty
and
the
law
of
the
apelike
man
no
we
could
not
read
but
talked
and
talked
about
the
old
philosophy
of
life
and
the
structure
of
society
and
democracy
and
liberty
and
patriotism
and
internationalism
and
brotherhood
of
men
and
god
and
christian
ethics
and
then
talked
no
more
because
all
words
were
futile
and
just
brooded
and
brooded
after
searching
the
daily
paper
two
days
old
for
any
kind
of
hope
and
light
not
finding
either
xix
at
first
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
our
officers
and
men
believed
that
it
would
have
a
quick
ending
our
first
expeditionary
force
came
out
to
france
with
the
cheerful
shout
of
now
we
be
long
before
they
fell
back
from
an
advancing
tide
of
germans
from
mons
to
the
marne
and
fell
in
their
youth
like
autumn
leaves
the
new
army
boys
who
followed
them
were
desperate
to
get
out
to
the
great
they
cursed
the
length
of
their
training
in
english
camps
we
get
out
till
it
too
late
they
said
too
late
o
god
even
when
they
had
had
their
first
spell
in
the
trenches
and
came
up
against
german
strength
they
kept
a
queer
faith
for
a
time
that
something
would
happen
to
bring
peace
as
quickly
as
war
had
come
peace
was
always
coming
three
months
ahead
generals
and
as
well
as
sergeants
and
privates
had
that
strong
optimism
not
based
on
any
kind
of
reason
but
gradually
it
died
out
and
in
its
place
came
the
awful
conviction
which
settled
upon
the
hearts
of
the
that
this
war
would
go
on
forever
that
it
was
their
doom
always
to
live
in
ditches
and
dugouts
and
that
their
only
way
of
escape
was
by
a
blighty
wound
or
by
death
a
chaplain
i
knew
used
to
try
to
cheer
up
despondent
boys
by
pretending
to
have
special
knowledge
of
inside
politics
i
have
it
on
good
authority
he
said
that
peace
is
near
at
hand
there
have
been
negotiations
in
paris
or
i
do
mind
telling
you
lads
that
if
you
get
through
the
next
scrap
you
will
have
peace
before
you
know
where
you
they
were
not
believing
now
he
had
played
that
game
too
often
old
stuff
padre
they
said
that
particular
crowd
did
not
get
through
the
next
scrap
but
the
padre
authority
was
good
they
had
peace
long
before
the
armistice
it
was
worst
of
all
for
boys
of
sensitive
minds
who
were
lucky
enough
to
get
a
cushie
wound
and
so
went
on
and
on
or
who
were
patched
up
again
quickly
after
one
two
or
three
wounds
and
came
back
again
it
was
a
boy
like
that
who
revealed
his
bitterness
to
me
one
day
as
we
stood
together
in
the
salient
it
the
length
of
the
war
he
said
which
does
one
down
at
first
it
seemed
like
a
big
adventure
and
the
excitement
of
it
horrible
though
it
was
kept
one
going
even
the
first
time
i
went
over
the
top
so
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
dazed
and
drunk
with
all
sorts
of
emotions
including
fear
that
were
worse
before
going
over
i
had
what
we
call
needle
they
all
have
it
afterward
one
did
know
what
one
was
doing
even
the
killing
part
of
the
business
until
one
reached
the
objective
and
lay
down
and
had
time
to
think
and
to
count
the
dead
about
now
the
excitement
has
gone
out
of
it
and
the
war
looks
as
though
it
would
go
on
forever
at
first
we
all
searched
the
papers
for
some
hope
that
the
end
was
near
we
do
do
that
now
we
know
that
whenever
the
war
ends
this
year
or
next
this
little
crowd
will
be
mostly
wiped
out
bound
to
be
and
why
are
we
going
to
die
that
what
all
of
us
want
to
know
what
it
all
about
oh
yes
i
know
the
usual
answers
defense
of
liberty
save
the
empire
but
all
lost
our
liberty
we
slaves
under
and
as
for
the
empire
i
do
give
a
curse
for
it
i
thinking
only
of
my
little
home
at
streatham
hill
the
horrible
hun
i
no
quarrel
with
the
poor
blighters
over
there
by
hooge
they
are
in
the
same
bloody
mess
as
we
are
they
hate
it
just
as
much
we
all
under
a
spell
together
which
some
devils
have
put
on
us
i
wonder
if
there
a
god
this
sense
of
being
under
a
black
spell
i
found
expressed
by
other
men
and
by
german
prisoners
who
used
the
same
phrase
i
remember
one
of
them
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
who
said
in
good
english
this
war
was
not
made
in
any
sense
by
mankind
we
are
under
a
this
belief
was
due
i
think
to
the
impersonal
character
of
modern
warfare
in
which
is
at
so
long
a
range
that
has
the
quality
of
natural
and
elemental
powers
of
death
like
thunderbolts
and
men
killed
twenty
miles
behind
the
lines
while
walking
over
sunny
fields
or
in
busy
villages
had
no
thought
of
a
human
enemy
desiring
their
individual
death
god
and
christianity
raised
perplexities
in
the
minds
of
simple
lads
desiring
life
and
not
death
they
could
not
reconcile
the
christian
precepts
of
the
chaplain
with
the
bayoneting
of
germans
and
the
shambles
of
the
battlefields
all
this
blood
and
mangled
flesh
in
the
fields
of
france
and
flanders
seemed
to
them
to
many
of
them
i
know
a
certain
proof
that
god
did
not
exist
or
if
he
did
exist
was
not
as
they
were
told
a
god
of
love
but
a
monster
glad
of
the
agonies
of
men
that
at
least
was
the
thought
expressed
to
me
by
some
london
lads
who
argued
the
matter
with
me
one
day
and
that
was
the
thought
which
our
army
chaplains
had
to
meet
from
men
who
would
not
be
put
off
by
conventional
words
it
was
not
good
enough
to
tell
them
that
the
germans
were
guilty
of
all
this
crime
and
that
unless
the
germans
were
beaten
the
world
would
lose
its
liberty
and
life
yes
we
know
all
that
they
said
but
why
did
god
allow
the
germans
or
the
statesmen
who
arranged
the
world
by
force
or
the
clergy
who
christened
british
warships
and
how
is
it
that
both
sides
pray
to
the
same
god
for
victory
there
must
be
something
wrong
it
was
not
often
men
talked
like
that
except
to
some
chaplain
who
was
a
human
comradely
soul
some
catholic
padre
who
devoted
himself
fearlessly
to
their
bodily
and
spiritual
needs
risking
his
life
with
them
or
to
some
presbyterian
minister
who
brought
them
hot
cocoa
under
with
a
cheery
word
or
two
as
i
once
heard
of
keep
your
hearts
up
my
lads
and
your
heads
most
of
the
men
became
fatalists
with
odd
superstitions
in
the
place
of
faith
it
no
good
worrying
they
said
if
your
name
is
written
on
a
german
shell
you
ca
escape
it
and
if
it
is
written
nothing
can
touch
officers
as
well
as
men
had
this
fatalistic
belief
and
superstitions
which
amused
them
and
helped
them
have
the
huns
found
you
out
yet
i
asked
some
gunner
officers
in
a
ruined
farmhouse
near
kemmel
hill
not
yet
said
one
of
them
and
then
they
all
left
the
table
at
which
we
were
at
lunch
and
making
a
rush
for
some
oak
beams
embraced
them
ardently
they
were
touching
wood
take
this
with
you
said
an
irish
officer
on
a
night
i
went
to
ypres
it
will
help
you
as
it
has
helped
me
it
my
lucky
he
gave
me
a
little
bit
of
coal
which
he
carried
in
his
tunic
and
he
was
so
earnest
about
it
that
i
took
it
without
a
smile
and
felt
the
safer
for
it
once
in
a
while
the
men
went
home
on
seven
days
leave
or
four
and
then
came
back
again
gloomily
with
a
curious
kind
of
hatred
of
england
because
the
people
there
seemed
so
callous
to
their
suffering
so
utterly
without
understanding
so
damned
they
hated
the
smiling
women
in
the
streets
they
loathed
the
old
men
who
said
if
i
had
six
sons
i
would
sacrifice
them
all
in
the
sacred
they
desired
that
profiteers
should
die
by
they
prayed
god
to
get
the
germans
to
send
zeppelins
to
england
to
make
the
people
know
what
war
meant
their
leave
had
done
them
no
good
at
all
from
a
at
home
i
stood
among
a
number
of
soldiers
who
were
going
back
to
the
front
after
one
of
those
leaves
the
boat
warped
away
from
the
pier
the
and
a
small
group
of
officers
detectives
and
red
cross
men
disappeared
behind
an
empty
train
and
the
revenants
on
deck
stared
back
at
the
cliffs
of
england
across
a
widening
strip
of
sea
back
to
the
bloody
old
trenches
said
a
voice
and
the
words
ended
with
a
hard
laugh
they
were
spoken
by
a
young
officer
of
the
guards
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
platform
of
victoria
saying
to
a
pretty
woman
who
had
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
and
said
do
be
careful
desmond
for
my
sake
afterward
he
had
sat
in
the
corner
of
his
carriage
staring
with
a
fixed
gaze
at
the
rushing
countryside
but
seeing
nothing
of
it
perhaps
as
his
thoughts
traveled
backward
a
few
days
later
he
was
blown
to
bits
by
a
bomb
an
accident
of
war
a
little
man
on
deck
came
up
to
me
and
said
in
a
melancholy
way
you
know
who
i
am
do
you
sir
i
had
the
least
idea
who
he
was
this
little
ginger
haired
soldier
with
a
wizened
and
wistful
face
but
i
saw
that
he
wore
the
ribbon
of
the
on
his
khaki
tunic
he
gave
me
his
name
and
said
the
papers
had
done
him
proud
and
that
they
had
made
a
lot
of
him
at
home
presentations
receptions
speeches
lord
addresses
cheering
crowds
and
all
that
he
was
one
of
our
heroes
though
one
could
tell
it
by
the
look
of
him
now
i
going
back
to
the
trenches
he
said
gloomily
same
old
business
and
one
of
the
crowd
he
was
suffering
from
the
reaction
of
popular
idolatry
he
felt
hipped
because
no
one
made
a
fuss
of
him
now
or
bothered
about
his
ribbon
the
chaplains
brigade
majors
regimental
officers
and
army
nurses
were
more
interested
in
an
airship
a
silver
fish
with
shining
gills
and
a
humming
song
in
its
stomach
france
and
the
beginning
of
what
the
little
had
called
the
same
old
there
was
the
long
fleet
of
as
a
reminder
of
the
ultimate
business
of
all
those
young
men
in
khaki
whom
i
had
seen
drilling
in
the
embankment
gardens
and
shouldering
their
way
down
the
strand
some
stretchers
were
being
carried
to
the
lift
which
goes
down
to
the
deck
of
the
on
which
an
officer
was
ticking
off
each
wounded
body
after
a
glance
at
the
label
tied
to
the
man
tunic
several
young
officers
lay
under
the
blankets
on
those
stretchers
and
one
of
them
caught
my
eye
and
smiled
as
i
looked
down
upon
him
the
same
old
business
and
the
same
old
pluck
i
motored
down
the
long
straight
roads
of
france
eastward
toward
that
network
of
lines
which
are
the
end
of
all
journeys
after
a
few
leave
home
and
back
again
the
same
old
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
which
as
long
as
memory
lasts
to
men
who
had
the
luck
to
live
through
the
war
will
haunt
them
for
the
rest
of
life
and
speak
of
flanders
the
harvest
was
nearly
gathered
in
and
where
a
week
or
two
before
there
had
been
fields
of
high
bronzed
corn
there
were
now
long
stretches
of
stubbled
ground
waiting
for
the
plow
the
had
been
piled
into
stacks
or
from
many
great
fields
carted
away
to
the
barns
below
the
black
old
windmills
whose
sails
were
motionless
because
no
breath
of
air
stirred
on
this
september
afternoon
the
smell
of
flemish
villages
a
mingled
odor
of
thatch
and
bakeries
and
manure
heaps
and
cows
and
ancient
vapors
stored
up
through
the
centuries
was
overborne
by
a
new
and
more
pungent
aroma
which
crept
over
the
fields
with
the
evening
haze
it
was
a
sad
melancholy
smell
telling
of
corruption
and
death
it
was
the
first
breath
of
autumn
and
i
shivered
a
little
must
there
be
another
winter
of
war
the
old
misery
of
darkness
and
dampness
was
creeping
up
through
the
splendor
of
september
sunshine
those
soldiers
did
not
seem
to
smell
it
or
if
their
nostrils
were
keen
to
mind
its
menace
those
soldiers
who
came
marching
down
the
road
with
tanned
faces
how
fine
they
looked
and
how
hard
and
how
cheerful
with
their
lot
speak
to
them
separately
and
every
man
would
grouse
at
the
duration
of
the
war
and
swear
that
he
was
fed
up
with
it
homesickness
assailed
them
at
times
with
a
deadly
nostalgia
the
hammering
of
which
takes
its
daily
toll
spoiled
their
temper
and
shook
their
nerves
as
far
as
a
british
soldier
had
any
nerves
which
i
used
to
sometimes
doubt
until
i
saw
again
the
cases
but
again
i
heard
their
laughter
and
an
old
song
whistled
vilely
out
of
tune
but
cheerful
to
the
tramp
of
their
feet
they
were
going
back
to
the
trenches
after
a
spell
in
a
to
the
same
old
business
of
and
and
dugouts
and
the
smell
of
wet
clay
and
chloride
of
lime
and
the
life
of
who
once
belonged
to
a
civilization
which
had
passed
and
they
went
whistling
on
their
way
because
it
was
the
very
best
thing
to
do
one
picked
up
the
old
landmarks
again
and
got
back
into
the
feel
of
the
war
zone
there
were
the
five
old
windmills
of
cassel
that
wave
their
arms
up
the
hill
road
and
the
estaminets
by
which
one
found
way
down
country
lanes
the
veritable
cuckoo
and
the
lost
corner
and
the
flower
of
the
fields
and
the
first
smashed
roofs
and
broken
barns
which
led
to
the
area
of
constant
ugh
so
it
was
still
going
on
this
bloody
murder
there
were
some
more
cottages
down
in
the
village
where
we
had
tea
a
month
before
and
in
the
of
a
sleepy
old
town
the
windows
were
mostly
broken
and
some
shops
had
gone
into
dust
and
ashes
that
was
new
since
we
last
passed
this
way
london
was
only
seven
hours
away
but
the
hours
on
leave
there
seemed
a
year
ago
already
the
men
who
had
come
back
after
sleeping
in
civilization
with
a
blessed
sense
of
safety
had
a
few
minutes
of
queer
surprise
that
after
all
this
business
of
war
was
something
more
real
than
a
fantastic
nightmare
and
then
put
on
their
moral
cloaks
against
the
chill
and
grim
reality
for
another
long
spell
of
it
very
quickly
the
familiarity
of
it
all
came
back
to
them
and
became
the
normal
instead
of
the
abnormal
they
were
back
again
to
the
settled
state
of
war
as
boys
go
back
to
public
schools
after
the
wrench
from
home
and
find
that
the
holiday
is
only
the
incident
and
school
the
more
enduring
experience
there
were
no
new
impressions
only
the
repetition
of
old
impressions
so
i
found
when
i
heard
the
guns
again
and
watched
the
shells
bursting
about
ypres
and
over
kemmel
ridge
and
messines
church
tower
two
german
airplanes
passed
overhead
and
the
hum
of
their
engines
was
loud
in
my
ears
as
i
lay
in
the
grass
our
shrapnel
burst
about
them
but
did
not
touch
their
wings
all
around
there
was
the
slamming
of
great
guns
and
i
sat
chewing
a
bit
of
straw
by
the
side
of
a
thinking
in
the
same
old
way
of
the
utter
senselessness
of
all
this
noise
and
hate
and
sudden
death
which
encircled
me
for
miles
no
amount
of
meditation
would
screw
a
new
meaning
out
of
it
all
it
was
just
the
commonplace
of
life
out
here
the
routine
of
it
went
on
the
officer
who
came
back
from
home
stepped
into
his
old
place
and
after
the
first
greeting
of
hullo
old
man
had
a
good
time
found
his
old
job
waiting
for
him
so
there
was
a
new
quick
promotion
by
jove
four
men
had
got
knocked
out
that
morning
at
and
it
was
rotten
bad
luck
that
the
should
have
been
among
them
a
real
good
fellow
however
there
that
court
martial
for
this
afternoon
and
by
the
by
when
is
that
timber
coming
up
ca
build
the
new
dugout
if
there
no
decent
wood
to
be
got
by
stealing
or
otherwise
you
heard
how
the
men
got
strafed
in
their
billets
the
other
day
dirty
work
the
man
who
had
come
back
went
into
the
trenches
and
had
a
word
or
two
with
the
then
he
went
into
his
own
dugout
the
mice
had
been
getting
at
his
papers
oh
yes
that
where
he
left
his
pipe
it
was
lying
under
the
just
where
he
dropped
it
before
going
on
leave
the
clay
walls
were
a
bit
wet
after
the
rains
he
stood
with
a
chilled
feeling
in
this
little
hole
of
his
staring
at
every
familiar
thing
in
it
tacked
to
the
wall
was
the
portrait
of
a
woman
he
said
to
her
at
victoria
station
how
long
ago
surely
more
than
seven
hours
or
seven
years
outside
there
were
the
old
noises
the
guns
were
at
it
again
that
was
a
the
enemy
howitzers
were
plugging
away
what
a
beastly
row
that
was
making
playing
on
the
same
old
spot
why
could
they
leave
it
alone
the
asses
anyhow
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
he
had
come
back
again
back
to
the
trenches
and
the
same
old
business
there
was
a
mine
to
be
blown
up
that
night
and
it
would
make
a
pretty
mess
in
the
enemy
lines
the
colonel
was
very
cheerful
about
it
and
explained
that
a
good
deal
of
sapping
had
been
done
we
got
the
bulge
on
he
said
referring
to
the
enemy
failures
in
this
class
of
work
in
the
mess
all
the
officers
were
carrying
on
as
usual
making
the
same
old
jokes
the
man
who
had
come
back
got
back
also
the
spirit
of
the
thing
with
astonishing
rapidity
that
other
life
of
his
away
there
in
old
london
was
shut
up
in
the
cupboard
of
his
heart
so
it
went
on
and
on
until
the
torture
of
its
boredom
was
broken
by
the
crash
of
big
battles
and
the
new
armies
which
had
been
learning
lessons
in
the
school
of
courage
went
forward
to
the
great
test
and
passed
with
honor
part
three
the
nature
of
a
battle
i
in
september
of
the
and
his
staff
were
busy
with
preparations
for
a
battle
in
conjunction
with
the
french
which
had
ambitious
objects
these
have
never
been
stated
because
they
were
not
gained
and
it
was
the
habit
of
our
high
command
to
conceal
its
objectives
and
minimize
their
importance
if
their
hopes
were
unfulfilled
but
beyond
doubt
the
purpose
of
the
battle
was
to
gain
possession
of
lens
and
its
and
by
striking
through
hulluch
and
haisnes
to
menace
the
german
occupation
of
lille
on
the
british
front
the
key
of
the
enemy
position
was
hill
to
the
north
of
lens
beyond
the
village
of
loos
and
the
capture
of
that
village
and
that
hill
was
the
first
essential
of
success
the
assault
on
these
positions
was
to
be
made
by
two
new
army
divisions
of
the
corps
the
london
division
and
the
scottish
division
they
were
to
be
supported
by
the
corps
consisting
of
the
guards
and
two
new
and
untried
divisions
the
and
the
the
cavalry
corps
less
the
cavalry
division
under
general
fanshawe
was
in
reserve
far
back
at
and
pernes
and
the
indian
cavalry
corps
under
general
remington
was
at
doullens
to
be
in
readiness
wrote
sir
john
french
to
with
the
french
cavalry
in
exploiting
any
success
which
might
be
attained
by
the
french
and
british
oh
wonderful
optimism
in
that
black
country
of
france
scattered
with
mining
villages
in
which
every
house
was
a
fort
with
slag
heaps
and
which
were
formidable
redoubts
with
trenches
and
barbed
wire
and
and
quarries
organized
for
defense
in
cavalry
might
as
well
have
ridden
through
hell
with
hope
of
exploiting
success
plans
for
effective
were
fully
arranged
between
the
cavalry
commanders
of
both
armies
wrote
our
in
his
despatch
i
can
imagine
those
gallant
old
gentlemen
devising
their
plans
with
grave
courtesy
over
large
maps
and
clicking
heels
in
attendance
and
an
air
of
immense
wisdom
and
most
cheerful
assurance
governing
the
proceedings
in
the
salon
of
a
french
chateau
the
cavalry
division
less
one
brigade
was
assigned
to
the
first
army
as
a
reserve
and
moved
into
the
area
of
the
corps
on
the
and
of
september
ii
the
movements
of
troops
and
the
preparations
for
big
events
revealed
to
every
british
soldier
in
france
the
secret
of
the
coming
battle
casualty
were
ordered
to
make
ready
for
big
numbers
of
wounded
that
was
always
one
of
the
first
signs
of
approaching
massacre
vast
quantities
of
shells
were
being
brought
up
to
the
and
stacked
in
the
they
were
the
of
the
speeding
up
of
at
home
after
the
public
outcry
against
shell
shortage
and
the
lack
of
high
explosives
well
at
last
the
guns
would
not
be
starved
there
was
enough
force
available
to
blast
the
german
trenches
off
the
map
so
it
seemed
to
our
innocence
though
years
afterward
we
knew
that
no
bombardment
would
destroy
all
earthworks
such
as
germans
made
and
that
always
would
slash
our
infantry
advancing
over
the
chaos
of
mangled
ground
behind
our
lines
in
france
in
scores
of
villages
where
our
men
were
quartered
there
was
a
sense
of
impending
fate
soldiers
of
the
new
army
knew
that
in
a
little
while
the
lessons
they
had
learned
in
the
school
of
courage
would
be
put
to
a
more
frightful
test
than
that
of
holding
trenches
in
stationary
warfare
their
boredom
the
intolerable
monotony
of
that
routine
life
would
be
broken
by
more
sensational
drama
and
some
of
them
were
glad
of
that
and
said
let
get
on
with
it
anything
rather
than
that
deadly
and
others
who
guessed
they
were
chosen
for
the
coming
battle
and
had
a
clear
vision
of
what
kind
of
things
would
happen
they
knew
something
about
the
losses
at
neuve
chapelle
and
festubert
became
more
thoughtful
than
usual
deeply
introspective
wondering
how
many
days
of
life
they
had
left
to
them
life
was
good
out
of
the
line
in
that
september
of
the
land
of
france
was
full
of
beauty
with
bronzed
in
the
fields
and
scarlet
poppies
in
the
grass
and
a
golden
sunlight
on
old
barns
and
on
little
white
churches
and
in
orchards
heavy
with
fruit
it
was
good
to
go
into
the
garden
of
a
french
chateau
and
pluck
a
rose
and
smell
its
sweetness
and
think
back
to
england
where
other
roses
were
blooming
england
and
in
a
few
days
who
could
say
perhaps
eternal
sleep
somewhere
near
lens
some
officers
of
the
guards
came
into
the
garden
of
the
little
house
where
i
lived
at
that
time
with
other
onlookers
it
was
an
untidy
garden
with
a
stretch
of
too
rough
to
be
called
a
lawn
but
with
pleasant
shade
under
the
trees
and
a
potager
with
raspberries
and
currants
on
the
bushes
and
where
red
and
white
roses
dropped
their
petals
two
officers
of
the
scots
guards
inseparable
friends
came
to
gossip
with
us
and
read
the
papers
and
drink
a
little
whisky
in
the
evenings
and
pick
the
raspberries
they
were
not
professional
soldiers
one
of
them
had
been
a
the
other
something
in
the
they
disliked
the
army
system
with
an
undisguised
hatred
and
contempt
they
hated
war
with
a
ferocity
which
was
only
a
little
camouflaged
by
the
irony
and
the
brutality
of
their
anecdotes
of
war
little
comedies
they
took
a
grim
delight
in
the
humor
of
corpses
lice
bayonet
work
and
the
sniping
of
german
boys
they
laughed
almost
excessively
at
these
attributes
of
warfare
and
one
of
them
used
to
remark
after
some
such
anecdote
and
once
i
was
a
little
gentleman
he
was
a
gentleman
still
with
a
love
of
nature
in
his
heart
i
saw
him
touch
the
petals
of
living
roses
with
a
caress
in
his
and
with
a
spiritual
revolt
against
the
beastliness
of
this
new
job
of
his
although
he
was
a
strong
hard
fellow
without
weakness
of
sentiment
his
close
comrade
was
of
more
delicate
fiber
a
gentle
soul
not
made
for
soldiering
at
all
but
rather
for
domestic
life
with
children
about
him
and
books
as
the
evenings
passed
in
this
french
village
drawing
him
closer
to
loos
by
the
flight
of
time
i
saw
the
trouble
in
his
eyes
which
he
tried
to
hide
by
smiling
and
by
courteous
conversation
he
was
being
drawn
closer
to
loos
and
farther
away
from
the
wife
who
knew
nothing
of
what
that
name
meant
to
her
and
to
him
other
officers
of
the
guards
came
into
the
garden
grenadiers
there
were
two
young
brothers
of
an
old
family
who
had
always
sent
their
sons
to
war
they
looked
absurdly
young
when
they
took
off
their
tunics
and
played
a
game
of
cricket
with
a
club
for
a
bat
and
a
they
were
just
schoolboys
but
with
the
gravity
of
men
who
knew
that
life
is
short
i
watched
their
young
athletic
figures
so
so
full
of
grace
as
they
threw
the
ball
and
had
a
vision
of
them
lying
mangled
an
indian
prince
came
into
the
garden
it
was
ranjitsinji
who
had
carried
his
bat
to
many
a
pavilion
where
english
men
and
women
had
clapped
their
hands
to
him
on
glorious
days
when
there
was
sunlight
on
english
lawns
he
took
the
club
and
stood
at
the
wicket
and
was
bowled
third
ball
by
a
man
who
had
only
played
cricket
after
ye
manner
of
but
then
he
found
himself
handled
the
club
like
a
sword
watched
the
ball
with
a
falcon
eye
played
with
it
he
was
on
the
staff
of
the
indian
cavalry
corps
which
was
to
in
exploiting
any
we
move
said
one
of
the
scots
guards
officers
the
colonel
of
the
battalion
came
to
dinner
at
our
mess
sitting
down
to
a
white
tablecloth
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
they
played
a
game
of
cards
and
went
away
earlier
than
usual
two
of
them
lingered
after
the
colonel
had
gone
they
drank
more
whisky
we
must
be
going
they
said
but
did
not
go
the
man
could
not
hide
the
trouble
in
his
eyes
i
be
killed
this
time
he
said
to
a
friend
of
mine
i
shall
be
badly
the
hard
man
who
loved
flowers
drank
his
fourth
glass
of
whisky
it
going
to
be
damned
uncomfortable
he
said
i
wish
the
filthy
thing
were
over
our
generals
will
probably
arrange
some
glorious
little
massacres
i
know
well
good
night
they
went
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
village
lane
battalions
were
already
on
the
move
in
the
night
their
steady
tramp
of
feet
beat
on
the
hard
road
their
dark
figures
looked
like
an
army
of
ghosts
sparks
were
spluttering
out
of
the
funnels
of
army
cookers
a
british
soldier
in
full
field
kit
was
kissing
a
woman
in
the
of
an
estaminet
i
passed
close
to
them
almost
touching
them
before
i
was
aware
of
their
presence
bonne
chance
said
the
woman
quand
to
reviens
one
more
kiss
lassie
said
the
man
mans
comme
to
es
gourmand
toi
he
kissed
her
savagely
hungrily
then
he
lurched
off
the
sidewalk
and
formed
up
with
other
men
in
the
darkness
the
scots
guards
moved
next
morning
i
stood
by
the
side
of
the
colonel
who
was
in
a
gruff
mood
it
looks
like
rain
he
said
sniffing
the
air
it
will
probably
rain
like
hell
when
the
battle
i
think
he
was
killed
somewhere
by
fosse
the
two
comrades
in
the
scots
guards
were
badly
wounded
one
of
the
young
brothers
was
killed
and
the
other
maimed
i
found
their
names
in
the
casualty
lists
which
filled
columns
of
the
times
for
a
long
time
after
loos
iii
the
town
of
bethune
was
the
capital
of
our
army
in
the
black
country
of
the
french
it
was
not
much
shelled
in
those
days
though
afterward
years
afterward
it
was
badly
damaged
by
guns
so
that
its
people
fled
at
last
after
living
so
long
on
the
edge
of
war
its
people
were
friendly
to
our
men
and
did
not
raise
their
prices
exorbitantly
there
were
good
shops
in
the
town
as
good
as
paris
said
soldiers
who
had
never
been
to
paris
but
found
these
windows
dazzling
after
trench
life
and
loved
to
see
the
mamzelles
behind
the
counters
and
walking
out
smartly
with
little
shoes
there
were
crowded
always
with
officers
on
their
way
to
the
line
or
just
out
of
it
and
they
liked
to
speak
french
with
the
girls
who
served
them
those
girls
saw
the
hunger
in
those
men
eyes
who
watched
every
movement
they
made
who
tried
to
touch
their
hands
and
their
frocks
in
passing
they
knew
they
were
desired
as
daughters
of
eve
by
boys
who
were
starved
of
love
they
took
that
as
part
of
their
business
distributing
cakes
and
buns
without
favor
with
laughter
in
their
eyes
and
a
merry
word
or
two
now
and
then
when
they
had
leisure
they
retired
to
inner
rooms
divided
by
curtains
from
the
shop
and
sat
on
the
knees
of
young
british
officers
while
others
played
ragtime
or
sentimental
ballads
on
untuned
pianos
there
was
champagne
as
well
as
tea
to
be
had
in
these
bun
shops
but
the
was
down
on
disorder
or
riotous
gaiety
and
there
were
no
orgies
pas
said
the
young
ladies
severely
when
things
were
getting
a
little
too
lively
they
had
to
think
of
their
business
down
here
and
there
were
houses
where
other
women
lived
not
so
severe
in
their
point
of
view
their
business
indeed
did
not
permit
of
severity
and
they
catered
for
the
hunger
of
men
exiled
year
after
year
from
their
own
and
from
decent
womanhood
they
gave
the
base
counterfeit
of
love
in
return
for
a
few
francs
and
there
were
long
lines
of
men
english
irish
and
scottish
soldiers
who
waited
their
turn
to
get
that
vile
imitation
of
life
romance
from
women
who
were
bought
and
paid
for
our
men
paid
a
higher
price
than
a
few
francs
for
the
circe
cup
of
pleasure
which
changed
them
into
swine
for
a
while
until
the
spell
passed
and
would
have
blasted
their
souls
if
god
were
not
understanding
of
human
weakness
and
of
war
they
paid
in
their
bodies
if
not
in
their
souls
those
boys
of
ours
who
loved
life
and
beauty
and
gentle
things
and
lived
in
filth
and
and
were
trained
to
kill
and
knew
that
death
was
hunting
for
them
and
had
all
the
odds
of
luck
their
children
and
their
children
children
will
pay
also
for
the
sins
of
their
fathers
by
rickety
limbs
and
water
and
madness
and
tuberculosis
and
other
evils
which
are
the
wages
of
sin
which
flourished
most
rankly
behind
the
fields
of
war
the
inhabitants
of
bethune
the
shopkeepers
and
brave
little
families
of
france
and
girls
and
frowzy
women
and
heroines
and
harlots
came
out
into
the
streets
before
the
battle
of
loos
and
watched
the
british
army
pouring
through
battalions
of
londoners
and
scots
in
full
with
hot
sweat
on
their
faces
and
grim
eyes
and
endless
columns
of
and
limbers
drawn
by
mules
cursed
and
thrashed
by
their
drivers
and
ambulances
empty
now
and
wagons
and
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
bonne
chance
cried
the
women
waving
hands
and
handkerchiefs
les
pauvres
enfants
said
the
old
women
wiping
their
eyes
on
dirty
aprons
we
know
how
it
is
they
will
be
shot
to
pieces
it
is
always
like
that
in
this
sacred
war
oh
those
sacred
pigs
of
germans
those
dirty
boches
those
sacred
bandits
they
are
going
to
give
the
boches
a
hard
knock
said
grizzled
men
who
remembered
in
their
boyhood
another
war
the
english
army
is
ready
how
splendid
they
are
those
boys
and
ours
are
on
the
right
of
them
this
time
mother
of
god
hark
at
the
guns
at
night
as
dark
fell
the
people
of
bethune
gathered
in
the
great
square
by
the
hotel
de
ville
which
afterward
was
smashed
and
listened
to
the
laboring
of
the
guns
over
there
by
vermelles
and
and
grenay
and
beyond
notre
dame
de
lorette
where
the
french
guns
were
at
work
there
were
loud
earth
shaking
rumblings
and
now
and
then
enormous
concussions
in
the
night
sky
lights
rose
in
long
spreading
bars
of
ruddy
luminance
in
single
flashes
in
sudden
torches
of
scarlet
flame
rising
to
the
clouds
and
touching
them
with
rosy

they
wondered
if
their
own

would
be
in
the
broth
some
of
them
knew
and
crossed
themselves
by
wayside
shrines
for
the
sake
of
their

souls

in
their
estaminets
cursed
the
germans
with
the
same
old
curses
for
having
brought
all
this
woe
into
the
world
iv
in
those
villages
heuchin
houdain
lillers
and
others
on
the
edge
of
the
black
country
the
scottish
troops
of
the
division
were
in
training
for
the
arena
practising
attacks
on
trenches
and
villages
getting
a
fine
edge
of
efficiency
on
to
and
bombing
and
having
their
morale
heightened
by
addresses
from
brigadiers
and
divisional
commanders
on
the
glorious
privilege
which
was
about
to
be
theirs
of
leading
the
assault
and
on
the
joys
as
well
as
the
duty
of
killing
germans
in
one
battalion
of
scots
the
gordons
who
were
afterward
the
there
were
conferences
of
company
commanders
and
whispered
consultations
of
subalterns
they
were
kitchener
men
from
edinburgh
and
aberdeen
and
other
towns
in
the
north
i
came
to
know
them
all
after
this
battle
and
gave
them
fancy
names
in
my
despatches
the
georgian
gentleman
as
handsome
as
beau
brummell
and
a
gallant
soldier
who
was
several
times
wounded
but
came
back
to
command
his
old
battalion
and
then
was
wounded
again
nigh
unto
death
but
came
back
again
and
honest
john
slow
of
speech
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
careless
of
shell
splinters
flying
around
his
bullet
head
hard
and
tough
and
cunning
in
war
and
little
ginger
with
his
whimsical
face
and
freckles
and
love
of
pretty
girls
and
all
children
until
he
was
killed
in
flanders
and
the
permanent
temporary
lieutenant
who
fell
on
the
somme
and
the
giant
who
had
a
splinter
through
his
brain
beyond
arras
and
many
other
highland
gentlemen
and
one
english
padre
who
went
with
them
always
to
the
trenches
until
a
shell
took
his
head
off
at
the
crossroads
it
was
the
first
big
attack
of
the
division
they
were
determined
to
go
fast
and
go
far
their
pride
of
race
was
stronger
than
the
strain
on
their
nerves
many
of
them
i
am
certain
had
no
sense
of
fear
no
apprehension
of
death
or
wounds
excitement
the
comradeship
of
courage
the
rivalry
of
battalions
lifted
them
above
anxiety
before
the
battle
began
though
here
and
there
men
like
ginger
of
more
delicate
fiber
of
imagination
as
well
as
courage
must
have
stared
in
great
moments
at
the
grisly
specter
toward
whom
they
would
soon
be
walking
in
other
villages
were
battalions
of
the
london
division
they
too
were
to
be
in
the
first
line
of
attack
on
the
right
of
the
scots
they
too
had
to
win
honor
for
the
new
army
and
old
london
they
were
a
different
crowd
from
the
scots
not
so
hard
not
so
steel
nerved
with
more
sensibility
to
suffering
more
imagination
more
instinctive
revolt
against
the
butchery
that
was
to
come
but
they
too
had
been
doped
for
morale
their
nervous
tension
had
been
tightened
up
by
speeches
addressed
to
their
spirit
and
tradition
it
was
to
be
london
day
out
they
were
to
fight
for
the
glory
of
the
old
town
the
old
town
where
they
had
lived
in
little
suburban
houses
with
where
they
had
gone
up
by
the
early
morning
trains
to
city
offices
and
government
offices
and
warehouses
and
shops
in
days
before
they
ever
guessed
they
would
go
and
crouch
in
under
high
explosives
and
thrust
sharp
steel
into
german
bowels
but
they
would
do
their
best
they
would
go
through
with
it
they
would
keep
their
sense
of
humor
and
make
cockney
jokes
at
death
they
would
show
the
stuff
of
london
pride
domine
dirige
nos
i
knew
many
of
those
young
londoners
i
had
sat
in
with
them
when
they
were
playing
dominoes
before
the
war
as
though
that
were
the
most
important
game
in
life
i
had
met
one
of
them
at
a
ball
in
the
albert
hall
when
he
was
sir
walter
raleigh
and
i
was
richard
sheridan
then
we
were
both
onlookers
of
life
chroniclers
of
passing
history
i
remained
the
onlooker
even
in
war
but
my
friend
went
into
the
arena
he
was
a
royal
fusilier
and
the
old
way
of
life
became
a
dream
to
him
when
he
walked
toward
loos
and
afterward
sat
in
in
the
somme
fields
and
knew
that
death
would
find
him
as
it
did
in
flanders
i
had
played
chess
with
one
man
whom
afterward
i
met
as
a
gunner
officer
at
heninel
near
arras
on
an
afternoon
when
a
shell
had
killed
three
of
his
men
bathing
in
a
tank
and
other
shells
made
a
mess
of
blood
and
flesh
in
his
we
both
wore
steel
hats
and
he
was
the
first
to
recognize
a
face
from
the
world
of
peace
after
his
greeting
he
swore
frightful
oaths
cursing
the
war
and
the
staff
his
nerves
were
all
jangled
there
was
another
officer
in
the
london
division
whom
i
had
known
as
a
boy
he
was
only
nineteen
when
he
enlisted
not
twenty
when
he
had
fought
through
several
battles
he
and
hundreds
like
him
had
been
playing
at
red
indians
in
kensington
gardens
a
few
years
before
an
august
in
the
london
division
going
forward
to
the
battle
of
loos
was
made
up
of
men
whose
souls
had
been
shaped
by
all
the
influences
of
environment
habit
and
tradition
in
which
i
had
been
born
and
bred
their
cradle
had
been
rocked
to
the
murmurous
roar
of
london
traffic
their
first
adventures
had
been
on
london
commons
the
lights
along
the
embankment
the
excitement
of
the
streets
the
faces
of
london
crowds
royal
pageantry
marriages
crownings
burials
on
the
way
to
westminster
the
little
dramas
of
london
life
had
been
woven
into
the
fiber
of
their
thoughts
and
it
was
the
spirit
of
london
which
went
with
them
wherever
they
walked
in
france
or
flanders
more
sensitive
than
country
men
to
the
things
they
saw
some
of
them
had
to
fight
against
their
nerves
on
the
way
to
loos
but
their
spirit
was
exalted
by
a
nervous
stimulus
before
that
battle
so
that
they
did
freakish
and
fantastic
things
of
courage
v
i
watched
the
preliminary
bombardment
of
the
loos
battlefields
from
a
black
slag
heap
beyond
and
afterward
went
on
the
battleground
up
to
the
loos
redoubt
when
our
guns
and
the
enemy
were
hard
at
work
and
later
still
in
years
that
followed
when
there
was
never
a
silence
of
guns
in
those
fields
came
to
know
the
ground
from
many
points
of
view
it
was
a
hideous
territory
this
black
country
between
lens
and
hulluch
from
the
flat
country
below
the
distant
ridges
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
and
vimy
there
rose
a
number
of
high
black
cones
made
by
the
refuse
of
the
which
were
called
fosses
around
those
black
mounds
there
was
great
slaughter
as
at
fosse
and
fosse
and
puits
and
the
double
crassier
near
loos
because
they
gave
observation
and
were
important
to
capture
or
hold
near
them
were
the
with
in
elevated
towers
of
steel
which
were
smashed
and
twisted
by
and
in
loos
itself
were
two
of
those
towers
joined
by
steel
girders
and
gantries
called
the
tower
bridge
by
men
of
london
rows
of
red
cottages
where
the
french
miners
had
lived
were
called
corons
and
where
they
were
grouped
into
large
units
they
were
called
cites
like
the
cite
the
cite
and
the
cite
beyond
hill
on
the
outskirts
of
lens
all
those
places
were
abandoned
now
by
men
who
had
fled
down
and
galleries
with
their
women
and
children
and
had
come
up
on
our
side
of
the
lines
at
or
bruay
or
where
they
still
lived
close
to
the
war
shells
pierced
the
roof
of
the
church
in
that
squalid
village
of
noeux
and
smashed
some
of
the
cottages
and
killed
some
of
the
people
now
and
then
later
in
the
war
when
aircraft
dropped
bombs
at
night
a
new
peril
over
shadowed
them
with
terror
and
they
lived
in
their
cellars
after
dusk
and
sometimes
were
buried
there
but
they
would
not
retreat
farther
back
not
many
of
them
and
on
days
of
battle
i
saw
groups
of
french
miners
and
girls
excited
by
the
passage
of
our
troops
and
by
the
walking
wounded
who
came
stumbling
back
and
by
stretcher
cases
unloaded
from
ambulances
to
the
floors
of
their
dirty
cottages
high
velocities
fell
in
some
of
the
streets
whined
overhead
and
burst
like
thunderclaps
young
hooligans
of
france
slouched
around
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
talking
to
our
men
in
a
queer
lingua
franca
grimacing
at
those
noises
if
they
did
not
come
too
near
i
saw
lightly
wounded
girls
among
them
with
bandaged
heads
and
hands
but
they
did
not
think
that
a
reason
for
escape
with
smoothly
braided
hair
they
gathered
round
british
soldiers
in
steel
hats
and
clasped
their
arms
or
leaned
against
their
shoulders
they
had
known
many
of
those
men
before
they
were
their
sweethearts
in
those
foul
little
mining
towns
the
british
troops
had
liked
their
billets
because
of
the
girls
there
london
boys
and
scots
kept
company
with
pretty
slatterns
who
stole
their
badges
for
keepsakes
and
taught
them
a
base
patois
of
french
and
had
a
smudge
of
tears
on
their
cheeks
when
the
boys
went
away
for
a
spell
in
the
ditches
of
death
they
were
little
sluts
with
astounding
courage
are
you
afraid
of
this
place
i
asked
one
of
them
in
when
it
was
unhealthy
there
you
might
be
killed
here
any
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
je
fiche
de
la
mort
i
do
care
a
damn
about
i
had
the
same
answer
from
other
girls
in
other
places
that
was
the
of
the
battle
of
loos
those
mining
towns
behind
the
lines
then
a
maze
of
communication
trenches
entered
from
a
place
called
philosophe
leading
up
to
the
beyond
vermelles
and
running
northward
to
cambrin
and
givenchy
opposite
hulluch
haisnes
and
la
bassee
where
the
enemy
had
his
trenches
and
earthworks
among
the
slag
heaps
the
the
corons
and
the
cites
all
broken
by
and
nowhere
a
sign
of
human
life
aboveground
in
which
many
men
were
hidden
storms
of
broke
loose
from
our
batteries
a
week
before
the
battle
it
was
our
first
demonstration
of
those
stores
of
shells
which
had
been
made
by
the
speeding
up
of
in
england
and
of
a
which
had
been
growing
steadily
since
the
coming
out
of
the
new
army
the
weather
was
heavy
with
mist
and
a
drizzle
of
rain
banks
of
smoke
made
a
pall
over
all
the
arena
of
war
and
it
was
stabbed
and
torn
by
the
incessant
flash
of
bursting
shells
i
stood
on
the
slag
heap
staring
at
this
curtain
of
smoke
hour
after
hour
dazed
by
the
tumult
of
noise
and
by
that
impenetrable
veil
which
hid
all
human
drama
there
was
no
movement
of
men
to
be
seen
no
slaughter
no
heroic
episode
only
through
rifts
in
the
smoke
the
blurred
edges
of
slag
heaps
and
and
smoking
ruins
german
trenches
were
being
battered
in
german
dugouts
made
into
the
tombs
of
living
men
german
bodies
tossed
up
with
earth
and
stones
all
that
was
certain
but
invisible
very
boring
said
an
officer
by
my
side
not
a
damn
thing
to
be
our
men
ought
to
have
a
said
an
optimist
any
living
german
must
be
a
gibbering
idiot
with
i
expect
they
playing
cards
in
their
dugouts
said
the
officer
who
was
bored
even
high
explosives
do
go
down
very
it
stupendous
all
the
same
by
god
hark
at
that
it
seems
more
than
human
it
like
some
convulsion
of
there
no
adventure
in
modern
war
said
the
bored
man
it
a
dirty
scientific
business
i
kill
all
chemists
and
explosive
our
men
will
have
adventure
enough
when
they
go
over
the
top
at
dawn
hell
must
be
a
game
compared
with
the
guns
went
on
pounding
away
day
after
day
laboring
pummeling
hammering
like
thor
with
his
thunderbolts
it
was
the
preparation
for
battle
no
men
were
out
of
the
trenches
yet
though
some
were
being
killed
there
and
elsewhere
at
the
crossroads
by
philosophe
and
outside
the
village
of
masingarbe
and
in
the
ruins
of
vermelles
and
away
up
at
cambrin
and
givenchy
the
german
guns
were
answering
back
intermittently
but
holding
most
of
their
fire
until
human
flesh
came
out
into
the
open
the
battle
began
at
dawn
on
september
vi
in
order
to
distract
the
enemy
attention
and
hold
his
troops
away
from
the
main
subsidiary
attacks
were
made
upon
the
german
lines
as
far
north
as
bellewarde

to
the
east
of
ypres
and
southward
to
la
bassee
canal
at
givenchy
by
the
troops
of
the
second
and
third
armies
this
object
wrote
sir
john
french
in
his
despatch
was
most
effectively
it
was
achieved
by
the
bloody
sacrifice
of
many
brave
battalions
in
the
and
divisions
yorkshire
royal
scots
king
royal
rifles
and
others
and
by
the
meerut
division
of
the
indian
corps
who
set
out
to
attack
terrible
lines
without
sufficient
artillery
support
and
without
reserves
behind
them
and
without
any
chance
of
holding
the
ground
they
might
capture
it
was
part
of
the
system
of
war
they
were
the
pawns
of
strategy
serving
a
high
purpose
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
them
without
reason
not
for
them
was
the
glory
of
a
victorious
assault
their
job
was
to
demonstrate
by
exposing
their
bodies
to
devouring
fire
and
by
attacking
earthworks
which
they
were
not
expected
to
hold
here
and
there
men
of
ours
after
their
rush
over
no
man
land
under
a
deadly
sweep
of
fire
flung
themselves
into
the
enemy
trenches
bayoneting
the
germans
and
capturing
the
greater
part
of
their
first
line
there
they
lay
panting
among
wounded
and
dead
and
after
that
shoveled
up
earth
and
burrowed
to
get
cover
from
the
shelling
which
was
soon
to
fall
on
them
quickly
the
enemy
discovered
their
whereabouts
and
laid
down
a
barrage
fire
which
with
deadly
accuracy
plowed
up
their
old
front
line
and
tossed
it
about
on
the
pitchforks
of
bursting

our

were
mangled
in
that
earth
high

plunged
into
the

of
little
groups
crouching
in
holes
and
caverns

and
scattered

living
unwounded
men
lay
under
those
screaming
shells
with
the
panting
hearts
of
toads
under
the
beat
of
flails
wounded
men
crawled
back
over
no
man

and
some
were
blown
to
bits
as
they
crawled
and
others
got
back
before
nightfall
in
the
dark
a
general
retirement
was
ordered
to
our
original
line
in
that
northern
sector
owing
to
the
increasing
casualties
under
the
relentless
work
of
the
german
guns
like
ants
on
the
move
thousands
of
men
rose
from
the
upheaved
earth
and
with
their
stomachs
close
to
it
crouching
came
back
dragging
their
wounded
the
dead
were
left
on
the
front
of
the
third
army
wrote
sir
john
french
subsidiary
operations
of
a
similar
nature
were
successfully
carried
from
the
point
of
view
of
high
generalship
those
holding
attacks
had
served
their
purpose
pretty
well
from
the
point
of
view
of
sons
they
had
been
a
bloody
shambles
without
any
gain
the
point
of
view
depends
on
the
angle
of
vision
vii
let
me
now
tell
the
story
of
the
main
battle
of
loos
as
i
was
able
to
piece
it
together
from
the
accounts
of
men
in
different
parts
of
the
field
no
man
could
see
more
than
his
immediate
neighborhood
and
from
the
officers
who
survived
it
is
a
story
full
of
the
psychology
of
battle
with
many
strange
incidents
which
happened
to
men
when
their
spirit
was
uplifted
by
that
mingling
of
exultation
and
fear
which
is
heroism
and
with
queer
episodes
almost
verging
on
comedy
in
the
midst
of
death
and
agony
at
the
end
of
a
day
of
victory
most
ghastly
failure
the
three
attacking
divisions
from
left
to
right
on
the
line
opposite
the
villages
of
hulluch
and
loos
were
the
the
scottish
and
the
london
higher

opposite
hulluch
and
haisnes
the
scottish
division
and

of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
chalky
earthworks
thrust
out
beyond
the
german
trenches
on
rising
ground
and
some
the
men
of
those
divisions
were
lined
up
during
the
night
in
the
communication
trenches
which
had
been
dug
by
the
sappers
and
laid
with
miles
of
telephone
wire
they
were
silent
except
for
the
chink
of
shovels
and
side
arms
the
shuffle
of
men
feet
their
hard
breathing
and
occasional
words
of
command
at
when
the
guns
in
all
our
batteries
were
firing
at
full
blast
with
a
constant
scream
of
shells
over
the
heads
of
the
waiting
men
and
when
the
first
faint
light
of
day
stole
into
the
sky
there
was
a
slight
rain
falling
and
the
wind
blew
lightly
from
the
southwest
in
the
trenches
a
number
of
men
were
busy
with
some
long
narrow
cylinders
which
had
been
carried
up
a
day
before
they
were
arranging
them
in
the
mud
of
the
parapets
with
their
nozles
facing
the
enemy
lines
that
the
stuff
to
give
them
what
is
it
worse
than
they
used
at
christ
supposing
we
have
to
walk
through
it
we
shall
walk
behind
it
the
wind
will
carry
it
down
the
throat
of
the
fritzes
we
shall
find
so
men
i
met
had
talked
of
that
new
weapon
which
most
of
them
hated
it
was
at
when
the
men
busy
with
the
cylinders
turned
on
little
taps
there
was
a
faint
hissing
noise
the
escape
of
gas
from
many
pipes
a
heavy
whitish
cloud
came
out
of
the
cylinders
and
traveled
aboveground
as
it
was
lifted
and
carried
forward
by
the
breeze
how
the
gas
working
asked
a
scottish
officer
going
fine
said
an
english
officer
but
he
looked
anxious
and
wetted
a
finger
and
held
it
up
to
get
the
direction
of
the
wind
some
of
the
communication
trenches
were
crowded
with
the
black
watch
of
the
division
hard
bronzed
fellows
with
the
red
heckle
in
their
bonnets
it
was
before
the
time
of
steel
hats
they
were
leaning
up
against
the
walls
of
the
trenches
waiting
they
were
strung
round
with
spades
bombs
and
sacks
a
queer
kind
o
stink
said
one
of
them
sniffing
some
of
the
men
began
coughing
others
were
rubbing
their
eyes
as
though
they
smarted
the
the
wind
had
carried
it
half
way
across
no
man
land
then
a
swirl
changed
its
course
and
flicked
it
down
a
gully
and
swept
it
right
round
to
the
black
watch
in
the
narrow
trenches
some
german
was
coming
too
in
one
small
bunch
eight
men
fell
in
a
mush
of
blood
and
raw
flesh
but
the
gas
was
worse
there
was
a
movement
in
the
trenches
the
huddling
together
of
frightened
men
who
had
been
very
brave
they
were
coughing
spitting
gasping
some
of
them
fell
limp
against
their
fellows
with
pallid
cheeks
which
blackened
others
tied
handkerchiefs
about
their
mouths
and
noses
but
choked
inside
those
bandages
and
dropped
to
earth
with
a
clatter
of
shovels
officers
and
men
were
cursing
and
groaning
an
hour
later
when
the
whistles
blew
there
were
gaps
in
the
line
of
the
division
which
went
over
the
top
in
the
trenches
lay
gassed
men
in
no
man
land
others
fell
swept
by
bullets
shrapnel
and
high
explosives
the
division
was
we
caught
it
badly
said
some
of
them
i
met
later
in
the
day
bandaged
and
bloody
and
plastered
in
wet
chalk
while
gassed
men
lay
on
stretchers
about
them
unconscious
with
laboring
lungs
viii
farther
south
the
of
the
scottish
division
climbed
over
their
parapets
at
and
saw
the
open
ground
before
them
and
the
dusky
paling
sky
above
them
and
broken
wire
in
front
of
the
enemy
trenches
and
through
the
smoke
faintly
and
far
away
three
and
a
half
miles
away
the
ghostly
outline
of
the
tower
bridge
of
loos
which
was
their
goal
for
an
hour
there
were
steady
tides
of
men
all
streaming
slowly
up
those
narrow
communication
ways
cut
through
the
chalk
to
get
into
the
light
also
where
death
was
in
ambush
for
many
of
them
somewhere
in
the
shadows
of
that
dawn
by
the
two
assaulting
brigades
of
the
division
had
left
the
trenches
and
were
in
the
open
shriller
than
the
scream
of
shells
above
them
was
the
skirl
of
pipes
going
with
them
the
pipe
major
of
the
gordons
was
badly
wounded
but
refused
to
be
touched
until
the
other
men
were
tended
he
was
a
giant
too
big
for
a
stretcher
and
had
to
be
carried
back
on
a
tarpaulin
at
the
his
leg
was
amputated
but
he
died
after
two
operations
and
the
gordons
mourned
him
while
the
highlanders
went
forward
with
their
pipes
two
brigades
of
the
londoners
on
their
right
were
advancing
in
the
direction
of
the
long
double
slag
heap
southwest
of
loos
called
the
double
crassier
some
of
them
were
blowing
playing
the
song
of
hullo
hullo
it
a
different
girl
again
and
the
robert
lee
until
one
after
another
a
musician
fell
in
a
crumpled
heap
shrapnel
burst
over
them
and
here
and
there
shells
plowed
up
the
earth
where
they
were
trudging
on
the
right
of
the
londoners
the
french
still
stayed
in
their
trenches
their
own
attack
was
postponed
until
midday
and
they
cheered
the
london
men
as
they
went
forward
with
cries
of
vivent
les
angdais
a
mort
les
boches
it
was
they
who
saw
one
man
kicking
a
football
in
advance
of
the
others
he
is
mad
they
said
the
poor
boy
is
a
lunatic
he
is
not
mad
said
a
french
officer
who
had
lived
in
england
it
is
a
beau
geste
he
is
a
sportsman
scornful
of
death
that
is
the
british
it
was
a
london
irishman
dribbling
a
football
toward
the
goal
and
he
held
it
for
fourteen
hundred
yards
the
goal
in
history
many
men
fell
in
the
five
hundred
yards
of
no
man
land
but
they
were
not
missed
then
by
those
who
went
on
in
waves
rather
like
molecules
separating
collecting
splitting
up
into
smaller
groups
bunching
together
again
on
the
way
to
the
first
line
of
german
trenches
a
glint
of
bayonets
made
a
quickset
hedge
along
the
line
of
earth
which
had
been
the
germans
front
line
trench
our
guns
had
cut
the
wire
or
torn
gaps
into
it
through
the
broken
strands
went
the
londoners
on
the
right
the
scots
on
the
left
shouting
hoarsely
now
they
saw
red
they
were
hunters
of
human
flesh
they
swarmed
down
into
the
first
long
ditch
trampling
over
dead
bodies
falling
over
them
clawing
the
earth
and
scrambling
up
the
parados
all
broken
and
crumbled
then
on
again
to
another
ditch
boys
dropped
with
bullets
in
their
brains
throats
and
bodies
german
were
at
work
at
close
range
hell
said
an
officer
of
the
londoners
a
boy
of
nineteen
there
were
a
lot
of
living
germans
in
the
second
ditch
and
in
holes
about
some
of
them
stood
still
as
though
turned
to
clay
until
they
fell
with
half
the
length
of
a
bayonet
through
their
stomachs
others
shrieked
and
ran
a
little
way
before
they
died
others
sat
behind
hillocks
of
earth
spraying
our
men
with
bullets
until
bombs
were
hurled
on
them
and
they
were
scattered
into
lumps
of
flesh
three
lines
of
trench
were
taken
and
the
londoners
and
the
scots
went
forward
again
in
a
spate
toward
loos
all
the
way
from
our
old
lines
men
were
streaming
up
with
shells
bursting
among
them
or
near
them
on
the
way
to
loos
a
company
of
scots
came
face
to
face
with
a
tall
german
he
was
with
a
bullet
in
his
brain
his
face
all
blackened
with
the
grime
of
battle
but
he
stood
erect
in
the
path
wedged
somehow
in
a
bit
of
trench
the
scots
stared
at
this
figure
and
their
line
parted
and
swept
each
side
of
him
as
though
some
obscene
specter
barred
the
way
rank
after
rank
streamed
up
and
then
a
big
tide
of
men
poured
through
the
german
trench
systems
and
rushed
forward
three
quarters
of
a
mile
more
to
loos
some
of
them
were
panting
out
of
breath
speechless
others
talked
to
the
men
about
them
in
stray
sentences
most
of
them
were
silent
staring
ahead
of
them
and
licking
their
lips
with
swollen
tongues
they
were
parched
with
thirst
some
of
them
told
me
many
stopped
to
drink
the
last
drop
out
of
their
as
one
man
drank
he
spun
round
and
fell
with
a
thud
on
his
face
bullets
were
whipping
up
the
earth
from
loos
came
a
loud
and
constant
rattle
of
were
firing
out
of
the
broken
windows
of
the
houses
and
from
the
top
of
the
tower
bridge
those
steel
girders
which
rose
three
hundred
feet
high
from
the
center
of
the
village
and
from
slit
trenches
across
the
narrow
streets
there
were
one
hundred
in
the
cemetery
to
the
southwest
of
the
town
pouring
out
lead
upon
the
londoners
who
had
to
pass
that
place
scots
and
london
men
were
mixed
up
and
mingled
in
crowds
which
encircled
loos
and
forced
their
way
into
the
village
but
roughly
still
and
in
the
mass
they
were
scots
who
assaulted
loos
itself
and
london
men
who
went
south
of
it
to
the
and
the
double
crassier
it
was
eight
in
the
morning
when
the
first
crowds
reached
the
village
and
for
nearly
two
hours
afterward
there
was
it
was
the
fighting
of
men
in
the
open
armed
with
bayonets
rifles
and
bombs
against
men
invisible
and
in
hiding
with
small
groups
of
scots
like
packs
of
wolves
prowled
around
the
houses
where
the
lower
rooms
and
cellars
were
crammed
with
germans
trapped
and
terrified
but
still
defending
themselves
in
some
of
the
houses
they
would
not
surrender
afraid
of
certain
death
anyhow
and
kept
the
scots
at
bay
awhile
until
those
kilted
men
flung
themselves
in
and
killed
their
enemy
to
the
last
man
outside
those
houses
lay
dead
and
wounded
scots
inside
there
were
the
curses
and
screams
of
a
bloody
vengeance
in
other
houses
the
garrisons
ceased
fire
and
put
white
rags
through
the
broken
windows
and
surrendered
like
sheep
so
it
was
in
one
house
entered
by
a
little
kilted
signaler
who
shot
down
three
men
who
tried
to
kill
him
thirty
others
held
their
hands
up
and
said
in
a
chorus
of
fear
kamerad
kamerad
a
company
of
the
gordons
were
among
the
first
into
loos
led
by
some
of
those
highland
officers
i
have
mentioned
on
another
page
it
was
honest
john
who
led
one
crowd
of
them
and
he
claims
now
with
a
laugh
that
he
gained
his
military
cross
for
saving
the
lives
of
two
hundred
germans
i
ought
to
have
got
the
royal
humane
society
medal
he
said
those
germans
poles
really
from
silesia
came
swarming
out
of
a
house
with
their
hands
up
but
the
gordons
had
tasted
blood
they
were
hungry
for
it
they
were
panting
and
shouting
with
red
bayonets
behind
their
officer
that
young
man
thought
deeply
and
quickly
if
there
were
no
quarter
it
might
be
ugly
for
the
gordons
later
in
the
day
and
the
day
was
young
and
loos
was
still
untaken
he
stood
facing
his
own
men
ordered
them
sternly
to
keep
steady
these
men
were
to
be
taken
prisoners
and
sent
back
under
escort
he
had
his
revolver
handy
and
anyhow
the
men
knew
him
they
obeyed
grumbling
sullenly
there
was
the
noise
of
fire
in
other
parts
of
the
village
and
the
of
from
many
cellars
of
scots
silenced
those
at
last
by
going
to
the
head
of
the
stairways
and
flinging
down
their
the
cellars
of
loos
were
full
of
dead
in
one
of
them
hours
after
the
fighting
had
ceased
among
the
ruins
of
the
village
and
the
line
of
fire
was
forward
of
hill
a
living
man
still
hid
and
carried
on
his
work
the
colonel
of
one
of
our
forward
battalions
came
into
loos
with
his
signalers
and
runners
and
established
his
headquarters
in
a
house
almost
untouched
by
at
the
time
there
was
very
little
shelling
as
the
artillery
officers
on
either
side
were
afraid
of
killing
their
own
men
and
the
house
seemed
fairly
safe
for
the
purpose
of
a
temporary
but
the
colonel
noticed
that
shortly
after
his
arrival
heavy
shells
began
to
fall
very
close
and
the
germans
obviously
were
aiming
directly
for
this
building
he
ordered
the
cellars
to
be
searched
and
three
germans
were
found
it
was
only
after
he
had
been
in
the
house
for
forty
minutes
that
in
a
deeper
cellar
which
had
not
been
seen
before
the
discovery
was
made
of
a
german
officer
who
was
telephoning
to
his
own
batteries
and
directing
their
fire
suspecting
that
the
colonel
and
his
companions
were
important
officers
directing
general
operations
he
had
caused
the
shells
to
fall
upon
the
house
knowing
that
a
lucky
shot
would
mean
his
own
death
as
well
as
theirs
as
our
searchers
came
into
the
cellar
he
rose
and
stood
there
waiting
with
a
cold
dignity
for
the
fate
which
he
knew
would
come
to
him
as
it
did
he
was
a
very
brave
man
another
german
officer
remained
hiding
in
the
church
which
was
so
heavily
mined
that
it
would
have
blown
half
the
village
into
dust
and
ashes
if
he
had
touched
off
the
charges
he
was
fumbling
at
the
job
when
our
men
found
and
killed
him
in
the
southern
outskirts
of
loos
and
in
the
cemetery
the
londoners
had
a
bloody
fight
among
the
tombstones
where
nests
of
german
had
been
built
into
the
vaults
new
corpses
still
bleeding
lay
among
old
dead
torn
from
their
coffins
by
londoners
and
siiesian
germans
lay
together
across
one
another
bodies
the
london
men
routed
out
most
of
the
and
bayoneted
some
and
took
prisoners
of
others
they
were
not
so
fierce
as
the
scots
but
in
those
hours
forgot
the
in
streatham
and
tooting
bec
and
the
manners
of
suburban
drawing
it
is
strange
that
one
german
served
by
four
men
remained
hidden
behind
a
gravestone
all
through
that
day
and
saturday
and
sunday
and
sniped
stray
men
of
ours
until
routed
at
last
by
of
the
guards
brigade
as
the
londoners
came
down
the
slope
to
the
southern
edge
of
loos
village
through
a
thick
haze
of
smoke
from
and
burning
houses
they
were
astounded
to
meet
a
crowd
of
civilians
mostly
women
and
children
who
came
streaming
across
the
open
in
groups
some
of
them
fell
under
fire
snapping
from
the
houses
or
under
shrapnel
bursting
overhead
the
women
were
haggard
and
gaunt
with
wild
eyes
and
wild
hair
like
witches
they
held
their
children
in
tight
claws
until
they
were
near
our
soldiers
when
they
all
set
up
a
shrill
crying
and
wailing
the
children
were
dazed
with
terror
other
civilians
crawled
up
from
their
cellars
in
loos
spattered
with
german
blood
and
wandered
about
among
soldiers
of
many
british
battalions
who
crowded
amid
the
scarred
and
shattered
houses
and
among
the
wounded
men
who
came
staggering
through
the
streets
where
army
doctors
were
giving
first
aid
in
the
roadway
while
shells
were
bursting
overhead
and
all
the
roar
of
the
battle
filled
the
air
for
miles
around
with
infernal
tumult
isolated
germans
still
kept
sniping
from
secret
places
and
some
of
them
fired
at
a
in
the
until
a
french
girl
afterward
decorated
for
valor
she
was
called
the
lady
of
loos
by
londoners
and
scots
borrowed
a
revolver
and
shot
two
of
them
dead
in
a
neighboring
house
then
she
came
back
to
the
soup
she
was
making
for
wounded
men
some
of
the
german
prisoners
were
impressed
as
and
one
jock
had
compelled
four
germans
to
carry
him
in
while
he
lay
talking
to
them
in
broadest
scots
grinning
despite
his
blood
and
wounds
a
london
lieutenant
called
out
to
a
helping
to
carry
down
a
german
officer
and
was
astounded
to
be
greeted
by
the
wounded
man

leslie
i
knew
we
should
meet
one
looking
at
the
man
face
the
londoner
saw
it
was
his
own
cousin
there
was
all
the
drama
of
war
in
that
dirty
village
of
loos
which
reeked
with
the
smell
of
death
then
and
years
later
when
i
went
walking
through
it
on
another
day
of
war
after
another
battle
on
hill
beyond
ix
while
the
village
of
loos
was
crowded
with
hunters
of
men
wounded
dead
batches
of
prisoners
women
doctors
highlanders
and
lowlanders
fey
with
the
intoxication
of
blood
london
soldiers
with
tattered
uniforms
and
muddy
rifles
and
stained
bayonets
mixed
brigades
were
moving
forward
to
new
objectives
the
orders
of
the
scottish
troops
which
i
saw
were
to
go
all
out
and
to
press
on
as
far
as
they
could
with
the
absolute
assurance
that
all
the
ground
they
gained
would
be
held
behind
them
by
supporting
troops
and
having
that
promise
they
trudged
on
to
hill
the
londoners
had
been
ordered
to
make
a
defensive
flank
on
the
right
of
the
scots
by
capturing
the
south
of
loos
and
digging
in
they
did
this
after
savage
fighting
in
the
pit
where
they
bayoneted
many
germans
though
raked
by
bullets
from
a
neighboring
copse
which
was
a
fringe
of
gashed
and
tattered
trees
but
some
of
the
london
boys
were
mixed
up
with
the
advancing
scots
and
went
on
with
them
and
a
battalion
of
scots
fusiliers
who
had
been
in
the
supporting
brigade
of
the
division
which
was
intended
to
follow
the
advance
joined
the
first
assault
either
through
eagerness
or
a
wrong
order
and
unknown
to
their
brigadier
were
among
the
leaders
in
the
bloody
struggle
in
loos
and
labored
on
to
hill
where
camerons
gordons
black
watch
seaforths
argyll
and
sutherland
men
and
londoners
were
now
up
the
slopes
stabbing
stray
germans
who
were
trying
to
retreat
to
a
redoubt
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
hill
for
a
time
there
was
a
kind
of
bank
holiday
crowd
on
hill
the
german
gunners
knowing
that
the
redoubt
on
the
crest
was
still
held
by
their
men
dared
not
fire
and
many
german
batteries
were
on
the
move
out
of
lens
and
from
their
secret
lairs
in
the
country
thereabouts
in
a
state
of
panic
on
our
right
the
french
were
fighting
desperately
at
souchez
and
neuville
and
up
the
lower
slopes
of
vimy
suffering
horrible
casualties
and
failing
to
gain
the
heights
in
spite
of
the
reckless
valor
of
their
men
but
alarming
the
german
staffs
who
for
a
time
had
lost
touch
with
the
situation
their
telephones
had
been
destroyed
by
and
were
filled
with
gloomy
apprehensions
so
hill
was
quiet
except
for
spasms
of
fire
from
the
redoubt
on
the
german
side
of
the
slope
and
the
bombing
of
german
dugouts
or
the
bayoneting
of
single
men
routed
out
from
holes
in
the
earth
one
of
our
men
came
face
to
face
with
four
germans
two
of
whom
were
armed
with
rifles
and
two
with
bombs
they
were
standing
in
the
wreckage
of
a
trench
pallid
and
with
the
fear
of
death
in
their
eyes
the
rifles
clattered
to
the
earth
the
bombs
fell
at
their
feet
and
their
hands
went
up
when
the
young
scot
appeared
before
them
with
his
bayonet
down
he
was
alone
and
they
could
have
killed
him
but
surrendered
and
were
glad
of
the
life
he
granted
them
as
more
men
came
up
the
slope
there
were
greetings
between
comrades
of
hullo
jock
is
that
you
alf
they
were
rummaging
about
for
souvenirs
in
dugouts
where
dead
bodies
lay
they
were
swapping
souvenirs
taken
from
prisoners
silver
watches
revolvers
compasses
many
of
them
put
on
german
like
schoolboys
with
paper
caps
from
christmas
crackers
shouting
with
laughter
because
of
their
german
look
they
thought
the
battle
was
won
after
the
first
wild
rush
the
the
killing
the
sight
of
dead
comrades
the
smell
of
blood
the
nightmare
of
that
hour
after
dawn
they
were
beginning
to
get
normal
again
to
be
conscious
of
themselves
to
rejoice
in
their
luck
at
having
got
so
far
with
whole
skins
it
had
been
a
fine
victory
the
enemy
was
nowhere
he
had
mizzled
some
of
the
scots
with
the
hunter
instinct
still
strong
decided
to
go
on
still
farther
to
a
new
objective
they
straggled
away
in
batches
to
one
of
the
suburbs
of
lens
the
cite
very
few
of
them
came
back
with
the
tale
of
their
comrades
slaughter
by
sudden
bursts
of
fire
which
cut
off
all
chance
of
retreat
the
quietude
of
hill
was
broken
by
the
beginning
of
a
new
bombardment
from
german
guns
dig
in
said
the
officers
we
must
hold
on
at
all
costs
until
the
supports
come
where
were
the
supporting
troops
which
had
been
promised
there
was
no
sign
of
them
coming
forward
from
loos
the
scots
were
strangely
isolated
on
the
slopes
of
hill
at
night
the
sky
above
them
was
lit
up
by
the
red
glow
of
fires
in
lens
and
at
that
night
under
that
ruddy
sky
dark
figures
moved
on
the
east
of
the
hill
and
a
storm
of
bullets
swept
down
on
the
highlanders
and
lowlanders
who
crouched
low
in
the
mangled
earth
it
was
a
by
masses
of
men
crawling
up
to
the
crest
from
the
reverse
side
and
trying
to
get
the
scots
out
of
the
slopes
below
but
the
men
of
the
division
answered
by
volleys
of
fire
and
bombs
they
held
on
in
spite
of
dead
and
wounded
men
thinning
out
their
fighting
strength
at
in
the
morning
there
was
another
strong
repulsed
also
but
at
another
price
of
life
in
those
holes
and
ditches
on
the
hillside
scottish
officers
stared
anxiously
back
toward
their
old
lines
where
were
the
supports
why
did
they
get
no
help
why
were
they
left
clinging
like
this
to
an
isolated
hill
the
german
artillery
had
reorganized
they
were
barraging
the
ground
about
loos
fiercely
and
continuously
they
were
covering
a
great
stretch
of
country
up
to
hulluch
and
north
of
it
with
intense
harassing
fire
later
on
that
saturday
morning
the
division
received
orders
to
attack
and
capture
the
german
earthwork
redoubt
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
a
brigade
of
the
division
was
nominally
in
support
of
them
but
only
small
groups
of
that
brigade
appeared
on
the
scene
a
few
officers
savage
with
anger
almost
mad
with
some
despair
in
them
with
batches
of
english
lads
who
looked
famished
with
hunger
weak
after
long
marching
demoralized
by
some
tragedy
that
had
happened
to
them
they
were
scots
who
did
most
of
the
work
in
trying
to
capture
the
redoubt
the
same
scots
who
had
fought
through
loos
they
tried
to
reach
the
crest
again
and
again
they
crawled
forward
and
up
but
the
blasts
of
fire
mowed
them
down
and
many
young
scots
lay
motionless
on
those
chalky
slopes
with
their
kilts
riddled
with
bullets
others
hit
in
the
head
or
arms
or
legs
writhed
like
snakes
back
to
the
cover
of
broken
trenches
where
are
the
supports
asked
the
scottish
officers
in
god
name
where
are
the
troops
who
were
to
follow
on
why
did
we
do
all
this
bloody
fighting
to
be
hung
up
in
the
air
like
this
the
answer
to
their
question
has
not
been
given
in
any
official
despatch
it
is
answered
by
the
tragedy
of
the
and
divisions
who
will
never
forget
the
misery
of
that
day
though
not
many
are
now
alive
who
suffered
it
their
part
of
the
battle
i
will
tell
later
x
to
onlookers
there
were
some
of
the
signs
of
victory
on
that
day
of
september
of
victory
and
its
price
i
met
great
numbers
of
the
lightly
wounded
men
mostly
jocks
and
they
were
in
exalted
spirits
because
they
had
done
well
in
this
ordeal
and
had
come
through
it
and
out
of
it
alive
they
came
straggling
back
through
the
villages
behind
the
lines
to
the
casualty
clearing
stations
and
some
of
them
had
the
sleeves
of
their
tunics
cut
away
and
showed
brown
brawny
arms
tightly
bandaged
and
smeared
with
blood
some
of
them
were
wounded
in
the
legs
and
hobbled
with
their
arms
about
their
necks
their
kilts
were
torn
and
plastered
with
chalky
mud
nearly
all
of
them
had
some
souvenir
of
the
fighting
german
watches
caps
cartridges
they
carried
themselves
with
a
warrior
look
so
hard
so
lean
so
these
young
scots
of
the
black
watch
and
camerons
and
gordons
they
told
tales
of
their
own
adventure
in
broad
scots
hard
to
understand
and
laughed
grimly
at
the
killing
they
had
done
though
here
and
there
a
lad
among
them
had
a
look
of
bad
remembrance
in
his
eyes
and
older
men
spoke
gravely
of
the
scenes
on
the
battlefield
and
called
it
but
their
pride
was
high
they
had
done
what
they
had
been
asked
to
do
the
division
had
proved
its
quality
their
old
battalions
famous
in
history
had
gained
new
honor
thousands
of
those
lightly
wounded
men
swarmed
about
a
long
standing
in
a
field
near
the
village
of
choques
they
crowded
the
carriages
leaned
out
of
the
windows
with
their
bandaged
heads
and
arms
shouting
at
friends
they
saw
in
the
other
crowds
the
spirit
of
victory
and
of
lucky
escape
uplifted
those
lads
drugged
them
and
now
they
were
going
home
for
a
spell
home
to
bonny
scotland
with
a
wound
that
would
take
some
time
to
heal
there
were
other
wounded
men
from
whom
no
laughter
came
nor
any
sound
they
were
carried
to
the
train
on
stretchers
laid
down
awhile
on
the
wooden
platforms
covered
with
blankets
up
to
their
chins
unless
they
uncovered
themselves
with
convulsive
movements
i
saw
one
young
londoner
so
smashed
about
the
face
that
only
his
eyes
were
uncovered
between
layers
of
bandages
and
they
were
glazed
with
the
first
film
of
death
another
had
his
jaw
blown
clean
away
so
the
doctor
told
me
and
the
upper
half
of
his
face
was
livid
and
discolored
by
explosive
gases
a
splendid
boy
of
the
black
watch
was
but
a
living
trunk
both
his
arms
and
both
his
legs
were
shattered
if
he
lived
after
butcher
work
of
surgery
he
would
be
one
of
those
who
go
about
in
boxes
on
wheels
from
whom
men
turn
their
eyes
away
sick
with
a
sense
of
horror
there
were
blind
boys
led
to
the
train
by
wounded
comrades
groping
very
quiet
thinking
of
a
life
of
darkness
ahead
of
them
forever
in
the
darkness
which
shut
in
their
souls
for
days
and
weeks
that
followed
there
was
always
a
procession
of
ambulances
on
the
way
to
the
dirty
little
town
of
lillers
and
going
along
the
roads
i
used
to
look
back
at
them
and
see
the
soles
of
muddy
boots
upturned
below
brown
blankets
it
was
more
human
wreckage
coming
down
from
the
salient
of
loos
from
the
chalkpits
of
hulluch
and
the
tumbled
earth
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
which
had
been
partly
gained
by
the
battle
which
did
not
succeed
outside
a
square
brick
building
which
was
the
town
hall
of
lillers
and
for
a
time
a
casualty
the
bad
cases
were
unloaded
men
with
chunks
of
steel
in
their
lungs
and
bowels
were
vomiting
great
gobs
of
blood
men
with
arms
and
legs
torn
from
their
trunks
men
without
noses
and
their
brains
throbbing
through
opened
scalps
men
without
faces
xi
to
a
field
behind
the
railway
station
near
the
grimy
village
of
choques
on
the
edge
of
this
black
country
of
france
the
prisoners
were
brought
and
i
went
among
them
and
talked
with
some
of
them
on
a
sunday
morning
when
now
the
rain
had
stopped
and
there
was
a
blue
sky
overhead
and
good
visibility
for
german
guns
and
ours
there
were
fourteen
hundred
german
prisoners
awaiting
entrainment
a
mass
of
men
lying
on
the
wet
earth
in
huddled
heaps
of
misery
while
a
few
of
our
tommies
stood
among
them
with
fixed
bayonets
they
were
the
men
who
had
surrendered
from
deep
dugouts
in
the
trenches
between
us
and
loos
and
from
the
cellars
of
loos
itself
they
had
seen
many
of
their
comrades
bayoneted
some
of
them
had
shrieked
for
mercy
others
had
not
shrieked
having
no
power
of
sound
in
their
throats
but
had
shrunk
back
at
the
sight
of
glinting
bayonets
with
an
animal
fear
of
death
now
all
that
was
a
nightmare
memory
and
they
were
out
of
it
all
until
the
war
should
end
next
year
the
year
after
the
year
after
that
who
could
tell
they
had
been
soaked
to
the
skin
in
the
night
and
their
gray
uniforms
were
still
soddened
many
of
them
were
sleeping
in
huddled
grotesque
postures
like
dead
men
some
lying
on
their
stomachs
face
downward
others
were
awake
sitting
hunched
up
with
drooping
heads
and
a
beaten
exhausted
look
others
paced
up
and
down
up
and
down
like
caged
animals
as
they
were
famished
and
parched
until
we
could
distribute
the
rations
many
of
them
were
dying
and
a
german
ambulanceman
went
among
them
injecting
them
with
morphine
to
ease
the
agony
which
made
them
writhe
and
groan
two
men
held
their
stomachs
moaning
and
whimpering
with
a
pain
that
gnawed
their
bowels
caused
by
cold
and
damp
they
cried
out
to
me
asking
for
a
doctor
a
friend
of
mine
carried
a
water
jar
to
some
of
the
wounded
and
held
it
to
their
lips
one
of
them
refused
he
was
a
tall
fellow
with
a
bloody
rag
round
his
head
a
typical
hun
i
thought
but
he
pointed
to
a
comrade
who
lay
gasping
beside
him
and
said
in
german
he
needs
it
this
man
had
never
heard
of
sir
philip
sidney
who
at
zutphen
when
thirsty
and
near
death
said
his
need
is
greater
than
mine
but
he
had
the
same
chivalry
in
his
soul
the
officer
in
charge
of
their
escort
could
not
speak
german
and
had
no
means
of
explaining
to
the
prisoners
that
they
were
to
take
their
turn
to
get
rations
and
water
at
a
dump
nearby
it
was
a
war
correspondent
young
valentine
williams
afterward
a
very
gallant
officer
in
the
irish
guards
who
gave
the
orders
in
fluent
and
incisive
german
he
began
with
a
hoarse
shout
of
achtung
and
that
old
word
of
command
had
an
electrical
effect
on
many
of
the
men
even
those
who
had
seemed
asleep
staggered
to
their
feet
and
stood
at
attention
the
habit
of
discipline
was
part
of
their
very
life
and
men
almost
dead
strove
to
obey
the
officers
formed
parties
to
draw
and
distribute
the
rations
and
then
those
prisoners
clutched
at
hunks
of
bread
and
ate
in
a
famished
way
like
starved
beasts
some
of
them
had
been
four
days
hungry
cut
off
from
their
supplies
by
our
barrage
fire
and
intense
hunger
gave
them
a
kind
of
vitality
when
food
appeared
the
sight
of
that
mass
of
men
reduced
to
such
depths
of
human
misery
was
horrible
one
had
no
hate
in
one
heart
for
them
then
poor
devils
said
an
officer
with
me
poor
beasts
here
we
see
the
of
war
the
of
war
i
spoke
to
some
of
them
in
bad
german
and
understood
their
answer
it
is
better
here
than
on
the
battlefield
said
one
of
them
we
are
glad
to
be
one
of
them
waved
his
hand
toward
the
tumult
of
guns
which
were
firing
ceaselessly
i
pity
our
poor
people
there
he
said
one
of
them
who
spoke
english
described
all
he
had
seen
of
the
battle
which
was
not
much
because
no
man
at
such
a
time
sees
more
than
what
happens
within
a
yard
or
two
the
english
caught
us
by
surprise
when
the
attack
came
at
last
he
said
the
bombardment
had
been
going
on
for
days
and
we
could
not
guess
when
the
attack
would
begin
i
was
in
a
deep
dugout
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
a
shell
came
through
the
roof
and
blow
us
to
pieces
the
earth
shook
above
our
heads
wounded
men
crawled
into
the
dugout
and
some
of
them
died
down
there
we
sat
looking
at
their
bodies
in
the
doorway
and
up
the
steps
i
climbed
over
them
when
a
lull
came
a
friend
of
mine
was
there
dead
and
i
stepped
on
his
stomach
to
get
upstairs
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
a
crowd
of
your
soldiers
streaming
past
our
trenches
we
were
surrounded
on
three
sides
and
our
position
was
hopeless
some
of
our
men
started
firing
but
it
was
only
asking
for
death
your
men
killed
them
with
bayonets
i
went
back
into
my
dugout
and
waited
presently
there
was
an
explosion
in
the
doorway
and
part
of
the
dugout
fell
in
one
of
the
men
with
me
had
his
head
blown
off
and
his
blood
spurted
on
me
i
was
dazed
but
through
the
fumes
i
saw
an
english
soldier
in
a
petticoat
standing
at
the
doorway
making
ready
to
throw
another
bomb
i
shouted
to
him
in
english
kill
us
we
surrender
he
was
silent
for
a
second
or
two
and
i
thought
he
would
throw
his
bomb
then
he
said
out
you
swine
so
we
went
out
and
saw
many
soldiers
in
petticoats
your
highlanders
with
bayonets
they
wanted
to
kill
us
but
one
man
argued
with
them
in
words
i
could
not
we
were
told
to
go
along
a
trench
even
then
we
expected
death
but
came
to
another
group
of
prisoners
and
joined
them
on
their
way
back
gott
sei
dank
he
spoke
gravely
and
simply
this
dirty
bearded
man
who
had
been
a
clerk
in
a
london
office
he
had
the
truthfulness
of
a
man
who
had
just
come
from
great
horrors
many
of
the
men
around
him
were
polish
than
german
some
of
them
could
not
speak
more
than
a
few
words
of
german
and
were
true
slavs
in
physical
type
with
flat
a
group
of
german
artillery
officers
had
been
captured
and
they
were
behaving
with
studied
arrogance
and
insolence
as
they
smoked
cigarettes
apart
from
the
men
and
looked
in
a
jeering
way
at
our
officers
did
you
get
any
of
our
gas
this
morning
i
asked
them
and
one
of
them
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
smelled
it
a
little
it
was
rather
nice
the
english
always
imitate
the
german
but
without
much
they
grinned
and
imitated
my
way
of
saying
guten
tag
when
i
left
them
it
took
a
year
or
more
to
tame
the
arrogance
of
the
german
officer
at
the
end
of
the
somme
battles
he
changed
his
manner
when
captured
and
was
very
polite
in
another
place
a
prison
in
i
had
a
conversation
with
two
other
officers
of
the
german
army
who
were
more
courteous
than
the
gunners
they
had
been
taken
at
hooge
and
were
both
prussians
one
a
stout
captain
smiling
behind
horn
spectacles
with
a
false
jovial
manner
hiding
the
effect
of
the
ordeal
from
which
he
had
just
escaped
and
his
hatred
of
us
the
other
a
young
slim
fellow
with
features
who
was
very
nervous
but
bowed
repeatedly
with
his
heels
together
as
though
in
a
cafe
at
ehrenbreitstein
when
high
officers
came
in
a
few
hours
before
he
had
been
buried
alive
one
of
our
mines
had
exploded
under
him
flinging
a
heap
of
earth
over
him
the
fat
man
by
his
side
his
captain
had
been
buried
too
in
the
dugout
they
had
scraped
themselves
out
by
clawing
at
the
earth
they
were
cautious
about
answering
questions
on
the
war
but
the
younger
man
said
they
were
prepared
down
to
the
last
gaiter
for
another
winter
campaign
and
that
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
a
fine
touch
of
audacity
for
two
more
winter
campaigns
if
need
be
the
winter
of
after
this
autumn
and
winter
of
and
then
after
that
the
winter
of
the
words
of
that
young
prussian
seemed
to
me
the
more
i
thought
of
them
idiotic
and
almost
insane
why
the
world
itself
could
not
suffer
two
more
years
of
war
it
would
end
before
then
in
general
anarchy
the
wild
revolutions
of
armies
on
all
fronts
humanity
of
every
nation
would
revolt
against
such
prolonged
slaughter
it
was
i
who
was
mad
in
the
foolish
faith
that
the
war
would
end
before
another
year
had
passed
because
i
thought
that
would
be
the
limit
of
endurance
of
such
mutual
massacre
in
a
room
next
to
those
two
officers
a
week
before
this
battle
the
captain
had
been
rowing
with
his
wife
on
the
lake
at
potsdam
was
another
prisoner
who
wept
and
wept
he
had
escaped
to
our
lines
before
the
battle
to
save
his
skin
and
now
was
and
thought
he
had
lost
his
soul
what
stabbed
his
conscience
most
was
the
thought
that
his
wife
and
children
would
lose
their
allowances
because
of
his
treachery
he
stared
at
us
with
wild
red
eyes
ach
mein
armes
weib
meine
kinder
ach
gott
in
himmel
he
had
no
pride
no
dignity
no
courage
this
tall
bearded
man
father
of
a
family
put
his
hands
against
the
wall
and
laid
his
head
on
his
arm
and
wept
xii
during
the
battle
for
several
days
i
went
with
other
men
to
various
points
of
view
trying
to
see
something
of
the
human
conflict
from
slag
heaps
and
rising
ground
but
could
only
see
the
swirl
and
flurry
of
and
the
smoke
of
shells
mixing
with
wet
mist
and
the
backwash
of
wounded
and
prisoners
and
the
traffic
of
guns
and
wagons
and
supporting
troops
like
an
ant
on
the
edge
of
a
volcano
i
sat
among
the
slag
heaps
with
gunner
observers
who
were
listening
at
telephones
dumped
down
in
the
fields
and
connected
with
artillery
brigades
and
field
batteries
the
guards
are
fighting
round
fosse
said
one
of
these
observers
through
the
mist
i
could
see
fosse
a
hill
of
little
glinting
lights
were
playing
about
it
like
confetti
shining
in
the
sun
that
was
german
shrapnel
eruptions
of
red
flame
and
black
earth
vomited
out
of
the
hill
that
was
german
high
explosive
for
a
time
on
monday
september
it
was
the
of
battle
what
that
asked
an
artillery
with
his
ear
to
the
field
telephone
what
that
hullo
are
you
there
the
guards
have
been
kicked
off
fosse
oh
hell
from
all
parts
of
the
field
of
battle
such
whispers
came
to
listening
men
and
were
passed
on
to
headquarters
where
other
men
listened
this
brigade
was
doing
pretty
well
that
was
hard
pressed
the
germans
were
heavily
their
barrage
was
strong
and
our
casualties
heavy
oh
hell
said
other
men
from
behind
the
mist
came
the
news
of
life
and
death
revealing
things
which
no
onlooker
could
see
i
went
closer
to
see
into
the
center
of
the
arc
of
battle
up
by
the
loos
redoubt
where
the
german
dead
and
ours
still
lay
in
heaps
john
buchan
was
my
companion
on
that
walk
and
together
we
stood
staring
over
the
edge
of
a
trench
to
where
grim
and
gaunt
against
the
gray
sky
loomed
the
high
steel
columns
of
the
tower
bridge
the
which
i
had
seen
before
the
battle
as
an
inaccessible
landmark
in
the
german
lines
now
they
were
within
our
lines
in
the
center
of
loos
and
no
longer
leering
at
us
as
an
officer
once
told
me
they
used
to
do
when
he
led
his
men
into
communication
trenches
under
their
observation
behind
us
now
was
the
turmoil
of
war
thousands
and
scores
of
thousands
of
men
moving
in
steady
columns
forward
and
backward
in
the
queer
tangled
way
which
during
a
great
battle
seems
to
have
no
purpose
or
meaning
except
to
the
directing
brains
on
the
headquarters
staff
and
sometimes
in
history
none
to
them
vast
convoys
of
transports
choked
the
roads
with
teams
of
mules
harnessed
to
wagons
and
with
trains
of
motor
ambulances
packed
with
wounded
men
with
infantry
brigades
plodding
through
the
slush
and
slime
with
divisional
cavalry
halted
in
the
villages
and
great
bivouacs
in
the
boggy
fields
the
men
londoners
and
scots
and
guards
and
yorkshires
and
leinsters
passed
and
repassed
in
dense
masses
in
small
battalions
in
scattered
groups
one
could
tell
them
from
those
who
were
filling
their
places
by
the
white
chalk
which
covered
them
from
head
to
foot
and
sometimes
by
the
blood
which
had
splashed
them
regiments
which
had
lost
many
of
their
comrades
and
had
fought
in
attack
and
through
those
days
and
nights
went
very
silently
and
no
man
cheered
them
legions
of
tall
lads
who
a
few
months
before
marched
smart
and
trim
down
english
lanes
trudged
toward
the
under
the
burden
of
their
heavy
packs
with
all
their
smartness
befouled
by
the
business
of
war
but
wonderful
and
pitiful
to
see
because
of
the
look
of
courage
and
the
gravity
in
their
eyes
as
they
went
up
to
dreadful
places
farther
away
within
the
zone
of
the
fire
the
traffic
ceased
and
i
came
into
the
desolate
lands
of
death
where
there
is
but
little
movement
and
the
only
noise
is
that
of
guns
i
passed
by
ruined
villages
and
towns
to
the
left
was
vermelles
two
months
before
death
nearly
caught
me
there
and
i
stared
at
those
broken
houses
and
roofless
farms
and
fallen
churches
which
used
to
make
one
soul
shiver
even
when
they
stood
clear
in
the
daylight
to
the
right
a
few
hundred
yards
away
was
masingarbe
from
which
many
of
our
troops
marched
out
to
begin
the
great
attack
farther
back
were
the
great
slag
heaps
of
and
all
around
other
black
hills
of
this
mining
country
which
rise
out
of
the
flat
plain
it
was
a
long
walk
through
narrow
trenches
toward
that
loos
redoubt
where
at
last
i
stood
there
was
the
smell
of
death
in
those
narrow
winding
ways
one
boy
whom
death
had
taken
almost
at
the
knelt
on
the
with
his
head
bent
and
his
forehead
against
the
wet
clay
as
though
in
prayer
farther
on
other
bodies
of
london
boys
and
scots
lay
huddled
up
we
were
in
the
center
of
a
wide
field
of
fire
with
the
batteries
on
one
side
and
ours
on
the
other
in
sweeping
semicircles
the
shells
of
all
these
batteries
went
crying
through
the
air
with
high
whining
sighs
which
ended
in
the
cough
of
death
the
roar
of
the
guns
was
incessant
and
very
close
the
enemy
was
sweeping
a
road
to
my
right
and
his
shells
went
overhead
with
a
continual
rush
passing
our
shells
which
answered
back
the
whole
sky
was
filled
with
these
thunderbolts
many
of
them
were
jack
johnsons
which
raised
a
volume
of
black
smoke
where
they
fell
i
wondered
how
it
would
feel
to
be
caught
by
one
of
them
whether
one
would
have
any
consciousness
before
being
scattered
fear
which
had
walked
with
me
part
of
the
way
left
me
for
a
time
i
had
a
strange
sense
of
exhilaration
an
intoxicated
interest
in
this
foul
scene
and
the
activity
of
that
peering
over
the
parapet
we
saw
the
whole
panorama
of
the
battleground
it
was
but
an
ugly
naked
plain
rising
up
to
hulluch
and
haisnes
on
the
north
falling
down
to
loos
on
the
east
from
where
we
stood
and
rising
again
to
hill
now
in
german
hands
again
still
farther
east
and
a
little
south
the
villages
of
haisnes
and
hulluch
fretted
the
skyline
and
fosse
was
a
black
wart
between
them
the
tower
bridge
close
by
in
the
town
of
loos
was
the
one
high
landmark
which
broke
the
monotony
of
this
desolation
no
men
moved
about
this
ground
yet
thousands
of
men
were
hidden
about
us
in
the
ditches
waiting
for
another
behind
storms
of
fire
the
only
moving
things
were
the
shells
which
vomited
up
earth
and
smoke
and
steel
as
they
burst
in
all
directions
over
the
whole
zone
we
were
shelling
hulluch
and
haisnes
and
fosse
with
an
intense
concentrated
fire
and
the
enemy
was
retaliating
by
scattering
shells
over
the
town
of
loos
and
our
new
line
between
hill
and
the
and
the
whole
length
of
our
line
from
north
to
south
only
two
men
moved
about
above
the
trenches
they
were
two
london
boys
carrying
a
and
whistling
as
though
it
were
a
health
resort
under
the
autumn
sun
it
was
not
a
health
resort
it
stank
of
death
from
piles
of
corpses
all
mangled
and
in
a
mush
of
flesh
and
bones
lying
around
the
loos
redoubt
and
all
the
ground
in
this
neighborhood
and
for
a
long
distance
north
through
the
streets
of
bethune
streamed
a
tide
of
war
the
transport
of
divisions
with
their
limber
ambulance
convoys
ammunition
wagons
infantry
moving
up
to
the
front
despatch
riders
signalers
and
a
great
host
of
men
and
mules
and
the
rain
lashed
down
upon
the
crowds
waterproofs
and
burberries
and
the
tarpaulin
covers
of
streamed
with
water
and
the
bronzed
faces
of
the
soldiers
were
dripping
wet
mud
splashed
them
to
the
thighs
fountains
of
mud
spurted
up
from
the
wheels
of
the
chill
of
winter
made
highlanders
as
well
as
indians
those
poor
brave
wretched
indians
who
had
been
flung
into
the
holding
attack
on
the
canal
at
la
bassee
and
mown
down
in
the
inevitable
way
by
shrapnel
and
bullets
shiver
in
the
wind
yet
in
spite
of
rain
and
great
death
there
was
a
spirit
of
exultation
among
many
at
last
there
was
a
break
in
the
months
of
stationary
warfare
we
were
up
and
out
of
the
trenches
the
first
proofs
of
victory
were
visible
there
in
a
long
line
of
german
guns
captured
at
loos
guarded
on
each
side
by
british
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
men
moving
up
did
not
know
the
general
failure
that
had
swamped
a
partial
success
they
stared
at
the
guns
and
said
by
god
we
got
going
this
time
a
group
of
french
civilians
gathered
round
them
excited
at
the
sight
artillery
officers
examined
their
broken
and
their
inscriptions
pro
gloria
et
ultima
ratio
the
irony
of
the
words
made
some
of
the
onlookers
laugh
a
french
interpreter
spoke
to
some
english
officers
with
a
thrill
of
joy
in
his
voice
had
they
heard
the
last
news
from
champagne
the
french
had
broken
through
the
enemy
line
the
germans
were
in
full
it
was
utterly
untrue
because
after
the
desperate
valor
of
heroic
youth
and
horrible
casualties
the
french
attack
had
broken
down
but
the
spirit
of
hope
came
down
the
cold
wind
and
went
with
the
men
whom
i
saw
marching
to
the
fields
of
fate
in
the
slanting
rain
as
the
darkness
and
the
mist
came
to
end
another
day
of
battle
outside
the
headquarters
of
a
british
army
corps
stood
another
line
of
captured
and
several
of
which
one
had
a
strange
history
of
adventure
it
was
a
russian
taken
by
the
germans
on
the
eastern
front
and
retaken
by
us
on
the
western
front
in
general
rawlinson
headquarters
i
saw
a
queer
piece
of
booty
it
was
a
big
bronze
bell
used
by
the
germans
in
their
trenches
to
signal
a
british
general
rawlinson
was
taking
tea
in
his
chateau
when
i
called
on
him
and
was
having
an
animated
argument
with
lord
cavan
commanding
the
guards
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
captured
artillery
and
other
trophies
lord
cavan
claimed
some
for
his
own
with
some
violence
of
speech
but
general
rawlinson
was
bright
and
breezy
as
usual
our
losses
were
not
worrying
him
as
a
great
general
he
did
not
allow
losses
to
worry
him
he
ate
his
tea
with
a
hearty
appetite
and
chaffed
his
they
were
anticipating
the
real
german
a
big
affair
away
up
the
line
there
would
be
more
dead
piled
up
more
filth
and
stench
of
human
slaughter
but
the
smell
of
it
would
not
reach
back
to
headquarters
xiii
in
a
despatch
by
sir
john
french
dated
october
and
issued
by
the
war
office
on
november
of
that
year
the
stated
that
in
view
of
the
great
length
of
line
along
which
the
british
troops
were
operating
it
was
necessary
to
keep
a
strong
reserve
in
my
own
hand
the
corps
consisting
of
the
guards
the
and
the
divisions
were
detailed
for
this
purpose
this
reserve
was
the
more
necessary
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
tenth
french
army
had
to
postpone
its
attack
until
one
in
the
day
and
further
that
the
corps
operating
on
the
french
left
had
to
be
directed
in
a
more
or
less
southeasterly
direction
involving
in
case
of
our
success
a
considerable
gap
in
our
line
to
insure
however
the
speedy
and
effective
support
of
the
and
corps
in
the
case
of
their
success
the
and
divisions
passed
the
night
of
the
and
on
the
line
beuvry
to
the
east
of
bethune
the
guards
division
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
lillers
on
the
same
by
that
statement
and
by
the
facts
that
happened
in
accordance
with
it
the
whole
scheme
of
attack
in
the
battle
of
loos
will
stand
challenged
in
history
lord
french
admits
in
that
despatch
that
he
held
his
reserves
in
his
own
hand
and
later
he
states
that
it
was
not
until
on
the
morning
of
battle
that
i
placed
the
and
divisions
at
the
disposal
of
the
general
officer
commanding
first
he
still
held
the
guards
he
makes
as
a
defense
of
the
decision
to
hold
back
the
reserves
the
extraordinary
statement
that
there
would
be
a
considerable
gap
in
our
line
in
case
of
our
that
is
to
say
he
was
actually
envisaging
a
gap
in
the
line
if
the
attack
succeeded
according
to
his
expectations
and
risking
the
most
frightful
catastrophe
that
may
befall
any
army
in
an
assault
upon
a
powerful
enemy
provided
with
enormous
reserves
as
the
germans
were
at
that
time
and
as
our
ought
to
have
known
but
apart
from
that
the
whole
of
the
battle
was
as
it
now
appears
fatally
wrong
to
move
divisions
along
narrow
roads
requires
an
immense
amount
of
time
even
if
the
roads
are
clear
and
those
roads
toward
loos
were
crowded
with
the
transport
and
of
the
assaulting
troops
to
move
them
in
daylight
to
the
trenches
meant
inevitable
loss
of
life
and
almost
certain
demoralization
under
the
enemy
between
and
noon
the
central
brigade
of
these
divisions
filed
past
me
at
bethune
and
respectively
wrote
sir
john
french
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
reach
our
old
trenches
until
it
was
sir
frederick
maurice
the
chief
of
staff
who
revealed
that
fact
to
me
afterward
in
an
official
explanation
and
it
was
confirmed
by
battalion
officers
of
the
division
whom
i
met
that
led
to
disaster
by
eight
in
the
morning
there
were
scots
on
hill
they
had
been
told
to
go
all
out
with
the
promise
that
the
ground
they
gained
would
be
consolidated
by
following
troops
yet
no
supports
were
due
to
arrive
until
at
our
original
line
of
attack
still
away
back
from
hill
by
which
time
the
enemy
had
recovered
from
his
first
surprise
had
reorganized
his
guns
and
was
moving
up
his
own
supports
tragedy
befell
the
scots
on
hill
and
in
the
cite
as
i
have
told
worse
tragedy
happened
to
the
and
divisions
they
became
hopelessly
checked
and
tangled
in
the
traffic
of
the
roads
and
in
their
heavy
kit
were
exhausted
long
before
they
reached
the
battlefield
they
drank
the
water
out
of
their
bottles
and
then
were
parched
they
ate
their
iron
rations
and
then
were
hungry
some
of
their
transport
moved
too
far
forward
in
daylight
was
seen
by
german
observers
ranged
on
by
german
guns
and
blown
to
bits
on
the
road
the
cookers
were
destroyed
and
with
them
that
night
food
none
of
the
officers
had
been
told
that
they
were
expected
to
attack
on
that
day
all
they
anticipated
was
the
duty
of
holding
the
old
support
trenches
in
actual
fact
they
arrived
when
the
enemy
was
preparing
a
heavy
and
flinging
over
storms
of
the
officers
had
no
maps
and
no
orders
they
were
utterly
bewildered
with
the
situation
and
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
of
the
enemy
or
their
own
objectives
their
men
met
heavy
fire
for
the
first
time
when
their
physical
and
moral
condition
was
weakened
by
the
long
march
the
lack
of
food
and
water
and
the
unexpected
terror
ahead
of
them
they
crowded
into
broken
trenches
where
shells
burst
over
them
and
into
them
young
officers
acting
on
their
own
initiative
tried
to
lead
their
men
forward
and
isolated
parties
went
forward
but
uncertainly
not
knowing
the
ground
nor
their
purpose
shrapnel
lashed
them
and
shells
plowed
up
the
earth
about
them
and
with
them
dusk
came
and
then
darkness
some
officers
were
cursing
and
some
wept
fearing
dishonor
the
men
were
huddled
together
like
sheep
without
shepherds
when
wolves
are
about
and
saw
by
the
bewilderment
of
the
officers
that
they
were
without
leadership
it
is
that
which
makes
for
demoralization
and
these
men
who
afterward
in
the
battle
of
the
somme
in
the
following
year
fought
with
magnificent
valor
were
on
that
day
at
loos
demoralized
in
a
tragic
and
complete
way
those
who
had
gone
forward
came
back
to
the
crowded
trenches
and
added
to
the
panic
and
the
rage
and
the
anguish
men
smashed
their
rifles
in
a
kind
of
madness
boys
were
cursing
and
weeping
at
the
same
time
they
were
too
hopelessly
disordered
and
dismayed
by
the
lack
of
guidance
and
by
the
shock
to
their
sense
of
discipline
to
be
of
much
use
in
that
battle
some
bodies
of
them
in
both
these
unhappy
divisions
arrived
in
front
of
hill
at
the
very
time
when
the
enemy
launched
his
first
and
were
driven
back
in
disorder
some
days
later
i
saw
the
division
marching
back
behind
the
lines
rain
slashed
them
they
walked
with
bent
heads
the
young
officers
were
blanched
and
had
a
beaten
look
the
sight
of
those
dejected
men
was
tragic
and
pitiful
xiv
meanwhile
at
on
the
evening
of
the
first
day
of
battle
the
guards
arrived
at
as
i
saw
them
march
up
splendid
in
their
height
and
strength
and
glory
of
youth
i
looked
out
for
the
officers
i
knew
yet
hoped
i
should
not
see
them
that
man
who
had
given
a
farewell
touch
to
the
flowers
in
the
garden
of
our
billet
that
other
one
who
knew
he
would
be
wounded
those
two
young
brothers
who
had
played
cricket
on
a
sunny
afternoon
i
did
not
see
them
but
saw
only
columns
of
men
staring
grimly
ahead
of
them
with
strange
unspeakable
thoughts
behind
their
masklike
faces
it
was
not
until
the
morning
of
the
that
the
placed
them
at
the
disposal
of
the
general
officer
commanding
first
army
and
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
monday
the
that
they
were
ordered
to
attack
by
that
time
we
had
lost
fosse
one
brigade
of
the
scottish
division
having
been
flung
back
to
its
own
trenches
after
desperate
fighting
at
frightful
cost
after
the
capture
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
by
the
brigade
of
that
division
to
the
north
of
them
the
division
was
also
suffering
horrible
losses
after
the
capture
of
the
quarries
near
hulluch
and
the
village
of
haisnes
which
afterward
was
lost
the
commanding
officers
of
both
divisions
general
capper
of
the
and
general
thesiger
of
the
were
killed
as
they
reconnoitered
the
ground
and
wounded
men
were
pouring
down
to
the
casualty
clearing
stations
if
they
had
the
luck
to
get
so
far
some
of
them
had
not
that
luck
but
lay
for
nearly
two
days
before
they
were
rescued
by
the
from
quality
street
and
philosophe
it
was
bad
all
along
the
line
the
whole
plan
had
gone
astray
from
the
beginning
with
an
optimism
which
was
splendid
in
and
costly
in
the
high
command
our
men
had
attacked
positions
of
enormous
strength
held
by
an
enemy
in
the
full
height
of
his
power
without
sufficient
troops
in
reserve
to
follow
up
and
support
the
initial
attack
to
consolidate
the
ground
and
resist
inevitable
what
reserves
the
had
he
held
in
his
own
hand
too
long
and
too
far
back
the
guards
went
in
when
the
enemy
was
reorganized
to
meet
them
the
division
afterward
in
support
was
too
late
to
be
a
decisive
factor
i
do
not
blame
lord
french
i
have
no
right
to
blame
him
as
i
am
not
a
soldier
nor
a
military
expert
he
did
his
best
with
the
highest
motives
the
blunders
he
made
were
due
to
ignorance
of
modern
battles
many
other
generals
made
many
other
blunders
and
our
men
paid
with
their
lives
our
high
command
had
to
learn
by
mistakes
by
ghastly
mistakes
repeated
often
until
they
became
visible
to
the
military
mind
and
were
paid
for
again
by
the
slaughter
of
british
youth
one
does
not
blame
a
who
was
an
observer
and
recorder
like
myself
does
not
sit
in
judgment
he
has
no
right
to
judge
he
merely
cries
out
o
god
o
god
in
remembrance
of
all
that
agony
and
that
waste
of
splendid
boys
who
loved
life
and
died
on
sunday
as
i
have
told
the
situation
was
full
of
danger
the
scots
of
the
division
weakened
by
many
losses
and
exhausted
by
their
long
fatigue
had
been
forced
to
abandon
the
important
position
of
puits
a
half
a
mile
north
of
hill
linked
up
in
defense
with
the
enemy
redoubt
on
the
northeast
side
of
hill
the
germans
had
been
given
time
to
bring
up
their
reserves
to
reorganize
their
broken
lines
and
to
get
their
batteries
into
action
again
there
was
a
consultation
of
anxious
brigadiers
in
loos
when
no
man
could
find
safe
shelter
owing
to
the
heavy
shelling
which
now
ravaged
among
the
houses
rations
were
running
short
and
rain
fell
through
the
roofless
ruins
and
officers
and
men
shivered
in
wet
clothes
dead
bodies
blown
into
bits
headless
trunks
pools
of
blood
made
a
ghastly
mess
in
the
roadways
and
the
houses
badly
wounded
men
were
dragged
down
into
the
cellars
and
lay
there
in
the
filth
of
friday
fighting
the
headquarters
of
one
of
the
london
brigades
had
put
up
in
a
roofless
barn
but
were
shelled
out
and
settled
down
on
some
heaps
of
brick
in
the
open
it
was
as
cold
as
death
in
the
night
and
no
fire
could
be
lighted
and
iron
rations
were
the
only
food
until
two
chaplains
r
and
church
of
england
no
difference
of
dogma
then
came
up
as
volunteers
in
a
perilous
adventure
with
bottles
of
hot
soup
in
mackintoshes
they
brought
a
touch
of
human
warmth
to
the
brigade
staff
made
those
hours
of
the
night
more
endurable
but
the
men
farther
forward
had
no
such
luck
they
were
famishing
and
soaked
in
a
cold
hell
where
shells
tossed
up
the
earth
about
them
and
spattered
them
with
the
blood
and
flesh
of
their
comrades
on
monday
morning
the
situation
was
still
more
critical
all
along
the
line
and
the
guards
were
ordered
up
to
attack
hill
to
which
only
a
few
scots
were
clinging
on
the
near
slopes
the
cavalry
brigade
dismounted
no
more
dreams
of
exploiting
success
and
galloping
round
lens
were
sent
into
loos
with
orders
to
hold
the
village
at
all
cost
with
the
men
of
the
division
who
had
been
left
there
the
londoners
were
still
holding
on
to
the
south
of
loos
under
murderous
fire
it
was
a
bad
position
for
the
troops
sent
into
action
at
that
stage
the
result
of
the
battle
on
september
had
been
to
create
a
salient
thrust
like
a
wedge
into
the
german
position
and
enfiladed
by
their
guns
the
sides
of
the
salient
ran
sharply
back
from
hulluch
in
the
north
past
the
to
givenchy
and
in
the
south
from
the
lower
slopes
of
hill
past
the
double
crassier
to
grenay
the
orders
given
to
the
guards
were
to
straighten
out
this
salient
on
the
north
by
capturing
the
whole
of
hill
puits
to
the
north
of
it
and
the
still
farther
north
it
was
the
brigade
of
guards
including
grenadiers
welsh
and
scots
guards
which
was
to
lead
the
assault
while
the
brigade
on
the
left
maintained
a
holding
position
and
the
brigade
was
in
support
immediately
behind
as
soon
as
the
guards
started
to
attack
they
were
met
by
a
heavy
storm
of
this
checked
them
for
a
time
as
the
old
fashioned
things
of
flannel
which
were
afterward
changed
for
the
masks
with
nozzles
had
to
be
served
out
and
already
men
were
choking
and
gasping
in
the
poisonous
fumes
among
them
was
the
colonel
of
the
grenadiers
whose
command
was
taken
over
by
the
major
soon
the
men
advanced
again
looking
like
devils
as
in
artillery
formation
small
separate
groups
they
groped
their
way
through
the
poisoned
clouds
shrapnel
and
high
explosives
burst
over
them
and
among
them
and
many
men
fell
as
they
came
within
close
range
of
the
enemy
positions
running
from
hill
northward
to
the
the
irish
guards
supported
by
the
coldstreamers
advanced
down
the
valley
beyond
loos
and
gained
the
lower
edge
of
bois
hugo
near
the
while
the
scots
guards
assaulted
puits
and
the
building
in
its
group
of
houses
known
as
the
keep
another
body
of
guards
including
grenadiers
and
welsh
attacked
at
the
same
time
the
lower
slopes
of
hill
puits
itself
was
won
by
a
party
of
scots
guards
led
by
an
officer
named
captain
cuthbert
which
engaged
in
fighting
routing
out
the
enemy
from
the
houses
some
companies
of
the
grenadiers
came
to
the
support
of
their
comrades
in
the
scots
guards
but
suffered
heavy
losses
themselves
a
platoon
under
a
young
lieutenant
named
ayres
ritchie
reached
the
puits
and
storming
their
way
into
the
keep
knocked
out
a
mounted
on
the
second
floor
by
a
desperate
bombing
attack
the
officer
held
on
in
a
most
dauntless
way
to
the
position
until
almost
every
man
was
either
killed
or
wounded
unable
to
receive
support
owing
to
the
enfilade
fire
of
the
german
night
had
now
come
on
the
sky
lightened
by
the
bursting
of
shells
and
flares
and
terrible
in
its
tumult
of
battle
some
of
the
coldstreamers
had
gained
possession
of
the
which
they
were
organizing
into
a
strong
defensive
position
and
various
companies
of
the
guards
divisions
after
heroic
assaults
upon
hill
where
they
were
shattered
by
the
fire
which
met
them
on
the
crest
from
the
enemy
redoubt
on
the
northeast
side
had
dug
themselves
into
the
lower
slopes
there
was
a
strange
visitor
that
day
at
the
headquarters
of
the
guards
division
where
lord
cavan
was
directing
operations
a
young
officer
came
in
and
said
quite
calmly
sir
i
have
to
report
that
my
battalion
has
been
cut
to
pieces
we
have
been
utterly
lord
cavan
questioned
him
and
then
sent
for
another
officer
look
after
that
young
man
he
said
quietly
he
is
mad
it
is
a
case
of
reports
came
through
of
a
mysterious
officer
going
the
round
of
the
batteries
saying
that
the
germans
had
broken
through
and
that
they
had
better
retire
two
batteries
did
actually
move
away
another
unknown
officer
called
out
retire
retire
until
he
was
shot
through
the
head
german
spies
said
some
of
our
officers
and
men
but
the
intelligence
branch
said
not
spies
madmen
poor
devils
before
the
dawn
came
the
coldstreamers
made
another
desperate
attempt
to
attack
and
hold
puits
but
the
position
was
too
deadly
even
for
their
height
of
valor
and
although
some
men
pushed
on
into
this
raging
fire
the
survivors
had
to
fall
back
to
the
woods
where
they
strengthened
their
defensive
works
on
the
following
day
the
position
was
the
same
the
sufferings
of
our
men
being
still
further
increased
by
heavy
shelling
from
howitzers
colonel
egerton
of
the
coldstream
guards
and
his
adjutant
were
killed
in
the
it
was
now
seen
by
the
headquarters
staff
of
the
guards
division
that
puits
was
untenable
owing
to
its
enfilading
by
heavy
artillery
and
the
order
was
given
for
a
retirement
to
the
which
was
a
place
of
sanctuary
owing
to
the
wonderful
work
done
throughout
the
night
to
strengthen
its
natural
defensive
features
by
sand
bags
and
barbed
wire
in
spite
of
which
raked
it
from
the
neighboring
woods
the
retirement
was
done
as
though
the
men
were
on
parade
slowly
and
in
perfect
order
across
the
field
of
fire
each
man
bearing
himself
so
their
officers
told
me
as
though
at
the
trooping
of
the
colors
until
now
one
and
then
another
fell
in
a
huddled
heap
it
was
an
astonishing
tribute
to
the
strength
of
tradition
among
troops
to
safeguard
the
honor
of
a
famous
name
these
men
showed
such
dignity
in
the
presence
of
death
that
even
the
enemy
must
have
been
moved
to
admiration
but
they
had
failed
after
suffering
heavy
losses
and
the
had
to
call
upon
the
french
for
help
realizing
that
without
strong
assistance
the
salient
made
by
that
battle
of
loos
would
be
a
the
french
tenth
army
had
failed
too
at
vimy
thus
failing
to
give
the
british
troops
protection
on
their
right
flank
on
representing
this
to
general
joffre
wrote
sir
john
french
he
was
kind
enough
to
ask
the
commander
of
the
northern
group
of
french
armies
to
render
us
assistance
general
foch
met
those
demands
in
the
same
friendly
spirit
which
he
has
always
displayed
throughout
the
course
of
the
whole
campaign
and
expressed
his
readiness
to
give
me
all
the
support
he
could
on
the
morning
of
the
we
discussed
the
situation
and
the
general
agreed
to
send
the
french
corps
to
take
over
the
ground
occupied
by
us
extending
from
the
french
left
up
to
and
including
that
portion
of
hill
which
we
were
holding
and
also
the
village
of
loos
this
relief
was
commenced
on
september
and
completed
on
the
two
following
so
ended
the
battle
of
loos
except
for
a
violent
counter
attack
delivered
on
october
all
along
the
line
from
fosse
on
the
north
to
the
right
of
the
french
corps
on
the
south
with
battalions
in
the
first
line
of
assault
it
was
preceded
by
a
stupendous
bombardment
which
inflicted
heavy
casualties
upon
our
division
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
and
upon
the
guards
holding
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
near
hulluch
once
again
those
brigades
which
had
been
sorely
tried
had
to
crouch
under
a
fury
of
fire
until
the
living
were
surrounded
by
dead
half
buried
or
carved
up
into
chunks
of
flesh
in
the
chaos
of
broken
trenches
the
germans
had
their
own
shambles
more
frightful
we
were
told
than
ours
and
thousands
of
dead
lay
in
front
of
our
lines
when
the
tide
of
their
attack
ebbed
back
and
waves
of
living
men
were
broken
by
the
fire
of
our
rifles
and
sir
john
french
staff
estimated
the
number
of
german
dead
as
from
eight
to
nine
thousand
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
accurate
sum
in
that
arithmetic
of
slaughter
and
always
the
losses
were
exaggerated
because
of
the
dreadful
need
of
balancing
accounts
in
corpses
in
that
debit
and
credit
of
bookkeeping
what
had
we
gained
by
great
sacrifices
of
life
not
lens
nor
lille
nor
even
hill
for
our
line
had
to
be
withdrawn
from
those
bloody
slopes
where
our
men
left
many
of
their
dead
but
another
salient
enfiladed
by
german
guns
for
two
years
more
and
a
foothold
on
one
slag
heap
of
the
double
crassier
where
our
men
lived
if
they
could
a
few
yards
from
germans
on
the
other
and
that
part
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
which
became
another
hooge
where
english
youth
was
blown
up
by
mines
buried
by
condemned
to
a
living
death
in
lousy
caves
dug
into
the
chalk
another
salient
narrower
than
that
of
ypres
more
dismal
and
as
deadly
among
the
and
the
black
dust
hills
and
the
broken
of
that
foul
country
beyond
loos
the
battle
which
had
been
begun
with
such
high
hopes
ended
in
ghastly
failure
by
ourselves
and
by
the
french
men
who
came
back
from
it
spoke
in
whispers
of
its
generalship
and
staff
work
and
said
things
which
were
dangerous
to
speak
aloud
cursing
their
fate
as
asking
of
god
as
well
as
of
mortals
why
the
courage
of
the
soldiers
they
led
should
be
thrown
away
in
such
a
muck
of
slaughter
laughing
with
despairing
mirth
at
the
optimism
of
their
leaders
who
had
been
lured
on
by
a
strange
false
terrible
belief
in
german
weakness
and
looking
ahead
at
unending
vistas
of
such
massacre
as
this
which
would
lead
only
to
other
salients
after
desperate
and
futile
endeavor
part
four
a
winter
of
discontent
i
the
winter
of
was
i
think
the
worst
of
all
there
was
a
settled
hopelessness
in
it
which
was
heavy
in
the
hearts
of
men
ours
and
the
enemy
in
there
was
the
first
battle
of
ypres
when
the
bodies
of
british
soldiers
lay
strewn
in
the
fields
beyond
this
city
and
their
brown
lines
barred
the
way
to
calais
but
the
war
did
not
seem
likely
to
go
on
forever
most
men
believed
even
then
that
it
would
end
quickly
and
each
side
had
faith
in
some
miracle
that
might
happen
in
the
winter
was
foul
over
the
fields
of
the
somme
after
battles
which
had
cut
all
our
divisions
to
pieces
and
staggered
the
soul
of
the
world
by
the
immense
martyrdom
of
boys
british
french
and
german
on
the
western
front
but
the
german
retreat
from
the
somme
to
the
shelter
of
their
hindenburg
line
gave
some
respite
to
our
men
and
theirs
from
the
fury
of
attack
and
and
from
the
intensity
of
there
was
at
best
the
mirage
of
something
like
victory
on
our
side
a
faint
flickering
up
of
the
old
faith
that
the
germans
had
weakened
and
were
nearly
spent
but
for
a
time
in
those
dark
days
of
there
was
no
hope
ahead
no
mental
dope
by
which
our
could
drug
themselves
into
seeing
a
vision
of
the
war
end
the
battle
of
loos
and
its
aftermath
of
minor
massacres
in
the
ground
we
had
gained
the
new
horror
of
that
new
salient
had
sapped
into
the
confidence
of
those
battalion
officers
and
men
who
had
been
assured
of
german
weakness
by
cheery
optimistic
generals
it
was
no
good
some
of
those
old
gentlemen
saying
we
got
beat
when
from
hooge
to
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
our
men
sat
in
wet
trenches
under
ceaseless
bombardment
of
heavy
guns
and
when
any
small
attack
they
made
by
the
orders
of
a
high
command
which
believed
in
small
attacks
without
much
plan
or
purpose
was
only
asking
for
trouble
from
german
counterattacks
by
mines
bombing
sorties
and
other
forms
of
frightfulness
which
made
a
dirty
mess
of
flesh
and
blood
without
definite
result
on
either
side
beyond
piling
up
the
lists
of
death
it
keeps
up
the
fighting
spirit
of
the
men
said
the
generals
we
must
maintain
an
aggressive
they
searched
their
trench
maps
for
good
spots
where
another
small
operation
might
be
organized
there
was
a
competition
among
the
corps
and
divisional
generals
as
to
the
highest
number
of
raids
mine
explosions
undertaken
by
their
men
my
corps
one
old
general
told
me
over
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
headquarters
mess
beats
the
record
for
his
casualties
also
beat
the
record
and
many
of
his
officers
and
men
called
him
just
bluntly
and
simply
our
old
they
disliked
the
necessity
of
dying
so
that
he
might
add
one
more
raid
to
his
heroic
competition
with
the
corps
commander
of
the
sector
on
the
left
when
they
waited
for
the
explosion
of
a
mine
which
afterward
they
had
to
rush
in
a
race
with
the
german
some
of
them
saw
no
sense
in
the
proceeding
but
only
the
likelihood
of
having
legs
and
arms
torn
off
by
german
or
shells
what
the
good
of
it
they
asked
and
could
find
no
answer
except
the
satisfaction
of
an
old
man
listening
to
the
distant
roar
of
the
new
tumult
by
which
he
had
raised
hell
again
ii
the
autumn
of
was
wet
in
flanders
and
artois
where
our
men
settled
down
where
the
trenches
were
worst
for
the
winter
campaign
on
rainy
days
as
i
remember
a
high
wind
hurtled
over
the
flemish
fields
but
it
was
moist
and
swept
gusts
of
rain
into
the
faces
of
men
marching
through
mud
to
the
and
of
other
men
doing
sentry
on
the
of
trenches
into
which
water
came
trickling
down
the
slimy
parapets
when
the
wind
dropped
at
dusk
or
dawn
a
whitish
fog
crept
out
of
the
ground
so
that
rifles
were
clammy
to
the
touch
and
a
blanket
of
moisture
settled
on
every
stick
in
the
dugouts
and
nothing
could
be
seen
through
the
veil
of
vapor
to
the
enemy
lines
where
he
stayed
invisible
he
was
not
likely
to
attack
on
a
big
scale
while
the
battlefields
were
in
that
quagmire
state
an
advancing
wave
of
men
would
have
been
clogged
in
the
mud
after
the
first
jump
over
the
slimy
and
to
advance
artillery
was
sheer
impossibility
nothing
would
be
done
on
either
side
but
warfare
and
those
and
minings
which
had
no
object
except
to
keep
up
the
spirit
of
the
there
was
always
work
to
do
in
the
trenches
draining
them
strengthening
their
parapets
making
their
walls
tiling
or
boarding
their
floorways
timbering
the
dugouts
and
after
it
was
done
another
rainstorm
or
snowstorm
undid
most
of
it
and
the
parapets
slid
down
the
water
poured
in
and
spaces
were
opened
for
german
fire
and
there
was
less
head
cover
against
shrapnel
bullets
which
mixed
with
the
raindrops
and
high
explosives
which
smashed
through
the
mud
the
working
parties
had
a
bad
time
and
a
wet
one
in
spite
of
waders
and
gum
boots
which
were
served
out
to
lucky
ones
some
of
them
wore
a
new
kind
of
hat
seen
for
the
first
time
and
greeted
with
guffaws
the
tin
hat
which
later
became
the
headgear
of
all
it
saved
many
head
wounds
but
did
not
save
body
wounds
and
every
day
the
casualty
lists
grew
longer
in
the
routine
of
a
warfare
in
which
there
was
nothing
to
our
men
were
never
dry
they
were
wet
in
their
trenches
and
wet
in
their
dugouts
they
slept
in
soaking
clothes
with
boots
full
of
water
and
they
drank
rain
with
their
tea
and
ate
mud
with
their
bully
and
endured
it
all
with
the
philosophy
of
grin
and
bear
it
and
laughter
as
i
heard
them
laughing
in
those
places
between
explosive
curses
on
the
other
side
of
the
barbed
wire
the
germans
were
more
miserable
not
because
their
plight
was
worse
but
because
i
think
they
lacked
the
english
sense
of
humor
in
some
places
they
had
the
advantage
of
our
men
in
better
trenches
with
better
drains
and
dugouts
due
to
an
industry
with
which
ours
could
never
compete
here
and
there
as
in
the
ground
to
the
north
of
hooge
they
were
in
a
worse
state
with
such
rivers
in
their
trenches
that
they
went
to
enormous
trouble
to
drain
the
bellewarde
lake
which
used
to
slop
over
in
the
rainy
season
those
men
had
to
wade
through
a
slough
of
despond
to
get
to
their
line
and
at
night
by
hooge
where
the
lines
were
close
together
only
a
few
yards
apart
our
men
could
hear
their
boots
squelching
in
the
mud
with
sucking
gurgling
noises
they
drinking
soup
again
said
our
humorists
there
at
hooge
germans
and
english
talked
to
one
another
out
of
their
common
misery
how
deep
is
it
with
you
shouted
a
german
soldier
his
voice
came
from
behind
a
pile
of
which
divided
the
enemy
and
ourselves
in
a
communication
trench
between
the
main
lines
up
to
our
blooming
knees
said
an
english
corporal
who
was
trying
to
keep
his
bombs
dry
under
a
tarpaulin
so
you
are
lucky
fellows
we
are
up
to
our
belts
in
it
was
so
bad
in
parts
of
the
line
during
november
storms
that
whole
sections
of
trench
collapsed
into
a
chaos
of
slime
and
ooze
it
was
the
frost
as
well
as
the
rain
which
caused
this
ruin
making
the
earthworks
sink
under
their
weight
of
german
and
english
soldiers
were
exposed
to
one
another
like
ants
upturned
from
their
nests
by
a
minor
landslide
they
ignored
one
another
they
pretended
that
the
other
fellows
were
not
there
they
had
not
been
properly
introduced
in
another
place
reckless
because
of
their
discomfort
the
germans
crawled
upon
their
slimy
parapets
and
sat
on
top
to
dry
their
legs
and
shouted
do
shoot
do
shoot
our
men
did
not
shoot
they
too
sat
on
the
parapets
drying
their
legs
and
grinning
at
the
gray
ants
yonder
until
these
incidents
were
reported
back
to
h
where
good
fires
were
burning
under
dry
roofs
and
stringent
orders
came
against
every
german
who
showed
himself
was
to
be
shot
of
course
any
englishman
who
showed
himself
owing
to
a
parapet
falling
in
would
be
shot
too
it
was
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
as
always
in
this
trench
warfare
but
the
dignity
of
would
not
be
outraged
by
the
thought
of
such
indecent
spectacles
as
british
and
germans
refusing
to
kill
each
other
on
sight
some
of
the
men
obeyed
orders
and
when
a
german
sat
up
and
said
do
shoot
plugged
him
through
the
head
others
were
extremely
now
and
again
germans
crawled
over
to
our
trenches
and
asked
meekly
to
be
taken
prisoner
i
met
a
few
of
these
men
and
spoke
with
them
there
is
no
sense
in
this
war
said
one
of
them
it
is
misery
on
both
sides
there
is
no
use
in
that
thought
of
war
futility
inspired
an
episode
which
was
narrated
throughout
the
army
in
that
winter
of
and
led
to
curious
conversations
in
dugouts
and
billets
above
a
german
trench
appeared
a
plank
on
which
in
big
letters
was
scrawled
these
words
the
english
are
not
such
bloody
fools
as
all
that
said
a
sergeant
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
plank
was
smashed
to
splinters
by
another
plank
appeared
with
other
words
the
french
are
loyalty
to
our
allies
caused
the
destruction
of
that
board
a
third
plank
was
put
up
we
all
fools
let
all
go
that
board
was
also
shot
to
pieces
but
the
message
caused
some
laughter
and
men
repeating
it
said
there
a
deal
of
truth
in
those
words
why
should
this
go
on
what
it
all
about
let
the
old
men
who
made
this
war
come
and
fight
it
out
among
themselves
at
hooge
the
have
no
real
quarrel
with
one
another
we
all
want
to
go
home
to
our
wives
and
our
but
neither
side
was
prepared
to
go
home
first
each
side
was
in
a
trap
a
devil
trap
from
which
there
was
no
escape
loyalty
to
their
own
side
discipline
with
the
death
penalty
behind
it
spell
words
of
old
tradition
obedience
to
the
laws
of
war
or
to
the
caste
which
ruled
them
all
the
moral
and
spiritual
propaganda
handed
out
by
pastors
newspapers
generals
old
men
at
home
exalted
women
female
furies
a
deep
and
simple
love
for
england
and
germany
pride
of
manhood
fear
of
cowardice
a
thousand
complexities
of
thought
and
sentiment
prevented
men
on
both
sides
from
breaking
the
net
of
fate
in
which
they
were
entangled
and
revolting
against
that
mutual
unceasing
massacre
by
a
rising
from
the
trenches
with
a
shout
of
we
all
fools
let
all
go
home
in
russia
they
did
so
but
the
germans
did
not
go
home
too
as
an
army
and
a
nation
they
went
on
to
the
peace
of
and
their
doom
but
many
german
soldiers
were
converted
to
that
gospel
of
we
all
fools
and
would
not
fight
again
with
any
spirit
as
we
found
at
times
after
august
in
the
last
year
of
war
iii
the
men
remained
in
the
trenches
and
suffered
horribly
i
have
told
about
lice
and
rats
and
there
another
misery
came
to
torture
soldiers
in
the
line
and
it
was
called
many
men
standing
in
slime
for
days
and
nights
in
field
boots
or
puttees
lost
all
sense
of
feeling
in
their
feet
these
feet
of
theirs
so
cold
and
wet
began
to
swell
and
then
to
go
dead
and
then
suddenly
to
burn
as
though
touched
by
pokers
when
the
reliefs
went
up
scores
of
men
could
not
walk
back
from
the
trenches
but
had
to
crawl
or
be
carried
by
their
comrades
to
the
field
dressing
stations
so
i
saw
hundreds
of
them
and
as
the
winter
dragged
on
thousands
the
medical
officers
cut
off
their
boots
and
their
puttees
and
the
socks
that
had
become
part
of
their
skins
exposing
blackened
and
rotting
feet
they
put
oil
on
them
and
wrapped
them
round
with
and
tied
labels
to
their
tunics
with
the
name
of
that
new
disease
those
medical
officers
looked
serious
as
the
number
of
cases
increased
this
is
getting
beyond
a
joke
they
said
it
is
pulling
down
the
battalion
strength
worse
than
brigadiers
and
divisional
generals
were
gloomy
and
cursed
the
new
affliction
of
their
men
some
of
them
said
it
was
due
to
damned
carelessness
others
were
inclined
to
think
it
due
to
deliberate
malingering
at
a
time
when
there
were
many
cases
of
wounds
by
men
who
shot
their
fingers
away
or
their
toes
to
get
out
of
the
trenches
there
was
no
look
of
malingering
on
the
faces
of
those
boys
who
were
being
carried
to
the
at
remy
siding
near
poperinghe
with
both
feet
crippled
and
tied
up
in
bundles
of
the
pain
was
martyrizing
like
that
of
men
tied
to
burning
fagots
for
conscience
sake
in
one
battalion
of
the
west
riding
division
there
were
over
four
hundred
cases
in
that
winter
of
other
battalions
in
the
ypres
salient
suffered
as
much
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
winter
when
oil
was
taken
up
to
the
trenches
and
rubbing
drill
was
ordered
two
or
three
times
a
day
that
the
malady
of
was
reduced
and
at
last
almost
eliminated
the
spirit
of
the
men
fought
against
all
that
misery
resisted
it
and
would
not
be
beaten
by
it
a
sergeant
of
the
west
riding
division
was
badly
wounded
as
he
stood
in
water
a
bomb
or
a
smashed
one
of
his
legs
into
a
pulp
of
bloody
flesh
and
splintered
bone
word
was
passed
down
to
the
field
ambulance
and
a
surgeon
came
up
splashed
to
the
neck
in
mud
with
his
instruments
held
high
the
operation
was
done
in
the
water
red
with
the
blood
of
the
wounded
man
who
was
then
brought
down
less
a
leg
to
the
field
hospital
he
was
put
on
one
side
as
a
man
about
to
die
but
that
evening
he
chattered
cheerfully
joked
with
the
priest
who
came
to
anoint
him
and
wrote
a
letter
to
his
wife
i
hope
this
will
find
you
in
the
pink
as
it
leaves
me
he
began
he
mentioned
that
he
had
had
an
accident
which
had
taken
one
of
his
legs
away
but
the
youngsters
will
like
to
play
with
my
wooden
peg
he
wrote
and
discussed
the
joke
of
it
the
people
round
his
bed
marveled
at
him
though
day
after
day
they
saw
great
courage
such
courage
as
that
of
another
man
who
was
brought
in
mortally
wounded
and
lay
next
to
a
comrade
on
the
operating
table
stick
it
lad
he
said
stick
it
and
turned
his
head
a
little
to
look
at
his
friend
many
of
our
camps
were
hardly
better
than
the
trenches
only
by
could
one
walk
about
the
morass
in
which
huts
were
built
and
tents
were
pitched
in
the
wagon
lines
gunners
tried
in
vain
to
groom
their
horses
and
floundered
about
in
their
gum
boots
cursing
the
mud
which
clogged
bits
and
chains
and
bridles
and
could
find
no
comfort
anywhere
between
dickebusch
and
locre
iv
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
near
fosse
captured
by
the
scottish
division
in
the
battle
of
loos
could
not
be
held
then
under
concentrated
from
german
batteries
and
the
scots
and
the
guards
who
followed
them
after
heavy
losses
could
only
cling
on
to
part
of
a
communication
trench
on
the
southeast
side
of
the
earthworks
nicknamed
big
willie
near
another
trench
called
little
our
enemies
forced
their
way
back
into
some
of
their
old
trenches
in
this
outpost
beyond
their
main
lines
and
in
spite
of
the
chaos
produced
by
our
built
up
new
parapets
and
barricades
flung
out
barbed
wire
and
dug
themselves
into
this
graveyard
where
their
dead
and
ours
were
strewn
perhaps
there
was
some
reason
why
our
generals
should
covet
possession
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
some
good
military
reason
beyond
the
spell
of
a
name
i
went
up
there
one
day
when
it
was
partly
ours
and
stared
at
its
rigid
waves
of
and
trench
parapets
and
upheaved
chalk
dazzling
white
under
a
blue
sky
and
failed
to
see
any
beauty
in
the
spot
or
any
value
in
it
so
close
to
the
german
lines
that
one
could
not
cough
for
fear
of
losing
one
head
it
seemed
to
me
a
place
not
to
gain
and
not
to
hold
if
i
had
been
a
general
appalling
thought
i
should
have
said
let
the
enemy
have
that
little
hell
of
his
let
men
live
there
among
bodies
and
crawling
lice
and
the
stench
of
rotting
flesh
there
is
no
good
in
it
for
us
and
for
him
will
be
an
abomination
dreaded
by
his
but
our
generals
desired
it
they
hated
to
think
that
the
enemy
should
have
crawled
back
to
it
after
our
men
had
been
there
they
decided
to
bite
it
off
that
blunt
nose
which
was
thrust
forward
to
our
line
it
was
an
operation
that
would
be
good
to
report
in
the
official
communique
its
capture
would
no
doubt
increase
the
morale
of
our
men
after
their
dead
had
been
buried
and
their
wounded
patched
up
and
their
losses
forgotten
it
was
to
the
midland
division
that
the
order
of
assault
was
given
on
october
and
into
the
trenches
went
the
of
nottingham
and
the
potters
of
the
five
towns
and
the
of
leicester
north
staffordshires
and
robin
hoods
and
sherwood
foresters
on
the
night
of
the
on
the
following
morning
our
artillery
concentrated
a
tremendous
fire
upon
the
redoubt
followed
at
by
volumes
of
smoke
and
gas
the
chief
features
on
this
part
of
the
german
line
were
on
the
right
a
group
of
colliers
houses
known
as
the
corons
de
pekin
and
a
slag
heap
known
as
the
dump
to
the
northeast
of
that
bigger
dump
called
fosse
and
on
the
left
another
group
of
cottages
and
another
black
hillock
farther
to
the
right
of
the
fosse
these
positions
were
in
advance
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
which
our
troops
were
to
attack
it
was
not
an
easy
task
it
was
hellish
intense
as
our
artillery
fire
had
been
it
failed
to
destroy
the
enemy
barbed
wire
and
front
trenches
sufficiently
to
clear
the
way
and
the
germans
were
still
working
their
when
the
fuses
were
lengthened
the
fire
lifted
and
the
rolled
away
i
saw
that
bombardment
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
october
and
the
beginning
of
the
attack
from
a
slag
heap
close
to
some
of
our
heavy
guns
it
was
a
fine
clear
day
and
some
of
the
french
miners
living
round
the
on
our
side
of
the
battle
line
climbed
up
iron
ladders
and
coal
heaps
roused
to
a
new
interest
in
the
spectacle
of
war
which
had
become
a
monotonous
and
familiar
thing
in
their
lives
because
the
intensity
of
our
and
the
volumes
of
and
a
certain
strange
whitish
vapor
which
was
wafted
from
our
lines
toward
the
enemy
stirred
their
imagination
dulled
by
the
daily
din
of
guns
to
a
sense
of
something
beyond
the
usual
flight
of
shells
in
their
part
of
the
war
zone
the
english
are
attacking
again
was
the
message
which
brought
out
these
men
still
living
among
ruined
cottages
on
the
edge
of
the
they
stared
into
the
mist
where
beyond
the
brightness
of
the
autumn
sun
men
were
about
to
fight
and
die
it
was
the
same
scene
that
i
had
watched
when
i
went
up
to
the
loos
redoubt
in
the
september
battle
a
flat
bare
black
plain
crisscrossed
with
the
whitish
earth
of
the
trenches
rising
a
little
toward
loos
and
then
falling
again
so
that
in
the
village
there
only
the
tower
bridge
was
visible
with
its
steel
girders
glinting
high
over
the
horizon
line
to
the
left
the
ruins
of
hulluch
fretted
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
beyond
a
huddle
of
broken
houses
far
away
was
the
town
of
haisnes
fosse
and
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
were
hummocks
of
earth
faintly
visible
through
drifting
clouds
of
thick
sluggish
vapor
on
the
edge
of
this
battleground
the
fields
were
tawny
under
the
golden
light
of
the
autumn
sun
and
the
broken
towers
of
village
churches
red
roofs
shattered
by
trees
stripped
bare
of
all
leaves
before
the
wind
of
autumn
touched
them
were
painted
in
clear
outlines
against
the
of
the
sky
our
guns
had
been
invisible
not
one
of
all
those
batteries
which
were
massed
over
a
wide
stretch
of
country
could
be
located
before
the
battle
by
a
searching
glass
but
when
the
bombardment
began
it
seemed
as
though
our
shells
came
from
every
field
and
village
for
miles
back
behind
the
lines
the
glitter
of
those
bursting
shells
stabbed
through
the
smoke
of
their
explosion
with
little
twinkling
flashes
like
the
sparkle
of
innumerable
mirrors
heliographing
messages
of
death
there
was
one
incessant
roar
rising
and
falling
in
waves
of
prodigious
sound
the
whole
line
of
battle
was
in
a
grayish
murk
which
obscured
all
landmarks
so
that
even
the
tower
bridge
was
but
faintly
visible
presently
when
our
artillery
lifted
there
were
new
clouds
rising
from
the
ground
and
spreading
upward
in
a
great
dense
curtain
of
a
fleecy
texture
they
came
from
our
which
were
to
mask
our
infantry
attack
through
them
and
beyond
them
rolled
another
wave
of
cloud
a
thinner
whiter
vapor
which
clung
to
the
ground
and
then
curled
forward
to
the
enemy
lines
that
our
gas
said
a
voice
on
one
of
the
slag
heaps
amid
a
group
of
observers
english
and
french
officers
and
the
wind
is
dead
right
for
it
said
another
voice
the
germans
will
get
a
taste
of
it
this
time
then
there
was
silence
and
some
of
those
observers
held
their
breath
as
though
that
gas
had
caught
their
own
throats
and
choked
them
a
little
they
tried
to
pierce
through
that
bar
of
cloud
to
see
the
drama
behind
its
curtain
men
caught
in
those
fumes
the
flight
before
its
advance
the
sudden
cry
of
the
enemy
trapped
in
their
dugouts
imagination
leaped
out
through
invisibility
to
the
realization
of
the
things
that
were
happening
beyond
from
our
place
of
observation
there
were
brief
glimpses
of
the
human
element
in
this
scene
of
impersonal
powers
and
secret
forces
across
a
stretch
of
flat
ground
beyond
some
of
those
zigzag
lines
of
trenches
little
black
things
were
scurrying
forward
they
were
not
bunched
together
in
close
groups
but
scattered
some
of
them
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
to
fall
and
lie
where
they
fell
others
hurrying
on
until
they
disappeared
in
the
drifting
clouds
it
was
the
foremost
line
of
our
infantry
attack
led
by
the
bombers
the
germans
were
firing
tempests
of
shells
some
of
them
were
curiously
colored
of
a
pinkish
hue
or
with
puffs
of
vivid
green
they
were
giving
out
noxious
gases
all
the
chemistry
of
death
was
poured
out
on
both
sides
and
through
it
went
the
men
of
the
midland
division
the
attack
on
the
right
was
delivered
by
a
brigade
of
staffordshire
men
who
advanced
in
four
lines
toward
the
big
willie
trench
which
formed
the
southeast
side
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
the
leading
companies
who
were
first
over
our
own
parapets
made
a
quick
rush
half
blinded
by
the
smoke
and
the
gaseous
vapors
which
filled
the
air
and
were
at
once
received
by
a
deadly
fire
from
many
it
swept
their
ranks
and
men
fell
on
all
sides
others
ran
on
in
little
parties
flung
out
in
extended
order
young
officers
behaved
with
desperate
gallantry
and
as
they
fell
cheered
their
men
on
while
others
ran
forward
shouting
followed
by
numbers
which
dwindled
at
every
yard
so
that
only
a
few
reached
the
big
willie
trench
in
the
first
assault
a
of
north
staffordshire
men
cleared
thirty
yards
of
the
trench
by
the
rapidity
with
which
they
flung
their
at
the
german
bombers
who
endeavored
to
keep
them
out
and
again
and
again
they
kept
at
bay
a
tide
of
men
who
swarmed
up
the
communication
trenches
by
a
series
of
explosions
which
blew
many
of
them
to
bits
as
bomb
after
bomb
was
hurled
into
their
mass
other
germans
followed
flinging
their
own
the
staffordshires
did
not
yield
until
nearly
every
man
was
wounded
and
many
were
killed
even
then
they
retreated
yard
by
yard
still
flinging
grenades
almost
with
the
rhythm
of
a
sower
who
scatters
his
seed
each
motion
of
the
hand
and
arm
letting
go
one
of
those
steel
pomegranates
which
burst
with
the
noise
of
a
shell
the
survivors
fell
back
to
the
other
side
of
a
barricade
made
in
the
big
willie
trench
by
some
of
their
men
behind
behind
them
again
was
another
barrier
in
case
the
first
should
be
rushed
it
seemed
as
if
they
might
be
rushed
now
for
the
germans
were
swarming
up
big
willie
with
strong
and
would
soon
blast
a
way
through
unless
they
were
thrust
beyond
the
range
of
it
was
a
young
lieutenant
named
hawker
with
some
south
staffordshire
men
who
went
forward
to
meet
this
attack
and
kept
the
enemy
back
until
four
in
the
afternoon
when
only
a
few
living
men
stood
among
the
dead
and
they
had
to
fall
back
to
the
second
barrier
darkness
now
crept
over
the
battlefield
and
filled
the
trenches
and
in
the
darkness
the
wounded
men
were
carried
back
to
the
rear
while
those
who
had
escaped
worked
hard
to
strengthen
their
defenses
by
and
earthworks
knowing
that
their
only
chance
of
life
lay
in
fierce
industry
early
next
morning
an
attempt
was
made
by
other
battalions
to
come
to
the
relief
of
those
who
held
on
behind
those
barriers
in
big
willie
trench
they
were
nottingham
men
robin
hoods
and
other
sherwood
lads
and
they
came
across
the
open
ground
in
two
directions
attacking
the
west
as
well
as
the
east
ends
of
the
german
communication
trenches
which
formed
the
face
of
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
they
were
supported
by
rifle
but
their
advance
was
met
by
intense
fire
from
artillery
and
so
that
many
were
blown
to
bits
or
mangled
or
maimed
and
none
could
reach
their
comrades
in
big
willie
trench
while
one
brigade
of
the
midland
men
had
been
fighting
like
this
on
the
right
another
brigade
had
been
engaged
on
the
left
it
contained
sherwood
leicester
and
lincoln
men
who
on
the
afternoon
of
october
went
forward
to
the
assault
with
very
desperate
endeavor
advancing
in
four
lines
the
leading
companies
were
successful
in
reaching
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
smashed
through
the
barbed
wire
part
of
which
was
uncut
and
reached
the
fosse
trench
which
forms
the
north
base
of
the
salient
fire
cut
down
the
first
two
lines
severely
and
the
two
remaining
lines
were
heavily
shelled
by
german
artillery
it
was
an
hour
in
which
the
courage
of
those
men
was
agonized
they
were
exposed
on
naked
ground
swept
by
bullets
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
gas
and
smoke
all
the
abomination
of
battle
he
moaning
of
the
wounded
the
last
cries
of
the
dying
the
of
stricken
beings
holding
their
broken
limbs
and
their
entrails
was
around
them
and
in
front
a
hidden
enemy
with
unlimited
supplies
of
ammunition
and
a
better
position
the
robin
hoods
and
the
men
of
lincoln
and
leicestershire
were
sustained
in
that
shambles
by
the
spirit
that
had
come
to
them
through
the
old
yeoman
stock
in
which
their
traditions
were
rooted
and
those
who
had
not
fallen
went
forward
past
their
wounded
comrades
past
these
poor
bloody
moaning
men
to
the
german
trenches
behind
the
redoubt
at
some
monmouth
men
came
up
in
support
and
while
their
bombers
were
at
work
some
of
the
lincolns
pushed
up
with
a
to
a
point
within
sixty
yards
from
the
fosse
trench
where
they
stayed
till
dark
and
then
were
forced
to
fall
back
at
this
time
parties
of
bombers
were
trying
to
force
their
way
up
the
little
willie
trench
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
redoubt
and
here
ghastly
fighting
took
place
some
of
the
leicesters
made
a
dash
three
hundred
yards
up
the
trench
but
were
beaten
back
by
overpowering
numbers
of
german
bombers
and
and
again
and
again
other
midland
lads
went
up
that
alleyway
of
death
flinging
their
grenades
until
they
fell
or
until
few
comrades
were
left
to
support
them
as
they
stood
among
their
dead
and
dying
single
men
held
on
throwing
and
throwing
until
there
was
no
strength
in
their
arms
to
hurl
another
bomb
or
until
death
came
to
them
yet
the
business
went
on
through
the
darkness
of
the
afternoon
and
into
the
deeper
darkness
of
the
night
lit
luridly
at
moments
by
the
white
illumination
of
german
flares
and
by
the
flash
of
bursting
shells
isolated
in
uncaptured
parts
of
the
redoubt
still
beat
a
tattoo
like
the
ruffle
of
and
from
behind
the
barriers
in
the
big
willie
trench
came
the
sharp
crack
of
english
rifles
and
dull
explosions
of
other
bombs
flung
by
other
englishmen
very
hard
pressed
that
night
in
the
outer
trenches
at
the
nose
of
the
salient
fresh
companies
of
sherwood
lads
were
feeling
their
way
along
mixed
up
confusedly
with
comrades
from
other
companies
wounded
or
spent
with
fighting
but
determined
to
hold
the
ground
they
had
won
some
of
the
robin
hoods
up
little
willie
trench
were
holding
out
desperately
and
almost
at
the
last
gasp
when
they
were
relieved
by
other
sherwoods
and
it
was
here
that
a
young
officer
named
vickers
was
found
in
the
way
that
won
him
his
charles
geoffrey
vickers
stood
there
for
hours
against
a
horde
of
men
eager
for
his
death
eager
to
get
at
the
men
behind
him
but
they
could
not
approach
he
and
his
kept
twenty
yards
or
more
clear
before
them
and
any
man
who
flung
himself
forward
was
the
target
of
a
from
front
and
from
flank
german
bombs
came
whizzing
falling
short
sometimes
with
a
blasting
roar
that
tore
down
lumps
of
trench
and
sometimes
falling
very
close
close
enough
to
kill
vickers
saw
some
of
his
best
men
fall
but
he
kept
the
barrier
still
intact
by
bombing
and
bombing
when
many
of
his
comrades
were
dead
or
wounded
he
wondered
how
long
the
barrier
would
last
and
gave
orders
for
another
to
be
built
behind
him
so
that
when
the
rush
came
it
would
be
stopped
behind
him
and
over
him
men
worked
at
that
barricade
piling
up
and
as
it
was
built
that
young
lieutenant
knew
that
his
own
retreat
was
being
cut
off
and
that
he
was
being
coffined
in
that
narrow
space
two
other
men
were
with
him
i
never
learned
their
names
and
they
were
hardly
enough
to
hand
up
bombs
as
quickly
as
he
wished
to
throw
them
away
there
up
the
trench
the
germans
were
waiting
for
a
pounce
though
wounded
so
that
he
felt
faint
and
giddy
he
called
out
for
more
bombs
more
he
said
more
and
his
hand
was
like
a
machine
reaching
out
and
throwing
rescue
came
at
last
and
the
wounded
officer
was
hauled
over
the
barricade
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
built
behind
him
closing
up
his
way
of
escape
all
through
october
the
midland
men
of
the
division
held
on
to
their
ground
and
some
of
the
sherwoods
made
a
new
attack
clearing
the
enemy
out
of
the
east
portion
of
the
redoubt
it
was
lucky
that
it
coincided
with
a
made
by
the
enemy
at
a
different
point
because
it
relieved
the
pressure
there
bombing
duels
continued
hour
after
hour
and
human
nature
could
hardly
have
endured
so
long
a
struggle
without
fatigue
beyond
the
strength
of
men
so
it
seems
yet
when
a
brigade
of
guards
came
up
on
the
night
of
october
the
enemy
attacked
along
the
whole
line
of
redoubts
and
the
midland
men
who
were
just
about
to
leave
the
trenches
found
themselves
engaged
in
a
new
action
they
had
to
fight
again
before
they
could
go
and
they
fought
like
demons
or
demigods
for
their
right
of
way
and
home
and
bombed
the
enemy
back
to
his
holes
in
the
ground
so
ended
the
assault
on
the
hohenzollern
by
the
midland
men
of
england
whose
division
years
later
helped
to
break
the
hindenburg
line
along
the
great
canal
south
of
what
good
came
of
it
mortal
men
can
not
say
unless
the
generals
who
planned
it
hold
the
secret
it
cost
a
heavy
price
in
life
and
agony
it
demonstrated
the
fighting
spirit
of
many
english
boys
who
did
the
best
they
could
with
the
rage
and
fear
and
madness
of
great
courage
before
they
died
or
fell
and
it
left
some
living
men
and
others
who
relieved
them
in
big
willie
and
little
willie
trenches
so
close
to
the
enemy
that
one
could
hear
them
cough
or
swear
in
guttural
whispers
and
through
the
winter
of
and
the
years
that
followed
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
became
another
hooge
as
horrible
as
hooge
as
deadly
as
damnable
in
its
filthy
perils
where
men
of
english
blood
and
irish
and
scottish
took
their
turn
and
hated
it
and
counted
themselves
lucky
if
they
escaped
from
its
whose
walls
stank
of
new
and
ancient
death
among
those
who
took
their
turn
in
the
hell
of
the
hohenzollern
were
the
men
of
the
division
new
army
men
and
all
of
the
old
stock
and
spirit
of
england
bred
in
the
shires
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
gloucester
and
bedford
and
in
surrey
kent
sussex
and
middlesex
which
meant
london
as
the
names
of
their
battalions
told
in
september
they
relieved
the
guards
and
cavalry
at
loos
in
december
they
moved
on
to
givenchy
and
in
february
they
began
a
long
spell
at
the
hohenzollern
it
was
there
the
english
battalions
learned
the
worst
things
of
war
and
showed
the
quality
of
english
courage
a
man
of
kent
named
corporal
cotter
of
the
buffs
was
marvelous
in
spirit
stronger
than
the
flesh
on
the
night
of
march
an
attack
was
made
by
his
company
along
an
enemy
trench
but
his
own
bombing
party
was
cut
off
owing
to
heavy
casualties
in
the
center
of
the
attack
things
looked
serious
and
cotter
went
back
under
heavy
fire
to
report
and
bring
up
more
bombs
on
the
return
journey
his
right
leg
was
blown
off
close
below
the
knee
and
he
was
wounded
in
both
arms
by
a
kind
of
miracle
the
miracle
of
human
courage
he
did
not
drop
down
and
die
in
the
mud
of
the
trench
mud
so
deep
that
unwounded
men
found
it
hard
to
walk
but
made
his
way
along
fifty
yards
of
trench
toward
the
crater
where
his
comrades
were
hard
pressed
he
came
up
to
newman
who
was
bombing
with
his
sector
to
the
right
of
the
position
cotter
called
to
him
and
directed
him
to
bomb
six
feet
toward
where
help
was
most
needed
and
worked
his
way
forward
to
the
crater
where
the
germans
had
developed
a
violent
men
fell
rapidly
under
the
enemy
but
cotter
with
only
one
leg
and
bleeding
from
both
arms
steadied
his
comrades
who
were
beginning
to
have
the
as
they
say
issued
orders
controlled
the
fire
and
then
altered
dispositions
to
meet
the
attack
it
was
repulsed
after
two
hours
fighting
and
only
then
did
cotter
allow
his
wounds
to
be
bandaged
from
the
dug
out
where
he
lay
while
the
bombardment
still
continued
he
called
out
cheery
words
to
the
men
until
he
was
carried
down
fourteen
hours
later
he
received
the
but
died
of
his
wounds
officers
and
men
vied
with
one
another
yet
not
for
honor
or
reward
round
these
craters
of
the
hohenzollern
and
in
the
mud
and
the
fumes
of
shells
and
darkness
and
all
the
black
horror
of
such
a
time
and
place
sometimes
in
groups
and
sometimes
quite
alone
did
acts
of
supreme
valor
when
all
the
men
in
one
of
these
infernal
craters
were
dead
or
wounded
lieut
lea
smith
of
the
buffs
ran
forward
with
a
lewis
gun
helped
by
private
bradley
and
served
it
during
a
fierce
attack
by
german
bombers
until
it
jammed
then
he
left
the
gun
and
took
to
bombing
and
that
single
figure
of
his
flinging
grenades
like
an
overarm
bowler
kept
the
enemy
at
bay
until
reinforcements
reached
him
another
officer
of
the
buff
by
name
smeltzer
withdrew
his
platoon
under
heavy
fire
and
although
he
was
wounded
fought
his
way
back
slowly
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
following
up
the
men
were
proud
of
his
gallantry
but
when
he
was
asked
what
he
had
done
he
could
think
of
nothing
except
that
when
the
boches
began
shelling
i
got
into
a
dugout
and
when
they
stopped
i
came
out
there
were
many
men
like
that
who
did
amazing
things
and
in
the
english
way
said
nothing
of
them
of
that
modesty
was
capt
augrere
dawson
of
the
west
kents
who
did
not
bother
much
about
a
bullet
he
met
on
his
way
to
a
crater
though
it
traveled
through
his
chest
to
his
he
had
it
dressed
and
then
went
back
to
lead
his
men
and
remained
with
them
until
the
german
night
attack
was
repulsed
he
was
again
wounded
this
time
in
the
thigh
but
did
not
trouble
the
they
had
a
lot
to
do
on
the
night
of
march
and
and
trudged
back
alone
it
was
valor
that
was
paid
for
by
flesh
and
blood
the
honors
gained
by
the
division
in
a
few
months
of
trench
warfare
one
sixteen
military
crosses
military
medals
were
won
by
the
loss
in
casualties
of
more
than
fourteen
thousand
men
that
is
to
say
the
losses
of
their
division
in
that
time
made
up
by
new
drafts
was
per
cent
and
the
hohenzollern
took
the
highest
toll
of
life
and
limbs
v
i
heard
no
carols
in
the
trenches
on
christmas
eve
in
but
afterward
when
i
sat
with
a
pint
of
water
in
each
of
my
among
a
company
of
men
who
were
wet
to
the
knees
and
slathered
with
moist
mud
a
friend
of
mine
raised
his
hand
and
said
listen
through
the
open
door
came
the
music
of
a
mouth
organ
and
it
was
playing
an
old
tune
god
rest
ye
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
for
jesus
christ
our
saviour
was
born
on
christmas
day
outside
the
wind
was
howling
across
flanders
with
a
doleful
whine
rising
now
and
then
into
a
savage
violence
which
rattled
the
and
beyond
the
booming
of
its
lower
notes
was
the
faint
dull
rumble
of
distant
guns
christmas
eve
said
an
officer
nineteen
hundred
and
fifteen
years
ago
and
now
this
he
sighed
heavily
and
a
few
moments
later
told
a
funny
story
which
was
followed
by
loud
laughter
and
so
it
was
i
think
in
every
billet
in
flanders
and
in
every
dugout
that
christmas
eve
where
men
thought
of
the
meaning
of
the
day
with
its
message
of
peace
and
goodwill
and
contrasted
it
with
the
great
grim
horror
of
the
war
and
spoke
a
few
words
of
perplexity
and
then
after
that
quick
sigh
how
many
comrades
had
gone
since
last
christmas
day
caught
at
a
jest
and
had
the
courage
of
laughter
it
was
queer
to
find
the
spirit
of
christmas
the
little
tendernesses
of
the
old
tradition
the
toys
and
trinkets
of
its
in
places
where
death
had
been
busy
and
where
the
spirit
of
evil
lay
in
ambush
so
it
was
when
i
went
through
armentieres
within
easy
range
of
the
enemy
guns
already
six
hundred
civilians
mostly
women
and
children
had
been
killed
there
but
still
other
women
were
chatting
together
through
broken
and
children
were
staring
into
little
shops
only
a
few
yards
away
from
broken
roofs
and
walls
where
christmas
toys
were
on
sale
a
wizened
boy
in
a
pair
of
soldier
boots
a
french
hop
o
my
thumb
in
the
giant
boots
was
gazing
wistfully
at
some
tin
soldiers
and
inside
the
shop
a
real
soldier
not
a
bit
like
the
tin
one
was
buying
some
christmas
cards
worked
by
a
french
artist
in
colored
wools
for
the
benefit
of
english
tommies
with
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
other
soldiers
read
their
legends
and
laughed
at
them
my
heart
is
to
good
to
the
success
remind
the
man
who
was
buying
the
cards
fumbled
with
french
money
and
looked
up
sheepishly
at
me
as
if
shy
of
the
sentiment
upon
which
he
was
spending
it
the
people
at
home
will
be
glad
of
he
said
i
one
forget
christmas
altogether
though
it
ai
the
same
thing
out
going
in
search
of
christmas
i
passed
through
a
flooded
countryside
and
found
only
scenes
of
war
behind
the
lines
with
gunners
driving
their
batteries
and
limber
down
a
road
that
had
become
a
fountains
of
spray
rising
about
their
mules
and
wheels
military
lurching
in
the
mud
beyond
the
pave
in
a
wild
way
through
boggy
tracks
supply
columns
churning
up
deep
ruts
and
then
into
the
trenches
at
neuve
chapelle
if
santa
claus
had
come
that
way
remembering
those
boys
of
ours
the
old
man
with
his
white
beard
must
have
lifted
his
red
gown
high
when
he
waded
up
some
of
the
communication
trenches
to
the
and
he
would
have
staggered
and
slithered
now
with
one
deep
in
sludge
now
with
the
other
slipping
off
the
trench
boards
into
five
feet
of
water
as
i
had
to
do
grasping
with
futile
hands
at
slimy
sandbags
to
save
a
headlong
plunge
into
icy
water
and
this
old
man
of
peace
who
loved
all
boys
and
the
laughter
of
youth
would
have
had
to
duck
very
low
and
make
sudden
bolts
across
open
spaces
where
parapets
and
earthworks
had
silted
down
in
order
to
avoid
those
sniping
bullets
which
came
snapping
across
the
dead
ground
from
a
row
of
slashed
trees
and
a
few
scarred
ruins
on
the
edge
of
the
lines
but
sentiment
of
that
sort
was
out
of
place
in
trenches
less
than
a
hundred
yards
away
from
men
lying
behind
rifles
and
waiting
to
kill
there
was
no
spirit
of
christmas
in
the
tragic
desolation
of
the
scenery
of
which
i
had
brief
glimpses
when
i
stood
here
and
there
nakedly
i
felt
in
those
ugly
places
when
the
officer
who
was
with
me
said
best
to
get
a
move
on
here
and
this
road
is
swept
by
machine
gun
fire
and
i
do
like
this
corner
it
quite
but
that
absurd
idea
of
santa
claus
in
the
trenches
came
into
my
head
several
times
and
i
wondered
whether
the
germans
would
fire
a
at
him
or
give
a
burst
of
fire
if
they
caught
the
glint
of
his
red
cloak
some
of
the
soldiers
had
the
same
idea
in
the
trench
a
small
group
of
yorkshire
lads
were
chaffing
one
another
going
to
hang
your
boots
up
outside
the
dugout
asked
a
lad
grinning
down
at
an
enormous
pair
of
waders
belonging
to
a
comrade
likely
ai
it
said
the
other
boy
father
christmas
would
be
a
bloody
fool
to
come
out
here
they
be
full
of
water
in
the
you
get
some
presents
i
said
they
have
forgotten
you
at
at
that
word
home
the
boy
flushed
and
something
went
soft
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
in
spite
of
his
steel
helmet
and
uniform
he
was
a
fellow
perhaps
that
was
why
his
comrades
were
chaffing
him
and
i
fancy
the
thought
of
christmas
made
him
yearn
back
to
some
village
in
yorkshire
most
of
the
other
men
with
whom
i
spoke
treated
the
idea
of
christmas
with
contemptuous
irony
a
happy
christmas
said
one
of
them
with
a
laugh
plenty
of
crackers
about
this
year
tom
smith
ai
in
and
i
hope
we
going
to
give
the
boches
some
christmas
presents
said
another
they
deserve
it
i
do
think
no
truce
this
year
i
asked
a
truce
we
not
going
to
allow
any
monkey
tricks
on
the
parapets
to
hell
with
christmas
charity
and
all
that
tosh
we
got
to
get
on
with
the
war
that
my
other
men
said
we
would
mind
a
holiday
we
fed
up
to
the
neck
with
all
this
the
war
did
not
stop
although
it
was
christmas
eve
and
the
only
carol
i
heard
in
the
trenches
was
the
loud
deep
chant
of
the
guns
on
both
sides
and
the
shrill
soprano
of
whistling
shells
and
the
rattle
on
the
keyboards
of
the
enemy
was
putting
more
shells
into
a
bit
of
trench
in
revenge
for
a
raid
to
the
left
some
shrapnel
shells
were
bursting
and
behind
the
lines
our
heavies
were
busily
at
work
firing
at
long
range
on
earth
peace
toward
the
message
was
spoken
at
many
a
little
service
on
both
sides
of
that
long
line
where
great
armies
were
entrenched
with
their
and
the
riddle
of
life
and
faith
was
rung
out
by
the
christmas
bells
which
came
clashing
on
the
wind
with
the
reverberation
of
great
guns
through
the
night
our
men
in
the
trenches
stood
in
their
waders
and
the
dawn
of
christmas
day
was
greeted
not
by
angelic
songs
but
by
the
splutter
of
all
along
the
line
vi
there
was
more
than
half
a
gale
blowing
on
the
eve
of
the
new
year
and
the
wind
came
howling
with
a
savage
violence
across
the
fields
so
that
the
first
day
of
a
fateful
year
had
a
stormy
birth
and
there
was
no
peace
on
earth
louder
than
the
wind
was
the
greeting
of
the
guns
to
another
year
of
war
i
heard
the
chorus
when
i
went
to
see
the
last
of
the
year
across
the
battlefields
our
guns
did
not
let
it
die
in
silence
it
went
into
the
tomb
of
the
past
with
all
its
tragic
memories
to
thunderous
salvos
carrying
death
with
them
the
heavies
were
indulging
in
a
special
strafe
this
new
year
eve
as
i
went
down
a
road
near
the
lines
by
loos
i
saw
from
concealed
positions
the
flash
of
gun
upon
gun
the
air
was
swept
by
an
incessant
rush
of
shells
and
the
roar
of
all
this
artillery
stupefied
one
sense
of
sound
all
about
me
in
the
village
of
annequin
through
which
i
walked
there
was
no
other
sound
no
noise
of
human
life
there
were
no
eve
rejoicings
among
those
rows
of
miners
cottages
on
the
edge
of
the
battlefield
half
those
little
houses
were
blown
to
pieces
and
when
here
and
there
through
a
cracked
i
saw
a
white
face
peering
out
upon
me
as
i
passed
i
felt
as
though
i
had
seen
a
in
some
black
pit
of
hell
for
it
was
hellish
this
place
wrecked
by
high
explosives
and
always
under
the
fire
of
german
guns
that
any
human
being
should
be
there
passed
all
belief
from
a
in
a
high
wall
i
looked
across
the
field
of
battle
where
many
of
our
best
had
died
the
tower
bridge
of
loos
stood
grim
and
gaunt
above
the
sterile
fields
through
the
rain
and
the
mist
loomed
the
long
black
ridge
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
where
many
poor
bodies
lay
in
the
rotting
leaves
the
ruins
of
haisnes
and
hulluch
were
jagged
against
the
and
here
on
new
year
eve
i
saw
no
sign
of
human
life
and
heard
no
sound
of
it
but
stared
at
the
broad
desolation
and
listened
to
the
enormous
clangor
of
great
guns
coming
back
that
day
through
bethune
i
met
some
very
human
life
it
was
a
big
party
of
bluejackets
from
the
grand
fleet
who
had
come
to
see
what
tommy
was
doing
in
the
war
they
went
into
the
trenches
and
saw
a
good
deal
because
the
germans
made
a
bombing
raid
in
that
sector
and
the
naval
men
did
their
little
bit
by
the
side
of
the
lads
in
khaki
who
liked
this
visit
they
discovered
the
bomb
store
and
opened
such
a
brock
benefit
that
the
enemy
must
have
been
shocked
with
surprise
one
young
marine
was
for
four
hours
and
grinned
at
the
prodigious
memory
as
though
he
had
had
the
time
of
his
life
another
confessed
to
me
that
he
preferred
which
he
fired
off
all
night
until
the
dawn
there
was
no
sleep
in
the
dugouts
and
every
hour
was
a
long
thrill
i
do
mind
saying
said
a
petty
officer
who
had
fought
in
several
naval
actions
during
the
war
and
is
a
man
of
mark
that
i
had
a
fair
fright
when
i
was
doing
duty
on
the
suppose
i
got
to
look
through
a
periscope
i
said
you
said
the
sergeant
night
you
puts
your
head
over
the
parapet
so
over
the
parapet
i
put
my
head
and
presently
i
saw
something
moving
between
the
lines
my
rifle
began
to
shake
germans
moving
sure
enough
over
the
open
ground
i
fixed
bayonet
and
prepared
for
an
attack
but
i
blessed
if
it
a
swarm
of
rats
the
soldiers
were
glad
to
show
jack
the
way
about
the
trenches
and
some
of
them
played
up
a
little
audaciously
as
for
instance
when
a
young
fellow
sat
on
the
top
of
the
parapet
at
dawn
come
up
and
have
a
look
jack
he
said
to
one
of
the
bluejackets
not
in
these
trousers
old
mate
said
that
young
man
all
as
cool
as
cucumbers
said
a
petty
officer
and
take
the
discomforts
of
trench
life
as
cheerily
as
any
men
could
it
marvelous
good
luck
to
them
in
the
new
year
behind
the
lines
there
was
banqueting
by
men
who
were
mostly
doomed
to
die
and
i
joined
a
crowd
of
them
in
a
hall
at
lillers
on
that
day
they
were
the
heroes
of
loos
or
some
of
them
camerons
and
seaforths
argyll
and
sutherland
highlanders
gordons
and
king
own
scottish
borderers
who
with
the
london
men
were
first
on
hill
and
away
to
the
cite
they
left
many
comrades
there
and
their
battalions
have
been
filled
up
with
new
drafts
of
the
same
type
as
themselves
and
of
the
same
grit
but
that
day
no
ghost
of
grief
no
dark
shadow
of
gloom
was
upon
any
of
the
faces
upon
which
i
looked
round
a
festive
board
in
a
long
french
hall
to
which
their
wounded
came
in
those
days
of
the
september
battle
there
were
young
men
there
from
the
scottish
universities
and
from
highland
farms
sitting
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
a
jolly
comradeship
which
burst
into
song
between
every
mouthful
of
the
feast
on
the
platform
above
the
a
piper
was
playing
when
i
came
in
and
this
hall
in
france
was
filled
with
the
wild
strains
of
it
and
they
grand
the
pipes
said
one
of
the
camerons
when
been
sae
tired
on
the
march
i
could
have
laid
doon
an
dee
the
touch
o
the
pipes
has
fair
lifted
me
up
the
piper
made
way
for
a
kiltie
at
the
piano
and
for
highlanders
who
sang
old
songs
full
of
melancholy
which
seemed
to
make
the
hearts
of
his
comrades
grow
glad
as
when
they
helped
him
with
the
bonnie
bonnie
banks
of
loch
but
the
roof
nearly
flew
off
the
hall
to
the
march
of
the
cameron
men
and
the
walls
were
greatly
strained
when
the
regimental
marching
song
broke
at
every
verse
into
wild
highland
shouts
and
the
which
was
heard
at
loos
of
camerons
forward
forward
camerons
an
englishman
is
good
said
one
of
the
camerons
leaning
over
the
table
to
me
and
an
irishman
is
good
but
a
scot
is
the
best
of
then
he
struck
the
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
fist
of
another
but
the
london
men
he
said
with
a
fine
joyous
laugh
at
some
good
memory
are
as
good
as
any
in
france
my
word
ye
should
have
seen
on
september
and
the
london
irish
were
just
lions
out
in
the
street
i
met
the
colonel
of
a
battalion
of
argylls
and
sutherlands
with
several
of
his
officers
a
tall
thin
officer
with
a
long
stride
who
was
killed
when
another
year
had
passed
he
beckoned
to
me
and
said
i
going
the
rounds
of
the
billets
to
wish
the
men
good
luck
in
the
new
year
it
a
strain
on
the
constitution
as
i
have
to
drink
their
health
each
time
he
bore
the
strain
gallantly
and
there
was
something
noble
and
chivalrous
in
the
way
he
spoke
to
all
his
men
gathered
together
in
various
rooms
in
old
flemish
houses
round
from
home
or
feasts
provided
by
the
army
cooks
to
each
group
of
men
he
made
the
same
kind
of
speech
thanking
them
from
his
heart
for
all
their
courage
you
were
thanked
by
three
generals
he
said
after
your
attack
at
loos
and
you
upheld
the
old
reputation
of
the
regiment
i
proud
of
you
and
afterward
in
november
when
you
had
the
devil
of
a
time
in
the
trenches
you
stuck
it
splendidly
and
came
out
with
high
spirits
i
wish
you
all
a
happy
new
year
and
whatever
the
future
may
bring
i
know
i
can
count
on
in
every
billet
there
were
three
cheers
for
the
colonel
and
another
three
for
the
staff
captain
and
though
the
colonel
protested
that
he
was
afraid
of
spending
a
night
in
the
there
were
shouts
of
laughter
at
this
he
drank
his
sip
of
neat
whisky
according
to
the
custom
of
the
day
old
bird
said
a
kilted
cockney
halfway
up
a
ladder
on
which
he
swayed
perilously
being
very
drunk
but
the
colonel
did
not
hear
this
familiar
way
of
address
in
many
billets
and
in
many
halls
the
feast
of
new
year
day
was
kept
in
good
comradeship
by
men
who
had
faced
death
together
and
who
in
the
year
that
was
coming
fought
in
many
battles
and
fell
on
many
fields
vii
the
canadians
who
were
in
the
ypres
salient
in
january
and
for
a
long
time
afterward
had
a
grim
way
of
fighting
the
enemy
never
knew
what
they
might
do
next
when
they
were
most
quiet
they
were
most
dangerous
they
used
cunning
as
well
as
courage
and
went
out
on
adventures
over
no
man
land
for
fierce
and
scientific
slaughter
i
remember
one
of
their
early
raids
in
the
salient
when
a
big
party
of
them
all
volunteers
went
out
one
night
with
intent
to
get
through
the
barbed
wire
outside
a
strong
german
position
to
do
a
lot
of
killing
there
they
had
trained
for
the
job
and
thought
out
every
detail
of
this
hunting
expedition
they
blacked
their
faces
so
that
they
would
not
show
white
in
the
enemy
flares
they
fastened
to
their
bayonets
so
that
they
might
see
their
victims
they
wore
rubber
gloves
to
save
their
hands
from
being
torn
on
the
barbs
of
the
wire
stealthily
they
crawled
over
no
man
land
crouching
in
every
time
a
rocket
rose
and
made
a
glimmer
of
light
they
took
their
time
at
the
wire
muffling
the
snap
of
it
by
bits
of
cloth
reliefs
crawled
up
with
more
gloves
and
even
with
tins
of
hot
cocoa
then
through
the
gap
into
the
german
trenches
and
there
were
screams
of
german
soldiers
by
the
flash
of
light
in
their
eyes
and
black
faces
above
them
and
bayonets
already
red
with
blood
it
was
butcher
work
quick
and
skilful
like
scalping
thirty
germans
were
killed
before
the
canadians
went
back
with
only
two
casualties
the
germans
were
horrified
by
this
sudden
slaughter
they
dared
not
come
out
on
patrol
work
canadian
scouts
crawled
down
to
them
and
insulted
them
ingeniously
vilely
but
could
get
no
answer
later
they
trained
their
machine
guns
on
german
and
swept
crossroads
on
which
supplies
came
up
and
the
canadian
sniper
in
one
or
another
lay
for
hours
in
sulky
patience
and
at
last
got
his
man
they
had
to
pay
for
all
this
at
maple
copse
in
june
of
as
i
shall
tell
but
it
was
a
vendetta
which
did
not
end
until
the
war
ended
and
the
canadians
fought
the
germans
with
a
long
enduring
terrible
skilful
patience
which
at
last
brought
them
to
mons
on
the
day
before
armistice
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
canadians
from
first
to
last
and
on
many
days
of
battle
saw
the
tough
hard
fighting
spirit
of
these
men
their
generals
believed
in
common
sense
applied
to
war
and
not
in
high
mysteries
and
secret
rites
which
can
not
be
known
outside
the
circle
of
initiation
i
was
impressed
by
general
currie
whom
i
met
for
the
first
time
in
that
winter
of
and
wrote
at
the
time
that
i
saw
in
him
a
leader
of
men
who
in
open
warfare
might
win
great
victories
by
doing
the
thing
rapidly
and
decisively
to
the
surprise
of
an
enemy
working
by
elaborate
science
he
would
i
think
astound
them
by
the
simplicity
of
his
smashing
those
words
of
mine
were
fulfilled
on
the
day
when
the
canadians
helped
to
break
the
line
and
when
they
captured
cambrai
with
english
troops
on
their
right
who
shared
their
success
general
currie
who
became
the
canadian
corps
commander
did
not
spare
his
men
he
led
them
forward
whatever
the
cost
but
there
was
something
great
and
terrible
in
his
simplicity
and
sureness
of
judgment
and
this
real
estate
agent
as
he
was
before
he
took
to
soldiering
was
undoubtedly
a
man
of
strong
ability
free
from
those
trammels
of
red
tape
and
tradition
which
swathed
round
so
many
of
our
own
leaders
he
cut
clean
to
the
heart
of
things
ruthlessly
like
a
surgeon
and
as
i
watched
that
man
immense
in
bulk
with
a
heavy
thoughtful
face
and
stern
eyes
that
softened
a
little
when
he
smiled
i
thought
of
him
as
oliver
cromwell
he
was
severe
as
a
disciplinarian
and
not
beloved
by
many
men
but
his
who
stood
in
awe
of
him
knew
that
he
demanded
truth
and
honesty
and
that
his
brain
moved
quickly
to
sure
decisions
and
saw
big
problems
broadly
and
with
understanding
he
had
good
men
with
him
mostly
amateurs
but
with
hard
business
heads
and
the
same
hatred
of
red
tape
and
niggling
ways
which
belonged
to
their
chief
so
the
canadian
corps
became
a
powerful
engine
on
our
side
when
it
had
learned
many
lessons
in
blood
and
tragedy
they
organized
their
publicity
side
in
the
same
masterful
way
and
were
determined
that
what
canada
did
the
world
should
know
and
damn
all
censorship
they
bought
up
english
artists
photographers
and
writing
men
to
record
their
exploits
with
lord
beaverbrook
in
england
they
engineered
canadian
propaganda
with
immense
energy
and
canada
believed
her
men
made
up
the
british
army
and
did
all
the
fighting
i
do
not
blame
them
and
only
wish
that
the
english
soldier
should
have
been
given
his
share
of
the
honors
that
belonged
to
him
the
lion
share
viii
the
canadians
were
not
the
only
men
to
go
out
raiding
it
became
part
of
the
routine
of
war
that
quick
killing
in
the
night
for
english
and
scottish
and
irish
and
welsh
troops
and
some
had
luck
with
it
and
some
men
liked
it
and
to
others
it
was
a
horror
which
they
had
to
do
and
always
it
was
a
fluky
nervy
job
when
any
accident
might
lead
to
tragedy
i
remember
one
such
raid
by
the
west
yorks
in
january
of
which
was
typical
of
many
others
before
raids
developed
into
minor
battles
with
all
the
guns
at
work
there
were
four
lieutenants
who
drew
up
the
plan
and
called
for
volunteers
and
it
was
one
of
these
who
went
out
first
and
alone
to
reconnoiter
the
ground
and
to
find
the
best
way
through
the
german
barbed
wire
he
just
slipped
out
over
the
parapet
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
when
he
came
back
he
had
a
wound
in
the
wrist
it
was
just
the
bad
luck
of
a
chance
bullet
but
brought
in
valuable
knowledge
he
had
found
a
gap
in
the
enemy
wire
which
would
give
an
open
door
to
the
party
of
visitors
he
had
also
tested
the
wire
farther
along
and
thought
it
could
be
cut
without
much
bother
good
enough
was
the
verdict
and
a
detachment
started
out
for
no
man
land
divided
into
two
parties
the
enemy
trenches
were
about
one
hundred
yards
away
which
seems
a
mile
in
the
darkness
and
the
loneliness
of
the
dead
ground
at
regular
intervals
the
german
rockets
flared
up
so
that
the
hedges
and
wire
and
parapets
along
their
line
were
cut
out
against
the
white
illumination
and
the
two
patrols
of
yorkshiremen
who
had
been
crawling
forward
stopped
and
crouched
lower
and
felt
themselves
revealed
and
then
when
darkness
hid
them
again
went
on
the
party
on
the
left
were
now
close
to
the
german
wire
and
under
the
shelter
of
a
hedge
they
felt
their
way
along
until
the
two
subalterns
who
were
leading
came
to
the
gap
which
had
been
reported
by
the
first
explorer
they
listened
intently
and
heard
the
german
sentry
stamping
his
feet
and
pacing
up
and
down
presently
he
began
to
whistle
softly
utterly
unconscious
of
the
men
so
close
to
him
so
close
now
that
any
stumble
any
clatter
of
arms
any
word
spoken
would
betray
them
the
two
lieutenants
had
their
revolvers
ready
and
crept
forward
to
the
parapet
the
men
had
to
act
according
to
instinct
now
for
no
order
could
be
given
and
one
of
them
found
his
instinct
led
him
to
clamber
right
into
the
german
trench
a
few
yards
away
from
the
sentry
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
traverse
he
had
not
been
there
long
holding
his
breath
and
crouching
like
a
wolf
before
footsteps
came
toward
him
and
he
saw
the
glint
of
a
cigarette
it
was
a
german
officer
going
his
round
the
yorkshire
boy
sprang
on
to
the
parapet
again
and
lay
across
it
with
his
head
toward
our
lines
and
his
legs
dangling
in
the
german
trench
the
german
officer
cloak
brushed
his
heels
but
the
boy
twisted
round
a
little
and
stared
at
him
as
he
passed
but
he
passed
and
presently
the
sentry
began
to
whistle
again
some
old
german
tune
which
cheered
him
in
his
loneliness
he
knew
nothing
of
the
eyes
watching
him
through
the
darkness
nor
of
his
nearness
to
death
it
was
the
first
lieutenant
who
tried
to
shoot
him
but
the
revolver
was
muddy
and
would
not
fire
perhaps
a
click
disturbed
the
sentry
anyhow
the
moment
had
come
for
quick
work
it
was
the
sergeant
who
sprang
upon
him
down
from
the
parapet
with
one
pounce
a
frightful
shriek
with
the
shrill
agony
of
a
boy
voice
wailed
through
the
silence
the
sergeant
had
his
hand
about
the
german
boy
throat
and
tried
to
strangle
him
and
to
stop
another
dreadful
cry
the
second
officer
made
haste
he
thrust
his
revolver
close
to
the
struggling
sentry
and
shot
him
dead
through
the
neck
just
as
he
was
falling
limp
from
a
blow
on
the
head
given
by
the
of
the
weapon
which
had
failed
to
fire
the
bullet
did
its
work
though
it
passed
through
the
sergeant
hand
which
had
still
held
the
man
by
the
throat
the
alarm
had
been
raised
and
german
soldiers
were
running
to
the
rescue
quick
said
one
of
the
officers
there
was
a
wild
scramble
over
the
parapet
a
drop
into
the
wet
ditch
and
a
race
for
home
over
no
man
land
which
was
white
under
the
german
flares
and
noisy
with
the
waspish
note
of
bullets
the
other
party
were
longer
away
and
had
greater
trouble
to
find
a
way
through
but
they
too
got
home
with
one
officer
badly
wounded
and
wonderful
luck
to
escape
so
lightly
the
enemy
suffered
from
the
jumps
for
several
nights
afterward
and
threw
bombs
into
their
own
barbed
wire
as
though
the
english
were
out
there
again
and
at
the
sound
of
those
bombs
the
west
yorks
laughed
all
along
their
trenches
ix
it
was
always
astonishing
though
afterward
familiar
in
those
battlefields
of
flanders
to
find
oneself
in
the
midst
of
so
many
nationalities
and
races
and
breeds
of
men
belonging
to
that
british
family
of
ours
which
sent
its
sons
to
sacrifice
in
those
trenches
there
were
all
the
ways
of
speech
all
the
sentiment
of
place
and
history
all
the
creeds
and
local
customs
and
songs
of
old
tradition
which
belong
to
the
mixture
of
our
blood
wherever
it
is
found
about
the
world
the
skirl
of
the
scottish
bagpipes
was
heard
through
all
the
years
of
war
over
the
flemish
marshlands
and
there
were
highlanders
and
lowlanders
with
every
dialect
over
the
border
in
one
line
of
trenches
the
german
soldiers
listened
to
sung
in
such
trained
harmony
that
it
was
as
if
a
battalion
of
had
come
into
the
the
welshmen
spoke
their
own
language
for
a
time
no
officer
received
his
command
unless
he
spoke
it
as
fluently
as
running
water
by
aberystwyth
and
even
orders
were
given
in
this
tongue
until
a
few
saxons
discovered
in
the
ranks
failed
to
form
fours
and
know
their
left
hand
from
their
right
in
welsh
the
did
not
need
to
learn
the
language
of
the
peasants
in
these
market
towns
soldiers
from
somerset
used
many
old
saxon
words
which
puzzled
their
cockney
friends
and
the
lancashire
men
brought
the
northern
bur
with
them
and
the
grit
of
the
northern
spirit
and
ireland
though
she
would
not
have
conscription
sent
some
of
the
bravest
of
her
boys
out
there
and
in
all
the
bloodiest
battles
since
that
day
at
mons
the
old
fighting
qualities
of
the
irish
race
shone
brightly
again
and
the
blood
of
her
race
has
been
poured
out
upon
these
tragic
fields
one
of
the
villages
behind
the
lines
of
arras
was
so
crowded
with
irish
boys
at
the
beginning
of
that
i
found
it
hard
not
to
believe
that
a
part
of
old
ireland
itself
had
found
its
way
to
flanders
in
one
old
outhouse
the
cattle
had
not
been
evicted
twelve
flemish
cows
lay
cuddled
up
together
on
the
ground
floor
in
damp
straw
which
gave
out
a
sweet
sickly
stench
while
the
irish
soldiers
lived
upstairs
in
the
loft
to
which
they
climbed
up
a
tall
ladder
with
broken
rungs
i
went
up
the
ladder
after
them
it
was
very
shaky
in
the
middle
and
putting
my
head
through
the
loft
gave
a
greeting
to
a
number
of
dark
figures
lying
in
the
same
kind
of
straw
that
i
had
smelled
downstairs
one
boy
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
beams
playing
a
penny
whistle
very
softly
to
himself
or
perhaps
to
the
rats
under
the
straws
the
craytures
are
that
bold
said
a
boy
from
county
cork
that
when
we
first
came
in
they
sat
up
smilin
and
sang
save
ireland
bedad
and
it
the
truth
i
after
tellin
the
billets
were
wet
and
dirty
but
it
was
good
to
be
away
from
the
shells
even
if
the
rain
came
through
the
beams
of
a
broken
roof
and
soaked
through
the
plaster
of
wattle
walls
the
irish
boys
were
good
at
making
wood
fires
in
these
old
barns
and
pigsties
if
there
were
a
few
bricks
about
to
make
a
hearth
and
sure
a
baked
potato
was
no
protestant
with
a
grudge
against
the
pope
there
were
no
such
luxuries
in
the
trenches
when
the
dublins
and
the
munsters
were
up
in
the
at
the
hohenzollern
the
shelling
was
so
violent
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
up
the
supplies
and
some
of
the
boys
had
to
fall
back
on
their
iron
rations
it
was
the
only
complaint
which
one
of
them
made
when
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
his
first
experience
under
fire
it
was
all
right
sorr
and
not
so
bad
as
i
been
after
thinking
if
only
my
appetite
had
not
been
bigger
than
my
belt
at
the
spirit
of
these
irishmen
was
shown
by
some
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
old
country
to
join
their
comrades
in
the
when
the
germans
put
over
a
number
of
shells
smashing
the
trenches
and
wounding
men
the
temper
of
the
lads
broke
out
and
they
wanted
to
get
over
the
parapet
and
make
a
dash
for
the
enemy
taych
him
a
lesson
they
told
their
officers
who
had
some
trouble
in
restraining
them
these
newcomers
had
to
take
part
in
the
digging
which
goes
on
behind
the
lines
at
night
out
in
the
open
without
the
shelter
of
a
trench
it
was
nervous
work
especially
when
the
german
flares
went
up
silhouetting
their
figures
on
the
and
when
one
of
the
enemy
began
to
chatter
but
the
irish
boys
found
the
heart
for
a
jest
and
one
of
them
resting
on
his
spade
a
moment
stared
over
to
the
lines
and
said
may
the
old
devil
take
the
spalpeen
who
works
that
typewriter
it
was
a
scaring
time
for
those
who
had
come
fresh
to
the
trenches
some
of
those
boys
who
had
not
guessed
the
realities
of
war
until
then
but
they
came
out
proudly
with
their
tails
up
said
one
of
their
officers
after
their
baptism
of
fire
the
band
of
the
munsters
was
practising
in
an
old
barn
on
the
wayside
and
presently
in
honor
of
visitors
who
were
myself
and
another
the
pipers
were
sent
for
they
were
five
tall
lads
who
came
striding
down
the
street
of
flemish
cottages
with
the
windbags
under
their
arms
and
then
with
the
fife
men
sitting
on
the
straw
around
them
and
the
drummers
standing
with
their
sticks
ready
they
took
their
breath
for
the
good
old
irish
tune
demanded
by
the
captain
it
was
a
tune
which
men
could
not
sing
very
safely
in
irish
yesterdays
and
it
held
the
passion
of
many
rebellious
hearts
and
the
yearning
of
them
oh
paddy
dear
and
did
you
hear
the
news
that
going
round
the
shamrock
is
forbid
by
law
to
grow
on
irish
ground
she
the
most
distressful
country
that
ever
yet
was
seen
hanging
men
and
women
there
for
wearing
of
the
green
then
the
pipers
played
the
march
of
a
wild
old
air
as
shrill
and
fierce
as
the
spirit
of
the
men
who
came
with
their
irish
against
elizabeth
pikemen
and
cromwell
ironsides
i
thought
then
that
the
lads
who
still
stayed
back
in
ireland
and
the
old
people
there
would
have
been
glad
to
stand
with
me
outside
that
flemish
barn
and
to
hear
the
old
tunes
of
their
race
played
by
the
boys
who
were
out
there
fighting
i
think
they
would
have
wept
a
little
as
i
saw
tears
in
the
eyes
of
an
irish
soldier
by
my
side
for
it
was
the
spirit
of
ireland
herself
with
all
her
poetry
and
her
valor
and
her
faith
in
liberty
which
came
crying
from
those
pipes
and
i
wished
that
the
sound
of
them
could
carry
across
the
sea
that
was
a
year
before
i
saw
the
irish
battalions
come
out
of
guichy
a
poor
remnant
of
the
strength
that
had
gone
in
all
tattered
and
torn
and
caked
with
the
filth
of
battle
and
hardly
able
to
stagger
along
but
they
pulled
themselves
up
a
little
and
turned
eyes
left
when
they
passed
their
brigadier
who
called
out
words
of
praise
to
them
it
was
more
than
a
year
later
than
that
when
i
saw
the
last
of
them
after
a
battle
in
flanders
when
they
were
massacred
and
lay
in
heaps
round
german
redoubts
up
there
in
the
swamps
x
early
in
the
morning
of
february
there
was
a
clear
sky
with
a
glint
of
sun
in
it
and
airplanes
were
aloft
as
though
it
would
be
a
good
but
before
midday
the
sky
darkened
and
snow
began
to
fall
and
then
it
snowed
steadily
for
hours
so
that
all
the
fields
of
flanders
were
white
there
was
a
strange
new
beauty
in
the
war
zone
which
had
changed
all
the
pictures
of
war
by
a
white
enchantment
the
villages
where
our
soldiers
were
billeted
looked
as
though
they
were
expecting
a
visit
from
santa
claus
the
snow
lay
thick
on
the
thatch
and
in
soft
downy
ridges
on
the
roofs
it
covered
with
its
purity
the
rubbish
heaps
in
flemish
farmyards
and
the
old
oak
beams
of
barns
and
sheds
where
british
soldiers
made
their
beds
of
straw
away
over
the
lonely
country
which
led
to
the
trenches
every
furrow
in
the
fields
was
a
thin
white
ridge
and
the
trees
which
were
just
showing
a
shimmer
of
green
stood
against
the
drifting
with
a
long
white
streak
down
each
tall
trunk
on
the
side
nearest
to
the
wind
the
old
windmills
of
flanders
which
looked
down
upon
the
battlefields
had
been
touched
by
the
softly
falling
flakes
so
that
each
rib
of
their
sails
and
each
rung
of
their
ladders
and
each
plank
of
their
ancient
timbers
was
outlined
like
a
frosty
cobweb
along
the
roads
of
war
our
soldiers
tramped
through
the
blizzard
with
ermine
mantles
over
their
mackintosh
capes
and
mounted
men
with
their
heads
bent
to
the
storm
were
like
white
knights
riding
through
a
white
wilderness
the
long
columns
of
the
gun
limbers
drawn
up
by
their
batteries
the
field
ambulances
by
the
clearing
hospitals
were
all
cloaked
in
snow
and
the
tramp
and
traffic
of
an
army
were
hushed
in
the
great
quietude
in
the
trenches
the
snow
fell
thickly
and
made
white
pillows
of
the
piled
and
of
sentries
standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
traverses
the
tarpaulin
roofs
and
timbered
doorways
of
dugouts
were
so
changed
by
the
snowflakes
that
they
seemed
the
of
fairy
folks
or
at
least
of
pierrot
and
columbine
in
a
christmas
and
not
of
soldiers
stamping
their
feet
and
blowing
on
their
fingers
and
keeping
their
rifles
dry
in
its
first
glamour
of
white
the
snow
gave
a
beauty
even
to
no
land
making
a
pattern
of
barbed
wire
and
lying
very
softly
over
the
tumbled
ground
of
so
that
all
the
ugliness
of
destruction
and
death
was
hidden
under
this
canopy
the
snowflakes
fluttered
upon
stark
bodies
there
and
shrouded
them
tenderly
it
was
as
though
all
the
doves
of
peace
were
flying
down
to
fold
their
wings
above
the
obscene
things
of
war
for
a
little
while
the
snow
brought
something
like
peace
the
guns
were
quieter
for
artillery
observation
was
impossible
there
could
be
no
sniping
for
the
scurrying
flakes
put
a
veil
between
the
trenches
the
airplanes
which
went
up
in
the
morning
came
down
quickly
to
the
powdered
fields
and
took
shelter
in
their
sheds
a
great
hush
was
over
the
war
zone
but
there
was
something
grim
suggestive
of
tragic
drama
in
this
silent
countryside
so
white
even
in
the
darkness
where
millions
of
men
were
waiting
to
kill
one
another
behind
the
lines
the
joke
of
the
snow
was
seen
by
soldiers
who
were
quick
to
see
a
chance
of
fun
men
who
had
been
hurling
bombs
in
the
ypres
salient
bombarded
one
another
with
which
burst
noiselessly
except
for
the
shouts
of
laughter
that
signaled
a
good
hit
french
soldiers
were
at
the
same
game
in
one
village
i
passed
where
the
was
fast
and
furious
and
some
of
our
officers
led
an
attack
upon
old
comrades
with
the
craft
of
trappers
and
an
expert
knowledge
of
enfilade
fire
the
white
peace
did
not
last
long
the
ermine
mantle
on
the
battlefield
was
stained
by
scarlet
patches
as
soon
as
men
could
see
to
fight
again
xi
for
some
days
in
that
february
of
the
war
correspondents
in
the
chateau
of
tilques
from
which
they
made
their
expeditions
to
the
line
were
snowed
up
like
the
army
round
them
not
even
the
could
move
through
that
snow
which
drifted
across
the
roads
we
sat
indoors
talking
high
treason
sometimes
pondering
over
the
problem
of
a
war
from
which
there
seemed
no
way
out
becoming
irritable
with
one
another
company
becoming
passionate
in
argument
about
the
ethics
of
war
the
purpose
of
man
the
gospel
of
christ
the
guilt
of
germany
and
the
dishonesty
of
british
politicians
futile
foolish
arguments
while
men
were
being
killed
in
great
numbers
as
daily
routine
without
result
officers
of
a
division
billeted
nearby
came
in
to
dine
with
us
some
of
them
generals
with
elaborate
theories
on
war
and
a
passionate
hatred
of
germany
seeing
no
other
evil
in
the
world
some
of
them
brigadiers
with
tales
of
appalling
brutality
which
caused
great
laughter
some
of
them
battalion
officers
with
the
point
of
view
of
those
who
said
morituri
te
saluant
there
was
one
whose
conversation
i
remember
having
taken
notes
of
it
before
i
turned
in
that
night
it
was
a
remarkable
conversation
summing
up
many
things
of
the
same
kind
which
i
had
heard
in
stray
sentences
by
other
officers
and
month
by
month
years
afterward
heard
again
spoken
with
passion
this
officer
who
had
come
out
to
france
in
and
had
been
fighting
ever
since
by
a
luck
which
had
spared
his
life
when
so
many
of
his
comrades
had
fallen
round
him
did
not
speak
with
passion
he
spoke
with
a
bitter
mocking
irony
he
said
that
was
a
close
corporation
in
the
hands
of
the
military
clique
who
had
muddled
through
the
south
african
war
and
were
now
going
to
muddle
through
a
worse
one
they
were
he
said
intrenched
behind
impregnable
barricades
of
old
traditions
red
tape
and
caste
privilege
they
were
of
course
patriots
who
believed
that
the
empire
depended
upon
their
system
they
had
no
doubt
of
their
inherent
right
to
conduct
the
war
which
was
their
war
without
interference
or
criticism
or
publicity
they
spent
many
hours
of
the
days
and
nights
in
writing
letters
to
one
another
and
those
who
wrote
most
letters
received
most
decorations
and
felt
with
a
patriotic
fire
within
their
breasts
that
they
were
getting
on
with
the
war
within
their
close
corporation
there
were
rivalries
intrigues
perjuries
and
treacheries
like
those
of
a
medieval
court
each
general
and
had
his
followers
and
his
sycophants
who
jostled
for
one
another
jobs
fawned
on
the
great
man
flattered
his
vanity
and
made
him
believe
in
his
omniscience
among
the
general
staff
there
were
various
grades
i
ii
iii
and
those
in
the
lower
grades
fought
for
a
higher
grade
with
every
kind
of
artfulness
and
diplomacy
and
influence
they
worked
late
into
the
night
that
is
to
say
they
went
back
to
their
offices
after
dining
at
mess
so
frightfully
busy
you
know
old
man
and
kept
their
lights
burning
and
smoked
more
cigarettes
and
rang
one
another
up
on
the
telephone
with
futile
questions
and
invented
new
ways
of
preventing
something
from
being
down
somewhere
the
war
to
them
was
a
thing
essential
to
their
way
of
life
as
miners
in
the
are
essential
to
statesmen
in
downing
street
especially
in
cold
weather
but
it
did
not
touch
their
souls
or
their
bodies
they
did
not
see
its
agony
or
imagine
it
or
worry
about
it
they
were
always
cheerful
breezy
bright
with
optimism
they
made
a
little
work
go
a
long
way
they
were
haughty
and
arrogant
with
subordinate
officers
or
at
the
best
affable
and
condescending
and
to
superior
officers
they
said
yes
sir
no
sir
quite
so
sir
to
any
statement
however
absurd
in
its
ignorance
and
dogmatism
if
a
said
wagner
was
a
mountebank
in
music
iii
who
had
once
studied
at
munich
said
yes
sir
or
you
think
so
sir
of
course
you
if
a
said
browning
was
not
a
poet
a
staff
captain
who
had
read
browning
at
cambridge
with
passionate
admiration
said
i
quite
agree
with
you
sir
and
who
do
you
think
was
a
poet
sir
it
was
the
army
system
the
opinion
of
a
superior
officer
was
correct
always
it
did
not
admit
of
contradiction
it
was
not
to
be
criticized
its
ignorance
was
wisdom
lived
said
our
guest
in
a
world
of
its
own
remote
from
the
ugly
things
of
war
they
had
heard
of
the
trenches
yes
but
as
the
west
end
hears
of
the
east
end
a
nasty
place
where
common
people
lived
occasionally
they
visited
the
trenches
as
society
folk
go
slumming
and
came
back
proud
of
having
seen
a
shell
burst
having
braved
the
lice
and
the
dirt
the
trenches
are
the
slums
said
our
guest
we
are
the
great
unwashed
we
are
the
there
was
a
trench
in
the
salient
called
j
it
was
away
out
in
advance
of
our
lines
it
was
not
connected
with
our
own
trench
system
it
had
been
left
derelict
by
both
sides
and
was
a
ditch
in
no
land
but
our
men
were
ordered
to
hold
it
to
save
a
battalion
commander
protested
to
the
headquarters
staff
there
was
no
object
in
holding
j
it
was
a
target
for
german
guns
and
a
temptation
to
german
miners
j
came
the
staff
command
must
be
held
until
further
we
lost
five
hundred
men
in
holding
it
the
trench
and
all
in
it
were
thrown
up
by
mines
among
those
killed
was
the
hon
lyndhurst
bruce
the
husband
of
camille
clifford
with
other
husbands
of
women
unknown
our
guest
told
the
story
of
the
massacre
in
neuve
chapelle
this
is
a
death
sentence
said
the
officers
who
were
ordered
to
attack
but
they
attacked
and
died
with
great
gallantry
as
usual
in
the
slums
said
our
guest
we
are
expected
to
die
if
tells
us
so
or
if
the
corps
arranges
our
funeral
and
generally
we
that
night
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
i
listened
to
the
rumbling
of
the
gunning
away
in
the
salient
and
seemed
to
hear
the
groans
of
men
at
hooge
at
in
other
awful
places
the
irony
of
that
guest
of
ours
was
frightful
it
was
bitter
beyond
justice
though
with
truth
in
the
mockery
the
truth
of
a
soul
shocked
by
the
waste
of
life
and
heroism
when
i
met
him
later
in
the
war
he
was
on
the
staff
xii
the
world
our
side
of
it
held
its
breath
and
felt
its
own
when
in
february
of
that
year
the
armies
of
the
german
crown
prince
launched
their
offensive
against
the
french
at
verdun
it
was
the
biggest
offensive
since
their
first
drive
down
to
the
marne
and
as
the
days
passed
and
they
hurled
fresh
masses
of
men
against
the
french
and
brought
up
new
guns
to
replace
their
losses
there
was
no
doubt
that
in
this
battle
the
germans
were
trying
by
all
their
weight
to
smash
their
way
to
victory
through
the
walls
which
the
french
had
built
against
them
by
living
flesh
and
spirit
will
they
hold
was
the
question
which
every
man
among
us
asked
of
his
neighbor
and
of
his
soul
on
our
front
there
was
nothing
of
war
beyond
the
daily
routine
of
the
trenches
and
the
daily
list
of
deaths
and
wounds
winter
had
closed
down
upon
us
in
flanders
and
through
its
fogs
and
snows
came
the
news
of
that
conflict
round
verdun
to
the
waiting
army
which
was
ours
the
news
was
bad
yet
not
the
worst
poring
over
maps
of
the
french
front
we
in
our
winter
quarters
saw
with
secret
terror
some
of
us
with
a
bluster
of
false
optimism
some
of
us
with
unjustified
despair
that
the
french
were
giving
ground
giving
ground
slowly
after
heroic
resistance
after
dreadful
massacre
and
steadily
they
were
falling
back
to
the
inner
line
of
forts
hard
pressed
the
germans
in
spite
of
monstrous
losses
under
the
flail
of
the
were
forcing
their
way
from
slope
to
slope
capturing
positions
which
all
but
dominated
the
whole
of
the
verdun
heights
if
the
french
break
we
shall
lose
the
war
said
the
pessimist
the
french
will
never
lose
verdun
said
the
optimist
why
not
what
are
your
reasons
beyond
that
cursed
optimism
which
has
been
our
ruin
why
announce
things
like
that
as
though
divinely
inspired
for
god
sake
let
us
stare
straight
at
the
the
germans
are
losing
the
war
by
this
attack
on
verdun
they
are
just
pouring
their
best
soldiers
into
the
furnace
burning
the
flower
of
their
army
it
is
our
gain
it
will
lead
in
the
end
to
our
but
my
dear
good
fool
what
about
the
french
losses
do
they
get
killed
too
the
german
artillery
is
flogging
them
with
from
guns
every
bloody
and
monstrous
engine
the
french
are
weak
in
heavy
artillery
for
that
error
which
has
haunted
them
from
the
beginning
they
are
now
paying
with
their
life
blood
the
life
blood
of
you
are
arguing
on
emotion
and
fear
have
you
learned
yet
that
the
attacking
side
always
loses
more
than
the
defense
that
is
a
sweeping
statement
it
depends
on
relative
and
given
a
superiority
of
guns
and
men
and
attack
is
cheap
defense
is
blown
off
the
earth
otherwise
how
could
we
ever
hope
to
win
i
agree
but
the
forces
at
verdun
are
about
equal
and
the
french
have
the
advantage
of
position
the
germans
are
committing
humbug
they
know
what
they
are
doing
they
are
the
greatest
soldiers
in
led
by
men
with
bone
by
great
by
the
traditional
rules
of
medievalism
by
bald
headed
vultures
in
spectacles
with
brains
like
machines
put
in
a
penny
and
out
comes
a
rule
of
war
mad
egoists
colossal
blunderers
efficient
in
all
things
but
knowledge
of
then
god
help
our
british
a
long
silence
the
silence
of
men
who
see
monstrous
forces
at
work
in
which
human
lives
are
tossed
like
straws
in
flame
a
silence
reaching
back
to
old
ghosts
of
history
reaching
out
to
supernatural
aid
then
from
one
speaker
or
another
a
kind
of
curse
and
a
kind
of
prayer
hell
god
help
us
all
so
it
was
in
our
mess
where
war
correspondents
and
censors
sat
down
together
after
futile
journeys
to
dirty
places
to
see
a
bit
of
a
few
dead
bodies
a
line
of
german
trenches
through
a
periscope
a
queue
of
wounded
men
outside
a
dressing
station
the
survivors
of
a
trench
raid
a
bombardment
before
a
minor
operation
a
stunt
a
new
part
of
the
line
verdun
was
the
only
thing
that
mattered
in
march
and
april
until
france
had
saved
herself
and
all
of
us
xiii
the
british
army
took
no
part
in
that
battle
of
verdun
but
rendered
great
service
to
france
at
that
time
by
february
of
we
had
taken
over
a
new
line
of
front
extending
from
our
positions
round
loos
southward
to
the
country
round
lens
and
arras
it
was
to
this
movement
in
february
that
marshal
joffre
made
allusion
when
in
a
message
to
our
on
march
he
said
that
the
french
army
remembered
that
its
recent
call
on
the
comradeship
of
the
british
army
met
with
an
immediate
and
complete
by
liberating
an
immense
number
of
french
troops
of
the
tenth
army
and
a
mass
of
artillery
from
this
part
of
the
front
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
of
great
service
to
france
at
a
time
when
she
needed
many
men
and
guns
to
repel
the
assault
upon
verdun
some
of
her
finest
troops
men
who
had
fought
in
many
battles
and
had
held
the
trenches
with
most
dogged
courage
were
here
in
this
sector
of
the
western
front
and
many
batteries
of
heavy
and
light
artillery
had
been
in
these
positions
since
the
early
months
of
the
war
it
was
therefore
giving
a
new
and
formidable
strength
to
the
defense
of
verdun
when
british
troops
replaced
them
at
the
time
the
enemy
made
his
great
attack
the
french
went
away
from
this
part
of
their
battlefront
with
regret
and
emotion
to
them
it
was
sacred
ground
this
line
from
the
long
ridge
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
past
arras
the
old
capital
of
artois
to
hebuterne
where
it
linked
up
with
the
british
army
already
on
the
somme
every
field
here
was
a
graveyard
of
their
heroic
dead
i
went
over
all
the
ground
which
we
now
held
and
saw
the
visible
reminders
of
all
that
fighting
which
lay
strewn
there
and
told
the
story
of
all
the
struggle
there
by
the
upheaval
of
earth
the
wreckage
of
old
trenches
the
mine
craters
and
and
the
litter
of
battle
in
every
part
of
that
countryside
i
went
there
first
to
the
hill
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
looking
northward
to
lens
and
facing
the
vimy
ridge
which
the
enemy
held
as
a
strong
barrier
against
us
above
the
village
of
souchez
and
ablain
and
neuville
which
the
french
had
captured
when
they
were
still
there
and
i
am
glad
of
that
for
i
saw
in
their
places
the
men
who
had
lived
there
and
fought
there
as
one
may
read
in
the
terrible
and
tragic
narrative
of
war
by
henri
barbusse
in
le
feu
i
went
on
such
a
day
as
barbusse
describes
never
once
did
he
admit
any
fine
weather
to
alleviate
the
suffering
of
his
comrades
thereby
exaggerating
their
misery
somewhat
it
was
raining
and
there
was
a
white
dank
mist
through
the
trees
of
the
bois
de
bouvigny
on
the
way
to
the
spur
of
notre
dame
it
clung
to
the
undergrowth
which
was
torn
by
and
to
every
blade
of
grass
growing
rankly
round
the
lips
of
in
which
were
bits
of
red
rag
or
old
bones
the
red
pantaloons
of
the
first
french
armies
who
had
fought
through
those
woods
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
i
roamed
about
a
graveyard
there
where
shells
had
smashed
down
some
of
the
crosses
but
had
not
damaged
the
memorial
to
the
men
who
had
stormed
up
the
slope
of
notre
dame
de
lorette
and
had
fallen
when
their
comrades
chased
the
germans
to
the
village
below
a
few
shells
came
over
the
hill
as
i
pushed
through
the
undergrowth
with
a
french
captain
and
they
burst
among
the
trees
with
shattering
boughs
i
remember
that
little
officer
in
a
steel
helmet
and
i
could
see
a
norman
knight
as
his
ancestor
with
a
falcon
as
his
crest
he
stood
so
often
on
the
in
full
view
of
the
enemy
i
was
thankful
for
the
mist
that
i
admired
but
deplored
his
audacity
without
any
screen
to
hide
us
we
walked
down
the
hillside
gathering
clots
of
greasy
mud
in
our
boots
stumbling
and
once
sprawling
another
french
captain
joined
us
and
became
the
guide
this
road
is
often
he
said
but
i
have
escaped
so
often
i
have
a
kind
of
i
envied
his
faith
remembering
two
shells
which
a
few
minutes
before
had
burst
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
cutting
off
twigs
of
trees
and
one
branch
with
a
scatter
of
steel
as
sharp
as
knives
and
as
heavy
as
then
for
the
first
time
i
went
into
ablain
which
afterward
i
passed
through
scores
of
times
on
the
way
to
vimy
when
that
ridge
was
ours
the
ragged
ruin
of
its
church
was
white
and
ghostly
in
the
mist
on
the
right
of
the
winding
road
which
led
through
it
was
souchez
wood
all
blasted
and
riven
and
beyond
a
huddle
of
bricks
which
once
was
souchez
village
our
men
have
fallen
on
every
yard
of
this
ground
said
the
french
officer
their
bodies
lie
thick
below
the
soil
poor
france
poor
france
he
spoke
with
tragedy
in
his
eyes
and
voice
seeing
the
vision
of
all
that
youth
of
france
which
even
then
in
march
of
had
been
offered
up
in
vast
sacrifice
to
the
greedy
devils
of
war
rain
was
slashing
down
now
beating
a
tattoo
on
the
steel
helmets
of
a
body
of
french
soldiers
who
stood
shivering
by
the
ruined
walls
while
were
making
a
tumult
in
the
neighborhood
they
were
the
men
of
henri
barbusse
his
comrades
there
were
men
and
boys
mixed
together
in
a
confraternity
of
misery
they
were
plastered
with
wet
clay
and
their
boots
were
enlarged
grotesquely
by
the
clots
of
mud
on
them
their
blue
coats
were
soddened
and
the
water
dripped
out
of
them
and
made
pools
round
their
feet
they
were
unshaven
and
their
wet
faces
were
smeared
with
the
soil
of
the
trenches
how
goes
it
said
the
french
captain
with
me
it
does
not
go
said
the
french
sergeant
nom
de
dieu
my
men
are
not
gay
they
have
been
wet
for
three
weeks
and
their
bones
are
aching
this
place
is
not
a
bal
tabourin
if
we
light
even
a
little
fire
we
ask
for
trouble
at
the
sight
of
smoke
the
dirty
boche
starts
shelling
again
so
we
do
not
get
dry
and
we
have
no
warmth
and
we
can
not
make
even
a
cup
of
good
hot
coffee
that
dirty
boche
up
there
on
vimy
looks
out
of
his
deep
tunnels
and
laughs
up
his
sleeve
and
says
those
poor
devils
of
frenchmen
are
not
gay
that
is
true
mon
capitaine
mais
que
pour
la
oui
pour
la
the
french
captain
turned
away
and
i
could
see
that
he
pitied
those
comrades
of
his
as
we
went
over
cratered
earth
to
the
village
of
neuville
poor
fellows
he
said
presently
not
even
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
that
is
war
blood
and
misery
glory
yes
afterward
but
at
what
a
price
so
we
came
to
neuville
a
large
village
once
with
a
fine
church
old
in
history
a
schoolhouse
a
town
hall
many
little
streets
of
comfortable
houses
under
the
shelter
of
the
friendly
old
hill
of
vimy
and
within
easy
walk
of
arras
then
a
frightful
rubbish
heap
mingled
with
unexploded
shells
the
twisted
iron
of
perambulators
bits
of
dead
bodies
and
shattered
two
french
soldiers
carried
a
stretcher
on
which
a
heavy
burden
lay
under
a
blanket
it
is
a
bad
wound
asked
the
captain
the
men
laid
the
stretcher
down
breathing
hard
and
uncovered
a
face
waxen
the
color
of
death
it
was
the
face
of
a
handsome
man
with
a
pointed
beard
breathing
snuffily
through
his
nose
he
may
live
as
far
as
the
dressing
station
said
one
of
the
frenchmen
it
was
a
which
blew
a
hole
in
his
body
just
now
over
the
man
jerked
his
head
toward
a
barricade
of
sand
bags
at
the
end
of
a
street
of
ruin
two
other
men
walked
slowly
toward
us
with
a
queer
hobbling
gait
both
of
them
were
wounded
in
the
legs
and
had
tied
rags
round
their
wounds
tightly
they
looked
grave
almost
sullen
staring
at
us
as
they
passed
with
brooding
eyes
the
german
are
very
evil
said
the
captain
we
poked
about
the
ruins
raising
our
heads
cautiously
above
to
look
at
the
german
lines
cut
into
the
lower
slopes
of
vimy
and
thrust
out
by
communication
trenches
to
the
edge
of
the
village
in
which
we
walked
a
boy
officer
came
up
out
of
a
hole
and
saluted
the
captain
who
stepped
back
and
said
in
an
emotional
way
tiens
toi
edouard
oui
mon
the
boy
had
a
fine
delicate
latin
face
with
dark
eyes
and
long
black
eyelashes
you
are
a
lieutenant
then
how
does
it
go
edouard
it
does
not
go
answered
the
boy
like
that
french
sergeant
in
ablain
this
is
a
bad
place
i
lose
my
men
every
day
there
were
three
killed
yesterday
and
six
wounded
already
there
are
two
killed
and
ten
something
broke
in
his
voice
ce
pas
bon
du
tout
du
tout
it
is
not
good
at
all
at
all
the
captain
clapped
him
on
the
shoulders
tried
to
cheer
him
courage
mon
vieux
the
rain
shot
down
on
us
our
feet
slithered
in
deep
greasy
mud
sharp
stabs
of
flame
vomited
out
of
the
slopes
of
vimy
there
was
the
high
scream
of
shells
in
flight
to
notre
dame
de
lorette
batteries
of
were
firing
rapidly
and
their
shells
cut
through
the
air
above
us
like
scythes
the
caldron
in
this
pit
of
war
was
being
stirred
up
another
wounded
poilu
was
carried
past
us
covered
by
a
bloody
blanket
like
the
other
one
from
slimy
and
wet
ruins
came
the
sickening
stench
of
human
corruption
a
boot
with
some
pulp
inside
protruded
from
a
mud
bank
where
i
stood
and
there
was
a
human
head
without
eyes
or
nose
black
and
rotting
in
the
puddle
of
a
shell
hole
those
were
relics
of
a
battle
on
may
a
year
before
when
swarms
of
boys
of
the
class
boys
of
eighteen
the
flower
of
french
youth
rushed
forward
from
the
crossroads
at
la
targette
a
few
hundred
yards
away
to
capture
these
ruins
of
neuville
they
captured
them
and
it
cost
them
seven
thousand
in
killed
and
wounded
at
least
three
thousand
dead
they
fought
like
young
demons
through
the
flaming
streets
they
fell
in
heaps
under
the
german
machine
guns
cut
them
down
as
though
they
were
ripe
corn
under
the
sickle
but
these
french
boys
broke
the
prussian
guard
that
day
round
about
over
all
this
ground
below
notre
dame
de
lorette
and
the
fields
round
souchez
the
french
had
fought
ferociously
burrowing
below
earth
at
the
labyrinth
sapping
mining
gaining
a
network
of
trenches
an
isolated
house
a
huddle
of
ruins
a
german
by
frequent
rushes
and
the
frenzy
of
those
who
fight
vith
their
teeth
and
hands
flinging
themselves
on
the
bodies
of
their
enemy
below
ground
in
the
darkness
or
above
ground
between
ditches
and
so
for
something
like
fifteen
months
they
fought
by
souchez
and
the
labyrinth
until
in
february
of
they
went
away
after
greeting
our
khaki
men
who
came
into
their
old
places
and
found
the
bones
and
bodies
of
frenchmen
there
as
i
found
white
bones
in
disused
trenches
below
notre
dame
when
the
rain
washed
the
earth
down
and
uncovered
them
xiv
it
was
then
in
that
february
of
that
the
city
of
arras
passed
for
defense
into
british
hands
and
became
from
that
time
on
one
of
our
strongholds
on
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
so
that
it
will
be
haunted
forever
by
the
ghosts
of
those
men
of
ours
whom
i
saw
there
on
many
days
of
grim
fighting
month
after
month
in
snow
and
sun
and
rain
in
steel
helmets
and
in
muddy
khaki
and
kilts
in
queues
of
wounded
three
thousand
at
a
time
outside
the
citadel
in
billets
where
their
laughter
and
music
were
scornful
of
high
velocities
in
the
surging
tide
of
traffic
that
poured
through
to
victory
that
cost
as
much
sometimes
as
defeat
when
i
first
went
into
arras
during
its
occupation
by
the
french
i
remembered
a
day
fifteen
months
before
near
the
town
of
in
artois
where
i
was
caught
up
in
one
of
those
tides
of
fugitives
which
in
those
early
days
of
war
used
to
roll
back
in
a
state
of
terror
before
the
german
invasion
where
do
they
come
from
i
asked
watching
this
long
procession
of
gigs
and
farmers
carts
and
tramping
women
and
children
the
answer
told
me
everything
they
are
bombarding
arras
since
then
they
had
never
ceased
to
bombard
arras
from
many
points
of
view
as
i
had
come
through
the
countryside
at
night
i
had
seen
the
flashes
of
shells
over
that
city
and
had
thought
of
the
agony
inside
four
days
before
i
went
in
first
it
was
bombarded
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
shells
each
one
of
which
would
destroy
a
cathedral
it
was
with
a
sense
of
being
near
to
death
not
a
pleasant
feeling
you
understand
that
i
went
into
arras
for
the
first
time
and
saw
what
had
happened
to
it
i
was
very
near
to
the
germans
no
more
than
ten
yards
away
when
i
stood
peering
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
maison
rouge
in
the
suburb
of
blangy
it
was
a
villa
torn
by
shells
with
a
piano
in
the
parlor
which
no
man
dared
to
play
behind
a
shelter
of
and
no
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
from
the
lines
when
i
paced
up
and
down
the
great
railway
station
of
arras
where
no
trains
ever
traveled
for
more
than
a
year
the
enemy
had
been
encamped
outside
the
city
and
for
all
that
time
had
tried
to
batter
a
way
into
and
through
it
an
endless
battle
had
surged
up
against
its
walls
but
in
spite
of
all
their
desperate
attacks
no
german
soldier
had
set
foot
inside
the
city
except
as
a
prisoner
of
war
many
thousands
of
young
frenchmen
had
given
their
blood
to
save
it
the
enemy
had
not
been
able
to
prevail
over
flesh
and
blood
and
the
spirit
of
heroic
men
but
he
had
destroyed
the
city
bit
by
bit
it
was
pitiful
beyond
all
expression
it
was
worse
than
looking
upon
a
woman
whose
beauty
had
been
scarred
by
bloody
usage
for
arras
was
a
city
of
beauty
a
living
expression
in
stone
of
all
the
idealism
in
eight
hundred
years
of
history
a
most
sweet
and
gracious
place
even
then
after
a
year
bombardment
some
spiritual
exhalation
of
human
love
and
art
came
to
one
out
of
all
this
ruin
when
i
entered
the
city
and
wandered
a
little
in
its
public
gardens
before
going
into
its
dead
heart
the
grande
place
i
felt
the
strange
survival
the
trees
here
were
slashed
by
shrapnel
enormous
had
plowed
up
those
the
shrubberies
were
beaten
down
almost
every
house
had
been
hit
every
building
was
scarred
and
slashed
but
for
the
most
part
the
city
still
stood
so
that
i
went
through
many
long
streets
and
passed
long
lines
of
houses
all
deserted
all
dreadful
in
their
silence
and
desolation
and
ruin
then
i
came
to
the
cathedral
of
it
was
an
enormous
building
of
the
renaissance
not
beautiful
but
impressive
in
its
spaciousness
and
dignity
next
to
it
was
the
bishop
palace
with
long
corridors
and
halls
and
a
private
chapel
upon
these
walls
and
domes
the
fury
of
great
shells
had
spent
itself
pillars
as
wide
in
girth
as
giant
trees
had
been
snapped
off
to
the
base
the
dome
of
the
cathedral
opened
with
a
yawning
chasm
high
explosives
burst
through
the
walls
the
keystones
of
arches
were
blown
out
and
masses
of
masonry
were
piled
into
the
nave
and
aisles
as
i
stood
there
rooks
had
perched
in
the
broken
vaulting
and
flew
with
noisy
wings
above
the
ruined
altars
another
sound
came
like
a
great
beating
of
wings
with
a
swifter
rush
it
was
a
shell
and
the
vibration
of
it
stirred
the
crumbling
masonry
and
bits
of
it
fell
with
a
clatter
to
the
littered
floor
on
the
way
to
the
ruin
of
the
bishop
chapel
i
passed
a
group
of
stone
figures
they
were
the
famous
angels
of
arras
removed
from
some
other
part
of
the
building
to
what
might
have
been
a
safer
place
now
they
were
fallen
angels
mangled
as
they
lay
but
in
the
chapel
beyond
where
the
light
streamed
through
the
broken
panes
of
windows
one
figure
stood
untouched
in
all
this
ruin
it
was
a
tall
statue
of
christ
standing
in
an
attitude
of
meekness
and
sorrow
as
though
in
the
presence
of
those
who
crucified
him
yet
something
more
wonderful
than
this
scene
of
tragedy
lived
in
the
midst
of
it
yet
there
were
still
people
living
in
arras
they
lived
an
underground
life
for
the
most
part
coming
up
from
the
underworld
to
blink
in
the
sunlight
to
mutter
a
prayer
or
a
curse
or
two
to
gaze
for
a
moment
at
any
change
made
by
a
new
day
bombardment
and
then
to
burrow
down
again
at
the
shock
of
a
gun
through
low
archways
just
above
the
pavement
i
looked
down
into
some
of
the
cellars
where
the
merchants
used
to
stock
their
wine
and
saw
old
women
and
sometimes
young
women
there
cooking
over
little
stoves
pottering
about
iron
bedsteads
busy
with
domestic
work
some
of
them
looked
up
as
i
passed
and
my
eyes
and
theirs
stared
into
each
other
the
women
faces
were
lined
and
their
eyes
sunken
they
had
the
look
of
people
who
have
lived
through
many
agonies
and
have
more
to
suffer
not
all
these
citizens
of
arras
were
below
ground
there
was
a
greengrocer
shop
still
carrying
on
a
little
trade
i
went
into
another
shop
and
bought
some
picture
of
the
ruins
within
a
few
yards
of
it
the
woman
behind
the
counter
was
a
comely
soul
and
laughed
because
she
had
no
change
only
two
days
before
a
shell
had
burst
fifty
yards
or
so
away
from
her
shop
which
was
close
enough
for
death
i
marveled
at
the
risk
she
took
with
cheerful
smiles
was
it
courage
or
stupidity
one
of
the
old
women
in
the
street
grasped
my
arm
in
a
friendly
way
and
called
me
cher
petit
ami
and
described
how
she
had
been
nearly
killed
a
hundred
times
when
i
asked
her
why
she
stayed
she
gave
an
old
cackling
laugh
and
said
que
jeune
homme
which
did
not
seem
a
satisfactory
answer
as
dusk
crept
into
the
streets
of
arras
i
saw
small
groups
of
boys
and
girls
they
seemed
to
come
out
of
holes
in
the
ground
to
stare
at
this
englishman
in
khaki
are
you
afraid
of
the
shells
i
asked
they
grimaced
up
at
the
sky
and
giggled
they
had
got
used
to
the
hell
of
it
all
and
dodged
death
as
they
would
a
man
with
a
whip
shouting
with
laughter
beyond
the
length
of
his
lash
in
one
of
the
vaulted
cellars
underground
when
english
soldiers
first
went
in
there
lived
a
group
of
girls
who
gave
them
wine
to
drink
and
kisses
for
a
franc
or
two
and
the
circe
cup
of
pleasure
if
they
had
time
to
stay
overhead
shells
were
howling
their
city
was
stricken
with
death
these
women
lived
like
witches
in
a
cave
a
strange
and
dreadful
life
i
walked
to
the
suburb
of
blangy
by
way
of
and
came
to
a
sinister
place
along
the
highroad
from
arras
to
douai
was
a
great
factory
of
some
kind
probably
for
beet
sugar
and
then
a
street
of
small
houses
with
back
yards
and
gardens
much
like
those
in
our
own
suburbs
holes
had
been
knocked
through
the
walls
of
the
factory
and
houses
the
gardens
had
been
barricaded
with
barbed
wire
and
and
the
passage
from
house
to
house
and
between
the
overturned
boilers
of
the
factory
formed
a
communication
trench
to
the
advanced
outpost
in
the
last
house
held
by
the
french
on
the
other
side
of
which
is
the
enemy
as
we
made
our
way
through
these
ruined
houses
we
had
to
walk
very
quietly
and
to
speak
in
whispers
in
the
last
house
of
all
which
was
a
combination
of
fort
and
dugout
absolute
silence
was
necessary
for
there
were
german
soldiers
only
ten
yards
away
with
and
bombs
and
rifles
always
ready
to
snipe
across
the
walls
through
a
chink
no
wider
than
my
finger
i
could
see
the
ruins
of
the
houses
inhabited
by
the
enemy
and
the
road
to
douai
the
road
to
douai
as
seen
through
this
chink
was
a
tangle
of
broken
bricks
the
enemy
was
so
close
to
arras
when
the
french
held
it
that
there
were
many
places
where
one
had
to
step
quietly
and
duck
one
head
or
get
behind
the
shelter
of
a
broken
wall
to
avoid
a
sniper
bullet
or
the
rattle
of
bullets
from
a
as
i
left
arras
in
that
november
evening
darkness
closed
in
its
ruined
streets
and
shells
were
crashing
over
the
city
from
french
guns
answered
now
and
then
by
enemy
batteries
but
in
a
moment
of
rare
silence
i
heard
the
chime
of
a
church
clock
it
seemed
like
the
sweet
voice
of
that
peace
in
arras
before
the
days
of
its
agony
and
i
thought
of
that
solitary
bell
sounding
above
the
ruins
in
a
ghostly
way
xv
while
we
hung
on
the
news
from
verdun
it
seemed
as
though
the
fate
of
the
world
were
in
fort
douaumont
our
own
lists
of
death
grew
longer
in
the
casualty
clearing
station
by
poperinghe
more
mangled
men
lay
on
their
stretchers
hobbled
to
the
groped
blindly
with
one
hand
clutching
at
a
comrade
arm
more
and
more
and
more
with
head
wounds
and
body
wounds
with
and
gas
o
christ
said
one
of
them
whom
i
knew
he
had
been
laid
on
a
in
the
now
you
will
be
comfortable
and
happy
said
the
orderly
the
boy
groaned
again
he
was
suffering
intolerable
agony
and
grasping
a
strap
hauled
himself
up
a
little
with
a
wet
sweat
breaking
out
on
his
forehead
another
boy
came
along
alone
with
one
hand
in
a
big
bandage
he
told
me
that
it
was
smashed
to
bits
and
began
to
cry
then
he
smudged
the
tears
away
and
said
i
lucky
enough
i
saw
many
fellows
so
it
happened
day
by
day
but
the
courage
of
our
men
endured
it
seemed
impossible
to
newcomers
that
life
could
exist
at
all
under
the
which
the
germans
flung
over
our
trenches
and
which
we
flung
over
theirs
so
it
seemed
to
the
irish
battalions
when
they
held
the
lines
round
loos
by
that
hohenzollern
redoubt
which
was
one
of
our
little
hells
things
happened
said
one
of
them
which
in
other
times
would
have
been
called
miracles
we
all
had
hairbreadth
escapes
from
for
days
they
were
under
heavy
fire
with
flinging
up
volumes
of
sand
and
earth
and
stones
about
them
then
waves
of
then
and
bombs
it
seemed
like
years
said
one
of
the
irish
crowd
none
of
us
expected
to
come
out
yet
most
of
them
had
the
luck
to
come
out
alive
that
time
and
over
a
midday
mess
in
a
flemish
farmhouse
they
had
hearty
appetites
for
bully
beef
and
fried
potatoes
washed
down
by
thin
red
wine
and
strong
black
coffee
round
ypres
and
up
by
boesinghe
and
hooge
you
remember
hooge
the
and
divisions
took
turns
in
wet
ditches
and
in
with
heavy
crumps
falling
fast
and
roaring
before
they
burst
like
devils
of
hell
on
one
day
there
were
three
hundred
casualties
in
one
battalion
the
german
lengthened
and
men
were
killed
on
their
way
out
to
rest
camps
to
the
left
of
the
road
between
poperinghe
and
vlamertinghe
on
march
the
royal
fusiliers
and
the
northumberland
fusiliers
the
old
fighting
fifth
captured
six
hundred
yards
of
german
trenches
near
and
asked
for
trouble
which
sure
enough
came
to
them
who
followed
them
their
attack
was
against
a
german
stronghold
built
of
earth
and
nine
feet
high
above
a
nest
of
trenches
in
the
fork
of
two
roads
from
to
messines
they
mined
beneath
this
place
and
it
blew
up
with
a
roaring
blast
which
flung
up
tons
of
soil
in
a
black
mass
then
the
fusiliers
dashed
forward
flinging
bombs
through
barbed
wire
and
over
which
had
escaped
the
radius
of
the
in
one
jumbled
mass
of
human
bodies
in
a
hurry
to
get
on
to
kill
and
to
come
back
one
german
got
to
work
on
them
it
was
knocked
out
by
a
bomb
flung
by
an
officer
who
saved
his
company
the
machine
gunners
were
bayoneted
elsewhere
there
was
chaos
out
of
which
living
men
came
shaking
and
moaning
i
saw
the
royal
fusiliers
and
northumberland
fusiliers
come
back
from
this
exploit
exhausted
caked
from
head
to
foot
in
wet
clay
their
steel
helmets
were
covered
with
their
their
rifles
and
smoke
helmets
were
all
plastered
by
wet
white
earth
and
they
looked
a
ragged
regiment
of
scarecrows
gathered
from
the
fields
of
france
some
of
them
had
shawls
tied
about
their
helmets
and
some
of
them
wore
the
shiny
black
helmets
of
the
jaeger
regiment
and
the
gray
coats
of
german
soldiers
they
had
had
luck
they
had
not
left
many
comrades
behind
and
they
had
come
out
with
life
to
the
good
world
tired
as
they
were
they
came
along
as
though
to
carnival
they
had
proved
their
courage
through
an
ugly
job
they
had
done
damn
well
as
one
of
them
remarked
and
they
were
out
of
the
which
ravaged
the
ground
they
had
taken
where
other
men
lay
xvi
at
the
beginning
of
march
there
was
a
little
affair
costing
a
lot
of
lives
in
the
neighborhood
of
up
in
the
ypres
salient
it
was
a
struggle
for
a
dirty
hillock
called
the
bluff
which
had
been
held
for
a
long
time
by
the
division
under
general
haldane
whose
men
were
at
last
relieved
after
weary
months
in
the
salient
by
the
division
commanded
by
general
pilcher
the
germans
took
advantage
of
the
change
in
defense
by
a
sudden
attack
after
the
explosion
of
a
mine
and
the
men
of
the
division
new
to
this
ground
abandoned
a
position
of
some
local
importance
general
haldane
was
annoyed
it
was
ground
of
which
he
knew
every
inch
it
was
ground
which
men
of
his
had
died
to
hold
it
was
very
annoying
using
a
feeble
word
to
battalion
officers
and
men
of
the
division
suffolks
and
king
own
liverpools
gordons
and
royal
scots
who
had
first
come
out
of
the
salient
out
of
its
mud
and
snow
and
slush
and
to
a
pretty
village
far
behind
the
lines
on
the
road
to
calais
where
they
were
getting
back
to
a
sense
of
normal
life
again
sleeping
in
snug
billets
warming
their
feet
at
wood
fires
listening
with
enchantment
to
the
silence
about
them
free
from
the
noise
of
artillery
they
were
hugging
themselves
with
the
thought
of
a
month
of
this
then
because
they
had
been
in
the
salient
so
long
and
had
held
this
line
so
stubbornly
they
were
ordered
back
again
to
recapture
the
position
lost
by
new
men
after
a
day
of
field
sports
they
were
having
a
boxing
match
in
an
old
barn
very
merry
and
bright
before
that
news
came
to
them
general
haldane
had
given
me
a
quiet
word
about
it
and
i
watched
the
boxing
and
the
faces
of
all
those
men
crowded
round
the
ring
with
pity
for
the
frightful
disappointment
that
was
about
to
fall
on
them
like
a
i
knew
some
of
their
officers
colonel
dyson
of
the
royal
scots
and
captain
heathcote
who
hated
the
war
and
all
its
ways
with
a
deadly
hatred
having
seen
much
slaughter
of
men
and
of
their
own
officers
colonel
dyson
was
the
seventeenth
commanding
officer
of
his
battalion
which
had
been
commanded
by
every
officer
down
to
second
lieutenant
and
had
only
thirty
men
left
of
the
original
crowd
they
had
been
slain
in
large
numbers
in
that
holding
attack
by
hooge
on
september
during
the
battle
of
loos
as
i
have
told
now
they
were
going
in
again
and
were
very
sorry
for
themselves
but
hid
their
feelings
from
their
men
the
men
were
tough
and
stalwart
lads
tanned
by
the
wind
and
rain
of
a
foul
winter
thinned
down
by
the
ordeal
of
those
months
in
the
line
under
daily
bouts
of
fire
in
a
wooden
gallery
of
the
barn
a
mass
of
them
lay
in
deep
straw
exchanging
caps
whistling
shouting
in
high
spirits
not
yet
did
they
know
the
to
the
salient
then
word
was
passed
to
them
after
the
boxing
finals
that
night
they
had
to
march
seven
miles
to
entrain
for
the
railroad
nearest
to
ypres
i
saw
them
march
away
silently
grimly
bravely
without
many
curses
they
were
to
recapture
the
bluff
and
early
on
the
morning
of
march
before
dawn
had
risen
i
went
out
to
the
salient
and
watched
the
bombardment
which
preceded
the
attack
there
was
an
incessant
tumult
of
guns
and
the
noise
rolled
in
waves
across
the
flat
country
of
the
salient
and
echoed
back
from
kemmel
hill
and
the
wytschaete
ridge
there
was
a
white
frost
over
the
fields
and
all
the
was
veiled
by
a
mist
which
clung
round
the
villages
and
farmsteads
behind
the
lines
and
made
a
dense
bank
of
gray
fog
below
the
rising
ground
this
curtain
was
rent
with
flashes
of
light
and
little
glinting
stars
burst
continually
over
one
spot
where
the
bluff
was
hidden
beyond
zillebeke
lake
when
daybreak
came
with
the
rim
of
a
red
sun
over
a
clump
of
trees
in
the
east
the
noise
of
guns
increased
in
spasms
of
intensity
like
a
rising
storm
many
batteries
of
heavy
artillery
were
firing
salvos
widely
scattered
concentrated
their
fire
upon
one
area
where
their
shells
were
bursting
with
a
twinkle
of
light
somewhere
a
was
at
work
with
sharp
staccato
strokes
like
an
urgent
knocking
at
the
door
high
overhead
was
the
song
of
an
airplane
coming
nearer
with
a
high
vibrant
humming
it
was
an
enemy
searching
through
the
mist
down
below
him
for
any
movement
of
troops
or
trains
it
was
the
brigade
of
the
division
which
attacked
at
four
that
morning
and
they
were
the
suffolks
gordons
and
own
liverpools
who
led
the
assault
commanded
by
general
pratt
they
flung
themselves
into
the
german
lines
in
the
wake
of
a
heavy
barrage
fire
smashing
through
broken
belts
of
wire
and
stumbling
in
and
out
of
the
germans
in
their
had
gone
to
cover
in
deep
dugouts
which
they
had
built
with
feverish
haste
on
the
bluff
and
its
neighborhood
during
the
previous
ten
days
and
nights
at
first
only
a
few
men
not
more
than
a
hundred
or
so
could
be
discovered
alive
the
dead
were
thick
in
the
maze
of
trenches
and
our
men
stumbled
across
them
the
living
were
in
a
worse
state
than
the
dead
dazed
by
the
and
cold
with
terror
when
our
men
sprang
upon
them
in
the
darkness
before
dawn
small
parties
were
collected
and
passed
back
as
prisoners
marvelously
lucky
men
if
they
kept
their
sanity
as
well
as
their
lives
after
all
that
hell
about
them
hours
later
when
our
battalions
had
stormed
their
way
up
other
trenches
into
a
salient
jutting
out
of
the
german
line
and
beyond
the
boundary
of
the
objective
that
had
been
given
to
them
other
living
men
were
found
to
be
still
hiding
in
the
depths
of
other
dugouts
and
could
not
be
induced
to
come
out
terror
kept
them
in
those
holes
and
they
were
like
wild
beasts
at
bay
still
dangerous
because
they
had
their
bombs
and
rifles
an
ultimatum
was
shouted
down
to
them
by
men
too
busy
for
persuasive
talk
if
you
do
come
out
you
be
blown
some
of
them
came
out
and
others
were
blown
to
bits
after
that
the
usual
thing
happened
the
thing
that
inevitably
happened
in
all
these
little
murderous
attacks
and
the
enemy
concentrated
all
its
power
of
artillery
on
that
position
captured
by
our
men
and
day
after
day
hurled
over
storms
of
shrapnel
and
high
explosives
under
which
our
men
cowered
until
many
were
killed
and
more
wounded
the
first
attack
on
the
bluff
and
its
recapture
cost
us
three
thousand
casualties
and
that
was
only
the
beginning
of
a
daily
toll
of
life
and
limbs
in
that
neighborhood
of
hell
through
driving
snowstorms
shells
went
rushing
across
that
battleground
ceaselessly
in
those
first
weeks
of
march
but
the
division
repulsed
the
enemy
repeated
attacks
in
bombing
fights
which
were
very
fierce
on
both
sides
i
went
to
general
pilcher
headquarters
at
reninghelst
on
march
and
found
the
staff
of
the
division
frosty
in
their
greeting
while
general
pratt
the
brigadier
of
the
division
was
conducting
the
attack
in
their
new
territory
general
pilcher
himself
was
much
shaken
the
old
gentleman
had
been
at
when
the
bombardment
had
begun
on
his
men
with
captain
rattnag
his
he
lay
for
an
hour
in
a
ditch
with
shells
screaming
overhead
and
bursting
close
more
than
once
when
i
talked
with
him
he
raised
his
head
and
listened
nervously
and
said
do
you
hear
the
guns
they
are
i
was
sorry
for
him
this
general
who
had
many
theories
on
war
and
experimented
in
as
when
one
night
i
stood
by
his
side
in
a
dark
field
and
had
a
courteous
dignity
and
gentleness
of
manner
he
was
a
fine
old
english
gentleman
and
a
gallant
soldier
but
modern
warfare
was
too
brutal
for
him
too
brutal
for
all
those
who
hated
its
slaughter
those
men
of
the
division
the
iron
division
as
it
was
called
later
in
the
war
remained
in
a
hideous
turmoil
of
wet
earth
up
by
the
bluff
until
other
men
came
to
relieve
them
and
take
over
this
corner
of
hell
what
remained
of
the
trenches
was
deep
in
water
and
filthy
mud
where
the
bodies
of
many
dead
germans
lay
under
a
litter
of
broken
and
in
the
holes
of
dugouts
nothing
could
be
done
to
make
it
less
horrible
then
the
weather
changed
and
became
icily
cold
with
snow
and
rain
one
dugout
which
had
been
taken
for
battalion
headquarters
was
six
feet
long
by
four
wide
and
here
in
this
waterlogged
hole
lived
three
officers
of
the
royal
scots
to
whom
a
day
or
two
before
i
had
wished
good
the
servants
lived
in
the
shaft
alongside
which
was
a
place
measuring
four
feet
by
four
feet
there
were
no
other
dugouts
where
men
could
get
any
shelter
from
shells
or
storms
and
the
enemy
guns
were
never
silent
but
the
men
held
on
as
most
of
our
men
held
on
with
a
resignation
to
fate
and
a
stoic
endurance
beyond
that
ordinary
human
courage
which
we
seemed
to
know
before
the
war
the
chaplain
of
this
battalion
had
spent
all
the
long
night
behind
the
lines
stoking
fires
and
going
round
the
and
looking
at
his
to
see
how
the
minutes
were
crawling
past
he
had
tea
rum
socks
oil
and
food
all
ready
for
those
who
were
coming
back
and
the
lighted
braziers
were
glowing
red
at
the
appointed
time
the
padre
went
out
to
meet
his
friends
pressing
forward
through
the
snow
and
listening
for
any
sound
of
footsteps
through
the
great
hush
but
there
was
no
sound
except
the
soft
flutter
of
snowflakes
he
strained
his
eyes
for
any
moving
shadows
of
men
but
there
was
only
darkness
and
the
falling
snow
two
hours
passed
and
they
seemed
endless
to
that
young
chaplain
whose
brain
was
full
of
frightful
apprehensions
so
that
they
were
hours
of
anguish
to
him
then
at
last
the
first
men
appeared
i
never
seen
anything
so
splendid
and
so
pitiful
said
the
man
who
had
been
waiting
for
them
they
came
along
at
about
a
mile
an
hour
sometimes
in
groups
sometimes
by
twos
or
threes
holding
on
to
each
other
often
one
by
one
in
this
order
they
crept
through
the
ruined
villages
in
the
falling
snow
which
lay
thick
upon
the
masses
of
fallen
masonry
there
was
a
profound
silence
about
them
and
these
men
were
like
ghosts
walking
through
cities
of
death
no
man
spoke
for
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
would
have
seemed
a
danger
in
this
great
white
quietude
they
were
walking
like
old
men
and
bent
under
the
weight
of
their
packs
and
rifles
yet
when
the
young
padre
greeted
them
with
a
cheery
voice
that
hid
the
water
in
his
heart
every
one
had
a
word
and
a
smile
in
reply
and
made
little
jests
about
their
drunken
footsteps
for
they
were
like
drunken
men
with
utter
weariness
what
price
charlie
chaplin
now
sir
was
one
man
joke
the
last
of
those
who
came
back
and
there
were
many
who
never
came
back
were
some
hours
later
than
the
first
company
having
found
it
hard
to
crawl
along
that
via
dolorosa
which
led
to
the
good
place
where
the
braziers
were
glowing
it
was
a
heroic
episode
for
each
one
of
these
men
was
a
hero
though
his
name
will
never
be
known
in
the
history
of
that
silent
and
hidden
war
and
yet
it
was
an
ordinary
episode
no
degree
worse
in
its
hardship
than
what
happened
all
along
the
line
when
there
was
an
attack
or
in
foul
weather
the
marvel
of
it
was
that
our
men
who
were
very
simple
men
should
have
stuck
it
out
with
that
grandeur
of
courage
which
endured
all
things
without
and
without
emotion
they
were
unconscious
of
the
virtue
that
was
in
them
xvii
going
up
to
the
line
by
ypres
or
armentieres
or
loos
i
noticed
in
those
early
months
of
an
increasing
power
of
artillery
on
our
side
of
the
lines
and
a
growing
intensity
of
on
both
sides
time
was
a
year
before
when
our
batteries
were
scattered
thinly
behind
the
lines
and
when
our
gunners
had
to
be
thrifty
of
shells
saving
them
up
anxiously
for
hours
of
great
need
when
the
s
o
s
rocket
shot
up
a
green
light
from
some
battered
trench
upon
which
the
enemy
was
concentrating
those
were
ghastly
days
for
gunner
officers
who
had
to
answer
telephone
messages
calling
for
help
from
battalions
whose
billets
were
being
shelled
to
pieces
by
long
range
howitzers
or
from
engineers
whose
were
being
sniped
to
death
by
german
or
from
a
brigadier
who
wanted
to
know
plaintively
whether
the
artillery
could
not
deal
with
a
certain
gun
which
was
enfilading
a
certain
trench
and
piling
up
the
casualties
it
was
hard
to
say
sorry
we
got
to
go
slow
with
that
now
was
ancient
history
for
some
time
the
fields
had
grown
a
new
crop
of
british
batteries
month
after
month
our
weight
of
metal
increased
and
while
the
had
been
multiplying
at
a
great
rate
the
heavies
had
been
coming
out
too
and
giving
a
deeper
and
more
sonorous
tone
to
that
swelling
chorus
which
rolled
over
the
battlefields
by
day
and
night
there
was
a
larger
supply
of
shells
for
all
those
pieces
and
no
longer
the
same
need
for
thrift
when
there
was
urgent
need
for
artillery
support
retaliation
was
the
order
of
the
day
and
if
the
enemy
asked
for
trouble
by
any
special
show
of
hate
he
got
it
quickly
and
with
a
double
dose
compared
with
the
infantry
the
gunners
had
a
chance
of
life
except
in
places
where
as
in
the
salient
the
german
observers
stared
down
at
them
from
high
ground
and
saw
every
gun
flash
and
registered
every
battery
going
round
the
salient
one
day
with
general
burstall
and
a
very
good
name
too
who
was
then
the
canadian
i
was
horrified
at
the
way
in
which
the
enemy
had
the
accurate
range
of
our
guns
and
and
knocked
them
out
with
deadly
shooting
here
and
there
our
amateur
gunners
quick
to
learn
their
job
found
a
good
place
and
were
able
to
camouflage
their
position
for
a
time
and
give
praise
to
the
little
god
of
luck
until
one
day
sooner
or
later
they
were
discovered
and
a
quick
move
was
necessary
if
they
were
not
caught
too
soon
so
it
was
with
a
battery
in
the
open
fields
beyond
kemmel
village
where
i
went
to
see
a
boy
who
had
once
been
a
rising
hope
of
fleet
street
he
was
new
to
his
work
and
liked
the
adventure
of
it
that
was
before
his
men
were
blown
to
bits
around
him
and
he
was
sent
down
as
a
tragic
case
of
and
as
we
walked
through
the
village
of
kemmel
he
chatted
cheerfully
about
his
work
and
life
and
found
it
topping
his
bright
luminous
eyes
were
undimmed
by
the
scene
around
him
he
walked
in
a
jaunty
boyish
way
through
that
ruined
place
it
was
not
a
pleasant
place
kemmel
village
even
in
those
days
had
been
blown
to
bits
except
where
on
the
outskirts
the
chateau
with
its
remained
untouched
german
spies
said
the
boy
and
where
a
little
grotto
to
our
lady
of
lourdes
was
also
unscathed
the
church
was
battered
and
broken
and
there
were
enormous
in
the
churchyard
and
open
vaults
where
old
dead
had
been
tumbled
out
of
their
tombs
we
walked
along
a
sunken
road
and
then
to
a
barn
in
open
fields
the
roof
was
pierced
by
shrapnel
bullets
which
let
in
the
rain
on
wet
days
and
nights
but
it
was
cozy
otherwise
in
the
room
above
the
ladder
where
the
officers
had
their
mess
there
were
some
chairs
up
there
and
kirchner
prints
of
naked
little
ladies
were
tacked
up
to
the
beams
among
the
trench
maps
and
round
the
fireplace
where
logs
were
burning
was
a
canvas
screen
to
let
down
at
night
a
gramophone
played
merry
music
and
gave
a
homelike
touch
to
this
parlor
in
war
a
good
spot
i
said
is
it
well
hidden
as
safe
as
houses
said
the
captain
of
the
battery
touching
wood
i
there
were
six
of
us
sitting
at
a
wooden
plank
on
trestles
and
at
those
words
five
young
men
rose
with
a
look
of
fright
on
their
faces
and
embraced
the
beam
supporting
the
roof
of
the
barn
what
happened
i
asked
not
having
heard
the
howl
of
a
shell
nothing
said
the
boy
except
touching
wood
the
captain
spoke
too
we
went
out
to
the
guns
which
were
to
do
a
little
shooting
and
found
them
camouflaged
from
aerial
eyes
in
the
grim
desolation
of
the
battlefield
all
white
after
a
morning
snowstorm
except
where
the
broken
walls
of
distant
farmhouses
and
the
windmills
on
kemmel
hill
showed
black
as
ink
the
gunners
could
not
see
their
target
which
had
been
given
to
them
through
the
telephone
but
they
knew
it
by
the
figures
giving
the
angle
of
fire
it
a
in
a
waterlogged
trench
said
a
boy
by
my
side
he
was
one
of
the
rising
hopes
of
fleet
street
before
he
became
a
gunner
officer
in
flanders
with
any
luck
we
shall
get
in
the
neck
and
i
like
to
hear
the
germans
squeal
and
my
gun
ready
first
as
the
officer
commanding
shouted
through
a
tin
megaphone
and
the
battery
fired
each
gun
following
its
brother
at
a
second
interval
with
the
staccato
shock
of
a
which
is
more
painful
than
the
dull
roar
of
a
a
word
came
along
the
wire
from
the
officer
in
the
observation
post
a
mile
away
another
order
was
called
through
the
tin
mouthpiece
repeat
we
said
the
young
gentleman
by
my
side
in
a
cheerful
way
the
officer
with
the
megaphone
looked
across
and
smiled
we
may
as
well
give
them
a
salvo
they
wo
like
it
a
a
second
or
two
later
there
was
a
tremendous
crash
as
the
four
guns
fired
together
repeat
came
the
high
voice
through
the
megaphone
the
still
air
was
rent
again
in
a
waterlogged
trench
which
we
could
not
see
a
german
had
been
blown
to
bits
the
artillery
officers
took
turns
in
the
observation
posts
sleeping
for
the
night
in
one
of
the
dugouts
behind
the
front
trench
instead
of
in
the
billet
below
the
way
to
the
observation
post
was
sometimes
a
little
vague
especially
in
weather
when
parts
of
the
communication
trenches
slithered
down
under
the
weight
of
the
young
officer
who
walked
with
luminous
eyes
and
eager
step
found
it
necessary
to
crawl
on
his
stomach
before
he
reached
his
lookout
station
from
which
he
looked
straight
across
the
enemy
trenches
but
once
there
it
was
pretty
comfortable
and
safe
barring
a
direct
hit
from
above
or
a
little
mining
operation
underneath
he
made
a
seat
of
a
it
was
rather
a
shock
when
he
turned
it
over
one
day
to
get
dry
side
up
and
found
a
dead
frenchman
there
and
smoked
belgian
cigars
for
the
sake
of
their
aroma
and
sat
there
very
solitary
and
watchful
the
rats
worried
him
a
little
they
were
bold
enough
to
bare
their
teeth
when
they
met
him
down
a
trench
and
there
was
one
big
fellow
called
cuthbert
who
romped
round
his
dugout
and
actually
bit
his
ear
one
night
but
these
inconveniences
did
not
seem
to
give
any
real
distress
to
the
soul
of
youth
out
there
alone
and
searching
for
human
targets
to
kill
until
one
day
as
i
have
said
everything
snapped
in
him
and
the
boy
was
broken
it
was
on
the
way
back
from
kemmel
village
one
day
that
i
met
a
queer
apparition
through
a
heavy
snowstorm
it
was
a
french
civilian
in
evening
dress
boiled
shirt
white
tie
and
all
with
a
bowler
hat
bent
to
the
storm
tomlinson
the
great
tomlinson
was
with
me
and
shook
his
head
it
is
true
he
said
i
do
believe
it
we
mad
all
the
whole
world
is
mad
so
why
should
we
be
sane
we
stared
after
the
man
who
went
into
the
ruin
of
kemmel
to
the
noise
of
in
evening
dress
without
an
overcoat
through
a
blizzard
of
snow
a
little
farther
down
the
road
we
passed
a
signboard
on
the
edge
of
a
cratered
field
new
words
had
been
painted
on
it
in
good
roman
letters
cimetiere
reserve
tomlinson
the
only
tomlinson
regarded
it
gravely
and
turned
to
me
with
a
world
of
meaning
in
his
eyes
then
he
tapped
his
forehead
and
laughed
mad
he
said
we
all
mad
xviii
in
that
winter
of
discontent
there
was
one
great
body
of
splendid
men
whose
spirits
had
sunk
to
zero
seeing
no
hope
ahead
of
them
in
that
warfare
of
trenches
and
barbed
wire
the
cavalry
believed
they
were
bunkered
forever
and
that
all
their
training
and
tradition
were
made
futile
by
the
digging
in
of
armies
now
and
again
when
the
infantry
was
hard
pressed
as
in
the
second
battle
of
ypres
and
the
battle
of
loos
they
were
called
on
to
leave
their
horses
behind
and
take
a
turn
in
the
trenches
and
then
they
came
back
again
less
some
of
their
comrades
into
dirty
billets
remote
from
the
to
exercise
their
horses
and
curse
the
war
before
they
went
into
the
line
in
february
of
i
went
to
see
some
of
those
cavalry
officers
to
wish
them
good
luck
and
saw
them
in
the
trenches
and
afterward
when
they
came
out
in
the
headquarters
of
a
squadron
of
royals
the
way
in
was
by
a
ladder
through
the
window
billeted
in
a
village
which
on
a
day
of
frost
looked
as
quaint
and
pretty
as
a
christmas
card
was
a
party
of
officers
typical
of
the
british
cavalry
as
a
whole
a
few
pictures
cut
out
of
la
vie
parisienne
were
tacked
on
to
the
walls
to
remind
them
of
the
arts
and
graces
of
an
older
mode
of
life
and
to
keep
them
human
by
the
sight
of
a
pretty
face
oh
to
see
a
pretty
girl
again
now
they
were
going
to
change
this
cottage
for
the
trenches
this
quiet
village
with
a
chiming
every
hour
for
the
tumult
in
the
this
absolute
safety
for
the
immediate
menace
of
death
they
knew
already
the
beastliness
of
life
in
trenches
they
had
no
illusions
about
but
they
were
glad
to
go
because
activity
was
better
than
inactivity
and
because
the
risk
would
give
them
back
their
pride
and
because
the
cavalry
should
fight
anyhow
and
somehow
even
if
a
charge
or
a
pursuit
were
denied
them
they
had
a
hot
time
in
the
trenches
the
enemy
artillery
was
active
and
the
list
of
casualties
began
to
tot
up
a
good
officer
and
a
fine
fellow
was
killed
almost
at
the
outset
and
men
were
horribly
wounded
but
all
those
troopers
showed
a
cool
courage
things
looked
bad
for
a
few
minutes
when
a
section
of
trenches
was
blown
in
isolating
one
platoon
from
another
a
made
his
way
back
from
the
damaged
section
and
a
young
officer
who
was
going
forward
to
find
out
the
extent
of
damage
met
him
on
the
way
can
i
get
through
asked
the
officer
i
got
through
was
the
answer
but
it
chancing
one
the
officer
chanced
his
luck
but
did
not
expect
to
come
back
alive
afterward
he
tried
to
analyze
his
feelings
for
my
benefit
i
had
no
sense
of
fear
he
said
but
a
sort
of
subconscious
knowledge
that
the
odds
were
against
me
if
i
went
on
and
yet
a
conscious
determination
to
go
on
at
all
costs
and
find
out
what
had
he
came
back
covered
with
blood
but
unwounded
in
spite
of
all
the
unpleasant
sights
in
a
crumpled
trench
he
had
the
heart
to
smile
when
in
the
middle
of
the
night
one
of
the
sergeants
approached
him
with
an
amiable
suggestion
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
time
sir
to
make
a
slight
attack
upon
the
enemy
there
was
something
in
those
words
a
slight
attack
which
is
irresistibly
comic
to
any
of
us
who
know
the
conditions
of
modern
trench
war
but
they
were
not
spoken
in
jest
so
the
cavalry
did
its
bit
again
though
not
as
cavalry
and
i
saw
some
of
them
when
they
came
back
and
they
were
glad
to
have
gone
through
that
bloody
business
so
that
no
man
might
fling
a
scornful
word
as
they
passed
with
their
horses
it
is
queer
said
my
friend
how
we
go
from
this
place
of
peace
to
the
battlefield
and
then
come
back
for
a
spell
before
going
up
again
it
is
like
passing
from
one
life
to
in
that
cavalry
mess
i
heard
queer
conversations
those
officers
belonged
to
the
old
families
of
england
the
old
caste
of
aristocracy
but
the
foul
outrage
of
the
war
the
outrage
against
all
ideals
of
civilization
had
made
them
think
some
of
them
for
the
first
time
about
the
structure
of
social
life
and
of
the
human
family
they
hated
germany
as
the
direct
cause
of
war
but
they
looked
deeper
than
that
and
saw
how
the
leaders
of
all
great
nations
in
europe
had
maintained
the
philosophy
of
forms
and
had
built
up
hatreds
and
fears
and
alliances
over
the
heads
of
the
peoples
whom
they
inflamed
with
passion
or
duped
with
lies
the
politicians
are
the
guilty
ones
said
one
cavalry
officer
i
am
all
for
revolution
after
this
bloody
massacre
i
would
hang
all
politicians
diplomats
and
statesmen
with
strict
i
for
the
people
said
another
the
poor
bloody
people
who
are
kept
in
ignorance
and
then
driven
into
the
shambles
when
their
rulers
desire
to
grab
some
new
part
of
the
earth
surface
or
to
get
their
armies
going
because
they
are
bored
with
what
price
christianity
asked
another
inevitably
what
have
the
churches
done
to
stop
war
or
preach
the
gospel
of
christ
the
bishop
of
london
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
all
those
conventional
patriotic
cannon
blessing
humbugs
god
they
make
me
tired
strange
words
to
hear
in
a
cavalry
mess
strange
turmoil
in
the
souls
of
men
they
were
the
same
words
i
had
heard
from
london
boys
in
ypres
spoken
just
as
crudely
but
many
young
gentlemen
who
spoke
those
words
have
already
forgotten
them
or
would
deny
them
xix
the
winter
of
passed
with
its
misery
and
spring
came
again
to
france
and
flanders
with
its
promise
of
life
fulfilled
in
the
beauty
of
wild
flowers
and
the
green
of
leaves
where
the
earth
was
not
made
barren
by
the
fire
of
war
and
all
trees
killed
for
men
there
was
no
promise
of
life
but
only
new
preparations
for
death
and
continued
killing
the
battle
of
verdun
was
still
going
on
and
france
had
saved
herself
from
a
mortal
blow
at
the
heart
by
a
desperate
heroic
resistance
which
cost
her
five
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
dead
and
wounded
on
the
british
front
there
were
still
no
great
battles
but
those
trench
raids
artillery
duels
mine
fighting
and
small
massacres
which
filled
the
casualty
clearing
stations
with
the
average
amount
of
human
wreckage
the
british
armies
were
being
held
in
leash
for
a
great
offensive
in
the
summer
new
divisions
were
learning
the
lessons
of
the
old
divisions
and
here
and
there
generals
were
doing
a
little
fancy
work
to
keep
things
merry
and
bright
so
it
was
when
some
mines
were
exploded
under
the
german
earthworks
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
vimy
ridge
where
the
enemy
had
already
blown
several
mines
and
taken
possession
of
their
craters
it
was
to
gain
those
craters
and
new
ones
to
be
made
by
our
mine
charges
that
the
brigade
of
the
division
a
body
of
lancashire
men
the
loyal
north
lancashires
and
the
royal
fusiliers
with
a
company
of
royal
engineers
and
some
welsh
pioneers
were
detailed
for
the
perilous
adventure
of
driving
in
the
mine
shafts
putting
tremendous
charges
of
high
explosives
in
the
sapheads
and
rushing
the
german
positions
it
was
on
the
evening
of
may
after
two
days
of
wet
and
cloudy
weather
preventing
the
enemy
observation
that
our
heavy
artillery
fired
a
short
number
of
rounds
to
send
the
germans
into
their
dugouts
a
few
minutes
later
the
right
group
of
mines
exploded
with
a
terrific
roar
and
blew
in
two
of
the
five
old
german
craters
after
the
long
rumble
of
heaving
earth
had
been
stilled
there
was
just
time
enough
to
hear
the
staccato
of
a
german
then
there
was
a
second
roar
and
a
wild
upheaval
of
soil
when
the
left
group
of
mines
destroyed
two
more
of
the
german
craters
and
knocked
out
the
the
moment
for
the
infantry
attack
had
come
and
the
men
were
ready
the
first
to
get
away
were
two
lieutenants
of
the
loyal
north
lancashires
who
rushed
forward
with
their
to
the
remaining
crater
on
the
extreme
left
which
had
not
been
blown
up
with
little
opposition
from
dazed
and
germans
bayoneted
as
they
scrambled
out
of
the
chaotic
earth
our
men
flung
themselves
into
those
smoking
pits
and
were
followed
immediately
by
who
built
up
bombing
posts
with
earth
and
on
the
crater
lip
and
began
to
dig
out
communication
trenches
leading
to
them
the
of
the
lancashire
fusiliers
were
away
at
the
first
signal
and
were
attacking
the
other
groups
of
craters
under
heavy
fire
the
germans
were
shaken
with
terror
because
the
explosion
of
the
mines
had
killed
and
wounded
a
large
number
of
them
and
through
the
darkness
there
rang
out
the
cheers
of
masses
of
men
who
were
out
for
blood
through
the
darkness
there
now
glowed
a
scarlet
light
flooding
all
that
turmoil
of
earth
and
men
with
a
vivid
red
illumination
as
flare
after
flare
rose
high
into
the
sky
from
several
points
of
the
german
line
later
the
red
lights
died
down
and
then
other
rockets
were
fired
giving
a
green
light
to
this
scene
of
war
the
german
gunners
were
now
at
work
in
answer
to
those
beacons
of
distress
and
with
every
caliber
of
gun
from
howitzers
to
minenwerfers
they
shelled
our
for
two
hours
and
killed
for
vengeance
they
were
too
late
to
stop
the
advance
of
the
assaulting
troops
who
were
fighting
in
the
craters
against
groups
of
german
bombers
who
tried
to
force
their
way
up
to
the
rescue
of
a
position
already
lost
one
of
our
officers
leading
the
assault
on
one
of
the
craters
on
the
right
was
killed
very
quickly
but
his
men
were
not
checked
and
with
individual
resolution
and
initiative
and
the
grit
of
the
lancashire
man
in
a
tight
place
fought
on
grimly
and
won
their
purpose
a
young
lieutenant
fell
dead
from
a
bullet
wound
after
he
had
directed
his
men
to
their
posts
from
the
lip
of
a
new
as
coolly
as
though
he
were
a
master
of
ceremonies
in
a
lancashire
ballroom
another
a
champion
with
a
range
of
forty
yards
flung
his
at
the
enemy
with
untiring
skill
and
with
a
fierce
contempt
of
death
until
he
was
killed
by
an
answering
shot
the
took
up
the
command
and
the
men
carried
on
until
they
held
all
the
chain
of
craters
crouching
and
panting
above
mangled
men
they
were
hours
of
anguish
for
many
germans
who
lay
wounded
and
half
buried
or
quite
buried
in
the
chaos
of
earth
made
by
those
now
doubly
upheaved
their
screams
and
moans
sounding
above
the
guns
the
frantic
cries
of
men
maddened
under
tons
of
earth
which
kept
them
prisoners
in
deep
pits
below
the
crater
lips
and
awful
inarticulate
noises
of
human
pain
coming
out
of
that
lower
darkness
beyond
the
light
of
the
rockets
made
up
a
chorus
of
agony
more
than
our
men
could
endure
even
in
the
heat
of
battle
they
shouted
across
to
the
german
grenadiers
we
will
cease
fire
if
you
will
and
let
you
get
in
your
wounded
cease
fire
for
the
wounded
the
shout
was
repeated
and
our
bombers
held
their
hands
still
waiting
for
an
answer
but
the
answer
was
a
new
storm
of
bombs
and
the
fighting
went
on
and
the
moaning
of
the
men
who
were
helpless
and
unhelped
followed
up
the
assault
to
consolidate
the
position
they
did
amazing
things
toiling
in
the
darkness
under
abominable
and
by
daylight
had
built
communication
trenches
with
from
the
crater
lips
to
our
trenches
but
now
it
was
the
enemy
turn
the
turn
of
his
guns
which
poured
explosive
fire
into
those
pits
churning
up
the
earth
again
mixing
it
with
new
flesh
and
blood
and
carving
up
his
own
dead
and
it
was
the
turn
of
his
bombers
who
followed
this
fire
in
strong
assaults
upon
the
lancashire
lads
who
lying
among
their
killed
and
wounded
had
to
repel
those
fierce
attacks
on
may
i
went
to
see
general
doran
of
the
division
an
optimistic
old
gentleman
who
took
a
bright
view
of
things
and
colonel
crosby
who
was
acting
brigadier
of
the
brigade
which
had
made
the
attack
he
too
was
enthusiastic
about
the
situation
though
his
brigade
had
suffered
eight
hundred
casualties
in
a
month
of
routine
warfare
in
my
simple
way
i
asked
him
a
direct
question
do
you
think
your
men
can
hold
on
to
the
craters
sir
colonel
crosby
stared
at
me
sternly
certainly
the
position
can
not
be
retaken
overground
we
hold
it
as
he
spoke
an
orderly
came
into
his
billet
a
small
farmhouse
saluted
and
handed
him
a
pink
slip
which
was
a
telephone
message
i
watched
him
read
it
and
saw
the
sudden
pallor
of
his
face
and
noticed
how
the
room
shook
with
the
constant
reverberation
of
distant
a
big
bombardment
was
in
progress
over
vimy
way
excuse
me
said
the
colonel
things
seem
to
be
happening
i
must
go
at
he
went
through
the
window
leaping
the
sill
and
a
look
of
bad
tidings
went
with
him
his
men
had
been
blown
out
of
the
craters
a
staff
officer
sat
in
the
brigade
office
and
when
the
had
gone
raised
his
head
and
looked
across
to
me
i
am
a
critic
of
these
affairs
he
said
they
seem
to
me
too
expensive
but
i
here
to
do
what
i
am
we
did
not
regain
the
vimy
craters
until
a
year
afterward
when
the
canadians
and
scottish
captured
all
the
vimy
ridge
in
a
great
assault
xx
the
winter
of
discontent
had
passed
summer
had
come
with
a
wealth
of
beauty
in
the
fields
of
france
this
side
the
belt
of
blasted
earth
the
grass
was
a
tapestry
of
flowers
and
tits
and
warblers
and
the
golden
oriole
were
making
music
in
the
woods
at
dusk
the
nightingale
sang
as
though
no
war
were
near
its
love
and
at
broad
noonday
a
million
larks
rose
above
the
tall
wheat
with
a
great
high
chorus
of
glad
notes
among
the
british
armies
there
was
hope
again
immense
faith
that
believed
once
more
in
an
ending
to
the
war
verdun
had
been
saved
the
enemy
had
been
slaughtered
his
reserves
were
thin
and
hard
to
get
so
said
intelligence
and
the
british
stronger
than
they
had
ever
been
in
men
and
guns
and
shells
and
aircraft
and
all
material
of
war
were
going
to
be
launched
in
a
great
offensive
no
more
trench
warfare
no
more
dying
in
ditches
out
into
the
open
with
an
army
of
pursuit
rawlinson
and
a
quick
it
was
to
be
the
great
the
last
battles
were
to
be
fought
before
the
year
died
again
though
many
men
would
die
before
that
time
up
in
the
salient
something
happened
to
make
men
question
the
weakness
of
the
enemy
but
the
news
did
not
spread
very
far
and
there
was
a
lot
to
do
elsewhere
on
the
somme
where
the
salient
seemed
a
long
way
off
it
was
the
canadians
to
whom
it
happened
and
it
was
an
ugly
thing
on
june
a
flame
of
fire
from
many
batteries
opened
upon
their
lines
in
sanctuary
wood
and
maple
copse
beyond
the
lines
of
ypres
and
tragedy
befell
them
i
went
to
see
those
who
lived
through
it
and
stood
in
the
presence
of
men
who
had
escaped
from
the
very
pits
of
that
hell
which
had
been
invented
by
human
beings
out
of
the
earth
chemistry
and
yet
had
kept
their
reason
the
enemy
bombardment
began
suddenly
with
one
great
crash
of
guns
at
half
past
eight
on
friday
morning
generals
mercer
and
williams
had
gone
up
to
inspect
the
trenches
at
six
in
the
morning
it
had
been
almost
silent
along
the
lines
when
the
enemy
batteries
opened
fire
with
one
enormous
thunderstroke
which
was
followed
by
continuous
salvos
the
shells
came
from
nearly
every
point
of
the
compass
north
east
and
south
the
evil
spell
of
the
salient
was
over
our
men
again
in
the
trenches
just
south
of
hooge
were
the
princess
patricia
light
infantry
with
some
battalions
of
the
royal
canadian
regiment
south
of
them
and
some
of
the
canadian
mounted
rifles
who
had
long
been
dismounted
and
units
from
another
canadian
division
at
the
extreme
end
of
their
line
of
front
it
was
those
men
who
had
to
suffer
the
tempest
of
the
enemy
shells
earth
below
them
opened
up
into
great
craters
as
shells
burst
continually
flinging
up
masses
of
soil
flattening
out
breastworks
and
scattering
into
dust
canadians
in
the
front
trenches
held
on
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
they
took
it
all
said
one
of
the
officers
and
in
that
phrase
spoken
simply
by
a
man
who
was
there
too
lies
the
spirit
of
pride
and
sacrifice
they
took
it
all
and
did
not
budge
though
the
sky
seemed
to
be
opening
above
them
and
the
earth
below
them
the
bombardment
continued
without
a
pause
for
five
hours
by
which
time
most
of
our
front
trenches
had
been
annihilated
at
about
a
quarter
past
one
the
enemy
guns
lifted
a
little
and
through
the
dense
which
made
a
solid
bar
across
no
man
land
appeared
a
mass
of
german
infantry
they
wore
their
packs
and
full
as
though
they
had
come
to
stay
perhaps
they
expected
that
no
one
lived
in
the
british
trenches
and
it
was
a
reasonable
idea
but
wrong
there
were
brave
men
remaining
there
alive
and
determined
to
fight
although
the
order
for
retirement
had
been
given
single
figures
here
and
there
were
seen
to
get
over
the
broken
parapets
and
go
forward
to
meet
the
enemy
halfway
they
died
to
a
man
fighting
it
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
most
pitiful
and
heroic
things
of
this
war
that
little
crowd
of
men
many
of
them
wounded
some
of
them
dazed
and
deaf
stumbling
forward
to
their
certain
death
to
oppose
the
enemy
advance
from
the
network
of
trenches
behind
not
altogether
smashed
there
was
time
for
men
to
retire
to
a
second
line
of
defense
if
they
were
still
unwounded
and
had
strength
to
go
an
officer
captain
crossman
in
command
of
one
of
these
support
companies
brought
several
men
out
of
a
trench
but
did
not
follow
on
he
turned
again
facing
the
enemy
and
was
last
seen
a
big
husky
man
says
one
of
his
comrades
as
he
fired
his
revolver
and
then
flung
it
into
a
german
face
colonel
shaw
of
the
battalion
rallied
eighty
men
out
of
the
cumberland
dugouts
and
died
fighting
the
germans
were
kept
at
bay
for
some
time
but
they
flung
their
bombs
into
the
square
of
men
so
that
very
few
remained
alive
when
only
eight
were
still
fighting
among
the
bodies
of
their
comrades
these
tattered
and
men
standing
there
fiercely
contemptuous
of
the
enemy
and
death
were
ordered
to
retire
by
major
palmer
the
last
officer
among
them
meanwhile
the
battalions
in
support
were
holding
firm
in
spite
of
the
which
raged
above
them
also
and
it
was
against
this
second
line
of
canadians
that
the
german
infantry
came
up
and
broke
in
the
center
the
german
thrust
was
hard
toward
zillebeke
lake
here
some
of
the
canadian
rifles
were
in
support
and
as
soon
as
the
infantry
attack
began
they
were
ordered
forward
to
meet
and
check
the
enemy
an
officer
in
command
of
one
of
their
battalions
afterward
told
me
that
he
led
his
men
across
country
to
maple
copse
under
such
a
fire
as
he
had
never
seen
because
of
the
comrades
in
front
in
dire
need
of
help
no
notice
was
taken
as
the
wounded
fell
but
the
others
pressed
on
as
fast
as
they
could
go
maple
copse
was
reached
and
here
the
men
halted
and
awaited
the
enemy
with
another
battalion
who
were
already
holding
this
wood
of
six
or
seven
acres
when
the
german
troops
arrived
they
may
have
expected
to
meet
no
great
resistance
they
met
a
withering
fire
which
caused
them
bloody
losses
the
canadians
had
assembled
at
various
points
which
became
strongholds
of
defense
with
and
bomb
stores
and
the
men
held
their
fire
until
the
enemy
was
within
close
range
so
that
they
worked
havoc
among
them
but
the
german
guns
never
ceased
and
many
canadians
fell
baker
a
member
of
the
canadian
parliament
fell
with
a
piece
of
shell
in
his
lung
hour
after
hour
our
gunners
fed
their
breeches
and
poured
out
shells
the
edge
of
the
salient
was
swept
with
fire
and
though
the
canadian
losses
were
frightful
the
germans
suffered
also
so
that
the
battlefield
was
one
great
shambles
our
own
wounded
who
were
brought
back
owe
their
lives
to
the
who
were
supreme
in
devotion
they
worked
in
and
out
across
that
ground
hour
after
hour
through
the
day
and
night
rescuing
many
stricken
men
at
a
great
cost
in
life
to
themselves
out
of
one
party
of
twenty
only
five
remained
alive
no
one
can
say
said
one
of
their
officers
that
the
canadians
do
not
know
how
to
no
one
would
deny
that
out
of
three
thousand
men
in
the
canadian
brigade
their
casualties
were
hundred
there
were
survivors
from
the
battalion
canadian
mounted
rifles
from
the
battalion
from
the
from
the
those
are
the
figures
of
massacre
eleven
days
later
the
canadians
took
their
revenge
their
own
guns
were
but
a
small
part
of
the
huge
orchestra
of
heavies
and
field
batteries
which
played
the
devil
tattoo
upon
the
german
positions
in
our
old
trenches
it
was
annihilating
and
the
german
soldiers
had
to
endure
the
same
experience
as
their
guns
had
given
to
canadian
troops
on
the
same
ground
trenches
already
battered
were
smashed
again
the
earth
which
was
plowed
with
shells
in
their
own
attack
was
flung
up
again
by
our
shells
it
was
hell
again
for
poor
human
wretches
the
canadian
troops
charged
at
two
in
the
morning
their
attack
was
directed
to
the
part
of
the
line
from
the
southern
end
of
sanctuary
wood
to
mount
gorst
about
a
mile
which
included
armagh
wood
observatory
hill
and
mount
gorst
itself
the
attack
went
quickly
and
the
men
expected
greater
trouble
the
enemy
was
heavy
but
the
canadians
got
through
under
cover
of
their
own
guns
which
had
lengthened
their
fuses
a
little
and
continued
an
intense
bombardment
behind
the
enemy
first
line
the
men
advanced
in
open
order
and
worked
downward
and
southward
into
their
old
positions
in
one
place
of
attack
about
forty
germans
who
fought
desperately
were
killed
almost
to
a
man
just
as
colonel
shaw
had
died
on
june
with
his
party
of
eighty
men
who
had
rallied
round
him
it
was
one
shambles
for
another
and
the
germans
were
not
less
brave
it
seems
one
officer
and
one
hundred
and
thirteen
men
surrendered
the
officer
was
glad
to
escape
from
the
death
to
which
he
had
resigned
himself
when
our
bombardment
began
i
knew
how
it
would
be
he
said
we
had
orders
to
take
this
ground
and
took
it
but
we
knew
you
would
come
back
again
you
had
to
do
so
so
here
i
parts
of
the
line
were
deserted
except
by
the
dead
in
one
place
the
stores
which
had
been
buried
by
the
canadians
before
they
left
were
still
there
untouched
by
the
enemy
our
bombardment
had
made
it
impossible
for
his
troops
to
consolidate
their
position
and
to
hold
the
line
steady
they
had
just
taken
cover
in
the
old
bits
of
trench
in
and
craters
and
behind
scattered
and
had
been
pounded
there
the
canadians
were
back
again
part
five
the
heart
of
a
city
amiens
in
time
of
war
i
during
the
battles
of
the
somme
in
and
afterward
in
periods
of
progress
and
retreat
over
the
abominable
fields
the
city
of
amiens
was
the
capital
of
the
british
army
when
the
battles
began
in
july
of
that
year
it
was
only
a
short
distance
away
from
the
near
enough
to
hear
the
incessant
roar
of
on
the
french
front
and
ours
and
near
enough
to
get
by
or
lorry
in
less
than
thirty
minutes
to
places
where
men
were
being
killed
or
maimed
or
blinded
in
the
routine
of
the
day
work
one
went
out
past
amiens
station
and
across
a
little
stone
bridge
which
afterward
in
the
enemy
advance
of
became
the
mark
for
german
high
velocities
along
the
road
to
querrieux
where
rawlinson
had
his
headquarters
of
the
fourth
army
in
an
old
chateau
with
pleasant
meadows
round
it
and
a
stream
meandering
through
fields
of
buttercups
in
beyond
the
dusty
village
of
querrieux
with
its
white
cottages
from
which
the
plaster
fell
off
in
blotches
as
the
war
went
on
we
went
along
the
straight
highroad
to
albert
through
the
long
and
straggling
village
of
lahoussoye
where
scottish
soldiers
in
reserve
lounged
about
among
frowsy
peasant
women
and
played
solemn
games
with
the
bairns
and
so
past
camps
and
hutments
on
each
side
of
the
road
to
the
ugly
town
where
the
golden
virgin
hung
head
downward
from
the
broken
tower
of
the
church
with
her
babe
outstretched
above
the
fields
of
death
as
though
as
a
to
this
world
at
war
one
could
be
killed
any
day
in
albert
i
saw
men
blown
to
bits
there
the
clay
after
the
battles
of
the
somme
began
it
was
in
the
road
that
turned
to
the
right
past
the
square
to
go
to
meaulte
and
on
to
fricourt
there
was
a
tide
of
gun
transport
swirling
down
the
road
bringing
up
new
ammunition
for
the
guns
that
were
firing
without
a
pause
over
fricourt
and
mametz
the
high
scream
of
a
shell
came
through
a
blue
sky
and
ended
on
its
downward
note
with
a
sharp
crash
for
a
few
minutes
the
transport
column
was
held
up
while
a
mass
of
raw
flesh
which
a
second
before
had
been
two
living
men
and
their
horses
was
cleared
out
of
the
way
then
the
gun
wagons
went
at
a
harder
pace
down
the
road
raising
a
cloud
of
white
dust
out
of
which
i
heard
the
curses
of
the
drivers
swearing
in
a
foul
way
to
disguise
their
fear
i
went
through
albert
many
scores
of
times
to
the
battlefields
beyond
and
watched
its
process
of
disintegration
through
those
years
until
it
was
nothing
but
a
wild
scrap
heap
of
read
brick
and
twisted
iron
and
in
the
last
phase
even
the
golden
virgin
and
her
babe
which
had
seemed
to
escape
all
by
miraculous
powers
lay
buried
beneath
a
mass
of
masonry
beyond
were
the
battlefields
of
the
somme
where
every
yard
of
ground
is
part
of
the
great
graveyard
of
our
youth
so
amiens
as
i
have
said
was
not
far
away
from
the
red
heart
of
war
and
was
clear
enough
to
the
lines
to
be
crowded
always
with
officers
and
men
who
came
out
between
one
battle
and
another
and
by
could
reach
this
city
for
a
few
hours
of
civilized
life
according
to
their
views
of
civilization
to
these
men
boys
mostly
who
had
been
living
in
lousy
ditches
under
hell
fire
amiens
was
paradise
with
little
hells
for
those
who
liked
them
there
were
hotels
in
which
they
could
go
get
a
bath
if
they
waited
long
enough
or
had
the
luck
to
be
early
on
the
list
there
were
streets
of
shops
with
windows
unbroken
shining
beautiful
there
were
women
walking
about
with
kind
eyes
and
children
as
dainty
some
of
them
as
in
high
street
kensington
or
prince
street
edinburgh
young
officers
who
had
plenty
of
money
to
spend
because
there
was
no
chance
of
spending
money
between
a
row
of
blasted
trees
and
a
ditch
in
which
bits
of
dead
men
were
plastered
into
the
parapet
invaded
the
shops
and
bought
fancy
soaps
razors
stationery
pocketbooks
knives
at
a
fabulous
price
khaki
shirts
and
collars
gramophone
records
and
the
latest
set
of
kirchner
prints
it
was
the
delight
of
spending
rather
than
the
joy
of
possessing
which
made
them
go
from
one
shop
to
another
in
search
of
things
they
could
carry
hack
to
the
line
that
and
the
lure
of
girls
behind
the
counters
laughing
girls
who
understood
their
execrable
french
even
english
spoken
with
a
glasgow
accent
and
were
pleased
to
flirt
for
five
minutes
with
any
group
of
young
who
broke
into
roars
of
laughter
at
the
gallantry
of
some
don
juan
among
them
with
the
gift
of
audacity
and
paid
outrageous
prices
for
the
privilege
of
stammering
out
some
foolish
sentiment
in
broken
french
blushing
to
the
roots
of
their
hair
though
captains
and
heroes
at
their
own
temerity
with
a
girl
who
in
another
five
minutes
would
play
the
same
part
in
the
same
scene
with
a
different
group
of
boys
i
used
to
marvel
at
the
patience
of
these
girls
how
bored
they
must
have
been
with
all
this
flirtation
which
led
to
nothing
except
perhaps
the
purchase
of
a
bit
of
soap
at
twice
its
proper
price
they
knew
that
these
boys
would
leave
to
go
back
to
the
trenches
in
a
few
hours
and
that
some
of
them
would
certainly
be
dead
in
a
few
days
there
could
be
no
romantic
episode
save
of
a
transient
kind
between
them
and
these
lads
in
whose
eyes
there
were
desire
and
hunger
because
to
them
the
plainest
girl
was
womanhood
the
sweet
gentle
and
feminine
side
of
life
as
opposed
to
the
cruelty
brutality
and
ugliness
of
war
and
death
the
shopgirls
of
amiens
had
no
illusions
they
had
lived
too
long
in
war
not
to
know
the
realities
they
knew
the
risks
of
transient
love
and
they
were
not
taking
them
unless
conditions
were
very
favorable
they
attended
strictly
to
business
and
hoped
to
make
a
lot
of
money
in
the
shop
and
were
i
think
mostly
good
girls
as
virtuous
as
life
in
may
let
girls
be
wise
beyond
their
years
and
with
pity
behind
their
laughter
for
these
soldiers
who
tried
to
touch
their
hands
over
the
counters
knowing
that
many
of
them
were
doomed
to
die
for
france
and
england
they
had
their
own
lovers
boys
in
blue
somewhere
between
and
hartmanns
weilerkopf
and
apart
from
occasional
intimacies
with
english
officers
quartered
in
amiens
for
long
spells
left
the
traffic
of
passion
to
other
women
who
walked
the
streets
ii
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
la
rue
des
trois
cailloux
which
goes
up
from
the
station
through
the
heart
of
amiens
was
the
crowded
highway
here
were
the
best
shops
the
hairdresser
at
the
side
where
all
day
long
officers
down
from
the
line
came
in
to
have
elaborate
luxury
in
the
way
of
close
crops
with
friction
de
quinine
shampooing
singeing
oiling
not
because
of
vanity
but
because
of
the
joyous
sense
of
cleanliness
and
perfume
after
the
filth
and
stench
of
life
in
the
desolate
fields
then
the
booksellers
madame
carpentier
et
fille
on
the
side
which
was
not
only
the
rendezvous
of
the
miscellaneous
crowd
buying
stationery
and
la
vie
parisienne
but
of
the
intellectuals
who
spoke
good
french
and
bought
good
books
and
liked
ten
minutes
chat
with
the
mother
and
daughter
madame
was
an
alsatian
lady
with
vivid
memories
of
when
as
a
child
she
had
first
learned
to
hate
germans
she
hated
them
now
with
a
fresh
vital
hatred
and
would
have
seen
her
own
son
dead
a
hundred
times
he
was
a
soldier
in
saloniki
rather
than
that
france
should
make
a
compromise
peace
with
the
enemy
she
had
been
in
amiens
as
i
was
on
a
dreadful
night
of
august
of
when
the
french
army
passed
through
in
retreat
from
bapaume
and
she
and
the
people
of
her
city
knew
for
the
first
time
that
the
germans
were
close
upon
them
she
stood
in
the
crowd
as
i
did
in
the
darkness
watching
that
french
column
pass
with
their
transport
and
their
wounded
lying
on
the
baggage
wagons
men
of
many
regiments
mixed
up
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
shining
on
the
casques
of
cuirassiers
with
their
long
horsehair
tails
leading
their
stumbling
horses
and
foot
soldiers
hunched
under
their
packs
marching
silently
with
dragging
steps
once
in
a
while
one
of
the
soldiers
left
the
ranks
and
came
on
to
the
sidewalk
whispering
to
a
group
of
dark
shadows
the
crowds
watched
silently
in
a
curious
dreadful
silence
as
though
stunned
a
woman
near
me
spoke
in
a
low
voice
and
said
nous
sommes
perdus
those
were
the
only
words
i
heard
or
remembered
that
night
in
the
station
of
amiens
the
boys
of
a
new
class
were
being
hurried
away
in
truck
trains
and
while
their
army
was
in
retreat
sang
la
marseillaise
as
though
victory
were
in
their
hearts
next
day
the
german
army
under
von
kluck
entered
amiens
and
ten
days
afterward
passed
through
it
on
the
way
to
paris
madame
carpentier
told
me
of
the
first
terror
of
the
people
when
the
men
came
down
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
and
entered
their
shops
a
boy
selling
oranges
fainted
when
a
german
stretched
out
his
hand
to
buy
some
women
hid
behind
their
counters
when
german
boots
stamped
into
their
shops
but
madame
carpentier
was
not
afraid
she
knew
the
germans
and
their
language
she
spoke
frank
words
to
german
officers
who
saluted
her
respectfully
enough
you
will
never
get
to
paris
france
and
england
will
be
too
strong
for
you
germany
will
be
destroyed
before
this
war
they
laughed
at
her
and
said
we
shall
be
in
paris
in
a
week
from
now
have
you
a
little
diary
madame
madame
carpentier
was
haughty
with
them
some
women
of
amiens
poor
drabs
did
not
show
any
haughtiness
nor
any
pride
with
the
enemy
who
crowded
into
the
city
on
their
way
toward
paris
a
girl
told
me
that
she
was
looking
through
the
window
of
a
house
that
faced
the
place
de
la
gare
and
saw
a
number
of
german
soldiers
dancing
round
a
which
was
playing
to
them
they
were
dancing
with
women
of
the
town
who
were
laughing
and
screeching
in
the
embrace
of
big
blond
germans
the
girl
who
was
watching
was
only
a
schoolgirl
then
she
knew
very
little
of
the
evil
of
life
but
enough
to
know
that
there
was
something
in
this
scene
degrading
to
womanhood
and
to
france
she
turned
from
the
window
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
and
wept
bitterly
i
used
to
call
in
at
the
bookshop
for
a
chat
now
and
then
with
madame
and
mademoiselle
carpentier
while
a
crowd
of
officers
came
in
and
out
madame
was
always
merry
and
bright
in
spite
of
her
denunciations
of
the
sale
boches
les
brigands
les
bandits
and
mademoiselle
put
my
knowledge
of
french
to
a
severe
but
pleasant
test
she
spoke
with
alarming
rapidity
her
words
tumbling
over
one
another
in
a
cascade
of
volubility
delightful
to
hear
but
difficult
to
follow
she
had
a
strong
mind
masterly
in
her
methods
of
business
so
that
she
could
serve
six
customers
at
once
and
make
each
one
think
that
her
attention
was
entirely
devoted
to
his
needs
and
a
very
shrewd
and
critical
idea
of
military
strategy
and
organization
she
had
but
a
poor
opinion
of
british
generals
and
generalship
although
a
wholehearted
admiration
for
the
gallantry
of
british
officers
and
men
and
she
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
our
preparations
plans
failures
and
losses
french
confided
to
her
the
secrets
of
the
british
army
and
english
officers
trusted
her
with
many
revelations
of
things
in
the
but
mademoiselle
carpentier
had
discretion
and
loyalty
and
did
not
repeat
these
things
to
people
who
had
no
right
to
know
she
would
have
been
far
more
efficient
as
a
staff
officer
than
many
of
the
young
gentlemen
with
red
tabs
on
their
tunics
who
came
into
the
shop
flipping
beautiful
with
sitting
on
the
counter
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
la
vie
for
the
latest
convention
in
legs
mademoiselle
was
a
serious
musician
so
her
mother
told
me
but
her
musical
studies
were
seriously
interrupted
by
business
and
air
raids
which
one
day
ceased
in
amiens
altogether
after
a
night
of
horror
when
hundreds
of
houses
were
smashed
to
dust
and
many
people
killed
and
the
germans
brought
their
guns
close
to
the
city
close
enough
to
scatter
high
velocities
about
its
streets
and
the
population
came
up
out
of
their
cellars
shaken
by
the
terror
of
the
night
and
fled
i
passed
the
bookshop
where
mademoiselle
was
locking
up
the
door
of
this
house
which
had
escaped
by
greater
luck
than
its
neighbors
she
turned
as
i
passed
and
raised
her
hand
with
a
grave
gesture
of
resignation
and
courage
ils
ne
passeront
pas
she
said
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
courage
of
french
womanhood
which
spoke
in
those
words
iii
that
was
in
the
last
phase
of
the
war
but
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
had
been
tramped
up
and
down
for
two
years
before
then
by
the
british
armies
on
the
somme
with
the
french
on
their
right
i
was
never
tired
of
watching
those
crowds
and
getting
into
the
midst
of
them
and
studying
their
types
all
the
types
of
young
english
manhood
came
down
this
street
and
some
of
their
faces
showed
the
strain
and
agony
of
war
especially
toward
the
end
of
the
somme
battles
after
four
months
or
more
of
slaughter
i
saw
boys
with
a
kind
of
hunted
look
in
their
eyes
and
death
was
the
hunter
they
stared
into
the
shop
windows
in
a
dazed
way
or
strode
along
with
packs
on
their
backs
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
and
white
haggard
faces
as
expressionless
as
masks
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
perhaps
the
hunter
would
track
them
down
other
english
officers
showed
no
sign
at
all
of
apprehension
or
lack
of
although
the
psychologist
would
have
detected
disorder
of
soul
in
the
rather
deliberate
note
of
hilarity
with
which
they
greeted
their
friends
in
gusts
of
laughter
for
no
apparent
cause
at
charlie
bar
where
they
would
drink
three
cocktails
apiece
on
an
empty
stomach
and
in
their
tendency
to
tell
tales
of
horror
as
things
that
were
very
funny
they
dined
and
wined
in
amiens
at
the
rhin
the
godebert
or
the
cathedrale
with
a
kind
of
spiritual
exaltation
in
good
food
and
drink
as
though
subconsciously
they
believed
that
this
might
be
their
last
dinner
in
life
with
good
pals
about
them
they
wanted
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
damn
the
price
in
that
spirit
many
of
them
went
after
other
pleasures
down
the
byways
of
the
city
and
damned
the
price
again
which
was
a
hellish
one
who
blames
them
it
was
war
that
was
to
blame
and
those
who
made
war
possible
down
the
rue
des
trois
cailloux
up
and
down
up
and
down
went
english
and
scottish
and
irish
and
welsh
and
canadian
and
australian
and
new
zealand
fighting
men
in
the
winter
they
wore
their
all
splashed
and
caked
up
to
the
shoulders
with
the
white
chalky
mud
of
the
somme
battlefields
and
their
top
boots
and
puttees
were
plastered
with
this
mud
and
their
faces
were
smeared
with
it
after
a
lorry
drive
or
a
tramp
down
from
the
line
the
rain
beat
with
a
metallic
tattoo
on
their
steel
hats
their
packs
were
all
sodden
french
poilus
detrained
at
amiens
station
for
a
night
on
their
way
to
some
other
part
of
the
front
jostled
among
british
soldiers
and
their
packs
were
a
wonder
to
see
they
were
like
traveling
tinkers
with
pots
and
pans
and
boots
slung
about
their
faded
blue
coats
and
packs
bulging
with
all
the
primitive
needs
of
life
in
the
desert
of
the
battlefields
beyond
civilization
they
were
unshaven
and
wore
their
steel
casques
low
over
their
foreheads
without
gaiety
without
the
means
of
buying
a
little
false
hilarity
but
grim
and
sullen
looking
and
resentful
of
english
soldiers
walking
or
talking
with
french
cocottes
iv
i
saw
a
scene
with
a
french
poilu
one
day
in
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
during
those
battles
of
the
somme
when
the
french
troops
were
fighting
on
our
right
from
maricourt
southward
toward
roye
it
was
like
a
scene
from
the
poilu
was
a
man
and
very
drunk
on
some
foul
spirit
which
he
had
bought
in
a
low
cafe
down
by
the
river
in
the
high
street
he
was
noisy
and
cursed
god
for
having
allowed
the
war
to
happen
and
the
french
government
for
having
sentenced
him
and
all
poor
sacre
poilus
to
rot
to
death
in
the
trenches
away
from
their
wives
and
children
without
a
thought
for
them
and
nothing
but
treachery
in
paris
nous
sommes
trahis
said
the
man
raising
his
arms
for
the
hundredth
time
france
is
a
crowd
gathered
round
him
listening
to
his
drunken
denunciations
no
one
laughed
they
stared
at
him
with
a
kind
of
pitying
wonderment
an
agent
de
police
pushed
his
way
between
the
people
and
caught
hold
of
the
soldier
by
the
wrist
and
tried
to
drag
him
away
the
crowd
murmured
a
protest
and
then
suddenly
the
poilu
finding
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
police
on
this
one
day
out
of
the
trenches
after
five
months
flung
himself
on
the
pavement
in
a
passion
of
tears
and
supplication
je
suis
pere
de
famille
je
suis
un
soldat
de
france
dans
les
tranchees
pour
cinq
mois
que
mes
camarades
vont
dire

et
mon
capitaine
emmordant
apres
toute
ma
service
comme
brave
soldat
mais
quoi
donc
mon
vieux
viens
donc
saligaud
growled
the
agent
de
police
the
crowd
was
against
the
policeman
their
murmurs
rose
to
violent
protest
on
behalf
of
the
poilu
un
heros
tout
de
meme
cinq
mois
dans
les
tranches
affreux
mais
oui
il
est
soul
mais
pour
quoi
pas
apres
cinq
mois
sur
le
front
que
cela
signifie
ca
aucune
importance
a
dandy
french
officer
of
chasseurs
alpins
stepped
into
the
center
of
the
scene
and
tapped
the
policeman
on
the
shoulder
leave
him
alone
do
you
see
he
is
a
soldier
sacred
name
of
god
do
you
know
that
a
man
like
this
has
helped
to
save
france
while
you
pigs
stand
at
street
corners
watching
petticoats
he
stooped
to
the
fallen
man
and
helped
him
to
stand
straight
be
off
with
you
mon
brave
or
there
will
be
trouble
for
he
beckoned
to
two
of
his
own
chasseurs
and
said
look
after
that
poor
comrade
yonder
he
is
un
peu
the
crowd
applauded
their
sympathy
was
all
for
the
drunken
soldier
of
france
v
into
a
small
estaminet
at
the
end
of
the
rue
des
trois
cailloux
beyond
the
hotel
de
ville
came
one
day
during
the
battles
of
the
somme
two
poilus
grizzled
heavy
men
deeply
bronzed
with
white
dust
in
their
wrinkles
and
the
earth
of
the
battlefields
ingrained
in
the
skin
of
their
big
coarse
hands
they
ordered
two
little
glasses
and
drank
them
at
one
gulp
then
two
more
see
what
i
have
got
my
little
cabbage
said
one
of
them
stooping
to
the
heavy
pack
which
he
had
shifted
from
his
shoulders
to
the
other
seat
beside
him
it
is
something
to
make
you
and
what
is
that
my
old
one
said
a
woman
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
another
woman
of
her
own
class
from
the
market
nearby
the
man
did
not
answer
the
question
but
fumbled
into
his
pack
laughing
a
little
in
a
way
i
killed
a
german
to
get
it
he
said
he
was
a
pig
of
an
officer
a
dirty
boche
very
chic
too
and
young
like
a
one
of
the
women
patted
him
on
the
shoulder
her
eyes
glistened
did
you
slit
his
throat
the
dirty
dog
eh
i
like
to
get
my
fingers
round
the
neck
of
a
dirty
boche
i
finished
him
with
a
grenade
said
the
poilu
it
was
good
enough
it
knocked
a
hole
in
him
as
large
as
a
cemetery
see
then
my
cabbage
it
will
make
you
smile
it
is
a
funny
kind
of
mascot
eh
he
put
on
the
table
a
small
leather
pouch
stained
with
a
blotch
of
reddish
brown
his
big
clumsy
fingers
could
hardly
undo
the
little
clasp
he
wore
this
next
his
heart
said
the
man
perhaps
he
thought
it
would
bring
him
luck
but
i
killed
him
all
the
same
nom
de
dieu
he
undid
the
clasp
and
his
big
fingers
poked
inside
the
flap
of
the
pouch
it
was
from
his
woman
his
german
grue
perhaps
even
now
she
know
he
dead
she
thinks
of
him
wearing
this
next
to
his
heart
nom
de
dieu
it
was
i
that
killed
him
a
week
ago
he
held
up
something
in
his
hand
and
the
light
through
the
estaminet
window
gleamed
on
it
it
was
a
woman
lock
of
hair
like
gold
the
two
women
gave
a
shrill
cry
of
surprise
and
then
screamed
with
laughter
one
of
them
tried
to
grab
the
hair
but
the
poilu
held
it
high
beyond
her
reach
with
a
gruff
command
of
hands
off
other
soldiers
and
women
in
the
estaminet
gathered
round
staring
at
the
yellow
tress
laughing
making
ribald
conjectures
as
to
the
character
of
the
woman
from
whose
head
it
had
come
they
agreed
that
she
was
fat
and
ugly
like
all
german
women
and
a
foul
slut
she
never
kiss
that
fellow
again
said
one
man
our
old
one
has
cut
the
throat
of
that
pig
of
a
boche
i
like
to
cut
off
all
her
hair
and
tear
the
clothes
off
her
back
said
one
of
the
women
the
dirty
drab
with
yellow
hair
they
ought
to
be
killed
every
one
of
them
so
that
the
human
race
should
by
rid
of
them
her
lover
is
a
bit
of
clay
anyhow
said
the
other
woman
a
bit
of
dirt
as
our
poilus
will
do
for
all
of
the
soldier
with
the
woman
hair
in
his
hand
stroked
it
across
his
forefinger
all
the
same
it
is
pretty
like
gold
eh
i
think
of
the
woman
sometimes
with
blue
eyes
like
a
german
girl
i
kissed
in
there
was
a
howl
of
laughter
from
the
two
women
the
old
one
is
drunk
he
is
amorous
with
the
german
cow
i
will
keep
it
as
a
mascot
said
the
poilu
scrunching
it
up
and
thrusting
it
into
his
pouch
it
keep
me
in
mind
of
that
saligaud
of
a
german
officer
i
killed
he
was
a
chic
fellow
tout
de
meme
a
vi
australians
slouched
up
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
with
a
grim
look
under
their
hats
having
come
down
from
pozieres
where
it
was
always
hell
in
the
days
of
the
somme
fighting
i
liked
the
look
of
them
dusty
up
to
the
eyes
in
summer
muddy
up
to
their
eyes
in
winter
these
gipsy
fellows
scornful
of
discipline
for
sake
but
desperate
fighters
as
simple
as
children
in
their
ways
of
thought
and
speech
except
for
frightful
oaths
and
looking
at
life
this
life
of
war
and
this
life
in
amiens
with
frank
curious
eyes
and
a
kind
of
humorous
contempt
for
death
and
disease
and
english
tommies
and
french
girls
and
the
whole
damned
show
as
they
called
it
they
were
lawless
except
for
the
laws
to
which
their
souls
gave
allegiance
they
behaved
as
the
equals
of
all
men
giving
no
respect
to
generals
or
or
the
devils
of
hell
there
was
a
primitive
spirit
of
manhood
in
them
and
they
took
what
they
wanted
and
were
ready
to
pay
for
it
in
coin
or
in
disease
or
in
wounds
they
had
no
conceit
of
themselves
in
a
little
vain
way
but
they
reckoned
themselves
the
only
simply
and
without
boasting
they
were
hard
as
steel
and
finely
tempered
some
of
them
were
ruffians
but
most
of
them
were
i
imagine
like
those
english
yeomen
who
came
into
france
with
the
black
prince
men
who
lived
rough
close
to
nature
of
sturdy
independence
though
fierce
in
a
fight
and
ruthless
that
is
how
they
seemed
to
me
in
a
general
way
though
among
them
were
boys
of
a
more
delicate
fiber
and
sensitive
if
one
might
judge
by
their
features
and
wistful
eyes
they
had
money
to
spend
beyond
the
dreams
of
our
poor
tommy
six
shillings
and
sixpence
a
day
and
remittances
from
home
so
they
pushed
open
the
doors
of
any
restaurant
in
amiens
and
sat
down
to
table
next
to
english
officers
not
abashed
and
ordered
anything
that
pleased
their
taste
and
wine
in
plenty
in
that
high
street
of
amiens
one
day
i
saw
a
crowd
gathered
round
an
australian
so
tall
that
he
towered
over
all
other
heads
it
was
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
corps
nu
sans
teste
the
street
of
the
naked
body
without
a
head
and
i
suspected
trouble
as
i
pressed
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
i
heard
the
australian
ask
in
a
loud
slow
drawl
whether
there
was
any
officer
about
who
could
speak
french
he
asked
the
question
gravely
but
without
anxiety
i
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
said
i
speak
french
what
the
trouble
i
saw
then
that
like
the
french
poilu
i
have
described
this
tall
australian
was
in
the
grasp
of
a
french
agent
de
police
a
small
man
of
whom
he
took
no
more
notice
than
if
a
fly
had
settled
on
his
wrist
the
australian
was
not
drunk
i
could
see
that
he
had
just
drunk
enough
to
make
his
brain
very
clear
and
solemn
he
explained
the
matter
deliberately
with
a
slow
choice
of
words
as
though
giving
evidence
of
high
matters
before
a
court
it
appeared
that
he
had
gone
into
the
estaminet
opposite
with
four
friends
they
had
ordered
five
glasses
of
porto
for
which
they
had
paid
twenty
centimes
each
and
drank
them
they
then
ordered
five
more
glasses
of
porto
and
paid
the
same
price
and
drank
them
after
this
they
took
a
stroll
up
and
down
the
street
and
were
bored
and
went
into
the
estaminet
again
and
ordered
five
more
glasses
of
porto
it
was
then
the
trouble
began
but
it
was
not
the
australian
who
began
it
it
was
the
woman
behind
the
bar
she
served
five
glasses
more
of
porto
and
asked
for
thirty
centimes
each
twenty
centimes
said
the
australian
vingt
mais
non
trente
centimes
chaque
verre
thirty
my
old
one
six
sous
comprenez
no
comprennye
said
the
australian
vingt
centimes
or
go
to
the
woman
demanded
the
thirty
centimes
kept
on
demanding
with
a
voice
more
shrill
it
was
her
voice
that
vexed
me
said
the
australian
that
and
the
bloody
the
five
australians
drank
the
five
glasses
of
porto
and
the
tall
australian
paid
the
thirty
centimes
each
without
further
argument
life
is
too
short
for
argument
then
without
words
he
took
each
of
the
five
glasses
broke
it
at
the
stem
and
dropped
it
over
the
counter
you
will
see
sir
he
said
gravely
the
justice
of
the
matter
on
my
but
when
they
left
the
estaminet
the
woman
came
shrieking
into
the
street
after
them
hence
the
agent
de
police
and
the
grasp
on
the
australian
wrist
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
explain
the
case
to
this
little
frenchman
said
the
soldier
if
he
does
not
take
his
hand
off
my
wrist
i
shall
have
to
kill
perhaps
a
little
explanation
might
serve
i
said
i
spoke
to
the
agent
de
police
at
some
length
describing
the
incident
in
the
cafe
i
took
the
view
that
the
lady
was
wrong
in
increasing
the
price
so
rapidly
the
agent
agreed
gravely
i
then
pointed
out
that
the
australian
was
a
very
man
and
that
in
spite
of
his
quietude
he
was
a
man
in
the
habit
of
killing
germans
he
also
had
a
curious
dislike
of
policemen
it
appears
to
me
i
said
politely
that
for
the
sake
of
your
health
the
other
end
of
the
street
is
better
than
the
agent
de
police
released
his
grip
from
the
australian
wrist
and
saluted
me
vous
avez
raison
monsieur
je
vous
remercie
ces
australiens
sont
vraiment
formidables
pas
he
disappeared
through
the
crowd
who
were
smiling
with
a
keen
sense
of
understanding
only
the
lady
of
the
estaminet
was
unappeased
they
are
bandits
these
australians
she
said
to
the
world
about
her
the
tall
australian
shook
hands
with
me
in
a
comradely
way
thanks
for
your
trouble
he
said
it
was
the
injustice
i
stick
i
always
pay
the
right
price
i
come
from
i
watched
him
go
slouching
down
the
rue
des
trois
cailloux
head
above
all
the
he
would
be
at
pozieres
again
next
day
vii
i
was
billeted
for
a
time
with
other
war
correspondents
in
an
old
house
in
the
rue
amiral
courbet
on
the
way
to
the
river
somme
from
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
and
with
a
view
of
the
spire
of
the
cathedral
a
wonderful
thing
of
delicate
lines
and
tracery
graven
with
love
in
every
line
by
muirhead
bone
and
from
my
dormer
window
it
was
the
house
of
mme
de
la
rochefoucauld
who
lived
farther
out
of
the
town
but
drove
in
now
and
then
to
look
at
this
little
mansion
of
hers
at
the
end
of
a
courtyard
behind
gates
it
was
built
in
the
days
before
the
revolution
when
it
was
dangerous
to
be
a
fine
lady
with
the
name
of
rochefoucauld
the
furniture
was
rather
scanty
and
was
of
the
louis
quinze
and
empire
periods
some
portraits
of
old
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
france
with
one
young
fellow
in
a
scarlet
coat
who
might
have
been
in
the
king
company
of
the
guard
about
the
time
when
wolfe
scaled
the
heights
of
abraham
summoned
up
the
ghosts
of
the
house
and
i
liked
to
think
of
them
in
these
rooms
and
going
in
their
across
the
little
courtyard
to
high
mass
at
the
cathedral
or
to
a
game
of
bezique
in
some
other
mansion
still
standing
in
the
quiet
streets
of
amiens
unless
in
a
day
in
march
of
they
were
destroyed
with
many
hundreds
of
houses
by
bombs
and
my
little
room
was
on
the
floor
below
the
garret
and
here
at
night
after
a
long
day
in
the
fields
up
by
pozieres
or
martinpuich
or
beyond
by
on
the
way
to
bapaume
in
the
long
struggle
and
slaughter
over
every
inch
of
ground
i
used
to
write
my
day
despatch
to
be
taken
next
day
it
was
before
we
were
allowed
to
use
the
military
wires
by
king
messenger
to
england
those
articles
written
at
high
speed
with
an
impressionism
born
out
of
many
new
memories
of
tragic
and
heroic
scenes
were
interrupted
sometimes
by
hostile
airmen
came
often
to
amiens
during
the
somme
fighting
to
unload
their
bombs
as
near
to
the
station
as
they
could
guess
which
was
not
often
very
near
generally
they
killed
a
few
women
and
children
and
knocked
a
few
poor
houses
and
a
shop
or
two
into
a
wild
rubbish
heap
of
bricks
and
timber
while
i
wrote
listening
to
the
crashing
of
glass
and
the
fire
of
french
guns
from
the
citadel
i
used
to
wonder
subconsciously
whether
i
should
suddenly
be
hurled
into
chaos
at
the
end
of
an
unfinished
sentence
and
now
and
again
in
spite
of
my
desperate
conflict
with
time
to
get
my
message
done
the
censors
were
waiting
for
it
downstairs
i
had
to
get
up
and
walk
into
the
passage
to
listen
to
the
infernal
noise
in
the
dark
city
of
amiens
but
i
went
back
again
and
bent
over
my
paper
concentrating
on
the
picture
of
war
which
i
was
trying
to
set
down
so
that
the
world
might
see
and
understand
until
once
again
ten
minutes
later
or
so
my
would
weaken
and
the
little
devil
of
fear
would
creep
up
to
my
heart
and
i
would
go
uneasily
to
the
door
again
to
listen
then
once
more
to
my
writing
nothing
touched
the
house
in
the
rue
amiral
courbet
while
we
were
there
but
it
was
into
my
bedroom
that
a
shell
went
crashing
after
that
night
in
march
when
amiens
was
badly
wrecked
and
we
listened
to
the
noise
of
destruction
all
around
us
from
a
room
in
the
hotel
du
rhin
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
i
should
have
been
sleeping
still
if
i
had
slept
that
night
in
my
little
old
bedroom
when
the
shell
paid
a
visit
there
were
no
lights
allowed
at
night
in
amiens
and
when
i
think
of
darkness
i
think
of
that
city
in
time
of
war
when
all
the
streets
were
black
tunnels
and
one
fumbled
one
way
timidly
if
one
had
no
between
the
old
houses
with
their
pointed
gables
coming
into
sharp
collision
sometimes
with
other
wayfarers
but
up
to
midnight
there
were
little
lights
flashing
for
a
second
and
then
going
out
along
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
and
in
the
dark
corners
of
they
were
carried
by
girls
seeking
to
entice
english
officers
on
their
way
to
their
billets
and
they
clustered
like
glowworms
about
the
side
door
of
the
hotel
du
rhin
after
nine
and
outside
the
railings
of
the
public
gardens
as
one
passed
the
bright
from
a
pocket
torch
flashed
in
one
eyes
and
in
the
radiance
of
it
one
saw
a
girl
face
laughing
coming
very
close
while
her
fingers
felt
for
one
badge
how
dark
it
is
little
captain
are
you
not
afraid
of
darkness
i
am
full
of
fear
it
is
so
sad
this
war
so
dismal
it
is
comradeship
that
helps
one
now
a
little
love
a
little
laughter
and
then
who
knows
a
little
love
a
little
laughter
alluring
words
to
boys
out
of
one
battle
expecting
another
hating
it
all
lonely
in
their
souls
because
of
the
thought
of
death
in
exile
from
their
own
folk
in
exile
from
all
womanhood
and
tender
feminine
things
up
there
in
the
ditches
and
shellcraters
of
the
desert
fields
or
in
the
huts
of
headquarters
staffs
or
in
reserve
camps
behind
the
a
little
love
a
little
laughter
and
then
who
knows
the
sirens
had
whispered
their
own
thoughts
they
had
translated
into
pretty
french
the
temptation
of
all
the
little
devils
in
their
souls
un
peu
one
was
enough
for
two
down
a
narrow
street
toward
the
riverside
and
then
up
a
little
dark
stairway
to
a
room
presently
this
poor
boy
would
be
stricken
with
disease
and
wish
himself
dead
viii
in
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
there
was
a
small
estaminet
into
which
i
went
one
morning
for
a
cup
of
coffee
while
i
read
an
amiens
made
up
mostly
of
extracts
translated
from
the
leading
articles
of
english
papers
there
was
never
any
news
of
french
fighting
beyond
the
official
communique
and
imaginary
articles
of
a
romantic
kind
written
by
french
journalists
in
paris
about
episodes
of
war
in
one
corner
of
the
estaminet
was
a
group
of
bourgeois
gentlemen
talking
business
for
a
time
and
then
listening
to
a
monologue
from
the
woman
behind
the
counter
i
could
not
catch
many
words
of
the
conversation
owing
to
the
general
chatter
but
when
the
man
went
out
the
woman
and
i
were
left
alone
together
and
she
came
over
to
me
and
put
a
photograph
down
on
the
table
before
me
and
as
though
carrying
on
her
previous
train
of
thought
said
in
french
of
course
yes
that
is
what
the
war
has
done
to
i
could
not
guess
her
meaning
looking
at
the
photograph
i
saw
it
was
of
a
young
girl
in
evening
dress
with
her
hair
coiled
in
an
artistic
way
and
a
little
curl
on
each
cheek
madame
daughter
i
thought
looking
up
at
the
woman
standing
in
front
of
me
in
a
grubby
bodice
and
tousled
hair
she
looked
a
woman
of
about
forty
with
a
wan
face
and
beaten
eyes
a
charming
young
lady
i
said
glancing
again
at
the
portrait
the
woman
repeated
her
last
sentence
word
for
word
yes
that
is
what
the
war
has
done
to
i
looked
up
at
her
again
and
saw
that
she
had
the
face
of
the
young
girl
in
the
photograph
but
coarsened
aged
raddled
by
the
passing
years
and
perhaps
by
tragedy
it
is
you
i
asked
yes
in
before
the
war
i
have
changed
since
then
pas
monsieur
there
is
a
change
i
said
i
tried
not
to
express
my
thought
of
how
much
change
you
have
suffered
in
the
war
more
than
most
people
ah
i
have
suffered
she
told
me
her
story
and
word
for
word
if
i
could
have
written
it
down
then
it
would
have
read
like
a
little
novel
by
guy
de
maupassant
she
was
the
daughter
of
people
in
lille
merchants
and
before
the
war
married
a
young
man
of
the
same
town
the
son
of
other
manufacturers
they
had
two
children
and
were
very
happy
then
the
war
came
the
enemy
drove
down
through
belgium
and
one
day
drew
near
and
threatened
lille
the
parents
of
the
young
couple
said
we
will
stay
we
are
too
old
to
leave
our
home
and
it
is
better
to
keep
watch
over
the
factory
you
must
go
with
the
little
ones
and
there
is
no
time
to
there
was
no
time
to
lose
the
trains
were
crowded
with
fugitives
and
soldiers
mostly
soldiers
it
was
necessary
to
walk
weeping
the
young
husband
and
wife
said
farewell
to
their
parents
and
set
out
on
the
long
trail
with
the
two
babies
in
a
perambulator
under
a
load
of
bread
and
wine
and
a
little
maid
carrying
some
clothes
in
a
bundle
for
days
they
tramped
the
roads
until
they
were
all
dusty
and
bedraggled
and
footsore
but
glad
to
be
getting
farther
away
from
that
tide
of
men
which
had
now
swamped
over
lille
the
young
husband
comforted
his
wife
courage
he
said
i
have
money
enough
to
carry
us
through
the
war
we
will
set
up
a
little
shop
the
maid
wept
bitterly
now
and
then
but
the
young
husband
said
we
will
take
care
of
you
margot
there
is
nothing
to
fear
we
are
lucky
in
our
he
was
a
delicate
fellow
rejected
for
military
service
but
brave
they
came
to
amiens
and
hired
the
estaminet
and
set
up
business
there
was
a
heavy
debt
to
work
off
for
capital
and
expenses
before
they
would
make
money
but
they
were
doing
well
the
mother
was
happy
with
her
children
and
the
little
maid
had
dried
her
tears
then
one
day
the
young
husband
went
away
with
the
little
maid
and
all
the
money
leaving
his
wife
in
the
estaminet
with
a
big
debt
to
pay
and
a
broken
heart
that
is
what
the
war
has
done
to
me
she
said
again
picking
up
the
photograph
of
the
girl
in
the
evening
frock
with
a
little
curl
on
each
cheek
triste
madame
oui
triste
monsieur
but
it
was
not
war
that
had
caused
her
tragedy
except
that
it
had
unloosened
the
roots
of
her
family
life
guy
de
maupassant
would
have
given
just
such
an
ending
to
his
story
ix
some
of
our
officers
stationed
in
amiens
and
billeted
in
private
houses
became
very
friendly
with
the
families
who
received
them
young
girls
of
good
middle
class
the
daughters
of
shopkeepers
and
schoolmasters
and
merchants
in
a
good
way
of
business
found
it
delightful
to
wait
on
handsome
young
englishmen
to
teach
them
french
to
take
walks
with
them
and
to
arrange
musical
evenings
with
other
girl
friends
who
brought
their
young
officers
and
sang
little
old
french
songs
with
them
or
english
songs
in
the
prettiest
french
accent
these
young
officers
of
ours
found
the
home
life
very
charming
it
broke
the
monotony
of
exile
and
made
them
forget
the
evil
side
of
war
they
paid
little
gallantries
to
the
girls
bought
them
boxes
of
chocolate
until
fancy
chocolate
was
forbidden
in
france
and
presented
flowers
to
decorate
the
table
and
wrote
amusing
verses
in
their
autograph
albums
or
drew
sketches
for
them
as
this
went
on
they
gained
to
the
privilege
of
brotherhood
and
there
were
kisses
before
saying
good
night
outside
bedroom
doors
while
the
parents
downstairs
were
not
too
watchful
knowing
the
ways
of
young
people
and
lenient
because
of
their
happiness
then
a
day
came
in
each
one
of
these
households
when
the
officer
billeted
there
was
ordered
away
to
some
other
place
what
tears
what
lamentations
and
what
promises
never
to
forget
little
jeanne
with
her
dark
tresses
or
suzanne
with
the
merry
eyes
were
they
not
engaged
not
formally
perhaps
but
in
honor
and
in
love
for
a
time
letters
arrived
eagerly
waited
for
by
girls
with
aching
hearts
then
picture
with
a
line
or
two
of
affectionate
greeting
then
nothing
nothing
at
all
month
after
month
in
spite
of
all
the
letters
addressed
with
all
the
queer
initials
for
military
units
so
it
happened
again
and
again
until
bitterness
crept
into
girls
hearts
and
hardness
and
contempt
in
my
own
little
circle
of
friends
said
a
lady
of
amiens
i
know
eighteen
girls
who
were
engaged
to
english
officers
and
have
been
forsaken
it
is
not
fair
it
is
not
good
your
english
young
men
seem
so
serious
far
more
serious
than
our
french
boys
they
have
a
look
of
shyness
which
we
find
delightful
they
are
timid
at
first
and
blush
when
one
pays
a
pretty
compliment
they
are
a
long
time
before
they
take
liberties
so
we
trust
them
and
take
them
seriously
and
allow
intimacies
which
we
should
refuse
to
french
boys
unless
formally
engaged
but
it
is
all
camouflage
at
heart
your
english
young
men
are
just
flirts
they
play
with
us
make
fools
of
us
steal
our
hearts
and
then
go
away
and
often
do
not
send
so
much
as
a
not
even
one
little
to
the
girls
who
weep
their
hearts
out
for
them
you
english
are
all
hypocrites
you
boast
that
you
the
game
i
know
your
phrase
it
is
untrue
you
play
with
good
girls
as
though
they
were
grues
and
that
no
frenchman
would
dare
to
do
he
knows
the
difference
between
good
girls
and
bad
girls
and
behaves
with
reverence
to
those
who
are
good
when
the
english
army
goes
away
from
france
it
will
leave
many
bitter
memories
because
of
x
it
was
my
habit
to
go
out
at
night
for
a
walk
through
amiens
before
going
to
bed
and
generally
turned
for
even
on
moonless
nights
there
was
always
a
luminance
over
the
water
and
one
could
see
to
walk
along
the
quayside
northward
and
eastward
the
sky
was
quivering
with
flashes
of
white
light
like
summer
lightning
and
now
and
then
there
was
a
long
vivid
glare
of
red
touching
the
high
clouds
with
rosy
feathers
one
of
our
dumps
or
one
of
the
enemy
had
been
blown
up
by
that
sullen
and
menacing
which
never
ceased
for
years
in
that
quiet
alone
or
with
some
comrade
like
frederic
palmer
or
beach
thomas
as
tired
and
as
thoughtful
as
oneself
after
a
long
day
journeying
in
the
swirl
of
war
one
brain
roved
over
the
scenes
of
battle
visualizing
anew
and
in
imagination
the
agony
up
there
the
death
which
was
being
done
by
those
guns
and
the
stupendous
sum
of
all
this
conflict
we
saw
after
all
only
one
patch
of
the
battlefields
of
the
world
and
yet
were
staggered
by
the
immensity
of
its
massacre
by
the
endless
streams
of
wounded
and
by
the
growth
of
those
little
forests
of
white
crosses
behind
the
we
knew
and
could
see
at
any
moment
in
the
mind
eye
even
in
the
darkness
of
an
amiens
night
the
vastness
of
the
human
energy
which
was
in
motion
along
all
the
roads
to
paris
and
from
boulogne
and
dieppe
and
havre
to
the
and
in
every
village
on
the
way
the
long
columns
of
bringing
up
food
and
ammunition
the
trains
on
their
way
to
the
army
with
material
of
war
and
more
food
and
more
shells
the
red
cross
trains
crowded
with
maimed
and
injured
boys
the
ambulances
clearing
the
casualty
stations
the
troops
marching
forward
from
back
roads
to
the
front
from
which
many
would
never
come
marching
back
the
guns
and
limbers
and
military
transports
and
spare
horses
along
hundreds
of
miles
of
roads
all
the
machinery
of
slaughter
on
the
move
it
was
staggering
in
its
enormity
in
its
detail
and
in
its
activity
yet
beyond
our
sphere
in
the
british
section
of
the
western
front
there
was
the
french
front
larger
than
ours
stretching
right
through
france
and
all
their
roads
were
crowded
with
the
same
traffic
and
all
their
towns
and
villages
were
stirred
by
the
same
activity
and
for
the
same
purpose
of
death
and
all
their
hospitals
were
crammed
with
the
wreckage
of
youth
on
the
other
side
of
the
lines
the
germans
were
busy
in
the
same
way
as
busy
as
soldier
ants
and
the
roads
behind
their
front
were
cumbered
by
endless
columns
of
transport
and
marching
men
and
guns
and
ambulances
laden
with
bashed
blinded
and
bleeding
boys
so
it
was
in
italy
in
austria
in
saloniki
and
bulgaria
serbia
mesopotamia
egypt
in
the
silence
of
amiens
by
night
under
the
stars
with
a
cool
breath
of
the
night
air
on
our
foreheads
with
a
glamour
of
light
over
the
waters
of
the
somme
our
spirit
was
stricken
by
the
thought
of
this
and
cried
out
in
anguish
against
this
bloody
crime
in
which
all
humanity
was
involved
the
senselessness
of
it
the
futility
the
waste
the
mockery
of
men
faith
in
god
often
palmer
and
i
dear
grave
old
palmer
with
face
and
honest
soul
used
to
trudge
along
silently
with
just
a
sigh
now
and
then
or
a
groan
or
a
sudden
cry
of
o
god
o
christ
it
was
i
generally
who
spoke
those
words
and
palmer
would
say
yes
and
going
to
last
a
long
time
yet
a
long
time
it
a
question
who
will
hold
out
hours
longer
than
the
other
side
france
is
tired
more
tired
than
any
of
us
will
she
break
first
somehow
i
think
not
they
are
wonderful
their
women
have
a
gallant
spirit
how
good
it
is
the
smell
of
the
trees
sometimes
we
would
cross
the
river
and
look
back
at
the
cathedral
high
and
beautiful
above
the
huddle
of
old
old
houses
on
the
quayside
with
a
faint
light
on
its
pinnacle
and
buttresses
and
immense
blackness
beyond
them
those
builders
of
france
loved
their
work
said
palmer
there
was
always
war
about
the
walls
of
this
cathedral
but
they
went
on
with
it
stone
by
stone
without
we
stood
there
in
a
long
silence
not
on
one
night
only
but
many
times
and
out
of
those
little
dark
streets
below
the
cathedral
of
amiens
came
the
spirit
of
history
to
teach
our
spirit
with
wonderment
at
the
nobility
and
the
brutality
of
men
and
their
incurable
folly
and
their
patience
with
tyranny
when
is
it
all
going
to
end
palmer
old
man
the
war
or
the
folly
of
men
the
war
this
cursed
war
this
bloody
something
will
break
one
day
on
our
side
or
the
other
those
who
hold
out
longest
and
have
the
best
reserves
of
we
were
starting
early
next
day
before
dawn
to
see
the
beginning
of
another
battle
we
walked
slowly
over
the
little
iron
bridge
again
through
the
vegetable
market
where
old
men
and
women
were
unloading
cabbages
from
a
big
wagon
then
into
the
dark
tunnel
of
the
rue
des
augustins
and
so
to
the
little
old
mansion
of
mme
de
la
rochefoucauld
in
the
rue
amiral
courbet
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
window
of
the
censor
room
in
there
the
colonel
was
reading
the
times
in
the
louis
quinze
salon
with
a
grave
pucker
on
his
high
thin
forehead
he
could
not
get
any
grasp
of
the
world
events
there
was
an
attack
on
the
censor
by
northcliffe
now
what
did
he
mean
by
that
it
was
really
very
unkind
of
him
after
so
much
civility
to
him
charteris
would
be
furious
he
would
bang
the
telephone
but
dear
dear
why
should
people
be
so
violent
war
correspondents
were
violent
on
the
slightest
provocation
the
world
itself
was
very
violent
and
it
was
all
so
dangerous
do
you
think
so
russell
the
cars
were
ordered
for
five
time
for
bed
xi
the
night
in
amiens
was
dark
and
sinister
when
rain
fell
heavily
out
of
a
moonless
sky
hardly
a
flashed
out
except
where
a
solitary
woman
scurried
down
the
wet
streets
to
lonely
rooms
there
were
no
british
officers
strolling
about
they
had
turned
in
early
to
hot
baths
and
unaccustomed
beds
except
for
one
or
two
with
their
burberries
buttoned
tight
at
the
throat
and
sopping
pulled
down
about
the
ears
and
top
boots
which
went
splash
splash
through
deep
puddles
as
they
staggered
a
little
uncertainly
and
peered
up
at
dark
corners
to
find
their
whereabouts
by
a
dim
sense
of
locality
and
the
shapes
of
the
houses
the
rain
pattered
sharply
on
the
pavements
and
beat
a
tattoo
on
leaden
gutters
and
slate
roofs
every
window
was
shuttered
and
no
light
gleamed
through
on
such
a
night
i
went
out
with
beach
thomas
as
often
before
wet
or
fine
after
hard
writing
a
foul
night
said
thomas
setting
off
in
his
quick
jerky
step
i
like
to
feel
the
rain
on
my
we
turned
down
as
usual
to
the
river
it
was
very
dark
the
rain
was
heavy
on
the
quayside
where
there
was
a
group
of
people
bareheaded
in
the
rain
and
chattering
in
french
with
gusts
of
laughter
une
bouteille
de
champagne
the
words
were
spoken
in
a
clear
voice
with
an
elaborate
caricature
of
french
accent
in
musical
cadence
but
unmistakably
english
a
drunken
officer
said
thomas
poor
devil
we
drew
near
among
the
people
and
saw
a
young
officer
arm
in
arm
with
a
french
peasant
one
of
the
market
porters
telling
a
tale
in
broken
french
to
the
audience
about
him
with
comic
gesticulations
and
extraordinary
volubility
a
woman
put
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
spoke
in
french
he
has
drunk
too
much
bad
wine
his
legs
walk
away
from
him
he
will
be
in
trouble
monsieur
and
a
child
no
older
than
my
own
boy
who
is
fighting
in
the
une
bouteille
de
champagne
vite
said
the
young
officer
then
he
waved
his
arm
and
said
perdu
mon
cheval
a
kingdom
for
a
bloody
horse
as
shakespeare
said
y
qui
a
vu
mon
sacre
cheval
in
other
words
if
i
do
find
that
beast
which
led
to
my
damnation
i
shall
be
shot
at
dawn
fusille
comprenez
on
va
me
fusiller
par
un
mur
blanc
or
is
it
une
mure
blanche
quand
se
leve
avec
les
couleurs
rose
et
jeune
fille
lavee
et
parfumee
pretty
good
that
eh
what
but
the
fact
remains
that
unless
i
find
my
steed
my
charger
my
which
in
reality
does
not
belong
to
me
at
all
because
i
pinched
it
from
the
colonel
i
shall
be
shot
as
sure
as
fate
and
alas
i
do
not
want
to
die
i
am
too
young
to
die
and
meanwhile
i
desire
encore
une
bouteille
de
champagne
the
little
crowd
of
citizens
found
a
grim
humor
in
this
speech
of
which
they
understood
they
laughed
coarsely
and
a
man
said
quel
drole
de
type
quel
numero
but
the
woman
who
had
touched
me
on
the
sleeve
spoke
to
me
again
he
says
he
has
lost
his
horse
and
will
be
shot
as
a
deserter
those
things
happen
my
boy
in
the
argonne
tells
me
that
a
comrade
of
his
was
shot
for
hiding
five
days
with
his
young
woman
it
would
be
sad
if
this
poor
child
should
be
condemned
to
i
pushed
my
way
through
the
crowd
and
went
up
to
the
officer
can
i
help
at
all
he
greeted
me
warmly
as
though
he
had
known
me
for
years
my
dear
old
pal
you
can
indeed
first
of
all
i
want
a
bottle
of
bouteille
de
it
was
wonderful
how
much
music
he
put
into
those
words
and
after
that
i
want
my
runaway
horse
as
i
have
explained
to
these
good
people
who
do
not
understand
a
bloody
word
in
spite
of
my
excellent
french
accent
i
stole
the
colonel
horse
to
come
for
a
to
amiens
the
colonel
is
one
of
the
best
of
men
but
very
touchy
very
touchy
indeed
you
would
be
surprised
he
also
has
the
worst
horse
in
the
world
or
did
until
it
ran
away
half
an
hour
ago
into
the
blackness
of
this
hell
which
men
call
amiens
it
is
quite
certain
that
if
i
go
back
without
that
horse
most
unpleasant
things
will
happen
to
a
gallant
young
british
officer
meaning
myself
who
with
most
innocent
intentions
of
cleansing
his
soul
from
the
filth
of
battle
from
the
horror
of
battle
from
the
disgusting
fear
of
battle
oh
yes
been
afraid
all
right
and
so
have
you
unless
you
a
damned
hero
or
a
damned
liar
desired
to
get
as
far
as
this
beautiful
city
so
fair
without
so
foul
within
in
order
to
drink
a
bottle
or
even
two
or
three
of
rich
sparkling
wine
to
see
the
loveliness
of
women
as
they
trip
about
these
pestilential
streets
to
say
a
little
prayer
in
la
cathedrale
and
then
to
ride
back
refreshed
virtuous
knightly
all
through
the
quiet
night
to
deliver
up
the
horse
whence
i
had
pinched
it
and
nobody
any
the
wiser
in
the
dewy
morn
you
see
it
was
a
good
what
happened
i
asked
it
happened
thuswise
he
answered
breaking
out
into
fresh
eloquence
with
fantastic
similes
and
expressions
of
which
i
can
give
only
the
spirit
leaving
a
pozieres
which
as
you
doubtless
know
unless
you
are
a
bloody
is
a
place
where
the
devil
goes
about
like
a
roaring
lion
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
where
he
leaves
his
entrails
hanging
on
to
barbed
wire
and
where
the
bodies
of
your
friends
and
mine
lie
decomposing
in
muddy
holes
you
know
the
place
i
put
my
legs
across
the
colonel
horse
which
was
in
the
wagonlines
and
set
forth
for
amiens
that
horse
knew
that
i
had
pinched
him
forgive
my
slang
i
should
have
said
it
in
the
french
language
vole
and
resented
me
thrice
was
i
nearly
thrown
from
his
back
twice
did
he
entangle
himself
in
barbed
wire
deliberately
once
did
i
have
to
coerce
him
with
many
stripes
to
pass
a
tank
then
the
heavens
opened
upon
us
and
it
rained
it
rained
until
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
in
spite
of
sheltering
beneath
a
tree
one
branch
of
which
owing
to
the
stubborn
temper
of
my
steed
struck
me
a
stinging
blow
across
the
face
so
in
no
joyful
spirit
i
came
at
last
to
amiens
this
whited
sepulcher
this
circe
capital
this
den
of
thieves
this
home
of
vampires
there
i
dined
not
wisely
but
too
well
i
drank
of
the
flowing
cup
une
bouteille
de
champagne
and
i
met
a
maiden
as
ugly
as
sin
but
beautiful
in
my
eyes
after
pozieres
you
understand
and
accompanied
her
to
her
poor
lodging
in
a
most
verminous
place
sir
where
we
discoursed
upon
the
problems
of
life
and
love
o
youth
o
war
o
hell
my
horse
that
brute
who
resented
me
was
in
charge
of
an
whom
i
believe
verily
is
a
limb
of
satan
in
the
yard
without
it
was
late
when
i
left
that
lair
of
circe
where
young
british
officers
even
as
myself
are
turned
into
swine
it
was
late
and
dark
and
i
was
drunk
even
now
i
am
very
drunk
i
may
say
that
i
am
becoming
drunker
and
it
was
true
the
fumes
of
bad
champagne
were
working
in
the
boy
brain
and
he
leaned
heavily
against
me
it
was
then
that
that
happened
which
will
undoubtedly
lead
to
my
undoing
and
blast
my
career
as
i
have
blasted
my
soul
the
horse
was
there
in
the
yard
but
without
saddle
or
bridle
is
my
saddle
and
where
is
my
bridle
oh
naughty
i
shouted
in
dismay
the
who
as
i
informed
you
is
one
of
satan
imps
answered
in
incomprehensible
french
led
the
horse
forth
from
the
yard
and
giving
it
a
mighty
blow
on
the
rump
sent
it
clattering
forth
into
the
outer
darkness
in
my
fear
of
losing
it
for
i
must
be
at
pozieres
at
dawn
i
ran
after
it
but
it
ran
too
fast
in
the
darkness
and
i
stopped
and
tried
to
grope
my
way
back
to
the
stableyard
to
kill
that
thereby
serving
god
and
other
british
officers
for
he
was
the
agent
but
i
could
not
find
the
yard
again
it
had
disappeared
it
was
swallowed
up
in
cimmerian
gloom
so
i
was
without
revenge
and
without
horse
and
as
you
will
perceive
sir
unless
you
are
a
bloody
who
does
perceive
anything
i
am
utterly
undone
i
am
also
horribly
drunk
and
i
must
apologize
for
leaning
so
heavily
on
your
arm
it
awfully
good
of
you
anyway
old
the
crowd
was
mostly
moving
driven
indoors
by
the
rain
the
woman
who
had
spoken
to
me
said
i
heard
a
horse
hoofs
upon
the
bridge
then
she
went
away
with
her
apron
over
her
head
thomas
and
i
walked
each
side
of
the
officer
giving
him
an
arm
he
could
not
walk
straight
and
his
legs
played
freakish
tricks
with
him
all
the
while
he
talked
in
a
strain
of
high
comedy
interlarded
with
grim
little
phrases
revealing
an
underlying
sense
of
tragedy
and
despair
until
his
speech
thickened
and
he
became
less
fluent
we
spent
a
fantastic
hour
searching
for
his
horse
it
was
like
a
nightmare
in
the
darkness
and
rain
every
now
and
then
we
heard
distinctly
the
of
a
horse
hoofs
and
went
off
in
that
direction
only
to
be
baffled
by
dead
silence
with
no
sign
of
the
animal
then
again
as
we
stood
listening
we
heard
the
beat
of
hoofs
on
hard
pavements
in
the
opposite
direction
and
walked
that
way
dragging
the
boy
who
was
getting
more
and
more
incapable
of
walking
upright
at
last
we
gave
up
hope
of
finding
the
horse
though
the
young
officer
kept
assuring
us
that
he
must
find
it
at
all
costs
it
a
point
of
honor
he
said
thickly
not
my
horse
you
know
doctor
horse
devil
to
pay
he
laughed
foolishly
and
said
always
devil
to
pay
in
we
were
soaked
to
the
skin
come
home
with
me
i
said
we
can
give
you
a
frightfully
good
old
man
awfully
sorry
you
know
and
all
that
are
you
a
blooming
general
or
something
but
i
must
find
by
some
means
we
succeeded
in
persuading
him
that
the
chase
was
useless
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
get
into
our
billet
and
start
out
next
morning
early
we
dragged
him
up
the
rue
des
augustins
to
the
rue
amiral
courbet
outside
the
iron
gates
i
spoke
to
him
warningly
you
got
to
be
quiet
there
are
inside
what
staff
officers
oh
my
god
the
boy
was
dismayed
the
thought
of
facing
almost
sobered
him
did
indeed
sober
his
brain
for
a
moment
though
not
his
legs
it
all
right
i
said
go
quietly
and
i
will
get
you
upstairs
it
was
astonishing
how
quietly
he
went
hanging
on
to
me
the
little
colonel
was
reading
the
times
in
the
salon
we
passed
the
open
door
and
saw
over
the
paper
his
high
forehead
puckered
with
perplexity
as
to
the
ways
of
the
world
but
he
did
not
raise
his
head
or
drop
the
times
at
the
sound
of
our
entry
i
took
the
boy
upstairs
to
my
room
and
guided
him
inside
he
said
thanks
awfully
and
then
lay
down
on
the
floor
and
fell
into
so
deep
a
sleep
that
i
was
scared
and
thought
for
a
moment
he
might
be
dead
i
went
downstairs
to
chat
with
the
little
colonel
and
form
an
alibi
in
case
of
trouble
an
hour
later
when
i
went
into
my
room
i
found
the
boy
still
lying
as
i
had
left
him
without
having
stirred
a
limb
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
with
his
head
hanging
limply
across
his
right
arm
and
a
lock
of
damp
hair
falling
across
his
forehead
i
thought
of
a
son
of
mine
who
in
a
few
years
would
be
as
old
as
he
and
i
prayed
god
mine
might
be
spared
this
boy
tragedy
through
the
night
he
slept
in
a
drugged
way
but
just
at
dawn
he
woke
up
and
stretched
himself
with
a
queer
little
moan
then
he
sat
up
and
said
where
am
i
in
a
billet
at
amiens
you
lost
your
horse
last
night
and
i
brought
you
remembrance
came
into
his
eyes
and
his
face
was
swept
with
a
sudden
flush
of
shame
and
agony
yes
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
the
worst
possible
how
can
i
get
back
to
pozieres
you
could
jump
a
lorry
with
i
must
it
serious
if
i
do
get
back
in
time
in
any
case
the
loss
of
that
horse
he
thought
deeply
for
a
moment
and
i
could
see
that
his
head
was
aching
to
the
beat
of
can
i
wash
anywhere
i
pointed
to
a
jug
and
basin
and
he
said
thanks
he
washed
hurriedly
and
then
stared
down
with
a
shamed
look
at
his
muddy
uniform
all
creased
and
bedraggled
after
that
he
asked
if
he
could
get
out
downstairs
and
i
told
him
the
door
was
unlocked
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
leaving
my
room
i
am
sorry
to
have
given
you
all
this
trouble
it
was
very
decent
of
you
many
the
boy
was
a
gentleman
when
sober
i
wonder
if
he
died
at
pozieres
or
farther
on
by
the
butte
de
warlencourt
a
week
later
i
saw
an
advertisement
in
an
amiens
paper

it
was
the
horse
for
which
we
had
searched
in

rain
xii
the
quickest
way
to
the
cathedral
is
down
a
turning
on
the
side
of
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
charlie
bar
was
on
the
side
of
the
street
always
crowded
after
six
by
officers
of
every
regiment
drinking
martinis
bronxes
sherry
cobblers
and
other
liquids
which
helped
men
marvelously
to
forget
the
beastliness
of
war
and
gave
them
the
gift
of
laughter
and
made
them
careless
of
the
battles
which
would
have
to
be
fought
young
were
there
explaining
carefully
how
hard
worked
they
were
and
how
often
they
went
under
the
fighting
officers
english
scottish
irish
welsh
jeered
at
them
laughed
hugely
at
the
latest
story
of
mirthful
horror
arranged
rendezvous
at
the
godebert
restaurant
where
they
would
see
the
beautiful
marguerite
until
she
transferred
to
la
cathedrale
in
the
same
street
and
our
checks
which
charlie
cashed
at
a
discount
with
a
noble
faith
in
british
honesty
not
often
as
he
told
me
being
hurt
by
a
charlie
bar
was
wrecked
by
afterward
and
he
went
to
abbeville
and
set
up
a
more
important
establishment
which
was
wrecked
too
in
a
fierce
air
raid
before
the
paint
was
dry
on
the
walls
the
cathedral
was
a
shrine
to
which
many
men
and
women
went
all
through
the
war
called
into
its
white
halls
by
the
spirit
of
beauty
which
dwelt
there
and
by
its
silence
and
peace
the
great
west
door
was
screened
from
by
piled
high
and
inside
there
were
other
walls
of
closing
in
the
sanctuary
and
some
of
the
windows
but
these
signs
of
war
did
not
spoil
the
majesty
of
the
tall
columns
and
high
roof
nor
the
loveliness
of
the
sculptured
flowers
below
the
clerestory
arches
nor
the
spiritual
mystery
of
those
great
dim
aisles
where
light
flickered
and
shadows
lurked
and
the
ghosts
of
history
came
out
of
their
tombs
to
pace
these
stones
again
where
five
six
seven
centuries
before
they
had
walked
to
worship
god
in
joy
or
in
despair
or
to
show
their
beauty
of
young
womanhood
peasant
girl
or
princess
to
lovers
gazing
by
the
pillars
or
to
plight
their
troth
as
royal
brides
or
get
a
crown
for
their
heads
or
mercy
for
their
dead
bodies
in
coffins
our
soldiers
went
in
there
as
many
centuries
before
other
english
soldiers
who
came
out
with
edward
the
black
prince
by
way
of
crecy
or
with
harry
the
king
through
agincourt
five
hundred
years
hence
if
amiens
cathedral
still
stands
undamaged
by
some
new
and
monstrous
conflict
in
a
world
of
incurable
folly
the
generation
of
that
time
will
think
now
and
then
perhaps
of
the
english
lads
in
khaki
who
tramped
up
the
highway
of
this
nave
with
their
under
their
arms
each
footstep
leaving
the
imprint
of
a
wet
boot
on
the
old
flagstones
awed
by
the
silence
and
the
spaciousness
with
a
sudden
heartache
for
a
closer
knowledge
or
some
knowledge
of
the
god
worshiped
there
the
god
of
love
while
not
far
away
men
were
killing
one
another
by
high
explosives
shells
mines
bayonets
tanks
and
in
close
fighting
with
short
daggers
like
butchers
knives
or
clubs
with
steel
knobs
i
watched
the
faces
of
the
men
who
entered
here
some
of
them
like
the
australians
and
unfamiliar
with
cathedrals
and
not
religious
by
instinct
or
training
wandered
round
in
a
wondering
way
with
a
touch
of
scorn
even
of
hostility
now
and
then
for
these
mysteries
the
chanting
of
the
office
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
at
the
high
mass
which
were
beyond
their
understanding
and
which
they
could
not
link
up
with
any
logic
of
life
as
they
knew
it
now
away
up
by
bapaume
or
bullecourt
where
god
had
nothing
to
do
seemingly
with
a
night
raid
into
boche
lines
when
they
blew
a
party
of
germans
to
bits
by
dropping
stoke
bombs
down
their
dugout
or
with
the
shrieks
of
german
boys
mad
with
fear
when
the
australians
jumped
on
them
in
the
darkness
and
made
haste
with
their
killing
all
the
same
this
great
church
was
wonderful
and
the
australians
scrunching
their
stared
up
at
the
tall
columns
to
the
clerestory
arches
and
peered
through
the
screen
to
the
golden
sun
upon
the
and
touched
old
tombs
with
their
muddy
hands
reading
the
dates
on
them
with
astonishment
at
their
antiquity
their
hatchet
faces
sun
baked
tanned
by
rain
and
wind
their
simple
eyes
the
fine
strong
grace
of
their
bodies
as
they
stood
at
ease
in
this
place
of
history
struck
me
as
being
wonderfully
like
all
that
one
imagines
of
those
english
knights
and
squires
who
rode
through
france
with
the
black
prince
it
is
as
though
australia
had
bred
back
to
the
old
strain
our
own
english
soldiers
were
less
arresting
to
the
eye
more
dapper
and
neat
not
such
evident
children
of
nature
gravely
they
walked
up
the
aisles
standing
in
groups
where
a
service
was
in
progress
watching
the
movements
of
the
priests
listening
to
the
choir
and
organ
with
reverent
dreamy
eyes
some
of
them
country
lads
thought
back
i
fancy
to
some
village
church
in
england
where
they
had
sung
hymns
with
mother
and
sisters
in
the
days
before
the
war
england
and
that
little
church
were
a
long
way
off
now
perhaps
all
eternity
away
i
saw
one
boy
standing
quite
motionless
with
wet
eyes
without
this
music
this
place
of
thoughtfulness
had
made
something
break
in
his
heart
some
of
our
young
officers
but
not
many
knelt
on
the
cane
chairs
and
prayed
face
in
hands
french
officers
crossed
themselves
and
their
medals
tinkled
as
they
walked
up
the
aisles
always
there
were
women
in
black
weeds
kneeling
before
the
side
altars
praying
to
the
virgin
for
husbands
and
sons
dead
or
alive
lighting
candles
below
holy
pictures
and
statues
our
men
tiptoed
past
them
holding
steel
hats
or
field
caps
and
putting
their
packs
against
the
pillars
on
the
steps
of
the
cathedral
i
heard
two
officers
talking
one
day
how
can
one
reconcile
all
this
with
the
war
why
not
i
suppose
we
fighting
for
justice
and
all
that
what
the
daily
mail
tells
seriously
old
man
where
does
christ
come
in
he
was
against
righteous
force
he
chased
the
out
of
the
yes
but
his
whole
teaching
was
love
and
forgiveness
shalt
not
kill
children
love
one
another
the
other
is
it
all
sheer
tosh
if
so
why
go
on
pretending
take
chaplains
in
khaki
these
with
black
crosses
they
make
me
sick
it
either
one
thing
or
the
other
brute
force
or
christianity
i
am
harking
back
to
the
brute
force
theory
but
i
not
going
to
say
is
love
one
day
and
then
prod
a
man
in
the
stomach
the
next
let
be
the
other
fellows
asked
for
it
they
attacked
yes
but
we
are
all
involved
our
diplomacy
our
secret
treaties
our
philosophical
dope
over
the
masses
our
imperial
egotism
our
trade
rivalries
all
that
was
a
direct
challenge
of
might
against
right
the
germans
are
more
efficient
and
more
logical
that
all
they
prepared
for
the
inevitable
and
struck
first
we
knew
the
inevitable
was
coming
but
did
prepare
being
too
damned
inefficient
i
have
a
leaning
toward
religion
instinctively
i
for
christ
but
it
does
work
in
with
efficiency
and
it
belongs
to
another
department
that
all
we
spiritual
and
animal
at
the
same
time
in
one
part
of
my
brain
i
a
gentleman
in
another
a
beast
it
conflict
we
ca
eliminate
the
beast
but
we
can
control
it
now
and
then
when
it
gets
too
obstreperous
and
where
religion
helps
it
the
high
ideal
the
germans
pray
to
the
same
god
praise
christ
and
ask
for
let
them
it
may
do
them
a
bit
of
good
it
seems
to
me
god
is
above
all
the
squabbles
of
humanity
does
care
a
damn
about
them
but
the
human
soul
can
get
into
touch
with
the
infinite
and
the
ideal
even
while
he
is
doing
butcher
work
and
beastliness
that
does
matter
very
much
it
part
of
the
routine
of
but
it
does
matter
it
makes
agony
and
damnation
in
the
world
it
creates
cruelty
and
tyranny
and
all
bloody
things
surely
if
we
believe
in
god
anyhow
in
christian
ethics
this
war
is
a
monstrous
crime
in
which
all
humanity
is
the
hun
started
it
let
go
and
give
the
glad
eye
to
at
night
in
moonlight
amiens
cathedral
was
touched
with
a
new
spirituality
a
white
magic
beyond
all
words
of
beauty
on
many
nights
of
war
i
walked
round
the
cathedral
square
looking
up
at
that
grand
mass
of
masonry
with
all
its
pinnacles
and
buttresses
gleaming
like
silver
and
its
sculptured
tracery
like
lacework
and
a
flood
of
milky
light
glamorous
on
walls
in
which
every
stone
was
beyond
a
vast
how
old
it
was
how
many
human
eyes
through
many
centuries
had
come
in
the
white
light
of
the
moon
to
look
at
this
dream
in
stone
enshrining
the
faith
of
men
the
revolution
had
surged
round
these
walls
and
the
screams
of
wild
women
and
their
shrill
laughter
and
their
cries
for
the
blood
of
aristocrats
had
risen
from
this
square
pageants
of
kingship
and
royal
death
had
passed
across
these
pavements
through
the
great
doors
there
peasant
women
in
the
darkness
had
wept
against
these
walls
praying
for
god
pity
for
their
hearts
now
the
english
officers
were
lighting
cigarettes
in
the
shelter
of
a
wall
the
outline
of
their
features
knightly
faces
touched
by
the
moonlight
there
were
flashes
of
in
the
sky
beyond
the
river
a
good
night
for
a
german
air
raid
said
one
of
the
officers
yes
a
lovely
night
for
killing
women
in
their
sleep
said
the
other
man
the
people
of
amiens
were
sleeping
and
no
light
gleamed
through
their
shutters
xiii
coming
away
from
the
cathedral
through
a
going
into
the
rue
des
trois
cailloux
i
used
to
pass
the
palais
de
justice
a
big
grim
building
with
a
long
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
its
doorways
and
above
the
portico
the
figure
of
justice
blind
holding
her
scales
there
was
no
justice
there
during
the
war
but
rooms
full
of
french
soldiers
with
smashed
faces
blind
many
of
them
like
that
woman
in
stone
they
used
to
sit
on
fine
days
on
the
flight
of
steps
a
tragic
exhibition
of
war
for
to
see
many
of
them
revealed
no
faces
but
were
white
masks
of
bandaged
round
their
heads
others
showed
only
the
upper
parts
of
their
faces
and
the
places
where
their
jaws
had
been
were
tied
up
with
white
rags
there
were
men
without
noses
and
men
with
half
their
scalps
torn
away
french
children
used
to
stare
through
the
railings
at
them
gravely
with
childish
curiosity
without
pity
english
soldiers
gave
them
a
passing
glance
and
went
on
to
places
where
they
might
be
made
like
this
without
faces
or
jaws
or
noses
or
eyes
by
their
uniforms
i
saw
that
there
were
chasseurs
alpins
and
chasseurs
and
young
infantrymen
of
the
line
and
gunners
they
sat
without
restlessness
watching
the
if
they
had
eyes
to
see
or
if
blind
feeling
the
breeze
about
them
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
passing
feet
xiv
the
prettiest
view
of
amiens
was
from
the
banks
of
the
somme
outside
the
city
on
the
east
side
and
there
was
a
charming
walk
along
the
past
going
down
to
the
river
on
the
opposite
bank
and
past
the
gardens
of
little
chalets
built
for
in
days
of
peace
they
were
of
fantastic
architecture
these
cottages
where
citizens
of
amiens
used
to
come
for
of
boating
and
fishing
and
their
garden
gates
at
the
end
of
wooden
bridges
over
were
of
iron
twisted
into
the
shapes
of
swans
or
flowers
and
there
were
snails
of
on
the
and
painted
woodwork
on
the
walls
in
the
worst
taste
yet
amusing
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
in
their
green
bowers
i
remember
one
called
mon
idee
and
wondered
that
any
man
should
be
proud
of
such
a
freakish
conception
of
a
country
house
they
were
abandoned
during
the
war
except
one
or
two
used
for
casual
rendezvous
between
french
officers
and
their
light
o
loves
and
the
was
used
only
by
stray
couples
who
came
out
for
loneliness
and
british
soldiers
walking
out
with
french
girls
the
punted
down
the
river
in
long
shallow
boats
like
gondolas
laden
high
with
cabbages
cauliflowers
and
asparagus
and
farther
there
was
a
where
orderlies
from
the
new
zealand
hospital
in
amiens
used
to
get
skiffs
for
an
hour
rowing
leaning
on
their
oars
to
look
at
the
picture
of
the
cathedral
rising
like
a
mirage
beyond
the
willows
and
the
encircling
water
with
fleecy
clouds
above
its
glittering
roof
or
lurid
with
the
red
glow
of
sunset
beneath
their
wings
in
the
dusk
or
the
darkness
there
was
silence
along
the
banks
but
for
a
ceaseless
throbbing
of
distant
rising
sometimes
to
a
fury
of
drumming
when
the
french
was
at
work
outside
roye
and
the
lines
beyond
suzanne
it
was
what
the
french
call
la
rafale
des
tambours
de
la
mort
the
ruffle
of
the
drums
of
death
the
winding
waters
of
the
somme
flowed
in
higher
reaches
through
the
hell
of
war
by
biaches
and
this
side
of
peronne
where
dead
bodies
floated
in
slime
and
blood
and
there
was
a
litter
of
broken
bridges
and
barges
and
dead
trees
and
the
river
itself
was
a
highway
into
hell
and
there
came
back
upon
its
tide
in
barges
the
wreckage
of
human
life
fresh
from
the
torturers
these
barges
used
to
unload
their
cargoes
of
maimed
men
at
a
carpenter
yard
just
below
the
bridge
outside
the
city
and
often
as
i
passed
i
saw
human
bodies
being
lifted
out
and
carried
on
stretchers
into
the
wooden
sheds
they
were
the
bad
cases
french
boys
wounded
in
the
abdomen
or
lungs
or
with
their
limbs
torn
off
or
hopelessly
shattered
it
was
an
agony
for
them
to
be
moved
even
on
the
stretchers
some
of
them
cried
out
in
fearful
anguish
or
moaned
like
wounded
animals
again
and
again
those
sounds
spoiled
the
music
of
the
lapping
water
and
the
whispering
of
the
willows
and
the
song
of
birds
the
sight
of
these
tortured
boys
made
useless
in
life
took
the
color
out
of
the
flowers
and
the
beauty
out
of
that
vision
of
the
great
cathedral
splendid
above
the
river
women
watched
them
from
the
bridge
straining
their
eyes
as
the
bodies
were
carried
to
the
bank
i
think
some
of
them
looked
for
their
own
men
one
of
them
spoke
to
me
one
day
that
is
what
the
germans
do
to
our
sons
bandits
assassins
yes
that
is
war
she
put
a
skinny
hand
on
my
arm
will
it
go
on
forever
this
war
until
all
the
men
are
killed
not
so
long
as
that
madame
some
men
will
be
left
alive
the
very
old
and
the
very
young
and
the
lucky
ones
and
those
behind
the
the
germans
are
losing
many
men
monsieur
heaps
madame
i
have
seen
their
bodies
strewn
about
the
ah
that
is
good
i
hope
all
german
women
will
lose
their
sons
as
i
have
lost
where
was
that
madame
over
she
pointed
up
the
somme
he
was
a
good
son
a
fine
boy
it
seems
only
yesterday
he
lay
at
my
breast
my
man
weeps
for
him
they
were
good
it
is
sad
ah
but
yes
it
is
sad

xv
there
was
a
big
hospital
in
amiens
close
to
the
railway
station
organized
by
new
zealand
doctors
and
nurses
i
went
there
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
when
the
army
of
von
kluck
had
passed
through
the
city
and
gone
beyond
the
german
doctors
had
left
behind
the
instruments
abandoned
by
an
english
unit
sharing
the
retreat
the
french
doctor
who
took
me
round
told
me
the
enemy
had
behaved
well
in
amiens
at
least
he
had
refrained
from
atrocities
as
i
went
through
the
long
wards
i
did
not
guess
that
one
day
i
should
be
a
patient
there
that
was
two
years
later
at
the
end
of
the
somme
battles
i
was
worn
out
and
bloodless
after
five
months
of
hard
strain
and
nervous
wear
and
tear
some
bug
had
bitten
me
up
in
the
fields
where
lay
the
unburied
dead
trench
fever
said
the
doctor
you
look
in
need
of
a
rest
said
the
matron
my
word
how
white
you
are
had
a
hard
time
eh
like
the
rest
of
them
i
lay
in
bed
at
the
end
of
the
officers
ward
with
only
one
other
bed
between
me
and
the
wall
that
was
occupied
by
the
of
the
new
zealand
division
opposite
was
another
row
of
beds
in
which
officers
lay
sleeping
or
reading
or
lying
still
with
wistful
eyes
that
all
right
you
going
to
die
said
a
rosy
cheeked
young
orderly
after
taking
my
temperature
and
feeling
my
pulse
it
was
his
way
of
cheering
a
patient
up
he
told
me
how
he
had
been
torpedoed
in
the
dardanelles
while
he
was
ill
with
dysentery
he
indulged
in
reminiscences
with
the
new
zealand
general
who
had
a
grim
gift
of
silence
but
glinting
eyes
in
the
bed
on
my
left
was
a
handsome
boy
with
a
fine
delicate
face
a
subaltern
in
the
coldstream
guards
with
a
pile
of
books
at
his
elbow
all
by
anatole
france
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
laid
in
hospital
and
i
felt
amazingly
weak
and
helpless
but
interested
in
my
surroundings
the
day
nurse
a
tall
buxom
new
zealand
girl
whom
the
general
chaffed
with
sarcastic
humor
and
who
gave
back
more
than
she
got
went
off
duty
with
a
cheery
good
night
all
and
the
night
nurse
took
her
place
and
made
a
first
visit
to
each
bed
she
was
a
dainty
little
woman
with
the
complexion
of
a
delicate
rose
and
large
luminous
eyes
she
had
a
nunlike
look
utterly
pure
but
with
a
spiritual
fire
in
those
shining
eyes
of
hers
for
all
these
men
who
were
like
children
in
her
hands
they
seemed
glad
at
her
coming
good
evening
sister
said
one
man
after
another
even
one
who
had
laid
with
his
eyes
closed
for
an
hour
or
more
with
a
look
of
death
on
his
face
she
knelt
down
beside
each
one
saying
how
are
you
and
chatting
in
a
low
voice
inaudible
to
the
bed
beyond
from
one
bed
i
heard
a
boy
voice
say
oh
do
go
yet
sister
you
have
only
given
me
two
minutes
and
i
want
ten
at
least
i
am
passionately
in
love
with
you
you
know
and
i
have
been
waiting
all
day
for
your
beauty
there
was
a
gust
of
laughter
in
the
ward
the
child
is
at
it
again
said
one
of
the
officers
when
are
you
going
to
write
me
another
sonnet
asked
the
nurse
the
last
one
was
much
the
last
one
was
rotten
said
the
boy
i
have
written
a
real
corker
this
time
read
it
to
yourself
and
do
drop
its
pearls
before
these
well
you
must
be
good
or
i
wo
read
it
at
an
officer
of
the
british
army
who
was
also
a
poet
hurled
the
bedclothes
off
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
in
his
pajamas
i
fed
up
with
everything
i
hate
war
i
do
want
to
be
a
hero
i
do
want
to
die
i
want
to
be
loved
i
a
glutton
for
love
in
his
pajamas
the
boy
looked
a
child
no
older
than
a
schoolboy
who
was
mine
and
who
still
liked
to
be
tucked
up
in
bed
by
his
mother
with
his
tousled
hair
and
his
petulant
grimace
this
lieutenant
might
have
been
peter
pan
from
kensington
the
night
nurse
pretended
to
chide
him
it
was
a
very
gentle
chiding
but
as
abruptly
as
he
had
thrown
off
his
clothes
he
snuggled
under
them
again
and
said
all
right
i
be
good
only
i
want
a
kiss
before
i
go
to
i
became
good
friends
with
that
boy
who
was
a
promising
young
poet
and
a
joyous
creature
no
more
fit
for
war
than
a
child
of
ten
hating
the
muck
and
horror
of
it
not
ashamed
to
confess
his
fear
with
a
boyish
wistfulness
of
hope
that
he
might
not
be
killed
because
he
loved
life
but
he
was
killed
i
had
a
letter
from
his
stricken
mother
months
afterward
the
child
was
missing
then
and
her
heart
cried
out
for
him
opposite
my
bed
was
a
man
from
lancashire
i
suppose
he
had
been
in
a
or
a
factory
a
fellow
as
good
as
gold
and
always
speaking
of
the
but
his
nerves
had
gone
to
pieces
and
he
was
afraid
to
sleep
because
of
the
dreams
that
came
to
him
sister
he
said
do
let
me
go
to
sleep
wake
me
up
if
you
see
me
dozing
i
see
terrible
things
in
my
dreams
frightful
things
i
bear
you
will
sleep
better
she
said
i
am
putting
something
in
your
milk
something
to
stop
the
but
he
dreamed
i
lay
awake
feverish
and
restless
and
heard
the
man
opposite
muttering
and
moaning
in
his
sleep
sometimes
he
would
give
a
long
quivering
sigh
and
sometimes
start
violently
and
then
wake
up
in
a
dazed
way
saying
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
trembling
with
fear
so
that
the
bed
was
shaken
the
night
nurse
was
always
by
his
side
in
a
moment
when
he
called
out
hushing
him
down
whispering
to
him
i
see
pools
of
blood
and
bits
of
dead
bodies
in
my
sleep
he
told
me
it
what
i
saw
up
at
bazentin
there
was
a
fellow
with
his
face
blown
off
walking
about
i
see
him
every
night
queer
is
it
nerves
you
know
i
did
think
i
had
a
nerve
in
my
body
before
this
the
little
night
nurse
came
to
my
bedside
ca
you
sleep
i
afraid
not
my
heart
is
thumping
in
a
queer
way
may
i
smoke
she
put
a
cigarette
between
my
lips
and
lighted
a
match
take
a
few
whiffs
and
then
try
to
sleep
you
need
lots
of
in
the
ward
there
was
only
the
glimmer
of
night
lights
in
red
glasses
and
now
and
then
all
through
the
night
matches
were
lighted
illuminating
the
room
for
a
second
followed
by
the
glowing
end
of
a
cigarette
shining
like
a
star
in
the
darkness
the
sleeping
men
breathed
heavily
tossed
about
violently
gave
strange
jerks
and
starts
sometimes
they
spoke
aloud
in
their
sleep
that
is
a
dud
you
fool
it
will
blow
us
to
now
then
get
on
with
it
ca
you
look
out
they
coming
ca
you
see
them
moving
by
the
wire
the
spirit
of
war
was
in
that
ward
and
hunted
them
even
in
their
sleep
lurking
terrors
surged
up
again
in
their
subconsciousness
sights
which
they
had
tried
to
forget
stared
at
them
through
their
closed
eyelids
the
daylight
came
and
the
night
nurse
slipped
away
and
the
day
nurse
shook
one
shoulders
and
said
time
to
wash
and
shave
no
malingering
it
was
the
discipline
of
the
hospital
men
as
weak
as
rats
had
to
sit
up
in
bed
or
crawl
out
of
it
and
shave
themselves
you
merciless
i
said
laughing
painfully
when
the
day
nurse
dabbed
my
back
with
cold
iodine
at
six
on
a
winter
morning
with
the
windows
wide
open
oh
there
no
mercy
in
this
place
said
the
girl
kill
or
cure
here
and
no
time
to
you
all
devils
said
the
new
zealand
general
you
do
care
a
damn
about
the
patients
so
long
as
you
have
all
the
beds
tidy
by
the
time
the
doctor
comes
around
i
a
general
i
am
and
you
ca
order
me
about
and
if
you
think
i
going
to
shave
at
this
time
in
the
morning
you
are
jolly
well
mistaken
i
am
down
with
dysentery
and
you
forget
it
i
did
get
through
the
dardanelles
to
be
murdered
at
that
where
you
may
be
mistaken
general
said
the
imperturbable
girl
i
have
to
carry
out
orders
and
if
they
lead
to
your
death
not
my
responsibility
i
paid
a
poor
wage
for
this
job
but
i
do
my
duty
rough
or
smooth
kill
or
you
a
vampire
that
what
you
i
a
if
ever
i
hear
you
going
to
marry
a
new
zealand
boy
i
warn
him
against
he
be
too
much
of
a
fool
to
listen
to
i
a
good
mind
to
marry
you
myself
and
beat
you
every
modern
wives
have
strong
muscles
look
at
my
arm
three
nights
in
one
week
there
were
air
raids
and
as
the
german
mark
was
the
railway
station
we
were
in
the
center
of
the
there
was
a
frightful
noise
of
splintering
glass
and
smashing
timber
between
each
crash
of
high
explosives
the
whine
of
shrapnel
from
the
anti
aircraft
guns
had
a
sinister
note
abominable
in
the
ears
of
those
officers
who
had
come
down
from
the
fighting
lines
and
they
lay
very
quiet
the
night
nurse
moved
about
from
bed
to
bed
with
her
her
face
was
pale
but
she
showed
no
other
sign
of
fear
and
was
braver
than
her
patients
at
that
time
though
they
had
done
the
hero
job
all
right
it
was
in
another
hospital
a
year
later
when
i
lay
sick
again
that
an
officer
a
very
gallant
gentleman
said
if
there
is
another
air
raid
i
shall
go
he
had
been
stationed
near
the
of
les
izelquins
near
bethune
and
had
been
in
many
air
raids
when
over
shells
had
blown
his
hut
to
bits
and
killed
his
men
until
he
could
bear
it
no
more
in
the
amiens
hospital
some
of
the
patients
had
their
heads
under
the
bedclothes
like
little
children
xvi
the
life
of
amiens
ended
for
a
while
and
the
city
was
deserted
by
all
its
people
after
the
night
of
march
which
will
be
remembered
forever
to
the
history
of
amiens
as
its
night
of
greatest
tragedy
for
a
week
the
enemy
had
been
advancing
across
the
old
battlefields
after
the
first
onslaught
in
the
morning
of
march
when
our
lines
were
stormed
and
broken
by
his
men
odds
against
our
defending
troops
we
war
correspondents
had
suffered
mental
agonies
like
all
who
knew
what
had
happened
better
than
the
troops
themselves
every
day
after
the
first
we
pushed
out
in
different
directions
hamilton
fyfe
and
i
went
together
sometimes
until
we
came
up
with
the
backwash
of
the
great
retreat
ebbing
back
and
back
day
after
day
with
increasing
speed
until
it
drew
very
close
to
amiens
it
was
a
kind
of
ordered
chaos
terrible
to
see
it
was
a
chaos
like
that
of
upturned
but
with
each
ant
trying
to
rescue
its
eggs
and
sticks
in
a
persistent
orderly
way
directed
by
some
controlling
or
communal
intelligence
only
instead
of
eggs
and
sticks
these
of
ours
in
the
whole
world
behind
our
were
trying
to
rescue
heavy
guns
tanks
ambulances
hospital
stores
ordnance
stores
agricultural
implements
transport
wagons
railway
engines
tents
and
mule
columns
while
actions
were
being
fought
within
gunfire
of
them
and
walking
wounded
were
hobbling
back
along
the
roads
in
this
uproar
of
traffic
and
word
came
that
a
further
retreat
was
happening
and
that
the
enemy
had
broken
through
again
amiens
seemed
threatened
on
the
morning
when
to
the
north
albert
was
held
by
a
mixed
crowd
of
scottish
and
english
troops
too
thin
as
i
could
see
when
i
passed
through
them
to
fight
any
big
action
with
an
enemy
advancing
rapidly
from
courcellette
and
outflanking
our
line
by
montauban
and
fricourt
i
saw
our
men
marching
hastily
in
retreat
to
escape
that
tightening
net
and
while
the
southern
side
of
amiens
was
held
by
a
crowd
of
stragglers
with
cyclist
battalions
clerks
from
headquarters
staffs
and
dismounted
cavalry
commanded
by
carey
sent
down
hurriedly
to
link
them
together
and
stop
a
widening
gap
until
the
french
could
get
to
our
relief
on
the
right
and
until
the
australians
had
come
down
from
flanders
there
was
nothing
on
that
day
to
prevent
the
germans
breaking
through
to
amiens
except
the
courage
of
exhausted
boys
thinly
strung
out
and
the
lagging
footsteps
of
the
germans
themselves
who
had
suffered
heavy
losses
all
the
way
and
were
spent
for
a
while
by
their
progress
over
the
wild
ground
of
the
old
their
heavy
guns
were
far
behind
unable
to
keep
pace
with
the
storm
troops
and
the
enemy
was
relying
entirely
on
and
a
few
but
most
of
our
guns
were
also
out
of
action
captured
or
falling
back
to
new
lines
and
upon
the
speed
with
which
the
enemy
could
mass
his
men
for
a
new
assault
depended
the
safety
of
amiens
and
the
road
to
abbeville
and
the
coast
if
he
could
hurl
fresh
divisions
of
men
against
our
line
on
that
last
night
of
march
or
bring
up
strong
forces
of
cavalry
or
armored
cars
our
line
would
break
and
amiens
would
be
lost
and
all
our
work
would
be
in
jeopardy
that
was
certain
it
was
visible
it
could
not
be
concealed
by
any
camouflage
of
hope
or
courage
it
was
after
a
day
on
the
somme
battlefields
passing
through
our
retiring
troops
that
i
sat
down
with
other
war
correspondents
and
several
officers
to
a
dinner
in
the
old
hotel
du
rhin
in
amiens
it
was
a
dismal
meal
in
a
room
where
there
had
been
much
laughter
and
throughout
the
battles
of
the
somme
in
a
coming
and
going
of
generals
and
staffs
and
officers
of
all
grades
cheery
and
at
these
little
tables
where
there
were
good
wine
and
not
bad
food
and
putting
away
from
their
minds
for
the
time
being
the
thought
of
tragic
losses
or
forlorn
battles
in
which
they
might
fall
in
the
quietude
of
the
hotel
garden
a
little
square
plot
of
grass
bordered
by
i
had
had
strange
conversations
with
boys
who
had
revealed
their
souls
a
little
after
dinner
in
the
darkness
their
faces
bared
now
and
then
by
the
light
of
cigarettes
or
the
flare
of
a
match
death
is
nothing
said
one
young
officer
just
down
from
the
somme
fields
for
a
week
for
jangled
nerves
i
do
care
a
damn
for
death
but
it
the
waiting
for
it
the
devilishness
of
its
uncertainty
the
sight
of
one
pals
blown
to
bits
about
one
and
the
animal
fear
under
that
break
one
pluck
my
nerves
are
like
in
that
garden
other
men
with
a
queer
laugh
now
and
then
between
their
stories
had
told
me
their
experiences
in
and
ditches
under
frightful
fire
which
had
wiped
out
their
platoons
or
companies
a
bedraggled
stork
the
inseparable
companion
of
a
waddling
gull
used
to
listen
to
the
conferences
with
one
leg
tucked
under
his
wing
and
its
head
on
one
side
with
one
watchful
beady
eye
fixed
on
the
figures
in
khaki
until
suddenly
it
would
clap
its
long
bill
rapidly
in
a
wonderful
imitation
of
fire
curse
the
bloody
bird
said
officers
startled
by
this
evil
and
reminiscent
noise
and
caper
with
ridiculous
postures
round
the
imperturbable
gull
beyond
the
lines
from
the
would
come
the
babble
of
many
tongues
and
the
laughter
of
officers
telling
stories
against
one
another
over
their
bottles
of
wine
served
by
gaston
the
between
our
discussions
on
strategy
he
was
a
strategist
by
virtue
of
service
in
the
trenches
and
several
wounds
or
by
von
tirpitz
an
older
whiskered
man
or
by
joseph
who
had
a
high
cackling
laugh
and
strong
views
against
the
fair
sex
and
the
inevitable
cry
la
guerre
when
officers
complained
of
the
service
there
had
been
merry
parties
in
this
room
crowded
with
the
ghosts
of
many
heroic
fellows
but
it
was
a
gloomy
gathering
on
that
evening
at
the
end
of
march
when
we
sat
there
for
the
last
time
there
were
there
officers
who
had
lost
their
towns
and
dadoses
deputy
assistant
director
of
ordnance
supplies
whose
stores
had
gone
up
in
smoke
and
flame
and
a
few
cavalry
officers
back
from
special
leave
and
appalled
by
what
had
happened
in
their
absence
and
a
group
of
officials
who
had
escaped
by
the
skin
of
their
teeth
from
huts
now
far
behind
the
german
lines
and
censors
who
knew
that
no
blue
pencil
could
hide
the
truth
of
the
retreat
and
war
correspondents
who
had
to
write
the
truth
and
hated
it
gaston
whispered
gloomily
behind
my
chair
mon
petit
caporal
he
called
me
that
because
of
a
fancied
likeness
to
the
young
napoleon
dites
donc
vous
croyex
quils
vont
passer
par
amiens
non
ce
pas
possible
ca
pour
la
deuxieme
fois
non
je
refuse
a
le
croire
mais
mauvais
affreux
apres
tant
de
sacrifice
madame
of
the
sat
in
the
for
company
sake
fixing
up
accounts
as
though
the
last
day
of
reckoning
had
come
as
it
had
her
hair
with
its
little
curls
was
still
in
perfect
order
she
had
two
dabs
of
color
on
her
cheeks
as
usual
but
underneath
a
waxen
pallor
she
was
working
out
accounts
with
a
young
officer
who
smoked
innumerable
cigarettes
to
steady
his
nerves
von
tirpitz
was
going
round
in
an
way
pulling
at
his
long
whiskers
the
war
correspondents
talked
together
we
spoke
gloomily
in
low
voices
so
that
the
waiters
should
not
hear
if
they
break
through
to
abbeville
we
shall
lose
the
will
that
be
a
win
for
the
germans
even
then
it
will
make
it
hell
in
the
we
shall
transfer
our
base
to
france
wo
give
in
now
whatever
happens
and
england
never
gives
we
exhausted
all
the
same
it
a
question
of
they
bound
to
take
albert
or
i
do
see
that
at
all
there
still
a
line
a
line
a
handful
of
tired
it
will
be
the
devil
if
they
get
into
it
commands
amiens
they
could
blow
the
place
off
the
they
we
keep
on
saying
wo
we
said
wo
get
the
somme
crossings
but
they
did
let
face
it
squarely
without
any
damned
false
optimism
that
has
been
our
curse
all
better
than
your
damned
it
quite
possible
that
they
will
be
in
this
city
tonight
what
is
to
keep
them
back
there
nothing
up
the
it
would
look
silly
if
we
were
all
captured
how
they
would
laugh
we
should
laugh
though
i
think
we
ought
to
keep
an
eye
on
how
are
we
to
know
we
are
utterly
without
means
of
communication
anything
may
happen
in
the
something
happened
then
it
was
half
past
seven
in
the
evening
there
were
two
enormous
crashes
outside
the
windows
of
the
hotel
du
rhin
all
the
windows
shook
and
the
whole
house
seemed
to
rock
there
was
a
noise
of
rending
wood
many
falls
of
bricks
and
a
cascade
of
falling
glass
instinctively
and
instantly
a
number
of
officers
threw
themselves
on
the
floor
to
escape
flying
bits
of
steel
and
glass
splinters
blown
sideways
then
some
one
laughed
not
this
time
the
officers
rose
from
the
floor
and
took
their
places
at
the
table
and
lit
cigarettes
again
but
they
were
listening
we
listened
to
the
loud
hum
of
airplanes
the
well
known
of
the
gothas
double
fuselage
more
bombs
were
dropped
farther
into
the
town
with
the
same
sound
of
explosives
and
falling
masonry
the
anti
aircraft
guns
got
to
work
and
there
was
the
shrill
chorus
of
shrapnel
shells
winging
over
the
roofs
bang
crash
that
was
nearer
again
some
of
the
officers
strolled
out
of
the
dining
room
they
making
a
mess
outside
perhaps
we
better
get
away
before
it
gets
too
madame
from
the
turned
to
her
accounts
again
i
noticed
the
increasing
pallor
of
her
skin
beneath
the
two
dabs
of
red
but
she
controlled
her
nerves
pluckily
even
smiled
too
at
the
young
officer
who
was
settling
up
for
a
group
of
others
the
moon
had
risen
over
the
houses
of
amiens
it
was
astoundingly
bright
and
beautiful
in
a
clear
sky
and
still
air
and
the
streets
were
flooded
with
white
light
and
the
roofs
glittered
like
silver
above
intense
black
shadows
under
the
gables
where
the
rays
were
barred
by
projecting
walls
curse
the
moon
said
one
officer
how
i
hate
its
damned
light
but
the
moon
cold
and
smiling
looked
down
upon
the
world
at
war
and
into
this
old
city
of
amiens
in
which
bombs
were
bursting
women
were
running
close
to
the
walls
groups
of
soldiers
made
a
dash
from
one
doorway
to
another
horses
galloped
with
heavy
wagons
up
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
while
shrapnel
flickered
in
the
sky
above
them
and
were
hurled
up
in
bursts
of
red
fire
and
explosions
many
horses
were
killed
by
flying
chunks
of
steel
they
lay
bleeding
monstrously
so
that
there
were
large
pools
of
blood
around
them
an
officer
came
into
the
side
door
of
the
hotel
du
rhin
he
was
white
under
his
steel
hat
which
he
pushed
back
while
he
wiped
his
forehead
a
fellow
was
killed
just
by
my
he
said
we
were
standing
in
a
doorway
together
and
something
caught
him
in
the
face
he
fell
like
a
log
without
a
sound
as
dead
as
a
there
was
a
flight
of
midges
in
the
sky
droning
with
that
double
note
which
vibrated
like
strings
very
loudly
and
with
that
sinister
noise
i
could
see
them
quite
clearly
now
and
then
as
they
passed
across
the
face
of
the
moon
black
flitting
things
with
a
glitter
of
shrapnel
below
them
from
time
to
time
they
went
away
until
they
were
specks
of
silver
and
black
but
always
they
came
back
again
or
others
came
with
new
stores
of
bombs
which
they
unloaded
over
amiens
so
it
went
on
all
through
the
night
i
went
up
to
a
bedroom
and
lay
on
a
bed
trying
to
sleep
but
it
was
impossible
my
was
not
strong
enough
to
disregard
those
crashes
in
the
streets
outside
when
houses
collapsed
with
frightful
falling
noises
after
bomb
explosions
my
inner
vision
foresaw
the
ceiling
above
me
pierced
by
one
of
those
bombs
and
the
room
in
which
i
lay
engulfed
in
the
chaos
of
this
wing
of
the
hotel
du
rhin
many
times
i
said
to
hell
with
it
all
i
going
to
sleep
and
then
sat
up
in
the
darkness
at
the
renewal
of
that
tumult
and
switched
on
the
electric
light
no
impossible
to
sleep
outside
in
the
corridor
there
was
a
stampede
of
heavy
boots
officers
were
running
to
get
into
the
cellars
before
the
next
crash
which
might
fling
them
into
the
dismal
gulfs
the
thought
of
that
cellar
pulled
me
down
like
the
law
of
gravity
i
walked
along
the
corridor
now
deserted
and
saw
a
stairway
littered
with
broken
glass
which
my
feet
scrunched
there
were
no
lights
in
the
basement
of
the
hotel
but
i
had
a
going
dim
and
by
its
pale
eye
fumbled
my
way
to
a
stone
passage
leading
to
the
cellar
that
flight
of
stone
steps
was
littered
also
with
broken
glass
in
the
cellar
itself
was
a
mixed
company
of
men
who
had
been
dining
earlier
in
the
evening
joined
by
others
who
had
come
in
from
the
streets
for
shelter
some
of
them
had
dragged
down
mattresses
from
the
bedrooms
and
were
lying
there
in
their
with
their
steel
hats
beside
them
others
were
sitting
on
wooden
cases
wearing
their
steel
hats
while
there
were
others
on
their
knees
and
their
faces
in
their
hands
trying
to
sleep
there
were
some
of
the
town
majors
who
had
lost
their
towns
and
some
canadian
cavalry
officers
and
two
or
three
private
soldiers
and
some
and
orderlies
and
two
young
cooks
of
the
hotel
lying
together
on
dirty
straw
by
one
of
the
stone
pillars
of
the
vaulted
room
two
american
war
correspondents
sims
and
mackenzie
were
sitting
on
a
playing
cards
on
a
board
between
them
they
had
stuck
candles
in
empty
and
the
flickering
light
played
on
their
faces
and
cast
deep
shadows
under
their
eyes
i
stood
watching
these
men
in
that
cellar
and
thought
what
a
good
subject
it
would
be
for
the
pencil
of
muirhead
bone
i
wanted
to
get
a
comfortable
place
there
was
only
one
place
on
the
bare
stones
and
when
i
lay
down
there
my
bones
ached
abominably
and
it
was
very
cold
through
an
aperture
in
the
window
came
a
keen
draft
and
i
could
see
in
a
square
of
moonlit
sky
a
glinting
star
it
was
not
much
of
a
cellar
a
direct
hit
on
the
hotel
du
rhin
would
make
a
nasty
mess
in
this
vaulted
room
and
end
a
game
of
cards
after
fifteen
minutes
i
became
restless
and
decided
that
the
room
upstairs
after
all
was
infinitely
preferable
to
this
damp
cellar
and
these
hard
stones
i
returned
to
it
and
lay
down
on
the
bed
again
and
switched
off
the
light
but
the
noises
outside
the
loneliness
of
the
room
the
sense
of
sudden
death
fluking
overhead
made
me
sit
up
again
and
listen
intently
the
gothas
were
droning
over
amiens
again
many
houses
round
about
were
being
torn
and
shattered
what
a
wreckage
was
being
made
of
the
dear
old
city
i
paced
up
and
down
the
room
smoking
cigarettes
one
after
another
until
a
mighty
explosion
very
close
made
all
my
nerves
quiver
no
decidedly
that
cellar
was
the
best
place
if
one
had
to
die
it
was
better
to
be
in
the
company
of
friends
down
i
went
again
meeting
an
officer
whom
i
knew
well
he
too
was
a
wanderer
between
the
cellar
and
the
abandoned
bedrooms
i
am
getting
bored
with
this
he
said
it
absurd
to
think
that
this
filthy
cellar
is
any
safer
than
upstairs
but
the
dugout
sense
calls
one
down
anyhow
i
ca
we
stood
looking
into
the
cellar
there
was
something
comical
as
well
as
sinister
in
the
sight
of
the
company
there
sprawled
on
the
mattresses
vainly
trying
to
extract
comfort
out
of
for
pillows
or
on
steel
hats
one
friend
of
ours
a
cavalry
officer
of
the
old
school
looked
a
cross
between
charlie
chaplin
and
ol
bill
with
a
fierce
frown
above
his
black
mustache
sims
and
mackenzie
still
played
their
game
of
cards
silently
between
the
guttering
candles
i
think
i
went
from
the
cellar
to
the
bedroom
and
from
the
bedroom
to
the
cellar
six
times
that
night
there
was
never
ten
minutes
relief
from
the
drone
of
gothas
who
were
making
a
complete
job
of
amiens
it
was
at
four
in
the
morning
that
i
met
the
same
officer
who
saw
me
wandering
before
let
us
go
for
a
walk
he
said
the
birds
will
be
away
by
it
was
nothing
like
dawn
when
we
went
out
of
the
side
door
of
the
hotel
du
rhin
and
strolled
into
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
there
was
still
the
same
white
moonlight
intense
and
glittering
but
with
a
paler
sky
it
shone
down
upon
dark
pools
of
blood
and
the
carcasses
of
horses
and
fragments
of
flesh
from
which
a
sickly
smell
rose
the
roadway
was
littered
with
bits
of
timber
and
heaps
of
masonry
many
houses
had
collapsed
into
wild
chaos
and
others
though
still
standing
had
been
stripped
of
their
wooden
frontages
and
their
walls
were
scarred
by
every
part
of
the
old
city
as
we
explored
it
later
had
been
badly
mauled
and
hundreds
of
houses
were
utterly
destroyed
the
air
raid
ceased
at
when
the
first
light
of
dawn
came
into
the
sky
that
day
amiens
was
evacuated
by
command
of
the
french
military
authorities
and
the
inhabitants
trailed
out
of
the
city
leaving
everything
behind
them
i
saw
the
women
locking
up
their
shops
where
there
were
any
doors
to
shut
or
their
shop
still
standing
many
people
must
have
been
killed
and
buried
in
the
night
beneath
their
own
houses
i
never
knew
how
many
the
fugitives
escaped
the
next
phase
of
the
tragedy
in
amiens
when
within
a
few
hours
the
enemy
sent
over
the
first
high
velocities
and
for
many
weeks
afterward
scattered
them
about
the
city
destroying
many
other
houses
a
fire
started
by
these
shells
formed
a
great
gap
between
the
rue
des
jacobins
and
the
rue
des
trois
cailloux
where
there
had
been
an
arcade
and
many
good
shops
and
houses
i
saw
the
fires
smoldering
about
charred
beams
and
twisted
ironwork
when
i
went
through
the
city
after
the
day
of
exodus
xvii
it
was
a
pitiful
adventure
to
go
through
amiens
in
the
days
of
its
desolation
and
we
who
had
known
its
people
so
well
hated
its
loneliness
all
abandoned
towns
have
a
tragic
aspect
i
often
think
of
douai
which
was
left
with
all
its
people
under
compulsion
of
the
enemy
but
amiens
was
strangely
sinister
with
heaps
of
ruins
in
its
narrow
streets
and
the
abominable
noise
of
shells
in
flight
above
its
roofs
and
crashing
now
in
one
direction
and
now
in
another
one
of
our
sentries
came
out
of
a
little
house
near
the
place
and
said
keep
as
much
as
possible
to
the
west
side
of
the
town
sir
been
falling
pretty
thick
on
the
east
side
made
no
end
of
a
mess
on
the
way
back
from
and
the
australian
headquarters
on
the
left
bank
of
the
somme
we
ate
sandwiches
in
the
public
gardens
outside
the
hotel
du
rhin
there
were
big
in
the
and
trees
had
been
torn
down
and
flung
across
the
pathway
and
there
was
a
broken
statue
lying
on
the
grass
some
french
and
english
soldiers
tramped
past
then
there
was
no
living
soul
about
in
the
place
which
had
been
so
crowded
with
life
with
pretty
women
and
children
and
young
officers
doing
their
shopping
and
the
business
of
a
city
at
work
it
makes
one
understand
what
rome
was
like
after
the
barbarians
had
sacked
and
left
it
said
a
friend
of
mine
there
is
something
ghastly
about
it
said
another
we
stood
round
the
hotel
du
rhin
shut
up
and
abandoned
the
house
next
door
had
been
wrecked
and
it
was
scarred
and
wounded
but
still
stood
after
that
night
of
terror
one
day
during
its
desolation
i
went
to
a
banquet
in
amiens
in
the
cellars
of
the
hotel
de
ville
it
was
to
celebrate
the
fourth
of
july
and
an
invitation
had
been
sent
to
me
by
the
french
commandant
de
place
and
the
english
it
was
a
beau
geste
gallant
and
romantic
in
those
days
of
trouble
when
amiens
was
still
closely
beleaguered
but
safer
now
that
australians
and
british
troops
were
holding
the
lines
strongly
outside
with
french
on
their
right
southward
from
boves
and
hangest
wood
the
french
commandant
had
procured
a
collection
of
flags
and
his
men
had
decorated
the
battered
city
with
the
tricolor
it
even
fluttered
above
some
of
the
ruins
as
though
for
the
passing
of
a
pageant
but
only
a
few
cars
entered
the
city
and
drew
up
to
the
town
hall
and
then
took
cover
behind
the
walls
down
below
in
the
cellars
the
damp
walls
were
garlanded
with
flowers
from
the
of
the
somme
now
deserted
by
their
gardeners
and
roses
were
heaped
on
the
general
monash
commanding
the
australian
corps
was
there
with
the
general
of
the
french
division
on
his
right
a
young
american
officer
sat
very
grave
and
silent
not
perhaps
understanding
much
of
the
conversation
about
him
because
most
of
the
guests
were
french
officers
with
senators
and
deputies
of
amiens
and
its
department
there
was
good
wine
to
drink
from
the
cold
vaults
of
the
hotel
de
ville
and
with
the
scent
of
rose
and
hope
for
victory
in
spite
of
all
disasters
the
german
offensive
had
been
checked
and
the
americans
were
now
coming
over
in
a
tide
it
was
a
cheerful
the
old
general
with
a
bristly
mustache
like
a
french
bull
terrier
sat
utterly
silent
eating
steadily
and
fiercely
but
the
french
commandant
de
place
as
handsome
as
athos
as
gay
as
raised
his
glass
to
england
and
france
to
the
gallant
allies
and
to
all
fair
women
he
became
reminiscent
of
his
days
as
a
he
remembered
a
girl
called
marguerite
she
was
exquisite
and
another
called
yvonne
he
had
adored
her
o
life
o
youth
he
had
been
a
careless
young
devil
with
laughter
in
his
heart
xviii
i
suppose
it
was
three
months
later
when
i
saw
the
first
crowds
coming
back
to
their
homes
in
amiens
the
tide
had
turned
and
the
enemy
was
in
hard
retreat
amiens
was
safe
again
they
had
never
had
any
doubt
of
this
homecoming
after
that
day
nearly
three
months
before
when
in
spite
of
the
enemy
being
so
close
foch
said
in
his
calm
way
i
guarantee
they
believed
what
marshal
foch
said
he
always
knew
so
now
they
were
coming
back
again
with
their
little
bundles
and
their
babies
and
small
children
holding
their
hands
or
skirts
according
as
they
had
received
permits
from
the
french
authorities
they
were
the
lucky
ones
whose
houses
still
existed
they
were
conscious
of
their
own
good
fortune
and
came
chattering
very
cheerfully
from
the
station
up
the
street
of
the
three
pebbles
on
their
way
to
their
streets
but
every
now
and
then
they
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
dismay
at
the
damage
done
to
other
people
houses
o
la
la
regardez
ca
affreux
there
was
the
butcher
shop
destroyed
and
the
house
of
poor
little
madeleine
and
old
christopher
workshop
and
the
milliner
place
where
they
used
to
buy
their
sunday
hats
and
that
frightful
gap
where
the
arcade
had
been
truly
poor
amiens
had
suffered
martyrdom
though
thank
god
the
cathedral
still
stood
in
glory
hardly
touched
with
only
one
little
shellhole
through
the
roof
terrible
was
the
damage
up
the
rue
de
beauvais
and
the
streets
that
went
out
of
it
to
one
rubbish
heap
which
had
been
a
corner
house
two
girls
came
back
perhaps
the
french
authorities
had
not
had
that
one
on
their
list
the
girls
came
tripping
home
with
light
in
their
eyes
staring
about
them
ejaculating
pity
for
neighbors
whose
houses
had
been
destroyed
then
suddenly
they
stood
outside
their
own
house
and
saw
that
the
direct
hit
of
a
shell
had
knocked
it
to
bits
the
light
went
out
of
their
eyes
they
stood
there
staring
with
their
mouths
open
some
australian
soldiers
stood
about
and
watched
the
girls
understanding
the
drama
bit
of
a
mess
missy
said
one
of
them
not
much
left
of
the
old
home
eh
the
girls
were
amazingly
brave
they
did
not
weep
they
climbed
up
a
hillock
of
bricks
and
pulled
out
bits
of
old
familiar
things
they
recovered
the
whole
of
a
child
perambulator
with
its
wheels
crushed
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
shrill
laughter
they
turned
round
to
the
australians
pour
les
bebes
they
cried
while
there
life
there
hope
said
one
of
the
australians
with
sardonic
humor
so
the
martyrdom
of
amiens
was
at
an
end
and
life
came
back
to
the
city
that
had
been
dead
and
the
soul
of
the
city
had
survived
i
have
not
seen
it
since
then
but
one
day
i
hope
i
shall
go
back
and
shake
hands
with
gaston
the
waiter
and
say
comment
ca
va
mon
vieux
how
goes
it
my
old
one
and
stroll
into
the
bookshop
and
say
bon
jour
mademoiselle
and
walk
round
the
cathedral
and
see
its
beauty
in
moonlight
again
when
no
one
will
look
up
and
say
curse
the
moon
there
will
be
many
ghosts
in
the
city
at
night
the
ghosts
of
british
officers
and
men
who
thronged
those
streets
in
the
great
war
and
have
now
passed
on
part
six
psychology
on
the
somme
i
all
that
had
gone
before
was
but
a
preparation
for
what
now
was
to
come
until
july
of
the
british
armies
were
only
getting
ready
for
the
big
battles
which
were
being
planned
for
them
by
something
greater
than
generalship
by
the
fate
which
decides
the
doom
of
men
the
first
battles
by
the
old
contemptibles
down
from
mons
and
up
by
ypres
were
defensive
actions
of
rear
guards
holding
the
enemy
back
by
a
thin
wall
of
living
flesh
while
behind
the
new
armies
of
our
race
were
being
raised
the
battles
of
festubert
neuve
chapelle
loos
and
all
minor
attacks
which
led
to
little
salients
were
but
experimental
adventures
in
the
science
of
slaughter
badly
bungled
in
our
laboratories
they
had
no
meaning
apart
from
providing
those
mistakes
by
which
men
learn
ghastly
mistakes
burning
more
than
the
fingers
of
life
children
they
were
only
diversions
of
impatience
in
the
monotonous
routine
of
trench
warfare
by
which
our
men
strengthened
the
mud
walls
of
their
school
of
courage
so
that
the
new
boys
already
coming
out
might
learn
their
lessons
without
more
grievous
interruption
than
came
from
the
daily
visits
of
that
intruder
to
whom
the
fees
were
paid
in
those
two
years
it
was
france
which
fought
the
greatest
battles
flinging
her
sons
against
the
enemy
ramparts
in
desperate
vain
attempts
to
breach
them
at
verdun
in
the
months
that
followed
the
first
month
of
it
was
france
which
sustained
the
full
weight
of
the
german
offensive
on
the
western
front
and
broke
its
human
waves
until
they
were
spent
in
a
sea
of
blood
above
which
the
french
poilus
the
hairy
ones
stood
panting
and
haggard
on
their
rocks
the
germans
had
failed
to
deal
a
fatal
blow
at
the
heart
of
france
france
held
her
head
up
still
bleeding
from
many
wounds
but
defiant
still
and
the
german
high
command
aghast
at
their
own
losses
six
hundred
thousand
casualties
already
conscious
icily
of
a
dwindling
which
one
day
would
be
cut
off
at
its
source
rearranged
their
order
of
battle
and
shifted
the
balance
of
their
weight
eastward
to
smash
russia
somehow
or
other
they
must
smash
a
way
out
by
blows
left
and
right
west
and
east
from
that
ring
of
nations
which
girdled
them
on
the
west
they
would
stand
now
on
the
defensive
fairly
sure
of
their
strength
but
well
aware
that
it
would
be
tried
to
the
utmost
by
that
enemy
which
at
the
back
of
their
brains
at
the
back
of
the
narrow
brains
of
those
vultures
on
the
german
general
staff
they
most
feared
as
their
future
peril
england
they
had
been
fools
to
let
the
british
armies
grow
up
and
wax
so
strong
it
was
the
folly
of
the
madness
by
which
they
had
flung
the
gauntlet
down
to
the
souls
of
proud
peoples
arrayed
against
them
our
armies
were
now
strong
and
trained
and
ready
we
had
about
six
hundred
thousand
in
france
and
flanders
and
in
england
immense
reserves
to
fill
up
the
gaps
that
would
be
made
in
their
ranks
before
the
summer
foliage
turned
to
russet
tints
our
power
in
artillery
had
grown
amazingly
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
every
month
i
had
seen
many
new
batteries
arrive
with
clean
harness
and
yellow
straps
and
young
gunners
who
were
quick
to
get
their
targets
we
were
strong
in
heavies
mostly
howitzers
with
the
terrible
in
their
long
range
and
destructiveness
our
aircraft
had
grown
fast
squadron
upon
squadron
and
our
aviators
had
been
trained
in
the
school
of
general
trenchard
who
sent
them
out
over
the
german
lines
to
learn
how
to
fight
and
how
to
scout
and
how
to
die
like
little
gentlemen
for
a
time
our
had
gone
out
on
buses
primitive
machines
which
were
an
easy
prey
to
the
fokkers
who
waited
for
them
behind
a
screen
of
cloud
and
then
stooped
on
them
like
hawks
sure
of
their
prey
but
to
the
airdrome
near
came
later
models
out
of
date
a
few
weeks
after
their
delivery
replaced
by
still
more
powerful
types
more
perfectly
equipped
for
fighting
our
of
the
air
were
challenging
the
german
champions
on
equal
terms
and
beating
them
back
from
the
lines
unless
they
flew
in
clusters
there
were
times
when
our
gained
an
absolute
supremacy
by
greater
daring
there
was
nothing
they
did
not
dare
and
by
equal
skill
as
a
caution
not
wasting
their
strength
in
unequal
contests
it
was
a
sound
policy
and
enabled
them
to
come
back
again
in
force
and
hold
the
field
for
a
time
by
powerful
concentrations
but
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
our
airmen
at
a
heavy
cost
of
life
kept
the
enemy
down
a
while
and
blinded
his
eyes
the
planting
of
new
airdromes
between
albert
and
amiens
the
long
trail
down
the
roads
of
lorries
packed
with
wings
and
the
furniture
of
aircraft
factories
gave
the
hint
to
those
who
had
eyes
to
see
that
in
this
direction
a
merry
hell
was
being
prepared
there
were
plain
signs
of
massacre
at
hand
all
the
way
from
the
coast
to
the
lines
at
etaples
and
other
places
near
boulogne
hospital
huts
and
tents
were
growing
like
mushrooms
in
the
night
from
casualty
clearing
stations
near
the
front
the
wounded
the
human
wreckage
of
routine
warfare
were
being
evacuated
in
a
hurry
to
the
base
and
from
the
base
to
england
they
were
to
be
cleared
out
of
the
way
so
that
all
the
wards
might
be
empty
for
a
new
population
of
broken
men
in
enormous
numbers
i
went
down
to
see
this
clearance
this
tidying
up
there
was
a
sinister
suggestion
in
the
solitude
that
was
being
made
for
a
multitude
that
was
coming
we
shall
be
very
busy
said
the
doctors
we
must
get
all
the
rest
we
can
now
said
the
nurses
in
a
little
while
every
bed
will
be
filled
said
the
matrons
outside
one
hut
with
the
sun
on
their
faces
were
four
wounded
germans
wurtemburgers
and
bavarians
too
ill
to
move
just
then
each
of
them
had
lost
a
leg
under
the
surgeon
knife
they
were
eating
strawberries
and
seemed
at
peace
i
spoke
to
one
of
them
wie
befinden
sie
sich
ganz
wohl
wir
sind
zufrieden
mit
unsere
i
passed
through
the
wards
and
a
yard
where
the
sat
about
dumb
or
making
queer
foolish
noises
or
staring
with
a
look
of
animal
fear
in
their
eyes
from
a
padded
room
came
a
sound
of
singing
some
idiot
of
war
was
singing
between
bursts
of
laughter
it
all
seemed
so
funny
to
him
that
war
so
mad
we
are
clearing
them
out
said
the
medical
officer
there
will
be
many
more
how
soon
that
was
a
question
nobody
could
answer
it
was
the
only
secret
and
even
that
was
known
in
london
where
little
ladies
in
society
were
naming
the
date
in
confidence
to
men
who
were
directly
concerned
with
it
having
as
they
knew
only
a
few
more
weeks
or
days
of
certain
life
but
i
believe
there
were
not
many
officers
who
would
have
surrendered
deliberately
all
share
in
the
great
in
spite
of
all
the
horror
which
these
young
officers
knew
it
would
involve
they
had
to
be
in
it
and
could
not
endure
the
thought
that
all
their
friends
and
all
their
men
should
be
there
while
they
were
out
of
a
decent
excuse
for
the
safer
side
of
it
yes
a
staff
job
the
intelligence
branch
any
post
behind
the
actual
shambles
and
thank
god
for
the
luck
but
not
an
absolute
shirk
tents
were
being
pitched
in
many
camps
of
the
somme
rows
and
rows
of
bell
tents
and
pavilions
stained
to
a
reddish
brown
small
cities
of
them
were
growing
up
on
the
right
of
the
road
between
amiens
and
albert
at
dernancourt
and
daours
and
i
thought
they
might
be
for
troops
in
reserve
until
i
saw
large
flags
hoisted
to
tall
staffs
and
men
of
the
busy
painting
signs
on
large
sheets
stretched
out
on
the
grass
it
was
always
the
same
sign
the
sign
of
the
cross
that
was
red
there
was
a
vast
traffic
of
lorries
on
the
roads
and
trains
were
traveling
on
light
railways
day
and
night
to
railroads
just
beyond
what
was
all
the
weight
they
carried
no
need
to
ask
the
dumps
were
being
filled
piled
up
with
row
upon
row
of
shells
covered
by
tarpaulin
or
brushwood
when
they
were
all
stacked
enormous
shells
some
of
them
like
gigantic
pigs
without
legs
those
were
for
the
or
the
there
was
enough
force
littered
along
those
roads
above
the
somme
to
blow
cities
off
the
map
it
does
one
good
to
see
said
a
cheery
fellow
the
people
at
home
have
been
putting
their
backs
into
it
thousands
of
girls
have
been
packing
those
things
well
done
munitions
i
could
take
no
joy
in
the
sight
only
a
grim
kind
of
satisfaction
that
at
least
when
our
men
attacked
they
would
have
a
power
of
artillery
behind
them
it
might
help
them
to
smash
through
to
a
finish
if
that
were
the
only
way
to
end
this
suicide
of
nations
my
friend
was
shocked
when
i
said
curse
all
munitions
ii
the
british
armies
as
a
whole
were
not
gloomy
at
the
approach
of
that
new
phase
of
war
which
they
called
the
great
push
as
though
it
were
to
be
a
glorified
it
is
difficult
perhaps
impossible
to
know
the
thoughts
of
vast
masses
of
men
moved
by
some
sensational
adventure
but
a
man
would
be
a
liar
if
he
pretended
that
british
troops
went
forward
to
the
great
attack
with
hangdog
looks
or
any
visible
sign
of
fear
in
their
souls
i
think
most
of
them
were
uplifted
by
the
belief
that
the
old
days
of
trench
warfare
were
over
forever
and
that
they
would
break
the
enemy
lines
by
means
of
that
enormous
behind
them
and
get
him
on
the
there
would
be
movement
excitement
triumphant
victories
and
then
the
end
of
the
war
in
spite
of
all
risks
it
would
be
enormously
better
than
the
routine
of
the
trenches
they
would
be
getting
on
with
the
job
instead
of
standing
still
and
being
shot
at
by
invisible
if
we
once
get
the
germans
in
the
open
we
shall
go
straight
through
that
was
the
opinion
of
many
young
officers
at
that
time
and
for
once
they
agreed
with
their
generals
it
seemed
to
be
a
question
of
getting
them
in
the
open
and
i
confess
that
when
i
studied
the
trench
maps
and
saw
the
enemy
defensive
earthworks
thirty
miles
deep
in
one
vast
maze
of
trenches
and
redoubts
and
barbed
wire
and
tunnels
i
was
appalled
at
the
task
which
lay
before
our
men
they
did
not
know
what
they
were
being
asked
to
do
they
had
not
seen
then
those
awful
maps
we
were
at
the
height
and
glory
of
our
strength
out
of
england
had
come
the
flower
of
our
youth
and
out
of
scotland
and
wales
and
canada
and
australia
and
new
zealand
even
out
of
ireland
with
the
division
of
the
south
and
west
and
the
of
ulster
the
new
armies
were
made
up
of
all
the
volunteers
who
had
answered
the
call
to
the
colors
not
waiting
for
the
conscription
by
class
which
followed
later
they
were
the
ardent
ones
the
young
men
from
office
factory
shop
and
field
university
and
public
school
the
best
of
our
intelligence
were
there
the
noblest
of
our
manhood
the
strength
of
our
heart
the
beauty
of
our
soul
in
those
battalions
which
soon
were
to
be
flung
into
explosive
fires
iii
in
the
month
of
may
a
new
type
of
manhood
was
filling
the
old
roads
behind
the
front
i
saw
them
first
in
the
little
old
town
of
where
always
there
was
a
coming
and
going
of
french
and
english
soldiers
it
was
and
the
grande
place
not
very
grand
was
crowded
with
booths
and
old
ladies
in
black
and
young
girls
with
checkered
aprons
over
their
black
frocks
and
pigs
and
clucking
fowls
suddenly
the
people
scattered
and
there
was
a
rumble
and
rattle
of
wheels
as
a
long
line
of
transport
wagons
came
through
the
square
by
jove
australians
there
was
no
mistaking
them
their
told
one
at
a
glance
but
without
them
i
should
have
known
they
had
a
distinctive
type
of
their
own
which
marked
them
out
from
all
other
soldiers
of
ours
along
those
roads
of
war
they
were
fellows
who
came
riding
through
the
little
old
market
town
british
unmistakably
yet
not
english
not
irish
nor
scottish
nor
canadian
they
looked
hard
with
the
hardness
of
a
boyhood
and
a
breeding
away
from
cities
or
at
least
away
from
the
softer
training
of
our
way
of
life
they
had
merry
eyes
especially
for
the
girls
round
the
stalls
but
resolute
mouths
and
they
rode
their
horses
with
an
easy
grace
in
the
saddle
as
though
born
to
riding
and
drove
their
wagons
with
a
recklessness
among
the
little
booths
that
was
justified
by
half
an
inch
between
an
iron
axle
and
an
old
table
of
colored
ribbons
those
men
who
had
come
out
of
the
hell
of
the
dardanelles
and
the
burning
drought
of
egyptian
sands
looked
wonderfully
fresh
in
france
youth
keen
as
steel
with
a
flash
in
the
eyes
with
an
utter
carelessness
of
any
peril
ahead
came
riding
down
the
street
they
were
glad
to
be
there
everything
was
new
and
good
to
them
though
so
old
and
stale
to
many
of
us
and
after
their
adventures
in
the
east
they
found
it
splendid
to
be
in
a
civilized
country
with
water
in
the
sky
and
in
the
fields
with
green
trees
about
them
and
flowers
in
the
grass
and
white
people
who
were
friendly
when
they
came
up
in
the
train
from
marseilles
they
were
all
at
the
windows
drinking
in
the
look
of
the
french
landscape
and
one
of
their
officers
told
me
that
again
and
again
he
heard
the
same
words
spoken
by
those
lads
of
his
it
a
good
country
to
fight
for
it
like
being
home
at
first
they
felt
chilly
in
france
for
the
weather
had
been
bad
for
them
during
the
first
weeks
in
april
when
the
wind
had
blown
cold
and
had
broken
into
sharp
squalls
talking
to
the
men
i
saw
them
shiver
a
little
and
heard
their
teeth
chatter
but
they
said
they
liked
a
moist
climate
with
a
bite
in
the
wind
after
all
the
blaze
and
glare
of
the
egyptian
sun
one
of
their
pleasures
in
being
there
was
the
opportunity
of
buying
sweets
they
ca
have
too
much
of
them
said
one
of
the
officers
and
the
idea
that
those
hard
fellows
whose
homeric
fighting
qualities
had
been
proved
should
be
enthusiastic
for
lollipops
seemed
to
me
an
amusing
touch
of
character
for
tough
as
they
were
and
keen
as
they
were
those
australian
soldiers
were
but
children
with
a
wonderful
simplicity
of
youth
and
the
gift
of
laughter
i
saw
them
laughing
when
for
the
first
time
they
tried
on
the
which
none
of
us
ever
left
behind
when
we
went
near
the
that
horror
of
war
on
the
western
front
was
new
to
them
was
not
one
of
the
weapons
used
by
the
turks
and
the
seemed
a
joke
to
the
groups
of
australians
trying
on
the
headgear
in
the
fields
and
changing
themselves
into
obscene
specters
but
one
man
watching
them
gave
a
shudder
and
said
it
a
pity
such
splendid
boys
should
have
to
risk
this
foul
way
of
they
did
not
hear
his
words
and
we
heard
their
laughter
again
on
that
first
day
of
their
arrival
i
stood
in
a
courtyard
with
a
young
officer
whose
gray
eyes
had
a
fine
clear
light
which
showed
the
spirit
of
the
man
and
as
we
talked
he
pointed
out
some
of
the
boys
who
passed
in
and
out
of
an
old
barn
one
of
them
had
done
fine
work
on
the
peninsula
contemptuous
of
all
risks
another
had
gone
out
under
heavy
fire
to
bring
in
a
wounded
friend
oh
they
are
great
lads
said
the
captain
of
the
company
but
now
they
want
to
get
at
the
germans
and
finish
the
job
quickly
give
them
a
fair
chance
and
they
go
they
went
far
from
that
time
to
the
end
and
fought
with
a
simple
terrible
courage
they
had
none
of
the
discipline
imposed
upon
our
men
by
regular
traditions
they
were
gipsy
fellows
with
none
but
the
gipsy
law
in
their
hearts
intolerant
of
restraint
with
no
respect
for
rank
or
caste
unless
it
carried
strength
with
it
difficult
to
handle
behind
the
lines
primitive
men
but
lovable
human
generous
souls
when
their
bayonets
were
not
red
with
blood
their
discipline
in
battle
was
the
best
they
wanted
to
get
to
a
place
ahead
they
would
fight
the
devils
of
hell
to
get
there
the
followed
them
with
rosy
cheeks
like
english
boys
of
kent
and
more
gentle
manners
than
the
other
anzacs
and
the
same
courage
they
went
far
too
and
set
the
pace
awhile
in
the
last
lap
but
that
in
the
summer
of
was
far
away
in
those
last
days
of
june
before
the
big
battles
began
the
countryside
of
the
somme
valley
was
filled
with
splendor
the
mustard
seed
had
spread
a
yellow
carpet
in
many
meadows
so
that
they
were
fields
of
the
cloth
of
gold
and
clumps
of
red
clover
grew
like
flowers
of
blood
the
hedges
about
the
villages
of
picardy
were
white
with
elderflower
and
drenched
with
scent
it
was
haymaking
time
and
french
women
and
children
were
tossing
the
hay
on
wooden
pitchforks
during
hot
days
which
came
between
heavy
rains
our
men
were
marching
through
that
beauty
and
were
conscious
of
it
i
think
and
glad
of
life
iv
boulogne
was
a
port
through
which
all
our
youth
passed
between
england
and
the
long
straight
road
which
led
to
no
man
land
the
men
were
coming
back
by
every
tide
and
all
other
leave
was
canceled
new
drafts
were
pouring
through
the
port
by
tens
of
thousands
all
manner
of
men
of
all
our
breed
marching
in
long
columns
from
the
quayside
where
they
had
orders
yelled
at
them
through
megaphones
by
and
other
blue
tabbed
officers
who
dealt
with
them
as
cattle
for
the
slaughterhouses
i
watched
them
landing
from
the
transports
which
came
in
so
densely
crowded
with
the
human
freight
that
the
men
were
wedged
together
on
the
decks
like
herrings
in
barrels
they
crossed
from
one
boat
to
another
to
reach
the
gangways
and
one
by
one
interminably
as
it
seemed
with
rifle
gripped
and
pack
hunched
and
steel
hat
clattering
like
a
tinker
kettle
came
down
the
inclined
plank
and
lurched
ashore
they
were
english
lads
from
every
country
scots
irish
welsh
of
every
regiment
australians
south
africans
canadians
west
indian
negroes
of
the
garrison
artillery
sikhs
pathans
and
dogras
of
the
indian
cavalry
some
of
them
had
been
sick
and
there
was
a
greenish
pallor
on
their
faces
most
of
them
were
deeply
tanned
many
of
them
stepped
on
the
quayside
of
france
for
the
first
time
after
months
of
training
and
i
could
tell
those
sometimes
by
the
furtive
look
they
gave
at
the
crowded
scene
about
them
and
by
a
sudden
glint
in
their
eyes
a
faint
reflection
of
the
emotion
that
was
in
them
because
this
was
another
stage
on
their
adventure
of
war
and
the
drawbridge
was
down
at
last
between
them
and
the
enemy
that
was
all
just
that
look
and
lips
tightened
now
grimly
and
the
pack
hunched
higher
then
they
fell
in
by
number
and
marched
away
with
redcaps
to
guard
them
across
the
bridge
into
the
town
of
boulogne
and
beyond
to
the
great
camp
near
etaples
and
near
the
hospital
so
that
german
aircraft
had
a
good
argument
for
smashing
red
cross
huts
where
some
of
them
would
wait
until
somebody
said
they
were
wanted
in
droves
as
soon
as
the
fighting
began
on
the
first
day
of
july
the
bun
shops
in
boulogne
were
filled
with
nurses
all
kinds
of
girls
in
uniforms
which
glinted
with
and
buttons
they
ate
large
quantities
of
buns
at
odd
hours
of
mornings
and
afternoons
and
officers
of
all
kinds
waiting
for
trains
crowded
the
folkestone
hotel
and
restaurants
where
they
spent
two
hours
over
luncheon
and
three
hours
over
dinner
drinking
red
wine
talking
shop
the
shop
of
units
sections
cavalry
squadrons
gas
schools
and
schools
regular
inhabitants
of
boulogne
officers
at
the
base
passed
to
inner
rooms
with
french
ladies
of
dangerous
appearance
and
the
transients
envied
them
and
said
those
fellows
have
all
the
luck
what
their
secret
how
do
they
arrange
these
cushie
jobs
from
open
windows
came
the
music
of
gramophones
through
curtains
there
were
glimpses
of
khaki
tunics
and
sam
brown
belts
in
juxtaposition
with
silk
blouses
and
coiled
hair
and
white
arms
opposite
the
folkestone
there
was
a
park
of
ambulances
driven
by
scottish
women
who
were
always
on
the
move
from
one
part
of
the
town
to
the
other
came
hooting
with
all
aglow
in
red
tabs
and
armbands
thirsty
for
little
cocktails
after
a
dusty
drive
everywhere
in
the
streets
and
on
the
esplanade
there
was
incessant
saluting
the
arms
of
men
were
never
still
it
was
like
the
vitus
disease
tommies
and
jocks
saluted
every
subaltern
with
an
automatic
gesture
of
convulsive
energy
every
subaltern
acknowledged
these
movements
and
in
turn
saluted
a
multitude
of
majors
colonels
and
generals
the
thing
became
farcical
a
monstrous
absurdity
of
human
relationship
yet
pleasing
to
the
vanity
of
men
lifted
up
above
the
lowest
caste
it
seemed
to
me
an
intensification
of
the
snob
instinct
in
the
soul
of
man
only
the
australians
stood
out
against
it
and
went
by
all
officers
except
their
own
with
a
careless
slouch
and
a
look
of
to
hell
with
all
that
seated
on
high
stools
in
the
folkestone
our
young
officers
clinked
their
cocktails
and
then
whispered
together
when
it
coming
in
a
few
days
i
for
the
gommecourt
do
you
think
we
shall
get
through
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
cavalry
are
massing
for
a
great
drive
as
soon
as
we
make
the
gap
they
ride
into
the
by
god
there
be
some
slaughter
i
think
the
old
boche
will
crack
this
well
cheerio
there
was
a
sense
of
enormous
drama
at
hand
and
the
excitement
of
it
in
boys
hearts
drugged
all
doubt
and
fears
it
was
only
the
older
men
and
the
introspective
who
suffered
from
the
torture
of
apprehension
even
timid
fellows
in
the
ranks
were
i
imagine
strengthened
and
exalted
by
the
communal
courage
of
their
company
or
battalion
for
courage
as
well
as
fear
is
infectious
and
the
psychology
of
the
crowd
uplifts
the
individual
to
immense
heights
of
daring
when
alone
he
would
be
terror
stricken
the
spirit
of
pride
in
name
and
tradition
was
in
each
battalion
of
the
new
army
extended
later
to
the
division
which
became
the
unit
of
esprit
de
corps
they
must
not
let
the
battalion
they
would
do
their
damnedest
to
get
farther
than
any
other
crowd
to
bag
more
prisoners
to
gain
more
there
was
rivalry
even
among
the
platoons
and
the
companies
a
company
would
show
b
company
the
way
to
go
their
was
a
great
fellow
their
platoon
commanders
were
fine
kids
with
anything
like
a
chance
in
that
spirit
as
far
as
i
an
outsider
could
see
and
hear
did
our
battalions
of
boys
march
forward
to
the
great
push
whistling
singing
jesting
until
their
lips
were
dry
and
their
throats
parched
in
the
dust
and
even
the
merriest
jesters
of
all
were
silent
under
the
weight
of
their
packs
and
rifles
so
they
moved
up
day
by
day
through
the
beauty
of
that
june
in
france
thousands
of
men
hundreds
of
thousands
to
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
of
the
somme
where
the
enemy
was
intrenched
in
fortress
positions
and
where
already
before
the
last
days
of
june
gunfire
was
flaming
over
a
vast
sweep
of
country
v
on
the
of
july
began
those
prodigious
battles
which
only
lulled
down
at
times
during
two
and
a
half
years
more
when
our
british
armies
fought
with
desperate
sacrificial
valor
beyond
all
previous
reckoning
when
the
flower
of
our
youth
was
cast
into
that
furnace
month
after
month
recklessly
with
prodigal
spendthrift
haste
when
those
boys
were
mown
down
in
swaths
by
blown
to
bits
by
gassed
in
thousands
until
all
that
country
became
a
graveyard
when
they
went
forward
to
new
assaults
or
fell
back
in
rearguard
actions
with
a
certain
knowledge
that
they
had
in
their
first
attack
no
more
than
one
chance
in
five
of
escape
next
time
one
chance
in
four
then
one
chance
in
three
one
chance
in
two
and
after
that
no
chance
at
all
on
the
line
of
averages
as
worked
out
by
their
experience
of
luck
more
boys
came
out
to
take
their
places
and
more
and
more
conscripts
following
volunteers
younger
brothers
following
elder
brothers
never
did
they
revolt
from
the
orders
that
came
to
them
never
a
battalion
broke
into
mutiny
against
inevitable
martyrdom
they
were
obedient
to
the
command
above
them
their
discipline
did
not
break
however
profound
was
the
despair
of
the
individual
and
it
was
i
know
deep
as
the
wells
of
human
tragedy
in
many
hearts
the
mass
moved
as
it
was
directed
backward
or
forward
this
way
and
that
from
one
shambles
to
another
in
mud
and
in
blood
with
the
same
massed
valor
as
that
which
uplifted
them
before
that
first
day
of
july
with
an
intensified
pride
in
the
fame
of
their
divisions
with
a
more
eager
desire
for
public
knowledge
of
their
deeds
with
a
loathing
of
war
misery
with
a
sense
of
its
supreme
folly
yet
with
a
refusal
in
their
souls
to
acknowledge
defeat
or
to
stop
this
side
of
victory
in
each
battle
there
were
officers
and
men
who
risked
death
deliberately
and
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
did
acts
of
superhuman
courage
and
because
of
the
number
of
these
feats
the
record
of
them
is
monotonous
dull
familiar
the
mass
followed
their
lead
and
even
poor
of
whom
there
were
many
as
in
all
armies
had
courage
enough
as
a
rule
to
get
as
far
as
the
center
of
the
fury
before
their
knees
gave
way
or
they
dropped
dead
each
wave
of
boyhood
that
came
out
from
england
brought
a
new
mass
of
physical
and
spiritual
valor
as
great
as
that
which
was
spent
and
in
the
end
it
was
an
irresistible
tide
which
broke
down
the
last
barriers
and
swept
through
in
a
rush
to
victory
which
we
gained
at
the
cost
of
nearly
a
million
dead
and
a
high
sum
of
living
agony
and
all
our
wealth
and
a
spiritual
bankruptcy
worse
than
material
loss
so
that
now
england
is
for
a
time
sick
to
death
and
drained
of
her
old
pride
and
power
vi
i
remember
as
though
it
were
yesterday
in
vividness
and
a
hundred
years
ago
in
time
the
bombardment
which
preceded
the
battles
of
the
somme
with
a
group
of
officers
i
stood
on
the
high
ground
above
albert
looking
over
to
gommecourt
and
thiepval
and
la
boisselle
on
the
left
side
of
the
german
salient
and
then
by
crossing
the
road
to
fricourt
mametz
and
montauban
on
the
southern
side
from
albert
westward
past
thiepval
wood
ran
the
little
river
of
the
ancre
and
on
the
german
side
the
ground
rose
steeply
to
usna
hill
by
la
boisselle
and
to
thiepval
chateau
above
the
wood
it
was
a
formidable
defensive
position
one
fortress
girdled
by
line
after
line
of
trenches
and
earthwork
redoubts
and
deep
tunnels
and
dugouts
in
which
the
german
troops
could
live
below
ground
until
the
moment
of
attack
the
length
of
our
front
of
assault
was
about
twenty
miles
round
the
side
of
the
salient
to
the
village
of
bray
on
the
somme
where
the
french
joined
us
and
continued
the
battle
from
where
we
stood
we
could
see
a
wide
panorama
of
the
german
positions
and
beyond
now
and
then
when
the
smoke
of
shellfire
drifted
i
caught
glimpses
of
green
fields
and
flower
patches
beyond
the
trench
lines
and
church
spires
beyond
the
range
of
guns
rising
above
clumps
of
trees
in
summer
foliage
immediately
below
in
the
foreground
was
the
village
of
albert
not
much
ruined
then
with
its
church
and
tower
from
which
there
hung
head
downward
the
golden
virgin
with
her
babe
outstretched
as
though
as
a
over
all
this
strife
that
leaning
statue
which
i
had
often
passed
on
the
way
to
the
trenches
was
now
revealed
brightly
with
a
golden
glamour
as
sheets
of
flame
burst
through
a
heavy
veil
of
smoke
over
the
valley
in
a
field
close
by
some
troops
were
being
ticketed
with
yellow
labels
fastened
to
their
backs
it
was
to
distinguish
them
so
that
artillery
observers
might
know
them
from
the
enemy
when
their
turn
came
to
go
into
the
battleground
something
in
the
sight
of
those
yellow
tickets
made
me
feel
sick
away
behind
a
french
farmer
was
cutting
his
grass
with
a
long
scythe
in
steady
sweeping
strokes
only
now
and
then
did
he
stand
to
look
over
at
the
most
frightful
picture
of
battle
ever
seen
until
then
by
human
eyes
i
wondered
and
wonder
still
what
thoughts
were
passing
through
that
old
brain
to
keep
him
at
his
work
quietly
steadily
on
the
edge
of
hell
for
there
quite
close
and
clear
was
hell
of
man
making
produced
by
chemists
and
scientists
after
centuries
in
search
of
knowledge
there
were
the
fires
of
hate
produced
out
of
the
passion
of
humanity
after
a
thousand
years
of
christendom
and
of
progress
in
the
arts
of
beauty
there
was
the
of
our
poor
damned
human
race
where
the
most
civilized
nations
of
the
world
were
on
each
side
of
the
bonfires
it
was
worth
watching
by
a
human
ant
i
remember
the
noise
of
our
guns
as
all
our
batteries
took
their
parts
in
a
vast
orchestra
of
drumfire
the
tumult
of
the
fieldguns
merged
into
thunderous
waves
behind
me
a
grandmother
fired
single
strokes
and
each
one
was
an
enormous
shock
shells
were
rushing
through
the
air
like
droves
of
giant
birds
with
beating
wings
and
with
strange
wailings
the
german
lines
were
in
eruption
their
earthworks
were
being
tossed
up
and
fountains
of
earth
sprang
up
between
columns
of
smoke
black
columns
and
white
which
stood
rigid
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
sank
into
the
banks
of
fog
flames
gushed
up
red
and
angry
rending
those
banks
of
mist
with
strokes
of
lightning
in
their
light
i
saw
trees
falling
branches
tossed
like
twigs
black
things
hurtling
through
space
in
the
night
before
the
battle
when
that
bombardment
had
lasted
several
days
and
nights
the
fury
was
intensified
red
flames
darted
hither
and
thither
like
little
red
devils
as
our
trench
mortars
got
to
work
above
the
slogging
of
the
guns
there
were
louder
noises
and
volcanoes
of
earth
and
fire
spouted
as
high
as
the
clouds
one
convulsion
of
this
kind
happened
above
usna
hill
with
a
long
terrifying
roar
and
a
monstrous
gush
of
flame
what
is
that
asked
some
one
it
must
be
the
mine
we
charged
at
la
boisselle
the
biggest
that
has
ever
it
was
a
good
guess
when
later
in
the
battle
i
stood
by
the
crater
of
that
mine
and
looked
into
its
gulf
i
wondered
how
many
germans
had
been
hurled
into
eternity
when
the
earth
had
opened
the
grave
was
big
enough
for
a
battalion
of
men
with
horses
and
wagons
below
the
chalk
of
the
crater
lips
often
on
the
way
to
bapaume
i
stepped
off
the
road
to
look
into
that
white
gulf
remembering
the
moment
when
i
saw
the
gust
of
flame
that
rent
the
earth
about
it
vii
there
was
the
illusion
of
victory
on
that
first
day
of
the
somme
battles
on
the
right
of
the
line
by
fricourt
and
it
was
not
until
a
day
or
two
later
that
certain
awful
rumors
i
had
heard
from
wounded
men
and
officers
who
had
attacked
on
the
left
up
by
gommecourt
thiepval
and
serre
were
confirmed
by
certain
knowledge
of
tragic
disaster
on
that
side
of
the
the
illusion
of
victory
with
all
the
price
and
pain
of
it
came
to
me
when
i
saw
the
german
rockets
rising
beyond
the
villages
of
mametz
and
montauban
and
our
barrage
fire
lifting
to
a
range
beyond
the
first
lines
of
german
trenches
and
our
support
troops
moving
forward
in
masses
to
captured
ground
we
had
broken
through
by
the
heroic
assault
of
our
english
and
scottish
troops
west
yorks
yorks
and
lancs
lincolns
durhams
northumberland
fusiliers
norfolks
and
berkshires
liverpools
manchesters
gordons
and
royal
scots
all
those
splendid
men
i
had
seen
marching
to
their
lines
we
had
smashed
through
the
ramparts
of
the
german
fortress
through
that
maze
of
earthworks
and
tunnels
which
had
appalled
me
when
i
saw
them
on
the
maps
and
over
which
i
had
gazed
from
time
to
time
from
our
trenches
when
those
places
seemed
impregnable
i
saw
crowds
of
prisoners
coming
back
under
escort
fifteen
hundred
had
been
counted
in
the
first
day
and
they
had
the
look
of
a
defeated
army
our
lightly
wounded
men
thousands
of
them
were
shouting
and
laughing
as
they
came
down
behind
the
lines
wearing
german
caps
and
helmets
from
amiens
civilians
straggled
out
along
the
roads
as
far
as
they
were
allowed
by
military
police
and
waved
hands
and
cheered
those
boys
of
ours
vive
cried
old
men
raising
their
hats
old
women
wept
at
the
sight
of
those
gay
wounded
the
lightly
touched
glad
of
escape
rejoicing
in
their
luck
and
in
the
glory
of
life
which
was
theirs
still
and
cried
out
to
them
with
shrill
words
of
praise
and
exultation
nous
les
aurons
les
sales
boches
ah
ils
sont
foutus
ces
bandits
la
victoire
grace
a
vous
petits
soldats
anglais
victory
the
spirit
of
victory
in
the
hearts
of
fighting
men
and
of
women
excited
by
the
sight
of
those
bandaged
heads
those
bare
brawny
arms
splashed
with
blood
those
laughing
heroes
it
looked
like
victory
in
those
days
as
war
correspondents
we
were
not
so
expert
in
balancing
the
profit
and
loss
as
afterward
we
became
when
i
went
into
fricourt
on
the
third
day
of
battle
after
the
last
germans
who
had
clung
on
to
its
ruins
had
been
cleared
out
by
the
yorkshires
and
lincolns
of
the
division
that
division
which
had
been
so
humiliated
at
loos
and
now
was
wonderful
in
courage
and
when
the
manchesters
and
gordons
of
the
division
had
captured
montauban
and
repulsed
fierce
it
looked
like
victory
because
of
the
german
dead
that
lay
there
in
their
battered
trenches
and
the
filth
and
stench
of
death
over
all
that
mangled
ground
and
the
enormous
destruction
wrought
by
our
guns
and
the
fury
of
fire
which
we
were
still
pouring
over
the
enemy
lines
from
batteries
which
had
moved
forward
i
went
down
flights
of
steps
into
german
dugouts
astonished
by
their
depth
and
strength
our
men
did
not
build
like
this
this
german
industry
was
a
rebuke
to
us
yet
we
had
captured
their
work
and
the
dead
bodies
of
their
laborers
lay
in
those
dark
caverns
killed
by
our
bombers
who
had
flung
down
handgrenades
i
drew
back
from
those
fat
corpses
they
looked
monstrous
lying
there
crumpled
up
amid
a
foul
litter
of
clothes
stickbombs
old
boots
and
bottles
groups
of
dead
lay
in
ditches
which
had
once
been
trenches
flung
into
chaos
by
that
bombardment
i
had
seen
they
had
been
bayoneted
i
remember
one
man
an
elderly
fellow
sitting
up
with
his
back
to
a
bit
of
earth
with
his
hands
half
raised
he
was
smiling
a
little
though
he
had
been
stabbed
through
the
belly
and
was
stone
dead
victory
some
of
the
german
dead
were
young
boys
too
young
to
be
killed
for
old
men
crimes
and
others
might
have
been
old
or
young
one
could
not
tell
because
they
had
no
faces
and
were
just
masses
of
raw
flesh
in
rags
and
uniforms
legs
and
arms
lay
separate
without
any
bodies
thereabouts
outside
montauban
there
was
a
heap
of
our
own
dead
young
gordons
and
manchesters
of
the
division
they
had
been
caught
by
blasts
of
machinegun
fire
but
our
dead
seemed
scarce
in
the
places
where
i
walked
victory
well
we
had
gained
some
ground
and
many
prisoners
and
here
and
there
some
guns
but
as
i
stood
by
montauban
i
saw
that
our
line
was
a
sharp
salient
looped
round
mametz
village
and
then
dipping
sharply
southward
to
fricourt
o
god
had
we
only
made
another
salient
after
all
that
monstrous
effort
to
the
left
there
was
fury
at
la
boisselle
where
a
few
broken
trees
stood
black
on
the
skyline
on
a
chalky
ridge
storms
of
german
shrapnel
were
bursting
there
and
machineguns
were
firing
in
spasms
in
contalmaison
round
a
chateau
which
stood
high
above
ruined
houses
shells
were
bursting
with
thunderclaps
our
shells
german
gunners
in
invisible
batteries
were
sweeping
our
lines
with
barrage
fire
it
roamed
up
and
down
this
side
of
montauban
wood
just
ahead
of
me
and
now
and
then
shells
smashed
among
the
houses
and
barns
of
fricourt
and
over
mametz
there
was
suddenly
a
hurricane
of
our
men
were
working
like
ants
in
those
muck
heaps
a
battalion
moved
up
toward
boisselle
from
a
ridge
above
fricourt
where
once
i
had
seen
a
tall
crucifix
between
two
trees
which
our
men
called
the
poodles
a
body
of
men
came
down
and
shrapnel
burst
among
them
and
they
fell
and
disappeared
in
tall
grass
stretcher
bearers
came
slowly
through
fricourt
village
with
living
burdens
some
of
them
were
german
soldiers
carrying
our
wounded
and
their
own
walking
wounded
hobbled
slowly
with
their
arms
round
each
other
shoulders
germans
and
english
together
a
boy
in
a
steel
hat
stopped
me
and
held
up
a
bloody
hand
a
bit
of
luck
he
said
i
off
after
eighteen
months
of
german
prisoners
came
down
with
a
few
english
soldiers
as
their
escort
i
saw
distant
groups
of
them
and
a
shell
smashed
into
one
group
and
scattered
it
the
living
ran
leaving
their
dead
ambulances
driven
by
daring
fellows
drove
to
the
far
edge
of
fricourt
not
a
healthy
place
and
loaded
up
with
wounded
from
a
dressing
station
in
a
tunnel
there
it
was
a
wonderful
picture
of
war
in
all
its
filth
and
shambles
but
was
it
victory
i
knew
then
that
it
was
only
a
breach
in
the
german
bastion
and
that
on
the
left
gommecourt
way
there
had
been
black
tragedy
viii
on
the
left
where
the
and
corps
were
directing
operations
the
assault
had
been
delivered
by
the
and
divisions
the
positions
in
front
of
them
were
gommecourt
and
beaumont
hamel
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
ancre
and
thiepval
wood
on
the
right
side
of
the
ancre
leading
up
to
thiepval
chateau
on
the
crest
of
the
cliff
these
were
the
hardest
positions
to
attack
because
of
the
rising
ground
and
the
immense
strength
of
the
enemy
earthworks
and
tunneled
defenses
but
our
generals
were
confident
that
the
gun
power
at
their
disposal
was
sufficient
to
smash
down
that
defensive
system
and
make
an
easy
way
through
for
the
infantry
they
were
wrong
in
spite
of
that
tornado
of
which
i
had
seen
tearing
up
the
earth
many
tunnels
were
still
unbroken
and
out
of
them
came
masses
of
german
and
riflemen
when
our
infantry
rose
from
their
own
trenches
on
that
morning
of
july
our
guns
had
shifted
their
barrage
forward
at
that
moment
farther
ahead
of
the
infantry
than
was
afterward
allowed
the
men
being
trained
to
follow
close
to
the
lines
of
bursting
shells
trained
to
expect
a
number
of
casualties
from
their
own
guns
it
needs
some
training
in
order
to
secure
the
general
safety
gained
by
keeping
the
enemy
below
ground
until
our
bayonets
were
round
his
dugouts
the
germans
had
been
trained
too
to
an
act
of
amazing
courage
their
discipline
that
immense
power
of
discipline
which
dominates
men
in
the
mass
was
strong
enough
to
make
them
obey
the
order
to
rush
through
that
barrage
of
ours
that
advancing
wall
of
explosion
and
if
they
lived
through
it
to
face
our
men
in
the
open
with
massed
fire
so
they
did
and
as
english
irish
scottish
and
welsh
battalions
of
our
assaulting
divisions
trudged
forward
over
what
had
been
no
man
land
bullets
sprayed
upon
them
and
they
fell
like
grass
to
the
scythe
line
after
line
of
men
followed
them
and
each
line
crumpled
and
only
small
groups
and
single
figures
seeking
comradeship
hurried
forward
german
were
bayoneted
as
their
thumbs
were
still
pressed
to
their
triggers
in
german
trenches
at
the
bottom
of
thiepval
wood
outside
beaumont
hamel
and
on
the
edge
of
gommecourt
park
the
men
who
came
out
of
their
dugouts
fought
fiercely
with
and
rifles
and
our
officers
and
men
in
places
where
they
had
strength
enough
clubbed
them
to
death
stuck
them
with
bayonets
and
blew
their
brains
out
with
revolvers
at
short
range
then
those
english
and
irish
and
scottish
troops
grievously
weak
because
of
all
the
dead
and
wounded
behind
them
struggled
through
to
the
second
german
line
from
which
there
came
a
still
fiercer
rattle
of
and
some
of
them
broke
through
that
line
too
and
went
ahead
in
isolated
parties
across
the
wild
crater
land
over
chasms
and
ditches
and
fallen
trees
toward
the
highest
ground
which
had
been
their
goal
nothing
was
seen
of
them
they
disappeared
into
clouds
of
smoke
and
flame
gunner
observers
saw
rockets
go
up
in
far
places
our
rockets
showing
that
outposts
had
penetrated
into
the
german
lines
runners
came
back
survivors
of
many
predecessors
who
had
fallen
on
the
way
with
scribbled
messages
from
company
officers
one
came
from
the
essex
and
king
own
of
the
division
at
a
place
called
pendant
copse
southeast
of
serre
for
god
sake
send
us
it
was
impossible
to
send
them
bombs
no
men
could
get
to
them
through
the
deep
barrage
of
which
was
between
them
and
our
supporting
troops
many
tried
and
died
the
ulster
men
went
forward
toward
beaumont
hamel
with
a
grim
valor
which
was
reckless
of
their
losses
beaumont
hamel
was
a
german
fortress
fire
raked
every
yard
of
the
ulster
way
hundreds
of
the
irish
fell
i
met
hundreds
of
them
wounded
tall
strong
powerful
men
from
queen
island
and
belfast
factories
and
tyneside
irish
and
tyneside
scots
they
gave
us
no
chance
said
one
of
them
a
they
just
murdered
but
bunches
of
them
went
right
into
the
heart
of
the
german
positions
and
then
found
behind
them
crowds
of
germans
who
had
come
up
out
of
their
tunnels
and
flung
bombs
at
them
only
a
few
came
back
alive
in
the
darkness
into
thiepval
wood
men
of
ours
smashed
their
way
through
the
german
trenches
not
counting
those
who
fell
and
killing
any
german
who
stood
in
their
way
inside
that
wood
of
dead
trees
and
charred
branches
they
reformed
astonished
at
the
fewness
of
their
numbers
germans
coming
up
from
holes
in
the
earth
attacked
them
and
they
held
firm
and
took
two
hundred
prisoners
other
germans
came
closing
in
like
wolves
in
packs
and
to
a
german
officer
who
said
surrender
our
men
shouted
no
surrender
and
fought
in
thiepval
wood
until
most
were
dead
and
only
a
few
wounded
crawled
out
to
tell
that
tale
the
londoners
of
the
division
had
no
luck
at
all
theirs
was
the
worst
luck
because
by
a
desperate
courage
in
assault
they
did
break
through
the
german
lines
at
gommecourt
their
left
was
held
by
the
london
rifle
brigade
the
rangers
and
the
queen
victoria
rifles
the
old
vics
formed
their
center
their
right
was
made
up
by
the
london
scottish
and
behind
came
the
queen
westminsters
and
the
kensingtons
who
were
to
advance
through
their
comrades
to
a
farther
objective
across
a
wide
no
man
land
they
suffered
from
the
bursting
of
heavy
crumps
and
many
fell
but
they
escaped
annihilation
by
fire
and
stormed
through
the
upheaved
earth
into
gommecourt
park
killing
many
germans
and
sending
back
batches
of
prisoners
they
had
done
what
they
had
been
asked
to
do
and
started
building
up
barricades
of
earth
and
and
then
found
they
were
in
a
there
were
no
troops
on
their
right
or
left
they
had
thrust
out
into
a
salient
which
presently
the
enemy
saw
the
german
gunners
with
deadly
skill
boxed
it
round
with
so
that
the
londoners
were
inclosed
by
explosive
walls
and
then
very
slowly
and
carefully
drew
a
line
of
bursting
shells
up
and
down
up
and
down
that
captured
ground
ravaging
its
earth
anew
and
smashing
the
life
that
crouched
there
london
life
i
have
written
elsewhere
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
how
young
officers
and
small
bodies
of
these
london
men
held
the
barricades
against
german
attacks
while
others
tried
to
break
a
way
back
through
that
murderous
and
how
groups
of
lads
who
set
out
on
that
adventure
to
their
old
lines
were
shattered
so
that
only
a
few
from
each
group
crawled
back
alive
wounded
or
unwounded
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
germans
acted
with
chivalry
which
i
was
not
allowed
to
tell
at
the
time
the
general
of
the
london
division
philip
howell
told
me
that
the
enemy
sent
over
a
message
by
a
airplane
proposing
a
truce
while
the
worked
and
offering
the
service
of
their
own
men
in
that
work
of
mercy
this
offer
was
accepted
without
reference
to
and
german
helped
to
carry
our
wounded
to
a
point
where
they
could
be
reached
many
in
spite
of
that
remained
lying
out
in
no
man
land
some
for
three
or
four
days
and
nights
i
met
one
man
who
lay
out
there
wounded
with
a
group
of
comrades
more
badly
hurt
than
he
was
until
july
at
night
he
crawled
over
to
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
took
their
and
iron
rations
and
so
brought
drink
and
food
to
his
stricken
friends
then
at
last
he
made
his
way
through
roving
shells
to
our
lines
and
even
then
asked
to
lead
the
who
volunteered
on
a
for
his
physical
courage
was
very
common
in
the
war
said
a
friend
of
mine
who
saw
nothing
of
war
it
is
proved
that
physical
courage
is
the
commonest
quality
of
mankind
as
moral
courage
is
the
but
that
courage
was
spiritual
and
there
were
many
like
him
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
and
in
other
later
battles
as
tragic
as
those
ix
i
have
told
how
before
the
big
push
as
we
called
the
beginning
of
these
battles
little
towns
of
tents
were
built
under
the
sign
of
the
red
cross
for
a
time
they
were
inhabited
only
by
medical
officers
nurses
and
orderlies
busily
getting
ready
for
a
sudden
invasion
and
spending
their
surplus
energy
which
seemed
inexhaustible
on
the
decoration
of
their
camps
by
paths
red
crosses
painted
on
canvas
or
built
up
in
red
and
white
chalk
on
leveled
earth
and
flowers
planted
outside
the
tents
all
very
pretty
and
picturesque
in
the
sunshine
and
the
breezes
over
the
valley
of
the
somme
on
the
morning
of
battle
the
doctors
nurses
and
orderlies
waited
for
their
patients
and
said
now
we
sha
be
long
they
were
merry
and
bright
with
that
wonderful
cheerfulness
which
enabled
them
to
face
the
tragedy
of
mangled
manhood
without
horror
and
almost
it
seemed
without
pity
because
it
was
their
work
and
they
were
there
to
heal
what
might
be
healed
it
was
with
a
rush
that
their
first
cases
came
and
the
whistled
and
said
ye
gods
how
many
more
many
more
the
tide
did
not
slacken
it
became
a
spate
brought
down
by
waves
of
ambulances
three
thousand
wounded
came
to
daours
on
the
somme
three
thousand
to
corbie
thousands
to
dernancourt
heilly
puchevillers
toutencourt
and
many
other
clearing
at
daours
the
tents
were
filled
to
overflowing
until
there
was
no
more
room
the
wounded
were
laid
down
on
the
grass
to
wait
their
turn
for
the
surgeon
knife
some
of
them
crawled
over
to
haycocks
and
covered
themselves
with
hay
and
went
to
sleep
as
i
saw
them
sleeping
there
like
dead
men
here
and
there
boys
sat
weeping
or
moaning
and
shaking
with
an
ague
most
of
the
wounded
were
quiet
and
did
not
give
any
groan
or
moan
the
lightly
wounded
sat
in
groups
telling
their
adventures
cursing
the
german
young
officers
spoke
in
a
different
way
and
with
that
sporting
spirit
which
they
had
learned
in
public
schools
praised
their
enemy
the
are
wonderful
fellows
topping
fight
until
killed
they
gave
us
each
man
among
those
thousands
of
wounded
had
escaped
death
a
dozen
times
or
more
by
the
merest
flukes
of
luck
it
was
this
luck
of
theirs
which
they
hugged
with
a
kind
of
laughing
excitement
it
a
marvel
i
here
that
shell
burst
all
round
me
killed
six
of
my
pals
i
got
through
with
a
blighty
wound
no
bones
broken
god
what
luck
the
death
of
other
men
did
not
grieve
them
they
could
not
waste
this
sense
of
luck
in
pity
the
escape
of
their
own
individuality
this
possession
of
life
was
a
glorious
thought
they
were
alive
what
luck
what
luck
we
called
the
hospital
at
corbie
the
butcher
it
was
in
a
pretty
spot
in
that
little
town
with
a
big
church
whose
tall
white
towers
looked
down
a
broad
sweep
of
the
somme
so
that
for
miles
they
were
a
landmark
behind
the
battlefields
behind
the
lines
during
those
first
battles
but
later
in
when
the
enemy
came
nearly
to
the
gates
of
amiens
a
stronghold
of
the
australians
who
garrisoned
it
and
sniped
pigeons
for
their
pots
off
the
top
of
the
towers
and
took
no
great
notice
of
which
broke
through
the
roofs
of
cottages
and
barns
it
was
a
safe
snug
place
in
july
of
but
that
shop
at
a
corner
of
the
square
was
not
a
pretty
spot
after
a
visit
there
i
had
to
wipe
cold
sweat
from
my
forehead
and
found
myself
trembling
in
a
queer
way
it
was
the
medical
officer
a
colonel
who
called
it
that
name
this
is
our
butcher
shop
he
said
cheerily
come
and
have
a
look
at
my
cases
they
the
worst
possible
stomach
wounds
compound
fractures
and
all
that
we
lop
off
limbs
here
all
day
long
and
all
night
you
no
idea
i
had
no
idea
but
i
did
not
wish
to
see
its
reality
the
could
not
understand
my
reluctance
to
see
his
show
he
put
it
down
to
my
desire
to
save
his
time
and
explained
that
he
was
going
the
rounds
and
would
take
it
as
a
favor
if
i
would
walk
with
him
i
yielded
weakly
and
cursed
myself
for
not
taking
to
flight
yet
i
argued
what
men
are
brave
enough
to
suffer
i
ought
to
have
the
courage
to
see
i
saw
and
sickened
these
were
the
victims
of
victory
and
the
red
fruit
of
a
new
batch
of
cases
had
just
arrived
more
were
being
brought
in
on
stretchers
they
were
laid
down
in
rows
on
the
the
colonel
bent
down
to
some
of
them
and
drew
their
blankets
back
and
now
and
then
felt
a
man
pulse
most
of
them
were
unconscious
breathing
with
the
hard
snuffle
of
dying
men
their
skin
was
already
darkening
to
the
which
is
not
white
they
were
all
plastered
with
a
gray
clay
and
this
mud
on
their
faces
was
in
some
cases
mixed
with
thick
clots
of
blood
making
a
hard
incrustation
from
scalp
to
chin
that
fellow
wo
last
long
said
the
rising
from
a
stretcher
hardly
a
left
in
him
sure
to
die
on
the
if
he
gets
as
far
as
that
step
back
against
the
wall
a
minute
will
you
we
flattened
ourselves
against
the
passage
wall
while
brought
in
a
line
of
stretchers
no
sound
came
from
most
of
those
bundles
under
the
blankets
but
from
one
came
a
long
agonizing
wail
the
cry
of
an
animal
in
torture
come
through
the
wards
said
the
colonel
they
pretty
bright
though
we
could
do
with
more
space
and
in
one
long
narrow
room
there
were
about
thirty
beds
and
in
each
bed
lay
a
young
british
soldier
or
part
of
a
young
british
soldier
there
was
not
much
left
of
one
of
them
both
his
legs
had
been
amputated
to
the
thigh
and
both
his
arms
to
the
remarkable
man
that
said
the
colonel
simply
refuses
to
die
his
vitality
is
so
tremendous
that
it
is
putting
up
a
terrific
fight
against
mortality
there
another
case
of
the
same
kind
one
leg
gone
and
the
other
going
and
one
arm
deliberate
refusal
to
give
in
not
going
to
kill
me
doctor
he
said
going
to
stick
it
through
what
spirit
eh
i
spoke
to
that
man
he
was
quite
conscious
with
bright
eyes
his
right
leg
was
uncovered
and
supported
on
a
board
hung
from
the
ceiling
its
flesh
was
like
that
of
a
chicken
badly
flabby
and
in
tatters
he
thought
i
was
a
surgeon
and
spoke
to
me
pleadingly
i
guess
you
can
save
that
leg
sir
it
doing
fine
i
should
hate
to
lose
i
murmured
something
about
a
chance
for
it
and
the
broke
in
cheerfully
you
wo
lose
it
if
i
can
help
it
how
your
pulse
oh
not
bad
keep
cheerful
and
we
pull
you
the
man
smiled
gallantly
bound
to
come
off
said
the
doctor
as
we
passed
to
another
bed
gas
gangrene
that
the
thing
that
does
us
in
bed
after
bed
i
saw
men
of
ours
very
young
men
who
had
been
lopped
of
limbs
a
few
hours
ago
or
a
few
minutes
some
of
them
unconscious
some
of
them
strangely
and
terribly
conscious
with
a
look
in
their
eyes
as
though
staring
at
the
death
which
sat
near
to
them
and
edged
nearer
yes
said
the
they
look
bad
some
of
but
youth
is
on
their
side
i
dare
say
per
cent
will
get
through
if
it
was
for
gas
gangrene
he
jerked
his
head
to
a
boy
sitting
up
in
bed
smiling
at
the
nurse
who
felt
his
pulse
looks
fairly
fit
after
the
knife
does
he
but
we
shall
have
to
cut
higher
up
the
gas
again
i
afraid
he
be
dead
before
come
into
the
it
very
well
i
refused
that
invitation
i
walked
stiffly
out
of
the
butcher
shop
of
corbie
past
the
man
who
had
lost
both
arms
and
both
legs
that
vital
trunk
past
rows
of
men
lying
under
blankets
past
a
stench
of
mud
and
blood
and
anesthetics
to
the
fresh
air
of
the
gateway
where
a
column
of
ambulances
had
just
arrived
with
a
new
harvest
from
the
fields
of
the
somme
come
in
again
any
time
shouted
out
the
cheery
colonel
waving
his
hand
i
never
went
again
though
i
saw
many
other
butcher
shops
in
the
years
that
followed
where
there
was
a
great
carving
of
human
flesh
which
was
of
our
boyhood
while
the
old
men
directed
their
sacrifice
and
the
profiteers
grew
rich
and
the
fires
of
hate
were
stoked
up
at
patriotic
banquets
and
in
editorial
chairs
x
the
failure
on
the
left
hardly
balanced
by
the
partial
success
on
the
right
caused
a
sudden
pause
in
the
operations
camouflaged
by
small
attacks
on
minor
positions
around
and
above
fricourt
and
mametz
the
lincolns
and
others
went
over
to
fricourt
wood
and
routed
out

the
sunken
road
at
fricourt
the
dorsets
manchesters

lancashire
fusiliers
and
borderers
of
the
division
were
in
possession
of

were

on

desperate
valor
the

northumberland
fusiliers
durhams
making
a
flanking
attack
on
contalmaison
but
weakened
after
their
heavy
losses
on
the
first
day
of
battle
the
fighting
for
a
time
was
local
in
small
copses
lozenge
wood
peak
wood
caterpillar
wood
acid
drop
copse
where
english
and
german
troops
fought
ferociously
for
yards
of
ground
hummocks
of
earth
ditches
had
been
shocked
by
the
disaster
on
the
left
and
the
failure
of
all
the
big
hopes
they
had
held
for
a
on
both
sides
of
the
german
positions
rumors
came
to
us
that
the
had
decided
to
restrict
future
operations
to
minor
actions
for
strengthening
the
line
and
to
abandon
the
great
offensive
it
was
believed
by
officers
i
met
that
sir
henry
rawlinson
was
arguing
persuading
in
favor
of
continued
assaults
on
the
grand
scale
whatever
division
of
opinion
existed
in
the
high
command
i
do
not
know
it
was
visible
to
all
of
us
that
for
some
days
there
were
uncertainty
of
direction
hesitation
conflicting
orders
on
july
the
division
under
general
pilcher
attacked
contalmaison
and
a
whole
battalion
of
the
prussian
guard
hurried
up
from
valenciennes
and
thrown
on
to
the
battlefield
without
maps
or
guidance
walked
into
the
barrage
which
covered
the
advance
of
our
men
and
were
almost
annihilated
but
although
some
bodies
of
our
men
entered
contalmaison
in
an
attack
which
i
was
able
to
see
they
were
smashed
out
of
it
again
by
storms
of
fire
followed
by
masses
of
men
who
poured
out
from
mametz
wood
the
welsh
were
attacking
mametz
wood
they
were
handled
as
marbot
said
of
his
men
in
a
napoleonic
battle
like
battalion
commanders
received
orders
in
direct
conflict
with
one
another
bodies
of
welshmen
were
advanced
and
then
retired
and
left
to
lie
nakedly
without
cover
under
dreadful
fire
the
division
under
general
pilcher
did
not
attack
at
the
expected
time
there
was
no
of
divisions
no
knowledge
among
battalion
officers
of
the
strategy
or
tactics
of
a
battle
in
which
their
men
were
involved
goodness
knows
what
happening
said
an
officer
i
met
near
mametz
he
had
been
waiting
all
night
and
half
a
day
with
a
body
of
troops
who
had
expected
to
go
forward
and
were
still
hanging
about
under
harassing
fire
on
july
contalmaison
was
taken
i
saw
that
attack
very
clearly
so
clearly
that
i
could
almost
count
the
bricks
in
the
old
chateau
set
in
a
little
wood
and
saw
the
tower
knocked
off
by
the
direct
hit
of
a
shell
at
four
in
the
afternoon
our
guns
concentrated
on
the
village
and
under
the
cover
of
that
fire
our
men
advanced
on
three
sides
of
it
hemmed
it
in
and
captured
it
with
the
garrison
of
the
bavarian
regiment
who
had
suffered
the
agonies
of
hell
inside
its
ruins
now
our
men
stayed
in
the
ruins
and
this
time
german
shells
smashed
into
the
chateau
and
the
cottages
and
left
nothing
but
rubbish
heaps
of
brick
through
which
a
few
days
later
i
went
walking
with
the
smell
of
death
in
my
nostrils
our
men
were
now
being
shelled
in
that
place
beyond
la
boisselle
on
the
left
of
the
road
there
had
been
a
village
called
ovillers
it
was
no
longer
there
our
guns
has
removed
every
trace
of
it
except
as
it
lay
in
heaps
of
pounded
brick
the
germans
had
a
network
of
trenches
about
it
and
in
their
ditches
and
their
dugouts
they
fought
like
wolves
our
division
was
ordered
to
drive
them
out
a
division
of
english
county
troops
including
the
sussex
essex
bedfords
and
middlesex
and
those
country
boys
of
ours
fought
their
way
among
communication
trenches
burrowed
into
tunnels
crouched
below
hummocks
of
earth
and
brick
and
with
bombs
and
bayonets
and
broken
rifles
and
boulders
of
stone
and
german
and
any
weapon
that
would
kill
gained

by
yard
over
the
dead
bodies
of
the
enemy
or
by
the
capture
of
small
batches
of
cornered
men
until
after
seventeen
days
of
this
one
hundred
and
forty
men
of
the
prussian
guard
the
last
of
their
garrison
without
food
or
water
raised
a
signal
of
surrender
and
came
out
with
their
hands
up
ovillers
was
a
shambles
in
a
fight
of
primitive
like
human
beasts
yet
our
men
were
not
they
came
out
from
those
places
if
they
had
the
luck
to
come
out
apparently
unchanged
without
any
mark
of
the
beast
on
them
and
when
they
cleansed
themselves
of
mud
and
filth
boiled
the
lice
out
of
their
shirts
and
assembled
in
a
village
street
behind
the
lines
they
whistled
laughed
gossiped
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
their
souls
though
something
had
really
happened
as
now
we
know
it
was
not
until
july
that
our
high
command
ordered
another
general
attack
after
the
local
fighting
which
had
been
in
progress
since
the
first
day
of
battle
our
and
some
of
our
heavies
had
moved
forward
to
places
like
montauban
and
contalmaison
where
german
shells
came
searching
for
them
all
day
long
and
new
divisions
had
been
brought
up
to
relieve
some
of
the
men
who
had
been
fighting
so
hard
and
so
long
it
was
to
be
an
attack
on
the
second
german
line
of
defense
on
the
ridges
by
the
village
of
bazentin
le
grand
and
bazentin
le
petit
to
longueval
on
the
right
and
delville
wood
i
went
up
in
the
night
to
see
the
bombardment
and
the
beginning
of
the
battle
and
the
swirl
of
its
backwash
and
i
remember
now
the
darkness
of
villages
behind
the
lines
through
which
our
cars
crawled
until
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
and
saw
the
sky
rent
by
incessant
flames
of
while
red
tongues
of
flames
leaped
up
from
burning
villages
longueval
was
on
fire
and
the
two
bazentins
and
another
belt
of
land
in
france
so
beautiful
to
see
even
as
i
had
seen
it
first
between
the
of
our
parapets
was
being
delivered
to
the
i
have
described
that
night
scene
elsewhere
in
all
its
deviltry
but
one
picture
which
i
passed
on
the
way
to
the
battlefield
could
not
then
be
told
yet
it
was
significant
of
the
mentality
of
our
high
command
as
was
afterward
pointed
out
derisively
by
sixte
von
arnim
it
proved
the
strange
unreasoning
optimism
which
still
lingered
in
the
breasts
of
generals
in
spite
of
what
had
happened
on
the
left
on
the
first
day
of
july
and
their
study
of
trench
maps
and
their
knowledge
of
german
by
an
old
called
the
moulin
vivier
outside
the
village
of
meaulte
were
masses
of
cavalry
indian
cavalry
and
dragoons
drawn
up
densely
to
leave
a
narrow
passageway
for
and
moving
through
the
village
which
was
in
utter
darkness
the
indians
sat
like
statues
on
their
horses
motionless
dead
silent
now
and
again
there
was
a
jangle
of
bits
here
and
there
a
british
soldier
lit
a
cigarette
and
for
a
second
the
little
flame
of
his
match
revealed
a
bronzed
face
or
glinted
on
steel
helmets
cavalry
so
even
now
there
was
a
serious
purpose
behind
the
joke
of
english
soldiers
who
had
gone
forward
on
the
first
day
shouting
this
way
to
the
gap
and
in
the
conversation
of
some
of
those
who
actually
did
ride
through
bazentin
that
day
a
troop
or
two
made
their
way
over
the
cratered
ground
and
skirted
delville
wood
the
dragoon
guards
charged
a
in
a
cornfield
and
killed
the
gunners
germans
rounded
up
by
them
clung
to
their
stirrup
leathers
crying
pity
pity
the
indians
lowered
their
lances
but
took
prisoners
to
show
their
chivalry
but
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
beau
geste
it
was
as
futile
and
absurd
as
don
quixote
charge
of
the
windmill
they
were
brought
to
a
dead
halt
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
fire
which
killed
their
horses
and
lay
out
that
night
with
german
shells
searching
for
their
bodies
one
of
the
most
disappointed
men
in
the
army
was
on
general
staff
he
was
an
old
cavalry
officer
and
this
major
of
the
old
old
school
belonging
in
spirit
to
the
time
of
charles
lever
was
excited
by
the
thought
that
there
was
to
be
a
cavalry
adventure
he
was
one
of
those
who
swore
that
if
he
had
his
chance
he
would
ride
into
the
it
was
the
chance
he
wanted
and
he
nursed
his
way
to
it
by
delicate
attentions
to
general
haldane
the
general
bed
was
not
so
comfortable
as
his
he
changed
places
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
put
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
the
general
table
in
his
dugout
you
seem
very
attentive
to
me
major
said
the
general
smelling
a
rat
then
the
major
blurted
out
his
desire
could
he
lead
a
squadron
round
delville
wood
could
he
take
that
ride
into
the
blue
he
would
give
his
soul
to
do
it
get
on
with
your
job
said
general
haldane
that
ride
into
the
blue
did
not
encourage
the
cavalry
to
the
belief
that
they
would
be
of
real
value
in
a
warfare
of
trench
lines
and
barbed
wire
but
for
a
long
time
later
they
were
kept
moving
backward
and
forward
between
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
and
the
back
areas
to
the
great
incumbrance
of
the
roads
until
they
were
guyed
by
the
infantry
and
irritable
so
their
officers
told
me
to
the
verge
of
mutiny
their
irritability
was
cured
by
dismounting
them
for
a
turn
in
the
trenches
and
i
came
across
the
household
cavalry
digging
by
the
coniston
steps
this
side
of
thiepval
and
cursing
their
in
this
book
i
will
not
tell
again
the
narrative
of
that
fighting
in
the
summer
and
autumn
of
which
i
have
written
with
many
details
of
each
day
scene
in
my
collected
despatches
called
the
battles
of
the
somme
there
is
little
that
i
can
add
to
those
which
i
wrote
day
by
day
after
haunting
experiences
amid
the
ruin
of
those
fields
except
a
of
their
effect
upon
the
mentality
of
our
men
and
upon
the
germans
who
were
in
the
same
as
they
called
it
and
a
closer
analysis
of
the
direction
and
mechanism
of
our
military
machine
looking
back
upon
those
battles
in
the
light
of
knowledge
gained
in
the
years
that
followed
it
seems
clear
that
our
high
command
was
too
prodigal
in
its
expenditure
of
life
in
small
sectional
battles
and
that
the
army
corps
and
divisional
staffs
had
not
established
an
efficient
system
of
communication
with
the
fighting
units
under
their
control
it
seemed
to
an
outsider
like
myself
that
a
number
of
separate
battles
were
being
fought
without
reference
to
one
another
in
different
parts
of
the
field
it
seemed
as
though
our
generals
after
conferring
with
one
another
over
telephones
said
all
right
tell
to
have
a
go
at
thiepval
or
we
will
send
a
division
to
capture
delville
wood
or
we
must
get
that
line
of
trenches
outside
orders
were
drawn
up
on
the
basis
of
that
decision
and
passed
down
to
brigades
who
read
them
as
their
sentence
of
death
and
obeyed
with
or
without
protest
and
sent
three
or
four
battalions
to
assault
a
place
which
was
covered
by
german
batteries
round
an
arc
of
twenty
miles
ready
to
open
out
a
tempest
of
fire
directly
a
rocket
rose
from
their
infantry
and
to
tear
up
the
woods
and
earth
in
that
neighborhood
if
our
men
gained
ground
if
the
whole
moved
forward
the
german
fire
would
have
been
dispersed
but
in
these
separate
attacks
on
places
like
trones
wood
and
delville
wood
and
later
on
high
wood
it
was
a
vast
concentration
of
explosives
which
plowed
up
our
men
so
it
was
that
delville
wood
was
captured
and
lost
several
times
and
became
devil
wood
to
men
who
lay
there
under
the
crash
and
fury
of
massed
until
a
wretched
remnant
of
what
had
been
a
glorious
brigade
of
youth
crawled
out
stricken
and
bleeding
when
relieved
by
another
brigade
ordered
to
take
their
turn
in
that
devil
caldron
or
to
recapture
it
when
german
and
had
followed
in
the
wake
of
fire
and
had
crouched
again
among
the
fallen
trees
and
in
the
and
ditches
with
our
dead
and
their
dead
to
keep
them
company
in
delville
wood
the
south
african
brigade
of
the
division
was
cut
to
pieces
and
i
saw
the
survivors
come
out
with
few
officers
to
lead
them
in
trones
wood
in
bernafay
wood
in
mametz
wood
there
had
been
great
slaughter
of
english
troops
and
welsh
the
division
and
the
suffered
horribly
in
delville
wood
many
battalions
were
slashed
to
pieces
before
these
south
africans
and
after
that
came
high
all
that
was
left
of
high
wood
in
the
autumn
of
was
a
thin
row
of
branchless
trees
but
in
july
and
august
there
were
still
glades
under
heavy
foliage
until
the
branches
were
lopped
off
and
the
leaves
scattered
by
our
incessant
fire
it
was
an
important
position
vital
for
the
enemy
defense
and
our
attack
on
the
right
flank
of
the
pozieres
ridge
above
bazentin
and
delville
wood
giving
on
the
reverse
slope
a
fine
observation
of
the
enemy
lines
above
martinpuich
and
courcellette
away
to
bapaume
for
that
reason
the
germans
were
ordered
to
hold
it
at
all
costs
and
many
german
batteries
had
registered
on
it
to
blast
our
men
out
if
they
gained
a
foothold
on
our
side
of
the
slope
or
theirs
so
high
wood
became
another
hell
on
a
day
of
great
battle
september
when
for
the
first
time
tanks
were
used
demoralizing
the
enemy
in
certain
places
though
they
were
too
few
in
number
to
strike
a
paralyzing
blow
the
londoners
gained
part
of
high
wood
at
frightful
cost
and
then
were
blown
out
of
it
other
divisions
followed
them
and
found
the
wood
stuffed
with
which
they
had
to
capture
through
hurricanes
of
bullets
before
they
crouched
in
craters
amid
dead
germans
and
dead
english
and
then
were
blown
out
like
the
londoners
under
in
which
no
human
life
could
stay
for
long
the
division
was
cut
up
there
the
division
lost
six
thousand
men
in
an
advance
against
uncut
wire
in
the
wood
which
they
were
told
was
already
captured
hundreds
of
men
were
vomiting
from
the
effect
of
choking
and
blinded
behind
the
transport
wagons
and
horses
were
smashed
to
bits
the
divisional
staffs
were
often
ignorant
of
what
was
happening
to
the
when
the
attack
was
launched
light
signals
rockets
heliographing
were
of
small
avail
through
the
dust
and
forward
observing
officers
crouching
behind
parapets
as
i
often
saw
them
and
sometimes
stood
with
them
watched
fires
burning
red
rockets
and
green
gusts
of
flame
and
bursting
shells
and
were
doubtful
what
to
make
of
it
all
telephone
wires
trailed
across
the
ground
for
miles
were
cut
into
short
lengths
by
shrapnel
and
high
explosive
accidents
happened
as
part
of
the
inevitable
blunders
of
war
it
was
all
a
vast
tangle
and
complexity
of
strife
on
july
i
stood
in
a
tent
by
a
who
was
directing
a
group
of
heavy
guns
supporting
the
division
he
was
tired
as
i
could
see
by
the
black
lines
under
his
eyes
and
tightly
drawn
lips
on
a
in
front
of
him
upon
which
he
leaned
his
elbows
there
was
a
telephone
apparatus
and
the
little
bell
kept
ringing
as
we
talked
now
and
then
a
shell
burst
in
the
field
outside
the
tent
and
he
raised
his
head
and
said
they
keep
crumping
about
here
hope
they
wo
tear
this
tent
to
ribbons
sounds
like
a
then
he
turned
to
the
telephone
again
and
listened
to
some
voice
speaking
yes
i
can
hear
you
yes
go
on
men
seen
leaving
high
wood
yes
by
our
artillery
are
you
sure
of
that
i
say
are
you
sure
they
were
our
men
another
message
well
carry
on
digging
on
road
from
high
wood
southeast
to
longueval
yes
i
got
that
are
our
men
and
not
boches
oh
hell
get
off
the
line
get
off
the
line
ca
you
men
and
not
boches
yes
i
have
that
shelled
by
our
guns
the
tapped
on
the
table
with
a
a
tattoo
while
his
forehead
puckered
then
he
spoke
into
the
telephone
again
are
you
there
well
do
disturb
those
fellows
for
half
an
hour
after
that
i
will
give
you
new
orders
try
and
confirm
if
they
are
our
he
rang
off
and
turned
to
me
that
the
trouble
looks
as
if
we
had
been
pounding
our
own
men
like
hell
some
damn
fool
reports
gives
the
reference
number
asks
for
the
then
some
other
fellow
says
boches
for
sake
cease
fire
how
is
one
to
tell
i
could
not
answer
that
question
but
i
hated
the
idea
of
our
men
sent
forward
to
capture
a
road
or
a
trench
or
a
wood
and
then
pounded
by
our
guns
they
had
enough
pounding
from
the
enemy
guns
there
seemed
a
missing
link
in
the
system
somewhere
probably
it
was
quite
inevitable
over
and
over
again
the
wounded
swore
to
god
that
they
had
been
shelled
by
our
own
guns
the
londoners
said
so
from
high
wood
the
australians
said
so
from
mouquet
farm
the
scots
said
so
from
longueval
they
said
why
the
hell
do
we
get
murdered
by
british
gunners
what
the
good
of
fighting
if
we
slaughtered
by
our
own
side
in
some
cases
they
were
mistaken
it
was
enfilade
fire
from
german
batteries
but
often
it
happened
according
to
the
way
of
that
telephone
conversation
in
the
tent
by
bronfay
farm
the
difference
between
british
soldiers
and
german
soldiers
crawling
over
or
crouching
below
the
banks
of
a
sunken
road
was
no
more
than
the
difference
between
two
tribes
of
ants
our
flying
scouts
however
low
they
flew
risking
the
archies
and
bullets
often
mistook
khaki
for
field
gray
and
came
back
with
false
reports
which
led
to
tragedy
xi
people
who
read
my
war
despatches
will
remember
my
first
descriptions
of
the
tanks
and
those
of
other
correspondents
they
caused
a
sensation
a
sense
of
excitement
laughter
which
shook
the
nation
because
of
the
comicality
the
grotesque
surprise
the
possibility
of
quicker
victory
which
caught
hold
of
the
imagination
of
people
who
heard
for
the
first
time
of
those
new
engines
of
war
so
in
appearance
and
performance
the
vagueness
of
our
descriptions
was
due
to
the
censorship
which
forbade
wisely
enough
any
technical
and
exact
definition
so
that
we
had
to
compare
them
to
giant
toads
mammoths
and
prehistoric
animals
of
all
kinds
our
accounts
did
however
reproduce
the
psychological
effect
of
the
tanks
upon
the
british
troops
when
these
engines
appeared
for
the
first
time
to
their
astonished
gaze
on
september
our
soldiers
roared
with
laughter
as
i
did
when
they
saw
them
lolloping
up
the
roads
on
the
morning
of
the
great
battle
of
september
the
presence
of
the
tanks
going
into
action
excited
all
the
troops
along
the
front
with
a
sense
of
comical
relief
in
the
midst
of
the
grim
and
deadly
business
of
attack
men
followed
them
laughing
and
cheering
there
was
a
wonderful
thrill
in
the
airman
message
tank
walking
up
the
high
street
of
flers
with
the
british
army
cheering
wounded
boys
whom
i
met
that
morning
grinned
in
spite
of
their
wounds
at
our
first
word
about
the
tanks
crikey
said
a
cockney
lad
of
the
division
i
ca
help
laughing
every
time
i
think
of
them
tanks
i
saw
them
stamping
down
german
as
though
they
were
wasps
the
adventures
of
creme
de
menthe
cordon
rouge
and
the
byng
boys
on
both
sides
of
the
bapaume
road
when
they
smashed
down
barbed
wire
climbed
over
trenches
sat
on
german
redoubts
and
received
the
surrender
of
german
prisoners
who
held
their
hands
up
to
these
monsters
and
cried
kamerad
were
like
of
war
by
wells
yet
their
romance
had
a
sharp
edge
of
reality
as
i
saw
in
those
battles
of
the
somme
and
afterward
more
grievously
in
the
cambrai
salient
and
flanders
when
the
tanks
were
put
out
of
action
by
direct
hits
of
and
nothing
of
humankind
remained
in
them
but
the
charred
bones
of
their
gallant
crews
before
the
battle
in
september
of
i
talked
with
the
pilots
of
the
first
tanks
and
although
they
were
convinced
of
the
value
of
these
new
engines
of
war
and
were
out
to
prove
it
they
did
not
disguise
from
me
nor
from
their
own
souls
that
they
were
going
forth
upon
a
perilous
adventure
with
the
odds
of
luck
against
them
i
remember
one
young
pilot
a
tiny
fellow
like
a
jockey
who
took
me
on
one
side
and
said
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
and
then
scribbled
down
his
mother
address
and
asked
me
to
write
to
her
if
anything
happened
to
him
he
and
other
tank
officers
were
anxious
they
had
not
complete
confidence
in
the
steering
and
control
of
their
engines
it
was
a
difficult
and
clumsy
kind
of
gear
which
was
apt
to
break
down
at
a
critical
moment
as
i
saw
when
i
rode
in
one
on
their
field
of
maneuver
these
first
tanks
were
only
experimental
and
the
tail
arrangement
was
very
weak
worse
than
all
mechanical
troubles
was
the
policy
of
some
authority
at
who
had
insisted
upon
drivers
being
put
to
this
job
a
few
days
before
the
battle
without
proper
training
it
is
mad
and
murderous
said
one
of
the
officers
these
fellows
may
have
pluck
all
right
i
do
doubt
it
but
they
do
know
their
engines
nor
the
double
steering
trick
and
they
have
never
been
under
it
is
asking
for
as
it
turned
out
the
drivers
proved
their
pluck
for
the
most
part
splendidly
but
many
tanks
broke
down
before
they
reached
the
enemy
lines
and
in
that
action
and
later
battles
there
were
times
when
they
bitterly
disappointed
the
infantry
commanders
and
the
troops
individual
tanks
commanded
by
gallant
young
officers
and
served
by
brave
crews
did
astounding
feats
and
some
of
these
men
came
back
dazed
and
deaf
and
dumb
after
forty
hours
or
more
of
fighting
and
maneuvering
within
steel
walls
intensely
hot
filled
with
the
fumes
of
their
engines
jolted
and
banged
about
over
rough
ground
and
steering
an
uncertain
course
after
the
loss
of
their
tails
which
had
snapped
at
the
spine
but
there
had
not
been
anything
like
enough
tanks
to
secure
an
annihilating
surprise
over
the
enemy
as
afterward
was
attained
in
the
first
battle
of
cambrai
and
the
troops
who
had
been
buoyed
up
with
the
hope
that
at
last
the
machine
gun
evil
was
going
to
be
scotched
were
disillusioned
and
dejected
when
they
saw
tanks
ditched
behind
the
lines
or
nowhere
in
sight
when
once
again
they
had
to
trudge
forward
under
the
flail
of
bullets
from
earthwork
redoubts
it
was
a
failure
in
generalship
to
give
away
our
secret
before
it
could
be
made
effective
i
remember
sitting
in
a
mess
of
the
gordons
in
the
village
of
franvillers
along
the
albert
road
and
listening
to
a
long
monologue
by
a
gordon
officer
on
the
future
of
the
tanks
he
was
a
dreamer
and
visionary
and
his
laughed
at
him
a
few
tanks
are
no
good
he
said
forty
or
fifty
tanks
are
no
good
on
a
modern
we
want
hundreds
of
tanks
brought
up
secretly
fed
with
ammunition
by
tank
carriers
bringing
up
and
going
into
action
without
any
preliminary
barrage
they
can
smash
through
the
enemy
wire
and
get
over
his
trenches
before
he
is
aware
that
an
attack
has
been
organized
up
to
now
all
our
offensives
have
been
futile
because
of
our
preliminary
advertisement
by
prolonged
bombardment
the
tanks
can
bring
back
surprise
to
modern
warfare
but
we
must
have
hundreds
of
prolonged
laughter
greeted
this
speech
but
the
celtic
dreamer
did
not
smile
he
was
staring
into
the
future
and
what
he
saw
was
true
though
he
did
not
live
to
see
it
for
in
the
cambrai
battle
of
november
the
tanks
did
advance
in
hundreds
and
gained
an
enormous
surprise
over
the
enemy
and
led
the
way
to
a
striking
victory
which
turned
to
tragedy
because
of
risks
too
lightly
taken
xii
one
branch
of
our
military
machine
developed
with
astonishing
rapidity
and
skill
during
those
somme
battles
the
young
gentlemen
of
the
air
force
went
all
out
for
victory
and
were
reckless
in
audacity
how
far
they
acted
under
orders
and
against
their
own
judgment
of
what
was
sensible
and
sound
in
i
do
not
know
general
trenchard
their
supreme
chief
believed
in
an
aggressive
policy
at
all
costs
and
was
a
napoleon
in
this
war
of
the
skies
intolerant
of
timidity
not
squeamish
of
heavy
losses
if
the
balance
were
tipped
against
the
enemy
some
young
complained
to
me
bitterly
that
they
were
expected
to
fly
or
die
over
the
german
lines
whatever
the
weather
or
whatever
the
risks
many
of
them
after
repeated
escapes
from
shells
and
hostile
craft
lost
their
nerve
shirked
another
journey
found
themselves
crying
in
their
tents
and
were
sent
back
home
for
a
spell
by
squadron
commanders
with
quick
observation
for
the
or
made
a
few
more
flights
and
fell
to
earth
like
broken
birds
sooner
or
later
apart
from
rare
cases
every
man
was
found
to
lose
his
nerve
unless
he
lost
his
life
first
that
was
a
physical
and
mental
law
but
until
that
time
these
were
the
of
the
war
and
most
of
them
did
not
need
any
driving
to
the
risks
they
took
with
boyish
recklessness
they
were
mostly
boys
babes
as
they
seemed
to
me
when
i
saw
them
in
their
tents
or
dismounting
from
their
machines
on
dud
days
when
there
was
no
visibility
at
all
they
spent
their
leisure
hours
to
amiens
or
some
other
town
where
they
could
have
a
they
drank
many
cocktails
and
roared
with
laughter
over
bottles
of
cheap
champagne
and
flirted
with
any
girl
who
happened
to
come
within
their
orbit
if
not
allowed
beyond
their
tents
they
sulked
like
baby
achilles
reading
novelettes
with
their
knees
hunched
up
playing
the
gramophone
and
ragging
each
other
there
was
one
child
so
young
that
his
squadron
leader
would
not
let
him
go
out
across
the
to
challenge
any
german
scout
in
the
clouds
or
do
any
of
the
fancy
stunts
that
were
part
of
the
next
day
program
he
went
to
bed
sulkily
and
then
came
back
again
in
his
pajamas
with
rumpled
hair
look
here
sir
he
said
ca
i
go
i
got
my
wings
perfectly
rotten
being
left
the
squadron
commander
who
told
me
of
the
tale
yielded
all
right
only
do
do
any
fool
next
morning
the
boy
flew
off
played
a
lone
hand
chased
a
german
scout
dropped
low
over
the
enemy
lines
infantry
on
the
march
scattered
them
bombed
a
train
chased
a
german
and
after
many
adventures
came
back
alive
and
said
i
had
a
rare
old
time
on
a
stormy
day
which
loosened
the
tent
poles
and
slapped
the
wet
canvas
i
sat
in
a
mess
with
a
group
of
drinking
tea
out
of
a
tin
mug
one
boy
the
youngest
of
them
had
just
brought
down
his
first
he
told
me
the
tale
of
it
with
many
details
his
eyes
alight
as
he
described
the
fight
they
had
maneuvered
round
each
other
for
a
long
time
then
he
shot
his
man
en
passant
the
machine
crashed
on
our
side
of
the
lines
he
had
taken
off
the
iron
crosses
on
the
wings
and
a
bit
of
the
propeller
as
mementoes
he
showed
me
these
things
while
the
squadron
commander
who
had
brought
down
germans
winked
at
me
and
told
me
he
was
going
to
send
them
home
to
hang
beside
his
college
trophies
i
guessed
he
was
less
than
nineteen
years
old
such
a
kid
a
few
days
later
when
i
went
to
the
tent
again
i
asked
about
him
how
that
boy
who
brought
down
his
first
the
squadron
commander
said
did
you
hear
he
gone
west
brought
down
in
a
he
had
a
chance
of
escape
but
went
back
to
rescue
a
pal
a
nice
they
became
fatalists
after
a
few
fights
and
believed
in
their
luck
or
their
mascots
a
bullet
that
had
missed
them
china
dolls
a
girl
lock
of
hair
a
silver
ring
yet
at
the
back
of
their
brains
most
of
them
i
fancy
knew
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
before
they
went
west
and
with
that
subconscious
thought
they
crowded
in
all
life
intensely
in
the
hours
that
were
given
to
them
seized
all
chance
of
laughter
of
wine
of
every
kind
of
pleasure
within
reach
and
said
their
prayers
some
of
them
with
great
fervor
between
one
escape
and
another
like
young
paul
bensher
who
has
revealed
his
soul
in
verse
his
secret
terror
his
tears
his
hatred
of
death
his
love
of
life
when
he
went
bombing
over
bruges
on
the
mornings
of
the
battles
of
the
somme
i
saw
them
as
the
heralds
of
a
new
day
of
strife
flying
toward
the
lines
in
the
first
light
of
dawn
when
the
sun
rose
its
rays
touched
their
wings
made
them
white
like
cabbage
butterflies
or
changed
them
to
silver
all
a
sparkle
i
saw
them
fly
over
the
german
positions
not
changing
their
course
then
all
about
them
burst
black
puffs
of
german
shrapnel
so
that
many
times
i
held
my
breath
because
they
seemed
in
the
center
of
the
burst
but
generally
when
the
cloud
cleared
they
were
flying
again
until
they
disappeared
in
the
mists
over
the
enemy
country
there
they
did
deadly
work
in
single
fights
with
german
airmen
or
against
great
odds
until
they
had
an
air
space
to
themselves
and
skimmed
the
earth
like
albatrosses
in
low
flight
attacking
nests
killing
or
scattering
the
gunners
by
a
burst
of
bullets
from
their
lewis
guns
dropping
bombs
on
german
wagon
transports
infantry
railway
trains
one
man
cut
a
train
in
half
and
saw
men
and
horses
falling
out
and
ammunition
dumps
directing
the
fire
of
our
guns
upon
living
targets
photographing
new
trenches
and
works
bombing
villages
crowded
with
german
troops
that
they
struck
terror
into
these
german
troops
was
proved
afterward
when
we
went
into
bapaume
and
peronne
and
many
villages
from
which
the
enemy
retreated
after
the
battles
of
the
somme
everywhere
there
were
signboards
on
which
was
written
flieger
schutz
aircraft
shelter
or
german
warnings
of
keep
to
the
sidewalks
this
road
is
constantly
bombed
by
british
they
were
a
new
plague
of
war
and
did
for
a
time
gain
a
complete
mastery
of
the
air
but
later
the
germans
learned
the
lesson
of
low
flying
and
night
bombing
and
in
and
came
back
in
greater
strength
and
made
the
nights
horrible
in
camps
behind
the
lines
and
in
villages
where
they
killed
many
soldiers
and
more
civilians
the
infantry
did
not
believe
much
in
our
air
supremacy
at
any
time
not
knowing
what
work
was
done
beyond
their
range
of
vision
and
seeing
our
machines
crashed
in
no
man
land
and
hearing
the
rattle
of
from
hostile
aircraft
above
their
own
trenches
those
aviators
of
ours
a
general
said
to
me
are
the
biggest
liars
in
the
world
cocky
fellows
claiming
impossible
achievements
what
proof
can
they
give
of
their
preposterous
tales
they
only
go
into
the
air
service
because
they
have
the
pluck
to
serve
in
the
that
was
prejudice
the
german
losses
were
proof
enough
of
our
fighting
skill
and
strength
and
german
prisoners
and
german
letters
confirmed
all
their
claims
but
we
were
dishonest
in
our
reckoning
from
first
to
last
and
the
british
public
was
hoodwinked
about
our
losses
three
of
our
machines
are
six
of
our
machines
are
yes
but
what
about
the
machines
which
crashed
in
no
man
land
and
behind
our
lines
they
were
not
missing
but
destroyed
and
the
boys
who
had
flown
in
them
were
dead
or
broken
to
the
end
of
the
war
those
aviators
of
ours
searched
the
air
for
their
adventures
fought
often
against
overwhelming
numbers
killed
the
german
champions
in
single
combat
or
in
tourneys
in
the
sky
and
let
down
tons
of
high
explosives
which
caused
great
death
and
widespread
destruction
and
in
this
work
they
died
like
flies
and
one
boy
life
one
of
those
laughing
fatalistic
intensely
living
boys
was
of
no
more
account
in
the
general
sum
of
slaughter
than
a
summer
midge
except
as
one
little
unit
in
the
armies
of
the
air
xiii
i
am
not
strong
enough
in
the
science
of
psychology
to
understand
the
origin
of
laughter
and
to
get
into
touch
with
the
mainsprings
of
gaiety
the
sharp
contrast
between
normal
ethics
and
an
abnormality
of
action
provides
a
grotesque
point
of
view
arousing
ironical
mirth
it
is
probable
also
that
surroundings
of
enormous
tragedy
stimulate
the
sense
of
humor
of
the
individual
so
that
any
small
ridiculous
thing
assumes
the
proportion
of
monstrous
absurdity
it
is
also
likely
certain
i
think
that
laughter
is
an
escape
from
terror
a
liberation
of
the
soul
by
mental
explosion
from
the
prison
walls
of
despair
and
brooding
in
the
decameron
of
boccaccio
a
group
of
men
and
women
encompassed
by
plague
retired
into
seclusion
to
tell
one
another
mirthful
immoralities
which
stirred
their
laughter
they
laughed
while
the
plague
destroyed
society
around
them
and
when
they
knew
that
its
foul
germs
were
on
the
prowl
for
their
own
bodies
so
it
was
in
this
war
where
in
many
strange
places
and
in
many
dreadful
days
there
was
great
laughter
i
think
sometimes
of
a
night
i
spent
with
the
medical
officers
of
a
tent
hospital
in
the
fields
of
the
somme
during
those
battles
with
me
as
a
guest
went
a
modern
falstaff
a
ton
of
flesh
who
sweats
to
death
and
lards
the
lean
earth
as
he
walks
he
was
a
man
of
many
anecdotes
drawn
from
the
sinks
and
stews
of
life
yet
with
a
sense
of
beauty
lurking
under
his
coarseness
and
a
voice
of
fine
sonorous
tone
which
he
managed
with
art
and
a
melting
grace
on
the
way
to
the
field
hospital
he
had
taken
more
than
one
nip
of
whisky
his
voice
was
well
oiled
when
he
sang
a
greeting
to
a
medical
major
in
a
florid
burst
of
melody
from
italian
opera
the
major
was
a
little
irish
medico
who
had
been
through
the
south
african
war
and
in
tropical
places
where
he
had
drunk
to
kill
all
manner
of
microbes
he
suffered
abominably
from
asthma
and
had
had
a
the
day
before
our
dinner
at
his
mess
and
told
us
that
he
would
drop
down
dead
as
sure
as
fate
between
one
operation
and
another
on
the
poor
bloody
wounded
who
never
ceased
to
flow
into
his
tent
but
he
was
in
a
laughing
mood
and
thirsty
for
liquid
he
had
two
whiskies
before
the
dinner
began
to
wet
his
whistle
his
were
out
for
an
evening
joy
but
nervous
of
the
colonel
an
austere
soul
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
mess
with
the
look
of
a
man
afraid
that
merriment
might
reach
outrageous
heights
beyond
his
control
a
courteous
man
he
was
and
rather
sad
his
presence
for
a
time
acted
as
a
restraint
upon
the
company
until
all
restraint
was
broken
by
the
falstaff
with
me
who
told
stories
to
the
little
irish
major
across
the
table
and
sang
love
lyrics
to
the
orderly
who
brought
round
the
cottage
pie
and
pickles
there
was
a
tall
thin
young
surgeon
who
had
been
carving
up
living
bodies
all
day
and
many
days
and
now
listened
to
that
fat
rogue
with
an
intensity
of
delight
that
lit
up
his
melancholy
eyes
watching
him
gravely
between
gusts
of
deep
laughter
which
seemed
to
come
from
his
boots
there
was
another
young
surgeon
once
of
barts
who
made
himself
the
of
the
fat
knight
and
kept
his
wine
at
the
brim
and
encouraged
him
to
fresh
audacities
of
anecdotry
with
a
humorous
glance
at
the
colonel
troubled
face
the
colonel
was
forgotten
after
dinner
the
little
irish
major
took
the
lid
off
the
boiling
pot
of
mirth
he
was
entirely
mad
as
he
assured
us
between
dances
of
a
wild
and
primitive
type
stories
of
adventure
in
far
lands
and
spasms
of
asthmatic
coughing
when
he
beat
his
breast
and
said
a
pox
in
my
bleeding
heart
falstaff
was
playing
juliet
to
the
romeo
of
the
tall
young
surgeon
singing
falsetto
like
a
fat
german
angel
dressed
in
khaki
with
his
belt
undone
there
were
charades
in
the
tent
the
boy
from
barts
did
remarkable
imitations
of
a
gamecock
challenging
a
rival
bird
of
a
cow
coming
through
a
gate
of
a
general
addressing
his
troops
most
comical
of
all
several
glasses
were
broken
the
corkscrew
was
disregarded
as
a
useless
implement
and
were
decapitated
against
the
tent
poles
i
remember
vaguely
the
crowning
episode
of
the
evening
when
the
little
major
was
dancing
the
irish
jig
with
a
kitchen
chair
when
falstaff
was
singing
the
prologue
of
pagliacci
to
the
stupefied
colonel
when
the
boy
once
of
barts
was
roaring
like
a
lion
under
the
mess
table
and
when
the
tall
melancholy
surgeon
was
at
the
top
of
the
tent
pole
scratching
himself
like
a
gorilla
in
his
native
haunts
outside
the
field
hospital
was
quiet
under
a
fleecy
sky
with
a
crescent
moon
through
the
painted
canvas
of
the
tent
city
glowed
with
a
faint
light
and
the
red
cross
hung
limp
above
the
camp
where
many
wounded
lay
waking
or
sleeping
tossing
in
agony
dying
in
unconsciousness
far
away
over
the
fields
rockets
were
rising
above
the
the
sky
was
flickering
with
the
flush
of
a
red
glare
rose
and
spread
below
the
clouds
where
some
had
been
exploded
old
falstaff
fell
asleep
in
the
car
on
the
way
back
to
our
quarters
and
i
smiled
at
the
memory
of
great
laughter
in
the
midst
of
tragedy
xiv
the
struggle
of
men
from
one
low
ridge
to
another
low
ridge
in
a
territory
forty
miles
wide
by
more
than
twenty
miles
deep
during
five
months
of
fighting
was
enormous
in
its
intensity
and
prolongation
of
slaughter
wounding
and
endurance
of
all
hardships
and
terrors
of
war
as
an
i
saw
the
full
scope
of
the
bloody
drama
i
saw
day
by
day
the
tidal
waves
of
wounded
limping
back
until
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
had
passed
through
our
casualty
clearing
stations
and
then
were
not
finished
i
went
among
these
men
when
the
blood
was
wet
on
them
and
talked
with
hundreds
of
them
and
heard
their
individual
narratives
of
escapes
from
death
until
my
imagination
was
saturated
with
the
spirit
of
their
conflict
of
body
and
soul
i
saw
a
green
downy
countryside
beautiful
in
its
summer
life
ravaged
by
so
that
the
white
chalk
of
its
subsoil
was
flung
above
the
earth
and
grass
in
a
wide
sterile
stretch
of
desolation
pitted
with
ditched
by
deep
trenches
whose
walls
were
hideously
upheaved
by
explosive
fire
and
littered
yard
after
yard
mile
after
mile
with
broken
wire
rifles
bombs
unexploded
shells
rags
of
uniform
dead
bodies
or
bits
of
bodies
and
all
the
filth
of
battle
i
saw
many
villages
flung
into
ruin
or
blown
clean
off
the
map
i
walked
into
such
villages
as
contalmaison
martinpuich
le
sars
thilloy
and
at
last
bapaume
when
a
smell
of
burning
and
the
fumes
of
explosives
and
the
stench
of
dead
flesh
rose
up
to
one
nostrils
and
one
very
soul
when
our
dead
and
german
dead
lay
about
and
newly
wounded
came
walking
through
the
ruins
or
were
carried
shoulder
high
on
stretchers
and
consciously
and
subconsciously
the
living
unwounded
men
who
went
through
these
places
knew
that
death
lurked
about
them
and
around
them
and
above
them
and
at
any
second
might
make
its
pounce
upon
their
own
flesh
i
saw
our
men
going
into
battle
with
strong
battalions
and
coming
out
of
it
with
weak
battalions
i
saw
them
in
the
midst
of
battle
at
thiepval
at
contalmaison
at
guillemont
by
loupart
wood
when
they
trudged
toward
lines
of
german
trenches
bunching
a
little
in
groups
dodging
falling
in
single
figures
or
in
batches
and
fighting
over
the
enemy
parapets
i
sat
with
them
in
their
dugouts
before
battle
and
after
battle
saw
their
bodies
gathered
up
for
burial
heard
their
snuffle
of
death
in
hospital
sat
by
their
bedside
when
they
were
sorely
wounded
so
the
full
tragic
drama
of
that
long
conflict
on
the
somme
was
burned
into
my
brain
and
i
was
as
it
were
a
part
of
it
and
i
am
still
seared
with
its
remembrance
and
shall
always
be
but
however
deep
the
knowledge
of
tragedy
a
man
would
be
a
liar
if
he
refused
to
admit
the
heroism
the
gallantry
of
youth
even
the
gaiety
of
men
in
these
infernal
months
psychology
on
the
somme
was
not
simple
and
straightforward
men
were
afraid
but
fear
was
not
their
dominating
emotion
except
in
the
worst
hours
men
hated
this
fighting
but
found
excitement
in
it
often
exultation
sometimes
an
intense
stimulus
of
all
their
senses
and
passions
before
reaction
and
exhaustion
men
became
jibbering
idiots
with
as
i
saw
some
of
them
but
others
rejoiced
when
they
saw
our
shells
plowing
into
the
enemy
earthworks
laughed
at
their
own
narrow
escapes
and
at
grotesque
comicalities
of
this
monstrous
deviltry
the
officers
were
proud
of
their
men
eager
for
their
honor
and
achievement
the
men
themselves
were
in
rivalry
with
other
bodies
of
troops
and
proud
of
their
own
prowess
they
were
scornful
of
all
that
the
enemy
might
do
to
them
yet
acknowledged
his
courage
and
power
they
were
quick
to
kill
him
yet
quick
also
to
give
him
a
chance
of
life
by
surrender
and
after
that
were
nine
times
out
of
ten
chivalrous
and
kindly
but
incredibly
brutal
on
the
rare
occasions
when
passion
overcame
them
at
some
tale
of
treachery
they
had
the
pride
of
the
skilled
laborer
in
his
own
craft
as
bombers
raiders
men
and
were
keen
to
show
their
skill
whatever
the
risks
they
were
healthy
animals
with
animal
courage
as
well
as
animal
fear
and
they
had
some
of
them
a
spiritual
and
moral
fervor
which
bade
them
risk
death
to
save
a
comrade
or
to
save
a
position
or
to
kill
the
fear
that
tried
to
fetter
them
or
to
lead
men
with
greater
fear
than
theirs
they
lived
from
hour
to
hour
and
forgot
the
peril
or
the
misery
that
had
passed
and
did
not
forestall
the
future
by
apprehension
unless
they
were
of
sensitive
mind
with
the
worst
quality
men
might
have
in
modern
warfare
imagination
they
trained
themselves
to
an
intense
egotism
within
narrow
boundaries
fifty
yards
to
the
left
or
five
hundred
men
were
being
pounded
to
death
by
fifty
yards
to
the
right
or
five
hundred
men
were
being
mowed
down
by
fire
for
the
time
being
their
particular
patch
was
quiet
it
was
their
luck
why
worry
about
the
other
fellow
the
length
of
a
traverse
in
a
ditch
called
a
trench
might
make
all
the
difference
between
heaven
and
hell
dead
bodies
were
being
piled
up
on
one
side
of
the
traverse
a
shell
had
smashed
into
the
platoon
next
door
there
was
a
nasty
mess
men
sat
under
their
own
and
scooped
out
a
tin
of
bully
beef
and
hoped
nothing
would
scoop
them
out
of
their
bit
of
earth
this
protective
egotism
seemed
to
me
the
instinctive
of
men
in
dangerous
places
when
i
saw
them
in
the
line
in
a
little
way
not
as
a
soldier
but
as
a
correspondent
taking
only
a
thousandth
part
of
the
risks
of
i
found
myself
using
this
they
were
strafing
on
the
left
shells
were
pitching
on
the
right
very
nasty
for
the
men
in
either
of
those
places
poor
devils
but
meanwhile
i
was
on
a
safe
patch
it
seemed
thank
heaven
for
that
here
said
an
elderly
officer
one
of
those
rare
exalted
souls
who
thought
that
death
was
a
little
thing
to
give
for
one
sake
here
we
may
be
killed
at
any
moment
he
spoke
the
words
in
contalmaison
with
a
glow
in
his
voice
as
though
announcing
glad
tidings
to
a
friend
who
was
a
war
artist
camouflaged
as
a
lieutenant
and
new
to
the
scene
of
battle
but
said
the
adjusting
his
steel
hat
nervously
i
do
want
to
be
killed
i
hate
the
idea
of
it
he
was
the
normal
man
the
elderly
officer
was
abnormal
the
normal
man
soldier
without
camouflage
had
no
use
for
death
at
all
unless
it
was
in
connection
with
the
fellow
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
he
hated
the
notion
of
it
applied
to
himself
he
fought
ferociously
desperately
heroically
to
escape
it
yet
there
were
times
many
times
when
he
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
the
near
neighborhood
of
that
grisly
specter
because
in
immediate
temporary
tranquillity
he
thrust
the
thought
from
his
mind
and
smoked
a
cigarette
and
exchanged
a
joke
with
the
fellow
at
his
elbow
there
were
other
times
when
in
a
state
of
mental
exaltation
or
spiritual
or
physical
excitement
he
acted
regardless
of
all
risks
and
did
mad
marvelous
almost
miraculous
things
hardly
conscious
of
his
own
acts
but
impelled
to
do
as
he
did
by
the
passion
within
him
passion
of
love
passion
of
hate
passion
of
fear
or
passion
of
pride
those
men
moved
like
that
were
the
leaders
the
heroes
and
groups
followed
them
sometimes
because
of
their
intensity
of
purpose
and
the
infection
of
their
emotion
and
the
comfort
that
came
from
their
real
or
apparent
in
frightful
situations
those
who
got
through
were
astonished
at
their
own
courage
many
of
them
became
convinced
consciously
or
subconsciously
that
they
were
immune
from
shells
and
bullets
they
walked
through
harassing
fire
with
a
queer
sense
of
carelessness
they
had
escaped
so
often
that
some
of
them
had
a
kind
of
disdain
of
until
perhaps
one
day
something
snapped
in
their
nervous
system
as
often
it
did
and
the
bang
of
a
door
in
a
billet
behind
the
lines
or
a
wreath
of
smoke
from
some
domestic
chimney
gave
them
a
sudden
shock
of
fear
men
differed
wonderfully
in
their
and
it
was
no
question
of
difference
in
courage
in
the
mass
all
our
soldiers
seemed
equally
brave
in
the
mass
they
seemed
astoundingly
cheerful
in
spite
of
all
the
abomination
of
that
somme
fighting
our
troops
before
battle
and
after
battle
a
few
days
after
looked
free
from
haunting
anxieties
and
were
easy
in
their
way
of
laughter
it
was
optimism
in
the
mass
heroism
in
the
mass
it
was
only
when
one
spoke
to
the
individual
some
friend
who
bared
his
soul
a
second
or
some
in
the
multitude
with
whom
one
talked
with
truth
that
one
saw
the
hatred
of
a
man
for
his
job
the
sense
of
doom
upon
him
the
weakness
that
was
in
his
strength
the
bitterness
of
his
grudge
against
a
fate
that
forced
him
to
go
on
in
this
way
of
life
the
remembrance
of
a
life
more
beautiful
which
he
had
abandoned
all
mingled
with
those
other
qualities
of
pride
and
comradeship
and
that
illogical
sense
of
humor
which
made
up
the
strange
complexity
of
his
psychology
xv
it
was
a
colonel
of
the
north
staffordshires
who
revealed
to
me
the
astounding
belief
that
he
was
immune
from
and
i
met
other
men
afterward
with
the
same
conviction
he
had
just
come
out
of
desperate
fighting
in
the
neighborhood
of
thiepval
where
his
battalion
had
suffered
heavily
and
at
first
he
was
rude
and
sullen
in
the
hut
i
gaged
him
as
a
hard
northerner
without
a
shred
of
sentiment
or
the
flicker
of
any
imaginative
light
a
stern
ruthless
man
he
was
bitter
in
his
speech
to
me
because
the
north
staffords
were
never
mentioned
in
my
despatches
he
believed
that
this
was
due
to
some
personal
spite
not
knowing
the
injustice
of
our
military
censorship
under
the
orders
of
why
the
hell
do
we
get
a
word
he
asked
have
we
done
as
well
as
anybody
died
as
much
i
promised
to
do
what
i
could
which
was
nothing
to
put
the
matter
right
and
presently
he
softened
and
later
was
amazingly
candid
in
i
have
a
mystical
power
he
said
nothing
will
ever
hit
me
as
long
as
i
keep
that
power
which
comes
from
faith
it
is
a
question
of
absolute
belief
in
the
domination
of
mind
over
matter
i
go
through
any
barrage
unscathed
because
my
will
is
strong
enough
to
turn
aside
explosive
shells
and
bullets
as
matter
they
must
obey
my
intelligence
they
are
powerless
to
resist
the
mind
of
a
man
in
touch
with
the
universal
spirit
as
i
he
spoke
quietly
and
soberly
in
a
way
i
decided
that
he
was
mad
that
was
not
surprising
we
were
all
mad
in
one
way
or
another
or
at
one
time
or
another
it
was
the
unusual
form
of
madness
that
astonished
me
i
envied
him
his
particular
i
wished
i
could
cultivate
it
as
an
aid
to
courage
he
claimed
another
peculiar
form
of
knowledge
he
knew
before
each
action
he
told
me
what
officers
and
men
of
his
would
be
killed
in
battle
he
looked
at
a
man
eyes
and
knew
and
he
claimed
that
he
never
made
a
mistake
he
was
sorry
to
possess
that
second
sight
and
it
worried
him
there
were
many
men
who
had
a
conviction
that
they
would
not
be
killed
although
they
did
not
state
it
in
the
terms
expressed
by
the
colonel
of
the
north
staffordshires
and
it
is
curious
that
in
some
cases
i
know
they
were
not
mistaken
and
are
still
alive
it
was
indeed
a
general
belief
that
if
a
man
funked
being
hit
he
was
sure
to
fall
that
being
the
reverse
side
of
the
argument
i
saw
the
serene
cheerfulness
of
men
in
the
places
of
death
at
many
times
and
in
many
places
and
i
remember
one
group
of
friends
on
the
somme
who
revealed
that
quality
to
a
high
degree
it
was
when
our
ran
just
outside
the
village
of
martinpuich
to
courcelette
on
the
other
side
of
the
bapaume
road
and
when
the
gordons
were
there
after
their
fight
through
longueval
and
over
the
ridge
it
was
the
little
crowd
i
have
mentioned
before
in
the
battle
of
loos
and
it
was
lieut
john
wood
who
took
me
to
the
battalion
headquarters
located
under
some
in
a
german
dug
out
all
the
way
up
to
contalmaison
and
beyond
there
were
the
signs
of
recent
bloodshed
and
of
present
peril
dead
horses
lay
about
disemboweled
by
legs
and
arms
protruded
from
where
bodies
lay
half
buried
heavy
crumps
came
howling
through
the
sky
and
bursting
with
enormous
noise
here
there
and
everywhere
over
that
vast
desolate
battlefield
with
its
clumps
of
ruin
and
rows
of
dead
trees
it
was
the
and
i
hated
every
yard
of
it
but
john
wood
who
lived
in
it
was
astoundingly
cheerful
and
a
fine
sturdy
gallant
figure
in
his
kilted
dress
as
he
climbed
over
walked
on
the
top
of
communication
trenches
not
bothering
to
take
cover
and
skirting
round
hedges
of
barbed
wire
apparently
unconscious
of
the
crumps
that
were
bursting
around
i
found
laughter
and
friendly
greeting
in
a
hole
in
the
earth
where
the
battalion
staff
was
crowded
the
colonel
was
courteous
but
busy
he
rather
deprecated
the
notion
that
i
should
go
up
farther
to
the
ultimate
limit
of
our
line
it
was
no
use
putting
one
head
into
trouble
without
reasonable
purpose
and
the
german
guns
had
been
blowing
in
sections
of
his
trenches
but
john
wood
was
insistent
that
i
should
meet
old
thom
afterward
in
command
of
the
battalion
he
had
just
been
buried
and
dug
out
again
he
would
like
to
see
me
so
we
left
the
cover
of
the
dugout
and
took
to
the
open
again
long
lines
of
jocks
were
digging
a
support
trench
digging
with
a
kind
of
rhythmic
movement
as
they
threw
up
the
earth
with
their
shovels
behind
them
was
another
line
of
jocks
not
working
they
lay
as
though
asleep
out
in
the
open
they
were
the
dead
of
the
last
advance
captain
thom
was
leaning
up
against
the
wall
of
the
trench
smoking
a
cigarette
with
his
steel
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
a
handsome
laughing
figure
he
did
not
look
like
a
man
who
had
just
been
buried
and
dug
out
again
it
was
a
narrow
shave
he
said
a
beastly
shell
covered
me
with
a
ton
of
earth
have
a
cigarette
wo
you
we
gossiped
as
though
in
james
street
other
young
scottish
officers
came
up
and
shook
hands
and
said
jolly
weather
is
it
what
do
you
think
of
our
little
show
not
one
of
them
gave
a
glance
at
the
line
of
dead
men
over
there
behind
their
parados
they
told
me
some
of
the
funny
things
that
had
happened
lately
in
the
battalion
some
grim
jokes
by
tough
jocks
they
had
a
fine
crowd
of
men
you
could
beat
them
well
good
morning
must
get
on
with
the
there
was
no
anguish
there
no
sense
of
despair
no
sullen
hatred
of
this
life
so
near
to
death
they
seemed
to
like
it
they
did
not
really
like
it
they
only
made
the
best
of
it
without
gloom
i
saw
they
did
not
like
this
job
of
battle
one
evening
in
their
mess
behind
the
line
the
colonel
who
commanded
them
at
the
time
celt
of
the
celts
was
in
a
queer
mood
he
was
a
queer
man
aloof
in
his
manner
a
little
he
was
annoyed
with
three
of
his
officers
who
had
come
back
late
from
three
days
paris
leave
they
were
giants
but
stood
like
schoolboys
before
their
master
while
he
spoke
ironical
bitter
words
later
in
the
evening
he
mentioned
casually
that
they
must
prepare
to
go
into
the
line
again
under
special
orders
what
about
the
store
of
bombs
ammunition
the
officers
were
stricken
into
silence
they
stared
at
one
another
as
though
to
say
what
does
the
old
man
mean
is
this
true
one
of
them
became
rather
pale
and
there
was
a
look
of
tragic
resignation
in
his
eyes
another
said
hell
in
a
whisper
the
adjutant
answered
the
colonel
questions
in
a
formal
way
but
thinking
hard
and
studying
the
colonel
face
anxiously
do
you
mean
to
say
we
are
going
into
the
line
again
sir
at
once
the
colonel
laughed
do
look
so
scared
all
of
you
it
only
a
for
the
officers
of
the
gordons
breathed
more
freely
poof
they
had
been
fairly
taken
in
by
the
old
man
no
it
was
clear
they
did
not
find
any
real
joy
in
the
line
they
would
not
choose
a
trench
as
the
most
desirable
place
of
residence
xvi
in
queer
psychology
there
was
a
strange
mingling
of
the
pitiful
and
comic
among
a
division
the
known
as
the
bantams
they
were
all
volunteers
having
been
rejected
by
the
ordinary
on
account
of
their
diminutive
stature
which
was
on
an
average
five
feet
high
descending
to
four
feet
six
most
of
them
came
from
lancashire
cheshire
durham
and
glasgow
being
the
dwarfed
children
of
industrial
england
and
its
cruelties
others
were
from
london
banded
together
in
a
battalion
of
the
middlesex
regiment
they
gave
a
shock
to
our
french
friends
when
they
arrived
as
a
division
at
the
port
of
boulogne
name
of
a
dog
said
the
quayside
loungers
england
is
truly
in
a
bad
way
she
is
sending
out
her
last
reserves
but
they
are
the
soldiers
of
lilliput
exclaimed
others
it
is
terrible
that
they
should
send
these
little
ones
said
fishwives
under
the
training
of
general
pi
who
commanded
them
they
became
smart
and
brisk
in
the
ranks
they
saluted
like
miniature
guardsmen
marched
with
quick
little
steps
like
clockwork
soldiers
it
was
comical
to
see
them
strutting
up
and
down
as
sentries
outside
divisional
headquarters
with
their
bayonets
high
above
their
wee
bodies
in
trench
warfare
they
did
well
though
the
had
to
be
raised
to
let
them
see
over
the
top
and
in
one
raid
captured
a
german
which
i
saw
in
their
hands
and
hauled
it
back
a
heavier
weight
than
ours
like
ants
struggling
with
a
stick
of
straw
in
actual
battle
they
were
hardly
strong
enough
and
could
not
carry
all
that
burden
of
steel
helmet
rifle
shovels
empty
with
which
other
troops
went
into
action
so
they
were
used
as
support
troops
mostly
behind
the
black
watch
and
other
battalions
near
bazentin
and
longueval
and
there
these
poor
little
men
dug
and
dug
like
beavers
and
crouched
in
the
cover
they
made
under
damnable
fire
until
many
of
them
were
blown
to
bits
there
was
no
glory
in
their
job
only
filth
and
blood
but
they
held
the
ground
and
suffered
it
all
not
gladly
they
had
a
chance
of
taking
prisoners
at
longueval
where
they
rummaged
in
german
dugouts
after
the
line
had
been
taken
by
the
scottish
division
and
the
and
they
brought
back
a
number
of
enormous
bavarians
who
were
like
the
brobdingnagians
to
these
little
men
of
lilliput
and
disgusted
with
that
humiliation
i
met
the
whole
crowd
of
them
after
that
adventure
as
they
sat
half
naked
picking
the
lice
out
of
their
shirts
and
the
conversation
i
had
with
them
remains
in
my
memory
because
of
its
grotesque
humor
and
tragic
comicality
they
were
excited
and
emotional
these
stunted
men
they
cursed
the
war
with
the
foulest
curses
of
scottish
and
northern
dialects
there
was
one
fellow
the
jester
of
them
all
whose
language
would
have
made
the
poppies
blush
with
ironical
laughter
outrageous
blasphemy
grotesque
imagery
he
described
the
suffering
of
himself
and
his
mates
under
barrage
fire
which
smashed
many
of
them
into
bleeding
pulp
he
had
no
use
for
this
war
he
cursed
the
name
of
he
advocated
a
trade
unionism
among
soldiers
to
down
tools
whenever
there
was
a
threat
of
war
he
was
a
bolshevist
before
bolshevism
yet
he
had
no
liking
for
germans
and
desired
to
cut
them
into
small
bits
to
slit
their
throats
to
disembowel
them
he
looked
homeward
to
a
yorkshire
town
and
wondered
what
his
missus
would
say
if
she
saw
him
scratching
himself
like
an
ape
or
lying
with
his
head
in
the
earth
with
shells
bursting
around
him
or
prodding
germans
with
a
bayonet
oh
said
that
hero
there
will
be
a
lot
of
murder
after
this
bloody
war
what
human
life
what
the
value
of
one
man
throat
we
trained
up
as
murderers
i
do
dislike
it
mind
you
and
after
the
war
we
get
out
of
the
habit
of
it
it
come
like
he
was
talking
for
my
benefit
egged
on
to
further
audacities
by
a
group
of
comrades
who
roared
with
laughter
and
said
go
it
bill
that
the
stuff
among
these
lilliputians
were
fellows
who
sat
aloof
and
sullen
or
spoke
of
their
adventure
with
its
recent
horror
in
their
eyes
some
of
them
had
big
heads
on
small
bodies
as
though
they
suffered
from
water
on
the
brain
many
of
them
were
sent
home
afterward
general
haldane
as
commander
of
the
corps
paraded
them
and
poked
his
stick
at
the
more
wizened
ones
the
obviously
unfit
the
degenerates
and
said
at
each
prod
you
can
go
you
the
bantam
division
ceased
to
exist
they
afforded
many
jokes
to
the
army
one
anecdote
went
the
round
a
bantam
died
of
disease
and
he

said
general
haldane

the

time

trois

poor
little
men
born
of
diseased
civilization
they
were
volunteers
to
a
man
and
some
of
them
with
as
much
courage
as
soldiers
twice
their
size
they
were
the
bantams
who
told
me
of
the
anglican
padre
at
longueval
it
was
father
hall
of
mirfield
attached
to
the
south
african
brigade
he
came
out
to
a
dressing
station
established
in
the
one
bit
of
ruin
which
could
be
used
for
shelter
and
devoted
himself
to
the
wounded
with
a
spiritual
fervor
they
were
suffering
horribly
from
thirst
which
made
their
tongues
swell
and
set
their
throats
on
fire
water
they
cried
water
for
christ
sake
water
there
was
no
water
except
at
a
well
in
longueval
under
the
fire
of
german
snipers
who
picked
off
our
men
when
they
crawled
down
like
wild
dogs
with
their
tongues
lolling
out
there
was
one
german
officer
there
in
a
not
far
from
the
well
who
sat
with
his
revolver
handy
and
he
was
a
dead
shot
but
he
did
not
shoot
the
padre
something
in
the
face
and
figure
of
that
chaplain
his
disregard
of
the
bullets
snapping
about
him
the
upright
fearless
way
in
which
he
crossed
that
way
of
death
held
back
the
of
the
german
officer
and
he
let
him
pass
he
passed
many
times
untouched
by
bullets
or
fire
and
he
went
into
bad
places
pits
of
horror
carrying
hot
tea
which
he
made
from
the
well
water
for
men
in
agony
xvii
during
these
battles
i
saw
thousands
of
german
prisoners
and
studied
their
types
and
physiognomy
and
by
permission
of
intelligence
officers
spoke
with
many
of
them
in
their
cages
or
on
the
field
of
battle
when
they
came
along
under
escort
some
of
them
looked
degraded
bestial
men
one
could
imagine
them
guilty
of
the
foulest
atrocities
but
in
the
mass
they
seemed
to
me
decent
simple
men
remarkably
like
our
own
lads
from
the
saxon
counties
of
england
though
not
quite
so
bright
and
brisk
as
was
only
natural
in
their
position
as
prisoners
with
all
the
misery
of
war
in
their
souls
afterward
they
worked
with
patient
industry
in
the
and
established
their
own
discipline
and
gave
very
little
trouble
if
well
handled
in
each
crowd
of
them
there
were
fellows
who
spoke
perfect
english
having
lived
in
england
as
waiters
and
hairdressers
or
clerks
or
mechanics
it
was
with
them
i
spoke
most
because
it
was
easiest
but
i
know
enough
german
to
talk
with
the
others
and
i
found
among
them
all
the
same
loathing
of
war
the
same
bewilderment
as
to
its
causes
the
same
sense
of
being
driven
by
evil
powers
above
them
the
officers
were
different
they
lost
a
good
deal
of
their
arrogance
but
to
the
last
had
excuses
ready
for
all
that
germany
had
done
and
almost
to
the
last
professed
to
believe
that
germany
would
win
their
sense
of
caste
was
in
their
nature
they
refused
to
travel
in
the
same
carriages
with
their
men
to
stay
even
for
an
hour
in
the
same
inclosures
with
them
they
regarded
them
for
the
most
part
as
inferior
beings
and
there
were
castes
even
among
the
officers
i
remember
that
in
the
last
phase
when
we
captured
a
number
of
cavalry
officers
these
elegant
fellows
held
aloof
from
the
infantry
officers
and
would
not
mix
with
them
one
of
them
paced
up
and
down
all
night
alone
and
all
next
day
stiff
in
the
corsets
below
that
uniform
not
speaking
to
a
soul
though
within
a
few
yards
of
him
were
many
officers
of
infantry
regiments
our
men
treated
their
prisoners
nearly
always
after
the
blood
of
battle
was
out
of
their
eyes
with
a
good
natured
kindness
that
astonished
the
germans
themselves
i
have
seen
them
filling
german
at
considerable
trouble
and
the
escorts
two
or
three
to
a
big
batch
of
men
were
utterly
trustful
of
them
here
hold
my
rifle
fritz
said
one
of
our
men
getting
down
from
a
to
greet
a
friend
an
officer
standing
by
took
notice
of
this
take
your
rifle
back
at
once
is
that
the
way
to
guard
your
prisoners
our
man
was
astonished
lor
bless
you
sir
they
do
want
no
guarding
they
glad
to
be
took
they
guard
your
men
are
extraordinary
a
german
officer
told
me
they
asked
me
whether
i
would
care
to
go
down
at
once
or
wait
till
the
barrage
had
he
seemed
amazed
at
that
thoughtfulness
for
his
comfort
it
was
in
the
early
days
of
the
somme
fighting
and
crowds
of
our
men
stood
on
the
banks
above
a
sunken
road
watching
the
prisoners
coming
down
this
officer
who
spoke
to
me
had
an
iron
cross
and
the
men
wanted
to
see
it
and
handle
it
will
they
give
it
back
again
he
asked
nervously
fumbling
at
the
ribbon
certainly
i
assured
him
he
handed
it
to
me
and
i
gave
it
to
the
men
who
passed
it
from
one
to
the
other
and
then
back
to
the
owner
your
men
are
extraordinary
he
said
they
are
one
of
the
most
interesting
prisoners
i
met
on
the
field
of
battle
was
a
tall
man
whom
i
saw
walking
away
from
la
boisselle
when
that
place
was
smoking
with
an
english
soldier
was
on
each
side
of
him
and
each
man
carried
a
while
this
giant
chatted
with
them
it
was
a
strange
group
and
i
edged
nearer
to
them
and
spoke
to
one
of
the
men
who
this
why
do
you
carry
his
bags
oh
we
giving
him
special
privileges
said
the
man
he
stayed
behind
to
look
after
our
wounded
said
his
job
was
to
look
after
wounded
whoever
they
were
so
there
he
been
in
a
dugout
bandaging
our
lads
and
no
joke
either
it
hell
up
there
we
glad
to
get
out
of
i
spoke
to
the
german
doctor
and
walked
with
him
he
discussed
the
philosophy
of
the
war
simply
and
with
what
seemed
like
sincerity
this
war
he
said
with
a
sad
ironical
laugh
we
go
on
killing
one
no
purpose
europe
is
being
bled
to
death
and
will
be
impoverished
for
long
years
we
germans
thought
it
was
a
war
for
kultur
our
civilization
now
we
know
it
is
a
war
against
kultur
against
religion
against
all
how
will
it
end
i
asked
him
i
see
no
end
to
it
he
answered
it
is
the
suicide
of
nations
germany
is
strong
and
england
is
strong
and
france
is
strong
it
is
impossible
for
one
side
to
crush
the
other
so
when
is
the
end
to
come
i
met
many
other
prisoners
then
and
a
year
afterward
who
could
see
no
end
of
the
massacre
they
believed
the
war
would
go
on
until
living
humanity
on
all
sides
revolted
from
the
unceasing
sacrifice
in
the
autumn
of
when
at
last
the
end
came
in
sight
by
german
defeat
unexpected
a
few
months
before
even
by
the
greatest
optimist
in
the
british
armies
the
german
soldiers
were
glad
they
did
not
care
how
the
war
ended
so
long
as
it
ended
defeat
what
did
that
matter
was
it
worse
to
be
defeated
than
for
the
race
to
perish
by
bleeding
to
death
xviii
the
struggle
for
the
pozieres
ridge
and
high
wood
lasted
from
the
beginning
of
august
until
the
middle
of
september
six
weeks
of
fighting
as
desperate
as
any
in
the
history
of
the
world
until
that
time
the
australians
dealt
with
pozieres
itself
working
round
moquet
farm
where
the
germans
refused
to
be
routed
from
their
tunnels
and
up
to
the
windmill
on
the
high
ground
of
pozieres
for
which
there
was
unceasing
slaughter
on
both
sides
because
the
germans
again
and
again
and
waves
of
men
surged
up
and
fell
around
that
mound
of
forsaken
brick
which
i
saw
as
a
reddish
cone
through
flame
and
smoke
those
australians
whom
i
had
seen
arrive
in
france
had
proved
their
quality
they
had
come
believing
that
nothing
could
be
worse
than
their
ordeal
in
the
dardanelles
now
they
knew
that
pozieres
was
the
last
word
in
frightfulness
the
intensity
of
the
under
which
they
lay
shook
them
if
it
did
not
kill
them
many
of
their
wounded
told
me
that
it
had
broken
their
nerve
they
would
never
fight
again
without
a
sense
of
horror
our
men
are
more
highly
strung
than
the
english
said
one
australian
officer
and
i
was
astonished
to
hear
these
words
because
those
australians
seemed
to
me
without
nerves
and
as
tough
as
gristle
in
their
fiber
they
fought
stubbornly
grimly
in
ground
so
ravaged
with
fire
that
the
earth
was
finely
powdered
they
stormed
the
pozieres
ridge
yard
by
yard
and
held
its
crest
under
sweeping
barrages
which
tore
up
their
trenches
as
soon
as
they
were
dug
and
buried
and
mangled
their
living
flesh
in
six
weeks
they
suffered
twenty
thousand
casualties
and
pozieres
now
is
an
australian
graveyard
and
the
memorial
that
stands
there
is
to
the
ghosts
of
that
splendid
youth
which
fell
in
heaps
about
that
plateau
and
the
slopes
below
many
english
boys
of
the
sussex
west
kents
surrey
and
warwick
regiments
in
the
division
died
at
their
side
not
less
patient
in
sacrifice
not
liking
it
better
many
scots
of
the
and
divisions
many
many
london
men
of
the
and
divisions
fell
killed
or
wounded
to
the
right
of
them
on
the
way
to
martinpuich
and
eaucourt
and
flers
from
high
wood
and
longueval
and
bazentin
the
division
of
yorkshires
and
northumberland
fusiliers
royal
scots
and
gordons
were
earning
that
name
of
the
iron
division
and
not
by
any
easy
heroism
every
division
in
the
british
army
took
its
turn
in
the
of
the
somme
and
was
duly
blooded
at
a
cost
of
per
cent
and
sometimes
per
cent
of
their
fighting
strength
the
canadians
took
up
the
struggle
at
courcelette
and
captured
it
in
a
fierce
and
bloody
battle
the
australians
worked
up
on
the
right
of
the
road
to
thilloy
and
ligny
thilloy
on
the
far
left
the
fortress
of
thiepval
had
fallen
at
last
after
repeated
and
frightful
assaults
which
i
watched
from
ditches
close
enough
to
see
our
infantry
wiltshires
and
worcesters
of
the
division
trudging
through
infernal
fire
and
then
at
last
after
five
months
of
superhuman
effort
enormous
sacrifice
desperate
and
the
tenacity
of
each
individual
human
ant
in
this
wild
the
german
lines
were
smashed
the
australians
surged
into
bapaume
and
the
enemy
stricken
by
the
prolonged
fury
of
our
attack
fell
back
in
a
far
and
wide
retreat
across
a
country
which
he
laid
waste
to
the
shelter
of
his
hindenburg
line
from
bullecourt
to
xix
the
goal
of
our
desire
seemed
attained
when
at
last
we
reached
bapaume
after
these
terrific
battles
in
which
all
our
divisions
numbering
nearly
a
million
men
took
part
with
not
much
difference
in
courage
not
much
difference
in
average
of
loss
by
the
end
of
that
fighting
our
casualties
had
mounted
up
to
the
frightful
total
of
four
hundred
thousand
men
those
fields
were
strewn
with
our
dead
our
graveyards
were
growing
forests
of
little
white
crosses
the
german
dead
lay
in
heaps
there
were
twelve
hundred
corpses
littered
over
the
earth
below
loupart
wood
in
one
mass
and
eight
hundred
of
them
were
german
i
could
not
walk
without
treading
on
them
there
when
i
fell
in
the
slime
i
clutched
arms
and
legs
the
stench
of
death
was
strong
and
awful
but
our
men
who
had
escaped
death
and
kept
their
sanity
through
all
this
wilderness
of
slaughter
kept
oh
marvelous
their
spirit
of
humor
their
faith
in
some
kind
of
victory
i
was
with
the
australians
on
that
day
when
they
swarmed
into
bapaume
and
they
brought
out
trophies
like
men
at
a
country
fair
i
remember
an
australian
colonel
who
came
riding
with
a
german
at
his
saddle
next
day
though
shells
were
still
bursting
in
the
ruins
some
australian
boys
set
up
some
painted
scenery
which
they
had
found
among
the
rubbish
and
chalked
up
the
name
of
the
the
enemy
was
in
retreat
to
his
hindenburg
line
over
a
wide
stretch
of
country
which
he
laid
waste
behind
him
making
a
desert
of
french
villages
and
orchards
and
parks
so
that
even
the
were
cut
down
and
the
churches
blown
up
and
the
graves
ransacked
for
their
lead
it
was
the
enemy
first
retreat
on
the
western
front
and
that
ferocious
fighting
of
the
british
troops
had
smashed
the
strongest
defenses
ever
built
in
war
and
our
raw
recruits
had
broken
the
most
famous
regiments
of
the
german
army
so
in
spite
of
all
tragedy
and
all
agony
our
men
were
not
downcast
but
followed
up
their
enemy
with
a
sense
of
excitement
because
it
seemed
so
much
like
victory
and
the
end
of
war
when
the
germans
retreated
from
gommecourt
where
so
many
boys
of
the
london
division
had
fallen
on
the
of
july
i
went
through
that
evil
place
by
way
of
fonquevillers
which
we
called
funky
villas
and
stumbling
over
the
and
broken
trenches
and
dead
bodies
between
the
dead
masts
of
slashed
and
branchless
trees
came
into
the
open
country
to
our
outpost
line
i
met
there
a
friendly
sergeant
who
surprised
me
by
referring
in
a
casual
way
to
a
little
old
book
of
mine
this
place
he
said
glancing
at
me
is
a
strange
street
of
it
reminded
me
of
another
reference
to
that
tale
of
mine
when
i
was
among
a
crowd
of
london
lads
who
had
just
been
engaged
in
a
bloody
fight
at
a
place
called
the
hairpin
a
young
officer
sent
for
me
and
i
found
him
in
the
loft
of
a
stinking
barn
sitting
in
a
tub
as
naked
as
he
was
born
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
he
said
whether
katharine
married
frank
the
sergeant
at
gommecourt
was
anxious
to
show
me
his
own
street
of
adventure
i
belong
to
he
said
meaning
trench
mortars
and
my
officers
would
be
very
pleased
if
you
would
have
a
look
at
their
latest
stunt
we
got
a
mortar
in
pigeon
wood
away
beyond
the
infantry
it
never
been
done
before
and
we
going
to
blow
old
fritz
out
of
kite
i
followed
him
into
the
blue
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
we
fell
in
with
a
young
officer
also
on
his
way
to
pigeon
wood
he
was
in
a
merry
mood
in
spite
of
harassing
fire
round
about
and
the
occasional
howl
of
a
he
kept
stopping
to
look
at
enormous
holes
in
the
ground
and
laughing
at
something
that
seemed
to
tickle
his
sense
of
humor
see
that
he
said
that
old
charlie
lowndes
at
another
pit
in
upheaved
earth
he
said
that
charlie
lowndes
again
old
charlie
gave
hell
he
a
topping
chap
you
must
meet
him
my
god
look
at
that
he
roared
with
laughter
again
on
the
edge
of
an
unusually
large
crater
who
is
charlie
i
asked
where
can
i
find
him
oh
we
shall
meet
him
in
pigeon
wood
he
as
pleased
as
punch
at
having
got
beyond
the
infantry
first
time
it
has
ever
been
done
took
a
bit
of
doing
too
with
the
largest
size
of
we
entered
pigeon
wood
after
a
long
walk
over
wild
chaos
and
guided
by
the
officer
and
sergeant
i
dived
down
into
a
deep
dugout
just
captured
from
the
germans
who
were
two
hundred
yards
away
in
kite
copse
what
cheer
charlie
shouted
the
young
officer
hullo
come
in
we
getting
gloriously
binged
on
a
rare
find
of
german
topping
and
i
brought
a
capt
charles
lowndes
dear
old
charlie
received
us
most
politely
in
one
of
the
best
dugouts
i
ever
saw
with
smoothly
paneled
walls
fitted
up
with
shelves
and
good
deal
furniture
made
to
match
this
is
a
nice
little
home
in
hell
said
charles
at
any
moment
of
course
we
may
be
blown
to
bits
but
meanwhile
it
is
very
comfy
down
here
and
what
makes
everything
good
is
a
bottle
of
rare
old
brandy
and
an
unlimited
supply
of
german
also
to
add
to
the
gaiety
of
indecent
minds
there
is
a
complete
outfit
of
ladies
clothing
in
a
neighboring
dugout
funny
fellows
those
german
officers
take
a
pew
wo
you
and
have
a
drink
orderly
he
shouted
for
his
man
and
ordered
a
further
supply
of
german
we
drank
to
the
confusion
of
the
enemy
in
his
own
brandy
and
out
of
his
own
mugs
sitting
on
his
own
chairs
at
his
own
table
and
dear
old
charlie
who
was
a
little
etoile
as
afterward
i
became
with
a
sense
of
deep
satisfaction
the
noise
of
shells
seemed
more
remote
discoursed
on
war
which
he
hated
german
psychology
barrages
they
had
simply
blown
the
boche
out
of
gommecourt
and
his
particular
fancy
stunt
of
stealing
a
march
on
the
infantry
who
said
captain
lowndes
are
laps
other
officers
crowded
into
the
dugout
one
of
them
said
you
must
come
round
to
mine
it
a
blasted
palace
and
i
went
round
later
and
he
told
me
on
the
way
that
he
had
escaped
so
often
from
that
he
thought
the
average
of
luck
was
up
and
he
was
bound
to
get
done
in
before
long
charlie
lowndes
dispensed
drinks
with
noble
generosity
there
was
much
laughter
among
us
and
afterward
we
went
upstairs
and
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
which
a
heavy
wet
mist
was
clinging
and
i
saw
the
section
play
the
devil
with
kite
copse
over
the
way
late
in
the
afternoon
i
took
my
leave
of
a
merry
company
in
that
outpost
of
our
line
and
wished
them
luck
a
few
shells
crashed
through
the
wood
as
i
left
but
i
was
disdainful
of
them
after
that
admirable
brandy
it
was
a
long
walk
back
to
funky
villas
not
without
the
interest
of
arithmetical
calculations
about
the
odds
of
luck
in
harassing
fire
but
a
thousand
yards
or
so
from
pigeon
wood
i
looked
back
and
saw
that
the
enemy
had
begun
to
take
heavy
shells
were
smashing
through
the
trees
there
ferociously
i
hoped
my
friends
were
safe
in
their
dugouts
again
and
i
thought
of
the
laughter
and
gallant
spirit
of
the
young
men
after
five
months
of
the
greatest
battles
in
the
history
of
the
world
it
seemed
to
me
wonderful
xx
i
have
described
what
happened
on
our
side
of
the
lines
our
fearful
losses
the
stream
of
wounded
that
came
back
day
by
day
the
shops
the
agony
in
men
souls
the
cases
the
welter
and
bewilderment
of
battle
the
shelling
of
our
own
troops
the
lack
of
communication
between
fighting
units
and
the
command
the
filth
and
stench
of
the
hideous
shambles
which
were
our
battlefields
but
to
complete
the
picture
of
that
human
conflict
in
the
somme
i
must
now
tell
what
happened
on
the
german
side
of
the
lines
as
i
was
able
to
piece
the
tale
together
from
german
prisoners
with
whom
i
talked
german
letters
which
i
found
in
their
abandoned
dugouts
and
documents
which
fell
into
the
hands
of
our
staff
officers
our
men
were
at
least
inspirited
by
the
knowledge
that
they
were
beating
their
enemy
back
in
spite
of
their
own
bloody
losses
the
germans
had
not
even
that
source
of
comfort
for
whatever
it
might
be
worth
under
barrage
fire
the
mistakes
of
our
generalship
the
inefficiency
of
our
were
not
greater
than
the
blunderings
of
the
german
high
command
and
their
problem
was
more
difficult
than
ours
because
of
the
weakness
of
their
reserves
owing
to
enormous
preoccupation
on
the
russian
front
the
agony
of
their
men
was
greater
than
ours
to
understand
the
german
situation
it
must
be
remembered
that
from
january
to
may
the
german
command
on
the
western
front
was
concentrating
all
its
energy
and
available
strength
in
and
gun
power
upon
the
attack
of
verdun
the
crown
prince
had
staked
his
reputation
upon
that
adventure
which
he
believed
would
end
in
the
capture
of
the
strongest
french
fortress
and
the
destruction
of
the
french
armies
he
demanded
men
and
more
men
until
every
unit
that
could
be
spared
from
other
fronts
of
the
line
had
been
thrown
into
that
furnace
divisions
were
called
in
from
other
theaters
of
war
and
increased
the
strength
on
the
western
front
to
a
total
of
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
divisions
but
the
months
passed
and
verdun
still
held
out
above
piles
of
german
corpses
on
its
slopes
and
in
june
germany
looked
east
and
saw
a
great
menace
the
russian
offensive
was
becoming
violent
german
generals
on
the
russian
fronts
sent
desperate
messages
for
help
send
us
more
men
they
said
and
from
the
western
front
four
divisions
containing
battalions
were
sent
to
them
they
must
have
been
sent
grudgingly
for
now
another
menace
threatened
the
enemy
and
it
was
ours
the
british
armies
were
getting
ready
to
strike
in
spite
of
verdun
france
still
had
men
enough
from
that
part
of
the
line
in
which
they
had
been
relieved
by
the
british
in
a
new
attack
it
was
our
offensive
that
the
german
command
feared
most
for
they
had
no
exact
knowledge
of
our
strength
or
of
the
quality
of
our
new
troops
they
knew
that
our
army
had
grown
prodigiously
since
the
assault
on
loos
nearly
a
year
before
they
had
heard
of
the
canadian
reinforcements
and
the
coming
of
the
australians
and
the
steady
increase
of
recruiting
in
england
and
month
by
month
they
had
heard
the
louder
roar
of
our
guns
along
the
line
and
had
seen
their
destructive
effect
spreading
and
becoming
more
terrible
they
knew
of
the
steady
quiet
concentration
of
batteries
and
divisions
on
the
west
and
south
of
the
ancre
the
german
command
expected
a
heavy
blow
and
prepared
for
it
but
as
yet
had
no
knowledge
of
the
driving
force
behind
it
what
confidence
they
had
of
being
able
to
resist
the
british
attack
was
based
upon
the
wonderful
strength
of
the
lines
which
they
had
been
digging
and
fortifying
since
the
autumn
of
the
first
year
of
war
impregnable
positions
they
had
called
them
the
inexperience
of
our
troops
their
own
immense
quantity
of
the
courage
and
skill
of
their
gunners
and
their
profound
belief
in
the
superiority
of
german
generalship
in
order
to
prevent
espionage
during
the
coming
struggle
and
to
conceal
the
movement
of
troops
and
guns
they
ordered
the
civil
populations
to
be
removed
from
villages
close
behind
their
positions
drew
cordons
of
military
police
across
the
country
picketed
crossroads
and
established
a
network
of
counter
espionage
to
prevent
any
leakage
of
information
to
inspire
the
german
troops
with
a
spirit
of
martial
fervor
not
easily
aroused
to
fever
pitch
after
the
bloody
losses
before
verdun
orders
of
the
day
were
issued
to
the
battalions
counseling
them
to
hold
fast
against
the
hated
english
who
stood
foremost
in
the
way
of
peace
that
was
the
gist
of
a
manifesto
by
prince
rupprecht
of
bavaria
which
i
found
in
a
dugout
at
montauban
and
promising
them
a
speedy
ending
to
the
war
great
stores
of
material
and
munitions
were
concentrated
at
and
dumps
ready
to
be
sent
up
to
the
and
the
perfection
of
german
organization
may
well
have
seemed
flawless
before
the
attack
began
when
they
began
they
found
that
in
heavies
and
in
expenditure
of
high
explosives
they
were
outclassed
they
were
startled
too
by
the
skill
and
accuracy
of
the
british
gunners
whom
they
had
scorned
as
amateurs
and
by
the
daring
of
our
airmen
who
flew
over
their
lines
with
the
utmost
audacity
spotting
for
the
guns
and
registering
on
batteries
communication
trenches
crossroads
and
every
vital
point
of
organization
in
the
german
working
opposite
the
british
lines
north
and
south
of
the
ancre
even
before
the
british
infantry
had
left
their
trenches
at
dawn
on
july
german
officers
behind
the
firing
lines
saw
with
anxiety
that
all
the
organization
which
had
worked
so
smoothly
in
times
of
ordinary
trench
warfare
was
now
working
only
in
a
hazardous
way
under
a
deadly
storm
of
shells
food
and
supplies
of
all
kinds
could
not
be
sent
up
to
trenches
without
many
casualties
and
sometimes
could
not
be
sent
up
at
all
telephone
wires
were
cut
and
communications
broken
between
the
front
and
headquarters
staffs
sent
up
to
report
were
killed
on
the
way
to
the
lines
troops
moving
forward
from
reserve
areas
came
under
heavy
fire
and
lost
many
men
before
arriving
in
the
support
trenches
prince
rupprecht
of
bavaria
sitting
aloof
from
all
this
in
personal
safety
must
have
known
before
july
that
his
resources
in
men
and
material
would
be
strained
to
the
uttermost
by
the
british
attack
but
he
could
take
a
broader
view
than
men
closer
to
the
scene
of
battle
and
taking
into
account
the
courage
of
his
troops
he
had
no
need
to
doubt
that
the
immense
strength
of
their
positions
dug
and
tunneled
beyond
the
power
of
high
explosives
the
number
of
his
the
concentration
of
his
artillery
and
the
rawness
of
the
british
troops
he
could
count
up
the
possible
cost
and
believe
that
in
spite
of
a
heavy
price
to
pay
there
would
be
no
break
in
his
lines
at
on
july
the
british
infantry
as
i
have
told
left
their
trenches
and
attacked
on
the
right
angle
down
from
gommecourt
beaumont
hamel
thiepval
ovillers
and
la
boisselle
and
eastward
from
fricourt
below
mametz
and
montauban
for
a
week
the
german
troops
bavarians
and
prussians
had
been
crouching
in
their
dugouts
listening
to
the
ceaseless
crashing
of
the
british
in
places
like
beaumont
hamel
the
men
down
in
the
deep
tunnels
some
of
them
large
enough
to
hold
a
battalion
and
a
half
were
safe
as
long
as
they
stayed
there
but
to
get
in
or
out
was
death
trenches
disappeared
into
a
sea
of
and
the
men
holding
them
for
some
men
had
to
stay
on
duty
there
were
blown
to
fragments
many
of
the
shallower
dugouts
were
smashed
in
by
heavy
shells
and
officers
and
men
lay
dead
there
as
i
saw
them
lying
on
the
first
days
of
july
in
fricourt
and
mametz
and
montauban
the
living
men
kept
their
courage
but
below
ground
under
that
tumult
of
bursting
shells
and
wrote
pitiful
letters
to
their
people
at
home
describing
the
horror
of
those
hours
we
are
quite
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
wrote
one
of
them
nothing
comes
to
us
no
letters
the
english
keep
such
a
barrage
on
our
approaches
it
is
terrible
evening
it
will
be
seven
days
since
this
bombardment
began
we
can
not
hold
out
much
longer
everything
is
shot
to
thirst
was
one
of
their
tortures
in
many
of
the
tunneled
shelters
there
was
food
enough
but
the
water
could
not
be
sent
up
the
german
soldiers
were
maddened
by
thirst
when
rain
fell
many
of
them
crawled
out
and
drank
filthy
water
mixed
with
yellow
and
then
were
killed
by
high
explosives
other
men
crept
out
careless
of
death
but
compelled
to
drink
they
crouched
over
the
bodies
of
the
men
who
lay
above
or
in
the
and
lapped
up
the
puddles
and
then
crawled
down
again
if
they
were
not
hit
when
our
infantry
attacked
at
gommecourt
and
beaumont
hamel
and
thiepval
they
were
received
by
waves
of
bullets
fired
by
men
who
in
spite
of
the
ordeal
of
our
seven
days
bombardment
came
out
into
the
open
now
at
the
moment
of
attack
which
they
knew
through
their
periscopes
was
coming
they
brought
their
guns
above
the
of
their
destroyed
trenches
under
our
barrage
and
served
them
they
ran
forward
even
into
no
man
land
and
planted
their
there
and
swept
down
our
men
as
they
charged
over
their
heads
the
german
gunners
flung
a
frightful
barrage
plowing
gaps
in
the
ranks
of
our
men
on
the
left
by
gommecourt
and
beaumont
hamel
the
british
attack
failed
as
i
have
told
but
southward
the
impregnable
lines
were
smashed
by
a
tide
of
british
soldiers
as
sand
castles
are
overwhelmed
by
the
waves
our
men
swept
up
to
fricourt
struck
straight
up
to
montauban
on
the
right
captured
it
and
flung
a
loop
round
mametz
village
for
the
german
generals
receiving
their
reports
with
great
difficulty
because
runners
were
killed
and
telephones
broken
the
question
was
how
will
these
british
troops
fight
in
the
open
after
their
first
assault
how
will
our
men
stand
between
the
first
line
and
the
second
as
far
as
the
german
troops
were
concerned
there
were
no
signs
of
cowardice
or
low
morale
as
we
called
it
more
kindly
in
those
early
days
of
the
struggle
they
fought
with
a
desperate
courage
holding
on
to
positions
in
rearguard
actions
when
our
guns
were
slashing
them
and
when
our
men
were
getting
near
to
them
making
us
pay
a
heavy
price
for
every
little
copse
or
gully
or
section
of
trench
and
above
all
serving
their
at
la
boisselle
ovillers
above
fricourt
round
contalmaison
and
at
all
points
of
their
gradual
retreat
with
a
wonderful
obstinacy
until
they
were
killed
or
captured
but
fresh
waves
of
british
soldiers
followed
those
who
were
checked
or
broken
after
the
first
week
of
battle
the
german
general
staff
had
learned
the
truth
about
the
qualities
of
those
british
new
armies
which
had
been
mocked
and
caricatured
in
german
comic
papers
they
learned
that
these
amateur
soldiers
had
the
qualities
of
the
finest
troops
in
the
world
not
only
extreme
valor
but
skill
and
cunning
not
only
a
great
power
of
endurance
under
the
heaviest
fire
but
a
spirit
of
attack
which
was
terrible
in
its
effect
they
were
fierce
bayonet
fighters
once
having
gained
a
bit
of
earth
or
a
ruined
village
nothing
would
budge
them
unless
they
could
be
blasted
out
by
general
sixt
von
arnim
put
down
some
candid
notes
in
his
report
to
prince
rupprecht
the
english
infantry
shows
great
dash
in
attack
a
factor
to
which
immense
confidence
in
its
overwhelming
artillery
greatly
contributes
it
has
shown
great
tenacity
in
defense
this
was
especially
noticeable
in
the
case
of
small
parties
which
when
once
established
with
in
the
corner
of
a
wood
or
a
group
of
houses
were
very
difficult
to
drive
the
german
losses
were
piling
up
the
agony
of
the
german
troops
under
our
was
reaching
unnatural
limits
of
torture
the
early
prisoners
i
saw
prussians
and
bavarians
of
the
reserve
corps
were
and
told
frightful
stories
of
the
way
in
which
their
regiments
had
been
cut
to
pieces
the
german
generals
had
to
fill
up
the
gaps
to
put
new
barriers
of
men
against
the
waves
of
british
infantry
they
flung
new
troops
into
the
line
called
up
hurriedly
from
reserve
depots
now
for
the
first
time
their
showed
signs
of
disorder
and
demoralization
when
the
prussian
guards
reserves
were
brought
up
from
valenciennes
to
counter
attack
at
contalmaison
they
were
sent
on
to
the
battlefield
without
maps
or
local
guides
and
walked
straight
into
our
barrage
a
whole
battalion
was
cut
to
pieces
and
many
others
suffered
frightful
things
some
of
the
prisoners
told
me
that
they
had
lost
of
their
number
in
casualties
and
our
troops
advanced
over
heaps
of
killed
and
wounded
the
bavarian
regiment
in
contalmaison
was
among
those
which
suffered
horribly
owing
to
our
ceaseless
they
could
get
no
and
no
water
the
dugouts
were
crowded
so
that
they
had
to
take
turns
to
get
into
these
shelters
and
outside
our
shells
were
bursting
over
every
yard
of
ground
those
who
went
outside
a
prisoner
told
me
were
killed
or
wounded
some
of
them
had
their
heads
blown
off
and
some
of
them
their
arms
but
we
went
on
taking
turns
in
the
hole
although
those
who
went
outside
knew
that
it
was
their
turn
to
die
most
likely
at
last
most
of
those
who
came
into
the
hole
were
wounded
some
of
them
badly
so
that
we
lay
in
that
is
one
little
picture
in
a
great
panorama
of
bloodshed
the
german
command
was
not
thinking
much
about
the
human
suffering
of
its
troops
it
was
thinking
of
the
next
defensive
line
upon
which
they
would
have
to
fall
back
if
the
pressure
of
the
british
offensive
could
be
maintained
the
line
it
was
getting
nervous
owing
to
the
enormous
efforts
made
in
the
verdun
offensive
the
supplies
of
ammunition
were
not
adequate
to
the
enormous
demand
the
german
gunners
were
trying
to
compete
with
the
british
in
continuity
of
bombardments
and
the
shells
were
running
short
guns
were
wearing
out
under
this
incessant
strain
and
it
was
difficult
to
replace
them
general
von
gallwitz
received
reports
of
an
alarmingly
large
number
of
bursts
in
the
bore
particularly
in
general
von
arnim
complained
that
reserve
supplies
of
ammunition
were
only
available
in
very
small
the
german
telephone
system
proved
totally
inadequate
in
consequence
of
the
development
which
the
fighting
the
german
air
service
was
surprisingly
weak
and
the
british
airmen
had
established
temporary
mastery
the
numerical
superiority
of
the
enemy
airmen
noted
general
von
arnim
and
the
fact
that
their
machines
were
better
made
became
disagreeably
apparent
to
us
particularly
in
their
direction
of
the
enemy
artillery
fire
and
in
on
july
the
british
troops
broke
the
german
second
line
at
longueval
and
the
bazentins
and
inflicted
great
losses
upon
the
enemy
who
fought
with
their
usual
courage
until
the
british
bayonets
were
among
them
a
day
or
two
later
the
fortress
of
ovillers
fell
and
the
remnants
of
the
garrison
one
hundred
and
fifty
strong
after
a
desperate
and
gallant
resistance
in
ditches
and
tunnels
where
they
had
fought
to
the
last
surrendered
with
honor
then
began
the
long
battle
of
the
woods
devil
wood
high
wood
trones
wood
continued
through
august
with
most
fierce
and
bloody
fighting
which
ended
in
our
favor
and
forced
the
enemy
back
gradually
but
steadily
in
spite
of
the
terrific
bombardments
which
filled
those
woods
with
and
the
constant
delivered
by
the
germans
came
the
order
from
the
german
staff
and
battalions
of
men
marched
out
obediently
to
certain
death
sometimes
with
incredible
folly
on
the
part
of
their
commanding
officers
who
ordered
these
attacks
to
be
made
without
the
slightest
chance
of
success
i
saw
an
example
of
that
at
close
range
during
a
battle
at
falfemont
farm
near
guillemont
our
men
had
advanced
from
wedge
wood
and
i
watched
them
from
a
trench
just
south
of
this
to
which
i
had
gone
at
a
great
pace
over
and
broken
wire
with
a
young
observing
officer
who
had
been
detailed
to
report
back
to
the
guns
old
falstaff
whose
songs
and
stories
had
filled
the
tent
under
the
red
cross
with
laughter
toiled
after
us
gallantly
but
grunting
and
sweating
under
the
sun
like
his
prototype
until
we
lost
him
in
our
hurry
presently
a
body
of
germans
came
out
of
a
copse
called
leuze
wood
on
rising
ground
faced
round
among
the
thin
slashed
trees
of
falfemont
and
advanced
toward
our
men
shoulder
to
shoulder
like
a
solid
bar
it
was
sheer
suicide
i
saw
our
men
get
their
machineguns
into
action
and
the
right
side
of
the
living
bar
frittered
away
and
then
the
whole
line
fell
into
the
scorched
grass
another
line
followed
they
were
tall
men
and
did
not
falter
as
they
came
forward
but
it
seemed
to
me
they
walked
like
men
conscious
of
going
to
death
they
died
the
simile
is
outworn
but
it
was
exactly
as
though
some
invisible
scythe
had
mown
them
down
in
all
the
letters
written
during
those
weeks
of
fighting
and
captured
by
us
from
dead
or
living
men
there
was
one
cry
of
agony
and
horror
i
stood
on
the
brink
of
the
most
terrible
days
of
my
life
wrote
one
of
them
they
were
those
of
the
battle
of
the
somme
it
began
with
a
night
attack
on
august
and
the
attack
lasted
till
the
evening
of
the
when
the
english
wrote
on
our
bodies
in
letters
of
blood
is
all
over
with
you
a
handful
of
wretched
creatures
worn
out
in
body
and
mind
were
all
that
was
left
of
a
whole
battalion
we
were
that
the
losses
of
many
of
the
german
battalions
were
staggering
yet
not
greater
than
our
own
and
by
the
middle
of
august
the
morale
of
the
troops
was
severely
shaken
the
division
by
pozires
suffered
very
heavily
the
reserve
and
regiments
each
lost
nearly
of
their
effectives
the
reserve
corps
had
also
lost
heavily
the
reserve
jager
battalion
lost
about
the
reserve
and
reserve
over
half
on
august
the
division
had
six
battalions
in
reserve
by
august
owing
to
the
large
number
of
casualties
the
greater
part
of
those
reserves
had
been
absorbed
into
the
front
and
support
trenches
leaving
as
available
reserves
two
exhausted
battalions
the
weakness
of
the
division
and
the
absolute
necessity
of
reinforcing
it
led
to
the
reserve
infantry
regiment
guards
division
being
brought
up
to
strengthen
the
right
flank
in
the
leipzig
salient
this
regiment
had
suffered
casualties
to
the
extent
of
over
percent
west
of
pozires
during
the
middle
of
july
and
showed
no
eagerness
to
return
to
the
fight
these
are
but
a
few
examples
of
what
was
happening
along
the
whole
of
the
german
front
on
the
somme
it
became
apparent
by
the
end
of
august
that
the
enemy
was
in
trouble
to
find
fresh
troops
to
relieve
his
exhausted
divisions
and
that
the
wastage
was
faster
than
the
arrival
of
new
men
it
was
noticeable
that
he
left
divisions
in
the
line
until
incapable
of
further
effort
rather
than
relieving
them
earlier
so
that
after
resting
they
might
again
be
brought
on
to
the
battlefield
the
only
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
was
that
the
enemy
had
not
sufficient
formations
available
to
make
the
necessary
reliefs
in
july
three
of
these
exhausted
divisions
were
sent
to
the
east
their
place
being
taken
by
two
new
divisions
and
in
august
three
more
exhausted
divisions
were
sent
to
russia
eight
new
divisions
coming
to
the
somme
front
the
british
and
french
offensive
was
drawing
in
all
the
german
reserves
and
draining
them
of
their
life
blood
we
entrained
at
savigny
wrote
a
man
of
one
of
these
regiments
and
at
once
knew
our
destination
it
was
our
old
the
in
many
letters
this
phrase
was
used
the
somme
was
called
the
bath
of
blood
by
the
german
troops
who
waded
across
its
and
in
the
ditches
which
were
heaped
with
their
dead
but
what
i
have
described
is
only
the
beginning
of
the
battle
and
the
bath
was
to
be
filled
deeper
in
the
months
that
followed
xxi
the
name
that
and
the
news
of
battle
could
not
be
hidden
from
the
people
of
germany
who
had
already
been
chilled
with
horror
by
the
losses
at
verdun
nor
from
the
soldiers
of
reserve
regiments
quartered
in
french
and
belgian
towns
like
valenciennes
quentin
cambrai
lille
bruges
and
as
far
back
as
brussels
waiting
to
go
to
the
front
nor
from
the
civil
population
of
those
towns
held
for
two
years
by
their
enemy
these
blond
young
men
who
lived
in
their
houses
marched
down
their
streets
and
made
love
to
their
women
the
news
was
brought
down
from
the
somme
front
by
red
cross
trains
arriving
in
endless
succession
and
packed
with
maimed
and
mangled
men
german
military
policemen
formed
cordons
round
the
railway
stations
pushed
back
civilians
who
came
to
stare
with
somber
eyes
at
these
blanketed
bundles
of
living
flesh
but
when
the
ambulances
rumbled
through
the
streets
toward
the
hospitals
long
processions
of
them
with
the
soles
of
men
boots
turned
up
over
the
stretchers
on
which
they
lay
quiet
and
stiff
the
tale
was
told
though
no
word
was
spoken
the
tale
of
defeat
of
great
losses
of
grave
and
increasing
anxiety
was
told
clearly
enough
as
i
read
in
captured
letters
by
the
faces
of
german
officers
who
went
about
in
these
towns
behind
the
lines
with
gloomy
looks
and
whose
tempers
never
of
the
sweetest
became
irritable
and
unbearable
so
that
the
soldiers
hated
them
for
all
this
cursing
and
bullying
a
certain
battalion
commander
had
a
nervous
breakdown
because
he
had
to
meet
his
colonel
in
the
morning
he
is
dying
with
fear
and
anxiety
wrote
one
of
his
comrades
other
men
not
battalion
commanders
were
even
more
afraid
of
their
superior
officers
upon
whom
this
bad
news
from
the
somme
had
an
evil
effect
the
bad
news
was
spread
by
divisions
taken
out
of
the
line
and
sent
back
to
rest
the
men
reported
that
their
battalions
had
been
cut
to
pieces
some
of
their
regiments
had
lost
of
their
strength
they
described
the
frightful
effect
of
the
british
artillery
the
smashed
trenches
the
the
horror
it
was
not
good
for
the
morale
of
men
who
were
just
going
up
there
to
take
their
turn
the
man
who
was
afraid
of
his
colonel
sits
all
day
long
writing
home
with
the
picture
of
his
wife
and
children
before
his
he
was
afraid
of
other
things
bavarian
soldiers
quarreled
with
prussians
accused
them
unjustly
of
shirking
the
somme
battlefields
and
leaving
the
bavarians
to
go
to
the
all
the
bavarian
troops
are
being
sent
to
the
somme
this
much
is
certain
you
can
see
no
prussians
there
and
this
in
spite
of
the
losses
the
bavarian
corps
suffered
recently
at
verdun
and
how
we
did
suffer
it
appears
that
we
are
in
for
another
turn
at
least
the
bavarian
division
everybody
has
been
talking
about
it
for
a
long
time
to
the
devil
with
it
every
bavarian
regiment
is
being
sent
into
it
and
it
a
it
was
in
no
cheerful
mood
that
men
went
away
to
the
somme
battlefields
those
battalions
of
men
entrained
without
any
of
the
old
enthusiasm
with
which
they
had
gone
to
earlier
battles
their
gloom
was
noticed
by
the
officers
sing
you
sheeps
heads
sing
they
shouted
they
were
compelled
to
sing
by
order
in
the
afternoon
wrote
a
man
of
the
reserve
division
we
had
to
go
out
again
we
were
to
learn
to
sing
the
greater
part
did
not
join
in
and
the
song
went
feebly
then
we
had
to
march
round
in
a
circle
and
sing
and
that
went
no
better
after
that
we
had
an
hour
off
and
on
the
way
back
to
billets
we
were
to
sing
uber
alles
but
this
broke
down
completely
one
never
hears
songs
of
the
fatherland
any
they
were
silent
men
who
marched
through
the
streets
of
french
and
belgian
towns
to
be
entrained
for
the
somme
front
for
they
had
forebodings
of
the
fate
before
them
yet
none
of
their
forebodings
were
equal
in
intensity
of
fear
to
the
frightful
reality
into
which
they
were
flung
the
journey
to
the
somme
front
on
the
german
side
was
a
way
of
terror
ugliness
and
death
not
all
the
imagination
of
morbid
minds
searching
obscenely
for
foulness
and
blood
in
the
great
deep
pits
of
human
agony
could
surpass
these
scenes
along
the
way
to
the
german
lines
round
courcelette
and
flers
gueudecourt
morval
and
lesboeufs
many
times
long
before
a
german
battalion
had
arrived
near
the
trenches
it
was
but
a
collection
of
nerve
broken
men
bemoaning
losses
already
suffered
far
behind
the
lines
and
filled
with
hideous
apprehension
for
british
guns
were
hurling
high
explosives
into
distant
villages
barraging
crossroads
reaching
out
to
and
while
british
airmen
were
on
bombing
flights
over
railway
stations
and
and
highroads
down
which
the
german
troops
came
marching
at
cambrai
bapaume
in
the
valley
between
irles
and
warlencourt
at
busigny
and
many
other
places
on
the
lines
of
route
german
soldiers
arriving
one
morning
at
cambrai
by
train
found
themselves
under
the
fire
of
a
single
airplane
which
flew
very
low
and
dropped
bombs
they
exploded
with
heavy
crashes
and
one
bomb
hit
the
first
carriage
behind
the
engine
killing
and
wounding
several
men
a
second
bomb
hit
the
station
buildings
and
there
was
a
clatter
of
broken
glass
the
rending
of
wood
and
the
fall
of
bricks
all
lights
went
out
and
the
german
soldiers
groped
about
in
the
darkness
amid
the
splinters
of
glass
and
the
fallen
bricks
searching
for
the
wounded
by
the
sound
of
their
groans
it
was
but
one
scene
along
the
way
to
that
through
which
they
had
to
wade
to
the
trenches
of
the
somme
flights
of
british
airplanes
circled
over
the
villages
on
the
way
at
grevilliers
in
august
eleven
bombs
fell
in
the
market
square
so
that
the
center
of
the
village
collapsed
in
a
state
of
ruin
burying
soldiers
billeted
there
every
day
the
british
airmen
paid
these
visits
meeting
the
germans
far
up
the
roads
on
their
way
to
the
somme
and
swooping
over
them
like
a
flying
death
even
on
the
march
in
open
country
the
german
soldiers
tramping
silently
along
not
singing
in
spite
of
orders
were
bombed
and
shot
at
by
these
british
aviators
who
flew
down
very
low
pouring
out
streams
of
bullets
the
germans
lost
their
nerve
at
such
times
and
scattered
into
the
ditches
falling
over
one
another
struck
and
cursed
by
their
unteroffizieren
and
leaving
their
dead
and
wounded
in
the
roadway
as
the
roads
went
nearer
to
the
battlefields
they
were
choked
with
the
traffic
of
war
with
artillery
and
transport
wagons
and
horse
ambulances
and
always
thousands
of
gray
men
marching
up
to
the
lines
or
back
from
them
exhausted
and
broken
after
many
days
in
the
fires
of
hell
up
there
officers
sat
on
their
horses
by
the
roadside
directing
all
the
traffic
with
the
usual
swearing
and
cursing
and
rode
alongside
the
transport
wagons
and
the
troops
urging
them
forward
at
a
quicker
pace
because
of
stern
orders
received
from
headquarters
demanding
quicker
movement
the
reserves
it
seemed
were
desperately
wanted
up
in
the
lines
the
english
were
attacking
again
god
alone
knew
what
was
happening
regiments
had
lost
their
way
wounded
were
pouring
back
officers
had
gone
mad
into
the
midst
of
all
this
turmoil
shells
fell
shells
from
guns
transport
wagons
were
blown
to
bits
the
bodies
and
fragments
of
artillery
horses
lay
all
over
the
roads
men
lay
dead
or
bleeding
under
the
debris
of
and
broken
bricks
above
all
the
noise
of
this
confusion
and
death
in
the
night
the
hard
stern
voices
of
german
officers
rang
out
and
german
discipline
prevailed
and
men
marched
on
to
greater
perils
they
were
in
the
now
and
sometimes
a
regiment
on
the
march
was
tracked
all
along
the
way
by
british
directed
from
airplanes
and
captive
balloons
it
was
the
fate
of
a
captured
officer
i
met
who
had
detrained
at
bapaume
for
the
trenches
at
contalmaison
at
bapaume
his
battalion
was
hit
by
fragments
of
shells
nearer
to
the
line
they
came
under
the
fire
of
and
shells
found
them
somewhere
by
bazentin
at
contalmaison
they
marched
into
a
barrage
and
here
the
officer
was
taken
prisoner
of
his
battalion
there
were
few
men
left
it
was
so
with
the
jager
battalion
ordered
up
hurriedly
to
make
a
near
flers
they
suffered
so
heavily
on
the
way
to
the
trenches
that
no
attack
could
be
made
the
had
all
the
work
to
do
the
way
up
to
the
trenches
became
more
tragic
as
every
kilometer
was
passed
until
the
stench
of
corruption
was
wafted
on
the
wind
so
that
men
were
sickened
and
tried
not
to
breathe
and
marched
hurriedly
to
get
on
the
lee
side
of
its
foulness
they
walked
now
through
places
which
had
once
been
villages
but
were
sinister
ruins
where
death
lay
in
wait
for
german
soldiers
it
seems
queer
to
me
wrote
one
of
them
that
whole
villages
close
to
the
front
look
as
flattened
as
a
child
toy
run
over
by
a
not
one
stone
remains
on
another
the
streets
are
one
line
of
shell
holes
add
to
that
the
thunder
of
the
guns
and
you
will
see
with
what
feelings
we
come
into
the
line
into
trenches
where
for
months
shells
of
all
caliber
have
rained
flers
is
a
scrap
again
and
again
men
lost
their
way
up
to
the
lines
the
reliefs
could
only
be
made
at
night
lest
they
should
be
discovered
by
british
airmen
and
british
gunners
and
even
if
these
german
soldiers
had
trench
maps
the
guidance
was
but
little
good
when
many
trenches
had
been
smashed
in
and
only
could
be
found
in
the
front
line
of
flers
wrote
one
of
these
germans
the
men
were
only
occupying
behind
there
was
the
intense
smell
of
putrefaction
which
filled
the
trench
almost
unbearably
the
corpses
lie
either
quite
insufficiently
covered
with
earth
on
the
edge
of
the
trench
or
quite
close
under
the
bottom
of
the
trench
so
that
the
earth
lets
the
stench
through
in
some
places
bodies
lie
quite
uncovered
in
a
trench
recess
and
no
one
seems
to
trouble
about
them
one
sees
horrible
pictures
here
an
arm
here
a
foot
here
a
head
sticking
out
of
the
earth
and
these
are
all
german
not
far
from
us
at
the
entrance
to
a
dugout
nine
men
were
buried
of
whom
three
were
dead
all
along
the
trench
men
kept
on
getting
buried
what
had
been
a
perfect
trench
a
few
hours
before
was
in
parts
completely
blown
in
the
men
are
getting
weaker
it
is
impossible
to
hold
out
any
longer
losses
can
no
longer
be
reckoned
accurately
without
a
doubt
many
of
our
people
are
that
is
only
one
out
of
thousands
of
such
gruesome
pictures
true
as
the
death
they
described
true
to
the
pictures
on
our
side
of
the
line
as
on
their
side
which
went
back
to
german
homes
during
the
battles
of
the
somme
those
german
soldiers
were
great
and
men
sitting
in
wet
ditches
in
as
they
called
their
dugouts
up
to
my
waist
in
mud
as
one
of
them
described
scribbled
pitiful
things
which
they
hoped
might
reach
their
people
at
home
as
a
voice
from
the
dead
for
they
had
had
little
hope
of
escape
from
the
blood
bath
when
you
get
this
i
shall
be
a
corpse
wrote
one
of
them
and
one
finds
the
same
foreboding
in
many
of
these
documents
even
the
lucky
ones
who
could
get
some
cover
from
the
incessant
bombardment
by
english
guns
began
to
lose
their
nerves
after
a
day
or
two
they
were
always
in
fear
of
british
infantry
sweeping
upon
them
suddenly
behind
the
trommelfeuer
rushing
their
dugouts
with
bombs
and
bayonets
sentries
became
jumpy
and
signaled
attacks
when
there
were
no
attacks
the
gas
alarm
was
sounded
constantly
by
the
clang
of
a
bell
in
the
trench
and
men
put
on
their
heavy
and
sat
in
them
until
they
were
nearly
stifled
here
is
a
little
picture
of
life
in
a
german
dugout
near
the
british
lines
written
by
a
man
now
dead
the
telephone
bell
rings
you
there
yes
here
nau
battalion
that
is
all
then
that
ceases
and
now
the
wire
is
in
again
perhaps
for
the
or
thirtieth
time
thus
the
night
is
interrupted
and
now
they
come
alarm
messages
one
after
the
other
each
more
terrifying
than
the
other
of
enormous
losses
through
the
bombs
and
shells
of
the
enemy
of
huge
masses
of
troops
advancing
upon
us
of
all
possible
possibilities
such
as
a
train
broken
down
and
we
are
tortured
by
all
the
terrors
that
the
mind
can
invent
our
nerves
quiver
we
clench
our
teeth
none
of
us
can
forget
the
horrors
of
the
heavy
rain
fell
and
the
dugouts
became
wet
and
filthy
our
were
full
of
water
we
had
to
try
and
bail
out
the
trenches
with
i
lay
down
in
the
water
with
we
were
to
have
worked
on
dugouts
but
not
a
soul
could
do
any
more
only
a
few
sections
got
coffee
mine
got
nothing
at
all
i
was
frozen
in
every
limb
poured
the
water
out
of
my
boots
and
lay
down
our
men
suffered
exactly
the
same
things
but
did
not
write
about
them
the
german
generals
and
their
staffs
could
not
be
quite
indifferent
to
all
this
welter
of
human
suffering
among
their
troops
in
spite
of
the
cold
scientific
spirit
with
which
they
regarded
the
problem
of
war
the
agony
of
the
individual
soldier
would
not
trouble
them
there
is
no
war
without
agony
but
the
psychology
of
masses
of
men
had
to
be
considered
because
it
affects
the
efficiency
of
the
machine
the
german
general
staff
on
the
western
front
was
becoming
seriously
alarmed
by
the
declining
morale
of
its
infantry
under
the
increasing
strain
of
the
british
attacks
and
adopted
stern
measures
to
cure
it
but
it
could
not
hope
to
cure
the
heaps
of
german
dead
who
were
lying
on
the
battlefields
nor
the
maimed
men
who
were
being
carried
back
to
the
dressing
stations
nor
to
bring
back
the
prisoners
taken
in
droves
by
the
french
and
british
troops
before
the
attack
on
the
flers
line
the
capture
of
thiepval
and
the
german
debacle
at
beaumont
hamel
in
november
the
enemy
command
was
already
filled
with
a
grave
anxiety
at
the
enormous
losses
of
its
fighting
strength
was
compelled
to
adopt
new
expedients
for
increasing
the
number
of
its
divisions
it
was
forced
to
withdraw
troops
badly
needed
on
other
fronts
and
the
successive
shocks
of
the
british
offensive
reached
as
far
as
germany
itself
so
that
the
whole
of
its
recruiting
system
had
to
be
revised
to
fill
up
the
gaps
torn
out
of
the
german
ranks
xxii
all
through
july
and
august
the
enemy
troops
fought
with
wonderful
and
stubborn
courage
defending
every
bit
of
broken
woodland
every
heap
of
bricks
that
was
once
a
village
every
line
of
trenches
smashed
by
heavy
with
obstinacy
it
is
indeed
fair
and
just
to
say
that
throughout
those
battles
of
the
somme
our
men
fought
against
an
enemy
hard
to
beat
grim
and
resolute
and
inspired
sometimes
with
the
courage
of
despair
which
was
hardly
less
dangerous
than
the
courage
of
hope
the
australians
who
struggled
to
get
the
high
ground
at
pozieres
did
not
have
an
easy
task
the
enemy
made
many
against
them
all
the
ground
thereabouts
was
as
i
have
said
so
smashed
that
the
earth
became
finely
powdered
and
it
was
the
arena
of
bloody
fighting
at
close
quarters
which
did
not
last
a
day
or
two
but
many
weeks
mouquet
farm
was
like
the
phoenix
which
rose
again
out
of
its
ashes
in
its
tunneled
ways
german
soldiers
hid
and
came
out
to
fight
our
men
in
the
rear
long
after
the
site
of
the
farm
was
in
our
hands
but
the
german
troops
were
fighting
what
they
knew
to
be
a
losing
battle
they
were
fighting
actions
trying
to
gain
time
for
the
hasty
digging
of
ditches
behind
them
trying
to
sell
their
lives
at
the
highest
price
they
lived
not
only
under
incessant
gradually
weakening
their
working
a
physical
as
well
as
a
moral
change
in
them
but
in
constant
terror
of
british
attacks
they
could
never
be
sure
of
safety
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
even
in
their
deepest
dugouts
the
british
varied
their
times
of
attack
at
dawn
at
noon
when
the
sun
was
reddening
in
the
west
just
before
the
dusk
in
pitch
darkness
even
the
steady
regular
bombardment
that
had
never
ceased
all
through
the
days
and
nights
would
concentrate
into
the
great
tumult
of
sudden
and
presently
waves
of
men
english
or
scottish
or
irish
australians
or
canadians
would
be
sweeping
on
to
them
and
over
them
rummaging
down
into
the
dugouts
with
bombs
and
bayonets
gathering
up
prisoners
quick
to
kill
if
men
were
not
quick
to
surrender
in
this
way
thiepval
was
encircled
so
that
the
garrison
there
the
regiment
who
had
held
it
for
two
years
knew
that
they
were
doomed
in
this
way
guillemont
and
ginchy
fell
so
that
in
the
first
place
hardly
a
man
out
of
two
thousand
men
escaped
to
tell
the
tale
of
horror
in
german
lines
and
in
the
second
place
there
was
no
long
fight
against
the
irish
who
stormed
it
in
a
wild
fierce
rush
which
even
could
not
check
the
german
general
staff
was
getting
flurried
grabbing
at
battalions
from
other
parts
of
the
line
disorganizing
its
divisions
under
the
urgent
need
of
flinging
in
men
to
stop
this
rot
in
the
lines
ordering
which
were
without
any
chance
of
success
so
that
thin
waves
of
men
came
out
into
the
open
as
i
saw
them
several
times
to
be
swept
down
by
scythes
of
bullets
which
cut
them
clean
to
the
earth
before
september
they
hoped
that
the
british
offensive
was
wearing
itself
out
it
seemed
to
them
at
least
doubtful
that
after
the
struggle
of
two
and
a
half
months
the
british
troops
could
still
have
spirit
and
strength
enough
to
fling
themselves
against
new
lines
but
the
machinery
of
their
defense
was
crumbling
many
of
their
guns
had
worn
out
and
could
not
be
replaced
quickly
enough
many
batteries
had
been
knocked
out
in
their
emplacements
along
the
line
of
bazentin
and
longueval
before
the
artillery
was
drawn
back
to
and
a
new
line
of
safety
battalion
commanders
clamored
for
greater
supplies
of
signal
rockets
and
all
kinds
of
fighting
material
enormously
in
excess
of
all
previous
requirements
the
difficulties
of
dealing
with
the
wounded
who
littered
the
battlefields
and
choked
the
roads
with
the
traffic
of
ambulances
became
increasingly
severe
owing
to
the
dearth
of
horses
for
transport
and
the
longer
range
of
british
guns
which
had
been
brought
far
forward
the
german
general
staff
studied
its
next
lines
of
defense
away
through
courcelette
martinpuich
lesboeufs
morval
and
combles
and
they
did
not
look
too
good
but
with
luck
and
the
courage
of
german
soldiers
and
the
exhaustion
surely
those
fellows
were
exhausted
of
british
troops
good
enough
on
september
the
german
command
had
another
shock
when
the
whole
line
of
the
british
troops
on
the
somme
front
south
of
the
ancre
rose
out
of
their
trenches
and
swept
over
the
german
defenses
in
a
tide
those
defenses
broke
hopelessly
and
the
waves
dashed
through
here
and
there
as
on
the
german
left
at
morval
and
lesboeufs
the
bulwarks
stood
for
a
time
but
the
british
pressed
against
them
and
round
them
on
the
german
right
below
the
little
river
of
the
ancre
courcelette
fell
and
martinpuich
and
at
last
as
i
have
written
high
wood
which
the
germans
desired
to
hold
at
all
costs
and
had
held
against
incessant
attacks
by
great
concentration
of
artillery
was
captured
and
left
behind
by
the
london
men
a
new
engine
of
war
had
come
as
a
demoralizing
influence
among
german
troops
spreading
terror
among
them
on
the
first
day
out
of
the
tanks
for
the
first
time
the
germans
were
outwitted
in
inventions
of
destruction
they
who
had
been
foremost
in
all
engines
of
death
it
was
the
moment
of
real
panic
in
the
german
lines
a
panic
reaching
back
from
the
troops
to
the
high
command
ten
days
later
on
september
when
the
british
made
a
new
advance
all
this
time
the
french
were
pressing
forward
too
on
our
right
by
roye
combles
was
evacuated
without
a
fight
and
with
a
litter
of
dead
in
its
streets
gueudecourt
lesboeufs
and
morval
were
lost
by
the
germans
and
a
day
later
thiepval
the
greatest
fortress
position
next
to
beaumont
hamel
fell
with
all
its
garrison
taken
prisoners
they
were
black
days
in
the
german
headquarters
where
heard
the
news
over
their
telephones
and
sent
stern
orders
to
artillery
commanders
and
divisional
generals
and
after
dictating
new
instructions
that
certain
trench
systems
must
be
held
at
whatever
price
heard
that
already
they
were
lost
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
morale
of
the
german
troops
on
the
somme
front
showed
most
signs
of
breaking
in
spite
of
all
their
courage
the
ordeal
had
been
too
hideous
for
them
and
in
spite
of
all
their
discipline
the
iron
discipline
of
the
german
soldier
they
were
on
the
edge
of
revolt
the
intimate
and
undoubted
facts
of
this
break
in
the
morale
of
the
enemy
troops
during
this
period
reveal
a
pitiful
picture
of
human
agony
we
are
now
fighting
on
the
somme
with
the
english
wrote
a
man
of
the
bavarian
regiment
you
can
no
longer
call
it
war
it
is
mere
murder
we
are
at
the
of
the
present
battle
in
foureaux
wood
near
guillemont
all
my
previous
experiences
in
this
war
the
slaughter
at
ypres
and
the
battle
in
the
at
hulluch
are
the
purest
child
play
compared
with
this
massacre
and
that
is
much
too
mild
a
description
i
hardly
think
they
will
bring
us
into
the
fight
again
for
we
are
in
a
very
bad
from
september
to
we
were
on
the
somme
wrote
a
man
of
the
bavarians
and
my
regiment
had
fifteen
hundred
a
detailed
picture
of
the
german
losses
under
our
bombardment
was
given
in
the
diary
of
an
officer
captured
in
a
trench
near
flers
and
dated
september
the
four
days
ending
september
spent
in
the
trenches
were
characterized
by
a
continual
enemy
bombardment
that
did
not
abate
for
a
single
instant
the
enemy
had
registered
on
our
trenches
with
light
as
well
as
medium
and
heavy
batteries
notwithstanding
that
he
had
no
direct
observation
from
his
trenches
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
the
summit
his
registering
was
done
by
his
excellent
air
service
which
renders
perfect
reports
of
everything
observed
during
the
first
day
for
instance
whenever
the
slightest
movement
was
visible
in
our
trenches
during
the
presence
as
is
usually
the
case
of
enemy
aircraft
flying
as
low
as
three
and
four
hundred
yards
a
heavy
bombardment
of
the
particular
section
took
place
the
very
heavy
losses
during
the
first
day
brought
about
the
resolution
to
evacuate
the
trenches
during
the
daytime
only
a
small
garrison
was
left
the
remainder
withdrawing
to
a
part
of
the
line
on
the
left
of
the
road
the
signal
for
a
bombardment
by
was
given
by
the
english
airplanes
on
the
first
day
we
tried
to
fire
by
platoons
on
the
airplanes
but
a
second
airplane
retaliated
by
dropping
bombs
and
firing
his
at
our
troops
our
own
airmen
appeared
only
once
for
a
short
time
behind
our
lines
while
many
airplanes
are
observing
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
our
own
hardly
ever
venture
near
the
opinion
is
that
our
trenches
can
not
protect
troops
during
a
barrage
of
the
shortest
duration
owing
to
lack
of
dugouts
the
enemy
understands
how
to
prevent
with
his
terrible
barrage
the
bringing
up
of
building
material
and
even
how
to
hinder
the
work
itself
the
consequence
is
that
our
trenches
are
always
ready
for
an
assault
on
his
part
our
artillery
which
does
occasionally
put
a
heavy
barrage
on
the
enemy
trenches
at
a
great
expense
of
ammunition
can
not
cause
similar
destruction
to
him
he
can
bring
his
building
material
up
can
repair
his
trenches
as
well
as
build
new
ones
can
bring
up
rations
and
ammunition
and
remove
the
wounded
the
continual
barrage
on
our
lines
of
communication
makes
it
very
difficult
for
us
to
ration
and
relieve
our
troops
to
supply
water
ammunition
and
building
material
to
evacuate
wounded
and
causes
heavy
losses
this
and
the
lack
of
protection
from
artillery
fire
and
the
weather
the
lack
of
hot
meals
the
continual
necessity
of
lying
still
in
the
same
place
the
danger
of
being
buried
the
long
time
the
wounded
have
to
remain
in
the
trenches
and
chiefly
the
terrible
effect
of
the
machine
and
fire
controlled
by
an
excellent
air
service
has
a
most
demoralizing
effect
on
the
troops
only
with
the
greatest
difficulty
could
the
men
be
persuaded
to
stay
in
the
trenches
under
those
there
were
some
who
could
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
if
they
could
see
any
chance
of
deserting
or
malingering
for
the
first
time
on
our
front
the
german
officers
could
not
trust
the
courage
of
their
men
nor
their
loyalty
nor
their
sense
of
discipline
all
this
horror
of
men
blown
to
bits
over
living
men
of
trenches
heaped
with
dead
and
dying
was
stronger
than
courage
stronger
than
loyalty
stronger
than
discipline
a
moral
rot
was
threatening
to
bring
the
german
troops
on
the
somme
front
to
disaster
large
numbers
of
men
reported
sick
and
tried
by
every
kind
of
trick
to
be
sent
back
to
base
hospitals
in
the
bavarian
division
desertions
were
frequent
and
several
times
whole
bodies
of
men
refused
to
go
forward
into
the
front
line
the
morale
of
men
in
the
regiment
taken
at
courcelette
seemed
to
be
very
weak
one
of
the
prisoners
declared
that
they
gave
themselves
up
without
firing
a
shot
because
they
could
trust
the
english
not
to
kill
them
the
platoon
commander
had
gone
away
and
the
prisoner
was
ordered
to
alarm
the
platoon
in
case
of
attack
but
did
not
do
so
on
purpose
they
did
not
shoot
with
rifles
or
and
did
not
throw
bombs
many
of
the
german
officers
were
as
demoralized
as
the
men
shirking
their
posts
in
the
trenches
shamming
sickness
and
even
leading
the
way
to
surrender
prisoners
of
the
regiment
which
lost
thirteen
hundred
men
in
fifteen
days
told
of
officers
who
had
refused
to
take
their
men
up
to
the
and
of
whole
companies
who
had
declined
to
move
when
ordered
to
do
so
an
officer
of
the
landwehr
regiment
is
said
by
prisoners
to
have
told
his
men
during
our
preliminary
bombardment
to
surrender
as
soon
as
we
attacked
a
german
regimental
order
says
i
must
state
with
the
greatest
regret
that
the
regiment
during
this
change
of
position
had
to
take
notice
of
the
sad
fact
that
men
of
four
of
the
companies
inspired
by
shameful
cowardice
left
their
companies
on
their
own
initiative
and
did
not
move
into
another
order
contains
the
same
fact
and
a
warning
of
what
punishment
may
be
meted
out
proofs
are
multiplying
of
men
leaving
the
position
without
permission
and
hiding
at
the
rear
it
is
our
duty
each
at
his
post
to
deal
with
this
fact
with
energy
and
many
bavarians
complained
that
their
officers
did
not
accompany
them
into
the
trenches
but
went
down
to
the
hospitals
with
imaginary
diseases
in
any
case
there
was
a
great
deal
of
real
sickness
mental
and
physical
the
ranks
were
depleted
by
men
suffering
from
fever
pleurisy
jaundice
and
stomach
complaints
of
all
kinds
twisted
up
with
rheumatism
after
lying
in
waterlogged
holes
lamed
for
life
by
bad
cases
of
and
so
that
they
could
do
nothing
but
weep
the
nervous
cases
were
the
worst
and
in
greatest
number
many
men
went
raving
mad
the
victims
clawed
at
their
mouths
unceasingly
or
lay
motionless
like
corpses
with
staring
eyes
or
trembled
in
every
limb
moaning
miserably
and
afflicted
with
a
great
terror
to
the
germans
barely
less
to
british
troops
the
somme
battlefields
were
not
only
shambles
but
a
territory
which
the
devil
claimed
as
his
own
for
the
torture
of
men
brains
and
souls
before
they
died
in
the
furnace
fires
a
spirit
of
revolt
against
all
this
crept
into
the
minds
of
men
who
retained
their
sanity
a
revolt
against
the
people
who
had
ordained
this
vast
outrage
against
god
and
humanity
into
german
letters
there
crept
bitter
burning
words
against
the
millionaires
who
grow
rich
out
of
the
war
against
the
high
people
who
live
in
comfort
behind
the
lines
letters
from
home
inflamed
these
thoughts
it
was
not
good
reading
for
men
under
it
seems
that
you
soldiers
fight
so
that
official
can
treat
us
as
female
criminals
tell
me
dear
husband
are
you
a
criminal
when
you
fight
in
the
trenches
or
why
do
people
treat
women
and
children
here
as
such
for
the
poor
here
it
is
terrible
and
yet
the
rich
the
gilded
ones
the
bloated
aristocrats
gobble
up
everything
in
front
of
our
very
eyes
all
soldiers
friend
and
foe
ought
to
throw
down
their
weapons
and
go
on
strike
so
that
this
war
which
enslaves
the
people
more
than
ever
may
thousands
of
letters
all
in
this
strain
were
reaching
the
german
soldiers
on
the
somme
and
they
did
not
strengthen
the
morale
of
men
already
victims
of
terror
and
despair
behind
the
lines
deserters
were
shot
in
batches
to
those
in
front
came
orders
of
the
day
warning
them
exhorting
them
commanding
them
to
hold
fast
to
the
hesitating
and
in
the
regiment
says
one
of
these
orders
i
would
say
the
following
what
the
englishman
can
do
the
german
can
do
also
or
if
on
the
other
hand
the
englishman
really
is
a
better
and
superior
being
he
would
be
quite
justified
in
his
aim
as
regards
this
war
the
extermination
of
the
german
there
is
a
further
point
to
be
noted
this
is
the
first
time
we
have
been
in
the
line
on
the
somme
and
what
is
more
we
are
there
at
a
time
when
things
are
more
calm
the
english
regiments
opposing
us
have
been
in
the
for
the
second
and
in
some
cases
even
the
third
time
heads
up
and
play
the
man
it
was
easy
to
write
such
documents
it
was
more
difficult
to
bring
up
reserves
of
men
and
ammunition
the
german
command
was
harder
pressed
by
the
end
of
september
from
july
to
september
according
to
trustworthy
information
german
divisions
in
all
were
engaged
against
the
allies
on
the
somme
battlefront
out
of
these
fourteen
were
still
in
the
line
on
september
had
been
withdrawn
broken
and
exhausted
to
quieter
areas
eleven
more
had
been
withdrawn
to
under
the
allies
artillery
fire
and
infantry
attacks
the
average
life
of
a
german
division
as
a
unit
fit
for
service
on
the
somme
was
nineteen
days
more
than
two
new
german
divisions
had
to
be
brought
into
the
every
week
since
the
end
of
june
to
replace
those
smashed
in
the
process
of
resisting
the
allied
attack
in
november
it
was
reckoned
by
competent
observers
in
the
field
that
well
over
one
hundred
and
twenty
german
divisions
had
been
passed
through
the
ordeal
of
the
somme
this
number
including
those
which
have
appeared
there
more
than
once
xxiii
by
september
when
the
british
troops
made
another
attack
the
morale
of
the
german
troops
was
reaching
its
lowest
ebb
except
on
their
right
at
beaumont
hamel
and
beaucourt
they
were
far
beyond
the
great
system
of
protective
dugouts
which
had
given
them
a
sense
of
safety
before
july
their
second
and
third
lines
of
defense
had
been
carried
and
they
were
existing
in
and
trenches
hastily
scraped
up
under
ceaseless
artillery
fire
the
horrors
of
the
battlefield
were
piled
up
to
heights
of
agony
and
terror
living
men
dwelt
among
the
unburied
dead
made
their
way
to
the
over
heaps
of
corpses
breathed
in
the
smell
of
human
corruption
and
had
always
in
their
ears
the
cries
of
the
wounded
they
could
not
rescue
they
wrote
these
things
in
tragic
letters
thousands
of
them
which
never
reached
their
homes
in
germany
but
lay
in
their
captured
ditches
the
number
of
dead
lying
about
is
awful
one
stumbles
over
the
stench
of
the
dead
lying
round
us
is
we
are
no
longer
men
here
we
are
worse
than
it
is
hell
let
it
is
we
lived
in
if
the
dear
ones
at
home
could
see
all
this
perhaps
there
would
be
a
change
but
they
are
never
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
guns
is
driving
us
poor
pitiful
letters
out
of
their
cries
of
agony
one
gets
to
the
real
truth
of
glory
and
the
splendor
of
it
preached
by
the
german
philosophers
and
british
jingoes
who
upheld
it
as
the
great
strengthening
tonic
for
their
race
and
as
the
noblest
experience
of
men
every
line
these
german
soldiers
wrote
might
have
been
written
by
one
of
ours
from
both
sides
of
the
shifting
lines
there
was
the
same
death
and
the
same
hell
behind
the
lines
the
german
general
staff
counting
up
the
losses
of
battalions
and
divisions
who
staggered
out
weakly
performed
juggling
tricks
with
what
reserves
it
could
lay
its
hands
on
and
flung
up
stray
units
to
relieve
the
poor
wretches
in
the
trenches
many
of
those
reliefs
lost
their
way
in
going
up
and
came
up
late
already
shattered
by
the
through
which
they
passed
our
position
wrote
a
german
infantry
officer
was
of
course
quite
different
from
what
we
had
been
told
our
company
alone
relieved
a
whole
battalion
we
had
been
told
we
were
to
relieve
a
company
of
fifty
men
weakened
by
casualties
the
men
we
relieved
had
no
idea
where
the
enemy
was
how
far
off
he
was
or
whether
any
of
our
own
troops
were
in
front
of
us
we
got
no
idea
of
our
support
position
until
six
this
evening
the
english
are
four
hundred
yards
away
by
the
windmill
over
the
one
german
soldier
wrote
that
the
british
seem
to
relieve
their
infantry
very
quickly
while
the
german
commands
work
on
the
principle
of
relieving
only
in
the
direst
need
and
leaving
the
divisions
in
as
long
as
another
wrote
that
the
leadership
of
the
divisions
really
fell
through
for
the
most
part
we
did
not
get
orders
and
the
regiment
had
to
manage
as
best
it
could
if
orders
arrived
they
generally
came
too
late
or
were
dealt
out
the
green
table
without
knowledge
of
the
conditions
in
front
so
that
to
carry
them
out
was
all
this
was
a
sign
of
demoralization
not
only
among
the
troops
who
were
doing
the
fighting
and
the
suffering
but
among
the
organizing
generals
behind
who
were
directing
the
operations
the
continual
of
the
british
and
french
armies
on
the
somme
battlefields
strained
the
german
on
the
western
front
almost
to
it
seemed
as
though
a
real
debacle
might
happen
and
that
they
would
be
forced
to
effect
a
general
retreat
a
withdrawal
more
or
less
at
ease
or
a
retirement
under
pressure
from
the
enemy
but
they
had
luck
astonishing
luck
at
the
very
time
when
the
morale
of
the
german
soldiers
was
lowest
and
when
the
strain
on
the
high
command
was
greatest
the
weather
turned
in
their
favor
and
gave
them
just
the
they
desperately
needed
rain
fell
heavily
in
the
middle
of
october
autumn
mists
prevented
airplane
activity
and
and
the
ground
became
a
quagmire
so
that
the
british
troops
found
it
difficult
to
get
up
their
supplies
for
a
new
advance
the
germans
were
able
in
this
respite
to
bring
up
new
divisions
fresh
and
strong
enough
to
make
heavy
counter
attacks
in
the
stuff
and
schwaben
and
regina
trenches
and
to
hold
the
lines
more
securely
for
a
time
while
great
digging
was
done
farther
back
at
bapaume
and
the
next
line
of
defense
successive
weeks
of
bad
weather
and
our
own
tragic
losses
checked
the
impetus
of
the
british
and
french
driving
power
and
the
germans
were
able
to
reorganize
and
reform
as
i
have
said
the
shock
of
our
offensive
reached
as
far
as
germany
and
caused
a
complete
reorganization
in
the
system
of
obtaining
reserves
of
the
process
of
combing
out
as
we
call
it
was
pursued
with
astounding
ruthlessness
and
german
mothers
already
stricken
with
the
loss
of
their
elder
sons
raised
cries
of
despair
when
the
youngest
born
were
also
seized
boys
of
eighteen
belonging
to
the
class
the
whole
of
the
class
had
joined
the
depots
in
march
and
may
of
this
year
receiving
a
three
months
training
before
being
transferred
to
the
depots
in
june
and
july
about
the
middle
of
july
the
first
large
drafts
joined
their
units
and
made
their
appearance
at
the
front
and
soon
after
the
beginning
of
our
offensive
at
least
half
this
class
was
in
the
regiments
the
massacre
of
the
boys
had
begun
then
older
men
men
beyond
middle
age
who
correspond
to
the
french
territorial
class
exempted
from
fighting
service
and
kept
on
lines
of
communication
were
also
called
to
the
front
and
whole
garrisons
of
these
gray
heads
were
removed
from
german
towns
to
fill
up
the
ranks
the
view
is
held
here
wrote
a
german
soldier
of
the
somme
that
the
higher
command
intends
gradually
to
have
more
and
more
landsturm
battalions
men
of
the
oldest
reserves
trained
in
trench
warfare
for
a
few
weeks
as
we
have
been
according
to
the
quality
of
the
men
and
thus
to
secure
by
degrees
a
body
of
troops
on
which
it
can
count
in
an
in
the
month
of
november
the
german
high
command
believed
that
the
british
attacks
were
definitely
at
an
end
having
broken
down
as
they
claimed
in
mud
and
blood
but
another
shock
came
to
them
when
once
more
british
troops
the
highland
division
and
the
naval
division
left
their
trenches
in
fog
and
snow
and
captured
the
strongest
fortress
position
on
the
enemy
front
at
beaumont
hamel
bringing
back
over
six
thousand
prisoners
it
was
after
that
they
began
their
retreat
these
studies
of
mine
of
what
happened
on
both
sides
of
the
shifting
lines
in
the
somme
must
be
as
horrible
to
read
as
they
were
to
write
but
they
are
less
than
the
actual
truth
for
no
pen
will
ever
in
one
book
or
in
hundreds
give
the
full
record
of
the
individual
agony
the
broken
the
as
well
as
the
of
that
frightful
struggle
in
which
on
one
side
and
the
other
two
million
men
were
engulfed
modern
civilization
was
wrecked
on
those
fields
though
they
led
to
what
we
called
more
died
there
than
the
flower
of
our
youth
and
german
manhood
the
old
order
of
the
world
died
there
because
many
men
who
came
alive
out
of
that
conflict
were
changed
and
vowed
not
to
tolerate
a
system
of
thought
which
had
led
up
to
such
a
monstrous
massacre
of
human
beings
who
prayed
to
the
same
god
loved
the
same
joys
of
life
and
had
no
hatred
of
one
another
except
as
it
had
been
lighted
and
inflamed
by
their
governors
their
philosophers
and
their
newspapers
the
german
soldier
cursed
the
militarism
which
had
plunged
him
into
that
horror
the
british
soldier
cursed
the
german
as
the
direct
cause
of
all
his
trouble
but
looked
back
on
his
side
of
the
lines
and
saw
an
evil
there
which
was
also
his
enemy
the
evil
of
a
secret
diplomacy
which
juggled
with
the
lives
of
humble
men
so
that
war
might
be
sprung
upon
them
without
their
knowledge
or
consent
and
the
evil
of
rulers
who
hated
german
militarism
not
because
of
its
wickedness
but
because
of
its
strength
in
rivalry
and
the
evil
of
a
folly
in
the
minds
of
men
which
had
taught
them
to
regard
war
as
a
glorious
adventure
and
patriotism
as
the
right
to
dominate
other
peoples
and
liberty
as
a
catch
word
of
politicians
in
search
of
power
after
the
somme
battles
there
were
many
other
battles
as
bloody
and
terrible
but
they
only
confirmed
greater
numbers
of
men
in
the
faith
that
the
old
world
had
been
wrong
in
its
and
wrong
in
its
religion
of
life
lip
service
to
christian
ethics
was
not
good
enough
as
an
argument
for
this
either
the
heart
of
the
world
must
be
changed
by
a
real
obedience
to
the
gospel
of
christ
or
christianity
must
be
abandoned
for
a
new
creed
which
would
give
better
results
between
men
and
nations
there
could
be
no
reconciling
of
and
high
explosives
with
the
words
love
one
or
if
and
force
were
to
be
the
rule
of
life
in
preparation
for
another
struggle
such
as
this
then
at
least
let
men
put
hypocrisy
away
and
return
to
the
primitive
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
a
jungle
world
subservient
to
the
king
of
beasts
the
devotion
of
military
chaplains
to
the
wounded
their
valor
their
decorations
for
gallantry
under
fire
their
human
comradeship
and
spiritual
sincerity
would
not
bridge
the
gulf
in
the
minds
of
many
soldiers
between
a
gospel
of
love
and
this
argument
by
bayonet
and
bomb
and
high
velocity
blunderbuss
club
and
some
time
or
other
when
german
militarism
acknowledged
defeat
by
the
break
of
its
machine
or
by
the
revolt
of
its
people
not
until
then
there
must
be
a
new
order
of
things
which
would
prevent
such
another
massacre
in
the
fair
fields
of
life
and
that
could
come
only
by
a
faith
in
the
hearts
of
many
peoples
breaking
down
old
barriers
of
hatred
and
reaching
out
to
one
another
in
a
fellowship
of
common
sense
based
on
common
interests
and
inspired
by
an
ideal
higher
than
this
rivalry
of
nations
so
thinking
men
thought
and
talked
so
said
the
soldier
poets
who
wrote
from
the
trenches
so
said
many
onlookers
the
simple
soldier
did
not
talk
like
that
unless
he
were
a
frenchman
our
men
only
began
to
talk
like
that
after
the
war
as
many
of
them
are
now
talking
and
the
revolt
of
the
spirit
vague
but
passionate
against
the
evil
that
had
produced
this
devil
trap
of
war
and
the
german
challenge
was
subconscious
as
they
sat
in
their
dugouts
and
crowded
in
their
ditches
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
part
seven
the
fields
of
armageddon
i
during
the
two
years
that
followed
the
battles
of
the
somme
i
recorded
in
my
daily
despatches
republished
in
book
form
the
struggle
in
flanders
and
the
way
to
victory
the
narrative
of
that
continuous
conflict
in
which
the
british
forces
on
the
western
front
were
at
with
the
german
monster
where
now
one
side
and
then
the
other
heaved
themselves
upon
their
adversary
and
struggled
for
the
blow
until
at
last
after
staggering
losses
on
both
sides
the
enemy
was
broken
to
bits
in
the
last
combined
attack
by
british
belgian
french
and
american
armies
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
retell
all
that
history
in
detail
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
there
is
nothing
i
need
alter
in
the
record
of
events
which
i
wrote
as
they
happened
because
they
have
not
been
falsified
by
any
new
evidence
and
those
detailed
descriptions
of
mine
stand
true
in
fact
and
in
the
emotion
of
the
hours
that
passed
while
masses
of
men
were
slaughtered
in
the
fields
of
armageddon
but
now
looking
back
upon
those
last
two
years
of
the
war
as
an
of
many
tragic
and
heroic
things
i
see
the
frightful
drama
of
them
as
a
whole
and
as
one
act
was
related
to
another
and
as
the
plot
which
seemed
so
tangled
and
confused
led
by
inevitable
stages
not
under
the
control
of
any
or
chief
of
staff
to
the
climax
in
which
empires
crashed
and
exhausted
nations
looked
round
upon
the
ruin
which
followed
defeat
and
victory
i
see
also
as
in
one
picture
the
colossal
scale
of
that
human
struggle
in
that
armageddon
of
our
civilization
which
at
the
time
one
reckoned
only
by
each
day
success
or
failure
each
day
slaughter
on
that
side
or
the
other
one
may
add
up
the
whole
sum
according
to
the
bookkeeping
of
fate
by
credit
and
debit
profit
and
loss
one
may
set
our
attacks
in
the
battles
of
flanders
against
the
strength
of
the
german
defense
and
say
our
losses
of
three
to
one
as
ludendorff
reckons
them
and
as
many
of
us
guessed
were
in
our
favor
because
we
could
afford
the
difference
of
exchange
and
the
enemy
could
not
put
so
many
human
counters
into
the
pool
for
the
final
kitty
in
this
gamble
with
life
and
death
one
may
balance
the
german
offensive
in
march
of
with
the
weight
that
was
piling
up
against
them
by
the
entry
of
the
americans
one
may
also
see
now
very
clearly
the
paramount
importance
of
the
human
factor
in
this
arithmetic
of
war
the
morale
of
men
being
of
greater
influence
than
generalship
though
dependent
on
it
the
spirit
of
peoples
being
as
vital
to
success
as
the
mechanical
efficiency
of
the
and
above
all
one
is
now
able
to
observe
how
each
side
blundered
on
in
a
blind
desperate
way
sacrificing
masses
of
human
life
without
a
clear
vision
of
the
consequences
until
at
last
one
side
blundered
more
than
another
and
was
lost
it
will
be
impossible
to
pretend
in
history
that
our
high
command
or
any
other
foresaw
the
thread
of
plot
as
it
was
unraveled
to
the
end
and
so
arranged
its
plan
that
events
happened
according
to
design
the
events
of
march
were
not
foreseen
nor
prevented
by
french
or
british
the
ability
of
our
generals
was
not
imaginative
nor
inventive
but
limited
to
the
piling
up
of
men
and
munitions
always
more
men
and
more
munitions
against
positions
of
enormous
strength
and
overcoming
obstacles
by
sheer
weight
of
flesh
and
blood
and
high
explosives
they
were
not
cunning
so
far
as
i
could
see
nor
in
the
judgment
of
the
men
under
their
command
but
simple
and
straightforward
gentlemen
who
said
once
more
unto
the
breach
and
sent
up
new
by
brigades
and
divisions
there
was
no
evidence
that
i
could
find
of
high
directing
brains
choosing
the
weakest
spot
in
the
enemy
armor
and
piercing
it
with
a
sharp
sword
or
avoiding
a
direct
assault
against
the
enemy
most
formidable
positions
and
leaping
upon
him
from
some
unguarded
way
perhaps
that
was
impossible
in
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
and
the
limitations
of
the
british
front
until
the
arrival
of
the
tanks
which
for
a
long
time
were
wasted
in
the
impassable
bogs
of
flanders
where
their
steel
skeletons
still
lie
rusting
as
a
proof
of
heroic
efforts
vainly
used
possible
or
not
and
rare
genius
alone
could
prove
it
one
way
or
another
it
appeared
to
the
onlooker
as
well
as
to
the
soldier
who
carried
out
commands
that
our
method
of
warfare
was
to
search
the
map
for
a
place
which
was
strongest
in
the
enemy
lines
most
difficult
to
attack
most
powerfully
defended
and
then
after
due
advertisement
not
to
take
an
unfair
advantage
of
the
enemy
to
launch
the
assault
that
had
always
been
the
english
way
and
that
was
our
way
in
many
battles
of
the
great
war
which
were
won
unless
they
were
lost
by
the
sheer
valor
of
men
who
at
great
cost
smashed
their
way
through
all
obstructions
the
germans
on
the
whole
showed
more
original
genius
in
military
science
varying
their
methods
of
attack
and
defense
according
to
circumstances
building
trenches
and
dugouts
which
we
never
equaled
inventing
the
concrete
blockhouse
or
for
a
forward
defensive
zone
thinly
held
in
advance
of
the
main
battle
zone
in
order
to
lessen
their
slaughter
under
the
weight
of
our
it
cost
us
dearly
for
a
time
scattering
their
men
in
organized
in
order
to
distract
our
barrage
fire
using
the
elastic
system
of
defense
with
frightful
success
against
nivelle
attack
in
the
champagne
creating
the
system
of
assault
of
infiltration
which
broke
the
italian
lines
at
caporetto
in
and
ours
and
the
french
in
against
all
that
we
may
set
only
our
tanks
which
in
the
end
led
the
way
to
victory
but
the
german
high
command
blundered
atrociously
in
all
the
larger
calculations
of
war
so
that
they
brought
about
the
doom
of
their
empire
by
a
series
of
acts
which
would
seem
deliberate
if
we
had
not
known
that
they
were
merely
blind
with
a
folly
that
still
seems
incredible
they
took
the
risk
of
adding
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
in
numbers
of
men
and
in
potential
energy
to
their
list
of
enemies
at
a
time
when
their
own
was
on
the
wane
with
deliberate
arrogance
they
flouted
the
united
states
and
forced
her
to
declare
war
their
temptation
of
course
was
great
the
british
naval
blockade
was
causing
severe
suffering
by
food
shortage
to
the
german
people
and
denying
them
access
to
raw
material
which
they
needed
for
the
machinery
of
war
the
submarine
campaign
ruthlessly
carried
out
would
and
did
inflict
immense
damage
upon
british
and
allied
shipping
and
was
a
deadly
menace
to
england
but
german
calculations
were
utterly
wrong
as
ludendorff
in
his
memoirs
now
admits
in
estimating
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
break
her
bonds
by
submarine
warfare
before
america
could
send
over
great
armies
to
europe
the
german
war
lords
were
wrong
again
in
underestimating
the
defensive
and
offensive
success
of
the
british
navy
and
mercantile
marine
against
submarine
activities
by
those
miscalculations
they
lost
the
war
in
the
long
run
and
by
other
errors
they
made
their
loss
more
certain
one
mistake
they
made
was
their
utter
callousness
regarding
the
psychology
and
temper
of
their
soldiers
and
civilian
population
they
put
a
greater
strain
upon
them
than
human
nature
could
bear
and
by
driving
their
into
one
shambles
after
another
while
they
doped
their
people
with
false
promises
which
were
never
fulfilled
they
sowed
the
seeds
of
revolt
and
despair
which
finally
launched
them
into
gulfs
of
ruin
i
have
read
nothing
more
horrible
than
the
cruelty
of
ludendorff
memoirs
in
which
without
any
attempt
at
he
reveals
himself
as
using
the
lives
of
millions
of
men
upon
a
gambling
chance
of
victory
with
the
hazards
weighted
against
him
as
he
admits
writing
of
january
he
says
a
collapse
on
the
part
of
russia
was
by
no
means
to
be
contemplated
and
was
indeed
not
reckoned
upon
by
any
one
failing
the
campaign
we
reckoned
with
the
collapse
of
the
quadruple
alliance
during
yet
with
that
enormous
risk
visible
ahead
ludendorff
continued
to
play
the
grand
jeu
the
great
game
and
did
not
advise
any
surrender
of
imperial
ambitions
in
order
to
obtain
a
peace
for
his
people
and
was
furious
with
the
majority
party
in
the
reichstag
for
preparing
a
peace
resolution
the
collapse
of
russia
inspired
him
with
new
hopes
of
victory
in
the
west
and
again
he
prepared
to
sacrifice
masses
of
men
in
the
but
he
blundered
again
and
this
time
fatally
his
was
out
of
gear
the
u
boat
war
had
failed
american
manhood
was
pouring
into
france
and
german
soldiers
on
the
russian
front
had
been
infected
with
ideas
most
dangerous
to
german
discipline
and
the
will
to
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
the
german
war
lords
failed
to
understand
the
psychology
of
human
nature
as
they
had
failed
to
understand
the
spirit
of
france
of
belgium
of
great
britain
and
of
america
one
of
the
most
important
admissions
in
history
is
made
by
ludendorff
when
he
writes
looking
back
i
say
our
decline
began
clearly
with
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
in
russia
on
the
one
side
the
government
was
dominated
by
the
fear
that
the
infection
would
spread
and
on
the
other
by
the
feeling
of
their
helplessness
to
instil
fresh
strength
into
the
masses
of
the
people
and
to
strengthen
their
warlike
ardor
waning
as
it
was
through
a
combination
of
innumerable
so
the
web
of
fate
was
spun
and
men
who
thought
they
were
directing
the
destiny
of
the
world
were
merely
caught
in
those
woven
threads
like
puppets
tied
to
strings
and
made
to
dance
it
was
the
old
dance
of
death
which
has
happened
before
in
the
folly
of
mankind
ii
during
the
german
retreat
to
their
hindenburg
line
we
saw
the
full
ruthlessness
of
war
as
never
before
on
the
western
front
in
the
laying
waste
of
a
beautiful
countryside
not
by
rational
fighting
but
by
carefully
organized
destruction
ludendorff
claims
quite
justly
that
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
war
that
is
true
it
is
only
that
our
laws
of
war
are
not
justified
by
any
code
of
humanity
above
that
of
primitive
savages
the
decision
to
retreat
he
says
was
not
reached
without
a
painful
struggle
it
implied
a
confession
of
weakness
that
was
bound
to
raise
the
morale
of
the
enemy
and
to
lower
our
own
but
as
it
was
necessary
for
military
reasons
we
had
no
choice
it
had
to
be
carried
out
the
whole
movement
was
a
brilliant
performance
the
retirement
proved
in
a
high
degree
i
saw
the
brilliant
performance
in
its
operation
i
went
into
beautiful
little
towns
like
peronne
where
the
houses
were
being
gutted
by
smoldering
fire
and
into
hundreds
of
villages
where
the
enemy
had
just
gone
out
of
them
after
touching
off
explosive
charges
which
had
made
all
their
cottages
collapse
like
card
houses
their
roofs
spread
flat
upon
their
ruins
and
their
churches
after
centuries
of
worship
in
them
fall
into
chaotic
heaps
of
masonry
i
wandered
through
the
ruins
of
old
french
chateaux
once
very
stately
in
their
terraced
gardens
now
a
litter
of
brickwork
broken
statuary
and
twisted
iron
work
above
open
vaults
where
not
even
the
dead
had
been
left
to
lie
in
peace
i
saw
the
little
old
of
french
peasants
sawn
off
at
the
base
and
the
tall
trees
along
the
roadsides
stretched
out
like
dead
giants
to
bar
our
passage
enormous
craters
had
been
blown
in
the
roadways
which
had
to
be
bridged
for
our
traffic
of
men
and
guns
following
hard
upon
the
enemy
retreat
there
was
a
queer
sense
of
illusion
as
one
traveled
through
this
desolation
at
a
short
distance
many
of
the
villages
seemed
to
stand
as
before
the
war
one
expected
to
find
inhabitants
there
but
upon
close
approach
one
saw
that
each
house
was
but
an
empty
shell
blown
out
from
cellar
to
roof
and
one
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
ruins
in
a
silence
that
was
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
one
own
voice
or
by
a
few
shells
crashing
into
the
gutted
houses
the
enemy
was
in
the
next
village
or
the
next
but
one
with
a
few
and
a
of
in
most
villages
in
many
of
his
dugouts
and
by
contraptions
with
objects
lying
amid
the
litter
he
had
left
booby
traps
to
blow
our
men
to
bits
if
they
knocked
a
wire
or
stirred
an
old
boot
or
picked
up
a
or
walked
too
often
over
a
board
where
beneath
acid
was
eating
through
a
metal
plate
to
a
charge
i
little
knew
when
i
walked
round
the
tower
of
the
town
hall
of
bapaume
that
in
another
week
with
the
enemy
far
away
it
would
go
up
in
dust
and
ashes
only
a
few
of
our
men
were
killed
or
blinded
by
these
our
engineers
found
most
of
them
before
they
were
touched
off
but
one
went
down
dugouts
or
into
ruined
houses
with
a
sense
of
imminent
danger
all
through
the
devastated
region
one
walked
with
an
uncanny
feeling
of
an
evil
spirit
left
behind
by
masses
of
men
whose
bodies
had
gone
away
it
exuded
from
scraps
of
old
clothing
it
was
in
the
stench
of
the
dugouts
and
in
the
ruins
they
had
made
in
some
few
villages
there
were
living
people
left
behind
some
hundreds
in
nesle
and
roye
and
all
told
some
thousands
they
had
been
driven
in
from
the
other
villages
burning
around
them
their
own
villages
whose
devastation
they
wept
to
see
i
met
these
people
who
had
lived
under
german
rule
and
talked
with
many
of
them
old
women
wrinkled
like
apples
young
women
waxen
of
skin
with
sharp
cheekbones
old
peasant
farmers
and
the
gamekeepers
of
french
chateaux
and
young
boys
and
girls
pinched
by
years
of
hunger
that
was
not
quite
starvation
it
was
from
these
people
that
i
learned
a
good
deal
about
the
psychology
of
german
soldiers
during
the
battles
of
the
somme
they
told
me
of
the
terror
of
these
men
at
the
increasing
fury
of
our
of
their
desertion
and
revolt
to
escape
the
slaughter
and
of
their
rage
against
the
great
people
who
used
them
for
habitually
many
of
them
talked
of
the
war
as
the
great
these
french
civilians
hated
the
germans
in
the
mass
with
a
cold
deadly
hatred
they
spoke
with
shrill
passion
at
the
thought
of
german
discipline
fines
punishments
requisitions
which
they
had
suffered
in
these
years
the
hope
of
vengeance
was
like
water
to
parched
throats
yet
i
noticed
that
nearly
every
one
of
these
people
had
something
good
to
say
about
some
german
soldier
who
had
been
billeted
with
them
he
was
a
fellow
he
chopped
wood
for
me
and
gave
the
children
his
own
bread
he
wept
when
he
told
me
that
the
village
was
to
be
even
some
of
the
german
officers
had
deplored
this
destruction
the
world
will
have
a
right
to
call
us
barbarians
said
one
of
them
in
ham
but
what
can
we
do
we
are
under
orders
if
we
do
not
obey
we
shall
be
shot
it
is
the
cruelty
of
the
high
command
it
is
the
cruelty
of
on
the
whole
it
seemed
they
had
not
misused
the
women
i
heard
no
tales
of
actual
atrocity
though
some
of
brutal
passion
but
many
women
shrugged
their
shoulders
when
i
questioned
them
about
this
and
said
they
had
no
need
to
use
violence
in
their
way
of
love
making
there
were
many
they
rubbed
their
thumbs
and
fingers
together
as
though
touching
money
and
said
you
understand
i
understood
when
i
went
to
a
convent
in
amiens
and
saw
a
crowd
of
young
mothers
with
babies
just
arrived
from
the
liberated
districts
all
those
are
the
children
of
german
fathers
said
the
old
reverend
mother
that
is
the
worst
tragedy
of
war
how
will
god
punish
all
this
alas
it
is
the
innocent
who
suffer
for
the
eighteen
months
later
or
thereabouts
i
went
into
a
house
in
cologne
where
a
british
outpost
was
on
the
hohenzollern
bridge
there
was
a
babies
creche
in
an
upper
room
and
a
german
lady
was
tending
thirty
little
ones
whose
chorus
of
guten
tag
guten
tag
was
like
the
quacking
of
ducks
after
there
will
be
no
more
milk
for
them
she
said
and
then
i
asked
and
then
many
of
them
will
she
wept
a
little
i
thought
of
those
other
babies
in
amiens
and
of
the
old
reverend
mother
how
will
god
punish
all
this
alas
it
is
the
innocent
who
suffer
for
the
of
those
things
general
ludendorff
does
not
write
in
his
memoirs
which
deal
with
the
strategy
and
machinery
of
war
iii
sir
douglas
haig
was
not
misled
into
the
error
of
following
up
the
german
retreat
across
that
devastated
country
with
masses
of
men
he
sent
forward
outposts
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
german
and
prepared
to
deliver
big
blows
at
the
vimy
ridge
and
the
lines
round
arras
this
new
battle
by
british
troops
was
dictated
by
french
strategy
rather
than
by
ours
general
nivelle
the
new
generalissimo
was
organizing
a
great
offensive
in
the
champagne
and
desired
the
british
army
to
strike
first
and
keep
on
striking
in
order
to
engage
and
exhaust
german
divisions
until
he
was
ready
to
launch
his
own
legions
the
secret
of
his
preparations
was
known
by
every
officer
in
the
french
army
and
by
hindenburg
and
his
staff
who
prepared
a
new
method
of
defense
to
meet
it
the
french
officers
with
whom
i
talked
were
supremely
confident
of
success
we
shall
go
through
they
said
it
is
certain
anybody
who
thinks
otherwise
is
a
traitor
who
betrays
his
country
by
the
poison
of
pessimism
nivelle
will
deal
the
death
so
spoke
an
officer
of
the
chasseurs
alpins
and
a
friend
in
the
infantry
of
the
line
over
a
cup
of
coffee
in
an
estaminet
crammed
with
other
french
soldiers
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
champagne
front
nivelle
did
not
launch
his
offensive
until
april
seven
days
after
the
british
had
captured
the
heights
of
vimy
and
gone
far
to
the
east
of
arras
hindenburg
was
ready
he
adopted
his
elastic
system
of
defense
which
consisted
in
withdrawing
the
main
body
of
his
troops
beyond
the
range
of
the
french
barrage
fire
leaving
only
a
few
outposts
to
camouflage
the
withdrawal
and
be
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
the
others
those
german
outposts
must
have
disliked
their
martyrdom
under
orders
and
i
doubt
whether
they
poor
devils
were
exhilarated
by
the
thought
of
their
heroic
service
he
also
withdrew
the
full
power
of
his
artillery
beyond
the
range
of
french
work
and
to
such
a
distance
that
when
it
was
the
german
turn
to
fire
the
french
infantry
would
be
beyond
the
effective
protection
of
their
own
guns
they
were
to
be
allowed
an
easy
walk
through
to
their
that
is
what
happened
the
french
infantry
advancing
with
masses
of
black
troops
in
the
colonial
corps
in
the
of
assault
all
exultant
and
inspired
by
a
belief
in
victory
swept
through
the
forward
zone
of
the
german
defenses
astonished
and
then
disconcerted
by
the
scarcity
of
germans
until
an
annihilating
barrage
fire
dropped
upon
them
and
smashed
their
human
waves
from
french
officers
and
nurses
i
heard
appalling
tales
of
this
tragedy
the
death
wail
of
the
black
troops
froze
the
blood
of
frenchmen
with
horror
their
own
losses
were
immense
in
a
bloody
shambles
i
was
told
by
french
officers
that
their
losses
on
the
first
day
of
battle
were
casualties
and
these
figures
were
generally
believed
they
were
not
so
bad
as
that
though
terrible
figures
state
that
the
operations
which
lasted
from
april
to
april
cost
france
killed
on
the
field
of
battle
who
died
of
wounds
in
hospital
prisoners
and
wounded
general
nivelle
offensive
was
called
off
and
french
officers
who
had
said
we
shall
break
through
it
is
certain
now
said
we
came
up
against
a
bec
de
gaz
as
you
english
would
say
we
it
in
the
neck
it
is
a
great
the
battle
of
arras
in
which
the
british
army
was
engaged
began
on
april
an
easter
sunday
when
there
was
a
gale
of
sleet
and
snow
from
ground
near
the
old
city
of
arras
i
saw
the
preliminary
bombardment
when
the
vimy
ridge
was
blasted
by
a
hurricane
of
fire
and
the
german
lines
beyond
arras
were
tossed
up
in
earth
and
flame
from
one
of
old
vauban
earthworks
outside
the
walls
i
saw
lines
of
our
men
going
up
in
assault
beyond
the
suburbs
of
blangy
and
to
roclincourt
through
a
veil
of
sleet
and
smoke
our
was
immense
and
devastating
and
the
first
blow
that
fell
upon
the
enemy
was
overpowering
the
vimy
ridge
was
captured
from
end
to
end
by
the
canadians
on
the
left
and
the
division
of
highlanders
on
the
right
by
the
afternoon
the
entire
living
german
population
more
than
seven
thousand
in
the
tunnels
of
vimy
were
down
below
in
the
valley
on
our
side
of
the
lines
and
on
the
ridge
were
many
of
their
dead
as
i
saw
them
afterward
horribly
mangled
by
in
the
upheaved
earth
the
highland
division
commanded
by
general
harper
uncle
harper
he
was
called
had
done
as
well
as
the
canadians
though
they
had
less
honor
and
took
as
many
prisoners
was
their
divisional
sign
as
i
saw
it
stenciled
on
many
ruined
walls
throughout
the
war
well
general
said
a
scottish
sergeant
they
do
call
us
harper
duds
any
more
on
the
right
english
county
troops
of
the
division
division
and
others
the
scottish
and
the
london
had
broken
through
deeply
and
widely
capturing
many
men
and
guns
after
hard
fighting
round
redoubts
that
night
masses
of
german
prisoners
suffered
terribly
from
a
blizzard
in
the
cages
at
etrun
by
arras
where
julius
caesar
had
his
camp
for
a
year
in
other
days
of
history
they
herded
together
with
their
bodies
bent
to
the
storm
each
man
sheltering
his
fellow
and
giving
a
little
human
warmth
all
night
through
a
german
commandant
sat
in
our
intelligence
hut
with
his
head
bowed
on
his
breast
every
now
and
then
he
said
it
is
cold
it
is
cold
and
our
men
lay
out
in
the
captured
ground
beyond
arras
and
on
the
vimy
ridge
under
harassing
fire
and
fire
cold
too
in
that
wild
blizzard
with
british
dead
and
german
dead
in
the
mangled
earth
about
them
ludendorff
admits
the
severity
of
that
defeat
the
battle
near
arras
on
april
formed
a
bad
beginning
to
the
capital
fighting
during
this
year
april
and
the
succeeding
days
were
critical
days
a
breach
twelve
thousand
to
fifteen
thousand
yards
wide
and
as
much
as
six
thousand
yards
and
more
in
depth
is
not
a
thing
to
be
mended
without
more
ado
it
takes
a
good
deal
to
repair
the
inordinate
wastage
of
men
and
guns
as
well
as
munitions
that
results
from
such
a
breach
it
was
the
business
of
the
supreme
command
to
provide
reserves
on
a
large
scale
but
in
view
of
the
troops
available
and
of
the
war
situation
it
was
simply
not
possible
to
hold
a
second
division
in
readiness
behind
each
division
that
might
perhaps
be
about
to
drop
out
a
day
like
april
upset
all
calculations
it
was
a
matter
of
days
before
a
new
front
could
be
formed
and
consolidated
even
after
the
troops
were
ultimately
in
line
the
issue
of
the
crisis
depended
as
always
in
such
cases
very
materially
upon
whether
the
enemy
followed
up
his
initial
success
with
a
fresh
attack
and
by
fresh
successes
made
it
difficult
for
us
to
create
a
firm
front
in
view
of
the
weakening
of
the
line
that
inevitably
resulted
such
successes
were
only
too
easy
to
achieve
from
april
onward
the
english
attacked
in
the
breach
in
great
strength
but
after
all
not
in
the
grand
manner
they
extended
their
attack
on
both
wings
especially
to
the
southward
as
far
as
bullecourt
on
april
they
gained
monchy
while
we
during
the
night
before
the
evacuated
the
vimy
heights
april
and
and
also
may
were
again
days
of
heavy
pitched
battle
in
between
there
was
some
bitter
local
fighting
the
struggle
continued
we
delivered
minor
successful
and
on
the
other
hand
lost
ground
slightly
at
various
i
remember
many
pictures
of
that
fighting
round
arras
in
the
days
that
followed
the
first
day
i
remember
the
sinister
beauty
of
the
city
itself
when
there
was
a
surging
traffic
of
men
and
guns
through
its
ruined
streets
in
spite
of
shells
which
came
crashing
into
the
houses
our
soldiers
in
their
steel
hats
and
goatskin
coats
looked
like
medieval
the
highlanders
who
crowded
arras
had
their
there
and
they
played
in
the
petite
place
and
the
skirl
of
the
pipes
shattered
against
the
gables
of
old
houses
there
were
tunnels
beneath
arras
through
which
our
men
advanced
to
the
german
lines
and
i
went
along
them
when
one
line
of
men
was
going
into
battle
and
another
was
coming
back
wounded
some
of
them
blind
bloody
vomiting
with
the
fumes
of
gas
in
their
lungs
their
steel
hats
clinking
as
they
groped
past
one
another
in
vaults
each
side
of
these
passages
men
played
cards
on
barrels
to
the
light
of
candles
stuck
in
bottles
or
slept
until
their
turn
to
fight
with
for
their
pillows
outside
the
citadel
of
arras
built
by
vauban
under
louis
xiv
there
were
long
queues
of
wounded
men
taking
their
turn
to
the
surgeons
who
were
working
in
a
deep
crypt
with
a
roof
one
day
there
were
three
thousand
of
them
silent
patient
muddy
blind
boys
or
men
with
smashed
faces
swathed
in
bloody
rags
groped
forward
to
the
dark
passage
leading
to
the
vault
led
by
comrades
on
the
grass
outside
lay
men
with
leg
wounds
and
stomach
wounds
the
way
past
the
station
to
the
road
was
a
for
our
transport
and
i
saw
the
bodies
of
horses
and
men
horribly
mangled
there
dead
horses
were
thick
on
each
side
of
an
avenue
of
trees
on
the
southern
side
of
the
city
lying
in
their
blood
and
bowels
the
traffic
policeman
on
point
duty
on
the
road
had
an
impassive
face
under
his
steel
helmet
as
though
in
piccadilly
circus
only
turned
his
head
a
little
at
the
scream
of
a
shell
which
plunged
through
the
gable
of
a
corner
house
above
him
there
was
a
pioneer
battalion
along
the
road
out
to
observatory
ridge
which
was
a
german
target
they
were
mending
the
road
beyond
the
last
trench
through
which
our
men
had
smashed
their
way
they
were
busy
with
bricks
and
shovels
only
stopping
to
stare
at
shells
plowing
holes
in
the
fields
on
each
side
of
them
when
i
came
back
one
morning
a
number
of
them
lay
covered
with
blankets
as
though
asleep
they
were
dead
but
their
comrades
worked
on
grimly
with
no
joy
of
labor
in
their
sweat
monchy
hill
was
the
key
position
high
above
the
valley
of
the
scarpe
i
saw
it
first
when
there
was
a
white
village
there
hardly
touched
by
fire
and
afterward
when
there
was
no
village
i
was
in
the
village
below
observatory
ridge
on
the
morning
of
april
when
cavalry
was
massed
on
that
ground
waiting
for
orders
to
go
into
action
the
headquarters
of
the
cavalry
division
was
in
a
ditch
covered
by
planks
and
the
cavalry
generals
and
their
staffs
sat
huddled
together
with
maps
over
their
knees
i
am
afraid
the
general
is
busy
for
the
moment
said
a
young
on
top
of
the
ditch
he
looked
about
the
fields
and
said
it
very
unhealthy
i
agreed
with
him
the
bodies
of
many
young
soldiers
lay
about
were
coming
over
in
a
haphazard
way
it
was
no
ground
for
cavalry
but
some
squadrons
of
the
hussars
essex
yeomanry
and
the
blues
were
ordered
to
take
monchy
and
rode
up
the
hill
in
a
flurry
of
snow
and
were
seen
by
german
gunners
and
slashed
by
shrapnel
most
of
their
horses
were
killed
in
the
village
or
outside
it
and
the
men
suffered
many
casualties
including
their
general
bulkely
johnson
whose
body
i
saw
carried
back
on
a
stretcher
to
the
ruin
of
thilloy
where
crumps
were
bursting
it
is
an
astonishing
thing
that
two
withered
old
french
women
stayed
in
the
village
all
through
the
fighting
when
our
troops
rode
in
these
women
came
running
forward
frightened
and
crying
camarades
as
though
in
fear
of
the
enemy
when
our
men
surrounded
them
they
were
full
of
joy
and
held
up
their
scraggy
old
faces
to
be
kissed
by
these
troopers
afterward
monchy
was
filled
with
a
fury
of
and
the
troopers
crawled
out
from
the
ruins
leaving
the
village
on
the
hill
to
be
attacked
and
captured
again
by
our
infantry
of
the
and
divisions
who
were
also
badly
hammered
heroic
folly
the
cavalry
in
reserve
below
observatory
hill
stood
to
their
horses
staring
up
at
a
german
airplane
which
came
overhead
careless
of
our
the
eye
of
the
german
pilot
must
have
widened
at
the
sight
of
that
mass
of
men
and
horses
he
carried
back
glad
tidings
to
the
guns
one
of
the
cavalry
officers
spoke
to
me
you
look
no
i
all
right
only
the
officer
himself
looked
worn
and
haggard
after
a
night
in
the
open
do
you
think
the
germans
will
get
their
range
as
far
as
this
nervous
about
the
men
and
the
horses
we
been
here
for
hours
and
it
seems
no
i
did
not
remind
him
that
the
airplane
was
undoubtedly
the
herald
of
shells
they
came
within
a
few
minutes
some
men
and
horses
were
killed
i
was
with
a
highland
officer
and
we
took
cover
in
a
ditch
not
more
than
breast
high
shells
were
bursting
damnably
close
scattering
us
with
dirt
let
strike
away
from
the
road
said
major
schiach
they
always
tape
it
we
struck
across
country
back
to
arras
glad
to
get
there
other
men
had
to
stay
the
battles
to
the
east
of
arras
that
went
before
the
capture
of
monchy
and
followed
it
were
hard
nagging
actions
along
the
valley
of
the
scarpe
which
formed
a
glacis
where
our
men
were
terribly
exposed
to
machine
gun
fire
and
suffered
heavily
day
after
day
week
after
week
for
no
object
apparent
to
our
battalion
officers
and
men
who
did
not
know
that
they
were
doing
for
the
french
the
londoners
of
the
division
made
a
record
advance
through
to
henin
and
heninel
and
broke
a
of
the
hindenburg
system
across
the
little
cojeul
river
by
wancourt
there
was
a
fatal
attack
in
the
dark
on
may
when
east
kents
and
surreys
and
londoners
saw
a
gray
dawn
come
revealing
the
enemy
between
them
and
our
main
line
and
had
to
hack
their
way
through
if
they
could
there
were
many
who
could
not
and
even
divisional
generals
were
embittered
by
these
needless
losses
and
by
the
hard
driving
of
their
men
saying
fierce
things
about
our
high
command
their
language
was
mild
compared
with
that
of
some
of
our
young
officers
i
remember
one
i
met
near
henin
he
was
one
of
a
group
of
three
all
gunner
officers
who
were
looking
about
for
better
gun
positions
not
so
clearly
visible
to
the
enemy
who
was
in
two
little
woods
the
bois
de
sart
and
bois
vert
which
stared
down
upon
them
like
green
eyes
some
of
their
guns
had
been
destroyed
many
of
their
horses
killed
some
of
their
men
a
few
minutes
before
our
meeting
a
shell
had
crashed
into
a
bath
close
to
their
hut
where
men
were
washing
themselves
the
explosion
filled
the
bath
with
blood
and
bits
of
flesh
the
younger
officer
stared
at
me
under
the
tilt
forward
of
his
steel
hat
and
said
hullo
gibbs
i
had
played
chess
with
him
at
groom
cafe
in
fleet
street
in
days
before
the
war
i
went
back
to
his
hut
and
had
tea
with
him
close
to
that
bath
hoping
that
we
should
not
be
cut
up
with
the
cake
there
were
noises
off
as
they
say
in
stage
directions
which
were
enormously
disconcerting
to
one
peace
of
mind
and
not
very
far
off
i
had
heard
before
some
hard
words
about
our
generalship
and
but
never
anything
so
passionate
so
violent
as
from
that
gunner
officer
his
view
of
the
business
was
summed
up
in
the
word
he
raged
against
the
impossible
orders
sent
down
from
headquarters
against
the
brutality
with
which
men
were
left
in
the
line
week
after
week
and
against
the
monstrous
abominable
futility
of
all
our
strategy
his
nerves
were
in
rags
as
i
could
see
by
the
way
in
which
his
hand
shook
when
he
lighted
one
cigarette
after
another
his
spirit
was
in
a
flame
of
revolt
against
the
misery
of
his
sleeplessness
filth
and
imminent
peril
of
death
every
shell
that
burst
near
henin
sent
a
shudder
through
him
i
stayed
an
hour
in
his
hut
and
then
went
away
toward
with
harassing
fire
following
along
the
way
i
looked
back
many
times
to
the
valley
and
to
the
ridges
where
the
enemy
lived
above
it
invisible
but
deadly
the
sun
was
setting
and
there
was
a
tawny
glamour
in
the
sky
and
a
mystical
beauty
over
the
landscape
despite
the
desert
that
war
had
made
there
leaving
only
white
ruins
and
slaughtered
trees
where
once
there
were
good
villages
with
church
spires
rising
out
of
sheltering
woods
the
german
gunners
were
doing
their
evening
hate
crumps
were
bursting
heavily
again
amid
our
gun
positions
heninel
was
not
a
choice
spot
there
were
other
places
of
extreme
unhealthfulness
where
our
men
had
fought
their
way
up
to
the
hindenburg
line
or
as
the
germans
called
it
the
siegfried
line
croisille
and
cherisy
were
targets
of
german
guns
and
i
saw
them
ravaging
among
the
ruins
and
dodged
them
but
our
men
who
lived
close
to
these
places
stayed
there
too
long
to
dodge
them
always
they
were
inhabitants
not
visitors
the
australians
settled
down
in
front
of
bullecourt
captured
it
after
many
desperate
fights
which
left
them
with
a
bitter
grudge
against
tanks
which
had
failed
them
and
some
english
troops
who
were
held
up
on
the
left
while
they
went
forward
and
were
slaughtered
the
australian
division
lost
three
thousand
men
in
an
experimental
attack
directed
by
the
fifth
army
they
made
their
gun
emplacements
in
the
noreuil
valley
the
valley
of
death
as
they
called
it
and
australian
gunners
made
little
slit
trenches
and
scuttled
into
them
when
the
germans
ranged
on
their
batteries
blowing
gun
spokes
and
wheels
and
into
the
air
queant
the
bastion
of
the
hindenburg
line
stared
straight
down
the
valley
and
it
was
evil
ground
as
i
knew
when
i
went
walking
there
with
another
war
correspondent
and
an
australian
officer
who
at
a
great
pace
led
us
round
about
amid
and
debouched
a
little
to
see
one
of
our
exploding
like
a
brock
benefit
and
chattered
brightly
under
woolly
bears
which
made
a
rending
tumult
above
our
heads
i
think
he
enjoyed
his
afternoon
out
from
in
the
headquarters
huts
afterward
i
was
told
that
he
was
mad
but
i
think
he
was
only
brave
i
hated
those
hours
but
put
on
the
mask
that
royalty
wears
when
it
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
streams
of
wounded
poured
down
into
the
casualty
clearing
stations
day
by
day
week
by
week
and
i
saw
the
crowded
butchers
shops
of
war
where
busy
surgeons
lopped
at
limbs
and
plugged
men
wounds
yet
in
those
days
as
before
and
afterward
as
at
the
beginning
and
as
at
the
end
the
spirits
of
british
soldiers
kept
high
unless
their
bodies
were
laid
low
between
battles
they
enjoyed
their
spells
of
rest
behind
the
lines
in
that
early
summer
of
there
was
laughter
in
arras
lots
of
fun
in
spite
of
high
velocities
the
music
of
massed
pipers
and
brass
bands
jolly
comradeship
in
billets
with
paneled
walls
upon
which
perhaps
robespierre
shadow
had
fallen
in
the
before
the
revolution
when
he
was
the
good
young
man
of
arras
as
a
guest
of
the
gordons
of
the
division
i
listened
to
the
pipers
who
marched
round
the
table
and
stood
behind
the
colonel
chair
and
mine
and
played
the
martial
music
of
scotland
until
something
seemed
to
break
in
my
soul
and
my
i
introduced
a
french
friend
to
the
mess
and
as
a
guest
of
honor
he
sat
next
to
the
colonel
and
the
eight
pipers
played
behind
his
chair
he
went
pale
deadly
white
and
presently
swooned
off
his
chair
and
the
gordons
thought
it
the
finest
tribute
to
their
pipes
the
officers
danced
reels
in
stocking
feet
with
challenging
cries
gaelic
exhortations
with
fine
grace
and
passion
though
they
were
tangled
sometimes
in
the
maze
many
of
them
fell
in
the
fields
outside
or
in
the
bogs
of
flanders
on
the
western
side
of
arras
there
were
field
sports
by
london
men
and
surreys
buffs
sussex
norfolks
suffolks
and
devons
they
played
cricket
between
their
turns
in
the
line
lived
in
the
sunshine
of
the
day
and
did
not
look
forward
to
the
morrow
at
such
times
one
found
no
trace
of
war
agony
in
their
faces
or
their
eyes
nor
in
the
quality
of
their
laughter
my
at
that
time
with
other
war
correspondents
was
in
an
old
white
chateau
between
and
hesdin
from
which
we
motored
out
to
the
line
arras
way
or
vimy
way
for
those
walks
in
queer
street
the
contrast
of
our
retreat
with
that
armageddon
beyond
was
profound
and
bewildering
behind
the
old
white
house
were
winding
walks
through
little
woods
beside
the
stream
which
henry
crossed
on
his
way
to
agincourt
tapestried
in
early
spring
with
bluebells
and
daffodils
and
all
the
flowers
that
ronsard
wove
into
his
verse
in
the
springtime
of
france
birds
sang
their
in
the
thickets
the
tits
twittered
fearfully
at
the
laugh
of
the
jay
all
that
beauty
was
like
a
sharp
pain
at
one
heart
after
hearing
the
close
tumult
of
the
guns
and
trudging
over
the
blasted
fields
of
war
in
the
routine
of
our
task
week
by
week
month
by
month
this
makes
for
madness
said
a
friend
of
mine
a
musician
surprised
to
find
himself
a
soldier
in
the
morning
we
see
boys
with
their
heads
blown
off
that
morning
beyond
the
point
du
jour
and
thelus
we
had
passed
a
group
of
headless
boys
and
another
coming
up
stared
at
them
with
a
silly
smile
and
said
they
copped
it
all
right
and
went
on
to
the
same
risk
and
we
had
crouched
below
mounds
of
earth
when
shells
had
scattered
dirt
over
us
and
scared
us
horribly
so
that
we
felt
a
little
sick
in
the
stomach
and
in
the
afternoon
we
walk
through
this
garden
where
the
birds
are
singing
there
is
no
sense
in
it
it
just
midsummer
madness
but
only
one
of
us
went
really
mad
and
tried
to
cut
his
throat
and
died
one
of
the
best
as
i
knew
him
at
his
best
iv
the
battles
of
the
third
army
beyond
arras
petered
out
and
on
june
there
was
the
battle
of
messines
and
wytschaete
when
the
second
army
revealed
its
mastery
of
organization
and
detail
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
vastly
ambitious
scheme
to
capture
the
whole
line
of
ridges
through
flanders
of
which
this
was
the
southern
hook
and
then
to
liberate
the
belgian
coast
as
far
inland
as
bruges
by
a
combined
attack
with
shoregoing
tanks
directed
by
the
fourth
army
this
first
blow
at
the
messines
ridge
was
completely
and
wonderfully
successful
due
to
the
explosion
of
seventeen
enormous
mines
under
the
german
positions
followed
by
an
attack
in
depth
divisions
passing
through
each
other
or
as
it
was
called
to
the
final
objectives
against
an
enemy
demoralized
by
the
earthquake
of
the
explosions
for
two
years
there
had
been
fierce
underground
fighting
at
hill
and
elsewhere
when
our
tunnelers
saw
the
germans
had
listened
to
one
another
workings
racing
to
strike
through
first
to
their
galleries
and
touch
off
their
charges
our
miners
aided
by
the
magnificent
work
of
australian
and
canadian
tunnelers
had
beaten
the
enemy
into
sheer
terror
of
their
method
of
fighting
and
they
had
abandoned
it
believing
that
we
had
also
but
we
did
not
as
they
found
to
their
cost
i
had
seen
the
working
of
the
tunnelers
up
by
hill
and
elsewhere
i
had
gone
into
the
darkness
of
the
tunnels
crouching
low
striking
my
steel
hat
with
sharp
knocks
against
the
low
beams
overhead
coming
into
galleries
where
one
could
stand
upright
and
walk
at
ease
in
electric
light
hearing
the
vibrant
hum
of
great
engines
the
murmur
of
men
voices
in
dark
crypts
seeing
numbers
of
men
sleeping
on
bunks
in
the
gloom
of
caverns
close
beneath
the
german
lines
and
listening
through
a
queer
little
instrument
called
a
microphone
by
which
i
heard
the
scuffle
of
german
feet
in
german
galleries
a
thousand
yards
away
the
dropping
of
a
pick
or
shovel
the
knocking
out
of
german
pipes
against
charcoal
stoves
it
was
by
that
listening
instrument
more
perfect
than
the
enemy
that
we
had
beaten
him
and
by
the
grim
determination
of
those
underground
men
of
ours
whose
skin
was
the
color
of
the
chalk
in
which
they
worked
who
coughed
in
the
dampness
of
the
caves
and
who
packed
high
explosives
at
the
hundreds
of
tons
of
it
for
the
moment
when
a
button
should
be
touched
far
away
and
an
electric
current
would
pass
down
a
wire
and
the
enemy
and
his
works
would
be
blown
into
dust
that
moment
came
at
hill
and
sixteen
other
places
below
the
wytschaete
and
messines
ridge
at
on
the
morning
of
june
after
a
quiet
night
of
war
when
a
few
of
our
batteries
had
fired
in
a
desultory
way
and
the
enemy
had
sent
over
some
flocks
of
and
before
the
dawn
i
heard
the
cocks
crow
on
kemmel
hill
i
saw
the
seventeen
mines
go
up
and
earth
and
flame
gush
out
of
them
as
though
the
fires
of
hell
had
risen
a
terrible
sight
as
the
work
of
men
against
their
fellow
creatures
it
was
the
signal
for
seven
hundred
and
fifty
of
our
heavy
guns
and
two
thousand
of
our
field
guns
to
open
fire
and
behind
a
moving
wall
of
bursting
shells
english
irish
and
new
zealand
soldiers
moved
forward
in
dense
waves
it
was
almost
a
only
here
and
there
groups
of
germans
served
their
to
the
death
most
of
the
living
were
stupefied
amid
their
dead
in
the
upheaved
trenches
slashed
woods
and
deepest
dugouts
i
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
and
stared
into
their
great
gulfs
wondering
how
many
german
bodies
had
been
engulfed
there
the
following
day
i
walked
through
wytschaete
wood
to
the
ruins
of
the
hospice
on
the
ridge
in
some
of
our
cavalry
had
passed
this
way
when
the
hospice
was
a
big
building
with
wings
and
outhouses
and
a
large
community
of
nuns
and
children
through
my
glasses
i
had
often
seen
its
ruins
from
kemmel
hill
and
the
scherpenberg
now
nothing
was
left
but
a
pile
of
broken
bricks
not
very
high
our
losses
were
comparatively
small
though
some
brave
men
had
died
including
major
willie
redmond
whose
death
in
wytschaete
wood
was
heard
with
grief
in
ireland
ludendorff
admits
the
severity
of
the
blow
the
moral
effect
of
the
explosions
was
simply
staggering
the
of
june
cost
us
dear
and
owing
to
the
success
of
the
enemy
attack
the
price
we
paid
was
very
heavy
here
too
it
was
many
days
before
the
front
was
again
secure
the
british
army
did
not
press
its
advantage
apparently
it
only
intended
to
improve
its
position
for
the
launching
of
the
great
flanders
offensive
it
thereupon
resumed
operations
between
the
old
arras
battlefield
and
also
between
la
bassee
and
lens
the
object
of
the
enemy
was
to
wear
us
down
and
distract
our
attention
from
that
was
true
the
canadians
made
heavy
attacks
at
lens
some
of
which
i
saw
from
ground
beyond
notre
dame
de
lorette
and
the
vimy
ridge
and
the
enemy
country
by
grenay
when
those
men
besieged
a
long
chain
of
mining
villages
which
girdled
lens
itself
where
every
house
was
a
fort
above
deep
tunnels
i
saw
them
after
desperate
struggles
covered
in
clay
parched
with
thirst
gassed
wounded
but
indomitable
lens
was
the
troy
of
the
canadian
corps
and
the
english
troops
of
the
first
army
and
it
was
only
owing
to
other
battles
they
were
called
upon
to
fight
in
flanders
that
they
had
to
leave
it
at
last
uncaptured
for
the
enemy
to
escape
all
this
was
subsidiary
to
the
great
offensive
in
flanders
with
its
ambitious
objects
but
when
the
battles
of
flanders
began
the
year
was
getting
past
its
middle
age
and
events
on
other
fronts
had
upset
the
strategical
plan
of
sir
douglas
haig
and
our
high
command
the
failure
and
abandonment
of
the
nivelle
offensive
in
the
champagne
were
disastrous
to
us
it
liberated
many
german
divisions
who
could
be
sent
up
to
relieve
exhausted
divisions
in
flanders
instead
of
attacking
the
enemy
when
he
was
weakening
under
assaults
elsewhere
we
attacked
him
when
all
was
quiet
on
the
french
front
the
collapse
of
russia
was
now
happening
and
our
policy
ought
to
have
been
to
save
men
for
the
tremendous
moment
of
when
we
should
need
all
our
strength
so
it
seems
certain
now
though
it
is
easy
to
prophesy
after
the
event
i
went
along
the
coast
as
far
as
coxyde
and
nieuport
and
saw
secret
preparations
for
the
coast
offensive
we
were
building
enormous
gun
emplacements
at
bains
for
naval
guns
camouflaged
in
sand
dunes
our
men
were
being
trained
for
fighting
in
the
dunes
our
artillery
positions
were
mapped
out
three
shots
to
one
sir
said
sir
henry
rawlinson
to
the
king
the
stuff
to
give
them
but
the
germans
struck
the
first
blow
up
there
not
of
importance
to
the
strategical
position
but
ghastly
to
two
battalions
of
the
division
cut
off
on
a
spit
of
land
at
lombartzyde
and
almost
annihilated
under
a
fury
of
fire
at
this
time
the
enemy
was
developing
his
use
of
a
new
mustard
gas
which
raised
blisters
and
burned
men
bodies
where
the
vapor
was
condensed
into
a
reddish
powder
and
blinded
them
for
a
week
or
more
if
not
forever
and
turned
their
lungs
to
water
i
saw
hundreds
of
these
cases
in
the
canadian
casualty
clearing
station
on
the
coast
and
there
were
thousands
all
along
our
front
at
oast
dunkerque
near
nieuport
i
had
a
whiff
of
it
and
was
conscious
of
a
burning
sensation
about
the
lips
and
eyelids
and
for
a
week
afterward
vomited
at
times
and
was
scared
by
queer
flutterings
of
the
heart
which
at
night
seemed
to
have
but
a
feeble
beat
it
was
enough
to
put
the
wind
our
men
dreaded
the
new
danger
so
mysterious
so
stealthy
in
its
approach
it
was
one
of
the
new
plagues
of
war
v
the
battle
of
flanders
began
round
ypres
on
july
with
a
greater
intensity
of
artillery
on
our
side
than
had
ever
been
seen
before
in
this
war
in
spite
of
the
somme
and
messines
when
on
big
days
of
battle
two
thousand
guns
opened
fire
on
a
single
corps
front
the
enemy
was
strong
also
in
artillery
arranged
in
great
groups
often
shifting
to
enfilade
our
lines
of
attack
the
natural
strength
of
his
position
along
the
ridges
which
were
like
a
great
bony
hand
outstretched
through
flanders
with
streams
or
beeks
as
they
are
called
flowing
in
the
valleys
which
ran
between
the
fingers
of
that
clawlike
range
were
strengthened
by
chains
of
little
concrete
forts
or
as
our
soldiers
called
them
so
arranged
that
they
could
defend
one
another
by
enfilade
fire
these
were
held
by
garrisons
of
machine
gunners
of
proved
resolution
whose
duty
was
to
break
up
our
waves
of
attack
until
even
if
successful
in
gaining
ground
only
small
bodies
of
survivors
would
be
in
a
position
to
resist
the
launched
by
german
divisions
farther
back
the
strength
of
the
pill
boxes
made
of
concrete
two
inches
thick
resisted
everything
but
the
direct
hit
of
heavy
shells
and
they
were
not
easy
targets
at
long
range
the
garrisons
within
them
fought
often
with
the
utmost
courage
even
when
surrounded
and
again
and
again
this
method
of
defense
proved
terribly
effective
against
the
desperate
heroic
assaults
of
british
infantry
what
our
men
had
suffered
in
earlier
battles
was
surpassed
by
what
they
were
now
called
upon
to
endure
all
the
agonies
of
war
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
were
piled
up
in
those
fields
of
flanders
there
was
nothing
missing
in
the
list
of
war
abominations
a
few
days
after
the
battle
began
the
rains
began
and
hardly
ceased
for
four
months
night
after
night
the
skies
opened
and
let
down
steady
torrents
which
turned
all
that
country
into
one
great
bog
of
slime
those
little
rivers
or
beeks
which
ran
between
the
knobby
fingers
of
the
clawlike
range
of
ridges
were
blown
out
of
their
channels
and
slopped
over
into
broad
swamps
the
hurricanes
of
artillery
fire
which
our
gunners
poured
upon
the
enemy
positions
for
twenty
miles
in
depth
churned
up
deep
which
intermingled
and
made
pits
which
the
rains
and
floods
filled
to
the
brim
the
only
way
of
walking
was
by
tracks
laid
down
across
the
bogs
under
enemy
fire
smashed
up
day
by
day
laid
down
again
under
cover
of
darkness
along
a
duckboard
walk
men
must
march
in
single
file
and
if
one
of
our
men
heavily
laden
in
his
stumbled
on
those
greasy
boards
as
all
of
them
stumbled
at
every
few
yards
and
fell
off
he
sank
up
to
his
knees
often
up
to
his
waist
sometimes
up
to
his
neck
in
mud
and
water
if
he
were
wounded
when
he
fell
and
darkness
was
about
him
he
could
only
cry
to
god
or
his
pals
for
he
was
helpless
otherwise
one
of
our
divisions
of
lancashire
men
the
took
eleven
hours
in
making
three
miles
or
so
out
of
ypres
across
that
ground
on
their
way
to
attack
and
then
in
spite
of
their
exhaustion
attacked
yet
week
after
week
month
after
month
our
masses
of
men
almost
every
division
in
the
british
army
at
one
time
or
another
struggled
on
through
that
slough
of
despond
capturing
ridge
after
ridge
until
the
heights
at
passchendaele
were
stormed
and
won
though
even
then
the
germans
clung
to
staden
and
westroosebeeke
when
all
our
efforts
came
to
a
dead
halt
and
that
belgian
coast
attack
was
never
launched
sir
douglas
haig
thinks
that
some
of
the
descriptions
of
that
six
months
horror
were
as
a
man
who
knows
something
of
the
value
of
words
and
who
saw
many
of
those
battle
scenes
in
flanders
and
went
out
from
ypres
many
times
during
those
months
to
the
westhoek
ridge
and
the
pilkem
ridge
to
the
frezenburg
and
inverness
copse
and
glencourse
wood
and
beyond
to
polygon
wood
and
passchendaele
where
his
dead
lay
in
the
swamps
and
round
the
and
where
tanks
that
had
wallowed
into
the
mire
were
shot
into
by
german
thirty
were
knocked
out
by
direct
hits
on
the
first
day
of
battle
and
where
our
own
guns
were
being
flung
up
by
the
harassing
fire
of
heavy
shells
i
say
now
that
nothing
that
has
been
written
is
more
than
the
pale
image
of
the
abomination
of
those
battlefields
and
that
no
pen
or
brush
has
yet
achieved
the
picture
of
that
armageddon
in
which
so
many
of
our
men
perished
they
were
months
of
ghastly
endurance
to
gunners
when
batteries
sank
up
to
their
axles
as
i
saw
them
often
while
they
fired
almost
unceasingly
for
days
and
nights
without
sleep
and
were
living
targets
of
shells
which
burst
about
them
they
were
months
of
battle
in
which
our
men
advanced
through
slime
into
slime
under
the
slash
of
bullets
shrapnel
and
high
explosives
wet
to
the
skin
chilled
to
the
bone
plastered
up
to
the
eyes
in
mud
with
a
dreadful
way
back
for
walking
wounded
and
but
little
chance
sometimes
for
wounded
who
could
not
walk
the
losses
in
many
of
these
battles
amounted
almost
to
annihilation
to
many
battalions
and
whole
divisions
lost
as
much
as
per
cent
of
their
strength
after
a
few
days
in
action
before
they
were
those
were
dreadful
losses
napoleon
said
that
no
body
of
men
could
lose
more
than
per
cent
of
their
fighting
strength
in
an
action
without
being
broken
in
spirit
our
men
lost
double
that
and
more
than
double
but
kept
their
courage
though
in
some
cases
they
lost
their
hope
the
division
of
lancashire
men
in
their
attacks
on
a
line
of
called
plum
farm
schuler
farm
and
square
farm
below
the
gravenstafel
spur
lost
men
in
casualties
out
of
those
were
not
uncommon
losses
they
were
usual
losses
one
day
fighting
in
flanders
on
october
cost
the
british
army
ten
thousand
casualties
and
they
were
considered
light
by
the
higher
command
in
relation
to
the
objects
achieved
general
harper
of
the
highland
division
told
me
that
in
his
opinion
the
official
communiques
and
the
war
correspondents
articles
gave
only
one
side
of
the
picture
of
war
and
were
too
glowing
in
their
optimism
i
did
not
tell
him
that
my
articles
were
accused
of
being
black
in
pessimism
pervading
gloom
we
tell
the
public
he
said
that
an
enemy
division
has
been
that
is
true
but
so
is
mine
one
of
my
brigades
has
lost
officers
and
two
thousand
men
since
the
he
protested
that
there
was
not
enough
liaison
between
the
and
the
higher
command
and
could
not
blame
them
for
their
hatred
of
the
the
story
of
the
two
irish
divisions
the
ulster
and
nationalist
in
their
fighting
on
august
is
black
in
tragedy
they
were
left
in
the
line
for
sixteen
days
before
the
battle
and
were
shelled
and
gassed
incessantly
as
they
crouched
in
wet
ditches
every
day
groups
of
men
were
blown
to
bits
until
the
ditches
were
bloody
and
the
living
lay
by
the
corpses
of
their
comrades
every
day
scores
of
wounded
crawled
back
through
the
bogs
if
they
had
the
strength
to
crawl
before
the
attack
on
august
the
ulster
division
had
lost
nearly
two
thousand
men
then
they
attacked
and
lost
two
thousand
more
and
over
one
hundred
officers
the
division
lost
as
many
men
before
the
attack
and
more
officers
the
dublins
had
been
annihilated
in
holding
the
line
on
the
night
before
the
battle
hundreds
of
men
were
gassed
then
their
comrades
attacked
and
lost
over
two
thousand
more
and
one
hundred
and
sixty
two
officers
all
the
ground
below
two
knolls
of
earth
called
hill
and
hill
which
were
defended
by
german
called
pond
farm
and
gallipoli
beck
house
and
borry
farm
became
an
irish
shambles
in
spite
of
their
dreadful
losses
the
survivors
in
the
irish
battalion
went
forward
to
the
assault
with
desperate
valor
on
the
morning
of
august
surrounded
the
stormed
them
through
blasts
of
fire
and
toward
the
end
of
the
day
small
bodies
of
these
men
had
gained
a
footing
on
the
objectives
which
they
had
been
asked
to
capture
but
were
then
too
weak
to
resist
german
the
and
royal
irish
fusiliers
had
been
almost
exterminated
in
their
efforts
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
hill
they
lost
seventeen
officers
out
of
and
per
cent
of
their
men
one
company
of
four
officers
and
one
hundred
men
ordered
to
capture
the
concrete
fort
known
as
borry
farm
at
all
cost
lost
four
officers
and
seventy
men
the
dublins
lost
fifteen
officers
out
of
seventeen
and
per
cent
of
their
men
the
two
irish
divisions
were
broken
to
bits
and
their
brigadiers
called
it
murder
they
were
violent
in
their
denunciation
of
the
fifth
army
for
having
put
their
men
into
the
attack
after
those
thirteen
days
of
heavy
shelling
and
after
the
battle
they
complained
that
they
were
cast
aside
like
old
shoes
no
care
being
taken
for
the
comfort
of
the
men
who
had
survived
no
were
sent
to
meet
them
and
bring
them
down
but
they
had
to
tramp
back
exhausted
and
dazed
the
remnants
of
the
division
the
poor
despairing
remnants
were
sent
without
rest
or
baths
straight
into
the
line
again
down
south
i
found
a
general
opinion
among
officers
and
men
not
only
of
the
irish
division
under
the
command
of
the
fifth
army
that
they
had
been
the
victims
of
atrocious
tragic
in
its
consequences
from
what
i
saw
of
some
of
the
fifth
army
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
some
of
these
young
gentlemen
and
some
of
the
elderly
officers
were
arrogant
and
supercilious
without
revealing
any
symptoms
of
intelligence
if
they
had
wisdom
it
was
deeply
camouflaged
by
an
air
of
inefficiency
if
they
had
knowledge
they
hid
it
as
a
secret
of
their
own
general
gough
commanding
the
fifth
army
in
flanders
and
afterward
north
and
south
of
where
the
enemy
broke
through
was
extremely
courteous
of
most
amiable
character
with
a
high
sense
of
duty
but
in
flanders
if
not
personally
responsible
for
many
tragic
happenings
he
was
badly
served
by
some
of
his
subordinates
and
battalion
officers
and
divisional
staffs
raged
against
the
whole
of
the
fifth
army
organization
or
lack
of
organization
with
an
extreme
passion
of
speech
you
must
be
glad
to
leave
flanders
i
said
to
a
group
of
officers
trekking
toward
the
cambrai
salient
one
of
them
answered
violently
god
be
thanked
we
are
leaving
the
fifth
army
area
in
an
earlier
chapter
of
this
book
i
have
already
paid
a
tribute
to
the
second
army
and
especially
to
sir
john
harington
its
chief
of
staff
there
was
a
thoroughness
of
method
a
minute
attention
to
detail
a
care
for
the
comfort
and
spirit
of
the
men
throughout
the
second
army
staff
which
did
at
least
inspire
the
troops
with
the
belief
that
whatever
they
did
in
the
had
been
prepared
and
would
be
supported
with
every
possible
help
that
organization
could
provide
that
belief
was
founded
not
upon
fine
words
spoken
on
parade
but
by
strenuous
work
a
driving
zeal
and
the
fine
intelligence
of
a
chief
of
staff
whose
brain
was
like
a
engine
i
remember
a
historic
little
scene
in
the
second
army
headquarters
at
cassel
in
a
room
where
many
of
the
great
battles
had
been
planned
when
sir
john
harington
made
the
dramatic
announcement
that
sir
herbert
plumer
and
he
as
general
plumer
chief
of
staff
had
been
ordered
to
italy
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
to
report
on
the
situation
which
had
become
so
grave
there
he
expressed
his
regret
that
he
should
have
to
leave
flanders
without
completing
all
his
plans
but
was
glad
that
passchendaele
had
been
captured
before
his
going
in
front
of
him
was
the
map
of
the
great
range
from
wytschaete
to
staden
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
it
and
smiled
and
said
i
often
used
to
think
how
much
of
that
range
we
should
get
this
year
now
it
is
nearly
all
he
thanked
the
war
correspondents
for
all
their
articles
which
had
been
very
helpful
to
the
army
and
said
how
glad
he
had
been
to
have
our
it
was
my
ambition
he
said
speaking
with
some
emotion
to
make
cordial
relations
between
battalion
officers
and
the
staff
and
to
get
rid
of
that
criticism
sometimes
just
which
has
been
directed
against
the
staff
the
second
army
has
been
able
to
show
the
fighting
soldiers
that
the
success
of
a
battle
depends
greatly
on
efficient
staff
work
and
has
inspired
them
with
confidence
in
the
preparations
and
organization
behind
the
yet
it
seemed
to
me
in
my
pessimism
and
seems
to
me
still
in
my
memory
of
all
that
ghastly
fighting
that
the
fine
mechanism
of
the
second
army
applied
to
those
battles
in
flanders
was
utterly
misspent
that
after
the
first
heavy
rains
had
fallen
the
offensive
ought
to
have
been
abandoned
and
that
it
was
a
frightful
error
of
judgment
to
ask
masses
of
men
to
attack
in
conditions
where
they
had
not
a
dog
chance
of
victory
except
at
a
cost
which
made
it
of
pyrrhic
irony
nevertheless
it
was
wearing
the
enemy
out
as
well
as
our
own
strength
in
he
could
less
afford
to
lose
his
one
man
than
we
could
our
three
now
that
the
united
states
had
entered
the
war
ludendorff
has
described
the
german
agony
and
days
of
battle
which
he
calls
terrific
inflicting
enormous
loss
upon
his
armies
and
increasing
his
anxiety
at
the
reduction
of
our
fighting
enormous
masses
of
ammunition
the
like
of
which
no
mortal
mind
before
the
war
had
conceived
were
hurled
against
human
beings
who
lay
eking
out
but
a
bare
existence
scattered
in
that
were
deep
in
slime
the
terror
of
it
surpassed
even
that
of
the
field
before
verdun
this
was
not
life
it
was
agony
unspeakable
and
out
of
the
universe
of
slime
the
attacker
wallowed
forward
slowly
but
continually
and
in
dense
masses
time
and
again
the
enemy
struck
by
the
hail
of
our
projectiles
in
the
fore
field
collapsed
and
our
lonely
men
in
the
breathed
again
then
the
mass
came
on
rifle
and
were
beslimed
the
struggle
was
man
to
man
and
only
too
often
it
was
the
mass
that
won
what
the
german
soldier
accomplished
lived
through
and
suffered
during
the
flanders
battle
will
stand
in
his
honor
for
all
time
as
a
brazen
monument
that
he
set
himself
with
his
own
hands
on
enemy
soil
the
enemy
losses
too
were
heavy
when
in
the
spring
of
we
occupied
the
battlefield
it
presented
a
horrible
spectacle
with
its
many
unburied
dead
their
number
ran
into
thousands
of
them
were
enemy
dead
were
german
soldiers
who
had
met
here
a
hero
death
and
yet
the
truth
must
be
told
individual
units
no
longer
surmounted
as
before
the
demoralizing
influences
of
the
defensive
campaign
october
and
and
november
and
were
also
days
of
pitched
battle
of
the
heaviest
kind
the
enemy
stormed
like
a
wild
bull
against
the
iron
wall
that
kept
him
at
a
distance
from
our
base
he
hurled
his
weight
against
the
houthulst
wood
he
hurled
it
against
poelcapelle
passchendaele
becelaere
gheluvelt
and
zandvoorde
at
very
many
points
he
dented
the
line
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
charge
down
the
wall
but
although
a
slight
tremor
passed
through
its
foundation
the
wall
held
the
impressions
that
i
continued
to
receive
were
extremely
grave
tactically
everything
had
been
done
the
fore
field
was
good
our
artillery
practice
had
materially
improved
behind
nearly
every
fighting
division
there
stood
a
second
as
rear
wave
in
the
third
line
too
there
were
still
reserves
we
knew
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
enemy
forces
was
high
but
we
also
knew
that
the
enemy
was
extraordinarily
strong
and
what
was
equally
important
possessed
extraordinary
that
was
the
impression
of
the
cold
brain
directing
the
machinery
of
war
from
german
headquarters
more
human
and
more
tragic
is
a
letter
of
an
unknown
german
officer
which
we
found
among
hundreds
of
others
telling
the
same
tale
in
the
mud
of
the
battlefield
if
it
were
not
for
the
men
who
have
been
spared
me
on
this
fierce
day
and
are
lying
around
me
and
looking
timidly
at
me
i
should
shed
hot
and
bitter
tears
over
the
terrors
that
have
menaced
me
during
these
hours
on
the
morning
of
september
my
dugout
containing
seventeen
men
was
shot
to
pieces
over
our
heads
i
am
the
only
one
who
withstood
the
maddening
bombardment
of
three
days
and
still
survives
you
can
not
imagine
the
frightful
mental
torments
i
have
undergone
in
those
few
hours
after
crawling
out
through
the
bleeding
remnants
of
my
comrades
and
through
the
smoke
and
debris
wandering
and
running
in
the
midst
of
the
raging
in
search
of
a
refuge
i
am
now
awaiting
death
at
any
moment
you
do
not
know
what
flanders
means
flanders
means
endless
human
endurance
flanders
means
blood
and
scraps
of
human
bodies
flanders
means
heroic
courage
and
faithfulness
even
unto
to
british
and
to
germans
it
meant
the
same
vi
during
the
four
and
a
half
months
of
that
fighting
the
war
correspondents
were
billeted
in
the
old
town
of
cassel
where
perched
on
a
hill
which
looks
over
a
wide
stretch
of
flanders
through
our
glasses
we
could
see
the
beyond
dunkirk
and
with
the
naked
eyes
the
whole
vista
of
the
round
ypres
and
in
the
wide
curve
all
the
countryside
lying
between
aire
and
hazebrouck
and
notre
dame
de
lorette
my
billet
was
in
a
monastery
for
old
priests
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
town
and
at
night
my
window
was
lighted
by
distant
and
i
gazed
out
to
a
sky
of
darkness
rent
by
vivid
flashes
bursts
of
red
flame
and
rockets
rising
high
the
priests
used
to
tap
at
my
door
when
i
came
back
from
the
battlefields
all
muddy
with
a
face
writing
furiously
and
an
old
padre
used
to
plague
me
like
that
saying
what
news
it
goes
well
eh
not
too
well
perhaps
alas
it
is
a
slaughter
on
both
it
is
all
your
fault
i
said
once
chaffingly
to
get
rid
of
him
you
do
not
pray
he
grasped
my
wrist
with
his
skinny
old
hand
monsieur
he
whispered
after
eighty
years
i
nearly
lose
my
faith
in
god
that
is
terrible
is
it
not
why
does
not
god
give
us
victory
alas
perhaps
we
have
sinned
too
much
one
needed
great
faith
for
courage
then
and
my
courage
never
much
to
boast
about
ebbed
low
those
days
when
i
agonized
over
our
losses
and
saw
the
suffering
of
our
men
and
those
foul
swamps
where
the
bodies
of
our
boys
lay
in
pools
of
slime
vividly
colored
by
the
metallic
vapors
of
high
explosives
beside
the
gashed
and
the
mangled
corpses
of
germans
who
had
died
outside
their
and
when
i
saw
dead
horses
on
the
roads
out
of
ypres
and
transport
drivers
dead
beside
their
broken
wagons
and
officers
of
ours
with
the
look
of
doomed
men
in
captured
blockhouses
where
i
took
a
nip
of
whisky
with
them
now
and
then
before
they
attacked
again
and
groups
of
dazed
prisoners
coming
down
the
tracks
through
their
own
harrowing
fire
and
always
always
streams
of
wounded
by
tens
of
thousands
there
was
an
old
near
vlamertinghe
beyond
goldfish
chateau
which
was
made
into
a
casualty
clearing
station
and
scores
of
times
when
i
passed
it
i
saw
it
crowded
with
the
walking
wounded
who
had
trudged
down
from
the
taking
eleven
hours
fourteen
hours
sometimes
to
get
so
far
they
were
no
longer
cheerful
like
the
gay
lads
who
came
lightly
wounded
out
of
earlier
battles
glad
of
life
excited
by
their
luck
they
were
silent
shivering
stricken
men
boys
in
age
but
old
and
weary
in
the
knowledge
of
war
the
slime
of
the
battlefields
had
engulfed
them
their
clothes
were
plastered
to
their
bodies
their
faces
and
hands
were
coated
with
that
whitish
clay
their
steel
hats
and
rifles
were
caked
with
it
their
eyes
brooding
were
strangely
alive
in
those
corpselike
figures
of
mud
who
huddled
round
charcoal
stoves
or
sat
motionless
on
wooden
forms
waiting
for
ambulances
yet
they
were
stark
in
spirit
still
only
the
mud
beat
us
they
said
man
after
man
said
that
we
should
have
gone
much
farther
except
for
the
along
the
menin
road
there
were
wayside
dressing
stations
for
wounded
with
surgeons
at
work
and
i
saw
the
same
scenes
there
they
were
not
beyond
the
danger
zone
doctors
and
orderlies
were
killed
by
shells
wounded
were
wounded
again
or
finished
off
some
ambulances
were
blown
to
bits
a
colonel
who
had
been
standing
in
talk
with
a
doctor
was
killed
halfway
through
a
sentence
there
was
never
a
day
in
which
ypres
was
not
shelled
by
high
velocities
which
came
howling
overhead
as
i
heard
them
scores
of
times
in
passing
through
those
ruins
with
at
the
alert
according
to
orders
and
steel
hat
strapped
on
and
a
deadly
sense
of
nostalgia
because
of
what
was
happening
in
the
fields
of
horror
that
lay
beyond
yet
to
the
soldier
farther
up
the
menin
road
ypres
was
sanctuary
and
god
heaven
the
little
old
town
of
cassel
on
the
hill
where
once
a
duke
of
york
marched
up
and
then
marched
down
again
was
beyond
though
the
enemy
tried
to
reach
it
and
dropped
shells
which
make
holes
deep
enough
to
bury
a
coach
and
horses
round
its
base
there
is
an
inn
there
the
hotel
du
sauvage
which
belongs
now
to
english
history
and
scottish
and
irish
and
welsh
and
australian
and
canadian
it
was
the
last
place
along
the
road
to
ypres
where
men
who
loved
life
could
get
a
dinner
sitting
with
their
knees
below
a
with
glinting
in
glasses
while
outside
the
windows
the
flickering
fires
of
death
told
them
how
short
might
be
their
tarrying
in
the
good
places
of
the
world
this
was
a
good
place
where
the
blinds
were
pulled
down
by
madame
who
understood
behind
the
desk
was
mademoiselle
suzanne
a
dainty
rogue
in
porcelain
with
wonderfully
bright
eyes
and
just
a
little
greeting
of
a
smile
for
any
young
officer
who
looked
her
way
trying
to
get
that
greeting
because
it
was
ever
so
long
since
he
had
seen
a
pretty
face
and
might
be
ever
so
long
again
sometimes
it
was
a
smile
met
in
the
mirror
against
the
wall
to
which
suzanne
looked
to
touch
her
curls
and
see
like
the
lady
of
shalott
the
pictures
of
life
that
passed
a
man
would
tilt
his
chair
to
get
that
angle
of
vision
outside
on
these
nights
of
war
it
was
often
blusterous
very
dark
wet
with
heavy
rain
the
door
opened
and
other
officers
came
in
with
waterproofs
sagging
round
their
legs
and
muddy
to
the
tags
abashed
because
they
made
pools

there
was
a
of
horses
hoofs
in
the
yard
i
thought
of
and
the
musketeers
who
might
have
ridden
into
this
very
yard
strode
into
this
very
room
on
their
way
to
dunkirk
or
calais
madame
played
the
piano
remarkably
well
classical
music
of
all
kinds
and
any
accompaniment
to
any
song
our
young
officers
sang
some
of
them
touched
the
piano
with
a
loving
touch
and
said
ye
gods
a
piano
again
and
played
old
melodies
or
merry
ragtime
before
passchendaele
was
taken
a
canadian
boy
brought
a
fiddle
with
him
and
played
last
of
all
after
other
tunes
the
long
long
trail
which
his
comrades
sang
come
and
play
to
us
again
said
madame
if
i
come
back
said
the
boy
he
did
not
come
back
along
the
road
through
ypres
to
cassel
from
the
balcony
one
could
see
the
nightbirds
fly
on
every
moonlight
night
german
raiders
were
about
bombing
our
camps
and
villages
one
could
see
just
below
the
hill
how
the
bombs
crashed
into
capelle
and
many
hamlets
where
british
soldiers
lay
and
where
peasants
and
children
were
killed
with
them
for
some
strange
reason
cassel
itself
was
never
bombed
we
are
a
nest
of
spies
said
some
of
the
inhabitants
but
others
had
faith
in
a
miraculous
statue
and
still
others
in
sir
herbert
plumer
once
when
a
big
shell
burst
very
close
i
looked
at
mademoiselle
suzanne
behind
the
desk
she
did
not
show
fear
by
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
though
officers
in
the
room
were
startled
vous
pas
peur
meme
de
la

you
are
not
afraid
even
of
death
i
asked
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
je
fiche
de
la
mort
i
do
care
a
damn
for
death
the
hotel
du
sauvage
was
a
pleasant
rendezvous
but
barred
for
a
time
to
young
gentlemen
of
the
air
force
who
lingered
too
long
there
sometimes
and
were
noisy
it
was
barred
to
all
officers
for
certain
hours
of
the
day
without
special
permits
from
the
who
made
trouble
in
granting
them
three
scottish
officers
rode
down
into
cassel
they
had
ridden
down
from
to
sit
at
a
table
covered
with
a
and
drink
tea
in
a
room
again
they
were
refused
permission
and
their
language
to
me
about
the
was
unprintable
they
desired
his
blood
and
bones
they
raised
their
hands
to
heaven
to
send
down
wrath
upon
all
skunks
dwelling
behind
the
lines
in
luxury
and
denying
any
kind
of
comfort
to
they
included
the
in
their
rage
and
all
from
cassel
to
boulogne
and
away
back
to
whitehall
to
cheer
up
the
war
correspondents
mess
when
we
assembled
at
night
after
miserable
days
and
when
in
the
darkness
gusts
of
wind
and
rain
clouted
the
and
distant
rumbled
or
bombs
were
falling
in
near
villages
telling
of
peasant
girls
killed
in
their
beds
and
soldiers
mangled
in
wayside
burns
we
had
the
company
sometimes
of
an
officer
a
fellow
who
told
merry
little
tales
of
executions
and
prison
happenings
at
which
he
assisted
in
the
course
of
his
duty
i
remember
one
about
a
young
officer
sentenced
to
death
for
cowardice
there
were
quite
a
number
of
lads
like
that
he
was
blindfolded
by
a
fixed
on
the
wrong
way
round
and
pinioned
and
tied
to
a
post
the
firing
party
lost
their
nerve
and
their
shots
were
wild
the
boy
was
only
wounded
and
screamed
in
his
mask
and
the
had
to
shoot
him
twice
with
his
revolver
before
he
died
that
was
only
one
of
many
little
anecdotes
told
by
a
gentleman
who
seemed
to
like
his
job
and
to
enjoy
these
reminiscences
the
battles
of
flanders
ended
with
the
capture
of
passchendaele
by
the
canadians
and
that
year
fighting
on
the
western
front
cost
us
casualties
and
though
we
had
dealt
the
enemy
heavy
blows
from
which
he
reeled
back
the
drain
upon
our
was
too
great
for
what
was
to
happen
next
year
and
our
men
were
too
sorely
tried
for
the
first
time
the
british
army
lost
its
spirit
of
optimism
and
there
was
a
sense
of
deadly
depression
among
many
officers
and
men
with
whom
i
came
in
touch
they
saw
no
ending
of
the
war
and
nothing
except
continuous
slaughter
such
as
that
in
flanders
our
men
were
not
mythical
heroes
exalted
by
the
gods
above
the
limitations
of
nature
they
were
human
beings
with
wives
and
children
or
mothers
and
sisters
whom
they
desired
to
see
again
they
hated
this
war
death
had
no
allurement
for
them
except
now
and
then
as
an
escape
from
intolerable
life
under
fire
they
would
have
been
superhuman
if
they
had
not
revolted
in
spirit
though
still
faithful
to
discipline
against
the
foul
conditions
of
warfare
in
the
swamps
where
in
spite
of
all
they
had
in
that
four
months
or
so
of
fighting
achieved
the
greatest
effort
of
human
courage
and
endurance
ever
done
by
masses
of
men
in
obedience
to
command
vii
at
the
end
of
those
battles
happened
that
surprising
audacious
adventure
in
the
cambrai
salient
organized
by
the
third
army
under
general
byng
when
on
november
squadrons
of
tanks
broke
through
the
hindenburg
line
and
infantry
streamed
through
the
breach
captured
hundreds
of
guns
ten
thousand
prisoners
many
villages
and
ridges
and
gave
a
monstrous
shock
to
the
german
high
command
the
audacity
of
the
adventure
lay
in
the
poverty
of
manpower
with
which
it
was
attempted
and
supported
the
divisions
engaged
had
all
been
through
the
grinding
mill
of
flanders
and
were
tired
men
the
artillery
was
made
up
largely
of
those
batteries
which
had
been
axle
deep
in
flanders
mud
it
was
clearly
understood
by
general
byng
and
louis
vaughan
his
chief
of
staff
that
sir
douglas
haig
could
not
afford
to
give
them
strong
reserves
to
exploit
any
success
they
might
gain
by
surprise
or
to
defend
the
captured
ground
against
certain
it
was
to
be
a
surprise
assault
by
tanks
and
infantry
with
the
hope
that
the
cavalry
corps
might
find
its
gap
at
last
and
sweep
round
cambrai
before
the
enemy
could
recover
and
reorganize
with
other
correspondents
i
saw
louis
vaughan
who
expounded
the
scheme
before
it
was
launched
that
charming
man
with
his
professional
manner
sweetness
of
speech
gentleness
of
voice
and
gesture
like
an
oxford
don
analyzing
the
war
correspondence
of
xenophon
made
no
secret
of
the
economy
with
which
the
operation
would
have
to
be
made
we
must
cut
our
coat
according
to
our
cloth
he
said
the
whole
idea
was
to
seize
only
as
much
ground
as
the
initial
success
could
gain
and
not
to
press
if
resistance
became
strong
it
was
a
gamble
with
a
chance
of
luck
the
cavalry
might
do
nothing
or
score
a
big
triumph
all
depended
on
the
surprise
of
the
tanks
if
they
were
discovered
before
the
assault
the
whole
adventure
would
fail
at
the
start
they
had
been
brought
up
secretly
by
night
four
hundred
of
them
with
for
ammunition
and
petrol
lying
hidden
in
woods
by
day
so
the
artillery
and
infantry
and
cavalry
had
been
concentrated
also
the
enemy
believed
himself
secure
in
his
hindenburg
line
which
had
been
constructed
behind
broad
hedges
of
barbed
wire
with
such
wide
ditches
that
no
tank
could
cross
how
then
would
tanks
cross
ah
that
was
a
little
trick
which
would
surprise
the
germans
mightily
each
tank
would
advance
through
the
early
morning
mists
with
a
bridge
on
its
nose
the
bridge
was
really
a
big
fascine
or
bundle
of
fagots
about
a
yard
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
controlled
by
a
lever
and
chain
from
the
interior
of
the
tank
having
plowed
through
the
barbed
wire
and
reached
the
edge
of
the
hindenburg
trench
the
tank
would
drop
the
fascine
into
the
center
of
the
ditch
stretch
out
its
long
body
reach
the
bundle
of
fagots
find
support
on
it
and
use
it
as
a
to
the
other
side
very
simple
in
idea
and
effect
so
it
happened
and
the
mists
favored
us
as
i
saw
on
the
morning
of
the
attack
at
a
little
place
called
beaumont
near
villers
pluich
the
enemy
was
completely
surprised
caught
at
breakfast
in
his
dugouts
rounded
up
in
batches
the
tanks
went
away
through
the
breach
they
had
made
with
the
infantry
swarming
round
them
and
captured
havrincourt
hermies
ribecourt
gouzeaucourt
masnieres
and
marcoing
and
a
wide
stretch
of
country
forming
a
cup
or
amphitheater
below
a
series
of
low
ridges
south
of
bourlon
wood
where
the
ground
rose
again
it
was
a
spectacular
battle
such
as
we
had
never
seen
before
and
during
the
following
days
when
our
troops
worked
up
to
bourlon
wood
and
through
the
intervening
villages
of
anneux
graincourt
containg
and
fontaine
notre
dame
i
saw
tanks
going
into
action
and
cruising
about
like
landships
with
cavalry
patrols
riding
over
open
ground
airplanes
flying
low
over
german
territory
and
masses
of
infantry
beyond
all
and
streams
of
liberated
civilians
trudging
through
the
lines
from
marcoing
the
enemy
was
demoralized
the
first
day
and
made
only
slight
resistance
the
chief
losses
of
the
tanks
were
due
to
a
german
major
of
artillery
who
served
his
own
guns
and
knocked
out
a
baker
dozen
of
these
monsters
as
they
crawled
over
the
flesquieres
ridge
i
saw
them
lying
there
with
the
blood
and
bones
of
their
pilots
and
crews
within
their
steel
walls
it
was
a
highland
soldier
who
checked
the
german
major
you
a
brave
man
he
said
but
you
got
to
dee
and
ran
him
through
the
stomach
with
his
bayonet
it
was
this
check
at
the
flesquieres
ridge
followed
by
the
breaking
of
a
bridge
at
masnieres
under
the
weight
of
a
tank
and
the
holding
of
a
called
the
rumilly
switch
by
a
battalion
of
germans
who
raced
to
it
from
cambrai
before
our
men
could
capture
it
which
thwarted
the
plans
of
the
cavalry
our
cavalry
generals
were
in
consultation
at
their
headquarters
too
far
back
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
the
situation
they
waited
for
the
capture
of
the
rumilly
switch
and
held
up
masses
of
cavalry
whom
i
saw
riding
through
the
village
of
ribecourt
with
excitement
and
exaltation
because
they
thought
that
at
last
their
chance
had
come
finally
orders
were
given
to
cancel
all
previous
plans
to
advance
only
one
squadron
belonging
to
the
canadian
fort
garry
horse
in
general
seely
division
failed
to
receive
the
order
their
colonel
rode
after
them
but
his
horse
slipped
and
fell
before
he
caught
them
up
and
it
was
their
day
of
heroic
folly
they
rode
fast
and
made
their
way
through
a
gap
in
the
wire
cut
by
the
troopers
and
came
under
rifle
and
fire
which
wounded
the
captain
and
several
men
the
command
was
carried
on
by
a
young
lieutenant
who
rode
with
his
men
until
they
reached
the
camouflaged
road
southeast
of
the
village
of
rumilly
where
they
went
through
in
sections
under
the
fire
of
the
enemy
hidden
in
the
banks
here
they
came
up
against
a
battery
of
one
of
which
fired
at
them
they
charged
the
battery
putting
the
guns
out
of
action
and
killing
some
of
the
gunners
those
who
were
not
destroyed
surrendered
and
the
prisoners
were
left
to
be
sent
back
by
the
supports
the
squadron
then
dealt
with
the
german
infantry
in
the
neighborhood
some
of
them
fled
while
some
were
killed
or
surrendered
all
these
operations
were
done
at
a
gallop
under
fire
from
flanking
blockhouses
the
squadron
then
slowed
down
to
a
walk
and
took
up
a
position
in
a
sunken
road
one
kilometer
east
of
rumilly
darkness
crept
down
upon
them
and
gradually
they
were
surrounded
by
german
infantry
with
so
that
they
were
in
great
danger
of
capture
or
destruction
only
five
of
their
horses
remained
unhit
and
the
lieutenant
in
command
decided
that
they
must
endeavor
to
cut
their
way
through
and
get
back
the
horses
were
stampeded
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
in
order
to
draw
the
fire
and
while
these
riderless
horses
galloped
wildly
out
of
one
end
of
the
sunken
road
the
officer
and
his
surviving
troopers
escaped
from
the
other
end
on
the
way
back
they
encountered
four
bodies
of
the
enemy
whom
they
attacked
and
routed
on
one
occasion
their
escape
was
due
to
the
cunning
of
another
young
lieutenant
who
spoke
german
and
held
conversations
with
the
enemy
in
the
darkness
deceiving
them
as
to
the
identity
of
his
force
until
they
were
able
to
take
the
german
troops
by
surprise
and
hack
a
way
through
this
lieutenant
was
hit
in
the
face
by
a
bullet
and
when
he
arrived
back
in
masnieres
with
his
men
in
advance
of
the
he
was
only
able
to
make
his
report
before
falling
in
a
state
of
collapse
other
small
bodies
of
cavalry
among
them
the
dragoons
and
hussars
had
wild
heroic
adventures
in
the
cambrai
salient
where
they
rode
under
blasts
of
fire
and
rounded
up
prisoners
in
the
ruined
villages
of
noyelles
and
fontaine
notre
dame
some
of
them
went
into
the
folie
wood
nearby
and
met
seven
german
officers
strolling
about
the
glades
as
though
no
war
was
on
they
took
them
prisoners
but
had
to
release
some
of
them
later
as
they
could
not
be
bothered
with
them
later
they
came
across
six
ammunition
wagons
and
destroyed
them
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
was
one
of
the
german
divisional
headquarters
and
one
of
our
cavalry
officers
dismounted
and
approached
the
cottage
stealthily
and
looked
through
the
windows
inside
was
a
party
of
german
officers
seated
at
a
table
with
beer
mugs
in
front
of
them
apparently
unconscious
of
any
danger
near
them
our
officer
fired
his
revolver
through
the
windows
and
then
like
a
schoolboy
who
has
thrown
a
stone
ran
away
as
hard
as
he
could
and
joined
his
troop
youthful
folly
of
gallant
hearts
after
the
enemy
surprise
his
resistance
stiffened
and
he
held
the
village
of
fontaine
notre
dame
and
bourlon
wood
on
the
hill
above
with
strong
very
quickly
too
he
brought
new
batteries
into
action
and
things
became
unpleasant
in
fields
and
villages
where
our
men
as
i
saw
them
on
those
days
hunted
around
for
souvenirs
in
german
dugouts
and
found
automatic
pistols
and
other
good
booty
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
plan
as
outlined
by
louis
vaughan
not
to
exploit
success
farther
than
justified
by
the
initial
surprise
was
abandoned
for
a
time
a
brigade
of
guards
was
put
in
to
attack
fontaine
notre
dame
and
suffered
heavily
from
fire
before
taking
it
the
yorkshire
division
lost
many
good
men
in
bourlon
village
and
bourlon
wood
into
which
the
enemy
poured
and
high
explosives
then
on
november
the
germans
under
the
direction
of
general
von
marwitz
came
back
upon
us
with
a
tiger
pounce
in
a
surprise
attack
which
we
ought
to
have
anticipated
i
happened
to
be
on
the
way
to
gouzeaucourt
early
that
morning
and
going
through
the
village
of
fins
next
to
it
i
saw
men
straggling
back
in
some
disorder
and
wedged
in
a
dense
traffic
moving
in
what
seemed
to
me
the
wrong
direction
i
do
know
what
to
do
said
a
young
gunner
officer
my
battery
has
been
captured
and
i
ca
get
into
touch
with
the
what
has
happened
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
do
you
know
the
enemy
has
broken
broken
through
where
the
gunner
officer
pointed
down
the
road
at
the
present
moment
he
in
i
went
northward
and
saw
that
places
like
hermies
and
havrincourt
which
had
been
peaceful
spots
for
a
few
days
were
under
heavy
fire
bourlon
wood
beyond
was
a
fiery
furnace
hell
had
broken
out
again
and
things
looked
bad
there
was
a
general
packing
up
of
dumps
and
field
hospitals
and
heavy
batteries
in
gouzeaucourt
and
other
places
our
divisional
and
brigade
headquarters
were
caught
napping
officers
were
in
their
pajamas
or
in
their
baths
when
they
heard
the
snap
of
bullets
i
saw
the
guards
go
forward
to
gouzeaucourt
for
a
they
came
along
munching
apples
and
whistling
as
though
on
peace
maneuvers
next
day
after
they
had
gained
back
gouzeaucourt
i
saw
many
of
them
wounded
lying
under
tarpaulins
all
dirty
and
bloody
the
germans
had
adopted
our
own
way
of
attack
they
had
assembled
masses
of
troops
secretly
moving
them
forward
by
night
under
the
cover
of
woods
so
that
our
air
scouts
saw
no
movement
by
day
our
line
was
weakly
held
along
the
front
the
division
thinned
out
by
losses
was
holding
a
line
of
thirteen
thousand
yards
three
times
as
much
as
any
troops
can
hold
in
safety
and
the
german
after
a
short
terrific
bombardment
broke
through
to
a
distance
of
five
miles
our
tired
men
who
had
gained
the
first
victory
fought
heroic
actions
back
from
masnieres
and
marcoing
and
back
from
bourlon
wood
on
the
northern
side
of
the
salient
they
made
the
enemy
pay
a
high
price
in
blood
for
the
success
of
his
but
we
lost
many
thousands
of
brave
fellows
and
the
joy
bells
which
had
rung
in
london
on
november
became
sad
and
ironical
music
in
the
hearts
of
our
disappointed
people
so
ended
our
black
year
and
in
the
spring
of
after
all
the
losses
of
that
year
our
armies
on
the
western
front
were
threatened
by
the
greatest
menace
that
had
ever
drawn
near
to
them
and
the
british
empire
was
in
jeopardy
viii
in
the
autumn
of
the
italian
disaster
of
caporetto
had
happened
and
sir
herbert
plumer
with
his
chief
of
staff
sir
john
harington
and
many
of
the
second
army
had
as
i
have
told
been
sent
to
italy
with
some
of
our
best
divisions
so
weakening
sir
douglas
haig
command
at
that
very
time
also
after
the
bloody
losses
in
flanders
the
french
government
and
general
headquarters
brought
severe
pressure
upon
the
british
war
council
to
take
over
a
greater
length
of
line
in
france
in
order
to
release
some
of
the
older
classes
of
the
french
army
who
had
been
under
arms
since
we
yielded
to
that
pressure
and
sir
douglas
haig
extended
his
lines
north
and
south
of
where
the
fifth
army
under
general
gough
was
intrusted
with
the
defense
i
went
over
all
that
new
ground
of
ours
out
from
noyon
to
chaulny
and
barisis
and
the
floods
of
the
oise
by
la
fere
out
from
ham
to
holmon
forest
and
francilly
and
the
epine
de
dullon
and
the
fort
de
liez
by
and
from
peronne
to
hargicourt
and
jeancourt
and
la
verguier
it
was
a
pleasant
country
with
living
trees
and
green
fields
not
annihilated
by
though
with
the
naked
eye
i
could
see
the
scarred
walls
of
cathedral
and
the
villages
near
the
frontlines
had
been
damaged
in
the
usual
way
it
was
dead
quiet
there
for
miles
except
for
short
bursts
of
harassing
fire
now
and
then
and
odd
shells
here
and
there
and
bursts
of
black
shrapnel
in
the
blue
sky
of
mild
days
paradise
after
flanders
said
our
men
but
i
knew
that
there
was
a
great
movement
of
troops
westward
from
russia
and
wondered
how
long
this
paradise
would
last
i
looked
about
for
trench
systems
support
lines
and
did
not
see
them
and
wondered
what
our
defense
would
be
if
the
enemy
attacked
here
in
great
strength
our
army
seemed
wonderfully
thinned
out
there
were
few
men
to
be
seen
in
our
outpost
line
or
in
reserve
it
was
all
strangely
quiet
alarmingly
quiet
yet
pleasant
for
the
time
being
i
had
a
brother
commanding
a
battery
along
the
railway
line
south
of
i
went
to
see
him
and
we
had
a
picnic
meal
on
a
little
hill
staring
straight
toward
cathedral
one
of
his
junior
officers
set
the
gramophone
going
the
colonel
of
the
artillery
brigade
came
jogging
up
on
his
horse
and
called
out
fine
morning
and
a
pretty
spot
the
infantry
divisions
were
cheerful
like
a
they
said
they
had
sports
almost
within
sight
of
the
german
lines
i
saw
a
in
an
irish
battalion
and
while
two
fellows
hammered
each
other
i
glanced
away
from
them
to
winding
wavy
lines
of
chalk
on
the
opposite
hillsides
and
wondered
what
was
happening
behind
them
in
that
quietude
what
do
you
think
about
this
german
offensive
i
asked
the
general
of
a
london
division
general
gorringe
of
the
standing
on
a
wagon
and
watching
a
war
from
that
place
also
we
could
see
the
german
positions
has
got
the
he
said
it
is
all
general
hall
temporarily
commanding
the
irish
division
was
of
the
same
opinion
and
took
some
pains
to
explain
the
folly
of
thinking
the
germans
would
attack
yet
day
after
day
week
after
week
the
intelligence
reports
were
full
of
evidence
of
immense
movements
of
troops
westward
of
intensive
training
of
german
divisions
in
back
areas
of
new
hospitals
airplanes
battery
positions
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
as
to
the
enemy
intentions
intelligence
officers
took
me
on
one
side
and
said
england
ought
to
know
the
people
ought
to
be
prepared
all
this
is
very
serious
we
shall
be
against
it
was
convinced
on
february
the
war
correspondents
published
articles
summarizing
the
evidence
pointing
out
the
gravity
of
the
menace
and
they
were
passed
by
the
censorship
but
england
was
not
scared
dances
were
in
full
swing
in
london
little
ladies
laughed
as
usual
flanders
had
made
no
difference
to
national
optimism
though
the
hospitals
were
crowded
with
blind
and
maimed
and
i
am
skeptical
of
the
german
offensive
said
bonar
law
nobody
believed
the
war
correspondents
nobody
ever
did
believe
us
though
some
of
us
wrote
the
truth
from
first
to
last
as
far
as
the
facts
of
war
go
apart
from
deeper
psychology
and
a
naked
realism
of
horrors
and
losses
and
criticism
of
facts
which
did
not
come
within
our
liberty
of
the
pen
they
were
strange
months
for
me
i
felt
that
i
was
in
possession
as
indeed
i
was
of
a
terrible
secret
which
might
lead
to
the
ending
of
the
world
our
world
as
we
knew
it
with
our
liberties
and
power
for
weeks
i
had
been
pledged
to
say
no
word
about
it
to
write
not
a
word
about
it
and
it
was
like
being
haunted
by
a
specter
all
day
long
one
laughed
but
the
specter
echoed
one
laughter
and
said
wait
the
mild
sunshine
of
those
spring
days
was
pleasant
to
one
spirit
in
the
woods
above
la
fere
and
in
fields
where
chattered
a
little
while
overhead
our
airplanes
dodged
german
but
the
specter
chilled
one
blood
at
the
reminder
of
vast
masses
of
men
drawing
nearer
to
our
lines
in
overwhelming
numbers
i
motored
to
many
parts
of
the
front
and
my
companion
sometimes
was
a
little
frenchman
who
had
lost
a
leg
in
the
war
with
a
wooden
peg
most
valiant
most
gay
along
the
way
he
recited
the
poems
of
ronsard
at
the
journey
end
one
day
he
sang
old
french
chansons
in
an
english
mess
within
gunshot
of
the
german
lines
he
climbed
up
a
tree
and
gazed
at
the
german
positions
and
made
sketches
while
he
hummed
little
tunes
and
said
between
them
ah
les
sacres
boches
if
only
i
could
fight
again
i
remember
a
pleasant
dinner
in
the
old
town
of
noyon
in
a
little
restaurant
where
two
pretty
girls
waited
they
had
come
from
paris
with
their
parents
to
start
this
business
now
that
noyon
was
safe
safe
o
lord
and
everything
was
very
dainty
and
clean
at
dinner
that
night
there
was
a
hostile
air
raid
overhead
bombs
crashed
but
the
girls
were
brave
one
of
them
volunteered
to
go
with
an
officer
across
the
square
to
show
him
the
way
to
the
from
where
he
had
to
get
a
pass
to
stay
for
dinner
shrapnel
bullets
were
whipping
the
flagstones
of
the
grande
place
from
guns
the
officer
wore
his
steel
helmet
the
girl
was
going
out
without
any
hat
above
her
braided
hair
we
did
not
let
her
go
and
the
officer
had
another
guide
one
night
i
brought
my
brother
to
the
place
from
his
battery
near
quentin
we
dined
well
slept
well
noyon
is
a
good
spot
he
said
i
shall
come
here
again
when
you
give
me
a
a
few
days
later
my
brother
was
firing
at
masses
of
germans
with
open
sights
and
the
british
army
was
in
a
retreat
and
the
junior
officer
who
had
played
his
gramophone
was
dead
with
other
officers
and
men
of
that
battery
when
i
next
passed
through
noyon
shells
were
falling
into
it
and
later
i
saw
it
in
ruins
with
the
glory
of
the
romanesque
cathedral
sadly
scarred
i
have
ofttimes
wondered
what
happened
to
the
little
family
in
the
old
hotel
so
march
came
as
we
knew
it
would
come
even
to
the
very
date
and
ludendorff
played
his
trump
cards
and
the
great
game
before
that
date
i
had
an
interview
with
general
gough
commanding
the
fifth
army
he
pulled
out
his
maps
showed
his
method
of
forward
redoubts
beyond
the
main
battle
zone
and
in
a
quiet
amiable
way
spoke
some
words
which
froze
my
blood
we
may
have
to
give
ground
he
said
if
the
enemy
attacks
in
strength
we
may
have
to
fall
back
to
our
main
battle
zone
that
will
not
matter
very
much
it
is
possible
that
we
may
have
to
go
farther
back
our
real
line
of
defense
is
the
somme
it
will
be
nothing
like
a
tragedy
if
we
hold
that
if
we
lose
the
crossings
of
the
somme
it
will
of
course
be
serious
but
not
a
tragedy
even
then
it
will
only
be
tragic
if
we
lose
amiens
and
we
must
not
do
the
crossings
of
the
somme
amiens
such
a
thought
had
never
entered
my
imagination
general
gough
had
suggested
terrible
possibilities
all
but
the
worst
happened
in
my
despatches
reprinted
in
book
form
with
explanatory
prefaces
i
have
told
in
full
detail
the
meaning
and
measure
of
the
british
retreat
when
of
our
divisions
were
attacked
by
one
hundred
and
fourteen
german
divisions
and
fell
back
fighting
stubborn
actions
which
at
last
brought
the
enemy
to
a
dead
halt
outside
amiens
and
along
the
river
ancre
northward
from
albert
where
afterward
in
a
northern
attack
the
enemy
under
prince
rupprecht
of
bavaria
broke
through
the
portuguese
between
givenchy
and
festubert
where
our
wings
held
drove
up
to
bailleul
which
was
burned
to
the
ground
and
caused
us
to
abandon
all
the
ridges
of
flanders
which
had
been
gained
at
such
great
cost
and
fall
back
to
the
edge
of
ypres
in
this
book
i
need
not
narrate
all
this
history
again
they
were
evil
days
for
us
the
german
offensive
was
conducted
with
masterly
skill
according
to
the
new
method
of
infiltration
which
had
been
tried
against
italy
with
great
success
in
the
autumn
of
at
caporetto
it
consisted
in
a
penetration
of
our
lines
by
wedges
of
constantly
reinforced
and
working
inward
so
that
our
men
attacked
frontally
after
terrific
bombardment
found
themselves
under
flanking
fire
on
their
right
and
left
and
in
danger
of
being
cut
off
taking
advantage
of
a
dense
fog
for
which
they
had
waited
according
to
meteorological
forecast
the
germans
had
easily
made
their
way
between
our
forward
redoubts
on
the
fifth
army
front
where
our
garrisons
held
out
for
a
long
time
completely
surrounded
and
penetrated
our
inner
battle
zone
through
the
gaps
they
made
they
came
in
masses
at
a
great
pace
with
immense
machine
gun
strength
and
light
artillery
on
the
third
army
front
where
penetrations
were
made
notably
near
bullecourt
between
the
and
divisions
the
whole
of
our
army
machine
was
upset
for
a
time
like
a
watch
with
a
broken
mainspring
and
loose
wheels
staffs
lost
touch
with
fighting
units
communications
were
broken
down
orders
were
given
but
not
received
after
enormous
losses
of
men
and
guns
our
heavy
artillery
was
choking
the
roads
of
escape
while
our
fought
for
time
rather
than
for
ground
the
crossings
of
the
somme
were
lost
too
easily
in
the
confusion
and
tumult
of
those
days
some
of
our
men
being
human
were
demoralized
and
and
gave
ground
which
might
have
been
longer
held
but
on
the
whole
and
in
the
mass
there
was
no
panic
and
a
most
grim
valor
of
men
who
fought
for
days
and
nights
without
sleep
fought
when
they
were
almost
surrounded
or
quite
surrounded
and
until
few
of
them
remained
to
hold
any
kind
of
line
fortunately
the
germans
were
unable
to
drag
their
heavy
guns
over
the
desert
they
had
made
a
year
before
in
their
own
retreat
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
their
pace
slackened
and
they
halted
in
exhaustion
i
went
into
the
swirl
of
our
retreat
day
after
day
up
by
guiscard
and
hum
then
as
the
line
moved
back
by
peronne
and
bapaume
and
at
last
on
a
dreadful
day
by
the
windmill
at
pozieres
our
old
heroic
where
once
again
after
many
battles
the
enemy
was
in
courcelette
and
high
wood
and
delville
wood
and
as
i
saw
by
going
to
the
right
through
albert
driving
hard
up
to
mametz
and
montauban
that
meant
the
loss
of
all
the
old
somme
battlefields
and
that
struck
a
chill
in
one
heart
but
what
i
marveled
at
always
was
the
absence
of
panic
the
fatalistic
acceptance
of
the
turn
of
fortune
wheel
by
many
officers
and
men
and
the
refusal
of
corps
and
divisional
staffs
to
give
way
to
despair
in
those
days
of
tragedy
and
crisis
the
northern
attack
was
in
many
ways
worse
to
bear
and
worse
to
see
the
menace
to
the
coast
was
frightful
when
the
enemy
struck
up
to
bailleul
and
captured
kemmel
hill
from
a
french
regiment
which
had
come
up
to
relieve
some
of
our
exhausted
and
unsupported
men
all
through
this
country
between
estaires
and
merville
to
steenwerck
metern
and
bailleul
thousands
of
civilians
had
been
living
on
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
believing
themselves
safe
behind
our
lines
now
the
line
had
slipped
and
they
were
caught
by
german
and
german
guns
and
after
nearly
four
years
of
war
had
to
abandon
their
homes
like
the
first
fugitives
i
saw
old
women
coming
down
lanes
where
were
bursting
and
where
our
gunners
were
getting
into
action
i
saw
young
mothers
packing
their
babies
and
their
bundles
into
perambulators
while
shells
came
hurtling
over
the
thatched
roofs
of
their
cottages
i
stood
on
the
mont
des
chats
looking
down
upon
a
wide
sweep
of
battle
and
saw
many
little
farmsteads
on
fire
and
bailleul
one
torch
of
flame
and
smoke
there
was
an
old
monastery
on
the
mont
des
chats
which
had
been
in
the
midst
of
a
cavalry
battle
in
october
of
when
prince
max
of
hesse
the
kaiser
cousin
was
mortally
wounded
by
a
shot
from
one
of
our
troopers
he
was
carried
into
the
cell
of
the
old
prior
who
watched
over
him
in
his
dying
hours
when
he
spoke
of
his
family
and
friends
then
his
body
was
borne
down
the
hill
at
night
and
buried
secretly
by
a
parish
priest
and
when
the
kaiser
wrote
to
the
pope
desiring
to
know
the
whereabouts
of
his
cousin
grave
the
priest
to
whom
his
message
was
conveyed
said
tell
the
kaiser
he
shall
know
when
the
german
armies
have
departed
from
belgium
and
when
reparation
has
been
made
for
all
their
evil
it
was
the
prior
who
told
me
that
story
and
who
described
to
me
how
the
british
cavalry
had
forged
their
way
up
the
hill
he
showed
me
the
scars
of
bullets
on
the
walls
and
the
windows
from
which
the
monks
looked
out
upon
the
battle
all
that
is
a
wonderful
memory
said
the
prior
thanks
to
the
english
we
are
safe
and
beyond
the
range
of
german
i
thought
of
his
words
that
day
i
climbed
the
hill
to
see
the
sweep
of
battle
beyond
the
monastery
was
no
longer
beyond
the
range
of
german
shells
an
eight
inch
shell
had
just
smashed
into
the
prior
parlor
others
had
opened
gaps
in
the
high
roofs
and
walls
the
monks
had
fled
by
order
of
the
prior
who
stayed
behind
like
the
captain
of
a
sinking
ship
his
corridors
resounded
to
the
tramp
of
army
boots
the
ulster
gunners
had
made
their
headquarters
in
the
refectory
but
did
not
stay
there
long
a
few
days
later
the
monastery
was
a
ruin
from
many
little
villages
caught
by
the
oncoming
tide
of
war
our
soldiers
helped
the
people
to
escape
in
lorries
or
on
they
did
not
weep
nor
say
much
but
were
wonderfully
brave
i
remember
a
little
family
in
robecq
whom
i
packed
into
my
car
when
shells
began
to
fall
among
the
houses
a
pretty
girl
with
a
little
invalid
brother
in
her
arms
and
a
mother
by
her
side
pointed
the
way
to
a
cottage
in
a
wood
some
miles
away
she
was
gay
and
smiling
when
she
said
au
revoir
et
merci
a
few
days
later
the
cottage
and
the
wood
were
behind
the
german
lines
the
northern
defense
by
the
lancashires
highlanders
who
had
been
all
through
the
somme
retreat
the
division
of
cheshires
wiltshires
and
lancashire
fusiliers
and
the
scottish
division
and
others
who
fought
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
as
sir
douglas
haig
demanded
of
them
without
reliefs
until
they
were
worn
thin
was
heroic
and
tragic
in
its
ordeal
until
foch
sent
up
his
cavalry
i
saw
them
riding
in
clouds
of
dust
and
heard
the
panting
of
their
horses
followed
by
divisions
of
blue
men
in
hundreds
of
blue
lorries
tearing
up
the
roads
and
forming
a
strong
blue
line
behind
our
thin
brown
line
prince
rupprecht
of
bavaria
had
fresh
divisions
in
reserve
but
had
to
hold
them
until
other
plans
were
developed
the
crown
prince
plan
against
the
french
and
the
attack
on
arras
the
defense
of
arras
by
the
and
divisions
the
iron
division
and
the
london
division
on
the
left
and
by
the
division
and
guards
on
the
right
saved
the
center
of
our
line
and
all
our
line
we
had
a
breathing
space
while
heavy
blows
fell
against
the
french
and
against
three
british
divisions
who
had
been
sent
to
hold
a
quiet
sector
on
their
right
the
germans
drove
across
the
chemin
des
dames
struck
right
and
left
terrific
blows
beat
the
french
back
reached
the
marne
again
and
threatened
paris
foch
waited
to
strike
the
genius
of
foch
was
that
he
waited
until
the
last
minute
of
safety
taking
immense
risks
in
order
to
be
certain
of
his
for
a
time
he
had
to
dissipate
his
reserves
but
he
gathered
them
together
again
as
quick
as
the
blue
men
had
come
up
behind
our
lines
they
were
withdrawn
again
three
of
our
divisions
went
with
them
the
highlanders
and
scottish
and
the
english
the
flower
of
the
french
army
the
veterans
of
many
battles
was
massed
behind
the
marne
and
at
chateau
thierry
the
american
marines
and
infantry
were
given
their
first
big
job
to
do
what
happened
all
the
world
knows
the
crown
prince
army
was
attacked
on
both
flanks
and
in
the
center
and
was
sent
reeling
back
to
escape
complete
annihilation
ix
ludendorff
great
offensive
had
failed
and
had
turned
to
ruin
some
of
the
fresh
divisions
under
rupprecht
of
bavaria
were
put
into
the
to
save
the
crown
prince
the
british
army
with
its
gaps
filled
up
by
new
drafts
from
england
the
young
brothers
of
the
elder
brothers
who
had
gone
before
was
ready
to
strike
again
and
on
august
the
canadians
and
australians
north
and
south
of
the
somme
led
by
many
tanks
broke
the
enemy
line
beyond
amiens
and
slowly
but
surely
rolled
it
back
with
enormous
losses
for
the
first
time
in
the
war
the
cavalry
had
their
chance
of
pursuit
and
made
full
use
of
it
rounding
up
great
batches
of
prisoners
capturing
batteries
of
heavy
and
light
guns
and
fighting
in
many
actions
august
writes
ludendorff
was
the
black
day
of
the
german
army
in
the
history
of
this
he
describes
from
the
german
point
of
view
what
i
and
others
have
described
from
the
british
point
of
view
and
the
general
narrative
is
the
same
a
succession
of
by
the
british
armies
which
broke
not
only
the
german
but
the
german
spirit
it
was
a
marvelous
feat
when
the
division
and
the
welsh
waded
at
dusk
across
the
foul
waters
of
the
river
ancre
under
the
heights
of
thiepval
assembled
under
the
guns
of
the
enemy
up
there
and
then
wet
to
their
skins
and
in
small
numbers
compared
with
the
strength
of
the
enemy
stormed
the
huge
ridges
from
both
sides
and
hurled
the
enemy
back
from
what
he
thought
was
an
impregnable
position
and
followed
him
day
by
day
taking
thousands
of
prisoners
and
smashing
his
defenses
one
by
one
the
most
decisive
battle
of
the
british
front
in
the
after
our
days
of
retreat
was
when
with
the
gallant
help
of
american
troops
of
the
new
york
division
our
men
of
the
english
midlands
the
division
and
others
broke
the
main
hindenburg
line
along
the
canal
that
canal
was
sixty
feet
wide
with
steep
cliffs
rising
sheer
to
a
wonderful
system
of
german
redoubts
and
tunneled
defenses
between
the
villages
of
bellicourt
and
bellinglis
it
seemed
to
me
an
impossible
place
to
assault
and
capture
if
the
enemy
could
not
hold
that
line
they
could
hold
nothing
in
a
dense
fog
on
sunday
morning
september
our
men
with
the
americans
and
australians
in
support
went
down
to
the
waded
across
where
the
water
was
shallow
swam
across
in
where
it
was
deep
or
got
across
somehow
and
anyhow
under
blasts
of
fire
by
rafts
and
plank
bridges
a
few
hours
after
the
beginning
of
the
battle
they
were
far
out
beyond
the
german
side
of
the
canal
with
masses
of
prisoners
in
their
hands
the
americans
on
the
left
of
the
attack
where
the
canal
goes
below
ground
showed
superb
and
reckless
gallantry
they
forgot
however
to
mop
up
behind
them
so
that
the
enemy
came
out
of
his
tunnels
and
the
australians
had
to
cut
their
way
through
and
that
evening
i
met
their
escorts
with
droves
of
captured
germans
they
had
helped
to
break
the
last
defensive
system
of
the
enemy
opposite
the
british
front
and
after
that
our
troops
fought
through
open
country
on
the
way
to
victory
i
saw
many
of
the
scenes
which
led
up
to
mons
and
le
cateau
and
afterward
to
the
rhine
something
of
the
horror
of
war
passed
when
the
enemy
drew
back
slowly
in
retreat
from
the
lands
he
had
invaded
and
we
liberated
great
cities
like
lille
and
roubaix
and
tourcoing
and
scores
of
towns
and
villages
where
the
people
had
been
waiting
for
us
so
long
and
now
wept
with
joy
to
see
us
the
entry
into
lille
was
unforgetable
when
old
men
and
women
and
girls
and
boys
and
little
children
crowded
round
us
and
kissed
our
hands
so
it
was
in
other
places
yet
not
all
the
horror
had
passed
in
courtrai
in
by
valenciennes
in
bohain
and
other
villages
the
enemy
and
killed
and
injured
many
of
the
people
who
had
been
under
the
german
yoke
so
long
and
now
thought
they
were
safe
hospitals
were
filled
with
women
gasping
for
breath
with
in
their
lungs
and
with
dying
children
in
valenciennes
the
cellars
were
flooded
when
i
walked
there
on
its
day
of
capture
so
that
when
shells
began
to
fall
the
people
could
not
go
down
to
shelter
some
of
them
did
not
try
to
go
down
at
an
open
window
sat
an
old
veteran
of
with
his
medal
on
his
breast
and
with
his
daughter
and
granddaughter
on
each
side
of
his
chair
he
called
out
merci
merci
when
english
soldiers
passed
and
when
i
stopped
a
moment
clasped
my
hands
through
the
window
and
could
not
speak
for
the
tears
which
fell
down
his
white
and
withered
cheeks
a
few
dead
germans
lay
about
the
streets
and
in
maubeuge
on
the
day
before
the
armistice
i
saw
the
last
dead
german
of
the
war
in
that
part
of
the
line
he
lay
stretched
outside
the
railway
station
into
which
many
shells
had
crashed
it
was
as
though
he
had
walked
from
his
own
comrades
toward
our
line
before
a
bullet
caught
him
ludendorff
writes
of
the
broken
morale
of
the
german
troops
and
of
how
his
men
surrendered
to
single
troopers
of
ours
while
whole
detachments
gave
themselves
up
to
tanks
retiring
troops
he
wrote
greeted
one
particular
division
the
cavalry
that
was
going
up
fresh
and
gallantly
to
the
attack
with
shouts
of
and
that
is
true
when
the
germans
left
bohain
they
shouted
out
to
the
french
girls
the
english
are
coming
bravo
the
war
will
soon
be
over
on
a
day
in
september
when
british
troops
broke
the
line
i
saw
the
second
german
guards
coming
along
in
batches
like
companies
and
after
they
had
been
put
in
inclosures
they
laughed
and
clapped
at
the
sight
of
other
crowds
of
comrades
coming
down
as
prisoners
i
thought
then
something
has
broken
in
the
german
for
the
first
time
the
end
seemed
very
near
yet
the
german
fought
stubbornly
in
many
places
especially
in
the
last
battles
round
cambrai
where
on
the
north
the
canadian
corps
had
to
fight
desperately
and
suffered
heavy
and
bitter
losses
under
fire
while
on
the
south
our
naval
division
and
others
were
badly
cut
up
general
currie
whom
i
saw
during
those
days
was
anxious
and
disheartened
he
was
losing
more
men
in
actions
round
cambrai
than
in
bigger
battles
i
watched
those
actions
from
bourlon
wood
saw
the
last
german
railway
train
steam
out
of
the
town
and
went
into
the
city
early
on
the
morning
of
its
capture
when
there
was
a
roaring
fire
in
the
heart
of
it
and
the
canadians
were
routing
out
the
last
germans
from
their
the
british
army
could
not
have
gone
on
much
farther
after
november
when
the
armistice
brought
us
to
a
halt
for
three
months
our
troops
had
fought
incessantly
storming
many
villages
strongly
garrisoned
with
crossing
many
canals
under
heavy
fire
and
losing
many
comrades
all
along
the
way
the
pace
could
not
have
been
kept
up
there
is
a
limit
even
to
the
valor
of
british
troops
and
for
a
time
we
had
reached
that
limit
there
were
not
many
divisions
who
could
have
staggered
on
to
new
attacks
without
rest
and
relief
but
they
had
broken
the
german
armies
against
them
by
a
succession
of
astounding
in
their
rapidity
and
in
their
continuity
which
i
need
not
here
describe
in
detail
because
in
my
despatches
now
in
book
form
i
have
narrated
that
history
as
i
was
a
witness
of
it
day
by
day
elsewhere
the
french
and
americans
had
done
their
part
with
steady
driving
pressure
the
illimitable
reserves
of
americans
and
their
fighting
quality
which
triumphed
over
a
faulty
organization
of
transport
and
supplies
left
the
german
high
command
without
hope
even
for
a
final
gamble
before
them
the
german
troops
were
in
revolt
at
last
against
the
bloody
futile
sacrifice
of
their
manhood
and
people
a
blinding
light
had
come
to
them
revealing
the
criminality
of
their
war
lords
in
this
great
swindle
against
their
race
it
was
defeat
and
agony
which
enlightened
them
as
most
people
even
ourselves
are
enlightened
only
by
suffering
and
disillusionment
and
never
by
successes
x
after
the
armistice
i
went
with
our
troops
to
the
rhine
and
entered
cologne
with
them
that
was
the
most
fantastic
adventure
of
all
in
four
and
a
half
years
of
strange
and
terrible
adventures
to
me
there
was
no
wild
exultation
in
the
thought
of
being
in
cologne
with
our
conquering
army
the
thought
of
all
the
losses
on
the
way
and
of
all
the
futility
of
this
strife
smote
at
one
heart
what
fools
the
germans
had
been
what
tragic
fools
what
a
mad
villainy
there
had
been
among
rival
dynasties
and
powers
and
politicians
and
peoples
to
lead
to
this
massacre
what
had
any
one
gained
out
of
it
all
nothing
except
ruin
nothing
except
great
death
and
poverty
and
remorse
and
revolt
the
german
people
received
us
humbly
they
were
eager
to
show
us
courtesy
and
submission
it
was
a
chance
for
our
young
junkers
for
the
prussian
in
the
hearts
of
young
pups
of
ours
who
could
play
the
petty
tyrant
shout
at
german
waiters
refuse
to
pay
their
bills
bully
shopkeepers
insult
unoffending
citizens
a
few
young
behaved
like
that
disgustingly
the
officers
of
fighting
battalions
and
the
men
were
very
different
it
was
a
strange
study
in
psychology
to
watch
them
here
they
were
among
the
the
men
they
passed
in
the
streets
and
sat
with
in
the
restaurants
had
been
in
german
uniforms
a
few
weeks
before
or
a
few
days
they
were
the
enemy
the
men
they
had
tried
to
kill
the
men
who
had
tried
to
kill
them
they
had
actually
fought
against
them
in
the
same
places
at
the
domhof
hotel
i
overheard
a
conversation
between
a
young
waiter
and
three
of
our
cavalry
officers
they
had
been
in
the
same
fight
in
the
village
of
noyelles
near
cambrai
a
tiny
place
of
ruin
where
they
had
crouched
under
fire
the
waiter
drew
a
diagram
on
the
i
was
just
the
three
cavalry
officers
laughed
extraordinary
we
were
a
few
yards
they
chatted
with
the
waiter
as
though
he
were
an
old
acquaintance
who
had
played
against
them
in
a
famous
they
did
not
try
to
kill
him
with
a
he
did
not
put
poison
in
the
soup
that
young
waiter
had
served
in
a
hotel
in
manchester
where
he
had
served
a
friend
of
mine
to
whom
he
now
expressed
his
opinion
on
the
folly
of
the
war
and
the
criminality
of
his
war
lords
and
things
in
general
among
these
last
he
uttered
an
epigram
which
i
remember
for
its
brutal
simplicity
it
was
when
a
of
ours
rather
the
worse
for
wine
had
been
making
a
scene
with
the
head
waiter
bullying
him
in
a
strident
voice
some
english
gentlemen
are
swine
said
the
young
waiter
but
all
german
gentlemen
are
some
of
our
officers
and
men
billeted
in
houses
outside
cologne
or
across
the
rhine
endeavored
to
stand
on
distant
terms
with
the
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
discourteous
when
the
old
lady
of
the
house
brought
them
an
early
cup
of
coffee
before
breakfast
warmed
their
boots
before
the
kitchen
fire
said
god
be
praised
the
war
is
for
english
soldiers
anything
like
hostility
was
ridiculous
in
the
presence
of
german
boys
and
girls
who
swarmed
round
their
horses
and
guns
kissed
their
hands
brought
them
little
pictures
and
gifts
kids
are
kids
said
a
i
do
want
to
cut
their
throats
queer
ai
it
many
of
the
kids
looked
half
starved
our
men
gave
them
bread
and
biscuit
and
bully
beef
in
cologne
the
people
seemed
pleased
to
see
british
soldiers
there
was
no
sense
of
humiliation
no
agony
of
grief
at
this
foreign
occupation
was
it
lack
of
pride
cringing
or
a
profound
relief
that
the
river
of
blood
had
ceased
to
flow
and
even
a
sense
of
protection
against
the
revolutionary
mob
which
had
looted
their
houses
before
our
entry
almost
every
family
had
lost
one
son
some
of
them
two
three
even
five
sons
in
that
orgy
of
slaughter
they
had
paid
a
dreadful
price
for
pride
their
ambition
had
been
drowned
in
blood
in
the
restaurants
orchestras
played
gay
music
once
i
heard
them
playing
old
english
melodies
and
i
sickened
a
little
at
that
that
was
going
too
far
i
looked
round
the
cafe
bauer
a
strange
scene
after
four
and
a
half
years
english
soldiers
were
chatting
with
germans
clinking
beer
mugs
with
them
the
germans
lifted
their
hats
to
english
tommies
our
men
canadian
and
english
said
cheerio
to
german
soldiers
in
uniforms
without
or
buttons
english
people
still
talking
of
huns
demanding
vengeance
the
maintenance
of
the
blockade
would
have
become
hysterical
if
they
had
come
suddenly
to
this
german
cafe
before
the
signing
of
peace
long
before
peace
was
signed
at
versailles
it
had
been
made
on
the
rhine
stronger
than
the
hate
of
war
was
human
nature
face
to
face
british
soldiers
found
that
every
german
had
two
eyes
a
nose
and
a
mouth
in
spite
of
being
a
as
ecclesiastics
would
say
when
not
roused
to
patriotic
fury
they
had
been
made
in
the
image
of
there
were
women
in
the
shops
and
in
the
farmhouses
girls
with
flaxen
pigtails
courtesied
very
prettily
to
english
officers
they
were
clean
their
houses
were
clean
more
spotless
even
than
english
homes
when
soldiers
turned
on
a
tap
they
found
water
came
out
of
it
wonderful
the
sanitary
arrangements
were
good
servants
were
hard
working
and
dutiful
there
was
something
after
all
in
german
kultur
at
night
the
children
said
their
prayer
to
the
christian
god
most
of
them
were
catholics
and
very
pious
they
seem
good
people
said
english
soldiers
at
night
in
the
streets
of
cologne
were
women
not
so
good
shameless
women
though
daintily
dressed
and
comely
british
soldiers
english
scottish
and
canadian
grinned
back
at
their
laughing
eyes
entered
into
converse
with
them
found
they
could
all
speak
english
went
down
with
them
to
houses
there
were
squalid
scenes
when
the
raided
these
houses
and
broke
up
an
entente
cordiale
that
was
flagrant
and
scandalous
astonishing
climax
to
the
drama
of
war
no
general
orders
could
stop
fraternization
before
peace
was
signed
human
nature
asserted
itself
against
all
artificial
restrictions
and
false
passion
friends
of
mine
who
had
been
violent
in
their
hatred
of
all
germans
became
thoughtful
and
said
of
course
there
are
exceptions
and
the
innocent
must
not
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
we
can
afford
to
be
a
little
generous
but
the
innocent
were
made
to
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
we
were
not
generous
we
maintained
the
blockade
and
german
children
starved
and
german
mothers
weakened
and
german
girls
swooned
in
the
and
german
babies
died
ludendorff
did
not
starve
or
die
neither
did
hindenburg
nor
any
german
war
lord
nor
any
profiteer
down
the
streets
of
cologne
came
people
of
the
rich
middle
classes
who
gorged
themselves
on
buns
and
cakes
for
afternoon
tea
they
were
cakes
of
ersatz
flour
with
ersatz
cream
and
not
very
healthy
or
nutritious
though
very
expensive
but
in
the
among
the
working
women
there
was
as
i
found
the
wolf
of
hunger
standing
with
open
jaws
by
every
doorway
it
was
not
actual
starvation
but
what
the
germans
call
unternahrung
producing
rickety
children
consumptive
girls
and
men
out
of
whom
vitality
had
gone
they
stinted
and
scraped
on
miserable
substitutes
and
never
had
enough
to
eat
yet
they
were
the
people
who
for
two
years
at
least
had
denounced
the
war
had
sent
up
petitions
for
peace
and
had
written
to
their
men
in
the
trenches
about
the
great
swindle
and
the
gilded
ones
they
were
powerless
as
some
of
them
told
me
because
of
the
secret
police
and
martial
law
what
could
they
do
against
the
government
with
all
their
men
away
at
the
front
they
were
treated
like
pigs
like
dirt
they
could
only
suffer
and
pray
they
had
a
little
hope
that
in
the
future
if
france
and
england
were
not
too
hard
they
might
pay
back
for
the
guilt
of
their
war
lords
and
see
a
new
germany
arise
out
of
its
ruin
freed
from
militarism
and
with
greater
liberties
so
humble
people
talked
to
us
when
i
went
among
them
with
a
friend
who
spoke
good
german
better
than
my
elementary
knowledge
i
believed
in
their
sincerity
which
had
come
through
suffering
though
i
believed
that
newspaper
editors
many
people
in
the
official
classes
and
the
old
military
caste
were
still
implacable
in
hatred
and
unrepentant
the
german
people
deserved
punishment
for
their
share
in
the
guilt
of
war
they
had
been
punished
by
frightful
losses
of
life
by
a
multitude
of
cripples
by
the
ruin
of
their
empire
when
they
told
me
of
their
hunger
i
could
not
forget
the
hungry
wives
and
children
of
france
and
belgium
who
had
been
captives
in
their
own
land
behind
german
lines
nor
our
prisoners
who
had
been
starved
until
many
of
them
died
when
i
walked
through
german
villages
and
pitied
the
women
who
yearned
for
their
men
still
prisoners
in
our
hands
nearly
a
year
after
the
armistice
and
long
after
peace
a
cruelty
which
shamed
us
i
think
i
remembered
hundreds
of
french
villages
broken
into
dust
by
german
burned
by
incendiary
shells
and
that
vast
desert
of
the
battlefields
in
france
and
belgium
which
never
in
our
time
will
regain
its
life
as
a
place
of
human
habitation
when
germans
said
our
industry
is
ruined
our
trade
is
killed
i
thought
of
the
factories
in
lille
and
many
towns
from
which
all
machinery
had
been
taken
or
in
which
all
machinery
had
been
broken
i
thought
of
the
thousand
crimes
of
their
war
the
agony
of
millions
of
people
upon
whose
liberties
they
had
trampled
and
upon
whose
necks
they
had
imposed
a
brutal
yoke
yet
even
with
all
those
memories
of
tragic
scenes
which
in
this
book
are
but
lightly
sketched
i
hoped
that
the
peace
we
should
impose
would
not
be
one
of
vengeance
by
which
the
innocent
would
pay
for
the
sins
of
the
guilty
the
children
for
their
fathers
lust
the
women
for
their
war
lords
the
soldiers
who
hated
war
for
those
who
drove
them
to
the
shambles
but
that
this
peace
should
in
justice
and
mercy
lead
the
of
europe
out
of
the
misery
in
which
all
were
plunged
and
by
a
policy
no
higher
than
common
sense
but
as
high
as
that
establish
a
new
phase
of
civilization
in
which
military
force
would
be
reduced
to
the
limits
of
safety
for
european
peoples
eager
to
end
the
folly
of
war
and
get
back
to
work
i
hoped
too
much
there
was
no
such
peace
part
eight
for
what
men
died
i
in
this
book
i
have
written
in
a
blunt
way
some
episodes
of
the
war
as
i
observed
them
and
gained
knowledge
of
them
in
their
daily
traffic
i
have
not
painted
the
picture
blacker
than
it
was
nor
selected
gruesome
morsels
and
joined
them
together
to
make
a
puzzle
for
ghoulish
delight
unlike
henri
barbusse
who
in
his
dreadful
book
le
feu
gave
the
unrelieved
blackness
of
this
human
drama
i
have
here
and
in
other
books
shown
the
light
as
well
as
the
shade
in
which
our
men
lived
the
gaiety
as
well
as
the
fear
they
had
the
exultation
as
well
as
the
agony
of
battle
the
spiritual
ardor
of
boys
as
well
as
the
brutality
of
the
task
that
was
theirs
i
have
tried
to
set
down
as
many
aspects
of
the
war
psychology
as
i
could
find
in
my
remembrance
of
these
years
without
exaggeration
or
false
emphasis
so
that
out
of
their
confusion
even
out
of
their
contradiction
the
real
truth
of
the
adventure
might
be
seen
as
it
touched
the
souls
of
men
yet
when
one
strives
to
sum
up
the
evidence
and
reach
definite
conclusions
about
the
motives
which
led
men
of
the
warring
nations
to
kill
one
another
year
after
year
in
those
fields
of
slaughter
the
ideals
for
which
so
many
millions
of
men
laid
down
their
lives
and
the
effect
of
those
years
of
carnage
upon
the
philosophy
of
this
present
world
of
men
there
is
no
clear
line
of
thought
or
conviction
it
is
difficult
at
least
to
forecast
the
changes
that
will
be
produced
by
this
experience
in
the
social
structure
of
civilized
peoples
and
in
their
relations
to
one
another
though
it
is
certain
even
now
that
out
of
the
passion
of
the
war
a
new
era
in
the
world
history
is
being
born
the
ideas
of
vast
masses
of
people
have
been
revolutionized
by
the
thoughts
that
were
stirred
up
in
them
during
those
years
of
intense
suffering
no
system
of
government
designed
by
men
afraid
of
the
new
ideas
will
have
power
to
kill
them
though
they
may
throttle
them
for
a
time
for
good
or
ill
i
know
not
which
the
ideas
germinated
in
trenches
and
dugouts
in
towns
under
shell
fire
or
in
hearts
stricken
by
personal
tragedy
or
will
prevail
over
the
old
order
which
dominated
the
nations
of
europe
and
the
old
philosophy
of
political
and
social
governance
will
be
challenged
and
perhaps
overthrown
if
the
new
ideas
are
thwarted
by
reactionary
rulers
endeavoring
to
jerk
the
world
back
to
its
discipline
under
their
authority
there
will
be
anarchy
reaching
to
the
heights
of
terror
in
more
countries
than
those
where
anarchy
now
prevails
if
by
fear
or
by
wisdom
the
new
ideas
are
allowed
to
gain
their
ground
gradually
a
revolution
will
be
accomplished
without
anarchy
but
in
any
case
for
good
or
ill
a
revolution
will
happen
it
has
happened
in
the
sense
that
already
there
is
no
resemblance
between
this
europe
and
that
in
the
mental
attitude
of
the
masses
toward
the
problems
of
life
in
every
country
there
are
individuals
men
and
women
who
are
going
about
as
though
what
had
happened
had
made
no
difference
and
as
though
after
a
period
of
restlessness
the
people
will
settle
down
to
the
old
style
of
things
they
are
merely
there
are
others
who
see
clearly
enough
that
they
can
not
govern
or
dupe
the
people
with
old
and
they
are
struggling
desperately
to
think
out
new
words
which
may
help
them
to
regain
their
power
over
simple
minds
the
old
gangs
are
organizing
a
new
system
of
defense
building
a
new
kind
of
hindenburg
line
behind
which
they
are
dumping
their
political
ammunition
but
their
hindenburg
line
is
not
impregnable
the
angry
murmur
of
the
mob
highly
organized
disciplined
passionate
trained
to
fight
is
already
approaching
the
outer
bastions
in
russia
the
mob
is
in
possession
wiping
the
blood
out
of
their
eyes
after
the
nightmare
of
anarchy
encompassed
by
forces
of
the
old
regime
and
not
knowing
yet
whether
its
victory
is
won
or
how
to
shape
the
new
order
that
must
follow
chaos
in
germany
there
is
only
the
psychology
of
stunned
people
broken
for
a
time
in
body
and
spirit
after
stupendous
efforts
and
bloody
losses
which
led
to
ruin
and
the
complete
destruction
of
their
old
pride
philosophy
and
power
the
revolution
that
has
happened
there
is
strange
and
rather
pitiful
it
was
not
caused
by
the
will
power
of
the
people
but
by
a
cessation
of
they
did
not
overthrow
their
ruling
dynasty
their
tyrants
the
tyrants
fled
and
the
people
were
not
angry
nor
sorry
nor
fierce
nor
glad
they
were
stupefied
members
of
the
old
order
joined
hands
with
those
of
the
people
parties
out
to
evolve
a
republic
with
new
ideals
based
upon
the
people
will
and
inspired
by
the
people
passion
the
germans
after
the
armistice
and
after
the
peace
had
no
passion
as
they
had
no
will
they
were
in
a
state
of
coma
the
blow
had
happened
to
them
and
they
were
incapable
of
action
they
just
ceased
from
action
they
had
been
betrayed
to
this
ruin
by
their
military
and
political
rulers
but
they
had
not
vitality
enough
to
demand
vengeance
on
those
men
the
extent
of
their
ruin
was
so
great
that
it
annihilated
anger
political
passion
pride
all
emotion
except
that
of
despair
how
could
they
save
something
out
of
the
remnants
of
the
power
that
had
been
theirs
how
could
they
keep
alive
feed
their
women
and
children
pay
their
monstrous
debts
they
had
lost
their
faith
as
well
as
their
war
nothing
that
they
had
believed
was
true
they
had
believed
in
their
invincible
armies
and
the
armies
had
bled
to
death
and
broken
they
had
believed
in
the
supreme
military
genius
of
their
war
lords
and
the
war
lords
blunderers
as
well
as
criminals
had
led
them
to
the
abyss
and
dropped
them
over
they
had
believed
in
the
divine
mission
of
the
german
people
as
a
civilizing
force
and
now
they
were
despised
by
all
other
peoples
as
a
brutal
and
barbarous
race
in
spite
of
german
music
german
german
art
german
sentiment
they
had
been
abandoned
by
god
by
the
protecting
hand
of
the
altes
gutes
deutsches
gottes
to
whom
many
had
prayed
for
comfort
and
help
in
those
years
of
war
in
protestant
churches
and
catholic
churches
with
deep
piety
and
childlike
faith
what
sins
had
they
done
that
they
should
be
abandoned
by
god
the
invasion
of
belgium
that
they
argued
was
a
tragic
necessity
atrocities
those
were
they
believed
the
inventions
of
their
enemies
there
had
been
stern
things
done
terrible
things
but
according
to
the
laws
of
war
had
been
shot
that
was
war
hostages
had
been
shot
it
was
to
save
german
lives
from
slaughter
by
civilians
individual
brutalities
yes
there
were
brutes
in
all
armies
the
war
it
was
said
the
german
patriot
to
break
a
blockade
that
was
starving
millions
of
german
children
to
slow
death
condemning
millions
to
consumption
rickets
all
manner
of
disease
nurse
cavell
she
pleaded
guilty
to
a
crime
that
was
punishable
as
she
knew
by
death
she
was
a
brave
woman
who
took
her
risk
and
was
judged
according
to
the
justice
of
war
which
is
very
cruel
why
not
said
german
soldiers
when
to
be
gassed
was
less
terrible
than
to
be
blown
to
bits
by
high
explosives
they
had
been
the
first
to
use
that
new
method
of
destruction
as
the
english
were
the
first
to
use
tanks
terrible
also
in
their
destructiveness
germany
was
guilty
of
this
war
had
provoked
it
against
peaceful
peoples
no
a
thousand
times
no
they
had
been
said
the
troubled
soul
of
germany
encompassed
with
enemies
they
had
plotted
to
close
her
in
russia
was
a
huge
menace
france
had
entered
into
alliance
with
russia
and
was
waiting
her
chance
to
grab
at
italy
was
ready
for
betrayal
england
hated
the
power
of
germany
and
was
in
secret
alliance
with
france
and
russia
germany
had
struck
to
save
herself
it
was
a
war
of
to
save
the
the
german
people
still
clung
desperately
to
those
ideas
after
the
armistice
as
i
found
in
cologne
and
other
towns
and
as
friends
of
mine
who
had
visited
berlin
told
me
after
peace
was
signed
the
germans
refused
to
believe
in
accusations
of
atrocity
they
knew
that
some
of
these
stories
had
been
faked
by
hostile
propaganda
and
knowing
that
as
we
know
they
thought
all
were
false
they
said
and
made
counter
charges
against
the
russians
and
poles
they
could
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
that
their
sons
and
brothers
had
been
more
brutal
than
the
laws
of
war
allow
and
what
brutality
they
had
done
was
imposed
upon
them
by
ruthless
discipline
but
they
deplored
the
war
and
the
common
people
and
civilians
cursed
the
rich
and
governing
classes
who
had
made
profit
out
of
it
and
had
continued
it
when
they
might
have
made
peace
with
honor
that
was
their
accusation
against
their
leaders
that
and
the
ruthless
bloody
way
in
which
their
men
had
been
hurled
into
the
furnace
on
a
gambler
chance
of
victory
while
they
were
duped
by
faked
promises
of
victory
when
not
put
upon
their
defense
by
accusations
against
the
whole
fatherland
the
german
people
as
far
as
i
could
tell
by
talking
with
a
few
of
them
and
by
those
letters
which
fell
into
our
hands
revolted
in
spirit
against
the
monstrous
futility
and
idiocy
of
the
war
and
were
convinced
in
their
souls
that
its
origin
lay
in
the
greed
and
pride
of
the
governing
classes
of
all
nations
who
had
used
men
bodies
as
counters
in
a
devil
game
that
view
was
expressed
in
the
signboards
put
above
the
parapet
we
all
fools
let
all
go
home
and
in
that
letter
by
the
woman
who
wrote
for
the
poor
here
it
is
terrible
and
yet
the
rich
the
gilded
ones
the
bloated
aristocrats
gobble
up
everything
in
front
of
our
very
eyes
all
soldiers
friend
and
foe
ought
to
throw
down
their
weapons
and
go
on
strike
so
that
this
war
which
enslaves
the
people
more
than
ever
may
it
is
that
view
terrible
in
its
simplicity
which
may
cause
a
more
passionate
revolution
in
germany
when
the
people
awaken
from
their
stupor
it
was
that
view
which
led
to
the
russian
revolution
and
to
bolshevism
it
is
the
suspicion
which
is
creeping
into
the
brains
of
british
and
making
them
threaten
to
strike
against
any
adventure
of
war
like
that
in
russia
which
seems
to
them
unless
proved
otherwise
on
behalf
of
the
gilded
ones
and
for
the
enslavement
of
the
peoples
not
to
face
that
truth
is
to
deny
the
passionate
convictions
of
masses
of
men
in
europe
that
is
one
key
to
the
heart
of
the
revolutionary
movement
which
is
surging
beneath
the
surface
of
our
european
state
it
is
a
the
belief
of
many
brooding
minds
that
almost
as
great
as
the
direct
guilt
of
the
german
war
lords
was
the
guilt
of
the
whole
political
society
of
europe
whose
secret
diplomacy
unrevealed
to
the
peoples
was
based
upon
hatred
and
fear
and
rivalry
in
play
for
imperial
power
and
the
world
markets
as
common
folk
play
dominoes
for
penny
points
and
risking
the
lives
of
common
folk
in
a
gamble
for
enormous
stakes
of
territory
imperial
prestige
the
personal
vanity
of
politicians
the
vast
private
gain
of
trusts
and
profiteers
to
keep
the
living
counters
quiet
to
make
them
jump
into
the
pool
of
their
own
free
will
at
the
word
go
the
statesmen
diplomats
trusts
and
profiteers
debauch
the
name
of
patriotism
raise
the
watchword
of
liberty
and
play
upon
the
ignorance
of
the
mob
easily
skillfully
by
inciting
them
to
race
hatred
by
inflaming
the
in
them
and
by
concocting
a
terrible
mixture
of
false
idealism
and
so
that
simple
minds
quick
to
respond
to
sentiment
as
well
as
those
quick
to
hear
the
call
of
the
beast
rally
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
march
to
the
battlegrounds
under
the
spell
of
that
potion
some
go
with
a
noble
sense
of
sacrifice
some
with
in
their
hearts
most
with
the
following
the
lead
little
knowing
that
they
are
but
the
pawns
of
a
game
which
is
being
played
behind
closed
doors
by
the
great
gamblers
in
the
courts
and
foreign
offices
and
and
of
the
political
casinos
in
europe
i
have
heard
the
expression
of
this
view
from
soldiers
during
the
war
and
since
the
war
at
in
and
in
conversations
with
railway
men
mechanics
policemen
and
others
who
were
soldiers
a
year
ago
or
thinking
hard
over
the
meaning
of
the
war
i
am
certain
that
millions
of
men
are
thinking
these
things
because
i
found
the
track
of
those
common
thoughts
crude
simple
dangerous
among
canadian
soldiers
crossing
the
atlantic
in
canadian
towns
and
in
the
united
states
as
i
had
begun
to
see
the
trail
of
them
far
back
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
when
i
moved
among
french
soldiers
belgian
soldiers
and
our
own
men
my
own
belief
is
not
so
simple
as
that
i
do
not
divorce
all
peoples
from
their
governments
as
victims
of
a
subtle
tyranny
devised
by
statesmen
and
diplomats
of
diabolical
cunning
and
by
financial
magnates
ready
to
exploit
human
life
for
greater
gains
i
see
the
evil
which
led
to
the
crime
of
the
war
and
to
the
crimes
of
the
peace
with
roots
to
the
very
foundation
of
human
society
the
fear
of
statesmen
upon
which
all
international
relations
were
based
was
in
the
hearts
of
peoples
france
was
afraid
of
germany
and
screwed
up
her
military
service
her
war
preparations
to
the
limit
of
national
endurance
the
majority
of
the
people
of
france
accepting
the
burden
as
inevitable
and
right
because
of
her
fear
of
germany
france
made
her
alliance
with
russian
czardom
her
entente
cordiale
with
imperial
england
and
the
french
people
poured
their
money
into
russian
loans
as
a
life
insurance
against
the
german
menace
french
statesmen
knew
that
their
diplomacy
was
supported
by
the
majority
of
the
people
by
their
ignorance
as
well
as
by
their
knowledge
so
it
was
in
germany
the
of
the
german
war
lords
expressed
the
popular
sentiment
of
the
german
people
which
was
largely
influenced
by
the
fear
of
russia
in
alliance
with
france
by
fear
and
envy
of
the
british
empire
and
england
and
by
the
faith
that
germany
must
break
through
that
hostile
combination
at
all
costs
in
order
to
fulfil
the
high
destiny
which
was
marked
out
for
her
as
she
thought
by
the
genius
and
industry
of
her
people
the
greed
of
the
bloated
aristocrats
was
only
on
a
bigger
scale
than
the
greed
of
the
small
shopkeepers
the
desire
to
capture
new
markets
belonged
not
only
to
statesmen
but
to
commercial
travelers
the
german
peasant
believed
as
much
in
the
might
of
the
german
armies
as
hindenburg
and
ludendorff
the
brutality
of
german
generals
was
not
worse
than
that
of
the
unteroffizier
or
the
foreman
of
works
in
england
there
was
no
traditional
hatred
of
germany
but
for
some
years
distrust
and
suspicions
which
had
been
vented
in
the
newspapers
with
taunts
and
challenges
stinging
the
pride
of
germans
and
playing
into
the
hands
of
the
junker
caste
our
war
psychology
was
different
from
that
of
our
allies
because
of
our
island
position
and
our
faith
in
seapower
which
had
made
us
immune
from
the
fear
of
invasion
it
took
some
time
to
awaken
the
people
to
a
sense
of
real
peril
and
of
personal
menace
to
their
hearths
and
homes
to
the
very
end
masses
of
english
folk
believed
that
we
were
fighting
for
the
rescue
of
other
peoples
belgian
french
serbian
rumanian
and
not
for
the
continuance
of
our
imperial
power
the
official
propaganda
the
words
and
actions
of
british
statesmen
did
actually
express
the
conscious
and
subconscious
psychology
of
the
multitude
the
call
to
the
old
watchwords
of
national
pride
and
imperial
might
thrilled
the
soul
of
a
people
of
proud
tradition
in
sea
battles
and
appeals
for
the
rescue
of
the
little
nations
struck
old
chords
of
chivalry
and
sentiment
though
with
a
strange
lack
of
logic
and
sincerity
irish
demand
for
was
unheeded
base
passions
as
well
as
noble
instincts
were
stirred
easily
greedy
was
the
appetite
of
the
mob
for
atrocity
tales
the
more
revolting
they
were
the
quicker
they
were
swallowed
the
foul
absurdity
of
the
was
not
rejected
any
more
than
the
tale
of
the
crucified
canadian
disproved
by
our
own
or
the
cutting
off
of
children
hands
and
women
breasts
for
which
i
could
find
no
evidence
from
the
only
british
ambulances
working
in
the
districts
where
such
horrors
were
reported
flourished
in
mean
streets
german
music
was
banned
in
english
preachers
and
professors
denied
any
quality
of
virtue
or
genius
to
german
poets
philosophers
scientists
or
scholars
a
critical
weighing
of
evidence
was
regarded
as
and
lack
of
patriotism
truth
was
delivered
bound
to
passion
hatred
at
home
inspired
largely
by
feminine
hysteria
and
official
propaganda
reached
such
heights
that
when
came
back
on
leave
their
refusal
to
say
much
against
their
enemy
their
straightforward
assertions
that
fritz
was
not
so
black
as
he
was
painted
that
he
fought
bravely
died
gamely
and
in
the
was
decent
industrious
were
heard
with
shocked
silence
by
mothers
and
sisters
who
could
only
excuse
this
absence
of
hate
on
the
score
of
ii
the
people
of
all
countries
were
deeply
involved
in
the
general
of
europe
they
made
no
passionate
appeal
in
the
name
of
christ
or
in
the
name
of
humanity
for
the
cessation
of
the
slaughter
of
boys
and
the
suicide
of
nations
and
for
a
reconciliation
of
peoples
upon
terms
of
some
more
reasonable
argument
than
that
of
high
explosives
peace
proposals
from
the
pope
from
germany
from
austria
were
rejected
with
fierce
denunciation
most
passionate
scorn
as
peace
plots
and
peace
traps
not
without
the
terrible
logic
of
the
vicious
circle
because
indeed
there
was
no
sincerity
of
renunciation
in
some
of
those
offers
of
peace
and
the
powers
hostile
to
us
were
simply
trying
our
strength
and
our
weakness
in
order
to
make
their
own
kind
of
peace
which
should
be
that
of
conquest
the
gamblers
playing
the
game
of
poker
with
crowns
and
armies
as
their
stakes
were
upheld
generally
by
the
peoples
who
would
not
abate
one
point
of
pride
one
fraction
of
hate
one
claim
of
vengeance
though
all
europe
should
fall
in
ruin
and
the
last
legions
of
boys
be
massacred
there
was
no
call
from
people
to
people
across
the
frontiers
of
hostility
let
us
end
this
homicidal
mania
let
us
get
back
to
sanity
and
save
our
younger
sons
let
us
hand
over
to
justice
those
who
will
continue
the
slaughter
of
our
youth
there
was
no
forgiveness
no
generous
instinct
no
common
sense
in
any
combatant
nation
of
europe
like
wolves
they
had
their
teeth
in
one
another
throats
and
would
not
let
go
though
all
bloody
and
exhausted
until
one
should
fall
at
the
last
gasp
to
be
mangled
by
the
others
yet
in
each
nation
even
in
germany
there
were
men
and
women
who
saw
the
folly
of
the
war
and
the
crime
of
it
and
desired
to
end
it
by
some
act
of
renunciation
and
repentance
and
by
some
uplifting
of
the
people
spirit
to
vault
the
frontiers
of
hatred
and
the
barbed
wire
which
hedged
in
patriotism
some
of
them
were
put
in
prison
most
of
them
saw
the
impossibility
of
counteracting
the
forces
of
insanity
which
had
made
the
world
mad
and
kept
silent
hiding
their
thoughts
and
brooding
over
them
the
leaders
of
the
nations
continued
to
use
as
their
argument
and
justification
excited
it
anew
when
its
fires
burned
low
focused
it
upon
definite
objectives
and
gave
it
a
sense
of
righteousness
by
the
watchwords
of
liberty
justice
honor
and
retribution
each
side
proclaimed
christ
as
its
captain
and
invoked
the
blessing
and
aid
of
the
god
of
christendom
though
germans
were
allied
with
turks
and
france
was
full
of
black
and
yellow
men
the
german
people
did
not
try
to
avert
their
ruin
by
denouncing
the
criminal
acts
of
their
war
lords
nor
by
deploring
the
cruelties
they
had
committed
the
allies
did
not
help
them
to
do
so
because
of
their
lust
for
bloody
vengeance
and
their
desire
for
the
spoils
of
victory
the
peoples
shared
the
blame
of
their
rulers
because
they
were
not
nobler
than
their
rulers
they
can
not
now
plead
ignorance
or
betrayal
by
false
ideals
which
duped
them
because
character
does
not
depend
on
knowledge
and
it
was
the
character
of
european
peoples
which
failed
in
the
crisis
of
the
world
fate
so
that
they
followed
the
of
the
beast
in
the
jungle
rather
than
the
voice
of
the
crucified
one
whom
they
pretended
to
adore
iii
the
character
of
european
peoples
failed
in
common
sense
and
in
christian
charity
it
did
not
fail
in
courage
to
endure
great
agonies
to
suffer
death
largely
to
be
obedient
to
the
old
tradition
of
patriotism
and
to
the
stoic
spirit
of
old
fighting
races
in
courage
i
do
not
think
there
was
much
difference
between
the
chief
combatants
the
germans
as
a
race
were
wonderfully
brave
until
their
spirit
was
broken
by
the
sure
knowledge
of
defeat
and
by
lack
of
food
many
times
through
all
those
years
they
marched
shoulder
to
shoulder
obedient
to
discipline
to
certain
death
as
i
saw
them
on
the
somme
like
martyrs
they
marched
for
their
fatherland
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
the
german
race
as
it
had
entered
their
souls
by
the
memory
of
old
german
songs
old
heroic
ballads
their
german
home
life
their
german
women
their
love
of
little
old
towns
on
hillsides
or
in
valleys
by
all
the
meaning
to
them
of
that
word
germany
which
is
like
the
name
of
england
to
us
who
is
fool
enough
to
think
otherwise
and
fought
often
a
thousand
times
to
the
death
as
i
saw
their
bodies
heaped
in
the
fields
of
the
somme
and
round
their
in
flanders
and
in
the
last
phase
of
the
war
behind
the
hindenburg
line
round
their
broken
batteries
on
the
way
of
mons
and
le
cateau
the
german
people
endured
years
of
and
a
drain
of
blood
greater
than
any
other
fighting
people
two
million
dead
before
they
lost
all
vitality
hope
and
pride
and
made
their
abject
surrender
at
the
beginning
they
were
out
for
conquest
inspired
by
arrogance
and
pride
before
the
end
they
fought
desperately
to
defend
the
fatherland
from
the
doom
which
cast
its
black
shadow
on
them
as
it
drew
near
they
were
brave
those
germans
whatever
the
brutality
of
individual
men
and
the
cruelty
of
their
commanders
the
courage
of
france
is
to
me
like
an
old
heroic
song
stirring
the
heart
it
was
medieval
in
its
complete
adherence
to
the
faith
of
valor
and
its
spirit
of
sacrifice
for
la
patrie
if
patriotism
were
enough
as
the
gospel
of
life
nurse
cavell
did
not
think
so
france
as
a
nation
was
perfect
in
that
faith
her
people
had
no
doubt
as
to
their
duty
it
was
to
defend
their
sacred
soil
from
the
enemy
which
had
invaded
it
it
was
to
hurl
the
brutes
back
from
the
fair
fields
they
had
ravaged
and
despoiled
it
was
to
liberate
their
brothers
and
sisters
from
the
outrageous
tyranny
of
the
german
yoke
in
the
captured
country
it
was
to
seek
vengeance
for
bloody
foul
and
abominable
deeds
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
france
was
struck
by
heavy
blows
which
sent
her
armies
reeling
back
in
retreat
but
before
the
first
battle
of
the
marne
when
her
peril
was
greatest
when
paris
seemed
doomed
the
spirit
of
the
french
soldiers
rose
to
a
supreme
act
of
faith
which
was
fulfilled
when
foch
attacked
in
the
center
when
manoury
struck
on
the
enemy
flank
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
young
frenchmen
hurled
themselves
reckless
of
life
upon
the
monster
which
faltered
and
then
fled
behind
the
shelter
of
the
aisne
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
parched
throats
and
swollen
tongues
blind
with
sweat
and
blood
mad
with
the
heat
and
fury
of
attack
the
french
soldiers
fought
through
that
first
battle
of
the
marne
and
saved
france
from
defeat
and
despair
after
that
year
after
year
they
flung
themselves
against
the
german
defense
and
died
in
heaps
or
held
their
lines
as
at
verdun
against
colossal
onslaught
until
the
dead
lay
in
masses
but
the
living
said
they
shall
not
pass
and
kept
their
word
the
people
of
france
above
all
the
women
of
france
behind
the
lines
were
the
equals
of
the
in
valor
they
fought
with
despair
through
many
black
months
and
did
not
yield
they
did
the
work
of
their
men
in
the
fields
and
knew
that
many
of
them
the
sons
or
brothers
or
lovers
or
husbands
would
never
return
for
the
but
did
not
cry
to
have
them
back
until
the
enemy
should
be
thrust
out
of
france
behind
the
german
line
under
german
rule
the
french
people
prisoners
in
their
own
land
suffered
most
in
spirit
but
were
proud
and
patient
in
endurance
why
do
your
people
give
in
asked
a
german
officer
of
a
woman
in
nesle
france
is
bleeding
to
we
shall
go
on
for
two
years
or
three
years
or
four
or
five
and
in
the
end
we
shall
smash
you
said
the
woman
who
told
me
this
the
german
officer
stared
at
her
and
said
you
people
are
wonderful
yes
they
were
wonderful
the
french
and
their
hatred
of
the
germans
their
desire
for
vengeance
complete
and
terrible
at
all
cost
of
life
even
though
france
should
bleed
to
death
and
die
after
victory
is
to
be
understood
in
the
heights
and
depths
of
its
hatred
and
in
the
passion
of
its
love
for
france
and
liberty
when
i
think
of
france
i
am
tempted
to
see
no
greater
thing
than
such
patriotism
as
that
to
justify
the
gospel
of
hate
against
such
an
enemy
to
uphold
vengeance
as
a
sweet
virtue
yet
if
i
did
so
i
should
deny
the
truth
that
has
been
revealed
to
many
men
and
women
by
the
agony
of
the
war
that
if
civilization
may
continue
patriotism
is
not
enough
that
international
hatred
will
produce
other
wars
worse
than
this
in
which
civilization
will
be
submerged
and
that
vengeance
even
for
dreadful
crimes
can
not
be
taken
of
a
nation
without
punishing
the
innocent
more
than
the
guilty
so
that
out
of
its
cruelty
and
injustice
new
fires
of
hatred
are
lighted
the
demand
for
vengeance
passes
to
the
other
side
and
the
devil
finds
another
vicious
circle
in
which
to
trap
the
souls
of
men
and
catch
all
alive
o
to
deny
that
would
also
be
a
denial
of
the
faith
with
which
millions
of
young
frenchmen
rushed
to
the
colors
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
it
was
they
who
said
this
is
a
war
to
end
they
told
me
so
it
was
they
who
said
german
militarism
must
be
killed
so
that
all
militarism
shall
be
abolished
this
is
a
war
for
so
soldiers
of
france
spoke
to
me
on
a
night
when
paris
was
mobilized
and
the
tragedy
began
it
is
a
frenchman
henri
barbusse
who
in
spite
of
the
german
invasion
the
outrages
against
his
people
the
agony
of
france
has
the
courage
to
say
that
all
peoples
in
europe
were
involved
in
the
guilt
of
that
war
because
of
their
adherence
to
that
old
barbaric
creed
of
brute
force
and
the
superstitious
servitude
of
their
souls
to
symbols
of
national
pride
based
upon
military
tradition
he
even
denounces
the
salute
to
the
flag
instinctive
and
sacred
in
the
heart
of
every
frenchman
as
a
fetish
worship
in
which
the
narrow
bigotry
of
national
arrogance
is
raised
above
the
rights
of
the
common
masses
of
men
he
draws
no
distinction
between
a
war
of
defense
and
a
war
of
aggression
because
attack
is
the
best
means
of
defense
and
all
peoples
who
go
to
war
dupe
themselves
into
the
belief
that
they
do
so
in
defense
of
their
liberties
and
rights
and
power
and
property
germany
attacked
france
first
because
she
was
ready
first
and
sure
of
her
strength
france
would
have
attacked
germany
first
to
get
back
to
wipe
out
if
she
also
had
been
ready
and
sure
of
her
strength
the
political
philosophy
on
both
sides
of
the
rhine
was
the
same
it
was
based
on
military
power
and
rivalry
of
secret
alliances
and
imperial
ambitions
the
internationalism
of
jean
jaures
who
with
all
his
limitations
was
a
great
frenchman
patriot
and
idealist
had
failed
among
his
own
people
and
in
germany
and
the
assassin
bullet
was
his
reward
for
the
adventure
of
his
soul
to
lift
civilization
above
the
level
of
the
old
jungle
law
and
to
save
france
from
the
massacre
which
happened
in
war
france
was
wonderful
most
heroic
in
sacrifice
most
splendid
in
valor
in
her
dictated
peace
which
was
ours
also
her
leaders
were
betrayed
by
the
very
evil
which
millions
of
young
frenchmen
had
gone
out
to
kill
at
the
sacrifice
of
their
own
lives
militarism
was
exalted
in
france
above
the
ruins
of
german
militarism
it
was
a
peace
of
vengeance
which
punished
the
innocent
more
than
the
guilty
the
babe
at
the
breast
more
than
the
junker
in
his
schloss
the
poor
more
than
the
war
lord
the
peasant
who
had
been
driven
to
the
shambles
more
than
sixt
von
arnim
or
rupprecht
of
bavaria
or
ludendorff
or
hindenburg
it
is
a
peace
that
can
only
be
maintained
by
the
power
of
artillery
and
by
the
conscription
of
every
french
boy
who
shall
be
trained
for
the
next
war
of
defense
twenty
years
hence
thirty
years
hence
when
germany
is
strong
again
stronger
than
france
because
of
her
population
stronger
then
enormously
than
france
in
relative
numbers
of
men
than
in
august
so
if
that
philosophy
continue
and
i
do
not
think
it
will
the
old
fear
will
be
the
old
burdens
of
armament
will
be
piled
up
anew
the
people
of
france
will
be
weighed
down
as
before
under
a
military
regime
stifling
their
liberty
of
thought
and
action
wasting
the
best
years
of
their
boyhood
in
barracks
seeking
protective
alliances
buying
allies
at
great
cost
establishing
the
old
spy
system
the
old
diplomacy
the
old
squalid
ways
of
inter
national
politics
based
as
before
on
fear
and
force
marshal
foch
was
a
fine
soldier
clemenceau
was
a
strong
minister
of
war
there
was
no
man
great
enough
in
france
to
see
beyond
the
passing
triumph
of
military
victory
and
by
supreme
generosity
of
soul
to
lift
their
enemy
out
of
the
dirt
of
their
despair
so
that
the
new
german
republic
should
arise
from
the
ruins
of
the
empire
remorseful
of
their
deeds
in
france
and
belgium
with
all
their
rage
directed
against
their
ancient
tyranny
and
with
a
spirit
of
democratic
liberty
reaching
across
the
old
frontiers
is
that
the
foolish
dream
of
the
sentimentalist
no
more
than
that
for
the
german
people
after
their
agony
were
ready
to
respond
to
generous
dealing
pitiful
in
their
need
of
it
and
there
is
enough
sentiment
in
german
hearts
the
most
sentimental
people
in
europe
to
rise
with
a
surge
of
emotion
to
a
new
gospel
of
atonement
if
their
old
enemies
had
offered
a
chance
of
grace
france
has
not
won
the
war
by
her
terms
of
peace
nor
safeguarded
her
frontiers
for
more
than
a
few
uncertain
years
by
harking
back
to
the
old
philosophy
of
militarism
she
has
peril
amid
a
people
drained
of
blood
and
deeply
in
debt
her
support
of
reactionary
forces
in
russia
is
to
establish
a
government
which
will
guarantee
the
interest
on
french
loans
and
organize
a
new
military
regime
in
alliance
with
france
and
england
meanwhile
france
looks
to
the
united
states
and
british
people
to
protect
her
from
the
next
war
when
germany
shall
be
strong
again
she
is
playing
the
militarist
role

the
strength

sustain
it

brutal
fellows
in

as
in
all
crowds
of
men
in
millions
of
words
during
the
years
of

i
recorded
the
bravery
of
our
troops
on
the
western
front
their
patience
their
cheerfulness
suffering
and
agony
yet
with
all
those
words
describing
day
by
day
the
incidents
of
their
life
in
war
i
did
not
exaggerate
the
splendor
of
their
stoic
spirit
or
the
measure
of
their
sacrifice
the
heroes
of
mythology
were
but
paltry
figures
compared
with
those
who
in
the
great
war
went
forward
to
the
roaring
devils
of

dwelt
amid

explosives
more
dreadful
than

breathed

fumes
of
more
foul
than
the
breath
of

watched
and
slept
above
which
upheaved
the
of
pluto
and
defied
thunderbolts
more
certain
in
blows
than
those
of
jove
something
there
was
in
the
spirit
of
our
men
which
led
them
to
endure
these
things
without
revolt
ideals
higher
than
the
selfish
motives
of
life
they
did
not
fight
for
greed
or
glory
not
for
conquest
nor
for
vengeance
hatred
was
not
the
inspiration
of
the
mass
of
them
for
i
am
certain
that
except
in
hours
when
men
see
red
there
was
no
direct
hatred
of
the
men
in
the
opposite
trenches
but
on
the
other
hand
a
queer
sense
of
fellow
feeling
a
humorous
sympathy
for
old
fritz
who
was
in
the
same
bloody
mess
as
themselves
our
generals
it
is
true
hated
the
germans
i
should
like
one
week
in
cologne
one
of
them
told
me
before
there
seemed
ever
a
chance
of
getting
there
and
i
would
let
my
men
loose
in
the
streets
and
turn
a
blind
eye
to
anything
they
liked
to
some
of
our
officers
were
inspired
by
a
bitter
unrelenting
hate
if
i
had
a
thousand
germans
in
a
row
one
of
them
said
to
me
i
would
cut
all
their
throats
and
enjoy
the
but
that
was
not
the
mentality
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
except
those
who
were
murderers
by
nature
and
pleasure
they
gave
their
cigarettes
to
prisoners
and
filled
their
and
chatted
in
a
friendly
way
with
any
german
who
spoke
a
little
english
as
i
have
seen
them
time
and
time
again
on
days
of
battle
in
the
fields
of
battle
there
were
exceptions
to
this
treatment
but
even
the
australians
and
the
scots
who
were
most
fierce
in
battle
giving
no
quarter
sometimes
treated
their
prisoners
with
humanity
when
they
were
bundled
back
hatred
was
not
the
motive
which
made
our
men
endure
all
things
it
was
rather
as
i
have
said
a
refusal
in
their
souls
to
be
beaten
in
manhood
by
all
the
devils
of
war
by
all
its
terrors
or
by
its
beastliness
and
at
the
back
of
all
the
thought
that
the
old
country
was
up
against
it
and
that
they
were
there
to
avert
the
evil
young
soldiers
of
ours
not
only
of
officer
rank
but
of
other
ranks
as
they
were
called
were
inspired
at
the
beginning
and
some
of
them
to
the
end
with
a
simple
boyish
idealism
they
saw
no
other
causes
of
war
than
german
brutality
the
enemy
to
them
was
the
monster
who
had
to
be
destroyed
lest
the
world
and
its
beauty
should
perish
and
that
was
true
so
long
as
the
individual
german
who
loathed
the
war
obeyed
the
discipline
of
the
and
did
not
revolt
against
the
natural
laws
which
when
the
war
had
once
started
bade
him
die
in
defense
of
his
own
fatherland
many
of
those
boys
of
ours
made
a
dedication
of
their
lives
upon
the
altar
of
sacrifice
believing
that
by
this
service
and
this
sacrifice
they
would
help
the
victory
of
civilization
over
barbarism
and
of
christian
morality
over
the
devil
law
they
believed
that
they
were
fighting
to
dethrone
militarism
to
insure
the
happiness
and
liberties
of
civilized
peoples
and
were
sure
of
the
gratitude
of
their
nation
should
they
not
have
the
fate
to
fall
upon
the
field
of
honor
but
go
home
blind
or
helpless
i
have
read
many
letters
from
boys
now
dead
in
which
they
express
that
faith
do
not
grieve
for
me
wrote
one
of
them
for
i
shall
be
proud
to
die
for
my
country
i
am
happy
wrote
another
i
quote
the
tenor
of
his
letters
because
though
i
hate
war
i
feel
that
this
is
the
war
to
end
war
we
are
the
last
victims
of
this
way
of
argument
by
smashing
the
german
we
shall
prove
for
all
time
the
criminal
folly
of
militarism
and
there
were
young
idealists
like
that
and
they
were
to
be
envied
for
their
faith
which
they
brought
with
them
from
public
schools
and
from
humble
homes
where
they
had
read
old
books
and
heard
old
watchwords
i
think
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
there
were
many
like
that
but
as
it
continued
year
after
year
doubts
crept
in
dreadful
suspicions
of
truth
more
complex
than
the
old
simplicity
a
sense
of
revolt
against
sacrifice
unequally
shared
and
devoted
to
a
purpose
which
was
not
that
for
which
they
had
been
called
to
fight
they
had
been
told
that
they
were
fighting
for
liberty
but
their
first
lesson
was
the
utter
loss
of
individual
liberty
under
a
discipline
which
made
the
private
soldier
no
more
than
a
number
they
were
ordered
about
like
galley
slaves
herded
about
like
cattle
treated
individually
and
in
the
mass
with
utter
disregard
of
their
comfort
and
often
as
i
know
they
were
detrained
at
in
the
wind
and
rain
and
by
ghastly
errors
of
kept
waiting
for
their
food
until
they
were
weak
and
famished
in
the
base
camps
men
of
one
battalion
were
drafted
into
other
battalions
where
they
lost
their
old
comrades
and
were
unfamiliar
with
the
speech
and
habits
of
a
crowd
belonging
to
different
counties
the
sussex
men
going
to
a
manchester
regiment
the
yorkshire
men
being
drafted
to
a
surrey
unit
by
and
and
camp
commandments
and
town
majors
and
staff
pups
men
were
bullied
and
bundled
about
not
like
human
beings
but
like
dumb
beasts
and
in
a
thousand
ways
injustice
petty
tyranny
hard
work
degrading
punishments
for
trivial
offenses
struck
at
their
souls
and
made
the
name
of
personal
liberty
a
mockery
from
their
own
individuality
they
argued
to
broader
issues
was
this
war
for
liberty
were
the
masses
of
men
on
either
side
fighting
with
free
will
as
free
men
those
germans
were
they
not
under
discipline
each
man
of
them
forced
to
fight
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
compelled
to
go
forward
to
sacrifice
with
behind
them
to
shoot
them
down
if
they
revolted
against
their
what
liberty
had
they
to
follow
their
conscience
or
their
judgment
theirs
not
to
reason
why
theirs
but
to
do
and
die
like
all
soldiers
in
all
armies
was
it
not
rather
that
the
masses
of
men
engaged
in
slaughter
were
serving
the
purpose
of
powers
above
them
rival
powers
greedy
for
one
another
markets
covetous
of
one
another
wealth
and
callous
of
the
lives
of
humble
men
surely
if
the
leaders
of
the
warring
nations
were
put
together
for
even
a
week
in
some
such
place
as
hooge
or
the
hohenzollern
redoubt
afflicted
by
the
usual
harassing
fire
mine
explosions
lice
rats
and
the
stench
of
rotting
corpses
with
the
certainty
of
death
or
dismemberment
at
the
they
would
settle
the
business
and
come
to
terms
before
the
week
was
out
i
heard
that
proposition
put
forward
many
times
by
young
officers
of
ours
and
as
an
argument
against
their
own
sacrifice
they
found
it
unanswerable
v
the
condition
and
psychology
of
their
own
country
as
they
read
about
it
in
the
paris
daily
mail
which
was
first
to
come
into
their
billets
filled
some
of
these
young
men
with
distress
and
disgust
strengthened
into
rage
when
they
went
home
on
leave
the
deliberate
falsification
of
news
the
truth
of
which
they
heard
from
private
channels
made
them
discredit
the
whole
presentation
of
our
case
and
state
they
said
propaganda
with
a
sharp
note
of
scorn
the
breezy
optimism
of
public
men
preachers
and
journalists
never
downcast
by
black
news
never
agonized
by
the
slaughter
in
these
fields
minimizing
horrors
and
loss
and
misery
crowing
over
the
enemy
prophesying
early
victory
which
did
not
come
accepting
all
the
destruction
of
manhood
while
they
stayed
safe
as
a
necessary
and
inevitable
misfortune
had
a
depressing
effect
on
men
who
knew
they
were
doomed
to
die
in
the
law
of
averages
if
the
war
went
on
damn
their
optimism
said
some
of
our
officers
it
too
easy
for
those
behind
the
lines
it
is
only
we
who
have
the
right
of
optimism
it
we
who
have
to
do
the
dirty
work
they
seem
to
think
we
like
the
job
what
are
they
doing
to
bring
the
end
nearer
the
frightful
suspicion
entered
the
heads
of
some
of
our
men
some
of
those
i
knew
that
at
home
people
liked
the
war
and
were
not
anxious
to
end
it
and
did
not
care
a
jot
for
the
sufferings
of
the
soldiers
many
of
them
came
back
from
seven

fuming

sullen

on

below

in

fog
of

staring
across
no

for
the
beginning
of
a
german
attack
in
all
classes
of
people
there
was
an
epidemic
of
dancing
jazzing
they
were
keeping
their
spirits
up
wonderfully
too
well
for
men
slouching
about
the
streets
of
london
on
leave
and
wondering
at
all
this
gaiety
and
thinking
back
to
the
things
they
had
seen
and
forward
to
the
things
they
would
have
to
do
people
at
home
it
seemed
were
not
much
interested
in
the
life
of
the
trenches
anyhow
they
could
not
understand
the
soldier
listened
to
excited
tales
of
air
raids
a
bomb
had
fallen
in
the
next
street
the
windows
had
been
broken
many
people
had
been
killed
in
a
house
somewhere
in
hackney
it
was
frightful
the
germans
were
devils
they
ought
to
be
torn
to
pieces
every
one
of
them
the
soldier
on
leave
saw
crowds
of
people
taking
shelter
in
underground
railways
working
men
among
them
sturdy
lads
but
for
his
own
wife
and
children
he
had
an
evil
sense
of
satisfaction
in
these
sights
it
would
do
them
good
they
would
know
what
war
meant
just
a
little
they
would
not
be
so
easy
in
their
damned
optimism
an
air
raid
lord
god
did
they
know
what
a
german
barrage
was
like
did
they
guess
how
men
walked
day
after
day
through
harassing
fire
to
the
trenches
did
they
have
any
faint
idea
of
life
in
a
sector
where
men
stood
slept
ate
worked
under
the
fire
of
shells
nines
bullets
snipers
to
say
nothing
of
fire
on
the
billets
in
small
farmsteads
and
on
every
moonlight
night
air
raids
above
wooden
hutments
so
closely
crowded
into
a
small
space
that
hardly
a
bomb
could
fall
without
killing
a
group
of
men
oh
but
you
have
your
dugouts
said
a
careless
little
lady
the
soldier
smiled
it
was
no
use
talking
the
people
did
not
want
to
hear
the
tragic
side
of
things
bairnsfather
ole
bill
seemed
to
them
to
typify
the
spirit
of
the
a
mo
kaiser
the
british
soldier
was
gay
and
careless
of
death
always
meant
nothing
to
him
if
he
were
killed
well
after
all
what
else
could
he
expect
was
that
what
he
was
out
for
the
girl
knew
a
charming
boy
in
the
air
force
he
had
made
love
to
her
even
before
charlie
was
done
these
dear
boys
were
so
greedy
for
love
she
could
not
refuse
them
poor
darlings
of
course
they
had
all
got
to
die
for
liberty
and
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
very
sad
a
terrible
thing
war
perhaps
she
had
better
give
up
dancing
for
a
week
until
charlie
had
been
put
into
the
casualty
lists
what
are
we
fighting
for
asked
officers
back
from
leave
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
sketch
and
tatler
with
pictures
of
bare
backed
beauties
at
war
bazaars
and
portraits
of
profiteers
in
the
latest
honors
list
are
we
going
to
die
for
these
swine
these
parasites
and
prostitutes
is
this
the
war
for
noble
ideals
liberty
christianity
and
civilization
to
hell
with
all
this
filth
the
world
has
gone
mad
and
we
are
the
victims
of
some
of
them
said
that
below
all
that
froth
there
were
deep
and
quiet
waters
in
england
they
thought
of
the
anguish
of
their
own
wives
and
mothers
their
noble
patience
their
uncomplaining
courage
their
spiritual
faith
in
the
purpose
of
the
war
perhaps
at
the
heart
england
was
true
and
clean
and
pitiful
perhaps
after
all
many
people
at
home
were
suffering
more
than
the
in
agony
of
spirit
it
was
unwise
to
let
bitterness
poison
their
brains
anyhow
they
had
to
go
on
how
long
how
long
o
lord
how
long
is
it
going
to
last
asked
the
london
rangers
of
their
chaplain
he
lied
to
them
and
said
another
three
months
always
he
had
absolute
knowledge
that
the
war
would
end
three
months
later
that
was
certain
courage
he
said
courage
to
the
end
of
the
last
lap
most
of
the
men
were
dead
and
gone
long
before
the
last
lap
came
it
was
only
the
new
boys
who
went
as
far
as
victory
he
asked
permission
of
the
general
to
withdraw
nineteen
of
them
from
the
line
to
instruct
them
for
communion
they
were
among
the
best
soldiers
and
not
afraid
of
the
ridicule
of
their
fellows
because
of
their
religious
zeal
the
chaplain
main
purpose
was
to
save
their
lives
for
a
while
and
give
them
a
good
time
and
spiritual
comfort
they
had
their
good
time
three
weeks
later
came
the
german
attack
on
arras
and
they
were
all
killed
every
man
of
them
the
chaplain
an
anglican
found
it
hard
to
reconcile
christianity
with
such
a
war
as
this
but
he
did
not
camouflage
the
teachings
of
the
master
he
tried
to
serve
he
preached
to
his
men
the
gospel
of
love
and
forgiveness
of
enemies
it
was
reported
to
the
general
who
sent
for
him
look
here
i
ca
let
you
go
preaching
stuff
to
my
men
i
allow
all
that
nonsense
about
love
my
job
is
to
teach
them
to
hate
you
must
either
cooperate
with
me
or
the
chaplain
refused
to
change
his
faith
or
his
teaching
and
the
general
thought
better
of
his
intervention
for
all
chaplains
it
was
difficult
simple
souls
were
bewildered
by
the
conflict
between
the
spirit
of
christianity
and
the
spirit
of
war
many
of
them
officers
as
well
as
men
were
blasphemous
in
their
scorn
of
parson
stuff
some
of
them
frightfully
ironical
a
friend
of
mine
watched
two
chaplains
passing
by
one
of
them
was
a
tall
man
with
a
crown
and
star
on
his
i
wonder
said
my
friend
with
false
simplicity
whether
jesus
christ
would
have
been
a
lieutenant
colonel
on
the
other
hand
many
men
found
help
in
religion
and
sought
its
comfort
with
a
spiritual
craving
they
did
not
argue
about
christian
ethics
and
modern
warfare
close
to
death
in
the
midst
of
tragedy
conscious
in
a
strange
way
of
their
own
spiritual
being
and
of
a
spirituality
present
among
masses
of
men
above
the
muck
of
war
the
stench
of
corruption
and
fear
of
bodily
extinction
they
groped
out
toward
god
they
searched
for
some
divine
wisdom
greater
than
the
folly
of
the
world
for
a
divine
aid
which
would
help
them
to
greater
courage
the
spirit
of
god
seemed
to
come
to
them
across
no
man
land
with
pity
and
comradeship
catholic
soldiers
had
a
simpler
stronger
faith
than
men
of
protestant
denominations
whose
faith
depended
more
on
ethical
arguments
and
intellectual
reasonings
catholic
chaplains
had
an
easier
task
leaving
aside
all
argument
they
heard
the
confessions
of
the
soldiers
gave
them
absolution
for
their
sins
said
mass
for
them
in
wayside
barns
administered
the
sacraments
held
the
cross
to
their
lips
when
they
fell
mortally
wounded
anointed
them
when
the
surgeon
knife
was
at
work
called
the
names
of
jesus
and
mary
into
dying
ears
there
was
no
need
of
argument
here
the
old
faith
which
has
survived
many
wars
many
plagues
and
the
old
wickedness
of
men
was
still
full
of
consolation
to
those
who
accepted
it
as
little
children
and
by
their
own
agony
hoped
for
favor
from
the
man
of
sorrows
who
was
hanged
upon
a
cross
and
found
a
in
the
vision
of
mary
which
came
to
them
when
they
were
in
fear
and
pain
and
the
struggle
of
death
the
padre
had
a
definite
job
to
do
in
the
trenches
and
for
that
reason
was
allowed
more
liberty
in
the
line
than
other
chaplains
battalion
officers
surgeons
and
nurses
were
patient
with
mysterious
rites
which
they
did
not
understand
but
which
gave
comfort
as
they
saw
to
wounded
men
and
the
heroism
with
which
many
of
those
priests
worked
under
fire
careless
of
their
own
lives
exalted
by
spiritual
fervor
yet
for
the
most
part
human
and
humble
and
and
tolerant
aroused
a
general
admiration
throughout
the
army
many
of
the
protestant
clergy
were
equally
devoted
but
they
were
handicapped
by
having
to
rely
more
upon
providing
physical
comforts
for
the
men
than
upon
spiritual
acts
such
as
anointing
and
absolution
which
were
accepted
without
question
by
catholic
soldiers
yet
the
catholic
church
certain
of
its
faith
and
all
other
churches
claiming
that
they
teach
the
gospel
of
christ
have
been
challenged
to
explain
their
attitude
during
the
war
and
the
relation
of
their
teaching
to
the
the
great
crime
which
has
happened
it
will
not
be
easy
for
them
to
do
so
they
will
have
to
explain
how
it
is
that
german
bishops
priests
pastors
and
flocks
undoubtedly
sincere
in
their
professions
of
faith
deeply
pious
as
our
soldiers
saw
in
cologne
and
fervent
in
their
devotion
to
the
sacraments
on
their
side
of
the
as
the
irish
catholics
on
our
side
were
able
to
reconcile
this
piety
with
their
war
of
aggression
the
faith
of
the
austrian
catholics
must
be
explained
in
relation
to
their
crimes
if
they
were
criminal
as
we
say
they
were
in
leading
the
way
to
this
war
by
their
ultimatum
to
serbia
if
christianity
has
no
restraining
influence
upon
the
brutal
instincts
of
those
who
profess
and
follow
its
faith
then
surely
it
is
time
the
world
abandoned
so
ineffective
a
creed
and
turned
to
other
laws
likely
to
have
more
influence
on
human
relationships
that
brutally
is
the
argument
of
the
thinking
world
against
the
clergy
of
all
nations
who
all
claimed
to
be
acting
according
to
the
justice
of
god
and
the
spirit
of
christ
it
is
a
powerful
argument
for
the
simple
mind
rejecting
casuistry
cuts
straight
to
the
appalling
contrast
between
christian
profession
and
christian
practice
and
says
here
in
this
war
there
was
no
conflict
between
one
faith
and
another
but
a
murderous
between
many
nations
holding
the
same
faith
preaching
the
same
gospel
and
claiming
the
same
god
as
their
protector
let
us
seek
some
better
truth
than
that
hypocrisy
let
us
if
need
be
in
honesty
get
back
to
the
savage
worship
of
national
gods
the
of
the
my
own
belief
is
that
the
war
was
no
proof
against
the
christian
faith
but
rather
is
a
revelation
that
we
are
as
desperately
in
need
of
the
spirit
of
christ
as
at
any
time
in
the
history
of
mankind
but
i
think
the
clergy
of
all
nations
apart
from
a
heroic
and
saintly
few
subordinated
their
faith
which
is
a
gospel
of
charity
to
national
limitations
they
were
patriots
before
they
were
priests
and
their
patriotism
was
sometimes
as
limited
as
narrow
as
fierce
and
as
bloodthirsty
as
that
of
the
people
who
looked
to
them
for
truth
and
light
they
were
often
fiercer
narrower
and
more
desirous
of
vengeance
than
the
soldiers
who
fought
because
it
is
now
a
known
truth
that
the
soldiers
german
and
austrian
french
and
italian
and
british
were
sick
of
the
unending
slaughter
long
before
the
ending
of
the
war
and
would
have
made
a
peace
more
fair
than
that
which
now
prevails
if
it
had
been
put
to
the
common
vote
in
the
trenches
whereas
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
archbishop
of
cologne
and
the
clergy
who
spoke
from
many
pulpits
in
many
nations
under
the
cross
of
christ
still
stoked
up
the
fires
of
hate
and
urged
the
armies
to
go
on
fighting
in
the
cause
of
justice
for
the
defense
of
the
fatherland
for
christian
righteousness
to
the
bitter
end
those
words
are
painful
to
write
but
as
i
am
writing
this
book
for
truth
sake
at
all
cost
i
let
them
stand
vi
the
entire
aspect
of
the
war
was
changed
by
the
russian
revolution
followed
by
the
collapse
of
the
russian
armies
and
the
peace
of
when
for
the
first
time
the
world
heard
the
strange
word
bolshevism
and
knew
not
what
it
meant
the
russian
armies
had
fought
bravely
in
the
first
years
of
the
war
with
an
oriental
disregard
of
death
under
generals
in
german
pay
betrayed
by
a
widespread
net
of
anarchy
and
corruption
so
villainous
that
arms
and
armaments
sent
out
from
england
had
to
be
bribed
on
their
way
from
one
official
to
another
and
never
reached
the
front
so
foul
in
callousness
of
human
life
that
soldiers
were
put
into
the
without
rifle
or
ammunition
these
russian
peasants
flung
themselves
not
once
but
many
times
against
the
finest
troops
of
germany
with
no
more
than
naked
bayonets
against
powerful
artillery
and
the
scythe
of
fire
and
died
like
sheep
in
the
of
chicago
is
it
a
wonder
that
at
the
last
they
revolted
against
this
immolation
turned
round
upon
their
tyrants
and
said
you
are
the
enemy
it
is
you
that
we
will
destroy
by
this
new
revelation
they
forgot
their
hatred
of
germans
they
said
you
are
our
brothers
we
have
no
hatred
against
you
we
do
not
want
to
kill
you
why
should
you
kill
us
we
are
all
of
us
the
slaves
of
bloodthirsty
castes
who
use
our
flesh
for
their
ambitions
do
not
shoot
us
brothers
but
join
hands
against
the
common
tyranny
which
enslaves
our
they
went
forward
with
outstretched
hands
and
were
shot
down
like
rabbits
by
some
germans
and
by
others
were
not
shot
because
german
soldiers
gaped
at
this
new
gospel
as
it
seemed
and
said
they
speak
words
of
truth
why
should
we
kill
one
another
the
german
war
lords
ordered
a
forward
movement
threatened
their
own
men
with
death
if
they
fraternized
with
russians
and
dictated
their
terms
of
peace
on
the
old
lines
of
military
conquest
but
as
ludendorff
has
confessed
and
as
we
now
know
from
other
evidence
many
german
soldiers
were
infected
with
bolshevism
and
lost
their
fighting
spirit
russia
was
already
in
anarchy
constitutional
government
had
been
replaced
by
the
soviets
and
by
committees
of
soldiers
and
workmen
kerensky
had
fled
lenin
and
trotzky
were
the
marat
and
danton
of
the
revolution
and
decreed
the
reign
of
terror
tales
of
appalling
atrocity
some
true
some
false
no
one
can
tell
how
true
or
how
false
came
through
to
france
and
england
it
was
certain
that
the
whole
fabric
of
society
in
russia
had
dissolved
in
the
wildest
anarchy
the
world
has
seen
in
modern
times
and
that
the
bolshevik
gospel
of
brotherhood
with
humanity
was
at
least
rudely
interrupted
by
wholesale
murder
within
its
own
boundaries
one
other
thing
was
certain
having
been
relieved
of
the
russian
menace
germany
was
free
to
withdraw
her
armies
on
that
front
and
use
all
her
striking
force
in
the
west
it
should
have
cautioned
our
generals
to
save
their
men
for
the
greatest
menace
that
had
confronted
them
but
without
caution
they
fought
the
battles
of
in
flanders
as
i
have
told
in
and
in
the
first
half
of
there
seemed
no
ending
to
the
war
by
military
means
even
many
of
our
generals
who
had
been
so
breezy
in
their
optimism
believed
now
that
the
end
must
come
by
diplomatic
means
a
peace
by
i
had
private
talks
with
men
in
high
command
who
acknowledged
that
the
way
must
be
found
and
the
british
mind
prepared
for
negotiations
because
there
must
come
a
limit
to
the
drain
of
blood
on
each
side
it
was
to
one
man
in
the
world
that
many
men
in
all
armies
looked
for
a
way
out
of
this
frightful
impasse
president
wilson
had
raised
new
hope
among
many
men
who
otherwise
were
hopeless
he
not
only
spoke
high
words
but
defined
the
meanings
of
them
his
definition
of
liberty
seemed
sound
and
true
promising
the
of
peoples
his
offer
to
the
german
people
to
deal
generously
with
them
if
they
overthrew
their
tyranny
raised
no
quarrel
among
british
soldiers
his
hope
of
a
new
diplomacy
based
upon
open
covenants
openly
arrived
at
seemed
to
cut
at
the
root
of
the
old
evil
in
europe
by
which
the
fate
of
peoples
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
few
his
fourteen
points
set
out
clearly
and
squarely
a
just
basis
of
peace
his
advocacy
of
a
league
of
nations
held
out
a
vision
of
a
new
world
by
which
the
great
and
small
democracies
should
be
united
by
a
common
pledge
to
preserve
peace
and
submit
their
differences
to
a
supreme
court
of
arbitration
here
at
last
was
a
leader
of
the
world
with
a
clear
call
to
the
nobility
in
men
rather
than
to
their
base
passions
a
gospel
which
would
raise
civilization
from
the
depths
into
which
it
had
fallen
and
a
practical
remedy
for
that
suicidal
mania
which
was
exhausting
the
combatant
nations
i
think
there
were
many
millions
of
men
on
each
side
of
the
who
thanked
god
because
president
wilson
had
come
with
a
wisdom
greater
than
the
folly
which
was
ours
to
lead
the
way
to
an
honorable
peace
and
a
new
order
of
nations
i
was
one
of
them
months
passed
and
there
was
continual
fighting
continued
slaughter
and
no
sign
that
ideas
would
prevail
over
force
the
germans
launched
their
great
offensive
broke
through
the
british
lines
and
afterward
through
the
french
lines
and
there
were
held
and
checked
long
enough
for
our
reserves
to
be
flung
across
the
channel
boys
from
england
and
scotland
who
had
been
held
in
hand
as
the
last
counters
for
the
pool
the
american
army
came
in
tidal
waves
across
the
atlantic
flooded
our
back
areas
reached
the
edge
of
the
battlefields
were
a
new
guaranty
of
strength
their
divisions
passed
mostly
to
the
french
front
with
them
and
with
his
own
men
magnificent
in
courage
still
and
some
of
ours
foch
had
his
army
of
reserve
and
struck
so
the
war
ended
after
all
by
military
force
and
by
military
victory
greater
than
had
seemed
imaginable
or
possible
six
months
before
in
the
peace
terms
that
followed
there
was
but
little
trace
of
those
splendid
ideas
which
had
been
proclaimed
by
president
wilson
on
one
point
after
another
he
weakened
and
was
beaten
by
the
old
militarism
which
sat
enthroned
in
the
with
its
foot
on
the
neck
of
the
enemy
the
of
peoples
was
a
hollow
phrase
signifying
nothing
open
covenants
openly
arrived
at
were
mocked
by
the
closed
doors
of
the
conference
when
at
last
the
terms
were
published
their
merciless
severity
their
disregard
of
racial
boundaries
their
creation
of
hatreds
and
vendettas
which
would
lead
as
sure
as
the
sun
should
rise
to
new
warfare
staggered
humanity
not
only
in
germany
and
austria
but
in
every
country
of
the
world
where
at
least
minorities
of
people
had
hoped
for
some
nobler
vision
of
the
world
needs
and
for
some
healing
remedy
for
the
evils
which
had
massacred
its
youth
the
league
of
nations
which
had
seemed
to
promise
so
well
was
hedged
round
by
limitations
which
made
it
look
bleak
and
barren
still
it
was
peace
and
the
rivers
of
blood
had
ceased
to
flow
and
the
men
were
coming
home
again
home
again
vii
the
men
came
home
in
a
queer
mood
startling
to
those
who
had
not
watched
them
out
there
and
to
those
who
welcomed
peace
with
flags
even
before
their
homecoming
which
was
delayed

after
week
month
after
month
unless
they
were
lucky

and
back
again
quickly
strange
things
began
to
happen
in
france
and
flanders
egypt
and
palestine
men
who
had
been
long
patient
became
suddenly
impatient
men
who
had
obeyed
all
discipline
broke
into
disobedience
bordering
on
mutiny
they
elected
spokesmen
to
represent
their
grievances
like
they
answered
back
to
their
officers
in
such
large
bodies
with
such
threatening
anger
that
it
was
impossible
to
give
them
field
punishment
number
one
or
any
other
number
especially
as
their
battalion
officers
sympathized
mainly
with
their
point
of
view
they
demanded
demobilization
according
to
their
terms
of
service
which
was
for
the
duration
of
the
they
protested
against
the
gross
inequalities
of
selection
by
which
men
of
short
service
were
sent
home
before
those
who
had
been
out
in
they
demanded
justness
fair
play
and
denounced
red
tape
and
official
lies
we
want
to
go
home
was
their
shout
on
parade
a
serious
business
subversive
of
discipline
similar
explosions
were
happening
in
england
bodies
of
men
broke
camp
at
folkestone
and
other
camps
demonstrated
before
town
halls
demanded
to
speak
with

any
old

who
were
in

and

until
they
had
definite
pledges
that
they
would
receive
demobilization
papers
without
delay
whitehall
the
sacred
portals
of
the
war
office
the
holy
ground
of
the
horse
parade
were
invaded
by
bodies
of
men
who
had
commandeered
ambulances
and
lorries
and
had
made
long
journeys
from
their
depots
they
too
demanded
demobilization
they
refused
to
be
drafted
out
for
service
to
india
egypt
archangel
or
anywhere
they
had
done
their
bit
according
to
their
contract
it
was
for
the
war
office
to
fulfil
its
pledges
justice
was
the
word
on
their
lips
and
it
was
a
word
which
put
the
wind
up
as
soldiers
say
any
and
officials
who
had
not
studied
the
laws
of
justice
as
they
concern
private
soldiers
and
who
had
dealt
with
them
after
the
armistice
and
after
the
peace
as
they
had
dealt
with
them
before
as
numbers
counters
to
be
shifted
here
and
there
according
to
the
needs
of
the
high
command
what
was
this
strange
word
justice
on
soldiers
lips
red
tape
squirmed
and
writhed
about
the
business
of
demobilization
orders
were
made
communicated
to
the
men
canceled
even
at
the
railway
gates
promises
were
made
and
broken
conscripts
were
drafted

mesopotamia
archangel
against
their
will
and
contrary
to

men
on
far
fronts
years
absent
from
their
wives
and
homes
were
left
to
stay
there
yearning
for
home
despairing
and
while
the
old
war
was
not
yet
cold
in
its
grave
we
prepared
for
a
new
war
against
bolshevik
russia
arranging
for
the
spending
of
more
millions
the
sacrifice
of
more
boys
of
ours
not
openly
with
the
consent
of
the
people
but
on
the
sly
with
a
fine
art
of
camouflage
the
purpose
of
the
new
war
seemed
to
many
men
who
had
fought
for
liberty
an
outrage
against
the
self
determination
of
peoples
which
had
been
the
fundamental
promise
of
the
league
of
nations
and
a
blatant
hypocrisy
on
the
part
of
a
nation
which
denied
self
government
to
ireland
the
ostensible
object
of
our
intervention
in
russia
was
to
liberate
the
russian
masses
from
the
bloody
tyranny
of
the
bolsheviks
but
this
ardor
for
the
liberty
of
russia
had
not
been
manifest
during
the
reign
of
czardom
and
grand
dukes
when
there
were
massacres
of
mobs
in
moscow
bloody
sundays
in
petersburg
pogroms
in
riga
floggings
of
men
and
girls
in
many
prisons
and
when
free
speech
liberal
ideas
and
democratic
uprisings
had
been
smashed
by
cossack
knout
and
by
the
torture
of
siberian
exile
anyhow
many
people
believed
that
it
was
none
of
our
business
to
suppress
the
russian
revolution
or
to
punish
the
leaders
of
it
and
it
was
suspected
by
british
that
the
real
motive
behind
our
action
was
not
a
noble
enthusiasm
for
liberty
but
an
endeavor
to
establish
a
reactionary
government
in
russia
in
order
to
crush
a
philosophy
of
life
more
dangerous
to
the
old
order
in
europe
than
high
explosives
and
to
get
back
the
gold
that
had
been
poured
into
russia
by
england
and
france
by
a
strange
paradox
of
history
french
journalists
forgetting
their
own
revolution
the
cruelties
of
robespierre
and
marat
the
september
massacres
the
torture
of
marie
antoinette
in
the
tuileries
the
guillotining
of
many
fair
women
of
france
and
after
the
terrors
of
the
commune
were
most
horrified
by
the
anarchy
in
russia
and
most
fierce
in
denunciation
of
the
bloody
struggle
by
which
a
people
made
mad
by
long
oppression
and
infernal
tyrannies
strove
to
gain
the
liberties
of
life
thousands
of
british
soldiers
newly
come
from
war
in
france
were
sullenly
determined
that
they
would
not
be
dragged
off
to
the
new
adventure
they
were
not
alone
as
lord
rothermere
pointed
out
a
french
regiment
mutinied
on
hearing
a
mere
unfounded
report
that
it
was
being
sent
to
the
black
sea
the
united
states
and
japan
were
withdrawing
only
a
few
of
our
men
disillusioned
by
the
ways
of
peace
missing
the
old
comradeship
of
the
ranks
restless
purposeless
not
happy
at
home
seeing
no
prospect
of
good
employment
said
hell
why
not
the
army
again
and
archangel
or
any
old
where
and
volunteered
for
winston
churchill
little
war
after
the
trouble
of
demobilization
came
peace
pageants
and
celebrations
and
but
all
was
not
right
with
the
spirit
of
the
men
who
came
back
something
was
wrong
they
put
on
civilian
clothes
again
looked
to
their
mothers
and
wives
very
much
like
the
young
men
who
had
gone
to
business
in
the
peaceful
days
before
the
august
of
but
they
had
not
come
back
the
same
men
something
had
altered
in
them
they
were
subject
to
queer
moods
queer
tempers
fits
of
profound
depression
alternating
with
a
restless
desire
for
pleasure
many
of
them
were
easily
moved
to
passion
when
they
lost
control
of
themselves
many
were
bitter
in
their
speech
violent
in
opinion
frightening
for
some
time
while
they
drew
their
unemployment
pensions
they
did
not
make
any
effort
to
get
work
for
the
future
they
said
that
can
wait
i
done
my
bit
the
country
can
keep
me
for
a
while
i
helped
to
save
it
let
go
to
the
they
were
listless
when
not
excited
by
some
something
seemed
to
have
snapped
in
them
their
a
quiet
day
at
home
did
not
appeal
to
them
are
you
tired
of
me
said
the
young
wife
wistfully
are
you
glad
to
be
home
it
a
dull
sort
of
life
said
some
of
them
the
boys
unmarried
hung
about
searched
for
their
pals
formed
clubs
where
they
smoked
incessantly
and
talked
in
an
aimless
way
then
began
the
search
for
work
boys
without
training
looked
for
jobs
with
wages
high
enough
to
give
them
a
margin
for
amusement
after
the
cost
of
living
decently
had
been
reckoned
on
the
scale
of
high
prices
mounting
higher
and
higher
not
so
easy
as
they
had
expected
the
girls
were
clinging
to
their
jobs
would
not
let
go
of
the
which
they
had
spent
on
frocks
employers
favored
girl
labor
found
it
efficient
and
on
the
whole
cheap
young
soldiers
who
had
been
very
skilled
with
found
that
they
were
classed
with
the
ranks
of
unskilled
labor
in
civil
life
that
was
not
good
enough
they
had
fought
for
their
country
they
had
served
england
now
they
wanted
good
jobs
with
short
hours
and
good
wages
they
meant
to
get
them
and
meanwhile
prices
were
rising
in
the
shops
suits
of
clothes
boots
food
anything
were
at
double
and
treble
the
price
of
days
the
profiteers
were
rampant
they
were
out
to
bleed
the
men
who
had
been
fighting
they
were
defrauding
the
public
with
sheer
undisguised
robbery
and
the
government
did
nothing
to
check
them
england
they
thought
was
rotten
all
through
who
cared
for
the
men
who
had
risked
their
lives
and
bore
on
their
bodies
the
scars
of
war
the
pensions
doled
out
to
blinded
soldiers
would
not
keep
them
alive
the
consumptives
the
gassed
the
paralyzed
were
forgotten
in
institutions
where
they
lay
hidden
from
the
public
eye
before
the
war
had
been
over
six
months
our
heroes
our
brave
boys
in
the
trenches
were
without
preference
in
the
struggle
for
existence
employers
of
labor
gave
them
no
special
consideration
in
many
offices
they
were
told
bluntly
as
i
know
that
they
had
wasted
three
or
four
years
in
the
army
and
could
not
be
of
the
same
value
as
boys
just
out
of
school
the
officer
class
was
hardest
hit
in
that
way
they
had
gone
straight
from
the
public
schools
and
universities
to
the
army
they
had
been
lieutenants
captains
and
majors
in
the
air
force
or
infantry
battalions
or
tanks
or
and
they
had
drawn
good
pay
which
was
their
now
they
were
at
a
loose
end
hating
the
idea
of
but
ready
to
knuckle
down
to
any
kind
of
decent
job
with
some
prospect
ahead
what
kind
of
job
what
knowledge
had
they
of
use
in
civil
life
none
they
scanned
advertisements
answered
likely
invitations
were
turned
down
by
elderly
men
who
said
i
had
two
hundred
applications
and
none
of
you
young
gentlemen
from
the
army
are
fit
to
be
my
they
were
the
same
elderly
men
who
had
said
we
fight
to
the
last
ditch
if
i
had
six
sons
i
would
sacrifice
them
all
in
the
cause
of
liberty
and
elderly
officers
who
had
lost
their
businesses
for
their
country
sake
who
with
a
noble
devotion
had
given
up
everything
to
do
their
bit
paced
the
streets
searching
for
work
and
were
shown
out
of
every
office
where
they
applied
for
a
post
i
know
one
officer
of
good
family
and
distinguished
service
who
hawked
round
a
subscription
book
to
private
houses
it
took
him
more
courage
than
he
had
needed
under
to
ring
the
bell
and
ask
to
see
the
lady
of
the
he
thanked
god
every
time
the
maid
handed
back
his
card
and
said
not
at
on
the
first
week
work
he
was
four
pounds
out
of
pocket
here
and
there
an
elderly
officer
blew
out
his
brains
another
sucked
a
rubber
tube
fastened
to
the
it
would
have
been
better
if
they
had
fallen
on
the
field
of
honor
where
was
the
nation
gratitude
for
the
men
who
had
fought
and
died
or
fought
and
lived
was
it
for
this
reward
in
peace
that
nearly
a
million
of
our
men
gave
up
their
lives
that
question
is
not
my
question
it
is
the
question
that
was
asked
by
millions
of
men
in
england
in
the
months
that
followed
the
armistice
and
it
was
answered
in
their
own
brains
by
a
bitterness
and
indignation
out
of
which
may
be
lit
the
fires
of
the
revolutionary
spirit
at
in
tramway
cars
in
where
young
men
talked
at
the
table
next
to
mine
i
listened
to
conversations
not
meant
for
my
ears
which
made
me
hear
in
imagination
and
afar
off
yet
not
very
far
perhaps
the
dreadful
rumble
of
revolution
the
violence
of
mobs
led
by
fanatics
it
was
the
talk
mostly
of
demobilized
soldiers
they
asked
one
another
what
did
we
fight
for
and
then
other
questions
such
as
was
this
a
war
for
liberty
or
we
fought
for
the
land
did
we
then
why
should
we
share
the
land
or
why
should
we
be
bled
white
by
profiteers
they
mentioned
the
government
and
then
laughed
in
a
scornful
way
the
government
said
one
man
is
a
conspiracy
against
the
people
all
its
power
is
used
to
protect
those
who
grow
fat
on
big
jobs
big
trusts
big
contracts
it
used
us
to
smash
the
german
empire
in
order
to
strengthen
and
enlarge
the
british
empire
for
the
sake
of
those
who
grab
the
the
the
minerals
and
the
markets
of
the
viii
out
of
such
talk
revolution
is
born
and
revolution
will
not
be
averted
by
pretending
that
such
words
are
not
being
spoken
and
that
such
thoughts
are
not
seething
among
our
it
will
only
be
averted
by
cutting
at
the
root
of
public
suspicion
by
cleansing
our
political
state
of
its
corruption
and
folly
and
by
a
clear
strong
call
of
men
to
a
new
way
of
life
in
which
a
great
people
believing
in
the
honor
and
honesty
of
its
leadership
and
in
fair
reward
for
good
labor
shall
face
a
period
of
poverty
with
courage
and
unselfishly
for
the
good
of
the
commonwealth
inspired
by
a
sense
of
fellowship
with
the
workers
of
other
nations
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
and
many
storms
to
weather
before
we
reach
that
state
if
by
any
grace
that
is
in
us
and
above
us
we
reach
it
for
there
are
disease
and
insanity
in
our
present
state
due
to
the
travail
of
the
war
and
the
education
of
the
war
the
daily
newspapers
for
many
months
have
been
filled
with
the
record
of
dreadful
crimes
of
violence
and
passion
most
of
them
have
been
done
by
soldiers
or
the
attack
on
the
police
station
at
epsom
the
destruction
of
the
town
hall
at
luton
revealed
a
brutality
of
passion
a
murderous
instinct
which
have
been
manifested
again
and
again
in
other
riots
and
street
rows
and
solitary
crimes
those
last
are
the
worst
because
they
are
not
inspired
by
a
sense
of
injustice
however
false
or
any
mob
passion
but
by
homicidal
mania
and
secret
lust
the
many
murders
of
young
women
the
outrages
upon
little
girls
the
violent
robberies
that
have
happened
since
the
demobilizing
of
the
armies
have
appalled
decent
minded
people
they
can
not
understand
the
cause
of
this
epidemic
after
a
period
when
there
was
less
crime
than
usual
the
cause
is
easy
to
understand
it
is
caused
by
the
discipline
and
training
of
modern
warfare
our
armies
as
all
armies
established
an
intensive
culture
of
brutality
they
were
schools
of
slaughter
it
was
the
duty
of
officers
like
ronald
campbell
bayonets
a
delightful
man
to
inspire
in
the
brains
of
gentle
boys
who
instinctively
disliked
butcher
work
by
an
ingenious
system
of
psychology
he
played
upon
their
nature
calling
out
the
primitive
barbarism
which
has
been
overlaid
by
civilized
restraints
liberating
the
brute
which
has
been
long
chained
up
by
law
and
the
social
code
of
gentle
life
but
lurks
always
in
the
secret
lairs
of
the
human
heart
it
is
difficult
when
the
brute
has
been
unchained
for
the
purpose
of
killing
germans
to
get
it
into
the
collar
again
with
a
cry
of
down
dog
down
generals
as
i
have
told
were
against
the
soft
stuff
preached
by
parsons
who
were
not
quite
militarized
though
army
chaplains
they
demanded
the
gospel
of
hate
not
that
of
love
but
hate
when
it
dominates
the
psychology
of
men
is
not
restricted
to
one
objective
such
as
a
body
of
men
behind
barbed
wire
it
is
a
spreading
poison
it
envenoms
the
whole
mind
like
jealousy
it
is
the
monster
which
doth
mock
the
meat
it
feeds
on
our
men
living
in
holes
in
the
earth
like
were
taught
the
ancient
code
of
the
jungle
law
to
track
down
human
beasts
in
no
land
to
jump
upon
their
bodies
in
the
trenches
to
kill
quickly
silently
in
a
raid
to
drop
a
down
a
dugout
crowded
with
men
blowing
their
bodies
to
bits
to
lie
patiently
for
hours
in
a
for
a
sniping
shot
at
any
head
which
showed
to
bludgeon
their
enemy
to
death
or
spit
him
on
a
bit
of
steel
to
get
at
his
throat
if
need
be
with
nails
and
teeth
the
code
of
the
is
bad
for
some
temperaments
it
is
apt
to
become
a
habit
of
mind
it
may
surge
up
again
when
there
are
no
germans
present
but
some
old
woman
behind
an
open
till
or
some
policeman
with
a
lantern
and
a
truncheon
or
in
a
street
riot
where
are
for
the
time
being
the
death
their
own
or
other
people
does
not
mean
very
much
to
some
who
in
the
trenches
sat
within
a
few
yards
of
stinking
corpses
knowing
that
the
next
shell
might
make
such
of
them
life
was
cheap
in
war
is
it
not
cheap
in
peace
the
discipline
of
military
life
is
mainly
an
imposed
discipline
mechanical
and
enforced
in
the
last
resort
not
by
reason
but
by
field
punishment
or
by
a
firing
platoon
whereas
many
men
were
made
brisk
and
alert
by
discipline
and
saw
the
need
of
it
for
the
general
good
others
were
always
in
secret
rebellion
against
its
restraints
of
the
individual
will
and
as
soon
as
they
were
liberated
broke
away
from
it
as
slaves
from
their
chains
and
did
not
substitute
for
that
which
had
weighed
heavy
on
them
with
all
its
discipline
army
life
was
full
of
lounging
hanging
about
waste
of
time
waiting
for
things
to
happen
it
was
an
irresponsible
life
for
the
rank
and
file
food
was
brought
to
them
clothes
were
given
to
them
entertainments
were
provided
behind
the
line
sports
organized
their
day
ordered
by
high
powers
there
was
no
need
to
think
for
themselves
to
act
for
themselves
they
moved
in
herds
dependent
on
their
leaders
that
too
was
a
bad
training
for
the
individualism
of
civil
life
it
tended
to
destroy
personal
initiative
and
willpower
another
evil
of
the
abnormal
life
of
war
sowed
the
seeds
of
insanity
in
the
brains
of
men
not
strong
enough
to
resist
it
sexually
they
were
starved
for
months
they
lived
out
of
the
sight
and
presence
of
women
but
they
came
back
into
villages
or
towns
where
they
were
tempted
by
any
poor
slut
who
winked
at
them
and
infected
them
with
illness
men
went
to
hospital
with
venereal
disease
in
appalling
numbers
boys
were
ruined
and
poisoned
for
life
future
generations
will
pay
the
price
of
war
not
only
in
poverty
and
by
the
loss
of
the
unborn
children
of
the
boys
who
died
but
by
an
enfeebled
stock
and
the
heritage
of
insanity
the
prime
minister
said
one
day
the
world
is
suffering
from
that
was
true
but
it
suffered
also
from
the
symptoms
of
all
that
illness
which
comes
from
syphilis
whose
is
war
the
majority
of
our
men
were
and
clean
hearted
fellows
who
struggled
to
come
unscathed
in
soul
from
most
of
the
horrors
of
war
they
resisted
the
education
of
brutality
and
were
not
envenomed
by
the
gospel
of
hate
out
of
the
dark
depths
of
their
experience
they
looked
up
to
the
light
and
had
visions
of
some
better
law
of
life
than
that
which
led
to
the
it
would
be
a
foul
libel
on
many
of
them
to
besmirch
their
honor
by
a
general
accusation
of
lowered
morality
and
brutal
tendencies
something
in
the
spirit
of
our
race
and
in
the
quality
of
our
home
life
kept
great
numbers
of
them
sound
chivalrous
in
spite
of
the
frightful
influences
of
degradation
bearing
down
upon
them
out
of
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
but
the
weak
men
the
vicious
the
murderous
the
primitive
were
overwhelmed
by
these
influences
and
all
that
was
base
in
them
was
intensified
and
their
passions
were
unleashed
with
what
result
we
have
seen
and
shall
see
to
our
sorrow
and
the
nation
peril
the
nation
was
in
great
peril
after
this
war
and
that
peril
will
not
pass
in
our
lifetime
except
by
heroic
remedies
we
won
victory
in
the
field
and
at
the
cost
of
our
own
ruin
we
smashed
germany
and
austria
and
turkey
but
the
structure
of
our
own
wealth
and
industry
was
shattered
and
the
very
foundations
of
our
power
were
shaken
and
sapped
nine
months
after
the
armistice
great
britain
was
spending
at
the
rate
of
a
day
in
excess
of
her
revenue
she
was
burdened
with
a
national
debt
which
had
risen
from
millions
in
to
millions
in
the
expenditure
of
per
annum
on
the
navy
army
and
civil
service
pensions
and
interest
on
national
debt
had
risen
to
millions
our
exports
were
dwindling
down
owing
to
decreased
output
so
that
foreign
exchanges
were
rising
against
us
and
the
american
dollar
was
increasing
in
value
as
our
proud
old
sovereign
was
losing
its
ancient
standard
so
that
for
all
imports
from
the
united
states
we
were
paying
higher
prices
which
rose
every
time
the
rate
of
exchange
dropped
against
us
the
slaughter
of
men
of
ours
the
disablement
of
many
more
than
that
had
depleted
our
ranks
of
labor
and
there
was
a
paralysis
of
all
our
industry
owing
to
the
dislocation
of
its
machinery
for
purposes
of
war
the
soaring
cost
of
raw
material
the
crippling
effect
of
high
taxation
the
rise
in
wages
to
meet
high
prices
and
the
lethargy
of
the
workers
ruin
immense
engulfing
annihilating
to
our
strength
as
a
nation
and
as
an
empire
stares
us
brutally
in
the
eyes
at
the
time
i
write
this
book
and
i
find
no
consolation
in
the
thought
that
other
nations
in
europe
including
the
german
people
are
in
the
same
desperate
plight
or
worse
ix
the
nation
so
far
has
not
found
a
remedy
for
the
evil
that
has
overtaken
us
rather
in
a
kind
of
madness
that
is
not
without
a
strange
splendor
like
a
ship
that
goes
down
with
drums
beating
and
banners
flying
we
are
racing
toward
the
rocks
at
this
time
when
we
are
sorely
stricken
and
in
dire
poverty
and
debt
we
have
extended
the
responsibilities
of
empire
and
of
world
power
as
though
we
had
illimitable
wealth
our
sphere
of
influence
includes
persia
thibet
arabia
palestine
egypt
a
vast
part
of
the
mohammedan
world
yet
if
any
part
of
our
possessions
were
to
break
into
revolt
or
raise
a
holy
war
against
us
we
should
be
hard
pressed
for
men
to
uphold
our
power
and
prestige
and
our
treasury
would
be
called
upon
in
vain
for
gold
after
the
war
which
was
to
crush
militarism
the
air
force
alone
proposed
an
annual
expenditure
of
more
than
twice
as
much
money
as
the
whole
cost
of
the
army
before
the
war
while
the
armaments
of
the
german
people
whom
we
defeated
in
the
war
against
militarism
are
restricted
to
a
few
warships
and
a
navy
of
men
at
a
cost
reckoned
as
a
year
we
are
threatened
with
a
naval
and
military
program
costing
a
year
was
it
for
this
our
men
fought
was
it
to
establish
a
new
imperialism
upheld
by
the
power
of
guns
that
boys
of
ours
died
in
the
war
of
liberation
i
know
it
was
otherwise
there
are
people
at
the
who
know
and
in
the
and
factories
and
little
houses
in
mean
streets
where
there
are
empty
chairs
and
the
portraits
of
dead
boys
it
will
go
hard
with
the
government
of
england
if
it
plays
a
grandiose
drama
before
hostile
spectators
who
refuse
to
take
part
in
it
it
will
go
hard
with
the
nation
for
it
will
be
engulfed
in
anarchy
at
the
present
time
in
this
august
of
when
i
write
these
words
five
years
after
another
august
this
england
of
ours
this
england
which
i
love
because
its
history
is
in
my
soul
and
its
blood
is
in
my
body
and
i
have
seen
the
glory
of
its
spirit
is
sick
nigh
unto
death
only
great
physicians
may
heal
it
and
its
old
vitality
struggling
against
disease
and
its
old
sanity
against
insanity
our
empire
is
greater
now
in
spaciousness
than
ever
before
but
our
strength
to
hold
it
has
ebbed
low
because
of
much
death
and
a
strain
too
long
endured
and
strangling
debts
the
workman
is
tired
and
has
slackened
in
his
work
in
his
scheme
of
life
he
desires
more
luxury
than
our
poverty
affords
he
wants
higher
wages
shorter
hours
and
less
output
reasonable
desires
in
our
state
before
the
war
unreasonable
now
because
the
cost
of
the
war
has
put
them
beyond
human
possibility
he
wants
low
prices
with
high
wages
and
less
work
it
is
false
arithmetic
and
its
falsity
will
be
proved
by
a
tremendous
crash
some
crash
must
come
tragic
and
shocking
to
our
social
structure
i
see
no
escape
from
that
and
only
the
hope
that
in
that
crisis
the
very
shock
of
it
will
restore
the
mental
balance
of
the
nation
and
that
all
classes
will
combine
under
leaders
of
unselfish
purpose
and
fine
vision
eager
for
evolution
and
not
revolution
for
peace
and
not
for
blood
for
christian
charity
and
not
for
hatred
for
civilization
and
not
for
anarchy
to
reshape
the
conditions
of
our
social
life
and
give
us
a
new
working
order
with
more
equality
of
labor
and
reward
duty
and
sacrifice
liberty
and
discipline
of
the
soul
combining
the
virtue
of
patriotism
with
a
generous
spirit
to
other
peoples
across
the
old
frontiers
of
hate
that
is
the
hope
but
not
the
certainty
it
is
only
by
that
hope
that
one
may
look
back
upon
the
war
with
anything
but
despair
all
the
lives
of
those
boys
whom
i
saw
go
marching
up
the
roads
of
france
and
flanders
to
the
fields
of
death
so
splendid
so
lovely
in
their
youth
will
have
been
laid
down
in
vain
if
by
their
sacrifice
the
world
is
not
uplifted
to
some
plane
a
little
higher
than
the
barbarity
which
was
let
loose
in
europe
they
will
have
been
betrayed
if
the
agony
they
suffered
is
forgotten
and
the
war
to
end
war
leads
to
preparations
for
new
more
monstrous
conflict
or
is
war
the
law
of
human
life
is
there
something
more
powerful
than
kaisers
and
castes
which
drives
masses
of
men
against
other
masses
in
which
they
do
not
understand
are
we
really
poor
beasts
in
the
jungle
striving
by
tooth
and
claw
high
velocity
and
for
the
survival
of
the
fittest
in
an
endless
conflict
if
that
is
so
then
god
mocks
at
us
or
rather
if
that
is
so
there
is
no
god
such
as
we
men
may
love
with
love
for
men
the
world
will
not
accept
that
message
of
despair
and
millions
of
men
who
went
through
the
agony
of
the
war
are
inspired
by
the
humble
belief
that
humanity
may
be
cured
of
its
cruelty
and
stupidity
and
that
a
brotherhood
of
peoples
more
powerful
than
a
league
of
nations
may
be
founded
in
the
world
after
its
present
sickness
and
out
of
the
conflict
of
its
anarchy
that
is
the
new
vision
which
leads
men
on
and
if
we
can
make
one
step
that
way
it
will
be
better
than
that
backward
fall
which
civilization
took
when
germany
played
the
devil
and
led
us
all
into
the
jungle
the
devil
in
germany
had
to
be
killed
there
was
no
other
way
except
by
helping
the
germans
to
kill
it
before
it
mastered
them
now
let
us
exorcise
our
own
devils
and
get
back
to
kindness
toward
all
men
of
good
will
that
also
is
the
only
way
to
heal
the
heart
of
the
world
and
our
own
state
let
us
seek
the
beauty
of
life
and
god
truth
somehow
remembering
the
boys
who
died
too
soon
and
all
the
falsity
and
hatred
of
these
past
five
years
by
blood
and
passion
there
will
be
no
healing
we
have
seen
too
much
blood
we
want
to
wipe
it
out
of
our
eyes
and
souls
let
us
have
peace
