the

consisting
of
rice

in

the

i

had
an
unfortunate

my
dear
e
i
return
you
letter
i
do
not
think
it
answers
any
of
the
questions
debated
in
our
last
conversation
at
all
satisfactorily
the
one
man
has
to
enslave
another
he
has
not
the
hardihood
to
assert
but
in
the
reasons
he
adduces
to
defend
that
act
of
injustice
the
contradictory
statements
he
makes
appear
to
me
to
refute
each
other
he
says
that
to
the
continental
european
protesting
against
the
abstract
iniquity
of
slavery
his
answer
would
be
slaves
are
infinitely
better
off
than
half
the
continental
peasantry
to
the
englishman
are
happy
compared
with
the
miserable
irish
but
supposing
that
this
answered
the
question
of
original
injustice
which
it
does
not
it
is
not
a
true
reply
though
the
negroes
are
fed
clothed
and
housed
and
though
the
irish
peasant
is
starved
naked
and
roofless
the
bare
name
of
freeman
the
lordship
over
his
own
person
the
power
to
choose
and
will
are
blessings
beyond
food
raiment
or
shelter
possessing
which
the
want
of
every
comfort
of
life
is
yet
more
tolerable
than
their
fullest
enjoyment
without
them
ask
the
thousands
of
ragged
destitutes
who
yearly
land
upon
these
shores
to
seek
the
means
of
existence
ask
the
friendless
penniless
foreign
emigrant
if
he
will
give
up
his
present
misery
his
future
uncertainty
his
doubtful
and
difficult
struggle
for
life
at
once
for
the
secure
and
as
it
is
called
fortunate
dependance
of
the
slave
the
indignation
with
which
he
would
spurn
the
offer
will
prove
that
he
possesses
one
good
beyond
all
others
and
that
his
birthright
as
a
man
is
more
precious
to
him
yet
than
the
mess
of
pottage
for
which
he
is
told
to
exchange
it
because
he
is
starving
of
course
the
reverse
alternative
can
not
be
offered
to
the
slaves
for
at
the
very
word
the
riches
of
those
who
own
them
would
make
themselves
wings
and
flee
away
but
i
do
not
admit
the
comparison
between
your
slaves
and
even
the
lowest
class
of
european
free
labourers
for
the
former
are
the
exercise
of
no
faculties
but
those
which
they
enjoy
in
common
with
the
brutes
that
perish
the
just
comparison
is
between
the
slaves
and
the
useful
animals
to
whose
level
your
laws
reduce
them
and
i
will
acknowledge
that
the
slaves
of
a
kind
owner
may
be
as
well
cared
for
and
as
happy
as
the
dogs
and
horses
of
a
merciful
master
but
the
latter
condition
that
of
happiness
must
again
depend
upon
the
complete
perfection
of
their
moral
and
mental
degradation
in
his
letter
maintains
that
they
an
inferior
race
and
compared
with
the
whites
incapable
of
mental
culture
and
moral
improvement
to
this
i
can
only
reply
that
if
they
are
incapable
of
profiting
by
instruction
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
laws
inflicting
heavy
penalties
on
those
who
offer
it
to
them
if
they
really
are
brutish
witless
dull
and
devoid
of
capacity
for
progress
where
lies
the
which
is
constantly
insisted
upon
of
offering
them
that
of
which
they
are
incapable
we
have
no
laws
forbidding
us
to
teach
our
dogs
and
horses
as
much
as
they
can
comprehend
nobody
is
fined
or
imprisoned
for
reasoning
upon
knowledge
and
liberty
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
for
they
are
incapable
of
such
truths
but
these
themes
are
forbidden
to
slaves
not
because
they
can
not
but
because
they
can
and
would
seize
on
them
with
avidity
receive
them
gladly
comprehend
them
quickly
and
the
power
over
them
would
be
annihilated
at
once
and
for
ever
but
i
have
more
frequently
heard
not
that
they
were
incapable
of
receiving
instruction
but
something
much
nearer
the
truth
that
knowledge
only
makes
them
miserable
the
moment
they
are
in
any
degree
enlightened
they
become
unhappy
in
the
letter
i
return
to
you
says
that
the
very
slightest
amount
of
education
merely
teaching
them
to
read
their
value
as
slaves
for
it
instantly
destroys
their
contentedness
and
since
you
do
not
contemplate
changing
their
condition
it
is
surely
doing
them
an
ill
service
to
destroy
their
acquiescence
in
it
but
this
is
a
very
different
ground
of
argument
from
the
other
the
discontent
they
evince
upon
the
mere
dawn
of
an
advance
in
intelligence
proves
not
only
that
they
can
acquire
but
combine
ideas
a
process
to
which
it
is
very
difficult
to
assign
a
limit
and
there
indeed
the
whole
question
lies
and
there
and
nowhere
else
the
shoe
really
pinches
a
slave
is
ignorant
he
eats
drinks
sleeps
labours
and
is
happy
he
learns
to
read
he
feels
thinks
reflects
and
becomes
miserable
he
discovers
himself
to
be
one
of
a
debased
and
degraded
race
deprived
of
the
elementary
rights
which
god
has
granted
to
all
men
alike
every
action
is
controlled
every
word
noted
he
may
not
stir
beyond
his
appointed
bounds
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
at
his
own
will
but
at
the
will
of
another
he
may
be
sent
miles
and
miles
of
weary
journeying
tethered
yoked
collared
and
fettered
away
from
whatever
he
may
know
as
home
severed
from
all
those
ties
of
blood
and
affection
which
he
alone
of
all
human
of
all
living
creatures
on
the
face
of
the
earth
may
neither
enjoy
in
peace
nor
defend
when
they
are
outraged
if
he
is
well
treated
if
his
master
be
tolerably
humane
or
even
understand
his
own
interest
tolerably
this
is
probably
he
may
have
to
endure
it
is
only
to
the
consciousness
of
these
evils
that
knowledge
and
reflection
awaken
him
but
how
is
it
if
his
master
be
severe
harsh
cruel
or
even
only
careless
leaving
his
creatures
to
the
delegated
dominion
of
some
overseer
or
agent
whose
love
of
power
or
other
evil
dispositions
are
checked
by
no
considerations
of
personal
interest
imagination
shrinks
from
the
possible
result
of
such
a
state
of
things
nor
must
you
or
tell
me
that
the
horrors
thus
suggested
exist
only
in
imagination
the
southern
newspapers
with
their
advertisements
of
negro
sales
and
personal
descriptions
of
fugitive
slaves
supply
details
of
misery
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
imagination
to
exceed
scorn
derision
insult
menace
the
handcuff
the
lash
the
tearing
away
of
children
from
parents
of
husbands
from
wives
the
weary
trudging
in
droves
along
the
common
highways
the
labour
of
body
the
despair
of
mind
the
sickness
of
heart
these
are
the
realities
which
belong
to
the
system
and
form
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
in
the
slave
experience
and
this
system
exists
here
in
this
country
of
your
which
boasts
itself
the
asylum
of
the
oppressed
the
home
of
freedom
the
one
place
in
all
the
world
where
all
men
may
find
enfranchisement
from
all
thraldoms
of
mind
soul
or
body
the
land
elect
of
liberty
lays
great
stress
as
a
proof
of
the
natural
inferiority
of
the
blacks
on
the
little
comparative
progress
they
have
made
in
those
states
where
they
enjoy
their
freedom
and
the
fact
that
whatever
quickness
of
parts
they
may
exhibit
while
very
young
on
attaining
maturity
they
invariably
sink
again
into
inferiority
or
at
least
mediocrity
and
indolence
but
surely
there
are
other
causes
to
account
for
this
besides
natural
deficiency
which
must
i
think
be
obvious
to
any
unprejudiced
person
observing
the
condition
of
the
free
blacks
in
your
northern
communities
if
in
the
early
portion
of
their
life
they
escape
the
contempt
and
derision
of
their
white
associates
if
the
blessed
unconsciousness
and
ignorance
of
childhood
keeps
them
for
a
few
years
unaware
of
the
conventional
proscription
under
which
their
whole
race
is
placed
and
it
is
difficult
to
walk
your
streets
and
mark
the
tone
of
insolent
superiority
assumed
by
even
the
over
their
dusky
cotemporaries
and
imagine
this
possible
as
soon
as
they
acquire
the
first
rudiments
of
knowledge
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
grow
up
and
pass
from
infancy
to
youth
as
soon
as
they
cast
the
first
observing
glance
upon
the
world
by
which
they
are
surrounded
and
the
society
of
which
they
are
members
they
must
become
conscious
that
they
are
marked
as
the
hebrew
lepers
of
old
and
are
condemned
to
sit
like
those
unfortunates
without
the
gates
of
every
human
and
social
sympathy
from
their
own
sable
colour
a
pall
falls
over
the
whole
of
god
universe
to
them
and
they
find
themselves
stamped
with
a
badge
of
infamy
of
nature
own
devising
at
sight
of
which
all
natural
kindliness
of
man
to
man
seems
to
recoil
from
them
they
are
not
slaves
indeed
but
they
are
pariahs
debarred
from
all
fellowship
save
with
their
own
despised
race
scorned
by
the
lowest
white
ruffian
in
your
streets
not
tolerated
as
companions
even
by
the
foreign
menials
in
your
kitchen
they
are
free
certainly
but
they
are
also
degraded
rejected
the
offscum
and
the
offscouring
of
the
very
dregs
of
your
society
they
are
free
from
the
chain
the
whip
the
enforced
task
and
unpaid
toil
of
slavery
but
they
are
not
the
less
under
a
ban
their
kinship
with
slaves
for
ever
bars
them
from
a
full
share
of
the
inheritance
of
equal
rights
and
equal
consideration
and
respect
all
hands
are
extended
to
thrust
them
out
all
fingers
point
at
their
dusky
skin
all
tongues
the
most
vulgar
as
well
as
the
most
refined
have
learnt
to
turn
the
very
name
of
their
race
into
an
insult
and
a
reproach
how
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
natural
probable
possible
should
the
spirit
and
energy
of
any
human
creature
support
itself
under
such
an
accumulation
of
injustice
and
obloquy
where
shall
any
mass
of
men
be
found
with
power
of
character
and
mind
sufficient
to
bear
up
against
such
a
weight
of
prejudice
why
if
one
individual
rarely
gifted
by
heaven
were
to
raise
himself
out
of
such
a
slough
of
despond
he
would
be
a
miracle
and
what
would
be
his
reward
would
he
be
admitted
to
an
equal
share
in
your
political
rights
would
he
ever
be
allowed
to
cross
the
threshold
of
your
doors
would
any
of
you
give
your
daughter
to
his
son
or
your
son
to
his
daughter
would
you
in
any
one
particular
admit
him
to
the
footing
of
equality
which
any
man
with
a
white
skin
would
claim
whose
ability
and
worth
had
so
raised
him
from
the
lower
degrees
of
the
social
scale
you
would
turn
from
such
propositions
with
abhorrence
and
the
servants
in
your
kitchen
and
stable
the
ignorant
and
boorish
refuse
of
foreign
populations
in
whose
countries
no
such
prejudice
exists
imbibing
it
with
the
very
air
they
breathe
here
would
shrink
from
eating
at
the
same
table
with
such
a
man
or
holding
out
the
hand
of
common
fellowship
to
him
under
the
species
of
social
proscription
in
which
the
blacks
in
your
northern
cities
exist
if
they
preserved
energy
of
mind
enterprise
of
spirit
or
any
of
the
best
attributes
and
powers
of
free
men
they
would
prove
themselves
instead
of
the
lowest
and
least
of
human
races
the
highest
and
first
not
only
of
all
that
do
exist
but
of
all
that
ever
have
existed
for
they
alone
would
seek
and
cultivate
knowledge
goodness
truth
science
art
refinement
and
all
improvement
purely
for
the
sake
of
their
own
excellence
and
without
one
of
those
incentives
of
honour
power
and
fortune
which
are
found
to
be
the
chief
too
often
the
only
inducements
which
lead
white
men
to
the
pursuit
of
the
same
objects
you
know
very
well
dear
e
that
in
speaking
of
the
free
blacks
of
the
north
i
here
state
nothing
but
what
is
true
and
of
daily
experience
only
last
week
i
heard
in
this
very
town
of
philadelphia
of
a
family
of
strict
probity
and
honour
highly
principled
intelligent
and
accomplished
and
to
speak
the
world
language
respectable
in
every
way
upon
an
english
lady
stating
it
to
be
her
intention
to
visit
these
persons
when
she
came
to
philadelphia
she
was
told
that
if
she
did
nobody
else
would
visit
and
she
probably
would
excite
a
malevolent
feeling
which
might
find
vent
in
some
violent
demonstration
against
this
family
all
that
i
have
now
said
of
course
bears
only
upon
the
condition
of
the
free
coloured
population
of
the
north
with
which
i
am
familiar
enough
to
speak
confidently
of
it
as
for
the
slaves
and
their
capacity
for
progress
i
can
say
nothing
for
i
have
never
been
among
them
to
judge
what
faculties
their
unhappy
social
position
leaves
to
them
unimpaired
but
it
seems
to
me
that
no
experiment
on
a
sufficiently
large
scale
can
have
been
tried
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
determine
the
question
of
their
incurable
inferiority
physiologists
say
that
three
successive
generations
appear
to
be
necessary
to
produce
an
effectual
change
of
constitution
bodily
and
mental
be
it
for
health
or
disease
there
are
positive
physical
defects
which
produce
positive
mental
ones
the
diseases
of
the
muscular
and
nervous
systems
descend
from
father
to
son
upon
the
agency
of
one
corporal
power
how
much
that
is
not
corporal
depends
from
generation
to
generation
internal
disease
and
external
deformity
vices
virtues
talents
and
deficiencies
are
transmitted
and
by
the
action
of
the
same
law
it
must
be
long
indeed
before
the
offspring
of
slaves
creatures
begotten
of
a
race
debased
and
degraded
to
the
lowest
degree
themselves
born
in
slavery
and
whose
progenitors
have
eaten
the
bread
and
drawn
the
breath
of
slavery
for
years
can
be
measured
with
any
show
of
justice
by
even
the
least
favoured
descendants
of
european
nations
whose
qualities
have
been
for
centuries
developing
themselves
under
the
beneficent
influence
of
freedom
and
the
progress
it
inspires
i
am
rather
surprised
at
the
outbreak
of
violent
disgust
which
indulges
in
on
the
subject
of
amalgamation
as
that
formed
no
part
of
our
discussion
and
seems
to
me
a
curious
subject
for
abstract
argument
i
should
think
the
intermarrying
between
blacks
and
whites
a
matter
to
be
as
little
insisted
upon
if
repugnant
as
prevented
if
agreeable
to
the
majority
of
the
two
races
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
help
being
astonished
at
the
furious
and
ungoverned
execration
which
all
reference
to
the
possibility
of
a
fusion
of
the
races
draws
down
upon
those
who
suggest
it
because
nobody
pretends
to
deny
that
throughout
the
south
a
large
proportion
of
the
population
is
the
offspring
of
white
men
and
coloured
women
in
new
orleans
a
class
of
unhappy
females
exists
whose
mingled
blood
does
not
prevent
their
being
remarkable
for
their
beauty
and
with
whom
no
man
no
in
that
city
shrinks
from
associating
and
while
the
slaveowners
of
the
southern
states
insist
vehemently
upon
the
mental
and
physical
inferiority
of
the
blacks
they
are
benevolently
doing
their
best
in
one
way
at
least
to
raise
and
improve
the
degraded
race
and
the
bastard
population
which
forms
so
ominous
an
element
in
the
social
safety
of
their
cities
certainly
exhibit
in
their
forms
and
features
the
benefit
they
derive
from
their
white
progenitors
it
is
hard
to
conceive
that
some
mental
improvement
does
not
accompany
this
physical
change
already
the
finer
forms
of
the
european
races
are
cast
in
these
dusky
moulds
the
outward
configuration
can
hardly
thus
improve
without
corresponding
progress
in
the
inward
capacities
the
white
man
blood
and
bones
have
begotten
this
bronze
race
and
bequeathed
to
it
in
some
degree
qualities
tendencies
capabilities
such
as
are
the
inheritance
of
the
highest
order
of
human
animals
and
many
others
speaks
as
if
there
were
a
natural
repugnance
in
all
whites
to
any
alliance
with
the
black
race
and
yet
it
is
notorious
that
almost
every
southern
planter
has
a
family
more
or
less
numerous
of
illegitimate
coloured
children
most
certainly
few
people
would
like
to
assert
that
such
connections
are
formed
because
it
is
the
of
these
planters
to
increase
the
number
of
their
human
property
and
that
they
add
to
their
revenue
by
the
closest
intimacy
with
creatures
that
they
loathe
in
order
to
reckon
among
their
wealth
the
children
of
their
body
surely
that
is
a
monstrous
and
unnatural
supposition
and
utterly
unworthy
of
belief
that
such
connections
exist
commonly
is
a
sufficient
proof
that
they
are
not
abhorrent
to
nature
but
it
seems
indeed
as
if
marriage
and
not
concubinage
was
the
horrible
enormity
which
can
not
be
tolerated
and
against
which
moreover
it
has
been
deemed
expedient
to
enact
laws
now
it
appears
very
evident
that
there
is
no
law
in
the
white
man
nature
which
prevents
him
from
making
a
coloured
woman
the
mother
of
his
children
but
there
a
law
on
his
statute
books
forbidding
him
to
make
her
his
wife
and
if
we
are
to
admit
the
theory
that
the
mixing
of
the
races
is
a
monstrosity
it
seems
almost
as
curious
that
laws
should
be
enacted
to
prevent
men
marrying
women
towards
whom
they
have
an
invincible
natural
repugnance
as
that
education
should
by
law
be
prohibited
to
creatures
incapable
of
receiving
it
as
for
the
exhortation
with
which
closes
his
letter
that
i
will
not
down
to
my
plantation
prejudiced
against
what
i
am
to
find
there
i
know
not
well
how
to
answer
it
assuredly
i
going
prejudiced
against
slavery
for
i
am
an
englishwoman
in
whom
the
absence
of
such
a
prejudice
would
be
disgraceful
nevertheless
i
go
prepared
to
find
many
mitigations
in
the
practice
to
the
general
injustice
and
cruelty
of
the
system
much
kindness
on
the
part
of
the
masters
much
content
on
that
of
the
slaves
and
i
feel
very
sure
that
you
may
rely
upon
the
carefulness
of
my
observation
and
the
accuracy
of
my
report
of
every
detail
of
the
working
of
the
thing
that
comes
under
my
notice
and
certainly
on
the
plantation
to
which
i
am
going
it
will
be
more
likely
that
i
should
some
things
extenuate
than
set
down
aught
in
malice
yours
ever
faithfully
darien
georgia
dear
e
minuteness
of
detail
and
fidelity
in
the
account
of
my
daily
doings
will
hardly
i
fear
render
my
letters
very
interesting
to
you
now
but
cut
off
as
i
am
here
from
all
the
usual
resources
and
amusements
of
civilised
existence
i
shall
find
but
little
to
communicate
to
you
that
is
not
furnished
by
my
observations
on
the
novel
appearance
of
external
nature
and
the
moral
and
physical
condition
of
people
the
latter
subject
is
i
know
one
sufficiently
interesting
in
itself
to
you
and
i
shall
not
scruple
to
impart
all
the
reflections
which
may
occur
to
me
relative
to
their
state
during
my
stay
here
where
enquiry
into
their
mode
of
existence
will
form
my
chief
occupation
and
necessarily
also
the
staple
commodity
of
my
letters
i
purpose
while
i
reside
here
keeping
a
sort
of
journal
such
as
monk
lewis
wrote
during
his
visit
to
his
west
india
plantations
i
wish
i
had
any
prospect
of
rendering
my
diary
as
interesting
and
amusing
to
you
as
his
was
to
me
in
taking
my
first
walk
on
the
island
i
directed
my
steps
towards
the
rice
mill
a
large
building
on
the
banks
of
the
river
within
a
few
yards
of
the
house
we
occupy
is
it
not
rather
curious
that
miss
martineau
should
have
mentioned
the
erection
of
a
steam
mill
for
threshing
rice
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
charleston
as
a
singular
novelty
likely
to
form
an
era
in
southern
agriculture
and
to
produce
the
most
desirable
changes
in
the
system
of
labour
by
which
it
is
carried
on
now
on
this
estate
alone
there
are
three
threshing
mills
one
worked
by
steam
one
by
the
tide
and
one
by
horses
there
are
two
private
steam
mills
on
plantations
adjacent
to
ours
and
a
public
one
at
savannah
where
the
planters
who
have
none
on
their
own
estates
are
in
the
habit
of
sending
their
rice
to
be
threshed
at
a
certain
percentage
these
have
all
been
in
operation
for
some
years
and
i
therefore
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
made
her
hail
the
erection
of
the
one
at
charleston
as
likely
to
produce
such
immediate
and
happy
results
by
the
bye
of
the
misstatements
or
rather
mistakes
for
they
are
such
in
her
books
with
regard
to
certain
facts
her
only
disadvantage
in
acquiring
information
was
not
by
any
means
that
natural
infirmity
on
which
the
periodical
press
both
here
and
in
england
has
commented
with
so
much
brutality
she
had
the
misfortune
to
possess
too
that
unsuspecting
reliance
upon
the
truth
of
others
which
they
are
apt
to
feel
who
themselves
hold
truth
most
sacred
and
this
was
a
sore
disadvantage
to
her
in
a
country
where
i
have
heard
it
myself
repeatedly
asserted
and
what
is
more
much
gloried
in
that
she
was
purposely
misled
by
the
persons
to
whom
she
addressed
her
enquiries
who
did
not
scruple
to
disgrace
themselves
by
imposing
in
the
grossest
manner
upon
her
credulity
and
anxiety
to
obtain
information
it
is
a
knowledge
of
this
very
shameful
proceeding
which
has
made
me
most
especially
anxious
to
avoid
i
might
fill
my
letters
to
you
with
accounts
received
from
others
but
as
i
am
aware
of
the
risk
which
i
run
in
so
doing
i
shall
furnish
you
with
no
details
but
those
which
come
under
my
own
immediate
observation
to
return
to
the
rice
mill
it
is
worked
by
a
of
thirty
horse
power
and
besides
threshing
great
part
of
our
own
rice
is
kept
constantly
employed
by
the
neighbouring
planters
who
send
their
grain
to
it
in
preference
to
the
more
distant
mill
at
savannah
paying
of
course
the
same
percentage
which
makes
it
a
very
profitable
addition
to
the
estate
immediately
opposite
to
this
building
is
a
small
shed
which
they
call
the
cook
shop
and
where
the
daily
allowance
of
rice
and
corn
grits
of
the
people
is
boiled
and
distributed
to
them
by
an
old
woman
whose
special
business
this
is
there
are
four
settlements
or
villages
or
as
the
negroes
call
them
camps
on
the
island
consisting
of
from
ten
to
twenty
houses
and
to
each
settlement
is
annexed
a
cook
shop
with
capacious
cauldrons
and
the
oldest
wife
of
the
settlement
for
officiating
priestess
pursuing
my
walk
along
the
river
bank
upon
an
artificial
dyke
sufficiently
high
and
broad
to
protect
the
fields
from
inundation
by
the
ordinary
rising
of
the
tide
for
the
whole
island
is
below
high
water
mark
i
passed
the
blacksmith
and
cooper
shops
at
the
first
all
the
common
iron
implements
of
husbandry
or
household
use
for
the
estate
are
made
and
at
the
latter
all
the
rice
barrels
necessary
for
the
crop
besides
tubs
and
buckets
large
and
small
for
the
use
of
the
people
and
cedar
tubs
of
noble
dimensions
and
exceedingly
neat
workmanship
for
our
own
household
purposes
the
fragrance
of
these
when
they
are
first
made
as
well
as
their
ample
size
renders
them
preferable
as
furniture
in
my
opinion
to
all
the
china
that
ever
came
out
of
staffordshire
after
this
i
got
out
of
the
vicinity
of
the
settlement
and
pursued
my
way
along
a
narrow
dyke
the
river
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
a
slimy
swamp
all
rattling
with
sedges
of
enormous
height
in
which
one
might
lose
one
way
as
effectually
as
in
a
forest
of
oaks
beyond
this
the
low
all
clothed
in
their
rugged
stubble
divided
by
dykes
into
monotonous
squares
a
species
of
prospect
by
no
means
beautiful
to
the
mere
lover
of
the
picturesque
the
only
thing
that
i
met
with
to
attract
my
attention
was
a
most
beautiful
species
of
ivy
the
leaf
longer
and
more
graceful
than
that
of
the
common
english
creeper
glittering
with
the
highest
varnish
delicately
veined
and
of
a
rich
brown
green
growing
in
profuse
garlands
from
branch
to
branch
of
some
stunted
evergreen
bushes
which
border
the
dyke
and
which
the
people
call
bush
my
walks
are
rather
circumscribed
inasmuch
as
the
dykes
are
the
only
promenades
on
all
sides
of
these
lie
either
the
marshy
the
brimming
river
or
the
swampy
patches
of
yet
unreclaimed
forest
where
the
huge
cypress
trees
and
exquisite
evergreen
undergrowth
spring
up
from
a
stagnant
sweltering
pool
that
effectually
forbids
the
foot
of
the
explorer
as
i
skirted
one
of
these
thickets
i
stood
still
to
admire
the
beauty
of
the
shrubbery
every
shade
of
green
every
variety
of
form
every
degree
of
varnish
and
all
in
full
leaf
and
beauty
in
the
very
depth
of
winter
the
stunted
oak
the
magnolia
bay
like
our
own
culinary
and
fragrant
bay
which
grows
to
a
very
great
size
the
wild
myrtle
a
beautiful
and
profuse
shrub
rising
to
a
height
of
six
eight
and
ten
feet
and
branching
on
all
sides
in
luxuriant
tufted
fullness
most
beautiful
of
all
that
pride
of
the
south
the
magnolia
grandiflora
whose
lustrous
dark
green
perfect
foliage
would
alone
render
it
an
object
of
admiration
without
the
queenly
blossom
whose
colour
size
and
perfume
are
unrivalled
in
the
whole
vegetable
kingdom
this
last
magnificent
creature
grows
to
the
size
of
a
forest
tree
in
these
swamps
but
seldom
adorns
a
high
or
dry
soil
or
suffers
itself
to
be
successfully
transplanted
under
all
these
the
spiked
palmetto
forms
an
impenetrable
covert
and
from
glittering
graceful
branch
to
branch
hang
garlands
of
evergreen
creepers
on
which
the
are
swinging
and
singing
even
now
while
i
bethinking
me
of
the
pinching
cold
that
is
at
this
hour
tyrannising
over
your
region
look
round
on
this
strange
scene
on
these
green
woods
this
unfettered
river
and
sunny
sky
and
feel
very
much
like
one
in
another
planet
from
yourself
the
profusion
of
birds
here
is
one
thing
that
strikes
me
as
curious
coming
from
the
vicinity
of
philadelphia
where
even
the
robin
redbreast
held
sacred
by
the
humanity
of
all
other
christian
people
is
not
safe
from
the
prowess
of
the
unlicensed
sportsmen
of
your
free
country
the
negroes
of
course
are
not
allowed
the
use
of
firearms
and
their
very
simply
constructed
traps
do
not
do
much
havoc
among
the
feathered
hordes
that
haunt
their
their
case
is
rather
a
hard
one
as
partridges
snipes
and
the
most
delicious
wild
ducks
abound
here
and
their
allowance
of
rice
and
indian
meal
would
not
be
the
worse
for
such
additions
no
day
passes
that
i
do
not
in
the
course
of
my
walk
put
up
a
number
of
the
land
birds
and
startle
from
among
the
gigantic
sedges
the
by
dozens
it
arouses
the
killing
propensity
in
me
most
dreadfully
and
i
really
entertain
serious
thoughts
of
learning
to
use
a
gun
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
destroying
these
pretty
birds
as
they
whirr
from
their
secret
coverts
close
beside
my
path
how
strong
an
instinct
of
animal
this
is
and
how
strange
if
one
be
more
strange
than
another
reflection
rebukes
it
almost
instantaneously
and
yet
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
help
wishing
i
had
a
whenever
i
put
up
a
covey
of
these
creatures
though
i
suppose
if
one
were
brought
bleeding
and
maimed
to
me
i
should
begin
to
cry
and
be
very
pathetic
after
the
fashion
of
jacques
however
one
must
live
you
know
and
here
our
living
consists
very
mainly
of
wild
ducks
wild
geese
wild
turkeys
and
venison
nor
perhaps
can
one
imagine
the
universal
doom
overtaking
a
creature
with
less
misery
than
in
the
case
of
the
bird
who
in
the
very
moment
of
his
triumphant
soaring
is
brought
dead
to
the
ground
i
should
like
to
bargain
for
such
a
finis
myself
amazingly
i
know
and
have
always
thought
that
the
death
i
should
prefer
would
be
to
break
my
neck
off
the
back
of
my
horse
at
a
full
gallop
on
a
fine
day
of
course
a
bad
shot
should
be
hung
a
man
who
shatters
his
birds
wings
and
legs
if
i
undertook
the
trade
i
would
learn
of
some
southern
duellist
and
always
shoot
my
bird
through
the
head
or
heart
as
an
expert
murderer
knows
how
besides
these
birds
of
which
we
make
our
prey
there
are
others
that
prey
upon
their
own
fraternity
hawks
of
every
sort
and
size
wheel
their
steady
rounds
above
the
and
the
great
turkey
buzzards
those
most
unsightly
carrion
birds
spread
their
broad
black
wings
and
soar
over
the
river
like
so
many
mock
eagles
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
saw
any
winged
creature
of
so
forbidding
an
aspect
as
these
same
turkey
buzzards
their
heavy
flight
their
awkward
gait
their
head
and
neck
and
their
devotion
to
every
species
of
foul
and
detestable
food
render
them
almost
abhorrent
to
me
they
abound
in
the
south
and
in
charleston
are
held
in
especial
veneration
for
their
propensities
killing
one
of
them
being
i
believe
a
fineable
offence
by
the
city
police
regulations
among
the
brobdignagian
sedges
that
in
some
parts
of
the
island
fringe
the
altamaha
the
nightshade
apparently
the
same
as
the
european
creeper
weaves
a
perfect
matting
of
its
poisonous
garlands
and
my
remembrance
of
its
prevalence
in
the
woods
and
hedges
of
england
did
not
reconcile
me
to
its
appearance
here
how
much
of
this
is
mere
association
i
can
not
tell
but
whether
the
wild
duck
makes
its
nest
under
its
green
arches
or
the
alligators
and
snakes
of
the
altamaha
have
their
secret
bowers
there
it
is
an
weed
and
i
shall
have
every
leaf
of
it
cleared
away
i
must
inform
you
of
a
curious
conversation
which
took
place
between
my
little
girl
and
the
woman
who
performs
for
us
the
offices
of
chambermaid
here
of
course
one
of
slaves
what
suggested
it
to
the
child
or
whence
indeed
she
gathered
her
information
i
know
not
but
children
are
made
of
eyes
and
ears
and
nothing
however
minute
escapes
their
microscopic
observation
she
suddenly
began
addressing
this
woman
some
persons
are
free
and
some
are
not
the
woman
made
no
reply
i
am
a
free
person
of
a
little
more
than
three
years
old
i
say
i
am
a
free
person
mary
do
you
know
that
missis
persons
are
free
and
some
are
not
do
you
know
that
mary
missis
was
the
reply
know
it
is
so
here
in
this
world
here
my
child
white
nurse
my
dear
margery
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
interfered
saying
then
you
think
it
will
not
always
be
so
hope
not
missis
i
am
afraid
e
this
woman
actually
imagines
that
there
will
be
no
slaves
in
heaven
is
that
preposterous
now
when
by
the
account
of
most
of
the
southerners
slavery
itself
must
be
heaven
or
something
uncommonly
like
it
oh
if
you
could
imagine
how
this
title
addressed
to
me
and
to
my
children
shocks
all
my
feelings
several
times
i
have
exclaimed
god
sake
do
not
call
me
that
and
only
been
awakened
by
the
stupid
amazement
of
the
poor
creatures
i
was
addressing
to
the
perfect
uselessness
of
my
thus
expostulating
with
them
once
or
twice
indeed
i
have
done
more
i
have
explained
to
them
and
they
appeared
to
comprehend
me
well
that
i
had
no
ownership
over
them
for
that
i
held
such
ownership
sinful
and
that
though
i
was
the
wife
of
the
man
who
pretends
to
own
them
i
was
in
truth
no
more
their
mistress
than
they
were
mine
some
of
them
i
know
understood
me
more
of
them
did
not
our
servants
those
who
have
been
selected
to
wait
upon
us
in
the
house
consist
of
a
man
who
is
quite
a
tolerable
cook
i
believe
this
is
a
natural
gift
with
them
as
with
frenchmen
a
dairywoman
who
churns
for
us
a
laundrywoman
her
daughter
our
housemaid
the
aforesaid
mary
and
two
young
lads
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
who
wait
upon
us
in
the
capacity
of
footmen
as
however
the
latter
are
perfectly
filthy
in
their
persons
and
clothes
their
faces
hands
and
naked
feet
being
literally
encrusted
with
dirt
their
attendance
at
our
meals
is
not
as
you
may
suppose
particularly
agreeable
to
me
and
i
dispense
with
it
as
often
as
possible
mary
too
is
so
intolerably
offensive
in
her
person
that
it
is
impossible
to
endure
her
proximity
and
the
consequence
is
that
amongst
slaves
i
wait
upon
myself
more
than
i
have
ever
done
in
my
life
before
about
this
same
personal
offensiveness
the
southerners
you
know
insist
that
it
is
inherent
with
the
race
and
it
is
one
of
their
most
cogent
reasons
for
keeping
them
as
slaves
but
as
this
very
disagreeable
peculiarity
does
not
prevent
southern
women
from
hanging
their
infants
at
the
breasts
of
negresses
nor
almost
every
planter
wife
and
daughter
from
having
one
or
more
little
pet
blacks
sleeping
like
puppy
dogs
in
their
very
bedchamber
nor
almost
every
planter
from
admitting
one
or
several
of
his
female
slaves
to
the
still
closer
intimacy
of
his
bed
it
seems
to
me
that
this
objection
to
doing
them
right
is
not
very
valid
i
can
not
imagine
that
they
would
smell
much
worse
if
they
were
free
or
come
in
much
closer
contact
with
the
delicate
organs
of
their
white
fellow
countrymen
indeed
inasmuch
as
good
deeds
are
spoken
of
as
having
a
sweet
savour
before
god
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
freeing
of
the
blacks
might
prove
rather
an
odoriferous
process
than
the
contrary
however
this
may
be
i
must
tell
you
that
this
potent
reason
for
enslaving
a
whole
race
of
people
is
no
more
potent
with
me
than
most
of
the
others
adduced
to
support
the
system
inasmuch
as
from
observation
and
some
experience
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
peculiar
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
health
and
the
habits
of
decent
cleanliness
are
the
real
and
only
causes
of
this
disagreeable
characteristic
of
the
race
thorough
ablutions
and
change
of
linen
when
tried
having
been
perfectly
successful
in
removing
all
such
objections
and
if
ever
you
have
come
into
anything
like
neighbourly
proximity
with
a
low
irishman
or
woman
i
think
you
will
allow
that
the
same
causes
produce
very
nearly
the
same
effects
the
stench
in
an
irish
scotch
italian
or
french
hovel
are
quite
as
intolerable
as
any
i
ever
found
in
our
negro
houses
and
the
filth
and
vermin
which
abound
about
the
clothes
and
persons
of
the
lower
peasantry
of
any
of
those
countries
as
abominable
as
the
same
conditions
in
the
black
population
of
the
united
states
a
total
absence
of
begets
these
hateful
physical
results
and
in
proportion
as
moral
influences
are
remote
physical
evils
will
abound
freedom
and
industry
induce
induces
cleanliness
and
personal
attention
so
that
slavery
is
answerable
for
all
the
evils
that
exhibit
themselves
where
it
exists
from
lying
thieving
and
adultery
to
dirty
houses
ragged
clothes
and
foul
smells
but
to
return
to
our
ganymedes
one
of
them
the
eldest
son
of
our
laundrywoman
and
mary
brother
a
boy
of
the
name
of
aleck
alexander
is
uncommonly
bright
and
intelligent
he
performs
all
the
offices
of
a
waiter
with
great
efficiency
and
anywhere
out
of
slave
land
would
be
able
to
earn
fourteen
or
fifteen
dollars
a
month
for
himself
he
is
remarkably
good
tempered
and
well
disposed
the
other
poor
boy
is
so
stupid
that
he
appears
sullen
from
absolute
darkness
of
intellect
instead
of
being
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
he
is
scarcely
a
little
higher
than
the
brutes
and
to
this
condition
are
reduced
the
majority
of
his
kind
by
the
institutions
under
which
they
live
i
should
tell
you
that
aleck
parents
and
kindred
have
always
been
about
the
house
of
the
overseer
and
in
daily
habits
of
intercourse
with
him
and
his
wife
and
wherever
this
is
the
case
the
effect
of
involuntary
education
is
evident
in
the
improved
intelligence
of
the
degraded
race
in
a
conversation
which
had
this
evening
with
o
the
overseer
the
latter
mentioned
that
two
of
our
carpenters
had
in
their
leisure
time
made
a
boat
which
they
had
disposed
of
to
some
neighbouring
planter
for
sixty
dollars
now
e
i
have
no
intention
of
telling
you
a
story
or
concealing
from
you
what
are
cited
as
the
advantages
which
these
poor
people
possess
you
who
know
that
no
indulgence
is
worth
simple
justice
either
to
him
who
gives
or
him
who
receives
will
not
thence
conclude
that
their
situation
thus
mitigated
is
therefore
what
it
should
be
on
this
matter
of
the
sixty
dollars
earned
by
two
men
much
stress
was
laid
by
him
and
his
overseer
i
look
at
it
thus
if
these
men
were
industrious
enough
out
of
their
scanty
leisure
to
earn
sixty
dollars
how
much
more
of
remuneration
of
comfort
of
improvement
might
they
not
have
achieved
were
the
price
of
their
daily
labour
duly
paid
them
instead
of
being
unjustly
withheld
to
support
an
idle
young
man
and
his
idle
family
myself
and
my
children
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
inform
you
that
the
slaves
on
this
plantation
are
divided
into
field
hands
and
mechanics
or
artisans
the
former
the
great
majority
are
the
more
stupid
and
brutish
of
the
tribe
the
others
who
are
regularly
taught
their
trades
are
not
only
exceedingly
expert
at
them
but
exhibit
a
greater
general
activity
of
intellect
which
must
necessarily
result
from
even
a
partial
degree
of
cultivation
there
are
here
a
gang
for
that
is
the
honourable
term
of
coopers
of
blacksmiths
of
bricklayers
of
carpenters
all
well
acquainted
with
their
peculiar
trades
the
latter
constructed
the
stands
clothes
presses
sofas
tables
c
with
which
our
house
is
furnished
and
they
are
very
neat
pieces
of
workmanship
neither
veneered
or
polished
indeed
nor
of
very
costly
materials
but
of
the
white
pine
wood
planed
as
smooth
as
marble
a
species
of
furniture
not
very
luxurious
perhaps
but
all
the
better
adapted
therefore
to
the
house
itself
which
is
certainly
rather
more
devoid
of
the
conveniences
and
adornments
of
modern
existence
than
anything
i
ever
took
up
my
abode
in
before
it
consists
of
three
small
rooms
and
three
still
smaller
which
would
be
more
appropriately
designated
as
closets
a
wooden
recess
by
way
of
pantry
and
a
kitchen
detached
from
the
dwelling
a
mere
wooden
outhouse
with
no
floor
but
the
bare
earth
and
for
furniture
a
congregation
of
filthy
negroes
who
lounge
in
and
out
of
it
like
hungry
hounds
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
picking
up
such
scraps
of
food
as
they
can
find
about
which
they
discuss
squatting
down
upon
their
hams
in
which
interesting
position
and
occupation
i
generally
find
a
number
of
them
whenever
i
have
sufficient
hardihood
to
venture
within
those
precincts
the
sight
of
which
and
its
tenants
is
enough
to
slacken
the
appetite
of
the
hungriest
hunter
that
ever
lost
all
nice
regards
in
the
mere
animal
desire
for
food
of
our
three
apartments
one
is
our
sitting
eating
and
room
and
is
sixteen
feet
by
fifteen
the
walls
are
plastered
indeed
but
neither
painted
nor
papered
it
is
divided
from
our
a
similarly
elegant
and
comfortable
chamber
by
a
dingy
wooden
partition
covered
all
over
with
hooks
pegs
and
nails
to
which
hats
caps
keys
are
suspended
in
graceful
irregularity
the
doors
open
by
wooden
latches
raised
by
means
of
small
bits
of
packthread
i
imagine
the
same
primitive
order
of
fastening
celebrated
in
the
touching
chronicle
of
red
riding
hood
how
they
shut
i
will
not
pretend
to
describe
as
the
shutting
of
a
door
is
a
process
of
extremely
rare
occurrence
throughout
the
whole
southern
country
the
third
room
a
chamber
with
sloping
ceiling
immediately
over
our
and
under
the
roof
is
appropriated
to
the
nurse
and
my
two
babies
of
the
closets
one
is
the
overseer
the
other
his
office
or
place
of
business
and
the
third
adjoining
our
and
opening
immediately
out
of
doors
is
dressing
room
and
cabinet
where
he
gives
audiences
to
the
negroes
redresses
grievances
distributes
red
woollen
caps
a
singular
gratification
to
a
slave
shaves
himself
and
performs
the
other
offices
of
his
toilet
such
being
our
abode
i
think
you
will
allow
there
is
little
danger
of
my
being
dazzled
by
the
luxurious
splendours
of
a
southern
slave
residence
our
sole
mode
of
summoning
our
attendants
is
by
a
packthread
suspended
in
the
from
the
we
have
to
raise
the
windows
and
our
voices
and
bring
them
by
power
of
lungs
or
help
ourselves
which
i
thank
god
was
never
yet
a
hardship
to
me
i
mentioned
to
you
just
now
that
two
of
the
carpenters
had
made
a
boat
in
their
leisure
time
i
must
explain
this
to
you
and
this
will
involve
the
mention
of
another
of
miss
martineau
mistakes
with
regard
to
slave
labour
at
least
in
many
parts
of
the
southern
states
she
mentions
that
on
one
estate
of
which
she
knew
the
proprietor
had
made
the
experiment
and
very
successfully
of
appointing
to
each
of
his
slaves
a
certain
task
to
be
performed
in
the
day
which
once
accomplished
no
matter
how
early
the
rest
of
the
four
and
twenty
hours
were
allowed
to
the
labourer
to
employ
as
he
pleased
she
mentions
this
as
a
single
experiment
and
rejoices
over
it
as
a
decided
amelioration
in
the
condition
of
the
slave
and
one
deserving
of
general
adoption
but
in
the
part
of
georgia
where
this
estate
is
situated
the
custom
of
task
labour
is
universal
and
it
prevails
i
believe
throughout
georgia
south
carolina
and
parts
of
north
carolina
in
other
parts
of
the
latter
state
however
as
i
was
informed
by
our
overseer
who
is
a
native
of
that
state
the
estates
are
small
rather
deserving
the
name
of
farms
and
the
labourers
are
much
upon
the
same
footing
as
the
labouring
men
at
the
north
working
from
sunrise
to
sunset
in
the
fields
with
the
farmer
and
his
sons
and
coming
in
with
them
to
their
meals
which
they
take
immediately
after
the
rest
of
the
family
in
louisiana
and
the
new
slave
states
i
believe
task
labour
does
not
prevail
but
it
is
in
those
that
the
condition
of
the
poor
human
cattle
is
most
deplorable
as
you
know
it
was
there
that
the
humane
calculation
was
not
only
made
but
openly
and
unhesitatingly
avowed
that
the
planters
found
it
upon
the
whole
their
most
profitable
plan
to
work
off
kill
with
labour
their
whole
number
of
slaves
about
once
in
seven
years
and
renew
the
whole
stock
by
the
bye
the
jewish
institution
of
slavery
is
much
insisted
upon
by
the
southern
upholders
of
the
system
perhaps
this
is
their
notion
of
the
jewish
jubilee
when
the
slaves
were
by
moses
strict
enactment
to
be
all
set
free
well
this
task
system
is
pursued
on
this
estate
and
thus
it
is
that
the
two
carpenters
were
enabled
to
make
the
boat
they
sold
for
sixty
dollars
these
tasks
of
course
profess
to
be
graduated
according
to
the
sex
age
and
strength
of
the
labourer
but
in
many
instances
this
is
not
the
case
as
i
think
you
will
agree
when
i
tell
you
that
on
first
visit
to
his
estates
he
found
that
the
men
and
the
women
who
laboured
in
the
fields
had
the
same
task
to
perform
this
was
a
noble
admission
of
female
equality
was
it
not
and
thus
it
had
been
on
the
estate
for
many
years
past
of
course
altered
the
distribution
of
the
work
diminishing
the
quantity
done
by
the
women
i
had
a
most
ludicrous
visit
this
morning
from
the
midwife
of
the
estate
rather
an
important
personage
both
to
master
and
slave
as
to
her
unassisted
skill
and
science
the
ushering
of
all
the
young
negroes
into
their
existence
of
bondage
is
entrusted
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
conversation
in
the
adjoining
mine
while
performing
my
own
toilet
and
presently
opened
my
ushering
in
a
dirty
fat
looking
old
negress
saying
midwife
rose
wants
to
make
your
acquaintance
massa
shrieked
out
the
old
creature
in
a
paroxysm
of
admiration
you
get
this
lilly
alablaster
baby
for
a
moment
i
looked
round
to
see
if
she
was
speaking
of
my
baby
but
no
my
dear
this
superlative
apostrophe
was
elicited
by
the
fairness
of
so
much
for
degrees
of
comparison
now
i
suppose
that
if
i
chose
to
walk
arm
in
arm
with
the
dingiest
mulatto
through
the
streets
of
philadelphia
nobody
could
possibly
tell
by
my
complexion
that
i
was
not
his
sister
so
that
the
mere
quality
of
mistress
must
have
had
a
most
miraculous
effect
upon
my
skin
in
the
eyes
of
poor
rose
but
this
species
of
outrageous
flattery
is
as
usual
with
these
people
as
with
the
low
irish
and
arises
from
the
ignorant
desire
common
to
both
the
races
of
propitiating
at
all
costs
the
who
is
to
them
as
a
providence
or
rather
i
should
say
a
fate
for
is
a
heathen
and
no
christian
relationship
soon
after
this
visit
i
was
summoned
into
the
wooden
porch
or
piazza
of
the
house
to
see
a
poor
woman
who
desired
to
speak
to
me
this
was
none
other
than
the
tall
negress
who
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
had
embraced
me
and
my
nurse
with
such
irresistible
zeal
she
appeared
very
ill
and
presently
unfolded
to
me
a
most
distressing
history
of
bodily
afflictions
she
was
the
mother
of
a
very
large
family
and
complained
to
me
that
what
with
and
hard
field
labour
her
back
was
almost
broken
in
two
with
an
almost
savage
vehemence
of
gesticulation
she
suddenly
tore
up
her
scanty
clothing
and
exhibited
a
spectacle
with
which
i
was
inconceivably
shocked
and
sickened
the
facts
without
any
of
her
corroborating
statements
bore
tolerable
witness
to
the
hardships
of
her
existence
i
promised
to
attend
to
her
ailments
and
give
her
proper
remedies
but
these
are
natural
results
inevitable
and
irremediable
ones
of
improper
treatment
of
the
female
frame
and
though
there
may
be
alleviation
there
can
not
be
any
cure
when
once
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
structure
has
been
thus
made
the
victim
of
ignorance
folly
and
wickedness
after
the
departure
of
this
poor
woman
i
walked
down
the
settlement
towards
the
infirmary
or
hospital
calling
in
at
one
or
two
of
the
houses
along
the
row
these
cabins
consist
of
one
room
about
twelve
feet
by
fifteen
with
a
couple
of
closets
smaller
and
closer
than
the
of
a
ship
divided
off
from
the
main
room
and
each
other
by
rough
wooden
partitions
in
which
the
inhabitants
sleep
they
have
almost
all
of
them
a
rude
bedstead
with
the
grey
moss
of
the
forests
for
mattress
and
filthy
blankets
for
covering
two
families
sometimes
eight
and
ten
in
number
reside
in
one
of
these
huts
which
are
mere
wooden
frames
pinned
as
it
were
to
the
earth
by
a
brick
chimney
outside
whose
enormous
aperture
within
pours
down
a
flood
of
air
but
little
counteracted
by
the
miserable
spark
of
fire
which
hardly
sends
an
attenuated
thread
of
lingering
smoke
up
its
huge
throat
a
wide
ditch
runs
immediately
at
the
back
of
these
dwellings
which
is
filled
and
emptied
daily
by
the
tide
attached
to
each
hovel
is
a
small
scrap
of
ground
for
a
garden
which
however
is
for
the
most
part
untended
and
uncultivated
such
of
these
dwellings
as
i
visited
were
filthy
and
wretched
in
the
extreme
and
exhibited
that
most
deplorable
consequence
of
ignorance
and
an
abject
condition
the
inability
of
the
inhabitants
to
secure
and
improve
even
such
pitiful
comfort
as
might
yet
be
achieved
by
them
instead
of
the
order
neatness
and
ingenuity
which
might
convert
even
these
miserable
hovels
into
tolerable
residences
there
was
the
careless
reckless
filthy
indolence
which
even
the
brutes
do
not
exhibit
in
their
lairs
and
nests
and
which
seemed
incapable
of
applying
to
the
uses
of
existence
the
few
miserable
means
of
comfort
yet
within
their
reach
firewood
and
shavings
lay
littered
about
the
floors
while
the
children
were
cowering
round
two
or
three
smouldering
cinders
the
moss
with
which
the
chinks
and
crannies
of
their
dwellings
might
have
been
stuffed
was
trailing
in
dirt
and
dust
about
the
ground
while
the
of
the
huts
opening
upon
a
most
unsightly
ditch
was
left
wide
open
for
the
fowls
and
ducks
which
they
are
allowed
to
raise
to
travel
in
and
out
increasing
the
filth
of
the
cabin
by
what
they
brought
and
left
in
every
direction
in
the
midst
of
the
floor
or
squatting
round
the
cold
hearth
would
be
four
or
five
little
children
from
four
to
ten
years
old
the
latter
all
with
babies
in
their
arms
the
care
of
the
infants
being
taken
from
the
mothers
who
are
driven
as
soon
as
they
recover
from
child
labour
and
devolved
upon
these
poor
little
nurses
as
they
are
called
whose
business
it
is
to
watch
the
infant
and
carry
it
to
its
mother
whenever
it
may
require
nourishment
to
these
hardly
human
little
beings
i
addressed
my
remonstrances
about
the
filth
cold
and
unnecessary
wretchedness
of
their
room
bidding
the
elder
boys
and
girls
kindle
up
the
fire
sweep
the
floor
and
expel
the
poultry
for
a
long
time
my
very
words
seemed
unintelligible
to
them
till
when
i
began
to
sweep
and
make
up
the
fire
they
first
fell
to
laughing
and
then
imitating
me
the
encrustations
of
dirt
on
their
hands
feet
and
faces
were
my
next
object
of
attack
and
the
stupid
negro
practice
by
the
bye
but
a
short
time
since
nearly
universal
in
enlightened
europe
of
keeping
the
babies
with
their
feet
bare
and
their
heads
already
well
capped
by
nature
with
their
woolly
hair
wrapped
in
hot
filthy
coverings
thus
i
travelled
down
the
in
every
dwelling
endeavouring
to
awaken
a
new
perception
that
of
cleanliness
sighing
as
i
went
over
the
futility
of
my
own
exertions
for
how
can
slaves
be
improved
nathless
thought
i
let
what
can
be
done
for
it
may
be
that
the
two
being
incompatible
improvement
may
yet
expel
slavery
and
so
it
might
and
surely
would
if
instead
of
beginning
at
the
end
i
could
but
begin
at
the
beginning
of
my
task
if
the
mind
and
soul
were
awakened
instead
of
mere
physical
good
attempted
the
physical
good
would
result
and
the
great
curse
vanish
away
but
my
hands
are
tied
fast
and
this
corner
of
the
work
is
all
that
i
may
do
yet
it
can
not
be
but
from
my
words
and
actions
some
revelations
should
reach
these
poor
people
and
going
in
and
out
amongst
them
perpetually
i
shall
teach
and
they
learn
involuntarily
a
thousand
things
of
deepest
import
they
must
learn
and
who
can
tell
the
fruit
of
that
knowledge
alone
that
there
are
beings
in
the
world
even
with
skins
of
a
different
colour
from
their
own
who
have
sympathy
for
their
misfortunes
love
for
their
virtues
and
respect
for
their
common
nature
but
oh
my
heart
is
full
almost
to
bursting
as
i
walk
among
these
most
poor
creatures
the
infirmary
is
a
large
building
terminating
the
broad
space
between
the
two
rows
of
houses
which
form
the
first
settlement
it
is
built
of
white
washed
wood
and
contains
four
rooms
but
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
the
spectacle
which
was
presented
to
me
on
my
entering
the
first
of
these
but
half
the
casements
of
which
there
were
six
were
glazed
and
these
were
obscured
with
dirt
almost
as
much
as
the
other
windowless
ones
were
darkened
by
the
dingy
shutters
which
the
shivering
inmates
had
fastened
to
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
the
cold
in
the
enormous
chimney
glimmered
the
powerless
embers
of
a
few
sticks
of
wood
round
which
however
as
many
of
the
sick
women
as
could
approach
were
cowering
some
on
wooden
settles
most
of
them
on
the
ground
excluding
those
who
were
too
ill
to
rise
and
these
last
poor
wretches
lay
prostrate
on
the
floor
without
bed
mattress
or
pillow
buried
in
tattered
and
filthy
blankets
which
huddled
round
them
as
they
lay
strewed
about
left
hardly
space
to
move
upon
the
floor
and
here
in
their
hour
of
sickness
and
suffering
lay
those
whose
health
and
strength
are
spent
in
unrequited
labour
for
us
those
who
perhaps
even
yesterday
were
being
urged
onto
their
unpaid
task
those
whose
husbands
fathers
brothers
and
sons
were
even
at
that
hour
sweating
over
the
earth
whose
produce
was
to
buy
for
us
all
the
luxuries
which
health
can
revel
in
all
the
comforts
which
can
alleviate
sickness
i
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
perfectly
unable
to
speak
the
tears
pouring
from
my
eyes
at
this
sad
spectacle
of
their
misery
myself
and
my
emotion
alike
strange
and
incomprehensible
to
them
here
lay
women
expecting
every
hour
the
terrors
and
agonies
of
others
who
had
just
brought
their
doomed
offspring
into
the
world
others
who
were
groaning
over
the
anguish
and
bitter
disappointment
of
miscarriages
here
lay
some
burning
with
fever
others
chilled
with
cold
and
aching
with
rheumatism
upon
the
hard
cold
ground
the
draughts
and
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
increasing
their
sufferings
and
dirt
noise
and
stench
and
every
aggravation
of
which
sickness
is
capable
combined
in
their
condition
here
they
lay
like
brute
beasts
absorbed
in
physical
suffering
unvisited
by
any
of
those
divine
influences
which
may
ennoble
the
dispensations
of
pain
and
illness
forsaken
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
all
good
and
yet
o
god
thou
surely
hadst
not
forsaken
them
now
pray
take
notice
that
this
is
the
hospital
of
an
estate
where
the
owners
are
supposed
to
be
humane
the
overseer
efficient
and
kind
and
the
negroes
remarkably
well
cared
for
and
comfortable
as
soon
as
i
recovered
from
my
dismay
i
addressed
old
rose
the
midwife
who
had
charge
of
this
room
bidding
her
open
the
shutters
of
such
windows
as
were
glazed
and
let
in
the
light
i
next
proceeded
to
make
up
the
fire
but
upon
my
lifting
a
log
for
that
purpose
there
was
one
universal
outcry
of
horror
and
old
rose
attempting
to
snatch
it
from
me
exclaimed
alone
missis
let
be
what
for
you
lift
wood
you
have
nigger
enough
missis
to
do
it
i
hereupon
had
to
explain
to
them
my
view
of
the
purposes
for
which
hands
and
arms
were
appended
to
our
bodies
and
forthwith
began
making
rose
tidy
up
the
miserable
apartment
removing
all
the
filth
and
rubbish
from
the
floor
that
could
be
removed
folding
up
in
piles
the
blankets
of
the
patients
who
were
not
using
them
and
placing
in
rather
more
sheltered
and
comfortable
positions
those
who
were
unable
to
rise
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
and
having
enforced
upon
them
all
my
earnest
desire
that
they
should
keep
their
room
swept
and
as
tidy
as
possible
i
passed
on
to
the
other
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
to
the
two
above
one
of
which
is
appropriated
to
the
use
of
the
men
who
are
ill
they
were
all
in
the
same
deplorable
condition
the
upper
rooms
being
rather
the
more
miserable
inasmuch
as
none
of
the
windows
were
glazed
at
all
and
they
had
therefore
only
the
alternative
of
utter
darkness
or
killing
draughts
of
air
from
the
unsheltered
casements
in
all
filth
disorder
and
misery
abounded
the
floor
was
the
only
bed
and
scanty
begrimed
rags
of
blankets
the
only
covering
i
left
this
refuge
for
sick
dependants
with
my
clothes
covered
with
dust
and
full
of
vermin
and
with
a
heart
heavy
enough
as
you
will
well
believe
my
morning
work
had
fatigued
me
not
a
little
and
i
was
glad
to
return
to
the
house
where
i
gave
vent
to
my
indignation
and
regret
at
the
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
to
and
his
overseer
who
here
is
a
member
of
our
family
the
latter
told
me
that
the
condition
of
the
hospital
had
appeared
to
him
from
his
first
entering
upon
his
situation
only
within
the
last
year
to
require
a
reform
and
that
he
had
proposed
it
to
the
former
manager
k
and
brother
who
is
part
proprietor
of
the
estate
but
receiving
no
encouragement
from
them
had
supposed
that
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
owners
and
had
left
it
in
the
condition
in
which
he
had
found
it
in
which
condition
it
has
been
for
the
last
nineteen
years
and
upwards
this
new
overseer
of
ours
has
lived
fourteen
years
with
an
old
scotch
gentleman
who
owns
an
estate
adjoining
on
the
island
of
simons
upon
which
estate
from
everything
i
can
gather
and
from
what
i
know
of
the
proprietor
character
the
slaves
are
probably
treated
with
as
much
humanity
as
is
consistent
with
slavery
at
all
and
where
the
management
and
comfort
of
the
hospital
in
particular
had
been
most
carefully
and
judiciously
attended
to
with
regard
to
the
indifference
of
our
former
manager
upon
the
subject
of
the
accommodation
for
the
sick
he
was
an
excellent
overseer
the
estate
returned
a
full
income
under
his
management
and
such
men
have
nothing
to
do
with
sick
slaves
they
are
tools
to
be
mended
only
if
they
can
be
made
available
again
if
not
to
be
flung
by
as
useless
without
further
expense
of
money
time
or
trouble
i
am
learning
to
row
here
for
circumscribed
as
my
walks
necessarily
are
impossible
as
it
is
to
resort
to
my
favourite
exercise
on
horseback
upon
these
narrow
dykes
i
must
do
something
to
prevent
my
blood
from
stagnating
and
this
broad
brimming
river
and
the
beautiful
light
canoes
which
lie
moored
at
the
steps
are
very
inviting
persuaders
to
this
species
of
exercise
my
first
attempt
was
confined
to
pulling
an
oar
across
the
stream
for
which
i
rejoiced
in
sundry
aches
and
pains
altogether
novel
letting
alone
a
delightful
row
of
blisters
on
each
of
my
hands
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
in
the
hospital
were
several
sick
babies
whose
mothers
were
permitted
to
suspend
their
field
labour
in
order
to
nurse
them
upon
addressing
some
remonstrances
to
one
of
these
who
besides
having
a
sick
child
was
ill
herself
about
the
horribly
dirty
condition
of
her
baby
she
assured
me
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
keep
their
children
clean
that
they
went
out
to
work
at
daybreak
and
did
not
get
their
tasks
done
till
evening
and
that
then
they
were
too
tired
and
worn
out
to
do
anything
but
throw
themselves
down
and
sleep
this
statement
of
hers
i
mentioned
on
my
return
from
the
hospital
and
the
overseer
appeared
extremely
annoyed
by
it
and
assured
me
repeatedly
that
it
was
not
true
in
the
evening
who
had
been
over
to
darien
mentioned
that
one
of
the
storekeepers
there
had
told
him
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
he
had
paid
the
negroes
of
this
estate
several
thousand
dollars
for
moss
which
is
a
very
profitable
article
of
traffic
with
them
they
collect
it
from
the
trees
dry
and
pick
it
and
then
sell
it
to
the
people
in
darien
for
mattresses
sofas
and
all
sorts
of
stuffing
purposes
which
in
my
opinion
it
answers
better
than
any
other
material
whatever
that
i
am
acquainted
with
being
as
light
as
horse
hair
as
springy
and
elastic
and
a
great
deal
less
harsh
and
rigid
it
is
now
dear
e
and
i
doubt
not
it
has
been
sleepy
time
with
you
over
this
letter
long
ere
you
came
thus
far
there
is
a
preliminary
to
my
repose
however
in
this
agreeable
residence
which
i
rather
dread
namely
the
hunting
for
or
discovering
without
hunting
in
fine
relief
upon
the
walls
of
my
a
most
hideous
and
detestable
species
of
called
centipedes
which
come
out
of
the
cracks
and
crevices
of
the
walls
and
fill
my
very
heart
with
dismay
they
are
from
an
inch
to
two
inches
long
and
appear
to
have
not
a
hundred
but
a
thousand
legs
i
can
not
ascertain
very
certainly
from
the
negroes
whether
they
sting
or
not
but
they
look
exceedingly
as
if
they
might
and
i
visit
my
babies
every
night
in
fear
and
tremblings
lest
i
should
find
one
or
more
of
these
hateful
creatures
mounting
guard
over
them
good
night
you
are
well
to
be
free
from
centipedes
better
to
be
free
from
slaves
dear
e
this
morning
i
paid
my
second
visit
to
the
infirmary
and
found
there
had
been
some
faint
attempt
at
sweeping
and
cleaning
in
compliance
with
my
entreaties
the
poor
woman
harriet
however
whose
statement
with
regard
to
the
impossibility
of
their
attending
properly
to
their
children
had
been
so
vehemently
denied
by
the
overseer
was
crying
bitterly
i
asked
her
what
ailed
her
when
more
by
signs
and
dumb
show
than
words
she
and
old
rose
informed
me
that
o
had
flogged
her
that
morning
for
having
told
me
that
the
women
had
not
time
to
keep
their
children
clean
it
is
part
of
the
regular
duty
of
every
overseer
to
visit
the
infirmary
at
least
once
a
day
which
he
generally
does
in
the
morning
and
o
visit
had
preceded
mine
but
a
short
time
only
or
i
might
have
been
edified
by
seeing
a
man
horsewhip
a
woman
i
again
and
again
made
her
repeat
her
story
and
she
again
and
again
affirmed
that
she
had
been
flogged
for
what
she
told
me
none
of
the
whole
company
in
the
room
denying
it
or
contradicting
her
i
left
the
room
because
i
was
so
disgusted
and
indignant
that
i
could
hardly
restrain
my
feelings
and
to
express
them
could
have
produced
no
single
good
result
in
the
next
ward
stretched
upon
the
ground
apparently
either
asleep
or
so
overcome
with
sickness
as
to
be
incapable
of
moving
lay
an
immense
woman
her
stature
as
she
cumbered
the
earth
must
have
been
i
should
think
five
feet
seven
or
eight
and
her
bulk
enormous
she
was
wrapped
in
filthy
rags
and
lay
with
her
face
on
the
floor
as
i
approached
and
stooped
to
see
what
ailed
her
she
suddenly
threw
out
her
arms
and
seized
with
violent
convulsions
rolled
over
and
over
upon
the
floor
beating
her
head
violently
upon
the
ground
and
throwing
her
enormous
limbs
about
in
a
horrible
manner
immediately
upon
the
occurrence
of
this
fit
four
or
five
women
threw
themselves
literally
upon
her
and
held
her
down
by
main
force
they
even
proceeded
to
bind
her
legs
and
arms
together
to
prevent
her
dashing
herself
about
but
this
violent
coercion
and
tight
bandaging
seemed
to
me
in
my
profound
ignorance
more
likely
to
increase
her
illness
by
impeding
her
breathing
and
the
circulation
of
her
blood
and
i
bade
them
desist
and
unfasten
all
the
strings
and
ligatures
not
only
that
they
had
put
round
her
limbs
but
which
by
tightening
her
clothes
round
her
body
caused
any
obstruction
how
much
i
wished
that
instead
of
music
and
dancing
and
such
stuff
i
had
learned
something
of
sickness
and
health
of
the
conditions
and
liabilities
of
the
human
body
that
i
might
have
known
how
to
assist
this
poor
creature
and
to
direct
her
ignorant
and
helpless
nurses
the
fit
presently
subsided
and
was
succeeded
by
the
most
deplorable
prostration
and
weakness
of
nerves
the
tears
streaming
down
the
poor
woman
cheeks
in
showers
without
however
her
uttering
a
single
word
though
she
moaned
incessantly
after
bathing
her
forehead
hands
and
chest
with
vinegar
we
raised
her
up
and
i
sent
to
the
house
for
a
chair
with
a
back
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
hospital
and
we
contrived
to
place
her
in
it
i
have
seldom
seen
finer
women
than
this
poor
creature
and
her
younger
sister
an
immense
strapping
lass
called
chloe
tall
straight
and
extremely
well
made
who
was
assisting
her
sister
and
whom
i
had
remarked
for
the
extreme
delight
and
merriment
which
my
cleansing
propensities
seemed
to
give
her
on
my
last
visit
to
the
hospital
she
was
here
taking
care
of
a
sick
baby
and
helping
to
nurse
her
sister
molly
who
it
seems
is
subject
to
those
fits
about
which
i
spoke
to
our
physician
here
an
intelligent
man
residing
in
darien
who
visits
the
estate
whenever
medical
assistance
is
required
he
seemed
to
attribute
them
to
nervous
disorder
brought
on
by
frequent
child
bearing
this
woman
is
young
i
suppose
at
the
outside
not
thirty
and
her
sister
informed
me
that
she
had
had
ten
children
ten
children
e
fits
and
hard
labour
in
the
fields
unpaid
labour
labour
exacted
with
stripes
how
do
you
fancy
that
i
wonder
if
my
mere
narration
can
make
your
blood
boil
as
the
facts
did
mine
among
the
patients
in
this
room
was
a
young
girl
apparently
from
fourteen
to
fifteen
whose
hands
and
feet
were
literally
rotting
away
piecemeal
from
the
effect
of
a
horrible
disease
to
which
the
negroes
are
subject
here
and
i
believe
in
the
west
indies
and
when
it
attacks
the
joints
of
the
toes
and
fingers
the
pieces
absolutely
decay
and
come
off
leaving
the
limb
a
maimed
and
horrible
stump
i
believe
no
cure
is
known
for
this
disgusting
malady
which
seems
confined
to
these
poor
creatures
another
disease
of
which
they
complained
much
and
which
of
course
i
was
utterly
incapable
of
accounting
for
was
a
species
of
to
which
their
babies
very
frequently
fall
victims
in
the
first
or
second
week
after
their
birth
refusing
the
breast
and
the
mouth
gradually
losing
the
power
of
opening
itself
the
horrible
diseased
state
of
head
common
among
their
babies
is
a
mere
result
of
filth
and
confinement
and
therefore
though
i
never
anywhere
saw
such
distressing
and
disgusting
objects
as
some
of
these
poor
little
woolly
skulls
presented
the
cause
was
sufficiently
obvious
pleurisy
or
a
tendency
to
it
seems
very
common
among
them
also
or
inflammation
of
the
lungs
which
is
terribly
prevalent
and
generally
fatal
rheumatism
is
almost
universal
and
as
it
proceeds
from
exposure
and
want
of
knowledge
and
care
attacks
indiscriminately
the
young
and
old
a
great
number
of
the
women
are
victims
to
falling
of
the
womb
and
weakness
in
the
spine
but
these
are
necessary
results
of
their
laborious
existence
and
do
not
belong
either
to
climate
or
constitution
i
have
ingeniously
contrived
to
introduce
bribery
corruption
and
pauperism
all
in
a
breath
upon
this
island
which
until
my
advent
was
as
innocent
of
these
pollutions
i
suppose
as
prospero
isle
of
refuge
wishing
however
to
appeal
to
some
perception
perhaps
a
little
less
dim
in
their
minds
than
the
abstract
loveliness
of
cleanliness
i
have
proclaimed
to
all
the
little
baby
nurses
that
i
will
give
a
cent
to
every
little
boy
or
girl
whose
baby
face
shall
be
clean
and
one
to
every
individual
with
clean
face
and
hands
of
their
own
my
appeal
was
fully
comprehended
by
the
majority
it
seems
for
this
morning
i
was
surrounded
as
soon
as
i
came
out
by
a
swarm
of
children
carrying
their
little
charges
on
their
backs
and
in
their
arms
the
shining
and
in
many
instances
wet
faces
and
hands
of
the
latter
bearing
ample
testimony
to
the
ablutions
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
them
how
they
will
curse
me
and
the
copper
cause
of
all
their
woes
in
their
baby
bosoms
do
you
know
that
little
as
grown
negroes
are
admirable
for
their
personal
beauty
in
my
opinion
at
least
the
black
babies
of
a
year
or
two
old
are
very
pretty
they
have
for
the
most
part
beautiful
eyes
and
eyelashes
the
pearly
perfect
teeth
which
they
retain
after
their
other
juvenile
graces
have
left
them
their
skins
are
all
i
mean
of
blacks
generally
infinitely
finer
and
softer
than
the
skins
of
white
people
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
among
the
white
race
the
skins
generally
belong
to
persons
of
dark
complexion
this
as
a
characteristic
of
the
black
race
i
think
might
be
accepted
as
some
compensation
for
the
coarse
woolly
hair
the
nose
and
mouth
which
are
so
peculiarly
displeasing
in
their
conformation
in
the
face
of
a
negro
man
or
woman
being
the
features
least
developed
in
a
baby
countenance
do
not
at
first
present
the
ugliness
which
they
assume
as
they
become
more
marked
and
when
the
very
unusual
operation
of
washing
has
been
performed
the
blood
shines
through
the
fine
texture
of
the
skin
giving
life
and
richness
to
the
dingy
colour
and
displaying
a
species
of
beauty
which
i
think
scarcely
any
body
who
observed
it
would
fail
to
acknowledge
i
have
seen
many
babies
on
this
plantation
who
were
quite
as
pretty
as
white
children
and
this
very
day
stooped
to
kiss
a
little
sleeping
creature
that
lay
on
its
mother
knees
in
the
infirmary
as
beautiful
a
specimen
of
a
sleeping
infant
as
i
ever
saw
the
caress
excited
the
irrepressible
delight
of
all
the
women
present
poor
creatures
who
seemed
to
forget
that
i
was
a
woman
and
had
children
myself
and
bore
a
woman
and
a
mother
heart
towards
them
and
theirs
but
indeed
the
honourable
slumkey
could
not
have
achieved
more
popularity
by
his
performances
in
that
line
than
i
by
this
exhibition
of
feeling
and
had
the
question
been
my
election
i
am
very
sure
nobody
else
would
have
had
a
chance
of
a
vote
through
the
island
but
wisely
is
it
said
that
use
is
second
nature
and
the
contempt
and
neglect
to
which
these
poor
people
are
used
make
the
commonest
expression
of
human
sympathy
appear
a
boon
and
gracious
condescension
while
i
am
speaking
of
the
negro
countenance
there
is
another
beauty
which
is
not
at
all
unfrequent
among
those
i
see
here
a
finely
shaped
oval
face
and
those
who
know
as
all
painters
and
sculptors
all
who
understand
beauty
do
how
much
expression
there
is
in
the
outline
of
the
head
and
how
very
rare
it
is
to
see
a
face
will
be
apt
to
consider
this
a
higher
matter
than
any
colouring
of
which
indeed
the
red
and
white
one
so
often
admired
is
by
no
means
the
most
rich
picturesque
or
expressive
at
first
the
dark
colour
confounded
all
features
to
my
eye
and
i
could
hardly
tell
one
face
from
another
becoming
however
accustomed
to
the
complexion
i
now
perceive
all
the
variety
among
these
black
countenances
that
there
is
among
our
own
race
and
as
much
difference
in
features
and
in
expression
as
among
the
same
number
of
whites
there
is
another
peculiarity
which
i
have
remarked
among
the
women
here
very
considerable
beauty
in
the
make
of
the
hands
their
feet
are
very
generally
ill
made
which
must
be
a
natural
and
not
an
acquired
defect
as
they
seldom
injure
their
feet
by
wearing
shoes
the
figures
of
some
of
the
women
are
handsome
and
their
carriage
from
the
absence
of
any
confining
or
tightening
clothing
and
the
habit
they
have
of
balancing
great
weights
on
their
heads
erect
and
good
at
the
upper
end
of
the
row
of
houses
and
nearest
to
our
residence
is
the
hut
of
the
head
driver
let
me
explain
by
the
way
his
office
the
negroes
as
i
before
told
you
are
divided
into
troops
or
gangs
as
they
are
called
at
the
head
of
each
gang
is
a
driver
who
stands
over
them
whip
in
hand
while
they
perform
their
daily
task
who
renders
an
account
of
each
individual
slave
and
his
work
every
evening
to
the
overseer
and
receives
from
him
directions
for
their
next
day
tasks
each
driver
is
allowed
to
inflict
a
dozen
lashes
upon
any
refractory
slave
in
the
field
and
at
the
time
of
the
offence
they
may
not
however
extend
the
chastisement
and
if
it
is
found
ineffectual
their
remedy
lies
in
reporting
the
unmanageable
individual
either
to
the
head
driver
or
the
overseer
the
former
of
whom
has
power
to
inflict
three
dozen
lashes
at
his
own
discretion
and
the
latter
as
many
as
he
himself
sees
fit
within
the
number
of
fifty
which
limit
however
i
must
tell
you
is
an
arbitrary
one
on
this
plantation
appointed
by
the
founder
of
the
estate
major
grandfather
many
of
whose
regulations
indeed
i
believe
most
of
them
are
still
observed
in
the
government
of
the
plantation
limits
of
this
sort
however
to
the
power
of
either
driver
head
driver
or
overseer
may
or
may
not
exist
elsewhere
they
are
to
a
certain
degree
a
check
upon
the
power
of
these
individuals
but
in
the
absence
of
the
master
the
overseer
may
confine
himself
within
the
limit
or
not
as
he
chooses
and
as
for
the
master
himself
where
is
his
limit
he
may
if
he
likes
flog
a
slave
to
death
for
the
laws
which
pretend
that
he
may
not
are
a
mere
pretence
inasmuch
as
the
testimony
of
a
black
is
never
taken
against
a
white
and
upon
this
plantation
of
ours
and
a
thousand
more
the
overseer
is
the
white
man
so
whence
should
come
the
testimony
to
any
crime
of
his
with
regard
to
the
statement
that
it
is
not
the
owner
interest
to
destroy
his
human
property
it
answers
nothing
the
instances
in
which
men
to
gratify
the
immediate
impulse
of
passion
sacrifice
not
only
their
eternal
but
their
evident
palpable
positive
worldly
interest
are
infinite
nothing
is
commoner
than
for
a
man
under
the
transient
influence
of
anger
to
disregard
his
worldly
advantage
and
the
black
slave
whose
preservation
is
indeed
supposed
to
be
his
owner
interest
may
be
will
be
and
is
occasionally
sacrificed
to
the
blind
impulse
of
passion
to
return
to
our
head
driver
or
as
he
is
familiarly
called
head
man
frank
he
is
second
in
authority
only
to
the
overseer
and
exercises
rule
alike
over
the
drivers
and
the
gangs
in
the
absence
of
the
sovereign
white
man
from
the
estate
which
happens
whenever
o
visits
the
other
two
plantations
at
woodville
and
simons
he
is
sole
master
and
governor
of
the
island
appoints
the
work
pronounces
punishments
gives
permission
to
the
men
to
leave
the
island
without
it
they
never
may
do
so
and
exercises
all
functions
of
undisputed
mastery
over
his
fellow
slaves
for
you
will
observe
that
all
this
while
he
is
just
as
much
a
slave
as
any
of
the
rest
trustworthy
upright
intelligent
he
may
be
flogged
if
o
or
so
please
it
and
sold
the
next
day
like
a
cart
horse
at
the
will
of
the
latter
besides
his
various
other
responsibilities
he
has
the
key
of
all
the
stores
and
gives
out
the
people
rations
weekly
nor
is
it
only
the
people
provisions
that
are
put
under
his
charge
meat
which
is
only
given
out
to
them
occasionally
and
provisions
for
the
use
of
the
family
are
also
entrusted
to
his
care
thus
you
see
among
these
creatures
their
own
masters
yet
look
to
find
surviving
all
their
best
efforts
to
destroy
them
good
sense
honesty
and
all
the
qualities
mental
and
moral
that
make
one
man
worthy
to
be
trusted
by
another
from
the
imperceptible
but
inevitable
effect
of
the
sympathies
and
influences
of
human
creatures
towards
and
over
each
other
frank
intelligence
has
become
uncommonly
developed
by
intimate
communion
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
with
the
former
overseer
a
very
intelligent
man
who
has
only
just
left
the
estate
after
managing
it
for
nineteen
years
the
effect
of
this
intercourse
and
of
the
trust
and
responsibility
laid
upon
the
man
are
that
he
is
well
judging
active
intelligent
extremely
well
mannered
and
being
respected
he
respects
himself
he
is
as
ignorant
as
the
rest
of
the
slaves
but
he
is
always
clean
and
tidy
in
his
person
with
a
courteousness
of
demeanour
far
removed
from
servility
and
exhibits
a
strong
instance
of
the
intolerable
and
wicked
injustice
of
the
system
under
which
he
lives
having
advanced
thus
far
towards
improvement
in
spite
of
all
the
bars
it
puts
to
progress
and
here
being
arrested
not
by
want
of
energy
want
of
sense
or
any
want
of
his
own
but
by
being
held
as
another
man
property
who
can
only
thus
hold
him
by
forbidding
him
further
improvement
when
i
see
that
man
who
keeps
himself
a
good
deal
aloof
from
the
rest
in
his
leisure
hours
looking
with
a
countenance
of
deep
thought
as
i
did
over
the
broad
river
which
is
to
him
as
a
prison
wall
to
the
fields
and
forest
beyond
not
one
inch
or
branch
of
which
his
utmost
industry
can
conquer
as
his
own
or
acquire
and
leave
an
independent
heritage
to
his
children
i
marvel
what
the
thoughts
of
such
a
man
may
be
i
was
in
his
house
and
the
same
superiority
in
cleanliness
comfort
and
propriety
exhibited
itself
in
his
dwelling
as
in
his
own
personal
appearance
and
that
of
his
wife
a
most
active
trustworthy
excellent
woman
daughter
of
the
oldest
and
probably
most
highly
respected
of
all
slaves
to
the
excellent
conduct
of
this
woman
and
indeed
every
member
of
her
family
both
the
present
and
the
last
overseer
bear
unqualified
testimony
as
i
was
returning
towards
the
house
after
my
long
morning
lounge
a
man
rushed
out
of
the
blacksmith
shop
and
catching
me
by
the
skirt
of
my
gown
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
on
having
at
length
found
the
missis
they
have
no
idea
of
course
of
a
white
person
performing
any
of
the
offices
of
a
servant
and
as
throughout
the
whole
southern
country
the
owner
children
are
nursed
and
tended
and
sometimes
by
their
slaves
i
wonder
how
this
inferior
milk
agrees
with
the
lordly
babies
the
appearance
of
m
with
my
two
children
had
immediately
suggested
the
idea
that
she
must
be
the
missis
many
of
the
poor
negroes
flocked
to
her
paying
their
profound
homage
under
this
impression
and
when
she
explained
to
them
that
she
was
not
their
wife
the
confusion
in
their
minds
seemed
very
great
heaven
only
knows
whether
they
did
not
conclude
that
they
had
two
mistresses
and
two
wives
for
the
privileged
race
must
seem
in
their
eyes
to
have
such
absolute
masterdom
on
earth
that
perhaps
they
thought
polygamy
might
be
one
of
the
sovereign
white
men
numerous
indulgences
the
ecstacy
of
the
blacksmith
on
discovering
the
missis
at
last
was
very
funny
and
was
expressed
with
such
extraordinary
grimaces
contortions
and
gesticulations
that
i
thought
i
should
have
died
of
laughing
at
this
rapturous
identification
of
my
most
melancholy
relation
to
the
poor
fellow
having
at
length
extricated
myself
from
the
group
which
forms
round
me
whenever
i
stop
but
for
a
few
minutes
i
pursued
my
voyage
of
discovery
by
peeping
into
the
kitchen
garden
i
dared
do
no
more
the
aspect
of
the
place
would
have
rejoiced
the
very
soul
of
solomon
sluggard
of
old
a
few
cabbages
and
weeds
innumerable
filled
the
neglected
looking
enclosure
and
i
ventured
no
further
than
the
entrance
into
its
most
uninviting
precincts
you
are
to
understand
that
upon
this
swamp
island
of
ours
we
have
quite
a
large
stock
of
cattle
cows
sheep
pigs
and
poultry
in
the
most
enormous
and
inconvenient
abundance
the
cows
are
pretty
miserably
off
for
pasture
the
banks
and
pathways
of
the
dykes
being
their
only
grazing
ground
which
the
sheep
perambulate
also
in
earnest
search
of
a
nibble
of
fresh
herbage
both
the
cows
and
sheep
are
fed
with
rice
flour
in
great
abundance
and
are
pretty
often
carried
down
for
change
of
air
and
more
sufficient
grazing
to
hampton
estate
on
the
island
of
simons
fifteen
miles
from
this
place
further
down
the
river
or
rather
indeed
i
should
say
in
the
sea
for
is
salt
water
all
round
and
one
end
of
the
island
has
a
noble
beach
open
to
the
vast
atlantic
the
pigs
thrive
admirably
here
and
attain
very
great
perfection
of
size
and
flavour
the
rice
flour
upon
which
they
are
chiefly
fed
tending
to
make
them
very
delicate
as
for
the
poultry
it
being
one
of
the
few
privileges
of
the
poor
blacks
to
raise
as
many
as
they
can
their
abundance
is
literally
a
nuisance
ducks
fowls
pigeons
turkeys
the
two
latter
species
by
the
bye
are
exclusively
the
master
property
cluck
scream
gabble
gobble
crow
cackle
fight
fly
and
flutter
in
all
directions
and
to
their
immense
concourse
and
the
perfect
freedom
with
which
they
intrude
themselves
even
into
the
piazza
of
the
house
the
pantry
and
kitchen
i
partly
attribute
the
swarms
of
fleas
and
other
still
less
agreeable
vermin
with
which
we
are
most
horribly
pestered
my
walk
lay
along
the
bank
of
a
canal
which
has
been
dug
through
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
island
to
render
more
direct
and
easy
the
transportation
of
the
rice
from
one
end
of
the
estate
to
another
or
from
the
various
distant
fields
to
the
principal
mill
at
settlement
no
it
is
of
considerable
width
and
depth
and
opens
by
various
locks
into
the
river
it
has
unfortunately
no
trees
on
its
banks
but
a
good
footpath
renders
it
in
spite
of
that
deficiency
about
the
best
walk
on
the
island
i
passed
again
one
of
those
beautiful
evergreen
thickets
which
i
described
to
you
in
my
last
letter
it
is
called
a
reserve
and
is
kept
uncleared
and
uncultivated
in
its
natural
swampy
condition
to
allow
of
the
people
procuring
their
firewood
from
it
i
can
not
get
accustomed
so
as
to
be
indifferent
to
this
exquisite
natural
ornamental
growth
and
think
as
i
contemplate
the
various
and
beautiful
foliage
of
these
watery
woods
how
many
of
our
finest
english
parks
and
gardens
owe
their
chiefest
adornments
to
plantations
of
these
shrubs
procured
at
immense
cost
reared
with
infinite
pains
and
care
which
are
here
basking
in
the
winter
sunshine
waiting
to
be
cut
down
for
firewood
these
little
groves
are
peopled
with
wild
pigeons
and
birds
which
they
designate
here
as
blackbirds
these
sometimes
rise
from
the
rice
fields
with
a
whirr
of
multitudinous
wings
that
is
almost
startling
and
positively
overshadow
the
ground
beneath
like
a
cloud
i
had
a
conversation
that
interested
me
a
good
deal
during
my
walk
with
my
peculiar
slave
jack
this
lad
whom
has
appointed
to
attend
me
in
my
roamings
about
the
island
and
rowing
expeditions
on
the
river
is
the
son
of
the
last
head
driver
a
man
of
very
extraordinary
intelligence
and
faithfulness
such
at
least
is
the
account
given
of
him
by
his
employers
in
the
of
the
negroes
is
a
stone
dedicated
to
his
memory
a
mark
of
distinction
accorded
by
his
masters
which
his
son
never
failed
to
point
out
to
me
when
we
passed
that
way
jack
appears
to
inherit
his
quickness
of
apprehension
his
questions
like
those
of
an
intelligent
child
are
absolutely
inexhaustible
his
curiosity
about
all
things
beyond
this
island
the
of
his
existence
is
perfectly
intense
his
countenance
is
very
pleasing
mild
and
not
otherwise
than
thoughtful
he
is
in
common
with
the
rest
of
them
a
stupendous
flatterer
and
like
the
rest
of
them
also
seems
devoid
of
physical
and
moral
courage
in
the
midst
of
his
torrent
of
enquiries
about
places
and
things
i
suddenly
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
be
free
a
gleam
of
light
absolutely
shot
over
his
whole
countenance
like
the
vivid
and
instantaneous
lightning
he
stammered
hesitated
became
excessively
confused
and
at
length
replied
missis
what
for
me
wish
to
be
free
oh
no
missis
me
no
wish
to
be
free
if
massa
only
let
we
keep
pig
the
fear
of
offending
by
uttering
that
forbidden
wish
the
dread
of
admitting
by
its
expression
the
slightest
discontent
with
his
present
situation
the
desire
to
conciliate
my
favour
even
at
the
expense
of
strangling
the
intense
natural
longing
that
absolutely
glowed
in
his
every
feature
it
was
a
sad
spectacle
and
i
repented
my
question
as
for
the
pitiful
request
which
he
reiterated
several
times
adding
missis
me
no
want
to
be
free
me
work
till
me
die
for
missis
and
massa
with
increased
emphasis
it
amounted
only
to
this
that
the
negroes
once
were
but
no
longer
are
permitted
to
keep
pigs
the
increase
of
filth
and
foul
smells
consequent
upon
their
being
raised
is
of
course
very
great
and
moreover
told
me
when
i
preferred
poor
jack
request
to
him
that
their
allowance
was
no
more
than
would
suffice
their
own
necessity
and
that
they
had
not
the
means
of
feeding
the
animals
with
a
little
good
management
they
might
very
easily
obtain
them
however
their
little
alone
would
suffice
to
it
and
the
pork
and
bacon
would
prove
a
most
welcome
addition
to
their
farinaceous
diet
you
perceive
at
once
or
if
you
could
have
seen
the
boy
face
you
would
have
perceived
at
once
that
his
situation
was
no
mystery
to
him
that
his
value
to
and
as
he
supposed
to
me
was
perfectly
well
known
to
him
and
that
he
comprehended
immediately
that
his
expressing
even
the
desire
to
be
free
might
be
construed
by
me
into
an
offence
and
sought
by
eager
protestations
of
his
delighted
acquiescence
in
slavery
to
conceal
his
soul
natural
yearning
lest
i
should
resent
it
was
a
sad
passage
between
us
and
sent
me
home
full
of
the
most
painful
thoughts
i
told
with
much
indignation
of
poor
harriet
flogging
and
represented
that
if
the
people
were
to
be
chastised
for
anything
they
said
to
me
i
must
leave
the
place
as
i
could
not
but
hear
their
complaints
and
endeavour
by
all
my
miserable
limited
means
to
better
their
condition
while
i
was
here
he
said
he
would
ask
o
about
it
assuring
me
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
impossible
to
believe
a
single
word
any
of
these
people
said
at
dinner
accordingly
the
enquiry
was
made
as
to
the
cause
of
her
punishment
and
o
then
said
it
was
not
at
all
for
what
she
had
told
me
that
he
had
flogged
her
but
for
having
answered
him
impertinently
that
he
had
ordered
her
into
the
field
whereupon
she
had
said
she
was
ill
and
could
not
work
that
he
retorted
he
knew
better
and
bade
her
get
up
and
go
to
work
she
replied
well
i
go
but
i
shall
just
come
back
again
meaning
that
when
in
the
field
she
would
be
unable
to
work
and
obliged
to
return
to
the
hospital
this
reply
o
said
gave
her
a
good
lashing
it
was
her
business
to
have
gone
into
the
field
without
answering
me
and
then
we
should
have
soon
seen
whether
she
could
work
or
not
i
gave
it
to
chloe
too
for
some
such
impudence
i
give
you
the
words
of
the
conversation
which
was
prolonged
to
a
great
length
the
overseer
complaining
of
sham
sicknesses
of
the
slaves
and
detailing
the
most
disgusting
struggle
which
is
going
on
the
whole
time
on
the
one
hand
to
inflict
and
on
the
other
to
evade
oppression
and
injustice
with
this
sauce
i
ate
my
dinner
and
truly
it
tasted
bitter
towards
sunset
i
went
on
the
river
to
take
my
rowing
lesson
a
darling
little
canoe
which
carries
two
oars
and
a
steersman
and
rejoices
in
the
appropriate
title
of
the
is
my
especial
vessel
and
with
help
and
instructions
i
contrived
this
evening
to
row
upwards
of
half
a
mile
coasting
the
edge
of
the
island
to
another
very
large
rice
mill
the
enormous
wheel
of
which
is
turned
by
the
tide
a
small
bank
of
mud
and
sand
covered
with
reedy
coarse
grass
divides
the
river
into
two
arms
on
this
side
of
the
island
the
deep
channel
is
on
the
outside
of
this
bank
and
as
we
rowed
home
this
evening
the
tide
having
fallen
we
scraped
sand
almost
the
whole
way
domain
it
seems
to
me
will
presently
fill
up
this
shallow
stream
and
join
itself
to
the
the
whole
course
of
this
most
noble
river
is
full
of
shoals
banks
mud
and
and
the
navigation
which
is
difficult
to
those
who
know
it
well
is
utterly
baffling
to
the
inexperienced
the
fact
is
that
the
two
elements
are
so
fused
hereabouts
that
there
are
hardly
such
things
as
earth
or
water
proper
that
which
styles
itself
the
former
is
a
fat
muddy
slimy
sponge
that
floating
half
under
the
turbid
river
looks
yet
saturated
with
the
thick
waves
which
every
now
and
then
reclaim
their
late
dominion
and
cover
it
almost
entirely
the
water
again
cloudy
and
yellow
like
seems
but
a
solution
of
such
islands
rolling
turbid
and
thick
with
alluvium
which
it
both
gathers
and
deposits
as
it
sweeps
along
with
a
swollen
smooth
rapidity
that
almost
deceives
the
eye
amphibious
creatures
alligators
serpents
and
wild
fowl
haunt
these
yet
but
regions
where
land
and
water
are
of
the
consistency
of
the
one
seeming
too
unstable
to
walk
on
the
other
almost
too
thick
to
float
in
but
then
the
sky
if
no
human
chisel
ever
yet
cut
breath
neither
did
any
human
pen
ever
write
light
if
it
did
mine
should
spread
out
before
you
the
unspeakable
glories
of
these
southern
heavens
the
saffron
brightness
of
morning
the
blue
intense
brilliancy
of
noon
the
golden
splendour
and
the
rosy
softness
of
sunset
italy
and
claude
lorraine
may
go
hang
themselves
together
heaven
itself
does
not
seem
brighter
or
more
beautiful
to
the
imagination
than
these
surpassing
pageants
of
fiery
rays
and
beds
of
orange
golden
clouds
with
edges
too
bright
to
look
on
scattered
wreaths
of
faintest
rosy
bloom
amber
streaks
and
pale
green
lakes
between
and
amid
sky
all
mingled
blue
and
rose
tints
a
spectacle
to
make
one
fall
over
the
boat
side
with
one
head
broken
off
with
looking
adoringly
upwards
but
which
on
paper
means
nothing
at
six
our
little
canoe
grazed
the
steps
at
the
landing
these
were
covered
with
young
women
and
boys
and
girls
drawing
water
for
their
various
household
purposes
a
very
small
cedar
pail
a
piggin
as
they
termed
it
serves
to
scoop
up
the
river
water
and
having
by
this
means
filled
a
large
bucket
they
transfer
this
to
their
heads
and
thus
laden
march
home
with
the
purifying
element
what
to
do
with
it
i
can
not
imagine
for
evidence
of
its
ever
having
been
introduced
into
their
dwellings
i
saw
none
as
i
ascended
the
stairs
they
surrounded
me
with
shrieks
and
yells
of
joy
uttering
exclamations
of
delight
and
amazement
at
my
rowing
considering
that
they
dig
delve
carry
burthens
and
perform
many
more
athletic
exercises
than
pulling
a
light
oar
i
was
rather
amused
at
this
but
it
was
the
singular
fact
of
seeing
a
white
woman
stretch
her
sinews
in
any
toilsome
exercise
which
astounded
them
accustomed
as
they
are
to
see
both
men
and
women
of
the
privileged
skin
eschew
the
slightest
shadow
of
labour
as
a
thing
not
only
painful
but
degrading
they
will
learn
another
lesson
from
me
however
whose
idea
of
heaven
was
pronounced
by
a
friend
of
mine
to
whom
i
once
communicated
it
to
be
hard
work
it
was
only
just
six
and
these
women
had
all
done
their
tasks
i
exhorted
them
to
go
home
and
wash
their
children
and
clean
their
houses
and
themselves
which
they
professed
themselves
ready
to
do
but
said
they
had
no
soap
then
began
a
chorus
of
mingled
requests
for
soap
for
summer
clothing
and
a
variety
of
things
which
if
only
give
we
we
be
so
clean
for
ever
this
request
for
summer
clothing
by
the
by
i
think
a
very
reasonable
one
the
allowance
of
clothes
made
yearly
to
each
slave
by
the
present
regulations
of
the
estate
is
a
certain
number
of
yards
of
flannel
and
as
much
more
of
what
they
call
plains
an
extremely
stout
thick
heavy
woollen
cloth
of
a
dark
grey
or
blue
colour
which
resembles
the
species
of
carpet
we
call
drugget
this
and
two
pair
of
shoes
is
the
regular
ration
of
clothing
but
these
plains
would
be
intolerable
to
any
but
negroes
even
in
winter
in
this
climate
and
are
intolerable
to
them
in
the
summer
a
far
better
arrangement
in
my
opinion
would
be
to
increase
their
allowance
of
flannel
and
under
clothing
and
give
them
dark
chintzes
instead
of
these
thick
carpets
which
are
very
often
the
only
covering
they
wear
at
all
i
did
not
impart
all
this
to
my
petitioners
but
disengaging
myself
from
them
for
they
held
my
hands
and
clothes
i
conjured
them
to
offer
us
some
encouragement
to
better
their
condition
by
bettering
it
as
much
as
they
could
themselves
enforced
the
virtue
of
washing
themselves
and
all
belonging
to
them
and
at
length
made
good
my
retreat
as
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
such
a
letter
as
this
should
ever
come
to
an
end
i
had
better
spare
you
for
the
present
you
shall
have
a
faithful
journal
i
promise
you
henceforward
as
hitherto
from
your
ever
dear
e
we
had
a
species
of
fish
this
morning
for
our
breakfast
which
deserves
more
glory
than
i
can
bestow
upon
it
had
i
been
the
ingenious
man
who
wrote
a
poem
upon
fish
the
white
mullet
of
the
altamaha
should
have
been
at
least
my
heroine
cousin
is
the
heavenliest
creature
that
goes
upon
fins
i
took
a
long
walk
this
morning
to
settlement
no
the
third
village
on
the
island
my
way
lay
along
the
side
of
the
canal
beyond
which
and
only
divided
from
it
by
a
raised
narrow
causeway
rolled
the
brimming
river
with
its
girdle
of
glittering
evergreens
while
on
my
other
hand
a
deep
trench
marked
the
line
of
the
rice
fields
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
increase
of
merely
a
shower
of
rain
might
join
all
these
waters
together
and
lay
the
island
under
its
original
covering
again
i
visited
the
people
and
houses
here
i
found
nothing
in
any
respect
different
from
what
i
have
described
to
you
at
settlement
no
during
the
course
of
my
walk
i
startled
from
its
repose
in
one
of
the
a
huge
blue
heron
you
must
have
seen
as
i
often
have
these
creatures
stuffed
in
museums
but
is
another
matter
and
far
more
curious
to
meet
them
stalking
on
their
stilts
of
legs
over
a
and
then
on
your
near
approach
see
them
spread
their
wide
heavy
wings
and
throw
themselves
upon
the
air
with
their
long
shanks
flying
after
them
in
a
most
grotesque
and
laughable
manner
they
fly
as
if
they
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
very
well
but
standing
still
their
height
between
four
and
five
feet
and
peculiar
colour
a
dusky
greyish
blue
with
black
about
the
head
render
their
appearance
very
beautiful
and
striking
in
the
afternoon
i
and
jack
rowed
ourselves
over
to
darien
it
is
saturday
the
day
of
the
week
on
which
the
slaves
from
the
island
are
permitted
to
come
over
to
the
town
to
purchase
such
things
as
they
may
require
and
can
afford
and
to
dispose
to
the
best
advantage
of
their
poultry
moss
and
eggs
i
met
many
of
them
paddling
themselves
singly
in
their
slight
canoes
scooped
out
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
parties
of
three
and
four
rowing
boats
of
their
own
building
laden
with
their
purchases
singing
laughing
talking
and
apparently
enjoying
their
holiday
to
the
utmost
they
all
hailed
me
with
shouts
of
delight
as
i
pulled
past
them
and
many
were
the
injunctions
bawled
after
jack
to
and
take
good
care
of
missis
we
returned
home
through
the
glory
of
a
sunset
all
and
rosy
and
found
that
one
of
the
slaves
a
young
lad
for
whom
has
a
particular
regard
was
dangerously
h
was
sent
for
and
there
is
every
probability
that
he
and
o
will
be
up
all
night
with
the
poor
fellow
i
shall
write
more
being
sunday
dear
e
a
large
boat
full
of
people
from
hampton
came
up
to
go
to
church
at
darien
and
to
pay
their
respects
to
their
master
and
see
their
new
the
same
scene
was
acted
over
again
that
occurred
on
our
first
arrival
a
crowd
clustered
round
the
house
door
to
whom
i
and
my
babies
were
produced
and
with
every
individual
of
whom
we
had
to
shake
hands
some
times
they
brought
us
up
presents
of
eggs
their
only
wealth
beseeching
us
to
take
them
and
one
young
lad
the
son
of
frank
had
a
beautiful
pair
of
chickens
which
he
offered
most
earnestly
to
s
we
took
one
of
them
not
to
mortify
the
poor
fellow
and
a
green
ribbon
being
tied
round
its
leg
it
became
a
sacred
fowl
missis
chicken
by
the
by
this
young
man
had
so
light
a
complexion
and
such
regular
straight
features
that
had
i
seen
him
anywhere
else
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
southern
european
or
perhaps
in
favour
of
his
tatters
a
gipsy
but
certainly
it
never
would
have
occurred
to
me
that
he
was
the
son
of
negro
parents
i
observed
this
to
who
merely
replied
is
the
son
of
frank
and
his
wife
betty
and
they
are
both
black
enough
as
you
see
the
expressions
of
devotion
and
delight
of
these
poor
people
are
the
most
fervent
you
can
imagine
one
of
them
speaking
to
me
of
and
saying
that
they
had
heard
that
he
had
not
been
well
added
we
hear
so
missis
and
we
not
know
what
to
do
oh
missis
massa
sick
all
him
people
h
came
again
to
see
the
poor
sick
boy
who
is
doing
much
better
and
bidding
fair
to
recover
he
entertained
me
with
an
account
of
the
darien
society
its
aristocracies
and
democracies
its
little
grandeurs
and
smaller
pettinesses
its
circles
higher
and
lower
its
social
jealousies
fine
invisible
lines
of
demarcation
imperceptible
shades
of
different
respectability
and
delicate
divisions
of
genteel
genteeler
genteelest
me
added
the
worthy
doctor
can
not
well
enter
into
the
spirit
of
these
nice
distinctions
it
suits
neither
my
taste
nor
my
interest
and
my
house
is
perhaps
the
only
one
in
darien
where
you
would
find
all
these
opposite
and
contending
elements
combined
the
doctor
is
connected
with
the
aristocracy
of
the
place
and
like
a
wise
man
remembers
notwithstanding
that
those
who
are
not
are
quite
as
liable
to
be
ill
and
call
in
medical
assistance
as
those
who
are
he
is
a
shrewd
intelligent
man
with
an
excellent
knowledge
of
his
profession
much
kindness
of
heart
and
apparent
cheerful
good
temper
i
have
already
severely
tried
the
latter
by
the
unequivocal
expression
of
my
opinions
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
though
i
perceived
that
it
required
all
his
to
listen
with
anything
like
patience
to
my
highly
incendiary
and
inflammatory
doctrines
he
yet
did
so
and
though
he
was
i
have
no
doubt
perfectly
at
the
discovery
lost
nothing
of
his
courtesy
or
by
the
by
i
must
tell
you
that
at
an
early
period
of
the
conversation
upon
my
saying
put
all
other
considerations
out
of
the
question
and
first
propose
to
you
the
injustice
of
the
system
alone
replied
my
friend
the
doctor
you
put
it
upon
that
ground
you
the
question
at
once
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
that
whatever
but
and
then
followed
the
usual
train
of
pleadings
happiness
tenderness
care
indulgence
all
the
substitutes
that
may
or
may
not
be
put
in
the
place
of
and
which
these
slaveholders
attempt
to
persuade
others
and
perhaps
themselves
effectually
supply
its
want
after
church
hours
the
people
came
back
from
darien
they
are
only
permitted
to
go
to
darien
to
church
once
a
month
on
the
intermediate
sundays
they
assemble
in
the
house
of
london
head
cooper
an
excellent
and
pious
man
who
heaven
alone
knows
how
has
obtained
some
little
knowledge
of
reading
and
who
reads
prayers
and
the
bible
to
his
fellow
slaves
and
addresses
them
with
extemporaneous
exhortations
i
have
the
greatest
desire
to
attend
one
of
these
religious
meetings
but
fear
to
put
the
people
under
any
the
slightest
restraint
however
i
shall
see
by
and
by
how
they
feel
about
it
themselves
you
have
heard
of
course
many
and
contradictory
statements
as
to
the
degree
of
religious
instruction
afforded
to
the
negroes
of
the
south
and
their
opportunities
of
worship
until
the
late
abolition
movement
the
spiritual
interests
of
the
slaves
were
about
as
little
regarded
as
their
physical
necessities
the
outcry
which
has
been
raised
with
threefold
force
within
the
last
few
years
against
the
whole
system
has
induced
its
upholders
and
defenders
to
adopt
as
measures
of
personal
extenuation
some
appearance
of
religious
instruction
such
as
it
is
and
some
pretence
at
physical
indulgences
such
as
they
are
bestowed
apparently
voluntarily
upon
their
dependants
at
darien
a
church
is
appropriated
to
the
especial
use
of
the
slaves
who
are
almost
all
of
them
baptists
here
and
a
gentleman
officiates
in
it
of
course
white
who
i
understand
is
very
zealous
in
the
cause
of
their
spiritual
he
like
most
southern
men
clergy
or
others
jump
the
present
life
in
their
charities
to
the
slaves
and
go
on
to
furnish
them
with
all
requisite
conveniences
for
the
next
there
were
a
short
time
ago
two
free
black
preachers
in
this
neighbourhood
but
they
have
lately
been
ejected
from
the
place
i
could
not
clearly
learn
but
one
may
possibly
imagine
upon
what
grounds
i
do
not
think
that
a
residence
on
a
slave
plantation
is
likely
to
be
peculiarly
advantageous
to
a
child
like
my
eldest
i
was
observing
her
among
her
swarthy
worshippers
for
they
follow
her
as
such
and
saw
with
dismay
the
universal
eagerness
with
which
they
sprang
to
obey
her
little
gestures
of
command
she
said
something
about
a
swing
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
frank
had
erected
it
for
her
and
a
dozen
young
slaves
were
ready
to
swing
little
think
of
learning
to
rule
despotically
your
fellow
creatures
before
the
first
lesson
of
has
been
well
spelt
over
it
makes
me
tremble
but
i
shall
find
a
remedy
or
remove
myself
and
the
child
from
this
misery
and
ruin
you
can
not
conceive
anything
more
grotesque
than
the
sunday
trim
of
the
poor
people
their
ideality
as
combe
would
say
being
i
should
think
twice
as
big
as
any
rational
bump
in
their
head
their
sabbath
toilet
really
presents
the
most
ludicrous
combination
of
incongruities
that
you
can
conceive
frills
flounces
ribbands
combs
stuck
in
their
woolly
heads
as
if
they
held
up
any
portion
of
the
stiff
and
ungovernable
hair
filthy
finery
every
colour
in
the
rainbow
and
the
deepest
possible
shades
blended
in
fierce
companionship
round
one
dusky
visage
head
handkerchiefs
that
put
one
very
eyes
out
from
a
mile
off
chintzes
with
sprawling
patterns
that
might
be
seen
if
the
clouds
were
printed
with
them
beads
bugles
flaring
sashes
and
above
all
little
fanciful
aprons
which
finish
these
incongruous
toilets
with
a
sort
of
airy
grace
which
i
assure
you
is
perfectly
indescribable
one
young
man
the
eldest
son
and
heir
of
our
washerwoman
hannah
came
to
pay
his
respects
to
me
in
a
magnificent
black
satin
waistcoat
shirt
gills
which
absolutely
engulphed
his
black
visage
and
neither
shoes
nor
stockings
on
his
feet
among
our
visitors
from
simons
was
hannah
mother
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
not
a
girl
of
sixteen
on
the
plantations
but
has
children
nor
a
woman
of
thirty
but
has
grandchildren
old
house
molly
as
she
is
called
from
the
circumstance
of
her
having
been
one
of
the
slaves
employed
in
domestic
offices
during
major
residence
on
the
island
is
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
respected
slaves
on
the
estate
and
was
introduced
to
me
by
with
especial
marks
of
attention
and
regard
she
absolutely
embraced
him
and
seemed
unable
sufficiently
to
express
her
ecstacy
at
seeing
him
again
her
dress
like
that
of
her
daughter
and
all
the
servants
who
have
at
any
time
been
employed
about
the
family
bore
witness
to
a
far
more
improved
taste
than
the
half
savage
adornment
of
the
other
poor
blacks
and
upon
my
observing
to
her
how
agreeable
her
neat
and
cleanly
appearance
was
to
me
she
replied
that
her
old
master
major
was
extremely
particular
in
this
respect
and
that
in
his
time
all
the
house
servants
were
obliged
to
be
very
nice
and
careful
about
their
persons
she
named
to
me
all
her
children
an
immense
tribe
and
by
the
by
e
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
whereas
the
increase
of
this
race
is
frequently
adduced
as
a
proof
of
their
good
treatment
and
well
being
it
really
and
truly
is
no
such
thing
and
springs
from
quite
other
causes
than
the
peace
and
plenty
which
a
rapidly
increasing
population
are
supposed
to
indicate
if
you
will
reflect
for
a
moment
upon
the
overgrown
families
of
the
irish
peasantry
and
english
manufacturers
you
will
agree
with
me
that
these
prolific
shoots
by
no
means
necessarily
spring
from
a
rich
or
healthy
soil
peace
and
plenty
are
certainly
causes
of
human
increase
and
so
is
recklessness
and
this
i
take
it
is
the
impulse
in
the
instance
of
the
english
manufacturer
the
irish
peasant
and
the
negro
slave
indeed
here
it
is
more
than
recklessness
for
there
are
certain
indirect
premiums
held
out
to
obey
the
early
commandment
of
replenishing
the
earth
which
do
not
fail
to
have
their
full
effect
in
the
first
place
none
of
the
cares
those
noble
cares
that
holy
thoughtfulness
which
lifts
the
human
above
the
brute
parent
are
ever
incurred
here
by
either
father
or
mother
the
relation
indeed
resembles
as
far
as
circumstances
can
possibly
make
it
do
so
the
connection
between
the
animal
and
its
young
the
father
having
neither
authority
power
responsibility
or
charge
in
his
children
is
of
course
as
among
brutes
the
least
attached
to
his
offspring
the
mother
by
the
natural
law
which
renders
the
infant
dependent
on
her
for
its
first
nourishment
is
more
so
but
as
neither
of
them
is
bound
to
educate
or
to
support
their
children
all
the
unspeakable
tenderness
and
solemnity
all
the
rational
and
all
the
spiritual
grace
and
glory
of
the
connection
is
lost
and
it
becomes
mere
breeding
bearing
suckling
and
there
an
end
but
it
is
not
only
the
absence
of
the
conditions
which
god
has
affixed
to
the
relation
which
tends
to
encourage
the
reckless
increase
of
the
race
they
enjoy
by
means
of
numerous
children
certain
positive
advantages
in
the
first
place
every
woman
who
is
pregnant
as
soon
as
she
chooses
to
make
the
fact
known
to
the
overseer
is
relieved
of
a
certain
portion
of
her
work
in
the
field
which
lightening
of
labour
continues
of
course
as
long
as
she
is
so
burthened
on
the
birth
of
a
child
certain
additions
of
clothing
and
an
additional
weekly
ration
are
bestowed
on
the
family
and
these
matters
small
as
they
may
seem
act
as
powerful
inducements
to
creatures
who
have
none
of
the
restraining
influences
actuating
them
which
belong
to
the
parental
relation
among
all
other
people
whether
civilised
or
savage
moreover
they
have
all
of
them
a
most
distinct
and
perfect
knowledge
of
their
value
to
their
owners
as
property
and
a
woman
thinks
and
not
much
amiss
that
the
more
frequently
she
adds
to
the
number
of
her
master
live
stock
by
bringing
new
slaves
into
the
world
the
more
claims
she
will
have
upon
his
consideration
and
goodwill
this
was
perfectly
evident
to
me
from
the
meritorious
air
with
which
the
women
always
made
haste
to
inform
me
of
the
number
of
children
they
had
borne
and
the
frequent
occasions
on
which
the
older
slaves
would
direct
my
attention
to
their
children
exclaiming
missis
little
niggers
for
you
and
massa
plenty
little
niggers
for
you
and
little
missis
a
very
agreeable
apostrophe
to
me
indeed
as
you
will
believe
i
have
let
this
letter
lie
for
a
day
or
two
dear
e
from
press
of
more
immediate
avocations
i
have
nothing
very
particular
to
add
to
it
on
monday
evening
i
rowed
over
to
darien
with
to
fetch
over
the
doctor
who
was
coming
to
visit
some
of
our
people
as
i
sat
waiting
in
the
boat
for
the
return
of
the
gentlemen
the
sun
went
down
or
rather
seemed
to
dissolve
bodily
into
the
glowing
clouds
which
appeared
but
a
fusion
of
the
great
orb
of
light
the
stars
twinkled
out
in
the
sky
and
the
evening
air
as
it
fanned
the
earth
to
sleep
was
as
soft
as
a
summer
evening
breeze
in
the
north
a
sort
of
dreamy
stillness
seemed
creeping
over
the
world
and
into
my
spirit
as
the
canoe
just
tilted
against
the
steps
that
led
to
the
wharf
raised
by
the
scarce
perceptible
heaving
of
the
water
a
melancholy
monotonous
sounded
from
a
distance
up
the
stream
and
presently
floating
slowly
down
with
the
current
huge
shapeless
black
relieved
against
the
sky
came
one
of
those
rough
barges
piled
with
cotton
called
hereabouts
ocone
boxes
the
vessel
itself
is
really
nothing
but
a
monstrous
square
box
made
of
rough
planks
put
together
in
the
roughest
manner
possible
to
attain
the
necessary
object
of
keeping
the
cotton
dry
upon
this
great
tray
are
piled
the
swollen
apoplectic
looking
cotton
bags
to
the
height
of
ten
twelve
and
fourteen
feet
this
huge
floats
lazily
down
the
river
from
the
upper
country
to
darien
they
are
flat
bottomed
and
of
course
draw
little
water
the
stream
from
whence
they
are
named
is
an
up
country
river
which
by
its
junction
with
the
ocmulgee
forms
the
altamaha
here
at
least
you
perceive
the
indian
names
remain
and
long
may
they
do
so
for
they
seem
to
me
to
become
the
very
character
of
the
streams
and
mountains
they
indicate
and
are
indeed
significant
to
the
learned
in
savage
tongues
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
such
titles
as
jones
creek
onion
creek
these
ocone
boxes
are
broken
up
at
darien
where
the
cotton
is
shipped
either
for
the
savannah
charleston
or
liverpool
markets
and
the
timber
of
which
they
are
constructed
sold
we
rowed
the
doctor
over
to
see
some
of
his
patients
on
the
island
and
before
his
departure
a
most
animated
discussion
took
place
upon
the
subject
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
his
talents
qualifications
opinions
above
all
his
views
with
regard
to
the
slave
system
who
you
know
is
no
abolitionist
and
is
a
very
devoted
van
buren
man
maintained
with
great
warmth
the
and
his
evident
and
expressed
intention
of
protecting
the
rights
of
the
south
the
doctor
on
the
other
hand
quoted
a
certain
speech
of
the
president
upon
the
question
of
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
his
fears
interpreted
into
a
mere
evasion
of
the
matter
and
an
indication
that
at
some
future
period
he
van
buren
might
take
a
different
view
of
the
subject
i
confess
for
my
own
part
that
if
the
doctor
quoted
the
speech
right
and
if
the
president
is
not
an
honest
man
and
if
i
were
a
southern
slave
holder
i
should
not
feel
altogether
secure
of
van
buren
present
opinions
or
future
conduct
upon
this
subject
these
three
however
are
material
points
of
consideration
our
friend
the
doctor
inclined
vehemently
to
clay
as
one
on
whom
the
slave
holders
could
depend
georgia
however
as
a
state
is
perhaps
the
most
democratic
in
the
union
though
here
as
well
as
in
other
places
that
you
and
i
know
of
a
certain
class
calling
themselves
the
first
and
honestly
believing
themselves
the
best
set
their
faces
against
the
modern
fashioned
republicanism
professing
and
i
have
no
doubt
with
great
sincerity
that
their
ideas
of
democracy
are
altogether
of
a
different
kind
i
went
again
to
the
infirmary
and
was
happy
to
perceive
that
there
really
was
an
evident
desire
to
conform
to
my
instructions
and
keep
the
place
in
a
better
condition
than
formerly
among
the
sick
i
found
a
poor
woman
suffering
dreadfully
from
the
she
had
done
nothing
to
alleviate
her
pain
but
apply
some
leaves
of
what
tree
or
plant
i
could
not
ascertain
and
tie
up
her
head
in
a
variety
of
dirty
cloths
till
it
was
as
large
as
her
whole
body
i
removed
all
these
and
found
one
side
of
her
face
and
neck
very
much
swollen
but
so
begrimed
with
filth
that
it
was
really
no
very
agreeable
task
to
examine
it
the
first
process
of
course
was
washing
which
however
appeared
to
her
so
very
unusual
an
operation
that
i
had
to
perform
it
for
her
myself
sweet
oil
and
laudanum
and
raw
cotton
being
then
applied
to
her
ear
and
neck
she
professed
herself
much
relieved
but
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
the
warm
water
sponging
had
done
her
more
good
than
anything
else
i
was
sorry
not
to
ascertain
what
leaves
she
had
applied
to
her
ear
these
simple
remedies
resorted
to
by
savages
and
people
as
ignorant
are
generally
approved
by
experience
and
sometimes
condescendingly
adopted
by
science
i
remember
once
when
was
suffering
from
a
severe
attack
of
inflammatory
rheumatism
doctor
c
desired
him
to
bind
round
his
knee
the
leaves
of
the
poplar
i
believe
you
call
it
saying
that
he
had
learnt
that
remedy
from
the
negroes
in
virginia
and
found
it
a
most
effectual
one
my
next
agreeable
office
in
the
infirmary
this
morning
was
superintending
the
washing
of
two
little
babies
whose
mothers
were
nursing
them
with
quite
as
much
ignorance
as
zeal
having
ordered
a
large
tub
of
water
i
desired
rose
to
undress
the
little
creatures
and
give
them
a
warm
bath
the
mothers
looked
on
in
unutterable
dismay
and
one
of
them
just
as
her
child
was
going
to
be
put
into
the
tub
threw
into
it
all
the
clothes
she
had
just
taken
off
it
as
she
said
to
break
the
unusual
shock
of
the
warm
water
i
immediately
rescued
them
not
but
what
they
were
quite
as
much
in
want
of
washing
as
the
baby
but
it
appeared
upon
enquiry
that
the
woman
had
none
others
to
dress
the
child
in
when
it
should
have
taken
its
bath
they
were
immediately
wrung
and
hung
by
the
fire
to
dry
and
the
poor
little
patients
having
undergone
this
novel
operation
were
taken
out
and
given
to
their
mothers
anything
however
much
more
helpless
and
inefficient
than
these
poor
ignorant
creatures
you
can
not
conceive
they
actually
seemed
incapable
of
drying
or
dressing
their
own
babies
and
i
had
to
finish
their
toilet
myself
as
it
is
only
a
very
few
years
since
the
most
absurd
and
disgusting
customs
have
become
exploded
among
ourselves
you
will
not
of
course
wonder
that
these
poor
people
pin
up
the
lower
part
of
their
infants
bodies
legs
and
all
in
red
flannel
as
soon
as
they
are
born
and
keep
them
in
the
selfsame
envelope
till
it
literally
falls
off
in
the
next
room
i
found
a
woman
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
fit
of
epilepsy
barking
most
violently
she
seemed
to
excite
no
particular
attention
or
compassion
the
women
said
she
was
subject
to
these
fits
and
took
little
or
no
notice
of
her
as
she
lay
barking
like
some
enraged
animal
on
the
ground
again
i
stood
in
profound
ignorance
sickening
with
the
sight
of
suffering
which
i
knew
not
how
to
alleviate
and
which
seemed
to
excite
no
commiseration
merely
from
the
sad
fact
of
its
frequent
occurrence
returning
to
the
house
i
passed
up
the
it
was
between
eleven
and
noon
and
the
people
were
taking
their
first
meal
in
the
day
by
the
by
e
how
do
you
think
berkshire
county
farmers
would
relish
labouring
hard
all
day
upon
of
indian
corn
or
hominy
such
is
the
regulation
on
this
plantation
however
and
i
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
negroes
on
estate
are
generally
considered
well
off
they
go
to
the
fields
at
daybreak
carrying
with
them
their
allowance
of
food
for
the
day
which
towards
noon
not
till
they
eat
cooking
it
over
a
fire
which
they
kindle
as
best
they
can
where
they
are
working
their
second
meal
in
the
day
is
at
night
after
their
labour
is
over
having
worked
at
the
six
hours
without
intermission
of
rest
or
refreshment
since
their
meal
properly
so
called
for
meal
and
nothing
else
those
that
i
passed
sitting
on
their
doorsteps
or
on
the
ground
round
them
eating
were
the
people
employed
at
the
mill
and
as
these
are
near
to
the
settlement
they
had
time
to
get
their
food
from
the
chairs
tables
plates
knives
forks
they
had
none
they
sat
as
i
before
said
on
the
earth
or
doorsteps
and
ate
either
out
of
their
little
cedar
tubs
or
an
iron
pot
some
few
with
broken
iron
spoons
more
with
pieces
of
wood
and
all
the
children
with
their
fingers
a
more
complete
sample
of
savage
feeding
i
never
beheld
at
one
of
the
doors
i
saw
three
young
girls
standing
who
might
be
between
sixteen
and
seventeen
years
old
they
had
evidently
done
eatings
and
were
rudely
playing
and
romping
with
each
other
laughing
and
shouting
like
wild
things
i
went
into
the
house
and
such
another
spectacle
of
filthy
disorder
i
never
beheld
i
then
addressed
the
girls
most
solemnly
showing
them
that
they
were
wasting
in
idle
riot
the
time
in
which
they
might
be
rendering
their
abode
decent
and
told
them
that
it
was
a
shame
for
any
woman
to
live
in
so
dirty
a
place
and
so
beastly
a
condition
they
said
they
had
seen
buckree
white
women
houses
just
as
dirty
and
they
could
not
be
expected
to
be
cleaner
than
white
women
i
then
told
them
that
the
only
difference
between
themselves
and
buckree
women
was
that
the
latter
were
generally
better
informed
and
for
that
reason
alone
it
was
more
disgraceful
to
them
to
be
disorderly
and
dirty
they
seemed
to
listen
to
me
attentively
and
one
of
them
exclaimed
with
great
satisfaction
that
they
saw
i
made
no
difference
between
them
and
white
girls
and
that
they
never
had
been
so
treated
before
i
do
not
know
anything
which
strikes
me
as
a
more
melancholy
illustration
of
the
degradation
of
these
people
than
the
animal
nature
of
their
recreations
in
their
short
seasons
of
respite
from
labour
you
see
them
boys
and
girls
from
the
youngest
age
to
seventeen
and
eighteen
rolling
tumbling
kicking
and
wallowing
in
the
dust
regardless
alike
of
decency
and
incapable
of
any
more
rational
amusement
or
lolling
with
eyes
like
so
many
cats
and
dogs
against
a
wall
or
upon
a
bank
in
the
sun
dozing
away
their
short
leisure
hour
until
called
to
resume
their
labours
in
the
field
or
the
mill
after
this
description
of
the
meals
of
our
labourers
you
will
perhaps
be
curious
to
know
how
it
fares
with
our
house
servants
in
this
respect
precisely
in
the
same
manner
as
far
as
regards
allowance
with
the
exception
of
what
is
left
from
our
table
but
if
possible
with
even
less
comfort
in
one
respect
inasmuch
as
no
time
whatever
is
set
apart
for
their
meals
which
they
snatch
at
any
hour
and
in
any
way
that
they
can
generally
however
standing
or
squatting
on
their
hams
round
the
kitchen
fire
they
have
no
in
the
house
but
when
their
work
is
over
retire
like
the
rest
to
their
hovels
the
discomfort
of
which
has
to
them
all
the
addition
of
comparison
with
our
mode
of
living
now
in
all
establishments
whatever
of
course
some
disparity
exists
between
the
comforts
of
the
and
best
and
the
servant
hall
and
attics
but
here
it
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
degree
the
young
woman
who
performs
the
office
of
and
the
lads
who
wait
upon
us
at
table
have
neither
table
to
feed
at
nor
chair
to
sit
down
upon
themselves
the
boys
sleep
at
night
on
the
hearth
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
the
women
upon
a
rough
board
bedstead
strewed
with
a
little
tree
moss
all
this
shows
how
very
torpid
the
sense
of
justice
is
apt
to
lie
in
the
breasts
of
those
who
have
it
not
awakened
by
the
peremptory
demands
of
others
in
the
north
we
could
not
hope
to
keep
the
worst
and
poorest
servant
for
a
single
day
in
the
wretched
discomfort
in
which
our
negro
servants
are
forced
habitually
to
live
i
received
a
visit
this
morning
from
some
of
the
darien
people
among
them
was
a
most
interesting
young
person
from
whose
acquaintance
if
i
have
any
opportunity
of
cultivating
it
i
promise
myself
much
pleasure
the
ladies
that
i
have
seen
since
i
crossed
the
southern
line
have
all
seemed
to
me
extremely
sickly
in
their
appearance
delicate
in
the
refined
term
but
unfortunately
sickly
in
the
truer
one
they
are
languid
in
their
deportment
and
speech
and
seem
to
give
themselves
up
without
an
effort
to
counteract
it
to
the
enervating
effect
of
their
warm
climate
it
is
undoubtedly
a
most
relaxing
and
unhealthy
one
and
therefore
requires
the
more
imperatively
to
be
met
by
energetic
and
invigorating
habits
both
of
body
and
mind
of
these
however
the
southern
ladies
appear
to
have
at
present
no
very
positive
idea
doctor
told
us
of
a
comical
application
which
his
negro
man
had
made
to
him
for
the
coat
he
was
then
wearing
i
forget
whether
the
fellow
wanted
the
loan
or
the
absolute
gift
of
it
but
his
argument
was
it
might
have
been
an
irishman
that
he
knew
his
master
intended
to
give
it
to
him
by
and
by
and
that
he
thought
he
might
as
well
let
him
have
it
at
once
as
keep
him
waiting
any
longer
for
it
this
story
the
doctor
related
with
great
glee
and
it
furnishes
a
very
good
sample
of
what
the
southerners
are
fond
of
exhibiting
the
degree
of
licence
to
which
they
capriciously
permit
their
favourite
slaves
occasionally
to
carry
their
familiarity
they
seem
to
consider
it
as
an
undeniable
proof
of
the
general
kindness
with
which
their
dependents
are
treated
it
is
as
good
a
proof
of
it
as
the
maudlin
tenderness
of
a
fine
lady
to
her
is
of
her
humane
treatment
of
animals
in
general
servants
whose
claims
to
respect
are
properly
understood
by
themselves
and
their
employers
are
not
made
pets
playthings
jesters
or
companions
of
and
it
is
only
the
degradation
of
the
many
that
admits
of
this
favouritism
to
the
few
a
system
of
favouritism
which
as
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
profoundest
contempt
and
injustice
degrades
the
object
of
it
quite
as
much
though
it
oppresses
him
less
than
the
cruelty
practised
upon
his
fellows
i
had
several
of
these
favourite
slaves
presented
to
me
and
one
or
two
little
negro
children
who
their
owners
assured
me
were
quite
pets
the
only
real
service
which
this
arbitrary
goodwill
did
to
the
objects
of
it
was
quite
involuntary
and
unconscious
on
the
part
of
their
kind
masters
i
mean
the
inevitable
improvement
in
intelligence
which
resulted
to
them
from
being
more
constantly
admitted
to
the
intercourse
of
the
favoured
white
race
i
must
not
forget
to
tell
you
of
a
magnificent
eagle
which
called
me
to
look
at
early
this
morning
i
had
never
before
seen
alive
one
of
these
national
types
of
yours
and
stood
entranced
as
the
noble
creature
swept
like
a
black
cloud
over
the
river
his
bald
white
head
bent
forward
and
shining
in
the
sun
and
his
fierce
eyes
and
beak
directed
towards
one
of
the
beautiful
wild
ducks
on
the
water
which
he
had
evidently
marked
for
his
prey
the
poor
little
duck
who
was
not
ambitious
of
such
a
glorification
dived
and
the
eagle
hovered
above
the
spot
after
a
short
interval
its
victim
rose
to
the
surface
several
yards
nearer
shore
the
great
king
of
birds
stooped
nearer
and
again
the
watery
shield
was
interposed
this
went
on
until
the
poor
driven
by
excess
of
fear
into
unwonted
boldness
rose
after
repeatedly
diving
within
a
short
distance
of
where
we
stood
the
eagle
who
i
presume
had
read
how
we
were
to
have
dominion
over
the
fowls
of
the
air
eagles
included
hovered
sulkily
awhile
over
the
river
and
then
sailing
slowly
towards
the
woods
on
the
opposite
shore
alighted
and
furled
his
great
wings
on
a
huge
cypress
limb
that
stretched
itself
out
against
the
blue
sky
like
the
arm
of
a
giant
for
the
giant
bird
to
perch
upon
i
am
amusing
myself
by
attempting
to
beautify
in
some
sort
this
residence
of
ours
immediately
at
the
back
of
it
runs
a
ditch
about
three
feet
wide
which
empties
and
fills
twice
a
day
with
the
tide
this
lies
like
a
moat
on
two
sides
of
the
house
the
opposite
bank
is
a
steep
dyke
with
a
footpath
along
the
top
one
or
two
willows
droop
over
this
very
interesting
ditch
and
i
thought
i
would
add
to
their
company
some
magnolias
and
myrtles
and
so
make
a
little
evergreen
plantation
round
the
house
i
went
to
the
swamp
reserves
i
have
before
mentioned
to
you
and
chose
some
beautiful
bushes
among
others
a
very
fine
young
pine
at
which
our
overseer
and
all
the
negroes
expressed
much
contemptuous
surprise
for
though
the
tree
is
beautiful
it
is
also
common
and
with
them
as
with
wiser
folk
is
pleases
but
rare
accidents
in
spite
of
their
disparaging
remarks
however
i
persisted
in
having
my
pine
tree
planted
and
i
assure
you
it
formed
a
very
pleasing
variety
among
the
broad
smooth
leaved
evergreens
about
it
while
forming
my
plantation
i
had
a
brand
thrown
into
a
bed
of
tall
yellow
sedges
which
screen
the
brimming
waters
of
the
noble
river
from
our
parlour
window
and
which
i
therefore
wished
removed
the
small
sample
of
a
southern
conflagration
which
ensued
was
very
picturesque
the
flames
devouring
the
light
growth
absolutely
licking
it
off
the
ground
while
the
curling
smoke
drew
off
in
misty
wreaths
across
the
river
the
heat
was
intense
and
i
thought
how
exceedingly
and
unpleasantly
warm
one
must
feel
in
the
midst
of
such
a
forest
burning
as
cooper
describes
having
worked
my
appointed
task
in
the
garden
i
rowed
over
to
darien
and
back
the
rosy
sunset
changing
meantime
to
starry
evening
as
beautiful
as
the
first
the
sky
ever
was
arrayed
in
i
saw
an
advertisement
this
morning
in
the
paper
which
occasioned
me
much
thought
j
c
and
a
n
two
planters
of
this
neighbourhood
have
contracted
to
dig
a
canal
called
the
brunswick
canal
and
not
having
hands
enough
for
the
work
advertise
at
the
same
time
for
negroes
on
hires
and
for
irish
labourers
now
the
irishmen
are
to
have
twenty
dollars
a
month
wages
and
to
be
to
use
the
technical
phrase
which
finding
means
abundant
food
and
the
best
accommodations
which
can
be
procured
for
them
the
negroes
are
hired
from
their
masters
who
will
be
paid
of
course
as
high
a
price
as
they
can
obtain
for
them
probably
a
very
high
one
as
the
demand
for
them
is
urgent
they
in
the
meantime
receiving
no
wages
and
nothing
more
than
the
miserable
negro
fare
of
rice
and
corn
grits
of
course
the
irishmen
and
these
slaves
are
not
allowed
to
work
together
but
are
kept
at
separate
stations
on
the
canal
this
is
every
way
politic
for
the
low
irish
seem
to
have
the
same
sort
of
hatred
of
negroes
which
sects
differing
but
little
in
their
tenets
have
for
each
other
the
fact
is
that
a
condition
in
their
own
country
nearly
similar
has
made
the
poor
irish
almost
as
degraded
a
class
of
beings
as
the
negroes
are
here
and
their
insolence
towards
them
and
hatred
of
them
are
precisely
in
proportion
to
the
resemblance
between
them
this
hiring
out
of
negroes
is
a
horrid
aggravation
of
the
miseries
of
their
condition
for
if
on
the
plantations
and
under
the
masters
to
whom
they
belong
their
labour
is
severe
and
their
food
inadequate
think
what
it
must
be
when
they
are
hired
out
for
a
stipulated
sum
to
a
temporary
employer
who
has
not
even
the
interest
which
it
is
pretended
an
owner
may
feel
in
the
welfare
of
his
slaves
but
whose
chief
aim
it
must
necessarily
be
to
get
as
much
out
of
them
and
expend
as
little
on
them
as
possible
ponder
this
new
form
of
iniquity
and
believe
me
ever
your
most
sincerely
attached
dearest
e
after
finishing
my
last
letter
to
you
i
went
out
into
the
clear
starlight
to
breathe
the
delicious
mildness
of
the
air
and
was
surprised
to
hear
rising
from
one
of
the
houses
of
the
settlement
a
hymn
sung
apparently
by
a
number
of
voices
the
next
morning
i
enquired
the
meaning
of
this
and
was
informed
that
those
negroes
on
the
plantation
who
were
members
of
the
church
were
holding
a
there
is
an
immensely
strong
devotional
feeling
among
these
poor
people
the
worst
of
it
is
that
it
is
zeal
without
understanding
and
profits
them
but
little
yet
light
is
light
even
that
poor
portion
that
may
stream
through
a
and
i
welcome
this
most
ignorant
profession
of
religion
in
dependents
as
the
herald
of
better
and
brighter
things
for
them
some
of
the
planters
are
entirely
inimical
to
any
such
proceedings
and
neither
allow
their
negroes
to
attend
worship
or
to
congregate
together
for
religious
purposes
and
truly
i
think
they
are
wise
in
their
own
generation
on
other
plantations
again
the
same
rigid
discipline
is
not
observed
and
some
planters
and
overseers
go
even
farther
than
toleration
and
encourage
these
devotional
exercises
and
professions
of
religion
having
actually
discovered
that
a
man
may
become
more
faithful
and
trustworthy
even
as
a
slave
who
acknowledges
the
higher
influences
of
christianity
no
matter
in
how
small
a
degree
clergymen
and
certain
piously
inclined
planters
undertake
accordingly
to
enlighten
these
poor
creatures
upon
these
matters
with
a
safe
understanding
however
of
what
truth
is
to
be
given
to
them
and
what
is
not
how
much
they
may
learn
to
become
better
slaves
and
how
much
they
may
not
learn
lest
they
cease
to
be
slaves
at
all
the
process
is
a
very
ticklish
one
and
but
for
the
northern
public
opinion
which
is
now
pressing
the
slaveholders
close
i
dare
say
would
not
be
attempted
at
all
as
it
is
they
are
putting
their
own
throats
and
their
own
souls
in
jeopardy
by
this
very
endeavour
to
serve
god
and
mammon
the
light
that
they
are
letting
in
between
their
fingers
will
presently
strike
them
blind
and
the
mighty
flood
of
truth
which
they
are
straining
through
a
sieve
to
the
thirsty
lips
of
their
slaves
sweep
them
away
like
straws
from
their
cautious
moorings
and
overwhelm
them
in
its
great
deeps
to
the
waters
of
which
man
may
in
nowise
say
thus
far
shall
ye
come
and
no
farther
the
community
i
now
speak
of
the
white
population
of
darien
should
be
a
religious
one
to
judge
by
the
number
of
churches
it
maintains
however
we
know
the
old
proverb
and
at
that
rate
it
may
not
be
so
godly
after
all
and
his
brother
have
been
called
upon
at
various
times
to
subscribe
to
them
all
and
i
saw
this
morning
a
most
fervent
appeal
extremely
from
a
gentleman
living
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
and
whose
slaves
are
notoriously
reminding
of
the
precious
souls
of
his
human
cattle
and
requesting
a
further
donation
for
the
baptist
church
of
which
most
of
the
people
here
are
members
now
this
man
is
known
to
be
a
hard
master
his
negro
houses
are
sheds
not
fit
to
stable
beasts
in
his
slaves
are
ragged
and
miserable
yet
he
is
urgent
for
their
religious
comforts
and
writes
to
about
souls
their
precious
souls
he
was
over
here
a
few
days
ago
and
pressed
me
very
much
to
attend
his
church
i
told
him
i
would
not
go
to
a
church
where
the
people
who
worked
for
us
were
parted
off
from
us
as
if
they
had
the
pest
and
we
should
catch
it
of
them
i
asked
him
for
i
was
curious
to
know
how
they
managed
to
administer
the
sacrament
to
a
mixed
congregation
he
replied
oh
very
easily
that
the
white
portion
of
the
assembly
received
it
first
and
the
blacks
afterwards
new
commandment
i
give
unto
you
that
ye
love
one
another
even
as
i
have
loved
you
oh
what
a
shocking
mockery
however
they
show
their
faith
at
all
events
in
the
declaration
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
since
they
do
not
pretend
to
exclude
from
his
table
those
whom
they
most
certainly
would
not
admit
to
their
own
i
have
as
usual
allowed
this
letter
to
lie
by
dear
e
not
in
the
hope
of
the
occurrence
of
any
event
for
that
is
hopeless
but
until
my
daily
avocations
allowed
me
leisure
to
resume
it
and
afforded
me
at
the
same
time
matter
wherewith
to
do
so
i
really
never
was
so
busy
in
all
my
life
as
i
am
here
i
sit
at
the
receipt
of
custom
involuntarily
enough
from
morning
till
night
no
time
no
place
affords
me
a
respite
from
my
innumerable
petitioners
and
whether
i
be
asleep
or
awake
reading
eating
or
walking
in
the
kitchen
my
or
the
parlour
they
flock
in
with
urgent
entreaties
and
pitiful
stories
and
my
conscience
forbids
my
ever
postponing
their
business
for
any
other
matter
for
with
shame
and
grief
of
heart
i
say
it
by
their
unpaid
labour
i
live
their
nakedness
clothes
me
and
their
heavy
toil
maintains
me
in
luxurious
idleness
surely
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
hear
these
my
most
injured
benefactors
and
indeed
so
intense
in
me
is
the
sense
of
the
injury
they
receive
from
me
and
mine
that
i
should
scarce
dare
refuse
them
the
very
clothes
from
my
back
or
food
from
my
plate
if
they
asked
me
for
it
in
taking
my
daily
walk
round
the
banks
yesterday
i
found
that
i
was
walking
over
violet
roots
the
season
is
too
little
advanced
for
them
to
be
in
bloom
and
i
could
not
find
out
whether
they
were
the
fragrant
violet
or
not
has
been
much
gratified
by
the
arrival
of
k
who
with
his
father
for
nineteen
years
was
the
sole
manager
of
these
estates
and
discharged
his
laborious
task
with
great
ability
and
fidelity
towards
his
employers
how
far
he
understood
his
duties
to
the
slaves
or
whether
indeed
an
overseer
can
in
the
nature
of
things
acknowledge
any
duty
to
them
is
another
question
he
is
a
remarkable
man
and
is
much
respected
for
his
integrity
and
honourable
dealing
by
everybody
here
his
activity
and
energy
are
wonderful
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
having
charge
of
for
nineteen
years
and
personally
governing
without
any
assistance
whatever
seven
hundred
people
scattered
over
three
large
tracts
of
land
at
a
considerable
distance
from
each
other
certainly
bespeaks
efficiency
and
energy
of
a
very
uncommon
order
the
character
i
had
heard
of
him
from
had
excited
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
me
and
i
was
very
glad
of
this
opportunity
of
seeing
a
man
who
for
so
many
years
had
been
sovereign
over
the
poor
people
here
i
met
him
walking
on
the
banks
with
as
i
returned
from
my
own
ramble
during
which
nothing
occurred
or
appeared
to
interest
me
except
by
the
by
my
unexpectedly
coming
quite
close
to
one
of
those
magnificent
scarlet
birds
which
abound
here
and
which
dart
across
your
path
like
a
winged
flame
nothing
can
surpass
the
beauty
of
their
plumage
and
their
voice
is
excellently
melodious
they
are
lovely
my
companions
when
i
do
not
request
the
attendance
of
my
friend
jack
are
a
couple
of
little
terriers
who
are
endowed
to
perfection
with
the
ugliness
and
the
intelligence
of
their
race
they
are
of
infinite
service
on
the
plantation
as
owing
to
the
immense
quantity
of
grain
and
chaff
and
such
matters
rats
and
mice
abound
in
the
mills
and
storehouses
i
crossed
the
threshing
floor
a
very
large
square
perfectly
level
raised
by
artificial
means
about
half
a
foot
from
the
ground
and
covered
equally
all
over
so
as
to
lie
quite
smooth
with
some
preparation
of
tar
it
lies
immediately
between
the
house
and
the
steam
mill
and
on
it
much
of
the
negroes
work
is
done
the
first
threshing
is
given
to
the
rice
and
other
labours
are
carried
on
as
i
walked
across
it
passing
through
the
busy
groups
chiefly
of
women
that
covered
it
i
came
opposite
to
one
of
the
drivers
who
held
in
his
hand
his
whip
the
odious
insignia
of
his
office
i
took
it
from
him
it
was
a
short
stick
of
moderate
size
with
a
thick
square
leather
thong
attached
to
it
as
i
held
it
in
my
hand
i
did
not
utter
a
word
but
i
conclude
as
is
often
the
case
my
face
spoke
what
my
tongue
did
not
for
the
driver
said
missis
me
use
it
for
measure
me
seldom
strike
nigger
with
it
for
one
moment
i
thought
i
must
carry
the
hateful
implement
into
the
house
with
me
an
instant
reflection
however
served
to
show
me
how
useless
such
a
proceeding
would
be
the
people
are
not
mine
nor
their
drivers
nor
their
whips
i
should
but
have
impeded
for
a
few
hours
the
man
customary
office
and
a
new
scourge
would
have
been
easily
provided
and
i
should
have
done
nothing
perhaps
worse
than
nothing
after
dinner
i
had
a
most
interesting
conversation
with
k
among
other
subjects
he
gave
me
a
lively
and
curious
description
of
the
yeomanry
of
georgia
more
properly
termed
have
you
visions
now
of
farmers
with
comfortable
homesteads
decent
habits
industrious
intelligent
cheerful
and
thrifty
such
however
is
not
the
yeomanry
of
georgia
labour
being
here
the
especial
portion
of
slaves
it
is
thenceforth
degraded
and
considered
unworthy
of
all
but
slaves
no
white
man
therefore
of
any
class
puts
hand
to
work
of
any
kind
soever
this
is
an
exceedingly
dignified
way
of
proving
their
gentility
for
the
lazy
planters
who
prefer
an
idle
life
of
and
barbarism
to
the
degradation
of
doing
anything
themselves
but
the
effect
on
the
poorer
whites
of
the
country
is
terrible
i
speak
now
of
the
scattered
white
population
who
too
poor
to
possess
land
or
slaves
and
having
no
means
of
living
in
the
towns
squat
most
appropriately
is
it
so
termed
either
on
other
men
land
or
government
districts
always
here
swamp
or
pine
barren
and
claim
masterdom
over
the
place
they
invade
till
ejected
by
the
rightful
proprietors
these
wretched
creatures
will
not
for
they
are
whites
and
labour
belongs
to
blacks
and
slaves
alone
here
labour
for
their
own
subsistence
they
are
hardly
protected
from
the
weather
by
the
rude
shelters
they
frame
for
themselves
in
the
midst
of
these
dreary
woods
their
food
is
chiefly
supplied
by
shooting
the
wild
fowl
and
venison
and
stealing
from
the
cultivated
patches
of
the
plantations
nearest
at
hand
their
clothes
hang
about
them
in
filthy
tatters
and
the
combined
squalor
and
fierceness
of
their
appearance
is
really
frightful
this
population
is
the
direct
growth
of
slavery
the
planters
are
loud
in
their
execrations
of
these
miserable
vagabonds
yet
they
do
not
see
that
so
long
as
labour
is
considered
the
disgraceful
portion
of
slaves
these
free
men
will
hold
it
nobler
to
starve
or
steal
than
till
the
earth
with
none
but
the
despised
blacks
for
the
blacks
themselves
such
is
the
infinite
power
of
custom
acquiesce
in
this
notion
and
as
i
have
told
you
consider
it
the
lowest
degradation
in
a
white
to
use
any
exertion
i
wonder
considering
the
burthens
they
have
seen
me
lift
the
digging
the
planting
the
rowing
and
the
walking
i
do
that
they
do
not
utterly
contemn
me
and
indeed
they
seem
lost
in
amazement
at
it
talking
of
these
gypsies
without
any
of
the
romantic
associations
that
belong
to
the
latter
people
led
us
to
the
origin
of
such
a
population
slavery
and
you
may
be
sure
i
listened
with
infinite
interest
to
the
opinions
of
a
man
of
uncommon
shrewdness
and
sagacity
who
was
born
in
the
very
bosom
of
it
and
has
passed
his
whole
life
among
slaves
if
any
one
is
competent
to
judge
of
its
effects
such
a
man
is
the
one
and
this
was
his
verdict
hate
slavery
with
all
my
heart
i
consider
it
an
absolute
curse
wherever
it
exists
it
will
keep
those
states
where
it
does
exist
fifty
years
behind
the
others
in
improvement
and
prosperity
further
on
in
the
conversation
he
made
this
most
remarkable
observation
for
its
being
an
irremediable
evil
a
thing
not
to
be
helped
or
got
rid
of
that
all
nonsense
for
as
soon
as
people
become
convinced
that
it
is
their
interest
to
get
rid
of
it
they
will
soon
find
the
means
to
do
so
depend
upon
it
and
undoubtedly
this
is
true
this
is
not
an
age
nor
yours
a
country
where
a
large
mass
of
people
will
long
endure
what
they
perceive
to
be
injurious
to
their
fortunes
and
advancement
blind
as
people
often
are
to
their
highest
and
truest
interests
your
country
folk
have
generally
shown
remarkable
acuteness
in
finding
out
where
their
worldly
progress
suffered
let
or
hindrance
and
have
removed
it
with
laudable
alacrity
now
the
fact
is
not
at
all
as
we
at
the
north
are
sometimes
told
that
the
southern
slaveholders
deprecate
the
evils
of
slavery
quite
as
much
as
we
do
that
they
see
all
its
miseries
that
moreover
they
are
most
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
thing
but
want
the
means
to
do
so
and
submit
most
unwillingly
to
a
necessity
from
which
they
can
not
extricate
themselves
all
this
i
thought
might
be
true
before
i
went
to
the
south
and
often
has
the
charitable
supposition
checked
the
condemnation
which
was
indignantly
rising
to
my
lips
against
these
murderers
of
their
peace
a
little
reflection
however
even
without
personal
observation
might
have
convinced
me
that
this
could
not
be
the
case
if
the
majority
of
southerners
were
satisfied
that
slavery
was
contrary
to
their
worldly
fortunes
slavery
would
be
at
an
end
from
that
very
moment
but
the
fact
is
and
i
have
it
not
only
from
observation
of
my
own
but
from
the
distinct
statement
of
some
of
the
most
intelligent
southern
men
that
i
have
conversed
with
the
only
obstacle
to
immediate
abolition
throughout
the
south
is
the
immense
value
of
the
human
property
and
to
use
the
words
of
a
very
distinguished
carolinian
who
thus
ended
a
long
discussion
we
had
on
the
subject
tell
you
why
abolition
is
impossible
because
every
healthy
negro
can
fetch
a
thousand
dollars
in
the
charleston
market
at
this
moment
and
this
opinion
you
see
tallies
perfectly
with
the
testimony
of
k
he
went
on
to
speak
of
several
of
the
slaves
on
this
estate
as
persons
quite
remarkable
for
their
fidelity
and
intelligence
instancing
old
molly
ned
the
engineer
who
has
the
superintendence
of
the
in
the
and
frank
of
whom
indeed
he
wound
up
the
eulogium
by
saying
he
had
quite
the
principles
of
a
white
man
which
i
thought
most
equivocal
praise
but
he
did
not
intend
it
as
such
as
i
was
complaining
to
of
the
terribly
neglected
condition
of
the
dykes
which
are
in
some
parts
so
overgrown
with
gigantic
briars
that
is
really
impossible
to
walk
over
them
and
the
trench
on
one
hand
and
river
on
the
other
afford
one
extremely
disagreeable
alternatives
k
cautioned
me
to
be
particularly
on
my
guard
not
to
step
on
the
thorns
of
the
orange
tree
these
indeed
are
formidable
spikes
and
he
assured
me
were
peculiarly
poisonous
to
the
flesh
some
of
the
most
painful
and
tedious
wounds
he
had
ever
seen
he
said
were
incurred
by
the
negroes
running
these
large
green
thorns
into
their
feet
this
led
him
to
speak
of
the
glory
and
beauty
of
the
orange
trees
on
the
island
before
a
certain
uncommonly
severe
winter
a
few
years
ago
destroyed
them
all
for
five
miles
round
the
banks
grew
a
double
row
of
noble
orange
trees
as
large
as
our
orchard
apple
trees
covered
with
golden
fruit
and
silver
flowers
it
must
have
been
a
most
magnificent
spectacle
and
captain
f
too
told
me
in
speaking
of
it
that
he
had
brought
basil
hall
here
in
the
season
of
the
trees
blossoming
and
he
had
said
it
was
as
well
worth
crossing
the
atlantic
to
see
that
as
to
see
the
niagara
of
all
these
noble
trees
nothing
now
remains
but
the
roots
which
bear
witness
to
their
size
and
some
young
sprouts
shooting
up
affording
some
hope
that
in
the
course
of
years
the
island
may
wear
its
bridal
garland
again
one
huge
stump
close
to
the
door
is
all
that
remains
of
an
enormous
tree
that
overtopped
the
house
from
the
upper
windows
of
which
oranges
have
been
gathered
from
off
its
branches
and
which
one
year
bore
the
incredible
number
of
oranges
k
assured
me
of
this
as
a
positive
fact
of
which
he
had
at
the
time
made
the
entry
in
his
journal
considering
such
a
crop
from
a
single
tree
well
worthy
of
record
was
called
out
this
evening
to
listen
to
a
complaint
of
over
work
from
a
gang
of
pregnant
women
i
did
not
stay
to
listen
to
the
details
of
their
petition
for
i
am
unable
to
command
myself
on
such
occasions
and
seemed
positively
degraded
in
my
eyes
as
he
stood
enforcing
upon
these
women
the
necessity
of
their
fulfilling
their
appointed
tasks
how
honorable
he
would
have
appeared
to
me
begrimed
with
the
sweat
and
soil
of
the
coarsest
manual
labour
to
what
he
then
seemed
setting
forth
to
these
wretched
ignorant
women
as
a
duty
their
unpaid
exacted
labour
i
turned
away
in
bitter
disgust
i
hope
this
sojourn
among
slaves
may
not
lessen
my
respect
for
him
but
i
fear
it
for
the
details
of
slave
holding
are
so
unmanly
letting
alone
every
other
consideration
that
i
know
not
how
anyone
with
the
spirit
of
a
man
can
condescend
to
them
i
have
been
out
again
on
the
river
rowing
i
find
nothing
new
swamps
crowned
with
perfect
evergreens
are
the
only
land
that
irish
about
here
and
of
course
turn
which
way
i
will
the
natural
features
of
river
and
shore
are
the
same
i
do
not
weary
of
these
most
exquisite
watery
woods
but
you
will
of
my
mention
of
them
i
fear
adieu
dearest
e
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
i
have
been
actually
engaged
in
receiving
and
returning
visits
for
even
to
this
of
all
civilisation
do
these
polite
usages
extend
i
have
been
called
upon
by
several
families
residing
in
and
about
darien
and
rowed
over
in
due
form
to
acknowledge
the
honour
how
shall
i
describe
darien
to
you
the
abomination
of
desolation
is
but
a
poor
type
of
its
forlorn
appearance
as
half
buried
in
sand
its
straggling
wooden
houses
peer
over
the
muddy
bank
of
the
thick
slimy
river
the
whole
town
lies
in
a
bed
of
sand
side
walks
or
mid
walks
there
be
none
distinct
from
each
other
at
every
step
i
took
my
feet
were
ankle
deep
in
the
soil
and
i
had
cause
to
rejoice
that
i
was
booted
for
the
occasion
our
worthy
doctor
whose
lady
i
was
going
to
visit
did
nothing
but
regret
that
i
had
not
allowed
him
to
provide
me
a
carriage
though
the
distance
between
his
house
and
the
landing
is
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
magnitude
of
the
exertion
seemed
to
fill
him
with
amazement
and
he
over
and
over
again
repeated
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
prevail
on
any
of
the
ladies
there
to
take
such
a
walk
the
houses
seemed
scattered
about
here
and
there
apparently
without
any
design
and
looked
for
the
most
part
either
unfinished
or
ruinous
one
feature
of
the
scene
alone
recalled
the
villages
of
new
england
the
magnificent
oaks
which
seemed
to
add
to
the
meanness
and
insignificance
of
the
human
dwellings
they
overshadowed
by
their
enormous
size
and
grotesque
forms
they
reminded
me
of
the
elms
of
newhaven
and
stockbridge
they
are
quite
as
large
and
more
picturesque
from
their
sombre
foliage
and
the
infinite
variety
of
their
forms
a
beauty
wanting
in
the
new
england
elm
which
invariably
rises
and
spreads
in
a
way
which
though
the
most
graceful
in
the
world
at
length
palls
on
the
capricious
human
eye
which
seeks
above
all
other
beauties
variety
our
wife
is
a
new
england
woman
how
can
she
live
here
she
had
the
fair
eyes
and
hair
and
fresh
complexion
of
your
part
of
the
country
and
its
dearly
beloved
snuffle
which
seemed
actually
dearly
beloved
when
i
heard
it
down
here
she
gave
me
some
violets
and
narcissus
already
blossoming
profusely
in
january
and
expressed
like
her
husband
a
thousand
regrets
at
my
having
walked
so
far
a
transaction
of
the
most
amusing
nature
occurred
with
regard
to
the
resources
of
the
darien
bank
and
the
mode
of
carrying
on
business
in
that
liberal
and
enlightened
institution
the
funds
of
which
i
should
think
quite
incalculable
impalpable
certainly
they
appeared
by
our
experience
this
morning
the
river
as
we
came
home
was
covered
with
ocone
boxes
it
is
well
for
them
they
are
so
for
we
rasped
sand
all
the
way
home
through
the
cut
and
in
the
shallows
of
the
river
i
have
been
over
the
under
the
guidance
of
the
overseer
and
frank
and
have
been
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
process
of
threshing
the
rice
which
is
extremely
curious
and
here
i
may
again
mention
another
statement
of
miss
martineau
which
i
am
told
is
and
i
should
suppose
from
what
i
see
here
must
be
a
mistake
she
states
that
the
chaff
of
the
husks
of
the
rice
is
used
as
a
manure
for
the
fields
whereas
the
people
have
assured
me
that
it
is
of
so
hard
stony
and
untractable
a
nature
as
to
be
literally
good
for
nothing
here
i
know
it
is
thrown
away
by
into
the
river
where
its
only
use
appears
to
be
to
act
like
ground
bait
and
attract
a
vast
quantity
of
small
fish
to
its
vicinity
the
number
of
hands
employed
in
this
is
very
considerable
and
the
whole
establishment
comprising
the
fires
and
boilers
and
machinery
of
a
powerful
steam
engine
are
all
under
negro
superintendence
and
direction
after
this
survey
i
occupied
myself
with
my
infant
plantation
of
evergreens
round
the
dyke
in
the
midst
of
which
interesting
pursuit
i
was
interrupted
by
a
visit
from
b
a
neighbouring
planter
who
came
to
transact
some
business
with
about
rice
which
he
had
sent
to
our
mill
to
have
threshed
and
the
price
to
be
paid
for
such
threshing
the
negroes
have
presented
a
petition
that
they
may
be
allowed
to
have
a
ball
in
honour
of
our
arrival
which
demand
has
been
acceded
to
and
furious
preparations
are
being
set
on
foot
on
visiting
the
infirmary
i
was
extremely
pleased
with
the
increased
cleanliness
and
order
observable
in
all
the
rooms
two
little
filthy
children
however
seemed
to
be
still
under
the
of
but
upon
my
saying
to
the
old
nurse
molly
in
whose
ward
they
were
molly
i
do
believe
you
have
bathed
those
children
she
answered
with
infinite
dignity
no
me
wash
um
piccaninny
and
yet
she
tress
me
wid
all
um
niggar
when
sick
the
injured
innocence
and
lofty
conscious
integrity
of
this
speech
silenced
and
abashed
me
and
yet
i
ca
help
it
but
i
do
believe
to
this
present
hour
that
those
children
had
had
any
experience
of
water
at
least
not
washing
water
since
they
first
came
into
the
world
i
rowed
over
to
darien
again
to
make
some
purchases
yesterday
and
enquiring
the
price
of
various
articles
could
not
but
wonder
to
find
them
at
least
three
times
as
dear
as
in
your
northern
villages
the
profits
of
these
southern
shopkeepers
who
for
the
most
part
are
thoroughbred
yankees
with
the
true
yankee
propensity
to
trade
no
matter
on
how
dirty
a
counter
or
in
what
manner
of
wares
are
enormous
the
prices
they
ask
for
everything
from
coloured
calicoes
for
negro
dresses
to
pianofortes
one
of
which
for
curiosity
sake
i
enquired
the
value
of
are
fabulous
and
such
as
none
but
the
laziest
and
most
reckless
people
in
the
world
would
consent
to
afford
on
our
return
we
found
the
water
in
the
cut
so
extremely
low
that
we
were
obliged
to
push
the
boat
through
it
and
did
not
accomplish
it
without
difficulty
the
banks
of
this
canal
when
they
are
thus
laid
bare
present
a
singular
appearance
enough
two
walls
of
solid
mud
through
which
matted
twisted
twined
and
tangled
like
the
natural
veins
of
wood
runs
an
everlasting
net
of
indestructible
roots
the
thousand
toes
of
huge
cypress
feet
the
trees
have
been
cut
down
long
ago
from
the
soil
but
these
fangs
remain
in
the
earth
without
decaying
for
an
incredible
space
of
time
this
long
endurance
of
immersion
is
one
of
the
valuable
properties
of
these
cypress
roots
but
though
excellent
binding
stuff
for
the
sides
of
a
canal
they
must
be
pernicious
growth
in
any
land
used
for
cultivation
that
requires
deep
tillage
on
entering
the
altamaha
we
found
the
tide
so
low
that
we
were
much
obstructed
by
the
sand
banks
which
but
for
their
constant
shifting
would
presently
take
entire
possession
of
this
noble
stream
and
render
it
utterly
impassable
from
shore
to
shore
as
it
already
is
in
several
parts
of
the
channel
at
certain
seasons
of
the
tide
on
landing
i
was
seized
hold
of
by
a
hideous
old
negress
named
sinda
who
had
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
and
of
whom
told
me
a
strange
anecdote
she
passed
at
one
time
for
a
prophetess
among
her
fellow
slaves
on
the
plantation
and
had
acquired
such
an
ascendancy
over
them
that
having
given
out
after
the
fashion
of
miller
that
the
world
was
to
come
to
an
end
at
a
certain
time
and
that
not
a
very
remote
one
the
belief
in
her
assertion
took
such
possession
of
the
people
on
the
estate
that
they
refused
to
work
and
the
rice
and
cotton
fields
were
threatened
with
an
indefinite
fallow
in
consequence
of
this
strike
on
the
part
of
the
cultivators
k
who
was
then
overseer
of
the
property
perceived
the
impossibility
of
arguing
remonstrating
or
even
flogging
this
solemn
panic
out
of
the
minds
of
the
slaves
the
great
final
emancipation
which
they
believed
at
hand
had
stripped
even
the
lash
of
its
prevailing
authority
and
the
terrors
of
an
overseer
for
once
were
as
nothing
in
the
terrible
expectation
of
the
advent
of
the
universal
judge
of
men
they
were
utterly
impracticable
so
like
a
very
shrewd
man
as
he
was
he
acquiesced
in
their
determination
not
to
work
but
he
expressed
to
them
his
belief
that
sinda
was
mistaken
and
he
warned
her
that
if
at
the
appointed
time
it
proved
so
she
would
be
severely
punished
i
do
not
know
whether
he
confided
to
the
slaves
what
he
thought
likely
to
be
the
result
if
she
was
in
the
right
but
poor
sinda
was
in
the
wrong
her
day
of
judgement
came
indeed
and
a
severe
one
it
proved
for
k
had
her
tremendously
flogged
and
her
end
of
things
ended
much
like
miller
but
whereas
he
escaped
unhanged
in
spite
of
his
atrocious
practices
upon
the
fanaticism
and
credulity
of
his
country
people
the
spirit
of
false
prophecy
was
mercilessly
scourged
out
of
her
and
the
faith
of
her
people
of
course
reverted
from
her
to
the
omnipotent
lash
again
think
what
a
dream
that
must
have
been
while
it
lasted
for
those
infinitely
oppressed
people
freedom
without
entering
it
by
the
grim
gate
of
death
brought
down
to
them
at
once
by
the
second
coming
of
christ
whose
first
advent
has
left
them
yet
so
far
from
it
farewell
it
makes
me
giddy
to
think
of
having
been
a
slave
while
that
delusion
lasted
and
after
it
vanished
dearest
e
i
received
early
this
morning
a
visit
from
a
young
negro
called
morris
who
came
to
request
permission
to
be
baptised
the
leave
is
necessary
for
this
ceremony
of
acceptance
into
the
bosom
of
the
christian
church
so
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
it
is
to
be
hoped
the
rite
itself
may
be
indispensable
for
salvation
as
if
had
thought
proper
to
refuse
morris
petition
he
must
infallibly
have
been
lost
in
spite
of
his
own
best
wishes
to
the
contrary
i
could
not
in
discoursing
with
him
perceive
that
he
had
any
very
distinct
ideas
of
the
advantages
he
expected
to
derive
from
the
ceremony
but
perhaps
they
appeared
all
the
greater
for
being
a
little
vague
i
have
seldom
seen
a
more
pleasing
appearance
than
that
of
this
young
man
his
figure
was
tall
and
straight
and
his
face
which
was
of
a
perfect
oval
rejoiced
in
the
grace
very
unusual
among
his
people
of
a
fine
high
forehead
and
the
much
more
frequent
one
of
a
remarkably
gentle
and
sweet
expression
he
was
however
jet
black
and
certainly
did
not
owe
these
personal
advantages
to
any
mixture
in
his
blood
there
is
a
certain
african
tribe
from
which
the
west
indian
slave
market
is
chiefly
recruited
who
have
these
same
characteristic
features
and
do
not
at
all
present
the
ignoble
and
ugly
negro
type
so
much
more
commonly
seen
here
they
are
a
tall
powerful
people
with
remarkably
fine
figures
regular
features
and
a
singularly
warlike
and
fierce
disposition
in
which
respect
they
also
differ
from
the
race
of
negroes
existing
on
the
american
plantations
i
do
not
think
morris
however
could
have
belonged
to
this
tribe
though
perhaps
othello
did
which
would
at
once
settle
the
difficulties
of
those
commentators
who
abiding
by
iago
very
disagreeable
suggestions
as
to
his
purely
african
appearance
are
painfully
compelled
to
forego
the
mitigation
of
supposing
him
a
moor
and
not
a
negro
did
i
ever
tell
you
of
my
dining
in
boston
at
the
h
on
my
first
visit
to
that
city
and
sitting
by
john
quincy
adams
who
talking
to
me
about
desdemona
assured
me
with
a
most
serious
expression
of
sincere
disgust
that
he
considered
all
her
misfortunes
as
a
very
just
judgement
upon
her
for
having
married
a
i
think
if
some
ingenious
american
actor
of
the
present
day
bent
upon
realising
shakespeare
finest
conceptions
with
all
the
advantages
of
modern
enlightenment
could
contrive
to
slip
in
that
opprobrious
title
with
a
true
expression
it
might
really
be
made
quite
a
point
for
iago
as
for
instance
in
his
first
soliloquy
hate
the
nigger
given
in
proper
charleston
or
savannah
fashion
i
am
sure
would
tell
far
better
than
hate
the
moor
only
think
e
what
a
very
new
order
of
interest
the
whole
tragedy
might
receive
acted
throughout
from
this
standpoint
as
the
germans
call
it
in
this
country
and
called
or
the
black
bridal
on
their
return
from
their
walk
this
afternoon
the
children
brought
home
some
pieces
of
of
which
a
small
quantity
grows
on
the
island
when
i
am
most
inclined
to
deplore
the
condition
of
the
poor
slaves
on
these
cotton
and
rice
plantations
the
far
more
intolerable
existence
and
harder
labour
of
those
employed
on
the
sugar
estates
occurs
to
me
sometimes
producing
the
effect
of
a
lower
circle
in
dante
of
horrors
opening
beneath
the
one
where
he
seems
to
have
reached
the
climax
of
infernal
punishment
you
may
have
seen
this
vegetable
and
must
at
any
rate
i
should
think
be
familiar
with
it
by
description
it
is
a
long
green
reed
like
the
stalk
of
the
maize
or
indian
corn
only
it
shoots
up
to
a
much
more
considerable
height
and
has
a
consistent
pith
which
together
with
the
rind
itself
is
extremely
sweet
the
principal
peculiarity
of
this
growth
as
perhaps
you
know
is
that
they
are
laid
horizontally
in
the
earth
when
they
are
planted
for
propagation
and
from
each
of
the
notches
or
joints
of
the
recumbent
cane
a
young
shoot
is
produced
at
the
germinating
season
a
very
curious
and
interesting
circumstance
to
me
just
now
in
the
neighbourhood
is
the
projection
of
a
canal
to
be
called
the
brunswick
canal
which
by
cutting
through
the
lower
part
of
the
mainland
towards
the
southern
extremity
of
great
simon
island
is
contemplated
as
a
probable
and
powerful
means
of
improving
the
prosperity
of
the
town
of
brunswick
by
bringing
it
into
immediate
communication
with
the
atlantic
the
scheme
which
i
think
i
have
mentioned
to
you
before
is
i
believe
chiefly
patronised
by
your
states
folk
yankee
enterprise
and
funds
being
very
essential
elements
it
appears
to
me
in
all
southern
projects
and
achievements
this
speculation
however
from
all
i
hear
of
the
difficulties
of
the
undertaking
from
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
the
impossibility
almost
of
obtaining
efficient
labour
is
not
very
likely
to
arrive
at
any
very
satisfactory
result
and
indeed
i
find
it
hard
to
conceive
how
this
part
of
georgia
can
possibly
produce
a
town
which
can
be
worth
the
digging
of
a
canal
even
to
yankee
speculators
there
is
one
feature
of
the
undertaking
however
which
more
than
all
the
others
excites
my
admiration
namely
that
irish
labourers
have
been
advertised
for
to
work
upon
the
canal
and
the
terms
offered
them
are
twenty
dollars
a
month
per
man
and
their
board
now
these
men
will
have
for
fellow
labourers
negroes
who
not
only
will
receive
nothing
at
all
for
their
work
but
who
will
be
hired
by
the
contractors
and
directors
of
the
works
from
their
masters
to
whom
they
will
hand
over
the
price
of
their
labour
while
it
will
be
the
interest
of
the
person
hiring
them
not
only
to
get
as
much
work
as
possible
out
of
them
but
also
to
provide
them
as
economically
with
food
combining
the
two
praiseworthy
endeavours
exactly
in
such
judicious
proportions
as
not
to
let
them
neutralize
each
other
you
will
observe
that
this
case
of
a
master
hiring
out
his
slaves
to
another
employer
from
whom
he
receives
their
rightful
wages
is
a
form
of
slavery
which
though
extremely
common
is
very
seldom
adverted
to
in
those
arguments
for
the
system
which
are
chiefly
founded
upon
the
presumed
regard
for
his
human
property
people
who
have
ever
let
a
favourite
house
to
the
temporary
occupation
of
strangers
can
form
a
tolerable
idea
of
the
difference
between
one
own
regard
and
care
of
one
goods
and
chattels
and
that
of
the
most
conscientious
tenant
and
whereas
i
have
not
yet
observed
that
ownership
is
a
very
effectual
protection
to
the
slaves
against
ill
usage
and
neglect
i
am
quite
prepared
to
admit
that
it
is
a
vastly
better
one
than
the
temporary
interest
which
a
lessee
can
feel
in
the
live
stock
he
hires
out
of
whom
it
is
his
manifest
interest
to
get
as
much
and
into
whom
to
put
as
little
as
possible
yet
thousands
of
slaves
throughout
the
southern
states
are
thus
handed
over
by
the
masters
who
own
them
to
masters
who
do
not
and
it
does
not
require
much
demonstration
to
prove
that
their
estate
is
not
always
the
more
gracious
now
you
must
not
suppose
that
these
same
irish
free
labourers
and
negro
slaves
will
be
permitted
to
work
together
at
this
brunswick
canal
they
say
that
this
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
why
there
would
be
tumults
and
risings
and
broken
heads
and
bloody
bones
and
all
the
natural
results
of
irish
intercommunion
with
their
fellow
creatures
no
doubt
perhaps
even
a
little
more
riot
and
violence
than
merely
comports
with
their
usual
habits
of
milesian
good
fellowship
for
say
the
masters
the
irish
hate
the
negroes
more
even
than
the
americans
do
and
there
would
be
no
bound
to
their
murderous
animosity
if
they
were
brought
in
contact
with
them
on
the
same
portion
of
the
works
of
the
brunswick
canal
doubtless
there
is
some
truth
in
this
the
irish
labourers
who
might
come
hither
would
be
apt
enough
according
to
a
universal
moral
law
to
visit
upon
others
the
injuries
they
had
received
from
others
they
have
been
oppressed
enough
themselves
to
be
oppressive
whenever
they
have
a
chance
and
the
despised
and
degraded
condition
of
the
blacks
presenting
to
them
a
very
ugly
resemblance
of
their
own
home
circumstances
naturally
excite
in
them
the
exercise
of
the
disgust
and
contempt
of
which
they
themselves
are
very
habitually
the
objects
and
that
such
circular
distribution
of
wrongs
may
not
only
be
pleasant
but
have
something
like
the
air
of
retributive
right
to
very
ignorant
folks
is
not
much
to
be
wondered
at
certain
is
the
fact
however
that
the
worst
of
all
tyrants
is
the
one
who
has
been
a
slave
and
for
that
matter
and
i
wonder
if
the
southern
slaveholders
hear
it
with
the
same
ear
that
i
do
and
ponder
it
with
the
same
mind
the
command
of
one
slave
to
another
is
altogether
the
most
uncompromising
utterance
of
insolent
truculent
despotism
that
it
ever
fell
to
my
lot
to
witness
or
listen
to
nigger
i
say
you
black
nigger
you
no
hear
me
call
you
what
for
you
no
run
quick
all
this
dear
e
is
certainly
reasonably
in
favour
of
division
of
labour
on
the
brunswick
canal
but
the
irish
are
not
only
quarrelers
and
rioters
and
fighters
and
drinkers
and
despisers
of
niggers
they
are
a
passionate
impulsive
generous
people
much
given
to
powerful
indignations
which
break
out
suddenly
when
they
are
not
compelled
to
smoulder
sullenly
pestilent
sympathisers
too
and
with
a
sufficient
dose
of
american
atmospheric
air
in
their
lungs
properly
mixed
with
a
right
proportion
of
ardent
spirits
there
is
no
saying
but
what
they
might
actually
take
to
sympathy
with
the
slaves
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
the
possible
consequences
you
perceive
i
am
sure
that
they
can
by
no
means
be
allowed
to
work
together
on
the
brunswick
canal
i
have
been
taking
my
daily
walk
round
the
island
and
visited
the
sugar
mill
and
the
threshing
mill
again
has
received
another
letter
from
parson
s
upon
the
subject
of
more
church
building
in
darien
it
seems
that
there
has
been
a
very
general
panic
in
this
part
of
the
slave
states
lately
occasioned
by
some
injudicious
missionary
preaching
which
was
pronounced
to
be
of
a
decidedly
abolitionist
tendency
the
offensive
preachers
after
sowing
god
only
knows
what
seed
in
this
tremendous
soil
where
one
grain
of
knowledge
may
spring
up
a
gigantic
upas
tree
to
the
prosperity
of
its
most
unfortunate
possessors
were
summarily
and
ignominiously
expulsed
and
now
some
short
sighted
uncomfortable
christians
in
these
parts
among
others
this
said
parson
s
are
possessed
with
the
notion
that
something
had
better
be
done
to
supply
the
want
created
by
the
cessation
of
these
dangerous
exhortations
to
which
the
negroes
have
listened
it
seems
with
complacency
parson
s
seems
to
think
that
having
driven
out
two
preachers
it
might
be
well
to
build
one
church
where
at
any
rate
the
negroes
might
be
exhorted
in
a
safe
and
salutary
manner
ne
leur
donnerait
point
as
the
french
would
say
upon
my
word
e
i
used
to
pity
the
slaves
and
i
do
pity
them
with
all
my
soul
but
oh
dear
oh
dear
their
case
is
a
bed
of
roses
to
that
of
their
owners
and
i
would
go
to
the
slave
block
in
charleston
cheerfully
to
be
purchased
if
my
only
option
was
to
go
thither
as
a
purchaser
i
was
looking
over
this
morning
with
a
most
indescribable
mixture
of
feelings
a
pamphlet
published
in
the
south
upon
the
subject
of
the
religious
instruction
of
the
slaves
and
the
difficulty
of
the
task
undertaken
by
these
reconcilers
of
god
and
mammon
really
seems
to
me
nothing
short
of
piteous
must
give
our
involuntary
servants
they
seldom
call
them
slaves
for
it
is
an
ugly
word
in
an
american
mouth
you
know
enlightenment
say
they
and
where
shall
they
begin
ye
would
that
men
should
do
unto
you
do
ye
also
unto
them
no
but
obey
your
masters
and
there
i
think
they
naturally
come
to
a
full
stop
this
pamphlet
forcibly
suggested
to
me
the
necessity
for
a
slave
church
catechism
and
also
indeed
if
it
were
possible
a
slave
bible
if
these
negro
enlighteners
persist
in
their
pernicious
plan
of
making
christians
of
their
cattle
something
of
the
sort
must
be
done
or
they
will
infallibly
cut
their
own
throats
with
this
sword
of
truth
to
which
they
should
in
no
wise
have
laid
their
hand
and
would
not
doubtless
but
that
it
is
now
thrust
at
them
so
threateningly
that
they
have
no
choice
again
and
again
how
much
i
do
pity
them
i
have
been
walking
to
another
cluster
of
negro
huts
known
as
number
two
and
here
we
took
a
boat
and
rowed
across
the
broad
brimming
altamaha
to
a
place
called
woodville
on
a
part
of
the
estate
named
hammersmith
though
why
that
very
thriving
suburb
of
the
great
city
of
london
should
have
been
selected
as
the
name
of
the
lonely
plank
house
in
the
midst
of
the
pine
woods
which
here
enjoys
that
title
i
can
not
conceive
unless
it
was
suggested
by
the
contrast
this
settlement
is
on
the
mainland
and
consists
apparently
merely
of
this
house
to
which
the
overseer
retires
when
the
poisonous
malaria
of
the
rice
plantations
compels
him
to
withdraw
from
it
and
a
few
deplorably
miserable
hovels
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
chiefly
occupied
by
the
most
decrepid
and
infirm
samples
of
humanity
it
was
ever
my
melancholy
lot
to
behold
the
air
of
this
pine
barren
is
salubrious
compared
with
that
of
the
rice
islands
and
here
some
of
the
oldest
slaves
who
will
not
die
yet
and
can
not
work
any
more
are
sent
to
go
as
it
were
out
of
the
way
remote
recollections
of
former
dealings
with
civilised
human
beings
in
the
shape
of
masters
and
overseers
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
only
idea
not
purely
idiotic
in
the
minds
of
the
poor
old
tottering
creatures
that
gathered
to
stare
with
dim
and
blear
eyes
at
me
and
my
children
there
were
two
very
aged
women
who
had
seen
different
and
to
their
faded
recollections
better
times
who
spoke
to
me
of
grandfather
and
of
the
early
days
of
the
plantation
when
they
were
young
and
strong
and
worked
as
their
children
and
grandchildren
were
now
working
neither
for
love
nor
yet
for
money
one
of
these
old
crones
a
hideous
withered
wrinkled
piece
of
womanhood
said
that
she
had
worked
as
long
as
her
strength
had
lasted
and
that
then
she
had
still
been
worth
her
keep
for
said
she
tho
we
no
able
to
work
we
make
little
niggers
for
massa
her
joy
at
seeing
her
present
owner
was
unbounded
and
she
kept
clapping
her
horny
hands
together
and
exclaiming
there
is
life
there
is
hope
we
seen
massa
before
we
die
these
demonstrations
of
regard
were
followed
up
by
piteous
complaints
of
hunger
and
rheumatism
and
their
usual
requests
for
pittances
of
food
and
clothing
to
which
we
responded
by
promises
of
additions
in
both
kinds
and
i
was
extricating
myself
as
well
as
i
could
from
my
petitioners
with
the
assurance
that
i
would
come
and
visit
them
again
when
i
felt
my
dress
suddenly
feebly
jerked
and
a
shrill
cracked
voice
on
the
other
side
of
me
exclaimed
no
go
yet
no
go
away
yet
you
no
see
me
missus
when
you
come
but
added
the
voice
in
a
sort
of
wail
which
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
thought
was
full
of
misery
see
many
many
of
my
offspring
these
melancholy
words
particularly
the
rather
unusual
one
at
the
end
of
the
address
struck
me
very
much
they
were
uttered
by
a
creature
which
a
woman
but
looked
like
a
crooked
figure
set
up
in
a
field
to
scare
crows
with
a
face
infinitely
more
like
a
mere
animal
than
any
human
countenance
i
ever
beheld
and
with
that
peculiar
wild
restless
look
of
indefinite
and
at
the
same
time
intense
sadness
that
is
so
remarkable
in
the
countenance
of
some
monkeys
it
was
almost
with
an
effort
that
i
commanded
myself
so
as
not
to
withdraw
my
dress
from
the
yellow
crumpled
filthy
claws
that
griped
it
and
it
was
not
at
last
without
the
authoritative
voice
of
the
overseer
that
the
poor
creature
released
her
hold
of
me
we
returned
home
certainly
in
the
very
strangest
vehicle
that
ever
civilised
gentlewoman
travelled
in
a
huge
sort
of
cart
made
only
of
some
loose
boards
on
which
i
lay
supporting
myself
against
one
of
the
four
posts
which
indicated
the
sides
of
my
carriage
six
horned
creatures
cows
or
bulls
drew
this
singular
equipage
and
a
yelping
howling
screaming
leaping
company
of
negroes
ran
all
round
them
goading
them
with
sharp
sticks
frantically
seizing
hold
of
their
tails
and
inciting
them
by
every
conceivable
and
inconceivable
encouragement
to
quick
motion
thus
like
one
of
the
ancient
merovingian
monarchs
i
was
dragged
through
the
deep
sand
from
the
settlement
back
to
the
river
where
we
reembarked
for
the
island
as
we
crossed
the
broad
flood
whose
turbid
waters
always
look
swollen
as
if
by
a
series
of
freshets
a
flight
of
birds
sprang
from
the
low
swamp
we
were
approaching
and
literally
as
it
rose
in
the
air
cast
a
shadow
like
that
of
a
cloud
which
might
be
said
with
but
little
exaggeration
to
darken
the
sun
for
a
few
seconds
how
well
i
remember
my
poor
aunt
whitelock
describing
such
phenomena
as
of
frequent
occurrence
in
america
and
the
scornful
incredulity
with
which
we
heard
without
accepting
these
legends
of
her
western
experience
how
little
i
then
thought
that
i
should
have
to
cry
peccavi
to
her
memory
from
the
bottom
of
such
ruts
and
under
the
shadow
of
such
flights
of
winged
creatures
as
she
used
to
describe
from
the
muddy
ways
of
pennsylvania
and
the
muddy
waters
of
georgia
the
vegetation
is
already
in
an
active
state
of
demonstration
sprouting
into
lovely
pale
green
and
vivid
buds
and
leaflets
though
is
yet
early
in
january
after
our
return
home
we
had
a
visit
from
c
one
of
our
neighbours
an
intelligent
and
humane
man
to
whose
account
of
the
qualities
and
characteristics
of
the
slaves
as
he
had
observed
and
experienced
them
i
listened
with
great
interest
the
brunswick
canal
was
again
the
subject
of
conversation
and
again
the
impossibility
of
allowing
the
negroes
and
irish
to
work
in
proximity
was
stated
and
admitted
as
an
indisputable
fact
it
strikes
me
with
amazement
to
hear
the
hopeless
doom
of
incapacity
for
progress
pronounced
upon
these
wretched
slaves
when
in
my
own
country
the
very
same
order
of
language
is
perpetually
applied
to
these
very
irish
here
spoken
of
as
a
sort
of
race
of
demigods
by
negro
comparison
and
it
is
most
true
that
in
ireland
nothing
can
be
more
savage
brutish
filthy
idle
and
incorrigibly
and
hopelessly
helpless
and
incapable
than
the
irish
appear
and
yet
transplanted
to
your
northern
states
freed
from
the
evil
influences
which
surround
them
at
home
they
and
their
children
become
industrious
thrifty
willing
to
learn
able
to
improve
and
forming
in
the
course
of
two
generations
a
most
valuable
accession
to
your
labouring
population
how
is
it
that
it
never
occurs
to
these
emphatical
denouncers
of
the
whole
negro
race
that
the
irish
at
home
are
esteemed
much
as
they
esteem
their
slaves
and
that
the
sentence
pronounced
against
their
whole
country
by
one
of
the
greatest
men
of
our
age
an
irishman
was
precisely
that
nothing
could
save
redeem
or
regenerate
ireland
unless
as
a
preparatory
measure
the
island
were
submerged
and
all
its
inhabitants
drowned
off
i
have
had
several
women
at
the
house
asking
for
advice
and
help
for
their
sick
children
they
all
came
from
no
as
they
call
it
that
is
the
settlement
or
cluster
of
negro
huts
nearest
to
the
main
one
where
we
may
be
said
to
reside
in
the
afternoon
i
went
thither
and
found
a
great
many
of
the
little
children
ailing
there
had
been
an
unusual
mortality
among
them
at
this
particular
settlement
this
winter
in
one
miserable
hut
i
heard
that
the
baby
was
just
dead
it
was
one
of
thirteen
many
of
whom
had
been
like
itself
mercifully
removed
from
the
life
of
degradation
and
misery
to
which
their
birth
appointed
them
and
whether
it
was
the
frequent
repetition
of
similar
losses
or
an
instinctive
consciousness
that
death
was
indeed
better
than
life
for
such
children
as
theirs
i
know
not
but
the
father
and
mother
and
old
rose
the
nurse
who
was
their
little
baby
grandmother
all
seemed
apathetic
and
apparently
indifferent
to
the
event
the
mother
merely
repeated
over
and
over
again
lost
a
many
they
all
goes
so
and
the
father
without
word
or
comment
went
out
to
his
enforced
labour
as
i
left
the
cabin
rejoicing
for
them
at
the
deliverance
out
of
slavery
of
their
poor
child
i
found
myself
suddenly
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
young
ragamuffins
in
every
stage
of
partial
nudity
clamouring
from
out
of
their
filthy
remnants
of
rags
for
donations
of
scarlet
ribbon
for
the
ball
which
was
to
take
place
that
evening
the
melancholy
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
and
the
still
sadder
reflection
it
had
given
rise
to
had
quite
driven
all
thoughts
of
the
approaching
festivity
from
my
mind
but
the
sudden
demand
for
these
graceful
luxuries
by
dependants
reminded
me
of
the
grotesque
mask
which
life
wears
on
one
of
its
mysterious
faces
and
with
as
much
sympathy
for
rejoicing
as
my
late
sympathy
for
sorrow
had
left
me
capable
of
i
procured
the
desired
ornaments
i
have
considerable
for
the
passion
for
all
shades
of
red
which
prevails
among
these
dusky
of
mine
a
savage
propensity
for
that
same
colour
in
all
its
modifications
being
a
tendency
of
my
own
at
our
own
settlement
no
i
found
everything
in
a
high
fever
of
preparation
for
the
ball
a
huge
boat
had
just
arrived
from
the
cotton
plantation
at
simons
laden
with
the
youth
and
beauty
of
that
portion
of
the
estate
who
had
been
invited
to
join
the
party
and
the
greetings
among
the
arrivers
and
welcomers
and
the
combinations
of
colour
in
the
gala
attire
of
both
surpass
all
my
powers
of
description
the
ball
to
which
of
course
we
went
took
place
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
infirmary
as
the
room
had
fortunately
but
few
occupants
they
were
removed
to
another
apartment
and
without
any
very
tender
consideration
for
their
not
very
remote
though
invisible
sufferings
the
dancing
commenced
and
was
continued
oh
my
dear
e
i
have
seen
jim
crow
the
veritable
james
all
the
contortions
and
springs
and
flings
and
kicks
and
capers
you
have
been
beguiled
into
accepting
as
indicative
of
him
are
spurious
faint
feeble
impotent
in
a
word
pale
northern
reproductions
of
that
ineffable
black
conception
it
is
impossible
for
words
to
describe
the
things
these
people
did
with
their
bodies
and
above
all
with
their
faces
the
whites
of
their
eyes
and
the
whites
of
their
teeth
and
certain
outlines
which
either
naturally
and
by
the
grace
of
heaven
or
by
the
practice
of
some
peculiar
artistic
dexterity
they
bring
into
prominent
and
most
ludicrous
display
the
languishing
elegance
of
some
the
painstaking
laboriousness
of
others
above
all
the
feats
of
a
certain
enthusiastic
who
seemed
to
me
to
thump
his
instrument
with
every
part
of
his
body
at
once
at
last
so
utterly
overcame
any
attempt
at
decorous
gravity
on
my
part
that
i
was
obliged
to
secede
and
considering
what
the
atmosphere
was
that
we
inhaled
during
the
exhibition
it
is
only
wonderful
to
me
that
we
were
not
made
ill
by
the
double
effort
not
to
laugh
and
if
possible
not
to
breathe
monday
my
dearest
e
a
rather
longer
interval
than
usual
has
elapsed
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
but
i
must
beg
you
to
excuse
it
i
have
had
more
than
a
usual
amount
of
small
daily
occupations
to
fill
my
time
and
as
a
mere
enumeration
of
these
would
not
be
very
interesting
to
you
i
will
tell
you
a
story
which
has
just
formed
an
admirable
illustration
for
my
observation
of
all
the
miseries
of
which
this
accursed
system
of
slavery
is
the
cause
even
under
the
best
and
most
humane
administration
of
its
laws
and
usages
pray
note
it
my
dear
friend
for
you
will
find
in
the
absence
of
all
voluntary
or
even
conscious
cruelty
on
the
part
of
the
master
the
best
possible
comment
on
a
state
of
things
which
without
the
slightest
desire
to
injure
and
oppress
produces
such
intolerable
results
of
injury
and
oppression
we
have
as
a
sort
of
under
nursemaid
and
assistant
of
my
dear
m
whose
white
complexion
as
i
wrote
you
occasioned
such
indignation
to
my
southern
and
such
extreme
perplexity
to
the
poor
slaves
on
our
arrival
here
a
much
more
orthodox
servant
for
these
parts
a
young
woman
named
psyche
but
commonly
called
sack
not
a
very
graceful
abbreviation
of
the
divine
heathen
appellation
she
can
not
be
much
over
twenty
has
a
very
pretty
figure
a
graceful
gentle
deportment
and
a
face
which
but
for
its
colour
she
is
a
dingy
mulatto
would
be
pretty
and
is
extremely
pleasing
from
the
perfect
sweetness
of
its
expression
she
is
always
serious
not
to
say
sad
and
silent
and
has
altogether
an
air
of
melancholy
and
timidity
that
has
frequently
struck
me
very
much
and
would
have
made
me
think
some
special
anxiety
or
sorrow
must
occasion
it
but
that
god
knows
the
whole
condition
of
these
wretched
people
naturally
produces
such
a
deportment
and
there
is
no
necessity
to
seek
for
special
or
peculiar
causes
to
account
for
it
just
in
proportion
as
i
have
found
the
slaves
on
this
plantation
intelligent
and
advanced
beyond
the
general
brutish
level
of
the
majority
i
have
observed
this
pathetic
expression
of
countenance
in
them
a
mixture
of
sadness
and
fear
the
involuntary
exhibition
of
the
two
feelings
which
i
suppose
must
be
the
predominant
experience
of
their
whole
lives
regret
and
apprehension
not
the
less
heavy
either
of
them
for
being
in
some
degree
vague
and
indefinite
a
sense
of
incalculable
past
loss
and
injury
and
a
dread
of
incalculable
future
loss
and
injury
i
have
never
questioned
psyche
as
to
her
sadness
because
in
the
first
place
as
i
tell
you
it
appears
to
me
most
natural
and
is
observable
in
all
the
slaves
whose
superior
natural
or
acquired
intelligence
allows
of
their
filling
situations
of
trust
or
service
about
the
house
and
family
and
though
i
can
not
and
will
not
refuse
to
hear
any
and
every
tale
of
suffering
which
these
unfortunates
bring
to
me
i
am
anxious
to
spare
both
myself
and
them
the
pain
of
vain
appeals
to
me
for
redress
and
help
which
alas
it
is
too
often
utterly
out
of
my
power
to
give
them
it
is
useless
and
indeed
worse
than
useless
that
they
should
see
my
impotent
indignation
and
unavailing
pity
and
hear
expressions
of
compassion
for
them
and
horror
at
their
condition
which
might
only
prove
incentives
to
a
hopeless
resistance
on
their
part
to
a
system
under
the
hideous
weight
of
whose
oppression
any
individual
or
partial
revolt
must
be
annihilated
and
ground
into
the
dust
therefore
as
i
tell
you
i
asked
psyche
no
questions
but
to
my
great
astonishment
the
other
day
m
asked
me
if
i
knew
to
whom
psyche
belonged
as
the
poor
woman
had
enquired
of
her
with
much
hesitation
and
anguish
if
she
could
tell
her
who
owned
her
and
her
children
she
has
two
nice
little
children
under
six
years
old
whom
she
keeps
as
clean
and
tidy
and
who
are
sad
and
as
silent
as
herself
my
astonishment
at
this
question
was
as
you
will
readily
believe
not
small
and
i
forthwith
sought
out
psyche
for
an
explanation
she
was
thrown
into
extreme
perturbation
at
finding
that
her
question
had
been
referred
to
me
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
sufficiently
reassure
her
to
be
able
to
comprehend
in
the
midst
of
her
reiterated
entreaties
for
pardon
and
hopes
that
she
had
not
offended
me
that
she
did
not
know
herself
who
owned
her
she
was
at
one
time
the
property
of
k
the
former
overseer
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
to
you
and
who
has
just
been
paying
a
visit
he
like
several
of
his
predecessors
in
the
management
has
contrived
to
make
a
fortune
upon
it
though
it
yearly
decreases
in
value
to
the
owners
but
this
is
the
inevitable
course
of
things
in
the
southern
states
and
has
purchased
a
plantation
of
his
own
in
alabama
i
believe
or
one
of
the
states
whether
she
still
belonged
to
k
or
not
she
did
not
know
and
entreated
me
if
she
did
to
endeavour
to
persuade
to
buy
her
now
you
must
know
that
this
poor
woman
is
the
wife
of
one
of
b
slaves
a
fine
intelligent
active
excellent
young
man
whose
whole
family
are
among
some
of
the
very
best
specimens
of
character
and
capacity
on
the
estate
i
was
so
astonished
at
the
to
me
extraordinary
state
of
things
revealed
by
poor
sack
petition
that
i
could
only
tell
her
that
i
had
supposed
all
the
negroes
on
the
plantation
were
property
but
that
i
would
certainly
enquire
and
find
out
for
her
if
i
could
to
whom
she
belonged
and
if
i
could
endeavour
to
get
to
purchase
her
if
she
really
was
not
his
now
e
just
conceive
for
one
moment
the
state
of
mind
of
this
woman
believing
herself
to
belong
to
a
man
who
in
a
few
days
was
going
down
to
one
of
those
abhorred
and
dreaded
states
and
who
would
then
compel
her
with
her
poor
little
children
to
leave
her
husband
and
the
only
home
she
had
ever
known
and
all
the
ties
of
affection
relationship
and
association
of
her
former
life
to
follow
him
thither
in
all
human
probability
never
again
to
behold
any
living
creature
that
she
had
seen
before
and
this
was
so
completely
a
matter
of
course
that
it
was
not
even
thought
necessary
to
apprise
her
positively
of
the
fact
and
the
only
thing
that
interposed
between
her
and
this
most
miserable
fate
was
the
faint
hope
that
purchased
her
and
her
children
but
if
he
had
if
this
great
deliverance
had
been
vouchsafed
to
her
the
knowledge
of
it
was
not
thought
necessary
and
with
this
deadly
dread
at
her
heart
she
was
living
day
after
day
waiting
upon
me
and
seeing
me
with
my
husband
beside
me
and
my
children
in
my
arms
in
blessed
security
safe
from
all
separation
but
the
one
reserved
in
great
providence
for
all
his
creatures
do
you
think
i
wondered
any
more
at
the
expression
of
her
countenance
or
do
you
think
it
was
easy
for
me
to
restrain
within
prudent
and
proper
limits
the
expression
of
my
feelings
at
such
a
state
of
things
and
she
had
gone
on
from
day
to
day
enduring
this
agony
till
i
suppose
its
own
intolerable
pressure
and
m
sweet
countenance
and
gentle
sympathising
voice
and
manner
had
constrained
her
to
lay
down
this
great
burden
of
sorrow
at
our
feet
i
did
not
see
until
the
evening
but
in
the
meantime
meeting
o
the
overseer
with
whom
as
i
believe
i
have
already
told
you
we
are
living
here
i
asked
him
about
psyche
and
who
was
her
proprietor
when
to
my
infinite
surprise
he
told
me
that
had
bought
her
and
her
children
from
k
who
had
offered
them
to
him
saying
that
they
would
be
rather
troublesome
to
him
than
otherwise
down
where
he
was
going
so
said
o
i
had
no
objection
to
investing
a
little
money
that
way
i
bought
them
with
a
heart
much
lightened
i
flew
to
tell
poor
psyche
the
news
so
that
at
any
rate
she
might
be
relieved
from
the
dread
of
any
immediate
separation
from
her
husband
you
can
imagine
better
than
i
can
tell
you
what
her
sensations
were
but
she
still
renewed
her
prayer
that
i
would
if
possible
induce
to
purchase
her
and
i
promised
to
do
so
early
the
next
morning
while
i
was
still
dressing
i
was
suddenly
startled
by
hearing
voices
in
loud
tones
in
which
adjoins
my
and
the
noise
increasing
until
there
was
an
absolute
cry
of
despair
uttered
by
some
man
i
could
restrain
myself
no
longer
but
opened
the
door
of
communication
and
saw
joe
the
young
man
poor
psyche
husband
raving
almost
in
a
state
of
frenzy
and
in
a
voice
broken
with
sobs
and
almost
inarticulate
with
passion
reiterating
his
determination
never
to
leave
this
plantation
never
to
go
to
alabama
never
to
leave
his
old
father
and
mother
his
poor
wife
and
children
and
dashing
his
hat
which
he
was
wringing
like
a
cloth
in
his
hands
upon
the
ground
he
declared
he
would
kill
himself
if
he
was
compelled
to
follow
k
i
glanced
from
the
poor
wretch
to
who
was
standing
leaning
against
a
table
with
his
arms
folded
occasionally
uttering
a
few
words
of
counsel
to
his
slave
to
be
quiet
and
not
fret
and
not
make
a
fuss
about
what
there
was
no
help
for
i
retreated
immediately
from
the
horrid
scene
breathless
with
surprise
and
dismay
and
stood
for
some
time
in
my
own
room
with
my
heart
and
temples
throbbing
to
such
a
degree
that
i
could
hardly
support
myself
as
soon
as
i
recovered
myself
i
again
sought
o
and
enquired
of
him
if
he
knew
the
cause
of
poor
distress
he
then
told
me
that
who
is
highly
pleased
with
k
past
administration
of
his
property
wished
on
his
departure
for
his
slave
plantation
to
give
him
some
token
of
his
satisfaction
and
made
him
a
of
the
man
joe
who
had
just
received
the
intelligence
that
he
was
to
go
down
to
alabama
with
his
new
owner
the
next
day
leaving
father
mother
wife
and
children
behind
you
will
not
wonder
that
the
man
required
a
little
judicious
soothing
under
such
circumstances
and
you
will
also
i
hope
admire
the
humanity
of
the
sale
of
his
wife
and
children
by
the
owner
who
was
going
to
take
him
to
alabama
because
would
be
incumbrances
rather
than
otherwise
down
there
if
k
did
not
do
this
after
he
knew
that
the
man
was
his
then
gave
him
to
be
carried
down
to
the
south
after
his
wife
and
children
were
sold
to
remain
in
georgia
i
do
not
know
which
was
the
real
transaction
for
i
have
not
had
the
heart
to
ask
but
you
will
easily
imagine
which
of
the
two
cases
i
prefer
believing
when
i
saw
after
this
most
wretched
story
became
known
to
me
in
all
its
details
i
appealed
to
him
for
his
own
soul
sake
not
to
commit
so
great
a
cruelty
poor
joe
agony
while
remonstrating
with
his
master
was
hardly
greater
than
mine
while
arguing
with
him
upon
this
bitter
piece
of
inhumanity
how
i
cried
and
how
i
adjured
and
how
all
my
sense
of
justice
and
of
mercy
and
of
pity
for
the
poor
wretch
and
of
wretchedness
at
finding
myself
implicated
in
such
a
state
of
things
broke
in
torrents
of
words
from
my
lips
and
tears
from
my
eyes
god
knows
such
a
sorrow
at
seeing
anyone
i
belonged
to
commit
such
an
act
was
indeed
a
new
and
terrible
experience
to
me
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
imploring
to
save
himself
more
than
to
spare
these
wretches
he
gave
me
no
answer
whatever
and
i
have
since
thought
that
the
intemperate
vehemence
of
my
entreaties
and
expostulations
perhaps
deserved
that
he
should
leave
me
as
he
did
without
one
single
word
of
reply
and
miserable
enough
i
remained
towards
evening
as
i
was
sitting
alone
my
children
having
gone
to
bed
o
came
into
the
room
i
had
but
one
subject
in
my
mind
i
had
not
been
able
to
eat
for
it
i
could
hardly
sit
still
for
the
nervous
distress
which
every
thought
of
these
poor
people
filled
me
with
as
he
sat
down
looking
over
some
accounts
i
said
to
him
you
seen
joe
this
afternoon
mr
o
i
give
you
our
conversation
as
it
took
place
he
is
a
great
deal
happier
than
he
was
this
morning
how
is
that
asked
i
eagerly
he
is
not
going
to
alabama
k
heard
that
he
had
kicked
up
a
fuss
about
it
being
in
despair
at
being
torn
from
one
wife
and
children
is
called
up
a
this
is
a
sample
of
overseer
appreciation
of
human
feelings
and
said
that
if
the
fellow
willing
to
go
with
him
he
did
not
wish
to
be
bothered
with
any
niggers
down
there
who
were
to
be
troublesome
so
he
might
stay
behind
does
psyche
know
this
i
suppose
so
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
whereas
my
needle
had
stumbled
through
the
stuff
i
was
sewing
for
an
hour
before
as
if
my
fingers
could
not
guide
it
the
regularity
and
rapidity
of
its
evolutions
were
now
quite
edifying
the
man
was
for
the
present
safe
and
i
remained
silently
pondering
his
deliverance
and
the
whole
proceeding
and
the
conduct
of
everyone
engaged
in
it
and
above
all
share
in
the
transaction
and
i
think
for
the
first
time
almost
a
sense
of
horrible
personal
responsibility
and
implication
took
hold
of
my
mind
and
i
felt
the
weight
of
an
unimagined
guilt
upon
my
conscience
and
yet
god
knows
this
feeling
of
is
very
gratuitous
on
my
part
since
when
i
married
i
knew
nothing
of
these
dreadful
possessions
of
his
and
even
if
i
had
i
should
have
been
much
puzzled
to
have
formed
any
idea
of
the
state
of
things
in
which
i
now
find
myself
plunged
together
with
those
whose
is
as
vital
to
me
almost
as
my
own
with
these
agreeable
reflections
i
went
to
bed
said
not
a
word
to
me
upon
the
subject
of
these
poor
people
all
the
next
day
and
in
the
meantime
i
became
very
impatient
of
this
reserve
on
his
part
because
i
was
dying
to
prefer
my
request
that
he
would
purchase
psyche
and
her
children
and
so
prevent
any
future
separation
between
her
and
her
husband
as
i
supposed
he
would
not
again
attempt
to
make
a
present
of
joe
at
least
to
anyone
who
did
not
wish
to
be
with
his
wife
and
children
in
the
evening
i
was
again
with
o
alone
in
the
strange
bare
sort
of
shanty
which
is
our
and
revolving
in
my
mind
the
means
of
rescuing
psyche
from
her
miserable
suspense
a
long
chain
of
all
my
possessions
in
the
shape
of
bracelets
necklaces
brooches
wound
in
glittering
procession
through
my
brain
with
many
hypothetical
calculations
of
the
value
of
each
separate
ornament
and
the
very
doubtful
probability
of
the
amount
of
the
whole
being
equal
to
the
price
of
this
poor
creature
and
her
children
and
then
the
great
power
and
privilege
i
had
foregone
of
earning
money
by
my
own
labour
occurred
to
me
and
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
my
past
profession
assumed
an
aspect
that
arrested
my
thoughts
most
seriously
for
the
last
four
years
of
my
life
that
preceded
my
marriage
i
literally
coined
money
and
never
until
this
moment
i
think
did
i
reflect
on
the
great
means
of
good
to
myself
and
others
that
i
so
gladly
agreed
to
give
up
for
ever
for
a
maintenance
by
the
unpaid
labour
of
slaves
people
toiling
not
only
unpaid
but
under
the
bitter
conditions
the
bare
contemplation
of
which
was
then
wringing
my
heart
you
will
not
wonder
that
when
in
the
midst
of
such
cogitations
i
suddenly
accosted
o
it
was
to
this
effect
o
i
have
a
particular
favour
to
beg
of
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
sell
psyche
and
her
children
without
first
letting
me
know
of
your
intention
to
do
so
and
giving
me
the
option
of
buying
them
o
is
a
remarkably
deliberate
man
and
squints
so
that
when
he
has
taken
a
little
time
in
directing
his
eyes
to
you
you
are
still
unpleasantly
unaware
of
any
result
in
which
you
are
concerned
he
laid
down
a
book
he
was
reading
and
directed
his
head
and
one
of
his
eyes
towards
me
and
answered
me
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
sold
them
my
work
fell
down
on
the
ground
and
my
mouth
opened
wide
but
i
could
utter
no
sound
i
was
so
dismayed
and
surprised
and
he
deliberately
proceeded
did
know
you
see
at
all
that
you
entertained
any
idea
of
making
an
investment
of
that
nature
for
i
sure
if
i
had
i
would
willingly
have
sold
the
woman
to
you
but
i
sold
her
and
her
children
this
morning
to
mr
my
dear
e
though
had
resented
my
unmeasured
upbraidings
you
see
they
had
not
been
without
some
good
effect
and
though
he
had
perhaps
justly
punished
my
violent
outbreak
of
indignation
about
the
miserable
scene
i
witnessed
by
not
telling
me
of
his
humane
purpose
he
had
bought
these
poor
creatures
and
so
i
trust
secured
them
from
any
such
misery
in
future
i
jumped
up
and
left
o
still
speaking
and
ran
to
find
to
thank
him
for
what
he
had
done
and
with
that
will
now
bid
you
good
bye
think
e
how
it
fares
with
slaves
on
plantations
where
there
is
no
crazy
englishwoman
to
weep
and
entreat
and
implore
and
upbraid
for
them
and
no
master
willing
to
listen
to
such
appeals
dear
e
there
is
one
privilege
which
i
enjoy
here
which
i
think
few
cockneyesses
have
ever
had
experience
of
that
of
hearing
my
own
extemporaneous
praises
chaunted
by
our
negroes
in
rhymes
as
rude
and
to
measures
as
simple
as
ever
any
illustrious
female
of
the
days
of
king
brian
boroihme
listened
to
rowing
yesterday
evening
through
a
beautiful
sunset
into
a
more
beautiful
moonrise
my
two
sable
boatmen
entertained
themselves
and
me
with
alternate
strophe
and
of
poetical
description
of
my
personal
attractions
in
which
my
recurred
repeatedly
to
my
intense
amusement
this
is
a
charm
for
the
possession
of
which
m
my
white
nursemaid
is
also
invariably
celebrated
and
i
suppose
that
the
fine
round
natural
proportions
of
the
uncompressed
waists
of
the
sable
beauties
of
these
regions
appear
less
symmetrical
to
eyes
accustomed
to
them
than
our
figures
since
pleaseth
but
rare
accidents
occasionally
i
am
celebrated
in
these
rowing
chants
as
darling
and
s
comes
in
for
endless
glorification
on
account
of
the
brilliant
beauty
of
her
complexion
the
other
day
however
our
poets
made
a
diversion
from
the
personal
to
the
moral
qualities
of
their
small
mistress
and
after
the
usual
tribute
to
her
roses
and
lilies
came
the
following
rather
significant
couplet
little
missis
sally
that
a
ruling
lady
at
which
all
the
white
teeth
simultaneously
lightened
from
the
black
visages
while
the
subject
of
this
equivocal
commendation
sat
with
infantine
solemnity
the
profoundest
i
think
that
the
human
countenance
is
capable
of
surveying
her
sable
dependants
with
imperturbable
gravity
yesterday
morning
i
amused
myself
with
an
exercise
of
a
talent
i
once
possessed
but
have
so
neglected
that
my
performance
might
almost
be
called
an
experiment
i
cut
out
a
dress
for
one
of
the
women
my
education
in
france
where
in
some
important
respects
i
think
girls
are
better
trained
than
with
us
had
sent
me
home
to
england
at
sixteen
an
adept
in
the
female
mystery
of
needlework
not
only
owing
to
the
discipline
of
clothes
mending
by
all
the
classes
while
history
of
blessed
boring
memory
was
being
read
aloud
to
prevent
babblings
and
ensure
wholesome
mental
occupation
the
while
was
i
an
expert
patcher
and
mender
darner
and
piecer
darning
and
marking
were
my
specialities
but
the
white
cotton
embroidery
of
which
every
french
woman
has
always
a
piece
under
her
hand
les
momens
which
are
thus
anything
but
was
as
familiar
to
us
as
to
the
irish
cottagers
of
the
present
day
and
cutting
out
and
making
my
dresses
was
among
the
more
advanced
branches
of
female
accomplishment
to
which
i
attained
the
luxury
of
a
lady
maid
of
my
own
indulged
in
ever
since
the
days
of
my
out
has
naturally
enough
caused
my
right
hand
to
forget
its
cunning
and
regret
and
shame
at
having
lost
any
useful
lore
in
my
life
made
me
accede
for
my
own
sake
to
the
request
of
one
of
our
multitudinous
dianas
and
innumerable
chloes
to
cut
out
dresses
for
each
of
them
especially
as
they
wonderful
to
relate
declared
themselves
able
to
stitch
them
if
i
would
do
the
cutting
since
i
have
been
on
the
plantation
i
have
already
spent
considerable
time
in
what
the
french
call
baby
bundles
the
rough
and
very
simple
tiny
habiliments
of
coarse
cotton
and
scarlet
flannel
which
form
a
layette
here
and
of
which
i
have
run
up
some
scores
but
my
present
task
was
far
more
difficult
chloe
was
an
ordinary
mortal
negress
enough
but
diana
might
have
been
the
huntress
of
the
woods
herself
done
into
the
african
type
tall
large
straight
profoundly
serious
she
stood
like
a
bronze
statue
while
i
mounted
on
a
stool
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
attain
to
the
noble
shoulders
and
bust
of
my
lay
figure
pinned
and
measured
and
cut
and
shaped
under
the
superintendence
of
m
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
fine
proportions
of
my
black
goddess
quite
becomingly
clothed
in
a
high
tight
fitting
body
of
the
gayest
chintz
which
she
really
contrived
to
put
together
quite
creditably
footnote
some
of
our
great
english
ladies
are
i
know
exquisite
needlewomen
but
i
do
not
think
in
spite
of
these
exceptional
examples
that
young
english
ladies
of
the
higher
classes
are
much
skilled
in
this
respect
at
the
present
day
and
as
for
the
democratic
daughters
of
america
who
for
many
reasons
might
be
supposed
likely
to
be
well
up
in
such
housewifely
lore
they
are
for
the
most
part
so
ignorant
of
it
that
i
have
heard
the
most
eloquent
preacher
of
the
city
of
new
york
advert
to
their
incapacity
in
this
respect
as
an
impediment
to
their
assistance
of
the
poor
and
ascribe
to
the
fact
that
the
daughters
of
his
own
parishioners
did
not
know
how
to
sew
the
impossibility
of
their
giving
the
most
valuable
species
of
help
to
the
women
of
the
needier
classes
whose
condition
could
hardly
be
more
effectually
improved
than
by
acquiring
such
useful
knowledge
i
have
known
young
american
school
girls
duly
instructed
in
the
nature
of
the
parallaxes
of
the
stars
but
as
a
rule
they
do
not
know
how
to
darn
their
stockings
les
dames
du
sacré
coeur
do
better
for
their
and
pupils
than
this
i
was
so
elated
with
my
own
part
of
this
performance
that
i
then
and
there
determined
to
put
into
execution
a
plan
i
had
long
formed
of
endowing
the
little
boat
in
which
i
take
what
the
french
call
my
walks
on
the
water
with
cushions
for
the
back
and
seat
of
the
benches
usually
occupied
by
myself
and
so
putting
on
my
large
straw
hat
and
plucking
up
a
paper
of
pins
scissors
and
my
brown
holland
i
walked
to
the
steps
and
jumping
into
the
little
canoe
began
piecing
and
measuring
and
cutting
the
cushions
which
were
to
be
stuffed
with
the
tree
moss
by
some
of
the
people
who
understand
making
a
rough
kind
of
mattress
my
inanimate
subject
however
proved
far
more
troublesome
to
fit
than
my
living
lay
figure
for
the
little
ducked
and
dived
and
rocked
and
tipped
and
curtseyed
and
tilted
as
i
knelt
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
fitting
her
till
i
was
almost
in
despair
however
i
got
a
sort
of
pattern
at
last
and
by
dint
of
some
pertinacious
efforts
which
in
their
incompleteness
did
not
escape
some
sarcastic
remarks
from
on
the
capabilities
of
of
applied
to
objects
the
matter
was
accomplished
and
the
little
dolphin
rejoiced
in
very
tidy
back
and
seat
cushions
covered
with
brown
holland
and
bound
with
green
serge
my
ambition
then
began
to
contemplate
an
awning
but
the
boat
being
of
the
nature
of
a
canoe
though
not
a
real
one
inasmuch
as
it
is
not
made
of
a
single
log
does
not
admit
of
supports
for
such
an
edifice
i
had
rather
a
fright
the
other
day
in
that
same
small
craft
into
which
i
had
taken
s
with
the
intention
of
paddling
myself
a
little
way
down
the
river
and
back
i
used
to
row
tolerably
well
and
was
very
fond
of
it
and
frequently
here
take
an
oar
when
the
men
are
rowing
me
in
the
long
boat
as
some
sort
of
equivalent
for
my
riding
of
which
of
course
i
am
entirely
deprived
on
this
little
dykeland
of
ours
but
paddling
is
a
perfectly
different
process
and
one
that
i
was
very
anxious
to
achieve
my
first
strokes
answered
the
purpose
of
sending
the
boat
off
from
shore
and
for
a
few
minutes
i
got
on
pretty
well
but
presently
i
got
tired
of
shifting
the
paddle
from
side
to
side
a
manoeuvre
which
i
accomplished
very
clumsily
and
slowly
and
yet
with
all
my
precautions
not
without
making
the
boat
tip
perilously
the
immense
breadth
and
volume
of
the
river
suddenly
seized
my
eyes
and
imagination
as
it
were
and
i
began
to
fancy
that
if
i
got
into
the
middle
of
the
stream
i
should
not
be
able
to
paddle
myself
back
against
it
which
indeed
might
very
well
have
proved
the
case
then
i
became
nervous
and
paddled
all
on
one
side
by
which
means
of
course
i
only
turned
the
boat
round
s
began
to
fidget
about
getting
up
from
where
i
had
placed
her
and
terrifying
me
with
her
unsteady
motions
and
the
rocking
of
the
canoe
i
was
now
very
much
frightened
and
saw
that
i
get
back
to
shore
before
i
became
more
helpless
than
i
was
beginning
to
feel
so
laying
s
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
as
a
preliminary
precaution
i
said
to
her
with
infinite
emphasis
lie
still
there
and
do
stir
or
you
be
drowned
to
which
with
her
clear
grey
eyes
fixed
on
me
and
no
sign
whatever
of
emotion
she
replied
deliberately
shall
lie
still
here
and
stir
for
i
should
not
like
to
be
drowned
which
for
an
atom
not
four
years
old
was
rather
philosophical
then
i
looked
about
me
and
of
course
having
drifted
set
steadily
to
work
and
paddled
home
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
almost
till
we
grazed
the
steps
and
i
got
my
precious
freight
safe
on
shore
again
since
which
i
have
taken
no
more
paddling
lessons
without
my
slave
and
master
jack
we
have
had
a
death
among
the
people
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
a
very
valuable
slave
called
shadrach
was
seized
with
a
disease
which
is
frequent
and
very
apt
to
be
fatal
here
and
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
done
to
save
him
sank
rapidly
and
died
after
an
acute
illness
of
only
three
days
the
doctor
came
repeatedly
from
darien
and
the
last
night
of
the
poor
fellow
life
himself
watched
with
him
i
suppose
the
general
low
diet
of
the
negroes
must
produce
some
want
of
stamina
in
them
certainly
either
from
natural
constitution
or
the
effect
of
their
habits
of
existence
or
both
it
is
astonishing
how
much
less
power
of
resistance
to
disease
they
seem
to
possess
than
we
do
if
they
are
ill
the
vital
energy
seems
to
sink
immediately
this
rice
cultivation
too
although
it
does
not
affect
them
as
it
would
whites
to
whom
indeed
residence
on
the
rice
plantation
after
a
certain
season
is
impossible
is
still
to
a
certain
degree
deleterious
even
to
the
negroes
the
proportion
of
sick
is
always
greater
here
than
on
the
cotton
plantation
and
the
invalids
of
this
place
are
not
unfrequently
sent
down
to
simon
to
recover
their
strength
under
the
more
favourable
influences
of
the
sea
air
and
dry
sandy
soil
of
hampton
point
yesterday
afternoon
the
tepid
warmth
of
the
air
and
glassy
stillness
of
the
river
seemed
to
me
highly
suggestive
of
fishing
and
i
determined
not
having
yet
discovered
what
i
could
catch
with
what
in
these
unknown
waters
to
try
a
little
innocent
paste
bait
a
mystery
his
initiation
into
which
caused
jack
much
wonderment
the
only
hooks
i
had
with
me
however
had
been
bought
in
darien
made
i
should
think
at
the
north
expressly
for
this
market
and
so
villanously
bad
were
they
that
after
trying
them
and
my
patience
a
reasonable
time
i
gave
up
the
attempt
and
took
a
lesson
in
paddling
instead
amongst
other
items
jack
told
me
of
his
own
fishing
experience
was
that
he
had
more
than
once
caught
those
most
excellent
creatures
altamaha
shad
by
the
fish
themselves
leaping
out
of
the
water
and
as
jack
expressed
it
to
escape
from
the
porpoises
which
come
in
large
schools
up
the
river
to
a
considerable
distance
occasioning
evidently
much
emotion
in
the
bosoms
of
the
legitimate
inhabitants
of
these
muddy
waters
coasting
the
island
on
our
return
home
we
found
a
trap
which
the
last
time
we
examined
it
was
tenanted
by
a
creature
called
a
mink
now
occupied
by
an
otter
the
poor
beast
did
not
seem
pleased
with
his
predicament
but
the
trap
had
been
set
by
one
of
the
drivers
and
of
course
jack
would
not
have
meddled
with
it
except
upon
my
express
order
which
in
spite
of
some
pangs
of
pity
for
the
otter
i
did
not
like
to
give
him
as
in
the
extremely
few
resources
of
either
profit
or
pleasure
possessed
by
the
slaves
i
could
not
tell
at
all
what
might
be
the
value
of
an
otter
to
his
captor
yesterday
evening
the
burial
of
the
poor
man
shadrach
took
place
i
had
been
applied
to
for
a
sufficient
quantity
of
cotton
cloth
to
make
a
for
him
and
just
as
the
twilight
was
thickening
into
darkness
i
went
with
to
the
cottage
of
one
of
the
slaves
whom
i
may
have
mentioned
to
you
before
a
cooper
of
the
name
of
london
the
head
of
the
religious
party
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
a
methodist
preacher
of
no
small
intelligence
and
influence
among
the
people
who
was
to
perform
the
burial
service
the
coffin
was
laid
on
trestles
in
front
of
the
cooper
cottage
and
a
large
assemblage
of
the
people
had
gathered
round
many
of
the
men
carrying
torches
the
fitful
glare
of
which
glanced
over
the
strange
assembly
where
every
pair
of
large
eyes
turned
upon
and
myself
we
two
poor
creatures
on
this
more
solemn
occasion
as
well
as
on
every
other
when
these
people
encounter
us
being
the
objects
of
admiration
and
wonderment
on
which
their
gaze
is
immovably
riveted
presently
the
whole
congregation
uplifted
their
voices
in
a
hymn
the
first
high
wailing
notes
of
which
sung
all
in
unison
in
the
midst
of
these
unwonted
surroundings
sent
a
thrill
through
all
my
nerves
when
the
chant
ceased
cooper
london
began
a
prayer
and
all
the
people
knelt
down
in
the
sand
as
i
did
also
alone
remained
standing
in
the
presence
of
the
dead
man
and
of
the
living
god
to
whom
his
slaves
were
now
appealing
i
can
not
tell
you
how
profoundly
the
whole
ceremony
if
such
it
could
be
called
affected
me
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
simple
and
pathetic
supplication
of
the
poor
black
artisan
to
check
or
interfere
with
the
solemn
influences
of
the
whole
scene
it
was
a
sort
of
conventional
methodist
prayer
and
probably
quite
as
conventional
as
all
the
rest
was
the
closing
invocation
of
god
blessing
upon
their
master
their
mistress
and
our
children
but
this
fairly
overcame
my
composure
and
i
began
to
cry
very
bitterly
for
these
same
individuals
whose
implication
in
the
state
of
things
in
the
midst
of
which
we
are
living
seemed
to
me
as
legitimate
a
cause
for
tears
as
for
prayers
when
the
prayer
was
concluded
we
all
rose
and
the
coffin
being
taken
up
proceeded
to
the
people
when
london
read
aloud
portions
of
the
funeral
service
from
the
i
presume
the
american
episcopal
version
of
our
church
service
for
what
he
read
appeared
to
be
merely
a
selection
from
what
was
perfectly
familiar
to
me
but
whether
he
himself
extracted
what
he
uttered
i
did
not
enquire
indeed
i
was
too
much
absorbed
in
the
whole
scene
and
the
many
mingled
emotions
it
excited
of
awe
and
pity
and
an
indescribable
sensation
of
wonder
at
finding
myself
on
this
slave
soil
surrounded
by
my
slaves
among
whom
again
i
knelt
while
the
words
proclaiming
to
the
living
and
the
dead
the
everlasting
covenant
of
freedom
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
sounded
over
the
prostrate
throng
and
mingled
with
the
heavy
flowing
of
the
vast
river
sweeping
not
far
from
where
we
stood
through
the
darkness
by
which
we
were
now
encompassed
beyond
the
immediate
circle
of
our
there
was
something
painful
to
me
in
standing
while
we
all
knelt
on
the
earth
for
though
in
any
church
in
philadelphia
he
would
have
stood
during
the
praying
of
any
minister
here
i
wished
he
would
have
knelt
to
have
given
his
slaves
some
token
of
his
belief
that
at
least
in
the
sight
of
that
master
to
whom
we
were
addressing
our
worship
all
men
are
equal
the
service
ended
with
a
short
address
from
london
upon
the
subject
of
lazarus
and
the
confirmation
which
the
story
of
his
resurrection
afforded
our
hopes
the
words
were
simple
and
rustic
and
of
course
uttered
in
the
peculiar
sort
of
jargon
which
is
the
habitual
negro
speech
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
slightest
degree
incongruous
or
grotesque
in
the
matter
or
manner
and
the
exhortations
not
to
steal
or
lie
or
neglect
to
work
well
for
massa
with
which
the
glorious
hope
of
immortality
was
blended
in
the
poor
slave
preacher
closing
address
was
a
moral
adaptation
as
wholesome
as
it
was
touching
of
the
great
christian
theory
to
the
capacities
and
consciences
of
his
hearers
when
the
coffin
was
lowered
the
grave
was
found
to
be
partially
filled
with
water
naturally
enough
for
the
whole
island
is
a
mere
swamp
off
which
the
altamaha
is
only
kept
from
sweeping
by
the
high
dykes
all
round
it
this
seemed
to
shock
and
distress
the
people
and
for
the
first
time
during
the
whole
ceremony
there
were
sounds
of
crying
and
exclamations
of
grief
heard
among
them
their
chief
expression
of
sorrow
however
when
and
myself
bade
them
good
night
at
the
conclusion
of
the
service
was
on
account
of
my
crying
which
appeared
to
affect
them
very
much
many
of
them
mingling
with
their
good
night
massa
and
missis
affectionate
exclamations
of
bless
you
missis
do
cry
missis
do
you
cry
so
declined
the
assistance
of
any
of
the
home
and
bade
them
all
go
quietly
to
their
quarters
and
as
soon
as
they
had
dispersed
and
we
had
got
beyond
the
fitful
and
unequal
glaring
of
the
torches
we
found
the
shining
of
the
stars
in
the
deep
blue
lovely
night
sky
quite
sufficient
to
light
our
way
along
the
dykes
i
could
not
speak
to
but
continued
to
cry
as
we
walked
silently
home
and
whatever
his
cogitations
were
they
did
not
take
the
unusual
form
with
him
of
wordy
demonstration
and
so
we
returned
from
one
of
the
most
striking
religious
ceremonies
at
which
i
ever
assisted
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
house
we
perceived
that
we
had
been
followed
the
whole
way
by
the
naked
noiseless
feet
of
a
poor
creature
a
female
idiot
whose
mental
incapacity
of
course
in
no
respect
unfits
her
for
the
life
of
toil
little
more
intellectual
than
that
of
any
beast
of
burthen
which
is
her
allotted
portion
here
some
small
gratification
was
given
to
her
and
she
departed
gibbering
and
muttering
in
high
glee
think
e
of
that
man
london
who
in
spite
of
all
the
bitter
barriers
in
his
way
has
learnt
to
read
has
read
his
bible
teaches
it
to
his
unfortunate
fellows
and
is
used
by
his
owner
and
his
owner
agents
for
all
these
causes
as
an
effectual
influence
for
good
over
the
slaves
of
whom
he
is
himself
the
despised
and
injured
companion
like
them
subject
to
the
driver
lash
like
them
the
helpless
creature
of
his
despotic
will
without
a
right
or
a
hope
in
this
dreary
world
but
though
the
light
he
has
attained
must
show
him
the
terrible
aspects
of
his
fate
hidden
by
blessed
ignorance
from
his
companions
it
reveals
to
him
also
other
rights
and
other
hopes
another
world
another
life
towards
which
he
leads
according
to
the
grace
vouchsafed
him
his
poor
how
can
we
keep
this
man
in
such
a
condition
how
is
such
a
cruel
sin
of
injustice
to
be
answered
of
course
sees
and
feels
none
of
this
as
i
do
and
i
should
think
must
regret
that
he
ever
brought
me
here
to
have
my
abhorrence
of
the
theory
of
slavery
deepened
and
strengthened
every
hour
of
my
life
by
what
i
see
of
its
practice
this
morning
i
went
over
to
darien
upon
the
very
female
errands
of
returning
visits
and
shopping
in
one
respect
assuredly
in
none
other
our
life
here
resembles
existence
in
venice
we
can
never
leave
home
for
any
purpose
or
in
any
direction
but
by
boat
not
indeed
by
gondola
but
the
sharp
cut
well
made
light
craft
in
which
we
take
our
walks
on
the
water
is
a
very
agreeable
species
of
conveyance
one
of
my
visits
this
morning
was
to
a
certain
miss
whose
rather
grandiloquent
name
and
very
striking
style
of
beauty
exceedingly
well
became
the
daughter
of
an
of
georgia
as
for
the
residence
of
this
princess
it
was
like
all
the
planters
residences
that
i
have
seen
and
such
as
a
english
farmer
would
certainly
not
inhabit
occasional
marks
of
former
elegance
or
splendour
survive
sometimes
in
the
size
of
the
rooms
sometimes
in
a
little
carved
about
the
mantelpieces
or
wainscoatings
of
these
mansions
but
all
things
have
a
castle
rackrent
air
of
neglect
and
dreary
careless
untidiness
with
which
the
dirty
negro
servants
are
in
excellent
keeping
occasionally
a
huge
pair
of
dazzling
shirt
gills
out
of
which
a
black
visage
grins
as
out
of
some
vast
white
paper
cornet
adorns
the
sable
footman
of
the
establishment
but
unfortunately
without
at
all
necessarily
indicating
any
downward
prolongation
of
the
garment
and
the
perfect
tulip
bed
of
a
head
handkerchief
with
which
the
female
attendants
of
these
love
to
bedizen
themselves
frequently
stands
them
instead
of
every
other
most
indispensable
article
of
female
attire
as
for
my
shopping
the
goods
or
rather
at
which
i
used
to
grumble
in
your
village
emporium
at
lenox
are
what
may
be
termed
rate
both
in
excellence
and
elegance
compared
with
the
vile
products
of
every
sort
which
we
wretched
southerners
are
expected
to
accept
as
the
conveniences
of
life
in
exchange
for
current
coin
of
the
realm
i
regret
to
say
moreover
that
all
these
infamous
articles
are
yankee
made
expressly
for
this
market
where
every
species
of
to
use
the
most
general
term
i
can
think
of
from
list
shoes
to
pianofortes
is
procured
from
the
north
almost
always
new
england
utterly
worthless
of
its
kind
and
dearer
than
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
the
same
articles
would
be
anywhere
else
the
incredible
variety
and
ludicrous
combinations
of
goods
to
be
met
with
in
one
of
these
southern
shops
beats
the
stock
of
your
village
hollow
to
be
sure
one
class
of
articles
and
that
probably
the
most
in
demand
here
is
not
sold
over
any
counter
in
massachussetts
and
of
which
a
large
assortment
enters
necessarily
into
the
furniture
of
every
southern
shop
in
passing
along
the
deep
sand
road
calling
itself
the
street
of
darien
my
notice
was
attracted
by
an
extremely
handsome
and
poodle
standing
by
a
little
whose
features
were
evidently
european
though
he
was
nearly
as
black
as
a
negro
who
strange
to
say
was
discoursing
with
him
in
very
tolerable
french
the
impulse
of
curiosity
led
me
to
accost
the
man
at
the
grindstone
when
his
companion
immediately
made
off
the
itinerant
artisan
was
from
aix
in
provence
think
of
wandering
thence
to
darien
in
georgia
i
asked
him
about
the
negro
who
was
talking
to
him
he
said
he
knew
nothing
of
him
but
that
he
was
a
slave
belonging
to
somebody
in
the
town
and
upon
my
expressing
surprise
at
his
having
left
his
own
beautiful
and
pleasant
country
for
this
dreary
distant
region
he
answered
with
a
shrug
and
a
smile
madame
vrai
un
joli
pays
mais
dans
ce
quand
un
homme
rien
rien
pour
toujours
a
property
which
many
no
doubt
have
come
hither
like
the
little
french
to
increase
without
succeeding
in
the
struggle
much
better
than
he
appeared
to
have
done
dear
e
having
made
a
fresh
and
as
i
thought
more
promising
purchase
of
jack
and
i
betook
ourselves
to
the
river
and
succeeded
in
securing
some
immense
of
which
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
most
horribly
afraid
when
i
have
caught
them
the
dexterity
necessary
for
taking
them
off
the
hook
so
as
to
avoid
the
spikes
on
their
backs
and
the
spikes
on
each
side
of
their
gills
the
former
having
to
be
pressed
down
and
the
two
others
pressed
up
before
you
can
get
any
purchase
on
the
slimy
beast
for
it
is
smooth
skinned
and
without
scales
to
add
to
the
difficulty
these
conditions
i
say
make
the
catching
of
questionable
sport
then
too
they
hiss
and
spit
and
swear
at
one
and
are
altogether
devilish
in
their
aspect
and
demeanour
nor
are
they
good
for
food
except
as
jack
with
much
humility
said
this
morning
for
coloured
folks
for
coloured
folks
missis
me
not
good
enough
for
white
people
that
meaning
has
sometimes
a
possible
meaning
of
which
would
give
the
sentence
in
which
it
occurs
a
very
humorous
turn
and
i
always
take
the
benefit
of
that
interpretation
after
exhausting
the
charms
of
our
occupation
finding
that
were
likely
to
be
our
principal
haul
i
left
the
river
and
went
my
rounds
to
the
hospitals
on
my
way
i
encountered
two
batches
of
small
black
fry
hannah
children
and
poor
psyche
children
looking
really
as
neat
and
tidy
as
children
of
the
bettermost
class
of
artisans
among
ourselves
these
people
are
so
quick
and
so
imitative
that
it
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
improve
their
physical
condition
by
appealing
to
their
emulative
propensities
their
passion
for
what
is
might
be
used
most
advantageously
in
the
same
direction
and
indeed
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
people
who
offered
such
a
fair
purchase
by
so
many
of
their
characteristics
to
the
hand
of
the
reformer
returning
from
the
hospital
i
was
accosted
by
poor
old
teresa
the
wretched
negress
who
had
complained
to
me
so
grievously
of
her
back
being
broken
by
hard
work
and
she
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
excitement
which
she
partly
presently
communicated
to
me
because
she
said
o
had
ordered
her
to
be
flogged
for
having
complained
to
me
as
she
did
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
come
down
here
to
be
tortured
for
this
punishing
these
wretched
creatures
for
crying
out
to
me
for
help
is
really
converting
me
into
a
source
of
increased
misery
to
them
it
is
almost
more
than
i
can
endure
to
hear
these
horrid
stories
of
lashings
inflicted
because
i
have
been
invoked
and
though
i
dare
say
thanks
to
my
passionate
appeals
to
him
gives
me
little
credit
for
prudence
or
i
have
some
and
i
exercise
it
too
when
i
listen
to
such
tales
as
these
with
my
teeth
set
fast
and
my
lips
closed
whatever
i
may
do
to
the
master
i
hold
my
tongue
to
the
slaves
and
i
wonder
how
i
do
it
in
the
afternoon
i
rowed
with
to
another
island
in
the
broad
waters
of
the
altamaha
called
tunno
island
to
return
the
visit
of
a
certain
t
the
proprietor
of
the
island
named
after
him
as
our
rice
swamp
is
after
major
i
here
saw
growing
in
the
open
air
the
most
beautiful
gardinias
i
ever
beheld
the
branches
were
as
high
and
as
thick
as
the
largest
clumps
of
kalmia
that
grow
in
your
woods
but
whereas
the
tough
stringy
fibrous
branches
of
these
gives
them
a
straggling
appearance
these
magnificent
masses
of
dark
shiny
glossy
green
leaves
were
quite
compact
and
i
can
not
conceive
anything
lovelier
or
more
delightful
than
they
would
be
starred
all
over
with
their
odoriferous
blossoms
in
the
course
of
our
visit
a
discussion
arose
as
to
the
credibility
of
any
negro
assertion
though
indeed
that
could
hardly
be
called
a
discussion
that
was
simply
a
chorus
of
assenting
opinions
no
negro
was
to
be
believed
on
any
occasion
or
any
subject
no
doubt
they
are
habitual
liars
for
they
are
slaves
but
there
are
some
thrice
honourable
exceptions
who
being
slaves
are
yet
not
liars
and
certainly
the
vice
results
much
more
from
the
circumstances
in
which
they
are
placed
than
from
any
natural
tendency
to
untruth
in
their
case
the
truth
is
that
they
are
always
considered
as
false
and
deceitful
and
it
is
very
seldom
that
any
special
investigation
of
the
facts
of
any
particular
case
is
resorted
to
in
their
behalf
they
are
always
prejudged
on
their
supposed
general
characteristics
and
never
judged
after
the
fact
on
the
merit
of
any
special
instance
a
question
which
was
discussed
in
the
real
sense
of
the
term
was
that
of
ploughing
the
land
instead
of
having
it
turned
with
the
spade
or
hoe
i
listened
to
this
with
great
interest
for
jack
and
i
had
had
some
talk
upon
this
subject
which
began
in
his
ardently
expressed
wish
that
massa
would
allow
his
land
to
be
ploughed
and
his
despairing
conclusion
that
he
never
would
horses
more
costly
to
keep
than
coloured
folks
and
ploughing
therefore
dearer
than
hoeing
or
digging
i
had
ventured
to
suggest
to
the
possibility
of
ploughing
some
of
the
fields
on
the
island
and
his
reply
was
that
the
whole
land
was
too
moist
and
too
much
interrupted
with
the
huge
masses
of
the
cypress
yam
roots
which
would
turn
the
share
of
any
plough
yet
there
is
land
belonging
to
our
neighbour
g
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
where
the
conditions
of
the
soil
must
be
precisely
the
same
and
yet
which
is
being
ploughed
before
our
faces
on
adjacent
plantation
the
plough
is
also
used
extensively
and
successfully
on
my
return
to
our
own
island
i
visited
another
of
the
hospitals
and
the
settlements
to
which
it
belonged
the
condition
of
these
places
and
of
their
inhabitants
is
of
course
the
same
all
over
the
plantation
and
if
i
were
to
describe
them
i
should
but
weary
you
with
a
repetition
of
identical
phenomena
filthy
wretched
almost
naked
always
and
children
negligent
ignorant
wretched
mothers
whose
apparent
indifference
to
the
plight
of
their
offspring
and
utter
incapacity
to
alter
it
are
the
inevitable
result
of
their
slavery
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
reform
their
habits
or
improve
their
condition
while
the
women
are
condemned
to
field
labour
nor
is
it
possible
to
overestimate
the
bad
moral
effect
of
the
system
as
regards
the
women
entailing
this
enforced
separation
from
their
children
and
neglect
of
all
the
cares
and
duties
of
mother
nurse
and
even
which
are
all
merged
in
the
mere
physical
toil
of
a
human
hoeing
machine
it
seems
to
me
too
but
upon
this
point
i
can
not
of
course
judge
as
well
as
the
persons
accustomed
to
and
acquainted
with
the
physical
capacities
of
their
slaves
that
the
labour
is
not
judiciously
distributed
in
many
cases
at
least
not
as
far
as
the
women
are
concerned
it
is
true
that
every
woman
is
made
the
most
of
in
being
driven
as
long
as
under
all
and
any
circumstances
she
is
able
to
wield
a
hoe
but
on
the
other
hand
stout
hale
hearty
girls
and
boys
of
from
eight
to
twelve
and
older
are
allowed
to
lounge
about
filthy
and
idle
with
no
pretence
of
an
occupation
but
what
they
call
baby
see
to
the
life
and
limbs
of
the
little
slave
infants
to
whose
mothers
working
in
distant
fields
they
carry
them
during
the
day
to
be
suckled
and
for
the
rest
of
the
time
leave
them
to
crawl
and
kick
in
the
filthy
cabins
or
on
the
broiling
sand
which
surrounds
them
in
which
industry
excellent
enough
for
the
poor
babies
these
big
lazy
youths
and
lasses
emulate
them
again
i
find
many
women
who
have
borne
from
five
to
ten
children
rated
as
workers
precisely
as
young
women
in
the
prime
of
their
strength
who
have
had
none
this
seems
a
cruel
carelessness
to
be
sure
while
the
women
are
pregnant
their
task
is
diminished
and
this
is
one
of
the
many
indirect
inducements
held
out
to
reckless
propagation
which
has
a
sort
of
premium
offered
to
it
in
the
consideration
of
less
work
and
more
food
counterbalanced
by
none
of
the
sacred
responsibilities
which
hallow
and
ennoble
the
relation
of
parent
and
child
in
short
as
their
lives
are
for
the
most
part
those
of
mere
animals
their
increase
is
literally
mere
animal
breeding
to
which
every
encouragement
is
given
for
it
adds
to
the
master
live
stock
and
the
value
of
his
estate
dear
e
i
have
the
pleasure
of
announcing
to
you
a
variety
of
improvements
about
to
be
made
in
the
infirmary
of
the
island
there
is
to
be
a
third
story
a
mere
loft
indeed
added
to
the
buildings
but
by
affording
more
room
for
the
least
distressing
cases
of
sickness
to
be
drafted
off
into
it
will
leave
the
and
room
above
it
comparatively
free
for
the
most
miserable
of
these
unfortunates
to
my
unspeakable
satisfaction
these
destitute
apartments
are
to
be
furnished
with
bedsteads
mattresses
pillows
and
blankets
and
i
feel
a
little
comforted
for
the
many
my
life
here
inflicts
upon
me
at
least
some
of
my
twinges
will
have
wrought
this
poor
alleviation
of
their
wretchedness
for
the
slaves
when
prostrated
by
disease
or
pain
i
had
hardly
time
to
return
from
the
hospital
home
this
morning
before
one
of
the
most
tremendous
storms
i
ever
saw
burst
over
the
island
your
northern
hills
with
their
solemn
pine
woods
and
fresh
streams
and
lakes
telling
of
a
cold
rather
than
a
warm
climate
always
seem
to
me
as
if
undergoing
some
strange
and
unnatural
visitation
when
one
of
your
heavy
summer
bursts
over
them
snow
and
frost
hail
and
above
all
wind
trailing
rain
clouds
and
brilliant
northern
lights
are
your
appropriate
sky
phenomena
here
thunder
and
lightning
seem
as
if
they
might
have
been
invented
even
in
winter
remember
we
are
now
in
february
they
appear
neither
astonishing
nor
unseasonable
and
i
should
think
in
summer
but
heaven
defend
me
from
ever
making
good
my
supposition
lightning
must
be
as
familiar
to
these
sweltering
lands
and
slimy
waters
as
sunlight
itself
the
afternoon
cleared
off
most
beautifully
and
jack
and
i
went
out
on
the
river
to
catch
what
might
be
caught
jack
joyful
excitement
was
extreme
at
my
announcing
to
him
the
fact
that
had
consented
to
try
ploughing
on
some
of
the
driest
portions
of
the
island
instead
of
the
slow
and
laborious
process
of
hoeing
the
fields
this
is
a
disinterested
exultation
on
his
part
for
at
any
rate
as
long
as
i
am
here
he
will
certainly
be
nothing
but
boy
jack
and
i
should
think
after
my
departure
will
never
be
degraded
to
the
rank
of
a
or
common
labourer
indeed
the
delicacy
of
his
health
to
which
his
slight
slender
figure
and
languid
face
bear
witness
and
which
was
one
reason
of
his
appointment
to
the
eminence
of
being
slave
would
i
should
think
prevent
the
poor
fellow
ever
being
a
very
robust
or
useful
working
animal
on
my
return
from
the
river
i
had
a
long
and
painful
conversation
with
upon
the
subject
of
the
flogging
which
had
been
inflicted
on
the
wretched
teresa
these
discussions
are
terrible
they
throw
me
into
perfect
agonies
of
distress
for
the
slaves
whose
position
is
utterly
hopeless
for
myself
whose
intervention
in
their
behalf
sometimes
seems
to
me
worse
than
useless
for
whose
share
in
this
horrible
system
fills
me
by
turns
with
indignation
and
pity
but
after
all
what
can
he
do
how
can
he
help
it
all
moreover
born
and
bred
in
america
how
should
he
care
or
wish
to
help
it
and
of
course
he
does
not
and
i
am
in
despair
that
he
does
not
et
voilà
it
is
a
happy
and
hopeful
plight
for
us
both
he
maintained
that
there
had
been
neither
hardship
nor
injustice
in
the
case
of
teresa
flogging
and
that
moreover
she
had
not
been
flogged
at
all
for
complaining
to
me
but
simply
because
her
allotted
task
was
not
done
at
the
appointed
time
of
course
this
was
the
result
of
her
having
come
to
appeal
to
me
instead
of
going
to
her
labour
and
as
she
knew
perfectly
well
the
penalty
she
was
incurring
he
maintained
that
there
was
neither
hardship
nor
injustice
in
the
case
the
whole
thing
was
a
regularly
established
law
with
which
all
the
slaves
were
perfectly
well
acquainted
and
this
case
was
no
exception
whatever
the
circumstance
of
my
being
on
the
island
could
not
of
course
be
allowed
to
overthrow
the
whole
system
of
discipline
established
to
secure
the
labour
and
obedience
of
the
slaves
and
if
they
chose
to
try
experiments
as
to
that
fact
they
and
i
must
take
the
consequences
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
driver
of
the
gang
to
which
teresa
belongs
reported
her
work
not
done
and
o
ordered
him
to
give
her
the
usual
number
of
stripes
which
order
the
driver
of
course
obeyed
without
knowing
how
teresa
had
employed
her
time
instead
of
hoeing
but
o
knew
well
enough
for
the
wretched
woman
told
me
that
she
had
herself
told
him
she
should
appeal
to
me
about
her
weakness
and
suffering
and
inability
to
do
the
work
exacted
from
her
he
did
not
however
think
proper
to
exceed
in
her
punishment
the
usual
number
of
stripes
allotted
to
the
of
the
appointed
daily
task
and
pronounced
the
whole
transaction
perfectly
satisfactory
and
the
common
drivers
are
limited
in
their
powers
of
chastisement
not
being
allowed
to
administer
more
than
a
certain
number
of
lashes
to
their
fellow
slaves
head
man
frank
as
he
is
called
has
alone
the
privilege
of
exceeding
this
limit
and
the
overseer
latitude
of
infliction
is
only
curtailed
by
the
necessity
of
avoiding
injury
to
life
or
limb
the
master
irresponsible
power
has
no
such
bound
when
i
was
thus
silenced
on
the
particular
case
under
discussion
i
resorted
in
my
distress
and
indignation
to
the
abstract
question
as
i
never
can
refrain
from
doing
and
to
assertion
of
the
justice
of
poor
teresa
punishment
i
retorted
the
manifest
injustice
of
unpaid
and
enforced
labour
the
brutal
inhumanity
of
allowing
a
man
to
strip
and
lash
a
woman
the
mother
of
ten
children
to
exact
from
her
toil
which
was
to
maintain
in
luxury
two
idle
young
men
the
owners
of
the
plantation
i
said
i
thought
female
labour
of
the
sort
exacted
from
these
slaves
and
corporal
chastisement
such
as
they
endure
must
be
abhorrent
to
any
manly
or
humane
man
said
he
thought
it
was
and
left
me
to
my
reflections
with
that
concession
my
letter
has
been
interrupted
for
the
last
three
days
by
nothing
special
however
my
occupations
and
interests
here
of
course
know
no
change
but
has
been
anxious
for
a
little
while
past
that
we
should
go
down
to
simon
the
cotton
plantation
we
shall
suffer
less
from
the
heat
which
i
am
beginning
to
find
oppressive
on
this
swamp
island
and
he
himself
wished
to
visit
that
part
of
his
property
whither
he
had
not
yet
been
since
our
arrival
in
georgia
so
the
day
before
yesterday
he
departed
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
our
removal
thither
and
my
time
in
the
meanwhile
has
been
taken
up
in
fitting
him
out
for
his
departure
in
the
morning
jack
and
i
took
our
usual
paddle
and
having
the
tackle
on
board
tried
fishing
i
was
absorbed
in
many
sad
and
serious
considerations
and
wonderful
to
relate
for
you
know
how
keen
an
angler
i
am
had
lost
all
consciousness
of
my
occupation
until
after
i
know
not
how
long
a
time
elapsing
without
the
shadow
of
a
nibble
i
was
recalled
to
a
most
ludicrous
perception
of
my
by
sudden
observation
fishing
berry
good
fun
when
um
fish
bite
this
settled
the
fishing
for
that
morning
and
i
let
jack
paddle
me
down
the
broad
turbid
stream
endeavouring
to
answer
in
the
most
comprehensible
manner
to
his
keen
but
utterly
undeveloped
intellects
the
innumerable
questions
with
which
he
plied
me
about
philadelphia
about
england
about
the
atlantic
he
dilated
much
upon
the
charms
of
simon
to
which
he
appeared
very
glad
that
we
were
going
and
among
other
items
of
description
mentioned
what
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
it
was
a
beautiful
place
for
riding
and
that
i
should
be
able
to
indulge
to
my
heart
content
in
my
favourite
exercise
from
which
i
have
of
course
been
utterly
debarred
in
this
small
dykeland
of
ours
he
insinuated
more
than
once
his
hope
and
desire
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
accompany
me
but
as
i
knew
nothing
at
all
about
his
capacity
for
equestrian
exercises
or
any
of
the
arrangements
that
might
or
might
not
interfere
with
such
a
plan
i
was
discreetly
silent
and
took
no
notice
of
his
most
comically
turned
hints
on
the
subject
in
our
row
we
started
a
quantity
of
wild
duck
and
he
told
me
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
game
at
simon
but
that
the
people
did
not
contrive
to
catch
much
though
they
laid
traps
constantly
for
it
of
course
their
possessing
firearms
is
quite
out
of
the
question
but
this
abundance
of
what
must
be
to
them
such
especially
desirable
prey
makes
the
fact
a
great
hardship
i
almost
wonder
they
do
learn
to
shoot
like
savages
with
bows
and
arrows
but
these
would
be
weapons
and
equally
forbidden
them
in
the
afternoon
i
saw
off
for
simon
it
is
fifteen
miles
lower
down
the
river
and
a
large
island
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
altamaha
the
boat
he
went
in
was
a
large
broad
rather
heavy
though
craft
by
no
means
as
swift
or
elegant
as
the
narrow
long
boat
in
which
he
generally
takes
his
walks
on
the
water
but
well
adapted
for
the
traffic
between
the
two
plantations
where
it
serves
the
purpose
of
a
sort
of
omnibus
or
for
the
transfer
of
the
people
from
one
to
the
other
and
of
a
baggage
waggon
or
cart
for
the
conveyance
of
all
sorts
of
household
goods
chattels
and
necessaries
sat
in
the
middle
of
a
perfect
chaos
of
such
freight
and
as
the
boat
pushed
off
and
the
steersman
took
her
into
the
stream
the
men
at
the
oars
set
up
a
chorus
which
they
continued
to
chaunt
in
unison
with
each
other
and
in
time
with
their
stroke
till
the
voices
and
oars
were
heard
no
more
from
the
distance
i
believe
i
have
mentioned
to
you
before
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
this
veritable
negro
minstrelsy
how
they
all
sing
in
unison
having
never
it
appears
attempted
or
heard
anything
like
their
voices
seem
oftener
tenor
than
any
other
quality
and
the
tune
and
time
they
keep
something
quite
wonderful
such
truth
of
intonation
and
accent
would
make
almost
any
music
agreeable
that
which
i
have
heard
these
people
sing
is
often
plaintive
and
pretty
but
almost
always
has
some
resemblance
to
tunes
with
which
they
must
have
become
acquainted
through
the
instrumentality
of
white
men
their
overseers
or
masters
whistling
scotch
or
irish
airs
of
which
they
have
produced
by
ear
these
the
note
for
note
reproduction
of
vous
maman
in
one
of
the
most
popular
of
the
negro
melodies
with
which
all
america
and
england
are
familiar
is
an
example
of
this
very
transparent
plagiarism
and
the
tune
with
which
rowers
started
him
down
the
altamaha
as
i
stood
at
the
steps
to
see
him
off
was
a
very
distinct
descendant
of
through
the
rye
the
words
however
were
astonishingly
primitive
especially
the
first
line
which
when
it
burst
from
their
eight
throats
in
high
unison
sent
me
into
fits
of
laughter
jenny
shake
her
toe
at
me
jenny
gone
away
jenny
shake
her
toe
at
me
jenny
gone
away
hurrah
miss
susy
oh
jenny
gone
away
hurrah
miss
susy
oh
jenny
gone
away
what
the
obnoxious
jenny
meant
by
shaking
her
toe
whether
defiance
or
mere
departure
i
never
could
ascertain
but
her
going
away
was
an
unmistakable
subject
of
satisfaction
and
the
pause
made
on
the
last
before
the
final
announcement
of
her
departure
had
really
a
good
deal
of
dramatic
and
musical
effect
except
the
extemporaneous
chaunts
in
our
honour
of
which
i
have
written
to
you
before
i
have
never
heard
the
negroes
on
plantation
sing
any
words
that
could
be
said
to
have
any
sense
to
one
an
extremely
pretty
plaintive
and
original
air
there
was
but
one
line
which
was
repeated
with
a
sort
of
wailing
chorus
oh
my
massa
told
me
there
no
grass
in
georgia
upon
enquiring
the
meaning
of
which
i
was
told
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
lamentation
of
a
slave
from
one
of
the
more
northerly
states
virginia
or
carolina
where
the
labour
of
hoeing
the
weeds
or
grass
as
they
call
it
is
not
nearly
so
severe
as
here
in
the
rice
and
cotton
lands
of
georgia
another
very
pretty
and
pathetic
tune
began
with
words
that
seemed
to
promise
something
sentimental
fare
you
well
and
oh
oh
i
goin
away
to
leave
you
oh
oh
but
immediately
went
off
into
nonsense
verses
about
gentlemen
in
the
parlour
drinking
wine
and
cordial
and
ladies
in
the
drinking
tea
and
coffee
i
have
heard
that
many
of
the
masters
and
overseers
on
these
plantations
prohibit
melancholy
tunes
or
words
and
encourage
nothing
but
cheerful
music
and
senseless
words
deprecating
the
effect
of
sadder
strains
upon
the
slaves
whose
peculiar
musical
sensibility
might
be
expected
to
make
them
especially
excitable
by
any
songs
of
a
plaintive
character
and
having
any
reference
to
their
particular
hardships
if
it
is
true
i
think
it
a
judicious
precaution
enough
these
poor
slaves
are
just
the
sort
of
people
over
whom
a
popular
musical
appeal
to
their
feelings
and
passions
would
have
an
immense
power
in
the
evening
departure
left
me
to
the
pleasures
of
an
uninterrupted
with
his
crosseyed
overseer
and
i
endeavoured
as
i
generally
do
to
atone
by
my
conversibleness
and
civility
for
the
additional
trouble
which
no
doubt
all
my
outlandish
ways
and
notions
are
causing
the
worthy
man
so
suggestive
to
use
the
jargon
about
books
a
woman
as
myself
is
i
suspect
an
intolerable
nuisance
in
these
parts
and
poor
o
can
not
very
well
desire
to
send
me
away
however
much
he
may
wish
that
he
would
so
that
figuratively
as
well
as
literally
i
fear
the
worthy
master
voit
mauvais
as
the
french
say
i
asked
him
several
questions
about
some
of
the
slaves
who
had
managed
to
learn
to
read
and
by
what
means
they
had
been
able
to
do
so
as
teaching
them
is
strictly
prohibited
by
the
laws
they
who
instructed
them
and
such
of
them
as
acquired
the
knowledge
must
have
been
not
a
little
determined
and
persevering
this
was
my
view
of
the
case
of
course
and
of
course
it
was
not
the
overseer
i
asked
him
if
many
of
slaves
could
read
he
said
very
few
he
was
happy
to
say
but
those
few
were
just
so
many
too
many
had
he
observed
any
insubordination
in
those
who
did
and
i
reminded
him
of
cooper
london
the
methodist
preacher
whose
performance
of
the
burial
service
had
struck
me
so
much
some
time
ago
to
whose
exemplary
conduct
and
character
there
is
but
one
concurrent
testimony
all
over
the
plantation
no
he
had
no
special
complaint
to
bring
against
the
lettered
members
of
his
subject
community
but
he
spoke
by
anticipation
every
step
they
take
towards
intelligence
and
enlightenment
lessens
the
probability
of
their
acquiescing
in
their
condition
their
condition
is
not
to
be
changed
ergo
they
had
better
not
learn
to
read
a
very
succinct
and
satisfactory
argument
as
far
as
it
goes
no
doubt
and
one
to
which
i
had
not
a
word
to
reply
at
any
rate
to
o
as
i
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
discuss
the
abstract
justice
or
equity
of
the
matter
with
him
indeed
he
to
a
certain
degree
gave
up
that
part
of
the
position
starting
with
do
say
whether
it
right
or
wrong
and
in
all
conversations
that
i
have
had
with
the
southerners
upon
these
subjects
whether
out
of
civility
to
what
may
be
supposed
to
be
an
englishwoman
prejudices
or
a
forlorn
respect
to
their
own
convictions
the
question
of
the
fundamental
wrong
of
slavery
is
generally
admitted
or
at
any
rate
certainly
never
denied
that
part
of
the
subject
is
summarily
dismissed
and
all
its
other
aspects
vindicated
excused
and
even
lauded
with
untiring
eloquence
of
course
of
the
abstract
question
i
could
judge
before
i
came
here
but
i
confess
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
how
absolutely
my
observation
of
every
detail
of
the
system
as
a
practical
iniquity
would
go
to
confirm
my
opinion
of
its
abomination
o
went
on
to
condemn
and
utterly
denounce
all
the
preaching
and
teaching
and
moral
instruction
upon
religious
subjects
which
people
in
the
south
pressed
upon
by
northern
opinion
are
endeavouring
to
give
their
slaves
the
kinder
and
the
more
cowardly
masters
are
anxious
to
evade
the
charge
of
keeping
their
negroes
in
brutish
ignorance
and
so
they
crumble
what
they
suppose
and
hope
may
prove
a
little
harmless
religious
enlightenment
which
mixed
up
with
much
religious
authority
on
the
subject
of
submission
and
fidelity
to
masters
they
trust
their
slaves
may
swallow
without
its
doing
them
any
harm
that
they
may
be
better
christians
and
better
slaves
and
so
indeed
no
doubt
they
are
but
it
is
a
very
dangerous
experiment
and
from
o
point
of
view
i
quite
agree
with
him
the
letting
out
of
water
or
the
letting
in
of
light
in
infinitesimal
quantities
is
not
always
easy
the
of
the
earth
are
the
leaks
through
which
wickedness
is
eventually
swamped
compromises
forerun
absolute
surrender
in
most
matters
and
fools
and
cowards
are
in
such
cases
the
instruments
of
providence
for
their
own
defeat
o
stated
unequivocally
his
opinion
that
free
labour
would
be
more
profitable
on
the
plantations
than
the
work
of
slaves
which
being
compulsory
was
of
the
worst
possible
quality
and
the
smallest
possible
quantity
then
the
charge
of
them
before
and
after
they
are
able
to
work
is
onerous
the
cost
of
feeding
and
clothing
them
very
considerable
and
upon
the
whole
he
a
southern
overseer
pronounced
himself
decidedly
in
favour
of
free
labour
upon
grounds
of
expediency
having
at
the
beginning
of
our
conversation
declined
discussing
the
moral
aspect
of
slavery
evidently
not
thinking
that
position
tenable
i
thought
i
had
every
right
to
consider
a
decided
abolitionist
i
had
been
anxious
to
enlist
his
sympathies
on
behalf
of
my
extreme
desire
to
have
some
sort
of
garden
but
did
not
succeed
in
inspiring
him
with
my
enthusiasm
on
the
subject
he
said
there
was
but
one
garden
that
he
knew
of
in
the
whole
neighbourhood
of
darien
and
that
was
our
neighbour
old
c
a
scotchman
on
simon
i
remembered
the
splendid
gardinias
on
tunno
island
and
referred
to
them
as
a
proof
of
the
material
for
ornamental
gardening
he
laughed
and
said
rice
and
cotton
crops
were
the
ornamental
gardening
principally
admired
by
the
planters
and
that
to
the
best
of
his
belief
there
was
not
another
decent
kitchen
or
flower
garden
in
the
state
but
the
one
he
had
mentioned
the
next
day
after
this
conversation
i
walked
with
my
horticultural
zeal
much
damped
and
wandered
along
the
dyke
by
the
broad
river
looking
at
some
pretty
peach
trees
in
blossom
and
thinking
what
a
curse
of
utter
stagnation
this
slavery
produces
and
how
intolerable
to
me
a
life
passed
within
its
stifling
influence
would
be
think
of
peach
trees
in
blossom
in
the
middle
of
february
it
does
seem
cruel
with
such
a
sun
and
soil
to
be
told
that
a
garden
is
worth
nobody
while
here
however
o
said
that
he
believed
the
wife
of
the
former
overseer
had
made
a
of
a
garden
at
simon
we
shall
see
it
turns
out
to
be
while
i
was
standing
on
the
dyke
ruminating
above
the
river
i
saw
a
beautiful
white
bird
of
the
crane
species
alight
not
far
from
me
i
do
not
think
a
little
knowledge
of
natural
history
would
diminish
the
surprise
and
admiration
with
which
i
regard
the
to
me
unwonted
specimens
of
animal
existence
that
i
encounter
every
day
and
of
which
i
do
not
even
know
the
names
ignorance
is
an
odious
thing
the
birds
here
are
especially
beautiful
i
think
i
saw
one
the
other
day
of
what
species
of
course
i
do
not
know
of
a
warm
and
rich
brown
with
a
scarlet
hood
and
crest
a
lovely
creature
about
the
size
of
your
northern
robin
but
more
elegantly
shaped
this
morning
instead
of
my
usual
visit
to
the
infirmary
i
went
to
look
at
the
work
and
workers
in
the
threshing
mill
all
was
going
on
actively
and
orderly
under
the
superintendence
of
frank
with
whom
and
a
very
sagacious
clever
fellow
who
manages
the
steam
power
of
the
mill
and
is
honourably
distinguished
as
engineer
ned
i
had
a
small
chat
there
is
one
among
various
drawbacks
to
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
our
intercourse
with
these
coloured
and
brethren
at
least
in
their
slave
condition
which
certainly
exercises
my
fortitude
not
a
little
the
swarms
of
fleas
that
cohabit
with
these
sable
dependants
of
ours
are
well
incredible
moreover
they
are
by
no
means
the
only
or
most
objectionable
companions
one
borrows
from
them
and
i
never
go
to
the
infirmary
where
i
not
unfrequently
am
requested
to
look
at
very
dirty
limbs
and
bodies
in
very
dirty
draperies
without
coming
away
with
a
strong
inclination
to
throw
myself
into
the
water
and
my
clothes
into
the
fire
which
last
would
be
expensive
i
do
not
suppose
that
these
hateful
consequences
of
dirt
and
disorder
are
worse
here
than
among
the
poor
and
neglected
human
creatures
who
swarm
in
the
lower
parts
of
european
cities
but
my
call
to
visit
them
has
never
been
such
as
that
which
constrains
me
to
go
daily
among
these
poor
people
and
although
on
one
or
two
occasions
i
have
penetrated
into
fearfully
foul
and
filthy
abodes
of
misery
in
london
i
have
never
rendered
the
same
personal
services
to
their
inhabitants
that
i
do
to
slaves
and
so
have
not
incurred
the
same
amount
of
entomological
inconvenience
after
leaving
the
mill
i
prolonged
my
walk
and
came
for
the
first
time
upon
one
of
the
as
they
are
called
in
full
field
work
upon
my
appearance
and
approach
there
was
a
momentary
suspension
of
labour
and
the
usual
chorus
of
screams
and
ejaculations
of
welcome
affection
and
infinite
desires
for
infinite
small
indulgences
i
was
afraid
to
stop
their
work
not
feeling
at
all
sure
that
urging
a
conversation
with
me
would
be
accepted
as
any
excuse
for
an
uncompleted
task
or
avert
the
fatal
infliction
of
the
usual
award
of
stripes
so
i
hurried
off
and
left
them
to
their
hoeing
on
my
way
home
i
was
encountered
by
london
our
methodist
preacher
who
accosted
me
with
a
request
for
a
and
bible
and
expressed
his
regret
at
hearing
that
we
were
so
soon
going
to
simon
i
promised
him
his
holy
books
and
asked
him
how
he
had
learned
to
read
but
found
it
impossible
to
get
him
to
tell
me
i
wonder
if
he
thought
he
should
be
putting
his
teacher
whoever
he
was
in
danger
of
the
penalty
of
the
law
against
instructing
the
slaves
if
he
told
me
who
he
was
it
was
impossible
to
make
him
do
so
so
that
besides
his
other
good
qualities
he
appears
to
have
that
most
unusual
one
of
all
in
an
uneducated
person
discretion
he
certainly
is
a
most
remarkable
man
after
parting
with
him
i
was
assailed
by
a
small
gang
of
children
clamouring
for
the
indulgence
of
some
meat
which
they
besought
me
to
give
them
animal
food
is
only
allowed
to
certain
of
the
harder
working
men
hedgers
and
ditchers
and
to
them
only
occasionally
and
in
very
moderate
rations
my
small
cannibals
clamoured
round
me
for
flesh
as
if
i
had
had
a
butcher
cart
in
my
pocket
till
i
began
to
laugh
and
then
to
run
and
away
they
came
like
a
pack
of
little
black
wolves
at
my
heels
shrieking
you
gib
me
piece
meat
missis
you
gib
me
meat
till
i
got
home
at
the
door
i
found
another
petitioner
a
young
woman
named
maria
who
brought
a
fine
child
in
her
arms
and
demanded
a
present
of
a
piece
of
flannel
upon
my
asking
her
who
her
husband
was
she
replied
without
much
hesitation
that
she
did
not
possess
any
such
appendage
i
gave
another
look
at
her
bonny
baby
and
went
into
the
house
to
get
the
flannel
for
her
i
afterwards
heard
from
that
she
and
two
other
girls
of
her
age
about
seventeen
were
the
only
instances
on
the
island
of
women
with
illegitimate
children
after
i
had
been
in
the
house
a
little
while
i
was
summoned
out
again
to
receive
the
petition
of
certain
poor
women
in
the
to
have
their
work
lightened
i
was
of
course
obliged
to
tell
them
that
i
could
not
interfere
in
the
matter
that
their
master
was
away
and
that
when
he
came
back
they
must
present
their
request
to
him
they
said
they
had
already
begged
and
he
had
refused
and
they
thought
perhaps
if
begged
for
them
he
would
lighten
their
task
poor
poor
poor
woman
that
i
am
to
have
such
prayers
addressed
to
me
i
had
to
tell
them
that
if
they
had
already
spoken
to
their
master
i
was
afraid
my
doing
so
would
be
of
no
use
but
that
when
he
came
back
i
would
try
so
choking
with
crying
i
turned
away
from
them
and
the
house
to
the
chorus
of
thank
you
missis
god
bless
you
missis
e
i
think
an
improvement
might
be
made
upon
that
caricature
published
a
short
time
ago
called
the
of
the
south
i
think
an
elegant
young
carolinian
or
georgian
gentleman
whip
in
hand
driving
a
gang
of
women
as
they
are
called
here
would
be
a
pretty
version
of
the
of
the
south
a
little
coarse
i
am
afraid
you
will
say
oh
quite
horribly
coarse
but
then
so
true
a
great
matter
in
works
of
art
which
appear
to
be
thought
excellent
only
in
proportion
to
their
lack
of
ideal
elevation
that
would
be
a
subject
and
a
treatment
of
it
which
could
not
be
accused
of
imaginative
exaggeration
at
any
rate
in
the
evening
i
mentioned
the
petitions
of
these
poor
women
to
o
thinking
that
perhaps
he
had
the
power
to
lessen
their
tasks
he
seemed
evidently
annoyed
at
their
having
appealed
to
me
said
that
their
work
was
not
a
bit
too
much
for
them
and
that
constantly
they
were
themselves
in
the
in
order
to
obtain
a
diminution
of
their
labour
poor
creatures
i
suppose
some
of
them
do
but
again
it
must
be
a
hard
matter
for
those
who
do
not
not
to
obtain
the
mitigation
of
their
toil
which
their
condition
requires
for
their
assertion
and
their
evidence
are
never
received
they
ca
be
believed
even
if
they
were
upon
oath
say
their
white
taskmasters
why
because
they
have
never
been
taught
the
obligations
of
an
oath
to
whom
made
or
wherefore
binding
and
they
are
punished
both
directly
and
indirectly
for
their
moral
ignorance
as
if
it
were
a
natural
and
incorrigible
element
of
their
character
instead
of
the
inevitable
result
of
their
miserable
position
the
oath
of
any
and
every
scoundrelly
fellow
with
a
white
skin
is
received
but
not
that
of
such
a
man
as
frank
ned
old
jacob
or
cooper
london
dearest
e
i
think
it
right
to
begin
this
letter
with
an
account
of
a
most
prosperous
fishing
expedition
jack
and
i
achieved
the
other
morning
it
is
true
we
still
occasionally
drew
up
huge
with
their
detestable
beards
and
spikes
but
we
also
captivated
some
magnificent
perch
and
the
altamaha
perch
are
worth
one
while
both
to
catch
and
to
eat
on
a
visit
i
had
to
make
on
the
mainland
the
same
day
i
saw
a
tiny
strip
of
garden
ground
rescued
from
the
sandy
road
called
the
street
perfectly
filled
with
hyacinths
double
jonquils
and
snowdrops
a
charming
nosegay
for
february
after
leaving
the
boat
on
my
return
home
i
encountered
a
curious
creature
walking
all
sideways
a
small
cross
between
a
lobster
and
a
crab
one
of
the
negroes
to
whom
i
applied
for
its
denomination
informed
me
that
it
was
a
land
crab
with
which
general
description
of
this
very
peculiar
multipede
you
must
be
satisfied
for
i
can
tell
you
no
more
i
went
a
little
further
as
the
nursery
rhyme
says
and
met
with
a
snake
and
not
being
able
to
determine
at
ignorant
first
sight
whether
it
was
a
malignant
serpent
or
not
i
ingloriously
took
to
my
heels
and
came
home
on
the
full
run
it
is
the
first
of
these
exceedingly
displeasing
animals
i
have
encountered
here
but
jack
for
my
consolation
tells
me
that
they
abound
on
simon
whither
we
are
going
and
all
kinds
says
he
with
an
affluence
of
promise
in
his
tone
that
is
quite
agreeable
rattlesnakes
will
be
quite
enough
of
a
treat
without
the
vague
horrors
that
may
be
comprised
in
the
additional
kinds
jack
account
of
the
game
on
simon
is
really
quite
tantalising
to
me
who
can
not
carry
a
gun
any
more
than
if
i
were
a
slave
he
says
that
partridges
woodcocks
snipe
and
wild
duck
abound
so
that
at
any
rate
our
table
ought
to
be
well
supplied
his
account
of
the
bears
that
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
woods
of
the
mainland
is
not
so
pleasant
though
he
says
they
do
no
harm
to
the
people
if
they
are
not
meddled
with
but
that
they
steal
the
corn
from
the
fields
when
it
is
ripe
and
actually
swim
the
river
to
commit
their
depredations
on
the
islands
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
this
looking
at
this
wide
and
heavy
stream
though
to
be
sure
i
did
once
see
a
young
horse
swim
across
the
lawrence
between
montreal
and
quebec
a
feat
of
natation
which
much
enlarged
my
belief
in
what
quadrupeds
may
accomplish
when
they
have
no
choice
between
swimming
and
sinking
you
can
not
imagine
how
great
a
triumph
the
virtue
next
to
godliness
is
making
under
my
auspices
and
a
judicious
system
of
small
bribery
i
can
hardly
stir
now
without
being
assailed
with
cries
of
missis
me
mind
chile
me
bery
clean
or
the
additional
gratifying
fact
chile
too
him
bery
clean
this
virtue
however
if
painful
to
the
practisers
as
no
doubt
it
is
is
expensive
too
to
me
and
i
shall
have
to
try
some
moral
influence
equivalent
in
value
to
a
cent
current
coin
of
the
realm
what
a
poor
chance
indeed
the
poor
abstract
idea
runs
however
it
is
really
a
comfort
to
see
the
poor
little
woolly
heads
now
in
most
instances
stripped
of
their
additional
filthy
artificial
envelopes
in
my
afternoon
row
i
passed
a
huge
dead
alligator
lying
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
muddy
slime
of
the
river
bank
a
most
hideous
object
it
was
and
i
was
glad
to
turn
my
eyes
to
the
beautiful
surface
of
the
mid
stream
all
burnished
with
sunset
glories
and
broken
with
the
vivacious
gambols
of
a
school
of
porpoises
it
is
curious
i
think
that
these
creatures
should
come
fifteen
miles
from
the
sea
to
enliven
the
waters
round
our
little
rice
swamp
while
rowing
this
evening
i
was
led
by
my
conversation
with
jack
to
some
of
those
reflections
with
which
my
mind
is
naturally
incessantly
filled
here
but
which
i
am
obliged
to
be
very
careful
not
to
give
any
utterance
to
the
testimony
of
no
negro
is
received
in
a
southern
court
of
law
and
the
reason
commonly
adduced
for
this
is
that
the
state
of
ignorance
in
which
the
negroes
are
necessarily
kept
renders
them
incapable
of
comprehending
the
obligations
of
an
oath
and
yet
with
an
inconsistency
which
might
be
said
to
border
on
effrontery
these
same
people
are
admitted
to
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
church
and
are
certainly
thereby
supposed
to
be
capable
of
assuming
the
highest
christian
obligations
and
the
entire
fulfilment
of
god
commandments
including
of
course
the
duty
of
speaking
the
truth
at
all
times
as
we
were
proceeding
down
the
river
we
met
the
flat
as
it
is
called
a
huge
sort
of
clumsy
boat
more
like
a
raft
than
any
other
species
of
craft
coming
up
from
simon
with
its
usual
swarthy
freight
of
dependants
from
that
place
i
made
jack
turn
our
canoe
because
the
universal
outcries
and
exclamations
very
distinctly
intimated
that
i
should
be
expected
to
be
at
home
to
receive
the
homage
of
this
cargo
of
people
no
sooner
indeed
had
i
disembarked
and
reached
the
house
than
a
dark
cloud
of
black
life
filled
the
piazza
and
swarmed
up
the
steps
and
i
had
to
shake
hands
like
a
popular
president
till
my
arm
ached
at
the
when
this
tribe
had
dispersed
itself
a
very
old
woman
with
a
remarkably
intelligent
young
girl
came
forward
and
claimed
my
attention
the
old
woman
who
must
i
think
by
her
appearance
have
been
near
seventy
had
been
one
of
the
house
servants
on
simon
island
in
major
time
and
retained
a
certain
dignified
courtesy
and
respectfulness
of
manner
which
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
attribute
of
the
better
class
of
slaves
whose
intercourse
with
their
masters
while
tending
to
expand
their
intelligence
cultivates
at
the
same
time
the
natural
turn
for
good
manners
which
is
i
think
a
distinctive
peculiarity
of
negroes
if
not
in
the
kingdom
of
dahomey
certainly
in
the
united
states
of
america
if
it
can
be
for
a
moment
attributed
to
the
beneficent
influence
of
slavery
on
their
natures
and
i
think
slaveowners
are
quite
likely
to
imagine
so
it
is
curious
enough
that
there
is
hardly
any
alloy
whatever
of
cringing
servility
or
even
humility
in
the
good
manners
of
the
blacks
but
a
rather
courtly
and
affable
condescension
which
combined
with
their
affection
for
and
misapplication
of
long
words
produces
an
exceedingly
comical
effect
molly
after
congratulating
herself
with
many
thanks
to
heaven
for
having
spared
her
to
see
wife
and
children
drew
forward
her
young
companion
and
informed
me
she
was
one
of
her
numerous
grandchildren
the
damsel
ycleped
louisa
made
rather
a
obeisance
and
her
old
grandmother
went
on
to
inform
me
that
she
had
only
lately
been
forgiven
by
the
overseer
for
an
attempt
to
run
away
from
the
plantation
i
enquired
the
cause
of
her
desire
to
do
so
a
she
had
got
for
an
unfinished
task
lor
missis
explained
the
old
woman
no
use
what
use

and
if
the
good
account
of
their

in
doing
so
is
correct
which
substituting
biting
for
eating
on
the
part
of
the
snakes
it
undoubtedly
is
one
does
not
see
exactly
what
particular
merit
the
institution
of
slavery
as
practised
on
plantation
derives
from
the
fact
that
his
do
neber
run
away
after
dismissing
molly
and
her
i
was
about
to
the
house
when
i
was
stopped
by
betty
frank
wife
who
came
with
a
petition
that
she
might
be
baptised
as
usual
with
all
requests
involving
anything
more
than
an
immediate
physical
indulgence
i
promised
to
refer
the
matter
to
but
expressed
some
surprise
that
betty
now
by
no
means
a
young
woman
should
have
postponed
a
ceremony
which
the
religious
among
the
slaves
are
apt
to
attach
much
importance
to
she
told
me
she
had
more
than
once
applied
for
this
permission
to
massa
k
the
former
overseer
but
had
never
been
able
to
obtain
it
but
that
now
she
thought
she
would
ask
missis
footnote
of
this
woman
life
on
the
plantation
i
subsequently
learned
the
following
circumstances
she
was
the
wife
of
frank
the
most
intelligent
and
trustworthy
of
slaves
the
head
driver
second
in
command
to
the
overseer
and
indeed
second
to
none
during
the
pestilential
season
when
the
rice
swamps
can
not
with
impunity
be
inhabited
by
any
white
man
and
when
therefore
the
whole
force
employed
in
its
cultivation
on
the
island
remains
entirely
under
his
authority
and
control
his
wife
a
tidy
trim
intelligent
woman
with
a
pretty
figure
but
a
decidedly
negro
face
was
taken
from
him
by
the
overseer
left
in
charge
of
the
plantation
by
the
the
and
k
and
she
had
a
son
by
him
whose
straight
features
and
diluted
colour
no
less
than
his
troublesome
discontented
and
insubmissive
disposition
bear
witness
to
his
yankee
descent
i
do
not
know
how
long
k
occupation
of
frank
wife
continued
or
how
the
latter
endured
the
wrong
done
to
him
when
i
visited
the
island
betty
was
again
living
with
her
husband
a
grave
sad
man
whose
admirable
moral
and
mental
qualities
were
extolled
to
me
by
no
worse
a
judge
of
such
matters
than
k
himself
during
the
few
days
he
spent
with
while
we
were
on
the
plantation
this
outrage
upon
this
man
rights
was
perfectly
notorious
among
all
the
slaves
and
his
hopeful
offspring
renty
alluding
very
unmistakably
to
his
superior
birth
on
one
occasion
when
he
applied
for
permission
to
have
a
gun
observed
that
though
the
people
in
general
on
the
plantation
were
not
allowed
firearms
he
thought
he
might
account
of
his
and
added
that
he
thought
k
might
have
left
him
his
this
precious
sample
of
the
mode
in
which
the
vices
of
the
whites
procure
the
intellectual
progress
of
the
blacks
to
their
own
endangerment
was
as
you
will
easily
believe
a
significant
chapter
to
me
in
the
black
history
of
oppression
which
is
laid
before
my
eyes
in
this
place
yesterday
afternoon
i
received
a
visit
from
the
wife
of
our
neighbour
t
as
usual
she
exclaimed
at
my
good
fortune
in
having
a
white
woman
with
my
children
when
she
saw
m
and
as
usual
went
on
to
expatiate
on
the
utter
impossibility
of
finding
a
trustworthy
nurse
anywhere
in
the
south
to
whom
your
children
could
be
safely
confided
for
a
day
or
even
an
hour
as
usual
too
the
causes
of
this
unworthiness
or
incapacity
for
a
confidential
servant
occupation
were
ignored
and
the
fact
laid
to
the
natural
defects
of
the
negro
race
i
am
sick
and
weary
of
this
cruel
and
ignorant
folly
this
afternoon
i
went
out
to
refresh
myself
with
a
row
on
the
broad
altamaha
and
the
conversation
of
my
slave
jack
which
is
i
assure
you
by
no
means
devoid
of
interest
of
various
kinds
pathetic
and
humorous
i
do
not
know
that
jack
scientific
information
is
the
most
valuable
in
the
world
and
i
sometimes
marvel
with
perhaps
unjust
incredulity
at
the
facts
in
natural
history
which
he
imparts
to
me
for
instance
he
told
me
as
we
rowed
past
certain
mud
islands
very
like
children
mud
puddings
on
a
rather
larger
scale
than
usual
that
they
were
inaccessible
and
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
land
on
one
of
them
even
for
the
shortest
time
not
understanding
why
people
who
did
not
mind
being
up
to
their
knees
in
mud
should
not
land
there
if
they
pleased
i
demurred
to
his
assertion
when
he
followed
it
up
by
assuring
me
that
there
were
what
he
called
under
the
mud
and
that
whatever
was
placed
on
the
surface
would
not
only
sink
through
the
mud
but
also
into
a
mysterious
quicksand
of
unknown
depth
and
extent
below
it
this
may
be
true
but
sounds
very
strange
although
i
remember
that
the
frequent
occurrence
of
large
patches
of
quicksand
was
found
to
be
one
of
the
principal
impediments
in
the
way
of
the
canal
speculators
at
brunswick
i
did
not
however
hear
that
these
sinks
as
jack
called
them
were
found
below
a
thick
stratum
of
heavy
mud
in
remonstrating
with
him
upon
the
want
of
decent
cleanliness
generally
among
the
people
and
citing
to
him
one
among
the
many
evils
resulting
from
it
the
intolerable
quantity
of
fleas
in
all
the
houses
he
met
me
full
with
another
fact
in
natural
history
which
if
it
be
fact
and
not
fiction
certainly
gave
him
the
best
of
the
argument
he
declared
with
the
utmost
vehemence
that
the
sand
of
the
pine
woods
on
the
mainland
across
the
river
literally
swarmed
with
fleas
that
in
the
uninhabited
places
the
sand
itself
was
full
of
them
and
that
so
far
from
being
a
result
of
human
habitation
they
were
found
in
less
numbers
round
the
negro
huts
on
the
mainland
than
in
the
lonely
woods
around
them
the
ploughing
is
at
length
fairly
inaugurated
and
there
is
a
regular
jubilee
among
the
negroes
thereat
after
discoursing
fluently
on
the
improvements
likely
to
result
from
the
measure
jack
wound
up
by
saying
he
had
been
afraid
it
would
not
be
tried
on
account
of
the
greater
scarcity
and
consequently
greater
value
of
horses
over
men
in
these
parts
a
modest
and
conclusion
dearest
e
i
walked
up
to
see
that
land
of
promise
the
ploughed
field
it
did
not
look
to
me
anything
like
as
heavy
soil
as
the
cold
wet
sour
stiff
clay
i
have
seen
turned
up
in
some
of
the
swampy
fields
round
lenox
and
as
for
the
cypress
roots
which
were
urged
as
so
serious
an
impediment
they
are
not
much
more
frequent
and
certainly
not
as
resisting
as
the
granite
knees
and
elbows
that
stick
out
through
the
scanty
covering
of
the
said
clay
which
mother
earth
allows
herself
as
sole
garment
for
her
old
bones
in
many
a
berkshire
patch
of
corn
after
my
survey
as
i
walked
home
i
came
upon
a
gang
of
lusty
women
as
the
phrase
is
here
for
women
in
the
they
were
engaged
in
burning
stubble
and
i
was
nearly
choked
while
receiving
the
multitudinous
complaints
and
compliments
with
which
they
overwhelmed
me
after
leaving
them
i
wandered
along
the
river
side
on
the
dyke
homeward
rejoicing
in
the
buds
and
green
things
putting
forth
their
tender
shoots
on
every
spray
in
the
early
bees
and
even
the
less
amiable
wasps
busy
in
the
sunshine
with
flowers
weeds
i
suppose
they
should
be
called
already
opening
their
sweet
temptations
to
them
and
giving
the
earth
a
spring
aspect
such
as
it
does
not
wear
with
you
in
massachusetts
till
late
in
may
in
the
afternoon
i
took
my
accustomed
row
there
had
been
a
tremendous
ebb
tide
the
consequence
of
which
was
to
lay
bare
portions
of
the
banks
which
i
had
not
seen
before
the
cypress
roots
form
a
most
extraordinary
mass
of
intertwined
so
closely
matted
and
joined
together
that
the
separate
roots
in
spite
of
their
individual
peculiarities
appeared
only
like
divisions
of
a
continuous
body
they
presented
the
appearance
in
several
places
of
jagged
pieces
of
splintered
rock
with
their
huge
teeth
pointing
downward
into
the
water
their
decay
is
so
slow
that
the
protection
they
afford
the
soft
spongy
banks
against
the
action
of
the
water
is
likely
to
be
prolonged
until
the
gathering
and
deposit
of
successive
layers
of
alluvium
will
remove
them
from
the
margin
of
which
they
are
now
most
useful
supports
on
my
return
home
i
was
met
by
a
child
as
she
seemed
to
me
carrying
a
baby
in
whose
behalf
she
begged
me
for
some
clothes
on
making
some
enquiry
i
was
amazed
to
find
that
the
child
was
her
own
she
said
she
was
married
and
fourteen
years
old
she
looked
much
younger
even
than
that
poor
creature
her
mother
who
came
up
while
i
was
talking
to
her
said
she
did
not
herself
know
the
girl
age
how
horridly
brutish
it
all
did
seem
to
be
sure
the
spring
is
already
here
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
i
do
not
know
who
planted
some
straggling
pyrus
japonica
near
the
house
but
it
is
blessing
my
eyes
with
a
hundred
little
buds
which
will
presently
burst
into
a
blaze
there
are
clumps
of
narcissus
roots
sending
up
sheaves
of
ivory
blossoms
and
i
actually
found
a
monthly
rose
in
bloom
on
the
sunny
side
of
one
of
the
dykes
what
a
delight
they
are
in
the
slovenly
desolation
of
this
abode
of
mine
what
a
garden
one
might
have
on
the
banks
of
these
dykes
with
the
least
amount
of
trouble
and
care
in
the
afternoon
i
rowed
over
to
darien
and
there
procuring
the
most
miserable
vehicle
calling
itself
a
carriage
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
dirtiest
and
shabbiest
london
were
a
chariot
of
splendour
and
ease
to
it
we
drove
some
distance
into
the
sandy
wilderness
that
surrounds
the
little
town
to
pay
a
visit
to
some
of
the
resident
gentry
who
had
called
upon
us
the
road
was
a
deep
wearisome
sandy
track
stretching
wearisomely
into
the
wearisome
pine
forest
a
species
of
wilderness
more
oppressive
a
thousand
times
to
the
senses
and
imagination
than
any
extent
of
monotonous
prairie
barren
steppe
or
boundless
desert
can
be
for
the
horizon
there
at
least
invites
and
detains
the
eye
suggesting
beyond
its
limit
possible
change
the
lights
and
shadows
and
enchanting
colours
of
the
sky
afford
some
variety
in
their
movement
and
change
and
the
reflections
of
their
tints
while
in
this
hideous
and
apparently
boundless
pine
barren
you
are
deprived
alike
of
horizon
before
you
and
heaven
above
you
nor
sun
nor
star
appears
through
the
thick
covert
which
in
the
shabby
dinginess
of
its
dark
expanse
looks
like
a
gigantic
cotton
umbrella
stretched
immeasurably
over
you
it
is
true
that
over
that
sandy
soil
a
dark
green
cotton
umbrella
is
a
very
welcome
protection
from
the
sun
and
when
the
wind
makes
music
in
the
tall
and
refreshment
in
the
air
beneath
them
the
comparison
may
seem
ungrateful
enough
however
there
was
neither
sound
above
nor
motion
below
and
the
heat
was
perfectly
stifling
as
we
ploughed
our
way
through
the
sand
solitudes
from
time
to
time
a
thicket
of
exquisite
evergreen
shrubs
broke
the
monotonous
lines
of
the
countless
pine
shafts
rising
round
us
and
still
more
welcome
were
the
golden
garlands
of
the
exquisite
wild
jasmine
hanging
drooping
trailing
clinging
climbing
through
the
dreary
forest
joining
to
the
warm
aromatic
smell
of
the
fir
trees
a
delicious
fragrance
as
of
acres
of
heliotrope
in
bloom
i
wonder
if
this
delightful
creature
is
very
difficult
of
cultivation
out
of
its
natural
region
i
never
remember
to
have
seen
it
at
least
not
in
blossom
in
any
collection
of
plants
in
the
northern
states
or
in
europe
where
it
certainly
deserves
an
honourable
place
for
its
grace
beauty
and
fragrance
on
our
drive
we
passed
occasionally
a
tattered
man
or
woman
whose
yellow
mud
complexion
straight
features
and
singularly
sinister
countenance
bespoke
an
entirely
different
race
from
the
negro
population
in
the
midst
of
which
they
lived
these
are
the
of
georgia
i
suppose
the
most
degraded
race
of
human
beings
claiming
an
origin
that
can
be
found
on
the
face
of
the
earth
filthy
lazy
ignorant
brutal
proud
penniless
savages
without
one
of
the
nobler
attributes
which
have
been
found
occasionally
allied
to
the
vices
of
savage
nature
they
own
no
slaves
for
they
are
almost
without
exception
abjectly
poor
they
will
not
work
for
that
as
they
conceive
would
reduce
them
to
an
equality
with
the
abhorred
negroes
they
squat
and
steal
and
starve
on
the
outskirts
of
this
lowest
of
all
civilised
societies
and
their
countenances
bear
witness
to
the
squalor
of
their
condition
and
the
utter
degradation
of
their
natures
to
the
crime
of
slavery
though
they
have
no
profitable
part
or
lot
in
it
they
are
fiercely
accessory
because
it
is
the
barrier
that
divides
the
black
and
white
races
at
the
foot
of
which
they
lie
wallowing
in
unspeakable
degradation
but
immensely
proud
of
the
base
freedom
which
still
separates
them
from
the
tillers
of
the
soil
footnote
of
such
is
the
white
family
so
wonderfully
described
in
stowe
whose
only
slave
brings
up
the
orphaned
children
of
his
masters
with
such
exquisitely
grotesque
and
pathetic
tenderness
from
such
the
conscription
which
has
fed
the
southern
army
in
the
deplorable
civil
conflict
now
raging
in
america
has
drawn
its
rank
and
file
better
for
powder
the
world
could
scarcely
supply
fierce
and
idle
with
hardly
one
of
the
necessities
or
amenities
that
belong
to
civilised
existence
they
are
hardy
endurers
of
hardship
and
reckless
to
a
savage
degree
of
the
value
of
life
whether
their
own
or
others
the
soldier
pay
received
or
promised
exceeds
in
amount
per
month
anything
they
ever
earned
before
per
year
and
the
war
they
wage
is
one
that
enlists
all
their
proud
and
ferocious
instincts
it
is
against
the
yankees
the
northern
sons
of
free
soil
free
toil
and
intelligence
the
hated
abolitionists
whose
success
would
sweep
away
slavery
and
reduce
the
southern
white
men
to
work
no
wonder
they
are
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
against
this
detestable
alternative
especially
as
they
look
to
victory
as
the
certain
promotion
of
the
refuse
of
the
white
population
of
the
south
of
which
they
are
one
and
all
members
to
the
coveted
dignity
of
slaveholders
the
house
at
which
our
call
was
paid
was
set
down
in
the
midst
of
the
pine
barren
with
roads
and
paths
round
it
suggesting
that
it
might
be
visited
and
was
inhabited
it
was
large
and
not
unhandsome
though
curiously
dilapidated
considering
that
people
were
actually
living
in
it
certain
remnants
of
carving
on
the
cornices
and
paint
on
the
panels
bore
witness
to
some
former
stage
of
existence
less
neglected
and
deteriorated
than
the
present
the
old
lady
mistress
of
this
most
forlorn
abode
amiably
enquired
if
so
much
exercise
did
not
fatigue
me
at
first
i
thought
she
imagined
i
must
have
walked
through
the
pine
forest
all
the
way
from
darien
but
she
explained
that
she
considered
the
drive
quite
an
effort
and
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
to
hear
people
in
america
talk
of
being
dragged
over
bad
roads
in
uneasy
carriages
as
exercise
showing
how
very
little
they
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
how
completely
they
identify
it
with
the
idea
of
mere
painful
fatigue
instead
of
pleasurable
exertion
returning
home
my
reflections
ran
much
on
the
possible
future
destiny
of
these
vast
tracts
of
sandy
soil
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ground
capable
of
supporting
the
evergreen
growth
the
luxuriant
gardenia
bushes
the
bay
myrtle
the
beautiful
magnolia
grandiflora
and
the
powerful
and
gnarled
live
oaks
that
find
their
sustenance
in
this
earth
and
under
this
same
sky
as
the
fir
trees
must
be
convertible
into
a
prosperous
habitation
for
other
valuable
vegetable
growth
that
would
add
immensely
to
the
wealth
of
the
southern
states
the
orange
thrives
and
bears
profusely
along
this
part
of
the
of
georgia
and
i
can
not
conceive
that
the
olive
the
mulberry
and
the
vine
might
not
be
acclimated
and
successfully
and
profitably
cultivated
throughout
the
whole
of
this
region
the
swampy
lower
lands
alone
remaining
as
rice
plantations
the
produce
of
these
already
exceeds
in
value
that
of
the
once
and
i
can
not
help
believing
that
silk
and
wine
and
oil
may
and
will
hereafter
become
with
the
present
solitary
cotton
crop
joint
possessors
of
all
this
now
but
wilderness
the
soil
all
round
sorrento
is
very
nearly
as
light
and
dry
and
sandy
as
this
and
vineyards
and
olive
orchards
and
cocooneries
are
part
of
the
agricultural
wealth
there
our
neighbour
c
has
successfully
cultivated
the
in
his
garden
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
at
simon
and
certainly
the
ilex
orange
and
myrtle
abounding
here
suggest
natural
affinities
between
the
italian
soil
and
climate
and
this
i
must
tell
you
something
funny
which
occurred
yesterday
at
dinner
which
will
give
you
some
idea
of
the
strange
mode
in
which
we
live
we
have
now
not
unfrequently
had
mutton
at
table
the
flavour
of
which
is
quite
excellent
as
indeed
it
well
may
be
for
it
is
raised
under
all
the
conditions
of
the
famous
that
the
french
gourmands
especially
prize
and
which
are
reproduced
on
our
side
of
the
channel
in
the
peculiar
qualities
of
our
best
south
down
the
mutton
we
have
here
grazes
on
the
short
sweet
grass
at
simon
within
influence
and
is
some
of
the
very
best
i
have
ever
tasted
but
it
is
invariably
brought
to
table
in
lumps
or
chunks
of
no
particular
shape
or
size
and
in
which
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
recognise
any
part
of
the
quadruped
creature
sheep
with
which
my
eyes
have
hitherto
become
acquainted
eat
it
one
may
and
does
thankfully
name
it
one
could
not
by
any
possibility
having
submitted
to
this
for
some
time
i
at
length
enquired
why
a
decent
usual
christian
joint
of
mutton
leg
shoulder
or
saddle
was
never
brought
to
table
the
reply
was
that
the
always
cut
up
the
meat
and
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
do
it
otherwise
than
by
dividing
it
into
so
many
thick
square
pieces
and
proceeding
to
chop
it
up
on
that
principle
and
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
or
are
all
that
a
whole
sheep
ever
furnishes
to
our
table
by
this
artistic
and
economical
process
this
morning
i
have
been
to
the
hospital
to
see
a
poor
woman
who
has
just
enriched
by
him
another
slave
the
poor
little
piccaninny
as
they
called
it
was
not
one
bit
uglier
than
white
babies
under
similarly
novel
circumstances
except
in
one
particular
that
it
had
a
head
of
hair
like
a
trunk
in
spite
of
which
i
had
all
the
pains
in
the
world
in
persuading
its
mother
not
to
put
a
cap
upon
it
i
bribed
her
finally
by
the
promise
of
a
pair
of
socks
instead
with
which
i
undertook
to
endow
her
child
and
moreover
actually
prevailed
upon
her
to
forego
the
usual
swaddling
and
swathing
process
and
let
her
poor
baby
be
dressed
at
its
first
entrance
into
life
as
i
assured
her
both
mine
had
been
on
leaving
the
hospital
i
visited
the
huts
all
along
the
street
confiscating
sundry
refractory
baby
caps
among
shrieks
and
outcries
partly
of
laughter
and
partly
of
real
ignorant
alarm
for
the
consequence
i
think
if
this
infatuation
for
hot
continues
i
shall
make
shaving
the
children
heads
the
only
condition
upon
which
they
shall
be
allowed
to
wear
caps
on
sunday
morning
i
went
over
to
darien
to
church
our
people
church
was
closed
the
minister
having
gone
to
officiate
elsewhere
with
laudable
liberality
i
walked
into
the
opposite
church
of
a
different
not
to
say
opposite
sect
here
i
heard
a
sermon
the
opening
of
which
will
probably
edify
you
as
it
did
me
that
if
a
man
was
in
all
his
he
was
apt
to
think
he
did
all
that
could
be
required
of
him
and
no
wide
mistake
either
one
might
suppose
but
is
it
not
wonderful
how
such
words
can
be
spoken
here
with
the
most
absolute
unconsciousness
of
their
tremendous
bearing
upon
the
existence
of
every
slaveholder
who
hears
them
certainly
the
use
that
is
second
nature
has
made
the
awful
injustice
in
the
daily
practice
of
which
these
people
live
a
thing
of
which
they
are
as
little
aware
as
you
or
i
of
the
atmospheric
air
that
we
inhale
each
time
we
breathe
the
bulk
of
the
congregation
in
this
church
was
white
the
negroes
are
of
course
not
allowed
to
mix
with
their
masters
in
the
house
of
god
and
there
is
no
special
place
set
apart
for
them
occasionally
one
or
two
are
to
be
seen
in
the
corners
of
the
singing
gallery
but
any
more
open
pollution
by
them
of
their
church
could
not
be
tolerated
people
have
petitioned
very
vehemently
that
he
would
build
a
church
for
them
on
the
island
i
doubt
however
his
allowing
them
such
a
luxury
as
a
place
of
worship
all
to
themselves
such
a
privilege
might
not
be
well
thought
of
by
the
neighbouring
planters
indeed
it
is
almost
what
one
might
call
a
idea
dangerous
demoralising
inflammatory
incendiary
i
should
not
wonder
if
i
should
be
suspected
of
being
the
chief
of
it
and
yet
i
am
not
it
is
an
old
hope
and
entreaty
of
these
poor
people
which
am
afraid
they
are
not
destined
to
see
fulfilled
dearest
e
passing
the
this
morning
in
my
walk
i
went
in
to
look
at
the
machinery
the
large
steam
mortars
which
shell
the
rice
and
which
work
under
the
intelligent
and
reliable
supervision
of
engineer
ned
i
was
much
surprised
in
the
course
of
conversation
with
him
this
morning
to
find
how
much
older
a
man
he
was
than
he
appeared
indeed
his
youthful
appearance
had
hitherto
puzzled
me
much
in
accounting
for
his
very
superior
intelligence
and
the
important
duties
confided
to
him
he
is
however
a
man
upwards
of
forty
years
old
although
he
looks
ten
years
younger
he
attributed
his
own
uncommonly
youthful
appearance
to
the
fact
of
his
never
having
done
what
he
called
field
work
or
been
exposed
as
the
common
gang
negroes
are
to
the
hardships
of
their
all
but
brutish
existence
he
said
his
former
master
had
brought
him
up
very
kindly
and
he
had
learnt
to
tend
the
engines
and
had
never
been
put
to
any
other
work
but
he
said
this
was
not
the
case
with
his
poor
wife
he
wished
she
was
as
well
off
as
he
was
but
she
had
to
work
in
the
and
was
broke
in
two
with
labour
and
exposure
and
hard
work
while
with
child
and
hard
work
just
directly
after
he
said
she
could
hardly
crawl
and
he
urged
me
very
much
to
speak
a
kind
word
for
her
to
massa
she
was
almost
all
the
time
in
hospital
and
he
thought
she
could
not
live
long
now
e
here
is
another
instance
of
the
horrible
injustice
of
this
system
of
slavery
in
my
country
or
in
yours
a
man
endowed
with
sufficient
knowledge
and
capacity
to
be
an
engineer
would
of
course
be
in
the
receipt
of
considerable
wages
his
wife
would
together
with
himself
reap
the
advantages
of
his
ability
and
share
the
his
labour
earned
he
would
be
able
to
procure
for
her
comfort
in
sickness
or
in
health
and
beyond
the
necessary
household
work
which
the
wives
of
most
artisans
are
inured
to
she
would
have
no
labour
to
encounter
in
case
of
sickness
even
these
would
be
alleviated
by
the
assistance
of
some
stout
girl
of
all
work
or
kindly
neighbour
and
the
tidy
parlour
or
snug
would
be
her
retreat
if
unequal
to
the
daily
duties
of
her
own
kitchen
think
of
such
a
lot
compared
with
that
of
the
head
engineer
of
plantation
whose
sole
wages
are
his
coarse
food
and
raiment
and
miserable
hovel
and
whose
wife
covered
with
one
filthy
garment
of
ragged
texture
and
dingy
colour
and
is
daily
driven
to
labour
with
aching
joints
under
the
lash
of
a
driver
or
lies
languishing
on
the
earthen
floor
of
the
dismal
plantation
hospital
in
a
condition
of
utter
physical
destitution
and
degradation
such
as
the
most
miserable
dwelling
of
the
poorest
inhabitant
of
your
free
northern
villages
never
beheld
the
like
of
think
of
the
rows
of
tidy
tiny
houses
in
the
long
suburbs
of
boston
and
philadelphia
inhabited
by
artisans
of
just
the
same
grade
as
this
poor
ned
with
their
white
doors
and
steps
their
hydrants
of
inexhaustible
fresh
flowing
water
the
innumerable
appliances
for
decent
comfort
of
their
cheerful
rooms
the
gay
wardrobe
of
the
wife
her
cotton
prints
for
daily
use
her
silk
for
sunday
the
careful
comfort
of
the
clothing
the
books
and
newspapers
in
the
little
parlour
the
daily
district
school
the
weekly
parish
church
imagine
if
you
can
but
you
are
happy
that
you
can
not
the
contrast
between
such
an
existence
and
that
of
the
best
mechanic
on
a
southern
plantation
did
you
ever
read
but
i
am
sure
you
never
did
and
no
more
did
i
an
epic
poem
on
fish
well
such
a
one
was
once
written
i
have
forgotten
by
whom
but
assuredly
the
heroine
of
it
ought
to
have
been
the
altamaha
shad
a
delicate
creature
so
superior
to
the
animal
you
northerners
devour
with
greedy
thankfulness
when
the
spring
sends
back
their
finny
drove
to
your
colder
waters
that
one
would
not
suppose
these
were
of
the
same
family
instead
of
being
as
they
really
are
precisely
the
same
fish
certainly
the
mud
of
the
altamaha
must
have
some
most
peculiar
virtues
and
by
the
by
i
have
never
anywhere
tasted
such
delicious
tea
as
that
which
we
make
with
this
same
turbid
stream
the
water
of
which
duly
filtered
of
course
has
some
peculiar
softness
which
affects
the
tea
and
it
is
the
same
we
always
use
in
a
most
curious
and
agreeable
manner
on
my
return
to
the
house
i
found
a
terrible
disturbance
in
consequence
of
the
disappearance
from
under
cook
john
safe
keeping
of
a
ham
had
committed
to
his
charge
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
unfortunate
culinary
slave
had
made
away
in
some
inscrutable
manner
with
the
joint
intended
for
our
table
the
very
lies
he
told
about
it
were
so
curiously
shallow
and
transparent
that
while
they
confirmed
the
fact
of
his
theft
quite
as
much
if
not
more
than
an
absolute
confession
would
have
done
they
provoked
at
once
my
pity
and
my
irrepressible
mirth
to
a
most
painful
degree
was
in
a
state
of
towering
anger
and
indignation
and
besides
a
flogging
sentenced
the
unhappy
cook
to
degradation
from
his
high
and
dignified
position
and
alas
all
its
sweets
of
comparatively
easy
labour
and
good
living
from
the
remains
of
our
table
to
the
hard
toil
coarse
scanty
fare
and
despised
position
of
a
common
field
hand
i
suppose
some
punishment
was
inevitably
necessary
in
such
a
plain
case
of
deliberate
theft
as
this
but
nevertheless
my
whole
soul
revolts
at
the
injustice
of
visiting
upon
these
poor
wretches
a
moral
darkness
which
all
possible
means
are
taken
to
increase
and
perpetuate
in
speaking
of
this
and
the
whole
circumstance
of
john
trespass
to
in
the
evening
i
observed
that
the
ignorance
of
these
poor
people
ought
to
screen
them
from
punishment
he
replied
that
they
knew
well
enough
what
was
right
and
wrong
i
asked
how
they
could
be
expected
to
know
it
he
replied
by
the
means
of
cooper
london
and
the
religious
instruction
he
gave
them
so
that
after
all
the
appeal
is
to
be
made
against
themselves
to
that
moral
and
religious
instruction
which
is
withheld
from
them
and
which
if
they
obtain
it
at
all
is
the
result
of
their
own
unaided
and
unencouraged
exertion
the
more
i
hear
and
see
and
learn
and
ponder
the
whole
of
this
system
of
slavery
the
more
impossible
i
find
it
to
conceive
how
its
practisers
and
upholders
are
to
justify
their
deeds
before
the
tribunal
of
their
own
conscience
or
law
it
is
too
dreadful
to
have
those
whom
we
love
accomplices
to
this
wickedness
it
is
too
intolerable
to
find
myself
an
involuntary
accomplice
to
it
i
had
a
conversation
the
next
morning
with
abraham
cook
john
brother
upon
the
subject
of
his
brother
theft
and
only
think
of
the
saying
that
action
had
brought
disgrace
upon
the
family
does
not
that
sound
very
like
the
very
best
sort
of
free
pride
the
pride
of
character
the
honourable
pride
of
honesty
integrity
and
fidelity
but
this
was
not
all
for
this
same
abraham
a
clever
carpenter
and
much
valued
on
the
estate
went
on
in
answer
to
my
questions
to
tell
me
such
a
story
that
i
declare
to
you
i
felt
as
if
i
could
have
howled
with
helpless
indignation
and
grief
when
he
departed
and
went
to
resume
his
work
his
grandfather
had
been
an
old
slave
in
darien
extremely
clever
as
a
carpenter
and
so
highly
valued
for
his
skill
and
good
character
that
his
master
allowed
him
to
purchase
his
liberty
by
money
which
he
earned
by
working
for
himself
at
odd
times
when
his
task
work
was
over
i
asked
abraham
what
sum
his
grandfather
paid
for
his
freedom
he
said
he
did
not
know
but
he
supposed
a
large
one
because
of
his
being
a
carpenter
and
so
a
peculiarly
valuable
chattel
i
presume
from
what
i
remember
major
m
and
h
saying
on
the
subject
of
the
market
value
of
negroes
in
charleston
and
savannah
that
such
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
would
have
been
worth
from
to
dollars
however
whatever
the
man
paid
for
his
ransom
by
his
grandson
account
fourteen
years
after
he
became
free
when
he
died
he
had
again
amassed
money
to
the
amount
of
dollars
which
he
left
among
his
wife
and
children
the
former
being
a
slave
on
major
estate
where
the
latter
remained
by
virtue
of
that
fact
slaves
also
so
this
man
not
only
bought
his
own
freedom
at
a
cost
of
dollars
but
left
a
little
fortune
of
more
at
his
death
and
then
we
are
told
of
the
universal
idleness
thriftlessness
incorrigible
sloth
and
brutish
incapacity
of
this
inferior
race
of
creatures
whose
only
fitting
and
condition
is
that
of
beasts
of
burthen
to
the
whites
i
do
not
believe
the
whole
low
white
population
of
the
state
of
georgia
could
furnish
such
an
instance
of
energy
industry
and
thrift
as
the
amassing
of
this
laborious
little
fortune
by
this
poor
slave
who
left
nevertheless
his
children
and
grandchildren
to
the
lot
from
which
he
had
so
heroically
ransomed
himself
and
yet
the
white
men
with
whom
i
live
and
talk
tell
me
day
after
day
that
there
is
neither
cruelty
nor
injustice
in
this
accursed
system
about
five
i
went
to
walk
on
the
dykes
and
met
a
gang
of
the
going
to
the
as
the
water
served
them
for
working
then
i
believe
i
have
told
you
that
besides
the
great
steam
mill
there
is
this
which
is
dependent
on
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tide
in
the
river
and
where
the
people
are
therefore
obliged
to
work
by
day
or
night
at
whatever
time
the
water
serves
to
impel
the
wheel
they
greeted
me
with
their
usual
profusion
of
exclamations
petitions
and
benedictions
and
i
parted
from
them
to
come
and
oversee
my
slave
jack
for
whom
i
had
bought
a
spade
and
to
whom
i
had
entrusted
the
task
of
turning
up
some
ground
for
me
in
which
i
wanted
to
establish
some
of
the
narcissus
and
other
flowers
i
had
remarked
about
the
ground
and
the
house
jack
however
was
a
worse
digger
than
adam
could
have
been
when
first
he
turned
his
hand
to
it
after
his
expulsion
from
paradise
i
think
i
could
have
managed
a
spade
with
infinitely
more
efficiency
or
rather
less
incapacity
than
he
displayed
upon
my
expressing
my
amazement
at
his
performance
he
said
the
people
here
never
used
spades
but
performed
all
their
agricultural
operations
with
the
hoe
their
soil
must
be
very
light
and
their
agriculture
very
superficial
i
should
think
however
i
was
obliged
to
terminate
jack
spooning
process
and
abandon
for
the
present
my
hopes
of
a
created
by
his
industry
being
called
into
the
house
to
receive
the
return
visit
of
old
s
as
usual
the
appearance
health
vigour
and
good
management
of
the
children
were
the
theme
of
wondering
admiration
as
usual
my
possession
of
a
white
nurse
the
theme
of
envious
congratulation
as
usual
i
had
to
hear
the
habitual
senseless
complaints
of
the
inefficiency
of
coloured
nurses
if
you
are
half
as
tired
of
the
sameness
and
stupidity
of
the
conversation
of
my
southern
female
neighbours
as
i
am
i
pity
you
but
not
as
much
as
i
pity
them
for
the
stupid
sameness
of
their
most
vapid
existence
which
would
deaden
any
amount
of
intelligence
obliterate
any
amount
of
instruction
and
render
torpid
and
stagnant
any
amount
of
natural
energy
and
vivacity
i
would
rather
die
rather
a
thousand
times
than
live
the
lives
of
these
georgia
planters
wives
and
daughters
s
had
brought
me
some
of
the
delicious
wild
jasmine
that
festoons
her
dreary
drive
and
most
grateful
i
was
for
the
presence
of
the
sweet
wild
nosegay
in
my
highly
unornamental
residence
when
my
visitors
had
left
me
i
took
the
refreshment
of
a
row
over
to
darien
and
as
we
had
the
tide
against
us
coming
back
the
process
was
not
so
refreshing
for
the
rowers
the
evening
was
so
extremely
beautiful
and
the
rising
of
the
moon
so
exquisite
that
instead
of
retreating
to
the
house
when
i
reached
the
island
i
got
into
the
dolphin
my
special
canoe
and
made
jack
paddle
me
down
the
great
river
to
meet
the
lily
which
was
coming
back
from
simon
with
who
has
been
preparing
all
things
for
our
advent
thither
my
letter
has
been
interrupted
dear
e
by
the
breaking
up
of
our
residence
on
the
rice
plantation
and
our
arrival
at
simon
whence
i
now
address
you
we
came
down
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
was
thankful
enough
of
the
fifteen
miles
row
to
rest
in
from
the
labour
of
with
which
the
whole
morning
was
taken
up
and
which
combined
with
packing
and
preparing
all
our
own
personalities
and
those
of
the
children
was
no
sinecure
at
every
moment
one
or
other
of
the
poor
people
rushed
in
upon
me
to
bid
me
many
of
their
farewells
were
grotesque
enough
some
were
pathetic
and
all
of
them
made
me
very
sad
poor
people
how
little
i
have
done
how
little
i
can
do
for
them
i
had
a
long
talk
with
that
interesting
and
excellent
man
cooper
london
who
made
an
earnest
petition
that
i
would
send
him
from
the
north
a
lot
of
bibles
and
prayer
books
certainly
the
science
of
reading
must
be
much
more
common
among
the
negroes
than
i
supposed
or
london
must
look
to
a
marvellously
increased
spread
of
the
same
hereafter
there
is
however
considerable
reticence
upon
this
point
or
else
the
poor
slaves
must
consider
the
mere
possession
of
the
holy
books
as
good
for
salvation
and
as
effectual
for
spiritual
assistance
to
those
who
can
not
as
to
those
who
can
comprehend
them
since
the
news
of
our
departure
has
spread
i
have
had
repeated
eager
entreaties
for
presents
of
bibles
and
prayer
books
and
to
my
demurrer
of
you
ca
read
can
you
have
generally
received
for
answer
a
reluctant
acknowledgement
of
ignorance
which
however
did
not
always
convince
me
of
the
fact
in
my
farewell
conversation
with
london
i
found
it
impossible
to
get
him
to
tell
me
how
he
had
learned
to
read
the
penalties
for
teaching
them
are
very
severe
heavy
fines
increasing
in
amount
for
the
first
and
second
offence
and
imprisonment
for
the
third
such
a
man
as
london
is
certainly
aware
that
to
teach
the
slaves
to
read
is
an
illegal
act
and
he
may
have
been
unwilling
to
betray
whoever
had
been
his
preceptor
even
to
my
knowledge
at
any
rate
i
got
no
answers
from
him
but
missis
me
learn
well
missis
me
try
and
finally
missis
me
heaven
help
me
to
which
i
could
only
reply
that
i
knew
heaven
was
helpful
but
very
hardly
to
the
tune
of
teaching
folks
their
letters
i
got
no
satisfaction
old
jacob
the
father
of
abraham
cook
john
and
poor
psyche
husband
took
a
most
solemn
and
sad
leave
of
me
saying
he
did
not
expect
ever
to
see
me
again
i
could
not
exactly
tell
why
because
though
he
is
aged
and
infirm
the
fifteen
miles
between
the
rice
plantation
and
simon
do
not
appear
so
insuperable
a
barrier
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
places
which
i
represented
to
him
as
a
suggestion
of
consolation
footnote
these
laws
have
been
greatly
increased
in
stringency
and
severity
since
these
letters
were
written
and
has
not
been
reckoned
too
heavy
a
penalty
for
those
who
should
venture
to
offer
these
unfortunate
people
the
fruit
of
that
forbidden
tree
of
knowledge
their
access
to
which
has
appeared
to
their
owners
the
crowning
danger
of
their
own
precarious
existence
among
their
terrible
dependents
i
have
worked
my
fingers
nearly
off
with
making
for
the
last
day
or
two
innumerable
rolls
of
coarse
little
baby
clothes
layettes
for
the
use
of
small
slaves
m
diligently
cutting
and
shaping
and
i
as
diligently
stitching
we
leave
a
good
supply
for
the
hospitals
and
for
the
individual
clients
besides
who
have
besieged
me
ever
since
my
departure
became
imminent
our
voyage
from
the
rice
to
the
cotton
plantation
was
performed
in
the
lily
which
looked
like
a
soldier
baggage
wagon
and
an
emigrant
transport
combined
our
crew
consisted
of
eight
men
forward
in
the
bow
were
miscellaneous
live
stock
pots
pans
household
furniture
kitchen
utensils
and
an
indescribable
variety
of
heterogeneous
necessaries
enthroned
upon
beds
bedding
tables
and
other
chattels
sat
that
poor
pretty
chattel
psyche
with
her
small
chattel
children
midships
sat
the
two
tiny
free
women
and
myself
and
in
the
stern
steering
and
in
the
blue
unclouded
weather
we
rowed
down
the
huge
stream
the
men
keeping
time
and
tune
to
their
oars
with
extemporaneous
chaunts
of
adieu
to
the
rice
island
and
its
denizens
among
other
poetical
and
musical
comments
on
our
departure
recurred
the
assertion
as
a
sort
of
burthen
that
we
were
in
body
but
not
in
mind
from
those
we
left
behind
having
relieved
one
set
of
sentiments
by
this
reflection
they
very
wisely
betook
themselves
to
the
consideration
of
the
blessings
that
remained
to
them
and
performed
a
spirited
chaunt
in
honour
of
psyche
and
our
bouncing
black
housemaid
mary
at
the
end
of
a
fifteen
miles
row
we
entered
one
among
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
arms
or
branches
into
which
the
broad
river
ravels
like
a
fringe
as
it
reaches
the
sea
a
dismal
navigation
along
a
dismal
tract
called
pound
through
a
narrow
cut
or
channel
of
water
divided
from
the
main
stream
the
conch
was
sounded
as
at
our
arrival
at
the
rice
island
and
we
made
our
descent
on
the
famous
long
staple
cotton
island
of
simon
where
we
presently
took
up
our
abode
in
what
had
all
the
appearance
of
an
old
rattling
this
morning
sunday
i
peeped
round
its
immediate
neighbourhood
and
saw
to
my
inexpressible
delight
within
hail
some
evergreen
oaks
and
close
to
the
house
itself
a
tiny
garden
a
plot
of
ground
with
one
or
two
in
full
blossom
tufts
of
silver
narcissus
and
jonquils
a
quantity
of
violets
and
an
exquisite
myrtle
bush
wherefore
i
said
my
prayers
with
especial
gratitude
dearest
e
the
fame
of
my
peculiar
requisitions
has
i
find
preceded
me
here
for
the
babies
that
have
been
presented
to
my
admiring
notice
have
all
been
without
caps
also
however
without
socks
to
their
opposite
little
wretched
extremities
but
that
does
not
signify
quite
so
much
the
people
too
that
i
saw
yesterday
were
remarkably
clean
and
tidy
to
be
sure
it
was
sunday
the
whole
day
till
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
the
house
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
our
poor
dependents
waiting
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
myself
or
the
children
and
until
from
sheer
weariness
i
was
obliged
to
shut
the
doors
an
incessant
stream
poured
in
and
out
whose
various
modes
of
salutation
greeting
and
welcome
were
more
grotesque
and
pathetic
at
the
same
time
than
anything
you
can
imagine
in
the
afternoon
i
walked
with
to
see
a
new
house
in
process
of
erection
which
when
it
is
finished
is
to
be
the
overseer
abode
and
our
residence
during
any
future
visits
we
may
pay
to
the
estate
i
was
horrified
at
the
dismal
site
selected
and
the
hideous
house
erected
on
it
it
is
true
that
the
central
position
is
the
principal
consideration
in
the
overseer
location
but
both
position
and
building
seemed
to
me
to
witness
to
an
inveterate
love
of
ugliness
or
at
any
rate
a
deadness
to
every
desire
of
beauty
nothing
short
of
horrible
and
for
my
own
part
i
think
it
is
intolerable
to
have
to
leave
the
point
where
the
waters
meet
and
where
a
few
fine
picturesque
old
trees
are
scattered
about
to
come
to
this
place
even
for
the
very
short
time
i
am
ever
likely
to
spend
here
in
every
direction
our
view
as
we
returned
was
bounded
by
thickets
of
the
most
beautiful
and
various
evergreen
growth
which
beckoned
my
inexperience
most
irresistibly
said
to
my
unutterable
horror
that
they
were
perfectly
infested
with
rattlesnakes
and
i
must
on
no
account
go
about
the
bush
in
these
latitudes
as
the
game
i
should
be
likely
to
start
would
be
anything
but
agreeable
to
me
we
saw
quantities
of
wild
all
silvery
with
blossoms
and
in
lovely
companionship
and
contrast
with
them
a
beautiful
shrub
covered
with
delicate
pink
bloom
like
flowering
after
that
life
in
the
where
the
altamaha
kept
looking
over
the
dyke
at
me
all
the
time
as
i
sat
in
the
house
writing
or
working
it
is
pleasant
to
be
on
again
and
to
know
that
the
river
is
at
the
conventional
not
to
say
natural
depth
below
its
banks
and
under
my
feet
instead
of
over
my
head
the
two
plantations
are
of
diametrically
opposite
dispositions
that
is
all
swamp
and
this
all
sand
or
to
speak
more
accurately
that
is
all
swamp
and
all
of
this
that
is
not
swamp
is
sand
on
our
way
home
we
met
a
most
extraordinary
creature
of
the
negro
kind
who
coming
towards
us
halted
and
caused
us
to
halt
straight
in
the
middle
of
the
path
when
bending
himself
down
till
his
hands
almost
touched
the
ground
he
exclaimed
to
your
most
obedient
and
then
with
a
kick
and
a
flourish
altogether
indescribable
he
drew
to
the
side
of
the
path
to
let
us
pass
which
we
did
perfectly
shouting
with
laughter
which
broke
out
again
every
time
we
looked
at
each
other
and
stopped
to
take
breath
so
sudden
grotesque
uncouth
and
yet
dexterous
a
gambado
never
came
into
the
brain
or
out
of
the
limbs
of
anything
but
a
i
observed
among
the
numerous
groups
that
we
passed
or
met
a
much
larger
proportion
of
mulattoes
than
at
the
upon
asking
why
this
was
so
he
said
that
there
no
white
person
could
land
without
his
or
the
overseer
permission
whereas
on
simon
which
is
a
large
island
containing
several
plantations
belonging
to
different
owners
of
course
the
number
of
whites
both
residing
on
and
visiting
the
place
was
much
greater
and
the
opportunity
for
intercourse
between
the
blacks
and
whites
much
more
frequent
while
we
were
still
on
this
subject
a
filthy
woman
met
us
with
a
little
child
in
her
arms
a
very
light
mulatto
whose
extraordinary
resemblance
to
driver
bran
one
of
the
officials
who
had
been
duly
presented
to
me
on
my
arrival
and
who
was
himself
a
mulatto
struck
me
directly
i
pointed
it
out
to
who
merely
answered
likely
his
child
said
i
you
never
remark
that
driver
bran
is
the
exact
image
of
mr
k
likely
his
brother
was
the
reply
all
which
rather
unpleasant
state
of
relationships
seemed
accepted
as
such
a
complete
matter
of
course
that
i
felt
rather
uncomfortable
and
said
no
more
about
who
was
like
who
but
came
to
certain
conclusions
in
my
own
mind
as
to
a
young
lad
who
had
been
among
our
morning
visitors
and
whose
extremely
light
colour
and
straight
handsome
features
and
striking
resemblance
to
k
had
suggested
suspicions
of
a
rather
unpleasant
nature
to
me
and
whose
parent
was
a
very
black
negress
of
the
name
of
minda
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
now
that
he
is
another
son
of
k
paragon
overseer
as
we
drew
near
the
house
again
we
were
gradually
joined
by
such
a
numerous
escort
of
slaves
that
it
was
almost
with
difficulty
we
could
walk
along
the
path
they
buzzed
and
hummed
and
swarmed
round
us
like
flies
and
the
heat
and
dust
consequent
upon
this
friendly
companionship
were
a
most
unpleasant
addition
to
the
labour
of
walking
in
the
sandy
soil
through
which
we
were
ploughing
i
was
not
sorry
when
we
entered
the
house
and
left
our
bodyguard
outside
in
the
evening
i
looked
over
the
plan
of
the
delightful
residence
i
had
visited
in
the
morning
and
could
not
help
suggesting
to
the
advantage
to
be
gained
in
point
of
picturesqueness
by
merely
turning
the
house
round
it
is
but
a
wooden
frame
one
after
all
and
your
folks
east
would
think
no
more
of
inviting
it
to
face
about
than
if
it
was
built
of
cards
but
the
fact
is
here
nothing
signifies
except
the
cotton
crop
and
whether
one
nose
is
in
a
swamp
and
one
eyes
in
a
is
of
no
consequence
whatever
either
to
oneself
if
oneself
was
not
i
or
anyone
else
i
find
here
an
immense
proportion
of
old
people
the
work
and
the
climate
of
the
rice
plantation
require
the
strongest
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
estate
the
cotton
crop
is
no
longer
by
any
means
as
paramount
in
value
as
it
used
to
be
and
the
climate
soil
and
labour
of
simon
are
better
adapted
to
old
young
and
feeble
cultivators
than
the
swamp
fields
of
the
i
wonder
if
i
ever
told
you
of
the
enormous
decrease
in
value
of
this
same
famous
long
staple
cotton
when
major
grandfather
first
sent
the
produce
of
this
plantation
where
we
now
are
to
england
it
was
of
so
fine
a
quality
that
it
used
to
be
quoted
by
itself
in
the
liverpool
cotton
market
and
was
then
worth
half
a
guinea
a
pound
it
is
now
not
worth
a
shilling
a
pound
this
was
told
me
by
the
gentleman
in
liverpool
who
has
been
factor
for
this
estate
for
thirty
years
such
a
decrease
as
this
in
the
value
of
one
crop
and
the
steady
increase
at
the
same
time
of
a
slave
population
now
numbering
between
and
bodies
to
clothe
and
house
mouths
to
feed
while
the
land
is
being
exhausted
by
the
careless
and
wasteful
nature
of
the
agriculture
itself
suggests
a
pretty
serious
prospect
of
declining
prosperity
and
indeed
unless
these
georgia
cotton
planters
can
command
more
land
or
lay
abundant
capital
which
they
have
not
being
almost
all
of
them
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
upon
that
which
has
already
spent
its
virgin
vigour
it
is
a
very
obvious
thing
that
they
must
all
very
soon
be
eaten
up
by
their
own
property
the
rice
plantations
are
a
great
thing
to
fall
back
upon
under
these
circumstances
and
the
rice
crop
is
now
quite
as
valuable
if
not
more
so
than
the
cotton
one
on
estates
once
so
famous
and
prosperous
through
the
latter
i
find
any
number
of
all
but
superannuated
men
and
women
here
whose
tales
of
the
former
grandeur
of
the
estate
and
family
are
like
things
one
reads
of
in
novels
one
old
woman
who
crawled
to
see
me
and
could
hardly
lift
her
poor
bowed
head
high
enough
to
look
in
my
face
had
been
in
major
establishment
in
philadelphia
and
told
with
infinite
pride
of
having
waited
upon
his
daughters
and
sisters
yet
here
she
is
flung
by
like
an
old
rag
crippled
with
age
and
disease
living
or
rather
dying
by
slow
degrees
in
a
miserable
hovel
such
as
no
decent
household
servant
would
at
the
north
i
suppose
ever
set
their
foot
in
the
poor
old
creature
complained
bitterly
to
me
of
all
her
ailments
and
all
her
wants
i
can
do
little
alas
for
either
i
had
a
visit
from
another
tottering
old
crone
called
dorcas
who
all
but
went
on
her
knees
as
she
wrung
and
kissed
my
hands
with
her
came
my
friend
molly
the
grandmother
of
the
poor
runaway
girl
louisa
whose
story
i
wrote
you
some
little
time
ago
i
had
to
hear
it
all
over
again
it
being
the
newest
event
evidently
in
molly
life
and
it
ended
as
before
with
the
highly
reasonable
proposition
say
missis
what
for
niggar
run
away
snake
eat
em
up
or
dey
starve
to
def
in
a
swamp
massa
niggars
dey
do
nebbar
run
away
if
i
was
niggars
i
i
should
run
away
either
with
only
those
alternatives
but
when
i
look
at
these
wretches
and
at
the
sea
that
rolls
round
this
island
and
think
how
near
the
english
west
indies
and
freedom
are
it
gives
me
a
pretty
severe
twinge
at
the
heart
dearest
e
i
am
afraid
my
letters
must
be
becoming
very
wearisome
to
you
for
if
as
the
runs
is
charming
they
certainly
can
not
be
so
unless
monotony
is
also
charming
a
thing
not
impossible
to
some
minds
but
of
which
the
makes
no
mention
but
what
will
you
as
the
french
say
my
days
are
no
more
different
from
one
another
than
peas
in
a
dish
or
sands
on
the
shore
is
a
pleasant
enough
life
to
live
for
one
who
like
myself
has
a
passion
for
dulness
but
it
affords
small
matter
for
epistolary
correspondence
i
suppose
it
is
the
surfeit
of
excitement
that
i
had
in
my
youth
that
has
made
a
life
of
quiet
monotony
so
extremely
agreeable
to
me
it
is
like
stillness
after
loud
noise
twilight
after
glare
rest
after
labour
there
is
enough
strangeness
too
in
everything
that
surrounds
me
here
to
interest
and
excite
me
agreeably
and
sufficiently
and
i
should
like
the
wild
savage
loneliness
of
the
far
away
existence
extremely
if
it
were
not
for
the
one
small
item
of
slavery
i
had
a
curious
visit
this
morning
from
half
a
dozen
of
the
women
among
whom
were
driver
morris
wife
and
venus
a
hideous
old
goddess
she
was
to
be
sure
driver
bran
mother
they
came
especially
to
see
the
children
who
are
always
eagerly
asked
for
and
hugely
admired
by
their
sooty
dependents
these
poor
women
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
little
white
piccaninnies
and
were
loud
and
profuse
in
their
expressions
of
gratitude
to
massa
for
getting
married
and
having
children
a
matter
of
thankfulness
which
though
it
always
makes
me
laugh
very
much
is
a
most
serious
one
to
them
for
the
continuance
of
the
family
keeps
the
estate
and
slaves
from
the
hammer
and
the
poor
wretches
besides
seeing
in
every
new
child
born
to
their
owners
a
security
against
their
own
banishment
from
the
only
home
they
know
and
separation
from
all
ties
of
kindred
and
habit
and
dispersion
to
distant
plantations
not
unnaturally
look
for
a
milder
rule
from
masters
who
are
the
children
of
their
masters
the
relation
of
owner
and
slave
may
be
expected
to
lose
some
of
its
harsher
features
and
no
doubt
in
some
instances
does
so
when
it
is
on
each
side
the
inheritance
of
successive
generations
and
so
slaves
laud
and
applaud
and
thank
and
bless
him
for
having
married
and
endowed
their
children
with
two
little
future
mistresses
one
of
these
women
a
diana
by
name
went
down
on
her
knees
and
uttered
in
a
loud
voice
a
sort
of
extemporaneous
prayer
of
thanksgiving
at
our
advent
in
which
the
sacred
and
the
profane
were
most
ludicrously
mingled
her
to
de
good
lord
god
almighty
that
missus
had
come
what
give
de
poor
niggar
sugar
and
flannel
and
dat
him
hab
brought
de
missis
and
de
two
little
misses
down
among
de
people
were
really
too
grotesque
and
yet
certainly
more
sincere
acts
of
thanksgiving
are
not
often
uttered
among
the
solemn
and
decorous
ones
that
are
offered
up
to
heaven
for
received
i
find
the
people
here
much
more
inclined
to
talk
than
those
on
the
they
have
less
to
do
and
more
leisure
and
bestow
it
very
liberally
on
me
moreover
the
poor
old
women
of
whom
there
are
so
many
turned
out
to
grass
here
and
of
whom
i
have
spoken
to
you
before
though
they
are
past
work
are
by
no
means
past
gossip
and
the
stories
they
have
to
tell
of
the
former
government
of
the
estate
under
old
massa
k
are
certainly
pretty
tremendous
illustrations
of
the
merits
of
slavery
as
a
moral
institution
this
man
the
father
of
the
late
owner
r
k
was
major
agent
in
the
management
of
this
property
and
a
more
cruel
and
unscrupulous
one
as
regards
the
slaves
themselves
whatever
he
may
have
been
in
his
dealings
with
the
master
i
should
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
even
among
the
cruel
and
unscrupulous
class
to
which
he
belonged
in
a
conversation
with
old
molly
as
she
is
called
to
distinguish
her
from
all
other
mollies
on
the
estate
she
having
had
the
honour
of
being
a
servant
in
major
house
for
many
years
i
asked
her
if
the
relation
between
men
and
women
who
are
what
they
call
married
who
have
agreed
to
live
together
as
man
and
wife
the
only
species
of
marriage
formerly
allowed
on
the
estate
i
believe
now
london
may
read
the
marriage
service
to
them
was
considered
binding
by
the
people
themselves
and
by
the
overseer
she
said
much
formerly
and
that
the
people
be
expected
to
have
much
regard
to
such
an
engagement
utterly
ignored
as
it
was
by
k
whose
invariable
rule
if
he
heard
of
any
disagreement
between
a
man
and
woman
calling
themselves
married
was
immediately
to
bestow
them
in
on
other
parties
whether
they
chose
it
or
not
by
which
summary
process
the
slightest
of
temper
received
the
relief
of
a
divorce
more
rapid
and
easy
than
even
germany
could
afford
and
the
estate
lost
nothing
by
any
prolongation
of
celibacy
on
either
side
of
course
the
misery
consequent
upon
such
arbitrary
destruction
of
voluntary
and
imposition
of
involuntary
ties
was
nothing
to
k
i
was
very
sorry
to
hear
that
o
the
overseer
at
the
of
whom
i
have
made
mention
to
you
more
than
once
in
my
letters
had
had
one
of
the
men
flogged
very
severely
for
getting
his
wife
baptised
i
was
quite
unable
from
the
account
i
received
to
understand
what
his
objection
had
been
to
the
poor
man
desire
to
make
his
wife
at
least
a
formal
christian
but
it
does
seem
dreadful
that
such
an
act
should
be
so
visited
i
almost
wish
i
was
back
again
at
the
for
though
this
is
every
way
the
pleasanter
residence
i
hear
so
much
more
that
is
intolerable
of
the
treatment
of
the
slaves
from
those
i
find
here
that
my
life
is
really
made
wretched
by
it
there
is
not
a
single
natural
right
that
is
not
taken
away
from
these
unfortunate
people
and
the
worst
of
all
is
that
their
condition
does
not
appear
to
me
upon
further
observation
of
it
to
be
susceptible
of
even
partial
alleviation
as
long
as
the
fundamental
evil
the
slavery
itself
remains
my
letter
was
interrupted
as
usual
by
clamours
for
my
presence
at
the
door
and
petitions
for
sugar
rice
and
baby
clothes
from
a
group
of
women
who
had
done
their
tasks
at
three
in
the
afternoon
and
had
come
to
say
do
missis
how
do
you
do
and
beg
something
on
their
way
to
their
huts
observing
one
among
them
whose
hand
was
badly
maimed
one
finger
being
reduced
to
a
mere
stump
she
told
me
it
was
in
consequence
of
the
bite
of
a
rattlesnake
which
had
attacked
and
bitten
her
child
and
then
struck
her
as
she
endeavoured
to
kill
it
her
little
boy
had
died
but
one
of
the
drivers
cut
off
her
finger
and
so
she
had
escaped
with
the
loss
of
that
member
only
it
is
yet
too
early
in
the
season
for
me
to
make
acquaintance
with
these
delightful
animals
but
the
accounts
the
negroes
give
of
their
abundance
is
full
of
agreeable
promise
for
the
future
it
seems
singular
considering
how
very
common
they
are
that
there
are
not
more
frequent
instances
of
the
slaves
being
bitten
by
them
to
be
sure
they
seem
to
me
to
have
a
holy
horror
of
ever
setting
their
feet
near
either
tree
or
bush
or
anywhere
but
on
the
open
road
and
the
fields
where
they
labour
and
of
course
the
snakes
are
not
so
frequent
in
open
and
frequented
places
as
in
their
proper
coverts
the
red
indians
are
said
to
use
successfully
some
vegetable
cure
for
the
bite
i
believe
the
leaves
of
the
slippery
ash
or
elm
the
only
infallible
remedy
however
is
suction
but
of
this
the
ignorant
negroes
are
so
afraid
that
they
never
can
be
induced
to
have
recourse
to
it
being
of
course
immovably
persuaded
that
the
poison
which
is
so
fatal
to
the
blood
must
be
equally
so
to
the
stomach
they
tell
me
that
the
cattle
wandering
into
the
brakes
and
bushes
are
often
bitten
to
death
by
these
deadly
creatures
the
pigs
whose
fat
it
seems
does
not
accept
the
venom
into
its
tissues
with
the
same
effect
escape
unhurt
for
the
most
part
so
much
for
the
virtue
of
adipose
matter
a
consolatory
consideration
for
such
of
us
as
are
inclined
to
take
on
flesh
more
than
we
think
graceful
morning
this
letter
has
been
long
on
the
stocks
dear
e
i
have
been
busy
all
day
and
tired
and
lazy
in
the
evening
latterly
and
moreover
feel
as
if
such
very
dull
matter
was
hardly
worth
sending
all
the
way
off
to
where
you
are
happy
to
be
however
that
is
nonsense
i
know
well
enough
that
you
are
glad
to
hear
from
me
be
it
what
it
will
and
so
i
resume
my
chronicle
some
of
my
evenings
have
been
spent
in
reading
clay
speech
and
making
notes
on
it
which
i
will
show
you
when
we
meet
what
a
cruel
pity
and
what
a
cruel
shame
it
is
that
such
a
man
should
either
know
no
better
or
do
no
better
for
his
country
than
he
is
doing
now
yesterday
i
for
the
first
time
bethought
me
of
the
riding
privileges
of
which
jack
used
to
make
such
magnificent
mention
when
he
was
fishing
with
me
at
the
and
desiring
to
visit
the
remoter
parts
of
the
plantation
and
the
other
end
of
the
island
i
enquired
into
the
resources
of
the
stable
i
was
told
i
could
have
a
mare
with
foal
but
i
declined
adding
my
weight
to
what
the
poor
beast
already
carried
and
my
only
choice
then
was
between
one
who
had
just
foaled
or
a
fine
stallion
used
as
a
plough
horse
on
the
plantation
i
determined
for
the
latter
and
shall
probably
be
handsomely
shaken
whenever
i
take
my
rides
abroad
the
my
dearest
e
i
write
to
you
in
great
depression
and
distress
i
have
had
a
most
painful
conversation
with
who
has
declined
receiving
any
of
the
people
petitions
through
me
whether
he
is
wearied
with
the
number
of
these
prayers
and
supplications
which
he
would
escape
but
for
me
as
they
probably
would
not
venture
to
come
so
incessantly
to
him
and
i
of
course
feel
bound
to
bring
every
one
confided
to
me
to
him
or
whether
he
has
been
annoyed
at
the
number
of
pitiful
and
horrible
stories
of
misery
and
oppression
under
the
former
rule
of
k
which
have
come
to
my
knowledge
since
i
have
been
here
and
the
grief
and
indignation
caused
but
which
can
not
by
any
means
always
be
done
away
with
though
their
expression
may
be
silenced
by
his
angry
exclamations
of
do
you
listen
to
such
stuff
or
do
you
believe
such
trash
do
you
know
the
niggers
are
all
d
d
liars
i
do
not
know
but
he
desired
me
this
morning
to
bring
him
no
more
complaints
or
requests
of
any
sort
as
the
people
had
hitherto
had
no
such
advocate
and
had
done
very
well
without
and
i
was
only
kept
in
an
incessant
state
of
excitement
with
all
the
falsehoods
they
they
could
make
me
believe
how
well
they
have
done
without
my
advocacy
the
conditions
which
i
see
with
my
own
eyes
even
more
than
their
pitiful
petitions
demonstrate
it
is
indeed
true
that
the
sufferings
of
those
who
come
to
me
for
redress
and
still
more
the
injustice
done
to
the
great
majority
who
can
not
have
filled
my
heart
with
bitterness
and
indignation
that
have
overflowed
my
lips
till
i
suppose
is
weary
of
hearing
what
he
has
never
heard
before
the
voice
of
passionate
expostulation
and
importunate
pleading
against
wrongs
that
he
will
not
even
acknowledge
and
for
creatures
whose
common
humanity
with
his
own
i
half
think
he
does
not
believe
but
i
must
return
to
the
north
for
my
condition
would
be
almost
worse
than
theirs
condemned
to
hear
and
see
so
much
wretchedness
not
only
without
the
means
of
alleviating
it
but
without
permission
even
to
represent
it
for
alleviation
this
is
no
place
for
me
since
i
was
not
born
among
slaves
and
can
not
bear
to
live
among
them
perhaps
after
all
what
he
says
is
true
when
i
am
gone
they
will
fall
back
into
the
desperate
uncomplaining
habit
of
suffering
from
which
my
coming
among
them
willing
to
hear
and
ready
to
help
has
tempted
them
he
says
that
bringing
their
complaints
to
me
and
the
sight
of
my
credulous
commiseration
only
tend
to
make
them
discontented
and
idle
and
brings
renewed
chastisement
upon
them
and
that
so
instead
of
really
befriending
them
i
am
only
preparing
more
suffering
for
them
whenever
i
leave
the
place
and
they
can
no
more
cry
to
me
for
help
and
so
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
and
leave
them
to
their
fate
perhaps
too
he
is
afraid
of
the
mere
contagion
of
freedom
which
breathes
from
the
very
existence
of
those
who
are
free
my
way
of
speaking
to
the
people
of
treating
them
of
living
with
them
the
appeals
i
make
to
their
sense
of
truth
of
duty
of
the
infinite
compassion
and
the
human
consideration
i
feel
for
them
all
this
of
course
makes
my
intercourse
with
them
dangerously
suggestive
of
relations
far
different
from
anything
they
have
ever
known
and
as
o
once
almost
hinted
to
me
my
existence
among
slaves
was
an
element
of
danger
to
the
if
i
should
go
away
the
human
sympathy
that
i
have
felt
for
them
will
certainly
never
come
near
them
again
i
was
too
unhappy
to
write
any
more
my
dear
friend
and
you
have
been
spared
the
rest
of
my
paroxysm
which
hereabouts
culminated
in
the
blessed
refuge
of
abundant
tears
god
will
provide
he
has
not
forgotten
nor
will
he
forsake
these
his
poor
children
and
if
i
may
no
longer
minister
to
them
they
yet
are
in
his
hand
who
cares
for
them
more
and
better
than
i
can
towards
the
afternoon
yesterday
i
rowed
up
the
river
to
the
by
way
of
refreshment
to
my
spirits
and
came
back
wednesday
the
through
rather
a
severe
storm
before
going
to
bed
last
night
i
finished
clay
speech
and
ground
my
teeth
over
it
before
starting
this
morning
i
received
from
frank
a
lesson
on
the
various
qualities
of
the
various
sorts
of
rice
and
should
be
at
any
rate
till
i
forget
all
he
told
me
which
i
in
my
bones
will
be
soon
a
competent
judge
and
expert
saleswoman
the
dead
white
speck
which
shows
itself
sometimes
in
rice
as
it
does
in
teeth
is
in
the
former
as
in
the
latter
a
sign
of
decay
the
finest
quality
of
rice
is
what
may
be
called
flinty
clear
and
unclouded
and
a
pretty
clean
thing
it
is
i
will
tell
you
something
curious
and
pleasant
about
my
row
back
the
wind
was
so
high
and
the
river
so
rough
when
i
left
the
that
just
as
i
was
about
to
get
into
the
boat
i
thought
it
might
not
be
amiss
to
carry
my
with
me
and
ran
back
to
the
house
to
fetch
it
having
taken
that
much
care
for
my
life
i
jumped
into
the
boat
and
we
pushed
off
the
fifteen
miles
row
with
a
furious
wind
and
part
of
the
time
the
tide
against
us
and
the
huge
broad
turbid
river
broken
into
a
foaming
sea
of
angry
waves
was
a
pretty
severe
task
for
the
men
they
pulled
with
a
will
however
but
i
had
to
forego
the
usual
accompaniment
of
their
voices
for
the
labour
was
tremendous
especially
towards
the
end
of
our
voyage
where
of
course
the
nearness
of
the
sea
increased
the
roughness
of
the
water
terribly
the
men
were
in
great
spirits
however
there
were
eight
of
them
rowing
and
one
behind
was
steering
one
of
them
said
something
which
elicited
an
exclamation
of
general
assent
and
i
asked
what
it
was
the
steerer
said
they
were
pleased
because
there
was
not
another
planter
lady
in
all
georgia
who
would
have
gone
through
the
storm
all
alone
with
them
in
a
boat
without
the
protecting
presence
of
a
white
man
said
i
good
fellows
if
the
boat
capsized
or
anything
happened
i
am
sure
i
should
have
nine
chances
for
my
life
instead
of
one
at
this
there
was
one
shout
of
you
would
missis
true
for
dat
missis
and
in
great
mutual
we
reached
the
landing
at
hampton
point
as
i
walked
home
i
pondered
over
this
compliment
of
slaves
to
me
and
did
not
feel
quite
sure
that
the
very
absence
of
the
fear
which
haunts
the
southern
women
in
their
intercourse
with
these
people
and
prevents
them
from
trusting
themselves
ever
with
them
out
of
reach
of
white
companionship
and
supervision
was
not
one
of
the
circumstances
which
makes
my
intercourse
with
them
unsafe
and
undesirable
the
idea
of
apprehending
any
mischief
from
them
never
yet
crossed
my
brain
and
in
the
perfect
confidence
with
which
i
go
amongst
them
they
must
perceive
a
curious
difference
between
me
and
my
lady
neighbours
in
these
parts
all
have
expressed
unbounded
astonishment
at
my
doing
so
the
spring
is
fast
coming
on
and
we
shall
i
suppose
soon
leave
georgia
how
new
and
sad
a
chapter
of
my
life
this
winter
here
has
been
dear
e
i
can
not
give
way
to
the
bitter
impatience
i
feel
at
my
present
position
and
come
back
to
the
north
without
leaving
my
babies
and
though
i
suppose
their
stay
will
not
in
any
case
be
much
prolonged
in
these
regions
of
swamp
and
slavery
i
must
for
their
sakes
remain
where
they
are
and
learn
this
dreary
lesson
of
human
suffering
to
the
end
the
record
it
seems
to
me
must
be
utterly
wearisome
to
you
as
the
instances
themselves
i
suppose
in
a
given
time
thanks
to
that
dreadful
reconciler
to
all
that
is
evil
habit
would
become
to
me
this
morning
i
had
a
visit
from
two
of
the
women
charlotte
and
judy
who
came
to
me
for
help
and
advice
for
a
complaint
which
it
really
seems
to
me
every
other
woman
on
the
estate
is
cursed
with
and
which
is
a
direct
result
of
the
conditions
of
their
existence
the
practice
of
sending
women
to
labour
in
the
fields
in
the
third
week
after
their
confinement
is
a
specific
for
causing
this
infirmity
and
i
know
no
specific
for
curing
it
under
these
circumstances
as
soon
as
these
poor
things
had
departed
with
such
comfort
as
i
could
give
them
and
the
bandages
they
especially
begged
for
three
other
sable
graces
introduced
themselves
edie
louisa
and
diana
the
former
told
me
she
had
had
a
family
of
seven
children
but
had
lost
them
all
through
luck
as
she
denominated
the
ignorance
and
ill
treatment
which
were
answerable
for
the
loss
of
these
as
of
so
many
other
poor
little
creatures
their
fellows
having
dismissed
her
and
diana
with
the
sugar
and
rice
they
came
to
beg
i
detained
louisa
whom
i
had
never
seen
but
in
the
presence
of
her
old
grandmother
whose
version
of
the
poor
child
escape
to
and
hiding
in
the
woods
i
had
a
desire
to
compare
with
the
heroine
own
story
she
told
it
very
simply
and
it
was
most
pathetic
she
had
not
finished
her
task
one
day
when
she
said
she
felt
ill
and
unable
to
do
so
and
had
been
severely
flogged
by
driver
bran
in
whose
she
then
was
the
next
day
in
spite
of
this
encouragement
to
labour
she
had
again
been
unable
to
complete
her
appointed
work
and
bran
having
told
her
that
he
tie
her
up
and
flog
her
if
she
did
not
get
it
done
she
had
left
the
field
and
run
into
the
swamp
you
up
louisa
said
i
is
that
she
then
described
to
me
that
they
were
fastened
up
by
their
wrists
to
a
beam
or
a
branch
of
a
tree
their
feet
barely
touching
the
ground
so
as
to
allow
them
no
purchase
for
resistance
or
evasion
of
the
lash
their
clothes
turned
over
their
heads
and
their
backs
scored
with

thong

by
the
driver
himself
or
if
he
pleases
to
inflict
their
punishment
by
deputy
any
of
the
men
he
may
choose
to
summon
to
the
office
it
might
be
father
brother
husband
or
lover
if
the
overseer
so
ordered
it
i
turned
sick
and
my
blood
curdled
listening
to
these
details
from
the
slender
young
slip
of
a
lassie
with
her
poor
piteous
face
and
murmuring
pleading
voice
said
i
but
the
rattlesnakes
the
dreadful
rattlesnakes
in
the
swamps
were
you
not
afraid
of
those
horrible
creatures
missis
said
the
poor
child
no
tink
of
dem
me
forget
all
dem
for
de
fretting
did
you
come
home
at
last
missis
me
starve
with
hunger
me
most
dead
with
hunger
before
me
come
back
were
you
flogged
louisa
said
i
with
a
shudder
at
what
the
answer
might
be
missis
me
go
to
hospital
me
almost
dead
and
sick
so
long
driver
bran
him
forgot
de
flogging
i
am
getting
perfectly
savage
over
all
these
doings
e
and
really
think
i
should
consider
my
own
throat
and
those
of
my
children
well
cut
if
some
night
the
people
were
to
take
it
into
their
heads
to
clear
off
scores
in
that
fashion
the
calibanish
wonderment
of
all
my
visitors
at
the
exceedingly
coarse
and
simple
furniture
and
rustic
means
of
comfort
of
my
abode
is
very
droll
i
have
never
inhabited
any
apartment
so
perfectly
devoid
of
what
we
should
consider
the
common
decencies
of
life
but
to
them
my
rude
sofa
and
common
table
with
its
green
baize
cloth
seem
the
adornings
of
a
palace
and
often
in
the
evening
when
my
bairns
are
asleep
and
m
keeping
watch
over
them
and
i
sit
writing
this
daily
history
for
your
edification
the
door
of
the
great
room
is
opened
stealthily
and
one
after
another
men
and
women
come
trooping
silently
in
their
naked
feet
falling
all
but
inaudibly
on
the
bare
boards
as
they
betake
themselves
to
the
hearth
where
they
squat
down
on
their
hams
in
a
circle
the
bright
blaze
from
the
huge
pine
logs
which
is
the
only
light
of
this
half
of
the
room
shining
on
their
sooty
limbs
and
faces
and
making
them
look
like
a
ring
of
ebony
idols
surrounding
my
domestic
hearth
i
have
had
as
many
as
fourteen
at
a
time
squatting
silently
there
for
nearly
half
an
hour
watching
me
writing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
the
candles
on
my
table
give
only
light
enough
for
my
own
occupation
the
fire
light
illuminates
the
rest
of
the
apartment
and
you
can
not
imagine
anything
stranger
than
the
effect
of
all
these
glassy
whites
of
eyes
and
grinning
white
teeth
turned
towards
me
and
shining
in
the
flickering
light
i
very
often
take
no
notice
of
them
at
all
and
they
seem
perfectly
absorbed
in
contemplating
me
my
evening
dress
probably
excites
their
wonder
and
admiration
no
less
than
my
rapid
and
continuous
writing
for
which
they
have
sometimes
expressed
compassion
as
if
they
thought
it
must
be
more
laborious
than
hoeing
sometimes
at
the
end
of
my
day
journal
i
look
up
and
say
suddenly
what
do
you
want
when
each
black
figure
springs
up
at
once
as
if
moved
by
machinery
they
all
answer
come
say
ha
do
how
d
do
missis
and
then
they
troop
out
as
noiselessly
as
they
entered
like
a
procession
of
sable
dreams
and
i
go
off
in
search
if
possible
of
whiter
ones
two
days
ago
i
had
a
visit
of
great
interest
to
me
from
several
lads
from
twelve
to
sixteen
years
old
who
had
come
to
beg
me
to
give
them
work
to
make
you
understand
this
you
must
know
that
wishing
very
much
to
cut
some
walks
and
drives
through
the
very
picturesque
patches
of
woodland
not
far
from
the
house
i
announced
through
jack
my
desire
to
give
employment
in
the
line
to
as
many
lads
as
chose
when
their
unpaid
task
was
done
to
come
and
do
some
work
for
me
for
which
i
engaged
to
pay
them
at
the
risk
of
producing
a
most
dangerous
process
of
reflection
and
calculation
in
their
brains
i
have
persisted
in
paying
what
i
considered
wages
to
every
slave
that
has
been
my
servant
and
these
my
labourers
must
of
course
be
free
to
work
or
no
as
they
like
and
if
they
work
for
me
must
be
paid
by
me
the
proposition
met
with
unmingled
approbation
from
my
but
i
think
it
might
be
considered
dangerously
suggestive
of
the
rightful
relation
between
work
and
wages
in
short
very
involuntarily
no
doubt
but
nevertheless
very
effectually
i
am
disseminating
ideas
among
dependents
the
like
of
which
have
certainly
never
before
visited
their
brains
march
last
night
after
writing
so
much
to
you
i
felt
weary
and
went
out
into
the
air
to
refresh
my
spirit
the
scene
just
beyond
the
house
was
beautiful
the
moonlight
slept
on
the
broad
river
which
here
is
almost
the
sea
and
on
the
masses
of
foliage
of
the
great
southern
oaks
the
golden
stars
of
german
poetry
shone
in
the
purple
curtains
of
the
night
and
the
measured
rush
of
the
atlantic
unfurling
its
huge
skirts
upon
the
white
sands
of
the
beach
the
sweetest
and
most
awful
lullaby
in
nature
resounded
through
the
silent
air
i
have
not
felt
well
and
have
been
much
depressed
for
some
days
past
i
think
i
should
die
if
i
had
to
live
here
this
morning
in
order
not
to
die
yet
i
thought
i
had
better
take
a
ride
and
accordingly
mounted
the
horse
which
i
told
you
was
one
of
the
equestrian
alternatives
offered
me
here
but
no
sooner
did
he
feel
my
weight
which
after
all
is
mere
levity
and
frivolity
to
him
than
he
thought
proper
to
rebel
and
find
the
grasshopper
a
burthen
and
rear
and
otherwise
demonstrate
his
disgust
i
have
not
ridden
for
a
long
time
now
but
montreal
opposition
very
presently
aroused
the
amazon
which
is
both
natural
and
acquired
in
me
and
i
made
him
comprehend
that
though
i
object
to
slaves
i
expect
obedient
servants
which
views
of
mine
being
imparted
by
a
due
administration
of
both
spur
and
whip
attended
with
a
judicious
combination
of
coaxing
pats
on
his
great
crested
neck
and
endearing
commendations
of
his
beauty
produced
the
desired
effect
montreal
accepted
me
as
inevitable
and
carried
me
very
wisely
and
well
up
the
island
to
another
of
the
slave
settlements
on
the
plantation
called
jones
creek
on
my
way
i
passed
some
magnificent
evergreen
oaks
and
some
thickets
of
exquisite
evergreen
shrubs
and
one
or
two
beautiful
sites
for
a
residence
which
made
me
gnash
my
teeth
when
i
thought
of
the
one
we
have
chosen
to
be
sure
these
charming
spots
instead
of
being
conveniently
in
the
middle
of
the
plantation
are
at
an
out
of
the
way
end
of
it
and
so
hardly
eligible
for
the
one
quality
desired
for
the
overseer
abode
viz
being
central
footnote
the
only
ilex
trees
which
i
have
seen
comparable
in
size
and
beauty
with
those
of
the
of
georgia
are
some
to
be
found
in
the
roman
campagna
at
passerano
lunghegna
castel
fusano
and
other
of
its
great
princely
farms
but
especially
in
the
magnificent
woody
wilderness
of
valerano
all
the
slaves
huts
on
simon
are
far
less
solid
comfortable
and
habitable
than
those
at
the
i
do
not
know
whether
the
labourer
habitation
bespeaks
the
alteration
in
the
present
relative
importance
of
the
crops
but
certainly
the
cultivators
of
the
once
long
staple
cotton
of
simon
are
far
more
miserably
housed
than
the
of
the
other
plantation
these
ruinous
shielings
that
hardly
keep
out
wind
or
weather
are
deplorable
homes
for
young
or
aged
people
and
poor
shelters
for
the
hardworking
men
and
women
who
cultivate
the
fields
in
which
they
stand
riding
home
i
passed
some
beautiful
woodland
with
charming
pink
and
white
blossoming
peach
and
which
seemed
to
belong
to
some
orchard
that
had
been
attempted
and
afterwards
delivered
over
to
wildness
on
enquiry
i
found
that
no
fruit
worth
eating
was
ever
gathered
from
them
what
a
pity
it
seems
for
in
this
warm
delicious
winter
climate
any
and
every
species
of
fruit
might
be
cultivated
with
little
pains
and
to
great
perfection
as
i
was
cantering
along
the
side
of
one
of
the
cotton
fields
i
suddenly
heard
some
inarticulate
vehement
cries
and
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
heap
of
black
limbs
tumbling
and
leaping
towards
me
renewing
the
screams
at
intervals
as
it
approached
i
stopped
my
horse
and
the
black
ball
bounded
almost
into
the
road
before
me
and
suddenly
straightening
itself
up
into
a
haggard
hag
of
a
negress
exclaimed
with
panting
eager
breathlessness
missis
missis
you
no
hear
me
cry
you
no
hear
me
call
oh
missis
me
call
me
cry
and
me
run
make
me
a
gown
like
dat
do
for
massy
sake
only
make
me
a
gown
like
dat
this
modest
request
for
a
riding
habit
in
which
to
hoe
the
cotton
fields
served
for
an
introduction
to
sundry
other
petitions
for
rice
and
sugar
and
flannel
all
which
i
promised
the
petitioner
but
not
the
like
dat
whereupon
i
rode
off
and
she
flung
herself
down
in
the
middle
of
the
road
to
get
her
wind
and
rest
the
passion
for
dress
is
curiously
strong
in
these
people
and
seems
as
though
it
might
be
made
an
instrument
in
converting
them
outwardly
at
any
rate
to
something
like
civilisation
for
though
their
own
native
taste
is
decidedly
both
barbarous
and
ludicrous
it
is
astonishing
how
very
soon
they
mitigate
it
in
imitation
of
their
white
models
the
fine
figures
of
the
mulatto
women
in
charleston
and
savannah
are
frequently
as
elegantly
and
tastefully
dressed
as
those
of
any
of
their
female
superiors
and
here
on
simon
owing
i
suppose
to
the
influence
of
the
resident
lady
proprietors
of
the
various
plantations
and
the
propensity
to
imitation
in
their
black
dependents
the
people
that
i
see
all
seem
to
me
much
tidier
cleaner
and
less
fantastically
dressed
than
those
on
the
rice
plantation
where
no
such
influences
reach
them
on
my
return
from
my
ride
i
had
a
visit
from
captain
f
the
manager
of
a
neighbouring
plantation
with
whom
i
had
a
long
conversation
about
the
present
and
past
condition
of
the
estate
the
species
of
feudal
magnificence
in
which
its
original
owner
major
lived
the
iron
rule
of
old
overseer
k
which
succeeded
to
it
and
the
subsequent
sovereignty
of
his
son
r
k
the
man
for
whom
entertains
such
a
cordial
esteem
and
of
whom
every
account
i
receive
from
the
negroes
seems
to
me
to
indicate
a
merciless
sternness
of
disposition
that
may
be
a
virtue
in
a
but
is
hardly
a
christian
grace
captain
f
was
one
of
our
earliest
visitors
at
the
rice
plantation
on
our
arrival
and
i
think
i
told
you
of
his
mentioning
in
speaking
to
me
of
the
orange
trees
which
formerly
grew
all
round
the
dykes
there
that
he
had
taken
basil
hall
there
once
in
their
blossoming
season
and
that
he
had
said
the
sight
was
as
well
worth
crossing
the
atlantic
for
as
niagara
he
referred
to
that
again
he
has
resided
for
a
great
many
years
on
a
plantation
here
and
is
connected
with
our
neighbour
old
c
whose
daughter
i
believe
he
married
he
interested
me
extremely
by
his
description
of
the
house
major
had
many
years
ago
on
a
part
of
the
island
called
clair
as
far
as
i
can
understand
there
must
have
been
an
indefinite
number
of
residences
on
this
estate
in
the
old
major
time
for
what
with
the
one
we
are
building
and
the
ruined
remains
of
those
not
quite
improved
off
the
face
of
the
earth
and
the
tradition
of
those
that
have
ceased
to
exist
even
as
ruins
i
make
out
no
fewer
than
seven
how
gladly
would
i
exchange
all
that
remain
and
all
that
do
not
for
the
smallest
tenement
in
your
blessed
yankee
mountain
village
captain
f
told
me
that
at
clair
general
oglethorpe
the
good
and
brave
english
governor
of
the
state
of
georgia
in
its
colonial
days
had
his
residence
and
that
among
the
magnificent
live
oaks
which
surround
the
site
of
the
former
settlement
there
was
one
especially
venerable
and
picturesque
which
in
his
recollection
always
went
by
the
name
of
general
oglethorpe
oak
if
you
remember
the
history
of
the
colony
under
his
benevolent
rule
you
must
recollect
how
absolutely
he
and
his
friend
and
counsellor
wesley
opposed
the
introduction
of
slavery
in
the
colony
how
wrathfully
the
old
soldier
spirit
ought
to
haunt
these
cotton
fields
and
rice
swamps
of
his
old
domain
with
their
population
of
wretched
slaves
i
will
ride
to
clair
and
see
his
oak
if
i
should
see
him
he
can
not
have
much
to
say
to
me
on
the
subject
that
i
should
not
cry
amen
to
march
i
have
made
a
gain
no
doubt
in
one
respect
in
coming
here
dear
e
for
not
being
afraid
of
a
rearing
stallion
i
can
ride
but
on
the
other
hand
my
aquatic
diversions
are
all
likely
i
fear
to
be
much
curtailed
well
may
you
or
any
other
northern
abolitionist
consider
this
a
region
why
i
can
not
even
get
worms
to
fish
with
and
was
solemnly
assured
by
jack
this
morning
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
of
the
house
had
been
searched
in
vain
for
these
useful
and
agreeable
animals
i
must
take
to
some
more
species
of
bait
but
in
my
total
ignorance
of
even
the
kind
of
fish
that
inhabit
these
waters
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
adapt
my
temptations
to
their
taste
yesterday
evening
i
had
a
visit
that
made
me
very
sorrowful
if
anything
connected
with
these
poor
people
can
be
called
more
especially
sorrowful
than
their
whole
condition
but
declaration
that
he
will
receive
no
more
statements
of
grievances
or
petitions
for
redress
through
me
makes
me
as
desirous
now
of
shunning
the
vain
appeals
of
these
unfortunates
as
i
used
to
be
of
receiving
and
listening
to
them
the
imploring
cry
missis
that
greets
me
whichever
way
i
turn
makes
me
long
to
stop
my
ears
now
for
what
can
i
say
or
do
any
more
for
them
the
poor
little
favours
the
rice
the
sugar
the
flannel
that
they
beg
for
with
such
eagerness
and
receive
with
such
exuberant
gratitude
i
can
it
is
true
supply
and
words
and
looks
of
pity
and
counsel
of
patience
and
such
instruction
in
womanly
habits
of
decency
and
cleanliness
as
may
enable
them
to
better
in
some
degree
their
own
hard
lot
but
to
the
entreaty
missis
you
speak
to
massa
for
us
oh
missis
you
beg
massa
for
us
oh
missis
you
tell
massa
for
we
he
sure
do
as
you
say
i
can
not
now
answer
as
formerly
and
i
turn
away
choking
and
with
eyes
full
of
tears
from
the
poor
creatures
not
even
daring
to
promise
any
more
the
faithful
transmission
of
their
prayers
the
women
who
visited
me
yesterday
evening
were
all
in
the
and
came
to
entreat
of
me
to
have
the
sentence
what
else
can
i
call
it
modified
which
condemns
them
to
resume
their
labour
of
hoeing
in
the
fields
three
weeks
after
their
confinement
they
knew
of
course
that
i
can
not
interfere
with
their
appointed
labour
and
therefore
their
sole
entreaty
was
that
i
would
use
my
influence
with
to
obtain
for
them
a
month
respite
from
labour
in
the
field
after
their
principal
spokeswoman
a
woman
with
a
bright
sweet
face
called
mary
and
a
very
sweet
voice
which
is
by
no
means
an
uncommon
excellence
among
them
appealed
to
my
own
experience
and
while
she
spoke
of
my
babies
and
my
carefully
tended
delicately
nursed
and
tenderly
watched
confinement
and
convalescence
and
implored
me
to
have
a
kind
of
labour
given
to
them
less
exhausting
during
the
month
after
their
confinement
i
held
the
table
before
me
so
hard
in
order
not
to
cry
that
i
think
my
fingers
ought
to
have
left
a
mark
on
it
at
length
i
told
them
that
had
forbidden
me
to
bring
him
any
more
complaints
from
them
for
that
he
thought
the
ease
with
which
i
received
and
believed
their
stories
only
tended
to
make
them
discontented
and
that
therefore
i
feared
i
could
not
promise
to
take
their
petitions
to
him
but
that
he
would
be
coming
down
to
point
soon
and
that
they
had
better
come
then
some
time
when
i
was
with
him
and
say
what
they
had
just
been
saying
to
me
and
with
this
and
various
small
bounties
i
was
forced
with
a
heavy
heart
to
dismiss
them
and
when
they
were
gone
with
many
exclamations
of
yes
missis
you
will
you
will
speak
to
massa
for
we
god
bless
you
missis
we
sure
you
will
i
had
my
cry
out
for
them
for
myself
for
us
all
these
women
had
had
large
families
and
of
them
had
lost
half
their
children
and
several
of
them
had
lost
more
how
i
do
ponder
upon
the
strange
fate
which
has
brought
me
here
from
so
far
away
from
surroundings
so
curiously
different
how
my
own
people
in
that
blessed
england
of
my
birth
would
marvel
if
they
could
suddenly
have
a
vision
of
me
as
i
sit
here
and
how
sorry
some
of
them
would
be
for
me
i
am
helped
to
bear
all
that
is
so
very
painful
to
me
here
by
my
constant
enjoyment
of
the
strange
wild
scenery
in
the
midst
of
which
i
live
and
which
my
resumption
of
my
equestrian
habits
gives
me
almost
daily
opportunity
of
observing
i
rode
to
some
new
cleared
and
ploughed
ground
that
was
being
prepared
for
the
precious
cotton
crop
i
crossed
a
salt
marsh
upon
a
raised
causeway
that
was
perfectly
alive
with
whose
desperately
active
endeavours
to
avoid
my
horse
hoofs
were
so
ludicrous
that
i
literally
laughed
alone
and
aloud
at
them
the
sides
of
this
road
across
the
swamp
were
covered
with
a
thick
and
close
embroidery
of
creeping
moss
or
rather
lichens
of
the
most
vivid
green
and
red
the
latter
made
my
horse
path
look
as
if
it
was
edged
with
an
exquisite
pattern
of
coral
it
was
like
a
thing
in
a
fairy
tale
and
delighted
me
extremely
i
suppose
e
one
secret
of
my
being
able
to
suffer
as
acutely
as
i
do
without
being
made
either
ill
or
absolutely
miserable
is
the
childish
excitability
of
my
temperament
and
the
sort
of
ecstacy
which
any
beautiful
thing
gives
me
no
day
almost
no
hour
passes
without
some
enjoyment
of
the
sort
this
road
gave
me
which
not
only
charms
my
senses
completely
at
the
time
but
returns
again
and
again
before
my
memory
delighting
my
fancy
and
stimulating
my
imagination
i
sometimes
despise
myself
for
what
seems
to
me
an
inconceivable
rapidity
of
emotion
that
almost
makes
me
doubt
whether
anyone
who
feels
so
many
things
can
really
be
said
to
feel
anything
but
i
generally
recover
from
this
perplexity
by
remembering
whither
invariably
every
impression
of
beauty
leads
my
thoughts
and
console
myself
for
my
contemptible
facility
of
impression
by
the
reflection
that
it
is
upon
the
whole
a
merciful
system
of
compensation
by
which
my
whole
nature
tortured
as
it
was
last
night
can
be
absorbed
this
morning
in
a
perfectly
pleasurable
contemplation
of
the
capers
of
crabs
and
the
colour
of
mosses
as
if
nothing
else
existed
in
creation
one
thing
however
i
think
is
equally
certain
and
that
is
that
i
need
never
expect
much
sympathy
and
perhaps
this
special
endowment
will
make
me
to
some
degree
independent
of
it
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
to
follow
me
through
half
a
day
with
any
species
of
lively
participation
in
my
feelings
would
be
a
severe
breathless
moral
calisthenic
to
most
of
my
friends
what
shakspeare
calls
labour
as
far
as
i
have
hitherto
had
opportunities
of
observing
children
and
maniacs
are
the
only
creatures
who
would
be
capable
of
sufficiently
rapid
transitions
of
thought
and
feeling
to
keep
pace
with
me
and
so
i
rode
through
the
crabs
and
the
coral
there
is
one
thing
however
i
beg
to
commend
to
your
serious
consideration
as
a
trainer
of
youth
and
that
is
the
expediency
of
cultivating
in
all
the
young
minds
you
educate
an
equal
love
of
the
good
the
beautiful
and
the
absurd
not
an
easy
task
for
the
latter
is
apt
in
its
developement
to
interfere
a
little
with
the
two
others
doing
this
you
command
all
the
resources
of
existence
the
love
of
the
good
and
beautiful
of
course
you
are
prepared
to
cultivate
that
goes
without
saying
as
the
french
say
the
love
of
the
ludicrous
will
not
appear
to
you
as
important
and
yet
you
will
be
wrong
to
undervalue
it
in
the
first
place
i
might
tell
you
that
it
was
almost
like
cherishing
the
love
of
at
which
no
doubt
you
shake
your
head
reprovingly
but
leaving
aside
the
enormous
provision
for
the
exercise
of
this
natural
faculty
which
we
offer
to
each
other
why
should
crabs
scuttle
from
under
my
horse
feet
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
me
laugh
again
every
time
i
think
of
it
if
there
is
not
an
inherent
propriety
in
laughter
as
the
only
emotion
which
certain
objects
challenge
an
emotion
wholesome
for
the
soul
and
body
of
man
after
all
are
we
contrived
to
laugh
at
all
if
laughter
is
not
essentially
befitting
and
beneficial
and
most
people
lives
are
too
to
afford
to
lose
one
sparkle
on
them
even
the
smallest
twinkle
of
light
gathered
from
a
flash
of
nonsense
hereafter
point
out
for
the
study
of
your
pupils
all
that
is
absurd
in
themselves
others
and
the
universe
in
general
is
an
element
largely
provided
of
course
to
meet
a
corresponding
and
grateful
capacity
for
its
enjoyment
after
my
crab
and
coral
causeway
i
came
to
the
most
exquisite
thickets
of
evergreen
shrubbery
you
can
imagine
if
i
wanted
to
paint
paradise
i
would
copy
this
undergrowth
passing
through
which
i
went
on
to
the
settlement
at
annie
traversing
another
swamp
on
another
raised
causeway
the
thickets
through
which
i
next
rode
were
perfectly
draped
with
the
beautiful
wild
jasmine
of
these
woods
of
all
the
parasitical
plants
i
ever
saw
i
do
think
it
is
the
most
exquisite
in
form
and
colour
and
its
perfume
is
like
the
most
delicate
heliotrope
i
stopped
for
some
time
before
a
thicket
of
glittering
evergreens
over
which
hung
in
every
direction
streaming
garlands
of
these
fragrant
golden
cups
fit
for
oberon
banqueting
service
these
beautiful
shrubberies
were
resounding
with
the
songs
of
mocking
birds
i
sat
there
on
my
horse
in
a
sort
of
dream
of
enchantment
looking
listening
and
inhaling
the
delicious
atmosphere
of
those
flowers
and
suddenly
my
eyes
opened
as
if
i
had
been
asleep
on
some
bright
red
bunches
of
spring
leaves
on
one
of
the
trees
and
i
as
suddenly
thought
of
the
cold
northern
skies
and
earth
where
the
winter
was
still
inflexibly
tyrannising
over
you
all
and
in
spite
of
the
loveliness
of
all
that
was
present
and
the
harshness
of
all
that
i
seemed
to
see
at
that
moment
no
first
tokens
of
the
spring
return
were
ever
more
welcome
to
me
than
those
bright
leaves
that
reminded
me
how
soon
i
should
leave
this
scene
of
material
beauty
and
moral
degradation
where
the
beauty
itself
is
of
an
appropriate
character
to
the
human
existence
it
surrounds
above
all
loveliness
brightness
and
fragrance
but
below
it
gives
one
a
sort
of
melusina
feeling
of
horror
all
swamp
and
poisonous
stagnation
which
the
heat
will
presently
make
alive
with
venomous
reptiles
i
rode
on
and
the
next
object
that
attracted
my
attention
was
a
very
startling
and
by
no
means
agreeable
one
an
enormous
cypress
tree
which
had
been
burnt
stood
charred
and
blackened
and
leaning
towards
the
road
so
as
to
threaten
a
speedy
fall
across
it
and
on
one
of
the
limbs
of
this
great
charcoal
giant
hung
a
dead
rattlesnake
if
i
tell
you
that
it
looked
to
me
at
least
six
feet
long
you
will
say
you
only
wonder
i
did
not
say
twelve
it
was
a
creature
and
some
negroes
i
met
soon
after
told
me
they
had
found
it
in
the
swamp
and
hung
it
dead
on
the
burning
tree
certainly
the
two
together
made
a
dreadful
trophy
and
a
curious
contrast
to
the
lovely
bowers
of
bloom
i
had
just
been
contemplating
with
such
delight
this
settlement
at
annie
is
the
remotest
on
the
whole
plantation
and
i
found
there
the
wretchedest
huts
and
most
miserably
squalid
filthy
and
forlorn
creatures
i
had
yet
seen
here
certainly
the
condition
of
the
slaves
on
this
estate
is
infinitely
more
neglected
and
deplorable
than
that
on
the
rice
plantation
perhaps
it
may
be
that
the
extremely
unhealthy
nature
of
the
rice
cultivation
makes
it
absolutely
necessary
that
the
physical
condition
of
the
labourers
should
be
maintained
at
its
best
to
enable
them
to
abide
it
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
even
the
process
of
soaking
the
rice
can
hardly
create
a
more
dangerous
miasma
than
the
poor
creatures
must
inhale
who
live
in
the
midst
of
these
sweltering
swamps
half
sea
half
river
slime
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
climate
on
simon
is
generally
considered
peculiarly
mild
and
favourable
and
so
less
protection
of
clothes
and
shelter
is
thought
necessary
here
for
the
poor
residents
perhaps
too
it
may
be
because
the
cotton
crop
is
now
i
believe
hardly
as
valuable
as
the
rice
crop
and
the
plantation
here
which
was
once
the
chief
source
of
its
owner
wealth
is
becoming
a
secondary
one
and
so
not
worth
so
much
care
or
expense
in
repairing
and
constructing
negro
huts
and
feeding
and
clothing
the
slaves
more
pitiable
objects
than
some
of
those
i
saw
at
the
annie
settlement
i
hope
never
to
see
there
was
an
old
crone
called
hannah
a
sister
as
well
as
i
could
understand
what
she
said
of
old
house
molly
whose
face
and
figure
seamed
with
wrinkles
and
bowed
and
twisted
with
age
and
infirmity
really
hardly
retained
the
semblance
of
those
of
a
human
creature
and
as
she
crawled
to
me
almost
half
her
naked
body
was
exposed
through
the
miserable
tatters
that
she
held
on
with
one
hand
while
the
other
eagerly
clutched
my
hand
and
her
poor
blear
eyes
wandered
all
over
me
as
if
she
was
bewildered
by
the
strange
aspect
of
any
human
being
but
those
whose
sight
was
familiar
to
her
one
or
two
forlorn
creatures
like
herself
too
old
or
too
infirm
to
be
compelled
to
work
and
the
and
more
than
children
apparently
left
here
under
their
charge
were
the
only
inmates
i
found
in
these
wretched
hovels
i
came
home
without
stopping
to
look
at
anything
for
i
had
no
heart
any
longer
for
what
had
so
charmed
me
on
my
way
to
this
place
galloping
along
the
road
after
leaving
the
marshes
i
scared
an
ox
who
was
feeding
leisurely
and
to
my
great
dismay
saw
the
foolish
beast
betake
himself
with
lumbering
speed
into
the
the
slaves
will
have
to
hunt
after
him
and
perhaps
will
discover
more
rattlesnakes
six
or
twelve
feet
long
after
reaching
home
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
overseer
to
see
his
wife
a
tidy
decent
little
woman
who
seems
to
me
to
do
her
duty
by
the
poor
people
she
lives
among
as
well
as
her
limited
intelligence
and
still
more
limited
freedom
allow
the
house
her
husband
lives
in
is
the
former
residence
of
major
which
was
the
great
mansion
of
the
estate
it
is
now
in
a
most
ruinous
and
tottering
condition
and
they
inhabit
but
a
few
rooms
in
it
the
others
are
gradually
mouldering
to
pieces
and
the
whole
edifice
will
i
should
think
hardly
stand
long
enough
to
be
carried
away
by
the
river
which
in
its
yearly
inroads
on
the
bank
on
which
it
stands
has
already
approached
within
a
perilous
proximity
to
the
old
dilapidated
planter
palace
old
molly
of
whom
i
have
often
before
spoken
to
you
who
lived
here
in
the
days
of
the
prosperity
and
grandeur
of
still
clings
to
the
relics
of
her
old
former
magnificence
and
with
a
pride
worthy
of
old
caleb
of
ravenswood
showed
me
through
the
dismantled
decaying
rooms
and
over
the
remains
of
the
dairy
displaying
a
capacious
or
well
where
in
the
good
old
days
the
master
supply
was
kept
in
fresh
salt
water
till
required
for
table
her
prideful
lamentations
over
the
departure
of
all
this
quondam
glory
were
ludicrous
and
pathetic
but
while
listening
with
some
amusement
to
the
jumble
of
grotesque
descriptions
through
which
her
impression
of
the
immeasurable
grandeur
and
nobility
of
the
house
she
served
was
the
predominant
feature
i
could
not
help
contrasting
the
present
state
of
the
estate
with
that
which
she
described
and
wondering
why
it
should
have
become
as
it
undoubtedly
must
have
done
so
infinitely
less
productive
a
property
than
in
the
old
major
time
before
closing
this
letter
i
have
a
mind
to
transcribe
to
you
the
entries
for
recorded
in
a
sort
of
daybook
where
i
put
down
very
succinctly
the
number
of
people
who
visit
me
their
petitions
and
ailments
and
also
such
special
particulars
concerning
them
as
seem
to
me
worth
recording
you
will
see
how
miserable
the
physical
condition
of
many
of
these
poor
creatures
is
and
their
physical
condition
it
is
insisted
by
those
who
uphold
this
evil
system
is
the
only
part
of
it
which
is
prosperous
happy
and
compares
well
with
that
of
northern
labourers
judge
from
the
details
i
now
send
you
and
never
forget
while
reading
them
that
the
people
on
this
plantation
are
well
off
and
consider
themselves
well
off
in
comparison
with
the
slaves

some
of
the
neighbouring

a

of
poor
swollen
knees
that
made

ache

have
promised
her
a

of

i
must
forthwith
set

and
was
again
with

she
complained
of
dreadful
pains
in
the
back
and
an
internal
tumour
which
swells
with
the
exertion

is
ruptured

told
me

been
mad

ran
into

elude
discovery

to
escape
again

for
when
she
was
taken
again
she
was
entirely
naked
she
subsequently
recovered
from
this
derangement
and
seems
now
just
like
all
the
other
poor
creatures
who
come
to
me
for
help
and
pity
i
suppose
her
constant
and
hard
labour
in
the
fields
at
the
same
time
may
have
produced
the
temporary
insanity
bush
wife
only
came
to
pay
her
respects
she
had
had
four
miscarriages
had
brought
eleven
children
into
the
world
five
of
whom
are
dead
quambo
wife
also
only
came
to
see
me
hers
was
the
best
account
i
have
yet
received
she
had
had
nine
children
and
six
of
them
were
still
alive
this
is
only
the
entry
for
in
my
diary
of
the
people
complaints
and
visits
can
you
conceive
a
more
wretched
picture
than
that
which
it
exhibits
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
women
live
their
cases
are
in
no
respect
singular
and
though
they
come
with
pitiful
entreaties
that
i
will
help
them
with
some
alleviation
of
their
pressing
physical
distresses
it
seems
to
me
marvellous
with
what
desperate
patience
i
write
it
advisedly
patience
of
utter
despair
they
endure
their
existence
even
the
poor
wretch
who
told
that
miserable
story
of
insanity
and
lonely
hiding
in
the
swamps
and
scourging
when
she
was
found
and
of
her
renewed
madness
and
flight
did
so
in
a
sort
of
low
plaintive
monotonous
murmur
of
misery
as
if
such
sufferings
were
all
the
day
work
i
ask
these
questions
about
their
children
because
i
think
the
number
they
bear
as
compared
with
the
number
they
rear
a
fair
gauge
of
the
effect
of
the
system
on
their
own
health
and
that
of
their
offspring
there
was
hardly
one
of
these
women
as
you
will
see
by
the
details
i
have
noted
of
their
ailments
who
might
not
have
been
a
candidate
for
a
bed
in
an
hospital
and
they
had
come
to
me
after
working
all
day
in
the
fields
dearest
e
when
i
told
you
in
my
last
letter
of
the
encroachments
which
the
waters
of
the
altamaha
are
daily
making
on
the
bank
at
hampton
point
and
immediately
in
front
of
the
old
dwelling
of
the
former
master
i
had
no
idea
how
rapid
this
crumbling
process
has
been
of
late
years
but
standing
there
with
g
whom
i
had
gone
to
consult
about
the
assistance
we
might
render
to
some
of
the
poor
creatures
whose
cases
i
sent
you
in
my
last
letter
she
told
me
that
within
the
memory
of
many
of
the
slaves
now
living
on
the
plantation
a
grove
of
orange
trees
had
spread
its
fragrance
and
beauty
between
the
house
and
the
river
not
a
vestige
remains
of
them
the
earth
that
bore
them
was
gradually
undermined
slipped
and
sank
down
into
the
devouring
flood
and
when
she
saw
the
astonished
incredulity
of
my
look
she
led
me
to
the
ragged
and
broken
bank
and
there
immediately
below
it
and
just
covered
by
the
turbid
waters
of
the
tide
were
the
heads
of
the
poor
drowned
orange
trees
swaying
like
black
twigs
in
the
briny
flood
which
had
not
yet
dislodged
all
of
them
from
their
hold
upon
the
soil
which
had
gone
down
beneath
the
water
wearing
its
garland
of
bridal
blossom
as
i
looked
at
those
trees
a
wild
wish
rose
in
my
heart
that
the
river
and
the
sea
would
swallow
up
and
melt
in
their
salt
waves
the
whole
of
this
accursed
property
of
ours
i
am
afraid
the
horror
of
slavery
with
which
i
came
down
to
the
south
the
general
theoretic
abhorrence
of
an
englishwoman
for
it
has
gained
through
the
intensity
it
has
acquired
a
morbid
character
of
mere
desire
to
be
delivered
from
my
own
share
in
it
i
think
so
much
of
these
wretches
that
i
see
that
i
can
hardly
remember
any
others
and
my
zeal
for
the
general
emancipation
of
the
slave
has
almost
narrowed
itself
to
this
most
painful
desire
that
i
and
mine
were
freed
from
the
responsibility
of
our
share
in
this
huge
misery
and
so
i
thought
beat
the
crumbling
banks
and
sliding
shores
wild
waves
of
the
atlantic
and
the
altamaha
sweep
down
and
carry
hence
this
evil
earth
and
these
homes
of
tyranny
and
roll
above
the
soil
of
slavery
and
wash
my
soul
and
the
souls
of
those
i
love
clean
from
the
blood
of
our
kind
but
i
have
no
idea
that
and
his
brother
would
cry
amen
to
any
such
prayer
sometimes
as
i
stand
and
listen
to
the
roll
of
the
great
ocean
surges
on
the
further
side
of
little
simon
island
a
small
green
screen
of
tangled
wilderness
that
interposes
between
this
point
and
the
atlantic
i
think
how
near
our
west
indian
islands
and
freedom
are
to
these
unfortunate
people
many
of
whom
are
expert
and
hardy
boatmen
as
far
as
the
mere
mechanical
management
of
a
boat
goes
but
unless
providence
were
compass
and
steersman
too
it
avails
nothing
that
they
should
know
how
near
their
freedom
might
be
found
nor
have
i
any
right
to
tell
them
if
they
could
find
it
for
the
slaves
are
not
mine
they
are
the
mulatto
woman
sally
accosted
me
again
and
begged
that
she
might
be
put
to
some
other
than
field
labour
supposing
she
felt
herself
unequal
to
it
i
asked
her
some
questions
but
the
principal
reason
she
urged
for
her
promotion
to
some
less
laborious
kind
of
work
was
that
hoeing
in
the
field
was
so
hard
to
her
on
of
her
and
she
therefore
petitions
to
be
allowed
to
learn
a
trade
i
was
much
puzzled
at
this
reason
for
her
petition
but
was
presently
made
to
understand
that
being
a
mulatto
she
considered
field
labour
a
degradation
her
white
bastardy
appearing
to
her
a
title
to
consideration
in
my
eyes
the
degradation
of
these
people
is
very
complete
for
they
have
accepted
the
contempt
of
their
masters
to
that
degree
that
they
profess
and
really
seem
to
feel
it
for
themselves
and
the
faintest
admixture
of
white
blood
in
their
black
veins
appears
at
once
by
common
consent
of
their
own
race
to
raise
them
in
the
scale
of
humanity
i
had
not
much
sympathy
for
this
petition
the
woman
father
had
been
a
white
man
who
was
employed
for
some
purpose
on
the
estate
in
speaking
upon
this
subject
to
g
she
said
that
as
far
as
her
observation
went
the
lower
class
of
white
men
in
the
south
lived
with
coloured
women
precisely
as
they
would
at
the
north
with
women
of
their
own
race
the
outcry
that
one
hears
against
amalgamation
appears
therefore
to
be
something
educated
and
acquired
rather
than
intuitive
i
can
not
perceive
in
observing
my
children
that
they
exhibit
the
slightest
repugnance
or
dislike
to
these
swarthy
dependents
of
theirs
which
they
surely
would
do
if
as
is
so
often
pretended
there
is
an
inherent
irreconcilable
repulsion
on
the
part
of
the
white
towards
the
negro
race
all
the
southern
children
that
i
have
seen
seem
to
have
a
special
fondness
for
these
childish
human
beings
whose
mental
condition
is
kin
in
its
simplicity
and
proneness
to
impulsive
emotion
to
their
own
and
i
can
detect
in
them
no
trace
of
the
abhorrence
and
contempt
for
their
dusky
skins
which
all
questions
of
treating
them
with
common
justice
is
so
apt
to
elicit
from
american
men
and
women
for
the
first
time
since
i
left
the
rice
island
i
went
out
fishing
but
had
no
manner
of
luck
jack
rowed
me
up
jones
creek
a
small
stream
which
separates
simon
from
the
main
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
great
waters
of
the
altamaha
the
day
was
very
warm
it
is
becoming
almost
too
hot
to
remain
here
much
longer
at
least
for
me
who
dread
and
suffer
from
heat
so
much
the
whole
summer
however
is
passed
by
many
members
of
the
georgia
families
on
their
estates
by
the
sea
when
the
heat
is
intense
the
breeze
from
the
ocean
and
the
salt
air
i
suppose
prevent
it
from
being
intolerable
or
hurtful
our
neighbour
c
and
his
family
reside
entirely
the
year
round
on
their
plantations
here
without
apparently
suffering
in
their
health
from
the
effects
of
the
climate
i
suppose
it
is
the
intermediate
region
between
the
and
the
mountains
that
becomes
so
pestilential
when
once
the
warm
weather
sets
in
i
remember
the
belgian
minister
de
telling
me
that
the
mountain
country
of
georgia
was
as
beautiful
as
paradise
and
that
the
climate
as
far
as
his
experience
went
was
perfectly
delicious
he
was
however
only
there
on
an
exploring
expedition
and
of
course
took
the
most
favourable
season
of
the
year
for
the
purpose
i
have
had
several
women
with
me
this
afternoon
more
or
less
disabled
by
chronic
rheumatism
certainly
either
their
labour
or
the
exposure
it
entails
must
be
very
severe
for
this
climate
is
the
last
that
ought
to
engender
rheumatism
this
evening
i
had
a
visit
from
a
bright
young
woman
calling
herself
minda
who
came
to
beg
for
a
little
rice
or
sugar
i
enquired
from
which
of
the
settlements
she
had
come
down
and
found
that
she
has
to
walk
three
miles
every
day
to
and
from
her
work
she
made
no
complaint
whatever
of
this
and
seemed
to
think
her
laborious
tramp
down
to
the
point
after
her
day
of
labour
on
the
field
by
the
pittance
of
rice
and
sugar
she
obtained
perhaps
she
consoled
herself
for
the
exertion
by
the
reflection
which
occurred
to
me
while
talking
to
her
that
many
women
who
have
borne
children
and
many
women
with
child
go
the
same
distance
to
and
from
their
task
ground
that
seems
dreadful
i
have
let
my
letter
lie
from
a
stress
of
small
interruptions
yesterday
sunday
old
auber
a
stooping
halting
hag
came
to
beg
for
flannel
and
rice
as
usual
of
course
i
asked
various
questions
concerning
her
condition
family
she
told
me
she
had
never
been
married
but
had
had
five
children
two
of
whom
were
dead
she
complained
of
flooding
of
intolerable
and
said
that
with
all
these
ailments
she
considered
herself
quite
recovered
having
suffered
horribly
from
an
abscess
in
her
neck
which
was
now
nearly
well
i
was
surprised
to
hear
of
her
other
complaints
for
she
seemed
to
me
like
quite
an
old
woman
but
constant
and
the
life
of
labour
exposure
and
privation
which
they
lead
ages
these
poor
creatures
prematurely
dear
e
how
i
do
defy
you
to
guess
the
novel
accomplishment
i
have
developed
within
the
last
two
days
what
do
you
say
to
my
turning
butcher
boy
and
cutting
up
the
carcase
of
a
sheep
for
the
instruction
of
our
butcher
and
cook
and
benefit
of
our
table
you
know
i
have
often
written
you
word
that
we
have
mutton
here
thanks
to
the
short
salt
grass
on
which
it
feeds
that
compares
with
the
best
south
down
or
but
such
is
the
barbarous
ignorance
of
the
cook
or
rather
the
butcher
who
furnishes
our
kitchen
supplies
that
i
defy
the
most
expert
anatomist
to
pronounce
on
any
piece
joints
they
can
not
be
called
of
mutton
brought
to
our
table
to
what
part
of
the
animal
sheep
it
originally
belonged
i
have
often
complained
bitterly
of
this
and
in
vain
implored
abraham
the
cook
to
send
me
some
dish
of
mutton
to
which
i
might
with
safety
apply
the
familiar
name
of
leg
shoulder
or
haunch
these
remonstrances
and
expostulations
have
produced
no
result
whatever
however
but
an
increase
of
eccentricity
in
the
of
sheeps
flesh
placed
upon
the
table
the
squares
diamonds
cubes
and
rhomboids
of
mutton
have
been
more
ludicrously
and
hopelessly
unlike
anything
we
see
in
a
christian
shop
with
every
fresh
endeavour
abraham
has
made
to
find
out
wot
de
missis
do
want
so
the
day
before
yesterday
while
i
was
painfully
dragging
s
through
the
early
intellectual
science
of
the
alphabet
and
first
reading
lesson
abraham
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room
brandishing
a
very
long
thin
knife
and
with
many
bows
grins
and
apologies
for
disturbing
me
begged
that
i
would
go
and
cut
up
a
sheep
for
him
my
first
impulse
of
course
was
to
decline
the
very
unusual
task
offered
me
with
mingled
horror
and
amusement
abraham
however
insisted
and
besought
extolled
the
fineness
of
his
sheep
declared
his
misery
at
being
unable
to
cut
it
as
i
wished
and
his
readiness
to
conform
for
the
future
to
whatever
of
mutton
missis
would
only
please
to
give
him
upon
reflection
i
thought
i
might
very
well
contrive
to
indicate
upon
the
sheep
the
size
and
form
of
the
different
joints
of
civilised
mutton
and
so
for
the
future
save
much
waste
of
good
meat
and
moreover
the
lesson
once
taught
would
not
require
to
be
repeated
and
i
have
ever
held
it
expedient
to
accept
every
opportunity
of
learning
to
do
anything
no
matter
how
unusual
which
presented
itself
to
be
done
and
so
i
followed
abraham
to
the
kitchen
when
with
a
towel
closely
pinned
over
my
silk
dress
and
knife
in
hand
i
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
meditating
profoundly
before
the
rather
unsightly
object
which
abraham
had
pronounced
beautifullest
sheep
de
missis
eber
saw
the
sight
and
smell
of
raw
meat
are
especially
odious
to
me
and
i
have
often
thought
that
if
i
had
had
to
be
my
own
cook
i
should
inevitably
become
a
vegetarian
probably
indeed
return
entirely
to
my
green
and
salad
days
nathless
i
screwed
my
courage
to
the
sticking
point
and
slowly
and
delicately
traced
out
with
the
point
of
my
long
two
shoulders
two
legs
a
saddle
and
a
neck
of
mutton
not
probably
in
the
most
thoroughly
artistic
and
butcherly
style
but
as
nearly
as
my
memory
and
the
unassisted
light
of
nature
would
enable
me
and
having
instructed
abraham
in
the
various
boundaries
sizes
shapes
and
names
of
the
several
joints
i
returned
to
s
and
her
rather
elated
upon
the
whole
at
the
creditable
mode
in
which
i
flattered
myself
i
had
accomplished
my
unusual
task
and
the
hope
of
once
more
seeing
roast
mutton
of
my
acquaintance
i
will
confess
to
you
dear
e
that
the
was
not
a
satisfactory
part
of
the
performance
and
i
have
spent
some
thoughts
since
in
trying
to
adjust
in
my
own
mind
its
proper
shape
and
proportions
as
an
accompaniment
to
beautifullest
mutton
de
missis
ever
see
we
have
just
received
from
my
neighbour
c
the
most
magnificent
supply
of
fresh
vegetables
green
peas
salad
he
has
a
garden
and
a
scotchman
real
love
for
horticulture
and
i
profit
by
them
in
this
very
agreeable
manner
i
have
been
interrupted
by
several
visits
my
dear
e
among
other
one
from
a
poor
creature
called
judy
whose
sad
story
and
condition
affected
me
most
painfully
she
had
been
married
she
said
some
years
ago
to
one
of
the
men
called
temba
who
however
now
has
another
wife
having
left
her
because
she
went
mad
while
out
of
her
mind
she
escaped
into
the
jungle
and
contrived
to
secrete
herself
there
for
some
time
but
was
finally
tracked
and
caught
and
brought
back
and
punished
by
being
made
to
sit
day
after
day
for
hours
in
the
stocks
a
severe
punishment
for
a
man
but
for
a
woman
perfectly
barbarous
she
complained
of
chronic
rheumatism
and
other
terrible
ailments
and
said
she
suffered
such
intolerable
pain
while
labouring
in
the
fields
that
she
had
come
to
entreat
me
to
have
her
work
lightened
she
could
hardly
crawl
and
cried
bitterly
all
the
time
she
spoke
to
me
she
told
me
a
miserable
story
of
her
former
experience
on
the
plantation
under
k
overseership
it
seems
that
jem
valiant
an
extremely
difficult
subject
a
mulatto
lad
whose
valour
is
sufficiently
accounted
for
now
by
the
influence
of
the
mutinous
white
blood
was
her
firstborn
the
son
of
k
who
forced
her
flogged
her
severely
for
having
resisted
him
and
then
sent
her
off
as
a
further
punishment
to
five
pound
a
horrible
swamp
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
estate
to
which
the
slaves
are
sometimes
banished
for
such
offences
as
are
not
sufficiently
atoned
for
by
the
lash
the
dismal
loneliness
of
the
place
to
these
poor
people
who
are
as
dependent
as
children
upon
companionship
and
sympathy
makes
this
solitary
exile
a
infliction
and
this
poor
creature
said
that
bad
as
the
flogging
was
she
would
sooner
have
taken
that
again
than
the
dreadful
lonely
days
and
nights
she
spent
on
the
penal
swamp
of
five
pound
i
make
no
comment
on
these
terrible
stories
my
dear
friend
and
tell
them
to
you
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
perfectly
plain
unvarnished
manner
in
which
they
are
told
to
me
i
do
not
wish
to
add
to
or
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
take
away
from
the
effect
of
such
narrations
by
amplifying
the
simple
horror
and
misery
of
their
bare
details
my
dearest
e
i
have
had
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
women
and
children
flowing
in
the
whole
morning
to
say
de
missis
among
others
a
poor
woman
called
mile
who
could
hardly
stand
for
pain
and
swelling
in
her
limbs
she
had
had
fifteen
children
and
two
miscarriages
nine
of
her
children
had
died
for
the
last
three
years
she
had
become
almost
a
cripple
with
chronic
rheumatism
yet
she
is
driven
every
day
to
work
in
the
field
she
held
my
hands
and
stroked
them
in
the
most
appealing
way
while
she
exclaimed
my
missis
my
missis
me
neber
sleep
till
day
for
de
pain
and
with
the
day
her
labour
must
again
be
resumed
i
gave
her
flannel
and
sal
volatile
to
rub
her
poor
swelled
limbs
with
rest
i
could
not
give
her
rest
from
her
labour
and
her
pain
this
mother
of
fifteen
children
another
of
my
visitors
had
a
still
more
dismal
story
to
tell
her
name
was
die
she
had
had
sixteen
children
fourteen
of
whom
were
dead
she
had
had
four
miscarriages
one
had
been
caused
by
falling
down
with
a
very
heavy
burthen
on
her
head
and
one
from
having
her
arms
strained
up
to
be
lashed
i
asked
her
what
she
meant
by
having
her
arms
tied
up
she
said
their
hands
were
first
tied
together
sometimes
by
the
wrists
and
sometimes
which
was
worse
by
the
thumbs
and
they
were
then
drawn
up
to
a
tree
or
post
so
as
almost
to
swing
them
off
the
ground
and
then
their
clothes
rolled
round
their
waist
and
a
man
with
a
stands
and
stripes
them
i
give
you
the
woman
words
she
did
not
speak
of
this
as
of
anything
strange
unusual
or
especially
horrid
and
abominable
and
when
i
said
they
do
that
to
you
when
you
were
with
child
she
simply
replied
missis
and
to
all
this
i
listen
i
an
english
woman
the
wife
of
the
man
who
owns
these
wretches
and
i
can
not
say
thing
shall
not
be
done
again
that
cruel
shame
and
villany
shall
never
be
known
here
again
i
gave
the
woman
meat
and
flannel
which
were
what
she
came
to
ask
for
and
remained
choking
with
indignation
and
grief
long
after
they
had
all
left
me
to
my
most
bitter
thoughts
i
went
out
to
try
and
walk
off
some
of
the
weight
of
horror
and
depression
which
i
am
beginning
to
feel
daily
more
and
more
surrounded
by
all
this
misery
and
degradation
that
i
can
neither
help
nor
hinder
the
blessed
spring
is
coming
very
fast
the
air
is
full
of
delicious
wild
wood
fragrances
and
the
wonderful
songs
of
southern
birds
the
wood
paths
are
as
tempting
as
paths
into
paradise
but
jack
is
in
such
deadly
terror
about
the
snakes
which
are
now
beginning
to
glide
about
with
a
freedom
and
frequency
certainly
not
pleasing
that
he
will
not
follow
me
off
the
open
road
and
twice
scared
me
back
from
charming
wood
paths
i
ventured
to
explore
with
his
exclamations
of
terrified
warning
i
gathered
some
exquisite
pink
blossoms
of
a
sort
of
waxen
texture
off
a
small
shrub
which
was
strange
to
me
and
for
which
jack
only
name
was
but
i
could
not
ascertain
from
him
whether
any
dyeing
substance
was
found
in
its
leaves
bark
or
blossoms
i
returned
home
along
the
river
side
stopping
to
admire
a
line
of
noble
live
oaks
beginning
alas
to
be
smothered
with
the
treacherous
white
moss
under
whose
pale
trailing
masses
their
verdure
gradually
succumbs
leaving
them
like
huge
hoary
ghosts
perfect
mountains
of
parasitical
vegetation
which
strangely
enough
appears
only
to
hang
upon
and
swing
from
their
boughs
without
adhering
to
them
the
mixture
of
these
streams
of
filaments
with
the
dark
foliage
is
extremely
beautiful
as
long
as
the
leaves
of
the
tree
survive
in
sufficient
masses
to
produce
the
rich
contrast
of
colour
but
when
the
moss
has
literally
conquered
the
whole
tree
and
after
stripping
its
huge
limbs
bare
clothed
them
with
its
own
wan
masses
they
always
looked
to
me
like
so
many
gigantic
druid
ghosts
with
flowing
robes
and
beards
and
locks
all
of
one
ghastly
grey
and
i
would
not
have
broken
a
twig
off
them
for
the
world
lest
a
sad
voice
like
that
which
reproached
dante
should
have
moaned
out
of
it
to
me
non
hai
tu
spirto
di
pietade
alcuno
a
beautiful
mass
of
various
woodland
skirted
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
mingled
in
its
foliage
every
shade
of
green
from
the
pale
stiff
spikes
and
fans
of
the
dwarf
palmetto
to
the
dark
canopy
of
the
magnificent
ilex
bowers
and
brakes
of
the
loveliest
wildness
where
one
dare
not
tread
three
steps
for
fear
what
a
tantalisation
it
is
like
some
wicked
enchantment
dearest
e
i
have
found
growing
along
the
edge
of
the
dreary
enclosure
where
the
slaves
are
buried
such
a
lovely
wild
flower
it
is
a
little
like
the
euphrasia
or
of
the
english
meadows
but
grows
quite
close
to
the
turf
almost
into
it
and
consists
of
clusters
of
tiny
white
flowers
that
look
as
if
they
were
made
of
the
finest
porcelain
i
took
up
a
root
of
it
yesterday
with
a
sort
of
vague
idea
that
i
could
transplant
it
to
the
north
though
i
can
not
say
that
i
should
care
to
transplant
anything
thither
that
could
renew
to
me
the
associations
of
this
place
not
even
the
delicious
wild
flowers
if
i
could
the
woods
here
are
full
of
wild
the
delicate
white
blossoms
of
which
twinkle
among
the
evergreen
copses
and
besides
illuminating
them
with
a
faint
starlight
suggest
to
my
mind
a
possible
liqueur
like
kirsch
which
i
should
think
could
quite
as
well
be
extracted
from
wild
plums
as
wild
cherries
and
the
trees
are
so
numerous
that
there
ought
to
be
quite
a
harvest
from
them
you
may
and
doubtless
have
seen
palmetto
plants
in
northern
green
and
hot
houses
but
you
never
saw
palmetto
roots
and
what
curious
things
they
are
huge
hard
stems
as
thick
as
my
arm
or
thicker
extending
and
ramifying
under
the
ground
in
masses
that
seem
hardly
justified
or
accounted
for
by
the
elegant
light
spiky
fans
of
dusky
green
foliage
with
which
they
fill
the
under
part
of
the
woods
here
they
look
very
tropical
and
picturesque
but
both
in
shape
and
colour
suggest
something
metallic
rather
than
vegetable
the
bronze
green
hue
and
form
of
their
foliage
has
an
arid
hard
character
that
makes
one
think
they
could
be
manufactured
quite
as
well
as
cultivated
at
first
i
was
extremely
delighted
with
the
novelty
of
their
appearance
but
now
i
feel
thirsty
when
i
look
at
them
and
the
same
with
their
kinsfolk
the
yuccas
and
their
intimate
friends
if
not
relations
the
prickly
pears
with
all
of
which
once
strange
growth
i
have
grown
contemptuously
familiar
now
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
what
a
strange
affinity
there
is
between
the
texture
and
colour
of
the
wild
vegetables
of
these
sandy
southern
soils
and
the
texture
and
colour
of
shells
the
prickly
pear
and
especially
the
round
little
cactus
plants
all
covered
with
hairy
spikes
are
curiously
suggestive
of
a
family
of
round
spiked
shells
with
which
you
as
well
as
myself
are
doubtless
familiar
and
though
the
splendid
flame
colour
of
some
cactus
blossoms
never
suggests
any
nature
but
that
of
flowers
i
have
seen
some
of
a
peculiar
shade
of
yellow
pink
that
resembles
the
mingled
tint
on
the
inside
of
some
elaborately
coloured
shell
and
the
pale
white
and
rose
flowers
of
another
kind
have
the
colouring
and
almost
texture
of
shell
much
rather
than
of
any
vegetable
substance
i
walked
out
without
jack
and
in
spite
of
the
terror
of
snakes
with
which
he
has
contrived
slightly
to
inoculate
me
i
did
make
a
short
exploring
journey
into
the
woods
i
wished
to
avoid
a
ploughed
field
to
the
edge
of
which
my
wanderings
had
brought
me
but
my
dash
into
the
woodland
though
unpunished
by
an
encounter
with
snakes
brought
me
only
into
a
marsh
as
full
of
as
an
is
of
ants
and
from
which
i
had
to
retreat
ingloriously
finding
my
way
home
at
last
by
the
beach
i
have
had
as
usual
a
tribe
of
visitors
and
petitioners
ever
since
i
came
home
i
will
give
you
an
account
of
those
cases
which
had
anything
beyond
the
average
of
interest
in
their
details
one
poor
woman
named
molly
came
to
beg
that
i
would
if
possible
get
an
extension
of
their
exemption
from
work
after
the
close
of
her
argument
was
concise
and
forcible
we
hab
um
piccaninny
tree
weeks
in
de
ospital
and
den
right
out
upon
the
hoe
again
we
dat
way
missis
no
and
truly
i
do
not
see
that
they
can
this
poor
creature
had
had
eight
children
and
two
miscarriages
all
her
children
were
dead
but
one
another
of
my
visitors
was
a
divinely
named
but
not
otherwise
divine
venus
it
is
a
favourite
name
among
these
sable
folk
but
of
course
must
have
been
given
originally
in
derision
the
aphrodite
in
question
was
a
convenient
colour
i
should
say
for
these
parts
mulatto
i
could
not
understand
how
she
came
on
this
property
for
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
black
woman
and
the
overseer
of
an
estate
to
which
her
mother
formerly
belonged
and
from
which
i
suppose
she
was
sold
exchanged
or
given
as
the
case
may
be
to
the
owners
of
this
plantation
she
was
terribly
crippled
with
rheumatism
and
came
to
beg
for
some
flannel
she
had
had
eleven
children
five
of
whom
had
died
and
two
miscarriages
as
she
took
her
departure
the
vacant
space
she
left
on
the
other
side
of
my
writing
table
was
immediately
filled
by
another
black
figure
with
a
bowed
back
and
piteous
face
one
of
the
thousand
on
the
estate
where
the
bewildering
redundancy
of
their
name
is
avoided
by
adding
that
of
their
husband
so
when
the
question
who
are
you
was
answered
with
the
usual
genuflexion
and
molly
missis
i
of
course
went
on
with
molly
and
she
went
on
to
refer
herself
to
the
ownership
under
and
heaven
of
one
tony
but
proceeded
to
say
that
he
was
not
her
husband
this
appeal
to
an
element
of
reality
in
the
universally
accepted
fiction
which
passes
here
by
the
title
of
marriage
surprised
me
and
on
asking
her
what
she
meant
she
replied
that
her
real
husband
had
been
sold
from
the
estate
for
repeated
attempts
to
run
away
he
had
made
his
escape
several
times
and
skulked
starving
in
the
woods
and
morasses
but
had
always
been
tracked
and
brought
back
and
flogged
almost
to
death
and
finally
sold
as
an
incorrigible
runaway
what
a
spirit
of
indomitable
energy
the
wretched
man
must
have
had
to
have
tried
so
often
that
hideously
hopeless
attempt
to
fly
i
do
not
write
you
the
poor
woman
jargon
which
was
ludicrous
for
i
can
not
write
you
the
sighs
and
tears
and
piteous
looks
and
gestures
that
made
it
pathetic
of
course
she
did
not
know
whither
or
to
whom
her
husband
had
been
sold
but
in
the
meantime
k
that
merciful
providence
of
the
estate
had
provided
her
with
the
tony
by
whom
she
had
had
nine
children
six
of
whom
were
dead
she
too
had
miscarried
twice
she
came
to
ask
me
for
some
flannel
for
her
legs
which
are
all
swollen
with
constant
rheumatism
and
to
beg
me
to
give
her
something
to
cure
some
bad
sores
and
ulcers
which
seemed
to
me
dreadful
enough
in
their
present
condition
but
which
she
said
break
out
afresh
and
are
twice
as
bad
every
summer
i
have
let
my
letter
lie
since
the
day
before
yesterday
dear
e
having
had
no
leisure
to
finish
it
yesterday
morning
i
rode
out
to
clair
where
there
used
formerly
to
be
another
negro
settlement
and
another
house
of
major
i
had
been
persuaded
to
try
one
of
the
mares
i
had
formerly
told
you
of
and
to
be
sure
a
more
quadruped
and
one
more
worthy
of
a
petruchio
for
a
rider
i
did
never
back
her
temper
was
furious
her
gait
intolerable
her
mouth
the
most
obdurate
that
ever
tugged
against
bit
and
bridle
it
is
not
wise
anywhere
here
it
is
less
wise
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
to
say
de
cette
eau
je
ne
boirai
but
i
i
will
never
ride
that
delightful
creature
miss
kate
again
i
wrote
you
of
my
having
been
to
a
part
of
the
estate
called
clair
where
there
was
formerly
another
residence
of
major
nothing
remains
now
of
it
but
a
ruined
chimney
of
some
of
the
offices
which
is
standing
yet
in
the
middle
of
what
has
become
a
perfect
wilderness
at
the
best
of
times
with
a
large
house
numerous
household
and
paths
and
drives
of
approach
and
the
usual
external
conditions
of
civilisation
about
it
a
residence
here
would
have
been
the
loneliest
that
can
well
be
imagined
now
it
is
the
shaggiest
desert
of
beautiful
wood
that
i
ever
saw
the
magnificent
old
oaks
stand
round
the
place
in
silent
solemn
grandeur
and
among
them
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
by
the
description
captain
f
had
given
me
of
it
the
crumbling
shattered
relic
of
a
tree
called
oglethorpe
oak
that
worthy
valiant
old
governor
had
a
residence
here
himself
in
the
early
days
of
the
colony
when
under
the
influence
of
wesley
he
vainly
made
such
strenuous
efforts
to
keep
aloof
from
his
infant
province
the
sore
curse
of
slavery
i
rode
almost
the
whole
way
through
a
grove
of
perfect
evergreen
i
had
with
me
one
of
the
men
of
the
name
of
hector
who
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
horses
and
so
had
volunteered
to
accompany
me
being
one
of
the
few
negroes
on
the
estate
who
can
sit
a
horse
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
hector
divulged
certain
opinions
relative
to
the
comparative
gentility
of
driving
in
a
carriage
and
the
vulgarity
of
walking
which
sent
me
into
fits
of
laughing
at
which
he
grinned
sympathetically
and
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
but
certainly
without
attaining
the
least
insight
into
what
must
have
appeared
to
him
my
very
unaccountable
and
unreasonable
merriment
among
various
details
of
the
condition
of
the
people
on
the
several
estates
in
the
island
he
told
me
that
a
great
number
of
the
men
on
all
the
different
plantations
had
on
the
neighbouring
estates
as
well
as
on
that
to
which
they
properly
belonged
but
said
i
you
know
that
can
not
be
a
man
has
but
one
lawful
wife
hector
knew
this
he
said
and
yet
seemed
puzzled
himself
and
rather
puzzled
me
to
account
for
the
fact
that
this
extensive
practice
of
bigamy
was
perfectly
well
known
to
the
masters
and
overseers
and
never
in
any
way
found
fault
with
or
interfered
with
perhaps
this
promiscuous
mode
of
keeping
up
the
slave
population
finds
favour
with
the
owners
of
creatures
who
are
valued
in
the
market
at
so
much
per
head
this
was
a
solution
which
occurred
to
me
but
which
i
left
my
trojan
hero
to
discover
by
dint
of
the
profound
pondering
into
which
he
fell
not
far
from
the
house
as
i
was
cantering
home
i
met
s
and
took
her
up
on
the
saddle
before
me
an
operation
which
seemed
to
please
her
better
than
the
vicious
horse
i
was
riding
whose
various
demonstrations
of
dislike
to
the
arrangement
afforded
my
small
equestrian
extreme
delight
and
triumph
my
whole
afternoon
was
spent
in
shifting
my
bed
and
furniture
from
a
room
on
the
to
one
above
in
the
course
of
which
operation
a
brisk
discussion
took
place
between
m
and
my
boy
jack
who
was
nailing
on
the
vallence
of
the
bed
and
whom
i
suddenly
heard
exclaim
in
answer
to
something
she
had
said
den
i
do
tink
so
and
dat
the
speech
of
a
man
whether
um
bond
or
free
a
very
trifling
incident
and
insignificant
speech
and
yet
it
came
back
to
my
ears
very
often
afterward
speech
of
a
whether
bond
or
free
they
might
be
made
conscious
some
of
them
are
evidently
conscious
of
an
inherent
element
of
manhood
superior
to
the
bitter
accident
of
slavery
and
to
which
even
in
their
degraded
condition
they
might
be
made
to
refer
that
vital
which
can
survive
all
external
pressure
of
mere
circumstance
and
give
their
souls
to
that
service
of
god
which
is
perfect
freedom
in
spite
of
the
ignoble
and
cruel
bondage
of
their
bodies
my
new
apartment
is
what
i
should
call
decidedly
airy
the
window
unless
when
styled
by
courtesy
shut
which
means
admitting
of
draught
enough
to
blow
a
candle
out
must
be
wide
open
being
incapable
of
any
intermediate
condition
the
latch
of
the
door
to
speak
the
literal
truth
does
shut
but
it
is
the
only
part
of
it
that
does
that
is
the
latch
and
the
hinges
everywhere
else
its
configuration
is
traced
by
a
distinct
line
of
light
and
air
if
what
old
physic
used
to
say
be
true
that
a
draught
which
will
not
blow
out
a
candle
will
blow
out
a
man
life
a
spanish
proverb
originally
i
believe
my
life
is
threatened
with
extinction
in
almost
every
part
of
this
new
room
of
mine
wherein
moreover
i
now
discover
to
my
dismay
having
transported
every
other
article
of
furniture
to
it
it
is
impossible
to
introduce
the
wardrobe
for
my
clothes
well
our
stay
here
is
drawing
to
a
close
and
therefore
these
small
items
of
discomfort
can
not
afflict
me
much
longer
among
my
visitors
was
a
poor
woman
named
oney
who
told
me
her
husband
had
gone
away
from
her
now
for
four
years
it
seems
he
was
the
property
of
k
and
when
that
gentleman
went
to
on
his
own
account
and
ceased
to
be
the
overseer
of
this
estate
he
carried
her
better
half
who
was
his
chattel
away
with
him
and
she
never
expects
to
see
him
again
after
her
departure
i
had
a
most
curious
visitor
a
young
lad
of
the
name
of
renty
whose
very
decidedly
mulatto
tinge
accounted
i
suppose
for
the
peculiar
disinvoltura
of
his
carriage
and
manner
he
was
evidently
in
his
own
opinion
a
very
superior
creature
and
yet
as
his
conversation
with
me
testified
he
was
conscious
of
some
flaw
in
the
honour
of
his
complexion
is
your
mother
renty
said
i
i
give
you
our
exact
dialogue
frank
wife
i
was
rather
dismayed
at
the
promptness
of
this
reply
and
hesitated
a
little
at
my
next
question
is
your
father
my
sprightly
young
friend
however
answered
without
an
instant
pause
k
here
i
came
to
a
halt
and
willing
to
suggest
some
doubt
to
the
lad
because
for
many
peculiar
reasons
this
statement
seemed
to
me
shocking
i
said
old
mr
k
massa
r
your
mother
tell
you
so
missis
me
ashamed
to
ask
her
c
children
told
me
so
and
i
they
know
it
renty
you
see
did
not
take
falconbridge
view
of
such
matters
and
as
i
was
by
no
means
sorry
to
find
that
he
considered
his
relation
to
k
a
disgrace
to
his
mother
which
is
an
advance
in
moral
perception
not
often
met
with
here
i
said
no
more
upon
the
subject
march
this
morning
old
house
molly
coming
from
g
upon
some
errand
to
me
i
asked
her
if
renty
statement
was
true
she
confirmed
the
whole
story
and
moreover
added
that
this
connection
took
place
after
betty
was
married
to
frank
now
he
you
know
e
is
the
chief
man
at
the
rice
island
second
in
authority
to
o
and
indeed
for
a
considerable
part
of
the
year
absolute
master
and
guardian
during
the
night
of
all
the
people
and
property
at
the
rice
plantation
for
after
the
early
spring
the
white
overseer
himself
is
obliged
to
betake
himself
to
the
mainland
to
sleep
out
of
the
influence
of
the
deadly
malaria
of
the
rice
swamp
and
frank
remains
sole
sovereign
of
the
island
from
sunset
to
sunrise
in
short
during
the
whole
period
of
his
absence
bestowed
the
highest
commendations
upon
his
fidelity
and
intelligence
and
during
the
visit
r
k
paid
us
at
the
island
he
was
emphatic
in
his
praise
of
both
frank
and
his
wife
the
latter
having
as
he
declared
by
way
of
climax
to
his
eulogies
quite
the
principles
of
a
white
woman
perhaps
she
imbibed
them
from
his
excellent
influence
over
her
frank
is
a
serious
sad
very
intelligent
man
i
should
think
he
would
not
relish
having
his
wife
borrowed
from
him
even
by
the
white
gentleman
who
admired
her
principles
so
much
and
it
is
quite
clear
from
poor
renty
speech
about
his
mother
that
by
some
of
these
people
and
if
by
any
then
very
certainly
by
frank
the
disgrace
of
such
an
injury
is
felt
and
appreciated
much
after
the
fashion
of
white
men
this
old
woman
molly
is
a
wonderfully
intelligent
active
energetic
creature
though
considerably
over
seventy
years
old
she
was
talking
to
me
about
her
former
master
major
and
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
the
war
revolution
war
during
which
that
gentleman
having
embraced
the
side
of
the
rebellious
colonies
in
their
struggle
against
england
was
by
no
means
on
a
bed
of
roses
he
bore
king
commission
and
was
a
major
in
the
british
army
but
having
married
a
great
carolina
heiress
and
become
proprietor
of
these
plantations
sided
with
the
country
of
his
adoption
and
not
that
of
his
birth
in
the
war
between
them
and
was
a
special
object
of
animosity
on
that
account
to
the
english
officers
who
attacked
the
of
georgia
and
sent
troops
on
shore
and
up
the
altamaha
to
fetch
off
the
negroes
or
incite
them
to
rise
against
their
owners
british
said
molly
old
massa
run
about
bery
much
in
de
great
revelation
war
he
ran
effectually
however
and
contrived
to
save
both
his
life
and
property
from
the
invader
molly
account
was
full
of
interest
in
spite
of
the
grotesque
lingo
in
which
it
was
delivered
and
which
once
or
twice
nearly
sent
me
into
convulsions
of
laughing
whereupon
she
apologized
with
great
gravity
for
her
mispronunciation
modestly
suggesting
that
were
impossible
to
the
organs
of
speech
of
black
folks
it
is
curious
how
universally
any
theory
no
matter
how
absurd
is
accepted
by
these
people
for
anything
in
which
the
contemptuous
supremacy
of
the
dominant
race
is
admitted
and
their
acquiescence
in
the
theory
of
their
own
incorrigible
baseness
is
so
complete
that
this
more
than
any
other
circumstance
in
their
condition
makes
me
doubtful
of
their
rising
from
it
in
order
to
set
poor
dear
old
molly
notions
straight
with
regard
to
the
negro
incapacity
for
speaking
plain
the
noble
white
words
i
called
s
to
me
and
set
her
talking
and
having
pointed
out
to
molly
how
very
imperfect
her
mode
of
pronouncing
many
words
was
convinced
the
worthy
old
negress
that
want
of
training
and
not
any
absolute
original
impotence
was
the
reason
why
she
disfigured
the
for
which
she
had
such
a
profound
respect
in
this
matter
as
in
every
other
the
slaves
pay
back
to
their
masters
the
evil
of
their
own
dealings
with
usury
though
unintentionally
no
culture
however
slight
simple
or
elementary
is
permitted
to
these
poor
creatures
and
the
utterance
of
many
of
them
is
more
like
what
prospero
describes
caliban
to
have
been
than
the
speech
of
men
and
women
in
a
christian
and
civilised
land
the
children
of
their
owners
brought
up
among
them
acquire
their
negro
mode
of
talking
slavish
speech
surely
it
is
and
it
is
distinctly
perceptible
in
the
utterances
of
all
southerners
particularly
of
the
women
whose
avocations
taking
them
less
from
home
are
less
favourable
to
their
throwing
off
this
ignoble
trick
of
pronunciation
than
the
more
varied
occupation
and
the
more
extended
and
promiscuous
business
relations
of
men
the
yankee
twang
of
the
regular
down
easter
is
not
more
easily
detected
by
any
ear
nice
in
enunciation
and
accent
than
the
thick
negro
speech
of
the
southerners
neither
is
lovely
or
melodious
but
though
the
puritan
snuffle
is
the
harsher
of
the
two
the
slave
of
the
language
is
the
more
ignoble
in
spite
of
the
softer
voices
of
the
pretty
southern
women
who
utter
it
i
rode
out
upon
miss
kate
again
with
jack
for
my
esquire
i
made
various
vain
attempts
to
ride
through
the
woods
following
the
cattle
tracks
they
turned
round
and
round
into
each
other
or
led
out
into
the
sandy
pine
barren
the
eternal
frame
in
which
all
nature
is
set
here
the
inevitable
limit
to
the
prospect
turn
landward
which
way
you
will
the
wood
paths
which
i
followed
between
evergreen
thickets
though
little
satisfactory
in
their
ultimate
result
were
really
more
beautiful
than
the
most
perfect
arrangement
of
artificial
planting
that
i
ever
saw
in
an
english
park
and
i
thought
if
i
could
transplant
the
region
which
i
was
riding
through
bodily
into
the
midst
of
some
great
nobleman
possessions
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
how
beautiful
an
accession
it
would
be
thought
to
them
i
was
particularly
struck
with
the
elegant
growth
of
a
profuse
wild
shrub
i
passed
several
times
the
leaves
of
which
were
pale
green
underneath
and
a
deep
red
varnished
brown
above
i
must
give
you
an
idea
of
the
sort
of
service
one
is
liable
to
obtain
from
one
most
intelligent
and
civilised
servants
hereabouts
and
the
consequent
comfort
and
luxury
of
one
daily
existence
yesterday
aleck
the
youth
who
fulfils
the
duties
of
what
you
call
a
waiter
and
we
in
england
a
footman
gave
me
a
salad
for
dinner
mixed
with
so
large
a
portion
of
the
soil
in
which
it
had
grown
that
i
requested
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
wash
the
lettuce
before
he
brought
it
to
table
m
later
in
the
day
told
me
that
he
had
applied
to
her
very
urgently
for
soap
and
a
brush
missis
wished
de
lettuce
scrubbed
a
fate
from
which
my
second
salad
was
saved
by
her
refusal
of
these
desired
articles
and
further
instructions
upon
the
subject
dearest
e
i
have
been
long
promising
poor
old
house
molly
to
visit
her
in
her
own
cabin
and
so
the
day
before
yesterday
i
walked
round
the
settlement
to
her
dwelling
and
a
most
wretched
hovel
i
found
it
she
has
often
told
me
of
the
special
directions
left
by
her
old
master
for
the
comfort
and
of
her
old
age
and
certainly
his
charge
has
been
but
little
heeded
by
his
heirs
for
the
poor
faithful
old
slave
is
most
miserably
off
in
her
infirm
years
she
made
no
complaint
however
but
seemed
overjoyed
at
my
coming
to
see
her
she
took
me
to
the
hut
of
her
brother
old
jacob
where
the
same
wretched
absence
of
every
decency
and
every
comfort
prevailed
but
neither
of
them
seemed
to
think
the
condition
that
appeared
so
wretched
to
me
one
of
peculiar
hardship
though
former
residence
in
her
master
house
might
reasonably
have
made
her
discontented
with
the
lot
of
absolute
privation
to
which
she
was
now
turned
over
but
for
the
moment
my
visit
seemed
to
compensate
for
all
sublunary
sorrows
and
she
and
poor
old
jacob
kept
up
a
duet
of
rejoicing
at
my
advent
and
that
i
had
brought
little
missis
among
um
people
afore
they
die
leaving
them
i
went
on
to
the
house
of
jacob
daughter
hannah
with
whom
psyche
the
heroine
of
the
rice
island
story
and
wife
of
his
son
joe
lives
i
found
their
cabin
as
tidy
and
comfortable
as
it
could
be
made
and
their
children
as
usual
neat
and
clean
they
are
capital
women
both
of
them
with
an
innate
love
of
cleanliness
and
order
most
uncommon
among
these
people
on
my
way
home
i
overtook
two
of
my
daily
suppliants
who
were
going
to
the
house
in
search
of
me
and
meat
flannel
rice
and
sugar
as
the
case
might
be
they
were
both
old
and
women
and
one
of
them
called
scylla
was
extremely
lame
which
she
accounted
for
by
an
accident
she
had
met
with
while
carrying
a
heavy
weight
of
rice
on
her
head
she
had
fallen
on
a
sharp
stake
or
snag
as
she
called
it
and
had
never
recovered
the
injury
she
had
received
she
complained
also
of
falling
of
the
womb
her
companion
who
was
not
charybdis
however
but
phoebe
was
a
cheery
soul
who
complained
of
nothing
but
begged
for
flannel
i
asked
her
about
her
family
and
children
she
had
no
children
left
nothing
but
grandchildren
she
had
had
nine
children
and
seven
of
them
died
quite
young
the
only
two
who
grew
up
left
her
to
join
the
british
when
they
invaded
georgia
in
the
last
war
and
their
children
whom
they
left
behind
were
all
her
family
now
in
the
afternoon
i
made
my
first
visit
to
the
hospital
of
the
estate
and
found
it
as
indeed
i
find
everything
else
here
in
a
far
worse
state
even
than
the
wretched
establishments
on
the
rice
island
dignified
by
that
name
so
miserable
a
place
for
the
purpose
to
which
it
was
dedicated
i
could
not
have
imagined
on
a
property
belonging
to
christian
owners
the
floor
which
was
not
boarded
but
merely
the
damp
hard
earth
itself
was
strewn
with
wretched
women
who
but
for
their
moans
of
pain
and
uneasy
restless
motions
might
very
well
have
each
been
taken
for
a
mere
heap
of
filthy
rags
the
chimney
refusing
passage
to
the
smoke
from
the
pine
wood
fire
it
puffed
out
in
clouds
through
the
room
where
it
circled
and
hung
only
gradually
oozing
away
through
the
windows
which
were
so
far
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
that
there
was
not
a
single
whole
pane
of
glass
in
them
my
eyes
unaccustomed
to
the
turbid
atmosphere
smarted
and
watered
and
refused
to
distinguish
at
first
the
different
dismal
forms
from
which
cries
and
wails
assailed
me
in
every
corner
of
the
place
by
degrees
i
was
able
to
endure
for
a
few
minutes
what
they
were
condemned
to
live
their
hours
and
days
of
suffering
and
sickness
through
and
having
given
what
comfort
kind
words
and
promises
of
help
in
more
substantial
forms
could
convey
i
went
on
to
what
seemed
a
yet
more
wretched
abode
of
wretchedness
this
was
a
room
where
there
was
no
fire
because
there
was
no
chimney
and
where
the
holes
made
for
windows
had
no
panes
or
glasses
in
them
the
shutters
being
closed
the
place
was
so
dark
that
on
first
entering
it
i
was
afraid
to
stir
lest
i
should
fall
over
some
of
the
deplorable
creatures
extended
upon
the
floor
as
soon
as
they
perceived
me
one
cry
of
missis
rang
through
the
darkness
and
it
really
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
was
never
to
exhaust
the
pity
and
amazement
and
disgust
which
this
receptacle
of
suffering
humanity
was
to
excite
in
me
the
poor
dingy
supplicating
sleepers
upraised
themselves
as
i
cautiously
advanced
among
them
those
who
could
not
rear
their
bodies
from
the
earth
held
up
piteous
beseeching
hands
and
as
i
passed
from
one
to
the
other
i
felt
more
than
one
imploring
clasp
laid
upon
my
dress
to
solicit
my
attention
to
some
new
form
of
misery
one
poor
woman
called
tressa
who
was
unable
to
speak
above
a
whisper
from
utter
weakness
and
exhaustion
told
me
she
had
had
nine
children
was
suffering
from
incessant
flooding
and
felt
if
her
back
would
split
open
there
she
lay
a
mass
of
filthy
tatters
without
so
much
as
a
blanket
under
or
over
her
on
the
bare
earth
in
this
chilly
darkness
i
promised
them
help
and
comfort
beds
and
blankets
and
light
and
fire
that
is
i
promised
to
ask
for
all
this
for
them
and
in
the
very
act
of
doing
so
i
remembered
with
a
sudden
pang
of
anguish
that
i
was
to
urge
no
more
petitions
for
his
slaves
to
their
master
i
groped
my
way
out
and
emerging
on
the
piazza
all
the
choking
tears
and
sobs
i
had
controlled
broke
forth
and
i
leaned
there
crying
over
the
lot
of
these
unfortunates
till
i
heard
a
feeble
voice
of
you
no
cry
missis
what
for
you
cry
and
looking
up
saw
that
i
had
not
yet
done
with
this
intolerable
infliction
a
poor
crippled
old
man
lying
in
the
corner
of
the
piazza
unable
even
to
crawl
towards
me
had
uttered
this
word
of
consolation
and
by
his
side
apparently
too
idiotic
as
he
was
too
impotent
to
move
sat
a
young
woman
the
expression
of
whose
face
was
the
most
suffering
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
horribly
repulsive
i
ever
saw
i
found
she
was
as
i
supposed
and
on
coming
nearer
to
enquire
into
her
ailments
and
what
i
could
do
for
her
found
her
suffering
from
that
horrible
disease
i
believe
some
form
of
scrofula
to
which
the
negroes
are
subject
which
attacks
and
eats
away
the
joints
of
their
hands
and
fingers
a
more
hideous
and
loathsome
object
i
never
beheld
her
name
was
patty
and
she
was
to
the
old
crippled
creature
by
whose
side
she
was
squatting
i
wandered
home
stumbling
with
crying
as
i
went
and
feeling
so
utterly
miserable
that
i
really
hardly
saw
where
i
was
going
for
i
as
nearly
as
possible
fell
over
a
great
heap
of
oyster
shells
left
in
the
middle
of
the
path
this
is
a
horrid
nuisance
which
results
from
an
indulgence
which
the
people
here
have
and
value
highly
the
waters
round
the
island
are
prolific
in
shell
fish
oysters
and
the
most
magnificent
prawns
i
ever
saw
the
former
are
a
considerable
article
of
the
people
diet
and
the
shells
are
allowed
to
accumulate
as
they
are
used
in
the
composition
of
which
their
huts
are
built
and
which
is
a
sort
of
combination
of
mud
and
broken
oyster
shells
which
forms
an
agglomeration
of
a
kind
very
solid
and
durable
for
such
building
purposes
but
instead
of
being
all
carried
to
some
specified
place
out
of
the
way
these
great
heaps
of
oyster
shells
are
allowed
to
be
piled
up
anywhere
and
everywhere
forming
the
most
unsightly
obstructions
in
every
direction
of
course
the
cultivation
of
order
for
the
sake
of
its
own
seemliness
and
beauty
is
not
likely
to
be
an
element
of
slave
existence
and
as
masters
have
been
scarce
on
this
plantation
for
many
years
now
a
mere
unsightliness
is
not
a
matter
likely
to
trouble
anybody
much
but
after
my
imminent
overthrow
by
one
of
these
disorderly
heaps
of
refuse
i
think
i
may
make
bold
to
request
that
the
paths
along
which
i
am
likely
to
take
my
daily
walks
may
be
kept
free
from
them
on
my
arrival
at
home
at
the
house
i
can
not
call
any
place
here
my
home
i
found
renty
waiting
to
exhibit
to
me
an
extremely
neatly
made
leather
pouch
which
he
has
made
by
my
order
of
fitting
size
and
dimensions
to
receive
jack
hatchet
and
saw
jack
and
i
have
set
up
a
sort
of
sir
walter
and
tom
purdie
companionship
of
clearing
and
cutting
paths
through
the
woods
nearest
to
the
house
thinning
the
overhanging
branches
clearing
the
small
evergreen
thickets
which
here
and
there
close
over
and
across
the
grassy
track
to
me
this
occupation
was
especially
delightful
until
quite
lately
since
the
weather
began
to
be
rather
warmer
and
the
snakes
to
slide
about
jack
has
contrived
to
inoculate
me
with
some
portion
of
his
terror
of
them
but
i
have
still
a
daily
hankering
after
the
lovely
green
wood
walks
perhaps
when
once
i
have
seen
a
live
rattlesnake
my
enthusiasm
for
them
will
be
modified
to
the
degree
that
his
is
dear
e
this
letter
has
remained
unfinished
and
my
journal
interrupted
for
more
than
a
week
has
been
quite
unwell
and
i
have
been
travelling
to
and
fro
daily
between
hampton
and
the
rice
island
in
the
long
boat
to
visit
him
for
the
last
three
days
i
have
remained
at
the
latter
place
and
only
returned
here
this
morning
early
my
daily
voyages
up
and
down
the
river
have
introduced
me
to
a
great
variety
of
new
musical
performances
of
our
boatmen
who
invariably
when
the
rowing
is
not
too
hard
moving
up
or
down
with
the
tide
accompany
the
stroke
of
their
oars
with
the
sound
of
their
voices
i
told
you
formerly
that
i
thought
i
could
trace
distinctly
some
popular
national
melody
with
which
i
was
familiar
in
almost
all
their
songs
but
i
have
been
quite
at
a
loss
to
discover
any
such
foundation
for
many
that
i
have
heard
lately
and
which
have
appeared
to
me
extraordinarily
wild
and
unaccountable
the
way
in
which
the
chorus
strikes
in
with
the
burthen
between
each
phrase
of
the
melody
chanted
by
a
single
voice
is
very
curious
and
effective
especially
with
the
rhythm
of
the
rowlocks
for
accompaniment
the
high
voices
all
in
unison
and
the
admirable
time
and
true
accent
with
which
their
responses
are
made
always
make
me
wish
that
some
great
musical
composer
could
hear
these
performances
with
a
very
little
skilful
adaptation
and
instrumentation
i
think
one
or
two
barbaric
chants
and
choruses
might
be
evoked
from
them
that
would
make
the
fortune
of
an
opera
the
only
exception
that
i
have
met
with
yet
among
our
boat
voices
to
the
high
tenor
which
they
seem
all
to
possess
is
in
the
person
of
an
individual
named
isaac
a
basso
profondo
of
the
deepest
dye
who
nevertheless
never
attempts
to
produce
with
his
different
register
any
different
effects
in
the
chorus
by
venturing
a
second
but
sings
like
the
rest
in
unison
perfect
unison
of
both
time
and
tune
this
individual
speak
and
therefore
i
presume
he
is
not
an
ape
chimpanzee
or
gorilla
but
i
could
not
i
confess
have
conceived
it
possible
that
the
presence
of
articulate
sounds
and
the
absence
of
an
articulate
tail
should
make
externally
at
least
so
completely
the
only
appreciable
difference
between
a
man
and
a
monkey
as
they
appear
to
do
in
this
individual
brother
such
stupendous
long
thin
hands
and
long
flat
feet
i
did
never
see
off
a
large
quadruped
of
the
ape
species
but
as
i
said
before
isaac
and
i
am
much
comforted
thereby
you
can
not
think
to
return
to
the
songs
of
my
boatmen
how
strange
some
of
their
words
are
in
one
they
repeatedly
chanted
the
that
made
man
and
man
makes
what
do
you
think
is
not
that
a
peculiar
poetical
proposition
another
ditty
to
which
they
frequently
treat
me
they
call
caesar
song
it
is
an
extremely
spirited
beginning
trumpets
blow
the
bugles
sound
oh
stand
your
ground
it
has
puzzled
me
not
a
little
to
determine
in
my
own
mind
whether
this
title
of
caesar
song
has
any
reference
to
the
great
julius
and
if
so
what
may
be
the
negro
notion
of
him
and
whence
and
how
derived
one
of
their
songs
displeased
me
not
a
little
for
it
embodied
the
opinion
that
black
girls
not
make
mulatto
yellow
girl
and
as
i
told
them
i
did
not
like
it
they
have
omitted
it
since
this
desperate
tendency
to
despise
and
undervalue
their
own
race
and
colour
which
is
one
of
the
very
worst
results
of
their
abject
condition
is
intolerable
to
me
while
rowing
up
and
down
the
broad
waters
of
the
altamaha
to
the
music
of
these
curious
chants
i
have
been
reading
moore
speech
about
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
confess
i
think
his
the
only
defensible
position
yet
taken
and
the
only
consistent
argument
yet
used
in
any
of
the
speeches
i
have
hitherto
seen
upon
the
subject
i
have
now
settled
down
at
hampton
again
is
quite
recovered
and
is
coming
down
here
in
a
day
or
two
for
change
of
air
it
is
getting
too
late
for
him
to
stay
on
the
rice
plantation
even
in
the
day
i
think
you
can
not
imagine
anything
so
exquisite
as
the
perfect
curtains
of
yellow
jasmine
with
which
this
whole
island
is
draped
and
as
the
boat
comes
sweeping
down
towards
the
point
the
fragrance
from
the
thickets
hung
with
their
golden
garlands
greets
one
before
one
can
distinguish
them
it
is
really
enchanting
i
have
now
to
tell
you
of
my
hallowing
last
sunday
by
gathering
a
congregation
of
the
people
into
my
big
and
reading
prayers
to
them
i
had
been
wishing
very
much
to
do
this
for
some
time
past
and
obtained
leave
while
i
was
with
him
at
the
rice
island
and
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
me
some
of
the
people
are
allowed
to
go
up
to
darien
once
a
month
to
church
but
with
that
exception
they
have
no
religious
service
on
sunday
whatever
for
them
there
is
a
church
on
the
island
of
simon
but
they
are
forbidden
to
frequent
it
as
it
leads
them
off
their
own
through
neighbouring
plantations
and
gives
opportunities
for
meetings
between
the
negroes
of
the
different
estates
and
very
likely
was
made
the
occasion
of
abuses
and
objectionable
practices
of
various
kinds
at
any
rate
k
forbade
the
hampton
slaves
resorting
to
the
simon
church
and
so
for
three
sundays
in
the
month
they
are
utterly
without
christian
worship
or
teaching
or
any
religious
observance
of
god
day
whatever
i
was
very
anxious
that
it
should
not
be
thought
that
i
any
of
the
people
to
come
to
prayers
as
i
particularly
desired
to
see
if
they
themselves
felt
the
want
of
any
sabbath
service
and
would
of
their
own
accord
join
in
any
such
ceremony
i
therefore
merely
told
the
house
servants
that
if
they
would
come
to
the
at
eleven
i
would
read
prayers
to
them
and
that
they
might
tell
any
of
their
friends
or
any
of
the
people
that
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
them
if
they
liked
to
come
accordingly
most
of
those
who
live
at
the
point
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
house
came
and
it
was
encouraging
to
see
the
very
decided
efforts
at
cleanliness
and
decorum
of
attire
which
they
had
all
made
i
was
very
much
affected
and
impressed
myself
by
what
i
was
doing
and
i
suppose
must
have
communicated
some
of
my
own
feeling
to
those
who
heard
me
it
is
an
extremely
solemn
thing
to
me
to
read
the
scriptures
aloud
to
any
one
and
there
was
something
in
my
relation
to
the
poor
people
by
whom
i
was
surrounded
that
touched
me
so
deeply
while
thus
attempting
to
share
with
them
the
best
of
my
possessions
that
i
found
it
difficult
to
command
my
voice
and
had
to
stop
several
times
in
order
to
do
so
when
i
had
done
they
all
with
one
accord
uttered
the
simple
words
thank
you
missis
and
instead
of
overwhelming
me
as
usual
with
petitions
and
complaints
they
rose
silently
and
quietly
in
a
manner
that
would
have
become
the
most
orderly
of
christian
congregations
accustomed
to
all
the
impressive
decorum
of
civilised
church
privileges
poor
people
they
are
said
to
have
what
a
very
irreligious
young
english
clergyman
once
informed
me
i
had
a
for
religion
they
seem
to
me
to
have
a
for
instinctive
good
manners
too
and
certainly
their
mode
of
withdrawing
from
my
room
after
our
prayers
bespoke
either
a
strong
feeling
of
their
own
or
a
keen
appreciation
of
mine
i
have
resumed
my
explorations
in
the
woods
with
renewed
enthusiasm
for
during
my
week
absence
they
have
become
more
lovely
and
enticing
than
ever
unluckily
however
jack
seems
to
think
that
fresh
rattlesnakes
have
budded
together
with
the
tender
spring
foliage
and
i
see
that
i
shall
either
have
to
give
up
my
wood
walks
and
rides
or
go
without
a
guide
lovely
blossoms
are
springing
up
everywhere
weeds
of
course
wild
things
impertinently
so
called
nothing
is
cultivated
here
but
cotton
but
in
some
of
the
cotton
fields
beautiful
creatures
are
peeping
into
blossom
which
i
suppose
will
all
be
duly
hoed
off
the
surface
of
the
soil
in
proper
season
meantime
i
rejoice
in
them
and
in
the
splendid
magnificent
thistles
which
would
be
in
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
in
the
wonderful
strange
beautiful
butterflies
that
seem
to
me
almost
as
big
as
birds
that
go
in
the
sun
i
saw
yesterday
a
lovely
monster
who
thought
proper
for
my
greater
delectation
to
alight
on
a
thistle
i
was
admiring
and
as
the
flower
was
purple
and
he
was
all
black
velvet
fringed
with
gold
i
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
his
good
inspiration
this
morning
i
drove
up
to
the
settlement
at
annie
having
various
bundles
of
benefaction
to
carry
in
the
only
equipage
my
estate
here
affords
an
exceedingly
small
rough
and
uncomfortable
cart
called
the
sick
house
waggon
inasmuch
as
it
is
used
to
convey
to
the
hospital
such
of
the
poor
people
as
are
too
ill
to
walk
there
its
tender
mercies
must
be
terrible
indeed
for
the
sick
for
i
who
am
sound
could
very
hardly
abide
them
however
i
suppose
montreal
pace
is
moderated
for
them
he
went
rollicking
along
with
us
behind
him
shaking
his
fine
head
and
mane
as
if
he
thought
the
more
we
were
jolted
the
better
we
should
like
it
we
found
on
trying
to
go
on
to
cartwright
point
that
the
state
of
the
tide
would
not
admit
of
our
getting
thither
and
so
had
to
return
leaving
it
unvisited
it
seems
to
me
strange
that
where
the
labour
of
so
many
hands
might
be
commanded
piers
and
wharves
and
causeways
are
not
thrown
out
wooden
ones
of
course
i
mean
wherever
the
common
traffic
to
or
from
different
parts
of
the
plantation
is
thus
impeded
by
the
daily
rise
and
fall
of
the
river
the
trouble
and
expense
would
be
nothing
and
the
gain
in
convenience
very
considerable
however
perhaps
the
nature
of
the
tides
and
of
the
banks
and
shores
themselves
may
not
be
propitious
for
such
constructions
and
i
rather
incline
upon
reflection
to
think
this
may
be
so
because
to
go
from
hampton
to
our
neighbour
c
plantation
it
is
necessary
to
consult
the
tide
in
order
to
land
conveniently
driving
home
by
jones
creek
we
saw
an
immovable
row
of
white
cranes
all
standing
with
imperturbable
gravity
upon
one
leg
i
thought
of
boccaccio
cook
and
had
a
mind
to
say
ha
at
them
to
try
if
they
had
two
i
have
been
over
to
c
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
my
visit
but
will
tell
you
of
it
in
my
next
dear
e
i
promised
to
tell
you
of
my
visit
to
my
neighbour
c
which
pleased
and
interested
me
very
much
he
is
an
old
glasgow
man
who
has
been
settled
here
many
years
it
is
curious
how
many
of
the
people
round
this
neighbourhood
have
scotch
names
it
seems
strange
to
find
them
thus
gathered
in
the
vicinity
of
a
new
darien
but
those
in
our
immediate
neighbourhood
seem
to
have
found
it
a
far
less
fatal
region
than
their
countrymen
did
its
namesake
of
the
isthmus
c
house
is
a
roomy
comfortable
handsomely
laid
out
mansion
to
which
he
received
me
with
very
cordial
kindness
and
where
i
spent
part
of
a
very
pleasant
morning
talking
with
him
hearing
all
he
could
tell
me
of
the
former
history
of
plantation
his
description
of
its
former
master
old
major
and
of
his
agent
and
overseer
k
and
of
that
gentleman
worthy
son
and
successor
the
late
overseer
interested
me
very
much
of
the
two
latter
functionaries
his
account
was
terrible
and
much
what
i
had
supposed
any
impartial
account
of
them
would
be
because
let
the
propensity
to
lying
of
the
poor
wretched
slaves
be
what
it
will
they
could
not
invent
with
a
common
consent
the
things
that
they
one
and
all
tell
me
with
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
treated
by
the
man
who
has
just
left
the
estate
and
his
father
who
for
the
last
nineteen
years
have
been
sole
sovereigns
of
their
bodies
and
souls
the
crops
have
satisfied
the
demands
of
the
owners
who
living
in
philadelphia
have
been
perfectly
contented
to
receive
a
large
income
from
their
estate
without
apparently
caring
how
it
was
earned
the
stories
that
the
poor
people
tell
me
of
the
cruel
tyranny
under
which
they
have
lived
are
not
complaints
for
they
are
of
things
past
and
gone
and
very
often
horridly
as
they
shock
and
affect
me
they
themselves
seem
hardly
more
than
half
conscious
of
the
misery
their
condition
exhibits
to
me
and
they
speak
of
things
which
i
shudder
to
hear
of
almost
as
if
they
had
been
matters
of
course
with
them
old
c
spoke
with
extreme
kindness
of
his
own
people
and
had
evidently
bestowed
much
humane
and
benevolent
pains
upon
endeavours
to
better
their
condition
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
the
soil
and
climate
of
this
part
of
georgia
admirably
suited
to
the
cultivation
of
the
mulberry
and
the
rearing
of
the
for
it
has
appeared
to
me
that
hereafter
silk
may
be
made
one
of
the
most
profitable
products
of
this
whole
region
he
said
that
that
had
long
been
his
opinion
and
he
had
at
one
time
had
it
much
at
heart
to
try
the
experiment
and
had
proposed
to
major
to
join
him
in
it
on
a
scale
large
enough
to
test
it
satisfactorily
but
he
said
k
opposed
the
scheme
so
persistently
that
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
carry
it
out
as
his
agency
and
cooperation
were
indispensable
and
that
in
like
manner
he
had
suggested
sowing
turnip
crops
and
planting
peach
trees
for
the
benefit
and
use
of
the
people
on
the
hampton
estate
experiments
which
he
had
tried
with
excellent
success
on
his
own
but
all
these
plans
for
the
amelioration
and
progress
of
the
people
physical
condition
had
been
obstructed
and
finally
put
entirely
aside
by
old
k
and
his
son
who
as
c
said
appeared
to
give
satisfaction
to
their
employers
so
it
was
not
his
business
to
find
fault
with
them
he
said
however
that
the
whole
condition
and
treatment
of
the
slaves
had
changed
from
the
time
of
major
death
and
that
he
thought
it
providential
for
the
poor
people
that
k
should
have
left
the
estate
and
the
young
gentleman
the
present
owner
come
down
to
look
after
the
people
he
showed
me
his
garden
from
whence
come
the
beautiful
vegetables
he
had
more
than
once
supplied
me
with
in
the
midst
of
it
was
a
very
fine
and
flourishing
date
palm
tree
which
he
said
bore
its
fruit
as
prosperously
here
as
it
would
in
asia
after
the
garden
we
visited
a
charming
poultry
yard
and
i
returned
home
much
delighted
with
my
visit
and
the
kind
good
humour
of
my
host
in
the
afternoon
i
sat
as
usual
at
the
receipt
of
custom
hearing
of
aches
and
pains
till
i
ached
myself
sympathetically
from
head
to
foot
yesterday
morning
dear
e
i
went
on
horseback
to
annie
exploring
on
my
way
some
beautiful
woods
and
in
the
afternoon
i
returned
thither
in
a
wood
waggon
with
jack
to
drive
and
a
mule
to
draw
me
montreal
being
quite
beyond
his
management
and
then
and
there
the
hatchet
and
saw
being
in
company
i
compelled
my
slave
jack
all
the
rattlesnakes
in
creation
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
to
cut
and
clear
a
way
for
my
chariot
through
the
charming
copse
my
letter
has
been
lying
unfinished
for
the
last
three
days
i
have
been
extraordinarily
busy
having
emancipated
myself
from
the
trammels
of
jack
and
all
his
terror
and
as
i
fear
no
serpents
on
horseback
have
been
daily
riding
through
new
patches
of
woodland
without
any
guide
taking
my
chance
of
what
i
might
come
to
in
the
shape
of
impediments
last
tuesday
i
rode
through
a
whole
wood
of
burned
and
charred
trees
cypresses
and
oaks
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
each
of
them
blasted
by
a
special
thunderbolt
and
whole
thickets
of
young
trees
and
shrubs
perfectly
black
and
brittle
from
the
effect
of
fire
i
suppose
the
result
of
some
carelessness
of
the
slaves
as
this
charcoal
woodland
extended
for
some
distance
i
turned
out
of
it
and
round
the
main
road
through
the
plantation
as
i
could
not
ride
through
the
blackened
boughs
and
branches
without
getting
begrimed
it
had
a
strange
wild
desolate
effect
not
without
a
certain
gloomy
picturesqueness
in
the
afternoon
i
made
israel
drive
me
through
jack
path
to
break
it
down
and
open
it
still
more
and
montreal
powerful
trampling
did
good
service
to
that
effect
though
he
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
narrow
wood
road
with
its
grass
path
by
any
means
as
much
as
the
open
way
of
what
may
be
called
the
high
road
after
this
operation
i
went
on
to
visit
the
people
at
the
busson
hill
settlement
i
here
found
among
other
noteworthy
individuals
a
female
named
judy
whose
two
children
belong
to
an
individual
called
not
punch
but
joe
who
has
another
wife
called
mary
at
the
rice
island
in
one
of
the
huts
i
went
to
leave
some
flannel
and
rice
and
sugar
for
a
poor
old
creature
called
nancy
to
whom
i
had
promised
such
indulgences
she
is
exceedingly
infirm
and
miserable
suffering
from
sore
limbs
and
an
ulcerated
leg
so
cruelly
that
she
can
hardly
find
rest
in
any
position
from
the
constant
pain
she
endures
and
is
quite
unable
to
lie
on
her
hard
bed
at
night
as
i
bent
over
her
trying
to
prop
her
into
some
posture
where
she
might
find
some
ease
she
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
with
the
tears
streaming
over
her
face
said
have
worked
every
day
through
dew
and
damp
and
sand
and
heat
and
done
good
work
but
oh
missis
me
old
and
broken
now
no
tongue
can
tell
how
much
i
suffer
in
spite
of
their
curious
thick
utterance
and
comical
jargon
these
people
sometimes
use
wonderfully
striking
and
pathetic
forms
of
speech
in
the
next
cabin
which
consisted
of
an
enclosure
called
by
courtesy
a
room
certainly
not
ten
feet
square
and
owned
by
a
woman
called
dice
that
is
not
owned
of
course
but
inhabited
by
her
three
grown
up
human
beings
and
eight
children
stow
themselves
by
day
and
night
which
may
be
called
close
packing
i
think
i
presume
that
they
must
take
turns
to
be
inside
and
outside
the
house
but
they
did
not
make
any
complaint
about
it
though
i
should
think
the
aspect
of
my
countenance
as
i
surveyed
their
abode
and
heard
their
numbers
might
have
given
them
a
hint
to
that
effect
but
i
really
do
find
these
poor
creatures
patient
of
so
much
misery
that
it
inclines
me
the
more
to
heed
as
well
as
hear
their
petitions
and
complaints
when
they
bring
them
to
me
after
my
return
home
i
had
my
usual
evening
reception
and
among
other
pleasant
incidents
of
plantation
life
heard
the
following
agreeable
anecdote
from
a
woman
named
sophy
who
came
to
beg
for
some
rice
in
asking
her
about
her
husband
and
children
she
said
she
had
never
had
any
husband
that
she
had
had
two
children
by
a
white
man
of
the
name
of
walker
who
was
employed
at
the
mill
on
the
rice
island
she
was
in
the
hospital
after
the
birth
of
the
second
child
she
bore
this
man
and
at
the
same
time
two
women
judy
and
sylla
of
whose
children
k
was
the
father
were
recovering
from
their
confinements
it
was
not
a
month
since
any
of
them
had
been
delivered
when
k
came
to
the
hospital
had
them
all
three
severely
flogged
a
process
which
personally
superintended
and
then
sent
them
to
five
pound
the
swamp
botany
bay
of
the
plantation
of
which
i
have
told
you
with
further
orders
to
the
drivers
to
flog
them
every
day
for
a
week
now
e
if
i
make
you
sick
with
these
disgusting
stories
i
can
not
help
it
they
are
the
life
itself
here
hitherto
i
have
thought
these
details
intolerable
enough
but
this
apparition
of
a
female
fiend
in
the
middle
of
this
hell
i
confess
adds
an
element
of
cruelty
which
seems
to
me
to
surpass
all
the
rest
jealousy
is
not
an
uncommon
quality
in
the
feminine
temperament
and
just
conceive
the
fate
of
these
unfortunate
women
between
the
passions
of
their
masters
and
mistresses
each
alike
armed
with
power
to
oppress
and
torture
them
sophy
went
on
to
say
that
isaac
was
her
son
by
driver
morris
who
had
forced
her
while
she
was
in
her
miserable
exile
at
five
pound
almost
beyond
my
patience
with
this
string
of
detestable
details
i
exclaimed
foolishly
enough
heaven
knows
but
do
you
know
did
nobody
ever
tell
or
teach
any
of
you
that
it
is
a
sin
to
live
with
men
who
are
not
your
husbands
alas
e
what
could
the
poor
creature
answer
but
what
she
did
seizing
me
at
the
same
time
vehemently
by
the
wrist
yes
missis
we
know
we
know
all
about
dat
well
enough
but
we
do
anything
to
get
our
poor
flesh
some
rest
from
de
whip
when
he
made
me
follow
him
into
de
bush
what
use
me
tell
him
no
he
have
strength
to
make
me
i
have
written
down
the
woman
words
i
wish
i
could
write
down
the
voice
and
look
of
abject
misery
with
which
they
were
spoken
now
you
will
observe
that
the
story
was
not
told
to
me
as
a
complaint
it
was
a
thing
long
past
and
over
of
which
she
only
spoke
in
the
natural
course
of
accounting
for
her
children
to
me
i
make
no
comment
what
need
or
can
i
add
to
such
stories
but
how
is
such
a
state
of
things
to
endure
and
again
how
is
it
to
end
while
i
was
pondering
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
slough
of
despond
on
this
miserable
creature
story
another
woman
came
in
tema
carrying
in
her
arms
a
child
the
image
of
the
mulatto
bran
she
came
to
beg
for
flannel
i
asked
her
who
was
her
husband
she
said
she
was
not
married
her
child
is
the
child
of
bricklayer
temple
who
has
a
wife
at
the
rice
island
by
this
time
what
do
you
think
of
the
moralities
as
well
as
the
amenities
of
slave
life
these
are
the
conditions
which
can
only
be
known
to
one
who
lives
among
them
flagrant
acts
of
cruelty
may
be
rare
but
this
ineffable
state
of
utter
degradation
this
really
existence
is
the
normal
condition
of
these
men
and
women
and
of
that
no
one
seems
to
take
heed
nor
have
i
ever
heard
it
described
so
as
to
form
any
adequate
conception
of
it
till
i
found
myself
plunged
into
it
where
and
how
is
one
to
begin
the
cleansing
of
this
horrid
pestilential
immondezzio
of
an
existence
it
is
wednesday
the
of
march
we
can
not
stay
here
much
longer
i
wonder
if
i
shall
come
back
again
and
whether
when
i
do
i
shall
find
the
trace
of
one
idea
of
a
better
life
left
in
these
poor
people
minds
by
my
sojourn
among
them
one
of
my
industries
this
morning
has
been
cutting
out
another
dress
for
one
of
our
women
who
had
heard
of
my
tailoring
prowess
at
the
rice
island
the
material
as
usual
was
a
miserable
cotton
like
the
scarf
of
iris
while
shaping
it
for
my
client
i
ventured
to
suggest
the
idea
of
the
possibility
of
a
change
of
the
nethermost
as
well
as
the
uppermost
garment
this
i
imagine
is
a
conception
that
has
never
dawned
upon
the
female
slave
mind
on
this
plantation
they
receive
twice
a
year
a
certain
supply
of
clothing
and
wear
them
as
i
have
heard
some
nasty
fine
ladies
do
their
stays
for
fear
they
should
get
out
of
shape
without
washing
till
they
receive
the
next
suit
under
these
circumstances
i
think
it
is
unphilosophical
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
speak
of
the
negroes
as
a
race
whose
unfragrance
is
and
the
result
of
special
organisation
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
been
delighted
surprised
and
the
very
least
perplexed
by
the
sudden
petition
on
the
part
of
our
young
waiter
aleck
that
i
will
teach
him
to
read
he
is
a
very
intelligent
lad
of
about
sixteen
and
preferred
his
request
with
an
urgent
humility
that
was
very
touching
i
told
him
i
would
think
about
it
i
mean
to
do
it
i
will
do
it
and
yet
it
is
simply
breaking
the
laws
of
the
government
under
which
i
am
living
unrighteous
laws
are
made
to
be
broken
but
then
you
see
i
am
a
woman
and
stands
between
me
and
the
penalty
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
do
that
and
many
a
thing
besides
and
doubtless
should
be
shot
some
fine
day
from
behind
a
tree
by
some
good
neighbour
who
would
do
the
community
a
service
by
quietly
getting
rid
of
a
mischievous
incendiary
and
i
promise
you
in
such
a
case
no
questions
would
be
asked
and
my
lessons
would
come
to
a
speedy
and
silent
end
but
teaching
slaves
to
read
is
a
fineable
offence
and
i
am
and
my
fines
must
be
paid
by
my
legal
owner
and
the
first
offence
of
the
sort
is
heavily
fined
and
the
second
more
heavily
fined
and
for
the
third
one
is
sent
to
prison
what
a
pity
it
is
i
ca
begin
with
aleck
third
lesson
because
going
to
prison
ca
be
done
by
proxy
and
that
penalty
would
light
upon
the
right
shoulders
i
certainly
intend
to
teach
aleck
to
read
i
certainly
wo
tell
anything
about
it
i
leave
him
to
find
it
out
as
slaves
and
servants
and
children
and
all
oppressed
and
ignorant
and
uneducated
and
unprincipled
people
do
then
if
he
forbids
me
i
can
stop
perhaps
before
then
the
lad
may
have
learnt
his
letters
i
begin
to
perceive
one
most
admirable
circumstance
in
this
slavery
you
are
absolute
on
your
own
plantation
no
testimony
avails
against
you
and
no
white
testimony
exists
but
such
as
you
choose
to
admit
some
owners
have
a
fancy
for
maiming
their
slaves
some
brand
them
some
pull
out
their
teeth
some
shoot
them
a
little
here
and
there
all
details
gathered
from
advertisements
of
runaway
slaves
in
southern
papers
now
they
do
all
this
on
their
plantations
where
nobody
comes
to
see
and
i
teach
aleck
to
read
for
nobody
is
here
to
see
at
least
nobody
whose
seeing
i
mind
and
i
teach
every
other
creature
that
wants
to
learn
i
have
much
more
than
a
week
to
remain
in
this
blessed
purgatory
in
that
last
week
perhaps
i
may
teach
the
boy
enough
to
go
on
alone
when
i
am
gone
i
took
a
long
ride
all
through
some
new
woods
and
fields
and
finally
came
upon
a
large
space
sown
with
corn
for
the
people
here
i
was
accosted
by
such
a
shape
as
i
never
beheld
in
the
worst
of
my
dreams
it
looked
at
first
as
it
came
screaming
towards
me
like
a
live
specimen
of
the
arms
of
the
isle
of
man
which
as
you
may
or
may
not
know
are
three
legs
joined
together
and
kicking
in
different
directions
this
uncouth
device
is
not
an
invention
of
the
manxmen
for
it
is
found
on
some
very
ancient
coins
greek
i
believe
but
at
any
rate
it
is
now
the
device
of
our
subject
island
of
man
and
like
that
set
in
motion
and
nothing
else
was
the
object
that
approached
me
only
it
had
a
head
where
the
three
legs
were
joined
and
a
voice
came
out
of
the
head
to
this
effect
missis
you
hab
to
take
me
out
of
dis
here
bird
field
me
no
able
to
run
after
birds
and
ebery
night
me
lick
because
me
no
run
after
dem
when
this
apparition
reached
me
and
stood
as
still
as
it
could
i
perceived
it
consisted
of
a
boy
who
said
his
name
was
de
bird
driver
i
suppose
some
vague
idea
of
the
fitness
of
things
had
induced
them
to
send
this
living
scarecrow
into
the
cornfield
and
if
he
had
been
set
up
in
the
midst
of
it
nobody
i
am
sure
would
have
imagined
he
was
anything
else
but
it
seems
he
was
expected
to
run
after
the
feathered
fowl
who
alighted
on
the
grain
field
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
he
did
not
fulfil
this
expectation
his
feet
legs
and
knees
were
all
maimed
and
distorted
his
legs
were
nowhere
thicker
than
my
wrist
his
feet
were
a
yard
apart
from
each
other
and
his
knees
swollen
and
knocking
together
what
a
creature
to
ran
after
birds
he
implored
me
to
give
him
some
meat
and
have
him
sent
back
to
little
simon
island
from
which
he
came
and
where
he
said
his
poor
limbs
were
stronger
and
better
riding
home
i
passed
some
sassafras
trees
which
are
putting
forth
deliciously
fragrant
tassels
of
small
leaves
and
blossoms
and
other
exquisite
flowering
shrubs
which
are
new
to
me
and
enchant
me
perhaps
all
the
more
for
their
strangeness
before
reaching
the
house
i
was
stopped
by
one
of
our
multitudinous
jennies
with
a
request
for
some
meat
and
that
i
would
help
her
with
some
clothes
for
ben
and
daphne
of
whom
she
had
the
sole
charge
these
are
two
extremely
pretty
and
mulatto
children
whose
resemblance
to
k
had
induced
me
to
ask
when
first
i
saw
them
if
he
did
not
think
they
must
be
his
children
he
said
they
were
certainly
like
him
but
k
did
not
acknowledge
the
relationship
i
asked
jenny
who
their
mother
was
their
father
k
old
mr
k
r
k
told
you
so
who
ought
to
know
k
denies
it
because
he
never
has
looked
upon
them
nor
done
a
thing
for
them
but
he
acknowledged
renty
as
his
son
why
should
he
deny
these
old
master
was
here
then
when
renty
was
born
and
he
made
betty
tell
all
about
it
and
k
had
to
own
it
but
nobody
knows
anything
about
this
and
so
he
denies
it
with
which
information
i
rode
home
i
always
give
you
an
exact
report
of
any
conversation
i
may
have
with
any
of
the
people
and
you
see
from
this
that
the
people
on
the
plantation
themselves
are
much
of
my
worthy
neighbour
c
mind
that
the
death
of
major
was
a
great
misfortune
for
the
slaves
on
his
estate
i
went
to
the
hospital
this
afternoon
to
see
if
the
condition
of
the
poor
people
was
at
all
improved
since
i
had
been
last
there
but
nothing
had
been
done
i
suppose
g
is
waiting
for
to
come
down
in
order
to
speak
to
him
about
it
i
found
some
miserable
new
cases
of
women
disabled
by
hard
work
one
poor
thing
called
priscilla
had
come
out
of
the
fields
scarcely
able
to
crawl
she
has
been
losing
blood
for
a
whole
fortnight
without
intermission
and
until
was
labouring
in
the
fields
leah
another
new
face
since
i
visited
the
hospital
last
is
lying
quite
helpless
from
exhaustion
she
is
advanced
in
her
pregnancy
and
doing
task
work
in
the
fields
at
the
same
time
what
piteous
existences
to
be
sure
i
do
wonder
as
i
walk
among
them
well
fed
well
clothed
young
strong
idle
doing
nothing
but
ride
and
drive
about
all
day
a
woman
a
creature
like
themselves
who
have
borne
children
too
what
sort
of
feeling
they
have
towards
me
i
wonder
it
is
not
one
of
murderous
hate
that
they
should
lie
here
almost
dying
with
unrepaid
labour
for
me
i
stand
and
look
at
them
and
these
thoughts
work
in
my
mind
and
heart
till
i
feel
as
if
i
must
tell
them
how
dreadful
and
how
monstrous
it
seems
to
me
myself
and
how
bitterly
ashamed
and
grieved
i
feel
for
it
all
i
rode
in
the
morning
round
poor
cripple
jack
bird
field
again
through
the
sweet
pine
land
and
home
by
my
new
road
cut
through
jones
wood
of
which
i
am
as
proud
as
if
i
had
made
instead
of
found
it
the
grass
flowering
shrubs
and
all
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
in
the
wood
wagon
back
to
jones
and
visited
busson
hill
on
the
way
with
performances
of
certain
promises
of
flannel
quarters
of
dollars
at
jones
the
women
had
all
done
their
work
at
a
quarter
past
three
and
had
swept
their
huts
out
very
scrupulously
for
my
reception
their
dwellings
are
shockingly
dilapidated
and
poor
creatures
and
it
seems
hard
that
while
exhorting
them
to
spend
labour
in
cleaning
and
making
them
tidy
i
can
not
promise
them
that
they
shall
be
repaired
and
made
habitable
for
them
in
driving
home
through
my
new
wood
cut
jack
gave
me
a
terrible
account
of
a
flogging
that
a
negro
called
glasgow
had
received
yesterday
he
seemed
awfully
impressed
with
it
so
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
an
unusually
severe
punishment
but
he
either
would
not
or
could
not
tell
me
what
the
man
had
done
on
my
return
to
the
house
i
found
had
come
down
from
the
rice
plantation
whereat
i
was
much
delighted
on
all
accounts
i
am
sure
it
is
getting
much
too
late
for
him
to
remain
in
that
pestilential
swampy
atmosphere
besides
i
want
him
to
see
my
improvements
in
the
new
wood
paths
and
i
want
him
to
come
and
hear
all
these
poor
people
complaints
and
petitions
himself
they
have
been
flocking
in
to
see
him
ever
since
it
was
known
he
had
arrived
i
met
coming
on
that
errand
dandy
the
husband
of
the
woman
for
whom
i
cut
out
the
gown
the
other
day
and
asking
him
how
it
had
answered
he
gave
a
piteous
account
of
its
tearing
all
to
pieces
the
first
time
she
put
it
on
it
had
appeared
to
me
perfectly
rotten
and
good
for
nothing
and
upon
questioning
him
as
to
where
he
bought
it
and
what
he
paid
for
it
i
had
to
hear
a
sad
account
of
hardship
and
injustice
i
have
told
you
that
the
people
collect
moss
from
the
trees
and
sell
it
to
the
shopkeepers
in
darien
for
the
purpose
of
stuffing
furniture
they
also
raise
poultry
and
are
allowed
to
dispose
of
the
eggs
in
the
same
way
it
seems
that
poor
dandy
had
taken
the
miserable
material
edie
gown
was
made
of
as
payment
for
a
quantity
of
moss
and
eggs
furnished
by
him
at
various
times
to
one
of
the
darien
storekeepers
who
refused
him
payment
in
any
other
shape
and
the
poor
fellow
had
no
redress
and
this
he
tells
me
is
a
frequent
experience
with
all
the
slaves
both
here
and
at
the
rice
island
of
course
the
rascally
shopkeepers
can
cheat
these
poor
wretches
to
any
extent
they
please
with
perfect
impunity
told
me
of
a
visit
renty
paid
him
which
was
not
a
little
curious
in
some
of
its
particulars
you
know
none
of
the
slaves
are
allowed
the
use
of
fire
arms
but
renty
put
up
a
petition
to
be
allowed
k
gun
which
it
seems
that
gentleman
left
behind
him
refused
this
petition
saying
at
the
same
time
to
the
lad
that
he
knew
very
well
that
none
of
the
people
were
allowed
guns
renty
expostulated
on
the
score
of
his
and
finding
his
master
uninfluenced
by
that
consideration
departed
with
some
severe
reflections
on
k
his
father
for
not
having
left
him
his
gun
as
a
keepsake
in
token
of
paternal
affection
when
he
left
the
plantation
it
is
quite
late
and
i
am
very
tired
though
i
have
not
done
much
more
than
usual
but
the
weather
is
beginning
to
be
oppressive
to
me
who
hate
heat
but
i
find
the
people
and
especially
the
sick
in
the
hospital
speak
of
it
as
cold
i
will
tell
you
hereafter
of
a
most
comical
account
has
given
me
of
the
prolonged
and
still
protracted
of
a
woman
called
markie
who
for
many
more
months
than
are
generally
required
for
the
process
of
continuing
the
human
species
pretended
to
be
what
the
germans
pathetically
and
poetically
call
good
hope
and
continued
to
reap
increased
rations
as
the
reward
of
her
expectation
till
she
finally
had
to
disappoint
the
estate
and
receive
a
flogging
he
told
me
too
what
interested
me
very
much
of
a
conspiracy
among
c
slaves
some
years
ago
i
can
not
tell
you
about
it
now
i
will
some
other
time
it
is
wonderful
to
me
that
such
attempts
are
not
being
made
the
whole
time
among
these
people
to
regain
their
liberty
probably
because
many
are
made
ineffectually
and
never
known
beyond
the
limits
of
the
plantation
where
they
take
place
dear
e
we
have
been
having
something
like
northern
march
weather
blinding
sun
blinding
wind
and
blinding
dust
through
all
which
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
rode
together
round
most
of
the
fields
and
over
the
greater
part
of
the
plantation
it
was
a
detestable
process
the
more
so
that
he
rode
montreal
and
i
miss
kate
and
we
had
no
small
difficulty
in
managing
them
both
in
the
afternoon
we
had
an
equally
detestable
drive
through
the
new
wood
paths
to
annie
and
having
accomplished
all
my
errands
among
the
people
there
we
crossed
over
certain
sounds
and
seas
and
separating
waters
to
pay
a
neighbourly
visit
to
the
wife
of
one
of
our
adjacent
planters
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
you
to
conceive
even
if
i
could
describe
the
careless
desolation
which
pervaded
the
whole
place
the
shaggy
unkempt
grounds
we
passed
through
to
approach
the
house
the
ruinous
rackrent
house
itself
the
untidy
slatternly
all
but
beggarly
appearance
of
the
mistress
of
the
mansion
herself
the
smallest
yankee
farmer
has
a
tidier
estate
a
tidier
house
and
a
tidier
wife
than
this
member
of
the
proud
southern
chivalry
who
however
inasmuch
as
he
has
slaves
is
undoubtedly
a
much
greater
personage
in
his
own
estimation
than
those
capital
fellows
w
and
b
who
walk
in
glory
and
in
joy
behind
their
ploughs
upon
your
mountain
sides
the
brunswick
canal
project
was
descanted
upon
and
pronounced
without
a
shadow
of
dissent
a
scheme
the
impracticability
of
which
all
but
convicted
its
projectors
of
insanity
certainly
if
as
i
hear
the
monied
men
of
boston
have
gone
largely
into
this
speculation
their
habitual
sagacity
must
have
been
seriously
at
fault
for
here
on
the
spot
nobody
mentions
the
project
but
as
a
subject
of
utter
derision
while
the
men
discussed
about
this
matter
b
favoured
me
with
the
congratulations
i
have
heard
so
many
times
on
the
subject
of
my
having
a
white
nursery
maid
for
my
children
of
course
she
went
into
the
old
subject
of
the
utter
incompetency
of
negro
women
to
discharge
such
an
office
faithfully
but
in
spite
of
her
multiplied
examples
of
their
utter
inefficiency
i
believe
the
discussion
ended
by
simply
our
both
agreeing
that
ignorant
negro
girls
of
twelve
years
old
are
not
as
capable
or
trustworthy
as
white
women
of
thirty
returning
home
our
route
was
changed
and
quash
the
boatman
took
us
all
the
way
round
by
water
to
hampton
i
should
have
told
you
that
our
exit
was
as
wild
as
our
entrance
to
this
estate
and
was
made
through
a
broken
wooden
fence
which
we
had
to
climb
partly
over
and
partly
under
with
some
risk
and
some
obloquy
in
spite
of
our
dexterity
as
i
tore
my
dress
and
very
nearly
fell
flat
on
my
face
in
the
process
our
row
home
was
perfectly
enchanting
for
though
the
morning
wind
and
i
suppose
the
state
of
the
tide
had
roughened
the
waters
of
the
great
river
and
our
passage
was
not
as
smooth
as
it
might
have
been
the
wind
had
died
away
the
evening
air
was
deliciously
still
and
mild
and
soft
a
young
slip
of
a
moon
glimmered
just
above
the
horizon
and
stars
climbed
up
the
sapphire
steps
of
heaven
while
we
made
our
way
over
the
rolling
rushing
foaming
waves
and
saw
to
right
and
left
the
marsh
fires
burning
in
the
swampy
meadows
adding
another
coloured
light
in
the
landscape
to
the
lower
sky
and
the
violet
arch
above
and
giving
wild
picturesqueness
to
the
whole
scene
by
throwing
long
flickering
rays
of
flame
upon
the
distant
waters
the
i
read
service
again
to
the
people
you
can
not
conceive
anything
more
impressive
than
the
silent
devotion
of
their
whole
demeanour
while
it
lasted
nor
more
touching
than
the
profound
thanks
with
which
they
rewarded
me
when
it
was
over
and
they
took
their
leave
and
they
again
left
me
with
the
utmost
decorum
of
deportment
and
without
pressing
a
single
petition
or
complaint
such
as
they
ordinarily
thrust
upon
me
on
all
other
occasions
which
seems
to
me
an
instinctive
feeling
of
religious
respect
for
the
day
and
the
business
they
have
come
upon
which
does
them
infinite
credit
in
the
afternoon
i
took
a
long
walk
with
the
chicks
in
the
woods
long
at
least
for
the
little
legs
of
s
and
m
who
carried
baby
we
came
home
by
the
shore
and
i
stopped
to
look
at
a
jutting
point
just
below
which
a
small
sort
of
bay
would
have
afforded
the
most
capital
position
for
a
bathing
house
if
we
stayed
here
late
in
the
season
such
a
refreshment
would
become
almost
a
necessary
of
life
and
anywhere
along
the
bank
just
where
i
stopped
to
examine
it
an
establishment
for
that
purpose
might
be
prosperously
founded
i
am
amused
but
by
no
means
pleased
at
an
entirely
new
mode
of
pronouncing
which
s
has
adopted
apparently
the
negro
jargon
has
commended
itself
as
euphonious
to
her
infantile
ears
and
she
is
now
treating
me
to
the
most
ludicrous
and
accurate
imitations
of
it
every
time
she
opens
her
mouth
of
course
i
shall
not
allow
this
comical
as
it
is
to
become
a
habit
this
is
the
way
the
southern
ladies
acquire
the
thick
and
inelegant
pronunciation
which
distinguishes
their
utterances
from
the
northern
snuffle
and
i
have
no
desire
that
s
should
adorn
her
mother
tongue
with
either
peculiarity
it
is
a
curious
and
sad
enough
thing
to
observe
as
i
have
frequent
opportunities
of
doing
the
unbounded
insolence
and
tyranny
of
manner
of
course
it
can
go
no
farther
of
the
slaves
towards
each
other
you
boy
and
you
girl
shouted
in
an
imperious
scream
is
the
civillest
mode
of
apostrophising
those
at
a
distance
from
them
more
frequently
it
is
niggar
you
hear
hi
you
niggar
and
i
assure
you
no
contemptuous
white
intonation
ever
equalled
the
of
the
despotic
insolence
of
this
address
of
these
poor
wretches
to
each
other
i
have
left
my
letter
lying
for
a
couple
of
days
dear
e
i
have
been
busy
and
tired
my
walking
and
riding
is
becoming
rather
more
laborious
to
me
for
though
nobody
here
appears
to
do
so
i
am
beginning
to
feel
the
relaxing
influence
of
the
spring
the
day
before
yesterday
i
took
a
disagreeable
ride
all
through
swampy
fields
and
charred
blackened
thickets
to
discover
nothing
either
picturesque
or
beautiful
the
woods
in
one
part
of
the
plantation
have
been
on
fire
for
three
days
and
a
whole
tract
of
exquisite
evergreens
has
been
burnt
down
to
the
ground
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
in
the
wood
wagon
to
visit
the
people
at
annie
there
had
been
rain
these
last
two
nights
and
their
wretched
hovels
do
not
keep
out
the
weather
they
are
really
miserable
abodes
for
human
beings
i
think
pigs
who
were
at
all
particular
might
object
to
some
of
them
there
is
a
woman
at
this
settlement
called
sophy
the
wife
of
a
driver
morris
who
is
so
pretty
that
i
often
wonder
if
it
is
only
by
contrast
that
i
admire
her
so
much
or
if
her
gentle
sweet
refined
face
in
spite
of
its
dusky
colour
would
not
approve
itself
anywhere
to
any
one
with
an
eye
for
beauty
her
manner
and
voice
too
are
peculiarly
soft
and
gentle
but
indeed
the
voices
of
all
these
poor
people
men
as
well
as
women
are
much
pleasanter
and
more
melodious
than
the
voices
of
white
people
in
general
most
of
the
wretched
hovels
had
been
swept
and
tidied
out
in
expectation
of
my
visit
and
many
were
the
consequent
petitions
for
rations
of
meat
flannel
osnaburgs
etc
promising
all
which
in
due
proportion
to
the
cleanliness
of
each
separate
dwelling
i
came
away
on
my
way
home
i
called
for
a
moment
at
jones
settlement
to
leave
money
and
presents
promised
to
the
people
there
for
similar
improvement
in
the
condition
of
their
huts
i
had
not
time
to
stay
and
distribute
my
benefactions
myself
and
so
appointed
a
particularly
bright
intelligent
looking
woman
called
jenny
in
my
stead
and
her
deputed
authority
was
received
with
the
utmost
cheerfulness
by
them
all
i
have
been
having
a
long
talk
with
about
ben
and
daphne
those
two
young
mulatto
children
of
k
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
lately
poor
pretty
children
they
have
refined
and
sensitive
faces
as
well
as
straight
regular
features
and
the
expression
of
the
girl
countenance
as
well
as
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
the
sad
humility
of
her
deportment
are
indescribably
touching
b
expressed
the
strongest
interest
in
and
pity
for
them
of
their
it
seems
unjust
almost
to
the
rest
of
their
fellow
unfortunates
that
this
should
be
so
and
yet
it
is
almost
impossible
to
resist
the
impression
of
the
unfitness
of
these
two
forlorn
young
creatures
for
the
life
of
coarse
labour
and
dreadful
degradation
to
which
they
are
destined
in
any
of
the
southern
cities
the
girl
would
be
pretty
sure
to
be
reserved
for
a
worse
fate
but
even
here
death
seems
to
me
a
thousand
times
preferable
to
the
life
that
is
before
her
in
the
afternoon
i
rode
with
to
look
at
the
fire
in
the
woods
we
did
not
approach
it
but
stood
where
the
great
volumes
of
smoke
could
be
seen
rising
steadily
above
the
pines
as
they
have
now
continued
to
do
for
upwards
of
a
week
the
destruction
of
the
pine
timber
must
be
something
enormous
we
then
went
to
visit
and
g
and
wound
up
these
exercises
of
civilized
life
by
a
call
on
dear
old
c
whose
nursery
and
kitchen
garden
are
a
real
refreshment
to
my
spirits
how
completely
the
national
character
of
the
worthy
canny
old
scot
is
stamped
on
the
care
and
thrift
visible
in
his
whole
property
the
judicious
successful
culture
of
which
has
improved
and
adorned
his
dwelling
in
this
remote
corner
of
the
earth
the
comparison
or
rather
contrast
between
himself
and
his
quondam
neighbour
major
is
curious
enough
to
contemplate
the
scotch
tendency
of
the
one
to
turn
everything
to
good
account
the
irish
propensity
of
the
other
to
leave
everything
to
ruin
to
disorder
and
neglect
the
careful
economy
and
prudent
management
of
the
mercantile
man
the
reckless
profusion
and
careless
extravagance
of
the
soldier
the
one
made
a
splendid
fortune
and
spent
it
in
philadelphia
where
he
built
one
of
the
finest
houses
that
existed
there
in
the
days
when
fine
old
family
mansions
were
still
to
be
seen
breaking
the
monotonous
uniformity
of
the
quaker
city
the
other
has
resided
here
on
his
estate
ameliorating
the
condition
of
his
slaves
and
his
property
a
benefactor
to
the
people
and
the
soil
alike
a
useful
and
a
good
existence
an
obscure
and
tranquil
one
last
wednesday
we
drove
to
hamilton
by
far
the
finest
estate
on
simon
island
the
gentleman
to
whom
it
belongs
lives
i
believe
habitually
in
paris
but
captain
f
resides
on
it
and
i
suppose
is
the
real
overseer
of
the
plantation
all
the
way
along
the
road
we
traversed
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
island
we
found
great
tracts
of
wood
all
burnt
or
burning
the
destruction
had
spread
in
every
direction
and
against
the
sky
we
saw
the
slow
rising
of
the
smoky
clouds
that
showed
the
pine
forest
to
be
on
fire
still
what
an
immense
quantity
of
property
such
a
fire
must
destroy
the
negro
huts
on
several
of
the
plantations
that
we
passed
through
were
the
most
miserable
human
habitations
i
ever
beheld
the
wretched
hovels
at
annie
on
the
hampton
estate
that
had
seemed
to
me
the
plus
of
misery
were
really
palaces
to
some
of
the
dirty
desolate
dilapidated
dog
kennels
which
we
passed
and
out
of
which
the
negroes
poured
like
black
ants
at
our
approach
and
stood
to
gaze
at
us
as
we
drove
by
the
planters
residences
we
passed
were
only
three
it
makes
one
ponder
seriously
when
one
thinks
of
the
mere
handful
of
white
people
on
this
island
in
the
midst
of
this
large
population
of
slaves
how
absolutely
helpless
they
would
be
if
the
blacks
were
to
become
restive
they
could
be
destroyed
to
a
man
before
human
help
could
reach
them
from
the
main
or
the
tidings
even
of
what
was
going
on
be
carried
across
the
surrounding
waters
as
we
approached
the
southern
end
of
the
island
we
began
to
discover
the
line
of
the
white
sea
sands
beyond
the
bushes
and
fields
and
presently
above
the
sparkling
dazzling
line
of
snowy
white
for
the
sands
were
as
white
as
our
english
chalk
cliffs
stretched
the
deep
blue
sea
line
of
the
great
atlantic
ocean
we
found
that
there
had
been
a
most
terrible
fire
in
the
hamilton
woods
more
extensive
than
that
on
our
own
plantation
it
seems
as
if
the
whole
island
had
been
burning
at
different
points
for
more
than
a
week
what
a
cruel
pity
and
shame
it
does
seem
to
have
these
beautiful
masses
of
wood
so
destroyed
i
suppose
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
it
the
hands
make
fires
to
cook
their
food
wherever
they
happen
to
be
working
and
sometimes
through
their
careless
neglect
but
sometimes
too
undoubtedly
on
purpose
the
woods
are
set
fire
to
by
these
means
one
benefit
they
consider
that
they
derive
from
the
process
is
the
destruction
of
the
dreaded
rattlesnakes
that
infest
the
woodland
all
over
the
island
but
really
the
funeral
pyre
of
these
hateful
reptiles
is
too
costly
at
this
price
hamilton
struck
me
very
much
i
mean
the
whole
appearance
of
the
place
the
situation
of
the
house
the
noble
water
prospect
it
commanded
the
magnificent
old
oaks
near
it
a
luxuriant
vine
trellis
and
a
splendid
hedge
of
yucca
gloriosa
were
all
objects
of
great
delight
to
me
the
latter
was
most
curious
to
me
who
had
never
seen
any
but
single
specimens
of
the
plant
and
not
many
of
these
i
think
our
green
house
at
the
north
boasts
but
two
but
here
they
were
growing
close
together
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
a
compact
and
impenetrable
hedge
their
spiky
leaves
striking
out
on
all
sides
like
de
and
the
tall
slender
stems
that
bear
those
delicate
bells
of
blossoms
springing
up
against
the
sky
in
a
regular
row
i
wish
i
could
see
that
hedge
in
blossom
it
must
be
wonderfully
strange
and
lovely
and
must
look
by
moonlight
like
a
whole
range
of
fairy
chinese
pagodas
carved
in
ivory
at
dinner
we
had
some
delicious
green
peas
so
much
in
advance
of
you
are
we
down
here
with
the
seasons
do
you
think
one
might
accept
the
rattlesnakes
or
perhaps
indeed
the
slavery
for
the
sake
of
the
green
peas
is
a
world
of
compensations
a
life
of
compromises
you
know
and
one
should
learn
to
set
one
thing
against
another
if
one
means
to
thrive
and
fare
well
eat
green
peas
on
the
of
march
after
dinner
i
walked
up
and
down
before
the
house
for
a
long
while
with
f
and
had
a
most
interesting
conversation
with
her
about
the
negroes
and
all
the
details
of
their
condition
she
is
a
intelligent
woman
but
though
she
seemed
to
me
to
acquiesce
as
a
matter
of
inevitable
necessity
in
the
social
system
in
the
midst
of
which
she
was
born
and
lives
she
did
not
appear
to
me
by
several
things
she
said
to
be
by
any
means
in
love
with
it
she
gave
me
a
very
sad
character
of
k
confirming
by
her
general
description
of
him
the
impression
produced
by
all
the
details
i
have
received
from
our
own
people
as
for
any
care
for
the
moral
or
religious
training
of
the
slaves
that
she
said
was
a
matter
that
never
troubled
his
thoughts
indeed
his
only
notion
upon
the
subject
of
religion
she
said
was
that
it
was
something
for
white
women
and
children
we
drove
home
by
moonlight
and
as
we
came
towards
the
woods
in
the
middle
of
the
island
the
glittered
out
from
the
dusky
thickets
as
if
some
magical
golden
veil
was
every
now
and
then
shaken
out
into
the
darkness
the
air
was
enchantingly
mild
and
soft
and
the
whole
way
through
the
silvery
night
delightful
my
dear
friend
i
have
at
length
made
acquaintance
with
a
live
rattlesnake
old
scylla
had
the
pleasure
of
discovering
it
while
hunting
for
some
wood
to
burn
israel
captured
it
and
brought
it
to
the
house
for
my
edification
i
thought
it
an
beast
and
could
not
help
feeling
rather
nervous
while
contemplating
it
though
the
poor
thing
had
a
noose
round
its
neck
and
could
by
no
manner
of
means
have
extricated
itself
the
flat
head
and
vivid
vicious
eye
and
darting
tongue
were
none
of
them
lovely
to
behold
but
the
sort
of
threatening
whirr
produced
by
its
rattle
together
with
the
deepening
and
fading
of
the
marks
on
its
skin
either
with
its
respiration
or
the
emotions
of
fear
and
anger
it
was
enduring
were
peculiarly
dreadful
and
fascinating
it
was
quite
a
young
one
having
only
two
or
three
rattles
in
its
tail
these
as
you
probably
know
increase
in
number
by
one
annually
so
that
you
can
always
tell
the
age
of
the
amiable
serpent
you
are
examining
if
it
will
let
you
count
the
number
of
joints
of
its
rattle
captain
f
gave
me
the
rattle
of
one
which
had
as
many
as
twelve
joints
he
said
it
had
belonged
to
a
very
large
snake
which
had
crawled
from
under
a
fallen
tree
trunk
on
which
his
children
were
playing
after
exhibiting
his
interesting
captive
israel
killed
stuffed
and
presented
it
to
me
for
preservation
as
a
trophy
and
made
me
extremely
happy
by
informing
me
that
there
was
a
nest
of
them
where
this
one
was
found
i
think
with
terror
of
s
running
about
with
her
little
socks
not
reaching
up
her
legs
and
her
little
frocks
not
reaching
down
them
however
we
shall
probably
not
make
acquaintance
with
many
more
of
these
natives
of
georgia
as
we
are
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
now
to
the
north
we
shall
soon
be
free
again
this
morning
i
rode
to
the
burnt
district
and
attempted
to
go
through
it
at
clair
but
unsuccessfully
it
was
impossible
to
penetrate
through
the
charred
and
blackened
thickets
in
the
afternoon
i
walked
round
the
point
and
visited
the
houses
of
the
people
who
are
our
nearest
neighbours
i
found
poor
edie
in
sad
tribulation
at
the
prospect
of
resuming
her
field
labour
it
is
really
shameful
treatment
of
a
woman
just
after
child
labour
she
was
confined
exactly
three
weeks
ago
and
she
tells
me
she
is
ordered
out
to
field
work
on
monday
she
seems
to
dread
the
approaching
hardships
of
her
extremely
her
baby
was
born
dead
she
thinks
in
consequence
of
a
fall
she
had
while
carrying
a
heavy
weight
of
water
she
is
suffering
great
pain
in
one
of
her
legs
and
sides
and
seems
to
me
in
a
condition
utterly
unfit
for
any
work
much
less
hoeing
in
the
fields
but
i
dare
not
interfere
to
prevent
this
cruelty
she
says
she
has
already
had
to
go
out
to
work
three
weeks
after
her
confinement
with
each
of
her
other
children
and
does
not
complain
of
it
as
anything
special
in
her
case
she
says
that
is
now
the
invariable
rule
of
the
whole
plantation
though
it
used
not
to
be
so
formerly
i
have
let
my
letter
lie
since
i
wrote
the
above
dear
e
but
as
mine
is
a
story
without
beginning
middle
or
end
it
matters
extremely
little
where
i
leave
it
off
or
where
i
take
it
up
and
if
you
have
not
between
my
wood
rides
and
sick
slaves
come
to
falstaff
conclusion
that
i
have
iteration
you
are
patient
of
sameness
but
the
days
are
like
each
other
and
the
rides
and
the
people
and
alas
their
conditions
do
not
vary
however
my
visit
to
the
infirmary
was
marked
by
an
event
which
has
not
occurred
before
the
death
of
one
of
the
poor
slaves
while
i
was
there
i
found
on
entering
the
first
ward
to
use
a
most
inapplicable
term
for
the
dark
filthy
forlorn
room
i
have
so
christened
an
old
negro
called
friday
lying
on
the
ground
i
asked
what
ailed
him
and
was
told
he
was
dying
i
approached
him
and
perceived
from
the
glazed
eyes
and
the
feeble
rattling
breath
that
he
was
at
the
point
of
expiring
his
tattered
shirt
and
trousers
barely
covered
his
poor
body
his
appearance
was
that
of
utter
exhaustion
from
age
and
feebleness
he
had
nothing
under
him
but
a
mere
handful
of
straw
that
did
not
cover
the
earth
he
was
stretched
on
and
under
his
head
by
way
of
pillow
for
his
dying
agony
two
or
three
rough
sticks
just
raising
his
skull
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
the
flies
were
all
gathering
around
his
mouth
and
not
a
creature
was
near
him
there
he
lay
the
slave
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
unrequited
labour
for
me
and
mine
without
one
physical
alleviation
one
christian
solace
one
human
sympathy
to
cheer
him
in
his
extremity
panting
out
the
last
breath
of
his
wretched
existence
like
some
forsaken
beast
of
burthen
rotting
where
it
falls
i
bent
over
the
poor
awful
human
creature
in
the
supreme
hour
of
his
mortality
and
while
my
eyes
blinded
with
tears
of
unavailing
pity
and
horror
were
fixed
upon
him
there
was
a
sudden
quivering
of
the
eyelids
and
falling
of
the
jaw
and
he
was
free
i
stood
up
and
remained
long
lost
in
the
imagination
of
the
change
that
creature
had
undergone
and
in
the
tremendous
overwhelming
consciousness
of
the
deliverance
god
had
granted
the
soul
whose
vesture
of
decay
lay
at
my
feet
how
i
rejoiced
for
him
and
how
as
i
turned
to
the
wretches
who
were
calling
to
me
from
the
inner
room
whence
they
could
see
me
as
i
stood
contemplating
the
piteous
object
i
wished
they
all
were
gone
away
with
him
the
delivered
the
freed
by
death
from
bitter
bitter
bondage
in
the
next
room
i
found
a
miserable
decrepid
old
negress
called
charity
lying
sick
and
i
should
think
near
too
to
die
but
she
did
not
think
her
work
was
over
much
as
she
looked
unfit
for
further
work
on
earth
but
with
feeble
voice
and
beseeching
hands
implored
me
to
have
her
work
lightened
when
she
was
sent
back
to
it
from
the
hospital
she
is
one
of
the
oldest
slaves
on
the
plantation
and
has
to
walk
to
her
field
labour
and
back
again
at
night
a
distance
of
nearly
four
miles
there
were
an
unusual
number
of
sick
women
in
the
room
among
them
quite
a
young
girl
daughter
of
boatman
quash
with
a
sick
baby
who
has
a
father
though
she
has
no
husband
poor
thing
she
looks
like
a
mere
child
herself
i
returned
home
so
very
sad
and
that
i
could
not
rouse
myself
to
the
effort
of
going
up
to
annie
with
the
presents
i
had
promised
the
people
there
i
sent
m
up
in
the
wood
wagon
with
them
and
remained
in
the
house
with
my
thoughts
which
were
none
of
the
merriest
dearest
e
on
friday
i
rode
to
where
the
rattlesnake
was
found
and
where
i
was
informed
by
the
negroes
there
was
a
of
them
a
pleasing
domestic
picture
of
home
and
infancy
that
word
suggests
not
altogether
appropriate
to
rattlesnakes
i
think
on
horseback
i
felt
bold
to
accomplish
this
adventure
which
i
certainly
should
not
have
attempted
on
foot
however
i
could
discover
no
sign
of
either
snake
or
nest
perhaps
it
is
of
the
nature
of
a
mare
nest
and
undiscoverable
but
having
done
my
duty
by
myself
in
endeavouring
to
find
it
i
rode
off
and
coasted
the
estate
by
the
side
of
the
marsh
till
i
came
to
the
causeway
there
i
found
a
new
cleared
field
and
stopped
to
admire
the
beautiful
appearance
of
the
stumps
of
the
trees
scattered
all
about
it
and
wreathed
and
garlanded
with
the
most
profuse
and
fantastic
growth
of
various
plants
wild
roses
being
among
the
most
abundant
what
a
lovely
aspect
one
side
of
nature
presents
here
and
how
hideous
is
the
other
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
to
pay
a
visit
to
old
a
the
lady
proprietress
whose
estate
immediately
adjoins
ours
on
my
way
thither
i
passed
a
woman
called
margaret
walking
rapidly
and
powerfully
along
the
road
she
was
returning
home
from
the
field
having
done
her
task
at
three
and
told
me
with
a
merry
beaming
black
face
that
she
was
going
clean
up
de
house
to
please
de
missis
on
driving
through
my
neighbour
grounds
i
was
disgusted
more
than
i
can
express
with
the
miserable
negro
huts
of
her
people
they
were
not
fit
to
shelter
cattle
they
were
not
fit
to
shelter
anything
for
they
were
literally
in
holes
and
as
we
used
to
say
of
our
stockings
at
school
too
bad
to
darn
to
be
sure
i
will
say
in
excuse
for
their
old
mistress
her
own
habitation
was
but
a
very
few
degrees
less
ruinous
and
disgusting
what
would
one
of
your
yankee
farmers
say
to
such
abodes
when
i
think
of
the
white
houses
the
green
blinds
and
the
flower
plots
of
the
villages
in
new
england
and
look
at
these
dwellings
of
lazy
filth
and
inert
degradation
it
does
seem
amazing
to
think
that
physical
and
moral
conditions
so
widely
opposite
should
be
found
among
people
occupying
a
similar
place
in
the
social
scale
of
the
same
country
the
northern
farmer
however
thinks
it
no
shame
to
work
the
southern
planter
does
and
there
begins
and
ends
the
difference
industry
man
crown
of
honour
elsewhere
is
here
his
badge
of
utter
degradation
and
so
comes
all
by
which
i
am
here
surrounded
pride
profligacy
idleness
cruelty
cowardice
ignorance
squalor
dirt
and
ineffable
abasement
when
i
returned
home
i
found
that
f
had
sent
me
some
magnificent
prawns
i
think
of
having
them
served
singly
and
divided
as
one
does
a
lobster
their
size
really
suggests
no
less
respect
i
rode
all
through
the
burnt
district
and
the
bush
to
w
field
in
making
my
way
out
of
which
i
was
very
nearly
swamped
and
but
for
the
valuable
assistance
of
a
certain
sable
scipio
who
came
up
and
extricated
me
i
might
be
floundering
hopelessly
there
still
he
got
me
out
of
my
slough
of
despond
and
put
me
in
the
way
to
a
charming
wood
ride
which
runs
between
w
and
colonel
h
grounds
while
going
along
this
delightful
boundary
of
these
two
neighbouring
estates
my
mind
not
unnaturally
dwelt
upon
the
terms
of
deadly
feud
in
which
the
two
families
owning
them
are
living
with
each
other
a
horrible
quarrel
has
occurred
quite
lately
upon
the
subject
of
the
ownership
of
this
very
ground
i
was
skirting
between
h
and
young
w
they
have
challenged
each
other
and
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
is
a
good
sample
of
the
sort
of
spirit
which
grows
up
among
slaveholders
so
read
it
for
it
is
curious
to
people
who
have
not
lived
habitually
among
savages
the
terms
of
the
challenge
that
has
passed
between
them
have
appeared
like
a
sort
of
advertisement
in
the
local
paper
and
are
to
the
effect
that
they
are
to
fight
at
a
certain
distance
with
certain
weapons
firearms
of
course
that
there
is
to
be
on
the
person
of
each
a
white
paper
or
mark
immediately
over
the
region
of
the
heart
as
a
point
for
direct
aim
and
whoever
kills
the
other
is
to
have
the
privilege
of
off
his
head
and
sticking
it
up
on
a
pole
on
the
piece
of
land
which
was
the
origin
of
the
so
that
some
fine
day
i
might
have
come
hither
as
i
did
and
found
myself
riding
under
the
shadow
of
the
gory
locks
of
h
or
w
my
peaceful
and
pleasant
neighbours
i
came
home
through
our
own
pine
woods
which
are
actually
a
wilderness
of
black
desolation
the
scorched
and
charred
tree
trunks
are
still
smoking
and
smouldering
the
ground
is
a
sort
of
charcoal
pavement
and
the
fire
is
still
burning
on
all
sides
for
the
smoke
was
rapidly
rising
in
several
directions
on
each
hand
of
the
path
i
pursued
across
this
dismal
scene
of
strange
destruction
bright
blue
and
red
birds
like
living
jewels
darted
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
i
wonder
if
the
fire
has
killed
and
scared
away
many
of
these
beautiful
creatures
in
the
afternoon
i
took
jack
with
me
to
clear
some
more
of
the
wood
paths
but
the
weather
is
what
i
call
hot
and
what
the
people
here
think
warm
and
the
air
was
literally
thick
with
little
black
points
of
insects
which
they
call
sand
flies
and
which
settle
upon
one
head
and
face
literally
like
a
black
net
you
hardly
see
them
or
feel
them
at
the
time
but
the
irritation
occasioned
by
them
is
intolerable
and
i
had
to
relinquish
my
work
and
fly
before
this
winged
plague
as
fast
as
i
could
from
my
new
acquaintance
the
rattlesnakes
jack
informed
me
in
the
course
of
our
expedition
that
the
woods
on
the
island
were
sometimes
burnt
away
in
order
to
leave
the
ground
in
grass
for
fodder
for
the
cattle
and
that
the
very
beautiful
ones
he
and
i
had
been
clearing
paths
through
were
not
unlikely
to
be
so
doomed
which
strikes
me
as
a
horrible
idea
in
the
evening
poor
edie
came
up
to
the
house
to
see
me
with
an
old
negress
called
sackey
who
has
been
one
of
the
chief
nurses
on
the
island
for
many
years
i
suppose
she
has
made
some
application
to
g
for
a
respite
for
edie
on
finding
how
terribly
unfit
she
is
for
work
or
perhaps
to
whom
i
represented
her
case
may
have
ordered
her
reprieve
but
she
came
with
much
gratitude
to
me
who
have
as
far
as
i
know
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
to
tell
me
that
she
is
not
able
to
be
sent
into
the
field
for
another
week
old
sackey
fully
confirmed
account
of
the
terrible
hardships
the
women
underwent
in
being
thus
driven
to
labour
before
they
had
recovered
from
she
said
that
old
major
allowed
the
women
at
the
rice
island
five
weeks
and
those
here
four
weeks
to
recover
from
a
confinement
and
then
never
permitted
them
for
some
time
after
they
resumed
their
work
to
labour
in
the
fields
before
sunrise
or
after
sunset
but
k
had
altered
that
arrangement
allowing
the
women
at
the
rice
island
only
four
weeks
and
those
here
only
three
weeks
for
their
recovery
then
missis
continued
the
old
woman
into
the
field
again
through
dew
and
dry
as
if
nothing
had
happened
that
is
why
missis
so
many
of
the
women
have
falling
of
the
womb
and
weakness
in
the
back
and
if
he
had
continued
on
the
estate
he
would
have
utterly
destroyed
all
the
breeding
women
sometimes
after
sending
them
back
into
the
field
at
the
expiration
of
their
three
weeks
they
would
work
for
a
day
or
two
she
said
and
then
fall
down
in
the
field
with
exhaustion
and
be
brought
to
the
hospital
almost
at
the
point
of
death
yesterday
sunday
i
had
my
last
service
at
home
with
these
poor
people
nearly
thirty
of
them
came
all
clean
neat
and
decent
in
their
dress
and
appearance
s
had
begged
very
hard
to
join
the
congregation
and
upon
the
most
solemn
promise
of
remaining
still
she
was
admitted
but
in
spite
of
the
perfect
honour
with
which
she
kept
her
promise
her
presence
disturbed
my
thoughts
not
a
little
and
added
much
to
the
poignancy
of
the
feeling
with
which
i
saw
her
father
poor
slaves
gathered
round
me
the
child
exquisite
complexion
large
grey
eyes
and
solemn
and
at
the
same
time
eager
countenance
was
such
a
wonderful
piece
of
contrast
to
their
sable
faces
so
many
of
them
so
uncouth
in
their
outlines
and
proportions
and
yet
all
of
them
so
pathetic
and
some
so
sublime
in
their
expression
of
patient
suffering
and
religious
fervour
their
eyes
never
wandered
from
me
and
my
child
who
sat
close
by
my
knee
their
little
mistress
their
future
providence
my
poor
baby
dear
e
bless
god
that
you
have
never
reared
a
child
with
such
an
awful
expectation
and
at
the
end
of
the
prayers
the
tears
were
streaming
over
their
faces
and
one
chorus
of
blessings
rose
round
me
and
the
child
farewell
blessings
and
prayers
that
we
would
return
and
thanks
so
fervent
in
their
incoherency
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
and
i
begged
them
to
go
away
and
leave
me
to
recover
myself
and
then
i
remained
with
s
and
for
quite
a
long
while
even
her
restless
spirit
was
still
in
wondering
amazement
at
my
bitter
crying
i
am
to
go
next
sunday
to
the
church
on
the
island
where
there
is
to
be
service
and
so
this
is
my
last
sunday
with
the
people
when
i
had
recovered
from
the
emotion
of
this
scene
i
walked
out
with
s
a
little
way
but
meeting
m
and
the
baby
she
turned
home
with
them
and
i
pursued
my
walk
alone
up
the
road
and
home
by
the
shore
they
are
threatening
to
burn
down
all
my
woods
to
make
grass
land
for
the
cattle
and
i
have
terrified
them
by
telling
them
that
i
will
never
come
back
if
they
destroy
the
woods
i
went
and
paid
a
visit
to
g
poor
little
helpless
woman
what
can
she
do
for
these
poor
people
where
i
who
am
supposed
to
own
them
can
do
nothing
and
yet
how
much
may
be
done
is
done
by
the
brain
and
heart
of
one
human
being
in
contact
with
another
we
are
answerable
for
incalculable
opportunities
of
good
and
evil
in
our
daily
intercourse
with
every
soul
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
every
meeting
every
parting
every
chance
greeting
and
every
appointed
encounter
are
occasions
open
to
us
for
which
we
are
to
account
to
our
children
our
servants
our
friends
our
acquaintances
to
each
and
all
every
day
and
all
day
long
we
are
distributing
that
which
is
best
or
worst
in
existence
influence
with
every
word
with
every
look
with
every
gesture
something
is
given
or
withheld
of
great
importance
it
may
be
to
the
receiver
of
inestimable
importance
to
the
giver
certainly
the
laws
and
enacted
statutes
on
which
this
detestable
system
is
built
up
are
potent
enough
the
social
prejudice
that
buttresses
it
is
almost
more
potent
still
and
yet
a
few
hearts
and
brains
well
bent
to
do
the
work
would
bring
within
this
almost
impenetrable
dungeon
of
ignorance
misery
and
degradation
in
which
so
many
millions
of
human
souls
lie
buried
that
freedom
of
god
which
would
presently
conquer
for
them
their
earthly
liberty
with
some
such
thoughts
i
commended
the
slaves
on
the
plantation
to
the
little
overseer
wife
i
did
not
tell
my
thoughts
to
her
they
would
have
scared
the
poor
little
woman
half
out
of
her
senses
to
begin
with
her
bread
her
husband
occupation
has
its
root
in
slavery
it
would
be
difficult
for
her
to
think
as
i
do
of
it
i
am
afraid
her
care
even
of
the
bodily
habits
and
sicknesses
of
the
people
left
in
g
charge
will
not
be
worth
much
for
nobody
treats
others
better
than
they
do
themselves
and
she
is
certainly
doing
her
best
to
injure
herself
and
her
own
poor
baby
who
is
two
and
years
old
and
whom
she
is
still
suckling
this
is
i
think
the
worst
case
of
this
extraordinary
delusion
so
prevalent
among
your
women
that
i
have
ever
met
with
yet
but
they
all
nurse
their
children
much
longer
than
is
good
for
either
baby
or
mother
the
summer
heat
particularly
when
a
young
baby
is
cutting
teeth
is
i
know
considered
by
young
american
mothers
an
exceedingly
critical
time
and
therefore
i
always
hear
of
babies
being
nursed
till
after
the
second
summer
so
that
a
child
born
in
january
would
be
suckled
till
it
was
eighteen
or
nineteen
months
old
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
weaned
till
its
second
summer
was
over
i
am
sure
that
nothing
can
be
worse
than
this
system
and
i
attribute
much
of
the
wretched
ill
health
of
young
american
mothers
to
over
nursing
and
of
course
a
process
that
destroys
their
health
and
vigour
completely
must
affect
most
unfavourably
the
child
they
are
suckling
it
is
a
grievous
mistake
i
remember
my
charming
friend
f
d
telling
me
that
she
had
nursed
her
first
child
till
her
second
was
born
a
miraculous
statement
which
i
can
only
believe
because
she
told
it
me
herself
whenever
anything
seems
absolutely
impossible
the
word
of
a
true
person
is
the
only
proof
of
it
worth
anything
dear
e
i
have
been
riding
into
the
swamp
behind
the
new
house
i
had
a
mind
to
survey
the
ground
all
round
it
before
going
away
to
see
what
capabilities
it
afforded
for
the
founding
of
a
garden
but
i
confess
it
looked
very
unpromising
trying
to
return
by
another
way
i
came
to
a
morass
which
after
contemplating
and
making
my
horse
try
for
a
few
paces
i
thought
it
expedient
not
to
attempt
a
woman
called
charlotte
who
was
working
in
the
field
seeing
my
dilemma
and
the
inglorious
retreat
i
was
about
to
make
shouted
to
me
at
the
top
of
her
voice
no
turn
back
missis
if
you
want
to
go
through
send
missis
send
you
hab
slave
enough
nigger
enough
let
come
let
fetch
planks
and
make
de
bridge
what
you
say
dey
must
do
send
missis
send
missis
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
lady
imperative
tone
in
my
behalf
that
if
she
had
been
in
my
place
she
would
presently
have
had
a
corduroy
road
through
the
swamp
of
prostrate
as
she
called
her
family
in
ham
and
ridden
over
the
same
and
to
be
sure
if
i
pleased
so
might
i
for
as
she
very
truly
said
you
say
missis
they
must
do
instead
of
summoning
her
sooty
tribe
however
i
backed
my
horse
out
of
the
swamp
and
betook
myself
to
another
pretty
woodpath
which
only
wants
widening
to
be
quite
charming
at
the
end
of
this
however
i
found
swamp
the
second
and
out
of
this
having
been
helped
by
a
grinning
facetious
personage
most
appropriately
named
pun
i
returned
home
in
dudgeon
in
spite
of
what
dear
miss
m
calls
the
suitability
of
finding
a
foul
bog
at
the
end
of
every
charming
wood
path
or
forest
ride
in
this
region
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
to
busson
hill
to
visit
the
people
there
i
found
that
both
the
men
and
women
had
done
their
work
at
three
saw
jema
with
her
child
that
ridiculous
image
of
driver
bran
in
her
arms
in
spite
of
whose
whitey
brown
skin
she
still
maintains
that
its
father
is
a
man
as
black
as
herself
and
she
to
use
a
most
extraordinary
comparison
i
heard
of
a
negro
girl
making
with
regard
to
her
mother
is
as
black
as
hinges
of
hell
query
did
she
really
mean
hinges
or
angels
the
angels
of
hell
is
a
polite
and
pretty
paraphrase
for
devils
certainly
in
complimenting
a
woman
called
joan
upon
the
tidy
condition
of
her
house
she
answered
with
that
cruel
humility
that
is
so
bad
an
element
in
their
character
no
to
find
coloured
house
clean
as
white
folks
the
mode
in
which
they
have
learned
to
accept
the
idea
of
their
own
degradation
and
unalterable
inferiority
is
the
most
serious
impediment
that
i
see
in
the
way
of
their
progress
since
assuredly
is
not
so
vile
a
sin
as
in
the
same
way
yesterday
abraham
the
cook
in
speaking
of
his
brother
theft
at
the
rice
island
said
was
a
shame
even
for
a
coloured
man
to
do
such
things
i
labour
hard
whenever
any
such
observation
is
made
to
explain
to
them
that
the
question
is
one
of
moral
and
mental
culture
not
the
colour
of
an
integument
and
assure
them
much
to
my
own
comfort
whatever
it
may
be
to
theirs
that
white
people
are
as
dirty
and
as
dishonest
as
coloured
folks
when
they
have
suffered
the
same
lack
of
decent
training
if
i
could
but
find
one
of
these
women
on
whose
mind
the
idea
had
dawned
that
she
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
my
equal
i
think
i
should
embrace
her
in
an
ecstacy
of
hopefulness
in
the
evening
while
i
was
inditing
my
journal
for
your
edification
jema
made
her
appearance
with
her
baby
having
walked
all
the
way
down
from
busson
hill
to
claim
a
little
sugar
i
had
promised
her
she
had
made
her
child
perfectly
clean
and
it
looked
quite
pretty
when
i
asked
her
what
i
should
give
her
the
sugar
in
she
snatched
her
filthy
handkerchief
off
her
head
but
i
declined
this
sugar
basin
and
gave
it
to
her
in
some
paper
hannah
came
on
the
same
errand
after
all
dear
e
we
shall
not
leave
georgia
so
soon
as
i
expected
we
can
not
get
off
for
at
least
another
week
you
know
our
movements
are
apt
to
be
both
tardy
and
uncertain
i
am
getting
sick
in
spirit
of
my
stay
here
but
i
think
the
spring
heat
is
beginning
to
affect
me
miserably
and
i
long
for
a
cooler
atmosphere
here
on
simon
the
climate
is
perfectly
healthy
and
our
neighbours
many
of
them
never
stir
from
their
plantations
within
reach
of
the
purifying
sea
influence
but
a
land
that
grows
magnolias
is
not
fit
for
me
i
was
going
to
say
magnolias
and
rattlesnakes
but
i
remember
k
adventure
with
her
friend
the
rattlesnake
of
monument
mountain
and
the
wild
hill
between
lenox
and
stockbridge
which
your
berkshire
farmers
have
christened
rattlesnake
mountain
these
agreeable
serpents
seem
like
the
lovely
little
humming
birds
which
are
found
in
your
northernmost
as
well
as
southernmost
states
to
have
an
accommodating
disposition
with
regard
to
climate
not
only
is
the
vicinity
of
the
sea
an
element
of
salubrity
here
but
the
great
masses
of
pine
wood
growing
in
every
direction
indicate
lightness
of
soil
and
purity
of
air
wherever
these
fragrant
dry
aromatic
fir
forests
extend
there
can
be
no
inherent
malaria
i
should
think
in
either
atmosphere
or
soil
the
beauty
and
profusion
of
the
weeds
and
wild
flowers
in
the
fields
now
is
something
too
enchanting
i
wish
i
could
spread
one
of
these
enamelled
tracts
on
the
side
of
one
of
your
hills
now
for
i
daresay
they
are
yet
i
must
give
you
an
account
of
aleck
first
reading
lesson
which
took
place
at
the
same
time
that
i
gave
s
hers
this
morning
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
had
leisure
to
come
and
it
went
off
most
successfully
he
seems
to
me
by
no
means
stupid
i
am
very
sorry
he
did
not
ask
me
to
do
this
before
however
if
he
can
master
his
alphabet
before
i
go
he
may
if
chance
favour
him
with
the
occasional
sight
of
a
book
help
himself
on
by
degrees
perhaps
he
will
have
the
good
inspiration
to
apply
to
cooper
london
for
assistance
i
am
much
mistaken
if
that
worthy
does
not
contrive
that
heaven
shall
help
aleck
as
it
formerly
did
him
in
the
matter
of
reading
i
rode
with
jack
afterwards
showing
him
where
i
wish
paths
to
be
cut
and
brushwood
removed
i
passed
the
new
house
and
again
circumvented
it
meditatingly
to
discover
its
available
points
of
possible
future
comeliness
but
remained
as
convinced
as
ever
that
there
are
absolutely
none
within
the
last
two
days
a
perfect
border
of
the
dark
blue
virginicum
has
burst
into
blossom
on
each
side
of
the
road
fringing
it
with
purple
as
far
as
one
can
look
along
it
it
is
lovely
i
must
tell
you
of
something
which
has
delighted
me
greatly
i
told
jack
yesterday
that
if
any
of
the
boys
liked
when
they
had
done
their
tasks
to
come
and
clear
the
paths
that
i
want
widened
and
trimmed
i
would
pay
them
a
certain
small
sum
per
hour
for
their
labour
and
behold
three
boys
have
come
having
done
their
tasks
early
in
the
afternoon
to
apply
for
and
so
much
for
a
suggestion
not
barely
hours
old
and
so
much
for
a
prospect
of
compensation
in
the
evenings
i
attempted
to
walk
out
when
the
air
was
cool
but
had
to
run
precipitately
back
into
the
house
to
escape
from
the
clouds
of
that
had
settled
on
my
neck
and
arms
the
weather
has
suddenly
become
intensely
hot
at
least
that
is
what
it
appears
to
me
after
i
had
come
in
i
had
a
visit
from
venus
and
her
daughter
a
young
girl
of
ten
years
old
for
whom
she
begged
a
larger
allowance
of
food
as
she
said
what
she
received
for
her
was
totally
inadequate
to
the
girl
proper
nourishment
i
was
amazed
upon
enquiry
to
find
that
three
quarts
of
grits
a
week
that
is
not
a
pint
a
day
was
considered
a
sufficient
supply
for
children
of
her
age
the
mother
said
her
child
was
on
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
terribly
little
my
little
workmen
have
brought
me
in
from
the
woods
three
darling
little
rabbits
which
they
have
contrived
to
catch
they
seemed
to
me
slightly
different
from
our
english
bunnies
and
captain
f
who
called
gave
me
a
long
account
of
how
they
differed
from
the
same
animal
in
the
northern
states
i
did
not
like
to
mortify
my
small
workmen
by
refusing
their
present
but
the
poor
little
things
must
be
left
to
run
wild
again
for
we
have
no
conveniences
for
pets
here
besides
we
are
just
weighing
anchor
ourselves
i
hope
these
poor
little
fluffy
things
will
not
meet
any
rattlesnakes
on
their
way
back
to
the
woods
i
had
a
visit
for
flannel
from
one
of
our
dianas
who
had
done
her
task
in
the
middle
of
the
day
yet
came
to
receive
her
flannel
the
most
horribly
dirty
human
creature
i
ever
beheld
unless
indeed
her
child
whom
she
brought
with
her
may
have
been
half
a
degree
dirtier
the
other
day
psyche
you
remember
the
pretty
under
nurse
the
poor
thing
whose
story
i
wrote
you
from
the
rice
plantation
asked
me
if
her
mother
and
brothers
might
be
allowed
to
come
and
see
her
when
we
are
gone
away
i
asked
her
some
questions
about
them
and
she
told
me
that
one
of
her
brothers
who
belonged
to
k
was
hired
by
that
gentleman
to
a
g
of
darien
and
that
upon
the
latter
desiring
to
purchase
him
k
had
sold
the
man
without
apprising
him
or
any
one
member
of
his
family
that
he
had
done
so
a
humane
proceeding
that
makes
one
blood
boil
when
one
hears
of
it
he
had
owned
the
man
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
psyche
urged
me
very
much
to
obtain
an
order
permitting
her
to
see
her
mother
and
brothers
i
will
try
and
obtain
it
for
her
but
there
seems
generally
a
great
objection
to
the
visits
of
slaves
from
neighbouring
plantations
and
i
have
no
doubt
not
without
sufficient
reason
the
more
i
see
of
this
frightful
and
perilous
social
system
the
more
i
feel
that
those
who
live
in
the
midst
of
it
must
make
their
whole
existence
one
constant
precaution
against
danger
of
some
sort
or
other
i
have
given
aleck
a
second
reading
lesson
with
s
who
takes
an
extreme
interest
in
his
newly
acquired
alphabetical
lore
he
is
a
very
quick
and
attentive
scholar
and
i
should
think
a
very
short
time
would
suffice
to
teach
him
to
read
but
alas
i
have
not
even
that
short
time
when
i
had
done
with
my
class
i
rode
off
with
jack
who
has
become
quite
an
expert
horseman
and
rejoices
in
being
lifted
out
of
the
immediate
region
of
snakes
by
the
length
of
his
horse
legs
i
cantered
through
the
new
wood
paths
and
took
a
good
sloping
gallop
through
the
pine
land
to
annie
the
fire
is
actually
still
burning
in
the
woods
i
came
home
quite
tired
with
the
heat
though
my
ride
was
not
a
long
one
just
as
i
had
taken
off
my
habit
and
was
preparing
to
start
off
with
m
and
the
chicks
for
jones
in
the
wood
wagon
old
dorcas
one
of
the
most
decrepid
rheumatic
and
miserable
old
negresses
from
the
further
end
of
the
plantation
called
in
to
beg
for
some
sugar
she
had
walked
the
whole
way
from
her
own
settlement
and
seemed
absolutely
exhausted
then
and
yet
she
had
to
walk
all
the
way
back
it
was
not
otherwise
than
slightly
meritorious
in
me
my
dear
e
to
take
her
up
in
the
wagon
and
endure
her
abominable
dirt
and
foulness
in
the
closest
proximity
rather
than
let
her
drag
her
poor
old
limbs
all
that
way
back
but
i
was
glad
when
we
gained
her
abode
and
lost
her
company
i
am
mightily
reminded
occasionally
in
these
parts
of
trinculo
soliloquy
over
caliban
the
people
at
jones
had
done
their
work
at
three
most
of
the
houses
were
tidy
and
clean
so
were
many
of
the
babies
on
visiting
the
cabin
of
an
exceedingly
decent
woman
called
peggy
i
found
her
to
my
surprise
possessed
of
a
fine
large
bible
she
told
me
her
husband
carpenter
john
can
read
and
that
she
means
to
make
him
teach
her
the
fame
of
aleck
literature
has
evidently
reached
jones
and
they
are
not
afraid
to
tell
me
that
they
can
read
or
wish
to
learn
to
do
so
this
poor
woman
health
is
miserable
i
never
saw
a
more
weakly
sickly
looking
creature
she
says
she
has
been
broken
down
ever
since
the
birth
of
her
last
child
i
asked
her
how
soon
after
her
confinement
she
went
out
into
the
field
to
work
again
she
answered
very
quietly
but
with
a
deep
sigh
weeks
missis
de
usual
time
as
i
was
going
away
a
man
named
martin
came
up
and
with
great
vehemence
besought
me
to
give
him
a
in
the
evening
he
came
down
to
fetch
it
and
to
show
me
that
he
can
read
i
was
very
much
pleased
to
see
that
they
had
taken
my
hint
about
nailing
wooden
slats
across
the
windows
of
their
poor
huts
to
prevent
the
constant
ingress
of
the
poultry
this
in
itself
will
produce
an
immense
difference
in
the
cleanliness
and
comfort
of
their
wretched
abodes
in
one
of
the
huts
i
found
a
broken
it
was
the
only
piece
of
furniture
of
the
sort
that
i
had
yet
seen
among
them
the
woman
who
owned
it
was
i
am
sorry
to
say
peculiarly
untidy
and
dirty
and
so
were
her
children
so
that
i
felt
rather
inclined
to
scoff
at
the
piece
of
civilized
vanity
which
i
should
otherwise
have
greeted
as
a
promising
sign
i
drove
home
late
in
the
afternoon
through
the
woods
that
are
beginning
to
hum
with
the
voice
of
thousands
of
insects
my
troop
of
volunteer
workmen
is
increased
to
five
five
lads
working
for
my
wages
after
they
have
done
their
task
work
and
this
evening
to
my
no
small
amazement
driver
bran
came
down
to
join
them
for
an
hour
after
working
all
day
at
five
pound
which
certainly
shows
zeal
and
energy
dear
e
i
have
been
riding
through
the
woods
all
the
morning
with
jack
giving
him
directions
about
the
clearings
which
i
have
some
faint
hope
may
be
allowed
to
continue
after
my
departure
i
went
on
an
exploring
expedition
round
some
distant
fields
and
then
home
through
the
annie
woods
they
have
almost
stripped
the
trees
and
thickets
along
the
swamp
road
since
i
first
came
here
i
wonder
what
it
is
for
not
fuel
surely
nor
to
make
grass
land
of
or
otherwise
cultivate
the
swamp
i
do
deplore
these
pitiless
clearings
and
as
to
this
once
pretty
road
it
looks
as
a
worthy
pennsylvania
farmer
wife
once
said
to
me
of
a
pretty
from
which
her
husband
had
ruthlessly
felled
a
beautiful
grove
of
trees
i
had
another
snake
encounter
in
my
ride
this
morning
just
as
i
had
walked
my
horse
through
the
swamp
and
while
contemplating
ruefully
its
naked
aspect
a
huge
black
snake
wriggled
rapidly
across
the
path
and
i
pulled
my
reins
tight
and
opened
my
mouth
wide
with
horror
these
creatures
are
i
believe
not
poisonous
but
they
grow
to
a
monstrous
size
and
have
tremendous
power
i
have
heard
stories
that
sound
like
the
nightmare
of
their
fighting
desperately
with
those
deadly
creatures
rattlesnakes
i
can
not
conceive
if
the
black
snakes
are
not
poisonous
what
chance
they
have
against
such
antagonists
let
their
squeezing
powers
be
what
they
will
how
horrid
it
did
look
over
the
road
perhaps
the
swamp
has
been
cleared
on
account
of
its
harbouring
these
dreadful
worms
i
rode
home
very
fast
in
spite
of
the
exquisite
fragrance
of
the
wild
cherry
blossoms
the
carpets
and
curtains
of
wild
flowers
among
which
a
sort
of
glorified
dandelion
glowed
conspicuously
dandelions
such
as
i
should
think
grew
in
the
garden
of
eden
if
there
were
any
at
all
there
i
passed
the
finest
magnolia
that
i
have
yet
seen
it
was
magnificent
and
i
suppose
had
been
spared
for
its
beauty
for
it
grew
in
the
very
middle
of
a
cotton
field
it
was
as
large
as
a
fine
forest
tree
and
its
huge
glittering
leaves
shone
like
plates
of
metal
in
the
sun
what
a
spectacle
that
tree
must
be
in
blossom
and
i
should
think
its
perfume
must
be
smelt
from
one
end
of
the
plantation
to
the
other
what
a
glorious
creature
which
do
you
think
ought
to
weigh
most
in
the
scale
the
delight
of
such
a
vegetable
or
the
disgust
of
the
black
animal
i
had
just
met
a
few
minutes
before
would
you
take
the
one
with
the
other
neither
would
i
have
spent
the
whole
afternoon
at
home
my
is
busily
at
work
again
sawney
one
of
them
came
to
join
it
nearly
at
not
having
got
through
his
day
task
before
in
watching
and
listening
to
these
lads
i
was
constantly
struck
with
the
insolent
tyranny
of
their
demeanour
towards
each
other
this
is
almost
a
universal
characteristic
of
the
manner
of
the
negroes
among
themselves
they
are
diabolically
cruel
to
animals
too
and
they
seem
to
me
as
a
rule
hardly
to
know
the
difference
between
truth
and
falsehood
these
detestable
qualities
which
i
constantly
hear
attributed
to
them
as
innate
and
inherent
in
their
race
appear
to
me
the
direct
result
of
their
condition
the
individual
exceptions
among
them
are
i
think
quite
as
many
as
would
be
found
under
similar
circumstances
among
the
same
number
of
white
people
in
considering
the
whole
condition
of
the
people
on
this
plantation
it
appears
to
me
that
the
principal
hardships
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
women
that
is
the
principal
physical
hardships
the
very
young
members
of
the
community
are
of
course
idle
and
neglected
the
very
very
old
idle
and
neglected
too
the
men
do
not
appear
to
me
and
lead
a
mere
animal
existence
in
itself
not
peculiarly
cruel
or
distressing
but
involving
a
constant
element
of
fear
and
uncertainty
and
the
trifling
evils
of
unrequited
labour
ignorance
the
most
profound
to
which
they
are
condemned
by
law
and
the
unutterable
injustice
which
precludes
them
from
all
the
merits
and
all
the
benefits
of
voluntary
exertion
and
the
progress
that
results
from
it
if
they
are
absolutely
unconscious
of
these
evils
then
they
are
not
very
brutes
always
barring
the
chance
of
being
given
or
sold
away
from
their
mates
or
their
young
processes
which
even
brutes
do
not
always
relish
i
am
very
much
struck
with
the
vein
of
melancholy
which
assumes
almost
a
poetical
tone
in
some
of
the
things
they
say
did
i
tell
you
of
that
poor
old
decrepid
creature
dorcas
who
came
to
beg
some
sugar
of
me
the
other
day
saying
as
she
took
up
my
watch
from
the
table
and
looked
at
it
i
need
not
look
at
this
i
have
almost
done
with
time
was
not
that
striking
from
such
a
poor
old
ignorant
crone
dear
e
this
is
the
fourth
day
that
i
have
had
a
of
lads
working
in
the
woods
for
me
after
their
task
hours
for
pay
you
can
not
think
how
zealous
and
energetic
they
are
i
daresay
the
novelty
of
the
process
pleases
them
almost
as
much
as
the
money
they
earn
i
must
say
they
quite
deserve
their
small
wages
last
night
i
received
a
present
from
f
of
a
drum
fish
which
animal
i
had
never
beheld
before
and
which
seemed
to
me
first
cousin
to
the
great
leviathan
it
is
to
be
eaten
and
is
certainly
the
biggest
fish
food
i
ever
saw
however
everything
is
in
proportion
and
the
prawns
that
came
with
it
are
upon
a
similarly
extensive
scale
this
magnificent
piscatorial
bounty
was
accompanied
by
a
profusion
of
hamilton
green
peas
really
a
munificent
supply
i
went
out
early
after
breakfast
with
jack
hunting
for
new
paths
we
rode
all
along
the
road
by
jones
creek
and
most
beautiful
it
was
we
skirted
the
plantation
burial
ground
and
a
dismal
place
it
looked
the
cattle
trampling
over
it
in
every
direction
except
where
k
had
had
an
enclosure
put
up
round
the
graves
of
two
white
men
who
had
worked
on
the
estate
they
were
strangers
and
of
course
utterly
indifferent
to
the
people
here
but
by
virtue
of
their
white
skins
their
was
protected
from
the
hoofs
of
the
cattle
while
the
parents
and
children
wives
husbands
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
poor
slaves
sleeping
beside
them
might
see
the
graves
of
those
they
loved
trampled
upon
and
browsed
over
desecrated
and
defiled
from
morning
till
night
there
is
something
intolerably
cruel
in
this
disdainful
denial
of
a
common
humanity
pursuing
these
wretches
even
when
they
are
hid
beneath
the
earth
the
day
was
exquisitely
beautiful
and
i
explored
a
new
wood
path
and
found
it
all
strewed
with
a
lovely
wild
flower
not
much
unlike
a
primrose
i
spent
the
afternoon
at
home
i
dread
going
out
twice
now
on
account
of
the
heat
and
the
sand
flies
while
i
was
sitting
by
the
window
abraham
our
cook
went
by
with
some
most
revolting
looking
part
i
think
of
the
interior
of
the
monstrous
drum
fish
of
which
i
have
told
you
i
asked
him
with
considerable
disgust
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
it
he
replied
we
coloured
people
eat
it
missis
said
i
do
you
say
we
coloured
people
missis
white
people
wo
touch
what
we
too
glad
of
said
i
because
you
are
poor
and
do
not
often
have
meat
to
eat
not
because
you
are
coloured
abraham
rich
white
folks
will
not
touch
what
poor
white
folks
are
too
glad
of
it
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
colour
and
if
there
were
white
people
here
worse
off
than
you
amazing
and
inconceivable
suggestion
i
fear
they
would
be
glad
to
eat
what
you
perhaps
would
not
touch
profound
pause
of
meditation
on
the
part
of
abraham
wound
up
by
a
considerate
missis
i
suppose
so
after
which
he
departed
with
the
horrid
looking
offal
saturday
i
took
another
ride
of
discovery
round
the
fields
by
jones
i
think
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
survey
this
estate
i
have
ridden
so
carefully
over
it
in
every
direction
but
my
rides
are
drawing
to
a
close
and
even
were
i
to
remain
here
this
must
be
the
case
unless
i
got
up
and
rode
under
the
stars
in
the
cool
of
the
night
this
afternoon
i
was
obliged
to
drive
up
to
annie
i
had
promised
the
people
several
times
that
i
would
do
so
i
went
after
dinner
and
as
late
as
i
could
and
found
very
considerable
improvement
in
the
whole
condition
of
the
place
the
houses
had
all
been
swept
and
some
of
them
actually
scoured
the
children
were
all
quite
tolerably
clean
they
had
put
slats
across
all
their
windows
and
little
chicken
gates
to
the
doors
to
keep
out
the
poultry
there
was
a
poor
woman
lying
in
one
of
the
cabins
in
a
wretched
condition
she
begged
for
a
bandage
but
i
do
not
see
of
what
great
use
that
can
be
to
her
as
long
as
she
has
to
hoe
in
the
fields
so
many
hours
a
day
which
i
can
not
prevent
returning
home
israel
undertook
to
pilot
me
across
the
cotton
fields
into
the
pine
land
and
a
more
excruciating
process
than
being
dragged
over
that
very
uneven
surface
in
that
wood
wagon
without
springs
i
did
never
endure
mitigated
and
soothed
though
it
was
by
the
literally
fascinating
account
my
charioteer
gave
me
of
the
rattlesnakes
with
which
the
place
we
drove
through
becomes
infested
as
the
heat
increases
i
can
not
say
that
his
description
of
them
though
more
demonstrative
as
far
as
regarded
his
own
horror
of
them
was
really
worse
than
that
which
g
was
giving
me
of
them
yesterday
he
said
they
were
very
numerous
and
were
found
in
every
direction
all
over
the
plantation
but
that
they
did
not
become
really
vicious
until
quite
late
in
the
summer
until
then
it
appears
that
they
generally
endeavour
to
make
off
if
one
meets
them
but
during
the
intense
heats
of
the
latter
part
of
july
and
august
they
never
think
of
escaping
but
at
any
sight
or
sound
which
they
may
consider
inimical
they
instantly
coil
themselves
for
a
spring
the
most
intolerable
proceeding
on
their
part
however
that
he
described
was
their
getting
up
into
the
trees
and
either
coiling
themselves
in
or
depending
from
the
branches
there
is
something
too
revolting
in
the
idea
of
serpents
looking
down
upon
one
from
the
shade
of
the
trees
to
which
one
may
betake
oneself
for
shelter
in
the
dreadful
heat
of
the
southern
midsummer
decidedly
i
do
not
think
the
would
be
pleasant
here
the
mocassin
snake
which
is
nearly
as
deadly
as
the
rattlesnake
abounds
all
over
the
island
in
the
evening
i
had
a
visit
from
c
and
b
who
officiates
at
our
small
island
church
the
conversation
i
had
with
these
gentlemen
was
sad
enough
they
seem
good
and
kind
and
amiable
men
and
i
have
no
doubt
are
conscientious
in
their
capacity
of
slaveholders
but
to
one
who
has
lived
outside
this
dreadful
atmosphere
the
whole
tone
of
their
discourse
has
a
morally
muffled
sound
which
one
must
hear
to
be
able
to
conceive
b
told
me
that
the
people
on
this
plantation
not
going
to
church
was
the
result
of
a
positive
order
from
k
who
had
peremptorily
forbidden
their
doing
so
and
of
course
to
have
infringed
that
order
would
have
been
to
incur
severe
corporal
chastisement
bishop
b
it
seems
had
advised
that
there
should
be
periodical
preaching
on
the
plantations
which
said
b
would
have
obviated
any
necessity
for
the
people
of
different
estates
congregating
at
any
given
point
at
stated
times
which
might
perhaps
be
objectionable
and
at
the
same
time
would
meet
the
reproach
which
was
now
beginning
to
be
directed
towards
the
southern
planters
as
a
class
of
neglecting
the
eternal
interest
of
their
dependents
but
k
had
equally
objected
to
this
he
seems
to
have
held
religious
teaching
a
mighty
dangerous
thing
and
how
right
he
was
i
have
met
with
conventional
cowardice
of
various
shades
and
shapes
in
various
societies
that
i
have
lived
in
but
anything
like
the
pervading
timidity
of
tone
which
i
find
here
on
all
subjects
but
above
all
on
that
of
the
condition
of
the
slaves
i
have
never
dreamed
of
truly
slavery
begets
slavery
and
the
perpetual
state
of
suspicion
and
apprehension
of
the
slaveholders
is
a
very
handsome
offset
to
say
the
least
of
it
against
the
fetters
and
the
lash
of
the
slaves
poor
people
one
and
all
but
especially
poor
oppressors
of
the
oppressed
the
attitude
of
these
men
is
really
pitiable
they
profess
perhaps
some
of
them
strive
to
do
so
indeed
to
consult
the
best
interests
of
their
slaves
and
yet
shrink
back
terrified
from
the
approach
of
the
slightest
intellectual
or
moral
improvement
which
might
modify
their
degraded
and
miserable
existence
i
do
pity
these
deplorable
servants
of
two
masters
more
than
any
human
beings
i
have
ever
seen
more
than
their
own
slaves
a
thousand
times
is
sunday
and
i
have
been
to
the
little
church
on
the
island
it
is
the
second
time
since
i
came
down
to
the
south
that
i
have
been
to
a
place
of
worship
a
curious
little
incident
prefaced
my
going
thither
this
morning
i
had
desired
israel
to
get
my
horse
ready
and
himself
to
accompany
me
as
i
meant
to
ride
to
church
and
you
can
not
imagine
anything
droller
than
his
horror
and
dismay
when
he
at
length
comprehended
that
my
purpose
was
to
attend
divine
service
in
my
riding
habit
i
asked
him
what
was
the
trouble
for
though
i
saw
something
was
creating
a
dreadful
convulsion
in
his
mind
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
till
he
told
me
adding
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
on
simon
in
his
life
as
who
should
say
such
a
thing
was
never
seen
in
hyde
park
or
the
tuileries
before
you
may
imagine
my
amusement
but
presently
i
was
destined
to
shock
something
much
more
serious
than
poor
israel
sense
of
convénances
et
and
it
was
not
without
something
of
an
effort
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
i
was
standing
at
the
open
window
speaking
to
him
about
the
horses
and
telling
him
to
get
ready
to
ride
with
me
when
george
another
of
the
men
went
by
with
a
shade
or
visor
to
his
cap
exactly
the
shape
of
the
one
i
left
behind
at
the
north
and
for
want
of
which
i
have
been
suffering
severely
from
the
intense
heat
and
glare
of
the
sun
for
the
last
week
i
asked
him
to
hand
me
his
cap
saying
want
to
take
the
pattern
of
that
shade
israel
exclaimed
missis
not
let
him
leave
the
cap
with
you
but
cut
pattern
on
de
sabbath
day
it
seemed
to
me
a
much
more
serious
matter
to
offend
this
scruple
than
the
prejudice
with
regard
to
praying
in
a
riding
habit
still
it
had
to
be
done
you
think
it
wrong
israel
said
i
work
on
sunday
missis
parson
tell
we
so
israel
be
sure
you
never
do
it
did
your
parson
never
tell
you
that
your
conscience
was
for
yourself
and
not
for
your
neighbours
israel
yes
missis
he
tell
we
that
too
mind
that
too
israel
the
shade
was
cut
out
and
stitched
upon
my
cap
and
protected
my
eyes
from
the
fierce
glare
of
the
sun
and
sand
as
i
rode
to
church
on
our
way
we
came
to
a
field
where
the
young
corn
was
coming
up
the
children
were
in
the
field
little
living
scarecrows
watching
it
of
course
as
on
a
weekday
to
keep
off
the
birds
i
made
israel
observe
this
who
replied
missis
if
de
people
corn
left
one
whole
day
not
watched
not
one
blade
of
it
remain
it
must
be
watched
missis
on
the
sabbath
day
israel
missis
or
else
we
lose
it
all
i
was
not
sorry
to
avail
myself
of
this
illustration
of
the
nature
of
works
of
necessity
and
proceeded
to
enlighten
israel
with
regard
to
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
genuine
observance
of
the
sabbath
you
can
not
imagine
anything
wilder
or
more
beautiful
than
the
situation
of
the
little
rustic
temple
in
the
woods
where
i
went
to
worship
with
the
magnificent
live
oaks
standing
round
it
and
its
picturesque
burial
ground
the
disgracefully
neglected
state
of
the
latter
its
broken
and
ruinous
enclosure
and
its
shaggy
graves
tell
a
strange
story
of
the
residents
of
this
island
who
are
content
to
leave
the
of
their
dead
in
so
shocking
a
condition
in
the
tiny
little
chamber
of
a
church
the
grand
old
litany
of
the
episcopal
church
of
england
was
not
a
little
shorn
of
its
ceremonial
stateliness
clerk
there
was
none
nor
choir
nor
organ
and
the
clergyman
did
duty
for
all
giving
out
the
hymn
and
then
singing
it
himself
followed
as
best
might
be
by
the
uncertain
voices
of
his
very
small
congregation
the
smallest
i
think
i
ever
saw
gathered
in
a
christian
place
of
worship
even
counting
a
few
of
the
negroes
who
had
ventured
to
place
themselves
standing
at
the
back
of
the
church
an
infringement
on
their
part
upon
the
privileges
of
their
betters
as
b
generally
preaches
a
second
sermon
to
them
after
the
service
to
which
as
a
rule
they
are
not
admitted
on
leaving
the
church
i
could
not
but
smile
at
the
quaint
and
original
costumes
with
which
israel
had
so
much
dreaded
a
comparison
for
my
irreproachable
london
riding
habit
however
the
strangeness
of
it
was
what
inspired
him
with
terror
but
at
that
rate
i
am
afraid
a
paris
gown
and
bonnet
might
have
been
in
equal
danger
of
shocking
his
prejudices
there
was
quite
as
little
affinity
with
the
one
as
the
other
in
the
curious
specimens
of
the
of
dressing
that
gradually
distributed
themselves
among
the
two
or
three
indescribable
machines
to
use
the
appropriate
scotch
title
drawn
up
under
the
beautiful
oak
trees
on
which
they
departed
in
various
directions
to
the
several
plantations
on
the
island
i
mounted
my
horse
and
resumed
my
ride
and
my
conversation
with
israel
he
told
me
that
k
great
objection
to
the
people
going
to
church
was
their
meeting
with
the
slaves
from
the
other
plantations
and
one
reason
he
added
that
he
did
not
wish
them
to
do
that
was
that
they
trafficked
and
bartered
away
the
cooper
wares
tubs
piggins
made
on
the
estate
i
think
however
from
everything
i
hear
of
that
gentleman
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
hampton
people
coming
in
contact
with
the
slaves
of
other
plantations
would
be
a
thing
he
would
have
deprecated
as
a
severe
disciplinarian
he
was
probably
right
in
the
course
of
our
talk
a
reference
i
made
to
the
bible
and
answer
that
he
could
not
read
made
me
ask
him
why
his
father
had
never
taught
any
of
his
sons
to
read
old
jacob
i
know
can
read
what
followed
i
shall
never
forget
he
began
by
giving
all
sorts
of
childish
unmeaning
excuses
and
reasons
for
never
having
tried
to
learn
became
confused
and
quite
incoherent
and
then
suddenly
stopping
and
pulling
up
his
horse
said
with
a
look
and
manner
that
went
to
my
very
heart
what
for
me
learn
to
read
me
have
no
prospect
i
rode
on
without
venturing
to
speak
to
him
again
for
a
little
while
when
i
had
recovered
from
that
remark
of
his
i
explained
to
him
that
though
indeed
in
some
respects
yet
reading
might
avail
him
much
to
better
his
condition
moral
mental
and
physical
he
listened
very
attentively
and
was
silent
for
a
minute
after
which
he
said
you
say
very
true
missis
and
me
sorry
now
me
let
de
time
pass
but
you
know
what
de
white
man
dat
goberns
de
estate
him
seem
to
like
and
favour
dat
de
people
find
out
bery
soon
and
do
it
now
massa
k
him
neber
favour
our
reading
him
not
like
it
likely
as
not
he
lick
you
if
he
find
you
reading
or
if
you
wish
to
teach
your
children
him
always
say
pooh
teach
to
read
teach
to
work
according
to
dat
we
neber
paid
much
attention
to
it
but
now
it
will
be
different
it
was
different
in
former
times
de
old
folks
of
my
father
and
mother
time
could
read
more
than
we
can
and
i
expect
de
people
will
dare
to
give
some
thought
to
it
again
now
there
a
precious
sample
of
what
one
man
influence
may
do
in
his
own
sphere
dear
e
this
man
israel
is
a
remarkably
fine
fellow
in
every
way
with
a
frank
open
and
most
intelligent
countenance
which
rises
before
me
with
its
look
of
quiet
sadness
whenever
i
think
of
those
words
and
they
haunt
me
have
no
prospect
on
my
arrival
at
home
i
found
that
a
number
of
the
people
not
knowing
i
had
gone
to
church
had
come
up
to
the
house
hoping
that
i
would
read
prayers
to
them
and
had
not
gone
back
to
their
homes
but
waited
to
see
me
i
could
not
bear
to
disappoint
them
for
many
of
them
had
come
from
the
farthest
settlements
on
the
estate
and
so
though
my
hot
ride
had
tired
me
a
good
deal
and
my
talk
with
israel
troubled
me
profoundly
i
took
off
my
habit
and
had
them
all
in
and
read
the
afternoon
service
to
them
when
it
was
over
two
of
the
women
venus
and
trussa
asked
if
they
might
be
permitted
to
go
to
the
nursery
and
see
the
children
their
account
of
the
former
condition
of
the
estate
was
a
corroboration
of
israel
they
said
that
the
older
slaves
on
the
plantation
had
been
far
better
off
than
the
younger
ones
of
the
present
day
that
major
was
considerate
and
humane
to
his
people
and
that
the
women
were
especially
carefully
treated
but
they
said
k
had
ruined
all
the
young
women
with
working
them
too
soon
after
their
confinements
and
as
for
the
elder
ones
he
would
kick
them
curse
them
turn
their
clothes
over
their
heads
flog
them
unmercifully
himself
and
abuse
them
shamefully
no
matter
what
condition
they
were
in
they
both
ended
with
fervent
thanks
to
god
that
he
had
left
the
estate
and
rejoicing
that
we
had
come
and
above
all
that
we
made
young
missis
for
them
venus
went
down
on
her
knees
exclaiming
missis
i
glad
now
and
when
i
am
dead
i
glad
in
my
grave
that
you
come
to
us
and
bring
us
little
missis
dear
e
i
still
go
on
exploring
or
rather
surveying
the
estate
the
aspect
of
which
is
changing
every
day
with
the
unfolding
of
the
leaves
and
the
wonderful
profusion
of
wild
flowers
the
cleared
ground
all
round
the
new
building
is
one
sheet
of
blooming
blue
of
various
tints
it
is
perfectly
exquisite
but
in
the
midst
of
my
delight
at
these
new
blossoms
i
am
most
sorrowfully
bidding
adieu
to
that
paragon
of
parasites
the
yellow
jasmine
i
think
i
must
have
gathered
the
very
last
blossoms
of
it
nothing
can
be
more
lovely
nothing
so
exquisitely
fragrant
i
was
surprised
to
recognise
by
their
foliage
some
fine
mulberry
trees
by
jones
creek
perhaps
they
are
the
remains
of
the
experiment
that
c
persuaded
major
to
try
so
ineffectually
while
i
was
looking
at
some
wild
plum
and
cherry
trees
that
were
already
swarming
with
blight
in
the
shape
of
multitudinous
caterpillars
nests
an
ingenuous
darkie
by
name
cudgie
asked
me
if
i
could
explain
to
him
why
the
trees
blossomed
out
so
fair
and
then
all
off
into
a
kind
of
dying
having
directed
his
vision
and
attention
to
the
horrid
white
glistening
webs
all
lined
with
their
brood
of
black
devourers
i
left
him
to
draw
his
own
conclusions
the
afternoon
was
rainy
in
spite
of
which
i
drove
to
busson
hill
and
had
a
talk
with
bran
about
the
vile
caterpillar
blights
on
the
wild
plum
trees
and
asked
him
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
get
some
sweet
grafts
from
c
for
some
of
the
wild
fruit
trees
of
which
there
are
such
quantities
perhaps
however
they
are
not
worth
grafting
bran
promised
me
that
the
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
encumber
the
paths
and
the
front
of
their
houses
with
unsightly
and
untidy
heaps
of
oyster
shells
he
promised
all
sorts
of
things
i
wonder
how
soon
after
i
am
gone
they
will
all
return
into
the
condition
of
brutal
filth
and
disorder
in
which
i
found
them
the
men
and
women
had
done
their
work
here
by
three
the
chief
labour
in
the
cotton
fields
however
is
both
earlier
and
later
in
the
season
at
present
they
have
little
to
do
but
let
the
crop
grow
in
the
evening
i
had
a
visit
from
the
son
of
a
very
remarkable
man
who
had
been
one
of
the
chief
drivers
on
the
estate
in
major
time
and
his
son
brought
me
a
silver
cup
which
major
had
given
his
father
as
a
testimonial
of
approbation
with
an
inscription
on
it
recording
his
fidelity
and
trustworthiness
at
the
time
of
the
invasion
of
the
coast
of
georgia
by
the
english
troops
was
not
that
a
curious
reward
for
a
slave
who
was
supposed
not
to
be
able
to
read
his
own
praises
and
yet
from
the
honourable
pride
with
which
his
son
regarded
this
relic
i
am
sure
the
master
did
well
so
to
reward
his
servant
though
it
seemed
hard
that
the
son
of
such
a
man
should
be
a
slave
maurice
himself
came
with
his
father
precious
silver
cup
in
his
hand
to
beg
for
a
small
pittance
of
sugar
and
for
a
and
also
to
know
if
the
privilege
of
a
milch
cow
for
the
support
of
his
family
which
was
among
the
favours
major
allowed
his
father
might
not
be
continued
to
him
he
told
me
he
had
ten
children
for
massa
and
i
promised
to
mention
his
petition
to
on
sunday
last
i
rode
round
the
woods
near
annie
and
met
with
a
monstrous
snake
which
jack
called
a
chicken
snake
but
whether
because
it
particularly
affected
poultry
as
its
diet
or
for
what
other
reason
he
could
not
tell
me
nearer
home
i
encountered
another
gliding
creature
that
stopped
a
moment
just
in
front
of
my
horse
feet
as
if
it
was
too
much
afraid
of
being
trampled
upon
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
was
the
only
snake
animal
i
ever
saw
that
i
did
not
think
hideous
it
was
of
a
perfectly
pure
apple
green
colour
with
a
delicate
line
of
black
like
a
collar
round
its
throat
it
really
was
an
exquisite
worm
and
jack
said
it
was
harmless
i
did
not
however
think
it
expedient
to
bring
it
home
in
my
bosom
though
if
ever
i
have
a
pet
snake
it
shall
be
such
an
one
in
the
afternoon
i
drove
to
jones
with
several
supplies
of
flannel
for
the
rheumatic
women
and
old
men
we
have
ridden
over
to
hamilton
again
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
f
s
and
on
our
way
passed
an
enormous
rattlesnake
hanging
dead
on
the
bough
of
a
tree
dead
as
it
was
it
turned
me
perfectly
sick
with
horror
and
i
wished
very
much
to
come
back
to
the
north
immediately
where
these
are
not
the
sort
of
blackberries
that
grow
on
every
bush
the
evening
air
now
after
the
heat
of
the
day
is
exquisitely
mild
and
the
nights
dry
and
wholesome
the
whole
atmosphere
indescribably
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
as
i
stood
before
going
to
bed
last
night
watching
the
slow
revolving
light
on
sapelo
island
that
warns
the
ships
from
the
dangerous
bar
at
the
river
mouth
and
heard
the
measured
pulse
of
the
great
atlantic
waters
on
the
beach
i
thought
no
more
of
rattlesnakes
no
more
for
one
short
while
of
slavery
how
still
and
sweet
and
solemn
it
was
we
have
been
paying
more
friendly
and
neighbourly
visits
or
rather
returning
them
and
the
recipients
of
these
civilised
courtesies
on
our
last
calling
expedition
were
the
family
one
member
of
which
was
a
party
concerned
in
that
barbarous
challenge
i
wrote
you
word
about
hitherto
that
very
brutal
and
bloodthirsty
cartel
appears
to
have
had
no
result
you
must
not
on
that
account
imagine
that
it
will
have
none
at
the
north
were
it
possible
for
a
duel
intended
to
be
conducted
on
such
savage
terms
to
be
matter
of
notoriety
the
very
horror
of
the
thing
would
create
a
feeling
of
grotesqueness
and
the
antagonists
in
such
a
proposed
encounter
would
simply
incur
an
immense
amount
of
ridicule
and
obloquy
but
here
nobody
is
astonished
and
nobody
ashamed
of
such
preliminaries
to
a
mortal
combat
between
two
gentlemen
who
propose
firing
at
marks
over
each
other
hearts
and
cutting
off
each
other
heads
and
though
this
agreeable
party
of
pleasure
has
not
come
off
yet
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
it
should
not
at
the
first
convenient
season
reflecting
upon
all
which
i
rode
not
without
trepidation
through
colonel
h
grounds
and
up
to
his
house
w
head
was
not
stuck
upon
a
pole
anywhere
within
sight
however
and
as
soon
as
i
became
pretty
sure
of
this
i
began
to
look
about
me
and
saw
instead
a
trellis
tapestried
with
the
most
beautiful
roses
i
ever
beheld
another
of
these
exquisite
southern
flowers
the
cherokee
rose
the
blossom
is
very
large
composed
of
four
or
five
pure
white
petals
as
white
and
as
large
as
those
of
the
finest
camellia
with
a
bright
golden
eye
for
a
focus
the
buds
and
leaves
are
long
and
elegantly
slender
like
those
of
some
tea
roses
and
the
green
of
the
foliage
is
dark
and
at
the
same
time
vivid
and
lustrous
it
grew
in
masses
so
as
to
form
almost
a
hedge
all
starred
with
these
wonderful
white
blossoms
which
unfortunately
have
no
perfume
we
rode
home
through
the
pine
land
to
jones
looked
at
the
new
house
which
is
coming
on
hideously
saw
two
beautiful
kinds
of
trumpet
honeysuckle
already
lighting
up
the
woods
in
every
direction
with
gleams
of
scarlet
and
when
we
reached
home
found
a
splendid
donation
of
vegetables
flowers
and
mutton
from
our
kind
neighbour
f
who
is
a
perfect
lady
bountiful
to
us
this
same
mutton
however
my
heart
bleeds
to
say
it
disappeared
the
day
after
it
was
sent
to
us
abraham
the
cook
declares
that
he
locked
the
door
of
the
safe
upon
it
which
i
think
may
be
true
but
i
also
think
he
unlocked
it
again
i
am
sorry
but
after
all
it
is
very
natural
these
people
should
steal
a
little
of
our
meat
from
us
occasionally
who
steal
almost
all
their
bread
from
them
habitually
i
rode
yesterday
to
annie
with
we
found
a
whole
tract
of
marsh
had
been
set
on
fire
by
the
facetious
negro
called
pun
who
had
helped
me
out
of
it
some
time
ago
as
he
was
set
to
work
in
it
perhaps
it
was
with
a
view
of
making
it
less
damp
at
any
rate
it
was
crackling
blazing
and
smoking
cheerily
and
i
should
think
would
be
insupportable
for
the
snakes
while
stopping
to
look
at
the
conflagration
was
accosted
by
a
three
parts
naked
and
one
part
tattered
little
she
slave
black
as
ebony
where
her
skin
was
discoverable
through
its
perfect
incrustation
of
dirt
with
a
thick
mat
of
frizzly
wool
upon
her
skull
which
made
the
sole
request
she
preferred
to
him
irresistibly
ludicrous
massa
you
please
to
buy
me
a
comb
to
tick
in
my
head
promised
her
this
necessary
of
life
and
i
promised
myself
to
give
her
the
luxury
of
one
whole
garment
has
sent
me
the
best
possible
consolation
for
the
lost
mutton
some
lovely
flowers
and
these
will
not
be
stolen
the
dear
e
i
rode
through
all
my
woodpaths
for
the
last
time
with
jack
and
i
think
i
should
have
felt
quite
melancholy
at
taking
leave
of
them
and
him
but
for
the
apparition
of
a
large
black
snake
which
filled
me
with
disgust
and
nipped
my
other
sentiments
in
the
bud
not
a
day
passes
now
that
i
do
not
encounter
one
or
more
of
these
hateful
reptiles
it
is
curious
how
much
more
odious
they
are
to
me
than
the
alligators
that
haunt
the
mud
banks
of
the
river
round
the
rice
plantation
it
is
true
that
there
is
something
very
dreadful
in
the
thick
shapeless
mass
uniform
in
colour
almost
to
the
black
slime
on
which
it
lies
basking
and
which
you
hardly
detect
till
it
begins
to
move
but
even
those
ungainly
crocodiles
never
sickened
me
as
those
rapid
lithe
and
sinuous
serpents
do
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
the
people
at
the
rice
plantation
caught
a
young
alligator
and
brought
it
to
the
house
and
it
was
kept
for
some
time
in
a
tub
of
water
it
was
an
little
monster
it
used
to
set
up
its
back
like
a
cat
when
it
was
angry
and
open
its
long
jaws
in
a
most
vicious
manner
after
looking
at
my
new
path
in
the
pine
land
i
crossed
pike
bluff
and
breaking
my
way
all
through
the
burnt
district
returned
home
by
jones
in
the
afternoon
we
paid
a
long
visit
to
c
it
is
extremely
interesting
to
me
to
talk
with
him
about
the
negroes
he
has
spent
so
much
of
his
life
among
them
has
managed
them
so
humanely
and
apparently
so
successfully
that
his
experience
is
worthy
of
all
attention
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
impossible
or
rather
perhaps
for
those
very
reasons
it
is
impossible
for
him
ever
to
contemplate
them
in
any
condition
but
that
of
slavery
he
thinks
them
very
like
the
irish
and
instanced
their
subserviency
their
flattering
their
lying
and
pilfering
as
traits
common
to
the
character
of
both
peoples
but
i
can
not
persuade
myself
that
in
both
cases
and
certainly
in
that
of
the
negroes
these
qualities
are
not
in
great
measure
the
result
of
their
condition
he
says
that
he
considers
the
extremely
low
diet
of
the
negroes
one
reason
for
the
absence
of
crimes
of
a
savage
nature
among
them
most
of
them
do
not
touch
meat
the
year
round
but
in
this
respect
they
certainly
do
not
resemble
the
irish
who
contrive
upon
about
as
low
a
national
diet
as
civilisation
is
acquainted
with
to
commit
the
bloodiest
and
most
frequent
outrages
with
which
civilisation
has
to
deal
his
statement
that
it
is
impossible
to
bribe
the
negroes
to
work
on
their
own
account
with
any
steadiness
may
be
generally
true
but
admits
of
quite
exceptions
enough
to
throw
doubt
upon
its
being
natural
supineness
in
the
race
rather
than
the
inevitable
consequence
of
denying
them
the
entire
right
to
labour
for
their
own
profit
their
laziness
seems
to
me
the
necessary
result
of
their
primary
wants
being
supplied
and
all
progress
denied
them
of
course
if
the
natural
spur
to
exertion
necessity
is
removed
you
do
away
with
the
will
to
work
of
a
vast
proportion
of
all
who
do
work
in
the
world
it
is
the
law
of
progress
that
a
man
necessities
grow
with
his
exertions
to
satisfy
them
and
labour
and
improvement
thus
continually
act
and
react
upon
each
other
to
raise
the
scale
of
desire
and
achievement
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
majority
of
instances
among
any
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
will
to
labour
for
small
indulgences
would
survive
the
loss
of
freedom
and
the
security
of
food
enough
to
exist
upon
said
that
he
had
offered
a
bribe
of
twenty
dollars
apiece
and
the
use
of
a
pair
of
oxen
for
the
clearing
of
a
certain
piece
of
land
to
the
men
on
his
estate
and
found
the
offer
quite
ineffectual
to
procure
the
desired
result
the
land
was
subsequently
cleared
as
usual
task
work
under
the
lash
now
certainly
we
have
among
people
instances
of
men
who
have
made
very
considerable
sums
of
money
by
in
their
leisure
hours
and
the
instances
of
almost
persevering
stringent
labour
by
which
slaves
have
at
length
purchased
their
own
freedom
and
that
of
their
wives
and
children
are
on
record
in
numbers
sufficient
to
prove
that
they
are
capable
of
severe
sustained
effort
of
the
most
patient
and
heroic
kind
for
that
great
object
liberty
for
my
own
part
i
know
no
people
who
doat
upon
labour
for
its
own
sake
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
natural
to
any
absolutely
ignorant
and
nearly
brutish
man
if
you
say
to
him
effort
of
your
own
can
make
you
free
but
no
absence
of
effort
shall
starve
you
to
decline
to
work
for
anything
less
than
mastery
over
his
whole
life
and
to
take
up
with
his
mess
of
porridge
as
the
alternative
one
thing
that
said
seemed
to
me
to
prove
rather
too
much
he
declared
that
his
son
objecting
to
the
folks
on
his
plantation
going
about
had
at
one
time
offered
a
reward
of
a
dollar
to
those
who
should
habitually
wear
hats
without
being
able
to
induce
them
to
do
so
which
he
attributed
to
sheer
careless
indolence
but
i
think
it
was
merely
the
force
of
the
habit
of
going
uncovered
rather
than
absolute
laziness
the
universal
testimony
of
all
present
at
this
conversation
was
in
favour
of
the
sweetness
of
temper
and
natural
gentleness
of
disposition
of
the
negroes
but
these
characteristics
they
seemed
to
think
less
inherent
than
the
result
of
diet
and
the
other
lowering
influences
of
their
condition
and
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
on
the
estate
of
this
wise
and
kind
master
a
formidable
conspiracy
was
organised
among
his
slaves
we
rowed
home
through
a
world
of
stars
the
stedfast
ones
set
in
the
still
blue
sky
and
the
flashing
swathes
of
phosphoric
light
turned
up
by
our
oars
and
keel
in
the
smooth
blue
water
it
was
lovely
my
dear
e
that
horrid
tragedy
with
which
we
have
been
threatened
and
of
which
i
was
writing
to
you
almost
jestingly
a
few
days
ago
has
been
accomplished
and
apparently
without
exciting
anything
but
the
most
passing
and
superficial
sensation
in
this
community
the
duel
between
h
and
w
did
not
take
place
but
an
accidental
encounter
in
the
hotel
at
brunswick
did
and
the
former
shot
the
latter
dead
on
the
spot
he
has
been
brought
home
and
buried
here
by
the
little
church
close
to
his
mother
plantation
and
the
murderer
if
he
is
even
prosecuted
runs
no
risk
of
finding
a
jury
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
georgia
who
could
convict
him
of
anything
it
is
horrible
i
drove
to
church
in
the
wood
wagon
with
jack
and
aleck
hector
being
our
charioteer
in
a
gilt
and
pair
of
slippers
to
match
as
the
sabbatic
part
of
his
attire
the
love
of
dirty
finery
is
not
a
trait
of
the
irish
in
ireland
but
i
think
it
crops
out
strongly
when
they
come
out
here
and
the
proportion
of
their
high
wages
put
upon
their
backs
by
the
young
irish
in
the
north
indicates
a
strong
addiction
to
the
female
passion
for
dress
here
the
tendency
seems
to
exist
in
men
and
women
alike
but
i
think
all
savage
men
rejoice
even
more
than
their
women
in
personal
ornamentation
the
negroes
certainly
show
the
same
strong
predilection
for
finery
with
their
womenkind
i
stopped
before
going
into
church
to
look
at
the
new
grave
that
has
taken
its
place
among
the
defaced
stones
all
overgrown
with
briers
that
lie
round
it
poor
young
w
poor
widowed
mother
of
whom
he
was
the
only
son
what
a
savage
horror
and
no
one
seems
to
think
anything
of
it
more
than
of
a
matter
of
course
my
devotions
were
anything
but
satisfactory
or
refreshing
to
me
my
mind
was
dwelling
incessantly
upon
the
new
grave
under
the
great
oaks
outside
and
the
miserable
mother
in
her
home
the
air
of
the
church
was
perfectly
thick
with
and
the
disgraceful
carelessness
of
the
congregation
in
responding
and
singing
the
hymns
and
their
entire
neglect
of
the
regulations
for
kneeling
disturbed
and
displeased
me
even
more
than
the
last
time
i
was
at
church
but
i
think
that
was
because
of
the
total
absence
of
excitement
or
feeling
among
the
whole
population
of
simon
upon
the
subject
of
the
bloody
outrage
with
which
my
mind
was
full
which
has
given
me
a
sensation
of
horror
towards
the
whole
community
just
imagine
only
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
such
a
thing
taking
place
in
a
new
england
village
the
dismay
the
grief
the
shame
the
indignation
that
would
fill
the
hearts
of
the
whole
population
i
thought
we
should
surely
have
some
reference
to
the
event
from
the
pulpit
some
lesson
of
christian
command
over
furious
passions
nothing
nobody
looked
or
spoke
as
if
anything
unusual
had
occurred
and
i
left
the
church
rejoicing
to
think
that
i
was
going
away
from
such
a
dreadful
state
of
society
b
remained
to
preach
a
second
sermon
to
the
negroes
the
duty
of
submission
to
masters
who
intermurder
each
other
i
had
service
at
home
in
the
afternoon
and
my
congregation
was
much
more
crowded
than
usual
for
i
believe
there
is
no
doubt
at
last
that
we
shall
leave
georgia
this
week
having
given
way
so
much
before
when
i
thought
i
was
praying
with
these
poor
people
for
the
last
time
i
suppose
i
had
so
to
speak
expended
my
emotion
and
i
was
much
more
composed
and
quiet
than
when
i
took
leave
of
them
before
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
dreadful
act
of
slaughter
done
in
our
neighbourhood
by
one
man
of
our
acquaintance
upon
another
impresses
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
can
hardly
turn
my
mind
from
it
and
w
and
her
poor
young
murdered
son
have
taken
almost
complete
possession
of
my
thoughts
after
prayers
i
gave
my
poor
people
a
parting
admonition
and
many
charges
to
remember
me
and
all
i
had
tried
to
teach
them
during
my
stay
they
promised
with
one
voice
to
mind
and
do
all
that
tell
we
and
with
many
a
parting
benediction
and
entreaties
to
me
to
return
they
went
their
way
i
think
i
have
done
what
i
could
for
them
i
think
i
have
done
as
well
as
i
could
by
them
but
when
the
time
comes
for
ending
any
human
relation
who
can
be
without
their
misgivings
who
can
be
bold
to
say
i
could
have
done
no
more
i
could
have
done
no
better
in
the
afternoon
i
walked
out
and
passed
many
of
the
people
who
are
now
beginning
whenever
they
see
me
to
say
bye
missis
which
is
rather
trying
many
of
them
were
clean
and
tidy
and
decent
in
their
appearance
to
a
degree
that
certainly
bore
strong
witness
to
the
temporary
efficacy
of
my
influence
in
this
respect
there
is
however
of
course
much
individual
difference
even
with
reference
to
this
and
some
take
much
more
kindly
and
readily
to
cleanliness
no
doubt
to
godliness
too
than
some
others
i
met
abraham
and
thought
that
in
a
quiet
and
with
the
pathetic
consideration
of
my
near
departure
to
assist
me
i
could
get
him
to
confess
the
truth
about
the
disappearance
of
the
mutton
but
he
persisted
in
the
legend
of
its
departure
through
the
locked
door
and
as
i
was
only
heaping
sins
on
his
soul
with
every
lie
i
caused
him
to
add
to
the
previous
ones
i
desisted
from
my
enquiries
dirt
and
lying
are
the
natural
tendencies
of
humanity
which
are
especially
fostered
by
slavery
slaves
may
be
infinitely
wrong
and
yet
it
is
very
hard
to
blame
them
i
returned
home
finding
the
heat
quite
oppressive
late
in
the
evening
when
the
sun
had
gone
down
a
long
time
i
thought
i
would
try
and
breathe
the
fresh
sea
air
but
the
atmosphere
was
thick
with
which
drove
me
in
at
last
from
standing
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
atlantic
on
little
simon
island
the
wooded
belt
that
fends
off
the
ocean
surges
from
the
north
side
of
great
simon
it
is
a
wild
little
covered
with
thick
forest
growth
and
belongs
to
i
have
long
had
a
great
desire
to
visit
it
i
hope
yet
to
be
able
to
do
so
before
our
departure
i
have
just
finished
reading
with
the
utmost
interest
and
admiration
j
c
narrative
of
his
escape
from
the
wreck
of
the
poolaski
what
a
brave
and
gallant
and
unselfish
soul
he
must
be
you
never
read
anything
more
thrilling
in
spite
of
the
perfect
modesty
of
this
account
of
his
if
i
can
obtain
his
permission
and
squeeze
out
the
time
i
will
surely
copy
it
for
you
the
quiet
unassuming
character
of
his
usual
manners
and
deportment
adds
greatly
to
his
prestige
as
a
hero
what
a
fine
thing
it
must
be
to
be
such
a
man
dear
e
we
shall
leave
this
place
next
thursday
or
friday
and
there
will
be
an
end
to
this
record
meantime
i
am
fulfilling
all
sorts
of
last
duties
and
especially
those
of
taking
leave
of
my
neighbours
by
whom
the
neglect
of
a
farewell
visit
would
be
taken
much
amiss
on
sunday
i
rode
to
a
place
called
frederica
to
call
on
a
a
who
came
to
see
me
some
time
ago
i
rode
straight
through
the
island
by
the
main
road
that
leads
to
the
little
church
how
can
i
describe
to
you
the
exquisite
spring
beauty
that
is
now
adorning
these
woods
the
variety
of
the
fresh
foliage
the
fragrance
of
the
sweet
wild
perfumes
that
fill
the
air
honeysuckles
twine
round
every
tree
the
ground
is
covered
with
a
low
shrub
more
fragrant
than
lilies
of
the
valley
the
accacuas
are
swinging
their
silver
censers
under
the
green
roof
of
these
wood
temples
every
stump
is
like
a
classical
altar
to
the
sylvan
gods
garlanded
with
flowers
every
post
or
stick
or
slight
stem
like
a
bacchante
thyrsus
twined
with
wreaths
of
ivy
and
wild
vine
waving
in
the
tepid
wind
beautiful
butterflies
flicker
like
flying
flowers
among
the
bushes
and
gorgeous
birds
like
winged
jewels
dart
from
the
boughs
and
and
a
huge
ground
snake
slid
like
a
dark
ribbon
across
the
path
while
i
was
stopping
to
enjoy
all
this
deliciousness
and
so
i
became
less
enthusiastic
and
cantered
on
past
the
little
deserted
churchyard
with
the
grave
beneath
its
grove
of
noble
oaks
and
a
little
farther
on
reached
a
cottage
half
hidden
in
the
midst
of
ruins
and
roses
this
frederica
is
a
very
strange
place
it
was
once
a
town
town
the
metropolis
of
the
island
the
english
when
they
landed
on
the
coast
of
georgia
in
the
war
destroyed
this
tiny
place
and
it
has
never
been
built
up
again
a
and
one
other
house
are
the
only
dwellings
that
remain
in
this
curious
wilderness
of
dismantled
crumbling
grey
walls
compassionately
cloaked
with
a
thousand
profuse
and
graceful
creepers
these
are
the
only
ruins
properly
so
called
except
those
of
fort
putnam
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
this
land
of
contemptuous
youth
i
hailed
these
picturesque
groups
and
masses
with
the
feelings
of
a
european
to
whom
ruins
are
like
a
sort
of
relations
in
my
country
ruins
are
like
a
minor
chord
in
music
here
they
are
like
a
discord
they
are
not
the
relics
of
time
but
the
results
of
violence
they
recall
no
valuable
memories
of
a
remote
past
and
are
mere
encumbrances
to
the
busy
present
evidently
they
are
out
of
place
in
america
except
on
simon
island
between
this
savage
selvage
of
civilisation
and
the
great
atlantic
deep
these
heaps
of
rubbish
and
roses
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
a
sketcher
but
i
imagine
the
snakes
have
it
all
to
themselves
here
and
are
undisturbed
by
camp
stools
white
umbrellas
and
ejaculatory
young
ladies
i
sat
for
a
long
time
with
a
and
a
friend
of
hers
staying
with
her
a
a
lately
from
florida
the
latter
seemed
to
me
a
remarkable
woman
her
conversation
was
extremely
interesting
she
had
been
stopping
at
brunswick
at
the
hotel
where
h
murdered
young
w
and
said
that
the
mingled
ferocity
and
blackguardism
of
the
men
who
frequented
the
house
had
induced
her
to
cut
short
her
stay
there
and
come
on
to
her
friend
a
we
spoke
of
that
terrible
crime
which
had
occurred
only
the
day
after
she
left
brunswick
and
both
ladies
agreed
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
h
being
punished
in
any
way
for
the
murder
he
had
committed
that
shooting
down
a
man
who
had
offended
you
was
part
of
the
morals
and
manners
of
the
southern
gentry
and
that
the
circumstance
was
one
of
quite
too
frequent
occurrence
to
cause
any
sensation
even
in
the
small
community
where
it
obliterated
one
of
the
principal
members
of
the
society
if
the
accounts
given
by
these
ladies
of
the
character
of
the
planters
in
this
part
of
the
south
may
be
believed
they
must
be
as
idle
arrogant
ignorant
dissolute
and
ferocious
as
that
mediaeval
chivalry
to
which
they
are
fond
of
comparing
themselves
and
these
are
southern
women
and
should
know
the
people
among
whom
they
live
we
had
a
long
discussion
on
the
subject
of
slavery
and
they
took
as
usual
the
old
ground
of
justifying
the
system
it
was
administered
with
kindness
and
indulgence
it
is
not
surprising
that
women
should
regard
the
question
from
this
point
of
view
they
are
very
seldom
and
are
generally
treated
with
more
indulgence
than
justice
by
men
they
were
very
patient
of
my
strong
expressions
of
reprobation
of
the
whole
system
and
a
bidding
me
said
that
for
aught
she
could
tell
i
might
be
right
and
might
have
been
led
down
here
by
providence
to
be
the
means
of
some
great
change
in
the
condition
of
the
poor
coloured
people
i
rode
home
pondering
on
the
strange
fate
that
has
brought
me
to
this
place
so
far
from
where
i
was
born
this
existence
so
different
in
all
its
elements
from
that
of
my
early
years
and
former
associations
if
i
believed
a
parting
words
i
might
perhaps
verify
them
perhaps
i
may
yet
verify
although
i
do
not
believe
them
on
my
return
home
i
found
a
most
enchanting
bundle
of
flowers
sent
to
me
by
g
pomegranate
blossoms
roses
honeysuckle
everything
that
blooms
two
months
later
with
us
in
pennsylvania
i
told
you
i
had
a
great
desire
to
visit
little
simon
and
the
day
before
yesterday
i
determined
to
make
an
exploring
expedition
thither
i
took
m
and
the
children
little
imagining
what
manner
of
day
work
was
before
me
six
men
rowed
us
in
the
and
israel
brought
the
wood
wagon
after
us
in
a
flat
our
navigation
was
a
very
intricate
one
all
through
sea
swamps
and
marshes
and
with
great
white
shells
and
bleaching
bones
stuck
upon
sticks
to
mark
the
channel
we
landed
on
this
forest
in
the
sea
by
quash
house
the
only
human
residence
on
the
island
it
was
larger
and
better
and
more
substantial
than
the
negro
huts
in
general
and
he
seemed
proud
and
pleased
to
do
the
honours
to
us
thence
we
set
off
by
my
desire
in
the
wagon
through
the
woods
to
the
beach
road
there
was
none
save
the
rough
clearing
that
the
men
cut
with
their
axes
before
us
as
we
went
slowly
on
presently
we
came
to
a
deep
dry
ditch
over
which
there
was
no
visible
means
of
proceeding
israel
told
me
if
we
would
sit
still
he
would
undertake
to
drive
the
wagon
into
and
out
of
it
and
so
indeed
he
did
but
how
he
did
it
is
more
than
i
can
explain
to
you
now
or
could
explain
to
myself
then
a
less
powerful
creature
than
montreal
could
never
have
dragged
us
through
and
when
we
presently
came
to
a
second
rather
worse
edition
of
the
same
i
insisted
upon
getting
out
and
crossing
it
on
foot
i
walked
half
a
mile
while
the
wagon
was
dragged
up
and
down
the
deep
gulley
and
lifted
bodily
over
some
huge
trunks
of
fallen
trees
the
wood
through
which
we
now
drove
was
all
on
fire
smoking
flaming
crackling
and
burning
round
us
the
sun
glared
upon
us
from
the
cloudless
sky
and
the
air
was
one
cloud
of
and
mosquitoes
i
covered
both
my
children
faces
with
veils
and
handkerchiefs
and
repented
not
a
little
in
my
own
breast
of
the
rashness
of
my
undertaking
the
back
of
israel
coat
was
covered
so
thick
with
mosquitoes
that
one
could
hardly
see
the
cloth
and
i
felt
as
if
we
should
be
stifled
if
our
way
lay
much
longer
through
this
terrible
wood
presently
we
came
to
another
impassable
place
and
again
got
out
of
the
wagon
leaving
israel
to
manage
it
as
best
he
could
i
walked
with
the
baby
in
my
arms
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
was
so
overcome
with
the
heat
that
i
sat
down
in
the
burning
wood
on
the
floor
of
ashes
till
the
wagon
came
up
again
i
put
the
children
and
m
into
it
and
continued
to
walk
till
we
came
to
a
ditch
in
a
tract
of
salt
marsh
over
which
israel
drove
triumphantly
and
i
partly
jumped
and
was
partly
hauled
over
having
declined
the
entreaties
of
several
of
the
men
to
let
them
lie
down
and
make
a
bridge
with
their
bodies
for
me
to
walk
over
at
length
we
reached
the
skirt
of
that
tremendous
wood
to
my
unspeakable
relief
and
came
upon
the
white
sand
hillocks
of
the
beach
the
trees
were
all
strained
crooked
from
the
constant
influence
of
the
the
coast
was
a
stretch
of
dismal
trackless
sand
and
the
ocean
lay
boundless
and
awful
beyond
the
wild
and
desolate
beach
from
which
we
were
now
only
divided
by
a
patch
of
low
bush
growing
as
thick
and
tangled
as
heather
and
so
stiff
and
compact
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
drive
through
it
yet
in
spite
of
this
several
lads
who
had
joined
our
train
rushed
off
into
it
in
search
of
rabbits
though
israel
called
repeatedly
to
them
warning
them
of
the
danger
of
rattlesnakes
we
drove
at
last
down
to
the
smooth
sea
sand
and
here
outstripping
our
guides
was
barred
farther
progress
by
a
deep
gully
down
which
it
was
impossible
to
take
the
wagon
israel
not
knowing
the
beach
well
was
afraid
to
drive
round
the
mouth
of
it
and
so
it
was
determined
that
from
this
point
we
should
walk
home
under
his
guidance
i
sat
in
the
wagon
while
he
constructed
a
rough
of
bits
of
wood
and
broken
planks
for
us
over
the
narrow
chasm
and
he
then
took
montreal
out
of
the
wagon
and
tied
him
behind
it
leaving
him
for
the
other
men
to
take
charge
of
when
they
should
arrive
at
this
point
and
so
having
mightily
desired
to
see
the
coast
of
little
simon
island
i
did
see
it
thoroughly
for
i
walked
a
mile
and
a
half
round
it
over
beds
of
sharp
shells
through
swamps
half
knee
deep
poor
little
s
stumping
along
with
dogged
heroism
and
israel
carrying
the
baby
except
at
one
deep
when
i
took
the
baby
and
he
carried
s
and
so
through
the
wood
round
quash
house
where
we
arrived
almost
fainting
with
fatigue
and
heat
and
where
we
rested
but
a
short
time
for
we
had
to
start
almost
immediately
to
save
the
tide
home
i
called
at
c
on
my
way
back
to
return
him
his
manuscript
which
i
had
in
the
boat
for
that
purpose
i
sent
jack
who
had
come
to
meet
me
with
the
horses
home
being
too
tired
to
attempt
riding
and
covered
with
mud
literally
up
to
my
knees
i
was
obliged
to
lie
down
ignominiously
all
the
afternoon
to
rest
and
now
i
will
give
you
a
curious
illustration
of
the
utter
subserviency
of
slaves
it
seems
that
by
taking
the
tide
in
proper
season
and
going
by
boat
all
that
horrible
wood
journey
might
have
been
avoided
and
we
could
have
reached
the
beach
with
perfect
ease
in
half
the
time
but
because
being
of
course
absolutely
ignorant
of
this
i
had
expressed
a
desire
to
go
through
the
wood
not
a
syllable
of
remonstrance
was
uttered
by
any
one
and
the
men
not
only
underwent
the
labour
of
cutting
a
path
for
the
wagon
and
dragging
it
through
and
over
all
the
impediments
we
encountered
but
allowed
me
and
the
children
to
traverse
that
burning
wood
rather
than
tell
me
that
by
waiting
and
taking
another
way
i
could
get
to
the
sea
when
i
expressed
my
astonishment
at
their
not
having
remonstrated
against
my
order
and
explained
how
i
could
best
achieve
the
purpose
i
had
in
view
the
sole
answer
i
got
even
from
israel
was
say
so
so
me
do
missis
say
me
go
through
the
wood
me
no
tell
missis
go
another
way
you
see
my
dear
e
one
had
need
bethink
oneself
what
orders
one
gives
when
one
has
the
misfortune
to
be
despotic
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
return
that
narrative
of
c
without
asking
permission
to
copy
it
which
i
did
not
do
because
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
find
the
time
to
do
it
we
go
away
the
day
after
all
the
main
incidents
of
the
disaster
the
newspapers
have
made
you
familiar
with
the
sudden
and
appalling
loss
of
that
fine
vessel
laden
with
the
very
flower
of
the
south
there
seems
hardly
to
be
a
family
in
georgia
and
south
carolina
that
had
not
some
of
its
members
on
board
that
ship
you
know
it
was
a
sort
of
party
of
pleasure
more
than
anything
else
the
usual
annual
trip
to
the
north
for
change
of
air
and
scene
for
the
gaieties
of
newport
and
saratoga
that
all
the
wealthy
southern
people
invariably
take
every
summer
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
lovely
and
dancing
talking
and
laughing
as
if
they
were
in
their
own
they
had
passed
the
time
away
till
they
all
separated
for
the
night
at
the
first
sound
of
the
exploding
boiler
c
jumped
up
and
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
ran
on
deck
the
scene
was
one
of
horrible
confusion
women
screaming
men
swearing
the
deck
strewn
with
broken
fragments
of
all
descriptions
the
vessel
leaning
frightfully
to
one
side
and
everybody
running
hither
and
thither
in
the
darkness
in
horror
and
dismay
he
had
left
georgia
with
f
and
n
the
two
children
and
one
of
the
female
servants
of
these
ladies
under
his
charge
he
went
immediately
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
and
called
f
they
were
all
there
he
bade
them
dress
as
quickly
as
possible
and
be
ready
to
follow
and
obey
him
he
returned
almost
instantly
and
led
them
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
where
into
the
boats
that
had
already
been
lowered
desperate
men
and
women
were
beginning
to
swarm
throwing
themselves
out
of
the
sinking
ship
he
bade
f
jump
down
into
one
of
these
boats
which
was
only
in
the
possession
of
two
sailors
she
instantly
obeyed
him
and
he
threw
her
little
boy
to
the
men
after
her
he
then
ordered
n
with
the
negro
woman
to
throw
themselves
off
the
vessel
into
the
boat
and
with
n
baby
in
his
arms
sprang
after
them
his
foot
touched
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
and
he
fell
into
the
water
but
recovering
himself
instantly
he
clambered
into
the
boat
which
he
then
peremptorily
ordered
the
men
to
set
adrift
in
spite
of
the
shrieks
and
cries
and
commands
and
entreaties
of
the
frantic
crowds
who
were
endeavouring
to
get
into
it
the
men
obeyed
him
and
rowing
while
he
steered
they
presently
fell
astern
of
the
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
and
tumult
and
terror
another
boat
laden
with
people
was
near
them
for
some
time
they
saw
the
heartrending
spectacle
of
the
sinking
vessel
and
the
sea
strewn
with
mattresses
seats
planks
c
to
which
people
were
clinging
floating
and
shrieking
for
succour
in
the
dark
water
all
round
them
but
they
gradually
pulled
further
and
further
out
of
the
horrible
chaos
of
despair
and
with
the
other
boat
still
consorting
with
them
rowed
on
they
watched
from
a
distance
the
piteous
sight
of
the
steamer
settling
down
the
gay
girdle
of
light
that
marked
the
line
of
her
beautiful
saloons
and
cabins
gradually
sinking
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
blackness
in
which
they
were
presently
extinguished
and
the
ship
with
all
its
precious
human
freight
engulfed
all
but
the
handful
left
in
those
two
open
boats
to
brave
the
dangers
of
that
terrible
coast
they
were
somewhere
off
the
north
carolina
shore
which
when
the
daylight
dawned
they
could
distinctly
see
with
its
ominous
line
of
breakers
and
inhospitable
perilous
coast
the
men
had
continued
rowing
all
night
and
as
the
summer
sun
rose
flaming
over
their
heads
the
task
of
pulling
the
boat
became
dreadfully
severe
still
they
followed
the
coast
c
looking
out
for
any
opening
creek
or
small
inlet
that
might
give
them
a
chance
of
landing
in
safety
the
other
boat
rowed
on
at
some
little
distance
from
them
all
the
morning
and
through
the
tremendous
heat
of
the
middle
day
they
toiled
on
without
a
mouthful
of
food
without
a
drop
of
water
at
length
towards
the
afternoon
the
men
at
the
oars
said
they
were
utterly
exhausted
and
could
row
no
longer
and
that
c
must
steer
the
boat
ashore
with
wonderful
power
of
command
he
prevailed
on
them
to
continue
their
afflicting
labour
the
terrible
blazing
sun
pouring
on
all
their
unsheltered
heads
had
almost
annihilated
them
but
still
there
lay
between
them
and
the
land
those
fearful
foaming
ridges
and
the
women
and
children
if
not
the
men
themselves
seemed
doomed
to
inevitable
death
in
the
attempt
to
surmount
them
suddenly
they
perceived
that
the
boat
that
had
kept
them
company
was
about
to
adventure
itself
in
the
perilous
experiment
of
landing
c
kept
his
boat
head
steady
the
men
rested
on
their
oars
and
watched
the
result
of
the
fearful
risk
they
were
themselves
about
to
run
they
saw
the
boat
enter
the
breakers
they
saw
her
whirled
round
and
capsized
and
then
they
watched
slowly
emerging
and
dragging
themselves
out
of
the
foaming
sea
and
only
some
of
the
people
that
they
knew
the
boat
contained
c
fortified
with
this
terrible
illustration
of
the
peril
that
awaited
them
again
besought
them
to
row
yet
for
a
little
while
further
along
the
coast
in
search
of
some
possible
place
to
take
the
boat
safely
to
the
beach
promising
at
sunset
to
give
up
the
search
and
again
the
poor
men
resumed
their
toil
but
the
line
of
leaping
breakers
stretched
along
the
coast
as
far
as
eye
could
see
and
at
length
the
men
declared
they
could
labour
no
longer
and
insisted
that
c
should
steer
them
to
shore
he
then
said
that
he
would
do
so
but
they
must
take
some
rest
before
encountering
the
peril
which
awaited
them
and
for
which
they
might
require
whatever
remaining
strength
they
could
command
he
made
the
men
leave
the
oars
and
lie
down
to
sleep
for
a
short
time
and
then
giving
the
helm
to
one
of
them
did
the
same
himself
when
they
were
thus
a
little
refreshed
with
this
short
rest
he
prepared
to
take
the
boat
into
the
breakers
he
laid
n
baby
on
her
breast
and
wrapped
a
shawl
round
and
round
her
body
so
as
to
secure
the
child
to
it
and
said
in
the
event
of
the
boat
capsizing
he
would
endeavour
to
save
her
and
her
child
f
and
her
boy
he
gave
in
charge
to
one
of
the
sailors
and
the
coloured
woman
who
was
with
her
to
the
other
and
they
promised
solemnly
in
case
of
misadventure
to
the
boat
to
do
their
best
to
save
these
helpless
creatures
and
so
they
turned
as
the
sun
was
going
down
the
bows
of
the
boat
to
the
terrible
shore
they
rose
two
of
the
breakers
safely
but
then
the
oar
of
one
of
the
men
was
struck
from
his
hand
and
in
an
instant
the
boat
whirled
round
and
turned
over
c
instantly
struck
out
to
seize
n
but
she
had
sunk
and
though
he
dived
twice
he
could
not
see
her
at
last
he
felt
her
hair
floating
loose
with
his
foot
and
seizing
hold
of
it
grasped
her
securely
and
swam
with
her
to
shore
while
in
the
act
of
doing
so
he
saw
the
man
who
had
promised
to
save
the
coloured
woman
making
alone
for
the
beach
and
even
then
in
that
extremity
he
had
power
of
command
enough
left
to
drive
the
fellow
back
to
seek
her
which
he
did
and
brought
her
safe
to
land
the
other
man
kept
his
word
of
taking
care
of
f
and
the
latter
never
released
her
grasp
of
her
child
wrist
which
bore
the
mark
of
her
agony
for
weeks
after
their
escape
they
reached
the
sands
and
n
shawl
having
been
unwound
her
child
was
found
laughing
on
her
bosom
but
hardly
had
they
had
time
to
thank
god
for
their
deliverance
when
c
fell
fainting
on
the
beach
and
f
who
told
me
this
said
that
for
one
dreadful
moment
they
thought
that
the
preserver
of
all
their
lives
had
lost
his
own
in
the
terrible
exertion
and
anxiety
that
he
had
undergone
he
revived
however
and
crawling
a
little
further
up
the
beach
they
burrowed
for
warmth
and
shelter
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
sand
and
lay
there
till
the
next
morning
when
they
sought
and
found
succour
you
can
not
imagine
my
dear
e
how
strikingly
throughout
this
whole
narrative
the
extraordinary
power
of
c
character
makes
itself
felt
the
immediate
obedience
that
he
obtained
from
women
whose
terror
might
have
made
them
unmanageable
and
men
whose
selfishness
might
have
defied
his
control
the
wise
though
painful
firmness
which
enabled
him
to
order
the
boat
away
from
the
side
of
the
perishing
vessel
in
spite
of
the
pity
that
he
felt
for
the
many
in
attempting
to
succour
whom
he
could
only
have
jeopardized
the
few
whom
he
was
bound
to
save
the
wonderful
influence
he
exercised
over
the
poor
oarsmen
whose
long
protracted
labour
postponed
to
the
last
possible
moment
the
terrible
risk
of
their
landing
the
firmness
courage
humanity
wisdom
and
presence
of
mind
of
all
his
preparations
for
their
final
tremendous
risk
and
the
authority
which
he
was
able
to
exercise
while
struggling
in
the
foaming
water
for
his
own
life
and
that
of
the
woman
and
child
he
was
saving
over
the
man
who
was
proving
false
to
a
similar
sacred
charge
all
these
admirable
traits
are
most
miserably
transmitted
to
you
by
my
imperfect
account
and
when
i
assure
you
that
his
own
narrative
full
as
it
necessarily
was
of
the
details
of
his
own
heroism
was
as
simple
modest
and
unpretending
as
it
was
interesting
and
touching
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
he
must
be
a
very
rare
man
when
i
spoke
with
enthusiasm
to
his
old
father
of
his
son
noble
conduct
and
asked
him
if
he
was
not
proud
of
it
his
sole
reply
was
am
glad
madam
my
son
was
not
selfish
now
e
i
have
often
spoken
with
you
and
written
to
you
of
the
disastrous
effect
of
slavery
upon
the
character
of
the
white
men
implicated
in
it
many
among
themselves
feel
and
acknowledge
it
to
the
fullest
extent
and
no
one
more
than
myself
can
deplore
that
any
human
being
i
love
should
be
subjected
to
such
baneful
influences
but
the
devil
must
have
his
due
and
men
brought
up
in
habits
of
peremptory
command
over
their
fellow
men
and
under
the
constant
apprehension
of
danger
and
awful
necessity
of
immediate
readiness
to
meet
it
acquire
qualities
precious
to
themselves
and
others
in
hours
of
supreme
peril
such
as
this
man
passed
through
saving
by
their
exercise
himself
and
all
committed
to
his
charge
i
know
that
the
southern
men
are
apt
to
deny
the
fact
that
they
do
live
under
an
habitual
sense
of
danger
but
a
slave
population
coerced
into
obedience
though
unarmed
and
half
fed
a
threatening
source
of
constant
insecurity
and
every
southern
to
whom
i
have
spoken
on
the
subject
has
admitted
to
me
that
they
live
in
terror
of
their
slaves
happy
are
such
of
them
as
have
protectors
like
j
c
such
men
will
best
avoid
and
best
encounter
the
perils
that
may
assail
them
from
the
abject
subject
human
element
in
the
control
of
which
their
noble
faculties
are
sadly
and
unworthily
employed
i
rode
after
breakfast
to
d
another
of
my
neighbours
who
lives
full
twelve
miles
off
during
the
last
two
miles
of
my
expedition
i
had
the
white
sand
hillocks
and
blue
line
of
the
atlantic
in
view
the
house
at
which
i
called
was
a
barrack
of
a
dwelling
in
the
woods
with
a
sort
of
pretentious
air
about
it
like
sundry
planters
dwellings
that
i
have
seen
i
was
received
by
the
sons
as
well
as
the
lady
of
the
house
and
could
not
but
admire
the
lordly
rather
than
manly
indifference
with
which
these
young
gentlemen
in
gay
guard
chains
and
fine
attire
played
the
gallants
to
me
while
filthy
half
naked
negro
women
brought
in
refreshments
and
stood
all
the
while
fanning
the
cake
and
sweetmeats
and
their
young
masters
as
if
they
had
been
all
the
same
sort
of
stuff
i
felt
ashamed
for
the
lads
the
conversation
turned
upon
h
trial
for
there
has
been
a
trial
as
a
matter
of
form
and
an
acquittal
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
gentlemen
said
upon
my
expressing
some
surprise
at
the
latter
event
that
there
could
not
be
found
in
all
georgia
a
jury
who
would
convict
him
which
says
but
little
for
the
moral
sense
of
georgia
from
this
most
painful
subject
we
fell
into
the
brunswick
canal
and
thereafter
i
took
my
leave
and
rode
home
i
met
my
babies
in
the
and
took
s
up
before
me
and
gave
her
a
good
gallop
home
having
reached
the
house
with
the
appetite
of
a
miles
ride
i
found
no
preparation
for
dinner
and
not
so
much
as
a
boiled
potato
to
eat
and
the
sole
reply
to
my
famished
and
disconsolate
exclamations
was
that
you
order
none
missis
i
not
know
i
had
forgotten
to
order
my
dinner
and
my
unauthorised
had
not
ventured
to
prepare
any
would
a
yankee
have
said
now
you
went
off
so
uncommon
quick
i
kinder
guessed
you
forgot
all
about
dinner
and
have
had
it
all
ready
for
me
but
my
slaves
durst
not
and
so
i
fasted
till
some
tea
could
be
got
for
me
this
was
the
last
letter
i
wrote
from
the
plantation
and
i
never
returned
there
nor
ever
saw
again
any
of
the
poor
people
among
whom
i
lived
during
this
winter
but
jack
once
under
sad
circumstances
the
poor
health
failed
so
completely
that
his
owners
humanely
brought
him
to
the
north
to
try
what
benefit
he
might
derive
from
the
change
but
this
was
before
the
passing
of
the
fugitive
slave
bill
when
touching
the
soil
of
the
northern
states
a
slave
became
free
and
such
was
the
apprehension
felt
lest
jack
should
be
enlightened
as
to
this
fact
by
some
philanthropic
abolitionist
that
he
was
kept
shut
up
in
a
high
upper
room
of
a
large
empty
house
where
even
i
was
not
allowed
to
visit
him
i
heard
at
length
of
his
being
in
philadelphia
and
upon
my
distinct
statement
that
i
considered
freeing
their
slaves
the
business
of
the
themselves
and
not
mine
i
was
at
length
permitted
to
see
him
poor
fellow
coming
to
the
north
did
not
prove
to
him
the
delight
his
eager
desire
had
so
often
anticipated
from
it
nor
under
such
circumstances
is
it
perhaps
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
benefited
but
little
by
the
change
he
died
not
long
after
i
once
heard
a
conversation
between
o
and
k
the
two
overseers
of
the
plantation
on
which
i
was
living
upon
the
question
of
taking
slaves
servants
necessary
attendants
into
the
northern
states
o
urged
the
danger
of
their
being
hold
of
set
free
by
the
abolitionists
to
which
k
very
pertinently
replied
stuff
and
nonsense
i
take
care
when
my
wife
goes
north
with
the
children
to
send
lucy
with
her
children
are
down
here
and
i
defy
all
the
abolitionists
in
creation
to
get
her
to
stay
k
was
an
extremely
wise
man
appendix
i
wrote
the
following
letter
after
reading
several
leading
articles
in
the
newspaper
at
the
time
of
the
great
sensation
occasioned
by
beecher
stowe
novel
of
tom
cabin
and
after
the
protest
which
that
book
induced
the
women
of
england
to
address
to
those
of
america
on
the
subject
of
the
condition
of
the
slaves
in
the
southern
states
my
dear
e
i
have
read
the
articles
in
the
to
which
you
refer
on
the
subject
of
the
inaccuracy
of
beecher
stowe
book
as
a
picture
of
slavery
in
america
and
have
ascertained
who
they
were
written
by
having
done
so
i
do
not
think
it
worth
while
to
send
my
letter
for
insertion
because
as
that
is
the
tone
deliberately
taken
upon
the
subject
by
that
paper
my
counter
statement
would
not
i
imagine
be
admitted
into
its
columns
i
enclose
it
to
you
as
i
should
like
you
to
see
how
far
from
true
according
to
my
experience
the
statements
of
the
correspondent
are
it
is
impossible
of
course
to
know
why
it
erects
itself
into
an
advocate
for
slavery
and
the
most
charitable
conjecture
i
can
form
upon
the
subject
is
that
the
stafford
house
demonstration
may
have
been
thought
likely
to
wound
the
sensitive
national
views
of
america
upon
this
subject
and
the
statement
put
forward
by
the
contradicting
stowe
picture
may
be
intended
to
soothe
their
irritation
at
the
philanthropic
zeal
of
our
lady
abolitionists
believe
me
dear
e
yours
always
truly
to
the
editor
of
sir
as
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
you
consciously
afford
the
support
of
your
great
influence
to
misstatements
i
request
your
attention
to
some
remarks
i
wish
to
make
on
an
article
on
a
book
called
tom
cabin
as
it
is
contained
in
your
paper
of
the
in
treating
harriet
beecher
stowe
work
as
an
exaggerated
picture
of
the
evils
of
slavery
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
you
do
her
serious
injustice
of
the
merits
of
her
book
as
a
work
of
art
i
have
no
desire
to
speak
to
its
power
as
a
most
interesting
and
pathetic
story
all
england
and
america
can
bear
witness
but
of
its
truth
and
moderation
as
a
representation
of
the
slave
system
in
the
united
states
i
can
testify
with
the
experience
of
an
eye
witness
having
been
a
resident
in
the
southern
states
and
had
opportunities
of
observation
such
as
no
one
who
has
not
lived
on
a
slave
estate
can
have
it
is
very
true
that
in
reviving
the
altogether
exploded
fashion
of
making
the
hero
of
her
novel
perfect
monster
that
the
world
saw
stowe
has
laid
herself
open
to
fair
criticism
and
must
expect
to
meet
with
it
from
the
very
opposite
taste
of
the
present
day
but
the
ideal
excellence
of
her
principal
character
is
no
argument
at
all
against
the
general
accuracy
of
her
statements
with
regard
to
the
evils
of
slavery
everything
else
in
her
book
is
not
only
possible
but
probable
and
not
only
probable
but
a
very
faithful
representation
of
the
existing
facts
faithful
and
not
as
you
accuse
it
of
being
exaggerated
for
with
the
exception
of
the
horrible
catastrophe
the
flogging
to
death
of
poor
tom
she
has
pourtrayed
none
of
the
most
revolting
instances
of
crime
produced
by
the
slave
system
with
which
she
might
have
darkened
her
picture
without
detracting
from
its
perfect
truth
even
with
respect
to
the
incident
of
tom
death
it
must
not
be
said
that
if
such
an
event
is
possible
it
is
hardly
probable
for
this
is
unfortunately
not
true
it
is
not
true
that
the
value
of
the
slave
as
property
infallibly
protects
his
life
from
the
passions
of
his
master
it
is
no
new
thing
for
a
man
passions
to
blind
him
to
his
most
obvious
and
immediate
temporal
interests
as
well
as
to
his
higher
and
everlasting
ones
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
stages
of
civilisation
various
human
passions
assume
successive
prominence
and
become
developed
to
the
partial
exclusion
or
deadening
of
others
in
savage
existence
and
those
states
of
civilisation
least
removed
from
it
the
animal
passions
predominate
in
highly
cultivated
modern
society
where
the
complicated
machinery
of
human
existence
is
at
once
a
perpetually
renewed
cause
and
effect
of
certain
legal
and
moral
restraints
which
in
the
shape
of
government
and
public
opinion
protect
the
congregated
lives
and
interests
of
men
from
the
worst
outrages
of
open
violence
the
natural
selfishness
of
mankind
assumes
a
different
development
and
the
love
of
power
of
pleasure
or
of
pelf
exhibits
different
phenomena
from
those
elicited
from
a
savage
under
the
influence
of
the
same
passions
the
channel
in
which
the
energy
and
activity
of
modern
society
inclines
more
and
more
to
pour
itself
is
the
peaceful
one
of
the
pursuit
of
gain
this
is
preeminently
the
case
with
the
two
great
commercial
nations
of
the
earth
england
and
america
and
in
either
england
or
the
northern
states
of
america
the
prudential
and
practical
views
of
life
prevail
so
far
that
instances
of
men
sacrificing
their
money
interests
at
the
instigation
of
rage
revenge
and
hatred
will
certainly
not
abound
but
the
southern
slaveholders
are
a
very
different
race
of
men
from
either
manchester
manufacturers
or
massachusetts
merchants
they
are
a
remnant
of
barbarism
and
feudalism
maintaining
itself
with
infinite
difficulty
and
danger
by
the
side
of
the
latest
and
most
powerful
developement
of
commercial
civilisation
the
inhabitants
of
baltimore
richmond
charleston
savannah
and
new
orleans
whose
estates
lie
like
the
suburban
retreats
of
our
city
magnates
in
the
near
neighbourhood
of
their
respective
cities
are
not
now
the
people
i
refer
to
they
are
softened
and
enlightened
by
many
influences
the
action
of
city
life
itself
where
human
sympathy
and
human
respect
stimulated
by
neighbourhood
produce
salutary
social
restraint
as
well
as
less
salutary
social
cowardice
they
travel
to
the
northern
states
and
to
europe
and
europe
and
the
northern
states
travel
to
them
and
in
spite
of
themselves
their
peculiar
conditions
receive
modifications
from
foreign
intercourse
the
influence
too
of
commercial
enterprise
which
in
these
latter
days
is
becoming
the
agent
of
civilisation
all
over
the
earth
affects
even
the
uncommercial
residents
of
the
southern
cities
and
however
cordially
they
may
dislike
or
despise
the
mercantile
tendencies
of
atlantic
americans
or
transatlantic
englishmen
their
frequent
contact
with
them
breaks
down
some
of
the
barriers
of
difference
between
them
and
humanises
the
slaveholder
of
the
great
cities
into
some
relation
with
the
spirit
of
his
own
times
and
country
but
these
men
are
but
a
most
inconsiderable
portion
of
the
slaveholding
population
of
the
south
a
nation
for
as
such
they
should
be
spoken
of
of
men
whose
organisation
and
temperament
is
that
of
the
southern
european
living
under
the
influence
of
a
climate
at
once
enervating
and
exciting
scattered
over
trackless
wildernesses
of
arid
sand
and
pestilential
swamp
entrenched
within
their
own
boundaries
surrounded
by
creatures
absolutely
subject
to
their
despotic
will
delivered
over
by
hard
necessity
to
the
lowest
excitements
of
drinking
gambling
and
debauchery
for
sole
recreation
independent
of
all
opinion
ignorant
of
all
progress
isolated
from
all
society
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
savage
existence
within
the
pale
of
any
modern
civilisation
the
south
carolinan
gentry
have
been
fond
of
styling
themselves
the
chivalry
of
the
south
and
perhaps
might
not
badly
represent
in
their
relations
with
their
dependents
the
nobility
of
france
before
the
purifying
hurricane
of
the
revolution
swept
the
rights
of
the
suzerain
and
the
wrongs
of
the
serf
together
into
one
bloody
abyss
the
planters
of
the
interior
of
the
southern
and
states
with
their
furious
feuds
and
slaughterous
combats
their
stabbings
and
pistolings
their
gross
sensuality
brutal
ignorance
and
despotic
cruelty
resemble
the
chivalry
of
france
before
the
horrors
of
the
jacquerie
admonished
them
that
there
was
a
limit
even
to
the
endurance
of
slaves
with
such
men
as
these
human
life
even
when
it
can
be
bought
or
sold
in
the
market
for
so
many
dollars
is
but
little
protected
by
considerations
of
interest
from
the
effects
of
any
violent
passion
there
is
yet
however
another
aspect
of
the
question
which
is
that
it
is
sometimes
clearly
the
interest
of
the
owner
to
prolong
the
life
of
his
slaves
as
in
the
case
of
inferior
or
superannuated
labourers
or
the
very
notorious
instance
in
which
some
of
the
owners
of
sugar
plantations
stated
that
they
found
it
better
worth
their
while
to
kill
with
labour
a
certain
proportion
of
their
force
and
replace
them
by
new
hands
every
seven
years
than
work
them
less
severely
and
maintain
them
in
diminished
efficiency
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
here
you
will
observe
a
precise
estimate
of
the
planter
material
interest
led
to
a
result
which
you
argue
passion
itself
can
never
be
so
blind
as
to
adopt
this
was
a
deliberate
economical
calculation
openly
avowed
some
years
ago
by
a
number
of
sugar
planters
in
louisiana
if
instead
of
accusing
stowe
of
exaggeration
you
had
brought
the
same
charge
against
the
author
of
the
slave
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
for
his
book
presents
some
of
the
most
revolting
instances
of
atrocity
and
crime
that
the
miserable
abuse
of
irresponsible
power
is
capable
of
producing
and
it
is
by
no
means
written
in
the
spirit
of
universal
humanity
which
pervades
stowe
volumes
but
it
is
not
liable
to
the
charge
of
exaggeration
any
more
than
her
less
disgusting
delineation
the
scenes
described
in
the
slave
occur
in
the
slave
states
of
north
america
and
in
two
of
the
most
appalling
incidents
of
the
book
the
burning
alive
of
the
captured
runaway
and
the
hanging
without
trial
of
the
vicksburg
gamblers
the
author
of
the
has
very
simply
related
positive
facts
of
notorious
occurrence
to
which
he
might
have
added
had
he
seen
fit
to
do
so
the
instance
of
a
slave
who
perished
in
the
sea
swamps
where
he
was
left
bound
and
naked
a
prey
to
the
torture
inflicted
upon
him
by
the
venomous
mosquito
swarms
my
purpose
however
in
addressing
you
was
not
to
enter
into
a
disquisition
on
either
of
these
publications
but
i
am
not
sorry
to
take
this
opportunity
of
bearing
witness
to
the
truth
of
stowe
admirable
book
and
i
have
seen
what
few
englishmen
can
see
the
working
of
the
system
in
the
midst
of
it
in
reply
to
your
observer
who
went
to
the
south
professedly
with
the
purpose
of
seeing
and
judging
of
the
state
of
things
for
himself
let
me
tell
you
that
little
as
he
may
be
disposed
to
believe
it
his
testimony
is
worth
less
than
nothing
for
it
is
morally
impossible
for
any
englishman
going
into
the
southern
states
except
as
a
to
know
anything
whatever
of
the
real
condition
of
the
slave
population
this
was
the
case
some
years
ago
as
i
experienced
and
it
is
now
likely
to
be
more
the
case
than
ever
for
the
institution
is
not
approved
divine
to
the
perceptions
of
englishmen
and
the
southerners
are
as
anxious
to
hide
its
uglier
features
from
any
observer
from
this
side
the
water
as
to
present
to
his
admiration
and
approval
such
as
can
by
any
possibility
be
made
to
wear
the
most
distant
approach
to
comeliness
the
gentry
of
the
southern
states
are
preeminent
in
their
own
country
for
that
species
of
manner
which
contrasted
with
the
breeding
of
the
northerners
would
be
emphatically
pronounced
by
englishmen
born
to
inhabit
landed
property
they
are
not
inevitably
made
clerks
and
men
of
but
inherit
with
their
estates
some
of
the
invariable
characteristics
of
an
aristocracy
the
shop
is
not
their
element
and
the
eager
spirit
of
speculation
and
the
sordid
spirit
of
gain
do
not
infect
their
whole
existence
even
to
their
very
demeanour
and
appearance
as
they
too
manifestly
do
those
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
states
good
manners
have
an
undue
value
for
englishmen
generally
speaking
and
whatever
departs
from
their
peculiar
standard
of
breeding
is
apt
to
prejudice
them
as
whatever
approaches
it
prepossesses
them
far
more
than
is
reasonable
the
southerners
are
infinitely
better
bred
men
according
to
english
notions
than
the
men
of
the
northern
states
the
habit
of
command
gives
them
a
certain
the
enjoyment
of
leisure
a
certain
ease
their
temperament
is
impulsive
and
enthusiastic
and
their
manners
have
the
grace
and
spirit
which
seldom
belong
to
the
deportment
of
a
northern
people
but
upon
more
familiar
acquaintance
the
vices
of
the
social
system
to
which
they
belong
will
be
found
to
have
infected
them
with
their
own
peculiar
taint
and
haughty
overbearing
irritability
effeminate
indolence
reckless
extravagance
and
a
union
of
profligacy
and
cruelty
which
is
the
immediate
result
of
their
irresponsible
power
over
their
dependents
are
some
of
the
less
pleasing
traits
which
acquaintance
developes
in
a
southern
character
in
spite
of
all
this
there
is
no
manner
of
doubt
that
the
english
observer
will
for
the
season
of
his
sojourning
among
them
greatly
prefer
their
intercourse
to
that
of
their
northern
brethren
moreover
without
in
the
least
suspecting
it
he
will
be
bribed
insidiously
and
incessantly
by
the
extreme
desire
and
endeavour
to
please
and
prepossess
him
which
the
whole
white
population
of
the
slave
states
will
exhibit
as
long
as
he
goes
only
as
a
observer
with
a
mind
not
made
up
upon
the
subject
of
slavery
and
open
to
conviction
as
to
its
virtues
every
conciliating
demonstration
of
courtesy
and
hospitable
kindness
will
be
extended
to
him
and
as
i
said
before
if
his
observation
is
permitted
and
it
may
even
appear
to
be
courted
it
will
be
to
a
fairly
bound
purified
edition
of
the
black
book
of
slavery
in
which
though
the
inherent
viciousness
of
the
whole
story
can
not
be
suppressed
the
coarser
and
more
offensive
passages
will
be
carefully
expunged
and
now
permit
me
to
observe
that
the
remarks
of
your
traveller
must
derive
much
of
their
value
from
the
scene
of
his
enquiry
in
maryland
kentucky
and
virginia
the
outward
aspect
of
slavery
has
ceased
to
wear
its
most
deplorable
features
the
remaining
vitality
of
the
system
no
longer
resides
in
the
interests
but
in
the
pride
and
prejudices
of
the
planters
their
soil
and
climate
are
alike
favourable
to
the
labours
of
a
white
peasantry
the
slave
cultivation
has
had
time
to
prove
itself
there
the
destructive
pest
which
in
time
it
will
prove
itself
wherever
it
prevails
the
vast
estates
and
large
fortunes
that
once
maintained
and
were
maintained
by
the
serfdom
of
hundreds
of
negroes
have
dwindled
in
size
and
sunk
in
value
till
the
slaves
have
become
so
heavy
a
burthen
on
the
resources
of
the
exhausted
soil
and
impoverished
owners
of
it
that
they
are
made
themselves
objects
of
traffic
in
order
to
ward
off
the
ruin
that
their
increase
would
otherwise
entail
thus
the
plantations
of
the
northern
slave
states
now
present
to
the
traveller
very
few
of
the
darker
and
more
oppressive
peculiarities
of
the
system
and
provided
he
does
not
stray
too
near
the
precincts
where
the
negroes
are
sold
or
come
across
gangs
of
them
on
their
way
to
georgia
louisiana
or
alabama
he
may
if
he
is
a
very
superficial
observer
conclude
that
the
most
prosperous
slavery
is
not
much
worse
than
the
most
miserable
freedom
but
of
what
value
will
be
such
conclusions
applied
to
those
numerous
plantations
where
no
white
man
ever
sets
foot
without
the
express
permission
of
the
owner
not
estates
lying
close
to
baltimore
and
charleston
or
even
lesington
or
savannah
but
remote
and
savage
wildernesses
like
legree
estate
in
tom
like
all
the
plantations
in
the
interior
of
tennessee
and
alabama
like
the
and
of
the
great
muddy
rivers
of
lousiana
and
georgia
like
the
dreary
pine
barrens
and
endless
woody
wastes
of
north
carolina
these
especially
the
islands
are
like
so
many
fortresses
approachable
for
only
at
the
owners
will
on
most
of
the
rice
plantations
in
these
pestilential
regions
no
white
man
can
pass
the
night
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
without
running
the
risk
of
his
life
and
during
the
day
the
master
and
overseer
are
as
much
alone
and
irresponsible
in
their
dominion
over
their
black
cattle
as
robinson
crusoe
was
over
his
small
family
of
animals
on
his
desert
habitation
who
on
such
estates
as
these
shall
witness
to
any
act
of
tyranny
or
barbarity
however
atrocious
no
black
man
testimony
is
allowed
against
a
white
and
who
on
the
dismal
swampy
of
the
savannah
or
the
of
the
mississippi
and
its
tributaries
or
the
up
country
cotton
lands
of
the
ocamulgee
shall
go
to
perform
the
task
of
candid
observation
and
benevolent
enquiry
i
passed
some
time
on
two
such
estates
plantations
where
the
negroes
esteemed
themselves
well
off
and
compared
with
the
slaves
on
several
of
the
neighbouring
properties
might
very
well
consider
themselves
so
and
i
will
with
your
permission
contrast
some
of
the
items
of
my
observation
with
those
of
the
traveller
whose
report
you
find
so
satisfactory
on
the
subject
of
the
of
slavery
and
first
for
the
attachment
which
he
affirms
to
subsist
between
the
slave
and
master
i
do
not
deny
that
certain
manifestations
on
the
part
of
the
slave
may
suggest
the
idea
of
such
a
feeling
but
whether
upon
better
examination
it
will
be
found
to
deserve
the
name
i
very
much
doubt
in
the
first
place
on
some
of
the
great
southern
estates
the
owners
are
habitual
absentees
utterly
unknown
to
their
serfs
and
enjoying
the
proceeds
of
their
labour
in
residences
as
remote
as
possible
from
the
sands
and
swamps
where
their
rice
and
cotton
grow
and
their
slaves
bow
themselves
under
the
eye
of
the
white
overseer
and
the
lash
of
the
black
driver
some
of
these
sybarites
prefer
living
in
paris
that
paradise
of
american
republicans
some
in
the
capitals
of
the
middle
states
of
the
union
philadelphia
or
new
york
the
air
of
new
england
has
a
keen
edge
of
liberty
which
suits
few
southern
constitutions
and
unkindly
as
abolition
has
found
its
native
soil
and
native
skies
that
is
its
birthplace
and
there
it
flourishes
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
root
it
out
and
trample
it
down
and
within
any
atmosphere
poisoned
by
its
influence
no
slaveholder
can
willingly
draw
breath
some
travel
in
europe
and
few
whose
means
permit
the
contrary
ever
pass
the
entire
year
on
their
plantations
great
intervals
of
many
years
pass
and
no
master
ever
visits
some
of
these
properties
what
species
of
attachment
do
you
think
the
slave
entertains
for
him
in
other
cases
the
visits
made
will
be
of
a
few
days
in
one
of
the
winter
months
the
estate
and
its
cultivators
remaining
for
the
rest
of
the
year
under
the
absolute
control
of
the
overseer
who
provided
he
contrives
to
get
a
good
crop
of
rice
or
cotton
into
the
market
for
his
employers
is
left
to
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
a
will
seldom
uninfluenced
for
evil
by
the
combined
effects
of
the
grossest
ignorance
and
habitual
intemperance
the
temptation
to
the
latter
vice
is
almost
irresistible
to
a
white
man
in
such
a
climate
and
leading
an
existence
of
brutal
isolation
among
a
parcel
of
human
beings
as
like
brutes
as
they
can
be
made
but
the
owner
who
at
these
distant
intervals
of
months
or
years
revisits
his
estates
is
looked
upon
as
a
returning
providence
by
the
poor
negroes
they
have
no
experience
of
his
character
to
destroy
their
hopes
in
his
goodness
and
all
possible
and
impossible
ameliorations
of
their
condition
are
anticipated
from
his
advent
less
work
more
food
fewer
stripes
and
some
of
that
consideration
which
the
slave
hopes
may
spring
from
his
positive
money
value
to
his
owner
a
fallacious
dependence
as
i
have
already
attempted
to
show
but
one
which
if
it
has
not
always
predominating
weight
with
the
master
never
can
have
any
with
the
overseer
who
has
not
even
the
feeling
of
regard
for
his
own
property
to
mitigate
his
absolutism
over
the
slaves
of
another
man
there
is
a
very
powerful
cause
which
makes
the
prosperity
and
as
far
as
life
is
concerned
of
most
masters
a
subject
of
solicitude
with
their
slaves
the
only
stability
of
their
condition
such
as
it
is
hangs
upon
it
if
the
owner
of
a
plantation
dies
his
estates
may
fall
into
the
market
and
his
slaves
be
sold
at
public
auction
the
next
day
and
whether
this
promises
a
better
or
threatens
a
worse
condition
the
slaves
can
not
know
and
no
human
being
cares
one
thing
it
inevitably
brings
the
uprooting
of
all
old
associations
the
disruption
of
all
the
ties
of
fellowship
in
misery
the
tearing
asunder
of
all
relations
of
blood
and
affection
the
sale
into
separate
and
far
distant
districts
of
fathers
mothers
husbands
wives
and
children
if
the
estate
does
not
lie
in
the
extreme
south
there
is
the
vague
dread
of
being
driven
thither
from
virginia
to
georgia
from
carolina
to
alabama
or
louisiana
a
change
which
for
reasons
i
have
shown
above
implies
the
passing
from
a
higher
into
a
lower
circle
of
the
infernal
pit
of
slavery
i
once
heard
a
slave
on
the
plantation
of
an
absentee
express
the
most
lively
distress
at
hearing
that
his
master
was
before
however
i
had
recovered
from
my
surprise
at
this
warm
to
a
distant
and
all
but
unknown
proprietor
the
man
added
die
what
become
of
all
him
people
on
my
arrival
on
the
plantation
where
i
resided
i
was
hailed
with
the
most
extravagant
demonstrations
of
delight
and
all
but
lifted
off
my
feet
in
the
arms
of
people
who
had
never
seen
me
before
but
who
knowing
me
to
be
connected
with
their
owners
expected
from
me
some
of
the
multitudinous
benefits
which
they
always
hope
to
derive
from
masters
these
until
they
come
to
reside
among
them
are
always
believed
to
be
sources
of
beneficence
and
fountains
of
redress
by
the
poor
people
who
have
known
no
rule
but
the
delegated
tyranny
of
the
overseer
in
these
expectations
however
they
very
soon
find
themselves
cruelly
mistaken
of
course
if
the
absentee
planter
has
received
a
satisfactory
income
from
his
estate
he
is
inclined
to
be
satisfied
with
the
manager
of
it
and
as
subordination
to
the
only
white
man
among
hundreds
of
blacks
must
be
maintained
at
any
and
every
cost
the
overseer
is
justified
and
upheld
in
his
whole
administration
if
the
wretched
slave
ever
dared
to
prefer
a
complaint
of
the
most
atrocious
the
law
which
refuses
the
testimony
of
a
black
against
a
white
is
not
only
the
law
of
the
land
but
of
every
man
private
dealings
and
lying
being
one
of
the
natural
results
of
slavery
and
a
tendency
to
shirk
compelled
and
unrequited
labour
another
the
overseer
stands
on
excellent
when
he
refers
to
these
undoubted
characteristics
of
the
system
if
called
upon
to
rebut
any
charge
of
cruelty
or
injustice
but
pray
consider
for
a
moment
the
probability
of
any
such
charge
being
preferred
by
a
poor
creature
who
has
been
for
years
left
to
the
absolute
disposal
of
this
man
and
who
knows
very
well
that
in
a
few
days
or
months
at
furthest
the
master
will
again
depart
leaving
him
again
for
months
perhaps
for
years
utterly
at
the
mercy
of
the
man
against
whom
he
has
dared
to
prefer
a
complaint
on
the
estates
which
i
visited
the
owners
had
been
habitually
absent
and
the
of
slaves
to
such
masters
as
these
you
will
allow
can
hardly
come
under
the
denomination
of
a
strong
personal
feeling
your
authority
next
states
that
the
infirm
and
superannuated
slaves
no
longer
capable
of
ministering
to
their
masters
luxuries
on
the
estate
that
he
visited
were
ending
their
lives
among
all
the
comforts
of
home
with
kindred
and
friends
around
them
in
a
condition
which
he
contrasts
at
least
by
implication
very
favourably
with
the
workhouse
the
last
refuge
provided
by
the
social
humanity
of
england
for
the
pauper
labourer
when
he
has
reached
that
term
when
age
is
in
corners
thrown
on
the
plantation
where
i
lived
the
infirmary
was
a
large
room
the
walls
of
which
were
simply
mud
and
lathes
the
floor
the
soil
itself
damp
with
perpetual
drippings
from
the
holes
in
the
roof
and
the
open
space
which
served
for
a
window
was
protected
only
by
a
broken
shutter
which
in
order
to
exclude
the
cold
was
drawn
so
near
as
almost
to
exclude
the
light
at
the
same
time
upon
this
earthen
floor
with
nothing
but
its
hard
damp
surface
beneath
him
no
covering
but
a
tattered
shirt
and
trowsers
and
a
few
sticks
under
his
head
for
a
pillow
lay
an
old
man
of
upwards
of
seventy
dying
when
i
first
looked
at
him
i
thought
by
the
glazed
stare
of
his
eyes
and
the
flies
that
had
gathered
round
his
half
open
mouth
that
he
was
dead
but
on
stooping
nearer
i
perceived
that
the
last
faint
struggle
of
life
was
still
going
on
but
even
while
i
bent
over
him
it
ceased
and
so
like
a
hound
with
no
creature
to
comfort
or
relieve
his
last
agony
with
neither
christian
solace
or
human
succour
near
him
with
neither
wife
nor
child
nor
even
friendly
fellow
being
to
lift
his
head
from
the
knotty
sticks
on
which
he
had
rested
it
or
drive
away
the
insects
that
buzzed
round
his
lips
and
nostrils
like
those
of
a
fallen
beast
died
this
poor
old
slave
whose
life
had
been
exhausted
in
unrequited
labour
the
fruits
of
which
had
gone
to
pamper
the
pride
and
feed
the
luxury
of
those
who
knew
and
cared
neither
for
his
life
or
death
and
to
whom
if
they
had
heard
of
the
latter
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
absolute
though
small
gain
the
saving
of
a
daily
pittance
of
meal
which
served
to
prolong
a
life
no
longer
available
to
them
i
proceed
to
the
next
item
in
your
observer
record
all
children
below
the
age
of
twelve
were
unemployed
he
says
on
the
estate
he
visited
this
is
perhaps
a
questionable
benefit
when
no
process
of
mental
cultivation
being
permitted
the
only
employment
for
the
leisure
thus
allowed
is
that
of
rolling
like
dogs
or
cats
in
the
sand
and
the
sun
on
all
the
plantations
i
visited
and
on
those
where
i
resided
the
infants
in
arms
were
committed
to
the
care
of
these
juvenile
slaves
who
were
denominated
nurses
and
whose
sole
employment
was
what
they
call
to
baby
the
poor
little
negro
sucklings
were
cared
for
i
leave
to
your
own
judgement
how
efficiently
or
how
tenderly
by
these
slips
of
slavery
carried
by
them
to
the
fields
where
their
mothers
were
working
under
the
lash
to
receive
their
needful
nourishment
and
then
carried
back
again
to
the
or
collection
of
negro
huts
where
they
wallowed
unheeded
in
utter
filth
and
neglect
until
the
time
again
returned
for
their
being
carried
to
their
mother
breast
such
was
the
employment
of
the
children
of
eight
or
nine
years
old
and
the
only
supervision
exercised
over
either
babies
or
minders
was
that
of
the
old
woman
left
in
charge
of
the
infirmary
where
she
made
her
abode
all
day
long
and
bestowed
such
samples
of
her
care
and
skill
upon
its
inmates
as
i
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
presently
the
practice
of
thus
driving
the
mothers
even
while
their
infants
were
still
dependent
upon
them
for
their
daily
nourishment
is
one
of
which
the
evil
as
well
as
the
cruelty
is
abundantly
apparent
without
comment
the
next
note
of
admiration
elicited
from
your
observer
is
bestowed
upon
the
fact
that
the
domestic
servants
house
slaves
on
the
plantation
he
visited
were
to
live
away
from
the
owner
residence
and
to
marry
but
i
never
was
on
a
southern
plantation
and
i
never
heard
of
one
where
any
of
the
slaves
were
allowed
to
sleep
under
the
same
roof
with
their
owner
with
the
exception
of
the
women
to
whose
care
the
children
of
the
planter
if
he
had
any
might
be
confided
and
perhaps
a
little
boy
or
girl
slave
kept
as
a
sort
of
pet
animal
and
allowed
to
pass
the
night
on
the
floor
of
the
sleeping
apartment
of
some
member
of
the
family
the
residence
of
slaves
belonging
to
a
plantation
night
and
day
in
their
master
house
like
northern
or
european
servants
is
a
thing
i
believe
unknown
throughout
the
southern
states
of
course
i
except
the
cities
and
speak
only
of
the
estates
where
the
house
servants
are
neither
better
housed
or
accommodated
than
the
their
intolerably
dirty
habits
and
offensive
persons
would
indeed
render
it
a
severe
trial
to
any
family
accustomed
to
habits
of
decent
cleanliness
and
moreover
considerations
of
safety
and
that
cautious
vigilance
which
is
a
hard
necessity
of
the
planter
existence
in
spite
of
the
supposed
attachment
of
his
slaves
would
never
permit
the
near
proximity
during
the
unprotected
hours
of
the
night
of
those
whose
intimacy
with
the
daily
habits
and
knowledge
of
the
nightly
securities
resorted
to
might
prove
terrible
auxiliaries
to
any
attack
from
without
the
city
guards
patrols
and
together
with
their
stringent
rules
about
negroes
being
abroad
after
night
and
their
well
fortified
houses
for
all
detected
without
a
pass
afford
some
security
against
these
attached
dependents
but
on
remote
plantations
where
the
owner
and
his
family
and
perhaps
a
white
overseer
are
alone
surrounded
by
slaves
and
separated
from
all
succour
against
them
they
do
not
sleep
under
the
white
roof
and
for
politic
reasons
pass
the
night
away
from
their
abode
the
house
servants
have
no
other
or
better
allowance
of
food
than
the
field
labourers
but
have
the
advantage
of
eking
it
out
by
what
is
left
from
the
master
table
if
possible
with
even
less
comfort
in
one
respect
inasmuch
as
no
time
whatever
is
set
apart
for
their
meals
which
they
snatch
at
any
hour
and
in
any
way
that
they
can
generally
however
standing
or
squatting
on
their
hams
round
the
kitchen
fire
the
kitchen
being
a
mere
outhouse
or
barn
with
a
fire
in
it
on
the
estate
where
i
lived
as
i
have
mentioned
they
had
no
in
the
house
but
when
their
work
was
over
they
retired
like
the
rest
to
their
hovels
the
discomfort
of
which
had
to
them
all
the
additional
disadvantage
of
comparison
with
their
owner
mode
of
living
in
all
establishments
whatever
of
course
some
disparity
exists
between
the
accommodation
of
the
and
best
and
the
servants
kitchen
and
attics
but
on
a
plantation
it
is
no
longer
a
matter
of
degree
the
young
women
who
performed
the
offices
of
waiting
and
housemaids
and
the
lads
who
attended
upon
the
service
of
their
master
table
where
i
lived
had
neither
table
to
feed
at
nor
chair
to
sit
down
upon
themselves
the
lay
all
night
on
the
hearth
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
the
women
upon
the
usual
slave
bed
a
frame
of
rough
boards
strewed
with
a
little
moss
off
the
trees
with
the
addition
perhaps
of
a
tattered
and
filthy
blanket
as
for
the
privilege
of
marrying
surely
it
is
gross
mockery
to
apply
such
a
word
to
a
bond
which
may
be
holy
in
god
sight
but
which
did
not
prevent
the
owner
of
a
plantation
where
my
observations
were
made
from
selling
and
buying
men
and
their
wives
and
children
into
divided
bondage
nor
the
white
overseer
from
compelling
the
wife
of
one
of
the
most
excellent
and
exemplary
of
his
master
slaves
to
live
with
him
nor
the
white
wife
of
another
overseer
in
her
husband
temporary
absence
from
the
estate
from
barbarously
flogging
three
slaves
within
a
month
of
their
confinement
their
condition
being
the
result
of
the
profligacy
of
the
said
overseer
and
probably
compelled
by
the
very
same
lash
by
which
it
was
punished
this
is
a
very
disgusting
picture
of
married
life
on
slave
estates
but
i
have
undertaken
to
reply
to
the
statements
of
your
informant
and
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
record
the
facts
by
which
alone
i
can
do
so
continues
your
authority
at
six
in
the
morning
at
nine
an
hour
rest
was
allowed
for
breakfast
and
by
two
or
three
the
day
work
was
done
certainly
this
was
a
pattern
plantation
and
i
can
only
lament
that
my
experience
lay
amid
such
far
less
favourable
circumstances
the
negroes
among
whom
i
lived
went
to
the
fields
at
daybreak
carrying
with
them
their
allowance
of
food
which
toward
noon
and
not
till
then
they
ate
cooking
it
over
a
fire
which
they
kindled
as
best
they
could
where
they
were
working
their
meal
in
the
day
was
at
night
after
their
labour
was
over
having
worked
at
the
six
hours
without
rest
or
refreshment
since
their
meal
properly
so
called
indeed
for
it
was
meal
and
nothing
else
or
a
preparation
something
thicker
than
porridge
which
they
call
hominy
perhaps
the
candid
observer
whose
report
of
the
estate
he
visited
appeared
to
you
so
consolatory
would
think
that
this
diet
contrasted
favourably
with
that
of
potato
and
fed
irish
labourers
but
a
more
just
comparison
surely
would
be
with
the
mode
of
living
of
the
labouring
population
of
the
united
states
the
peasantry
of
ohio
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
or
indeed
with
the
condition
of
those
very
potato
and
fed
irishmen
when
they
have
exchanged
their
native
soil
for
the
fields
of
the
northern
and
states
and
when
as
one
of
them
once
was
heard
to
say
it
was
no
use
writing
home
that
he
got
meat
three
times
for
nobody
in
ireland
would
believe
it
the
next
item
in
the
list
of
commendation
is
the
hospital
which
your
informant
also
visited
and
of
which
he
gives
the
following
account
consisted
of
three
separate
wards
all
clean
and
well
ventilated
one
was
for
women
who
were
invariably
allowed
a
month
rest
after
their
confinement
permit
me
to
place
beside
this
picture
that
of
a
southern
infirmary
such
as
i
saw
it
and
taken
on
the
spot
in
the
first
room
that
i
entered
i
found
only
half
of
the
windows
of
which
there
were
six
glazed
these
were
almost
as
much
obscured
with
dirt
as
the
other
windowless
ones
were
darkened
by
the
dingy
shutters
which
the
shivering
inmates
had
closed
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
the
cold
in
the
enormous
chimney
glimmered
the
powerless
embers
of
a
few
chips
of
wood
round
which
as
many
of
the
sick
women
as
had
strength
to
approach
were
cowering
some
on
wooden
settles
there
was
not
such
a
thing
as
a
chair
with
a
back
in
the
whole
establishment
most
of
them
on
the
ground
excluding
those
who
were
too
ill
to
rise
and
these
poor
wretches
lay
prostrate
on
the
earth
without
bedstead
bed
mattress
or
pillow
with
no
covering
but
the
clothes
they
had
on
and
some
filthy
rags
of
blanket
in
which
they
endeavoured
to
wrap
themselves
as
they
lay
literally
strewing
the
floor
so
that
there
was
hardly
room
to
pass
between
them
here
in
their
hour
of
sickness
and
suffering
lay
those
whose
health
and
strength
had
given
way
under
unrequited
labour
some
of
them
no
later
than
the
previous
day
had
been
urged
with
the
lash
to
their
accustomed
tasks
and
their
husbands
fathers
brothers
and
sons
were
even
at
that
hour
sweating
over
the
earth
whose
increase
was
to
procure
for
others
all
the
luxuries
which
health
can
enjoy
all
the
comforts
which
can
alleviate
sickness
here
lay
women
expecting
every
hour
the
terror
and
agonies
of
others
who
had
just
brought
their
doomed
offspring
into
the
world
others
who
were
groaning
over
the
anguish
and
bitter
disappointment
of
miscarriages
here
lay
some
burning
with
fever
others
chilled
with
cold
and
aching
with
rheumatism
upon
the
hard
cold
ground
the
draughts
and
damp
of
the
atmosphere
increasing
their
sufferings
and
dirt
noise
stench
and
every
aggravation
of
which
sickness
is
capable
combined
in
their
condition
there
had
been
among
them
one
or
two
cases
of
prolonged
and
terribly
hard
labour
and
the
method
adopted
by
the
ignorant
old
negress
who
was
the
sole
matron
midwife
nurse
physician
surgeon
and
servant
of
the
infirmary
to
assist
them
in
their
extremity
was
to
tie
a
cloth
tight
round
the
throats
of
the
agonised
women
and
by
drawing
it
till
she
almost
suffocated
them
she
produced
violent
and
spasmodic
struggles
which
she
assured
me
she
thought
materially
assisted
the
progress
of
the
labour
this
was
one
of
the
southern
infirmaries
with
which
i
was
acquainted
and
i
beg
to
conclude
this
chapter
of
contrasts
to
your
informant
consolatory
views
of
slavery
by
assuring
you
once
more
very
emphatically
that
they
have
been
one
and
all
drawn
from
estates
where
the
slaves
esteemed
themselves
well
treated
were
reputed
generally
to
be
so
and
undoubtedly
as
far
as
my
observation
went
were
so
compared
with
those
on
several
of
the
adjoining
plantations
with
regard
to
the
statement
respecting
the
sums
of
money
earned
by
industrious
negroes
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
perfectly
correct
i
knew
of
some
slaves
on
a
plantation
in
the
extreme
south
who
had
received
at
various
times
large
sums
of
money
from
a
shopkeeper
in
the
small
town
near
their
estate
for
the
grey
moss
or
lichen
collected
from
the
evergreen
oaks
of
carolina
and
georgia
upon
which
it
hangs
in
vast
masses
and
after
some
cleaning
process
becomes
an
excellent
substitute
for
for
bed
chair
and
on
another
estate
some
of
the
slaves
were
expert
boat
makers
and
had
been
allowed
by
their
masters
to
retain
the
price
no
inconsiderable
one
for
some
that
they
had
found
time
to
manufacture
after
their
day
labour
was
accomplished
these
were
undoubtedly
privileges
but
i
confess
it
appears
to
me
that
the
juster
view
of
the
matter
would
be
this
if
these
men
were
industrious
enough
out
of
their
scanty
leisure
to
earn
these
sums
of
money
which
a
mere
exercise
of
arbitrary
will
on
the
part
of
the
master
allowed
them
to
keep
how
much
more
of
remuneration
of
comfort
of
improvement
physical
and
mental
might
they
not
have
achieved
had
the
due
price
of
their
daily
labour
merely
been
paid
to
them
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
mode
of
putting
the
case
to
englishmen
and
all
who
have
not
agreed
to
consider
uncertain
favour
an
equivalent
for
common
justice
in
the
dealings
of
man
with
man
as
the
slaves
are
well
known
to
toil
for
years
sometimes
to
amass
the
means
of
rescuing
themselves
from
bondage
the
fact
of
their
being
able
and
sometimes
allowed
to
earn
considerable
sums
of
money
is
notorious
but
now
that
i
have
answered
one
by
one
the
instances
you
have
produced
with
others
i
am
sure
as
accurate
and
i
believe
as
common
of
an
entirely
opposite
description
permit
me
to
ask
you
what
this
sort
of
testimony
amounts
to
i
allow
you
full
credit
for
yours
allow
me
full
credit
for
mine
and
the
result
is
very
simply
a
nullification
of
the
one
by
the
other
statement
and
a
proof
that
there
is
as
much
good
as
evil
in
the
details
of
slavery
but
now
be
pleased
to
throw
into
the
scale
this
consideration
that
the
principle
of
the
whole
is
unmitigated
abominable
evil
as
by
your
own
acknowledgement
you
hold
it
to
be
and
add
moreover
that
the
principle
being
invariably
bad
beyond
the
power
of
the
best
man
acting
under
it
to
alter
its
execrable
injustice
the
goodness
of
the
detail
is
a
matter
absolutely
dependent
upon
the
will
of
each
individual
slaveholder
so
that
though
the
best
can
not
make
the
system
in
the
smallest
particular
better
the
bad
can
make
every
practical
detail
of
it
as
atrocious
as
the
principle
itself
and
then
tell
me
upon
what
ground
you
palliate
a
monstrous
iniquity
which
is
the
rule
because
of
the
accidental
exceptions
which
go
to
prove
it
moreover
if
as
you
have
asserted
good
preponderates
over
evil
in
the
practice
though
not
in
the
theory
of
slavery
or
it
would
not
maintain
its
existence
why
do
you
uphold
to
us
with
so
much
complacency
the
hope
that
it
is
surely
if
not
rapidly
approaching
its
abolishment
why
is
the
preponderating
good
which
has
as
you
say
proved
sufficient
to
uphold
the
institution
hitherto
to
become
in
spite
of
the
spread
of
civilisation
and
national
progress
and
the
gradual
improvement
of
the
slaves
themselves
inadequate
to
its
perpetuation
henceforward
or
why
if
good
really
has
prevailed
in
it
do
you
rejoice
that
it
is
speedily
to
pass
away
you
say
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
is
inevitable
and
that
through
progressive
culture
the
negro
of
the
southern
states
daily
approaches
more
nearly
to
the
recovery
of
the
rights
of
which
he
has
been
robbed
but
whence
do
you
draw
this
happy
augury
except
from
the
hope
which
all
christian
souls
must
cherish
that
god
will
not
permit
much
longer
so
great
a
wickedness
to
darken
the
face
of
the
earth
surely
the
increased
stringency
of
the
southern
the
more
than
ever
vigilant
precautions
against
all
attempts
to
enlighten
or
educate
the
negroes
the
severer
restrictions
on
manumission
the
thrusting
forth
out
of
certain
states
of
all
free
persons
of
colour
the
atrocious
fugitive
slave
bill
one
of
the
latest
achievements
of
congress
and
the
piratical
attempts
upon
cuba
avowedly
on
the
part
of
all
southerners
abetting
or
justifying
it
because
it
will
add
and
slaves
to
their
possessions
surely
these
do
not
seem
indications
of
the
better
state
of
things
you
anticipate
except
indeed
as
the
straining
of
the
chain
beyond
all
endurable
tightness
significantly
suggests
the
probability
of
its
giving
way
i
do
not
believe
the
planters
have
any
disposition
to
put
an
end
to
slavery
nor
is
it
perhaps
much
to
be
wondered
at
that
they
have
not
to
do
so
is
in
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
them
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
their
property
perhaps
their
lives
for
a
benefit
which
they
profess
to
think
doubtful
to
the
slaves
themselves
how
far
they
are
right
in
anticipating
ruin
from
the
manumission
of
their
slaves
i
think
questionable
but
that
they
do
so
is
certain
and
for
the
sake
of
abstract
principle
is
not
a
thing
to
be
reasonably
expected
from
any
large
mass
of
men
but
besides
the
natural
fact
that
the
slaveholders
wish
to
retain
their
property
emancipation
is
in
their
view
of
it
not
only
a
risk
of
enormous
pecuniary
loss
and
of
their
entire
social
status
but
involves
elements
of
personal
danger
and
above
all
disgust
to
inveterate
prejudices
which
they
will
assuredly
never
encounter
the
question
is
not
alone
one
of
foregoing
great
wealth
or
the
mere
means
of
subsistence
in
either
case
almost
equally
hard
it
is
not
alone
the
unbinding
the
hands
of
those
who
have
many
a
bloody
debt
of
hatred
and
revenge
to
settle
it
is
not
alone
the
consenting
suddenly
to
see
by
their
side
upon
a
footing
of
free
social
equality
creatures
towards
whom
their
predominant
feeling
is
one
of
mingled
terror
and
abhorrence
and
who
during
the
whole
of
their
national
existence
have
been
as
the
earth
trampled
beneath
their
feet
yet
ever
threatening
to
gape
and
swallow
them
alive
it
is
not
all
this
alone
which
makes
it
unlikely
that
the
southern
planter
should
desire
to
free
his
slaves
freedom
in
america
is
not
merely
a
personal
right
it
involves
a
political
privilege
freemen
there
are
legislators
the
rulers
of
the
land
are
the
majority
of
the
people
and
in
many
parts
of
the
southern
states
the
black
free
citizens
would
become
if
not
at
once
yet
in
process
of
time
inevitably
voters
landholders
delegates
to
state
legislatures
members
of
assembly
who
knows
senators
judges
aspirants
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
you
must
be
an
american
or
have
lived
long
among
them
to
conceive
the
shout
of
derisive
execration
with
which
such
an
idea
would
be
hailed
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
that
the
emancipation
of
the
negroes
need
not
necessarily
put
them
in
possession
of
the
franchise
is
of
course
obvious
but
as
a
general
consequence
the
one
would
follow
from
the
other
and
at
present
certainly
the
slaveholders
are
no
more
ready
to
grant
the
political
privilege
than
the
natural
right
of
freedom
under
these
circumstances
though
the
utmost
commiseration
is
naturally
excited
by
the
slaves
i
agree
with
you
that
some
forbearance
is
due
to
the
masters
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
more
awful
position
than
theirs
fettered
by
laws
which
impede
every
movement
towards
right
and
justice
and
utterly
without
the
desire
to
repeal
them
dogged
by
the
apprehension
of
nameless
retributions
bound
beneath
a
burthen
of
responsibility
for
which
whether
they
acknowledge
it
or
not
they
are
held
accountable
by
god
and
men
goaded
by
the
keen
consciousness
of
the
growing
reprobation
of
all
civilised
christian
communities
their
existence
presents
the
miserable
moral
counterpart
of
the
physical
condition
of
their
slaves
and
it
is
one
compared
with
which
that
of
the
wretchedest
slave
is
in
my
judgement
worthy
of
envy
to
before
entering
upon
my
answer
to
your
questions
let
me
state
that
i
have
no
claim
to
be
ranked
as
an
abolitionist
in
the
american
acceptation
of
the
word
for
i
have
hitherto
held
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
to
be
exclusively
the
business
and
duty
of
their
owners
whose
highest
moral
interest
i
thought
it
was
to
rid
themselves
of
such
a
responsibility
in
spite
of
the
manifold
worldly
interests
almost
inextricably
bound
up
with
it
this
has
been
my
feeling
hitherto
with
regard
to
the
views
of
the
abolitionists
which
i
now
however
heartily
embrace
inasmuch
as
i
think
that
from
the
moment
the
united
states
government
assumed
an
attitude
of
coercion
and
supremacy
towards
the
southern
states
it
was
bound
with
its
fleets
and
armies
to
introduce
its
polity
with
respect
to
slavery
and
wherever
it
planted
the
standard
of
the
union
to
proclaim
the
universal
freedom
which
is
the
recognised
law
of
the
northern
united
states
that
they
have
not
done
so
has
been
partly
owing
to
a
superstitious
but
honourable
veneration
for
the
letter
of
their
great
charter
the
constitution
and
still
more
to
the
hope
they
have
never
ceased
to
entertain
of
bringing
back
the
south
to
its
allegiance
under
the
former
conditions
of
the
union
an
event
which
will
be
rendered
impossible
by
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
existence
of
slavery
the
north
with
the
exception
of
an
inconsiderable
minority
of
its
inhabitants
has
never
been
at
all
desirous
of
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
the
democratic
party
which
has
ruled
the
united
states
for
many
years
past
has
always
been
friendly
to
the
slaveholders
who
have
with
few
exceptions
been
all
members
of
it
for
by
a
strange
perversion
both
of
words
and
ideas
some
of
the
most
democratic
states
in
the
union
are
southern
slave
states
and
in
the
part
of
georgia
where
the
slave
population
is
denser
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
south
a
county
exists
bearing
the
satirical
title
of
and
the
support
of
the
south
has
been
given
to
the
northern
democratic
politicians
upon
the
distinct
understanding
that
their
institution
was
to
be
guaranteed
to
them
the
condition
of
the
free
blacks
in
the
northern
states
has
of
course
been
affected
most
unfavourably
by
the
slavery
of
their
race
throughout
the
other
half
of
the
union
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
a
difficult
matter
for
northern
citizens
to
maintain
towards
the
blacks
an
attitude
of
social
and
political
equality
as
far
as
the
borders
of
delaware
while
immediately
beyond
they
were
pledged
to
consider
them
as
the
of
their
owners
animals
no
more
noble
or
human
than
the
cattle
in
their
masters
fields
how
could
peace
have
been
maintained
if
the
southern
slaveholders
had
been
compelled
to
endure
the
sight
of
negroes
rising
to
wealth
and
eminence
in
the
northern
cities
or
entering
as
with
themselves
the
halls
of
that
legislature
to
which
all
citizens
are
eligible
they
would
very
certainly
have
declined
with
fierce
scorn
not
the
fellowship
of
the
blacks
alone
but
of
those
white
men
who
admitted
the
despised
race
of
their
serfs
to
a
footing
of
such
impartial
equality
it
therefore
was
the
instinctive
and
became
the
deliberate
policy
of
the
northern
people
once
pledged
to
maintain
slavery
in
the
south
to
make
their
task
easy
by
degrading
the
blacks
in
the
northern
states
to
a
condition
contrasting
as
little
as
possible
with
that
of
the
southern
slaves
the
northern
politicians
struck
hands
with
the
southern
slaveholders
and
the
great
majority
of
the
most
enlightened
citizens
of
the
northern
states
absorbed
in
the
pursuit
of
wealth
and
the
extension
and
consolidation
of
their
admirable
and
wonderful
national
prosperity
abandoned
the
government
of
their
noble
country
and
the
preservation
of
its
nobler
institutions
to
the
slaveholding
aristocracy
of
the
south
to
a
mob
of
politicians
by
trade
the
vilest
and
most
venal
class
of
men
that
ever
disgraced
and
endangered
a
country
to
foreign
emigrants
whose
brutish
ignorance
did
not
prevent
the
democratic
party
from
seizing
upon
them
as
voters
and
bestowing
on
the
irish
and
german
boors
just
landed
on
their
shores
the
same
political
privileges
as
those
possessed
and
intelligently
exercised
by
the
farmers
and
mechanics
of
new
england
the
most
enlightened
men
of
their
class
to
be
found
in
the
world
the
gradual
encroachment
of
the
southern
politicians
upon
the
liberties
of
the
north
by
their
unrelaxing
influence
in
congress
and
over
successive
cabinets
and
presidents
was
not
without
its
effect
in
stimulating
some
resistance
on
the
part
of
northern
statesmen
of
sufficient
intelligence
to
perceive
the
inevitable
results
towards
which
this
preponderance
in
the
national
counsels
was
steadily
tending
and
i
need
not
remind
you
of
the
rapidity
and
force
with
which
general
jackson
quelled
an
incipient
rebellion
in
south
carolina
when
calhoun
made
the
tariff
question
the
pretext
for
a
threatened
secession
in
of
the
opposition
to
southern
pretensions
by
john
quincy
adams
of
the
endeavour
of
clay
to
stem
the
growing
evil
by
the
conditions
of
the
missouri
compromise
and
all
the
occasional
attempts
of
individuals
of
more
conscientious
convictions
than
their
on
the
subject
of
the
sin
of
slavery
from
channing
eloquent
protest
on
the
annexation
of
texas
to
charles
sumner
philippic
against
brooks
of
south
carolina
the
disorganisation
of
the
democratic
party
after
a
cohesion
of
so
many
years
at
length
changed
the
aspect
of
affairs
and
the
north
appeared
to
be
about
to
arouse
itself
from
its
apathetic
consent
to
southern
domination
the
republican
party
headed
by
colonel
fremont
who
was
known
to
be
an
man
nearly
carried
the
presidential
election
six
years
ago
and
then
every
preparation
had
been
made
in
the
south
for
the
process
of
secession
which
was
only
averted
by
the
election
of
buchanan
a
southern
sympathiser
though
born
in
pennsylvania
under
his
presidency
the
southern
statesmen
resuming
their
attitude
of
apparent
friendliness
with
the
north
kept
in
abeyance
maturing
and
perfecting
by
every
treasonable
practice
for
which
their
preponderating
share
in
the
cabinet
afforded
them
fatal
facilities
the
plan
of
the
violent
disruption
of
the
union
upon
which
they
had
determined
whenever
the
republican
party
should
have
acquired
sufficient
strength
to
elect
a
president
with
northern
views
before
however
this
event
occurred
the
war
in
kansas
rang
a
prophetic
peal
of
warning
through
the
land
and
the
struggle
there
begun
between
new
england
emigrants
bent
on
founding
a
free
state
and
missouri
border
ruffians
determined
to
make
the
new
territory
a
slaveholding
addition
to
the
south
might
have
roused
the
whole
north
and
west
to
the
imminence
of
the
peril
by
which
the
safety
of
the
union
was
threatened
but
neither
the
struggle
in
kansas
nor
the
strange
and
piteous
episode
which
grew
out
of
it
of
john
brown
attempt
to
excite
an
insurrection
in
virginia
and
his
execution
by
the
government
of
that
state
did
more
than
startle
the
north
with
a
nine
days
wonder
out
of
its
apathetic
indifference
the
republican
party
it
is
true
gained
adherents
and
acquired
strength
by
degrees
and
buchanan
term
of
office
approaching
its
expiration
it
became
apparent
that
the
democratic
party
was
about
to
lose
its
supremacy
and
the
slaveholders
their
dominion
and
no
sooner
was
this
evident
than
the
latter
threw
off
the
mask
and
renounced
their
allegiance
to
the
union
in
a
day
in
an
hour
almost
those
stood
face
to
face
as
mortal
enemies
who
were
citizens
of
the
same
country
subjects
of
the
same
government
children
of
the
same
soil
and
the
north
incredulous
and
amazed
found
itself
suddenly
summoned
to
retrieve
its
lost
power
and
influence
and
assert
the
dignity
of
the
insulted
union
against
the
rebellious
attempt
of
the
south
to
overthrow
it
but
it
was
late
for
them
to
take
that
task
in
hand
for
years
the
conduct
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
been
becoming
a
more
desperate
and
degraded
one
from
which
day
by
day
the
northern
gentlemen
of
intelligence
influence
and
education
withdrew
themselves
in
greater
disgust
devoting
their
energies
to
schemes
of
mere
personal
advantage
and
leaving
the
commonweal
with
selfish
and
contemptuous
indifference
to
the
guidance
of
any
hands
less
nice
and
less
busy
than
their
own
nor
would
the
southern
planters
a
prouder
and
more
aristocratic
race
than
the
northern
merchants
have
relished
the
companionship
of
their
more
than
the
latter
but
personal
interests
were
at
stake
and
immediately
concerned
in
their
maintaining
their
predominant
influence
over
the
government
and
while
the
boston
men
wrote
and
talked
transcendentalism
and
became
the
most
accomplished
of
cotton
spinners
and
railroad
speculators
and
made
the
shoes
and
of
the
southerners
the
latter
made
their
laws
i
believe
new
jersey
is
really
the
great
factory
and
the
new
york
men
owners
of
the
fastest
horses
and
finest
houses
in
the
land
having
made
a
sort
of
brummagem
paris
of
their
city
were
the
bankers
and
brokers
of
the
southerners
while
the
latter
were
their
legislators
the
grip
the
slaveholders
had
fastened
on
the
helm
of
the
state
had
been
tightening
for
nearly
half
a
century
till
the
government
of
the
nation
had
become
literally
theirs
and
the
idea
of
their
relinquishing
it
was
one
which
the
north
did
not
contemplate
and
they
would
not
tolerate
if
i
have
said
nothing
of
the
grievances
which
the
south
has
alleged
against
the
north
its
tariff
made
chiefly
in
the
interest
of
the
manufacturing
states
or
its
inconsiderable
but
enthusiastic
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
abolition
party
it
is
because
i
do
not
believe
these
causes
of
complaint
would
have
had
the
same
effect
upon
any
but
a
community
of
slaveholders
men
made
impatient
by
the
habit
of
despotism
not
only
of
all
control
but
of
any
opposition
thirty
years
ago
andrew
jackson
a
man
of
keen
sagacity
as
well
as
determined
energy
wrote
of
them
that
they
were
bent
upon
destroying
the
union
and
that
whatever
was
the
pretext
of
their
discontent
that
was
their
aim
and
purpose
he
wrote
is
the
tariff
by
and
by
it
will
be
slavery
the
event
has
proved
how
true
a
prophet
he
was
my
own
conviction
is
that
the
national
character
produced
and
fostered
by
slaveholding
is
incompatible
with
free
institutions
and
that
the
southern
aristocracy
thanks
to
the
pernicious
influences
by
which
they
are
surrounded
are
unfit
to
be
members
of
a
christian
republic
it
is
slavery
that
has
made
the
southerners
rebels
to
their
government
traitors
to
their
country
and
the
originators
of
the
bloodiest
civil
war
that
ever
disgraced
humanity
and
civilisation
it
is
for
their
sinful
complicity
in
slavery
and
their
shameful
abandonment
of
all
their
duties
as
citizens
that
the
northerners
are
paying
in
the
blood
of
their
men
the
tears
of
their
women
and
the
treasure
which
they
have
till
now
held
more
precious
than
their
birthright
they
must
now
not
merely
impose
a
wise
restriction
upon
slavery
they
must
be
prepared
to
extinguish
it
they
neglected
and
despised
the
task
of
moderating
its
conditions
and
checking
its
growth
they
must
now
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
unparalleled
difficulties
and
dangers
be
ready
to
deal
summarily
with
its
entire
existence
they
have
loved
the
pursuit
of
personal
prosperity
and
pleasure
more
than
their
country
and
now
they
must
spend
life
and
living
to
reconquer
their
great
inheritance
and
win
back
at
the
sword
point
what
heaven
had
forbidden
them
to
lose
nor
are
we
here
in
england
without
part
in
this
tremendous
sin
and
sorrow
we
have
persisted
in
feeding
our
looms
and
the
huge
wealth
they
coin
with
the
produce
of
slavery
in
vain
our
vast
indian
territory
has
solicited
the
advantage
of
becoming
our
free
cotton
plantation
neither
our
manufacturers
nor
our
government
would
venture
would
wait
would
spend
or
lose
for
that
purpose
the
harvest
was
ready
was
abundant
was
cheap
and
now
the
thousand
arms
of
our
great
national
industry
are
folded
in
deplorable
inactivity
the
countless
hands
that
wrought
from
morn
till
night
the
wealth
that
was
a
world
wonder
are
stretched
unwillingly
to
beg
their
bread
and
england
has
never
seen
a
sadder
sight
than
the
enforced
idleness
of
her
poor
operatives
or
a
nobler
one
than
their
patient
and
heroic
endurance
and
now
you
ask
me
what
plan
what
scheme
what
project
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
formed
for
the
safe
and
successful
emancipation
of
four
millions
of
slaves
in
the
midst
of
a
country
distracted
with
all
the
horrors
of
war
and
the
male
population
of
which
is
engaged
in
military
service
at
a
distance
from
their
homes
most
assuredly
none
precipitated
headlong
from
a
state
of
apparent
profound
security
and
prosperity
into
a
series
of
calamitous
events
which
have
brought
the
country
to
the
verge
of
ruin
neither
the
nation
or
its
governors
have
had
leisure
to
prepare
themselves
for
any
of
the
disastrous
circumstances
they
have
had
to
encounter
least
of
all
for
the
momentous
change
which
the
proclamation
announces
as
imminent
a
measure
of
supreme
importance
not
deliberately
adopted
as
the
result
of
philanthropic
conviction
or
policy
but
if
not
a
mere
feint
of
party
politics
the
last
effort
of
the
incensed
spirit
of
endurance
in
the
north
a
punishment
threatened
against
rebels
whom
they
can
not
otherwise
subdue
and
which
a
year
ago
half
the
northern
population
would
have
condemned
upon
principle
and
more
than
half
revolted
from
on
instinct
the
country
being
in
a
state
of
war
necessarily
complicates
everything
and
renders
the
most
plausible
suggestions
for
the
settlement
of
the
question
of
emancipation
futile
because
from
first
to
last
now
it
will
be
one
tremendous
chapter
of
accidents
instead
of
a
carefully
considered
and
wisely
prepared
measure
of
government
but
supposing
the
war
to
have
ceased
either
by
the
success
of
the
northern
arms
or
by
the
consent
of
both
belligerents
the
question
of
manumission
in
the
southern
states
when
reduced
to
the
condition
of
territories
or
restored
to
the
sway
of
their
own
elected
governors
and
legislatures
though
difficult
is
by
no
means
one
of
insuperable
difficulty
and
i
do
not
believe
that
a
great
nation
of
englishmen
having
once
the
will
to
rid
itself
of
a
danger
and
a
disgrace
will
fail
to
find
a
way
the
thing
therefore
most
to
be
desired
now
is
that
americans
may
unanimously
embrace
the
purpose
of
emancipation
and
though
they
have
been
reluctantly
driven
by
the
irresistible
force
of
circumstances
to
contemplate
the
measure
may
henceforward
never
avert
their
eyes
from
it
till
it
is
accomplished
when
i
was
in
the
south
many
years
ago
i
conversed
frequently
with
two
highly
intelligent
men
both
of
whom
agreed
in
saying
that
the
immense
value
of
the
slaves
as
property
was
the
only
real
obstacle
to
their
manumission
and
that
whenever
the
southerners
became
convinced
that
it
was
their
interest
to
free
them
they
would
very
soon
find
the
means
to
do
it
in
some
respects
the
conditions
are
more
favourable
than
those
we
had
to
encounter
in
freeing
our
west
india
slaves
though
the
soil
and
climate
of
the
southern
states
are
fertile
and
favourable
they
are
not
tropical
and
there
is
no
profuse
natural
growth
of
fruits
or
vegetables
to
render
subsistence
possible
without
labour
the
winter
temperature
is
like
that
of
the
roman
states
and
even
as
far
south
as
georgia
and
the
borders
of
florida
frosts
severe
enough
to
kill
the
orange
trees
are
sometimes
experienced
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
states
throughout
by
far
the
largest
portion
of
their
extent
must
labour
to
live
and
will
undoubtedly
obey
the
beneficent
law
of
necessity
whenever
they
are
made
to
feel
that
their
existence
depends
upon
their
own
exertions
the
plan
of
a
gradual
emancipation
preceded
by
a
limited
apprenticeship
of
the
negroes
to
white
masters
is
of
course
often
suggested
as
less
dangerous
than
their
entire
and
immediate
enfranchisement
but
when
years
ago
i
lived
on
a
southern
plantation
and
had
opportunities
of
observing
the
miserable
results
of
the
system
on
everything
connected
with
it
the
souls
minds
bodies
and
estates
of
both
races
of
men
and
the
very
soil
on
which
they
existed
together
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
immediate
and
entire
emancipation
was
not
only
an
act
of
imperative
right
but
would
be
the
safest
and
most
profitable
course
for
the
interests
of
both
parties
the
gradual
and
inevitable
process
of
ruin
which
exhibits
itself
in
the
long
run
on
every
property
involving
slavery
naturally
suggests
some
element
of
decay
inherent
in
the
system
the
reckless
habits
of
extravagance
and
prodigality
in
the
masters
the
ruinous
wastefulness
and
ignorant
incapacity
of
the
slaves
the
deterioration
of
the
land
under
the
exhausting
and
thriftless
cultivation
to
which
it
is
subjected
made
it
evident
to
me
that
there
were
but
two
means
of
maintaining
a
prosperous
ownership
in
southern
plantations
either
the
possession
of
considerable
capital
wherewith
to
recruit
the
gradual
waste
of
the
energies
of
the
soil
and
supply
by
all
the
improved
and
costly
methods
of
modern
agriculture
the
means
of
profitable
cultivation
a
process
demanding
as
english
farmers
know
an
enormous
and
incessant
outlay
of
both
money
and
skill
or
an
unlimited
command
of
fresh
soil
to
which
the
slaves
might
be
transferred
as
soon
as
that
already
under
culture
exhibited
signs
of
exhaustion
now
the
southerners
are
for
the
most
part
men
whose
only
wealth
is
in
their
land
and
labourers
a
large
force
of
slaves
is
their
most
profitable
investment
the
great
capitalists
and
monied
men
of
the
country
are
northern
men
the
planters
are
men
of
large
estates
but
restricted
means
many
of
them
are
deeply
involved
in
debt
and
there
are
very
few
who
do
not
depend
from
year
to
year
for
their
subsistence
on
the
harvest
of
their
fields
and
the
chances
of
the
cotton
and
rice
crops
of
each
season
this
makes
it
of
vital
importance
to
them
to
command
an
unrestricted
extent
of
territory
the
man
who
can
move
a
of
negroes
to
a
tract
of
virgin
soil
is
sure
of
an
immense
return
of
wealth
as
sure
as
that
he
who
is
circumscribed
in
this
respect
and
limited
to
the
cultivation
of
certain
lands
with
cotton
or
tobacco
by
slaves
will
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
see
his
estate
gradually
exhausted
and
unproductive
refusing
its
increase
while
its
black
population
propagating
and
multiplying
will
compel
him
eventually
under
penalty
of
starvation
to
make
his
crop
and
substitute
as
the
virginians
have
been
constrained
to
do
a
traffic
in
human
cattle
for
the
cultivation
of
vegetable
harvests
the
steady
decrease
of
the
value
of
the
cotton
crop
even
on
the
famous
sea
island
plantations
of
georgia
often
suggested
to
me
the
inevitable
ruin
of
the
owners
within
a
certain
calculable
space
of
time
as
the
land
became
worn
out
and
the
negroes
continued
to
increase
in
number
and
had
the
estate
on
which
i
lived
been
mine
and
the
laws
of
georgia
not
made
such
an
experiment
impossible
i
would
have
emancipated
the
slaves
on
it
immediately
and
turned
them
into
a
free
tenantry
as
the
first
means
of
saving
my
property
from
impending
destruction
i
would
have
paid
them
wages
and
they
should
have
paid
me
rent
i
would
have
relinquished
the
charge
of
feeding
and
clothing
them
and
the
burthen
of
their
old
young
and
infirm
in
short
i
would
have
put
them
at
once
upon
the
footing
of
free
hired
labourers
of
course
such
a
process
would
have
involved
temporary
loss
and
for
a
year
or
two
the
income
of
the
estate
would
i
dare
say
have
suffered
considerably
but
in
all
such
diversions
of
labour
or
capital
from
old
into
new
channels
and
modes
of
operation
there
must
be
an
immediate
sacrifice
of
present
to
future
profit
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
estate
would
have
recovered
from
the
momentary
necessary
interruption
of
its
productiveness
to
resume
it
with
an
upward
instead
of
a
downward
tendency
and
a
vigorous
impulse
towards
progress
and
improvement
substituted
for
the
present
slow
but
sure
drifting
to
stagnation
and
decay
as
i
have
told
you
the
land
affords
no
spontaneous
produce
which
will
sustain
life
without
labour
the
negroes
therefore
must
work
to
eat
they
are
used
to
the
soil
and
climate
and
accustomed
to
the
agriculture
and
there
is
no
reason
at
all
to
apprehend
as
has
been
suggested
that
a
race
of
people
singularly
attached
to
the
place
of
their
birth
and
residence
would
abandon
in
any
large
numbers
their
own
country
just
as
the
conditions
of
their
existence
in
it
were
made
more
favourable
to
try
the
unknown
and
to
absolute
ignorance
forbidding
risks
of
emigration
to
the
sterner
climate
and
harder
soil
of
the
northern
states
of
course
in
freeing
the
slaves
it
would
be
necessary
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
their
becoming
eventual
proprietors
of
the
soil
to
some
extent
themselves
there
is
as
little
doubt
that
many
of
them
would
soon
acquire
the
means
of
doing
so
men
who
amass
during
hours
of
daily
extra
labour
through
years
of
unpaid
toil
the
means
of
buying
themselves
from
their
masters
would
soon
justify
their
freedom
by
the
intelligent
improvement
of
their
condition
as
that
many
of
the
present
landholders
would
be
ready
and
glad
to
alienate
their
impoverished
estates
by
parcels
and
sell
the
land
which
has
become
comparatively
unprofitable
to
them
to
its
enfranchised
cultivators
this
the
future
ownership
of
land
by
negroes
as
well
as
their
admission
to
those
rights
of
citizenship
which
everywhere
in
america
such
ownership
involves
would
necessarily
be
future
subjects
of
legislation
and
either
or
both
privileges
might
be
withheld
temporarily
indefinitely
or
permanently
as
might
seem
expedient
and
the
progress
in
civilisation
which
might
justify
such
an
extension
of
rights
these
and
any
other
modifications
of
the
state
of
the
black
population
in
the
south
would
require
great
wisdom
to
deal
with
but
their
immediate
transformation
from
bondsmen
to
free
might
i
think
be
accomplished
with
little
danger
or
difficulty
and
with
certain
increase
of
prosperity
to
the
southern
states
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
impossible
that
left
to
the
unimpeded
action
of
the
natural
laws
that
govern
the
existence
of
various
races
the
black
population
no
longer
directly
preserved
and
propagated
for
the
purposes
of
slavery
might
gradually
decrease
and
dwindle
as
it
does
at
the
north
where
besides
the
unfavourable
influence
of
a
cold
climate
on
a
race
originally
african
it
suffers
from
its
admixture
with
the
whites
and
the
amalgamation
of
the
two
races
as
far
as
it
goes
tends
evidently
to
the
destruction
of
the
weaker
the
northern
mulattoes
are
an
unhealthy
feeble
population
and
it
might
yet
appear
that
even
under
the
more
favourable
influence
of
a
southern
climate
whenever
the
direct
stimulus
afforded
by
slavery
to
the
increase
of
the
negroes
was
removed
their
gradual
extinction
or
absorption
by
the
predominant
white
race
would
follow
in
the
course
of
time
but
the
daily
course
of
events
appears
to
be
rendering
more
and
more
unlikely
the
immediate
effectual
enfranchisement
of
the
slaves
the
president
proclamation
will
reach
with
but
little
efficacy
beyond
the
mere
borders
of
the
southern
states
the
war
is
assuming
an
aspect
of
indefinite
duration
and
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
what
will
be
the
condition
of
the
blacks
freed
but
by
no
means
in
the
vast
interior
regions
of
the
southern
states
as
long
as
the
struggle
raging
all
round
their
confines
does
not
penetrate
within
them
each
of
the
combatants
is
far
too
busily
absorbed
in
the
furious
strife
to
afford
thought
leisure
or
means
either
effectually
to
free
the
slaves
or
effectually
to
replace
them
in
bondage
and
in
the
meantime
their
condition
is
the
worst
possible
for
the
future
success
of
either
operation
if
the
north
succeeds
in
subjugating
the
south
its
earliest
business
will
be
to
make
the
freedom
of
the
slaves
real
as
well
as
nominal
and
as
little
injurious
to
themselves
as
possible
if
on
the
other
hand
the
south
makes
good
its
pretensions
to
a
separate
national
existence
no
sooner
will
the
disseverment
of
the
union
be
an
established
fact
than
the
slaveholders
will
have
to
consolidate
once
more
the
system
of
their
institution
to
reconstruct
the
prison
which
has
half
crumbled
to
the
ground
and
rivet
afresh
the
chains
which
have
been
all
but
struck
off
this
will
be
difficult
the
determination
of
the
north
to
restrict
the
area
of
slavery
by
forbidding
its
ingress
into
future
territories
and
states
has
been
considered
by
the
slaveholders
a
wrong
and
a
danger
justifying
a
bloody
civil
war
inasmuch
as
if
under
those
circumstances
they
did
not
abolish
slavery
themselves
in
a
given
number
of
years
it
would
infallibly
abolish
them
by
the
increase
of
the
negro
population
hemmed
with
them
into
a
restricted
space
by
this
drawn
round
them
but
bad
as
this
prospect
has
seemed
to
slaveholders
determined
to
continue
such
and
justifying
as
it
may
be
conceded
that
it
does
from
their
point
of
view
not
a
ferocious
civil
war
but
a
peaceable
separation
from
states
whose
interests
were
declared
absolutely
irreconcileable
with
theirs
the
position
in
which
they
will
find
themselves
if
the
contest
terminates
in
favour
of
secession
will
be
undoubtedly
more
difficult
and
terrible
than
the
one
the
mere
anticipation
of
which
has
driven
them
to
the
dire
resort
of
civil
war
all
round
the
southern
coast
and
all
along
the
course
of
the
great
mississippi
and
all
across
the
northern
frontier
of
the
slave
states
the
negroes
have
already
thrown
off
the
trammels
of
slavery
whatever
their
condition
may
be
and
doubtless
in
many
respects
it
is
miserable
enough
they
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
free
vast
numbers
of
them
have
joined
the
northern
invading
armies
and
considerable
bodies
of
them
have
become
organised
as
soldiers
and
labourers
under
the
supervision
of
northern
officers
and
employers
most
of
them
have
learned
the
use
of
arms
and
possess
them
all
of
them
have
exchanged
the
insufficient
slave
diet
of
grits
and
rice
for
the
abundant
supplies
of
animal
food
which
the
poorest
labourer
in
that
favoured
land
of
cheap
provisions
and
high
wages
indulges
in
to
an
extent
unknown
in
any
other
country
none
of
these
slaves
of
yesterday
will
be
the
same
slaves
little
essential
difference
as
may
yet
have
been
effected
by
the
president
proclamation
in
the
interior
of
the
south
in
the
condition
of
the
blacks
it
is
undoubtedly
known
to
them
and
they
are
waiting
in
ominous
suspense
its
accomplishment
or
defeat
by
the
fortune
of
the
war
they
are
watching
the
issue
of
the
contest
of
which
they
well
know
themselves
to
be
the
theme
and
at
its
conclusion
end
how
it
will
they
must
be
emancipated
or
exterminated
with
the
north
not
only
not
friendly
to
slavery
but
henceforward
bitterly
hostile
to
slaveholders
and
no
more
to
be
reckoned
upon
as
heretofore
it
might
have
been
infallibly
by
the
southern
white
population
in
any
difficulty
with
the
blacks
a
fact
of
which
the
negroes
will
be
as
well
aware
as
their
former
masters
with
an
invisible
boundary
stretching
from
ocean
to
ocean
over
which
they
may
fly
without
fear
of
a
master
claim
following
them
a
single
inch
with
the
hope
and
expectation
of
liberty
suddenly
snatched
from
them
at
the
moment
it
seemed
within
their
grasp
with
the
door
of
their
dungeon
once
more
barred
between
them
and
the
light
into
which
they
were
in
the
act
of
emerging
is
it
to
be
conceived
that
these
four
millions
of
people
many
thousands
of
whom
are
already
free
and
armed
will
submit
without
a
struggle
to
be
again
thrust
down
into
the
hell
of
slavery
hitherto
there
has
been
no
insurrection
among
the
negroes
and
observers
friendly
and
inimical
to
them
have
alike
drawn
from
that
fact
conclusions
unfavourable
to
their
appreciation
of
the
freedom
apparently
within
their
grasp
but
they
are
waiting
to
see
what
the
north
will
really
achieve
for
them
the
liberty
offered
them
is
hitherto
anomalous
and
uncertain
enough
in
its
conditions
they
probably
trust
it
as
little
as
they
know
it
but
slavery
they
know
and
when
once
they
find
themselves
again
delivered
over
to
experience
there
will
not
be
one
insurrection
in
the
south
there
will
be
an
insurrection
in
every
state
in
every
county
on
every
plantation
a
struggle
as
fierce
as
it
will
be
futile
a
hopeless
effort
of
hopeless
men
which
will
baptise
in
blood
the
new
american
nation
and
inaugurate
its
birth
among
the
civilised
societies
of
the
earth
not
by
the
manumission
but
the
massacre
of
every
slave
within
its
borders
perhaps
however
jefferson
davis
means
to
free
the
negroes
whenever
that
consummation
is
attained
the
root
of
bitterness
will
have
perished
from
the
land
and
when
a
few
years
shall
have
passed
blunting
the
hatred
which
has
been
excited
by
this
fratricidal
strife
the
americans
of
both
the
northern
and
southern
states
will
perceive
that
the
selfish
policy
of
other
nations
would
not
have
so
rejoiced
over
their
division
had
it
not
seemed
to
those
who
loved
them
not
the
proof
of
past
failure
and
the
prophecy
of
future
weakness
admonished
by
its
terrible
experiences
i
believe
the
nation
will
reunite
itself
under
one
government
remodel
its
constitution
and
again
address
itself
to
fulfill
its
glorious
destiny
i
believe
that
the
country
sprung
from
ours
of
all
our
just
subjects
of
national
pride
the
greatest
will
resume
its
career
of
prosperity
and
power
and
become
the
noblest
as
well
as
the
mightiest
that
has
existed
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
