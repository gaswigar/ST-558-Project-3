as
introductory
i
wish
that
everybody
in
the
world
would
read
this
book
and
my
reasons
are
not
due
to
any
desire
on
my
part
that
people
should
join
any
group
of
social
philosophers
or
revolutionists
i
desire
that
the
book
be
widely
read
because
the
general
and
careful
reading
of
it
would
definitely
add
to
true
civilization
it
is
a
contribution
to
the
writings
which
promote
civilization
for
the
following
reasons
it
is
a
human
document
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
be
sincere
more
than
that
it
is
a
valuable
thing
to
be
so
means
unusual
qualities
of
the
heart
and
of
the
head
unusual
qualities
of
character
the
books
that
possess
this
quality
are
unusual
books
there
are
not
many
deliberately
autobiographical
writings
that
are
markedly
sincere
there
are
not
many
direct
human
documents
this
is
one
of
these
few
books
not
only
has
this
book
the
interest
of
the
human
document
but
it
is
also
a
striking
proof
of
the
power
of
the
human
soul
alexander
berkman
spent
fourteen
years
in
prison
under
perhaps
more
than
commonly
harsh
and
severe
conditions
prison
life
tends
to
destroy
the
body
weaken
the
mind
and
pervert
the
character
berkman
consciously
struggled
with
these
adverse
destructive
conditions
he
took
care
of
his
body
he
took
care
of
his
mind
he
did
so
strenuously
it
was
a
moral
effort
he
felt
insane
ideas
trying
to
take
possession
of
him
insanity
is
a
natural
result
of
prison
life
it
always
tends
to
come
this
man
felt
it
consciously
struggled
against
it
and
overcame
it
that
the
prison
affected
him
is
true
it
always
does
but
he
saved
himself
essentially
society
tried
to
destroy
him
but
failed
if
people
will
read
this
book
carefully
it
will
tend
to
do
away
with
prisons
the
public
once
vividly
conscious
of
what
prison
life
is
and
must
be
would
not
be
willing
to
maintain
prisons
this
is
the
only
book
that
i
know
which
goes
deeply
into
the
corrupting
demoralizing
psychology
of
prison
life
it
shows
in
picture
after
picture
sketch
after
sketch
not
only
the
obvious
brutality
stupidity
ugliness
permeating
the
institution
but
very
touching
it
shows
the
good
qualities
and
instincts
of
the
human
heart
perverted
demoralized
helplessly
struggling
for
life
beautiful
tendencies
basely
expressing
themselves
and
the
personality
of
berkman
goes
through
it
all
idealistic
courageous
uncompromising
sincere
truthful
not
untouched
as
i
have
said
by
his
surroundings
but
remaining
his
essential
self
what
lessons
there
are
in
this
book
like
all
truthful
documents
it
makes
us
love
and
hate
our
fellow
men
doubt
ourselves
doubt
our
society
tends
to
make
us
take
a
strenuous
serious
attitude
towards
life
and
not
be
too
quick
to
judge
without
going
into
a
situation
painfully
carefully
it
tends
to
complicate
the
present
simplicity
of
our
moral
attitudes
it
tends
to
make
us
more
mature
the
above
are
the
main
reasons
why
i
should
like
to
have
everybody
read
this
book
but
there
are
other
aspects
of
the
book
which
are
interesting
and
valuable
in
a
more
special
more
limited
way
aspects
in
which
only
comparatively
few
persons
will
be
interested
and
which
will
arouse
the
opposition
and
hostility
of
many
the
russian
nihilistic
origin
of
berkman
his
anarchistic
experience
in
america
his
attempt
on
the
life
of
frick
an
attempt
made
at
a
violent
industrial
crisis
an
attempt
made
as
a
result
of
a
sincere
if
fanatical
belief
that
he
was
called
on
by
his
destiny
to
strike
a
psychological
blow
for
the
oppressed
of
the
community
this
part
of
the
book
will
arouse
extreme
disagreement
and
disapproval
of
his
ideas
and
his
act
but
i
see
no
reason
why
this
with
the
rest
should
not
rather
be
regarded
as
an
integral
part
of
a
human
document
as
part
of
the
record
of
a
life
with
its
social
and
psychological
suggestions
and
explanations
why
not
try
to
understand
an
honest
man
even
if
he
feels
called
on
to
kill
there
too
it
may
be
deeply
instructive
there
too
it
has
its
lessons
read
it
not
in
a
combative
spirit
read
to
understand
do
not
read
to
agree
of
course
but

i
the
call
of
homestead
i
clearly
every
detail
of
that
day
is
engraved
on
my
mind
it
is
the
sixth
of
july
we
are
quietly
sitting
in
the
back
of
our
little
flat
fedya
and
i
when
suddenly
the
girl
enters
her
naturally
quick
energetic
step
sounds
more
than
usually
resolute
as
i
turn
to
her
i
am
struck
by
the
peculiar
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
the
heightened
color
have
you
read
it
she
cries
waving
the
newspaper
what
is
it
homestead
strikers
shot
pinkertons
have
killed
women
and
children
she
speaks
in
a
quick
jerky
manner
her
words
ring
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
animal
the
melodious
voice
tinged
with
the
harshness
of
bitterness
the
bitterness
of
helpless
agony
i
take
the
paper
from
her
hands
in
growing
excitement
i
read
the
vivid
account
of
the
tremendous
struggle
the
homestead
strike
or
more
correctly
the
lockout
the
report
details
the
conspiracy
on
the
part
of
the
carnegie
company
to
crush
the
amalgamated
association
of
iron
and
steel
workers
the
selection
for
the
purpose
of
henry
clay
frick
whose
attitude
toward
labor
is
implacably
hostile
his
secret
military
preparations
while
designedly
prolonging
the
peace
negotiations
with
the
amalgamated
the
fortification
of
the
homestead
the
erection
of
a
high
board
fence
capped
by
barbed
wire
and
provided
with
loopholes
for
sharpshooters
the
hiring
of
an
army
of
pinkerton
thugs
the
attempt
to
smuggle
them
in
the
dead
of
night
into
homestead
and
finally
the
terrible
carnage
i
pass
the
paper
to
fedya
the
girl
glances
at
me
we
sit
in
silence
each
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
only
now
and
then
we
exchange
a
word
a
searching
significant
look
ii
it
is
hot
and
stuffy
in
the
train
the
air
is
oppressive
with
tobacco
smoke
the
boisterous
talk
of
the
men
playing
cards
near
by
annoys
me
i
turn
to
the
window
the
gust
of
perfumed
air
laden
with
the
rich
aroma
of
hay
is
soothingly
invigorating
green
woods
and
yellow
fields
circle
in
the
distance
whirl
nearer
close
then
rush
by
giving
place
to
other
circling
fields
and
woods
the
country
looks
young
and
alluring
in
the
early
morning
sunshine
but
my
thoughts
are
busy
with
homestead
the
great
battle
has
been
fought
never
before
in
all
its
history
has
american
labor
won
such
a
signal
victory
by
force
of
arms
the
workers
of
homestead
have
compelled
three
hundred
pinkerton
invaders
to
surrender
to
surrender
most
humbly
ignominiously
what
humiliating
defeat
for
the
powers
that
be
does
not
the
pinkerton
janizary
represent
organized
authority
forever
crushing
the
toiler
in
the
interest
of
the
exploiters
well
may
the
enemies
of
the
people
be
terrified
at
the
unexpected
awakening
but
the
people
the
workers
of
america
have
joyously
acclaimed
the
rebellious
manhood
of
homestead
the
were
not
the
aggressors
resignedly
they
had
toiled
and
suffered
out
of
their
flesh
and
bone
grew
the
great
steel
industry
on
their
blood
fattened
the
powerful
carnegie
company
yet
patiently
they
had
waited
for
the
promised
greater
share
of
the
wealth
they
were
creating
like
a
bolt
from
a
clear
sky
came
the
blow
wages
were
to
be
reduced
peremptorily
the
steel
magnates
refused
to
continue
the
sliding
scale
previously
agreed
upon
as
a
guarantee
of
peace
the
carnegie
firm
challenged
the
amalgamated
association
by
the
submission
of
conditions
which
it
knew
the
workers
could
not
accept
foreseeing
refusal
it
flaunted
warlike
preparations
to
crush
the
union
under
the
iron
heel
perfidious
carnegie
shrank
from
the
task
having
recently
proclaimed
the
gospel
of
good
will
and
harmony
i
would
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
he
had
declared
that
there
is
no
excuse
for
a
strike
or
a
lockout
until
arbitration
of
differences
has
been
offered
by
one
party
and
refused
by
the
other
the
right
of
the
workingmen
to
combine
and
to
form
is
no
less
sacred
than
the
right
of
the
manufacturer
to
enter
into
association
and
conference
with
his
fellows
and
it
must
sooner
or
later
be
conceded
manufacturers
should
meet
their
men
than
with
smooth
words
the
great
philanthropist
had
persuaded
the
workers
to
indorse
the
high
tariff
every
product
of
his
mills
protected
andrew
carnegie
secured
a
reduction
in
the
duty
on
steel
billets
in
return
for
his
generous
contribution
to
the
republican
campaign
fund
in
complete
control
of
the
billet
market
the
carnegie
firm
engineered
a
depression
of
prices
as
a
seeming
consequence
of
a
lower
duty
but
market
price
of
billets
was
the
sole
standard
of
wages
in
the
homestead
the
wages
of
the
workers
must
be
reduced
the
offer
of
the
amalgamated
association
to
arbitrate
the
new
scale
met
with
contemptuous
refusal
there
was
nothing
to
arbitrate
the
men
must
submit
unconditionally
the
union
was
to
be
exterminated
and
carnegie
selected
henry
frick
the
bloody
frick
of
the
coke
regions
to
carry
the
program
into
execution
must
the
oppressed
forever
submit
the
manhood
of
homestead
rebelled
the
millmen
scorned
the
despotic
ultimatum
then
frick
hand
fell
the
war
was
on
indignation
swept
the
country
throughout
the
land
the
tyrannical
attitude
of
the
carnegie
company
was
bitterly
denounced
the
ruthless
brutality
of
frick
universally
execrated
i
could
no
longer
remain
indifferent
the
moment
was
urgent
the
toilers
of
homestead
had
defied
the
oppressor
they
were
awakening
but
as
yet
the
were
only
blindly
rebellious
the
vision
of
anarchism
alone
could
imbue
discontent
with
conscious
revolutionary
purpose
it
alone
could
lend
wings
to
the
aspirations
of
labor
the
dissemination
of
our
ideas
among
the
proletariat
of
homestead
would
illumine
the
great
struggle
help
to
clarify
the
issues
and
point
the
way
to
complete
ultimate
emancipation
my
days
were
feverish
with
anxiety
the
stirring
call
labor
awaken
would
fire
the
hearts
of
the
disinherited
and
inspire
them
to
noble
deeds
it
would
carry
to
the
oppressed
the
message
of
the
new
day
and
prepare
them
for
the
approaching
social
revolution
homestead
might
prove
the
first
blush
of
the
glorious
dawn
how
i
chafed
at
the
obstacles
my
project
encountered
unexpected
difficulties
impeded
every
step
the
efforts
to
get
the
leaflet
translated
into
popular
english
proved
unavailing
it
would
endanger
me
to
distribute
such
a
fiery
appeal
my
friend
remonstrated
impatiently
i
waived
aside
his
objections
as
if
personal
considerations
could
for
an
instant
be
weighed
in
the
scale
of
the
great
cause
but
in
vain
i
argued
and
pleaded
and
all
the
while
precious
moments
were
being
wasted
and
new
obstacles
barred
the
way
i
rushed
frantically
from
printer
to
compositor
begging
imploring
none
dared
print
the
appeal
and
time
was
fleeting
suddenly
flashed
the
news
of
the
pinkerton
carnage
the
world
stood
aghast
the
time
for
speech
was
past
throughout
the
land
the
toilers
echoed
the
defiance
of
the
men
of
homestead
the
had
rallied
bravely
to
the
defence
the
murderous
pinkertons
were
driven
from
the
city
but
loudly
called
the
blood
of
mammon
victims
on
the
hanks
of
the
monongahela
loudly
it
calls
it
is
the
people
calling
ah
the
people
the
grand
mysterious
yet
so
near
and
real
people
in
my
mind
i
see
myself
back
in
the
little
russian
college
town
amid
the
circle
of
petersburg
students
home
for
their
vacation
surrounded
by
the
halo
of
that
vague
and
wonderful
something
we
called
nihilist
the
rushing
train
homestead
the
five
years
passed
in
america
all
turn
into
a
mist
hazy
with
the
distance
of
unreality
of
centuries
and
again
i
sit
among
superior
beings
reverently
listening
to
the
impassioned
discussion
of
dimly
understood
high
themes
with
the
refrain
of
bazarov
hegel
liberty
chernishevsky
to
the
people
to
the
beautiful
simple
people
so
noble
in
spite
of
centuries
of
brutalizing
suffering
like
a
clarion
call
the
note
rings
in
my
ears
amidst
the
din
of
contending
views
and
obscure
phraseology
the
people
my
greek
mythology
moods
have
often
pictured
him
to
me
as
the
mighty
atlas
supporting
on
his
shoulders
the
weight
of
the
world
his
back
bent
his
face
the
mirror
of
unutterable
misery
in
his
eye
the
look
of
hopeless
anguish
the
dumb
pitiful
appeal
for
help
ah
to
help
this
helplessly
suffering
giant
to
lighten
his
burden
the
way
is
obscure
the
means
uncertain
but
in
the
heated
student
debate
the
note
rings
clear
to
the
people
become
one
of
them
share
their
joys
and
sorrows
and
thus
you
will
teach
them
yes
that
is
the
solution
but
what
is
that
misha
from
odessa
saying
it
is
all
good
and
well
about
going
to
the
people
but
the
energetic
men
of
the
deed
the
rakhmetovs
blaze
the
path
of
popular
revolution
by
individual
acts
of
revolt
against
ticket
please
a
heavy
hand
is
on
my
shoulder
with
an
effort
i
realize
the
situation
the
are
exchanging
angry
words
with
a
deft
movement
the
conductor
unhooks
the
board
and
calmly
walks
away
with
it
under
his
arm
a
roar
of
laughter
greets
the
players
twitted
by
the
other
passengers
they
soon
subside
and
presently
the
car
grows
quiet
i
have
difficulty
in
keeping
myself
from
falling
back
into
reverie
i
must
form
a
definite
plan
of
action
my
purpose
is
quite
clear
to
me
a
tremendous
struggle
is
taking
place
at
homestead
the
people
are
manifesting
the
right
spirit
in
resisting
tyranny
and
invasion
my
heart
exults
this
is
at
last
what
i
have
always
hoped
for
from
the
american
workingman
once
aroused
he
will
brook
no
interference
he
will
fight
all
obstacles
and
conquer
even
more
than
his
original
demands
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
heroic
past
reincarnated
in
the
of
homestead
pennsylvania
what
supreme
joy
to
aid
in
this
work
that
is
my
natural
mission
i
feel
the
strength
of
a
great
undertaking
no
shadow
of
doubt
crosses
my
mind
the
people
the
toilers
of
the
world
the
producers
comprise
to
me
the
universe
they
alone
count
the
rest
are
parasites
who
have
no
right
to
exist
but
to
the
people
belongs
the
earth
by
right
if
not
in
fact
to
make
it
so
in
fact
all
means
are
justifiable
nay
advisable
even
to
the
point
of
taking
life
the
question
of
moral
right
in
such
matters
often
agitated
the
revolutionary
circles
i
used
to
frequent
i
had
always
taken
the
extreme
view
the
more
radical
the
treatment
i
held
the
quicker
the
cure
society
is
a
patient
sick
constitutionally
and
functionally
surgical
treatment
is
often
imperative
the
removal
of
a
tyrant
is
not
merely
justifiable
it
is
the
highest
duty
of
every
true
revolutionist
human
life
is
indeed
sacred
and
inviolate
but
the
killing
of
a
tyrant
of
an
enemy
of
the
people
is
in
no
way
to
be
considered
as
the
taking
of
a
life
a
revolutionist
would
rather
perish
a
thousand
times
than
be
guilty
of
what
is
ordinarily
called
murder
in
truth
murder
and
are
to
me
opposite
terms
to
remove
a
tyrant
is
an
act
of
liberation
the
giving
of
life
and
opportunity
to
an
oppressed
people
true
the
cause
often
calls
upon
the
revolutionist
to
commit
an
unpleasant
act
but
it
is
the
test
of
a
true
revolutionist
nay
more
his
pride
to
sacrifice
all
merely
human
feeling
at
the
call
of
the
people
cause
if
the
latter
demand
his
life
so
much
the
better
an
act
of
political
assassination
could
anything
be
nobler
than
to
die
for
a
grand
a
sublime
cause
why
the
very
life
of
a
true
revolutionist
has
no
other
purpose
no
significance
whatever
save
to
sacrifice
it
on
the
altar
of
the
beloved
people
and
what
could
be
higher
in
life
than
to
be
a
true
revolutionist
it
is
to
be
a
a
complete
man
a
being
who
has
neither
personal
interests
nor
desires
above
the
necessities
of
the
cause
one
who
has
emancipated
himself
from
being
merely
human
and
has
risen
above
that
even
to
the
height
of
conviction
which
excludes
all
doubt
all
regret
in
short
one
who
in
the
very
inmost
of
his
soul
feels
himself
revolutionist
first
human
afterwards
such
a
revolutionist
i
feel
myself
to
be
indeed
far
more
so
than
even
the
extreme
radicals
of
my
own
circle
my
mind
reverts
to
a
characteristic
incident
in
connection
with
the
poet
edelstadt
it
was
in
new
york
about
the
year
edelstadt
one
of
the
tenderest
of
souls
was
beloved
by
every
one
in
our
circle
the
of
the
first
jewish
anarchist
organization
on
american
soil
one
evening
the
closer
personal
friends
of
edelstadt
met
to
consider
plans
for
aiding
the
sick
poet
it
was
decided
to
send
our
comrade
to
denver
some
one
suggesting
that
money
be
drawn
for
the
purpose
from
the
revolutionary
treasury
i
objected
though
a
dear
personal
friend
of
edelstadt
and
his
former
roommate
i
could
not
allow
i
argued
that
funds
belonging
to
the
movement
be
devoted
to
private
purposes
however
good
and
even
necessary
those
might
be
the
strong
disapproval
of
my
sentiments
i
met
with
this
challenge
do
you
mean
to
help
edelstadt
the
poet
and
man
or
edelstadt
the
revolutionist
do
you
consider
him
a
true
active
revolutionist
his
poetry
is
beautiful
indeed
and
may
indirectly
even
prove
of
some
propagandistic
value
aid
our
friend
with
your
private
funds
if
you
will
but
no
money
from
the
movement
can
be
given
except
for
direct
revolutionary
activity
do
you
mean
that
the
poet
is
less
to
you
than
the
revolutionist
i
was
asked
by
tikhon
a
young
medical
student
whom
we
playfully
dubbed
lingg
because
of
his
rather
successful
affectation
of
the
celebrated
revolutionist
physical
appearance
i
am
revolutionist
first
man
afterwards
i
replied
with
conviction
you
are
either
a
knave
or
a
hero
he
retorted
lingg
was
quite
right
he
could
not
know
me
to
his
mind
for
all
his
imitation
of
the
chicago
martyr
my
words
must
have
sounded
knavish
well
some
day
he
may
know
which
i
am
knave
or
revolutionist
i
do
not
think
in
the
term
hero
for
though
the
type
of
revolutionist
i
feel
myself
to
be
might
popularly
be
so
called
the
word
has
no
significance
for
me
it
merely
means
a
revolutionist
who
does
his
duty
there
is
no
heroism
in
that
it
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
revolutionist
should
do
rakhmetov
did
more
too
much
in
spite
of
my
great
admiration
for
chernishevsky
who
had
so
strongly
influenced
the
russian
youth
of
my
time
i
can
not
suppress
the
touch
of
resentment
i
feel
because
the
author
of
what
to
be
done
represented
his
rakhmetov
as
going
through
a
system
of
unspeakable
torture
to
prepare
himself
for
future
exigencies
it
was
a
sign
of
weakness
does
a
real
revolutionist
need
to
prepare
himself
to
steel
his
nerves
and
harden
his
body
i
feel
it
almost
a
personal
insult
this
suggestion
of
the
revolutionist
mere
human
clay
no
the
thorough
revolutionist
needs
no
such
preparations
for
i
know
do
not
need
them
the
feeling
is
quite
impersonal
strange
as
it
may
seem
my
own
individuality
is
entirely
in
the
background
aye
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
personality
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
cause
i
am
simply
a
revolutionist
a
terrorist
by
conviction
an
instrument
for
furthering
the
cause
of
humanity
in
short
a
rakhmetov
indeed
i
shall
assume
that
name
upon
my
arrival
in
pittsburgh
the
piercing
shrieks
of
the
locomotive
awake
me
with
a
start
my
first
thought
is
of
my
wallet
containing
important
addresses
of
allegheny
comrades
which
i
was
trying
to
memorize
when
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
the
wallet
is
gone
for
a
moment
i
am
overwhelmed
with
terror
what
if
it
is
lost
suddenly
my
foot
touches
something
soft
i
pick
it
up
feeling
tremendously
relieved
to
find
all
the
contents
safe
the
precious
addresses
a
small
newspaper
lithograph
of
frick
and
a
dollar
bill
my
joy
at
recovering
the
wallet
is
not
a
whit
dampened
by
the
meagerness
of
my
funds
the
dollar
will
do
to
get
a
room
in
a
hotel
for
the
first
night
and
in
the
morning
i
look
up
nold
or
bauer
they
will
find
a
place
for
me
to
stay
a
day
or
two
i
wo
remain
there
long
i
think
with
an
inward
smile
we
are
nearing
washington
the
train
is
to
make
a
stop
there
i
curse
the
stupidity
of
the
delay
something
may
be
happening
in
pittsburgh
or
homestead
besides
no
time
is
to
be
lost
in
striking
a
telling
blow
while
public
sentiment
is
aroused
at
the
atrocities
of
the
carnegie
company
the
brutality
of
frick
yet
my
irritation
is
strangely
dispelled
by
the
beautiful
picture
that
greets
my
eye
as
i
step
from
the
train
the
sun
has
risen
a
large
ball
of
deep
red
pouring
a
flood
of
gold
upon
the
capitol
the
cupola
rears
its
proud
head
majestically
above
the
pile
of
stone
and
marble
like
a
living
thing
the
light
palpitates
trembling
with
passion
to
kiss
the
uppermost
peak
striking
it
with
blinding
brilliancy
and
then
spreading
in
a
broadening
embrace
down
the
shoulders
of
the
towering
giant
the
amber
waves
entwine
its
flanks
with
soft
caresses
and
then
rush
on
to
right
and
left
wider
and
lower
flashing
upon
the
stately
trees
dallying
amid
leaves
and
branches
finally
unfolding
themselves
over
the
broad
avenue
and
ever
growing
more
golden
and
generous
as
they
scatter
and
giant
stately
trees
and
broad
avenue
quiver
with
ecstasy
all
nature
heaves
the
contented
sigh
of
bliss
and
nestles
closer
to
the
golden
giver
of
life
at
this
moment
i
realize
as
perhaps
never
before
the
great
joy
the
surpassing
gladness
of
being
but
in
a
trice
the
picture
changes
before
my
eyes
rises
the
monongahela
river
carrying
barges
filled
with
armed
men
and
i
hear
a
shot
a
boy
falls
to
the
gangplank
the
blood
gushes
from
the
centre
of
his
forehead
the
hole
ploughed
by
the
bullet
yawns
black
on
the
crimson
face
cries
and
wailing
ring
in
my
ears
i
see
men
running
toward
the
river
and
women
kneeling
by
the
side
of
the
dead
the
horrible
vision
revives
in
my
mind
a
similar
incident
lived
through
in
imagination
before
it
was
the
sight
of
an
executed
nihilist
the
nihilists
how
much
of
their
precious
blood
has
been
shed
how
many
thousands
of
them
line
the
road
of
russia
suffering
inexpressibly
near
and
i
feel
to
those
men
and
women
the
adored
mysterious
ones
of
my
youth
who
had
left
wealthy
homes
and
high
station
to
go
to
the
people
to
become
one
with
them
though
despised
by
all
whom
they
held
dear
persecuted
and
ridiculed
even
by
the
benighted
objects
of
their
great
sacrifice
clearly
there
flashes
out
upon
my
memory
my
first
impression
of
nihilist
russia
i
had
just
passed
my
second
year
gymnasium
examinations
overflowing
with
blissful
excitement
i
rushed
into
the
house
to
tell
mother
the
joyful
news
how
happy
it
will
make
her
next
week
will
be
my
twelfth
birthday
but
mother
need
give
me
no
present
i
have
one
for
her
instead
mamma
mamma
i
called
when
suddenly
i
caught
her
voice
raised
in
anger
something
has
happened
i
thought
mother
never
speaks
so
loudly
something
very
peculiar
i
felt
noticing
the
door
leading
from
the
broad
hallway
to
the
closed
contrary
to
custom
in
perturbation
i
hesitated
at
the
door
shame
on
you
nathan
i
heard
my
mother
voice
to
condemn
your
own
brother
because
he
is
a
nihilist
you
are
no
better
than
her
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
but
my
straining
ear
distinctly
caught
the
dread
word
uttered
with
hatred
and
fear
a
hangman
i
was
struck
with
terror
mother
tone
my
rich
uncle
nathan
unwonted
presence
at
our
house
the
fearful
word
something
awful
must
have
happened
i
tiptoed
out
of
the
hallway
and
ran
to
my
room
trembling
with
fear
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
what
has
the
done
i
moaned
brother
she
had
said
to
uncle
her
own
youngest
brother
my
favorite
uncle
maxim
oh
what
has
happened
to
him
my
excited
imagination
conjured
up
horrible
visions
there
stood
the
powerful
figure
of
the
giant
all
in
black
his
right
arm
bare
to
the
shoulder
in
his
hand
the
uplifted
ax
i
could
see
the
glimmer
of
the
sharp
steel
as
it
began
to
descend
slowly
so
torturingly
slowly
while
my
heart
ceased
beating
and
my
feverish
eyes
followed
bewitched
the
glowing
black
coals
in
the
head
suddenly
the
two
fiery
eyes
fused
into
a
large
ball
of
flaming
red
the
figure
of
the
fearful
cyclop
grew
taller
and
stretched
higher
and
higher
and
everywhere
was
the
giant
on
all
sides
of
me
was
he
then
a
sudden
flash
of
steel
and
in
his
monster
hand
i
saw
raised
a
head
cut
close
to
the
neck
its
eyes
incessantly
blinking
the
blood
gushing
from
mouth
and
ears
and
throat
something
looked
ghastly
familiar
about
that
head
with
the
broad
white
forehead
and
expressive
mouth
so
sweet
and
sad
oh
maxim
maxim
i
cried
the
next
moment
a
flood
of
passionate
hatred
of
the
seized
me
and
i
rushed
head
bent
toward
the
monster
nearer
and
nearer
i
came
another
quick
rush
and
then
the
violent
impact
of
my
body
struck
him
in
the
very
centre
and
he
fell
forward
and
heavy
right
upon
me
and
i
felt
his
fearful
weight
crushing
my
arms
my
chest
my
head
sasha
sashenka
what
is
the
matter
i
recognize
the
sweet
tender
voice
of
my
mother
sounding
far
away
and
strange
then
coming
closer
and
growing
more
soothing
i
open
my
eyes
mother
is
kneeling
by
the
bed
her
beautiful
black
eyes
bathed
in
tears
passionately
she
showers
kisses
upon
my
face
and
hands
entreating
what
is
it
mamma
what
happened
to
uncle
maxim
i
ask
breathlessly
watching
her
face
her
sudden
change
of
expression
chills
my
heart
with
fear
she
turns
ghostly
white
large
drops
of
perspiration
stand
on
her
forehead
and
her
eyes
grow
large
and
round
with
terror
mamma
i
cry
throwing
my
arms
around
her
her
lips
move
and
i
feel
her
warm
breath
on
my
cheek
but
without
uttering
a
word
she
bursts
into
vehement
weeping
who
told
you
you
know
she
whispers
between
sobs
the
pall
of
death
seems
to
have
descended
upon
our
home
the
house
is
oppressively
silent
everybody
walks
about
in
slippers
and
the
piano
is
kept
locked
only
monosyllables
in
undertone
are
exchanged
at
the
mother
seat
remains
vacant
she
is
very
ill
the
nurse
informs
us
no
one
is
to
see
her
the
situation
bewilders
me
i
keep
wondering
what
has
happened
to
maxim
was
my
vision
of
the
a
presentiment
or
the
echo
of
an
accomplished
tragedy
vaguely
i
feel
guilty
of
mother
illness
the
shock
of
my
question
may
be
responsible
for
her
condition
yet
there
must
be
more
to
it
i
try
to
persuade
my
troubled
spirit
one
afternoon
finding
my
eldest
brother
maxim
named
after
mother
favorite
brother
in
a
very
cheerful
mood
i
call
him
aside
and
ask
in
a
boldly
assumed
confidential
manner
maximushka
tell
me
what
is
a
nihilist
go
to
the
devil
you
he
cries
angrily
with
a
show
of
violence
quite
inexplicable
to
me
maxim
throws
his
paper
on
the
floor
jumps
from
his
seat
upsetting
the
chair
and
leaves
the
room
literally
a
contemptuous
term
applied
to
inexperienced
youth
the
fate
of
uncle
maxim
remains
a
mystery
the
question
of
nihilism
unsolved
i
am
absorbed
in
my
studies
yet
a
deep
interest
curiosity
about
the
mysterious
and
forbidden
slumbers
in
my
consciousness
when
quite
unexpectedly
it
is
roused
into
keen
activity
by
a
school
incident
i
am
fifteen
now
in
the
fourth
grade
of
the
classic
gymnasium
at
kovno
by
direction
of
the
ministry
of
education
compulsory
religious
instruction
is
being
introduced
in
the
state
schools
special
classes
have
been
opened
at
the
gymnasium
for
the
religious
instruction
of
jewish
pupils
the
parents
of
the
latter
resent
the
innovation
almost
every
jewish
child
receives
religious
training
at
home
or
in
but
the
school
authorities
have
ordered
the
gymnasiasts
of
jewish
faith
to
attend
classes
in
religion
schools
for
instruction
in
jewish
religion
and
laws
the
at
the
first
session
finds
me
missing
summoned
before
the
director
for
an
explanation
i
state
that
i
failed
to
attend
because
i
have
a
private
jewish
tutor
at
home
and
anyway
i
do
not
believe
in
religion
the
prim
director
looks
inexpressibly
shocked
young
man
he
addresses
me
in
the
artificial
guttural
voice
he
affects
on
solemn
occasions
young
man
when
permit
me
to
ask
did
you
reach
so
profound
a
conclusion
his
manner
disconcerts
me
but
the
sarcasm
of
his
words
and
the
offensive
tone
rouse
my
resentment
impulsively
defiantly
i
discover
my
cherished
secret
since
i
wrote
the
essay
is
no
god
i
reply
with
secret
exultation
but
the
next
instant
i
realize
the
recklessness
of
my
confession
i
have
a
fleeting
sense
of
coming
trouble
at
school
and
at
home
yet
somehow
i
feel
i
have
acted
like
a
uncle
maxim
the
nihilist
would
act
so
in
my
position
i
know
his
reputation
for
uncompromising
candor
and
love
him
for
his
bold
frank
ways
oh
that
is
interesting
i
hear
as
in
a
dream
the
unpleasant
guttural
voice
of
the
director
when
did
you
write
it
three
years
ago
how
old
were
you
then
twelve
have
you
the
essay
yes
where
at
home
bring
it
to
me
without
fail
remember
his
voice
grows
stern
the
words
fall
upon
my
ears
with
the
harsh
metallic
sound
of
my
sister
piano
that
memorable
evening
of
our
musicale
when
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
i
hid
a
piece
of
gas
pipe
in
the
instrument
tuned
for
the
occasion
then
you
are
dismissed
the
educational
board
in
conclave
assembled
reads
the
essay
my
disquisition
is
unanimously
condemned
exemplary
punishment
is
to
be
visited
upon
me
for
precocious
godlessness
dangerous
tendencies
and
insubordination
i
am
publicly
reprimanded
and
reduced
to
the
third
class
the
peculiar
sentence
robs
me
of
a
year
and
forces
me
to
associate
with
the
children
my
senior
class
looks
down
upon
with
undisguised
contempt
i
feel
disgraced
humiliated
thus
vision
chases
vision
memory
succeeds
memory
while
the
interminable
hours
creep
towards
the
afternoon
and
the
station
clock
drones
like
an
endless
old
woman
iii
over
at
last
all
aboard
on
and
on
rushes
the
engine
every
moment
bringing
me
nearer
to
my
destination
the
conductor
drawling
out
the
stations
the
noisy
going
and
coming
produce
almost
no
conscious
impression
on
my
senses
seeing
and
hearing
every
detail
of
my
surroundings
i
am
nevertheless
oblivious
to
them
faster
than
the
train
rushes
my
fancy
as
if
reviewing
a
panorama
of
vivid
scenes
apparently
without
organic
connection
with
each
other
yet
somehow
intimately
associated
in
my
thoughts
of
the
past
but
how
different
is
the
present
i
am
speeding
toward
pittsburgh
the
very
heart
of
the
industrial
struggle
of
america
america
i
dwell
wonderingly
on
the
unuttered
sound
why
in
america
and
again
unfold
pictures
of
old
scenes
i
am
walking
in
the
garden
of
our
country
place
in
a
fashionable
suburb
of
petersburg
where
the
family
generally
spends
the
summer
months
as
i
pass
the
veranda
semeonov
the
celebrated
physician
of
the
resort
steps
out
of
the
house
and
beckons
to
me
alexander
ossipovitch
he
addresses
me
in
his
courtly
manner
your
mother
is
very
are
you
alone
with
her
we
have
servants
and
two
nurses
are
in
attendance
i
reply
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
the
shadow
of
a
smile
hovers
about
the
corners
of
his
delicately
chiseled
lips
i
mean
of
the
family
oh
yes
i
am
alone
here
with
my
mother
your
mother
is
rather
restless
alexander
ossipovitch
could
you
sit
up
with
her
certainly
certainly
i
quickly
assent
wondering
at
the
peculiar
request
mother
has
been
improving
the
nurses
have
assured
me
my
presence
at
her
bedside
may
prove
irksome
to
her
our
relations
have
been
strained
since
the
day
when
in
a
fit
of
anger
she
slapped
rose
our
new
chambermaid
whereupon
i
resented
mother
right
to
inflict
physical
punishment
on
the
servants
i
can
see
her
now
erect
and
haughty
facing
me
across
the
her
eyes
ablaze
with
indignation
you
forget
you
are
speaking
to
your
mother
she
pronounces
the
name
in
four
distinct
syllables
as
is
her
habit
when
angry
with
me
you
have
no
right
to
strike
the
girl
i
retort
defiantly
you
forget
yourself
my
treatment
of
the
menial
is
no
concern
of
yours
i
can
not
suppress
the
sharp
reply
that
springs
to
my
lips
the
low
servant
girl
is
as
good
as
you
i
see
mother
long
slender
fingers
grasp
the
heavy
ladle
and
the
next
instant
a
sharp
pain
pierces
my
left
hand
our
eyes
meet
her
arm
remains
motionless
her
gaze
directed
to
the
spreading
blood
stain
on
the
white
the
ladle
falls
from
her
hand
she
closes
her
eyes
and
her
body
sinks
limply
to
the
chair
anger
and
humiliation
extinguish
my
momentary
impulse
to
rush
to
her
assistance
without
uttering
a
word
i
pick
up
the
heavy
saltcellar
and
fling
it
violently
against
the
french
mirror
at
the
crash
of
the
glass
my
mother
opens
her
eyes
in
amazement
i
rise
and
leave
the
house
my
heart
beats
fast
as
i
enter
mother
i
fear
she
may
resent
my
intrusion
the
shadow
of
the
past
stands
between
us
but
she
is
lying
quietly
on
the
bed
and
has
apparently
not
noticed
my
entrance
i
sit
down
at
the
bedside
a
long
time
passes
in
silence
mother
seems
to
be
asleep
it
is
growing
dark
in
the
room
and
i
settle
down
to
pass
the
night
in
the
chair
suddenly
i
hear
sasha
called
in
a
weak
faint
voice
i
bend
over
her
drink
of
water
as
i
hold
the
glass
to
her
lips
she
slightly
turns
away
her
head
saying
very
low
ice
water
please
i
start
to
leave
the
room
sasha
i
hear
behind
me
and
quickly
tiptoeing
to
the
bed
i
bring
my
face
closely
very
closely
to
hers
to
catch
the
faint
words
help
me
turn
to
the
wall
tenderly
i
wrap
my
arms
around
the
weak
emaciated
body
and
an
overpowering
longing
seizes
me
to
touch
her
hand
with
my
lips
and
on
my
knees
beg
her
forgiveness
i
feel
so
near
to
her
my
heart
is
overflowing
with
compassion
and
love
but
i
dare
not
kiss
her
we
have
become
estranged
affectionately
i
hold
her
in
my
arms
for
just
the
shadow
of
a
second
dreading
lest
she
suspect
the
storm
of
emotion
raging
within
me
caressingly
i
turn
her
to
the
wall
and
as
i
slowly
withdraw
i
feel
as
if
some
mysterious
yet
definite
something
has
at
the
very
instant
left
her
body
in
a
few
minutes
i
return
with
a
glass
of
ice
water
i
hold
it
to
her
lips
but
she
seems
oblivious
of
my
presence
she
can
not
have
gone
to
sleep
so
quickly
i
wonder
mother
i
call
softly
no
reply
little
mother
mamotchka
she
does
not
appear
to
hear
me
dearest
i
cry
in
a
paroxysm
of
sudden
fear
pressing
my
hot
lips
upon
her
face
then
i
become
conscious
of
an
arm
upon
my
shoulder
and
hear
the
measured
voice
of
the
doctor
my
boy
you
must
bear
up
she
is
at
rest
iv
wake
up
young
feller
whatcher
sighin
for
bewildered
i
turn
around
to
meet
the
coarse
yet
not
unkindly
face
of
a
swarthy
laborer
in
the
seat
back
of
me
oh
nothing
just
dreaming
i
reply
not
wishing
to
encourage
conversation
i
pretend
to
become
absorbed
in
my
book
how
strange
is
the
sudden
sound
of
english
almost
as
suddenly
had
i
been
transplanted
to
american
soil
six
months
passed
after
my
death
threatened
by
the
educational
authorities
with
a
passport
on
account
of
my
dangerous
tendencies
which
would
close
every
professional
avenue
to
me
in
spite
of
my
otherwise
very
satisfactory
standing
the
situation
aggravated
by
a
violent
quarrel
with
my
guardian
uncle
nathan
i
decided
to
go
to
america
there
beyond
the
ocean
was
the
land
of
noble
achievement
a
glorious
free
country
where
men
walked
erect
in
the
full
stature
of
manhood
the
very
realization
of
my
youthful
dreams
and
now
i
am
in
america
the
blessed
land
the
disillusionment
the
disappointments
the
vain
struggles
the
kaleidoscope
of
my
brain
unfolds
them
all
before
my
view
now
i
see
myself
on
a
bench
in
union
square
park
huddled
close
to
fedya
and
mikhail
my
roommates
the
night
wind
sweeps
across
the
cheerless
park
chilling
us
to
the
bone
i
feel
hungry
and
tired
fagged
out
by
the
day
fruitless
search
for
work
my
heart
sinks
within
me
as
i
glance
at
my
friends
nothing
each
had
morosely
reported
at
our
nightly
meeting
after
the
day
weary
tramp
fedya
groans
in
uneasy
sleep
his
hand
groping
about
his
knees
i
pick
up
the
newspaper
that
had
fallen
under
the
seat
spread
it
over
his
legs
and
tuck
the
ends
underneath
but
a
sudden
blast
tears
the
paper
away
and
whirls
it
off
into
the
darkness
as
i
press
fedya
hat
down
on
his
head
i
am
struck
by
his
ghastly
look
how
these
few
weeks
have
changed
the
plump
youth
poor
fellow
no
one
wants
his
labor
how
his
mother
would
suffer
if
she
knew
that
her
carefully
reared
boy
passes
the
nights
in
the
what
is
that
pain
i
feel
some
one
is
bending
over
me
looming
unnaturally
large
in
the
darkness
i
see
an
arm
swing
to
and
fro
with
short
semicircular
backward
strokes
and
with
every
movement
i
feel
a
sharp
sting
as
of
a
lash
oh
it
in
my
soles
bewildered
i
spring
to
my
feet
a
rough
hand
grabs
me
by
the
throat
and
i
face
a
policeman
are
you
thieves
he
bellows
mikhail
replies
sleepily
we
russians
want
work
git
out
o
here
off
with
you
quickly
silently
we
walk
away
fedya
and
i
in
front
mikhail
limping
behind
us
the
dimly
lighted
streets
are
deserted
save
for
a
hurrying
figure
here
and
there
closely
wrapped
flitting
mysteriously
around
the
corner
columns
of
dust
rise
from
the
gray
pavements
are
caught
up
by
the
wind
rushed
to
some
distance
then
carried
in
a
spiral
upwards
to
be
followed
by
another
wave
of
choking
dust
from
somewhere
a
tantalizing
odor
reaches
my
nostrils
the
bakery
on
second
street
fedya
remarks
unconsciously
our
steps
quicken
shoulders
raised
heads
bent
and
shivering
we
keep
on
to
the
lower
bowery
mikhail
is
steadily
falling
behind
dammit
i
feel
bad
he
says
catching
up
with
us
as
we
step
into
an
open
hallway
a
thorough
inspection
of
our
pockets
reveals
the
possession
of
twelve
cents
all
around
mikhail
is
to
go
to
bed
we
decide
handing
him
a
dime
the
cigarettes
purchased
for
the
remaining
two
cents
are
divided
equally
each
taking
a
few
puffs
of
the
fourth
in
the
box
fedya
and
i
sleep
on
the
steps
of
the
city
hall
the
harsh
cry
of
the
conductor
startles
me
with
the
violence
of
a
shock
impatient
as
i
am
of
the
long
journey
the
realization
that
i
have
reached
my
destination
comes
unexpectedly
overwhelming
me
with
the
dread
of
unpreparedness
in
a
flurry
i
gather
up
my
things
but
noticing
that
the
other
passengers
keep
their
places
i
precipitately
resume
my
seat
fearful
lest
my
agitation
be
noticed
to
hide
my
confusion
i
turn
to
the
open
window
thick
clouds
of
smoke
overcast
the
sky
shrouding
the
morning
with
sombre
gray
the
air
is
heavy
with
soot
and
cinders
the
smell
is
nauseating
in
the
distance
giant
furnaces
vomit
pillars
of
fire
the
lurid
flashes
accentuating
a
line
of
frame
structures
dilapidated
and
miserable
they
are
the
homes
of
the
workers
who
have
created
the
industrial
glory
of
pittsburgh
reared
its
millionaires
its
carnegies
and
fricks
the
sight
fills
me
with
hatred
of
the
perverse
social
justice
that
turns
the
needs
of
mankind
into
an
inferno
of
brutalizing
toil
it
robs
man
of
his
soul
drives
the
sunshine
from
his
life
degrades
him
lower
than
the
beasts
and
between
the
millstones
of
divine
bliss
and
hellish
torture
grinds
flesh
and
blood
into
iron
and
steel
transmutes
human
lives
into
gold
gold
countless
gold
the
great
noble
people
but
is
it
really
great
and
noble
to
be
slaves
and
remain
content
no
no
they
are
awakening
awakening
chapter
ii
the
seat
of
war
contentedly
peaceful
the
monongahela
stretches
before
me
its
waters
lazily
rippling
in
the
sunlight
and
softly
crooning
to
the
murmur
of
the
woods
on
the
hazy
shore
but
the
opposite
bank
presents
a
picture
of
sharp
contrast
near
the
edge
of
the
river
rises
a
high
board
fence
topped
with
barbed
wire
the
menacing
aspect
heightened
by
warlike
and
ramparts
the
sinister
wall
looks
down
on
me
with
a
thousand
hollow
eyes
whose
evident
murderous
purpose
fully
justifies
the
name
of
fort
frick
groups
of
excited
people
crowd
the
open
spaces
between
the
river
and
the
fort
filling
the
air
with
the
confusion
of
many
voices
men
carrying
winchesters
are
hurrying
by
their
faces
grimy
eyes
bold
yet
anxious
from
the
gape
the
black
mouths
of
cannon
dismantled
breastworks
bar
the
passages
and
the
ground
is
strewn
with
burning
cinders
empty
shells
oil
barrels
broken
furnace
stacks
and
piles
of
steel
and
iron
the
place
looks
the
aftermath
of
a
sanguinary
conflict
the
symbol
of
our
industrial
life
of
the
ruthless
struggle
in
which
the
the
sturdy
man
of
labor
is
always
the
victim
because
he
acts
but
the
charred
hulks
of
the
pinkerton
barges
at
the
and
the
gangplank
bear
mute
witness
that
for
once
the
battle
went
to
the
strong
to
the
victim
who
a
group
of
workingmen
approaches
me
big
stalwart
men
the
power
of
conscious
strength
in
their
step
and
bearing
each
of
them
carries
a
weapon
some
winchesters
others
shotguns
in
the
hand
of
one
i
notice
the
gleaming
barrel
of
a
navy
revolver
who
are
you
the
man
with
the
revolver
sternly
asks
me
a
friend
a
visitor
can
you
show
credentials
or
a
union
card
presently
satisfied
as
to
my
trustworthiness
they
allow
me
to
proceed
in
one
of
the

come
upon
a
dense
crowd
of
men
and
women
of
various
types

gesticulating
and
talking
rapidly
to
a
cluster
of
excited
countrymen
the
people
are
surging
about
a
raised
platform
on
which
stands
a
large
heavy
man

hope

many
voices

to
hell
with

the
tumult
drowns
the
words
of
the
sheriff
shaking
his
clenched
fist
his
foot
stamping
the
platform
he
shouts
at
the
crowd
but
his
voice
is
lost
amid
the
general
uproar
comes
from
several
sides
the
cry
swelling
into
a
tremendous
chorus
i
see
the
popular
leader
of
the
strike
nimbly
ascend
the
platform
the
assembly
becomes
hushed
brothers
begins
in
a
flowing
ingratiating
manner

interrupts
the
speaker
but
he
continues
you

show
the
world
that
you
desire
to
maintain
peace
and
order

pinkertons

us
welcome
them
as

applause
mixed
with
cries
of
impatient
disapproval
greets
the
exhortation
arms
are
raised
in
angry
argument
and
the
crowd
sways
back
and
forth
breaking
into
several
excited
groups
presently
a
tall
dark
man
appears
on
the
platform
his
stentorian
voice
gradually
draws
the
assembly
closer
to
the
front
slowly
the
tumult
subsides
do
you
believe
it
men
the
speaker
shakes
his
finger
at
the
audience
as
if
to
emphasize
his
warning

that
the
soldiers

coming
as
friends

let
the
soldiers
come
i
tell
you
first
come
then
the
blacklegs
you
want
no
no
roars
the
crowd
well
if
you
do
want
the
damned
scabs
keep
out
the
soldiers
you
understand
if
you
do
they
drive
you
out
from
the
homes
you
have
paid
for
with
your
blood
you
and
your
wives
and
children
they
drive
out
and
out
you
will
go
from
these
the
speaker
points
in
the
direction
of
the
mills
that
what
they
do
if
you
do
look
out
we
have
sweated
and
bled
in
these
mills
our
brothers
have
been
killed
and
maimed
there
we
have
made
the
damned
company
rich
and
now
they
send
the
soldiers
here
to
shoot
us
down
like
the
pinkerton
thugs
have
tried
to
and
you
want
to
welcome
the
murderers
do
you
keep
them
out
i
tell
you
amid
shouts
and
yells
the
speaker
leaves
the
platform
mcluckie
mcluckie
a
voice
is
heard
on
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
and
as
one
man
the
assembly
takes
up
the
cry
mcluckie
i
am
eager
to
see
the
popular
burgess
of
homestead
himself
a
poorly
paid
employee
of
the
carnegie
company
a
workingman
elbows
his
way
to
the
front
the
men
readily
making
way
for
him
with
nods
and
pleasant
smiles
i
have
prepared
any
speech
the
burgess
begins
haltingly
but
i
want
to
say
i
do
see
how
you
are
going
to
fight
the
soldiers
there
is
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
what
the
brother
before
me
said
but
if
you
stop
to
think
on
it
he
forgot
to
tell
you
just
one
little
thing
the
how
is
he
going
to
do
it
to
keep
the
soldiers
out
that
what
i
like
to
know
i
afraid
it
bad
to
let
them
in
the
blacklegs
be
hiding
in
the
rear
but
then
again
it
bad
to
let
the
soldiers
in
you
ca
stand
up
against
they
are
not
pinkertons
and
we
ca
fight
the
government
of
pennsylvania
perhaps
the
governor
wo
send
the
militia
but
if
he
does
i
reckon
the
best
way
for
us
will
be
to
make
friends
with
them
guess
it
the
only
thing
we
can
do
that
all
i
have
to
say
the
assembly
breaks
up
dejected
dispirited
chapter
iii
the
spirit
of
pittsburgh
i
like
a
gigantic
hive
the
twin
cities
jut
out
on
the
banks
of
the
ohio
heavily
breathing
the
spirit
of
feverish
activity
and
permeating
the
atmosphere
with
the
rage
of
life
ceaselessly
flow
the
streams
of
human
ants
meeting
and
diverging
their
paths
crossing
and
recrossing
leaving
in
their
trail
a
thousand
winding
passages
mounds
of
structure
peaked
and
domed
their
huge
shadows
overcast
the
yellow
thread
of
gleaming
river
that
curves
and
twists
its
painful
way
now
hugging
the
shore
now
hiding
in
affright
and
again
timidly
stretching
its
arms
toward
the
wrathful
monsters
that
belch
fire
and
smoke
into
the
midst
of
the
giant
hive
and
over
the
whole
is
spread
the
gloom
of
thick
fog
oppressive
and
dispiriting
the
symbol
of
our
existence
with
all
its
darkness
and
cold
this
is
pittsburgh

the
keynote
of
the
great
republic
dominating
all

sacrificing
harmony
to
noise
beauty
to
bulk
its
torch
of
liberty
is
a
furnace
fire
consuming
destroying
devastating
a
furnace
in
which
the
bones

of
the

their

their
health
and

are
cast
into
bessemer

rolled

a

house
looking
old
and
forlorn
it

occupied
by
the
widow
johnson
and
her
four
small
children
six
months
ago
the
breaking
of
a
crane
buried
her
husband
under
two
hundred
tons
of
metal
when
the
body
was
carried
into
the
house
the
distracted
woman
refused
to
recognize
in
the
mangled
remains
her
big
strong
jack
for
weeks
the
neighborhood
resounded
with
her
frenzied
cry
my
husband
where
my
husband
but
the
loving
care
of
neighbors
has
now
somewhat
restored
the
poor
woman
reason
accompanied
by
her
four
little
orphans
she
recently
gained
admittance
to
frick
on
her
knees
she
implored
him
not
to
drive
her
out
of
her
home
her
poor
husband
was
dead
she
pleaded
she
could
not
pay
off
the
mortgage
the
children
were
too
young
to
work
she
herself
was
hardly
able
to
walk
frick
was
very
kind
she
thought
he
had
promised
to
see
what
could
be
done
she
would
not
listen
to
the
neighbors
urging
her
to
sue
the
company
for
damages
the
crane
was
rotten
her
husband
friends
informed
her
the
government
inspector
had
condemned
it
but
frick
was
kind
and
surely
he
knew
best
about
the
crane
did
he
not
say
it
was
her
poor
husband
own
carelessness
she
feels
very
thankful
to
good
frick
for
extending
the
mortgage
she
had
lived
in
such
mortal
dread
lest
her
own
little
home
where
dear
john
had
been
such
a
kind
husband
to
her
be
taken
away
and
her
children
driven
into
the
street
she
must
never
forget
to
ask
the
blessing
upon
the
good
frick
every
day
she
repeats
to
her
neighbors
the
story
of
her
visit
to
the
great
man
how
kindly
he
received
her
how
simply
he
talked
with
her
just
like
us
folks
the
widow
says
she
is
now
telling
the
wonderful
story
to
neighbor
mary
the
hunchback
who
with
undiminished
interest
hears
the
recital
for
the
twentieth
time
it
reflects
such
importance
to
know
some
one
that
had
come
in
intimate
contact
with
the
iron
king
why
into
his
very
presence
and
even
talked
to
the
great
magnate

the
stately
trees
touch
their
shadows
across
the

gently
nodding
their

in

approval
a

the

passing
me
the
laughter
of

sounds
joyous
and
their
happiness
irritates
me
i
am
thinking
of
homestead
in
mind

see
the
sombre
fence
the
fortifications
and
cannon
the
piteous
figure
of
the
widow
rises
before
me
the
little
children
weeping
and
again
i
hear
the
anguished
cry
of
a
broken
heart
a
shattered
brain
and
here
all
is
joy
and
laughter
the
gentlemen
seem
pleased
the
ladies
are
happy
why
should
they
concern
themselves
with
misery
and
want
the
common
folk
are
fit
only
to
be
their
slaves
to
feed
and
clothe
them
build
these
beautiful
palaces
and
be
content
with
the
charitable
crust

what
i
give
you

here
is
his

there
it
is

so
much
misery

all

an
impersonal
conspiracy
perhaps
but
a
conspiracy

the
misery
of
the

to
probably
they
are
laughing
at

it
may
soon
be
our
turn
to
laugh
returning

evening
i
learn
that
the
conferences
between
the
carnegie
company
and
the

committee
of

have
terminated
in
the
final
refusal
of

attentat
the
door
of
frick
private
office
to
the
left
of
the
swings
open
as
the
colored
attendant
emerges
and
i
catch
a
flitting
glimpse
of
a
figure
at
a
table
in
the
back
of
the
room
mistah
frick
is
engaged
he
ca
see
you
now
sah
the
negro
says
handing
back
my
card
i
take
the
pasteboard
return
it
to
my
case
and
walk
slowly
out
of
the
but
quickly
retracing
my
steps
i
pass
through
the
gate
separating
the
clerks
from
the
visitors
and
brushing
the
astounded
attendant
aside
i
step
into
the
office
on
the
left
and
find
myself
facing
frick
for
an
instant
the
sunlight
streaming
through
the
windows
dazzles
me
i
discern
two
men
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
table
fr
i
begin
the
look
of
terror
on
his
face
strikes
me
speechless
it
is
the
dread
of
the
conscious
presence
of
death
he
understands
it
flashes
through
my
mind
with
a
quick
motion
i
draw
the
revolver
as
i
raise
the
weapon
i
see
frick
clutch
with
both
hands
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
attempt
to
rise
i
aim
at
his
head
perhaps
he
wears
armor
i
reflect
with
a
look
of
horror
he
quickly
averts
his
face
as
i
pull
the
trigger
there
is
a
flash
and
the
room
reverberates
as
with
the
booming
of
cannon
i
hear
a
sharp
piercing
cry
and
see
frick
on
his
knees
his
head
against
the
arm
of
the
chair
i
feel
calm
and
possessed
intent
upon
every
movement
of
the
man
he
is
lying
head
and
shoulders
under
the
large
armchair
without
sound
or
motion
dead
i
wonder
i
must
make
sure
about
feet
separate
us
i
take
a
few
steps
toward
him
when
suddenly
the
other
man
whose
presence
i
had
quite
forgotten
leaps
upon
me
i
struggle
to
loosen
his
hold
he
looks
slender
and
small
i
would
not
hurt
him
i
have
no
business
with
him
suddenly
i
hear
the
cry
murder
help
my
heart
stands
still
as
i
realize
that
it
is
frick
shouting
alive
i
wonder
i
hurl
the
stranger
aside
and
fire
at
the
crawling
figure
of
frick
the
man
struck
my
hand
i
have
missed
he
grapples
with
me
and
we
wrestle
across
the
room
i
try
to
throw
him
but
spying
an
opening
between
his
arm
and
body
i
thrust
the
revolver
against
his
side
and
aim
at
frick
cowering
behind
the
chair
i
pull
the
trigger
there
is
a
click
but
no
explosion
by
the
throat
i
catch
the
stranger
still
clinging
to
me
when
suddenly
something
heavy
strikes
me
on
the
back
of
the
head
sharp
pains
shoot
through
my
eyes
i
sink
to
the
floor
vaguely
conscious
of
the
weapon
slipping
from
my
hands
where
is
the
hammer
hit
him
carpenter
confused
voices
ring
in
my
ears
painfully
i
strive
to
rise
the
weight
of
many
bodies
is
pressing
on
me
now
it
frick
voice
not
dead
i
crawl
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
dragging
the
struggling
men
with
me
i
must
get
the
dagger
from
my
pocket
i
have
it
repeatedly
i
strike
with
it
at
the
legs
of
the
man
near
the
window
i
hear
frick
cry
out
in
pain
there
is
much
shouting
and
stamping
my
arms
are
pulled
and
twisted
and
i
am
lifted
bodily
from
the
floor
police
clerks
workmen
in
overalls
surround
me
an
officer
pulls
my
head
back
by
the
hair
and
my
eyes
meet
frick
he
stands
in
front
of
me
supported
by
several
men
his
face
is
ashen
gray
the
black
beard
is
streaked
with
red
and
blood
is
oozing
from
his
neck
for
an
instant
a
strange
feeling
as
of
shame
comes
over
me
but
the
next
moment
i
am
filled
with
anger
at
the
sentiment
so
unworthy
of
a
revolutionist
with
defiant
hatred
i
look
him
full
in
the
face
frick
do
you
identify
this
man
as
your
assailant
frick
nods
weakly
the
street
is
lined
with
a
dense
excited
crowd
a
young
man
in
civilian
dress
who
is
accompanying
the
police
inquires
not
unkindly
are
you
hurt
you
bleeding
i
pass
my
hand
over
my
face
i
feel
no
pain
but
there
is
a
peculiar
sensation
about
my
eyes
i
lost
my
glasses
i
remark
involuntarily
you
be
damn
lucky
if
you
do
lose
your
head
an
officer
retorts
chapter
v
the
third
degree
i
the
clanking
of
the
keys
grows
fainter
and
fainter
the
sound
of
footsteps
dies
away
the
officers
are
gone
it
is
a
relief
to
be
alone
their
insolent
looks
and
stupid
questions
insinuations
and
threats
how
disgusting
and
tiresome
it
all
is
a
sense
of
complete
indifference
possesses
me
i
stretch
myself
out
on
the
wooden
bench
running
along
the
wall
of
the
cell
and
at
once
fall
asleep
i
awake
feeling
tired
and
chilly
all
is
quiet
and
dark
around
me
is
it
night
my
hand
gropes
blindly
hesitantly
something
wet
and
clammy
touches
my
cheek
in
sudden
affright
i
draw
back
the
cell
is
damp
and
musty
the
foul
air
nauseates
me
slowly
my
foot
feels
the
floor
drawing
my
body
forward
all
my
senses
on
the
alert
i
clutch
the
bars
the
feel
of
iron
is
reassuring
pressed
close
to
the
door
my
mouth
in
the
narrow
opening
i
draw
quick
short
breaths
i
am
hot
perspiring
my
throat
is
dry
to
cracking
i
can
not
swallow
water
i
want
water
the
voice
frightens
me
was
it
i
that
spoke
the
sound
rolls
up
it
rises
from
gallery
to
gallery
and
strikes
the
opposite
corner
under
the
roof
now
it
crawls
underneath
knocks
in
the
distant
hollows
and
abruptly
ceases
holloa
there
whatcher
in
for
the
voice
seems
to
issue
at
once
from
all
sides
of
the
corridor
but
the
sound
relieves
me
now
the
air
feels
better
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
breathe
i
begin
to
distinguish
the
outline
of
a
row
of
cells
opposite
mine
there
are
dark
forms
at
the
doors
the
men
within
look
like
beasts
restlessly
pacing
their
cages
whatcher
in
for
it
comes
from
somewhere
alongside
ca
talk
eh
guess
what
am
i
in
for
oh
yes
it
frick
well
i
shall
not
stay
long
anyhow
they
will
soon
take
me
out
they
will
lean
me
against
a
wall
a
slimy
wall
like
this
perhaps
they
will
bandage
my
eyes
and
the
soldiers
there
no
they
are
going
to
hang
me
well
i
shall
be
glad
when
they
take
me
out
of
here
i
am
so
dry
i
suffocating
the
upright
irons
of
the
barred
door
grow
faint
and
melt
into
a
single
line
it
adjusts
itself
crosswise
between
the
upper
and
side
sills
it
resembles
a
scaffold
and
there
is
a
man
sinking
the
beam
into
the
ground
he
leans
it
carefully
against
the
wall
and
picks
up
a
spade
now
he
stands
with
one
foot
in
the
hole
it
is
the
carpenter
he
hit
me
on
the
head
from
behind
too
the
coward
if
he
only
knew
what
he
had
done
he
is
one
of
the
people
we
must
go
to
them
enlighten
them
i
wish
he
look
up
he
does
know
his
real
friends
he
looks
like
a
russian
peasant
with
his
broad
back
what
hairy
arms
he
has
if
he
would
only
look
up
now
he
sinks
the
beam
into
the
ground
he
is
stamping
down
the
earth
i
will
catch
his
eye
as
he
turns
around
ah
he
did
look
he
has
his
eyes
always
on
the
ground
just
like
the
now
he
is
taking
a
few
steps
backward
critically
examining
his
work
he
seems
pleased
how
peculiar
the
looks
the
horizontal
beam
seems
too
long
out
of
proportion
i
hope
it
break
i
remember
the
feeling
i
had
when
my
brother
once
showed
me
the
picture
of
a
man
dangling
from
the
branch
of
a
tree
underneath
was
inscribed
execution
of
stenka
did
the
branch
break
i
asked
no
sasha
mother
replied
stenka
well
he
weighed
nothing
and
i
wondered
at
the
peculiar
look
she
exchanged
with
maxim
but
mother
smiled
sadly
at
me
and
would
explain
then
she
turned
to
my
brother
maxim
you
must
not
bring
sashenka
such
pictures
he
is
too
young
not
too
young
mamotchka
to
learn
that
stenka
was
a
great
man
what
you
young
fool
father
bristled
with
anger
he
was
a
murderer
a
common
rioter
but
mother
and
maxim
bravely
defended
stenka
and
i
was
deeply
incensed
at
father
who
despotically
terminated
the
discussion
not
another
word
now
i
wo
hear
any
more
of
that
peasant
criminal
the
peculiar
divergence
of
opinion
perplexed
me
anybody
could
tell
the
difference
between
a
murderer
and
a
worthy
man
why
could
they
agree
he
must
have
been
a
good
man
i
finally
decided
mother
would
cry
over
a
hanged
murderer
i
saw
her
stealthily
wipe
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
that
picture
yes
stenka
razin
was
surely
a
noble
man
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
over
the
unspeakable
injustice
wondering
how
i
could
ever
forgive
them
the
killing
of
the
good
stenka
and
why
the
branch
did
not
break
with
his
weight
why
did
it
break
the
scaffold
they
will
prepare
for
me
might
break
with
my
weight
they
hang
me
like
stenka
and
perhaps
a
little
boy
will
some
day
see
the
picture
and
they
will
call
me
murderer
and
only
a
few
will
know
the
truth
and
the
picture
will
show
me
hanging
from
no
they
shall
not
hang
me
my
hand
steals
to
the
lapel
of
my
coat
and
a
deep
sense
of
gratification
comes
over
me
as
i
feel
the
cartridge
secure
in
the
lining
i
smile
at
the
imaginary
carpenter
useless
preparations
i
have
myself
prepared
for
the
event
no
they
hang
me
my
hand
caresses
the
long
narrow
tube
go
ahead
make
your
gallows
why
the
man
is
putting
on
his
coat
is
he
done
already
now
he
is
turning
around
he
is
looking
straight
at
me
why
it
frick
alive
my
brain
is
on
fire
i
press
my
head
against
the
bars
and
groan
heavily
alive
have
i
failed
failed
ii
heavy
footsteps
approach
nearer
the
clanking
of
the
keys
grows
more
distinct
i
must
compose
myself
those
mocking
unfriendly
eyes
shall
not
witness
my
agony
they
could
allay
this
terrible
uncertainty
but
i
must
seem
indifferent
would
i
take
lunch
with
the
chief
i
decline
requesting
a
glass
of
water
certainly
but
the
chief
wishes
to
see
me
first
flanked
on
each
side
by
a
policeman
i
pass
through
winding
corridors
and
finally
ascend
to
the
private
office
of
the
chief
my
mind
is
busy
with
thoughts
of
escape
as
i
carefully
note
the
surroundings
i
am
in
a
large
room
the
heavily
curtained
windows
built
unusually
high
above
the
floor
a
brass
railing
separates
me
from
the
desk

which
a
man
of
distinct
irish
type
is
engaged
with
some
papers

suppress
a
smile
at
the
stupidity
of
the
intended
trap

the
register
of
the
hotel
where

coax
and
threaten

smile
and
rage
in
turn
i
remain
indifferent
but
water
is
refused

my
thirst
aggravated
by
the
salty
food
they
have
given
me
it
consumes
me
it
tortures
and
burns
my
vitals
through
the
sleepless
nights
passed
on
the
hard
wooden
bench
the
foul
air
of
the
cell
is
stifling
the
silence
of
the
grave
torments
me
my
soul
is
in
an
agony
of
uncertainty
chapter

the
jail
i
the
days
ring
with
noisy
clamor
there
is
constant
going
and
coming
the
clatter
of
levers
the
slamming
of
iron
doors
continually
reverberates
through
the
corridors
the
dull
thud
of
a
footfall
in
the
cell
above
hammers
on
my
head
with
maddening
regularity
in
my
ears
is
the
yelling
and
shouting
of
coarse
voices
cell
to

a
prisoner
hurriedly
passes
my
door
his
step
is
nervous

luck
jimmie
the
man
flushes
and
averts
his
face
as
he
passes
a
group
of
visitors
clustered
about
an
overseer
who
is
that
officer
one
of
the
ladies
advances
lorgnette
in
hand
and
stares
boldly
at
the
prisoner
suddenly
she
shrinks
back
a
man
is
being
led
past
by
the
guards
his
face
is
bleeding
from
a
deep
gash
his
head
swathed
in
bandages
the
officers
thrust
him
violently
into
a
cell
he
falls
heavily
against
the
bed
oh
do
for
jesus
sake
do
the
shutting
of
the
heavy
door
drowns
his
cries
the
visitors
crowd
about
the

what
did
he
do

ca
come
out
now
officer
no
he
safe
the
lady
laugh
rings
clear
and
silvery
she
steps
closer
to
the
bars
eagerly
peering
into
the
darkness
a
smile
of
exciting
security
plays
about
her
mouth
what
has

disdainful
disappointment
is
on

row
this
way
ladies
ii
the
sun
is
slowly
nearing
the
blue
patch
of
sky
visible
from
my
cell
in
the
western
wing
of
the
jail
i
stand
close
to
the
bars
to
catch
the
cheering
rays
they
glide
across
my
face
with
tender
soft
caress
and
i
feel
something
melt
within
me
closer
i
press
to
the
door
i
long
for
the
precious
embrace
to
surround
me
to
envelop
me
to
pour
its
soft
balm
into
my
aching
soul
the
last
rays
are
fading
away
and
something
out
of
my
heart
is
departing
with
them
but
the
lengthening
shadows
on
the
gray
flagstones
spread
quiet
gradually
the
clamor
ceases
the
sounds
die
out
i
hear
the
creaking
of
rusty
hinges
there
is
the
click
of
a
lock
and
all
is
hushed
and
dark
the
silence
grows
gloomy
oppressive
it
fills
me
with
mysterious
awe
it
lives
it
pulsates
with
slow
measured
breathing
as
of
some
monster
it
rises
and
falls
approaches
recedes
it
is
misery
asleep
now
it
presses
heavily
against
my
door
i
hear
its
quickened
breathing
oh
it
is
the
guard
is
it
the
death
watch
his
outline
is
lost
in
the
but
i
see
the
whites
of
his
eyes
they
stare
at
me
they
watch
and
follow
me
i
feel
their
gaze
upon
me
as
i
nervously
pace
the
floor
unconsciously
my
step
quickens
but
i
can
not
escape
that
glint
of
steel
it
grimaces
and
mocks
me
it
dances
before
me
it
is
here
and
there
all
around
me
now
it
flits
up
and
down
it
doubles
trebles
the
fearful
eyes
stare
at
me
from
a
hundred
depressions
in
the
wall
on
every
side
they
surround
me
and
bar
my
way
i
bury
my
head
in
the
pillow
my
sleep
is
restless
and
broken
ever
the
terrible
gaze
is
upon
me
watching
watching
the
white
eyeballs
turning
with
my
every
movement
iii
the
line
of
prisoners
files
by
my
cell
they
walk
in
twos
conversing
in
subdued
tones

ends

of

with
quick
nervous
step
the
tall
slender
spaniard
swarthy
and
of
classic
feature
looks
about
him
with
suppressed
disdain
each
in
passing
casts
a
furtive
glance
into
my
cell
the
last
in
the
line
is
a
young
negro
walking
alone
he
nods
and
smiles
broadly
at
me
exposing
teeth
of
dazzling
whiteness
the
guard
brings
up

rear

pauses
at

that

membuh
dat
there
is
a
peculiar
movement
in
the
marching
line
i
notice
a
prisoner
leave
his
place
he
casts
an
anxious
glance
around
and
disappears
in
the
niche
of
the
cell
door
the
line
continues
on
its
march
and
as
i
near
the
man
hiding
place
i
hear
him
whisper
fall
back
aleck
surprised
at
being
addressed
in
such
familiar
manner
i
slow
down
my
pace
the
man
is
at
my
side
say
berk
you
do
want
to
be
seen
walking
with
that
the
sound
of
my
shortened
name
grates
harshly
on
my
ear
i
feel
the
impulse
to
resent
the
mutilation
the
man
manner
suggests
a
lack
of
respect
offensive
to
my
dignity
as
a
revolutionist
why
i
ask
turning
to
look
at
him
he
is
short
and
stocky
the
thin
lips
and
pointed
chin
of
the
elongated
face
suggest
the
fox
he
meets
my
gaze
with
a
sharp
look
from
above
his
spectacles
his
voice
is
husky
his
tone
unpleasantly
confidential
it
is
bad
for
a
white
man
to
be
seen
with
a
nigger
he
informs
me
it
will
make
feeling
against
me
he
himself
is
a
pittsburgh
man
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
he
was
born
and
raised
in
the
south
in
atlanta
they
have
no
use
for
niggers
down
there
he
assures
me
they
must
be
taught
to
keep
their
place
and
they
are
no
good
anyway
i
had
better
take
his
advice
for
he
is
friendly
disposed
toward
me
i
must
be
very
careful
of
appearances
before
the
trial
my
inexperience
is
quite
evident
but
he
knows
the
ropes
i
must
not
give
them
an
opportunity
to
say
anything
against
me
my
behavior
in
jail
will
weigh
with
the
judge
in
determining
my
sentence
he
himself
expects
to
get
off
easy
he
knows
some
of
the
judges
mostly
good
men
he
ought
to
know
helped
to
elect
one
of
them
voted
three
times
for
him
at
the
last
election
he
closes
the
left
eye
and
playfully
pokes
me
with
his
elbow
he
hopes
he
get
before
that
judge
he
will
if
he
is
lucky
he
assures
me
he
had
always
had
pretty
good
luck
last
time
he
got
off
with
three
years
though
he
nearly
killed
his
man
but
it
was
in
have
i
got
a
chew
of
tobacco
about
me
do
use
the
weed
well
it
be
easier
in
the
pen
what
the
pen
why
do
i
know
the
penitentiary
of
course
i
should
have
no
fear
frick
going
to
die
but
what
did
i
want
to
kill
the
man
for
i
ai
no
pittsburgh
man
that
he
could
see
plain
what
did
i
want
to
nose
in
for
help
the
strikers
i
must
be
crazy
to
talk
that
way
why
it
was
none
of
my
cheese
did
i
come
from
new
york
yes
well
then
how
could
the
strike
concern
me
i
must
have
some
personal
grudge
against
frick
ever
had
dealings
with
him
no
sure
then
it
plain
bughouse
no
use
talking
but
it
different
with
his
case
it
was
his
partner
in
business
he
knew
the
skunk
meant
to
cheat
him
out
of
money
and
they
quarreled
did
i
notice
the
dark
glasses
he
wears
well
his
eyes
are
bad
he
only
meant
to
scare
the
man
but
damn
him
he
croaked
curse
such
luck
his
third
offence
too
do
i
think
the
judge
will
have
pity
on
him
why
he
is
almost
blind
how
did
he
manage
to
get
his
man
why
just
an
accidental
shot
he
did
mean
to
the
gong
intones
its
deep
full
bass
all
in
the
line
breaks
there
is
a
simultaneous
clatter
of
many
doors
and
i
am
in
the
cell
again
iv
within
on
the
narrow
stool
i
find
a
tin
pan
filled
with
a
mixture
it
is
the
noon
meal
but
the
dinner
does
not
look
inviting
the
pan
is
old
and
rusty
the
smell
of
the
soup
excites
suspicion
the
greasy
surface
dotted
here
and
there
with
specks
of
vegetable
resembles
a
pool
of
stagnant
water
covered
with
green
slime
the
first
taste
nauseates
me
and
i
decide
to
dine
on
the
remnants
of
my
breakfast
a
piece
of
bread
i
pace
the
floor
in
agitation
over
the
conversation
with
my
why
ca
they
understand
the
motives
that
prompted
my
act
their
manner
of
pitying
condescension
is
aggravating
my
attempted
explanation
they
evidently
considered
a
waste
of
effort
not
a
striker
myself
i
could
and
should
have
had
no
interest
in
the
struggle
the
opinion
seemed
final
with
both
the
negro
and
the
white
man
in
the
purpose
of
the
act
they
refused
to
see
any
significance
nothing
beyond
the
mere
physical
effect
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
if
frick
had
died
because
he
was
bad
but
it
is
lucky
for
me
that
he
did
die
they
thought
for
now
they
hang
me
my
remark
that
the
probable
consequences
to
myself
are
not
to
be
weighed
in
the
scale
against
the
welfare
of
the
people
they
had
met
with
a
smile
of
derision
suggestive
of
doubt
as
to
my
sanity
it
is
of
course
consoling
to
reflect
that
neither
of
those
men
can
properly
be
said
to
represent
the
people
the
negro
is
a
very
inferior
type
of
laborer
and
the
other
he
is
a
in
business
he
is
not
worth
while
besides
he
confessed
that
it
is
his
third
offence
he
is
a
common
criminal
not
an
honest
producer
but
that
tall
man
the
homestead
whom
the
negro
pointed
out
to
me
oh
will
understand
he
is
of
the
real
people
my
heart
wells
up
in
admiration
of
the
man
as
i
think
of
his
participation
in
the
memorable
struggle
of
homestead
he
fought
the
pinkertons
the
myrmidons
of
capital
perhaps
he
helped
to
dynamite
the
barges
and
drive
those
hessians
out
of
town
he
is
tall
and
his
face
strong
and
determined
his
body
manly
and
powerful
he
is
of
the
true
spirit
the
embodiment
of
the
great
noble
people
the
giant
of
labor
grown
to
his
full
stature
conscious
of
his
strength
fearless
strong
and
proud
he
will
conquer
all
obstacles
he
will
break
his
chains
and
liberate
mankind
v
next
morning
during
exercise
hour
i
watch
with
beating
heart
for
an
opportunity
to
converse
with
the
homestead
i
shall
explain
to
him
the
motives
and
purpose
of
my
attempt
on
frick
he
will
understand
me
he
will
himself
enlighten
his
it
is
very
important
should
comprehend
my
act
quite
clearly
and
he
is
the
very
man
to
do
this
great
service
to
humanity
he
is
the
his
heroism
during
the
struggle
bears
witness
i
hope
the
people
will
not
allow
the
enemy
to
hang
him
he
defended
the
rights
of
the
homestead
workers
the
cause
of
the
whole
working
class
no
the
people
will
never
allow
such
a
sacrifice
how
well
he
carries
himself
erect
head
high
the
look
of
conscious
dignity
and
strength
cell
the
prisoner
with
the
smoked
glasses
leaves
the
line
and
advances
in
response
to
the
guard
call
quickly
i
pass
along
the
gallery
and
fall
into
the
vacant
place
alongside
of
the
a
happy
chance
i
address
him
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
about
something
important
you
are
one
of
the
homestead
strikers
are
you
not
jack
tinford
he
introduces
himself
what
your
name
he
is
visibly
startled
by
my
answer
the
man
who
shot
frick
he
asks
an
expression
of
deep
anxiety
crosses
his
face
his
eye
wanders
to
the
gate
through
the
wire
network
i
observe
visitors
approaching
from
the
warden
office
they
better
not
see
us
together
he
says
impatiently
fall
in
back
of
me
then
we
talk
pained
at
his
manner
yet
not
fully
realizing
its
significance
i
slowly
fall
back
his
tall
broad
figure
completely
hides
me
from
view
he
speaks
to
me
in
monosyllables
unwillingly
at
the
mention
of
homestead
he
grows
more
communicative
talking
in
an
undertone
as
if
conversing
with
his
neighbor
the
sicilian
who
does
not
understand
a
syllable
of
english
i
strain
my
ear
to
catch
his
words
the
merely
defended
themselves
against
armed
invaders
i
hear
him
say
they
are
not
on
strike
they
been
locked
out
by
frick
because
he
wants
to
the
works
that
why
he
broke
the
contract
with
the
amalgamated
and
hired
the
damned
pinkertons
two
months
before
when
all
was
peace
they
shot
many
workers
from
the
barges
before
the
millmen
got
after
them
they
deserved
roasting
alive
for
their
unprovoked
murders
well
the
men
fixed
them
all
right
some
were
killed
others
committed
suicide
on
the
burning
barges
and
the
rest
were
forced
to
surrender
like
whipped
curs
a
grand
victory
all
right
if
that
coward
of
a
sheriff
had
got
the
governor
to
send
the
militia
to
homestead
but
it
was
a
victory
you
bet
for
the
boys
to
get
the
best
of
three
hundred
armed
pinkertons
he
himself
though
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fight
he
was
sick
at
the
time
they
trying
to
get
the
pinkertons
to
swear
his
life
away
one
of
the
hounds
has
already
made
an
affidavit
that
he
saw
him
jack
tinford
throw
dynamite
at
the
barges
before
the
pinkertons
landed
but
never
mind
he
is
not
afraid
no
pittsburgh
jury
will
believe
those
lying
murderers
he
was
in
his
sweetheart
house
sick
abed
the
girl
and
her
mother
will
prove
an
alibi
for
him
and
the
advisory
committee
of
the
amalgamated
too
they
know
he
was
on
the
shore
they
swear
to
it
in
court
anyhow
abruptly
he
ceases
a
look
of
fear
on
his
face
for
a
moment
he
is
lost
in
thought
then
he
gives
me
a
searching
look
and
smiles
at
me
as
we
turn
the
corner
of
the
walk
he
whispers
too
bad
you
did
kill
him
some
business
misunderstanding
eh
he
adds
aloud
could
he
be
serious
i
wonder
does
he
only
pretend
he
faces
straight
ahead
and
i
am
unable
to
see
his
expression
i
begin
the
careful
explanation
i
had
prepared
jack
it
was
for
you
for
your
people
that
i
impatiently
angrily
he
interrupts
me
i
better
be
careful
not
to
talk
that
way
in
court
he
warns
me
if
frick
should
die
i
hang
myself
with
such
gab
and
it
would
only
harm
the
they
believe
in
killing
they
respect
the
law
of
course
they
had
a
right
to
defend
their
homes
and
families
against
unlawful
invaders
but
they
welcomed
the
militia
to
homestead
they
showed
their
respect
for
authority
to
be
sure
frick
deserves
to
die
he
is
a
murderer
but
the
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
anarchists
what
did
i
want
to
kill
him
for
anyhow
i
did
not
belong
to
the
homestead
men
it
was
none
of
my
business
i
had
better
not
say
anything
about
it
in
court
or
the
gong
tolls
all
in
vi
i
pass
a
sleepless
night
the
events
of
the
day
have
stirred
me
to
the
very
depths
bitterness
and
anger
against
the
homestead
striker
fill
my
heart
my
hero
of
yesterday
the
hero
of
the
glorious
struggle
of
the
people
how
contemptible
he
has
proved
himself
how
cravenly
small
no
consciousness
of
the
great
mission
of
his
class
no
proud
realization
of
the
part
he
himself
had
acted
in
the
noble
struggle
a
cowardly
overgrown
boy
terrified
at
punishment
for
the
prank
he
has
played
meanly
concerned
only
with
his
own
safety
and
willing
to
resort
to
lying
in
order
to
escape
responsibility
the
very
thought
is
appalling
it
is
a
sacrilege
an
insult
to
the
holy
cause
to
the
people
to
myself
too
not
that
lying
is
to
be
condemned
provided
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
cause
all
means
are
justified
in
the
war
of
humanity
against
its
enemies
indeed
the
more
repugnant
the
means
the
stronger
the
test
of
one
nobility
and
devotion
all
great
revolutionists
have
proved
that
there
is
no
more
striking
example
in
the
annals
of
the
russian
movement
than
that
peerless
nihilist
what
was
his
name
why
how
peculiar
that
it
should
escape
me
just
now
i
knew
it
so
well
he
undermined
the
winter
palace
beneath
the
very
of
the
tsar
what
debasement
what
terrible
indignities
he
had
to
endure
in
the
rôle
of
the
servile
peasant
carpenter
how
his
proud
spirit
must
have
suffered
for
weeks
and
months
all
for
the
sake
of
his
great
purpose
wonderful
man
to
be
worthy
of
your
comradeship
but
this
homestead
worker
what
a
pigmy
by
comparison
he
is
absorbed
in
the
single
thought
of
saving
himself
the
traitor
a
veritable
judas
preparing
to
forswear
his
people
and
their
cause
willing
to
lie
and
deny
his
participation
how
proud
i
should
be
in
his
place
to
have
fought
on
the
barricades
as
he
did
and
then
to
die
for
it
ah
could
there
be
a
more
glorious
fate
for
a
man
a
real
man
to
serve
even
as
the
least
stone
in
the
foundation
of
a
free
society
or
as
a
plank
in
the
bridge
across
which
the
triumphant
people
shall
finally
pass
into
the
land
of
promise
a
plank
in
the
bridge
in
the
what
a
significant
name
how
it
impressed
me
the
first
time
i
heard
it
no
i
saw
it
in
print
i
remember
quite
clearly
mother
had
just
died
i
was
dreaming
of
the
new
world
the
land
of
freedom
eagerly
i
read
every
line
of
american
news
one
day
in
the
little
kovno
library
how
distinctly
it
all
comes
back
to
me
i
can
see
myself
sitting
there
perusing
the
papers
must
get
acquainted
with
the
country
what
is
this
anarchists
hanged
in
chicago
there
are
many
names
one
is
most
what
is
an
anarchist
i
whisper
to
the
student
near
by
he
is
from
peter
he
will
know
s
sh
same
as
nihilists
in
free
america
i
wondered
russian
for
bridge
popular
abbreviation
of
petersburg
how
little
i
knew
of
america
then
a
free
country
indeed
that
hangs
its
noblest
men
and
the
misery
the
exploitation
it
terrible
i
must
mention
all
this
in
court
in
my
defence
no
not
defence
some
fitter
word
explanation
yes
my
explanation
i
need
no
defence
i
do
consider
myself
guilty
what
did
the
warden
mean
fool
for
a
client
he
said
when
i
told
him
that
i
would
refuse
legal
aid
he
thinks
i
am
a
fool
well
he
a
he
ca
understand
tell
him
to
leave
me
alone
he
belongs
to
the
enemy
the
lawyers
too
they
are
all
in
the
capitalist
camp
i
need
no
lawyers
they
explain
my
case
i
shall
not
talk
to
the
reporters
either
they
are
a
lying
pack
those
journalistic
hounds
of
capitalism
they
always
misrepresent
us
and
they
know
better
too
they
wrote
columns
of
interviews
with
most
when
he
went
to
prison
all
lies
i
saw
him
off
myself
he
did
say
a
word
to
them
they
are
our
worst
enemies
the
warden
said
that
they
come
to
see
me
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
they
sure
to
twist
my
words
and
thus
impair
the
effect
of
my
act
it
is
not
complete
without
my
explanation
i
shall
prepare
it
very
carefully
of
course
the
jury
wo
understand
they
too
belong
to
the
capitalist
class
but
i
must
use
the
trial
to
talk
to
the
people
to
be
sure
an
on
a
frick
is
in
itself
splendid
propaganda
it
combines
the
value
of
example
with
terroristic
effect
but
very
much
depends
upon
my
explanation
it
offers
me
a
rare
opportunity
for
a
broader
agitation
of
our
ideas
the
comrades
outside
will
also
use
my
act
for
propaganda
the
people
misunderstand
us
they
have
been
prejudiced
by
the
capitalist
press
they
must
be
enlightened
that
is
our
glorious
task
very
difficult
and
slow
work
it
is
true
but
they
will
learn
their
patience
will
break
and
then
the
good
people
they
have
always
been
too
kind
to
their
enemies
and
brave
even
in
their
suffering
yes
very
brave
not
like
that
fellow
the
he
is
a
disgrace
to
homestead
the
traitor
i
pace
the
cell
in
agitation
the
is
not
fit
to
live
perhaps
it
would
be
best
they
should
hang
him
his
death
would
help
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
people
to
the
real
character
of
legal
justice
legal
justice
what
a
travesty
they
are
mutually
exclusive
terms
yes
indeed
it
would
be
best
he
should
be
hanged
the
pinkerton
will
testify
against
him
he
saw
jack
throw
dynamite
very
good
perhaps
others
will
also
swear
to
it
the
judge
will
believe
the
pinkertons
yes
they
will
hang
him
the
thought
somewhat
soothes
my
perturbation
at
least
the
cause
of
the
people
will
benefit
to
some
extent
the
man
himself
is
not
to
be
considered
he
has
ceased
to
exist
his
interests
are
exclusively
personal
he
can
be
of
no
further
benefit
to
the
people
only
his
death
can
aid
the
cause
it
is
best
for
him
to
end
his
career
in
the
service
of
humanity
i
hope
he
will
act
like
a
man
on
the
scaffold
the
enemy
should
not
gloat
over
his
fear
his
craven
terror
they
see
in
him
the
spirit
of
the
people
of
course
he
is
not
worthy
of
it
but
he
must
die
like
a
bravely
defiantly
i
must
speak
to
him
about
it
the
deep
bass
of
the
gong
dispels
my
reverie
vii
there
is
a
distinct
sense
of
freedom
in
the
solitude
of
the
night
the
day
atmosphere
is
surcharged
with
noisome
anxiety
the
hours
laden
with
impending
terrors
but
the
night
is
soothing
for
the
first
time
i
feel
alone
unobserved
the
has
been
called
off
how
refinedly
brutal
is
this
constant
care
lest
the
hangman
be
robbed
of
his
prey
a
simple
precaution
against
suicide
the
warden
told
me
i
felt
the
naïve
stupidity
of
the
suggestion
like
the
thrust
of
a
dagger
what
a
tremendous
chasm
in
our
mental
attitudes
his
mind
can
not
grasp
the
impossibility
of
suicide
before
i
have
explained
to
the
people
the
motive
and
purpose
of
my
act
suicide
as
if
the
mere
death
of
frick
was
my
object
the
very
thought
is
impossible
insulting
it
outrages
me
that
even
a
should
so
meanly
misjudge
the
aspirations
of
an
active
revolutionist
the
insignificant
reptile
frick
as
if
the
mere
man
were
worth
a
terroristic
effort
i
aimed
at
the
hydra
whose
visible
representative
was
frick
the
homestead
developments
had
given
him
temporary
prominence
thrown
this
particular
into
bold
relief
so
to
speak
that
alone
made
him
worthy
of
the
revolutionist
attention
primarily
as
an
object
lesson
it
would
strike
terror
into
the
soul
of
his
class
they
are
their
conscience
weighted
with
guilt
and
life
is
dear
to
them
their
strangling
hold
on
labor
might
be
loosened
only
for
a
while
no
doubt
but
that
much
would
be
gained
due
to
the
act
of
the
the
people
could
not
fail
to
realize
the
depth
of
a
love
that
will
give
its
own
life
for
their
cause
to
give
a
young
life
full
of
health
and
vitality
to
give
all
without
a
thought
of
self
to
give
all
voluntarily
cheerfully
nay
enthusiastically
could
any
one
fail
to
understand
such
a
love
but
this
is
the
first
terrorist
act
in
america
the
people
may
fail
to
comprehend
it
thoroughly
yet
they
will
know
that
an
anarchist
committed
the
deed
i
will
talk
to
them
from
the
courtroom
and
my
comrades
at
liberty
will
use
the
opportunity
to
the
utmost
to
shed
light
on
the
questions
involved
such
a
deed
must
draw
the
attention
of
the
world
this
first
act
of
voluntary
anarchist
sacrifice
will
make
the
workingmen
think
deeply
perhaps
even
more
so
than
the
chicago
martyrdom
the
latter
was
preëminently
a
lesson
in
capitalist
justice
the
culmination
of
a
plutocratic
conspiracy
the
tragedy
of
lacked
the
element
of
voluntary
anarchist
in
the
interests
of
the
people
in
that
distinctive
quality
my
act
is
initial
perhaps
it
will
prove
the
entering
wedge
the
leaven
of
growing
oppression
is
at
work
it
is
for
us
the
anarchists
to
educate
labor
to
its
great
mission
let
the
world
learn
of
the
misery
of
homestead
the
sudden
thunderclap
gives
warning
that
beyond
the
calm
horizon
the
storm
is
gathering
the
lightning
of
social
protest
quick
ahlick
plant
it
something
white
flutters
between
the
bars
hastily
i
read
the
newspaper
clipping
glorious
who
would
have
expected
it
a
soldier
in
one
of
the
regiments
stationed
at
homestead
called
upon
the
line
to
give
three
cheers
for
the
man
who
shot
frick
my
soul
overflows
with
beautiful
hopes
such
a
wonderful
spirit
among
the
militia
perhaps
the
soldiers
will
fraternize
with
the
strikers
it
is
by
no
means
an
impossibility
such
things
have
happened
before
after
all
they
are
of
the
people
mostly
workingmen
their
interests
are
identical
with
those
of
the
strikers
and
surely
they
hate
frick
who
is
universally
condemned
for
his
brutality
his
arrogance
this
soldier
what
is
his
name
iams
iams
he
typifies
the
best
feeling
of
the
regiment
the
others
probably
lack
his
courage
they
feared
to
respond
to
his
cheers
especially
because
of
the
presence
but
undoubtedly
most
of
them
feel
as
iams
does
it
would
be
dangerous
for
the
enemy
to
rely
upon
the
tenth
pennsylvania
and
in
the
other
homestead
regiments
there
must
also
be
such
noble
iamses
they
will
not
permit
their
comrade
to
be
as
the
colonel
threatens
iams
is
not
merely
a
militia
man
he
is
a
citizen
a
native
he
has
the
right
to
express
his
opinion
regarding
my
deed
if
he
had
condemned
it
he
would
not
be
punished
may
he
not
then
voice
a
favorable
sentiment
no
they
ca
punish
him
and
he
is
surely
very
popular
among
the
soldiers
how
manfully
he
behaved
as
the
colonel
raged
before
the
regiment
and
demanded
to
know
who
cheered
for
the
assassin
of
frick
as
the
imbecile
put
it
iams
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
boldly
avowed
his
act
he
could
have
remained
silent
or
denied
it
but
he
is
evidently
not
like
that
cowardly
he
even
refused
the
colonel
offer
to
apologize
brave
boy
he
is
the
right
material
for
a
revolutionist
such
a
man
has
no
business
to
belong
to
the
militia
he
should
know
for
what
purpose
it
is
intended
a
tool
of
capitalism
in
the
enslavement
of
labor
after
all
it
will
benefit
him
to
be
it
will
enlighten
him
i
must
follow
the
case
perhaps
the
negro
will
give
me
more
clippings
it
was
very
generous
of
him
to
risk
this
act
of
friendship
the
warden
has
expressly
interdicted
the
passing
of
newspapers
to
me
though
the
other
prisoners
are
permitted
to
buy
them
he
discriminates
against
me
in
every
possible
way
a
rank
ignoramus
he
can
not
even
pronounce
anarchist
yesterday
he
said
to
me
the
anachrists
are
no
good
what
do
they
want
anyhow
i
replied
angrily
first
you
say
they
are
no
good
then
you
ask
what
they
want
he
flushed
got
no
use
for
them
anyway
such
an
imbecile
not
the
least
sense
of
justice
he
condemns
without
knowing
i
believe
he
is
aiding
the
detectives
why
does
he
insist
i
should
plead
guilty
i
have
repeatedly
told
him
that
though
i
do
not
deny
the
act
i
am
innocent
the
stupid
laughed
outright
better
plead
guilty
you
get
off
easier
you
did
it
so
better
plead
guilty
in
vain
i
strove
to
explain
to
him
i
do
believe
in
your
laws
i
do
acknowledge
the
authority
of
your
courts
i
am
innocent
morally
the
aggravating
smile
of
condescending
wisdom
kept
playing
about
his
lips
plead
guilty
take
my
advice
plead
guilty
instinctively
i
sense
some
presence
at
the
door
the
small
cunning
eyes
of
the
warden
peer
intently
through
the
bars
i
feel
him
an
enemy
well
he
may
have
the
clipping
now
if
he
wishes
but
no
torture
shall
draw
from
me
an
admission
incriminating
the
negro
the
name
rakhmetov
flits
through
my
mind
i
shall
be
true
to
that
memory
a
gentleman
in
my
office
wishes
to
see
you
the
warden
informs
me
who
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
from
pittsburgh
i
know
no
one
in
pittsburgh
i
do
care
to
see
the
man
the
warden
suave
insistence
arouses
my
suspicions
why
should
he
be
so
much
interested
in
my
seeing
a
stranger
visits
are
privileges
i
have
been
told
i
decline
the
privilege
but
the
warden
insists
i
refuse
finally
he
orders
me
out
of
the
cell
two
guards
lead
me
into
the
hallway
they
halt
me
at
the
head
of
a
line
of
a
dozen
men
six
are
counted
off
and
i
am
assigned
to
the
seventh
place
i
notice
that
i
am
the
only
one
in
the
line
wearing
glasses
the
warden
enters
from
an
inner
office
accompanied
by
three
visitors
they
pass
down
the
row
scrutinizing
each
face
they
return
their
gaze
fixed
on
the
men
one
of
the
strangers
makes
a
motion
as
if
to
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
man
on
my
left
the
warden
hastily
calls
the
visitors
aside
they
converse
in
whispers
then
walk
up
the
line
and
pass
slowly
back
till
they
are
alongside
of
me
the
tall
stranger
puts
his
hand
familiarly
on
my
shoulder
exclaiming
do
you
recognize
me
berkman
i
met
you
on
fifth
avenue
right
in
front
of
the
telegraph
building
the
building
in
which
the
offices
of
the
carnegie
company
were
located
i
never
saw
you
before
in
my
life
oh
yes
you
remember
i
spoke
to
you
no
you
did
not
i
interrupt
impatiently
take
him
back
the
warden
commands
i
protest
against
the
perfidious
proceeding
a
positive
identification
the
warden
asserts
the
detective
had
seen
me
in
the
company
of
two
friends
inspecting
the
office
of
mr
frick
indignantly
i
deny
the
false
statement
charging
him
with
abetting
the
conspiracy
to
involve
my
comrades
he
grows
livid
with
rage
and
orders
me
deprived
of
exercise
that
afternoon
the
warden
rôle
in
the
police
plot
is
now
apparent
to
me
i
realize
him
in
his
true
colors
ignorant
though
he
is
familiarity
with
police
methods
has
developed
in
him
a
certain
shrewdness
the
low
cunning
of
the
fox
seeking
its
prey
the
smile
masks
a
depth
of
malice
his
crude
vanity
glorying
in
the
successful
abuse
of
his
wardenship
over
unfortunate
human
beings
this
new
appreciation
of
his
character
clarifies
various
incidents
heretofore
puzzling
to
me
my
mail
is
being
detained
at
the
office
i
am
sure
it
is
impossible
that
my
new
york
comrades
should
have
neglected
me
so
long
it
is
now
over
a
week
since
my
arrest
as
a
matter
of
due
precaution
they
would
not
communicate
with
me
at
once
but
two
or
three
days
would
be
sufficient
to
perfect
a
yet
not
a
line
has
reached
me
from
them
it
is
evident
that
my
mail
is
being
detained
a
disguise
address
to
mask
the
identity
of
the
correspondent
my
reflections
rouse
bitter
hatred
of
the
warden
his
infamy
fills
me
with
rage
the
negro
warning
against
the
occupant
of
the
next
cell
assumes
a
new
aspect
undoubtedly
the
man
is
a
spy
placed
there
by
the
warden
evidently
little
incidents
insignificant
in
themselves
add
strong
proof
to
justify
the
suspicion
it
grows
to
conviction
as
i
review
various
circumstances
concerning
my
neighbor
the
questions
i
deemed
foolish
prompted
by
mere
curiosity
i
now
see
in
the
light
of
the
warden
rôle
as
volunteer
detective
the
young
negro
was
sent
to
the
dungeon
for
warning
me
against
the
spy
in
the
next
cell
but
the
latter
is
never
reported
notwithstanding
his
continual
knocking
and
talking
specially
privileged
evidently
and
the
warden
too
is
with
the
police
i
am
convinced
he
himself
caused
the
writing
of
those
letters
he
gave
me
yesterday
they
were
postmarked
homestead
from
a
pretended
striker
they
want
to
blow
up
the
mills
the
letter
said
good
bombs
are
needed
i
should
send
them
the
addresses
of
my
friends
who
know
how
to
make
effective
explosives
what
a
stupid
trap
one
of
the
epistles
sought
to
involve
some
of
the
strike
leaders
in
my
act
in
another
john
most
was
mentioned
well
i
am
not
to
be
caught
with
such
chaff
but
i
must
be
on
my
guard
it
is
best
i
should
decline
to
accept
mail
they
withhold
the
letters
of
my
friends
anyhow
yes
i
refuse
all
mail
i
feel
myself
surrounded
by
enemies
open
and
secret
not
a
single
being
here
i
may
call
friend
except
the
negro
who
i
know
wishes
me
well
i
hope
he
will
give
me
more
clippings
perhaps
there
will
be
news
of
my
comrades
i
try
to
fall
in
with
him
at
exercise
oh
they
are
handing
out
tracts
is
sunday
no
exercise
viii
the
lord
day
is
honored
by
depriving
the
prisoners
of
dinner
a
scanty
allowance
of
bread
with
a
tincupful
of
black
unsweetened
coffee
constitutes
breakfast
supper
is
a
repetition
of
the
morning
meal
except
that
the
coffee
looks
thinner
the
tincup
more
rusty
i
force
myself
to
swallow
a
mouthful
by
shutting
my
eyes
it
tastes
like
greasy
dishwater
with
a
bitter
suggestion
of
burnt
bread
exercise
is
also
abolished
on
the
sacred
day
the
atmosphere
is
pervaded
with
the
gloom
of
unbroken
silence
in
the
afternoon
i
hear
the
creaking
of
the
inner
gate
there
is
much
swishing
of
dresses
the
good
ladies
of
the
tracts
are
being
seated
the
doors
on
murderers
row
are
opened
partly
at
a
angle
the
prisoners
remain
in
their
cells
with
the
guards
stationed
at
the
gallery
entrances
all
is
silent
i
can
hear
the
beating
of
my
heart
in
the
oppressive
quiet
a
faint
shadow
crosses
the
darksome
floor
now
it
oscillates
on
the
bars
i
hear
the
muffled
fall
of
steps
silently
the
turnkey
passes
the
cell
like
a
flitting
mystery
casting
its
shadow
athwart
a
troubled
soul
i
catch
the
glint
of
a
revolver
protruding
from
his
pocket
suddenly
the
sweet
strains
of
a
violin
resound
in
the
corridor
female
voices
swell
the
melody
nearer
my
god
to
thee
nearer
to
thee
slowly
the
volume
expands
it
rises
grows
more
resonant
in
contact
with
the
gallery
floor
and
echoes
in
my
cell
nearer
to
thee
to
thee
the
sounds
die
away
a
deep
male
voice
utters
let
us
pray
its
metallic
hardness
rings
like
a
command
the
guards
stand
with
lowered
heads
their
lips
mumble
after
the
invisible
speaker
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
that
trespass
against
us
like
hell
you
do
some
one
shouts
from
the
upper
gallery
there
is
suppressed
giggling
in
the
cells
pellmell
the
officers
rush
up
the
stairs
the
uproar
increases
order
yells
and
catcalls
drown
the
warden
voice
doors
are
violently
opened
and
shut
the
thunder
of
rattling
iron
is
deafening
suddenly
all
is
quiet
the
guards
have
reached
the
galleries
only
hasty
tiptoeing
is
heard
the
offender
can
not
be
found
the
gong
rings
the
supper
hour
the
prisoners

no

the

ix
in
agitation
i
pace
the
cell
frick
did
die
he
has
almost
recovered
i
have
positive
information
the
blind
prisoner
gave
me
the
clipping
during
exercise
you
a
poor
shot
he
teased
me
the
poignancy
of
the
disappointment
pierces
my
heart
i
feel
it
with
the
intensity
of
a
catastrophe
my
imprisonment
the
vexations
of
jail
life
the
future
all
is
submerged
in
the
flood
of
misery
at
the
realization
of
my
failure
bitter
thoughts
crowd
my
mind
overwhelms
me
i
failed
failed
it
might
have
been
different
had
i
gone
to
frick
residence
it
was
my
original
intention
too
but
the
house
in
the
east
end
was
guarded
besides
i
had
no
time
to
wait
that
very
morning
the
papers
had
announced
frick
intended
visit
to
new
york
i
was
determined
he
should
not
escape
me
i
resolved
to
act
at
once
it
was
mainly
his
cowardice
that
saved
him
he
hid
under
the
chair
played
dead
and
now
he
lives
the
vampire
and
homestead
how
will
it
affect
conditions
there
if
frick
had
died
carnegie
would
have
hastened
to
settle
with
the
strikers
the
shrewd
scot
only
made
use
of
frick
to
destroy
the
hated
union
he
himself
was
absent
he
could
not
be
held
accountable
the
author
of
triumphant
democracy
is
sensitive
to
adverse
criticism
with
the
elimination
of
frick
responsibility
for
homestead
conditions
would
rest
with
carnegie
to
support
his
rôle
as
the
friend
of
labor
he
must
needs
terminate
the
sanguinary
struggle
such
a
development
of
affairs
would
have
greatly
advanced
the
anarchist
propaganda
however
some
may
condemn
my
act
the
workers
could
not
be
blind
to
the
actual
situation
and
the
practical
effects
of
death
but
his
recovery
yet
who
can
tell
it
may
perhaps
have
the
same
results
if
not
the
strike
was
virtually
lost
when
the
permitted
the
militia
to
take
possession
of
homestead
it
afforded
the
company
an
opportunity
to
fill
the
mills
with
scabs
but
even
if
the
strike
be
lost
our
propaganda
is
the
chief
consideration
the
homestead
workers
are
but
a
very
small
part
of
the
american
working
class
important
as
this
great
struggle
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
people
is
supreme
and
their
true
cause
is
anarchism
all
other
issues
are
merged
in
it
it
alone
will
solve
the
labor
problem
no
other
consideration
deserves
attention
the
suffering
of
individuals
of
large
masses
indeed
is
unavoidable
under
capitalist
conditions
poverty
and
wretchedness
must
constantly
increase
it
is
inevitable
a
revolutionist
can
not
be
influenced
by
mere
sentimentality
we
bleed
for
the
people
we
suffer
for
them
but
we
know
the
real
source
of
their
misery
our
whole
civilization
false
to
the
core
as
it
is
must
be
destroyed
to
be
born
anew
only
with
the
abolition
of
exploitation
will
labor
gain
justice
anarchism
alone
can
save
the
world
these
reflections
somewhat
soothe
me
my
failure
to
accomplish
the
desired
result
is
grievously
exasperating
and
i
feel
deeply
humiliated
but
i
shall
be
the
sole
sufferer
properly
viewed
the
merely
physical
result
of
my
act
can
not
affect
its
propagandistic
value
and
that
is
always
the
supreme
consideration
the
chief
purpose
of
my
was
to
call
attention
to
our
social
iniquities
to
arouse
a
vital
interest
in
the
sufferings
of
the
people
by
an
act
of
to
stimulate
discussion
regarding
the
cause
and
purpose
of
the
act
and
thus
bring
the
teachings
of
anarchism
before
the
world
the
homestead
situation
offered
the
psychologic
social
moment
what
matter
the
personal
consequences
to
frick
the
merely
physical
results
of
my
the
conditions
necessary
for
propaganda
are
there
the
act
is
accomplished
as
to
myself
my
disappointment
is
bitter
indeed
i
wanted
to
die
for
the
cause
but
now
they
will
send
me
to
prison
they
will
bury
me
alive
involuntarily
my
hand
reaches
for
the
lapel
of
my
coat
when
suddenly
i
remember
my
great
loss
in
agony
i
live
through
again
the
scene
in
the
police
station
on
the
third
day
after
my
arrest
rough
hands
seize
my
arms
and
i
am
forced
into
a
chair
my
head
is
thrust
violently
backward
and
i
face
the
chief
he
clutches
me
by
the
throat
open
your
mouth
damn
you
open
your
mouth
everything
is
whirling
before
me
the
desk
is
circling
the
room
the
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
chief
gaze
at
me
from
the
floor
his
feet
flung
high
in
the
air
and
everything
is
whirling
whirling
now
doc
quick
there
is
a
sharp
sting
in
my
tongue
my
jaws
are
gripped
as
by
a
vise
and
my
mouth
is
torn
open
what
d
think
of
eh
the
chief
stands
before
me
in
his
hand
the
dynamite
cartridge
what
this
he
demands
with
an
oath
candy
i
reply
defiantly
x
how
full
of
anxiety
these
two
weeks
have
been
still
no
news
of
my
comrades
the
warden
is
not
offering
me
any
more
mail
he
evidently
regards
my
last
refusal
as
final
but
i
am
now
permitted
to
purchase
papers
they
may
contain
something
about
my
friends
if
i
could
only
learn
what
propaganda
is
being
made
out
of
my
act
and
what
the
girl
and
fedya
are
doing
i
long
to
know
what
is
happening
with
them
but
my
interest
is
merely
that
of
the
revolutionist
they
are
so
far
away
i
do
not
count
among
the
living
on
the
outside
everything
seems
to
continue
as
usual
as
if
nothing
had
happened
frick
is
quite
well
now
at
his
desk
again
the
press
reports
nothing
else
of
importance
the
police
seem
to
have
given
up
their
hunt
how
ridiculous
the
chief
has
made
himself
by
kidnaping
my
friend
mollock
the
new
york
baker
the
impudence
of
the
authorities
to
decoy
an
unsuspecting
workingman
across
the
state
line
and
then
arrest
him
as
my
accomplice
i
suppose
he
is
the
only
anarchist
the
stupid
chief
could
find
my
negro
friend
informed
me
of
the
kidnaping
last
week
but
i
felt
no
anxiety
i
knew
the
silent
baker
would
prove
deaf
and
dumb
not
a
word
could
they
draw
from
him
mollock
discharge
by
the
magistrate
put
the
chief
in
a
very
ludicrous
position
now
he
is
thirsting
for
revenge
and
probably
seeking
a
victim
nearer
home
in
allegheny
but
if
the
comrades
preserve
silence
all
will
be
well
for
i
was
careful
to
leave
no
clew
i
had
told
them
that
my
destination
was
chicago
where
i
expected
to
secure
a
position
i
can
depend
on
bauer
and
nold
but
that
man
whom
i
found
living
in
the
same
house
with
nold
impressed
me
as
rather
unreliable
i
thought
there
was
something
of
the
look
about
him
i
should
certainly
not
trust
him
and
i
afraid
he
might
compromise
the
others
why
are
they
friendly
i
wonder
he
is
probably
not
even
a
comrade
the
allegheny
anarchists
should
have
nothing
in
common
with
him
it
is
not
well
for
us
to
associate
with
the
my
meditation
is
interrupted
by
a
guard
who
informs
me
that
i
am
wanted
at
the
office
there
is
a
letter
for
me
but
some
postage
is
due
on
it
would
i
pay
a
trap
it
flits
through
my
mind
as
i
accompany
the
overseer
i
shall
persist
in
my
refusal
to
accept
decoy
mail
more
letters
from
homestead
i
turn
to
the
warden
he
quickly
suppresses
a
smile
no
it
is
postmarked
brooklyn
n
y
i
glance
at
the
envelope
the
writing
is
apparently
a
woman
but
the
chirography
is
smaller
than
the
girl
i
yearn
for
news
of
her
the
letter
is
from
brooklyn
perhaps
a
i
take
the
letter
warden
all
right
you
will
open
it
here
then
i
do
want
it
i
start
from
the
office
when
the
warden
detains
me
take
the
letter
along
but
within
ten
minutes
you
must
return
it
to
me
you
may
go
now
i
hasten
to
the
cell
if
there
is
anything
important
in
the
letter
i
shall
destroy
it
i
owe
the
enemy
no
obligations
as
with
trembling
hand
i
tear
open
the
envelope
a
paper
dollar
flutters
to
the
floor
i
glance
at
the
signature
but
the
name
is
unfamiliar
anxiously
i
scan
the
lines
an
unknown
sympathizer
sends
greetings
in
the
name
of
humanity
i
am
not
an
anarchist
i
read
but
i
wish
you
well
my
sympathy
however
is
with
the
man
not
with
the
act
i
can
not
justify
your
attempt
life
human
life
especially
is
sacred
none
has
the
right
to
take
what
he
can
not
give
i
pass
a
troubled
night
my
mind
struggles
with
the
problem
presented
so
unexpectedly
can
any
one
understanding
my
motives
doubt
the
justification
of
the
the
legal
aspect
aside
can
the
morality
of
the
act
be
questioned
it
is
impossible
to
confound
law
with
right
they
are
opposites
the
law
is
immoral
it
is
the
conspiracy
of
rulers
and
priests
against
the
workers
to
continue
their
subjection
to
be
means
to
acquiesce
if
not
directly
participate
in
that
conspiracy
a
revolutionist
is
the
truly
moral
man
to
him
the
interests
of
humanity
are
supreme
to
advance
them
his
sole
aim
in
life
government
with
its
laws
is
the
common
enemy
all
weapons
are
justifiable
in
the
noble
struggle
of
the
people
against
this
terrible
curse
the
law
it
is
the
of
the
centuries
the
path
of
man
is
soaked
with
the
blood
it
has
shed
can
this
great
criminal
determine
right
is
a
revolutionist
to
respect
such
a
travesty
it
would
mean
the
perpetuation
of
human
slavery
no
the
revolutionist
owes
no
duty
to
capitalist
morality
he
is
the
soldier
of
humanity
he
has
consecrated
his
life
to
the
people
in
their
great
struggle
it
is
a
bitter
war
the
revolutionist
can
not
shrink
from
the
service
it
imposes
upon
him
aye
even
the
duty
of
death
cheerfully
and
joyfully
he
would
die
a
thousand
times
to
hasten
the
triumph
of
liberty
his
life
belongs
to
the
people
he
has
no
right
to
live
or
enjoy
while
others
suffer
how
often
we
had
discussed
this
fedya
and
i
he
was
somewhat
inclined
to
sybaritism
not
quite
emancipated
from
the
tendencies
of
his
youth
once
in
new
york
i
shall
never
forget
at
the
time
when
our
circle
had
just
begun
the
publication
of
the
first
jewish
anarchist
paper
in
america
we
came
to
blows
we
the
most
intimate
friends
yes
actually
came
to
blows
nobody
would
have
believed
it
they
used
to
call
us
the
twins
if
i
happened
to
appear
anywhere
alone
they
would
inquire
anxiously
what
is
the
matter
is
your
chum
sick
it
was
so
unusual
we
were
each
other
shadow
but
one
day
i
struck
him
he
had
outraged
my
most
sacred
feelings
to
spend
twenty
cents
for
a
meal
it
was
not
mere
extravagance
it
was
positively
a
crime
incredible
in
a
revolutionist
i
could
not
forgive
him
for
months
even
now
two
years
have
passed
yet
a
certain
feeling
of
resentment
still
remains
with
me
what
right
had
a
revolutionist
to
such
the
movement
needed
aid
every
cent
was
valuable
to
spend
twenty
cents
for
a
single
meal
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
cause
true
it
was
his
first
meal
in
two
days
and
we
were
economizing
on
rent
by
sleeping
in
the
parks
he
had
worked
hard
too
to
earn
the
money
but
he
should
have
known
that
he
had
no
right
to
his
earnings
while
the
movement
stood
in
such
need
of
funds
his
defence
was
unspeakably
aggravating
he
had
earned
ten
dollars
that
week
he
had
given
seven
into
the
treasury
he
needed
three
dollars
for
his
week
expenses
his
shoes
were
torn
too
i
had
no
patience
with
such
arguments
they
merely
proved
his
predilections
personal
comforts
could
not
be
of
any
consideration
to
a
true
revolutionist
it
was
a
question
of
the
movement
needs
the
first
issue
every
penny
spent
for
ourselves
was
so
much
taken
from
the
cause
true
the
revolutionist
must
live
but
luxury
is
a
crime
worse
a
weakness
one
could
exist
on
five
cents
a
day
twenty
cents
for
a
single
meal
incredible
it
was
robbery
poor
twin
he
was
deeply
grieved
but
he
knew
that
i
was
merely
just
the
revolutionist
has
no
personal
right
to
anything
everything
he
has
or
earns
belongs
to
the
cause
everything
even
his
affections
indeed
these
especially
he
must
not
become
too
much
attached
to
anything
he
should
guard
against
strong
love
or
passion
the
people
should
be
his
only
great
love
his
supreme
passion
mere
human
sentiment
is
unworthy
of
the
real
revolutionist
he
lives
for
humanity
and
he
must
ever
be
ready
to
respond
to
its
call
the
soldier
of
revolution
must
not
be
lured
from
the
field
of
battle
by
the
siren
song
of
love
great
danger
lurks
in
such
weakness
the
russian
tyrant
has
frequently
attempted
to
bait
his
prey
with
a
beautiful
woman
our
comrades
there
are
careful
not
to
associate
with
any
woman
except
of
proved
revolutionary
character
aye
her
mere
passive
interest
in
the
cause
is
not
sufficient
love
may
transform
her
into
a
delilah
to
shear
one
strength
only
with
a
woman
consecrated
to
active
participation
may
the
revolutionist
associate
their
perfect
comradeship
would
prove
a
mutual
inspiration
a
source
of
increased
strength
equals
thoroughly
solidaric
they
would
the
more
successfully
serve
the
cause
of
the
people
countless
russian
women
bear
witness
sophia
perovskaya
vera
figner
zassulitch
and
many
other
heroic
martyrs
tortured
in
the
casemates
of
schlüsselburg
buried
alive
in
the
petropavlovka
what
devotion
what
fortitude
perfect
comrades
they
were
often
stronger
than
the
men
brave
noble
women
that
fill
the
prisons
and
tramp
the
toilsome
road
the
siberian
steppe
rises
before
me
its
broad
expanse
shimmers
in
the
sun
rays
and
blinds
the
eye
with
white
brilliancy
the
endless
monotony
agonizes
the
sight
and
stupefies
the
brain
it
breathes
the
chill
of
death
into
the
heart
and
grips
the
soul
with
the
terror
of
madness
in
vain
the
eye
seeks
relief
from
the
white
monster
that
slowly
tightens
his
embrace
and
threatens
to
swallow
you
in
his
frozen
depth
there
in
the
distance
where
the
blue
meets
the
white
a
heavy
line
of
crimson
dyes
the
surface
it
winds
along
the
virgin
bosom
grows
redder
and
deeper
and
ascends
the
mountain
in
a
dark
ribbon
twining
and
wreathing
its
course
in
lengthening
pain
now
disappearing
in
the
hollow
and
again
rising
on
the
height
behold
a
man
and
a
woman
hand
in
hand
their
heads
bent
on
their
shoulders
a
heavy
cross
slowly
toiling
the
upward
way
and
behind
them
others
men
and
women
young
and
old
all
weary
with
the
heavy
task
trudging
along
the
dismal
desert
amid
death
and
silence
save
for
the
mournful
clank
clank
of
the
chains
get
out
now
exercise
as
in
a
dream
i
walk
along
the
gallery
the
voice
of
my
exercise
mate
sounds
dully
in
my
ears
i
do
not
understand
what
he
is
saying
does
he
know
about
the
nihilists
i
wonder
billy
have
you
ever
read
anything
about
nihilists
sure
berk
when
i
done
my
last
bit
in
the
dump
below
a
guy
lent
me
a
book
a
corker
too
it
was
let
see
what
you
call
again
nihilists
yes
sure
about
some
nihirists
the
book
called
aivan
strodjoff
what
was
the
name
somethin
like
that
aivan
strodjoff
or
strogoff
oh
you
mean
ivan
strogov
do
you
that
it
funny
names
them
foreigners
have
a
fellow
needs
a
jaw
to
say
it
every
day
but
the
story
was
a
corker
all
right
about
a
rooshan
patriot
or
something
he
was
hot
stuff
i
tell
you
overheard
a
plot
to
kill
th
king
by
them
fellows
er
what
you
call
nihilists
yep
nihilist
plot
you
know
well
they
wants
to
kill
his
nibs
and
all
the
dookes
to
make
one
of
their
own
crowd
king
see
foxy
fellows
you
bet
but
aivan
was
too
much
for
he
plays
detective
gets
in
all
kinds
of
scrapes
and
some
one
burns
his
eyes
out
but
he
game
i
do
remember
how
it
all
ends
but
i
know
the
story
it
trash
it
does
tell
the
truth
about
oh
with
it
say
berk
d
think
they
hang
me
wo
the
judge
sympathize
with
a
blind
man
look
at
me
eyes
pretty
near
blind
swear
to
god
i
am
wo
hang
a
blind
man
will
they
the
pitiful
appeal
goes
to
my
heart
and
i
assure
him
they
will
not
hang
a
blind
man
his
eyes
brighten
his
face
grows
radiant
with
hope
why
does
he
love
life
so
i
wonder
of
what
value
is
it
without
a
high
purpose
uninspired
by
revolutionary
ideals
he
is
small
and
cowardly
he
lies
to
save
his
neck
there
is
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
his
eyes
but
why
should
lie
for
his
sake
my
conscience
smites
me
for
the
moment
of
weakness
i
should
not
allow
inane
sentimentality
to
influence
me
it
is
beneath
the
revolutionist
billy
i
say
with
some
asperity
many
innocent
people
have
been
hanged
the
nihilists
for
instance
oh
damn
what
do
care
about
will
they
hang
what
i
want
to
know
may
be
they
will
i
reply
irritated
at
the
profanation
of
my
ideal
a
look
of
terror
spreads
over
his
face
his
eyes
are
fastened
upon
me
his
lips
parted
yes
i
continue
perhaps
they
will
hang
you
many
innocent
men
have
suffered
such
a
fate
i
do
think
you
are
innocent
either
nor
blind
you
do
need
those
glasses
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
your
eyes
now
understand
billy
i
do
want
them
to
hang
you
i
do
believe
in
hanging
but
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
and
you
better
be
ready
for
the
worst
gradually
the
look
of
fear
fades
from
his
face
rage
suffuses
his
cheeks
with
spots
of
dark
red
you
crazy
what
the
use
talkin
to
you
anyhow
you
are
a
damn
anarchist
i
a
good
catholic
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
always
did
right
but
the
good
father
confessed
me
last
week
i
no
damn
murderer
like
you
see
it
was
an
accident
i
pretty
near
blind
and
this
is
a
christian
country
thank
god
they
wo
hang
a
blind
man
do
you
ever
talk
to
again
xi
the
days
and
weeks
pass
in
wearying
monotony
broken
only
by
my
anxiety
about
the
approaching
trial
it
is
part
of
the
designed
cruelty
to
keep
me
ignorant
of
the
precise
date
hold
yourself
ready
you
may
be
called
any
time
the
warden
had
said
but
the
shadows
are
lengthening
the
days
come
and
go
and
still
my
name
has
not
appeared
on
the
court
calendar
why
this
torture
let
me
have
over
with
it
my
mission
is
almost
accomplished
the
explanation
in
court
and
then
my
life
is
done
i
shall
never
again
have
an
opportunity
to
work
for
the
cause
i
may
therefore
leave
the
world
i
should
die
content
but
for
the
partial
failure
of
my
plans
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
is
gnawing
at
my
heart
yet
why
the
physical
results
of
my
act
can
not
affect
its
propagandistic
value
why
then
these
regrets
i
should
rise
above
them
but
the
gibes
of
officers
and
prisoners
wound
me
bad
shot
you
they
do
not
dream
how
keen
their
thoughtless
thrusts
i
smile
and
try
to
appear
indifferent
while
my
heart
bleeds
why
should
i
the
revolutionist
be
moved
by
such
remarks
it
is
weakness
they
are
so
far
beneath
me
they
live
in
the
swamp
of
their
narrow
personal
interests
they
can
not
understand
and
yet
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
may
reach
the
eagle
aerie
and
disturb
the
peace
of
the
heights
the
trusty
passes
along
the
gallery
he
walks
slowly
dusting
the
iron
railing
then
turns
to
give
my
door
a
few
light
strokes
with
the
leaning
against
the
outer
wall
he
stoops
low
pretending
to
wipe
the
doorsill
there
is
a
quick
movement
of
his
hand
and
a
little
roll
of
white
is
shot
between
the
lower
bars
falling
at
my
feet
a
stiff
he
whispers
indifferently
i
pick
up
the
note
i
know
no
one
in
the
jail
it
is
probably
some
poor
fellow
asking
for
cigarettes
placing
the
roll
between
the
pages
of
a
newspaper
i
am
surprised
to
find
it
in
german
from
whom
can
it
be
i
turn
to
the
signature
carl
nold
impossible
it
a
trap
no
but
that
handwriting
i
could
not
mistake
it
the
small
clear
chirography
is
undoubtedly
nold
but
how
did
he
smuggle
in
this
note
i
feel
the
blood
rush
to
my
head
as
my
eye
flits
over
the
penciled
lines
bauer
and
he
are
arrested
they
are
in
the
jail
now
charged
with
conspiracy
to
kill
frick
detectives
swore
they
met
them
in
my
company
in
front
of
the
frick
office
building
they
have
engaged
a
lawyer
the
note
runs
on
would
i
accept
his
services
i
probably
have
no
money
and
i
should
expect
any
from
new
york
because
most
what
this
because
most
has
repudiated
the
act
the
gong
tolls
the
exercise
hour
with
difficulty
i
walk
to
the
gallery
i
feel
feverish
my
feet
drag
heavily
and
i
stumble
against
the
railing
is
yo
sick
ahlick
it
must
be
the
negro
voice
my
throat
is
dry
my
lips
refuse
to
move
hazily
i
see
the
guard
approach
he
walks
me
to
the
cell
and
lowers
the
berth
you
may
lie
down
the
lock
clicks
and
alone
the
line
marches
past
up
and
down
up
and
down
the
regular
footfall
beats
against
my
brain
like
hammer
strokes
when
will
they
stop
my
head
aches
dreadfully
i
am
glad
i
do
have
to
walk
it
was
good
of
the
negro
to
call
the
guard
i
felt
so
sick
what
was
it
oh
the
note
where
is
it
the
possibility
of
loss
dismays
me
hastily
i
pick
the
newspaper
up
from
the
floor
with
trembling
hands
i
turn
the
leaves
ah
it
here
if
i
had
not
found
it
i
vaguely
wonder
were
the
thing
mere
fancy
the
sight
of
the
crumpled
paper
fills
me
with
dread
nold
and
bauer
here
perhaps
if
they
act
discreetly
all
will
be
well
they
are
innocent
they
can
prove
it
but
most
how
can
it
be
possible
of
course
he
was
displeased
when
i
began
to
associate
with
the
autonomists
but
how
can
that
make
any
difference
at
such
a
time
what
matter
personal
likes
and
dislikes
to
a
revolutionist
to
a
most
the
hero
of
my
first
years
in
america
the
name
that
stirred
my
soul
in
that
little
library
in
kovno
most
the
bridge
of
liberty
my
teacher
the
author
of
the
the
ideal
revolutionist
he
to
denounce
me
to
repudiate
propaganda
by
deed
it
incredible
i
can
not
believe
it
the
girl
will
not
fail
to
write
to
me
about
it
i
wait
till
i
hear
from
her
but
then
nold
is
himself
a
great
admirer
of
most
he
would
not
say
anything
derogatory
unless
fully
convinced
that
it
is
true
yet
it
is
barely
conceivable
how
explain
such
a
change
in
most
to
forswear
his
whole
past
his
glorious
past
he
was
always
so
proud
of
it
and
of
his
extreme
revolutionism
some
tremendous
motive
must
be
back
of
such
apostasy
it
has
no
parallel
in
anarchist
annals
but
what
can
it
be
how
boldly
he
acted
during
the
haymarket
tragedy
publicly
advised
the
use
of
violence
to
avenge
the
capitalist
conspiracy
he
must
have
realized
the
danger
of
the
speech
for
which
he
was
later
doomed
to
blackwell
island
i
remember
his
defiant
manner
on
the
way
to
prison
how
i
admired
his
strong
spirit
as
i
accompanied
him
on
the
last
ride
that
was
only
a
little
over
a
year
ago
and
he
is
just
out
a
few
months
perhaps
is
it
possible
a
coward
has
that
prison
experience
influenced
his
present
attitude
why
it
is
terrible
to
think
of
most
a
coward
he
who
has
devoted
his
entire
life
to
the
cause
sacrificed
his
seat
in
the
reichstag
because
of
uncompromising
honesty
stood
in
the
forefront
all
his
life
faced
peril
and
danger
a
coward
yet
it
is
impossible
that
he
should
have
suddenly
altered
the
views
of
a
lifetime
what
could
have
prompted
his
denunciation
of
my
act
personal
dislike
no
that
was
a
matter
of
petty
jealousy
his
confidence
in
me
as
a
revolutionist
was
unbounded
did
he
not
issue
a
secret
circular
letter
to
aid
my
plans
concerning
russia
that
was
proof
of
absolute
faith
one
could
not
change
his
opinion
so
suddenly
moreover
it
can
have
no
bearing
on
his
repudiation
of
a
terrorist
act
i
can
find
no
explanation
unless
can
it
be
fear
of
personal
consequences
afraid
might
be
held
responsible
perhaps
such
a
possibility
is
not
excluded
surely
the
enemy
hates
him
bitterly
and
would
welcome
an
opportunity
would
even
conspire
to
hang
him
but
that
is
the
price
one
pays
for
his
love
of
humanity
every
revolutionist
is
exposed
to
this
danger
most
especially
his
whole
career
has
been
a
duel
with
tyranny
but
he
was
never
before
influenced
by
such
considerations
is
he
not
prepared
to
take
the
responsibility
for
his
terrorist
propaganda
the
work
of
his
whole
life
why
has
he
suddenly
been
stricken
with
fear
can
it
be
can
it
be
my
soul
is
in
the
throes
of
agonizing
doubt
despair
grips
my
heart
as
i
hesitatingly
admit
to
myself
the
probable
truth
but
it
can
not
be
nold
has
made
a
mistake
may
be
the
letter
is
a
trap
it
was
not
written
by
carl
but
i
know
his
hand
so
well
it
is
his
his
perhaps
i
have
a
letter
in
the
morning
the
girl
she
is
the
only
one
i
can
trust
she
tell
me
my
head
feels
heavy
wearily
i
lie
on
the
bed
perhaps
a
letter
xii
your
pards
are
here
do
you
want
to
see
them
the
warden
asks
what
your
partners
bauer
and
nold
my
comrades
you
mean
i
have
no
partners
same
thing
want
to
see
them
their
lawyers
are
here
yes
i
see
them
of
course
i
myself
need
no
defence
i
will
conduct
my
own
case
and
explain
my
act
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
meet
my
comrades
i
wonder
how
they
feel
about
their
arrest
perhaps
they
are
inclined
to
blame
me
and
what
is
their
attitude
toward
my
deed
if
they
side
with
most
my
senses
are
on
the
alert
as
the
guard
accompanies
me
into
the
hall
near
the
wall
seated
at
a
small
table
i
behold
nold
and
bauer
two
other
men
are
with
them
their
attorneys
i
suppose
all
eyes
scrutinize
me
curiously
searchingly
nold
advances
toward
me
his
manner
is
somewhat
nervous
a
look
of
intense
seriousness
in
his
eyes
he
grasps
my
hand
the
pressure
is
warm
intimate
as
if
he
yearns
to
pour
boundless
confidence
into
my
heart
for
a
moment
a
wave
of
thankfulness
overwhelms
me
i
long
to
embrace
him
but
curious
eyes
bore
into
me
i
glance
at
bauer
there
is
a
cheerful
smile
on
the
ruddy
face
the
guard
pushes
a
chair
toward
the
table
and
leans
against
the
railing
his
presence
constrains
me
he
will
report
to
the
warden
everything
said
i
am
introduced
to
the
lawyers
the
contrast
in
their
appearance
suggests
a
lifetime
of
legal
wrangling
the
younger
man
evidently
a
recent
graduate
is
quick
alert
and
talkative
there
is
an
air
of
anxious
expectancy
about
him
with
a
look
of
semitic
shrewdness
in
the
long
narrow
face
he
enlarges
upon
the
kind
consent
of
his
distinguished
colleague
to
take
charge
of
my
case
his
demeanor
toward
the
elder
lawyer
is
deeply
respectful
almost
reverential
the
latter
looks
bored
and
is
silent
do
you
wish
to
say
something
colonel
the
young
lawyer
suggests
nothing
he
ejects
the
monosyllable
sharply
brusquely
his
colleague
looks
abashed
like
a
schoolboy
caught
in
a
naughty
act
you
mr
berkman
he
asks
i
thank
them
for
their
interest
in
my
case
but
i
need
no
defence
i
explain
since
i
do
not
consider
myself
guilty
i
am
exclusively
concerned
in
making
a
public
statement
in
the
courtroom
if
i
am
represented
by
an
attorney
i
should
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
yet
it
is
most
vital
to
clarify
to
the
people
the
purpose
of
my
act
the
circumstances
the
heavy
breathing
opposite
distracts
me
i
glance
at
the
colonel
his
eyes
are
closed
and
from
the
parted
lips
there
issues
the
regular
respiration
of
sound
sleep
a
look
of
mild
dismay
crosses
the
young
lawyer
face
he
rises
with
an
apologetic
smile
you
are
tired
colonel
it
awfully
close
here
let
us
go
the
colonel
replies
depressed
i
return
to
the
cell
the
old
lawyer
how
little
my
explanation
interested
him
he
fell
asleep
why
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
an
issue
that
involves
the
welfare
of
the
world
i
was
so
happy
at
the
opportunity
to
elucidate
my
motives
to
intelligent
americans
and
he
was
sleeping
the
young
lawyer
too
is
disgusting
with
his
air
of
condescending
pity
toward
one
who
will
have
a
fool
for
a
client
as
he
characterized
my
decision
to
conduct
my
own
case
he
may
think
such
a
course
suicidal
perhaps
it
is
in
regard
to
consequences
but
the
length
of
the
sentence
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
i
die
soon
anyway
the
only
thing
of
importance
now
is
my
explanation
and
that
man
fell
asleep
perhaps
he
considers
me
a
criminal
but
what
can
i
expect
of
a
lawyer
when
even
the
could
not
understand
my
act
most
himself
with
the
name
i
recollect
the
letters
the
guard
had
given
me
during
the
interview
there
are
three
of
them
one
from
the
girl
at
last
why
did
she
not
write
before
they
must
have
kept
the
letter
in
the
office
yes
the
postmark
is
a
week
old
she
tell
me
about
most
but
what
is
the
use
i
sure
of
it
now
i
read
it
plainly
in
nold
eyes
it
all
true
but
i
must
see
what
she
writes
how
every
line
breathes
her
devotion
to
the
cause
she
is
the
real
russian
woman
revolutionist
her
letter
is
full
of
bitterness
against
the
attitude
of
most
and
his
lieutenants
in
the
german
and
jewish
anarchist
circles
but
she
writes
words
of
cheer
and
encouragement
in
my
imprisonment
she
refers
to
the
financial
difficulties
of
the
little
commune
consisting
of
fedya
herself
and
one
or
two
other
comrades
and
closes
with
the
remark
that
fortunately
i
need
no
money
for
legal
defence
or
attorneys
the
staunch
girl
she
and
fedya
are
after
all
the
only
true
revolutionists
i
know
in
our
ranks
the
others
all
possess
some
weakness
i
could
not
rely
on
them
the
german
comrades
they
are
heavy
phlegmatic
they
lack
the
enthusiasm
of
russia
i
wonder
how
they
ever
produced
a
reinsdorf
well
he
is
the
exception
there
is
nothing
to
be
expected
from
the
german
movement
excepting
perhaps
the
autonomists
but
they
are
a
mere
handful
quite
insignificant
kept
alive
mainly
by
the
most
and
peukert
feud
peukert
too
the
life
of
their
circle
is
chiefly
concerned
with
his
personal
rehabilitation
quite
natural
of
course
a
terrible
injustice
has
been
done
him
it
is
remarkable
that
the
false
accusations
have
not
driven
him
into
obscurity
there
is
great
perseverance
aye
moral
courage
of
no
mean
order
in
his
survival
in
the
movement
it
was
that
which
first
awakened
my
interest
in
him
most
explanation
full
of
bitter
invective
suggested
hostile
personal
feeling
what
a
tremendous
sensation
i
created
at
the
first
jewish
anarchist
conference
by
demanding
that
the
charges
against
peukert
be
investigated
the
result
entirely
failed
to
substantiate
the
accusations
but
the
mostianer
were
not
convinced
blinded
by
the
vituperative
eloquence
of
most
and
now
now
again
they
will
follow
as
blindly
to
be
sure
they
will
not
dare
take
open
stand
against
my
act
not
the
jewish
comrades
at
least
after
all
the
fire
of
russia
still
smolders
in
their
hearts
but
most
attitude
toward
me
will
influence
them
it
will
dampen
their
enthusiasm
and
thus
react
on
the
propaganda
the
burden
of
making
agitation
through
my
act
will
fall
on
the
girl
shoulders
she
will
stand
a
lone
soldier
in
the
field
she
will
exert
her
utmost
efforts
i
am
convinced
but
she
will
stand
alone
fedya
will
also
remain
loyal
but
what
can
he
do
he
is
not
a
speaker
nor
the
rest
of
the
commune
circle
and
most
we
had
all
been
so
intimate
it
his
cursed
jealousy
and
cowardice
too
yes
mostly
cowardice
he
ca
be
jealous
of
me
now
he
recently
left
prison
it
must
have
terrorized
him
the
weakling
he
will
minimize
the
effect
of
my
act
perhaps
paralyze
its
propagandistic
influence
altogether
now
i
stand
alone
except
for
the
girl
quite
alone
it
is
always
so
was
not
he
alone
my
beloved
unknown
grinevitzky
isolated
scorned
by
his
comrades
but
his
bomb
how
it
thundered
joseph
peukert
at
one
time
a
leading
anarchist
of
austria
was
charged
with
betraying
the
german
anarchist
neve
into
the
hands
of
the
police
neve
was
sentenced
to
ten
prison
peukert
always
insisted
that
the
accusation
against
him
originated
with
some
of
his
political
enemies
among
the
socialists
it
is
certain
that
the
arrest
of
neve
was
not
due
to
calculated
treachery
on
the
part
of
peukert
but
rather
to
indiscretion
i
was
just
a
boy
then
let
me
see
it
was
in
i
was
about
eleven
years
old
the
class
was
assembling
after
the
noon
recess
i
had
barely
settled
in
my
seat
when
the
teacher
called
me
forward
his
long
pointer
was
dancing
a
fanciful
figure
on
the
gigantic
map
of
russia
what
province
is
that
he
demanded
astrakhan
mention
its
chief
products
products
the
name
chernishevsky
flitted
through
my
mind
he
was
in
astrakhan
i
heard
maxim
tell
mother
so
at
dinner
nihilists
i
burst
out
the
boys
tittered
some
laughed
aloud
the
teacher
grew
purple
he
struck
the
pointer
violently
on
the
floor
shivering
the
tapering
end
suddenly
there
broke
a
roll
of
thunder
one
two
with
a
terrific
crash
the
window
panes
fell
upon
the
desks
the
floor
shook
beneath
our
feet
the
room
was
hushed
deathly
pale
the
teacher
took
a
step
toward
the
window
but
hastily
turned
and
dashed
from
the
room
the
pupils
rushed
after
him
i
wondered
at
the
air
of
fear
and
suspicion
on
the
streets
at
home
every
one
spoke
in
subdued
tunes
father
looked
at
mother
severely
reproachfully
and
maxim
was
unusually
silent
but
his
face
seemed
radiant
an
unwonted
brilliancy
in
his
eye
at
night
alone
with
me
in
the
dormitory
he
rushed
to
my
bed
knelt
at
my
side
and
threw
his
arms
around
me
and
kissed
me
and
cried
and
kissed
me
his
wildness
frightened
me
what
is
it
maximotchka
i
breathed
softly
he
ran
up
and
down
the
room
kissing
me
and
murmuring
glorious
glorious
victory
between
sobs
solemnly
pledging
me
to
secrecy
he
whispered
mysterious
words
will
of
the
people
tyrant
removed
free
russia
xiii
the
nights
overwhelm
me
with
the
sense
of
solitude
life
is
so
remote
so
appallingly
far
away
it
has
abandoned
me
in
this
desert
of
silence
the
distant
puffing
of
fire
engines
the
shrieking
of
river
sirens
accentuate
my
loneliness
yet
it
feels
so
near
this
monster
life
huge
palpitating
with
vitality
intent
upon
its
wonted
course
how
unmindful
of
myself
flung
into
the
darkness
like
a
furnace
spark
belched
forth
amid
fire
and
smoke
into
the
blackness
of
night
the
monster
its
eyes
are
implacable
they
watch
every
gate
of
life
every
approach
they
guard
lest
i
enter
back
i
and
the
others
here
poor
unfortunates
how
irritated
and
nervous
they
are
growing
as
their
trial
day
draws
near
there
is
a
hunted
look
in
their
eyes
their
faces
are
haggard
and
anxious
they
walk
weakly
haltingly
worn
with
the
long
days
of
waiting
only
blackie
the
young
negro
remains
cheerful
but
i
often
miss
the
broad
smile
on
the
kindly
face
i
am
sure
his
eyes
were
moist
when
the
three
italians
returned
from
court
this
morning
they
had
been
sentenced
to
death
joe
a
boy
of
eighteen
walked
to
the
cell
with
a
firm
step
his
brother
pasquale
passed
us
with
both
hands
over
his
face
weeping
silently
but
the
old
man
their
father
as
he
was
crossing
the
hallway
we
saw
him
suddenly
stop
for
a
moment
he
swayed
then
lurched
forward
his
head
striking
the
iron
railing
his
body
falling
limp
to
the
floor
by
the
arms
the
guards
dragged
him
up
the
stairway
his
legs
hitting
the
stone
with
a
dull
thud
the
fresh
crimson
spreading
over
his
white
hair
a
glassy
torpor
in
his
eyes
suddenly
he
stood
upright
his
head
thrown
back
his
arms
upraised
he
cried
hoarsely
anguished
o
santa
maria
sio
innocente
inno
the
guard
swung
his
club
the
old
man
reeled
and
fell
ready
shouted
the
warden
mocked
the
echo
under
the
roof
the
old
man
haunts
my
days
i
hear
the
agonized
cry
its
black
despair
chills
my
marrow
exercise
hour
has
become
insupportable
the
prisoners
irritate
me
each
is
absorbed
in
his
own
case
the
deadening
monotony
of
the
jail
routine
grows
unbearable
the
constant
cruelty
and
brutality
is
harrowing
i
wish
it
were
all
over
the
uncertainty
of
my
trial
day
is
a
ceaseless
torture
i
have
been
waiting
now
almost
two
months
my
court
speech
is
prepared
i
could
die
now
but
they
would
suppress
my
explanation
and
the
people
thus
remain
ignorant
of
my
aim
and
purpose
i
owe
it
to
the
cause
and
to
the
true
comrades
to
stay
on
the
scene
till
after
the
trial
there
is
nothing
more
to
bind
me
to
life
with
the
speech
my
opportunities
for
propaganda
will
be
exhausted
death
suicide
is
the
only
logical
the
sole
possible
conclusion
yes
that
is
if
i
only
knew
the
date
of
my
trial
that
day
will
be
my
last
the
poor
old
italian
he
and
his
sons
they
at
least
know
when
they
are
to
die
they
count
each
day
every
hour
brings
them
closer
to
the
end
they
will
be
hanged
here
in
the
jail
yard
perhaps
they
killed
under
great
provocation
in
the
heat
of
passion
but
the
sheriff
will
murder
them
in
cold
blood
the
law
of
peace
and
order
i
shall
not
be
hanged
yet
i
feel
as
if
i
were
dead
my
life
is
done
only
the
last
rite
remains
to
be
performed
after
that
well
i
find
a
way
when
the
trial
is
over
they
return
me
to
my
cell
the
spoon
is
of
tin
i
shall
put
a
sharp
edge
on
it
on
the
stone
floor
very
quietly
at
night
number
six
to
court
six
did
the
turnkey
call
six
who
is
in
cell
six
why
it
cell
i
feel
the
cold
perspiration
running
down
my
back
my
heart
beats
violently
my
hands
tremble
as
i
hastily
pick
up
the
newspaper
nervously
i
turn
the
pages
there
must
be
some
mistake
my
name
appear
yet
in
the
court
calendar
column
the
list
is
published
every
monday
why
this
is
saturday
paper
yesterday
we
had
service
it
must
be
monday
oh
shame
they
did
give
me
the
paper
and
it
monday
yes
it
monday
the
shadow
falls
across
my
door
the
lock
clicks
hurry
to
court
chapter
vii
the
trial
the
courtroom
breathes
the
chill
of
the
graveyard
the
stained
windows
cast
sickly
rays
into
the
silent
chamber
in
the
sombre
light
the
faces
look
funereal
spectral
anxiously
i
scan
the
room
perhaps
my
friends
the
girl
have
come
to
greet
me
everywhere
cold
eyes
meet
my
gaze
police
and
court
attendants
on
every
side
several
newspaper
men
draw
near
it
is
humiliating
that
through
them
i
must
speak
to
the
people
prisoner
at
the
bar
stand
up
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
the
clerk
vociferates
charges
me
with
felonious
assault
on
frick
with
intent
to
kill
felonious
assault
on
john
leishman
feloniously
entering
the
offices
of
the
carnegie
company
on
three
occasions
each
constituting
a
separate
indictment
and
with
unlawfully
carrying
concealed
weapons
do
you
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
i
protest
against
the
multiplication
of
the
charges
i
do
not
deny
the
attempt
on
frick
but
the
accusation
of
having
assaulted
leishman
is
not
true
i
have
visited
the
carnegie
offices
only
do
you
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
the
judge
interrupts
not
guilty
i
want
to
explain
your
attorneys
will
do
that
i
have
no
attorney
the
court
will
appoint
one
to
defend
you
i
need
no
defence
i
want
to
make
a
statement
you
will
be
given
an
opportunity
at
the
proper
time
impatiently
i
watch
the
proceedings
of
what
use
are
all
these
preliminaries
my
conviction
is
a
foregone
conclusion
the
men
in
the
jury
box
there
they
are
to
decide
my
fate
as
if
they
could
understand
they
measure
me
with
cold
unsympathetic
looks
why
were
the
talesmen
not
examined
in
my
presence
they
were
already
seated
when
i
entered
when
was
the
jury
picked
i
demand
you
have
four
challenges
the
prosecutor
retorts
the
names
of
the
talesmen
sound
strange
but
what
matter
who
are
the
men
to
judge
me
they
too
belong
to
the
enemy
they
will
do
the
bidding
yet
i
may
even
for
a
moment
clog
the
wheels
of
the
juggernaut
at
random
i
select
four
names
from
the
printed
list
and
the
new
jurors
file
into
the
box
the
trial
proceeds
a
police
officer
and
two
negro
employees
of
frick
in
turn
take
the
witness
stand
they
had
seen
me
three
times
in
the
frick
office
they
testify
they
speak
falsely
but
i
feel
indifferent
to
the
hired
witnesses
a
tall
man
takes
the
stand
i
recognize
the
detective
who
so
brazenly
claimed
to
identify
me
in
the
jail
he
is
followed
by
a
physician
who
states
that
each
wound
of
frick
might
have
proved
fatal
john
leishman
is
called
i
attempted
to
kill
him
he
testifies
it
a
lie
i
cry
out
angrily
but
the
guards
force
me
into
the
seat
now
frick
comes
forward
he
seeks
to
avoid
my
eye
as
i
confront
him
the
prosecutor
turns
to
me
i
decline
to
examine
the
witnesses
for
the
state
they
have
spoken
falsely
there
is
no
truth
in
them
and
i
shall
not
participate
in
the
mockery
call
the
witnesses
for
the
defence
the
judge
commands
i
have
no
need
of
witnesses
i
wish
to
proceed
with
my
statement
the
prosecutor
demands
that
i
speak
english
but
i
insist
on
reading
my
prepared
paper
in
german
the
judge
rules
to
permit
me
the
services
of
the
court
interpreter
i
address
myself
to
the
people
i
begin
some
may
wonder
why
i
have
declined
a
legal
defence
my
reasons
are
twofold
in
the
first
place
i
am
an
anarchist
i
do
not
believe
in
law
designed
to
enslave
and
oppress
humanity
secondly
an
extraordinary
phenomenon
like
an
can
not
be
measured
by
the
narrow
standards
of
legality
it
requires
a
view
of
the
social
background
to
be
adequately
understood
a
lawyer
would
try
to
defend
or
palliate
my
act
from
the
standpoint
of
the
law
yet
the
real
question
at
issue
is
not
a
defence
of
myself
but
rather
the
of
the
deed
it
is
mistaken
to
believe
on
trial
the
actual
defendant
is
society
the
system
of
injustice
of
the
organized
exploitation
of
the
people
the
voice
of
the
interpreter
sounds
cracked
and
shrill
word
for
word
he
translates
my
utterance
the
sentences
broken
disconnected
in
his
inadequate
english
the
vociferous
tones
pierce
my
ears
and
my
heart
bleeds
at
his
meaningless
declamation
translate
sentences
not
single
words
i
remonstrate
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
leaves
me
oh
please
go
on
i
cry
in
dismay
he
returns
hesitatingly
look
at
my
paper
i
adjure
him
and
translate
each
sentence
as
i
read
it
the
glazy
eyes
are
turned
to
me
in
a
blank
unseeing
stare
the
man
is
blind
let
us
continue
he
stammers
we
have
heard
enough
the
judge
interrupts
i
have
not
read
a
third
of
my
paper
i
cry
in
consternation
it
will
do
i
have
declined
the
services
of
attorneys
to
get
time
to
we
allow
you
five
more
minutes
but
i
ca
explain
in
such
a
short
time
i
have
the
right
to
be
heard
we
teach
you
differently
i
am
ordered
from
the
witness
chair
several
jurymen
leave
their
seats
but
the
district
attorney
hurries
forward
and
whispers
to
them
they
remain
in
the
jury
box
the
room
is
hushed
as
the
judge
rises
have
you
anything
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
passed
upon
you
you
would
not
let
me
speak
i
reply
your
justice
is
a
farce
silence
in
a
daze
i
hear
the
droning
voice
on
the
bench
hurriedly
the
guards
lead
me
from
the
courtroom
the
judge

the

i

i

so

i
long
to

now
the

the
steps

all
is
silent
and
i
am
alone
a
nameless
weight
oppresses
me
i
feel
exhausted
my

a
void
heavily
i
fall
on
the

head
buried

and
consumes
my

now
it
pierces
my

my

is
aflame
it
is
swept
by
a
raging
fire
oh
i
wake
in
horror
a
stream
of
dazzling

is
pouring
into

terrified
i
press
my

to
my
eyes
but
the
mysterious
flow
pierces
my
lids
and
blinds
me
with
maddening
torture
get
up
and
undress
what
the
matter
with
you
anyhow
the
voice
frightens
me
the
cell
is
filled
with
a
continuous
glare
beyond
all
is
dark
the
guard
invisible
now
lay
down
and
go
to
sleep
silently
i
obey
when
suddenly
all
grows
black
before
my

a
terrible
fear
grips
my
heart
have
i
gone
blind
i
grope
for
the
bed
the
wall
i
ca
see
with
a
desperate
cry
i
spring
to
the
door
a
faint
click
reaches
my
tense
ear
the
streaming
lightning
burns
into
my
face
oh
i
can
see
i
can
see
what
t
hell
the
matter
with
you
eh
go
to
sleep
you
hear
quiet
and
immovable
i
lie
on
the
bed
strange
horrors
haunt
me
what
a
terrible
place
this
must
be
this
agony
i
can
not
support
it
years
oh
it
is
hopeless
hopeless
i
must
die
i
die
with
bated
breath
i
creep
from
the
bed
the
iron
bedstead
creaks
in
affright
i
draw
back
feigning
sleep
all
remains
silent
the
guard
did
not
hear
me
i
should
feel
the
terrible
even
with
closed
lids
slowly
i
open
my
eyes
it
is
dark
all
around
i
grope
about
the
cell
the
wall
is
damp
musty
the
odors
are
nauseating
i
can
not
live
here
i
must
die
this
very
night
something
white
glimmers
in
the
corner
cautiously
i
bend
over
it
is
a
spoon
for
a
moment
i
hold
it
indifferently
then
a
great
joy
overwhelms
me
now
i
can
die
i
creep
back
into
bed
nervously
clutching
the
tin
my
hand
feels
for
my
heart
it
is
beating
violently
i
will
put
the
narrow
end
of
the
spoon
over
here
like
this
i
will
force
it
in
a
little
lower
a
steady
pressure
just
between
the
ribs
the
metal
feels
cold
how
hot
my
body
is
caressingly
i
pat
the
spoon
against
my
side
my
fingers
seek
the
edge
it
is
dull
i
must
press
it
hard
yes
it
is
very
dull
if
i
only
had
my
revolver
but
the
cartridge
might
fail
to
explode
why
frick
is
now
well
and
i
must
die
how
he
looked
at
me
in
court
there
was
hate
in
his
eyes
and
fear
too
he
turned
his
head
away
he
could
not
face
me
i
saw
that
he
felt
guilty
yet
he
lives
i
crush
him
oh
i
failed
i
failed
keep
quiet
there
or
i
put
you
in
the
hole
the
gruff
voice
startles
me
i
must
have
been
moaning
i
draw
the
blanket
over
my
head
so
what
was
i
thinking
about
oh
i
remember
he
is
well
and
i
am
here
i
failed
to
crush
him
he
lives
of
course
it
does
not
really
matter
the
opportunity
for
propaganda
is
there
as
the
result
of
my
act
that
was
the
main
purpose
but
i
meant
to
kill
him
and
he
lives
my
speech
too
failed
they
tricked
me
they
kept
the
date
secret
they
were
afraid
my
friends
would
be
present
it
was
maddening
the
way
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
judge
kept
interrupting
me
i
did
not
read
even
a
third
of
my
statement
and
the
whole
effect
was
lost
how
that
man
interpreted
the
poor
old
man
he
was
deeply
offended
when
i
corrected
his
translation
i
did
not
know
he
was
blind
i
called
him
back
and
suffered
renewed
torture
at
his
screeching
i
was
almost
glad
when
the
judge
forced
me
to
discontinue
that
judge
he
acted
as
indifferently
as
if
the
matter
did
not
concern
him
he
must
have
known
that
the
sentence
meant
death
years
as
if
it
is
possible
to
survive
such
a
sentence
in
this
terrible
place
yes
he
knew
it
he
spoke
of
making
an
example
of
me
the
old
villain
he
has
been
doing
it
all
his
life
making
an
example
of
social
victims
the
victims
of
his
own
class
of
capitalism
the
brutal
mockery
of
it
had
i
anything
to
say
why
sentence
should
not
be
passed
yet
he
would
permit
me
to
continue
my
statement
the
court
has
been
very
patient
i
am
glad
i
told
him
that
i
did
expect
justice
and
did
not
get
it
perhaps
i
should
have
thrown
in
his
face
the
epithet
that
sprang
to
my
lips
no
it
was
best
that
i
controlled
my
anger
else
they
would
have
rejoiced
to
proclaim
the
anarchists
vulgar
criminals
such
things
help
to
prejudice
the
people
against
us
we
criminals
we
who
are
ever
ready
to
give
our
lives
for
liberty
criminals
and
they
our
accusers
they
break
their
own
laws
they
knew
it
was
not
legal
to
multiply
the
charges
against
me
they
made
six
indictments
out
of
one
act
as
if
the
minor
offences
were
not
included
in
the
major
made
necessary
by
the
deed
itself
they
thirsted
for
blood
legally
they
could
not
give
me
more
than
seven
years
but
i
am
an
anarchist
i
had
attempted
the
life
of
a
great
magnate
in
him
capitalism
felt
itself
attacked
of
course
i
knew
they
would
take
advantage
of
my
refusal
to
be
legally
represented
years
the
judge
imposed
the
maximum
penalty
on
each
charge
well
i
expected
no
less
and
it
makes
no
difference
now
i
am
going
to
die
anyway
i
clutch
the
spoon
in
my
feverish
hand
its
narrow
end
against
my
heart
i
test
the
resistance
of
the
flesh
a
violent
blow
will
drive
it
between
the
ribs
one
two
three
the
deep
metallic
bass
floats
upon
the
silence
resonant
compelling
instantly
all
is
motion
overhead
on
the
sides
everything
is
vibrant
with
life
men
yawn
and
cough
chairs
and
beds
are
noisily
moved
about
heavy
feet
pace
stone
floors
in
the
distance
sounds
a
low
rolling
as
of
thunder
it
grows
nearer
and
louder
i
hear
the
officers
sharp
command
the
familiar
click
of
locks
doors
opening
and
shutting
now
the
rumbling
grows
clearer
more
distinct
with
a
moan
the
heavy
stops
at
my
cell
a
guard
unlocks
the
door
his
eyes
rest
on
me
curiously
suspiciously
while
the
trusty
hands
me
a
small
loaf
of
bread
i
have
barely
time
to
withdraw
my
arm
before
the
door
is
closed
and
locked
want
coffee
hold
your
cup
between
the
narrow
bars
the
beverage
is
poured
into
my
bent
rusty
tin
can
in
the
of
the
cell
the
steaming
liquid
overflows
scalding
my
bare
feet
with
a
cry
of
pain
i
drop
the
can
in
the
hall
the
floor
looks
stained
with
blood
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
guard
shouts
at
me
i
could
help
it
want
to
be
smart
do
you
well
we
take
it
out
of
you
hey
there
sam
the
officer
motions
to
the
trusty
no
dinner
for
a
you
hear
yes
sir
yes
sir
no
more
coffee
either
yes
sir
the
guard
measures
me
with
a
look
of
scornful
hatred
malice
mirrors
in
his
face
involuntarily
i
step
back
into
the
cell
his
gaze
falls
on
my
naked
feet
ai
you
got
no
shoes
yes
ca
you
say
got
shoes
yes
put
on
damn
you
his
tongue
sweeps
the
large
quid
of
tobacco
from
one
cheek
to
the
either
with
a
hiss
a
thick
stream
of
brown
splashes
on
my
feet
damn
you
put
on
the
clatter
and
noises
have
ceased
the
steps
have
died
away
all
is
still
in
the
dark
hall
only
occasional
shadows
flit
by
silent
ghostlike
ii
forward
march
the
lung
line
of
prisoners
in
stripes
and
lockstep
resembles
an
undulating
snake
wriggling
from
side
to
side
its
body
moving
forward
yet
apparently
remaining
in
the
same
spot
a
thousand
feet
strike
the
stone
floor
in
regular
tempo
with
alternate
rising
and
falling
accent
as
each
division
flanked
by
officers
approaches
and
passes
my
cell
brutal
faces
repulsive
in
their
stolid
indifference
or
malicious
leer
here
and
there
a
head
intelligent
eye
or
sympathetic
expression
but
accentuates
the
features
of
the
striped
line
coarse
and
sinister
with
the
look
of
the
ruthlessly
hunted
head
bent
right
arm
extended
with
hand
touching
the
shoulder
of
the
man
in
front
all
uniformly
clad
in
horizontal
black
and
gray
the
men
seem
cogs
in
a
machine
oscillating
to
the
shouted
command
of
the
tall
guards
on
the
flanks
stern
and
alert
the
measured
beat
grows
fainter
and
dies
with
the
hollow
thud
of
the
last
footfall
behind
the
closed
double
door
leading
into
the
prison
yard
the
pall
of
silence
descends
upon
the
i
feel
utterly
alone
deserted
and
forsaken
amid
the
towering
pile
of
stone
and
iron
the
stillness
overwhelms
me
with
almost
tangible
weight
i
am
buried
within
the
narrow
walls
the
massive
rock
is
pressing
down
upon
my
head
my
sides
i
can
not
breathe
the
foul
air
is
stifling
oh
i
ca
i
ca
live
here
i
ca
suffer
this
agony
years
it
is
a
lifetime
no
it
impossible
i
must
die
i
will
now
clutching
the
spoon
i
throw
myself
on
the
bed
my
eyes
wander
over
the
cell
faintly
lit
by
the
light
in
the
hall
the
whitewashed
walls
yellow
with
damp
the
splashes
of
blood
at
the
head
of
the
bed
the
clumps
of
vermin
around
the
holes
in
the
wall
the
small
table
and
the
rickety
chair
the
filthy
floor
black
and
gray
in
spots
why
it
stone
i
can
sharpen
the
spoon
cautiously
i
crouch
in
the
corner
the
tin
glides
over
the
greasy
surface
noiselessly
smoothly
till
the
thick
layer
of
filth
is
worn
off
then
it
scratches
and
scrapes
with
the
pillow
i
deaden
the
rasping
sound
the
metal
is
growing
hot
in
my
hand
i
pass
the
sharp
edge
across
my
finger
drops
of
blood
trickle
down
to
the
floor
the
wound
is
ragged
but
the
blade
is
keen
stealthily
i
crawl
back
into
bed
my
hand
gropes
for
my
heart
i
touch
the
spot
with
the
blade
between
the
ribs
here
i
be
dead
when
they
find
me
if
frick
had
only
died
so
much
propaganda
could
be
made
that
damned
most
if
he
had
turned
against
me
he
will
ruin
the
whole
effect
of
the
act
it
nothing
but
cowardice
but
what
is
he
afraid
of
they
ca
implicate
him
we
been
estranged
for
over
a
year
he
could
easily
prove
it
the
traitor
preached
propaganda
by
deed
all
his
life
now
he
repudiates
the
first
in
this
country
what
tremendous
agitation
he
could
have
made
of
it
now
he
denies
me
he
does
know
me
the
wretch
he
knew
me
well
enough
and
trusted
me
too
when
together
we
set
up
the
secret
circular
in
the
office
it
was
in
william
street
we
waited
for
the
other
compositors
to
leave
then
we
worked
all
night
it
was
to
recommend
me
i
planned
to
go
to
russia
then
yes
to
russia
perhaps
i
might
have
done
something
important
there
why
did
i
go
what
was
it
well
i
ca
think
of
it
now
it
peculiar
though
but
america
was
more
important
plenty
of
revolutionists
in
russia
and
now
oh
i
never
do
anything
more
i
be
dead
soon
they
find
me
cold
a
pool
of
blood
under
me
the
mattress
will
be
red
no
it
will
be
and
the
blood
will
soak
through
the
straw
i
wonder
how
much
blood
i
have
it
will
gush
from
my
heart
i
must
strike
right
here
strong
and
quick
it
will
not
pain
much
but
the
edge
is
ragged
it
may
catch
or
tear
the
flesh
they
say
the
skin
is
tough
i
must
strike
hard
perhaps
better
to
fall
against
the
blade
no
the
tin
may
bend
i
grasp
it
close
like
this
then
a
quick
drive
right
into
the
heart
it
the
surest
way
i
must
not
wound
myself
i
would
bleed
slowly
they
might
discover
me
still
alive
no
no
i
must
die
at
once
they
find
me
dead
my
heart
they
feel
it
not
beating
the
blade
still
in
it
they
call
the
doctor
dead
and
the
girl
and
fedya
and
the
others
will
hear
of
it
she
be
sad
but
she
will
understand
yes
she
will
be
glad
they
torture
me
here
she
know
i
cheated
them
yes
she
where
is
she
now
what
does
she
think
of
it
all
does
she
too
think
i
failed
and
fedya
also
if
i
only
hear
from
her
just
once
it
would
be
easier
to
die
but
she
understand
she
git
off
that
bed
do
you
know
the
rules
eh
get
out
o
there
horrified
speechless
i
spring
to
my
feet
the
spoon
falls
from
my
relaxed
grip
it
strikes
the
floor
clinking
on
the
stone
loudly
damningly
my
heart
stands
still
as
i
face
the
guard
there
is
something
repulsively
familiar
about
the
tall
man
his
mouth
drawn
into
a
derisive
smile
oh
it
the
officer
of
the
morning
foxy
ai
you
gim
me
that
spoon
the
coffee
incident
flashes
through
my
mind
loathing
and
hatred
of
the
tall
guard
fill
my
being
for
a
second
i
hesitate
i
must
hide
the
spoon
i
can
not
afford
to
lose
it
not
to
this
brute
here
i
am
dragged
from
the
cell
the
tall
keeper
carefully
examines
the
spoon
a
malicious
grin
stealing
over
his
face
look
sharp
as
a
razor
pretty
eh
take
him
to
the
deputy
mr
fellings
iii
in
the
rotunda
connecting
the
north
and
south
the
deputy
stands
at
a
high
desk
angular
and
bony
with
slightly
stooped
shoulders
his
face
is
a
mass
of
minute
wrinkles
seamed
on
yellow
parchment
the
curved
nose
overhangs
thin
compressed
lips
the
steely
eyes
measure
me
coldly
unfriendly
who
is
this
the
low
almost
feminine
voice
sharply
accentuates
the
face
and
figure
the
contrast
is
startling
a
what
is
the
charge
officer
two
charges
mcpane
layin
in
bed
and
tryin
soocide
a
smile
of
satanic
satisfaction
slowly
spreads
over
the
deputy
wizened
face
the
long
heavy
fingers
of
his
right
hand
work
convulsively
as
if
drumming
stiffly
on
an
imaginary
board
yes
hm
hm
yes
a
two
charges
hm
hm
how
did
he
try
to
hm
hm
to
commit
suicide
with
this
spoon
mcpane
sharp
as
a
razor
yes
hm
yes
wants
to
die
we
have
no
such
charge
as
hm
hm
as
trying
suicide
in
this
institution
sharpened
spoon
hm
hm
a
grave
offence
i
see
about
that
later
for
breaking
the
rules
hm
hm
by
lying
in
bed
out
of
hours
hm
hm
three
days
take
him
down
officer
he
will
hm
hm
cool
off
i
am
faint
and
weary
a
sense
of
utter
indifference
possesses
me
vaguely
i
am
conscious
of
the
guards
leading
me
through
dark
corridors
dragging
me
down
steep
flights
half
undressing
me
and
finally
thrusting
me
into
a
black
void
i
am
dizzy
my
head
is
awhirl
i
stagger
and
fall
on
the
flagstones
of
the
dungeon
the
cell
is
filled
with
light
it
hurts
my
eyes
some
one
is
bending
over
me
a
bit
feverish
better
take
him
to
the
cell
hm
hm
doctor
he
is
in
punishment
not
safe
mr
mcpane
we
postpone
it
then
hm
hm
take
him
to
the
cell
officers
git
up
my
legs
seem
paralyzed
they
refuse
to
move
i
am
lifted
and
carried
up
the
stairs
through
corridors
and
halls
and
then
thrown
heavily
on
a
bed
i
feel
so
weak
perhaps
i
shall
die
now
it
would
be
best
but
i
have
no
weapon
they
have
taken
away
the
spoon
there
is
nothing
in
the
cell
that
i
could
use
these
iron
bars
i
could
beat
my
head
against
them
but
oh
it
is
such
a
horrible
death
my
skull
would
break
and
the
brains
ooze
out
but
the
bars
are
smooth
would
my
skull
break
with
one
blow
i
afraid
it
might
only
crack
and
i
should
be
too
weak
to
strike
again
if
i
only
had
a
revolver
that
is
the
easiest
and
quickest
i
always
thought
i
prefer
such
a
death
to
be
shot
the
barrel
close
to
the
temple
one
could
miss
some
people
have
done
it
in
front
of
a
mirror
but
i
have
no
mirror
i
have
no
revolver
either
through
the
mouth
it
is
also
fatal
that
moscow
student
russov
was
his
name
yes
ivan
russov
he
shot
himself
through
the
mouth
of
course
he
was
foolish
to
kill
himself
for
a
woman
but
i
admired
his
courage
how
coolly
he
had
made
all
preparations
he
even
left
a
note
directing
that
his
gold
watch
be
given
to
the
landlady
because
he
wrote
after
passing
through
his
brain
the
bullet
might
damage
the
wall
wonderful
it
actually
happened
that
way
i
saw
the
bullet
imbedded
in
the
wall
near
the
sofa
and
ivan
lay
so
still
and
peaceful
i
thought
he
was
asleep
i
had
often
seen
him
like
that
in
my
brother
study
after
our
lessons
what
a
splendid
tutor
he
was
i
liked
him
from
the
first
when
mother
introduced
him
sasha
ivan
nikolaievitch
will
be
your
instructor
in
latin
during
vacation
time
my
hand
hurt
all
day
he
had
gripped
it
so
powerfully
like
a
vise
but
i
was
glad
i
did
cry
out
i
admired
him
for
it
i
felt
he
must
be
very
strong
and
manly
to
have
such
a
handshake
mother
smiled
when
i
told
her
about
it
her
hand
pained
her
too
she
said
sister
blushed
a
little
rather
energetic
she
observed
and
maxim
felt
so
happy
over
the
favorable
impression
made
by
his
college
chum
what
did
i
tell
you
he
cried
in
glee
ivan
nikolaievitch
think
of
it
only
twenty
graduates
next
year
the
youngest
alumnus
since
the
foundation
of
the
university
but
how
red
were
maxim
eyes
when
he
brought
the
bullet
home
he
would
keep
it
he
said
as
long
as
he
lived
he
had
dug
it
out
with
his
own
hands
from
the
wall
of
ivan
nikolaievitch
room
at
dinner
he
opened
the
little
box
unwrapped
the
cotton
an
i
showed
me
the
bullet
sister
went
into
hysterics
and
mamma
called
max
a
brute
for
a
woman
an
unworthy
woman
sister
moaned
i
thought
he
was
foolish
to
take
his
life
on
account
of
a
woman
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
ivan
nikolaievitch
should
have
been
more
manly
they
all
said
she
was
very
beautiful
the
acknowledged
belle
of
kovno
she
was
tall
and
stately
but
i
thought
she
walked
too
stiffly
she
seemed
and
artificial
mother
said
i
was
too
young
to
talk
of
such
things
how
shocked
she
would
have
been
had
she
known
that
i
was
in
love
with
nadya
my
sister
chum
and
i
had
kissed
our
chambermaid
too
dear
little
rosa
i
remember
she
threatened
to
tell
mother
i
was
so
frightened
i
would
come
to
dinner
mamma
sent
the
maid
to
call
me
but
i
refused
to
go
till
rosa
promised
not
to
tell
the
sweet
girl
with
those
cheeks
how
kind
she
was
but
the
little
imp
could
keep
the
secret
she
told
tatanya
the
cook
of
our
neighbor
the
latin
instructor
at
the
gymnasium
next
day
he
teased
me
about
the
servant
girl
before
the
whole
class
too
i
wished
the
floor
would
open
and
swallow
me
i
was
so
mortified
clever
brave
lad
how
far
off
it
all
seems
centuries
away
i
wonder
what
has
become
of
her
where
is
rosa
now
why
she
must
be
here
in
america
i
had
almost
forgotten
i
met
her
in
new
york
it
was
such
a
surprise
i
was
standing
on
the
stoop
of
the
tenement
house
where
i
boarded
i
had
then
been
only
a
few
months
in
the
country
a
young
lady
passed
by
she
looked
up
at
me
then
turned
and
ascended
the
steps
do
you
know
me
berkman
do
you
really
recognize
me
some
mistake
i
thought
i
had
never
before
seen
this
beautiful
stylish
young
woman
she
invited
me
into
the
hallway
do
tell
these
people
here
i
am
rosa
do
you
remember
why
you
know
i
was
your
mother
your
mother
maid
she
blushed
violently
those
red
cheeks
why
certainly
it
rosa
i
thought
of
the
stolen
kiss
would
i
dare
it
now
i
wondered
suddenly
conscious
of
my
shabby
clothes
she
seemed
so
prosperous
how
our
positions
were
changed
she
looked
the
very
like
my
sister
is
your
mother
here
she
asked
mother
she
died
just
before
i
left
i
glanced
apprehensively
at
her
did
she
remember
that
terrible
scene
when
mother
struck
her
i
did
know
about
your
mother
her
voice
was
husky
a
tear
glistened
in
her
eye
the
dear
girl
always
i
ought
to
make
amends
to
her
for
mother
insult
we
looked
at
each
other
in
embarrassment
then
she
held
out
a
gloved
hand
very
large
i
thought
red
too
probably
berkman
she
said
i
see
you
again
soon
please
do
tell
these
people
who
i
am
i
experienced
a
feeling
of
guilt
and
shame
berkman
somehow
it
echoed
the
servile
with
which
the
domestics
used
to
address
my
mother
for
all
her
finery
rosa
had
not
gotten
over
it
too
much
bred
in
poor
girl
she
has
not
become
emancipated
i
never
saw
her
at
our
meetings
she
is
conservative
no
doubt
she
was
so
ignorant
she
could
not
even
read
perhaps
she
has
learned
in
this
country
now
she
will
read
about
me
and
she
know
how
i
died
oh
i
have
the
spoon
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
i
ca
live
i
could
stand
this
torture
perhaps
if
i
had
seven
years
i
would
try
to
serve
the
sentence
but
i
could
anyhow
i
might
live
here
a
year
or
two
but
years
what
is
the
use
no
man
could
survive
it
it
terrible
years
their
cursed
justice
they
always
talk
of
law
yet
legally
i
should
have
gotten
more
than
seven
years
legally
as
if
care
about
legality
they
wanted
to
make
an
example
of
me
of
course
i
knew
it
beforehand
but
if
i
had
seven
years
perhaps
i
might
live
through
it
i
would
try
but
it
a
lifetime
a
whole
lifetime
seventeen
is
no
better
that
man
jamestown
got
seventeen
years
he
celled
next
to
me
in
the
jail
he
did
look
like
a
highway
robber
he
was
so
small
and
puny
he
must
be
here
now
a
fool
to
think
he
could
live
here
seventeen
years
in
this
hell
what
an
imbecile
he
is
he
should
have
committed
suicide
long
ago
they
sent
him
away
before
my
trial
it
about
three
weeks
ago
enough
time
why
has
he
done
something
he
will
soon
die
here
anyway
it
would
be
better
to
suicide
a
strong
man
might
live
five
years
i
doubt
it
though
perhaps
a
very
strong
man
might
could
no
i
know
i
could
perhaps
two
or
three
years
at
most
we
had
often
spoken
about
this
the
girl
fedya
and
i
had
then
such
a
peculiar
idea
of
prison
i
thought
i
would
be
sitting
on
the
floor
in
a
gruesome
black
hole
with
my
hands
and
feet
chained
to
the
wall
and
the
worms
would
crawl
over
me
and
slowly
devour
my
face
and
my
eyes
and
i
so
helpless
chained
to
the
wall
the
girl
and
fedya
had
a
similar
idea
she
said
she
might
bear
prison
life
a
few
weeks
i
could
for
a
year
i
thought
but
was
doubtful
i
pictured
myself
fighting
the
worms
off
with
my
feet
it
would
take
the
vermin
that
long
to
eat
all
my
flesh
till
they
got
to
my
heart
that
would
be
fatal
and
the
vermin
here
those
big
brown
bedbugs
they
must
be
like
those
worms
so
vicious
and
hungry
perhaps
there
are
worms
here
too
there
must
be
in
the
dungeon
there
is
a
wound
on
my
foot
i
do
know
how
it
happened
i
was
unconscious
in
that
dark
hole
it
was
just
like
my
old
idea
of
prison
i
could
live
even
a
week
there
it
awful
here
it
is
a
little
better
but
it
never
light
in
this
cell
always
in
semidarkness
and
so
small
and
narrow
no
windows
it
damp
and
smells
so
foully
all
the
time
the
walls
are
wet
and
clammy
smeared
with
blood
too
bedbugs
augh
it
nauseating
not
much
better
than
that
black
hole
with
my
hands
and
arms
chained
to
the
wall
just
a
trifle
better
my
hands
are
not
chained
perhaps
i
could
live
here
a
few
years
no
more
than
three
or
may
be
five
but
these
brutal
officers
no
no
i
could
stand
it
i
want
to
die
i
die
here
soon
anyway
they
will
kill
me
but
i
wo
give
the
enemy
the
satisfaction
they
shall
not
be
able
to
say
that
they
are
torturing
me
in
prison
or
that
they
killed
me
no
i
rather
kill
myself
yes
kill
myself
i
shall
have
to
do
it
with
my
head
against
the
bars
no
not
now
at
night
when
it
all
dark
they
could
save
me
then
it
will
be
a
terrible
death
but
it
must
be
done
if
i
only
knew
about
them
in
new
york
the
girl
and
fedya
it
would
be
easier
to
die
then
what
are
they
doing
in
the
case
are
they
making
propaganda
out
of
it
they
must
be
waiting
to
hear
of
my
suicide
they
know
i
ca
live
here
long
perhaps
they
wonder
why
i
did
suicide
right
after
the
trial
but
i
could
not
i
thought
i
should
be
taken
from
the
court
to
my
cell
in
jail
sentenced
prisoners
usually
are
i
had
prepared
to
hang
myself
that
night
but
they
must
have
suspected
something
they
brought
me
directly
here
from
the
courtroom
perhaps
i
should
have
been
dead
now
young
lady
mister
lady
supper
want
coffee
hold
your
tin
the
trusty
shouts
into
the
door
suddenly
he
whispers
grab
it
quick
a
long
dark
object
is
shot
between
the
bars
into
the
cell
dropping
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
man
is
gone
i
pick
up
the
parcel
tightly
wrapped
in
brown
paper
what
can
it
be
the
outside
cover
protects
two
layers
of
old
newspaper
then
a
white
object
comes
to
view
a
towel
there
is
something
round
and
hard
inside
it
a
cake
of
soap
a
sense
of
thankfulness
steals
into
my
heart
as
i
wonder
who
the
donor
may
be
it
is
good
to
know
that
there
is
at
least
one
being
here
with
a
friendly
spirit
perhaps
it
some
one
i
knew
in
the
jail
but
how
did
he
procure
these
things
are
they
permitted
the
towel
feels
nice
and
soft
it
is
a
relief
from
the
hard
straw
bed
everything
is
so
hard
and
coarse
here
the
language
the
guards
i
pass
the
towel
over
my
face
it
soothes
me
somewhat
i
ought
to
wash
up
my
head
feels
so
heavy
i
have
washed
since
i
got
here
when
did
i
come
let
me
see
what
is
i
do
know
i
think
but
my
trial
it
was
on
monday
the
nineteenth
of
september
they
brought
me
here
in
the
afternoon
no
in
the
evening
and
that
guard
he
frightened
me
so
with
the
lantern
was
it
last
night
no
it
must
have
been
longer
than
that
have
i
been
here
only
since
yesterday
why
it
seems
such
a
long
time
can
this
be
tuesday
only
tuesday
ask
the
trusty
the
next
time
he
passes
i
find
out
who
sent
this
towel
too
perhaps
i
could
get
some
cold
water
from
him
or
may
be
there
is
some
here
my
eyes
are
growing
accustomed
to
the
of
the
cell
i
discern
objects
quite
clearly
there
is
a
small
wooden
table
and
an
old
chair
in
the
furthest
corner
almost
hidden
by
the
bed
is
the
privy
near
it
in
the
center
of
the
wall
opposite
the
door
is
a
water
spigot
over
a
narrow
circular
basin
the
water
is
lukewarm
and
muddy
but
it
feels
refreshing
the
with
the
towel
is
invigorating
the
stimulated
blood
courses
through
my
veins
with
a
pleasing
tingle
suddenly
a
sharp
sting
as
of
a
needle
pricks
my
face
there
a
pin
in
the
towel
as
i
draw
it
out
something
white
flutters
to
the
floor
a
note
with
ear
alert
for
a
passing
step
i
hastily
read
the
penciled
writing
be
shure
to
tare
this
up
as
soon
as
you
reade
it
it
from
a
friend
we
is
going
to
make
a
break
and
you
can
come
along
we
know
you
are
on
the
level
lay
low
and
keep
your
lamps
lit
at
night
watch
the
screws
and
the
stools
they
is
worse
than
bulls
dump
is
full
of
them
and
do
have
nothing
to
say
so
long
will
see
you
tomorrow
a
true
friend
i
read
the
note
carefully
repeatedly
the
peculiar
language
baffles
me
vaguely
i
surmise
its
meaning
evidently
an
escape
is
being
planned
my
heart
beats
violently
as
i
contemplate
the
possibilities
if
i
could
escape
oh
i
should
not
have
to
die
why
have
i
thought
of
it
before
what
a
glorious
thing
it
would
be
of
course
they
would
ransack
the
country
for
me
i
should
have
to
hide
but
what
does
it
matter
be
at
liberty
and
what
tremendous
effect
it
would
make
great
propaganda
people
would
become
much
interested
and
i
why
i
should
have
new
opportunities
the
shadow
of
suspicion
falls
over
my
joyous
thought
overwhelming
me
with
despair
perhaps
a
trap
i
do
know
who
wrote
the
note
a
fine
conspirator
i
prove
to
be
duped
so
easily
but
why
should
they
want
to
trap
me
and
who
some
guard
what
purpose
could
it
serve
but
they
are
so
mean
so
brutal
that
tall
officer
the
deputy
called
him
fellings
he
seems
to
have
taken
a
bitter
dislike
to
me
this
may
be
his
work
to
get
me
in
trouble
would
he
really
stoop
to
such
an
outrage
these
things
happen
they
have
been
done
in
russia
and
he
looks
like
a
the
scoundrel
no
he
wo
get
me
that
way
i
must
read
the
note
again
it
contains
so
many
expressions
i
do
understand
i
should
keep
my
lamps
lit
what
lamps
there
are
none
in
the
cell
where
am
i
to
get
them
and
what
screws
must
i
watch
and
the
stools
i
have
only
a
chair
here
why
should
i
watch
it
perhaps
to
be
used
as
a
weapon
no
it
must
mean
something
else
the
note
says
he
will
call
i
be
able
to
tell
by
his
looks
whether
he
can
be
trusted
yes
yes
that
will
be
best
i
wait
till
oh
i
wish
it
were
here
chapter
ii
the
will
to
live
i
the
days
drag
interminably
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
cell
the
gong
regulates
my
existence
with
depressing
monotony
but
the
tenor
of
my
thoughts
has
been
changed
by
the
note
of
the
mysterious
correspondent
in
vain
i
have
been
waiting
for
his
appearance
yet
the
suggestion
of
escape
has
germinated
hope
the
will
to
live
is
beginning
to
assert
itself
growing
more
imperative
as
the
days
go
by
i
wonder
that
my
mind
dwells
upon
suicide
more
and
more
rarely
ever
more
cursorily
the
thought
of
fills
me
with
dismay
every
possibility
of
escape
must
first
be
exhausted
i
reassure
my
troubled
conscience
surely
i
have
no
fear
of
death
when
the
proper
time
arrives
but
haste
would
be
highly
imprudent
worse
quite
unnecessary
indeed
it
is
my
duty
as
a
revolutionist
to
seize
every
opportunity
for
propaganda
escape
would
afford
me
many
occasions
to
serve
the
cause
it
was
thoughtless
on
my
part
to
condemn
that
man
jamestown
i
even
resented
his
seemingly
unforgivable
delay
in
committing
suicide
considering
the
impossible
sentence
of
seventeen
years
indeed
i
was
unjust
jamestown
is
no
doubt
forming
his
plans
it
takes
time
to
mature
such
an
undertaking
one
must
first
familiarize
himself
with
the
new
surroundings
get
one
bearings
in
the
prison
so
far
i
have
had
but
little
chance
to
do
so
evidently
it
is
the
policy
of
the
authorities
to
keep
me
in
solitary
confinement
and
in
consequent
ignorance
of
the
intricate
system
of
hallways
double
gates
and
winding
passages
at
liberty
to
leave
this
place
it
would
prove
difficult
for
me
to
find
unaided
my
way
out
oh
if
i
possessed
the
magic
ring
i
dreamed
of
last
night
it
was
a
wonderful
talisman
secreted
i
fancied
in
the
dream
by
the
goddess
of
the
social
revolution
i
saw
her
quite
distinctly
tall
and
commanding
the
radiance
of
love
in
her
eyes
she
stood
at
my
bedside
a
smile
of
surpassing
gentleness
suffusing
the
queenly
countenance
her
arm
extended
above
me
half
in
blessing
half
pointing
toward
the
dark
wall
eagerly
i
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
arched
hand
there
in
a
crevice
something
luminous
glowed
with
the
brilliancy
of
fresh
dew
in
the
morning
sun
it
was
a
ring
cleft
in
the
centre
its
scintillating
rays
glorified
the
dark
corner
with
the
aureole
of
a
great
hope
impulsively
i
reached
out
and
pressed
the
parts
of
the
ring
into
a
whole
when
lo
the
rays
burst
into
a
fire
that
spread
and
instantly
melted
the
iron
and
steel
and
dissolved
the
prison
walls
disclosing
to
my
enraptured
gaze
green
fields
and
woods
and
men
and
women
playfully
at
work
in
the
sunshine
of
freedom
and
then
something
dispelled
the
vision
oh
if
i
had
that
magic
heart
now
to
escape
to
be
free
may
be
my
unknown
friend
will
yet
keep
his
word
he
is
probably
perfecting
plans
or
perhaps
it
is
not
safe
for
him
to
visit
me
if
my
comrades
could
aid
me
escape
would
be
feasible
but
the
girl
and
fedya
will
never
consider
the
possibility
no
doubt
they
refrain
from
writing
because
they
momentarily
expect
to
hear
of
my
suicide
how
distraught
the
poor
girl
must
be
yet
she
should
have
written
it
is
now
four
days
since
my
removal
to
the
penitentiary
every
day
i
anxiously
await
the
coming
of
the
chaplain
who
distributes
the
there
he
is
the
quick
nervous
step
has
become
familiar
to
my
ear
expectantly
i
follow
his
movements
i
recognize
the
vigorous
slam
of
the
door
and
the
click
of
the
spring
lock
the
short
steps
patter
on
the
bridge
connecting
the
upper
rotunda
with
the
and
pass
along
the
gallery
the
solitary
footfall
amid
the
silence
reminds
me
of
the
timid
haste
of
one
crossing
a
graveyard
at
night
now
the
chaplain
pauses
he
is
comparing
the
number
of
the
wooden
block
hanging
outside
the
cell
with
that
on
the
letter
some
one
has
remembered
a
friend
in
prison
the
steps
continue
and
grow
faint
as
the
postman
rounds
the
distant
corner
he
passes
the
on
the
opposite
side
ascends
the
topmost
tier
and
finally
reaches
the
ground
floor
containing
my
cell
my
heart
beats
faster
as
the
sound
approaches
there
must
surely
be
a
letter
for
me
he
is
nearing
the
cell
he
pauses
i
ca
see
him
yet
but
i
know
he
is
comparing
numbers
perhaps
the
letter
is
for
me
i
hope
the
chaplain
will
make
no
mistake
range
k
cell
number
a
something
light
flaps
on
the
floor
of
the
next
cell
and
the
quick
short
step
has
passed
me
by
no
mail
for
me
another
hours
must
elapse
before
i
may
receive
a
letter
and
then
too
perhaps
the
faint
shadow
will
not
pause
at
my
door
ii
the
thought
of
my
sentence
is
driving
me
desperate
i
would
make
use
of
any
means
however
terrible
to
escape
from
this
hell
to
regain
liberty
liberty
what
would
it
not
offer
me
after
this
experience
i
should
have
the
greatest
opportunity
for
revolutionary
activity
i
would
choose
russia
the
mostianer
have
forsaken
me
i
will
keep
aloof
but
they
shall
learn
what
a
true
revolutionist
is
capable
of
accomplishing
if
there
is
a
spark
of
manhood
in
them
they
will
blush
for
their
despicable
attitude
toward
my
act
their
shameful
treatment
of
me
how
eager
they
will
then
be
to
prove
their
confidence
by
exaggerated
devotion
to
salve
their
guilty
conscience
i
should
not
have
to
complain
of
a
lack
of
financial
aid
were
i
to
inform
our
intimate
circles
of
my
plans
regarding
future
activity
in
russia
it
would
be
glorious
glorious
s
sh
it
the
chaplain
perhaps
he
has
mail
for
me
may
be
he
is
suppressing
letters
from
my
friends
or
probably
it
is
the
fault
the
mailbag
is
first
examined
in
his
now
the
chaplain
is
descending
to
the
ground
floor
he
pauses
it
must
be
cell
getting
a
letter
now
he
is
coming
the
shadow
is
opposite
my
door
gone
chaplain

moment
please

calling
here

is
it

boy

should

a
splendid
library

fine
library

catalogue
and
you

draw
one
book
every
week
i
missed
library

on
this
range
i
have
to
wait
another
week
but
i
like
to
have
something
in
the
meantime
chaplain

not

have
not
refused
to
work
have

not
been
offered

work

oh

be
assigned

patient
m
boy
but
ca
i
have
something
to
read
now
is
there
a
bible
in
your
cell
a
bible
i
do
believe
in
it
chaplain
my
boy
it
will
do
you
no
harm
to
read
it
it
may
do
you
good
read
it
m
boy
for
a
moment
i
hesitate
a
desperate
idea
crosses
my
mind
all
right
chaplain
i
read
the
bible
but
i
do
care
for
the
modern
english
version
perhaps
you
have
one
with
greek
or
latin
annotations
why
why
m
boy
do
you
understand
latin
or
greek
yes
i
have
studied
the
classics
the
chaplain
seems
impressed
he
steps
close
to
the
door
leaning
against
it
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
prepared
for
a
long
conversation
we
talk
about
the
classics
the
sources
of
my
knowledge
russian
schools
social
conditions
an
interesting
and
intelligent
man
this
prison
chaplain
an
extensive
traveler
whose
visit
to
russia
had
impressed
him
with
the
great
possibilities
of
that
country
finally
he
motions
to
a
guard
let
a
come
with
me
with
a
suspicious
glance
at
me
the
officer
unlocks
the
door
shall
i
come
along
chaplain
he
asks
no
no
it
is
all
right
come
m
boy
past
the
tier
of
vacant
cells
we
ascend
the
stairway
to
the
upper
rotunda
on
the
left
side
of
which
is
the
chaplain
office
excited
and
alert
i
absorb
every
detail
of
the
surroundings
i
strive
to
appear
indifferent
while
furtively
following
every
movement
of
the
chaplain
as
he
selects
the
rotunda
key
from
the
large
bunch
in
his
hand
and
opens
the
door
passionate
longing
for
liberty
is
consuming
me
a
plan
of
escape
is
maturing
in
my
mind
the
chaplain
carries
all
the
keys
he
lives
in
the
warden
house
connected
with
the
prison
he
is
so
fragile
i
could
easily
overpower
him
there
is
no
one
in
the
rotunda
i
stifle
his
cries
take
the
keys
have
a
seat
my
boy
sit
down
here
are
some
books
look
them
over
i
have
a
duplicate
of
my
personal
bible
with
annotations
it
is
somewhere
here
with
feverish
eyes
i
watch
him
lay
the
keys
on
the
desk
a
quick
motion
and
they
would
be
mine
that
large
and
heavy
one
it
must
belong
to
the
gate
it
is
so
big
one
blow
would
kill
him
ah
there
is
a
safe
the
chaplain
is
taking
some
books
from
it
his
back
is
turned
to
me
a
thrust
and
i
lock
him
in
stealthily
imperceptibly
i
draw
nearer
to
the
desk
my
eyes
fastened
on
the
keys
now
i
bend
over
them
pretending
to
be
absorbed
in
a
book
the
while
my
hand
glides
forward
slowly
cautiously
quickly
i
lean
over
the
open
book
in
my
hands
entirely
hides
the
keys
my
hand
touches
them
desperately
i
clutch
the
large
heavy
bunch
my
arm
slowly
rises
my
boy
i
can
not
find
that
bible
just
now
but
i
give
you
some
other
book
sit
down
my
boy
i
am
so
sorry
about
you
i
am
an
officer
of
the
state
but
i
think
you
were
dealt
with
unjustly
your
sentence
is
quite
excessive
i
can
well
understand
the
state
of
mind
that
actuated
you
a
young
enthusiast
in
these
exciting
times
it
was
in
connection
with
homestead
is
it
not
so
m
boy
i
fall
back
into
the
chair
shaken
unmanned
that
deep
note
of
sympathy
the
sincerity
of
the
trembling
voice
no
no
i
can
not
touch
him
iii
at
last
mail
from
new
york
letters
from
the
girl
and
fedya
with
a
feeling
of
mixed
anxiety
and
resentment
i
gaze
at
the
familiar
handwriting
why
did
they
write
before
the
edge
of
expectancy
has
been
dulled
by
the
long
suspense
the
girl
and
the
twin
my
closest
most
intimate
friends
of
yesterday
but
the
yesterday
seems
so
distant
in
the
past
its
very
reality
submerged
in
the
tide
of
events
there
is
a
note
of
disappointment
almost
of
bitterness
in
the
letter
the
failure
of
my
act
will
lessen
the
moral
effect
and
diminish
its
propagandistic
value
the
situation
is
aggravated
by
most
owing
to
his
disparaging
attitude
the
germans
remain
indifferent
to
a
considerable
extent
even
the
jewish
revolutionary
element
has
been
influenced
by
him
the
twin
in
veiled
and
abstruse
russian
hints
at
the
attempted
completion
of
my
work
planned
yet
impossible
of
realization
i
smile
scornfully
at
the
completion
that
failed
even
of
an
attempt
the
damningly
false
viewpoint
of
the
girl
exasperates
me
and
i
angrily
resent
the
disapproving
surprise
i
sense
in
both
letters
at
my
continued
existence
i
read
the
lines
repeatedly
every
word
drips
bitterness
into
my
soul
have
i
grown
morbid
or
do
they
actually
presume
to
reproach
me
with
my
failure
to
suicide
by
what
right
impatiently
i
smother
the
accusing
whisper
of
my
conscience
by
the
right
of
revolutionary
ethics
the
will
to
live
leaps
into
being
peremptorily
more
compelling
and
imperative
at
the
implied
challenge
no
i
will
struggle
and
fight
friend
or
enemy
they
shall
learn
that
i
am
not
so
easily
done
for
i
will
live
to
escape
to
conquer
chapter
iii
spectral
silence
the
silence
grows
more
oppressive
the
solitude
unbearable
my
natural
buoyancy
is
weighted
down
by
a
nameless
dread
with
dismay
i
realize
the
failing
elasticity
of
my
step
the
gradual
loss
of
mental
vivacity
i
feel
worn
in
body
and
soul
the
regular
tolling
of
the
gong
calling
to
toil
or
meals
accentuates
the
enervating
routine
it
sounds
ominously
amid
the
stillness
like
the
portent
of
some
calamity
horrible
and
sudden
unshaped
fears
the
more
terrifying
because
vague
fill
my
heart
in
vain
i
seek
to
drown
my
riotous
thoughts
by
reading
and
exercise
the
walls
stand
immovable
sentinels
hemming
me
in
on
every
side
till
movement
grows
into
torture
in
the
constant
dusk
of
the
windowless
cell
the
letters
dance
before
my
eyes
now
forming
fantastic
figures
now
dissolving
into
corpses
and
images
of
death
the
morbid
pictures
fascinate
my
mind
the
hissing
gas
jet
in
the
corridor
irresistibly
attracts
me
with
eyes
half
shut
i
follow
the
flickering
light
its
diffusing
rays
form
a
kaleidoscope
of
variegated
pattern
now
crystallizing
into
scenes
of
my
youth
now
converging
upon
the
image
of
my
new
york
life
with
grotesque
illumination
of
the
tragic
moments
now
the
flame
is
swept
by
a
gust
of
wind
it
darts
hither
and
thither
angrily
contending
with
the
surrounding
darkness
it
whizzes
and
strikes
into
its
adversary
who
falters
then
advances
with
giant
shadow
menacing
the
light
with
frenzied
threats
on
the
whitewashed
wall
look
the
shadow
grows
and
grows
till
it
mounts
the
iron
gates
that
fall
heavily
behind
me
as
the
officers
lead
me
through
the
passage
you
home
now
the
guard
mocks
me
i
look
back
the
gray
pile
looms
above
me
cold
and
forbidding
and
on
its
crest
stands
the
black
figure
leering
at
me
in
triumph
the
walls
frown
upon
me
they
seem
human
in
their
cruel
immobility
their
huge
arms
tower
into
the
night
as
if
to
crush
me
on
the
instant
i
feel
so
small
unutterably
weak
and
defenceless
amid
all
the
loneliness
the
breath
of
the
grave
is
on
my
face
it
draws
closer
it
surrounds
me
and
shuts
the
last
rays
from
my
sight
in
horror
i
pause
the
chain
grows
taut
the
sharp
edges
cut
into
my
wrist
i
lurch
forward
and
wake
on
the
floor
of
the
cell
restless
dream
and
nightmare
haunt
the
long
nights
i
listen
eagerly
for
the
tolling
of
the
gong
bidding
darkness
depart
but
the
breaking
day
brings
neither
hope
nor
gladness
gloomy
as
yesterday
devoid
of
interest
as
the
at
its
heels
endlessly
dull
and
leaden
the
rumbling
carts
with
their
loads
of
bread
the
tasteless
brown
liquid
the
passing
lines
of
striped
misery
the
coarse
commands
the
heavy
tread
and
then
the
silence
of
the
tomb
why
continue
the
unprofitable
torture
no
advantage
could
accrue
to
the
cause
from
prolonging
this
agony
all
avenues
of
escape
are
closed
the
institution
is
impregnable
the
good
people
have
generously
fortified
this
modern
bastille
the
world
at
large
may
sleep
in
peace
undisturbed
by
the
anguish
of
calvary
no
cry
of
tormented
soul
shall
pierce
these
walls
of
stone
much
less
the
heart
of
man
why
then
prolong
the
agony
none
heeds
none
cares
unless
perhaps
my
comrades
and
they
are
far
away
and
helpless
helpless
quite
helpless
ah
if
our
movement
were
strong
the
enemy
would
not
dare
commit
such
outrages
knowing
that
quick
and
merciless
vengeance
would
retaliate
for
injustice
but
the
enemy
realizes
our
weakness
to
our
everlasting
shame
the
crime
of
chicago
has
not
yet
been
avenged
victis
they
shall
forever
be
the
victims
only
might
is
respected
it
alone
can
influence
tyrants
had
we
strength
but
if
the
judicial
murders
of
failed
to
arouse
more
than
passive
indignation
can
i
expect
radical
developments
in
consequence
of
my
brutally
excessive
sentence
it
is
unreasonable
five
years
indeed
have
passed
since
the
haymarket
tragedy
perhaps
the
people
have
since
been
taught
in
the
bitter
school
of
oppression
and
defeat
oh
if
labor
would
realize
the
significance
of
my
deed
if
the
worker
would
understand
my
aims
and
motives
he
could
be
roused
to
strong
protest
perhaps
to
active
demand
ah
yes
but
when
when
will
the
dullard
realize
things
when
will
he
open
his
eyes
blind
to
his
own
slavery
and
degradation
can
i
expect
him
to
perceive
the
wrong
suffered
by
others
and
who
is
to
enlighten
him
no
one
conceives
the
truth
as
deeply
and
clearly
as
we
anarchists
even
the
socialists
dare
not
advocate
the
whole
unvarnished
truth
they
have
clothed
the
goddess
of
liberty
with
a
religion
the
very
of
bigotry
and
injustice
has
officially
been
declared
henceforth
these
timid
must
be
careful
not
to
tread
upon
the
toes
of
prejudice
and
superstition
soon
they
will
grow
to
respectability
a
party
of
practical
politics
and
sound
morality
what
a
miserable
descent
from
the
peaks
of
nihilism
that
proclaimed
defiance
of
all
established
institutions
they
were
established
hence
wrong
indeed
there
is
not
a
single
institution
in
our
that
deserves
to
exist
but
only
the
anarchists
dare
wage
war
upon
all
and
every
form
of
wrong
and
they
are
few
in
number
lacking
in
power
the
internal
divisions
too
aggravate
our
weakness
and
now
even
most
has
turned
apostate
the
jewish
comrades
will
be
influenced
by
his
attitude
only
the
girl
remains
but
she
is
young
in
the
movement
and
almost
unknown
undoubtedly
she
has
talent
as
a
speaker
but
she
is
a
woman
in
rather
poor
health
in
all
the
movement
i
know
of
no
one
capable
of
propaganda
by
deed
or
of
an
avenging
act
except
the
twin
at
least
i
can
expect
no
other
comrade
to
undertake
the
dangerous
task
of
a
rescue
the
twin
is
a
true
revolutionist
somewhat
impulsive
and
irresponsible
perhaps
with
slight
aristocratic
leanings
yet
quite
reliable
in
matters
of
revolutionary
import
but
he
would
not
harbor
the
thought
we
held
such
queer
notions
of
prison
the
sight
of
a
police
uniform
an
arrest
suggested
visions
of
a
bottomless
pit
irrevocable
disappearance
as
in
russia
how
can
i
broach
the
subject
to
the
twin
all
mail
passes
through
the
hands
of
the
censor
my
correspondence
especially
a
and
an
anarchist
will
be
minutely
scrutinized
there
seems
no
possibility
i
am
buried
alive
in
this
stone
grave
escape
is
hopeless
and
this
agony
of
living
death
i
can
not
support
it
chapter
iv
a
ray
of
light
i
yearn
for
companionship
even
the
mere
sight
of
a
human
form
is
a
relief
every
morning
after
breakfast
i
eagerly
listen
for
the
familiar
on
the
flagstones
of
the
hallway
it
is
the
old
rangeman
sweeping
up
the
sensitive
mouth
puckered
up
in
an
inaudible
whistle
the
prisoner
swings
the
broom
with
his
left
the
top
of
the
handle
pressed
under
the
armpit
prisoner
taking
care
of
a
range
or
tier
of
cells
hello
aleck
how
you
feeling
he
stands
opposite
my
cell
at
the
further
end
of
the
wall
the
broom
suspended
in
i
catch
an
occasional
glance
of
the
kind
blue
eyes
while
his
head
is
in
constant
motion
turning
to
right
and
left
alert
for
the
approach
of
a
guard
how
you
aleck
oh
nothing
extra
i
know
how
it
is
aleck
i
been
through
the
mill
keep
up
your
nerve
you
be
all
right
old
boy
you
young
yet
old
enough
to
die
i
say
bitterly
s
sh
do
speak
so
loud
the
screw
got
long
ears
the
screw
a
wild
hope
trembles
in
my
heart
the
screw
the
puzzling
expression
in
the
mysterious
note
perhaps
this
man
wrote
it
in
anxious
expectancy
i
watch
the
rangeman
his
back
turned
toward
me
head
bent
he
hurriedly
plies
the
broom
with
the
quick
short
stroke
of
the
sweeper
s
sh
he
cautions
without
turning
as
he
crosses
the
line
of
my
cell
i
listen
intently
not
a
sound
save
the
regular
of
the
broom
but

he
chuckles
merrily

some

he
pricks
up
his
ears
and
with
a
quick
gesture
of
warning
tiptoes
away
from
the
cell
in
a
few
minutes
he

here
i
an
old
soldier
was
at
bull
run
run
so
damn
fast
i
lost
my
right
wing
hah
hah
hah
eagerly
i
look
forward
to
the
stolen
talks
with
wingie
they
are
the
sole
break
in
the
monotony
of
my
life
but
days
pass
without
the
exchange
of
a
word
silently
the
prisoner
walks
by
apparently
oblivious
of
my
existence
while
with
beating
heart
i
peer
between
the
bars
for
a
cheering
sign
of
recognition
only
the
quick
wink
of
his
eye
reassures
me
of
his
interest
and
gives
warning
of
the
spying
guard
by
degrees
the
ingenuity
of
wingie
affords
us
more
frequent
snatches
of
conversation
and
i
gather
valuable
information
about
the
prison
the
inmates
sympathize
with
me
wingie
says
they
know
i
on
th
level
i
sure
to
find
friends
but
i
must
be
careful
of
the
stool
pigeons
who
report
everything
to
the
officers
wingie
is
familiar
with
the
history
of
every
keeper
most
of
them
are
rotten
he
assures
me
especially
the
captain
of
the
night
watch
is
fierce
an
an
only
three
screws
are
on
night
duty
in
each
block
but
there
are
a
hundred
overseers
to
run
th
dump
during
the
day
wingie
promises
to
be
my
friend
and
to
furnish
more
pointers
bymby
fly
or
a
detective
chapter
v
the
shop
i
i
stand
in
line
with
a
dozen
prisoners
in
the
anteroom
of
the
office
humiliation
overcomes
me
as
my
eye
falls
for
the
first
time
in
the
full
light
of
day
upon
my
striped
clothes
i
am
degraded
to
a
beast
my
first
impression
of
a
prisoner
in
stripes
is
painfully
vivid
he
resembled
a
dangerous
brute
somehow
the
idea
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
a
wild
tigress
and
i
too
must
now
look
like
that
the
door
of
the
rotunda
swings
open
admitting
the
tall
lank
figure
of
the
deputy
warden
hands
up
the
deputy
slowly
passes
along
the
line
examining
a
hand
here
and
there
he
separates
the
men
into
groups
then
pointing
to
the
one
in
which
i
am
included
he
says
in
his
feminine
accents
none
crippled
officers
take
them
hm
hm
to
number
seven
turn
them
over
to
mr
hoods
fall
in
forward
march
my
resentment
at
the
treatment
is
merged
into
eager
expectation
at
last
i
am
assigned
to
work
i
speculate
on
the
character
of
number
seven
and
on
the
possibilities
of
escape
from
there
flanked
by
guards
we
cross
the
prison
yard
in
close
lockstep
the
sentinels
on
the
wall
their
rifles
resting
loosely
on
crooked
arm
face
the
striped
line
winding
snakelike
through
the
open
space
the
yard
is
spacious
and
clean
the
lawn
well
kept
and
inviting
the
first
breath
of
fresh
air
in
two
weeks
violently
stimulates
my
longing
for
liberty
perhaps
the
shop
will
offer
an
opportunity
to
escape
the
thought
quickens
my
observation
bounded
north
east
and
south
by
the
stone
wall
the
two
blocks
of
the
form
a
parallelogram
enclosing
the
shops
kitchen
hospital
and
on
the
extreme
south
the
quarters
break
ranks
we
enter
number
seven
a
mat
shop
with
difficulty
i
distinguish
the
objects
in
the
dark
room
with
its
small
barred
windows
the
air
is
heavy
with
dust
the
rattling
of
the
looms
is
deafening
an
atmosphere
of
noisy
gloom
pervades
the
place
the
officer
in
charge
assigns
me
to
a
machine
occupied
by
a
lanky
prisoner
in
stripes
jim
show
him
what
to
do
considerable
time
passes
without
jim
taking
the
least
notice
of
me
bent
low
over
the
machine
he
seems
absorbed
in
the
work
his
hands
deftly
manipulating
the
shuttle
his
foot
on
the
treadle
presently
he
whispers
hoarsely
fresh
fish

words
he
is
seized
with
a
fit
of
coughing
prolonged
and
hollow
the
shuttle
has
in
the
meantime
become
entangled
in
the
fringes
of
the
matting
recovering
his
breath
jim
snatches
the
knife
at
his
side
and
with
a
few
deft
strokes
releases
the
metal
to
and
fro
flies
the
gleaming
thing
and
jim
is
again
absorbed
in
his
task
do
bother
me
no
more
he
warns
me
i
behind
wid
me
work
every
muscle
tense
his
long
body
almost
stretched
across
the
loom
in
turn
pulling
and
pushing
jim
bends
every
effort
to
hasten
the
completion
of
the
day
task
the
guard
approaches
how
he
doing
he
inquires
indicating
me
with
a
nod
of
the
head
he
all
right
but
say
hoods
dis
is
no
place
for
de
kid
got
a
spot
sentence
shut

damned
trap
the
officer
retorts
angrily
the
consumptive
bends
over
his
work
fearfully
eyeing
the
keeper
measuring
stick
as
the
officer
turns
away
jim
pleads
mr
hoods

he
wanted
to

bad
but
we
showed
him

he
all
right
now
you

a
long
time

that
you

is
no
playhouse

as
i
am
about
to
resume
my
place
in
the
line
forming
to
march
back
to
the
cells
for
dinner
he
recalls
me
say
aleck
you
better
keep
an
eye
on
that
fellow
jim
he
is
a
little
off
you
know
he
points
toward
my
head
with
a
significant
rotary
motion
ii
the
mat
shop
is
beginning
to
affect
my
health
the
dust
has
inflamed
my
throat
and
my
eyesight
is
weakening
in
the
constant
dusk
the
officer
in
charge
has
repeatedly
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
my
slow
progress
in
the
work
i
give
you
another
chance
he
cautioned
me
yesterday
and
if
you
do
make
a
good
mat
by
next
week
down
in
the
hole
you
go
he
severely
upbraided
jim
for
his
inefficiency
as
instructor
as
the
consumptive
was
about
to
reply
he
suffered
an
attack
of
coughing
the
emaciated
face
turned
but
in
a
moment
he
seemed
to
recover
and
continued
working
suddenly
i
saw
him
clutch
at
the
frame
a
look
of
terror
spread
over
his
face
he
began
panting
for
breath
and
then
a
stream
of
dark
blood
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
jim
fell
to
the
floor
the
steady
whir
of
the
looms
continued
the
prisoner
at
the
neighboring
machine
cast
a
furtive
look
at
the
prostrate
form
and
bent
lower
over
his
work
jim
lay
motionless
the
blood
dyeing
the
floor
purple
i
rushed
to
the
officer
mr
hoods
jim
has
back
to
your
place
damn
you
he
shouted
at
me
how
dare
you
leave
it
without
permission
i
just
get
back
i
tell
you
he
roared
raising
the
heavy
stick
i
returned
to
my
place
jim
lay
very
still
his
lips
parted
his
face
ashen
slowly
with
measured
step
the
officer
approached
what
the
matter
here
i
pointed
at
jim
the
guard
glanced
at
the
unconscious
man
then
lightly
touched
the
bleeding
face
with
his
foot
get
up
jim
get
up
the
nerveless
head
rolled
to
the
side
striking
the
leg
of
the
loom
guess
he
is
shamming
the
officer
muttered
then
he
shook
his
finger
at
me
menacingly
do
you
ever
leave
your
place
without
orders
remember
you
after
a
long
delay
causing
me
to
fear
that
jim
had
been
forgotten
the
doctor
arrived
it
was
rankin
the
senior
prison
physician
a
short
stocky
man
of
advanced
middle
age
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
ordered
the
sick
prisoner
taken
to
the
hospital
did
any
one
see
the
man
fall
he
inquired
this
man
did
the
keeper
replied
indicating
me
while
i
was
explaining
the
doctor
eyed
me
curiously
presently
he
asked
my
name
oh
the
celebrated
case
he
smiled
i
know
frick
quite
well
not
such
a
bad
man
at
all
but
you
be
treated
well
here
berkman
this
is
a
democratic
institution
you
know
by
the
way
what
is
the
matter
with
your
eyes
they
are
inflamed
always
that
way
only
since
i
am
working
in
this
shop
oh
he
is
all
right
doctor
the
officer
interposed
he
only
been
here
a
week
rankin
cast
a
quizzical
look
at
the
guard
you
want
him
here
we
short
of
men
well
am
the
doctor
mr
hoods
then
turning
to
me
he
added
report
in
the
morning
on
sick
list
iii
the
doctor
examination
has
resulted
in
my
removal
to
the
hosiery
department
the
change
has
filled
me
with
renewed
hope
a
disciplinary
shop
to
which
are
generally
assigned
the
hard
cases
inmates
in
the
first
stages
of
mental
derangement
or
exceptionally
unruly
prisoners
the
mat
shop
is
the
point
of
special
supervision
and
severest
discipline
it
is
the
shop
from
which
escape
is
impossible
but
in
the
hosiery
department
a
recent
addition
to
the
local
industries
i
may
find
the
right
opportunity
it
will
require
time
of
course
but
my
patience
shall
be
equal
to
the
great
object
the
working
conditions
also
are
more
favorable
the
room
is
light
and
airy
the
discipline
not
so
stringent
my
has
secured
for
me
immunity
from
machine
work
the
deputy
at
first
insisted
that
my
eyes
were
good
enough
to
see
the
numerous
needles
of
the
hosiery
machine
it
is
true
i
could
see
them
but
not
with
sufficient
distinctness
to
insure
the
proper
insertion
of
the
initial
threads
to
admit
partial
ability
would
result
i
knew
in
being
ordered
to
produce
the
task
and
failure
or
faulty
work
would
be
severely
punished
necessity
drove
me
to
subterfuge
i
pretended
total
inability
to
distinguish
the
needles
repeated
threats
of
punishment
failing
to
change
my
determination
i
have
been
assigned
the
comparatively
easy
work
of
turning
the
stockings
the
occupation
though
tedious
is
not
exacting
it
consists
in
gathering
the
hosiery
manufactured
by
the
knitting
machines
whence
the
product
issues
without
soles
i
carry
the
pile
to
the
table
provided
with
an
iron
post
about
eighteen
inches
high
topped
with
a
small
inverted
disk
on
this
instrument
the
stockings
are
turned
inside
out
by
slipping
the
article
over
the
post
then
quickly
undressing
it
the
hosiery
thus
turned
is
forwarded
to
the
looping
machines
by
which
the
product
is
finished
and
sent
back
to
me
once
more
to
be
turned
preparatory
to
sorting
and
shipment
monotonously
the
days
and
weeks
pass
by
practice
lends
me
great
dexterity
in
the
work
but
the
hours
of
drudgery
drag
with
heavy
heel
i
seek
to
hasten
time
by
forcing
myself
to
take
an
interest
in
the
task
i
count
the
stockings
i
turn
the
motions
required
by
each
operation
and
the
amount
accomplished
within
a
given
time
but
in
spite
of
these
efforts
my
mind
persistently
reverts
to
unprofitable
subjects
my
friends
and
the
propaganda
the
terrible
injustice
of
my
excessive
sentence
suicide
and
escape
my
nights
are
restless
oppressed
with
a
nameless
weight
or
tormented
by
dread
i
awake
with
a
start
breathless
and
affrighted
to
experience
the
momentary
relief
of
danger
past
but
the
next
instant
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
consciousness
of
my
surroundings
and
plunged
into
rage
and
despair
powerless
hopeless
thus
day
succeeds
night
and
night
succeeds
day
in
the
ceaseless
struggle
of
hope
and
discouragement
of
life
and
death
amid
the
externally
placid
tenor
of
my
pennsylvania
nightmare
chapter
vi
my
first
letter
i
direct
to
box
a
allegheny
city
october
dear
sister
it
is
just
a
month
a
month
since
my
coming
here
i
keep
wondering
can
such
a
world
of
misery
and
torture
be
compressed
into
one
short
month
how
i
have
longed
for
this
opportunity
you
will
understand
a
month
stay
is
required
before
we
are
permitted
to
write
but
many
many
long
letters
i
have
written
to
you
in
my
mind
dear
sonya
where
shall
i
begin
now
my
space
is
very
limited
and
i
have
so
much
to
say
to
you
and
to
the
i
received
your
letters
you
need
not
wait
till
you
hear
from
me
keep
on
writing
i
am
allowed
to
receive
all
mail
sent
of
moral
contents
in
the
phraseology
of
the
rules
and
i
shall
write
whenever
i
may
dear
sonya
i
sense
bitterness
and
disappointment
in
your
letter
why
do
you
speak
of
failure
you
at
least
you
and
fedya
should
not
have
your
judgment
obscured
by
the
mere
accident
of
physical
results
your
lines
pained
and
grieved
me
beyond
words
not
because
you
should
write
thus
but
that
you
even
you
should
thus
need
i
enlarge
true
morality
deals
with
motives
not
consequences
i
can
not
believe
that
we
differ
on
this
point
i
fully
understand
what
a
terrible
blow
the
apostasy
of
wurst
must
have
been
to
you
but
however
it
may
minimize
the
effect
it
can
not
possibly
alter
the
fact
or
its
character
this
you
seem
to
have
lost
sight
of
in
spite
of
wurst
a
great
deal
could
have
been
accomplished
i
do
know
whether
it
has
been
done
your
letter
is
very
meagre
on
this
point
yet
it
is
of
supreme
interest
to
me
but
i
know
sonya
of
this
one
thing
at
least
i
am
sure
you
will
do
all
that
is
in
your
power
perhaps
it
is
not
much
but
the
twin
and
part
of
orchard
street
will
be
with
you
why
that
note
of
disappointment
almost
of
resentment
as
to
tolstogub
relation
to
the
darwinian
theory
you
must
consider
that
the
layman
can
not
judge
of
the
intricacies
of
scientific
hypotheses
the
scientist
would
justly
object
to
such
presumption
i
embrace
you
both
the
future
is
dark
but
then
who
knows
write
often
tell
me
about
the
movement
yourself
and
friends
it
will
help
to
keep
me
in
touch
with
the
outside
world
which
daily
seems
to
recede
further
i
clutch
desperately
at
the
thread
that
still
binds
me
to
the
living
it
seems
to
unravel
in
my
hands
the
thin
skeins
are
breaking
one
by
one
my
hold
is
slackening
but
the
sonya
thread
i
know
will
remain
taut
and
strong
i
have
always
called
you
the
immutable
alex
the
girl
also
referred
to
as
sonya
musick
and
sailor
john
most
orchard
street
the
hall
in
which
the
first
jewish
anarchist
gatherings
were
held
in
new
york
an
allusion
to
the
aid
of
the
jewish
comrades
tolstogub
the
author

nickname
the
expression
signifies
the
continued
survival
of
the
writer
illustration
facsimile
of
prison
letter
reduced
ii
i
posted
the
letter
in
the
prisoners
when
the
line
formed
for
work
this
morning
but
the
moment
the
missive
left
my
hands
i
was
seized
with
a
great
longing
oh
if
some
occult
means
would
transform
me
into
that
slip
of
paper
i
should
now
be
hidden
in
that
green
box
with
bated
breath
i
flatten
myself
in
the
darkest
recess
and
wait
for
the
chaplain
to
collect
the
mail
my
heart
beats
tumultuously
as
the
wild
fancy
flutters
in
my
brain
i
am
oblivious
of
the
forming
lines
the
sharp
commands
the
heavy
tread
automatically
i
turn
the
hosiery
counting
one
two
one
pair
three
four
two
pair
whose
voice
is
it
i
hear
i
surely
know
the
man
there
is
something
familiar
about
him
he
bends
over
the
looping
machines
and
gathers
the
stockings
now
he
is
counting
one
two
one
pair
three
four
two
pair
just
like
myself
why
he
looks
like
myself
and
the
men
all
seem
to
think
it
is
ha
ha
ha
the
officer
also
i
just
heard
him
say
aleck
work
a
little
faster
ca
you
see
the
piles
there
you
falling
behind
he
thinks
it
i
what
a
clever
substitution
and
all
the
while
the
real
me
is
snugly
lying
here
in
the
green
box
peeping
through
the
keyhole
on
the
watch
for
the
postman
i
hear
a
footstep
perhaps
it
is
the
chaplain
he
will
open
the
box
with
his
quick
nervous
hands
seize
a
handful
of
letters
and
thrust
them
into
the
large
pocket
of
his
black
serge
coat
there
are
so
many
letters
here
i
slip
among
them
into
the
large
pocket
the
chaplain
will
not
notice
me
he
think
it
just
a
letter
ha
ha
he
scrutinize
every
word
for
it
the
letter
of
a
his
first
one
too
but
i
am
safe
i
invisible
and
when
they
call
the
roll
they
will
take
that
man
there
for
me
he
is
counting
nineteen
twenty
ten
pair
what
was
that
oh
yes
that
my
sentence
the
imbeciles
they
think
i
am
going
to
serve
it
i
kill
myself
first
but
it
will
not
be
necessary
thank
goodness
it
was
such
a
lucky
thought
this
going
out
in
my
letter
but
what
has
become
of
the
chaplain
if
he
only
come
why
is
he
so
long
they
might
miss
me
in
the
shop
no
no
that
man
is
there
he
is
turning
the
stockings
they
do
know
i
am
here
in
the
box
the
chaplain
know
it
either
i
am
invisible
he
think
it
a
letter
when
he
puts
me
in
his
pocket
and
then
he
seal
me
in
an
envelope
and
address
i
must
flatten
myself
so
his
hand
should
feel
and
he
address
me
to
sonya
he
not
know
whom
he
is
sending
to
her
he
does
know
who
she
is
either
the
is
splendid
we
must
keep
it
up
keep
it
up
why
it
will
not
be
necessary
after
he
mails
me
we
do
need
to
write
any
more
it
is
well
too
i
have
so
much
to
tell
sonya
and
it
would
pass
the
censor
but
it
all
right
now
they
throw
the
letters
into
the
bag
there
be
many
of
them
this
is
general
letter
day
i
hide
in
the
pile
and
they
pass
me
through
the
on
to
new
york
dear
dear
new
york
i
have
been
away
so
long
only
a
month
well
i
must
be
patient
and
not
breathe
so
loud
when
i
get
to
new
york
i
shall
not
go
at
once
into
the
house
sonya
might
get
frightened
i
first
peep
in
through
the
window
i
wonder
what
she
be
doing
and
who
will
be
at
home
yes
fedya

be
there
and
perhaps
claus
and
how
surprised
they
all
be
sonya

embrace
me
she
throw
her
arms
around
my
neck
they
feel
so
soft
and
warm
hey
there

you
deaf
fall
in
line
dazed
bewildered
i
see
the
angry
face
of
the
guard
before
me
the
striped
men
pass
me
enveloped
in
a
mist
i
grasp
the
turner
the
iron
feels
cold
chills
shake
my
frame
and
the
bundle
of
hosiery
drops
from
my
hand
fall
in
line
i

one

eh

sucker
you
chapter
vii
wingie
the
hours
at
work
help
to
dull
the
acute
consciousness
of
my
environment
the
hosiery
department
is
past
the
stage
of
experiment
the
introduction
of
additional
knitting
machines
has
enlarged
my
task
necessitating
increased
effort
and
more
sedulous
application
the
shop
routine
now
demands
all
my
attention
it
leaves
little
time
for
thinking
or
brooding
my
physical
condition
alarms
me
the
morning
hours
completely
exhaust
me
and
i
am
barely
able
to
keep
up
with
the
line
returning
to
the
for
the
noon
meal
a
feeling
of
lassitude
possesses
me
my
feet
drag
heavily
and
i
experience
great
difficulty
in
mastering
my
sleepiness
i
have
grown
indifferent
to
the
meals
the
odor
of
food
nauseates
me
i
am
nervous
and
morbid
the
sight
of
a
striped
prisoner
disgusts
me
the
proximity
of
a
guard
enrages
me
the
shop
officer
has
repeatedly
warned
me
against
my
disrespectful
and
surly
manner
but
i
am
indifferent
to
consequences
what
matter
what
happens
my
waning
strength
is
a
source
of
satisfaction
perhaps
it
indicates
the
approach
of
death
the
thought
pleases
me
in
a
quiet
impersonal
way
there
will
be
no
more
suffering
no
anguish
the
world
at
large
is
it
is
centered
in
me
and
yet
i
myself
stand
aloof
and
see
it
falling
into
gradual
peace
and
quiet
into
extinction
back
in
my
cell
after
the
day
work
i
leave
the
evening
meal
of
bread
and
coffee
untouched
my
candle
remains
unlit
i
sit
listlessly
in
the
gathering
dusk
conscious
only
of
the
longing
to
hear
the
gong
deep
bass
the
three
bells
tolling
the
order
to
retire
i
welcome
the
blessed
permission
to
fall
into
bed
the
coarse
straw
mattress
beckons
invitingly
i
yearn
for
sleep
for
oblivion
occasional
mail
from
friends
rouses
me
from
my
apathy
but
the
awakening
is
brief
the
tone
of
the
letter
is
guarded
their
contents
too
general
in
character
the
matters
that
might
kindle
my
interest
are
missing
the
world
and
its
problems
are
drifting
from
my
horizon
i
am
cast
into
the
darkness
no
ray
of
sunshine
holds
out
the
promise
of
spring
at
times
the
realization
of
my
fate
is
borne
in
upon
me
with
the
violence
of
a
shock
and
i
am
engulfed
in
despair
now
threatening
to
break
down
the
barriers
of
sanity
now
affording
melancholy
satisfaction
in
the
wild
play
of
fancy
existence
grows
more
and
more
unbearable
with
the
contrast
of
dream
and
reality
weary
of
the
day
routine
i
welcome
the
solitude
of
the
cell
impatient
even
of
the
greeting
of
the
passing
convict
i
shrink
from
the
uninvited
familiarity
of
these
men
the
horizontal
gray
and
black
constantly
reviving
the
image
of
the
tigress
with
her
stealthy
vicious
cunning
they
are
not
of
world
i
would
aid
them
as
in
duty
bound
to
the
victims
of
social
injustice
but
i
can
not
be
friends
with
them
they
do
not
belong
to
the
people
to
whose
service
my
life
is
consecrated
unfortunates
indeed
yet
parasites
upon
the
producers
less
in
degree
but
no
less
in
kind
than
the
rich
exploiters
by
virtue
of
my
principles
rather
than
their
deserts
i
must
give
them
my
intellectual
sympathy
they
touch
no
chord
in
my
heart
only
wingie
seems
different
there
is
a
gentle
note
about
his
manner
that
breathes
cheer
and
encouragement
often
i
long
for
his
presence
yet
he
seldom
finds
opportunity
to
talk
with
me
save
sundays
during
church
service
when
i
remain
in
the
cell
perhaps
i
may
see
him
he
must
be
careful
of
the
block
captain
on
his
rounds
of
the
galleries
counting
the
church
delinquents
the
captain
is
passing
on
the
range
now
i
recognize
the
uncertain
step
instantly
ready
to
halt
at
the
sight
of
a
face
behind
the
bars
now
he
is
at
the
cell
he
pencils
in
his
the
number
on
the
wooden
block
over
the
door
a
inmates
of
catholic
faith
are
excused
from
attending
protestant
service
and
catholic
he
asks
mechanically
then
looking
up
he
frowns
on
me
you
no
catholic
berkman
what
stay
in
for
i
am
an
atheist
a
what
an
atheist
a
oh
an
infidel

the
wooden
stairs

beneath
the
officer

has
turned

corner

take
advantage

will
come

hustlin
best
thing
for
the
blues
kiddie
for
a
moment
he
pauses
in
his
hurried
whisper
the
soft
eyes
are
full
of
sympathy
the
lips
smile
encouragingly
he
leans
the
broom
against
the
door
glances
quickly
around
hesitates
an
instant
and
then
deftly
slips
a
slender
delicate
hand
between
the
bars
and
gives
my
cheek
a
tender
pat
involuntarily
i
step
back
with
the
instinctive
dislike
of
a
caress
yet
i
would
not
offend
my
kind
friend
but
wingie
must
have
noticed
my
annoyance
he
eyes
me
critically
wonderingly
presently
picking
up
the
broom
he
says
with
a
touch
of
diffidence
you
are
all
right
aleck
i
like
you
for
jest
wanted
t
try
you
see
how
me
wingie
oh
you
ai
next
well
you
see
he
hesitates
a
faint
flush
stealing
over
his
prison
pallor
you
see
aleck
it
oh
wait
till
i
pipe
th
screw
poor
wingie
the
ruse
is
too
transparent
to
hide
his
embarrassment
i
can
distinctly
follow
the
step
of
the
block
captain
on
the
upper
galleries
he
is
the
sole
officer
in
the
during
church
service
the
unlocking
of
the
yard
door
would
apprise
us
of
the
entrance
of
a
guard
before
the
latter
could
observe
wingie
at
my
cell
i
ponder
over
the
flimsy
excuse
why
did
wingie
leave
me
his
flushed
face
the
halting
speech
of
the
usually
loquacious
rangeman
the
subterfuge
employed
to
sneak
off
as
he
himself
would
characterize
his
hasty
departure
all
seem
very
peculiar
what
could
he
have
meant
by
trying
me
but
before
i
have
time
to
evolve
a
satisfactory
explanation
i
hear
wingie
tiptoeing
back
it
all
right
aleck
they
wo
come
from
the
chapel
for
a
good
while
yet

his
manner
is
angry
but
the
tremor
in
his
voice
sends
a
ray
of
warmth
to
my
heart
impulsively
i
put
my
hand
between
the
bars
his
firm
clasp
assures
me
of
returned
appreciation

chapter
viii
to
the
girl
direct
to
box
a
allegheny
city
november
my
dear
sonya
it
seems
an
age
since
i
wrote
to
you
yet
it
is
only
a
month
but
the
monotony
of
my
life
weights
down
the
heels
of
time
the
only
break
in
the
terrible
sameness
is
afforded
me
by
your
dear
affectionate
letters
and
those
of
fedya
when
i
return
to
the
cell
for
the
noon
meal
my
step
is
quickened
by
the
eager
expectation
of
finding
mail
from
you
about
eleven
in
the
morning
the
chaplain
makes
his
rounds
his
practiced
hand
shoots
the
letter
between
the
bars
toward
the
bed
or
on
to
the
little
table
in
the
corner
but
if
the
missive
is
light
it
will
flutter
to
the
floor
as
i
reach
the
cell
the
position
of
the
little
white
object
at
once
apprises
me
whether
the
letter
is
long
or
short
with
closed
eyes
i
sense
its
weight
like
the
warm
pressure
of
your
own
dear
hand
the
touch
reaching
softly
to
my
heart
till
i
feel
myself
lifted
across
the
chasm
into
your
presence
the
bars
fade
the
walls
disappear
and
the
air
grows
sweet
with
the
aroma
of
fresh
air
and
flowers
i
am
again
with
you
walking
in
the
bright
july
moonlight
the
touch
of
the
in
your
eyes
and
hair
conjures
up
the
volga
our
beautiful
and
the
strains
of
the
trembling
with
suffering
and
yearning
float
about
me
the
meal
remains
untouched
i
dream
over
your
letter
and
again
i
read
it
slowly
slowly
lest
i
reach
the
end
too
quickly
the
afternoon
hours
are
hallowed
by
your
touch
and
your
presence
and
i
am
conscious
only
of
the
longing
for
my
cell
in
the
quiet
of
the
evening
freed
from
the
nightmare
of
the
immediate
i
walk
in
the
garden
of
our
dreams
and
the
following
morning
at
work
in
the
shop
i
pass
in
anxious
wonder
whether
some
cheering
word
from
my
own
my
real
world
is
awaiting
me
in
the
cell
with
a
glow
of
emotion
i
think
of
the
chaplain
perhaps
at
the
very
moment
your
letter
is
in
his
hands
he
is
opening
it
reading
why
should
strange
eyes
but
the
chaplain
seems
kind
and
discreet
now
he
is
passing
along
the
galleries
distributing
the
mail
the
bundle
grows
meagre
as
the
postman
reaches
the
ground
floor
oh
if
he
does
not
come
to
my
cell
quickly
he
may
have
no
letters
left
but
the
next
moment
i
smile
at
the
childish
thought
if
there
is
a
letter
for
me
no
other
prisoner
will
get
it
yet
some
error
might
happen
no
it
is
impossible
my
name
and
prison
number
and
the
cell
number
marked
by
the
chaplain
across
the
envelope
all
insure
the
mail
against
any
mistake
in
delivery
now
the
dinner
whistle
blows
eagerly
i
hasten
to
the
cell
there
is
nothing
on
the
floor
perhaps
on
the
bed
on
the
table
i
grow
feverish
with
the
dread
of
disappointment
possibly
the
letter
fell
under
the
bed
or
in
that
dark
corner
no
none
there
but
it
ca
be
that
there
is
no
mail
for
me
i
must
look
again
it
may
have
dropped
among
the
blankets
no
there
is
no
letter
thus
pass
my
days
dear
friend
in
thought
i
am
ever
with
you
and
fedya
in
our
old
haunts
and
surroundings
i
shall
never
get
used
to
this
life
nor
find
an
interest
in
the
reality
of
the
moment
what
will
become
of
me
i
do
know
i
hardly
care
we
are
revolutionists
dear
whatever
sacrifices
the
cause
demands
though
the
individual
perish
humanity
will
profit
in
the
end
in
that
consciousness
we
must
find
our
solace
alex
brave
knight
affectionately
applied
to
the
great
river
last
day
of
november
beloved
girl
i
thought
i
would
not
survive
the
agony
of
our
meeting
but
human
capacity
for
suffering
seems
boundless
all
my
thoughts
all
my
yearnings
were
centered
in
the
one
desire
to
see
you
to
look
into
your
eyes
and
there
read
the
beautiful
promise
that
has
filled
my
days
with
strength
and
hope
an
embrace
a
lingering
kiss
and
the
gift
of
lingg
would
have
been
mine
to
grasp
your
hand
to
look
down
for
a
mute
immortal
instant
into
your
soul
and
then
die
at
your
hands
beloved
with
the
warm
breath
of
your
caress
wafting
me
into
peaceful
eternity
oh
it
were
bliss
supreme
the
realization
of
our
day
dreams
when
in
transports
of
ecstasy
we
kissed
the
image
of
the
social
revolution
do
you
remember
that
glorious
face
so
strong
and
tender
on
the
wall
of
our
little
houston
street
hallroom
how
far
far
in
the
past
are
those
inspired
moments
but
they
have
filled
my
hours
with
hallowed
thoughts
with
exulting
expectations
and
then
you
came
a
glance
at
your
face
and
i
knew
my
doom
to
terrible
life
i
read
it
in
the
evil
look
of
the
guard
it
was
the
deputy
himself
perhaps
you
had
been
searched
he
followed
our
every
moment
like
a
famished
cat
that
feigns
indifference
yet
is
alert
with
every
nerve
to
spring
upon
the
victim
oh
i
know
the
calculated
viciousness
beneath
that
meek
exterior
the
accelerated
movement
of
his
drumming
fingers
as
he
deliberately
seated
himself
between
us
warned
me
of
the
beast
hungry
for
prey
the
halo
was
dissipated
the
words
froze
within
me
and
i
could
meet
you
only
with
a
vapid
smile
and
on
the
instant
it
was
mirrored
in
my
soul
as
a
leer
and
i
was
filled
with
anger
and
resentment
at
everything
about
us
myself
the
deputy
i
could
have
throttled
him
to
death
and
at
you
dear
yes
sonya
even
at
you
the
quick
come
to
bury
the
dead
but
the
next
moment
the
unworthy
throb
of
my
agonized
soul
was
stilled
by
the
passionate
pressure
of
my
lips
upon
your
hand
how
it
trembled
i
held
it
between
my
own
and
then
as
i
lifted
my
face
to
yours
the
expression
i
beheld
seemed
to
bereave
me
of
my
own
self
it
was
you
who
were
i
the
drawn
face
the
look
of
horror
your
whole
being
the
cry
of
torture
were
not
the
real
prisoner
or
was
it
my
visioned
suffering
that
cemented
the
spiritual
bond
annihilating
all
misunderstanding
all
resentment
and
lifting
us
above
time
and
place
in
the
afflatus
of
martyrdom
mutely
i
held
your
hand
there
was
no
need
for
words
only
the
prying
eyes
of
the
catlike
presence
disturbed
the
sacred
moment
then
we
spoke
mechanically
trivialities
what
though
the
cadaverous
deputy
with
brutal
gaze
timed
the
seconds
and
forbade
the
sound
of
our
dear
russian
nor
heaven
nor
earth
could
violate
the
sacrament
sealed
with
our
pain
the
echo
accompanied
my
step
as
i
passed
through
the
rotunda
on
my
way
to
the
cell
all
was
quiet
in
the
block
no
whir
of
loom
reached
me
from
the
shops
thanksgiving
day
all
activities
were
suspended
i
felt
at
peace
in
the
silence
but
when
the
door
was
locked
and
i
found
myself
alone
all
alone
within
the
walls
of
the
tomb
the
full
significance
of
your
departure
suddenly
dawned
on
me
the
quick
had
left
the
dead
terror
of
the
reality
seized
me
and
i
was
swept
by
a
paroxysm
of
anguish
i
must
close
the
friend
who
promised
to
have
this
letter
mailed
is
at
the
door
he
is
a
kind
unfortunate
who
has
befriended
me
may
this
letter
reach
you
safely
in
token
of
which
send
me
postal
of
indifferent
contents
casually
mentioning
the
arrival
of
news
from
my
brother
in
moscow
remember
to
sign
sister
with
a
passionate
embrace
your
sasha
louis

one
of
the
chicago
martyrs
who
committed
suicide
with
a
dynamite
cartridge
in
a
cigar
given
him
by
a
friend
chapter
ix
persecution
i
suffering
and
danger
are
quick
teachers
in
the
three
months
of
penitentiary
life
i
have
learned
many
things
i
doubt
whether
the
vague
terrors
pictured
by
my
inexperience
were
more
dreadful
than
the
actuality
of
prison
existence
in
one
respect
especially
the
reality
is
a
source
of
bitterness
and
constant
irritation
notwithstanding
all
its
terrors
perhaps
because
of
them
i
had
always
thought
of
prison
as
a
place
where
in
a
measure
nature
comes
into
its
own
social
distinctions
are
abolished
artificial
barriers
destroyed
no
need
of
hiding
one
thoughts
and
emotions
one
could
be
his
real
self
shedding
all
hypocrisy
and
artifice
at
the
prison
gates
but
how
different
is
this
life
it
is
full
of
deceit
sham
and
pharisaism
an
aggravated
counterpart
of
the
outside
world
the
flatterer
the
backbiter
the
spy
these
find
here
a
rich
soil
the
of
a
guard
portends
disaster
to
be
averted
only
by
truckling
and
flattery
and
servility
fawns
for
the
reward
of
an
easier
job
the
dissembling
soul
in
stripes
whines
his
conversion
into
the
pleased
ears
of
the
christian
ladies
taking
care
he
be
not
surprised
without
tract
or
bible
and
presently
simulated
piety
secures
a
pardon
for
the
angels
rejoice
at
the
sinner
return
to
the
fold
it
sickens
me
to
witness
these
scenes
the
officers
make
the
alternative
quickly
apparent
to
the
new
inmate
to
protest
against
injustice
is
unavailing
and
dangerous
yesterday
i
witnessed
in
the
shop
a
characteristic
incident
a
fight
between
johnny
davis
and
jack
bradford
both
recent
arrivals
and
mere
boys
johnny
a
fellow
works
on
a
knitting
machine
a
few
feet
from
my
table
opposite
him
is
jack
whose
previous
experience
in
a
reformatory
has
put
him
wise
as
he
expresses
it
my
three
months
stay
has
taught
me
the
art
of
conversing
by
an
almost
imperceptible
motion
of
the
lips
in
this
manner
i
learned
from
johnny
that
bradford
is
stealing
his
product
causing
him
repeated
punishment
for
shortage
in
the
task
hoping
to
terminate
the
thefts
johnny
complained
to
the
overseer
though
without
accusing
jack
but
the
guard
ignored
the
complaint
and
continued
to
report
the
youth
finally
johnny
was
sent
to
the
dungeon
yesterday
morning
he
returned
to
work
the
change
in
the
boy
was
startling
pale
and
he
walked
with
a
weak
halting
step
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
machine
i
heard
him
say
to
the
officer
cosson
please
put
me
somewhere
else
why
so
the
guard
asked
i
ca

the
task

make
it

another
machine

cosson

ca

it

in
the
afternoon
when
the
count
was
taken
johnny

eighteen
pairs
short

saw
cosson
approach
johnny
eh
thirty
machine
thirty
he
shouted
you
wo
make
the
task
eh
put
your
coat
and
cap
on
fatal
words
they
meant
immediate
report
to
the
deputy
and
the
inevitable
sentence
to
the
dungeon
oh
cosson
the
youth
pleaded
it
ai
my
fault
so
help
me
god
it
is
it
ai
eh
whose
fault
is
it
mine
johnny
hesitated
his
eyes
sought
the
ground
then
wandered
toward
bradford
who
studiously
avoided
the
look
i
ca
squeal
he
said
quietly
oh
hell
you
ai
got
nothin
to
squeal
get
your
coat
and
cap
johnny
passed
the
night
in
the
dungeon
this
morning
he
came
up
his
cheeks
more
sunken
his
eyes
more
hollow
with
desperate
energy
he
worked
he
toiled
steadily
furiously
his
gaze
fastened
upon
the
growing
pile
of
hosiery
occasionally
he
shot
a
glance
at
bradford
who
confident
of
the
officer
favor
met
the
look
of
hatred
with
a
sly
winking
of
the
left
eye
once
johnny
without
pausing
in
the
work
slightly
turned
his
head
in
my
direction
i
smiled
encouragingly
and
at
that
same
instant
i
saw
hand
slip
across
the
table
and
quickly
snatch
a
handful
of
stockings
the
next
moment
a
piercing
shriek
threw
the
shop
into
commotion
with
difficulty
they
tore
away
the
infuriated
boy
from
the
prostrate
bradford
both
prisoners
were
taken
to
the
deputy
for
trial
with
senior
officer
cosson
as
the
sole
witness
impatiently
i
awaited
the
result
through
the
open
window
i
saw
the
overseer
return
he
entered
the
shop
a
smile
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
resolved
to
speak
to
him
when
he
passed
by
cosson
i
said
with
simulated
respectfulness
may
i
ask
you
a
question
why
certainly
burk
i
wo
eat
you
fire
away
what
have
they
done
with
the
boys
johnny
got
ten
days
in
the
hole

stiff
eh

he
started
the
fight
so
he
wo
have
to
make
the
task
oh
i
next
to
all
right
they
ca
fool
me
so
easy
can
they
burk
well
i
should
say
not
cosson
did
you
see
how
the
fight
started
no
but
johnny
admitted
he
struck
bradford
first
that
enough
you
know
will
be
back
in
the
shop
i
got
off
easy
see
he
a
good
worker
always
makes
more
than
th
task
he
jest
lose
his
supper
guess
he
can
stand
it
ai
much
to
lose
is
there
burk
no
not
much
i
assented
but
cosson
it
was
all
fault
how
so
the
guard
demanded
he
has
been
stealing
johnny
socks
you
did
see
him
do
yes
cosson
i
saw
him
this
look
here
burk
it
all
right
johnny
is
no
good
anyway
he
too
fresh
you
better
say
nothing
about
it
see
my
word
goes
with
the
deputy
the
terrible
injustice
preys
on
my
mind
poor
johnny
is
already
the
fourth
day
in
the
dreaded
dungeon
his
third
time
too
and
yet
absolutely
innocent
my
blood
boils
at
the
thought
of
the
damnable
treatment
and
the
officer
perfidy
it
is
my
duty
as
a
revolutionist
to
take
the
part
of
the
persecuted
yes
i
will
do
so
but
how
proceed
in
the
matter
complaint
against
cosson
would
in
all
likelihood
prove
futile
and
the
officer
informed
of
my
action
will
make
life
miserable
for
me
his
authority
in
the
shop
is
absolute
the
several
plans
i
revolve
in
my
mind
do
not
prove
upon
closer
examination
feasible
considerations
of
personal
interest
struggle
against
my
sense
of
duty
the
vision
of
johnny
in
the
dungeon
his
vacant
machine
and
bradford
smile
of
triumph
keep
the
accusing
conscience
awake
till
silence
grows
unbearable
i
determine
to
speak
to
the
deputy
warden
at
the
first
opportunity
several
days
pass
often
i
am
assailed
by
doubts
is
it
advisable
to
mention
the
matter
to
the
deputy
it
can
not
benefit
johnny
it
will
involve
me
in
trouble
but
the
next
moment
i
feel
ashamed
of
my
weakness
i
call
to
mind
the
hero
of
my
youth
the
celebrated
mishkin
with
an
overpowering
sense
of
my
own
unworthiness
i
review
the
brave
deeds
of
hippolyte
nikitich
what
a
man
he
essayed
to
liberate
chernishevsky
from
prison
ah
the
curse
of
poverty
but
for
that
mishkin
would
have
succeeded
and
the
great
inspirer
of
the
youth
of
russia
would
have
been
given
back
to
the
world
i
dwell
on
the
details
of
the
almost
successful
escape
mishkin
fight
with
the
pursuing
cossacks
his
arrest
and
his
remarkable
speech
in
court
sentenced
to
ten
years
of
hard
labor
in
the
siberian
mines
he
defied
the
russian
tyrant
by
his
funeral
oration
at
the
grave
of
dmokhovsky
his
boldness
resulting
in
an
additional
fifteen
years
of
minutely
i
follow
his
repeated
attempts
to
escape
the
transfer
of
the
redoubtable
prisoner
to
the
petropavloskaia
fortress
and
thence
to
the
terrible
schlüsselburg
prison
where
mishkin
braved
death
by
avenging
the
maltreatment
of
his
comrades
on
a
high
government
official
ah
thus
acts
the
revolutionist
and
i
yes
i
am
decided
no
danger
shall
seal
my
lips
against
outrage
and
injustice
hard
labor
in
the
mines
at
last
an
opportunity
is
at
hand
the
deputy
enters
the
shop
tall
and
gray
slightly
stooping
with
head
carried
forward
he
resembles
a
wolf
following
the
trail
mcpane

moment

aside
conversing
in
low
tones
the
words
kicker
his
kid
reach
my
ears
the
deputy
nods
at
the
overseer
his
steely
eyes
fastened
on
me
in
hatred
ii
i
feel
helpless
friendless
the
consolation
of
wingie
cheerful
spirit
is
missing
my
poor
friend
is
in
trouble
from
snatches
of
conversation
in
the
shop
i
have
pieced
together
the
story
dutch
adams
a
and
the
deputy
favorite
stool
pigeon
had
lost
his
allowance
of
tobacco
on
a
bet
he
demanded
that
wingie
who
was
stakeholder
share
the
spoils
with
him
infuriated
by
refusal
dutch
reported
my
friend
for
gambling
the
unexpected
search
of
wingie
cell
discovered
the
tobacco
thus
apparently
substantiating
the
charge
wingie
was
sent
to
the
dungeon
but
after
the
expiration
of
five
days
my
friend
failed
to
return
to
his
old
cell
and
i
soon
learned
that
he
had
been
ordered
into
solitary
confinement
for
refusing
to
betray
the
men
who
had
trusted
him
the
fate
of
wingie
preys
on
my
mind
my
poor
kind
friend
is
breaking
down
under
the
effects
of
the
dreadful
sentence
this
morning
chancing
to
pass
his
cell
i
hailed
him
but
he
did
not
respond
to
my
greeting
perhaps
he
did
not
hear
me
i
thought
impatiently
i
waited
for
the
noon
return
to
the
block
hello
wingie
i
called
he
stood
at
the
door
intently
peering
between
the
bars
he
stared
at
me
coldly
with
blank
expressionless
eyes
who
are
you
he
whimpered
brokenly
then
he
began
to
babble
suddenly
the
terrible
truth
dawned
on
me
my
poor
poor
friend
the
first
to
speak
a
kind
word
to
me
he
gone
mad
chapter
x
the
yegg
i
weeks
and
months
pass
without
clarifying
plans
of
escape
every
step
every
movement
is
so
closely
guarded
i
seem
to
be
hoping
against
hope
i
am
restive
and
nervous
in
a
constant
state
of
excitement
conditions
in
the
shop
tend
to
aggravate
my
frame
of
mind
the
task
of
the
machine
men
has
been
increased
in
consequence
i
am
falling
behind
in
my
work
my
repeated
requests
for
assistance
have
been
ignored
by
the
overseer
who
improves
every
opportunity
to
insult
and
humiliate
me
his
feet
wide
apart
arms
akimbo
belly
disgustingly
protruding
he
measures
me
with
narrow
fat
eyes
oh
what
the
matter
with
you
he
drawls
get
a
move
on
wo
you
burk
then
changing
his
tone
he
vociferates
do
stand
there
like
a
fool
d
hear
nex
time
i
report
you
to
th
hole
you
go
that
talkin
understand
often
i
feel
the
spirit
of
cain
stirring
within
me
but
for
the
hope
of
escape
i
should
not
be
able
to
bear
this
abuse
and
persecution
as
it
is
the
guard
is
almost
overstepping
the
limits
of
my
endurance
his
low
cunning
invents
numerous
occasions
to
mortify
and
harass
me
the
ceaseless
dropping
of
the
poison
is
making
my
days
in
the
shop
a
constant
torture
i
seek
relief
forgetfulness
rather
in
absorbing
myself
in
the
work
i
bend
my
energies
to
outdo
the
efforts
of
the
previous
day
i
compete
with
myself
and
find
melancholy
pleasure
in
establishing
and
breaking
high
records
for
turning
again
i
tax
my
ingenuity
to
perfect
means
of
communication
with
johnny
davis
my
young
neighbor
apparently
intent
upon
our
task
we
carry
on
a
silent
conversation
with
eyes
fingers
and
an
occasional
motion
of
the
lips
to
facilitate
the
latter
method
i
am
cultivating
the
habit
of
tobacco
chewing
the
practice
also
affords
greater
opportunity
for
exchanging
impressions
with
my
assistant
an
who
introduced
himself
as
boston
red
i
owe
this
development
to
the
return
of
the
warden
from
his
vacation
yesterday
he
visited
the
shop
a
man
with
benevolent
white
beard
and
stately
carriage
he
approached
me
in
company
with
the
superintendent
of
prison
manufactures
is
this
the
celebrated
prisoner
he
asked
a
faint
smile
about
the
rather
coarse
mouth
yes
captain
that
berkman
the
man
who
shot
frick
i
was
in
naples
at
the
time
i
read
about
you
in
the
english
papers
there
berkman
how
is
his
conduct
superintendent
good
well
he
should
have
behaved
outside
but
noticing
the
mountain
of
unturned
hosiery
the
warden
ordered
the
overseer
to
give
me
help
and
thus
boston
red
joined
me
at
work
the
next
day
my
assistant
is
taking
great
pleasure
in
perfecting
me
in
the
art
of
lipless
conversation
a
large
quid
of
tobacco
inflating
his
left
cheek
mouth
slightly
open
and
curved
he
delights
in
recounting
ghost
stories
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
officers
red
is
initiating
me
into
the
world
of
de
road
with
its
free
life
so
full
of
interest
and
adventure
its
romance
joys
and
sorrows
an
interesting
character
indeed
who
facetiously
pretends
to
look
down
upon
the
world
from
the
sublime
heights
of
applied
cynicism
why
red
you
can
talk
good
english
i
admonish
him
why
do
you
use
so
much
slang
it
rather
difficult
for
me
to
follow
you
i
learn
you
pard
see
i
should
have
said
you
not
that
how
they
talk
in
school
have
i
been
there
sure
boy
gone
through
college
went
through
it
with
a
bucket
of
coal
he
amplifies
with
a
sly
wink
he
turns
to
expectorate
sweeping
the
large
shop
with
a
quick
watchful
eye
head
bent
over
the
work
he
continues
in
low
guttural
tones
do
care
for
your
classic
language
i
can
use
it
all
right
all
right
but
give
me
the
lingo
every
time
you
see
pard
i
no
gun
do
need
it
in
me
biz
i
a
yegg
professional
thief
what
a
yegg
red
a
supercilious
world
of
cheerful
idiots
applies
to
my
kind
the
term
a
yegg
then
is
a
tramp
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
care
for
the
life
of
a
bum
a
flush
suffuses
the
prison
pallor
of
the
assistant
you
are
stoopid
as
the
rest
of
he
retorts
with
considerable
heat
and
i
notice
his
lips
move
as
in
ordinary
conversation
but
in
a
moment
he
has
regained
composure
and
a
twinkle
plays
about
his
eyes
sir
he
continues
with
mock
dignity
to
say
the
least
you
are
not
discriminative
in
your
terminology
no
sir
you
are
not
now
lookee
here
pard
you
a
good
boy
but
your
education
has
been
sadly
neglected
catch
on
do
call
me
that
name
again
it
offensive
it
an
insult
entirely
gratuitous
sir
indeed
sir
i
may
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
this
insult
is
quite
supervacaneous
yes
sir
that
i
ai
no
bum
see
no
such
damn
thing
eliminate
the
disgraceful
epithet
from
your
vocabulary
sir
when
you
are
addressing
yours
truly
i
am
a
yagg
y
a
double
g
sir
of
the
honorable
clan
of
yaggmen
some
spell
it
y
e
double
g
but
i
insist
on
the
a
sir
as
grammatically
more
correct
since
the
peerless
word
has
no
etymologic
consanguinity
with
hen
fruit
and
should
not
be
confounded
by
vulgar
misspelling
what
the
difference
between
a
yegg
and
a
bum
all
the
diff
in
the
world
pard
a
bum
is
a
city
bloke
whose
intellectual
horizon
sir
revolves
around
the
back
door
with
a
skinny
as
his
center
of
gravity
he
has
the
nerve
to
forsake
his
native
heath
and
roam
the
wide
world
a
free
and
independent
gentleman
that
the
yagg
me
bye
he
dares
to
be
and
do
all
bulls
notwithstanding
he
lives
aye
he
lives
on
the
world
of
suckers
thank
you
sir
of
them
is
wisely
said
in
the
good
book
shall
increase
and
multiply
like
the
sands
of
the
seashore
or
words
to
that
significant
effect
a
yagg
the
salt
of
the
earth
pard
a
real
yagg
will
not
deign
to
breathe
the
identical
atmosphere
with
a
city
bum
or
gaycat
no
sirree
i
am
about
to
ask
for
an
explanation
of
the
new
term
when
the
quick
short
coughs
of
red
warn
me
of
danger
the
guard

measured

is
the
noon
whistle
interrupts
the
explanation
with
a
friendly
wink
in
my
direction
the
assistant
takes
his
place
in
the
line
in
silence
we
march
to
the
the
measured
footfall
echoing
a
hollow
threat
in
the
walled
quadrangle
of
the
prison
yard
ii
conversation
with
boston
red
young
davis
and
occasional
other
prisoners
helps
to
while
away
the
tedious
hours
at
work
but
in
the
solitude
of
the
cell
through
the
long
winter
evenings
my
mind
dwells
in
the
outside
world
friends
the
movement
the
growing
antagonisms
the
bitter
controversies
between
the
and
the
defenders
of
my
act
fill
my
thoughts
and
dreams
by
means
of
fictitious
but
significant
names
russian
and
german
words
written
backward
and
similar
devices
the
girl
keeps
me
informed
of
the
activities
in
our
circles
i
think
admiringly
yet
quite
impersonally
of
her
strenuous
militancy
in
championing
my
cause
against
all
attacks
it
is
almost
weak
on
my
part
as
a
terrorist
of
russian
traditions
to
consider
her
devotion
deserving
of
particular
commendation
she
is
a
revolutionist
it
is
her
duty
to
our
common
cause
courage
zeal
is
very
rare
it
is
true
the
girl
fedya
and
a
few
others
hence
the
sad
lack
of
general
opposition
in
the
movement
to
most
attitude
but
communications
from
comrades
and
unknown
sympathizers
germinate
the
hope
of
an
approaching
reaction
against
the
campaign
of
denunciation
with
great
joy
i
trace
the
ascending
revolutionary
tendency
in
arme
i
have
persuaded
the
chaplain
to
procure
the
admission
of
the
ingenious
robert
reitzel
publication
all
the
other
periodicals
addressed
to
me
are
regularly
assigned
to
the
waste
basket
by
orders
of
the
deputy
the
latter
refused
to
make
an
exception
even
in
regard
to
the
of
labor
it
is
an
incendiary
anarchist
sheet
he
persisted
the
arrival
of
the
is
a
great
event
what
joy
to
catch
sight
of
the
paper
snugly
reposing
between
the
legs
of
the
cell
table
tenderly
i
pick
it
up
fondling
the
little
visitor
with
quickened
pulse
it
is
an
animate
living
thing
a
ray
of
warmth
in
the
dreary
evenings
what
cheering
message
does
reitzel
bring
me
now
what
beauties
of
his
rich
mind
are
hidden
in
the
quaint
german
type
reverently
i
unfold
the
roll
the
uncut
sheet
opens
on
the
fourth
page
and
the
stirring
paean
of
hope
prophecy
greets
my
eye
gruss
an
alexander
berkman
for
days
the
music
of
the
dawn
rings
in
my
ears
again
and
again
recurs
the
refrain
of
faith
and
proud
courage

but
in
the
evening
when
i
return
to
the
cell
reality
lays
its
heavy
hand
upon
my
heart
the
flickering
of
the
candle
accentuates
the
gloom
and
i
sit
brooding
over
the
interminable
succession
of
miserable
days
and
evenings
and
nights
the
darkness
gathers
around
the
candle
as
i
motionlessly
watch
its
desperate
struggle
to
be
its
dying
agony
ineffectual
and
vain
presages
my
own
doom
approaching
inevitable
weaker
and
fainter
grows
the
light
feebler
feebler
a
last
spasm
and
all
is
utter
blackness
three

lights
out
alas
mine
did
not

its
permitted
hour
the
sun
streaming
into
the

routs
the
night
and
dispels
the
haze
of
the
city
perhaps
my
little
candle
with
its
bold
defiance
has
shortened
the
reign
of
darkness
who
knows
perhaps
the
brave
uneven
struggle
coaxed
the
sun
out
of
his
slumbers
and
hastened
the
coming
of
day
the
fancy
lures
me
with
its
warming
embrace
when
suddenly
the
assistant
startles
me
say
pard
slept
bad
last
night

look
boozy

surprised
at
my
silence

to
introduce
to
you

a
gentleman

sounded
the
sharps
and
flats
of
life
and
faced
the
most
intricate
network
sir
of
iron
bars
between
york
and
frisco
always
acquitted
himself
with
flying
colors

by
being
wise

a
stiff
upper
lip

the
honorable
courts
of
the
blind
goddess

you
he
holds
the
unturned
stocking
suspended
over
the
post
gazing
at
me
with
cynical
eyes
in
which
doubt
struggles
with
wonder
in
his
astonishment
he
has
forgotten
his
wonted
caution
and
i
warn
him
of
the
officer
watchful
eye
really
alex
well
now
damme

of
this
round
globe

mighty
strange

things
to
surprise

but
do
alex

have
had
such
a
stunnin
blow
since
i
first
met

jimmie
in
oil

should
snicker
he
was
for
sure
never

a
ghost

all
right
ah
right
now
he
doin
a
down
in
kansas
poor
kiddie
well
he
certainly
was
a
surprise
but
many
tempestuous
billows
of
life
sir
have
since
flown
into
the
shoreless
ocean
of
time
yes
sir
they
have
but
i
never
got
such
a
stunner
as
you
just
gave
me
why
man
it
a
a
knockout
to
my
knowledge
of
the
world
sir
to
my
settled
estimate
of
the
world
supercilious
righteousness
well
damme
if
i
ever
believe
it
say
how
old
are
you
alex
i
over
red
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
question
i
asked
you
everythin
me
bye
everythin
you
and
do
know
what
a
kid
is
well
if
it
do
beat
raw
eggs
i
do
know
what
does
green
well
sir
it
would
be
hard
to
find
an
adequate
analogy
to
your
inconsistent
immaturity
of
mind
aye
sir
i
may
well
say
of
soul
except
to
compare
it
with
the
virtuous
condition
of
green
corn
in
the
early
summer
moon
you
know
what
is
do
you
he
asks
abruptly
with
an
evident
effort
to
suppress
a
smile
i
am
growing
impatient
of
his
continuous
avoidance
of
a
direct
answer
yet
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
angry
with
him
the
face
expressive
of
a
conviction
of
universal
wisdom
the
eyes
of
humorous
cynicism
and
the
ludicrous
manner
of
mixing
tramp
slang
with
classic
english
all
disarm
my
irritation
besides
his
droll
chatter
helps
to
while
away
the
tedious
hours
at
work
perhaps
i
may
also
glean
from
this
experienced
some
useful
information
regarding
my
plans
of
escape
well
d
know
a
moon
when
you
see
red
inquires
chaffingly
i
suppose
i
do
i
bet
you
my
corn
dodger
you
do
sir
i
can
see
by
the
tip
of
your
olfactory
organ
that
you
are
steeped
in
the
slough
of
densest
ignorance
concerning
the
supreme
science
of
moonology
yes
sir
do
not
contradict
me
i
brook
no
sceptical
attitude
regarding
my
undoubted
and
proven
perspicacity
of
human
nature
how
that
for
classic
style
eh
that
hold
you
down
a
moment
kid
as
i
was
about
to
say
when
you
interrupted

what
you
did
oh

the
matter
with
you
do
yer
go
now
an
rooin
the
elegant
flight
of
my
rhetorical
pegasus
with
an
insignificant
interpolation
of
mere
fact
none
of
your
lip
now
boy
an
lem
me
develop
this
sublime
science
of
moonology
before
your
wondering
gaze
to
begin
with
sir
moonology
is
an
exclusively
aristocratic
science
not
for
the
pretenders
of
broad
street
and
fifth
avenue
nixie
but
for
the
only
genuine
aristocracy
of
de
road

of
humankind

the
yaggman

to
chaperon

plain
english
sir
i
shall
endeavor
to
generate
within
your
postliminious
comprehension
a
discriminate
conception
of
the
subject
at
issue
sir
by
divesting
my
lingo
of
the
least
shadow
of
imperspicuity
or
ambiguity
moonology
my
marktwainian
innocent
is
the
truly
christian
science
of
loving
your
neighbor

a
nice
little
boy

gee
look
out
the
look
of
bewilderment
on
his
face
startles
me
in
his
excitement
he
had
raised
his
voice
almost
to
a
shout
attracting
the
attention
of
the
guard
who
is
now
hastening
toward
us
who
talkin
here
he
demands
suspiciously
eyeing
the
knitters

against
the
machine

see
the
guard
scrutinizes
the
bared
arm

says
doubtfully

i
hollered
the
officer

to
my
assistant

talkin

do
think

was
pleased
with
the
title
cosson
smiles
at
red
and
passes
on
with
a
final
warning
to
the
boy
do
you
let
me
catch
you
at
it
again
you
hear
during
the
rest
of
the
day
the
overseers
exercise
particular
vigilance
over
our
end
of
the
shop
but
emboldened
by
the
increased
din
of
the
new
knitting
machinery
red
soon
takes
up
the
conversation
again
screws

seriously

why
do
you

why
er
well
i
do
think
it
possible

do
think
there
can
be
such
intimacy
between
those
of
the
same
sex
ho
ho
your
point
why
alex
you
more
of
a
damfool
than
the
casual
observer
sir
would
be
apt
to
postulate
you
do
believe
it
possible
you
do
eh
well
you
jest
gim
me
half
a
chance

i
rival
rockefeller
sir
i
would
me
bye
you
actually
confess
to
such
terrible
practices
you
disgusting
but
i
do
really
believe
it
red
confess
hell
i
confess
nothin
terrible
disgusting
you
talk
like
a
man
up
a
tree
you
holy
are
there
no
women
on
the
road
pshaw
who
cares
for
a
heifer
when
you
can
get
a
kid
women
are
no
good
i
would
look
at
when
i
can
have
my
prushun
oh
it
is
quite
evident
sir
you
have
not
delved
into
the
esoteric
mysteries
of
moonology
nor
tasted
the
mellifluous
fruit
on
the
forbidden
tree
of
a
boy
serving
his
apprenticeship
with
a
tramp
oh
quit
well
you
know
better
before
time
up
me
virtuous
sonny
for
several
days
my
assistant
fails
to
appear
in
the
shop
on
account
of
illness
he
has
been
excused
by
the
doctor
the
guard
informs
me
i
miss
his
help
at
work
the
hours
drag
heavier
for
lack
of
red
companionship
yet
i
am
gratified
by
his
absence
his
cynical
attitude
toward
woman
and
sex
morality
has
roused
in
me
a
spirit
of
antagonism
the
panegyrics
of
are
deeply
offensive
to
my
instincts
the
very
thought
of
the
unnatural
practice
revolts
and
disgusts
me
but
i
find
solace
in
the
reflection
that
red
insinuations
are
pure
fabrication
no
credence
is
to
be
given
them
man
a
reasonable
being
could
not
fall
to
such
depths
he
could
not
be
guilty
of
such
unspeakably
vicious
practices
even
the
lowest
outcast
must
not
be
credited
with
such
perversion
such
depravity
i
should
really
take
the
matter
more
calmly
the
assistant
is
a
queer
fellow
he
is
merely
teasing
me
these
things
are
not
credible
indeed
i
do
believe
they
are
possible
and
even
if
they
were
no
human
being
would
be
capable
of
such
iniquity
i
must
not
suffer
red
chaffing
to
disturb
me
chapter
xi
the
route
sub
rosa
march
girl
and
twin
i
am
writing
with
despair
in
my
heart
i
was
taken
to
pittsburgh
as
a
witness
in
the
trial
of
nold
and
bauer
i
had
hoped
for
an
opportunity
you
understand
friends
it
was
a
slender
thread
but
i
clung
to
it
desperately
prepared
to
stake
everything
on
it
it
proved
a
broken
straw
now
i
am
back
and
i
may
never
leave
this
place
alive
i
was
bitterly
disappointed
not
to
find
you
in
the
courtroom
i
yearned
for
the
sight
of
your
faces
but
you
were
not
there
nor
any
one
else
of
our
new
york
comrades
i
knew
what
it
meant
you
are
having
a
hard
struggle
to
exist
otherwise
perhaps
something
could
be
done
to
establish
friendly
relations
between
rakhmetov
and
mr
gebop
it
would
require
an
outlay
beyond
the
resources
of
our
own
circle
others
can
not
be
approached
in
this
matter
nothing
remains
but
the
inside
developments
a
terribly
slow
process
this
is
all
the
hope
i
can
hold
out
to
you
dear
friends
you
will
think
it
quite
negligible
yet
it
is
the
sole
ray
that
has
again
and
again
kindled
life
in
moments
of
utmost
darkness
i
did
not
realize
the
physical
effects
of
my
stay
here
it
is
five
months
now
till
my
return
from
court
i
suppose
the
excitement
of
being
on
the
outside
galvanized
me
for
the
nonce
my
head
was
awhirl
i
could
not
collect
my
thoughts
the
wild
hope
possessed
me
the
click
of
the
steel
as
i
was
handcuffed
to
the
deputy
struck
my
the
unaccustomed
noise
of
the
streets
the
people
and
loud
voices
in
the
courtroom
the
scenes
of
the
trial
all
absorbed
me
in
the
moment
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
spectator
interested
but
personally
unconcerned
in
the
surroundings
and
these
too
were
far
away
of
a
strange
world
in
which
i
had
no
part
only
when
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
cell
the
full
significance
of
the
lost
occasion
was
borne
in
upon
me
with
crushing
force
but
why
sadden
you
there
is
perhaps
a
cheerier
side
now
that
nold
and
bauer
are
here
i
have
not
seen
them
yet
but
their
very
presence
the
circumstance
that
somewhere
within
these
walls
there
are
men
who
like
myself
suffer
for
an
ideal
the
thought
holds
a
deep
satisfaction
for
me
it
brings
me
closer
in
a
measure
to
the
environment
of
political
prisoners
in
europe
whatever
the
misery
and
torture
of
their
daily
existence
the
politicals
even
in
siberia
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
solidarity
of
appreciation
what
courage
and
strength
there
must
be
for
them
in
the
inspiration
radiated
by
a
common
cause
conditions
here
are
entirely
different
both
inmates
and
officers
are
at
loss
to
class
me
they
have
never
known
political
prisoners
that
one
should
sacrifice
or
risk
his
life
with
no
apparent
personal
motives
is
beyond
their
comprehension
almost
beyond
their
belief
it
is
a
desert
of
sordidness
that
constantly
threatens
to
engulf
one
i
would
gladly
exchange
places
with
our
comrades
in
siberia
the
former
was
suspended
because
of
the
great
misfortune
that
befell
my
friend
wingie
of
whom
i
wrote
to
you
before
this
dove
will
be
flown
by
tiuremshchick
an
old
soldier
who
really
sympathizes
with
wingie
i
believe
they
served
in
the
same
regiment
he
is
a
kindly
man
who
hates
his
despicable
work
but
there
is
a
family
at
home
a
sick
wife
you
know
the
old
tale
i
had
a
hint
from
him
the
other
day
he
is
being
spied
upon
it
is
dangerous
for
him
to
be
seen
at
my
cell
and
so
forth
it
is
all
quite
true
but
what
he
means
is
that
a
little
money
would
be
welcome
you
know
how
to
manage
the
matter
leave
no
traces
i
hear
the
step
it
the

i
bid

i
a
dense
fog
rises
from
the
broad
bosom
of
the
ohio
it
ensnares
the
river
banks
in
its
mysterious
embrace
veils
tree
and
rock
with
sombre
mist
and
mocks
the
sun
with
angry
frown
within
the
house
of
death
is
felt
the
chilling
breath
and
all
is
quiet
and
silent
in
the
iron
cages
only
an
occasional
knocking
as
on
metal
disturbs
the
stillness
i
listen
intently
nearer
and
more
audible
seem
the
sounds
hesitating
and
apparently
intentional
i
am
involuntarily
reminded
of
the
methods
of
communication
practiced
by
russian
politicals
and
i
strive
to
detect
some
meaning
in
the
tapping
it
grows
clearer
as
i
approach
the
back
wall
of
the
cell
and
instantly
i
am
aware
of
a
faint
murmur
in
the
privy
is
it
fancy
or
did
i
hear
my
name
halloa
i
call
into
the
pipe
the
knocking
ceases
abruptly
i
hear
a
suppressed
hollow
voice
that

knocking
is
resumed

can

bootleg
now
jiggaroo
screw
comin
look
out
ii
the
presence
of
my
comrades
is
investing
existence
with
interest
and
meaning
it
has
brought
to
me
a
breeze
from
the
atmosphere
of
my
former
environment
it
is
stirring
the
graves
where
lie
my
soul
dead
into
renewed
life
and
hope
the
secret
exchange
of
notes
lends
color
to
the
routine
it
is
like
a
fresh
mountain
streamlet
joyfully
rippling
through
a
stagnant
swamp
at
work
in
the
shop
my
thoughts
are
engrossed
with
our
correspondence
again
and
again
i
review
the
arguments
elucidating
to
my
comrades
the
significance
of
my
they
too
are
inclined
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
purely
physical
result
the
exchange
of
views
gradually
ripens
our
previously
brief
and
superficial
acquaintance
into
closer
intimacy
there
is
something
in
carl
nold
that
especially
attracts
me
i
sense
in
him
a
congenial
spirit
his
spontaneous
frankness
appeals
to
me
my
heart
echoes
his
grief
at
the
realization
of
most
unpardonable
behavior
but
the
antagonism
of
bauer
is
irritating
it
reflects
his
desperate
clinging
to
the
shattered
idol
presently
however
a
better
understanding
begins
to
manifest
itself
the
big
jovial
german
has
earned
my
respect
he
braved
the
anger
of
the
judge
by
consistently
refusing
to
betray
the
man
who
aided
him
in
the
distribution
of
the
anarchist
leaflet
among
the
homestead
workers
on
the
other
hand
both
carl
and
henry
appreciate
my
efforts
on
the
witness
stand
to
exonerate
them
from
complicity
in
my
act
their
condemnation
as
acknowledged
anarchists
was
of
course
a
foregone
conclusion
and
i
am
gratified
to
learn
that
neither
of
my
comrades
had
entertained
any
illusions
concerning
the
fate
that
awaited
them
indeed
both
have
expressed
surprise
that
the
maximum
revenge
of
the
law
was
not
visited
upon
them
their
philosophical
attitude
exerts
a
soothing
effect
upon
me
carl
even
voices
satisfaction
that
the
sentence
of
five
years
will
afford
him
a
vacation
from
many
years
of
ceaseless
factory
toil
he
is
facetiously
anxious
lest
capitalist
industry
be
handicapped
by
the
loss
of
such
a
splendid
carpenter
as
henry
whom
he
chaffs
on
the
separation
from
his
newly
affianced
the
evening
hours
have
ceased
to
drag
there
is
pleasure
and
diversion
in
the
correspondence
the
notes
have
grown
into
bulky
letters
daily
cementing
our
friendship
we
compare
views
exchange
impressions
and
discuss
prison
gossip
i
learn
the
history
of
the
movement
in
the
twin
cities
the
personnel
of
anarchist
circles
and
collect
a
fund
of
anecdotes
about
albrecht
the
philosophic
old
shoemaker
whose
diminutive
shop
in
allegheny
is
the
center
of
the
radical
with
deep
contrition
bauer
confesses
how
narrowly
he
escaped
the
rôle
of
my
executioner
my
unexpected
appearance
in
their
midst
at
the
height
of
the
homestead
struggle
had
waked
suspicion
among
the
allegheny
comrades
they
sent
an
inquiry
to
most
whose
reply
proved
a
warning
against
me
unknown
to
me
bauer
shared
the
room
i
occupied
in
house
through
the
long
hours
of
the
night
he
lay
awake
with
revolver
cocked
at
the
first
sign
of
a
suspicious
move
on
my
part
he
had
determined
to
kill
me
the
personal
tenor
of
our
correspondence
is
gradually
broadening
into
the
larger
scope
of
theories
methods
of
agitation
and
applied
tactics
the
discussions
prolonged
and
often
heated
absorb
our
interest
the
bulky
notes
necessitate
greater
circumspection
the
difficulty
of
procuring
writing
materials
assumes
a
serious
aspect
every
available
scrap
of
paper
is
exhausted
margins
of
stray
newspapers
and
magazines
have
been
penciled
on
the
contents
repeatedly
erased
and
the
frayed
tatters
microscopically
covered
with
ink
even
an
occasional
from
library
books
has
been
sacrilegiously
forced
to
leave
its
covers
and
every
evidence
of
its
previous
association
dexterously
removed
the
problem
threatens
to
terminate
our
correspondence
and
fills
us
with
dismay
but
the
genius
our
faithful
postman
of
proud
horsethieving
proclivities
proves
equal
to
the
occasion
bob
constitutes
himself
our
commissary
designating
the
broom
shop
in
which
he
is
employed
as
the
base
of
our
future
supplies
the
unexpected
affluence
fills
us
with
joy
the
big
rolls
requisitioned
by
horsethief
exclude
the
fear
of
famine
the
smooth
yellow
wrapping
paper
affords
the
luxury
of
larger
and
more
legible
chirography
the
pride
of
sudden
wealth
germinates
ambitious
projects
we
speculate
on
the
possibility
of
converting
our
correspondence
into
a
magazinelet
and
wax
warm
over
the
proposed
list
of
readers
before
long
the
first
issue
of
the
is
greeted
with
the
encouraging
approval
of
our
sole
subscriber
whose
contribution
surprises
us
in
the
form
of
a
rather
creditable
poem
on
the
blank
last
page
of
the
publication

at
the
happy
acquisition
we
unanimously
crown
him
with
dominion
over
the
department
of
poetry
soon
we
plan
more
pretentious
issues
the
outward
size
of
the
publication
is
to
remain
the
same
three

five
inches
but
the
number
of
pages
is
to
be
enlarged
each
issue
to
have
a
different
editor
to
ensure
equality
of
opportunity
the
readers
to
serve
as
contributing

of

to
be
regulated
by

complete

appalling

that
the
improvident

imperatively
calls
a
halt
we
are
deliberating
policies
of
retrenchment
and
economy
when
unexpectedly
the
arrival
of
two
homestead
men
suggests
an
auspicious
solution
iii
the
presence
of
hugh
dempsey
and
robert
beatty
prominent
in
the
knights
of
labor
organization
offers
opportunity
for
propaganda
among
workers
representing
the
more
radical
element
of
american
labor
accused
of
poisoning
the
food
served
to
the
in
the
mills
dempsey
and
beatty
appear
to
me
men
of
unusual
type
be
they
innocent
or
guilty
the
philosophy
of
their
methods
is
in
harmony
with
revolutionary
tactics
labor
can
never
be
unjust
in
its
demands
is
it
not
the
creator
of
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
every
weapon
may
be
employed
to
return
the
despoiled
people
into
its
rightful
ownership
is
not
the
terrorizing
of
scabbery
and
ultimately
of
the
capitalist
exploiters
an
effective
means
of
aiding
the
struggle
therefore
dempsey
and
beatty
deserve
acclaim
morally
certain
of
their
guilt
i
respect
them
the
more
for
it
though
i
am
saddened
by
their
denial
of
complicity
in
the
scheme
of
wholesale
extermination
of
the
scabs
the
blackleg
is
also
human
it
is
true
and
desires
to
live
but
one
should
starve
rather
than
turn
traitor
to
the
cause
of
his
class
moreover
the
individual
or
any
number
of
them
can
not
be
weighed
against
the
interests
of
humanity
infinite
patience
weaves
the
threads
that
bring
us
in
contact
with
the
imprisoned
labor
leaders
in
the
ceaseless
duel
of
vital
need
against
stupidity
and
malice
caution
and
wit
are
sharpened
by
danger
the
least
indiscretion
the
most
trifling
negligence
means
discovery
disaster
but
perseverance
and
intelligent
purpose
conquer
by
the
aid
of
the
faithful
horsethief
communication
with
dempsey
and
beatty
is
established
with
the
aggressiveness
of
strong
conviction
i
present
to
them
my
views
dwelling
on
the
historic
rôle
of
the
and
the
social
significance
of
conscious
individual
protest
the
discussion
ramifies
the
interest
aroused
soon
transcending
the
limits
of
my
paper
supply
presently
i
am
involved
in
a
correspondence
with
several
men
whose
questions
and
misinterpretations
regarding
my
act
i
attempt
to
answer
and
correct
with
individual
notes
but
the
method
proves
an
impossible
tax
on
our
opportunities
and
kgm
finally
decide
to
publish
an
english
edition

even
get
a
bit
excited
and
forget
that
you
young
sir
are
attuned
to
the
dulcet
symphonies
of
classic
english
but
whenever
that
skunk
of
a
warden
is
the
subject
of
conversation
sir
even
my
usually
imperturbable
serenity
of
spirit
and
tranquil
stoicism
are
not
equal
to
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
watch
me
sonny
that
yours
truly
spielin
why
look
at
them
dingy
rags

of
that
nigger

books

here
about
eight
months

they
beat
you
out
o
two
months
all
right
suppose
they
obey
their
own
rules
nit
sir
you
are
aware
my
precious
lamb
that
you
are
entitled
to
discard
your
polychromic
vestments
of
zebra
hue
after
a
sojourn
of
six
months
in
this
benevolent
dump
i
bet
you
that
fresh
fish
at
the
loopin
machine
there
came
up
some
days
ago
wo
be
kept
waitin
six
months
for
black
clothes
i
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
recent
arrival
he
is
a
slender
man
with
swarthy
complexion
and
quick
shifting
eye
the
expression
of
guilty
cunning
is
repelling
who
is
that
man
i
whisper
to
the
assistant
like
do
you
permit
me
sir
to
introduce
to
you
the
handiwork
of
his
maker
a
scurvy
gaycat
a
yellow
cur
a
snivelling
fawning
stool
a
filthy
oozy
sneak
a
snake
in
the
grass
whose
very
presence
sir
is
a
mortal
insult
to
a
member
of
my
clan
patrick
gallagher
of
the
honorable
pinkerton
family
sir
gallagher
i
ask
in
astonishment
the
informer
who
denounced
dempsey
and
beatty
the
very
same
the
dirty
snitch
that
got
those
fellows
railroaded
here
for
seven
years
dempsey
was
a
fool
to
bunch
up
with
such
vermin
as
gallagher
and
davidson
he
was
master
workman
of
some
district
of
the
knights
of
labor
why
in
hell
did
he
get
his
own
men
to
do
th
job
goes
to
work
an
hires
a
brace
of
gaycats
sent
to
the
scab
mills
you
savvy
to
sling
hash
for
the
blacklegs
and
keep
posted
on
the
goings
on
see
you
have
oriented
yourself
sir
concerning
the
developments
in
the
culinary
experiment
yes
croton
oil
is
supposed
to
have
been
used
to
make
the
scabs
sick
with
diarrhoea
make
sick
why
me
bye
scores
of
croaked
i
am
surprised
sir
at
your
use
of
such
a
vulgar
term
as
diarrhoea
you
offend
my
aestheticism
the
learned
gentlemen
who
delve
deeply
into
the
bowels
of
earth
and
man
sir
ascribed
the
sudden
and
phenomenal
increase
of
unmentionable
human
obligations
to
nature
the
mysterious
and
extravagant
popularity
of
the
houses
of
ill
odor
sir
and
the
automatic
obedience
to
their
call
as
due
entirely
to
the
dumping
of
a
lot
lousy
bums
sir
into
filthy
quarters
or
to
impurities
of
the
liquid
supply
or
to
pardon
my
frankness
sir
to
intestinal
effeminacy
which
in
flaccid
excitability
persisted
in
relaxation
unseemly
in
christians
some
future
day
sir
there
may
arise
a
poet
to
glorify
with
beauteous
epic
the
heroic
days
of
the
modern
bull
run
an
i
kin
tell
you
laddie
they
run
and
kept
runnin
top
and
bottom
or
some
lyric
bard
may
put
to
hudibrastic
verse
watch
me
climbin
th
parnassus
kid
the
poetic
feet
the
numbers
the
assonance
and
strain
of
the
inspiring
days
when
croton
oil
was
king
yes
sirree
but
for
yours
truly
me
hand
ai
in
such
pies
and
moreover

joory
did

but
there
no
tellin
honest
t
god
aleck
that
rotten
scab
of
a
gallagher

cast
the
pale
hue
of
resolution
if
i
may
borrow
old
billy
shake
slang
sir
over
me
settled
convictions
you
know
in
the
abundant
plenitude
of
my
heterogeneous
experience
with
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
rats
and
gaycats
sir
fortified
by
a
natural
genius
of
no
mean
order
of
vintage
damme
if
i
ever
run
across
such
an
acute
form
of
confessionitis
as
manifested
by
the
lout
on
th
loopin
machine
there
you
know
what
he
done
yesterday
what
sent

there
an
gape
at
me
like
a
wooden
injun
has
the
unexpected
revelation
of
my
magnanimous
generosity
deprived
you
of
articulate
utterance
sir
the
sly
wink
with
which
he
emphasizes
the
offer
and
his
suddenly
serious
manner
affect
me
unpleasantly
with
pretended
indifference
i
decline
to
share
his
delicacies
you
need
those
little
extras
for
yourself
red
i
explain
you
told
me
you
suffer
from
indigestion
a
change
of
diet
now
and
then

do
you
good
but

finished
telling

about
the
new
confession
of

a
thing

got
it
straight
from
th
screw
all
right
i
ca
make
the
damn
snitch
out
unreservedly
i
avow
sir
that
the
incomprehensible
vacillations
of
the
honorable
gentleman
puzzle
me
noodle
and
are
calculated
to
disturb
the
repose
of
a
yagg
in
the
silken
lap
of
morpheus
what
game
anyhow
shall
we
diagnoze
the
peculiar
mental
menstruation
as
er
er
what
your
learned
opinion
my
illustrious
colleague
eh
what
you
grinnin
for
four
eyes
it
a
serious
matter
sir
a
highly
instructive
phenomenon
of
intellectual
vacuity
impregnated
with
the
pernicious
virus
of
pinkertonism
sir
and
transmuted
in
the
alembic
of
carnegie
alchemy
a
judicious
injection
of
persuasive
germs
by
the
sagacious
jurisconsults
of
the
house
of
dempsey
and
lo
three
confessions
mutually
contradictory
and
exclusive
does
that
strike
you
in
th
right
spot
sonny
in
the
second
confession
he
retracted
his
accusations
against
dempsey
what
is
the
third
about
red
retracts
his
retraction
me
bye
guess
why
aleck
i
suppose
he
was
paid
to
reaffirm
his
original
charges
you
not
far
off
after
that
beauty
of
a
judas
cleared
the
man
sandy
notified
reed
and
knox
them
smart
guys
all
right
the
attorneys
of
the
carnegie
company
to
interpret
madame
justicia
sir
in
a
manner
i
know
red
i
interrupt
him
they
are
the
lawyers
who
prosecuted
me
even
in
court
they
were
giving
directions
to
the
district
attorney
and
openly
whispering
to
him
questions
to
be
asked
the
witnesses
he
was
just
a
figurehead
and
a
tool
for
them
and
it
sounded
so
ridiculous
when
he
told
the
jury
that
he
was
not
in
the
service
of
any
individual
or
corporation
but
that
he
acted
solely
as
an
officer
of
the
commonwealth
charged
with
the
sacred
duty
of
protecting
its
interests
in
my
prosecution
and
all
the
time
he
was
the
mouthpiece
of
frick
lawyers
hold
on
kid
i
do
get
a
chance
to
squeeze
a
word
in
edgewise
when
you
start
jawin
think
you
on
th
platform
haranguing
the
crowd
you
ca
convert
so
save
your
breath
man
i
should
want
to
convert
you
red
you
are
intelligent
but
a
hopeless
case
you
are
not
the
kind
that
could
be
useful
to
the
cause
glad
you
next
got
me
sized
up
all
right
eh
well
me
saintly
bye
i
to
serve
the
cause
all
right
all
right
and
the
cause
is
me
with
a
big
m
see
a
fellow
a
fool
not
t
look
out
for
number
one
i
give
it
t
you
straight
aleck
what
them
notions
of
yours
oppressed
humanity
and
suffering
people
fiddlesticks
there
you
go
and
shove
your
damn
neck
into
th
noose
for
the
strikers
but
what
did
them
fellows
ever
done
for
you
eh
tell
me
that
they
wo
do
a
darned
thing
fer
you
catch
swinging
for
the
the
cattle
do
deserve
any
better
than
they
get
that
what
say
i
do
want
to
discuss
these
questions
with
you
red
you
never
understand
anyhow
git
off
now
you
voice
a
sentiment
sir
that
my
adequate
appreciation
of
myself
would
prompt
me
to
resent
on
the
field
of
honor
sir
but
the
unworthy
spirit
of
acerbity
is
totally
foreign
to
my
nature
sir
and
i
shall
preserve
the
blessed
meekness
so
becoming
the
true
christian
and
shall
follow
the
bidding
of
the
master
by
humbly
offering
the
other
cheek
for
that
chaw
of
th
weed
i
gave
you
dig
down
into
your
poke
kid
i
hand
him
the
remnant
of
my
tobacco
remarking
you
lost
the
thread
of
our
conversation
as
usual
red
you
said
the
warden
sent
for
the
carnegie
lawyers
after
gallagher
had
recanted
his
original
confession
well
what
did
they
do
do
know
what
done
but
i
tole
you
that
the
muttonhead
sent
for
th
district
attorney
the
same
day
an
signed
a
third
confesh
why
dempsey
was
tickled
to
death
he
ceases
abruptly
his
quick
short
coughs
warn
me
of
danger
accompanied
by
the
deputy
and
the
shop
officer
the
warden
is
making
the
rounds
of
the
machines
pausing
here
and
there
to
examine
the
work
and
listen
to
the
request
of
a
prisoner
the
youthfully
sparkling
eyes
present
a
striking
contrast
to
the
sedate
manner
and
seamed
features
framed
in
approaching
the
table
he
greets
us
with
a
benign
smile
good
morning
boys
casting
a
glance
at
my
assistant
the
warden
inquires
your
time
must
be
up
soon
red

out
and
back
again
the
officer
laughs
yes

is
hm
hm
back
home
the
thin
feminine
accents
of
the
deputy
sound
sarcastic
did
like
it
outside
red
the
warden
sneers
a
flush
darkens
the
face
of
the
assistant
there
more
skunks
out
than
in
he
retorts
the
captain
frowns
the
deputy
lifts
a
warning
finger
but
the
warden
laughs
lightly
and
continues
on
his
rounds
we
work
in
silence
for
a
while
red
looks
restive
his
eyes
stealthily
following
the
departing
officials
presently
he
whispers
see
me
hand
it
to
aleck
he
knows
i
on
to
all
right

mad

infundibular
dehiscence
of
his
nibs
which
if
i
may
venture
my
humble
opinion

the
dip
for
a
week
boston
red
is
absent
from
work
my
best
efforts
seem
ineffectual
in
the
face
of
the
increasing
mountain
of
unturned
hosiery
and
the
officer
grows
more
irritable
and
insistent
but
the
fear
of
clogging
the
industrial
wheel
presently
forces
him
to
give
me
assistance
and
a
dapper
young
man
and
nervous
takes
the
vacant
place
he
a
dip
johnny
davis
whispers
to
me
a
he
adds
admiringly
pickpocket
i
experience
a
tinge
of
resentment
at
the
equality
implied
by
the
forced
association
i
have
never
before
come
in
personal
contact
with
a
professional
thief
and
i
entertain
the
vaguest
ideas
concerning
his
class
but
they
are
not
producers
hence
parasites
who
deliberately
prey
upon
society
upon
the
poor
mostly
there
can
be
nothing
in
common
between
me
and
this
man
the
new
helper
conscious
superiority
is
provoking
his
distant
manner
piques
my
curiosity
how
unlike
his
scornful
mien
and
proudly
independent
bearing
is
my
youthful
impression
of
a
thief
vividly
i
remember
the
kolya
as
he
was
taken
from
the
classroom
by
a
fierce
gendarme
the
boys
had
been
missing
their
lunches
and
kolya
confessed
the
theft
we
ran
after
the
prisoner
and
he
hung
his
head
and
looked
frightened
and
so
pale
i
could
count
each
freckle
on
his
face
he
did
not
return
to
school
and
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
the
terror
in
his
eyes
haunted
my
dreams
the
brown
spots
on
his
forehead
shaping
themselves
into
fiery
letters
spelling
the
fearful
word
thief
that
a
snap
the
helper
voice
breaks
in
on
my
reverie
he
speaks
in
tones
the
accents
nasal
and
decided
you
need
be
afraid
to
talk
he
adds
patronizingly
i
am
not
afraid
i
impatiently
resent
the
insinuation
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
not
of
me
of
the
officer
i
meant
i
am
not
afraid
of
him
either
well
then
let
talk
about
something
it
will
help
while
away
the
time
you
know
his
cheerful
friendliness
smooths
my
ruffled
temper
the
correct
english
in
striking
contrast
with
the
peculiar
language
of
my
former
assistant
surprises
me
i
am
sorry
he
continues
they
gave
you
such
a
long
sentence
berkman
but
how
do
you
know
my
name
i
interrupt
you
have
just
arrived
they
call
me
al
he
replies
with
a
tinge
of
pride
here
only
three
days
but
a
fellow
in
my
line
can
learn
a
great
deal
in
that
time
i
had
you
pointed
out
to
me
what
do
you
call
your
line
what
are
you
here
for
for
a
moment
he
is
silent
with
surprise
i
watch
his
face
blush
darkly
you
a
dead
oh
excuse
me
berkman
he
corrects
himself
i
sometimes
lapse
into
lingo
under
provocation
you
know
i
meant
to
say
it
easy
to
see
that
you
are
not
next
to
the
way
not
familiar
i
mean
with
such
things
you
should
never
ask
a
man
what
he
is
in
for
why
not
well
er
you
are
ashamed
not
a
bit
of
it
ashamed
to
fall
perhaps
i
mean
to
be
caught
at
it
it
no
credit
to
a
gun
rep
his
reputation
you
understand
but
i
proud
of
the
jobs
i
done
i
pretty
slick
you
know
but
you
do
like
to
be
asked
why
you
were
sent
here
well
it
not
good
manners
to
ask
such
questions
against
the
ethics
of
the
trade
i
suppose
how
sarcastic
we
can
be
berkman
but
it
true
it
not
the
ethics
and
it
is
a
trade
either
it
a
profession
oh
you
may
smile
but
i
rather
be
a
gun
a
professional
i
mean
than
one
of
your
stupid
factory
hands
they
are
honest
though
honest
producers
while
you
are
a
thief
oh
there
no
sting
in
that
word
for
i
take
pride
in
being
a
thief
and
what
more
i
an
a
number
one
gun
you
see
the
point
the
best
dip
in
the
states
a
pickpocket
stealing
nickels
off
passengers
on
the
street
cars
and
me
a
hell
of
a
lot
know
about
it
take
me
for
such
small
fry
do
you
i
work
only
on
race
tracks
you
call
it
work
sure
damned
hard
work
too
takes
more
brains
than
a
whole
shopful
of
your
honest
producers
can
show
and
you
prefer
that
to
being
honest
do
i
i
spend
more
on
gloves
than
a
bricklayer
makes
in
a
year
think
i
so
dumb
i
have
to
slave
all
week
for
a
few
dollars
but
you
spend
most
of
your
life
in
prison
not
by
a
long
shot
a
real
good
gun
always
got
his
fall
money
planted
i
mean
some
ready
coin
in
case
of
trouble
and
a
smart
lawyer
will
spring
you
most
every
time
beat
the
case
you
know
i
never
seen
the
you
could
fix
if
you
got
enough
dough
and
most
judges
too
of
course
now
and
then
the
best
of
us
may
fall
but
it
do
happen
very
often
and
it
all
in
the
game
this
whole
life
is
a
game
berkman
and
every
one
got
his
graft
do
you
mean
there
are
no
honest
men
i
ask
angrily
pshaw
i
just
as
honest
as
rockefeller
or
carnegie
only
they
got
the
law
with
them
and
i
work
harder
than
they
i
bet
you
on
that
got
to
eat
have
i
of
course
he
adds
thoughtfully
if
i
could
be
sure
of
my
bread
and
butter
perhaps
the
passing
overseer
smiles
at
the
noted
pickpocket
inquiring
pleasantly
how
you
doin
al
cosson
hope
you
are
feeling
good

every

a
crook

business

fine
front

about

chapter

the
urge
of
sex
sunday
night
my
new
cell
on
the
upper
gallery
is
hot
and
stuffy
i
can
not
sleep
through
the
bars
i
gaze
upon
the
ohio
the
full
moon
hangs
above
the
river
bathing
the
waters
in
mellow
light
the
strains
of
a
sweet
lullaby
wander
through
the
woods
and
the
banks
are
merry
with
laughter
a
girlish
cadence
rings
like
a
silvery
bell
and
voices
call
in
the
distance
life
is
joyous
and
near
terribly
tantalizingly
near
but
all
is
silent
and
dead
around
me
for
days
the
feminine
voice
keeps
ringing
in
my
ears
it
sounded
so
youthful
and
buoyant
so
fondly
alluring
a
beautiful
girl
no
doubt
what
joy
to
feast
my
eye
on
her
i
have
not
beheld
a
woman
for
many
months
i
long
to
hear
the
soft
accents
feel
the
tender
touch
my
mind
persistently
reverts
to
the
voice
on
the
river
the
sweet
strains
in
the
woods
and
fancy
wreathes
fugues
upon
the
merry
carol
paints
vision
and
image
as
i
pace
the
floor
in
agitation
they
live
they
breathe
i
see
the
slender
figure
with
the
swelling
bosom
the
delicate
white
throat
the
babyish
face
with
large
wistful
eyes
why
it
is
luba
my
blood
tingles
violently
passionately
as
i
live
over
again
the
rapturous
wonder
at
the
first
touch
of
her
maiden
breast
how
temptingly
innocent
sounded
the
immodest
invitation
on
the
velvety
lips
how
exquisite
the
suddenness
of
it
all
we
were
in
new
haven
then
one
by
one
we
had
gathered
till
the
little
new
york
commune
was
complete
the
girl
joined
me
first
for
i
felt
lonely
in
the
strange
city
drudging
as
compositor
on
a
country
weekly
the
evenings
cold
and
cheerless
in
the
midst
of
a
conservative
household
but
the
girl
brought
light
and
sunshine
and
then
came
the
twin
and
manya
luba
remained
in
new
york
but
manya
devoted
little
soul
yearned
for
her
sister
and
presently
the
three
girls
worked
side
by
side
in
the
corset
factory
all
seemed
happy
in
the
free
atmosphere
and
luba
was
blooming
into
beautiful
womanhood
there
was
a
vague
something
about
her
that
now
and
then
roused
in
me
a
fond
longing
a
rapturous
desire
once
it
was
in
new
york
a
year
before
i
had
experienced
a
sudden
impulse
toward
her
it
seized
me
unheralded
unaccountably
i
had
called
to
try
a
game
of
chess
with
her
father
when
he
informed
me
that
luba
had
been
she
was
recovering
now
and
would
be
pleased
to
see
me
i
sat
at
the
bedside
conversing
in
low
tones
when
i
noticed
the
pillows
slipping
from
under
the
girl
head
bending
over
i
involuntarily
touched
her
hair
loosely
hanging
down
the
side
the
soft
dark
chestnut
thrilled
me
and
the
next
instant
i
stooped
and
stealthily
pressed
the
silken
waves
to
my
lips
the
momentary
sense
of
shame
was
lost
in
the
feeling
of
reverence
for
the
girl
with
the
beautiful
hair
that
bewildered
and
fascinated
me
and
a
deep
yearning
suddenly
possessed
me
as
she
lay
in
exquisite
disarray
full
of
grace
and
beauty
and
all
the
while
we
talked
my
eyes
feasted
on
her
ravishing
form
and
i
felt
envious
of
her
future
lover
and
hated
the
desecration
but
when
i
left
her
bedside
all
trace
of
desire
disappeared
and
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
faded
like
a
vision
affrighted
by
the
dawn
only
a
transient
vague
inquietude
remained
as
of
something
unattainable
then
came
that
unforgettable
moment
of
undreamed
bliss
we
had
just
returned
from
the
performance
of
with
sarah
bernhardt
in
her
inimitable
rôle
i
had
to
pass
through
luba
room
on
my
way
to
the
attic
in
the
little
house
occupied
by
the
commune
she
had
already
retired
but
was
still
awake
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
we
talked
of
the
play
she
glowed
with
the
inspiration
of
the
great
tragedienne
then
somehow
she
alluded
to
the
of
the
actresses
i
do
mind
a
fine
bust
exposed
on
the
stage
i
remarked
but
i
had
a
powerful
opera
glass
their
breasts
looked
fleshy
and
flabby
it
was
disgusting
do
you
think
mine
nice
she
asked
suddenly
for
a
second
i
was
bewildered
but
the
question
sounded
so
enchantingly
unpremeditated
so
innocently
eager
i
never
let
me
see
them
i
said
impulsively
no
no
she
cried
in
aroused
modesty
i
ca
i
ca
i
wont
look
luba
see
i
close
my
eyes
just
a
touch
oh
i
ca
i
ashamed
only
over
the
blanket
please
sasha
she
pleaded
as
my
hand
softly
stole
under
the
covers
she
gripped
the
sheet
tightly
and
my
arm
rested
on
her
side
the
touch
of
the
firm
round
breast
thrilled
me
with
passionate
ecstasy
in
fear
of
arousing
her
maidenly
resistance
i
strove
to
hide
my
exultation
while
cautiously
and
tenderly
i
released
the
coverlet
they
are
very
beautiful
luba
i
said
controlling
the
tremor
of
my
voice
you
like
them
really
sasha
the
large
eyes
looked
lustrous
and
happy
they
are
greek
dear
and
snatching
the
last
covering
aside
i
kissed
her
between
the
breasts
i
so
glad
i
came
here
she
spoke
dreamily
were
you
very
lonesome
in
new
york
it
was
terrible
sasha
you
like
the
change
oh
you
silly
boy
do
you
know
what
luba
i
wanted
dear
her
arms
twined
softly
about
me
i
felt
appalled
the
girl
my
revolutionary
plans
flitted
through
my
mind
chilling
me
with
the
pale
hue
of
the
attained
cast
its
shadow
across
the
spell
and
i
lay
cold
and
quiet
on
luba
breast
the
coverlet
was
slipping
down
and
reaching
for
it
my
hand
inadvertently
touched
her
knee
sasha
how
you
she
cried
in
alarm
sitting
up
with
terrified
eyes
i
did
mean
to
luba
how
could
you
that
of
me
i
was
deeply
mortified
my
hand
relaxed
on
her
breast
we
lay
in
silent
embarrassment
it
is
getting
late
sasha
she
tenderly
drew
my
head
to
her
bosom
a
little
while
yet
dear
and
again
the
enchantment
of
the
virgin
breasts
was
upon
me
and
i
showered
wild
kisses
on
them
and
pressed
them
passionately
madly
till
she
cried
out
in
pain
you
must
go
now
dear
good
night
luba
good
night
dearest
you
have
kissed
me
sashenka
i
felt
her
detaining
lips
as
i
left
in
the
wakeful
hours
of
the
night
the
urge
of
sex
grows
more
and
more
insistent
scenes
from
the
past
live
in
my
thoughts
the
cell
is
peopled
with
familiar
faces
episodes
long
dead
to
memory
rise
animated
before
me
they
emerge
from
the
darkest
chambers
of
my
soul
and
move
with
intense
reality
like
the
portraits
of
my
sires
come
to
life
in
the
dark
fearful
nights
of
my
childhood
pert
masha
smiles
at
me
from
her
window
across
the
street
and
a
bevy
of
girls
pass
me
demurely
with
modestly
averted
gaze
and
then
call
back
saucily
in
thinly
disguised
voices
again
i
am
with
my
playmates
trailing
the
schoolgirls
on
their
way
to
the
river
and
we
chuckle
gleefully
at
their
affright
and
confusion
as
they
discover
the
eyes
glued
to
the
we
had
cut
in
the
booth
inwardly
i
resent
nadya
bathing
in
her
shirt
and
in
revenge
dive
beneath
the
boards
rising
to
the
surface
in
the
midst
of
the
girls
who
run
to
cover
in
shame
and
terror
but
i
grow
indignant
at
vainka
who
badgers
the
girls
with
tsiba
tsiba
and
i
soundly
thrash
kolya
for
shouting
nasty
epithets
across
the
school
yard
at
little
nunya
whom
i
secretly
adore
goat
derisively
applied
to
schoolgirls
but
the
note
of
later
days
returns
again
and
again
and
the
scenes
of
youth
recede
into
their
dim
frames
clearer
and
more
frequently
appear
sonya
and
luba
and
the
little
sweetheart
of
my
first
months
in
america
what
a
goose
she
was
she
would
not
embrace
me
because
it
a
great
sin
unless
one
is
married
but
how
slyly
she
managed
to
arrange
kissing
games
at
the
sunday
gatherings
at
her
home
and
always
lose
to
me
she
must
be
quite
a
woman
now
with
a
husband
children
quickly
she
flits
by
the
recollection
even
of
her
name
lost
in
the
glow
of
anarchist
emotionalism
and
the
fervent
enthusiasm
of
my
orchard
street
days
there
flames
the
light
that
irradiates
the
vague
longings
of
my
russian
youth
and
gives
rapt
interpretation
to
obscurely
pulsating
idealism
it
sheds
the
halo
of
illuminating
justification
upon
my
blindly
rebellious
spirit
and
visualizes
my
dreams
on
the
sunlit
mountains
the
sordid
misery
of
my
greenhorn
days
assumes
a
new
aspect
ah
the
wretchedness
of
those
first
years
in
america
and
still
time
woof
and
warp
unroll
the
tapestry
of
life
in
the
new
world
its
joys
and
i
stand
a
lone
stranger
bewildered
by
the
flurry
of
castle
garden
yet
strong
with
hope
and
courage
to
carve
my
fate
in
freedom
the
tsar
is
far
away
and
the
fear
of
his
hated
cossacks
is
past
how
inspiring
is
liberty
the
very
air
breathes
enthusiasm
and
strength
and
with
confident
ardor
i
embrace
the
new
life
i
join
the
ranks
of
the
world
producers
and
glory
in
the
full
manhood
conferred
by
the
dignity
of
labor
i
resent
the
derision
of
my
adopted
country
on
the
part
of
my
family
abroad
resent
it
hotly
i
feel
wronged
by
the
charge
of
having
disgraced
my
parents
respected
name
by
turning
a
low
dirty
workingman
i
combat
their
snobbishness
vehemently
and
revenge
the
indignity
to
labor
by
challenging
comparison
between
the
old
and
the
new
world
behold
the
glory
of
liberty
and
prosperity
the
handiwork
of
a
nation
that
honors
labor
the
loom
of
time
keeps
weaving
lone
and
friendless
i
struggle
in
the
new
land
life
in
the
tenements
is
sordid
the
fate
of
the
worker
dreary
there
is
no
dignity
of
labor
sweatshop
bread
is
bitter
oppression
guards
the
golden
promise
and
servile
brutality
is
the
only
earnest
of
success
then
like
a
clarion
note
in
the
desert
sounds
the
call
of
the
ideal
strong
and
rousing
rolls
the
of
revolution
like
a
flash
in
the
night
it
illumines
my
groping
my
life
becomes
full
of
new
meaning
and
interest
translated
into
the
struggle
of
a
world
emancipation
fedya
joins
me
and
together
we
are
absorbed
in
the
music
of
the
new
humanity
it
is
all
far
far
yet
every
detail
is
sharply
etched
upon
my
memory
swiftly
pass
before
me
the
years
of
complete
consecration
to
the
movement
the
poverty
and
sacrifices
the
feverish
tide
of
agitation
in
the
wake
of
the
chicago
martyrdom
the
evenings
of
spirited
debate
the
nights
of
diligent
study
and
over
all
loom
the
fridays
in
the
little
dingy
hall
in
the
ghetto
where
the
handful
of
russian
refugees
gather
where
bold
imprecations
are
thundered
against
the
tyranny
and
injustice
of
the
existing
and
winged
words
prophesy
the
near
approach
of
a
glorious
dawn
beshawled
women
and
men
and
piously
bearded
steal
into
the
hall
after
synagogue
prayers
and
listen
with
wondering
eyes
vainly
striving
to
grasp
the
strange
jewish
so
perplexedly
interspersed
with
the
alien
words
of
the
new
evangel
how
our
hearts
rejoice
as
with
exaggerated
deference
we
eagerly
encourage
the
diffident
questioner
do
you
really
mean
may
the
good
lord
forgive
me
there
is
no
one
in
heaven
above
late
in
the
evening
the
meeting
resolves
into
small
groups
heatedly
contending
over
the
utterances
the
select
circle
finally
adjourning
to
the
corner
the
obscure
little
tea
room
resounds
with
the
joust
of
learning
and
wit
fascinating
is
the
feast
of
reason
impassioned
the
flow
of
soul
as
the
grows
more
heated
with
the
advance
of
the
night
the
host
diplomatically
pacifies
the
belligerent
factions
gentlemen
gentlemen
the
police
station
is
just
across
the
street
there
is
a
lull
in
the
combat
the
angry
opponents
frown
at
each
other
and
in
the
interim
the
austrian
student
in
his
mellow
voice
begins
an
interminable
story
of
personal
reminiscence
apropos
of
nothing
and
starting
nowhere
but
intensely
absorbing
with
sparkling
eyes
he
holds
us
spellbound
relating
the
wonderful
journey
taking
us
through
the
nevsky
in
petersburg
thence
to
the
caucasus
to
engage
in
the
of
the
tcherkessi
or
enmeshed
in
a
perilous
flirtation
with
an
albanian
beauty
in
a
moslem
harem
he
descants
on
the
philosophy
of
mohammed
imperceptibly
shifting
the
scene
to
the
nile
to
hunt
the
hippopotamus
and
suddenly
interrupting
the
amazing
adventures
by
introducing
an
acquaintance
of
the
evening
my
excellent
friend
the
coming
great
italian
virtuoso
from
odessa
gentlemen
he
will
entertain
us
with
an
aria
from
but
the
circle
is
not
in
a
musical
mood
some
one
challenges
the
student
familiarity
with
the
moslem
philosophy
and
the
twin
hints
at
the
gossiped
intimacy
of
the
austrian
with
christian
missionaries
there
are
protestations
and
loud
clamor
for
an
explanation
the
student
smilingly
assents
and
presently
he
is
launched
upon
the
chinese
sea
in
the
midst
of
a
strange
caravan
trading
tea
at
yachta
and
aiding
a
political
to
escape
to
vladivostok
the
night
pales
before
the
waking
sun
the
twin
yawns
and
i
am
drowsy
with
want
coffee
hey
git
up
there
did
you
hear
th
bell
chapter
xvi
the
warden
threat
i
the
dying
sun
grows
pale
with
haze
and
fog
slowly
the
line
undulates
across
the
shop
and
draws
its
sinuous
length
along
the
gloaming
yard
the
shadowy
waves
cleave
the
thickening
mist
vibrate
ghostlike
and
are
swallowed
in
the
yawning
blackness
of
the
aleck
aleck
i
hear
an
excited
whisper
behind
me
quick
plant
it
the
screw
goin
t
frisk
me
search
something
small
and
hard
is
thrust
into
my
coat
pocket
the
guard
in
front
stops
short
suspiciously
scanning
the
passing
men
break
ranks
the
overseer
approaches
me
you
are
wanted
in
the
office
berk
the
warden
and
sallow
frowns
as
i
am
led
in
what
have
you
got
on
you
he
demands
abruptly
i
do
understand
you
yes
you
do
have
you
money
on
you
i
have
not
who
sends
clandestine
mail
for
you
what
mail
the
letter
published
in
the
anarchist
sheet
in
new
york
i
feel
greatly
relieved
the
letter
in
question
passed
through
official
channels
it
went
through
the
chaplain
hands
i
reply
boldly
it
is
true
such
a
letter
could
never
pass
milligan
cosson
he
turns
to
the
guard
fetch
the
newspaper
from
my
desk
the
warden
hands
tremble
as
he
points
to
the
marked
item
here
it
is
you
talk
of
revolution
and
comrades
and
anarchism
milligan
never
saw
i
sure
it
a
nice
thing
for
the
papers
to
say
that
you
are
editing
from
the
prison
mind
you
editing
an
anarchist
sheet
in
new
york
you
ca
believe
everything
the
papers
say
i
protest
hm
this
time
the
papers
hm
hm
may
be
right
the
deputy
interposes
they
surely
did
make
the
story
hm
hm
out
of
whole
cloth
they
often
do
i
retort
did
they
write
that
i
tried
to
jump
over
the
wall
it
about
thirty
feet
high
and
that
the
guard
shot
me
in
the
leg
a
smile
flits
across
the
warden
face
impulsively
i
blurt
out
was
the
story
inspired
perhaps
silence
the
warden
thunders
you
are
not
to
speak
unless
addressed
remember
mcpane
please
search
him
the
long
bony
fingers
slowly
creep
over
my
neck
and
shoulders
down
my
arms
and
body
pressing
in
my
armpits
gripping
my
legs
covering
every
spot
and
immersing
me
in
an
atmosphere
of
clamminess
the
loathsome
touch
sickens
me
but
i
rejoice
in
the
thought
of
my
security
i
have
nothing
incriminating
about
me
suddenly
the
snakelike
hand
dips
into
my
coat
pocket
hm
what
this
he
unwraps
a
small
round
object
a
knife
captain
let
me
see
i
cry
in
amazement
stand
back
the
warden
commands
this
knife
has
been
stolen
from
the
shoe
shop
on
whom
did
you
mean
to
use
it
warden
i
did
even
know
i
had
it
a
fellow
dropped
it
into
my
pocket
as
we
that
do
you
not
so
clever
as
you
think
it
a
conspiracy
i
cry
he
lounges
calmly
in
the
armchair
a
peculiar
smile
dancing
in
his
eyes
well
what
have
you
got
to
say
it
a
job
explain
yourself
some
one
threw
this
thing
into
my
pocket
as
we
were
coming
oh
we
already
heard
that
it
too
fishy
you
searched
me
for
money
and
secret
letters
that
will
do
now
mcpane
what
is
the
sentence
for
the
possession
of
a
dangerous
weapon
warden
i
interrupt
it
no
weapon
the
blade
is
only
half
an
inch
and
silence
i
spoke
to
mr
mcpane
hm
three
days
captain
take
him
down
in
the
storeroom
i
am
stripped
of
my
suit
of
dark
gray
and
again
clad
in
the
hateful
stripes
coatless
and
shoeless
i
am
led
through
hallways
and
corridors
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
and
thrown
into
the
dungeon
total
darkness
the
blackness
is
massive
palpable
i
feel
its
hand
upon
my
head
my
face
i
dare
not
move
lest
a
misstep
thrust
me
into
the
abyss
i
hold
my
hand
close
to
my
eyes
i
feel
the
touch
of
my
lashes
upon
it
but
i
can
not
see
its
outline
motionless
i
stand
on
one
spot
devoid
of
all
sense
of
direction
the
silence
is
sinister
it
seems
to
me
i
can
hear
it
only
now
and
then
the
hasty
scrambling
of
nimble
feet
suddenly
rends
the
stillness
and
the
gnawing
of
invisible
river
rats
haunts
the
fearful
solitude
slowly
the
blackness
pales
it
ebbs
and
melts
out
of
the
sombre
gray
a
wall
looms
above
the
silhouette
of
a
door
rises
dimly
before
me
sloping
upward
and
growing
compact
and
impenetrable
the
hours
drag
in
unbroken
sameness
not
a
sound
reaches
me
from
the
in
the
maddening
quiet
and
darkness
i
am
bereft
of
all
consciousness
of
time
save
once
a
day
when
the
heavy
rattle
of
keys
apprises
me
of
the
morning
the
dungeon
is
unlocked
and
the
silent
guards
hand
me
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
the
double
doors
fall
heavily
to
the
steps
grow
fainter
and
die
in
the
distance
and
all
is
dark
again
in
the
dungeon
the
numbness
of
death
steals
upon
my
soul
the
floor
is
cold
and
clammy
the
gnawing
grows
louder
and
nearer
and
i
am
filled
with
dread
lest
the
starving
rats
attack
my
bare
feet
i
snatch
a
few
unconscious
moments
leaning
against
the
door
and
then
again
i
pace
the
cell
striving
to
keep
awake
wondering
whether
it
be
night
or
day
yearning
for
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
utterly
forsaken
cast
into
the
stony
bowels
of
the
underground
the
world
of
man
receding
leaving
no
trace
behind
eagerly
i
strain
my
ear
only
the
ceaseless
fearful
gnawing
i
clutch
the
bars
in
desperation
a
hollow
echo
mocks
the
clanking
iron
my
hands
tear
violently
at
the
door
ho
there
any
one
here
all
is
silent
nameless
terrors
quiver
in
my
mind
weaving
nightmares
of
mortal
dread
and
despair
fear
shapes
convulsive
thoughts
they
rage
in
wild
tempest
then
calm
and
again
rush
through
time
and
space
in
a
rapid
succession
of
strangely
familiar
scenes
wakened
in
my
slumbering
consciousness
exhausted
and
weary
i
droop
against
the
wall
a
slimy
creeping
on
my
face
startles
me
in
horror
and
again
i
pace
the
cell
i
feel
cold
and
hungry
am
i
forgotten
three
days
must
have
passed
and
more
have
they
forgotten
me
the
clank
of
keys
sends
a
thrill
of
joy
to
my
heart
my
tomb
will
open
oh
to
see
the
light
and
breathe
the
air
again
officer
is
my
time
up
yet
what
your
hurry
you
only
been
here
one
day
the
doors
fall
to
ravenously
i
devour
the
bread
so
small
and
thin
just
a
bite
only
day
despair
enfolds
me
like
a
pall
faint
with
anguish
i
sink
to
the
floor
ii
the
change
from
the
dungeon
to
the
ordinary
cell
is
a
veritable
transformation
the
sight
of
the
human
form
fills
me
with
delight
the
sound
of
voices
is
sweet
music
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
torn
from
the
grip
of
death
when
all
hope
had
fled
me
caught
on
the
very
brink
as
it
were
and
restored
to
the
world
of
the
living
how
bright
the
sun
how
balmy
the
air
in
keen
sensuousness
i
stretch
out
on
the
bed
the
tick
is
soiled
the
straw
protrudes
in
places
but
it
is
luxury
to
rest
secure
from
the
vicious
river
rats
and
the
fierce
vermin
it
is
almost
liberty
freedom
but
in
the
morning
i
awake
in
great
agony
my
eyes
throb
with
pain
every
joint
of
my
body
is
on
the
rack
the
blankets
had
been
removed
from
the
dungeon
three
days
and
nights
i
lay
on
the
bare
stone
it
was
unnecessarily
cruel
to
deprive
me
of
my
spectacles
in
pretended
anxiety
lest
i
commit
suicide
with
them
it
is
very
touching
this
solicitude
for
my
safety
in
view
of
the
flimsy
pretext
to
punish
me
some
hidden
motive
must
be
actuating
the
warden
but
what
can
it
be
probably
they
will
not
keep
me
long
in
the
cell
when
i
am
returned
to
work
i
shall
learn
the
truth
the
days
pass
in
vain
expectation
the
continuous
confinement
is
becoming
distressing
i
miss
the
little
comforts
i
have
lost
by
the
removal
to
the
single
cell
considerably
smaller
than
my
previous
quarters
my
library
also
has
disappeared
and
the
pictures
i
had
so
patiently
collected
for
the
decoration
of
the
walls
the
cell
is
bare
and
cheerless
the
large
card
of
rules
affording
no
relief
from
the
irritating
whitewash
the
narrow
space
makes
exercise
difficult
the
necessity
of
turning
at
every
second
and
third
step
transforms
walking
into
a
series
of
contortions
but
some
means
must
be
devised
to
while
away
the
time
i
pace
the
floor
counting
the
seconds
required
to
make
ten
turns
i
recollect
having
heard
that
five
miles
constitutes
a
healthy
day
walk
at
that
rate
i
should
make
turns
the
cell
measuring
seven
feet
in
length
i
divide
the
exercise
into
three
parts
adding
a
few
extra
laps
to
make
sure
of
five
miles
carefully
i
count
and
am
overcome
by
a
sense
of
calamity
when
the
peal
of
the
gong
confuses
my
numbers
i
must
begin
over
again
the
change
of
location
has
interrupted
communication
with
my
comrades
i
am
apprehensive
of
the
fate
of
the
strict
surveillance
makes
the
prospect
of
restoring
connections
doubtful
i
am
assigned
to
the
ground
floor
my
cell
being
but
a
few
feet
distant
from
the
officers
desk
at
the
yard
door
watchful
eyes
are
constantly
upon
me
it
is
impossible
for
any
prisoner
to
converse
with
me
the
rangeman
alone
could
aid
me
in
reaching
my
friends
but
i
have
been
warned
against
him
he
is
a
stool
who
has
earned
his
position
as
trusty
by
spying
upon
the
inmates
i
can
expect
no
help
from
him
but
perhaps
the
may
prove
of
service
i
am
planning
to
approach
the
man
when
i
am
informed
that
prisoners
from
the
hosiery
department
are
locked
up
on
the
upper
gallery
by
means
of
the
waste
pipe
i
learn
of
the
developments
during
my
stay
in
the
dungeon
the
discontent
of
the
shop
employees
with
the
insufficient
rations
was
intensified
by
the
arrival
of
a
of
bad
meat
the
stench
permeated
the
yard
and
several
men
were
punished
for
passing
uncomplimentary
remarks
about
the
food
the
situation
was
aggravated
by
an
additional
increase
of
the
task
the
knitters
and
loopers
were
on
the
verge
of
rebellion
twice
within
the
month
had
the
task
been
enlarged
they
sent
to
the
warden
a
request
for
a
reduction
in
reply
came
the
appalling
order
for
a
further
increase
then
a
score
of
men
struck
they
remained
in
the
cells
refusing
to
return
to
the
shop
unless
the
demand
for
better
food
and
less
work
was
complied
with
with
the
aid
of
informers
the
warden
conducted
a
quiet
investigation
one
by
one
the
refractory
prisoners
were
forced
to
submit
by
a
process
of
elimination
the
authorities
sifted
the
situation
and
now
it
is
whispered
about
that
a
decision
has
been
reached
placing
responsibility
for
the
unique
episode
of
a
strike
in
the
prison
an
air
of
mystery
hangs
about
the
guards
repeatedly
i
attempt
to
engage
them
in
conversation
but
the
least
reference
to
the
strike
seals
their
lips
i
wonder
at
the
peculiar
looks
they
regard
me
with
when
unexpectedly
the
cause
is
revealed
iii
it
is
sunday
noon
the
rangeman
pushes
the
dinner
wagon
along
the
tier
i
stand
at
the
door
ready
to
receive
the
meal
the
overseer
glances
at
me
then
motions
to
the
prisoner
the
cart
rolls
past
my
cell
officer
i
call
out
you
missed
me
smell
the
do
you
where
my
dinner
you
get
none
the
odor
of
the
steaming
delicacy
so
keenly
looked
forward
to
every
second
sunday
reaches
my
nostrils
and
sharpens
my
hunger
i
have
eaten
sparingly
all
week
in
expectation
of
the
treat
and
now
i
am
humiliated
and
enraged
by
being
so
unceremoniously
deprived
of
the
rare
dinner
angrily
i
rap
the
cup
across
the
door
again
and
again
i
strike
the
tin
against
it
the
successive
falls
from
bar
to
bar
producing
a
sharp
piercing
clatter
a
guard
hastens
along
stop
that
damn
racket
he
commands
what
the
matter
with
you
i
did
get
dinner
yes

did
i
did
not

retort
pointing
to

rules

the
wall
of
the
cell

an
excerpt
here
from
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
directing
the
warden
to
visit
each
prisoner
every
day
never
mind

interrupts
what

the
warden

four
sundays

have
to
ask
the
boss

tell
him

want
to
see
him
presently
the
overseer
returns
informing
me
in
a
confidential
manner
that
he
has
induced
his
nibs
to
grant
me
an
audience
admitted
to
the
inner
office
i
find
the
warden
at
the
desk
his
face
flushed
with
anger

reported
for
disturbing
the
peace

shouts
at
me
there
is
also
hm
hm
another
charge
against
him
the
deputy
interposes
two
charges
the
warden
continues
disturbing
the
peace
and
making
demands
how
dare
you
demand
he
roars
do
you
know
where
you
are
i
wanted
to
see
you

is
not

question
of
what
you

to
obey
the
rules

the
deputy
retorts
mcpane
the
warden
interposes
i
am
going
to
speak
plainly
to
him
from
this
day
on
he
turns
to
me
you
are
on
for
four
weeks
during
that
time
no
papers
or
books
are
permitted
you
it
will
give
you
leisure
to
think
over
your
behavior
i
have
investigated
your
conduct
in
the
shop
and
i
am
satisfied
it
was
you
who
instigated
the
trouble
there
you
shall
not
have
another
chance
to
incite
the
men
even
if
you
live
as
long
as
your
sentence
but
he
pauses
an
instant
then
adds
threateningly
but
you
may
as
well
understand
it
now
as
later
your
life
is
not
worth
the
trouble
you
give
us
mark
you
well
whatever
the
cost
it
will
be
at
expense
for
the
present
you
remain
in
solitary
where
you
can
not
exert
your
pernicious
influence
officers
remove
him
to
the
chapter
xvii
the
basket
cell
four
weeks
of
pennsylvania
diet
have
reduced
me
almost
to
a
skeleton
a
slice
of
wheat
bread
with
a
cup
of
unsweetened
black
coffee
is
my
sole
meal
with
twice
a
week
dinner
of
vegetable
soup
from
which
every
trace
of
meat
has
been
removed
every
saturday
i
am
conducted
to
the
office
to
be
examined
by
the
physician
and
weighed
the
whole
week
i
look
forward
to
the
brief
respite
from
the
terrible
basket
cell
the
sight
of
the
striped
men
scouring
the
floor
the
friendly
smile
on
a
stealthily
raised
face
as
i
pass
through
the
hall
the
strange
blue
of
the
sky
the
aroma
of
the
april
morning
how
quickly
it
is
all
over
but
the
seven
deep
breaths
i
slowly
inhale
on
the
way
to
the
office
and
the
eager
ten
on
my
return
set
my
blood
aglow
with
renewed
life
for
an
instant
my
brain
reels
with
the
sudden
rush
of
exquisite
intoxication
and
then
i
am
in
the
tomb
again
the
torture
of
the
basket
is
maddening
the
constant
dusk
is
driving
me
blind
almost
no
light
or
air
reaches
me
through
the
close
wire
netting
covering
the
barred
door
the
foul
odor
is
stifling
it
grips
my
throat
with
deathly
hold
the
walls
hem
me
in
daily
they
press
closer
upon
me
till
the
cell
seems
to
contract
and
i
feel
crushed
in
the
coffin
of
stone
from
every
point
the
whitewashed
sides
glare
at
me
unyielding
inexorable
in
confident
assurance
of
their
prey
the
darkness
of
despondency
gathers
day
by
day
the
hand
of
despair
weighs
heavier
at
night
the
screeching
of
a
crow
across
the
river
ominously
voices
the
black
raven
keeping
vigil
in
my
heart
the
windows
in
the
hallway
quake
and
tremble
in
the
furious
wind
bleak
and
desolate
wakes
the
day
another
day
then
another
weak
and
apathetic
i
lie
on
the
bed
ever
further
recedes
the
world
of
the
living
still
day
follows
night
and
life
is
in
the
making
but
i
have
no
part
in
the
pain
and
travail
like
a
spark
from
the
glowing
furnace
flashing
through
the
gloom
and
swallowed
in
the
darkness
i
have
been
cast
upon
the
shores
of
the
forgotten
no
sound
reaches
me
from
the
island
prison
where
beats
the
fervent
heart
of
the
girl
no
ray
of
hope
falls
across
the
bars
of
desolation
but
on
the
threshold
of
nirvana
life
recoils
in
the
very
bowels
of
torment
it
cries
out
persecution
feeds
the
fires
of
defiance
and
nerves
my
resolution
were
i
an
ordinary
prisoner
i
should
not
care
to
suffer
all
these
agonies
to
what
purpose
with
my
impossible
sentence
but
my
anarchist
ideals
and
traditions
rise
in
revolt
against
the
vampire
gloating
over
its
prey
no
i
shall
not
disgrace
the
cause
i
shall
not
grieve
my
comrades
by
weak
surrender
i
will
fight
and
struggle
and
not
be
daunted
by
threat
or
torture
with
difficulty
i
walk
to
the
office
for
the
weekly
weighing
my
step
falters
as
i
approach
the
scales
and
i
sway
dizzily
as
through
a
mist
i
see
the
doctor
bending
over
me
his
head
pressing
against
my
body
somehow
i
reach
the
basket
mildly
wondering
why
i
did
not
feel
the
cold
air
perhaps
they
did
not
take
me
through
the
yard
is
it
the
block
captain
voice
what
did
you
say
return
to
your
old
cell
you
on
full
diet
now
chapter
xviii
the
solitary
i
direct
to
box
a
allegheny
city
march
dear
fedya
this
letter
is
somewhat
delayed
for
certain
reasons
i
missed
last
month
prison
life
too
has
its
ups
and
downs
and
just
now
i
am
on
the
down
side
we
are
cautioned
to
refrain
from
referring
to
local
affairs
therefore
i
can
tell
you
only
that
i
am
in
solitary
without
work
i
do
know
how
long
i
am
to
be
kept
locked
up
it
may
be
a
month
or
a
year
i
hope
it
will
not
be
the
latter
i
was
not
permitted
to
receive
the
magazines
and
delicacies
you
sent
we
may
subscribe
for
the
daily
papers
and
you
can
easily
imagine
how
religiously
i
read
them
from
headline
to
the
last
ad
they
keep
me
in
touch
to
some
extent
with
the
living
blessed
be
the
shades
of
guttenberg
hugo
and
zola
even
gogol
and
turgenev
are
in
the
library
it
is
like
meeting
an
old
friend
in
a
strange
land
to
find
our
own
bazarov
discoursing
in
english
page
after
page
unfolds
the
past
the
solitary
is
forgotten
the
walls
melt
away
and
again
i
roam
with
leather
stocking
in
the
primitive
forest
or
sorrow
with
poor
oliver
twist
but
the
captain
daughter
irritates
me
and
pugatchev
the
rebellious
soul
has
turned
a
caricature
in
the
awkward
hands
of
the
translator
and
now
comes
tarass
bulba
is
it
our
own
tarass
the
fearless
warrior
the
scourge
of
turk
and
tartar
how
grotesque
is
the
brave
old
hetman
storming
maledictions
against
the
hated
moslems
in
german
periods
exasperated
and
offended
i
turn
my
back
upon
the
desecration
and
open
a
book
of
poems
but
instead
of
the
requested
robert
burns
i
find
a
volume
of
wordsworth
posies
bloom
on
his
pages
and
rosebuds
scent
his
rhymes
but
the
pains
of
the
world
labor
wake
no
chord
in
his
soul
science
and
romance
history
and
travel
religion
and
philosophy
all
come
trooping
into
the
cell
in
irrelevant
sequence
for
the
allowance
of
only
one
book
at
a
time
limits
my
choice
the
variety
of
reading
affords
rich
material
for
reflection
and
helps
to
perfect
my
english
but
some
passage
in
the
starry
heavens
suddenly
brings
me
to
earth
and
the
present
is
illumined
with
the
direct
perception
of
despair
and
the
anguished
question
surges
through
my
mind
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
study
and
learning
and
then
but
why
harrow
you
with
this
tenor
i
did
not
mean
to
say
all
this
when
i
began
it
can
not
be
undone
the
sheet
must
be
accounted
for
therefore
it
will
be
mailed
to
you
but
i
know
dear
friend
you
also
are
not
bedded
on
roses
and
the
poor
sailor
my
space
is
all
alex
ii
the
lengthening
chain
of
days
in
the
solitary
drags
its
heavy
links
through
every
change
of
misery
the
cell
is
suffocating
with
the
summer
heat
rarely
does
the
fresh
breeze
from
the
river
steal
a
caress
upon
my
face
on
the
pretext
of
a
draught
the
unfriendly
guard
has
closed
the
hall
windows
opposite
my
cell
not
a
breath
of
air
is
stirring
the
leaden
hours
of
the
night
are
insufferable
with
the
foul
odor
of
the
perspiration
and
excrement
of
a
thousand
bodies
sleepless
i
toss
on
the
withered
mattress
the
ravages
of
time
and
the
weight
of
many
inmates
have
demoralized
it
out
of
all
semblance
of
a
bedtick
but
the
block
captain
persistently
ignores
my
request
for
new
straw
directing
me
to
shake
it
up
a
bit
i
am
fearful
of
repeating
the
experiment
the
clouds
of
dust
almost
strangled
me
for
days
the
cell
remained
hazy
with
the
powdered
filth
impatiently
i
await
the
morning
the
yard
door
will
open
before
the
marching
lines
and
the
fresh
air
be
wafted
past
my
cell
i
shall
stand
ready
to
receive
the
precious
tonic
that
is
to
give
me
life
this
day
and
when
the
block
has
belched
forth
its
striped
prey
and
silence
mounts
its
vigil
i
may
improve
a
favorable
moment
to
exchange
a
greeting
with
johnny
davis
the
young
prisoner
is
in
solitary
on
the
tier
above
me
thrice
his
request
for
a
high
gear
machine
has
been
refused
and
the
tall
youth
forced
to
work
doubled
over
a
low
table
unable
to
exert
his
best
efforts
in
the
cramped
position
johnny
has
repeatedly
been
punished
with
the
dungeon
last
week
he
suffered
a
hemorrhage
all
through
the
night
resounds
his
hollow
cough
desperate
with
the
dread
of
consumption
johnny
has
refused
to
return
to
work
the
warden
relenting
in
a
kindly
mood
permitted
him
to
resume
his
original
high
machine
but
the
boy
has
grown
obdurate
he
is
determined
not
to
go
back
to
the
shop
whose
officer
caused
him
so
much
trouble
the
prison
discipline
takes
no
cognizance
of
the
situation
regularly
every
monday
the
torture
is
repeated
the
youth
is
called
before
the
deputy
and
assigned
to
the
hosiery
department
the
unvarying
refusal
is
followed
by
the
dungeon
and
then
johnny
is
placed
in
the
solitary
to
be
cited
again
before
the
warden
the
ensuing
monday
i
chafe
at
my
helplessness
to
aid
the
boy
his
course
is
suicidal
but
the
least
suggestion
of
yielding
enrages
him
i
die
before
i
give
in
he
told
me
from
whispered
talks
through
the
waste
pipe
i
learn
the
sad
story
of
his
young
life
he
is
nineteen
with
a
sentence
of
five
years
before
him
his
father
a
brakeman
was
killed
in
a
railroad
collision
the
suit
for
damages
was
dragged
through
years
of
litigation
leaving
the
widow
destitute
since
the
age
of
fourteen
young
johnny
had
to
support
the
whole
family
lately
he
was
employed
as
the
driver
of
a
delivery
wagon
associating
with
a
rough
element
that
gradually
drew
him
into
gambling
one
day
a
shortage
of
twelve
dollars
was
discovered
in
the
accounts
the
mills
of
justice
began
to
grind
and
johnny
was
speedily
clad
in
stripes
in
vain
i
strive
to
absorb
myself
in
the
library
book
the
shoddy
heroes
of
laura
jean
wake
no
response
in
my
heart
the
superior
beings
of
corelli
communing
with
mysterious
heavenly
circles
stalk
by
strange
and
unhuman
here
in
the
cell
above
me
cries
and
moans
the
terrible
tragedy
of
reality
what
a
monstrous
thing
it
is
that
the
whole
power
of
the
commonwealth
all
the
machinery
of
government
is
concentrated
to
crush
this
unfortunate
atom
innocently
guilty
too
the
poor
boy
is
ensnared
by
the
gaming
spirit
of
the
time
the
feeble
creature
of
vitiating
environment
his
fate
is
sealed
by
a
moment
of
weakness
yet
his
deviation
from
the
path
of
established
ethics
is
but
a
faint
reflection
of
the
lives
of
the
men
that
decreed
his
doom
the
hypocrisy
of
organized
society
the
very
foundation
of
its
existence
rests
upon
the
negation
and
defiance
of
every
professed
principle
of
right
and
justice
every
feature
of
its
face
is
a
caricature
a
travesty
upon
the
semblance
of
truth
the
whole
life
of
humanity
a
mockery
of
the
very
name
political
mastery
based
on
violence
and
jesuitry
industry
gathering
the
harvest
of
human
blood
commerce
ascendant
on
the
ruins
of
manhood
such
is
the
morality
of
civilization
and
over
the
edifice
of
this
stupendous
perversion
the
law
sits
enthroned
and
religion
weaves
the
spell
of
awe
and
varnishes

johnny
goes
to
church
and
prays
forgiveness
for
his
sins
the
prosecutor
was
very
hard
on
him
he
told
me
the
blind
mole
perceives
only
the
immediate
and
is
embittered
against
the
persons
directly
responsible
for
his
long
imprisonment
but
greater
minds
have
failed
fully
to
grasp
the
iniquity
of
the
established
my
beloved
burns
even
seems
inadequate
powerfully
as
he
moves
my
spirit
with
his
deep
sympathy
for
the
poor
the
oppressed
but
man
inhumanity
to
man
is
not
the
last
word
the
truth
lies
deeper
it
is
economic
slavery
the
savage
struggle
for
a
crumb
that
has
converted
mankind
into
wolves
and
sheep
in
liberty
and
communism
none
would
have
the
will
or
the
power
to
make
countless
thousands
mourn
verily
it
is
the
system
rather
than
individuals
that
is
the
source
of
pollution
and
degradation
my
environment
is
but
another
manifestation
of
the
whose
cursed
touch
turns
everything
to
the
brutal
service
of
mammon
dullness
fawns
upon
cruelty
for
advancement
with
savage
joy
the
shop
foreman
cracks
his
whip
for
his
meed
of
the
blood
the
famished
bodies
in
stripes
the
agonized
brains
reeling
in
the
dungeon
night
the
men
buried
in
basket
and
solitary
what
human
hand
would
turn
the
key
upon
a
soul
in
utter
darkness
but
for
the
dread
of
a
like
fate
and
the
shadow
it
casts
before
this
nightmare
is
but
an
intensified
replica
of
the
world
beyond
the
larger
prison
locked
with
the
levers
of
greed
guarded
by
the
spawn
of
hunger
my
mind
reverts
insistently
to
the
life
outside
it
is
a
herculean
task
to
rouse
apathy
to
the
sordidness
of
its
misery
yet
if
the
people
would
but
realize
the
depths
of
their
degradation
and
be
informed
of
the
means
of
deliverance
how
joyously
they
would
embrace
anarchy
quick
and
decisive
would
be
the
victory
of
the
workers
against
the
handful
of
their
despoilers
an
hour
of
sanity
freed
from
prejudice
and
superstition
and
the
torch
of
liberty
would
flame
the
world
and
the
banner
of
equality
and
brotherhood
be
planted
upon
the
hills
of
a
regenerated
humanity
ah
if
the
world
would
but
pause
for
one
short
while
and
understand
and
become
free
involuntarily
i
am
reminded
of
the
old
rabbinical
lore
only
one
instant
of
righteousness
and
messiah
would
come
upon
earth
the
beautiful
promise
had
strongly
appealed
to
me
in
the
days
of
childhood
the
merciful
god
requires
so
little
of
us
i
had
often
pondered
why
will
we
not
abstain
from
sin
and
evil
for
just
the
twinkling
of
an
for
weeks
i
went
about
weighed
down
with
the
grief
of
impenitent
israel
refusing
to
be
saved
my
eager
brain
pregnant
with
projects
of
hastening
the
deliverance
like
a
divine
inspiration
came
the
solution
at
the
stroke
of
the
noon
hour
on
a
preconcerted
day
all
the
men
and
women
of
the
jewry
throughout
the
world
should
bow
in
prayer
for
a
single
stroke
of
time
all
at
once
behold
the
messiah
come
in
agonizing
perplexity
i
gazed
at
my
hebrew
tutor
shaking
his
head
how
his
kindly
smile
quivered
dismay
into
my
thrilling
heart
the
children
of
israel
could
not
be
saved
thus
he
spoke
sadly
nay
not
even
in
the
most
circumspect
manner
affording
our
people
in
the
farthest
corners
of
the
earth
time
to
prepare
for
the
solemn
moment
the
messiah
will
come
the
good
tutor
kindly
consoled
me
it
had
been
promised
but
the
hour
hath
not
arrived
he
quoted
no
man
hath
the
power
to
hasten
the
steps
of
the
deliverer
with
a
sense
of
sobering
sadness
i
think
of
the
new
hope
the
revolutionary
messiah
truly
the
old
rabbi
was
wise
beyond
his
ken
it
hath
been
given
to
no
man
to
hasten
the
march
of
delivery
out
of
the
people
need
from
the
womb
of
their
suffering
must
be
born
the
hour
of
redemption
necessity
necessity
alone
with
its
iron
heel
will
spur
numb
misery
to
effort
and
waken
the
living
dead
the
process
is
tortuously
slow
but
the
gestation
of
a
new
humanity
can
not
be
hurried
by
impatience
we
must
bide
our
time
meanwhile
preparing
the
workers
for
the
great
upheaval
the
errors
of
the
past
are
to
be
guarded
against
always
has
apparent
victory
been
divested
of
its
fruits
and
paralyzed
into
defeat
because
the
people
were
fettered
by
their
respect
for
property
by
the
superstitious
awe
of
authority
and
by
reliance
upon
leaders
these
ghosts
must
be
cast
out
and
the
torch
of
reason
lighted
in
the
darkness
of
men
minds
ere
blind
rebellion
can
rend
the
midway
clouds
of
defeat
and
sight
the
glory
of
the
social
revolution
and
the
beyond
iii
a
heavy
nightmare
oppresses
my
sleep
confused
sounds
ring
in
my
ears
and
beat
upon
my
head
i
wake
in
nameless
dread
the
is
raging
with
uproar
crash
after
crash
booms
through
the
hall
it
thunders
against
the
walls
of
the
cell
then
rolls
like
some
monstrous
drum
along
the
galleries
and
abruptly
ceases
in
terror
i
cower
on
the
bed
all
is
deathly
still
timidly
i
look
around
the
cell
is
in
darkness
and
only
a
faint
gas
light
flickers
unsteadily
in
the
corridor
suddenly
a
cry
cuts
the
silence
shrill
and
unearthly
bursting
into
wild
laughter
and
again
the
fearful
thunder
now
bellowing
from
the
cell
above
now
muttering
menacingly
in
the
distance
then
dying
with
a
growl
and
all
is
hushed
again
and
only
the
unearthly
laughter
rings
through
the
hall
johnny
johnny

call
in

johnny
th

look
out
now
they
comin
the
heavy
doors
of
the
rotunda
groan
on
their
hinges
shadowlike
giant
figures
glide
past
my
cell
they
walk
inaudibly
and
portentous
the
long
riot
clubs
rigid
at
their
sides
behind
them
others
and
then
the
warden
a
large
revolver
gleaming
in
his
hand
with
bated
breath
i
listen
conscious
of
the
presence
of
other
men
at
the
doors
suddenly
wailing
and
wild
laughter
pierce
the
night
there
is
the
rattling
of
iron
violent
scuffling
the
sickening
thud
of
a
falling
body
and
all
is
quiet
noiselessly
the
bread
cart
flits
by
the
huge
shadows
bending
over
the
body
stretched
on
the
boards
the
gong
booms
the
rising
hour
the
morning
sun
glints
a
ray
upon
the
bloody
trail
in
the
hall
and
hides
behind
the
gathering
mist
a
squad
of
men
in
gray
and
black
is
marched
from
the
yard
they
kneel
on
the
floor
and
with
sand
and
water
scour
the
crimson
flagstones
with
great
relief
i
learn
that
crazy
smithy
is
not
dead
he
will
recover
the
rangeman
assures
me
the
doctor
bandaged
the
man
wounds
and
then
the
prisoner
still
unconscious
was
dragged
to
the
dungeon
little
by
little
i
glean
his
story
from
my
informant
smith
has
been
insane
at
times
violently
ever
since
his
imprisonment
about
four
years
ago
his
partner
burns
has
also
become
deranged
through
worry
over
his
sentence
of
years
his
madness
assumed
such
revolting
expression
that
the
authorities
caused
his
commitment
to
the
insane
asylum
but
smith
remains
on
crank
row
the
warden
insisting
that
he
is
shamming
to
gain
an
opportunity
to
escape
iv
the
rare
snatches
of
conversation
with
the
old
rangeman
are
events
in
the
monotony
of
the
solitary
owing
to
the
illness
of
bob
communication
with
my
friends
is
almost
entirely
suspended
in
the
forced
idleness
the
hours
grow
heavy
and
languid
the
days
drag
in
unvarying
sameness
by
violent
efforts
of
will
i
strangle
the
recurring
thought
of
my
long
sentence
and
seek
forgetfulness
in
reading
volume
after
volume
passes
through
my
hands
till
my
brain
is
steeped
with
the
printed
word
page
by
page
i
recite
the
history
of
the
holy
church
the
lives
of
the
fathers
and
the
saints
or
read
aloud
to
hear
a
human
voice
the
mythology
of
greece
and
india
mingling
with
it
for
the
sake
of
variety
a
few
chapters
from
mill
and
spencer
but
in
the
midst
of
an
intricate
passage
in
the
unknowable
or
in
the
heart
of
a
difficult
mathematical
problem
i
suddenly
become
aware
of
my
pencil
drawing
familiar
figures
on
the
library
slate
what
is
this
i
wonder
and
immediately
i
proceed
in
semiconscious
manner
to
finish
the
calculation
days
hours
minutes
seconds
but
the
next
moment
i
am
aghast
at
the
realization
that
my
computation
allows
only
days
per
month
whereas
the
year
consists
of
sometimes
even
of
days
and
again
i
repeat
the
process
multiplying
by
and
am
startled
to
find
that
i
have
almost
seconds
to
pass
in
the
solitary
from
the
official
calendar
alongside
of
the
rules
the
cheering
promise
faces
me
good
conduct
shortens
time
but
i
have
been
repeatedly
reported
and
punished
they
will
surely
deprive
me
of
the
commutation
with
great
care
i
figure
out
my
allowance
one
month
on
the
first
year
one
on
the
second
two
on
the
third
and
fourth
three
on
the
fifth
sixth
seventh
eighth
and
ninth
four
good
time
on
each
succeeding
year
i
shall
therefore
have
to
serve
fifteen
years
and
three
months
in
this
place
and
then
eleven
months
in
the
workhouse
i
have
been
here
now
two
years
it
still
leaves
me
years
and
months
or
more
than
days
appalled
by
the
figures
i
pace
the
cell
in
agitation
it
is
hopeless
it
is
folly
to
expect
to
survive
such
a
sentence
especially
in
view
of
the
warden
persecution
and
the
petty
tyranny
of
the
keepers
thoughts
of
suicide
and
escape
wild
fancies
of
unforeseen
developments
in
the
world
at
large
that
will
somehow
result
in
my
liberation
all
struggle
in
confusion
leaving
me
faint
and
miserable
my
absolute
isolation
holds
no
promise
of
deliverance
the
days
of
illness
and
suffering
fill
me
with
anguish
with
a
sharp
pang
i
observe
the
thinning
of
my
hair
the
evidence
of
physical
decay
rouses
the
fear
of
mental
collapse
insanity
i
shudder
at
the
terrible
suggestion
and
lash
myself
into
a
fever
of
irritation
with
myself
the
rangeman
and
every
passing
convict
my
heart
seething
with
hatred
of
the
warden
the
guards
the
judge
and
that
unembodied
shapeless
but
inexorable
and
merciless
thing
the
world
in
the
moments
of
reacting
calm
i
apply
myself
to
philosophy
and
science
determinedly
with
the
desperation
born
of
horror
but
the
dread
ghost
is
ever
before
me
it
follows
me
up
and
down
the
cell
mocks
me
with
the
wild
laughter
of
crazy
smith
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
with
the
moaning
and
waking
of
my
neighbor
suddenly
gone
mad
chapter
xix
often
the
chaplain
pauses
at
my
door
and
speaks
words
of
encouragement
i
feel
deeply
moved
by
his
sympathy
but
my
revolutionary
traditions
forbid
the
expression
of
my
emotions
a
cog
in
the
machinery
of
oppression
he
might
mistake
my
gratitude
for
the
obsequiousness
of
the
fawning
convict
but
i
hope
he
feels
my
appreciation
in
the
simple
thank
you
it
is
kind
of
him
to
lend
me
books
from
his
private
library
and
occasionally
also
permit
me
an
extra
sheet
of
writing
paper
correspondence
with
the
girl
and
the
twin
and
the
unfrequent
exchange
of
notes
with
my
comrades
are
the
only
links
that
still
bind
me
to
the
living
i
feel
weary
and
indifferent
to
the
trivial
incidents
of
existence
that
seem
to
hold
such
exciting
interest
for
the
other
inmates
old
sammy
the
rangeman
grown
nervous
with
the
approach
of
liberty
inverts
a
hundred
opportunities
to
unburden
his
heart
all
day
long
he
limps
from
cell
to
cell
pretending
to
scrub
the
doorsills
or
dust
the
bars
meanwhile
chattering
volubly
to
the
solitaries
listlessly
i
suffer
the
recital
of
the
news
elaborately
discussed
and
commented
upon
with
impassioned
earnestness
he
interrupts
his
anathemas
upon
the
rotten
food
and
the
thieving
murderers
to
launch
into
enthusiastic
details
of
the
meal
he
will
enjoy
on
the
day
of
release
the
imprisoned
friends
he
will
remember
with
towels
and
handkerchiefs
but
he
grows
pensive
at
the
mention
of
the
folks
at
home
the
old
woman
died
of
a
broken
heart
the
boys
have
not
written
a
line
in
three
years
he
fears
they
have
sold
the
little
farmhouse
and
flown
to
the
city
but
the
joy
of
coming
freedom
drives
away
the
sad
thought
and
he
mumbles
hopefully
i
see
i
see
and
rejoices
in
being
alive
and
still
good
for
a
while
and
then
abruptly
changes
the
conversation
and
relates
minutely
how
that
poor
crazy
dick
was
yesterday
found
hanging
in
the
cell
and
he
the
first
to
discover
him
and
to
help
the
guards
cut
him
down
and
last
week
he
was
present
when
the
physician
tried
to
revive
the
little
dago
and
if
the
doctor
had
only
returned
quicker
from
the
theatre
poor
joe
might
have
been
saved
he
took
a
fit
and
the
screws
jest
let
lay
for
the
doc
they
says
hope
they
do
kill
yet
he
comments
hobbling
away
the
presence
of
death
daunts
the
thought
of
ever
stronger
asserts
itself
the
love
of
life
the
will
to
be
roots
deeper
but
the
hope
of
escape
recedes
with
the
ebbing
of
my
vitality
the
constant
harassing
has
forced
the
discontinuation
of
the
the
eccentric
warden
seems
to
have
conceived
a
great
fear
of
an
anarchist
conspiracy
special
orders
have
been
issued
placing
the
trio
under
extraordinary
surveillance
suspecting
our
clandestine
correspondence
yet
unable
to
trace
it
the
authorities
have
decided
to
separate
us
in
a
manner
excluding
all
possibility
of
communication
apparently
i
am
to
be
continued
in
the
solitary
indefinitely
while
nold
is
located
in
the
south
wing
and
bauer
removed
to
the
furthest
cell
on
an
upper
gallery
in
the
north
block
the
precious
magazine
is
suspended
and
only
the
daring
of
the
faithful
horsethief
enables
us
to
exchange
an
occasional
note
amid
the
fantastic
shapes
cast
by
the
dim
candle
light
i
pass
the
long
winter
evenings
the
prison
day
between
and
i
divide
into
three
parts
devoting
four
hours
each
to
exercise
english
and
reading
the
remaining
two
hours
occupied
with
meals
and
cleaning
up
surrounded
by
grammars
and
dictionaries
borrowed
from
the
chaplain
i
absorb
myself
in
a
sentence
of
shakespeare
dissecting
each
word
studying
origin
and
derivation
analyzing
prefix
and
suffix
i
find
moments
of
exquisite
pleasure
in
tracing
some
simple
expression
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
its
existence
to
its
latin
or
greek
source
in
the
history
of
the
corresponding
epoch
i
seek
the
people
joys
and
tragedies
contemporary
with
the
fortunes
of
the
word
philology
with
the
background
of
history
leads
me
into
the
pastures
of
mythology
and
comparative
religion
through
the
mazes
of
metaphysics
and
warring
philosophies
to
rationalism
and
evolutionary
science
oblivious
of
my
environment
i
walk
with
the
disciples
of
socrates
flee
athens
with
the
persecuted
diagoras
the
atheist
and
listen
in
ecstasy
to
the
lute
of
arion
or
with
suetonius
i
pass
in
review
the
twelve
caesars
and
weep
with
the
hostages
swelling
the
triumph
of
the
eternal
city
but
on
the
very
threshold
of
boudoir
about
to
enter
with
the
intrepid
mark
antony
i
am
met
by
three
giant
slaves
with
the
command
a
hands
up
step
out
to
be
searched
for
days
my
enfeebled
nerves
quiver
with
the
shock
with
difficulty
i
force
myself
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
my
life
amid
the
spirits
of
the
past
the
placid
waters
have
been
disturbed
and
all
the
miasma
of
the
quagmire
seethes
toward
the
surface
and
fills
my
cup
with
the
bitterness
of
death
the
release
of
old
sammy
stirs
me
to
the
very
depths
many
prisoners
have
come
and
gone
during
my
stay
with
some
i
merely
touched
hands
as
they
passed
in
the
darkness
and
disappeared
leaving
no
trace
in
my
existence
but
the
old
rangeman
with
his
smiling
eyes
and
fervid
optimism
has
grown
dear
to
me
he
shared
with
me
his
hopes
and
fears
divided
his
extra
slice
of
cornbread
and
strove
to
cheer
me
in
his
own
homely
manner
i
miss
his
genial
presence
something
has
gone
out
of
my
life
with
him
leaving
a
void
saddening
gnawing
in
thought
i
follow
my
friend
through
the
gates
of
the
prison
out
into
the
free
the
alluring
outside
the
charmed
circle
that
holds
the
promise
of
life
and
joy
and
liberty
like
a
horrible
nightmare
the
sombre
walls
fade
away
and
only
a
dark
shadow
vibrates
in
my
memory
like
a
hidden
menace
faint
yet
and
terrible
the
sun
glows
brilliant
in
the
heavens
wavelets
float
upon
the
azure
and
sweet
odors
are
everywhere
about
me
all
the
longing
of
my
soul
wells
up
with
violent
passion
and
in
a
sudden
transport
of
joy
i
fling
myself
upon
the
earth
and
weep
and
kiss
it
in
prayerful
bliss
the
candle
sputters
hisses
and
dies
i
sit
in
the
dark
silently
lifts
the
veil
of
time
the
little
new
york
flat
rises
before
me
the
girl
is
returning
home
the
roses
of
youth
grown
pallid
amid
the
shadows
of
death
only
her
eyes
glow
firmer
and
deeper
a
look
of
challenge
in
her
saddened
face
as
on
an
open
page
i
read
the
suffering
of
her
prison
experience
the
sharper
lines
of
steadfast
purpose
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
our
mutual
past
unfold
before
me
and
again
i
live
in
the
old
surroundings
the
memorable
scene
of
our
first
meeting
in
the
little
café
at
sachs
projects
clearly
the
room
is
chilly
in
the
november
dusk
as
i
return
from
work
and
secure
my
accustomed
place
one
by
one
the
old
habitués
drop
in
and
presently
i
am
in
a
heated
discussion
with
two
russian
refugees
at
the
table
opposite
the
door
opens
and
a
young
woman
enters
with
the
ruddy
vigor
of
youth
she
diffuses
an
atmosphere
of
strength
and
vitality
i
wonder
who
the
newcomer
may
be
two
years
in
the
movement
have
familiarized
me
with
the
personnel
of
the
revolutionary
circles
of
the
metropolis
this
girl
is
evidently
a
stranger
i
am
quite
sure
i
have
never
met
her
at
our
gatherings
i
motion
to
the
passing
proprietor
he
smiles
anticipating
my
question
you
want
to
know
who
the
young
lady
is
he
whispers
i
see
see
somehow
i
find
myself
at
her
table
without
constraint
we
soon
converse
like
old
acquaintances
and
i
learn
that
she
left
her
home
in
rochester
to
escape
the
stifling
provincial
atmosphere
she
is
a
dressmaker
and
hopes
to
find
work
in
new
york
i
like
her
simple
frank
confidence
the
comrade
on
her
lips
thrills
me
she
is
one
of
us
then
with
a
sense
of
pride
in
the
movement
i
enlarge
upon
the
activities
of
our
circle
there
are
important
meetings
she
ought
to
attend
many
people
to
meet
hasselmann
is
conducting
a
course
in
sociology
schultze
is
giving
splendid
lectures
have
you
heard
most
i
ask
suddenly
no
you
must
hear
our
grand
old
man
he
speaks
will
you
come
with
me
eagerly
i
look
forward
to
the
next
evening
and
hasten
to
the
café
it
is
frosty
outdoors
as
i
walk
the
narrow
dark
streets
in
animated
discussion
with
comrade
rochester
the
ancient
sidewalks
are
uneven
and
cracked
in
spots
crusted
with
filth
as
we
cross
delancey
street
the
girl
slips
and
almost
falls
when
i
catch
her
in
my
arms
just
in
time
to
prevent
her
head
striking
the
curbstone
you
have
saved
my
life
she
smiles
at
me
her
eyes
dancing
vivaciously
with
great
pride
i
introduce
my
new
friend
to
the
of
the
ghetto
among
the
exiles
of
the
colony
ah
the
exaltation
the
joy
of
being
the
whole
history
of
revolutionary
russia
is
mirrored
in
our
circles
every
shade
of
temperamental
nihilism
and
political
view
is
harbored
there
i
see

surrounded
by
the
halo
of
conspirative
mystery

some

master
hand
of
a

turgenev
often
the
solitary
hours
are
illumined
by
scenes
of
the
past
with
infinite
detail
i
live
again
through
the
years
of
the
inspiring
friendship
that
held
the
girl
the
twin
and
myself
in
the
closest
bonds
of
revolutionary
aspiration
and
personal
intimacy
how
full
of
interest
and
rich
promise
was
life
in
those
days
so
far
away
when
after
the
hours
of
humiliating
drudgery
in
the
factory
i
would
hasten
to
the
little
room
in
suffolk
street
small
and
narrow
with
its
diminutive
table
and
solitary
chair
the
bedroom
would
be
transfigured
into
the
sanctified
chamber
of
fate
holding
the
balance
of
the
weal
only
two
could
sit
on
the
little
cot
the
third
on
the
rickety
chair
and
if
somebody
else
called
we
would
stand
around
the
room
filling
the
air
with
the
glowing
hope
of
our
young
hearts
in
the
firm
consciousness
that
we
were
hastening
the
steps
of
progress
advancing
the
glorious
dawn
the
memory
of
the
life
outside
intensifies
the
misery
of
the
solitary
i
brood
over
the
uselessness
of
my
suffering
my
mission
in
life
terminated
with
the
what
good
can
my
continued
survival
do
my
propagandistic
value
as
a
living
example
of
class
injustice
and
political
persecution
is
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
impose
upon
me
the
duty
of
existence
and
even
if
it
were
the
almost
three
years
of
my
imprisonment
have
served
the
purpose
escape
is
out
of
consideration
so
long
as
i
remain
constantly
under
lock
and
key
the
subject
of
special
surveillance
communication
with
nold
and
bauer
too
is
daily
growing
more
difficult
my
health
is
fast
failing
i
am
barely
able
to
walk
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
misery
and
torture
what
is
the
use
in
such
moments
i
stand
on
the
brink
of
eternity
is
it
sheer
apathy
and
languor
that
hold
the
weak
thread
of
life
or
nature
law
and
the
inherent
spirit
of
resistance
were
i
not
in
the
enemy
power
i
should
unhesitatingly
cross
the
barrier
but
as
a
pioneer
of
the
cause
i
must
live
and
struggle
yet
life
without
activity
or
interest
is
terrifying
i
long
for
sympathy
and
affection
with
an
aching
heart
i
remember
my
comrades
and
friends
and
the
girl
more
and
more
my
mind
dwells
upon
tender
memories
i
wake
at
night
with
a
passionate
desire
for
the
sight
of
a
sweet
face
the
touch
of
a
soft
hand
a
wild
yearning
fills
me
for
the
women
i
have
known
as
they
pass
in
my
mind
eye
from
the
time
of
my
early
youth
to
the
last
kiss
of
feminine
lips
with
a
thrill
i
recall
each
bright
look
and
tender
accent
my
heart
beats
tumultuously
as
i
meet
little
nadya
on
the
way
to
school
pretending
i
do
not
see
her
i
turn
around
to
admire
the
golden
locks
floating
in
the
breeze
when
i
surprise
her
stealthily
watching
me
i
adore
her
secretly
but
proudly
decline
my
chum
offer
to
introduce
me
how
foolish
of
me
but
i
know
no
timid
shrinking
as
i
wait
on
a
cold
winter
evening
for
our
neighbor
servant
girl
to
cross
the
yard
and
how
unceremoniously
i
embrace
her
she
is
not
a
i
need
not
mask
my
feelings
and
she
is
so
primitive
she
accuses
me
of
knowing
things
not
fit
for
a
boy
of
my
age
but
she
kisses
me
again
and
passion
wakes
at
the
caress
of
the
large
coarse
hand
my
eldridge
street
platonic
sweetheart
stands
before
me
and
i
tingle
with
every
sensual
emotion
of
my
first
years
in
new
york
out
of
the
new
haven
days
rises
the
image
of
luba
sweeping
me
with
unutterable
longing
for
the
unattained
and
again
i
live
through
the
experiences
of
the
past
passionately
visualizing
every
detail
with
images
that
flatter
my
erotic
palate
and
weave
exquisite
allurement
about
the
urge
of
sex

good
news
i
was

home
yesterday
and
i
was
put
in
his
place

lucky
the
old
deputy
died
he
was
determined
to
keep
me
in
solitary
in
the
absence
of
the
warden
benny
greaves
the
new
deputy
told
me
he
will
risk
giving
me
a
job
but
he
has
issued
strict
orders
i
should
not
be
permitted
to
step
into
the
yard
i
therefore
still
be
under
special
surveillance
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
you
but
i
am
in
touch
with
our
faithful
and
we
can
now
resume
a
more
regular
correspondence
over
a
year
in
solitary
it
almost
like
liberty
to
be
out
of
the
cell
ii
my
position
as
affords
many
opportunities
for
closer
contact
with
the
prisoners
i
assist
the
rangeman
in
taking
care
of
a
row
of
cells
situated
on
the
ground
floor
and
lettered
above
it
are
successively

they
permit
easy
access
to
the
several

with
a
total
of

my
various
duties
of
sweeping
the
hall
dusting
the
cell
doors
and
assisting
at
feeding
enable
me
to
become
acquainted
and
to
form
friendships
i
marvel
at
the
inadequacy
of
my
previous
notions
of
the
criminal
i
resent
the
presumption
of
science
that
pretends
to
evolve
the
intricate
convolutions
of

he
relates
to
me
but
he
could
afford

he
earned
only
seven
dollars
per
week
as
butcher
boy
he
always
gave
his
mother
every
penny

made
but
the

because

and
there
is
young
rush
the
descendant
of
the
celebrated
family
of
the
great
american
physician
the
delicate
features
radiant
with
spirituality
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
shelley
the
limping
gait
recalls
the
tragedy
of
byron
he
is
in
for
murder
he
sits
at
the
door
an
open
book
in
his
hands
the
page
is
moist
with
the
tears
silently
trickling
down
his
face
he
smiles
at
my
approach
and
his
expressive
eyes
light
up
the
darkened
cell
like
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
breaking
through
the
clouds
he
was
wooing
a
girl
on
a
summer
night
the
skiff
suddenly
upturned
right
opposite
here
he
points
to
the
river
near
mckees
rocks
he
was
dragged
out
unconscious
they
told
him
the
girl
was
dead
and
that
he
was
her
murderer
he
reaches
for
the
photograph
on
his
table
and
bursts
into
sobs
daily
i
sweep
the
length
of
the
hall
advancing
from
cell
to
cell
with
deliberate
stroke
all
the
while
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
exchange
a
greeting
with
the
prisoners
my
mind
reverts
to
poor
wingie
how
he
cheered
me
in
the
first
days
of
misery
how
kind
he
was
in
gentler
tones
i
speak
to
the
unfortunates
and
encourage
the
new
arrivals
or
indulge
some
demented
prisoner
in
a
harmless
whim
the
dry
sweeping
of
the
hallway
raises
a
cloud
of
dust
and
loud
coughing
follows
in
my
wake
taking
advantage
of
the
old
block
captain
cold
in
the
head
i
cautiously
hint
at
the
danger
of
germs
lurking
in
the
atmosphere
a
little
wet
sawdust
on
the
floor
mitchell
and
you
would
catch
colds
so
often
a
capital
idea
he
thinks
and
thereafter
i
guard
the
precious
supply
under
the
bed
in
my
cell
in
little
ways
i
seek
to
help
the
men
in
solitary
every
trifle
means
so
much
long
joe
the
rangeman
whose
duty
it
is
to
attend
to
their
needs
is
engrossed
with
his
own
troubles
the
poor
fellow
is
serving
years
and
he
is
much
worried
by
wild
bill
and
bighead
wilson
they
are
constantly
demanding
to
see
the
warden
it
is
remarkable
that
they
are
never
refused
the
guards
seem
to
stand
in
fear
of
them
wild
bill
is
a
invert
and
there
are
peculiar
rumors
concerning
his
intimacy
with
the
warden
recently
bill
complained
of
indigestion
and
a
guard
sent
me
to
deliver
some
delicacies
to
him
from
the
warden
table
he
remarked
with
a
sly
wink
and
wilson
is
jocularly
referred
to
as
the
deputy
even
by
the
officers
he
is
still
in
stripes
but
he
seems
to
wield
some
powerful
influence
over
the
new
deputy
he
openly
defies
the
rules
upbraids
the
guards
and
issues
orders
he
is
the
warden
runner
clad
with
the
authority
of
his
master
the
prisoners
regard
bill
and
wilson
as
stools
and
cordially
hate
them
but
none
dare
offend
them
poor
joe
is
constantly
harassed
by
deputy
wilson
there
seems
to
be
bitter
enmity
between
the
two
on
account
of
a
young
prisoner
who
prefers
the
friendship
of
joe
worried

like
a
horse
rosette
it
the
old
man
favorite
expression
in
his
rich
vocabulary
of
picturesque
metaphor
and
simile
but
there
is
no
sting
in
the
brusque
speech
no
rancor
in
the
scowling
eyes
on
the
way
to
the
desk
he
pauses
to
whisper
to
the
block
trusty
john
you

run
down
to
the
dispensary
an
get
that
big
stiff
some
cramp
mixture
happening
to
glance
into
a
cell
mitchell
notices
a
new
arrival
a
man
his
back
against
the
door
reading
hey
you
the
block
captain
shouts
at
him
startling
the
green
prisoner
off
his
chair
take
that
bald
thing
out
of
there
or
i
run
you
in
for
indecent
exposure
he
chuckles
at
the
man
fright
like
a
boy
pleased
with
a
naughty
prank
and
ascends
the
upper
tiers
duster
in
hand
i
walk
along
the
range
the
guards
are
engaged
on
the
galleries
examining
cells
overseeing
the
moving
of
the
inmates
to
the
south
wing
or
chatting
with
the
trusties
the
chairs
at
the
officers
desk
are
vacant
keeping
alert
watch
on
the
rotunda
doors
i
walk
from
cell
to
cell
whiling
away
the
afternoon
hours
in
conversation
johnny
the
friendly
runner
loiters
at
the
desk
now
and
then
glancing
into
the
yard
and
giving
me
the
office
by
sharply
snapping
his
fingers
to
warn
me
of
danger
i
ply
the
duster
diligently
while
the
deputy
and
his
assistants
linger
about
surrounded
by
the
trusties
imparting
information
gathered
during
the
day
gradually
they
disperse
called
into
a
shop
where
a
fight
is
in
progress
or
nosing
about
the
kitchen
and
assiduously
killing
time
the
coast
is
clear
and
i
return
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
interrupted
conversation
but
the
subjects
of
common
interest
are
soon
exhausted
the
tirade
against
the
rotten
grub
the
stale
punk
and
the
hogwash
vehement
cursing
of
the
brutal
screws
the
of
a
warden
and
the
unreliability
of
his
promises
the
exchange
of
gossip
and
then
back
again
to
berating
the
food
and
the
treatment
within
the
narrow
circle
runs
the
interminable
tale
colored
by
individual
temperament
intensified
by
the
length
of
sentence
the
whole
is
dominated
by
a
deep
sense
of
unmerited
suffering
and
bitter
resentment
often
breathing
dire
vengeance
against
those
whom
they
consider
responsible
for
their
misfortune
including
the
police
the
prosecutor
the
informer
the
witnesses
and
in
rare
instances
the
trial
judge
but
as
the
release
approaches
the
note
of
hope
and
liberty
rings
clearer
stronger
with
the
swelling
undercurrent
of
frank
and
irrepressible
sex
desire
chapter
xxi
the
deeds
of
the
good
to
the
evil
the
new
arrivals
are
forlorn
and
dejected
a
look
of
fear
and
despair
in
their
eyes
the
among
them
seem
dazed
as
if
with
some
terrible
shock

fall
upon
the

in

the

from

in
their
teens
weep
and
moan
and
tremble
at
the
officer
footstep
only
the
repeaters
and
preserve
their
composure
scoff
at
the
fresh
fish
nod
at
old
acquaintances
and
exchange
vulgar
pleasantries
with
the
guards
but
all
soon
grow
nervous
and
irritable
and
stand
at
the
door
leaning
against
the
bars
an
expression
of
bewildered
hopelessness
or
anxious
expectancy
on
their
faces
they
yearn
for
companionship
and
are
pathetically
eager
to
talk
to
hear
the
sound
of
a
voice
to
unbosom
their
heavy
hearts
i
am
minutely
familiar
with
every
detail
of
their
case
their
their
hopes
and
fears
through
the
endless
weeks
and
months
on
the
range
their
tragedies
are
the
sole
subject
of
conversation
a
glance
into
the
mournful
faces
pressed
close
against
the
bars
and
the
panorama
of
misery
rises
before
me
the
grows
more
desolate
bleaker
the
air
gloomier
and
more
depressing
there
is
joe
zappe
his
bright
eyes
lighting
up
with
a
faint
smile
as
i
pause
at
his
door
hello

he
greets
me
in
his
sweet
sad
voice
he
knows
me
from
the
jail

father
and
elder
brother

been
executed
and
he
commuted
to
life
because
of
youth

is
barely
eighteen
but
his
hair
has
turned
white
he
has
been
acting
queerly
of

at
night
i

muttering

and
i
hastily
leave
the
melancholy
figures
line
the
doors
as
i
walk
up
and
down
the
hall
the
blanched
faces
peer
wistfully
through
the
bars
or
lean
dejectedly
against
the
wall
a
vacant
stare
in
the
dim
eyes
each
calls
to
mind
the
stories
of
misery
and
distress
the
scenes
of
brutality
and
torture
i
witness
in
the
prison
house
like
ghastly
nightmares
the
shadows
pass
before
me
there
is
silent
nick
restlessly
pacing
his
cage
never
ceasing
his
lips
sealed
in
brutish
muteness
for
three
years
he
has
not
left
the
cell
nor
uttered
a
word
the
stolid
features
are
cut
and
bleeding
last
night
he
had
attempted
suicide
and
the
guards
beat
him
and
left
him
unconscious
on
the
floor
there
is
crazy
hunkie
the
austrian
every
morning
as
the
officer
unlocks
his
door
to
hand
in
the
loaf
of
bread
he
makes
a
wild
dash
for
the
yard
shouting
me
wife
where
me
wife
he
rushes
toward
the
front
and
desperately
grabs
the
door
handle
the
double
iron
gate
is
securely
locked
a
look
of
blank
amazement
on
his
face
he
slowly
returns
to
the
cell
the
guards
await
him
with
malicious
smile
suddenly
they
rush
upon
him
blackjacks
in
hand
me
wife

her
the
austrian

the
blood
gushing
from

they
had
been

for
snatching

maltreated
and

they
sought

they

in

on
the
floor
it
is
lancaster
number
he
was
serving
seven
years
and
working
every
day
in
the
mat
shop
slowly
the
days
passed
and
at
last
the
hour
of
release
arrived
but
lancaster
was
not
discharged
he
was
kept
at
his
task
the
warden
informing
him
that
he
had
lost
six
months
of
his
good
time
for
defective
work
the
light
hearted
negro
grew
sullen
and
morose
often
the
silence
of
the
was
pierced
by
his
anguished
cry
in
the
night
my
time
up
time
up
i
want
to
go
home
the
guards
would
take
him
from
the
cell
and
place
him
in
the
dungeon
one
morning
in
a
fit
of
frenzy
he
attacked
captain
mcvey
the
officer
of
the
shop
the
captain
received
a
slight
scratch
on
the
neck
and
lancaster
was
kept
chained
to
the
wall
of
the
dungeon
for
ten
days
he
returned
to
the
cell
a
driveling
imbecile
the
next
day
they
dressed
him
in
his
citizen
clothes
lancaster
mumbling
going
home
going
home
the
warden
and
several
officers
accompanied
him
to
court
on
the
way
coaching
the
poor
idiot
to
answer
yes
to
the
question
do
you
plead
guilty
he
received
seven
years
the
extreme
penalty
of
the
law
for
the
attempted
murder
of
a
keeper
they
brought
him
back
to
the
prison
and
locked
him
up
in
a
basket
cell
the
barred
door
covered
with
a
wire
screen
that
almost
entirely
excludes
light
and
air
he
receives
no
medical
attention
and
is
fed
on
a
diet
the
witless
negro
crawls
on
the
floor
unwashed
and
unkempt
scratching
with
his
nails
fantastic
shapes
on
the
stone
and
babbling
stupidly
going
jesus
going
to
jerusalem
see
he
rides
the
holy
ass
he
going
to
his
father
home
going
home
going
home
as
i
pass
he
looks
up
perplexed
wonder
on
his
face
his
brows
meet
in
a
painful
attempt
to
collect
his
wandering
thoughts
and
he
drawls
with
pathetic
going
home
going
home
jesus
going
to
father
home
the
guards
raise
their
hands
to
their
nostrils
as
they
approach
the
cell
the
poor
imbecile
evacuates
on
the
table
the
chair
and
the
floor
twice
a
month
he
is
taken
to
the
bathroom
his
clothes
are
stripped
and
the
hose
is
turned
on
the
crazy
negro
the
cell
of
little
sammy
is
vacant
he
was
number
a
young
man
from
altoona
i
knew
him
quite
well
he
was
a
kind
boy
and
a
diligent
worker
but
now
and
then
he
would
fall
into
a
fit
of
melancholy
he
would
then
sit
motionless
on
the
chair
a
blank
stare
on
his
face
neglecting
food
and
work
these
spells
generally
lasted
two
or
three
days
sammy
refusing
to
leave
the
cell
old
jimmy
mcpane
the
dead
deputy
on
such
occasions
commanded
the
prisoner
to
the
shop
while
sammy
sat
and
stared
in
a
daze
mcpane
would
order
the
stubborn
kid
to
the
dungeon
and
every
time
sammy
got
his
head
workin
he
was
dragged
silent
and
motionless
to
the
cellar
the
new
deputy
has
followed
the
established
practice
and
last
evening
at
music
hour
while
the
men
were
scraping
their
instruments
little
sammy
was
found
on
the
floor
of
the
cell
his
throat
hacked
from
ear
to
ear
at
the
coroner
inquest
the
warden
testified
that
the
boy
was
considered
mentally
defective
that
he
was
therefore
excused
from
work
and
never
punished
returning
to
my
cell
in
the
evening
my
gaze
meets
the
printed
rules
on
the
wall
the
prison
authorities
desire
to
treat
every
prisoner
in
their
charge
with
humanity
and
kindness
the
aim
of
all
prison
discipline
is
by
enforcing
the
law
to
restrain
the
evil
and
to
protect
the
innocent
from
further
harm
to
so
apply
the
law
upon
the
criminal
as
to
produce
a
cure
from
his
moral
infirmities
by
calling
out
the
better
principles
of
his
nature
chapter
xxii
the
grist
of
the
i
the
comparative
freedom
of
the
range
familiarizes
me
with
the
workings
of
the
institution
and
brings
me
in
close
contact
with
the
authorities
the
personnel
of
the
guards
is
of
very
inferior
character
i
find
their
average
intelligence
considerably
lower
than
that
of
the
inmates
especially
does
the
element
recruited
from
the
police
and
the
detective
service
lack
sympathy
with
the
unfortunates
in
their
charge
they
are
mostly
men
discharged
from
city
employment
because
of
habitual
drunkenness
or
flagrant
brutality
and
corruption
their
attitude
toward
the
prisoners
is
summed
up
in
coercion
and
suppression
they
look
upon
the
men
as
objects
of
discipline
exact
unquestioning
obedience
and
absolute
submissiveness
to
peremptory
whims
and
harbor
personal
animosity
toward
the
less
pliant
the
more
intelligent
among
the
officers
scorn
inferior
duties
and
crave
advancement
the
authority
and
remuneration
of
a
deputy
wardenship
is
alluring
to
them
and
every
keeper
considers
himself
the
fittest
for
the
vacancy
but
the
coveted
prize
is
awarded
to
the
guard
most
feared
by
the
inmates
and
most
subservient
to
the
warden
a
direct
incitement
to
brutality
on
the
one
hand
to
sycophancy
on
the
other
a
number
of
the
officers
are
veterans
of
the
civil
war
several
among
them
had
suffered
incarceration
in
libby
prison
these
often
manifest
a
more
sympathetic
spirit
the
great
majority
of
the
keepers
however
have
been
employed
in
the
penitentiary
from
fifteen
to
years
some
even
for
a
longer
period
like
officer
stewart
who
has
been
a
guard
for
forty
years
this
element
is
unspeakably
callous
and
cruel
the
prisoners
discuss
among
themselves
the
ages
of
the
old
guards
and
speculate
on
the
days
allotted
them
the
death
of
one
of
them
is
hailed
with
joy
seldom
they
are
discharged
still
more
seldom
do
they
resign
the
appearance
of
a
new
officer
sheds
hope
into
the
dismal
lives
new
guards
unless
drafted
from
the
police
bureau
are
almost
without
exception
lenient
and
forbearing
often
exceedingly
humane
the
inmates
vie
with
each
other
in
showing
complaisance
to
the
candidate
it
is
a
point
of
honor
in
their
unwritten
ethics
to
treat
him
white
they
frown
upon
the
who
seeks
to
take
advantage
of
the
green
screw
by
misusing
his
kindness
or
exploiting
his
ignorance
of
the
prison
rules
but
the
older
officers
secretly
resent
the
infusion
of
new
blood
they
strive
to
discourage
the
applicant
by
exaggerating
the
dangers
of
the
position
and
depreciating
its
financial
desirability
for
an
ambitious
young
man
they
impress
upon
him
the
warden
unfairness
to
the
guards
and
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
advancement
often
they
dissuade
the
new
man
and
he
disappears
from
the
prison
horizon
but
if
he
persists
in
remaining
the
old
keepers
expostulate
with
him
in
pretended
friendliness
upon
his
leniency
chide
him
for
a
tenderfoot
and
improve
every
opportunity
to
initiate
him
into
the
practices
of
brutality
the
system
is
known
in
the
prison
as
breaking
in
the
new
man
is
constantly
drafted
in
the
clubbing
squad
the
older
officers
setting
the
example
of
cruelty
refusal
to
participate
signifies
insubordination
to
his
superiors
and
the
shirking
of
routine
duty
and
results
in
immediate
discharge
but
such
instances
are
extremely
rare
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
officer
stewart
it
happened
only
once
and
the
man
was
sickly
slowly
the
poison
is
instilled
into
the
new
guard
within
a
short
time
the
prisoners
notice
the
first
signs
of
change
he
grows
less
tolerant
and
chummy
more
irritated
and
distant
presently
he
feels
himself
the
object
of
espionage
by
the
favorite
trusties
of
his
in
some
mysterious
manner
the
warden
is
aware
of
his
every
step
berating
him
for
speaking
unduly
long
to
this
prisoner
or
for
giving
another
half
a
banana
the
remnant
of
his
lunch
in
a
moment
of
commiseration
and
pity
the
officer
is
moved
by
the
tearful
pleadings
of
misery
to
carry
a
message
to
the
sick
wife
or
child
of
a
prisoner
the
latter
confides
the
secret
to
some
friend
or
carelessly
brags
of
his
intimacy
with
the
guard
and
soon
the
keeper
faces
the
warden
on
charges
and
is
deprived
of
a
month
pay
repeated
misplacement
of
confidence
occasional
betrayal
by
a
prisoner
seeking
the
good
graces
of
the
warden
and
the
new
officer
grows
embittered
against
the
species
convict
the
instinct
of
harassed
and
menaced
on
every
side
becomes
more
assertive
and
the
guard
is
soon
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
the
system
ii
daily
i
behold
the
machinery
at
work
grinding
and
pulverizing
brutalizing
the
officers
dehumanizing
the
inmates
far
removed
from
the
strife
and
struggle
of
the
larger
world
i
yet
witness
its
miniature
replica
more
agonizing
and
merciless
within
the
walls
a
perfected
model
it
is
this
prison
life
with
its
apparent
uniformity
and
dull
passivity
but
beneath
the
torpid
surface
smolder
the
fires
of
being
now
crackling
faintly
under
a
dun
smothering
smoke
now
blazing
forth
with
the
ruthlessness
of
despair
hidden
by
the
veil
of
discipline
rages
the
struggle
of
fiercely
contending
wills
and
intricate
meshes
are
woven
in
the
quagmire
of
darkness
and
suppression
intrigue
and
counter
plot
violence
and
corruption
are
rampant
in
and
shop
the
prisoners
spy
upon
each
other
and
in
turn
upon
the
officers
the
latter
encourage
the
trusties
in
unearthing
the
secret
doings
of
the
inmates
and
the
stools
enviously
compete
with
each
other
in
supplying
information
to
the
keepers
often
they
deliberately
inveigle
the
trustful
prisoner
into
a
fake
plot
to
escape
help
and
encourage
him
in
the
preparations
and
at
the
critical
moment
denounce
him
to
the
authorities
the
luckless
man
is
severely
punished
usually
remaining
in
utter
ignorance
of
the
intrigue
the
is
rewarded
with
greater
liberty
and
special
privileges
frequently
his
treachery
proves
the
to
freedom
aided
by
the
official
recommendation
of
the
model
prisoner
to
the
state
board
of
pardons
the
stools
and
the
trusties
are
an
essential
element
in
the
government
of
the
prison
with
rare
exception
every
officer
has
one
or
more
on
his
staff
they
assist
him
in
his
duties
perform
most
of
his
work
and
make
out
the
reports
for
the
illiterate
guards
occasionally
they
are
even
called
upon
to
help
the
clubbing
squad
the
more
intelligent
stools
enjoy
the
confidence
of
the
deputy
and
his
assistants
and
thence
advance
to
the
favor
of
the
warden
the
latter
places
more
reliance
upon
his
favorite
trusties
than
upon
the
guards
i
have
about
a
hundred
paid
officers
to
keep
watch
over
the
prisoners
the
warden
informs
new
applicant
and
two
hundred
volunteers
to
watch
both
the
volunteers
are
vested
with
unofficial
authority
often
exceeding
that
of
the
inferior
officers
they
invariably
secure
the
sinecures
of
the
prison
involving
little
work
and
affording
opportunity
for
espionage
they
are
runners
messengers
yard
and
office
men
other
desirable
positions
clerkships
and
the
like
are
awarded
to
influential
prisoners
such
as
bankers
embezzlers
and
boodlers
these
are
known
in
the
institution
as
holding
political
jobs
together
with
the
stools
they
are
scorned
by
the
initiated
prisoners
as
the
pets
the
professional
craftiness
of
the
con
man
stands
him
in
good
stead
in
the
prison
a
shrewd
judge
of
human
nature
and
he
applies
the
practiced
cunning
of
his
vocation
to
secure
whatever
privileges
and
perquisites
the
institution
affords
his
evident
intelligence
and
aplomb
powerfully
impress
the
guards
his
deference
to
authority
flatters
them
they
are
awed
by
his
wonderful
facility
of
expression
and
great
attainments
in
the
mysterious
world
of
baccarat
and
confidence
games
at
heart
they
envy
the
high
priest
of
easy
money
and
are
proud
to
befriend
him
in
his
need
the
officers
exert
themselves
to
please
him
secure
light
work
for
him
and
surreptitiously
favor
him
with
delicacies
and
even
money
his
game
is
won
the
con
has
now
secured
the
friendship
and
confidence
of
his
keepers
and
will
continue
to
exploit
them
by
pretended
warm
interest
in
their
physical
complaints
their
family
troubles
and
their
whispered
ambition
of
promotion
and
fear
of
the
discrimination
the
more
intelligent
officers
are
the
easiest
victims
of
his
wiles
but
even
the
higher
officials
more
difficult
to
approach
do
not
escape
the
confidence
man
his
business
has
perfected
his
sense
of
orientation
he
quickly
rends
the
veil
of
appearance
and
scans
the
undercurrents
he
frets
at
his
imprisonment
and
hints
at
high
social
connections
his
real
identity
is
a
great
secret
he
wishes
to
save
his
wealthy
relatives
from
public
disgrace
a
careless
slip
of
the
tongue
betrays
his
college
education
with
a
deprecating
nod
he
confesses
that
his
father
is
a
state
senator
he
is
the
only
black
sheep
in
his
family
yet
they
are
good
to
him
and
will
not
disown
him
but
he
must
not
bring
notoriety
upon
them
eager
for
special
privileges
and
the
liberty
of
the
trusties
or
fearful
of
punishment
the
con
man
matures
his
campaign
he
writes
a
note
to
a
with
much
detail
and
thorough
knowledge
of
prison
conditions
he
exposes
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
institution
in
elegant
english
he
criticizes
the
management
dwells
upon
the
ignorance
and
brutality
of
the
guards
and
charges
the
warden
and
the
board
of
prison
inspectors
with
graft
individually
and
collectively
he
denounces
the
warden
as
a
of
poor
unfortunates
the
counties
pay
from
to
thirty
cents
per
day
for
each
inmate
the
federal
government
for
its
quota
of
men
fifty
cents
per
person
why
are
the
prisoners
given
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
inadequate
food
he
demands
does
not
the
state
appropriate
thousands
of
dollars
for
the
support
of
the
penitentiary
besides
the
money
received
from
the
counties
with
keen
scalpel
the
con
man
dissects
the
anatomy
of
the
institution
one
by
one
he
analyzes
the
industries
showing
the
most
intimate
knowledge
the
hosiery
department
produces
so
and
so
many
dozen
of
stockings
per
day
they
are
not
stamped
as
the
law
requires
the
labels
attached
are
misleading
and
calculated
to
decoy
the
innocent
buyer
the
character
of
the
product
in
the
several
mat
shops
is
similarly
an
infraction
of
the
statutes
of
the
great
state
of
pennsylvania
for
the
protection
of
free
labor
the
broom
shop
is
leased
by
contract
to
a
firm
of
manufacturers
known
as
lang
brothers
the
law
expressly
forbids
contract
labor
in
prisons
the
stamp
on
the
brooms
is
pasted
over
with
a
label
concealing
the
source
of
manufacture
thus
the
con
man
runs
on
in
his
note
with
much
show
of
secrecy
he
entrusts
it
to
a
notorious
stool
for
delivery
to
a
friend
soon
the
writer
is
called
before
the
warden
in
the
latter
hands
is
the
note
the
offender
smiles
complacently
he
is
aware
the
authorities
are
terrorized
by
the
disclosure
of
such
intimate
familiarity
with
the
secrets
of
the
prison
house
in
the
possession
of
an
intelligent
possibly
man
he
must
be
propitiated
at
all
cost
the
con
man
joins
the
politicians
the
ingenuity
of
imprisoned
intelligence
treads
devious
paths
all
leading
to
the
highway
of
enlarged
liberty
and
privilege
the
veteran
of
experience
easily
avoids
hard
labor
he
has
many
friends
in
the
prison
is
familiar
with
the
keepers
and
is
welcomed
by
them
like
a
prodigal
coming
home
the
officers
are
glad
to
renew
the
old
acquaintance
and
talk
over
old
times
it
brings
interest
into
their
tedious
existence
often
as
gray
and
monotonous
as
the
prisoner
the
seasoned
yeggman
constitutionally
and
on
principle
opposed
to
toil
rarely
works
generally
suffering
a
comparatively
short
sentence
he
looks
upon
his
imprisonment
as
in
a
measure
a
from
the
wear
and
tear
of
tramp
life
above
average
intelligence
he
scorns
work
in
general
prison
labor
in
particular
he
avoids
it
with
unstinted
expense
of
energy
and
effort
as
a
last
resort
he
plays
the
jigger
card
producing
an
artificial
wound
on
leg
or
arm
having
every
appearance
of
syphilitic
excrescence
he
pretends
to
be
frightened
by
the
infection
and
prevails
upon
the
physician
to
examine
him
the
doctor
wonders
at
the
wound
closely
resembling
the
dreaded
disease
ever
had
syphilis
he
demands
the
prisoner
protests
indignantly
perhaps
in
the
family
the
medicus
suggests
the
patient
looks
diffident
blushes
cries
no
never
and
assumes
a
guilty
look
the
doctor
is
now
convinced
the
prisoner
is
a
victim
of
syphilis
the
man
is
excused
from
work
indefinitely
the
wily
yegg
now
a
patient
secures
a
snap
in
the
yard
and
adapts
prison
conditions
to
his
habits
of
life
he
sedulously
courts
the
friendship
of
some
young
inmate
and
wins
his
admiration
by
ghost
stories
of
great
daring
and
cunning
he
puts
the
boy
next
to
de
ropes
and
constitutes
himself
his
protector
against
the
abuse
of
the
guards
and
the
advances
of
other
prisoners
he
guides
the
youth
steps
through
the
maze
of
conflicting
rules
and
finally
initiates
him
into
the
higher
wisdom
of
de
road
the
path
of
the
gun
is
smoothed
by
his
colleagues
in
the
prison
even
before
his
arrival
the
de
of
the
profession
is
at
work
securing
a
soft
berth
for
the
expected
friend
if
noted
for
success
and
skill
he
enjoys
the
respect
of
the
officers
and
the
admiration
of
a
retinue
of
aspiring
young
crooks
of
lesser
experience
and
reputation
with
conscious
superiority
he
instructs
them
in
the
finesse
of
his
trade
practices
them
in
touches
and
imbues
them
with
the
philosophy
of
the
plenitude
of
suckers
whom
the
good
god
has
put
upon
the
earth
to
afford
the
thief
an
honest
living
his
sentence
nearing
completion
the
gun
grows
thoughtful
carefully
scans
the
papers
forms
plans
for
his
first
job
arranges
dates
with
his
partners
and
gathers
messages
for
their
moll
buzzers
he
is
gravely
concerned
with
the
somewhat
roughened
condition
of
his
hands
and
the
possible
dulling
of
his
sensitive
fingers
he
maneuvers
generally
successfully
for
lighter
work
to
limber
up
a
bit
jollies
the
officers
and
cajoles
the
warden
for
new
shoes
made
to
measure
in
the
local
shops
and
insists
on
the
allowance
to
prisoners
received
from
counties
outside

he
argues
the
need
of
money
to
leave
the
state
often
he
does
leave
more
frequently
a
number
of
charges
against
the
man
are
held
in
reserve
by
the
police
and
he
is
arrested
at
the
gate
by
detectives
who

been
previously
notified
by

plod
along
in
the
shops
in
sullen
misery
and
dread
day
in
day
out
year
after
year
they
drudge
at
the
monotonous
work
dully
wondering
at
the
numerous
trusties
idling
about
while
their
own
heavy
tasks
are
constantly
increased
from
cell
to
shop
and
back
again
always
under
the
stern
eyes
of
the
guards
their
days
drag
in
deadening
toil
in
mute
bewilderment
they
receive
contradictory
orders
unaware
of
the
secret
antagonisms
between
the
officials
they
are
surprised
at
the
new
rule
making
attendance
at
religious
service
obligatory
and
again
at
the
succeeding
order
the
desired
appropriation
for
a
new
chapel
having
been
secured
making
optional
they
are
astonished
at
the
sudden
disappearance
of
the
considerate
and
gentle
guard
byers
and
anxiously
hope
for
his
return
not
knowing
that
the
officer
who
discouraged
the
underhand
methods
of
the
trusties
fell
a
victim
to
their
cabal
iii
occasionally
a
bolder
spirit
grumbles
at
the
exasperating
partiality
released
from
punishment
he
patiently
awaits
an
opportunity
to
complain
to
the
warden
of
his
unjust
treatment
weeks
pass
at
last
the
captain
visits
the
shop
a
propitious
moment
the
carefully
trimmed
beard
frames
the
stern
face
in
benevolent
white
mellowing
the
hard
features
and
lending
dignity
to
his
appearance
his
eyes
brighten
with
peculiar
brilliancy
as
he
slowly
begins
to
stroke
his
chin
and
then
almost
imperceptibly
presses
his
fingers
to
his
lips
as
he
passes
through
the
shop
the
prisoner
raises
his
hand
what
is
it
the
warden
inquires
a
pleasant
smile
on
his
face
the
man
relates
his
grievance
with
nervous
eagerness
oh
well
the
captain
claps
him
on
the
shoulder
perhaps
a
mistake
an
unfortunate
mistake
but
then
you
might
have
done
something
at
another
time
and
not
been
punished
he
laughs
merrily
at
his
witticism
it
so
long
ago
anyhow
we
forget
it
and
he
passes
on
but
if
the
captain
is
in
a
different
mood
his
features
harden
the
stern
eyes
scowl
and
he
says
in
his
clear
sharp
tones
state
your
grievance
in
writing
on
the
printed
slip
which
the
officer
will
give
you
the
written
complaint
deposited
in
the
finally
reaches
the
chaplain
and
is
forwarded
by
him
to
the
warden
office
there
the
deputy
and
the
assistant
deputy
read
and
classify
the
slips
placing
some
on
the
captain
file
and
throwing
others
into
the
waste
basket
according
as
the
accusation
is
directed
against
a
friendly
or
an
unfriendly
brother
officer
months
pass
before
the
prisoner
is
called
for
a
hearing
by
that
time
he
very
likely
has
a
more
serious
charge
against
the
guard
who
now
persecutes
the
kicker
but
the
new
complaint
has
not
yet
been
filed
and
therefore
the
hearing
is
postponed
not
infrequently
men
are
called
for
a
hearing
who
have
been
discharged
or
died
since
making
the
complaint
the
persevering
prisoner
however
unable
to
receive
satisfaction
from
the
warden
sends
a
written
complaint
to
some
member
of
the
highest
authority
in
the
penitentiary
the
board
of
inspectors
these
are
supposed
to
meet
monthly
to
consider
the
affairs
of
the
institution
visit
the
inmates
and
minister
to
their
moral
needs
the
complainant
waits
mails
several
more
slips
and
wonders
why
he
receives
no
audience
with
the
inspectors
but
the
latter
remain
invisible
some
not
visiting
the
penitentiary
within
a
year
only
the
secretary
of
the
board
reed
a
wealthy
jeweler
of
pittsburgh
occasionally
puts
in
an
appearance
tall
and
lean
immaculate
and
trim
he
exhales
an
atmosphere
of
sanctimoniousness
he
walks
leisurely
through
the
block
passes
a
cell
with
a
lithograph
of
christ
on
the
wall
and
pauses
his
hands
folded
eyes
turned
upwards
lips
slightly
parted
in
silent
prayer
he
inquires
of
the
rangeman
whose
cell
is
this
a
reed
the
prisoner
informs
him
it
is
the
cell
of
jasper
the
colored
trusty
chief
stool
of
the
prison
he
is
a
good
man
a
good
man
god
bless
him
the
inspector
says
a
quaver
in
his
voice
he
steps
into
the
cell
puts
on
his
gloves
and
carefully
adjusts
the
little
and
the
rules
hanging
awry
on
the
wall
it
offends
my
eye
he
smiles
at
the
attending
rangeman

officer
of
the
shop
where
nold
is
employed
has
been
severely
reprimanded
for
neglect
of
duty
the
warden
had
noticed
carl
in
the
company
of
several
other
prisoners
passing
through
the
yard
with
a
load
of
mattings
he
ordered
the
guard
never
to
allow
nold
out
of
his
sight
bauer
has
also
felt
the
hand
of
petty
tyranny
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
dark
clothes
and
reduced
to
the
stripes
for
disrespectful
behavior
now
he
is
removed
to
the
north
wing
where
my
cell
also
is
located
while
nold
is
in
the
south
wing
in
a
double
cell
enjoying
the
luxury
of
a
window
fortunately
though
our
friend
the
horsethief
is
still
on
bauer
range
thus
enabling
me
to
reach

reading
my

returns
them
to
our
trusted

who
works
in
the
same

with
carl
our

connections
are
therefore
complete
each
of
us
exercising
utmost
care
not
to
be
trapped
during
the
frequent

our

laureate
has
also
been
released
his
short
term
having

his
identity
remains
a
mystery
he
having
merely
hinted
that
he
was
a
scientist
of
the
old
school
an
alchemist
from
which
we
inferred
that
he
was

the
vicissitudes
of

the
illness

of

badly
disarrange

that
the

might
prove
of

to
a
larger
public
and
should
be
preserved
we
discuss
the
unique
plan
wondering
how
the
intellectual
contraband
could
be
smuggled
into
the
light
of
day
in
our
perplexity
we
finally
take
counsel
with
bob
the
faithful
commissary
he
cuts
the
gordian
knot
with
astonishing
levity
youse
fellows
jest
go
ahead
an
write
an
do
bother
about
nothin
think
i
can
walk
off
all
right
with
a
team
of
horses
but
got
brains
enough
to
get
away
with
a
bit
of
scribbling
eh
jest
leave
that
to
th
horsethief
an
write
till
you
bust
th
paper
works
see
thus
encouraged
with
entire
confidence
in
our
resourceful
friend
we
give
the
matter
serious
thought
and
before
long
we
form
the
ambitious
project
of
publishing
a
book
by
mkg
in
high
elation
with
new
interest
in
life
we
set
to
work
the
little
magazine
is
suspended
and
we
devote
all
our
spare
time
as
well
as
every
available
scrap
of
writing
material
to
the
larger
purpose
we
decide
to
honor
the
approaching
day
so
pregnant
with
revolutionary
inspiration
and
as
the
sun
bursts
in
brilliant
splendor
on
the

i
the
summer
fades
into
days
of
dull
gray
the
fog
thickens
on

the
prison
house
is
dim
and
damp
the

sirens
sound
sharp
and
shrill
and
the
cells
echo
with
coughing

from

i
am
advanced

but
one
morning
the
levers
are
pulled
the
cells
unlocked
and
the

fed
while
i
remain
under
key
i
wonder
at
the
peculiar
oversight
and
rap
on
the
bars
for
the
officers
the
block
captain
orders
me
to
desist
request
to
see
the
warden
but
am
gruffly
told
that
he
can
not
be
disturbed
in
the
morning
in
vain
i
rack
my
brain
to
fathom
the
cause
of
my
punishment
i
review
the
incidents
of
the
past
weeks
ponder
over
each
detail
but
the
mystery
remains
unsolved
perhaps
i
have
unwittingly
offended
some
trusty
or
i
may
be
the
object
of
the
secret
enmity
of
a
spy
the
chaplain
on
his
daily
rounds
hands
me
a
letter
from
the
girl
and
glances
in
surprise
at
the
closed
door
not
feeling
well
m
boy
he
asks
i
locked
up
chaplain
what
have
you
done
nothing
that
i
know
of
oh
well
you
be
out
soon
do
fret
m
boy
but
the
days
pass
and
i
remain
in
the
cell
the
guards
look
worried
and
vent
their
in
profuse
vulgarity
the
deputy
tries
to
appear
mysterious
wobbles
comically
along
the
range
and
splutters
at
me
nothin
shtay
where
you
are
jasper
the
colored
trusty
flits
up
and
down
the
hall
tremendously
busy
his
black
face
more
lustrous
than
ever
numerous
stools
nose
about
the
galleries
stop
here
and
there
in
confidential
conversation
with
officers
and
prisoners
and
whisper
excitedly
at
the
front
desk
assistant
deputy
hopkins
goes
in
and
out
of
the
block
repeatedly
calls
jasper
to
the
office
and
hovers
in
the
neighborhood
of
my
cell
the
rangemen
talk
in
suppressed
tones
an
air
of
mystery
pervades
the
finally
i
am
called
to
the
warden
with
unconcealed
annoyance
he
demands
what
did
you
want
the
officers
locked
me
up
who
said
you
locked
up
he
interrupts
angrily
you
merely
locked
where
the
difference
i
ask
one
is
locked
up
cause
you
just
kept
in
for
the
present
on
what
charge
no
charge
none
whatever
take
him
back
officers
close
confinement
becomes
increasingly
more
dismal
and
dreary
by
contrast
with
the
spacious
hall
the
cell
grows
smaller
and
narrower
oppressing
me
with
a
sense
of
suffocation
my
sudden
isolation
remains
unexplained
notwithstanding
the
chaplain
promise
to
intercede
in
my
behalf
i
remain
locked
in
and
again
return
the
days
of
solitary
with
all
their
gloom
and
anguish
of
heart
ii
a
ray
of
light
is
shed
from
new
york
the
girl
writes
in
a
hopeful
vein
about
the
progress
of
the
movement
and
the
intense
interest
in
my
case
among
radical
circles
she
refers
to
comrade
merlino
now
on
a
tour
of
agitation
and
is
enthusiastic
about
the
favorable
labor
sentiment
toward
me
manifested
in
the
cities
he
had
visited
finally
she
informs
me
of
a
plan
on
foot
to
secure
a
reduction
of
my
sentence
and
the
promising
outlook
for
the
collection
of
the
necessary
funds
from
merlino
i
receive
a
sum
of
money
already
contributed
for
the
purpose
together
with
a
letter
of
appreciation
and
encouragement
concluding
good
cheer
dear
comrade
the
last
word
has
not
yet
been
spoken
my
mind
dwells
among
my
friends
the
breath
from
the
world
of
the
living
fans
the
smoldering
fires
of
longing
the
tone
of
my
comrades
revibrates
in
my
heart
with
trembling
hope
but
the
revision
of
my
sentence
involves
recourse
to
the
courts
the
sudden
realization
fills
me
with
dismay
i
can
not
be
guilty
of
a
sacrifice
of
principle
to
gain
freedom
the
mere
suggestion
rouses
the
violent
protest
of
my
revolutionary
traditions
in
bitterness
of
soul
i
resent
my
friends
waking
of
the
shades
i
shall
never
leave
the
house
of
death
and
yet
mail
from
my
friends
full
of
expectation
and
confidence
arrives
more
frequently
prominent
lawyers
have
been
consulted
their
unanimous
opinion
augurs
well
the
multiplication
of
my
sentences
was
illegal
according
to
the
statutes
of
pennsylvania
the
maximum
penalty
should
not
have
exceeded
seven
years
the
supreme
court
would
undoubtedly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
lower
tribunal
specifically
the
conviction
on
charges
not
constituting
a
crime
under
the
laws
of
the
state
and
so
forth
i
am
assailed
by
doubts
is
it
consequent
in
me
to
decline
liberty
apparently
within
reach
john
most
appealed
his
case
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
girl
also
took
advantage
of
a
legal
defence
considerable
propaganda
resulted
from
it
should
i
refuse
the
opportunity
which
would
offer
such
a
splendid
field
for
agitation
would
it
not
be
folly
to
afford
the
enemy
the
triumph
of
my
gradual
annihilation
i
would
without
hesitation
reject
freedom
at
the
price
of
my
convictions
but
it
involves
no
denial
of
my
faith
to
rob
the
vampire
of
its
prey
we
must
if
necessary
fight
the
beast
of
oppression
with
its
own
methods
scourge
the
law
in
its
own
tracks
as
it
were
of
course
the
supreme
court
is
but
another
weapon
in
the
hands
of
authority
a
pretence
of
impartial
right
it
decided
against
most
sustaining
the
prejudiced
verdict
of
the
trial
jury
they
may
do
the
same
in
my
case
but
that
very
circumstance
will
serve
to
confirm
our
arraignment
of
class
justice
i
shall
therefore
endorse
the
efforts
of
my
friends
but
before
long
i
am
informed
that
an
application
to
the
higher
court
is
not
permitted
the
attorneys
upon
examination
of
the
records
of
the
trial
discovered
a
fatal
obstacle
they
said
the
defendant
not
being
legally
represented
neglected
to
take
exceptions
to
rulings
of
the
court
prejudicial
to
the
accused
because
of
the
technical
omission
there
exists
no
basis
for
an
appeal
they
therefore
advise
an
application
to
the
board
of
pardons
on
the
ground
that
the
punishment
in
my
case
is
excessive
they
are
confident
that
the
board
will
act
favorably
in
view
of
the
obvious
unconstitutionality
of
the
compounded
sentences
the
five
minor
indictments
being
indispensible
parts
of
the
major
charge
and
as
such
not
constituting
separate
offences
the
unexpected
development
disquiets
me
the
sound
of
pardon
is
detestable
what
bitter
irony
that
the
noblest
intentions
the
most
unselfish
motives
need
seek
pardon
aye
of
the
very
source
that
misinterprets
and
perverts
them
for
days
the
implied
humiliation
keeps
agitating
me
i
recoil
from
the
thought
of
personally
affixing
my
name
to
the
meek
supplication
of
the
printed
form
and
finally
decide
to
refuse
an
accidental
conversation
with
the
attorney
general
disturbs
my
resolution
i
learn
that
in
pennsylvania
the
applicant
signature
is
not
required
by
the
pardon
board
a
sense
of
guilty
hope
steals
over
me
yet
i
reflect
the
pardon
of
the
chicago
anarchists
had
contributed
much
to
the
dissemination
of
our
ideas
the
impartial
analysis
of
the
by
governor
altgeld
completely
exonerated
our
comrades
from
responsibility
for
the
haymarket
tragedy
and
exposed
the
heinous
conspiracy
to
destroy
the
most
devoted
and
able
representatives
of
the
labor
movement
may
not
a
similar
purpose
be
served
by
my
application
for
a
pardon
i
write
to
my
comrades
signifying
my
consent
we
arrange
for
a
personal
interview
to
discuss
the
details
of
the
work
unfortunately
the
girl
a
non
can
not
visit
me
but
a
mutual
friend
miss
garrison
is
to
call
on
me
within
two
months
at
my
request
the
chaplain
forwards
to
her
the
necessary
permission
and
i
impatiently
await
the
first
friendly
face
in
two
years
iii
as
unaccountably
as
my
punishment
in
the
solitary
comes
the
relief
at
the
expiration
of
three
weeks
the
k
is
still
in
the
hospital
and
i
resume
the
duties
of
rangeman
the
guards
eye
me
with
suspicion
and
greater
vigilance
but
i
soon
unravel
the
tangled
skein
and
learn
the
details
of
the
abortive
escape
that
caused
my
temporary
retirement
the
lock
of
my
neighbor
johnny
smith
had
been
tampered
with
the
youth
in
solitary
at
the
time
necessarily
had
the
aid
of
another
it
being
impossible
to
reach
the
keyhole
from
the
inside
of
the
cell
the
suspicion
of
the
warden
centered
upon
me
but
investigation
by
the
stools
discovered
the
men
actually
concerned
and
dutch
adams
spencer
smith
and
jim
grant
were
chastised
in
the
dungeon
and
are
now
locked
up
for
cause
on
my
range
by
degrees
johnny
confides
to
me
the
true
story
of
the
frustrated
plan
dutch
a
repeater
serving
his
fifth
bit
and
favorite
of
hopkins
procured
a
piece
of
old
iron
and
had
it
fashioned
into
a
key
in
the
machine
shop
where
he
was
employed
he
entrusted
the
rude
instrument
to
grant
a
young
reformatory
boy
for
a
preliminary
trial
the
guileless
youth
easily
walked
into
the
trap
and
the
makeshift
key
was
broken
in
the
lock
with
disastrous
results
the
tricked
boys
now
swear
vengeance
upon
the
but
dutch
is
missing
from
the
range
he
has
been
removed
to
an
upper
gallery
and
is
assigned
to
a
coveted
position
in
the
shops
the
newspapers
print
vivid
stories
of
the
desperate
attempt
to
escape
from
riverside
and
compliment
captain
wright
and
the
officers
for
so
successfully
protecting
the
community
the
warden
is
deeply
affected
and
orders
the
additional
punishment
of
the
offenders
with
a
diet
the
deputy
walks
with
inflated
chest
hopkins
issues
orders
curtailing
the
privileges
of
the
inmates
and
inflicting
greater
hardships
the
tone
of
the
guards
sounds
haughtier
more
peremptory
jasper
face
wears
a
blissful
smile
the
trusties
look
pleased
and
cheerful
but
sullen
gloom
shrouds
the
prison
iv
i
am
standing
at
my
cell
when
the
door
of
the
rotunda
slowly
opens
and
the
warden
approaches
me

lady

of
my
friends

request

by
telegraph
what

through

from

galleries
i
hear
the
jeering
of
a
trusty
a
guard
near
by
brings
his
thumb
to
his
nose
and
wriggles
his
fingers
in
my
direction
humiliated
and
angry
i
return
to
the
cell
to
find
the
monthly
on
my
table
i
pour
out
all
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
to
the
girl
dwell
on
the
discrimination
against
me
and
repeat
our
conversation
and
his
refusal
to
admit
my
visitor
in
conclusion
i
direct
her
to
have
a
pittsburgh
lawyer
apply
to
the
courts
to
force
the
prison
authorities
to
restore
to
me
the
privileges
allowed
by
the
law
to
the
ordinary
prisoner
i
drop
the
letter
in
the
hoping
that
my
outburst
and
the
threat
of
the
law
will
induce
the
warden
to
retreat
from
his
position
the
girl
will
of
course
understand
the
significance
of
the
epistle
aware
that
my
reference
to
a
court
process
is
a
diplomatic
subterfuge
for
effect
and
not
meant
to
be
acted
upon
but
the
next
day
the
chaplain
returns
the
letter
to
me
not
so
rash
my
boy
he
warns
me
not
unkindly
be
patient
i
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
but
the
letter
chaplain
you
wasted
your
paper
aleck
i
ca
pass
this
letter
but
just
keep
quiet
and
i
look
into
the
matter
weeks
pass
in
evasive
replies
finally
the
chaplain
advises
a
personal
interview
with
the
warden
the
latter
refers
me
to
the
inspectors
to
each
member
of
the
board
i
address
a
request
for
a
few
conversation
but
a
month
goes
by
without
word
from
the
high
officials
the
friendly
runner
southside
johnny
offers
to
give
me
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
an
inspector
on
the
payment
of
ten
plugs
of
tobacco
unfortunately
i
can
not
spare
my
small
allowance
but
i
tender
him
a
dollar
bill
of
the
money
the
girl
had
sent
me
artfully
concealed
in
the
buckle
of
a
pair
of
suspenders
the
runner
is
highly
elated
and
assures
me
of
success
directing
me
to
keep
careful
watch
on
the
yard
door
several
days
later
passing
along
the
range
engaged
in
my
duties
i
notice
southside
entering
from
the
yard
in
friendly
conversation
with
a
strange
gentleman
in
citizen
clothes
for
a
moment
i
do
not
realize
the
situation
but
the
next
instant
i
am
aware
of
johnny
violent
efforts
to
attract
my
attention
he
pretends
to
show
the
man
some
fancy
work
made
by
the
inmates
all
the
while
drawing
him
closer
to
my
door
with
surreptitious
nods
at
me
i
approach
my
cell
this
is
berkman
nevin
the
man
who
shot
frick
johnny
remarks
the
gentleman
turns
to
me
with
a
look
of
interest
good
morning
berkman
he
says
pleasantly
how
long
are
you
doing
years
i
sorry
to
hear
that
it
rather
a
long
sentence
you
know
who
i
am
inspector
nevin
i
believe
yes
you
have
never
seen
me
before
no
i
sent
a
request
to
see
you
recently
when
was
that
a
month
ago
strange
i
was
in
the
office
three
weeks
ago
there
was
no
note
from
you
on
my
file
are
you
sure
you
sent
one
quite
sure
i
sent
a
request
to
each
inspector
what
the
trouble
i
inform
him
briefly
that
i
have
been
deprived
of
visiting
privileges
somewhat
surprised
he
glances
at
my
dark
clothes
and
remarks
you
are
in
the
first
grade
and
therefore
entitled
to
visits
when
did
you
have
your
last
visitor
two
years
ago
two
years
he
asks
almost
incredulously
did
the
lady
from
new
york
have
a
permit
the
warden
hurriedly
enters
from
the
yard
nevin
he
calls
out
anxiously
i
been
looking
for
you
berkman
was
just
telling
me
about
his
visitor
being
sent
away
captain
the
inspector
remarks
yes
yes
the
warden
smiles
forcedly
cause
oh
the
face
of
nevin
assumes
a
grave
look
berkman
he
turns
to
me
you
have
to
apply
to
the
secretary
of
the
board
reed
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
internal
affairs
the
warden
links
his
arm
with
the
inspector
and
they
walk
toward
the
yard
door
at
the
entrance
they
are
met
by
dutch
adams
the
shop
messenger
good
morning
nevin
the
trusty
greets
him
wo
you
issue
me
a
special
visit
my
mother
is
sick
she
wants
to
see
me
the
warden
grins
at
the
ready
fiction
when
did
you
have
your
last
visit
the
inspector
inquires
two
weeks
ago
you
are
entitled
to
one
only
every
three
months
that
is
why
i
asked
you
for
an
extra
mr
inspector
dutch
retorts
boldly
i
know
you
are
a
kind
man
nevin
smiles
and
glances
at
the
warden
dutch
is
all
right
the
captain
nods
the
inspector
draws
his
visiting
card
pencils
on
it
and
hands
it
to
the
prisoner
chapter
xxiv
thoughts
that
stole
out
of
prison
april
my
dear
girl
i
have
craved
for
a
long
long
time
to
have
a
free
talk
with
you
but
this
is
the
first
opportunity
a
good
friend
a
lover
of
horseflesh
promised
to
see
this
birdie
through
i
hope
it
will
reach
you
safely
in
my
local
correspondence
you
have
been
christened
the
immutable
i
realize
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
up
through
the
endless
years
the
points
of
mutual
interest
gradually
waning
it
is
one
of
the
tragedies
in
the
existence
of
a
prisoner
k
and
g
have
almost
ceased
to
expect
mail
but
i
am
more
fortunate
the
twin
writes
very
seldom
nowadays
the
correspondence
of
other
friends
is
fitful
but
you
are
never
disappointing
it
is
not
so
much
the
contents
that
matter
these
increasingly
sound
like
the
language
of
a
strange
world
with
its
bewildering
flurry
and
ferment
disturbing
the
calm
of
but
the
very
arrival
of
a
letter
is
momentous
it
brings
a
glow
into
the
prisoner
heart
to
feel
that
he
is
remembered
actively
with
that
intimate
interest
which
alone
can
support
a
regular
correspondence
and
then
your
letters
are
so
vital
so
palpitating
with
the
throb
of
our
common
cause
i
have
greatly
enjoyed
your
communications
from
paris
and
vienna
the
accounts
of
the
movement
and
of
our
european
comrades
your
letters
are
so
much
part
of
yourself
they
bring
me
nearer
to
you
and
to
life
the
newspaper
clippings
you
have
referred
to
on
various
occasions
have
been
withheld
from
me
nor
are
any
radical
publications
permitted
i
especially
regret
to
miss
i
have
not
seen
a
single
copy
since
its
resurrection
two
years
ago
i
have
followed
the
activities
of
chas
mowbray
and
the
recent
tour
of
john
turner
so
far
as
the
press
accounts
are
concerned
i
hope
you
write
more
about
our
english
comrades
i
need
not
say
much
of
the
local
life
dear
that
you
know
from
my
official
mail
and
you
can
read
between
the
lines
the
action
of
the
pardon
board
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
me
no
less
to
you
also
i
suppose
not
that
i
was
very
enthusiastic
as
to
a
favorable
decision
but
that
they
should
so
cynically
evade
the
issue
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
i
had
hoped
they
would
at
least
consider
the
case
but
evidently
they
were
averse
to
going
on
record
one
way
or
another
the
lawyers
informed
me
that
they
were
not
even
allowed
an
opportunity
to
present
their
arguments
the
board
ruled
that
the
wrong
complained
of
is
not
actual
that
is
that
i
am
not
yet
serving
the
sentence
we
want
remitted
a
lawyer
quibble
it
means
that
i
must
serve
the
first
sentence
of
seven
years
before
applying
for
the
remission
of
the
other
indictments
discounting
commutation
time
i
still
have
about
a
year
to
complete
the
first
sentence
i
doubt
whether
it
is
advisable
to
try
again
little
justice
can
be
expected
from
those
quarters
but
i
want
to
submit
another
proposition
to
you
consult
with
our
friends
regarding
it
it
is
this
there
is
a
prisoner
here
who
has
just
been
pardoned
by
the
board
whose
president
the
is
indebted
to
the
prisoner
lawyer
for
certain
political
services
the
attorney
name
is
k
d
of
pittsburgh
he
has
intimated
to
his
client
that
he
will
guarantee
my
release
for
the
sum
to
be
deposited
in
safe
hands
and
to
be
paid
in
case
of
success
of
course
we
can
not
afford
such
a
large
fee
and
i
can
not
say
whether
the
offer
is
worth
considering
still
you
know
that
almost
anything
can
be
bought
from
politicians
i
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
the
question
of
my
visits
seems
tacitly
settled
i
can
procure
no
permit
for
my
friends
to
see
me
for
some
obscure
reason
the
warden
has
conceived
a
great
fear
of
an
anarchist
plot
against
the
prison
the
local
trio
is
under
special
surveillance
and
constantly
discriminated
against
though
k
and
g
are
permitted
to
receive
visits
you
will
smile
at
the
infantile
terror
of
the
authorities
it
is
bruited
about
that
a
certain
anarchist
lady
meaning
you
i
presume
in
reality
it
was
henry
sweetheart
a
jolly
girl
made
a
threat
against
the
prison
the
gossips
have
it
that
she
visited
inspector
reed
at
his
business
place
and
requested
to
see
me
the
inspector
refusing
she
burst
out
we
blow
your
dirty
walls
down
i
could
not
determine
whether
there
is
any
foundation
for
the
story
but
it
is
circulated
here
and
the
prisoners
firmly
believe
it
explains
my
deprivation
of
visits
that
is
a
characteristic
instance
of
local
conditions
involuntarily
i
smile
at
kennan
naïve
indignation
with
the
brutalities
he
thinks
possible
only
in
russian
and
siberian
prisons
he
would
find
it
almost
impossible
to
learn
the
true
conditions
in
the
american
prisons
he
would
be
conducted
the
rounds
of
the
show
cells
always
neat
and
clean
for
the
purpose
he
would
not
see
the
basket
cell
nor
the
bull
rings
in
the
dungeon
where
men
are
chained
for
days
nor
would
he
be
permitted
to
converse
for
hours
or
whole
evenings
with
the
prisoners
as
he
did
with
the
exiles
in
siberia
yet
if
he
succeeded
in
learning
even
half
the
truth
he
would
be
forced
to
revise
his
views
of
american
penal
institutions
as
he
did
in
regard
to
russian
politicals
he
would
be
horrified
to
witness
the
brutality
that
is
practised
here
as
a
matter
of
routine
the
abuse
of
the
insane
the
petty
persecution
inhumanity
is
the
keynote
of
stupidity
in
power
your
soul
must
have
been
harrowed
by
the
reports
of
the
terrible
tortures
in
montjuich
what
is
all
indignation
and
lamenting
in
the
face
of
the
revival
of
the
inquisition
is
there
no
nemesis
in
spain
chapter

how
shall
the
depths
cry
i
the
change
of
seasons
varies
the
tone
of
the
prison
a
cheerier
atmosphere
pervades
the
shops
and
the
in
the
summer
the
block
is
airier
and
lighter
the
guards
relax
their
stern
look
in
anticipation
of
their
vacations
the
men
hopefully
count
the
hours
till
their
approaching
freedom
and
the
gates
open
daily
to
release
some
one
going
back
to
the
world
but
heavy
gloom
broods
over
the
prison
in
winter
the
windows
are
closed
and
nailed
the
vitiated
air
artificially
heated
is
suffocating
with
dryness
smoke
darkens
the
shops
and
the
cells
are
in
constant
dusk
tasks
grow
heavier
the
punishments
more
severe
the
officers
look
sullen
the
men
are
morose
and
discontented
the
ravings
of

insane
become
wilder
suicides
more
frequent
despair
and
hopelessness
oppress
every
heart
the
undercurrent
of
rebellion
swelling
with
mute
suffering
and
repression
turbulently
sweeps
the
barriers
the
severity
of
the
authorities
increases
methods
of
penalizing
are
more
drastic
the
prisoners
fret
wax
more
querulous
and
turn
desperate
with
blind
spasmodic
defiance
but
among
the
more
intelligent
inmates
dissatisfaction
manifest
more
coherent
expression
the
lexow
investigation
in
new
york
has
awakened
an
echo
in
the
prison
a
movement
is
quietly
initiated
among
the
solitaries
looking
toward
an
investigation
of
riverside
i
keep
busy
helping
the
men
exchange
notes
maturing
the
project
great
care
must
be
exercised
to
guard
against
treachery
only
men
of
proved
reliability
may
be
entrusted
with
the
secret
and
precautions
taken
that
no
officer
or
stool
scent
our
design
the
details
of
the
campaign
are
planned
on
k
range
with
billy
ryan
butch
sloane
and
jimmie
grant
as
the
most
trustworthy
in
command
it
is
decided
that
the
attack
upon
the
management
of
the
penitentiary
is
to
be
initiated
from
the
outside
a
released
prisoner
is
to
inform
the
press
of
the
abuses
graft
and
immorality
rampant
in
riverside
the
public
will
demand
an
investigation
the
cabal
on
the
range
will
supply
the
investigators
with
data
and
facts
that
will
rouse
the
conscience
of
the
community
and
cause
the
dismissal
of
the
warden
and
the
introduction
of
reforms
a
prisoner
about
to
be
discharged
is
selected
for
the
important
mission
of
enlightening
the
press
in
great
anxiety
and
expectation
we
await
the
newspapers
the
day
following
his
liberation
we
scan
the
pages
closely
not
a
word
of
the
penitentiary
probably
the
released
man
has
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
editors
in
the
joy
of
freedom
he
may
have
looked
too
deeply
into
the
cup
that
cheers
he
will
surely
interview
the
papers
the
next
day
but
the
days
pass
into
weeks
without
any
reference
in
the
press
to
the
prison
the
trusted
man
has
failed
us
the
revelation
of
the
life
at
riverside
is
of
a
nature
not
to
be
ignored
by
the
press
the
discharged
inmate
has
proved
false
to
his
promise
bitterly
the
solitaries
denounce
him
and
resolve
to
select
a
more
reliable
man
among
the
first
candidates
for
liberty
one
after
another
a
score
of
men
are
entrusted
with
the
mission
to
the
press
but
the
papers
remain
silent
anxiously
though
every
day
less
hopefully
we
search
their
columns
ryan
cynically
derides
the
faithlessness
of
convict
promises
butch
rages
and
at
the
traitors
but
sloane
is
sternly
confident
in
his
own
probity
and
cheers
me
as
i
pause
at
his
cell
never
min
them
rats
aleck
you
just
wait
till
i
go
out
here
the
boy
that
keep
his
promise
all
right
what
i
wo
do
to
old
sandy
ai
worth
mentionin
why
you
still
have
two
years
ed
i
remind
him
not
on
your
tintype
aleck
only
one
and
a
stump
how
big
is
the
stump
he
chuckles
looking
somewhat
diffident
it
one
year
months
an
days
it
ai
no
two
years
though
see
jimmy
grant
grows
peculiarly
reserved
evidently
disinclined
to
talk
he
seeks
to
avoid
me
the
treachery
of
the
released
men
fills
him
with
resentment
and
suspicion
of
every
one
he
is
impatient
of
my
suggestion
that
the
fault
may
lie
with
a
servile
press
at
the
mention
of
our
plans
he
bursts
out
savagely
forget
it
you
no
good
none
of
you
let
me
be
he
turns
his
back
to
me
and
angrily
paces
the
cell
his
actions
fill
me
with
concern
the
youth
seems
strangely
changed
fortunately
his
time
is
almost
served
ii
like
wildfire
the
news
circles
the
prison
the
papers
are
giving
sandy
hell
the
air
in
the
block
trembles
with
suppressed
excitement
jimmy
grant
recently
released
had
sent
a
communication
to
the
state
board
of
charities
bringing
serious
charges
against
the
management
of
riverside
the
press
publishes
startlingly
significant
excerpts
from
letter
editorially
however
the
indictment
is
ignored
by
the
majority
of
the
pittsburgh
papers
one
writer
comments
ambiguously
in
guarded
language
suggesting
the
improbability
of
the
horrible
practices
alleged
by
grant
another
eulogizes
warden
wright
as
an
intelligent
and
humane
man
who
has
the
interest
of
the
prisoners
at
heart
the
detailed
accusations
are
briefly
dismissed
as
unworthy
of
notice
because
coming
from
a
disgruntled
criminal
who
had
not
found
prison
life
to
his
liking
only
the
and
the
consider
the
matter
seriously
refer
to
the
numerous
complaints
from
discharged
prisoners
and
suggest
the
advisability
of
an
investigation
they
urge
upon
the
warden
the
necessity
of
disproving
once
for
all
the
derogatory
statements
regarding
his
management
within
a
few
days
the
president
of
the
board
of
charities
announces
his
decision
to
look
over
the
penitentiary
december
is
on
the
wane
and
the
board
is
expected
to
visit
riverside
after
the
holidays
iii
of
course
neither
of
you
has
any
more
faith
in
alleged
investigations
than
myself
the
lexow
investigation
which
shocked
the
whole
country
with
its
exposé
of
police
corruption
has
resulted
in
practically
nothing
one
or
two
subordinates
have
been
scapegoated
those
higher
up
went
unscathed
as
usual
the
system
itself
remains
in
the
one
who
has
mostly
profited
by
the
spasm
of
morality
is
goff
to
whom
the
vice
crusade
afforded
an
opportunity
to
rise
from
obscurity
into
the
national
limelight
parkhurst
also
has
subsided
probably
content
with
the
enlarged
size
of
his
flock
and
salary
to
give
the
devil
his
due
however
i
admired
his
perseverance
and
courage
in
face
of
the
storm
of
ridicule
and
scorn
that
met
his
initial
accusations
against
the
glorious
police
department
of
the
metropolis
but
though
every
charge
has
been
proved
in
the
most
absolute
manner
the
situation
as
a
whole
remains
unchanged
it
is
the
history
of
all
investigations
as
the
germans
say
you
ca
convict
the
devil
in
the
court
of
his
it
has
again
been
demonstrated
by
the
congressional
inquiry
into
the
carnegie
armor
plate
in
the
terrible
revelations
regarding
superintendent
brockway
of
the
elmira
reformatory
a
veritable
den
for
maiming
and
killing
and
in
numerous
other
instances
warden
wright
also
was
investigated
about
ten
years
ago
a
double
set
of
books
was
then
found
disclosing
peculation
of
appropriations
and
theft
of
the
prison
product
brutality
and
murder
were
uncovered
yet
sandy
has
remained
in
his
position
we
can
therefore
expect
nothing
from
the
proposed
investigation
by
the
board
of
charities
i
have
no
doubt
it
will
be
a
whitewash
but
i
think
that
we
the
anarchist
trio
should
show
our
solidarity
and
aid
the
inmates
with
our
best
efforts
we
must
prevent
the
investigation
resulting
in
a
farce
so
far
as
evidence
against
the
management
is
concerned
we
should
leave
the
board
no
loophole
no
excuse
of
a
lack
of
witnesses
or
proofs
to
support
grant
charges
i
am
confident
you
will
agree
with
me
in
this
i
am
collecting
data
for
presentation
to
the
investigators
i
am
also
preparing
a
list
of
volunteer
witnesses
i
have
seventeen
numbers
on
my
range
and
others
from
various
parts
of
this
block
and
from
the
shops
they
all
seem
anxious
to
testify
though
i
am
sure
some
will
weaken
when
the
critical
moment
arrives
several
have
already
notified
me
to
erase
their
names
but
we
shall
have
a
sufficient
number
of
witnesses
we
want
preferably
such
men
as
have
personally
suffered
a
clubbing
the
bull
ring
hanging
by
the
wrists
or
other
punishment
forbidden
by
the
law
i
have
already
notified
the
warden
that
i
wish
to
testify
before
the
investigation
committee
my
purpose
was
to
anticipate
his
objection
that
there
are
already
enough
witnesses
i
am
the
first
on
the
list
now
the
completeness
of
the
case
against
the
authorities
will
surprise
you
fortunately
my
position
as
rangeman
has
enabled
me
to
gather
whatever
information
i
needed
i
will
send
you
duplicates
of
the
evidence
to
insure
greater
safety
for
our
material
for
the
present
i
append
a
partial
list

our
exhibits

whiskey
and
dope
dice
playing
cards
cash
money
several
knives
two
razors
postage
stamps

and
other

these
are
for
the
purpose
of
proving
the
warden
a
liar
in
denying
to
the
press
the
existence
of
gambling
in
the
prison
the

it
is

eve
an
air
of
pleasant
anticipation
fills
the
prison
feast
is
the
exciting
subject
of
conversation
roast
beef
will
be
served
for
dinner
with
a
goodly
loaf
of
currant
bread
and
two
cigars
for
dessert
extra
men
have
been
drafted
for
the
kitchen
they
flit
from
block
to
yard
looking
busy
and
important
yet
halting
every
to
whisper
with
secretive
mien
do
say
i
told
you
sweet
potatoes
the
younger
inmates
seem
skeptical
and
strive
to
appear
indifferent
the
while
they
hover
about
the
yard
door
nostrils
expanded
sniffing
the
appetizing
wafts
from
the
kitchen
here
and
there
an
grumbles
we
should
have
had
sweet
murphies
for
christmas
sandy
said
they
sneer
in
ill
humor
the
new
arrivals
grow
uneasy
perhaps
they
are
still
too
expensive
some
study
the
market
quotations
on
the
delicacy
but
the
chief
cook
drops
in
to
visit
his
boy
and
confides
to
the
rangeman
that
the
sweet
potatoes
are
a
sure
thing
just
arrived
and
counted
the
happy
news
is
whispered
about
with
confident
assurance
yet
tinged
with
anxiety
there
is
great
rejoicing
among
the
men
only
sol
the
lifer
is
querulous
he
does
care
a
snap
about
the
extra
feed
stomach
still
sour
from
the
christmas
dinner
and
anyhow
it
only
makes
the
grub
more
disgusting
the
rules
are
somewhat
relaxed
the
hallmen
converse
freely
the
yard
gangs
lounge
about
and
cluster
in
little
groups
that
separate
at
the
approach
of
a
superior
officer
men
from
the
bakery
and
kitchen
run
in
and
out
of
the
block
their
pockets
bulging
suspiciously
what
are
you
after
the
doorkeeper
halts
them
oh
just
to
my
cell
forgot
my
handkerchief
the
guard
answers
the
sly
wink
with
an
indulgent
smile
all
right
go
ahead
but
do
be
long
if
papa

is
about

thunders
at
the

his
bosom
swelling
with
packages
wotch
got
there
eh
big
family
of
kids
have
jim
first
thing
you
know
you
swipe
the
hinges
off
th
kitchen
door
the
envied
bakery
and
kitchen
employees
supply
their
friends
with
extra
holiday
tidbits
and
the
solitaries
dance
in
glee
at
the
sight
of
the
savory
dainty
the
fresh
brown
bread
generously
dotted
with
sweet
currants
it
is
the
prelude
of
the
promised
culinary
symphony
the
evening
is
cheerful
with
mirth
and
jollity
the
prisoners
at
first
converse
in
whispers
then
become
bolder
and
talk
louder
through
the
bars
as
night
approaches
the
rings
with
unreserved
hilarity
and
animation
chaff
mingled
with
coarse
jests
and
droll
humor
a
wag
on
the
upper
tier
banters
the
passing
guards
his
quips
and
sallies
setting
the
adjoining
cells
in
a
roar
and
inspiring
imitation
slowly
the
babel
of
tongues
subsides
as
the
gong
sounds
the
order
to
retire
some
one
shouts
to
a
distant
friend
hey
bill
are
you
there
stay
there
it
grows
quiet
when
suddenly
my
neighbor
on
the
left
fellers
who
goin
to
sit
up
with
me
to
greet
new
year
a
dozen
voices
yell
their
acceptance
little
frenchy
the
spirited
grayhead
on
the
top
tier
vociferates
shrilly
me
too
boys
i
viz
you
all
right
all
is
still
in
the
save
for
a
wild
indian
whoop
now
and
then
by
the
boys
the
block
breathes
in
heavy
sleep
loud
snoring
sounds
from
the
gallery
above
only
the
irregular
tread
of
the
guards
falls
muffled
in
the
silence
the
clock
in
the
upper
rotunda
strikes
the
midnight
hour
a
siren
on
the
ohio
intones
its
bass
another
joins
it
then
another
shrill
factory
whistles
pierce
the
boom
of
cannon
the
sweet
chimes
of
a
nearby
church
ring
in
joyful
melody
between
instantly
the
prison
is
astir
tin
cans
rattle
against
iron
bars
doors
shake
in
fury
beds
and
chairs
squeak
and
screech
pans
slam
on
the
floor
shoes
crash
against
the
walls
with
a
dull
thud
and
rebound
noisily
on
the
stone
unearthly
yelling
shouting
and
whistling
rend
the
air
an
inventive
prisoner
beats
a
wild
tatto
with
a
tin
pan
on
the
table
a
veritable
bedlam
of
frenzy
has
broken
loose
in
both
wings
the
prisoners
are
celebrating
the
advent
of
the
new
year
the
voices
grow
hoarse
and
feeble
the
tin
clanks
languidly
against
the
iron
the
grating
of
the
doors
sounds
weaker
the
men
are
exhausted
with
the
unwonted
effort
the
guards
stumbled
up
the
galleries
their
forms
swaying
unsteadily
in
the
faint
flicker
of
the
gaslight
in
maudlin
tones
they
command
silence
and
bid
the
men
retire
to
bed
the
younger
more
daring
challenge
the
order
with
husky
howls
and
catcalls
a
defiant
shout
a
groan
and
all
is
quiet
daybreak
wakes
the
turmoil
and
uproar
for
hours
the
animal
spirits
are
rampant
no
music
or
recreation
honors
the
new
year
the
day
is
passed
in
the
cell
the
prisoners
securely
barred
and
locked
are
permitted
to
vent
their
pain
and
sorrow
their
yearnings
and
hopes
in
a
saturnalia
of
tumult
ii
the
month
of
january
brings
sedulous
activity
shops
and
block
are
overhauled
every
nook
and
corner
is
scoured
and
a
special
squad
detailed
to
whitewash
the
cells
the
yearly
not
being
due
till
spring
i
conclude
from
the
unusual
preparations
that
the
expected
visit
of
the
board
of
charities
is
approaching
the
prisoners
are
agog
with
the
coming
investigation
the
solitaries
and
prospective
witnesses
are
on
the
anxious
lines
on
their
faces
some
manifest
fear
of
the
ill
will
of
the
warden
as
the
probable
result
of
their
testimony
i
seek
to
encourage
them
by
promising
to
assume
full
responsibility
but
several
men
withdraw
their
previous
consent
the
safety
of
my
data
causes
me
grave
concern
in
view
of
the
increasing
frequency
of
searches
deliberation
finally
resolves
itself
into
the
bold
plan
of
secreting
my
most
valuable
material
in
the
cell
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
officers
it
is
the
first
cell
on
the
range
it
is
never
locked
and
is
ignored
at
searches
because
it
is
not
occupied
by
prisoners
the
little
bundle
protected
with
a
piece
of
oilskin
procured
from
the
dispensary
soon
reposes
in
the
depths
of
the
waste
pipe
a
stout
cord
secures
it
from
being
washed
away
by
the
rush
of
water
when
the
privy
is
in
use
i
call
officer
mitchell
attention
to
the
dusty
condition
of
the
cell
and
offer
to
sweep
it
every
morning
and
afternoon
he
accedes
in
an
offhand
manner
and
twice
daily
i
surreptitiously
examine
the
tension
of
the
cord
renewing
the
string
repeatedly
other
material
and
copies
of
my
exhibits
are
deposited
with
several
trustworthy
friends
on
the
range
everything
is
ready
for
the
investigation
and
we
confidently
await
the
coming
of
the
board
of
charities
iii
the
rejoices
at
the
absence
of
scot
woods
the
block
captain
of
the
morning
has
been
reduced
to
the
ranks
the
disgrace
is
signalized
by
his
appearance
on
the
wall
pacing
the
narrow
path
in
the
chilly
winter
blasts
the
guards
look
upon
the
assignment
as
punishment
duty
for
incurring
the
displeasure
of
the
warden
the
keepers
smile
at
the
indiscreet
scot
interfering
with
the
privileges
of
southside
johnny
one
of
the
warden
favorites
the
runner
who
afforded
me
an
opportunity
to
see
inspector
nevin
came
out
victorious
in
the
struggle
with
woods
the
latter
was
upbraided
by
captain
wright
in
the
presence
of
johnny
who
is
now
officially
authorized
in
his
perquisites
sufficient
time
was
allowed
to
elapse
to
avoid
comment
whereupon
the
officer
was
withdrawn
from
the
block
i
regret
his
absence
a
severe
disciplinarian
woods
was
yet
very
exceptional
among
the
guards
in
that
he
sought
to
discourage
the
spying
of
prisoners
on
each
other
he
frowned
upon
the
trusties
and
strove
to
treat
the
men
impartially
mitchell
has
been
changed
to
the
morning
shift
to
fill
the
vacancy
made
by
the
transfer
of
woods
the
charge
of
the
block
in
the
afternoon
devolves
upon
officer
mcilvaine
a
very
corpulent
man
with
sharp
steely
eyes
he
is
considerably
above
the
average
warder
in
intelligence
but
extremely
fond
of
jasper
who
now
acts
as
his
assistant
the
obese
turnkey
rarely
leaving
his
seat
at
the
front
desk
changes
of
keepers
transfers
from
the
shops
to
the
two
are
frequent
the
new
guards
are
alert
and
active
almost
daily
the
warden
visits
the
ranges
leaving
in
his
wake
more
stringent
discipline
rarely
do
i
find
a
chance
to
pause
at
the
cells
i
keep
in
touch
with
the
men
through
the
medium
of
notes
but
one
day
several
fights
breaking
out
in
the
shops
the
block
officers
are
requisitioned
to
assist
in
placing
the
combatants
in
the
punishment
cells
the
front
is
deserted
and
i
improve
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
solitaries
jasper
southside
and
bob
runyon
the
politicians
also
converse
at
the
doors
bob
standing
suspiciously
close
to
the
bars
suddenly
officer
mcilvaine
appears
in
the
yard
door
his
face
is
flushed
his
eyes
filling
with
wrath
as
they
fasten
on
the
men
at
the
cells
hey
you
fellows
get
away
from
there
he
shouts
confound
you
all
the
man
just
gave
me
the
deuce
too
much
talking
in
the
block
i
wo
stand
for
it
that
all
he
adds
petulantly
within
half
an
hour
i
am
haled
before
the
warden
he
looks
worried
deep
lines
of
anxiety
about
his
mouth
you
are
reported
for
standing
at
the
doors
he
snarls
at
me
what
are
you
always
telling
the
men
it
the
first
time
the
officer
nothing
of
the
kind
he
interrupts
you
always
talking
to
the
prisoners
they
are
in
punishment
and
you
have
no
business
with
them
why
was
picked
out
others
talk
too
he
drawls
sarcastically
then
turning
to
the
keeper
he
says
how
is
that
officer
the
man
is
charging
you
with
neglect
of
duty
i
am
not
charging
silence
what
have
you
to
say
mr
mcilvaine
the
guard
reddens
with
suppressed
rage
it
is
true
captain
he
replies
there
was
no
one
except
berkman
you
hear
what
the
officer
says
you
are
always
breaking
the
rules
you
plotting
i
know
you
pulling
a
dozen
wires
you
are
inimical
to
the
management
of
the
institution
but
i
will
break
your
connections
officers
take
him
directly
to
the
south
wing
you
understand
he
is
not
to
return
to
his
cell
have
it
searched
at
once
thoroughly
lock
him
up
warden
what
for
i
demand
i
have
not
done
anything
to
lose
my
position
talking
is
not
such
a
serious
charge
very
serious
very
serious
you
too
dangerous
on
the
range
spoil
your
infernal
schemes
by
removing
you
from
the
north
block
been
there
too
long
i
want
to
remain
there
the
more
reason
to
take
you
away
that
will
do
now
no
it
wo
i
burst
out
i
stay
where
i
am
remove
him
mr
mcilvaine
i
am
taken
to
the
south
wing
and
locked
up
in
a
vacant
cell
neglected
and
it
is
number
range
m
the
first
gallery
facing
the
yard
a
double
cell
somewhat
larger
than
those
of
the
north
block
and
containing
a
small
window
the
walls
are
damp
and
bare
save
for
the
cardboard
of
printed
rules
and
the
prison
calendar
it
is
the
of
february
but
the
calendar
is
of
last
year
indicating
that
the
cell
has
not
been
occupied
since
the
previous
november
it
contains
the
usual
furnishings
bedstead
and
soiled
straw
mattress
a
small
table
and
a
chair
it
feels
cold
and
dreary
in
thought
i
picture
the
guards
ransacking
my
former
cell
they
will
not
discover
anything
my
material
is
well
hidden
the
warden
evidently
suspects
my
plans
he
fears
my
testimony
before
the
investigation
committee
my
removal
is
to
sever
my
connections
and
now
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
reach
my
data
i
must
return
to
the
north
block
otherwise
all
our
plans
are
doomed
to
fail
i
ca
leave
my
friends
on
the
range
in
the
lurch
some
of
them
have
already
signified
to
the
chaplain
their
desire
to
testify
their
statements
will
remain
unsupported
in
the
absence
of
my
proofs
i
must
rejoin
them
i
have
told
the
warden
that
i
shall
remain
where
i
was
but
he
probably
ignored
it
as
an
empty
boast
i
consider
the
situation
and
resolve
to
break
up
housekeeping
it
is
the
sole
means
of
being
transferred
to
the
other
it
will
involve
the
loss
of
the
grade
and
a
trip
to
the
dungeon
perhaps
even
a
fight
with
the
keepers
the
guards
fearing
the
broken
furniture
will
be
used
for
defence
generally
rush
the
prisoner
with
blackjacks
but
my
return
to
the
north
wing
will
be
assured
no
man
in
stripes
can
remain
in
the
south
wing
alert
for
an
approaching
step
i
untie
my
shoes
producing
a
scrap
of
paper
a
pencil
and
a
knife
i
write
a
hurried
note
to
k
briefly
informing
him
of
the
new
developments
and
intimating
that
our
data
are
safe
guardedly
i
attract
the
attention
of
the
runner
on
the
floor
beneath
it
is
bill
say
through
whom
carl
occasionally
communicates
with
the
note
rolled
into
a
little
ball
i
shoot
between
the
bars
to
the
waiting
prisoner
now
everything
is
prepared
it
is
near
supper
time
the
men
are
coming
back
from
work
it
would
be
advisable
to
wait
till
everybody
is
locked
in
and
the
shop
officers
depart
home
there
will
then
be
only
three
guards
on
duty
in
the
block
but
i
am
in
a
fever
of
indignation
and
anger
furiously
snatching
up
the
chair
i
start
breaking
up
chapter
xxvii
love
dungeon
flower
the
dungeon
smells
foul
and
musty
the
darkness
is
almost
visible
the
silence
oppressive
but
the
terror
of
my
former
experience
has
abated
i
shall
probably
be
kept
in
the
underground
cell
for
a
longer
time
than
on
the
previous
occasion
my
offence
is
considered
very
grave
three
charges
have
been
entered
against
me
destroying
state
property
having
possession
of
a
knife
and
uttering
a
threat
against
the
warden
when
i
saw
the
officers
gathering
at
my
back
while
i
was
facing
the
captain
i
realized
its
significance
they
were
preparing
to
assault
me
quickly
advancing
to
the
warden
i
shook
my
fist
in
his
face
crying
if
they
touch
me
i
hold
you
personally
responsible
he
turned
pale
trying
to
steady
his
voice
he
demanded
what
do
you
mean
how
dare
you
i
mean
just
what
i
say
i
wo
be
clubbed
my
friends
will
avenge
me
too
he
glanced
at
the
guards
standing
rigid
in
ominous
silence
one
by
one
they
retired
only
two
remaining
and
i
was
taken
quietly
to
the
dungeon
the
stillness
is
broken
by
a
low
muffled
sound
i
listen
intently
it
is
some
one
pacing
the
cell
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
halloo
who
there
i
shout
no
reply
the
pacing
continues
it
must
be
silent
nick
he
never
talks
i
prepare
to
pass
the
night
on
the
floor
it
is
bare
there
is
no
bed
or
blanket
and
i
have
been
deprived
of
my
coat
and
shoes
it
is
freezing
in
the
cell
my
feet
grow
numb
hands
cold
as
i
huddle
in
the
corner
my
head
leaning
against
the
reeking
wall
my
body
on
the
stone
floor
i
try
to
think
but
my
thoughts
are
wandering
my
brain
frigid
the
rattling
of
keys
wakes
me
from
my
stupor
guards
are
descending
into
the
dungeon
i
wonder
whether
it
is
morning
but
they
pass
my
cell
it
is
not
yet
breakfast
time
now
they
pause
and
whisper
i
recognize
the
mumbling
speech
of
deputy
greaves
as
he
calls
out
to
the
silent
prisoner
want
a
drink
the
double
doors
open
noisily
here
give
me
the
cup
the
hoarse
bass
resembles
that
of
crazy
smithy
his
stentorian
voice
sounds
cracked
since
he
was
shot
in
the
neck
by
officer
dean
you
ca
have
th
cup
the
deputy
fumes
i
wo
drink
out
of
your
hand
god
damn
you
think
i
a
cur
do
you
smithy
swears
and
curses
savagely
the
doors
are
slammed
and
locked
the
steps
grow
faint
and
all
is
silent
save
the
quickened
footfall
of
smith
who
will
not
talk
to
any
prisoner
i
pass
the
long
night
in
drowsy
stupor
rousing
at
times
to
strain
my
ear
for
every
sound
from
the
rotunda
above
wondering
whether
day
is
breaking
the
minutes
drag
in
dismal
darkness
the
loud
clanking
of
the
keys
tingles
in
my
ears
like
sweet
music
it
is
morning
the
guards
hand
me
the
day
allowance
two
ounces
of
white
bread
and
a
quart
of
water
the
wheat
tastes
sweet
it
seems
to
me
never
eaten
anything
so
delectable
but
the
liquid
is
insipid
and
nauseates
me
at
almost
one
bite
i
swallow
the
slice
so
small
and
thin
it
whets
my
appetite
and
i
feel
ravenously
hungry
at
smith
door
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
is
repeated
the
deputy
insists
that
the
man
drink
out
of
the
cup
held
by
a
guard
the
prisoner
refuses
with
a
profuse
flow
of
profanity
suddenly
there
is
a
splash
followed
by
a
startled
cry
and
the
thud
of
the
cell
bucket
on
the
floor
smith
has
emptied
the
contents
of
his
privy
upon
the
officers
in
confusion
they
rush
out
of
the
dungeon
presently
i
hear
the
clatter
of
many
feet
in
the
cellar
there
is
a
hubbub
of
suppressed
voices
i
recognize
the
rasping
whisper
of
hopkins
the
tones
of
woods
mcilvaine
and
others
i
catch
the
words
both
sides
at
once
several
cells
in
the
dungeon
are
provided
with
double
entrances
front
and
back
to
facilitate
attacks
upon
obstreperous
prisoners
smith
is
always
assigned
to
one
of
these
cells
i
shudder
as
i
realize
that
the
officers
are
preparing
to
club
the
demented
man
he
has
been
weakened
by
years
of
unbroken
solitary
confinement
and
his
throat
still
bleeds
occasionally
from
the
bullet
wound
almost
half
his
time
he
has
been
kept
in
the
dungeon
and
now
he
has
been
missing
from
the
range
twelve
days
it
is
involuntarily
i
shut
my
eyes
at
the
fearful
thud
of
the
riot
clubs
the
hours
drag
on
the
monotony
is
broken
by
the
keepers
bringing
another
prisoner
to
the
dungeon
i
hear
his
violent
sobbing
from
the
depth
of
the
cavern
who
is
there
i
hail
him
i
call
repeatedly
without
receiving
an
answer
perhaps
the
new
arrival
is
afraid
of
listening
guards
ho
man
i
sing
out
the
screws
have
gone
who
are
you
this
is
aleck
aleck
berkman
is
that
you
aleck
this
is
johnny
there
is
a
familiar
ring
about
the
young
voice
broken
by
piteous
moans
but
i
fail
to
identify
it
what
johnny
johnny
davis
you
know
stocking
shop
i
just
killed
a
man
in
bewilderment
i
listen
to
the
story
told
with
bursts
of
weeping
johnny
had
returned
to
the
shop
he
thought
he
would
try
again
he
wanted
to
earn
his
good
time
things
went
well
for
a
while
till
dutch
adams
became
shop
runner
he
is
the
stool
who
got
grant
and
johnny
smith
in
trouble
with
the
fake
key
and
davis
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
but
dutch
persisted
pestering
him
all
the
time
and
then
well
you
know
aleck
the
boy
seems
diffident
he
lied
about
me
like
hell
he
told
the
fellows
he
me
christ
my
mother
might
hear
about
it
i
could
stand
it
aleck
honest
to
god
i
could
i
i
killed
the
lying
cur
an
now
now
i
i
swing
for
it
he
sobs
as
if
his
heart
would
break
a
touch
of
tenderness
for
the
poor
boy
is
in
my
voice
as
i
strive
to
condole
with
him
and
utter
the
hope
that
it
may
not
be
so
bad
after
all
perhaps
adams
will
not
die
he
is
a
powerful
man
big
and
strong
he
may
survive
johnny
eagerly
clutches
at
the
straw
he
grows
more
cheerful
and
we
talk
of
the
coming
investigation
and
local
affairs
perhaps
the
board
will
even
clear
him
he
suggests
but
suddenly
seized
with
fear
he
weeps
and
moans
again
more
men
are
cast
into
the
dungeon
they
bring
news
from
the
world
above
an
epidemic
of
fighting
seems
to
have
broken
out
in
the
wake
of
recent
orders
the
total
inhibition
of
talking
is
resulting
in
more
serious
offences
kid
tommy
is
enlarging
upon
his
trouble
you
see
fellers
he
cries
in
a
treble
dat
skunk
of
a
pete
he

in
de

johnny
interrupts
the
loquacious
boy
to
inquire
anxiously
about
dutch
adams
and
i
share
his
joy
at
hearing
that
the
man
wound
is
not
serious
he
was
cut
about
the
shoulders
but
was
able
to
walk
unassisted
to
the
hospital
johnny
overflows
with
quiet
happiness
the
others
dance
and
sing
i
recite
a
poem
from
nekrassov
the
boys
do
understand
a
word
but
the
tones
appeal
to
them
and
they
request
more
russian
pieces
but
tommy
is
more
interested
in
politics
and
is
bristling
with
the
latest
news
from
the
magee
camp
he
is
a
great
admirer
of
quay
dere
a
smart
guy
fer
you

he
give
sixteen
dollars
to
every
one
he
will
nit
and
the
boys
are
soon
involved
in
a
heated
discussion
of
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
political
parties
tommy
staunchly
siding
with
the
republican
me
and
me
fader
was
republicans
he
vociferates
an
all
me
broders
vote
de
ticket
me
fer
de
gran
ole
party
time
some
one
twits
him
on
his
political
wisdom
challenging
the
boy
to
explain
the
difference
in
the
money
standards
tommy
boldly
appeals
to
me
to
corroborate
him
but
before
i
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
he
launches
upon
other
issues
berating
spain
for
her
atrocities
in
cuba
and
insisting
that
this
free
country
can
not
tolerate
slavery
at
its
doors
every
topic
is
discussed
with
tommy
orating
at
top
speed
and
continually
broaching
new
subjects
unexpectedly
he
reverts
to
local
affairs
waxes
reminiscent
over
former
days
and
loudly
smacks
his
lips
at
the
great
feeds
he
enjoyed
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
was
free
to
roam
the
back
streets
of
smoky
city
say
aleck
my
boy
he
calls
to
me
familiarly
many
a
penny
i
made
on
all
right
how
why
peddlin
extras
of
course
say
dem
was
fine
days
all
right
easy
money
papers
went
like
hot
cakes
off
the
griddle
wish
you
do
it
again
aleck
invisible
to
each
other
we
chat
exchange
stories
and
anecdotes
the
boys
talking
incessantly
as
if
fearful
of
silence
but
every
now
and
then
there
is
a
lull
we
become
quiet
each
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
the
pauses
lengthen
lengthen
into
silence
only
the
faint
steps
of
crazy
smith
disturb
the
deep
stillness
late
in
the
evening
the
young
prisoners
are
relieved
but
johnny
remains
and
his
apprehensions
reawaken
repeatedly
during
the
night
he
rouses
me
from
my
drowsy
torpor
to
be
reassured
that
he
is
not
in
danger
of
the
gallows
and
that
he
will
not
be
tried
for
his
assault
i
allay
his
fears
by
dwelling
on
the
warden
aversion
to
giving
publicity
to
the
sex
practices
in
the
prison
and
remind
the
boy
of
the
official
denial
of
their
existence
these
things
happen
almost
every
week
yet
no
one
has
ever
been
taken
to
court
from
riverside
on
such
charges
johnny
grows
more
tranquil
and
we
converse
about
his
family
history
talking
in
a
frank
confidential
manner
with
a
glow
of
pleasure
i
become
aware
of
the
note
of
tenderness
in
his
voice
presently
he
surprises
me
by
asking
friend
aleck
what
do
they
call
you
in
russian
he
prefers
the
fond
sashenka
enunciating
the
strange
word
with
quaint
endearment
then
diffidently
confesses
dislike
for
his
own
name
and
relates
the
story
he
had
recently
read
of
a
poor
castaway
cuban
youth
felipe
was
his
name
and
he
was
just
like
himself
shall
i
call
you
felipe
i
offer
yes
please
do
aleck
dear
no
sashenka
the
springs
of
affection
well
up
within
me
as
i
lie
huddled
on
the
stone
floor
cold
and
hungry
with
closed
eyes
i
picture
the
boy
before
me
with
his
delicate
face
and
sensitive
girlish
lips
good
night
dear
sashenka
he
calls
good
night
little
felipe
in
the
morning
we
are
served
with
a
slice
of
bread
and
water
i
am
tormented
with
thirst
and
hunger
and
the
small
ration
fails
to
assuage
my
sharp
pangs
smithy
still
refuses
to
drink
out
of
the
deputy
hand
his
doors
remain
unopened
with
tremulous
anxiety
johnny
begs
the
deputy
warden
to
tell
him
how
much
longer
he
will
remain
in
the
dungeon
but
greaves
curtly
commands
silence
applying
a
vile
epithet
to
the
boy
deputy
i
call
boiling
over
with
indignation
he
asked
you
a
respectful
question
i
give
him
a
decent
answer
you
mind
your
own
business
you
hear
he
retorts
but
i
persist
in
defending
my
young
friend
and
berate
the
deputy
for
his
language
he
hastens
away
in
a
towering
passion
menacing
me
with
what
smithy
got
johnny
is
distressed
at
being
the
innocent
cause
of
the
trouble
the
threat
of
the
deputy
disquiets
him
and
he
warns
me
to
prepare
my
cell
is
provided
with
a
double
entrance
and
i
am
apprehensive
of
a
sudden
attack
but
the
hours
pass
without
the
deputy
returning
and
our
fears
are
allayed
the
boy
rejoices
on
my
account
and
brims
over
with
appreciation
of
my
intercession
the
incident
cements
our
intimacy
our
first
diffidence
disappears
and
we
become
openly
tender
and
affectionate
the
conversation
lags
we
feel
weak
and
worn
but
every
little
while
we
hail
each
other
with
words
of
encouragement
smithy
incessantly
paces
the
cell
the
gnawing
of
the
river
rats
reaches
our
ears
the
silence
is
frequently
pierced
by
the
wild
yells
of
the
insane
man
startling
us
with
dread
foreboding
the
quiet
grows
unbearable
and
johnny
calls
again

in
the
evening
the
guards
descend
to
relieve
johnny
he
is
to
be
transferred
to
the
basket
they
inform
him
on
the
way
past
my
cell
he
whispers
hope
i
see
you
soon
sashenka
a
friendly
officer
knocks
on
the
outer
blind
door
of
my
cell
that
you
thar
berkman
you
want
to
to
th
he
put
you
down
for
two
more
days
for
him
i
feel
more
lonesome
at
the
boy
departure
the
silence
grows
more
oppressive
the
hours
of
darkness
heavier
seven
days
i
remain
in
the
dungeon
at
the
expiration
of
the
week
feeling
stiff
and
feeble
i
totter
behind
the
guards
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
my
body
looks
strangely
emaciated
reduced
almost
to
a
skeleton
the
pangs
of
hunger
revive
sharply
with
the
shock
of
the
cold
shower
and
the
craving
for
tobacco
is
overpowering
at
the
sight
of
the
chewing
officers
i
look
forward
to
being
placed
in
a
cell
quietly
exulting
at
my
victory
as
i
am
led
to
the
north
wing
but
in
the
the
deputy
warden
assigns
me
to
the
lower
end
of
range
a
insane
department
exasperated
by
the
terrible
suggestion
my
nerves
on
edge
with
the
dungeon
experience
i
storm
in
furious
protest
demanding
to
be
returned
to
the
hole
the
deputy
startled
by
my
violence
attempts
to
soothe
me
and
finally
yields
i
am
placed
in
number
the
crank
row
beginning
several
cells
further
upon
the
heels
of
the
departing
officers
the
rangeman
is
at
my
door
bursting
with
the
latest
news
the
investigation
is
over
the
warden
whitewashed
for
an
instant
i
am
aghast
failing
to
grasp
the
astounding
situation
slowly
its
full
significance
dawns
on
me
as
bill
excitedly
relates
the
story
it
the
talk
of
the
prison
the
board
of
charities
had
chosen
its
secretary
francis
torrance
an
intimate
friend
of
the
warden
to
conduct
the
investigation
as
a
precautionary
measure
i
was
kept
several
additional
days
in
the
dungeon
torrance
has
privately
interviewed
dutch
adams
young
smithy
and
bob
runyon
promising
them
their
full
commutation
time
notwithstanding
their
bad
records
and
irrespective
of
their
future
behavior
they
were
instructed
by
the
secretary
to
corroborate
the
management
placing
all
blame
upon
me
no
other
witnesses
were
heard
the
investigation
was
over
within
an
hour
the
committee
of
one
retiring
for
dinner
to
the
adjoining
residence
of
the
warden
several
friendly
prisoners
linger
at
my
cell
during
the
afternoon
corroborating
the
story
of
the
rangeman
and
completing
the
details
the
itself
bears
out
the
situation
the
change
in
the
personnel
of
the
men
is
amazing
dutch
adams
has
been
promoted
to
messenger
for
the
front
office
the
most
privileged
political
job
in
the
prison
bob
runyon
a
and
notorious
kid
man
has
been
appointed
a
trusty
in
the
shops
but
the
most
significant
cue
is
the
advancement
of
young
smithy
to
the
position
of
rangeman
he
has
but
recently
been
sentenced
to
a
year
solitary
for
the
broken
key
discovered
in
the
lock
of
his
door
his
record
is
of
the
worst
he
is
a
young
convict
of
extremely
violent
temper
who
has
repeatedly
attacked
with
dangerous
weapons
since
his
murderous
assault
upon
the
inoffensive
praying
andy
smithy
was
never
permitted
out
of
his
cell
without
the
escort
of
two
guards
and
now
this
irresponsible
man
is
in
charge
of
a
range
at
supper
young
smithy
steals
up
to
my
cell
bringing
a
slice
of
cornbread
i
refuse
the
peace
offering
and
charge
him
with
treachery
at
first
he
stoutly
protests
his
innocence
but
gradually
weakens
and
pleads
his
dire
straits
in
mitigation
torrance
had
persuaded
him
to
testify
but
he
avoided
incriminating
me
that
was
done
by
the
other
two
witnesses
he
merely
exonerated
the
warden
from
the
charges
preferred
by
james
grant
he
had
been
clubbed
four
times
but
he
denied
to
the
committee
that
the
guards
practice
violence
and
he
supported
the
warden
in
his
statement
that
the
officers
are
not
permitted
to
carry
clubs
or
blackjacks
he
feels
that
an
injustice
has
been
done
me
and
now
that
he
occupies
my
former
position
he
will
be
able
to
repay
the
little
favors
i
did
him
when
he
was
in
solitary
indignantly
i
spurn
his
offer
he
pleads
his
youth
the
torture
of
the
cell
and
begs
my
forgiveness
but
i
am
bitter
at
his
treachery
and
bid
him
go
officer
mcilvaine
pauses
at
my
door
oh
what
a
change
what
an
awful
change
he
exclaims
pityingly
i
do
know
whether
he
refers
to
my
appearance
or
to
the
loss
of
range
liberty
but
i
resent
his
tone
of
commiseration
it
was
he
who
had
selected
me
as
a
victim
to
be
reported
for
talking
angrily
i
turn
my
back
to
him
refusing
to
talk
somebody
stealthily
pushes
a
bundle
of
newspapers
between
the
bars
whole
columns
detail
the
report
of
the
investigation
completely
exonerating
warden
edward
wright
the
base
charges
against
the
management
of
the
penitentiary
were
the
underhand
work
of
anarchist
berkman
torrance
assured
the
press
one
of
the
papers
contains
a
lengthy
interview
with
wright
accusing
me
of
fostering
discontent
and
insubordination
among
the
men
the
captain
expresses
grave
fear
for
the
safety
of
the
community
should
the
pardon
board
reduce
my
sentence
in
view
of
the
circumstance
that
my
lawyers
are
preparing
to
renew
the
application
at
the
next
session
in
great
agitation
i
pace
the
cell
the
statement
of
the
warden
is
fatal
to
the
hope
of
a
pardon
my
life
in
the
prison
will
now
be
made
still
more
unbearable
i
shall
again
be
locked
in
solitary
with
despair
i
think
of
my
fate
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
the
sense
of
my
utter
helplessness
overpowers
me
chapter
xxviii
for
safety
dear
i
know
you
must
have
been
worried
about
me
give
no
credence
to
the
reports
you
hear
i
did
not
try
to
suicide
i
was
very
nervous
and
excited
over
the
things
that
happened
while
i
was
in
the
dungeon
i
saw
the
papers
after
i
came
up
you
know
what
they
said
i
could
sleep
i
kept
pacing
the
floor
the
screws
were
hanging
about
my
cell
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
them
they
spoke
to
me
but
i
would
answer
i
was
in
no
mood
for
talking
they
must
have
thought
something
wrong
with
me
the
doctor
came
and
felt
my
pulse
and
they
took
me
to
the
hospital
the
warden
rushed
in
and
ordered
me
into
a
for
safety
he
said
you
know
officer
erwin
he
put
the
jacket
on
me
he
a
pretty
decent
chap
i
saw
he
hated
to
do
it
but
the
evening
screw
is
a
rat
he
called
three
times
during
the
night
and
every
time
tighten
the
straps
i
thought
he
cut
my
hands
off
but
i
would
cry
for
mercy
and
that
made
him
wild
they
put
me
in
the
full
size
jacket
that
winds
all
around
you
the
arms
folded
they
laid
me
tied
in
the
canvas
on
the
bed
bound
me
to
it
feet
and
chest
with
straps
provided
with
padlocks
i
was
suffocating
in
the
hot
ward
could
hardly
breathe
in
the
morning
they
unbound
me
my
legs
were
paralyzed
and
i
could
not
stand
up
the
doctor
ordered
some
medicine
for
me
the
head
nurse
he
in
for
murder
and
he
rotten
taunted
me
with
the
black
bottle
every
time
he
passed
my
bed
he
say
you
still
alive
wait
till
i
fix
something
up
for
you
i
refused
the
medicine
and
then
they
took
me
down
to
the
dispensary
lashed
me
to
a
chair
and
used
the
pump
on
me
you
can
imagine
how
i
felt
that
went
on
for
a
week
every
night
in
the
every
morning
the
pump
now
i
am
back
in
the
block
in
a
a
peculiar
coincidence
it
the
same
cell
i
occupied
when
i
first
came
here
do
trust
bill
say
the
warden
told
me
he
knew
about
the
note
i
sent
you
just
before
i
smashed
up
if
you
got
it
bill
must
have
read
it
and
told
sandy
only
dear
old
horsethief
can
be
relied
upon
how
near
the
boundary
of
joy
is
misery
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
morning
in
the
jacket
i
passed
a
restless
night
but
just
as
it
began
to
dawn
i
must
have
lost
consciousness
suddenly
i
awoke
with
the
most
exquisite
music
in
my
ears
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
heavens
had
opened
in
a
burst
of
ecstasy
it
was
only
a
little
sparrow
but
never
before
in
my
life
did
i
hear
such
sweet
melody
i
felt
murder
in
my
heart
when
the
convict
nurse
drove
the
poor
birdie
from
the
window
ledge
a
chapter
xxix
dreams
of
freedom
i
like
an
endless
are
the
days
in
the
solitary
no
glimmer
of
light
cheers
the
in
the
depths
of
suffering
existence
becomes
intolerable
and
as
of
old
i
seek
refuge
in
the
past
the
stages
of
my
life
reappear
as
the
acts
of
a
drama
which
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
cut
short
the
possibilities
of
the
dark
motive
compel
the
imagination
and
halt
the
thought
of
destruction
misery
magnifies
the
estimate
of
self
the
vehemence
of
revolt
strengthens
to
endure
despair
engenders
obstinate
resistance
in
its
spirit
hope
is
trembling
slowly
it
assumes
more
definite
shape
escape
is
the
sole
salvation
the
world
of
the
living
is
dim
and
unreal
with
distance
its
voice
reaches
me
like
the
pale
echo
of
fantasy
the
thought
of
its
turbulent
vitality
is
strange
with
apprehension
but
the
present
is
bitter
with
wretchedness
and
gasps
desperately
for
relief
the
efforts
of
my
friends
bring
a
glow
of
warmth
into
my
life
the
indefatigable
girl
has
succeeded
in
interesting
various
circles
she
is
gathering
funds
for
my
application
for
a
rehearing
before
the
pardon
board
in
the
spring
of
when
my
first
sentence
of
seven
years
will
have
expired
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
i
think
of
her
loyalty
her
indomitable
perseverance
in
my
behalf
it
is
she
almost
she
alone
who
has
kept
my
memory
green
throughout
the
long
years
even
fedya
my
constant
chum
has
been
swirled
into
the
vortex
of
narrow
ambition
and
the
plaything
of
commonplace
fate
resentment
at
being
thus
lightly
forgotten
tinges
my
thoughts
of
the
erstwhile
twin
brother
of
our
youth
by
contrast
the
girl
is
silhouetted
on
my
horizon
as
the
sole
personification
of
revolutionary
persistence
the
earnest
of
its
realization
beyond
all
is
darkness
the
mystic
world
of
falsehood
and
sham
that
will
hate
and
persecute
me
even
as
its
brutal
high
priests
in
the
prison
here
and
there
the
gloom
is
rent
an
unknown
sympathizer
or
comrade
sends
a
greeting
i
pore
eagerly
over
the
chirography
and
from
the
clear
decisive
signature
voltairine
de
cleyre
strive
to
mold
the
character
and
shape
the
features
of
the
writer
to
the
girl
i
apply
to
verify
my
reading
and
rejoice
in
the
warm
interest
of
the
american
a
friend
of
my
comrade
dyer
lum
who
is
aiding
the
girl
in
my
behalf
but
the
efforts
for
a
rehearing
wake
no
hope
in
my
heart
my
comrades
far
from
the
prison
world
do
not
comprehend
the
full
significance
of
the
situation
resulting
from
the
investigation
my
underground
connections
are
paralyzed
i
can
not
enlighten
the
girl
but
nold
and
bauer
are
on
the
threshold
of
liberty
within
two
months
carl
will
carry
my
message
to
new
york
i
can
fully
rely
on
his
discretion
and
devotion
we
have
grown
very
intimate
through
common
suffering
he
will
inform
the
girl
that
nothing
is
to
be
expected
from
legal
procedure
instead
he
will
explain
to
her
the
plan
i
have
evolved
my
position
as
rangeman
has
served
me
to
good
advantage
i
have
thoroughly
familiarized
myself
with
the
institution
i
have
gathered
information
and
explored
every
part
of
the
offering
the
least
likelihood
of
an
escape
the
prison
is
almost
impregnable
tom
attempt
to
scale
the
wall
proved
disastrous
in
spite
of
his
exceptional
opportunities
as
kitchen
employee
and
the
thick
fog
of
the
early
morning
several
other
attempts
also
were
doomed
to
failure
the
great
number
of
guards
and
their
vigilance
precluding
success
no
escape
has
taken
place
since
the
days
of
paddy
mcgraw
before
the
completion
of
the
prison
entirely
new
methods
must
be
tried
the
road
to
freedom
leads
underground
but
digging
of
the
prison
is
impracticable
in
the
modern
structure
of
steel
and
rock
we
must
force
a
passage
the
prison
the
tunnel
is
to
be
dug
from
the
outside
a
house
is
to
be
rented
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
penitentiary
and
the
underground
passage
excavated
beneath
the
eastern
wall
toward
the
adjacent
no
officers
frequent
the
place
save
at
certain
hours
and
i
shall
find
an
opportunity
to
disappear
into
the
hidden
opening
on
the
regular
biweekly
occasions
when
the
solitaries
are
permitted
to
bathe
the
project
will
require
careful
preparation
and
considerable
expense
skilled
comrades
will
have
to
be
entrusted
with
the
secret
work
the
greater
part
of
which
must
be
carried
on
at
night
determination
and
courage
will
make
the
plan
feasible
successful
such
things
have
been
done
before
not
in
this
country
it
is
true
but
the
act
will
receive
added
significance
from
the
circumstance
that
the
liberation
of
the
first
american
political
prisoner
has
been
accomplished
by
means
similar
to
those
practised
by
our
comrades
in
russia
who
knows
it
may
prove
the
symbol
and
precursor
of
russian
idealism
on
american
soil
and
what
tremendous
impression
the
consummation
of
the
bold
plan
will
make
what
a
stimulus
to
our
propaganda
as
a
demonstration
of
anarchist
initiative
and
ability
i
glow
with
the
excitement
of
its
great
possibilities
and
enthuse
carl
with
my
hopes
if
the
preparatory
work
is
hastened
the
execution
of
the
plan
will
be
facilitated
by
the
renewed
agitation
within
the
prison
rumors
of
a
legislative
investigation
are
afloat
diverting
the
thoughts
of
the
administration
into
different
channels
i
shall
foster
the
ferment
to
afford
my
comrades
greater
safety
in
the
work
during
the
long
years
of
my
penitentiary
life
i
have
formed
many
friendships
i
have
earned
the
reputation
of
a
square
man
and
a
good
fellow
have
received
many
proofs
of
confidence
and
appreciation
of
my
uncompromising
attitude
toward
the
generally
execrated
management
most
of
my
friends
observe
the
unwritten
ethics
of
informing
me
of
their
approaching
release
and
offer
to
smuggle
out
messages
or
to
provide
me
with
little
comforts
i
invariably
request
them
to
visit
the
newspapers
and
to
relate
their
experiences
in
riverside
some
express
fear
of
the
warden
enmity
of
the
fatal
consequences
in
case
of
their
return
to
the

but
the
bolder
spirits

the
accidental
offenders
who
confidently
bid
me
a
final
unafraid
of
return
call
directly
from
the
prison

pittsburgh
editors
presently
the
and
the
begin
to
voice
their
censure
of
the
hurried
whitewash
by
the
state
board
of
charities
the
attitude
of
the
press
encourages
the
guards
to
manifest
their
discontent
with
the
humiliating
eccentricities
of
the
senile
warden
they
protest
against
the
whim
subjecting
them
to
military
drill
to
improve
their
appearance
and
resent
captain
wright
insistence
that
they
patronize
his
private
tailor
and
incompetent
serious
friction
has
also
arisen
between
the
management
and
sawhill
superintendent
of
local
industries
the
prisoners
rejoice
at
the
growing
irascibility
of
the
warden
and
the
deeper
lines
on
his
face
interpreting
them
as
signs
of
worry
and
fear
expectation
of
a
new
investigation
is
at
high
pitch
as
judge
gordon
of
philadelphia
severely
censures
the
administration
of
the
eastern
penitentiary
charging
inhuman
treatment
abuse
of
the
insane
and
graft
the
labor
bodies
of
the
state
demand
the
abolition
of
convict
competition
and
the
press
becomes
more
assertive
in
urging
an
investigation
of
both
penitentiaries
the
air
is
charged
with
rumors
of
legislative
action
ii
the
breath
of
spring
is
in
the
my
two
comrades
are
jubilant
the
sweet
odor
of
may
wafts
the
resurrection
but
the
threshold
of
life
is
guarded
by
the
throes
of
new
birth
a
tone
of
nervous
excitement
permeates
their
correspondence
anxiety
tortures
the
sleepless
nights
the
approaching
return
to
the
living
is
tinged
with
the
disquietude
of
the
unknown
the
dread
of
the
renewed
struggle
for
existence
but
the
joy
of
coming
emancipation
the
wine
of
sunshine
and
liberty
tingles
in
every
fiber
and
hope
flutters
its
disused
wings
our
plans
are
complete
carl

my
project
and
serve
as
the

by
means
of
our
prearranged
system
investing
apparently
innocent
official

initial
steps
will
require
time
meanwhile
k
and
g
are
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
the
publication
of
our
book
the
security
of
our
manuscripts
is
a
source
of
deep
satisfaction
and
much
merriment
at
the
expense
of
the
administration
the
repeated
searches
have
failed
to
unearth
them
with
characteristic
daring
the
faithful
bob
had
secreted
them
in
a
hole
in
the
floor
of
his
shop
almost
under
the
very
seat
of
the
guard
one
by
one
they
have
been
smuggled
outside
by
a
friendly
officer
whom
we
have
christened
schraube
by
degrees
nold
has
gained
the
confidence
of
the
former
with
the
result
that
sixty
precious
booklets
now
repose
safely
with
a
comrade
in
allegheny
i
am
to
supply
the
final
chapters
of
the
book
through
schraube
whose
friendship
carl
is
about
to
bequeath
to
me
german
for
screw
the
month
of
may
is
on
the
wane
the
last
note
is
exchanged
with
my
comrades
dear
bob
was
not
able
to
reach
me
in
the
morning
and
now
i
read
the
lines
quivering
with
the
last
pangs
of
release
while
nold
and
bauer
are
already
beyond
the
walls
how
i
yearned
for
a
glance
at
carl
to
touch
hands
even
in
silence
but
the
customary
privilege
was
refused
us
only
once
in
the
long
years
of
our
common
suffering
have
i
looked
into
the
eyes
of
my
devoted
friend
and
stealthily
pressed
his
hand
like
a
thief
in
the
night
no
last
greeting
was
vouchsafed
me
the
loneliness
seems
heavier
the
void
more
painful
the
routine
is
violently
disturbed
reading
and
study
are
burdensome
my
thoughts
will
not
be
compelled
they
revert
obstinately
to
my
comrades
and
storm
against
my
steel
cage
trying
to
pierce
the
distance
to
commune
with
the
absent
i
seek
diversion
in
the
manufacture
of
prison
fancy
work
ornamental
little
fruit
baskets
diminutive
articles
of
furniture
picture
frames
and
the
like
the
little
momentos
constructed
of
rolls
of
various
design
i
send
to
the
girl
and
am
elated
at
her
admiration
of
the
beautiful
workmanship
and
attractive
color
effects
but
presently
she
laments
the
wrecked
condition
of
the
goods
and
upon
investigation
i
learn
from
the
runner
that
the
most
dilapidated
cardboard
boxes
are
selected
for
my
product
the
rotunda
turnkey
in
charge
of
the
shipments
is
hostile
and
i
appeal
to
the
chaplain
but
his
intercession
results
in
an
order
from
the
warden
interdicting
the
expressage
of
my
work
on
the
ground
of
probable
notes
being
secreted
therein
i
protest
against
the
discrimination
suggesting
the
dismembering
of
every
piece
to
disprove
the
charge
but
the
captain
derisively
remarks
that
he
is
indisposed
to
take
chances
and
i
am
forced
to
resort
to
the
subterfuge
of
having
my
articles
transferred
to
a
friendly
prisoner
and
addressed
by
him
to
his
mother
in
beaver
thence
to
be
forwarded
to
new
york
at
the
same
time
the
rotunda
keeper
detains
a
valuable
piece
of
ivory
sent
to
me
by
the
girl
for
the
manufacture
of
ornamental
toothpicks
the
local
ware
made
of
kitchen
bones
bleached
in
lime
turns
yellow
in
a
short
time
my
request
for
the
ivory
is
refused
on
the
plea
of
submitting
the
matter
to
the
warden
decision
who
rules
against
me
i
direct
the
return
of
it
to
my
friend
but
am
informed
that
the
ivory
has
been
mislaid
and
can
not
be
found
exasperated
i
charge
the
guard
with
the
theft
and
serve
notice
that
i
shall
demand
the
ivory
at
the
expiration
of
my
time
the
turnkey
jeers
at
the
wild
impossibility
and
i
am
placed
for
a
week
on
pennsylvania
diet
for
insulting
an
officer
chapter
xxx
whitewashed
again
christmas
my
dear
carl
i
have
been
despairing
of
reaching
you
but
the
holidays
brought
the
usual
transfers
and
at
last
friend
schraube
is
with
me
dear
carolus
i
am
worn
out
with
the
misery
of
the
months
since
you
left
and
the
many
disappointments
your
official
letters
were
not
convincing
i
fail
to
understand
why
the
plan
is
not
practicable
of
course
you
ca
write
openly
but
you
have
means
of
giving
a
hint
as
to
the
impossibilities
you
speak
of
you
say
that
i
have
become
too
estranged
from
the
outside
and
so
forth
which
may
be
true
yet
i
think
the
matter
chiefly
concerns
the
inside
and
of
that
i
am
the
best
judge
i
do
not
see
the
force
of
your
argument
when
you
dwell
upon
the
application
at
the
next
session
of
the
pardon
board
you
mean
that
the
other
plan
would
jeopardize
the
success
of
the
legal
attempt
but
there
is
not
much
hope
of
favorable
action
by
the
board
you
have
talked
all
this
over
before
but
you
seem
to
have
a
different
view
now
why
only
in
a
very
small
measure
do
your
letters
replace
in
my
life
the
talks
we
used
to
have
here
though
they
were
only
on
paper
but
i
am
much
interested
in
your
activities
it
seems
strange
that
you
so
long
the
companion
of
my
silence
should
now
be
in
the
very
niagara
of
life
of
our
movement
it
gives
me
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
your
experience
here
has
matured
you
and
helped
to
strengthen
and
deepen
your
convictions
it
has
had
a
similar
effect
upon
me
you
know
what
a
voluminous
reader
i
am
i
have
read
in
fact
studied
every
volume
in
the
library
here
and
now
the
chaplain
supplies
me
with
books
from
his
but
whether
it
be
philosophy
travel
or
contemporary
life
that
falls
into
my
hands
it
invariably
distils
into
my
mind
the
falsity
of
dominant
ideas
and
the
beauty
the
inevitability
of
anarchism
but
i
do
not
want
to
enlarge
upon
this
subject
now
we
can
discuss
it
through
official
channels
you
know
that
tony
and
his
nephew
are
here
we
are
just
getting
acquainted
he
works
in
the
shop
but
as
he
is
also
we
have
an
opportunity
to
exchange
notes
it
is
fortunate
that
his
identity
is
not
known
otherwise
he
would
fall
under
special
surveillance
i
have
my
eyes
on
tony
he
may
prove
valuable
i
am
still
in
solitary
with
no
prospect
of
relief
you
know
the
policy
of
the
warden
to
use
me
as
a
scapegoat
for
everything
that
happens
here
it
has
become
a
mania
with
him
think
of
it
he
blames
me
for
johnny
davis
cutting
dutch
he
laid
everything
at
my
door
when
the
legislative
investigation
took
place
it
was
a
worse
sham
than
the
previous
whitewash
several
members
called
to
see
me
at
the
cell
unofficially
they
said
they
got
a
hint
of
the
evidence
i
was
prepared
to
give
and
one
of
them
suggested
to
me
that
it
is
not
advisable
for
one
in
my
position
to
antagonize
the
warden
i
replied
that
i
was
no
toady
he
hinted
that
the
authorities
of
the
prison
might
help
me
to
procure
freedom
if
i
would
act
discreetly
i
insisted
that
i
wanted
to
be
heard
by
the
committee
they
departed
promising
to
call
me
as
a
witness
one
senator
remarked
as
he
left
you
are
too
intelligent
a
man
to
be
at
large
when
the
hearing
opened
several
officers
were
the
first
to
take
the
stand
the
testimony
was
not
entirely
favorable
to
the
warden
then
sawhill
was
called
you
know
him
he
is
an
independent
sort
of
man
with
an
eye
upon
the
wardenship
his
evidence
came
like
a
bomb
he
charged
the
management
with
corruption
and
fraud
and
so
forth
the
investigators
took
fright
they
closed
the
sessions
and
departed
for
harrisburg
announcing
through
the
press
that
they
would
visit
moyamensing
and
then
return
to
riverside
but
they
did
not
return
the
report
they
submitted
to
the
governor
exonerated
the
warden
the
men
were
gloomy
over
the
state
of
affairs
a
hundred
prisoners
were
prepared
to
testify
and
much
was
expected
from
the
committee
i
had
all
my
facts
on
hand
bob
had
fished
out
for
me
the
bundle
of
material
from
its
hiding
place
it
was
in
good
condition
in
spite
of
the
long
soaking
i
am
enclosing
some
new
data
in
this
letter
for
use
in
our
book
now
that
he
is
cleared
the
warden
has
grown
even
more
arrogant
and
despotic
yet
good
the
agitation
in
the
press
has
accomplished
clubbings
are
less
frequent
and
the
bull
ring
is
temporarily
abolished
but
his
hatred
of
me
has
grown
venomous
he
holds
us
responsible
together
with
dempsey
and
beatty
for
organizing
the
opposition
to
convict
labor
which
has
culminated
in
the
muehlbronner
law
it
is
to
take
effect
on
the
first
of
the
year
the
prison
administration
is
very
bitter
because
the
statute
which
permits
only
per
cent
of
the
inmates
to
be
employed
in
productive
labor
will
considerably
minimize
opportunities
for
graft
but
the
men
are
rejoicing
the
terrible
slavery
in
the
shops
has
driven
many
to
insanity
and
death
the
law
is
one
of
the
rare
instances
of
rational
legislation
its
benefit
to
labor
in
general
is
nullified
however
by
limiting
convict
competition
only
within
the
state
the
inspectors
are
already
seeking
a
market
for
the
prison
products
in
other
states
while
the
convict
manufactures
of
new
york
ohio
illinois
are
disposed
of
in
pennsylvania
the
irony
of
beneficent
legislation
on
the
other
hand
the
inmates
need
not
suffer
for
lack
of
employment
the
new
law
allows
the
unlimited
manufacture
within
the
prison
of
products
for
local
consumption
if
the
whine
of
the
management
regarding
the
detrimental
effect
of
idleness
on
the
convict
is
sincere
they
could
employ
five
times
the
population
of
the
prison
in
the
production
of
articles
for
our
own
needs
at
present
all
the
requirements
of
the
penitentiary
are
supplied
from
the
outside
the
purchase
of
a
farm
following
the
example
set
by
the
workhouse
would
alone
afford
work
for
a
considerable
number
of
men
i
have
suggested
in
a
letter
to
the
inspectors
various
methods
by
which
every
inmate
of
the
institution
could
be
employed
among
them
the
publication
of
a
prison
paper
of
course
they
have
ignored
me
but
what
can
you
expect
of
a
body
of
philanthropists
who
have
the
interest
of
the
convict
so
much
at
heart
that
they
delegated
the
president
of
the
board
george
kelly
to
oppose
the
parole
bill
a
measure
certainly
along
advanced
lines
of
modern
criminology
owing
to
the
influence
of
inspector
kelly
the
bill
was
shelved
at
the
last
session
of
the
legislature
though
the
prisoners
have
been
praying
for
it
for
years
it
has
robbed
the
moneyless
lifetimers
of
their
last
hope
a
clause
in
the
parole
bill
held
out
to
them
the
promise
of
release
after
years
of
good
behavior
dark
days
are
in
store
for
the
men
apparently
the
campaign
of
the
inspectors
consists
in
forcing
the
repeal
of
the
muehlbronner
law
by
raising
the
hue
and
cry
of
insanity
and
sickness
they
are
actually
causing
both
by
keeping
half
the
population
locked
up
you
know
how
quickly
the
solitary
drives
certain
classes
of
prisoners
insane
especially
the
more
ignorant
element
whose
mental
horizon
is
circumscribed
by
their
personal
troubles
and
pain
speedily
fall
victims
think
of
men
who
can
not
even
read
put
for
months
at
a
time
for
years
even
most
of
the
colored
prisoners
and
those
accustomed
to
outdoor
life
such
as
farmers
and
the
like
quickly
develop
the
germs
of
consumption
in
close
confinement
now
this
wilful
murder
for
it
is
nothing
else
is
absolutely
unnecessary
the
yard
is
big
and
well
protected
by
the
wall
with
armed
guards
patrolling
it
why
not
give
the
unemployed
men
air
and
exercise
since
the
management
is
determined
to
keep
them
idle
i
suggested
the
idea
to
the
warden
but
he
berated
me
for
my
habitual
interference
in
matters
that
do
not
concern
me
i
often
wonder
at
the
enigma
of
human
nature
there
the
captain
a
man
years
old
he
should
bethink
himself
of
death
of
meeting
his
maker
since
he
pretends
to
believe
in
religion
instead
he
is
bending
all
his
energies
to
increase
insanity
and
disease
among
the
convicts
in
order
to
force
the
repeal
of
the
law
that
has
lessened
the
flow
of
blood
money
it
is
almost
beyond
belief
but
you
have
yourself
witnessed
the
effect
of
a
brutal
atmosphere
upon
new
officers
wright
has
been
warden
for
thirty
years
he
has
come
to
regard
the
prison
as
his
undisputed
dominion
and
now
he
is
furious
at
the
legislative
curtailment
of
his
absolute
control
this
letter
will
remind
you
of
our
bulky
notes
in
the
good
old
days
when
kg
were
here
i
miss
our
correspondence
there
are
some
intelligent
men
on
the
range
but
they
are
not
interested
in
the
thoughts
that
seethe
within
me
and
call
for
expression
just
now
the
chief
topic
of
local
interest
after
of
course
the
usual
discussion
of
the
grub
women
kids
and
their
health
and
troubles
is
the
spanish
war
and
the
new
in
which
the
shop
employees
are
to
be
fed
out
of
chinaware
think
of
it
some
of
the
men
are
tremendously
patriotic
others
welcome
the
war
as
a
sinecure
affording
easy
money
and
plenty
of
excitement
you
remember
young
butch
and
his
partners
murtha
tommy
etc
they
have
recently
been
released
too
wasted
and
broken
in
health
to
be
fit
for
manual
labor
all
of
them
have
signified
their
intention
of
joining
the
insurrection
some
are
enrolling
in
the
regular
army
for
the
war
butch
is
already
in
cuba
i
had
a
letter
from
him
there
is
a
passage
in
it
that
is
tragically
characteristic
he
refers
to
a
skirmish
he
participated
in
we
shot
a
lot
of
spaniards
mostly
from
ambush
he
writes
it
was
great
sport
it
is
the
attitude
of
the
military
adventurer
to
whom
a
sacred
cause
like
the
cuban
uprising
unfortunately
affords
the
opportunity
to
satisfy
his
lust
for
blood
butch
was
a
very
gentle
boy
when
he
entered
the
prison
but
he
has
witnessed
much
heartlessness
and
cruelty
during
his
term
of
three
years
letter
growing
rather
long
good
night
a
the
eastern
penitentiary
at
philadelphia
chapter
xxxi
and
by
all
forgot
we
rot
and
rot
i
a
year
of
solitary
has
wasted
my
strength
and
left
me
feeble
and
languid
my
expectations
of
relief
from
complete
isolation
have
been
disappointed
existence
is
grim
with
despair
as
day
by
day
i
feel
my
vitality
ebbing
the
long
nights
are
tortured
with
insomnia
my
body
is
racked
with
constant
pains
all
my
heart
is
dark
a
glimmer
of
light
breaks
through
the
clouds
as
the
session
of
the
pardon
board
approaches
i
clutch
desperately
at
the
faint
hope
of
a
favorable
decision
with
feverish
excitement
i
pore
over
the
letters
of
the
girl
breathing
cheer
and
encouraging
news
my
application
is
supported
by
numerous
labor
bodies
she
writes
comrade
harry
kelly
has
been
tireless
in
my
behalf
the
success
of
his
efforts
to
arouse
public
sympathy
augurs
well
for
the
application
the
united
labor
league
of
pennsylvania
representing
over
a
hundred
thousand
toilers
has
passed
a
resolution
favoring
my
release
together
with
other
similar
expressions
individual
and
collective
it
will
be
laid
before
the
pardon
board
and
it
is
confidently
expected
that
the
authorities
will
not
ignore
the
voice
of
organized
labor
in
a
ferment
of
anxiety
and
hope
i
count
the
days
and
hours
irritable
with
impatience
and
apprehension
as
i
near
the
fateful
moment
visions
of
liberty
flutter
before
me
glorified
by
the
meeting
with
the
girl
and
my
former
companions
and
i
thrill
with
the
return
to
the
world
as
i
restlessly
pace
the
cell
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
thought
of
my
prison
friends
obtrudes
upon
my
visions
with
the
tenderness
born
of
common
misery
i
think
of
their
fate
resolving
to
brighten
their
lives
with
little
comforts
and
letters
that
mean
so
much
to
every
prisoner
my
first
act
in
liberty
shall
be
in
memory
of
the
men
grown
close
to
me
with
the
kinship
of
suffering
the
unfortunates
endeared
by
awakened
sympathy
and
understanding
for
so
many
years
i
have
shared
with
them
the
sorrows
and
the
few
joys
of
penitentiary
life
i
feel
almost
guilty
to
leave
them
but
henceforth
their
cause
shall
be
mine
a
vital
part
of
the
larger
social
cause
it
will
be
my
constant
endeavor
to
ameliorate
their
condition
and
i
shall
strain
every
effort
for
my
little
friend
felipe
i
must
secure
his
release
how
happy
the
boy
will
be
to
join
me
in
liberty
the
flash
of
the
dark
lantern
dispels
my
fantasies
and
again
i
walk
the
cell
in
vehement
misgiving
and
fervent
hope
of
verdict
at
noon
i
am
called
to
the
warden
he
must
have
received
word
from
the
board
i
reflect
on
the
way
the
captain
lounges
in
the
armchair
his
eyes
glistening
his
seamed
face
yellow
and
worried
with
an
effort
i
control
my
impatience
as
he
offers
me
a
seat
he
bids
the
guard
depart
and
a
wild
hope
trembles
in
me
he
is
not
afraid
perhaps
good
news
sit
down
berkman
he
speaks
with
unwonted
affability
i
have
just
received
a
message
from
harrisburg
your
attorney
requests
me
to
inform
you
that
the
pardon
board
has
now
reached
your
case
it
is
probably
under
consideration
at
this
moment
i
remain
silent
the
warden
scans
me
closely
you
would
return
to
new
york
if
released
he
inquires
yes
what
are
your
plans
well
i
have
not
formed
any
yet
you
would
go
back
to
your
anarchist
friends
certainly
you
have
not
changed
your
views
by
no
means
a
turnkey
enters
captain
on
official
business
he
reports
wait
here
a
moment
berkman
the
warden
remarks
withdrawing
the
officer
remains
in
a
few
minutes
the
warden
returns
motioning
to
the
guard
to
leave
i
have
just
been
informed
that
the
board
has
refused
you
a
hearing
i
feel
the
cold
perspiration
running
down
my
back
the
prison
rumors
of
the
warden
interference
flash
through
my
mind
the
board
promised
a
rehearing
at
the
previous
application
why
this
refusal
warden
i
exclaim
you
objected
to
my
pardon
such
action
lies
with
the
inspectors
he
replies
evasively
the
peculiar
intonation
strengthens
my
suspicions
a
feeling
of
hopelessness
possesses
me
i
sense
the
warden
gaze
fastened
on
me
and
i
strive
to
control
my
emotion
how
much
time
have
you
yet
he
asks
over
eleven
years
how
long
have
you
been
locked
up
this
time
sixteen
months
there
is
a
vacancy
on
your
range
the
assistant
hallman
is
going
home
you
would
like
the
position
he
eyes
me
curiously
yes
i
consider
it
i
rise
weakly
but
he
detains
me
by
the
way
berkman
look
at
this
he
holds
up
a
small
wooden
box
disclosing
several
casts
of
plaster
of
paris
i
wonder
at
the
strange
proceeding
you
know
what
they
are
he
inquires
plaster
casts
i
think
of
what
for
what
purpose
look
at
them
well
now
i
glance
indifferently
at
the
molds
bearing
the
clear
impression
of
an
eagle
it
the
cast
of
a
silver
dollar
i
believe
i
am
glad
you
speak
truthfully
i
had
no
doubt
you
would
know
i
examined
your
library
record
and
found
that
you
have
drawn
books
on
metallurgy
oh
you
suspect
me
of
this
i
flare
up
no
not
this
time
he
smiles
in
a
suggestive
manner
you
have
drawn
practically
every
book
from
the
library
i
had
a
talk
with
the
chaplain
and
he
is
positive
that
you
would
not
be
guilty
of
counterfeiting
because
it
would
be
robbing
poor
people
the
reading
of
my
letters
must
have
familiarized
the
chaplain
with
anarchist
ideas
yes
milligan
thinks
highly
of
you
you
might
antagonize
the
management
but
he
assures
me
you
would
not
abet
such
a
crime
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
you
would
protect
the
federal
government
then
i
do
understand
you
you
would
protect
the
people
from
being
cheated
by
counterfeit
money
the
government
and
the
people
are
not
synonymous
flushing
slightly
and
frowning
he
asks
but
you
would
protect
the
poor
yes
certainly
his
face
brightens
oh
quite
so
quite
so
he
smiles
reassuringly
these
molds
were
found
hidden
in
the
north
block
no
not
in
a
cell
but
in
the
hall
we
suspect
a
certain
man
it
ed
sloane
he
is
located
two
tiers
above
you
now
berkman
the
management
is
very
anxious
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
matter
it
a
crime
against
the
people
you
may
have
heard
sloane
speaking
to
his
neighbors
about
this
no
i
am
sure
you
suspect
an
innocent
person
how
so
sloane
is
a
very
sick
man
it
the
last
thing
he
think
of
well
we
have
certain
reasons
for
suspecting
him
if
you
should
happen
to
hear
anything
just
rap
on
the
door
and
inform
the
officers
you
are
ill
they
will
be
instructed
to
send
for
me
at
once
i
ca
do
it
warden
why
not
he
demands
i
am
not
a
spy
why
certainly
not
berkman
i
should
not
ask
you
to
be
but
you
have
friends
on
the
range
you
may
learn
something
well
think
the
matter
over
he
adds
dismissing
me
bitter
disappointment
at
the
action
of
the
board
indignation
at
the
warden
suggestion
struggle
within
me
as
i
reach
my
cell
the
guard
is
about
to
lock
me
in
when
the
deputy
warden
struts
into
the
block
officer
unlock
him
he
commands
berkman
the
captain
says
you
are
to
be
assistant
rangeman
report
to
mcilvaine
for
a
broom
ii
the
unexpected
relief
strengthens
the
hope
of
liberty
local
methods
are
of
no
avail
but
now
my
opportunities
for
escape
are
more
favorable
considerable
changes
have
taken
place
during
my
solitary
and
the
first
necessity
is
to
orient
myself
some
of
my
confidants
have
been
released
others
were
transferred
during
the
investigation
period
to
the
south
wing
to
disrupt
my
connections
new
men
are
about
the
and
i
miss
many
of
my
chums
the
lower
half
of
the
bottom
ranges
a
and
k
is
now
exclusively
occupied
by
the
insane
their
numbers
greatly
augmented
poor
wingie
has
disappeared
grown
violently
insane
he
was
repeatedly
lodged
in
the
dungeon
and
finally
sent
to
an
asylum
there
my
unfortunate
friend
had
died
after
two
months
his
cell
is
now
occupied
by
irish
mike
a
boy
turned
imbecile
by
solitary
he
hops
about
on
all
fours
bleating
baah
baah
see
the
goat
i
the
goat
baah
baah
i
shudder
at
the
fate
i
have
escaped
as
i
look
at
the
familiar
faces
that
were
so
bright
with
intelligence
and
youth
now
staring
at
me
from
the
crank
row
and
their
minds
shattered
their
bodies
wasted
to
a
shadow
my
heart
bleeds
as
i
realize
that
sid
and
nick
fail
to
recognize
me
their
memory
a
total
blank
and
patsy
the
pittsburgh
bootblack
stands
at
the
door
motionless
his
eyes
glassy
lips
frozen
in
an
inane
smile
from
cell
to
cell
i
pass
the
graveyard
of
the
living
dead
the
silence
broken
only
by
intermittent
savage
yells
and
the
piteous
bleating
of
mike
the
whole
day
these
men
are
locked
in
deprived
of
exercise
and
recreation
their
rations
reduced
because
of
delinquency
new
bughouse
cases
are
continually
added
from
the
ranks
of
the
prisoners
forced
to
remain
idle
and
kept
in
solitary
the
sight
of
the
terrible
misery
almost
gives
a
touch
of
consolation
to
my
grief
over
johnny
davis
my
young
friend
had
grown
ill
in
the
foul
basket
he
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital
but
his
condition
did
not
warrant
it
the
physician
said
moreover
he
was
in
punishment
poor
boy
how
he
must
have
suffered
they
found
him
dead
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
my
body
renews
its
strength
with
the
exercise
and
greater
liberty
of
the
range
the
subtle
hope
of
the
warden
to
corrupt
me
has
turned
to
my
advantage
i
smile
with
scorn
at
his
miserable
estimate
of
human
nature
determined
by
a
lifetime
of
corruption
and
hypocrisy
how
saddening
is
the
shallowness
of
popular
opinion
warden
wright
is
hailed
as
a
progressive
man
a
deep
student
of
criminology
who
has
introduced
modern
methods
in
the
treatment
of
prisoners
as
an
expression
of
respect
and
appreciation
the
national
prison
association
has
selected
captain
wright
as
its
delegate
to
the
international
congress
at
brussels
which
is
to
take
place
in
and
all
the
time
the
warden
is
designing
new
forms
of
torture
denying
the
pleadings
of
the
idle
men
for
exercise
and
exerting
his
utmost
efforts
to
increase
sickness
and
insanity
in
the
attempt
to
force
the
repeal
of
the
convict
labor
law
the
puerility
of
his
judgment
fills
me
with
contempt
public
sentiment
in
regard
to
convict
competition
with
outside
labor
has
swept
the
state
the
efforts
of
the
warden
disastrous
though
they
be
to
the
inmates
are
doomed
to
failure
no
less
fatuous
is
the
conceit
of
his
boasted
experience
of
thirty
years
the
so
confidently
uttered
suspicion
of
ed
sloane
in
regard
to
the
counterfeiting
charge
has
proved
mere
the
real
culprit
is
bob
runyon
the
trusty
basking
in
the
warden
special
graces
his
intimate
friend
john
smith
the
witness
and
protégé
of
torrane
has
confided
to
me
the
whole
story
in
a
final
effort
to
set
himself
straight
he
even
exhibited
to
me
the
coins
made
by
runyon
together
with
the
original
molds
cast
in
the
trusty
cell
and
poor
sloane
still
under
surveillance
is
slowly
dying
of
neglect
the
doctor
charging
him
with
eating
soap
to
produce
symptoms
of
illness
iii
the
year
passes
in
a
variety
of
interests
the
girl
and
several
correspondents
hold
the
thread
of
outside
life
the
twin
has
gradually
withdrawn
from
our
new
york
circles
and
is
now
entirely
obscured
on
my
horizon
but
the
girl
is
staunch
and
devoted
and
i
keenly
anticipate
her
regular
mail
she
keeps
me
informed
of
events
in
the
international
labor
movement
news
of
which
is
almost
entirely
lacking
in
the
daily
press
we
discuss
the
revolutionary
expressions
of
the
times
and
i
learn
more
about
pallas
and
luccheni
whose
acts
of
the
previous
winter
had
thrown
europe
into
a
ferment
of
agitation
i
hunger
for
news
of
the
agitation
against
the
tortures
in
montjuich
the
revival
of
the
inquisition
rousing
in
me
the
spirit
of
retribution
and
deep
compassion
for
my
persecuted
comrades
in
the
spanish
bastille
beneath
the
suppressed
tone
of
her
letters
i
read
the
girl
suffering
and
pain
and
feel
the
heart
pangs
of
her
unuttered
personal
sorrows
presently
i
am
apprised
that
some
prominent
persons
interested
in
my
case
are
endeavoring
to
secure
carnegie
signature
for
a
renewed
application
to
the
board
of
pardons
the
girl
conveys
the
information
guardedly
the
absence
of
comment
discovers
to
me
the
anguish
of
soul
the
step
has
caused
her
what
terrible
despair
had
given
birth
to
the
suggestion
i
wonder
if
the
project
of
the
underground
escape
had
been
put
in
operation
we
should
not
have
had
to
suffer
such
humiliation
why
have
my
friends
ignored
the
detailed
plan
i
had
submitted
to
them
through
carl
i
am
confident
of
its
feasibility
and
success
if
we
can
muster
the
necessary
skill
and
outlay
the
animosity
of
the
prison
authorities
precludes
the
thought
of
legal
release
the
underground
route
very
difficult
and
expensive
though
it
be
is
the
sole
hope
it
must
be
realized
my
communications
suspended
during
the
temporary
absence
of
schraube
i
hint
these
thoughts
in
official
mail
to
the
girl
but
refrain
from
objecting
to
the
carnegie
idea
other
matters
of
interest
i
learn
from
correspondence
with
friends
in
philadelphia
and
pittsburgh
the
frequent
letters
of
carl
still
reminiscent
of
his
sojourn
at
riverside
thrill
with
the
joy
of
active
propaganda
and
of
his
success
as
public
speaker
voltairine
de
cleyre
and
sarah
patton
lend
color
to
my
existence
by
discursive
epistles
of
great
charm
and
rebellious
thought
often
i
pause
to
wonder
at
the
miracle
of
my
mail
passing
the
censorial
eyes
but
the
chaplain
is
a
busy
man
careful
perusal
of
every
letter
would
involve
too
great
a
demand
upon
his
time
the
correspondence
with
mattie
i
turn
over
to
my
neighbor
pasquale
a
young
italian
serving
sixteen
years
who
has
developed
a
violent
passion
for
the
pretty
face
on
the
photograph
the
roguish
eyes
and
sweet
lips
exert
but
a
passing
impression
upon
me
my
thoughts
turn
to
johnny
my
young
friend
in
the
convict
grave
deep
snow
is
on
the
ground
it
must
be
cold
beneath
the
sod
the
white
shroud
is
pressing
pressing
heavily
upon
the
lone
boy
like
the
suffocating
night
of
the
basket
cell
but
in
the
spring
little
blades
of
green
will
sprout
and
perhaps
a
rosebud
will
timidly
burst
and
flower
all
white
and
perfume
the
air
and
shed
its
autumn
tears
upon
the
convict
grave
of
johnny

february
dear
carolus
the
greeks
thought
the
gods
spiteful
creatures
when
things
begin
to
look
brighter
for
man
they
grow
envious
you
be
surprised
schraube
has
turned
into
an
enemy
mostly
my
own
fault
that
the
sting
of
it
it
will
explain
to
you
the
failure
of
the
former
route
the
present
one
is
safe
but
very
temporary
it
happened
last
fall
from
assistant
i
was
advanced
to
hallman
having
charge
of
the
crank
row
on
range
a
a
new
order
curtailed
the
rations
of
the
insane
no
cornbread
cheese
or
hash
only
bread
and
coffee
as
rangeman
i
help
to
feed
and
generally
have
extras
left
on
the
wagon
some
one
sick
or
refusing
food
etc
i
used
to
distribute
the
extras
on
the
among
the
men
deprived
of
them
one
day
just
before
christmas
an
officer
happened
to
notice
patsy
chewing
a
piece
of
cheese
the
poor
fellow
is
quite
an
imbecile
he
did
not
know
enough
to
hide
what
i
gave
him
well
you
are
aware
that
cornbread
tom
does
not
love
me
he
reported
me
i
admitted
the
charge
to
the
warden
and
tried
to
tell
him
how
hungry
the
men
were
he
would
hear
of
it
saying
that
the
insane
should
not
overload
their
stomachs
i
was
ordered
locked
up
within
a
month
i
was
out
again
but
imagine
my
surprise
when
schraube
refused
even
to
talk
to
me
at
first
i
could
not
fathom
the
mystery
later
i
learned
that
he
was
reprimanded
losing
ten
days
pay
for
allowing
me
to
feed
the
demented
he
knew
nothing
about
it
of
course
but
he
was
at
the
time
in
special
charge
of
crank
row
the
schraube
has
been
telling
my
friends
that
i
got
him
in
trouble
wilfully
he
seems
to
nurse
his
grievance
with
much
bitterness
he
apparently
hates
me
now
with
the
hatred
we
often
feel
toward
those
who
know
our
secrets
but
he
realizes
he
has
nothing
to
fear
from
me
many
changes
have
taken
place
since
you
left
you
would
hardly
recognize
the
block
if
you
returned
better
stay
out
though
no
more
talking
through
the
waste
pipes
the
new
privies
have
standing
water
electricity
is
gradually
taking
the
place
of
candles
the
garish
light
is
almost
driving
me
blind
and
the
innovation
has
created
a
new
problem
how
to
light
our
pipes
we
are
given
the
same
monthly
allowance
of
matches
each
package
supposed
to
contain
but
usually
have
and
last
month
i
received
only
i
made
a
kick
but
it
was
in
vain
the
worst
of
it
is
fully
a
third
of
the
matches
are
damp
and
do
light
while
we
used
candles
we
managed
somehow
borrowing
a
few
matches
occasionally
from
but
now
that
candles
are
abolished
the
difficulty
is
very
serious
i
split
each
match
into
four
sometimes
i
succeed
in
making
six
there
is
a
man
on
the
range
who
is
an
artist
at
it
he
can
make
eight
cuts
out
of
a
match
all
serviceable
too
even
at
that
there
is
a
famine
and
i
have
been
forced
to
return
to
the
stone
age
with
flint
and
tinder
i
draw
the
fire
of
prometheus
the
is
in
full
blast
the
sight
of
a
thousand
men
bent
over
their
food
in
complete
silence
officers
flanking
each
table
is
by
no
means
appetizing
but
during
the
spanish
war
the
place
resembled
the
on
new
year
eve
the
patriotic
warden
daily
read
to
the
diners
the
latest
news
and
such
cheering
and
wild
yelling
you
have
never
heard
especially
did
the
hobson
exploit
fire
the
spirit
of
jingoism
but
the
enthusiasm
suddenly
cooled
when
the
men
realized
that
they
were
wasting
precious
minutes
hurrahing
and
then
leaving
the
table
hungry
when
the
bell
terminated
the
meal
some
tried
to
pocket
the
uneaten
beans
and
rice
but
the
guards
detected
them
and
after
that
the
warden
war
reports
were
accompanied
only
with
loud
munching
and
champing
another
innovation
is
exercise
your
interviews
with
the
reporters
and
those
of
other
released
prisoners
have
at
last
forced
the
warden
to
allow
the
idle
men
an
hour
recreation
in
inclement
weather
they
walk
in
the
on
fine
days
in
the
yard
the
reform
was
instituted
last
autumn
and
the
improvement
in
health
is
remarkable
the
doctor
is
enthusiastically
in
favor
of
the
privilege
the
has
been
so
considerably
reduced
that
he
estimates
his
at
two
hours
daily
some
of
the
boys
tell
me
they
have
almost
entirely
ceased
masturbating
the
shop
employees
envy
the
idlers
now
many
have
purposely
precipitated
trouble
in
order
to
be
put
in
solitary
and
thus
enjoy
an
hour
in
the
open
but
sandy
got
next
and
now
those
locked
up
for
cause
are
excluded
from
exercise
here
are
some
data
for
our
book
the
population
at
the
end
of
last
year
was
the
lowest
point
in
over
a
decade
the
warden
admits
that
the
war
has
decreased
crime
the
inspectors
report
refers
to
the
improved
economic
conditions
as
compared
with
the
panicky
times
of
the
opening
years
in
the
but
the
authorities
do
not
appear
very
happy
over
the
reduction
in
the
riverside
population
you
understand
the
reason
the
smaller
the
total
the
less
men
may
be
exploited
in
the
industries
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
whether
there
is
collusion
between
the
judges
and
the
administration
of
the
prison
but
it
is
very
significant
that
the
class
of
offenders
formerly
sent
to
the
workhouse
are
being
increasingly
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
and
an
unusual
number
are
transferred
here
from
the
reformatory
at
huntington
and
the
reform
school
of
morganza
the
joke
about
the
warden
telephoning
to
the
criminal
court
to
notify
the
judges
how
many
men
are
wanted
for
the
stocking
shop
the
unions
might
be
interested
in
the
methods
of
nullifying
the
convict
labor
law
in
every
shop
twice
as
many
are
employed
as
the
statute
allows
the
illegal
are
carried
on
the
books
as
men
working
on
state
account
that
is
as
cleaners
and
clerks
not
as
producers
thus
it
happens
that
in
the
mat
shop
for
instance
more
men
are
booked
as
clerks
and
sweepers
than
are
employed
on
the
looms
in
the
broom
shop
there
are
supposed
clerks
and
cleaners
to
a
total
of
producers
legally
permitted
this
is
the
way
the
legislation
works
on
which
the
labor
bodies
have
expended
such
tremendous
efforts
the
broom
shop
is
still
contracted
to
lang
with
their
own
foreman
in
charge
and
his
son
a
guard
in
the
prison
enough
for
when
i
hear
of
the
safe
arrival
of
this
letter
i
may
have
more
intimate
things
to
discuss
a
chapter
xxxiii
the
tunnel
i
the
adverse
decision
of
the
board
of
pardons
terminates
all
hope
of
release
by
legal
means
had
the
board
refused
to
commute
my
sentence
after
hearing
the
argument
another
attempt
could
be
made
later
on
but
the
refusal
to
grant
a
rehearing
the
crafty
stratagem
to
circumvent
even
the
presentation
of
my
case
reveals
the
duplicity
of
the
previous
promise
and
the
guilty
consciousness
of
the
illegality
of
my
multiplied
sentences
the
authorities
are
determined
that
i
should
remain
in
the
prison
confident
that
it
will
prove
my
tomb
realizing
this
fires
my
defiance
and
all
the
stubborn
resistance
of
my
being
there
is
no
hope
of
surviving
my
term
at
best
even
with
the
full
benefit
of
the
commutation
time
which
will
hardly
be
granted
me
in
view
of
the
attitude
of
the
prison
management
i
still
have
over
nine
years
to
serve
but
existence
is
becoming
increasingly
more
unbearable
long
confinement
and
the
solitary
have
drained
my
vitality
to
endure
the
nine
years
is
almost
a
physical
impossibility
i
must
therefore
concentrate
all
my
energy
and
efforts
upon
escape
my
position
as
rangeman
is
of
utmost
advantage
i
have
access
to
every
part
of
the
excepting
the
crank
row
the
incident
of
feeding
the
insane
has
put
an
embargo
upon
my
communication
with
them
a
special
hallboy
having
been
assigned
to
care
for
the
deranged
but
within
my
area
on
the
range
are
the
recent
arrivals
and
the
sane
solitaries
the
division
of
my
duties
with
the
new
man
merely
facilitates
my
task
and
affords
me
more
leisure
the
longing
for
liberty
constantly
besets
my
mind
suggesting
various
projects
the
idea
of
escape
daily
strengthens
into
the
determination
born
of
despair
it
possesses
me
with
an
exclusive
passion
shaping
every
thought
molding
every
action
by
degrees
i
curtail
correspondence
with
my
prison
chums
that
i
may
devote
the
solitude
of
the
evening
to
the
development
of
my
plans
the
underground
tunnel
masters
my
mind
with
the
boldness
of
its
conception
its
tremendous
possibilities
but
the
execution
why
do
my
friends
regard
the
matter
so
indifferently
their
tepidity
irritates
me
often
i
lash
myself
into
wild
anger
with
carl
for
having
failed
to
impress
my
comrades
with
the
feasibility
of
the
plan
to
fire
them
with
the
enthusiasm
of
activity
my
route
is
sporadic
and
uncertain
repeatedly
i
have
hinted
to
my
friends
the
bitter
surprise
i
feel
at
their
provoking
indifference
but
my
reproaches
have
been
studiously
ignored
i
can
not
believe
that
conditions
in
the
movement
preclude
the
realization
of
my
suggestion
these
things
have
been
accomplished
in
russia
why
not
in
america
the
attempt
should
be
made
if
only
for
its
propagandistic
effect
true
the
project
will
require
considerable
outlay
and
the
work
of
skilled
and
trustworthy
men
have
we
no
such
in
our
ranks
in
parsons
and
lum
this
country
has
produced
her
zheliabovs
is
the
genius
of
america
not
equal
to
a
hartman
the
tacit
skepticism
of
my
correspondents
pain
me
and
rouses
my
resentment
they
evidently
lack
faith
in
the
judgment
of
one
who
has
been
so
long
separated
from
their
world
from
the
interests
and
struggles
of
the
living
the
consciousness
of
my
helplessness
without
aid
from
the
outside
gnaws
at
me
filling
my
days
with
bitterness
but
i
will
persevere
i
will
compel
their
attention
and
their
activity
aye
their
enthusiasm
hartman
engineered
the
tunnel
beneath
the
moscow
railway
undermined
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
kill
alexander
in
with
utmost
zeal
i
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
tony
the
months
of
frequent
correspondence
and
occasional
personal
meetings
have
developed
a
spirit
of
congeniality
and
good
will
i
exert
my
ingenuity
to
create
opportunities
for
stolen
interviews
and
closer
comradeship
through
the
aid
of
a
friendly
officer
i
procure
for
tony
the
privilege
of
assisting
his
rangeman
after
shop
hours
thus
enabling
him
to
communicate
with
me
to
greater
advantage
gradually
we
become
intimate
and
i
learn
the
story
of
his
life
rich
in
adventure
and
experience
an
alsatian
small
and
wiry
tony
is
a
man
of
quick
wit
with
a
considerable
dash
of
the
frenchman
about
him
he
is
intelligent
and
daring
the
very
man
to
carry
out
my
plan
for
days
i
debate
in
my
mind
the
momentous
question
shall
i
confide
the
project
to
tony
it
would
be
placing
myself
in
his
power
jeopardizing
the
sole
hope
of
my
life
yet
it
is
the
only
way
i
must
rely
on
my
intuition
of
the
man
worth
my
nights
are
sleepless
excruciating
with
the
agony
of
indecision
but
my
friend
sentence
is
nearing
completion
we
shall
need
time
for
discussion
and
preparation
for
thorough
consideration
of
every
detail
at
last
i
resolve
to
take
the
decisive
step
and
next
day
i
reveal
the
secret
to
tony
his
manner
allays
apprehension
serene
and
he
listens
gravely
to
my
plan
smiles
with
apparent
satisfaction
and
briefly
announces
that
it
shall
be
done
only
the
shining
eyes
of
my
reticent
comrade
betray
his
elation
at
the
bold
scheme
and
his
joy
in
the
adventure
he
is
confident
that
the
idea
is
feasible
suggesting
the
careful
elaboration
of
details
and
the
invention
of
a
cipher
to
insure
greater
safety
for
our
correspondence
the
precaution
is
necessary
it
will
prove
of
inestimable
value
upon
his
release
with
great
circumspection
the
cryptogram
is
prepared
based
on
a
discarded
system
of
german
shorthand
but
somewhat
altered
and
further
involved
by
the
use
of
words
of
our
own
coinage
the
cipher
thus
perfected
will
defy
the
skill
of
the
most
expert
but
developments
within
the
prison
necessitate
changes
in
the
project
the
building
operations
near
the
bathhouse
destroy
the
serviceability
of
the
latter
for
my
purpose
we
consider
several
new
routes
but
soon
realize
that
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
construction
of
the
penitentiary
gas
and
sewer
systems
may
defeat
our
success
there
are
no
means
of
procuring
the
necessary
information
tony
is
confined
to
the
shop
while
i
am
never
permitted
out
of
the
in
vain
i
strive
to
solve
the
difficulty
weeks
pass
without
bringing
light
my
providence
comes
unexpectedly
in
the
guise
of
a
fight
in
the
yard
the
combatants
are
locked
up
on
my
range
one
of
them
proves
to
be
mac
an
aged
prisoner
serving
a
third
term
during
his
previous
confinement
he
had
filled
the
position
of
fireman
one
of
his
duties
consisting
in
the
weekly
flushing
of
the
sewers
he
is
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
underground
piping
of
the
yard
but
his
reputation
among
the
inmates
is
tinged
with
the
odor
of
sycophancy
he
is
however
the
only
means
of
solving
my
difficulty
and
i
diligently
set
myself
to
gain
his
friendship
i
lighten
his
solitary
by
numerous
expressions
of
my
sympathy
often
secretly
supplying
him
with
little
extras
procured
from
my
kitchen
friends
the
loquacious
old
man
is
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
converse
and
i
devote
every
propitious
moment
to
listening
to
his
stories
of
the
great
jobs
he
had
accomplished
in
his
time
the
celebrated
guns
with
whom
he
had
associated
the
great
hauls
he
had
made
and
blowed
in
with
fellers
i
suffer
his
chatter
patiently
encouraging
the
recital
of
his
prison
experiences
and
leading
him
on
to
dwell
upon
his
last
bit
he
becomes
reminiscent
of
his
friends
in
riverside
bewails
the
early
graves
of
some
others
gone
bugs
and
rejoices
over
his
good
chum
patty
mcgraw
managing
to
escape
the
subject
gives
mac
a
new
start
and
he
waxes
enthusiastic
over
the
ingenuity
of
patty
while
i
express
surprise
that
he
himself
had
never
attempted
to
take
french
leave
what
he
bristles
up
think
i
such
a
dummy
and
with
great
detail
he
discloses
his
plan
in
th
to
swim
through
the
sewer
i
scoff
at
his
folly
you
must
have
been
a
chump
mac
to
think
it
could
be
done
i
remark
i
was
was
i
what
do
you
know
about
the
piping
eh
now
let
me
tell
you
just
wait
and
snatching
up
his
library
slate
he
draws
a
complete
diagram
of
the
prison
sewerage
in
the
extreme
southwest
corner
of
the
yard
he
indicates
a
blind
underground
alley
what
this
i
ask
in
surprise
knew
did
yer
it
a
little
connectin
cellar
with
th
females
see
not
a
dozen
men
in
th
dump
know
not
a
good
many
screws
passage
ai
been
used
fer
a
long
time
in
amazement
i
scan
the
diagram
i
had
noticed
a
little
trap
door
at
the
very
point
in
the
yard
indicated
in
the
drawing
and
i
had
often
wondered
what
purpose
it
might
serve
my
heart
dances
with
joy
at
the
happy
solution
of
my
difficulty
the
blind
alley
will
greatly
facilitate
our
work
it
is
within
fifteen
feet
or
twenty
at
most
of
the
southwestern
wall
its
situation
is
very
favorable
there
are
no
shops
in
the
vicinity
the
place
is
never
visited
by
guards
or
prisoners
the
happy
discovery
quickly
matures
the
details
of
my
plan
a
house
is
to
be
rented
opposite
the
southern
wall
on
sterling
street
preferably
it
is
to
be
situated
very
near
to
the
point
where
the
wall
adjoins
the
building
dug
in
a
direct
line
across
the
street
and
underneath
the
south
wall
the
tunnel
will
connect
with
the
blind
alley
i
shall
manage
the
rest
ii
slowly
the
autumn
wanes
the
crisp
days
of
the
indian
summer
linger
as
if
unwilling
to
depart
but
i
am
impatient
with
anxiety
and
long
for
the
winter
another
month
and
tony
will
be
free
time
lags
with
tardy
step
but
at
last
the
weeks
dwarf
into
days
and
with
joyful
heart
we
count
the
last
hours
my
friend
will
greet
the
sunshine
he
will
at
once
communicate
with
my
comrades
and
urge
the
immediate
realization
of
the
great
plan
his
and
faith
will
carry
conviction
and
stir
them
with
enthusiasm
for
the
undertaking
a
house
is
to
be
bought
or
rented
without
loss
of
time
and
the
environs
inspected
perhaps
operations
could
not
begin
till
spring
meanwhile
funds
are
to
be
collected
to
further
the
work
unfortunately
the
girl
a
splendid
organizer
is
absent
from
the
country
but
my
friends
will
carefully
follow
the
directions
i
have
entrusted
to
tony
and
through
him
i
shall
keep
in
touch
with
the
developments
i
have
little
opportunity
for
mail
by
means
of
our
cipher
however
we
can
correspond
officially
without
risk
of
the
censor
understanding
or
even
suspecting
the
flourishes
scattered
through
the
page
with
the
trusted
tony
my
thoughts
walk
beyond
the
gates
and
again
and
again
i
rehearse
every
step
in
the
project
and
study
every
detail
my
mind
dwells
in
the
outside
in
silent
preoccupation
i
perform
my
duties
on
the
range
more
rarely
i
converse
with
the
prisoners
i
must
take
care
to
comply
with
the
rules
and
to
retain
my
position
to
lose
it
would
be
disastrous
to
all
my
hopes
of
escape
as
i
pass
the
vacant
cell
in
which
i
had
spent
the
last
year
of
my
solitary
the
piteous
chirping
of
a
sparrow
breaks
in
upon
my
thoughts
the
little
visitor
almost
frozen
hops
on
the
bar
above
my
assistant
swings
the
duster
to
drive
it
away
but
the
sparrow
hovers
about
the
door
and
suddenly
flutters
to
my
shoulder
in
surprise
i
pet
the
bird
it
seems
quite
tame
why
it
dick
the
assistant
exclaims
think
of
him
coming
back
my
hands
tremble
as
i
examine
the
little
bird
with
great
joy
i
discover
the
faint
marks
of
blue
ink
i
had
smeared
under
its
wings
last
summer
when
the
warden
had
ordered
my
little
companion
thrown
out
of
the
window
how
wonderful
that
it
should
return
and
recognize
the
old
friend
and
the
cell
tenderly
i
warm
and
feed
the
bird
what
strange
sights
my
little
pet
must
have
seen
since
he
was
driven
out
into
the
world
what
struggles
and
sorrows
has
he
suffered
the
bright
eyes
look
cheerily
into
mine
speaking
mute
confidence
and
joy
while
he
pecks
from
my
hand
crumbs
of
bread
and
sugar
foolish
birdie
to
return
to
prison
for
shelter
and
food
cold
and
cruel
must
be
the
world
my
little
dick
or
is
it
friendship
that
is
stronger
than
even
love
of
liberty
so
may
it
be
almost
daily
i
see
men
pass
through
the
gates
and
soon
return
again
driven
back
by
the
world
even
like
you
little
dick
yet
others
there
are
who
would
rather
go
cold
and
hungry
in
freedom
than
be
warm
and
fed
in
prison
even
like
me
little
dick
and
still
others
there
be
who
would
risk
life
and
liberty
for
the
sake
of
their
friendship
even
like
you
and
i
hope
tony

dick
chapter

the
death
of
dick
tony
i
write
in
an
agony
of
despair
i
am
locked
up
again
it
was
all
on
account
of
my
bird
you
remember
my
feathered
pet
dick
last
summer
the
warden
ordered
him
put
out
but
when
cold
weather
set
in
dick
returned
would
you
believe
it
he
came
back
to
my
old
cell
and
recognized
me
when
i
passed
by
i
kept
him
and
he
grew
as
tame
as
before
he
had
become
a
bit
wild
in
the
life
outside
on
christmas
day
as
dick
was
playing
near
my
cell
bob
runyon
the
stool
you
know
came
by
and
deliberately
kicked
the
bird
when
i
saw
dick
turn
over
on
his
side
his
little
eyes
rolling
in
the
throes
of
death
i
rushed
at
runyon
and
knocked
him
down
he
was
not
hurt
much
and
everything
could
have
passed
off
quietly
as
no
screw
was
about
but
the
stool
reported
me
to
the
deputy
and
i
was
locked
up
mitchell
has
just
been
talking
to
me
the
good
old
fellow
was
fond
of
dick
and
he
promises
to
get
me
back
on
the
range
he
is
keeping
the
position
vacant
for
me
he
says
he
put
a
man
in
my
place
who
has
only
a
few
more
weeks
to
serve
then
i
to
take
charge
again
i
am
not
disappointed
at
your
information
that
the
work
will
have
to
wait
till
spring
it
unavoidable
but
i
am
happy
that
preparations
have
been
started
how
about
those
revolvers
though
you
have
changed
your
mind
i
hope
in
one
of
your
letters
you
seem
to
hint
that
the
matter
has
been
attended
to
how
can
that
be
jim
the
plumber
you
know
he
can
be
trusted
has
been
on
the
lookout
for
a
week
he
assures
me
that
nothing
came
so
far
why
do
you
delay
i
hope
you
did
throw
the
package
through
the
cellar
window
when
jim
was
at
his
post
hardly
probable
but
if
you
did
what
the
devil
could
have
become
of
it
i
see
no
sign
here
of
the
things
being
discovered
there
would
surely
be
a
terrible
hubbub
look
to
it
and
write
at
once
a
chapter
xxxv
an
alliance
with
the
birds
i
the
disappearance
of
the
revolvers
is
shrouded
in
mystery
in
vain
i
rack
my
brain
to
fathom
the
precarious
situation
it
defies
comprehension
and
torments
me
with
misgivings
jim
certainty
that
the
weapons
did
not
pass
between
the
bars
of
the
cellar
momentarily
allays
my
dread
but
tony
vehement
insistence
that
he
had
delivered
the
package
throws
me
into
a
panic
of
fear
my
firm
faith
in
the
two
confidants
distracts
me
with
uncertainty
and
suspense
it
is
incredible
that
tony
should
seek
to
deceive
me
yet
jim
has
kept
constant
vigil
at
the
point
of
delivery
there
is
little
probability
of
his
having
missed
the
package
but
supposing
he
has
what
has
become
of
it
perhaps
it
fell
into
some
dark
corner
of
the
cellar
the
place
must
be
searched
at
once
desperate
with
anxiety
i
resort
to
the
most
reckless
means
to
afford
jim
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
cellar
i
ransack
the
for
old
papers
and
rags
with
miserly
hand
i
gather
all
odds
and
ends
broken
tools
pieces
of
wood
a
bucketful
of
sawdust
trembling
with
fear
of
discovery
i
empty
the
treasure
into
the
sewer
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
tightly
jam
the
elbow
of
the
waste
pipe
the
smell
of
excrement
fills
the
block
the
cell
privies
overrun
and
inundate
the
hall
the
stench
is
overpowering
steadily
the
water
rises
threatening
to
flood
the
the
place
is
in
a
turmoil
the
solitaries
shout
and
rattle
on
the
bars
the
guards
rush
about
in
confusion
the
block
captain
yells
hey
jasper
hurry
call
the
plumber
get
jim
quick
but
repeated
investigation
of
the
cellar
fails
to
disclose
the
weapons
in
constant
dread
of
dire
possibilities
i
tremble
at
every
step
fancying
lurking
suspicion
sudden
discovery
and
disaster
but
the
days
pass
the
calm
of
the
prison
routine
is
undisturbed
giving
no
indication
of
untoward
happening
or
agitation
by
degrees
my
fears
subside
the
inexplicable
disappearance
of
the
revolvers
is
fraught
with
danger
the
mystery
is
disquieting
but
it
has
fortunately
brought
no
results
and
must
apparently
remain
unsolved
unexpectedly
my
fears
are
rearoused
called
to
the
desk
by
officer
mitchell
for
the
distribution
of
the
monthly
allowance
of
matches
i
casually
glance
out
of
the
yard
door
at
the
extreme
northwestern
end
assistant
deputy
hopkins
loiters
near
the
wall
slowly
walking
on
the
grass
the
unusual
presence
of
the
overseer
at
the
abandoned
gate
wakes
my
suspicion
the
singular
idling
of
the
energetic
guard
his
furtive
eyeing
of
the
ground
strengthens
my
worst
apprehensions
something
must
have
happened
are
they
suspecting
the
tunnel
but
work
has
not
been
commenced
besides
it
is
to
terminate
at
the
very
opposite
point
of
the
yard
fully
a
thousand
feet
distant
in
perplexity
i
wonder
at
the
peculiar
actions
of
hopkins
had
the
weapons
been
found
every
inmate
would
immediately
be
subjected
to
a
search
and
shops
and
ransacked
in
anxious
speculation
i
pass
a
sleepless
night
morning
dawns
without
bringing
a
solution
but
after
breakfast
the
becomes
strangely
quiet
the
shop
employees
remain
locked
in
the
rangemen
are
ordered
to
their
cells
and
guards
from
the
yard
and
shops
march
into
the
block
and
noisily
ascend
the
galleries
the
deputy
and
hopkins
scurry
about
the
hall
the
rotunda
door
is
thrown
open
with
a
clang
and
the
sharp
command
of
the
warden
resounds
through
the
general
search
i
glance
hurriedly
over
my
table
and
shelf
surprises
of
suspected
prisoners
are
frequent
and
i
am
always
prepared
but
some
contraband
is
on
hand
quickly
i
snatch
my
writing
material
from
the
womb
of
the
bedtick
in
the
very
act
of
destroying
several
sketches
of
the
previous
year
a
bright
thought
flashes
across
my
mind
there
is
nothing
dangerous
about
them
save
the
theft
of
the
paper
prison
types
in
the
streets
of
new
york
parkhurst
and
the
prostitute
libertas
a
study
in
philology
the
slavery
of
tradition
harmless
products
of
evening
leisure
let
them
find
the
booklets
i
be
severely
reprimanded
for
appropriating
material
from
the
shops
but
my
sketches
will
serve
to
divert
suspicion
the
warden
will
secretly
rejoice
that
my
mind
is
not
busy
with
more
dangerous
activities
but
the
sudden
search
signifies
grave
developments
general
overhaulings
involving
temporary
suspension
of
the
industries
and
consequent
financial
loss
are
rare
the
search
of
the
entire
prison
is
not
due
till
spring
its
precipitancy
confirms
my
worst
fears
the
weapons
have
undoubtedly
been
found
failure
to
get
possession
of
them
assumes
a
peculiar
aspect
it
is
possible
of
course
that
some
guard
unexpectedly
passing
through
the
cellar
discovered
the
bundle
between
the
bars
and
appropriated
it
without
attracting
jim
notice
yet
the
latter
confident
assertion
of
his
presence
at
the
window
at
the
appointed
moment
indicates
another
probability
the
thought
is
painful
disquieting
but
who
knows
in
an
atmosphere
of
fear
and
distrust
and
almost
universal
espionage
the
best
friendships
are
tinged
with
suspicion
it
may
be
that
jim
afraid
of
consequences
surrendered
the
weapons
to
the
warden
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
explaining
the
discovery
without
further
betrayal
of
my
confidence
yet
jim
a
pete
man
of
international
renown
enjoys
the
reputation
of
a
thoroughly
square
man
and
loyal
friend
he
has
given
me
repeated
proof
of
his
confidence
and
i
am
disinclined
to
accuse
a
possibly
innocent
man
it
is
fortunate
however
that
his
information
is
limited
to
the
weapons
no
doubt
he
suspects
some
sort
of
escape
but
i
have
left
him
in
ignorance
of
my
real
plans
with
these
tony
alone
is
entrusted
safe
blower
the
reflection
is
reassuring
even
if
indiscretion
on
tony
part
is
responsible
for
the
accident
he
has
demonstrated
his
friendship
realizing
the
danger
of
his
mission
he
may
have
thrown
in
the
weapons
between
the
cellar
bars
ignoring
my
directions
of
previously
ascertaining
the
presence
of
jim
at
his
post
but
the
discovery
of
the
revolvers
vindicates
the
veracity
of
tony
and
strengthens
my
confidence
in
him
my
fate
rests
in
the
hands
of
a
loyal
comrade
a
friend
who
has
already
dared
great
peril
for
my
sake
the
general
search
is
over
bringing
to
light
quantities
of
various
contraband
the
counterfeit
outfit
whose
product
has
been
circulating
beyond
the
walls
of
the
prison
is
discovered
resulting
in
a
secret
investigation
by
federal
officials
in
the
general
excitement
the
sketches
among
my
effects
have
been
ignored
and
left
in
my
possession
but
no
clew
has
been
found
in
connection
with
the
weapons
the
authorities
are
still
further
mystified
by
the
discovery
that
the
lock
on
the
trapdoor
in
the
roof
of
the
building
had
been
tampered
with
with
an
effort
i
suppress
a
smile
at
the
puzzled
bewilderment
of
the
kindly
old
mitchell
as
with
much
secrecy
he
confides
to
me
the
information
i
marvel
at
the
official
stupidity
that
failed
to
make
the
discovery
the
previous
year
when
by
the
aid
of
jim
and
my
young
friend
russell
i
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
while
the
inmates
were
at
church
and
wrenched
off
the
lock
of
the
trapdoor
leaving
in
its
place
an
apparent
counterpart
provided
by
jim
with
the
key
in
our
possession
we
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
reach
the
outside
roof
when
certain
changes
in
the
block
created
insurmountable
obstacles
forcing
the
abandonment
of
the
project
russell
was
unhappy
over
the
discovery
the
impulsive
young
prisoner
steadfastly
refusing
to
be
reconciled
to
the
failure
his
time
however
being
short
i
have
been
urging
him
to
accept
the
inevitable
the
constant
dwelling
upon
escape
makes
imprisonment
more
unbearable
the
passing
of
his
remaining
two
years
would
be
hastened
by
the
determination
to
serve
out
his
sentence
the
boy
listens
quietly
to
my
advice
his
blue
eyes
dancing
with
merriment
a
sly
smile
on
the
delicate
lips
you
are
right
aleck
he
replies
gravely
but
say
last
night
i
thought
out
a
scheme
great
and
we
sure
to
make
our
with
minute
detail
he
pictures
the
impossible
plan
of
sawing
through
the
bars
of
the
cell
at
night
holding
up
the
guards
binding
and
gagging
them
and
then
the
road
would
be
clear
the
innocent
boy
for
all
his
reputation
of
bad
man
is
not
aware
that
then
is
the
very
threshold
of
difficulties
i
seek
to
explain
to
him
that
the
guards
being
disposed
of
we
should
find
ourselves
trapped
in
the
the
solid
steel
double
doors
leading
to
the
yard
are
securely
locked
the
key
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
captain
of
the
night
watch
who
can
not
be
reached
except
through
the
rotunda
but
the
boy
is
not
to
be
daunted
we
have
to
storm
the
rotunda
then
he
remarks
calmly
and
at
once
proceeds
to
map
out
a
plan
of
campaign
he
smiles
incredulously
at
my
refusal
to
participate
in
the
wild
scheme
oh
yes
you
will
aleck
i
do
believe
a
word
you
say
i
know
you
keen
to
make
a
his
confidence
somewhat
shaken
by
my
resolution
he
announces
that
he
will
go
it
alone
the
declaration
fills
me
with
trepidation
the
reckless
youth
will
throw
away
his
life
his
attempt
may
frustrate
my
own
success
but
it
is
in
vain
to
dissuade
him
by
direct
means
i
know
the
determination
of
the
boy
the
smiling
face
veils
the
boundless
of
exuberant
youth
combined
with
indomitable
courage
the
redundance
of
animal
vitality
and
the
rebellious
spirit
have
violently
disturbed
the
inertia
of
his
rural
home
aggravating
its
staid
descendants
of
dutch
forbears
the
taunt
of
has
dripped
bitter
poison
into
the
innocent
pranks
of
russell
stamping
the
brand
of
desperado
upon
the
boy
i
tax
my
ingenuity
to
delay
the
carrying
out
of
his
project
he
has
secreted
the
saws
i
had
procured
from
the
girl
for
the
attempt
of
the
previous
year
and
his
determination
is
impatient
to
make
the
dash
for
liberty
only
his
devotion
to
me
and
respect
for
my
wishes
still
hold
the
impetuous
boy
in
leash
but
each
day
his
restlessness
increases
more
insistently
he
urges
my
participation
and
a
definite
explanation
of
my
attitude
at
a
loss
to
invent
new
objections
i
almost
despair
of
dissuading
russell
from
his
desperate
purpose
from
day
to
day
i
secure
his
solemn
promise
to
await
my
final
decision
the
while
i
vaguely
hope
for
some
development
that
would
force
the
abandonment
of
his
plan
but
nothing
disturbs
the
routine
and
i
grow
nervous
with
dread
lest
the
boy
reckless
with
impatience
thwart
my
great
project
ii
the
weather
is
moderating
the
window
sashes
in
the
hall
are
being
lowered
the
signs
of
approaching
spring
multiply
i
chafe
at
the
lack
of
news
from
tony
who
had
departed
on
his
mission
to
new
york
with
greedy
eyes
i
follow
the
chaplain
on
his
rounds
of
mail
delivery
impatient
of
his
constant
pauses
on
the
galleries
i
hasten
along
the
range
to
meet
the
postman
any
letters
for
me
mr
milligan
i
ask
with
an
effort
to
steady
my
voice
no
m
boy
my
eyes
devour
the
mail
in
his
hand
none
aleck
he
adds
this
is
for
your
neighbor
pasquale
i
feel
apprehensive
at
tony
silence
another
hours
must
elapse
before
the
chaplain
returns
perhaps
there
will
be
no
mail
for
me
either
what
can
be
the
matter
with
my
friend
so
many
dangers
menace
his
every
step
he
might
be
sick
some
accident
anxious
days
pass
without
mail
russell
is
becoming
more
insistent
threatening
a
break
the
solitaries
murmur
at
my
neglect
i
am
nervous
and
irritable
for
two
weeks
i
have
not
heard
from
tony
something
terrible
must
have
happened
in
a
ferment
of
dread
i
keep
watch
on
the
upper
rotunda
the
noon
hour
is
approaching
the
chaplain
fumbles
with
his
keys
the
door
opens
and
he
trips
along
the
ranges
stealthily
i
follow
him
under
the
galleries
pretending
to
dust
the
bars
he
descends
to
the
hall
good
morning
chaplain
i
seek
to
attract
his
attention
wistfully
peering
at
the
mail
in
his
hand
good
morning
m
boy
feeling
good
thank
you
pretty
fair
my
voice
trembles
at
his
delay
but
i
fear
betraying
my
anxiety
by
renewed
questioning

passes
me
and
i
feel
sick
with
disappointment
now
he
pauses
aleck
he
calls
i
mislaid
a
letter
for
you
yesterday
here
it
is
with
shaking
hand
i
unfold
the
sheet
in
a
fever
of
hope
and
fear
i
pore
over
it
in
the
solitude
of
the
cell
my
heart
palpitates
violently
as
i
scan
each
word
and
letter
seeking
hidden
meaning
analyzing
every
flourish
and
dash
carefully
distilling
the
minute
lines
fusing
the
significant
dots
into
the
structure
of
meaning

almost
opposite

of

funds
are
on

work
is
to
begin
at
once
with
nimble
step
i
walk
the
range
the
river
wafts
sweet
fragrance
to
my
cell
the
joy
of
spring
is
in
my
heart
every
hour
brings
me
nearer
to
liberty
the
faithful
comrades
are
steadily
working
underground
perhaps
within
a
month
or
two
at
most
the
tunnel
will
be
completed
i
count
the
days
crossing
off
each
morning
the
date
on
my
calendar
the
news
from
tony
is
cheerful
encouraging
the
work
is
progressing
smoothly
the
prospects
of
success
are
splendid
i
grow
merry
at
the
efforts
of
uninitiated
friends
in
new
york
to
carry
out
the
suggestions
of
the
attorneys
to
apply
to
the
superior
court
of
the
state
for
a
writ
on
the
ground
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
my
sentence
i
consult
gravely
with
milligan
upon
the
advisability
of
the
step
the
amiable
chaplain
affording
me
the
opportunity
of
an
extra
allowance
of
letter
paper
i
thank
my
comrades
for
their
efforts
and
urge
the
necessity
of
collecting
funds
for
the
appeal
to
the
upper
court
repeatedly
i
ask
the
advice
of
the
chaplain
in
the
legal
matter
confident
that
my
apparent
enthusiasm
will
reach
the
ears
of
the
warden
the
artifice
will
mask
my
secret
project
and
lull
suspicion
my
official
letters
breathe
assurance
of
success
and
with
much
show
of
confidence
i
impress
upon
the
trusties
my
sanguine
expectation
of
release
i
discuss
the
subject
with
officers
and
stools
till
presently
the
prison
is
agog
with
the
prospective
liberation
of
its
fourth
oldest
inmate
the
solitaries
charge
me
with
messages
to
friends
and
the
deputy
warden
offers
advice
on
behavior
beyond
the
walls
the
moment
is
propitious
for
a
bold
stroke
confined
to
the
i
shall
be
unable
to
reach
the
tunnel
the
privilege
of
the
yard
is
imperative
it
is
june
unfledged
birdies
frequently
fall
from
their
nests
and
i
induce
the
kindly
runner
southside
johnny
to
procure
for
me
a
brace
of
sparlings
i
christen
the
little
orphans
dick
and
sis
and
the
memory
of
my
previous
birds
is
revived
among
inmates
and
officers
old
mitchell
is
in
ecstasy
over
the
intelligence
and
adaptability
of
my
new
feathered
friends
but
the
birds
languish
and
waste
in
the
close
air
of
the
block
they
need
sunshine
and
gravel
and
the
dusty
street
to
bathe
in
gradually
i
enlist
the
sympathies
of
the
new
doctor
by
the
curious
performances
of
my
pets
one
day
the
warden
strolls
in
and
joins
in
admiration
of
the
wonderful
birds
who
trained
them
he
inquires
this
man
the
physician
indicates
me
a
slight
frown
flits
over
the
warden
face
old
mitchell
winks
at
me
encouragingly
captain
i
approach
the
warden
the
birds
are
sickly
for
lack
of
air
will
you
permit
me
to
give
them
an
airing
in
the
yard
why
do
you
let
them
go
you
have
no
permission
to
keep
them
oh
it
would
be
a
pity
to
throw
them
out
the
doctor
intercedes
they
are
too
tame
to
take
care
of
themselves
well
then
the
warden
decides
let
jasper
take
them
out
every
day
they
will
not
go
with
any
one
except
myself
i
inform
him
they
follow
me
everywhere
the
warden
hesitates
why
not
let
berkman
go
out
with
them
for
a
few
moments
the
doctor
suggests
i
hear
you
expect
to
be
free
soon
he
remarks
to
me
casually
your
case
is
up
for
revision
yes
well
berkman
the
warden
motions
to
me
i
will
permit
you
ten
minutes
in
the
yard
after
your
sweeping
is
done
what
time
are
you
through
with
it
at
mitchell
every
morning
at
you
will
pass
berkman
through
the
doors
for
ten
minutes
on
the
watch
then
turning
to
me
he
adds
you
are
to
stay
near
the
greenhouse
there
is
plenty
of
sand
there
if
you
cross
the
dead
line
of
the
sidewalk
or
exceed
your
time
a
single
minute
you
will
be
punished

may
my
dear
tony
your
letters
intoxicate
me
with
hope
and
joy
no
sooner
have
i
sipped
the
rich
aroma
than
i
am
athirst
for
more
nectar
write
often
dear
friend
it
is
the
only
solace
of
suspense
do
not
worry
about
this
end
of
the
line
all
is
well
by
stratagem
i
have
at
last
procured
the
privilege
of
the
yard
only
for
a
few
minutes
every
morning
but
i
am
judiciously
extending
my
prescribed
time
and
area
the
prospects
are
bright
here
every
one
talks
of
my
application
to
the
superior
court
and
peace
reigns
you
understand
a
pity
i
can
not
write
directly
to
my
dear
faithful
comrades
your
coworkers
you
shall
be
the
medium
transmit
to
them
my
deepest
appreciation
tell
yankee
and
ibsen
and
our
italian
comrades
what
i
feel
i
know
i
need
not
explain
it
further
to
you
no
one
realizes
better
than
myself
the
terrible
risks
they
are
taking
the
fearful
toil
in
silence
and
darkness
almost
within
hearing
of
the
guards
the
danger
the
heroic
what
money
could
buy
such
devotion
i
grow
faint
with
the
thought
of
their
peril
i
could
almost
cry
at
the
beautiful
demonstration
of
solidarity
and
friendship
dear
comrades
i
feel
proud
of
you
and
proud
of
the
great
truth
of
anarchism
that
can
produce
such
disciples
such
spirit
i
embrace
you
my
noble
comrades
and
may
you
speed
the
day
that
will
make
me
happy
with
the
sight
of
your
faces
the
touch
of
your
hands
june
dear
tony
your
silence
was
unbearable
the
suspense
is
terrible
was
it
really
necessary
to
halt
operations
so
long
i
am
surprised
you
did
not
foresee
the
shortage
of
air
and
the
lack
of
light
you
would
have
saved
so
much
time
it
is
a
great
relief
to
know
that
the
work
is
progressing
again
and
very
fortunate
indeed
that
yankee
understands
electricity
it
must
be
hellish
work
to
pump
air
into
the
shaft
take
precautions
against
the
whir
of
the
machinery
the
piano
idea
is
great
keep
her
playing
and
singing
as
much
as
possible
and
be
sure
you
have
all
windows
open
the
beasts
on
the
wall
will
be
soothed
by
the
music
and
it
will
drown
the
noises
underground
have
an
electric
button
connected
from
the
piano
to
the
shaft
when
the
player
sees
anything
suspicious
on
the
street
or
the
guards
on
the
wall
she
can
at
once
notify
the
comrades
to
stop
work
i
am
enclosing
the
wall
and
yard
measurements
you
asked
but
why
do
you
need
them
do
bother
with
unnecessary
things
from
house
beneath
the
street
directly
toward
the
southwestern
wall
for
that
you
can
procure
measurements
outside
on
the
inside
you
require
none
go
under
wall
about
feet
till
you
strike
wall
of
blind
alley
cut
into
it
and
all
will
be
complete
write
of
progress
without
delay
greetings
to
all
june
tony
your
letters
bewilder
me
why
has
the
route
been
changed
you
were
to
go
to
southwest
yet
you
say
now
you
are
near
the
east
wall
it
simply
incredible
tony
your
explanation
is
not
convincing
if
you
found
a
gas
main
near
the
gate
you
could
have
gone
around
it
besides
the
gate
is
out
of
your
way
anyhow
why
did
you
take
that
direction
at
all
i
wish
tony
you
would
follow
my
instructions
and
the
original
plan
your
failure
to
report
the
change
immediately
may
prove
fatal
i
could
have
informed
you
once
you
were
near
the
southeastern
gate
to
go
directly
underneath
then
you
would
have
saved
digging
under
the
wall
there
is
no
stone
foundation
of
course
beneath
the
gate
now
that
you
have
turned
the
corner
you
will
have
to
come
under
the
wall
there
and
it
is
the
worst
possible
place
because
that
particular
part
used
to
be
a
swamp
and
i
have
learned
that
it
was
filled
with
extra
masonry
another
point
an
old
abandoned
well
is
somewhere
under
the
east
wall
about
feet
from
the
gate
tell
our
friends
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
fumes
it
is
a
very
dangerous
place
special
precautions
must
be
taken

my
brusqueness
dear
tony
my
nerves
are
on
edge
the
suspense
is
driving
me
mad
and
i
must
mask
my
feelings
and
smile
and
look
indifferent
but
i
have
a
moment
peace
i
imagine
the
most
terrible
things
when
you
fail
to
write
please
be
more
punctual
i
know
you
have
your
hands
full
but
i
fear
i
go
insane
before
this
thing
is
over
tell
me
especially
how
far
you
intend
going
along
the
east
wall
and
where
you
come
out
this
complicates
the
matter
you
have
already
gone
a
longer
distance
than
would
have
been
necessary
per
original
plan
it
was
a
grave
mistake
and
if
you
were
not
such
a
devoted
friend
i
feel
very
cross
with
you
write
at
once
i
am
arranging
a
new
route
they
are
building
in
the
yard
many
outside
drivers
you
understand
dear
tony
i
in
great
haste
to
send
this
you
know
the
shed
opposite
the
east
wall
it
has
only
a
wooden
floor
and
is
not
frequented
much
by
officers
a
few
cons
are
there
from
the
stone
pile
attend
to
them
make
directly
for
that
shed
it
a
short
distance
from
wall
i
enclose
measurements
tony
you
distract
me
beyond
words
what
has
become
of
your
caution
your
judgment
a
hole
in
the
grass
not
i
am
absolutely
opposed
to
it
there
are
a
score
of
men
on
the
stone
pile
and
several
screws
it
is
sure
to
be
discovered
and
even
if
you
leave
the
upper
crust
intact
for
a
foot
or
two
how
am
i
to
dive
into
the
hole
in
the
presence
of
so
many
you
do
seem
to
have
considered
that
there
is
only
way
the
one
i
explained
in
my
last
go
to
the
shed
it
only
a
little
more
work
feet
no
more
tell
the
comrades
the
grass
idea
is
impossible
a
little
more
effort
friends
and
all
will
be
well
answer
at
once
dear
tony
why
do
you
insist
on
the
hole
in
the
ground
i
tell
you
again
it
will
not
do
i
wo
consider
it
for
a
moment
i
am
on
the
inside
you
must
let
me
decide
what
can
or
can
not
be
done
here
i
am
prepared
to
risk
everything
for
liberty
would
risk
my
life
a
thousand
times
i
am
too
desperate
now
for
any
one
to
block
my
escape
i
break
through
a
wall
of
guards
if
necessary
but
i
still
have
a
little
judgment
though
i
am
almost
insane
with
the
suspense
and
anxiety
if
you
insist
on
the
hole
i
make
the
break
though
there
is
not
one
chance
in
a
hundred
for
success
i
beg
of
you
tony
the
thing
must
be
dug
to
the
shed
it
only
a
little
way
after
such
a
tremendous
effort
can
we
jeopardize
it
all
so
lightly
i
assure
you
the
success
of
the
hole
plan
is
unthinkable
they
all
see
me
go
down
into
it
i
be
followed
at
once
what
the
use
talking
besides
you
know
i
have
no
revolvers
of
course
i
have
a
weapon
but
it
will
not
help
the
escape
another
thing
your
change
of
plans
has
forced
me
to
get
an
assistant
the
man
is
reliable
and
i
have
only
confided
to
him
parts
of
the
project
i
need
him
to
investigate
around
the
shed
take
measurements
etc
i
am
not
permitted
anywhere
near
the
wall
but
you
need
not
trouble
about
this
i
be
responsible
for
my
friend
but
i
tell
you
about
it
so
that
you
prepare
two
pair
of
overalls
instead
of
one
also
leave
two
revolvers
in
the
house
money
and
cipher
directions
for
us
where
to
go
none
of
our
comrades
is
to
wait
for
us
let
them
all
leave
as
soon
as
everything
is
ready
but
be
sure
you
do
stop
at
the
hole
go
to
the
shed
absolutely
tony
the
hole
will
not
do
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
impossible
i
find
it
i
am
sending
an
urgent
call
for
money
to
the
editor
you
know
whom
i
mean
get
in
communication
with
him
at
once
use
the
money
to
continue
work
to
shed
a
direct
to
box
a
allegheny
city
june
dear
comrade
the
chaplain
was
very
kind
to
permit
me
an
extra
sheet
of
paper
on
urgent
business
i
write
to
you
in
a
very
great
extremity
you
are
aware
of
the
efforts
of
my
friends
to
appeal
my
case
read
carefully
please
i
have
lost
faith
in
their
attorneys
i
have
engaged
my
lawyers
lawyers
in
quotation
marks
a
prison
joke
you
see
i
have
utmost
confidence
in
lawyers
they
will
absolutely
procure
my
release
even
if
it
is
not
a
pardon
you
understand
i
mean
we
go
to
the
superior
court
different
from
a
pardon
board
another
prison
joke
my
friends
are
short
of
money
we
need
some
the
work
is
started
but
can
not
be
finished
for
lack
of
funds
mark
well
what
i
say
not
be
responsible
for
the
worst
may
happen
unless
money
is
procured
you
have
influence
i
rely
on
you
to
understand
and
to
act
promptly
your
comrade
alexander
berkman
my
poor
tony
i
can
see
how
this
thing
has
gone
on
your
nerves
to
think
that
you
you
the
cautious
tony
should
be
so
reckless
to
send
me
a
telegram
you
could
have
ruined
the
whole
thing
i
had
trouble
explaining
to
the
chaplain
but
it
all
right
now
of
course
if
it
must
be
the
hole
it
ca
be
helped
i
understood
the
meaning
of
your
wire
from
the
seventh
bar
on
the
east
wall
ten
feet
to
west
we
be
there
on
the
minute

suspicion
a
chapter
xxxvii
anxious
days
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
overwhelms
me
with
the
violence
of
an
avalanche
the
plan
of
continuing
the
work
the
trembling
hope
of
escape
of
liberty
life
all
is
suddenly
terminated
my
nerves
tense
with
the
months
of
suspense
and
anxiety
relax
abruptly
with
torpid
brain
i
wonder
is
it
possible
is
it
really
possible
an
air
of
uneasiness
as
of
lurking
danger
fills
the
prison
vague
rumors
are
afloat
a
wholesale
jail
delivery
had
been
planned
the
walls
were
to
be
dynamited
the
guards
killed
an
escape
has
actually
taken
place
it
is
whispered
about
the
warden
wears
a
look
of
bewilderment
and
fear
the
officers
are
alert
with
suspicion
the
inmates
manifest
disappointment
and
nervous
impatience
the
routine
is
violently
disturbed
the
shops
are
closed
the
men
locked
in
the
cells
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
mystifies
the
prison
and
the
city
authorities
some
children
at
play
on
the
street
had
accidentally
wandered
into
the
yard
of
the
deserted
house
opposite
the
prison
gates
the
piles
of
freshly
dug
soil
attracted
their
attention
a
boy
stumbling
into
the
cellar
was
frightened
by
the
sight
of
the
deep
cavern
his
mother
notified
the
agent
of
the
house
who
by
a
peculiar
coincidence
proved
to
be
an
officer
of
the
penitentiary
but
in
vain
are
the
efforts
of
the
prison
authorities
to
discover
any
sign
of
the
tunnel
within
the
walls
days
pass
in
the
fruitless
investigation
of
the
yard
the
outlet
of
the
tunnel
within
the
prison
can
not
be
found
perhaps
the
underground
passage
does
not
extend
to
the
penitentiary
the
warden
voices
his
firm
conviction
that
the
walls
have
not
been
penetrated
evidently
it
was
not
the
prison
he
argues
which
was
the
objective
point
of
the
diggers
the
authorities
of
the
city
of
allegheny
decide
to
investigate
the
passage
from
the
house
on
sterling
street
but
the
men
that
essay
to
crawl
through
the
narrow
tunnel
are
forced
to
abandon
their
mission
driven
back
by
the
fumes
of
escaping
gas
it
is
suggested
that
the
unknown
diggers
whatever
their
purpose
have
been
trapped
in
the
abandoned
gas
well
and
perished
before
the
arrival
of
aid
the
fearful
stench
no
doubt
indicates
the
decomposition
of
human
bodies
the
terrible
accident
has
forced
the
inmates
of
sterling
street
to
suspend
their
efforts
before
completing
the
work
the
condition
of
the
house
the
meal
on
the
table
the
clothing
scattered
about
the
rooms
the
general
disorder
all
seem
to
point
to
precipitate
flight
the
persistence
of
the
assertion
of
a
fatal
accident
disquiets
me
in
spite
of
my
knowledge
to
the
contrary
yet
perhaps
the
reckless
tony
in
his
endeavor
to
force
the
wire
signal
through
the
upper
crust
perished
in
the
well
the
thought
unnerves
me
with
horror
till
it
is
announced
that
a
negro
whom
the
police
had
induced
to
crawl
the
length
of
the
tunnel
brought
positive
assurance
that
no
life
was
sacrificed
in
the
underground
work
still
the
prison
authorities
are
unable
to
find
the
objective
point
and
it
is
finally
decided
to
tear
up
the
streets
beneath
which
the
tunnel
winds
its
mysterious
way
the
undermined
place
inside
the
walls
at
last
being
discovered
after
a
week
of
digging
at
various
points
in
the
yard
the
warden
reluctantly
admits
the
apparent
purpose
of
the
tunnel
at
the
same
time
informing
the
press
that
the
evident
design
was
the
liberation
of
the
anarchist
prisoner
he
corroborates
his
view
by
the
circumstance
that
i
had
been
reported
for
unpermitted
presence
at
the
east
wall
pretending
to
collect
gravel
for
my
birds
assistant
deputy
warden
hopkins
further
asserts
having
seen
and
talked
with
carl
nold
near
the
criminal
house
a
short
time
before
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
the
developments
fraught
with
danger
to
my
friends
greatly
alarm
me
fortunately
no
clew
can
be
found
in
the
house
save
a
note
in
cipher
which
apparently
defies
the
skill
of
experts
the
warden
on
his
sunday
rounds
passes
my
cell
then
turns
as
if
suddenly
recollecting
something
here
berkman
he
says
blandly
producing
a
paper
the
press
is
offering
a
considerable
reward
to
any
one
who
will
decipher
the
note
found
in
the
sterling
street
house
it
reproduced
here
see
if
you
ca
make
it
out
i
scan
the
paper
carefully
quickly
reading
tony
directions
for
my
movements
after
the
escape
then
returning
the
paper
i
remark
indifferently
i
can
read
several
languages
captain
but
this
is
beyond
me
the
police
and
detective
bureaus
of
the
twin
cities
make
the
announcement
that
a
thorough
investigation
conclusively
demonstrates
that
the
tunnel
was
intended
for
william
boyd
a
prisoner
serving
twelve
years
for
a
series
of
daring
forgeries
his
pals
had
succeeded
in
clearing
fifty
thousand
dollars
on
forged
bonds
and
it
is
they
who
did
the
wonderful
feat
underground
to
secure
the
liberty
of
the
valuable
penman
the
controversy
between
the
authorities
of
allegheny
and
the
management
of
the
prison
is
full
of
animosity
and
bitterness
wardens
of
prisons
chiefs
of
police
and
detective
departments
of
various
cities
are
consulted
upon
the
mystery
of
the
ingenious
diggers
and
the
discussion
in
the
press
waxes
warm
and
antagonistic
presently
the
chief
of
police
of
allegheny
suffers
a
change
of
heart
and
sides
with
the
warden
as
against
his
personal
enemy
the
head
of
the
pittsburgh
detective
bureau
the
confusion
of
published
views
and
my
persistent
denial
of
complicity
in
the
tunnel
cause
the
warden
to
fluctuate
a
number
of
men
are
made
the
victims
of
his
mental
uncertainty
following
my
exile
into
solitary
pat
mcgraw
is
locked
up
as
a
possible
beneficiary
of
the
planned
escape
in
he
had
slipped
through
the
roof
of
the
prison
the
warden
argues
and
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
man
is
meditating
another
delivery
jack
robinson
cronin
nan
and
a
score
of
others
are
in
turn
suspected
by
captain
wright
and
ordered
locked
up
during
the
preliminary
investigation
but
because
of
absolute
lack
of
clews
the
prisoners
are
presently
returned
to
work
and
the
number
of
suspects
is
reduced
to
myself
and
boyd
the
warden
having
discovered
that
the
latter
had
recently
made
an
attempt
to
escape
by
forcing
an
entry
into
the
cupola
of
the
shop
he
was
employed
in
only
to
find
the
place
useless
for
his
purpose
a
process
of
elimination
and
the
espionage
of
the
trusties
gradually
center
exclusive
suspicion
upon
myself
in
surprise
i
learn
that
young
russell
has
been
cited
before
the
captain
the
fear
of
indiscretion
on
the
part
of
the
boy
startles
me
from
my
torpor
i
must
employ
every
device
to
confound
the
authorities
and
save
my
friends
fortunately
none
of
the
tunnelers
have
yet
been
arrested
the
controversy
between
the
city
officials
and
the
prison
management
having
favored
inaction
my
comrades
can
not
be
jeopardized
by
russell
his
information
is
limited
to
the
mere
knowledge
of
the
specific
person
for
whom
the
tunnel
was
intended
the
names
of
my
friends
are
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
young
prisoner
as
i
reflect
that
never
once
had
he
manifested
curiosity
concerning
the
men
at
the
secret
work
desperate
with
confinement
and
passionately
yearning
for
liberty
though
he
was
he
had
yet
offered
to
sacrifice
his
longings
to
aid
my
escape
how
transported
with
joy
was
the
generous
youth
when
i
resolved
to
share
my
opportunity
with
him
he
had
given
faithful
service
in
attempting
to
locate
the
tunnel
entrance
the
poor
boy
had
been
quite
distracted
at
our
failure
to
find
the
spot
i
feel
confident
russell
will
not
betray
the
secret
in
his
keeping
yet
the
persistent
questioning
by
the
warden
and
inspectors
is
perceptibly
working
on
the
boy
mind
he
is
so
young
and
inexperienced
barely
nineteen
a
slip
of
the
tongue
an
inadvertent
remark
might
convert
suspicion
into
conviction
every
day
russell
is
called
to
the
office
causing
me
torments
of
apprehension
and
dread
till
a
glance
at
the
returning
prisoner
smiling
encouragingly
as
he
passes
my
cell
informs
me
that
the
danger
is
past
for
the
day
with
a
deep
pang
i
observe
the
increasing
pallor
of
his
face
the
growing
restlessness
in
his
eyes
the
languid
step
the
continuous
inquisition
is
breaking
him
down
with
quivering
voice
he
whispers
as
he
passes
aleck
i
afraid
of
them
the
warden
has
threatened
him
he
informs
me
if
he
persists
in
his
pretended
ignorance
of
the
tunnel
his
friendship
for
me
is
well
known
the
warden
reasons
we
have
often
been
seen
together
in
the
and
yard
i
must
surely
have
confided
to
russell
my
plans
of
escape
the
big
strapping
youth
is
dwindling
to
a
shadow
under
the
terrible
strain
dear
faithful
friend
how
guilty
i
feel
toward
you
how
torn
in
my
inmost
heart
to
have
suspected
your
devotion
even
for
that
brief
instant
when
in
a
panic
of
fear
you
had
denied
to
the
warden
all
knowledge
of
the
slip
of
paper
found
in
your
cell
it
cast
suspicion
upon
me
as
the
writer
of
the
strange
jewish
scrawl
the
warden
scorned
my
explanation
that
russell
desire
to
learn
hebrew
was
the
sole
reason
for
my
writing
the
alphabet
for
him
the
mutual
denial
seemed
to
point
to
some
secret
the
scrawl
was
similar
to
the
cipher
note
found
in
the
sterling
street
house
the
warden
insisted
how
strange
that
i
should
have
so
successfully
confounded
the
inspectors
with
the
contradictory
testimony
regarding
the
tunnel
that
they
returned
me
to
my
position
on
the
range
and
yet
the
insignificant
incident
of
russell
hieroglyphic
imitation
of
the
hebrew
alphabet
should
have
given
the
warden
a
pretext
to
order
me
into
solitary
how
distracted
and
bitter
i
must
have
felt
to
charge
the
boy
with
treachery
his
very
reticence
strengthened
my
suspicion
and
all
the
while
the
tears
welled
into
his
throat
choking
the
innocent
lad
beyond
speech
how
little
i
suspected
the
terrible
wound
my
hasty
imputation
had
caused
my
devoted
friend
in
silence
he
suffered
for
months
without
opportunity
to
explain
when
at
last
by
mere
accident
i
learned
the
fatal
mistake
in
vain
i
strive
to
direct
my
thoughts
into
different
channels
my
misunderstanding
of
russell
plagues
me
with
recurring
persistence
the
unjust
accusation
torments
my
sleepless
nights
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
joy
that
i
experienced
as
i
humbly
begged
his
pardon
when
i
met
him
in
the
captain
office
a
deep
sense
of
relief
almost
of
peace
filled
me
at
his
unhesitating
oh
never
mind
aleck
all
right
we
were
both
excited
i
was
overcome
by
thankfulness
and
admiration
of
the
noble
boy
and
the
next
instant
the
sight
of
his
wan
face
his
wasted
form
pierced
me
as
with
a
with
the
earnest
conviction
of
strong
faith
i
sought
to
explain
to
the
board
of
inspectors
the
unfortunate
error
regarding
the
jewish
writing
but
they
smiled
doubtfully
it
was
too
late
their
opinion
of
a
prearranged
agreement
with
russell
was
settled
but
the
testimony
of
assistant
deputy
hopkins
that
he
had
seen
and
conversed
with
nold
a
few
weeks
before
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
and
that
he
saw
him
enter
the
criminal
house
afforded
me
an
opportunity
to
divide
the
views
among
the
inspectors
i
experienced
little
difficulty
in
convincing
two
members
of
the
board
that
nold
could
not
possibly
have
been
connected
with
the
tunnel
because
for
almost
a
year
previously
and
since
he
had
been
in
the
employ
of
a
louis
firm
they
accepted
my
offer
to
prove
by
the
official
of
the
company
that
nold
was
in
louis
on
the
very
day
that
hopkins
claimed
to
have
spoken
with
him
the
fortunate
and
very
natural
error
of
hopkins
in
mistaking
the
similar
appearance
of
tony
for
that
of
carl
enabled
me
to
discredit
the
chief
link
connecting
my
friends
with
the
tunnel
the
diverging
views
of
the
police
officials
of
the
twin
cities
still
further
confounded
the
inspectors
and
i
was
gravely
informed
by
them
that
the
charge
of
attempted
escape
against
me
had
not
been
conclusively
substantiated
they
ordered
my
reinstatement
as
rangeman
but
the
captain
on
learning
the
verdict
at
once
charged
me
before
the
board
with
conducting
a
secret
correspondence
with
russell
on
the
pretext
of
the
alleged
hebrew
note
the
inspectors
confirmed
the
warden
judgment
and
i
was
sentenced
to
the
solitary
and
immediately
locked
up
in
the
south
wing
chapter
xxxviii
how
men
their
brothers
maim
i
the
solitary
is
stifling
with
the
august
heat
the
hall
windows
high
above
the
floor
cast
a
sickly
light
shrouding
the
bottom
range
in
darksome
gloom
at
every
point
my
gaze
meets
the
irritating
white
of
the
walls
in
spots
yellow
with
damp
the
long
days
are
oppressive
with
silence
the
stone
cage
echoes
my
languid
footsteps
mournfully
once
more
i
feel
cast
into
the
night
torn
from
the
midst
of
the
living
the
failure
of
the
tunnel
forever
excludes
the
hope
of
liberty
terrified
by
the
possibilities
of
the
planned
escape
the
determination
dooms
my
fate
i
shall
end
my
days
in
strictest
seclusion
he
has
informed
me
severe
punishment
is
visited
upon
any
one
daring
to
converse
with
me
even
officers
are
forbidden
to
pause
at
my
cell
old
evans
the
night
guard
is
afraid
even
to
answer
my
greeting
since
he
was
disciplined
with
the
loss
of
ten
days
pay
for
being
seen
at
my
door
it
was
not
his
fault
poor
old
man
the
night
was
sultry
the
sashes
of
the
hall
window
opposite
my
cell
were
tightly
closed
almost
suffocated
with
the
foul
air
i
requested
the
passing
evans
to
raise
the
window
it
had
been
ordered
shut
by
the
warden
he
informed
me
as
he
turned
to
leave
three
sharp
raps
on
the
bars
of
the
upper
rotunda
almost
rooted
him
to
the
spot
with
amazement
it
was
no
one
was
supposed
to
be
there
at
night
come
here
evans
i
recognized
the
curt
tones
of
the
warden
what
business
have
you
at
that
man
door
i
could
distinctly
hear
each
word
cutting
the
stillness
of
the
night
in
vain
the
frightened
officer
sought
to
explain
he
had
merely
answered
a
question
he
had
stopped
but
a
moment
i
been
watching
you
there
for
half
an
hour
the
irate
warden
insisted
report
to
me
in
the
morning
since
then
the
guards
on
their
rounds
merely
glance
between
the
bars
and
pass
on
in
silence
i
have
been
removed
within
closer
observation
of
the
nightly
prowling
captain
and
am
now
located
near
the
rotunda
in
the
second
cell
on
the
ground
floor
range
y
the
stringent
orders
of
exceptional
surveillance
have
so
terrorized
my
friends
that
they
do
not
venture
to
look
in
my
direction
a
special
officer
has
been
assigned
to
the
vicinity
of
my
door
his
sole
duty
to
keep
me
under
observation
i
feel
buried
alive
communication
with
my
comrades
has
been
interrupted
the
warden
detaining
my
mail
i
am
deprived
of
books
and
papers
all
my
privileges
curtailed
if
only
i
had
my
birds
the
company
of
my
little
pets
would
give
me
consolation
but
they
have
been
taken
from
me
and
i
fear
the
guards
have
killed
them
deprived
of
work
and
exercise
i
pass
the
days
in
the
solitary
monotonous
interminable
ii
by
degrees
anxiety
over
my
friends
is
allayed
the
mystery
of
the
tunnel
remains
unsolved
the
warden
reiterates
his
moral
certainty
that
the
underground
passage
was
intended
for
the
liberation
of
the
anarchist
prisoner
the
views
of
the
police
and
detective
officials
of
the
twin
cities
are
hopelessly
divergent
each
side
asserts
thorough
familiarity
with
the
case
and
positive
conviction
regarding
the
guilty
parties
but
the
alleged
clews
proving
misleading
the
matter
is
finally
abandoned
the
passage
has
been
filled
with
cement
and
the
official
investigation
is
terminated
the
safety
of
my
comrades
sheds
a
ray
of
light
into
the
darkness
of
my
existence
it
is
consoling
to
reflect
that
disastrous
as
the
failure
is
to
myself
my
friends
will
not
be
made
victims
of
my
longing
for
liberty
at
no
time
since
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
has
suspicion
been
directed
to
the
right
persons
the
narrow
official
horizon
does
not
extend
beyond
the
familiar
names
of
the
girl
nold
and
bauer
these
have
been
pointed
at
by
the
accusing
finger
repeatedly
but
the
men
actually
concerned
in
the
secret
attempt
have
not
even
been
mentioned
no
danger
threatens
them
from
the
failure
of
my
plans
in
a
communication
to
a
local
newspaper
nold
has
incontrovertibly
proved
his
continuous
residence
in
louis
for
a
period
covering
a
year
previous
to
the
tunnel
and
afterwards
bauer
has
recently
married
at
no
time
have
the
police
been
in
ignorance
of
his
whereabouts
and
they
are
aware
that
my
former
is
to
be
discounted
as
a
participator
in
the
attempted
escape
indeed
the
prison
officials
must
have
learned
from
my
mail
that
the
big
german
is
regarded
by
my
friends
as
an
merely
but
the
suspicion
of
the
authorities
directed
toward
the
girl
with
a
pang
of
bitterness
i
think
of
her
unfortunate
absence
from
the
country
during
the
momentous
period
of
the
underground
work
with
resentment
i
reflect
that
but
for
that
i
might
now
be
at
liberty
her
skill
as
an
organizer
her
growing
influence
in
the
movement
her
energy
and
devotion
would
have
assured
the
success
of
the
undertaking
but
tony
unaccountable
delay
had
resulted
in
her
departure
without
learning
of
my
plans
it
is
to
him
to
his
obstinacy
and
conceit
that
the
failure
of
the
project
is
mostly
due
staunch
and
faithful
though
he
is
in
turn
i
lay
the
responsibility
at
the
door
of
this
friend
and
that
lashing
myself
into
furious
rage
at
the
renegade
who
had
appropriated
a
considerable
sum
of
the
money
intended
for
the
continuation
of
the
underground
work
yet
the
outbursts
of
passion
spent
i
strive
to
find
consolation
in
the
correctness
of
the
intuitive
judgment
that
prompted
the
selection
of
my
lawyers
the
devoted
comrades
who
so
heroically
toiled
for
my
sake
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
they
had
labored
through
the
weary
days
and
nights
stretched
at
full
length
in
the
narrow
passage
their
bodies
perspiring
and
chilled
in
turn
their
hands
bleeding
with
the
terrible
toil
and
through
the
weeks
and
months
of
work
and
confinement
in
the
tunnel
of
constant
dread
of
detection
and
anxiety
over
the
result
my
comrades
had
uttered
no
word
of
doubt
or
fear
in
full
reliance
upon
their
invisible
friend
what
in
behalf
of
one
whom
some
of
you
had
never
even
known
dear
beloved
comrades
had
you
succeeded
my
life
could
never
repay
your
almost
superhuman
efforts
and
love
only
the
future
years
of
active
devotion
to
our
great
common
cause
could
in
a
measure
express
my
thankfulness
and
pride
in
you
whoever
wherever
you
are
nor
were
your
heroism
your
skill
and
indomitable
perseverance
without
avail
you
have
given
an
invaluable
demonstration
of
the
elemental
reality
of
the
ideal
of
the
marvelous
strength
and
courage
born
of
solidaric
purpose
of
the
heights
devotion
to
a
great
cause
can
ascend
and
the
lesson
has
not
been
lost
almost
unanimous
is
the
voice
of
the
press
only
anarchists
could
have
achieved
the
wonderful
feat
the
subject
of
the
tunnel
fascinates
my
mind
how
little
thought
i
had
given
to
my
comrades
toiling
underground
in
the
anxious
days
of
my
own
apprehension
and
suspense
with
increasing
vividness
i
visualize
their
trepidation
the
constant
fear
of
discovery
the
herculean
efforts
in
spite
of
danger
how
terrible
must
have
been
despair
at
the
inability
to
continue
the
work
to
a
successful
termination
my
reflections
fill
me
with
renewed
strength
i
must
live
i
must
live
to
meet
those
heroic
men
to
take
them
by
the
hand
and
with
silent
lips
pour
my
heart
into
their
eyes
i
shall
be
proud
of
their
comradeship
and
strive
to
be
worthy
of
it
iii
the
lines
form
in
the
hallway
and
silently
march
to
the
shops
i
peer
through
the
bars
for
the
sight
of
a
familiar
face
brings
cheer
and
the
memory
of
the
days
on
the
range
many
friends
unseen
for
years
pass
by

how
big
jack
has
wasted
the
deep

sunk
in
the

so
strong

how
languid
and

is

imprisonment

at

when
i
read
his
marginal
note
upon
a
magazine
article
i
sent
him
concerning
the
stupendous
cost
of
crime
i
had
felt
quite
piqued
at
the
flippancy
of
his
comment
we
come
high
but
they
must
have
us
with
the
severe
intellectuality
of
revolutionary
tradition
i
thought
of
him
and
his
kind
as
inevitable
fungus
growths
the
rotten
fruit
of
a
decaying
society
unfortunate
derelicts
indeed
yet
parasites
almost
devoid
of
humanity
but
the
threads
of
comradeship
have
slowly
been
woven
by
common
misery
the
touch
of
sympathy
has
discovered
the
man
beneath
the
criminal
the
crust
of
sullen
suspicion
has
melted

of
kindness
warming

suffering
and

must
have
chilled
their

with
the

bitterness
and
the
resurrection
trembles
within
how
terrible
man
ignorance
that
forever
condemns
itself
to
be
scourged
by
its
own
blind
fury
and
these
my
friends

and
russell
these
innocently
guilty
what
worse
punishment
could
society
inflict
upon
itself
than
the
loss
of
their
latent
nobility
which
it
had
killed
not
entirely
in
vain
are
the
years
of
suffering
that
have
wakened

chapter
xxxix
a
new
plan
of
escape
i
my
new
neighbor
turns
my
thoughts
into
a
different
channel
it
is
fighting
tom
returned
after
several
years
of
absence
by
means
of
a
string
attached
to
a
wire
we
swing
notes
to
each
other
at
night
and
tom
startles
me
by
the
confession
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
mysterious
note
i
had
received
soon
after
my
arrival
in
the
penitentiary
an
escape
was
being
planned
he
informs
me
and
i
was
to
be
let
in
by
his
recommendation
but
one
of
the
conspirators
getting
cold
feet
the
plot
was
betrayed
to
the
warden
whereupon
tom
sent
the
snitch
to
the
hospital
as
a
result
however
he
was
kept
in
solitary
till
his
release
in
the
prison
he
had
become
proficient
as
a
and
it
was
his
intention
to
follow
the
trade
there
was
nothing
in
the
crooked
line
he
thought
and
he
resolved
to
be
honest
but
on
the
day
of
his
discharge
he
was
arrested
at
the
gate
by
officers
from
illinois
on
an
old
charge
he
swore
vengeance
against
assistant
deputy
hopkins
before
whom
he
had
once
accidentally
let
drop
the
remark
that
he
would
never
return
to
illinois
because
he
was
wanted
there
he
lived
the
five
years
in
the
joliet
prison
in
the
sole
hope
of
getting
square
with
the
man
who
had
so
meanly
betrayed
him
upon
his
release
he
returned
to
pittsburgh
determined
to
kill
hopkins
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
he
broke
into
the
latter
residence
prepared
to
avenge
his
wrongs
but
the
assistant
deputy
had
left
the
previous
day
on
his
vacation
furious
at
being
baffled
tom
was
about
to
set
fire
to
the
house
when
the
light
of
his
match
fell
upon
a
silver
trinket
on
the
bureau
of
the
bedroom
it
fascinated
him
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
it
suddenly
he
was
seized
with
the
desire
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
house
the
old
passion
was
upon
him
he
could
not
resist
hardly
conscious
of
his
actions
he
gathered
the
silverware
into
a
tablecloth
and
quietly
stole
out
of
the
house
he
was
arrested
the
next
day
as
he
was
trying
to
pawn
his
booty
an
old
offender
he
received
a
sentence
of
ten
years
since
his
arrival
eight
months
ago
he
has
been
kept
in
solitary
his
health
is
broken
he
has
no
hope
of
surviving
his
sentence
but
if
he
is
to
die
he
swears
he
is
going
to
take
his
man
along
aware
of
the
determination
of
fighting
tom
i
realize
that
the
safety
of
the
hated
officer
is
conditioned
by
tom
lack
of
opportunity
to
carry
out
his
revenge
i
feel
little
sympathy
for
hopkins
whose
craftiness
in
worming
out
the
secrets
of
prisoners
has
placed
him
on
the
of
the
pinkerton
agency
but
i
exert
myself
to
persuade
tom
that
it
would
be
sheer
insanity
thus
deliberately
to
put
his
head
in
the
noose
he
is
still
a
young
man
barely
thirty
it
is
not
worth
while
sacrificing
his
life
for
a
sneak
of
a
guard
however
tom
remains
stubborn
my
arguments
seem
merely
to
rouse
his
resistance
and
strengthen
his
resolution
but
closer
acquaintance
reveals
to
me
his
exceeding
conceit
over
his
art
and
technic
as
a
expert
i
play
upon
his
vanity
scoffing
at
the
crudity
of
his
plans
of
revenge
would
it
not
be
more
in
conformity
with
his
reputation
as
a
skilled
gun
i
argue
to
do
the
job
in
a
smoother
manner
tom
assumes
a
skeptical
attitude
but
by
degrees
grows
more
interested
presently
with
unexpected
enthusiasm
he
warms
to
the
suggestion
of
a
break
once
outside
well
i
get
all
right
he
chuckles
ii
the
plan
of
escape
completely
absorbs
us
on
alternate
nights
we
take
turns
in
timing
the
rounds
of
the
guards
the
appearance
of
the
night
captain
the
opening
of
the
rotunda
door
numerous
details
seemingly
insignificant
yet
potentially
fatal
are
to
be
mastered
many
obstacles
bar
the
way
of
success
but
time
and
perseverance
will
surmount
them
tom
is
thoroughly
engrossed
with
the
project
i
realize
the
desperation
of
the
undertaking
but
the
sole
alternative
is
slow
death
in
the
solitary
it
is
the
last
resort
with
utmost
care
we
make
our
preparations
the
summer
is
long
past
the
dense
fogs
of
the
season
will
aid
our
escape
we
hasten
to
complete
all
details
in
great
nervous
tension
with
the
excitement
of
the
work
the
time
is
drawing
near
for
deciding
upon
a
definite
date
but
tom
state
of
mind
fills
me
with
apprehension
he
has
become
taciturn
of
late
yesterday
he
seemed
peculiarly
glum
sullenly
refusing
to
answer
my
signal
again
and
again
i
knock
on
the
wall
calling
for
a
reply
to
my
last
note
tom
remains
silent
occasionally
a
heavy
groan
issues
from
his
cell
but
my
repeated
signals
remain
unanswered
in
alarm
i
stay
awake
all
night
in
the
hope
of
inducing
a
guard
to
investigate
the
cause
of
the
groaning
but
my
attempts
to
speak
to
the
officers
are
ignored
the
next
morning
i
behold
tom
carried
on
a
stretcher
from
his
cell
and
learn
with
horror
that
he
had
bled
to
death
during
the
night
iii
the
peculiar
death
of
my
friend
preys
on
my
mind
was
it
suicide
or
accident
tom
had
been
weakened
by
long
confinement
in
some
manner
he
may
have
ruptured
a
blood
vessel
dying
for
lack
of
medical
aid
it
is
hardly
probable
that
he
would
commit
suicide
on
the
eve
of
our
attempt
yet
certain
references
in
his
notes
of
late
ignored
at
the
time
assume
new
significance
he
was
apparently
under
the
delusion
that
hopkins
was
after
him
once
or
twice
my
friend
had
expressed
fear
for
his
safety
he
might
be
poisoned
he
hinted
i
had
laughed
the
matter
away
familiar
with
the
sporadic
delusions
of
men
in
solitary
close
confinement
exerts
a
similar
effect
upon
the
majority
of
prisoners
some
are
especially
predisposed
to
young
sid
used
to
manifest
every
symptom
of
the
diseases
he
read
about
perhaps
poor
tom
delusion
was
responsible
for
his
death
spencer
too
had
committed
suicide
a
month
before
his
release
in
the
firm
conviction
that
the
warden
would
not
permit
his
discharge
it
may
be
that
in
a
sudden
fit
of
despondency
tom
had
ended
his
life
perhaps
i
could
have
saved
my
friend
i
did
not
realize
how
constantly
he
brooded
over
the
danger
he
believed
himself
threatened
with
how
little
i
knew
of
the
terrible
struggle
that
must
have
been
going
on
in
his
tortured
heart
yet
we
were
so
intimate
i
believed
i
understood
his
every
feeling
and
emotion
the
thought
of
tom
possesses
my
mind
the
news
from
the
girl
about
bresci
execution
of
the
king
of
italy
rouses
little
interest
in
me
bresci
avenged
the
peasants
and
the
women
and
children
shot
before
the
palace
for
humbly
begging
bread
he
did
well
and
the
agitation
resulting
from
his
act
may
advance
the
cause
but
it
will
have
no
bearing
on
my
fate
the
last
hope
of
escape
has
departed
with
my
poor
friend
i
am
doomed
to
perish
here
and
bresci
will
perish
in
prison
but
the
comrades
will
eulogize
him
and
his
act
and
continue
their
efforts
to
regenerate
the
world
yet
i
feel
that
the
individual
in
certain
cases
is
of
more
direct
and
immediate
consequence
than
humanity
what
is
the
latter
but
the
aggregate
of
individual
existences
and
shall
these
the
best
of
them
forever
be
sacrificed
for
the
metaphysical
collectivity
here
all
around
me
a
thousand
unfortunates
daily
suffer
the
torture
of
calvary
forsaken
by
god
and
man
they
bleed
and
struggle
and
suicide
with
the
desperate
cry
for
a
little
sunshine
and
life
how
shall
they
be
helped
how
helped
amid
the
injustice
and
brutality
of
a
society
whose
chief
monuments
are
prisons
and
so
we
must
suffer
and
suicide
and
countless
others
after
us
till
the
play
of
social
forces
shall
transform
human
history
into
the
history
of
true
humanity
and
meanwhile
our
bones
will
bleach
on
the
long
dreary
road
bereft
of
the
last
hope
of
freedom
i
grow
indifferent
to
life
the
monotony
of
the
narrow
cell
daily
becomes
more
loathsome
my
whole
being
longs
for
rest
rest
no
more
to
awaken
the
world
will
not
miss
me
an
atom
of
matter
i
shall
return
to
endless
space
everything
will
pursue
its
wonted
course
but
i
shall
know
no
more
of
the
bitter
struggle
and
strife
my
friends
will
sorrow
and
yet
be
glad
my
pain
is
over
and
continue
on
their
way
and
new
brescis
will
arise
and
more
kings
will
fall
and
then
all
friend
and
enemy
will
go
my
way
and
new
generations
will
be
born
and
die
and
humanity
and
the
world
be
whirled
into
space
and
disappear
and
again
the
little
stage
will
be
set
and
the
same
history
and
the
same
facts
will
come
and
go
the
playthings
of
cosmic
forces
renewing
and
transforming
forever
how
insignificant
it
all
is
in
the
eye
of
reason
how
small
and
puny
life
and
all
its
pain
and
travail
with
eyes
closed
i
behold
myself
suspended
by
the
neck
from
the
upper
bars
of
the
cell
my
body
swings
gently
against
the
door
striking
it
softly
once
twice
just
like
pasquale
when
he
hanged
himself
in
the
cell
next
to
mine
some
months
ago
a
few
twitches
and
the
last
breath
is
gone
my
face
grows
livid
my
body
rigid
slowly
it
cools
the
night
guard
passes
what
this
eh
he
rings
the
rotunda
bell
keys
clang
the
lever
is
drawn
and
my
door
unlocked
an
officer
draws
a
knife
sharply
across
the
rope
at
the
bars
my
body
sinks
to
the
floor
my
head
striking
against
the
iron
bedstead
the
doctor
kneels

glad
of

the
warden
enters
a
grin
on
his
parchment
face
with
an
oath
i
spring
to
my
feet
in
terror
the
officers
rush
from
the
cell
ah
i
fooled

did

you

the
thought

the
embers

chapter
xl
done
to
death
i
in
my
utter
isolation
the
world
outside
appears
like
a
faint
memory
unreal
and
dim
the
deprivation
of
newspapers
has
entirely
severed
me
from
the
living
letters
from
my
comrades
have
become
rare
and
irregular
they
sound
strangely
cold
and
impersonal
the
life
of
the
prison
is
also
receding
no
communication
reaches
me
from
my
friends
pious
john
the
rangeman
is
unsympathetic
he
still
bears
me
ill
will
from
the
days
of
the
jail
only
young
russell
still
remembers
me
i
tremble
for
the
reckless
boy
as
i
hear
his
low
cough
apprising
me
of
the
stiff
he
unerringly
shoots
between
the
bars
while
the
double
file
of
prisoners
marches
past
my
door
he
looks
pale
and
haggard
the
old
buoyant
step
now
languid
and
heavy
a
tone
of
apprehension
pervades
his
notes
he
is
constantly
harassed
by
the
officers
he
writes
his
task
has
been
increased
he
is
nervous
and
weak
and
his
health
is
declining
in
the
broken
sentences
i
sense
some
vague
misgiving
as
of
impending
calamity
with
intense
thankfulness
i
think
of
russell
again
i
live
through
the
hopes
and
fears
that
drew
us
into
closer
friendship
the
days
of
terrible
anxiety
incident
to
the
tunnel
project
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
faithful
boy
whose
loyalty
and
discretion
have
so
much
aided
the
safety
of
my
comrades
a
strange
longing
for
his
companionship
possesses
me
in
the
gnawing
loneliness
his
face
floats
before
me
casting
the
spell
of
a
friendly
presence
his
strong
features
softened
by
sorrow
his
eyes
grown
large
with
the
same
sweet
sadness
of
little
felipe
a
peculiar
tenderness
steals
into
my
thoughts
of
the
boy
i
look
forward
eagerly
to
his
notes
impatiently
i
scan
the
faces
in
the
passing
line
wistful
for
the
sight
of
the
youth
and
my
heart
beats
faster
at
his
fleeting
smile
how
sorrowful
he
looks
now
he
is
gone
the
hours
are
weary
with
silence
and
solitude
listlessly
i
turn
the
pages
of
my
library
book
if
only
i
had
the
birds
i
should
find
solace
in
their
thoughtful
eyes
dick
and
sis
would
understand
and
feel
with
me
but
my
poor
little
friends
have
disappeared
only
russell
remains
my
only
friend
i
shall
not
see
him
when
he
returns
to
the
cell
at
noon
the
line
passes
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
but
in
the
afternoon
when
the
men
are
again
unlocked
for
work
i
shall
look
into
his
eyes
for
a
happy
moment
and
perhaps
the
dear
boy
will
have
a
message
for
me
he
is
so
his
correspondence
is
full
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
and
he
strives
to
cheer
me
with
the
good
news
another
day
is
gone
his
sentence
is
nearing
its
end
he
will
at
once
secure
a
position
and
save
every
penny
to
aid
in
my
release
tacitly
i
concur
in
his
ardent
hope
it
would
break
his
heart
to
be
disillusioned
ii
the
passing
weeks
and
months
bring
no
break
in
the
dreary
monotony
the
call
of
the
robin
on
the
river
bank
rouses
no
echo
in
my
heart
no
sign
of
awakening
spring
brightens
the
constant
of
the
solitary
the
dampness
of
the
cell
is
piercing
my
bones
every
movement
racks
my
body
with
pain
my
eyes
are
tortured
with
the
eternal
white
of
the
walls
sombre
shadows
brood
around
me
i
long
for
a
bit
of
sunshine
i
wait
patiently
at
the
door
perhaps
it
is
clear
my
cell
faces
west
may
be
the
setting
sun
will
steal
a
glance
upon
me
for
hours
i
stand
with
naked
breast
close
to
the
bars
i
must
not
miss
a
friendly
ray
it
may
suddenly
peep
into
the
cell
and
turn
away
from
me
unseen
in
the
gloom
now
a
bright
beam
plays
on
my
neck
and
shoulders
and
i
press
closer
to
the
door
to
welcome
the
dear
stranger
he
caresses
me
with
soft
touch
perhaps
it
is
the
soul
of
little
dick
pouring
out
his
tender
greeting
in
this
song
of
light
or
may
be
the
astral
aura
of
my
beloved
uncle
maxim
bringing
warmth
and
hope
sweet
conceit
of
oriental
thought
barren
of
joy
in
life
the
sun
is
fading
it
feels
chilly
in
the
twilight
and
now
the
solitary
is
once
more
bleak
and
cold
as
his
release
approaches
the
tone
of
native
confidence
becomes
more
assertive
in
russell
letter
the
boy
is
jubilant
and
full
of
vitality
within
three
months
he
will
breathe
the
air
of
freedom
a
note
of
sadness
at
leaving
me
behind
permeates
his
communications
but
he
is
enthusiastic
over
his
project
of
aiding
me
to
liberty
eagerly
every
day
i
anticipate
his
mute
greeting
as
he
passes
in
the
line
this
morning
i
saw
him
hold
up
two
fingers
the
third
crooked
in
sign
of
the
remaining
two
and
a
stump
a
joyous
light
is
in
his
eyes
his
step
firmer
more
elastic
but
in
the
afternoon
he
is
missing
from
the
line
with
sudden
apprehension
i
wonder
at
his
absence
could
i
have
overlooked
him
in
the
closely
walking
ranks
it
is
barely
possible
perhaps
he
has
remained
in
the
cell
not
feeling
well
it
may
be
nothing
serious
he
will
surely
be
in
line
for
three
days
every
morning
and
afternoon
i
anxiously
scrutinize
the
faces
of
the
passing
men
but
russell
is
not
among
them
his
absence
torments
me
with
a
thousand
fears
may
be
the
warden
has
renewed
his
inquisition
of
the
boy
perhaps
he
got
into
a
fight
in
the
shop
in
the
dungeon
now
he
lose
his
commutation
time
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
i
am
about
to
appeal
to
the
chaplain
when
a
friendly
runner
surreptitiously
hands
me
a
note
with
difficulty
i
recognize
my
friend
bold
handwriting
in
the
uneven
nervous
scrawl
russell
is
in
the
hospital
at
work
in
the
shop
he
writes
he
had
suffered
a
chill
the
doctor
committed
him
to
the
ward
for
observation
but
the
officers
and
the
convict
nurses
accuse
him
of
shamming
to
evade
work
they
threaten
to
have
him
returned
to
the
shop
and
he
implores
me
to
have
the
chaplain
intercede
for
him
he
feels
weak
and
feverish
and
the
thought
of
being
left
alone
in
the
cell
in
his
present
condition
fills
him
with
horror
i
send
an
urgent
request
to
see
the
chaplain
but
the
guard
informs
me
that
milligan
is
absent
he
is
not
expected
at
the
office
till
the
following
week
i
prevail
upon
the
kindly
mitchell
recently
transferred
to
the
south
block
to
deliver
a
note
to
the
warden
in
which
i
appeal
on
behalf
of
russell
but
several
days
pass
and
still
no
reply
from
captain
wright
finally
i
pretend
severe
pains
in
the
bowels
to
afford
frank
the
doctor
assistant
an
opportunity
to
pause
at
my
cell
as
the
medicine
boy
pours
the
prescribed
pint
of
horse
salts
through
the
funnel
inserted
between
the
bars
i
hastily
inquire
is
russell
still
in
the
ward
frank
how
is
he
what
russell
he
asks
indifferently
russell
schroyer
put
four
days
ago
under
observation
oh
that
poor
kid
why
he
is
paralyzed
for
an
instant
i
am
speechless
with
terror

it
can
not
be
some
mistake
frank

the
construction
shop

friend
russell

know
who
you
mean

boy

ca
be
why
frank

was
just
a
chill
and
a
little
weakness

you
can
keep
a
secret
all
right
i
tell
you
something
if
you

away
yes
yes
frank
what
is
it
sh
sh
you
know
flem
the
night
nurse
doing
a
five
spot
for
murder
his
father
and
the
warden
are
old
cronies
that
how
he
got
to
be
nurse
do
know
a
damn
thing
about
it
an
careless
as
hell
always
makes
mistakes
well
doc
ordered
an
injection
for
russell
now
ever
say
i
told
you
flem
got
the
wrong
bottle
gave
the
poor
boy
some
acid
in
the
injection
paralyzed
the
kid
he
did
the
damn
murderer
i
pass
the
night
in
anguish
clutching
desperately
at
the
faint
hope
that
it
can
not
be
some
mistake
perhaps
frank
has
exaggerated
but
in
the
morning
the
medicine
boy
confirms
my
worst
fears
the
doctor
has
said
the
boy
will
die
russell
does
not
realize
the
situation
there
is
something
wrong
with
his
legs
the
poor
boy
writes
he
is
unable
to
move
them
and
suffers
great
pain
it
ca
be
fever
he
thinks
but
the
physician
will
not
tell
him
what
is
the
matter
the
kindly
frank
is
sympathetic
every
day
he
passes
notes
between
us
and
i
try
to
encourage
russell
he
will
improve
i
assure
him
his
time
is
short
and
fresh
air
and
liberty
will
soon
restore
him
my
words
seem
to
soothe
my
friend
and
he
grows
more
cheerful
when
unexpectedly
he
learns
the
truth
from
the
wrangling
nurses
his
notes
grow
piteous
with
misery
tears
fill
my
eyes
as
i
read
his
despairing
cry
oh
aleck
i
am
so
young
i
do
want
to
die
he
implores
me
to
visit
him
if
i
could
only
come
to
nurse
him
he
is
sure
he
would
improve
he
distrusts
the
convict
attendants
who
harry
and
banter
the
country
lad
their
heartless
abuse
is
irritating
the
sick
boy
beyond
patience
exasperated
by
the
taunts
of
the
night
nurse
russell
yesterday
threw
a
saucer
at
him
he
was
reported
to
the
doctor
who
threatened
to
send
the
paralyzed
youth
to
the
dungeon
plagued
and
tormented
in
great
suffering
russell
grows
bitter
and
complaining
the
nurses
and
officers
are
persecuting
him
he
writes
they
will
soon
do
him
to
death
if
i
will
not
come
to
his
rescue
if
he
could
go
to
an
outside
hospital
he
is
sure
to
recover
every
evening
frank
brings
sadder
news
russell
is
feeling
worse
he
is
so
nervous
the
doctor
has
ordered
the
nurses
to
wear
slippers
the
doors
in
the
ward
have
been
lined
with
cotton
to
deaden
the
noise
of
slamming
but
even
the
sight
of
a
moving
figure
throws
russell
into
convulsions
there
is
no
hope
frank
reports
decomposition
has
already
set
in
the
boy
is
in
terrible
agony
he
is
constantly
crying
with
pain
and
calling
for
me
distraught
with
anxiety
and
yearning
to
see
my
sick
friend
i
resolve
upon
a
way
to
visit
the
hospital
in
the
morning
as
the
guard
hands
me
the
bread
ration
and
shuts
my
cell
i
slip
my
hand
between
the
sill
and
door
with
an
involuntary
cry
i
withdraw
my
maimed
and
bleeding
fingers
the
overseer
conducts
me
to
the
dispensary
by
tacit
permission
of
the
friendly
medicine
boy
i
pass
to
the
second
floor
where
the
wards
are
located
and
quickly
steal
to
russell
bedside
the
look
of
mute
joy
on
the
agonized
face
subdues
the
excruciating
pain
in
my
hand
oh
dear
aleck
he
whispers
i
so
glad
they
let
you
come
i
get
well
if
you
nurse
me
the
shadow
of
death
is
in
his
eyes
the
body
exudes
decomposition
bereft
of
speech
i
gently
press
his
white
emaciated
hand
the
weary
eyes
close
and
the
boy
falls
into
slumber
silently
i
touch
his
dry
lips
and
steal
away
in
the
afternoon
i
appeal
to
the
warden
to
permit
me
to
nurse
my
friend
it
is
the
boy
dying
wish
it
will
ease
his
last
hours
the
captain
refers
me
to
the
inspectors
but
reed
informs
me
that
it
would
be
subversive
of
discipline
to
grant
my
request
thereupon
i
ask
permission
to
arrange
a
collection
among
the
prisoners
russell
firmly
believes
that
he
would
improve
in
an
outside
hospital
and
the
pardon
board
might
grant
the
petition
friendless
prisoners
are
often
allowed
to
circulate
subscription
lists
among
the
inmates
and
two
years
previously
i
had
collected
a
hundred
and
dollars
for
the
pardon
of
a
lifetimer
but
the
warden
curtly
refuses
my
plea
remarking
that
it
is
dangerous
to
permit
me
to
associate
with
the
men
i
suggest
the
chaplain
for
the
mission
or
some
prisoner
selected
by
the
authorities
but
this
offer
is
also
vetoed
the
warden
berating
me
for
having
taken
advantage
of
my
presence
in
the
dispensary
to
see
russell
clandestinely
and
threatening
to
punish
me
with
the
dungeon
i
plead
with
him
for
permission
to
visit
the
sick
boy
who
is
hungry
for
a
friendly
presence
and
constantly
calling
for
me
apparently
touched
by
my
emotion
the
captain
yields
he
will
permit
me
to
visit
russell
he
informs
me
on
condition
that
a
guard
be
present
at
the
meeting
for
a
moment
i
hesitate
the
desire
to
see
my
friend
struggles
against
the
fear
of
irritating
him
by
the
sight
of
the
hated
uniform
but
i
can
not
expose
the
dying
youth
to
this
indignity
and
pain
angered
by
my
refusal
perhaps
disappointed
in
the
hope
of
learning
the
secret
of
the
tunnel
from
the
visit
the
warden
forbids
me
hereafter
to
enter
the
hospital
late
at
night
frank
appears
at
my
cell
he
looks
very
grave
as
he
whispers
aleck
you
must
bear
up
russell
yes
aleck
worse
tell
me
frank
he
is
dead
bear
up
aleck
his
last
thought
was
of
you
he
was
unconscious
all
afternoon
but
just
before
the
end
it
was
he
sat
up
in
bed
so
suddenly
he
frightened
me
his
arm
shot
out
and
he
cried
bye
aleck
chapter
xli
the
shock
at
buffalo
i
july
dear
girl
this
is
from
the
hospital
just
out
of
the
after
eight
days
for
over
a
year
i
was
in
the
strictest
solitary
for
a
long
time
mail
and
reading
matter
were
denied
me
i
have
no
words
to
describe
the
horror
of
the
last
months
i
have
passed
through
a
great
crisis
two
of
my
best
friends
died
in
a
frightful
manner
the
death
of
russell
especially
affected
me
he
was
very
young
and
my
dearest
and
most
devoted
friend
and
he
died
a
terrible
death
the
doctor
charged
the
boy
with
shamming
but
now
he
says
it
was
spinal
meningitis
i
can
not
tell
you
the
awful
truth
it
was
nothing
short
of
murder
and
my
poor
friend
rotted
away
by
inches
when
he
died
they
found
his
back
one
mass
of
bedsores
if
you
could
read
the
pitiful
letters
he
wrote
begging
to
see
me
and
to
be
nursed
by
me
but
the
warden
would
permit
it
in
some
manner
his
agony
seemed
to
affect
me
and
i
began
to
experience
the
pains
and
symptoms
that
russell
described
in
his
notes
i
knew
it
was
my
sick
fancy
i
strove
against
it
but
presently
my
legs
showed
signs
of
paralysis
and
i
suffered
excruciating
pain
in
the
spinal
column
just
like
russell
i
was
afraid
that
i
would
be
done
to
death
like
my
poor
friend
i
grew
suspicious
of
every
guard
and
would
barely
touch
the
food
for
fear
of
its
being
poisoned
my
head
was
workin
they
said
and
all
the
time
i
knew
it
was
my
diseased
imagination
and
i
was
in
terror
of
going
mad
i
tried
so
hard
to
fight
it
but
it
would
always
creep
up
and
get
hold
of
me
stronger
and
stronger
another
week
of
solitary
would
have
killed
me
i
was
on
the
verge
of
suicide
i
demanded
to
be
relieved
from
the
cell
and
the
warden
ordered
me
punished
i
was
put
in
the
they
bound
my
body
in
canvas
strapped
my
arms
to
the
bed
and
chained
my
feet
to
the
posts
i
was
kept
that
way
eight
days
unable
to
move
rotting
in
my
own
excrement
released
prisoners
called
the
attention
of
our
new
inspector
to
my
case
he
refused
to
believe
that
such
things
were
being
done
in
the
penitentiary
reports
spread
that
i
was
going
blind
and
insane
then
the
inspector
visited
the
hospital
and
had
me
released
from
the
jacket
i
am
in
pretty
bad
shape
but
they
put
me
in
the
general
ward
now
and
i
am
glad
of
the
chance
to
send
you
this
note
sasha
ii
direct
to
box
a
allegheny
city
july
dear
sonya
i
can
not
tell
you
how
happy
i
am
to
be
allowed
to
write
to
you
again
my
privileges
have
been
restored
by
our
new
inspector
a
very
kindly
man
he
has
relieved
me
from
the
cell
and
now
i
am
again
on
the
range
the
inspector
requested
me
to
deny
to
my
friends
the
reports
which
have
recently
appeared
in
the
papers
concerning
my
condition
i
have
not
been
well
of
late
but
now
i
hope
to
improve
my
eyes
are
very
poor
the
inspector
has
given
me
permission
to
have
a
specialist
examine
them
please
arrange
for
it
through
our
local
comrades
there
is
another
piece
of
very
good
news
dear
friend
a
new
commutation
law
has
been
passed
which
reduces
my
sentence
by
years
it
still
leaves
me
a
long
time
of
course
almost
years
here
and
another
year
to
the
workhouse
however
it
is
a
considerable
gain
and
if
i
should
not
get
into
solitary
again
i
may
i
am
almost
afraid
to
utter
the
thought
i
may
live
to
come
out
i
feel
as
if
i
am
being
resurrected
the
new
law
benefits
the
proportionately
much
more
than
the
men
with
longer
sentences
only
the
poor
lifers
do
not
share
in
it
we
were
very
anxious
for
a
while
as
there
were
many
rumors
that
the
law
would
be
declared
unconstitutional
fortunately
the
attempt
to
nullify
its
benefits
proved
ineffectual
think
of
men
who
will
see
something
unconstitutional
in
allowing
the
prisoners
a
little
more
good
time
than
the
commutation
statute
of
years
ago
as
if
a
little
kindness
to
the
unfortunates
really
justice
is
incompatible
with
the
spirit
of
jefferson
we
were
greatly
worried
over
the
fate
of
this
statute
but
at
last
the
first
batch
has
been
released
and
there
is
much
rejoicing
over
it
there
is
a
peculiar
history
about
this
new
law
which
may
interest
you
it
sheds
a
significant
side
light
it
was
especially
designed
for
the
benefit
of
a
high
federal
officer
who
was
recently
convicted
of
aiding
two
wealthy
philadelphia
tobacco
manufacturers
to
defraud
the
government
of
a
few
millions
by
using
counterfeit
tax
stamps
their
influence
secured
the
introduction
of
the
commutation
bill
and
its
hasty
passage
the
law
would
have
cut
their
sentences
almost
in
two
but
certain
newspapers
seem
to
have
taken
offence
at
having
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
deal
and
protests
began
to
be
voiced
the
matter
finally
came
up
before
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
who
decided
that
the
men
in
whose
special
interest
the
law
was
engineered
could
not
benefit
by
it
because
a
state
law
does
not
affect
prisoners
the
latter
being
subject
to
the
federal
commutation
act
imagine
the
discomfiture
of
the
politicians
an
attempt
was
even
made
to
suspend
the
operation
of
the
statute
fortunately
it
failed
and
now
the
common
state
prisoners
who
were
not
at
all
meant
to
profit
are
being
released
the
legislature
has
unwittingly
given
some
unfortunates
here
much
happiness
i
was
interrupted
in
this
writing
by
being
called
out
for
a
visit
i
could
hardly
credit
it
the
first
comrade
i
have
been
allowed
to
see
in
nine
years
it
was
harry
gordon
and
i
was
so
overcome
by
the
sight
of
the
dear
friend
i
could
barely
speak
he
must
have
prevailed
upon
the
new
inspector
to
issue
a
permit
the
latter
is
now
acting
warden
owing
to
the
serious
illness
of
captain
wright
perhaps
he
will
allow
me
to
see
my
sister
will
you
kindly
communicate
with
her
at
once
meantime
i
shall
try
to
secure
a
pass
with
renewed
hope
and
always
with
green
memory
of
you
alex
iii
dearest
girl
i
know
how
your
visit
and
my
strange
behavior
have
affected
you
the
sight
of
your
face
after
all
these
years
completely
unnerved
me
i
could
not
think
i
could
not
speak
it
was
as
if
all
my
dreams
of
freedom
the
whole
world
of
the
living
were
concentrated
in
the
shiny
little
trinket
that
was
dangling
from
your
watch
chain
i
could
take
my
eyes
off
it
i
keep
my
hand
from
playing
with
it
it
absorbed
my
whole
being
and
all
the
time
i
felt
how
nervous
you
were
at
my
silence
and
i
could
utter
a
word
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
not
to
have
seen
each
other
under
the
present
conditions
it
was
lucky
they
did
not
recognize
you
they
took
you
for
my
sister
though
i
believe
your
identity
was
suspected
after
you
had
left
you
would
surely
not
have
been
permitted
the
visit
had
the
old
warden
been
here
he
was
ill
at
the
time
he
never
got
over
the
shock
of
the
tunnel
and
finally
he
has
been
persuaded
by
the
prison
physician
who
has
secret
aspirations
to
the
wardenship
that
the
anxieties
of
his
position
are
a
menace
to
his
advanced
age
considerable
dissatisfaction
has
also
developed
of
late
against
the
warden
among
the
inspectors
well
he
has
resigned
at
last
thank
goodness
the
prisoners
have
been
praying
for
it
for
years
and
some
of
the
boys
on
the
range
celebrated
the
event
by
getting
drunk
on
wood
alcohol
the
new
warden
has
just
assumed
charge
and
we
hope
for
improvement
he
is
a
physician
by
profession
with
the
title
of
major
in
the
pennsylvania
militia
it
was
entirely
uncalled
for
on
the
part
of
the
officious
friend
whoever
he
may
have
been
to
cause
you
unnecessary
worry
over
my
health
and
my
renewed
persecution
you
remember
that
in
july
the
new
inspector
released
me
from
the
and
assigned
me
to
work
on
the
range
but
i
was
locked
up
again
in
october
after
the
mckinley
incident
the
president
of
the
board
of
inspectors
was
at
the
time
in
new
york
he
inquired
by
wire
what
i
was
doing
upon
being
informed
that
i
was
working
on
the
range
he
ordered
me
into
solitary
the
new
warden
on
assuming
office
sent
for
me
they
give
you
a
bad
reputation
he
said
but
i
will
let
you
out
of
the
cell
if
you
promise
to
do
what
is
right
by
me
he
spoke
brusquely
in
the
manner
of
a
man
closing
a
business
deal
with
the
power
of
dictating
terms
he
reminded
me
of
bismarck
at
versailles
yet
he
did
not
seem
unkind
the
thought
of
escape
was
probably
in
his
mind
but
the
new
law
has
germinated
the
hope
of
survival
my
weakened
condition
and
the
unexpected
shortening
of
my
sentence
have
at
last
decided
me
to
abandon
the
idea
of
escape
i
therefore
replied
to
the
warden
i
will
do
what
is
right
by
you
if
you
treat
right
thereupon
he
assigned
me
to
work
on
the
range
it
is
almost
like
liberty
to
have
the
freedom
of
the
after
the
close
solitary
and
you
dear
friend
in
your
letters
i
feel
how
terribly
torn
you
are
by
the
events
of
the
recent
months
i
lived
in
great
fear
for
your
safety
and
i
can
barely
credit
the
good
news
that
you
are
at
liberty
it
seems
almost
a
miracle
i
followed
the
newspapers
with
great
anxiety
the
whole
country
seemed
to
be
swept
with
the
fury
of
revenge
to
a
considerable
extent
the
press
fanned
the
fires
of
persecution
here
in
the
prison
very
little
sincere
grief
was
manifested
out
out
of
hearing
of
the
guards
the
men
passed
very
uncomplimentary
remarks
about
the
dead
president
the
average
prisoner
corresponds
to
the
average
citizen
their
patriotism
is
very
passive
except
when
stimulated
by
personal
interest
or
artificially
excited
but
if
the
press
mirrored
the
sentiment
of
the
people
the
nation
must
have
suddenly
relapsed
into
cannibalism
there
were
moments
when
i
was
in
mortal
dread
for
your
very
life
and
for
the
safety
of
the
other
arrested
comrades
in
previous
letters
you
hinted
that
it
was
official
rivalry
and
jealousy
and
your
absence
from
new
york
to
which
you
owe
your
release
you
may
be
right
yet
i
believe
that
your
attitude
of
proud
and
your
admirable
contributed
much
to
the
result
you
were
splendid
dear
and
i
was
especially
moved
by
your
remark
that
you
would
faithfully
nurse
the
wounded
man
if
he
required
your
services
but
that
the
poor
boy
condemned
and
deserted
by
all
needed
and
deserved
your
sympathy
and
aid
more
than
the
president
more
strikingly
than
your
letters
that
remark
discovered
to
me
the
great
change
wrought
in
us
by
the
ripening
years
yes
in
us
in
both
for
my
heart
echoed
your
beautiful
sentiment
how
impossible
such
a
thought
would
have
been
to
us
in
the
days
of
a
decade
ago
we
should
have
considered
it
treason
to
the
spirit
of
revolution
it
would
have
outraged
all
our
traditions
even
to
admit
the
humanity
of
an
official
representative
of
capitalism
is
it
not
very
significant
that
we
two
you
living
in
the
very
heart
of
anarchist
thought
and
activity
and
i
in
the
atmosphere
of
absolute
suppression
and
solitude
should
have
arrived
at
the
same
evolutionary
point
after
a
decade
of
divergent
paths
you
have
alluded
in
a
recent
letter
to
the
ennobling
and
broadening
influence
of
sorrow
yet
not
upon
every
one
does
it
exert
a
similar
effect
some
natures
grow
embittered
and
shrink
with
the
poison
of
misery
i
often
wonder
at
my
lack
of
bitterness
and
enmity
even
against
the
old
warden
and
surely
i
have
good
cause
to
hate
him
is
it
because
of
greater
maturity
i
rather
think
it
is
temperamentally
conditioned
the
love
of
the
people
the
hatred
of
oppression
of
our
younger
days
vital
as
these
sentiments
were
with
us
were
mental
rather
than
emotional
fortunately
so
i
think
for
those
like
fedya
and
lewis
and
pauline
and
numerous
others
soon
have
their
emotionally
inflated
idealism
punctured
on
the
thorny
path
of
the
social
protestant
only
aspirations
that
spontaneously
leap
from
the
depths
of
our
soul
persist
in
the
face
of
antagonistic
forces
the
revolutionist
is
born
beneath
our
love
and
hatred
of
former
days
lay
inherent
rebellion
and
the
passionate
desire
for
liberty
and
life
in
the
long
years
of
isolation
i
have
looked
deeply
into
my
heart
with
open
mind
and
sincere
purpose
i
have
revised
every
emotion
and
every
thought
away
from
my
former
atmosphere
and
the
disturbing
influence
of
the
world
turmoil
i
have
divested
myself
of
all
traditions
and
accepted
beliefs
i
have
studied
the
sciences
and
the
humanities
contemplated
life
and
pondered
over
human
destiny
for
weeks
and
months
i
would
be
absorbed
in
the
domain
of
pure
reason
or
discuss
with
leibnitz
the
question
of
free
will
and
seek
to
penetrate
beyond
spencer
into
the
unknowable
political
science
and
economics
law
and
criminology
i
studied
them
with
unprejudiced
mind
and
sought
to
slacken
my
soul
thirst
by
delving
deeply
into
religion
and
theology
seeking
the
key
to
life
at
the
feet
of
eddy
expectantly
listening
for
the
voice
of
disembodied
studying
koreshanity
and
theosophy
absorbing
the
of
knowledge
and
power
and
concentrating
upon
the
wisdom
of
the
yogi
and
after
years
of
contemplation
and
study
chastened
by
much
sorrow
and
suffering
i
arise
from
the
broken
fetters
of
the
world
folly
and
delusions
to
behold
the
threshold
of
a
new
life
of
liberty
and
equality
my
youth
ideal
of
a
free
humanity
in
the
vague
future
has
become
clarified
and
crystallized
into
the
living
truth
of
anarchy
as
the
sustaining
elemental
force
of
my
existence
often
i
have
wondered
in
the
years
gone
by
was
not
wisdom
dear
at
the
price
of
enthusiasm
at
one
is
not
so
reckless
not
so
fanatical
and
as
at
with
maturity
we
become
more
universal
but
life
is
a
shylock
that
can
not
be
cheated
of
his
due
for
every
lesson
it
teaches
us
we
have
a
wound
or
a
scar
to
show
we
grow
broader
but
too
often
the
heart
contracts
as
the
mind
expands
and
the
fires
are
burning
down
while
we
are
learning
at
such
moments
my
mind
would
revert
to
the
days
when
the
momentarily
expected
approach
of
the
social
revolution
absorbed
our
exclusive
interest
the
raging
present
and
its
conflicting
currents
passed
us
by
while
our
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
dawn
in
thrilling
expectancy
of
the
sunrise
life
and
its
manifold
expressions
were
vexatious
to
the
spirit
of
revolt
and
poetry
literature
and
art
were
scorned
as
hindrances
to
progress
unless
they
sounded
the
tocsin
of
immediate
revolution
humanity
was
sharply
divided
in
two
warring
camps
the
noble
people
the
producers
who
yearned
for
the
light
of
the
new
gospel
and
the
hated
oppressors
the
exploiters
who
craftily
strove
to
obscure
the
rising
day
that
was
to
give
back
to
man
his
heritage
if
only
the
good
people
were
given
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
great
truth
how
joyfully
they
would
embrace
anarchy
and
walk
in
triumph
into
the
promised
land
the
splendid
naivety
of
the
days
that
resented
as
a
personal
reflection
the
least
misgiving
of
the
future
the
enthusiasm
that
discounted
the
power
of
inherent
prejudice
and
predilection
magnificent
was
the
day
of
hearts
on
fire
with
the
hatred
of
oppression
and
the
love
of
liberty
woe
indeed
to
the
man
or
the
people
whose
soul
never
warmed
with
the
spark
of
prometheus
for
it
is
youth
that
has
climbed
the
heights
but
maturity
has
clarified
the
way
and
the
stupendous
task
of
human
regeneration
will
be
accomplished
only
by
the
purified
vision
of
hearts
that
grow
not
cold
and
you
my
dear
friend
with
the
deeper
insight
of
time
you
have
yet
happily
kept
your
heart
young
i
have
rejoiced
at
it
in
your
letters
of
recent
years
and
it
is
especially
evident
from
the
sentiments
you
have
expressed
regarding
the
happening
at
buffalo
i
share
your
view
entirely
for
that
very
reason
it
is
the
more
distressing
to
disagree
with
you
in
one
very
important
particular
the
value
of
leon
act
i
know
the
terrible
ordeal
you
have
passed
through
the
fiendish
persecution
to
which
you
have
been
subjected
worse
than
all
must
have
been
to
you
the
general
lack
of
understanding
for
such
phenomena
and
sadder
yet
the
despicable
attitude
of
some
radicals
in
denouncing
the
man
and
his
act
but
i
am
confident
you
will
not
mistake
my
expressed
disagreement
for
condemnation
we
need
not
discuss
the
phase
of
the
which
manifested
the
rebellion
of
a
tortured
soul
the
individual
protest
against
social
wrong
such
phenomena
are
the
natural
result
of
evil
conditions
as
inevitable
as
the
flooding
of
the
river
banks
by
the
swelling
mountain
torrents
but
i
can
not
agree
with
you
regarding
the
social
value
of
leon
act
i
have
read
of
the
beautiful
personality
of
the
youth
of
his
inability
to
adapt
himself
to
brutal
conditions
and
the
rebellion
of
his
soul
it
throws
a
significant
light
upon
the
causes
of
the
indeed
it
is
at
once
the
greatest
tragedy
of
martyrdom
and
the
most
terrible
indictment
of
society
that
it
forces
the
noblest
men
and
women
to
shed
human
blood
though
their
souls
shrink
from
it
but
the
more
imperative
it
is
that
drastic
methods
of
this
character
be
resorted
to
only
as
a
last
extremity
to
prove
of
value
they
must
be
motived
by
social
rather
than
individual
necessity
and
be
directed
against
a
real
and
immediate
enemy
of
the
people
the
significance
of
such
a
deed
is
understood
by
the
popular
mind
and
in
that
alone
is
the
propagandistic
educational
importance
of
an
except
if
it
is
exclusively
an
act
of
terrorism
now
i
do
not
believe
that
this
deed
was
terroristic
and
i
doubt
whether
it
was
educational
because
the
social
necessity
for
its
performance
was
not
manifest
that
you
may
not
misunderstand
i
repeat
as
an
expression
of
personal
revolt
it
was
inevitable
and
in
itself
an
indictment
of
existing
conditions
but
the
background
of
social
necessity
was
lacking
and
therefore
the
value
of
the
act
was
to
a
great
extent
nullified
in
russia
where
political
oppression
is
popularly
felt
such
a
deed
would
be
of
great
value
but
the
scheme
of
political
subjection
is
more
subtle
in
america
and
though
mckinley
was
the
chief
representative
of
our
modern
slavery
he
could
not
be
considered
in
the
light
of
a
direct
and
immediate
enemy
of
the
people
while
in
an
absolutism
the
autocrat
is
visible
and
tangible
the
real
despotism
of
republican
institutions
is
far
deeper
more
insidious
because
it
rests
on
the
popular
delusion
of
and
independence
that
is
the
subtle
source
of
democratic
tyranny
and
as
such
it
can
not
be
reached
with
a
bullet
in
modern
capitalism
exploitation
rather
than
oppression
is
the
real
enemy
of
the
people
oppression
is
but
its
handmaid
hence
the
battle
is
to
be
waged
in
the
economic
rather
than
the
political
field
it
is
therefore
that
i
regard
my
own
act
as
far
more
significant
and
educational
than
leon
it
was
directed
against
a
tangible
real
oppressor
visualized
as
such
by
the
people
as
long
as
misery
and
tyranny
fill
the
world
social
contrasts
and
consequent
hatreds
will
persist
and
the
noblest
of
the
race
our
czolgoszes
burst
forth
in
rockets
of
iron
but
does
this
lightning
really
illumine
the
social
horizon
or
merely
confuse
minds
with
the
succeeding
darkness
the
struggle
of
labor
against
capital
is
a
class
war
essentially
and
chiefly
economic
in
that
arena
the
battles
must
be
fought
it
was
not
these
considerations
of
course
that
inspired
the
or
the
attitude
even
of
alleged
radicals
their
cowardice
has
filled
me
with
loathing
and
sadness
the
brutal
farce
of
the
trial
the
hypocrisy
of
the
whole
proceeding
the
thirst
for
the
blood
of
the
martyr
these
make
one
almost
despair
of
humanity
i
must
close
the
friend
to
smuggle
out
this
letter
will
be
uneasy
about
its
bulk
send
me
sign
of
receipt
and
i
hope
that
you
may
be
permitted
a
little
rest
and
peace
to
recover
from
the
nightmare
of
the
last
months
sasha
chapter
xlii
marred
lives
i
the
discussion
with
the
girl
is
a
source
of
much
mortification
harassed
on
every
side
persecuted
by
the
authorities
and
hounded
even
into
the
street
my
friend
in
her
hour
of
bitterness
confounds
my
appreciative
disagreement
with
the
denunciation
of
stupidity
and
inertia
i
realize
the
inadequacy
of
the
written
word
and
despair
at
the
hopelessness
of
human
understanding
as
i
vainly
seek
to
elucidate
the
meaning
of
the
buffalo
tragedy
to
friendly
guards
and
prisoners
continued
correspondence
with
the
girl
accentuates
the
divergence
of
our
views
painfully
discovering
the
fundamental
difference
of
attitude
underlying
even
common
conclusions
by
degrees
the
stress
of
activities
reacts
upon
my
correspondence
our
discussion
lags
and
soon
ceases
entirely
the
world
of
the
outside
temporarily
brought
closer
again
recedes
and
the
urgency
of
the
immediate
absorbs
me
in
the
life
of
the
prison
ii
a
spirit
of
hopefulness
breathes
in
the
the
new
commutation
law
is
bringing
liberty
appreciably
nearer
in
the
shops
and
yard
the
men
excitedly
discuss
the
increased
good
time
and
prisoners
flit
about
with
paper
and
pencil
seeking
a
tutored
friend
to
figure
out
their
time
of
release
even
the
solitaries
on
the
verge
of
despair
and
the
facing
a
vista
of
cheerless
years
are
instilled
with
new
courage
and
hope
the
tenor
of
conversation
is
altered
with
the
appointment
of
the
new
warden
the
constant
grumbling
over
the
food
has
ceased
pleasant
surprise
is
manifest
at
the
welcome
change
in
the
grub
i
wonder
at
the
tolerant
silence
regarding
the
disappointing
christmas
dinner
the
men
impatiently
frown
down
the
occasional
kicker
the
warden
is
green
they
argue
he
did
not
know
that
we
are
supposed
to
get
currant
bread
for
the
holidays
he
will
do
better
jest
give
a
the
improvement
in
the
daily
meals
is
enlarged
upon
and
the
men
thrill
with
amazed
expectancy
at
the
incredible
report
oysters
for
new
dinner
with
gratification
we
hear
the
major
expression
of
disgust
at
the
filthy
condition
of
the
prison
his
condemnation
of
the
basket
cell
and
dungeon
as
barbarous
and
the
promise
of
radical
reforms
as
an
earnest
of
his
régime
he
has
released
from
solitary
the
men
whom
warden
wright
had
punished
for
having
served
as
witnesses
in
the
defence
of
murphy
and
mong
greedy
for
the
large
reward
hopkins
and
his
stools
had
accused
the
two
men
of
a
mysterious
murder
committed
in
elk
city
several
years
previously
the
criminal
trial
involving
the
suicide
of
an
officer
whom
the
warden
had
forced
to
testify
against
the
defendants
resulted
in
the
acquittal
of
the
prisoners
whereupon
captain
wright
ordered
the
for
the
defence
to
be
punished
officer
robert
hunter
who
committed
suicide
august
in
clarion
where
the
trial
took
place
he
left
a
written
confession
in
which
he
accused
warden
wright
of
forcing
him
to
testify
against
men
whom
he
knew
to
be
innocent
the
new
warden
himself
a
physician
introduces
hygienic
rules
abolishes
the
of
the
floor
because
of
the
detrimental
effect
of
the
dust
and
decides
to
separate
the
consumptive
and
syphilitic
prisoners
from
the
comparatively
healthy
ones
upon
examination
per
cent
of
the
population
are
discovered
in
various
stages
of
tuberculosis
and
per
cent
insane
the
death
rate
from
consumption
is
found
to
range
between
and
per
cent
at
light
tasks
in
the
block
and
the
yard
the
major
finds
employment
for
the
sickly
inmates
special
gangs
are
assigned
to
keeping
the
prison
clean
the
rest
of
the
men
at
work
in
the
shop
with
the
exception
of
a
number
of
dangerously
insane
who
are
to
be
committed
to
an
asylum
every
prisoner
in
the
institution
is
at
work
and
the
vexed
problem
of
idleness
resulting
from
the
labor
law
is
thus
solved
the
process
of
whitening
stone
floors
by
pulverizing
sand
into
their
surfaces
the
change
of
diet
better
hygiene
and
the
abolition
of
the
dungeon
produce
a
noticeable
improvement
in
the
life
of
the
prison
the
gloom
of
the
perceptibly
lifts
and
presently
the
men
are
surprised
at
music

between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
with
the
strains
of
merry
ragtime
by
the
newly
organized

at

session
he
is
the
oldest
man
in
the
prison
in
point
of
service
and
the
most
popular
lifer
his
innocence
of
murder
is
one
of
the
traditions
of
riverside
in
the
boat
he
had
rented
to
a
party
of
picnickers
a
woman
was
found
dead
no
clew
could
be
discovered
and
aleck
was
sentenced
to
life
because
he
could
not
be
forced
to
divulge
the
names
of
the
men
who
had
hired
his
boat
he
pauses
to
tell
me
the
sad
news
the
authorities
have
opposed
his
pardon
demanding
that
he
furnish
the
information
desired
by
them
he
looks
sere
with
confinement
his
eyes
full
of
a
mute
sadness
that
can
find
no
words
his
face
is
deeply
seamed
his
features
grave
almost
immobile
in
the
long
years
of
our
friendship
i
have
never
seen
aleck
laugh
once
or
twice
he
smiled
and
his
whole
being
seemed
radiant
with
rare
sweetness
he
speaks
abruptly
with
a
perceptible
effort
yes

is
saying
it
true

refused

was
called
the
laziest
man
in
the
prison
not
once
in
five
years
had
he
accomplished
his
task
but
the
new
warden
transferred

in
much
trouble
he
has
been
repeatedly
punished
for
shouldering
the
faults
of
others
and
now
the
inspectors
have
informed
him
that
he
is
to
lose
the
greater
part
of
his
commutation

he
has
grown
wan
with
worry
over
the
uncertainty

every
morning

the
young
negro
and
he

silently

violent
stamping

i
see
snakes
with
admiring
glances
the
young
prisoners
hang
upon
the
lips
of
the
old
criminal
whose
perseverance
in
shamming
finally
forced
the
former
warden
to
assign
snakes
a
special
room
in
the
hospital
where
his
propensities
would
become
dormant
to
suffer
again

the
following

and
next
dinner
with
much
animation
the
rumored
resignation

is
discussed
the

is
gradually
weeding
out
the

is
gossiped
a

to
secure
the
position
of

to

this
source
of
conversation
is
inexhaustible
every
detail
of

life
serving
for
endless
discussion
and
heated
debate
but
at
the
whimpered
warning
of
an
approaching

the
circle
breaks
up
each
man
pretending
to
be
busy
dusting
and
cleaning
officer
mitchell
passes
by
with
short
legs
wide
apart
he
stands
surveying

mumbling
you

when

again
do
you
dare
talk
so
loud
one
by
one
the
men
steal
back
into
the
cage
jokingly
teasing
each
other
upon
their
happy
escape
presently
several
rangemen
join
the
group
conversation
becomes
animated
voices
are
raised
in
dispute
but
anger
subsides
and
a
hush
falls
upon
the
men
as
blind
charley
gropes
his
way
along
the
wall
bill
nye
reaches
for
his
hand
and
leads
him
to
a
seat
on
the
barrel
feelin
better
charley
he
asks
gently
i
think
a
little
better
the
blind
man
says
in
an
uncertain
hesitating
manner
his
face
wears
a
bewildered
expression
as
if
he
has
not
yet
become
resigned
to
his
great
misfortune
it
happened
only
a
few
months
ago
in
company
with
two
friends
considerably
the
worse
for
liquor
he
was
passing
a
house
on
the
outskirts
of
allegheny
it
was
growing
dark
and
they
wanted
a
drink
charley
knocked
at
the
door
a
head
appeared
at
an
upper
window
robbers
some
one
suddenly
cried
there
was
a
flash
with
a
cry
of
pain
charley
caught
at
his
eyes
he
staggered
then
turned
round
and
round
helpless
in
a
daze
he
see
his
companions
the
house
and
the
street
disappeared
and
all
was
utter
darkness
the
ground
seemed
to
give
beneath
his
feet
and
charley
fell
down
upon
his
face
moaning
and
calling
to
his
friends
but
they
had
fled
in
terror
and
he
was
alone
in
the
darkness
alone
and
blind
i
glad
you
feel
better
charley
bill
nye
says
kindly
how
are
your
eyes
i
think
a
bit
better
the
gunshot
had
severed
the
optic
nerves
in
both
eyes
his
sight
is
destroyed
forever
but
with
the
incomplete
realization
of
sudden
calamity
charley
believes
his
eyesight
only
temporarily
injured
billy
he
says
presently
when
i
woke
this
morning
it
did
seem
so
dark
it
was
like
a
film
over
my
eyes
perhaps
it
may
get
better
yet
his
voice
quivers
with
the
expectancy
of
having
his
hope
confirmed
ah
whatcher
kiddin
yourself
for
snakes
interposes
shut
up
you
big
stiff
bill
flares
up
grabbing
snakes
by
the
throat
charley
he
adds
i
once
got
paralyzed
in
my
left
eye
it
looked
just
like
yours
now
and
i
felt
as
if
there
was
a
film
on
it
do
you
see
things
like
in
a
fog
charley
yes
yes
just
like
that
well
that
the
way
it
was
with
me
but
little
by
little
things
got
to
be
lighter
and
now
the
eye
is
as
good
as
ever
is
that
right
billy
charley
inquires
anxiously
what
did
you
do
well
the
doc
put
things
in
my
eye
the
croaker
here
is
giving
you
some
applications
ai
he
yes
but
he
says
it
for
the
inflammation
that
right
that
what
the
doctors
told
me
you
just
take
it
easy
charley
do
worry
you
come
out
all
right
see
if
you
do
bill
reddens
guiltily
at
the
unintended
expression
but
quickly
holds
up
a
warning
finger
to
silence
the
giggling
snowball
kid
then
with
sudden
vehemence
he
exclaims
by
god
charley
if
i
ever
meet
that
judge
of
yours
on
a
dark
night
i
choke
him
with
these
here
hands
so
help
me
it
a
damn
shame
to
send
you
here
in
this
condition
you
should
have
gone
to
a
hospital
that
what
i
say
but
cheer
up
old
boy
you
wo
have
to
serve
your
three
years
you
can
bet
on
that
we
all
club
together
to
get
your
case
up
for
a
pardon
wo
we
boys
with
unwonted
energy
the
old
yegg
makes
the
rounds
of
the
cage
taking
pledges
of
contributions
doctor
george
appears
around
the
corner
industriously
polishing
the
brasswork
and
bill
appeals
to
him
to
corroborate
his
diagnosis
of
the
blind
man
condition
a
smile
of
timid
joy
suffuses
the
sightless
face
as
bill
nye
slaps
him
on
the
shoulder
crying
jovially
what
did
i
tell
you
eh
you
be
soon
and
meantime
keep
your
mind
busy
how
to
avenge
the
injustice
done
you
and
with
a
violent
wink
in
the
direction
of
snakes
the
yegg
launches
upon
a
reminiscence
of
his
youth
as
far
as
he
can
remember
he
relates
the
spirit
of
vengeance
was
strong
within
him
he
has
always
religiously
revenged
any
wrong
he
was
made
to
suffer
but
the
incident
that
afforded
him
the
greatest
joy
was
an
experience
of
his
boyhood
he
was
fifteen
then
and
living
with
his
widowed
mother
and
three
elder
sisters
in
a
small
country
place
one
evening
as
the
family
gathered
in
the
large
his
sister
mary
said
something
which
deeply
offended
him
in
great
rage
he
left
the
house
just
as
he
was
crossing
the
street
he
was
met
by
a
tall
gentleman
evidently
a
stranger
in
the
town
the
man
guardedly
inquired
whether
the
boy
could
direct
him
to
some
address
where
one
might
pass
the
evening
pleasantly
quick
as
a
flash
a
brilliant
idea
struck
me
bill
narrates
warming
to
his
story
never
short
of
them
anyhow
he
remarks
parenthetically
but
here
was
my
revenge
mean
a
do
you
i
ask
the
fellow
yes
that
what
was
wanted
my
man
says
says
i
to
him
kind
of
suddenly
the
house
there
right
across
the
street
that
the
place
you
want
and
i
point
out
to
him
the
house
where
the
old
lady
and
my
three
sisters
are
all
sitting
around
the
table
expectant
like
waiting
for
me
you
know
well
the
man
gives
me
a
quarter
and
up
he
goes
knocks
on
the
door
and
steps
right
in
i
hide
in
a
dark
corner
to
see
what
coming
you
know
and
sure
enough
presently
the
door
opens
with
a
bang
and
something
comes
out
with
a
rush
and
falls
on
the
veranda
and
mother
she
got
a
broom
in
her
hand
and
the
girls
every
blessed
one
of
them
out
with
flatiron
and
dustpan
and
biff
baff
they
rain
it
upon
that
thing
on
the
steps
i
thought
i
split
my
sides
laughing
by
an
by
i
return
to
the
house
and
mother
and
sisters
are
kind
of
excited
and
i
says
up
girls
well
you
ought
to
hear
talk
did
they
beast
of
a
man
the
dirty
thing
that
came
to
the
house
and
insulted
us
with
they
could
even
mention
the
awful
things
he
said
and
mary
that
the
sis
i
got
mad
at
she
cries
billie
you
so
big
and
strong
i
wish
you
was
here
when
that
nasty
old
thing
came
up
the
boys
are
hilarious
over
the
story
and
doctor
george
motions
me
aside
to
talk
over
old
times
with
a
hearty
pressure
i
greet
my
friend
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
the
days
of
the
first
investigation
suspected
of
complicity
he
had
been
removed
to
the
shops
and
only
recently
returned
to
his
former
position
in
the
block
his
beautiful
thick
hair
has
grown
thin
and
gray
he
looks
aged
and
worn
with
sadness
i
notice
his
tone
of
bitterness
they
almost
killed
me
aleck
he
says
if
it
was
for
my
wife
i
murder
that
old
warden
throughout
his
long
confinement
his
wife
had
faithfully
stood
by
him
her
unfailing
courage
and
devotion
sustaining
him
in
the
hours
of
darkness
and
despair
the
dear
girl
he
muses
i
be
dead
if
it
was
for
her
but
his
release
is
approaching
he
has
almost
served
the
sentence
of
sixteen
years
for
alleged
complicity
in
the
bank
robbery
at
leechburg
during
which
the
cashier
was
killed
the
other
two
men
convicted
of
the
crime
have
both
died
in
prison
the
doctor
alone
has
survived
thanks
to
the
dear
girl
he
repeats
but
the
six
months
at
the
workhouse
fill
him
with
apprehension
he
has
been
informed
that
the
place
is
a
veritable
inferno
even
worse
than
the
penitentiary
however
his
wife
is
faithfully
at
work
trying
to
have
the
workhouse
sentence
suspended
and
full
liberty
may
be
at
hand
chapter
xliii
passing
the
love
of
woman
the
presence
of
my
old
friend
is
a
source
of
much
pleasure
george
is
an
intelligent
man
the
long
years
of
incarceration
have
not
circumscribed
his
intellectual
horizon
the
approach
of
release
is
intensifying
his
interest
in
the
life
beyond
the
gates
and
we
pass
the
idle
hours
conversing
over
subjects
of
mutual
interest
discussing
social
theories
and
problems
of
the
day
he
has
a
broad
grasp
of
affairs
but
his
temperament
and
catholic
traditions
are
antagonistic
to
the
ideas
dear
to
me
yet
his
attitude
is
free
from
personalities
and
narrow
prejudice
and
our
talks
are
conducted
along
scientific
and
philosophical
lines
the
recent
death
of
liebknecht
and
the
american
lecture
tour
of
peter
kropotkin
afford
opportunity
for
the
discussion
of
modern
social
questions
there
are
many
subjects
of
mutual
interest
and
my
friend
whose
was
among
the
signers
of
the
declaration
waxes
eloquent
in
denunciation
of
his
country
policy
of
extermination
in
the
philippines
and
the
growing
imperialistic
tendencies
of
the
republic
a
democrat
of
the
jeffersonian
type
he
is
virulent
against
the
old
warden
on
account
of
his
favoritism
and
discrimination
his
prison
experience
he
informs
me
has
considerably
altered
the
views
of
democracy
he
once
entertained
why
aleck
there
no
justice
he
says
vehemently
no
not
even
in
the
best
democracy
ten
years
ago
i
would
have
staked
my
life
on
the
courts
i
know
they
are
a
failure
our
whole
jurisprudence
is
wrong
you
see
i
have
been
here
nine
years
i
have
met
and
made
friends
with
hundreds
of
criminals
some
were
pretty
desperate
and
many
of
them
scoundrels
but
i
have
to
meet
one
yet
in
whom
i
could
discover
some
good
quality
if
he
scratched
right
look
at
that
fellow
there
he
points
to
a
young
prisoner
scrubbing
an
upper
range
that
the
hunk
he
in
for
murder
now
what
did
the
judge
and
jury
know
about
him
just
this
he
was
a
boy
in
the
mills
one
saturday
he
attended
a
wedding
with
a
chum
of
his
they
were
both
drunk
when
they
went
out
into
the
street
they
were
boisterous
and
a
policeman
tried
to
arrest
them
johnny
chum
resisted
the
cop
must
have
lost
his
head
he
shot
the
fellow
dead
it
was
right
near
johnny
home
and
he
ran
in
and
got
a
pistol
and
killed
the
policeman
must
have
been
crazy
with
drink
well
they
were
going
to
hang
him
but
he
was
only
a
kid
hardly
sixteen
they
gave
him
fifteen
years
now
he
all
in
they
just
ruined
the
boy
life
and
what
kind
of
a
boy
is
he
do
you
know
guess
what
he
did
it
was
only
a
few
months
ago
some
screw
told
him
that
the
widow
of
the
cop
he
shot
is
hard
up
she
has
three
children
and
takes
in
washing
do
you
know
what
johnny
did
he
went
around
among
the
cons
and
got
together
fifty
dollars
on
the
fancy
he
is
making
he
an
artist
at
it
he
sent
the
woman
the
money
and
begged
her
to
forgive
him
is
that
true
doctor
every
word
i
went
to
milligan
office
on
some
business
and
the
boy
had
just
sent
the
money
to
the
woman
the
chaplain
was
so
much
moved
by
it
he
told
me
the
whole
story
but
wait
that
is
all
you
know
what
that
woman
did
what
she
wrote
to
johnny
that
he
was
a
dirty
murderer
and
that
if
he
ever
goes
up
for
a
pardon
she
will
oppose
it
she
did
want
anything
to
do
with
him
she
wrote
but
she
kept
the
money
how
did
johnny
take
it
it
really
wonderful
about
human
nature
the
boy
cried
over
the
letter
and
told
the
chaplain
that
he
would
write
to
her
again
but
every
minute
he
can
spare
he
works
on
that
fancy
work
and
every
month
he
sends
her
money
that
the
the
judge
sentenced
to
fifteen
years
in
this
hell
my
friend
is
firmly
convinced
that
the
law
is
entirely
impotent
to
deal
with
our
social
ills
why
look
at
the
courts
he
exclaims
they
do
concern
themselves
with
crime
they
merely
punish
the
criminal
absolutely
indifferent
to
his
antecedents
and
environment
and
the
predisposing
causes
but
george
i
rejoin
it
is
the
economic
system
of
exploitation
the
dependence
upon
a
master
for
your
livelihood
want
and
the
fear
of
want
which
are
responsible
for
most
crimes
only
partly
so
aleck
if
it
was
for
the
corruption
in
our
public
life
and
the
commercial
scourge
that
holds
everything
for
sale
and
the
spirit
of
materialism
which
has
cheapened
human
life
there
would
not
be
so
much
violence
and
crime
even
under
what
you
call
the
capitalist
system
at
any
rate
there
is
no
doubt
the
law
is
an
absolute
failure
in
dealing
with
crime
the
criminal
belongs
to
the
sphere
of
therapeutics
give
him
to
the
doctor
instead
of
the
jailer
you
mean
george
that
the
criminal
is
to
be
considered
a
product
of
anthropological
and
physical
factors
but
do
you
see
that
you
must
also
examine
society
to
determine
to
what
extent
social
conditions
are
responsible
for
criminal
actions
and
if
that
were
done
i
believe
most
crimes
would
be
found
to
be
misdirected
energy
misdirected
because
of
false
standards
wrong
environment
and
unenlightened
well
i
have
given
much
thought
to
that
phase
of
the
question
but
aside
of
social
conditions
see
what
a
bitch
the
penal
institutions
are
making
of
it
for
one
thing
the
promiscuous
mingling
of
young
and
old
without
regard
to
relative
depravity
and
criminality
is
converting
prisons
into
veritable
schools
of
crime
and
vice
the
blackjack
and
the
dungeon
are
surely
not
the
proper
means
of
reclamation
no
matter
what
the
social
causes
of
crime
restraint
and
penal
methods
ca
reform
the
very
idea
of
punishment
precludes
betterment
true
reformation
can
emanate
only
from
voluntary
impulse
inspired
and
cultivated
by
intelligent
advice
and
kind
treatment
but
reformation
which
is
the
result
of
fear
lacks
the
very
essentials
of
its
object
and
will
vanish
like
smoke
the
moment
fear
abates
and
you
know
aleck
the
reformatories
are
even
worse
than
the
prisons
look
at
the
fellows
here
from
the
various
reform
schools
why
it
a
disgrace
the
boys
who
come
from
the
outside
are
decent
fellows
but
those
kids
from
the
reformatories
of
the
cons
here
have
graduated
there
they
are
terrible
you
can
spot
them
by
looking
at
them
they
are
worse
than
street
prostitutes
my
friend
is
very
bitter
against
the
prison
element
variously
known
as
the
girls
sallies
and
punks
who
for
gain
traffic
in
sexual
gratification
but
he
takes
a
broad
view
of
the
moral
aspect
of
homosexuality
his
denunciation
is
against
the
commerce
in
carnal
desires
as
a
medical
man
and
a
student
he
is
deeply
interested
in
the
manifestations
of
suppressed
sex
he
speaks
with
profound
sympathy
of
the
brilliant
english
whom
the
world
of
cant
and
stupidity
has
driven
to
prison
and
to
death
because
his
sex
life
did
not
conform
to
the
accepted
standards
in
detail
my
friend
traces
the
various
phases
of
his
psychic
development
since
his
imprisonment
and
i
warm
toward
him
with
a
sense
of
intense
humanity
as
he
reveals
the
intimate
emotions
of
his
being
a
general
medical
practitioner
he
had
not
come
in
personal
contact
with
cases
of
homosexuality
he
had
heard
of
pederasty
but
like
the
majority
of
his
colleagues
he
had
neither
understanding
for
nor
sympathy
with
the
sex
practices
he
considered
abnormal
and
vicious
in
prison
he
was
horrified
at
the
perversion
that
frequently
came
under
his
observation
for
two
years
the
very
thought
of
such
matters
filled
him
with
disgust
he
even
refused
to
speak
to
the
men
and
boys
known
to
be
homosexual
unconditionally
condemning
them
with
my
prejudices
rather
than
my
reason
he
remarks
but
the
forces
of
suppression
were
at
work
now
this
is
in
confidence
aleck
he
cautions
me
i
know
you
will
understand
probably
you
yourself
have
experienced
the
same
thing
i
glad
i
can
talk
to
some
one
about
it
the
other
fellows
here
would
understand
it
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
how
they
all
grow
indignant
over
a
fellow
who
is
caught
and
the
officers
too
though
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
quite
a
number
of
them
are
addicted
to
these
practices
well
i
tell
you
i
suppose
it
the
same
story
with
every
one
here
especially
the
i
was
terribly
dejected
and
hopeless
when
i
came
sixteen
years
i
believe
for
a
moment
i
could
live
through
it
i
was
abusing
myself
pretty
badly
still
after
a
while
when
i
got
work
and
began
to
take
an
interest
in
this
life
i
got
over
it
but
as
time
went
the
sex
instinct
awakened
i
was
young
about
strong
and
healthy
sometimes
i
thought
i
get
crazy
with
passion
you
remember
when
we
were
celling
together
on
that
upper
range
on
r
you
were
in
the
stocking
shop
then
were
you
do
you
remember
of
course
i
remember
george
you
were
in
the
cell
next
mine
we
could
see
out
on
the
river
it
was
in
the
summer
we
could
hear
the
excursion
boats
and
the
girls
singing
and
dancing
that
too
helped
to
turn
me
back
to
onanism
i
really
believe
the
whole
blessed
range
used
to
then
think
of
the
precious
material
fed
to
the
fishes
he
smiles
the
privies
you
know
empty
into
the
river
some
geniuses
may
have
been
lost
to
the
world
in
those
orgies
yes
orgies
that
just
what
they
were
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
there
is
a
single
man
in
the
prison
who
does
abuse
himself
at
one
time
or
another
if
there
is
he
a
mighty
exception
i
have
known
some
men
to
masturbate
four
and
five
times
a
day
kept
it
up
for
months
too
yes
and
they
either
get
the
con
or
go
bugs
as
a
medical
man
i
think
that
if
practised
no
more
frequently
than
ordinary
coition
would
be
no
more
injurious
than
the
latter
but
it
ca
be
done
it
grows
on
you
terribly
and
the
second
stage
is
more
dangerous
than
the
first
what
do
you
call
the
second
well
the
first
is
the
dejection
stage
hopeless
and
despondent
you
seek
forgetfulness
in
onanism
you
do
care
what
happens
it
what
i
might
call
mechanical
not
induced
by
actual
sex
desire
this
stage
passes
with
your
dejection
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
take
an
interest
in
the
new
life
as
all
of
us
are
forced
to
do
before
long
the
second
stage
is
the
psychic
and
mental
it
is
not
the
result
of
dejection
with
the
gradual
adaptation
to
the
new
conditions
a
comparatively
normal
life
begins
manifesting
sexual
desires
at
this
stage
your
is
induced
by
actual
need
it
is
the
more
dangerous
phase
because
the
frequency
of
the
practice
grows
with
the
recurring
thought
of
home
your
wife
or
sweetheart
while
the
first
was
mechanical
giving
no
special
pleasure
and
resulting
only
in
increasing
lassitude
the
second
stage
revolves
about
the
charms
of
some
loved
woman
or
one
desired
and
affords
intense
joy
therein
is
its
allurement
and
danger
and
that
why
the
habit
gains
in
strength
the
more
miserable
the
life
the
more
frequently
you
will
fall
back
upon
your
sole
source
of
pleasure
many
become
helpless
victims
i
have
noticed
that
prisoners
of
lower
intelligence
are
the
worst
in
this
respect
i
have
had
the
same
experience
the
narrower
your
mental
horizon
the
more
you
dwell
upon
your
personal
troubles
and
wrongs
that
is
probably
the
reason
why
the
more
illiterate
go
insane
with
confinement
no
doubt
of
it
you
have
had
exceptional
opportunities
for
observation
of
the
solitaries
and
the
new
men
what
did
you
notice
aleck
well
in
some
respects
the
existence
of
a
prisoner
is
like
the
life
of
a
factory
worker
as
a
rule
men
used
to
outdoor
life
suffer
most
from
solitary
they
are
less
able
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
close
quarters
and
the
foul
air
quickly
attacks
their
lungs
besides
those
who
have
no
interests
beyond
their
personal
life
soon
become
victims
of
insanity
i
always
advised
new
men
to
interest
themselves
in
some
study
or
fancy
work
it
their
only
salvation
if
you
yourself
have
survived
it
because
you
lived
in
your
theories
and
ideals
i
sure
of
it
and
i
continued
my
medical
studies
and
sought
to
absorb
myself
in
scientific
subjects
for
a
moment
george
pauses
the
veins
of
his
forehead
protrude
as
if
he
is
undergoing
a
severe
mental
struggle
presently
he
says
aleck
going
to
speak
very
frankly
to
you
i
much
interested
in
the
subject
i
give
you
my
intimate
experiences
and
i
want
you
to
be
just
as
frank
with
me
i
think
it
one
of
the
most
important
things
and
i
want
to
learn
all
i
can
about
it
very
little
is
known
about
it
and
much
less
understood
about
what
george
about
homosexuality
i
have
spoken
of
the
second
phase
of
onanism
with
a
strong
effort
i
overcame
it
not
entirely
of
course
but
i
have
succeeded
in
regulating
the
practice
indulging
in
it
at
certain
intervals
but
as
the
months
and
years
passed
my
emotions
manifested
themselves
it
was
like
a
psychic
awakening
the
desire
to
love
something
was
strong
upon
me
once
i
caught
a
little
mouse
in
my
cell
and
tamed
it
a
bit
it
would
eat
out
of
my
hand
and
come
around
at
meal
times
and
by
and
by
it
would
stay
all
evening
to
play
with
me
i
learned
to
love
it
honestly
aleck
i
cried
when
it
died
and
then
for
a
long
time
i
felt
as
if
there
was
a
void
in
my
heart
i
wanted
something
to
love
it
just
swept
me
with
a
wild
craving
for
affection
somehow
the
thought
of
woman
gradually
faded
from
my
mind
when
i
saw
my
wife
it
was
just
like
a
dear
friend
but
i
did
feel
toward
her
sexually
one
day
as
i
was
passing
in
the
hall
i
noticed
a
young
boy
he
had
been
in
only
a
short
time
and
he
was
with
a
smooth
little
face
and
sweet
lips
he
reminded
me
of
a
girl
i
used
to
court
before
i
married
after
that
i
frequently
surprised
myself
thinking
of
the
lad
i
felt
no
desire
toward
him
except
just
to
know
him
and
get
friendly
i
became
acquainted
with
him
and
when
he
heard
i
was
a
medical
man
he
would
often
call
to
consult
me
about
the
stomach
trouble
he
suffered
the
doctor
here
persisted
in
giving
the
poor
kid
salts
and
physics
all
the
time
well
aleck
i
could
hardly
believe
it
myself
but
i
grew
so
fond
of
the
boy
i
was
miserable
when
a
day
passed
without
my
seeing
him
i
would
take
big
chances
to
get
near
him
i
was
rangeman
then
and
he
was
assistant
on
a
top
tier
we
often
had
opportunities
to
talk
i
got
him
interested
in
literature
and
advised
him
what
to
read
for
he
did
know
what
to
do
with
his
time
he
had
a
fine
character
that
boy
and
he
was
bright
and
intelligent
at
first
it
was
only
a
liking
for
him
but
it
increased
all
the
time
till
i
could
think
of
any
woman
but
do
misunderstand
me
aleck
it
was
that
i
wanted
a
i
swear
to
you
the
other
youths
had
no
attraction
for
me
whatever
but
this
boy
his
name
was
floyd
he
became
so
dear
to
me
why
i
used
to
give
him
everything
i
could
get
i
had
a
friendly
guard
and
he
bring
me
fruit
and
things
sometimes
i
just
die
to
eat
it
but
i
always
gave
it
to
floyd
and
aleck
you
remember
when
i
was
down
in
the
dungeon
six
days
well
it
was
for
the
sake
of
that
boy
he
did
something
and
i
took
the
blame
on
myself
and
the
last
time
they
kept
me
nine
days
chained
up
i
hit
a
fellow
for
abusing
floyd
he
was
small
and
could
defend
himself
i
did
not
realize
it
at
the
time
aleck
but
i
know
now
that
i
was
simply
in
love
with
the
boy
wildly
madly
in
love
it
came
very
gradually
for
two
years
i
loved
him
without
the
least
taint
of
sex
desire
it
was
the
purest
affection
i
ever
felt
in
my
life
it
was
and
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
life
for
him
if
he
had
asked
it
but
by
degrees
the
psychic
stage
began
to
manifest
all
the
expressions
of
love
between
the
opposite
sexes
i
remember
the
first
time
he
kissed
me
it
was
early
in
the
morning
only
the
rangemen
were
out
and
i
stole
up
to
his
cell
to
give
him
a
delicacy
he
put
both
hands
between
the
bars
and
pressed
his
lips
to
mine
aleck
i
tell
you
never
in
my
life
had
i
experienced
such
bliss
as
at
that
moment
five
years
ago
but
it
thrills
me
every
time
i
think
of
it
it
came
suddenly
i
did
expect
it
it
was
entirely
spontaneous
our
eyes
met
and
it
seemed
as
if
something
drew
us
together
he
told
me
he
was
very
fond
of
me
from
then
on
we
became
lovers
i
used
to
neglect
my
work
and
risk
great
danger
to
get
a
chance
to
kiss
and
embrace
him
i
grew
terribly
jealous
too
though
i
had
no
cause
i
passed
through
every
phase
of
a
passionate
love
with
this
difference
though
i
felt
a
touch
of
the
old
disgust
at
the
thought
of
actual
sex
contact
that
i
do
it
seemed
to
me
a
desecration
of
the
boy
and
of
my
love
for
him
but
after
a
while
that
feeling
also
wore
off
and
i
desired
sexual
relation
with
him
he
said
he
loved
me
enough
to
do
even
that
for
me
though
he
had
never
done
it
before
he
had
been
in
any
reformatory
you
know
and
yet
somehow
i
could
bring
myself
to
do
it
i
loved
the
lad
too
much
for
it
perhaps
you
will
smile
aleck
but
it
was
real
true
love
when
floyd
was
unexpectedly
transferred
to
the
other
block
i
felt
that
i
would
be
the
happiest
man
if
i
could
only
touch
his
hand
again
or
get
one
more
kiss
you
you
laughing
he
asks
abruptly
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
his
voice
no
george
i
am
grateful
for
your
confidence
i
think
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
and
george
i
had
felt
the
same
horror
and
disgust
at
these
things
as
you
did
but
now
i
think
quite
differently
about
them
really
aleck
i
glad
you
say
so
often
i
was
troubled
is
it
viciousness
or
what
i
wondered
but
i
could
never
talk
to
any
one
about
it
they
take
everything
here
in
such
a
filthy
sense
yet
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
it
was
a
true
honest
emotion
george
i
think
it
a
very
beautiful
emotion
just
as
beautiful
as
love
for
a
woman
i
had
a
friend
here
his
name
was
russell
perhaps
you
remember
him
i
felt
no
physical
passion
toward
him
but
i
think
i
loved
him
with
all
my
heart
his
death
was
a
most
terrible
shock
to
me
it
almost
drove
me
insane
silently

on
the
ohio
my
dear
carolus
you
know
the
saying
der
eine
hat
den
beutel
der
andere
das
geld
i
find
it
a
difficult
problem
to
keep
in
touch
with
my
correspondents
i
have
the
leisure
but
theirs
is
the
advantage
of
the
paper
supply
thus
runs
the
world
but
you
a
most
faithful
correspondent
have
been
neglected
a
long
while
therefore
this
unexpected
chance
is
for
you
my
dear
boy
whatever
your
experiences
since
you
left
me
fashion
your
philosophy
in
the
image
of
disappointment
all
life
is
a
multiplied
pain
its
highest
expressions
love
and
friendship
are
sources
of
the
most
sorrow
that
has
been
my
experience
no
doubt
yours
also
and
you
are
aware
that
here
under
prison
conditions
the
disappointments
the
grief
and
anguish
are
so
much
more
acute
more
bitter
and
lasting
what
then
shall
one
seal
his
emotions
or
barricade
his
heart
ah
if
it
were
possible
it
would
be
wiser
some
claim
but
remember
dear
carl
mere
wisdom
is
a
barren
life
i
think
it
a
natural
reaction
against
your
prison
existence
that
you
feel
the
need
of
but
it
is
a
temporary
phase
i
hope
you
want
to
live
and
enjoy
you
say
but
surely
you
are
mistaken
to
believe
that
the
time
is
past
when
we
cheerfully
sacrificed
all
to
the
needs
of
the
cause
the
first
flush
of
emotional
enthusiasm
may
have
paled
but
in
its
place
there
is
the
deeper
and
more
lasting
conviction
that
permeates
one
whole
being
there
come
moments
when
one
asks
himself
the
justification
of
his
existence
the
meaning
of
his
life
no
torment
is
more
excruciating
and
overwhelming
than
the
failure
to
find
an
answer
you
will
discover
it
neither
in
physical
indulgence
nor
in
coldly
intellectual
pleasure
something
more
substantial
is
needed
in
this
regard
life
outside
does
not
differ
so
very
much
from
prison
existence
the
narrower
your
horizon
the
more
absorbed
you
are
in
your
immediate
environment
and
dependent
upon
it
the
sooner
you
decay
morally
and
mentally
you
can
in
a
measure
escape
the
sordidness
of
life
only
by
living
for
something
higher
perhaps
that
is
the
secret
of
my
survival
wider
interests
have
given
me
strength
and
other
phases
there
are
from
your
own
experience
you
know
what
sustaining
satisfaction
is
found
in
prison
in
the
constant
fight
for
the
feeling
of
human
dignity
because
of
the
constant
attempt
to
strangle
your
sense
of
i
have
seen
prisoners
offer
most
desperate
resistance
in
defence
of
their
manhood
on
my
part
it
has
been
a
continuous
struggle
do
you
remember
the
last
time
i
was
in
the
dungeon
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
comrade
kropotkin
presence
in
this
country
during
his
last
lecture
tour
the
old
warden
was
here
then
he
informed
me
that
i
would
not
be
permitted
to
see
our
grand
old
man
i
had
a
tilt
with
him
but
i
did
not
succeed
in
procuring
a
visiting
card
a
few
days
later
i
received
a
letter
from
peter
on
the
envelope
under
my
name
was
marked
political
prisoner
the
warden
was
furious
we
have
no
political
prisoners
in
a
free
country
he
thundered
tearing
up
the
envelope
but
you
have
political
grafters
i
retorted
we
argued
the
matter
heatedly
and
i
demanded
the
envelope
the
warden
insisted
that
i
apologize
of
course
i
refused
and
i
had
to
spend
three
days
in
the
dungeon
there
have
been
many
changes
since
then
your
coming
to
pittsburgh
last
year
and
the
threat
to
expose
this
place
they
knew
you
had
the
facts
helped
to
bring
matters
to
a
point
they
assigned
me
to
a
range
and
i
am
still
holding
the
position
the
new
warden
is
treating
me
more
decently
he
wants
no
trouble
with
me
he
told
me
but
he
has
proved
a
great
disappointment
he
started
in
with
promising
reforms
but
gradually
he
has
fallen
into
the
old
ways
in
some
respects
his
régime
is
even
worse
than
the
previous
one
he
has
introduced
a
system
of
economy
which
barely
affords
us
sufficient
food
the
dungeon
and
basket
which
he
had
at
first
abolished
are
in
operation
again
and
the
discipline
is
daily
becoming
more
drastic
the
result
is
more
brutality
and
clubbings
more
fights
and
cutting
affairs
and
general
discontent
the
new
management
can
not
plead
ignorance
for
the
last
of
july
the
men
gave
a
demonstration
of
the
effects
of
humane
treatment
the
warden
had
assembled
the
inmates
in
the
chapel
promising
to
let
them
pass
the
day
in
the
yard
on
condition
of
good
behavior
the
inspectors
and
the
old
guards
advised
against
it
arguing
the
great
risk
of
such
a
proceeding
but
the
major
decided
to
try
the
experiment
he
put
the
men
on
their
honor
and
turned
them
loose
in
the
yard
he
was
not
disappointed
the
day
passed
beautifully
without
the
least
mishap
there
was
not
even
a
single
report
we
began
to
breathe
easier
when
presently
the
whole
system
was
reversed
it
was
partly
due
to
the
influence
of
the
old
officers
upon
the
warden
and
the
latter
completely
lost
his
head
when
a
trusty
made
his
escape
from
the
hospital
it
seems
to
have
terrorized
the
warden
into
abandoning
all
reforms
he
has
also
been
censured
by
the
inspectors
because
of
the
reduced
profits
from
the
industries
now
the
tasks
have
been
increased
and
even
the
sick
and
consumptives
are
forced
to
work
the
labor
bodies
of
the
state
have
been
protesting
in
vain
how
miserably
weak
is
the
giant
of
toil
because
unconscious
of
his
strength
the
men
are
groaning
and
wishing
old
sandy
back
in
short
things
are
just
as
they
were
during
your
time
men
and
wardens
may
come
and
go
but
the
system
prevails
more
and
more
i
am
persuaded
of
the
great
truth
given
authority
and
the
opportunity
for
exploitation
the
results
will
be
essentially
the
same
no
matter
what
particular
set
of
men
or
of
principles
happens
to
be
in
the
saddle
fortunately
i
am
on
the
home
run
i
glad
you
felt
that
the
failure
of
my
application
to
the
superior
court
would
not
depress
me
i
built
no
castles
upon
it
yet
i
am
glad
it
has
been
tried
it
was
well
to
demonstrate
once
more
that
neither
lower
courts
pardon
boards
nor
higher
tribunals
are
interested
in
doing
justice
my
lawyers
had
such
a
strong
case
from
the
legal
standpoint
that
the
state
pardon
board
resorted
to
every
possible
trick
to
avoid
the
presentation
of
it
and
now
the
superior
court
thought
it
the
better
part
of
wisdom
to
ignore
the
argument
that
i
am
being
illegally
detained
they
simply
refused
the
application
with
a
few
meaningless
phrases
that
entirely
evade
the
question
at
issue
well
to
hell
with
them
i
have
an
a
stump
stump
months
and
i
feel
the
courage
of
perseverance
but
i
hope
that
the
next
legislature
will
not
repeal
the
new
commutation
law
there
is
considerable
talk
of
it
for
the
politicians
are
angry
that
their
efforts
in
behalf
of
the
wealthy
grafters
in
the
eastern
penitentiary
failed
they
begrudge
the
common
prisoner
the
increased
allowance
of
good
time
however
i
shall
make
it
of
course
you
understand
that
both
french
leave
and
dutch
act
are
out
of
the
question
now
i
have
decided
to
stay
till
i
can
through
the
gates
in
reference
to
french
leave
have
you
read
about
the
biddle
affair
i
think
it
was
the
most
remarkable
attempt
in
the
history
of
the
country
think
of
the
wife
of
the
jail
warden
helping
prisoners
to
escape
the
boys
here
were
simply
wild
with
joy
every
one
hoped
they
would
make
good
their
escape
and
old
sammy
told
me
he
prayed
they
should
be
caught
but
all
the
bloodhounds
of
the
law
were
unchained
the
biddle
boys
got
no
chance
at
all
the
story
is
this
the
brothers
biddle
jack
and
ed
and
walter
dorman
while
in
the
act
of
robbing
a
store
killed
a
man
it
was
dorman
who
fired
the
shot
but
he
turned
state
evidence
the
state
rewards
treachery
dorman
escaped
the
noose
but
the
two
brothers
were
sentenced
to
die
as
is
customary
they
were
visited
in
the
jail
by
the
gospel
ladies
among
them
the
wife
of
the
warden
you
probably
remember
him
soffel
he
was
deputy
warden
when
we
were
in
the
jail
and
a
rat
he
was
too
well
ed
was
a
man
with
soft
manners
and
so
forth
soffel
fell
in
love
with
him
it
was
mutual
i
believe
now
witness
the
heroism
a
woman
is
capable
of
when
she
loves
soffel
determined
to
save
the
two
brothers
i
understand
they
promised
her
to
quit
their
criminal
life
every
day
she
would
visit
the
condemned
men
to
console
them
pretending
to
read
the
gospel
she
would
stand
close
to
the
doors
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
saw
through
the
bars
she
supplied
them
with
revolvers
and
they
agreed
to
escape
together
of
course
she
could
not
go
back
to
her
husband
for
she
loved
ed
loved
him
well
enough
never
even
to
see
her
children
again
the
night
for
the
escape
was
set
the
brothers
intended
to
separate
immediately
after
the
break
subsequently
to
meet
together
with
soffel
but
the
latter
insisted
on
going
with
them
ed
begged
her
not
to
he
knew
that
it
was
sheer
suicide
for
all
of
them
but
she
persisted
and
ed
acquiesced
fully
realizing
that
it
would
prove
fatal
do
you
think
it
showed
a
noble
trait
in
the
boy
he
did
not
want
her
to
think
that
he
was
deserting
her
the
escape
from
the
jail
was
made
successfully
they
even
had
several
hours
start
but
snow
had
fallen
and
it
was
easy
to
trace
two
men
and
a
woman
in
a
sleigh
the
brutality
of
the
is
past
belief
when
the
detectives
came
upon
the
boys
they
fired
their
winchesters
into
the
two
brothers
even
when
the
wounded
were
stretched
on
the
ground
bleeding
and
helpless
a
detective
emptied
his
revolver
into
ed
killing
him
jack
died
later
and
soffel
was
placed
in
jail
you
can
imagine
the
savage
fury
of
the
respectable
mob
soffel
was
denounced
by
her
husband
and
all
the
good
christian
women
cried
unclean
and
clamored
for
the
punishment
of
their
unfortunate
sister
she
is
now
here
serving
two
years
for
aiding
in
the
escape
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
when
she
came
in
she
has
a
sympathetic
face
that
bears
signs
of
deep
suffering
she
must
have
gone
through
a
terrible
ordeal
think
of
the
struggle
before
she
decided
upon
the
desperate
step
then
the
days
and
weeks
of
anxiety
as
the
boys
were
sawing
the
bars
and
preparing
for
the
last
chance
i
should
appreciate
the
love
of
a
woman
whose
affection
is
stronger
than
the
iron
fetters
of
convention
in
some
ways
this
woman
reminds
me
of
the
girl
the
type
that
possesses
the
courage
and
strength
to
rise
above
all
considerations
for
the
sake
of
the
man
or
the
cause
held
dear
how
little
the
world
understands
the
vital
forces
of
life

the
bloom
of
the
barren
staff
i
it
is
september
the
nineteenth
the
is
silent
and
gray
in
the
afternoon
dusk
in
the
yard
the
rain
walks
with
long
strides
hastening
in
the
dim
twilight
hastening
whither
the
shadows
have
gone
i
stand
at
the
door
in
reverie
in
the
sombre
light
i
see
myself
led
through
the
gate
yonder
it
was
ten
years
ago
this
day
the
walls
towered
menacingly
in
the
dark
the
iron
gripped
my
heart
and
i
was
lost
in
despair
i
should
not
have
believed
then
that
i
could
survive
the
long
years
of
misery
and
pain
but
the
nimble
feet
of
the
rain
patter
hopefully
its
tears
dissipate
the
clouds
and
bring
light
and
soon
i
shall
step
into
the
sunshine
and
come
forth
grown
and
matured
as
the
world
must
have
grown
in
the
struggle
of
suffering
fresh
fish
a
rangeman
announces
pointing
to
the
long
line
of
striped
men
trudging
dejectedly
across
the
yard
and
stumbling
against
each
other
in
the
unaccustomed
lockstep
the
door
opens
and
aleck
killain
the
lifetimer
motions
to
me
he
walks
with
measured
even
step
along
the
hall
rangeman
coz
and
harry
my
young
assistant
stealthily
crowd
with
him
into
my
cell
the
air
of
mystery
about
them
arouses
my
apprehension
what
the
matter
boys
i
ask
they
hesitate
and
glance
at
each
other
smiling
diffidently
you
speak
killain
harry
whispers
the
lifetimer
carefully
unwraps
a
little
package
and
i
become
aware
of
the
sweet
scent
of
flowers
perfuming
the
cell
the
old
prisoner
stammers
in
confusion
as
he
presents
me
with
a
rose
big
and
red
we
swiped
it
in
the
greenhouse
he
says
fer
you
aleck
harry
adds
for
your
tenth
anniversary
corrects
coz
good
luck
to
you
aleck
mutely
they
grip
my
hand
and
steal
out
of
the
cell
in
solitude
i
muse
over
the
touching
remembrance
these
men
they
are
the
shame
society
hides
within
the
gray
walls
these
and
others
like
them
daily
they
come
to
be
buried
alive
in
this
grave
all
through
the
long
years
they
have
been
coming
and
the
end
is
not
yet
robbed
of
joy
and
life
their
being
is
discounted
in
the
economy
of
existence
and
all
the
while
the
world
has
been
advancing
it
is
said
science
and
philosophy
art
and
letters
have
made
great
strides
but
wherein
is
the
improvement
that
augments
misery
and
crowds
the
prisons
the
discovery
of
the
will
further
scientific
research
i
am
told
but
where
is
the
of
social
insight
that
will
discover
in
human
understanding
and
mutual
aid
the
elements
of
true
progress
deceptive
is
the
advance
that
involves
the
ruthless
sacrifice
of
peace
and
health
and
life
superficial
and
unstable
the
civilization
that
rests
upon
the
treacherous
sands
of
strife
and
warfare
the
progress
of
science
and
industry
far
from
promoting
man
happiness
and
social
harmony
merely
accentuates
discontent
and
sharpens
the
contrasts
the
knowledge
gained
at
so
much
cost
of
suffering
and
sacrifice
bears
bitter
fruit
for
lack
of
wisdom
to
apply
the
lessons
learned
there
are
no
limits
to
the
achievements
of
man
were
not
humanity
divided
against
itself
exhausting
its
best
energies
in
sanguinary
conflict
suicidal
and
unnecessary
and
these
the
thousands
stepmothered
by
cruel
stupidity
are
the
victims
castigated
by
society
for
her
own
folly
and
sins
there
is
young
harry
a
child
of
the
slums
he
has
never
known
the
touch
of
a
loving
hand
motherless
his
father
a
drunkard
the
heavy
arm
of
the
law
was
laid
upon
him
at
the
age
of
ten
from
reform
school
to
reformatory
the
social
orphan
has
been
driven
you
know
aleck
he
says
i
had
no
real
square
meal
to
feel
full
you
know
once
on
christmas
in
de
ref
at
the
age
of
nineteen
he
has
not
seen
a
day
of
liberty
since
early
childhood
three
years
ago
he
was
transferred
to
the
penitentiary
under
a
sentence
of
sixteen
years
for
an
attempted
escape
from
the
morganza
reform
school
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
keeper
the
latter
was
foreman
in
the
tailor
shop
in
which
harry
was
employed
together
with
a
number
of
other
youths
the
officer
had
induced
harry
to
do
overwork
above
the
regular
task
for
which
he
rewarded
the
boy
with
an
occasional
dainty
of
buttered
bread
or
a
piece
of
by
degrees
harry
voluntary
effort
became
part
of
his
routine
work
and
the
reward
in
delicacies
came
more
rarely
but
when
they
entirely
ceased
the
boy
rebelled
refusing
to
exert
himself
above
the
required
task
he
was
reported
but
the
superintendent
censured
the
keeper
for
the
unauthorized
increase
of
work
harry
was
elated
but
presently
began
systematic
persecution
that
made
the
boy
life
daily
more
unbearable
in
innumerable
ways
the
hostile
guard
sought
to
revenge
his
defeat
upon
the
lad
till
at
last
driven
to
desperation
harry
resolved
upon
escape
with
several
other
inmates
the
boy
planned
to
flee
to
the
rocky
mountains
there
to
hunt
the
wild
indians
and
live
the
independent
and
life
of
jesse
james
you
know
aleck
harry
confides
to
me
reminiscently
we
could
have
made
it
easy
dere
was
eleven
of
us
but
de
kids
was
all
sore
on
de
foreman
he
and
beat
us
an
some
of
de
boys
wouldn
go
we
knock
de
screw
out
first
it
was
me
pal
nacky
that
hit
foist
good
an
hard
an
den
i
hit
lightly
but
dey
all
said
in
court
that
i
hit
both
times
nacky
people
had
money
an
he
beat
de
case
but
i
got
soaked
sixteen
years
his
eyes
fill
with
tears
and
he
says
plaintively
i
have
been
outside
since
i
was
a
little
kid
an
now
i
sick
an
will
die
here
mebbe
ii
conversing
in
low
tones
we
sweep
the
range
i
shorten
my
strokes
to
enable
harry
to
keep
pace
weakly
he
drags
the
broom
across
the
floor
his
appearance
is
pitifully
grotesque
the
sickly
features
pale
with
the
color
of
the
prison
whitewash
resemble
a
little
child
but
the
eyes
look
oldish
in
their
wrinkled
sockets
the
head
painfully
out
of
proportion
with
the
puny
stunted
body
now
and
again
he
turns
his
gaze
on
me
and
in
his
face
there
is
melancholy
wonder
as
if
he
is
seeking
something
that
has
passed
him
by
often
i
ponder
is
there
a
crime
more
appalling
and
heinous
than
the
one
society
has
committed
upon
him
who
is
neither
man
nor
youth
and
never
was
child
crushed
by
the
heel
of
brutality
this
plant
had
never
budded
yet
there
is
the
making
of
a
true
man
in
him
his
mentality
is
pathetically
primitive
but
he
possesses
character
and
courage
and
latent
virgin
forces
his
emotional
frankness
borders
on
the
incredible
he
is
unmoral
and
unsocial
as
a
field
daisy
might
be
surrounded
by
giant
trees
yet
timidly
tenacious
of
its
own
being
it
distresses
me
to
witness
the
yearning
that
comes
into
his
eyes
at
the
mention
of
the
outside
often
he
asks
tell
me
aleck
how
does
it
feel
to
walk
on
de
street
to
know
that
you
free
t
go
where
you
damn
please
wid
no
screw
to
foller
you
ah
if
only
have
a
chance
he
reiterates
he
be
so
careful
not
to
get
into
trouble
he
would
like
to
keep
company
with
a
nice
girl
he
confides
blushingly
he
had
never
had
one
but
he
fears
his
days
are
numbered
his
lungs
are
getting
very
bad
and
now
that
his
father
has
died
he
has
no
one
to
help
him
get
a
pardon
perhaps
father
would
have
helped
him
either
he
was
always
drunk
and
never
cared
for
his
children
he
had
no
business
t
have
any
children
harry
comments
passionately
and
he
ca
expect
any
assistance
from
his
sister
the
poor
girl
barely
makes
a
living
in
the
factory
she
been
workin
so
long
in
the
pickle
works
harry
explains
that
feller
the
boss
there
must
be
rich
it
a
big
factory
he
adds
naïvely
he
oughter
give
enough
to
marry
on
but
he
fears
he
will
die
in
the
prison
there
is
no
one
to
aid
him
and
he
has
no
friends
i
never
had
no
friend
he
says
wistfully
there
ai
no
real
friends
de
older
boys
in
de
ref
always
used
me
an
dey
use
all
de
kids
but
dey
was
no
friends
an
every
one
was
against
me
in
de
court
an
dey
put
all
de
blame
on
me
everybody
was
always
against
me
he
repeats
bitterly
alone
in
the
cell
i
ponder
over
his
words
everybody
was
always
against
me
i
hear
the
boy
say
i
wake
at
night
with
the
quivering
cry
in
the
darkness
everybody
against
me
motherless
in
childhood
reared
in
the
fumes
of
brutal
inebriation
cast
into
the
slums
to
be
crushed
under
the
wheels
of
the
law
juggernaut
was
the
fate
of
this
social
orphan
is
this
the
fruit
of
progress
this
the
spirit
of
our
christian
civilization
in
the
hours
of
solitude
the
scheme
of
existence
unfolds
in
kaleidoscope
before
me
in
variegated
design
and
divergent
angle
it
presents
an
endless
panorama
of
stunted
minds
and
tortured
bodies
of
universal
misery
and
wretchedness
in
the
elemental
aspect
of
the
boy
desolate
life
and
i
behold
all
the
suffering
and
agony
resolve
themselves
in
the
dominance
of
the
established
in
tradition
and
custom
that
heavily
encrust
humanity
weighing
down
the
already
fettered
soul
till
its
wings
break
and
it
beats
helplessly
against
the
artificial
barriers
the
blanched
face
of
misery
is
silhouetted
against
the
night
the
silence
sobs
with
the
piteous
cry
of
the
crushed
boy
and
i
hear
the
cry
and
it
fills
my
whole
being
with
the
sense
of
terrible
wrong
and
injustice
with
the
shame
of
my
kind
that
sheds
crocodile
tears
while
it
swallows
its
helpless
prey
the
submerged
moan
in
the
dark
i
will
echo
their
agony
to
the
ears
of
the
world
i
have
suffered
with
them
i
have
looked
into
the
heart
of
pain
and
with
its
voice
and
anguish
i
will
speak
to
humanity
to
wake
it
from
sloth
and
apathy
and
lend
hope
to
despair
the
months
speed
in
preparation
for
the
great
work
i
must
equip
myself
for
the
mission
for
the
combat
with
the
world
that
struggles
so
desperately
to
defend
its
chains
the
day
of
my
resurrection
is
approaching
and
i
will
devote
my
new
life
to
the
service
of
my
the
world
shall
hear
the
tortured
it
shall
behold
the
shame
it
has
buried
within
these
walls
yet
not
eliminated
the
ghost
of
its
crimes
shall
rise
and
harrow
its
ears
till
the
social
conscience
is
roused
to
the
cry
of
its
victims
and
perhaps
with
eyes
once
opened
it
will
behold
the
misery
and
suffering
in
the
world
beyond
and
man
will
pause
in
his
strife
and
mad
race
to
ask
himself
wherefore
whither
chapter
xlvi
a
child
i
with
deep
gratification
i
observe
the
unfoldment
of
harry
mind
my
friendship
has
wakened
in
him
hope
and
interest
in
life
merely
to
please
me
he
smilingly
reiterated
he
would
apply
himself
to
reading
the
course
but
as
time
passed
he
became
absorbed
in
the
studies
developing
a
thirst
for
knowledge
that
is
transforming
his
primitive
intelligence
into
a
mentality
of
great
power
and
character
often
i
marvel
at
the
peculiar
strength
and
aspiration
springing
from
the
depths
of
a
prison
friendship
i
did
not
believe
in
friendship
aleck
harry
says
as
we
ply
our
brooms
in
the
day
work
but
now
i
feel
that
i
would
be
here
if
i
had
had
then
a
real
friend
it
only
that
we
suffer
together
but
you
have
made
me
feel
that
our
minds
can
rise
above
these
rules
and
bars
you
know
the
screws
have
warned
me
against
you
and
i
was
afraid
of
you
i
do
know
how
to
put
it
aleck
but
the
first
time
we
had
that
long
talk
last
year
i
felt
as
if
something
walked
right
over
from
you
to
me
and
since
then
i
have
had
something
to
live
for
you
know
i
have
seen
so
much
of
the
priests
i
have
no
use
for
the
church
and
i
do
believe
in
immortality
but
the
idea
i
got
from
you
clung
to
me
and
it
was
so
persistent
i
really
think
there
is
such
a
thing
as
immortality
of
an
idea
for
an
instant
the
old
look
of
helpless
wonder
is
in
his
face
as
if
he
is
at
a
loss
to
master
the
thought
he
pauses
in
his
work
his
eyes
fastened
on
mine
i
got
it
aleck
he
says
an
eager
smile
lighting
up
his
pallid
features
you
remember
the
story
you
told
me
about
them
fellers
oh
he
quickly
corrects
himself
when
i
get
excited
i
drop
into
my
former
bad
english
well
you
know
the
story
you
told
me
of
the
prisoners
in
siberia
how
they
escape
sometimes
and
the
peasants
though
forbidden
to
house
them
put
food
outside
of
their
huts
so
that
an
escaped
man
may
not
starve
to
death
you
remember
aleck
yes
harry
i
glad
you
have
forgotten
it
forgotten
why
aleck
a
few
weeks
ago
sitting
at
my
door
i
saw
a
sparrow
hopping
about
in
the
hall
it
looked
cold
and
hungry
i
threw
a
piece
of
bread
to
it
but
the
warden
came
by
and
made
me
pick
it
up
and
drive
the
bird
away
somehow
i
thought
of
the
peasants
in
siberia
and
how
they
share
their
food
with
escaped
men
why
should
the
bird
starve
as
long
as
i
have
bread
now
every
night
i
place
a
few
pieces
near
the
door
and
in
the
morning
just
when
it
begins
to
dawn
and
every
one
is
asleep
the
bird
steals
up
and
gets
her
breakfast
it
the
immortality
of
an
idea
aleck
ii
the
inclement
winter
has
laid
a
heavy
hand
upon
harry
the
foul
hot
air
of
the
is
aggravating
his
complaint
and
now
the
physician
has
pronounced
him
in
an
advanced
stage
of
consumption
the
disease
is
ravaging
the
population
hygienic
rules
are
ignored
and
no
precautions
are
taken
against
contagion
harry
health
is
fast
failing
he
walks
with
an
evident
effort
but
bravely
straightens
as
he
meets
my
gaze
i
feel
quite
strong
aleck
he
says
i
do
believe
it
the
con
just
a
bad
cold
he
clings
tenaciously
to
the
slender
hope
but
now
and
then
the
cunning
of
suspicion
tests
my
faith
pretending
to
wash
his
hands
he
asks
can
i
use
your
towel
aleck
sure
you
not
afraid
my
apparent
confidence
seems
to
allay
his
fears
and
he
visibly
rallies
with
renewed
hope
i
strive
to
lighten
his
work
on
the
range
and
his
friend
coz
who
attends
the
officers
table
shares
with
the
sick
boy
the
scraps
of
fruit
and
cake
left
after
their
meals
the
italian
serving
a
sentence
of
twenty
years
spends
his
leisure
weaving
hair
chains
in
the
dim
light
of
the
cell
and
invests
the
proceeds
in
warm
underwear
for
his
consumptive
friend
i
do
need
it
myself
i
too
anyhow
he
lightly
waves
aside
harry
objections
he
shudders
as
the
hollow
cough
shakes
the
feeble
frame
and
anxiously
hovers
over
the
boy
mothering
him
with
unobtrusive
tenderness
at
the
first
sign
of
spring
coz
conspires
with
me
to
procure
for
harry
the
privilege
of
the
yard
the
consumptives
are
deprived
of
air
immured
in
the
shop
or
block
and
in
the
evening
locked
in
the
cells
in
view
of
my
long
service
and
the
shortness
of
my
remaining
time
the
inspectors
have
promised
me
fifteen
minutes
exercise
in
the
yard
i
have
not
touched
the
soil
since
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
in
july
almost
four
years
ago
but
harry
is
in
greater
need
of
fresh
air
and
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
procure
the
privilege
for
him
instead
his
health
would
improve
and
in
the
meantime
we
will
bring
his
case
before
the
pardon
board
it
was
an
outrage
to
send
him
to
the
penitentiary
coz
asserts
vehemently
harry
was
barely
fourteen
then
a
mere
child
think
of
a
judge
who
will
give
such
a
kid
sixteen
years
why
it
means
death
but
what
can
you
expect
remember
the
little
boy
who
was
sent
here
it
was
somewhere
around
he
was
just
twelve
years
old
and
he
did
look
more
than
ten
they
brought
him
here
in
knickerbockers
and
the
fellows
had
to
bend
over
double
to
keep
in
lockstep
with
him
he
looked
just
like
a
baby
in
the
line
the
first
pair
of
long
pants
he
ever
put
on
was
stripes
and
he
was
so
frightened
he
stand
at
the
door
and
cry
all
the
time
well
they
got
ashamed
of
themselves
after
a
while
and
sent
him
away
to
some
reformatory
but
he
spent
about
six
months
here
then
oh
what
the
use
talking
coz
concludes
hopelessly
it
a
rotten
world
all
right
but
may
be
we
can
get
harry
a
pardon
honest
aleck
i
feel
as
if
he
my
own
child
been
friends
since
the
day
he
came
in
and
he
a
good
boy
only
he
never
had
a
chance
make
a
list
aleck
i
ask
the
chaplain
how
much
i
got
in
the
office
i
think
it
or
may
be
dollars
it
all
for
harry
the
spring
warms
into
summer
before
the
dime
and
quarter
donations
total
the
amount
required
by
the
attorney
to
carry
harry
case
to
the
pardon
board
but
the
sick
boy
is
missing
from
the
range
for
weeks
his
dry
hacking
cough
resounded
in
the
night
keeping
the
men
awake
till
at
last
the
doctor
ordered
him
transferred
to
the
hospital
his
place
on
the
range
has
been
taken
by
big
swede
a
tall
man
who
shuffles
along
the
hall
moaning
in
pain
the
passing
guards
mimic
him
and
poke
him
jocularly
in
the
ribs
hey
you
get
a
move
on
and
quit
your
shammin
he
starts
in
affright
pressing
both
hands
against
his
side
he
shrinks
at
the
officer
touch
you
fakir
we
next
to
all
right
an
uncomprehending
sickly
smile
spreads
over
the
sere
face
as
he
murmurs
plaintively
yis
sir
me
seek
very
seek
chapter
xlvii
chum
i
the
men
have
been
withdrawn
to
the
shops
and
only
the
old
and
decrepit
remain
in
the
but
even
the
light
duties
of
assistant
prove
too
difficult
for
the
swede
the
guards
insist
that
he
is
shamming
every
night
he
is
placed
in
a
and
gagged
to
stifle
his
groans
i
protest
against
the
mistreatment
and
am
cited
to
the
office
the
deputy
desk
is
occupied
by
bighead
the
officer
of
the
hosiery
department
now
promoted
to
the
position
of
second
assistant
deputy
he
greets
me
with
a
malicious
grin
i
knew
you
behave
he
chuckles
know
you
too
damn
well
from
the
stockin
shop
the
gigantic
colonel
the
new
deputy
and
broad
strolls
in
with
long
swinging
step
he
glances
over
the
report
against
me
is
that
all
he
inquires
of
the
guard
in
cold
impassive
voice
yes
sir
go
back
to
your
work
berkman
but
in
the
afternoon
officer
bighead
struts
into
the
in
charge
of
the
barber
gang
as
i
take
my
turn
in
the
first
chair
the
guard
hastens
toward
me
get
out
of
that
chair
he
commands
it
your
turn
you
take
chair
pointing
toward
the
second
barber
a
former
boilermaker
dreaded
by
the
men
as
a
butcher
it
my
turn
in
this
chair
i
reply
keeping
my
seat
dat
so
mr
officer
the
negro
barber
chimes
in
shut
up
the
officer
bellows
will
you
get
out
of
that
chair
he
advances
toward
me
threateningly
i
wo
i
retort
looking
him
squarely
in
the
eye
suppressed
giggling
passes
along
the
waiting
line
the
keeper
turns
purple
and
strides
toward
the
office
to
report
me
ii
this
is
awful
aleck
i
so
sorry
you
locked
up
you
were
in
the
right
too
coz
whispers
at
my
cell
but
never
min
old
boy
he
smiles
reassuringly
you
can
count
on
me
all
right
and
you
got
other
friends
here
a
stiff
some
one
sends
you
he
wants
an
answer
right
away
i
call
for
it
the
note
mystifies
me
the
large
bold
writing
is
unfamiliar
i
can
not
identify
the
signature
jim
the
contents
are
puzzling
his
sympathies
are
with
me
the
writer
says
he
has
learned
all
the
details
of
the
trouble
and
feels
that
i
acted
in
the
defence
of
my
rights
it
is
an
outrage
to
lock
me
up
for
resenting
undeserved
humiliation
at
the
hands
of
an
unfriendly
guard
and
he
can
not
bear
to
see
me
thus
persecuted
my
time
is
short
and
the
present
trouble
if
not
corrected
may
cause
the
loss
of
my
commutation
he
will
immediately
appeal
to
the
warden
to
do
me
justice
but
he
should
like
to
hear
from
me
before
taking
action
i
wonder
at
the
identity
of
the
writer
evidently
not
a
prisoner
intercession
with
the
warden
would
be
out
of
the
question
yet
i
can
not
account
for
any
officer
who
would
take
this
attitude
or
employ
such
means
of
communicating
with
me
presently
coz
saunters
past
the
cell
got
your
answer
ready
he
whispers
who
gave
you
the
note
coz
i
do
know
if
i
should
tell
you
of
course
you
must
tell
me
i
wo
answer
this
note
unless
i
know
to
whom
i
am
writing
well
aleck
he
hesitates
he
did
say
if
i
may
tell
you
then
better
go
and
ask
him
first
considerable
time
elapses
before
coz
returns
from
the
delay
i
judge
that
the
man
is
in
a
distant
part
of
the
institution
or
not
easily
accessible
at
last
the
kindly
face
of
the
italian
appears
at
the
cell
it
all
right
aleck
he
says
who
is
he
i
ask
impatiently
i
bet
you
never
guess
tell
me
then
well
i
tell
you
he
is
not
a
screw
ca
be
a
prisoner
no
who
then
he
is
a
fine
fellow
aleck
come
now
tell
me
he
is
a
citizen
the
foreman
of
the
new
shop
the
weaving
department
that
the
man
here
another
stiff
from
him
answer
at
once
iii
dear
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
to
you
it
is
the
most
remarkable
thing
that
has
happened
to
me
in
all
the
years
of
my
confinement
to
think
that
you
a
perfect
stranger
and
not
a
prisoner
at
that
should
offer
to
intercede
in
my
behalf
because
you
feel
that
an
injustice
has
been
done
it
is
almost
incredible
but
coz
has
informed
me
that
you
are
determined
to
see
the
warden
in
this
matter
i
assure
you
i
appreciate
your
sense
of
justice
more
than
i
can
express
it
but
i
most
urgently
request
you
not
to
carry
out
your
plan
with
the
best
of
intentions
your
intercession
will
prove
disastrous
to
yourself
as
well
as
to
me
a
shop
foreman
you
are
not
supposed
to
know
what
is
happening
in
the
block
the
warden
is
a
martinet
and
extremely
vain
of
his
authority
he
will
resent
your
interference
i
do
know
who
you
are
but
your
indignation
at
what
you
believe
an
injustice
characterizes
you
as
a
man
of
principle
and
you
are
evidently
inclined
to
be
friendly
toward
me
i
should
be
very
unhappy
to
be
the
cause
of
your
discharge
you
need
your
job
or
you
would
not
be
here
i
am
very
very
thankful
to
you
but
i
urge
you
most
earnestly
to
drop
the
matter
i
must
fight
my
own
battles
moreover
the
situation
is
not
very
serious
and
i
shall
come
out
all
right
with
much
appreciation
a
dear
i
feel
much
relieved
by
your
promise
to
accede
to
my
request
it
is
best
so
you
need
not
worry
about
me
i
expect
to
receive
a
hearing
before
the
deputy
and
he
seems
a
decent
chap
you
will
pardon
me
when
i
confess
that
i
smiled
at
your
question
whether
your
correspondence
is
welcome
your
notes
are
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
darkness
and
i
am
intensely
interested
in
the
personality
of
a
man
whose
sense
of
justice
transcends
considerations
of
personal
interest
you
know
no
great
heroism
is
required
to
demand
justice
for
oneself
in
the
furtherance
of
our
own
advantage
but
where
the
other
fellow
is
concerned
especially
a
stranger
it
becomes
a
question
of
abstract
justice
and
but
few
people
possess
the
manhood
to
jeopardize
their
reputation
or
comfort
for
that
since
our
correspondence
began
i
have
had
occasion
to
speak
to
some
of
the
men
in
your
charge
i
want
to
thank
you
in
their
name
for
your
considerate
and
humane
treatment
of
them
coz
is
at
the
door
and
i
must
hurry
trust
no
one
with
notes
except
him
we
have
been
friends
for
years
and
he
can
tell
you
all
you
wish
to
know
about
my
life
here
cordially
b
my
dear
there
is
no
need
whatever
for
your
anxiety
regarding
the
effects
of
the
solitary
upon
me
i
do
not
think
they
will
keep
me
in
long
at
any
rate
remember
that
i
do
not
wish
you
to
intercede
you
will
be
pleased
to
know
that
my
friend
harry
shows
signs
of
improvement
thanks
to
your
generosity
coz
has
managed
to
deliver
to
him
the
and
wine
you
sent
you
know
the
story
of
the
boy
he
has
never
known
the
love
of
a
mother
nor
the
care
of
a
father
a
typical
child
of
the
disinherited
he
was
thrown
almost
in
infancy
upon
the
tender
mercies
of
the
world
at
the
age
of
ten
the
law
declared
him
a
criminal
he
has
never
since
seen
a
day
of
liberty
at
twenty
he
is
dying
of
prison
consumption
was
the
spanish
inquisition
ever
guilty
of
such
organized
child
murder
with
desperate
he
clutches
at
life
in
the
hope
of
a
pardon
he
is
firmly
convinced
that
fresh
air
would
cure
him
but
the
new
rules
confine
him
to
the
hospital
his
friends
here
have
collected
a
fund
to
bring
his
case
before
the
pardon
board
it
is
to
be
heard
next
month
that
devoted
soul
coz
has
induced
the
doctor
to
issue
a
certificate
of
harry
critical
condition
and
he
may
be
released
soon
i
have
grown
very
fond
of
the
boy
so
much
sinned
against
i
have
watched
his
heart
and
mind
blossom
in
the
sunshine
of
a
little
kindness
and
now
i
hope
that
at
least
his
last
wish
will
be
gratified
just
once
to
walk
on
the
street
and
not
hear
the
harsh
command
of
the
guard
he
begs
me
to
express
to
his
unknown
friend
his
deepest
gratitude
dear
the
deputy
has
just
released
me
i
am
happy
with
a
double
happiness
for
i
know
how
pleased
you
will
be
at
the
good
turn
of
affairs
it
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
my
neighbor
the
big
swede
you
heard
about
him
was
found
dead
in
the
this
morning
the
doctor
and
officers
all
along
pretended
that
he
was
shamming
it
was
a
most
cruel
murder
by
the
warden
order
the
sick
swede
was
kept
gagged
and
bound
every
night
i
understand
that
the
deputy
opposed
such
brutal
methods
and
now
it
is
rumored
that
he
intends
to
resign
but
i
hope
he
will
remain
there
is
something
big
and
about
the
gigantic
colonel
he
tries
to
be
fair
and
he
has
saved
many
a
prisoner
from
the
cruelty
of
the
major
the
latter
is
continually
inventing
new
modes
of
punishment
it
is
characteristic
that
his
methods
involve
curtailment
of
rations
and
consequent
saving
which
is
not
accounted
for
on
the
books
he
has
recently
cut
the
milk
allowance
of
the
hospital
patients
notwithstanding
the
protests
of
the
doctor
he
has
also
introduced
severe
punishment
for
talking
you
know
when
you
have
not
uttered
a
word
for
days
and
weeks
you
are
often
seized
with
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
give
vent
to
your
feelings
these
infractions
of
the
rules
are
now
punished
by
depriving
you
of
tobacco
and
of
your
sunday
dinner
every
sunday
from
to
men
are
locked
up
on
the
top
range
to
remain
without
food
all
day
the
system
is
called
killicure
kill
or
cure
and
it
involves
considerable
graft
for
i
know
numbers
of
men
who
have
not
received
tobacco
or
a
sunday
dinner
for
months
warden
wm
johnston
seems
innately
cruel
recently
he
introduced
the
blind
cell
door
covered
with
solid
sheet
iron
it
is
much
worse
than
the
basket
cell
for
it
virtually
admits
no
air
and
men
are
kept
in
it
from
to
days
prisoner
varnell
was
locked
up
in
such
a
cell
days
becoming
paralyzed
but
even
worse
than
these
punishments
is
the
more
refined
brutality
of
torturing
the
boys
with
the
uncertainty
of
release
and
the
increasing
deprivation
of
good
time
this
system
is
developing
insanity
to
an
alarming
extent
amid
all
this
heartlessness
and
cruelty
the
chaplain
is
a
refreshing
oasis
of
humanity
i
noticed
in
one
of
your
letters
the
expression
because
of
economic
necessity
and
i
wondered
to
be
sure
the
effects
of
economic
causes
are
not
to
be
underestimated
but
the
extremists
of
the
materialistic
conception
discount
character
and
thus
help
to
vitiate
it
the
factor
of
personality
is
too
often
ignored
by
them
take
the
chaplain
for
instance
in
spite
of
the
surrounding
swamp
of
cupidity
and
brutality
notwithstanding
all
disappointment
and
ingratitude
he
is
after
years
of
incumbency
as
full
of
faith
in
human
nature
and
as
sympathetic
and
helpful
as
years
ago
he
has
had
to
contend
against
the
various
administrations
and
he
is
a
poor
man
necessity
has
not
stifled
his
innate
kindness
and
this
is
why
i
wondered
economic
necessity
has
socialism
pierced
the
prison
walls
dear
dear
comrade
can
you
realize
how
your
words
i
am
socialistically
inclined
warmed
my
heart
i
wish
i
could
express
to
you
all
the
intensity
of
what
i
feel
my
dear
and
to
have
so
unexpectedly
found
both
in
you
unutterably
lightens
this
miserable
existence
what
matter
that
you
do
not
entirely
share
my
views
we
are
comrades
in
the
common
cause
of
human
emancipation
it
was
indeed
well
worth
while
getting
in
trouble
to
have
found
you
dear
friend
surely
i
have
good
cause
to
be
content
even
happy
your
friendship
is
a
source
of
great
strength
and
i
feel
equal
to
struggling
through
the
ten
months
encouraged
and
inspired
by
your
comradeship
and
devotion
every
evening
i
cross
the
date
off
my
calendar
joyous
with
the
thought
that
i
am
a
day
nearer
to
the
precious
moment
when
i
shall
turn
my
back
upon
these
walls
to
join
my
friends
in
the
great
work
and
to
meet
you
dear
chum
face
to
face
to
grip
your
hand
and
salute
you
my
friend
and
comrade

fraternally

last
days
on
the
homestretch
april
my
dear
girl
the
last
spring
is
here
and
a
song
is
in
my
heart
only
three
more
months
and
i
shall
have
settled
accounts
with
father
penn
there
is
the
year
in
the
workhouse
of
course
and
that
prison
i
am
told
is
even
a
worse
hell
than
this
one
but
i
feel
strong
with
the
suffering
that
is
past
and
perhaps
even
more
so
with
the
wonderful
jewel
i
have
found
the
man
i
mentioned
in
former
letters
has
proved
a
most
beautiful
soul
and
sincere
friend
in
every
possible
way
he
has
been
trying
to
make
my
existence
more
endurable
with
what
little
he
may
he
says
he
wants
to
make
amends
for
the
injustice
and
brutality
of
society
he
is
a
socialist
with
a
broad
outlook
upon
life
our
lengthy
discussions
per
notes
afford
me
many
moments
of
pleasure
and
joy
it
is
chiefly
to
his
exertions
that
i
shall
owe
my
commutation
time
the
sentiment
of
the
inspectors
was
not
favorable
i
believe
it
was
intended
to
deprive
me
of
two
years
good
time
think
what
it
would
mean
to
us
but
my
friend
my
dear
chum
as
i
affectionately
call
him
has
quietly
but
persistently
been
at
work
with
the
result
that
the
inspectors
have
seen
the
light
it
is
now
definite
that
i
shall
be
released
in
july
the
date
is
still
uncertain
i
can
barely
realize
that
i
am
soon
to
leave
this
place
the
anxiety
and
restlessness
of
the
last
month
would
be
almost
unbearable
but
for
the
soothing
presence
of
my
devoted
friend
i
hope
some
day
you
will
meet
him
perhaps
even
soon
for
he
is
not
of
the
quality
that
can
long
remain
a
helpless
witness
of
the
torture
of
men
he
wants
to
work
in
the
broader
field
where
he
may
join
hands
with
those
who
strive
to
reconstruct
the
conditions
that
are
bulwarked
with
prison
bars
but
while
necessity
forces
him
to
remain
here
his
character
is
in
evidence
he
devotes
his
time
and
means
to
lightening
the
burden
of
the
prisoners
his
generous
interest
kept
my
sick
friend
harry
alive
in
the
hope
of
a
pardon
you
will
be
saddened
to
hear
that
the
board
refused
to
release
him
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
sufficiently
the
poor
boy
who
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
a
guard
since
he
was
a
child
of
ten
died
a
week
after
the
pardon
was
refused
but
though
my
chum
could
not
give
freedom
to
harry
he
was
instrumental
in
saving
another
young
life
from
the
hands
of
the
hangman
it
was
the
case
of
young
paul
typical
of
prison
as
the
nursery
of
crime
the
youth
was
forced
to
work
alongside
of
a
man
who
persecuted
and
abused
him
because
he
resented
improper
advances
repeatedly
paul
begged
the
warden
to
transfer
him
to
another
department
but
his
appeals
were
ignored
the
two
prisoners
worked
in
the
bakery
early
one
morning
left
alone
the
man
attempted
to
violate
the
boy
in
the
struggle
that
followed
the
former
was
killed
the
prison
management
was
determined
to
hang
the
lad
in
the
interests
of
discipline
the
officers
openly
avowed
they
would
fix
his
clock
permission
for
a
collection
to
engage
an
attorney
for
paul
was
refused
prisoners
who
spoke
in
his
behalf
were
severely
punished
the
boy
was
completely
isolated
preparatory
to
his
trial
he
stood
absolutely
helpless
alone
but
the
dear
chum
came
to
the
rescue
of
paul
the
work
had
to
be
done
secretly
and
it
was
a
most
difficult
task
to
secure
witnesses
for
the
defence
among
the
prisoners
terrorized
by
the
guards
but
chum
threw
himself
into
the
work
with
heart
and
soul
day
and
night
he
labored
to
give
the
boy
a
chance
for
his
life
he
almost
broke
down
before
the
ordeal
was
over
but
the
boy
was
saved
the
jury
acquitted
him
on
the
ground
of
the
proximity
of
release
if
only
to
change
cells
is
in
the
extreme
but
even
the
mere
change
will
be
a
relief
meanwhile
my
faithful
friend
does
everything
in
his
power
to
help
me
bear
the
strain
besides
ministering
to
my
physical
comforts
he
generously
supplies
me
with
books
and
publications
it
helps
to
while
away
the
days
and
keeps
me
abreast
of
the
world
work
the
chum
is
enthusiastic
over
the
growing
strength
of
socialism
and
we
often
discuss
the
subject
with
much
vigor
it
appears
to
me
however
that
the
socialist
anxiety
for
success
is
by
degrees
perverting
essential
principles
it
is
with
much
sorrow
i
have
learned
that
political
activity
formerly
viewed
merely
as
a
means
of
spreading
socialist
ideas
has
gradually
become
an
end
in
itself
straining
for
political
power
weakens
the
fibres
of
character
and
ideals
daily
contact
with
authority
has
strengthened
my
conviction
that
control
of
the
governmental
power
is
an
illusory
remedy
for
social
evils
inevitable
consequences
of
false
conceptions
are
not
to
be
legislated
out
of
existence
it
is
not
merely
the
conditions
but
the
fundamental
ideas
of
present
civilization
that
are
to
be
transvalued
to
give
place
to
new
social
and
individual
relations
the
emancipation
of
labor
is
the
necessary
first
step
along
the
road
of
a
regenerated
humanity
but
even
that
can
be
accomplished
only
through
the
awakened
consciousness
of
the
toilers
acting
on
their
own
initiative
and
strength
on
these
and
other
points
chum
differs
with
me
but
his
intense
friendship
knows
no
intellectual
distinctions
he
is
to
visit
you
during
his
august
vacation
i
know
you
will
make
him
feel
my
gratitude
for
i
can
never
repay
his
boundless
devotion
sasha
dearest
chum
it
seemed
as
if
all
aspiration
and
hope
suddenly
went
out
of
my
life
when
you
disappeared
so
mysteriously
i
was
tormented
by
the
fear
of
some
disaster
your
return
has
filled
me
with
joy
and
i
am
happy
to
know
that
you
heard
and
responded
unhesitatingly
to
the
call
of
a
sacred
cause
i
greatly
envy
your
activity
in
the
circle
the
revolution
in
russia
has
stirred
me
to
the
very
depths
the
giant
is
awakening
the
mute
giant
that
has
suffered
so
patiently
voicing
his
misery
and
agony
only
in
the
song
and
on
the
pages
of
his
gorkys
dear
friend
you
remember
our
discussion
regarding
plehve
i
may
have
been
in
error
when
i
expressed
the
view
that
the
execution
of
the
monster
encouraging
sign
of
individual
revolutionary
activity
as
it
was
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
manifestation
of
social
awakening
but
the
present
uprising
undoubtedly
points
to
widespread
rebellion
permeating
russian
life
yet
it
would
probably
be
too
optimistic
to
hope
for
a
very
radical
change
i
have
been
absent
from
my
native
land
for
many
years
but
in
my
youth
i
was
close
to
the
life
and
thought
of
the
peasant
large
heavy
bodies
move
slowly
the
proletariat
of
the
cities
has
surely
become
impregnated
with
revolutionary
ideas
but
the
vital
element
of
russia
is
the
agrarian
population
i
fear
moreover
that
the
dominant
reaction
is
still
very
strong
though
it
has
no
doubt
been
somewhat
weakened
by
the
discontent
manifesting
in
the
army
and
especially
in
the
navy
with
all
my
heart
i
hope
that
the
revolution
will
be
successful
perhaps
a
constitution
is
the
most
we
can
expect
but
whatever
the
result
the
bare
fact
of
a
revolution
in
russia
is
a
tremendous
inspiration
i
should
be
the
happiest
of
men
to
join
in
the
glorious
struggle
long
live
the
revolution
dear
chum
thanks
for
your
kind
offer
but
i
am
absolutely
opposed
to
having
any
steps
taken
to
eliminate
the
workhouse
sentence
i
have
served
these
many
years
and
i
shall
survive
one
more
i
will
ask
no
favors
of
the
enemy
they
will
even
twist
their
own
law
to
deprive
me
of
the
five
months
good
time
to
which
i
am
entitled
on
the
last
year
i
understand
that
i
shall
be
allowed
only
two
months
off
on
the
preposterous
ground
that
the
workhouse
term
constitutes
the
first
year
of
a
sentence
but
i
do
not
wish
you
to
trouble
about
the
matter
you
have
more
important
work
to
do
give
all
your
energies
to
the
good
cause
prepare
the
field
for
the
mission
of
tchaikovsky
and
babushka
and
i
shall
be
with
you
in
spirit
when
you
embrace
our
brave
comrades
of
the
russian
revolution
whose
dear
names
were
a
hallowed
treasure
of
my
youth
may
success
reward
the
efforts
of
our
brothers
in
russia
a
chum
just
got
word
from
the
deputy
that
my
papers
are
signed
i
did
wish
to
cause
you
anxiety
but
i
was
apprehensive
of
some
hitch
but
it
positive
and
settled
now
i
go
out
on
the
just
one
more
week
this
is
the
happiest
day
in
thirteen
years
shake
comrade
dearest
chum
my
hand
trembles
as
i
write
this
last
i
be
gone
in
an
hour
my
heart
is
too
full
for
words
please
send
enclosed
notes
to
my
friends
and
embrace
them
all
as
i
embrace
you
now
i
shall
live
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you
all
next
year
dear
devoted
friend
with
my
whole
heart
your
comrade
and
chum
july
dearest
girl
it
wednesday
morning
the
at
last
geh
stiller
meines
herzens
schlag
und
schliesst
euch
alle
meine
alten
wunden
denn
dieses
ist
mein
letzter
tag
und
dies
sind
seine
letzten
stunden
my
last
thoughts
within
these
walls
are
of
you
my
dear
dear
sonya
the
immutable
sasha
part
iii
the
workhouse
the
workhouse
i
the
gates
of
the
penitentiary
open
to
leave
me
out
and
i
pause
involuntarily
at
the
fascinating
sight
it
is
a
street
a
line
of
houses
stretches
before
me
a
woman
young
and
wonderfully
is
passing
on
the
opposite
side
my
eyes
follow
her
graceful
lines
as
she
turns
the
corner
men
stand
about
they
wear
citizen
clothes
and
scan
me
with
curious
insistent
gaze
the
handcuff
grows
taut
on
my
wrist
and
i
follow
the
sheriff
into
the
waiting
carriage
a
little
child
runs
by
i
lean
out
of
the
window
to
look
at
the
strangely
youthful
face
but
the
guard
impatiently
lowers
the
blind
and
we
sit
in
gloomy
silence
the
spell
of
the
civilian
garb
is
upon
me
it
gives
an
exhilarating
sense
of
manhood
again
and
again
i
glance
at
my
clothes
and
verify
the
numerous
pockets
to
reassure
myself
of
the
reality
of
the
situation
i
am
free
past
the
dismal
gray
walls
free
yet
even
now
captive
of
the
law
the
law
the
engine
puffs
and
shrieks
and
my
mind
speeds
back
to
another
journey
it
was
thirteen
years
and
one
week
ago
this
day
on
the
wings
of
an
love
i
hastened
to
join
the
struggle
of
the
oppressed
people
i
left
home
and
friends
sacrificed
liberty
and
risked
life
but
human
justice
is
blind
it
will
not
see
the
soul
on
fire
only
the
shot
was
heard
by
the
law
that
is
deaf
to
the
agony
of
toil
vengeance
is
mine
it
saith
to
the
uttermost
drop
it
will
shed
the
blood
to
exact
its
full
pound
of
flesh
twelve
years
and
ten
months
and
still
another
year
what
horrors
await
me
at
the
new
prison
poor
faithful
horsethief
will
nevermore
smile
his
greeting
he
did
not
survive
six
months
in
the
terrible
workhouse
but
my
spirit
is
strong
i
shall
not
be
daunted
this
garb
is
the
visible
tangible
token
of
resurrection
the
devotion
of
staunch
friends
will
solace
and
cheer
me
the
call
of
the
great
cause
will
give
strength
to
live
to
struggle
to
conquer
ii
humiliation
overwhelms
me
as
i
don
the
loathed
suit
of
striped
black
and
gray
the
insolent
look
of
the
guard
rouses
my
bitter
resentment
as
he
closely
scrutinizes
my
naked
body
but
presently
the
examination
over
a
sense
of
gratification
steals
over
me
at
the
assertiveness
of
my
the
ordeal
of
the
day
routine
is
full
of
inexpressible
anguish
accustomed
to
prison
conditions
i
yet
find
existence
in
the
workhouse
a
nightmare
of
cruelty
infinitely
worse
than
the
most
inhuman
aspects
of
the
penitentiary
the
guards
are
surly
and
brutal
the
food
foul
and
inadequate
punishment
for
the
slightest
offence
instantaneous
and
ruthless
the
cells
are
even
smaller
than
in
the
penitentiary
and
contain
neither
chair
nor
table
they
are
unspeakably
with
the
privy
buckets
for
the
purposes
of
which
no
scrap
of
waste
paper
is
allowed
the
sole
ablutions
of
the
day
are
performed
in
the
morning
when
the
men
form
in
the
hall
and
march
past
the
spigot
of
running
water
snatching
a
handful
in
the
constantly
moving
line
absolute
silence
prevails
in
and
shop
the
slightest
motion
of
the
lips
is
punished
with
the
blackjack
or
the
dungeon
referred
to
with
caustic
satire
as
the
white
house
the
perverse
logic
of
the
law
that
visits
the
utmost
limit
of
barbarity
upon
men
admittedly
guilty
of
minor
transgressions
throughout
the
breadth
of
the
land
the
workhouses
are
notoriously
more
atrocious
in
every
respect
than
the
penitentiaries
and
state
prisons
in
which
are
confined
men
convicted
of
felonies
the
allegheny
county
workhouse
of
the
great
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
enjoys
infamous
distinction
as
the
blackest
of
hells
where
men
expiate
the
sins
of
society
at
work
in
the
broom
shop
i
find
myself
in
peculiarly
familiar
surroundings
the
cupidity
of
the
management
has
evolved
methods
even
more
inhuman
than
those
obtaining
in
the
state
prison
the
tasks
imposed
upon
the
men
necessitate
feverish
exertion
insufficient
product
or
deficient
work
is
not
palliated
by
physical
inability
or
illness
in
the
conduct
of
the
various
industries
every
artifice
prevalent
in
the
penitentiary
is
practised
to
evade
the
law
limiting
convict
competition
the
number
of
men
employed
in
productive
work
by
far
exceeds
the
legally
permitted
percentage
the
provisions
for
the
protection
of
free
labor
are
skilfully
circumvented
the
tags
attached
to
the
shop
products
are
designed
to
be
obliterated
as
soon
as
the
wares
have
left
the
prison
the
words
stamped
on
the
are
pasted
over
with
labels
giving
no
indication
of
the
place
of
manufacture
the
law
symbolic
of
the
political
achievements
of
labor
is
frustrated
at
every
point
its
element
of
protection
a
lame
and
impotent
conclusion
how
significant
the
travesty
of
the
law
in
its
holy
of
holies
here
legal
justice
immures
its
victims
here
are
buried
the
disinherited
whose
rags
and
tatters
annoy
respectability
here
offenders
are
punished
for
breaking
the
law
and
here
the
law
is
daily
and
hourly
violated
by
its
pious
high
priests
iii
the
immediate
is
straining
at
the
leash
that
holds
memory
in
the
environment
of
the
penitentiary
yet
the
veins
of
the
terminated
existence
still
palpitate
with
the
recollection
of
friends
and
common
suffering
the
messages
from
riverside
are
wet
with
tears
of
misery
but
johnny
the
young
magyar
strikes
a
note
of
cheer
his
sentence
is
about
to
expire
he
will
devote
himself
to
the
support
of
the
little
children
he
had
so
unwittingly
robbed
of
a
father
meanwhile
he
bids
me
courage
and
hope
enclosing
two
dollars
from
the
proceeds
of
his
fancy
work
to
help
along
he
was
much
grieved
he
writes
at
his
inability
to
bid
me
a
last
farewell
because
the
warden
refused
the
request
signed
by
two
hundred
prisoners
that
i
be
allowed
to
pass
along
the
tiers
to
say
but
soon
soon
we
shall
see
each
other
in
freedom
words
of
friendship
glow
brightly
in
the
darkness
of
the
present
and
charm
my
visions
of
the
near
future
coming
liberty
casts
warming
rays
and
i
dwell
in
the
atmosphere
of
my
comrades
the
girl
and
the
chum
are
aglow
with
the
fires
of
young
russia
busily
my
mind
shapes
pictures
of
the
great
struggle
that
transplant
me
to
the
days
of
my
youth
in
the
little
tenement
flat
in
new
york
we
had
sketched
with
bold
stroke
the
fortunes
of
the
world
the
girl
the
twin
and
i
in
the
dark
kitchen
amid
the
smoke
of
the
asthmatic
stove
we
had
planned
our
conspirative
work
in
russia
but
the
need
of
the
hour
had
willed
it
otherwise
homestead
had
sounded
the
prelude
of
awakening
and
my
heart
had
echoed
the
inspiring
strains
the
banked
fires
of
aspiration
burst
into
life
what
matter
the
immediate
outcome
of
the
revolution
in
russia
the
yearning
of
my
youth
wells
up
with
spontaneous
power
to
live
is
to
struggle
to
struggle
against
caesar
side
by
side
with
the
people
to
suffer
with
them
and
to
die
if
need
be
that
is
life
it
will
sadden
me
to
part
with
chum
even
before
i
had
looked
deeply
into
the
devoted
face
but
the
girl
is
aflame
with
the
spirit
of
russia
it
will
be
joyous
work
in
common
the
soil
of
monongahela
laden
with
years
of
anguish
has
grown
dear
to
me
like
the
moan
of
a
broken
chord
wails
the
thought
of
departure
but
no
ties
of
affection
will
strain
at
my
heartstrings
yet
the
sweet
face
of
a
little
girl
breaks
in
on
my
reverie
a
look
of
reproaching
sadness
in
the
large
wistful
eyes
it
is
little
stella
the
last
years
of
my
penitentiary
life
have
snatched
many
a
grace
from
her
charming
correspondence
often
i
have
sought
consolation
in
the
beautiful
likeness
of
her
soulful
face
with
mute
tenderness
she
had
shared
my
grief
at
the
loss
of
harry
her
lips
breathing
sweet
balm
gray
days
had
warmed
at
her
smile
and
i
lavished
upon
her
all
the
affection
with
which
i
was
surcharged
it
will
be
a
violent
stifling
of
her
voice
in
my
heart
but
the
call
of
the
rings
clear
compelling
yet
who
knows
the
revolution
may
be
over
before
my
resurrection
in
republican
russia
with
her
enlightened
social
protestantism
life
would
be
fuller
richer
than
in
this
pitifully
democracy
freedom
will
present
the
unaccustomed
problem
of
but
it
is
premature
to
form
definite
plans
long
imprisonment
has
probably
incapacitated
me
for
hard
work
but
i
shall
find
means
to
earn
my
simple
needs
when
i
have
cast
off
the
fetters
of
my
involuntary
parasitism
the
thought
of
affection
the
love
of
woman
thrills
me
with
ecstasy
and
colors
my
existence
with
emotions
of
strange
bliss
but
the
solitary
hours
are
filled
with
recurring
dread
lest
my
life
forever
remain
bare
of
woman
love
often
the
fear
possesses
me
with
the
intensity
of
despair
as
my
mind
increasingly
dwells
on
the
opposite
sex
thoughts
of
woman
eclipse
the
memory
of
the
prison
affections
and
the
darkness
of
the
present
is
threaded
with
the
silver
needle
of
iv
the
monotony
of
the
routine
the
degradation
and
humiliation
weigh
heavier
in
the
shadow
of
liberty
my
strength
is
failing
with
the
hard
task
in
the
shop
but
the
hope
of
receiving
my
full
commutation
sustains
me
the
law
allows
five
months
good
time
on
every
year
beginning
with
the
ninth
year
of
a
sentence
but
the
superintendent
has
intimated
to
me
that
i
may
be
granted
the
benefit
of
only
two
months
as
a
new
prisoner
serving
the
first
year
of
a
workhouse
sentence
the
board
of
directors
will
undoubtedly
take
that
view
he
often
taunts
me
exasperation
at
his
treatment
coupled
with
my
protest
against
the
abuse
of
a
fellow
prisoner
have
caused
me
to
be
ordered
into
the
solitary
dear
chum
is
insistent
on
legal
steps
to
secure
my
full
commutation
notwithstanding
my
unconditional
refusal
to
resort
to
the
courts
he
has
initiated
a
campaign
to
achieve
his
object
the
time
drags
in
torturing
uncertainty
with
each
day
the
solitary
grows
more
stifling
maddening
till
my
brain
reels
with
terror
of
the
graveyard
silence
like
glad
music
sounds
the
stern
command
exercise
in
step
we
circle
the
yard
the
clanking
of
charley
chain
mournfully
beating
time
he
had
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
escape
for
which
he
is
punished
with
the
ball
and
chain
the
iron
cuts
into
his
ankle
and
he
trudges
painfully
under
the
heavy
weight
near
me
staggers
billy
his
left
side
completely
paralyzed
since
he
was
released
from
the
white
house
all
about
me
are
cripples
i
am
in
the
midst
of
the
social
refuse
the
lame
and
the
halt
the
broken
in
body
and
spirit
past
work
past
even
crime
these
were
the
blessed
of
the
nazarene
these
a
christian
world
breaks
on
the
wheel
they
too
are
within
the
scope
of
my
mission
they
above
all
others
these
the
living
indictments
of
a
leprous
system
the
excommunicated
of
god
and
man
the
threshold
of
liberty
is
thickly
sown
with
misery
and
torment
the
days
are
unbearable
with
nervous
restlessness
the
nights
hideous
with
the
hours
of
agonizing
stillness
the
endless
endless
hours
feverishly
i
pace
the
cell
the
day
will
pass
it
pass
with
reverent
emotion
i
bless
the
shamed
sun
as
he
dips
beyond
the
western
sky
one
day
nearer
to
the
liberty
that
awaits
me
with
unrestricted
sunshine
and
air
and
life
beyond
the
hated
walls
of
gray
out
in
the
daylight
in
the
open
the
open
world
the
scent
of
hay
is
in
my
nostrils
green
fields
and
forests
stretch
before
me
sweetly
ripples
the
mountain
spring
up
to
the
mountain
crest
to
the
breezes
and
the
sunshine
where
the
storm
breaks
in
its
wild
fury
upon
my
uncovered
head
welcome
the
rain
and
the
wind
that
sweep
the
foul
prison
dust
off
my
heart
and
blow
life
and
strength
into
my
being
tremblingly
rapturous
is
the
thought
of
freedom
out
in
the
woods
away
from
the
stench
of
the
cannibal
world
i
shall
wander
nor
lift
my
foot
from
soil
or
sod
close
to
the
breath
of
nature
i
will
press
my
parched
lips
on
her
bosom
i
will
pass
my
days
drinking
sustenance
and
strength
from
the
universal
mother
and
there
in
liberty
and
independence
in
the
vision
of
the
mountain
peaks
i
shall
voice
the
cry
of
the
social
orphans
of
the
buried
and
the
disinherited
and
visualize
to
the
living
the
yearning
menacing
face
of
pain
part
iv
the
resurrection
the
resurrection
i
all
night
i
toss
sleeplessly
on
the
cot
and
pace
the
cell
in
nervous
agitation
waiting
for
the
dawn
with
restless
joy
i
watch
the
darkness
melt
as
the
first
rays
herald
the
coming
of
the
day
it
is
the
of
may
my
last
day
my
very
last
a
few
more
hours
and
i
shall
walk
through
the
gates
and
drink
in
the
warm
sunshine
and
the
balmy
air
and
be
free
to
go
and
come
as
i
please
after
the
nightmare
of
thirteen
years
and
ten
months
in
jail
penitentiary
and
workhouse
my
step
quickens
with
the
excitement
of
the
outside
and
i
try
to
while
away
the
heavy
hours
thinking
of
freedom
and
of
friends
but
my
brain
is
in
a
turmoil
i
can
not
concentrate
my
thoughts
visions
of
the
near
future
images
of
the
past
flash
before
me
and
crowd
each
other
in
bewildering
confusion
again
and
again
my
mind
reverts
to
the
unnecessary
cruelty
that
has
kept
me
in
prison
three
months
over
and
above
my
time
it
was
sheer
sophistry
to
consider
me
a
new
prisoner
entitled
only
to
two
commutation
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
serving
the
last
year
of
a
sentence
and
therefore
i
should
have
received
five
months
time
off
the
superintendent
had
repeatedly
promised
to
inform
me
of
the
decision
of
the
board
of
directors
and
every
day
for
weeks
and
months
i
anxiously
waited
for
word
from
them
none
ever
came
and
i
had
to
serve
the
full
ten
months
ah
well
it
is
almost
over
now
i
have
passed
my
last
night
in
the
cell
and
the
morning
is
here
the
precious
blessed
morning
how
slowly
the
minutes
creep
i
listen
intently
and
catch
the
sound
of
bars
being
unlocked
on
the
bottom
range
it
is
the
night
captain
turning
the
kitchen
men
out
to
prepare
breakfast
two
and
a
half
hours
yet
before
i
shall
be
called
two
endless
hours
and
then
another
thirty
long
minutes
will
they
ever
pass
and
again
i
pace
the
cell
ii
the
gong
rings
the
rising
hour
in
great
agitation
i
gather
up
my
blankets
tincup
and
spoon
which
must
be
delivered
at
the
office
before
i
am
discharged
my
heart
beats
turbulently
as
i
stand
at
the
door
waiting
to
be
called
but
the
guard
unlocks
the
range
and
orders
me
to
fall
in
for
breakfast
the
striped
line
winds
down
the
stairs
past
the
deputy
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
hallway
and
slowly
circles
through
the
centre
where
each
man
receives
his
portion
of
bread
for
the
day
and
returns
to
his
tier
the
turnkey
on
his
rounds
of
the
range
casts
a
glance
into
my
cell
not
workin
he
says
mechanically
shutting
the
door
in
my
face
i
going
out
i
protest
not
till
you
called
he
retorts
locking
me
in
i
stand
at
the
door
tense
with
suspense
i
strain
my
ear
for
the
approach
of
a
guard
to
call
me
to
the
office
but
all
remains
quiet
a
vague
fear
steals
over
me
perhaps
they
will
not
release
me
i
may
be
losing
time
a
feeling
of
nausea
overcomes
me
but
by
a
strong
effort
i
throw
off
the
dreadful
fancy
and
quicken
my
step
i
must
not
think
not
think
at
last
the
lever
is
pulled
my
cell
unlocked
and
with
a
dozen
other
men
i
am
marched
to
the
in
single
file
and
lockstep
i
await
my
turn
impatiently
as
several
men
are
undressed
and
their
naked
bodies
scrutinized
for
contraband
or
hidden
messages
the
overseer
flings
a
small
bag
at
each
man
containing
the
prisoner
civilian
garb
shouting
boisterously
hey
you
take
off
them
clothes
and
put
your
rags
on
i
dress
hurriedly
a
guard
accompanies
me
to
the
office
where
my
belongings
are
returned
to
me
some
money
friends
had
sent
my
watch
and
the
piece
of
ivory
the
penitentiary
turnkey
had
stolen
from
me
and
which
i
had
insisted
on
getting
back
before
i
left
riverside
the
officer
in
charge
hands
me
a
railroad
ticket
to
pittsburgh
the
fare
costing
about
thirty
cents
and
i
am
conducted
to
the
prison
gate
iii
the
sun
shines
brightly
in
the
yard
the
sky
is
clear
the
air
fresh
and
bracing
now
the
last
gate
will
be
thrown
open
and
i
shall
be
out
of
sight
of
the
guard
beyond
the
bars
alone
how
i
have
hungered
for
this
hour
how
often
in
the
past
years
have
i
dreamed
of
this
rapturous
moment
to
be
alone
out
in
the
open
away
from
the
insolent
eyes
of
my
keepers
i
rush
away
from
these
walls
and
kneel
on
the
warm
sod
and
kiss
the
soil
and
embrace
the
trees
and
with
a
song
of
joy
give
thanks
to
nature
for
the
blessings
of
sunshine
and
air
the
outer
door
opens
before
me
and
i
am
confronted
by
reporters
with
cameras
several
tall
men
approach
me
one
of
them
touches
me
on
the
shoulder
turns
back
the
lapel
of
his
coat
revealing
a
police
star
and
says
berkman
you
are
to
leave
the
city
before
night
by
order
of
the
chief
the
detectives
and
reporters
trailing
me
to
the
nearby
railway
station
attract
a
curious
crowd
i
hasten
into
a
car
to
escape
their
insistent
gaze
feeling
glad
that
i
have
prevailed
upon
my
friends
not
to
meet
me
at
the
prison
my
mind
is
busy
with
plans
to
outwit
the
detectives
who
have
entered
the
same
compartment
i
have
arranged
to
join
the
girl
in
detroit
i
have
no
particular
reason
to
mask
my
movements
but
i
resent
the
surveillance
i
must
get
rid
of
the
spies
somehow
i
do
want
their
hateful
eyes
to
desecrate
my
meeting
with
the
girl
i
feel
dazed
the
short
ride
to
pittsburgh
is
over
before
i
can
collect
my
thoughts
the
din
and
noise
rend
my
ears
the
rushing
cars
the
clanging
bells
bewilder
me
i
am
afraid
to
cross
the
street
the
flying
monsters
pursue
me
on
every
side
the
crowds
jostle
me
on
the
sidewalk
and
i
am
constantly
running
into
the
the
turmoil
the
ceaseless
movement
disconcerts
me
a
horseless
carriage
whizzes
close
by
me
i
turn
to
look
at
the
first
automobile
i
have
ever
seen
but
the
living
current
sweeps
me
helplessly
along
a
woman
passes
me
with
a
child
in
her
arms
the
baby
looks
strangely
diminutive
a
rosy
dimple
in
the
laughing
face
i
smile
back
at
the
little
cherub
and
my
eyes
meet
the
gaze
of
the
detectives
a
wild
thought
to
escape
to
get
away
from
them
possesses
me
and
i
turn
quickly
into
a
side
street
and
walk
blindly
faster
and
faster
a
sudden
impulse
seizes
me
at
the
sight
of
a
passing
car
and
i
dash
after
it
fare
please
the
conductor
sings
out
and
i
almost
laugh
out
aloud
at
the
fleeting
sense
of
the
material
reality
of
freedom
conscious
of
the
strangeness
of
my
action
i
produce
a
dollar
bill
and
a
sense
of
exhilarating
independence
comes
over
me
as
the
man
counts
out
the
silver
coins
i
watch
him
closely
for
a
sign
of
recognition
does
he
realize
that
i
am
just
out
of
prison
he
turns
away
and
i
feel
thankful
to
the
dear
chum
for
having
so
thoughtfully
provided
me
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
it
is
peculiar
however
that
the
conductor
has
failed
to
notice
my
closely
cropped
hair
but
the
man
in
the
seat
opposite
seems
to
be
watching
me
perhaps
he
has
recognized
me
by
my
picture
in
the
newspapers
or
may
be
it
is
my
straw
hat
that
has
attracted
his
attention
i
glance
about
me
no
one
wears
summer
headgear
yet
it
must
be
too
early
in
the
season
i
ought
to
change
it
the
detectives
could
not
follow
me
so
easily
then
why
there
they
are
on
the
back
platform
at
the
next
stop
i
jump
off
the
car
a
hat
sign
arrests
my
eye
and
i
walk
into
the
store
and
then
slip
quietly
through
a
side
entrance
a
dark
derby
on
my
head
i
walk
quickly
for
a
long
long
time
board
several
cars
and
then
walk
again
till
i
find
myself
on
a
deserted
street
no
one
is
following
me
now
the
detectives
must
have
lost
track
of
me
i
feel
worn
and
tired
where
could
i
rest
up
i
wonder
when
i
suddenly
recollect
that
i
was
to
go
directly
from
the
prison
to
the
drugstore
of
comrade
m
my
friends
must
be
worried
and
m
is
waiting
to
wire
to
the
girl
about
my
release
it
is
long
past
noon
when
i
enter
the
drugstore
m
seems
highly
wrought
up
over
something
he
shakes
my
hand
violently
and
plies
me
with
questions
as
he
leads
me
into
his
apartments
in
the
rear
of
the
store
it
seems
strange
to
be
in
a
regular
room
there
is
paper
on
the
walls
and
it
feels
so
peculiar
to
the
touch
so
different
from
the
whitewashed
cell
i
pass
my
hand
over
it
caressingly
with
a
keen
sense
of
pleasure
the
chairs
too
look
strange
and
those
quaint
things
on
the
table
the
absorbs
my
attention
the
people
in
the
room
look
hazy
their
voices
sound
distant
and
confused
why
do
you
sit
down
aleck
the
tones
are
musical
and
tender
a
woman
no
doubt
yes
i
reply
walking
around
the
table
and
picking
up
a
bright
toy
it
represents
undine
rising
from
the
water
the
spray
glistening
in
the
sun
are
you
tired
aleck
n
no
you
have
just
come
out
yes
it
requires
an
effort
to
talk
the
last
year
in
the
workhouse
i
have
barely
spoken
a
dozen
words
there
was
always
absolute
silence
the
voices
disturb
me
the
presence
of
so
many
people
there
are
three
or
four
about
me
is
oppressive
the
room
reminds
me
of
the
cell
and
the
desire
seizes
me
to
rush
out
into
the
open
to
breathe
the
air
and
see
the
sky
i
going
i
say
snatching
up
my
hat
iv
the
train
speeds
me
to
detroit
and
i
wonder
vaguely
how
i
reached
the
station
my
brain
is
numb
i
can
not
think
field
and
forest
flit
by
in
the
gathering
dusk
but
the
surroundings
wake
no
interest
in
me
i
am
rid
of
the
detectives
the
thought
persists
in
my
mind
and
i
feel
something
relax
within
me
and
leave
me
cold
without
emotion
or
desire
with
an
effort
i
descend
to
the
platform
and
sway
from
side
to
side
as
i
cross
the
station
at
detroit
a
man
and
a
girl
hasten
toward
me
and
grasp
me
by
the
hand
i
recognize
carl
the
dear
boy
he
was
a
most
faithful
and
cheering
correspondent
all
these
years
since
he
left
the
penitentiary
but
who
is
the
girl
with
him
i
wonder
when
my
gaze
falls
on
a
woman
leaning
against
a
pillar
she
looks
intently
at
me
the
wave
of
her
hair
the
familiar
eyes
why
it
the
girl
how
little
she
has
changed
i
take
a
few
steps
forward
somewhat
surprised
that
she
did
not
rush
up
to
me
like
the
others
i
feel
pleased
at
her
the
excited
voices
the
quick
motions
disturb
me
i
walk
slowly
toward
her
but
she
does
not
move
she
seems
rooted
to
the
spot
her
hand
grasping
the
pillar
a
look
of
awe
and
terror
in
her
face
suddenly
she
throws
her
arms
around
me
her
lips
move
but
no
sound
reaches
my
ear
we
walk
in
silence
the
girl
presses
a
bouquet
into
my
hand
my
heart
is
full
but
i
can
not
talk
i
hold
the
flowers
to
my
face
and
mechanically
bite
the
petals
v
detroit
chicago
and
milwaukee
pass
before
me
like
a
troubled
dream
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
a
sea
of
faces
restless
and
turbulent
and
i
in
its
midst
confused
voices
beat
like
hammers
on
my
head
and
then
all
is
very
still
i
stand
in
full
view
of
the
audience
eyes
are
turned
on
me
from
every
side
and
i
grow
embarrassed
the
crowd
looks
dim
and
hazy
i
feel
hot
and
cold
and
a
great
longing
to
flee
the
perspiration
is
running
down
my
back
my
knees
tremble
violently
the
floor
is
slipping
from
under
my
feet
there
is
a
tumult
of
hand
clapping
loud
cheers
and
bravos
we
return
to
carl
house
and
men
and
women
grasp
my
hand
and
look
at
me
with
eyes
of
curious
awe
i
fancy
a
touch
of
pity
in
their
tones
and
am
impatient
of
their
sympathy
a
sense
of
suffocation
possesses
me
within
doors
and
i
dread
the
presence
of
people
it
is
torture
to
talk
the
sound
of
voices
agonizes
me
i
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
steal
out
of
the
house
it
soothes
me
to
lose
myself
among
the
crowds
and
a
sense
of
quiet
pervades
me
at
the
thought
that
i
am
a
stranger
to
every
one
about
me
i
roam
the
city
at
night
and
seek
the
outlying
country
conscious
only
of
a
desire
to
be
alone
vi
i
am
in
the
waldheim
the
girl
at
my
side
all
is
quiet
in
the
cemetery
and
i
feel
a
great
peace
no
emotion
stirs
me
at
the
sight
of
the
monument
save
a
feeling
of
quiet
sadness
it
represents
a
woman
with
one
hand
placing
a
wreath
on
the
fallen
with
the
other
grasping
a
sword
the
marble
features
mirror
unutterable
grief
and
proud
defiance
i
glance
at
the
girl
her
face
is
averted
but
the
droop
of
her
head
speaks
of
suffering
i
hold
out
my
hand
to
her
and
we
stand
in
mute
sorrow
at
the
graves
of
our
martyred
comrades
i
have
a
vision
of
stenka
razin
as
i
had
seen
him
pictured
in
my
youth
and
at
his
side
hang
the
bodies
of
the
men
buried
beneath
my
feet
why
are
they
dead
i
wonder
why
should
i
live
and
a
great
desire
to
lie
down
with
them
is
upon
me
i
clutch
the
iron
post
to
keep
from
falling
steps
sound
behind
me
and
i
turn
to
see
a
girl
hastening
toward
us
she
is
radiant
with
young
womanhood
her
presence
breathes
life
and
the
joy
of
it
her
bosom
heaves
with
panting
her
face
struggles
with
a
solemn
look
i
ran
all
the
way
her
voice
is
soft
and
low
i
was
afraid
i
might
miss
you
the
girl
smiles
let
us
go
in
somewhere
to
rest
up
alice
turning
to
me
she
adds
she
ran
to
see
you
how
peculiar
the
girl
should
conceive
such
an
idea
it
is
absurd
why
should
alice
be
anxious
to
see
me
i
look
old
and
worn
my
step
is
languid
unsteady
bitter
thoughts
fill
my
mind
as
we
ride
back
on
the
train
to
chicago
you
are
sad
the
girl
remarks
alice
is
very
much
taken
with
you
are
you
glad
you
are
mistaken
i
reply
i
sure
of
it
the
girl
persists
shall
i
ask
her
she
turns
to
alice
oh
i
like
you
so
much
sasha
alice
whispers
i
look
up
timidly
at
her
she
is
leaning
toward
me
in
the
abandon
of
artless
tenderness
and
a
great
joy
steals
over
me
as
i
read
in
her
eyes
frank
affection
vii
new
york
looks
unexpectedly
familiar
though
i
miss
many
old
landmarks
it
is
torture
to
be
indoors
and
i
roam
the
streets
experiencing
a
thrill
of
kinship
when
i
locate
one
of
my
old
haunts
i
feel
little
interest
in
the
large
meeting
arranged
to
greet
me
back
into
the
world
yet
i
am
conscious
of
some
curiosity
about
the
comrades
i
may
meet
there
few
of
the
old
guard
have
remained
some
dropped
from
the
ranks
others
died
john
most
will
not
be
there
i
cherished
the
hope
of
meeting
him
again
but
he
died
a
few
months
before
my
release
he
had
been
unjust
to
me
but
who
is
free
from
moments
of
weakness
the
passage
of
time
has
mellowed
the
bitterness
of
my
resentment
and
i
think
of
him
my
first
teacher
of
anarchy
with
admiration
his
unique
personality
stands
out
in
strong
relief
upon
the
flat
background
of
his
time
his
life
was
the
tragedy
of
the
ever
unpopular
pioneer
a
social
lear
his
whitening
years
brought
only
increasing
isolation
and
greater
lack
of
understanding
even
within
his
own
circle
he
had
struggled
and
suffered
much
he
gave
his
whole
life
to
advance
the
cause
only
to
find
at
the
last
that
he
who
crosses
the
threshold
must
leave
all
behind
even
friendship
even
comradeship
my
old
friend
justus
schwab
is
also
gone
and
brady
the
big
austrian
few
of
the
comrades
of
my
day
have
survived
the
younger
generation
seems
different
unsatisfactory
the
ghetto
i
had
known
has
also
disappeared
primitive
orchard
street
the
scene
of
our
pioneer
meetings
has
conformed
to
business
respectability
the
historic
lecture
hall
that
rang
with
the
breaking
chains
of
the
awakening
people
has
been
turned
into
a
the
little
café
around
the
corner
the
intellectual
arena
of
former
years
is
now
a
the
fervid
enthusiasm
of
the
past
the
spontaneous
comradeship
in
the
common
cause
the
intoxication
of
zeal
all
are
gone
with
the
days
of
my
youth
i
sense
the
spirit
of
cold
deliberation
in
the
new
set
and
a
tone
of
disillusioned
wisdom
that
chills
and
estranges
me
the
girl
has
also
changed
the
little
sailor
my
companion
of
the
days
that
thrilled
with
the
approach
of
the
social
revolution
has
become
a
woman
of
the
world
her
mind
has
matured
but
her
wider
interests
antagonize
my
old
revolutionary
traditions
that
inspired
every
day
and
colored
our
every
act
with
the
direct
perception
of
the
momentarily
expected
great
upheaval
i
feel
an
instinctive
disapproval
of
many
things
though
particular
instances
are
intangible
and
elude
my
analysis
i
sense
a
foreign
element
in
the
circle
she
has
gathered
about
her
and
feel
myself
a
stranger
among
them
her
friends
and
admirers
crowd
her
home
and
turn
it
into
a
sort
of
salon
they
talk
art
and
literature
discuss
science
and
philosophize
over
the
disharmony
of
life
but
the
groans
of
the
dungeon
find
no
gripping
echo
there
the
girl
is
the
most
revolutionary
of
them
all
but
even
she
has
been
infected
by
the
air
of
intellectual
aloofness
false
tolerance
and
everlasting
pessimism
i
resent
the
situation
the
more
i
become
conscious
of
the
chasm
between
the
girl
and
myself
it
seems
unbridgeable
we
can
not
recover
the
intimate
note
of
our
former
comradeship
with
pain
i
witness
her
evident
misery
she
is
untiring
in
her
care
and
affection
the
whole
circle
lavishes
on
me
sympathy
and
tenderness
but
through
it
all
i
feel
the
commiserating
tolerance
toward
a
sick
child
i
shun
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
and
flee
to
seek
the
solitude
of
the
crowded
streets
and
the
companionship
of
the
plain
untutored
underworld
in
a
bowery
resort
i
come
across
dan
my
assistant
on
the
range
during
my
last
year
in
the
penitentiary
hello
aleck
he
says
taking
me
aside
awful
glad
to
see
you
out
of
hell
doing
all
right
so
so
dan
and
you
rotten
aleck
rotten
you
know
it
was
my
first
bit
and
i
swore
never
do
a
crooked
job
again
well
they
turned
me
out
with
a
after
four
years
steady
work
mind
you
and
three
of
them
working
my
head
off
on
a
loom
then
they
handed
me
a
pair
of
kentucky
jeans
that
any
could
spot
a
mile
off
my
friends
went
back
on
me
that
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
and
it
did
go
a
long
way
liberty
ai
what
it
looks
to
a
fellow
through
the
bars
aleck
but
it
hell
to
go
back
i
do
know
what
to
do
how
do
you
happen
here
dan
could
you
get
no
work
at
home
in
oil
city
home
hell
i
wish
i
had
a
home
and
friends
like
you
aleck
christ
think
i
ever
turn
another
trick
but
i
got
no
home
and
no
friends
mother
died
before
i
came
out
and
i
found
no
home
i
got
a
job
in
oil
city
but
the
bulls
tipped
me
off
for
an
and
i
beat
my
way
here
i
tried
to
do
the
square
thing
aleck
but
where
a
fellow
to
turn
i
have
a
cent
and
not
a
friend
in
the
world
poor
dan
i
feel
powerless
to
help
him
even
with
advice
without
friends
or
money
his
liberty
is
a
hollow
mockery
even
worse
than
mine
five
years
ago
he
was
a
strong
healthy
young
man
he
committed
a
burglary
and
was
sent
to
prison
now
he
is
out
his
body
weakened
his
spirit
broken
he
is
less
capable
than
ever
to
survive
in
the
struggle
what
is
he
to
do
but
commit
another
crime
and
be
returned
to
prison
even
i
with
so
many
advantages
that
dan
is
lacking
with
kind
comrades
and
helpful
friends
i
can
find
no
place
in
this
world
of
the
outside
i
have
been
torn
out
and
i
seem
unable
to
take
root
again
everything
looks
so
different
changed
and
yet
i
feel
a
great
hunger
for
life
i
could
enjoy
the
sunshine
the
open
and
freedom
of
action
i
could
make
my
life
and
my
prison
experience
useful
to
the
world
but
i
am
incapacitated
for
the
struggle
i
do
not
fit
in
any
more
not
even
in
the
circle
of
my
comrades
and
this
seething
life
the
turmoil
and
the
noises
of
the
city
agonize
me
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
retire
to
the
country
and
there
lead
a
simple
life
close
to
nature
viii
the
summer
is
fragrant
with
a
thousand
perfumes
and
a
great
peace
is
in
the
woods
the
hudson
river
shimmers
in
the
distance
a
solitary
sail
on
its
broad
bosom
the
palisades
on
the
opposite
side
look
immutable
eternal
their
undulating
tops
melting
in
the
horizon
puffs
of
smoke
rise
from
the
valley
here
too
has
penetrated
the
restless
spirit
the
muffled
thunder
of
blasting
breaks
in
upon
the
silence
the
greedy
hand
of
man
is
desecrating
the
palisades
as
it
has
desecrated
the
race
but
the
big
river
flows
quietly
and
the
sailboat
glides
serenely
on
the
waters
it
skips
over
the
foaming
waves
near
the
spot
i
stand
on
toward
the
great
busy
city
now
it
is
floating
past
the
high
towers
with
their
forbidding
aspect
it
is
sing
sing
prison
men
groan
and
suffer
there
and
are
tortured
in
the
dungeon
and
i
i
am
a
useless
cog
an
idler
while
others
toil
and
i
keep
mute
while
others
suffer
my
mind
dwells
in
the
prison
the
silence
rings
with
the
cry
of
pain
the
woods
echo
the
agony
of
the
dungeon
i
start
at
the
murmur
of
the
leaves
the
trees
with
their
outstretched
arms
bar
my
way
menacing
me
like
the
guards
on
the
prison
walls
their
monster
shapes
follow
me
in
the
valley
at
night
i
wake
in
cold
terror
the
agonized
cry
of
crazy
smithy
is
in
my
ears
and
again
i
hear
the
sickening
thud
of
the
riot
clubs
on
the
prisoner
head
the
solitude
is
harrowing
with
the
memory
of
the
prison
it
haunts
me
with
the
horrors
of
the
basket
cell
away
i
must
away
to
seek
relief
amidst
the
people
back
in
the
city
i
face
the
problem
of
support
the
sense
of
dependence
gnaws
me
the
hospitality
of
my
friends
is
boundless
but
i
can
not
continue
as
the
beneficiary
of
their
generosity
i
had
declined
the
money
gift
presented
to
me
on
my
release
by
the
comrades
i
felt
i
could
not
accept
even
their
offering
the
question
of
earning
my
living
is
growing
acute
i
can
not
remain
idle
but
what
shall
i
turn
to
i
am
too
weak
for
factory
work
i
had
hoped
to
secure
employment
as
a
compositor
but
the
linotype
has
made
me
superfluous
i
might
be
engaged
as
a
my
former
membership
in
the
typographical
union
will
enable
me
to
join
the
ranks
of
labor
my
physical
condition
however
precludes
the
immediate
realization
of
my
plans
meanwhile
some
comrades
suggest
the
advisability
of
a
short
lecture
tour
it
will
bring
me
in
closer
contact
with
the
world
and
serve
to
awaken
new
interest
in
life
the
idea
appeals
to
me
i
shall
be
doing
work
useful
work
i
shall
voice
the
cry
of
the
depths
and
perhaps
the
people
will
listen
and
some
may
understand
ix
with
a
great
effort
i
persevere
on
the
tour
the
strain
is
exhausting
my
strength
and
i
feel
weary
and
discontented
my
innate
dread
of
public
speaking
is
aggravated
by
the
necessity
of
constant
association
with
people
the
comrades
are
sympathetic
and
attentive
but
their
very
care
is
a
source
of
annoyance
i
long
for
solitude
and
quiet
in
the
midst
of
people
the
old
prison
instinct
of
escape
possesses
me
once
or
twice
the
wild
idea
of
terminating
the
tour
has
crossed
my
mind
the
thought
is
preposterous
impossible
meetings
have
already
been
arranged
in
various
cities
and
my
appearance
widely
announced
it
would
disgrace
me
and
injure
the
movement
were
i
to
prove
myself
so
irresponsible
i
owe
it
to
the
cause
and
to
my
comrades
to
keep
my
appointments
i
must
fight
off
this
morbid
notion
my
engagement
in
pittsburgh
aids
my
determination
little
did
i
dream
in
the
penitentiary
that
i
should
live
to
see
that
city
again
even
to
appear
in
public
there
looking
back
over
the
long
years
of
imprisonment
of
persecution
and
torture
i
marvel
that
i
have
survived
surely
it
was
not
alone
physical
capacity
to
suffer
how
often
had
i
touched
the
threshold
of
death
and
trembled
on
the
brink
of
insanity
and
whatever
strength
and
perseverance
i
possessed
they
alone
could
not
have
saved
my
reason
in
the
night
of
the
dungeon
or
preserved
me
in
the
despair
of
the
solitary
poor
wingie
ed
sloane
and
fighting
tom
harry
russell
crazy
smithy
how
many
of
my
friends
have
perished
there
it
was
the
vision
of
an
ideal
the
consciousness
that
i
suffered
for
a
great
cause
that
sustained
me
the
very
exaggeration
of
my
was
a
source
of
strength
i
looked
upon
myself
as
a
representative
of
a
world
movement
it
was
my
duty
to
exemplify
the
spirit
and
dignity
of
the
ideas
it
embodied
i
was
not
a
prisoner
merely
i
was
an
anarchist
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
as
such
it
devolved
upon
me
to
maintain
the
manhood
and
my
ideals
signified
the
example
of
the
political
prisoners
in
russia
inspired
me
and
my
stay
in
the
penitentiary
was
a
continuous
struggle
that
was
the
breath
of
life
was
it
the
extreme
of
the
idealist
the
power
of
revolutionary
traditions
or
simply
the
persistent
will
to
be
most
likely
it
was
the
fusing
of
all
three
that
shaped
my
attitude
in
prison
and
kept
me
alive
and
now
on
my
way
to
pittsburgh
i
feel
the
same
spirit
within
me
at
the
threat
of
the
local
authorities
to
prevent
my
appearance
in
the
city
some
friends
seek
to
persuade
me
to
cancel
my
lecture
there
alarmed
at
the
police
preparations
to
arrest
me
something
might
happen
they
warn
me
legally
i
am
still
a
prisoner
out
on
parole
i
am
liable
to
be
returned
to
the
penitentiary
without
trial
for
the
period
of
my
commutation
time
eight
years
and
two
months
if
convicted
of
a
felony
before
the
expiration
of
my
full
sentence
of
years
but
the
menace
of
the
enemy
stirs
me
from
apathy
and
all
my
old
revolutionary
defiance
is
roused
within
me
for
the
first
time
during
the
tour
i
feel
a
vital
interest
in
life
and
am
eager
to
ascend
the
platform
an
unfortunate
delay
on
the
road
brings
me
into
pittsburgh
two
hours
late
for
the
lecture
comrade
m
is
impatiently
waiting
for
me
and
we
hasten
to
the
meeting
on
the
way
he
informs
me
that
the
hall
is
filled
with
police
and
prison
guards
the
audience
is
in
a
state
of
great
suspense
the
rumor
has
gone
about
that
the
authorities
are
determined
to
prevent
my
appearance
i
sense
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
as
i
enter
the
hall
and
elbow
my
way
through
the
crowded
aisle
some
one
grips
my
arm
and
i
recognize
southside
johnny
the
friendly
prison
runner
aleck
take
care
he
warns
me
the
bulls
are
layin
for
you
x
the
meeting
is
over
the
danger
past
i
feel
worn
and
tired
with
the
effort
of
the
evening
my
next
lecture
is
to
take
place
in
cleveland
ohio
the
ride
in
the
stuffy
smoker
aggravates
my
fatigue
and
sets
my
nerves
on
edge
i
arrive
in
the
city
feeling
feverish
and
sick
to
engage
a
room
in
a
hotel
would
require
an
extra
expense
from
the
proceeds
of
the
tour
which
are
intended
for
the
movement
moreover
it
would
be
sybaritism
contrary
to
the
traditional
practice
of
anarchist
lecturers
i
decide
to
accept
the
hospitality
of
some
friend
during
my
stay
in
the
city
for
hours
i
try
to
locate
the
comrade
who
has
charge
of
arranging
the
meetings
at
his
home
i
am
told
that
he
is
absent
his
parents
pious
jews
look
at
me
askance
and
refuse
to
inform
me
of
their
whereabouts
the
unfriendly
attitude
of
the
old
folks
drives
me
into
the
street
again
and
i
seek
out
another
comrade
his
family
gathers
about
me
their
curious
gaze
is
embarrassing
their
questions
idle
my
pulse
is
feverish
my
head
heavy
i
should
like
to
rest
up
before
the
lecture
but
a
constant
stream
of
comrades
flows
in
on
me
and
the
house
rings
with
their
joy
of
meeting
me
the
talking
wearies
me
their
ardent
interest
searches
my
soul
with
rude
hands
these
men
and
women
they
too
are
different
from
the
comrades
of
my
day
their
very
language
echoes
the
spirit
that
has
so
depressed
me
in
the
new
ghetto
the
abyss
in
our
feeling
and
thought
appalls
me
with
failing
heart
i
ascend
the
platform
in
the
evening
it
is
chilly
outdoors
and
the
large
hall
sparsely
filled
and
badly
lit
breathes
the
cold
of
the
grave
upon
me
the
audience
is
unresponsive
the
lecture
on
crime
and
prisons
that
so
thrilled
my
pittsburgh
meeting
wakes
no
vital
chord
i
feel
dispirited
my
voice
is
weak
and
expressionless
at
times
it
drops
to
a
hoarse
whisper
i
seem
to
stand
at
the
mouth
of
a
deep
cavern
and
everything
is
dark
within
i
speak
into
the
blackness
my
words
strike
metallically
against
the
walls
and
are
thrown
back
at
me
with
mocking
emphasis
a
sense
of
weariness
and
hopelessness
possesses
me
and
i
conclude
the
lecture
abruptly
the
comrades
surround
me
grasp
my
hand
and
ply
me
with
questions
about
my
prison
life
the
joy
of
liberty
and
of
work
they
are
undisguisedly
disappointed
at
my
anxiety
to
retire
but
presently
it
is
decided
that
i
should
accept
the
proffered
hospitality
of
a
comrade
who
owns
a
large
house
in
the
suburbs
the
ride
is
interminable
the
comrade
apparently
living
several
miles
out
in
the
country
on
the
way
he
talks
incessantly
assuring
me
repeatedly
that
he
considers
it
a
great
privilege
to
entertain
me
i
nod
sleepily
finally
we
arrive
the
place
is
large
but
squalid
the
low
ceilings
press
down
on
my
head
the
rooms
look
cheerless
and
uninhabited
exhausted
by
the
day
exertion
i
fall
into
heavy
sleep
awakening
in
the
morning
i
am
startled
to
find
a
stranger
in
my
bed
his
coat
and
hat
are
on
the
floor
and
he
lies
snoring
at
my
side
with
overshirt
and
trousers
on
he
must
have
fallen
into
bed
very
tired
without
even
detaching
the
large
cuffs
torn
and
soiled
that
rattle
on
his
hands
the
sight
fills
me
with
inexpressible
disgust
all
through
the
years
of
my
prison
life
my
nights
had
been
passed
in
absolute
solitude
the
presence
of
another
in
my
bed
is
unutterably
horrifying
i
dress
hurriedly
and
rush
out
of
the
house
a
heavy
drizzle
is
falling
the
air
is
close
and
damp
the
country
looks
cheerless
and
dreary
but
one
thought
possesses
me
to
get
away
from
the
stranger
snoring
in
my
bed
away
from
the
suffocating
atmosphere
of
the
house
with
its
low
ceilings
out
into
the
open
away
from
the
presence
of
man
the
sight
of
a
human
being
repels
me
the
sound
of
a
voice
is
torture
to
me
i
want
to
be
alone
always
alone
to
have
peace
and
quiet
to
lead
a
simple
life
in
close
communion
with
nature
ah
nature
that
too
i
have
tried
and
found
more
impossible
even
than
the
turmoil
of
the
city
the
silence
of
the
woods
threatened
to
drive
me
mad
as
did
the
solitude
of
the
dungeon
a
curse
upon
the
thing
that
has
incapacitated
me
for
life
made
solitude
as
hateful
as
the
face
of
man
made
life
itself
impossible
to
me
and
is
it
for
this
i
have
yearned
and
suffered
for
this
spectre
that
haunts
my
steps
and
turns
day
into
a
nightmare
this
distortion
life
oh
where
is
the
joy
of
expectation
the
tremulous
rapture
as
i
stood
at
the
door
of
my
cell
hailing
the
blush
of
the
dawn
the
day
of
resurrection
where
the
happy
moments
that
lit
up
the
night
of
misery
with
the
ecstasy
of
freedom
which
was
to
give
me
back
to
work
and
joy
where
where
is
it
all
is
liberty
sweet
only
in
the
anticipation
and
life
a
bitter
awakening
the
rain
has
ceased
the
sun
peeps
through
the
clouds
and
glints
its
rays
upon
a
shop
window
my
eye
falls
on
the
gleaming
barrel
of
a
revolver
i
enter
the
place
and
purchase
the
weapon
i
walk
aimlessly
in
a
daze
it
is
beginning
to
rain
again
my
body
is
chilled
to
the
bone
and
i
seek
the
shelter
of
a
saloon
on
an
obscure
street
in
the
corner
of
the
dingy
back
room
i
notice
a
girl
she
is
very
young
with
an
air
of
gentility
about
her
that
is
somewhat
marred
by
her
quick
restless
look
we
sit
in
silence
watching
the
heavy
downpour
outdoors
the
girl
is
toying
with
a
glass
of
whiskey
angry
voices
reach
us
from
the
street
there
is
a
heavy
shuffling
of
feet
and
a
suppressed
cry
a
woman
lurches
through
the
swinging
door
and
falls
against
a
table
the
girl
rushes
to
the
side
of
the
woman
and
assists
her
into
a
chair
are
you
hurt
madge
she
asks
sympathetically
the
woman
looks
up
at
her
with
bleary
eyes
she
raises
her
hand
passes
it
slowly
across
her
mouth
and
spits
violently
he
hit
me
the
dirty
brute
she
whimpers
he
hit
me
but
i
give
him
no
money
i
just
wo

the
girl
is
tenderly
wiping
her
friend
bleeding

a
glance
at

approaching
waiter

shoulder
so

all
right
in
a
minute
the
girl
sways
to
and
fro
gently
patting
the
woman
on
the
head
and
all
is
still
in
the
room
the
woman
breathing
grows
regular
and
louder
she
snores
and
the
young
girl
slowly
unwinds
her
arms
and
resumes
her
seat
i
motion
to
her
will
you
have
a
drink
with
me
with
pleasure
she
smiles
poor
thing

nods
toward

sleeper
her

her
and
takes
all
she
makes
you

a
kind
heart
frenchy

others
live
but
some

some
twirls

ai
all
like
that
and
she
hesitates
and
what
well
some
have
seen
better
days
i
was
always
like
this
she
adds
gulping
down
her
drink
her
face
is
pensive
her
large
black
eyes
look
dreamy
she
asks
abruptly
you
like
poetry
ye
es
why
i
write
oh
you
do
believe
me
do
you
here
something
of
mine
and
with
a
preliminary
cough
she
begins
to
recite
with
exaggerated
feeling
mother
dear
the
days
were
young
when
posies
in
our
garden
hung
upon
your
lap
my
golden
head
i
laid
with
pure
and
happy
heart
i
prayed
i
remember
those
days
she
adds
wistfully
we
sit
in
the
dusk
without
speaking
the
lights
are
turned
on
and
my
eye
falls
on
a
paper
lying
on
the
table
the
large
black
print
announces
an
excursion
to
buffalo
will
you
come
with
me
i
ask
the
girl
pointing
to
the
advertisement
to
buffalo
yes
you
kidding
no
will
you
come
sure
alone
with
me
in
the
stateroom
frenchy
grows
tender
and
playful
she
notices
my
sadness
and
tries
to
amuse
me
but
i
am
thinking
of
the
lecture
that
is
to
take
place
in
cleveland
this
very
hour
the
anxiety
of
my
comrades
the
disappointment
of
the
audience
my
absence
all
prey
on
my
mind
but
who
am
i
to
presume
to
teach
i
have
lost
my
bearings
there
is
no
place
for
me
in
life
my
bridges
are
burned
the
girl
is
in
high
spirits
but
her
jollity
angers
me
i
crave
to
speak
to
her
to
share
my
misery
and
my
grief
i
hint
at
the
impossibility
of
life
and
my
superfluity
in
the
world
but
she
looks
bored
not
grasping
the
significance
of
my
words
do
talk
so
foolish
boy
she
scoffs
what
do
you
care
about
work
or
a
place
you
got
money
what
more
do
you
want
you
better
go
down
now
and
fetch
something
to
drink
returning
to
the
stateroom
i
find
frenchy
missing
in
a
sheltered
nook
on
the
deck
i
recognize
her
in
the
lap
of
a
stranger
and
utterly
disgusted
i
retire
to
my
berth
in
the
morning
i
slip
quietly
off
the
boat
the
streets
are
deserted
the
city
is
asleep
in
the
fog
and
rain
the
gray
buildings
resemble
the
prison
walls
the
tall
factory
chimneys
standing
guard
like
monster
sentinels
i
hasten
away
from
the
hated
sight
and
wander
along
the
docks
the
mist
weaves
phantom
shapes
and
i
see
a
multitude
of
people
and
in
their
midst
a
boy
pale
with
large
lustrous
eyes
the
crowd
curses
and
yells
in
frenzied
passion
and
arms
are
raised
and
blows
rain
down
on
the
lad
head
the
rain
beats
heavier
and
every
drop
is
a
blow
the
boy
totters
and
falls
to
the
ground
the
wistful
face
the
dreamy
eyes
why
it
is
czolgosz
accursed
spot
i
can
not
die
here
i
must
to
new
york
to
be
near
my
friends
in
death
xi
loud
knocking
wakes
me
say
mister
a
voice
calls
behind
the
door
are
you
all
right
yes
will
you
have
a
bite
or
something
no
well
as
you
please
but
you
have
left
your
room
going
on
two
days
now
two
days
and
still
alive
the
road
to
death
is
so
short
why
suffer
an
instant
and
i
shall
be
no
more
and
only
the
memory
of
me
will
abide
for
a
little
while
in
this
world
world
is
there
another
if
there
is
anything
in
spiritualism
carl
will
learn
of
it
in
the
prison
we
had
been
interested
in
the
subject
and
we
had
made
a
compact
that
he
who
is
the
first
to
die
should
appear
in
spirit
to
the
other
pretty
fancy
of
foolish
man
born
of
immortal
vanity
hereafter
life
after
death
children
of
earth
misery
the
disharmony
of
life
bears
dreams
of
peace
and
bliss
but
there
is
no
harmony
save
in
death
who
knows
but
that
even
then
the
atoms
of
my
lifeless
clay
will
find
no
rest
tossed
about
in
space
to
form
new
shapes
and
new
thoughts
for
aeons
of
human
anguish
and
so
carl
will
not
see
me
after
death
our
compact
will
not
be
kept
for
nothing
will
remain
of
my
soul
when
i
am
dead
as
nothing
remains
of
the
sum
when
its
units
are
gone
dear
carl
he
will
be
distraught
at
my
failure
to
come
to
detroit
he
had
arranged
a
lecture
there
following
cleveland
it
is
peculiar
that
i
should
not
have
thought
of
wiring
him
that
i
was
unable
to
attend
he
might
have
suspended
preparations
but
it
did
not
occur
to
me
and
now
it
is
too
late
the
girl
too
will
be
in
despair
over
my
disappearance
i
can
not
notify
her
now
i
am
virtually
dead
yet
i
crave
to
see
her
once
more
before
i
depart
even
at
a
distance
but
that
also
is
too
late
i
am
almost
dead
i
dress
mechanically
and
step
into
the
street
the
brilliant
sunshine
the
people
passing
me
by
the
children
playing
about
strike
on
my
consciousness
with
pleasing
familiarity
the
desire
grips
me
to
be
one
of
them
to
participate
in
their
life
and
yet
it
seems
strange
to
think
of
myself
as
part
of
this
moving
breathing
humanity
am
i
not
dead
i
roam
about
all
day
at
dusk
i
am
surprised
to
find
myself
near
the
girl
home
the
fear
seizes
me
that
i
might
be
seen
and
recognized
a
sense
of
guilt
steals
over
me
and
i
shrink
away
only
to
return
again
and
again
to
the
familiar
spot
i
pass
the
night
in
the
park
an
old
man
a
sailor
out
of
work
huddles
close
to
me
seeking
the
warmth
of
my
body
but
i
am
cold
and
cheerless
and
all
next
day
i
haunt
again
the
neighborhood
of
the
girl
an
irresistible
force
attracts
me
to
the
house
repeatedly
i
return
to
my
room
and
snatch
up
the
weapon
and
then
rush
out
again
i
am
fearful
of
being
seen
near
the
den
and
i
make
long
detours
to
the
battery
and
the
bronx
but
again
and
again
i
find
myself
watching
the
entrance
and
speculating
on
the
people
passing
in
and
out
of
the
house
my
mind
pictures
the
girl
with
her
friends
about
her
what
are
they
discussing
i
wonder
why
myself
it
flits
through
my
mind
the
thought
appalls
me
they
must
be
distraught
with
anxiety
over
my
disappearance
perhaps
they
think
me
dead
i
hasten
to
a
telegraph
office
and
quickly
pen
a
message
to
the
girl
come
i
am
waiting
here
in
a
flurry
of
suspense
i
wait
for
the
return
of
the
messenger
a
little
girl
steps
in
and
i
recognize
tess
and
inwardly
resent
that
the
girl
did
not
come
herself
aleck
she
falters
sonya
was
home
when
your
message
came
run
to
find
her
the
old
dread
of
people
is
upon
me
and
i
rush
out
of
the
place
hoping
to
avoid
meeting
the
girl
i
stumble
through
the
streets
retrace
my
steps
to
the
telegraph
office
and
suddenly
come
face
to
face
with
her
her
appearance
startles
me
the
fear
of
death
is
in
her
face
mute
horror
in
her
eyes
sasha
her
hand
grips
my
arm
and
she
steadies
my
faltering
step
xii
i
open
my
eyes
the
room
is
light
and
airy
a
soothing
quiet
pervades
the
place
the
portières
part
noiselessly
and
the
girl
looks
in
awake
sasha
she
brightens
with
a
happy
smile
yes
when
did
i
come
here
several
days
ago
you
been
very
sick
but
you
feel
better
now
you
dear
several
days
i
try
to
recollect
my
trip
to
buffalo
the
room
on
the
bowery
was
it
all
a
dream
where
was
i
before
i
came
here
i
ask
you
you
were
absent
she
stammers
and
in
her
face
is
visioned
the
experience
of
my
disappearance
with
tender
care
the
girl
ministers
to
me
i
feel
like
one
recovering
from
a
long
illness
very
weak
but
with
a
touch
of
joy
in
life
no
one
is
permitted
to
see
me
save
one
or
two
of
the
girl
nearest
friends
who
slip
in
quietly
pat
my
hand
in
mute
sympathy
and
discreetly
retire
i
sense
their
understanding
and
am
grateful
that
they
make
no
allusion
to
the
events
of
the
past
days
the
care
of
the
girl
is
unwavering
by
degrees
i
gain
strength
the
room
is
bright
and
cheerful
the
silence
of
the
house
soothes
me
the
warm
sunshine
is
streaming
through
the
open
window
i
can
see
the
blue
sky
and
the
silvery
cloudlets
a
little
bird
hops
upon
the
sill
looks
steadily
at
me
and
chirps
a
greeting
it
brings
back
the
memory
of
dick
my
feathered
pet
and
of
my
friends
in
prison
i
have
done
nothing
for
the
agonized
men
in
the
dungeon
darkness
have
i
forgotten
them
i
have
the
opportunity
why
am
i
idle
the
girl
calls
cheerfully
sasha
our
friend
philo
is
here
would
you
like
to
see
him
i
welcome
the
comrade
whose
gentle
manner
and
deep
sympathy
have
endeared
him
to
me
in
the
days
since
my
return
there
is
something
unutterably
tender
about
him
the
circle
had
christened
him
the
philosopher
and
his
breadth
of
understanding
and
personality
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
me
his
voice
is
low
and
caressing
like
the
soft
crooning
of
a
mother
rocking
her
child
to
sleep
life
is
a
problem
he
is
saying
a
problem
whose
solution
consists
in
trying
to
solve
it
schopenhauer
may
have
been
right
he
smiles
with
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
but
his
love
of
life
was
so
strong
his
need
for
expression
so
compelling
he
had
to
write
a
big
book
to
prove
how
useless
is
all
effort
but
his
very
sincerity
disproves
him
life
is
its
own
justification
the
disharmony
of
life
is
more
seeming
than
real
and
what
is
real
of
it
is
the
folly
and
blindness
of
man
to
struggle
against
that
folly
is
to
create
greater
harmony
wider
possibilities
artificial
barriers
circumscribe
and
dwarf
life
and
stifle
its
manifestations
to
break
those
barriers
down
is
to
find
a
vent
to
expand
to
express
oneself
and
that
is
life
aleck
a
continuous
struggle
for
expression
it
mirrors
itself
in
nature
as
in
all
the
phases
of
man
existence
look
at
the
little
vine
struggling
against
the
fury
of
the
storm
and
clinging
with
all
its
might
to
preserve
its
hold
then
see
it
stretch
toward
the
sunshine
to
absorb
the
light
and
the
warmth
and
then
freely
give
back
of
itself
in
multiple
form
and
wealth
of
color
we
call
it
beautiful
then
for
it
has
found
expression
that
is
life
aleck
and
thus
it
manifests
itself
through
all
the
gradations
we
call
evolution
the
higher
the
scale
the
more
varied
and
complex
the
manifestations
and
in
turn
the
greater
the
need
for
expression
to
suppress
or
thwart
it
means
decay
death
and
in
this
aleck
is
to
be
found
the
main
source
of
suffering
and
misery
the
hunger
of
life
storms
at
the
gates
that
exclude
it
from
the
joy
of
being
and
the
individual
soul
multiplies
its
expressions
by
being
mirrored
in
the
collective
as
the
little
vine
mirrors
itself
in
its
many
flowers
or
as
the
acorn
individualizes
itself
a
thousandfold
in
the
oak
but
i
am
tiring
you
aleck
no
no
philo
continue
i
want
to
hear
more
well
aleck
as
with
nature
so
with
man
life
is
never
at
a
standstill
everywhere
and
ever
it
seeks
new
manifestations
more
expansion
in
art
in
literature
as
in
the
affairs
of
men
the
struggle
is
continual
for
higher
and
more
intimate
expression
that
is
progress
the
vine
reaching
for
more
sunshine
and
light
translated
into
the
language
of
social
life
it
means
the
individualization
of
the
mass
the
finding
of
a
higher
level
the
climbing
over
the
fences
that
shut
out
life
everywhere
you
see
this
reaching
out
the
process
is
individual
and
social
at
the
same
time
for
the
species
lives
in
the
individual
as
much
as
the
individual
persists
in
the
species
the
individual
comes
first
his
clarified
vision
is
multiplied
in
his
immediate
environment
and
gradually
permeates
through
his
generation
and
time
deepening
the
social
consciousness
and
widening
the
scope
of
existence
but
perhaps
you
have
not
found
it
so
aleck
after
your
many
years
of
absence
no
dear
philo
what
you
have
said
appeals
to
me
very
deeply
but
i
have
found
things
so
different
from
what
i
had
pictured
them
our
comrades
the
movement
it
is
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
it
is
quite
natural
aleck
a
change
has
taken
place
but
its
meaning
is
apt
to
be
distorted
through
the
dim
vision
of
your
long
absence
i
know
well
what
you
miss
dear
friend
the
old
mode
of
existence
the
living
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
revolution
so
to
speak
and
everything
looks
strange
to
you
and
out
of
joint
but
as
you
stay
a
little
longer
with
us
you
will
see
that
it
is
merely
a
change
of
form
the
essence
is
the
same
we
are
the
same
as
before
aleck
only
made
deeper
and
broader
by
years
and
experience
anarchism
has
cast
off
the
swaddling
bands
of
the
small
intimate
circles
of
former
days
it
has
grown
to
greater
maturity
and
become
a
factor
in
the
larger
life
of
society
you
remember
it
only
as
a
little
mountain
spring
around
which
clustered
a
few
thirsty
travelers
in
the
dreariness
of
the
capitalist
desert
it
has
since
broadened
and
spread
as
a
strong
current
that
covers
a
wide
area
and
forces
its
way
even
into
the
very
ocean
of
life
you
see
dear
aleck
the
philosophy
of
anarchism
is
beginning
to
pervade
every
phase
of
human
endeavor
in
science
in
art
in
literature
everywhere
the
influence
of
anarchist
thought
is
creating
new
values
its
spirit
is
vitalizing
social
movements
and
finding
interpretation
in
life
indeed
aleck
we
have
not
worked
in
vain
throughout
the
world
there
is
a
great
awakening
even
in
this
socially
most
backward
country
the
seeds
sown
are
beginning
to
bear
fruit
times
have
changed
indeed
but
encouragingly
so
aleck
the
leaven
of
discontent
ever
more
conscious
and
intelligent
is
moulding
new
social
thought
and
new
action
our
industrial
conditions
for
instance
present
a
different
aspect
from
those
of
twenty
years
ago
it
was
then
possible
for
the
masters
of
life
to
sacrifice
to
their
interests
the
best
friends
of
the
people
but
the
spontaneous
solidarity
and
awakened
consciousness
of
large
strata
of
labor
is
a
guarantee
against
the
repetition
of
such
judicial
murders
it
is
a
most
significant
sign
aleck
and
a
great
inspiration
to
renewed
effort
the
girl
enters
are
you
crooning
sasha
to
sleep
philo
she
laughs
oh
no
i
protest
i
wide
awake
and
much
interested
in
conversation
it
is
getting
late
he
rejoins
i
must
be
off
to
the
meeting
what
meeting
i
inquire
the
czolgosz
anniversary
commemoration
i
think
i
like
to
come
along
better
not
sasha
my
friend
advises
you
need
some
light
distraction
perhaps
you
would
like
to
go
to
the
theatre
the
girl
suggests
stella
has
tickets
she
be
happy
to
have
you
come
sasha
returning
home
in
the
evening
i
find
the
den
in
great
excitement
the
assembled
comrades
look
worried
talk
in
whispers
and
seem
to
avoid
my
glance
i
miss
several
familiar
faces
where
are
the
others
i
ask
the
comrades
exchange
troubled
looks
and
are
silent
has
anything
happened
where
are
they
i
insist
i
may
as
well
tell
you
philo
replies
but
be
calm
sasha
the
police
have
broken
up
our
meeting
they
have
clubbed
the
audience
and
arrested
a
dozen
comrades
is
it
serious
philo
i
am
afraid
it
is
they
are
going
to
make
a
test
case
under
the
new
anarchy
law
our
comrades
may
get
long
terms
in
prison
they
have
taken
our
most
active
friends
the
news
electrifies
me
i
feel
myself
transported
into
the
past
the
days
of
struggle
and
persecution
philo
was
right
the
enemy
is
challenging
the
struggle
is
going
on
i
see
the
graves
of
waldheim
open
and
hear
the
voices
from
the
tomb
a
deep
peace
pervades
me
and
i
feel
a
great
joy
in
my
heart
sasha
what
is
it
philo
cries
in
alarm
my
resurrection
dear
friend
i
have
found
work
to
do
