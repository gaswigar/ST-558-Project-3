dear
coney
your
letter
of
the
just
to
hand
how
glad
your
letters
make
me
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
to
tell
little
things
to
i
intended
to
write
you
as
soon
as
i
came
back
from
green
river
to
tell
you
of
a
girl
i
saw
there
but
there
was
a
heap
to
do
and
i
kept
putting
it
off
i
have
described
the
desert
so
often
that
i
am
afraid
i
will
tire
you
so
i
will
leave
that
out
and
tell
you
that
we
arrived
in
town
rather
late
the
help
at
the
hotel
were
having
their
supper
in
the
regular
as
all
the
guests
were
out
they
cheerfully
left
their
own
meal
to
place
ours
on
the
table
one
of
them
interested
me
especially
she
was
a
small
person
i
could
decide
whether
she
was
a
child
or
a
woman
i
kept
thinking
her
homely
and
then
when
she
spoke
i
forgot
everything
but
the
music
of
her
voice
it
was
so
restful
so
rich
and
mellow
in
tone
and
she
seemed
so
small
for
such
a
splendid
voice
somehow
i
kept
expecting
her
to
squeak
like
a
mouse
but
every
word
she
spoke
charmed
me
before
the
meal
was
over
it
came
out
that
she
was
the
all
the
rest
of
the
help
had
finished
their
work
for
the
day
but
she
of
course
had
to
wash
what
dishes
we
had
been
using
the
rest
went
their
ways
and
as
our
own
tardiness
had
belated
her
i
offered
to
help
her
to
carry
out
the
dishes
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
dry
them
so
i
did
that
she
was
so
small
that
she
had
to
stand
on
a
box
in
order
to
be
comfortable
while
she
washed
the
cups
and
plates
the
sink
and
were
made
for
real
folks
i
have
to
use
this
box
to
stand
on
or
else
the
water
runs
back
down
my
sleeves
she
told
me
my
room
was
upstairs
she
helped
me
up
with
the
children
she
said
her
name
was
connie
willis
that
she
was
the
only
one
of
her
ma
first
man
children
but
ma
married
again
after
pa
died
and
there
were
a
lot
of
the
second
batch
when
the
mother
died
she
left
a
baby
only
a
few
hours
old
as
connie
was
older
than
the
other
children
she
took
charge
of
the
household
and
of
the
tiny
little
baby
i
just
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
face
light
up
when
she
spoke
of
little
lennie
lennie
is
eight
years
old
now
and
she
is
just
as
smart
as
the
smartest
and
as
pretty
as
a
doll
all
the
ford
children
are
pretty
and
smart
too
i
am
the
only
homely
child
ma
had
it
would
do
you
good
just
to
look
at
any
of
the
rest
lennie
it
certainly
did
me
good
to
listen
to
connie
her
brave
patience
was
so
inspiring
as
long
as
i
was
in
town
she
came
every
day
when
her
work
was
finished
to
talk
to
me
about
lennie
for
herself
she
had
no
ambition
her
clothes
were
clean
but
they
were
odds
and
ends
that
had
served
their
day
for
other
possessors
her
shoes
were
not
mates
and
one
was
larger
than
the
other
she
said
i
thought
it
was
a
streak
of
luck
when
i
found
the
cook
always
wore
out
her
right
shoe
first
and
the
girl
the
left
because
you
see
i
could
have
their
old
ones
and
that
would
save
two
dollars
toward
what
i
am
saving
up
for
but
it
was
so
very
lucky
after
all
except
for
the
fun
because
the
cook
wears
low
heels
and
has
a
much
larger
foot
than
the
girl
who
wears
high
heels
but
i
chopped
the
long
heel
off
with
the
cleaver
and
these
shoes
have
saved
me
enough
to
buy
lennie
a
pair
of
slippers
to
wear
on
the
fourth
of
july
i
thought
that
a
foolish
ambition
but
succeeding
conversations
made
me
ashamed
of
the
thought
i
asked
her
if
lennie
father
could
take
care
of
her
oh
she
said
pa
ford
is
a
good
man
he
has
a
good
heart
but
there
so
many
of
them
that
it
is
all
he
can
do
to
rustle
what
must
be
had
why
she
told
me
in
a
burst
of
confidence
i
been
saving
up
for
a
tombstone
for
ma
for
twelve
years
but
i
have
to
help
pa
once
in
a
while
and
i
sometimes
think
i
never
will
get
enough
money
saved
it
is
kind
of
hard
on
three
dollars
a
week
and
then
i
kind
of
extravagant
at
times
i
have
wanted
a
doll
a
beautiful
one
all
my
days
last
christmas
i
got
it
for
lennie
and
then
i
like
to
carry
out
other
folks
wishes
sometimes
that
is
what
i
am
fixing
to
do
now
ma
always
wanted
to
see
me
dressed
up
real
pretty
just
once
but
we
were
always
too
poor
and
now
i
too
old
but
i
can
fix
lennie
and
this
fourth
of
july
i
am
going
to
put
all
the
beauty
on
her
that
ma
would
have
liked
to
see
on
me
they
always
celebrate
that
day
at
manila
utah
where
pa
lives
i
go
out
and
take
the
things
then
if
ma
is
where
she
can
see
she
see
of
her
girls
dressed
for
once
but
are
you
mistaken
when
you
say
you
have
been
saving
for
your
mother
tombstone
for
twelve
years
she
only
been
dead
eight
why
no
i
not
you
see
at
first
it
was
a
tombstone
but
a
dresser
ma
had
always
wanted
one
so
badly
for
she
always
thought
that
housekeeping
would
be
so
much
easier
if
she
had
just
one
pretty
thing
to
keep
house
toward
if
i
had
not
been
so
selfish
she
could
have
had
the
dresser
before
she
died
i
had
fifteen
dollars
enough
to
buy
it
but
when
i
came
to
look
in
the
catalogue
to
choose
one
i
found
that
for
fifteen
dollars
more
i
could
get
a
whole
set
i
thought
how
proud
ma
would
be
of
a
new
bedstead
and
so
i
set
in
to
earn
that
much
more
but
before
i
could
get
that
saved
up
ma
just
got
tired
of
living
waiting
and
doing
without
she
never
caused
any
trouble
while
she
lived
and
she
died
the
same
way
they
sent
for
me
to
come
home
from
the
place
where
i
was
at
work
i
had
just
got
home
and
i
was
standing
by
the
bed
holding
ma
hand
when
she
smiled
up
at
me
she
handed
me
lennie
and
then
turned
over
and
sighed
so
contented
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
she
was
done
with
hard
times
pa
ford
wanted
to
buy
her
coffin
on
credit
to
go
in
debt
for
it
but
i
hated
for
ma
to
have
to
go
on
that
way
even
after
she
was
dead
so
i
persuaded
him
to
use
what
money
he
had
to
buy
the
coffin
and
i
put
in
all
i
had
too
so
the
coffin
she
lies
in
is
her
own
we
do
owe
for
then
i
stayed
at
home
and
kept
house
and
cared
for
lennie
until
she
was
four
years
old
i
have
been
washing
dishes
in
this
hotel
ever
since
that
is
connie
story
after
she
told
me
i
went
to
the
landlady
and
suggested
that
we
help
a
little
with
lennie
finery
but
she
told
me
to
keep
out
i
doubt
if
connie
would
accept
any
help
from
us
and
if
she
did
every
cent
we
put
in
would
take
that
much
from
her
pleasure
there
have
not
been
many
happy
days
in
her
life
but
the
fourth
of
july
will
be
one
if
we
keep
out
so
i
kept
out
i
was
delighted
when
pearson
invited
me
to
accompany
her
to
manila
to
witness
the
bucking
contest
on
the
fourth
manila
is
a
pretty
little
town
situated
in
lucerne
valley
all
the
houses
in
town
are
the
homes
of
ranchers
whose
farms
may
be
seen
from
any
doorstep
in
manila
the
valley
lies
between
a
high
wall
of
red
sandstone
and
the
hogback
that
is
what
the
foothills
are
called
the
wall
of
sandstone
is
many
miles
in
length
the
valley
presents
a
beautiful
picture
as
you
go
eastward
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
alfalfa
is
so
green
each
farm
joins
another
each
has
a
cabin
in
which
the
rancher
lives
while
they
irrigate
and
make
hay
when
that
is
finished
they
move
into
their
houses
in
town
beyond
the
hogback
rise
huge
mountains
rugged
ca√±ons
and
noisy
mountain
streams
great
forests
of
pine
help
to
make
up
the
picture
looking
toward
the
east
we
could
see
where
mighty
green
river
cuts
its
way
through
walls
of
granite
the
road
lies
close
up
against
the
sandstone
and
cedar
hills
and
along
the
canal
that
carries
the
water
to
all
the
farms
in
the
valley
i
enjoyed
every
moment
it
was
all
so
beautiful
the
red
rock
the
green
fields
the
warm
brown
sand
of
the
road
and
bare
places
the
mighty
mountains
the
rugged
cedars
and
spicing
the
warm
air
the
blue
distance
and
the
fleecy
clouds
oh
i
wish
i
could
paint
it
for
you
in
the
foreground
there
should
be
some
cows
being
driven
home
by
a
barefooted
boy
with
a
gun
on
his
shoulder
and
a
limp
brown
rabbit
in
his
hand
but
i
shall
have
to
leave
that
to
your
imagination
and
move
on
to
the
fourth
on
that
day
every
one
turns
out
even
from
the
very
farthest
outlying
ranches
they
come
and
every
one
dressed
in
his
best
no
matter
what
privation
is
suffered
all
the
rest
of
the
time
on
this
day
every
one
is
dressed
to
kill
every
one
has
a
little
money
with
which
to
buy
gaudy
boxes
of
candy
every
girl
has
a
chew
of
gum
among
the
children
friendship
is
proved
by
invitations
to
share
lemons
they
cordially
invite
each
other
to
come
get
a
suck
o
my
lemon
i
just
to
watch
them
old
and
young
are
alike
whatever
may
trouble
them
at
other
times
is
forgotten
and
every
one
dances
eats
candy
sucks
lemons
laughs
and
makes
merry
on
the
fourth
i
did
care
much
for
their
contests
i
was
busy
watching
the
faces
soon
i
saw
one
i
knew
connie
was
making
her
way
toward
me
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
thought
her
plain
pride
lighted
every
feature
she
led
by
the
hand
the
most
beautiful
child
i
have
ever
seen
she
is
a
few
weeks
younger
than
jerrine
but
much
smaller
she
had
such
an
elusive
beauty
that
i
can
not
describe
it
one
not
acquainted
with
her
story
might
have
thought
her
dress
out
of
taste
out
among
the
sand
dunes
and
in
the
hot
sun
but
i
knew
and
i
felt
the
thrill
of
sheer
blue
silk
dainty
slippers
and
big
blue
hat
just
loaded
with
pink
footnote
the
author
daughter
aged
eight
this
is
my
lennie
said
connie
proudly
i
saw
all
the
ford
family
before
i
left
the
father
and
the
really
beautiful
girls
connie
was
neat
in
a
pretty
little
dress
cheap
but
becoming
and
her
shoes
were
mates
lennie
was
the
center
of
family
pride
she
represented
all
their
longings
before
i
left
connie
whispered
to
me
that
she
would
very
soon
have
money
enough
to
pay
for
her
mother
tombstone
then
i
will
have
had
everything
i
ever
wanted
i
guess
i
wo
have
anything
else
to
live
for
then
i
guess
i
will
have
to
get
to
wanting
something
for
lennie
on
our
way
home
even
the
mosquito
bites
did
annoy
me
i
was
too
full
of
connie
happiness
all
my
happiness
lacked
was
your
presence
if
i
had
had
you
beside
me
to
share
the
joy
and
beauty
i
could
have
asked
for
nothing
more
i
kept
saying
how
coney
would
enjoy
this
all
i
can
do
is
to
kind
of
hash
it
over
for
you
i
hope
you
like
hash
with
much
love
to
you
elinore
ii
the
start
in
camp
on
the
desert
august
dear
coney
at
last
we
are
off
i
am
powerfully
glad
i
shall
have
to
enjoy
this
trip
for
us
both
you
see
how
greedy
i
am
for
new
experiences
i
have
never
been
on
a
prolonged
hunt
before
so
i
am
looking
forward
to
a
heap
of
fun
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
about
writing
but
shall
try
to
write
every
two
days
i
want
you
to
have
as
much
of
this
trip
as
i
can
put
on
paper
so
we
will
begin
at
the
start
to
begin
with
we
were
all
to
meet
at
green
river
to
start
the
twentieth
but
a
professor
coming
from
somewhere
in
the
east
delayed
us
a
day
and
also
some
of
the
party
changed
their
plans
that
reduced
our
number
but
not
our
enthusiasm
a
few
days
before
we
left
the
ranch
i
telephoned
louderer
and
tried
to
persuade
her
to
go
along
but
she
replied
for
why
should
i
go
vat
iss
it
to
freeze
i
can
sleep
out
on
some
rocks
here
and
with
a
stick
i
can
beat
the
which
will
give
me
the
smell
you
will
smell
of
the
outside
and
for
the
game
i
can
have
a
beef
kill
which
iss
better
to
eat
as
elk
i
love
louderer
dearly
but
she
is
absolutely
devoid
of
imagination
and
her
is
mighty
trying
sometimes
however
she
sent
me
a
bottle
of
to
ward
off
colds
from
the
kinder
i
tried
but
she
was
plumb
aggravating
and
and
it
seemed
when
we
got
to
green
river
that
i
would
be
the
only
woman
in
the
party
besides
all
the
others
were
strangers
to
me
except
young
haynes
who
was
organizing
the
hunt
really
the
prospect
did
seem
so
joyous
the
afternoon
before
we
were
to
start
i
went
with
stewart
and
haynes
to
meet
the
train
we
were
expecting
the
professor
but
the
only
passenger
who
got
off
was
a
slight
girl
she
looked
about
her
uncertainly
for
a
moment
and
then
went
into
the
depot
while
we
returned
to
the
hotel
just
as
i
started
up
the
steps
my
eyes
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
in
her
buckboard
trotting
merrily
up
the
street
she
waved
her
hand
to
us
and
drove
up
clyde
took
her
team
to
the
livery
barn
and
she
came
up
to
my
room
with
me
it
going
with
you
i
am
she
began
ye
need
somebody
to
keep
yez
straight
and
to
sew
up
the
holes
ye
be
shooting
into
each
other
after
she
had
tidied
up
a
bit
we
went
down
to
supper
we
were
all
seated
at
one
table
and
there
was
yet
an
empty
place
but
soon
the
girl
we
had
seen
get
off
the
train
came
and
seated
herself
in
it
can
any
of
you
tell
me
how
to
get
to
kendall
wyoming
she
asked
i
did
know
nor
did
clyde
but
knew
so
she
answered
kendall
is
in
the
forest
reserve
up
north
it
is
two
hundred
miles
from
here
and
half
of
the
distance
is
across
desert
but
they
have
an
automobile
route
as
far
as
pinedale
you
could
get
that
far
on
the
auto
stage
after
that
i
suppose
you
could
get
some
one
to
take
you
on
thank
you
said
the
girl
my
name
is
elizabeth
hull
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
i
am
not
expected
at
kendall
so
i
am
obliged
to
ask
and
to
take
care
of
myself
at
once
mentioned
her
own
name
and
introduced
the
rest
of
us
after
supper
miss
hull
and
had
a
long
talk
i
was
not
much
surprised
when
came
in
to
tell
me
that
she
was
going
to
take
the
girl
along
because
she
said
kendall
is
on
our
way
and
it
glad
i
am
to
help
a
lone
girl
did
you
notice
the
freckles
of
her
sure
her
forbears
hailed
from
killarney
so
early
next
morning
we
were
astir
we
had
outfitted
in
green
river
so
the
wagons
were
already
loaded
i
had
rather
dreaded
the
professor
i
had
pictured
to
myself
a
very
dignified
bespectacled
person
and
i
mentally
stood
in
awe
of
his
great
learning
imagine
my
surprise
when
a
boyish
laughing
young
man
introduced
himself
as
professor
glenholdt
he
was
so
jolly
so
unaffected
and
so
altogether
likable
that
my
fear
vanished
and
i
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
his
company
haynes
and
his
friend
struble
on
their
wagon
led
the
way
then
we
followed
and
after
us
came
and
miss
hull
brought
up
the
rear
with
the
professor
riding
horseback
beside
first
one
wagon
and
then
another
so
we
set
out
there
was
a
great
jangling
and
banging
for
our
tin
kept
the
noise
going
neither
the
children
nor
i
can
ride
under
cover
on
a
wagon
we
get
so
sick
so
there
we
were
perched
high
up
on
great
rolls
of
bedding
and
a
tent
i
reckon
we
looked
funny
to
the
onlookers
looking
on
as
we
clattered
down
the
street
but
we
were
off
and
that
meant
a
heap
all
the
morning
our
way
lay
up
the
beautiful
river
past
the
great
red
cliffs
and
through
tiny
green
parks
but
just
before
noon
the
road
wound
itself
up
on
to
the
mesa
which
is
really
the
beginning
of
the
desert
we
crowded
into
the
shadow
of
the
wagons
to
eat
our
midday
meal
but
we
could
not
stop
long
because
it
was
miles
to
where
we
could
get
water
for
the
horses
when
we
should
camp
that
night
so
we
wasted
no
time
shortly
after
noon
we
could
see
white
clouds
of
alkali
dust
ahead
by
and
by
we
came
up
with
the
the
children
and
i
had
got
into
the
buckboard
with
and
miss
hull
so
as
to
ride
easier
and
be
able
to
gossip
and
we
had
driven
ahead
of
the
wagons
so
as
to
avoid
the
stinging
dust
the
sun
was
just
scorching
when
we
overtook
the
funniest
layout
i
have
seen
since
cora
belle
drove
up
to
our
door
the
first
time
in
a
wobbly
old
buckboard
sat
a
young
couple
completely
engrossed
by
each
other
that
he
was
a
westerner
we
knew
by
his
cowboy
hat
and
boots
that
she
was
an
easterner
by
her
not
knowing
how
to
dress
for
the
ride
across
the
desert
she
wore
a
foolish
little
chiffon
hat
which
the
alkali
dust
had
ruined
and
all
the
rest
of
her
clothes
matched
but
over
them
the
enterprising
young
man
had
raised
one
of
those
big
old
sunshades
that
had
lettering
on
them
it
kept
wobbling
about
in
the
socket
he
had
improvised
one
minute
we
could
see
tea
then
a
rut
in
the
road
would
swing
coffee
around
their
sunshade
kept
revolving
about
that
way
and
sometimes
their
heads
revolved
a
little
bit
too
we
could
hear
a
word
occasionally
and
knew
they
were
having
a
great
deal
of
fun
at
our
expense
but
we
were
amused
ourselves
so
we
did
care
they
would
drive
along
slowly
until
we
almost
reached
them
then
they
would
whip
up
and
raise
such
a
dust
that
we
were
almost
choked
footnote
the
story
of
cora
belle
is
told
in
of
a
woman
determined
to
drive
ahead
so
she
trotted
up
alongside
but
she
could
not
get
ahead
the
young
people
were
giggling
does
like
to
be
the
joke
all
the
time
suddenly
she
leaned
over
toward
them
and
said
will
ye
tell
me
something
oh
yes
they
would
then
she
said
which
of
you
are
tea
and
which
coffee
their
answer
was
to
drive
up
faster
and
stir
up
a
powerful
lot
of
dust
they
kept
pretty
well
ahead
after
that
but
at
sundown
we
came
up
with
them
at
the
well
where
we
were
to
camp
this
well
had
been
sunk
by
the
county
for
the
convenience
of
travelers
and
we
were
mighty
thankful
to
find
it
it
came
out
that
our
young
couple
were
bride
and
groom
they
had
never
seen
each
other
until
the
night
before
having
met
through
a
matrimonial
paper
they
had
met
in
green
river
and
were
married
that
morning
and
the
young
husband
was
taking
her
away
up
to
pinedale
to
his
ranch
they
must
have
been
ideally
happy
for
they
had
forgotten
their
and
had
only
a
light
lunch
they
had
only
their
for
bedding
they
were
in
a
predicament
but
the
girl
chief
concern
was
lest
should
let
the
wolves
get
her
though
it
is
scorching
hot
on
the
desert
by
day
the
nights
are
keenly
cool
and
i
was
wondering
how
they
would
manage
with
only
their
when
who
can
not
hold
malice
made
a
round
of
the
camp
getting
a
blanket
here
and
a
coat
there
until
she
had
enough
to
make
them
comfortable
then
she
invited
them
to
take
their
meals
with
us
until
they
could
get
to
where
they
could
help
themselves
i
think
we
all
enjoyed
camp
that
night
for
we
were
all
tired
we
were
in
a
shallow
little
ca√±on
not
a
tree
not
even
a
bush
except
luckily
there
was
plenty
of
that
so
we
had
roaring
fires
we
sat
around
the
fire
talking
as
the
blue
shadows
faded
into
gray
dusk
and
the
big
stars
came
out
the
were
as
the
bride
put
it
so
full
of
happiness
they
had
nothing
to
put
it
in
certainly
their
spirits
overflowed
they
were
eager
to
talk
of
themselves
and
we
did
mind
listening
they
are
and
tom
burney
she
is
the
oldest
of
a
large
family
of
children
and
has
had
to
work
out
ever
since
she
was
big
enough
to
get
a
job
the
people
she
had
worked
for
rather
frowned
upon
any
matrimonial
ventures
and
as
no
provision
was
made
for
help
entertaining
company
she
had
never
had
a
beau
one
day
she
got
hold
of
a
matrimonial
paper
and
saw
burney
ad
she
answered
and
they
corresponded
for
several
months
we
were
just
in
time
to
catch
it
as
haynes
who
is
a
confirmed
bachelor
disgustedly
remarked
personally
i
am
glad
i
like
them
much
better
than
i
thought
i
should
when
they
were
raising
so
much
dust
so
unnecessarily
i
must
close
this
letter
as
i
see
the
men
are
about
ready
to
start
the
children
are
standing
the
trip
well
except
that
robert
is
a
little
did
i
tell
you
we
left
junior
with
his
grandmother
even
though
i
have
the
other
three
my
heart
is
hungry
for
my
big
boy
who
is
only
a
baby
too
he
is
such
a
precious
little
man
i
wish
you
could
see
him
with
a
heart
very
full
of
love
for
you
iii
eden
valley
in
camp
august
dear
coney
we
are
almost
across
the
desert
and
i
am
really
becoming
interested
the
difficulties
some
folks
work
under
are
enough
to
make
many
of
us
ashamed
in
the
very
center
of
the
desert
is
a
little
settlement
called
eden
valley
imagination
must
have
had
a
heap
to
do
with
its
name
but
one
thing
is
certain
the
serpent
will
find
the
crawling
rather
bad
if
he
attempts
to
enter
eden
for
the
sand
is
hot
the
alkali
and
the
cactus
are
there
so
it
must
be
a
serpentless
eden
the
settlers
have
made
a
long
canal
and
bring
their
water
many
miles
they
say
the
soil
is
splendid
and
they
do
have
much
stone
but
it
is
such
a
flat
place
i
wonder
how
they
get
the
water
to
run
when
they
irrigate
we
saw
many
deserted
homes
hope
skeletons
they
are
with
their
yawning
doors
and
windows
like
eyeless
sockets
some
of
the
houses
which
looked
as
if
they
were
deserted
held
families
we
camped
near
one
such
and
i
went
up
to
the
house
to
buy
some
eggs
a
woman
came
to
the
door
the
hot
winds
and
the
alkali
dust
had
tanned
her
skin
and
bleached
her
hair
both
were
a
her
eyes
were
blue
but
were
so
that
i
could
hardly
see
for
the
tears
no
she
said
we
ai
got
no
eggs
we
ai
got
no
chickens
you
see
this
ground
is
sandy
and
last
year
the
wind
blowed
awful
hard
and
all
the
grain
blowed
out
so
we
did
have
no
chance
to
raise
chickens
we
had
no
feed
and
no
money
to
buy
feed
so
we
had
to
kill
our
chickens
to
save
their
lives
we
et
they
would
have
starved
anyway
then
we
tried
for
some
vegetables
well
she
said
they
ai
much
to
look
at
maybe
you
not
want
our
garden
ai
much
this
year
pa
has
had
to
work
out
all
the
time
the
kids
and
me
put
in
some
seed
all
we
had
with
a
hoe
we
ai
got
no
horse
our
team
died
last
winter
we
did
have
much
feed
and
it
was
shore
a
hard
winter
we
hated
to
see
old
nick
and
fanny
die
they
were
just
like
ones
of
the
family
we
drove
clean
from
missouri
too
but
they
died
and
what
hurt
me
most
was
pa
it
would
be
a
turrible
waste
not
to
skin
i
begged
him
not
to
land
knows
the
pore
old
things
was
entitled
to
their
hides
they
got
so
little
else
but
pa
said
it
did
make
no
difference
to
them
whether
they
had
any
hide
or
not
and
that
the
skins
would
sell
for
enough
to
get
the
kids
some
shoes
and
they
did
a
jew
junk
man
came
through
and
give
pa
three
dollars
for
the
two
hides
and
that
paid
for
a
pair
each
for
johnny
and
eller
pa
hated
as
bad
as
we
did
to
lose
our
faithful
old
friends
and
all
the
winter
long
we
grieved
the
kids
and
me
every
time
the
coyotes
yelped
we
knew
they
were
gathering
to
gnaw
poor
old
nick
and
bones
and
pa
to
keep
from
crying
himself
when
the
kids
and
me
would
be
sobbin
would
scold
us
goodness
he
would
say
horses
are
dead
and
they
do
know
nothin
about
cold
and
hunger
they
know
nothin
about
sore
shoulders
and
hard
pulls
now
so
why
do
you
shut
up
and
let
them
and
me
rest
in
peace
but
that
was
only
pa
way
of
hidin
the
tears
when
spring
came
the
kids
and
me
gathered
all
the
bones
and
hair
we
could
find
of
our
good
old
team
and
buried
where
you
see
that
green
spot
that
grass
we
scooped
all
the
trash
out
of
the
mangers
and
spread
it
over
the
grave
and
the
timothy
and
the
redtop
seed
in
the
trash
came
up
and
growed
i
liked
to
have
put
some
flowers
there
but
we
had
no
seed
she
wiped
her
face
on
her
apron
and
gathered
an
armful
of
cabbage
it
had
not
headed
but
was
the
best
she
had
seemed
possessed
she
bought
stuff
she
knew
she
would
have
to
throw
away
but
she
did
offer
one
word
of
sympathy
i
felt
plumb
out
of
patience
with
her
for
usually
she
can
say
the
most
comforting
things
why
do
you
leave
this
place
why
not
go
away
somewhere
else
where
it
will
not
be
so
hard
to
start
i
asked
oh
pa
heart
is
just
set
on
making
a
go
of
it
here
and
we
would
be
just
as
pore
anywhere
else
we
have
tried
a
heap
of
times
to
start
a
home
and
we
worked
hard
but
we
were
never
so
pore
before
we
have
been
here
three
years
and
we
can
prove
up
soon
then
maybe
we
can
go
away
and
work
somewhere
enough
to
get
a
team
anyway
pa
has
already
worked
out
his
he
got
water
for
all
his
land
paid
for
if
we
only
had
a
team
to
plough
with
but
we
get
it
been
workin
all
summer
in
the
hay
and
he
ought
to
have
a
little
stake
saved
then
the
will
be
bringin
in
their
herds
soon
frost
comes
and
pa
to
get
a
job
herdin
anyway
we
got
to
stick
we
ai
got
no
way
to
get
away
and
all
we
got
is
right
here
every
last
dollar
we
had
has
went
into
improvin
this
place
if
pore
old
pa
can
stand
it
the
kids
and
me
can
we
seen
pa
for
two
months
not
sence
hayin
began
but
we
work
all
we
can
to
shorten
the
days
and
we
sure
do
miss
pore
old
nick
and
fan
we
gathered
up
as
much
of
the
vegetables
as
we
could
carry
paid
and
we
started
homeward
promising
to
send
for
the
rest
of
the
beets
and
potatoes
on
the
way
we
met
two
children
and
knew
them
at
once
for
johnny
and
eller
they
had
pails
and
were
carrying
water
from
the
stream
and
pouring
it
on
the
green
spot
that
covered
nick
and
fan
we
promised
them
each
a
dime
if
they
would
bring
the
vegetables
we
had
left
their
little
faces
shone
and
we
had
to
hurry
all
we
could
to
get
supper
ready
before
they
came
for
we
were
determined
they
should
eat
supper
with
us
we
told
the
men
before
the
little
tykes
came
so
struble
let
johnny
shoot
his
gun
and
both
youngsters
rode
chub
and
antifat
to
water
they
were
bright
little
folks
and
their
outlook
upon
life
is
not
so
flat
and
colorless
as
their
mother
is
a
day
holds
a
world
of
chance
for
them
they
were
saving
their
money
they
told
us
to
buy
some
house
plants
for
ma
johnny
had
a
dollar
which
a
had
given
him
for
taking
care
of
a
dog
ella
had
a
dime
which
a
man
had
given
her
for
filling
his
they
both
hoped
to
pull
wool
off
dead
sheep
and
make
some
more
money
that
way
they
had
quite
made
up
their
minds
about
what
they
wanted
to
get
it
must
be
house
plants
for
ma
but
still
they
both
wished
they
could
get
some
little
thing
for
pa
they
were
not
pert
or
forward
in
any
way
but
they
answered
readily
and
we
all
drew
them
out
even
the
after
supper
the
men
took
their
guns
and
went
out
to
shoot
johnny
went
with
haynes
and
struble
miss
hull
walked
back
with
ella
and
we
sent
sanders
a
few
cans
of
fruit
and
i
washed
the
dishes
we
were
talking
of
the
sanders
family
was
disgusted
with
me
because
i
wept
you
think
it
is
a
soft
heart
you
have
but
it
is
only
your
head
that
is
soft
of
course
they
are
having
a
hard
time
what
of
it
the
very
root
of
independence
is
hard
times
that
the
way
america
was
founded
that
is
why
it
stands
so
firmly
hard
times
is
what
makes
sound
characters
and
them
kids
are
getting
a
new
hold
on
character
that
was
very
near
run
to
seed
in
the
parents
johnny
will
be
yet
i
bet
you
and
you
just
watch
that
eller
it
wo
surprise
me
a
bit
to
see
her
county
superintendent
of
schools
the
parents
most
likely
never
would
make
anything
but
having
just
only
a
pa
and
a
ma
and
getting
the
very
hard
licks
them
kids
are
getting
now
is
what
is
going
to
make
them
something
more
than
a
pa
and
a
ma
is
very
wise
but
sometimes
she
seems
absolutely
heartless
the
men
did
bring
back
much
game
each
had
left
a
share
with
sanders
next
morning
we
were
astir
early
we
pulled
out
of
camp
just
as
the
first
level
rays
of
the
sun
shot
across
the
desolate
flat
country
we
crossed
the
flat
little
stream
with
its
soft
sandy
banks
a
willow
here
and
there
along
the
bank
and
the
blue
distant
mountains
and
some
lonesome
buttes
were
all
there
was
to
break
the
monotony
yet
we
saw
some
places
with
many
haystacks
i
looked
back
once
toward
the
sanders
cabin
the
blue
smoke
was
just
beginning
to
curl
upward
from
the
stove
pipe
the
green
spot
looked
vividly
green
against
the
dim
prospect
poor
pa
and
poor
ma
even
if
they
could
be
more
i
wish
at
least
that
they
need
not
have
given
up
nick
and
fan
haynes
told
us
at
breakfast
that
we
would
camp
only
one
more
night
on
the
desert
i
am
so
glad
of
that
the
will
leave
us
in
two
more
days
i
rather
sorry
they
are
much
nicer
than
i
thought
they
would
be
they
have
invited
us
to
stay
with
them
on
our
way
back
well
i
must
stop
i
wish
i
could
put
some
of
this
clean
morning
air
inside
your
apartments
with
much
love
iv
crazy
olaf
and
others
in
camp
august
dear
coney
we
are
across
the
desert
and
camped
for
a
few
days
fishing
on
a
shady
bowery
little
stream
we
have
had
two
frosty
nights
and
there
are
trembling
golden
groves
on
every
hand
four
men
joined
us
at
newfork
and
the
bachelors
have
gone
on
but
stewart
wanted
to
rest
the
beasties
and
we
all
wanted
to
fish
so
we
camped
for
a
day
or
two
the
was
the
warmest
day
we
have
had
the
most
disagreeable
in
every
way
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
except
an
occasional
whirlwind
which
was
hot
and
threw
sand
and
dust
over
us
we
could
see
the
heat
glimmering
and
not
a
tree
nor
a
green
spot
the
mountains
looked
no
nearer
i
am
afraid
we
rather
wished
we
were
at
home
water
was
getting
very
scarce
so
the
men
wanted
to
reach
by
noon
a
long
low
valley
they
knew
of
for
sometimes
water
could
be
found
in
a
buried
there
and
they
hoped
to
find
enough
for
the
horses
but
a
little
after
noon
we
came
to
the
spot
and
only
dry
glistening
sand
met
our
eyes
the
men
emptied
the
for
the
horses
they
all
had
a
little
water
we
had
to
be
saving
so
none
of
us
washed
our
faces
we
were
sitting
in
the
scant
shadow
of
the
wagons
eating
our
dinner
when
we
were
startled
to
see
a
tall
man
come
racing
down
the
draw
his
clothes
and
shoes
were
in
tatters
there
were
great
blisters
on
his
arms
and
shoulders
where
the
sun
had
burned
him
his
eyes
were
swollen
and
red
and
his
lips
were
cracked
and
bloody
his
hair
was
so
white
and
so
dusty
that
altogether
he
was
a
object
he
greeted
us
pleasantly
and
said
that
his
name
was
olaf
swanson
and
that
he
was
a
that
he
had
seen
us
and
had
come
to
ask
for
a
little
smoking
by
that
he
meant
tobacco
was
eyeing
him
very
closely
she
asked
him
when
he
had
eaten
that
morning
he
said
she
asked
him
he
had
eaten
he
told
her
cactus
balls
and
a
little
rabbit
i
saw
her
exchange
glances
with
professor
glenholdt
and
she
left
her
dinner
to
get
out
her
she
called
olaf
aside
and
gently
dressed
his
blisters
with
listerine
after
she
had
helped
him
to
clean
his
mouth
she
said
to
him
now
olaf
sit
by
me
and
eat
show
me
how
much
you
can
eat
then
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
saying
you
are
a
do
you
think
we
know
there
will
be
no
sheep
on
the
desert
before
there
is
snow
to
make
water
for
them
i
am
what
i
say
i
am
he
said
i
am
not
herding
now
because
sorrow
has
drove
me
to
dig
wells
it
is
sorrow
for
horses
have
you
not
seen
their
bones
every
mile
or
so
along
this
road
them
markers
every
pile
of
bones
marks
where
man
most
faithful
friend
has
laid
down
at
last
most
of
died
in
the
harness
and
for
want
of
water
i
killed
a
horse
once
i
was
trying
to
have
a
good
time
i
had
been
out
with
sheep
for
months
and
had
seen
any
one
but
my
pardner
we
planned
to
have
a
rippin
good
time
when
we
took
the
sheep
in
off
the
summer
range
and
drew
our
pay
you
do
know
how
a
man
gets
livin
out
so
my
pardner
and
me
layed
out
to
have
one
spree
we
had
a
neat
little
bunch
of
money
but
when
we
got
to
town
we
felt
lost
as
sheep
we
did
know
nobody
but
the
bartender
we
kept
taking
a
drink
now
and
then
just
so
as
to
have
him
to
talk
to
finally
he
told
us
there
was
going
to
be
a
dance
that
night
so
we
asked
around
and
found
we
could
get
tickets
for
two
dollars
each
sam
said
he
like
to
go
we
bought
tickets
somehow
or
another
they
knew
us
for
and
every
once
in
a
while
somebody
would
at
us
we
had
a
couple
of
dances
but
after
that
we
could
get
a
pardner
after
midnight
things
begun
to
get
pretty
noisy
sam
and
me
was
settin
wonderin
if
we
were
havin
a
good
time
when
a
fellow
stepped
on
sam
foot
and
said
i
rose
up
and
was
goin
to
smash
him
but
sam
collared
me
and
said
get
away
from
here
olaf
before
trouble
breaks
out
it
sounded
as
if
every
man
in
the
house
and
some
of
the
women
were
we
were
pretty
near
the
door
when
a
man
put
his
hand
to
his
nose
and
i
knocked
him
down
and
before
you
could
bat
your
eye
everybody
was
fightin
we
could
get
out
so
we
backed
into
a
corner
and
every
man
my
fist
hit
rested
on
the
floor
till
somebody
helped
him
away
a
fellow
hit
me
on
the
head
with
a
chair
and
i
know
how
i
finished
or
got
out
the
first
thing
i
remember
after
that
was
feeling
the
greasewood
thorns
tearing
my
flesh
and
my
clothes
next
day
we
were
away
out
on
the
desert
not
far
from
north
pilot
butte
poor
sam
could
speak
i
got
him
off
poor
old
pinto
and
took
off
the
saddle
for
a
pillow
for
him
i
hung
the
on
a
greasewood
so
as
to
shade
his
face
then
i
got
on
my
own
poor
horse
poor
old
billy
and
started
to
hunt
help
i
rode
and
rode
i
was
tryin
to
find
some
outfit
when
billy
lagged
i
beat
him
on
you
see
i
was
thinking
of
sam
after
a
while
the
horse
staggered
stepped
into
a
badger
hole
i
thought
but
he
kept
staggerin
i
fell
off
on
one
side
just
as
he
pitched
forward
he
tried
and
tried
to
get
up
i
stayed
till
he
died
then
i
kept
walking
i
do
know
what
became
of
sam
i
do
know
what
became
of
me
but
i
do
know
i
am
going
to
dig
wells
all
over
this
desert
until
every
thirsty
horse
can
have
water
all
the
time
he
had
been
eating
just
pickles
when
he
finished
his
story
he
ate
faster
by
now
we
all
knew
he
was
demented
the
men
tried
to
coax
him
to
go
on
with
us
so
that
they
could
turn
him
over
to
the
authorities
but
he
said
he
must
be
digging
at
last
it
was
decided
to
send
some
one
back
for
him
struble
was
unwilling
to
leave
him
but
the
man
would
not
be
persuaded
suddenly
he
gathered
up
his
smoking
and
some
food
and
ran
back
up
the
draw
we
had
to
go
on
of
course
all
that
afternoon
our
road
lay
along
the
buried
river
i
do
mean
dry
river
sand
had
blown
into
the
river
until
the
water
was
buried
water
was
only
a
few
feet
down
and
the
banks
were
clearly
defined
sometimes
we
came
to
a
small
dirty
puddle
but
it
was
so
alkaline
that
nothing
could
drink
it
the
story
we
had
heard
had
saddened
us
all
and
we
were
sorry
for
our
horses
poor
little
elizabeth
hull
wept
she
said
the
west
was
so
big
and
bare
and
she
was
so
alone
and
so
sad
she
just
to
cry
about
sundown
we
came
to
a
ranch
and
were
made
welcome
by
one
timothy
hobbs
owner
of
the
place
the
dwelling
and
the
stables
were
a
collection
of
low
brown
houses
made
of
logs
and
daubed
with
mud
fields
of
shocked
grain
made
a
very
background
a
belled
cow
led
a
bunch
of
sleek
cattle
home
over
the
sand
dunes
a
well
in
the
yard
afforded
plenty
of
clear
cold
water
which
was
raised
by
a
windmill
the
cattle
came
and
drank
at
the
trough
the
bell
making
a
pleasant
sound
in
the
twilight
the
men
told
hobbs
about
the
man
we
saw
oh
yes
he
said
that
is
crazy
olaf
he
has
been
that
way
for
twenty
years
spends
his
time
digging
wells
but
he
never
gets
any
water
and
the
sand
caves
in
almost
as
fast
as
he
can
get
it
out
then
he
launched
upon
a
recital
of
how
he
got
sweet
water
by
piping
past
the
alkali
strata
i
kept
hoping
he
would
tell
how
olaf
was
kept
and
who
was
responsible
for
him
but
he
never
told
he
invited
us
to
prepare
our
supper
in
his
kitchen
and
as
it
was
late
and
wood
was
scarce
we
were
glad
to
accept
he
bustled
about
helping
us
adding
such
dainties
as
fresh
milk
butter
and
eggs
to
our
menu
he
is
a
rather
stout
little
man
with
merry
gray
eyes
and
brown
hair
beginning
to
gray
he
wore
a
red
shirt
and
blue
overalls
and
he
wiped
his
butcher
knife
impartially
on
the
legs
of
his
overalls
or
his
towel
just
whichever
was
handiest
as
he
hurried
about
cutting
our
bacon
and
opening
cans
for
us
and
he
got
on
famously
after
supper
while
she
and
elizabeth
washed
the
dishes
she
asked
him
why
he
did
get
married
and
have
some
one
to
look
after
him
and
his
cabin
i
do
have
time
he
answered
i
came
west
eighteen
years
ago
to
make
a
start
and
a
home
for
jennie
and
me
but
i
ca
find
time
to
go
back
and
get
her
in
the
summer
i
have
to
hustle
to
make
the
hay
and
grain
and
i
have
to
stay
and
feed
the
stock
all
the
rest
of
the
time
you
write
her
once
in
a
while
do
you
asked
yes
he
said
i
wrote
her
two
years
ago
come
april
then
i
was
so
busy
i
did
go
to
town
till
i
went
for
my
year
supplies
i
went
to
the
post
office
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
letter
for
me
been
waitin
for
me
for
six
months
you
see
the
postmaster
knows
me
and
never
would
send
a
letter
back
i
set
down
there
right
in
the
office
and
answered
it
i
told
her
how
it
was
told
her
i
was
coming
after
her
soon
as
i
could
find
time
you
see
she
refuses
to
come
to
me
i
am
so
far
from
the
railroad
and
she
is
afraid
of
indians
and
wild
animals
have
you
got
your
answer
asked
elizabeth
no
he
said
i
ai
had
time
yet
to
go
but
i
kind
of
wish
somebody
would
think
to
bring
the
mail
not
many
people
pass
here
only
when
the
open
season
takes
hunters
to
the
mountains
when
you
people
come
back
will
you
stop
and
ask
for
the
mail
for
me
we
promised
in
the
purple
and
amber
light
of
a
new
day
we
were
about
and
soon
were
on
the
road
by
nightfall
we
had
bidden
the
desert
a
glad
farewell
and
had
camped
on
a
large
stream
among
trees
how
glad
we
were
to
see
so
much
water
and
such
big
cottonwoods
and
burney
were
within
a
day
drive
of
home
so
they
left
us
this
camp
is
at
newfork
and
our
party
has
four
new
members
a
doctor
a
man
and
two
geological
fellows
they
have
gone
on
but
we
will
join
them
soon
just
across
the
creek
from
us
is
the
cabin
of
a
new
settler
and
i
slept
together
last
night
only
we
could
sleep
for
the
continual
whining
cry
of
a
sick
baby
at
the
cabin
so
after
a
while
we
rose
and
dressed
and
crossed
over
to
see
if
we
could
be
of
any
help
we
found
a
woefully
distressed
young
couple
their
first
child
about
a
year
old
was
very
sick
they
did
know
what
to
do
for
it
and
she
was
afraid
to
stay
alone
while
he
went
for
help
they
were
powerfully
glad
to
see
us
and
the
young
father
left
at
once
to
get
grandma
mortimer
a
neighborhood
godsend
such
as
most
western
communities
have
one
of
we
busied
ourselves
relieving
the
young
mother
as
much
as
we
could
she
would
leave
the
baby
and
lie
down
the
child
is
teething
and
had
convulsions
we
put
it
into
a
hot
bath
and
held
the
convulsions
in
check
until
mortimer
came
she
bustled
in
and
took
hold
in
a
way
to
insure
confidence
she
had
not
been
there
long
before
she
had
both
parents
in
bed
saving
themselves
for
and
was
gently
rubbing
the
hot
little
body
of
the
baby
she
kept
giving
it
warm
tea
she
had
made
of
herbs
until
soon
the
threatening
jerks
were
over
the
peevish
whining
ceased
and
the
child
slept
peacefully
on
grandma
lap
i
watched
her
fascinated
there
was
never
a
bit
of
faltering
no
indecision
everything
she
did
seemed
exactly
what
she
ought
to
do
how
did
you
learn
it
all
i
asked
her
how
can
you
know
just
what
to
do
and
then
have
the
courage
to
do
it
i
should
be
afraid
of
doing
the
wrong
thing
why
she
said
that
is
easy
just
do
the
very
best
you
can
and
trust
god
for
the
rest
after
all
it
is
god
who
saves
the
baby
not
us
and
not
our
efforts
but
we
can
help
he
lets
us
do
that
lots
of
times
the
good
we
do
goes
beyond
any
medicine
never
be
afraid
to
your
best
i
have
been
doing
that
for
forty
years
and
i
am
going
to
keep
it
up
till
i
die
then
she
told
us
story
after
story
told
us
how
her
different
ambitions
had
boosted
her
along
had
made
her
swim
when
she
just
wanted
to
float
i
was
married
when
i
was
sixteen
and
of
course
my
first
ambition
was
to
own
a
home
for
dave
my
man
was
poor
he
had
a
horse
and
his
folks
gave
him
another
my
father
gave
me
a
heifer
and
mother
fitted
me
out
with
a
bed
that
was
counted
a
pretty
good
start
then
but
we
would
have
married
even
if
we
had
had
one
thing
being
young
we
were
we
both
took
to
work
like
a
duck
to
water
some
years
it
looked
as
if
we
were
going
to
see
every
dream
come
true
another
time
and
we
would
be
poorer
than
at
first
one
year
the
hail
destroyed
everything
another
time
the
flood
carried
away
all
we
had
when
little
dave
was
eleven
years
old
he
had
learned
to
plough
every
one
of
us
was
working
to
our
limit
that
year
i
ploughed
and
hoed
both
and
big
dave
really
hardly
took
time
to
sleep
you
see
his
idea
was
that
we
must
do
better
by
our
children
than
we
had
been
done
by
and
fanny
our
eldest
was
thirteen
big
dave
thought
all
girls
married
at
sixteen
because
his
mother
did
and
so
did
i
so
that
spring
he
said
just
three
years
fanny
will
be
leaving
us
and
we
do
right
by
her
i
wanted
powerfully
bad
that
should
have
a
blue
silk
wedding
dress
mother
but
of
course
it
could
be
had
and
you
looked
as
pretty
as
a
rose
in
your
pink
lawn
but
i
always
wanted
you
to
have
a
blue
silk
as
you
ca
have
it
let
us
get
it
for
fanny
and
of
course
we
must
have
everything
else
according
and
so
we
worked
mighty
hard
little
dave
begged
to
be
allowed
to
plough
every
other
boy
in
the
neighborhood
did
some
of
them
younger
than
he
but
somehow
i
want
him
to
one
of
our
neighbors
had
been
sick
a
lot
that
year
and
his
crops
were
about
ruined
it
was
time
and
we
had
finished
laying
by
our
crops
all
but
about
half
a
day
ploughing
in
the
corn
that
morning
at
breakfast
big
dave
said
he
would
take
the
horses
and
go
over
to
henry
boles
and
plough
that
day
to
help
out
said
he
could
finish
ours
any
time
and
it
did
matter
much
if
it
did
get
ploughed
he
told
the
children
to
lay
off
that
day
and
go
fishing
and
berrying
so
he
went
to
harness
his
team
and
little
dave
went
to
help
him
fanny
and
i
went
to
milk
and
all
the
time
i
could
hear
little
dave
begging
his
father
to
let
him
finish
the
ploughing
his
father
said
he
could
if
i
said
so
i
will
never
forget
his
eager
little
face
as
he
began
on
me
he
had
a
heap
of
freckles
i
remember
noticing
them
that
morning
he
was
barefooted
and
i
remember
that
one
toe
was
skinned
big
dave
was
lighting
his
pipe
and
till
i
remember
how
he
looked
as
he
held
the
match
to
his
pipe
drew
a
puff
of
smoke
and
said
yes
mother
so
i
said
yes
and
little
dave
ran
to
open
the
gate
for
his
father
as
big
dave
rode
through
the
gate
our
boy
caught
him
by
the
leg
and
said
just
you
daddy
big
dave
bent
down
and
kissed
him
and
said
a
son
how
proud
that
made
the
little
fellow
parents
should
praise
their
children
more
the
little
things
work
hard
for
a
few
words
of
praise
and
many
of
them
never
get
their
pay
well
the
little
fellow
would
have
no
help
to
harness
his
mule
so
fanny
and
i
went
to
the
house
and
fanny
said
ought
to
cook
an
extra
good
dinner
to
celebrate
davie
first
ploughing
i
go
down
in
the
pasture
and
gather
some
blackberries
if
you
will
make
a
cobbler
she
was
gone
all
morning
about
ten
i
took
a
pail
of
fresh
water
down
to
the
field
i
knew
davie
would
be
thirsty
and
i
was
uneasy
about
him
but
he
was
all
right
he
pushed
his
ragged
old
hat
back
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
just
as
his
father
would
have
done
i
petted
him
a
little
but
he
was
so
mannish
he
did
want
me
to
pet
him
any
more
after
he
drank
he
took
up
his
lines
again
and
said
watch
me
mother
see
how
i
can
plough
i
told
him
that
we
were
going
to
have
chicken
and
dumplings
for
dinner
and
that
he
must
sit
in
his
father
place
and
help
us
to
as
he
had
only
a
few
more
rows
to
plough
i
went
back
telling
myself
how
foolish
i
had
been
to
be
afraid
twelve
came
but
not
davie
i
sent
fanny
to
the
spring
for
the
buttermilk
and
waited
a
while
thinking
little
dave
had
not
finished
as
soon
as
he
had
expected
i
went
to
the
field
little
dave
lay
on
his
face
in
the
furrow
i
gathered
him
up
in
my
arms
he
was
yet
alive
he
put
one
weak
little
arm
around
my
neck
and
said
mammy
i
hurt
the
mule
kicked
me
in
the
stomach
i
do
know
how
i
got
to
the
house
with
him
i
stumbled
over
clods
and
weeds
through
the
hot
sunshine
i
sank
down
on
the
porch
in
the
shade
with
the
precious
little
form
clasped
tightly
to
me
he
smiled
and
tried
to
speak
but
the
blood
gurgled
up
into
his
throat
and
my
little
boy
was
gone
i
would
have
died
of
grief
if
i
had
had
to
work
so
hard
big
dave
got
too
warm
at
work
that
day
and
when
fanny
went
for
him
and
told
him
about
little
dave
he
ran
all
the
way
home
he
was
crazy
with
grief
and
forgot
the
horses
the
trouble
and
the
heat
and
the
overwork
brought
on
a
fever
i
had
no
time
for
tears
for
three
months
and
by
that
time
my
heart
was
hardened
against
my
maker
i
got
deeper
in
the
rut
of
work
but
i
had
given
up
my
ambition
for
a
home
of
my
own
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
work
so
hard
that
i
could
not
think
of
the
little
grave
on
which
the
leaves
were
falling
i
wanted
too
to
save
enough
money
to
mark
the
precious
spot
and
then
i
wanted
to
leave
but
first
one
thing
and
then
another
took
every
dollar
we
made
for
three
years
one
morning
big
dave
looked
so
worn
out
and
pale
that
i
said
am
going
to
get
out
of
here
i
am
not
going
to
stay
here
and
bury
dave
sunrise
will
see
us
on
the
road
west
we
have
worked
for
eighteen
years
as
hard
as
we
knew
how
and
have
given
up
my
boy
besides
and
now
we
ca
even
afford
to
mark
his
grave
decently
it
is
time
we
left
big
dave
went
back
to
bed
and
i
went
out
and
sold
what
we
had
it
was
so
little
that
it
did
take
long
to
sell
it
that
was
years
ago
we
came
west
the
country
was
really
wild
then
there
was
a
great
deal
of
lawlessness
we
did
get
settled
down
for
several
years
we
hired
to
a
man
who
had
a
contract
to
put
up
hay
for
the
government
and
we
worked
for
him
for
a
long
time
indians
were
thick
as
fleas
on
a
dog
then
some
were
camped
near
us
once
and
among
them
was
a
mexican
woman
who
could
jabber
a
little
english
once
when
i
was
feeling
particularly
resentful
and
sorrowful
i
told
her
about
my
little
dave
and
it
was
her
jabbered
words
that
showed
me
the
way
to
peace
i
wept
for
hours
but
peace
had
come
and
has
stayed
ambition
came
again
but
a
different
kind
i
wanted
the
same
peace
to
come
to
all
hearts
that
came
so
late
to
mine
and
i
wanted
to
help
bring
it
i
took
the
only
course
i
knew
i
have
gone
to
others
help
every
time
there
has
been
a
chance
after
fanny
married
and
dave
died
i
had
an
ambition
to
save
up
four
hundred
dollars
with
which
to
buy
an
entrance
into
an
old
ladies
home
just
before
i
got
the
full
amount
saved
up
i
found
that
young
eddie
carwell
wanted
to
enter
the
ministry
and
needed
help
to
go
to
college
i
had
just
enough
so
i
gave
it
to
him
another
time
i
had
almost
enough
when
charlie
rucker
got
into
trouble
over
some
mortgage
business
so
i
used
what
i
had
that
time
to
help
him
now
i
given
up
the
old
ladies
home
idea
and
am
saving
up
for
the
blue
silk
dress
dave
would
have
liked
me
to
have
i
guess
i
die
some
day
and
i
want
it
to
be
buried
in
i
like
to
think
i
going
to
my
two
daves
then
and
it
wo
be
hard
especially
if
i
have
the
blue
silk
on
just
then
a
sleepy
little
bird
twittered
outside
and
the
baby
stirred
a
little
the
first
faint
light
of
dawn
was
just
creeping
up
the
valley
i
rose
and
said
i
must
get
back
to
camp
and
i
had
both
wept
with
mortimer
over
little
dave
we
have
all
given
up
our
little
so
we
felt
near
each
other
we
told
mortimer
that
we
had
passed
under
the
rod
also
i
kissed
her
toilworn
old
hands
and
dropped
a
kiss
on
her
old
gray
head
as
we
passed
out
into
the
morning
we
felt
that
we
were
leaving
a
sanctified
presence
and
we
are
both
of
us
better
and
humbler
women
because
we
met
a
woman
who
has
buried
her
sorrow
beneath
faith
and
endeavor
this
does
seem
much
like
a
letter
does
it
when
i
started
on
this
trip
i
resolved
that
you
should
have
just
as
much
of
the
trip
as
i
could
give
you
i
did
know
we
would
be
so
long
getting
to
the
and
i
felt
you
would
to
know
of
the
people
we
meet
perhaps
my
next
letter
will
not
be
so
tame
the
hunting
season
opens
but
we
are
several
days
travel
from
the
elk
yet
elizabeth
behaves
queerly
she
does
want
to
go
on
stay
here
or
go
back
i
am
perfectly
mystified
so
far
she
has
not
told
us
a
thing
and
we
do
know
to
whom
she
is
going
or
anything
about
it
she
is
a
likable
little
lady
and
i
sincerely
hope
she
knows
what
she
is
doing
it
is
bedtime
and
i
must
stop
writing
we
go
on
with
affectionate
regards
elinore
rupert
stewart
v
danyul
and
his
mother
in
camp
on
the
gros
ventre
september
my
dear
friend
i
have
neglected
you
for
almost
a
week
but
when
you
read
this
letter
and
learn
why
i
feel
sure
you
will
forgive
me
to
begin
with
we
bade
mortimer
and
started
out
to
find
better
fishing
than
the
pretty
little
stream
we
were
on
afforded
us
our
way
lay
up
green
river
and
we
were
getting
nearer
our
final
all
the
time
but
we
were
in
no
hurry
to
begin
hunting
so
we
were
just
loitering
along
there
were
a
great
many
little
lakes
along
the
valley
and
thousands
of
duck
stewart
was
driving
but
as
he
wanted
to
shoot
ducks
i
took
the
lines
and
drove
along
there
is
so
much
that
is
beautiful
and
i
was
trying
so
hard
to
see
it
all
that
i
took
the
wrong
road
but
none
of
us
noticed
it
at
first
and
then
we
did
think
it
worth
while
to
turn
back
the
road
we
were
on
had
lain
along
the
foothills
but
when
i
first
thought
i
had
missed
the
right
road
we
were
coming
down
into
a
grassy
valley
stewart
came
across
a
marshy
stretch
of
meadow
and
climbed
up
on
the
wagon
the
ground
was
more
level
and
on
every
side
were
marshes
and
pools
the
willows
grew
higher
here
so
that
we
see
far
ahead
was
behind
and
she
called
out
say
i
believe
we
are
off
the
road
elizabeth
said
she
had
noticed
a
road
winding
off
on
our
right
so
we
agreed
that
i
must
have
taken
the
wrong
one
but
as
we
could
turn
in
the
willows
we
had
to
go
on
soon
we
reached
higher
drier
ground
and
passed
through
a
yellow
grove
of
quaking
asp
a
man
came
along
with
an
axe
on
his
shoulder
and
stewart
asked
him
about
the
road
yes
he
said
you
are
off
the
main
road
but
on
a
better
you
cross
the
same
stream
you
were
going
to
camp
on
right
at
my
ranch
it
is
just
a
little
way
across
here
and
it
almost
sundown
so
i
will
show
you
the
way
he
strode
along
ahead
we
drove
through
an
avenue
of
great
dark
pines
and
across
a
log
bridge
that
spanned
a
noisy
brawling
stream
the
man
opened
a
set
of
bars
and
we
drove
into
a
big
clean
corral
comfortable
sheds
and
stables
lined
one
side
and
big
stacks
of
hay
were
conveniently
placed
he
began
to
help
unharness
the
teams
saying
that
they
might
just
as
well
run
in
his
meadow
as
he
was
through
haying
then
the
horses
would
be
safe
while
we
fished
he
insisted
on
our
stopping
in
his
cabin
which
we
found
to
be
a
comfortable
affair
with
a
veranda
the
whole
length
the
pines
overshadowed
the
house
just
behind
it
was
a
garden
in
which
some
late
vegetables
were
still
growing
the
air
was
rather
frosty
and
some
worried
hens
were
trying
hard
to
cover
some
chirping
chicks
it
was
such
a
homey
place
that
we
felt
welcome
and
perfectly
comfortable
at
once
the
inside
of
the
house
will
not
be
hard
to
describe
it
was
clean
as
could
be
but
with
a
typical
cleanliness
there
was
no
dirt
but
a
great
deal
of
disorder
across
the
head
of
the
iron
bed
was
hung
a
miscellany
of
socks
neckties
and
suspenders
a
discouraging
assortment
of
boots
shoes
and
leggings
protruded
from
beneath
the
bed
some
calendars
ornamented
the
wall
and
upon
a
table
stood
a
smoky
lamp
and
some
tobacco
and
a
smelly
pipe
on
a
rack
over
the
door
lay
a
rifle
pretty
soon
our
host
came
bustling
in
and
exclaimed
the
kitchen
is
more
pleasant
than
this
room
and
there
a
fire
there
too
then
catching
sight
of
his
lamp
he
picked
it
up
hurriedly
and
said
jest
as
shore
as
i
leave
anything
undone
that
shore
somebody
comes
and
sees
how
slouchy
i
am
come
on
into
the
kitchen
where
you
can
warm
and
i
clean
this
lamp
one
of
the
cows
was
sick
this
morning
i
hurried
over
things
so
as
to
doctor
her
and
i
forgot
the
lamp
i
smoke
and
the
lamp
smokes
to
keep
me
company
the
kitchen
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
any
one
two
great
windows
one
in
the
east
and
one
in
the
south
gave
plenty
of
sunlight
a
shining
new
range
and
a
fine
assortment
of
vessels
which
were
not
all
yet
in
their
place
were
in
one
corner
there
was
a
slow
ticking
clock
up
on
a
high
shelf
near
the
door
stood
a
homemade
with
a
tin
basin
and
above
it
hung
a
long
narrow
mirror
on
the
back
of
the
door
was
a
the
floor
was
made
of
white
pine
and
was
spotlessly
clean
in
the
center
of
the
room
stood
the
table
with
a
cover
of
red
oilcloth
some
chairs
were
placed
about
the
table
but
our
host
quickly
hauled
them
out
for
us
he
opened
his
storeroom
and
told
us
to
dish
in
and
help
ourselves
to
anything
we
wanted
because
we
were
to
be
his
somebody
come
for
that
night
then
he
hurried
out
to
help
with
the
teams
again
he
was
so
friendly
and
so
likeable
that
we
did
feel
a
bit
backward
about
dishin
in
and
it
was
not
long
before
we
had
a
smoking
supper
on
the
table
while
we
were
at
supper
he
said
i
wonder
now
if
any
of
you
women
can
make
aprons
and
bonnets
i
do
mean
them
dinky
little
things
like
they
make
now
but
rale
wearin
things
like
they
used
to
make
i
was
afraid
of
another
advertisement
romance
and
did
reply
but
said
indade
we
can
none
better
then
he
answered
i
want
a
blue
chambray
bonnet
and
a
bunch
of
aprons
made
for
my
mother
she
is
on
the
way
here
from
pennsylvania
i
seen
her
for
fifteen
years
i
left
home
longer
that
ago
but
i
remember
everything
just
how
everything
looked
and
i
like
to
have
things
inside
the
house
as
nearly
like
home
as
i
can
anyway
i
did
know
how
long
we
could
stop
there
so
i
still
made
no
promises
but
could
easily
answer
every
question
for
a
dozen
women
have
you
the
cloth
she
asked
yes
he
said
he
had
had
it
for
a
long
time
but
he
had
not
had
it
sewn
because
he
had
not
been
sure
mother
come
what
your
name
asked
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
said
daniel
holt
i
wondered
why
he
hesitated
but
forgot
all
about
it
when
clyde
said
we
would
stop
there
for
a
few
days
if
we
wanted
to
help
holt
mind
was
already
made
up
elizabeth
said
she
would
be
glad
to
help
and
i
was
not
long
in
deciding
when
daniel
said
i
take
it
as
a
rale
friendly
favor
if
you
women
could
help
because
mother
ai
had
what
could
rightly
be
called
a
home
since
i
left
home
she
crippled
too
and
i
want
to
do
all
i
can
i
know
she
just
like
to
have
some
aprons
and
a
sunbonnet
his
eyes
had
such
a
pathetic
appealing
look
that
i
was
ashamed
and
we
at
once
began
planning
our
work
daniel
helped
with
the
dishes
and
as
soon
as
they
were
done
brought
out
his
cloth
he
had
a
heap
of
it
a
bolt
of
checked
gingham
enough
blue
chambray
for
half
a
dozen
bonnets
and
a
great
many
remnants
which
he
said
he
had
bought
from
peddlers
from
time
to
time
selected
what
she
said
we
would
begin
on
and
dampened
it
so
as
to
shrink
it
by
morning
we
then
spread
our
beds
and
made
ready
for
an
early
start
next
day
next
morning
we
ate
breakfast
by
the
light
of
the
lamp
that
smoked
for
the
sake
of
companionship
and
then
started
to
cut
out
our
work
daniel
and
stewart
went
fishing
and
we
packed
their
lunch
so
as
to
have
them
out
of
the
way
all
day
i
undertook
the
making
of
the
bonnet
because
i
knew
how
and
because
i
can
remember
the
kind
my
mother
wore
i
reckoned
daniel
mother
would
have
worn
about
the
same
style
and
elizabeth
can
both
so
they
went
out
to
daniel
granary
and
ripped
up
some
in
order
to
get
the
thread
with
which
they
were
sewed
to
work
one
apron
in
but
when
we
were
ready
to
sew
we
were
dismayed
for
there
was
no
machine
however
was
of
the
opinion
that
in
the
country
must
have
a
sewing
machine
so
she
saddled
a
horse
and
went
out
she
said
to
beat
the
brush
she
was
hardly
out
of
sight
before
a
man
rode
up
and
said
there
had
been
a
telephone
message
saying
that
holt
had
arrived
in
rock
springs
and
was
on
her
way
as
far
as
newfork
in
an
automobile
that
threw
elizabeth
and
myself
into
a
panic
we
posted
the
messenger
off
on
a
hunt
for
daniel
elizabeth
soon
got
over
her
flurry
and
went
at
her
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
but
acting
from
force
of
habit
i
reckon
i
began
cleaning
a
powerfully
good
way
to
reason
out
things
sometimes
is
to
work
and
just
then
i
had
to
work
i
began
on
the
storeroom
which
was
well
lighted
and
which
was
also
used
as
a
pantry
as
soon
as
i
began
straightening
up
i
began
to
wonder
where
the
mother
would
sleep
by
arranging
things
in
the
storeroom
a
little
differently
i
was
able
to
make
room
for
a
bed
and
a
trunk
i
decided
on
putting
daniel
there
so
then
i
began
work
in
earnest
elizabeth
laid
down
her
work
and
helped
me
we
tacked
white
cheesecloth
over
the
wall
and
although
the
floor
was
clean
we
scrubbed
it
to
freshen
it
we
polished
the
window
until
it
sparkled
we
were
right
in
the
middle
of
our
work
when
came
and
daniel
with
her
they
were
all
excitement
but
is
a
real
general
and
soon
marshaled
her
forces
daniel
had
to
go
to
newfork
after
his
mother
that
would
take
three
days
pointed
out
to
him
the
need
of
a
few
pieces
of
furniture
so
he
took
a
wagon
and
team
which
he
got
a
neighbor
to
drive
while
he
took
another
team
and
a
buggy
for
his
mother
newfork
is
a
day
drive
beyond
pinedale
and
the
necessary
furniture
could
be
had
in
pinedale
so
the
neighbor
went
along
and
brought
back
a
new
bed
a
rocker
and
some
rugs
but
of
course
he
had
to
stay
overnight
i
was
for
keeping
right
on
but
as
had
arranged
for
us
all
to
come
and
sew
that
afternoon
at
a
house
we
took
our
sewing
and
clambered
into
the
buckboard
and
set
out
we
found
bonham
a
pleasant
little
woman
whose
husband
had
earned
her
pretty
new
machine
by
chewing
tobacco
i
reckon
you
think
that
is
a
mighty
funny
method
of
earning
anything
but
some
tobacco
has
tags
which
are
redeemable
and
the
machine
was
one
of
the
premiums
bonham
just
beamed
with
pride
as
she
rolled
out
her
machine
i
never
had
a
machine
before
she
explained
i
just
went
to
the
when
i
had
to
sew
so
of
course
i
wanted
a
machine
awfully
bad
so
frank
jest
chawed
and
chawed
and
i
saved
every
tag
till
we
got
enough
and
last
year
we
got
the
machine
frank
is
chawin
out
a
clock
now
but
that
wo
take
him
so
long
as
the
machine
did
well
the
machine
did
splendidly
and
we
turned
out
some
good
work
that
afternoon
i
completed
the
blue
bonnet
which
was
to
be
used
as
best
and
made
a
splint
bonnet
and
elizabeth
did
well
on
their
aprons
we
took
turns
about
at
the
machine
and
not
a
minute
was
wasted
bonham
showed
us
some
crochet
lace
which
she
said
she
hoped
to
sell
and
right
at
once
fertile
mind
begin
to
hatch
plans
she
would
make
holt
a
sunday
apron
she
said
and
she
bought
the
lace
to
trim
it
with
i
thought
holt
must
be
an
lady
who
liked
bonham
had
a
pretty
pair
she
was
willing
to
sell
on
one
was
worked
good
morning
on
the
other
good
night
it
was
done
with
red
cotton
the
shams
had
a
dainty
edge
of
homemade
lace
elizabeth
would
not
be
outdone
she
purchased
a
star
quilt
pieced
in
red
and
white
at
sundown
we
went
home
we
were
all
tired
but
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
we
went
to
work
again
we
took
down
the
bed
and
set
it
up
in
dan
new
quarters
and
we
made
such
headway
on
what
had
been
his
bedroom
that
we
knew
we
could
finish
in
a
little
while
next
day
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
we
had
breakfasted
and
elizabeth
went
back
to
sew
taking
with
them
a
lot
of
white
cheesecloth
for
lining
for
the
bedroom
we
were
preparing
for
holt
stewart
had
had
fine
luck
fishing
but
he
said
he
felt
plumb
left
out
with
so
much
bustling
about
and
he
not
helping
he
is
very
handy
with
a
saw
and
hammer
and
he
contrived
what
we
called
a
chist
of
drawers
for
daniel
room
the
chist
had
only
one
drawer
into
that
we
put
all
the
gloves
ties
handkerchiefs
and
suspenders
and
on
the
shelves
below
we
put
his
shoes
and
boots
then
i
made
a
blue
curtain
for
the
chist
and
one
for
the
window
and
the
room
looked
plumb
nice
i
can
tell
you
i
liked
the
chist
so
well
that
i
asked
stewart
to
make
something
of
the
kind
for
holt
room
he
said
there
would
be
time
but
he
went
to
work
on
it
promptly
at
noon
and
elizabeth
came
with
the
lining
for
the
room
we
worked
like
beavers
and
had
the
room
sweet
and
ready
by
when
the
man
came
from
pinedale
with
the
new
furniture
in
just
a
little
while
we
had
the
room
in
perfect
order
the
bed
nicely
made
with
soft
new
blankets
for
sheets
the
pretty
star
quilt
on
and
the
nice
clean
pillows
protected
by
the
shams
they
could
buy
no
rugs
but
a
weaver
of
rag
carpets
in
pinedale
had
some
pieces
of
carpet
which
daniel
sent
back
to
us
they
were
really
better
and
greatly
more
in
keeping
we
were
very
proud
of
the
pretty
white
and
red
room
when
we
were
through
only
the
kitchen
was
left
but
we
decided
we
could
clean
that
early
next
day
so
we
sat
down
to
sew
and
to
plan
the
next
day
dinner
we
could
hear
stewart
out
in
the
barn
hammering
and
sawing
on
the
chist
while
we
were
debating
whether
to
have
fried
chicken
or
trout
for
dinner
two
little
girls
both
on
one
horse
rode
up
they
entered
shyly
and
after
carefully
explaining
to
us
that
they
had
heard
that
a
of
women
were
buying
everything
they
could
see
had
run
holt
off
and
were
living
in
his
house
they
told
us
they
had
come
to
sell
us
some
blueing
when
they
got
two
dollars
worth
sold
the
blueing
company
would
send
them
a
big
doll
so
please
would
we
buy
a
lot
we
did
think
we
could
use
any
blueing
but
we
hated
to
disappoint
the
little
things
we
talked
along
and
presently
they
told
us
of
their
mother
flowers
daniel
had
told
us
his
mother
had
a
red
flower
in
her
kitchen
window
when
the
little
girls
assured
us
their
mother
had
a
red
geranium
in
bloom
set
out
to
get
it
and
about
dark
she
returned
with
a
beautiful
plant
just
beginning
to
bloom
we
were
all
as
happy
as
children
we
had
all
worked
very
hard
too
stewart
said
we
deserved
no
sympathy
because
we
cleaned
a
perfectly
clean
house
but
anyway
we
felt
much
better
for
having
gone
over
it
the
chist
was
finished
early
next
morning
it
would
have
looked
better
perhaps
if
it
had
had
a
little
paint
but
as
we
had
no
paint
and
were
short
of
time
we
persuaded
ourselves
it
looked
beautiful
with
only
its
clean
pretty
curtain
we
did
make
many
changes
in
the
kitchen
all
we
did
was
to
take
down
the
mirror
and
turn
it
lengthways
above
the
over
the
fireplace
we
put
the
new
rocker
in
the
bright
sunny
corner
where
it
would
be
easier
for
dim
old
eyes
to
see
to
read
or
sew
we
set
the
geranium
on
the
broad
clean
sill
of
the
window
and
i
think
you
would
have
agreed
with
us
that
it
was
a
cozy
cheerful
home
to
come
to
after
fifteen
years
of
lonely
homelessness
we
could
get
the
dinner
question
settled
so
we
dished
in
each
cooked
what
she
thought
best
like
samantha
ann
allen
we
had
everything
good
and
plenty
of
it
elizabeth
took
a
real
interest
and
worked
well
she
is
the
girl
and
would
be
a
precious
daughter
to
some
mother
she
has
not
yet
told
us
anything
about
herself
all
we
know
is
she
taught
school
somewhere
in
the
east
she
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
way
we
took
possession
of
a
stranger
home
but
she
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
we
it
is
so
nice
to
be
doing
something
for
some
one
again
something
real
homey
and
she
remarked
as
she
laid
the
table
for
dinner
we
had
dinner
almost
ready
when
we
heard
the
wheels
crossing
the
mossy
log
bridge
we
raced
to
let
down
the
bars
beside
daniel
sat
a
dear
dumpy
little
woman
her
head
very
much
bundled
up
with
a
lot
of
old
black
veils
daniel
drove
through
the
corral
into
the
yard
and
right
up
to
the
door
he
helped
her
out
gently
she
kept
admonishing
him
careful
danyul
careful
he
handed
out
her
crutch
and
helped
her
into
the
kitchen
where
she
sank
panting
into
the
rocker
it
is
my
leg
she
explained
it
has
been
that
way
ever
since
danyul
was
a
baby
then
she
pleaded
careful
careful
to
elizabeth
who
was
tenderly
unwrapping
her
i
would
have
anything
happen
to
this
brown
alapacky
for
anything
it
is
my
very
best
and
i
had
it
ever
since
before
i
went
to
the
pore
farm
but
i
wanted
to
look
nice
for
danyul
comin
to
his
home
for
the
first
time
an
all
we
had
the
happiest
dinner
party
i
ever
remember
it
would
be
powerfully
hard
for
me
to
say
which
was
happier
danyul
or
his
mother
they
just
beamed
upon
each
other
she
was
proud
of
her
boy
and
his
pleasant
home
danyul
says
he
got
a
little
red
heifer
for
me
and
he
got
ten
cows
of
his
own
now
ai
that
fine
it
is
a
pity
we
ca
have
a
few
apple
trees
a
little
orchard
we
live
like
kings
we
would
that
we
explained
to
her
how
we
got
our
fruit
by
parcel
post
and
danyul
said
he
would
order
his
winter
supply
of
apples
at
once
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
danyul
had
to
mend
a
fence
so
as
to
keep
his
cattle
in
their
own
pasture
stewart
went
to
help
and
we
women
were
left
alone
we
improved
the
time
well
holt
would
not
lie
down
and
rest
as
we
tried
to
persuade
her
to
but
hobbled
about
admiring
everything
she
was
delighted
with
the
big
clean
cellar
and
its
orderly
bins
in
which
danyul
was
beginning
to
store
his
vegetables
she
was
as
pleased
as
a
child
with
her
room
and
almost
wept
when
we
told
her
which
were
welcoming
presents
from
us
she
was
particularly
delighted
with
her
red
flower
and
will
be
happy
for
days
remembering
it
was
she
who
gave
it
i
shall
be
happy
longer
than
that
remembering
how
tickled
she
was
with
her
bonnets
she
wanted
to
wipe
the
dishes
so
she
and
i
did
up
the
dishes
while
and
elizabeth
put
some
finishing
stitches
in
on
their
aprons
she
sat
on
the
highest
seat
we
could
find
and
as
she
deftly
handled
the
dishes
she
told
us
this
i
should
think
you
would
wonder
why
danyul
ai
got
me
out
of
the
porehouse
before
now
i
been
there
more
ten
years
but
danyul
did
know
it
till
a
month
ago
charlotte
nash
wrote
him
neither
danyul
nor
me
are
any
at
writin
and
then
i
did
want
him
to
know
anyhow
when
danyul
got
into
trouble
i
signed
over
the
little
farm
his
pa
left
us
to
pay
the
lawyer
person
to
defend
him
danyul
had
enough
trouble
so
he
went
to
the
penitentiary
without
finding
out
i
was
homeless
i
should
think
you
would
be
put
out
to
know
danyul
has
been
to
the
pen
but
he
has
he
always
said
to
me
that
he
never
done
what
he
was
accused
of
so
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
what
it
was
danyul
was
always
a
good
boy
honest
and
good
to
me
and
a
hard
worker
i
ai
got
no
call
to
doubt
him
when
he
says
innocent
well
i
fought
his
case
the
best
i
could
but
he
got
ten
years
then
the
lawyer
person
claimed
the
home
an
all
so
i
went
out
to
work
but
bein
crippled
i
found
it
hard
when
danyul
had
been
gone
four
years
i
had
saved
enough
to
buy
my
brown
alapacky
and
go
to
see
him
he
looked
pale
and
sad
afraid
even
to
speak
to
his
own
mother
i
went
back
to
work
as
broke
up
as
danyul
and
that
winter
i
come
down
with
such
a
long
spell
of
sickness
that
they
sent
me
to
the
pore
farm
i
always
wrote
to
danyul
on
his
birthday
and
i
could
bear
to
let
him
know
where
i
was
soon
his
time
was
out
he
come
here
he
could
bear
the
scorn
that
he
get
at
home
so
he
come
out
to
this
big
free
west
and
took
the
chance
it
offers
once
he
wrote
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
live
west
he
said
if
i
did
after
he
got
a
start
i
must
sell
out
and
come
to
him
bless
his
heart
all
that
time
i
was
going
to
my
meals
just
when
i
was
told
to
and
eatin
just
what
i
was
helped
to
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
at
some
one
else
word
oh
it
was
bitter
but
i
did
want
danyul
to
taste
it
so
when
i
did
come
he
thought
i
did
want
to
give
up
the
old
home
and
did
say
no
more
about
it
charlotte
was
on
the
pore
farm
too
until
her
cousin
died
and
she
got
left
a
home
and
enough
to
live
on
sometimes
she
would
come
out
to
the
farm
and
take
me
back
with
her
for
a
little
visit
she
was
good
that
way
i
never
would
tell
her
about
danyul
but
this
summer
i
was
helpin
her
dry
apples
and
somehow
she
jist
coaxed
the
secret
out
she
wrote
to
danyul
and
he
wrote
to
me
and
here
i
am
danyul
and
me
are
so
happy
that
we
are
goin
to
send
a
ticket
back
to
the
farm
for
maggie
harper
she
ai
got
no
home
and
will
be
glad
to
help
me
and
get
a
rale
home
and
elizabeth
debated
what
more
was
needed
to
make
the
kitchen
a
bit
more
homey
said
a
red
cushion
for
the
rocker
and
elizabeth
said
a
white
cat
to
lie
on
the
hearth
holt
said
yes
i
need
both
only
it
must
be
an
old
stray
tabby
cat
this
house
is
going
to
be
the
shelter
of
the
homeless
well
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
about
the
holts
because
we
left
next
morning
danyul
came
across
the
bridge
to
bid
us
he
said
he
could
never
thank
us
enough
but
it
is
we
who
should
be
and
are
thankful
we
got
a
little
glow
of
happiness
from
their
great
blaze
we
are
all
so
glad
to
know
that
everything
is
secure
and
bright
for
the
holts
in
the
future
that
stop
is
the
cause
of
my
missing
two
letters
to
you
but
this
letter
is
as
long
as
half
a
dozen
letters
should
be
you
know
i
never
could
get
along
with
few
words
i
try
to
do
better
next
time
but
i
ca
imagine
how
i
shall
get
the
letters
mailed
we
are
miles
and
miles
and
miles
away
in
the
mountains
it
is
two
days
ride
to
a
so
maybe
i
will
not
get
letters
to
you
as
often
as
i
planned
sincerely
yours
elinore
rupert
stewart
vi
elizabeth
romance
camp
cloudcrest
september
dear
coney
i
find
i
ca
write
to
you
as
often
as
i
at
first
intended
but
a
chance
so
i
will
not
let
it
pass
unused
we
are
in
the
last
camp
right
on
the
hunting
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
fray
we
have
said
to
dear
elizabeth
and
i
must
tell
you
about
her
because
she
really
comes
first
to
begin
with
the
morning
we
left
the
holts
elizabeth
suggested
that
we
three
women
ride
in
the
buckboard
so
i
seated
myself
on
a
roll
of
bedding
in
the
back
part
at
first
none
of
us
talked
we
just
absorbed
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
morning
the
sky
was
clear
blue
with
a
few
fleecy
clouds
drifting
lazily
past
the
mountains
on
one
side
were
crested
great
crags
and
piles
of
rock
crowned
them
as
far
as
we
could
see
timber
grew
only
about
halfway
up
the
trunks
of
the
quaking
aspens
shone
silvery
in
the
early
sunlight
and
their
leaves
were
shimmering
gold
and
the
stately
pines
kept
whispering
and
murmuring
it
almost
seemed
as
if
they
were
chiding
the
quaking
aspens
for
being
frivolous
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
lay
the
river
bordered
by
willows
and
grassy
flats
there
were
many
small
lakes
and
the
ducks
and
geese
were
noisily
enjoying
themselves
among
the
rushes
and
beyond
the
river
rose
the
mountains
hill
upon
hill
elizabeth
dressed
with
especial
care
that
morning
and
very
pretty
she
looked
in
her
neat
shepherd
plaid
suit
and
natty
little
white
canvas
hat
very
soon
she
said
i
hope
neither
of
you
will
misunderstand
me
when
i
tell
you
that
if
my
hopes
are
realized
i
will
not
ride
with
you
much
longer
i
never
saw
such
a
country
as
the
west
it
is
so
big
and
so
beautiful
and
i
never
saw
such
people
you
are
just
like
your
country
you
have
fed
me
cared
for
me
and
befriended
me
a
stranger
and
never
asked
me
a
word
said
tut
tut
is
nothing
at
all
we
done
is
a
comfort
you
been
has
she
mrs
stewart
i
could
heartily
agree
and
elizabeth
went
on
the
way
i
have
been
received
and
the
way
we
all
treated
holt
will
be
the
greatest
help
to
me
in
becoming
what
i
hope
to
become
a
real
westerner
i
might
have
lived
a
long
time
in
the
west
and
not
have
understood
many
things
if
i
had
not
fallen
into
your
hands
years
ago
before
i
was
through
school
i
was
to
have
been
married
but
i
lost
my
mother
just
then
and
was
left
the
care
of
my
paralytic
father
if
i
had
married
then
i
should
have
had
to
take
father
from
his
familiar
surroundings
because
wallace
came
west
in
the
forestry
service
i
felt
that
it
would
be
right
poor
father
could
speak
but
his
eyes
told
me
how
grateful
he
was
to
stay
we
had
our
little
home
and
father
had
his
pension
and
i
was
able
to
get
a
small
school
near
us
i
could
take
care
of
father
and
teach
also
we
were
very
comfortably
situated
and
in
time
became
really
happy
although
i
seldom
heard
from
wallace
his
letters
were
well
worth
waiting
for
and
i
knew
he
was
doing
well
eighteen
months
ago
father
died
gently
went
to
sleep
i
waited
six
months
and
then
wrote
to
wallace
but
received
no
reply
i
have
written
him
three
times
and
have
had
no
word
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
have
come
to
see
what
has
become
of
him
if
he
is
dead
may
i
stay
on
with
one
of
you
and
perhaps
get
a
school
i
want
to
live
here
always
but
darlint
said
supposin
it
married
your
man
is
wallace
may
have
changed
his
mind
about
me
but
he
would
not
marry
without
telling
me
if
he
is
alive
he
is
honorable
then
i
asked
why
did
you
ask
about
him
at
pinedale
or
any
of
these
places
we
have
passed
if
he
is
stationed
in
the
bridges
reserve
they
would
be
sure
to
know
of
him
at
any
of
these
little
places
i
just
did
have
the
courage
to
i
should
never
have
told
you
what
i
have
only
i
think
i
owe
it
to
you
and
it
was
easier
because
of
the
holts
i
am
so
glad
we
met
them
so
we
drove
along
talking
together
we
each
assured
the
girl
of
our
entire
willingness
to
have
her
as
a
member
of
the
family
after
a
while
i
got
on
to
the
wagon
with
stewart
and
told
him
story
so
that
he
could
inquire
about
the
man
soon
we
came
to
the
crossing
on
green
river
just
beyond
the
ford
we
could
see
the
cabin
with
the
stars
and
stripes
fluttering
gayly
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
we
drove
into
the
roaring
dashing
water
and
we
held
our
breath
until
we
emerged
on
the
other
side
sorenson
is
a
very
capable
and
conscientious
and
a
very
genial
gentleman
he
rode
down
to
meet
us
to
inspect
our
license
and
to
tell
us
about
our
privileges
and
our
duties
as
good
woodsmen
he
also
issues
licenses
in
case
hunters
have
neglected
to
secure
them
before
coming
had
refused
to
get
a
license
when
we
did
she
said
she
was
not
going
to
hunt
she
told
us
we
could
give
her
a
small
piece
of
ilk
and
that
would
do
so
we
were
rather
surprised
when
she
purchased
two
licenses
one
a
special
which
would
entitle
her
to
a
bull
elk
as
we
were
starting
stewart
asked
the
can
you
tell
me
if
wallace
white
is
still
stationed
here
oh
yes
sorenson
said
wallace
place
is
only
a
few
miles
up
the
river
and
can
be
plainly
seen
from
the
road
we
drove
on
happiness
had
taken
a
new
clutch
upon
my
heart
i
looked
back
expecting
to
see
elizabeth
all
smiles
but
if
you
will
believe
me
the
foolish
girl
was
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
was
broken
drew
her
head
down
upon
her
shoulder
and
was
trying
to
quiet
her
the
road
along
there
was
rough
staying
on
the
wagon
occupied
all
my
attention
for
a
while
several
miles
were
passed
when
we
came
in
sight
of
a
beautiful
cabin
half
hidden
in
a
grove
of
pines
beyond
the
river
stewart
said
we
might
as
well
noon
as
soon
as
we
came
to
a
good
place
and
then
he
would
ride
across
and
see
white
just
as
we
rounded
the
hill
a
horseman
came
toward
us
a
splendid
fellow
he
was
manly
strength
and
grace
showing
in
every
line
the
road
was
narrow
against
the
hillside
and
he
had
to
ride
quite
close
so
i
saw
his
handsome
face
plainly
as
soon
as
he
saw
elizabeth
he
sprang
from
his
saddle
and
said
what
you
here
she
held
her
hands
to
him
and
said
oh
just
riding
with
friends
then
to
she
said
is
my
wallace
stewart
is
the
queerest
man
instead
of
letting
me
enjoy
the
tableau
he
solemnly
drove
on
saying
he
would
not
want
any
one
gawking
at
him
if
he
were
the
happy
man
anyway
he
could
urge
chub
fast
enough
to
prevent
my
seeing
and
hearing
what
i
told
you
besides
that
i
saw
that
elizabeth
hat
was
on
awry
her
hair
in
disorder
and
her
eyes
red
it
was
disappointing
after
she
had
been
so
careful
to
look
nicely
came
trotting
along
and
we
stopped
for
dinner
we
had
just
got
the
coffee
boiling
when
the
lovers
came
up
elizabeth
in
the
saddle
learning
to
ride
and
he
walking
beside
her
holding
her
hand
how
happy
they
were
the
rest
of
us
were
mighty
near
as
foolish
as
they
they
were
going
to
start
immediately
after
dinner
on
horseback
for
the
county
seat
to
be
married
after
we
had
eaten
elizabeth
selected
a
few
things
from
her
trunk
and
stewart
and
white
drove
the
buckboard
across
the
river
to
leave
the
trunk
in
its
new
home
while
they
were
gone
we
helped
elizabeth
to
dress
all
the
while
was
admonishing
her
to
name
her
first
girul
mary
ellen
or
she
said
if
yer
first
girul
happens
to
be
a
it
sheridan
ye
be
callin
him
which
was
me
name
before
i
was
married
to
me
man
god
rest
his
soul
dear
elizabeth
she
was
glad
to
get
away
i
suspect
she
and
her
wallace
made
a
fine
couple
as
they
rode
away
in
the
golden
september
afternoon
i
believe
she
is
happy
bride
that
the
sun
shone
on
if
the
omen
has
failed
else
well
we
felt
powerfully
reduced
in
numbers
but
about
three
that
afternoon
we
came
upon
struble
and
haynes
waiting
beside
the
road
for
us
they
had
come
to
pilot
us
into
camp
for
there
would
be
no
road
soon
such
a
way
as
we
came
over
such
jolting
and
sliding
i
begged
to
get
off
and
walk
but
as
the
whole
way
was
carpeted
by
strawberry
vines
and
there
were
late
berries
to
tempt
me
to
loiter
i
had
to
stay
on
the
wagon
i
had
no
idea
a
wagon
could
be
got
across
such
places
struble
drove
for
and
i
could
hear
her
imploring
all
the
saints
to
preserve
us
from
instant
death
i
kept
shutting
my
eyes
trying
not
to
see
the
terrifying
places
and
opening
them
again
to
see
the
beauty
spread
everywhere
until
stewart
said
it
must
make
you
nervous
to
ride
over
mountain
roads
do
bat
your
eyes
so
fast
and
you
see
more
so
then
i
stiffened
my
back
and
kept
my
eyes
open
and
i
see
more
it
had
been
decided
to
go
as
far
as
we
could
with
the
wagons
and
then
set
camp
from
there
the
hunters
would
ride
horseback
as
far
up
as
they
could
and
then
climb
it
was
almost
sundown
when
we
reached
camp
all
the
hunters
were
in
and
such
a
yowling
as
they
set
up
look
who
here
see
who
come
they
yelled
they
went
to
work
setting
up
tents
and
unloading
wagons
with
a
hearty
we
are
camped
just
on
the
edge
of
the
pines
back
of
us
rises
a
big
mountain
our
tents
are
set
under
some
big
trees
on
a
small
plateau
and
right
below
us
is
a
valley
in
which
grass
grows
knee
high
and
little
streams
come
from
every
way
trout
scurry
up
stream
whenever
we
go
near
we
call
the
valley
paradise
valley
because
it
is
the
horses
paradise
and
as
in
the
early
morning
we
can
often
see
clouds
rolling
along
the
valley
we
call
our
camp
cloudcrest
we
have
a
beautiful
place
it
is
well
sheltered
there
is
plenty
of
wood
water
and
feed
and
looking
eastward
down
the
valley
mountains
delight
the
eye
the
air
is
so
bracing
that
we
all
feel
equal
to
struble
has
already
killed
a
fine
spike
elk
for
camp
eating
we
camped
in
a
bunch
and
we
have
camp
stoves
so
that
in
case
of
rain
or
snow
we
can
stay
indoors
just
now
we
have
a
huge
camp
fire
around
which
we
sit
in
the
evening
telling
stories
singing
and
eating
nuts
of
the
pi√±on
pine
then
too
the
whole
country
is
filled
with
those
tiny
little
strawberries
we
have
to
gather
all
day
to
get
as
much
as
we
can
eat
but
they
are
delicious
yesterday
we
had
pie
made
of
wild
currants
there
are
a
powerful
lot
of
them
here
there
is
also
a
little
blueberry
that
the
men
say
is
the
rocky
mountain
huckleberry
the
grouse
are
feeding
on
them
altogether
this
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
places
imaginable
the
men
are
not
very
anxious
to
begin
hunting
a
little
delay
means
cooler
weather
for
the
meat
it
is
cool
up
here
but
going
back
across
the
desert
it
will
be
warm
for
a
while
yet
still
when
they
see
elk
every
day
it
is
a
great
temptation
to
try
a
shot
one
of
the
students
told
me
professor
glenholdt
was
here
to
get
the
bone
of
the
tail
of
a
brontosaurus
i
do
know
what
that
is
but
if
it
is
a
fossil
he
wo
get
it
for
the
soil
is
too
deep
the
students
are
jolly
likable
fellows
but
they
can
talk
of
nothing
but
strata
and
formation
i
heard
one
of
them
say
he
would
be
glad
when
some
one
killed
a
bear
as
he
had
heard
they
were
fine
eating
having
strata
of
fat
alternating
with
strata
of
lean
haynes
is
a
quiet
fellow
just
interested
in
hunting
struble
is
the
big
man
of
the
party
he
is
tall
and
strong
and
we
find
him
very
pleasant
company
then
there
is
teschall
he
is
a
quiet
fellow
with
an
unexpected
smile
he
is
so
reserved
that
i
felt
that
he
was
kind
of
out
of
place
among
the
rest
until
i
caught
his
cordial
smile
he
is
so
slight
that
i
do
see
how
he
will
stand
the
hard
climbing
not
to
mention
carrying
the
heavy
gun
they
are
using
the
largest
caliber
sporting
guns
things
that
is
all
except
harkrudder
the
picture
man
he
looks
to
be
about
forty
years
old
but
whoops
and
laughs
like
he
was
about
ten
i
do
need
to
tell
you
of
the
good
mon
do
i
he
is
just
the
kind
quiet
good
mon
that
he
has
always
been
since
i
have
known
him
a
young
lady
from
a
neighboring
camp
came
over
and
said
she
had
called
to
see
our
well
i
given
you
it
they
us
or
we
we
did
need
a
guide
as
haynes
and
struble
are
we
were
to
have
had
a
cook
but
when
we
reached
pinedale
where
we
were
to
have
picked
him
up
he
told
haynes
he
was
too
tam
seek
in
de
bel
so
we
had
to
come
without
him
but
that
is
really
no
inconvenience
since
we
are
all
very
good
cooks
and
are
all
willing
to
help
i
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
of
any
great
exploits
i
make
with
the
gun
i
fired
one
that
stewart
carries
and
it
almost
kicked
my
shoulder
off
i
am
mystified
about
license
i
know
she
would
not
shoot
one
of
those
big
guns
for
a
dozen
elk
besides
that
she
is
very
and
will
never
harm
anything
herself
although
she
likes
to
join
our
hunts
i
think
you
must
be
tired
of
this
letter
so
i
am
going
to
say
my
friend
vii
the
hunt
camp
cloudcrest
october
dear
coney
it
seems
so
odd
to
be
writing
you
and
getting
no
answers
just
now
asked
me
what
i
have
against
you
that
i
write
you
so
much
i
have
one
thing
i
told
her
i
owed
you
more
love
than
i
could
ever
pay
in
a
lifetime
and
she
said
writing
such
letters
is
a
mighty
poor
way
to
show
it
i
have
been
neglecting
you
shamefully
i
think
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
came
on
this
hunt
was
to
take
the
trip
for
and
to
tell
you
things
that
you
would
most
enjoy
so
i
will
spend
this
snowy
day
in
writing
to
you
on
the
night
of
september
there
was
the
most
awful
thunderstorm
i
ever
witnessed
flash
after
flash
of
the
most
blinding
lightning
followed
by
deafening
peals
of
thunder
and
as
it
echoed
from
mountain
to
mountain
the
uproar
was
terrifying
i
have
always
loved
a
storm
the
beat
of
hail
and
rain
and
the
roar
of
wind
always
appeal
to
me
but
there
was
neither
wind
nor
rain
just
flash
and
roar
before
the
echo
died
away
among
the
hills
another
booming
report
would
seem
to
shiver
the
atmosphere
and
set
all
our
tinware
jangling
we
are
camped
so
near
the
great
pines
that
i
will
confess
i
was
powerfully
afraid
had
the
lightning
struck
one
of
the
big
pines
there
would
not
have
been
one
of
us
left
i
could
hear
murmuring
her
prayers
when
there
was
a
lull
we
had
gone
to
bed
but
i
remain
there
so
i
sat
on
the
with
jerrine
beside
me
something
struck
the
guy
ropes
of
the
tent
and
i
was
so
frightened
i
was
too
weak
to
cry
out
i
thought
the
big
tree
must
have
fallen
in
the
lulls
of
the
storm
i
could
hear
the
men
voices
high
and
excited
they
too
were
up
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
storm
lasted
for
hours
but
at
last
it
moved
off
up
the
valley
the
flashes
grew
to
be
a
mere
glimmer
and
the
thunder
mere
rumbling
the
pines
began
to
moan
and
soon
a
little
breeze
whistled
by
so
we
lay
down
again
next
morning
the
horses
could
not
be
found
the
storm
had
frightened
them
and
they
had
tried
to
go
home
the
men
had
to
find
them
and
as
it
took
most
of
the
day
we
had
to
put
off
our
hunt
we
were
up
and
about
next
morning
in
the
first
faint
gray
light
while
the
men
fed
grain
to
the
horses
and
saddled
them
we
prepared
a
hasty
breakfast
we
were
off
before
it
was
more
than
light
enough
for
us
to
see
the
trail
dawn
in
the
mountains
how
i
wish
i
could
describe
it
to
you
if
i
could
only
make
you
feel
the
keen
bracing
air
the
exhilarating
climb
if
i
could
only
paint
its
beauties
what
a
picture
you
should
have
here
the
colors
are
very
different
from
those
of
the
desert
i
suppose
the
forest
makes
it
so
the
shadows
are
mellow
like
the
colors
in
an
old
picture
greenish
amber
light
and
a
sky
far
ahead
of
us
we
could
see
the
red
rim
rock
of
a
mountain
above
timber
line
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
turned
the
jagged
peaks
into
golden
points
of
a
crown
in
oklahoma
at
that
hour
of
the
day
the
woods
would
be
alive
with
even
at
this
season
but
here
there
are
no
and
only
the
snapping
of
twigs
as
our
horses
climbed
the
frosty
trail
broke
the
silence
we
had
been
cautioned
not
to
talk
but
neither
nor
i
wanted
to
afterwards
when
we
compared
notes
we
found
that
we
both
had
the
same
thought
we
both
felt
ashamed
to
be
out
to
deal
death
to
one
of
the
beautiful
creatures
and
we
were
planning
how
we
might
avoid
it
the
sun
was
well
up
when
we
reached
the
little
park
where
we
picketed
our
horses
then
came
a
long
hard
climb
it
is
hard
climbing
at
the
best
and
when
there
is
a
big
gun
to
carry
it
is
hard
then
too
we
had
to
keep
up
with
the
men
and
we
did
find
that
easy
to
do
at
last
we
reached
the
top
and
sat
down
on
some
boulders
to
rest
a
few
minutes
before
we
started
down
to
the
hunting
ground
which
lay
in
a
cuplike
valley
far
below
us
we
could
hear
the
roar
of
the
gros
ventre
as
it
tumbled
grumblingly
over
its
rocky
bed
to
our
right
rose
mile
after
mile
of
red
cliffs
as
the
last
of
the
quaking
asp
leaves
have
fallen
there
were
no
golden
groves
in
their
places
stood
silvery
patches
against
the
red
background
of
the
cliffs
high
overhead
a
triangle
of
wild
geese
harrowed
the
blue
sky
i
was
plumb
out
of
breath
but
men
who
are
most
gallant
elsewhere
are
absolutely
heartless
on
a
hunt
i
was
scarcely
through
panting
before
we
began
to
descend
we
received
instructions
as
to
how
we
should
move
so
as
to
keep
out
of
range
of
each
other
guns
then
haynes
and
myself
started
one
way
and
struble
and
the
other
we
were
to
meet
where
the
valley
terminated
in
a
broad
pass
we
felt
sure
we
could
get
a
chance
at
what
elk
there
might
be
in
the
valley
we
were
following
fresh
tracks
and
a
little
of
the
enthusiasm
seized
me
we
had
not
followed
them
far
when
three
cows
and
a
spike
came
running
out
of
the
pines
a
little
ahead
of
us
instantly
gun
flew
to
his
shoulder
and
a
deafening
report
jarred
our
ears
he
ran
forward
but
i
stood
still
fascinated
by
what
i
saw
our
side
of
the
valley
was
bounded
by
a
rim
of
rock
over
the
rim
was
a
sheer
wall
of
rock
for
two
hundred
feet
to
where
the
gros
ventre
was
angrily
roaring
below
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
rose
the
red
cliffs
with
their
jagged
crags
at
the
report
of
the
gun
two
huge
blocks
of
stone
almost
as
large
as
a
house
detached
themselves
and
fell
at
the
same
instant
one
of
the
quaking
asp
groves
began
to
move
slowly
i
could
believe
my
eyes
i
shut
them
a
moment
but
when
i
looked
the
grove
was
moving
faster
it
slid
swiftly
and
i
could
plainly
hear
the
rattle
of
stones
falling
against
stones
until
with
a
muffled
roar
the
whole
hillside
fell
into
the
stream
haynes
came
running
back
what
is
the
matter
are
you
hurt
why
did
you
shoot
he
asked
i
waved
my
hand
weakly
toward
where
the
great
mound
of
tangled
trees
and
earth
blocked
the
water
why
he
said
that
is
only
a
landslide
not
an
earthquake
you
are
as
white
as
a
ghost
come
on
up
here
and
see
my
fine
elk
i
sat
on
a
log
watching
him
dress
his
elk
we
have
found
it
best
not
to
remove
the
skin
but
the
elk
have
to
be
quartered
so
as
to
load
them
on
to
a
horse
and
struble
came
out
of
the
woods
just
then
they
had
seen
a
big
bunch
of
elk
headed
by
a
splendid
bull
but
got
no
shot
and
the
elk
went
out
of
the
pass
they
had
heard
our
shot
and
came
across
to
see
what
luck
what
iver
is
the
matter
with
ye
asked
haynes
told
her
they
had
heard
the
noise
but
had
thought
it
thunder
haynes
told
me
that
if
i
would
chirk
up
he
would
give
me
his
elk
teeth
though
i
do
admire
them
they
are
considered
valuable
however
his
elk
was
a
cow
and
they
do
have
as
nice
teeth
as
do
bulls
we
had
lunch
and
the
men
covered
the
elk
with
pine
boughs
to
keep
the
camp
robbers
from
pecking
it
full
of
holes
next
day
the
men
would
come
with
the
horses
and
pack
it
in
to
camp
we
all
felt
refreshed
so
we
started
on
the
trail
of
those
that
got
away
for
a
while
walking
was
easy
and
we
made
pretty
good
time
then
we
had
a
rocky
hill
to
get
over
we
had
to
use
care
when
we
got
into
the
timber
there
were
marshy
places
which
tried
us
sorely
and
windfall
so
thick
that
we
could
hardly
get
through
we
were
obliged
to
pick
our
way
carefully
to
avoid
noise
and
we
were
all
together
not
having
come
to
a
place
where
it
seemed
better
to
separate
we
had
about
resolved
to
go
to
our
horses
when
we
heard
a
volley
of
shots
that
is
somebody
said
struble
they
are
in
brewster
lake
park
by
the
sound
that
means
that
the
elk
will
pass
here
in
a
short
time
and
we
may
get
a
shot
the
elk
will
be
here
long
before
the
men
since
the
men
have
no
horses
so
let
hurry
and
get
placed
along
the
only
place
they
can
get
out
we
get
our
limit
we
hastily
secreted
ourselves
along
the
narrow
gorge
through
which
the
elk
must
pass
we
were
all
on
one
side
and
haynes
said
to
me
rest
your
gun
on
that
rock
and
aim
at
the
first
rib
back
of
the
shoulder
if
you
shoot
haphazard
you
may
cripple
an
elk
and
let
it
get
away
to
die
in
misery
so
make
sure
when
you
fire
it
did
seem
a
minute
before
we
heard
the
beat
of
their
hoofs
and
a
queer
panting
noise
that
i
ca
describe
first
came
a
beautiful
thing
with
his
head
held
high
his
great
antlers
seemed
to
lie
half
his
length
on
his
back
his
eyes
were
startled
and
his
shining
black
mane
seemed
to
bristle
i
heard
the
report
of
guns
and
he
tumbled
in
a
confused
heap
he
tried
to
rise
but
others
coming
leaped
over
him
and
knocked
him
down
some
more
shots
and
those
behind
turned
and
went
back
the
way
they
had
come
haynes
shouted
to
me
shoot
shoot
why
you
shoot
so
i
fired
my
krag
but
next
i
found
myself
picking
myself
up
and
wondering
who
had
struck
me
and
for
what
i
was
so
dizzy
i
could
scarcely
move
but
i
got
down
to
where
the
others
were
excitedly
admiring
the
two
dead
elk
that
they
said
were
the
victims
of
gun
she
was
as
excited
and
delighted
as
if
she
had
never
declared
she
would
not
kill
anything
sure
it
many
a
meal
they
make
for
little
hungry
mouths
she
said
she
was
rubbing
her
shoulder
ruefully
i
do
want
to
fire
any
more
big
guns
i
thought
old
goliar
had
hit
me
a
biff
with
a
blackthorn
shilaley
she
remarked
haynes
turned
to
me
and
said
you
are
a
dandy
hunter
you
shoot
at
all
until
after
the
elk
were
gone
and
the
way
you
held
your
gun
it
is
a
wonder
it
did
knock
your
head
off
instead
of
just
smashing
your
jaw
the
men
worked
as
fast
as
they
could
at
the
elk
and
we
helped
as
much
as
we
could
but
it
was
dark
before
we
reached
camp
supper
was
ready
but
i
went
to
bed
at
once
they
all
thought
it
was
because
i
was
so
disappointed
but
it
was
because
i
was
so
stiff
and
sore
i
could
hardly
move
and
so
tired
i
could
sleep
next
morning
my
jaw
and
neck
were
so
swollen
that
i
hated
any
one
to
see
me
and
my
head
ached
for
two
days
it
has
been
snowing
for
a
long
time
but
clyde
says
he
will
take
me
hunting
when
it
stops
i
do
want
to
go
but
reckon
i
will
have
to
because
i
do
want
to
come
so
far
and
buy
a
license
to
kill
an
elk
and
go
back
and
partly
to
get
a
rest
from
murry
everlasting
accordion
murry
is
an
acquaintance
of
he
has
a
ranch
down
on
the
river
somewhere
has
not
seen
him
for
years
did
know
he
lived
up
here
he
had
seen
the
from
whom
she
had
procured
her
license
and
so
hunted
up
our
camp
he
is
an
individual
with
sad
eyes
and
a
drooping
mouth
which
gives
his
face
a
most
hopeless
reproachful
expression
his
nose
however
seems
to
upset
the
original
plan
for
it
is
long
and
thin
and
bent
slightly
to
one
side
his
neck
is
long
and
his
adam
apple
seems
uncertain
as
to
where
it
belongs
at
supper
jerrine
watched
it
as
if
fascinated
until
i
sent
her
from
the
table
and
went
out
to
speak
to
her
about
gazing
why
mamma
she
said
i
had
to
look
he
has
swallowed
something
that
wo
go
either
up
or
down
and
i
he
choke
although
i
ca
brag
about
murry
appearance
i
can
about
his
taste
for
he
admires
it
seems
that
in
years
gone
by
he
has
made
attempts
to
marry
her
as
he
got
up
from
supper
the
first
night
he
was
with
us
he
said
mary
ellen
i
have
a
real
treat
and
surprise
for
you
just
wait
a
few
minutes
an
i
bet
you
be
happy
we
took
our
accustomed
places
around
the
fire
while
murry
hobbled
his
cayuse
and
took
an
bundle
from
his
saddle
he
seated
himself
and
took
from
the
bundle
an
accordion
he
set
it
upon
his
knee
and
began
pulling
and
pushing
on
it
he
did
what
struble
said
was
doling
a
doleful
tune
every
one
took
it
but
he
kept
doling
the
doleful
until
little
by
little
the
circle
thinned
our
tent
is
as
comfortable
as
can
be
now
that
it
is
snowing
we
sit
around
the
stoves
and
we
should
have
fine
times
if
professor
glenholdt
could
have
a
chance
to
talk
but
we
have
to
listen
to
run
nigger
run
and
the
old
gray
hoss
come
out
the
wilderness
i
sing
them
to
you
when
i
come
to
denver
with
much
love
to
you
elinore

viii
the
seventh
man
cloudcrest
october
dear
coney
i
wonder
what
you
would
do
if
you
were
here
but
i
reckon
i
had
better
not
anticipate
and
so
i
will
begin
at
the
beginning
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
we
held
a
council
the
physician
and
the
two
students
had
gone
all
had
their
limit
of
elk
except
haynes
and
myself
our
licenses
also
entitled
each
of
us
to
a
deer
a
mountain
sheep
and
a
bear
we
had
plenty
of
food
but
it
had
snowed
about
a
foot
and
i
was
beginning
to
want
to
get
out
while
the
going
was
good
two
other
outfits
had
gone
out
the
doctor
and
the
students
hired
them
to
haul
out
their
game
so
we
decided
to
stay
on
a
week
longer
that
morning
and
i
melted
snow
and
washed
the
clothes
it
was
delightful
to
have
nice
soft
water
and
we
enjoyed
our
work
it
was
almost
noon
before
we
thought
to
begin
dinner
i
suppose
you
would
say
lunch
but
with
us
it
is
dinner
none
of
the
men
had
gone
out
that
day
harkrudder
was
busy
with
his
films
and
did
come
with
the
rest
when
dinner
was
ready
when
he
did
come
he
was
excited
he
laid
a
picture
on
the
table
and
said
do
any
of
you
recognize
this
it
looked
like
a
of
our
camping
ground
it
was
a
little
blurry
but
some
of
the
objects
were
quite
clear
our
tent
was
a
white
blotch
except
for
the
outlines
the
wagons
showed
plainly
i
think
much
of
it
as
a
picture
so
i
paid
scant
attention
gave
it
close
scrutiny
presently
she
said
oh
yis
i
see
what
it
is
it
a
puzzle
picture
and
ye
find
the
man
here
he
is
hidin
beyont
the
pine
next
the
tent
exactly
said
harkrudder
but
i
had
not
expected
just
this
i
am
working
out
some
ideas
of
my
own
in
photography
and
this
picture
is
one
of
the
experiments
i
tried
the
night
of
the
storm
the
result
does
prove
my
experiment
either
way
where
were
you
stewart
during
the
storm
where
should
i
be
i
bided
i
the
bed
the
stewart
said
well
said
harkrudder
i
know
where
each
of
the
other
fellows
was
and
none
of
them
was
in
this
direction
now
who
is
the
seventh
man
i
looked
again
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
man
in
a
crouching
position
outlined
against
the
tent
wall
we
were
all
excited
for
it
was
ten
minutes
past
one
when
harkrudder
was
out
and
we
think
why
any
one
would
be
prowling
about
our
camp
at
that
time
of
the
night
as
stewart
and
i
had
planned
a
long
beautiful
ride
we
set
out
after
dinner
leaving
the
rest
yet
at
the
table
eating
and
conjecturing
about
the
stranger
within
our
picture
i
had
hoped
we
would
come
to
ground
level
enough
for
a
sharp
invigorating
canter
but
our
way
was
too
rough
it
was
a
joy
to
be
out
in
the
great
silent
forest
the
snow
made
riding
a
little
venturesome
because
the
horses
slipped
a
great
deal
but
chub
is
dependable
even
though
he
is
lazy
clyde
bestrode
haynes
old
blue
we
were
headed
for
the
cascades
on
clear
creek
to
see
the
wonderful
that
the
flying
spray
is
forming
we
had
almost
reached
the
cascades
and
were
crossing
a
little
valley
when
an
elk
calf
leaped
out
of
the
snow
and
ran
a
few
yards
it
paused
and
finally
came
irresolutely
back
toward
us
a
few
steps
farther
we
saw
great
red
splotches
on
the
snow
and
the
body
of
a
cow
elk
around
it
were
the
tracks
of
the
faithful
little
calf
it
would
stay
by
its
mother
until
starvation
or
wild
animals
put
an
end
to
its
suffering
the
cow
was
shot
in
half
a
dozen
places
none
of
them
in
a
fatal
spot
it
had
bled
to
death
that
said
stewart
angrily
comes
o
bunch
shooting
the
authorities
should
revoke
the
license
of
a
man
found
guilty
of
bunch
shooting
we
rode
on
in
silence
each
a
little
saddened
by
what
we
had
seen
but
this
was
not
all
we
had
begun
to
descend
the
mountain
side
to
clear
creek
when
we
came
upon
the
beaten
trail
of
a
herd
of
elk
we
followed
it
as
offering
perhaps
the
safest
descent
it
did
take
us
far
around
the
spur
of
the
mountain
the
herd
had
stampeded
tracks
were
everywhere
lying
in
the
trail
were
a
spike
and
an
old
bull
with
a
broken
antler
chub
shied
but
old
blue
does
scare
so
stewart
rode
up
quite
close
around
the
heads
were
tracks
we
dismount
but
we
knew
that
the
two
upper
teeth
or
tushes
were
missing
and
that
the
hated
was
at
work
the
tracks
in
the
snow
showed
there
had
been
two
men
an
adult
elk
averages
five
hundred
pounds
of
splendid
meat
here
before
us
therefore
lay
a
thousand
pounds
of
food
thrown
to
waste
just
to
enable
a
contemptible
to
obtain
four
teeth
is
against
the
law
but
this
is
a
case
where
you
must
catch
before
hanging
well
we
saw
the
cascades
and
after
resting
a
little
we
started
homeward
through
the
heavy
woods
where
we
were
compelled
to
go
more
slowly
we
had
dismounted
and
were
gathering
some
pi√±on
cones
from
a
fallen
tree
when
almost
without
a
sound
a
band
of
elk
came
trailing
down
a
little
draw
where
a
spring
trickled
we
watched
them
file
along
evidently
making
for
lower
ground
on
which
to
bed
chub
snorted
and
a
large
cow
stopped
and
looked
curiously
in
our
direction
those
behind
passed
leisurely
around
her
we
knew
she
had
no
calf
because
she
was
light
in
color
cows
suckling
calves
are
of
a
darker
shade
a
loud
report
seemed
to
rend
the
forest
and
the
beauty
dropped
the
rest
disappeared
so
suddenly
that
if
the
fine
specimen
that
lay
before
me
had
not
been
proof
it
would
almost
have
seemed
a
dream
i
had
shot
the
cow
elk
my
license
called
for
we
took
off
the
head
and
removed
the
entrails
then
covered
our
game
with
pine
boughs
to
which
we
tied
a
red
bandanna
so
as
to
make
it
easy
to
find
next
day
when
the
men
would
come
back
with
a
saw
to
divide
it
down
the
back
and
pack
it
in
there
is
an
imposing
row
of
game
hanging
in
the
pines
back
of
our
tent
supper
was
ready
when
we
got
in
haynes
had
been
out
also
and
was
very
joyful
he
got
his
elk
this
afternoon
we
can
start
home
day
after
it
will
take
the
men
all
to
get
in
the
game
i
shall
be
glad
to
start
i
am
getting
homesick
and
i
have
not
had
a
letter
or
even
a
card
since
i
have
been
here
we
are
hungry
for
war
news
and
besides
it
is
snowing
again
our
clothes
did
get
dry
either
they
are
frozen
to
the
bush
we
hung
them
on
perhaps
they
will
be
snowed
under
by
morning
i
ca
complain
though
for
it
is
warm
and
pleasant
in
our
tent
the
little
is
glowing
is
showing
jerrine
how
to
make
pigs
of
potatoes
calvin
and
robert
are
asleep
the
men
have
all
gone
to
the
bachelors
tent
to
form
their
plans
all
save
murry
who
is
serenading
he
is
playing
nelly
gray
and
somehow
i
do
want
to
laugh
at
him
as
i
usually
do
i
can
only
feel
sorry
for
him
i
can
hardly
write
because
my
heart
is
yearning
for
my
little
junior
boy
at
home
on
the
ranch
with
his
grandmother
dear
little
mother
stewart
i
feel
very
tender
toward
her
junior
is
the
pride
of
her
heart
she
would
not
allow
us
to
bring
him
on
this
trip
so
she
is
at
the
ranch
taking
care
of
my
boy
every
one
is
so
good
so
kind
and
i
can
do
so
little
to
repay
it
makes
me
feel
very
unworthy
you
think
i
have
the
blues
but
i
have
i
just
feel
humble
and
chastened
when
murry
pauses
i
can
hear
the
soft
spat
spat
of
the
falling
snow
on
the
tent
i
will
be
powerfully
glad
when
we
set
our
faces
homeward
dear
friend
angels
guard
you
elinore
stewart
ix
an
indian
camp
cloudcrest
october
dear
dear
coney
this
is
the
very
last
letter
you
will
receive
dated
from
this
camp
we
are
leaving
a
few
days
earlier
than
we
intended
and
i
am
pretty
badly
on
the
fence
i
want
to
laugh
and
really
i
can
hardly
keep
back
the
tears
we
are
leaving
sooner
than
we
meant
for
rather
a
good
reason
we
have
one
bite
to
eat
except
elk
meat
after
the
men
had
brought
into
camp
the
elk
we
killed
the
other
afternoon
they
began
to
plan
a
sheep
hunt
as
sheep
do
not
stay
in
the
woods
the
men
had
to
go
miles
away
and
above
timber
line
they
decided
to
take
a
pack
horse
and
stay
all
night
i
did
want
stewart
to
go
because
the
climbing
is
very
dangerous
no
accidents
have
happened
this
year
but
last
season
a
man
fell
from
the
crags
and
was
killed
so
i
tried
to
keep
the
good
mon
at
home
but
he
would
not
be
persuaded
the
love
of
chase
has
entered
his
blood
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
had
chased
reason
plumb
out
of
his
head
i
know
exactly
how
samantha
felt
when
josiah
go
to
the
pleasure
exertion
the
bald
spot
on
the
stewart
head
does
seem
to
remind
him
of
years
gone
by
he
is
as
joyous
as
a
boy
it
was
finally
decided
to
take
and
the
children
and
myself
to
a
neighboring
camp
about
two
miles
away
as
we
did
like
to
risk
being
frightened
by
a
possible
intruder
sorenson
the
was
in
camp
to
inspect
our
game
on
the
and
he
told
us
he
was
on
the
trail
of
and
had
routed
them
out
on
the
night
of
the
storm
but
what
they
could
have
been
doing
in
our
camp
was
as
much
a
mystery
to
him
as
to
us
well
when
we
were
ready
to
go
murry
and
the
stewart
escorted
us
it
was
a
cloudy
afternoon
and
often
great
flakes
of
snow
fell
gently
softly
the
snow
was
already
about
eighteen
inches
deep
and
it
made
sheep
hunting
slippery
and
dangerous
work
on
our
way
we
came
upon
an
indian
camp
they
were
all
huddled
about
a
tiny
fire
scattered
about
were
their
wikiups
made
of
sticks
and
pine
boughs
the
indians
were
sullen
and
angry
the
had
ordered
them
back
to
fort
washakie
where
they
belonged
their
squaws
had
jerked
their
elk
you
may
not
know
what
jerked
means
so
i
will
explain
it
means
dried
cured
they
had
all
they
were
allowed
but
for
some
reason
they
did
want
to
go
sorenson
suspects
them
of
being
in
with
the
and
he
is
narrowing
the
circle
at
the
camp
where
we
were
to
stay
we
found
kavanaugh
laid
up
with
a
sore
throat
but
she
made
us
welcome
it
would
be
a
mighty
funny
camper
who
would
as
soon
as
the
men
from
the
kavanaugh
camp
heard
our
men
plans
they
were
eager
to
go
along
so
it
ended
in
us
three
women
being
left
alone
we
said
we
were
not
afraid
and
we
tried
not
to
feel
so
but
after
dark
we
all
felt
a
little
timorous
kavanaugh
was
afraid
of
the
indians
but
i
was
afraid
they
would
bring
clyde
back
dead
from
a
fall
we
were
camped
in
an
old
cabin
built
by
the
ranger
the
kavanaughs
were
short
of
groceries
we
cooked
our
big
elk
steaks
on
sticks
before
an
open
fire
and
we
roasted
potatoes
in
the
ashes
when
our
fear
wore
away
we
had
a
fine
time
after
a
while
we
lay
down
on
fragrant
beds
of
pine
we
awoke
late
the
fire
was
dead
upon
the
hearth
and
outside
the
snow
was
piling
up
made
a
rousing
fire
and
managed
to
jolly
us
until
we
had
a
really
happy
breakfast
hour
about
three
in
the
afternoon
all
the
men
came
trooping
in
cold
wet
and
hungry
after
filling
them
with
venison
hot
potatoes
and
coffee
we
started
to
our
own
camp
the
men
were
rather
depressed
because
they
had
come
back
the
indians
were
gone
and
the
snow
lay
thick
over
the
place
where
their
fire
had
been
they
had
left
in
the
night
when
we
came
to
camp
struble
started
to
build
a
fire
but
no
matches
were
to
be
had
next
the
men
went
to
feed
grain
to
their
tired
horses
but
the
oats
were
gone
murry
sought
in
vain
for
his
beloved
accordion
harkrudder
was
furious
when
he
found
his
grinding
machine
was
gone
made
a
dash
for
the
it
was
empty
we
were
dumbfounded
each
of
us
kept
searching
and
researching
and
knowing
all
the
while
we
would
find
nothing
struble
is
a
most
cheerful
individual
and
as
says
is
a
mighty
good
fellow
even
if
he
dutch
the
indians
have
stolen
us
out
he
said
but
after
all
they
have
left
us
our
tents
and
harness
all
our
meat
and
the
road
home
so
what
matter
if
we
a
little
inconvenienced
as
to
grub
haynes
may
cry
for
sugar
but
that
wo
hurt
the
rest
any
i
saddle
and
ride
over
to
scotty
and
get
enough
to
last
us
out
we
knew
the
kavanaughs
could
not
help
us
any
but
we
grew
cheerful
in
anticipating
help
from
scotty
who
was
from
green
river
and
was
camped
a
few
miles
away
we
wanted
struble
to
wait
until
morning
but
he
said
no
it
would
make
breakfast
late
so
he
rode
off
in
the
dark
at
two
this
morning
he
came
in
almost
frozen
with
two
small
cans
of
milk
and
two
yeast
cakes
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
see
the
men
were
at
work
loading
the
game
and
breaking
camp
as
they
are
ready
now
to
take
down
this
tent
i
will
have
to
finish
this
letter
somewhere
else
x
the
at
sorenson
cabin
on
green
river
well
we
here
warmed
and
fed
and
in
much
better
trim
bodily
and
mentally
we
had
mishap
after
mishap
coming
first
the
hutton
horse
being
a
bronco
had
to
act
up
when
he
was
hitched
up
we
had
almost
more
game
than
we
could
haul
but
at
last
we
got
started
after
the
bronco
had
reared
and
pitched
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
there
are
a
great
many
springs
one
every
few
feet
in
these
mountains
and
the
snow
hid
the
pitfalls
and
made
the
ground
soft
so
that
the
wheels
cut
in
and
pulling
was
hard
then
too
our
horses
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
two
days
the
snow
being
so
deep
they
could
get
at
the
grass
hobbled
as
they
were
we
had
got
perhaps
a
mile
from
camp
when
the
leading
wagon
with
four
horses
driven
by
haynes
suddenly
stopped
the
wheels
had
sunk
into
the
soft
banks
of
a
small
spring
branch
stewart
had
to
stay
on
our
wagon
to
hold
the
bronco
but
all
the
rest
even
gathered
around
and
tried
to
help
they
hitched
on
a
snap
team
but
not
a
trace
tightened
they
did
want
to
unload
the
game
in
the
snow
the
men
lifted
and
pried
on
the
wheels
still
the
horses
would
budge
haynes
is
no
disciple
of
job
but
he
tried
manfully
to
restrain
himself
turning
to
glenholdt
who
was
offering
advice
he
said
you
get
out
i
know
what
the
trouble
is
these
horses
used
to
belong
to
a
freighter
and
are
used
to
being
cussed
it
the
greatest
nuisance
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
go
out
where
there
a
bunch
of
women
if
these
women
were
along
i
make
these
horses
get
out
of
there
said
do
lay
your
poor
driving
to
the
women
if
you
drive
by
cussin
then
we
will
stop
up
our
ears
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
i
held
my
fingers
in
ears
and
she
stopped
my
ears
else
i
might
be
able
to
tell
you
what
he
said
it
was
something
violent
i
know
i
could
tell
by
the
expression
of
his
face
he
had
only
been
doing
it
a
second
when
those
horses
walked
right
out
with
the
wagon
as
nicely
as
you
please
said
to
haynes
it
a
poor
cusser
you
are
sure
it
no
wonder
you
hesitated
to
begin
if
danny
have
sworn
better
i
have
had
to
hilp
him
we
got
along
pretty
well
after
that
haynes
kept
some
distance
ahead
but
occasionally
a
bit
of
cussin
came
back
to
us
and
we
knew
he
was
using
freighter
tactics
the
lives
in
a
tiny
little
cabin
the
door
is
so
low
that
i
had
to
stoop
to
get
in
it
was
quite
dark
when
we
got
here
last
night
but
sorenson
acted
as
if
she
was
to
see
us
i
did
think
we
could
all
get
in
a
row
of
bunks
is
built
along
one
side
of
the
cabin
a
long
tarpaulin
covers
the
bed
and
we
all
got
upon
this
and
sat
while
our
hostess
prepared
our
supper
if
one
of
us
had
stirred
we
would
have
been
in
her
way
so
there
we
sat
as
thick
as
thieves
when
supper
was
ready
six
got
off
their
perch
and
ate
when
they
were
through
six
more
were
made
happy
sorenson
had
caught
the
on
the
wall
hung
their
deadly
guns
with
silencers
on
them
to
muffle
the
report
he
showed
us
the
teeth
he
had
found
in
their
possession
the
warden
and
his
deputy
had
searched
the
men
and
their
effects
and
found
no
teeth
he
had
no
evidence
against
them
except
their
unlawful
guns
but
he
knew
he
had
the
right
men
at
last
he
found
their
contract
to
furnish
two
hundred
pair
of
teeth
it
is
a
trick
of
such
hunters
to
thrust
a
knife
into
the
meat
of
the
game
they
have
and
so
to
make
pockets
in
which
they
hide
the
teeth
but
these
fellows
had
no
such
pockets
they
jeered
at
the
warden
and
threatened
to
kill
him
but
he
kept
searching
and
presently
found
the
teeth
in
a
pail
of
lard
he
told
us
all
about
it
as
we
sat
an
eager
crowd
on
his
bed
a
warden
takes
his
life
in
his
hands
when
he
goes
after
such
fellows
but
sorenson
is
not
afraid
to
do
it
the
cabin
walls
are
covered
with
drawings
the
work
of
the
warden
gifted
children
vina
the
pretty
daughter
and
laurence
the
son
they
never
had
a
lesson
in
drawing
in
their
lives
but
their
pictures
portray
western
life
exactly
the
snow
is
not
so
deep
here
as
it
was
at
camp
but
it
is
too
deep
for
the
horses
to
get
grass
the
men
were
able
to
get
a
little
grain
from
the
warden
so
we
will
pull
out
in
the
morning
and
try
to
make
it
to
where
we
can
get
groceries
we
are
quite
close
to
where
elizabeth
lives
but
we
should
have
to
cross
the
river
and
it
was
dark
before
we
passed
her
home
i
should
like
to
see
her
but
wo
get
a
chance
to
sorenson
says
she
is
very
happy
in
all
this
round
of
exposure
the
kiddies
are
as
well
as
can
be
cold
camping
and
elk
meat
agree
with
them
we
are
in
a
tent
for
the
night
and
it
is
so
cold
the
ink
is
freezing
but
the
kiddies
are
snuggled
under
their
blankets
as
warm
as
toast
we
are
to
start
early
in
the
morning
dear
friend
i
am
glad
i
can
take
this
trip
you
you
freeze
elinore
stewart
xi
buddy
and
baby
girl
in
camp
october
dear
coney
the
day
we
left
the
was
damp
and
lowering
it
seem
it
could
have
one
good
thing
to
its
credit
but
there
were
several
things
to
be
thankful
for
one
of
them
was
that
you
were
safe
at
home
in
your
warm
dry
apartment
we
had
hardly
passed
the
great
block
buttes
when
the
biggest
wettest
flakes
of
snow
began
to
pelt
into
our
faces
i
really
like
a
storm
and
the
kiddies
would
have
enjoyed
the
snow
but
we
had
to
keep
the
tied
down
to
keep
the
bedding
dry
and
the
kiddies
get
sick
under
cover
all
the
pleasure
i
might
have
had
was
taken
away
by
the
fact
that
we
were
making
a
forced
drive
we
to
go
the
had
no
more
than
enough
food
for
his
family
and
no
horse
feed
also
the
snow
was
almost
as
deep
there
as
it
had
been
higher
up
so
the
horses
could
not
graze
we
made
it
to
cora
that
day
here
at
last
was
plenty
of
hay
and
grain
we
restocked
our
and
felt
better
toward
the
world
next
day
we
came
on
here
to
newfork
where
we
are
resting
our
teams
before
we
start
across
the
desert
which
begins
just
across
the
creek
we
are
camped
on
we
have
added
two
to
our
party
i
know
you
will
be
interested
to
know
how
it
happened
and
i
can
picture
the
astonishment
of
our
neighbors
when
we
reach
home
for
our
newcomers
are
to
be
members
of
family
we
had
all
been
sorry
we
could
not
visit
elizabeth
or
danyul
and
his
mother
we
felt
almost
as
if
we
were
sneaking
past
them
but
we
consoled
ourselves
with
promises
to
see
the
burneys
and
grandma
mortimer
yesterday
the
children
and
i
were
riding
with
in
the
buckboard
we
were
trotting
merrily
along
the
lane
that
leads
to
newfork
thankful
in
our
hearts
to
be
out
of
the
snow
for
there
is
no
snow
here
just
ahead
of
us
two
little
boys
were
riding
along
on
their
ponies
there
was
a
wire
fence
on
both
sides
of
the
lane
and
almost
at
the
end
of
the
lane
an
old
cow
had
her
head
between
the
wires
and
was
nibbling
the
tall
dead
grass
the
larger
of
the
two
boys
said
that
old
pendry
cow
and
she
eat
a
blade
of
grass
off
dad
meadow
he
rode
up
to
the
cow
and
began
beating
her
with
his
quirt
that
frightened
the
cow
and
as
she
jerked
her
head
up
the
top
wire
caught
her
across
the
top
of
her
neck
she
jerked
and
lunged
to
free
herself
and
was
cruelly
cut
by
the
barbs
on
the
wire
then
he
began
beating
his
pony
the
small
boy
said
you
a
coward
an
a
fool
billy
polk
the
cow
was
hurtin
nothin
an
you
just
tryin
to
show
off
that
pony
said
the
other
boy
shut
up
you
beggar
or
i
beat
you
an
take
them
breeches
you
got
on
off
you
an
you
can
go
without
any
they
mine
my
ma
give
to
you
the
little
fellow
face
was
scarlet
as
much
of
it
as
we
could
see
for
the
freckles
and
his
eyes
were
blazing
as
he
replied
you
man
enough
i
dare
you
to
strike
me
or
to
tech
my
clothes
both
boys
were
riding
bareback
the
small
boy
slid
off
his
back
the
other
rode
up
to
him
and
raised
his
quirt
but
the
little
one
seized
him
by
the
leg
and
in
a
jiffy
they
were
in
the
road
fighting
like
cats
i
asked
to
drive
on
but
she
said
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
you
can
try
walkin
i
goin
to
referee
this
scrap
it
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
the
small
boy
would
get
a
severe
beating
but
by
some
trick
he
hurled
the
other
headlong
into
the
green
slimy
water
that
edged
the
road
then
seizing
the
quirt
and
the
opportunity
at
the
same
time
he
belabored
billy
without
mercy
as
that
individual
climbed
up
the
slippery
embankment
blubbering
and
whipped
still
sobbing
he
climbed
upon
his
patient
pony
which
stood
waiting
and
galloped
off
down
the
lane
the
other
pony
followed
and
the
little
conqueror
was
left
afoot
was
beaming
with
delight
sure
was
a
fine
fight
a
sight
worth
coming
all
this
way
to
see
ah
but
you
the
is
a
dollar
i
be
givin
ye
only
me
purse
is
in
me
stockin
oh
the
boy
said
quickly
do
let
that
stop
you
i
look
off
another
way
i
do
know
if
she
would
have
given
him
the
money
for
just
then
some
men
came
into
the
lane
with
some
cattle
and
we
had
to
start
the
boy
got
up
on
the
back
end
of
the
buckboard
and
we
drove
on
we
could
hear
our
wagons
rumbling
along
and
knew
they
would
soon
catch
up
where
is
your
home
asked
oh
just
wherever
aunt
hettie
has
work
he
said
she
is
at
tom
now
so
i
there
too
me
and
baby
girl
where
are
your
folks
went
on
ma
dead
an
pa
gone
to
alasky
i
do
know
where
my
brothers
are
baby
girl
an
me
are
with
aunt
het
an
that
all
there
are
of
us
he
grinned
cheerfully
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
one
eye
was
fast
closing
and
he
bore
numerous
bumps
and
scratches
on
his
face
and
head
just
then
one
of
the
men
with
the
cattle
galloped
up
and
shouted
hello
it
was
burney
where
you
get
that
kid
i
guess
have
to
get
the
sheriff
after
you
for
kidnapping
bud
and
what
have
you
been
doing
to
him
anyway
entered
delightedly
into
a
recital
of
the
mixup
and
it
turned
out
that
tom
and
burney
were
one
it
was
like
meeting
an
old
friend
he
seemed
as
pleased
as
we
and
insisted
on
our
going
up
to
his
ranch
he
said
the
missus
would
feel
slighted
if
we
passed
her
by
so
we
turned
into
another
lane
and
presently
drew
up
before
the
ranch
house
the
missus
came
dancing
out
to
meet
us
and
right
welcome
she
made
us
feel
burney
went
back
to
bring
the
rest
but
they
were
already
setting
up
the
tents
and
had
supper
almost
ready
however
we
stayed
and
had
supper
with
the
burneys
they
are
powerfully
happy
and
talked
eagerly
of
themselves
and
their
prospects
it
just
grand
to
have
a
home
of
your
own
and
some
one
to
do
for
i
just
to
mend
for
tommy
but
i
always
hated
to
mend
before
said
the
missus
you
bet
burney
answered
it
is
sure
fine
to
know
somebody
at
home
with
a
pretty
pink
dress
on
waitin
for
a
fellow
when
he
comes
in
from
a
long
day
in
the
saddle
and
so
they
kept
up
their
thoughtless
chatter
but
every
word
was
as
a
stab
to
poor
aunt
hettie
she
had
baby
girl
on
her
lap
and
was
giving
the
children
their
supper
but
i
noticed
that
she
ate
nothing
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
not
strong
baby
girl
is
four
years
old
and
is
the
fattest
little
thing
she
has
very
dark
blue
eyes
with
long
black
lashes
and
the
shortest
most
little
nose
she
is
so
plump
and
rosy
that
even
the
faded
old
blue
denim
dress
could
not
hide
her
loveliness
could
not
keep
her
eyes
off
the
children
what
is
the
little
girl
name
she
asked
caroline
agnes
lucia
lavina
ida
eunice
was
the
astonishing
reply
gasped
my
she
exclaimed
is
that
oh
no
aunt
hettie
went
on
placidly
you
see
her
mother
call
her
all
the
names
so
she
just
used
the
first
letters
they
spell
callie
so
that
is
what
she
called
her
but
i
do
like
the
name
i
call
her
baby
girl
i
asked
her
how
she
ever
came
to
name
her
that
way
and
she
said
my
sister
wanted
a
girl
but
there
were
six
boys
before
this
little
one
came
each
time
she
hoped
it
would
be
a
girl
and
accordingly
selected
a
name
for
a
girl
so
there
were
six
names
saved
up
and
as
there
was
much
else
to
give
her
my
sister
gave
them
to
the
baby
after
supper
the
burneys
rode
down
to
camp
with
us
we
had
the
same
camping
ground
that
we
had
when
we
came
up
the
cabin
across
the
creek
where
we
met
grandma
mortimer
is
silent
and
deserted
the
young
couple
have
moved
away
with
their
baby
kept
talking
about
the
fight
and
burney
gave
us
the
history
of
the
children
their
mother
he
began
has
been
dead
about
eighteen
months
she
really
died
with
a
broken
heart
baby
girl
was
only
a
few
weeks
old
when
the
father
went
to
alaska
and
i
guess
he
dead
he
was
to
been
back
in
three
years
and
no
one
has
ever
heard
a
word
from
him
his
name
was
bolton
he
was
a
good
fellow
only
he
went
bughouse
over
the
gold
fields
and
just
fretted
till
he
got
away
sold
everything
for
a
grub
stake
left
his
wife
and
seven
kids
almost
homeless
but
they
managed
some
way
till
the
mother
died
with
her
last
breath
she
asked
that
the
two
youngest
be
kept
together
she
knew
the
oldest
ones
would
have
to
be
separated
she
never
did
give
up
looking
for
bolton
and
she
wanted
him
to
have
the
babies
her
sister
hettie
has
worked
around
here
for
years
her
and
rob
langley
have
been
going
to
marry
ever
since
i
can
remember
but
always
there
has
something
cropped
up
and
now
that
hettie
has
got
to
take
care
of
the
kids
i
guess
they
wo
never
marry
she
wo
burden
him
with
them
it
is
hard
for
her
to
support
them
too
work
is
scarce
and
she
ca
get
it
lots
of
times
because
of
the
kids
the
burneys
soon
went
home
and
the
rest
of
us
went
to
bed
all
except
who
was
so
cranky
and
snappy
that
we
left
her
by
the
fire
it
seemed
hours
after
when
i
awoke
she
was
still
sitting
by
the
fire
she
was
absently
marking
in
the
ashes
with
a
stick
i
happened
to
be
the
first
one
up
next
morning
and
as
i
stirred
up
the
fire
i
saw
baby
written
in
the
ashes
we
had
breakfasted
and
the
men
had
gone
their
ways
when
said
to
me
it
is
a
blessed
old
soul
mortimer
is
do
you
mind
any
good
lesson
that
she
taught
us
in
the
cabin
beyont
i
did
not
remember
she
said
pangs
of
motherhood
make
us
mothers
not
only
of
our
own
but
of
every
child
that
needs
mothering
especially
if
our
own
little
children
need
us
no
longer
fill
their
little
places
with
ones
who
do
need
us
them
her
very
words
and
it
sweet
truth
it
is
both
my
katie
and
sheridan
have
been
grown
and
gone
these
many
years
and
my
heart

ached

cora
belle

am
goin
to
get

day

well
of
it
that
in
about
two
minutes
we
were
harnessing
the
horses
and
were
off
to
lay
the
plan
before
hettie
in
time
poor
hettie
she
wept
quietly
while
the
advantages
of
the
scheme
were
being
pointed
out
she
said
i
love
the
children
dearly
but
i
am
not
sure
i
can
always
feed
and
clothe
them
that
has
worried
me
a
lot
i
am
almost
sure

xii
a
stampede
in
camp
on
the
desert
october
my
dear
dear
friend
it
is
with
a
chastened
humble
heart
that
i
begin
this
letter
i
have
stood
face
to
face
with
tragedy
and
romance
and
to
me
one
is
as
touching
as
the
other
but
you
will
know
better
when
i
tell
you
what
i
mean
we
bustled
about
to
get
started
from
newfork
now
that
we
had
started
all
were
homesick
just
ahead
of
us
was
a
drove
of
two
thousand
steers
being
driven
to
the
railroad
to
be
shipped
i
advise
you
to
keep
ahead
of
such
drives
when
you
take
such
a
trip
because
the
trampling
of
so
many
feet
makes
a
road
almost
impassable
what
had
been
snow
in
the
mountains
had
been
rain
on
the
desert
and
we
found
the
going
decidedly
bad
a
rise
of
a
hill
would
give
us
now
and
then
a
glimpse
of
a
mass
of
heaving
forms
and
the
desert
breezes
brought
to
our
ears
the
mournful
lowing
of
the
poor
creatures
sometimes
too
we
could
hear
a
snatch
of
the
songs
it
was
all
very
beautiful
and
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
hugely
except
that
my
desire
to
be
home
far
outran
the
wagon
and
i
felt
like
a
prisoner
with
clogs
we
nooned
at
the
cabin
of
timothy
hobbs
but
no
one
was
at
home
he
at
last
had
gone
back
east
for
jennie
about
the
boss
of
the
cow
outfit
came
up
on
a
splendid
horse
he
was
a
pleasant
fellow
and
he
made
a
handsome
picture
with
his
big
hat
his
great
chaps
and
his
jangling
spurs
as
he
rode
along
beside
our
wagons
talking
he
told
us
that
a
crazy
duffer
had
gone
about
over
the
desert
for
years
digging
wells
but
at
last
he
struck
water
a
few
miles
ahead
was
a
well
flowing
like
an
artesian
well
there
would
be
plenty
of
water
for
every
one
even
the
cattle
next
morning
we
could
start
ahead
of
the
herds
and
so
the
roads
would
be
a
little
better
it
was
quite
early
when
we
made
camp
in
the
same
long
draw
where
we
saw
olaf
there
was
a
great
change
where
had
been
dry
burning
sand
was
now
a
clear
little
stream
that
formed
shallow
pools
where
the
sand
had
blown
away
so
that
harder
soil
could
form
a
bottom
less
greedy
than
the
sand
off
to
our
left
the
uneasy
herd
was
being
held
in
a
wide
flat
valley
they
were
grazing
on
the
dry
sparse
herbage
of
the
desert
quite
near
the
well
the
had
stopped
and
the
cook
was
already
preparing
supper
beyond
a
few
yards
away
a
long
outfit
was
stopped
in
the
road
did
you
ever
see
the
kind
of
freight
outfit
that
is
used
to
bring
the
great
loads
across
the
desert
then
i
tell
you
about
the
one
we
camped
near
freight
wagons
are
not
made
precisely
like
others
they
are
very
much
larger
and
stronger
several
of
these
are
coupled
together
then
as
many
teams
as
is
necessary
are
hitched
on
making
a
long
unbroken
string
of
wagons
the
horses
are
arranged
in
the
same
manner
as
the
wagons
great
chains
are
used
to
pull
the
wagons
and
when
a
camp
is
made
the
whole
affair
is
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
the
harness
is
dropped
right
where
the
horse
that
bore
it
stood
many
freighters
have
what
they
call
a
coaster
hitched
to
the
last
wagon
the
coaster
is
almost
like
other
wagons
but
it
is
a
home
on
wheels
it
is
built
and
furnished
as
sheep
wagons
are
this
freighter
had
one
and
as
we
drove
past
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
form
of
a
woman
and
a
small
boy
we
camped
quite
near
them
for
an
hour
we
were
very
busy
preparing
supper
and
arranging
for
the
night
as
we
sat
at
supper
i
thought
i
had
never
known
so
quiet
and
peaceful
an
hour
the
sun
hung
like
a
great
red
ball
in
the
hazy
west
purple
shadows
were
already
gathering
a
gentle
wind
rippled
past
across
the
dun
sands
and
through
the
sage
the
chain
parts
of
the
hobbles
and
halters
made
a
clinking
sound
as
the
horses
fed
about
presently
we
heard
a
rumbling
just
like
distant
thunder
the
cowboys
sprang
into
their
saddles
we
heard
a
shot
and
then
we
knew
the
terrible
truth
the
steers
had
stampeded
for
me
the
next
few
minutes
were
an
eternity
of
frightful
confusion
and
i
found
ourselves
with
the
children
upon
our
largest
wagon
that
was
absolutely
all
the
protection
to
be
had
it
would
have
gone
down
like
a
house
of
cards
if
that
heaving
sea
of
destruction
had
turned
our
way
i
was
scared
witless
knelt
among
the
children
praying
with
white
lips
i
stood
up
watching
the
terrible
scene
the
men
hastily
set
the
horses
free
there
was
no
time
to
mount
them
and
ride
to
safety
with
so
many
little
children
and
as
there
was
nothing
to
tie
them
to
but
the
wagons
we
to
let
them
go
so
as
to
have
the
wagons
left
for
shelter
is
why
cowboys
are
such
figures
of
romance
and
in
mentioning
them
romance
is
fact
greater
love
hath
man
than
this
that
he
lay
down
his
life
for
his
brother
they
knew
nothing
about
us
only
that
we
were
defenseless
they
rode
boldly
on
their
stanch
little
horses
flanking
the
frenzied
steers
shooting
a
leader
here
and
there
as
they
got
a
chance
if
an
animal
stumbled
it
went
down
to
its
death
for
hundreds
of
pounding
hoofs
would
trample
it
to
pulp
so
it
would
have
been
with
the
boys
if
their
horses
had
stepped
into
a
badger
hole
or
anything
of
the
kind
had
happened
so
the
tide
was
turned
or
the
steers
kept
of
themselves
i
do
know
which
on
up
the
valley
instead
of
coming
up
our
draw
the
danger
was
past
presently
the
cowboys
came
straggling
back
ran
to
meet
them
so
when
two
on
one
horse
came
with
a
third
riding
close
beside
helping
to
hold
an
injured
man
on
we
knew
some
one
was
hurt
was
as
usual
ready
and
able
to
help
but
the
freighter
daughter
was
as
quick
and
had
a
mattress
ready
beside
the
coaster
by
the
time
the
cowboys
came
up
with
the
wounded
man
gently
the
men
helped
their
comrade
to
the
mattress
and
gently
and
the
girl
began
their
work
i
quieted
the
children
and
put
them
to
bed
the
men
were
busy
rounding
up
the
horses
the
cowboys
kept
talking
together
in
low
tones
and
coming
and
going
in
twos
and
threes
they
acted
so
queerly
that
i
wondered
if
some
one
else
was
not
hurt
i
asked
the
boss
if
any
more
of
his
men
were
hurt
he
said
no
none
of
men
were
i
knew
none
of
our
men
or
the
freighter
were
harmed
so
i
dismissed
fear
and
went
to
poor
boy
she
said
he
has
a
broken
thigh
and
he
hurt
inside
his
belly
is
knocked
into
a
we
will
pull
him
through
a
man
has
already
gone
back
to
newfork
to
get
an
automobile
they
will
take
him
to
rock
springs
to
the
hospital
in
the
morning
and
the
girl
were
doing
all
that
could
be
done
they
sent
me
back
to
care
for
the
children
to
keep
warm
i
crawled
under
the
blankets
but
not
to
sleep
it
did
seem
to
me
that
i
could
sleep
again
i
could
hear
the
men
talking
in
subdued
tones
the
boss
was
dispatching
men
to
different
places
presently
i
saw
some
men
take
a
lantern
and
move
off
toward
the
valley
i
could
see
the
light
twinkling
in
and
out
among
the
they
stopped
i
could
see
forms
pass
before
the
light
i
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
the
horses
were
all
safe
even
boy
haynes
dog
was
safe
shivering
and
whining
on
his
master
blankets
i
could
plainly
hear
the
hiccoughs
of
the
wounded
man
the
kept
on
with
maddening
persistence
but
at
last
his
nurses
forced
enough
hot
water
down
him
to
cause
vomiting
the
came
and
the
poor
fellow
fell
asleep
a
lantern
was
hung
upon
the
wagon
and
the
two
women
went
into
the
coaster
to
make
some
coffee
it
was
three
in
the
morning
when
the
men
of
our
outfit
came
back
they
put
on
their
heavy
coats
and
were
seeing
to
their
horses
i
asked
clyde
what
was
the
matter
hush
he
said
lie
still
it
is
olaf
but
i
want
to
help
i
said
you
ca
help
it
all
over
he
replied
as
he
started
again
to
where
the
lantern
was
gleaming
like
a
star
fallen
among
the
sage
i
tucked
the
children
in
a
little
more
snugly
then
went
over
to
the
coaster
wo
you
come
to
bed
and
rest
i
asked
no
i
not
are
me
children
covered
and
warm
yes
i
answered
what
are
them
fellys
about
down
in
the
sage
olaf
is
dead
i
said
who
says
god
is
not
merciful
now
all
the
poor
felly
troubles
are
done
with
was
him
that
caused
the
stampede
mayhap
god
send
him
peace
i
am
glad
he
will
never
be
hungry
nor
cold
any
more
yes
said
the
girl
speaking
slowly
i
am
glad
too
he
almost
lived
in
this
draw
we
saw
him
every
trip
and
he
suffer
dad
left
a
little
for
him
to
eat
and
whatever
he
could
to
wear
every
trip
the
helped
him
too
but
he
suffered
all
the
home
he
had
was
an
old
sheep
wagon
down
beyond
the
last
ridge
toward
the
valley
i
seen
him
every
two
weeks

will
listen
to
dad

desert
he
would

for
a
little
rest
when
the
wounded

girl

him
a
little
coffee

she
interrupted

horses
i

olaf
the
friend
of
horses
we
camped
last
night
at
ten
trees
we

the
mystery

day
then

it
will
take
us
two
days
from
green
river
to
reach
home
so
this
is
the
last
letter
on
the
road
when
we
made
camp
here
last
night
we
saw
some
one
coming
on
horseback
along
the
ca√±on
rim
on
the
opposite
side
the
form
seemed
familiar
and
the
horse
looked
like
one
i
had
seen
but
i
dared
not
believe
my
eyes
clyde
who
was
helping
to
draw
water
from
the
well
without
a
pulley
thought
i
was
bereft
as
i
ran
from
the
camp
toward
the
advancing
rider
but
although
i
thought
what
i
saw
must
be
a
mirage
still
i
knew
louderer
on
bismarck
out
of
breath
from
my
run
i
grasped
her
fat
ankle
and
panted
till
i
could
speak
haf
they
run
you
out
of
camp
you
iss
so
bad
she
asked
me
by
way
of
greeting
then
more
kindly
your
boy
iss
all
right
the
mutter
also
i
am
come
though
to
find
you
it
iss
time
you
are
home
with
the
haf
you
any
left
i
had
all
she
had
given
me
at
camp
joy
knew
no
bounds
never
was
one
more
welcome
than
our
beloved
neighbor
her
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
either
when
her
big
blue
eyes
rested
upon
twins
frau
she
said
severely
what
have
you
here
you
iss
robbed
an
orphan
asylum
how
haf
you
come
by
these
is
so
full
of
life
and
good
spirits
and
so
delighted
to
talk
about
her
childher
that
she
gave
a
very
animated
recital
of
how
she
became
a
happy
mother
in
turn
louderer
told
how
she
grew
more
and
more
alarmed
by
our
long
absence
but
decided
not
to
alarm
the
neighbors
so
she
had
made
a
search
party
out
of
mineself
and
had
fared
forth
to
learn
our
fate
we
had
a
merry
supper
even
haynes
became
cheerful
and
there
was
no
lagging
next
morning
when
we
started
for
home
when
people
go
on
elk
hunts
they
are
very
likely
to
return
in
tatters
so
i
am
going
to
leave
it
to
your
imagination
to
picture
our
appearance
when
we
drove
up
to
the
rear
of
the
hotel
about
sundown
our
friend
hutton
came
running
to
meet
us
i
was
ashamed
to
go
into
her
house
but
she
leaned
up
against
the
house
and
laughed
until
tears
came
chased
you
she
gasped
you
must
have
been
run
through
some
of
those
barbed
wire
things
that
they
are
putting
up
to
stop
the
german
army
hutton
is
a
little
lady
who
bolsters
up
and
makes
light
of
trying
situations
so
she
shooed
us
in
and
i
sneaked
into
my
room
and
waited
until
clyde
could
run
down
to
the
store
and
purchase
me
a
dress
i
feel
quite
clean
and
respectable
now
sitting
up
here
in
my
room
writing
this
to
you
i
will
soon
be
at
home
now
until
then
xiv
the
october
dear
dear
friend
can
you
guess
how
happy
i
am
be
it
so
humble
there
is
no
place
like
home
it
is
so
good
to
sit
in
my
creaky
old
rocker
to
hold
junior
to
feel
his
dear
weight
to
look
at
my
brave
little
mother
i
do
not
like
the
she
is
to
me
under
the
east
window
of
our
we
have
a
we
call
it
our
because
clyde
first
wife
had
it
made
and
kept
pansies
growing
there
we
poured
the
water
of
my
little
lost
boy
last
bath
onto
the
i
keep
pansies
growing
in
one
side
of
the
bed
in
memory
of
her
who
loved
them
in
the
other
end
i
plant
sweet
alyssum
in
memory
of
my
baby
a
few
pansies
and
a
tuft
of
sweet
alyssum
smiled
a
welcome
though
all
the
rest
of
my
flowers
were
dead
we
have
a
at
the
window
and
it
has
protected
the
flowers
in
the
how
happy
i
have
been
looking
over
the
place
some
young
calves
have
come
while
we
were
gone
a
whole
squirming
nest
full
of
little
pigs
my
chickens
have
outgrown
my
knowledge
there
is
no
snow
here
at
all
our
experiences
on
our
trip
seem
almost
unreal
but
the
of
meat
to
be
attended
to
is
a
reminder
of
realities
i
have
had
a
fine
trip
i
have
experienced
about
all
the
human
emotions
i
had
not
expected
to
encounter
so
many
people
or
to
get
the
little
inside
glimpses
that
i
had
but
wherever
there
are
human
beings
there
are
the
little
histories
i
have
come
home
realizing
anew
how
