a
board
with
squares
on
it
put
a
grain
of
wheat
on
the
first
square
two
on
the
second
four
on
the
third
keep
doubling
in
this
manner
and
you
will
find
there
is
enough
wheat
in
the
world
to
fill
the
square
it
can
be
the
same
with
compound
on
the
day
of
the
year
the
professor
of
history
at
the
university
of
terra
seated
himself
in
front
of
the
visaphone
and
prepared
to
deliver
the
daily
lecture
to
his
class
the
members
of
which
resided
in
different
portions
of
the
earth
the
instrument
before
which
he
seated
himself
was
very
like
a
great
window
sash
on
account
of
the
fact
that
there
were
three
or
four
hundred
frosted
glass
squares
visible
in
a
space
at
the
center
not
occupied
by
any
of
these
glass
squares
was
a
dark
oblong
area
and
a
ledge
holding
a
piece
of
chalk
and
above
the
area
was
a
huge
brass
cylinder
toward
this
brass
cylinder
the
professor
would
soon
direct
his
subsequent
remarks
in
order
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
time
to
press
the
button
which
would
notify
the
members
of
the
class
in
history
to
approach
their
local
visaphones
the
professor
withdrew
from
his
vest
pocket
a
small
contrivance
which
he
held
to
his
ear
upon
moving
a
tiny
switch
attached
to
the
instrument
a
metallic
voice
seeming
to
come
from
somewhere
in
space
repeated
mechanically
fifteen
and
one
minute
fifteen
and
one
minute
fifteen
and
one
min
quickly
the
professor
replaced
the
instrument
in
his
vest
pocket
and
pressed
a
button
at
the
side
of
the
visaphone
as
though
in
answer
to
the
summons
the
frosted
squares
began
one
by
one
to
show
the
faces
and
shoulders
of
a
peculiar
type
of
young
men
young
men
with
great
bulging
foreheads
bald
toothless
and
wearing
immense
horn
spectacles
one
square
however
still
remained
empty
on
noticing
this
a
look
of
irritation
passed
over
the
countenance
but
seeing
that
every
other
glass
square
but
this
one
was
filled
up
he
commenced
to
talk
i
am
pleased
gentlemen
to
see
you
all
posted
at
your
local
visaphones
this
afternoon
i
have
prepared
my
lecture
today
upon
a
subject
which
is
perhaps
of
more
economic
interest
than
historical
unlike
the
previous
lectures
my
talk
will
not
confine
itself
to
the
happenings
of
a
few
years
but
will
gradually
embrace
the
course
of
ten
centuries
the
ten
centuries
in
fact
which
terminated
three
hundred
years
before
the
present
date
my
lecture
will
be
an
exposition
of
the
effects
of
the
john
jones
dollar
originally
deposited
in
the
dawn
of
civilization
or
to
be
more
precise
in
the
year
of
just
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
this
john
jon
at
this
point
in
the
professor
lecture
the
frosted
glass
square
which
hitherto
had
shown
no
image
now
filled
up
sternly
he
gazed
at
the
head
and
shoulders
that
had
just
appeared
you
are
late
to
class
again
what
excuse
have
you
to
offer
today
from
the
hollow
cylinder
emanated
a
shrill
voice
while
the
lips
of
the
picture
on
the
glass
square
moved
in
unison
with
the
words
professor
you
will
perceive
by
consulting
your
class
book
that
i
have
recently
taken
up
my
residence
near
the
north
pole
for
some
reason
wireless
communication
between
the
central
energy
station
and
all
points
north
of
degrees
was
cut
off
a
while
ago
on
account
of
which
fact
i
could
not
appear
in
the
visaphone
hence
enough
sir
roared
the
professor
always
ready
with
an
excuse
i
shall
immediately
investigate
your
tale
from
his
coat
pocket
the
professor
withdrew
an
instrument
which
although
supplied
with
an
earpiece
and
a
mouthpiece
had
no
wires
whatever
attached
raising
it
to
his
lips
he
spoke
hello
central
energy
station
please
a
pause
ensued
central
energy
station
this
is
the
professor
of
history
at
the
university
of
terra
speaking
one
of
my
students
informs
me
that
the
north
pole
region
was
out
of
communication
with
the
visaphone
system
this
morning
is
that
statement
true
i
would
a
voice
apparently
from
nowhere
spoke
into
the
professor
ear
quite
true
professor
a
train
of
our
ether
waves
accidently
fell
into
parallelism
with
a
train
of
waves
from
the
venus
substation
by
the
most
peculiar
mischance
the
two
trains
happened
to
be
displaced
with
reference
to
each
other
one
half
of
a
wave
length
with
the
unfortunate
result
that
the
negative
points
of
one
coincided
with
the
positive
points
of
maximum
amplitude
of
the
other
hence
the
two
wave
trains
nullified
each
other
and
communication
ceased
for
one
hundred
and
seconds
until
the
earth
had
revolved
far
enough
to
throw
them
out
of
parallelism
ah
thank
you
replied
the
professor
he
dropped
his
instrument
into
his
coat
pocket
and
gazed
in
the
direction
of
the
glass
square
whose
image
had
so
aroused
his
ire
i
apologize
for
my
suspicions
as
to
your
veracity
but
i
had
in
mind
several
former
experiences
he
shook
a
warning
forefinger
i
will
now
resume
my
talk
a
moment
ago
gentlemen
i
mentioned
the
john
jones
dollar
some
of
you
who
have
just
enrolled
with
the
class
will
undoubtedly
say
to
yourselves
is
a
john
jones
what
is
a
dollar
in
the
early
days
before
the
present
scientific
registration
of
human
beings
was
instituted
by
the
national
eugenics
society
man
went
around
under
a
crude
system
of
nomenclature
under
this
system
there
were
actually
more
john
joneses
than
there
are
calories
in
a
british
thermal
unit
but
there
was
one
john
jones
in
particular
living
in
the
twentieth
century
to
whom
i
shall
refer
in
my
lecture
not
much
is
known
of
his
personal
life
except
that
he
was
an
ardent
socialist
a
bitter
enemy
in
fact
of
the
private
ownership
of
wealth
now
as
to
the
dollar
at
this
day
when
the
a
combination
of
the
psych
the
unit
of
esthetic
satisfaction
and
the
erg
the
unit
of
mechanical
energy
is
recognized
as
the
true
unit
of
value
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
that
in
the
twentieth
century
and
for
more
than
ten
centuries
thereafter
the
dollar
a
metallic
circular
disk
was
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
exchange
for
the
essentials
of
life
but
nevertheless
such
was
the
case
man
exchanged
his
mental
or
physical
energy
for
these
dollars
he
then
the
dollars
for
sustenance
raiment
pleasure
and
operations
for
the
removal
of
the
vermiform
appendix
a
great
many
individuals
however
deposited
their
dollars
in
a
stronghold
called
a
bank
these
banks
invested
the
dollars
in
loans
and
commercial
enterprises
with
the
result
that
every
time
the
earth
traversed
the
solar
ecliptic
the
banks
compelled
each
borrower
to
repay
or
to
acknowledge
as
due
the
original
loan
plus
six
of
that
loan
and
to
the
depositor
the
banks
paid
three
of
the
deposited
dollars
for
the
use
of
the
disks
this
was
known
as
three
percent
or
bank
interest
now
the
safety
of
dollars
when
deposited
in
banks
was
not
absolutely
assured
to
the
depositor
at
times
the
custodians
of
these
dollars
were
wont
to
appropriate
them
and
proceed
to
portions
of
the
earth
sparsely
inhabited
and
accessible
with
difficulty
and
at
other
times
nomadic
groups
known
as
visited
the
banks
opened
the
vaults
by
force
and
departed
carrying
with
them
the
contents
but
to
return
to
our
subject
in
the
year
one
of
these
numerous
john
joneses
performed
an
apparently
inconsequential
action
which
caused
the
name
of
john
jones
to
go
down
in
history
what
did
he
do
he
proceeded
to
one
of
these
banks
known
at
that
time
as
first
national
bank
of
chicago
and
deposited
there
one
of
these
disks
a
silver
dollar
to
the
credit
of
a
certain
individual
and
this
individual
to
whose
credit
the
dollar
was
deposited
was
no
other
person
than
the
fortieth
descendant
of
john
jones
who
stipulated
in
paper
which
was
placed
in
the
files
of
the
bank
that
the
descendancy
was
to
take
place
along
the
oldest
child
of
each
of
the
generations
which
would
constitute
his
posterity
the
bank
accepted
the
dollar
under
that
understanding
together
with
another
condition
imposed
by
this
john
jones
namely
that
the
interest
was
to
be
compounded
annually
that
meant
that
at
the
close
of
each
year
the
bank
was
to
credit
the
account
of
john
jones
fortieth
descendant
with
three
of
the
account
as
it
stood
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
history
tells
us
little
more
concerning
this
john
jones
only
that
he
died
in
the
year
or
ten
years
afterward
leaving
several
children
now
you
gentlemen
who
are
taking
mathematics
under
professor
of
the
university
of
mars
will
remember
that
where
any
number
such
as
x
in
passing
through
a
progressive
cycle
of
change
grows
at
the
end
of
that
cycle
by
a
proportion
p
then
the
value
of
the
original
x
after
n
cycles
becomes
x
p
obviously
in
this
case
x
equalled
one
dollar
p
equalled
three
and
n
will
depend
upon
any
number
of
years
which
we
care
to
consider
following
the
date
of
deposit
by
a
simple
calculation
those
of
you
who
are
today
mentally
alert
can
check
up
the
results
that
i
shall
set
forth
in
my
lecture
at
the
time
that
john
jones
died
the
amount
in
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago
to
the
credit
of
john
jones
the
fortieth
was
as
follows
the
professor
seized
the
chalk
and
wrote
rapidly
upon
the
oblong
space
years
elapsed
the
peculiar
sinuous
hieroglyphic
he
explained
is
an
ideograph
representing
the
dollar
well
gentlemen
time
went
on
as
time
will
until
a
hundred
years
had
passed
by
the
first
national
bank
still
existed
and
the
locality
chicago
had
become
the
largest
center
of
population
upon
the
earth
through
the
investments
which
had
taken
place
and
the
yearly
compounding
of
interest
the
status
of
john
jones
deposit
was
now
as
follows
he
wrote
years
elapsed
in
the
following
century
many
minor
changes
of
course
took
place
in
man
mode
of
living
but
the
socialists
still
agitated
widely
for
the
cessation
of
private
ownership
of
wealth
the
first
national
bank
still
accepted
dollars
for
safe
keeping
and
the
john
jones
dollar
still
continued
to
grow
with
about
generations
yet
to
come
the
account
now
stood
years
elapsed
and
by
the
end
of
the
succeeding
hundred
years
it
had
grown
to
what
constituted
an
appreciable
bit
of
exchange
value
in
those
days
thus
years
now
the
century
which
followed
contains
an
important
date
the
date
i
am
referring
to
is
the
year
or
the
year
in
which
every
human
being
born
upon
the
globe
was
registered
under
a
numerical
name
at
the
central
bureau
of
the
national
eugenics
society
in
our
future
lessons
which
will
treat
with
that
period
of
detail
i
shall
ask
you
to
memorize
that
date
the
socialists
still
agitated
fruitlessly
but
the
first
national
bank
of
chicago
was
now
the
first
international
bank
of
the
earth
and
how
great
had
john
jones
dollar
grown
let
us
examine
the
account
both
on
that
important
historical
date
and
also
at
the
close
of
the
year
since
it
was
deposited
look
years
years
but
gentlemen
it
had
not
reached
the
point
where
it
could
be
termed
an
unusually
large
accumulation
of
wealth
for
larger
accumulations
existed
upon
the
earth
a
descendant
of
a
man
once
known
as
john
rockefeller
possessed
an
accumulation
of
great
size
but
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
rapidly
dwindling
as
it
passed
from
generation
to
generation
so
let
us
travel
ahead
another
one
hundred
years
during
this
time
as
we
learn
from
our
historical
and
political
archives
the
socialists
began
to
die
out
since
they
at
last
realized
the
utter
futility
of
combating
the
balance
of
power
the
account
though
now
stood
years
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
make
any
comment
those
of
you
who
are
most
astute
and
others
of
you
who
flunked
my
course
before
and
are
now
taking
it
the
second
time
of
course
know
what
is
coming
during
the
age
in
which
this
john
jones
lived
there
lived
also
a
man
a
scientist
called
metchnikoff
we
know
from
a
study
of
our
vast
collection
of
egyptian
papyri
and
carnegie
library
books
that
this
metchnikoff
promulgated
the
theory
that
old
age
or
rather
senility
was
caused
by
this
fact
was
later
verified
but
while
he
was
correct
in
the
etiology
of
senility
he
was
crudely
primeval
in
the
therapeutics
of
it
he
proposed
gentlemen
to
combat
and
kill
this
bacillus
by
utilizing
the
fermented
lacteal
fluid
from
a
now
extinct
animal
called
the
cow
models
of
which
you
can
see
at
any
time
at
the
solaris
museum
a
chorus
of
shrill
piping
laughter
emanated
from
the
brass
cylinder
the
professor
waited
until
the
merriment
had
subsided
and
then
continued
i
beg
of
you
gentlemen
do
not
smile
this
was
merely
one
of
the
many
similar
quaint
superstitions
existing
in
that
age
but
a
real
scientist
professor
again
attacked
the
problem
in
the
century
since
the
cow
was
now
extinct
he
could
not
waste
his
valuable
time
experimenting
with
fermented
cow
lacteal
fluid
he
discovered
the
old
of
radium
the
rays
which
you
physicists
will
remember
are
not
deflected
by
a
magnetic
field
were
really
composed
of
two
sets
of
rays
which
he
termed
the
rays
and
the
rays
these
last
named
rays
only
when
isolated
completely
devitalized
all
which
lay
in
their
path
without
in
the
least
affecting
the
integrity
of
any
interposed
organic
cells
the
great
result
as
many
of
you
already
know
was
that
the
life
of
man
was
extended
to
nearly
two
hundred
years
that
i
state
unequivocally
was
a
great
century
for
the
human
race
but
i
spoke
of
another
happening
one
perhaps
of
more
interest
than
importance
i
referred
to
the
bank
account
of
john
jones
the
fortieth
it
gentlemen
had
grown
to
such
a
prodigious
sum
that
a
special
bank
and
board
of
directors
had
to
be
created
in
order
to
care
for
and
reinvest
it
by
scanning
the
following
notation
you
will
perceive
the
truth
of
my
statement
years
by
the
year
two
events
of
stupendous
importance
took
place
there
is
scarcely
a
man
in
this
class
who
has
not
heard
of
how
professor
accidentally
stumbled
upon
the
scientific
fact
that
the
effect
of
gravity
is
reversed
upon
any
body
which
vibrates
perpendicularly
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
with
a
frequency
which
is
an
even
multiple
of
the
logarithm
of
of
the
naperian
base
at
once
special
vibrating
cars
were
constructed
which
carried
mankind
to
all
planets
that
discovery
of
professor
did
nothing
less
than
open
up
seven
new
territories
to
our
inhabitants
namely
mercury
venus
mars
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
in
the
great
land
rush
that
ensued
thousands
who
were
previously
poor
became
rich
but
gentlemen
land
which
so
far
had
been
constituted
one
of
the
main
sources
of
wealth
was
shortly
to
become
valuable
for
individual
golf
links
only
as
it
is
today
on
account
of
another
scientific
discovery
this
second
discovery
was
in
reality
not
a
discovery
but
the
perfection
of
a
chemical
process
the
principles
of
which
had
been
known
for
many
centuries
i
am
alluding
to
the
construction
of
the
vast
reducing
factories
one
upon
each
planet
to
which
the
bodies
of
all
persons
who
have
died
on
their
respective
planets
are
at
once
shipped
by
aerial
express
since
this
process
is
used
today
all
of
you
understand
the
methods
employed
how
each
body
is
reduced
by
heat
to
its
component
constituents
hydrogen
oxygen
nitrogen
carbon
calcium
phosphorus
and
so
forth
how
these
separated
constituents
are
stored
in
special
reservoirs
together
with
the
components
from
thousands
of
other
corpses
how
these
elements
are
then
synthetically
combined
into
food
tablets
for
those
of
us
who
are
yet
alive
thus
completing
an
endless
chain
from
the
dead
to
the
living
naturally
then
agriculture
and
ceased
since
the
food
problem
with
which
man
had
coped
from
time
immemorial
was
solved
the
two
direct
results
were
first
that
land
lost
the
inflated
values
it
had
possessed
when
it
was
necessary
for
tillage
and
second
that
men
were
at
last
given
enough
leisure
to
enter
the
fields
of
science
and
art
and
as
to
the
john
jones
dollar
which
now
embraced
countless
industries
and
vast
territory
on
the
earth
it
stood
in
value
years
in
truth
gentlemen
it
now
constituted
the
largest
private
fortune
on
the
terrestrial
globe
and
in
that
year
there
were
thirteen
generations
yet
to
come
before
john
jones
the
fortieth
would
arrive
to
continue
in
the
year
an
important
political
battle
was
concluded
in
the
solar
system
senate
and
house
of
representatives
i
am
referring
to
the
great
controversy
as
to
whether
the
earth
moon
was
a
sufficient
menace
to
interplanetary
navigation
to
warrant
its
removal
the
outcome
of
the
wrangle
was
that
the
question
was
decided
in
the
affirmative
consequently
but
i
beg
your
pardon
young
men
i
occasionally
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
you
are
not
so
well
informed
upon
historical
matters
as
myself
here
i
am
talking
to
you
about
the
moon
totally
forgetful
that
many
of
you
are
puzzled
as
to
my
meaning
i
advise
all
of
you
who
have
not
yet
attended
the
solaris
museum
on
jupiter
to
take
a
trip
there
some
sunday
afternoon
the
interplanetary
suburban
line
runs
trains
every
half
hour
on
that
day
you
will
find
there
a
complete
working
model
of
the
old
satellite
of
the
earth
which
before
it
was
destroyed
furnished
this
planet
light
at
night
through
the
crude
medium
of
reflection
on
account
of
this
decision
as
to
the
inadvisability
of
allowing
the
moon
to
remain
where
it
was
engineers
commenced
its
removal
in
the
year
piece
by
piece
it
was
chipped
away
and
brought
to
the
earth
in
interplanetary
freight
cars
these
pieces
were
then
propelled
by
zoodolite
explosive
in
the
direction
of
the
milky
way
with
a
velocity
of
meters
per
second
this
velocity
of
course
gave
each
departing
fragment
exactly
the
amount
of
kinetic
energy
it
required
to
enable
it
to
overcome
the
backward
pull
of
the
earth
from
here
to
infinity
i
dare
say
those
are
going
yet
at
the
start
of
the
removal
of
the
moon
in
the
accumulated
wealth
of
john
jones
the
fortieth
stood
years
of
course
with
such
a
colossal
sum
at
their
command
the
directors
of
the
fund
had
made
extensive
investments
on
mars
and
venus
by
the
end
of
the
century
or
the
year
the
moon
had
been
completely
hacked
away
and
sent
piecemeal
into
space
the
job
having
required
years
i
give
herewith
the
result
of
john
jones
dollar
both
at
the
date
when
the
moon
was
completely
removed
and
also
at
the
close
of
the
year
after
its
deposit
years
years
the
meaning
of
those
figures
gentlemen
as
stated
in
simple
language
was
that
the
john
jones
dollar
now
comprised
practically
all
the
wealth
on
earth
mars
and
venus
with
the
exception
of
one
university
site
on
each
planet
which
was
of
course
school
property
and
now
i
will
ask
you
to
advance
with
me
to
the
year
in
this
year
the
directors
of
the
john
jones
fund
awoke
to
the
fact
that
they
were
in
a
dreadful
predicament
according
to
the
agreement
under
which
john
jones
deposited
his
dollar
away
back
in
the
year
interest
was
to
be
compounded
annually
at
three
percent
in
the
year
the
generation
of
john
jones
was
alive
being
represented
by
a
gentleman
named
who
was
thirty
years
of
age
and
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
lady
named
doubtless
you
will
ask
what
was
the
predicament
in
which
the
directors
found
themselves
simply
this
a
careful
appraisement
of
the
wealth
on
neptune
uranus
saturn
jupiter
mars
venus
and
mercury
and
likewise
earth
together
with
an
accurate
calculation
of
the
remaining
heat
in
the
sun
and
an
appraisement
of
that
heat
at
a
very
decent
valuation
per
calorie
demonstrated
that
the
total
wealth
of
the
solar
system
amounted
to
but
unfortunately
a
simple
computation
showed
that
if
married
miss
and
was
blessed
by
a
child
by
the
year
which
year
marked
the
thousandth
year
since
the
deposit
of
the
john
jones
dollar
then
in
that
year
there
would
be
due
the
child
the
following
amount
years
it
simply
showed
beyond
all
possibility
of
argument
that
by
we
would
be
shy
that
we
would
be
unable
to
meet
the
debt
to
john
jones
the
fortieth
i
tell
you
gentlemen
the
board
of
directors
was
frantic
such
wild
suggestions
were
put
forth
as
the
sending
of
an
expeditionary
force
to
the
nearest
star
in
order
to
capture
some
other
solar
system
and
thus
obtain
more
territory
to
make
up
the
deficit
but
that
project
was
impossible
on
account
of
the
number
of
years
that
it
would
have
required
visions
of
immense
law
suits
disturbed
the
slumber
of
those
unfortunate
individuals
who
formed
the
john
jones
dollar
directorship
but
on
the
brink
of
one
of
the
biggest
civil
actions
the
courts
had
ever
known
something
occurred
that
altered
everything
the
professor
again
withdrew
the
tiny
instrument
from
his
vest
pocket
held
it
to
his
ear
and
adjusted
the
switch
a
metallic
voice
rasped
fifteen
and
minutes
fifteen
and
minutes
fift
he
replaced
the
instrument
and
went
on
with
his
talk
i
must
hasten
to
the
conclusion
of
my
lecture
gentlemen
as
i
have
an
engagement
with
professor
of
the
university
of
saturn
at
sixteen
now
let
me
see
i
was
discussing
the
big
civil
action
that
was
hanging
over
the
heads
of
the
john
jones
dollar
directors
well
this
the
descendant
of
the
original
john
jones
had
a
lover
quarrel
with
miss
which
immediately
destroyed
the
probability
of
their
marriage
neither
gave
in
to
the
other
neither
ever
married
and
when
died
in
of
a
broken
heart
as
it
was
claimed
he
was
single
and
childless
as
a
result
there
was
no
one
to
turn
the
solar
system
over
to
immediately
the
interplanetary
government
stepped
in
and
took
possession
of
it
at
that
instant
of
course
private
property
ceased
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
almost
we
reached
the
true
socialistic
and
democratic
condition
for
which
man
had
futilely
hoped
throughout
the
ages
that
is
all
today
gentlemen
class
is
dismissed
one
by
one
the
faces
faded
from
the
visaphone
for
a
moment
the
professor
stood
ruminating
a
wonderful
man
that
old
socialist
john
jones
the
first
he
said
softly
to
himself
a
farseeing
man
a
bright
man
considering
that
he
lived
in
such
a
dark
era
as
the
twentieth
century
but
how
nearly
his
scheme
went
wrong
suppose
that
fortieth
descendant
had
been
born
