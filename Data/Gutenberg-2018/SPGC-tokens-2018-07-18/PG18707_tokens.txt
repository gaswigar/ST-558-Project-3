bibliography
introduction
chiefly
concerning
sources
the
material
for
this
book
falls
roughly
into
two
parts
spoken
and
written
gilbert
chesterton
was
not
an
old
man
when
he
died
and
many
of
his
friends
and
contemporaries
have
told
me
incidents
and
recalled
sayings
right
back
to
his
early
boyhood
this
part
of
the
material
has
been
unusually
rich
and
copious
so
that
i
could
get
a
clearer
picture
of
the
boy
and
the
young
man
than
is
usually
granted
to
the
biographer
the
book
has
been
in
the
making
for
six
years
and
in
three
countries
several
times
i
hid
it
aside
for
some
months
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
a
fresh
view
of
it
i
talked
to
all
sorts
of
people
heard
all
sorts
of
ideas
saw
my
subject
from
every
side
i
went
to
paris
to
see
one
old
friend
to
indiana
to
see
others
met
for
the
first
time
in
lengthy
talk
maurice
baring
wells
and
bernard
shaw
went
to
kingsland
to
see
belloc
gathered
gilbert
boyhood
friends
of
the
junior
debating
club
in
london
and
visited
father
brown
among
his
yorkshire
moors
armed
with
a
notebook
i
tried
to
miss
none
who
had
known
gilbert
well
especially
in
his
youth
bentley
lucian
oldershaw
lawrence
solomon
edward
fordham
i
had
ten
long
letters
from
annie
firmin
my
most
valuable
witness
as
to
gilbert
childhood
for
information
on
the
next
period
of
his
life
i
talked
to
monsignor
to
hilaire
belloc
maurice
baring
charles
somers
cocks
eccles
and
others
besides
being
now
able
to
draw
on
my
own
memories
frances
i
had
talked
with
on
and
off
about
their
early
married
years
ever
since
i
had
first
known
them
but
she
was
alas
too
ill
and
consequently
too
emotionally
unstrung
during
the
last
months
for
me
to
ask
her
all
the
questions
springing
in
my
mind
tell
maisie
she
said
to
dorothy
collins
not
to
talk
to
me
about
gilbert
it
makes
me
cry
for
the
time
at
beaconsfield
out
of
a
host
of
friends
the
most
valuable
were
pocock
and
bakewell
among
priests
monsignors
and
ronald
knox
fathers
vincent
mcnabb
and
ignatius
rice
were
especially
intimate
dorothy
collins
evidence
covers
a
period
of
ten
years
that
of
wells
and
bernard
shaw
is
reinforced
by
most
valuable
letters
which
they
have
kindly
allowed
me
to
publish
then
too
gilbert
was
so
much
of
a
public
character
and
so
popular
with
his
fellow
journalists
that
stories
of
all
kinds
abound
concerning
him
there
is
a
kind
of
evidence
and
very
valuable
it
is
that
may
be
called
a
boswell
collective
it
is
fitting
that
it
should
be
so
we
can
not
picture
like
the
great
lexicographer
accompanied
constantly
by
one
ardent
and
observant
witness
pencil
in
hand
ready
to
take
notes
over
the
teacups
and
by
the
way
in
spite
of
an
acquaintance
who
regretted
in
this
connection
that
was
not
latterly
more
often
seen
in
taverns
it
was
over
the
teacups
even
more
than
over
the
wine
glasses
that
boswell
made
his
notes
i
have
seen
boswell
signature
after
wine
on
the
minutes
of
a
meeting
of
the
club
and
he
was
in
no
condition
then
for
the
taking
of
notes
even
the
signature
is
almost
illegible
but
it
is
fitting
that
gilbert
who
loved
all
sorts
of
men
so
much
should
be
kept
alive
for
the
future
by
all
sorts
of
men
from
the
focussing
of
many
views
from
many
angles
this
picture
has
been
composed
but
they
are
all
views
of
one
man
and
the
picture
will
show
i
think
a
singular
unity
when
whistler
as
gilbert
himself
once
said
painted
a
portrait
he
made
and
destroyed
many
sketches
how
many
it
did
not
matter
for
all
even
of
his
failures
were
fruitful
but
it
would
have
mattered
frightfully
if
each
time
he
looked
up
he
found
a
new
subject
sitting
placidly
for
his
portrait
gilbert
was
fond
of
asking
in
the
of
people
who
expressed
admiration
for
lloyd
george
which
george
do
you
mean
for
the
politician
has
worn
many
colours
and
the
portrait
painted
in
would
have
had
to
be
torn
up
in
but
gather
the
chesterton
portraits
read
the
files
when
he
first
grew
into
fame
talk
to
titterton
who
worked
with
him
on
the
in
and
on
in
collect
witnesses
from
his
boyhood
to
his
old
age
from
dublin
to
vancouver
individuals
who
knew
him
groups
who
are
endeavoring
to
work
out
his
ideas
all
will
agree
on
the
ideas
and
on
the
man
as
making
one
pattern
throughout
one
developing
but
integrated
mind
and
personality
gathering
the
material
for
a
biography
bears
some
resemblance
to
interrogating
witnesses
in
a
court
of
law
there
are
good
witnesses
and
bad
reliable
and
unreliable
memories
i
remember
an
old
lady
a
friend
of
my
mother
who
remarked
with
candour
after
my
mother
had
confided
to
her
something
of
importance
my
dear
i
must
go
and
write
that
down
immediately
before
my
imagination
gets
mixed
with
my
memory
one
witness
must
be
checked
against
another
there
will
be
discrepancies
in
detail
but
the
main
facts
will
in
the
end
emerge
just
now
and
again
however
a
biographer
like
a
judge
meets
a
totally
unreliable
witness
one
event
in
this
biography
has
caused
me
more
trouble
than
anything
else
the
marconi
scandal
and
the
trial
of
cecil
chesterton
for
criminal
libel
which
grew
out
of
it
as
luck
would
have
it
it
was
on
this
that
i
had
to
interrogate
my
most
unreliable
witness
i
had
seen
no
clear
and
unbiased
account
so
i
had
to
read
the
many
pages
of
blue
book
and
law
reports
besides
contemporary
comment
in
various
papers
i
have
no
legal
training
but
one
point
stuck
out
like
a
spike
cecil
chesterton
had
brought
accusations
against
godfrey
isaacs
not
only
concerning
his
own
past
career
as
a
company
promoter
but
also
concerning
his
dealings
with
the
government
over
the
marconi
contract
in
connection
with
which
he
had
also
fiercely
attacked
rufus
isaacs
herbert
samuel
and
other
ministers
of
the
crown
but
in
the
witness
box
he
accepted
the
word
of
the
very
ministers
he
had
been
attacking
and
declared
that
he
no
longer
accused
them
of
corruption
which
seemed
to
me
a
complete
abandonment
of
his
main
position
having
drafted
my
chapter
on
marconi
i
asked
cecil
chesterton
to
read
it
but
more
particularly
to
explain
this
point
she
gave
me
a
long
and
detailed
account
of
how
cecil
had
been
intensely
reluctant
to
take
this
course
but
violent
pressure
had
been
exerted
on
him
by
his
father
and
by
gilbert
who
were
both
in
a
state
of
panic
over
the
trial
unlikely
as
this
seemed
especially
in
gilbert
case
the
account
was
so
circumstantial
and
from
so
near
a
connection
that
i
felt
almost
obliged
to
accept
it
what
was
my
amazement
a
few
months
later
at
receiving
a
letter
in
which
she
stated
that
after
a
great
deal
of
close
research
work
of
papers
etc
in
connection
with
her
own
book
and
after
a
talk
with
cecil
solicitors
she
had
become
convinced
that
cecil
had
acted
as
he
had
because
the
closest
sleuthing
had
been
unable
to
discover
any
trace
of
investments
by
rufus
isaacs
in
english
marconis
for
this
reason
cecil
took
the
course
he
did
not
through
family
pressure
that
pressure
still
was
exerted
though
possibly
not
until
the
trial
was
over
italics
mine
it
was
then
the
lady
feelings
and
not
facts
that
had
been
offered
to
me
as
evidence
and
it
was
the
merest
luck
that
my
book
had
not
appeared
before
cecil
solicitors
had
spoken
the
account
given
in
lord
birkenhead
is
the
speech
for
the
prosecution
cecil
chesterton
chapter
is
an
impressionist
sketch
of
the
court
scene
by
a
friend
of
the
defendant
what
was
wanted
was
an
impartial
account
but
i
tried
in
vain
to
write
it
the
chronology
of
events
the
connection
between
the
government
commission
and
the
libel
case
the
connection
between
the
english
and
american
marconi
companies
it
was
all
too
complex
for
the
lay
mind
so
i
turned
the
chapter
over
to
my
husband
who
has
had
a
legal
training
and
asked
him
to
write
it
for
me
is
concerned
with
gilbert
and
frances
as
well
as
with
cecil
and
the
confusion
between
memory
and
imagination
to
say
nothing
of
reliance
on
feelings
unsupported
by
facts
pervades
the
book
it
can
only
be
called
a
legend
so
long
growing
in
mind
that
i
am
convinced
that
when
she
came
to
write
her
book
she
firmly
believed
in
it
herself
the
was
so
ardent
a
dislike
for
frances
that
every
incident
poured
fuel
on
the
flame
and
was
seen
only
by
its
light
when
i
saw
her
the
legend
was
beginning
to
shape
she
told
me
various
stories
showing
her
dislike
facts
offered
by
me
were
either
denied
or
twisted
to
fit
into
the
pattern
i
do
not
propose
to
discuss
here
the
details
of
a
thoroughly
unreliable
book
most
of
them
i
think
answer
themselves
in
the
course
of
this
biography
with
one
or
two
points
i
deal
in
appendix
but
i
will
set
down
here
one
further
incident
that
serves
to
show
just
how
little
help
this
particular
witness
could
ever
be
for
like
cecil
solicitors
i
spoilt
one
telling
detail
for
her
she
told
me
with
great
enthusiasm
that
cecil
had
said
that
gilbert
was
really
in
love
not
with
frances
but
with
her
sister
gertrude
and
that
gertrude
red
hair
accounted
for
the
number
of
heroines
in
his
stories
i
told
her
however
on
the
word
of
their
that
gertrude
hair
was
not
red
oldershaw
in
fact
seemed
a
good
deal
amused
he
said
that
gilbert
never
looked
at
either
of
the
other
sisters
who
were
not
his
sort
and
had
eyes
only
for
frances
cecil
however
would
not
relinquish
this
dream
of
red
hair
and
another
love
in
her
book
she
wishes
hair
on
to
annie
firmin
because
in
the
gilbert
had
described
her
golden
plaits
but
unluckily
for
this
new
theory
annie
hair
was
yellow
which
is
quite
a
different
colour
and
annie
who
is
still
alive
is
also
amused
at
the
idea
that
gilbert
had
any
thought
of
romance
in
her
connection
see
letter
to
her
daughter
chapter
xxxi
when
frances
chesterton
gave
me
the
letters
and
other
documents
she
said
i
do
want
the
book
to
appear
in
a
hurry
not
for
at
least
five
years
there
will
be
lots
of
little
books
written
about
gilbert
let
them
all
come
out
first
i
want
your
book
to
be
the
final
and
definitive
biography
the
first
part
of
this
injunction
i
have
certainly
obeyed
for
it
will
be
just
seven
years
after
his
death
that
this
book
appears
for
the
second
half
i
can
say
only
that
i
have
done
the
best
that
in
me
lies
to
obey
it
also
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
those
who
have
preceded
me
with
books
depicting
one
aspect
or
another
of
my
subject
i
have
tried
to
make
use
of
them
all
as
part
of
my
material
and
some
are
little
merely
in
the
number
of
their
pages
i
am
especially
grateful
to
hilaire
belloc
emile
cammaerts
cyril
clemens
and
father
brown
who
have
allowed
me
to
quote
with
great
freedom
i
want
to
thank
seward
collins
cyril
clemens
and
the
university
of
notre
dame
for
the
loan
of
books
bambridge
for
the
use
of
a
letter
from
kipling
and
a
poem
from
years
even
greater
has
been
the
kindness
of
those
friends
of
my
own
and
of
gilbert
chesterton
who
have
read
this
book
in
manuscript
and
made
very
valuable
criticisms
and
suggestions
may

collins

connor

monsignor
most
of
the
criticisms
were
visibly
right
while
even
those
with
which
i
could
not
concur
showed
me
the
weak
spot
in
my
work
that
had
occasioned
them
they
have
helped
me
to
improve
the
book
i
think
i
may
say
enormously
one
suggestion
i
have
not
followed
that
one
name
should
be
used
throughout
either
chesterton
or
gilbert
or
but
not
all
three
i
had
begun
with
the
idea
of
using
chesterton
when
speaking
of
him
as
a
public
character
and
also
when
speaking
of
the
days
before
i
did
in
fact
call
him
gilbert
but
this
often
left
him
and
cecil
mixed
up
then
too
though
i
seldom
used
myself
other
friends
writing
to
me
of
him
often
used
it
i
began
to
go
through
the
manuscript
unifying
and
then
i
noticed
that
in
a
single
paragraph
of
his
gilbert
uses
gbs
shaw
bernard
shaw
and
mr
shaw
here
was
a
precedent
indeed
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
really
the
natural
thing
to
do
after
all
we
do
talk
of
people
now
by
one
name
now
by
another
it
is
a
matter
of
slight
importance
if
of
any
and
i
decided
to
let
it
go
as
to
size
i
am
afraid
the
present
book
is
a
large
one
although
not
as
large
as
boswell
or
with
the
but
in
this
matter
i
am
unrepentant
for
i
have
faith
in
chesterton
own
public
the
book
is
large
because
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
chesterton
on
to
the
canvas
it
is
a
joke
he
would
himself
have
enjoyed
but
it
is
also
a
serious
statement
for
a
complete
portrait
of
chesterton
even
the
most
rigorous
selection
of
material
can
not
be
compressed
into
a
smaller
space
i
have
first
written
at
length
and
then
cut
and
cut
at
first
i
had
intended
to
omit
all
matter
already
given
in
the
then
i
realised
that
would
never
do
for
some
things
which
are
vital
to
a
complete
biography
of
chesterton
are
not
only
told
in
the
better
than
i
could
tell
them
but
are
recorded
there
and
nowhere
else
and
this
book
is
not
merely
a
supplement
to
the
it
is
the
life
of
chesterton
the
same
problem
arises
with
regard
to
the
published
books
and
i
have
tried
to
solve
it
on
the
same
line
there
has
rung
in
my
mind
belloc
saying
a
man
is
his
mind
to
tell
the
story
of
a
man
of
letters
while
avoiding
quotation
from
or
reference
to
his
published
works
is
simply
not
to
tell
it
at
christopher
dawson
suggestion
i
have
all
the
books
the
order
in
which
they
were
thus
trying
to
get
the
development
of
gilbert
mind
perfectly
clear
to
myself
and
to
trace
the
influences
that
affected
him
at
various
dates
for
this
reason
i
have
analysed
certain
of
the
books
and
not
others
those
which
showed
this
mental
development
most
clearly
at
various
stages
or
those
too
many
alas
which
are
out
of
print
and
hard
to
obtain
but
whenever
possible
in
illustrating
his
mental
history
i
have
used
unpublished
material
so
that
even
the
most
ardent
chestertonian
will
find
much
that
is
new
to
him
for
the
period
of
gilbert
youth
there
are
many
exercise
books
mostly
only
half
filled
containing
sketches
and
caricatures
lists
of
titles
for
short
stories
and
chapters
unfinished
short
stories
several
completed
fairy
stories
and
some
of
the
best
drawings
were
published
in
coloured
others
are
hints
later
used
in
his
own
novels
there
is
a
fragment
of
ball
and
the
a
first
suggestion
for
man
who
was
a
rather
more
developed
adumbration
of
napoleon
of
notting
this
i
think
is
later
than
most
of
the
notebooks
but
after
the
change
in
handwriting
apparently
deliberately
and
carefully
made
by
gilbert
around
the
date
at
which
he
left
paul
for
the
slade
school
it
is
almost
impossible
to
establish
a
date
at
all
exactly
for
any
one
of
these
notebooks
notes
made
later
when
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
dictation
became
difficult
to
read
not
through
bad
handwriting
but
because
words
are
abbreviated
and
letters
omitted
some
of
the
exercise
books
appear
to
have
been
begun
thrown
aside
and
used
again
later
there
is
among
them
one
only
of
real
biographical
importance
a
book
deliberately
used
for
the
development
of
a
philosophy
of
life
dated
in
two
places
to
which
i
devote
a
chapter
and
which
i
refer
to
as
notebook
this
book
is
as
important
in
studying
chesterton
as
the
pensées
would
be
for
a
student
of
pascal
he
is
here
already
a
master
of
phrase
in
a
sense
which
makes
a
comparison
with
pascal
especially
apt
for
he
often
packs
so
much
meaning
into
a
brilliant
sentence
or
two
that
i
have
felt
it
worth
while
in
dealing
especially
with
some
of
the
less
remembered
books
to
pull
out
a
few
of
these
sentences
for
quotation
apart
from
their
context
other
important
material
was
to
be
found
in
in
articles
in
other
periodicals
and
in
unpublished
letters
with
some
of
the
correspondences
i
have
made
considerable
use
of
both
sides
and
if
anyone
pedantically
objects
that
that
is
unusual
in
a
biography
i
will
adapt
a
phrase
of
bernard
shaw
which
you
will
find
in
this
book
and
say
hang
it
all
be
reasonable
if
you
had
the
choice
between
reading
me
and
reading
wells
and
shaw
would
you
choose
wells

gilbert
keith
chesterton
chapter
i
background
for
gilbert
keith
chesterton
it
is
usual
to
open
a
biography
with
some
account
of
the
ancestry
chesterton
in
his
after
some
excellent
foolery
about
makes
the
suggestion
that
ancestry
is
far
more
varied
and
interesting
than
the
ancestry
of
the
aristocrat
the
truth
is
that
aristocrats
exhibit
less
of
the
romance
of
pedigree
than
any
other
people
in
the
world
for
since
it
is
their
principle
to
marry
only
within
their
own
class
and
mode
of
life
there
is
no
opportunity
in
their
case
for
any
of
the
more
interesting
studies
in
heredity
they
exhibit
almost
the
unbroken
uniformity
of
the
lower
animals
it
is
in
the
middle
classes
that
we
find
the
poetry
of
genealogy
it
is
the
suburban
grocer
standing
at
his
shop
door
whom
some
wild
dash
of
eastern
or
celtic
blood
may
drive
suddenly
to
a
whole
holiday
or
a
crime
this
may
provide
fun
for
a
guessing
game
but
is
not
very
useful
to
a
biographer
the
chesterton
family
like
many
another
had
had
the
ups
and
downs
in
social
position
that
accompany
the
ups
and
downs
of
fortune
upon
all
this
edward
chesterton
gilbert
father
as
head
of
the
family
possessed
many
interesting
documents
after
his
death
gilbert
mother
left
his
papers
undisturbed
but
when
she
died
gilbert
threw
away
without
examination
most
of
the
contents
of
his
father
study
including
all
family
records
thus
i
can
not
offer
any
sort
of
family
tree
but
it
is
possible
to
show
the
kind
of
family
and
the
social
atmosphere
into
which
gilbert
chesterton
was
born
some
of
the
relatives
say
that
the
family
hailed
from
the
village
of
chesterton
now
merged
into
cambridge
of
which
they
were
lords
of
the
manor
but
gilbert
refused
to
take
this
seriously
in
an
introduction
to
a
book
called
in
old
he
wrote
i
have
never
been
to
cambridge
except
as
an
admiring
visitor
i
have
never
been
to
chesterton
at
all
either
from
a
sense
of
unworthiness
or
from
a
faint
superstitious
feeling
that
i
might
be
fulfilling
a
prophecy
in
the
countryside
anyone
with
a
sense
of
the
savour
of
the
old
english
country
rhymes
and
tales
will
share
my
vague
alarm
that
the
steeple
might
crack
or
the
market
cross
fall
down
for
a
smaller
thing
than
the
coincidence
of
a
man
named
chesterton
going
to
chesterton
at
the
time
of
the
regency
the
head
of
the
family
was
a
friend
of
the
prince
and
perhaps
as
a
result
of
such
company
dissipated
his
fortunes
in
riotous
living
and
incurred
various
terms
of
imprisonment
for
debt
from
his
debtors
prisons
he
wrote
letters
and
sixty
years
later
edward
chesterton
used
to
read
them
to
his
family
as
also
those
of
another
interesting
relative
captain
george
laval
chesterton
prison
reformer
and
friend
of
fry
and
of
charles
dickens
a
relative
recalls
the
sentence
i
cried
dickens
cried
we
all
cried
which
makes
one
rather
long
for
the
rest
of
the
letter
george
laval
chesterton
left
two
books
one
a
kind
of
autobiography
the
other
a
work
on
prison
reform
it
was
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
for
reform
of
optimism
and
of
energy
dickens
was
stirring
the
minds
of
englishmen
to
discover
the
evils
in
their
land
and
rush
to
their
overthrow
darwin
was
writing
his
of
which
in
some
curious
way
increased
the
hopeful
energy
of
his
countrymen
they
seemed
to
feel
it
much
more
satisfying
to
have
been
once
animal
and
have
become
human
than
to
be
fallen
gods
who
could
again
be
made
divine
anyhow
there
were
giants
in
those
days
and
it
was
hope
that
made
them
so
when
by
an
odd
confusion
the
described
chesterton
as
having
been
born
about
the
date
that
captain
chesterton
published
his
books
he
replied
in
a
ballade
which
at
once
saluted
and
attacked
i
am
not
fond
of
anthropoids
as
such
i
never
went
to
darwin
school
old
tyndall
ether
that
he
liked
so
much
leaves
me
i
fear
comparatively
cool
i
can
not
say
my
heart
with
hope
is
full
because
a
donkey
by
continual
kicks
turns
slowly
into
something
like
a
mule
i
was
not
born
in
age
of
my
fathers
truer
at
the
touch
than
mine
great
age
of
dickens
youth
and
yule
had
your
strong
virtues
stood
without
a
crutch
i
might
have
deemed
man
had
no
need
of
rule
but
i
was
born
when
petty
poets
pule
when
madmen
used
your
liberty
to
mix
lucre
and
lust
bestial
and
beautiful
i
was
not
born
in
quoted
in
chesterton
a
aliston
rivers
pp
both
and
are
worth
reading
they
breathe
the
great
gusto
seen
by
gilbert
in
that
era
he
does
not
quote
them
in
his
but
just
mentioning
captain
chesterton
dwells
chiefly
on
his
grandfather
who
while
george
laval
chesterton
was
fighting
battles
and
reforming
prisons
had
succeeded
to
the
headship
of
a
house
agents
business
in
kensington
for
the
family
fortunes
having
been
dissipated
had
become
first
a
coal
merchant
and
then
a
house
agent
a
few
of
the
letters
between
this
ancestor
and
his
son
remain
and
they
are
interesting
confirming
gilbert
description
in
the
of
his
grandfather
feeling
that
he
himself
was
something
of
a
landmark
in
kensington
and
that
the
family
business
was
honourable
and
important
see
appendix
a
the
chestertons
whatever
the
ups
and
downs
of
their
past
history
were
by
now
established
in
that
english
respectability
in
which
their
son
was
to
discover
or
into
which
he
was
to
bring
a
glow
and
thrill
of
adventurous
romance
edward
chesterton
father
belonged
to
a
serious
family
and
a
serious
generation
which
took
its
work
as
a
duty
and
its
profession
as
a
vocation
i
wonder
what
young
today
just
entering
the
family
business
would
receive
a
letter
from
his
father
adjuring
him
to
become
an
active
steady
and
honourable
man
of
business
speaking
of
abilities
which
only
want
to
be
judiciously
brought
out
of
course
assisted
with
your
earnest
gilbert
mother
was
marie
grosjean
one
of
a
family
of
children
the
family
had
long
been
english
but
came
originally
from
french
switzerland
marie
mother
was
from
an
aberdeen
family
of
keiths
which
gave
gilbert
his
second
name
and
a
dash
of
scottish
blood
which
appealed
strongly
to
my
affections
and
made
a
sort
of
scottish
romance
in
my
childhood
marie
father
whom
gilbert
never
saw
had
been
one
of
the
old
wesleyan
and
was
thus
involved
in
public
controversy
a
characteristic
which
has
descended
to
his
grandchild
he
was
also
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
early
teetotal
movement
a
characteristic
which
has
not
pp
when
edward
became
engaged
to
marie
grosjean
he
complained
that
his
dearest
girl
would
not
believe
that
he
had
any
work
to
do
but
he
was
in
fact
much
occupied
and
increasingly
responsible
for
the
family
business
there
is
a
flavour
of
a
world
very
remote
from
ours
in
the
packet
of
letters
between
the
two
and
from
their
various
parents
aunts
and
sisters
to
one
another
during
their
engagement
edward
illuminates
poems
for
a
certaln
dear
good
little
child
sketches
the
look
out
from
home
for
her
mother
hopes
they
did
not
appear
uncivil
in
wandering
into
the
garden
together
at
an
aunt
house
and
leaving
the
rest
of
the
company
for
too
long
he
praises
a
friend
of
hers
as
intellectual
and
unaffected
two
excellent
things
in
woman
describes
a
clerk
sent
to
france
with
business
papers
who
lost
them
all
the
careless
dog
except
the
london
a
letter
to
marie
from
her
sister
harriette
is
amusing
she
describes
her
efforts
at
entertaining
in
the
absence
of
her
mother
the
company
were
great
swells
so
that
her
brother
took
all
the
covers
of
the
chairs
himself
and
had
the
wine
iced
and
we
dined
in
full
dress
it
was
very
awful
considering
myself
as
hostess
poor
girl
it
was
a
series
of
misfortunes
the
dinner
was
of
an
hour
late
the
fish
done
to
rags
she
had
hired
three
dozen
to
be
sure
of
enough
but
they
were
brought
in
in
twos
and
threes
at
a
time
and
then
a
hiatus
as
if
they
were
being
washed
which
they
were
not
in
the
letters
from
parents
and
older
relatives
religious
observances
are
taken
for
granted
and
there
is
an
obvious
sincerity
in
the
many
allusions
to
god
will
and
god
guidance
of
human
life
no
one
reading
them
could
doubt
that
the
description
of
a
dying
relative
as
ready
for
the
summons
and
to
going
home
is
a
sincere
one
other
letters
notably
harriette
do
not
lack
a
spice
of
malice
in
speaking
of
those
whose
religion
was
unreal
and
affected
a
phenomenon
that
only
appears
in
an
age
when
real
religion
abounds
doubtless
her
generation
was
beginning
to
see
christianity
with
less
than
the
simplicity
of
their
parents
they
were
hearing
of
darwin
and
spencer
and
the
optimism
which
accompanied
the
idea
of
evolution
was
turning
religion
into
a
vague
glow
which
would
they
felt
survive
the
somewhat
childish
dogmas
in
which
our
rude
ancestors
had
tried
to
formulate
it
but
with
an
increased
vagueness
went
also
with
the
more
liberal
and
the
chestertons
were
essentially
liberal
both
politically
and
theologically
an
increased
tolerance
in
several
of
his
letters
edward
chesterton
mentions
the
catholic
church
and
certainly
with
no
dislike
he
went
on
one
occasion
to
hear
manning
preach
and
much
admired
the
sermon
although
he
notes
too
that
he
found
in
it
no
distinctively
roman
catholic
doctrine
he
belonged
however
to
an
age
that
on
the
whole
found
the
rest
of
life
more
exciting
and
interesting
than
religion
an
age
that
had
kept
the
christian
virtues
and
still
believed
that
these
virtues
could
stand
alone
without
the
support
of
the
christian
creed
the
temptation
to
describe
dresses
has
always
to
be
sternly
resisted
when
dealing
with
any
part
of
the
victorian
era
so
merely
pausing
to
note
that
it
seems
to
have
been
a
triumph
on
the
part
of
grosjean
to
have
cut
a
skirt
out
of
yards
of
material
i
reluctantly
lay
aside
the
letters
at
the
time
when
edward
chesterton
and
marie
were
married
and
had
set
about
living
happily
ever
after
these
two
had
no
fear
of
life
they
belonged
to
a
generation
which
cheerfully
created
a
home
and
brought
fresh
life
into
being
in
doing
it
they
did
a
thousand
other
things
so
that
the
home
they
made
was
full
of
vital
energies
for
the
children
who
were
to
grow
up
in
it
gilbert
recollects
his
father
as
a
man
of
a
dozen
hobbies
his
study
as
a
place
where
these
hobbies
formed
strata
of
exciting
products
awakening
youthful
covetousness
in
the
matter
of
a
new
satisfying
youthful
imagination
by
the
production
of
a
his
character
serene
and
humorous
as
his
son
describes
him
is
reflected
in
his
letters
edward
chesterton
did
not
use
up
his
mental
powers
in
the
family
business
taught
by
his
father
to
be
a
good
man
of
business
he
was
in
his
private
life
a
man
of
a
thousand
other
energies
and
ideas
on
the
whole
says
his
son
i
am
glad
he
was
never
an
artist
it
might
have
stood
in
his
way
in
becoming
an
amateur
it
might
have
spoilt
his
career
his
private
career
he
could
never
have
made
a
vulgar
success
of
all
the
thousand
things
be
did
so
successfully
here
gilbert
sees
a
marked
distinction
between
that
generation
of
business
men
and
the
present
in
the
use
of
leisure
he
sees
hobbies
as
superior
to
sport
the
englishman
like
my
father
sold
houses
for
his
living
but
filled
his
own
house
with
his
life
a
hobby
is
not
merely
a
holiday
it
is
not
merely
exercising
the
body
instead
of
the
mind
an
excellent
but
now
largely
a
recognised
thing
it
is
exercising
the
rest
of
the
mind
now
an
almost
neglected
thing
edward
chesterton
practised
painting
and
modelling
and
photography
and
stained
glass
and
fretwork
and
magic
lanterns
and
mediaeval
illumination
and
moreover
knew
all
his
english
literature
backwards
it
has
become
of
late
the
fashion
for
any
one
who
writes
of
his
own
life
to
see
himself
against
a
dark
background
to
see
his
development
frustrated
by
some
shadow
of
heredity
or
some
horror
of
environment
but
gilbert
saw
his
life
rather
as
the
ancients
saw
it
when
was
a
duty
because
we
had
received
so
much
from
those
who
brought
us
into
being
this
englishman
was
grateful
to
his
country
to
his
parents
to
his
home
for
all
that
they
had
given
him
i
regret
that
i
have
no
gloomy
and
savage
father
to
offer
to
the
public
gaze
as
the
true
cause
of
all
my
tragic
heritage
no
and
partially
poisoned
mother
whose
suicidal
instincts
have
cursed
me
with
the
temptations
of
the
artistic
temperament
i
regret
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
range
of
our
family
much
more
racy
than
a
remote
and
mildly
impecunious
uncle
and
that
i
can
not
do
my
duty
as
a
true
modern
by
cursing
everybody
who
made
me
whatever
i
am
i
am
not
clear
about
what
that
is
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
most
of
it
is
my
own
fault
and
i
am
compelled
to
confess
that
i
look
back
to
that
landscape
of
my
first
days
with
a
pleasure
that
should
doubtless
be
reserved
for
the
utopias
of
the
futurist
chesterton
pp
chapter
ii
childhood
gilbert
keith
chesterton
was
born
on
may
at
a
house
in
sheffield
terrace
campden
hill
just
below
the
great
tower
of
the
waterworks
which
so
much
impressed
his
childish
imagination
lower
down
the
hill
was
the
anglican
church
of
george
and
here
he
was
baptised
when
he
was
about
five
the
family
moved
to
warwick
gardens
as
london
houses
go
warwick
gardens
is
small
on
the
ground
floor
a
back
and
front
room
were
for
the
chestertons
and
with
a
folding
door
between
the
only
other
being
a
small
study
built
out
over
the
garden
a
long
narrow
green
strip
which
must
have
been
a
good
deal
longer
before
a
row
of
garages
was
built
at
the
back
was
playground
his
bedroom
was
a
long
room
at
the
top
of
a
not
very
high
house
for
what
is
in
most
london
houses
the
floor
is
in
this
house
filled
by
two
bedrooms
and
there
is
only
one
floor
above
it
cecil
was
five
years
younger
than
gilbert
who
welcomed
his
birth
with
the
remark
now
i
shall
always
have
an
audience
a
prophecy
remembered
by
all
parties
because
it
proved
so
singularly
false
as
soon
as
cecil
could
speak
he
began
to
argue
and
the
intercourse
thenceforward
consisted
of
unending
discussion
they
always
argued
they
never
quarrelled
there
was
also
a
little
sister
beatrice
who
died
when
gilbert
was
very
young
so
young
that
he
remembered
a
fall
she
had
from
a
more
clearly
than
he
remembered
her
death
and
in
his
memory
linked
with
the
fall
the
sense
of
loss
and
sorrow
that
came
with
the
death
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
the
story
of
his
childhood
one
half
so
well
as
he
has
told
it
himself
it
is
the
best
part
of
his
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
best
childhoods
in
literature
for
gilbert
chesterton
most
perfectly
remembered
the
exact
truth
not
only
about
what
happened
to
a
child
but
about
how
a
child
thought
and
felt
what
is
more
he
sees
childhood
not
as
an
isolated
fragment
or
an
excursion
into
fairyland
but
as
his
real
life
the
real
beginnings
of
what
should
have
been
a
more
real
life
a
lost
experience
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
was
subconsciously
certain
then
as
i
am
consciously
certain
now
that
there
was
the
white
and
solid
road
and
the
worthy
beginning
of
the
life
of
man
and
that
it
is
man
who
afterwards
darkens
it
with
dreams
or
goes
astray
from
it
in
it
is
only
the
grown
man
who
lives
a
life
of
and
pretending
and
it
is
he
who
has
his
head
in
a
cloud
p
here
are
the
beginnings
of
the
man
philosophy
in
the
life
and
experience
of
the
child
he
was
living
in
a
world
of
reality
and
that
reality
was
beautiful
in
the
clear
light
of
an
eternal
morning
which
had
a
sort
of
wonder
in
it
as
if
the
world
were
as
new
as
myself
a
child
in
this
world
like
god
in
the
moment
of
creation
looks
upon
it
and
sees
that
it
is
very
good
it
was
not
that
he
was
never
unhappy
as
a
child
and
he
had
his
share
of
bodily
pain
i
had
a
fair
amount
of
toothache
and
especially
earache
but
the
child
has
his
own
philosophy
and
makes
his
own
proportion
and
unhappiness
and
pain
are
of
a
different
texture
or
held
on
a
different
tenure
what
was
wonderful
about
childhood
is
that
anything
in
it
was
a
wonder
it
was
not
merely
a
world
full
of
miracles
it
was
a
miraculous
world
what
gives
me
this
shock
is
almost
anything
i
really
recall
not
the
things
i
should
think
most
worth
recalling
this
is
where
it
differs
from
the
other
great
thrill
of
the
past
all
that
is
connected
with
first
love
and
the
romantic
passion
for
that
though
equally
poignant
comes
always
to
a
point
and
is
narrow
like
a
rapier
piercing
the
heart
whereas
the
other
was
more
like
a
hundred
windows
opened
on
all
sides
of
the
head
pp
these
windows
opening
on
all
sides
so
much
more
swiftly
for
the
genius
than
for
the
rest
of
us
led
to
a
result
often
to
be
noted
in
the
childhood
of
exceptional
men
a
combination
of
backwardness
and
precocity
gilbert
chesterton
was
in
some
ways
a
very
backward
child
he
did
not
talk
much
before
three
he
learnt
to
read
only
at
eight
he
loved
fairy
tales
as
a
child
he
read
them
or
had
them
read
aloud
to
him
as
a
big
boy
he
wrote
and
illustrated
a
good
many
some
of
which
are
printed
in
coloured
i
have
found
several
fragments
in
praise
of
hans
andersen
written
apparently
in
his
schooldays
in
the
chapter
of
called
the
ethics
of
elfland
he
shows
how
the
truth
about
goodness
and
happiness
came
to
him
out
of
the
old
fairy
tales
and
made
the
first
basis
for
his
philosophy
and
george
macdonald
story
princess
and
the
made
he
says
a
difference
to
my
whole
existence
which
helped
me
to
see
things
in
a
certain
way
from
the
start
it
is
the
story
of
a
house
where
goblins
were
in
the
cellar
and
a
kind
of
fairy
godmother
in
a
hidden
room
upstairs
this
story
had
made
all
the
ordinary
staircases
and
doors
and
windows
into
magical
things
it
was
the
awakening
of
the
sense
of
wonder
and
joy
in
the
ordinary
things
always
to
be
his
still
more
important
was
the
realization
represented
by
the
goblins
below
stairs
that
when
the
evil
things
besieging
us
do
appear
they
do
not
appear
outside
but
inside
in
life
as
in
this
story
there
is
a
house
that
is
our
home
that
is
rightly
loved
as
our
home
but
of
which
we
hardly
know
the
best
or
the
worst
and
must
always
wait
for
the
one
and
watch
against
the
other
since
i
first
read
that
story
some
five
alternative
philosophies
of
the
universe
have
come
to
our
colleges
out
of
germany
blowing
through
the
world
like
the
east
wind
but
for
me
that
castle
is
still
standing
in
the
mountains
its
light
is
not
put
out
introduction
to
macdonald
and
his
all
this
to
gilbert
made
the
story
the
most
real
the
most
realistic
in
the
exact
sense
of
the
phrase
the
most
like
life
of
any
story
he
ever
read
then
or
later
another
recurrent
image
in
books
by
the
same
author
is
that
of
a
great
white
horse
and
gilbert
says
to
this
day
i
can
never
see
a
big
white
horse
in
the
street
without
a
sudden
sense
of
indescribable
things
ibid
of
his
playmates
one
of
my
first
memories
he
writes
in
the
is
playing
in
the
garden
under
the
care
of
a
girl
with
ropes
of
golden
hair
to
whom
my
mother
afterwards
called
out
from
the
house
are
an
angel
which
i
was
disposed
to
accept
without
metaphor
she
is
now
living
in
vancouver
as
robert
kidd
kidd
then
annie
firmin
was
the
daughter
of
a
girlhood
friend
of
chesterton
she
called
her
aunt
marie
she
and
her
sister
gilbert
says
in
the
had
more
to
do
with
enlivening
my
early
years
than
most
she
has
a
vivid
memory
of
sheffield
terrace
where
all
three
chesterton
children
were
born
and
where
the
little
sister
beatrice
whom
they
called
birdie
died
gilbert
in
those
days
was
called
diddie
his
father
then
and
later
was
ed
to
the
family
and
intimate
friends
soon
after
death
they
moved
to
warwick
gardens
kidd
writes
the
little
boys
were
never
allowed
to
see
a
funeral
if
one
passed
down
warwick
gardens
they
were
hustled
from
the
nursery
window
at
once
possibly
this
was
because
gilbert
had
such
a
fear
of
sickness
or
accident
if
cecil
gave
the
slightest
sign
of
choking
at
dinner
gilbert
would
throw
down
his
spoon
or
fork
and
rush
from
the
room
i
have
seen
him
do
it
so
many
times
cecil
was
fond
of
animals
gilbert
was
cecil
had
a
cat
that
he
named
faustine
because
he
wanted
her
to
be
abandoned
and
wicked
but
faustine
turned
out
to
be
a
gentleman
gilbert
and
began
very
early
but
not
i
think
in
great
abundance
his
drawing
even
earlier
and
of
this
there
is
a
great
deal
there
is
nothing
very
striking
in
the
written
fragments
that
remain
but
his
drawings
even
at
the
age
of
five
are
full
of
vigour
the
faces
and
figures
are
always
rudimentary
human
beings
sometimes
a
good
deal
more
and
they
are
taken
through
lengthy
adventures
drawn
on
the
backs
of
bits
of
wall
paper
of
insurance
forms
in
little
books
sewn
together
or
sometimes
on
long
strips
glued
end
to
end
by
his
father
these
drawings
can
often
be
dated
exactly
for
edward
chesterton
who
later
kept
collections
of
and
photographs
of
his
son
had
already
begun
to
collect
his
drawings
writing
the
date
on
the
back
of
each
with
the
earlier
ones
he
may
one
sometimes
suspects
have
helped
a
little
but
it
soon
becomes
easy
to
distinguish
between
the
two
styles
edward
chesterton
was
the
most
perfect
father
that
could
have
been
imagined
to
help
in
the
opening
of
windows
on
every
side
my
father
might
have
reminded
people
of
pickwick
except
that
he
was
always
bearded
and
never
bald
he
wore
spectacles
and
had
all
the
pickwickian
evenness
of
temper
and
pleasure
in
the
humours
of
travel
he
had
as
his
son
further
notes
in
the
a
power
of
invention
which
created
for
children
the
permanent
anticipation
of
what
is
profoundly
called
a
the
child
of
today
chooses
his
christmas
present
in
advance
and
decides
between
peter
pan
and
the
pantomime
when
he
does
not
get
both
the
chesterton
children
saw
their
first
glimpses
of
fantasy
through
the
framework
of
a
of
which
their
father
was
carpenter
and
author
and
creator
of
actors
and
actresses
a
few
inches
high
gilbert
earliest
recollection
is
of
one
of
these
figures
in
a
golden
crown
carrying
a
golden
key
and
his
father
was
all
through
his
childhood
a
man
with
a
golden
key
who
admitted
him
into
a
world
of
wonders
i
think
gilbert
father
meant
more
to
him
than
his
mother
fond
as
he
was
of
her
most
of
their
friends
seem
to
feel
that
cecil
was
her
favorite
son
neither
was
ever
demonstrative
annie
firmin
says
i
never
saw
either
of
them
kiss
his
mother
but
in
some
ways
the
mother
spoilt
both
boys
they
had
not
the
training
that
a
strict
mother
or
an
efficient
nurse
usually
accomplishes
with
the
most
refractory
gilbert
was
never
refractory
merely
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
was
sent
upstairs
to
wash
his
hands
or
brush
his
hair
except
in
preparation
for
a
visit
or
ceremonial
occasion
not
even
then
interpolates
annie
and
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
he
ought
to
have
been
so
sent
several
times
a
day
no
one
minded
if
he
was
late
for
meals
his
father
too
was
frequently
late
and
frances
during
her
engagement
often
saw
his
mother
put
the
dishes
down
in
the
fireplace
to
keep
hot
and
wait
patiently
in
spite
of
gilbert
description
of
her
as
more
swift
relentless
and
generally
radical
in
her
instincts
than
his
father
annie
earlier
memories
fit
this
description
better
much
as
she
loved
her
aunt
she
writes
aunt
marie
was
a
bit
of
a
tyrant
in
her
own
family
i
have
been
many
times
at
dinner
when
there
might
be
a
joint
say
and
a
chicken
and
she
would
say
positively
to
ed
which
will
you
have
edward
edward
i
think
i
like
a
bit
of
chicken
aunt
fiercely
no
you
wo
you
have
mutton
that
happened
so
often
sometimes
alice
grosjean
the
youngest
of
aunt
family
familiarly
known
as
sloper
was
there
when
asked
her
preference
she
would
say
diffidently
i
think
i
take
a
little
mutton
do
be
a
fool
alice
you
know
you
like
chicken
and
chicken
she
got
visitors
to
the
house
in
later
years
dwell
on
immense
spirit
of
hospitality
the
gargantuan
meals
the
eager
desire
that
guests
should
eat
enormously
and
the
wittiness
of
her
conversation
schoolboy
contemporaries
of
gilbert
say
that
although
immensely
kind
she
alarmed
them
by
a
rather
forbidding
appearance
her
clothes
thrown
on
anyhow
and
blackened
and
protruding
teeth
which
gave
her
a
witchlike
appearance
the
house
too
was
dusty
and
untidy
she
called
them
always
by
their
surnames
both
when
they
were
little
boys
and
after
they
grew
up
oldershaw
bentley
solomon
not
only
says
miss
may
chesterton
did
aunt
marie
address
gilbert
friends
by
their
surnames
but
frequently
added
darling
to
them
i
have
heard
her
address
bentley
when
a
young
man
thus
darling
come
and
sit
over
here
to
which
invitation
he
turned
a
completely
deaf
ear
as
he
was
perfectly
content
to
remain
where
he
was
indiscriminately
she
also
addressed
her
maids
waiting
at
table
with
the
same
endearment
a
letter
written
when
gilbert
was
only
six
would
seem
to
show
that
chesterton
had
not
yet
become
so
reckless
about
her
appearance
and
was
still
open
to
the
appeal
of
millinery
she
always
was
says
annie
the
letter
is
from
john
barker
of
high
street
kensington

is

annie

that
ed
married
her
for
her
beautiful
hair
it
was
auburn
and
very
long
and
wavy
he
used
to
sit
behind
her
in

she
liked
pretty
clothes
but
lacked
the
vanity
to
buy
them
for
herself

her
one
day

twenties

had
played
with
him

in

rather
gardens
as
ourselves
and
were
amusing
as
bringing
one
within

of
what
an
old
friend
of
mine
named
bentley
called
with
more
than
his
usual
gloom
and
severity
of
expression
the
remote
outpost
of
kensington
society
for
these
reasons
and
a
great
many
much
better
ones
i
was
very
much
elated
to
have
the
family
or
at
least
the
three
eldest
girls
who
represent
it
to
the
neighbourhood
standing
once
more
on
the
lawn
of
our
old
garden
where
some
of
my
earliest
recollections
were
of
subjecting
them
to
treatment
such
as
i
considered
appropriate
to
my
own
character
of
robber
tying
them
to
trees
to
the
prejudice
of
their
white
frocks
and
otherwise
misbehaving
myself
in
the
funny
old
days
before
i
went
to
school
and
became
a
son
of
gentlemen
only
i
have
never
been
able
in
fact
i
have
never
tried
to
tell
which
of
the
three
i
really
liked
best
and
if
the
severer
usefulness
and
domesticity
of
the
eldest
girl
with
her
quiet
and
broad
brave
forehead
as
pale
as
the
white
roses
that
clouded
the
garden
if
these
maturer
qualities
in
nina
demanded
my
respect
more
than
the
levity
of
the
others
i
fear
they
did
not
prevent
me
feeling
an
almost
equal
tide
of
affection
towards
the
sleepy
acumen
and
ingrained
sense
of
humour
of
ida
the
second
girl

for
the

veritably
delightful
child

temper

formless
and

what
old
memories
this
garden
calls
up
said
nina
who
like
many
essentially
simple
and
direct
people
had
a
strong
dash
of
sentiment
and
a
strong
penchant
for
being
her
own
emotional
on
the
traditional
subjects
and
occasions
i
remember
so
well
coming
here
in
a
new
pink
frock
when
i
was
a
little
girl
it
was
so
new
when
i
went
away
i
certainly
must
have
been
a
brute
i
replied
but
i
have
endeavoured
to
make
a
lifetime
atone
for
my
early
conduct
and
i
fell
to
thinking
how
even
nina
miracle
of
diligence
and
remembered
a
new
pink
frock
across
the
abyss
of
the
years
walking
with
my
old
friends

in

unpublished
fragment
edward
chesterton
was
a
liberal
politically
and
what
has
been
called
a
liberal
christian
religiously
when
the
family
went
to
church
which
happened
very
seldom
it
was
to
listen
to
the
sermons
of
stopford
brooke
some
twenty
years
later
cecil
was
to
remark
with
amusement
that
he
had
as
a
small
boy
heard
every
part
of
the
teaching
now
being
set
out
by
campbell
under
the
title
the
new
religion
the
chesterton
liberalism
entered
into
the
view
of
history
given
to
their
children
and
it
produced
from
gilbert
the
only
poem
of
his
childhood
worth
quoting
i
can
not
date
it
but
the
very
immature
handwriting
and
curious
spelling
mark
it
as
early
probably
most
children
have
read
or
at
any
rate
up
to
my
own
generation
had
read
aytoun
of
the
scottish
and
played
at
being
cavaliers
as
a
result
but
gilbert
could
not
play
at
being
a
cavalier
he
had
learned
from
his
father
to
be
a
roundhead
as
had
every
good
liberal
of
that
day
what
was
to
be
done
about
it
he
took
the
and
rewrote
them
in
an
excellent
imitation
of
aytoun
but
on
the
opposite
side
in
view
of
his
own
later
developments
such
a
line
as
drive
the
trembling
papists
backwards
has
an
ironic
humour
but
one
wonders
what
aytoun
himself
would
have
made
of
a
small
boy
who
took
his
rhythm
and
sometimes
his
very
words
turned
his
hero
into
a
traitor
false

his
traitor
argyll

school
days
curiously
enough
gilbert
does
not
in
the
speak
of
any
school
except
paul
he
went
however
first
to
colet
court
usually
called
at
that
time
bewsher
from
the
name
of
the
headmaster
though
it
is
not
technically
the
preparatory
school
for
paul
large
numbers
of
paulines
do
pass
through
it
it
stands
opposite
paul
in
the
hammersmith
road
and
must
have
been
felt
by
gilbert
as
one
thing
with
his
main
school
experience
for
he
nowhere
differentiates
between
the
two
paul
school
is
an
old
city
foundation
which
has
had
among
its
scholars
milton
and
marlborough
pepys
and
sir
philip
francis
and
a
host
of
other
distinguished
men
the
editor
of
a
correspondence
column
wrote
a
good
many
years
later
in
answer
to
an
enquirer
yes
milton
and
chesterton
were
both
educated
at
paul
school
we
fancy
however
that
milton
had
left
before
chesterton
entered
the
school
in
an
early
life
of
sir
thomas
more
we
learn
of
the
keen
rivalry
existing
in
his
day
between
his
own
school
of
anthony
and
paul
of
scholastic
disputations
between
the
two
put
an
end
to
by
dean
colet
because
they
led
to
brawling
among
the
boys
when
the
paulines
would
call
those
of
anthony
pigs
and
the
pigs
would
call
the
paulines
pigeons
from
the
pigeons
of
cathedral
now
however
anthony
is
no
more
and
school
has
long
moved
to
the
suburbs
and
lies
about
seven
walk
along
the
hammersmith
road
from
warwick
gardens
gilbert
chesterton
was
twelve
when
he
entered
paul
in
january
and
he
was
placed
in
the
second
form
his
early
days
at
school
were
very
solitary
his
chief
occupation
being
to
draw
all
over
his
books
he
drew
caricatures
of
his
masters
he
drew
scenes
from
shakespeare
he
drew
prominent
politicians
he
did
not
at
first
make
many
friends
in
the
he
makes
a
sharp
distinction
between
being
a
child
and
being
a
boy
but
it
is
a
distinction
that
could
only
be
drawn
by
a
man
and
most
men
i
fancy
would
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
say
at
what
moment
the
transformation
occurred
seems
to
put
it
at
the
beginning
of
school
life
but
the
fact
that
paul
was
a
meant
that
the
transition
from
home
to
school
usual
in
english
education
was
never
in
his
case
completely
made
no
doubt
he
is
right
in
speaking
in
the
of
the
sort
of
prickly
protection
like
hair
that
grows
over
what
was
once
the
child
of
the
fact
that
schoolboys
in
his
time
could
be
blasted
with
the
horrible
revelation
of
having
a
sister
or
even
a
christian
name
nevertheless
he
went
home
every
evening
to
a
father
and
mother
and
small
brother
he
went
to
his
friends
houses
and
knew
their
sisters
school
and
home
life
met
daily
instead
of
being
sharply
divided
into
terms
and
holidays
the
terminology
for
english
schools
came
into
being
largely
before
the
state
concerned
itself
with
education
a
private
school
is
one
run
by
an
individual
or
a
group
for
private
profit
a
public
school
is
not
run
for
private
profit
any
profits
there
may
be
are
put
back
into
the
school
mostly
they
are
run
by
a
board
of
governors
and
very
many
of
them
hold
the
succession
to
the
old
monastic
schools
of
england
charterhouse
westminster
paul
they
are
usually
though
not
necessarily
boarding
schools
and
the
fees
are
usually
high
elementary
schools
called
board
schools
were
paid
for
out
of
local
rates
and
run
by
elected
school
boards
they
were
later
replaced
by
schools
run
by
the
county
councils
this
fact
was
of
immense
significance
in
gilbert
development
years
later
he
noted
as
the
chief
defect
of
oxford
that
it
consisted
almost
entirely
of
people
educated
at
for
good
for
evil
or
for
both
a
boy
at
a
is
educated
chiefly
at
home
in
the
atmosphere
of
paul
is
found
little
echo
of
the
dogma
of
the
head
master
of
christ
hospital
boy
the
school
is
your
father
boy
the
school
is
your
mother
nor
as
far
as
we
know
has
any
pauline
been
known
to
desire
the
substitution
of
the
august
abstraction
for
the
guardianship
of
his
own
people
friendships
formed
in
this
school
have
a
continual
reference
to
home
life
nor
can
a
boy
possibly
have
a
friend
long
without
making
the
acquaintance
and
feeling
the
influence
of
his
parents
and
his
surroundings
the
boys
own
amusements
and
institutions
the
school
sports
the
school
clubs
the
school
magazine
are
patronised
by
the
masters
but
they
are
originated
and
managed
by
the
boys
the
of
the
boys
are
left
to
their
several
pleasures
whether
physical
or
intellectual
nor
have
any
foolish
observations
about
the
battle
of
waterloo
being
won
on
the
or
such
rather
unmeaning
oracles
yet
succeeded
in
converting
the
boys
amusements
into
a
compulsory
gymnastic
lesson
the
boys
are
within
reasonable
limits
free
of
written
about
gilbert
calls
the
chapter
on
his
school
days
how
to
be
a
dunce
and
although
in
mature
life
he
was
on
the
side
of
his
masters
and
grateful
to
them
that
my
persistent
efforts
not
to
learn
latin
were
frustrated
and
that
i
was
not
entirely
successful
even
in
escaping
the
contamination
of
the
language
of
aristotle
and
demosthenes
he
still
contrasts
childhood
as
a
time
when
one
wants
to
know
nearly
everything
with
the
period
of
what
is
commonly
called
education
that
is
the
period
during
which
i
was
being
instructed
by
somebody
i
did
not
know
about
something
i
did
not
want
to
know
the
boy
who
sat
next
to
him
in
class
lawrence
solomon
later
senior
tutor
of
university
college
london
remembered
him
as
sleepy
and
indifferent
in
manner
but
able
to
master
anything
when
he
cared
to
take
the
trouble
as
he
very
seldom
did
he
was
in
a
class
with
boys
almost
all
his
juniors
lucian
oldershaw
who
later
became
his
says
of
gilbert
own
description
of
his
school
life
that
it
was
as
near
a
pose
as
gilbert
ever
managed
to
get
he
wanted
desperately
to
be
the
ordinary
schoolboy
but
he
never
managed
to
fulfil
this
ambition
tall
untidy
incredibly
clumsy
and
he
was
marked
out
from
his
fellows
both
physically
and
intellectually
when
in
the
later
part
of
his
school
life
some
sort
of
physical
exercises
were
made
compulsory
the
boys
used
to
form
parties
to
watch
his
strange
efforts
on
the
trapeze
or
parallel
bars
in
these
early
days
he
was
he
says
of
himself
somewhat
solitary
but
not
unhappy
and
perfectly
about
the
tricks
which
were
inevitably
played
on
a
boy
who
always
appeared
to
be
half
asleep
he
sat
at
the
back
of
the
room
says
fordham
and
never
distinguished
himself
we
thought
him
the
most
curious
thing
that
ever
was
his
schoolfellows
noted
how
he
would
stride
along
apparently
muttering
poetry
breaking
into
inane
laughter
the
kind
of
thing
he
was
muttering
we
learn
from
a
sentence
in
the
i
was
one
day
wandering
about
the
streets
in
that
part
of
north
kensington
telling
myself
stories
of
feudal
sallies
and
sieges
in
the
manner
of
walter
scott
and
vaguely
trying
to
apply
them
to
the
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
around
me
i
can
see
him
now
wrote
fordham
very
tall
and
lanky
striding
untidily
along
kensington
high
street
smiling
and
sometimes
scowling
as
he
talked
to
himself
apparently
oblivious
of
everything
he
passed
but
in
reality
a
far
closer
observer
than
most
and
one
who
not
only
observed
but
remembered
what
he
had
seen
it
was
only
of
himself
that
he
was
really
oblivious
oldershaw
remembers
that
on
one
occasion
on
a
very
cold
day
they
filled
his
pockets
with
snow
in
the
playground
when
class
reassembled
the
snow
began
to
melt
and
pools
to
appear
on
the
floor
a
small
boy
raised
his
hand
please
sir
i
think
the
laboratory
sink
must
be
leaking
again
the
water
is
coming
through
and
falling
all
over
chesterton
the
laboratory
sink
was
an
old
offender
and
the
master
must
have
been
chesterton
he
said
go
up
to
and
ask
him
with
my
compliments
to
see
that
the
trouble
with
the
sink
is
put
right
immediately
gilbert
with
water
still
streaming
from
both
pockets
obediently
went
upstairs
gave
the
message
and
returned
without
discovering
what
had
happened
the
boys
who
played
these
jokes
on
him
had
at
the
same
time
an
extraordinary
respect
both
for
his
intellectual
acquirements
and
for
his
moral
character
one
boy
who
rather
prided
himself
in
private
life
on
being
a
man
about
town
stopped
him
one
day
in
the
passage
and
said
solemnly
chesterton
i
am
an
abandoned
profligate
replied
i
sorry
to
hear
it
we
watched
our
talk
one
of
them
said
to
me
when
he
was
with
us
his
home
and
upbringing
were
felt
by
some
of
his
schoolfellows
to
have
definitely
a
puritan
tinge
about
them
although
on
the
other
hand
the
more
conservative
elements
regarded
them
as
politically
dangerous
oldershaw
relates
that
his
own
father
who
was
a
conservative
in
politics
and
had
also
joined
the
catholic
church
seriously
warned
him
against
the
agnosticism
and
republicanism
of
the
chesterton
household
but
even
at
this
age
his
schoolfellows
recognised
that
he
had
begun
the
great
quest
of
his
life
we
felt
said
oldershaw
that
he
was
looking
for
god
i
suppose
it
was
in
part
the
keenness
of
the
inner
vision
that
produced
the
effect
of
external
sleepiness
and
made
it
possible
to
pack
gilbert
pockets
with
snow
but
it
was
also
the
fact
that
he
was
observing
very
keenly
the
kind
of
thing
that
other
people
do
not
bother
to
observe
i
remember
my
mother
telling
me
when
i
first
came
out
that
she
had
almost
ceased
trying
to
draw
people
characters
and
imaginatively
construct
their
home
lives
because
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
trying
to
notice
how
they
were
dressed
she
was
not
noticeably
successful
gilbert
chesterton
never
even
tried
to
see
what
everyone
else
saw
all
the
time
he
was
seeing
qualities
in
his
friends
ideas
in
literature
and
possibilities
in
life
and
all
this
world
of
imagination
had
on
his
own
theory
to
be
carefully
concealed
from
his
masters
in
the
he
describes
himself
walking
to
school
fervently
reciting
verses
which
he
afterwards
repeated
in
class
with
a
determined
lack
of
expression
and
woodenness
of
voice
but
when
he
assumes
that
this
is
how
all
boys
behave
he
surely
attributes
his
own
literary
enthusiasms
far
too
widely
one
would
rather
gather
that
he
supposed
the
whole
of
paul
school
to
be
in
the
conspiracy
to
conceal
their
love
of
literature
from
their
masters
such
of
his
own
schoolboy
papers
as
can
be
found
show
an
imagination
rare
enough
at
any
age
and
an
enthusiasm
not
commonly
to
be
found
among
schoolboys
a
very
early
one
to
judge
by
the
handwriting
is
on
the
advantages
for
an
historical
character
of
having
long
hair
illustrated
by
the
history
of
mary
queen
of
scots
and
charles
the
first
in
the
contrast
he
draws
between
mary
and
elizabeth
appear
qualities
of
historical
imagination
that
might
well
belong
to
a
mature
and
experienced
writer
as
in
the
cause
of
the
fleeting
heartless
helen
the
trojan
war
is
stirred
up
and
great
ajax
perishes
and
the
gentle
patroclus
is
slain
and
mighty
hector
falls
and
godlike
achilles
is
laid
low
and
the
dun
plains
of
hades
are
thickened
with
the
shades
of
kings
so
round
this
lovely
giddy
french
princess
fall
one
by
one
the
haughty
dauphin
the
princely
darnley
the
accomplished
rizzio
the
terrible
bothwell
and
when
she
dies
she
dies
as
a
martyr
before
the
weeping
eyes
of
thousands
and
is
given
a
popular
pity
and
regret
denied
to
her
rival
with
all
her
faults
of
violence
and
vanity
a
greater
and
a
purer
woman
it
must
indeed
have
been
a
terrible
scene
the
execution
of
that
unhappy
queen
and
it
is
a
scene
that
has
been
described
by
too
many
and
too
able
writers
for
me
to
venture
on
a
picture
of
it
but
the
continually
lamented
death
of
mary
of
scotland
seems
to
me
happy
compared
with
the
end
of
her
greater
and
sterner
rival
as
i
think
on
the
two
the
vision
of
the
black
scaffold
the
grim
headsman
the
serene
captive
and
the
weeping
populace
fades
from
me
and
is
replaced
by
a
sadder
vision
the
vision
of
the
of
whitehall
elizabeth
haggard
and
has
flung
herself
prone
upon
the
floor
and
refuses
to
take
meat
or
drink
but
lies
there
surrounded
by
ceremonious
courtiers
but
seeing
with
that
terrible
insight
that
was
her
curse
that
she
was
alone
that
their
homage
was
a
mockery
that
they
were
waiting
eagerly
for
her
death
to
crown
their
intrigues
with
her
successor
that
there
was
not
in
the
whole
world
a
single
being
who
cared
for
her
seeing
all
this
and
bearing
it
with
the
iron
fortitude
of
her
race
but
underneath
that
invincible
silence
the
deep
woman
nature
crying
out
with
a
bitter
cry
that
she
is
loved
no
longer
thus
gnawed
by
the
fangs
of
a
dead
vanity
haunted
by
the
pale
ghost
of
essex
and
helpless
and
bitter
of
heart
the
greatest
of
englishwomen
passed
silently
away
of
a
truth
there
are
prisons
more
gloomy
than
fotheringay
and
deaths
more
cruel
than
the
axe
is
there
no
pity
due
to
those
who
undergo
these
it
is
surprising
to
read
the
series
of
form
reports
written
on
a
boy
who
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
could
do
work
of
this
quality
here
are
the
reports
made
by
his
form
masters
from
his
first
year
in
the
school
at
the
age
of
thirteen
to
the
time
he
left
at
the
age
of
eighteen
too
much
for
me
means
well
by
me
i
believe
but
has
an
inconceivable
knack
of
forgetting
at
the
shortest
notice
is
consequently
always
in
trouble
though
some
of
his
work
is
well
done
when
he
does
remember
to
do
it
he
ought
to
be
in
a
studio
not
at
school
never
troublesome
but
for
his
lack
of
memory
and
absence
of
mind
wildly
inaccurate
about
everything
never
thinks
for
two
consecutive
moments
to
judge
by
his
work
plenty
of
ability
perhaps
in
other
directions
than
classics
fair
improving
in
neatness
has
a
very
fair
stock
of
general
knowledge
a
great
blunderer
with
much
intelligence
means
well
would
do
better
to
give
his
time
to
modern
subjects
can
get
up
any
work
but
originates
nothing
takes
an
interest
in
his
english
work
but
otherwise
has
not
done
well
he
has
a
decided
literary
aptitude
but
does
not
trouble
himself
enough
about
school
work
report
not
on
the
same
plane
with
the
rest
composition
quite
futile
but
will
translate
well
and
appreciate
what
he
reads
not
a
quick
brain
but
possessed
by
a
slowly
moving
tortuous
imagination
conduct
always
admirable
what
is
much
clearer
from
the
mass
of
notebooks
and
odd
sheets
of
paper
belonging
to
these
years
than
from
the
is
the
degree
to
which
the
two
processes
of
resisting
and
absorbing
knowledge
were
going
on
simultaneously
at
school
he
was
he
says
asleep
but
dreaming
in
his
sleep
at
home
he
was
still
learning
literature
from
his
father
going
to
museums
and
picture
galleries
for
enjoyment
listening
to
political
talk
and
engaging
in
arguments
writing
historical
plays
and
acting
them
and
above
all
drawing
to
most
of
his
early
writing
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
affix
a
date
with
the
exception
of
a
dramatic
journal
kept
by
fits
and
starts
during
the
christmas
holidays
when
he
was
sixteen
solemnly
tells
the
reader
of
this
diary
to
take
warning
by
it
to
beware
of
prolixity
and
it
does
in
fact
contain
many
more
words
to
many
fewer
ideas
than
any
of
his
later
writings
but
it
is
useful
in
giving
the
atmosphere
of
those
years
great
part
is
in
dialogue

it
is
interesting
to
note
already
faint
foreshadowings
of
gilbert
future
political
views
his
parents
had
made
him
a
liberal
but
it
seemed
to
him
later
as
he
notes
in
the
that
their
generation
was
insufficiently
alive
to
the
condition
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
in
so
many
matters
they
were
not
looking
in
that
particular
direction
and
so
it
was
only
very
gradually
that
he
himself
began
to
look

but
which
the

candidly
avowed
that
he
did
not
like
part
and
parcel
of
oldershaw
optimism
is
a
desire
not
to
believe
in
pictures
of
real
misery
and
a
desire
to
find
out
compensating
pleasures
i
think
there
was
a
good
deal
in
what
he
said
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
there
is
real
misery
physical
and
mental
in
the
low
and
criminal
classes
and
i
do
believe
in

the

seems
certainly
at

to

living
in
a
land
in
which
is
always
afternoon
in
one
house
or
another
goes
on
until
signs
of
dinner
make
their
appearance
the
boys
only
move
from

or
adjourn
to
their
own
bedrooms
where
gilbert
piles
book
on
book
and
reduces
even
neat
shelves
to
the
same
chaos
that
reigns
in
his
own
room
the
christmas
holidays
to
which
the
dramatic
journal
belongs
came
a
few
months
after
the
founding
of
the
junior
debating
club
which
became
so
central
in
gilbert
life
and
which
he
treated
with
a
gravity
solemnity
even
such
as
he
never
showed
later
for
any
cause
a
gravity
untouched
by
humour
it
was
a
group
of
about
a
dozen
boys
started
with
the
idea
that
it
should
be
a
shakespeare
club
but
immediately
changed
into
a
general
discussion
club
they
met
every
week
at
the
home
of
one
or
other
and
after
a
hearty
tea
some
member
read
a
paper
which
was
then
debated
at
the
age
of
twenty
when
he
had
left
school
two
years
wrote
a
solemn
history
of
this
institution
in
which
the
question
of
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
to
insist
on
penny
fines
for
rowdy
behaviour
is
canvassed
with
passionate
feeling
one
boy
who
was
expelled
asked
to
be
readmitted
saying
i
feel
so
lonely
without
it
enthusiasm
over
this
incident
could
be
no
greater
had
he
been
a
bishop
welcoming
the
return
of
an
apostate
to
the
christian
fold
i
suppose
it
was
partly
because
of
his
early
solitary
life
at
school
partly
because
of
the
general
trend
of
his
thought
partly
that
at
this
later
date
he
was
under
the
influence
of
walt
whitman
and
cast
back
upon
his
earlier
years
a
sort
of
glow
or
haze
of
whitman
idealism
anyhow
the
junior
debating
club
became
to
him
a
symbol
of
the
ideal
friendship
they
were
knights
of
the
round
table
they
were
jongleurs
de
dieu
they
were
the
human
club
through
whom
and
in
whom
he
had
made
the
grand
discovery
of
man
they
were
his
youth
personified
the
note
is
still
struck
in
the
letters
of
his
engagement
period
and
it
was
only
forty
years
later
writing
his
that
he
was
able
to
picture
with
a
certain
humorous
detachment
this
group
of
boys
who
met
to
eat
buns
and
criticise
the
universe
a
year
after
their
first
meeting
the
energy
of
lucian
oldershaw
produced
a
magazine
called
at
first
it
was
turned
out
at
home
on
a
duplicator
the
efficiency
of
the
production
being
such
that
the
author
of
any
given
paper
was
able
occasionally
to
recognise
a
few
words
of
his
own
contribution
later
it
was
printed
and
gives
a
good
record
of
the
meetings
and
discussions
it
shows
the
energy
and
ardour
of
the
debaters
and
also
their
serious
view
of
themselves
and
their
efforts
at
first
they
are
described
as
c
f
etc
later
the
full
name
is
given
besides
the
weekly
debates
they
started
a
library
a
chess
club
a
naturalists
society
and
a
sketching
club
regular
meetings
of
which
are
chronicled
the
chairman
said
a
few
words
runs
a
record
after
some
months
of
existence
stating
his
pride
at
the
success
of
the
club
and
his
belief
in
the
good
effect
such
a
literary
institution
might
have
as
a
protest
against
the
lower
and
unworthy
phases
of
school
life
his
view
having
been
vehemently
corroborated
the
meeting
broke
up
in
one
fairly
typical
month
papers
were
read
on
three
comedies
of
shakespeare
pope
and
herodotus
and
when
no
paper
was
produced
there
was
a
discussion
on
capital
punishment
in
another
the
subjects
were
the
brontës
macaulay
as
an
essayist
frank
buckland
the
naturalist
and
tennyson
a
pretty
wide
range
of
reading
was
called
for
from
schoolboys
in
addition
to
their
ordinary
work
even
though
on
one
occasion
the
secretary
sternly
notes
that
the
reading
of
the
paper
occupied
only
three
and
minutes
but
they
were
not
daunted
by
difficulties
or
afraid
of
bold
attempts
digby
on
one
occasion
delivered
a
paper
entitled
nineteenth
century
a
retrospect
he
gave
a
slight
resumé
of
the
principal
events
with
appropriate
tribute
to
the
deceased
great
of
this
century
bertram
reading
a
paper
on
milton
dealt
critically
with
his
various
poems
noting
the
effective
style
of
giving
the
story
of
the
writing
of
and
cursorily
analysing
lost
and
regained
after
discussing
the
adaptability
of
to
the
stage
maurice
solomon
who
may
have
been
quite
fifteen
passed
on
to
review
the
chief
points
in
the
character
of
the
prince
of
denmark
concluding
with
a
slight
review
of
the
other
characters
which
he
did
not
think
shakespeare
had
given
much
attention
to
in
a
discussion
on
the
new
humorists
we
find
the
secretary
taking
grievous
umbrage
at
certain
unwarrantable
attacks
which
he
considered
andrew
lang
had
lately
made
on
these
choice
spirits
this
discussion
arose
from
a
paper
by
the
chairman
on
the
new
school
of
poetry
in
which
in
spite
of
its
good
points
he
condemned
the
absence
of
the
sentiment
of
the
moral
which
he
held
to
be
the
really
stirring
and
popular
element
in
literature
evidently
some
of
his
friends
tended
towards
a
youthful
cynicism
for
in
a
paper
on
barrie
in
gilbert
apologises
to
such
of
you
as
are
much
bitten
with
the
george
moore
state
of
mind
the
book
which
describes
the
rusty
emotions
and
toilsome
lives
of
the
thrums
weavers
will
always
remain
a
book
that
has
given
me
something
and
the
fact
that
mine
is
merely
the
popular
view
and
that
what
i
feel
in
it
can
be
equally
felt
by
the
majority
of
this
fact
such
is
my
hardened
and
abandoned
state
only
makes
me
like
the
book
more
i
have
long
found
myself
in
that
hopeless
minority
that
is
engaged
in
protecting
the
majority
of
mankind
from
the
attacks
of
all
men
in
this
sentiment
we
recognise
the
that
is
to
be
but
not
when
we
find
him
seconding
bentley
in
the
motion
that
a
scientific
education
is
much
more
useful
than
a
classic
m
reading
a
paper
on
herodotus
gave
a
minute
account
of
the
life
of
the
historian
dwelling
much
upon
the
doubt
and
controversy
surrounding
his
birth
and
several
incidents
of
his
history
while
read
a
paper
on
newspapers
tracing
their
growth
from
the
acta
diurna
of
the
later
roman
empire
to
the
hordes
of
papers
of
the
present
day
perhaps
best
of
all
these
efforts
was
that
of
mr
who
after
describing
the
governments
of
england
france
russia
germany
and
the
united
states
proceeded
to
give

would
have
done
anything

was

the
endless

the

hypocritical

ever
went
i
am
getting
old
how
old
it
will
shortly
be
necessary
for
me
to
state
precisely
for
as
you
doubtless
know
there
is
going
to
be

i
have
been
trying
to
knock
into
shape
a
story
such
as
we
spoke
about
the
other
day
about
the
first
introduction
of
tea
and
i
should
be
glad
of
your
assistance
and
suggestions
i
think
i
shall
lay
the
scene
in
holland
where
the
merits
of
tea
were
first
largely
agitated
and
fill
the
scene
with
the
traditional
dutch
figures
such
as
i
sketch
i
find
in
disraeli
curiosities
of
literature
which
i
consulted
before
coming
away
that
a
french
writer
wrote
an
elaborate
treatise
to
prove
that
tea
merchants
were
always
immoral
members
of
society
it
would
be
rather
curious
to
apply
the
theory
to
the
present
day

direct
this
letter
to
your
ancient
patrimonial

unknowing
whether
it

where
it

if

but
wherever
you
are
i
find
some
considerable
relief
in
turning
from
the
lofty
correspondence
of
the
secretary
with
no
disparagement
of
my
friend
oldershaw
to
another
friend
as

who
can
discourse
on
some

subjects

the

and
who
will
not
devote
the
whole
of
his
correspondence
to
the
questions
of
that
excellent
and
valuable
body
the
society
is
a
very
good
thing
in
its
way
being
the
president
i
naturally
think
so
but
like
other
good
things
you
may
have
too
much
of
it
and
i
have
had
as
i
said
before
i
do
know
where
you
are
disporting
yourself
beyond
some
hurried
remark
about
paris
which
you
dropped
in
our
hurried
interview
in
one
of
the
brilliant
flashes
of
silence
between
those
imbecile
screams
and
yells
and
stamping
which
even
the
natural
enthusiasm
at
the
prospect
of
being
broken
up
can
not
excuse

you
will
probably
guess
that
as
far
as
personal
taste
and
instincts
are
concerned
i
share
all
your
antipathy
to
the
noisy
plebian
excursionist
a
visit
to
ramsgate
during
the
season
and
the
vision
of
the
crowded
howling
sands
has
left
in
me
feelings
which
all
my
radicalism
can
not
allay
at
the
same
time
i
think
that
the
lower
orders
are
seen
unfavorably
when
enjoying
themselves
in
labour
and
trouble
they
are
more
dignified
and
less
noisy
your
suggestion
as
to
a
series
of
soliloquies
is
very
flattering
and
has
taken
hold
of
me
to
the
extent
of
writing
a
similar
ballad
on
simon
de
montfort
the
order
in
which
they
come
is
rather
incongruous
particularly
if
i
include
the
list
i
have
in
mind
for
the
future
thus

to

that
this

which
hi

ti
etc
and
all
the
ills
in
its
train
have
not
penetrated
in
these
last
two
letters
there
are
sentences
of
a
kind
not
to
be
found
anywhere
else
in
chesterton
the
disparagement
of
lucian
oldershaw
excessive
enthusiasm
for
the
junior
debating
club
the
solemn
reprobation
of
the
imbecile
screams
and
yells
and
stamping
of
the
last
day
at
school
before
the
summer
holidays
the
antipathy
expressed
for
the
rowdy
enjoyments
of
the
lower
orders
these
things
are
not
in
the
least
like
either
the
chesterton
that
was
to
be
or
the
chesterton
that
then
was
but
they
are
very
much
like
bentley
he
was
two
years
younger
than
chesterton
but
far
older
than
his
years
and
seemed
indeed
to
the
other
boys
and
perhaps
to
himself
like
an
elderly
gentleman
smiling
a
remote
amused
smile
at
the
enthusiasms
of
the
young
i
get
the
strongest
feeling
that
at
this
stage
chesterton
not
only
admired
him
as
he
was
to
do
all
his
life
but
wanted
to
be
like
him
to
say
the
kind
of
thing
he
thought
bentley
would
say
this
phase
did
not
last
as
we
shall

it

gone

my

murmurs
that

i
abominate

all

want

i
agree
with
you
in
your
admiration
for
paradise

but
consider
it
on
the
whole
too
light
and
childish
a
book
for
persons
of
our

it
is
all
very
well
as

read
pretty
stories
about
satan

we
have
only
just
mastered
our

when

we
get

we
know

cinderella
is
much
better

any
of

regards
one
question
which
you
asked
i
may
remark
that
the
children
of
israel
presumably
the
solomons
have
not
gone
unto
horeb
neither
unto
sittim
but
unto
the
land
that

they
went
and
abode
therein
and
they
came
unto
a
city
even
unto
the
city
that
is
called
shrewsbury
and
there
they
builded
themselves
an
home
where
they
might
abide
and
their
home
was
in
the
land
that
was
called
castle

and
their
home
was
the
tabernacle
in
that
land
and
they
abode
with
certain
of

this
remark
is
not
so
irrelevant
and
horace
as
it
may
appear
i
have
just
had
a
demonstration
of
its
truth
on
the
coach
coming
down
here
two
very
nice
little
french
boys
of
cropped
hair
and
restless
movements
were
just
in
front
of
us
and
my
pater
having
discovered
that
the
book
they
had
with
them
was
a
prize
at
a
paris
school
some
slight
conversation
arose
not
thinking
my
french
altogether
equal
to
a
prolonged
interview
i
took
out
a
scrap
of
paper
and
began
with
a
fine
carelessness
to
draw
a
picture
of
napoleon
i
hat
chin
attitude
all
complete
this
of
course
was
gazed
at
rapturously
by
these
two
young
inheritors
of
glory
and
it
ended
in
my
drawing
them
unlimited
goblins
to
keep
for
the
remainder
of
the
interview
in
may
the
chairman
of
the
attained
the
maturity
of
seventeen
the
secretary
then
rose
and
in
a
speech
in
which
he
extolled
the
merits
of
the
chairman
as
a
chairman
and
mentioned
the
benefit
which
the
junior
debating
club
received
on
the
day
of
which
this
was
the
anniversary
the
natal
day
of
chesterton
proposed
that
a
vote
wishing
him
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
and
a
long
continuance
in
the
chair
of
the
club
should
be
passed
this
was
carried
with
acclamations
the
chairman
replied
after
restoring
order
naturally
this
question
of
order
among
a
crowd
of
boys
loomed
large
at
the
beginning
a
number
of
rules
were
passed
giving
great
powers
to
the
chairman
which
that
gentleman
he
says
of
himself
lenient
by
temperament
and
republican
by
principles
certainly
would
never
have
put
in
force
it
was
seldom
enough
he
continues
that
a
boy
of
found
himself
in
the
position
of
the
chairman
an
attitude
of
command
and
responsibility
over
a
body
of
his
friends
and
equals
and
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
they
would
easily
take
to
the
state
of
things
nor
was
the
chairman
himself
like
the
secretary
protected
and
armed
by
any
personal
aptitude
for
practical
proceedings
but
solely
by
the
certain
degree
of
respect
entertained
for
his
character
and
acquirements
this
respect
sincere
and
even
excessive
as
it
frequently
was
contrasted
somewhat
humorously
with
the
common
inattention
to
questions
of
order
nor
could
anything
be
more
noisy
than
the
loyalty
of
fordham
and
langdon
davies
with
the
exception
of
their
interruptions
it
may
then
fairly
be
said
that
the
troubles
and
discussions
of
the
first
months
of
the
club
existence
centred
practically
round
the
question
of
order
the
first
of
the
great
difficulties
of
this
most
difficult
enterprise
how
boys
who
could
scarcely
be
got
to
behave
quietly
under
the
strictest
schoolmasters
could
ever
be
brought
to
obey
the
rebuke
of
their
equal
and
schoolfellow
how
a
heterogeneous
pack
of
average
schoolboys
could
organise
themselves
into
a
republic
these
were
problems
of
real
and
stupendous
difficulty
the
fines
of
a
penny
and
of
twopence
which
were
instituted
at
the
first
meeting
were
found
hopelessly
incompetent
to
cope
with
the
bursts
of
oblivious
hilarity
fordham
in
particular
whose
constant
breaches
of
order
threatened
to
exhaust
even
the
extensive
treasury
of
that
spoilt
and
opulent
young
gentleman
soon
left
calculation
far
behind
nor
can
the
story
be
better
or
more
brightly
told
than
by
himself
he
wrote
at
one
time
after
considerable
calculation
found
that
he
was
in
debt
to
the
extent
of
some
or
shillings
but
as
he
felt
that
by
refusing
to
pay
the
sum
he
would
be
striking
a
blow
for
the
liberty
of
the
subject
he
manfully
held
out
against
what
he
considered
an
unjust
punishment
for
such
diminutive
frivolities
as
he
had
indulged
in
at
times
incidents
of
a
disturbing
and
playful
nature
have
roused
the
wrath
of
the
chairman
and
secretary
to
a
pitch
awful
to
behold
at
one
time
a
member
who
soon
resigned
spent
a
considerable
part
of
a
meeting
under
the
table
till
he
found
himself
used
as
a
public
footstool
and
a
doormat
combined
at
another
as
bentley
was
departing
from
the
scene
of
chaos
a
penny
bun
of
the
sticky
order
caressingly
stung
his
honoured
cheek
sped
upon
its
errand
of
mercy
by
the
unerring
aim
of
he
was
in
fact
sixteen
when
the
began
of
the
fordham
well
remembers
how
one
day
took
him
aside
at
the
oldershaws
house
and
told
him
that
he
really
must
be
less
exuberant
this
historic
occasion
was
always
alluded
to
later
as
the
day
on
which
the
chairman
spoke
seriously
to
after
various
resignations
order
was
restored
and
a
little
later
two
of
the
chief
recalcitrants
asked
to
be
received
back
into
the
club
i
feel
so
lonely
without
it
one
of
them
had
remarked
and
comments
this
has
always
appeared
to
the
present
writer
one
of
the
most
important
speeches
in
the
history
of
the
club
the
junior
debating
club
had
come
through
its
moments
of
difficulty
and
was
a
fact
and
an
establishment
nor
was
the
circulation
of
long
confined
to
members
of
the
club
and
their
own
circle
of
friends
and
relatives
some
of
the
boys
had
no
doubt
a
regular
allowance
but
probably
a
small
one
gilbert
himself
says
in
his
diary
that
he
had
no
income
except
errant
sixpences
and
printers
bills
had
to
be
paid
moreover
in
the
first
number
the
editor
lucian
oldershaw
confessed
frankly
that
one
reason
for
the
paper
existence
was
that
the
society
may
not
degenerate
into
the
position
of
a
mutual
admiration
society
by
totally
lacking
the
admiration
of
outsiders
the
staff
were
able
immediately
to
note
any
apprehensions
we
may
have
felt
on
the
morning
of
the
publication
of

speedily
dispelled
when
by
nightfall
we
had
disposed
of
all
our
copies
of
a
later
issue
the
energetic
editor
sold
copies
in
the
course
of
the
summer
holidays
masters
too
began
to
read
it
and
at
last
a
copy
was
hid
on
the
table
of
the
high
master
walker
cecil
chesterton
describes
the
high
master
as
a
gigantic
man
with
a
booming
voice
some
paulines
believed
he
had
given
gilbert
the
first
inspiration
for
the
personality
of
sunday
in
man
who
was
another
contemporary
says
that
he
was
reputed
to
take
no
interest
in
anything
except
examination
successes
and
that
the
boys
were
amazed
at
the
effect
on
him
of
reading
reading
in
the
light
of
his
future
one
sees
qualities
in
gilbert
work
not
to
be
found
in
that
of
the
other
contributors
but
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
members
were
in
fact
a
quite
unusually
able
group
almost
every
one
of
them
took
brilliant
scholarships
to
oxford
or
cambridge
the
high
master
had
never
boasted
of
so
many
scholarships
from
one
set
of
boys
and
in
reading
an
enjoyment
i
wish
others
could
share
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
the
relative
ages
of
the
contributors
it
is
i
think
striking
that
all
these
boys
should
have
recognised
gilbert
quality
and
accepted
his
leadership
for
they
were
all
a
year
or
so
younger
than
he
was
and
yet
were
in
the
same
form
they
knew
that
this
was
only
because
would
not
bother
to
do
his
school
work
still
i
think
that
at
that
age
they
showed
insight
by
knowing
it
gilbert
work
is
to
be
found
in
every
number
of
usually
verse
as
well
as
prose
both
fordham
and
oldershaw
remember
most
vividly
the
effect
of
reading
a
fanciful
essay
on
dragons
in
the
first
number
the
dragon
it
began
is
the
most
cosmopolitan
of
impossibilities
and
the
boys
rolling
the
words
on
their
tongues
murmured
to
one
another
this
is
literature
except
for
a
very
occasional
flash
the
one
element
not
yet
visible
in
these
essays
is
humour
this
is
curious
because
some
of
his
most
brilliant
fooling
belongs
to
the
same
period
in
a
collection
made
after
his
death
coloured
is
an
illustrated
jeu
of
hours

hades
an
elementary

of

which
is
as
amusing

thing
as

ever
wrote
the

he
made
for
it
show
specimens
of
the
evolution
of
various
types
of

is
nothing
of
this
kind
in
besides

soliloquies
mentioned
in

to
bentley

are
poems
in
which
he
is
beginning
to
feel
after

showed
a
range
and
a
quality
of
literary
criticism
alike
surprising
perhaps
most
surprising
however
is
the
fact
that
all
this
does
not
seem
to
have
made
clear
to
either
masters
or
parents
the
true
nature
of
vocation
he
suffered
at
this
date
from
having
too
many
talents
for
he
still
went
on
drawing
and
his
drawings
seemed
to
many
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
him
and
were
certainly
the
thing
he
most
enjoyed
doing
even
now
his
school
work
had
not
brought
him
into
the
highest
form
called
not
the
sixth
as
in
most
schools
but
the
eighth
the
highest
form
he
ever
reached
was
but
in
the
summer
term
of
he
entered
a
competition
for
a
prize
poem
and
won
it
the
subject
chosen
was
francis
xavier
i
give
the
poem
in
appendix
a
it
is
not
as
notable
as
some
other
of
his
work
at
that
time
what
is
interesting
is
that
in
it
this
schoolboy
expresses
with
some
power
a
view
he
was
later
to
explode
yet
more
powerfully
he
might
have
claimed
for
himself
what
he
said
of
earlier
writers
it
is
not
true
that
they
did
not
see
our
modern
difficulties
they
saw
through
them
never
before
had
this
contest
been
won
by
any
but
an
eighth
form
boy
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
gilbert
was
amazed
to
find
a
short
notice
posted
on
the
board
chesterton
to
rank
with
the

the

chapter

art
schools
and

college
when
all
gilbert
friends
were
at
oxford
or
cambridge
he
used
to
say
how
glad
he
was
that
his
own
choice
had
been
a
different
one
he
never
sighed
for
oxford
he
never
regretted
his
rather
curious
experiences
at
an
art
school
two
art
schools
really
although
he
only
talks
of
one
in
the
for
he
was
for
a
short
time
at
a
school
of
art
in
john
wood
calderon
lawrence
solomon
thought
whence
he
passed
to
the
slade
school
he
was
there
from
to
and
during
part
of
that
time
he
attended
lectures
on
english
literature
at
university
college
the
chapter
on
the
experiences
of
the
next
two
years
is
called
in
the
how
to
be
a
lunatic
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
years
were
crucial
and
at
times
crucifying
in
gilbert
life
during
a
happily
prolonged
youth
he
was
now
eighteen
and
a
half
he
had
developed
very
slowly
but
normally
surrounded
by
pleasant
friendships
and
home
influences
he
had
never
really
become
aware
of
evil
now
it
broke
upon
him
suddenly
probably
to
a
degree
exaggerated
by
his
strong
imagination
and
distorted
by
the
fact
that
he
was
undergoing
physical
changes
usually
belonging
to
an
earlier
age
towards
the
end
of
his
school
life
gilbert
voice
had
not
yet
broken
his
mother
took
him
to
a
doctor
to
be
overhauled
and
was
told
that
his
brain
was
the
largest
and
most
sensitive
the
doctor
had
ever
seen
a
genius
or
an
idiot
was
his
verdict
on
the
probabilities
above
all
things
she
was
told
to
avoid
for
him
any
sort
of
shock
physically
mentally
spiritually
he
was
on
a
very
large
scale
and
probably
for
that
reason
of
a
slow
rate
of
development
the
most
highly
differentiated
organisms
are
the
slowest
to
mature
and
without
question
gilbert
did
mature
very
late
he
was
now
passing
through
the
stage
described
by
keats
the
imagination
of
a
boy
is
healthy
and
the
mature
imagination
of
a
man
is
healthy
but
there
is
a
space
of
life
between
a
period
unhealthy
or
at
least
intellectually
gilbert
suffered
at
this
time
from
an
extreme
scepticism
as
he
expressed
it
he
felt
as
if
everything
might
be
a
dream
as
if
he
had
projected
the
universe
from
within
the
agnostic
doubts
the
existence
of
god
gilbert
at
moments
doubted
the
existence
of
the
agnostic
morally
his
temptations
seem
to
have
been
in
some
strange
psychic
region
rather
than
merely
physical
the
whole
period
is
best
summarised
in
a
passage
from
the
for
looking
back
after
forty
years
gilbert
still
saw
it
as
deeply
and
darkly
significant
as
both
a
mental
and
moral
extreme
of
danger
there
is
something
truly
menacing
in
the
thought
of
how
quickly
i
could
imagine
the
maddest
when
i
had
never
committed
the
mildest
crime
there
was
a
time
when
i
had
reached
that
condition
of
moral
anarchy
within
in
which
a
man
says
in
the
words
of
wilde
that
atys
with
the
knife
were
better
than
the
thing
i
am
i
have
never
indeed
felt
the
faintest
temptation
to
the
particular
madness
of
wilde
but
i
could
at
this
time
imagine
the
worst
and
wildest
disproportions
and
distortions
of
more
normal
passion
the
point
is
that
the
whole
mood
was
overpowered
and
oppressed
with
a
sort
of
congestion
of
imagination
as
bunyan
in
his
morbid
period
described
himself
as
prompted
to
utter
blasphemies
i
had
an
overpowering
impulse
to
record
or
draw
horrible
ideas
and
images
lunging
deeper
and
deeper
as
in
a
blind
spiritual
suicide
pp
two
of
his
intimate
friends
finding
at
this
time
a
notebook
full
of
these
horrible
drawings
asked
one
another
is
chesterton
going
mad
he
dabbled
too
in
spiritualism
until
he
realised
that
he
had
reached
the
verge
of
forbidden
and
dangerous
ground
i
would
not
altogether
rule
out
the
suggestion
of
some
that
we
were
playing
with
fire
or
even
with
in
the
words
that
were
written
for
us
there
was
nothing
ostensibly
degrading
but
any
amount
that
was
deceiving
i
saw
quite
enough
of
the
thing
to
be
able
to
testify
with
complete
certainty
that
something
happens
which
is
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
natural
or
produced
by
the
normal
and
conscious
human
will
whether
it
is
produced
by
some
subconscious
but
still
human
force
or
by
some
powers
good
bad
or
indifferent
which
are
external
to
humanity
i
would
not
myself
attempt
to
decide
the
only
thing
i
will
say
with
complete
confidence
about
that
mystic
and
invisible
power
is
that
it
tells
lies
the
lies
may
be
larks
or
they
may
be
lures
to
the
imperilled
soul
or
they
may
be
a
thousand
other
things
but
whatever
they
are
they
are
not
truths
about
the
other
world
or
for
that
matter
about
this
world
p
he
told
father
some
years
that
he
had
used
the
planchette
freely
at
one
time
but
had
to
give
it
up
on
account
of
headaches
ensuing
the
headaches
came
a
horrid
feeling
as
if
one
were
trying
to
get
over
a
bad
spree
with
what
i
can
best
describe
as
a
bad
smell
in
the
mind
brown
on
chesterton
p
idling
at
his
work
he
fell
in
with
other
idlers
and
has
left
a
vivid
description
in
a
article
called
the
diabolist
of
one
of
his
fellow
students
it
was
strange
perhaps
that
i
liked
his
dirty
drunken
society
it
was
stranger
still
perhaps
that
he
liked
my
society
for
hours
of
the
day
he
would
talk
with
me
about
milton
or
gothic
architecture
for
hours
of
the
night
he
would
go
where
i
have
no
wish
to
follow
him
even
in
speculation
he
was
a
man
with
a
long
ironical
face
and
close
red
hair
he
was
by
class
a
gentleman
and
could
walk
like
one
but
preferred
for
some
reason
to
walk
like
a
groom
carrying
two
pails
he
looked
like
a
sort
of
as
if
some
archangel
had
gone
on
the
turf
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
in
which
he
and
i
argued
about
real
things
for
the
first
and
last
time
he
had
a
horrible
fairness
of
the
intellect
that
made
me
despair
of
his
soul
a
common
harmless
atheist
would
have
denied
that
religion
produced
humility
or
humility
a
simple
joy
but
he
admitted
both
he
only
said
but
shall
i
not
find
in
evil
a
life
of
its
own
granted
that
for
every
woman
i
ruin
one
of
those
red
sparks
will
go
out
will
not
the
expanding
pleasure
of
ruin
do
you
see
that
fire
i
asked
if
we
had
a
real
fighting
democracy
some
one
would
burn
you
in
it
like
the
that
you
are
perhaps
he
said
in
his
tired
fair
way
only
what
you
call
evil
i
call
good
he
went
down
the
great
steps
alone
and
i
felt
as
if
i
wanted
the
steps
swept
and
cleaned
i
followed
later
and
as
i
went
to
find
my
hat
in
the
low
dark
passage
where
it
hung
i
suddenly
heard
his
voice
again
but
the
words
were
inaudible
i
stopped
startled
but
then
i
heard
the
voice
of
one
of
the
vilest
of
his
associates
saying
nobody
can
possibly
know
and
then
i
heard
those
two
or
three
words
which
i
remember
in
every
syllable
and
can
not
forget
i
heard
the
diabolist
say
i
tell
you
i
have
done
everything
else
if
i
do
that
i
sha
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
i
rushed
out
without
daring
to
pause
and
as
i
passed
the
fire
i
did
not
know
whether
it
was
hell
or
the
furious
love
of
god
i
have
since
heard
that
he
died
it
may
be
said
i
think
that
he
committed
suicide
though
he
did
it
with
tools
of
pleasure
not
with
tools
of
pain
god
help
him
i
know
the
road
he
went
but
i
have
never
known
or
even
dared
to
think

was

at
which

gilbert
was
devoted
to
them
all
but
as
we
have
seen
bentley
was
the
supreme
friendship
of
his
youth
it
was
a
friendship
in
foolery
as
we
are
told
by
the
dedication
of
at
play
he
was
through
boyhood
storm
and
shower
my
best
my
nearest
friend
we
wore
one
hat
smoked
one
cigar
one
standing
at
each
end
it
was
a
deeply
serious
friendship
as
we
are
told
in
the
dedication
of
man
who
was
with
bentley
alone
he
shared
the
doubts
that
drove
us
through
the
night
as
we
two
talked
amain
and
day
had
broken
on
the
streets
ere
it
broke
upon
the
brain
most
young
men
write
or
at
least
begin
novels
of
which
they
are
themselves
the
heroes
gilbert
wrote
and
illustrated
a
fairy
story
about
a
boyish
romance
of
lucian
oldershaw
while
two
unfinished
novels
have
bentley
for
hero
he
is
too

mediaeval

sir
edmund

the
brotherhood
of
the
jongleurs
de

gilbert
sings
like
all
young
poets
of
first
love
but
it
is
bentley
not
his
own
he
was
as
much
excited
about
a
girl
bentley
had
fallen
in
love
with
as
if
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
himself
and
where
a
london
street
has
a
special
significance
one
discovers
it
is
because
of
a
memory
of
bentley
to
bentley
then
with
whom
all
was
shared
gilbert
wrote
when
through
friendship
and
the
goodness
of
things
he
had
come
out
again
into
the
daylight
the
second
thought
that
had
saved
him
had
largely
grown
out
of
the
first
the
meant
friendship
friendship
meant
the
highest
of
all
good
things
and
all
good
things
called
for
gratitude

he
gave

undated
but
probably
long
your
letter
was
most
welcome
in
which
however
it
does
not
differ
widely
from
most
of
your
letters
i
read
somewhere
in
some
fatuous
complete
or
something
that
it
is
correct
to
imitate
the
order
of
subjects
etc
observed
by
your
correspondent
in
obedience
to
this
rule
of
breeding
i
will
hurriedly
remark
that
my
holiday
has
been
nice
enough
in
itself
we
walk
about
lie
on
the
sand
go
and
swim
in
the
sea
when
it
generally
rains
and
the
combination
gets
in
our
mouths
and
we
say
the
name
of
the
professor
in
the
water
babies
inwardly
speaking
i
have
had
a
funny
time
a
meaningless
fit
of
depression
taking
the
form
of
certain
absurd
psychological
worries
came
upon
me
and
instead
of
dismissing
it
and
talking
to
people
i
had
it
out
and
went
very
far
into
the
abysses
indeed
the
result
was
that
i
found
that
things
when
examined
necessarily
such
a
mystically
satisfactory
state
of
things
that
without
getting
back
to
earth
i
saw
lots
that
made
me
certain
it
is
all
right
the
vision
is
fading
into
common
day
now
and
i
am
glad
the
frame
of
mind
was
the
reverse
of
gloomy
but
it
would
not
do
for
long
it
is
embarrassing
talking
with
god
face
to
face
as
a
man
speaketh
to
his
friend
and
in
another
letter
a
cosmos
one
day
being
rebuked
by
a
pessimist
replied
how
can
you
who
revile
me
consent
to
speak
by
my
machinery
permit
me
to
reduce
you
to
nothingness
and
then
we
will
discuss
the
matter
moral
you
should
not
look
a
gift
universe
in
the
mouth
another
powerful
influence
in
the
direction
of
mental
health
was
the
discovery
of
walt
whitman
poetry
i
shall
never
forget
lucian
oldershaw
writes
reading
to
him
from
the
canterbury
walt
whitman
in
my
bedroom
at
west
kensington
the
séance
lasted
from
two
to
three
hours
and
we
were
intoxicated
with
the
excitement
of
the
discovery
for
some
time
now
we
shall
find
gilbert
dismissing
belief
in
any
positive
existence
of
evil
and
treating
the
universe
on
the
whitman
principle
of
jubilant
and
universal
acceptance
he
writes
too
in
the
whitman
style
by
far
the
most
important
of
his
notebooks
is
one
which
by
amazing
good
fortune
can
be
dated
beginning
in
and
continuing
for
several
years
in
its
attitude
to
man
it
is
whitmanesque
to
a
high
degree
yet
it
is
also
most
characteristically
chestertonian
whitman
is
content
with
a
shouting
roaring
optimism
about
life
and
humanity
chesterton
had
to
find
for
it
a
philosophical
basis
heartily
as
he
disliked
the
literary
pessimism
of
the
hour
he
was
not
content
simply
to
exchange
one
mood
for
another
for
whether
he
was
conscious
of
it
at
the
time
or
not
he
did
later
see
walt
whitman
outlook
as
a
mood
and
not
a
philosophy
it
was
a
mood
however
that
chesterton
himself
never
really
lost
solely
because
he
did
discover
the
philosophy
needed
to
sustain
it
and
thereby
even
in
this
early
notebook
he
goes
far
beyond
whitman
even
so
early
he
knew
that
a
philosophy
of
man
could
not
be
a
philosophy
of
man
only
he
already
a
presence
in
the
universe
it
is
evening
and
into
the
room
enters
again
a
large
indiscernable
presence
is
it
a
man
or
a
woman
is
it
one
long
dead
or
yet
to
come
that
sits
with
me
in
the
evening
this
again
might
have
been
only
a
mood
had
he
not
found
the
philosophy
to
sustain
it
too
it
is
remarkable
how
much
of
this
philosophy
he
had
arrived
at
in
the
notebook
before
he
had
come
to
know
catholics
indeed
the
notebook
seems
to
me
so
important
that
it
needs
a
chapter
to
itself
with
abundant
quotation
meanwhile
what
was
gilbert
doing
about
his
work
at
university
college
professor
fred
brown
told
lawrence
solomon
that
when
he
was
at
the
slade
school
he
always
seemed
to
be
writing
and
while
listening
to
lectures
he
was
always
drawing
it
is
probably
true
that
as
cecil
chesterton
says
he
shrank
from
the
technical
toils
of
the
artist
as
he
never
did
later
from
those
of
authorship
and
none
of
the
professors
regarded
him
as
a
serious
art
student
they
pointed
later
to
his
illustrations
of
for
as
proof
that
he
never
learnt
to
draw
yet
how
many
of
the
men
who
did
learn
seriously
could
have
drawn
those
sketches
full
of
crazy
energy
and
vitality
i
know
nothing
about
drawing
but
anyone
may
know
how
brilliant
are
the
illustrations
to
at
or
for
and
later
to
belloc
novels
and
anyone
can
see
the
power
of
line
with
which
he
drew
in
his
notebooks
unfinished
suggestions
of
humanity
or
divinity
anyone
too
can
recognise
a
portrait
of
a
man
and
faces
full
of
character
continue
to
adorn
exercise
books
of
living
models
he
affected
chiefly
gladstone
balfour
and
joe
chamberlin
in
hours
of
thought
he
made
drawings
of
our
lord
with
a
crown
of
thorns
or
nailed
to
a
cross
these
suddenly
appear
in
any
of
his
books
between
fantastic
drawings
or
lecture
notes
as
the
mind
wandered
and
lingered
the
fingers
followed
it
and
as
gilbert
listened
to
lectures
he
would
even
draw
on
the
top
of
his
own
notes
he
had
always
had
facility
and
that
facility
increased
so
that
in
later
years
he
often
completed
in
a
couple
of
hours
the
illustrations
to
a
novel
of
belloc
nor
were
these
drawings
merely
illustrations
of
an
already
completed
text
for
belloc
has
told
me
that
the
characters
were
often
half
suggested
to
him
by
his
friend
drawings
on
one
at
any
rate
of
his
vacations
gilbert
went
to
italy
and
two
letters
to
bentley
show
much
of
the
way
his
thoughts
were
going

probably
dear
bentley
i
turn
to
write
my
second
letter
to
you
and
my
first
to
grey
maurice
solomon
just
after
having
a
very
interesting
conversation
with
an
elderly
american
like
colonel
newcome
though
much
better
informed
with
whom
i
compared
notes
on
botticelli
ruskin
carlyle
emerson
and
the
world
in
general
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
whitman
he
answered
frankly
that
in
america
they
were
hardly
up
to
him
we
have
one
town
boston
he
said
precisely
that
has
got
up
to
browning
he
then
added
that
there
was
one
thing
everyone
in
america
remembered
whitman
himself
the
old
gentleman
quite
kindled
on
this
topic
whitman
was
a
real
man
a
man
who
was
so
pure
and
strong
that
we
could
not
imagine
him
doing
an
unmanly
thing
anywhere
it
was
odd
words
to
hear
at
a
table
from
your
next
door
neighbour
it
made
me
quite
excited
over
my
salad
you
see
that
this
humanitarianism
in
which
we
are
entangled
asserts
itself
where
by
all
guidebook
laws
it
should
not
when
i
take
up
my
pen
to
write
to
you
i
am
thinking
more
of
a
old
yankee
at
an
hotel
than
about
the
things
i
have
seen
within
the
same
hours
the
frescoes
of
santa
croce
the
illuminations
of
marco
the
white
marbles
of
the
tower
of
giotto
the
very
madonnas
of
raphael
the
very
david
of
michael
angelo
throughout
this
tour
in
pursuance
of
our
theory
of
travelling
we
have
avoided
the
guide
he
is
the
of
individual
liberty
once
only
we
broke
through
our
rule
and
that
was
in
favour
of
an
extremely
intelligent
nay
impulsive
young
italian
in
santa
maria
novella
a
church
where
we
saw
some
of
the
most
interesting
pieces
of
mediaeval
painting
i
have
ever
seen
interesting
not
so
much
from
an
artistic
as
from
a
moral
and
historical
point
of
view
particularly
noticeable
was
the
great
fresco
expressive
of
the
grandest
mediaeval
conception
of
the
communion
of
saints
a
figure
of
christ
surmounting
a
crowd
of
all
ages
and
stations
among
whom
were
not
only
dante
petrarca
giotto
but
plato
cicero
and
best
of
all
arius
i
said
to
the
guide
in
a
tone
of
expostulation
heretico
a
word
of
impromptu
manufacture
whereupon
he
nodded
smiled
and
was
positively
radiant
with
the
latitudinarianism
of
the
old
italian
painter
it
was
interesting
for
it
was
a
fresh
proof
that
even
the
early
church
united
had
a
period
of
thought
and
tolerance
before
the
dark
ages
closed
around
it
there
is
one
thing
that
i
must
tell
you
more
of
when
we
meet
the
tower
of
giotto
it
was
built
in
a
square
of
florence
near
the
cathedral
by
a
young
painter
and
architect
who
had
kept
sheep
as
a
boy
on
the
tuscan
hills
it
is
still
called
the
shepherd
tower
what
i
want
to
tell
you
about
is
the
series
of
which
giotto
traced
on
it
representing
the
creation
and
progress
of
man
his
discovery
of
navigation
astronomy
law
music
and
so
on
it
is
religious
in
the
grandest
sense
but
there
is
not
a
shred
of
doctrine
even
the
fall
is
omitted
about
this
history
in
stone
if
walt
whitman
had
been
an
architect
he
would
have
built
such
a
tower
with
such
a
story
on
it
as
i
want
to
go
out
and
have
a
good
look
at
it
before
we
start
for
venice
tomorrow
i
must
cut
this
short
i
hope
you
are
enjoying
yourself
as
much
as
i
am
and
thinking
about
me
half
as
much
as
i
am
about
you
your
very
sincere
friend
gilbert
chesterton
no
one
would
have
enjoyed
more
than
gilbert
rereading
this
letter
in
after
years
and
noting
the
suggestion
that
the
fifteenth
century
belonged
to
the
early
church
and
preceded
the
dark
ages
and
i
think
too
that
even
in
giotto
tower
he
might
later
have
discovered
some
roots
of
doctrine

dear
bentley
i
write
you
a
third
letter
before
coming
back
while
venice
and
verona
are
fresh
in
my
mind
of
the
former
i
can
really
only
discourse
viva
voce
imagine
a
city
whose
very
slums
are
full
of
palaces
whose
every
other
house
wall
has
a
battered
fresco
or
a
gothic
imagine
a
sky
fretted
with
every
kind
of
pinnacle
from
the
great
dome
of
the
salute
to
the
gothic
spires
of
the
ducal
palace
and
the
downright
arabesque
orientalism
of
the
minarets
of
mark
and
then
imagine
the
whole
flooded
with
a
sea
that
seems
only
intended
to
reflect
sunsets
and
you
still
have
no
idea
of
the
place
i
stopped
in
for
more
than
hours
thence
we
went
to
verona
where
romeo
and
juliet
languished
and
dante
wrote
most
of
hell
the
principal
products
tombs
particularly
those
of
the
scala
a
very
good
old
family
with
an
excellent
taste
in
fratricide
their
three
tombs
one
to
each
man
i
mean
one
man
one
grave
are
really
glorious
examples
of
three
stages
of
gothic
of
which
more
when
we
meet
balconies
with
young
ladies
hanging
over
them
really
quite
a
preponderating
feature
whether
this
was
done
in
obedience
to
local
associations
and
in
expectation
of
a
romeo
i
ca
say
i
can
only
remark
that
if
such
was
the
object
the
supply
of
juliets
seemed
very
much
in
excess
of
the
demand
roman
remains
on
which
however
i
did
not
pronounce
a
soliloquy
beginning
wonderful
people
which
is
the
correct
thing
to
do
just
as
i
get
to
this
i
receive
your
letter
and
resolve
to
begin
another
sheet
of
paper
i
did
read
rosebery
speech
and
was
more
than
interested
i
was
stirred
the
old
order
of
parliamentary
forms
peerages
whiggism
and
right
honourable
friends
has
changed
yielding
place
to
the
new
of
industrialism
county
council
sanitation
education
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
hand
and
whatever
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
may
say
god
fulfils
himself
in
many
ways
even
by
local
government
several
things
in
your
letter
require
notice
first
the
accusation
levelled
against
me
of
being
prejudiced
against
professor
huxley
i
repel
with
indignation
and
scorn
you
are
not
prejudiced
against
cheese
because
you
like
oranges
and
though
the
professor
is
not
isaiah
or
francis
or
whitman
or
richard
le
gallienne
to
name
some
of
those
whom
i
happen
to
affect
i
should
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
say
a
word
against
an
earnest
able
and
most
refreshingly
rational
man
by
far
the
best
man
of
his
type
i
know
as
to
what
you
say
on
education
generally
i
am
entirely
with
you
but
it
will
take
a
good
interview
to
say
how
much
as
for
the
little
solomons
i
am
prepared
to
be
fond
of
all
of
them
as
i
am
of
all
children
even
the
grubby
little
mendicants
that
run
these
italian
streets
i
am
glad
you
and
grey
have
pottered
potter
again
i
have
had
such
a
nice
letter
from
lawrence
it
makes
me
think
it
is
all
going
to
be
the
fair
beginning
of
a
time
had
the
months
of
art
study
only
developed
in
gilbert
chesterton
his
power
of
drawing
they
might
still
have
been
worthwhile
but
they
gave
him
too
a
time
to
dream
and
to
think
which
working
for
a
university
degree
would
never
have
allowed
his
views
and
his
mind
were
developing
fast
and
he
was
also
developing
a
power
to
which
we
owe
some
of
his
best
work
depth
of
vision
most
art
criticism
is
the
work
of
those
who
never
could
have
been
artists
which
is
possibly
why
it
tends
to
be
so
critical
gilbert
who
could
perhaps
have
been
an
artist
preferred
to
appreciate
what
the
artist
was
trying
to
say
and
to
put
into
words
what
he
read
on
the
canvas
hence
both
in
his
and
his
we
get
what
some
of
us
ask
of
an
art
critic
the
enlargement
of
our
own
powers
of
vision
this
is
what
made
ruskin
so
great
an
art
critic
a
fact
once
realised
today
forgotten
he
may
have
made
a
thousand
mistakes
he
had
a
multitude
of
foolish
prejudices
but
he
opened
the
eyes
of
a
whole
generation
to
see
and
understand
great
art
was
to
begin
his
published
writings
with
poetry
and
art
criticism
in
other
words
with
vision
and
this
vision
he
partly
owed
to
the
slade
school
here
is
a
letter
undated
to
bentley
containing
a
hint
of
what
eight
years
later
became
a
book
on
watts
on
saturday
i
saw
two
exhibitions
of
pictures
the
first
was
the
royal
academy
where
i
went
with
salter
there
was
one
picture
there
though
the
walls
were
decorated
with
frames
very
prettily
as
to
the
one
picture
if
you
look
at
an
academy
catalogue
you
will
see
jonah
by
watts
and
you
will
imagine
a
big
silly
picture
of
a
whale
but
if
you
go
to
burlington
house
you
will
see
something
terrible
a
spare
wild
figure
clad
in
a
strange
sort
of
green
with
his
head
flung
so
far
back
that
his
upper
part
is
a
miracle
of
foreshortening
his
hands
thrust
out
his
face
ghastly
with
ecstasy
his
dry
lips
yelling
aloud
a
figure
of
everlasting
protest
and
defiance
and
as
a
background
perfect
in
harmony
of
colour
you
have
the
tracery
of
the
assyrian
such
as
survive
in
wrecks
in
the
british
museum
a
row
of
those
processions
of
numberless
captives
bowing
before
smiling
kings
a
cruel
sort
of
art
and
the
passionate
energy
of
that
lonely
screaming
figure
in
front
makes
you
think
of
a
great
many
things
besides
assyrians
among
others
of
some
words
of
renan
i
quote
from
memory
but
the
trace
of
israel
will
be
eternal
she
it
was
who
alone
among
the
tyrannies
of
antiquity
raised
her
voice
for
the
helpless
the
oppressed
the
forgotten
but
this
only
expresses
a
fraction
of
it
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
come
and
look
at
this
excited
gentleman
with
bronze
skin
and
hair
that
approaches
green
his
eyes
simply
white
with
madness
and
jonah
said
yea
i
do
well
to
be
angry
even
unto
death
he
had
learnt
to
look
at
colour
to
look
at
line
to
describe
pictures
but
far
more
important
than
this
he
could
now
create
in
the
imagination
gardens
and
sunsets
and
sheer
colour
so
as
to
give
to
his
novels
and
stories
pictorial
value
to
his
fantasies
glow
and
to
his
poetry
vision
of
the
realities
of
things
in
his
very
first
volume
of
essays
were
to
be
passages
that
could
be
written
only
by
one
who
had
learnt
to
draw
for
instance
in
a
defence
of
skeletons
the
actual
sight
of
the
little
wood
with
its
grey
and
silver
sea
of
life
is
entirely
a
winter
vision
so
dim
and
delicate
is
the
heart
of
the
winter
woods
a
kind
of
glittering
gloaming
that
a
figure
stepping
towards
us
in
the
chequered
twilight
seems
as
if
he
were
breaking
through
unfathomable
depths
of
spiders
webs
in
the
year
in
which
left
art
for
publishing
he
came
of
age
with
a
loud
report
he
writes
to
bentley
being
years
old
is
really
rather
good
fun
it
is
one
of
those
occasions
when
you
remember
the
existence
of
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
people
a
cousin
of
mine
alice
chesterton
daughter
of
my
uncle
arthur
writes
me
a
delightfully
cordial
letter
from
berlin
where
she
is
a
governess
and
better
still
my
mother
has
received
a
most
amusing
letter
from
an
old
nurse
of
mine
an
exceptionally
nice
and
intelligent
nurse
who
writes
on
hearing
that
it
is
my
birthday
billy
an
epithet
is
suppressed
gave
me
a
little
notebook
and
a
little
photograph
frame
the
first
thing
i
did
with
the
notebook
was
to
make
a
note
of
his
birthday
the
first
thing
i
shall
do
with
the
frame
will
be
to
get
grey
to
give
me
a
photograph
of
him
to
put
into
it
yes
it
is
not
bad
being
in
a
world
so
full
of
kind
people
i
have
just
been
out
and
got
soaking
and
dripping
wet
one
of
my
favourite
dissipations
i
never
enjoy
weather
so
much
as
when
it
is
driving
drenching
rattling
washing
rain
as
meredith
says
in
the
book
you
gave
me
rain
o
the
glad
refresher
of
the
grain
and
welcome
waterspouts
of
blessed
rain
it
is
in
a
poem
called
earth
and
a
wedded
woman
which
is
fat
seldom
have
i
enjoyed
a
walk
so
much
my
sister
water
was
all
there
and
most
affectionate
everything
i
passed
was
lovely
a
little
boy
pickabacking
another
little
boy
home
two
little
girls
taking
shelter
with
a
gigantic
umbrella
the
gutters
boiling
like
rivers
and
the
hedges
glittering
with
rain
and
when
i
came
to
our
corner
the
shower
was
over
and
there
was
a
great
watery
sunset
right
over
no
what
ruskin
calls
an
opening
into
eternity
eternity
is
pink
and
gold
this
may
seem
a
very
strange
rant
but
it
is
one
of
my
specimen
days
i
suppose
you
would
really
prefer
me
to
write
as
i
feel
and
i
am
so
constituted
that
these
daily
incidents
get
me
that
way
yes
i
like
rain
it
means
something
i
am
not
sure
what
something
freshening
cleaning
washing
out
taking
in
hand
not
robust
noisy
moral
wet
it
is
the
baptism
of
the
church
of
the
future
yesterday
afternoon
sunday
lawrence
and
maurice
came
here
we
were
merely
infants
at
play
had
skipping
races
round
the
garden
and
otherwise
raced
runner
run
thy
race
said
confucius
and
in
the
running
find
strength
and
reward
after
that
we
tried
talking
about
magnus
and
came
to
some
hopeful
conclusions
magnus
is
all
right
as
for
lawrence
and
grey
if
there
is
anything
righter
than
all
right
they
are
that
there
is
an
expression
in
meredith
book
which
struck
me
immensely
the
largeness
of
the
evening
earth
the
sensation
that
the
cosmos
has
all
its
windows
open
is
very
characteristic
of
evening
just
as
it
is
at
this
moment
i
feel
very
good
everything
out
of
the
window
looks
very
very
flat
and
yellow
i
do
not
know
how
else
to
describe
it
it
is
like
the
benediction
at
the
end
of
the
service
chapter
v
the
notebook
i
am
writing
this
chapter
at
a
table
facing
notre
dame
de
paris
in
front
of
a
café
filled
with
arguing
french
workmen
in
the
presence
of
god
and
of
man
and
i
feel
as
if
i
understood
the
one
hatred
of
life
his
loathing
of
pessimism
is
a
man
proud
of
losing
his
hearing
eyesight
or
sense
of
smell
what
shall
we
say
of
him
who
prides
himself
on
beginning
as
an
intellectual
cripple
and
ending
as
an
intellectual
corpse
from
some
prophecies
woe
unto
them
that
keep
a
god
like
a
silk
hat
that
believe
not
in
god
but
in
a
god
woe
unto
them
that
are
pompous
for
they
will
sooner
or
later
be
ridiculous
woe
unto
them
that
are
tired
of
everything
for
everything
will
certainly
be
tired
of
them
woe
unto
them
that
cast
out
everything
for
out
of
everything
they
will
be
cast
out
woe
unto
them
that
cast
out
anything
for
out
of
that
thing
they
will
be
cast
out
woe
unto
the
flippant
for
they
shall
receive
flippancy
woe
unto
them
that
are
scornful
for
they
shall
receive
scorn
woe
unto
him
that
considereth
his
hair
foolishly
for
his
hair
will
be
made
the
type
of
him
woe
unto
him
that
is
smart
for
men
will
hold
him
smart
always
even
when
he
is
serious
ibid
a
pessimist
is
a
man
who
has
never
lived
never
suffered
show
me
a
person
who
has
plenty
of
worries
and
troubles
and
i
will
show
you
a
person
who
whatever
he
is
is
not
a
pessimist
this
idea
developed
later
in
the
dealing
with
the
alleged
of
dickens
dickens
who
if
he
had
learnt
to
whitewash
the
universe
had
learnt
it
in
a
blacking
factory
dickens
who
had
learnt
through
hardship
and
suffering
to
accept
and
love
the
universe
but
that
he
wrote
later
the
quotations
given
here
come
from
the
notebook
begun
in
and
used
at
intervals
for
the
next
four
or
five
years
in
which
gilbert
wrote
down
his
philosophy
step
by
step
as
he
came
to
discover
it
the
handwriting
is
the
work
of
art
that
he
must
have
learnt
and
practised
so
different
is
it
from
his
boyhood
scrawl
each
idea
is
set
down
as
it
comes
into
his
mind
there
is
no
sequence
in
this
book
and
in
coloured
may
be
seen
the
creation
of
the
chesterton
view
of
life
and
it
all
took
place
in
his
early
twenties
from
the
here
and
the
rest
were
to
grow
here
they
are
only
seeds
but
seeds
containing
unmistakably
the
flower
of
the
future
they
should
not
hear
from
me
a
word
of
selfishness
or
scorn
if
only
i
could
find
the
door
if
only
i
were
born
he
makes
the
unborn
babe
say
this
in
his
first
volume
of
poems
and
in
the
notebook
we
see
how
the
babe
coming
into
the
world
must
keep
this
promise
by
accepting
life
with
its
puzzles
its
beauty
its
fleetingness
are
we
all
dust
what
a
beautiful
thing
dust
is
though
this
round
earth
may
be
a
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
are
some
pretty
colours
on
it
what
is
the
good
of
life
it
is
fleeting
what
is
the
good
of
a
cup
of
coffee
it
is
fleeting
ha
ha
ha
the
birthday
present
of
birth
as
he
was
later
to
call
it
in
involved
not
bare
existence
only
but
a
wealth
of
other
gifts
a
grievance
he
heads
this
thought
give
me
a
little
time
i
shall
not
be
able
to
appreciate
them
all
if
you
open
so
many
doors
and
give
me
so
many
presents
o
lord
god
he
is
almost
overwhelmed
with
all
that
he
has
and
with
all
that
is
but
accepts
it
ardently
in
its
completeness
if
the
arms
of
a
man
could
be
a
fiery
circle
embracing
the
round
world
i
think
i
should
be
that
man
yet
in
the
face
of
all
this
splendour
the
pessimist
dares
to
find
flaws
the
mountains
praise
thee
o
lord
but
what
if
a
mountain
said
i
praise
thee
but
put
a
halfway
up
on
the
left
it
would
be
much
more
effective
believe
me
it
is
time
that
the
religion
of
prayer
gave
place
to
the
religion
of
praise
if
the
mountains
must
praise
god
if
the
religion
of
praise
expresses
the
truth
of
things
how
much
more
does
it
express
the
truth
of
humanity
or
rather
of
men
for
he
saw
humanity
not
as
an
abstraction
but
as
the
sum
of
human
and
intensely
individual
beings
once
i
found
a
friend
dear
me
i
said
he
was
made
for
me
but
now
i
find
more
and
more
friends
who
seem
to
have
been
made
for
me
and
more
and
yet
more
made
for
me
is
it
possible
we
were
all
made
for
each
other
all
over
the
world
and
on
another
page
comes
perhaps
the
most
significant
phrase
in
the
book
i
wonder
whether
there
will
ever
come
a
time
when
i
shall
be
tired
of
any
one
person
hence
a
fantastic
thought
of
a
way
of
making
the
discovery
of
more
people
to
know
and
to
like
the
human
circulating
library
notes
get
out
a
gentleman
for
a
fortnight
then
change
him
for
a
lady
or
your
ticket
no
person
to
be
kept
out
after
a
fortnight
except
with
the
payment
of
a
penny
a
day
any
person
morally
or
physically
damaging
a
man
will
be
held
responsible
the
library
omnibus
calls
once
a
week
leaving
two
or
three
each
visit
man
of
the
season
old
standard
man
or
better
still
my
great
ambition
is
to
give
a
party
at
which
everybody
should
meet
everybody
else
and
like
them
very
much
an
invitation
gilbert
chesterton
requests
the
pleasure
of
humanity
company
to
tea
on
humanity
the
earth
cosmos
liked
everybody
very
much
and
everything
very
much
he
liked
even
the
things
most
of
us
dislike
he
liked
to
get
wet
he
liked
to
be
tired
after
that
one
short
period
of
struggle
he
liked
to
call
himself
always
perfectly
happy
and
therefore
he
wanted
to
say
thank
you
you
say
grace
before
meals
all
right
but
i
say
grace
before
the
play
and
the
opera
and
grace
before
the
concert
and
pantomime
and
grace
before
i
open
a
book
and
grace
before
sketching
painting
swimming
fencing
boxing
walking
playing
dancing
and
grace
before
i
dip
the
pen
in
the
ink
each
day
seemed
a
special
gift
something
that
might
not
have
been
evening
here
dies
another
day
during
which
i
have
had
eyes
ears
hands
and
the
great
world
round
me
and
with
tomorrow
begins
another
why
am
i
allowed
two
the
prayer
of
a
man
walking
i
thank
thee
o
lord
for
the
stones
in
the
street
i
thank
thee
for
the
yonder
and
for
the
houses
built
and
that
fly
past
me
as
i
stride
but
most
of
all
for
the
great
wind
in
my
nostrils
as
if
thine
own
nostrils
were
close
the
prayer
of
a
man
resting
the
twilight
closes
round
me
my
head
is
bowed
before
the
universe
i
thank
thee
o
lord
for
a
child
i
knew
seven
years
ago
and
whom
i
have
never
seen
since
praised
be
god
for
all
sides
of
life
for
friends
lovers
art
literature
knowledge
humour
politics
and
for
the
little
red
cloud
away
there
in
the
west
for
if
he
was
to
be
grateful
to
whom
did
he
owe
gratitude
here
is
the
chief
question
he
asked
and
answered
at
this
time
at
school
he
was
looking
for
god
but
at
the
age
of
he
was
he
tells
us
in
an
agnostic
in
the
sense
of
one
who
is
not
sure
one
way
or
the
other
largely
it
was
this
need
for
gratitude
for
what
seemed
personal
gifts
that
brought
him
to
belief
in
a
personal
god
life
was
personal
it
was
not
a
mere
drift
it
had
will
in
it
it
was
more
like
a
story
a
story
is
the
highest
mark
for
the
world
is
a
story
and
every
part
of
it
and
there
is
nothing
that
can
touch
the
world
or
any
part
of
it
that
is
not
a
story
and
again
with
the
heading
a
social
situation
we
must
certainly
be
in
a
novel
what
i
like
about
this
novelist
is
that
he
takes
such
trouble
about
his
minor
characters
the
story
shapes
from
man
birth
and
it
is
as
he
meets
the
other
characters
that
he
finds
he
is
in
the
right
story
a
man
born
on
the
earth
perhaps
there
has
been
some
mistake
how
does
he
know
he
has
come
to
the
right
place
but
when
he
finds
friends
he
knows
he
has
come
to
the
right
place
you
say
it
is
a
love
affair
hush
it
is
a
new
garden
of
eden
and
a
new
progeny
will
people
a
new
earth
god
is
always
making
these
experiments
life
is
a
story
who
tells
it
life
is
a
problem
who
sets
it
the
world
is
a
problem
not
a
theorem
and
the
word
of
the
last
day
will
be
god
sets
the
problem
god
tells
the
story
but
can
those
know
him
who
are
characters
in
his
story
who
are
working
out
his
problem
have
you
ever
known
what
it
is
to
walk
along
a
road
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
that
you
thought
you
might
meet
god
at
any
turn
of
the
path
for
this
a
man
must
be
ready
against
this
he
must
never
shut
the
door
there
is
one
kind
of
infidelity
blacker
than
all
infidelities
worse
than
any
blow
of
secularist
pessimist
atheist
it
is
that
of
those
persons
who
regard
god
as
an
old
institution
voices
the
axe
falls
on
the
wood
in
thuds
god
god
the
cry
of
the
rook
god
answers
it
the
crack
of
the
fire
on
the
hearth
the
voice
of
the
brook
say
the
same
name
all
things

cat
fiddle
baby
wind
breaker
sea
thunderclap
repeat
in
a
thousand
languages
god
next
in
his
thought
comes
a
point
where
he
hesitates
as
to
the
meeting
place
between
god
and
man
how
and
where
can
these
two
incommensurates
find
a
meeting
place
what
is
incarnation
the
greatness
and
the
littleness
of
man
obsessed
chesterton
as
it
did
pascal
it
is
the
eternal
riddle
two
strands
man
is
a
spark
flying
upwards
god
is
everlasting
who
are
we
to
whom
this
cup
of
human
life
has
been
given
to
ask
for
more
let
us
love
mercy
and
walk
humbly
what
is
man
that
thou
regardest
him
man
is
a
star
unquenchable
god
is
in
him
incarnate
his
life
is
planned
upon
a
scale
colossal
of
which
he
sees
glimpses
let
him
dare
all
things
claim
all
things
he
is
the
son
of
man
who
shall
come
in
the
clouds
of
glory
i
saw
these
two
strands
mingling
to
make
the
religion
of
man
a
scale
colossal
of
which
he
sees
glimpses
this
i
think
is
the
first
hint
of
the
path
that
led
gilbert
to
full
faith
in
our
lord
in
places
in
these
notes
he
regards
him
certainly
only
as
man
but
even
then
as
man
the
man
in
whom
the
colossal
scale
the
immense
possibilities
of
human
nature
could
be
dreamed
of
as
fulfilled
two
notes
on
marcus
aurelius
are
significant
of
the
way
his
mind
was
moving
marcus
aurelius
a
strong
man
following
the
better
thing
like
a
thread
between
his
hands
him
we
can
not
fancy
choosing
the
lower
even
by
mistake
we
can
not
think
of
him
as
wanting
for
a
moment
in
any
virtue
sincerity
mercy
purity
good
manners
only
one
thing
is
wanting
in
him
he
does
not
command
me
to
perform
the
impossible
the
carpenter
the
meditations
of
marcus
aurelius
yes
he
was
soliloquising
not
making
something
do
not
the
words
of
jesus
ring
like
nails
knocked
into
a
board
in
his
father
workshop
on
two
consecutive
pages
are
notes
showing
how
his
mind
is
wrestling
with
the
question
the
answer
to
which
would
complete
his
philosophy
xmas
day
good
news
but
if
you
ask
me
what
it
is
i
know
not
it
is
a
track
of
feet
in
the
snow
it
is
a
lantern
showing
a
path
it
is
a
door
set
open
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
i
live
in
an
age
of
varied
powers
and
knowledge
of
steam
science
democracy
journalism
art
but
when
my
love
rises
like
a
sea
i
have
to
go
back
to
an
obscure
tribe
and
a
slain
man
to
formulate
a
blessing
julian
vicisti
galilæe
he
said
and
sank
conquered
after
wrestling
with
the
most
gigantic
of
powers
a
dead
man
the
crucified
on
a
naked
slope
of
a
poor
province
a
roman
soldier
stood
staring
at
a
gibbet
then
he
said
surely
this
was
a
righteous
man
and
a
new
chapter
of
history
opened
having
that
for
its
motto
parables
there
was
a
man
who
dwelt
in
the
east
centuries
ago
and
now
i
can
not
look
at
a
sheep
or
a
sparrow
a
lily
or
a
cornfield
a
raven
or
a
sunset
a
vineyard
or
a
mountain
without
thinking
of
him
if
this
be
not
to
be
divine
what
is
it
cecil
chesterton
tells
us
gilbert
read
the
gospels
partly
because
he
was
not
forced
to
read
them
i
suppose
this
really
means
that
he
read
them
with
a
mature
mind
which
had
not
been
dulled
to
their
reception
by
a
childhood
task
of
routine
lessons
but
i
do
not
think
at
this
date
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
question
the
assumption
of
the
period
that
official
christianity
its
priesthood
especially
had
travestied
the
original
intention
of
christ
this
idea
is
in
the
volume
published
in
and
more
briefly
in
a
suggestion
in
the
notebook
for
a
proposed
drama
gabriel
is
hammering
up
a
little
theatre
and
the
child
looks
at
his
hands
and
finds
them
torn
with
nails
the
church
should
stand
by
the
powers
that
be
yes
that
is
a
handsome
crucifix
you
have
there
at
your
chain
that
the
clergy
that
the
christian
people
should
have
settled
down
to
an
acceptance
of
a
faulty
established
order
should
not
be
alert
to
all
that
our
lord
life
signified
was
one
of
the
problems
it
was
too
a
matter
of
that
cosmic
loyalty
which
he
analyses
more
fully
in
here
he
simply
writes
it
is
not
a
question
of
theology
it
is
a
question
of
whether
placed
as
a
sentinel
of
an
unknown
watch
you
will
whistle
or
not
sentinels
do
go
to
sleep
and
he
was
coming
to
feel
that
this
want
of
vigilance
ran
through
the
whole
of
humanity
in
white
wynd
a
sketch
written
at
this
time
he
adumbrates
an
idea
to
which
he
was
to
return
again
in
especially
and
in
that
we
can
by
custom
so
lose
our
sense
of
reality
that
the
only
way
to
enjoy
and
be
grateful
for
our
possessions
is
to
lose
them
for
a
while
the
shortest
way
home
is
to
go
round
the
world
in
this
story
of
white
wynd
he
applies
the
parable
only
to
each
man
life
and
the
world
he
lives
in
but
in
he
applies
it
to
the
human
race
who
have
lost
revealed
truth
by
getting
so
accustomed
to
it
that
they
no
longer
look
at
it
and
already
in
the
notebook
he
is
calling
the
attention
of
a
careless
multitude
to
that
great
empire
upon
which
the
sun
never
sets
i
allude
to
the
universe
it
is
published
in
coloured
most
of
the
quotations
about
our
lord
come
in
the
later
part
of
the
book
in
the
earlier
pages
he
dreams
that
to
this
age
it
is
given
to
write
the
great
new
song
and
to
compile
the
new
bible
and
to
found
the
new
church
and
preach
the
new
religion
and
in
one
rather
obscure
passage
he
seems
to
hint
at
the
thought
that
christ
might
come
again
to
shape
this
new
religion
going
round
the
world
gilbert
was
finding
his
way
home
the
explorer
was
rediscovering
his
native
country
he
himself
has
given
us
all
the
metaphors
for
what
was
happening
now
in
his
mind
without
a
single
catholic
friend
he
had
discovered
this
wealth
of
catholic
truth
and
he
was
still
travelling
all
this
i
felt
he
later
summed
it
up
in
and
the
age
gave
me
no
encouragement
to
feel
it
and
all
this
time
i
had
not
even
thought
of
catholic
theology
chapter
vi
towards
a
career
a
curious
little
incident
comes
towards
the
end
of
gilbert
time
at
the
slade
school
in
a
letter
he
wrote
to
bentley
we
see
him
on
the
eve
of
his
birthday
being
invited
to
write
for
the
cotton
is
a
little
bristly
bohemian
man
as
fidgetty
as
a
kitten
who
runs
round
the
table
while
he
talks
to
you
when
he
agrees
with
you
he
shuts
his
eyes
tight
and
shakes
his
head
when
he
means
anything
rather
seriously
he
ends
up
with
a
loud
nervous
laugh
he
talks
incessantly
and
is
mad
on
the
history
of
oxford
i
sent
him
my
review
of
ruskin
and
he
read
it
before
me
note
hell
and
delivered
himself
with
astonishing
rapidity
to
the
following
effect
this
is
very
good
you
got
something
to
say
oh
yes
this
is
worth
saying
i
agree
with
you
about
ruskin
and
about
the
century
this
is
good
you
no
idea
if
you
saw
some
stuff
some
reviews
i
get
the
fellows
are
practised
but
of
all
the
damned
fools
you
no
idea
they
know
the
trade
in
a
way
but
such
infernal
asses
as
send
things
up
but
this
is
very
good
that
sentence
does
run
but
i
like
your
point
make
it
a
little
longer
and
then
send
it
in
i
got
another
book
for
you
to
review
you
know
robert
bridges
oh
very
good
very
good
here
it
is
about
two
columns
you
know
by
the
way
keep
the
ruskin
for
yourself
you
deserve
that
anyhow
here
i
got
a
word
in
one
of
protest
and
thanks
but
cotton
insisted
on
my
accepting
the
ruskin
so
i
am
really
to
serve
laban
laban
proves
on
analysis
to
be
of
the
consistency
of
brick
it
is
such
men
as
this
that
have
made
our
cosmos
what
it
is
at
one
point
he
said
literally
dancing
with
glee
oh
the
other
day
i
stuck
some
pins
into
andrew
lang
i
said
dear
me
that
must
be
a
very
good
game
it
was
something
about
an
edition
of
scott
but
i
was
told
that
andrew
took
the
painful
operation
very
well
we
sat
up
horribly
late
together
talking
about
browning
afghans
notes
the
yellow
book
the
french
revolution
william
morris
norsemen
and
richard
le
gallienne
i
do
despair
for
anyone
he
said
suddenly
hang
it
all
that
what
you
mean
by
humanity
this
appears
to
be
a
rather
good
editor
of
the
and
my
joy
in
having
begun
my
life
is
very
great
i
am
tired
i
said
to
brodribb
of
writing
only
what
i
like
oh
well
he
said
heartily
you
have
no
reason
to
make
that
complaint
in
journalism
but
here
is
a
mystery
nowhere
in
the
columns
for
or
are
to
be
seen
the
initials
yet
at
that
date
all
the
reviews
are
signed
eccles
who
was
writing
for
it
at
the
time
told
me
that
he
had
no
recollection
of
among
the
contributors
and
later
he
came
to
know
him
well
when
both
were
together
on
the
in
any
case
the
idea
of
reviewing
for
no
reward
except
the
book
reviewed
would
scarcely
appeal
to
a
more
practical
man
than
gilbert
as
a
hopeful
beginning
perhaps
the
mystery
is
solved
by
the
fact
that
soon
after
the
date
of
this
letter
cotton
got
an
appointment
in
india
to
eccles
it
appeared
somewhat
ironical
that
the
unpaid
contributors
to
the
were
circularised
with
a
suggestion
of
contributions
of
money
towards
a
parting
present
for
their
late
editor
the
actual
beginning
of
journalism
was
in
and
in
the
he
insists
that
it
was
a
matter
of
mere
luck
these
opportunities
were
merely
things
that
happened
to
me
while
still
at
the
slade
school
he
was
as
we
have
seen
attending
english
lectures
at
university
college
there
he
met
a
ernest
hodder
williams
of
the
family
which
controlled
the
publishing
house
of
hodder
stoughton
he
gave
chesterton
some
books
on
art
to
review
for
a
monthly
paper
published
by
the
firm
i
need
not
say
comments
that
having
entirely
failed
to
learn
how
to
draw
or
paint
i
tossed
off
easily
enough
some
criticisms
of
the
weaker
points
of
rubens
or
the
misdirected
talents
of
tintoretto
i
had
discovered
the
easiest
of
all
professions
which
i
have
pursued
ever
since
but
neither
in
the
art
criticism
he
wrote
for
nor
in
the
poems
he
was
to
publish
in
and
was
there
a
living
he
left
the
slade
school
and
went
to
work
for
a
publisher
redway
in
whose
office
gilbert
now
found
himself
was
a
publisher
largely
of
spiritualist
literature
gilbert
has
described
in
his
his
rather
curious
experience
of
ghostly
authorship
but
he
relates
nothing
of
his
office
experience
which
is
described
in
another
undated
letter
to
bentley
i
am
writing
this
letter
just
when
i
like
most
to
write
one
late
at
night
after
a
beastly
lot
of
midnight
oil
over
a
contribution
for
a
intended
as
a
public
venture
i
am
sending
them
a
recast
of
that
picture
of
tuesday
like
you
i
am
beastly
busy
but
there
is
something
exciting
about
it
if
i
must
be
busy
as
i
certainly
must
being
an
approximately
honest
man
i
had
much
rather
be
busy
in
a
varied
mixed
up
way
with
half
a
hundred
things
to
attend
to
than
with
one
blank
day
of
monotonous
study
before
me
to
give
you
some
idea
of
what
i
mean
i
have
been
engaged
in
different
tiring
occupations
and
enjoyed
them
all
redway
says
we
got
too
many
mss
read
through
them
will
you
and
send
back
those
that
are
too
bad
at
once
i
go
slap
through
a
room
full
of
mss
criticising
deuced
conscientiously
with
the
result
that
i
post
back
some
years
of
mss
to
addresses
which
i
should
imagine
must
be
private
asylums
but
one
feels
worried
somehow
redway
says
i
going
to
give
you
entire
charge
of
the
press
department
sending
copies
to
reviews
etc
consequence
is
one
has
to
keep
an
elaborate
book
and
make
it
tally
with
other
elaborate
books
and
one
has
to
remember
all
the
magazines
that
exist
and
what
sort
of
books
they
crack
up
i
used
to
think
i
hated
responsibility
i
am
positively
getting
to
enjoy
it
there
is
that
confounded
picture
of
tuesday
which
i
have
been
scribbling
at
the
whole
evening
and
have
at
last
got
it
presentable
this
sounds
like
mere
amusement
but
now
that
i
have
tried
other
kinds
of
hurry
and
bustle
i
solemnly
pledge
myself
to
the
opinion
that
there
is
no
work
so
tiring
as
writing
that
is
not
for
fun
but
for
publication
other
work
has
a
repetition
a
machinery
a
reflex
action
about
it
somewhere
but
to
be
on
the
stretch
inventing
fillings
making
them
out
of
nothing
making
them
as
good
as
you
can
for
a
matter
of
four
hours
leaves
me
more
inclined
to
lie
down
and
read
dickens
than
i
ever
feel
after
nine
hours
ramp
at
redway
the
worst
of
it
is
that
you
always
think
the
thing
so
bad
too
when
you
in
that
state
i
ca
imagine
anything
more
idiotic
than
what
i
just
finished
well
enough
of
work
and
all
its
works
by
all
means
come
on
monday
evening
but
do
be
frightened
if
by
any
chance
i
not
in
till
about
as
monday
is
a
busy
day
of
course
you
stop
to
dinner
what
an
idiotically
long
time
weeks
is
this
letter
does
not
seem
to
bear
out
the
suggestion
in
cecil
of
gilbert
probable
uselessness
to
the
publishers
for
whom
he
worked
after
all
literacy
is
more
needful
to
most
publishers
than
automatic
practicality
because
it
is
so
very
much
rarer
probably
would
have
been
absolutely
invaluable
had
he
been
a
little
less
his
dislike
of
sending
back
a
manuscript
and
making
an
author
unhappy
would
have
been
a
bar
to
his
utility
as
a
reader
but
there
are
lots
of
other
things
to
do
besides
rejecting
manuscripts
and
two
later
letters
show
how
capable
gilbert
was
felt
to
be
in
doing
most
of
them
chesterton
a
see
p
the
exact
date
at
which
he
left
redway
for
the
publishing
firm
of
fisher
unwin
of
paternoster
buildings
i
can
not
discover
but
it
was
fairly
early
and
he
was
several
years
with
fisher
unwin
only
gradually
beginning
to
move
over
into
journalism
he
did
nothing
for
himself
says
lucian
oldershaw
till
we
bentley
and
oldershaw
came
down
from
oxford
and
pushed
him
the
following
letters
belong
to
being
written
to
frances
when
they
were
already
engaged
but
i
put
them
here
as
they
give
some
notion
of
the
work
he
did
for
his
employer
the
book
i
have
to
deal
with
for
unwin
is
an
exhaustive
and
i
am
told
interesting
work
on
rome
and
the
empire
a
kind
of
realistic
modern
account
of
the
life
of
the
ancient
world
i
have
got
to
fix
it
up
choose
illustrations
introductions
notes
and
all
because
i
am
the
only
person
who
knows
a
little
latin
and
precious
little
roman
history
and
no
more
archaeology
than
a
blind
cat
it
is
entertaining
and
just
like
our
firm
casual
way
the
work
ought
to
be
done
by
an
authority
on
roman
antiquities
if
i
had
been
there
they
would
have
given
it
to
the
office
boy
however
i
shall
get
through
it
all
right
the
more
i
see
of
the
publishing
world
the
more
i
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
know
next
to
nothing
but
that
the
vast
mass
of
literary
people
know
less
this
is
sometimes
called
having
a
education
extract
from
undated
letter
postmarked
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
as
unwin
has
given
the
production
of
an
important
book
entirely
into
my
hands
as
a
kind
of
invisible
editor
it
is
complimentary
but
very
worrying
and
will
mean
a
lot
of
time
at
the
british
museum
extract
from
undated
letter
postmarked
paternoster
bldgs
postmark
december
for
fear
that
you
should
really
suppose
that
my
observations
about
being
busy
are
the
subterfuges
of
a
habitual
liar
i
may
give
you
briefly
some
idea
of
the
irons
at
present
in
the
fire
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
there
are
at
least
seven
things
that
i
have
undertaken
to
do
and
everyone
of
them
i
ought
to
do
before
any
of
the
others
there
is
the
book
about
ancient
rome
which
i
have
to
do
for
arrange
and
get
illustrations
etc
this
all
comes
of
showing
off
it
is
a
story
with
a
moral
greedy
gilbert
or
little
boys
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
a
short
time
ago
i
had
to
read
a
treatise
by
dean
stubbs
on
the
ideal
woman
of
the
poets
in
which
the
dean
remarked
that
all
the
women
admired
by
horace
were
wantons
this
struck
me
as
a
downright
slander
slight
as
is
my
classical
knowledge
and
in
my
report
i
asked
loftily
what
dean
stubbs
made
of
those
noble
lines
on
the
wife
who
hid
her
husband
from
his
foes
mendax
et
in
omne
virgo
nobilis
one
of
the
purest
and
stateliest
tributes
ever
made
to
a
woman
the
lines
might
be
roughly
rendered
a
magnificent
liar
and
a
noble
lady
for
all
eternity
but
no
translation
can
convey
the
of
the
verse
in
which
the
two
strong
and
lonely
words
noble
and
eternity
stand
solitary
for
the
last
line
in
consequence
of
my
taking
up
the
cudgels
against
a
live
dean
for
the
manly
moral
sense
of
the
dear
old
epicurean
the
office
became
impressed
with
a
vague
idea
that
i
know
something
about
latin
literature
whereas
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
forgotten
even
the
line
before
the
one
i
quoted
however
in
the
most
confidential
and
pathetic
manner
i
was
entrusted
with
doing
with
rome
et
work
which
ought
to
be
done
by
a
scholar
then
there
is
captain
webster
you
ask
in
gruff
rumbling
tones
who
is
captain
webster
i
will
tell
you
captain
webster
is
a
small
man
with
a
carefully
waxed
moustache
and
a
very
bond
street
get
up
living
at
the
grosvenor
hotel
talking
to
him
you
would
say
he
is
an
ass
but
an
agreeable
ass
a
humble
transparent
honourable
ass
he
is
an
innocent
and
idiotic
butterfly
the
interesting
finishing
touch
is
that
he
has
been
to
new
guinea
for
four
years
or
so
and
had
some
of
the
most
hideous
and
extravagant
adventures
that
could
befall
a
modern
man
his
yacht
was
surrounded
by
shoals
of
canoes
full
of
myriads
of
cannibals
of
a
race
who
file
their
teeth
to
look
like
the
teeth
of
dogs
and
hang
weights
in
their
ears
till
the
ears
hang
like
dogs
ears
on
the
shoulder
he
held
his
yacht
at
the
point
of
the
revolver
and
got
away
leaving
some
of
his
men
dead
on
the
shore
all
night
long
he
heard
the
horrible
noise
of
the
banqueting
gongs
and
saw
the
huge
fires
that
told
his
friends
were
being
eaten
now
he
lives
in
the
grosvenor
hotel
captain
webster
finds
the
pen
not
only
mightier
than
the
sword
but
also
much
more
difficult
he
has
written
his
adventures
and
we
are
to
publish
them
and
i
am
translating
the
honest
captain
into
english
grammar
a
thing
which
appals
him
much
more
than
papuan
savages
this
means
going
through
it
carefully
of
course
and
rewriting
many
parts
of
it
where
relatives
and
dependent
sentences
have
been
lost
past
recovery
i
went
to
see
him
and
his
childlike
dependence
on
me
was
quite
pathetic
his
general
attitude
was
you
see
i
such
a
damned
fool
and
so
he
is
but
when
i
compare
him
with
the
balzacian
hauteur
and
the
preposterous
posing
of
many
of
our
fleet
street
decadent
geniuses
i
feel
a
movement
of
the
blood
which
declares
that
perhaps
there
are
worse
things
than
war
between
ourselves
i
have
a
sneaking
sympathy
with
fighting
i
fought
horribly
at
school
it
is
well
you
should
know
my
illogicalities
there
is
the
selection
of
illustrations
for
the
history
of
china
we
are
producing
i
know
no
more
of
china
than
the
man
in
the
moon
less
for
he
has
seen
it
at
any
rate
except
what
i
got
from
reading
the
book
but
of
course
i
shall
make
the
most
of
what
i
do
know
and
airily
talk
of
and
criticise
and
compare
tchieu
lung
with
his
great
successor
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
and
the
napoleonic
vigour
of
li
with
the
weak
opportunism
of
woo
before
i
have
done
i
hope
people
will
be
looking
behind
for
my
the
name
i
shall
adopt
will
be
a
ms
to
read
translated
from
the
norwegian
a
history
of
the
kiss
ceremonial
amicable
amatory
in
the
worst
french
sentimental
style
god
alone
knows
how
angry
i
am
with
the
author
of
that
book
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
not
send
up
the
brief
report
a
snivelling
hound
the
book
for
nutt
at
which
has
reached
its
worst
stage
that
of
polishing
up
for
the
eye
of
nutt
instead
of
merely
rejoicing
in
the
eye
of
god
do
you
know
this
is
the
only
one
of
the
lot
about
which
i
am
at
all
worried
i
do
not
feel
as
if
things
like
the
fish
poem
are
really
worth
publishing
i
know
they
are
better
than
many
books
that
are
published
but
heaven
knows
that
is
not
saying
much
in
support
of
some
of
my
work
i
would
fight
to
the
last
but
with
regard
to
this
occasional
verse
i
feel
a
humbug
to
publish
a
book
of
my
nonsense
verses
seems
to
me
exactly
like
summoning
the
whole
of
the
people
of
kensington
to
see
me
smoke
cigarettes
macgregor
told
me
that
i
should
do
much
better
in
the
business
of
literature
if
i
found
the
work
more
difficult
my
facility
he
said
led
me
to
undervalue
my
work
i
wonder
whether
this
is
true
and
those
silly
rhymes
are
any
good
after
all
the
collection
of
more
serious
poems
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
you
shall
have
a
hand
in
the
selection
of
these
when
you
get
back
the
novel
which
though
i
have
put
it
aside
for
the
present
yet
has
become
too
much
a
part
of
me
not
to
be
constantly
having
chapters
written
or
rather
growing
out
of
the
others
and
all
these
things
with
the
exception
of
the
last
one
are
supposed
to
be
really
urgent
and
to
be
done
immediately
now
i
hope
i
have
sickened
you
forever
of
wanting
to
know
the
details
of
my
dull
affairs
but
i
hope
it
may
give
you
some
notion
of
how
hard
it
really
is
to
get
time
for
writing
just
now
for
you
see
they
are
none
of
them
even
mechanical
things
they
all
require
some
thinking
about
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
really
want
to
know
what
i
do
you
must
forgive
me
for
seeming
egoistic
that
is
the
tragedy
of
the
literary
person
his
very
existence
is
an
assertion
of
his
own
mental
vanity
he
must
pretend
to
be
conceited
even
if
he
is
beginning
to
publish
beginning
to
write
and
still
developing
mentally
at
a
frantic
rate
this
is
a
summary
of
the
years
as
the
notebook
shows
gilbert
was
reflecting
deeply
at
this
time
on
the
relations
both
between
god
and
man
and
between
man
and
his
fellow
man
the
realisation
that
their
relations
had
gone
very
far
wrong
was
necessarily
followed
for
gilbert
was
an
immensely
practical
one
by
the
question
of
what
the
proposed
remedies
were
worth
he
has
told
us
that
he
became
a
socialist
at
this
time
only
because
it
was
intolerable
not
to
be
a
socialist
the
socialists
seemed
the
only
people
who
were
looking
at
conditions
as
they
were
and
finding
them
unendurable
christian
socialism
seemed
at
first
sight
for
anyone
who
admired
christ
to
be
the
obvious
form
of
socialism
and
in
a
fragment
of
this
period
traces
the
resemblance
of
modern
collectivism
to
early
christianity
the
points
in
which
christian
and
socialistic
collectivism
are
at
one
are
simple
and
fundamental
as
however
we
must
proceed
carefully
in
this
matter
we
may
state
these
points
of
resemblance
under
three
heads
both
rise
from
the
deeps
of
an
emotion
the
emotion
of
compassion
for
misfortune
as
such
this
is
really
a
very
important
point
collectivism
is
not
an
intellectual
fad
even
if
erroneous
but
a
passionate
protest
and
aspiration
it
arises
as
a
secret
of
the
heart
a
dream
of
the
injured
feeling
long
before
it
shapes
itself
as
a
definite
propaganda
at
all
the
intellectual
philosophies
ally
themselves
with
success
and
preach
competition
but
the
human
heart
allies
itself
with
misfortune
and
suggests
communism
both
trace
the
evil
state
of
society
to
covetousness
the
competitive
desire
to
accumulate
riches
thus
both
in
one
case
and
the
other
the
mere
possession
of
wealth
is
in
itself
an
offence
against
moral
order
the
absence
of
it
in
itself
a
recommendation
and
training
for
the
higher
life
both
propose
to
remedy
the
evil
of
competition
by
a
system
of
bearing
each
other
burdens
in
the
literal
sense
that
is
to
say
of
levelling
silencing
and
reducing
one
own
chances
for
the
chance
of
your
weaker
brethren
the
desirability
they
say
of
a
great
or
clever
man
acquiring
fame
is
small
compared
with
the
desirability
of
a
weak
and
broken
man
acquiring
bread
the
strong
man
is
a
man
and
should
modify
or
adapt
himself
to
the
hopes
of
his
mates
he
that
would
be
first
among
you
let
him
be
the
servant
of
all
these
are
the
three
fountains
of
collectivist
passion
i
have
not
considered
it
necessary
to
enter
into
elaborate
proof
of
the
presence
of
these
three
in
the
gospels
that
the
main
trend
of
character
was
compassion
for
human
ills
that
he
denounced
not
merely
covetousness
but
riches
again
and
again
and
with
an
almost
impatient
emphasis
and
that
he
insisted
on
his
followers
throwing
up
personal
aims
and
sharing
funds
and
fortune
entirely
these
are
plain
matters
of
evidence
presented
again
and
again
and
in
fact
of
common
admission
yet
that
uncanny
thing
in
gilbert
which
always
forced
him
to
see
facts
mutinied
again
at
this
point
and
produced
another
fragment
in
which
he
has
moved
closer
to
christianity
and
thereby
further
away
from
modern
socialism
the
world
he
lived
in
contained
a
certain
number
of
christians
who
were
he
found
highly
doubtful
about
the
christian
impulse
of
socialism
and
most
of
his
socialist
friends
had
about
them
a
tone
of
bitterness
and
an
atmosphere
of
hopelessness
utterly
unlike
the
tone
and
the
atmosphere
of
christianity
just
as
atheists
were
the
first
people
to
turn
gilbert
from
atheism
towards
dogmatic
christianity
so
the
socialists
were
now
turning
him
from
socialism
the
next
fragment
is
rather
long
but
it
was
never
published
and
i
think
it
so
important
as
showing
how
his
mind
was
moving
that
it
can
not
well
be
shortened
it
is
a
document
of
capital
importance
for
the
biography
of
chesterton
now
for
my
own
part
i
can
not
in
the
least
agree
with
those
who
see
no
difference
between
christian
and
modern
socialism
nor
do
i
for
a
moment
join
in
some
christian
socialists
denunciations
of
those
worthy
people
who
can
not
see
the
connection
for
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
in
a
way
these
latter
people
are
right
no
reasonable
man
can
read
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
think
that
its
tone
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
most
collectivist
speculation
of
the
present
day
and
the
philistines
feel
this
though
they
can
not
distinctly
express
it
there
is
a
difference
between
socialist
program
and
that
of
our
own
time
a
difference
deep
genuine
and
all
important
and
it
is
this
which
i
wish
to
point
out
let
us
take
two
types
side
by
side
or
rather
the
same
type
in
the
two
different
atmospheres
let
us
take
the
rich
young
man
of
the
gospels
and
place
beside
him
the
rich
young
man
of
the
present
day
on
the
threshold
of
socialism
if
we
were
to
follow
the
difficulties
theories
doubts
resolves
and
conclusions
of
each
of
these
characters
we
should
find
two
very
distinct
threads
of
running
through
the
two
lives
and
the
essence
of
the
difference
was
this
the
modern
socialist
is
saying
what
will
society
do
while
his
prototype
as
we
read
said
what
shall
i
do
properly
considered
this
latter
sentence
contains
the
whole
essence
of
the
older
communism
the
modern
socialist
regards
his
theory
of
regeneration
as
a
duty
which
society
owes
to
him
the
early
christian
regarded
it
as
a
duty
which
he
owed
to
society
the
modern
socialist
is
busy
framing
schemes
for
its
fulfilment
the
early
christian
was
busy
considering
whether
he
would
himself
fulfil
it
there
and
then
the
ideal
of
modern
socialism
is
an
elaborate
utopia
to
which
he
hopes
the
world
may
be
tending
the
ideal
of
the
early
christian
was
an
actual
nucleus
living
the
new
life
to
whom
he
might
join
himself
if
he
liked
hence
the
constant
note
running
through
the
whole
gospel
of
the
importance
difficulty
and
excitement
of
the
call
the
individual
and
practical
request
made
by
christ
to
every
rich
man
sell
all
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
to
us
socialism
comes
speculatively
as
a
noble
and
optimistic
theory
of
what
may
be
the
crown
of
progress
to
peter
and
james
and
john
it
came
practically
as
a
crisis
of
their
own
daily
life
a
stirring
question
of
conduct
and
renunciation
we
do
not
therefore
in
the
least
agree
with
those
who
hold
that
modern
socialism
is
an
exact
counterpart
or
fulfilment
of
the
socialism
of
christianity
we
find
the
difference
important
and
profound
despite
the
common
ground
of
collectivism
the
modern
socialist
regards
communism
as
a
distant
panacea
for
society
the
early
christian
regarded
it
as
an
immediate
and
difficult
regeneration
of
himself
the
modern
socialist
reviles
or
at
any
rate
reproaches
society
for
not
adopting
it
the
early
christian
concentrated
his
thoughts
on
the
problem
of
his
own
fitness
and
unfitness
to
adopt
it
to
the
modern
socialist
it
is
a
theory
to
the
early
christian
it
was
a
call
modern
socialism
says
elaborate
a
broad
noble
and
workable
system
and
submit
it
to
the
progressive
intellect
of
society
early
christianity
said
sell
all
thou
hast
and
give
to
the
poor
this
distinction
between
the
social
and
personal
way
of
regarding
the
change
has
two
sides
a
spiritual
and
a
practical
which
we
propose
to
notice
the
spiritual
side
of
it
though
of
less
direct
and
revolutionary
importance
than
the
practical
has
still
a
very
profound
philosophic
significance
to
us
it
appears
something
extraordinary
that
this
christian
side
of
socialism
the
side
of
the
difficulty
of
the
personal
sacrifice
and
the
patience
cheerfulness
and
good
temper
necessary
for
the
protracted
personal
surrender
is
so
constantly
overlooked
the
literary
world
is
flooded
with
old
men
seeing
visions
and
young
men
dreaming
dreams
with
various
stages
of
enthusiasm
with
economic
apocalypses
elaborate
utopias
and
mushroom
destinies
of
mankind
and
as
far
as
we
have
seen
in
all
this
whirlwind
of
theoretic
excitement
there
is
not
a
word
spoken
of
the
intense
practical
difficulty
of
the
summons
to
the
individual
the
heavy
unrewarding
cross
borne
by
him
who
gives
up
the
world
for
it
will
not
surely
be
denied
that
not
only
will
socialism
be
impossible
without
some
effort
on
the
part
of
individuals
but
that
socialism
if
once
established
would
be
rapidly
dissolved
or
worse
still
diseased
if
the
individual
members
of
the
community
did
not
make
a
constant
effort
to
do
that
which
in
the
present
state
of
human
nature
must
mean
an
effort
to
live
the
higher
life
mere
state
systems
could
not
bring
about
and
still
less
sustain
a
reign
of
unselfishness
without
a
cheerful
decision
on
the
part
of
the
members
to
forget
selfishness
even
in
little
things
and
for
that
most
difficult
and
at
the
same
time
most
important
personal
decision
christ
made
provision
and
the
modern
theorists
make
no
provision
at
all
some
modern
socialists
do
indeed
see
that
something
more
is
necessary
for
the
golden
age
than
fixed
incomes
and
universal
stores
tickets
and
that
the
fountain
heads
of
all
real
improvement
are
to
be
found
in
human
temper
and
character
william
morris
for
instance
in
his
news
from
nowhere
gives
a
beautiful
picture
of
a
land
ruled
by
love
and
rightly
grounds
the
camaraderie
of
his
ideal
state
upon
an
assumed
improvement
in
human
nature
but
he
does
not
tell
us
how
such
an
improvement
is
to
be
effected
and
christ
did
of
christ
actual
method
in
this
matter
i
shall
speak
afterwards
when
dealing
with
the
practical
aspect
my
object
just
now
is
to
compare
the
spiritual
and
emotional
effects
of
the
call
of
christ
as
compared
to
those
of
the
vision
of
william
morris
when
we
compare
the
spiritual
attitudes
of
two
thinkers
one
of
whom
is
considering
whether
social
history
has
been
sufficiently
a
course
of
improvement
to
warrant
him
in
believing
that
it
will
culminate
in
universal
altruism
while
the
other
is
considering
whether
he
loves
other
people
enough
to
walk
down
tomorrow
to
the
and
distribute
everything
but
his
staff
and
his
scrip
it
will
not
be
denied
that
the
latter
is
likely
to
undergo
certain
deep
and
acute
emotional
experiences
which
will
be
quite
unknown
to
the
former
and
these
emotional
experiences
are
what
we
understand
as
the
spiritual
aspect
of
the
distinction
for
three
characteristics
at
least
the
galilean
programme
makes
more
provision
humility
activity
cheerfulness
the
real
triad
of
christian
virtues
humility
is
a
grand
a
stirring
thing
the
exalting
paradox
of
christianity
and
the
sad
want
of
it
in
our
own
time
is
we
believe
what
really
makes
us
think
life
dull
like
a
cynic
instead
of
marvellous
like
a
child
with
this
however
we
have
at
present
nothing
to
do
what
we
have
to
do
with
is
the
unfortunate
fact
that
among
no
persons
is
it
more
wanting
than
among
socialists
christian
and
other
the
isolated
or
scattered
protest
for
a
complete
change
in
social
order
the
continual
harping
on
one
string
the
necessarily
jaundiced
contemplation
of
a
system
already
condemned
and
above
all
the
haunting
pessimistic
whisper
of
a
possible
hopelessness
of
overcoming
the
giant
forces
of
success
all
these
impart
undeniably
to
the
modern
socialist
a
tone
excessively
imperious
and
bitter
nor
can
we
reasonably
blame
the
average
public
for
their
impatience
with
the
monotonous
virulence
of
men
who
are
constantly
reviling
them
for
not
living
communistically
and
who
after
all
are
not
doing
it
themselves
willingly
do
we
allow
that
these
latter
enthusiasts
think
it
impossible
in
the
present
state
of
society
to
practise
their
ideal
but
this
fact
while
vindicating
their
indisputable
sincerity
throws
an
unfortunate
vagueness
and
inconclusiveness
over
their
denunciations
of
other
people
in
the
same
position
let
us
compare
with
this
arrogant
and
angry
tone
among
the
modern
utopians
who
can
only
dream
the
life
the
tone
of
the
early
christian
who
was
busy
living
it
as
far
as
we
know
the
early
christians
never
regarded
it
as
astonishing
that
the
world
as
they
found
it
was
competitive
and
unregenerate
they
seem
to
have
felt
that
it
could
not
in
its
ignorance
have
been
anything
else
and
their
whole
interest
was
bent
on
their
own
standard
of
conduct
and
exhortation
which
was
necessary
to
convert
it
they
felt
that
it
was
by
no
merit
of
theirs
that
they
had
been
enabled
to
enter
into
the
life
before
the
romans
but
simply
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
christ
had
appeared
in
galilee
and
not
in
rome
lastly
they
never
seem
to
have
entertained
a
doubt
that
the
message
would
itself
convert
the
world
with
a
rapidity
and
ease
which
left
no
room
for
severe
condemnation
of
the
heathen
societies
with
regard
to
the
second
merit
that
of
activity
there
can
be
little
doubt
as
to
where
it
lies
between
the
planner
of
the
utopia
and
the
convert
of
the
brotherhood
the
modern
socialist
is
a
visionary
but
in
this
he
is
on
the
same
ground
as
half
the
great
men
of
the
world
and
to
some
extent
of
the
early
christian
himself
who
rushed
towards
a
personal
ideal
very
difficult
to
sustain
the
visionary
who
yearns
toward
an
ideal
which
is
practically
impossible
is
not
useless
or
mischievous
but
often
the
opposite
but
the
person
who
is
often
useless
and
always
mischievous
is
the
visionary
who
dreams
with
the
knowledge
or
the
that
his
ideal
is
impossible
the
early
christian
might
be
wrong
in
believing
that
by
entering
the
brotherhood
men
could
in
a
few
years
become
perfect
even
as
their
father
in
heaven
was
perfect
but
he
believed
it
and
acted
flatly
and
fearlessly
on
the
belief
this
is
the
type
of
the
higher
visionary
but
all
the
insidious
dangers
of
the
vision
the
idleness
the
procrastination
the
mere
mental
aestheticism
come
in
when
the
vision
is
indulged
as
half
our
socialistic
conceptions
are
as
a
mere
humour
or
with
a
consciousness
that
it
is
beyond
practical
politics
and
that
we
need
not
be
troubled
with
its
immediate
fulfilment
the
visionary
who
believes
in
his
own
most
frantic
vision
is
always
noble
and
useful
it
is
the
visionary
who
does
not
believe
in
his
vision
who
is
the
dreamer
the
idler
the
utopian
this
then
is
the
second
moral
virtue
of
the
older
school
an
immense
direct
sincerity
of
action
a
cleansing
away
by
the
sweats
of
hard
work
of
all
those
subtle
and
perilous
instincts
of
mere
ethical
which
have
been
woven
like
the
spells
of
an
enchantress
round
so
many
of
the
strong
men
of
our
own
time
the
third
merit
which
i
have
called
cheerfulness
is
really
the
most
important
of
all
we
may
perhaps
put
the
comparison
in
this
way
it
might
strike
many
persons
as
strange
that
in
a
time
on
the
whole
so
optimistic
in
its
intellectual
beliefs
as
this
is
in
an
age
when
only
a
small
minority
disbelieve
in
social
progress
and
a
large
majority
believe
in
an
ultimate
social
perfection
there
should
be
such
a
tired
and
blasé
feeling
among
numbers
of
young
men
this
we
think
is
due
not
to
the
want
of
an
ultimate
ideal
but
to
that
of
any
immediate
way
of
making
for
it
not
of
something
to
hope
but
of
something
to
do
a
human
being
is
not
satisfied
and
never
will
be
satisfied
with
being
told
that
it
is
all
right
what
he
wants
is
not
a
prediction
of
what
other
people
will
be
hundreds
of
years
hence
to
make
him
cheerful
but
a
new
and
stirring
test
and
task
for
himself
which
will
assuredly
make
him
cheerful
a
knight
is
not
contented
with
the
statement
that
his
commander
has
hid
his
plans
so
as
to
insure
victory
what
the
knight
wants
is
a
sword
this
demand
for
a
task
is
not
mere
bravado
it
is
an
eternal
and
natural
part
of
the
higher
optimism
as
as
the
foreshadowing
of
perfection
i
do
not
know
whether
gilbert
would
yet
have
actually
called
himself
a
christian
he
was
certainly
tending
towards
the
more
christian
elements
in
his
surroundings
it
seems
pretty
clear
from
all
he
wrote
and
said
later
that
he
did
not
hold
that
transformation
to
have
been
fully
effected
until
after
his
meeting
with
frances
to
whom
he
wrote
many
years
later
therefore
i
bring
these
rhymes
to
you
who
brought
the
cross
to
me
these
papers
are
undated
and
are
arranged
in
no
sequence
it
is
possible
this
last
one
was
written
after
their
first
meeting
certain
it
is
that
in
it
he
had
begun
feeling
after
a
more
christian
arrangement
of
society
than
socialism
offered
and
particularly
after
an
arrangement
better
suited
to
the
nature
of
man
this
thought
of
man
nature
as
primary
was
to
remain
the
basis
of
his
social
thinking
to
the
end
of
his
life

was
frances
daughter
of
a
diamond
merchant
some
time
dead
the
family
was
of
french
descent
the
name
de
blogue
having
been
somewhat
unfortunately
anglicised
into
blogg
they
had
fallen
from
considerable
wealth
into
a
degree
of
poverty
that
made
it
necessary
for
the
three
daughters
to
earn
a
living
frances
was
never
strong
and
gilbert
has
told
how
utterly
exhausted
she
was
at
the
end
of
each
day
toil
she
worked
very
hard
as
secretary
of
an
educational
society
in
london
the
family
lived
in
bedford
park
a
suburb
of
london
that
went
in
for
artistic
housing
and
a
kind
of
atmosphere
long
before
this
was
at
all
general
judging
by
their
photographs
the
three
girls
must
all
have
been
remarkably
pretty
and
young
men
frequented
the

great
numbers
among
them
brimley
johnson
who
was
engaged
to
gertrude
and
lucian
oldershaw
who
later
married
ethel
some
time
in

took
gilbert
to
call
and
gilbert
literally
at
first
sight
fell
in
love
with
frances

very
carefully
he
set
a
star
apart
for
it
he
stained

with
sunshine
he
peopled
it
with

book
filled
with
his
rough
sketches
for
you
when
almost
forty
years
later
gilbert
was
writing
his
frances
asked
him
to
keep
her
out
of
it
the
liking
they
both
had
for
keeping
private
life
private
made
him
call
it
this
very
victorian
narrative
nevertheless
he
tells
us
something
of
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
gilbert
had
mentioned
the
moon
she
told
me
in
the
most
normal
and
unpretentious
tone
that
she
hated
the
moon
i
talked
to
the
same
lady
several
times
afterwards
and
found
that
this
was
a
perfectly
honest
statement
of
the
fact
her
attitude
on
this
and
other
things
might
be
called
a
prejudice
but
it
could
not
possibly
be
called
a
fad
still
less
an
affectation
she
really
had
an
obstinate
objection
to
all
those
natural
forces
that
seemed
to
be
sterile
or
aimless
she
disliked
loud
winds
that
seemed
to
be
going
nowhere
she
did
not
care
much
for
the
sea
a
spectacle
of
which
i
was
very
fond
and
by
the
same
instinct
she
was
up
against
the
moon
which
she
said
looked
like
an
imbecile
on
the
other
hand
she
had
a
sort
of
hungry
appetite
for
all
the
fruitful
things
like
fields
and
gardens
and
anything
connected
with
production
about
which
she
was
quite
practical
she
practised
gardening
in
that
curious
cockney
culture
she
would
have
been
quite
ready
to
practise
farming
and
on
the
same
perverse
principle
she
actually
practised
a
religion
this
was
something
utterly
unaccountable
both
to
me
and
to
the
whole
fussy
culture
in
which
she
lived
any
number
of
people
proclaimed
religions
chiefly
oriental
religions
analysed
or
argued
about
them
but
that
anybody
could
regard
religion
as
a
practical
thing
like
gardening
was
something
quite
new
to
me
and
to
her
neighbours
new
and
incomprehensible
she
had
been
by
an
accident
brought
up
in
the
school
of
an
convent
and
to
all
that
agnostic
or
mystic
world
practising
a
religion
was
much
more
puzzling
than
professing
it
she
was
a
queer
card
she
wore
a
green
velvet
dress
barred
with
grey
fur
which
i
should
have
called
artistic
but
that
she
hated
all
the
talk
about
art
and
she
had
an
attractive
face
which
i
should
have
called
elvish
but
that
she
hated
all
the
talk
about
elves
but
what
was
arresting
and
almost
about
her
in
that
social
atmosphere
was
not
so
much
that
she
hated
it
as
that
she
was
entirely
unaffected
by
it
she
never
knew
what
was
meant
by
being
under
the
influence
of
yeats
or
shaw
or
tolstoy
or
anybody
else
she
was
intelligent
with
a
great
love
of
literature
and
especially
of
stevenson
but
if
stevenson
had
walked
into
the
room
and
explained
his
personal
doubts
about
personal
immortality
she
would
have
regretted
that
he
should
be
wrong
upon
the
point
but
would
otherwise
have
been
utterly
unaffected
she
was
not
at
all
like
robespierre
except
in
a
taste
for
neatness
in
dress
and
yet
it
is
only
in
belloc
book
on
robespierre
that
i
have
ever
found
any
words
that
describe
the
unique
quality
that
cut
her
off
from
the
current
culture
and
saved
her
from
it
god
had
given
him
in
his
mind
a
stone
tabernacle
in
which
certain
great
truths
were
preserved

that
question
to
them
there
would
be
a
scene
blogg
would
probably
fall
among
the
knollys
would
foam
in
convulsions
on
the
carpet
ethel
would
scream
and
take
refuge
on
the
mantelpiece
and
gertrude
faint
and
break
off
her
engagement
frances
would
but
no
intelligent
person
can
affect
an
interest
in
what
she
does
lawrence
solomon
told
me
that
edward
chesterton
did
not
approve
of
the
rather
atmosphere
of
bedford
park
that
earliest
of
garden
cities
so
conventionally
unconventional
where
frances
lived
she
did
not
like
her
son
friendship
with
the
bloggs
and
she
had
chosen
for
him
a
girl
who
she
felt
would
make
him
an
ideal
wife
very
open
air
solomon
said
not
booky
but
good
at
games
and
practical
he
was
not
sure
whether
gilbert
realised
this
but
personally
i
believe
that
gilbert
realised
everything
of
course
you
know
annie
firmin
wrote
to
me
that
aunt
marie
never
liked
frances
or
bentley
annie
was
the
girl
chosen
by
gilbert
mother
she
was
very
much
a
member
of
the
family
did
gilbert
ever
speak
to
you
she
wrote
to
me
recently
of
the
old
saturday
night
parties
at
barnes
at
the
home
of
the
grandparents
every
saturday
night
the
family
or
as
many
of
it
as
could
used
to
go
down
to
barnes
to
supper
and
the
and
tom
gilbert
alice
chesterton
husband
used
to
sing
round
the
supper
table
many
a
one
i
went
to
when
i
was
staying
at
warwick
gardens
we
used
to
go
on
a
red
hammersmith
bus
before
the
days
of
motor
cars
on
a
longer
trip
they
stayed
at
berck
in
belgium
and
cecil
had
a
strange
idea
apparently
regarded
by
him
as
humorous
which
measures
the
family
absence
of
a
christian
sense
at
this
date
cecil
urged
me
to
sit
at
the
foot
of
the
big
crucifix
in
the
village
street
and
let
him
photograph
me
as
mary
magdalen
i
and
i
do
know
how
he
thought
he
get
away
with
the
modern
clothing
whatever
gilbert
mother
may
have
planned
for
them
neither
she
nor
gilbert
had
any
romantic
feeling
for
each
other
indeed
cecil
was
definitely
her
favourite
and
she
believed
him
the
favourite
of
both
parents
also
he
had
more
heart
she
says
than
the
more
brilliant
gilbert
anyhow
his
heart
was
shown
more
openly
to
her
cecil
was
not
much
given
to
versifying
she
wrote
in
another
letter
he
sent
me
the
enclosed
when
my
son
was
born
i
value
it
so
much
headed
to
annie
the
poem
is
a
long
one
it
begins
with
the
ancient
comradeship
loyal
and
unbroken
in
which
they
had
first
seen
life
together
shining
nights
tumultuous
days
joy
swift
caught
in
sudden
ways
all
the
laughter
love
and
praise
all
the
joys
of
living
these
we
shared
together
dear
plot
and
jest
and
story
this
is
hid
shut
off
unknown
seeing
that
to
you
alone
is
the
wondrous
kingdom
shown
and
the
power
and
glory
annie
thoughts
then
and
cecil
were
not
greatly
on
the
elder
brother
who
was
pursuing
his
own
romance
with
a
heart
that
seems
to
have
been
fairly
adequate
in
its
energies
most
mothers
have
watched
their
sons
through
one
or
more
experiences
of
calf
love
gilbert
indicates
in
the
and
i
knew
it
too
from
some
jokes
he
and
frances
used
to
make
that
he
had
had
one
or
two
fancies
before
the
coming
of
reality
he
must
then
convince
his
mother
that
reality
had
come
he
must
overcome
a
prejudice
avowed
by
neither
he
must
call
on
the
deeps
of
a
feelings
so
effectively
that
it
would
never
now
be
avowed
that
it
might
indeed
be
swept
away
and
so
sitting
at
a
table
in
a
seaside
lodging
as
his
mother
sat
in
the
same
room
or
moved
about
making
cocoa
for
the
family
gilbert
tried
to
express
what
even
for
him
was
the
inexpressible
rosebery
villas
granville
road
felixstowe
my
dearest
mother
you
may
possibly
think
this
a
somewhat
eccentric
proceeding
you
are
sitting
opposite
and
talking
about
berline
but
i
take
this
method
of
addressing
you
because
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
might
possibly
wish
to
turn
the
matter
over
in
your
mind
before
writing
or
speaking
to
me
about
it
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
whole
of
a
situation
in
which
i
believe
i
have
acted
rightly
though
i
am
not
absolutely
certain
and
to
ask
for
your
advice
on
it
it
was
a
somewhat
complicated
one
and
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
think
i
could
rightly
have
acted
otherwise
but
if
i
were
the
greatest
fool
in
the
three
kingdoms
and
had
made
nothing
but
a
mess
of
it
there
is
one
person
i
should
always
turn
to
and
trust
mothers
know
more
of
their
son
idiocies
than
other
people
can
and
this
has
been
peculiarly
true
in
your
case
i
have
always
rejoiced
at
this
and
not
been
ashamed
of
it
this
has
always
been
true
and
always
will
be
these
things
are
easier
written
than
said
but
you
know
it
is
true
do
you
i
am
inexpressibly
anxious
that
you
should
give
me
credit
for
having
done
my
best
and
for
having
constantly
had
in
mind
the
way
in
which
you
would
be
affected
by
the
letter
i
am
now
writing
i
do
hope
you
will
be
pleased
almost
eight
years
ago
you
made
a
remark
this
may
show
you
that
if
we
jeer
at
your
remarks
we
remember
them
the
remark
applied
to
the
hypothetical
young
lady
with
whom
i
should
fall
in
love
and
took
the
form
of
saying
if
she
is
good
i
sha
mind
who
she
is
i
do
know
how
many
times
i
have
said
that
over
to
myself
in
the
last
two
or
three
days
in
which
i
have
decided
on
this
letter
do
not
be
frightened
or
suppose
that
anything
sensational
or
final
has
occurred
i
am
not
married
my
dear
mother
neither
am
i
engaged
you
are
called
to
the
council
of
chiefs
very
early
in
its
deliberations
if
you
do
mind
i
will
tell
you
briefly
the
whole
story
you
are
i
think
the
shrewdest
person
for
seeing
things
whom
i
ever
knew
consequently
i
imagine
that
you
do
not
think
that
i
go
down
to
bedford
park
every
sunday
for
the
sake
of
the
scenery
i
should
not
wonder
if
you
know
nearly
as
much
about
the
matter
as
i
can
tell
in
a
letter
suffice
it
to
say
however
briefly
for
neither
of
us
care
much
for
gushing
this
letter
is
not
on
ratcliffe
lines
that
the
first
half
of
my
time
of
acquaintance
with
the
bloggs
was
spent
in
enjoying
a
very
intimate
but
quite
breezy
and
platonic
friendship
with
frances
blogg
reading
talking
and
enjoying
life
together
having
great
sympathies
on
all
subjects
and
the
second
half
in
making
the
thrilling
but
painfully
responsible
discovery
that
platonism
on
my
side
had
not
the
field
by
any
means
to
itself
that
is
how
we
stand
now
no
one
knows
except
her
family
and
yourself
my
dearest
mother
i
am
sure
you
are
at
least
not
unsympathetic
indeed
we
love
each
other
more
than
we
shall
either
of
us
ever
be
able
to
say
i
have
refrained
from
sentiment
in
this
letter
for
i
do
think
you
like
it
much
but
love
is
a
very
different
thing
from
sentiment
and
you
will
never
laugh
at
that
i
will
not
say
that
you
are
sure
to
like
frances
for
all
young
men
say
that
to
their
mothers
quite
naturally
and
their
mothers
never
believe
them
also
quite
naturally
besides
i
am
so
confident
i
should
like
you
to
find
her
out
for
yourself
she
is
in
reality
very
much
the
sort
of
woman
you
like
what
is
called
i
believe
a
woman
woman
very
humorous
inconsequent
and
sympathetic
and
defiled
with
no
offensive
exuberance
of
good
health
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
except
that
you
and
she
have
occupied
my
mind
for
the
last
week
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
which
must
account
for
my
abstraction
and
that
in
her
letter
she
sent
the
following
message
please
tell
your
mother
soon
tell
her
i
am
not
so
silly
as
to
expect
her
to
think
me
good
enough
but
really
i
will
try
to
be
an
aspiration
which
considered
from
my
point
of
view
naturally
provokes
a
smile
here
you
give
me
a
cup
of
cocoa
thank
you
believe
me
my
dearest
mother
always
your
very
affectionate
son
gilbert
what
exactly
gilbert
meant
by
saying
they
were
not
engaged
it
is
hard
to
surmise
in
view
of
frances
message
to
her
future
of
his
sensations
when
proposing
gilbert
gives
some
idea
in
the
it
was
fortunate
however
that
our
next
most
important
meeting
was
not
under
the
sign
of
the
moon
but
of
the
sun
she
has
often
affirmed
during
our
later
acquaintance
that
if
the
sun
had
not
been
shining
to
her
complete
satisfaction
on
that
day
the
issue
might
have
been
quite
different
it
happened
in
james
park
where
they
keep
the
ducks
and
the
little
bridge
which
has
been
mentioned
in
no
less
authoritative
a
work
than
belloc
essay
on
bridges
since
i
find
myself
quoting
that
author
once
more
i
think
he
deals
in
some
detail
in
his
best
topographical
manner
with
various
historic
sites
on
the
continent
but
later
relapses
into
a
larger
manner
somewhat
thus
the
time
has
now
come
to
talk
at
large
about
bridges
the
longest
bridge
in
the
world
is
the
forth
bridge
and
the
shortest
bridge
in
the
world
is
a
plank
over
a
ditch
in
the
village
of
loudwater
the
bridge
that
frightens
you
most
is
the
brooklyn
bridge
and
the
bridge
that
frightens
you
least
is
the
bridge
in
james
park
i
admit
that
i
crossed
that
bridge
in
undeserved
safety
and
perhaps
i
was
affected
by
my
early
romantic
vision
of
the
bridge
leading
to
the
princess
tower
but
i
can
assure
my
friend
the
author
that
the
bridge
in
james
park
can
frighten
you
a
good
deal
pp
now
with
frances
promised
to
him
gilbert
could
enjoy
everything
properly
could
execute
verbally
at
least
a
wild
fantasia
among
the
first
of
his
friends
to
be
written
to
was
mildred
wain
because
as
he
says
in
a
later
letter
he
felt
towards
her
deep
gratitude
for
forming
a
topic
of
conversation
on
my
first
visit
to
a
family
with
which
i
have
since
formed
a
dark
and
shameful
connection
dear
mildred
on
rising
this
morning
i
carefully
washed
my
boots
in
hot
water
and
blacked
my
face
then
assuming
my
coat
with
graceful
ease
and
with
the
tails
in
front
i
descended
to
breakfast
where
i
gaily
poured
the
coffee
on
the
sardines
and
put
my
hat
on
the
fire
to
boil
these
activities
will
give
you
some
idea
of
my
frame
of
mind
my
family
observing
me
leave
the
house
by
way
of
the
chimney
and
take
the
fender
with
me
under
one
arm
thought
i
must
have
something
on
my
mind
so
i
had
my
friend
i
am
engaged
i
am
only
telling
it
at
present
to
my
real
friends
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
the
next
question
that
arises
is
whom
am
i
engaged
to
i
have
investigated
this
problem
with
some
care
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
best
authorities
point
to
frances
blogg
there
can
i
think
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
she
is
the
lady
it
is
as
well
to
have
these
minor
matters
clear
in
one
mind
i
am
very
much
too
happy
to
write
much
but
i
thought
you
might
remember
my
existence
sufficiently
to
be
interested
in
the
incident
waldo
has
been
of
so
much
help
to
me
in
this
and
in
everything
and
i
am
so
much
interested
in
you
for
his
sake
and
your
own
that
i
am
encouraged
to
hope
our
friendship
may
subsist
if
ever
i
have
done
anything
rude
or
silly
it
was
quite
inadvertent
i
have
always
wished
to
please
you
to
annie
firmin
he
wrote
i
can
only
think
of
the
day
one
of
the
earliest
i
can
recall
of
my
life
when
you
came
in
and
helped
me
to
build
a
house
with
bricks
i
am
building
another
one
now
and
it
would
not
have
been
complete
without
your
going
over
it
to
others
he
wrote
such
sentences
as
he
could
put
together
in
the
whirlwind
of
his
happiness
for
himself
he
stammered
in
a
verse
that
grew
with
the
years
into
his
great
love
poetry
god
made
thee
mightily
my
love
he
stretched
his
hands
out
of
his
rest
and
lit
the
star
of
east
and
west
brooding
darkness
like
a
dove
god
made
thee
mightily
my
love
god
made
thee
patiently
my
sweet
out
of
all
stars
he
chose
a
star
he
made
it
red
with
sunset
bar
and
green
with
greeting
for
thy
feet
god
made
thee
mightily
my
sweet
chapter
viii
to
frances
this
chapter
can
be
written
only
by
gilbert
himself
it
might
seem
that
he
had
no
words
left
for
an
emotion
heightened
beyond
the
love
of
his
friends
and
the
joyous
acceptance
of
existence
but
in
these
letters
he
shows
the
truth
of
his
own
theory
that
to
love
each
thing
separately
strengthens
the
power
of
loving
to
have
tried
to
love
everyone
is
as
he
tells
frances
no
bad
preparation
for
loving
her
the
emotion
of
falling
in
love
had
both
intensified
his
appreciation
of
all
things
and
cast
for
him
a
vivid
light
on
past
present
and
future
so
that
in
the
last
of
these
letters
he
sketches
his
life
down
to
the
moment
when
a
new
life
begins
i
am
looking
over
the
sea
and
endeavouring
to
reckon
up
the
estate
i
have
to
offer
you
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
my
equipment
for
starting
on
a
journey
to
fairyland
consists
of
the
following
items
a
straw
hat
the
oldest
part
of
this
admirable
relic
shows
traces
of
pure
norman
work
the
vandalism
of
cromwell
soldiers
has
left
us
little
of
the
original
a
walking
stick
very
knobby
and
heavy
admirably
fitted
to
break
the
head
of
any
denizen
of
suffolk
who
denies
that
you
are
the
noblest
of
ladies
but
of
no
other
manifest
use
a
copy
of
walt
whitman
poems
once
nearly
given
to
salter
but
quite
forgotten
it
has
his
name
in
it
still
with
an
affectionate
inscription
from
his
sincere
friend
gilbert
chesterton
i
wonder
if
he
will
ever
have
it
a
number
of
letters
from
a
young
lady
containing
everything
good
and
generous
and
loyal
and
holy
and
wise
that
is
in
walt
whitman
poems
an
unwieldy
sort
of
a
pocket
knife
the
blades
mostly
having
an
edge
of
a
more
varied
and
picturesque
outline
than
is
provided
by
the
prosaic
cutter
the
chief
element
however
is
a
thing
take
stones
out
of
a
horse
hoof
what
a
beautiful
sensation
of
security
it
gives
one
to
reflect
that
if
one
should
ever
have
money
enough
to
buy
a
horse
and
should
happen
to
buy
one
and
the
horse
should
happen
to
have
a
stone
in
his
hoof
that
one
is
ready
one
stands
prepared
with
a
defiant
smile
passing
from
the
last
miracle
of
practical
foresight
we
come
to
a
box
of
matches
every
now
and
then
i
strike
one
of
these
because
fire
is
beautiful
and
burns
your
fingers
some
people
think
this
waste
of
matches
the
same
people
who
object
to
the
building
of
cathedrals
about
three
pounds
in
gold
and
silver
the
remains
of
one
of
unwin
bursts
of
affection
those
explosions
of
spontaneous
love
for
myself
which
such
is
the
perfect
order
and
harmony
of
his
mind
occur
at
startlingly
exact
intervals
of
time
a
book
of
children
rhymes
in
manuscript
called
the
book
about
finished
and
destined
for
mr
nutt
i
have
been
working
at
it
fairly
steadily
which
i
think
jolly
creditable
under
the
circumstances
one
ca
put
anything
interesting
in
it
understand
those
things
when
they
grow
up
at
a
tennis
racket
nay
start
not
it
is
a
part
of
the
new
régime
and
the
only
new
and
thing
in
the
museum
soon
mellow
it
like
the
straw
hat
my
brother
and
i
are
teaching
each
other
lawn
tennis
a
soul
hitherto
idle
and
omnivorous
but
now
happy
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
itself
a
body
equally
idle
and
quite
equally
omnivorous
absorbing
tea
coffee
claret
and
oxygen
to
its
own
perfect
satisfaction
it
is
happiest
swimming
i
think
the
sea
being
about
a
convenient
size
a
heart
mislaid
somewhere
and
that
is
about
all
the
property
of
which
an
inventory
can
be
made
at
present
after
all
my
tastes
are
stoically
simple
a
straw
hat
a
stick
a
box
of
matches
and
some
of
his
own
poetry
what
more
does
man
require
the
city
of
felixstowe
as
seen
by
the
local
prophet
from
the
neighbouring
does
not
strike
the
eye
as
having
anything
uncanny
about
it
at
least
i
imagine
that
it
requires
rather
careful
scrutiny
before
the
eerie
curl
of
a
chimney
pot
or
the
elfin
wink
of
a
lonely
brings
home
to
the
startled
soul
that
it
is
really
the
city
of
a
fearful
folk
that
the
inhabitants
are
not
human
in
the
ordinary
sense
is
quite
clear
yet
it
has
only
just
begun
to
dawn
on
me
after
staying
a
week
in
the
town
of
unreason
with
its
monstrous
landscape
and
grave
unmeaning
customs
do
i
seem
to
be
raving
let
me
give
my
experiences
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
i
do
not
think
i
am
good
at
shopping
i
generally
succeed
in
getting
rid
of
money
but
other
observances
such
as
bringing
away
the
goods
that
i
paid
for
and
knowing
what
i
bought
i
often
pass
over
as
secondary
but
to
shop
in
a
town
of
ordinary
tradesmen
is
one
thing
to
shop
in
a
town
of
raving
lunatics
is
another
i
set
out
one
morning
happy
and
hopeful
with
the
intention
of
buying
a
a
tennis
racket
b
some
tennis
balls
c
some
tennis
shoes
d
a
ticket
for
a
tennis
ground
i
went
to
the
shop
pointed
out
by
some
villager
probably
mad
and
went
in
and
said
i
believed
they
kept
tennis
rackets
the
young
man
smiled
and
assented
i
suggested
that
he
might
show
me
some
the
young
man
looked
positively
alarmed
he
said
have
got
any
not
got
any
here
i
asked
they
out
you
know
all
round
he
explained
wildly
with
a
graphic
gesture
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
and
the
sky
out
round
we
left
them
all
round
at
places
to
this
day
i
do
know
what
he
meant
but
i
merely
asked
when
they
would
quit
these
weird
retreats
he
said
in
an
hour
in
an
hour
i
called
again
were
they
in
now
not
in
not
in
just
yet
he
said
with
a
sort
of
feverish
confidentialness
as
if
he
was
quite
well
they
still
all
out
at
places
i
asked
with
restrained
humour
no
he
said
with
a
burst
of
reassuring
pride
are
only
out
there
out
behind
you
know
i
hope
my
face
expressed
my
beaming
comprehension
of
the
spot
alluded
to
eventually
at
a
third
visit
the
rackets
were
produced
none
of
them
i
was
told
by
my
brother
were
of
any
maker
so
that
was
outside
the
question
the
choice
was
between
some
good
neat
instruments
which
suited
me
and
some
objects
with
plain
deal
handles
which
would
have
done
at
a
pinch
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
get
a
racket
in
london
and
content
myself
for
the
present
with
economising
on
one
of
these
monuments
of
depression
so
i
asked
the
price
was
the
price
of
the
article
i
thought
this
large
for
the
tool
and
wondered
if
the
rackets
were
much
dearer
what
price
the
said
the
creature
cheery
as
a
bird
i
did
not
faint
i
am
strong
i
rejected
the
article
which
was
dearer
because
it
had
been
hallowed
by
human
possession
and
accepted
the
cheap
new
crude
racket
except
the
newness
there
was
no
difference
between
them
whatever
i
then
asked
the
smiling
maniac
for
balls
he
brought
me
a
selection
of
large
red
globes
nearly
as
big
as
dutch
cheeses
i
said
these
he
said
did
you
want
i
said
yes
they
often
came
in
handy
at
tennis
the
goblin
was
however
quite
impervious
to
satire
and
i
left
him
endeavouring
to
draw
my
attention
to
his
wares
in
general
particularly
to
some
zinc
baths
which
he
seemed
to
think
should
form
part
of
the
equipment
of
a
never
before
or
since
have
i
met
a
being
of
that
order
and
degree
of
creepiness
he
was
a
nightmare
of
unmeaning
idiocy
but
some
mention
ought
to
be
made
of
the
old
man
at
the
entrance
to
the
tennis
ground
who
opened
his
mouth
in
parables
on
the
subject
of
the
fee
for
playing
there
he
seemed
to
have
been
wound
up
to
make
only
one
remark
sixpence
under
these
circumstances
the
attempt
to
discover
whether
the
sixpence
covered
a
day
tennis
or
a
week
or
fifty
years
was
rather
baffling
at
last
i
put
down
the
sixpence
this
seemed
to
galvanise
him
into
life
he
looked
at
the
clock
which
was
indicating
five
past
eleven
and
said
sixpence
an
hour
so
you
be
all
right
till
two
i
fled
screaming
since
then
i
have
examined
the
town
more
carefully
and
feel
the
presence
of
something
nameless
there
is
a
in
the
trees
an
in
the
dark
flints
in
the
wall
that
is
not
of
this
world
when
we
set
up
a
house
darling
honeysuckle
porch
yew
clipt
hedge
bees
poetry
and
eight
shillings
a
week
i
think
you
will
have
to
do
the
shopping
particularly
at
felixstowe
there
was
a
great
and
glorious
man
who
said
us
the
luxuries
of
life
and
we
will
dispense
with
the
necessities
that
i
think
would
be
a
splendid
motto
to
write
in
letters
of
brown
gold
over
the
porch
of
our
hypothetical
home
there
will
be
a
sofa
for
you
for
example
but
no
chairs
for
i
prefer
the
floor
there
will
be
a
select
store
of
to
make
you
do
the
carp
with
and
the
rest
will
be
bread
and
water
we
will
each
retain
a
suit
of
evening
dress
for
great
occasions
and
at
other
times
clothe
ourselves
in
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
how
pretty
you
would
look
which
would
fit
your
taste
in
furs
and
be
economical
i
have
sometimes
thought
it
would
be
very
fine
to
take
an
ordinary
house
a
very
poor
commonplace
house
in
west
kensington
say
and
make
it
symbolic
not
artistic
heaven
o
heaven
forbid
my
blood
boils
when
i
think
of
the
affronts
put
by
pictorial
epicures
on
the
strong
honest
ugly
patient
shapes
of
necessary
things
the
brave
old
bones
of
life
there
are
aesthetic
pottering
prigs
who
can
look
on
a
saucepan
without
one
tear
of
joy
or
sadness
mongrel
decadents
that
can
see
no
dignity
in
the
honourable
scars
of
a
kettle
so
they
concentrate
all
their
house
decoration
on
coloured
windows
that
nobody
looks
out
of
and
vases
of
lilies
that
everybody
wishes
out
of
the
way
no
my
idea
which
is
much
cheaper
is
to
make
a
house
really
allegoric
really
explain
its
own
essential
meaning
mystical
or
ancient
sayings
should
be
inscribed
on
every
object
the
more
prosaic
the
object
the
better
and
the
more
coarsely
and
rudely
the
inscription
was
traced
the
better
thou
sent
the
rain
upon
the
earth
should
be
inscribed
on
the
perhaps
on
the
umbrella
the
hairs
of
your
head
are
all
numbered
would
give
a
tremendous
significance
to
one
hairbrushes
the
words
about
water
would
reveal
the
music
and
sanctity
of
the
sink
while
god
is
a
consuming
fire
might
be
written
over
the
to
assist
the
mystic
musings
of
the
cook
shall
we
ever
try
that
experiment
dearest
perhaps
not
for
no
words
would
be
golden
enough
for
the
tools
you
had
to
touch
you
would
be
beauty
enough
for
one
house
by
all
means
let
us
have
bad
things
in
our
dwelling
and
make
them
good
things
i
shall
offer
no
objection
to
your
having
an
occasional
dragon
to
dinner
or
a
penitent
griffin
to
sleep
in
the
spare
bed
the
image
of
you
taking
a
sunday
school
of
little
devils
is
pleasing
they
will
look
up
first
in
savage
wonder
then
in
vague
respect
they
will
see
the
most
glorious
and
noble
lady
that
ever
lived
since
their
prince
tempted
eve
with
a
halo
of
hair
and
great
heavenly
eyes
that
seem
to
make
the
good
at
the
heart
of
things
almost
too
terribly
simple
and
naked
for
the
sons
of
flesh
and
as
they
gaze
their
tails
will
drop
off
and
their
wings
will
sprout
and
they
will
become
angels
in
six
lessons
i
can
not
profess
to
offer
any
elaborate
explanation
of
your
disquiet
but
i
admit
it
does
not
wholly
surprise
me
you
see
i
happen
to
know
one
factor
in
the
case
and
one
only
of
which
you
are
wholly
ignorant
i
know
you
i
know
one
thing
which
has
made
me
feel
strange
before
your
mother
i
know
the
value
of
what
i
take
away
i
feel
in
a
weird
moment
like
the
angel
of
death
you
say
you
want
to
talk
to
me
about
death
my
views
about
death
are
bright
brisk
and
entertaining
when
azrael
takes
a
soul
it
may
be
to
other
and
brighter
worlds
like
those
whither
you
and
i
go
together
the
transformation
called
death
may
be
something
as
beautiful
and
dazzling
as
the
transformation
called
love
it
may
make
the
dead
man
just
as
your
mother
knows
that
you
are
happy
but
none
the
less
it
is
a
transformation
and
sad
sometimes
for
those
left
behind
a
mother
whose
child
is
dying
can
hardly
believe
that
in
the
inscrutable
unknown
there
is
anyone
who
can
look
to
it
as
well
as
she
and
if
a
mother
can
not
trust
her
child
easily
to
god
almighty
shall
i
be
so
mean
as
to
be
angry
because
she
can
not
trust
it
easily
to
me
i
tell
you
i
have
stood
before
your
mother
and
felt
like
a
thief
i
know
you
are
not
going
to
part
neither
physically
mentally
morally
nor
spiritually
but
she
sees
a
new
element
in
your
life
wholly
from
outside
is
it
not
natural
given
her
temperament
that
you
should
find
her
perturbed
oh
dearest
dearest
frances
let
us
always
be
very
gentle
to
older
people
indeed
darling
it
is
not
they
who
are
the
tyrants
but
we
they
may
interrupt
our
building
in
the
scaffolding
stages
we
turn
their
house
upside
down
when
it
is
their
final
home
and
rest
your
mother
would
certainly
have
worried
if
you
had
been
engaged
to
the
archangel
michael
who
indeed
is
bearing
his
disappointment
very
well
how
much
more
when
you
are
engaged
to
an
aimless
tactless
reckless
unbrushed
opinionated
scarecrow
who
has
suddenly
walked
into
the
vacant
place
i
could
have
prophesied
her
unrest
wait
and
she
will
calm
down
all
right
dear
god
comfort
her
i
dare
not
gilbert
keith
chesterton
was
born
of
comfortable
but
honest
parents
on
the
top
of
campden
hill
kensington
he
was
christened
at
george
church
which
stands
just
under
that
more
imposing
building
the
waterworks
tower
this
place
was
chosen
apparently
in
order
that
the
whole
available
water
supply
might
be
used
in
the
intrepid
attempt
to
make
him
a
member
of
christ
a
child
of
god
and
an
inheritor
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
the
early
years
of
this
remarkable
man
few
traces
remain
one
of
his
earliest
recorded
observations
was
the
simple
exclamation
full
of
delight
at
baby
funny
baby
here
we
see
the
first
hint
of
that
ineffable
conversational
modesty
that
shy
social
which
has
ever
hidden
his
light
under
a
bushel
his
mother
also
recounts
with
apparent
amusement
an
incident
connected
with
his
imperious
demand
for
his
father
me
that
hat
please
dear
you
must
have
that
me
that
hat
dear
you
do
give
it
me
i
say
an
exquisite
selection
in
the
matter
of
hats
has
indeed
always
been
one
of
the
great
man
hobbies
when
he
had
drawn
pictures
on
all
the
blinds
and
tablecloths
and
towels
and
walls
and
windowpanes
it
was
felt
that
he
required
a
larger
sphere
consequently
he
was
sent
to
bewsher
who
gave
him
desks
and
and
latin
grammars
and
atlases
to
draw
pictures
on
he
was
far
too
innately
conscientious
not
to
use
these
materials
to
draw
on
to
other
uses
asserted
by
some
to
belong
to
these
objects
he
paid
little
heed
the
only
really
curious
thing
about
his
school
life
was
that
he
had
a
weird
and
quite
involuntary
habit
of
getting
french
prizes
they
were
the
only
ones
he
ever
got
and
he
never
tried
to
get
them
but
though
the
thing
was
quite
mysterious
to
him
and
though
he
made
every
effort
to
avoid
it
it
went
on
being
evidently
a
part
of
some
occult
natural
law
for
the
first
half
of
his
time
at
school
he
was
very
solitary
and
futile
he
never
regretted
the
time
for
it
gave
him
two
things
complete
mental
and
a
comprehension
of
the
psychology
of
outcasts
but
one
day
as
he
was
roaming
about
a
great
naked
building
land
which
he
haunted
in
play
hours
rather
like
an
outlaw
in
the
woods
he
met
a
curious
agile
youth
with
hair
brushed
up
off
his
head
seeing
each
other
they
promptly
hit
each
other
simultaneously
and
had
a
fight
next
day
they
met
again
and
fought
again
these
homeric
conflicts
went
on
for
many
days
till
one
morning
in
the
crisis
of
some
insane
grapple
the
subject
of
this
biography
quoted
like
a
something
out
of
macaulay
the
other
started
and
relaxed
his
hold
they
gazed
at
each
other
then
the
foe
quoted
the
following
line
in
this
land
of
savages
they
knew
each
other
for
the
next
two
hours
they
talked
books
they
have
talked
books
ever
since
the
boy
was
edmund
clerihew
bentley
the
incident
just
narrated
is
the
true
and
real
account
of
the
first
and
deepest
of
our
hero
male
connections
but
another
was
to
ensue
probably
equally
profound
and
far
more
pregnant
with
awful
and
dazzling
consequences
bentley
always
had
a
habit
of
trying
to
do
things
well
twelve
years
of
the
other
friendship
has
not
cured
him
of
this
being
seized
with
a
peculiar
desire
to
learn
conjuring
he
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
eerie
and
supernatural
young
man
who
instructed
him
in
the
black
art
a
gaunt
mephistophelian
sort
of
individual
who
our
subject
half
thought
was
a
changeling
our
subject
has
not
quite
got
over
the
idea
yet
though
for
practical
social
purposes
he
calls
him
lucian
oldershaw
our
subject
met
lucian
oldershaw
night
as
shakespeare
says
was
a
star
these
three
persons
soon
became
known
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
paul
school
as
the
founders
of
a
singular
brotherhood
it
was
called
the
no
one
we
believe
could
ever
have
had
better
friends
than
did
the
hero
of
this
narrative
we
wish
that
we
could
bring
before
the
reader
the
personality
of
all
the
knights
of
that
eccentric
round
table
most
of
them
are
known
already
to
the
reader
even
the
subject
himself
is
possibly
known
to
the
reader
bertram
who
seemed
somehow
to
have
been
painted
by
vandyck
a
sombre
and
stately
young
man
a
blend
of
cavalier
and
puritan
with
the
physique
of
a
military
father
and
the
views
of
an
ethical
mother
and
a
soul
of
his
own
which
for
sheer
simplicity
is
something
staggering

with
an
oriental
and
inscrutable
placidity

and
then

dazzling
agility
and
meredithian
humour

who
masks
with
complete
fashionable
triviality
a
hebraic
immutability
of
passion
tried
in
a
more
ironical
and
bitter
service
than
his
father
jacob

with

extraordinary
in

these
were

may
he
be
forgiven
for
speaking
of
them
at
length
and
with
pride
some
day
we
hope
the
reader
may
know
them
all
he
knew
these
people
he
knew
their
friends
he
heard
mildred
wain
say
and
he
thought
it
was
a
funny
name
had
he
been
told
that
he
would
ever
pronounce
it
with
the
accents
of
tears
and
passion
he
would
have
said
in
his
pride
that
the
name
was
not
suitable
for
that
purpose
but
there
are
eph
greek
characters
in
original
he
went
for
a
time
to
an
art
school
there
he
met
a
great
many
curious
people
many
of
the
men
were
horrible
blackguards
he
was
not
exactly
that
so
they
naturally
found
each
other
interesting
he
went
through
some
rather
appalling
discoveries
about
human
life
and
the
final
discovery
was
that
there
is
no
devil
no
not
even
such
a
thing
as
a
bad
man
one
pleasant
saturday
afternoon
lucian
said
to
him
am
going
to
take
you
to
see
the
bloggs
what
said
the
unhappy
man
bloggs
said
the
other
darkly
naturally
assuming
that
it
was
the
name
of
a
he
reluctantly
followed
his
friend
he
came
to
a
small
if
it
was
a
it
was
not
a
businesslike
one
they
raised
the
latch
they
rang
the
bell
if
the
bell
was
not
in
the
close
time
just
then
no
flower
in
the
pots
winked
no
brick
grinned
no
sign
in
heaven
or
earth
warned
him
the
birds
sang
on
in
the
trees
he
went
in
the
first
time
he
spent
an
evening
at
the
bloggs
there
was
no
one
there
that
is
to
say
there
was
a
worn
but
fiery
little
lady
in
a
grey
dress
who
did
approve
of
solutions
of
social
problems
that
he
understood
was
blogg
there
was
a
long
blonde
smiling
young
person
who
seemed
to
think
him
quite
off
his
head
and
who
was
addressed
as
ethel
there
were
two
people
whose
meaning
and
status
he
could
imagine
one
of
whom
had
a
big
nose
and
the
other
had
lastly
there
was
a
creature
in
a
tremendous
hat
who
eyed
him
all
the
time
half
wildly
like
a
shying
horse
because
he
said
he
was
quite
happy
but
the
second
time
he
went
there
he
was
plumped
down
on
a
sofa
beside
a
being
of
whom
he
had
a
vague
impression
that
brown
hair
grew
at
intervals
all
down
her
like
a
caterpillar
once
in
the
course
of
conversation
she
looked
straight
at
him
and
he
said
to
himself
as
plainly
as
if
he
had
read
it
in
a
book
i
had
anything
to
do
with
this
girl
i
should
go
on
my
knees
to
her
if
i
spoke
with
her
she
would
never
deceive
me
if
i
depended
on
her
she
would
never
deny
me
if
i
loved
her
she
would
never
play
with
me
if
i
trusted
her
she
would
never
go
back
on
me
if
i
remembered
her
she
would
never
forget
me
i
may
never
see
her
again
goodbye
it
was
all
said
in
a
flash
but
it
was
all
said
two
years
as
they
say
in
the
playbills
is
supposed
to
elapse
and
here
is
the
subject
of
this
memoir
sitting
on
a
balcony
above
the
sea
the
time
evening
he
is
thinking
of
the
whole
bewildering
record
of
which
the
foregoing
is
a
brief
outline
he
sees
how
far
he
has
gone
wrong
and
how
idle
and
wasteful
and
wicked
he
has
often
been
how
miserably
unfitted
he
is
for
what
he
is
called
upon
to
be
let
him
now
declare
it
and
hereafter
for
ever
hold
his
peace
but
there
are
four
lamps
of
thanksgiving
always
before
him
the
first
is
for
his
creation
out
of
the
same
earth
with
such
a
woman
as
you
the
second
is
that
he
has
not
with
all
his
faults
after
strange
women
you
can
not
think
how
a
man
is
rewarded
in
this
the
third
is
that
he
has
tried
to
love
everything
alive
a
dim
preparation
for
loving
you
and
the
fourth
is
but
no
words
can
express
that
here
ends
my
previous
existence
take
it
it
led
me
to
you
chapter
ix
a
long
engagement
gilbert
sympathized
with
his
future
anxiety
at
frances
engagement
to
a
scarecrow
but
i
doubt
if
it
at
all
quickly
occurred
to
him
that
the
basis
of
that
anxiety
was
the
fact
that
he
was
earning
only
shillings
a
week
frances
herself
lucian
oldershaw
and
the
rest
of
his
friends
believed
he
was
a
genius
with
a
great
future
and
this
belief
they
tried
to
communicate
to
frances
family
but
even
if
they
succeeded
faith
in
the
future
did
not
pay
dividends
in
a
present
income
on
which
to
set
up
house
a
widow
considering
her
daughter
future
might
well
feel
a
little
anxiety
but
one
can
see
wheels
within
wheels
of
family
conclaves
and
matters
to
perplex
the
simple
which
drew
another
letter
from
gilbert
to
frances
it
is
a
mystic
and
refreshing
thought
that
i
shall
never
understand
bloggs
that
is
the
truth
of
it
that
this
remarkable
family
atmosphere
this
temperament
with
its
changing
moods
and
its
everlasting
will
its
divine
trust
in
one
soul
and
its
tremulous
speculations
as
to
one
future
its
sensitiveness
like
a
tempered
sword
vibrating
but
never
broken
its
patience
that
can
wait
for
eternity
and
its
impatience
that
can
not
wait
for
tea
its
power
of
bearing
huge
calamities
and
its
queer
little
moods
that
even
those
calamities
can
never
overshadow
or
wipe
out
its
brusqueness
that
always
pleases
and
its
that
sometimes
wounds
its
terrific
intensity
of
feeling
that
sometimes
paralyses
the
outsider
with
conversational
responsibility
its
untranslatable
humour
of
courage
and
poverty
and
its
unfathomed
epics
of
past
tragedy
and
triumph
all
this
glorious
confusion
of
family
traits
which
in
no
exaggerative
sense
make
the
gentiles
come
to
your
light
and
the
folk
of
the
nations
to
the
brightness
of
your
house
is
a
thing
so
utterly
outside
my
own
temperament
that
i
was
formed
by
nature
to
admire
and
not
understand
it
god
made
me
very
simply
as
he
made
a
tree
or
a
pig
or
an
oyster
to
perform
certain
functions
the
best
thing
he
gave
me
was
a
perfect
and
unshakable
trust
in
those
i
love
gilbert
sympathy
with
his
future
may
have
been
put
to
some
slight
strain
by
an
incident
related
by
lucian
oldershaw
blogg
begged
him
to
talk
to
gilbert
about
his
personal
appearance
clothes
and
such
matters
and
to
entreat
him
to
make
an
effort
to
improve
it
one
can
imagine
how
much
he
must
have
disliked
the
commission
anyhow
he
decided
it
would
be
better
to
do
it
away
from
home
and
he
suggested
to
gilbert
a
trip
to
the
seaside
arrived
there
he
broached
the
subject
gilbert
he
says
was
not
the
least
angry
but
answered
quite
seriously
that
frances
loved
him
as
he
was
and
that
it
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
try
to
alter
it
was
only
out
of
a
later
and
deeper
experience
of
women
that
he
was
able
to
write
a
man
friends
like
him
but
they
leave
him
as
he
is
a
man
wife
loves
him
and
is
always
trying
to
change
him
a
good
many
things
happened
in
the
course
of
this
long
engagement
frances
and
gilbert
were
both
young
and
long
engagements
were
normal
at
that
period
when
the
idea
of
a
wife
continuing
to
earn
after
marriage
was
unheard
of
there
were
obvious
disadvantages
in
the
long
delay
before
marriage
but
also
certain
advantages
the
two
got
to
know
each
other
with
a
close
intimacy
they
were
comrades
as
well
as
lovers
and
carried
both
these
relationships
into
married
life
for
the
biographer
the
advantage
has
been
immense
since
every
separation
between
the
pair
meant
a
batch
of
letters
the
discerning
will
have
noted
that
there
are
in
these
letters
considerable
excisions
parts
frances
would
not
show
even
to
the
biographer
but
they
are
the
richest
quarry
from
which
to
dig
for
the
most
important
period
of
any
man
life
the
period
richest
in
mental
development
and
the
shaping
of
character
it
is
too
the
only
period
of
his
adult
life
when
gilbert
wrote
letters
at
all
unless
they
were
absolutely
unavoidable
even
in
a
small
family
two
members
will
tend
to
draw
together
more
closely
than
the
rest
and
this
was
so
with
frances
and
her
sister
gertrude
they
adored
one
another
and
frances
offered
her
to
gilbert
as
a
sister
with
especially
confident
pride
he
had
never
had
a
sister
since
babyhood
and
he
enjoyed
it
the
happiness
of
the
engagement
was
terribly
broken
into
by
the
sudden
death
of
gertrude
in
a
street
accident
frances
was
absolutely
shattered
the
next
group
of
letters
belongs
to
the
months
after
gertrude
death
when
gilbert
was
still
trying
to
be
a
publisher
but
urged
on
by
frances
beginning
also
to
be
a
writer
during
part
of
this
time
she
had
gone
abroad
for
rest
and
recovery
after
the
shock
gilbert
pictures
her
reading
his
letters
under
the
shadow
of
an
alien
cathedral
none
of
these
letters
are
dated
but
most
of
them
have
kept
their
postmarks

i
am
black
but
comely
at
this
moment
because
the
cyclostyle
has
blacked
me
fear
not
i
shall
wash
myself
but
i
think
it
my
duty
to
render
an
accurate
account
of
my
physical
appearance
every
time
i
write
and
shall
be
glad
of
any
advice
and
assistance
i
have
been
reading
lewis
carroll
remains
mostly
logic
and
have
much
pleasure
in
enlivening
you
with
the
following
hilarious
query
can
a
hypothetical
whose
protasis
is
false
be
legitimate
are
two
hypotheticals
of
the
forms
a
then
and
a
then
not
compatible
i
should
think
a
hypothetical
could
be
if
it
tried
hard
to
return
to
the
cyclostyle
i
like
the
cyclostyle
ink
it
is
so
inky
i
do
not
think
there
is
anyone
who
takes
quite
such
a
fierce
pleasure
in
things
being
themselves
as
i
do
the
startling
wetness
of
water
excites
and
intoxicates
me
the
fieriness
of
fire
the
steeliness
of
steel
the
unutterable
muddiness
of
mud
it
is
just
the
same
with
people
when
we
call
a
man
manly
or
a
woman
womanly
we
touch
the
deepest
philosophy
i
will
not
ask
you
to
forgive
this
rambling
levity
i
for
one
have
sworn
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
it
by
the
sword
of
god
that
has
struck
us
and
before
the
beautiful
face
of
the
dead
that
the
first
joke
that
occurred
to
me
i
would
make
the
first
nonsense
poem
i
thought
of
i
would
write
that
i
would
begin
again
at
once
with
a
heavy
heart
at
times
as
to
other
duties
to
the
duty
of
being
perfectly
silly
perfectly
extravagant
perfectly
trivial
and
as
far
as
possible
amusing
i
have
sworn
that
gertrude
should
not
feel
wherever
she
is
that
the
comedy
has
gone
out
of
our
theatre
this
i
am
well
aware
will
be
misunderstood
but
i
have
long
grasped
that
whatever
we
do
we
are
misunderstood
small
blame
to
other
people
for
we
know
ourselves
our
best
motives
are
things
we
could
neither
explain
nor
defend
and
i
would
rather
hurt
those
who
can
shout
than
her
who
is
silent
you
might
tell
me
what
you
feel
about
this
but
i
am
myself
absolutely
convinced
that
gaiety
that
is
the
bubble
of
love
does
not
annoy
me
the
old
round
of
stories
laughter
family
ceremonies
seems
to
me
far
less
really
inappropriate
than
a
single
moment
of
forced
silence
or
unmanly
shame
i
have
always
imagined
frances
did
not
know
of
her
mother
efforts
to
tidy
gilbert
but
very
early
in
their
engagement
she
began
her
own
abortive
attempts
to
make
him
brush
his
hair
tie
his
tie
straight
and
avoid
ones
attend
to
the
buttons
on
his
coat
and
all
the
rest
it
would
seem
that
for
a
time
at
any
rate
he
made
some
efforts
but
evidently
simply
regarded
the
whole
thing
as
one
huge
joke

if
there
were
such
a

it

can
not

dreaming

some
wild
in
which
the
whole
round

should
be
a
boiling
pot
with
the
flames
of
purgatory
under
it

that
soon
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
such
a
thing
as
boiled
mountains
boiled
cities
and
a
boiled
moon

a
tremendous
picture
yet
i
am
perfectly
happy
as
usual
after
all
why
should
we
object
to
be
boiled
potatoes
for
example
are
better
boiled
than
raw
why
should
we
fear
to
be
boiled
into
new
shapes
in

cauldron
these
things
are
an
allegory
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
that
in
your
own
words
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
where
you
are
at

the
same
remark
if
i
remember
right
was
made
on

mountain
of

it
has
always
been
one
of
my
unclerical
sermons
to
myself
that
that
remark
which
peter
made
on
seeing
the
vision
of
a
single
hour
ought
to
be
made
by
us
all
in
contemplating
every
panoramic
change
in
the
long
vision
we
call
life

things
superficially
but
this
always
in
our
depths
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here
it
is
good
for
us
to
be
here

itself
eternally
and
if
after
many
joys
and
festivals
and
frivolities
it
should
be
our
fate
to
have
to
look
on

one
of

is
in
a
most
awful
sense
of
the
words
transfigured
before
our

promise
to
send
him
some
chapters
of
it
i
certainly
can
not
complain
of
not
being
sympathetically
treated
by
the
literary
men
i
know
i
wonder
where
the
jealous
spiteful
depreciating
man
of
letters
we
read
of
in
books
has
got
to
it
about
time
he
turned
up
i
think
excuse
me
for
talking
about
these
trivialities
i
have
made
a
discovery
or
i
should
say
seen
a
vision
i
saw
it
between
two
cups
of
black
coffee
in
a
gallic
restaurant
in
soho
but
i
could
not
express
it
if
i
tried
but
this
was
one
thing
that
it
said
that
all
good
things
are
one
thing
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
gravestone
of
gertrude
and
a
tune
played
by
mildred
wain
but
there
is
everlasting
conflict
between
the
gravestone
of
gertrude
and
the
obscene
pomposity
of
the
hired
mute
and
there
is
everlasting
conflict
between
the
tune
and
any
mean
or
vulgar
words
to
which
it
may
be
set
these
which
man
hath
joined
together
god
shall
most
surely
sunder
that
is
what
i
am
feeling
now
every
hour
of
the
day
all
good
things
are
one
thing
sunsets
schools
of
philosophy
babies
constellations
cathedrals
operas
mountains
horses
poems
all
these
are
merely
disguises
one
thing
is
always
walking
among
us
in
in
the
grey
cloak
of
a
church
or
the
green
cloak
of
a
meadow
he
is
always
behind
his
form
makes
the
folds
fall
so
superbly
and
that
is
what
the
savage
old
hebrews
alone
among
the
nations
guessed
and
why
their
rude
tribal
god
has
been
erected
on
the
ruins
of
all
polytheistic
civilisations
for
the
greeks
and
norsemen
and
romans
saw
the
superficial
wars
of
nature
and
made
the
sun
one
god
the
sea
another
the
wind
a
third
they
were
not
thrilled
as
some
rude
israelite
was
one
night
in
the
wastes
alone
by
the
sudden
blazing
idea
of
all
being
the
same
god
an
idea
worthy
of
a
detective
story
paternoster
buildings
postmarked
july
costume
slightly
improved
the
truth
is
that
a
mystical
and
fantastic
development
has
taken
place
my
clothes
have
rebelled
against
me
weary
of
scorn
and
neglect
they
have
all
suddenly
come
to
life
and
they
dress
me
by
force
every
morning
my
frockcoat
leaps
upon
me
like
a
lion
and
hangs
on
dragging
me
down
as
i
struggle
my
boots
trip
me
up
and
the
laces
climb
up
my
feet
never
missing
a
hole
like
snakes
or
creepers
at
the
same
moment
the
celebrated
grey
tie
springs
at
my
throat
like
a
wild
cat
i
am
told
that
the
general
effects
produced
by
this
remarkable
psychical
development
are
superb
really
the
clothes
must
know
best
still
it
is
awkward
when
a
mackintosh
pursues
one
down
the
street
there
is
nothing
in
god
earth
that
really
expresses
the
bottom
of
the
nature
of
a
man
in
love
except
burns
songs
to
the
man
not
in
love
they
must
seem
inexplicably
simple
when
he
says
my
love
is
like
the
melody
that
sweetly
played
in
tune
it
seems
almost
a
crude
way
of
referring
to
music
but
a
man
in
love
with
a
woman
feels
a
nerve
move
suddenly
that
dante
groped
for
and
shakespeare
hardly
touched
what
made
me
think
of
burns
however
was
that
one
of
his
simple
and
sudden
things
hitting
the
right
nail
so
that
it
rings
occurs
in
the
song
of
o
a
the
airts
the
wind
can
blaw
where
he
merely
says
that
there
is
nothing
beautiful
anywhere
but
it
makes
him
think
of
the
woman
that
is
not
really
a
mere
aesthetic
fancy
a
chain
of
sentimental
association
it
is
an
actual
instinctive
elemental
movement
of
the
mind
performed
automatically
and
instantly

i
have
as
you
see
arrived
here
i
have
done
other
daring
things
such
as
having
my
hair
shampooed
as
you
commanded
and
also
cut
the
effect
of
this
is
so
singularly
horrible
that
i
have
found
further
existence
in
london
impossible
public
opinion
is
too
strong
for
me
there
are
many
other
reasons
i
could
give
for
being
pleased
to
come
such
as
that
i
have
some
time
for
writing
the
novel
that
i
can
make
up
stories
i
do
intend
to
write
that
there
are
phosphorescent
colours
on
the
sea
and
a
box
of
cigarettes
on
the
mantelpiece
some
fragments
of
what
i
felt
about
gertrude
death
have
struggled
out
in
the
form
of
some
verses
which
i
am
writing
out
for
you
but
for
real
strength
i
do
like
the
word
comfort
for
real
peace
no
human
words
are
much
good
except
perhaps
some
of
the
unfathomable
unintelligible
unconquerable
epigrams
of
the
bible
i
remember
when
bentley
had
a
burning
boyish
admiration
for
professor
huxley
and
when
that
scientist
died
some
foolish
friend
asked
him
quite
flippantly
in
a
letter
what
he
felt
about
it
bentley
replied
with
the
chapter
and
verse
reference
to
one
of
the
psalms
alone
on
a
postcard
the
text
was
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
one
of
his
saints
the
friend
i
remember
thought
it
a
curious
remark
about
huxley
it
strikes
me
as
a
miraculous
remark
about
anybody
it
is
one
of
those
magic
sayings
where
every
word
hits
a
chain
of
association
god
knows
how
precious
we
could
not
say
that
gertrude
death
is
happy
or
providential
or
sweet
or
even
perhaps
good
but
it
is
something
beautiful
is
a
good
word
but
precious
is
the
only
right
word
it
is
this
passionate
sense
of
the
of
things
of
the
richness
of
the
cosmic
treasure
the
world
where
every
star
is
a
diamond
every
leaf
an
emerald
every
drop
of
blood
a
ruby
it
is
this
sense
of
preciousness
that
is
really
awakened
by
the
death
of
his
saints
somehow
we
feel
that
even
their
death
is
a
thing
of
incalculable
value
and
mysterious
sweetness
it
is
awful
tragic
desolating
desperately
hard
to
bear
but
still
precious
forgive
the
verbosity
of
one
whose
trade
it
is
to
express
the
inexpressible
the
verses
he
speaks
of
in
this
letter
frances
treasured
greatly
she
showed
them
to
me
in
a
book
which
opens
with
a
very
touching
prayer
in
her
own
writing
in
a
later
chapter
i
quote
the
lines
in
which
gilbert
writes
of
his
own
and
of
how
he
saw
what
music
meant
as
he
watched
his
wife
face
something
of
the
same
effect
is
produced
on
me
by
these
verses
gilbert
was
not
of
course
to
this
tragedy
yet
it
was
chiefly
in
its
effect
on
frances
that
it
affected
him
the
sudden
sorrow
smote
my
love
that
often
falls
twixt
kiss
and
kiss
and
looking
forth
awhile
she
said
can
no
man
tell
me
where
she
is
and
again
stricken
they
sat
and
through
them
moved
my
own
dear
lady
pale
and
sweet
this
soul
whose
clearness
makes
afraid
our
souls
this
wholly
guiltless
one
no
cobweb
doubts
no
passion
smoke
have
veiled
this
mirror
from
thy
sun
in
letters
to
frances
he
could
enter
so
deeply
into
her
grief
as
to
make
it
his
own
but
when
he
wrote
verse
and
spoke
as
it
were
to
himself
or
to
god
the
reflected
emotion
was
not
enough
these
verses
could
never
rank
with
his
real
poetry
it
was
not
possible
in
fact
for
a
man
so
happily
in
love
to
dwell
lastingly
on
any
sorrow
and
i
can
not
avoid
the
feeling
that
quite
apart
from
any
theory
cheerfulness
was
constantly
breaking
in
for
gilbert
was
a
very
happy
man
across
the
top
of
one
of
his
letters
is
written
you
can
always
tell
the
real
love
from
the
slight
by
the
fact
that
the
latter
weakens
at
the
moment
of
success
the
former
is
quadrupled
the
next
of
his
letters
is
a
mingling
of
the
comic
and
the
fantastic
very
special
to
paternoster
buildings
postmarked
i
fear
as
you
say
that
my
letters
do
not
contain
many
practical
details
about
myself
the
letters
are
not
very
long
to
begin
with
as
i
think
it
better
to
write
something
every
day
than
a
long
letter
when
i
have
leisure
and
when
i
have
a
little
time
to
think
in
i
always
think
of
the
kosmos
first
and
the
ego
afterwards
i
admit
however
that
you
are
not
engaged
to
the
kosmos
dear
me
what
a
time
the
kosmos
would
have
all
its
comets
would
have
their
hair
brushed
every
morning
the
whirlwind
would
be
adjured
not
to
walk
about
when
it
was
talking
the
oceans
would
be
warmed
with
pipes
not
even
the
lowest
forms
of
life
would
escape
the
crusade
of
tidiness
you
would
walk
round
and
round
the
jellyfish
looking
for
a
place
to
put
in
under
these
circumstances
then
i
can
not
but
regard
it
as
fortunate
that
you
are
only
engaged
to
your
obedient
microcosm
a
biped
inheriting
some
of
the
traits
of
his
mother
the
kosmos
its
untidiness
its
largeness
its
irritating
imperfection
and
its
profound
and
hearty
intention
to
go
on
existing
as
long
as
it
possibly
can
i
can
understand
what
you
mean
about
wanting
details
about
me
for
i
want
just
the
same
about
you
you
need
only
tell
me
i
went
down
the
street
to
a
i
shall
know
that
you
did
it
in
a
manner
blindingly
staggeringly
crazily
beautiful
it
is
quite
true
as
you
say
that
i
am
a
person
wearing
clothes
with
a
kind
of
hair
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
that
there
is
something
scorchingly
sarcastic
about
the
underlining
in
this
passage
as
to
what
i
do
every
day
it
depends
on
which
way
you
want
it
narrated
what
we
all
say
it
is
or
what
it
really
is
what
we
all
say
happens
every
day
is
this
i
wake
up
dress
myself
eat
bacon
and
bread
and
coffee
for
breakfast
walk
up
to
high
station
take
a
fourpenny
ticket
for
blackfriars
read
the
chronicle
in
the
train
arrive
at
paternoster
buildings
read
a
ms
called
the
lepers
light
comedy
reading
and
another
called
the
preparation
of
ryerson
embury
you
know
the
style
till
go
out
to
lunch
have
but
here
perhaps
it
would
be
safer
to
become
vague
come
back
work
till
six
take
my
hat
and
and
come
home
have
dinner
at
home
write
the
novel
till
then
write
to
you
and
go
to
bed
that
is
what
we
in
our
dreamy
deluded
way
really
imagine
is
the
thing
that
happens
what
really
happens
but
hist
are
we
observed
is
as
follows
out
of
the
starless
night
of
the
uncreated
that
was
before
the
stars
a
soul
begins
to
grope
back
to
light
it
gropes
its
way
through
strange
chambers
of
dreams
where
in
a
brown
and
gold
twilight
it
sees
many
things
that
are
dimly
significant
true
stories
twisted
into
new
and
amazing
shapes
human
beings
whom
it
knew
long
ago
sitting
at
the
windows
by
dark
sunsets
or
talking
in
dim
meadows
but
the
awful
invading
light
grows
stronger
in
the
dreams
till
the
soul
in
one
last
struggle
plunges
into
a
body
as
into
a
house
and
wakes
up
within
it
then
he
rises
and
finds
himself
in
a
wonderful
vast
world
of
white
light
and
clear
frankly
coloured
shapes
an
inheritor
of
a
million
stars
on
enquiry
he
is
informed
that
his
name
is
gilbert
keith
chesterton
this
amuses
him
he
goes
through
a
number
of
extraordinary
and
fantastic
rituals
which
the
pompous
elfland
he
has
entered
demands
the
first
is
that
he
shall
get
inside
a
house
of
clothing
a
tower
of
wool
and
flax
that
he
shall
put
on
this
foolish
armour
solemnly
one
piece
after
another
and
each
in
its
right
place
the
things
called
sleevelinks
he
attends
to
minutely
his
hair
he
beats
angrily
with
a
bristly
tool
for
this
is
the
law
downstairs
a
more
monstrous
ceremony
attends
him
he
has
to
put
things
inside
himself
he
does
so
being
naturally
polite
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
a
weird
satisfaction
follows
he
takes
a
sword
in
his
hand
for
what
may
not
befall
him
in
so
strange
a
country
and
goes
forth
he
finds
a
hole
in
the
wall
a
little
cave
wherein
sits
one
who
can
give
him
the
charm
that
rules
the
horse
of
water
and
fire
he
finds
an
opening
and
descends
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
down
among
the
roots
of
the
eternal
hills
he
finds
a
sunless
temple
wherein
he
prays
and
in
the
centre
of
it
he
finds
a
lighted
temple
in
which
he
enters
then
there
are
noises
as
of
an
earthquake
and
smoke
and
fire
in
the
darkness
and
when
he
opens
the
door
again
he
is
in
another
temple
out
of
which
he
climbs
into
another
world
leagues
and
leagues
away
and
when
he
asks
the
meaning
of
the
vision
they
talk
gibberish
and
say
it
is
a
train
so
the
day
goes
full
of
eerie
publishers
and
elfin
clerks
till
he
returns
and
again
puts
things
inside
him
and
then
sits
down
and
makes
men
in
his
own
head
and
writes
down
all
that
they
said
and
did
and
last
of
all
comes
the
real
life
itself
for
he
writes
words
upon
a
scrap
of
paper
words
that
are
not
picked
and
chosen
like
those
that
he
has
used
to
parry
the
strange
talk
of
the
folk
all
day
but
words
in
which
the
soul
blood
pours
out
like
the
body
blood
from
a
wound
he
writes
secretly
this
mad
diary
all
his
passion
and
longing
all
his
queer
religion
his
dark
and
dreadful
gratitude
to
god
his
idle
allegories
the
tales
that
tell
themselves
in
his
head
the
joy
that
comes
on
him
sometimes
he
can
not
help
it
at
the
sacred
intoxication
of
existence
the
million
faults
of
idleness
and
recklessness
and
the
one
virtue
of
the
unconquered
adoration
of
goodness
that
dark
virtue
that
every
man
has
and
hides
deeper
than
all
his
vices
he
writes
all
this
down
as
he
is
writing
it
now
and
he
knows
that
if
he
sticks
it
down
and
puts
a
stamp
on
it
and
drops
it
into
the
mouth
of
a
little
red
goblin
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
knows
that
all
this
wild
soliloquy
will
be
poured
into
the
soul
of
one
wise
and
beautiful
lady
sitting
far
away
beyond
seas
and
rivers
and
cities
under
the
shadow
of
an
alien
cathedral
this
is
not
all
so
irrelevant
as
you
may
think
it
was
this
line
of
feeling
that
taught
me
an
utter
rationalist
as
far
as
dogma
goes
the
lesson
of
the
entire
spirituality
of
things
an
opinion
that
nothing
has
ever
shattered
since
i
ca
express
myself
on
the
point
nobody
can
but
it
is
the
spirituality
of
things
that
we
are
sure
of
that
the
eyes
in
your
face
are
eyes
i
do
not
know
they
may
have
other
names
and
uses
i
know
that
they
are
or
beautiful
or
rather
spiritual
i
do
not
know
on
what
principle
the
universe
is
run
i
know
or
feel
that
it
is
or
spiritual
i
do
not
know
what
gertrude
death
was
i
know
that
it
was
beautiful
for
i
saw
it
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
so
beautiful
now
why
because
we
do
not
see
it
now
what
we
see
now
is
her
absence
but
her
death
is
not
her
absence
but
her
presence
somewhere
else
that
is
what
we
was
beautiful
as
long
as
we
could
see
it
do
not
be
frightened
dearest
by
the
slow
inevitable
laws
of
human
nature
we
shall
climb
back
into
the
mountain
of
vision
we
shall
be
able
to
use
the
word
with
the
accent
of
whitman
disembodied
triumphant
dead
in
the
he
was
writing
there
is
a
heart
within
a
distant
town
who
loves
me
more
than
treasure
or
renown
think
you
it
strange
and
wear
it
as
a
crown
is
not
the
marvel
here
that
since
the
kiss
and
dizzy
glories
of
that
blinding
bliss
one
grief
has
ever
touched
me
after
this
we
see
gilbert
in
the
next
two
letters
more
concerned
about
a
grand
dinner
of
the
than
about
his
future
fame
and
fortune
in
the
second
he
mentions
almost
casually
that
he
is
leaving
fisher
unwin
from
now
on
he
was
to
live
by
his
pen
warwick
gardens
tuesday
night
nothing
very
astonishing
has
happened
yet
though
many
astonishing
things
will
happen
soon
the
final
perfection
of
humanity
i
expect
shortly
the
for
this
week
the
first
of
the
is
coming
out
soon
and
may
contain
something
of
mine
though
i
can
not
be
quite
sure
a
rush
of
the
boers
on
natal
strategically
quite
possibly
successful
is
anticipated
by
politicians
the
rising
of
the
sun
tomorrow
morning
is
predicted
by
astronomers
my
father
again
is
engaged
in
the
crucial
correspondence
with
fisher
unwin
at
least
it
has
begun
by
stating
his
proposed
terms
a
rise
of
from
october
another
rise
possible
but
undefined
in
january
per
cent
royalty
for
the
paris
book
and
expenses
for
a
fortnight
in
paris
these
as
i
got
my
father
to
heartily
agree
are
vitiated
to
the
bone
as
terms
by
the
absence
of
any
assurance
that
i
shall
not
have
to
write
paris
for
which
i
am
really
paid
nothing
the
hours
of
work
for
which
i
am
paid
in
short
the
net
result
would
be
that
instead
of
gaining
more
liberty
to
rise
in
the
literary
world
i
should
be
selling
the
small
liberty
of
rising
that
i
have
now
for
five
more
shillings
this
my
father
is
declining
and
asking
for
a
better
settlement
the
diplomacy
is
worrying
yet
i
enjoy
it
i
feel
like
chamberlain
on
the
eve
of
war
i
would
stop
with
for
a
year
but
not
for
less
which
means
i
think
that
i
shall
not
stop
at
all
but
all
these
revolutions
literary
financial
and
political
fade
into
insignificance
compared
with
the
one
really
tremendous
event
of
this
week
it
will
take
place
on
saturday
next
the
sun
will
stand
still
upon
leicester
square
and
the
moon
on
the
valley
of
wardour
for
then
will
assemble
the
grand
commemorative
meeting
of
the
junior
debating
club
the
secretary
oldershaw
will
select
a
restaurant
make
arrangements
and
issue
the
proclamations
or
to
use
the
venerable
old
club
phrase
the
writs
when
this
gorgeous
function
is
over
you
must
expect
a
colossal
letter
everyone
of
the
old
brotherhood
scattered
over
many
cities
and
callings
has
hailed
the
invitation
and
is
coming
with
the
exception
of
bentley
who
will
send
a
sensational
telegram
from
paris
the
fun
is
expected
to
be
fast
and
furious
the
undercurrent
of
emotion
twelve
years
old
is
not
likely
to
be
much
disguised
as
i
say
i
will
write
you
a
sumptuous
description
of
it
it
is
somewhat
your
due
for
the
thing
is
and
always
will
be
one
of
the
main
strands
of
my
life
none
can
say
what
will
occur
it
is
one
of
those
occasions
when
englishmen
are
not
much
like
the
pictures
of
them
in
continental
satires
there
is
more
in
this
old
affair
of
ours
than
possibly
meets
the
eye
it
is
a
thing
that
has
left
its
roots
deep
in
the
hearts
of
twelve
strangely
different
men
and
now
that
seven
of
us
have
found
the
new
life
that
can
only
be
found
in
woman
it
would
be
mean
indeed
not
to
turn
back
and
thank
the
old
warwick
gardens
this
is
the
colossal
letter
i
trust
you
will
excuse
me
if
the
paper
is
conceived
on
a
similar
scale
of
babylonian
immensity
i
can
not
make
out
exactly
whether
i
did
or
did
not
post
a
letter
i
wrote
to
you
on
saturday
if
i
did
not
i
apologise
for
missing
the
day
if
i
did
you
will
know
by
this
time
one
or
two
facts
that
may
interest
you
the
chief
of
which
is
that
i
am
certainly
leaving
fisher
unwin
with
much
mutual
courtesy
and
goodwill
this
fact
may
interest
you
i
repeat
at
this
moment
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
interests
me
for
my
head
to
say
nothing
of
another
organ
is
filled
with
the
thundering
cheers
and
songs
of
the
dinner
on
saturday
night
it
was
i
may
say
without
hesitation
a
breathless
success
cholmeley
who
must
be
experienced
being
both
a
schoolmaster
a
diner
out
and
a
clever
man
told
me
he
had
never
in
his
life
heard
eleven
better
speeches
i
quite
agree
with
him
merely
adding
his
own
everyone
was
amusing
and
what
is
much
better
singularly
characteristic
will
you
forgive
me
dearest
if
i
reel
off
to
the
only
soul
that
can
be
trusted
to
enjoy
my
enjoyment
a
kind
of
report
of
the
meeting
it
will
revivify
my
own
memories
and
one
thing
at
least
that
i
said
in
my
speech
i
thoroughly
believed
in
if
there
is
any
prayer
i
should
be
inclined
to
make
it
is
that
i
should
forget
nothing
in
my
life
the
proceedings
opened
with
dinner
the
illustrated
menus
were
wildly
appreciated
every
person
got
all
the
rest
to
sign
on
the
menu
and
then
took
it
away
as
a
memento
then
the
telegrams
from
kruger
chamberlain
dreyfus
and
george
meredith
were
read
then
i
proposed
the
toast
of
the
queen
i
merely
said
that
nothing
could
ever
be
alleged
against
the
queen
except
the
fact
that
she
is
not
a
member
of
the
and
that
i
thought
it
spoke
well
for
the
chivalry
of
englishmen
that
with
this
fact
she
had
never
been
publicly
taunted
i
said
i
knew
that
the
virtues
of
queen
victoria
had
become
somewhat
platitudinous
but
i
thought
it
was
a
fortunate
country
in
which
the
virtues
of
its
powerful
ones
are
platitudes
the
toast
was
then
drunk
after
a
pause
and
a
little
conversation
i
called
upon
lawrence
solomon
to
propose
the
toast
of
the
school
he
was
very
amusing
indeed
most
of
his
speech
would
not
be
very
comprehensible
to
an
outsider
for
it
largely
consisted
of
an
ingenious
of
the
sentences
in
the
latin
and
greek
arnold
i
shall
never
forget
the
lucid
and
precise
enunciation
with
which
he
delivered
the
idiotic
sentences
in
those
works
more
especially
where
he
said
such
a
course
would
be
more
agreeable
to
cholmeley
and
i
would
rather
gratify
such
a
man
as
he
than
see
the
king
of
the
persians
cholmeley
amid
roars
of
welcome
rose
to
respond
i
think
i
must
have
told
you
in
a
former
letter
that
cholmeley
is
a
former
classmaster
of
ours
a
former
of
bentley
and
one
of
the
nicest
men
at
paul
we
invited
him
as
the
only
visitor
he
said
a
great
deal
that
was
very
amusing
mostly
a
commentary
on
solomon
remarks
about
the
latin
arnold
one
remark
he
made
was
that
he
possessed
one
particular
latin
arnold
formerly
the
property
of
the
president
which
he
had
withdrawn
from
him
with
every
expression
of
contumely
because
it
was
drawn
all
over
with
devils
he
made
some
very
sound
remarks
about
the
club
as
an
answer
to
the
common
charge
against
paul
school
that
it
was
aridly
scholastic
without
spontaneous
growth
in
culture
or
sentiment
then
fordham
proposed
the
ladies
he
was
killing
fordham
is
a
personality
whom
i
think
you
do
not
know
he
is
one
of
the
most
profoundly
humourous
men
i
ever
knew
but
his
humour
is
more
thickly
coated
on
him
so
to
speak
than
bentley
or
oldershaw
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
make
him
serious
he
is
one
of
the
most
fascinating
typical
englishmen
i
ever
knew
strong
generous
flippant
on
principle
rowdy
by
physical
inspiration
successful
popular
married
a
man
to
discharge
all
the
normal
functions
of
life
well
but
his
most
entertaining
gift
which
he
displayed
truly
sumptuously
on
this
occasion
is
a
wonderful
gift
of
burlesque
and
stereotyped
rhetoric
with
melodramatic
gestures
he
drew
attention
to
the
torrents
of
the
president
blood
pouring
from
the
wound
of
the
tiny
god
amid
sympathetic
demonstration
he
protested
against
the
pathos
of
the
toast
the
conquered
on
the
field
of
battle
toasting
the
conquerors
as
the
only
married
member
of
the
club
he
ventured
to
give
us
some
advice
on
a
food
b
education
c
intercourse
he
sat
down
in
a
pure
whirlwind
of
folly
without
saying
a
word
about
the
feelings
that
were
in
all
hearts
including
his
own
just
then
but
i
was
delighted
to
find
that
marriage
had
not
taken
away
an
inch
of
his
incurable
silliness
nothing
could
be
a
greater
contrast
than
the
few
graceful
and
dignified
but
very
restrained
words
in
which
bertram
responded
to
the
toast
he
is
not
a
man
who
cares
to
make
fun
of
women
however
genially
then
came
whom
i
called
upon
to
propose
the
club
his
was
perhaps
the
most
interesting
case
of
all
when
i
knew
in
the
junior
debating
club
he
was
one
of
the
most
frivolous
young
men
i
ever
knew
but
knowing
that
he
was
a
good
speaker
in
a
light
style
and
had
been
president
of
the
cambridge
union
i
put
him
down
to
propose
the
club
thinking
that
we
should
have
enough
serious
speaking
and
would
be
well
to
err
on
the
side
of
entertainment
got
up
and
proceeded
to
deliver
a
speech
that
made
me
jump
it
was
i
thought
the
best
speech
of
the
evening
but
i
am
sure
it
was
the
most
serious
the
most
sympathetic
and
a
long
way
the
most
frankly
emotional
he
said
that
the
club
was
not
now
a
club
in
the
strict
sense
it
was
two
things
preeminently
and
everlastingly
a
memory
and
an
influence
he
spoke
with
a
singular
sort
of
subdued
vividness
of
the
influence
the
club
had
had
on
him
in
boyhood
he
then
turned
to
the
history
of
the
club
and
here
my
dearest
lady
i
am
pained
to
have
to
report
that
he
launched
suddenly
and
dramatically
into
a
most
extraordinary
and
apparently
quite
sincere
eulogium
upon
myself
and
the
influence
i
had
on
my
schoolfellows
i
will
not
repeat
his
words
i
did
not
believe
them
but
they
took
me
by
surprise
and
shook
me
somewhat
i
may
remark
and
yourself
are
the
only
persons
who
have
ever
employed
the
word
genius
in
connection
with
me
i
trust
it
will
not
occur
again
i
replied
my
speech
was
a
medley
but
it
appeared
very
successful
i
discussed
largely
the
absence
of
any
successor
to
the
i
described
how
i
watched
the
boys
leaving
school
today
a
solitary
figure
clad
in
the
latest
fashion
moodily
pacing
the
hammersmith
road
and
asked
myself
where
among
these
is
the
girlish
gush
of
a
bentley
the
passionate
volubility
of
a
vernède
the
shyness
of
a
fordham
i
admitted
that
we
had
had
misfortunes
one
of
us
had
a
serious
illness
another
had
had
a
very
good
story
in
the
strand
magazine
but
i
thought
that
a
debating
club
of
members
that
had
given
three
presidents
to
the
university
unions
had
not
done
badly
the
rest
was
sentimental
then
began
a
most
extraordinary
game
of
battledore
and
shuttlecock
vernède
proposed
the
secretary
oldershaw
oldershaw
instead
of
replying
properly
proposed
bentley
and
the
absent
members
waldo
responded
for
these
or
rather
instead
of
responding
proposed
maurice
solomon
maurice
solomon
instead
of
responding
proposed
salter
the
latter
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
spoken
and
on
rising
he
explained
his
reasons
for
refusing
he
had
not
been
in
the
same
room
with
cholmeley
he
said
since
he
had
sat
five
years
ago
in
the
lower
fourth
and
cholmeley
had
told
him
that
he
talked
too
much
he
had
no
desire
on
his
first
reappearance
to
create
in
cholmeley
mind
the
idea
that
he
had
been
at
it
ever
since
after
this
we
passed
on
to
singing
and
nearly
brought
down
the
roof
of
pinoli
restaurant
cholmeley
the
awful
being
of
whose
classic
taste
in
greek
iambics
i
once
stood
in
awe
sang
with
great
feeling
a
fragment
of
lyric
literature
of
which
the
following
was
as
far
as
i
remember
the
refrain
singing
also
and
chanting
not
forgetting
vernède
sang
a
sussex
pothouse
chorus
in
an
indolent
and
refined
way
which
was
exquisitely
incongruous
waldo
and
also
sang
i
recited
an
ode
which
i
had
written
for
the
occasion
and
lucian
recited
one
of
bentley
poems
that
came
out
in
an
oxford
magazine
then
we
sang
the
of
the
of
which
the
words
are
i
am
a
member
i
a
member
member
of
the
i
belong
to
it
forever
do
you
wish
that
you
were
me
it
was
sung
to
the
tune
of
clementine
then
we
paid
the
bill
then
we
borrowed
each
other
arms
and
legs
in
an
inextricable
tangle
and
sang
auld
lang
syne
then
we
broke
up
there
now
five
mortal
pages
of
writing
and
nothing
about
you
in
it
how
relieved
you
must
be
wearied
out
with
allusions
to
your
hair
and
your
soul
and
your
clothes
and
your
eyes
and
yet
it
has
been
every
word
of
it
about
you
really
i
like
to
make
my
past
vivid
to
you
especially
this
past
not
only
because
it
was
on
the
whole
a
fine
healthy
foolish
manly
enthusiastic
idiotic
past
with
the
very
soul
of
youth
in
it
not
only
because
i
am
a
victim
of
the
prejudice
common
i
trust
to
all
mankind
that
no
one
ever
had
such
friends
as
i
had
readers
of
the
will
remember
that
many
many
years
later
at
the
celebration
of
hilaire
belloc
sixtieth
birthday
the
guests
threw
the
ball
to
one
another
in
just
this
same
fashion
chesterton
had
by
then
so
far
forgotten
this
earlier
occasion
that
he
spoke
of
the
belloc
birthday
party
as
the
only
dinner
in
his
life
at
which
every
diner
made
a
speech
two
more
extracts
from
his
letters
must
be
given
showing
the
efforts
made
by
frances
to
look
after
gilbert
and
his
reactions
one
of
his
friends
remarked
that
gilbert
life
was
unique
in
that
never
having
left
home
for
a
boarding
school
or
university
he
passed
from
the
care
of
his
mother
to
the
care
of
his
wife
i
think
too
that
the
degree
of
his
physical
helplessness
affected
all
who
came
near
him
with
the
feeling
that
while
he
might
lead
them
where
he
would
intellectually
it
was
their
task
to
look
after
a
body
that
would
otherwise
be
wholly
neglected
the
old
religionists
used
to
talk
about
a
man
being
a
fool
for
christ
sake
certainly
i
have
been
a
blithering
fool
for
your
sake
i
went
to
see
the
doctor
as
you
requested
he
asked
me
what
he
could
do
for
me
i
told
him
i
had
the
least
idea
but
people
thought
my
cold
had
been
going
on
long
enough
he
said
i
no
doubt
it
has
he
then
to
afford
some
relief
to
the
idiotic
futility
of
the
situation
wrote
me
a
prescription
which
i
read
on
my
way
up
to
business
weeping
over
the
pathetic
parts
and
laughing
heartily
at
the
funny
ones
i
have
since
had
some
of
it
it
tastes
pretty
aimless
i
can
not
remember
for
certain
whether
i
mentioned
in
my
letter
that
i
had
had
an
invitation
including
yourself
from
my
aunt
kate
for
this
friday
as
you
do
not
refer
to
it
i
expect
i
did
so
i
wrote
to
her
giving
both
our
thanks
and
explaining
the
state
of
affairs
all
is
over
i
said
between
that
lady
and
myself
do
not
name
her
to
me
lest
the
hideous
word
should
blind
me
to
the
seraphic
word
my
life
is
a
howling
waste
but
what
matter
ha
ha
ha
i
can
not
remember
my
exact
words
of
course
i
am
a
revolting
object
my
hair
is
a
matted
chaos
spread
all
over
the
floor
my
beard
is
like
a
hard
broom
my
necktie
is
on
the
wrong
way
up
my
bootlaces
trail
down
fleet
why
not
when
one
attempts
at
reformation
are
not
much
believed
in

course
is

a
contemptuous
relapse
into
liberty
your
last
letter
makes
me
much
happier
i
put
great
faith
in
the
healing
power
of
the
great
winds
and
the
sun
nature
as
walt
whitman
says
and
her
primal
sanities
s
also
is
a
primal
sanity
it
is
not
i
believe
considered
complimentary
in
a
common
way
to
approach
an
attractive
lady
and
say
pleasantly
you
are
thousands
of
years
old
or
you
seem
to
me
as
old
as
the
mountains
therefore
i
do
not
say
it
but
i
always
feel
that
anyone
beautiful
and
strong
is
really
old
for
the
really
old
things
are
not
decrepit
decrepit
things
are
dying
early
the
roman
empire
was
decrepit
a
sunrise
cloud
is
old
so
i
think
there
are
some
people
who
even
in
their
youth
seem
to
have
existed
always
they
bear
the
mark
of
the
elemental
things
the
things
that
recur
they
are
as
old
as
springtime
as
old
as
daybreak
as
old
as
youth

and

were

only
a

remained

most
of
whom
were
pacifists
or
cranks
of
one
kind
or
another
to
the
sane
minority
of
this
minority
gilbert
found
himself
belonging
it
is
something
of
a
tribute
to
the
national
feeling
at
such
a
moment
of
tension
that
as
an
american
has
noted
chesterton
was
the
one
british
writer
utterly
unknown
before
who
built
up
a
great
reputation
and
it
was
gained
not
through
nationalistic
support
but
through
determined
and
persistent
opposition
to
british
policy
by
cyril
clemens
p
in
his
column
a
correspondent
later
asked
him
to
define
his
position
chesterton
replied
the
unreasonable
patriot
is
one
who
sees
the
faults
of
his
fatherland
with
an
eye
which
is
clearer
and
more
merciless
than
any
eye
of
hatred
the
eye
of
an
irrational
and
irrevocable
love
his
attitude
sprang
he
claimed
not
from
defect
but
from
excess
of
patriotism
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
that
would
clarify
better
the
ideas
of
a
strong
mind
than
finding
itself
in
opposition
this
opposition
began
at
home
in
argument
with
cecil
later
the
two
brothers
would
agree
about
most
main
issues
but
now
cecil
was
a
tory
democrat
gilbert
a
and
what
was
known
as
a
little
englander
the
tie
between
the
two
brothers
was
very
close
as
the
innocent
child
developed
into
the
combative
companion
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
proportionately
affected
gilbert
all
their
friends
talk
of
the
endless
amicable
arguments
through
which
both
grew
conrad
noel
remembers
parties
at
warwick
gardens
during
the
boer
war
at
which
the
two
brothers
would
walk
up
and
down
like
the
two
pistons
of
an
engine
to
the
disorganisation
of
the
company
and
the
dismay
of
their
parents
it
was
at
this
time
that
frances
engaged
to
a
deeply
devoted
gilbert
found
even
that
devotion
insufficient
to
pry
him
and
cecil
apart
when
an
argument
had
got
well
under
way
i
must
go
home
gilbert
i
shall
miss
my
train
usually
he
would
have
sprung
to
accompany
her
but
now
she
must
miss
many
trains
before
the
brothers
could
be
separated
frances
told
me
that
when
they
were
at
the
seaside
the
landlady
would
sometimes
clear
away
breakfast
leaving
the
brothers
arguing
come
to
set
lunch
and
later
set
dinner
while
still
they
argued
they
had
come
to
the
seaside
but
they
never
saw
the
sea
once
frances
was
staying
with
them
at
a
house
they
had
taken
by
the
sea
her
room
was
next
to
cecil
and
she
could
not
sleep
for
the
noise
of
the
discussion
that
went
on
hour
after
hour
about
one
in
the
morning
she
rapped
on
the
wall
and
said
o
cecil
do
send
gilbert
to
bed
a
brief
silence
followed
and
then
the
remark
in
a
rather
abashed
voice
there
no
one
here
cecil
had
been
arguing
with
himself
gilbert
too
argued
with
himself
for
the
stand
he
was
taking
was
a
hard
one
belloc
has
told
me
that
he
felt
gilbert
suffered
at
any
word
against
england
that
his
patriotism
was
passionate
and
now
he
had
himself
to
say
that
he
believed
his
country
to
be
in
the
wrong
to
admit
it
to
himself
to
state
it
to
others
this
autumn
of
began
to
write
for
the
the
weekly
of
this
title
had
long
been
in
a
languishing
condition
when
it
was
taken
over
by
a
group
of
young
liberals
of
very
marked
views
hammond
became
editor
and
philip
comyns
carr
sir
john
simon
was
among
the
group
for
a
short
while
but
he
soon
told
one
of
them
that
he
feared
close
association
with
the
might
injure
his
career
eccles
was
in
charge
of
the
review
department
he
is
able
to
date
the
start
of
what
was
known
as
the
new
with
great
exactitude
for
when
the
first
number
was
going
to
press
the
ultimatum
had
been
sent
to
kruger
and
the
editors
hesitated
as
to
whether
they
should
take
the
risk
of
announcing
that
it
was
war
in
south
africa
they
decided
against
but
before
their
second
number
appeared
war
had
been
declared
my
difficulty
in
getting
a
picture
of
the
first
meeting
of
belloc
and
chesterton
illustrates
the
problem
of
human
testimony
and
the
limits
of
that
problem
for
i
imagine
a
scripture
critic
old
style
would
end
by
concluding
that
the
men
never
met
at
all
eccles
bentley
and
lucian
oldershaw
all
claim
to
have
made
the
momentous
introduction
eccles
adding
that
it
took
place
at
the
office
of
the
while
gilbert
himself
has
described
the
meeting
twice
once
in
the
street
once
in
a
restaurant
belloc
remembers
the
introduction
as
made
in
the
year
by
lucian
oldershaw
who
was
living
at
the
time
with
hammond
oldershaw
usually
has
the
accuracy
of
the
and
upon
this
matter
he
adds
several
amusing
details
for
some
time
he
had
been
trying
to
get
the
group
on
the
to
read
chesterton
and
had
in
vain
taken
several
articles
to
the
office
eccles
declared
the
handwriting
was
that
of
a
jew
and
he
prejudiced
belloc
says
oldershaw
against
reading
anything
written
by
my
jew
friend
but
when
at
last
they
did
meet
belloc
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
in
his
most
pontifical
manner
you
very
well
chesterton
was
then
belloc
four
years
older
it
was
at
the
mont
blanc
a
restaurant
in
gerrard
soho
and
the
meeting
was
celebrated
with
a
bottle
of
moulin
au
vent
the
first
description
given
by
gilbert
himself
is
at
once
earlier
and
more
vivid
than
the
better
known
one
in
the
when
i
first
met
belloc
he
remarked
to
the
friend
who
introduced
us
that
he
was
in
low
spirits
his
low
spirits
were
and
are
much
more
uproarious
and
enlivening
than
anybody
else
high
spirits
he
talked
into
the
night
and
left
behind
in
it
a
glowing
track
of
good
things
when
i
have
said
that
i
mean
things
that
are
good
and
certainly
not
merely
i
have
said
all
that
can
be
said
in
the
most
serious
aspect
about
the
man
who
has
made
the
greatest
fight
for
good
things
of
all
the
men
of
my
time
we
met
between
a
little
soho
paper
shop
and
a
little
soho
restaurant
his
arms
and
pockets
were
stuffed
with
french
nationalist
and
french
atheist
newspapers
he
wore
a
straw
hat
shading
his
eyes
which
are
like
a
sailor
and
emphasizing
his
napoleonic
chin
the
little
restaurant
to
which
we
went
had
already
become
a
haunt
for
three
or
four
of
us
who
held
strong
but
unfashionable
views
about
the
south
african
war
which
was
then
in
its
earliest
prestige
most
of
us
were
writing
on
the
what
he
brought
into
our
dream
was
this
roman
appetite
for
reality
and
for
reason
in
action
and
when
he
came
into
the
door
there
entered
with
him
the
smell
of
danger
introduction
to
belloc
the
man
and
his
by
mandell
and
shanks
it
was
from
that
dingy
little
soho
café
chesterton
writes
in
the
that
there
emerged
the
quadruped
the
twiformed
monster
shaw
has
nicknamed
the
chesterbelloc
listening
to
belloc
is
intoxicating
i
have
heard
many
brilliant
talkers
but
none
to
whom
that
word
can
so
justly
be
applied
he
goes
to
your
head
he
takes
you
off
your
feet
he
leaves
you
breathless
he
can
convince
you
of
anything
my
mother
and
brother
both
counted
it
as
one
of
the
great
experiences
of
their
lives
to
have
dined
with
belloc
in
a
small
paris
restaurant
aux
vendanges
de
bourgogne
and
then
to
have
walked
with
him
the
streets
of
that
glorious
city
while
he
discoursed
of
its
past
imagination
staggers
before
the
picture
of
a
belloc
in
his
full
youth
and
vigour
in
a
group
fitted
to
strike
from
him
his
brightest
fire
at
a
moment
big
with
issues
for
the
world
future
in
chesterton
a
chapter
is
devoted
to
the
portrait
of
a
friend
while
belloc
in
turn
has
said
something
of
chesterton
in
obituary
notices
and
also
in
a
brief
study
of
his
position
in
english
literature
none
of
these
documents
give
much
notion
of
the
intellectual
flame
struck
out
by
one
mind
against
the
other
it
has
often
been
asked
how
much
belloc
influenced
chesterton
the
best
test
of
an
influence
in
a
writer
life
is
to
compare
what
he
wrote
before
with
what
he
wrote
after
he
was
first
subjected
to
it
it
is
easy
to
apply
this
test
to
belloc
influence
on
because
of
the
mass
we
still
have
of
his
boyhood
writings
in
pure
literature
in
philosophy
and
theology
he
remains
untouched
by
the
faintest
change
pages
from
the
notebook
could
be
woven
into
essays
from
introduced
into
victorian
age
in
and
it
would
look
simply
like
buds
and
flowers
on
the
same
bush
belloc
has
characterized
himself
as
ignorant
of
english
literature
and
says
he
learnt
from
chesterton
most
of
what
he
knows
of
it
while
there
is
no
doubt
chesterton
was
by
far
the
greater
philosopher
with
politics
sociology
and
history
and
the
relation
of
religion
to
all
three
it
is
different
belloc
himself
told
me
he
thought
the
chief
thing
he
had
done
for
chesterton
when
they
first
met
was
to
open
his
eyes
to
reality
chesterton
had
been
unusually
young
for
his
years
and
unusually
simple
in
regard
to
the
political
scene
he
was
in
fact
the
young
man
he
himself
was
later
to
describe
as
knowing
all
about
politics
and
nothing
about
politicians
the
four
years
between
the
two
men
seemed
greater
than
it
was
partly
because
of
belloc
more
varied
experience
of
life
french
military
training
life
at
oxford
wide
travel
and
an
early
marriage
belloc
then
could
teach
chesterton
a
certain
realism
about
politics
which
meant
a
certain
cynicism
about
politicians
far
more
valuable
however
was
what
belloc
had
to
give
him
in
sociology
we
have
seen
that
was
already
dissatisfied
with
socialism
before
he
met
belloc
it
may
be
that
by
his
consideration
of
the
nature
of
man
he
would
later
have
reached
the
positions
so
individually
set
out
in
wrong
with
the
but
this
can
only
remain
a
theoretical
question
for
belloc
did
actually
at
this
date
answer
the
sociological
question
that
chesterton
at
this
date
was
putting
answered
it
brilliantly
and
answered
it
truly
every
test
that
could
later
apply
of
profound
human
reality
of
truth
divinely
revealed
convinced
him
that
the
answer
was
true
he
had
he
has
told
us
been
a
socialist
because
it
was
so
horrible
not
to
be
one
but
he
now
learned
of
the
historical
christian
alternative
equally
opposed
to
socialism
and
to
capitalism
property
this
had
worked
in
the
past
was
still
working
in
many
european
countries
could
be
made
to
work
again
in
england
the
present
trend
appeared
to
belloc
to
be
towards
the
servile
state
and
in
the
book
with
this
title
and
a
second
book
restoration
of
he
later
developed
his
sociology
after
this
first
meeting
two
powerful
and
very
different
minds
would
reciprocally
influence
one
another
an
admirer
of
both
told
me
that
he
thought
chesterton
got
the
idea
of
small
property
from
belloc
but
gave
belloc
a
fuller
realization
of
the
position
of
the
family
one
difference
between
them
is
that
belloc
writes
sociology
as
a
textbook
while
chesterton
writes
it
as
a
human
document
all
the
wealth
of
imagination
that
belloc
pours
into
path
to
or
four
he
sternly
excludes
from
the
servile
state
the
poet
traveller
essayist
is
one
man
the
sociologist
another
the
third
field
of
influence
was
history
here
belloc
did
chesterton
two
great
services
he
restored
the
proportion
of
english
history
and
he
put
england
back
into
its
context
since
the
reformation
english
history
had
been
written
with
all
the
stress
on
the
protestant
period
lingard
had
written
earlier
but
had
not
been
popularized
and
certainly
would
not
be
used
at
paul
school
and
even
lingard
had
laid
little
stress
on
the
social
effects
of
the
reformation
hammond
contemporary
work
on
english
social
history
fitted
into
belloc
more
vivid
if
less
documented
vision
none
of
this
could
be
disregarded
by
later
writers
belloc
too
restored
that
earlier
england
to
the
christendom
to
which
it
belonged
the
england
of
macaulay
or
of
green
had
like
mantalini
dowager
either
no
outline
or
a
demned
outline
for
it
was
cut
out
of
a
larger
map
and
chesterton
was
always
seeking
an
outline
of
history
to
get
england
back
into
the
context
of
christendom
is
a
great
thing
just
how
great
must
depend
upon
how
rightly
christendom
is
conceived
one
can
not
always
escape
the
feeling
that
belloc
conceives
it
too
narrowly
his
famous
phrase
the
faith
is
europe
and
europe
is
the
faith
omits
too
much
the
east
out
of
which
christianity
came
the
new
worlds
into
which
europe
has
flowed
belloc
of
course
knows
these
things
and
has
often
said
them
it
is
rather
a
question
of
emphasis
of
how
things
loom
in
the
mind
when
judgments
have
to
be
made
in
that
sense
he
does
tend
to
narrow
the
faith
to
europe
in
exactly
the
same
sense
he
does
tend
to
narrow
europe
to
france
born
in
france
of
a
french
father
educated
in
england
belloc
chose
his
nationality
chose
to
be
english
but
his
creator
had
chosen
differently
and
there
is
not
much
a
man
can
do
in
competition
with
his
creator
i
do
not
for
a
moment
suggest
that
belloc
having
chosen
to
be
english
is
conscious
of
anything
but
loyalty
to
the
country
of
his
adoption
the
thing
lies
far
below
the
mind
conscious
movements
belloc
thinks
of
himself
as
an
englishman
with
a
patriotic
duty
to
criticise
his
country
but
his
feelings
are
not
really
those
of
an
englishman
once
at
least
he
recognised
this
when
he
wrote
the
verse
england
to
me
that
never
have
malingered
nor
spoken
falsely
nor
your
flattery
used
even
in
my
rightful
garden
what
have
you
not
refused
italics
mine
and
just
as
france
was
belloc
rightful
garden
so
england
was
chesterton
when
first
they
talked
of
the
church
he
told
belloc
that
he
wanted
the
example
of
someone
entirely
english
who
should
none
the
less
have
come
in
when
criticising
his
country
his
voice
has
the
note
of
pain
that
only
love
can
give
belloc
saw
him
as
intensely
national
english
of
the
english
a
mirror
of
england
he
writes
with
an
english
accent
it
is
of
some
interest
that
after
meeting
belloc
gilbert
added
notes
to
two
early
poems
each
note
reflecting
a
judgment
of
belloc
on
the
dreyfus
case
which
belloc
saw
as
all
french
catholics
saw
it
on
relations
which
belloc
saw
as
most
latin
europeans
would
see
it
the
first
was
the
poem
entitled
to
a
certain
nation
addressed
to
france
in
commentary
on
the
dreyfus
case
of
which
must
be
briefly
explained
for
those
who
are
too
young
to
remember
the
excitement
it
caused
captain
dreyfus
a
jewish
officer
in
the
french
army
had
been
found
guilty
of
treachery
and
sent
to
devil
island
all
france
was
divided
into
two
camps
on
the
question
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
in
general
catholics
and
what
we
should
call
the
right
were
all
for
his
guilt
atheists
and
believers
in
the
republic
were
for
his
innocence
passions
were
roused
to
fury
on
both
sides
english
opinion
was
almost
entirely
for
his
innocence
i
was
a
small
girl
at
the
time
and
i
remember
that
my
brother
and
i
amused
ourselves
by
crying
on
all
possible
and
impossible
occasions
for
the
annoyance
of
our
pious
french
governess
i
remember
also
that
our
parents
were
startled
by
the
vehemence
of
the
french
catholic
paper
from
which
our
governess
imbibed
her
views
ultimately
the
case
was
reopened
and
dreyfus
after
years
of
horror
on
devil
island
found
not
guilty
and
restored
to
his
rank
in
the
army
but
there
are
i
know
catholic
frenchmen
alive
today
who
refuse
to
believe
in
his
innocence
and
hold
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
plot
that
hampered
the
french
espionage
service
and
nearly
lost
us
the
war
of
in
the
first
edition
of
wild
written
before
the
meeting
with
belloc
gilbert
like
any
other
english
liberal
had
assumed
dreyfus
innocence
and
in
the
poem
to
a
certain
nation
had
reproached
the
france
of
the
revolution
the
france
he
had
loved
as
unworthy
of
herself
and
we
who
knew
thee
once
we
have
a
right
to
weep
the
note
in
the
second
edition
shows
him
as
now
undecided
about
dreyfus
guilt
and
concludes
there
may
have
been
a
fog
of
injustice
in
the
french
courts
i
know
that
there
was
a
fog
of
injustice
in
the
english
newspapers
in
an
alliance
chesterton
had
gloried
in
the
blood
of
hengist
and
hymned
an
alliance
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
young
republican
who
took
for
granted
the
links
of
language
and
of
origin
that
might
draw
together
two
great
countries
into
something
significant
in
change
eclipse
and
peril
under
the
whole
world
scorn
by
blood
and
death
and
darkness
the
saxon
peace
is
sworn
that
all
our
fruit
be
gathered
and
all
our
race
take
hands
and
the
sea
be
a
saxon
river
that
runs
through
saxon
lands
but
in
the
note
to
the
second
edition
he
says
in
the
matter
of
the
alliance
i
have
come
to
see
that
our
hopes
of
brotherhood
with
america
are
the
same
in
kind
as
our
hopes
of
brotherhood
with
any
other
of
the
great
independent
nations
of
christendom
and
a
very
small
study
of
history
was
sufficient
to
show
me
that
the
american
nation
which
is
a
hundred
years
old
is
at
least
fifty
years
older
than
the
race
collected
poems
p
the
poem
was
of
course
only
a
boyish
expression
of
a
boyish
dream
like
all
dreams
like
all
boyhood
dreams
especially
it
omitted
too
much
yet
it
contained
a
thought
that
might
well
have
borne
rich
fruit
in
gilbert
catholic
life
my
mother
told
me
once
that
when
after
three
years
study
of
queen
elizabeth
character
she
came
to
a
different
conclusion
from
belloc
she
found
it
almost
impossible
to
resist
his
power
and
hold
on
to
her
own
view
it
must
be
realised
that
chesterton
actually
preferred
the
attitude
of
a
disciple
a
mutual
friend
has
told
me
that
chesterton
listened
to
belloc
all
the
time
and
said
very
little
himself
in
matters
historical
where
he
felt
his
own
ignorance
tendency
was
simply
to
make
an
act
of
faith
in
belloc
on
nothing
were
the
two
men
more
healthily
in
accord
than
on
the
boer
war
in
an
interesting
study
of
belloc
prefixed
to
a
french
translation
of
eccles
explains
how
he
and
most
of
the
group
differed
from
the
pacifist
who
hated
the
south
african
war
because
they
hated
all
wars
the
young
liberals
on
the
were
not
pacifists
they
hated
the
war
because
they
thought
it
would
harm
england
harm
her
morally
to
be
fighting
for
an
unjust
cause
and
even
materially
to
be
shedding
the
blood
of
her
sons
and
pouring
out
her
wealth
at
the
bidding
of
a
handful
of
alien
financiers
thus
far
gilbert
was
among
one
group
with
whom
he
was
in
fullest
sympathy
but
i
think
he
went
further
eccles
told
me
that
most
of
the
group
had
no
sympathy
with
the
boers
gilbert
had
he
thought
of
them
as
human
beings
who
might
well
have
been
farmers
of
sussex
or
of
kent
something
of
an
older
civilization
resisting
money
power
and
imperialism
and
perishing
thereby
few
indeed
of
the
liberal
party
held
chesterton
ideal
an
england
territorially
small
spiritually
great
the
was
struggling
against
odds
it
was
the
voice
of
a
tiny
group
to
gilbert
it
seemed
that
this
mattered
nothing
so
long
as
that
little
group
held
to
their
great
ideas
so
long
as
the
paper
represented
not
merely
a
group
or
a
party
but
the
liberal
idea
in
an
unfinished
letter
to
hammond
is
to
be
found
this
idea
as
he
saw
it
and
his
dawning
disappointment
even
with
the
paper
that
most
nearly
stood
for
it
i
am
just
about
to
commit
a
serious
impertinence
i
believe
however
that
you
will
excuse
it
because
it
is
about
the
paper
and
i
know
there
is
not
another
paper
dead
or
alive
for
which
i
would
take
the
trouble
or
run
the
risk
of
offence
i
am
hearing
on
all
sides
the
complained
of
by
the
very
people
who
should
be
and
would
be
if
they
could
its
enthusiastic
supporters
and
i
can
not
altogether
deny
the
truth
of
their
objections
though
i
am
glad
to
notice
both
in
them
and
in
myself
the
fact
that
those
objections
are
tacitly
based
on
the
assumption
of
the
having
an
aim
and
standard
higher
than
other
papers
if
the
were
a
mere
party
rag
like
judy
or
the
times
it
would
be
only
remarkable
for
moderation
but
to
us
who
have
built
hopes
on
it
as
the
pioneer
of
a
younger
and
larger
political
spirit
it
is
difficult
to
be
silent
when
we
find
it
as
it
seems
to
us
poisoned
with
that
spirit
of
ferocious
triviality
which
is
the
spirit
of
birmingham
eloquence
and
with
that
evil
instinct
which
has
disintegrated
the
irish
party
the
instinct
for
hating
the
man
who
differs
from
you
slightly
more
than
the
man
who
differs
from
you
altogether
of
two
successive
numbers
during
the
stress
of
the
fight
a
fight
in
which
we
had
first
to
unite
our
army
and
then
to
use
it
a
considerable
portion
was
devoted
first
to
sneering
at
the
daily
news
and
then
to
sneering
at
the
westminster
gazette
there
is
a
sentence
in
the
book
of
proverbs
which
expresses
the
whole
of
my
politics
for
the
liberal
man
deviseth
liberal
things
and
by
his
liberality
he
shall
stand
now
what
i
object
to
is
sneering
at
the
westminster
as
a
supporter
of
chamberlain
when
everyone
knows
that
it
hardly
lets
a
day
pass
without
an
ugly
caricature
of
him
what
i
object
to
in
this
is
that
it
is
talking
brummagem
it
is
not
devising
liberal
things
but
spiteful
superficial
illiberal
things
it
is
claptrap
and
temporary
deception
of
the
patriotism
before
politics
order
to
all
this
you
will
say
there
is
an
obvious
answer
the
is
a
party
paper
and
does
not
profess
to
be
otherwise
but
here
i
am
sure
we
are
mistaking
our
mission
what
the
is
i
hope
and
believe
destined
to
do
is
to
renovate
liberalism
and
though
liberalism
like
every
other
party
is
often
conducted
by
claptrap
it
has
never
been
renovated
by
claptrap
but
by
great
command
of
temper
and
the
persistent
exposition
of
persuasive
and
unanswerable
truths
it
is
while
we
are
in
the
desert
that
we
have
the
vision
we
being
a
minority
must
be
all
philosophers
we
must
think
for
both
parties
in
the
state
it
is
no
good
our
devoting
ourselves
to
the
flowers
of
mob
oratory
with
no
mob
to
address
them
to
we
must
like
the
free
traders
for
instance
have
discoveries
definite
truths
and
endless
patience
in
explaining
them
we
must
be
more
than
a
political
party
or
we
shall
cease
to
be
one
time
and
again
in
history
victory
has
come
to
a
little
party
with
big
ideas
but
can
anyone
conceive
anything
with
the
mark
of
death
more
on
its
brow
than
a
little
party
with
little
ideas
undated
handwritten
letter
in
a
notebook
such
liberalism
was
not
perhaps
of
this
world
it
certainly
was
not
of
the
liberal
party
gilbert
argued
much
with
himself
during
these
years
he
had
come
out
of
his
time
of
trial
with
firm
faith
in
god
and
in
man
but
his
philosophy
was
still
in
the
making
and
he
made
it
largely
out
of
the
material
supplied
by
ordinary
london
suburban
society
and
by
the
rather
less
usual
society
of
cranks
and
enthusiasts
so
plentiful
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
has
written
in
the
of
the
artistic
and
dilettante
groups
where
everyone
discussed
religion
and
no
one
practised
it
of
the
christian
socialists
and
other
societies
into
which
he
and
cecil
found
their
way
and
of
some
of
the
friendships
they
formed
among
these
one
of
the
closest
was
with
conrad
noel
who
wrote
in
answer
to
my
request
for
his
recollections
we
met
for
the
first
time
at
the
stapleys
in
bloomsbury
square
at
a
series
of
meetings
of
the
society
he
was
like
a
very
big
fish
out
of
water
he
was
comparatively
thin
however
in
those
days
nearly
forty
years
ago
we
had
been
much
intrigued
by
the
weekly
contribution
of
an
unknown
writer
to
the
speaker
and
the
nation
brilliant
work
and
my
wife
and
i
independently
came
to
the
conclusion
when
we
heard
this
young
man
speak
that
it
must
be
he
the
style
was
unmistakable
i
thought
of
writing
to
him
to
congratulate
him
on
his
speech
but
before
i
could
do
so
i
got
a
letter
from
him
saying
that
he
was
coming
to
hear
me
in
the
same
series
in
a
week
or
so
it
was
thus
we
first
became
acquainted
and
the
acquaintance
ripened
into
a
warm
friendship
with
us
both
he
and
his
brother
cecil
were
in
and
out
of
our
flat
in
paddington
green
where
i
was
assistant
curate
he
was
genial
bubbling
over
with
jokes
at
which
he
roared
with
laughter
the
question
was
becoming
insistent
when
would
there
be
enough
money
for
frances
and
gilbert
to
get
married
in
one
letter
frances
asks
him
what
he
thinks
of
omar
khayyam
he
replies
at
great
length
and
concludes
you
see
the
result
of
asking
me
for
an
opinion
i
have
written
it
very
hurriedly
if
i
had
paused
i
might
make
an
essay
of
it
commercial
pig
never
mind
sweetheart
that
essay
might
be
a
some
day
or
at
any
rate
a
cheap
of
his
belief
in
god
in
man
in
goodness
as
against
the
pessimist
outlook
of
the
day
gilbert
as
we
have
seen
felt
profound
certitude
that
his
outlook
was
one
that
held
him
back
from
many
fields
of
opportunity
he
was
already
partly
conscious
a
fragment
of
a
letter
to
frances
expresses
this
feeling
i
find
i
can
not
possibly
come
tonight
as
my
canadian
uncle
keeps
his
last
night
in
england
in
a
sort
of
family
party
and
i
abide
by
my
father
house
said
our
lady
of
the
snows
i
have
just
had
a
note
from
rex
asking
me
with
characteristic
precision
if
i
can
produce
a
play
in
the
style
of
maeterlinck
by
this
afternoon
or
words
to
that
effect
the
idea
is
full
of
humour
he
remarks
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
is
just
a
remote
chance
of
his
getting
the
stage
society
to
act
my
play
of
the
wild
knight
this
opens
to
me
a
vista
of
quite
new
ambition
why
only
at
the
stage
society
i
see
a
visionary
programme
the
wild
knight
charles
hawtree
captain
redfeather
penley
olive
miss
katie
seymour
priest
sir
henry
irving
lord
orm
arthur
roberts
i
am
working
and
must
get
on
with
my
work
i
do
not
feel
any
despondency
about
it
because
i
know
it
is
good
and
worth
doing
it
is
extraordinary
how
much
more
moral
one
is
than
one
imagines
at
school
i
never
minded
getting
into
a
row
if
it
were
not
my
fault
similarly
i
have
never
cared
a
rap
for
rejections
or
criticisms
since
i
had
got
a
point
of
view
to
express
which
i
was
certain
held
water
some
people
think
it
holds
water
on
the
brain
but
i
mind
bless
them
i
am
afraid
darling
that
this
doctrine
of
patience
is
hard
on
you
but
really
it
a
grand
thing
to
think
oneself
right
it
what
this
whole
age
is
starving
for
something
to
suffer
for
and
go
mad
and
miserable
over
that
is
the
only
luxury
of
the
mind
i
wish
i
were
a
convinced
and
could
stare
down
a
howling
mob
but
i
right
about
the
cosmos
and
schopenhauer
and
are
wrong
two
interesting
points
in
this
letter
are
the
remark
about
wishing
to
be
a
convinced
which
he
certainly
became
and
the
suggestion
of
a
possible
performance
of
wild
perhaps
the
letter
was
written
before
he
had
finally
taken
his
stand
it
has
no
dating
postmark
or
perhaps
it
merely
means
that
his
convictions
on
the
cosmos
are
more
absolute
than
on
the
war
as
to
wild
knight
it
was
never
acted
and
its
publication
was
made
possible
only
by
the
generosity
of
gilbert
father
for
a
volume
of
comic
verse
at
which
appeared
earlier
in
the
same
year
he
could
find
a
publisher
but
serious
poetry
has
never
been
easy
to
launch
the
letter
that
follows
has
a
more
immediate
bearing
on
their
own
future
warwick
gardens
good
friday
as
you
have
tabulated
your
questions
with
such
alarming
precision
i
must
really
endeavour
to
answer
them
categorically
how
am
i
i
am
in
excellent
health
i
have
an
opaque
cold
in
my
head
cough
tempestuously
and
am
very
deaf
but
these
things
i
count
as
mere
specks
showing
up
the
general
blaze
of
salubrity
i
am
getting
steadily
better
and
i
do
mind
how
slowly
as
for
my
spirits
a
cold
never
affects
them
for
i
have
plenty
to
do
and
think
about
indoors
one
or
two
little
literary
schemes
trifles
doubtless
claim
my
attention
am
i
going
away
at
easter
the
sarcastic
might
think
it
a
characteristic
answer
but
i
can
only
reply
that
i
had
banished
the
matter
from
my
mind
a
vague
problem
of
the
remote
future
until
you
asked
it
but
since
this
is
easter
and
we
are
not
gone
away
i
suppose
we
are
not
going
away
i
will
meet
you
at
euston
on
tuesday
evening
though
hell
itself
should
gape
and
bid
me
stop
at
home
i
am
not
sure
whether
a
review
on
crivelli
art
is
out
this
week
i
am
going
to
look
alas
i
have
not
been
to
nutt
there
are
good
excuses
but
they
are
not
the
real
ones
i
will
write
to
him
now
yes
now
does
my
hair
want
cutting
my
hair
seems
pretty
happy
you
are
the
only
person
who
seems
to
have
any
fixed
theory
on
this
for
all
i
know
it
may
be
at
that
fugitive
perfection
which
has
moved
you
to
enthusiasm
three
minutes
after
this
perfection
i
understand
a
horrible
degeneration
sets
in
the
hair
becomes
too
long
the
figure
disreputable
and
profligate
and
the
individual
is
unrecognised
by
all
his
friends
it
is
he
that
wants
cutting
then
not
his
hair
as
to
studs
and
laces
i
glitter
from
head
to
foot
with
them
i
have
had
a
few
skirmishes
with
knollys
but
not
the
general
engagement
when
this
comes
off
you
shall
have
news
from
our
correspondent
knollys
was
frances
brother
i
have
got
a
really
important
job
in
reviewing
the
life
of
ruskin
for
the
as
i
have
precisely
theories
about
ruskin
it
will
be
brilliant
and
condensed
i
am
also
reviewing
the
life
of
the
kendals
a
book
on
the
renascence
and
one
on
correggio
for
the
bookman
how
far
is
it
to
babylon
babylon
i
am
firmly
convinced
is
just
round
the
corner
if
one
could
be
only
certain
which
corner
this
conviction
is
the
salt
of
my
life
really
and
truly
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
married
in
april
if
not
before
i
have
been
making
some
money
calculations
with
the
kind
assistance
of
rex
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
could
live
in
the
country
on
quite
a
small
amount
of
regular
literary
work
forgot
the
last
question
oddly
enough
i
was
writing
a
poem
will
send
it
to
you
gilbert
engagement
had
given
him
the
impetus
to
earn
more
but
he
was
always
entirely
unpractical
his
salary
at
fisher
unwin
had
been
negligible
and
he
was
not
making
much
yet
by
the
journalism
which
was
now
his
only
source
of
income
the
repeated
promise
to
write
to
nutt
is
very
characteristic
for
nutt
was
the
manager
of
the
solitary
publisher
who
was
at
the
moment
prepared
to
put
a
book
of
gilbert
on
the
market
at
his
own
risk
although
they
did
not
manage
to
get
married
this
year
by
the
end
of
it
he
was
becoming
well
known
the
articles
in
the
especially
were
attracting
attention
and
at
had
a
considerable
success
this
the
first
of
gilbert
books
to
be
published
is
a
curiosity
it
is
made
up
of
three
incredibly
witty
satirical
poems
the
oneness
of
the
philosopher
with
nature
the
dangers
attending
altruism
on
the
high
seas
and
the
disastrous
spread
of
aestheticism
in
all
classes
the
illustrations
drawn
by
himself
are
as
witty
as
the
verses
by
the
beginning
of
his
work
was
being
sought
for
by
other
liberal
periodicals
and
he
was
writing
regularly
for
the
the
following
letter
to
frances
bears
the
postmark
somewhere
in
the
arabian
nights
or
some
such
place
there
is
a
story
of
a
man
who
was
emperor
of
the
indies
for
one
day
i
am
rather
in
the
position
of
that
person
for
i
am
editor
of
the
for
one
day
hammond
is
unwell
and
hirst
has
gone
to
dine
with
john
morley
so
the
latter
asked
me
to
see
the
paper
through
for
this
number
hence
this
notepaper
and
the
great
hurry
and
brevity
which
i
fear
must
characterise
this
letter
there
are
a
few
minor
amusing
things
however
that
i
have
a
moment
to
mention
the
daily
news
have
sent
me
a
huge
mass
of
books
to
review
which
block
up
the
front
hall
a
study
of
swinburne
a
book
on
kipling
the
last
richard
le
gallienne
all
very
interesting
see
if
i
do
do
some
whacking
articles
all
about
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
the
creation
of
adam
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
really
think
i
could
work
a
revolution
in
daily
paper
writing
by
the
introduction
of
poetical
prose
among
other
books
that
i
have
to
review
came
all
unsolicited
a
book
by
your
old
friend
schofield
ha
ha
ha
it
about
the
formation
of
character
or
some
of
those
low
and
beastly
amusements
i
think
of
introducing
parts
of
my
comic
opera
of
the
into
the
articles
another
rather
funny
thing
is
the
way
in
which
my
name
is
being
spread
about
belloc
declares
that
everyone
says
to
him
who
discovered
chesterton
and
that
he
always
replies
the
genius
oldershaw
this
may
be
a
trifle
gallic
but
hammond
has
shown
me
more
than
one
letter
from
cambridge
dons
and
such
people
demanding
the
identity
of
in
a
quite
violent
tone
they
excuse
themselves
by
offensive
phrases
in
which
the
word
brilliant
occurs
but
i
should
wonder
if
there
was
a
thick
stick
somewhere
at
the
back
of
it
belloc
by
the
way
has
revealed
another
side
of
his
extraordinary
mind
he
seems
to
have
taken
our
marriage
much
to
heart
for
he
talks
to
me
no
longer
about
french
jacobins
and
mediaeval
saints
but
entirely
about
the
cheapest
flats
and
furniture
on
which
as
on
the
others
he
is
a
mine
of
information
assuring
me
paternally
that
it
the
carpet
that
does
you
i
should
think
this
fatherly
tone
would
amuse
you
now
i
must
leave
off
for
the
pages
have
come
up
to
be
seen
through
the
press
at
its
author
never
took
very
seriously
it
was
not
included
in
his
collected
poems
and
he
does
not
even
mention
it
in
his
he
attached
a
great
deal
more
importance
to
wild
knight
and
other
it
was
a
volume
of
some
fifty
poems
many
of
which
had
already
appeared
in
and
it
was
published
late
in
and
produced
a
crop
of
enthusiastic
reviews
and
more
and
more
people
began
to
ask
one
another
who
is
k
chesterton
one
reviewer
wrote
if
it
were
not
for
the
haunting
fear
of
losing
a
humourist
we
should
welcome
the
author
of
wild
to
a
high
place
among
the
poets
another
spoke
of
the
curious
intensity
of
the
volume
among
those
who
were
less
pleased
was
john
davidson
on
whom
the
book
had
been
fathered
by
one
reviewer
and
who
denied
responsibility
for
such
frantic
rubbish
and
also
a
reverent
reviewer
who
complained
it
is
scattered
all
over
with
the
name
of
god
to
frances
gilbert
wrote
i
have
been
taken
to
see
meynell
poet
and
essayist
who
is
enthusiastic
about
the
wild
knight
and
is
lending
it
to
all
her
friends
last
night
i
went
to
cox
book
party
my
costume
was
a
great
success
everyone
wrestled
with
it
only
one
person
guessed
it
and
the
rest
admitted
that
it
was
quite
fair
and
simple
it
consisted
of
wearing
on
the
lapel
of
my
dress
coat
the
following
letters
perhaps
you
would
like
to
work
this
out
all
by
yourself
but
no
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
the
book
i
represented
was
the
letters
of
junius
meynell
never
came
to
know
gilbert
well
and
her
daughter
says
in
the
biography
that
her
mother
realised
his
critical
approval
admiration
would
be
a
better
word
of
her
own
work
only
by
reading
his
essays
but
he
once
wrote
an
introduction
for
a
book
of
hers
and
her
admiration
of
him
would
break
out
frequently
in
amusing
exclamations
i
hope
the
papers
are
nice
to
my
chesterton
he
is
mine
much
more
really
than
belloc
if
i
had
been
a
man
and
large
i
should
have
been
chesterton
p
p
brimley
johnson
who
was
to
have
been
gilbert
sent
wild
to
rudyard
kipling
his
reply
is
amusing
and
also
touching
for
johnson
was
clearly
pouring
out
in
interest
in
gilbert
career
and
in
forwarding
his
marriage
with
frances
the
affections
that
might
merely
have
been
frozen
by
gertrude
death
the
elms
rottingdean
dear
johnson
many
thanks
for
wild
of
course
i
knew
some
of
the
poems
before
notably
which
stuck
in
my
mind
at
the
time
i
read
it
i
agree
with
you
that
there
is
any
amount
of
promise
in
the
work
and
i
think
marriage
will
teach
him
a
good
deal
too
it
will
be
curious
to
see
how
he
develop
in
a
few
years
we
all
begin
with
arrainging
sic
and
elaborating
all
the
heavens
and
hells
and
stars
and
tragedies
we
can
lay
our
poetic
hands
on
later
we
see
folk
just
common
people
under
the
heavens
meantime
i
wish
him
all
the
happiness
that
there
can
be
and
for
yourself
such
comfort
as
men
say
time
brings
after
loss
it
apt
to
be
a
weary
while
coming
but
one
goes
the
right
way
to
get
it
if
one
interests
oneself
in
the
happiness
of
other
folk
even
though
the
sight
of
this
happiness
is
like
a
knife
turning
in
a
wound
yours
sincerely
rudyard
kipling
merely
as
a
matter
of
loathsome
detail
chesterton
has
a
bad
attack
of
aureoles
they
are
spotted
all
over
the
book
i
think
every
one
is
bound
in
each
book
to
employ
unconsciously
some
pet
word
but
that
was
rossetti
likewise
i
notice
wan
waste
and
many
wans
and
things
that
catch
and
cling
he
is
too
good
not
to
be
jolted
out
of
that
what
do
you
say
to
a
severe
course
of
walt
whitman
or
will
marriage
make
him
see
people
gilbert
had
already
taken
both
prescriptions
walt
whitman
and
folk
just
common
people
under
the
heavens
many
years
later
james
agate
wrote
in
and
unlike
some
other
serious
thinkers
chesterton
understood
his
fellow
men
the
woes
of
a
jockey
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
the
worries
of
a
judge
perhaps
some
slight
echoes
of
swinburne
did
remain
in
this
collection
many
earlier
poems
exist
in
the
swinburne
manner
not
of
thought
but
of
expression
gilbert
left
an
absolute
command
that
these
should
never
be
published
all
englishmen
were
stricken
by
the
death
of
queen
victoria
somers
cocks
who
had
come
to
know
gilbert
through
his
intimacy
with
belloc
remembers
that
he
wept
when
he
heard
of
it
the
tears
may
almost
be
heard
in
a
letter
to
frances
today
the
queen
was
buried
i
did
not
see
the
procession
first
because
i
had
an
appointment
with
hammond
of
which
more
anon
and
secondly
because
i
think
i
felt
the
matter
too
genuinely
i
like
a
crowd
when
i
am
triumphant
or
excited
for
a
crowd
is
the
only
thing
that
can
cheer
as
much
as
a
cock
is
the
only
thing
that
can
crow
can
anything
be
more
absurd
than
the
idea
of
a
man
cheering
alone
in
his
back
bedroom
but
i
think
that
reverence
is
better
expressed
by
one
man
than
a
million
there
is
something
unnatural
and
impossible
even
grotesque
in
the
idea
of
a
vast
crowd
of
human
beings
all
assuming
an
air
of
delicacy
all
the
same
my
dear
this
is
a
great
and
serious
hour
and
it
is
felt
so
completely
by
all
england
that
i
can
not
deny
the
enduring
wish
i
have
quite
apart
from
certain
more
private
sentiments
that
the
noblest
englishwoman
i
have
ever
known
was
here
with
me
to
renew
as
i
do
private
vows
of
a
very
real
character
to
do
my
best
for
this
country
of
mine
which
i
love
with
a
love
passing
the
love
of
jingoes
it
is
sometimes
easy
to
give
country
blood
and
easier
to
give
her
money
sometimes
the
hardest
thing
of
all
is
to
give
her
truth
i
am
writing
an
article
on
the
good
friend
who
is
dead
i
hope
particularly
that
you
will
like
it
the
one
i
really
like
so
far
is
belloc
in
the
speaker
i
had
as
i
said
many
things
to
say
but
owing
to
the
hour
and
a
certain
fatigue
and
idiocy
in
myself
i
have
only
space
for
the
most
important
hammond
sent
for
me
today
and
asked
me
seriously
if
i
would
help
him
in
writing
a
book
on
fox
sharing
work
fame
and
profits
i
told
him
that
i
had
no
special
talent
for
research
he
replied
that
he
had
no
talent
for
literary
form
i
then
said
that
i
would
be
delighted
to
give
him
such
assistance
as
i
honestly
thought
valuable
enough
for
him
to
split
his
profits
for
that
i
thought
i
could
give
him
such
assistance
in
the
matter
of
picturesqueness
and
plan
of
idea
more
especially
as
fox
was
a
great
hero
of
mine
and
the
philosophy
of
his
life
involves
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
revolution
and
of
the
love
of
mankind
we
arranged
that
we
would
make
a
preliminary
examination
of
the
fox
record
and
then
decide
this
book
was
never
written
nor
even
i
think
begun
three
more
letters
two
to
frances
one
to
his
mother
complete
the
outline
of
this
eventful
period
he
was
now
determined
to
get
married
quickly
for
the
first
time
and
entirely
without
rancour
he
realised
the
inevitable
competition
in
the
world
of
journalism
the
struggle
for
success
meant
men
fighting
one
another
other
journalists
were
fighting
him
but
truly
enough
though
with
a
rare
dispassionateness
he
realised
that
this
meant
a
need
for
daily
bread
in
others
similar
to
his
own
warwick
gardens
postmark
i
hope
that
in
your
own
beautiful
kindness
you
will
be
indulgent
just
at
this
time
if
i
only
write
rough
letters
or
postcards
i
am
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
thoroughly
and
i
find
it
a
rather
exciting
and
not
entirely
unpleasant
sensation
but
everything
depends
just
now
not
only
on
my
sticking
hard
to
work
and
doing
a
lot
of
my
very
best
but
on
my
thinking
about
it
keeping
wide
awake
to
the
turn
of
the
market
being
ready
to
do
things
not
in
half
a
week
but
in
half
an
hour
getting
the
feelings
and
tendencies
of
other
men
and
generally
living
in
work
i
am
going
to
see
lehmann
tomorrow
and
many
things
may
come
of
it
i
can
not
express
to
you
what
it
is
to
feel
the
grip
of
the
great
wheel
of
real
life
on
you
for
the
first
time
for
the
first
time
i
know
what
is
meant
by
the
word
enemies
men
who
deliberately
dislike
you
and
oppose
your
career
and
the
funny
thing
is
that
i
do
dislike
them
at
all
myself
poor
devils
very
likely
they
want
to
be
married
in
june
too
i
am
a
socialist
but
i
love
this
fierce
old
world
and
am
beginning
to
find
a
beauty
in
making
money
in
moderation
as
in
making
statues
always
through
my
head
one
tune
and
words
of
kipling
set
to
it
they
passed
one
resolution
your
believe
you
can
lighten
the
curse
of
adam
when
you
lightened
the
curse
of
eve
and
till
we
are
built
like
angels
with
hammer
and
chisel
and
pen
we
work
for
ourselves
and
a
woman
for
ever
and
ever
amen
warwick
gardens
postmark
march
i
have
delayed
this
letter
in
a
scandalous
manner
because
i
hoped
i
might
have
the
arrangements
with
the
to
tell
you
as
that
is
again
put
off
i
must
tell
you
later
the
following
however
are
grounds
on
which
i
believe
everything
will
turn
out
right
this
year
it
is
arithmetic
the
speaker
has
hitherto
paid
me
a
year
that
is
a
month
it
has
now
raised
it
to
a
month
which
makes
a
year
moreover
they
encourage
me
to
write
as
much
as
i
like
in
the
paper
so
that
assuming
that
i
do
something
extra
poem
note
leader
twice
a
month
or
every
other
number
which
i
can
easily
do
that
brings
us
to
nearly
a
year
so
much
for
the
speaker
now
for
the
daily
news
both
certainties
and
probabilities
hammond
to
whom
you
will
favour
me
by
being
eternally
grateful
pushed
me
so
strongly
with
lehmann
for
the
post
of
manager
of
the
literary
page
that
it
is
most
probable
that
i
shall
get
it
if
i
do
hammond
thinks
they
could
give
me
less
than
a
year
so
that
if
this
turns
out
right
we
have
say
without
any
aid
from
bookman
books
magazine
articles
or
stories
let
us
however
put
this
chance
entirely
on
one
side
and
suppose
that
they
can
give
me
nothing
but
regular
work
on
the
daily
news
i
have
just
started
a
set
of
popular
fighting
articles
on
literature
in
the
daily
news
called
the
wars
of
literature
they
will
appear
at
least
twice
a
week
often
three
times
for
each
of
these
i
am
paid
about
a
guinea
and
a
half
this
makes
about
a
week
which
is
a
year
thus
with
only
the
present
certainties
of
speaker
and
daily
news
we
have
a
year
or
very
likely
with
extra
speaker
items
close
on
this
again
may
be
reinforced
by
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
work
which
i
shall
get
now
my
name
is
getting
known
magazine
articles
helping
editors
or
publishers
reading
mss
and
so
on
in
all
these
calculations
i
have
kept
deliberately
under
the
figures
not
over
them
so
that
i
do
think
i
have
failed
altogether
to
bring
my
promise
within
reasonable
distance
of
fact
already
belloc
suggested
that
i
should
write
for
the
pilot
and
as
he
is
on
it
he
will
probably
get
me
some
work
hammond
has
become
on
the
echo
and
will
probably
get
me
some
reviewing
on
that
and
between
ourselves
to
turn
with
intense
relief
from
all
this
egotism
hammond
and
i
have
a
little
scheme
on
hand
for
getting
oldershaw
a
kind
of
editorial
place
on
the
echo
where
they
want
a
brisk
but
cultivated
man
of
the
world
i
think
we
can
bring
it
off
it
is
a
good
place
for
an
ambitious
young
man
it
would
give
me
more
happiness
than
i
can
say
while
i
am
building
my
own
house
of
peace
to
do
something
for
the
man
who
did
so
much
in
giving
me
my
reason
for
it
for
well
thou
knowest
o
god
most
wise
how
good
on
earth
was
his
gift
to
me
shall
this
be
a
little
thing
in
thine
eyes
that
is
greater
in
mine
than
the
whole
great
sea
i
am
afraid
that
this
is
a
very
dull
letter
but
you
know
what
i
am
i
can
be
practical
but
only
deliberately
by
fixing
my
mind
on
a
thing
in
this
letter
i
sum
up
my
last
month
thinking
about
money
resources
i
have
given
a
thought
yet
to
the
application
and
distribution
of
them
in
rent
furniture
etc
when
i
have
done
thinking
about
that
you
will
get
another
dull
letter
i
can
keep
ten
poems
and
twenty
theories
in
my
head
at
once
but
i
can
only
think
of
one
practical
thing
at
a
time
the
only
conclusion
of
this
letter
is
that
on
any
calculation
whatever
we
ought
to
have
a
year
and
be
on
the
road
to
four
in
a
little
while
with
this
before
you
i
daresay
you
who
are
more
practical
than
i
could
speculate
and
suggest
a
little
as
to
the
form
of
living
and
expenditure
gilbert
mother
perhaps
needed
more
convincing
the
letter
to
her
has
no
postmark
but
the
a
year
has
grown
to
almost
and
a
careful
economy
is
promised
barnes
the
orchards
burley
hants
my
dearest
mother
thank
you
very
much
for
your
two
letters
if
you
get
back
to
kensington
before
me
i
shall
return
on
thursday
night
i
find
i
work
here
very
well
would
you
mind
sending
on
any
letters
you
might
send
on
the
cheque
though
that
is
not
necessary
there
is
a
subject
we
have
touched
on
once
or
twice
that
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
for
i
am
very
much
worried
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
you
will
disapprove
of
a
decision
i
have
been
coming
to
with
a
very
earnest
belief
that
i
am
seeking
to
do
the
right
thing
i
have
just
had
information
that
my
screw
from
the
speaker
will
be
yet
further
increased
from
a
year
to
or
if
i
do
the
full
amount
i
can
a
year
i
have
also
had
a
request
from
the
daily
news
to
do
two
columns
a
week
regularly
which
is
rather
over
a
year
besides
other
book
reviews
my
other
sources
of
income
which
should
bring
the
amount
up
to
nearly
more
at
any
rate
i
will
speak
of
in
a
moment
there
is
something
as
i
say
that
is
distressing
me
a
great
deal
i
believe
i
said
about
a
year
ago
that
i
hoped
to
get
married
in
a
year
if
i
had
money
enough
i
fancy
you
took
it
rather
as
a
joke
i
was
not
so
certain
about
it
myself
then
i
have
however
been
coming
very
seriously
to
the
conclusion
that
if
i
pull
off
one
more
affair
a
favourable
arrangement
with
reynolds
newspaper
whose
editor
wants
to
see
me
at
the
end
of
this
week
i
shall
unless
you
disapprove
make
a
dash
for
it
this
year
when
i
mentioned
the
matter
a
short
time
ago
you
said
if
i
remember
right
that
you
did
not
think
i
ought
to
marry
under
or
a
year
i
was
moved
to
go
into
the
matter
thoroughly
then
and
there
but
as
it
happened
i
knew
i
had
one
or
two
bargains
just
coming
of
which
would
bring
me
nearer
to
the
standard
you
named
so
i
thought
i
would
let
it
stand
over
till
i
could
actually
quote
them
believe
me
my
dearest
mother
i
am
not
considering
this
affair
wildly
or
ignorantly
i
have
been
doing
nothing
but
sums
in
my
head
for
the
last
months
this
is
how
matters
stand
the
editor
says
they
will
take
as
much
as
i
like
to
write
if
i
write
my
maximum
i
get
a
year
from
them
from
the
even
if
i
do
not
get
the
post
on
the
staff
which
was
half
promised
me
i
shall
get
at
least
a
year
with
a
good
deal
over
for
reviews
outside
the
wars
of
literature
that
makes
nearly
with
the
manchester
sunday
chronicle
i
have
just
made
a
bargain
by
which
i
shall
get
a
year
this
makes
a
year
altogether
the
matter
now
i
think
largely
depends
on
reynolds
newspaper
if
i
do
as
is
contemplated
weekly
articles
and
thumbnail
sketches
they
can
not
give
me
less
than
a
year
this
would
bring
the
whole
to
a
year
or
within
of
your
standard
of
course
i
know
quite
well
that
this
is
not
like
talking
of
an
income
from
a
business
or
a
certain
investment
but
we
should
live
a
long
way
within
this
income
if
we
took
a
very
cheap
flat
even
a
workman
flat
if
necessary
had
a
woman
in
to
do
the
laborious
daily
work
and
for
the
rest
waited
on
ourselves
as
many
people
i
know
do
in
cheap
flats
moreover
journalism
has
its
ups
as
well
as
downs
and
i
i
can
fairly
say
am
on
the
upward
wave
without
vanity
and
in
a
purely
businesslike
spirit
i
may
say
that
my
work
is
talked
about
a
great
deal
it
is
at
least
a
remarkable
fact
that
every
one
of
the
papers
i
write
for
as
detailed
above
came
to
me
and
asked
me
to
do
work
for
them
from
the
down
to
the
manchester
sunday
chronicle
i
have
as
i
say
what
seems
to
me
a
sufficient
income
for
a
start
that
i
shall
have
as
good
and
better
i
am
as
certain
as
that
i
sit
here
i
know
the
clockwork
of
these
papers
and
among
one
set
of
them
i
might
almost
say
that
i
am
becoming
the
fashion
do
not
please
think
that
i
am
entertaining
this
idea
without
realising
that
i
shall
have
to
start
in
a
very
serious
and
economical
spirit
i
have
worked
it
out
and
i
am
sure
we
could
live
well
within
the
above
calculations
and
leave
a
good
margin
i
make
all
these
prosaic
statements
because
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
know
the
risks
i
think
of
running
but
it
is
not
any
practical
question
that
is
distressing
me
on
that
i
think
i
see
my
way
but
i
am
terribly
worried
for
fear
you
should
be
angry
or
sorry
about
all
this
i
am
only
kept
in
hope
by
the
remembrance
that
i
had
the
same
fear
when
i
told
you
of
my
engagement
and
that
you
dispelled
it
with
a
directness
and
generosity
that
i
shall
not
forget
i
think
my
dear
mother
that
we
have
always
understood
each
other
really
we
are
neither
of
us
very
demonstrative
we
come
of
some
queer
stock
that
can
always
say
least
when
it
means
most
but
i
do
think
you
can
trust
me
when
i
say
that
i
think
a
thing
really
right
and
equally
honestly
admit
that
i
can
hardly
explain
why
to
explain
why
i
know
it
is
right
would
be
to
communicate
the
incommunicable
and
speak
of
delicate
and
sacred
things
in
bald
words
the
most
i
can
say
is
that
i
know
frances
like
the
back
of
my
hand
and
can
tell
without
a
word
from
her
that
she
has
never
recovered
from
a
and
that
there
is
only
one
kind
of
peace
that
will
heal
it
gertrude
death
i
have
tried
to
explain
myself
in
this
letter
i
can
do
it
better
in
a
letter
somehow
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
done
it
very
successfully
however
with
you
it
does
not
matter
and
it
never
will
matter
how
my
thoughts
come
tumbling
out
you
at
least
have
always
understood
what
i
meant
always
your
loving
son
gilbert
chapter
xi
married
life
in
london
suburbs
are
commonly
referred
to
as
prosaic
that
is
a
matter
of
taste
personally
i
find
them
introduction
to
the
wedding
day
drew
near
and
the
presents
were
pouring
in
i
feel
like
the
young
man
in
the
gospel
said
gilbert
to
annie
firmin
sorrowful
because
i
have
great
possessions
conrad
noel
married
gilbert
and
frances
at
kensington
parish
church
on
june
as
gilbert
knelt
down
the
price
ticket
on
the
sole
of
one
of
his
new
shoes
became
plainly
visible
annie
caught
chesterton
eye
and
they
began
to
laugh
helplessly
annie
thinks
too
that
for
once
in
their
lives
gilbert
and
cecil
did
not
argue
at
the
reception
lucian
oldershaw
drove
ahead
to
the
station
with
the
heavy
luggage
put
it
on
the
train
and
waited
feverishly
that
train
went
off
with
the
luggage
then
another
and
at
last
the
happy
couple
appeared
gilbert
had
felt
it
necessary
to
stop
on
the
way
in
order
to
drink
a
glass
of
milk
in
one
shop
and
to
buy
a
revolver
with
cartridges
in
another
the
milk
he
drank
because
in
childhood
his
mother
used
to
give
him
a
glass
in
that
shop
the
revolver
was
for
the
defense
of
his
bride
against
possible
dangers
they
followed
the
luggage
by
a
slow
train
this
love
of
weapons
his
revolver
his
favourite
remained
with
him
all
his
life
it
suggested
the
adventures
that
he
always
bestowed
on
the
heroes
of
his
stories
and
would
himself
have
loved
to
experience
he
noted
in
scott
love
of
armour
and
of
weapons
for
their
own
sakes
the
texture
the
power
the
beauty
of
a
or
a
jewelled
dagger
as
a
child
would
play
with
these
things
gilbert
played
with
them
but
they
stood
also
in
his
mind
for
freedom
adventure
personal
responsibility
and
much
else
that
the
modern
world
had
lost
the
honeymoon
was
spent
on
the
norfolk
broads
on
the
way
they
stopped
at
ipswich
and
it
was
like
meeting
a
friend
in
a
to
find
myself
under
the
sign
of
the
white
horse
on
the
first
day
of
my
honeymoon
annie
firmin
was
staying
in
warwick
gardens
for
the
wedding
and
afterwards
gilbert
first
letter
from
the
norfolk
broads
began
i
have
a
wife
a
piece
of
string
a
pencil
and
a
knife
what
more
can
any
man
want
on
a
honeymoon
asked
on
his
return
what
wallpapers
he
would
prefer
in
the
house
they
had
chosen
he
asked
for
brown
paper
so
that
he
could
draw
pictures
everywhere
he
had
by
no
means
abandoned
this
old
habit
and
annie
remembers
an
illness
during
which
he
asked
for
a
long
enough
pencil
to
draw
on
the
ceiling
their
quaint
little
house
in
edwardes
square
kensington
lent
to
them
by
boore
an
old
friend
of
frances
was
close
to
warwick
gardens
i
remember
the
house
well
wrote
bentley
later
with
its
garden
of
old
trees
and
its
general
air
of
georgian
peace
i
remember
too
the
splendid
flaming
frescoes
done
in
vivid
crayons
of
knights
and
heroes
and
divinities
with
which
embellished
the
outside
wall
at
the
back
beneath
a
sheltering
portico
i
have
often
wondered
whether
the
landlord
charged
for
them
as
dilapidations
at
the
end
of
the
tenancy
they
were
only
in
edwardes
square
for
a
few
months
and
then
moved
to
overstrand
mansions
battersea
where
the
rest
of
their
london
life
was
spent
it
was
here
i
came
to
know
them
a
few
years
later
as
soon
as
they
could
afford
it
they
threw
and
together
to
make
one
big
room
at
one
end
hung
an
engagement
board
with
what
father
has
described
as
a
inscription
lest
we
forget
beside
the
engagements
was
pinned
a
poem
by
hilaire
belloc
frances
and
gilbert
have
a
little
flat
at
eighty
pounds
a
year
and
cheap
at
that
where
frances
who
is
gilbert
only
wife
leads
an
unhappy
and
complaining
life
while
gilbert
who
is
frances
only
man
puts
up
with
it
as
gamely
as
he
can
the
bellocs
chose
life
in
the
country
much
earlier
than
the
chestertons
and
an
undated
letter
to
battersea
threatens
due
reprisals
in
an
exclusion
from
their
country
home
if
the
chestertons
are
not
prepared
to
receive
him
in
town
at
a
late
hour
kings
land
shipley
horsham
it
will
annoy
you
a
good
deal
to
hear
that
i
am
in
town
tomorrow
wednesday
evening
and
that
i
shall
appear
at
your
apartment
at
or
at
earliest
you
are
only
just
returned
you
are
hardly
settled
down
it
is
an
intolerable
nuisance
you
heartily
wish
i
had
not
mentioned
it
well
you
see
that
arrow
pointing
to
telegrams
coolham
sussex
if
you
wire
there
before
you
can
put
me
off
but
if
you
do
i
shall
melt
your
keys
both
the
exterior
one
which
forms
the
body
or
form
of
the
matter
and
the
interior
one
which
is
the
mystical
content
thereof
also
if
you
put
me
off
i
shall
not
have
you
down
here
ever
to
see
the
the
the
etc
yrs
early
in
his
battersea
life
gilbert
received
a
note
from
max
beerbohm
the
great
humourist
introducing
himself
and
suggesting
a
luncheon
together
i
am
quite
different
from
my
writings
and
so
i
daresay
are
you
from
yours
so
that
we
should
not
necessarily
fail
to
hit
it
off
i
in
the
flesh
am
modest
full
of
commonsense
very
genial
and
rather
dull
what
you
are
remains
to
be
seen
or
not
to
be
seen
by
me
according
to
your
decision
gilbert
decision
was
for
the
meeting
and
an
instant
liking
grew
into
a
warm
friendship
as
in
days
gilbert
had
written
verse
about
his
friends
so
now
did
he
try
to
sum
up
an
impression
perhaps
after
some
special
talk
and
max
queer
crystalline
sense
lit
like
a
sea
beneath
a
sea
shines
through
a
shameless
impudence
as
shameless
a
humility
or
belloc
somewhat
rudely
roared
but
all
above
him
when
he
spoke
the
immortal
battle
trumpets
broke
and
europe
was
a
single
sword
unpublished
fragment
somewhere
about
this
time
must
have
occurred
the
incident
mentioned
by
george
bernard
shaw
in
a
note
which
appeared
in
the
twain
spring
i
can
not
remember
when
i
first
met
chesterton
i
was
so
much
struck
by
a
review
of
scott
which
he
wrote
for
the
in
the
course
of
his
earliest
notable
job
as
feuilletonist
to
that
paper
that
i
wrote
to
him
asking
who
he
was
and
where
he
came
from
as
he
was
evidently
a
new
star
in
literature
he
was
either
too
shy
or
too
lazy
to
answer
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
his
lunching
with
us
on
quite
intimate
terms
accompanied
by
belloc
the
actual
first
meeting
forgotten
by
shaw
is
remembered
by
gilbert
lucian
oldershaw
he
and
gilbert
had
gone
together
to
paris
where
they
visited
rodin
then
making
a
bust
of
bernard
shaw
oldershaw
introduced
gilbert
to
who
rodin
secretary
told
them
had
been
endeavouring
to
explain
at
some
length
the
nature
of
the
salvation
army
leading
up
one
imagines
to
an
account
of
major
barbara
at
the
end
of
the
explanation
secretary
remarked
to
a
rather
apologetic
shaw
the

shaw
talked
gilbert
down
oldershaw
complained
that
the
famous
man
should
talk
more
than
the
beginner
is
hardly
surprising
but
all
through
gilbert
life
the
complaint
recurs
on
the
lips
of
his
admirers
just
as
a
similar
complaint
is
made
by
lockhart
about
sir
walter
scott
chesterton
like
scott
abounded
in
cordial
admiration
of
other
men
and
women
and
had
a
simple
enjoyment
in
meeting
them
and
chesterton
was
one
of
the
few
great
conversationalists
perhaps
the
only
one
who
would
really
rather
listen
than
talk
in
appeared
his
first
book
of
collected
essays
the
essays
in
it
had
already
appeared
in
like
all
his
later
work
it
had
the
mixed
reception
of
enthusiasts
who
saw
what
he
meant
and
puzzled
reviewers
who
took
refuge
in
that
blessed
word
paradox
paradox
ought
to
be
used
said
one
of
these
like
onions
to
season
the
salad
chesterton
salad
is
all
onions
paradox
has
been
defined
as
standing
on
her
head
to
attract
attention
chesterton
makes
truth
cut
her
throat
to
attract
attention
without
denying
that
his
love
of
a
joke
led
him
into
indefensible
puns
and
suchlike
fooleries
though
mgr
ronald
knox
tells
me
he
is
prepared
to
defend
all
of
puns
i
think
nearly
all
his
paradoxes
were
either
the
startling
expression
of
an
entirely
neglected
truth
or
the
startling
of
the
neglected
side
of
a
truth
once
he
said
it
is
a
paradox
but
it
is
god
and
not
i
who
should
have
the
credit
of
it
he
proved
his
case
a
few
years
later
in
the
chapter
of
called
the
paradoxes
of
christianity
what
it
amounted
to
was
roughly
this
paradox
must
be
of
the
nature
of
things
because
of
god
infinity
and
the
limitations
of
the
world
and
of
man
mind
to
us
limited
beings
god
can
express
his
idea
only
in
fragments
we
can
bring
together
apparent
contradictions
in
those
fragments
whereby
a
greater
truth
is
suggested
if
we
do
this
in
a
sudden
or
incongruous
manner
we
startle
the
unprepared
and
arouse
the
cry
of
paradox
but
if
we
will
not
do
it
we
shall
miss
a
great
deal
of
truth
chesterton
also
saw
many
proverbs
and
old
sayings
as
containing
a
truth
which
the
people
who
constantly
repeated
them
had
forgotten
the
world
was
asleep
and
must
be
awakened
the
world
had
gone
placidly
mad
and
must
be
violently
restored
to
sanity
that
the
methods
he
used
annoyed
some
is
undeniable
but
he
did
force
people
to
think
even
if
they
raged
at
him
as
the
unaccustomed
muscles
came
into
play
i
believe
he
said
in
a
speech
at
this
date
in
getting
into
hot
water
i
think
it
keeps
you
clean
and
he
believed
intensely
in
keeping
out
of
a
narrow
stream
of
merely
literary
life
to
those
who
exalted
the
poet
above
the
journalist
he
gave
this
answer
the
poet
writing
his
name
upon
a
score
of
little
pages
in
the
silence
of
his
study
may
or
may
not
have
an
intellectual
right
to
despise
the
journalist
but
i
greatly
doubt
whether
he
would
not
morally
be
the
better
if
he
saw
the
great
lights
burning
on
through
darkness
into
dawn
and
heard
the
roar
of
the
printing
wheels
weaving
the
destinies
of
another
day
here
at
least
is
a
school
of
labour
and
of
some
rough
humility
the
largest
work
ever
published
anonymously
since
the
great
christian
cathedrals
a
word
for
the
mere
journalist
north
star
february
he
plunged
then
into
the
life
of
fleet
street
and
held
it
his
proudest
boast
to
be
a
journalist
but
he
had
his
own
way
of
being
a
journalist
on
the
whole
i
think
i
owe
my
success
as
the
millionaires
say
to
having
listened
respectfully
and
rather
bashfully
to
the
very
best
advice
given
by
all
the
best
journalists
who
had
achieved
the
best
sort
of
success
in
journalism
and
then
going
away
and
doing
the
exact
opposite
for
what
they
all
told
me
was
that
the
secret
of
success
in
journalism
was
to
study
the
particular
journal
and
write
what
was
suitable
to
it
and
partly
by
accident
and
ignorance
and
partly
through
the
real
rabid
certainties
of
youth
i
can
not
remember
that
i
ever
wrote
any
article
that
was
at
all
suitable
to
any
paper
i
wrote
on
a
nonconformist
organ
like
the
old
and
told
them
all
about
french
cafés
and
catholic
cathedrals
and
they
loved
it
because
they
had
never
heard
of
them
before
i
wrote
on
a
robust
labour
organ
like
the
old
and
defended
mediaeval
theology
and
all
the
things
their
readers
had
never
heard
of
and
their
readers
did
not
mind
me
a
bit
pp
titterton

worked
also
on
the

came
at
this
time
to
know
in
the
pharos
club
says
that
at
first
he
was
rather
shy
of
the
other
men
on
the
staff
but
after
a
dinner
at
which
he
was
asked
to
speak
he
came
to
know
and
like
them
and
to
be
at
home
in
fleet
street
he
liked
to
work
amid
human
contact
and
would
write
his
articles
in

or
even
in

a
description
given
him
by
charles
masterman
of
how
chesterton
used
to
sit
writing
his
articles
in
a
fleet
café
sampling
and
mixing
a
terrible
conjunction
of
drinks
while
many
waiters
hovered
about
him
partly
in
awe
and
partly
in
case
he
should
leave
the
restaurant
without
paying
for
what
he
had
had
one
day
the
headwaiter
approached
masterman
your
friend
he
whispered
admiringly
he
very
clever
man
he
sit
and
laugh
and
then
he
write
and
then
he
laugh
at
what
he
write
p
he
loved
fleet
street
and
did
a
good
deal
of
drinking
there
but
not
only
there
when
in
the
he
writes
of
wine
and
song
it
is
not
fleet
street
and
its
taverns
that
come
back
to
his
mind
but
the
moonstruck
banquets
given
by
maurice

garden
in
westminster
where
he
fenced
with
real
swords
against

more
intoxicated
than
himself

palace
after

frances
seems
to
have
given
up
the
struggle
so
ardently
pursued
during
their
engagement
to
make
him
tidy
by
a
stroke
of
genius
she
decided
instead
to
make
him
picturesque
the
conventional
worn
so
unconventionally
the
silk
hat
crowning
a
mat
of
hair
disappeared
and
a
slouch
hat
and
flowing
cloak
more
appropriately
garbed
him
this
was
especially
good
as
he
got
fatter
he
was
a
tall
man
six
foot
two
as
a
boy
he
had
been
thin
but
now
he
was
rapidly
putting
on
weight
neither
he
nor
cecil
played
games
the
tennis
did
not
last
but
they
used
to
go
for
long
walks
sometimes
going
off
together
for
a
couple
of
days
at
a
time
gilbert
still
liked
to
do
this
with
frances
but
the
sedentary
daily
life
and
the
consumption
of
a
good
deal
of
beer
did
not
help
towards
a
graceful
figure
by
was
called
a
fat
humourist
and
he
was
fast
getting
ready
to
be
johnson
in
various
pageants
by
he
was
then
he
had
become
famous
enough
to
be
one
of
the
celebrities
painted
or
photographed
for
exhibitions
and
bernard
shaw
described
a
photo
of
him
by
coburn
chesterton
is
our
quinbus

the
young
man
mountain
a
large
abounding
gigantically
cherubic
person
who
is
not
only
large
in
body
and
mind
beyond
all
decency
but
seems
to
be
growing
larger
as
you
look
at
him
swellin
wisibly
as
tony
weller
puts
it
coburn
has
represented
him
as
flowing
off
the
plate
in
the
very
act
of
being
photographed
and
blurring
his
own
outlines
in
the
process
also
he
has
caught
the
chestertonian
resemblance
to
balzac
and
unconsciously
handled
his
subject
as
rodin
handled
balzac
you
may
call
the
placing
of
the
head
on
the
plate
wrong
the
focussing
wrong
the
exposure
wrong
if
you
like
but
chesterton
is
right
and
a
right
impression
of
chesterton
is
what
coburn
was
driving
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
celebrated
in
a
stanza
of
his
ballade
of
the
grotesque
i
was
light
as
a
penny
to
spend
i
was
thin
as
an
arrow
to
cleave
i
could
stand
on
a
end
with
composure
though
on
the
but
from
time
all
to
thieve
the
suns
and
the
moons
of
the
year
a
different
shape
i
receive
the
shape
is
decidedly
queer
london
said
a
recently
arrived
american
is
the
most
marvellously
fulfilling
experience
i
went
to
see
fleet
street
this
morning
and
met
chesterton
face
to
face
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
he
was
composing
a
poem
reciting
it
aloud
as
he
wrote
the
most
striking
thing
about
the
incident
was
that
no
one
took
the
slightest
notice
i
doubt
if
any
writer
except
dickens
has
so
quickly
become
an
institution
as
chesterton
nor
of
course
would
his
picturesqueness
in
fleet
street
or
his
swift
success
as
a
journalist
have
accomplished
this
but
for
the
vast
output
of
books
on
every
conceivable
subject
but
before
i
come
to
the
books
written
during
those
years
at
battersea
a
word
must
be
said
of
another
element
besides
his
journalistic
contacts
that
was
linking
with
a
wider
world
than
the
solely
literary
we
have
seen
that
even
when
his
religion
was
at
its
lowest
point
in
the
difficult
art
school
days
he
never
lost
it
entirely
i
hung
on
to
religion
by
one
thin
thread
of
thanks
in
the
years
of
the
notebook
he
advanced
very
far
in
his
pondering
on
and
acceptance
of
the
great
religious
truths
but
this
did
not
as
yet
mean
attachment
to
a
church
then
he
met
frances
she
actually
practised
a
religion
this
was
something
utterly
unaccountable
both
to
me
and
to
the
whole
fussy
culture
in
which
she
lived
now
that
they
were
married
frances
as
a
convinced
was
bringing
more
clergy
and
other
anglican
friends
into
circle
moreover
he
was
lecturing
all
over
england
and
this
brought
him
into
contact
with
all
sorts
of
strange
religious
beliefs
amid
all
this
scattered
thinking
i
began
to
piece
together
fragments
of
the
old
religious
scheme
mainly
by
the
various
gaps
that
denoted
its
disappearance
and
the
more
i
saw
of
real
human
nature
the
more
i
came
to
suspect
that
it
was
really
rather
bad
for
all
these
people
that
it
had
disappeared
p
in
he
had
a
tremendous
battle
the
detail
of
which
will
be
treated
in
the
next
chapter
in
the
with
robert
blatchford
in
it
he
adumbrated
many
of
the
ideas
that
were
later
developed
in
of
the
arguments
used
by
blatchford
and
his
atheist
friends
wrote
that
the
effect
on
his
own
mind
was
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
in
a
diary
kept
by
frances
spasmodically
during
the
years
she
notes
that
gilbert
has
been
asked
to
preach
as
the
first
of
a
series
of
lay
preachers
in
a
city
church
she
writes
one
of
the
proudest
days
of
my
life
gilbert
preached
at
paul
covent
garden
for
the
christian
social
union
populi
vox
a
crammed
church
he
was
very
eloquent
and
restrained
sermons
will
be
published
afterwards
published
they
were
under
the
title
from
the
the
second
sermon
the
citizen
the
gentleman
and
the
savage
even
better
than
last
week
where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perisheth
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
the
and
the
of
notting
had
all
been
published
and
received
with
acclaim
it
is
touching
that
frances
should
speak
thus
of
the
proudest
day
of
her
life
that
gilbert
should
himself
have
vision
and
show
it
to
others
remained
her
strongest
aspiration
not
thus
felt
all
his
admirers
the
blatchford
controversy
on
matters
religious
became
more
than
many
of
them
could
bear
a
plaintive
correspondent
says
the
who
seems
to
have
had
enough
of
the
eternal
verities
and
the
eternal
other
things
sends
us
the
following
lines
written
on
reading
chesterton
reply
to
a
secularist
opponent
what
ails
our
wondrous
who
late
on
youth
glad
wings
flew
fairylike
and
gossip
free
of
translunary
things
that
thus
in
dull
didactic
mood
he
quits
the
realms
of
dream
and
like
some
rude
drones
on
one
dreary
theme
stern
blatchford
hast
dashed
the
glee
of
our
omniscient
babe
thy
name
alone
now
murmurs
he
or
that
of
dark
mccabe
all
vain
his
cloudy
fancies
swell
his
paradox
all
vain
obsessed
by
that
malignant
spell
of
blatchford
on
the
brain
january
noel
has
a
livelier
memory
of
gilbert
religious
and
social
activities
on
one
occasion
he
went
to
the
battersea
flat
for
a
meeting
at
which
he
was
to
speak
and
gilbert
take
the
chair
to
establish
a
local
branch
of
the
christian
social
union
the
two
men
got
into
talk
over
their
wine
in
the
then
still
a
separate
room
and
frances
came
in
much
agitated
gilbert
you
must
dress
the
people
will
be
arriving
any
moment
yes
yes
i
go
the
argument
was
resumed
and
went
on
with
animation
frances
came
back
gilbert
the
is
half
full
and
people
are
still
arriving
at
last
in
despair
she
brought
gilbert
into
the
and
made
him
change
there
still
arguing
next
he
had
to
be
urged
into
the
established
at
a
small
table
he
began
to
draw
comic
bishops
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
to
take
the
chair
at
the
now
assembled
meeting
finally
frances
managed
to
attract
his
attention
he
leaped
up
overthrowing
the
small
table
and
scattering
the
comic
bishops
surely
this
story
said
a
friend
to
whom
i
told
it
proves
what
some
people
said
about
chesterton
affectation
he
must
have
been
posing
i
do
not
think
so
and
those
who
knew
gilbert
best
believed
him
incapable
of
posing
but
he
was
perfectly
capable
of
wilfulness
and
of
sulking
like
a
schoolboy
it
amused
him
to
argue
with
noel
it
did
not
amuse
him
at
all
to
take
the
chair
at
a
meeting
so
as
he
was
not
allowed
to
go
on
arguing
he
drew
comic
bishops
there
was
too
more
than
a
touch
of
this
wilfulness
in
the
second
shock
he
administered
to
respectable
battersea
later
in
the
evening
an
earnest
young
lady
asked
the
company
for
counsel
as
to
the
best
way
of
arranging
her
solitary
maid
evening
out
i
so
afraid
ended
the
appeal
of
her
going
to
the
red
lion
best
place
she
could
go
said
gilbert
and
occasionally
he
would
add
example
to
precept
for
society
and
fleet
street
were
not
the
only
places
for
human
intercourse
at
present
commented
a
journalist
he
is
cultivating
the
local
politics
of
battersea
in
secluded
ale
houses
he
drinks
with
the
frequenters
and
learns
their
opinions
on
municipal
milk
and
on
john
burns
good
friends
and
very
gay
companions
gilbert
calls
the
christian
social
union
group
of
whom
beside
conrad
noel
were
charles
masterman
bishop
gore
percy
dearmer
and
above
all
canon
scott
holland
known
as
scotty
and
adored
by
many
generations
of
young
men
he
was
a
man
with
a
natural
surge
of
laughter
within
him
so
that
his
broad
mouth
seemed
always
to
be
shut
down
on
it
in
a
grimace
of
restraint
like
gilbert
he
suffered
from
the
effect
of
urging
his
most
serious
views
with
apparent
flippancy
and
fantastic
illustrations
in
the
course
of
a
speech
to
a
respectable
nottingham
audience
he
remarked
i
dare
say
several
of
you
here
have
never
been
in
prison
p
a
ghastly
stare
says
gilbert
describing
this
speech
was
fixed
on
all
the
faces
of
the
audience
and
i
have
ever
since
seen
it
in
my
own
dreams
for
it
has
constituted
a
considerable
part
of
my
own
problem
gilbert
verses
summarizing
the
meeting
as
it
must
have
sounded
to
a
worthy
nottingham
tradesman
are
quoted
in
the
and
completed
in
brown
on
i
have
put
them
together
here
for
they
show
how
merrily
these
men
were
working
to
change
the
world
the
christian
social
union
here
was
very
much
annoyed
it
seems
there
is
some
duty
which
we
never
should
avoid
and
so
they
sang
a
lot
of
hymns
to
help
the
unemployed
upon
a
platform
at
the
end
the
speakers
were
displayed
and
bishop
hoskins
stood
in
front
and
hit
a
bell
and
said
that
carter
was
to
pray
and
carter
prayed
then
bishop
gore
of
birmingham
he
stood
upon
one
leg
and
said
he
would
be
happier
if
beggars
did
beg
and
that
if
they
pinched
his
palace
it
would
take
him
down
a
peg
he
said
that
unemployment
was
a
horror
and
a
blight
he
said
that
charities
produced
servility
and
spite
and
stood
upon
the
other
leg
and
said
it
was
right
and
then
a
man
named
chesterton
got
up
and
played
with
water
he
seemed
to
say
that
principles
were
nice
and
led
to
slaughter
and
how
we
always
compromised
and
how
we
did
orter
then
canon
holland
fired
ahead
like
fifty
cannons
firing
we
tried
to
find
out
what
he
meant
with
infinite
enquiring
but
the
way
he
made
the
windows
jump
we
could
help
admiring
i
understood
him
to
remark
it
seemed
a
little
odd
that
half
a
dozen
of
his
friends
had
never
been
in
quod
he
said
he
was
a
socialist
himself
and
so
was
god
he
said
the
human
soul
should
be
ashamed
of
every
sham
he
said
a
man
should
constantly
ejaculate
i
am
when
he
had
done
i
went
outside
and
got
into
a
tram
partly
perhaps
to
console
himself
for
the
loss
of
his
son
daily
company
chiefly
i
imagine
out
of
sheer
pride
and
joy
in
his
success
edward
chesterton
started
after
the
publication
of
wild
pasting
all
gilbert
into
volumes
later
i
learnt
that
it
had
long
been
gilbert
weekly
penance
to
read
these
cuttings
on
sunday
afternoon
at
his
father
house
traces
of
his
passage
are
visible
wherever
a
space
admits
of
a
caricature
and
occasionally
where
it
does
not
the
caricature
is
superimposed
on
the
text
his
growing
fame
may
be
seen
by
the
growing
size
of
these
volumes
and
the
increased
space
given
to
each
of
his
books
in
had
a
good
press
for
a
young
man
work
and
was
taken
seriously
in
some
important
papers
but
its
success
was
as
nothing
compared
with
that
of
the
a
year
later
the
bulk
of
as
of
had
appeared
in
periodicals
but
never
in
his
life
did
gilbert
prepare
a
volume
of
his
essays
for
the
press
without
improving
changing
and
unifying
it
was
never
merely
a
collection
always
a
book
still
the
was
another
matter
it
was
a
compliment
for
a
comparatively
new
author
to
be
given
the
commission
for
the
english
men
of
letters
series
stephen
gwynn
describes
the
experience
of
the
publishers
on
my
advice
the
macmillans
had
asked
him
to
do
browning
in
the
english
men
of
letters
when
he
was
still
not
quite
arrived
old
craik
the
senior
partner
sent
for
me
and
i
found
him
in
white
fury
with
chesterton
proofs
corrected
in
pencil
or
rather
not
corrected
there
were
still
thirteen
errors
uncorrected
on
one
page
mostly
in
quotations
from
browning
a
selection
from
a
scotch
ballad
had
been
quoted
from
memory
and
three
of
the
four
lines
were
wrong
i
wrote
to
chesterton
saying
that
the
firm
thought
the
book
was
going
to
disgrace
them
his
reply
was
like
the
trumpeting
of
a
crushed
elephant
but
the
book
was
a
huge
success
quoted
in
by
cyril
clemens
p
in
fact
it
created
a
sensation
and
established
in
the
front
rank
not
all
the
reviewers
liked
it
and
one
angry
writer
in
the
pointed
out
that
not
content
with
innumerable
inaccuracies
about
browning
descent
and
the
events
of
his
life
had
even
invented
a
line
in
sludge
the
medium
but
every
important
paper
had
not
only
a
review
but
a
long
review
and
the
vast
majority
were
enthusiastic
chesterton
claimed
browning
as
a
poet
not
for
experts
but
for
every
man
his
treatment
of
the
browning
love
affair
of
the
poet
obscurity
of
the
ring
and
the
book
all
receive
this
same
praise
of
an
originality
which
casts
a
true
and
revealing
light
for
his
readers
as
with
all
his
literary
criticism
the
most
famous
critics
admitted
that
he
had
opened
fresh
windows
on
the
subject
for
themselves
this
attack
on
his
inaccuracy
and
admiration
for
his
insight
constantly
recurs
with
chesterton
literary
work
readers
noted
that
in
the
of
the
white
he
made
alfred
left
wing
face
guthrum
left
wing
he
was
amused
when
it
was
pointed
out
but
never
bothered
to
alter
it
his
memory
was
prodigious
all
his
friends
testify
to
his
knowing
by
heart
pages
of
his
favourite
authors
and
these
were
not
few
ten
years
after
his
time
with
fisher
unwin
frances
told
father
that
he
remembered
all
the
plots
and
most
of
the
characters
of
the
thousands
of
novels
he
had
read
for
the
firm
but
he
trusted
his
memory
too
much
and
never
verified
indeed
when
it
was
a
question
merely
of
verbal
quotation
he
said
it
was
pedantic
to
bother
and
when
latterly
dorothy
collins
looked
up
his
references
he
barely
tolerated
it
again
while
he
constantly
declared
that
he
was
no
scholar
he
said
things
illuminating
even
to
scholars
thus
much
later
when
chesterton
thomas
appeared
the
of
the
dominican
order
père
gillet
lectured
on
and
from
it
to
large
meetings
of
dominicans
eccles
told
me
that
talking
of
virgil
said
things
immensely
illuminating
for
experts
on
latin
poetry
in
a
very
different
field
oldershaw
noted
after
their
trip
to
paris
that
though
he
could
set
gilbert
right
on
many
a
detail
yet
his
generalisations
were
marvellous
he
had
said
eccles
an
intuitive
mind
he
had
too
read
more
than
was
realised
partly
because
his
carelessness
and
contempt
for
scholarship
misled
where
the
pedant
would
have
referred
and
quoted
and
he
went
dashing
on
throwing
out
ideas
from
his
abundance
and
caring
little
if
among
his
wealth
were
a
few
faults
of
fact
or
interpretation
abundance
was
a
word
much
used
of
his
work
just
now
and
in
the
field
of
literary
criticism
he
was
placed
high
and
had
an
enthusiastic
following
we
may
assume
that
the
had
something
to
do
with
sir
oliver
lodge
asking
him
in
the
next
year
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
chair
of
literature
at
birmingham
university
but
he
had
no
desire
to
be
a
professor
frances
in
her
diary
notes
some
of
their
widening
contacts
and
engagements
the
mixture
of
shrewdness
and
simplicity
in
her
comments
will
be
familiar
to
those
who
knew
her
intimately
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
i
think
the
main
impression
was
that
of
the
single
eye
she
abounded
in
gilbert
sense
as
my
mother
commented
after
an
early
meeting
and
ministered
to
his
genius
yet
she
never
lost
an
individual
markedly
feminine
point
of
view
which
helped
him
greatly
as
anyone
can
see
who
will
read
all
he
wrote
on
marriage
he
shows
an
insight
almost
uncanny
in
the
section
called
the
mistake
about
women
in
wrong
with
the
some
people
he
said
in
a
speech
of
when
married
gain
each
other
some
only
lose
themselves
the
chestertons
gained
each
other
and
by
the
sort
of
paradox
he
loved
frances
did
so
by
throwing
the
stream
of
her
own
life
unreservedly
into
the
greater
river
of
her
husband
she
writes
in
her
diary
for
gilbert
and
i
meet
all
sorts
of
queer
attractive
unattractive
people
and
i
expect
this
book
will
be
mostly
about
them
we
went
together
to
and
sidney
colvin
at
home
it
was
rather
jolly
but
too
many
clever
people
there
to
be
really
nice
the
clever
people
were
joseph
conrad
henry
james
laurence
binyon
maurice
hewlett
and
a
great
many
more
and
colvin
looked
so
happy
gilbert
went
as
lane
guest
to
a
dinner
of
the
odd
volumes
at
the
imperial
restaurant
the
other
guest
was
baden
powell
he
and
gilbert
made
speeches
march
gilbert
was
to
speak
on
education
at
a
meeting
at
sion
college
but
a
debate
on
the
chinese
labour
in
south
africa
was
introduced
instead
and
went
excitingly
there
is
to
be
a
big
meeting
of
the
to
protest
though
i
suppose
it
all
no
good
now
when
the
meeting
was
over
we
adjourned
to
a
and
had
immense
fun
gilbert
percy
dearmer
and
conrad
noel
walked
together
down
fleet
street
and
never
was
there
a
funnier
sight
costume
consisted
of
a
frock
coat
huge
felt
hat
and
walking
stick
brandished
in
the
face
of
the
to
their
exceeding
great
danger
conrad
was
dressed
in
an
old
lounge
suit
of
sober
grey
with
a
clerical
hat
jauntily
stuck
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
led
someone
to
remark
are
you
here
in
the
capacity
of
a
private
gentleman
poor
curate
or
actor
dearmer
was
clad
in
wonderful
clerical
garments
of
which
he
alone
possesses
the
pattern
which
made
him
look
like
a
chaucer
canterbury
pilgrim
or
a
figure
out
of
a
noah
ark
they
swaggered
down
the
roadway
talking
energetically
at
tea
we
talked
of
many
things
the
future
of
the
commonwealth
chiefly
march
meeting
of
christian
theosophical
society
at
which
gilbert
lectured
on
how
theosophy
appears
to
a
christian
he
was
very
good
herbert
burrows
vigorously
attacked
him
in
debate
afterwards
of
notting
was
published
april
the
bellocs
and
the
noels
came
here
to
dinner
hilaire
in
great
form
recited
his
own
poetry
with
great
enthusiasm
the
whole
evening
may
the
literary
fund
dinner
about
the
greatest
treat
i
ever
had
in
my
life
barrie
presided
he
was
so
splendid
and
so
complimentary
barrie
is
very
pretty
but
the
most
beautiful
woman
there
was
anthony
hope
copper
coloured
hair
masses
with
a
wreath
of
gardenias
green
eyes
and
a
long
neck
very
beautiful
figure
the
speakers
were
barrie
lord
tennyson
comyns
carr
mason
craigie
who
acquitted
herself
wonderfully
and
flora
annie
steel
after
the
formal
dinner
was
a
reception
at
which
everyone
was
very
friendly
it
is
wonderful
the
way
in
which
they
all
accept
gilbert
and
one
man
told
me
he
was
the
biggest
man
present
anyhow
there
was
the
feeling
of
brotherhood
and
fellowship
in
the
wielding
of
the
lovely
and
loathely
pen
barrie
speech
may
went
to
see
max
beerbohm
caricature
of
gilbert
at
the
carfax
gallery
humanist
kissing
the
world
it
more
like
thackeray
very
funny
though
june
a
political
at
home
at
sidney
webb
saw
winston
churchill
and
lloyd
george
politics
and
nothing
but
politics
is
dull
work
though
and
an
intriguer
life
must
be
a
pretty
poor
affair
sidney
webb
looked
very
handsome
and
moved
among
her
guests
as
one
to
the
manner
born
i
like
leonard
courtenay
who
is
always
kind
to
me
charlie
masterman
and
i
had
a
long
talk
on
the
iniquities
of
the
daily
news
and
goodness
knows
they
are
serious
enough
june
an
at
home
at
proved
rather
a
dull
affair
save
for
a
nice
little
conversation
with
watts
dunton
his
walrusy
appearance
which
makes
the
bottom
of
his
face
look
fierce
is
counteracted
by
the
kindness
of
his
little
eyes
he
told
us
the
inner
story
of
whistler
peacock
room
which
scarcely
redounds
to
whistler
credit
the
duchess
of
sutherland
was
there
and
many
notabilities
between
ourselves
is
a
snob
his
wife
nice
intelligent
but
affected
i
suppose
unconsciously
i
do
really
like
the
precious
people
they
worry
me
june
graham
robertson
at
home
was
exceedingly
select
i
felt
rather
too
uncultivated
to
talk
much
lane
tucked
his
arm
into
mine
and
requested
to
know
the
news
which
means
tell
me
all
your
husband
is
doing
or
going
to
do
how
much
is
he
getting
who
will
publish
for
him
has
he
sold
his
american
rights
etc
three
daughters
looked
out
of
place
so
solid
and
sincere
are
they
it
was
all
too
grand
no
man
ought
to
have
so
much
wealth
july
gilbert
went
today
to
see
swinburne
i
think
he
found
it
rather
hard
to
reconcile
the
idea
with
the
man
but
he
was
interested
though
i
could
not
gather
much
about
the
visit
he
was
amused
at
the
compliments
which
watts
dunton
and
swinburne
pay
to
each
other
unceasingly
december
george
alexander
has
an
idea
that
he
wants
gilbert
to
write
a
play
for
him
and
sent
for
him
to
come
and
see
him
he
was
apparently
taken
with
the
notion
of
a
play
on
the
crusades
and
although
there
is
at
present
no
love
incident
in
gilbert
mind
alexander
introduced
and
acted
the
supposed
love
scene
with
great
spirit
it
may
come
off
some
day
perhaps
december
belloc
been
very
ill
but
is
better
thank
god
gilbert
a
guest
at
the
eighty
club
dinner
rhoda
and
i
went
to
after
dinner
speeches
russell
chair
augustine
birrell
guest
and
sir
henry
fowler
it
amused
me
hugely
russell
so
imprudent
and
reckless
birrell
so
prudent
and
incapable
of
giving
himself
away
sir
henry
fowler
so
commonplace
and
trite
he
looked
so
wicked
i
thought
of
haldane
story
of
fowler
fur
coat
and
his
single
remark
on
examining
it
skunk
rather
an
interesting
lunch
at
green
jack
yeats
and
thursby
were
there
the
atmosphere
is
too
political
and
i
imagine
green
to
be
a
bit
of
a
though
i
believe
a
nice
woman
halliwell
sutcliffe
came
over
he
is
amusing
and
nice
very
puzzled
at
gilbert
conduct
which
on
this
particular
occasion
was
peculiarly
eccentric
march
i
had
an
amusing
lunch
at
the
hotel
cecil
with
miss
bisland
representative
of
mcclure
evidently
thinks
a
lot
of
gilbert
and
wants
his
work
for
mcclure
o
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
the
diplomatic
service
ought
to
be
all
conducted
by
women
i
offered
her
margaret
poems
in
exchange
for
a
short
interview
with
meredith
which
she
wishes
gilbert
to
undertake
march
gilbert
dined
at
the
buxtons
met
asquith
march
lienie
is
in
town
and
we
have
been
with
her
to
call
on
the
duchess
of
sutherland
when
i
had
got
used
to
the
splendour
it
was
jolly
enough
her
grace
is
a
pretty
sweet
woman
who
was
very
nervous
but
got
better
under
the
fire
of
gilbert
chaff
she
made
him
write
in
her
album
which
he
did
a
most
ridiculous
poem
of
which
he
should
be
ashamed
it
must
be
truly
awful
to
live
in
the
sort
of
way
the
duchess
does
and
endeavour
to
keep
sane
may
words
fail
me
when
i
try
to
recall
the
sensation
aroused
by
a
dinner
it
seems
so
odd
to
think
of
these
men
as
boys
to
realize
what
their
school
life
was
and
what
a
powerful
element
the
was
in
the
lives
of
all
and
there
were
husbands
and
wives
and
the
tie
so
strong
and
the
long
long
thoughts
of
schoolboys
and
schoolgirls
fell
on
us
as
if
the
battle
were
still
to
come
instead
of
raging
round
us
may
we
went
together
to
see
george
meredith
i
suppose
many
people
have
seen
him
in
his
little
surrey
cottage
flint
cottage
boxhill
he
has
a
wonderful
face
and
a
frail
old
body
he
talks
without
stopping
except
to
drink
he
told
us
many
stories
mostly
about
society
scandals
of
some
time
back
i
remember
he
asked
gilbert
do
you
like
babies
and
when
gilbert
said
yes
he
said
so
do
i
especially
in
the
comet
stage
june
granville
barker
came
to
see
gilbert
touching
the
possibility
of
a
play
june
a
garden
party
at
the
bishop
house
kennington
the
bishop
told
me
that
balfour
was
very
impressed
with
heretics
guild
of
matthew
service
and
rowdy
supper
gilbert
made
an
excellent
speech
july
gilbert
dined
at
the
asquiths
met
rosebery
i
think
he
hated
it
july
gilbert
went
to
see
grenfell
at
taplow
he
met
balfour
austen
chamberlain
and
george
wyndham
had
an
amusing
time
no
doubt
says
balfour
is
most
interesting
to
talk
to
but
appears
bored
george
wyndham
is
delightful
one
felt
always
with
both
frances
and
gilbert
that
this
society
life
stayed
on
the
surface
amusing
distracting
sometimes
welcome
sometimes
boring
but
never
infringing
the
deeper
reality
of
their
relationships
with
old
friends
with
their
own
families
with
each
other
frances
wrote
endless
business
and
other
letters
for
them
both
in
just
a
handful
mainly
to
father
does
she
show
her
deeper
life
of
thought
and
feeling
gilbert
had
little
time
now
for
writing
anything
but
books
and
articles
never
a
very
good
correspondent
he
had
become
an
exceedingly
bad
one
annie
engagement
to
robert
kidd
produced
one
of
the
few
letters
that
exist
it
is
handwritten
and
undated
a
restaurant
somewhere
my
dear
annie
i
have
thought
of
you
i
am
quite
certain
more
often
than
i
have
of
any
human
being
for
a
long
time
past
except
my
wife
who
recalls
herself
continually
to
me
by
virtues
splendours
agreeable
memories
screams
pokers
brickbats
and
other
things
and
yet
though
whenever
my
mind
was
for
an
instant
emptied
of
theology
and
journalism
and
patriotism
and
such
rot
it
has
been
immediately
filled
with
you
i
have
never
written
you
a
line
i
am
not
going
to
explain
this
and
for
a
good
reason
it
is
a
part
of
the
mystery
of
the
male
and
you
will
soon
even
if
you
do
not
already
get
the
hang
of
it
by
the
society
of
an
individual
who
while
being
unmistakably
a
much
better
man
than
i
am
is
nevertheless
male
i
can
only
say
that
when
men
want
a
thing
they
act
quite
differently
to
women
we
put
off
everything
we
want
to
do
in
the
ordinary
way
if
the
archangel
michael
wrote
me
a
complimentary
letter
tomorrow
as
perhaps
he
may
i
should
put
it
in
my
pocket
saying
how
admirable
a
reply
shall
i
write
to
that
in
a
week
or
a
month
or
so
i
put
off
writing
to
you
because
i
wanted
to
write
something
that
had
in
it
all
that
you
have
been
to
me
to
all
of
us
and
now
instead
i
am
scrawling
this
nonsense
in
a
tavern
after
lunch
my
very
dear
old
friend
i
am
of
a
sex
that
very
seldom
takes
real
trouble
that
forgets
the
little
necessities
of
time
that
is
by
nature
lazy
i
never
wanted
really
but
one
thing
in
my
life
and
that
i
got
any
person
inspecting
overstrand
mansions
may
see
that
somewhat
excitable
thing
free
of
charge
in
another
person
whom
with
maddening
jealousy
i
suspect
of
being
some
inches
taller
than
i
am
i
believe
i
notice
the
same
tendency
towards
monomania
he
also
being
as
i
have
so
keenly
pointed
out
male
he
also
i
think
has
only
wanted
one
thing
seriously
in
his
life
he
also
has
got
it
another
male
weakness
which
i
recognize
with
sympathy
all
my
reviewers
call
me
frivolous
do
you
think
all
this
kind
of
thing
frivolous
damn
it
all
excuse
me
what
can
one
be
but
frivolous
about
serious
things
without
frivolity
they
are
simply
too
tremendous
that
you
who
with
your
hair
down
your
back
played
at
bricks
with
me
in
a
house
of
which
i
have
no
memory
except
you
and
the
bricks
that
you
should
be
taken
by
someone
of
my
miserable
sex
as
you
ought
to
be
what
is
one
to
say
i
am
not
going
to
wish
you
happiness
because
i
am
quite
placidly
certain
that
your
happiness
is
inevitable
i
know
it
because
my
wife
is
happy
with
me
and
the
wild
weird
extravagant
singular
origin
of
this
is
a
certain
enduring
fact
in
my
psychology
which
you
will
find
paralleled
elsewhere
god
bless
you
my
dear
girl
yours
ever
gilbert
chesterton
married
in
annie
and
her
husband
took
another
flat
in
overstrand
mansions
gilbert
never
cared
what
he
wore
she
writes
i
remember
one
night
when
my
husband
and
i
were
living
in
the
same
block
of
flats
he
came
in
to
ask
me
to
go
and
sit
with
frances
who
was
very
well
while
he
went
down
to
the
house
to
dine
with
hugh
law
gilbert
was
very
correctly
dressed
except
for
the
fact
that
he
had
on
one
boot
and
one
slipper
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
and
he
said
you
think
it
matters
i
told
him
i
was
sure
frances
would
not
like
him
to
go
out
like
that
the
only
argument
to
affect
him
when
he
was
staying
with
me
here
in
vancouver
dorothy
collins
had
to
give
him
the
before
he
went
lecturing
they
had
left
frances
in
palos
verdes
as
she
was
well
in
were
published
a
monograph
on
watts
napoleon
of
notting
and
an
important
chapter
in
a
composite
book
a
the
is
among
the
results
of
gilbert
art
studies
its
reviewers
admired
it
somewhat
in
the
degree
of
their
admiration
for
the
painter
but
for
a
young
man
at
that
date
to
have
seen
the
principles
of
art
he
lays
down
meant
rare
vision
the
he
says
is
trying
to
express
the
reality
of
the
man
himself
but
he
is
not
above
taking
hints
from
the
book
of
life
with
its
quaint
old
woodcuts
makes
us
see
all
the
painter
could
have
thought
or
imagined
as
he
sets
us
before
mammon
or
jonah
or
hope
and
bids
us
read
their
legend
and
note
the
texture
and
lines
of
the
painting
his
distinction
between
the
irish
mysticism
of
yeats
and
the
english
mysticism
of
watts
is
especially
valuable
and
the
book
perhaps
even
more
than
the
or
the
manifests
gilbert
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
last
generation
the
depths
and
limitations
of
the
victorian
outlook
may
be
read
in
the
story
of
the
writing
of
was
told
me
in
part
by
frances
while
part
appeared
in
an
given
by
gilbert
in
which
he
called
it
his
first
important
book
quoted
in
by
cyril
clemens
pp
i
was
broke
only
ten
shillings
in
my
pocket
leaving
my
worried
wife
i
went
down
fleet
street
got
a
shave
and
then
ordered
for
myself
at
the
cheshire
cheese
an
enormous
luncheon
of
my
favourite
dishes
and
a
bottle
of
wine
it
took
my
all
but
i
could
then
go
to
my
publishers
fortified
i
told
them
i
wanted
to
write
a
book
and
outlined
the
story
of
napoleon
of
notting
hill
but
i
must
have
twenty
pounds
i
said
before
i
begin
we
will
send
it
to
you
on
monday
if
you
want
the
book
i
replied
you
will
have
to
give
it
to
me
today
as
i
am
disappearing
to
write
it
they
gave
it
frances
meanwhile
sat
at
home
thinking
as
she
told
me
hard
thoughts
of
his
disappearance
with
their
only
remaining
coin
and
then
dramatically
he
appeared
with
twenty
golden
sovereigns
and
poured
them
into
her
lap
referring
to
this
incident
later
gilbert
said
what
a
fool
a
man
is
when
he
comes
to
the
last
ditch
not
to
spend
the
last
farthing
to
satisfy
the
inner
man
before
he
goes
out
to
fight
a
battle
with
wits
but
it
was
his
way
to
let
the
money
shortage
become
acute
and
then
deal
with
it
abruptly
frank
swinnerton
relates
that
when
as
a
small
boy
he
was
working
for
dent
gilbert
appeared
after
office
hours
with
a
dickens
preface
but
refused
to
leave
it
because
swinnerton
the
only
soul
left
in
the
place
could
not
give
him
the
agreed
remuneration
the
is
the
story
of
a
war
between
the
london
suburbs
and
grew
largely
from
his
meditations
on
the
boer
war
besides
being
the
best
of
his
fantastic
stories
it
contains
the
most
picturesque
account
of
chesterton
social
philosophy
that
he
ever
gave
but
it
certainly
puzzled
some
of
the
critics
one
american
reviewer
feels
that
he
might
have
understood
the
book
if
he
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
various
boroughs
of
london
and
of
their
characteristics
others
treat
the
story
as
a
mere
joke
and
many
feel
that
it
is
a
bad
descent
after
the
too
infernally
clever
for
anything
says
one
auberon
quin
king
of
england
chosen
by
lot
as
are
all
kings
and
all
other
officials
by
the
date
of
this
story
which
is
a
romance
of
the
future
is
one
of
the
two
heroes
of
this
book
he
is
simply
a
sense
of
humour
incarnate
his
little
elfish
face
and
figure
was
recognised
by
old
paulines
as
suggested
by
a
form
master
of
their
youth
but
by
the
entire
reviewing
world
as
max
beerbohm
the
illustrations
by
graham
robertson
were
held
to
be
unmistakably
max
frances
notes
in
her
diary
a
delightful
dinner
party
at
the
lanes
the
talk
was
mostly
about
max
took
me
in
to
dinner
and
was
really
nice
he
is
a
good
fellow
his
costume
was
extraordinary
why
should
an
evening
waistcoat
have
four
large
white
pearl
buttons
and
why
should
he
look
that
peculiar
shape
he
seems
only
pleased
at
the
way
he
has
been
identified
with
king
auberon
all
right
my
dear
chap
he
said
to
who
was
trying
to
apologize
lane
and
i
settled
it
all
at
a
lunch
i
think
he
was
a
little
put
out
at
finding
no
red
carpet
put
down
for
his
royal
feet
and
we
had
quite
a
discussion
as
to
whether
he
ought
to
precede
me
into
the
dining
room
graham
robertson
was
on
my
left
he
was
jolly
too
kept
on
producing
wonderful
rings
and
stones
out
of
his
pockets
he
said
he
wished
he
could
go
about
covered
in
the
pieces
of
a
chandelier
the
other
guests
were
lady
seton
clifford
howells
and
his
daughter
too
to
be
really
attractive
taylor
police
magistrate
and
eichholz
lane
mother
who
is
more
beautiful
than
anything
except
a
wee
baby
in
fact
she
looks
exactly
like
one
so
dainty
and
small
she
can
never
at
any
time
have
been
as
pretty
as
she
is
now
gilbert
and
max
and
i
drove
to
his
house
max
where
he
basely
enticed
us
in
he
gave
me
fearful
preserved
fruits
which
ruined
my
dress
but
he
made
himself
very
entertaining
home
caring
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
joke
king
auberon
decrees
that
the
dull
and
respectable
london
boroughs
shall
be
given
city
guards
in
resplendent
armour
each
borough
to
have
its
own
coat
of
arms
its
city
walls
tocsin
and
the
like
the
idea
is
taken
seriously
by
the
second
hero
adam
wayne
of
notting
hill
an
enthusiast
utterly
lacking
any
sense
of
humour
who
goes
to
war
with
the
other
boroughs
of
london
to
protect
a
small
street
which
they
have
designed
to
pull
down
in
the
interests
of
commercial
development
pimlico
kensington
and
the
rest
attack
notting
hill
men
bleed
and
die
in
the
contest
and
by
the
magic
of
the
sword
the
old
ideas
of
local
patriotism
and
beauty
in
civic
life
return
to
england
the
conventional
politician
barker
who
begins
the
story
in
a
and
irreproachable
silk
hat
ends
it
clad
in
purple
and
gold
when
notting
hill
become
imperial
minded
goes
down
to
destruction
in
a
sea
of
blood
auberon
quin
confesses
to
wayne
that
this
whole
story
so
full
of
human
tragedy
and
hopes
and
fears
had
been
merely
the
outcome
of
a
joke
to
him
all
life
was
a
joke
to
wayne
an
epic
and
this
antagonism
between
the
humorist
and
the
fanatic
has
created
the
whole
wild
story
wayne
has
the
last
word
i
know
of
something
that
will
alter
that
antagonism
something
that
is
outside
us
something
that
you
and
i
have
all
our
lives
perhaps
taken
too
little
account
of
the
equal
and
eternal
human
being
will
alter
that
antagonism
for
the
human
being
sees
no
real
antagonism
between
laughter
and
respect
the
human
being
the
common
man
whom
mere
geniuses
like
you
and
me
can
only
worship
like
a
god
when
dark
and
dreary
days
come
you
and
i
are
necessary
the
pure
fanatic
the
pure
satirist
we
have
between
us
remedied
a
great
wrong
we
have
lifted
the
modern
cities
into
that
poetry
which
every
one
who
knows
mankind
knows
to
be
immeasurably
more
common
than
the
commonplace
but
in
healthy
people
there
is
no
war
between
us
we
are
but
the
two
lobes
of
the
brain
of
a
ploughman
laughter
and
love
are
everywhere
the
cathedrals
built
in
the
ages
that
loved
god
are
full
of
blasphemous
grotesques
the
mother
laughs
continually
at
the
child
the
lover
laughs
continually
at
the
lover
the
wife
at
the
husband
the
friend
at
the
friend
auberon
quin
we
have
been
too
long
separated
let
us
go
out
together
you
have
a
halberd
and
i
a
sword
let
us
start
our
wanderings
over
the
world
for
we
are
its
two
essentials
come
it
is
already
day
in
the
blank
white
light
auberon
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
made
the
formal
salute
with
his
halberd
and
they
went
away
together
into
the
unknown
world
this
is
very
important
to
the
understanding
of
chesterton
with
him
profound
gravity
and
exuberant
fooling
were
always
intermingled
and
some
of
his
deepest
thoughts
are
conveyed
by
a
pun
he
always
claimed
to
be
intensely
serious
while
hating
to
be
solemn
and
it
was
a
mixture
apt
to
be
misunderstood
if
gravity
and
humour
are
the
two
lobes
of
the
average
man
brain
the
average
man
does
not
bring
them
into
play
simultaneously
to
anything
like
the
extent
that
chesterton
did
auberon
quin
and
adam
wayne
are
the
most
living
individuals
in
any
of
his
novels
just
because
they
are
the
two
lobes
of
his
brain
individualised
all
his
stories
abound
in
adventure
are
admirable
in
their
vivid
descriptions
of
london
or
the
countryside
of
france
or
england
seen
in
fantastic
visions
they
are
living
in
the
portrayal
of
ideas
by
the
road
of
argument
but
the
characters
are
chiefly
energies
through
whose
lips
gilbert
argues
with
gilbert
until
some
conclusion
shall
be
reached
in
came
club
of
queer
least
good
of
the
fantasia
and
even
admirers
have
begun
to
wonder
if
too
many
fields
are
being
tried
in
and
it
will
remain
a
moot
point
whether
the
or
the
is
chesterton
best
work
of
literary
criticism
the
is
the
more
popular
largely
because
dickens
is
the
more
popular
author
most
dickens
idolators
read
anything
about
their
idol
if
only
for
the
pleasure
of
the
quotations
and
no
dickens
idolator
could
fail
to
realise
that
here
was
one
even
more
rapt
in
worship
than
himself
after
the
publication
of
chesterton
undertook
a
series
of
prefaces
to
the
novels
in
one
of
them
he
took
the
trouble
to
answer
one
only
of
the
criticisms
the
book
had
produced
the
comment
that
he
was
reading
into
the
work
of
dickens
something
that
dickens
did
not
mean
criticism
does
not
exist
to
say
about
authors
the
things
that
they
knew
themselves
it
exists
to
say
the
things
about
them
which
they
did
not
know
themselves
if
a
critic
says
that
the
has
a
pagan
rather
than
a
christian
pity
or
that
it
is
full
of
pictures
made
by
one
epithet
of
course
he
does
not
mean
that
homer
could
have
said
that
if
homer
could
have
said
that
the
critic
would
leave
homer
to
say
it
the
function
of
criticism
if
it
has
a
legitimate
function
at
all
can
only
be
one
function
that
of
dealing
with
the
subconscious
part
of
the
author
mind
which
only
the
critic
can
express
and
not
with
the
conscious
part
of
the
author
mind
which
the
author
himself
can
express
either
criticism
is
no
good
at
all
a
very
defensible
position
or
else
criticism
means
saying
about
an
author
the
very
things
that
would
have

him

chesterton
had
said
that
every
postcard
dickens
wrote
was
a
work
of
art
but
dickens
died
on
june
and
the
first
british
postcard
was
issued
on
october
a
wonderful
instance
of
dickens
propensity
to
keep
ahead
of
his
age
after
all
what
did
such
things
matter
bernard
shaw
however
felt
that
they
did
he
wrote
a
letter
from
which
i
think
gilbert
got
an
important
hint
utilized
later
in
his
introduction
to
copperfield
september
dear
as
i
am
a
supersaturated
dickensite
i
pounced
on
your
book
and
read
it
as
wegg
read
gibbon
and
other
authors
right
slap
through
in
view
of
a
second
edition
let
me
hastily
note
for
you
one
or
two
matters
first
and
chiefly
a
fantastic
and
colossal
howler
in
the
best
manner
of
nickleby
and
flora
finching
there
is
an
association
in
your
mind
well
founded
between
the
quarrel
over
dickens
determination
to
explain
his
matrimonial
difficulty
to
the
public
and
the
firm
of
bradbury
and
evans
there
is
also
an
association
equally
well
founded
between
b
and
punch
they
were
the
publishers
of
punch
but
to
gravely
tell
the
xx
century
that
dickens
wanted
to
publish
his
explanation
in
punch
is
gas
and
gaiters
carried
to
an
incredible
pitch
of
absurdity
the
facts
are
b
were
the
publishers
of
household
words
they
objected
to
dickens
explaining
in
he
insisted
they
said
that
in
that
case
they
must
take
out
of
his
hands
dickens
like
a
lion
threatened
with
ostracism
by
a
louse
in
his
tail
published
his
explanation
which
stands
to
this
day
and
informed
his
readers
that
they
were
to
ask
in
future
not
for
household
words
but
for
all
the
year
round
household
words
left
dickensless
gasped
for
a
few
weeks
and
died
all
the
year
round
in
exactly
the
same
format
flourished
and
entered
largely
into
the
diet
of
my
youth
there
is
a
curious
contrast
between
dickens
sentimental
indiscretions
concerning
his
marriage
and
his
sorrows
and
quarrels
and
his
impenetrable
reserve
about
himself
as
displayed
in
his
published
correspondence
he
writes
to
his
family
about
waiters
about
hotels
about
screeching
tumblers
of
hot
brandy
and
water
and
about
the
seasick
man
in
the
next
berth
but
never
one
really
intimate
word
never
a
real
confession
of
his
soul
david
copperfield
is
a
failure
as
an
autobiography
because
when
he
comes
to
deal
with
the
david
you
find
that
he
has
not
the
slightest
intention
of
telling
you
the
truth
or
indeed
anything
about
himself
even
the
child
david
is
more
remarkable
for
the
reserves
than
for
the
revelations
he
falls
back
on
fiction
at
every
turn
clennam
and
pip
are
the
real
autobiographies
i
find
that
dickens
is
at
his
greatest
after
the
social
awakening
which
produced
little
dorrit
is
an
enormous
work
the
change
is
partly
the
disillusion
produced
by
the
unveiling
of
capitalist
civilization
but
partly
also
dickens
discovery
of
the
gulf
between
himself
as
a
man
of
genius
and
the
public
that
he
did
not
realize
this
early
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
found
out
his
wife
he
married
as
much
too
small
for
the
job
and
yet
plumbed
the
difference
so
inadequately
that
he
married
her
thinking
he
could
go
through
with
it
when
the
situation
became
intolerable
he
must
have
faced
the
fact
that
there
was
something
more
than
incompatibilities
between
him
and
the
average
man
and
woman
little
dorrit
is
written
like
all
the
later
books
frankly
and
somewhat
sadly
haut
en
in
them
dickens
recognizes
that
quite
everyday
men
are
as
grotesque
as
bunsby
sparkler
one
of
the
most
extravagant
of
all
his
gargoyles
is
an
untouched
photograph
almost
wegg
and
riderhood
are
sinister
and
terrifying
because
they
are
simply
real
which
squeers
and
sikes
are
not
and
please
remark
that
whilst
squeers
and
sikes
have
their
speeches
written
with
anxious
verisimilitude
comparatively
wegg
says
man
shrouds
and
grapple
venus
or
she
dies
and
riderhood
describes
lightwood
sherry
when
retracting
his
confession
as
i
will
not
say
a
hocussed
wine
but
a
wine
as
was
far
from
for
the
mind
dickens
does
care
what
he
makes
wegg
or
riderhood
or
sparkler
or
f
aunt
say
because
he
knows
them
and
has
got
them
and
knows
what
matters
and
what
does

are

swiveller

sometimes
trabbs

has
the
happier
touch
when
i
am
told
that
young
john
chivery
whose
epitaphs
you
ignore
whilst
quoting

would
have
gone
barefoot
through
the
prison
against
rules
for

had
it
been
paved
with

hot
ploughshares
i
am
not
so
affected
by

dickens
was
a
dead
man
before
he
began
it
collins
corrupted
him
with
plots
and
oh
the
philistinism
the
utter
detachment
from
the
great
human
heritage
of
art
and
philosophy
why
not
a
sermon
on
that
note
in
the
introduction
to
what
says
as
to
the
break
between
the
two
halves
of
the
book
he
calls
it
an
instance
of
weariness
in
dickens
a
solitary
instance
is
not
explanation
at
once
fascinating
and
probable
kate
perugini
the
daughter
of
dickens
wrote
two
letters
of
immense
enthusiasm
about
the
book
saying
it
was
the
best
thing
written
about
her
father
since
forster
biography
but
she
shatters
the
theory
put
forth
by
chesterton
that
dickens
thrown
into
intimacy
with
a
large
family
of
girls
fell
in
love
with
them
all
and
happened
unluckily
to
marry
the
wrong
sister
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
her
mother
the
eldest
of
the
sisters
was
only
eighteen
mary
between
fourteen
and
fifteen
very
young
and
childish
in
appearance
georgina
eight
and
helen
three
nothing
could
better
illustrate
the
clash
between
enthusiasm
and
despair
that
fills
a
chestertonian
while
reading
any
of
his
literary
biographies
for
so
much
is
built
on
this
theory
which
the
slightest
investigation
would
have
shown
to
be
baseless
aroused
animosity
in
many
minds
dealing
with
browning
or
dickens
a
man
may
encounter
literary
prejudices
or
enthusiasms
but
there
is
not
the
intensity
of
feeling
that
he
finds
when
he
gets
into
the
field
with
his
own
contemporaries
reviewers
who
had
been
extending
a
friendly
welcome
to
a
beginner
found
that
beginner
attacking
landmarks
in
the
world
of
letters
venturing
to
detest
ibsen
and
to
ask
william
archer
whether
he
hung
up
his
stocking
on
ibsen
birthday
accusing
kipling
of
lack
of
patriotism
it
is
said
one
angrily
unbecoming
to
spend
most
of
his
time
criticising
his
contemporaries
his
sense
of
mental
perspective
is
an
extremely
deficient
one
the
manufacture
of
paradoxes
is
really
one
of
the
simplest
processes
conceivable
chesterton
sententious
wisdom
in
fact
it
was
like
the
scene
in
napoleon
of
notting
when
most
people
present
were
purple
with
anger
but
an
intellectual
few
were
purple
with
laughter
and
even
now
most
of
the
reviewers
seemed
not
to
understand
where
stood
or
what
was
his
philosophy
bernard
shaw
says
one
whom
a
he
naturally
exalts
this
after
a
series
of
books
in
which
had
exposed
with
perfect
lucidity
and
a
wealth
of
examples
a
view
of
life
differing
from
shaw
in
almost
every
particular
one
reviewer
clearly
discerned
the
influence
of
shaw
in
napoleon
of
notting
but
without
a
trace
of
shaw
wonderful
humour
and
perspicacity

mccabe
and

frivolity
the
collection
was
a
heterogeneous
one
and
in
the
introduction
the
author
tells
us
he
is
not
concerned
with
any
of
these
men
as
a
brilliant
artist
or
a
vivid
personality
but
as
a
heretic
that
is
to
say
a
man
whose
view
of
things
has
the
hardihood
to
differ
from
mine
as
a
man
whose
philosophy
is
quite
solid
quite
coherent
and
quite
wrong
i
revert
to
the
doctrinal
methods
of
the
thirteenth
century
inspired
by
the
general
hope
of
getting
something
done
in
a
and
even
more
in
the
study
of
kipling
in
this
book
there
is
one
touch
of
inconsistency
which
we
shall
meet
with
again
in
his
later
work
he
hated
imperialism
yet
he
glorified
napoleon
himself
ardently
patriotic
he
accused
kipling
of
lack
of
patriotism
on
the
ground
that
a
man
could
not
at
once
love
england
and
love
the
empire
for
there
was
a
curious
note
in
the
of
the
chesterbelloc
that
has
not
always
been
recognised
the
ordinary
holds
that
england
has
no
right
to
govern
an
empire
and
that
her
leadership
is
bad
for
the
other
dominions
but
the
chesterbelloc
view
was
that
the
dominions
were
inferior
and
unworthy
of
a
european
england
the
phrase
suburbs
of
england
quoted
in
a
later
chapter
was
typical
but
kipling
was
thrilled
by
those
suburbs
and
chesterton
who
had
as
a
boy
admired
kipling
attacks
him
in
for
lack
of
patriotism
of
pook
was
not
yet
written
but
like
kipling
poem
on
sussex
it
expressed
a
patriotism
much
akin
to
gilbert
own
remember
the
man
who
returned
from
the
south
african
veldt
to
be
the
gardener
me
that
have
done
what
i
done
me
that
have
seen
what
i
seen
that
man
with
eyes
opened
to
a
sense
of
his
own
tragedy
was
speaking
for
chesterton
people
of
england
who
have
not
spoken
yet
yes
they
have
spoken
through
the
mouth
of
english
genius
as
langland
piers
plowman
as
dickens
sam
weller
but
not
least
as
kipling
tommy
atkins
it
was
a
pity
chesterton
was
deaf
to
this
last
voice
with
a
better
understanding
of
kipling
he
might
in
turn
have
made
kipling
understand
what
was
needed
to
make
england
merrie
england
once
again
have
given
him
the
philosophy
that
should
make
his
genius
fruitful
for
the
huge
distinction
between
chesterton
and
most
of
his
contemporaries
lay
not
in
the
wish
to
get
something
done
but
in
the
conviction
that
the
right
philosophy
alone
could
produce
fruitful
action
a
parable
in
the
introduction
shows
the
point
at
which
his
thinking
had
arrived
suppose
that
a
great
commotion
arises
in
the
street
about
something
let
us
say
a
which
many
influential
persons
desire
to
pull
down
a
monk
who
is
the
spirit
of
the
middle
ages
is
approached
upon
the
matter
and
begins
to
say
in
the
arid
manner
of
the
schoolmen
let
us
first
of
all
consider
my
brethren
the
value
of
light
if
light
be
in
itself
good
at
this
point
he
is
somewhat
excusably
knocked
down
all
the
people
make
a
rush
for
the
the
is
down
in
ten
minutes
and
they
go
about
congratulating
each
other
on
their
unmediaeval
practicality
but
as
things
go
on
they
do
not
work
out
so
easily
some
people
have
pulled
the
down
because
they
wanted
the
electric
light
some
because
they
wanted
old
iron
some
because
they
wanted
darkness
because
their
deeds
were
evil
some
thought
it
not
enough
of
a
some
too
much
some
acted
because
they
wanted
to
smash
municipal
machinery
some
because
they
wanted
to
smash
something
and
there
is
war
in
the
night
no
man
knowing
whom
he
strikes
so
gradually
and
inevitably
today
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
there
comes
back
the
conviction
that
the
monk
was
right
after
all
that
all
depends
on
what
is
the
philosophy
of
light
only
what
we
might
have
discussed
under
the
we
now
must
discuss
in
the
dark
pp
every
year
during
this
time

increasing

all
these
are
on
a
few
pages
of
his
father
collection
interspersed
with
clippings
recording
articles
in
reviews
innumerable
introductions
to
books
interviews
and
controversies
there
was
almost
no
element
of
choice
in
these
engagements
was
intensely
and
hated
saying
no
he
was
the
lion
of
the
moment
and
they
all
wanted
him
to
roar
for
them
in
spite
of
the
large
heading
lest
we
forget
that
met
his
eye
daily
in
the
he
did
forget
a
great
deal
in
fact
friends
say
he
forgot
any
engagement
made
when
frances
was
not
present
to
write
it
down
directly
it
was
made
she
had
to
do
memory
and
all
the
practical
side
of
life
for
him
there
might
have
been
one
slight
chance
of
making
gilbert
responsible
in
these
matters
that
chance
was
given
to
his
parents
and
by
them
thrown
away
how
far
it
is
even
possible
to
groom
and
train
a
genius
is
doubtful
anyhow
no
attempt
was
made
waited
on
hand
and
foot
by
his
mother
never
made
to
wash
or
brush
himself
as
a
child
personally
conducted
to
the
tailor
as
he
grew
older
given
by
his
parents
no
money
for
which
to
feel
responsible
not
made
to
keep
hours
how
could
frances
take
a
man
of
and
make
him
over
again
but
there
is
of
course
a
most
genuine
difficulty
in
all
this
which
gilbert
once
touched
on
when
he
denied
the
accusation
of
absence
of
mind
it
was
he
claimed
presence
of
mind
on
his
thoughts
that
made
him
unaware
of
much
else
and
indeed
no
man
can
be
using
his
mind
furiously
in
every
direction
at
once
anyone
who
has
done
even
a
little
creative
work
anyone
even
who
has
lived
with
people
who
do
creative
work
knows
the
sense
of
bewilderment
with
which
the
mind
comes
out
of
the
world
of
remoter
but
greater
reality
and
tries
to
adjust
with
that
daily
world
in
which
meals
are
to
be
ordered
letters
answered
and
engagements
kept
what
must
this
pain
of
adjustment
not
have
been
to
a
mind
almost
continuously
creative
for
i
have
never
known
anyone
work
such
long
hours
with
a
mind
at
such
tension
as
gilbert
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
he
should
have
written
his
article
for
the
as
the
reporter
writes
his
at
top
speed
at
a
late
hour
but
he
usually
did
the
writing
of
it
was
left
till
the
last
minute
and
if
at
home
he
would
need
frances
to
get
it
off
for
him
before
the
deadline
was
reached
but
he
often
wrote
by
preference
in
fleet
street
at
the
cheshire
cheese
or
some
little
pub
where
journalists
gathered
and
then
he
would
hire
a
cab
to
take
the
article
a
hundred
yards
or
so
to
the
office
the
cab
in
those
days
was
the
hansom
with
its
two
huge
wheels
over
which
one
perilously
ascended
while
the
driver
sat
above
only
to
be
communicated
with
by
opening
a
sort
of
trap
door
in
the
roof
gilbert
once
said
that
the
imaginative
englishman
in
paris
would
spend
his
days
in
a
café
the
imaginative
frenchman
in
london
would
spend
his
driving
in
a
hansom
in
the
the
thought
of
the
cab
moves
him
to
write
poet
whose
cunning
carved
this
amorous
cell
where
twain
may
dwell
lucas
his
daughter
tells
us
used
to
say
that
if
one
were
invited
to
drive
with
gilbert
in
a
hansom
cab
it
would
have
to
be
two
cabs
but
this
is
not
strictly
true
for
in
those
days
i
drove
with
gilbert
and
frances
too
in
a
hansom
he
and
i
side
by
side
she
on
his
knee
we
must
have
given
to
the
populace
the
impression
he
says
any
hansom
would
give
on
first
view
to
an
ancient
roman
or
a
simple
barbarian
that
the
driver
riding
on
high
and
flourishing
his
whip
was
a
conqueror
carrying
off
his
helpless
victims
like
the
buffers
at
the
veneering
election
he
spent
much
of
his
time
taking
cabs
and
getting
about
or
not
even
getting
about
in
them
but
leaving
them
standing
at
the
door
for
hours
on
end
calling
on
one
publisher
he
placed
in
his
hands
a
letter
that
gave
excellent
reasons
why
he
could
not
keep
the
engagement
the
memory
so
admirable
in
literary
quotations
was
not
merely
unreliable
for
engagements
but
even
for
such
matters
as
street
numbers
and
addresses
edward
macdonald
who
worked
with
him
later
on
relates
how
some
months
after
the
paper
had
changed
its
address
he
failed
one
day
to
turn
up
at
a
board
meeting
finally
he
appeared
with
an
explanation
on
calling
a
taxi
at
marylebone
he
realized
that
he
could
not
give
the
address
so
he
told
the
driver
to
take
him
to
fleet
street
there
as
his
memory
still
refused
to
help
he
stopped
the
taxi
outside
a
left
it
there
while
he
was
inside
and
ordering
a
cup
of
tea
began
to
turn
out
all
his
pockets
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
letter
or
a
proof
bearing
the
address
then
as
no
clue
could
be
found
he
told
the
driver
to
take
him
to
a
bookstall
that
stocked
the
paper
at
the
first
and
second
he
drew
blanks
but
at
the
third
bought
a
copy
of
his
own
paper
and
thus
discovered
the
address
i
am
not
sure
at
what
date
he
began
to
hate
writing
anything
by
hand
my
mother
treasured
two
handwritten
letters
i
have
none
after
a
friendship
of
close
on
thirty
years
but
i
remember
on
his
first
visit
to
my
parents
home
in
surrey
his
calling
frances
that
he
might
dictate
an
article
to
her
his
writing
was
pictorial
and
rather
elaborate
he
drew
his
signature
rather
than
writing
it
says
edward
macdonald
who
remembers
him
saying
as
he
signed
a
cheque
many
a
curve
my
banks
i
fret
i
wonder
if
tennyson
fretted
his
at
one
of
our
earliest
meetings
i
asked
him
to
write
in
my
autograph
book
it
was
at
least
five
years
before
the
of
the
white
appeared
but
the
lines
may
be
found
almost
unchanged
in
the
ballad
verses
made
up
in
a
dream
which
you
wo
believe
people
if
you
have
any
prayers
say
prayers
for
me
and
bury
me
underneath
a
stone
in
the
stones
of
battersea
bury
me
underneath
a
stone
with
the
sword
that
was
my
own
to
wait
till
the
holy
horn
is
blown
and
all
poor
men
are
free
the
dream
went
on
he
said
for
pages
and
pages
and
i
think
frances
was
anxious
for
the
mind
must
find
rest
in
sleep
the
little
flat
at
battersea
was
a
vortex
of
requests
and
engagements
broken
promises
and
promises
fulfilled
author
ink
and
printer
ink
speeches
in
prospect
and
speeches
in

and
social
occasions
a
sincere
admirer
wrote
during
this
period
of
his
fears
of
too
great
a
strain
on
his
hero
and
from
to
the
only
change
was
an
increase
of
pressure
i
see
that
chesterton
has
just
issued
a
volume
on
the
art
of
watts
his
novel
was
published
yesterday
soon
his
monograph
on
kingsley
should
be
ready
i
believe
he
has
a
book
on
some
modern
aspects
of
religious
belief
in
the
press
he
is
of
the
illustrated
booklets
on
great
authors
issued
by
the
bookman
he
is
contributing
prefaces
and
introductions
to
odd
volumes
in
several
series
of
reprints
he
is
a
constant
contributor
to
the
and
the
he
is
conducting
a
public
controversy
with
blatchford
of
the
on
atheism
and
he
is
constantly
lecturing
and
debating
and
dining
out
it
is
almost
impossible
to
open
a
paper
that
does
not
contain
either
an
article
or
review
or
poem
or
drawing
of
his
and
his
name
is
better
known
now
to
compositors
than
bernard
shaw
now
both
physically
and
mentally
chesterton
is
a
hercules
and
from
what
i
hear
of
his
methods
of
work
he
is
capable
of
a
great
output
without
much
physical
strain
nevertheless
it
is
clear
i
think
to
anyone
that
at
his
present
rate
of
production
he
must
either
wear
or
tear
no
man
born
can
keep
so
many
irons
in
the
fire
and
not
himself
come
between
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
it
is
a
pitiable
thing
to
have
a
good
man
spend
himself
so
recklessly
and
i
repeat
once
more
that
if
he
and
his
friends
have
not
the
will
or
power
to
restrain
him
then
there
should
be
a
conspiracy
of
editors
and
publishers
in
his
favour
not
often
is
a
man
like
chesterton
born
he
should
have
his
full
chance
and
that
can
only
come
by
study
and
meditation
and
by
slow
steady
accumulation
of
knowledge
and
wisdom
shan
bullock
in
the
evening
april
in
a
volume
made
up
of
introductions
written
at
this
time
to
individual
novels
of
dickens
we
find
a
passage
that
might
well
be
gilbert
summary
of
his
own
life
the
calls
upon
him
at
this
time
were
insistent
and
overwhelming
this
necessarily
happens
at
a
certain
stage
of
a
successful
career
he
was
just
successful
enough
to
invite
others
and
not
successful
enough
to
reject
them
there
was
almost
too
much
work
for
his
imagination
and
yet
not
quite
enough
work
for
his
housekeeping
and
it
is
a
curious
tribute
to
the
quite
curious
greatness
of
dickens
that
in
this
period
of
youthful
strain
we
do
not
feel
the
strain
but
feel
only
the
youth
his
own
amazing
wish
to
write
equalled
or
outstripped
even
his
readers
amazing
wish
to
read
working
too
hard
did
not
cure
him
of
his
abstract
love
of
work
unreasonable
publishers
asked
him
to
write
ten
novels
at
once
but
he
wanted
to
write
twenty
novels
at
once
thus
too
with
gilbert
the
first
eight
years
of
his
married
life
saw
in
swift
succession
the
publication
of
ten
books
comprising
literary
and
art
criticism
and
biography
poetry
fiction
or
rather
fantasy
light
essays
and
religious
philosophy
all
these
were
so
full
at
once
of
the
profound
seriousness
of
youth
and
of
the
bubbling
wine
of
its
high
spirits
as
to
recall
another
thing
gilbert
said
that
dickens
was
accused
of
superficiality
by
those
who
can
not
grasp
that
there
is
foam
upon
deep
seas
that
was
the
matter
in
dispute
about
himself
and
very
furiously
disputed
it
was
during
these
years
was
serious
or
merely
posing
was
he
a
great
man
or
a
mountebank
was
he
clear
or
obscure
was
he
a
genius
or
a
charlatan
audacious
reconciliation
he
pleaded
or
rather
asserted
for
his
tone
could
seldom
be
called
a
plea
is
a
mark
not
of
frivolity
but
of
extreme
seriousness
a
man
who
deals
in
harmonies
who
only
matches
stars
with
angels
or
lambs
with
spring
flowers
he
indeed
may
be
frivolous
for
he
is
taking
one
mood
at
a
time
and
perhaps
forgetting
each
mood
as
it
passes
but
a
man
who
ventures
to
combine
an
angel
and
an
octopus
must
have
some
serious
view
of
the
universe
the
man
who
should
write
a
dialogue
between
two
early
christians
might
be
a
mere
writer
of
dialogues
but
a
man
who
should
write
a
dialogue
between
an
early
christian
and
the
missing
link
would
have
to
be
a
philosopher
the
more
widely
different
the
types
talked
of
the
more
serious
and
universal
must
be
the
philosophy
which
talks
of
them
the
mark
of
the
light
and
thoughtless
writer
is
the
harmony
of
his
subject
matter
the
mark
of
the
thoughtful
writer
is
its
apparent
diversity
the
most
flippant
lyric
poet
might
write
a
pretty
poem
about
lambs
but
it
requires
something
bolder
and
graver
than
a
poet
it
requires
an
ecstatic
prophet
to
talk
about
the
lion
lylng
down
with
the
lamb
chesterton
and
appreciations
of
the
world
of
charles
dent
pp
a
man
starting
to
write
a
thesis
on
chesterton
sociology
once
complained
bitterly
that
almost
none
of
his
books
were
indexed
so
he
had
to
submit
to
the
disgusting
necessity
of
reading
them
all
through
for
some
striking
view
on
sociology
might
well
be
embedded
in
a
volume
of
art
criticism
or
be
the
very
centre
of
a
fantastic
romance
chesterton
was
a
philosophy
universal
and
unified
and
it
was
at
this
time
growing
fast
and
finding
exceedingly
varied
techniques
of
expression
but
the
whole
of
it
was
in
a
sense
in
each
of
them
in
each
book
almost
in
each
poem
as
he
himself
says
of
the
universe
of
charles
dickens
there
was
something
in
it
there
is
in
all
great
creative
writers
like
the
account
in
genesis
of
the
light
being
created
before
the
sun
moon
and
stars
the
idea
before
the
machinery
that
made
it
manifest
pickwick
is
in
dickens
career
the
mere
mass
of
light
before
the
creation
of
sun
or
moon
it
is
the
splendid
shapeless
substance
of
which
all
his
stars
are
ultimately
made
and
again
he
said
what
he
had
to
say
and
yet
not
all
he
had
to
say
wild
pictures
possible
stories
tantalising
and
attractive
trains
of
thought
perspectives
of
adventure
crowded
so
continually
upon
his
mind
that
at
the
end
there
was
a
vast
mass
of
them
left
over
ideas
that
he
literally
had
not
the
opportunity
to
develop
tales
that
he
literally
had
not
the
time
to
tell
chapter
xii
clearing
the
ground
for
orthodoxy
chesterton
a
criticism
published
anonymously
in
was
a
challenge
thrown
to
the
world
of
letters
for
it
demanded
the
recognition
of
chesterton
as
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
in
the
modern
world
as
its
title
implied
the
book
was
by
no
means
a
tribute
of
sheer
admiration
and
agreement
gilbert
was
rebuked
for
that
love
of
a
pun
or
an
effective
phrase
that
sometimes
led
him
into
indefensible
positions
it
was
hotly
asked
of
him
that
he
should
abandon
his
unjust
attitude
toward
ibsen
he
was
accused
of
calling
himself
a
liberal
and
being
in
fact
a
tory
but
even
in
differing
from
him
the
book
showed
him
as
of
real
importance
not
least
in
the
sketch
given
of
his
life
and
of
the
influences
that
had
contributed
to
the
formation
of
his
mind
it
did
too
another
thing
it
clarified
his
philosophical
position
for
the
world
at
large
for
some
time
now
many
had
been
demanding
such
a
clarification
when
attacked
the
utopia
of
wells
and
of
shaw
both
wells
and
shaw
had
been
urgent
in
their
demands
that
he
should
play
fair
by
setting
forth
his
own
utopia
when
he
attacked
the
fundamental
philosophy
of
street
street
retorted
that
it
would
be
time
for
him
to
worry
about
his
philosophy
when
had
been
unfolded
retort
to
this
was
chesterton
a
far
the
best
book
that
has
ever
been
written
about
chesterton
showed
at
last
a
mind
that
had
really
grasped
his
philosophy
and
could
even
have
outlined
his
utopia
perhaps
this
was
the
less
surprising
as
it
ultimately
turned
out
to
have
been
written
by
his
brother
cecil
i
do
not
know
at
what
stage
cecil
revealed
his
authorship
but
i
remember
that
at
first
frances
told
me
only
that
they
suspected
cecil
because
it
was
from
the
angle
of
his
opinions
that
the
book
criticised
many
of
gilbert
however
i
was
at
that
date
only
an
acquaintance
and
the
truth
may
still
have
been
a
family
secret
at
any
rate
cecil
it
was
and
it
is
small
wonder
if
after
all
those
years
of
arguing
he
understood
something
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
been
measuring
forces
but
he
did
better
than
that
for
he
explained
him
to
others
without
ever
having
resort
to
these
arguments
which
after
all
were
more
or
less
private
property
he
explained
general
philosophy
from
the
his
ideas
of
cosmic
good
from
wild
and
man
who
was
which
had
just
been
published
that
same
year
in
this
last
fantastic
story
the
group
of
anarchists
distinguished
by
being
called
after
the
days
of
the
week
turn
out
through
a
series
of
incredible
adventures
to
be
all
save
one
detectives
in
disguise
the
gigantic
figure
of
sunday
before
whom
they
all
tremble
turns
from
the
chief
of
the
anarchists
chief
of
the
destructive
forces
into
what
the
a
nightmare
is
needed
for
sunday
would
seem
to
be
some
wild
vision
seen
in
dreams
not
merely
of
forces
of
good
of
sanity
of
creation
but
even
of
god
himself
when
almost
twenty
years
later
man
who
was
was
adapted
for
the
stage
chesterton
said
in
an
interview
by
ralph
neale
and
cecil
chesterton
in
an
ordinary
detective
tale
the
investigator
discovers
that
some
fellow
who
subscribes
to
all
the
charities
and
is
fond
of
animals
has
murdered
his
grandmother
or
is
a
trigamist
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
make
the
tearing
away
of
menacing
masks
reveal
benevolence
associated
with
that
merely
fantastic
notion
was
the
one
that
there
is
actually
a
lot
of
good
to
be
discovered
in
unlikely
places
and
that
we
who
are
fighting
each
other
may
be
all
fighting
on
the
right
side
i
think
it
is
quite
true
that
it
is
just
as
well
we
do
not
while
the
fight
is
on
know
all
about
each
other
the
soul
must
be
solitary
or
there
would
be
no
place
for
courage
a
rather
amusing
thing
was
said
by
father
knox
on
this
point
he
said
that
he
should
have
regarded
the
book
as
entirely
pantheist
and
as
preaching
that
there
was
good
in
everything
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
introduction
of
the
one
real
anarchist
and
pessimist
but
he
was
prepared
to
wager
that
if
the
book
survives
for
a
hundred
years
which
it
wo
they
will
say
that
the
real
anarchist
was
put
in
afterwards
by
the
priests
but
though
i
was
more
foggy
about
ethical
and
theological
matters
than
i
am
now
i
was
quite
clear
on
that
issue
that
there
was
a
final
adversary
and
that
you
might
find
a
man
resolutely
turned
away
from
goodness
people
have
asked
me
whom
i
mean
by
sunday
well
i
think
on
the
whole
and
allowing
for
the
fact
that
he
is
a
person
in
a
tale
i
think
you
can
take
him
to
stand

called
man
who
was
an
extraordinary
book
written
as
if
the
publisher
had
commissioned
him
to
write
something
rather
like
the
pilgrim
progress
in
the
style
of
the
pickwick
papers
which
explains
perhaps
why
some
reviewers
called
it
irreverent
the
very
wildness
of
it
conveys
a
sense
of
thoughts
seething
and
straining
in
an
effort
to
express
the
inexpressible
later
in
his
more
definitely
philosophical
books
could
say
calmly
much
that
here
he
splashes
on
a
ten
leagued
canvas
with
brushes
of
comet
hair
with
all
the
violent
directness
of
a
vision
in

of
that
vision
his
brother
began
the

challenging

for
even
those
who
wanted
most
ardently
to
say
that
cecil

should
not
have
been

found
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
it
loudly
and
to
say
it
at
great
length
their
very
violence
showed
their
sense
of
chesterton
as
a
peril
even
when
they
abused
anyone
who
felt
him
to
be
a
portent
it
was
not
the
kind
of
contempt
that
is
really
bestowed
on
the
contemptible
the
expended
more

columns

leave

and

lancelot
bathurst
had
also
dared
to
write
of
in
his
daily
life
as
a
journalist
so
the
article
goes
on
let
us
kneel
with
the
hon
lancelot
at
his
greasy
shrine
what
time
the
jingling
hansom
waits
us
with
its
rolling
occupant
and
his
and
his
revolver
and
his
pockets
stacked
with
penny
dreadfuls
the
fact
is
we
have
in
chesterton
the
true
product
of
the
deboshed
hapenny
press
if
the
hapenny
papers
ceased
to
notice
him
forthwith
it
seems
to
us
more
than
probable
that
he
would
cease
at
once
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
in
literary
circles
and
the
bishops
and
members
of
parliament
who
have
honoured
him
with
their
kind
notice
would
be
compelled
to
drop
him
most
of
the
reviews
were
very
different
from
this
one
which
is
certainly
great
fun
although
some
few
other
reviewers
suggested
that
gilbert
himself
wrote
the
i
have
wondered
whether
the
notices
of
his
own
books
all
much
like
this
were
written
by
a
personal
enemy
or
merely
by
one
of
the
jolly
people
as
he
often
called
them
who
were
maddened
by
his
views
for
some
years
now
gilbert
had
been
gathering
in
his
mind
the
material
for
some
of
the
ideas
we
have
seen
faintly
traced
in
the
notebook
and
coloured
but
they
all
grew
to
maturity
in
the
atmosphere
of
constant
controversy
in
a
controversy
with
the
rev
campbell
we
see
for
instance
his
convictions
about
the
reality
of
sin
shaping
under
our
eyes
discussing
modernism
in
the
he
analyses
the
difference
between
the
true
development
of
an
idea
and
the
mere
changing
from
one
idea
to
another
modernism
claiming
to
be
a
development
was
actually
an
abandonment
of
the
christian
idea
for
the
catholic
this
is
among
the
most
interesting
of
his
controversies
in
the
course
of
it
he
refers
to
the
earlier
works
of
newman
and
the
literature
of
the
oxford
movement
to
support
his
view
of
the
anglican
position
i
have
already
said
that
chesterton
read
far
more
than
was
usually
supposed
because
he
read
so
quickly
and
with
so
little
parade
of
learning
and
it
has
been
too
lightly
assumed
that
the
statement
in
that
he
avoided
works
of
christian
apologetic
meant
that
he
had
not
read
any
of
the
great
christian
writers
of
the
past
true
he
was
not
then
or
at
any
time
reading
books
of
apologetic
he
must
however
have
been
reading
something
more
as
we
learn
from
a
single
hint
asked
to
draw
up
a
scheme
of
reading
for
in
he
suggests
butler
coleridge
of
an
enquiring
newman
augustine
and
the
of
thomas
aquinas
it
was
absurd
he
said
in
this
article
to
suppose
that
the
ancients
did
not
see
our
modern
problems
the
truth
was
that
the
great
ancients
not
only
saw
them
but
saw
through
them
butler
had
sketched
the
real
line
along
which
christianity
must
ultimately
be
defended
these
great
writers
all
remained
modern
while
the
new
theology
takes
one
back
to
the
time
of
crinolines
i
almost
expect
to
see
campbell
in
trousers
with
very
long
in
this
controversy
although
not
yet
a
catholic
he
showed
the
gulf
between
the
modernist
theory
of
development
and
the
newman
doctrine
with
a
clarity
greater
than
any
catholic
writer
of
the
time
a
man
who
is
always
going
back
and
picking
to
pieces
his
own
first
principles
may
be
having
an
amusing
time
but
he
is
not
developing
as
newman
understood
development
newman
meant
that
if
you
wanted
a
tree
to
grow
you
must
plant
it
finally
in
some
definite
spot
it
may
be
i
do
not
know
and
i
do
not
care
that
catholic
christianity
is
just
now
passing
through
one
of
its
numberless
periods
of
undue
repression
and
silence
but
i
do
know
this
that
when
the
great
powers
break
forth
again
the
new
epics
and
the
new
arts
they
will
break
out
on
the
ancient
and
living
tree
they
can
not
break
out
upon
the
little
shrubs
that
you
are
always
pulling
up
by
the
roots
to
see
if
they
are
growing
against
campbell
he
showed
in
a
lecture
on
christianity
and
social
reform
how
belief
in
sin
as
well
as
in
goodness
was
more
favourable
to
social
reform
than
was
the
rather
woolly
optimism
that
refused
to
recognize
evil
the
will
be
delighted
to
hear
that
god
is
immanent
in
him
the
sweater
that
he
has
not
in
any
way
become
divided
from
the
supreme
perfection
of
the
universe
if
the
new
theology
would
not
lead
to
social
reform
the
social
utopia
to
which
the
philosophy
of
wells
and
of
shaw
was
pointing
seemed
to
chesterton
not
a
heaven
on
earth
to
be
desired
but
a
kind
of
final
hell
to
be
avoided
since
it
banished
all
freedom
and
human
responsibility
arguing
with
them
was
again
highly
fruitful
and
two
subjects
he
chose
for
speeches
are
suggestive
the
terror
of
tendencies
and
shall
we
abolish
the
inevitable
in
the
shaw
wrote
about
belloc
and
chesterton
and
so
did
wells
while
chesterton
wrote
about
wells
and
shaw
till
the
philistines
grew
angry
called
it
and
and
urged
that
a
bill
for
the
abolition
of
shaw
and
chesterton
should
be
introduced
into
parliament
but
had
no
need
for
advertisement
of
himself
or
his
ideas
just
then
he
had
a
platform
he
had
an
eager
audience
every
week
he
wrote
in
the
london
beginning
in
to
do
our
notebook
this
continued
till
his
death
in
he
was
still
writing
every
saturday
in
the
publishers
were
disputing
for
each
of
his
books
yet
he
rushed
into
every
religious
controversy
that
was
going
on
because
thereby
he
could
clarify
and
develop
his
ideas
the
most
important
of
all
these
was
the
controversy
with
blatchford
editor
of
the
who
had
written
a
rationalist
credo
entitled
and
my
in
he
had
the
generosity
and
the
wisdom
to
throw
open
the
to
the
freest
possible
discussion
of
his
views
the
christian
attack
was
made
by
a
group
of
which
chesterton
was
the
outstanding
figure
and
was
afterwards
gathered
into
a
paper
volume
called
doubts
of
one
essay
in
this
volume
written
in
is
of
primary
importance
in
any
study
of
the
sources
of
for
it
gives
a
brilliant
outline
of
one
of
the
main
contentions
of
the
book
and
shows
even
better
than
itself
what
he
meant
by
saying
that
he
had
first
learnt
christianity
from
its
opponents
it
is
clear
that
by
now
he
believed
in
the
divinity
of
christ
the
pamphlet
itself
has
fallen
into
oblivion
and
chesterton
share
of
it
was
only
three
short
essays
i
think
it
well
to
quote
a
good
deal
from
the
first
of
these
because
in
it
he
has
put
in
concentrated
form
and
with
different
illustrations
what
he
developed
five
years
later
there
is
nothing
more
packed
with
thought
in
the
whole
of
his
writings
than
these
essays
the
first
of
all
the
difficulties
that
i
have
in
controverting
blatchford
is
simply
this
that
i
shall
be
very
largely
going
over
his
own
ground
my
favourite
of
theology
is
and
my
but
i
can
not
repeat
it
in
detail
if
i
gave
each
of
my
reasons
for
being
a
christian
a
vast
number
of
them
would
be
blatchford
reasons
for
not
being
one
for
instance
blatchford
and
his
school
point
out
that
there
are
many
myths
parallel
to
the
christian
story
that
there
were
pagan
christs
and
red
indian
incarnations
and
patagonian
crucifixions
for
all
i
know
or
care
but
does
not
blatchford
see
the
other
side
of
the
fact
if
the
christian
god
really
made
the
human
race
would
not
the
human
race
tend
to
rumours
and
perversions
of
the
christian
god
if
the
centre
of
our
life
is
a
certain
fact
would
not
people
far
from
the
centre
have
a
muddled
version
of
that
fact
if
we
are
so
made
that
a
son
of
god
must
deliver
us
is
it
odd
that
patagonians
should
dream
of
a
son
of
god
the
blatchfordian
position
really
amounts
to
this
that
because
a
certain
thing
has
impressed
millions
of
different
people
as
likely
or
necessary
therefore
it
can
not
be
true
and
then
this
bashful
being
veiling
his
own
talents
convicts
the
wretched
of
paradox
the
story
of
a
christ
is
very
common
in
legend
and
literature
so
is
the
story
of
two
lovers
parted
by
fate
so
is
the
story
of
two
friends
killing
each
other
for
a
woman
but
will
it
seriously
be
maintained
that
because
these
two
stories
are
common
as
legends
therefore
no
two
friends
were
ever
separated
by
love
or
no
two
lovers
by
circumstances
it
is
tolerably
plain
surely
that
these
two
stories
are
common
because
the
situation
is
an
intensely
probable
and
human
one
because
our
nature
is
so
built
as
to
make
them
almost
inevitable
thus
in
this
first
instance
when
learned
sceptics
come
to
me
and
say
are
you
aware
that
the
kaffirs
have
a
sort
of
incarnation
i
should
reply
speaking
as
an
unlearned
person
i
do
know
but
speaking
as
a
christian
i
should
be
very
much
astonished
if
they
had
take
a
second
instance
the
secularist
says
that
christianity
has
been
a
gloomy
and
ascetic
thing
and
points
to
the
procession
of
austere
or
ferocious
saints
who
have
given
up
home
and
happiness
and
macerated
health
and
sex
but
it
never
seems
to
occur
to
him
that
the
very
oddity
and
completeness
of
these
men
surrender
make
it
look
very
much
as
if
there
were
really
something
actual
and
solid
in
the
thing
for
which
they
sold
themselves
they
gave
up
all
pleasures
for
one
pleasure
of
spiritual
ecstasy
they
may
have
been
mad
but
it
looks
as
if
there
really
were
such
a
pleasure
they
gave
up
all
human
experiences
for
the
sake
of
one
superhuman
experience
they
may
have
been
wicked
but
it
looks
as
if
there
were
such
an
experience
it
is
perfectly
tenable
that
this
experience
is
as
dangerous
and
selfish
a
thing
as
drink
a
man
who
goes
ragged
and
homeless
in
order
to
see
visions
may
be
as
repellant
and
immoral
as
a
man
who
goes
ragged
and
homeless
in
order
to
drink
brandy
that
is
a
quite
reasonable
position
but
what
is
manifestly
not
a
reasonable
position
what
would
be
in
fact
not
far
from
being
an
insane
position
would
be
to
say
that
the
raggedness
of
the
man
and
the
stupefied
degradation
of
the
man
proved
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
brandy
that
is
precisely
what
the
secularist
tries
to
say
he
tries
to
prove
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
supernatural
experience
by
pointing
at
the
people
who
have
given
up
everything
for
it
he
tries
to
prove
that
there
is
no
such
thing
by
proving
that
there
are
people
who
live
on
nothing
else
again
i
may
submissively
ask
whose
is
the
paradox
take
a
third
instance
the
secularist
says
that
christianity
produced
tumult
and
cruelty
he
seems
to
suppose
that
this
proves
it
to
be
bad
but
it
might
prove
it
to
be
very
good
for
men
commit
crimes
not
only
for
bad
things
far
more
often
for
good
things
for
no
bad
things
can
be
desired
quite
so
passionately
and
persistently
as
good
things
can
be
desired
and
only
very
exceptional
men
desire
very
bad
and
unnatural
things
most
crime
is
committed
because
owing
to
some
peculiar
complication
very
beautiful
or
necessary
things
are
in
some
danger
and
when
something
is
set
before
mankind
that
is
not
only
enormously
valuable
but
also
quite
new
the
sudden
vision
the
chance
of
winning
it
the
chance
of
losing
it
drive
them
mad
it
has
the
same
effect
in
the
moral
world
that
the
finding
of
gold
has
in
the
economic
world
it
upsets
values
and
creates
a
kind
of
cruel
rush
we
need
not
go
far
for
instances
quite
apart
from
the
instances
of
religion
when
the
modern
doctrines
of
brotherhood
and
liberality
were
preached
in
france
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
time
was
ripe
for
them
the
educated
classes
everywhere
had
been
growing
towards
them
the
world
to
a
very
considerable
extent
welcomed
them
and
yet
all
that
preparation
and
openness
were
unable
to
prevent
the
burst
of
anger
and
agony
which
greets
anything
good
and
if
the
slow
and
polite
preaching
of
rational
fraternity
in
a
rational
age
ended
in
the
massacres
of
september
what
an
is
here
what
would
be
likely
to
be
the
effect
of
the
sudden
dropping
into
a
dreadfully
evil
century
of
a
dreadfully
perfect
truth
what
would
happen
if
a
world
baser
than
the
world
of
sade
were
confronted
with
a
gospel
purer
than
the
gospel
of
rousseau
the
mere
flinging
of
the
polished
pebble
of
republican
idealism
into
the
artificial
lake
of
eighteenth
century
europe
produced
a
splash
that
seemed
to
splash
the
heavens
and
a
storm
that
drowned
ten
thousand
men
what
would
happen
if
a
star
from
heaven
really
fell
into
the
slimy
and
bloody
pool
of
a
hopeless
and
decaying
humanity
men
swept
a
city
with
the
guillotine
a
continent
with
a
sabre
because
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
were
too
precious
to
be
lost
how
if
christianity
was
yet
more
maddening
because
it
was
yet
more
precious
but
why
should
we
labour
the
point
when
one
who
knew
human
nature
as
it
can
really
be
learnt
from
fishermen
and
women
and
natural
people
saw
from
his
quiet
village
the
track
of
this
truth
across
history
and
in
saying
that
he
came
to
bring
not
peace
but
a
sword
set
up
eternally
his
colossal
realism
against
the
eternal
sentimentality
of
the
secularist
thus
then
in
the
third
instance
when
the
learned
sceptic
says
christianity
produced
wars
and
persecutions
we
shall
reply
naturally
and
lastly
let
me
take
an
example
which
leads
me
on
directly
to
the
general
matter
i
wish
to
discuss
for
the
remaining
space
of
the
articles
at
my
command
the
secularist
constantly
points
out
that
the
hebrew
and
christian
religions
began
as
local
things
that
their
god
was
a
tribal
god
that
they
gave
him
material
form
and
attached
him
to
particular
places
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
one
of
the
things
that
if
i
were
conducting
a
detailed
campaign
i
should
use
as
an
argument
for
the
validity
of
biblical
experience
for
if
there
really
are
some
other
and
higher
beings
than
ourselves
and
if
they
in
some
strange
way
at
some
emotional
crisis
really
revealed
themselves
to
rude
poets
or
dreamers
in
very
simple
times
that
these
rude
people
should
regard
the
revelation
as
local
and
connect
it
with
the
particular
hill
or
river
where
it
happened
seems
to
me
exactly
what
any
reasonable
human
being
would
expect
it
has
a
far
more
credible
look
than
if
they
had
talked
cosmic
philosophy
from
the
beginning
if
they
had
i
should
have
suspected
priestcraft
and
forgeries
and
gnosticism
if
there
be
such
a
being
as
god
and
he
can
speak
to
a
child
and
if
god
spoke
to
a
child
in
the
garden
the
child
would
of
course
say
that
god
lived
in
the
garden
i
should
not
think
it
any
less
likely
to
be
true
for
that
if
the
child
said
god
is
everywhere
an
impalpable
essence
pervading
and
supporting
all
constituents
of
the
cosmos
alike
if
i
say
the
infant
addressed
me
in
the
above
terms
i
should
think
he
was
much
more
likely
to
have
been
with
the
governess
than
with
god
so
if
moses
had
said
god
was
an
infinite
energy
i
should
be
certain
he
had
seen
nothing
extraordinary
as
he
said
he
was
a
burning
bush
i
think
it
very
likely
that
he
did
see
something
extraordinary
for
whatever
be
the
divine
secret
and
whether
or
no
it
has
as
all
people
have
believed
sometimes
broken
bounds
and
surged
into
our
world
at
least
it
lies
on
the
side
furthest
away
from
pedants
and
their
definitions
and
nearest
to
the
silver
souls
of
quiet
people
to
the
beauty
of
bushes
and
the
love
of
native
place
thus
then
in
our
last
instance
out
of
hundreds
that
might
be
taken
we
conclude
in
the
same
way
when
the
learned
sceptic
says
the
visions
of
the
old
testament
were
local
and
rustic
and
grotesque
we
shall
answer
of
course
they
were
genuine
thus
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
i
find
myself
to
start
with
face
to
face
with
the
difficulty
that
to
mention
the
reasons
that
i
have
for
believing
in
christianity
is
in
very
many
cases
simply
to
repeat
those
arguments
which
blatchford
in
some
strange
way
seems
to
regard
as
arguments
against
it
his
book
is
really
rich
and
powerful
he
has
undoubtedly
set
up
these
four
great
guns
of
which
i
have
spoken
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
the
size
and
ammunition
of
the
guns
i
only
say
that
by
some
strange
accident
of
arrangement
he
has
set
up
those
four
pieces
of
artillery
pointing
at
himself
if
i
were
not
so
humane
i
should
say
gentlemen
of
the
secularist
guard
fire
first
he
goes
on
in
the
next
essay
to
talk
of
the
positive
arguments
for
christianity
of
this
religious
philosophy
which
was
and
will
be
again
the
study
of
the
highest
intellects
and
the
foundation
of
the
strongest
nations
but
which
our
little
civilisation
has
for
a
while
forgotten
very
briefly
he
then
deals
with
determinism
and
freewill
the
need
for
the
supernatural
and
the
question
of
the
fall
dealing
with
the
fall
he
uses
one
of
his
most
brilliant
illustrations
we
speak
he
says
of
a
manly
man
but
not
of
a
whaley
whale
if
you
wanted
to
dissuade
a
man
from
drinking
his
tenth
whisky
you
would
slap
him
on
the
back
and
say
a
man
no
one
who
wished
to
dissuade
a
crocodile
from
eating
his
tenth
explorer
would
slap
it
on
the
back
and
say
a
crocodile
for
we
have
no
notion
of
a
perfect
crocodile
no
allegory
of
a
whale
expelled
from
his
whaley
eden
continuing
the
swift
sketch
of
some
elements
of
christian
theology
chesterton
next
deals
with
miracles
while
the
development
in
makes
this
section
look
very
slight
there
are
passages
that
make
one
realize
the
mental
wealth
of
a
man
who
could
afford
to
leave
them
behind
and
rush
on
blatchford
had
said
that
no
english
judge
would
accept
the
evidence
for
the
resurrection
and
answers
that
possibly
christians
have
not
all
got
such
an
extravagant
reverence
for
english
judges
as
is
felt
by
blatchford
himself
the
experiences
of
the
founder
of
christianity
have
perhaps
left
us
in
a
vague
doubt
of
the
infallibility
of
courts
of
law
in
reference
to
the
many
rationalists
whose
refusal
to
accept
any
miracle
is
based
on
the
fact
that
experience
is
against
it
he
says
there
was
a
great
irish
rationalist
of
this
school
who
when
he
was
told
that
a
witness
had
seen
him
commit
a
murder
said
that
he
could
bring
a
hundred
witnesses
who
had
not
seen
him
commit
it
the
final
essay
on
the
eternal
heroism
of
the
slums
has
two
main
points
it
begins
with
an
acknowledgment
of
the
crimes
of
christians
only
pointing
out
that
while
blatchford
outlaws
the
church
for
this
reason
he
is
prepared
to
invoke
the
state
whose
crimes
are
far
worse
but
the
most
vigorous
part
of
the
essay
is
a
furious
attack
on
determinism
blatchford
apparently
held
that
bad
surroundings
inevitably
produced
bad
men
chesterton
had
seen
the
heroism
of
the
poor
in
the
most
evil
surroundings
and
was
furious
at
this
association
of
vice
with
poverty
the
vilest
and
the
oldest
and
the
dirtiest
of
all
the
stories
that
insolence
has
ever
flung
against
the
poor
men
can
and
do
lead
heroic
lives
in
the
worst
of
circumstances
because
there
is
in
humanity
a
power
of
responsibility
there
is
freewill
blatchford
in
the
name
of
humanity
is
attacking
the
greatest
of
human
attributes
more
numerous
than
can
be
counted
in
all
the
wars
and
persecutions
of
the
world
men
have
looked
out
of
their
little
grated
windows
and
said
at
least
my
thoughts
are
free
no
no
says
the
face
of
blatchford
suddenly
appearing
at
the
window
your
thoughts
are
the
inevitable
result
of
heredity
and
environment
your
thoughts
are
as
material
as
your
dungeons
your
thoughts
are
as
mechanical
as
the
guillotine
so
pants
this
strange
comforter
from
cell
to
cell
i
suppose
blatchford
would
say
that
in
his
utopia
nobody
would
be
in
prison
what
do
i
care
whether
i
am
in
prison
or
no
if
i
have
to
drag
chains
everywhere
a
man
in
his
utopia
may
have
for
all
i
know
free
food
free
meadows
his
own
estate
his
own
palace
what
does
it
matter
he
may
not
have
his
own
soul
an
architect
once
discoursed
to
me
on
the
need
of
humility
in
face
of
the
material
the
stone
and
marble
of
his
building
thus
chesterton
was
humble
before
the
reality
he
was
seeking
to
interpret
pride
he
once
defined
as
the
falsification
of
fact
by
the
introduction
of
self
to
learn
a
man
must
subtract
himself
from
the
study
of
any
solid
and
objective
thing
this
humility
he
had
in
a
high
degree
and
also
that
rarer
humility
which
saw
his
friends
and
his
opponents
alike
as
his
intellectual
equals
almost
anybody
monsignor
knox
once
said
was
an
ordinary
person
compared
with
him
but
this
was
an
idea
that
certainly
never
occurred
to
him
the
philosophy
shaping
into
was
stimulated
by
newspaper
controversy
and
also
by
the
talk
in
which
gilbert
always
delighted
as
i
have
noted
he
loved
to
listen
and
he
was
a
little
slow
in
getting
off
the
mark
with
his
own
contribution
many
years
later
an
american
interviewer
described
him
when
he
did
get
going
as
answering
questions
in
brief
essays
frank
swinnerton
has
admirably
described
the
manner
of
speech
so
well
remembered
by
his
friends
his
speech
is
prefaced
and
accompanied
by
a
curious
sort
of
humming
such
as
one
may
hear
when
glee
singers
give
each
other
the
note
before
starting
to
sing
he
pronounces
the
word
i
without
egotism
as
if
it
were
ayee
and
drawls
not
in
the
highly
gentlemanly
manner
which
americans
believe
to
be
the
english
accent
and
which
many
english
call
the
oxford
accent
but
in
a
manner
peculiar
to
himself
either
attractive
or
the
reverse
according
to
one
taste
to
me
attractive
p
even
more
attractive
to
most
of
us
was
his
fashion
of
making
us
feel
that
we
had
contributed
something
very
worthwhile
he
would
take
something
one
had
said
and
develop
it
till
it
shone
and
glowed
not
from
its
own
worth
but
from
what
he
had
made
of
it
almost
anything
could
thus
become
a
starting
point
for
a
train
of
his
best
thought
and
the
style
disliked
by
some
in
his
writings
was
so
completely
the
man
himself
that
it
was
the
same
in
conversation
as
in
his
books
he
would
approach
a
topic
from
every
side
throwing
light
on
those
contradictory
elements
that
made
a
paradox
he
himself
had
what
he
attributes
to
thomas
that
instantaneous
presence
of
mind
which
alone
really
deserves
the
name
of
wit
asked
once
the
traditional
question
what
single
book
he
would
choose
if
cast
on
a
desert
island
he
replied
thomas
to
practical
in
talk
as
in
his
books
loved
to
play
upon
words
and
sometimes
of
course
this
was
merely
a
matter
of
words
and
the
puns
were
bad
ones
once
for
instance
after
translating
the
french
phrase
for
playing
truant
as
he
goes
to
the
bushy
school
or
the
school
among
the
bushes
he
adds
not
lightly
to
be
confounded
with
the
art
school
at
bushey
this
is
indefensible
but
rare
christopher
morley
has
noted
how
his
play
upon
words
often
led
to
a
genuine
play
upon
thoughts
one
of
chesterton
best
pleasantries
was
his
remark
on
the
emancipation
of
women
million
young
women
rose
to
their
feet
with
the
cry
will
not
be
dictated
to
and
proceeded
to
become
stenographers
he
complained
in
a
review
of
a
novel
every
modern
man
is
an
atlas
carrying
the
world
and
we
are
introduced
to
a
new
cosmos
with
every
new
character
each
man
has
to
be
introduced
accompanied
by
his
cosmos
like
a
jealous
wife
or
on
the
principle
of
me
love
my
dogma
each
of
chesterton
readers
can
think
of
a
hundred
instances
of
this
inspired
fooling
many
have
been
given
in
this
book
and
many
will
yet
be
given
but
the
thing
went
far
deeper
than
fooling
it
has
been
compared
by
belloc
to
the
gospel
parables
as
a
method
of
teaching
and
of
illumination
he
made
men
see
what
they
had
not
seen
before
he
made
them
he
was
an
architect
of
certitude
whenever
he
practiced
the
art
in
which
he
excelled
belloc
analysis
of
this
special
element
in
chesterton
style
alike
written
and
spoken
is
of
first
rate
importance
to
an
understanding
of
the
man
whose
mind
at
this
date
was
still
rapidly
developing
while
his
method
of
expression
had
become
what
it
remained
to
the
end
of
his
life
his
unique
his
capital
genius
for
illustration
by
parallel
by
example
is
his
peculiar
mark
the
word
peculiar
is
here
the
operative
word
no
one
whatsoever
that
i
can
recall
in
the
whole
course
of
english
letters
had
his
amazing
i
would
almost
say
superhuman
capacity
for
parallelism
now
parallelism
is
a
gift
or
method
of
vast
effect
in
the
conveyance
of
truth
parallelism
consists
in
the
illustration
of
some
unperceived
truth
by
its
exact
consonance
with
the
reflection
of
a
truth
already
known
and
perceived
whenever
chesterton
begins
a
sentence
with
it
is
as
though
in
exploding
a
false
bit
of
reasoning
you
may
expect
a
stroke
of
parallelism
as
vivid
as
a
lightning
flash
always
in
whatever
manner
he
launched
the
parallelism
he
produced
the
shock
of
illumination
he
parallelism
was
so
native
to
his
mind
it
was
so
naturally
a
fruit
of
his
mental
character
that
he
had
difficulty
in
understanding
why
others
did
not
use
it
with
the
same
lavish
facility
as
himself
i
can
speak
here
with
experience
for
in
these
conversations
with
him
or
listening
to
his
conversation
with
others
i
was
always
astonished
at
an
ability
in
illustration
which
i
not
only
have
never
seen
equalled
but
can
not
remember
to
have
seen
attempted
he
never
sought
such
things
they
poured
out
from
him
as
easily
as
though
they
were
not
the
hard
forged
products
of
intense
vision
but
spontaneous
remarks
the
place
of
gilbert
chesterton
in
english
pp
to
return
to
the
blatchford
controversy
a
final
point
of
interest
is
a
psychological
one
admits
his
difficulty
in
using
in
his
arguments
the
reverent
solemnity
of
the
agnostic
he
realizes
that
he
is
thought
flippant
because
he
is
amusing
on
a
subject
where
he
is
more
certain
than
of
the
existence
of
the
moon
christianity
is
itself
so
jolly
a
thing
that
it
fills
the
possessor
of
it
with
a
certain
silly
exuberance
which
sad
and
rationalists
might
reasonably
mistake
for
mere
buffoonery
but
if
this
is
his
own
psychology
he
faces
too
the
special
difficulty
of
theirs
the
main
and
towering
barrier
that
he
wished
but
hardly
hoped
to
surmount
he
was
the
first
person
i
think
to
see
that
free
thought
was
no
longer
a
young
movement
but
old
and
even
fossilized
it
had
formed
minds
which
were
now
too
set
to
be
altered
it
had
its
own
dogmas
and
its
own
most
rigid
orthodoxy
you
are
armed
to
the
teeth
he
told
the
readers
of
the
and
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
with
the
great
agnostic
orthodoxy
perhaps
the
most
placid
and
perfect
of
all
the
orthodoxies
of
men
i
approach
you
with
the
reverence
and
the
courage
due
to
a
bench
of
bishops
the
controversy
was
as
we
have
seen
in
and
when
chesterton
was
approaching
thirty
others
of
those
i
have
mentioned
came
later
but
i
do
think
any
or
even
all
of
them
fully
explain
the
depth
and
richness
of
chapter
xiii
orthodoxy
is
either
eternal
or
it
is
not
philosophy
a
cosmic
philosophy
is
not
constructed
to
fit
a
man
a
cosmic
philosophy
is
constructed
to
fit
a
cosmos
a
man
can
no
more
possess
a
private
religion
than
he
can
possess
a
private
sun
and
to
the
book
of
because
is
supremely
chesterton
own
history
of
his
mind
more
must
be
said
of
it
than
of
his
other
published
works
for
this
book
is
the
life
of
a
man
and
a
man
is
his
mind
the
notebook
shows
him
thinking
and
feeling
in
his
youth
exactly
on
the
lines
that
he
recalls
but
they
were
only
lines
in
fact
an
outline
the
richness
of
life
was
needed
the
richness
of
thought
to
turn
the
outline
into
the
masterpiece
no
man
not
even
chesterton
could
have
written
at
the
age
of
twenty
it
was
sufficiently
remarkable
that
he
should
have
written
it
at
but
only
a
man
who
had
been
thinking
along
those
lines
at
twenty
and
much
earlier
could
have
written
it
at
all
for
the
book
is
as
he
says
a
sort
of
slovenly
autobiography
it
is
not
so
much
an
argument
for
orthodoxy
as
the
story
of
how
one
man
discovered
orthodoxy
as
the
only
answer
to
the
riddle
of
the
universe
in
an
interview
given
shortly
after
its
publication
gilbert
told
of
a
temptation
that
had
once
been
his
and
which
he
had
overcome
almost
before
he
realized
he
had
been
tempted
that
temptation
was
to
become
a
prophet
like
all
the
men
in
by
emphasizing
one
aspect
of
truth
and
ignoring
the
others
to
do
this
would
he
knew
bring
him
a
great
crowd
of
disciples
he
had
a
vision
which
constantly
grew
wider
and
deeper
of
the
unity
of
truth
but
he
saw
that
all
the
prophets
of
the
age
from
walt
whitman
and
schopenhauer
to
wells
and
shaw
had
become
so
by
taking
one
side
of
truth
and
making
it
all
of
truth
it
is
so
much
easier
to
see
and
magnify
a
part
than
laboriously
to
strive
to
embrace
the
whole
a
sage
feels
too
small
for
life
and
a
fool
too
large
for
it
not
that
he
condemned
as
fools
the
able
men
of
his
generation
for
wells
he
had
a
great
esteem
for
shaw
a
greater
whitman
he
had
in
his
youth
almost
idolized
but
increasingly
he
recognized
even
whitman
as
representing
an
idea
that
was
too
narrow
because
it
was
only
an
aspect
there
was
not
room
in
whitman
philosophy
for
some
of
the
facts
he
had
already
discovered
and
he
felt
he
had
not
yet
completed
his
journey
he
must
not
for
the
sake
of
being
a
prophet
and
of
having
a
following
sacrifice
i
will
not
say
a
truth
already
found
but
a
truth
that
might
still
be
lurking
somewhere
he
could
not
be
the
architect
of
his
own
intellectual
universe
any
more
than
he
had
been
the
creator
of
sun
moon
and
earth
god
and
humanity
made
it
he
said
of
the
philosophy
he
discovered
and
it
made
me
he
had
begun
in
boyhood
as
we
have
seen
by
realizing
that
the
world
as
depicted
in
fairy
tales
was
saner
and
more
sensible
than
the
world
as
seen
by
the
intellectuals
of
his
own
day
these
men
had
lost
the
sense
of
life
value
they
spoke
of
the
world
as
a
vast
place
governed
by
iron
laws
of
necessity
chesterton
felt
in
it
the
presence
of
will
while
the
mere
thought
of
vastness
was
to
him
about
as
cheerful
a
conception
as
that
of
a
jail
that
should
with
its
cold
empty
passages
cover
half
the
county
these
expanders
of
the
universe
had
nothing
to
show
us
except
more
and
more
infinite
corridors
of
space
lit
by
ghastly
suns
and
empty
of
all
that
was
divine
these
people
professed
that
the
universe
was
one
coherent
thing
but
they
were
not
fond
of
the
universe
but
i
was
frightfully
fond
of
the
universe
and
wanted
to
address
it
by
a
diminutive
i
often
did
so
and
it
never
seemed
to
mind
actually
and
in
truth
i
did
feel
that
these
dim
dogmas
of
vitality
were
better
expressed
by
calling
the
world
small
than
by
calling
it
large
for
about
infinity
there
was
a
sort
of
carelessness
which
was
the
reverse
of
the
fierce
and
pious
care
which
i
felt
touching
the
pricelessness
and
the
peril
of
life
they
showed
only
a
dreary
waste
but
i
felt
a
sort
of
sacred
thrift
for
economy
is
far
more
romantic
than
extravagance
to
them
stars
were
an
unending
income
of
halfpence
but
i
felt
about
the
golden
sun
and
the
silver
moon
as
a
schoolboy
feels
if
he
has
one
sovereign
and
one
shilling
these
subconscious
convictions
are
best
hit
off
by
the
colour
and
tone
of
certain
tales
thus
i
have
said
that
stories
of
magic
alone
can
express
my
sense
that
life
is
not
only
a
pleasure
but
a
kind
of
eccentric
privilege
i
may
express
this
other
feeling
of
cosmic
cosiness
by
allusion
to
another
book
always
read
in
boyhood
robinson
crusoe
which
i
read
about
this
time
and
which
owes
its
eternal
vivacity
to
the
fact
that
it
celebrates
the
poetry
of
limits
nay
even
the
wild
romance
of
prudence
crusoe
is
a
man
on
a
small
rock
with
a
few
comforts
just
snatched
from
the
sea
the
best
thing
in
the
book
is
simply
the
list
of
things
saved
from
the
wreck
the
greatest
of
poems
is
an
inventory
i
really
felt
the
fancy
may
seem
foolish
as
if
all
the
order
and
number
of
things
were
the
romantic
remnant
of
crusoe
ship
that
there
are
two
sexes
and
one
sun
was
like
the
fact
that
there
were
two
guns
and
one
axe
it
was
poignantly
urgent
that
none
should
be
lost
but
somehow
it
was
rather
fun
that
none
could
be
added
the
trees
and
the
planets
seemed
like
things
saved
from
the
wreck
and
when
i
saw
the
matterhorn
i
was
glad
that
it
had
not
been
overlooked
in
the
confusion
i
felt
economical
about
the
stars
as
if
they
were
sapphires
they
are
called
so
in
milton
eden
i
hoarded
the
hills
for
the
universe
is
a
single
jewel
and
while
it
is
a
natural
cant
to
talk
of
a
jewel
as
peerless
and
priceless
of
this
jewel
it
is
literally
true
this
cosmos
is
indeed
without
peer
and
without
price
for
there
can
not
be
another
one
chapter
iv
pp
a
fragment
of
an
essay
on
hans
anderson
that
can
not
be
later
than
the
age
of
seventeen
shows
gilbert
trying
to
shape
part
of
what
he
calls
here
the
ethics
of
elfland
but
a
large
part
was
as
he
says
subconscious
in
this
chapter
he
sums
up
the
results
of
musings
about
the
universe
begun
so
long
ago
small
wonder
that
he
had
seemed
to
sleep
over
his
lessons
while
he
was
seeing
these
visions
and
dreaming
these
dreams
which
after
every
effort
to
tell
them
he
still
knows
remains
half
untold
the
attempt
to
utter
the
unutterable
things
these
are
my
ultimate
attitudes
towards
life
the
soils
for
the
seeds
of
doctrine
these
in
some
dark
way
i
thought
before
i
could
write
and
felt
before
i
could
think
that
we
may
proceed
more
easily
afterwards
i
will
roughly
recapitulate
them
now
i
felt
in
my
bones
first
that
this
world
does
not
explain
itself
it
may
be
a
miracle
with
a
supernatural
explanation
it
may
be
a
conjuring
trick
with
a
natural
explanation
but
the
explanation
of
the
conjuring
trick
if
it
is
to
satisfy
me
will
have
to
be
better
than
the
natural
explanations
i
have
heard
the
thing
is
magic
true
or
false
second
i
came
to
feel
as
if
magic
must
have
a
meaning
and
meaning
must
have
some
one
to
mean
it
there
was
something
personal
in
the
world
as
in
a
work
of
art
whatever
it
meant
it
meant
violently
third
i
thought
this
purpose
beautiful
in
its
old
design
in
spite
of
its
defects
such
as
dragons
fourth
that
the
proper
form
of
thanks
to
it
is
some
form
of
humility
and
restraint
we
should
thank
god
for
beer
and
burgundy
by
not
drinking
too
much
of
them
we
owed
also
an
obedience
to
whatever
made
us
and
last
and
strangest
there
had
come
into
my
mind
a
vague
and
vast
impression
that
in
some
way
all
good
was
a
remnant
to
be
stored
and
held
sacred
out
of
some
primordial
ruin
man
had
saved
his
good
as
crusoe
saved
his
goods
he
had
saved
them
from
a
wreck
all
this
i
felt
and
the
age
gave
me
no
encouragement
to
feel
it
and
all
the
time
i
had
not
even
thought
of
christian
theology
pp
this
theology
came
with
the
answers
to
all
the
tremendous
questions
asked
by
life
here
the
convert
has
one
great
advantage
over
the
catholic
brought
up
in
the
faith
most
of
us
hear
the
answers
before
we
have
asked
the
questions
hence
intellectually
we
lack
what
calls
the
soils
for
the
seeds
of
doctrine
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
understand
an
answer
to
a
question
you
have
not
formulated
and
without
the
sense
of
urgency
that
an
insistent
question
brings
many
people
do
not
even
try
all
the
years
of
his
boyhood
and
early
manhood
chesterton
was
facing
the
fundamental
questions
and
hammering
out
his
answers
at
first
he
had
no
thought
of
christianity
as
even
a
possible
answer
growing
up
in
a
world
called
christian
he
fancied
it
a
philosophy
that
had
been
tried
and
found
wanting
it
was
only
as
he
realized
that
the
answers
he
was
finding
for
himself
always
fitted
into
were
always
confirmed
by
the
christian
view
of
things
that
he
began
to
turn
towards
it
he
sees
a
good
deal
of
humour
in
the
way
he
strained
his
voice
in
a
painfully
juvenile
attempt
to
utter
his
new
truths
only
to
find
that
they
were
not
his
and
were
not
new
but
were
part
of
an
eternal
philosophy
in
the
chapter
called
the
flag
of
the
world
he
tells
of
the
moment
when
he
discovered
the
confirmation
and
reinforcing
of
his
own
speculations
by
the
christian
theology
the
point
at
which
this
came
concerned
his
feelings
about
the
men
of
his
youth
who
labelled
themselves
optimist
and
pessimist
both
he
felt
were
wrong
it
must
be
possible
at
once
to
love
and
to
hate
the
world
to
love
it
more
than
enough
to
get
on
with
it
to
hate
it
enough
to
get
it
on
and
the
church
solved
this
difficulty
by
her
doctrine
of
creation
and
of
original
sin
god
had
written
not
so
much
a
poem
but
rather
a
play
a
play
he
had
planned
as
perfect
but
which
had
necessarily
been
left
to
human
actors
and
who
had
since
made
a
great
mess
of
it
as
to
that
mess
the
christian
could
be
as
pessimist
as
he
liked
as
to
the
original
design
he
must
be
optimist
for
it
was
his
work
to
restore
it
george
could
still
fight
the
dragon
if
he
were
as
big
as
the
world
he
could
yet
be
killed
in
the
name
of
the
world
and
then
followed
an
experience
impossible
to
describe
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
blundering
about
since
my
birth
with
two
huge
and
unmanageable
machines
of
different
shapes
and
without
apparent
connection
the
world
and
the
christian
tradition
i
had
found
this
hole
in
the
world
the
fact
that
one
must
somehow
find
a
way
of
loving
the
world
without
trusting
it
somehow
one
must
love
the
world
without
being
worldly
i
found
this
projecting
feature
of
christian
theology
like
a
sort
of
hard
spike
the
dogmatic
insistence
that
god
was
personal
and
had
made
a
world
separate
from
himself
the
spike
of
dogma
fitted
exactly
into
the
hole
in
the
world
it
had
evidently
been
meant
to
go
there
and
then
the
strange
thing
began
to
happen
when
once
these
two
parts
of
the
two
machines
had
come
together
one
after
another
all
the
other
parts
fitted
and
fell
in
with
an
eerie
exactitude
i
could
hear
bolt
after
bolt
over
all
the
machinery
falling
into
its
place
with
a
kind
of
click
of
relief
having
got
one
part
right
all
the
other
parts
were
repeating
that
rectitude
as
clock
after
clock
strikes
noon
instinct
after
instinct
was
answered
by
doctrine
after
doctrine
or
to
vary
the
metaphor
i
was
like
one
who
had
advanced
into
a
hostile
country
to
take
one
high
fortress
and
when
that
fort
had
fallen
the
whole
country
surrendered
and
turned
solid
behind
me
the
whole
land
was
lit
up
as
it
were
back
to
the
first
fields
of
my
childhood
all
those
blind
fancies
of
boyhood
which
in
the
fourth
chapter
i
have
tried
in
vain
to
trace
on
the
darkness
became
suddenly
transparent
and
sane
i
was
right
when
i
felt
that
i
would
almost
rather
say
that
grass
was
the
wrong
colour
than
say
that
it
must
by
necessity
have
been
that
colour
it
might
verily
have
been
any
other
my
sense
that
happiness
hung
on
the
crazy
thread
of
a
condition
did
mean
something
when
all
was
said
it
meant
the
whole
doctrine
of
the
fall
even
those
dim
and
shapeless
monsters
of
notions
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
describe
much
less
defend
stepped
quietly
into
their
places
like
colossal
caryatides
of
the
creed
the
fancy
that
the
cosmos
was
not
vast
and
void
but
small
and
cosy
had
a
fulfilled
significance
now
for
anything
that
is
a
work
of
art
must
be
small
in
the
sight
of
the
artist
to
god
the
stars
might
be
only
small
and
dear
like
diamonds
and
my
haunting
instinct
that
somehow
good
was
not
merely
a
tool
to
be
used
but
a
relic
to
be
guarded
like
the
goods
from
crusoe
ship
even
that
had
been
the
wild
whisper
of
something
originally
wise
for
according
to
christianity
we
were
indeed
the
survivors
of
a
wreck
the
crew
of
a
golden
ship
that
had
gone
down
before
the
beginning
of
the
world
chapter
v
pp
in
a
chapter
called
the
paradoxes
of
christianity
the
richness
of
his
mind
is
most
manifest
and
in
that
chapter
can
best
be
seen
what
belloc
meant
when
he
told
me
chesterton
style
reminded
him
of
augustine
talking
over
with
an
old
schoolfellow
of
his
the
list
of
books
he
had
as
we
have
seen
drawn
up
for
i
discovered
deep
doubt
as
to
whether
gilbert
would
really
have
read
these
books
as
most
of
us
understand
reading
combined
with
a
conviction
that
he
would
have
got
out
of
them
at
a
glance
more
than
most
of
us
by
prolonged
study
i
have
certainly
never
known
anyone
his
equal
at
what
the
schoolboy
calls
degutting
a
book
he
did
not
seem
to
study
an
author
yet
he
certainly
knew
him
but
it
remained
that
his
own
mind
reflecting
and
experiencing
made
of
his
own
life
his
greatest
storehouse
so
that
in
all
this
book
there
was
as
my
father
pointed
out
in
the
at
the
time
an
intensely
original
new
light
cast
on
the
eternal
philosophy
about
which
so
much
had
already
been
written
the
discovery
specially
needed
perhaps
for
his
own
age
was
that
christianity
represented
a
new
balance
that
constituted
a
liberation
the
ancient
greek
or
roman
had
aimed
at
equilibrium
by
enforcing
moderation
and
getting
rid
of
extremes
christianity
made
moderation
out
of
the
still
crash
of
two
impetuous
emotions
it
got
over
the
difficulty
of
combining
furious
opposites
by
keeping
them
both
and
keeping
them
both
furious
the
more
i
considered
christianity
the
more
i
felt
that
while
it
had
established
a
rule
and
order
the
chief
aim
of
that
order
was
to
give
room
for
good
things
to
run
wild
thus
inside
christianity
the
pacifist
could
become
a
monk
and
the
warrior
a
crusader
francis
could
praise
good
more
loudly
than
walt
whitman
and
jerome
denounce
evil
more
darkly
than
schopenhauer
but
both
emotions
must
be
kept
in
their
place
i
remember
how
george
wyndham
laughed
as
he
recited
to
us
the
paragraph
where
this
idea
reached
its
climax
and
sometimes
this
pure
gentleness
and
this
pure
fierceness
met
and
justified
their
juncture
the
paradox
of
all
the
prophets
was
fulfilled
and
in
the
soul
of
louis
the
lion
lay
down
with
the
lamb
but
remember
that
this
text
is
too
lightly
interpreted
it
is
constantly
assumed
especially
in
our
tolstoyan
tendencies
that
when
the
lion
lies
down
with
the
lamb
the
lion
becomes
but
that
is
brutal
annexation
and
imperialism
on
the
part
of
the
lamb
that
is
simply
the
lamb
absorbing
the
lion
instead
of
the
lion
eating
the
lamb
the
real
problem
is
can
the
lion
lie
down
with
the
lamb
and
still
retain
his
royal
ferocity
is
the
problem
the
church
attempted
is
the
miracle
she
achieved
chapter
vi
pp
all
this
applied
not
only
to
the
release
of
the
emotions
the
development
of
all
the
elements
that
go
to
make
up
humanity
but
even
more
to
the
truths
of
revelation
a
heresy
always
means
lopping
off
a
part
of
the
truth
and
therefore
ultimately
a
loss
of
liberty
orthodoxy
in
keeping
the
whole
truth
safeguarded
freedom
and
prevented
any
one
of
the
great
and
devouring
ideas
she
was
teaching
from
swallowing
any
other
truth
this
was
the
justification
of
councils
of
definitions
even
of
persecutions
and
wars
of
religion
that
they
had
stood
for
the
defence
of
reason
as
well
as
of
faith
they
had
stood
to
prevent
the
suicide
of
thought
which
must
result
if
the
exciting
but
difficult
balance
were
lost
that
had
replaced
the
classical
moderation
the
church
could
not
afford
to
swerve
a
hair
breadth
on
some
things
if
she
was
to
continue
her
great
and
daring
experiment
of
the
irregular
equilibrium
once
let
one
idea
become
less
powerful
and
some
other
idea
would
become
too
powerful
it
was
no
flock
of
sheep
the
christian
shepherd
was
leading
but
a
herd
of
bulls
and
tigers
of
terrible
ideals
and
devouring
doctrines
each
one
of
them
strong
enough
to
turn
to
a
false
religion
and
lay
waste
the
world
remember
that
the
church
went
in
specifically
for
dangerous
ideas
she
was
a
lion
tamer
the
idea
of
birth
through
a
holy
spirit
of
the
death
of
a
divine
being
of
the
forgiveness
of
sins
or
the
fulfilment
of
prophecies
are
ideas
which
any
one
can
see
need
but
a
touch
to
turn
them
into
something
blasphemous
or
ferocious
a
sentence
phrased
wrong
about
the
nature
of
symbolism
would
have
broken
all
the
best
statues
in
europe
a
slip
in
the
definitions
might
stop
all
the
dances
might
wither
all
the
christmas
trees
or
break
all
the
easter
eggs
doctrines
had
to
be
defined
within
strict
limits
even
in
order
that
man
might
enjoy
general
human
liberties
the
church
had
to
be
careful
if
only
that
the
world
might
be
careless
this
is
the
thrilling
romance
of
orthodoxy
people
have
fallen
into
a
foolish
habit
of
speaking
of
orthodoxy
as
something
heavy
humdrum
and
safe
there
never
was
anything
so
perilous
or
so
exciting
as
orthodoxy
it
was
sanity
and
to
be
sane
is
more
dramatic
than
to
be
mad
it
was
the
equilibrium
of
a
man
behind
madly
rushing
horses
seeming
to
stoop
this
way
and
to
sway
that
yet
in
every
attitude
having
the
grace
of
statuary
and
the
accuracy
of
arithmetic
the
church
in
its
early
days
went
fierce
and
fast
with
any
warhorse
yet
it
is
utterly
unhistoric
to
say
that
she
merely
went
mad
along
one
idea
like
a
vulgar
fanaticism
she
swerved
to
left
and
right
so
as
exactly
to
avoid
enormous
obstacles
she
left
on
one
hand
the
huge
bulk
of
arianism
buttressed
by
all
the
worldly
powers
to
make
christianity
too
worldly
the
next
instant
she
was
swerving
to
avoid
an
orientalism
which
would
have
made
it
too
unworldly
the
orthodox
church
never
took
the
tame
course
or
accepted
the
conventions
the
orthodox
church
was
never
respectable
it
would
have
been
easier
to
have
accepted
the
earthly
power
of
the
arians
it
would
have
been
easy
in
the
calvinistic
seventeenth
century
to
fall
into
the
bottomless
pit
of
predestination
it
is
easy
to
be
a
madman
it
is
easy
to
be
a
heretic
it
is
always
easy
to
let
the
age
have
its
head
the
difficult
thing
is
to
keep
one
own
it
is
always
easy
to
be
a
modernist
as
it
is
easy
to
be
a
snob
to
have
fallen
into
any
of
those
open
traps
of
error
and
exaggeration
which
fashion
after
fashion
and
sect
after
sect
set
along
the
historic
path
of
christendom
that
would
indeed
have
been
simple
it
is
always
simple
to
fall
there
are
an
infinity
of
angles
at
which
one
falls
only
one
at
which
one
stands
to
have
fallen
into
any
one
of
the
fads
from
gnosticism
to
christian
science
would
indeed
have
been
obvious
and
tame
but
to
have
avoided
them
all
has
been
one
whirling
adventure
and
in
my
vision
the
heavenly
chariot
flies
thundering
through
the
ages
the
dull
heresies
sprawling
and
prostrate
the
wild
truth
reeling
but
erect
chapter
vi
pp
no
quotation
can
adequately
convey
the
wealth
of
thought
in
the
book
yet
amazingly
the
reviewer
rebuked
for
substituting
emotion
for
intellect
partly
on
the
strength
of
a
sentence
in
the
chapter
called
the
maniac
the
madman
is
the
man
who
has
lost
everything
except
his
reason
the
reviews
when
one
reads
them
as
a
whole
exactly
confirm
what
wilfrid
ward
said
in
the
review
that
whereas
he
had
regarded
as
a
triumphant
vindication
of
his
own
view
that
was
a
really
profound
thinker
he
found
to
his
amazement
that
those
who
had
thought
him
superficial
hailed
it
as
a
proof
of
theirs
obviously
with
a
man
so
much
concerned
with
ultimates
the
place
accorded
him
in
letters
will
depend
upon
whether
one
agrees
or
disagrees
with
his
conclusions
in
a
country
that
is
not
catholic
this
consideration
must
affect
the
standing
of
any
catholic
thinker
thus
newman
was
considered
by
carlyle
to
have
the
brain
of
a
moderate
sized
rabbit
yet
by
others
his
is
counted
the
greatest
mind
of
the
century
similarly
arnold
bennett
could
credit
chesterton
with
only
a
intellectual
apparatus
because
he
was
a
dogmatist
to
this
chesterton
replied
in
versus
in
truth
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
people
those
who
accept
dogmas
and
know
it
and
those
who
accept
dogmas
and
do
know
it
my
only
advantage
over
the
gifted
novelist
lies
in
my
belonging
to
the
former
class
if
one
grasps
the
catholic
view
of
dogma
the
answer
is
satisfying
if
not
the
objector
is
left
with
his
original
objection
as
against
chesterton
as
against
newman
and
chesterton
had
the
extra
disadvantage
of
being
a
journalist
famous
for
his
jokes
now
moving
in
newman
unquestioned
field
of
philosophy
and
theology
it
was
in
part
the
difficulty
of
convincing
a
man
against
his
will
these
critics
as
wilfrid
ward
pointed
out
read
superficially
and
looked
only
at
the
fooling
the
fantastic
puns
and
comparisons
ignoring
the
underlying
deep
seriousness
and
lines
of
thought
that
made
him
as
it
then
seemed
boldly
rank
chesterton
with
such
writers
as
butler
coleridge
and
newman
taking
as
his
text
the
saying
truth
can
understand
error
but
error
can
not
understand
truth
wilfrid
ward
called
his
article
chesterton
among
the
prophets
he
showed
especially
the
curious
confusion
made
in
such
comments
as
the
one
i
have
quoted
from
the
and
made
clearer
what
chesterton
was
really
saying
by
a
comparison
with
the
illative
sense
of
cardinal
newman
it
is
the
usual
difficulty
of
trying
to
express
a
partly
new
idea
newman
had
coined
an
expression
but
it
did
not
express
all
he
meant
still
less
all
that
chesterton
meant
yet
it
was
difficult
to
use
the
word
reason
in
this
particular
discussion
without
giving
to
it
two
different
meanings
for
in
two
chapters
the
maniac
and
the
suicide
of
thought
chesterton
was
concerned
to
show
that
authority
was
needed
for
the
defence
of
reason
in
the
larger
sense
against
its
own
power
of
yet
the
maniac
commits
this
suicide
by
an
excessive
use
of
reason
in
the
narrower
sense
he
is
not
hampered
by
a
sense
of
humour
or
by
charity
or
by
the
dumb
certainties
of
experience
he
is
the
more
logical
for
losing
certain
sane
affections
he
is
in
the
clean
and
prison
of
one
idea
he
is
sharpened
to
one
painful
point
to
chesterton
it
seemed
that
most
of
the
modern
religions
and
philosophies
were
like
the
argument
by
which
a
madman
suffering
from
persecution
mania
proves
that
he
is
in
a
world
of
enemies
it
is
complete
it
is
unanswerable
yet
it
is
false
the
madman
mind
moves
in
a
perfect
but
narrow
circle
the
insane
explanation
is
quite
as
complete
as
the
sane
one
only
it
is
not
so
large
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
narrow
universality
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
small
and
cramped
eternity
you
may
see
it
in
many
modern
religions
philosophies
such
as
materialism
idealism
monism
all
have
in
their
explanations
of
the
universe
this
quality
of
the
madman
argument
of
covering
everything
and
leaving
everything
out
the
materialist
like
the
madman
is
unconscious
of
the
alien
energies
and
the
large
indifference
of
the
earth
he
is
not
thinking
of
the
real
things
of
the
earth
of
fighting
peoples
or
proud
mothers
or
first
love
or
fear
upon
the
sea
the
earth
is
so
very
large
and
the
cosmos
is
so
very
small
people
sometimes
say
life
is
larger
than
logic
when
they
want
to
dismiss
logic
but
that
was
not
chesterton
way
he
wanted
logic
he
needed
logic
as
part
of
the
abundance
of
the
mind
life
as
part
of
a
much
larger
whole
what
was
the
word
we
are
looking
for
it
still
for
a
use
of
the
mind
that
included
all
these
things
logic
and
imagination
mysticism
and
ecstasy
and
poetry
and
joy
a
use
of
the
mind
that
could
embrace
the
universe
and
reach
upwards
to
god
without
losing
its
balance
the
mind
must
work
in
time
yet
it
can
reach
out
into
eternity
it
is
conditioned
by
space
but
it
can
glimpse
infinity
the
modern
world
had
imprisoned
the
mind
far
more
than
the
body
it
needed
great
open
spaces
and
chesterton
breaking
violently
out
of
prison
looked
around
and
saw
how
the
church
had
given
health
to
the
mind
by
giving
it
space
to
move
in
and
great
ideas
to
move
among
chesterton
the
poet
saw
too
that
man
is
a
poet
and
must
therefore
get
his
head
into
the
heavens
he
needs
mysticism
and
among
her
great
ideas
the
church
gives
him
mysteries
chapter
xiv
bernard
shaw
chapter
was
read
by
his
remarks
are
printed
in
footnotes
a
facsimile
of
the
one
page
altered
substantially
by
him
is
omitted
in
this
electronic
edition
when
anyone
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
made
a
list
of
the
english
writers
most
in
the
public
eye
such
a
list
always
included
the
names
of
bernard
shaw
and
chesterton
but
a
good
many
people
in
writing
down
these
names
did
so
with
unconcealed
irritation
and
i
think
it
is
important
at
this
stage
to
see
why
these
men
were
constantly
arguing
with
each
other
but
the
literary
public
felt
all
the
same
that
they
represented
something
in
common
and
the
literary
public
was
by
no
means
sure
that
it
liked
that
something
it
could
not
quite
resist
bernard
shaw
plays
it
loved
chesterton
whenever
it
could
rebuke
him
affectionately
for
paradox
and
levity
what
that
public
succumbed
to
in
these
men
was
their
art
it
was
by
no
means
so
certain
that
it
liked
their
meaning
and
so
the
literary
public
elected
to
say
that
shaw
and
chesterton
were
having
a
cheap
success
by
standing
on
their
heads
and
declaring
that
black
was
white
the
audience
watched
a
shaw
chesterton
debate
as
a
sham
fight
or
a
display
of
fireworks
as
indeed
it
always
partly
was
for
each
of
them
would
have
died
rather
than
really
hurt
the
other
but
shaw
and
chesterton
were
operating
on
their
minds
all
the
time
they
were
allowed
to
sit
in
the
stalls
and
applaud
but
they
were
themselves
being
challenged
and
that
spoilt
their
comfort
chesterton
in
his
complains
of
the
falsity
of
most
of
the
pictures
of
england
during
the
victorian
era
the
languishing
fainting
females
who
were
in
fact
far
than
their
today
the
tyrannical
pious
fathers
the
dull
conventional
lives
it
all
rings
false
to
anyone
who
grew
up
in
an
average
victorian
home
and
was
happy
enough
there
there
was
however
one
thing
fundamentally
wrong
in
such
homes
and
it
was
on
this
fundamental
sin
that
he
agreed
with
shaw
in
waging
a
relentless
war
the
middle
classes
of
england
were
thoroughly
and
smugly
satisfied
with
social
conditions
that
were
intolerable
for
the
great
mass
of
their
fellow
countrymen
they
had
erected
between
the
classes
artificial
barriers
and
now
did
not
even
look
over
the
top
of
them
i
remember
how
when
my
mother
started
a
settlement
in
south
london
the
head
worker
told
us
she
often
saw
women
groping
in
the
dirt
under
the
fish
barrows
for
the
heads
and
tails
of
fishes
to
boil
for
their
children
the
settlement
began
to
give
the
children
dinners
of
dumplings
or
rice
pudding
and
treacle
and
many
friends
would
give
my
mother
a
pound
or
so
to
help
this
work
but
the
suggestion
that
government
should
intervene
was
socialism
the
idea
that
here
was
a
symptom
of
a
widespread
evil
was
scouted
utterly
people
might
have
learnt
much
from
their
own
servants
of
how
the
rest
of
humanity
were
living
but
while
said
chesterton
they
laughed
at
the
idea
of
the
mediaeval
baron
whose
vassals
ate
below
the
salt
their
own
vassals
ate
and
lived
below
the
floor
at
no
time
in
the
christian
past
had
there
been
such
a
deep
and
wide
cleavage
in
humanity
the
first
thing
that
and
wells
too
and
belloc
were
all
agreed
upon
was
that
the
upper
and
middle
classes
of
england
must
be
reminded
if
need
were
by
a
series
of
earthquakes
that
they
were
living
in
an
unreal
world
they
had
forgotten
the
human
race
to
which
they
belonged
they
a
tiny
section
spoke
of
the
mass
of
mankind
as
the
poor
or
the
lower
orders
almost
as
they
might
speak
of
the
beasts
of
the
forest
as
beings
of
a
different
race
chesterton
had
a
profound
and
noble
respect
for
the
poor
shaw
declared
that
they
were
useless
dangerous
and
ought
to
be
abolished
but
for
both
men
the
handful
of
quarrelsome
cliques
called
the
literary
world
was
far
too
small
because
it
was
so
tiny
a
section
of
the
human
race
shaw
and
chesterton
had
in
fact
discovered
the
social
problem
today
whether
people
intend
to
do
anything
about
it
or
not
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
knowing
something
about
it
but
at
that
date
the
idea
was
general
that
all
was
as
well
as
could
be
expected
in
an
imperfect
world
the
trades
unionists
were
telling
a
different
story
but
they
could
not
hope
to
reach
intellectually
the
classes
they
were
attacking
here
were
men
who
could
not
be
ignored
and
i
can
not
but
think
that
it
was
sometimes
the
mere
utterance
of
unwelcome
truth
in
brilliant
speech
that
aroused
the
cry
of
paradox
i
hear
many
people
wrote
chesterton
complain
that
bernard
shaw
deliberately
mystifies
them
i
can
not
imagine
what
they
mean
it
seems
to
me
that
he
deliberately
insults
them
his
language
especially
on
moral
questions
is
generally
as
straight
and
solid
as
that
of
a
bargee
and
far
less
ornate
and
symbolic
than
that
of
a
the
prosperous
english
philistine
complains
that
shaw
is
making
a
fool
of
him
whereas
shaw
is
not
in
the
least
making
a
fool
of
him
shaw
is
with
laborious
lucidity
calling
him
a
fool
calls
a
landlord
a
thief
and
the
landlord
instead
of
denying
or
resenting
it
says
ah
that
fellow
hides
his
meaning
so
cleverly
that
one
can
never
make
out
what
he
means
it
is
all
so
and
fantastical
calls
a
statesman
a
liar
to
his
face
and
the
statesman
cries
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
ah
what
quaint
intricate
and
trains
of
thought
ah
what
elusive
and
mysteries
of
i
think
it
is
always
quite
plain
what
shaw
means
even
when
he
is
joking
and
it
generally
means
that
the
people
he
is
talking
to
ought
to
howl
aloud
for
their
sins
but
the
average
representative
of
them
undoubtedly
treats
the
shavian
meaning
as
tricky
and
complex
when
it
is
really
direct
and
offensive
he
always
accuses
shaw
of
pulling
his
leg
at
the
exact
moment
when
shaw
is
pulling
his
nose
bernard
pp
chesterton
was
however
in
agreement
with
the
ordinary
citizen
and
in
disagreement
with
shaw
as
to
much
of
shaw
essential
teaching
and
here
we
touch
a
matter
so
involved
that
even
today
it
is
hard
to
disentangle
it
completely
i
suppose
it
will
always
be
possible
for
two
observers
to
look
at
human
beings
acting
to
hear
them
talking
and
to
arrive
at
two
entirely
different
interpretations
of
what
they
mean
this
is
certainly
the
case
with
any
very
recent
period
and
perhaps
especially
with
our
own
recent
history
we
have
within
living
memory
ended
a
period
and
begun
an
exceedingly
different
period
and
we
tend
to
judge
the
former
by
the
light
or
the
darkness
of
the
latter
the
victorian
age
even
in
its
extreme
old
age
was
still
tacitly
assuming
and
legally
enforcing
as
axioms
the
christian
moral
system
especially
in
regard
to
marriage
and
all
sex
questions
and
the
sacred
nature
of
property
to
read
many
disquisitions
on
that
period
today
one
would
suppose
that
no
one
living
really
believed
in
these
things
that
humbug
explained
the
first
and
greed
the
second
this
is
surely
a
false
perspective
the
age
was
an
enormously
conventional
one
these
fundamental
ideas
had
become
fossilized
and
meaningless
for
an
increasing
number
of
younger
people
but
when
bernard
shaw
called
himself
an
atheist
out
of
a
kind
of
insane
generosity
towards
bradlaugh
see
his
letter
to
later
in
this
chapter
or
described
all
property
as
theft
it
was
a
real
moral
indignation
that
was
roused
in
many
minds
real
but
exceedingly
confused
it
testified
to
the
need
of
the
ordinary
man
to
live
by
a
creed
that
he
need
not
question
shaw
and
chesterton
were
philosophers
and
philosophers
love
asking
questions
as
well
as
answering
them
but
the
average
man
wants
to
live
by
his
creed
not
question
it
and
the
elder
victorians
had
still
some
kind
of
creed
there
were
many
who
believed
in
god
there
were
others
who
believed
that
the
christian
moral
system
must
remain
because
it
had
commended
itself
to
man
nature
as
the
highest
and
best
and
was
the
true
fruit
of
evolutionary
progress
there
were
certainly
some
who
were
angry
because
they
thought
chaos
must
follow
any
tampering
with
the
existing
social
order
but
if
you
take
the
mass
of
those
who
tried
to
laugh
bernard
shaw
aside
and
grew
angry
when
they
could
not
do
so
you
find
at
the
root
of
the
anger
an
intense
dislike
of
having
any
part
of
a
system
questioned
which
was
to
them
unquestionable
which
they
had
erected
into
a
creed
they
thought
shaw
ideas
dangerous
and
wanted
to
keep
them
from
the
young
they
did
not
want
anyone
to
ask
how
a
civilisation
had
laid
its
principles
open
to
this
brilliant
and
effective
siege
they
hated
shaw
questions
before
they
began
to
hate
his
answers
and
that
is
probably
why
so
many
linked
chesterton
with
shaw
he
gave
different
answers
but
he
was
asking
many
of
the
same
questions
he
questioned
everything
as
shaw
did
only
he
pushed
his
questions
further
they
were
deeper
and
more
searching
shaw
would
not
accept
the
old
scriptural
orthodoxy
refused
to
accept
the
new
agnostic
orthodoxy
neither
man
would
accept
the
orthodoxy
of
the
scientists
both
were
prepared
to
attack
what
butler
had
called
the
science
ridden
art
ridden
culture
ridden
ridden
cliffs
of
old
england
they
attacked
first
by
the
mere
process
of
asking
questions
and
the
world
thus
questioned
grew
uneasy
and
seemed
to
care
curiously
little
for
the
fact
that
the
two
questioners
were
answering
their
own
questions
in
an
opposite
fashion
where
shaw
said
give
up
pretending
you
believe
in
god
for
you
do
chesterton
said
rediscover
the
reasons
for
believing
or
else
our
race
is
lost
where
shaw
said
abolish
private
property
which
has
produced
this
ghastly
poverty
chesterton
said
abolish
ghastly
poverty
by
restoring
property
and
the
audience
said
these
two
men
in
strange
paradoxes
seem
to
us
to
be
saying
the
same
thing
if
indeed
they
are
saying
anything
at
all
chesterton
wrote
later
of
a
young
man
whose
aunt
had
disinherited
him
for
socialism
because
of
a
lecture
he
had
delivered
against
that
economic
theory
and
i
well
remember
how
often
after
my
own
energetic
attempts
to
explain
why
a
distributist
was
not
a
socialist
i
was
met
with
a
weary
well
it
just
the
same
it
was
just
the
same
question
it
was
an
entirely
different
answer
but
the
audience
annoyed
by
the
question
never
seemed
to
listen
to
the
answer
one
man
was
saying
sweep
away
the
old
beliefs
of
humanity
and
start
fresh
the
other
was
saying
rediscover
your
reasons
for
these
profound
beliefs
make
them
once
more
effective
for
they
are
of
the
very
nature
of
man
shaw
and
chesterton
were
themselves
deeply
concerned
about
the
answers
both
sincere
both
dealing
with
realities
they
were
prepared
to
accept
each
other
sincerity
and
to
fight
the
matter
out
if
need
were
endlessly
being
writers
they
conducted
their
discussions
in
writing
being
journalists
they
did
so
mainly
in
the
newspapers
to
the
delight
or
fury
of
other
journalists
a
jealous
few
were
enraged
at
what
they
called
publicity
hunting
but
most
realised
that
it
was
not
a
private
fight
anyone
might
join
in
and
a
good
many
did
belloc
was
in
the
fight
as
early
as
chesterton
and
of
course
on
the
same
side
who
had
invented
the
chesterbelloc
declared
that
chesterton
felt
obliged
to
embrace
the
dogmas
of
catholicism
lest
belloc
soul
should
be
damned
wells
agreed
in
the
main
with
shaw
both
were
fabians
and
both
were
ready
with
a
fabian
utopia
for
humanity
which
belloc
and
chesterton
felt
would
be
little
better
than
a
prison
cecil
chesterton
coming
in
at
an
angle
of
his
own
wrote
some
effective
articles
he
was
a
fabian
actually
an
official
fabian
but
his
outlook
already
embraced
many
of
the
chesterbelloc
human
and
genial
ideals
although
he
still
ridiculed
their
utopia
of
the
peasant
state
small
ownership
and
all
that
came
later
to
be
called
distributism
like
the
the
itself
a
socialist
paper
saw
the
wisdom
of
giving
a
platform
to
both
sides
and
in
this
paper
appeared
the
best
articles
that
the
controversy
produced
meanwhile
the
private
friendship
between
and
was
growing
apace
very
early
on
shaw
had
begun
to
urge
to
write
a
play
was
perhaps
beginning
to
feel
that
newspaper
controversy
did
not
give
him
space
to
say
all
he
wanted
about
shaw
or
perhaps
it
was
merely
that
lane
had
persuaded
him
to
promise
them
a
book
on
shaw
for
a
series
they
were
producing
anyhow
in
a
letter
of
shaw
again
urges
the
play
and
gives
interesting
information
for
the
book
ayot
lawrence
welwyn
herts
march
my
dear
what
about
that
play
it
is
no
use
trying
to
answer
me
in
the
new
age
the
real
answer
to
my
article
is
the
play
i
have
tried
fair
means
the
new
age
article
was
the
inauguration
of
an
assault
below
the
belt
i
shall
deliberately
destroy
your
credit
as
an
essayist
as
a
journalist
as
a
critic
as
a
liberal
as
everything
that
offers
your
laziness
a
refuge
until
starvation
and
shame
drive
you
to
serious
dramatic
parturition
i
shall
repeat
my
public
challenge
to
you
vaunt
my
superiority
insult
your
corpulence
torture
belloc
if
necessary
call
on
you
and
steal
your
wife
affections
by
intellectual
and
athletic
displays
until
you
contribute
something
to
the
british
drama
you
are
played
out
as
an
essayist
your
ardor
is
soddened
your
intellectual
substance
crumbled
by
the
attempt
to
keep
up
the
work
of
your
twenties
in
your
thirties
another
five
years
of
this
and
you
will
be
the
apologist
of
every
infamy
that
wears
a
liberal
or
catholic
mask
you
too
will
speak
of
the
portraits
of
vecelli
and
the
assumption
of
allegri
and
declare
that
democracy
refuses
to
these
honest
citizens
as
titian
and
correggio
even
that
colossal
fragment
of
your
ruined
honesty
that
still
stupendously
dismisses
beethoven
as
some
rubbish
about
a
piano
will
give
way
to
remarks
about
a
graceful
second
subject
in
the
relative
minor
nothing
can
save
you
now
except
a
rebirth
as
a
dramatist
i
have
done
my
turn
and
i
now
call
on
you
to
take
yours
and
do
a
man
work
it
is
my
solemn
belief
that
it
was
my
quintessence
of
ibsenism
that
rescued
you
and
all
your
ungrateful
generation
from
materialism
and
rationalism
you
were
all
tired
young
atheists
turning
to
kipling
and
ruskinian
anglicanism
whilst
i
with
the
angel
wings
beating
in
my
ears
from
beethoven
symphony
oh
blasphemous
walker
in
deafness
gave
you
in
and
two
novels
in
which
you
had
your
hero
immediately
followed
by
my
beethovenian
hero
true
nobody
read
them
but
was
that
my
fault
they
are
read
now
it
seems
mostly
in
pirated
reprints
in
spite
of
their
appalling
puerility
and
classical
perfection
of
style
you
are
right
as
to
my
being
a
born
pedant
like
all
great
artists
and
are
at
least
useful
as
documentary
evidence
that
i
was
no
more
a
materialist
when
i
wrote
among
the
at
than
when
i
wrote
at
cecil
avowed
this
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
my
appearances
on
the
platform
of
the
hall
of
science
were
three
in
number
once
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
discussion
in
opposition
to
bradlaugh
who
was
defending
property
against
socialism
bradlaugh
died
after
that
though
i
do
not
claim
to
have
killed
him
the
socialist
league
challenged
him
to
debate
with
me
at
hall
but
we
could
not
or
would
not
agree
as
to
the
proposition
to
be
debated
he
insisting
on
my
being
bound
by
all
the
publications
of
the
democratic
federation
to
which
i
did
not
belong
and
i
refusing
to
be
bound
by
anything
on
earth
or
in
heaven
except
the
proposition
that
socialism
would
benefit
the
english
people
and
so
the
debate
never
came
off
now
in
those
days
they
were
throwing
bradlaugh
out
of
the
house
of
commons
with
bodily
violence
and
all
one
could
do
was
to
call
oneself
an
atheist
all
over
the
place
which
i
accordingly
did
at
the
first
public
meeting
of
the
shelley
society
at
university
college
addressed
by
stopford
brooke
i
made
my
then
famous
among
people
declaration
i
am
a
socialist
an
atheist
and
a
vegetarian
ergo
a
true
shelleyan
whereupon
two
ladies
who
had
been
palpitating
with
enthusiasm
for
shelley
under
the
impression
that
he
was
a
devout
anglican
resigned
on
the
spot
my
second
hall
of
science
appearance
was
after
the
last
of
the
debates
at
james
hall
where
the
two
champions
never
touched
the
ostensible
subject
of
their
difference
the
eight
hours
day
at
all
but
simply
talked
socialism
or
with
a
hearty
dislike
and
contempt
for
one
another
foote
was
then
in
his
prime
as
the
successor
of
bradlaugh
and
as
neither
the
secularists
nor
the
socialists
were
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
debate
it
was
renewed
for
two
nights
at
the
hall
of
science
between
me
and
foote
a
verbatim
report
was
published
for
sixpence
and
is
now
a
treasure
of
collectors
having
the
last
word
on
the
second
night
i
had
to
make
a
handsome
and
the
secularists
were
much
pleased
by
my
declaring
that
i
was
altogether
on
foote
side
in
his
struggle
with
the
established
religion
of
the
country
when
bradlaugh
died
the
secularists
wanted
a
new
leader
because
b
enormous
and
magnetic
personality
left
a
void
that
nobody
was
big
enough
to
fill
it
was
really
like
the
death
of
napoleon
in
that
world
there
was
robertson
foote
and
charles
watts
but
bradlaugh
liked
foote
as
little
as
most
autocrats
like
their
successors
and
when
he
before
his
death
surrendered
the
gavel
the
hammer
for
thumping
the
table
to
secure
order
at
a
meeting
which
was
the
presidential
sceptre
of
the
national
secular
society
he
did
so
with
an
ill
will
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
and
so
though
foote
was
the
nearest
size
to
bradlaugh
shoes
then
available
he
succeeded
him
at
the
disadvantage
of
inheriting
the
distrust
of
the
old
chief
robertson
you
know
he
was
not
a
mob
orator
watts
was
not
sufficient
he
had
neither
foote
weight
being
old
nor
robertson
scholarship
so
whilst
the
survivors
of
bradlaugh
were
trying
to
keep
up
the
hall
of
science
and
to
establish
a
memorial
library
etc
there
they
cast
round
for
new
blood
what
more
natural
than
that
they
should
think
of
me
as
a
man
not
afraid
to
call
himself
an
atheist
and
able
to
hold
his
own
on
the
platform
accordingly
they
invited
me
to
address
them
and
one
memorable
night
i
held
forth
on
progress
in
freethought
i
was
received
with
affectionate
hope
and
when
the
chairman
announced
that
i
was
giving
my
share
of
the
gate
to
the
memorial
library
i
have
never
taken
money
for
lecturing
the
enthusiasm
was
quite
touching
the
was
i
proceeded
to
smash
materialism
rationalism
and
all
the
philosophy
of
tyndall
helmholtz
darwin
and
the
rest
of
the
people
into
smithereens
i
ridiculed
and
exposed
every
inference
of
science
and
justified
every
dogma
of
religion
especially
showing
that
the
trinity
and
the
immaculate
conception
were
the
merest
common
sense
that
finished
me
up
as
a
possible
leader
of
the
robertson
came
on
the
platform
white
with
honest
scotch
rationalist
rage
and
denounced
me
with
a
fury
of
conviction
that
startled
his
own
followers
never
did
i
grace
that
platform
again
i
repeated
the
address
once
to
a
branch
of
the
on
the
south
side
of
the
thames
kensington
i
think
and
was
interrupted
by
yells
of
rage
from
the
veterans
of
the
society
the
leicester
secularists
a
pious
folk
rich
and
independent
of
the
were
kinder
to
me
but
they
were
no
more
real
atheists
than
the
congregation
of
paul
is
made
wholly
of
real
christians
foote
is
still
bewildered
about
me
imagining
that
i
am
a
pervert
but
anybody
who
reads
my
stuff
from
the
beginning
a
shelleyan
beginning
as
far
as
it
could
be
labelled
at
all
will
find
implicit
and
sometimes
explicit
the
views
which
in
their
more
matured
form
will
appear
in
that
remarkable
forthcoming
masterpiece
shavianism
a
religion
by
the
way
i
have
omitted
one
more
appearance
at
the
hall
of
science
at
a
four
nights
debate
on
socialism
between
foote
and
besant
i
took
the
chair
on
one
of
the
nights
i
take
advantage
of
a
snowy
sunday
afternoon
to
scribble
all
this
down
for
you
because
you
are
in
the
same
difficulty
that
beset
me
formerly
namely
the
absolute
blank
in
the
history
of
the
immediate
past
that
confronts
every
man
when
he
first
takes
to
public
life
written
history
stops
several
decades
back
and
the
bridge
of
personal
recollection
on
which
older
men
stand
does
not
exist
for
the
recruit
nothing
is
more
natural
than
that
you
should
reconstruct
me
as
the
last
of
the
rationalists
his
real
name
is
blatchford
and
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
it
would
be
much
nearer
the
truth
to
call
me
in
that
world
the
first
of
the
mystics
if
you
can
imagine
the
result
of
trying
to
write
your
spiritual
history
in
complete
ignorance
of
painting
you
will
get
a
notion
of
trying
to
write
mine
in
ignorance
of
music
bradlaugh
was
a
tremendous
platform
heavyweight
but
he
had
never
in
his
life
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
seen
anything
heard
anything
or
read
anything
in
the
artistic
sense
he
was
almost
beyond
belief
incapable
of
intercourse
in
private
conversation
he
could
tell
you
his
adventures
provided
you
did
interrupt
him
which
you
were
mostly
afraid
to
do
as
the
man
was
a
mesmeric
terror
but
as
to
exchanging
ideas
or
expressing
the
universal
part
of
his
soul
you
might
as
well
have
been
reading
the
letters
of
charles
dickens
to
his
family
those
tragic
monuments
of
dumbness
of
soul
and
noisiness
of
pen
lord
help
you
if
you
ever
lose
your
gift
of
speech
do
forget
that
the
race
is
only
struggling
out
of
its
dumbness
and
that
it
is
only
in
moments
of
inspiration
that
we
get
out
a
sentence
all
the
rest
is
padding
yours
ever
bernard
shaw
in
the
book
on
shaw
which
appeared
in
august
did
as
he
had
done
with
his
other
literary
studies
gave
inaccurately
only
as
much
biography
as
seemed
absolutely
necessary
and
mainly
discussed
ideas
he
saw
shaw
as
an
irishman
yet
lacking
the
roots
of
nationality
since
he
belonged
to
a
mainly
alien
governing
class
he
saw
him
as
a
puritan
yet
without
the
religious
basis
of
puritanism
and
thirdly
he
saw
him
as
so
swift
a
progressive
as
to
be
ahead
of
his
own
thought
and
ready
to
slay
it
in
the
name
of
progress
all
these
elements
in
shaw
made
for
strength
but
also
created
limitations
shaw
is
like
the
venus
of
milo
all
that
there
is
of
him
is
admirable
where
he
fails
is
in
being
unable
to
see
and
embrace
the
full
complexity
of
life
his
only
paradox
is
to
pull
out
one
thread
or
cord
of
truth
longer
and
longer
into
waste
and
fantastic
places
he
does
not
allow
for
that
deeper
sort
of
paradox
by
which
two
opposite
cords
of
truth
become
entangled
in
an
inextricable
knot
still
less
can
he
be
made
to
realise
that
it
is
often
this
knot
which
ties
safely
together
the
whole
bundle
of
human
life
here
lies
the
limitation
of
that
lucid
and
compelling
mind
he
can
not
quite
understand
life
because
he
will
not
accept
its
contradictions
humanity
is
built
of
these
contradictions
therefore
shaw
pities
humanity
more
than
he
loves
it
it
was
his
glory
that
he
pitied
animals
like
men
it
was
his
defect
that
he
pitied
men
almost
too
much
like
animals
foulon
said
of
the
democracy
them
eat
grass
shaw
said
them
eat
greens
he
had
more
benevolence
but
almost
as
much
disdain
as
a
vegetarian
and
a
water
drinker
shaw
himself
lacked
in
chesterton
eyes
something
of
complete
humanity
and
in
discussing
social
problems
he
was
more
economist
than
man
shaw
one
might
almost
say
dislikes
murder
not
so
much
because
it
wastes
the
life
of
the
corpse
as
because
it
wastes
the
time
of
the
murderer
this
lack
of
the
full
human
touch
is
felt
even
in
the
plays
because
shaw
can
not
be
irrational
where
humanity
always
is
irrational
in
it
is
completely
and
disastrously
false
to
the
whole
nature
of
falling
in
love
to
make
the
young
eugene
complain
of
the
cruelty
which
makes
candida
defile
her
fair
hands
with
domestic
duties
no
boy
in
love
with
a
beautiful
woman
would
ever
feel
disgusted
when
she
peeled
potatoes
or
trimmed
lamps
he
would
like
her
to
be
domestic
he
would
simply
feel
that
the
potatoes
had
become
poetical
and
the
lamps
gained
an
extra
light
this
may
be
irrational
but
we
are
not
talking
of
rationality
but
of
the
psychology
of
first
love
it
may
be
very
unfair
to
women
that
the
toil
and
triviality
of
should
be
seen
through
a
glamour
of
romance
but
the
glamour
is
quite
as
certain
a
fact
as
the
potatoes
it
may
be
a
bad
thing
in
sociology
that
men
should
deify
domesticity
in
girls
as
something
dainty
and
magical
but
all
men
do
personally
i
do
not
think
it
a
bad
thing
at
all
but
that
is
another
argument
no
two
love
affairs
are
the
same
this
sentence
assumed
that
they
are
all
the
same
to
eugene
the
poet
living
in
a
world
of
imagination
and
abhorring
reality
candida
was
what
dulcinea
was
to
don
quixote
bernard
pp
yet
shaw
limitations
are
those
of
a
great
man
and
a
genius
in
an
age
of
narrow
specialism
he
has
stood
up
for
the
fact
that
philosophy
is
not
the
concern
of
those
who
pass
through
divinity
and
greats
but
of
those
who
pass
through
birth
and
death
in
an
age
that
has
almost
chosen
death
shaw
follows
the
banner
of
life
but
austerely
not
joyously
nowhere
in
dealing
with
shaw
philosophy
does
chesterton
note
his
debt
to
butler
shaw
has
himself
mentioned
it
and
no
reader
of
butler
could
miss
it
especially
in
this
matter
of
the
life
force
it
is
the
special
paradox
of
our
age
chesterton
notes
that
the
life
force
should
thus
need
assertion
and
can
thus
be
followed
without
joy
to
every
man
and
woman
bird
beast
and
flower
life
is
a
to
be
eagerly
followed
to
bernard
shaw
it
is
merely
a
military
bugle
to
be
obeyed
in
short
he
fails
to
feel
that
the
command
of
nature
if
one
must
use
the
anthropomorphic
fable
of
nature
instead
of
the
philosophic
term
god
can
be
enjoyed
as
well
as
obeyed
he
paints
life
at
its
darkest
and
then
tells
the
babe
unborn
to
take
the
leap
in
the
dark
that
is
heroic
and
to
my
instinct
at
least
schopenhauer
looks
like
a
pigmy
beside
his
pupil
but
it
is
the
heroism
of
a
morbid
and
almost
asphyxiated
age
it
is
awful
to
think
that
this
world
which
so
many
poets
have
praised
has
even
for
a
time
been
depicted
as
a
into
which
we
may
just
have
the
manhood
to
jump
think
of
all
those
ages
through
which
men
have
talked
of
having
the
courage
to
die
and
then
remember
that
we
have
actually
fallen
to
talking
of
having
the
courage
to
live
bernard
library
p
here
comes
the
great
parting
of
the
two
men
thought
believed
in
god
and
in
joy
but
he
saw
that
shaw
had
much
of
value
for
this
strange
diseased
world
his
primary
value
was
not
merely
as
some
said
that
he
woke
it
up
the
literary
world
might
not
be
awake
to
the
social
evil
but
it
was
painfully
awake
to
the
ills
real
or
imaginary
inherent
in
human
life
we
do
not
need
waking
up
rather
we
suffer
from
insomnia
with
all
its
results
of
fear
and
exaggeration
and
frightful
waking
dreams
the
modern
mind
is
not
a
donkey
which
wants
kicking
to
make
it
go
on
the
modern
mind
is
more
like
a
on
a
lonely
road
which
two
amateur
motorists
have
been
just
clever
enough
to
take
to
pieces
but
are
not
quite
clever
enough
to
put
together
again
pp
shaw
had
not
merely
asked
questions
of
the
age
that
would
have
been
worse
than
useless
what
he
had
done
was
at
moments
to
rise
above
his
own
thoughts
and
give
through
his
characters
inspired
answers
instances
with
its
revelation
of
the
meaning
of
marriage
when
the
woman
stays
with
the
strong
man
because
he
is
so
weak
and
needs
her
and
shaw
had
brought
back
philosophy
into
drama
that
is
he
had
recreated
the
atmosphere
lost
since
shakespeare
in
which
men
were
thinking
and
might
therefore
find
the
answers
that
the
age
needed
and
here
again
we
come
back
to
the
world
which
these
men
were
shaking
and
to
the
respective
philosophies
with
which
they
looked
at
it
it
was
a
world
of
conventions
and
these
conventions
had
become
empty
of
meaning
throw
them
away
said
shaw
and
wells
no
said
chesterton
keep
them
and
look
for
their
meaning
revolution
does
not
mean
destruction
it
means
restoration
hard
on
goethe
and
ibsen
to
say
nothing
of
mozart
magic
flute
and
beethoven
symphony
the
same
sort
of
discussion
buzzed
around
this
book
as
around
the
controversies
of
which
it
might
be
called
a
prolongation
shaw
himself
reviewed
it
in
an
article
in
the
in
which
he
called
it
the
best
work
of
literary
art
i
have
yet
provoked
everything
about
me
which
chesterton
had
to
divine
he
has
divined
miraculously
but
everything
that
he
could
have
ascertained
easily
by
reading
my
own
plain
directions
on
the
bottle
as
it
were
remains
for
him
a
muddled
and
painful
problem
from
an
interchange
of
private
letters
it
would
seem
that
the
move
to
beaconsfield
took
place
later
in
this
year
than
i
had
supposed
bernard
shaw
letter
is
probably
not
written
many
days
after
an
undated
one
to
him
from
overstrand
mansions
battersea
park
dear
bernard
shaw
i
trust
our
recent
tournaments
have
not
rendered
it
contrary
to
the
laws
of
romantic
chivalry
which
you
reverence
so
much
for
me
to
introduce
to
you
my
friend
pepler
who
is
a
very
nice
man
indeed
though
a
social
idealist
and
who
has
i
believe
something
of
a
practical
sort
to
ask
of
you
please
excuse
abruptness
in
this
letter
of
introduction
we
are
moving
into
the
country
and
every
piece
of
furniture
i
begin
to
write
at
is
taken
away
and
put
into
a
van
always
yours
sincerely
chesterton
adelphi
terrace
october
chesterton
shaw
speaks
attention
i
saw
your
man
and
consoled
him
spiritually
but
that
is
not
the
subject
of
this
letter
i
still
think
that
you
could
write
a
useful
sort
of
play
if
you
were
started
when
i
was
in
kerry
last
month
i
had
occasionally
a
few
moments
to
spare
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
unendurable
that
you
should
be
wasting
your
time
writing
books
about
me
i
liked
the
book
very
much
especially
as
it
was
so
completely
free
from
my
own
influence
being
evidently
founded
on
a
very
hazy
recollection
of
a
perusal
of
man
and
superman
but
a
lot
of
it
was
fearful
nonsense
there
was
one
good
thing
about
the
scientific
superstition
which
you
came
a
little
too
late
for
it
taught
a
man
to
respect
facts
you
have
no
conscience
in
this
respect
and
your
punishment
is
that
you
substitute
such
dull
inferences
as
my
narrow
puritan
home
for
delightful
and
fantastic
realities
which
you
might
very
easily
have
ascertained
if
you
had
taken
greater
advantage
of
what
is
really
the
only
thing
to
be
said
in
favour
of
battersea
namely
that
it
is
within
easy
reach
of
adelphi
terrace
however
i
have
no
doubt
that
when
wilkins
micawber
junior
grew
up
and
became
eminent
in
australia
references
were
made
to
his
narrow
puritan
home
so
i
do
not
complain
if
you
had
told
the
truth
nobody
would
have
believed
it
now
to
business
when
one
breathes
irish
air
one
becomes
a
practical
man
in
england
i
used
to
say
what
a
pity
it
was
you
did
not
write
a
play
in
ireland
i
sat
down
and
began
writing
a
scenario
for
you
but
before
i
could
finish
it
i
had
come
back
to
london
and
now
it
is
all
up
with
the
scenario
in
england
i
can
do
nothing
but
talk
i
therefore
now
send
you
the
thing
as
far
as
i
scribbled
it
and
i
leave
you
to
invent
what
escapades
you
please
for
the
hero
and
to
devise
some
sensational
means
of
getting
him
back
to
heaven
again
unless
you
prefer
to
end
with
the
millennium
in
full
swing
the
scenario
dealt
with
the
return
of
augustine
to
the
england
he
remembered
converting
but
experience
has
made
me
very
doubtful
of
the
efficacy
of
help
as
the
means
of
getting
work
out
of
the
right
sort
of
man
when
i
was
young
i
struck
out
one
invaluable
rule
for
myself
which
was
whenever
you
meet
an
important
man
contradict
him
if
possible
insult
him
but
such
a
rule
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
youth
i
no
longer
live
by
rules
yet
there
is
one
way
in
which
you
may
possibly
be
insultable
it
can
be
plausibly
held
that
you
are
a
venal
ruffian
pouring
forth
great
quantities
of
immediately
saleable
stuff
but
altogether
declining
to
lay
up
for
yourself
treasures
in
heaven
it
may
be
that
you
can
not
afford
to
do
otherwise
therefore
i
am
quite
ready
to
make
a
deal
with
you
a
full
length
play
should
contain
about
words
mine
frequently
contain
two
or
three
times
that
number
i
do
not
know
what
your
price
per
thousand
is
i
used
to
be
considered
grossly
extortionate
by
massingham
and
others
for
insisting
on
words
at
per
thousand
is
i
need
make
no
extra
allowance
for
the
republication
in
book
form
because
even
if
the
play
aborted
as
far
as
the
theatre
is
concerned
you
could
make
a
book
of
it
all
the
same
let
us
assume
that
your
work
is
worth
twice
as
much
as
mine
this
would
make
i
have
had
two
shockingly
bad
years
of
it
pecuniarily
speaking
and
am
therefore
in
that
phase
of
extravagance
which
straitened
means
have
always
produced
in
me
knock
off
as
a
sort
of
agent
commission
to
me
for
starting
you
on
the
job
and
finding
you
a
theme
this
leaves
i
will
pay
you
down
on
your
contracting
to
supply
me
within
three
months
with
a
mechanically
possible
stageable
drama
dealing
with
the
experiences
of
augustine
after
england
the
literary
copyright
to
be
yours
except
that
you
are
not
to
prevent
me
making
as
many
copies
as
i
may
require
for
stage
use
the
stage
right
to
be
mine
but
you
are
to
have
the
right
to
buy
it
back
from
me
for
whenever
you
like
the
play
if
performed
to
be
announced
as
your
work
and
not
as
a
collaboration
all
rights
which
i
may
have
in
the
scenario
to
go
with
the
stage
right
and
literary
copyright
as
prescribed
as
far
as
you
may
make
use
of
it
what
do
you
say
there
is
a
lot
of
spending
in
i
could
not
very
well
offer
him
as
a
present
one
condition
more
if
it
should
prove
impossible
to
achieve
a
performance
otherwise
than
through
the
stage
society
which
does
not
pay
anything
a
resort
to
that
body
is
not
to
be
deemed
a
breach
of
the
spirit
of
our
agreement
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
to
make
belloc
write
a
comedy
if
he
could
only
be
induced
to
believe
in
some
sort
of
god
instead
of
in
that
wretched
little
conspiracy
against
religion
which
the
pious
romans
have
locked
up
in
the
vatican
one
could
get
some
drive
into
him
as
it
is
he
is
wasting
prodigious
gifts
in
the
service
of
king
leopold
and
the
pope
and
other
ghastly
scarecrows
if
he
must
have
a
pope
there
is
quite
a
possible
one
at
adelphi
terrace
for
the
next
few
days
i
shall
be
at
my
country
quarters
ayot
lawrence
welwyn
herts
i
have
a
motor
car
which
could
carry
me
on
sufficient
provocation
as
far
as
beaconsfield
but
i
do
not
know
how
much
time
you
spend
there
and
how
much
in
fleet
street
are
you
only
a
or
has
your
wise
wife
taken
you
properly
in
hand
and
committed
you
to
a
pastoral
life
yours
ever
bernard
shaw
remember
that
the
play
is
to
be
practical
in
the
common
managerial
sense
only
in
respect
of
its
being
mechanically
possible
as
a
stage
representation
it
is
to
be
neither
a
play
nor
a
literary
lark
it
is
to
be
written
for
the
good
of
all
souls
among
the
reviewers
of
the
book
our
old
friend
the
surprised
me
by
hating
shaw
so
much
more
than
chesterton
that
the
latter
came
off
quite
lightly
there
was
a
good
deal
of
the
usual
misunderstanding
and
lists
were
made
of
on
the
author
part
still
in
the
main
the
press
was
sympathetic
and
even
enthusiastic
but
when
shaw
reviewed
chesterton
on
shaw
more
than
one
paper
waxed
sarcastic
on
the
point
of
royalties
and
remuneration
gained
by
these
means
the
funniest
of
the
more
critical
comments
on
the
way
these
men
wrote
of
one
another
was
a
suggestion
made
in
the
that
shaw
and
chesterton
were
really
the
same
person
shaw
it
is
said
tired
of
socialism
weary
of
wearing
jaegers
and
broken
down
by
teetotalism
and
vegetarianism
sought
some
years
ago
an
escape
from
them
his
adoption
however
of
these
attitudes
had
a
decided
commercial
value
which
he
did
not
think
it
advisable
to
prejudice
by
wholesale
surrender
therefore
he
in
order
to
taste
the
forbidden
joys
of
individualistic
philosophy
meat
food
and
strong
drink
created
chesterton
this
mammoth
myth
he
decided
should
enjoy
all
the
forms
of
fame
which
shaw
had
to
deny
himself
outwardly
he
should
be
shaw
antithesis
he
should
be
beardless
large
in
girth
smiling
of
countenance
and
he
should
be
licensed
to
sell
paradoxes
only
in
essay
and
novel
form
all
stage
and
platform
rights
being
reserved
by
shaw
to
enable
the
imposition
to
be
safely
carried
out
shaw
hit
on
the
idea
of
residence
close
to
the
tunnel
which
connects
adelphi
with
the
strand
emerging
from
his
house
plain
bearded
and
saturnine
shaw
he
entered
the
tunnel
in
a
cleft
in
which
was
a
cellar
here
he
donned
the
chesterton
properties
the
immense
padding
of
chest
and
so
on
the
chesterton
sombrero
hat
and
cloak
and
and
there
he
left
the
shaw
beard
and
the
shaw
clothes
the
shaw
expression
of
countenance
and
all
the
shaw
theories
he
emerged
into
the
strand
in
whose
identity
he
visited
all
the
cafés
ate
all
the
meats
rode
in
all
the
cabs
and
smiled
on
all
the
sinners
the
work
done
the
chesterton
manuscripts
delivered
the
proofs
read
the
bargains
driven
the
giant
figure
returned
to
the
tunnel
and
once
again
was
back
in
adelphi
the
shaw
he
was
when
he
left
it
back
to
the
jaegers
the
beard
the
socialism
the
statistics
and
the
sardonic
letters
to
the
from
september
bernard
shaw
is
a
man
of
unusual
generosity
but
i
think
from
his
letters
he
must
also
be
quite
a
good
man
of
business
was
so
greatly
the
opposite
that
urged
him
again
and
again
to
do
the
most
ordinary
things
to
protect
the
literary
rights
of
himself
and
others
thus
in
the
only
undated
letter
in
the
whole
packet
he
begs
gilbert
to
back
up
the
authors
society
my
dear
i
am
one
of
the
unhappy
slaves
who
on
the
two
big
committees
of
your
trade
union
the
society
of
authors
drudge
at
the
heartbreaking
work
of
defending
our
miserable
profession
against
being
devoured
body
and
soul
by
the
publishers
themselves
a
pitiful
gang
of
impostors
who
are
crumpled
up
by
the
booksellers
who
though
small
folk
are
at
least
in
contact
with
reality
in
the
shape
of
the
book
buyer
it
is
a
ghastly
and
infuriating
business
because
the
authors
go
to
lunch
with
their
publishers
and
sell
them
anything
for
over
the
cigarettes
but
it
has
to
be
done
and
i
with
half
a
dozen
others
have
to
do
it
now
i
missed
the
last
committee
meeting
electioneering
i
am
here
doing
two
colossal
meetings
of
miners
every
night
for
keir
hardie
but
the
harassed
secretary
writes
that
it
was
decided
to
take
proceedings
in
the
case
of
a
book
of
yours
which
you
oh
esau
esau
sold
to
john
john
is
a
well
no
matter
when
you
take
your
turn
on
the
committee
you
will
find
him
out
and
that
though
the
german
lawyer
has
had
and
is
going
ahead
worth
of
law
in
germany
takes
you
to
the
house
of
lords
everything
is
hung
up
because
you
will
not
answer
letters
thring
in
desperation
appeals
to
me
concluding
with
characteristic
simplicity
that
we
must
be
friends
because
you
have
written
a
book
about
me
as
the
conclusion
is
accidentally
and
improbably
true
i
now
urge
you
to
give
him
whatever
satisfaction
he
requires
i
have
no
notion
what
it
is
or
what
the
case
is
about
but
at
least
answer
his
letters
however
infuriating
they
may
be
remember
you
pay
thring
only
for
which
you
get
integrity
incorruptibility
implacability
and
a
disposition
greatly
to
find
quarrel
in
a
straw
on
your
behalf
even
with
yourself
and
do
complain
if
you
do
get
worth
of
tact
into
the
bargain
and
your
obligations
to
us
wretched
committee
men
are
simply
incalculable
we
get
nothing
but
abuse
and
denigration
authors
weep
with
indignation
when
we
put
our
foot
on
some
orphan
starving
scoundrel
and
ruthlessly
force
him
to
keep
to
his
mite
of
obligation
under
an
agreement
which
would
have
revolted
shylock
unless
the
best
men
the
good
professionals
help
us
we
are
lost
we
get
nothing
and
spend
our
time
like
water
for
you
herbert
thring
was
the
barrister
employed
by
the
society
of
authors
all
we
ask
you
to
do
is
to
answer
thring
and
let
us
get
along
with
your
work
look
here
will
you
write
to
thring
write
to
thring
i
say
have
you
written
to
thring
yet
i
doubt
whether
he
had
those
chance
sums
he
poured
from
time
to
time
into
frances
lap
were
usually
not
what
they
should
have
been
an
advance
on
a
royalty
he
sold
outright
for
no
man
ever
worked
so
hard
to
earn
so
little
when
later
gilbert
employed
watt
as
his
literary
agents
a
letter
to
them
undated
of
course
and
written
on
the
old
notepaper
of
his
first
battersea
flat
shows
a
mingling
of
gratitude
to
his
agents
with
entire
absence
of
resentment
towards
his
publishers
which
might
be
called
essence
of
chesterton
the
prices
you
have
got
me
for
books
compared
with
what
i
used
weakly
to
demand
seem
to
me
to
come
out
of
fairyland
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
genuine
business
problem
which
creates
a
permanent
need
for
a
literary
agent
it
consists
in
this
that
our
work
even
when
it
has
become
entirely
a
duty
and
a
worry
still
remains
in
some
vague
way
a
pleasure
and
how
can
we
put
a
fair
price
on
what
is
at
once
a
worry
and
a
pleasure
suppose
someone
comes
to
me
and
says
i
offer
you
sixpence
for
your
of
the
gnostic
why
after
all
should
i
charge
more
than
sixpence
for
a
work
it
was
so
exuberant
to
write
you
on
the
other
hand
seeing
it
from
the
outside
would
say
that
it
was
worth
so
and
so
and
you
would
get
it
shaw
continued
his
attempts
to
stimulate
the
reluctant
playwright
two
years
after
drafting
the
scenario
he
writes
adelphi
terrace
april
dear
chesterton
i
have
promised
to
drive
somebody
to
beaconsfield
on
sunday
morning
and
i
shall
be
in
that
district
more
or
less
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
you
are
spending
easter
at
overroads
and
have
no
visitors
who
could
stand
us
we
should
like
to
call
on
you
at
any
time
that
would
be
convenient
the
convenience
of
time
depends
on
a
design
of
my
own
which
i
wish
to
impart
to
you
first
i
want
to
read
a
play
to
gilbert
it
began
by
way
of
being
a
sketch
so
it
is
not
hours
long
as
usual
i
can
get
through
it
in
an
hour
and
a
half
i
want
to
insult
and
taunt
and
stimulate
gilbert
with
it
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
he
could
write
and
ought
to
write
a
religious
harlequinade
in
fact
he
could
do
it
better
if
a
sufficient
number
of
pins
were
stuck
into
him
my
proposal
is
that
i
read
the
play
to
him
on
sunday
or
at
the
next
convenient
date
and
that
you
fall
into
transports
of
admiration
of
it
declare
that
you
can
never
love
a
man
who
can
not
write
things
like
that
and
definitely
announce
that
if
gilbert
has
not
finished
a
worthy
successor
to
it
before
the
end
of
the
third
week
next
ensuing
you
will
go
out
like
the
lady
in
a
doll
house
and
live
your
own
life
whatever
that
dark
threat
may
mean
androcles
and
the
lion
evidently
if
you
are
at
home
i
count
on
your
ready
complicity
but
the
difficulty
is
that
you
may
have
visitors
and
if
they
are
pious
gilbert
will
be
under
a
tacit
obligation
not
to
blaspheme
or
let
me
blaspheme
whilst
they
are
beneath
his
roof
my
play
is
about
christian
martyrs
and
perfectly
awful
in
parts
and
if
they
are
journalists
it
will
be
necessary
to
administer
an
oath
of
secrecy
i
do
object
to
the
oath
and
nothing
would
please
gilbert
more
than
to
make
them
drink
blood
from
a
skull
the
difficulty
is
they
would
keep
it
in
short
they
must
be
the
right
sort
of
people
of
whom
the
more
the
merrier
forgive
this
long
rigmarole
it
is
only
to
put
you
in
possession
of
what
happen
if
you
approve
and
your
invitations
and
domestic
circumstances
are
propitious
yours
sincerely
bernard
shaw
chesterton
at
last
did
write
but
that
belongs
to
another
chapter
like
the
demand
for
a
play
the
theme
of
finance
recurs
with
great
frequency
in
shaw
letters
and
after
appeared
he
wrote
to
frances
telling
her
that
in
sweden
where
the
marriage
laws
are
comparatively
enlightened
i
believe
you
could
obtain
a
divorce
on
the
ground
that
your
husband
threw
away
an
important
part
of
the
provision
for
your
old
age
for
twenty
pieces
of
silver
in
future
the
moment
he
has
finished
a
play
and
the
question
of
disposing
of
it
arises
lock
him
up
and
bring
the
agreement
to
me
explanations
would
be
thrown
away
on
him
chapter
xv
from
battersea
to
beaconsfield
in
with
well
behind
him
and
bernard
just
published
gilbert
and
his
wife
left
london
for
the
small
country
town
that
was
to
be
their
home
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
that
they
should
leave
overstrand
mansions
battersea
and
come
to
overroads
beaconsfield
for
they
did
not
name
their
new
home
but
found
it
ready
christened
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
one
of
the
letters
during
the
engagement
gilbert
had
suggested
a
country
home
the
reason
for
the
choice
of
beaconsfield
he
gives
in
the
after
we
were
married
my
wife
and
i
lived
for
about
a
year
in
kensington
the
place
of
my
childhood
but
i
think
we
both
knew
that
it
was
not
to
be
the
real
place
for
our
abode
i
remember
that
we
strolled
out
one
day
for
a
sort
of
second
honeymoon
and
went
upon
a
journey
into
the
void
a
voyage
deliberately
objectless
i
saw
a
passing
omnibus
labelled
hanwell
and
feeling
this
to
be
an
appropriate
omen
we
boarded
it
and
left
it
somewhere
at
a
stray
station
which
i
entered
and
asked
the
man
in
the
where
the
next
train
went
to
he
uttered
the
pedantic
reply
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
and
i
uttered
the
profound
and
philosophical
rejoinder
wherever
the
next
train
goes
to
it
seemed
that
it
went
to
slough
which
may
seem
to
be
singular
taste
even
in
a
train
however
we
went
to
slough
and
from
there
set
out
walking
with
even
less
notion
of
where
we
were
going
and
in
that
fashion
we
passed
through
the
large
and
quiet
of
a
sort
of
village
and
stayed
at
an
inn
called
the
white
hart
we
asked
the
name
of
the
place
and
were
told
that
it
was
called
beaconsfield
i
mean
of
course
that
it
was
called
beconsfield
and
not
beaconsfield
and
we
said
to
each
other
this
is
the
sort
of
place
where
some
day
we
will
make
our
home
at
hanwell
is
london
most
famous
lunatic
asylum
p
they
both
wanted
a
home
they
both
deeply
desired
a
family
the
wish
is
normal
to
both
man
and
woman
normal
in
a
happy
marriage
and
theirs
was
unusually
happy
it
was
almost
abnormally
keen
in
both
frances
and
gilbert
few
men
have
so
greatly
loved
children
as
a
schoolboy
his
letters
are
full
of
it
making
friends
with
scottish
children
on
the
sands
with
french
children
by
the
medium
of
pictures
later
he
was
writing
in
defence
of
baby
worship
and
welcoming
with
enthusiasm
the
arrival
of
his
friends
children
into
the
world
in
the
notebook
he
had
written
sunlight
in
a
child
hair
it
is
like
the
kiss
of
christ
upon
all
children
i
blessed
the
child
and
hoped
the
blessing
would
go
with
him
and
never
leave
him
and
turn
first
into
a
toy
and
then
into
a
game
and
then
into
a
friend
and
as
he
grew
up
into
friends
and
then
into
a
woman
grass
and
children
grass
and
children
there
seems
no
end
to
them
but
if
there
were
but
one
blade
of
grass
men
would
see
that
it
is
fairer
than
lilies
and
if
we
saw
the
first
child
we
should
worship
it
as
the
god
come
on
earth
rounds
i
find
that
most
round
things
are
nice
particularly
eternity
and
a
baby
frances
cared
no
less
deeply
both
for
eternity
and
for
babies
and
for
many
years
went
on
hoping
for
the
family
that
would
complete
their
lives
at
last
it
was
decided
to
have
an
operation
to
enable
her
to
have
children
her
doctor
writes
i
well
remember
an
incident
which
occurred
during
her
convalescence
from
that
operation
i
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
matron
of
the
nursing
home
in
which
chesterton
was
staying
suggesting
that
i
should
come
round
and
remonstrate
with
chesterton
on
my
arrival
i
found
him
sitting
on
the
stairs
where
he
had
been
for
two
hours
greatly
incommoding
passers
up
and
down
and
deaf
to
all
requests
to
move
on
it
appeared
that
he
had
written
a
sonnet
to
his
wife
on
her
recovery
from
the
operation
and
was
bringing
it
to
give
her
he
was
not
however
satisfied
with
the
last
line
but
was
determined
to
perfect
it
before
entering
her
room
to
take
tea
with
her
by
the
time
they
left
london
she
must
i
think
have
given
up
the
hope
she
had
so
long
cherished
still
if
there
could
not
be
children
there
might
be
perhaps
something
of
a
home
in
the
conditions
of
their
life
there
was
danger
that
any
house
of
bricks
and
mortar
should
be
rather
a
headquarters
than
a
home
and
it
was
lucky
that
he
was
able
to
feel
she
took
home
with
her
wherever
they
went
your
face
that
is
a
wandering
home
a
flying
home
for
me
the
years
before
them
were
to
be
filled
with
the
vast
activities
that
not
only
took
gilbert
to
london
and
all
over
england
incessantly
but
were
to
take
him
increasingly
over
europe
and
america
beaconsfield
gave
a
degree
of
quiet
that
made
it
possible
when
they
were
able
to
be
at
home
not
to
be
swamped
by
engagements
and
to
lead
a
life
of
their
own
gilbert
could
go
to
london
when
he
liked
but
he
need
not
always
be
on
tap
so
to
say
for
all
the
world
frances
could
have
a
garden
and
indulge
her
hungry
appetite
for
all
that
was
fruitful
later
under
the
title
the
homelessness
of
jones
showed
his
love
for
a
house
rather
than
a
flat
and
they
gave
even
to
their
first
little
house
overroads
the
stamp
of
a
real
home
a
chapter
in
wrong
with
the
for
a
man
and
his
wife
to
leave
london
for
the
country
might
seem
to
be
their
own
affair
not
so
however
with
the
chestertons
after
a
lapse
of
over
thirty
years
i
find
the
matter
still
a
subject
of
furious
controversy
and
indeed
passion
frances
says
one
school
of
opinion
committed
a
crime
against
the
public
good
by
removing
gilbert
from
fleet
street
no
says
the
other
school
she
had
to
move
him
or
he
would
have
died
of
working
too
hard
and
drinking
too
much
the
suggestion
which
i
believe
to
be
a
fact
that
gilbert
himself
wanted
to
move
is
seldom
entertained
there
is
in
all
this
the
legitimate
feeling
of
distress
among
any
group
at
losing
its
chief
figure
its
pride
and
joy
i
lost
gilbert
lucian
oldershaw
once
said
first
when
i
introduced
him
to
belloc
next
when
he
married
frances
and
finally
when
he
joined
the
catholic
church
i
rejoiced
though
perhaps
with
a
maternal
sadness
at
all
these
fulfillments
cecil
wanted
his
brother
always
on
hand
belloc
was
already
in
the
country
a
far
more
remote
country
but
even
he
coming
up
to
london
mourned
to
my
mother
she
has
taken
my
chesterton
from
me
talking
it
over
however
after
the
lapse
of
years
he
agreed
that
in
all
probability
the
move
was
a
wise
one
what
may
be
called
the
smaller
fry
of
fleet
street
are
less
reasonable
one
can
not
avoid
the
feeling
that
in
all
this
masculine
life
so
sure
of
its
manhood
there
lingered
something
of
the
schwärmerei
of
the
junior
debating
club
furiously
desiring
each
to
be
first
with
gilbert
and
in
his
love
of
fleet
street
he
so
identified
himself
with
them
all
that
they
felt
he
was
one
of
them
and
did
not
recognise
the
horizons
wider
than
theirs
that
were
opening
before
him
my
husband
and
i
are
experts
in
changing
residences
and
we
listened
with
the
amusement
of
experts
to
the
talk
of
theorists
for
it
was
so
constantly
assumed
that
on
one
side
of
a
choice
is
disaster
on
the
other
perfection
actually
perfection
does
not
belong
to
this
earthly
state
if
you
go
to
rome
as
gilbert
himself
once
said
you
sacrifice
a
rich
suggestive
life
at
wimbledon
newman
writing
of
a
far
greater
and
more
irrevocable
choice
called
his
story
and
but
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
gain
outweighed
the
loss
there
were
in
gilbert
adult
life
three
other
big
decisions
decisions
of
the
scale
that
altered
its
course
the
first
was
his
marriage
the
second
was
his
reception
into
the
church
the
third
was
his
continued
dedication
to
the
paper
that
his
brother
and
belloc
had
founded
in
deciding
to
marry
frances
he
was
acting
against
his
mother
wishes
to
which
he
was
extremely
sensitive
his
decision
to
become
a
catholic
had
to
be
made
alone
he
had
the
sympathy
of
his
wife
but
not
her
companionship
in
the
decision
to
edit
the
paper
he
had
not
even
fully
her
sympathy
she
always
felt
his
creative
work
to
be
so
much
more
important
and
to
be
imperilled
by
the
overwork
the
paper
brought
gilbert
was
a
man
slow
in
action
but
it
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
find
instances
of
his
doing
anything
that
he
did
not
want
to
do
the
theorists
about
marriage
are
like
the
theorists
about
moving
house
if
they
do
not
know
that
decisions
made
by
one
party
alone
are
rare
indeed
and
stick
out
like
spikes
in
the
life
of
a
normal
and
happy
couple
of
the
vast
majority
of
decisions
it
is
hard
to
say
who
makes
them
they
make
themselves
after
endless
talk
on
the
tops
of
omnibuses
going
to
hanwell
or
elsewhere
out
walking
breakfasting
especially
breakfasting
in
bed
they
make
themselves
above
all
in
the
matter
of
a
move
in
fine
weather
during
a
holiday
on
a
hot
london
sunday
when
a
flat
is
stuffy
when
the
telephone
rings
all
day
when
a
book
is
on
the
stocks
other
writers
have
left
london
that
they
might
create
at
leisure
and
choose
their
own
times
for
social
intercourse
why
does
no
one
say
their
wives
dragged
them
away
simply
i
think
that
being
less
kind
and
considerate
than
gilbert
they
do
not
mind
telling
their
friends
that
they
are
not
always
wanted
this
gilbert
could
not
do
if
people
said
how
they
would
miss
him
how
they
hated
his
going
he
would
murmur
vague
and
friendly
sounds
from
which
they
deduced
all
they
wanted
to
deduce
was
it
more
weakness
or
strength
that
tenderness
of
heart
that
could
never
faintly
suggest
to
his
friends
that
they
would
miss
him
more
than
he
would
miss
them
i
never
wanted
but
one
thing
in
my
life
he
had
written
to
annie
firmin
and
that
one
thing
he
was
taking
with
him
anyhow
the
move
accomplished
he
enjoyed
defending
it
in
every
detail
and
did
so
especially
in
his
articles
the
rush
to
the
country
was
not
uncommon
in
the
literary
world
of
the
moment
and
his
journalist
friends
had
urged
the
point
that
beaconsfield
was
not
true
country
was
suburban
was
being
built
over
his
friends
replied
were
suffering
from
a
swing
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
men
who
had
praised
london
as
the
only
place
to
live
in
were
now
vying
with
one
another
to
live
furthest
from
a
station
to
have
no
chimneys
visible
on
the
most
distant
horizon
to
depend
on
tradesmen
who
only
called
once
a
week
from
cities
so
distant
that
loaves
grew
stale
before
delivery
rival
ruralists
would
quarrel
about
which
had
the
most
completely
inconvenient
postal
service
and
there
were
many
jealous
heartburnings
if
one
friend
found
out
any
uncomfortable
situation
which
the
other
friend
had
thoughtlessly
overlooked
gilbert
on
the
contrary
noted
soon
after
his
arrival
that
beaconsfield
was
beginning
to
be
built
over
and
he
noted
it
with
satisfaction
within
a
stone
throw
of
my
house
they
are
building
another
house
i
am
glad
they
are
building
it
and
i
am
glad
it
is
within
a
stone
throw
he
did
not
want
a
desert
he
did
not
want
a
large
landed
estate
he
wanted
what
he
had
got
a
house
and
a
garden
he
adventurously
explored
that
garden
finding
a
that
had
somehow
got
attached
to
the
premises
and
wondering
why
he
liked
it
speaking
to
the
gardener
an
enterprise
of
no
little
valour
and
asking
him
the
name
of
a
strange
dark
red
rose
at
once
theatrical
and
sulky
which
turned
out
to
be
called
victor
hugo
watching
with
regret
a
lot
of
little
black
pigs
being
turned
out
of
my
garden
watching
the
neighbouring
house
grow
up
from
its
foundation
he
noted
in
an
article
called
the
wings
of
stone
what
was
the
reality
of
a
staircase
we
pad
them
with
carpets
and
rail
them
with
banisters
yet
every
staircase
is
truly
only
an
awful
and
naked
ladder
running
up
into
the
infinite
to
a
deadly
height
a
correspondent
pointed
out
in
a
letter
to
the
that
here
he
had
touched
a
reality
keenly
felt
by
primitive
peoples
when
cetewayo
king
of
zululand
visited
london
he
would
go
upstairs
only
on
hands
and
knees
and
that
with
manifest
terror
the
paddings
of
civilisation
may
be
useful
yet
gilbert
held
more
valuable
a
realisation
of
the
realities
of
things
vision
is
not
fancy
but
the
sight
of
truth
in
the
notebook
he
had
written
there
are
three
things
that
make
me
think
things
beyond
all
poetry
a
yellow
space
or
rift
in
evening
sky
a
chimney
or
pinnacle
high
in
the
air
and
a
path
over
a
hill
chesterton
had
always
the
power
of
conveying
in
words
a
vision
of
some
unforgettable
scene
with
the
poet
words
for
what
the
artist
not
only
sees
but
imagines
such
flashes
became
more
frequent
as
he
looked
through
the
doorway
of
his
little
house
go
through
ball
and
the
with
this
in
mind
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
the
crimson
seas
of
the
sunset
seemed
to
him
like
a
bursting
out
of
some
sacred
blood
as
if
the
heart
of
the
world
had
broken
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
than
thus
to
look
as
it
were
through
the
archway
of
a
house
as
if
the
open
sky
were
an
interior
chamber
and
the
sun
a
secret
lamp
of
the
place
best
of
all
to
illustrate
this
special
quality
is
a
longer
passage
from
the
and
the
for
the
most
part
he
was
contented
to
see
the
green
semicircles
of
lawn
repeat
themselves
like
a
pattern
of
green
moons
for
he
was
not
one
to
whom
repetition
was
merely
monotony
only
in
looking
over
a
particular
gate
at
a
particular
lawn
he
became
pleasantly
conscious
or
half
conscious
of
a
new
note
of
colour
in
the
greenness
a
much
bluer
green
which
seemed
to
change
to
vivid
blue
as
the
object
at
which
he
was
gazing
moved
sharply
turning
a
small
head
on
a
long
neck
it
was
a
peacock
but
he
had
thought
of
a
thousand
things
before
he
thought
of
the
obvious
thing
the
burning
blue
of
the
plumage
on
the
neck
had
reminded
him
of
blue
fire
and
blue
fire
had
reminded
him
of
some
dark
fantasy
about
blue
devils
before
he
had
fully
realised
even
that
it
was
a
peacock
he
was
staring
at
and
the
tail
that
trailing
tapestry
of
eyes
had
led
his
wandering
wits
away
to
those
dark
but
divine
monsters
of
the
apocalypse
whose
eyes
were
multiplied
like
their
wings
before
he
had
remembered
that
a
peacock
even
in
a
more
practical
sense
was
an
odd
thing
to
see
in
so
ordinary
a
setting
yet
always
to
chesterton
the
beauty
of
nature
was
enhanced
by
the
work
of
men
and
if
in
london
men
had
swarmed
too
closely
it
was
not
to
get
away
from
them
but
to
appreciate
them
more
individually
that
he
chose
the
country
yes
his
literary
friends
would
say
in
the
real
country
that
is
true
the
farmer
the
labourer
even
the
village
barber
and
the
village
tradesmen
are
worth
knowing
but
not
suburban
neighbours
against
such
discrimination
the
whole
democracy
of
chesterton
stood
in
revolt
all
men
were
valuable
all
men
were
interesting
the
doctor
as
much
as
the
barber
the
clergyman
as
much
as
the
farmer
all
men
were
children
of
god
and
citizens
of
the
world
if
he
had
a
choice
in
the
matter
it
was
discrimination
against
the
literary
world
itself
with
all
the
fads
that
tended
to
smother
its
essential
humanity
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
discriminate
against
the
suburban
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
wrote
in
the
i
have
lived
in
beaconsfield
from
the
time
when
it
was
almost
a
village
to
the
time
when
as
the
enemy
profanely
says
it
is
a
suburb
for
the
author
of
napoleon
of
notting
this
would
hardly
be
a
conclusive
argument
against
any
place
we
should
he
once
said
regard
the
important
suburbs
as
ancient
cities
embedded
in
a
sort
of
boiling
lava
spouted
up
by
that
volcano
the
speculative
builder
that
lava
itself
he
found
interesting
but
beneath
or
beside
it
a
little
town
like
beaconsfield
had
its
share
in
the
great
sweep
of
english
history
something
of
the
seven
sunken
englands
could
be
found
in
the
old
town
which
custom
marked
off
pretty
sharply
from
the
new
town
burke
had
lived
in
beaconsfield
and
was
buried
there
and
gilbert
once
suggested
to
garvin
that
they
should
appear
at
a
local
festival
respectively
as
fox
a
part
for
which
i
have
no
claim
except
in
circumference
and
burke
i
admire
burke
in
many
things
while
disagreeing
with
him
in
nearly
everything
but
garvin
strikes
me
as
being
rather
like
burke
at
the
barber
he
was
often
seen
sitting
at
the
end
of
a
line
patiently
awaiting
his
turn
for
he
could
never
shave
himself
and
it
was
only
years
later
that
dorothy
collins
conceived
and
put
into
execution
the
bold
project
of
bringing
the
barber
to
the
house
probably
an
article
would
be
shaping
while
he
waited
and
the
conversation
might
put
the
finishing
touches
to
it
there
were
in
fact
two
barbers
one
of
the
old
town
one
of
the
new
i
once
planned
he
says
a
massive
and
exhaustive
sociological
work
in
several
volumes
which
was
to
be
called
two
barbers
of
beaconsfield
and
based
entirely
upon
the
talk
of
the
two
excellent
citizens
to
whom
i
went
to
get
shaved
for
those
two
shops
do
indeed
belong
to
two
different
civilisations
despite
his
love
for
london
gilbert
had
always
felt
that
life
in
a
country
town
held
one
point
of
special
superiority
in
it
you
discovered
the
community
in
london
you
chose
your
friends
which
meant
that
you
narrowed
your
life
to
people
of
one
kind
he
had
noted
in
the
family
itself
a
valuable
widening
the
supreme
adventure
is
being
born
there
we
do
walk
suddenly
into
a
splendid
and
startling
trap
there
we
do
see
something
of
which
we
have
not
dreamed
before
our
father
and
mother
do
lie
in
wait
for
us
and
leap
out
on
us
like
brigands
from
a
bush
our
uncle
is
a
surprise
our
aunt
is
in
the
beautiful
common
expression
a
bolt
from
the
blue
when
we
step
into
the
family
by
the
act
of
being
born
we
do
step
into
a
world
which
is
incalculable
into
a
world
which
has
its
own
strange
laws
into
a
world
which
could
do
without
us
into
a
world
that
we
have
not
made
pp
here
in
beaconsfield
the
chestertons
grew
into
the
community
the
clergyman
the
doctor
the
the
barber
the
gardener
and
like
the
relatives
who
spring
upon
you
at
birth
these
worthy
citizens
seemed
to
gilbert
potentials
of
vast
excitement
and
varied
interest
discussing
an
event
of
much
later
date
a
meeting
to
decide
whether
a
crucifix
might
be
erected
as
a
local
war
memorial
he
thus
describes
the
immense
forces
he
found
in
that
small
place
those
who
debated
the
matter
were
a
little
group
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
little
country
town
the
rector
and
the
doctor
and
the
bank
manager
and
the
respectable
tradesmen
of
the
place
with
a
few
like
myself
of
the
more
disreputable
professions
of
journalism
or
the
arts
but
the
powers
that
were
present
there
in
the
spirit
came
out
of
all
the
ages
and
all
the
battlefields
of
history
mahomet
was
there
and
the
iconoclasts
who
came
riding
out
of
the
east
to
ruin
the
statues
of
italy
and
calvin
and
rousseau
and
the
russian
anarchs
and
all
the
older
england
that
is
buried
under
puritanism
and
henry
the
third
ordering
the
little
images
for
westminster
and
henry
the
fifth
after
agincourt
on
his
knees
before
the
shrines
of
paris
if
one
could
really
write
that
little
story
of
that
little
place
it
would
be
the
greatest
of
historical
monographs
p
a
keen
observer
often
added
to
the
beaconsfield
community
in
those
days
was
father
now
monsignor
john
close
friend
of
both
gilbert
and
frances
and
inspirer
of
father
brown
of
detective
fame
they
had
first
become
friends
in
when
they
met
at
the
house
of
a
friend
in
keighley
yorkshire
and
walked
back
over
the
moors
together
to
visit
francis
steinthal
at
ilkley
this
jew
of
frankfort
descent
was
a
great
friend
of
the
chestertons
and
on
their
many
visits
to
him
the
friendship
with
father
ripened
with
both
frances
and
gilbert
it
was
among
the
closest
of
their
lives
their
letters
to
him
show
it
the
long
talks
and
companionable
walks
over
the
moors
have
an
atmosphere
of
intimacy
that
is
all
the
more
convincing
because
so
little
stressed
in
his
book
father
has
a
pardonable
pride
in
the
idea
that
their
talks
suggested
ideas
to
gilbert
he
takes
pleasure
in
his
character
of
father
brown
but
he
reveals
the
atmosphere
of
unique
confidence
and
intimacy
by
the
very
absence
of
all
parade
of
it
both
he
and
gilbert
have
told
the
story
of
how
the
idea
of
the
detective
priest
first
dawned
on
their
second
meeting
father
had
startled
indeed
almost
shattered
gilbert
with
certain
rather
lurid
knowledge
of
human
depravity
which
he
had
acquired
in
the
course
of
his
priestly
experience
at
the
house
to
which
they
were
going
two
cambridge
undergraduates
spoke
disparagingly
of
the
cloistered
habits
of
the
catholic
clergy
saying
that
to
them
it
seemed
that
to
know
and
meet
evil
was
a
far
better
thing
than
the
innocence
of
such
ignorance
to
gilbert
still
under
the
shock
of
a
knowledge
compared
with
which
these
two
cambridge
gentlemen
knew
about
as
much
of
real
evil
as
two
babies
in
the
same
perambulator
the
exquisite
irony
of
this
remark
suggested
a
thought
why
not
a
whole
comedy
of
cross
purposes
based
on
the
notion
of
a
priest
with
a
knowledge
of
evil
deeper
than
that
of
the
criminal
he
is
converting
he
carried
out
this
idea
in
the
story
of
the
blue
cross
the
first
father
brown
detective
story
father
account
adds
the
details
that
he
had
himself
once
boasted
of
buying
five
sapphires
for
five
shillings
and
that
he
always
carried
a
large
umbrella
and
many
brown
paper
parcels
at
the
steinthal
dining
table
an
artist
friend
of
the
family
made
a
sketch
of
father
which
later
appeared
on
the
wrapper
of
innocence
of
father
beyond
one
or
two
touches
of
this
sort
the
idea
had
been
a
suggestion
for
a
character
not
a
portrait
and
in
the
and
in
the
gilbert
has
a
good
deal
to
say
of
interest
to
the
novelist
about
how
such
suggestions
come
and
are
used
he
never
believed
that
dickens
drew
a
portrait
as
it
were
in
the
round
nature
just
gives
hints
to
the
creative
artist
and
it
used
to
amuse
father
brown
to
find
that
such
touches
of
observation
as
noting
where
an
had
got
hidden
behind
a
book
seemed
to
gilbert
quasi
miraculous
left
to
himself
he
merely
dropped
ashes
on
the
floor
from
his
cigar
he
did
not
smoke
a
pipe
and
cigarettes
were
prone
to
set
him
on
fire
in
one
place
or
another
a
frequent
visitor
father
noted
his
fashion
of
work
and
reading
and
the
abstracted
way
he
often
moved
and
spoke
call
it
mooning
but
he
never
mooned
he
was
always
working
out
something
in
his
mind
and
when
he
drifted
from
his
study
to
the
garden
and
was
seen
making
deadly
passes
with
his
at
the
dahlias
we
knew
that
he
had
got
to
a
dead
end
in
his
composition
and
was
getting
his
thoughts
into
order
he
played
often
too
with
a
huge
knife
which
he
had
for
years
he
took
it
abroad
with
him
took
it
to
bed
frances
had
to
retrieve
it
often
from
under
his
pillow
in
some
hotel
once
at
a
lecture
in
dublin
he
drew
it
to
sharpen
a
pencil
as
it
was
seven
and
a
half
inches
long
shut
and
fourteen
open
the
amusement
of
the
audience
may
be
imagined
in
origin
it
was
father
relates
a
texan
or
mexican
general
utility
implement
it
was
with
this
knife
that
he
won
my
daughter
heart
many
years
later
when
she
aged
three
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
and
had
grown
shy
of
him
a
little
scared
of
his
enormousness
she
stood
far
off
he
did
not
look
in
her
direction
but
began
to
open
and
shut
the
vast
blade
next
she
was
on
his
knee
a
little
later
we
heard
her
remark
uncle
gilbert
you
make
jokes
just
like
my
daddy
and
from
him
came
i
do
my
best
the
prototype
of
father
brown
tells
of
the
easy
job
in
detection
when
gilbert
had
been
reading
a
book
he
had
just
been
reading
a
shilling
pamphlet
by
horton
on
the
roman
menace
or
some
such
fearful
wild
fowl
i
knew
he
had
read
it
because
no
one
else
could
when
he
had
done
most
of
his
books
as
and
when
read
had
gone
through
every
indignity
a
book
may
suffer
and
live
he
turned
it
inside
out
it
pencilled
it
sat
on
it
took
it
to
bed
and
rolled
on
it
and
got
up
again
and
spilled
tea
on
it
if
he
were
sufficiently
interested
so
horton
pamphlet
had
a
refuted
look
when
i
saw
it
father
was
not
the
only
friend
who
was
added
to
the
beaconsfield
group
with
some
frequency
it
was
easy
enough
to
run
down
from
london
or
over
from
welwyn
home
of
or
from
oxford
or
cambridge
it
was
most
conveniently
central
gilbert
brethren
of
the
pen
were
especially
apt
to
appear
at
all
seasons
and
always
found
friendly
welcome
for
he
continued
to
call
himself
neither
poet
nor
philosopher
but
journalist
father
had
tried
to
persuade
him
as
he
neatly
puts
it
to
begin
to
print
on
handmade
paper
with
gilt
edges
but
frances
begged
him
to
drop
the
idea
you
will
not
change
gilbert
you
will
only
fidget
him
he
is
bent
on
being
a
jolly
journalist
to
paint
the
town
red
and
he
does
not
need
style
to
do
that
all
he
wants
is
buckets
and
buckets
of
red
paint
journalists
coming
down
from
london
describe
the
jolly
welcome
beer
poured
the
flourished
conversation
flowing
as
freely
as
the
beer
it
meant
a
pleasant
afternoon
and
it
meant
good
copy
they
visited
him
in
the
country
they
observed
him
in
town
one
interviewer
returned
with
a
photo
which
showed
chesterton
in
a
somewhat
négligé
condition
the
result
as
he
admitted
of
reading
jacobs
rolling
about
on
the
floor
waving
his
legs
in
the
air
he
was
seen
working
a
swan
boat
at
the
white
city
he
collapsed
it
and
the
placid
lake
became
a
raging
sea
he
was
seen
thinking
and
even
reading
under
the
strangest
weather
conditions
one
man
saw
him
under
a
gas
lamp
in
the
street
in
pouring
rain
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
reading
in
fleet
street
one
day
gilbert
discovered
suddenly
that
the
lord
mayor
show
was
passing
he
began
to
reflect
on
the
show
so
deeply
that
he
forgot
to
look
at
it
overroads
i
remember
as
a
little
triangular
house
much
too
small
for
the
sort
of
fun
the
chestertons
enjoyed
frances
bought
a
field
opposite
to
it
and
there
built
a
studio
the
night
the
studio
was
opened
father
remembers
a
large
party
at
which
charades
were
acted
he
himself
as
canon
gave
away
the
word
so
that
belfry
was
loudly
shouted
by
the
opposition
group
the
rival
company
acting
torture
got
away
with
it
successfully
especially
complains
our
yorkshire
priest
as
was
pronounced
in
the
best
southern
manner
on
that
night
returning
to
the
house
father
offered
his
arm
to
gilbert
who
refused
it
with
a
finality
foreign
to
our
friendship
father
went
on
ahead
and
gilbert
following
in
the
dark
stumbled
over
a
flowerpot
and
broke
his
arm
perhaps
because
his
size
made
him
aware
of
awkwardness
gilbert
hated
being
helped
father
ignatius
rice
another
close
friend
says
the
only
time
he
ever
saw
gilbert
annoyed
was
when
he
offered
him
an
arm
going
upstairs
gilbert
and
frances
would
both
visit
father
in
his
yorkshire
parish
of
heckmondwike
one
year
they
took
rooms
at
ilkley
and
he
remembers
gilbert
adorning
with
huge
frescoes
the
walls
of
the
attic
and
frances
sitting
in
the
window
singing
o
swallow
swallow
flying
south
while
gilbert
did
a
blazon
of
some
fantastic
coat
of
arms
the
closeness
of
the
intimacy
is
seen
in
a
letter
quoted
by
father
in
which
gilbert
explained
why
frances
and
he
were
unable
to
come
to
heckmondwike
for
a
promised
visit
brown
on
p
july
i
would
not
write
this
to
anyone
else
but
you
combine
so
unusually
in
your
own
single
personality
the
characters
of
priest
human
being
man
of
the
world
man
of
the
other
world
man
of
science
old
friend
new
friend
not
to
mention
irishman
and
picture
dealer
that
i
do
mind
suggesting
the
truth
to
you
frances
has
just
come
out
of
what
looked
bad
enough
to
be
an
illness
and
is
just
going
to
plunge
into
one
of
her
recurrent
problems
of
pain
and
depression
the
two
may
be
just
a
bit
too
much
for
her
and
i
want
to
be
with
her
every
night
for
a
few
days
an
irish
bull
for
you
one
of
the
mysteries
of
marriage
which
must
be
a
sacrament
and
an
extraordinary
one
too
is
that
a
man
evidently
useless
like
me
can
yet
become
at
certain
instants
indispensable
and
the
further
oddity
which
i
invite
you
to
explain
on
mystical
grounds
is
that
he
never
feels
so
small
as
when
he
knows
that
he
is
necessary
but
sometimes
she
would
send
him
off
whether
she
was
well
or
ill
and
on
father
would
rest
the
heavy
responsibility
of
getting
him
on
to
his
next
destination
or
safe
back
home
he
tells
of
one
such
experience
he
was
most
dutiful
and
obedient
to
orders
but
they
had
to
be
written
ones
and
backed
by
the
spoken
word
he
brought
his
oh
with
what
loving
care
to
bradford
on
sunday
for
sheffield
for
monday
but
a
careful
host
found
it
under
the
bed
in
bradford
just
as
his
train
left
for
sheffield
sent
at
once
it
was
to
beaconsfield
where
it
landed
at
on
thursday
just
allowing
him
ten
minutes
to
change
and
entrain
for
london
scene
at
beaconsfield
what
on
earth
have
you
done
with
your
gilbert
i
must
have
left
it
behind
darling
but
i
brought
back
the
ties
did
i
p
another
time
he
came
back
without
his
pyjamas
they
had
been
lost
early
in
the
journey
why
did
you
buy
some
more
his
wife
asked
i
did
know
pyjamas
were
things
you
could
buy
he
said
surprised
probably
if
one
were
gilbert
one
could
father
arriving
at
overroads
without
baggage
found
that
gilbert
pyjamas
went
around
him
exactly
twice
lecturing
engagements
had
of
course
not
come
to
an
end
with
the
move
although
they
had
mercifully
somewhat
lessened
what
increased
with
the
distance
from
london
was
the
problem
never
fully
solved
of
getting
gilbert
to
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
in
clothes
not
too
wildly
wrong
when
he
lectured
in
lancashire
they
stayed
at
crosby
with
francis
blundell
my
and
my
sister
remembers
frances
as
incessantly
looking
through
her
bag
for
letters
and
sending
telegrams
to
confirm
engagements
that
had
come
unstuck
or
to
refuse
others
that
were
in
debate
the
celebrated
and
now
almost
legendary
telegram
from
gilbert
to
frances
told
as
from
a
hundred
different
cities
was
really
sent
am
in
market
harborough
where
ought
i
to
be
desperate
she
wired
home
because
as
she
told
me
later
it
was
easier
to
get
him
home
and
start
him
off
again
that
day
engagement
was
lost
past
recall
charles
rowley
of
the
ancoats
brotherhood
received
a
wire
reply
paid
from
snow
hill
station
birmingham
am
i
coming
to
you
tonight
or
what
reply
not
this
tuesday
but
next
wednesday
so
home
he
came
again
to
overroads
the
chestertons
made
a
host
of
friends
in
beaconsfield
but
the
children
always
held
pride
of
place
the
doctor
little
boy
running
along
the
top
of
the
wall
looked
down
at
gilbert
and
remarked
to
his
delight
i
think
you
an
ogre
but
when
the
nurse
was
heard
threatening
punishment
if
he
did
not
get
down
that
minute
the
child
was
told
by
the
ogre
this
wall
is
meant
for
little
boys
to
run
along
one
child
asked
after
a
party
if
chesterton
had
been
very
clever
said
you
should
see
him
catch
buns
in
his
mouf
what
was
unusual
both
with
gilbert
and
frances
was
the
fact
that
they
never
allowed
their
disappointment
in
the
matter
of
children
to
make
them
sour
or
jealous
of
others
who
had
the
joy
that
they
had
not
all
through
their
lives
they
played
with
other
people
children
they
chose
on
a
train
a
compartment
full
of
children
they
planned
amusements
they
gave
presents
to
the
children
of
their
friends
over
my
son
bed
hangs
a
silver
crucifix
chosen
with
loving
care
by
frances
after
gilbert
had
stood
godfather
to
him
and
he
was
one
of
very
many
gilbert
was
however
a
complete
realist
as
to
the
ways
and
manners
of
the
species
he
so
loved
playing
with
children
he
wrote
at
this
time
is
a
glorious
thing
but
the
journalist
in
question
has
never
understood
why
it
was
considered
a
soothing
or
idyllic
one
it
reminds
him
not
of
watering
little
budding
flowers
but
of
wrestling
for
hours
with
gigantic
angels
and
devils
moral
problems
of
the
most
monstrous
complexity
besiege
him
incessantly
he
has
to
decide
before
the
awful
eyes
of
innocence
whether
when
a
sister
has
knocked
down
a
bricks
in
revenge
for
the
brother
having
taken
two
sweets
out
of
his
turn
it
is
endurable
that
the
brother
should
retaliate
by
scribbling
on
the
sister
and
whether
such
conduct
does
not
justify
the
sister
in
blowing
out
the
brother
unlawfully
lit
match
just
as
he
is
solving
this
problem
upon
principles
of
the
highest
morality
it
occurs
to
him
suddenly
that
he
has
not
written
his
saturday
article
and
that
there
is
only
about
an
hour
to
do
it
in
he
wildly
calls
to
somebody
probably
the
gardener
to
telephone
to
somewhere
for
a
messenger
he
barricades
himself
in
another
room
and
tears
his
hair
wondering
what
on
earth
he
shall
write
about
a
drumming
of
fists
on
the
door
outside
and
a
cheerful
bellowing
encourage
and
clarify
his
thoughts
he
sits
down
desperately
the
messenger
rings
at
the
bell
the
children
drum
on
the
door
the
servants
run
up
from
time
to
time
to
say
the
messenger
is
getting
bored
and
the
pencil
staggers
along
making
the
world
a
present
of
fifteen
hundred
unimportant
words
and
making
shakespeare
a
present
of
a
portion
of
gray
putting
fantastic
roots
wreathed
high
instead
of
antique
roots
peep
out
then
the
journalist
sends
off
his
copy
and
turns
his
attention
to
the
enigma
of
whether
a
brother
should
commandeer
a
sister
necklace
because
the
sister
pinched
him
at
littlehampton
chesterton
had
actually
made
this
slip
and
the
present
quotation
is
from
the
article
he
wrote
in
apology
in
the
notebook
he
had
written
north
berwick
on
the
sands
i
romped
with
children
do
you
blame
me
that
i
did
not
improve
myself
by
bottling
anemones
but
i
say
that
these
children
will
be
men
and
women
and
i
say
that
the
anemones
will
not
be
men
and
women
not
just
yet
at
least
let
us
say
and
i
say
that
the
greatest
men
of
the
world
might
romp
with
children
and
that
i
should
like
to
see
shakespeare
romping
with
children
and
browning
and
darwin
romping
with
children
and
gladstone
romping
with
children
and
professor
huxley
romping
with
children
and
all
the
bishops
romping
with
children
and
i
say
that
if
a
man
had
climbed
to
the
stars
and
found
the
secrets
of
the
angels
the
best
thing
and
the
most
useful
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
come
back
and
romp
with
children
an
almost
elvish
little
girl
with
loose
brown
hair
doing
needlework
i
have
spoken
to
her
once
or
twice
i
think
i
must
get
another
book
of
the
same
size
as
this
to
make
notes
about
her
from
the
christmas
party
at
overroads
all
adults
were
excluded
no
nurses
no
parents
the
children
would
hang
on
gilbert
neck
in
an
ecstasy
of
affection
and
he
and
frances
schemed
out
endless
games
for
them
gilbert
had
started
a
toy
theatre
before
he
left
london
cutting
out
and
painting
figures
and
scenery
and
devising
plots
for
plays
two
of
the
favourites
were
george
and
the
dragon
and
the
seven
champions
of
christendom
the
atmosphere
of
overroads
is
perhaps
best
conveyed
through
gilbert
theories
concerning
his
toy
theatre
and
the
other
theatricals
such
as
charades
sometimes
played
there
when
it
came
to
the
toy
theatre
set
up
to
amuse
the
children
he
frankly
felt
that
he
was
himself
child
no
and
got
the
most
amusement
out
of
it
he
felt
too
that
the
whole
thing
was
good
enough
to
be
worth
analysing
in
its
rules
and
its
effects
and
so
he
drew
up
a
paper
of
rules
and
suggestions
for
its
use
i
will
not
say
positively
that
a
is
the
best
of
theatres
though
i
have
had
more
fun
out
of
it
than
out
of
any
other
but
i
will
say
positively
that
the
is
the
best
of
all
toys
it
sometimes
fails
but
generally
because
people
are
mistaken
in
the
matter
of
what
it
is
meant
to
do
and
what
it
can
or
can
not
be
expected
to
do
as
if
people
should
use
a
toy
balloon
as
a
football
or
a
skipping
rope
as
a
hammock
now
the
first
rule
may
seem
rather
contradictory
but
it
is
quite
true
and
really
quite
simple
in
a
small
theatre
because
it
is
a
small
theatre
you
can
not
deal
with
small
things
because
it
is
a
small
theatre
it
must
only
deal
with
large
things
you
can
introduce
a
dragon
but
you
can
not
really
introduce
an
earwig
it
is
too
small
for
a
small
theatre
and
this
is
true
not
only
of
small
creatures
but
of
small
actions
small
gestures
and
small
details
of
any
kind
all
your
effects
must
be
made
to
depend
on
things
like
scenery
and
background
the
sky
and
the
clouds
and
the
castles
and
the
mountains
and
so
on
must
be
the
exciting
things
along
with
other
things
that
move
all
of
a
piece
such
as
regiments
and
processions
great
and
glorious
things
can
be
done
with
processions
in
a
real
comedy
the
whole
excitement
may
consist
in
the
nervous
curate
dropping
his
though
i
do
not
recommend
this
incident
for
the
drama
of
the
but
if
he
were
nervous
let
us
say
about
a
thunderstorm
the
could
hardly
represent
the
nervousness
but
it
might
manage
the
it
might
be
quite
sensational
and
yet
entirely
simple
for
it
would
largely
consist
of
darkening
the
stage
and
making
horrible
noises
behind
the
scenes
the
second
and
smaller
rule
that
really
follows
from
this
is
that
everything
dramatic
should
depend
not
on
a
character
action
but
simply
on
his
appearance
shakespeare
said
of
actors
that
they
have
their
exits
and
their
entrances
but
these
actors
ought
really
to
have
nothing
else
except
exits
and
entrances
the
trick
is
to
so
arrange
the
tale
that
the
mere
appearance
of
a
person
tells
the
important
truth
about
him
thus
supposing
the
drama
to
be
about
george
let
us
say
the
mere
abrupt
appearance
of
the
dragon
head
if
of
a
proper
ferocity
will
be
enough
to
explain
that
he
intends
to
eat
people
and
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
the
dragon
to
explain
at
length
with
animated
gestures
and
playful
conversation
that
his
nature
is
carnivorous
and
that
he
has
not
merely
dropped
in
to
tea
there
is
some
further
discussion
on
colour
effects
i
like
very
gay
and
glaring
colours
and
i
like
to
give
them
a
good
chance
to
glare
the
paper
concludes
on
a
more
serious
note
it
is
an
old
story
and
for
some
a
sad
one
that
in
a
sense
these
childish
toys
are
more
to
us
than
they
can
ever
be
to
children
we
never
know
how
much
of
our
after
imaginations
began
with
such
a
into
paradise
i
sometimes
think
that
houses
are
interesting
because
they
are
so
like
doll
houses
and
i
am
sure
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
for
many
large
theatres
is
that
they
may
remind
us
of
little
theatres
i
do
not
look
back
i
look
forward
to
this
kind
of
puppet
play
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
i
shall
have
time
to
play
with
it
some
day
when
i
am
too
lazy
to
write
anything
or
even
to
read
anything
i
shall
retire
into
this
box
of
marvels
and
i
shall
be
found
still
striving
hopefully
to
get
inside
a
adults
as
well
as
children
enjoyed
this
toy
and
it
was
often
described
by
interviewers
like
the
the
great
cloak
and
flapping
hat
it
was
felt
by
some
to
be
gilbert
way
of
attracting
attention
but
it
was
just
one
of
gilbert
ways
of
amusing
himself
a
small
nephew
of
frances
was
living
with
them
at
the
time
and
it
was
funny
to
watch
him
fencing
with
his
huge
uncle
who
was
obviously
enjoying
himself
rather
the
more
of
the
two
on
my
first
visit
to
overroads
i
noticed
how
as
we
talked
my
host
pencil
never
ceased
one
evening
i
collected
and
kept
an
imposing
red
indian
and
a
caricature
of
chesterton
himself
in
a
wheelbarrow
being
carried
off
to
the
bonfire
i
came
in
too
for
one
of
the
parties
in
which
guessing
games
were
a
feature
lines
from
the
poets
were
illustrated
and
we
had
to
guess
them
at
another
party
pocock
told
me
did
the
inns
of
beaconsfield
of
which
the
most
successful
drawing
was
that
of
a
sadly
dilapidated
dragon
being
turned
away
from
the
inn
door
dragon
discovers
with
disgust
that
he
can
not
put
up
at
the
george
sometimes
these
drawings
were
the
prize
of
whoever
guessed
the
line
of
verse
they
illustrated
sometimes
they
were
sold
for
a
local
charity
the
babies
convalescent
home
was
a
favourite
object
and
one
admirable
picture
reproduced
in
coloured
shows
the
despair
of
king
herod
at
discovering
children
convalescing
from
the
massacre
the
two
closest
friendships
of
early
beaconsfield
life
were
with
the
rector
comerline
and
his
wife
who
are
now
dead
and
and
pocock
pocock
was
the
chestertons
doctor
as
well
as
their
friend
and
he
tells
me
that
his
great
difficulty
in
treating
gilbert
lay
in
his
detachment
from
his
own
physical
circumstances
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
him
he
usually
notice
it
he
was
the
most
uncomplaining
person
you
had
to
hunt
him
all
over
to
find
out
if
anything
was
wrong
this
detachment
from
circumstances
still
extended
to
his
appearance
and
frances
one
day
begged
pocock
to
take
him
to
a
good
tailor
it
was
a
huge
success
he
had
never
looked
so
well
as
he
did
now
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
the
tailor
said
to
pocock
chesterton
has
broken
my
heart
it
took
twice
the
material
and
twice
the
time
to
make
for
him
but
i
proud
of
it
his
tailor
like
his
doctor
was
apt
to
become
a
friend
pocock
recalls
how
he
would
go
to
a
dinner
of
the
tradesmen
of
beaconsfield
and
come
back
intensely
interested
and
wanting
to
tell
her
all
about
it
you
always
went
away
pocock
said
chuckling
over
something
and
he
summed
up
the
years
of
their
friendship
saying
you
never
saw
him
without
getting
delight
from
his
presence
sometimes
he
would
grow
abstracted
in
the
train
of
his
own
thought
and
father
ignatius
rice
remembers
an
occasion
when
he
was
one
of
a
group
discussing
really
bad
lines
of
poetry
gilbert
broke
into
something
frances
was
saying
with
the
words
that
irritating
person
milton
then
realising
he
had
interrupted
her
he
broke
off
and
apologised
profusely
when
she
had
finished
he
went
on
that
irritating
person
milton
i
ca
find
a
single
bad
line
in
him
frances
one
day
came
in
rather
suddenly
when
pocock
was
there
and
gilbert
exclaimed
oh
you
broken
it
she
looked
round
thinking
she
must
have
knocked
something
over
no
he
said
it
was
an
idea
it
will
come
back
said
frances
no
he
said
it
got
broken
more
usually
he
was
indifferent
to
interruptions
sometimes
he
welcomed
them
as
grist
for
his
mind
mill
daily
life
went
on
around
him
and
often
in
his
articles
one
can
find
traces
of
daily
activities
as
well
as
his
own
attending
him
for
his
broken
arm
pocock
told
him
at
a
certain
stage
to
write
something
anything
to
see
if
he
could
use
a
pen
again
after
an
instant
thought
gilbert
headed
his
paper
with
the
name
of
a
prominent
jew
and
wrote
i
am
fond
of
jews
jews
are
fond
of
money
never
mind
of
whose
i
am
fond
of
jews
oh
but
when
they
lose
damn
it
all
it
funny
the
name
at
the
head
which
wild
horses
would
not
drag
from
me
is
the
key
to
this
impromptu
it
was
really
true
that
gilbert
was
fond
of
very
many
jews
in
his
original
group
of
friends
four
jews
had
been
included
and
with
three
of
these
his
friendship
continued
through
life
lawrence
solomon
and
his
wife
were
among
the
beaconsfield
neighbours
and
he
saw
them
often
there
was
another
kind
of
jew
he
very
heartily
disliked
but
he
was
at
great
pains
to
draw
this
distinction
himself
speaking
at
the
jewish
west
end
literary
society
in
he
put
the
question
of
what
the
real
jewish
problem
was
the
jews
he
said
were
a
race
born
civilised
you
never
met
a
jewish
clod
or
yokel
they
represented
one
of
the
highest
of
civilised
types
but
while
all
other
races
had
local
attachments
the
jews
were
universal
and
scattered
they
could
not
be
expected
to
have
patriotism
for
the
countries
in
which
they
made
their
homes
their
patriotism
could
be
only
for
their
race
in
principle
he
believed
in
the
solution
of
zionism
and
then
the
reporter
in
large
letters
made
a
headline
chesterton
said
that
speaking
generally
as
with
most
other
communities
poor
jews
were
nice
and
the
rich
were
nasty
many
years
later
in
palestine
he
was
to
be
driven
around
the
country
as
he
has
described
in
new
by
one
of
these
less
wealthy
jews
who
had
sacrificed
his
career
in
england
to
his
national
idealism
and
later
yet
after
death
rabbi
wise
a
leader
of
american
jewry
paid
him
tribute
in
a
letter
to
cyril
clements
dated
september
indeed
i
was
a
warm
admirer
of
gilbert
chesterton
apart
from
his
delightful
art
and
his
genius
in
many
directions
he
was
as
you
know
a
great
religionist
he
as
catholic
i
as
jew
could
not
have
seen
eye
to
eye
with
each
other
and
he
might
have
added
particularly
seeing
that
you
are
but
i
deeply
respected
him
when
hitlerism
came
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
speak
out
with
all
the
directness
and
frankness
of
a
great
and
unabashed
spirit
blessing
to
his
memory
chapter
xvi
a
circle
of
friends
in
the
last
chapter
this
chapter
and
to
a
considerable
extent
those
that
follow
down
to
the
break
made
by
gilbert
illness
and
the
war
of
it
is
unavoidable
that
the
same
years
should
be
retraced
to
cover
a
variety
of
aspects
for
their
home
was
for
both
gilbert
and
frances
the
centre
of
a
widening
circle
although
i
visited
overroads
it
seems
to
me
looking
back
i
saw
them
just
then
much
more
frequently
in
london
and
elsewhere
several
times
they
stayed
at
lotus
our
surrey
home
the
first
time
it
was
a
weekend
of
blazing
summer
weather
lady
blennerhassett
was
there
formerly
countess
leyden
and
a
favourite
disciple
of
döllinger
i
remember
she
delighted
gilbert
by
her
comment
on
modernism
i
must
she
said
have
the
same
religion
as
my
washerwoman
and
father
tyrrell
is
not
the
religion
for
my
washerwoman
we
sat
on
the
terrace
in
the
sunshine
and
lady
blennerhassett
asked
suddenly
whether
the
soles
of
our
boots
were
like
hers
without
hole
or
blemish
we
all
looked
very
odd
as
we
stuck
our
feet
out
and
tried
to
see
the
soles
gilbert
offered
a
wicker
chair
preferred
the
grass
because
he
said
there
was
grave
danger
he
might
unduly
modify
the
chair
after
a
meeting
of
the
westminster
dining
society
the
predecessor
of
the
wiseman
he
wrote
my
mother
an
unnecessary
apology
dear
wilfrid
ward
i
have
wanted
for
some
days
past
to
write
to
you
but
could
not
make
up
my
mind
whether
i
was
making
my
position
worse
or
better
but
i
do
want
to
apologise
to
you
for
the
way
in
which
i
threw
out
your
delightful
catholic
dining
society
affair
the
other
day
i
behaved
badly
dined
badly
debated
badly
and
left
badly
yet
the
explanation
is
really
simple
i
was
horribly
worried
and
i
do
not
worry
well
when
i
am
worried
i
am
like
a
baby
my
wife
was
that
night
just
ill
enough
to
make
a
man
nervous
a
stupid
man
and
i
had
sworn
to
her
that
i
would
fulfill
some
affairs
that
night
on
which
she
was
keen
as
she
is
better
now
and
only
wants
rest
i
feel
normal
and
realise
what
a
rotter
i
must
have
looked
that
night
as
belloc
wrote
in
a
beautiful
epitaph
he
frequently
would
flush
with
fear
when
other
people
paled
he
tried
to
do
his
duty
but
how
damnably
he
failed
this
is
the
epitaph
of
yours
sincerely
chesterton
my
father
and
mother
were
hardly
less
excited
than
i
at
the
discovery
of
the
greatest
man
of
the
age
for
so
we
all
felt
him
to
be
gilbert
later
described
my
father
as
strongly
with
mind
and
this
was
perhaps
his
own
chief
characteristic
in
conversation
the
two
men
did
not
agree
on
politics
but
on
religion
their
agreement
was
deep
and
constantly
grew
deeper
as
they
in
exploring
it
our
headquarters
were
in
surrey
but
when
we
came
up
to
london
every
spring
my
parents
wanted
to
bring
the
chestertons
into
touch
with
all
their
friends
they
tended
to
think
of
their
luncheon
table
as
chesterton
supported
by
those
most
worthy
of
the
honour
one
of
the
first
was
of
course
george
wyndham
already
a
friend
and
admirer
of
gilbert
at
this
luncheon
they
discussed
the
modern
press
century
lampoons
the
ingredients
of
a
good
english
style
the
lawfulness
of
revolution
the
causes
of
napoleon
scripture
criticism
joan
of
arc
public
executions
how
to
bring
about
reforms
it
was
absurd
said
to
think
that
gaining
half
a
reform
led
to
the
other
half
supposing
it
was
agreed
that
every
man
ought
to
have
a
cow
but
you
say
we
ca
manage
that
just
yet
give
him
half
a
cow
he
does
care
for
it
and
he
leaves
it
about
and
he
never
asks
for
the
other
half
talking
of
the
eastern
and
western
races
gilbert
said
it
was
curious
that
while
the
easterns
were
so
logical
and
clear
in
their
religion
they
were
so
unpractical
in
life
the
religion
of
the
westerns
is
mystical
and
full
of
paradoxes
yet
they
are
far
more
practical
the
eastern
says
fate
governs
everything
and
he
sits
and
looks
pretty
we
believe
in
and
predestination
and
we
invent
babbage
calculating
machine
as
the
group
grew
into
one
another
thought
the
talk
intensified
and
we
got
from
considering
east
and
west
to
considering
our
own
countrymen
what
makes
a
man
essentially
english
dickens
had
it
johnson
had
it
you
could
said
imagine
a
scotch
johnson
or
an
irish
johnson
or
a
french
or
german
johnson
george
wyndham
told
us
as
we
got
on
to
the
topic
of
patriotism
that
he
had
a
fear
he
hardly
liked
to
utter
as
we
urged
him
he
said
he
feared
a
big
war
might
come
and
we
might
be
defeated
gilbert
agreed
that
he
too
had
felt
that
fear
but
he
said
if
you
were
to
say
that
in
the
house
or
i
to
write
it
in
a
paper
we
should
be
denounced
as
unpatriotic
small
wonder
the
talk
had
time
to
range
for
these
scrappy
notes
are
all
that
remain
of
a
meeting
beginning
about
one
and
lasting
until
five
at
that
hour
two
little
old
sisters
the
miss
blounts
known
in
our
family
as
the
little
b
happened
to
call
on
my
mother
i
shall
never
forget
their
faces
as
they
looked
at
the
huge
man
in
the
armchair
and
the
other
guests
all
absorbed
and
animated
and
realised
that
they
were
interrupting
a
luncheon
party
a
swift
glance
at
the
little
old
ladies
another
at
the
clock
and
the
party
broke
up
to
remain
my
most
cherished
memory
for
months
until
my
next
visit
to
their
home
when
gilbert
and
i
arrived
at
the
use
of
each
other
christian
names
an
agreement
that
he
insisted
on
calling
the
pact
of
beaconsfield
how
deep
he
saw
when
in
his
defence
of
hermits
he
analysed
a
chief
joy
of
human
intercourse
the
best
things
that
happen
to
us
are
those
we
get
out
of
what
has
already
happened
if
men
were
honest
with
themselves
they
would
agree
that
actual
social
engagements
even
with
those
they
love
often
seem
strangely
brief
breathless
thwarted
or
inconclusive
mere
society
is
a
way
of
turning
friends
into
acquaintances
the
real
profit
is
not
in
meeting
our
friends
but
in
having
met
them
now
when
people
merely
plunge
from
crush
to
crush
and
from
crowd
to
crowd
they
never
discover
the
positive
joy
of
life
they
are
like
men
always
hungry
because
their
food
never
digests
also
like
those
men
they
are
cross
well
and
the
pp
there
was
time
in
the
country
for
the
food
of
social
intercourse
to
digest
i
notice
too
that
in
the
list
of
gilbert
friends
men
stood
high
max
beerbohm
jack
phillimore
monsignor
monsignor
knox
his
own
father
maurice
baring
all
these
represent
a
certain
spaciousness
and
leisureliness
which
was
what
he
asked
of
friendship
even
if
they
were
in
a
hurry
they
never
seemed
so
jack
phillimore
both
he
and
we
saw
on
and
off
at
this
time
but
had
often
to
enjoy
in
anticipation
or
in
retrospect
professor
at
one
time
of
greek
at
another
of
latin
at
glasgow
university
he
was
the
kind
of
man
gilbert
specially
appreciated
he
wrote
of
phillimore
after
his
death
something
curiously
like
what
he
wrote
of
his
own
father
he
was
a
supreme
example
of
unadvertised
greatness
and
the
thing
which
is
larger
inside
than
outside
at
oxford
phillimore
had
been
known
as
one
of
belloc
lambs
he
was
very
much
one
of
the
group
who
were
to
run
the
and
but
though
he
always
adored
belloc
no
one
who
knew
him
in
the
fulness
of
his
powers
could
think
of
him
as
anyone
lamb
he
was
a
quiet
humorous
deeply
intelligent
man
a
scholar
of
european
repute
whose
knowledge
of
mediaeval
latin
verse
equalled
his
classical
scholarship
gilbert
keen
observation
of
his
friends
is
never
shown
better
than
in
what
he
wrote
of
phillimore
like
a
needle
pricking
a
drum
his
quietude
seemed
to
kill
all
the
noise
of
our
loud
plutocracy
and
publicity
in
all
this
he
was
supremely
the
scholar
with
not
a
little
of
the
satirist
and
yet
there
was
never
any
man
alive
who
was
so
unlike
a
don
his
religion
purged
him
of
intellectual
pride
and
certainly
of
that
intellectual
vanity
which
so
often
makes
a
sort
of
seething
fuss
underneath
the
acid
sociability
of
academic
centres
he
had
none
of
the
tired
omniscience
which
comes
of
intellectual
breeding
in
and
in
he
seemed
to
be
not
so
much
a
professor
as
a
practiser
of
learning
he
practised
it
quietly
but
heartily
and
humorously
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
any
other
business
if
he
had
been
a
sailor
like
his
father
the
admiral
he
would
have
minded
his
own
business
with
exactly
the
same
smile
and
imperceptible
gesture
indeed
he
looked
much
more
like
a
sailor
than
a
professor
his
dark
square
face
and
clear
eyes
and
compact
figure
were
of
a
type
often
seen
among
sailors
and
in
whatever
academic
enclave
he
stood
he
always
seemed
to
have
walked
in
from
outside
bringing
with
him
some
of
the
winds
of
the
world
and
some
light
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
return
to
my
own
notes
it
is
horribly
characteristic
that
i
wrote
them
in
an
undated
notebook
but
i
think
that
luncheon
which
lasted
so
long
must
have
been
in
the
same
year
my
father
persuaded
both
the
synthetic
society
to
elect
chesterton
and
chesterton
to
attend
the
synthetic
of
his
first
meeting
my
father
wrote
to
george
wyndham
had
you
been
at
the
synthetic
last
night
you
would
have
witnessed
a
memorable
scene
place
westminster
palace
hotel
time
j
b
arthur
balfour
leader
of
the
conservative
party
is
speaking
persuasively
and
in
carefully
modulated
tones
to
an
attentive
audience
suddenly
a
crash
as
though
the
door
were
blown
open
j
brought
to
a
halt
the
whole
company
look
round
and
in
rushes
a
figure
exactly
like
the
pictures
of
wind
when
he
blows
open
the
door
and
forces
an
entrance
in
the
german
child
story
wind
and
madame
rain
a
figure
enormous
and
distended
a
kind
of
walking
mountain
but
with
large
rounded
corners
it
was
who
enveloped
in
a
huge
inverness
cape
of
light
colour
thus
made
his
debut
at
the
synthetic
he
rushed
not
walked
to
a
chair
and
was
dragged
chair
and
all
by
waggett
and
me
as
near
as
might
be
to
the
table
where
with
a
fresh
crash
he
deposited
his
stick
and
then
his
hat
and
there
he
sat
eager
and
attentive
forgetting
all
about
his
stick
and
hat
and
coat
filling
up
the
whole
space
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
drawing
caricatures
of
the
company
on
a
sheet
of
foolscap
a
memorable
figure
very
welcome
to
me
but
arousing
the
fury
of
the
conventional
and
the
dreary
and
well
represented
by
bailey
saunders
who
has
been
at
me
here
half
the
morning
trying
to
convince
me
that
he
will
ruin
the
society
and
ought
never
to
have
been
elected
some
of
the
reactions
of
this
new
recruit
have
been
touched
on
in
his
there
i
met
old
haldane
yawning
with
all
his
hegelian
abysses
who
appeared
to
me
as
i
must
have
appeared
to
a
neighbour
in
a
local
debating
club
when
he
dismissed
metaphysical
depths
and
pointed
at
me
saying
there
is
that
leviathan
whom
thou
hast
made
to
take
his
sport
therein
there
also
i
met
balfour
obviously
preferring
any
philosophers
with
any
philosophies
to
his
loyal
followers
of
the
tory
party
perhaps
religion
is
not
the
opium
of
the
people
but
philosophy
is
the
opium
of
the
politicians
my
father
belonged
to
another
group
besides
the
synthetic
society
for
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
gilbert
was
even
more
ideally
fitted
club
was
founded
by
johnson
the
home
of
the
best
talk
in
the
land
where
garrick
and
goldsmith
were
at
times
shouted
down
by
the
great
lexicographer
a
sign
said
chesterton
of
his
modesty
and
his
essential
democracy
johnson
was
too
democratic
to
reign
as
king
of
his
company
he
preferred
to
contend
with
them
as
an
equal
the
old
formula
still
in
use
had
informed
my
father
you
have
had
the
honour
to
be
elected
but
wilfrid
ward
felt
that
the
election
of
the
modern
johnson
would
be
an
honour
to
the
club
to
his
intense
disgust
he
found
that
only
george
wyndham
could
be
relied
upon
for
support
what
may
be
called
the
social
element
in
the
club
had
become
too
strong
to
welcome
a
man
who
boasted
in
all
directions
of
belonging
to
the
middle
classes
and
whose
friends
merely
urged
the
claim
that
he
was
one
of
the
few
today
who
could
talk
as
well
as
johnson
gilbert
met
many
politicians
in
other
ways
but
only
with
one
of
them
did
he
feel
a
really
close
harmony
of
george
wyndham
opinions
he
said
in
the
that
they
were
of
the
same
general
colour
as
my
own
and
he
went
on
to
stress
the
word
colour
as
significant
of
the
whole
man
to
depict
him
in
political
cartoons
as
george
had
not
in
it
the
sort
of
absurdity
of
the
pictures
of
the
more
frigid
and
philosophic
balfour
as
prince
arthur
george
really
did
suggest
the
ages
of
chivalry
he
had
huge
sympathy
with
gypsies
and
tramps
there
was
about
him
an
inward
generosity
that
gave
a
gusto
or
relish
to
all
he
did
the
chestertons
appreciation
of
george
wyndham
was
deepened
for
them
both
by
an
affection
indeed
almost
a
reverence
for
the
deep
mysticism
of
his
wife
a
woman
not
to
be
forgotten
by
anyone
who
ever
knew
her
and
still
less
to
be
merely
praised
by
anyone
who
adequately
appreciated
her
for
a
period
at
any
rate
gilbert
and
frances
were
much
in
contact
with
the
extreme
group
in
the
church
of
england
in
the
best
of
that
group
and
many
of
them
are
very
very
good
there
is
a
sense
of
taking
part
in
a
crusade
to
restore
catholicism
to
the
whole
country
canon
scott
holland
led
a
campaign
for
social
justice
and
many
of
the
same
group
mixed
this
with
devotion
to
our
lady
belief
in
the
real
presence
and
a
profound
love
of
the
catholic
past
of
england
george
wyndham
wife
lady
grosvenor
was
one
of
this
group
and
also
her
friend
father
philip
waggett
of
the
cowley
fathers
father
waggett
a
member
of
the
synthetic
society
and
intimate
with
my
parents
became
also
intimate
with
the
chestertons
ralph
adams
cram
described
his
own
meeting
with
chesterton
arranged
by
father
waggett
father
waggett
asked
my
wife
and
myself
once
when
we
were
staying
in
london
whom
we
would
like
best
to
meet
anyone
from
the
king
downward
we
chose
chesterton
who
was
a
very
particular
friend
of
father
waggett
at
that
time
we
put
on
a
dinner
at
the
buckingham
palace
hotel
in
those
days
the
haunt
of
all
the
county
families
and
in
defiance
of
fate
had
this
dinner
in
the
public
dining
room
we
had
as
guests
father
waggett
and
chesterton
the
entrance
into
the
dining
room
of
the
short
processional
created
something
of
a
sensation
amongst
the
aforesaid
county
families
there
assembled
father
waggett
thin
cropheaded
monk
in
cassock
and
rope
vast
and
practically
globular
little
chesterton
very
south
kensington
in
moss
green
velvet
my
wife
and
myself
the
dinner
was
a
riot
i
have
the
clearest
recollection
of
seated
ponderously
at
the
table
drinking
champagne
by
magnums
continually
feeding
his
face
with
food
which
as
he
was
constantly
employed
in
the
most
dazzling
and
epigrammatic
conversation
was
apt
to
fall
from
his
fork
and
rebound
from
his
corporosity
until
the
fragments
disappeared
under
the
table
he
and
father
waggett
egged
each
other
on
to
the
most
preposterous
amusements
each
would
write
a
triolet
for
the
other
to
illustrate
they
were
both
as
clever
with
the
pencil
as
with
the
pen
and
they
covered
the
backs
of
menus
with
most
astonishing
literary
and
artistic
productions
i
particularly
remember
suddenly
looking
out
of
the
dining
room
window
towards
buckingham
palace
and
announcing
that
he
was
now
prepared
to
write
a
disloyal
triolet
this
was
during
the
reign
of
king
edward
vii
and
the
result
was
convincing
i
have
somewhere
the
whole
collection
of
these
literary
productions
with
their
illustrations
but
where
they
are
i
do
not
know
by
cyril
clemens
pp
on
a
second
visit
of
the
chestertons
to
lotus
george
wyndham
was
there
he
had
told
us
of
his
habit
of
shouting
the
ballad
of
the
white
horse
to
submissive
listeners
and
we
had
hoped
for
the
same
treat
but
gilbert
got
the
book
and
kicked
it
under
his
chair
defying
us
to
recover
it
we
had
at
that
time
a
vast
german
cook
of
a
girth
almost
equal
to
his
own
and
possessed
of
unbounded
curiosity
in
the
matter
of
our
guests
gilbert
declared
that
as
he
sat
peacefully
in
the
drawing
room
she
approached
him
holding
out
a
paper
which
he
supposed
to
be
a
laundry
list
and
then
started
back
exclaiming
that
she
had
thought
him
to
be
ward
it
was
on
this
visit
that
he
remarked
to
a
lady
who
happened
to
be
the
granddaughter
of
a
duke
you
and
i
who
belong
to
the
jolly
old
upper
middle
classes
had
he
been
told
about
her
ancestry
he
would
i
imagine
have
felt
that
he
had
paid
her
an
implied
compliment
by
not
being
aware
of
it
for
into
the
world
of
the
aristocracy
he
and
frances
had
been
received
in
london
and
he
viewed
it
with
the
same
calm
humour
and
potential
friendliness
as
he
had
for
all
the
rest
of
mankind
when
frances
in
her
diary
pitied
the
duchess
of
sutherland
and
felt
that
a
single
day
of
such
a
life
as
the
duchess
lived
would
drive
her
crazy
she
was
expressing
gilbert
taste
as
well
as
her
own
for
a
certain
simplicity
of
life
social
position
neither
excited
nor
irritated
him
he
liked
or
disliked
an
aristocrat
exactly
as
he
liked
or
disliked
a
postman
gilbert
and
cecil
chesterton
really
were
as
conrad
noel
said
personally
unconcerned
about
class
they
had
however
a
principle
against
the
position
of
the
english
aristocracy
which
will
be
better
understood
in
the
light
of
their
general
social
and
historical
outlook
what
might
be
called
the
social
side
of
it
was
often
expressed
by
when
lecturing
on
dickens
thus
speaking
at
manchester
for
the
dickens
centenary
he
was
reported
as
saying
the
objection
to
aristocracy
was
quite
simple
it
was
not
that
aristocrats
were
all
blackguards
it
was
that
in
an
aristocratic
state
people
sat
in
a
huge
darkened
theatre
and
only
the
stage
was
lighted
they
saw
five
or
six
people
walking
about
and
they
said
that
man
looks
very
heroic
striding
about
with
a
sword
plenty
of
people
outside
in
the
street
looked
more
heroic
striding
about
with
an
umbrella
but
they
did
not
see
these
things
all
the
lights
being
turned
out
that
was
the
really
philosophic
objection
to
an
aristocratic
society
it
was
not
that
the
lord
was
a
fool
he
was
about
as
clever
as
one
own
brother
or
cousin
it
was
because
attention
was
confined
to
a
few
people
that
one
judged
them
as
one
judged
actors
on
the
stage
forgetting
everybody
else
chesterton
thought
everybody
should
be
remembered
whether
suburban
proletarian
aristocrat
or
pauper
shortly
after
the
removal
to
beaconsfield
he
was
summoned
to
give
evidence
before
a
parliamentary
commission
on
the
question
of
censorship
of
the
theatre
keep
it
he
said
to
the
surprise
of
many
of
his
friends
but
change
the
manner
of
its
exercise
let
it
be
no
longer
censorship
by
an
expert
but
by
a
jury
by
twelve
ordinary
men
these
will
be
the
best
judges
of
what
really
makes
for
morality
and
sound
sense
he
had
come
to
give
evidence
he
said
not
as
a
writer
but
as
the
representative
of
the
gallery
and
he
was
concerned
only
with
the
good
and
happiness
of
the
english
people
one
bewildered
commissioner
was
understood
to
murmur
that
their
terms
of
reference
were
not
quite
so
wide
as
that
the
chapter
in
the
called
friendships
and
foolery
ends
suddenly
with
a
reference
to
the
war
but
like
the
whole
book
it
leaps
wildly
about
one
point
in
it
is
interesting
and
links
up
with
the
introduction
to
titterton
that
gilbert
later
wrote
to
shout
a
chorus
is
natural
to
mankind
and
claims
that
he
had
done
it
long
before
he
heard
of
community
singing
he
sang
when
out
driving
or
walking
over
the
moors
with
father
he
sang
in
fleet
street
with
titterton
and
his
journalist
friends
he
sang
the
on
trade
union
platforms
and
in
revolutionary
groups
there
was
he
claims
a
legend
that
in
auberon
herbert
rooms
not
far
from
buckingham
palace
we
sang
drake
drum
with
such
passionate
patriotism
that
king
edward
the
seventh
sent
in
a
request
for
the
noise
to
stop
yet
it
was
all
but
impossible
to
teach
gilbert
a
tune
and
bernard
shaw
felt
this
as
we
have
seen
a
real
drawback
to
his
understanding
of
his
own
life
and
career
music
was
to
shaw
what
line
and
color
were
to
chesterton
but
to
chesterton
singing
was
just
making
a
noise
to
show
he
felt
happy
once
he
wrote
a
poem
called
music
but
only
as
one
more
flower
in
the
wreath
he
was
always
weaving
for
frances
who
was
says
monsignor
knox
the
heroine
of
all
his
novels
june
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbal
he
that
made
me
sealed
my
ears
and
the
pomp
of
gorgeous
noises
waves
of
triumph
waves
of
tears
thundered
empty
round
and
past
me
shattered
lost
for
evermore
ancient
gold
of
pride
and
passion
wrecked
like
treasure
on
a
shore
but
i
saw
her
cheek
and
forehead
change
as
at
a
spoken
word
and
i
saw
her
head
uplifted
like
a
lily
to
the
lord
nought
is
lost
but
all
transmuted
ears
are
sealed
yet
eyes
have
seen
saw
her
smiles
soul
be
worthy
saw
her
tears
heart
be
clean
p
against
the
background
of
all
these
activities
the
books
went
on
pouring
out
as
fast
from
overroads
as
they
had
from
overstrand
a
town
full
of
friends
forty
minutes
journey
from
london
was
not
exactly
the
desert
into
which
admirers
had
advised
gilbert
to
flee
but
he
would
never
have
been
happy
in
a
desert
he
needed
human
company
he
also
needed
to
produce
artistic
paternity
he
once
said
is
as
wholesome
as
physical
paternity
and
certainly
he
never
ceased
to
bring
forth
the
children
of
his
mind
within
two
years
of
the
move
seven
books
were
published

other

at

later
date
the

a
brilliant
short
study
of
art
and
mysticism
after
reading
it
you
feel
you
understand
blake
in
quite
a
new
way
and
then
you
wonder
is
this
illumination
light
on
blake
or
simply
light
on
chesterton
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
writer
was
himself
a
spoilt
artist
which
means
a
man
with
almost
enough
art
in
him
to
have
been
in
the
ranks
of
men
consecrated
for
life
to
art
service
father
brown
had
first
made
his
appearance
in
magazines
and
these
detective
stories
became
the
most
purely
popular
of
gilbert
books
it
was
a
new
genre
detection
in
which
the
mind
of
a
man
means
more
than
his
footprints
or
cigar
ash
even
to
the
detective
the
one
reproduced
in
most
anthologies
the
invisible
man
depends
for
its
solution
on
the
fact
that
certain
people

invisible

the
question
has
anyone
been
here
the
answer
no

not
include
the
milkman
or
the
postman
thus
the
postman
is
the
morally
invisible
man
who
has
committed
the
crime
a
thread
of
this
sort
runs
through
all
the
stories
but
they
are
like
all
his
romances
full
too
of
escape
and
peril
and
wild
adventure
life
on
several
occasions
imitated
gilbert
fancies
thus
the
azeff
revelations
followed
his
fantastic
idea
in
man
who
was
of
the
anarchists
who
turn
out
to
be
detectives
in
disguise
the
technique
of
father
brown
himself
was
imitated
by
a
man
in
detroit
who
recovered
a
stolen
car
by
putting
himself
imaginatively
in
the
thief
place
and
driving
an
exactly
similar
car
around
likely
corners
till
he
came
suddenly
upon
his
own
left
in
a
lonely
road
he
wrote

tell
gilbert
of
this
adventure

chicago

an
even
odder

it

extremely
difficult

all

march
two
months
after
this
an
interviewer
from
the
visited
beaconsfield
and
splashed
headlines
in
the
paper
to
the
effect
that
the
spirit
of
chesterton
was
inspiring
a
fight
between
the
leaseholders
in
edwardes
square
and
a
firm
which
had
bought
up
their
garden
to
erect
a
barricades
were
erected
by
day
and
destroyed
in
the
night
a
beadle
held
the
fort
with
a
garden
roller
and
said
the
creatures
of
my
napoleon
of
notting
hill
have
entered
into
the
bodies
of
the
staid
burghers
of
kensington
in
none
of
these
cases
was
there
any
likelihood
as
the
noted
of
the
actors
in
life
having
read
the
books
they
were
spiritedly
staging
ideas
have
a
life
of
their
own
the
interviewer
tentatively
ventured
but
he
may
have
been
puzzled
as
agreed
heartily
in
the
words
i
am
no
dirty
nominalist
chesterton
kept
the
reviewers
busy
as
well
as
the
interviewers
and
in
all
his
stories
they
noted
one
curiosity
if
time
and
space
or
any
circumstances
interfere
with
the
cutting
of
his
gordian
knots
he
commands
time
and
space
to
make
themselves
scarce
and
circumstances
to
be
no
more
heard
of
about
time
and
space
this
is
true
in
a
unique
degree
for
him
time
seems
to
have
had
no
existence
or
perhaps
rather
to
have
been
like
a
telescope
elongating
and
shortening
at
will
as
a
young
man
it
may
be
remembered
he
gave
in
the
course
of
one
letter
two
quite
irreconcilable
statements
of
the
length
of
time
since
events
in
his
school
days
he
had
indeed
the
same
difficulty
about
time
as
about
money
he
mentions
in
the
that
after
his
watch
was
stolen
during
a
demonstration
he
never
bothered
to
possess
another
in
his
stories
this
oddity
became
more
marked
in
ball
and
the
he
relates
adventures
performed
in
leaping
on
and
off
an
omnibus
in
such
fashion
that
the
bus
must
have
covered
several
miles
of
ground
and
then
we
are
suddenly
told
it
had
gone
the
few
score
yards
from
the
bottom
of
ludgate
hill
to
the
top
still
stranger
are
the
records
in
man
who
was
and
of
the
happenings
of
a
single
day
while
in
return
of
don
a
new
organisation
of
society
is
described
as
though
many
years
old
and
then
suddenly
announced
as
having
been
on
foot
some
weeks
but
to
return
for
one
moment
to
the
more
serious
aspects
of
the
work
of
these
years
while
wrong
with
the
discussed
in
some
detail
in
the
next
chapter
is
the
first
sketch
of
his
social
views
a
kind
of
blueprint
for
a
sane
and
human
sort
of
world
the
other
books
with
all
their
foolery
hold
a
serious
purpose
they
should
be
read
as
illustrations
of
the
philosophy
of
both
the
book
he
had
written
and
the
thing
of
which
he
had
said
god
and
humanity
made
it
and
it
made
me
this
row
of
shapeless
and
ungainly
monsters
which
i
now
set
before
the
reader
he
says
of
his
essays
in
the
introduction
on
gargoyles
in
and
does
not
consist
of
separate
idols
cut
out
capriciously
in
lonely
valleys
or
various
islands
these
monsters
are
meant
for
the
gargoyles
of
a
definite
cathedral
i
have
to
carve
the
gargoyles
because
i
can
carve
nothing
else
i
leave
to
others
the
angels
and
the
arches
and
the
spires
but
i
am
very
sure
of
the
style
of
the
architecture
and
of
the
consecration
of
the
church
the
story
of
ball
and
the
already
indicated
to
the
reader
by
the
duel
which
seemed
like
a
parody
of
it
has
the
double
interest
of
its
bearing
on
the
world
of
day
and
its
glimpses
at
a
stranger
world
to
come
a
young
highlander
coming
to
london
sees
in
an
atheist
bookshop
an
insult
to
our
lady
he
smashes
the
window
and
challenges
the
owner
to
a
duel
turnbull
the
atheist
is
more
than
ready
to
fight
but
the
world
caring
nothing
for
religious
opinions
regards
anyone
ready
to
fight
for
them
as
a
madman
and
is
mainly
concerned
with
keeping
the
peace
pursued
by
all
the
resources
of
modern
civilisation
the
two
men
spend
the
rest
of
the
book
starting
to
fight
being
interrupted
and
arrested
by
the
police
escaping
arguing
and
fighting
again
they
end
up
in
an
asylum
with
a
garden
where
again
they
talk
endlessly
and
where
the
power
of
lucifer
the
prince
of
this
world
has
enclosed
everyone
who
has
been
concerned
in
their
wild
flight
so
that
no
memory
of
it
may
live
on
the
earth
the
two
sides
of
chesterton
brain
are
engaged
in
the
duel
of
minds
in
this
book
and
some
of
his
best
writing
is
in
it
both
in
the
description
of
the
wild
rush
across
sea
and
land
and
in
the
discussions
between
the
two
men
affection
for
the
sincere
atheist
is
noteworthy
and
his
hatred
is
reserved
for
the
shuffler
and
the
compromiser
it
was
grand
to
have
such
a
man
as
turnbull
to
convert
one
of
those
men
in
whom
a
continuous
appetite
and
industry
of
the
intellect
leave
the
emotions
very
simple
and
steady
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
but
he
was
quite
content
to
leave
it
there
his
head
was
his
hobby
this
might
be
chesterton
himself
in
fact
it
is
chesterton
himself
and
the
climax
belongs
to
a
later
world
than
that
of
for
pointing
to
the
ball
bereft
of
the
cross
the
highlander
calls
out
it
staggers
turnbull
it
can
not
stand
by
itself
you
know
it
can
not
it
has
been
the
sorrow
of
your
life
turnbull
this
garden
is
not
a
dream
but
an
apocalyptic
fulfillment
this
garden
is
the
world
gone
mad
about
the
time
this
book
appeared
gilbert
was
asked
by
an
anglican
society
to
lecture
at
coventry
he
said
what
shall
i
lecture
on
they
answered
anything
from
an
elephant
to
an
umbrella
very
well
he
said
i
will
lecture
on
an
umbrella
he
treated
the
umbrella
as
a
symbol
of
increasing
artificiality
we
wear
hair
to
protect
the
head
a
hat
to
protect
the
hair
an
umbrella
to
protect
the
hat
gilbert
said
once
he
was
willing
to
start
anywhere
and
develop
from
anything
the
whole
of
his
philosophy
in
the
notebook
he
had
written
bootlaces
once
i
looked
down
at
my
bootlaces
who
gave
me
my
bootlaces
the
bootmaker
bah
who
gave
the
bootmaker
himself
what
did
i
ever
do
that
i
should
be
given
bootlaces
after
the
lecture
on
the
umbrella
two
priests
saw
him
at
the
railway
bookstall
and
asked
him
if
the
rumour
was
true
that
he
was
thinking
of
joining
the
church
he
answered
it
a
matter
that
is
giving
me
a
great
deal
of
agony
of
mind
and
i
be
very
grateful
if
you
would
pray
for
me
the
following
year
he
broached
the
subject
to
father
when
they
were
alone
in
a
railway
carriage
he
said
he
had
made
up
his
mind
but
he
wanted
to
wait
for
frances
as
she
had
led
him
into
the
anglican
church
out
of
unitarianism
frances
told
father
when
he
came
to
overroads
later
at
the
beginning
of
illness
that
she
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
some
of
her
husband
remarks
especially
one
about
being
buried
at
kendal
green
when
father
told
her
what
had
been
on
gilbert
mind
she
was
half
amused
at
the
hints
he
had
been
dropping
she
recognised
his
reluctance
to
move
without
her
but
i
think
she
probably
realised
too
that
even
to
himself
his
conviction
seemed
in
those
years
at
times
more
absolute
at
times
less
we
shall
see
in
a
later
chapter
his
own
analysis
of
his
very
slow
progress
meanwhile
in
his
books
he
was
at
once
deepening
and
widening
his
vision
of
the
faith
fragments
of
verse
used
in
ballad
of
the
white
had
come
to
gilbert
in
his
sleep
a
great
white
horse
had
been
the
romance
of
his
childhood
the
beginning
of
his
honeymoon
under
the
sign
of
the
white
horse
at
ipswich
had
been
a
trip
to
fairyland
but
it
is
hard
to
say
when
the
motif
of
the
white
horse
the
verses
ringing
in
his
head
and
the
ideas
that
make
the
poem
came
together
into
what
many
think
the
greatest
work
of
his
life
in
brown
on
we
are
told
of
the
long
time
the
poem
took
in
the
making
they
talked
of
it
on
the
yorkshire
moors
in
and
father
noted
how
frances
cherished
it
i
could
see
she
was
more
in
love
with
it
than
with
anything
else
he
had
in
hand
father
also
gives
some
interesting
illustrations
of
the
way
talk
ministers
to
a
work
of
genius
he
had
begun
one
day
by
saying
lightly
that
none
of
us
could
become
great
men
without
leaning
on
the
little
ones
could
not
well
begin
our
day
but
for
those
who
started
theirs
first
for
our
sake
lighting
the
fire
and
cooking
the
breakfast
this
was
said
just
before
the
dressing
bell
rang
and
between
the
bell
and
dinner
gilbert
had
written
about
nine
verses
beginning
with
king
alfred
meditation
and
well
may
god
with
the
serving
folk
cast
in
his
dreadful
lot
is
not
he
too
a
servant
and
is
not
he
forgot
in
gilbert
published
in
the
a
fragment
from
a
ballad
epic
of
alfred
which
evoked
the
comment
chesterton
certainly
has
in
each
eye
a
special
röntgen
ray
attachment
he
wrote
white
guided
by
his
favourite
theory
that
to
realise
history
we
should
not
delve
into
the
details
of
research
but
try
only
to
see
the
big
things
for
it
is
those
that
we
generally
overlook
people
talk
about
features
of
interest
but
the
features
never
make
up
a
face
they
will
toil
wearily
off
to
the
tiniest
inscription
or
darkest
picture
that
is
mentioned
in
a
guide
book
as
having
some
reference
to
alfred
the
great
or
william
the
conqueror
but
they
care
nothing
for
the
sky
that
alfred
saw
or
the
hills
on
which
william
hunted
in
the
king
alfred
country
especially
can
be
found
the
titanic
figure
of
the
giant
albion
whom
blake
saw
in
visions
spreading
to
our
encircling
seas
apr
gilbert
wrote
a
sketch
for
the
about
this
time
telling
how
an
old
woman
in
a
donkey
cart
whom
they
had
left
far
behind
on
the
road
went
driving
triumphantly
past
when
the
car
they
were
in
broke
down
for
this
expedition
as
so
often
later
he
made
full
use
of
the
modern
invention
he
derided
in
an
open
touring
car
hired
for
the
occasion
gilbert
in
inverness
cape
and
shapeless
hat
frances
beside
him
snugly
wrapped
up
they
saw
the
hamlets
quaint
with
westland
king
and
westland
saint
and
watched
the
western
glory
faint
along
the
road
to
frome
the
note
struck
in
the
dedication
and
recurring
throughout
the
poem
is
that
of
the
christian
idea
which
had
made
england
great
and
which
he
had
learnt
from
frances
wherefore
i
bring
these
rhymes
to
you
who
brought
the
cross
to
me
since
on
you
flaming
without
flaw
i
saw
the
sign
that
guthrum
saw
when
he
let
break
his
ships
of
awe
and
laid
peace
on
the
sea
in
the
poem
christian
men
whether
they
be
saxon
or
roman
or
briton
or
celt
are
banded
together
to
fight
the
heathen
danes
in
defence
of
the
sacred
things
of
faith
in
defence
of
the
human
things
of
daily
life
in
defence
even
of
the
old
traditions
of
pagan
england
because
it
is
only
christian
men
guard
even
heathen
things
gilbert
constantly
disclaimed
the
idea
that
he
took
trouble
over
anything
taking
trouble
has
never
been
a
weakness
of
mine
but
in
what
might
be
termed
a
large
and
loose
way
he
really
did
take
immense
trouble
over
what
interested
him
king
alfred
is
not
an
almost
mythical
figure
like
king
arthur
and
an
outline
of
his
story
with
legendary
fringes
can
be
traced
in
the
wessex
country
and
confirmed
by
literature
gilbert
wanted
this
general
story
he
did
not
want
antiquarian
exactness
of
detail
into
the
mouths
of
guthrum
and
of
king
alfred
he
put
the
expression
of
the
pagan
and
the
christian
outlook
nor
did
he
hesitate
to
let
king
alfred
prophesy
at
large
concerning
the
days
of
chesterton
the
poem
is
a
ballad
in
the
sense
of
the
old
ballads
that
were
stirring
stories
it
is
also
an
expression
of
the
threefold
love
of
gilbert
life
his
wife
his
country
and
his
faith
and
as
in
all
great
poetry
there
is
a
quality
of
eternity
in
this
poem
that
has
made
it
serve
as
an
expression
of
the
eternal
spirit
of
man
during
the
first
world
war
many
soldiers
had
it
with
them
in
the
trenches
i
want
to
tell
you
the
widow
of
a
sailor
wrote
that
a
copy
of
the
ballad
of
the
white
horse
went
down
into
the
humber
with
the
my
husband
loved
it
as
his
own
soul
never
went
anywhere
without
it
almost
thirty
years
have
passed
and
today
the
poem
still
speaks
greeting
jacques
maritain
on
the
occasion
of
his
sixtieth
birthday
dorothy
thompson
quoted
king
alfred
assertion
of
christian
freedom

conquerors

his
day
after
crete

the
shortest

its

heading
was
a
brief
statement
of
the
disaster
followed
by
the
words
of
our
lady
to
king
alfred
i
tell
you
naught
for
your
comfort
yea
naught
for
your

the
unbreakable
strength
of
that
apparently
faint
and
tenuous
thread
of
faith

in
the
sequel

had
the
ballad
in

dark
days

chapter
xvii
the
disillusioned
liberal
english
were
not
wrong
in
loving
liberty
they
were
only
wrong
in
losing
june
one
main
difficulty
in
writing
biography
lies
in
the
various
strands
that
run
through
every
human
life
it
is
as
i
have
already
said
impossible
to
keep
a
perfect
chronological
order
with
anyone
whose
occupations
and
interests
were
so
multifarious
in
the
present
chapter
and
the
two
that
follow
we
shall
consider
the
movement
of
chesterton
mind
upon
politics
and
sociology
this
will
involve
going
back
to
the
general
election
of
and
forward
to
the
marconi
trial
of
for
those
who
are
interested
in
his
poetry
or
his
humour
or
his
philosophy
or
his
theology
but
not
at
all
in
his
sociological
and
political
outlook
i
fear
that
these
three
chapters
may
loom
a
little
uninvitingly
if
they
are
tempted
to
skip
them
altogether
i
shall
not
blame
them
yet
they
will
miss
a
great
deal
that
is
vital
to
the
understanding
of
his
whole
mind
and
the
course
his
life
was
to
take
these
are
not
the
most
entertaining
chapters
in
the
book
but
if
we
are
really
to
know
chesterton
the
events
they
cover
must
be
considered
most
carefully
as
a
boy
gilbert
chesterton
spoke
of
politics
as
absorbing
for
every
ardent
intellect
and
during
these
years
he
was
himself
deeply
concerned
with
the
politics
of
england
the
ideal
liberalism
sketched
in
his
letter
to
hammond
during
the
boer
war
chapter
x
had
appeared
to
him
if
not
perfectly
realised
at
least
capable
of
realisation
in
the
existing
liberal
party
the
tory
party
was
in
power
and
all
its
acts
to
say
nothing
of
its
general
ineptitude
appeared
to
liberals
as
positive
arguments
for
their
own
party
at
this
date
so
convinced
a
tory
as
lord
hugh
cecil
could
describe
his
own
party
as
to
mix
metaphors
an
eviscerated
ruin
several
letters
and
postcards
from
belloc
announcing
his
own
election
as
liberal
member
for
south
salford
show
the
high
hope
with
which
young
liberalism
was
viewing
the
world
in
in
a
letter
to
wilfrid

meet
that
train
stamps
are
now
in
from
when
the
general
election
left
the
conservatives
still
in
power
until
the
liberal
party
had
been
as
chesterton
described
it
in
the
desert
and
the
younger
members
of
the
party
were
deeply
concerned
with
hammering
out
a
positive
philosophy
which
might
inspire
a
true
programme
for
their
own
party
a
group
of
them
wrote
a
book
called
a
with
the
of
a
patriot
the
patriot
club
had
no
real
existence
but
i
imagine
that
lucian
oldershaw
who
edited
the
book
believed
that
its
publication
might
create
the
club
belloc
was
not
one
of
the
contributors
but
hugh
law
wrote
ably
on
ireland
hammond
on
south
africa
and
conrad
noel
henry
nevinson
and
masterman
on
other
aspects
of
the
political
scene
the
whole
book
is
on
a
fairly
high
level
but
chesterton
essay
was
the
only
one
much
noticed
by
reviewers
it
was
the
introductory
chapter
far
longer
than
any
of
the
others
and
gave
the
key
to
the
whole
book
entitled
the
idea
of
patriotism
it
was
like
napoleon
of
notting
which
it
does
much
to
illumine
a
plea
for
patriotism
that
was
really
for
england
and
not
for
the
british
empire
such
a
patriotism
recognizes
the
limitations
proper
to
nationality
and
admits
nay
admires
other
patriotisms
for
other
nations
thus
in
chesterton
eyes
a
true
english
patriot
should
also
be
an
ardent
home
ruler
for
ireland
since
ireland
too
was
a
nation
he
stressed
the
danger
that
the
nationhood
of
england
should
be
absorbed
and
lost
in
the
imperial
idea
the
claim
that
in
an
empire
the
various
races
could
learn
much
from
one
another
he
considered
a
bit
of
special
pleading
on
the
part
of
imperialists
england
had
learned
much
from
france
and
germany
but
although
ireland
had
much
to
teach
we
had
not
learned
from
ireland
the
real
patriotism
of
the
englishman
had
been
dimmed
both
by
the
emphasis
on
the
imperial
idea
and
by
the
absence
of
roots
in
his
own
land
the
governing
classes
had
destroyed
those
roots
and
had
almost
forgotten
the
existence
of
the
people
from
the
dregs
and
of
the
population
a
vast
empire
had
been
created
but
the
people
of
england
were
not
allowed
to
colonize
england
the
education
bill
of
brought
in
by
the
conservatives
and
giving
financial
support
to
church
schools
saw
gilbert
in
general
agreement
with
the
liberal
attacks
he
did
not
yet
appreciate
the
catholic
idea
that
education
must
be
of
one
piece
and
he
did
not
think
it
fair
that
the
country
should
support
specifically
catholic
schools
parents
could
give
at
home
the
religious
instruction
they
wanted
their
children
to
have
but
with
that
fairness
of
mind
which
made
it
so
hard
for
him
to
be
a
party
man
he
saw
why
the
liberal
compromise
of
simple
bible
teaching
for
all
in
the
state
schools
could
not
be
expected
to
satisfy
catholics
he
wrote
to
the
news
the
bible
compromise
is
certainly
in
favour
of
the
protestant
view
of
the
bible
the
thing
properly
stated
is
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
protestant
christianity
believes
that
there
is
a
divine
record
in
a
book
that
everyone
ought
to
have
free
access
to
that
book
that
everyone
who
gets
hold
of
it
can
save
his
soul
by
it
whether
he
finds
it
in
a
library
or
picks
it
off
a
dustcart
catholic
christianity
believes
that
there
is
a
divine
army
or
league
upon
earth
called
the
church
that
all
men
should
be
induced
to
join
it
that
any
man
who
joins
it
can
save
his
soul
by
it
without
ever
opening
any
of
the
old
books
of
the
church
at
all
the
bible
is
only
one
of
the
institutions
of
catholicism
like
its
rites
or
its
priesthood
it
thinks
the
bible
only
efficient
when
taken
as
part
of
the
church
this
being
so
a
child
could
see
that
if
you
have
the
bible
taught
alone
anyhow
by
anybody
you
do
definitely
decide
in
favour
of
the
first
view
of
the
bible
and
against
the
second
discussing
a
few
years
later
whether
it
was
possible
or
satisfactory
to
teach
the
bible
simply
as
literature
he
put
his
finger
on
the
catholic
objection
i
should
not
mind
he
said
children
being
told
about
mohammed
because
i
am
not
a
mohammedan
if
i
were
a
mohammedan
i
should
very
much
want
to
know
what
they
were
told
about
him
while
as
for
the
unfortunate
teacher
in
case
a
child
should
ask
if
the
things
in
the
bible
happened
either
the
teacher
must
answer
him
insincerely
and
that
is
immorality
or
he
must
answer
him
sincerely
and
that
is
sectarian
education
or
he
must
refuse
to
answer
him
at
all
and
that
is
first
of
all
bad
manners
and
a
sort
of
timid
tyranny
chesterton
liberalism
received
a
further
shock
from
the
fact
that
liberals
in
attacking
the
bill
were
attacking
also
the
catholic
faith
and
raising
the
cry
of
no
popery
in
a
correspondence
with
clifford
he
reminded
him
of
how
they
had
stood
together
against
popular
fanaticism
during
the
boer
war
there
are
two
cries
always
capable
of
raising
the
english
in
their
madness
one
that
the
union
jack
is
being
pulled
down
and
one
that
the
pope
is
being
set
up
and
upon
the
man
who
raises
one
of
them
responsibility
will
lie
heavy
till
the
last
day
for
when
they
are
raised
the
best
are
mixed
with
the
worst
every
rational
compromise
is
dashed
to
pieces
every
opponent
is
given
credit
for
the
worst
that
the
worst
of
his
allies
has
by
his
worst
enemy
been
said
to
have
said
that
horror
of
darkness
swept
across
us
when
the
war
began
beyond
all
question
this
is
true
that
if
we
choose
to
fight
on
the
no
popery
cry
we
may
win
but
i
can
imagine
something
of
which
i
should
be
prouder
than
of
any
victory
the
memory
that
we
had
shown
our
difference
from
chamberlain
simply
and
finally
in
this
that
to
our
hand
had
lain
as
it
once
laid
to
his
an
old
an
effectual
an
infallible
and
a
filthy
weapon
and
that
we
let
it
lie
letter
to
the
october
yet
it
was
fairly
easy
to
be
a
liberal
in
opposition
at
the
elections
of
which
the
liberals
lost
and
which
they
won
chesterton
canvassed
for
the
liberal
party
charles
masterman
used
to
tell
a
story
of
canvassing
a
street
in
his
company
both
started
at
the
same
end
on
opposite
sides
of
the
road
masterman
completed
his
side
and
came
back
on
the
other
to
find
chesterton
still
earnestly
arguing
at
the
first
house
for
he
was
passionately
serious
in
his
belief
that
the
liberal
party
stood
for
a
real
renewal
even
revolution
in
the
life
of
england
at
the
present
moment
of
victory
says
the
report
of
a
speech
by
gilbert
following
the
great
swing
of
the
liberal
party
into
power
in
he
called
for
that
magnanimity
towards
the
defeated
that
characterized
all
great
conquerors
it
was
important
that
all
should
develop
even
the
tory
it
needed
the
experience
of
seeing
the
liberal
party
in
power
to
shake
his
faith
in
the
new
house
of
commons
the
conservatives
were
in
a
minority
against
them
were
the
two
old
parties
the
liberals
and
the
irish
members
who
were
in
general
allied
to
them
and
a
small
group
forming
a
new
party
known
as
labour
the
labour
members
who
got
into
parliament
in
and
were
regarded
by
conservatives
as
being
a
kind
of
extension
of
the
liberal
party
such
a
liberal
as
chesterton
saw
them
there
with
delight
and
although
he
would
still
have
called
himself
a
liberal
he
at
first
hoped
in
the
labour
men
as
something
more
truly
expressive
of
the
people
wishes
in
an
introduction
to
workhouse
to
a
life
of
will
crooks
gilbert
expressed
a
good
deal
of
his
own
political
philosophy
as
a
democrat
he
believed
in
the
ideal
of
direct
government
by
the
people
but
obviously
this
was
only
possible
in
a
world
that
was
also
his
ideal
a
world
consisting
of
small
and
even
of
very
small
states
the
democrat
usual
alternative
representative
government
was
gilbert
said
symbolic
in
character
just
as
religious
symbolism
may
for
a
time
represent
a
real
emotion
and
then
for
a
time
cease
to
represent
anything
so
representative
government
may
for
a
time
represent
the
people
and
for
a
time
cease
to
represent
anything
further
the
very
idea
of
representation
itself
involved
two
perfectly
distinct
notions
a
man
throws
a
shadow
or
he
throws
a
stone
in
the
first
sense
it
is
supposed
that
the
representative
is
like
the
thing
he
represents
in
the
second
case
it
is
only
supposed
that
the
representative
is
useful
to
the
thing
he
represents
workmen
like
conservatives
sent
men
to
parliament
not
to
show
what
they
themselves
were
like
but
to
attack
the
other
party
in
their
name
the
labour
members
as
a
class
are
not
representatives
but
missiles
working
men
are
not
at
all
like
keir
hardie
if
it
comes
to
likeness
working
men
are
more
like
the
duke
of
devonshire
but
they
throw
keir
hardie
at
the
duke
of
devonshire
knowing
that
he
is
so
curiously
shaped
as
to
hurt
anything
at
which
he
is
thrown
in
the
same
way
balfour
was
entirely
unlike
the
tory
squires
who
used
him
as
a
weapon
to
this
rule
that
men
do
not
choose
to
be
represented
by
their
like
chesterton
took
will
crooks
as
the
one
exception
introduction
to
workhouse
to
p
xv
you
have
not
yet
seen
the
english
people
in
politics
it
has
not
yet
entered
politics
liberals
do
not
represent
it
tories
do
not
represent
it
labour
members
on
the
whole
represent
it
rather
less
than
tories
or
liberals
when
it
enters
politics
it
will
bring
with
it
a
trail
of
all
the
things
that
politicians
detest
prejudices
as
against
hospitals
superstitions
as
about
funerals
a
thirst
for
respectability
passing
that
of
the
middle
classes
a
faith
in
the
family
which
will
knock
to
pieces
half
the
socialism
of
europe
if
ever
that
people
enters
politics
it
will
sweep
away
most
of
our
revolutionists
as
mere
pedants
it
will
be
able
to
point
only
to
one
figure
powerful
pathetic
humorous
and
very
humble
who
bore
in
any
way
upon
his
face
the
sign
and
star
of
its
authority
p
xx
it
was
sad
enough
after
this
to
see
will
crooks
fathering
one
of
those
very
bills
for
the
interference
with
family
life
which
chesterton
most
hated
but
indeed
the
years
that
followed
the
election
are
a
story
of
a
steadily
growing
disillusionment
with
the
realities
of
representative
government
in
england
chesterton
wrote
regularly
for
the
and
was
regarded
as
one
of
their
most
valuable
contributors
but
when
following
an
attack
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
liberal
leader
over
the
sale
of
peerages
he
sent
in
an
article
on
the
subject
the
editor
gardiner
wrote
july
i
have
left
your
article
out
tonight
not
because
i
do
not
entirely
agree
with
its
point
of
view
but
because
just
at
this
moment
it
would
look
like
backing
lea
unmannerly
attack
on
i
am
keeping
the
article
in
type
for
a
later
occasion
when
the
general
question
is
not
complicated
with
a
particularly
offensive
incident
it
was
a
test
case
and
it
seemed
to
chesterton
not
a
question
of
good
manners
but
of
something
far
more
fundamental
the
assertion
had
been
made
in
the
house
of
commons
that
peerages
were
being
sold
and
that
the
price
of
such
sales
was
the
chief
support
of
the
secret
party
funds
but
the
was
a
liberal
paper
and
this
was
an
attack
on
the
liberal
party
chesterton
replied
july
i
am
sure
you
know
by
this
time
that
i
never
resent
the
exclusion
of
my
articles
as
such
i
should
always
trust
your
literary
judgment
if
it
were
a
matter
of
literature
only
and
i
daresay
you
have
often
saved
me
from
an
indiscretion
and
your
readers
from
a
bore
unfortunately
this
matter
of
the
party
funds
is
not
one
of
that
sort
my
conscience
does
not
often
bother
you
but
just
now
the
animal
is
awake
and
roaring
your
paper
has
always
championed
the
rights
of
conscience
so
mine
naturally
goes
to
you
if
you
disagreed
with
me
it
would
be
another
matter
but
since
you
agree
with
me
as
i
was
sure
you
would
it
becomes
simply
a
question
of
which
is
the
more
important
politeness
or
political
morality
i
agree
that
lea
did
go
to
the
point
of
being
unmannerly
so
did
plimsoll
so
did
bradlaugh
so
did
the
irish
members
but
surely
it
would
be
a
very
terrible
thing
if
anyone
could
say
the
suppressed
all
demand
for
the
plimsoll
line
or
the
did
not
join
in
asking
for
bradlaugh
political
rights
i
am
sure
that
this
is
not
your
idea
you
think
that
this
matter
can
be
better
raised
later
on
i
am
convinced
of
its
urgency
i
am
so
passionately
convinced
of
its
urgency
that
if
you
will
not
help
me
to
raise
it
now
i
must
try
some
other
channel
they
are
going
on
monday
to
raise
a
breach
of
privilege
which
is
simply
an
aristocratic
censorship
of
the
press
in
order
to
crush
this
question
through
the
man
who
raised
it
and
to
crush
it
forever
i
have
said
that
i
think
lea
questions
violent
and
needless
but
they
are
not
attacking
his
questions
they
are
attacking
his
letter
which
contains
nothing
that
i
do
not
think
probably
nothing
that
you
do
not
think
lea
is
to
be
humiliated
and
broken
because
he
said
that
titles
are
bought
as
they
are
because
he
said
that
poor
members
are
reminded
of
their
dependence
on
the
party
funds
as
they
are
because
he
said
that
all
this
was
hypocrisy
of
public
life
as
it
is
one
thing
is
quite
certain
unless
some
liberal
journalists
speak
on
monday
or
tuesday
the
secret
funds
and
the
secret
powers
are
safe
these
parliamentary
votes
mark
eras
they
are
meant
to
and
that
vote
will
not
mark
a
defence
of
b
the
letter
had
nothing
to
do
with
b
it
will
mark
the
final
decision
that
any
repetition
of
what
lea
said
in
his
letter
is
an
insult
to
the
house
that
is
any
protest
against
bought
titles
will
be
an
insult
to
the
house
any
protest
against
secret
funds
will
be
an
insult
to
the
house
i
would
willingly
burn
my
article
if
i
were
only
sure
you
would
publish
one
yourself
tomorrow
on
the
same
lines
but
if
not
here
is
at
least
one
thing
you
can
do
an
article
even
signed
may
perhaps
commit
the
paper
too
much
but
your
paper
can
not
be
committed
by
publishing
a
letter
from
me
stating
my
opinions
it
might
publish
a
letter
from
joe
chamberlain
stating
his
opinions
i
therefore
send
you
a
short
letter
pointing
out
the
evil
and
disassociating
it
as
far
as
possible
from
the
indiscretions
of
lea
i
am
sure
you
will
publish
this
for
it
is
the
mere
statement
of
a
private
opinion
and
as
i
am
not
an
i
can
say
what
i
like
about
parliament
you
will
not
mind
my
confessing
to
you
my
conviction
and
determination
in
this
matter
i
do
not
think
we
could
quarrel
even
if
we
had
to
separate
the
letter
was
published
and
was
quoted
in
the
house
of
commons
by
lord
robert
cecil
amid
general
applause
but
it
was
twenty
years
before
a
bill
was
passed
that
forbade
this
particular
unpleasantness
while
political
corruption
stirred
chesterton
deeply
i
think
his
outlook
was
even
more
affected
by
the
progressive
socialism
of
liberal
legislation
he
had
honestly
believed
that
the
liberal
party
stood
on
the
whole
for
liberty
he
found
that
it
stood
increasingly
for
daily
and
hourly
interference
with
the
lives
of
the
people
he
found
too
that
the
liberal
papers
which
he
held
should
have
been
foremost
in
criticism
of
these
measures
were
as
determined
to
uphold
measures
brought
in
by
a
liberal
government
as
they
had
been
to
attack
anything
that
the
tories
brought
forward
it
has
been
well
said
by
belloc
that
chesterton
could
never
write
as
a
party
man
but
to
the
ordinary
party
newspaper
such
an
attitude
was
utterly
incomprehensible
i
think
that
we
can
also
see
at
this
point
how
alien
his
fundamental
outlook
was
from
that
even
of
the
best
members
of
his
own
party
a
great
admirer
said
to
me
the
other
day
that
it
had
taken
her
a
long
time
to
appreciate
sociology
you
see
i
was
brought
up
to
think
that
it
was
quite
right
for
the
poor
to
have
their
teeth
brushed
by
officials
this
is
undoubtedly
the
normal
socialistic
outlook
and
the
outlook
most
abhorrent
to
chesterton
the
philanthropist
he
once
said
is
not
a
brother
he
is
a
supercilious
aunt
the
five
years
of
liberal
government
had
been
disillusioning
to
many
others
besides
belloc
and
the
chesterton
brothers
probably
many
men
in
newspaper
offices
and
elsewhere
continued
vaguely
to
support
the
party
to
which
their
own
paper
belonged
but
there
were
others
who
were
in
those
days
going
through
a
struggle
between
principles
and
party
which
became
increasingly
acute
gilbert
has
described
his
own
feelings
in
a
review
of
galsworthy
play
written
several
years
later
during
the
first
world
war
the
author
of
suffers
one
simple
and
amazing
delusion
he
imagines
that
in
those
politics
liberalism
was
on
the
side
of
labour
on
this
point
at
least
i
can
correct
him
from
the
most
concrete
experience
in
the
newspaper
office
where
his
hero
lingered
wondering
how
much
longer
he
could
stand
its
pacifism
i
was
lingering
and
wondering
how
much
longer
i
could
stand
its
complete
and
fundamental
capitalism
its
invariable
alliance
with
the
employer
its
invariable
hostility
to
the
striker
no
such
scene
as
that
in
which
the
liberal
editor
paced
the
room
raving
about
his
hopes
of
a
revolution
ever
occurred
in
the
liberal
newspaper
office
that
i
knew
the
least
hint
of
a
revolution
would
have
caused
quite
as
much
horror
there
as
in
the
offices
of
the
on
nothing
was
the
pacifist
more
pacifist
than
upon
that
point
no
workman
so
genuine
as
the
workman
who
figures
in
ever
figured
among
such
liberals
the
fact
is
that
such
liberalism
was
in
no
way
whatever
on
the
side
of
labour
on
the
contrary
it
was
on
the
side
of
the
labour
party
both
chesterton
and
belloc
had
begun
to
point
out
that
a
free
press
had
almost
disappeared
from
england
the
revenue
of
most
of
the
newspapers
depended
not
on
subscriptions
but
on
advertisement
therefore
nothing
could
be
said
in
them
which
was
displeasing
to
their
wealthy
advertisers
nor
was
this
the
worst
of
it
very
rich
men
were
often
owners
of
half
a
dozen
papers
or
more
and
dictated
their
policy
an
outstanding
example
was
alfred
harmsworth
lord
northcliffe
whose
newspapers
ranged
from
the
through
the
to
thus
to
every
section
of
the
english
people
harmsworth
was
able
to
convey
day
by
day
such
news
as
he
thought
best
together
with
his
own
outlook
and
philosophy
of
life
such
as
it
was
still
worse
the
had
not
lost
in
the
eyes
of
europe
to
say
nothing
of
america
that
reputation
it
had
held
so
long
of
being
official
expression
of
english
opinion
it
was
still
the
of
trollope
day
the
maker
of
ministries
or
their
undoing
in
the
days
of
a
free
press
a
paper
held
such
a
position
in
virtue
of
the
talents
of
its
staff
editors
were
then
powerful
individuals
and
would
brook
little
interference
but
today
the
editor
was
commonly
only
the
mouthpiece
of
the
owner
it
is
surprising
that
gilbert
and
the
official
liberal
press
so
long
tolerated
one
another
the
and
other
papers
owned
by
cadbury
of
cadbury
cocoa
were
often
referred
to
as
the
cocoa
press
and
it
happened
that
it
was
not
in
the
end
political
disagreement
alone
that
brought
the
alliance
to
an
end
in
one
of
gilbert
poems
in
praise
of
wine
are
the
lines
cocoa
is
a
cad
and
coward
cocoa
is
a
vulgar
beast
in
the
he
tells
us
that
after
he
had
published
the
poem
he
felt
he
could
write
no
longer
for
the
he
went
from
the
to
the
to
the
editor
of
which
he
wrote
that
the
had
come
to
stand
for
almost
everything
i
disagree
with
and
i
thought
i
had
better
resign
before
the
next
great
measure
of
social
reform
made
it
illegal
to
go
on
strike
was
a
considerable
asset
to
any
paper
and
had
recently
been
referred
to
by
shaw
in
a
debate
with
belloc
as
a
flourishing
property
of
mr
cadbury
politically
the
break
was
bound
to
come
for
even
when
was
published
gilbert
chesterton
had
reached
the
stage
of
saying
as
much
as
ever
i
did
more
than
ever
i
did
i
believe
in
liberalism
but
there
was
a
rosy
time
of
innocence
when
i
believed
in
liberals
at
this
time
too
he
infuriated
an
orthodox
liberal
journalist
by
saying
of
the
party
leaders
some
of
them
are
very
nice
old
gentlemen
some
of
them
are
very
nasty
old
gentlemen
and
some
of
them
are
old
without
being
gentlemen
at
all
an
orthodox
church
journalist
in
a
periodical
charmingly
entitled
got
angrier
yet
a
certain
chesterton
he
wrote
had
when
speaking
for
the
in
paul
chapter
house
remarked
the
best
of
his
majesty
ministers
are
agnostics
and
the
worst
devil
worshippers
cries
out
we
only
mention
this
vulgar
falsehood
because
we
regret
that
an
association
with
which
the
names
of
many
of
our
respected
ecclesiastics
are
connected
should
have
allowed
the
bad
taste
and
want
of
all
gentlemanly
feeling
displayed
by
the
words
quoted
to
have
passed
unchallenged
vulgar
falsehood
is
surely
charming
but
perhaps
even
deeper
than
his
disillusionment
with
any
party
was
his
growing
sense
of
the
unreality
of
the
political
scene
he
has
described
it
in
the
i
was
finding
it
difficult
to
believe
in
politics
because
the
reality
seemed
almost
unreal
as
compared
with
the
reputation
or
the
report
i
could
give
twenty
instances
to
indicate
what
i
mean
but
they
would
be
no
more
than
indications
because
the
doubt
itself
was
doubtful
i
remember
going
to
a
great
liberal
club
and
walking
about
in
a
large
crowded
room
somewhere
at
the
end
of
which
a
bald
gentleman
with
a
beard
was
reading
something
from
a
manuscript
in
a
low
voice
it
was
hardly
unreasonable
that
we
did
not
listen
to
him
because
we
could
not
in
any
case
have
heard
but
i
think
a
very
large
number
of
us
did
not
even
see
him
it
is
possible
though
not
certain
that
one
or
other
of
us
asked
carelessly
what
was
supposed
to
be
happening
in
the
other
corner
of
the
large
hall
next
morning
i
saw
across
the
front
of
my
liberal
paper
in
gigantic
headlines
the
phrase
lord
spencer
unfurls
the
banner
under
this
were
other
remarks
also
in
large
letters
about
how
he
had
blown
the
trumpet
for
free
trade
and
how
the
blast
would
ring
through
england
and
rally
all
the
it
did
appear
on
careful
examination
that
the
inaudible
remarks
which
the
old
gentleman
had
read
from
the
manuscript
were
concerned
with
economic
arguments
for
free
trade
and
very
excellent
arguments
too
for
all
i
know
but
the
contrast
between
what
that
orator
was
to
the
people
who
heard
him
and
what
he
was
to
the
thousands
of
who
did
not
hear
him
was
so
huge
a
hiatus
and
disproportion
that
i
do
not
think
i
ever
quite
got
over
it
i
knew
henceforward
what
was
meant
or
what
might
be
meant
by
a
scene
in
the
house
or
a
challenge
from
the
platform
or
any
of
those
sensational
events
which
take
place
in
the
newspapers
and
nowhere
else
pp
as
in
chesterton
had
formulated
his
religious
beliefs
so
in
wrong
with
the
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
sociology
it
will
be
remembered
that
giving
evidence
before
the
commission
on
the
censorship
chesterton
declared
himself
to
be
concerned
only
with
the
good
and
happiness
of
the
english
people
where
he
differed
from
nearly
every
other
social
reformer
was
that
he
believed
that
they
should
themselves
decide
what
was
for
their
own
good
and
happiness
the
body
of
ideas
says
monsignor
knox
of
gilbert
sociology
which
he
labelled
rather
carelessly
is
a
body
of
ideas
which
still
lasts
and
i
think
will
last
but
it
is
not
exactly
a
doctrine
or
a
philosophy
it
is
simply
chesterton
reaction
to
life
june
it
may
be
said
that
a
man
philosophy
is
in
the
main
a
formulation
of
his
reaction
to
life
anyhow
life
seems
to
be
the
operative
word
for
it
is
the
word
that
best
conveys
the
richness
of
this
first
book
of
chesterton
sociology
all
the
wealth
of
life
joys
experiences
is
poured
into
his
view
of
man
and
man
destiny
already
developing
manhood
to
its
fullest
potential
he
found
in
this
book
a
new
form
of
expression
to
quote
monsignor
knox
again
i
call
that
man
intellectually
great
who
is
an
artist
in
thought
i
call
that
man
intellectually
great
who
can
work
equally
well
in
any
medium
the
worked
surprisingly
well
in
the
medium
of
sociology
he
had
intended
to
call
the
book
what
wrong
and
it
begins
on
this
note
of
interrogation
the
chapter
called
the
medical
mistake
is
a
brilliant
attack
on
the
idea
that
we
must
begin
social
reform
by
diagnosing
the
disease
it
is
the
whole
definition
and
dignity
of
man
that
in
social
matters
we
must
actually
find
the
cure
before
we
find
the
disease
the
thing
that
is
most
terribly
wrong
with
our
modern
civilisation
is
that
it
has
lost
not
only
health
but
the
clear
picture
of
health
the
doctor
called
in
to
diagnose
a
bodily
illness
does
not
say
we
have
had
too
much
scarlet
fever
let
us
try
a
little
measles
for
a
change
but
the
sociological
doctor
does
offer
to
the
dispossessed
proletarian
a
cure
which
says
chesterton
is
only
another
kind
of
disease
we
can
not
work
towards
a
social
ideal
until
we
are
certain
what
that
ideal
should
be
we
must
therefore
begin
with
principles
and
we
are
to
find
those
principles
in
the
nature
of
man
largely
through
a
study
of
his
history
man
has
had
historically
and
man
needs
for
his
fulfilment
the
family
the
home
and
the
possession
of
property
the
notion
of
property
has
for
the
modern
age
been
defiled
by
the
corruptions
of
capitalism
but
modern
capitalism
is
really
a
negation
of
property
because
it
is
a
denial
of
its
limitations
he
summarises
this
idea
with
one
of
his
most
brilliant
illustrations
it
is
the
negation
of
property
that
the
duke
of
sutherland
should
have
all
the
farms
in
one
estate
just
as
it
would
be
the
negation
of
marriage
if
he
had
all
our
wives
in
one
harem
but
property
in
its
real
meaning
is
almost
the
condition
for
the
survival
of
the
family
it
is
its
protection
it
is
the
opportunity
of
its
development
god
has
the
joy
of
unlimited
creation
he
can
make
something
out
of
nothing
but
he
has
given
to
man
the
joy
of
limited
creation
man
can
make
something
out
of
anything
fruitful
strife
with
limitations
with
limits
that
are
strict
and
even
small
all
this
belongs
to
the
artist
but
also
to
the
average
man
property
is
merely
the
art
of
the
democracy
the
family
protected
by
the
possession
of
some
degree
of
property
will
grow
by
its
own
laws
what
are
these
laws
clearly
there
are
two
sets
of
problems
one
concerned
with
life
within
the
family
the
other
with
the
relation
of
the
family
to
the
state
these
two
sets
of
problems
provide
the
of
the
book
on
both
chesterton
felt
that
there
had
been
insufficient
thinking
thus
he
says
of
the
first
there
is
no
in
the
thing
at
all
no
root
query
of
what
sex
is
of
whether
it
alters
this
or
that
and
of
the
second
it
is
quite
unfair
to
say
that
socialists
believe
in
the
state
but
do
not
believe
in
the
family
but
it
is
true
to
say
that
socialists
are
especially
engaged
in
strengthening
and
renewing
the
state
and
they
are
not
especially
engaged
in
strengthening
and
renewing
the
family
they
are
not
doing
anything
to
define
the
functions
of
father
mother
and
child
as
such
they
have
no
firm
instinctive
sense
of
one
thing
being
in
its
nature
private
and
another
public
it
is
precisely
this
kind
of
that
the
book
does
in
the
free
family
there
will
be
a
division
of
the
two
sides
of
life
between
the
man
and
the
woman
the
man
must
be
to
a
certain
extent
a
specialist
he
must
do
one
thing
well
enough
to
earn
the
daily
bread
the
woman
is
the
universalist
she
must
do
a
hundred
things
for
the
safeguarding
and
development
of
the
home
the
modern
fad
of
talking
of
the
narrowness
of
domesticity
especially
provoked
chesterton
i
can
not
he
said
with
the
utmost
energy
of
imagination
conceive
what
they
mean
when
domesticity
for
instance
is
called
drudgery
all
the
difficulty
arises
from
a
double
meaning
in
the
word
if
drudgery
only
means
dreadfully
hard
work
i
admit
the
woman
drudges
in
the
home
as
a
man
might
drudge
at
the
cathedral
of

if
it

that
the

is
more
heavy

it
is

i
can
understand
how

i
can
not
imagine
how
it
could
narrow

how
can
it

i
will
pity

of

i
will
never

her
for
its
smallness
wrong
with
the
chapter
the
emancipation
of
domesticity
while
he
was
writing
these
pages
and
after
their
appearance
in
print
was
constantly
asked
to
debate
the
question
of
women
suffrage
he
was
an
partly
because
he
was
a
democrat
the
suffrage
agitation
in
england
was
conducted
by
a
handful
of
women
mainly
of
the
upper
classes
and
it
gave
cecil
chesterton
immense
pleasure
to
head
articles
on
the
movement
with
the
words
votes
for
ladies
too
felt
that
the
suffrage
agitation
was
really
doing
harm
by
dragging
a
red
herring
across
the
path
of
necessary
social
reform
if
the
vast
majority
of
women
did
not
want
votes
it
was
undemocratic
to
force
votes
upon
them
also
if
rich
men
had
oppressed
poor
men
all
through
the
course
of
history
it
was
exceedingly
probable
that
rich
women
would
also
oppress
poor
women
both
in
wrong
with
the
and
in
debating
on
the
subject
chesterton
brushed
aside
as
absurd
and
irrelevant
the
suggestion
that
women
were
inferior
to
men
and
what
was
called
the
physical
force
argument
but
he
did
maintain
that
if
the
vote
meant
anything
at
all
which
it
probably
did
not
in
the
england
he
was
living
in
it
meant
that
side
of
life
which
belongs
to
masculinity
and
which
the
normal
woman
dislikes
and
rather
despises
all
we
men
had
grown
used
to
our
wives
and
mothers
and
grandmothers
and
great
aunts
all
pouring
a
chorus
of
contempt
upon
our
hobbies
of
sport
drink
and
party
politics
and
now
comes
miss
pankhurst
with
tears
in
her
eyes
owning
that
all
the
women
were
wrong
and
all
the
men
were
right
we
told
our
wives
that
parliament
had
sat
late
on
most
essential
business
but
it
never
crossed
our
minds
that
our
wives
would
believe
it
we
said
that
everyone
must
have
a
vote
in
the
country
similarly
our
wives
said
that
no
one
must
have
a
pipe
in
the
in
both
cases
the
idea
was
the
same
it
does
not
matter
much
but
if
you
let
those
things
slide
there
is
chaos
we
said
that
lord
huggins
or
buggins
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
country
we
knew
quite
well
that
nothing
is
necessary
to
the
country
except
that
the
men
should
be
men
and
the
women
women
we
knew
this
we
thought
the
women
knew
it
even
more
clearly
and
we
thought
the
women
would
say
it
suddenly
without
warning
the
women
have
begun
to
say
all
the
nonsense
that
we
ourselves
hardly
believed
when
we
said
it
from
chapter
vii
modern
all
the
agitated
reformers
who
were
running
about
and
offering
their
various
nostrums
were
prepared
to
confess
that
something
had
gone
very
wrong
with
modern
civilisation
but
they
suggested
that
what
was
wrong
with
the
present
generation
of
adults
could
be
set
right
for
the
coming
generation
by
means
of
education
in
the
last
part
of
the
book
education
or
the
mistake
about
the
child
he
put
the
unanswerable
question
how
are
we
to
give
what
we
have
not
got
to
hear
people
talk
one
would
think
education
was
some
sort
of
magic
chemistry
by
which
out
of
a
laborious
of
hygienic
meals
baths
and
freehand
drawing
we
can
produce
something
splendid
by
accident
we
can
create
what
we
can
not
conceive
the
social
reformers
who
were
talking
about
education
seem
not
to
have
seen
very
clearly
what
they
meant
by
the
word
they
argued
about
whether
it
meant
putting
ideas
into
the
child
or
drawing
ideas
out
of
the
child
in
any
case
as
chesterton
pointed
out
you
must
choose
which
kind
of
ideas
you
are
going
to
put
in
or
even
which
kind
you
are
going
to
draw
out
there
is
indeed
in
each
living
creature
a
collection
of
forces
and
functions
but
education
means
producing
these
in
particular
shapes
and
training
them
for
particular
purposes
or
it
means
nothing
at
all
but
to
decide
what
they
were
trying
to
produce
was
altogether
too
much
for
the
men
who
were
directing
education
in
our
board
schools
the
public
schools
of
england
were
often
the
target
of
attacks
but
they
had
he
declared
one
immense
superiority
over
the
board
schools
the
men
who
directed
them
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
and
were
on
the
whole
successful
in
producing
it
those
responsible
for
the
board
schools
seemed
to
have
no
idea
excepting
that
of
feebly
imitating
the
public
schools
one
disadvantage
of
this
was
that
at
its
worst
and
at
its
best
the
public
school
idea
could
only
be
applicable
to
a
small
governing
class
the
other
disadvantage
was
that
whereas
in
the
public
schools
the
masters
were
working
with
the
parents
and
trying
to
give
the
boys
the
same
general
shape
as
their
homes
would
give
them
the
board
schools
were
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
the
schoolmaster
of
the
poor
never
worked
with
the
parents
often
he
ignored
them
sometimes
he
positively
worked
against
them
such
education
was
chesterton
held
the
very
reverse
of
that
which
would
prevail
in
a
true
democracy
we
have
had
enough
education
for
the
people
we
want
education
by
the
people
chesterton
felt
keenly
that
while
the
faddists
were
perfectly
prepared
to
take
the
children
out
of
the
hands
of
any
parents
who
happened
to
be
poor
they
had
not
really
the
courage
of
their
own
convictions
they
would
expatiate
upon
methods
they
could
not
define
their
aims
they
would
take
refuge
in
such
meaningless
terms
as
progress
or
efficiency
or
success
they
were
not
prepared
to
say
what
they
wanted
to
succeed
in
producing
towards
what
goal
they
were
progressing
or
what
was
the
test
of
efficiency
and
part
of
this
inability
arose
from
their
curious
fear
of
the
past
most
movements
of
reform
have
looked
to
the
past
for
great
part
of
their
inspiration
to
reform
means
to
shape
anew
and
he
pointed
out
that
every
revolution
involves
the
idea
of
a
return
on
this
point
attacked
two
popular
sayings
one
was
you
ca
put
the
clock
back
but
he
said
you
can
and
you
do
constantly
the
clock
is
a
piece
of
mechanism
which
can
be
adjusted
by
the
human
finger
there
is
another
proverb
you
have
made
your
bed
so
you
must
lie
on
it
which
again
is
simply
a
lie
if
i
have
made
my
bed
uncomfortable
please
god
i
will
make
it
again
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
this
sort
of
philosophy
should
be
out
of
tune
with
the
socialist
who
looked
with
contempt
on
the
wisdom
of
his
forefathers
it
is
less
easy
to
understand
why
it
was
unacceptable
also
to
most
of
the
tories
one
reviewer
asked
whether
chesterton
was
the
hoariest
of
conservatives
or
the
wildest
of
radicals
and
with
none
of
his
books
are
the
reviews
so
bewildered
as
they
are
with
this
one
the
universe
is
said
the
daily
according
to
the
fancy
of
chesterton
but
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
if
the
deity
were
to
talk
over
matters
with
him
he
would
soon
come
to
see
that
a
chestertonian
cosmos
would
be
no
improvement
on
things
as
they
are
on
the
other
hand
the
remarks
his
boisterous
optimism
will
not
admit
that
there
is
anything
to
sorrow
over
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
the
suggested
that
chesterton
would
find
no
disciples
because
his
converts
would
never
know
from
one
week
to
another
what
they
had
been
converted
to
while
the
felt
that
the
chief
disadvantage
of
the
book
was
that
a
shrewd
reader
can
pretty
accurately
anticipate
chesterton
point
of
view
on
any
subject
whatsoever
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
so
definite
a
line
of
thought
so
abundantly
illustrated
should
not
have
been
clear
to
all
his
readers
some
reviewers
one
supposes
had
not
read
the
book
but
surely
the
was
deliberately
refusing
to
face
a
challenge
when
it
wrote
his
whole
book
is
an
absurdity
but
to
be
absurd
for
three
hundred
pages
on
end
is
itself
a
work
of
genius
that
particular
reviewer
was
shirking
a
serious
issue
he
was
the
official
tory
but
those
whom
i
might
call
the
unofficial
tories
such
men
for
instance
as
my
own
father
received
much
of
this
book
with
delight
and
yet
declined
to
take
chesterton
sociology
seriously
and
i
think
it
is
worth
trying
to
see
why
this
was
the
case
in
a
letter
to
the
outlines
his
own
position
if
you
want
praise
or
blame
for
socialists
i
have
enormous
quantities
of
both
roughly
speaking
i
praise
them
to
infinity
because
they
want
to
smash
modern
society
i
blame
them
to
infinity
because
of
what
they
want
to
put
in
its
place
as
the
smashing
must
i
suppose
come
first
my
practical
sympathies
are
mainly
with
them
letter
to
the
february
such
a
confession
of
faith
seemed
shocking
to
the
honest
tory
and
because
it
shocked
him
he
made
the
mistake
of
calling
it
irresponsible
chesterton
frequently
urged
revolution
as
the
only
possible
means
of
changing
an
intolerable
state
of
things
but
the
word
revolution
suggested
streets
running
with
blood
and
on
the
other
hand
they
had
not
the
very
faintest
conception
of
how
intolerable
the
state
of
things
was
against
which
chesterton
proposed
to
revolt
i
think
it
must
be
said
too
that
he
was
a
little
hazy
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
the
revolution
he
proposed
he
certainly
hoped
to
avoid
the
guillotine
and
even
when
urging
the
restoration
of
the
common
lands
to
the
people
of
england
he
appended
a
note
in
which
he
talked
of
a
land
purchase
scheme
similar
to
that
which
george
wyndham
had
introduced
in
ireland
but
besides
this
tinge
of
vagueness
in
what
he
proposed
there
was
another
weakness
in
his
presentment
of
his
sociology
which
i
think
was
his
chief
weakness
as
a
writer
it
would
be
hard
to
find
anyone
who
got
so
much
out
of
words
proverbs
popular
sayings
he
wrung
every
ounce
of
meaning
out
of
them
he
stood
them
on
their
heads
he
turned
them
inside
out
and
everything
he
said
he
illustrated
with
an
extraordinary
wealth
of
fancy
but
when
you
come
to
illustration
by
way
of
concrete
facts
there
is
a
curious
change
in
his
sociology
he
did
the
same
thing
that
his
best
critics
blamed
in
his
literary
biographies
he
would
take
some
one
fact
and
appear
to
build
upon
it
an
enormous
superstructure
and
then
very
often
it
would
turn
out
that
the
fact
itself
was
inaccurately
set
down
and
the
average
reader
discovering
the
inaccuracy
felt
that
the
entire
superstructure
was
on
a
rotten
foundation
and
had
fallen
with
it
to
the
ground
yet
the
ordinary
reader
was
wrong
the
fact
had
not
been
the
foundation
of
his
thought
but
only
the
thing
that
had
started
him
thinking
if
the
fact
had
not
been
there
at
all
his
thinking
would
have
been
neither
more
nor
less
valid
but
most
readers
could
not
see
the
distinction
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
make
the
point
clear
but
anyone
who
has
read
the
and
the
and
then
read
the
reviews
of
them
will
recognise
what
i
mean
it
was
universally
acknowledged
that
chesterton
might
commit
a
hundred
inaccuracies
and
yet
get
at
the
heart
of
his
subject
in
a
way
that
the
most
painstaking
biographer
and
critic
could
not
emulate
the
more
deeply
one
reads
dickens
or
browning
the
more
even
one
studies
their
lives
the
more
one
is
confirmed
as
to
the
profound
truth
of
the
chesterton
estimate
and
the
genius
of
his
insight
a
superficial
glance
sees
only
the
errors
a
deeper
gaze
discovers
the
truth
it
is
exactly
the
same
with
his
sociology
but
here
we
are
in
a
field
where
there
is
far
more
prejudice
when
chesterton
talked
of
state
interference
and
used
again
and
again
the
same
illustration
that
of
children
whose
hair
was
forcibly
cut
short
in
a
board
school
two
questions
were
asked
by
socialists
was
this
a
solitary
incident
was
it
accurately
reported
when
a
pained
doctor
wrote
to
the
papers
saying
the
incident
had
been
merely
one
of
a
request
to
parents
who
had
gladly
complied
for
fear
their
children
should
catch
things
from
other
and
dirtier
children
it
appeared
as
though
had
built
far
too
much
on
this
one
point
it
was
not
the
case
he
was
not
building
on
the
incident
he
was
illustrating
by
the
incident
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
was
incredibly
careless
in
investigating
such
incidents
and
quite
indifferent
as
to
his
own
accuracy
and
this
was
foolish
for
he
could
have
found
in
police
court
records
in
the
pages
of
and
later
of
the
itself
abundance
of
well
verified
illustrations
of
his
thesis
in
the
same
way
when
he
talked
of
the
robbery
of
the
people
of
england
by
the
great
landlords
he
did
not
take
the
slightest
trouble
to
prove
his
case
to
the
many
who
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
sociological
side
of
english
history
was
only
just
beginning
to
be
explored
to
any
serious
extent
in
the
and
hammond
point
out
to
what
an
extent
they
had
had
to
depend
on
the
home
office
papers
and
contemporary
documents
for
the
mass
of
facts
which
this
book
and
the
brought
for
the
first
time
to
the
knowledge
of
the
general
public
chesterton
had
worked
with
hammond
on
the
for
some
years
just
as
with
his
book
about
shaw
so
too
with
the
background
of
his
sociology
he
could
have
gone
round
the
corner
and
got
the
required
information
he
knew
the
thing
in
general
terms
he
would
not
be
bothered
to
make
that
knowledge
convincing
to
his
readers
if
to
his
genius
for
expounding
ideas
had
been
added
an
awareness
of
the
necessity
of
marshalling
and
presenting
facts
he
must
surely
have
convinced
all
men
of
goodwill
for
in
this
matter
the
facts
were
there
to
marshal
it
was
less
than
a
hundred
years
since
the
last
struggle
of
the
english
yeomen
against
a
wholesale
robbery
and
confiscation
that
catastrophically
altered
the
whole
shape
of
our
country
and
it
seems
to
have
left
no
trace
in
the
memory
of
the
english
poor
in
jane
austen
describes
catherine
morland
finding
the
traces
of
an
imaginary
crime
but
chesterton
comments
that
the
crime
she
failed
to
discover
was
the
very
real
one
that
the
owner
of
northanger
abbey
was
not
an
abbot
the
ordinary
englishman
however
thinks
little
of
a
crime
that
consisted
in
robbing
a
lot
of
lazy
monks
that
they
had
possessed
so
much
of
the
land
of
england
merely
seemed
to
make
the
act
a
more
desirable
one
yet
it
was
a
confiscation
not
so
much
of
monks
land
as
of
the
people
land
administered
by
the
monasteries
what
is
even
less
realised
is
how
much
of
the
structure
of
the
mediaeval
village
remained
after
the
reformation
and
how
widespread
was
small
ownership
nearly
to
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
enclosures
began
estimated
by
the
hammonds
at
five
million
acres
this
land
ceased
in
effect
to
be
the
common
property
of
the
poor
and
became
the
private
property
of
the
rich
this
business
of
the
enclosures
must
be
treated
at
some
little
length
because
it
had
the
same
key
position
in
chesterton
sociological
thinking
as
the
marconi
case
shortly
to
be
discussed
had
in
his
political
in
every
village
of
england
had
been
small
freeholders
copyholders
and
cottagers
all
of
whom
had
varying
degrees
of
possession
in
the
common
lands
which
were
administered
by
a
manorial
court
of
the
village
these
common
lands
were
not
mere
stretches
of
heath
and
gorse
but
consisted
partly
of
arable
cultivated
in
strips
with
strict
rules
of
rotation
partly
of
grazing
land
and
partly
of
wood
and
heath
most
people
in
the
village
had
a
right
to
a
strip
of
arable
to
cut
firing
of
brushwood
and
turf
and
rushes
for
thatch
and
to
pasture
one
or
more
cows
their
pigs
and
their
geese
a
village
cowherd
looked
after
all
the
animals
and
brought
them
back
at
night
cobbett
in
his
to
a
new
edition
of
which
chesterton
wrote
a
preface
reckoned
that
a
cottager
with
a
of
garden
could
well
keep
a
cow
on
his
own
cabbages
plus
commonland
grazing
could
fatten
his
own
pig
and
have
to
buy
very
little
food
for
his
family
except
grain
and
hops
for
and
brewing
he
puts
a
cottager
earnings
working
for
a
farmer
at
about
sh
a
week
this
figure
would
vary
but
the
possession
of
property
in
stock
and
common
rights
would
tide
over
bad
times
a
man
with
fire
and
food
could
be
and
indeed
some
of
the
larger
farmers
witnessing
before
enclosure
enquiry
committees
complained
of
this
very
spirit
of
independence
as
producing
idleness
and
sauciness
the
case
for
the
enclosures
was
that
improved
agricultural
methods
could
not
be
used
in
the
open
fields
more
food
was
grown
for
increasing
town
populations
much
waste
land
ploughed
livestock
immeasurably
improved
only
later
was
the
cost
counted
when
cheap
imported
food
for
these
same
towns
had
slain
english
agriculture
the
compensation
in
small
plots
or
sums
of
money
could
not
for
the
smaller
commoners
replace
what
they
had
lost
even
when
they
succeeded
in
getting
it
claims
had
to
be
made
in
writing
and
few
cottagers
could
write
how
difficult
too
to
reduce
to
its
money
value
a
claim
for
cutting
turf
or
pasturing
pigs
and
geese
a
commissioner
who
had
administered
twenty
enclosure
acts
lamented
to
arthur
young
that
he
had
been
the
means
of
ruining
two
thousand
poor
people
but
the
gulf
was
so
great
between
rich
and
poor
that
all
that
the
commons
had
meant
to
the
poor
was
not
glimpsed
by
the
rich
arthur
young
had
thought
the
benefits
of
common
perfectly
contemptible
but
by
he
was
deeply
repentant
and
trying
in
vain
to
arrest
the
movement
he
had
helped
to
start
before
enclosure
the
english
cottager
had
had
milk
butter
and
cheese
in
plenty
pork
and
bacon
beer
and
bread
his
own
vegetables
although
cobbett
scorned
green
rubbish
for
human
food
and
advised
it
to
be
fed
to
cattle
only
his
own
eggs
and
poultry
after
enclosure
he
could
get
no
milk
for
the
farmers
would
not
sell
it
no
meat
for
his
wages
could
not
buy
it
and
he
no
longer
had
a
pig
to
provide
the
fat
bacon
commended
by
cobbett
working
long
hours
he
lived
on
bread
potatoes
and
tea

these
lord
winchelsea
one
of
the
very
few
landowners
who
resisted
the
trend
of
the
time
mentioned
in
the
house
of
lords
the
discovery
of
four
labourers
starved
to
death
under
a
hedge
and
said
this
was
a
typical
occurrence
at
the
beginning
of
the
enclosure
period
the
industrial
revolution
was
barely
in
its
infancy
a
large
part
of
the
spinning
weaving
and
other
manufactures
was
carried
on
in
the
cottages
of
men
who
had
gardens
they
could
dig
in
and
cows
and
pigs
of
their
own
the
invention
of
power
machines
the
discovery
of
coal
wherewith
those
machines
could
be
worked
led
to
the
concentration
of
factories
in
the
huge
cities
but
it
was
the
drift
from
the
villages
of
dispossessed
men
together
with
the
cheap
child
labour
provided
by
poor
law
guardians
that
made
possible
the
starvation
wages
and
the
tyranny
of
the
factory
system
and
here
the
tyrants
were
largely
of
a
different
class
there
were
some
landowners
who
also
had
factories
and
more
who
possessed
but
many
of
the
manufacturers
had
themselves
come
from
the
class
of
the
dispossessed
successful
manufacturers
made
money
a
great
deal
of
money
many
of
the
men
appeals
gave
the
figures
at
which
the
goods
were
sold
in
contrast
with
their
rate
of
wages
and
the
contrast
is
startling
so
as
the
towns
grew
the
masters
left
the
smoke
they
were
creating
and
bought
country
places
and
became
country
gentlemen
preserved
their
own
game
and
judged
their
own
tenants
and
thus
disappeared
yet
another
section
of
the
ancient
country
folk
for
the
large
landowners
would
seldom
sell
and
the
land
bought
by
the
new
men
was
mostly
the
land
of
small
farmers
and
yeomen
this
was
the
age
of
new
country
houses
with
a
hundred
rooms
and
vast
offices
that
housed
an
army
of
servants
labour
was
cheap
the
descendants
of
those
who
built
just
then
will
tell
you
as
they
gaze
disconsolate
at
their
unwieldy
heritage

and
new
families
alike

or

and

cobbett
rode
rurally
and
angrily
through
the
ruins
of
a
better
england
described
a
century
earlier
by
another
horseman
daniel
defoe
goldsmith
mourned
an
early
example
in
his
deserted
village
but
they
are
the
only
voices
in
an
abundant
literature
jane
austen
is
indeed
the
perfect
example
of
what
chesterton
always
realised
the
ignorance
that
was
almost
innocence
with
which
the
wealthy
had
done
their
work
of
destruction
he
did
not
account
them
as
evil
as
they
would
seem
by
a
mere
summary
of
events
and
what
he
saw
at
the
root
of
those
events
was
in
his
eyes
still
present
england
was
still
possessed
and
still
governed
by
a
minority
the
conservatives
were
a
minority
that
was
rich
the
liberals
a
minority
that
was
mad
and
those
two
minorities
tended
to
join
together
and
rob
and
oppress
the
ordinary
man
in
the
name
of
some
theory
of
progress
and
perfection
thus
the
protestant
reformation
had
closed
the
monasteries
which
were
the
poor
man
inns
in
the
name
of
a
purer
religion
the
economists
had
taken
away
his
land
and
driven
him
into
the
factories
with
a
promise
of
future
wealth
and
prosperity
these
had
been
the
experts
of
their
day
now
the
new
experts
were
telling
him
with
equal
eagerness
that
hygienic
flats
and
communal
kitchens
would
bring
about
for
him
the
new
jerusalem
but
never
did
the
expert
think
of
asking
jones
the
ordinary
man
what
he
himself
wanted
jones
just
wanted
the
divinely
ordinary
things
a
house
of
his
own
and
a
family
life
and
that
was
still
denied
him
as
is
related
in
the
chapter
called
the
homelessness
of
jones
in
a
debate
in
the
oxford
union
maintained
that
the
house
of
lords
was
a
menace
to
the
state
because
it
failed
precisely
in
what
was
supposed
to
be
its
main
function
that
of
conservation
it
had
not
saved
it
had
destroyed
the
church
lands
and
the
common
lands
it
was
ready
to
pass
any
bill
that
affected
only
the
lower
classes
we
are
all
socialists
now
sir
william
harcourt
had
lately
said
and
chesterton
saw
that
socialism
would
mean
merely
further
restriction
of
liberty
and
continued
coercion
of
the
poor
by
the
experts
and
the
rich
so
looking
at
the
past
chesterton
desired
a
restoration
which
he
often
called
a
revolution
there
were
two
forms
of
government
that
might
succeed
a
real
monarchy
in
which
one
ordinary
man
governed
many
ordinary
men
or
a
real
democracy
in
which
many
ordinary
men
governed
themselves
aristocracy
may
have
begun
well
in
england
when
it
was
an
army
protecting
england
when
the
duke
was
a
dux
now
it
was
merely
plutocracy
and
it
had
become
an
army
without
an
enemy
billeted
on
the
people
all
this
and
more
formed
the
background
of
chesterton
mind
but
what
he
wrote
was
a
comment
on
the
scene
not
a
picture
of
it
he
wrote
of
the
terrible
irony
whereby
the
commons
were
enclosing
the
commons
he
spoke
of
the
english
revolution
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
revolution
of
the
rich
against
the
poor
he
mourned
with
goldsmith
the
destruction
of
england
peasantry
he
cried
aloud
like
cobbett
for
he
too
had
discovered
the
murder
of
england
his
mother
but
his
cry
was
unintelligible
and
his
hopes
of
a
resurrection
unmeaning
to
those
who
knew
not
what
had
been
done
to
death
chapter
xviii
the
eye
witness
the
publication
of
wrong
with
the
brings
us
to
gilbert
had
as
we
have
seen
originally
intended
to
call
the
book
wrong
laying
some
emphasis
on
the
note
of
interrogation
it
amused
him
to
perplex
the
casual
visitor
by
going
off
to
his
study
with
the
muttered
remark
i
must
get
on
with
what
wrong
the
change
of
name
and
the
omission
of
the
note
of
interrogation
both
changes
the
act
of
his
publishers
represented
a
certain
loss
for
indeed
gilbert
was
still
asking
himself
what
was
wrong
when
he
was
writing
this
book
although
he
was
very
certain
what
was
right
his
ideals
were
really
a
clear
picture
of
health
his
doubts
about
the
achievement
of
those
ideals
in
the
present
world
and
with
his
present
political
allegiance
were
as
he
suggests
in
the
vague
but
becoming
more
definite
did
this
mean
that
he
ever
looked
hopefully
towards
the
other
big
division
of
the
english
political
scene
the
tory
or
conservative
party
to
which
his
brother
had
once
declared
he
belonged
without
knowing
it
that
would
be
a
simpler
story
than
what
really
happened
in
his
mind
and
i
confess
that
i
am
myself
sufficiently
vague
and
doubtful
about
part
of
what
the
chesterbelloc
believed
they
were
discovering
to
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
describe
it
clearly
cecil
chesterton
and
belloc
set
down
their
views
in
a
book
called
party
gilbert
made
his
clear
in
letters
to
the
liberal
press
the
english
party
system
had
often
enough
been
attacked
for
its
obvious
defects
and
indeed
the
even
livelier
contemporary
was
shouting
for
its
abolition
but
belloc
and
cecil
chesterton
had
their
own
line
their
general
thesis
was
that
not
only
did
the
people
of
england
not
govern
parliament
did
not
govern
either
the
cabinet
governed
and
it
was
chosen
by
the
real
rulers
of
the
party
for
each
party
was
run
by
an
oligarchy
and
run
roughly
on
the
same
lines
lists
were
given
of
families
whose
and
cousins
though
not
yet
their
sisters
and
their
aunts
found
place
in
the
ministry
of
one
or
other
political
party
moreover
the
governing
families
on
both
sides
were
in
many
cases
connected
by
birth
or
marriage
and
all
belonged
to
the
same
social
set
but
money
too
was
useful
men
could
buy
their
way
in
each
party
had
a
fund
and
those
who
could
contribute
largely
had
of
necessity
an
influence
on
party
policy
the
existent
liberal
government
had
brought
to
a
totally
new
peak
the
art
of
swelling
its
fund
by
the
sale
of
titles
which
in
many
instances
meant
the
sale
of
hereditary
governing
powers
since
those
higher
titles
which
carry
with
them
a
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
were
sold
like
the
others
at
a
higher
rate
naturally
for
the
rank
and
file
member
a
political
career
no
longer
meant
the
chance
for
talents
and
courage
to
win
recognition
in
an
open
field
a
man
who
believed
that
his
first
duty
was
to
represent
his
constituents
stood
no
chance
of
advancement
certainly
a
private
member
could
not
introduce
a
bill
as
his
own
and
get
it
debated
on
its
merits
none
of
this
was
new
though
the
book
did
it
rather
exceptionally
well
what
was
new
was
the
theory
that
the
two
party
oligarchies
were
secretly
one
that
the
fights
between
the
parties
were
little
more
than
sham
fights
the
ordinary
party
member
was
unaware
of
this
secret
conspiracy
between
the
leaders
and
would
obey
the
call
of
the
party
whip
and
accept
a
sort
of
military
discipline
with
the
genuine
belief
that
the
defeat
of
his
party
would
mean
disaster
to
his
country
belloc
had
discovered
for
himself
the
impotence
of
the
private
member
he
had
as
we
have
seen
been
elected
to
parliament
by
south
salford
in
as
a
liberal
in
parliament
he
proposed
a
measure
for
the
publication
of
the
names
of
subscribers
to
the
party
funds
naturally
enough
the
proposal
got
nowhere
also
naturally
enough
the
party
funds
were
not
forthcoming
to
support
him
at
the
next
election
he
fought
and
won
the
seat
as
an
independent
at
the
second
election
of
he
declined
to
stand
having
lucidly
explained
to
the
house
of
commons
in
a
final
speech
that
a
seat
there
was
of
no
value
under
the
existing
system
thus
belloc
own
experience
and
a
thousand
other
things
went
to
prove
the
stranglehold
the
rulers
of
the
party
had
on
the
party
but
did
it
prove
or
did
the
book
establish
the
theory
of
a
conspiracy
between
the
small
groups
who
controlled
each
of
the
great
historical
parties
which
was
the
theme
not
only
of
party
but
also
of
belloc
brilliant
political
novels
notably
clutterbuck
and
and
the
bull
of
the
stranglehold
there
was
no
doubt
and
gilbert
soon
found
it
too
much
for
his
own
allegiance
to
the
liberal
party
or
any
other
at
the
election
of
he
addressed
a
liberal
meeting
at
beaconsfield
and
dealt
vigorously
with
constant
tory
questions
and
interjections
from
the
back
of
the
hall
he
obviously
enjoyed
the
fight
and
a
little
later
he
spoke
for
the
league
of
young
liberals
and
was
photographed
standing
at
the
back
of
their
van
but
although
he
went
to
london
to
vote
for
john
burns
in
battersea
and
would
probably
have
continued
to
vote
liberal
or
labour
he
showed
at
a
women
suffrage
meeting
in
a
growing
scepticism
about
the
value
of
the
vote
he
was
reported
as
saying
if
i
voted
for
john
burns
now
i
should
not
be
voting
for
anything
at
all
laughter
it
must
have
been
irritating
that
this
interpolation
laughter
was
liable
to
occur
when
chesterton
was
most
serious
he
did
not
change
quickly
but
in
the
alteration
of
his
outlook
towards
his
party
his
growing
doubt
whether
it
stood
for
any
real
values
he
was
very
serious
in
the
years
that
followed
the
coming
into
power
of
liberalism
there
were
a
multitude
of
acts
described
as
of
little
importance
and
passed
into
law
after
little
or
no
discussion
at
the
same
time
private
members
complained
that
they
could
get
no
attention
for
really
urgent
matters
of
social
reform
the
as
a
party
paper
defended
the
state
of
things
and
talked
of
official
business
and
of
want
of
time
their
attitude
was
vigorously
attacked
by
gilbert
whose
first
letter
ended
with
this
paragraph
who
ever
dreamed
of
getting
perfect
freedom
and
fulness
of
discussion
except
in
heaven
the
case
urged
against
cabinets
is
that
we
have
no
freedom
and
no
discussion
except
that
laid
down
despotically
by
a
few
men
on
front
benches
your
assurance
that
parliament
is
very
busy
is
utterly
vain
it
is
busy
on
things
the
dictators
direct
that
small
men
and
small
questions
get
squeezed
out
among
big
ones
that
is
a
normal
disaster
with
us
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
big
questions
that
get
squeezed
out
the
party
was
not
allowed
really
to
attack
the
south
african
war
for
fear
it
should
alienate
asquith
it
was
not
allowed
to
object
to
herbert
gladstone
or
is
it
lord
gladstone
this
blaze
of
democracy
blinds
one
when
he
sought
to
abolish
the
habeas
corpus
act
and
leave
the
poorer
sort
of
pickpockets
permanently
at
the
caprice
of
their
jailers
parliament
is
busy
on
the
aristocratic
fads
and
mankind
must
mark
time
with
a
million
stamping
feet
while
herbert
samuel
searches
a
for
cigarettes
that
is
what
you
call
the
congestion
of
parliament
the
editor
of
the
was
so
rash
as
to
append
to
this
letter
the
words
we
must
be
stupid
for
we
have
no
idea
what
chesterton
means
this
was
too
good
an
opening
to
be
lost
returned
to
the
charge
and
i
feel
that
this
correspondence
is
so
important
in
various
ways
that
the
next
two
letters
should
be
given
in
full
sir
in
a
note
to
my
last
week
letter
you
remark
we
must
be
stupid
but
we
have
no
idea
what
chesterton
means
as
an
old
friend
i
can
assure
you
that
you
are
by
no
means
stupid
some
other
explanation
of
this
unnatural
darkness
must
be
found
and
i
find
it
in
the
effect
of
that
official
party
phraseology
which
i
attack
and
which
i
am
by
no
means
alone
in
attacking
if
i
had
talked
about
true
imperialism
or
our
loyalty
to
our
gallant
leader
you
might
have
thought
you
knew
what
i
meant
because
i
meant
nothing
but
i
do
mean
something
and
i
do
want
you
to
understand
what
i
mean
i
will
therefore
state
it
with
total
dullness
in
separate
paragraphs
and
i
will
number
them
i
say
a
democracy
means
a
state
where
the
citizens
first
desire
something
and
then
get
it
that
is
surely
simple
i
say
that
where
this
is
deflected
by
the
disadvantage
of
representation
it
means
that
the
citizens
desire
a
thing
and
tell
the
representatives
to
get
it
i
trust
i
make
myself
clear
the
representatives
in
order
to
get
it
at
all
must
have
some
control
over
detail
but
the
design
must
come
from
popular
desire
have
we
got
that
down
you
i
understand
hold
that
english
today
do
thus
obey
the
public
in
design
varying
only
in
detail
that
is
a
quite
clear
contention
i
say
they
do
tell
me
if
i
am
getting
too
abstruse
i
say
our
representatives
accept
designs
and
desires
almost
entirely
from
the
cabinet
class
above
them
and
practically
not
at
all
from
the
constituents
below
them
i
say
the
people
does
not
wield
a
parliament
which
wields
a
cabinet
i
say
the
cabinet
bullies
a
timid
parliament
which
bullies
a
bewildered
people
is
that
plain
if
you
ask
why
the
people
endure
and
play
this
game
i
say
they
play
it
as
they
would
play
the
official
games
of
any
despotism
or
aristocracy
the
average
englishman
puts
his
cross
on
a
as
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
the
king
and
would
take
it
off
if
there
were
no
there
is
no
democracy
in
the
business
is
that
definite
if
you
ask
why
we
have
thus
lost
democracy
i
say
from
two
causes
a
the
omnipotence
of
an
unelected
body
the
cabinet
b
the
party
system
which
turns
all
politics
into
a
game
like
the
boat
race
is
that
all
right
if
you
want
examples
i
could
give
you
scores
i
say
the
people
did
not
cry
out
that
all
children
whose
parents
lunch
on
cheese
and
beer
in
an
inn
should
be
left
out
in
the
rain
i
say
the
people
did
not
demand
that
a
man
sentence
should
be
settled
by
his
jailers
instead
of
by
his
judges
i
say
these
things
came
from
a
rich
group
not
only
without
any
evidence
but
really
without
any
pretence
that
they
were
popular
i
say
the
people
hardly
heard
of
them
at
the
polls
but
here
i
do
not
need
to
give
examples
but
merely
to
say
what
i
mean
surely
i
have
said
it
now
yours
chesterton
january
chesterton
is
precise
enough
now
but
he
is
precisely
wrong
there
are
grains
of
truth
in
his
premises
a
bushel
of
exaggeration
in
his
conclusions
we
have
not
lost
democracy
the
two
instances
which
he
alleges
both
of
which
we
dislike
are
too
small
to
prove
so
large
a
case
to
this
replied
sir
i
want
to
thank
you
for
printing
my
letters
and
especially
for
your
last
important
comment
in
which
you
say
that
the
crimes
and
children
acts
were
bad
but
are
too
small
to
support
a
charge
of
undemocracy
and
i
want
to
ask
you
one
last
question
which
is
the
question
why
do
you
think
of
these
things
as
small
they
are
really
enormous
one
alters
the
daily
habits
of
millions
of
people
the
other
destroys
the
public
law
of
thousands
of
years
what
can
be
more
fundamental
than
food
drink
and
children
what
can
be
more
catastrophic
than
putting
us
back
in
the
primal
anarchy
in
which
a
man
was
flung
into
a
dungeon
and
left
there
till
he
listened
to
reason
there
has
been
no
such
overturn
in
european
ethics
since
constantine
proclaimed
the
cross
why
do
you
think
of
these
things
as
small
i
will
tell
you
unconsciously
no
doubt
but
simply
and
solely
because
the
front
benches
did
not
announce
them
as
big
they
were
not
measures
they
were
not
debates
the
governing
class
got
them
through
in
the
quick
quiet
secondary
way
in
which
they
pass
things
that
the
people
positively
detests
not
in
the
pompous
lengthy
oratorical
way
in
which
they
present
measures
that
the
people
merely
bets
on
as
it
might
on
a
new
horse
a
measure
means
for
instance
tinkering
for
months
at
some
tottery
compromise
about
a
religious
education
that
does
exist
the
reason
is
simple
sound
church
teaching
and
dogmatic
christianity
both
happen
to
be
hobbies
in
the
class
from
which
cabinets
come
but
going
to
and
going
to
prison
are
both
habits
with
which
that
class
is
unfortunately
quite
unfamiliar
it
is
ready
therefore
at
a
stroke
of
the
pen
to
bring
all
folly
into
the
taverns
and
all
injustice
into
the
jails
yours
chesterton
february
it
was
not
only
in
the
that
such
letters
as
these
appeared
we
ca
write
in
every
paper
at
once
runs
a
letter
in
the
we
do
our
best
we
meant
gilbert
cecil
and
hilaire
belloc
and
goes
on
to
answer
four
questions
which
have
been
put
by
a
correspondent
signing
himself
political
journalist
first
in
whose
eyes
but
ours
has
the
party
system
lost
credit
i
say
in
nearly
everybody
if
this
were
a
free
country
i
could
mention
offhand
a
score
of
men
within
a
stone
throw
an
innkeeper
a
doctor
a
shopkeeper
a
lawyer
a
civil
servant
as
it
is
i
may
put
it
this
way
in
a
large
debating
society
i
proposed
to
attack
the
party
system
and
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
get
an
opposer
at
last
i
got
one
he
defended
the
party
system
on
the
ground
that
people
must
be
bamboozled
more
or
less
second
he
asks
if
the
party
system
does
not
govern
the
country
to
the
content
of
most
citizens
i
answer
that
englishmen
are
happy
under
the
party
system
solely
and
exactly
as
romans
were
happy
under
nero
that
is
not
because
government
was
good
but
because
life
is
good
even
without
good
government
nero
slaves
enjoyed
italy
not
nero
modern
englishmen
enjoy
england
but
certainly
not
the
british
constitution
the
legislation
is
detested
wherever
it
is
even
felt
the
other
day
a
cambridge
don
complained
that
when
out
bicycling
with
his
boys
he
had
to
leave
them
in
the
rain
while
he
drank
a
glass
of
cider
count
the
whole
series
of
human
souls
between
a
costermonger
and
a
cambridge
don
and
you
will
see
a
nation
in
mutiny
third
what
substitute
etc
here
again
the
answer
is
simple
and
indeed
traditional
i
suggest
we
should
do
what
was
always
suggested
in
the
riddles
and
revolutions
of
the
recent
centuries
in
the
seventeenth
century
phrase
i
suggest
that
we
should
call
a
free
parliament
fourth
is
democracy
compatible
with
parliamentary
government
god
forbid
is
god
compatible
with
church
government
why
should
he
be
it
is
the
other
things
that
have
to
be
compatible
with
god
a
church
can
only
be
a
humble
effort
to
utter
god
a
parliament
can
only
be
a
humble
effort
to
express
man
but
for
all
that
there
is
a
deal
of
commonsense
left
in
the
world
and
people
do
know
when
priests
or
politicians
are
honestly
trying
to
express
a
mystery
and
when
they
are
only
taking
advantage
of
an
ambiguity
chesterton
encouraged
by
the
excitement
that
had
attended
the
publication
of
party
its
authors
decided
to
attempt
a
newspaper
of
their
own
this
paper
is
still
in
existence
but
it
has
in
the
course
of
its
history
appeared
under
four
different
titles
to
avoid
later
confusion
i
had
better
set
these
down
at
the
outset
the
eye
witness
june
the
new
witness
november
weekly
the
weekly
review
till
today
during
the
first
year
of
its
existence
the
was
edited
by
belloc
cecil
chesterton
took
over
the
editorship
after
a
short
interregnum
during
which
he
was
assistant
editor
charles
granville
had
financed
it
when
he
went
bankrupt
the
title
was
altered
to
new
when
cecil
joined
the
army
in
became
editor
in
the
paper
died
but
two
years
later
rose
again
under
the
title
after
gilbert
own
death
belloc
took
it
back
today
as
weekly
it
is
edited
by
reginald
jebb
with
all
these
changes
of
name
the
continuity
of
the
paper
is
unmistakable
its
main
aim
may
be
roughly
defined
under
two
headings
to
fight
for
the
liberty
of
englishmen
against
increasing
enslavement
to
a
plutocracy
to
expose
and
combat
corruption
in
public
life
the
fight
for
liberty
appears
in
the
letters
quoted
above
in
the
form
of
an
attack
on
certain
bills
belloc
unified
and
defined
it
with
real
genius
in
the
articles
which
became
two
of
his
most
important
books
servile
and
restoration
of
if
these
two
books
be
set
beside
chesterton
wrong
with
the
and
outline
of
the
chesterbelloc
sociology
stands
complete
in
his
was
later
to
emphasise
the
genius
with
which
cobbett
saw
the
england
of
today
a
hundred
years
before
it
was
there
to
be
seen
belloc
in
the
same
way
saw
both
what
was
coming
and
the
way
in
which
it
was
coming
especially
was
his
attitude
to
lloyd
george
compulsory
health
insurance
act
it
was
the
first
act
of
the
kind
in
england
and
the
scheme
in
outline
was
every
week
every
employed
person
must
have
a
stamp
stuck
on
a
card
by
his
employer
of
which
he
paid
slightly
less
and
the
employer
slightly
more
than
half
the
cost
the
money
thus
saved
gave
the
insured
person
free
medical
treatment
and
a
certain
weekly
sum
during
the
period
of
illness
agricultural
labourers
were
omitted
from
the
act
and
a
ferment
raged
on
the
question
of
domestic
servants
who
were
eventually
included
in
its
operation
it
was
practically
acknowledged
that
this
was
done
to
make
the
act
more
workable
financially
for
domestic
servants
were
an
especially
healthy
class
and
moreover
in
most
upper
and
households
they
were
already
attended
by
the
family
doctor
without
cost
to
themselves
the
company
in
which
the
found
itself
in
opposing
this
act
was
indeed
a
case
of
strange
bedfellows
for
the
opposition
was
led
by
the
conservatives
on
the
ground
that
the
act
was
socialism
many
a
mistress
and
many
a
maid
did
i
hear
in
those
days
in
good
conservative
homes
declaring
they
would
rather
go
to
prison
than
lick
lloyd
george
stamps
most
liberals
on
the
other
hand
regarded
the
act
as
an
example
of
enlightened
legislation
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
the
saw
in
it
the
arrival
of
the
servile
state
their
main
objections
cut
deep
as
with
compulsory
education
but
in
much
more
fashion
this
act
took
away
the
liberty
and
the
personal
responsibilities
of
the
poor
and
in
doing
so
put
them
into
a
category
forever
ticketed
and
labelled
separated
from
the
other
part
of
the
nation
as
people
for
whom
everything
had
to
be
done
they
were
increasingly
at
the
mercy
of
their
employers
of
government
inspectors
of
philanthropic
societies
increasingly
slaves
what
was
meant
by
the
servile
state
it
was
said
belloc
an
arrangement
of
society
in
which
so
considerable
a
number
of
the
families
and
individuals
are
constrained
by
positive
law
to
labour
for
the
advantage
of
other
families
and
individuals
as
to
stamp
the
whole
community
with
the
mark
of
such
labour
it
was
quite
simply
the
return
of
slavery
as
the
condition
of
the
poor
and
the
chesterbelloc
did
not
think
then
or
ever
that
any
increase
of
comfort
or
security
was
a
sufficient
good
to
be
bought
at
the
price
of
liberty
in
a
section
of
the
paper
called
lex
versus
the
poor
the
editor
made
a
point
of
collecting
instances
of
oppression
a
series
of
articles
attacked
the
mentally
deficient
bill
whereby
poor
parents
could
have
their
children
taken
from
them
those
children
who
most
needed
them
and
whom
they
often
loved
and
clung
to
above
the
others
and
a
jewish
contributor
to
the
paper
eder
pointed
out
in
admirable
letters
how
divided
was
the
medical
profession
itself
on
what
constituted
mental
deficiency
and
whether
family
life
was
not
far
more
likely
to
develop
the
mind
than
segregation
with
other
deficients
in
an
institution
to
the
official
harriers
of
the
poor
were
added
further
inspectors
sent
by
such
societies
as
the
national
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
cruelty
to
children
as
gilbert
often
pointed
out
is
a
horrible
thing
but
very
seldom
proved
of
parents
against
their
own
children
the
word
was
stretched
to
cover
anything
that
these
inspectors
called
neglect
lately
we
have
read
of
a
case
and
many
like
it
were
reported
in
the
where
failure
to
wash
children
adequately
was
called
cruelty
and
what
was
the
remedy
to
take
away
the
father
the
breadwinner
to
prison
for
insufficient
food
and
clothes
to
substitute
destitution
for
insufficient
care
to
remove
the
only
one
the
children
had
to
care
for
them
at
all
always
to
break
up
the
family
worst
of
all
was
the
question
of
school
attendance
while
a
child
of
three
was
dying
of
starvation
the
mother
was
at
the
police
court
where
she
was
fined
for
not
sending
an
older
child
to
school
as
she
could
not
pay
the
fine
her
husband
was
sent
to
prison
for
a
week
a
child
died
of
consumption
the
parents
said
at
the
inquest
they
had
not
dared
to
keep
her
at
home
when
she
got
sick
for
fear
of
the
school
inspector
as
he
had
in
wrong
with
the
been
fired
by
the
thought
of
the
landless
poor
of
england
so
now
these
stories
stirred
gilbert
deeply
he
saw
the
philanthropists
like
the
pharisees
unheeding
the
wisdom
learned
by
the
wise
men
at
bethlehem
saw
them
with
their
busy
pencils
peering
at
the
mother
omissions
while
the
vast
crimes
of
the
state
went
unchallenged
he
wrote
a
poem
called
the
neglected
child
and
dedicated
in
a
glow
of
christian
charity
to
a
philanthropic
society
the
teachers
in
the
temple
they
did
not
lift
their
eyes
for
the
blazing
star
on
bethlehem
or
the
wise
men
grown
wise
they
heeded
jot
and
tittle
they
heeded
not
a
jot
the
rending
voice
in
ramah
and
the
children
that
were
not
or
how
the
panic
of
the
poor
choked
all
the
fields
with
flight
or
how
the
red
sword
of
the
rich
ran
ravening
through
the
night
they
made
their
notes
while
naked
and
monstrous
and
obscene
a
tyrant
bathed
in
all
the
blood
of
men
that
might
have
been
but
they
did
chide
our
lady
and
tax
her
for
this
thing
that
she
had
lost
him
for
a
time
and
sought
him
sorrowing
to
most
of
the
group
the
fight
for
freedom
was
so
bound
up
with
the
fight
against
corruption
that
all
was
but
one
fight
i
think
that
when
they
looked
back
they
were
too
much
inclined
to
see
the
shadow
of
lloyd
george
behind
them
as
well
as
around
them
that
in
fact
the
liberal
party
of
those
years
had
brought
with
it
a
new
descent
in
political
decency
a
descent
which
would
have
startled
both
gladstone
and
the
more
cynical
disraeli
of
this
more
when
we
come
to
marconi
meanwhile
there
was
certainly
a
whole
lot
to
fight
about
and
the
group
responsible
for
the
not
content
with
the
pen
formed
a
society
entitled
the
league
for
clean
government
with
john
scurr
as
secretary
this
league
specialised
in
promoting
the
candidature
of
independent
members
of
parliament
for
such
vacancies
as
occurred
between
general
elections
and
in
attacking
party
place
men
doubtless
other
elements
were
present
at
some
of
these
but
the
league
boasted
its
success
on
several
occasions
notably
in
the
three
defeats
sustained
by
masterman
charles
masterman
had
been
with
gilbert
and
cecil
chesterton
a
member
of
the
group
of
young
christian
socialists
that
drew
its
inspiration
in
great
part
from
canon
scott
holland
he
had
gone
further
than
most
of
them
in
his
practical
sympathy
and
understanding
for
the
destitute
with
a
friend
he
had
taken
a
workman
flat
in
the
slums
and
he
had
written
a
somewhat
florid
but
very
moving
book
recording
conditions
experienced
as
well
as
observed
he
was
one
of
the
young
liberals
who
entered
parliament
full
of
ardour
to
fight
the
battles
of
the
poor
the
sequel
as
they
saw
it
may
best
be
told
by
belloc
and
cecil
chesterton
themselves
in
party
they
wrote
masterman
entered
parliament
as
a
liberal
of
independent
views
during
his
first
two
years
in
the
house
he
distinguished
himself
as
a
critic
of
the
liberal
ministry
he
criticised
their
education
bill
he
criticised
with
especial
force
the
policy
of
john
burns
at
the
local
government
board
his
conduct
attracted
the
notice
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
he
was
offered
office
accepted
it
and
since
then
has
been
silent
except
for
an
occasional
rhetorical
exercise
in
defence
of
the
government
one
fact
will
be
sufficient
to
emphasise
the
change
on
march
masterman
voted
for
the
right
to
work
bill
of
the
labour
party
in
may
of
the
same
year
he
accepted
a
place
with
a
salary
of
a
year
it
has
since
risen
to
on
april
he
voted
at
the
bidding
of
the
party
whips
against
the
same
bill
which
he
had
voted
for
in
the
previous
year
yet
this
remarkable
example
of
the
peril
of
change
does
not
apparently
create
any
indignation
or
even
astonishment
in
the
political
world
which
masterman
adorns
on
the
contrary
he
seems
to
be
generally
regarded
as
a
politician
of
exceptionally
high
ideals
no
better
instance
need
be
recorded
of
the
peculiar
atmosphere
it
is
the
business
of
these
pages
to
describe
the
title
of
one
of
masterman
books
was
peril
of
at
the
succeeding
general
election
masterman
was
not
and
he
failed
again
in
a
couple
of
in
all
these
elections
the
league
for
clean
government
campaigned
fiercely
against
him
there
was
certainly
in
the
feeling
of
belloc
and
cecil
chesterton
towards
masterman
a
great
deal
of
the
bitterness
that
moved
browning
to
write
just
for
a
handful
of
silver
he
left
us
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
the
history
of
the
paper
that
created
so
strong
a
feeling
against
it
in
certain
minds
there
seemed
something
peculiarly
ungenerous
in
the
continued
attacks
after
a
series
of
defeats
in
the
insistence
with
which
masterman
name
was
dragged
in
always
accompanied
by
sneers
replying
to
a
remonstrance
to
this
effect
cecil
chesterton
then
editor
of
the
stated
that
in
his
considered
opinion
it
was
a
duty
to
make
a
successful
career
impossible
to
any
man
convicted
of
selling
his
principles
for
success
i
dwell
on
this
matter
of
masterman
for
two
reasons
the
first
is
that
it
was
one
of
the
rare
occasions
on
which
gilbert
chesterton
disagreed
with
his
brother
and
belloc
gilbert
was
a
very
faithful
friend
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
broken
friendship
in
his
life
he
had
moreover
much
of
the
power
that
aroused
his
enthusiasm
in
browning
of
going
into
the
depths
of
a
character
and
discovering
the
virtue
concealed
there
and
as
with
browning
his
explanation
took
account
of
elements
that
really
existed
but
could
find
no
place
in
a
more
narrowly
adverse
view
many
of
my
own
best
friends
he
wrote
of
masterman
entirely
misunderstood
and
underrated
him
it
is
true
that
as
he
rose
higher
in
politics
the
veil
of
the
politician
began
to
descend
a
little
on
him
also
but
he
became
a
politician
from
the
noblest
bitterness
on
behalf
of
the
poor
and
what
was
blamed
in
him
was
the
fault
of
much
more
ignoble
men
but
he
was
also
an
organiser
and
liked
governing
only
his
pessimism
made
him
think
that
government
had
always
been
bad
and
was
now
no
worse
than
usual
therefore
to
men
on
fire
for
reform
he
came
to
seem
an
obstacle
and
an
official
apologist
after
became
editor
of
the
the
attacks
on
masterman
ceased
but
he
did
not
differ
from
the
two
earlier
editors
in
his
views
on
the
ethics
of
political
action
or
the
principles
of
social
reform
the
second
reason
for
which
the
masterman
matter
must
be
dwelt
on
is
because
it
affords
the
best
illustration
of
one
curious
fact
in
connection
with
the
and
campaign
when
the
of
recently
appeared
i
seized
it
eagerly
that
i
might
read
an
authoritative
defence
of
his
position
i
searched
the
index
under
witness
new
witness
cecil
and
for
clean
no
one
of
them
was
mentioned
at
last
i
discovered
under
and
a
faint
allusion
to
their
activities
at
a
in
which
belloc
was
coupled
with
the
protestant
alliance
leader
kensit
as
part
of
a
contemptible
opposition
and
the
unnamed
league
for
clean
government
described
as
those
working
with
scurr
clearly
where
it
is
possible
to
use
against
something
powerful
the
weapon
of
ignoring
it
as
though
it
were
something
obscure
that
weapon
is
itself
a
powerful
one
against
the
it
was
used
perpetually
a
paper
which
included
among
its
contributors
hilaire

chesterton
phillimore
bentley

own

hugh
picturesque

years
the
high
level
of
the
reviewing
and
oddly
enough
considering
the
paper
outlook
the
financial
articles
of
raymond
radclyffe
were
all
outstanding
the
sales
at
sixpence
were
never
enormous
but
the
readers
were
on
a
high
cultural
level
the
correspondence
pages
are
always
interesting
the
group
besides
courage
had
high
spirits
and
they
had
wit
capulet
rhymes
the
series
of

written
by

there
was
little
of
this
quality
in
the
other
weeklies
side
by
side
with
the
serious
attacks
was
a
line
of
satire
and
of
sheer
fooling
the
silver
deal
in
india
was
being
attacked
in
the
editorials
while
markham
explained
to
tommy
how
good
kind
lord
swaythling
really
a
samuel
had
lent
money
to
his
brother
montague
another
samuel
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
people
of
india
the
next
week
tommy
and
rachel
grew
enthusiastic
about
the
kindness
of
lord
swaythling
in
money
that
the
indian
government
could
not
use
markham
too
made
rachel
take
a
pencil
and
write
out
a
list
of
samuels
including
the
now
so
busy
over
the
marconi
case
the
next
lesson
was
about
titles
then
came
one
about
policemen
and
finally
about
company
promoters
and
investments
how
a
promoter
guesses
there
is
oil
somewhere
how
money
is
lent
to
dig
for
it
but
mamma
how
can
money
dig
how
the
company
promoter
may
find
no
oil
how
if
they
think
he
has
cheated
them
the
rich
men
who
lent
their
money
can
have
him
tried
by
twelve
good
men
and
true
how
do
they
know
the
men
are
good
and
true
mamma
they
do
this
by
taking
them
in
alphabetical
order
out
of
a
perhaps
the
combination
of
irony
thinly
veiling
intensity
of
purpose
with
humour
sometimes
degenerating
into
wild
fooling
damned
them
in
the
eyes
of
many
but
there
was
a
more
serious
obstacle
to
the
real
effectiveness
they
might
otherwise
have
had
when
it
was
unavoidable
to
name
the
its
opponents
referred
to
it
as
though
to
a
rag
why
was
this
possible
principally
i
think
because
of
the
violence
of
its
language
most
parliamentary
matters
to
which
it
made
reference
were
spoken
of
as
instances
of
foul
corruption
or
dirty
business
transactions
by
ministers
were
said
to
stink
while
the

themselves
were

chapter
xix
marconi
in
his
gilbert
chesterton
has
set
down
his
belief
that
the
marconi
scandal
will
be
seen
by
historians
as
a
landmark
in
english
history
to
him
personally
the
revelations
produced
by
it
were
a
great
shock
and
gave
the
to
all
that
still
lingered
of
his
belief
in
the
liberal
party
for
the
rest
of
his
life
it
may
almost
be
called
an
obsession
with
him
in
his
eyes
it
was
so
great
a
landmark
that
as
others
spoke
of
events
as
or
he
divided
the
political
history
of
england
into
and
it
meant
as
much
for
his
political
outlook
as
the
enclosures
for
his
social
it
is
necessary
to
know
what
happened
in
the
marconi
case
if
we
are
to
understand
a
most
important
element
in
chesterton
mental
history
the
difficulty
is
to
know
what
did
happen
the
main
lines
of
a
very
complicated
bit
of
history
have
never
so
far
as
i
know
been
disentangled
by
anyone
whose
only
interest
was
to
disentangle
them
and
the
partisans
have
naturally
tangled
them
more
i
wrote
a
draft
chapter
after
reading
the
two
thousand
page
report
of
the
parliamentary
committee
the
six
hundred
page
report
of
cecil
chesterton
trial
and
masses
of
contemporary
journalism
then
in
the
circumstances
i
have
related
in
the
introduction
i
called
in
my
husband
aid
the
rest
of
this
chapter
is
mainly
his
i
what
the
ministers
did
the
imperial
conference
of
had
approved
the
plan
of
a
chain
of
wireless
stations
to
be
erected
throughout
the
british
empire
the
post
office
herbert
samuel
being
the
was
instructed
to
put
the
matter
in
hand
after
consideration
of
competing
systems
the
marconi
was
chosen
the
marconi
wireless
telegraph
of
london
of
which
godfrey
isaacs
was
managing
director
was
asked
to
tender
for
the
work
its
tender
was
accepted
on
march
the
main
terms
of
the
tender
were
as
follows
the
company
was
to
erect
stations
in
various
parts
of
the
empire
at
a
cost
to
the
government
of
per
station
these
were
then
to
be
operated
by
the
governments
of
the
united
kingdom
and
the
dominions
and
colonies
concerned
and
the
marconi
company
was
to
receive
of
the
gross
receipts
the
agreement
was
for
years
though
the
might
terminate
it
at
the
end
of
eighteen
years
but
there
was
one
further
clause
clause
allowing
for
termination
any
if
the
government
should
find
it
advantageous
to
use
a
different
system
the
acceptance
of
this
tender
was
only
the
first
stage
a
contract
had
to
be
drawn
up
and
nothing
would
be
finalised
till
this
contract
had
been
accepted
by
parliament
in
fact
the
contract
was
not
completed
till
july
on
that
day
it
was
placed
on
the
table
of
the
house
of
commons
for
the
understanding
of
the
marconi
case
the
vital
period
is
the
four
months
of
between
march
when
the
tender
was
accepted
and
july
when
the
contract
was
tabled
let
us
concentrate
upon
that
period
the
issued
no
statement
whatever
on
the
matter
but
on
march
the
company
sent
out
a
circular
to
its
shareholders
telling
them
the
good
news
but
making
the
news
look
even
better
than
it
was
by
omitting
all
reference
to
clause
which
entitled
the
government
to
substitute
some
rival
system
at
any
time
it
pleased
the
issued
no
correction
because
as
he
said
later
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
omission
immediately
after
godfrey
isaacs
left
for
america
to
consider
the
affairs
of
the
american
marconi
company
capitalised
at
of
which
he
was
a
director
more
than
half
its
shares
were
owned
by
the
english
company
on
behalf
of
the
english
company
he
bought
up
the
rights
of
the
american
company
principal
rival
and
then
sold
these
rights
at
a
profit
not
stated
but
apparently
very
considerable
to
the
american
company
for
to
handle
all
this
and
allow
for
vast
developments
hoped
for
from
this
purchase
and
from
a
very
favourable
agreement
godfrey
isaacs
had
negotiated
with
western
union
the
american
company
was
to
be
as
a
company
two
million
shares
at
each
the
american
company
whose
own
repute
in
america
was
too
low
for
any
hope
of
raising
money
on
that
scale
from
the
american
public
seems
to
have
agreed
to
the
godfrey
isaacs
plan
only
on
condition
that
the
english
company
should
guarantee
the
subscription
and
godfrey
isaacs
made
himself
personally
responsible
for
placing
shares
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
pound
was
then
worth
just
under
five
dollars
a
share
was
worth
or
in
english
money
godfrey
isaacs
returned
to
england
on
april
he
lunched
with
his
brothers
harry
and
rufus
rufus
being
in
the
british
government
he
told
them
of
the
arrangements
he
had
made
arrangements
which
were
not
yet
made
known
to
the
public
and
of
the
new
stock
about
to
be
issued
and
offered
them
shares
out
of
the
for
which
he
had
made
himself
responsible
at
the
face
value
of
rufus
refused
one
reason
for
his
refusal
being
that
the
shares
were
not
a
good
buy
as
the
prospects
of
the
company
did
not
warrant
so
large
a
new
issue
of
capital
harry
took
we
now
come
to
the
transactions
which
the
public
was
later
to
lump
together
rather
crudely
as
ministers
gambling
in
marconis
a
on
april
roughly
a
week
after
the
luncheon
rufus
isaacs
bought
of
harry
shares
at
he
made
the
point
later
that
buying
from
godfrey
would
have
been
improper
as
godfrey
was
director
of
a
company
with
which
the
government
was
negotiating
but
that
it
was
all
right
to
buy
from
harry
who
had
bought
from
godfrey
harry
having
paid
only
was
willing
to
let
rufus
have
them
for
the
same
price
but
rufus
thought
it
only
fair
to
pay
the
higher
price
this
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
only
a
week
earlier
he
had
thought
these
same
shares
bad
value
at
roughly
half
the
price
he
was
now
prepared
to
pay
of
his
shares
rufus
immediately
sold
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
david
lloyd
george
and
to
the
master
of
elibank
who
was
chief
whip
of
the
liberal
party
then
in
office
it
is
to
be
noted
that
no
money
passed
at
this
time
in
any
of
those
transactions
rufus
did
not
pay
harry
lloyd
george
and
elibank
did
not
pay
rufus
nor
did
the
shares
pass
indeed
the
shares
did
not
as
yet
exist
as
it
was
not
till
the
next
day
april
that
the
american
marconi
company
authorised
the
issue
of
the
new
capital
on
the
day
after
that
april
the
shares
were
put
on
the
market
at
that
same
day
they
rose
to
in
the
course
of
the
day
rufus
isaacs
sold
shares
at
an
average
price
of
which
on
the
face
of
it
looks
like
clearing
more
than
he
had
paid
for
all
his
shares
and
still
having
shares
left
but
he
explained
later
that
there
had
been
pooling
arrangements
between
himself
and
his
brother
and
himself
and
his
two
friends
so
that
the
upshot
of
his
transactions
was
that
he
had
sold
of
his
own
shares
and
each
for
lloyd
george
and
elibank
the
triumvirate
therefore
still
had
shares
of
which
belonged
to
lloyd
george
and
elibank
rufus
explanation
boils
down
to
this
he
and
harry
had
arranged
that
whatever
either
sold
in
the
course
of
the
day
should
be
totalled
and
divided
in
the
proportion
of
their
holdings
rufus
sold
shares
harry
a
total
of
rufus
had
taken
of
harry
shares
so
of
the
shares
sold
were
allotted
as
his
lloyd
george
and
elibank
had
each
taken
of
rufus
therefore
each
was
considered
to
have
sold
on
april
these
two
sold
a
further
of
their
shares
at
b
on
may
lloyd
george
and
elibank
bought
more
shares
at
as
they
were
not
due
to
deliver
the
shares
previously
sold
by
them
at
and
till
june
this
new
purchase
had
something
of
the
look
of
a
bear
transaction
in
april
and
may
the
master
of
elibank
bought
shares
for
the
account
of
the
liberal
party
of
whose
funds
he
had
charge
these
three
transactions
are
all
that
the
three
politicians
ever
admitted
and
nothing
more
was
ever
proved
against
them
as
we
have
seen
there
was
no
documentary
evidence
of
the
principal
transaction
the
one
i
have
called
a
except
that
rufus
sold
shares
on
april
in
his
acquiring
of
the
shares
no
broker
was
employed
rufus
did
not
pay
harry
for
the
shares
until
january
some
nine
months
later
when
the
enquiry
was
already
on
there
was
no
evidence
other
than
his
own
word
that
was
the
number
he
had
agreed
to
take
or
the
price
that
he
had
agreed
to
pay
or
that
he
had
bought
from
harry
and
not
from
godfrey
or
that
of
the
shares
he
had
certainly
sold
at
a
huge
profit
on
april
half
were
sold
for
harry
there
was
indeed
no
evidence
that
the
shares
were
not
a
gift
even
on
what
they
admitted
they
had
obviously
acted
improperly
the
contract
with
the
english
marconi
company
was
not
yet
completed
parliament
had
not
been
informed
of
its
terms
parliament
therefore
had
yet
to
decide
whether
it
would
accept
or
reject
it
three
members
of
parliament
had
committed
two
grave
improprieties
they
had
purchased
shares
directly
or
at
one
remove
from
the
managing
director
of
a
company
seeking
a
contract
from
parliament
in
circumstances
that
were
practically
equivalent
to
receiving
a
gift
of
money
from
him
they
received
shares
which
the
general
public
could
not
have
bought
till
two
days
later
and
then
only
at
over
more
than
the
politicians
paid
on
this
count
the
fact
that
the
shares
were
american
marconis
made
no
difference
the
point
is
that
they
were
valuable
shares
sold
to
ministers
at
a
special
low
price
this
need
not
have
been
bribery
but
it
is
a
fact
that
one
way
of
bribing
a
man
is
to
buy
something
from
him
at
more
than
it
is
worth
or
sell
something
to
him
at
less
than
it
is
worth
campbell
of
bullett
campbell
grenfell
the
english
marconi
company
official
brokers
gave
evidence
before
the
parliamentary
committee
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
general
public
to
buy
the
shares
before
april
and
as
we
have
seen
they
opened
on
that
day
at
they
and
through
the
chief
whip
action
the
whole
liberal
party
though
it
did
not
know
it
were
financially
interested
in
the
acceptance
by
parliament
of
the
contract
for
though
they
had
not
bought
shares
in
the
english
company
with
which
the
contract
was
being
made
but
with
the
american
company
which
had
no
direct
interest
in
the
contract
none
the
less
it
would
have
lowered
the
value
of
the
american
shares
if
the
british
parliament
had
rejected
the
marconi
system
and
chosen
some
other
in
preference
i
may
say
at
once
that
i
feel
no
certainty
that
the
transaction
was
a
sinister
effort
to
bribe
ministers
but
had
it
been
exactly
the
right
ministers
were
chosen
they
were
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
who
has
charge
of
the
nation
purse
the
who
advises
upon
the
legality
of
actions
proposed
the
chief
whip
who
takes
the
party
forces
into
the
voting
lobby
it
was
this
same
chief
whip
the
master
of
elibank
that
had
carried
the
sale
of
honours
to
a
new
height
in
his
devotion
to
the
increase
of
his
party
funds
ii
the
parliamentary
enquiry
on
july
the
contract
was
put
on
the
table
of
the
house
of
commons
in
the
ordinary
course
it
would
have
come
up
for
a
vote
some
time
before
the
end
of
the
parliamentary
session
but
criticism
of
the
contract
was
growing
on
the
ground
that
it
was
too
favourable
to
the
marconi
company
and
rumours
were
flying
that
members
of
the
government
had
been
gambling
in
marconi
shares
which
as
we
have
seen
they
had
though
not
in
english
marconis
even
before
the
tabling
of
the
contract
members
of
parliament
notably
major
a
conservative
had
been
harrying
herbert
samuel
the
on
july
and
in
weekly
articles
following
it
was
attacked
as
a
thoroughly
bad
contract
by
a
writer
in
the
lawson
on
august
a
labour
member
asked
a
question
in
the
house
about
the
rising
price
of
marconis
the
feeling
that
enquiry
was
needed
was
so
strong
that
on
august
the
last
day
but
one
of
the
session
the
prime
minister
who
knew
something
of
his
colleagues
purchase
of
marconis
but
never
mentioned
it
promised
the
house
that
the
marconi
agreement
would
not
be
rushed
through
without
full
discussion
in
spite
of
this
herbert
and
elibank
both
tried
hard
to
get
the
contract
approved
that
day
or
the
next
when
it
was
quite
clear
that
parliament
would
not
allow
this
herbert
samuel
insisted
on
making
a
general
statement
on
the
contract
he
too
knew
of
the
ministers
dealings
in
american
marconis
but
did
not
mention
them
there
was
no
debate
or
division
the
question
of
ratification
or
rejection
was
postponed
till
the
house
should
meet
again
in
october
the
argument
he
put
to
major
was
that
the
stations
were
urgently
needed
for
imperial
defence
on
august
cecil
chesterton
paper
the
launched
its
first
attack
on
the
whole
deal
though
without
reference
to
ministerial
gambling
in
marconis
under
the
headline
the
marconi
scandal
isaacs
brother
is
chairman
of
the
marconi
company
it
has
therefore
been
secretly
arranged
between
isaacs
and
samuel
that
the
british
people
shall
give
the
marconi
company
a
very
large
sum
of
money
through
the
agency
of
the
said
samuel
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
said
isaacs
incidentally
the
monopoly
that
is
about
to
be
granted
to
isaacs
no
through
the
ardent
charity
of
isaacs
no
and
his
colleague
the
is
a
monopoly
involving
antiquated
methods
the
refusal
of
competing
tenders
far
cheaper
and
far
more
efficient
and
the
saddling
of
this
country
with
corruptly
purchased
goods
which
happen
to
be
inferior
goods
the
article
went
on
to
say
that
these
swindles
were
apt
to
occur
in
any
country
but
that
england
alone
lacked
the
will
to
punish
them
it
is
the
lack
of
even
a
minimum
standard
of
honour
urging
even
honest
men
to
protest
against
such
villainy
that
has
brought
us
where
we
are
in
september
maxse
had
a
criticism
of
the
contract
by
major
with
editorial
comment
as
well
in
the
same
month
the
and
the
pressed
for
further
enquiry
the
october
number
of
the
contained
a
searching
criticism
of
the
whole
business
and
called
special
attention
to
the
stock
exchange
gamble
in
american
marconis
a
few
days
later
on
october
the
house
of
commons
held
the
promised
debate
in
the
light
of
what
we
know
it
is
fascinating
to
read
how
nobody
told
a
lie
exactly
and
the
truth
was
concealed
all
the
same
here
is
sir
rufus
isaacs
he
begins
by
formulating
the
rumours
against
herbert
samuel
and
lloyd
george
and
himself
but
he
is
careful
to
formulate
them
in
such
a
way
that
he
can
truthfully
deny
them
the
rumours
he
says
were
that
the
ministers
had
dealt
in
the
shares
of
a
company
with
which
the
government
was
negotiating
a
contract
never
from
the
beginning
have
i
had
one
single
transaction
with
the
shares
of
that
company
literally
true
as
you
see
the
contract
was
with
the
english
company
the
shares
he
had
bought
were
in
the
american
company
he
made
no
allusion
to
that
purchase
herbert
samuel
who
is
not
accused
of
having
purchased
shares
himself
but
who
knew
of
what
his
colleagues
had
done
treads
the
same
careful
line
i
say
that
these
stories
that
members
of
the
cabinet
knowing
the
contract
was
in
contemplation
and
feeling
that
possibly
the
price
of
shares
might
rise
themselves
directly
or
indirectly
bought
any
of
those
shares
or
took
any
interest
in
this
company
through
any
other
party
whatever
have
not
one
syllable
of
truth
in
them
neither
i
myself
nor
any
of
my
colleagues
have
at
any
time
held
one
shilling
worth
of
shares
in
this
company
directly
or
indirectly
or
have
derived
one
penny
profit
from
the
fluctuations
in
their
prices
however
he
promised
a
parliamentary
committee
to
enquire
into
the
whole
affair
isaacs
had
denied
any
transactions
with
that
company
samuel
with
this
company
neither
had
ventured
to
say
the
english
company
for
that
would
instantly
have
raised
the
question
of
the
american
company
it
is
an
odd
truth
that
has
to
be
phrased
so
delicately
lloyd
george
the
first
of
the
ministers
to
speak
managed
better
he
flew
into
a
rage
with
an
interjector
the
hon
member
said
something
about
the
government
and
he
has
talked
about
i
want
to
know
what
these
rumours
are
if
the
hon
gentleman
has
any
charge
to
make
against
the
government
as
a
whole
or
against
individual
members
of
it
i
think
it
ought
to
be
stated
openly
the
reason
why
the
government
wanted
frank
discussion
before
going
to
was
because
we
wanted
to
bring
here
these
rumours
these
sinister
rumours
that
have
been
passing
from
one
foul
lip
to
another
behind
the
backs
of
the
house
he
sat
down
still
in
a
white
heat
without
having
denied
anything
italics
mine
the
master
of
elibank
did
not
deny
anything
either
he
was
not
there
he
was
indeed
no
longer
in
the
house
of
commons
he
had
inherited
the
title
of
lord
murray
of
elibank
he
had
left
england
in
august
and
did
not
return
till
the
enquiry
was
over
nor
did
he
send
any
communication
of
any
sort
as
we
have
seen
no
literal
lie
was
told
but
parliament
and
the
country
assumed
that
the
ministers
had
denied
any
gambling
in
marconis
of
any
sort
and
the
ministers
must
have
known
that
this
was
what
their
denials
had
been
taken
to
mean
rufus
isaacs
son
mentions
a
theory
held
by
some
though
he
thinks
there
are
strong
arguments
against
it
that
rufus
silence
was
due
to
instructions
from
the
prime
minister
asquith
who
was
not
anxious
to
have
the
connection
of
lloyd
george
with
the
matter
disclosed
fearing
that
his
personal
unpopularity
would
lead
to
such
an
exacerbation
of
the
attacks
that
the
prestige
of
the
whole
government
might
be
seriously
impaired
isaacs
first
marquess
of
pp
on
october
the
names
were
announced
of
the
members
appointed
to
the
promised
committee
of
enquiry
as
usual
they
represented
the
various
parties
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
in
the
house
the
liberals
were
in
office
supported
by
irish
nationalists
and
labour
members
members
of
the
committee
including
the
chairman
were
from
these
parties
were
conservatives
one
might
have
expected
that
the
careful
evasions
in
the
house
would
have
meant
only
a
brief
respite
for
the
ministers
who
had
been
so
economical
of
the
truth
they
would
appear
before
the
committee
and
then
the
whole
thing
would
emerge
but
though
the
committee
was
appointed
at
the
end
of
october
and
met
three
times
most
weeks
thereafter
five
months
went
by
and
no
minister
was
called
the
plain
fact
is
that
samuel
department
the
post
office
slanted
the
enquiry
in
a
different
direction
right
at
the
start
by
putting
in
evidence
a
confidential
blue
book
and
suggesting
that
sir
alexander
king
secretary
to
the
post
office
be
heard
first
on
the
question
of
the
goodness
or
badness
of
the
contract
itself
the
committee
uncovered
much
that
was
interesting
it
emerged
that
the
poulsen
system
had
offered
to
erect
stations
at
a
cost
of
about
less
per
station
than
the
marconi
and
that
the
admiralty
itself
had
estimated
a
cost
if
they
were
undertaking
the
work
about
the
same
as
the
poulsen
offer
but
by
a
confusion
as
to
whether
their
figure
did
or
did
not
include
freight
charges
the
admiralty
estimate
had
been
put
down
at
higher
than
it
was
nor
was
this
the
only
confusion
when
sir
alexander
king
spoke
of
concessions
made
to
the
government
by
the
marconi
company
he
admitted
under
that
there
was
no
written
record
of
these
concessions
he
spoke
of
various
vitally
important
conversations
and
was
not
able
to
produce
a
minute
letters
referred
to
were
found
to
have
been
lost
from
the
post
office
files
further
it
appeared
that
while
most
rigid
tests
were
to
be
required
of
the
other
systems
the
marconi
people
had
been
constantly
taken
almost
on
their
own
word
alone
isaacs
and
marconi
both
told
us
said
sir
alexander
king
at
one
point
when
asked
whether
he
had
had
technical
advice
on
a
point
of
working
you
will
excuse
me
said
harold
smith
if
for
the
moment
i
ignore
the
opinion
of
marconi
and
isaacs
i
ask
you
who
was
the
expert
who
gave
you
this
information
then
too
as
to
the
terms
the
government
had
proposed
on
the
gross
takings
godfrey
isaacs
had
held
out
for
and
got
it
moreover
the
royalty
was
to
be
paid
as
long
as
a
single
marconi
patent
was
in
use
at
the
stations
considering
that
by
the
patents
act
the
government
had
the
legal
right
to
take
over
invention
while
paying
reasonable
compensation
the
provision
which
gave
so
high
a
royalty
to
the
marconi
company
was
severely
criticised
again
the
right
was
given
to
the
marconi
company
to
advise
on
any
fresh
invention
that
should
be
offered
to
the
post
office
which
meant
that
any
invention
made
by
their
rivals
was
entirely
at
their
mercy
naturally
enough
the
question
was
pressed
home
whether
the
post
office
had
really
sought
the
advice
of
its
own
technical
experts
it
transpired
that
a
technical
had
been
called
once
and
had
recommended
a
further
investigation
of
the
poulsen
system
the
report
of
this
had
been
shelved
and
the
members
never
summoned
for
a
second
meeting
early
in
january
the
parliamentary
committee
against
the
advice
of
herbert
samuel
asked
for
a
special
of
experts
to
go
into
the
merits
of
the
various
wireless
systems
and
report
within
three
months
at
latest
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
commented
on
this
as
a
surrender
of
the
most
decided
type
for
it
proposes
to
do
what
samuel
himself
clearly
ought
to
have
done
before
he
entered
into
the
contract
the
report
of
this
technical
showed
that
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
exaggeration
in
the
first
attack
by
the
on
the
worth
of
the
marconi
system
if
one
single
system
was
to
be
used
it
was
the
only
one
capable
of
carrying
out
the
requirements
but
the
held
that
as
wireless
was
in
a
state
of
rapid
development
it
would
be
better
not
to
be
tied
to
any
one
system
and
they
added
that
while
the
nature
of
the
contract
itself
was
not
within
their
terms
of
reference
they
must
not
be
held
to
approve
it
from
its
examination
of
the
contract
the
committee
passed
on
to
examine
journalists
and
others
as
to
the
rumours
against
ministers
and
still
the
ministers
were
not
called
on
february
maxse
editor
of
national
was
being
examined
by
the
committee
suddenly
he
put
his
finger
on
the
precise
spot
having
expressed
surprise
at
the
of
ministers
he
went
on
one
might
have
conceived
that
they
would
have
appeared
at
its
first
sitting
clamoring
to
state
in
the
most
categorical
and
emphatic
manner
that
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
in
their
own
names
or
in
other
people
names
have
they
had
any
transactions
whatsoever
either
in
london
dublin
new
york
brussels
amsterdam
paris
or
any
other
financial
centre
in
any
shares
in
any
marconi
company
throughout
the
negotiations
with
the
government
any
shares
in
any
marconi
company
the
direct
question
was
at
last
put
on
february
just
two
days
later
something
very
curious
happened
a
paris
daily
paper
published
a
story
to
the
effect
that
maxse
had
charged
that
samuel
rufus
isaacs
and
godfrey
isaacs
had
bought
shares
in
the
english
marconi
company
at
francs
about
in
those
days
before
the
negotiations
with
the
government
were
started
and
had
resold
them
at
francs
about
when
the
public
learnt
that
the
contract
was
going
through
it
was
an
extraordinary
piece
of
clumsiness
for
any
paper
to
have
printed
such
a
story
certainly
maxse
had
made
no
such
charge
it
was
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
luck
if
the
ministers
wanted
to
tell
their
story
in
court
that
they
should
have
this
kind
of
clumsy
libel
to
deny
and
it
is
at
least
a
coincidence
that
rufus
isaacs
happened
as
his
son
tells
us
to
be
in
paris
when
printed
the
story
samuel
and
rufus
isaacs
announced
that
they
would
prosecute
and
that
sir
edward
carson
and
smith
were
their
counsel
this
decision
to
prosecute
a
not
very
important
french
newspaper
while
taking
no
such
step
against
papers
in
their
own
country
caused
gilbert
chesterton
to
write
a
song
of
cosmopolitan
courage
vol
i
p
i
am
so
swift
to
seize
affronts
my
spirit
is
so
high
whoever
has
insulted
me
some
foreigner
must
die
i
brought
a
libel
action
for
the
times
had
called
me
thief
against
a
paper
in
bordeaux
a
paper
called
called
me
cannibal
i
could
not
let
it
pass
i
got
a
retractation
from
a
journal
in
alsace
and
when
morning
raked
up
some
murders
i
devised
a
polish
organ
of
finance
at
once
apologised
i
know
the
charges
varied
much
at
times
i
am
afraid
frankfurt
withdrew
a
charge
the
had
not
made
and
what
the
true
injustice
of
the
words
had
been
was
not
correctly
altered
in
the
turk
i
know
it
sounds
confusing
but
as
lammle
said
the
anger
of
a
gentleman
is
boiling
in
my
head
the
hearing
of
the
case
against
came
on
march
as
that
paper
had
withdrawn
and
apologised
only
three
days
after
printing
the
story
there
was
no
actual
necessity
for
statements
by
rufus
isaacs
and
samuel
but
they
had
decided
to
answer
maxse
question
to
admit
the
dealings
in
american
marconis
which
they
had
not
mentioned
to
the
house
of
commons
or
rather
to
get
their
lawyer
to
tell
the
story
and
then
answer
his
questions
on
the
matter
in
a
court
case
where
there
could
be
no
because
the
defendants
were
not
contesting
the
case
sir
edward
carson
mentioned
the
american
purchase
at
the
end
of
a
long
speech
and
almost
as
an
afterthought
really
the
matter
is
so
removed
from
the
charges
made
in
the
libel
that
i
only
go
into
it
at
all
because
of
the
position
of
the
and
because
he
wishes
in
the
fullest
way
to
state
this
deal
so
that
it
may
not
be
said
that
he
keeps
anything
whatsoever
back
as
remarked
june
the
fact
was
stated
casually
as
though
it
had
been
a
matter
at
once
trifling
and
irrelevant
only
persons
of
the
most
scrupulous
honour
who
desired
that
nothing
whatsoever
should
remain
hid
would
it
was
suggested
have
thought
necessary
to
mention
it
at
all
the
statement
was
not
really
as
full
as
carson
phrasing
would
seem
to
suggest
the
court
was
told
that
rufus
isaacs
had
bought
shares
but
not
from
whom
he
had
bought
them
that
he
had
paid
market
price
but
not
what
the
price
was
nor
that
the
shares
were
not
on
the
market
that
he
had
sold
shares
each
to
lloyd
george
and
elibank
and
had
sold
some
on
their
behalf
but
not
that
these
two
had
had
further
buyings
and
sellings
on
their
own
it
was
stated
for
sir
rufus
and
reiterated
by
him
that
he
had
lost
money
on
the
deal
the
reason
being
that
while
he
had
gained
on
the
shares
sold
the
shares
he
still
held
had
slumped
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
rufus
isaacs
and
later
lloyd
george
made
such
a
point
of
the
loss
on
their
marconi
transactions
they
can
hardly
have
bought
the
shares
in
order
to
lose
money
on
them
and
their
initial
sellings
showed
a
very
large
profit
indeed
rufus
isaacs
loss
depended
on
his
having
paid
his
brother
for
the
shares
and
again
upon
the
shares
he
sold
on
the
opening
day
being
only
partly
on
his
own
behalf
and
there
is
only
his
own
word
for
these
two
statements
if
rufus
lost
he
lost
to
his
brother
who
had
been
willing
to
sell
at
cost
price
with
whom
he
had
a
pooling
arrangement
and
who
made
an
enormous
profit
if
rufus
lost
the
loss
remained
in
the
family
a
week
after
the
hearing
of
the
case
rufus
isaacs
appeared
for
the
first
time
before
the
parliamentary
committee
almost
five
months
after
its
formation
his
problem
was
not
so
much
to
explain
his
dealings
in
american
marconis
as
to
account
for
his
silence
in
the
house
of
commons
his
one
desire
that
day
in
parliament
it
seems
had
been
to
answer
the
foul
lies
being
uttered
against
him
which
he
was
quite
unable
to
find
any
foundation
for
quite
unable
to
trace
the
source
of
quite
unable
to
understand
how
they
were
started
obviously
his
dealings
in
american
marconis
could
have
no
possible
bearing
on
these
rumours
so
he
did
not
mention
them
i
confined
my
speech
entirely
to
dealing
with
the
four
specific
charges
i
formulated
italics
mine
the
chairman
sir
albert
spicer
suggested
that
one
way
to
scotch
the
rumours
would
have
been
to
mention
his
investment
in
american
marconis
because
both
being
marconis
you
could
easily
understand
one
might
get
confused
with
the
other
this
question
always
drove
rufus
isaacs
into
a
rage
and
indeed
he
met
all
difficult
questions
with
rages
which
to
this
day
across
the
gulf
of
thirty
years
seem
simulated
and
not
convincingly
why
had
he
not
earlier
asked
the
committee
to
hear
the
story
of
the
american
shares
i
took
the
view
that
i
had
no
right
to
claim
any
preferential
position
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
might
almost
savour
of
presumption
if
i
had
asked
the
committee
to
take
my
evidence
or
any
minister
evidence
out
of
the
ordinary
turn
in
which
the
committee
desired
it
all
the
same
he
had
once
written
a
letter
to
the
committee
asking
to
be
heard
but
on
consideration
did
not
send
it
during
his
examination
the
element
of
strain
between
the
two
parties
on
the
committee
which
had
been
evident
throughout
the
enquiry
was
very
much
intensified
lord
robert
cecil
and
the
conservatives
courteously
but
tenaciously
trying
to
get
at
the
truth
the
ministerialists
determined
to
shield
their
man
there
is
a
most
unpleasing
contrast
between
the
earlier
bullying
of
the
journalists
who
after
all
were
not
on
trial
and
the
deference
the
majority
now
showed
to
ministers
who
were
rufus
isaacs
twisted
and
turned
incredibly
but
he
did
admit
to
lord
robert
cecil
that
he
had
obtained
the
shares
before
they
were
available
to
the
general
public
and
at
a
price
lower
than
that
at
which
they
were
afterwards
introduced
to
them
he
tried
later
to
modify
this
admission
by
saying
that
he
had
been
told
of
dealings
by
others
before
april
but
he
could
give
no
details
and
the
evidence
of
the
marconi
company
broker
quoted
above
is
decisive
two
points
of
special
interest
emerged
from
his
evidence
the
first
was
that
he
had
not
told
the
whole
story
in
the
case
he
now
mentioned
that
lloyd
george
and
elibank
had
sold
a
further
of
the
shares
he
held
for
them
on
the
second
day
july
and
went
on
to
tell
of
the
purchase
of
shares
by
the
same
pair
the
bear
transaction
of
may
the
second
was
more
unpleasing
still
he
admitted
that
he
had
told
the
story
of
the
american
marconis
privately
to
two
friends
the
falconer
and
booth
who
had
kept
the
matter
to
themselves
and
had
or
at
least
appeared
to
have
continually
steered
the
committee
away
from
this
dangerous
ground
rufus
isaacs
son
actually
says
that
his
father
had
informed
falconer
and
handel
booth
privately
of
these
transactions
in
order
that
they
might
be
forearmed
when
the
journalists
came
to
give
evidence
isaacs
first
marquess
of
p
on
march
lloyd
george
appeared
before
the
committee
charles
masterman
gives
an
account
of
rufus
isaacs
grooming
lloyd
george
for
the
event
there
was
a
really
very
comic
though
somewhat
alarming
scene
between
rufus
and
george
on
the
following
sunday
george
had
to
give
evidence
on
the
monday
the
following
day
and
rufus
discovered
that
george
was
still
in
a
perfect
fog
as
to
what
his
transaction
really
had
been
and
began
talking
about
buying
a
bear
i
have
never
seen
rufus
so
nearly
lose
his
temper
and
george
got
extremely
sulky
while
rufus
patiently
reminded
him
what
he
had
paid
what
he
still
owed
when
he
had
paid
it
who
to
and
what
for
it
was
on
that
occasion
also
that
charlie
and
rufus
tried
to
impress
upon
him
with
all
the
force
in
their
power
to
avoid
technical
terms
and
to
stick
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
plainest
and
most
ordinary
language
is
well
known
george
made
a
great
success
of
his
italics
mine
p
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
thought
so
hugh
description
in
the
of
isaacs
and
lloyd
george
as
they
appeared
before
the
committee
accords
perfectly
with
the
impression
produced
by
a
reading
of
the
evidence
while
the
simile
of
a
panther
at
bay
anxious
to
escape
but
ready
with
tooth
and
claw
might
be
applied
to
sir
rufus
isaacs
something
more
like
a
rat
in
a
corner
might
be
suggested
by
the
restless
snapping
furious
little
figure
which
succeeded
let
us
compromise
by
saying
that
lloyd
george
was
singularly
like
a
spitting
angry
cat
which
had
got
perhaps
out
of
serious
danger
from
her
pursuers
but
which
caterwauled
and
spat
and
swore
with
vigour
and
venomousness
quite
surprising
in
that
diminutive
bulk
dastardly
dishonourable
disgraceful
disreputable
skulking
cowardly
asked
why
he
had
not
mentioned
his
marconi
purchases
in
the
house
of
commons
lloyd
george
gave
two
answers
there
was
no
time
on
a
friday
afternoon
i
could
not
get
up
and
take
time
when
two
ministers
had
already
spoken
why
had
he
not
asked
to
be
heard
sooner
by
the
committee
he
understood
that
sir
rufus
had
expressed
the
willingness
of
all
the
accused
ministers
to
be
heard
like
sir
rufus
lloyd
george
mentioned
that
he
had
lost
money
on
his
marconi
transactions
the
obstruction
within
the
committee
continued
to
the
end
the
question
had
arisen
whether
godfrey
had
had
the
right
to
sell
the
shares
at
his
own
price
or
for
his
own
profit
he
had
sold
a
considerable
number
of
shares
to
relations
and
friends
at
whereas
shares
were
sold
to
the
general
public
at
others
of
his
shares
he
sold
on
the
stock
exchange
at
varying
prices
all
high
but
were
the
shares
his
or
did
they
belong
to
the
english
company
if
they
were
his
he
was
entitled
to
sacrifice
vast
profits
on
some
by
selling
at
cost
to
his
relations
and
to
take
solid
profits
on
others
by
selling
at
what
he
could
get
in
the
open
market
but
if
he
was
simply
selling
as
an
agent
of
the
company
he
had
no
right
to
make
so
fantastic
a
present
of
one
lot
of
shares
and
was
bound
to
hand
over
to
the
company
profits
made
on
the
others
he
told
the
committee
that
the
shares
had
been
sold
to
him
outright
but
that
he
had
passed
on
of
profits
to
the
company
he
said
that
a
record
of
this
sale
of
shares
to
him
would
be
found
in
the
minutes
of
the
english
company
the
books
of
the
company
were
inspected
and
it
was
found
that
no
such
minute
existed
lord
robert
cecil
naturally
wished
to
recall
godfrey
isaacs
to
explain
the
discrepancy
between
his
statements
and
the
records
the
usual
to
majority
decided
that
there
was
no
need
to
recall
godfrey
it
looked
rather
as
if
the
shares
godfrey
had
sold
to
harry
and
harry
to
rufus
at
such
favourable
prices
belonged
to
and
should
have
been
sold
for
the
profit
of
the
company
on
may
the
committee
concluded
its
hearings
and
its
members
were
marshalling
their
ideas
for
the
report
but
there
was
one
fact
for
them
and
the
public
still
to
learn
early
in
june
they
were
to
hear
about
it
a
london
stockbroker
had
absconded
a
trustee
was
appointed
to
handle
his
affairs
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
fleeing
stockbroker
had
acted
for
the
still
absent
elibank
had
indeed
bought
american
marconis
for
him
a
total
of
and
as
it
later
appeared
these
had
been
bought
for
the
funds
of
the
liberal
party
the
comment
of
june
on
the
totally
unnecessary
difficulty
which
has
been
placed
in
the
way
of
getting
at
the
truth
seems
moderate
enough
iii
the
trial
of
cecil
chesterton
meanwhile
the
had
not
been
neglecting
its
task
of
striking
at
every
point
that
looked
vulnerable
on
january
an
article
appeared
attacking
the
city
record
of
godfrey
isaacs
and
listing
the
bankrupt
companies
there
were
some
twenty
of
them
of
which
he
had
been
promoter
or
director
some
more
ardent
spirit
in
the
office
sent
sandwichmen
to
parade
up
and
down
in
front
of
godfrey
isaacs
own
office
bearing
a
placard
announcing
his
ghastly
failures
cecil
chesterton
said
later
that
he
had
not
ordered
this
to
be
done
but
he
refused
to
disclaim
responsibility
the
placard
was
the
last
straw
godfrey
solicitors
wrote
to
cecil
saying
that
godfrey
would
prosecute
unless
cecil
promised
to
make
no
further
statement
reflecting
on
his
honour
till
both
had
given
evidence
before
the
parliamentary
committee
cecil
replied
i
am
pleased
to
hear
that
your
client
godfrey
isaacs
proposes
to
bring
an
action
against
me
and
in
the
february
he
wrote
we
are
up
against
a
very
big
thing
you
can
not
have
the
honour
and
the
fun
of
attacking
wealthy
and
powerfully
entrenched
interests
without
the
cost
we
have
counted
the
cost
we
counted
it
long
ago
we
think
it
good
enough
much
more
than
good
enough
the
case
came
on
at
the
old
bailey
on
may
it
is
worth
recalling
the
exact
position
at
this
time
the
parliamentary
committee
had
concluded
its
hearings
three
weeks
earlier
and
was
now
preparing
its
report
cecil
chesterton
had
not
given
evidence
before
it
for
though
he
had
frequently
demanded
to
be
summoned
when
at
last
the
summons
came
he
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
and
the
further
plea
that
he
wished
to
reserve
his
evidence
for
his
own
trial
the
case
had
been
heard
a
couple
of
months
earlier
everything
that
was
ever
to
be
known
about
ministerial
dealings
in
marconis
was
by
now
known
except
for
elibank
separate
purchase
on
behalf
of
the
party
funds
which
was
made
public
just
at
the
end
of
the
trial
sir
edward
carson
and
smith
were
again
teamed
as
in
the
case
the
charge
was
criminal
libel
cecil
insisted
on
facing
the
charge
alone
his
various
contributors
had
joined
in
the
attack
but
cecil
would
not
give
the
names
of
the
authors
of
unsigned
articles
and
took
full
responsibility
as
editor
carson
opening
speech
for
the
prosecution
divided
the
six
alleged
libels
under
two
main
heads
one
set
said
carson
charged
godfrey
isaacs
with
being
a
corrupt
man
who
induced
his
corrupt
brother
to
use
his
influence
with
the
corrupt
samuel
to
get
a
corrupt
contract
entered
into
the
opening
attack
under
this
head
has
already
been
quoted
later
attacks
did
not
diminish
in
violence
the
swindle
or
rather
theft
impudent
and
barefaced
as
it
is
when
samuel
was
caught
with
his
hand
in
the
till
or
isaacs
if
you
prefer
to
put
it
that
way
the
second
set
charged
that
godfrey
isaacs
had
had
transactions
with
various
companies
which
had
the
not
been
his
brother
would
have
got
him
prosecuted
there
is
the
same
violence
here
this
is
not
the
first
time
in
the
marconi
affair
that
we
find
these
two
gentlemen
godfrey
and
rufus
swindling
and
again
the
files
at
somerset
house
of
the
isaacs
companies
cry
out
for
vengeance
on
the
man
who
created
them
who
manipulated
them
who
filled
them
with
his
own
creatures
who
worked
them
solely
for
his
own
ends
and
who
sought
to
get
rid
of
some
of
them
when
they
had
served
his
purpose
by
casting
the
expense
of
burial
on
to
the
public
purse
there
is
no
need
to
describe
the
case
in
detail
on
the
charges
concerned
with
the
contract
and
ministerial
corruption
the
same
witnesses
with
the
notable
exception
of
lloyd
george
gave
much
the
same
evidence
as
before
the
parliamentary
committee
very
little
that
was
new
emerged
the
contract
looked
worse
than
ever
after
cecil
chesterton
counsel
ernest
wild
had
examined
witnesses
but
justice
phillimore
insisted
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
whether
the
contract
was
badly
drawn
or
improvident
but
indeed
all
this
discussion
of
the
contract
was
given
an
air
of
unreality
by
the
extraordinary
line
the
chesterton
defence
took
it
distinguished
between
the
two
sets
of
charges
offering
to
justify
the
second
concerning
godfrey
isaacs
business
record
but
claiming
that
the
first
set
brought
accusation
of
corruption
not
against
godfrey
but
against
rufus
and
herbert
samuel
who
were
not
the
prosecutors
it
was
an
impossible
position
to
say
that
ministers
were
fraudulently
giving
a
fraudulent
contract
to
godfrey
isaacs
but
that
this
did
not
mean
that
he
was
in
the
fraud
cecil
showed
up
unhappily
under
on
this
matter
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
whole
campaign
worse
was
to
follow
for
cecil
withdrew
the
charges
of
corruption
he
had
levelled
at
the
ministers
here
are
extracts
from
the
relevant
sections
of
the
by
sir
edward
carson
carson
and
do
you
now
accuse
him
godfrey
isaacs
of
any
abominable
business
i
mean
in
relation
to
obtaining
the
contract
cecil
chesterton
yes
certainly
i
now
accuse
isaacs
of
very
abominable
conduct
between
march
and
july
carson
do
you
accuse
the
postmaster
general
of
dishonesty
or
corruption
chesterton
what
i
accused
the
postmaster
general
of
was
of
having
given
a
contract
which
was
a
byword
for
laxity
and
thereby
laying
himself
open
reasonably
to
the
suspicion
that
he
was
conferring
a
favour
on
godfrey
isaacs
because
he
was
the
brother
carson
i
must
repeat
my
question
do
you
accuse
the
of
anything
dishonest
or
dishonourable
chesterton
after
the
denials
on
oath
i
must
leave
the
question
i
will
not
accuse
him
of
perjury
carson
and
therefore
you
do
not
accuse
him
of
anything
dishonest
or
dishonourable
after
some
further
questioning
judge
that
is
evasion
do
you
or
do
you
not
accuse
him
chesterton
i
have
said
no
later
chesterton
my
idea
at
that
time
was
that
sir
rufus
isaacs
had
influenced
samuel
to
benefit
godfrey
isaacs
carson
you
have
not
that
opinion
now
chesterton
sir
rufus
has
denied
it
on
oath
and
i
accepted
his
denial
cecil
still
insisted
that
though
the
ministers
had
not
been
corrupted
what
had
come
to
light
about
godfrey
offer
of
american
marconi
shares
to
his
brother
showed
that
godfrey
had
tried
to
corrupt
them
godfrey
could
not
have
enjoyed
the
case
very
much
there
was
much
emphasis
on
his
concealment
of
clause
allowing
the
government
to
terminate
at
any
time
and
sir
alexander
king
secretary
to
the
post
office
admitted
that
godfrey
isaacs
had
asked
that
it
be
kept
quiet
but
this
was
not
among
the
accusations
cecil
had
levelled
at
him
in
his
summing
up
justice
phillimore
indicated
the
possibility
that
the
shares
godfrey
had
so
gaily
sold
belonged
not
to
himself
but
to
the
english
marconi
company
merely
adding
that
this
question
was
not
relevant
to
the
present
case
further
the
record
of
his
company
failures
rather
ghastly
here
is
a
section
of
his
as
to
the
companies
he
had
been
connected
with
before
the
marconi
company
remember
that
there
were
twenty
of
them
wild
i
am
trying
to
discover
a
success
judge
it
is
not
an
imputation
against
a
man
that
he
has
been
a
failure
wild
here
are
cases
after
cases
of
failure
isaacs
that
is
my
misfortune
judge
you
might
as
well
any
speculative
widow
wild
a
speculative
widow
would
not
be
concerned
in
the
management
wild
can
you
point
to
one
success
except
marconi
in
the
whole
of
your
career
isaacs
in
companies
wild
yes
isaacs
a
complete
success
no
i
should
not
call
any
one
of
them
a
complete
success
but
i
may
say
that
each
of
them
was
an
endeavour
to
develop
something
new
but
carson
had
made
the
point
in
his
opening
speech
that
though
godfrey
isaacs
had
been
connected
with
so
many
failures
he
had
not
been
accused
by
the
shareholders
of
anything
dishonourable
in
his
closing
speech
he
pointed
out
that
not
one
single
city
man
had
been
brought
forward
to
say
that
he
had
been
deceived
to
the
extent
of
one
sixpence
by
the
representations
of
mr
isaacs
and
indeed
the
evidence
called
by
the
defence
in
this
present
case
however
suspicious
it
may
have
made
some
of
his
actions
appear
did
not
establish
beyond
doubt
any
actual
illegality
the
trial
ended
on
june
the
judge
summed
up
heavily
against
cecil
chesterton
the
jury
was
out
only
forty
minutes
the
verdict
was
guilty
cecil
chesterton
says
the
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
to
friends
and
relations
who
sat
beside
the
dock
the
judge
preached
him
a
solemn
little
homily
and
then
imposed
a
fine
of
and
costs
the
chestertons
and
all
who
stood
with
them
held
that
so
mild
a
fine
instead
of
a
prison
sentence
for
one
who
had
been
found
guilty
of
criminal
libel
on
so
large
a
scale
was
in
itself
a
moral
victory
it
is
a
great
relief
to
us
ran
the
first
editorial
in
the
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
to
have
our
hands
free
we
have
long
desired
to
our
whole
case
about
the
marconi
disgrace
in
view
of
the
facts
that
are
now
before
us
and
the
english
people
when
we
began
our
attack
we
were
striking
at
something
very
powerful
and
very
dangerous
we
were
striking
at
it
in
the
dark
the
politicians
saw
to
that
our
defence
is
that
if
we
had
not
ventured
to
strike
in
the
dark
we
and
the
people
of
england
should
be
in
the
dark
still
there
can
be
no
question
of
cecil
chesterton
courage
but
he
may
have
exaggerated
a
little
in
saying
that
if
the
had
not
struck
in
the
dark
the
nation
would
still
be
in
the
dark
parliament
had
already
refused
to
approve
the
contract
without
proper
discussion
and
the
was
attacking
vigorously
the
first
attack
and
there
are
grave
drawbacks
to
the
making
of
charges
in
the
dark
which
later
have
to
be
withdrawn
withdrawal
of
his
charges
against
the
ministers
and
his
failure
to
substantiate
his
charges
against
godfrey
company
record
may
have
done
more
to
hinder
than
help
the
cause
of
clean
government
but
his
courage
remains
and
if
one
has
to
choose
one
prefers
the
immoderate
man
who
said
more
than
he
knew
to
the
careful
men
who
said
so
much
less
gilbert
giving
evidence
at
the
trial
had
said
that
he
envied
his
brother
the
dignity
of
his
present
position
and
with
the
isaacs
brothers
in
mind
one
sees
the
point
iv
after
thoughts
four
days
after
the
verdict
against
cecil
chesterton
the
parliamentary
committee
produced
its
report
there
had
been
a
draft
report
somewhat
critical
of
the
ministers
by
the
chairman
sir
albert
spicer
and
another
considerably
more
critical
by
lord
robert
cecil
lord
robert
report
said
that
rufus
isaacs
had
committed
grave
impropriety
in
making
an
advantageous
purchase
of
shares
upon
advice
and
information
not
yet
fully
available
to
the
public
by
doing
so
he
placed
himself
however
unwittingly
in
a
position
in
which
his
private
interests
or
sense
of
obligation
might
easily
have
been
in
conflict
with
his
public
duty
of
his
silence
in
the
house
lord
robert
said
we
regard
that
reticence
as
a
grave
error
of
judgment
and
as
wanting
in
frankness
and
in
respect
for
the
house
of
commons
upon
this
rufus
isaacs
son
comments
the
vehemence
of
this
language
was
not
calculated
to
commend
the
draft
to
the
majority
of
the
committee
vehemence
seems
hardly
the
word
but
at
any
rate
the
committee
did
not
adopt
either
lord
robert
report
or
sir
albert
spicer
by
the
usual
party
vote
of
to
it
adopted
a
report
prepared
by
falconer
one
of
the
two
whom
rufus
isaacs
had
approached
privately
which
simply
took
the
line
that
the
ministers
had
acted
in
good
faith
and
refrained
from
criticising
them
parliament
debated
the
matter
a
few
days
later
on
a
conservative
motion
that
this
house
regrets
the
transactions
of
certain
of
its
ministers
in
the
shares
of
the
marconi
company
of
america
and
the
want
of
frankness
displayed
by
ministers
in
their
communications
on
the
subject
to
the
house
rufus
isaacs
son
speaks
of
the
certain
ruin
of
his
father
career
if
by
some
unpredictable
misadventure
the
motion
had
been
carried
it
would
indeed
have
had
to
be
an
unpredictable
misadventure
for
the
voting
was
on
the
strictest
party
lines
which
means
that
the
house
did
not
express
its
real
opinion
at
all
the
motion
was
defeated
by
to
lloyd
george
and
rufus
isaacs
expressed
regret
for
any
indiscretion
there
might
have
been
in
their
actions
rufus
explained
that
he
would
not
have
bought
the
shares
if
i
had
thought
that
men
could
be
so
suspicious
of
any
action
of
mine
in
the
debate
the
leader
of
the
opposition
arthur
balfour
somewhat
disdainfully
refused
to
make
political
capital
out
of
the
business
lloyd
george
and
isaacs
were
loudly
cheered
by
their
own
party
though
whether
they
were
cheered
for
having
bought
american
marconis
or
for
having
concealed
the
purchase
from
the
house
there
is
now
no
means
of
discovering
at
any
rate
their
careers
were
not
damaged
the
one
went
on
to
become
lord
chief
justice
of
england
and
later
viceroy
of
india
the
other
became
prime
minister
during
the
war
of
one
question
arising
from
the
episode
is
whether
it
meant
what
cecil
chesterton
and
belloc
thought
it
meant
in
the
world
of
party
politics
or
something
entirely
different
they
seem
throughout
to
have
assumed
that
their
thesis
of
collusion
between
the
party
leaders
was
proved
by
this
scandal
it
seems
to
me
quite
as
easy
to
make
the
case
that
it
was
a
conservative
first
raises
the
matter
by
inconvenient
questions
in
the
house
a
group
of
young
conservatives
pay
the
costs
of
cecil
chesterton
defence
when
a
parliamentary
committee
is
appointed
to
enquire
into
the
alleged
corruption
the
story
of
every
session
becomes
one
of
a
conservative
minority
trying
hard
to
ferret
out
the
truth
and
a
ministerial
majority
determined
to
prevent
their
succeeding
finally
the
leading
conservative
commissioner
lord
robert
cecil
issues
a
restrained
but
most
damning
report
which
is
as
a
matter
of
course
rejected
by
the
liberal
majority
a
conservative
told
me
he
thought
the
great
mistake
made
was
that
it
had
all
been
made
too
much
of
a
party
question
unless
you
already
disbelieved
quite
violently
in
the
existence
of
the
two
parties
this
would
certainly
be
the
effect
upon
you
of
reading
the
report
of
the
commission
sessions
and
all
that
can
be
set
against
it
is
the
fact
that
balfour
did
in
the
house
of
commons
utter
a
conventional
form
of
words
which
as
has
been
said
really
amounted
to
a
refusal
to
make
political
capital
out
of
the
affair
i
do
not
say
for
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
if
this
is
the
correct
interpretation
it
is
certainly
the
obvious
one
douglas
jerrold
in
a
brilliant
article
on
belloc
treats
his
theory
of
the
party
system
as
a
false
one
and
maintains
that
he
mistook
for
collusion
that
degree
of
that
alone
could
enable
a
country
to
be
governed
at
all
under
a
party
system
a
certain
continuity
must
be
preserved
if
in
the
old
phrase
the
government
is
to
be
carried
on
but
such
continuity
did
not
spell
a
corrupt
collusion
if
at
this
distance
of
time
such
a
view
can
be
held
by
a
man
of
jerrold
ability
it
could
certainly
be
held
at
the
time
by
the
majority
and
it
may
be
that
the
continual
assumption
of
an
unproved
fact
got
in
the
way
in
the
fight
against
more
obvious
evil
hilaire
belloc
and
the
counter
revolution
in
hilaire
for
bound
up
with
this
question
is
another
eye
seemed
so
near
success
and
yet
never
quite
succeeded
might
it
have
done
so
had
it
been
founded
with
a
single
eye
to
creative
opportunity
to
the
attack
on
the
servile
state
and
the
building
of
some
small
beginning
of
an
alternative
was
a
slight
improvement
from
that
point
of
view
for
it
did
create
the
distributist
league
but
both
papers
i
think
had
from
their
inception
a
divided
purpose
that
made
failure
almost
inevitable
the
fight
against
corruption
which
had
been
placed
equal
with
the
fight
for
property
and
liberty
at
the
start
of
the
is
a
noble
aim
but
like
the
other
it
is
a
life
work
to
do
it
a
man
must
have
time
to
spend
verifying
rumours
or
exploding
them
following
up
clues
patiently
waiting
on
events
i
began
to
read
the
files
with
an
assumption
of
the
accuracy
of
the
claims
of
the
and
as
to
its
own
achievement
in
all
this
but
when
the
dates
and
facts
in
the
marconi
case
had
been
tabulated
for
me
chronologically
i
began
to
wonder
again
and
again
the
editor
stated
that
new
had
been
first
to
unearth
the
marconi
matter
but
it
had
as
we
have
seen
questions
in
the
house
and
attacks
in
other
papers
had
their
first
mention
of
the
subject
so
too
the
statement
that
the
marconi
affair
had
proved
how
little
englishmen
cared
about
corruption
seemed
almost
absurd
when
one
read
not
only
the
conservative
but
also
the
liberal
comment
of
the
time
political
corruption
is
the
achilles
heel
of
liberalism
said
an
outstanding
liberal
editor
while
hugh
in
the
paraphrased
the
wail
of
the
cadbury
papers
is
the
voice
of
the
cocoa
i
hear
it
exclaim
o
geordie
dear
geordie
do
do
it
again
just
how
scandalous
the
marconi
scandal
at
this
distance
of
time
it
is
difficult
to
arrive
at
any
clear
view
there
are
two
main
problems
the
contract
and
the
purchase
of
american
marconis
the
contract
seems
very
definitely
to
have
been
unduly
favourable
to
the
company
clauses
were
so
badly
drawn
that
they
had
to
be
supplemented
by
letters
which
had
no
legal
effect
documents
were
lost
other
tenders
misinterpreted
other
systems
perhaps
not
fully
examined
the
report
of
a
shelved
godfrey
isaacs
allowed
to
issue
a
misleading
report
without
correction
from
the
post
office
it
all
may
spell
corruption
but
it
need
not
no
one
familiar
with
the
workings
of
a
government
department
is
likely
to
be
surprised
at
any
amount
of
muddle
and
incompetence
matters
are
forgotten
and
then
in
the
effort
to
make
up
for
lost
time
important
steps
are
simply
omitted
officials
are
and
unreasonable
and
as
to
lost
documents
what
of
the
ministers
dealings
in
shares
godfrey
may
have
been
using
rufus
to
purchase
ministerial
favour
if
so
he
could
hardly
have
done
so
on
the
comparatively
small
scale
of
the
dealings
known
to
us
the
few
thousand
involved
could
not
have
meant
an
enormous
amount
to
rufus
he
had
it
is
true
begun
his
career
on
the
stock
exchange
found
himself
insolvent
and
been
hammered
but
he
had
gone
on
to
make
large
sums
at
the
bar
up
to
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
his
salary
as
was
twenty
thousand
a
year
there
may
of
course
have
been
far
heavier
purchases
than
we
know
about
the
emergence
of
what
we
do
know
gives
us
no
confidence
that
all
the
pieces
ever
emerged
we
have
only
the
word
of
the
two
brothers
for
most
of
the
story
and
one
comes
to
feel
that
their
word
has
no
great
meaning
but
allowing
for
all
that
it
is
possible
that
godfrey
may
have
wanted
rufus
to
have
the
american
shares
out
of
family
affection
of
the
shares
godfrey
personally
disposed
of
a
very
large
number
went
to
relations
and
close
friends
mother
sisters
his
wife
relations
who
certainly
could
not
help
to
get
his
contract
through
parliament
if
this
the
most
charitable
interpretation
is
also
the
true
one
rufus
and
his
political
friends
acted
with
considerable
impropriety
in
snatching
at
this
opportunity
of
quick
and
easy
money
the
rest
of
the
story
is
of
their
efforts
to
prevent
this
impropriety
being
discovered
had
they
mentioned
it
openly
in
parliament
on
october
the
matter
might
have
ended
there
but
they
lacked
the
nerve
the
occasion
passed
and
nothing
remained
especially
for
rufus
but
evasion
shiftiness
passing
as
whole
truth
the
farce
of
indignant
virtue
a
performance
which
left
him
not
a
shred
of
dignity
and
ought
to
have
made
it
unthinkable
that
he
should
ever
again
be
given
public
office
the
perfect
word
on
the
whole
episode
was
uttered
not
by
either
gilbert
or
cecil
chesterton
or
by
any
of
their
friends
but
by
rudyard
kipling
the
case
had
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
on
june
a
conservative
neighbour
of
kipling
wrote
to
gilbert
i
can
not
let
the
days
pass
without
writing
to
congratulate
you
and
your
brother
on
the
result
of
the
isaacs
trial
i
do
feel
as
many
thousands
of
english
people
must
feel
that
the
is
fighting
on
the
side
of
english
nationalism
and
that
is
our
common
battle
my
neighbour
rudyard
kipling
has
followed
every
phase
of
the
fight
with
interest
of
such
a
kind
that
it
almost
precluded
his
thinking
of
anything
else
at
all
and
when
he
gets
hold
of
the
my
copy
i
never
can
get
it
back
again
you
see
however
much
we
have
all
disagreed
do
disagree
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
about
a
lot
of
things
of
the
first
rank
we
ca
afford
to
differ
just
now
if
we
do
agree
it
all
too
serious
when
isaacs
was
appointed
viceroy
of
india
kipling
wrote
the
poem
gehazi
whence
comest
thou
gehazi
so
reverend
to
behold
in
scarlet
and
in
ermine
and
chain
of
england
gold
from
following
after
naaman
to
tell
him
all
is

whereby
my
zeal

made
me
a

as
thou
of

try
the
truthful

that
tells
the
blacker
lie
the
loud
uneasy
virtue
the
anger
feigned
at

to
overbear
a
witness
and
make
the
court

take
order
now
gehazi
that
no
man
talk
aside
in
secret
with
the
judges
the
while
his
case
is
tried
lest
he
should
show
them
reason
to
keep
the
matter
hid
and
subtly
lead
the
questions
away
from
what
he

judge
in

a

white
as
snow
as
the
leading
article
of
june
put
it
a
man
is
not
blamed
for
being
splashed
with
mud
he
is
commiserated
but
if
he
has
stepped
into
a
puddle
which
he
might
easily
have
avoided
we
say
that
it
is
his
own
fault
if
he
protests
that
he
did
not
know
it
was
a
puddle
we
say
that
he
ought
to
know
better
but
if
he
says
that
it
was
after
all
quite
a
clean
puddle
then
we
judge
him
deficient
in
the
sense
of
cleanliness
and
the
british
public
like
their
public
men
to
have
a
very
nice
sense
of
cleanliness
that
fundamentally
was
what
troubled
gilbert
chesterton
then
and
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
was
not
himself
an
investigator
of
political
scandals
in
that
field
he
trusted
his
brother
and
belloc
and
on
this
particular
matter
cecil
had
certainly
said
more
than
he
knew
and
possibly
more
than
was
true
but
it
did
not
take
an
expert
to
know
that
some
of
the
men
involved
in
the
marconi
case
had
no
very
nice
sense
of
cleanliness
and
these
men
were
going
to
be
dominant
in
the
councils
of
england
and
to
represent
england
in
the
face
of
the
world
for
a
long
time
to
come

earlier
years
of
the

had
nothing
to
do
with
the
editing
and
his
contributions
to
it
were
only
part
of
the
continuing
volume
of
his
weekly
journalism
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
trace
all
the
articles
in
papers
and
magazines
that
were
never
republished
the
volumes
of
essays
appearing

by

probably
contained

best

was
still
in

every
week
until
his
death
he
continued
to
do

have
found
an
unpublished
ballade
he
wrote
on
the
subject

of
a
periodical
in
icy
circles
by
the
behring
strait
in
moony
jungles
where
the
tigers
roar
in

where
civil

wait

wonder
what

debating
and

went
on
and
an
amusing
letter
from
bernard

shows
the
preparations
for
a
three
star
show
shaw
against
chesterton
with
belloc
in
the
chair
in
an
exactly
similar
debate
years
later
was
published
in
a
slender
volume
entitled
we
agree
on
both
occasions
the
crowd
was
enormous
and
many
had
to
be
turned
away
all
three
men
were
immensely
popular
figures
and
all
three
were
at
their
best
debating
in
a
hall
of
moderate
size
where
swift
repartee
could
be
followed
by
the
whole
audience
gilbert
always
shone
on
these
occasions
the
challenge
of
a
debate
brought
forth
all
his
powers
of
wit
and
humour
his
opponent
furnished
material
on
which
he
could
work
and
how
he
enjoyed
himself
frank
swinnerton
once
heard
him
laugh
so
much
that
he
gave
himself
hiccups
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
heard
him
against
miss
cicely
hamilton
and
against
selfridge
and
felt
the
only
drawback
to
be
that
the
fight
was
so
very
unequal
the
selfridge
debate
in
particular
was
sheer
cruelty
so
utterly
unaware
was
the
business
man
that
he
was
being
intellectually
massacred
by
a
man
who
regarded
all
that
selfridge
stores
stood
for
as
the
ruin
of
england
occasionally
selfridge
looked
bewildered
when
the
audience
rocked
with
laughter
at
some
phrase
that
clearly
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
at
all
but
so
complete
was
his
failure
to
understand
what
it
was
all
about
that
when
the
meeting
was
over
he
asked
if
chesterton
would
not
write
his
name
with
a
diamond
on
a
window
of
his
store
already
graced
with
many
great
names
for
once
chesterton
was
at
a
loss
for
words
oh
how
jolly
he
murmured
feebly
very
different
was
it
when
he
debated
with
bernard
shaw
with
belloc
as
third
performer
ayot
lawrence
welwyn
herts
do
be
dismayed
this
does
need
a
reply
my
dear
with
reference
to
this
silly
debate
of
ours
what
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
is
this
i
am
prepared
to
accept
any
conditions
if
they
seem
unfair
to
me
from
the
front
of
the
house
all
the
better
for
me
therefore
do
not
give
me
that
advantage
unless
you
wish
to
or
are
as
you
probably
are
as
indifferent
to
the
rules
as
i
am
the
old
debates
was
a
were
arranged
thus
each
debater
made
speeches
of
minutes
of
and
of
strict
time
was
kept
the
audiences
were
intensely
jealous
of
the
least
departure
from
the
rules
and
the
chairman
simply
explained
the
conditions
and
called
time
without
touching
the
subject
of
debate
the
advantages
of
this
were
a
that
the
opponent
or
the
opener
could
introduce
fresh
matter
up
to
the
end
of
his
second
speech
and
was
tied
up
in
that
respect
for
the
last
minutes
only
and
b
that
the
debate
was
one
against
one
and
not
one
against
two
and
with
less
time
allowed
for
him
at
that
as
it
must
have
been
had
the
chairman
dealt
with
the
subject
the
disadvantages
for
us
are
that
we
both
want
belloc
to
let
himself
go
i
simply
thirst
for
the
blood
of
his
servile
state
servile
him
and
nobody
wants
to
tie
you
down
to
matter
previously
introduced
when
you
make
your
final
reply
we
shall
all
three
talk
all
over
the
shop
possibly
never
reaching
the
socialism
department
and
belloc
will
not
trouble
himself
about
the
rules
of
public
meeting
and
debate
even
if
there
were
any
reason
to
suppose
that
he
is
acquainted
with
them
do
you
recollect
how
parnell
and
biggar
floored
the
house
in
the
palmy
days
of
obstruction
by
meanly
getting
up
the
subject
of
public
order
which
no
one
else
suspected
the
existence
of
i
therefore
conclude
that
we
had
better
make
it
to
some
extent
a
clowns
cricket
match
and
go
ahead
as
in
the
debates
with
sanders
macdonald
cicely
hamilton
which
were
all
wrong
technically
in
a
really
hostile
debate
it
is
better
to
be
as
strict
as
possible
but
as
this
is
going
to
be
a
performance
in
which
three
macs
who
are
on
the
friendliest
terms
in
private
will
belabor
each
other
recklessly
on
wooden
scalps
and
pillowed
waistcoats
and
trouser
seats
we
need
not
be
particular
still
you
had
better
know
exactly
what
you
are
doing
hence
this
wildly
hurried
scrawl
did
you
see
my
letter
in
tuesday
magnificent
my
love
to
chesterton
and
my
most
distinguished
consideration
to
winkle
to
hell
with
the
pope
the
chestertons
dog
who
preceded
quoodle
of
the
poem
ever
i
told
sanders
to
explain
to
you
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
half
the
gate
or
a
third
if
belloc
shares
and
that
you
were
likely
to
overlook
this
if
you
were
not
warned
i
take
it
that
you
have
settled
this
somehow
at
the
second
of
these
debates
belloc
opened
the
proceedings
by
announcing
to
the
audience
you
are
about
to
listen
i
am
about
to
sneer
his
only
contribution
to
the
debate
was
to
recite
a
poem
our
civilisation
is
built
upon
coal
let
us
chant
in
rotation
our
civilisation
that
lump
of
damnation
without
any
soul

bernard
shaw
was
on
the
friendliest
terms
with
the
others
and
admired
their
genius
but
thought
it
ill
directed
belloc
he
had
told
chesterton
was
wasting
prodigious
gifts
in
the
service
of
the
pope
i
have
not
met
shaw
always
calls
him
a
man
of
colossal
genius
writes
lawrence
of
arabia
to
a
friend
as
a
lecturer
chesterton
success
was
less
certain
than
as
a
debater
many
of
his
greatest
admirers
say
they
have
heard
him
give
very
poor
lectures
he
was
often
nervous
and
worried
beforehand
as
a
lecture
wrote
the
weekly
after
a
performance
in
this
year
it
was
a
fiasco
but
as
an
exhibition
of
chesterton
it
was
pleasing
although
his
writing
appeared
almost
effortless
he
did
in
fact
take
far
more
pains
about
it
than
he
did
in
preparing
for
a
lecture
he
seemed
quite
incapable
of
remembering
the
time
or
place
of
appointment
or
of
getting
there
on
time
if
at
all
stories
are
told
of
his
on
various
platforms
my
husband
remembers
a
meeting
in
a
london
theatre
at
which
chesterton
had
been
billed
as
one
of
the
speakers
the
meeting
arranged
by
the
knights
of
the
blessed
sacrament
was
well
under
way
before
he
arrived
panting
but
unperturbed
his
apology
ran
something
like
this
as
knights
you
will
understand
my
not
being
here
at
the
beginning
for
the
whole
point
of
knighthood
was
that
the
knight
should
arrive
late
but
not
too
late
had
george
not
been
late
there
would
have
been
no
story
had
he
been
too
late
there
would
have
been
no
princess
even
more
annoying
was
his
habit
of
beginning
his
lecture
by
saying
he
had
not
prepared
it
such
a
remark
is
not
likely
to
please
any
audience
least
of
all
an
audience
that
has
paid
for
admission
and
knows
that
the
lecturer
is
receiving
a
large
fee
but
money
whether
he
was
receiving
it
or
giving
it
away
meant
nothing
to
him
he
had
not
a
strong
voice
and
i
have
seen
him
when
a
microphone
was
provided
holding
a
paper
of
notes
between
himself
and
it
an
ardent
admirer
of
his
writing
told
me
he
made
far
too
many
jokes
about
his
size
yet
how
pleasing
they
sometimes
were
when
his
chairman
for
instance
after
a
long
wait
said
he
had
feared
a
traffic
accident
had
i
met
a
chesterton
replied
it
would
have
been
a
great
and
if
i
may
say
so
an
equal
encounter
he
thought
badly
of
his
own
lecturing
and
began
once
by
saying
i
might
call
myself
a
lecturer
but
then
again
i
fear
some
of
you
may
have
attended
my
lectures
actually
in
spite
of
the
jokes
his
thoughts
were
centred
entirely
on
his
subject
not
on
himself
an
anonymous
society
diarist
quoted
by
cosmo
hamilton
writes
of
an
occasion
when
he
was
given
rather
foolishly
a
little
gold
period
chair
and
as
he
made
his
points
it
slowly
collapsed
under
him
he
rose
just
in
time
and
sinking
into
another
chair
that
someone
put
behind
him
began
at
the
word
he
had
last
spoken
no
acting
could
have
secured
such
an
effect
of
complete
indifference
it
was
evident
that
he
had
barely
noticed
the
incident
ellis
roberts
completes
the
picture
he
knew
gilbert
already
as
a
brilliant
talker
and
came
to
hear
him
from
a
platform
i
remember
the
manner
of
his
lecture
it
seemed
to
be
written
on
a
hundred
pieces
of
variously
shaped
paper
written
in
ink
and
pencil
of
all
colours
and
in
chalk
all
the
pages
were
in
a
splendid
and
startling
disorder
and
i
remember
being
at
first
a
little
disappointed
then
the
papers
were
abandoned
and
talked
for
p
at
this
time
bernard
shaw
scored
a
victory
over
his
friend
for
beside
lecturing
journalism
and
the
publication
of
three
considerable
and
two
minor
books
chesterton
between
and
the
war
wrote
the
play
that
shaw
had
been
so
insistently
demanding
the
books
were
miscellany
of
essays
victorian
age
in
february
wisdom
of
father
flying
the
play
was
produced
at
the
little
theatre
in
october
one
who
admired
it
was
george
moore
he
wrote
to
forster
bovill
november
i
followed
the
comedy
of
from
the
first
line
to
the
last
with
interest
and
appreciation
and
i
am
not
exaggerating
when
i
say
that
i
think
of
all
modern
plays
i
like
it
the
best
chesterton
wished
to
express
an
idea
and
his
construction
and
his
dialogue
are
the
best
that
he
could
have
chosen
for
the
expression
of
that
idea
therefore
i
look
upon
the
play
as
practically
perfect
the
prologue
seems
unnecessary
likewise
the
magician
love
for
the
young
lady
that
she
should
love
the
magician
is
well
enough
but
it
materialises
him
a
little
too
much
if
he
returns
that
love
i
would
have
preferred
her
to
love
him
more
and
he
to
love
her
less
but
this
spot
if
it
be
a
spot
is
a
very
small
one
on
a
spotless
surface
of
excellence
i
hope
i
can
rely
upon
you
to
tell
chesterton
how
much
i
appreciated
his
play
as
i
should
like
him
to
know
my
artistic
sympathies
artistic
sympathies
is
not
ungenerous
considering
how
chesterton
had
written
of
george
moore
in
it
is
rather
comic
that
all
the
reviews
hailing
from
germany
where
the
play
was
very
soon
produced
compare
chesterton
with
shaw
and
many
of
them
say
that
he
is
the
better
playwright
he
means
more
to
it
a
munich
paper
was
translated
as
saying
than
the
good
old
shaw
chesterton
superiority
can
hardly
be
entertained
in
the
matter
of
technique
actually
what
the
critic
meant
was
that
he
preferred
the
ideas
of
chesterton
to
the
ideas
of
shaw
both
men
were
chiefly
concerned
with
ideas
but
while
shaw
excelled
chiefly
in
presenting
them
through
brilliant
dialogue
deeper
thoughts
were
conveyed
in
another
fashion
the
duke
might
almost
it
is
true
have
been
a
shaw
character
but
the
fun
the
audience
got
out
of
him
was
the
least
thing
they
received
chesterton
once
said
that
he
suspected
shaw
of
being
the
only
man
who
had
never
written
any
poetry
many
of
us
suspect
that
chesterton
never
wrote
anything
else
this
play
is
a
poem
and
the
greatest
character
in
it
is
atmosphere
chesterton
believed
in
the
love
of
god
and
man
he
believed
in
the
devil
love
conquers
diabolical
evil
and
the
atmosphere
of
this
struggle
is
felt
even
in
the
written
page
and
was
felt
more
vividly
in
the
theatre
after
a
passage
of
many
years
those
who
saw
it
remember
the
moment
when
the
red
lamp
turned
blue
as
a
felt
experience
but
as
to
popularity
in
england
at
least
it
would
be
absurd
to
compare
with
the
play
run
was
a
brief
one
and
it
was
years
before
he
attempted
another
chesterton
was
fighting
corruption
fighting
the
servile
state
above
all
things
he
was
fighting
sterility
fighting
it
in
the
name
of
life
life
with
its
richness
its
variety
its
sins
and
its
virtues
with
its
positively
outrageous
sanity
thank
you
for
being
alive
wrote
an
admirer
to
him
is
above
all
things
a
hymn
to
life
it
is
the
acid
test
of
a
chestertonian
reviewers
became
wildly
enthusiastic
or
bitterly
scornful
borrowing
from
his
own
phrase
about
pickwick
i
am
inclined
to
say
that
men
not
in
love
with
life
will
not
appreciate
nor
i
should
imagine
heaven
the
ideas
that
make
up
the
book
had
been
long
in
his
head
the
story
of
white
wynd
written
while
he
was
at
the
slade
school
tells
one
half
of
the
story
an
unpublished
fragment
of
the
same
period
entitled
the
burden
of
balham
the
other
half
the
great
wind
that
blows
innocent
smith
to
beacon
house
is
the
wind
of
life
and
it
blows
through
the
whole
story
before
an
improvised
court
of
law
smith
is
tried
on
three
charges
housebreaking
but
it
was
his
own
house
that
he
broke
into
to
renew
the
vividness
of
ownership
bigamy
but
it
was
his
own
wife
with
whom
he
repeatedly
eloped
to
renew
the
ecstasy
of
first
love
murder
with
a
large
and
terrifying
revolver
but
he
dealt
life
not
death
from
its
barrel
for
he
used
it
only
to
threaten
those
who
said
they
were
tired
of
life
or
that
life
was
not
worth
living
and
he
forced
them
through
fear
of
death
to
hymn
the
praises
of
life
the
explanation
given
by
smith
to
eames
the
master
of
brakespeare
college
of
his
ideas
and
his
purpose
gives
the
note
of
fooling
and
profundity
filling
the
whole
book
i
want
both
my
gifts
to
come
virgin
and
violent
the
death
and
the
life
after
death
i
am
going
to
hold
a
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
modern
man
but
i
shall
not
use
it
to
kill
him
only
to
bring
him
to
life
i
begin
to
see
a
new
meaning
in
being
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
you
can
scarcely
be
called
a
skeleton
said
eames
smiling
that
comes
of
being
so
much
at
the
feast
answered
the
massive
youth
no
skeleton
can
keep
his
figure
if
he
is
always
dining
out
but
that
is
not
quite
what
i
meant
what
i
mean
is
that
i
caught
a
kind
of
glimpse
of
the
meaning
of
death
and
all
that
the
skull
and
the
crossbones
the
it
is
only
meant
to
remind
us
of
a
future
life
but
to
remind
us
of
a
present
life
too
with
our
weak
spirits
we
should
grow
old
in
eternity
if
we
were
not
kept
young
by
death
providence
has
to
cut
immortality
into
lengths
for
us
as
nurses
cut
the
bread
and
butter
into
fingers
appeared
in
next
year
came
what
is
perhaps
his
single
piece
of
writing
the
of
in
the
spring
of
he
had
taken
part
in
a
debate
at
leeds
affirming
that
all
wars
were
religious
wars
father
supported
him
with
a
magnificent
description
of
the
battle
of
lepanto
obviously
it
seized
gilbert
mind
powerfully
for
while
he
was
still
staying
with
father
he
had
begun
to
jot
down
lines
and
by
october
of
that
year
the
poem
was
published
one
might
fill
a
book
with
the
tributes
it
has
received
from
that
day
to
this
perhaps
none
pleased
him
more
than
a
note
from
john
buchan
june
the
other
day
in
the
trenches
we
shouted
your
lepanto
victorian
age
in
made
many
of
his
admirers
again
express
the
wish
that
he
would
stay
in
the
field
of
pure
literature
his
characterisations
of
some
of
the
victorian
writers
were
sheer
delight
ruskin
had
a
strong
right
hand
that
wrote
of
the
great
mediaeval
minsters
in
tall
harmonies
and
traceries
as
splendid
as
their
own
and
also
so
to
speak
a
weak
and
feverish
left
hand
that
was
always
fidgeting
and
trying
to
take
the
pen
away
and
write
an
evangelical
tract
about
the
immorality
of
foreigners
it
is
not
quite
unfair
to
say
of
him
that
he
seemed
to
want
all
parts
of
the
cathedral
except
the
altar
tennyson
was
a
provincial
virgil
he
tried
to
have
the
universal
balance
of
all
the
ideas
at
which
the
great
roman
had
aimed
but
he
had
got
hold
of
all
the
ideas
to
balance
hence
his
work
was
not
a
balance
of
truths
like
the
universe
it
was
a
balance
of
whims
like
the
british
constitution
he
could
not
think
up
to
the
height
of
his
own
towering
style
while
emily
bronte
was
as
unsociable
as
a
storm
at
midnight
and
while
charlotte
bronte
was
at
best
like
that
warmer
and
more
domestic
thing
a
house
on
fire
they
do
connect
themselves
with
the
calm
of
george
eliot
as
the
forerunners
of
many
later
developments
of
the
feminine
advance
many
forerunners
if
it
comes
to
that
would
have
felt
rather
ill
if
they
had
seen
the
things
they
foreran
the
best
and
most
profound
part
of
the
book
was
however
the
working
out
of
certain
generalisations
the
effect
on
the
literature
of
the
period
of
the
victorian
compromise
between
religion
and
rationalism
macaulay
it
is
said
never
talked
about
his
religion
but
huxley
was
always
talking
about
the
religion
he
had
got
the
of
the
compromise
when
victorian
protestantism
and
victorian
rationalism
simultaneously
destroyed
one
another
the
uniqueness
of
the
of
the
later
victorian
period
in
one
illuminating
passage
chesterton
defends
what
seems
at
first
sight
merely
his
own
habit
of
getting
dates
and
events
in
their
wrong
order
the
mind
moves
by
instincts
associations
premonitions
and
not
by
fixed
dates
or
completed
processes
action
and
reaction
will
occur
simultaneously
or
the
cause
actually
be
found
after
the
effect
errors
will
be
resisted
before
they
have
been
properly
promulgated
notions
will
be
first
defined
long
after
they
are
dead
thus
wordsworth
shrank
back
into
toryism
as
it
were
from
a
shelleyan
extreme
of
pantheism
as
yet
disembodied
thus
newman
took
down
the
iron
sword
of
dogma
to
parry
a
blow
not
yet
delivered
that
was
coming
from
the
club
of
darwin
for
this
reason
no
one
can
understand
tradition
or
even
history
who
has
not
some
tenderness
for
anachronism
this
was
not
merely
special
pleading
it
contains
a
profound
truth
wilfrid
ward
proved
it
of
newman
in
the
biography
that
had
probably
just
been
reading
chesterton
noted
it
himself
in
his
book
on
cobbett
who
as
he
said
saw
what
was
not
yet
there
it
is
almost
the
definition
of
genius
already
at
this
date
chesterton
and
belloc
were
fighting
much
that
to
the
rest
of
us
only
became
fully
apparent
long
afterwards
i
think
you
would
make
a
very
good
god
wrote
lucas
to
chesterton
there
is
indeed
something
divine
in
an
almost
ceaseless
outpouring
of
creative
energy
but
only
god
can
create
tirelessly
and
chesterton
was
at
this
time
beginning
to
be
tired
you
can
see
it
in
flying
the
book
is
still
full
of
vitality
and
the
lyrics
in
it
later
published
separately
under
the
title
water
and
are
as
good
in
that
kind
as
any
that
he
ever
wrote
but
with
all
its
vigour
the
book
is
a
less
joyful
one
than
and
it
is
a
much
more
angry
one
was
a
paean
of
joy
to
life
flying
is
fighting
for
something
necessary
to
its
fulness
freedom
it
must
have
been
just
while
he
was
writing
it
that
there
were
threatenings
of
a
case
against
him
by
lever
brothers
on
account
of
a
lecture
given
at
the
city
temple
on
the
snob
as
socialist
in
answering
a
question
he
spoke
of
port
sunlight
as
corresponding
to
a
slave
compound
others
besides
lever
brothers
were
shocked
and
some
clarification
was
certainly
called
for
belloc
and
chesterton
meant
by
slavery
not
that
the
poor
were
being
bullied
or
ill
treated
but
that
they
had
lost
their
liberty
gilbert
went
so
far
as
to
point
out
how
much
there
was
to
be
said
in
defence
of
a
slave
state
under
slavery
the
poor
were
usually
fed
clothed
and
housed
adequately
slaves
had
often
been
much
more
comfortable
in
the
past
than
were
free
men
in
the
world
of
today
a
model
employer
might
by
his
regulations
greatly
increase
the
comfort
of
his
workers
and
yet
enslave
them
a
letter
from
bernard
shaw
advising
him
to
get
up
certain
details
asks
the
question
of
whether
the
workman
at
port
sunlight
would
forfeit
his
benefits
and
savings
should
he
leave
if
this
is
so
wrote
shaw
then
though
lever
may
treat
him
as
well
as
pickwick
would
no
doubt
have
treated
old
weller
if
he
had
consented
to
take
charge
of
his
savings
lever
is
master
of
his
employee
fate
and
captain
of
his
employee
soul
which
is
slavery
he
went
on
to
offer
financial
help
in
fighting
the
case
the
christian
commonweal
had
reported
chesterton
speech
and
was
also
threatened
with
the
law
to
the
editor
wrote
only
a
hasty
line
to
elongate
the
telephone
i
am
sorry
about
this
business
for
one
reason
only
and
that
is
that
you
should
be
even
indirectly
mixed
up
in
it
lever
can
sue
me
till
he
bursts
i
not
afraid
of
him
but
it
does
seem
a
shame
when
i
often
attacked
you
always
in
good
faith
and
what
was
meant
for
good
humour
and
when
you
heaped
coals
of
fire
by
printing
my
most
provocative
words
that
your
chivalry
should
get
you
even
bothered
about
it
i
am
truly
sorry
and
ask
pardon
of
you
but
not
of
old
sun
and
soapsuds
i
can
tell
you
another
very
hasty
line
about
the
way
i
shall
if
necessary
answer
about
which
i
feel
pretty
confident
i
should
say
it
is
absurd
to
have
libel
actions
about
controversies
instead
of
about
quarrels
it
would
mean
every
capitalist
being
prosecuted
for
saying
that
socialism
is
robbery
and
every
socialist
for
saying
property
is
theft
by
great
luck
the
example
lies
at
the
threshold
of
the
passage
quoted
the
worst
i
said
of
port
sunlight
was
that
it
was
a
why
that
was
the
very
phrase
about
which
half
the
governing
class
argued
with
the
other
half
a
few
years
ago
are
all
who
called
the
chinese
slaves
to
be
sued
by
all
who
did
am
i
prosecuted
for
a
terminology
enough
you
know
the
rest
go
on
with
the
passage
and
you
will
see
the
luck
continues
abrupt
brief
and
perhaps
abbreviated
as
my
platform
answer
was
it
really
does
contain
all
the
safeguards
against
imputing
cruelty
or
human
crime
to
poor
lever
it
defines
slavery
as
the
imposition
of
the
private
morality
as
in
the
matter
of
the
pubs
it
expressly
suggests
it
does
not
imply
cruelty
for
it
goes
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
such
slaves
may
be
better
off
under
such
slavery
so
they
were
physically
both
in
athens
and
carolina
it
then
says
that
a
merely
mystical
thing
which
i
think
is
christianity
makes
me
think
this
slavery
damnable
even
if
it
is
comfortable
i
would
defend
all
this
as
a
lawful
sociological
comment
in
any
court
in
civilisation
i
tell
you
my
line
of
defence
to
use
discreetly
and
at
your
discretion
if
the
other
side
are
bent
on
fighting
i
should
reserve
the
defence
if
they
seem
open
to
reason
i
should
point
out
that
it
is
on
our
side
his
old
schoolfellow
salter
was
also
his
solicitor
and
a
letter
to
wells
shows
in
part
the
advice
salter
gave
dear
wells
i
am
asked
to
make
a
suggestion
to
you
that
looks
like
and
indeed
is
infernal
impudence
but
which
a
further
examination
will
rob
of
most
of
its
terrors
let
not
these
terrors
be
redoubled
when
i
say
that
the
request
comes
from
my
solicitor
it
is
a
great
lark
i
am
writing
for
him
when
he
ought
to
be
writing
for
me
in
the
forthcoming
case
of
lever
chesterton
another
the
defendant
chesterton
will
conduct
his
own
case
as
his
heart
is
not
like
that
of
the
lady
in
the
song
another
he
wants
to
fight
it
purely
as
a
point
of
the
liberty
of
letters
and
public
speech
and
to
show
that
the
phrase
slavery
wherein
i
am
brought
in
question
is
current
in
the
educated
controversy
about
the
tendency
of
capitalism
today
the
solicitor
rather
to
my
surprise
approves
this
general
sociological
line
of
defence
and
says
that
i
may
be
allowed
one
or
two
witnesses
of
weight
and
sociological
standing
not
of
course
to
say
my
words
are
defensible
still
less
that
my
view
is
right
but
simply
to
say
that
the
servile
state
and
servile
terms
in
connection
with
it
are
known
to
them
as
parts
of
a
current
and
quite
unmalicious
controversy
he
has
suggested
your
name
and
when
i
have
written
this
i
have
done
my
duty
to
him
you
could
not
by
the
laws
of
evidence
be
asked
to
mix
yourself
up
with
my
remarks
on
lever
you
could
only
be
asked
if
at
all
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
disinterested
school
of
sociology
holding
that
capitalism
is
close
to
slavery
quite
apart
from
anybody
do
you
care
to
come
and
see
the
fun
yours
always
chesterton
the
suggested
line
was
so
successful
that
wells
testimony
was
not
called
for
the
case
was
withdrawn
no
apology
was
even
asked
from
gilbert
whose
solicitor
tells
me
that
messrs
lever
behaved
very
reasonably
when
once
it
was
made
clear
to
them
that
gilbert
was
not
a
scurrilous
person
making
a
vulgar
and
slanderous
attack
upon
their
business
with
wells
as
with
shaw
gilbert
relations
were
exceedingly
cordial
but
with
a
cordiality
occasionally
threatened
by
explosions
from
wells
gilbert
soft
answer
however
invariably
turned
away
wrath
and
all
was
well
again
no
one
wells
said
to
me
ever
had
enmity
for
him
except
some
literary
men
who
did
not
know
him
they
met
first
wells
thinks
at
the
hubert
blands
and
then
gilbert
stayed
with
wells
at
easton
there
they
played
at
the
game
of
gype
and
invented
elaborate
rules
for
it
cecil
came
too
and
they
played
the
war
game
wells
had
invented
cecil
says
wells
comparing
him
with
gilbert
seemed
condensed
not
quite
big
enough
for
a
real
chesterton
they
built
too
a
toy
theatre
at
easton
and
among
other
things
dramatized
the
minority
report
of
the
poor
law
commission
the
play
began
by
the
commissioners
taking
to
pieces
bumble
the
beadle
putting
him
into
a
huge
cauldron
and
stewing
him
then
out
from
the
cauldron
leaped
a
renewed
rejuvenated
bumble
several
sizes
larger
than
when
he
went
in
in
the
early
days
of
their
acquaintance
wells
remembers
meeting
the
whole
chesterton
family
in
the
street
of
a
french
town
and
inviting
them
to
lunch
his
own
youngest
son
a
small
boy
had
left
the
room
for
a
moment
when
wells
exclaimed
where
frank
good
god
gilbert
you
sitting
on
him
the
anxious
way
in
which
gilbert
got
up
and
turned
apologetically
towards
his
own
chair
was
unforgettable
an
man
who
in
a
gesture
of
politeness
once
gave
his
seat
to
three
ladies
in
a
bus
might
well
be
alarmed
over
the
fate
of
a
small
boy
found
under
him
in
his
memoirs
wells
relates
another
pleasing
story
of
a
chestertonian
encounter
i
once
saw
henry
james
quarrelling
with
his
brother
william
james
the
psychologist
he
had
lost
his
calm
he
was
terribly
unnerved
he
appealed
to
me
to
me
of
all
people
to
adjudicate
on
what
was
and
what
was
not
permissible
in
england
william
was
arguing
about
it
in
an
indisputably
american
accent
with
an
indecently
naked
reasonableness
i
had
come
to
rye
with
a
car
to
fetch
william
james
and
his
daughter
to
my
home
at
sandgate
william
had
none
of
passionate
regard
for
the
polish
upon
the
surface
of
life
and
he
was
immensely
excited
by
the
fact
that
in
the
little
rye
inn
which
had
its
garden
just
over
the
high
brick
wall
of
the
garden
of
lamb
house
chesterton
was
staying
william
james
had
corresponded
with
our
vast
contemporary
and
he
sorely
wanted
to
see
him
so
with
a
scandalous
directness
he
had
put
the
gardener
ladder
against
that
ripe
red
wall
and
clambered
up
and
peeped
over
henry
had
caught
him
at
it
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
done
it
was
most
emphatically
the
sort
of
thing
that
done
henry
instructed
the
gardener
to
put
away
that
ladder
and
william
was
looking
thoroughly
naughty
about
it
to
henry
manifest
relief
i
carried
william
off
and
in
the
road
just
outside
the
town
we
ran
against
the
chestertons
who
had
been
for
a
drive
in
romney
marsh
chesterton
was
heated
and
i
think
rather
swollen
by
the
sunshine
he
seemed
to
overhang
his
fly
he
descended
slowly
but
firmly
he
was
moist
and
steamy
but
cordial
we
chatted
in
the
road
and
william
got
his
coveted
impression
the
two
must
have
suited
each
other
a
good
deal
better
than
chesterton
and
the
more
conventional
brother
of
henry
reactions
there
was
a
comment
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
the
reported
that
henry
james
being
asked
on
a
visit
to
his
native
country
what
do
you
think
of
chesterton
in
england
replied
in
england
we
do
not
think
of
chesterton
the
commented
rather
neatly
this
of
our
compatriot
must
be
considered
as
either
mythical
or
editorial
unless
indeed
it
refers
to
that
small
and
exquisite
circle
which
immediately
surrounds
and
envelopes
him
in
his
gilbert
is
appreciative
but
amusing
describing
henry
james
reactions
to
the
arrival
of
belloc
from
a
walking
tour
unbrushed
unwashed
and
unshaven
after
reading
william
wrote
from
cambridge
mass
o
chesterton
but
you
a
darling
i
just
read
your
dickens

as
good
as

chesterton
god

that
i
should

indeed
i
am
not
and
of
all
the
joys
in

nothing
would
delight
me
more
than
a
controversy
with
whom
indeed
i
adore
here

a
tiny
wells
adoring
a
vast
chesterton
but
i
have
been
recklessly
promising
all
and
everyone
who
asks
me
to
lecture
or
debate
if
ever
i
do
so
again
it
will
be
for
you
and
if
once
i
break
the
vow
i
took
last
year
also
we
are
really
quite
in
agreement
it
a
mere
difference
in
fundamental

which
does

wells
frances
thought
wells
was
good
for
gilbert
he
tells
me
because
he
took
him
out
walking
but
when
the
two
men
were
alone
gilbert
would
say
supplicatingly
we
wo
go
for
a
walk
today
will
we
he
thought
it
terrifying
said
wells
the
way
my
wife
tidied
up
frances
too
tidied
up
but
cautiously
she
prevented
says
wells
from
becoming
too
physically
gross
he
ought
not
to
have
been
allowed
to
use
the
word
more
than
forty
times
a
day
he
could
not
wells
thought
have
gone
on
living
in
a
london
which
was
that
of
ordinary
social
life
whether
mayfair
or
bloomsbury
either
the
country
or
johnson
london
and
of
the
relation
seen
by
chesterton
between
liberty
and
conviviality
he
said
every
time
he
lifted
a
glass
of
wine
he
lifted
it
against
cadbury
in
spite
of
growing
restrictions
as
to
sales
and
hours
the
inn
still
remained
for
chesterton
a
symbol
of
freedom
in
a
world
increasingly
enslaved
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
how
great
a
peril
lay
in
drink
how
homes
were
broken
up
and
families
destroyed
through
drunkenness
after
the
war
began
a
letter
from
one
of
his
readers
stressed
a
real
danger
now
i
do
beg
you
chesterton
much
as
you
love
writing
in
praise
of
drink
to
give
it
a
rest
during
the
war
you
may
have
the
degradation
of
any
number
of
silly
boys
to
your
account
without
knowing
it
i
have
written
with
a
freedom
you
will
say
perhaps
rudeness
which
a
casual
meeting
with
you
and
a
great
admiration
for
your
work
by
no
means
justifies
but
which
other
things
perhaps
do
i
beg
you
to
forgive
me
it
seems
to
me
that
this
charge
he
never
quite
answered
to
claim
liberty
is
one
thing
to
hymn
the
glories
of
wine
is
quite
another
and
when
he
was
attacked
for
the
latter
he
always
defended
the
former
saying
that
he
did
not
deny
the
peril
but
that
all
freedom
meant
peril
peril
must
be
preferred
to
slavery
there
were
things
in
which
a
man
must
be
free
to
choose
even
if
his
choice
be
evil
this
was
a
part
of
chesterton
whole
philosophy
about
drink
a
subject
on
which
he
wrote
constantly
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
stages
of
its
development
in
his
mind
the
chesterton
family
had
not
a
puritan
tradition
in
the
sense
of
being
teetotal
but
lucian
oldershaw
tells
me
that
in
their
boyhood
he
always
felt
himself
to
be
a
bit
of
a
puritan
and
i
have
come
upon
a
boyish
poem
that
seems
to
confirm
this
in
the
matter
of
wine
the
tea
pot
raised
high
on
tripod
flashing
bright
the
holy
silver
urn
within
whose
inmost
cavern
dark
the
secret

burn
before
the

gateway
the
subject
bow
and
pass
it
steaming
with
thy
gift
thy
brown
autumnal
glow
within
thy
silver
fortress
the
treasure
piled
which
the
fiery
fountain
pours
its
waters
undefiled
till
the
steals
away
the
essence
they
enfold
and
dashes
from
the
yawning
spout
a
of
gold
then
fill
an
honest
cup
my
lads
and
quaff
the
draught
amain
and
lay
the
earthen
goblet
down
and
fill
it
yet
again
nor
heed
the
curses
on
the
cup
that
rise
from
folly
school
the
sneering
of
the
drunkard
and
the
warning
of
the
fool

to
the

remembers
gilbert
as
a
young
man
still
lunching
at
tea
shops
i
found
recently
two
versions
of
a
fragment
of
a
story
called
the
human
club
written
when
he
was
at
the
slade
school
the
second
version
opens
a
meal
was
spread
on
the
table
for
the
members
of
the
human
club
were
as
their
name
implies
human
however
glorified
and
transformed
the
meal
however
consisted
principally
of
tea
and
coffee
for
the
humans
were
total
abstainers
not
with
the
virulent
assertion
of
a
negative
formula
but
as
an
enlightened
ratification
of
a
profound
social
effort
hear
hear
not
as
the
meaningless
idolatry
cheers
of
an
isolated
nostrum
renewed
cheers
but
as
a
chivalrous
sacrifice
for
the
triumph
of
a
civic
morality
prolonged
cheers
and
uproar
the
aims
of
the
human
club
were
many
but
among
the
more
practical
and
immediate
was
the
entire
perfection
of
everything
perfection
is
impossible
said
the
host
eric
peterson
bowing
his
colossal
proportions
over
the
he
was
in
the
habit
of
showing
these
abrupt
rifts
of
his
train
of
thought
like
gigantic
fragments
of
a
frieze
but
he
said
then
quite
simply
with
no
change
in
his
bleak
blue
eyes
perfection
is
impossible
thank
god
the
impossible
is
the
eternal
we
are
a
long
way
from
tea
the
oriental
cocoa
the
vulgar
beast
and
wine
the
true
festivity
of
man
that
we
find
in
water
and
chesterton
had
meanwhile
discovered
the
peasants
of
france
and
italy
he
had
discovered
what
were
left
of
the
inns
of
england
where
cider
or
beer
are
drunk
by
the
sort
of
englishmen
he
had
come
to
love
best
the
poor
in
his
revolt
against
that
dreary
and
pretentious
element
that
he
most
hated
in
the
middle
classes
he
had
come
to
feel
that
the
life
of
the
poor
as
they
themselves
had
shaped
it
when
they
were
free
men
was
the
ideal
and
that
ideal
included
moderate
drinking
drinking
to
express
joy
in
life
and
to
increase
it
already
in
he
had
in
the
essay
called
omar
and
the
sacred
vine
attacked
the
evil
of
pessimistic
drinking
a
man
should
never
drink
because
he
is
miserable
he
will
be
wise
to
avoid
drink
as
a
medicine
for
health
being
a
normal
thing
he
will
tend
in
search
of
it
to
drink
too
much
but
no
man
expects
pleasure
all
the
time
so
if
he
drinks
for
pleasure
the
danger
of
excess
is
less
the
sound
rule
in
the
matter
would
appear
to
be
like
many
other
rules
a
paradox
drink
because
you
are
happy
but
never
because
you
are
miserable
never
drink
when
you
are
wretched
without
it
or
you
will
be
like
the
in
the
slum
but
drink
when
you
would
be
happy
without
it
and
you
will
be
like
the
laughing
peasants
of
italy
never
drink
because
you
need
it
for
this
is
rational
drinking
and
the
way
to
death
and
hell
but
drink
because
you
do
not
need
it
for
this
is
irrational
drinking
and
the
ancient
health
of
the
world

p
but
the
human
will
must
be
brought
into
action
and
the
gifts
of
god
must
be
taken
with
the
thanksgiving
that
is
restraint
we
must
thank
god
for
beer
and
burgundy
by
not
drinking
too
much
of
them
the
topic
seemed
to
fascinate
him
he
returned
to
it
again
and
again
in
one
essay
he
described
himself
opening
all
the
windows
in
a
private
bar
to
get
rid
of
the
air
of
secrecy
that
he
hated
wine
should
be
taken
not
secretly
but
frankly
and
in
fellowship
as
men
in
inns
do
dine
cocktails
he
abominated
and
in
fact
strong
spirits
were
almost
as
evil
as
wine
and
beer
were
good
in
an
essay
the
cowardice
of
cocktails
he
is
especially
scathing
in
his
comment
on
those
who
urge
that
they
give
a
man
an
appetite
for
his
meals
from
on
new
london
newer
york
p
this
is
unworthy
of
a
generation
that
is
always
claiming
to
be
candid
and
courageous
in
the
second
aspect
it
is
utterly
unworthy
of
a
generation
that
claims
to
keep
itself
fit
by
tennis
and
golf
and
all
sorts
of
athletics
what
are
these
athletes
worth
if
after
all
their
athletics
they
can
not
scratch
up
such
a
thing
as
a
natural
appetite
most
of
my
own
work
is
i
will
not
venture
to
say
literary
but
at
least
sedentary
i
never
do
anything
except
walk
about
and
throw
clubs
and
javelins
in
the
garden
but
i
never
require
anything
to
give
me
an
appetite
for
a
meal
i
never
yet
needed
a
tot
of
rum
to
help
me
to
go
over
the
top
and
face
the
mortal
perils
of
luncheon
quite
rationally
considered
there
has
been
a
decline
and
degradation
in
these
things
first
came
the
old
drinking
days
which
are
always
described
as
much
more
healthy
in
those
days
men
worked
or
played
hunted
or
herded
or
ploughed
or
fished
or
even
in
their
rude
way
wrote
or
spoke
if
only
expressing
the
simple
minds
of
socrates
or
shakespeare
and
got
reasonably
drunk
in
the
evening
when
their
work
was
done
we
find
the
first
step
of
the
degradation
when
men
do
not
drink
when
their
work
is
done
but
drink
in
order
to
do
their
work

to
drink
nips
of
neat
whisky
to
enable
them
to
face
life
in
the
progressive
and
scientific
factory
but
at
least
it
may
be
admitted
that
life
in
the
factory
was
something
that
it
took
some
courage
to
face
these
men
felt
they
had
to
take
an
anaesthetic
before
they
could
face
pain
what
are
we
to
say
of
those
who
have
to
take
an
anaesthetic
before
they
can
face
pleasure
what
of
those
who
when
faced
with
the
terrors
of
mayonnaise
eggs
or
sardines
can
only
utter
a
faint
cry
for
brandy
what
of
those
who
have
to
be
drugged
maddened
inspired
and
intoxicated
to
the
point
of
partaking
of
meals
like
the
assassins
to
the
point
of
committing
murders
if
as
they
say
the
use
of
the
drug
means
the
increase
of
the
dose
where
will
it
stop
and
at
what
precise
point
of
frenzy
and
delusion
will
a
healthy
man
be
ready
to
rush
headlong
upon
a
cutlet
or
make
a
dash
for
death
or
glory
at
a
this
is
obviously
the
most
abject
stage
of
all
worse
than
that
of
the
man
who
drinks
for
the
sake
of
work
and
much
worse
than
that
of
the
man
who
drinks
for
the
sake
of
play
wine
chesterton
maintained
should
not
be
drunk
as
an
aid
to
creative
production
yet
one
may
find
that
increased
power
of
creation
sometimes
follows
in
its
wake
and
here
of
course
was
a
danger
to
a
man
who
worked
as
hard
as
chesterton
he
sometimes
spoke
of
himself
as
idle
but
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
match
either
his
output
or
his
hours
of
creative
work
i
remember
one
visit
that
i
paid
to
beaconsfield
when
he
was
writing
one
of
his
major
books
he
was
in
his
study
by
in
the
morning
emerged
for
lunch
at
and
went
back
from
about
to
after
tea
he
worked
again
until
a
dinner
his
wife
and
i
went
to
bed
about
leaving
him
preparing
his
material
for
the
next
day
towards
a
ponderous
tread
as
he
passed
my
door
on
his
way
to
bed
woke
me
to
a
general
impression
of
an
earthquake
in
a
passage
in
makes
his
hero
say
i
happen
to
have
what
is
called
a
strong
head
and
i
have
never
been
really
drunk
it
was
true
of
himself
but
in
these
years
just
before
the
great
war
before
his
own
severe
illness
intimate
friends
have
told
me
that
they
had
seen
him
unlike
himself
that
they
felt
he
had
come
to
depend
almost
one
said
on
the
stimulus
of
wine
for
the
sheer
physical
power
to
pour
forth
so
much
besides
overwork
was
in
these
years
mentally
oppressed
by
the
strain
of
the
marconi
case
and
then
almost
overwhelmed
by
the
horror
of
the
world
war
a
man
very
tender
of
heart
sensitive
and
intensely
imaginative
he
could
not
react
as
calmly
as
cecil
himself
did
to
what
both
believed
the
probability
of
the
latter
imprisonment
and
when
that
strain
was
removed
there
remained
the
stain
on
national
honour
the
opening
gulf
into
which
he
saw
his
country
falling
to
him
the
marconi
case
was
a
heavier
burden
than
the
war
for
as
he
saw
it
in
the
marconi
case
the
nation
was
wrong
in
enduring
corruption
and
in
the
war
the
nation
was
magnificently
right
in
resisting
tyranny
so
chesterton
felt
yet
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
all
its
human
suffering
to
mind
and
body
weighed
heavily
upon
him
too
he
wrote
barbarism
of
of
which
i
will
say
something
in
the
next
chapter
for
it
belongs
to
those
writings
of
the
war
period
the
series
of
which
is
so
consistent
that
in
his
he
was
able
to
claim
that
he
had
no
sympathy
with
the
rather
reaction
that
is
going
on
round
us
at
the
first
outbreak
of
the
war
i
attended
the
conference
of
all
the
english
men
of
letters
called
together
to
compose
a
reply
to
the
manifesto
of
the
german
professors
i
at
least
among
all
those
writers
can
say
i
have
written
i
have
written
then
his
illness
came
upon
him
pocock
coming
for
a
first
visit
found
the
bed
partly
broken
under
the
weight
of
the
patient
who
was
lying
in
a
grotesquely
awkward
position
his
hips
higher
than
his
head
you
must
be
horribly
uncomfortable
he
said
why
now
you
mention
it
said
like
a
man
receiving
a
new
idea
i
suppose
i
am
the
doctor
ordered
a
and
almost
the
last
words
he
heard
before
the
patient
sank
into
coma
were
i
wonder
if
this
bally
ship
will
ever
get
to
shore
the
illness
lasted
several
months
we
can
follow
its
progress
and
his
in
extracts
from
written
to
father
by
frances
you
must
pray
for
him
he
is
seriously
ill
and
i
have
two
nurses
it
is
mostly
but
there
are
complications
he
is
quite
his
normal
self
as
to
head
and
brain
and
he
even
dictates
and
reads
a
great
deal
gilbert
had
a
bad
relapse
on
christmas
eve
and
now
is
being
desperately
ill
he
is
not
often
conscious
and
is
so
weak
i
feel
he
might
ask
for
you
if
so
i
shall
wire
is
still
hopeful
but
i
feel
in
despair
if
you
came
he
would
not
know
you
and
this
condition
may
last
some
time
the
brain
is
dormant
and
must
be
kept
so
if
he
is
sufficiently
conscious
at
any
moment
to
understand
i
will
ask
him
to
let
you
come
or
will
send
on
my
own
responsibility
pray
for
his
soul
and
mine
gilbert
seemed
decidedly
clearer
yesterday
and
though
not
quite
so
well
today
the
doctor
says
he
has
reason
to
hope
the
mental
trouble
is
working
off
his
heart
is
stronger
and
he
is
able
to
take
plenty
of
nourishment
under
the
circumstances
therefore
i
am
hoping
and
praying
he
may
soon
be
sufficiently
himself
to
tell
us
what
he
wants
done
i
am
dreadfully
unhappy
at
not
knowing
how
he
would
wish
me
to
act
his
parents
would
never
forgive
me
if
i
acted
only
on
my
own
authority
i
do
pray
to
god
he
will
restore
him
to
himself
that
we
may
know
i
feel
in
his
mercy
he
will
even
if
death
is
the
end
of
it
or
the
beginning
shall
i
say
he
is
really
better
i
believe
and
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
dare
hope
he
is
to
be
restored
to
us
physically
he
is
stronger
and
the
brain
is
beginning
to
work
normally
and
soon
i
trust
we
shall
be
able
to
ask
him
his
wishes
with
regard
to
the
church
i
am
so
thankful
to
think
that
we
can
get
at
his
desire
in
january
frances
wrote
to
my
mother
gilbert
remains
much
the
same
in
a
condition
sleeping
a
great
deal
i
feel
absolutely
hopeless
it
seems
impossible
it
can
go
on
like
this
the
impossibility
of
reaching
him
is
too
terrible
an
experience
and
i
do
know
how
to
go
through
with
it
i
pray
for
strength
and
you
must
pray
for
me
dearest
josephine
she
wrote
in
a
later
undated
letter
gilbert
is
today
a
little
better
after
being
practically
at
a
standstill
for
the
past
week
he
asked
for
me
today
which
is
a
great
advance
and
hugged
me
i
feel
like
elijah
was
it
and
shall
go
in
the
strength
of
that
hug
forty
days
the
recovery
will
be
very
slow
the
doctors
tell
me
and
we
have
to
prevent
his
using
his
brain
at
all
in
this
letter
she
begged
to
see
my
mother
and
i
remember
when
they
met
she
told
her
that
one
day
she
had
tried
to
test
whether
gilbert
was
conscious
by
asking
him
who
is
looking
after
you
he
answered
very
gravely
and
i
felt
so
small
she
said
presently
frances
told
my
mother
that
gilbert
had
talked
to
her
about
coming
into
the
catholic
church
it
was
just
at
this
time
that
she
wrote
to
tell
father
that
gilbert
said
to
her
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
die
and
followed
this
with
the
question
does
father
know
after
her
conversation
with
my
mother
frances
wrote
to
her
march
i
think
i
would
rather
you
did
not
tell
anyone
just
yet
of
what
i
told
you
regarding
my
husband
and
the
catholic
church
not
that
i
doubt
for
a
moment
that
he
meant
it
and
knew
what
he
was
saying
and
was
relieved
at
saying
it
but
i
do
want
the
world
at
large
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
came
to
this
decision
when
he
was
weak
and
unlike
himself
he
will
ratify
it
no
doubt
when
his
complete
manhood
is
restored
i
know
it
was
not
weakness
that
made
him
say
it
but
you
will
understand
my
scruples
i
know
in
god
good
time
he
will
make
his
confession
of
faith
and
if
death
comes
near
him
again
i
shall
know
how
to
act
thanks
for
all
your
sympathy
i
enjoy
seeing
you
on
easter
eve
frances
wrote
two
letters
one
to
father
one
to
my
mother
to
father
she
said
all
goes
well
here
though
still
very
very
slowly
g
mind
is
gradually
clearing
but
it
is
still
difficult
to
him
to
distinguish
between
the
real
and
the
unreal
i
am
quite
sure
he
will
soon
be
able
to
think
and
act
for
himself
but
i
dare
not
hurry
matters
at
all
i
have
told
him
i
am
writing
to
you
often
and
he
said
that
is
right
i
see
him
soon
i
want
to
talk
to
him
he
wanders
at
times
but
the
clear
intervals
are
longer
he
repeated
the
creed
last
night
this
time
in
english
to
my
mother
i
feel
the
enormous
significance
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
when
i
think
of
my
dear
husband
just
consciously
laying
hold
of
life
again
indeed
i
will
pray
that
your
dear
ones
may
be
kept
in
safety
god
bless
you
for
all
your
sympathy
i
am
so
glad
that
decision
for
i
am
sure
it
was
a
decision
has
made
you
so
happy
i
dare
not
hurry
anything
the
least
little
excitement
upsets
him
last
night
he
said
the
creed
and
asked
me
to
read
parts
of
myers
st
paul
he
still
wanders
a
good
deal
when
tired
but
is
certainly
a
little
stronger
love
and
easter
blessings
to
you
all
we
ourselves
were
passing
then
through
the
shadow
of
death
almost
as
gilbert
rose
again
to
this
life
my
father
passed
into
life
eternal
one
of
the
very
few
letters
i
possess
in
gilbert
own
handwriting
was
also
one
of
the
first
he
wrote
on
recovery
it
was
to
my
mother
i
fear
i
have
delayed
writing
to
you
and
partly
with
a
vague
feeling
that
i
might
so
find
some
way
of
saying
what
i
feel
on
your
behalf
and
others
and
of
course
it
has
not
come
somewhat
of
what
the
world
and
a
wider
circle
of
friends
have
lost
i
shall
try
to
say
in
the
by
the
kindness
of
monsignor
barnes
who
has
invited
me
to
contribute
to
it
but
of
all
i
feel
and
frances
feels
and
of
the
happy
times
we
have
had
in
your
house
i
despair
of
saying
anything
at
all
i
can
only
hope
you
and
yours
will
be
able
to
read
between
the
lines
of
what
i
write
either
here
or
there
and
understand
that
the
simultaneous
losses
of
a
good
friend
and
a
fine
intellect
have
a
way
of
stunning
rather
than
helping
the
expression
of
either
i
would
say
i
am
glad
he
lived
to
see
what
i
feel
to
be
a
rebirth
of
england
if
his
mere
presence
in
an
older
generation
did
not
prove
to
me
that
england
never
died
this
sense
of
the
rebirth
of
england
gave
to
gilbert
restored
life
a
special
quality
of
triumph
that
abode
down
to
the
end
of
the
war
chapter
xxi
the
war
years
gilbert
was
taking
up
life
again
and
with
it
the
old
friendships
and
the
old
debates
in
the
new
atmosphere
created
by
the
war
to
bernard
shaw
he
wrote
june
my
dear
bernard
shaw
i
ought
to
have
written
to
you
a
long
time
ago
to
thank
you
for
your
kind
letter
which
i
received
when
i
had
recovered
and
still
more
for
many
other
kindnesses
that
seem
to
have
come
from
you
during
the
time
before
the
recovery
i
am
not
a
vegetarian
and
i
am
only
in
a
very
comparative
sense
a
skeleton
indeed
i
am
afraid
you
must
reconcile
yourself
to
the
dismal
prospect
of
my
being
more
or
less
like
what
i
was
before
and
any
resumption
of
my
ordinary
habits
must
necessarily
include
the
habit
of
disagreeing
with
you
what
and
where
and
when
is
uncommon
sense
about
the
war
how
can
i
get
hold
of
it
i
do
not
merely
ask
as
one
hungry
for
hostilities
but
also
as
one
unusually
hungry
for
good
literature
il
me
faut
des
géants
as
cyrano
says
so
i
naturally
wish
to
hear
the
last
about
you
you
probably
know
that
i
do
not
agree
with
you
about
the
war
i
do
not
think
it
is
going
on
of
its
own
momentum
i
think
it
is
going
on
in
accordance
with
that
logical
paradox
whereby
the
thing
that
is
most
difficult
to
do
is
also
the
thing
that
must
be
done
if
it
were
an
easy
war
to
end
it
would
have
been
a
wicked
war
to
begin
if
a
cat
has
nine
lives
one
must
kill
it
nine
times
saving
your
humanitarian
feelings
and
always
supposing
it
is
a
witch
cat
and
really
draws
its
powers
from
hell
i
have
always
thought
that
there
was
in
prussia
an
evil
will
i
would
not
have
made
it
a
ground
for
going
to
war
but
i
was
quite
sure
of
it
long
before
there
was
any
war
at
all
but
i
suppose
we
shall
some
day
have
an
opportunity
of
arguing
about
all
that
meanwhile
my
thanks
and
good
wishes
are
as
sincere
as
my
opinions
and
i
do
not
think
those
are
insincere
yours
always
sincerely
chesterton
bernard
shaw
replied
june
my
dear
chesterton
i
am
delighted
to
learn
under
your
own
hand
that
you
have
recovered
all
your
health
and
powers
with
an
unimpaired
figure
you
have
also
the
gratification
of
knowing
that
you
have
carried
out
a
theory
of
mine
that
every
man
of
genius
has
a
critical
illness
at
object
being
to
make
him
go
to
bed
for
several
months
sometimes
nature
overdoes
it
schiller
and
mozart
died
goethe
survived
though
he
very
nearly
followed
schiller
into
the
shades
i
did
the
thing
myself
quite
handsomely
by
spending
eighteen
months
on
crutches
having
two
surgical
operations
and
breaking
my
arm
i
distinctly
noticed
that
instead
of
my
recuperation
beginning
when
my
breakdown
ended
it
began
before
that
the
ascending
curve
cut
through
the
tail
of
the
descending
one
and
i
was
consummating
my
collapse
and
rising
for
my
next
flight
simultaneously
it
is
perfectly
useless
for
you
to
try
to
differ
with
me
about
the
war
nobody
can
differ
with
me
about
the
war
you
might
as
well
differ
from
the
almighty
about
the
orbit
of
the
sun
i
have
got
the
war
right
and
to
that
complexion
you
too
must
come
at
last
your
nature
not
being
a
fundamentally
erroneous
one
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
great
pity
you
were
not
born
in
ireland
you
would
have
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
the
burning
patriotism
of
your
native
land
expressing
itself
by
saying
exactly
the
same
things
about
england
that
english
patriotism
now
says
about
prussia
and
of
recognizing
that
though
they
were
entirely
true
they
were
also
a
very
great
nuisance
as
they
prevented
people
from
building
the
future
by
conscientious
thought
also
cecil
would
have
seen
what
the
catholic
church
is
really
like
when
the
apostolic
succession
falls
to
the
farmer
son
who
is
cleverer
with
school
books
than
with
agricultural
implements
in
fact
you
would
have
learned
a
devil
of
a
lot
of
things
for
lack
of
which
you
often
drive
me
to
exclaim
gilbert
gilbert
why
persecutest
thou
me
as
to
the
evil
will
of
course
there
is
an
evil
will
in
prussia
prussia
is
paradise
i
have
been
fighting
that
evil
will
in
myself
and
others
all
my
life
it
is
the
will
of
the
brave
barabbas
and
of
the
militant
nationalists
who
admired
him
and
crucified
the
but
the
prussians
must
save
their
own
souls
they
also
have
their
shaws
and
chestertons
and
a
divine
spark
in
them
for
these
to
work
on
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
make
ridiculous
the
cry
of
vengeance
is
mine
saith
podsnap
and
whenever
anyone
tells
an
englishman
a
lie
to
explain
to
the
poor
devil
that
it
is
a
lie
and
that
he
must
stop
cheering
it
as
a
splendid
speech
for
an
englishman
never
compares
speeches
either
with
facts
or
with
previous
speeches
to
him
a
speech
is
art
for
art
sake
the
disciples
of
our
favoured
politicians
being
really
if
they
only
knew
it
disciples
of
whistler
also
and
equally
important
we
have
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
english
genius
does
not
like
the
german
lie
in
disciplined
idealism
the
englishman
is
an
anarchist
and
a
grumbler
he
has
no
such
word
as
fatherland
and
the
idea
which
he
supposes
corresponds
to
it
is
nothing
but
the
swing
of
a
roaring
chorus
to
a
patriotic
song
also
he
is
a
muddler
and
a
slacker
because
tense
and
continuous
work
means
thought
and
he
is
lazy
and
fat
in
the
head
but
as
long
as
he
is
himself
and
grumbles
it
does
not
matter
given
a
furious
opposition
screaming
for
the
disgrace
of
tyrannical
and
corrupt
ministers
and
a
press
on
the
very
verge
of
inviting
napoleon
to
enter
london
in
triumph
and
deliver
a
groaning
land
from
the
intolerable
burden
of
its
native
rulers
incapacity
and
rapacity
and
obsolescence
and
the
departments
will
work
as
well
as
the
departments
perhaps
better
and
the
government
will
have
to
keep
its
wits
at
full
pressure
but
once
let
england
try
what
she
is
trying
now
that
is
to
combine
the
devoted
silence
and
obedience
of
the
german
system
with
the
slack
and
muddle
of
coodle
and
doodle
and
we
are
lost
unless
you
keep
up
as
hot
a
fire
from
your
on
the
government
as
the
soldier
keeps
up
from
the
trenches
you
are
betraying
that
soldier
of
course
they
will
call
you
a
what
of
that
they
call
me
a
we
also
must
stand
fire
as
peer
gynt
said
of
hell
if
the
torture
is
only
moral
it
can
not
be
so
very
bad
i
grieve
to
say
that
some
fool
has
stolen
my
title
and
issued
a
two
page
pamphlet
called
uncommon
sense
about
the
war
so
i
shall
have
to
call
mine
more
common
sense
about
the
war
it
is
not
yet
in
type
i
have
yet
quite
settled
its
destination
any
chance
of
seeing
you
both
if
we
drive
over
from
ayot
to
beaconsfield
some
sunday
or
other
afternoon
yours
ever
wells
too
was
rejoicing
over
his
recovery
dear
old
i
so
delighted
to
get
a
letter
from
you
again
as
soon
as
i
can
i
will
come
to
beaconsfield
and
see
you
i
absurdly
busy
in
bringing
together
the
rulers
of
the
country
and
the
scientific
people
of
whom
they
are
totally
ignorant
lloyd
george
has
never
heard
of
ramsey
and
so
on
and
the
hash
and
muddle
and
quackery
on
our
technical
side
is
appalling
it
all
means
boys
lives
in
flanders
and
horrible
waste
and
suffering
well
anyhow
if
we
got
only
obscure
and
cramped
and
underpaid
scientific
men
we
have
a
bench
of
fine
fat
bishops
and
no
end
of
tremendous
lawyers
one
of
the
best
ideas
for
the
ypres
position
came
from
robert
mond
but
the
execution
was
too
difficult
for
our
officers
to
attempt
so
we
got
a
row
of
wounded
and
mangled
men
that
would
reach
from
beaconsfield
to
great
marlow
just
to
show
we
do
take
stock
in
these
damned
scientific
people
yours
ever
no
one
however
mad
could
have
called
gilbert
a
it
was
perhaps
the
only
accusation
the
escaped
but
while
he
largely
agreed
with
shaw
analysis
of
the
englishman
as
a
natural
anarchist
and
grumbler
while
he
believed
in
the
voluntary
principle
and
disliked
conscription
his
general
outlook
was
as
different
from
shaw
as
were
the
pamphlets
they
both
wrote
in
a
book
addressed
to
a
german
professor
frankly
confessed
the
real
of
for
which
she
was
now
making
reparation
to
any
englishman
living
in
the
native
atmosphere
the
suggestion
that
england
had
been
preparing
an
aggression
against
germany
seemed
more
than
faintly
ludicrous
we
were
not
engaged
in
plotting
in
europe
on
the
contrary
we
were
far
too
careless
of
europe
and
the
funds
of
the
liberal
party
which
was
in
power
actually
depended
chiefly
on
quaker
millionaires
who
were
noted
pacifists
and
at
whose
bidding
national
honour
was
jeopardised
by
our
delay
in
declaring
our
support
of
france
we
were
not
prepared
for
war
and
probably
only
the
shock
of
the
invasion
of
belgium
made
certain
our
stand
with
france
it
may
seem
an
idle
contradiction
to
say
that
our
strength
in
this
war
came
from
not
being
prepared
but
there
is
a
truth
that
can
not
be
otherwise
expressed
the
strongest
thing
in
sane
anger
is
surprise
if
we
had
time
to
think
we
might
have
thought
better
that
is
worse
everything
that
could
be
instinctive
managed
to
be
strong
the
instant
fury
of
contempt
with
which
the
better
spirit
in
our
rulers
flung
back
the
prussian
bribe
the
instant
solidarity
of
all
parties
above
all
the
brilliant
instinct
by
which
the
irish
leader
cast
into
the
scale
of
a
free
europe
the
ancient
sword
of
ireland
uses
of
our
crimes
were
in
the
past
not
the
present
the
first
had
been
when
we
gave
aid
to
prussia
against
austria
austria
which
was
not
a
nation
but
a
kind
of
empire
a
holy
roman
empire
that
never
came
which
still
retained
something
of
the
old
catholic
comfort
for
the
soul
we
had
helped
to
put
prussia
instead
of
austria
at
the
head
of
the
germanies
prussia
which
in
the
person
of
frederick
the
great
hated
everything
german
and
everything
good
francophile
as
chesterton
was
he
yet
had
a
certain
tenderness
for
those
old
germanies
which
preserved
the
good
things
that
go
with
small
interests
and
strict
boundaries
music
etiquette
a
dreamy
philosophy
and
so
on
our
next
crimes
had
been
in
calling
prussia
to
our
aid
against
napoleon
and
in
failing
to
assist
denmark
against
her
and
by
far
our
worst
had
been
the
using
of
prussian
mercenaries
with
their
ghastly
tradition
of
cruelty
in
ireland
in
the
there
is
in
this
little
book
one
drawback
from
the
historian
point
of
view
its
view
of
the
past
is
so
oddly
selective
doubtless
it
is
lawful
to
examine
your
own
nation
conscience
as
you
do
your
own
and
not
your
neighbour
yet
history
should
be
rather
an
examination
of
facts
than
an
examination
of
conscience
and
historically
richelieu
policies
had
had
quite
something
to
say
in
the
creation
of
prussia
the
conscript
armies
of
the
french
revolution
had
first
made
europe
into
an
armed
camp
it
was
an
undue
simplification
to
insist
exclusively
on
the
crimes
of
england
but
even
while
he
did
so
chesterton
rejoiced
that
now
at
long
last
england
was
on
the
right
side
on
the
side
of
europe
and
of
sanity
the
group
had
always
seen
the
issue
as
their
countrymen
were
now
suddenly
beginning
to
see
it
they
had
no
sympathy
with
the
liberal
thinking
made
in
germany
that
had
in
the
name
of
biblical
and
historical
criticism
been
undermining
the
bases
of
christianity
their
love
of
logic
and
of
clarity
had
made
german
philosophy
intolerable
to
them
it
was
wind
and
it
was
fog
finally
their
love
of
france
had
always
made
them
conceive
of
europe
as
centering
in
that
country
for
them
there
was
one
profound
satisfaction
even
amid
the
horrors
of
war
that
the
issues
were
so
clear
but
were
they
as
clear
to
the
whole
world
if
not
they
must
be
made
so
there
were
two
main
problems
to
be
overcome
in
this
matter
one
of
which
was
less
pronounced
at
the
time
than
it
became
later
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
started
by
karl
marx
the
idea
that
all
history
can
be
interpreted
solely
by
economic
causes
has
come
since
to
have
an
extraordinary
popularity
even
among
those
whose
own
philosophy
and
sociology
are
most
widely
removed
from
marx
it
is
a
view
which
chesterton
would
always
have
dismissed
with
the
contempt
it
deserves
both
he
and
belloc
saw
as
the
determining
factor
in
history
because
it
is
the
determining
factor
in
human
life
the
free
will
of
man
this
does
not
mean
that
they
would
deny
that
the
economic
factor
has
often
been
powerful
in
conquering
man
liberty
or
a
motive
in
its
exercise
but
chesterton
regarded
the
present
age
as
a
diseased
one
precisely
because
the
money
motive
held
so
disproportionate
a
place
in
it
he
looked
back
to
the
past
and
saw
the
world
of
today
as
almost
unique
in
that
respect
he
looked
forward
to
the
future
and
hoped
for
a
release
from
it
and
as
he
looked
back
into
the
past
he
saw
something
in
the
history
of
mankind
far
stronger
than
the
economic
motive
whether
that
mean
the
strife
for
wealth
or
the
mere
struggle
for
subsistence
he
saw
the
power
of
religion
which
in
bygone
ages
had
presided
over
man
activities
and
turned
the
exercise
of
that
most
noble
faculty
to
the
building
of
a
civilization
today
undreamed
of
but
in
it
was
easier
to
get
away
from
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
than
it
was
to
overcome
another
difficulty
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
not
the
chesterton
vision
of
europe
and
to
whom
it
seemed
that
in
a
war
between
nations
it
was
extremely
likely
that
all
parties
were
more
or
less
equally
to
blame
history
said
chesterton
tends
to
be
a
façade
of
faded
picturesqueness
for
most
of
those
who
have
not
specially
studied
it
a
more
or
less
monochrome
background
for
the
drama
of
their
own
day
but
the
nature
of
that
background
and
the
vision
of
today
drama
will
vary
with
the
varying
angle
of
historic
vision
there
were
two
possible
meanings
for
the
statement
that
all
nations
were
to
blame
for
the
world
war
all
nations
had
gone
away
from
god
motives
of
personal
and
national
greed
had
ousted
the
old
ideal
of
christendom
it
might
roughly
be
said
that
no
nation
was
seriously
trying
to
seek
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
justice
international
finance
had
become
a
shadow
resting
on
all
the
earth
and
it
could
not
have
got
this
power
if
governments
had
been
governing
solely
for
the
good
of
their
peoples
bow
down
your
heads
before
god
is
the
invocation
constantly
used
in
the
missal
during
the
penitential
season
of
lent
and
the
government
of
every
nation
needed
this
call
to
repentance
with
this
interpretation
chesterton
would
have
agreed
all
nations
were
to
blame
for
the
predisposing
causes
that
made
a
possible
but
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
actual
responsibility
for
making
this
particular
war
the
statement
means
something
very
different
and
something
with
which
chesterton
was
prepared
to
join
issue
against
him
those
who
disliked
france
or
england
and
saw
the
history
of
those
two
countries
as
a
history
of
imperialism
were
saying
if
germany
had
not
attacked
france
france
would
have
attacked
germany
or
england
would
have
been
equally
treacherous
if
it
had
paid
her
look
at
the
treaty
of
limerick
chesterton
kept
imploring
people
simply
to
look
at
the
facts
germany
had
in
fact
broken
her
word
to
france
and
attacked
her
france
had
not
attacked
germany
germany
had
invaded
belgium
england
had
not
invaded
holland
to
seize
a
naval
and
commercial
advantage
and
whether
they
say
that
we
wished
to
do
it
in
our
greed
or
feared
to
do
it
in
our
cowardice
the
fact
remains
that
we
did
not
do
it
unless
this
principle
be
kept
in
view
i
can
not
conceive
how
any
quarrel
can
possibly
be
judged
a
contract
may
be
made
between
two
persons
solely
for
material
advantage
on
each
side
but
the
moral
advantage
is
still
generally
supposed
to
lie
with
the
person
who
keeps
the
contract
barbarism
of
the
promise
and
the
vow
were
fundamental
to
chesterton
view
of
human
life
discussing
divorce
he
claims
as
essential
to
manhood
the
right
to
bind
oneself
and
to
be
taken
at
one
word
the
marriage
vow
was
almost
the
only
vow
that
remained
out
of
the
whole
mediaeval
conception
of
chivalry
and
he
could
not
endure
to
see
it
set
at
nought
but
even
in
the
modern
world
there
still
remained
some
notion
of
the
sacredness
of
a
solemn
promise
it
is
plain
that
the
promise
or
extension
of
responsibility
through
time
is
what
chiefly
distinguishes
us
i
will
not
say
from
savages
but
from
brutes
and
reptiles
this
was
noted
by
the
shrewdness
of
the
old
testament
when
it
summed
up
the
dark
irresponsible
enormity
of
leviathan
in
the
words
he
make
a
pact
with
thee
the
vow
is
to
the
man
what
the
song
is
to
the
bird
or
the
bark
to
the
dog
his
voice
whereby
he
is
known
there
were
two
chief
marks
whereby
it
seemed
to
chesterton
that
the
prussian
invasion
of
belgium
was
fundamentally
an
attack
on
civilization
contempt
for
a
promise
was
the
first
he
called
it
the
war
on
the
word
the
other
mark
of
barbarism
he
called
the
refusal
of
reciprocity
the
prussians
he
wrote
had
been
told
by
their
literary
men
that
everything
depends
upon
mood
and
by
their
politicians
that
all
arrangements
dissolve
before
this
was
not
merely
a
contempt
for
the
word
but
also
an
assumption
that
german
necessity
was
like
no
other
necessity
because
the
german
can
not
get
outside
the
idea
that
he
because
he
is
he
and
not
you
is
free
to
break
the
law
and
also
to
appeal
to
the
law
thus
the
kaiser
at
once
violated
the
hague
convention
openly
himself
and
wrote
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
complain
that
the
allies
were
violating
it
for
this
principle
of
a
quite
unproved
racial
supremacy
is
the
last
and
worst
of
the
refusals
of
reciprocity
p
if
these
two
ideas
were
allowed
to
prevail
they
must
destroy
civilization
and
so
to
chesterton
the
war
was
a
crusade
and
to
his
profound
joy
was
understood
as
such
by
the
people
of
england
the
democratic
spirit
of
our
country
is
rather
unusually
sluggish
and
far
below
the
surface
and
the
most
genuine
and
purely
popular
movement
that
we
have
had
since
the
chartists
has
been
the
enlistment
for
this
war
chesterton
loved
the
heroic
humour
of
the
trenches
the
cry
of
early
doors
from
the
boys
rushing
on
death
the
term
blighty
for
england
and
congratulations
on
a
severe
wound
as
a
good
blighty
one
the
song
under
showers
of
bullets
when
it
raining
keep
your
umbrella
up
the
english
he
once
said
had
no
religion
left
except
their
sense
of
humour
but
i
think
he
meant
that
they
hung
out
humour
somewhat
defiantly
as
a
for
other
things
anyhow
he
doubted
neither
that
the
war
was
worth
winning
nor
that
it
could
be
won
by
our
soldiers
and
sailors
and
with
the
soldiers
and
sailors
stood
the
munition
workers
and
the
trades
unions
which
had
sacrificed
their
cherished
rights
for
the
war
period
if
the
only
danger
to
england
was
on
the
home
front
it
was
not
in
his
eyes
to
be
found
in
the
mass
of
the
nation
nor
was
he
at
first
too
apprehensive
of
the
actions
of
the
government
asquith
and
sir
edward
grey
might
have
been
slow
in
declaring
war
but
both
were
patriotic
englishmen
and
with
them
stood
with
equal
patriotism
the
mass
of
the
governing
classes
if
as
has
later
been
said
the
war
had
really
been
brought
about
by
english
political
and
financial
interests
it
is
strange
that
lord
desborough
head
of
the
london
house
of
morgan
and
a
leading
financier
of
england
should
have
lost
his
two
elder
sons
and
the
prime
minister
his
eldest
but
the
did
see
two
dangers
at
home
which
might
jeopardise
the
success
of
our
armies
in
the
field
and
bring
about
a
premature
and
dishonourable
peace
these
were
international
finance
and
the
press
magnates
nothing
so
reminds
me
of
how
we
were
all
feeling
about
the
daily
papers
just
then
as
finding
this
letter
to
bentley
dated
july
i
was
delighted
to
hear
from
you
though
very
sorry
to
hear
you
have
been
bad
i
mean
physically
bad
morally
and
intellectually
you
have
evidently
been
very
good
seriously
i
think
you
have
done
something
to
save
this
country
for
the
continues
to
be
almost
the
only
paper
that
the
crisis
has
sobered
and
not
tipsified
i
take
it
in
myself
and
know
many
others
who
do
so
part
of
the
fun
about
is
that
quite
a
lot
of
old
ladies
of
both
sexes
go
about
distinguishing
elaborately
between
the
and
the
it
is
a
stagnant
state
of
mind
created
in
people
who
have
never
been
forced
by
revolution
or
other
public
peril
to
distinguish
between
the
things
they
are
used
to
and
the
thoughts
for
which
the
things
are
supposed
to
stand
if
you
printed
the
whole
of
ally
sloper
half
holiday
and
called
it
the
athenaeum
they
would
read
it
with
unmoved
faces
so
long
as
paul
cathedral
stood
in
the
usual
place
they
would
not
mind
if
there
was
a
crescent
on
top
of
it
instead
of
a
cross
by
the
way
i
see
the
germans
have
actually
done
what
i
described
as
a
wild
fancy
in
the
flying
inn
combined
the
cross
and
the
crescent
in
one
ornamental
symbol
both
these
papers
were
then
owned
by
the
same
man
alfred
harmsworth
who
had
become
lord
northcliffe
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
attack
upon
harmsworth
which
the
developed
attributed
too
much
to
purposed
malice
and
did
not
allow
enough
for
the
journalistic
craving
for
news
and
for
scoops
probably
some
of
the
posters
and
articles
to
which
they
objected
were
not
the
work
of
lord
northcliffe
but
of
some
young
journalist
anxious
to
sell
his
paper
nevertheless
the
attack
was
not
only
largely
justified
but
was
also
remarkably
courageous
the
staff
of
the
were
themselves
journalists
and
men
of
letters
in
both
capacities
as
powerful
a
newspaper
owner
as
lord
northcliffe
could
damage
them
severely
and
did
never
henceforward
would
any
of
them
be
able
to
write
in
one
of
his
numerous
papers
never
would
one
of
their
books
receive
a
favourable
review
for
belloc
did
not
hesitate
to
call
lord
northcliffe
a
traitor
for
the
way
in
which
he
had
attacked
kitchener
while
cecil
amused
himself
by
reviewing
and
pointing
out
the
illiteracy
of
that
strange
peer
own
writing
later
too
when
the
harmsworth
papers
were
in
full
cry
for
the
fall
of
asquith
and
the
substitution
of
lloyd
george
the
took
a
strong
stand
they
pointed
out
too
the
way
in
which
censorship
was
exercised
against
the
smaller
newspapers
while
the
northcliffe
press
seemed
immune
here
was
the
fundamental
danger
whatever
the
motive
some
of
the
attacks
and
articles
printed
were
undoubtedly
calculated
in
military
language
to
cause
alarm
and
despondency
it
was
appalling
that
in
time
of
war
this
should
be
permitted
and
as
they
saw
it
permitted
because
the
harmsworth
millions
had
been
used
to
secure
a
hold
on
certain
politicians
to
the
george
was
simply
harmsworth
man
meanwhile
at
easter
came
the
awful
tragedy
of
the
irish
rising
chesterton
had
fallen
into
the
sleep
of
his
long
illness
soon
after
the
splendid
gesture
in
which
redmond
had
offered
the
sword
of
ireland
to
the
allied
cause
and
there
seems
little
doubt
that
in
making
this
offer
redmond
had
with
him
for
the
last
time
the
people
of
ireland
recruiting
began
well
but
that
awful
fate
of
stupidity
that
seems
to
overtake
every
englishman
dealing
with
ireland
even
now
was
overwhelming
the
two
countries
sir
francis
vane
an
irish
officer
in
the
british
army
described
in
a
series
of
articles
in
the
the
blunders
made
in
the
recruiting
campaign
such
things
as
prominent
protestant
unionists
being
brought
to
the
fore
national
sentiment
discouraged
waving
of
union
jacks
appeals
to
patriotism
not
for
ireland
but
for
england
vane
himself
found
his
attempt
at
recruiting
on
national
lines
unpopular
with
authority
and
in
the
midst
of
his
successful
effort
was
recalled
to
england
still
though
recruiting
slackened
the
cause
of
the
allies
remained
in
ireland
the
popular
cause
and
the
easter
rising
was
the
work
only
of
a
handful
of
men
its
immediate
cause
was
the
fact
that
although
the
home
rule
bill
had
been
passed
and
was
on
the
statute
book
its
operation
was
again
deferred
all
irishmen
saw
this
as
a
breach
of
faith
yet
the
majority
were
not
at
that
time
behind
the
rising
the
severity
of
its
repression
turned
it
almost
overnight
into
a
national
cause
and
erected
yet
another
barrier
against
friendship
between
england
and
ireland
for
this
friendship
chesterton
longed
ardently
and
worked
passionately
nor
did
he
believe
the
barriers
insurmountable
he
even
held
that
there
was
between
the
people
of
the
two
countries
a
natural
amity
there
is
something
common
to
all
the
britons
which
even
acts
of
union
have
not
torn
asunder
the
nearest
name
for
it
is
insecurity
something
fitting
in
men
walking
on
cliffs
and
the
verge
of
things
adventure
a
lonely
taste
in
liberty
a
humour
without
wit
perplex
their
critics
and
perplex
themselves
their
souls
are
fretted
like
their
coasts
the
irish
and
the
english
had
suffered
oppression
at
the
same
hands
those
of
the
rulers
of
england
if
prussian
soldiers
had
been
used
against
irish
peasants
so
too
had
they
been
used
against
english
chartists
a
typical
englishman
william
cobbett
had
suffered
fine
and
long
imprisonment
because
of
his
protest
against
the
flogging
of
an
english
soldier
by
a
german
mercenary
short
history
of
p
telling
the
truth
about
ireland
wrote
chesterton
is
not
very
pleasant
to
a
patriotic
englishman
but
it
is
very
patriotic
for
the
lack
of
the
essential
patriotism
of
admitting
past
sin
the
rulers
of
england
were
perpetuating
an
evil
that
many
of
them
sincerely
desired
to
end
for
this
was
a
case
where
the
right
road
could
only
be
found
by
retracing
the
steps
of
a
long
road
of
wrong
crimes
of
p
before
the
end
of
the
war
visited
ireland
and
in
the
book
that
he
wrote
after
this
visit
may
be
found
his
best
analysis
of
all
this
matter
ireland
he
believed
was
making
a
mistake
in
not
throwing
herself
into
the
cause
of
the
defeat
of
germany
not
because
she
owed
anything
to
england
but
because
of
what
prussia
was
and
of
what
europe
meant
ireland
had
been
the
friend
of
france
and
the
enemy
of
prussia
long
before
england
had
been
either
she
would
do
well
to
hold
to
her
ancient
allegiance
it
was
true
that
ireland
had
been
betrayed
by
the
liberal
promise
of
home
rule
but
the
men
who
betrayed
her
were
the
marconi
men
redmond
had
made
the
great
mistake
of
his
career
when
from
motives
of
patriotism
for
ireland
he
had
helped
the
party
hacks
of
the
government
committee
to
whitewash
these
men
who
had
gone
on
to
betray
ireland
as
they
were
then
betraying
england
england
too
needed
home
rule
england
too
needed
deliverance
from
her
degenerate
and
unworthy
governing
class
there
are
a
few
pages
in
now
out
of
find
their
place
here
in
illustration
of
what
he
meant
by
his
championship
of
nationality
a
brilliant
writer
once
propounded
to
me
his
highly
personal
and
even
perverse
type
of
internationalism
by
saying
as
a
sort
of
unanswerable
challenge
would
you
rather
be
ruled
by
goethe
than
by
walter
long
i
replied
that
words
could
not
express
the
wild
love
and
loyalty
i
should
feel
for
walter
long
if
the
only
alternative
were
goethe
i
could
not
have
put
my
own
national
case
in
a
clearer
or
more
compact
form
i
might
occasionally
feel
inclined
to
kill
long
but
under
the
approaching
shadow
of
goethe
i
should
feel
more
inclined
to
kill
myself
that
is
the
deathly
element
in
denationalisation
that
it
poisons
life
itself
the
most
real
of
all
realities
some
people
felt
it
an
affectation
that
the
irish
should
put
up
their
street
signs
in
gaelic
but
defended
it
it
is
well
to
remember
that
these
things
which
we
also
walk
past
every
day
are
exactly
the
sort
of
things
that
always
have
in
the
nameless
fashion
the
national
note
it
is
this
sensation
of
stemming
a
stream
of
ten
thousand
things
all
pouring
one
way
labels
titles
monuments
metaphors
modes
of
address
assumptions
in
controversy
that
make
an
englishman
in
ireland
know
that
he
is
in
a
strange
land
nor
is
he
merely
bewildered
as
among
a
medley
of
strange
things
on
the
contrary
if
he
has
any
sense
he
soon
finds
them
united
and
simplified
to
a
single
impression
as
if
he
were
talking
to
a
strange
person
he
can
not
define
it
because
nobody
can
define
a
person
and
nobody
can
define
a
nation
he
can
only
see
it
smell
it
hear
it
handle
it
bump
into
it
fall
over
it
kill
it
be
killed
for
it
or
be
damned
for
doing
it
wrong
he
must
be
content
with
these
mere
hints
of
its
existence
but
he
can
not
define
it
because
it
is
like
a
person
and
no
book
of
logic
will
undertake
to
define
aunt
jane
or
uncle
william
we
can
only
say
with
more
or
less
mournful
conviction
that
if
aunt
jane
is
not
a
person
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
person
and
i
say
with
equal
conviction
that
if
ireland
is
not
a
nation
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
nation
in
september
cecil
chesterton
bade
farewell
to
the
he
was
in
the
army
as
a
private
in
the
east
in
the
east
surreys
and
took
over
the
editorship
i
like
chesterton
paper
the
wrote
an
american
journalist
in
the
york
no
yet
since
has
taken
it
over
gilbert
chesterton
seems
to
me
the
best
thing
england
has
produced
since
dickens
i
like
the
things
he
believes
in
and
i
hate
sociological
experts
and
prohibitionists
and
uhlan
officers
which
are
the
things
he
hates
i
feel
in
him
that
a
very
honest
man
is
speaking
i
like
his
impudence
to
northcliffe
as
a
journalist
chesterton
gets
only
about
a
quarter
of
himself
into
action
but
even
a
quarter
of
chesterton
is
good
measure
he
works
very
hard
at
his
journalism
that
is
why
he
does
do
it
as
well
as
his
careless
things
which
give
him
fun
but
for
all
that
there
is
no
other
editorial
page
in
england
or
the
united
states
written
with
the
snap
wit
and
honest
humanity
of
his
paragraphs
i
hope
he
wo
blunt
himself
by
overwork
it
would
be
an
international
loss
if
that
sane
jolly
mind
is
bent
to
routine
england
has
need
of
him
the
overwork
and
the
high
quality
of
it
were
alike
undeniable
but
after
the
long
repose
of
his
illness
seemed
like
a
giant
refreshed
and
ready
to
run
his
course
each
week
had
an
editorial
besides
the
paragraphs
of
which
the
york
speaks
not
all
of
these
however
written
by
himself
and
a
signed
article
under
the
suggestive
general
heading
at
the
sign
of
the
world
end
the
difference
between
articles
and
a
real
book
and
the
degree
of
work
needed
to
turn
the
one
into
the
other
may
be
seen
if
the
essays
on
marriage
in
the
paper
be
compared
with
superstition
of
for
which
they
furnished
material
and
those
on
ireland
with
there
were
besides
very
many
articles
in
other
papers
english
and
american
and
he
was
also
writing
his
of
if
all
englishmen
had
kept
the
same
unwavering
gaze
at
reality
as
chesterton
much
of
what
he
called
the
rather
reaction
that
followed
the
war
might
have
been
avoided
and
with
it
the
advent
of
hitler
particularly
he
opposed
the
tendency
to
call
kaiserism
what
is
now
called
hitlerism
and
should
always
be
called
prussianism
while
agreeing
that
care
should
be
taken
not
to
write
of
german
atrocities
that
could
not
be
substantiated
he
insisted
that
there
was
no
ground
for
forgetting
or
ignoring
the
findings
of
the
american
enquiry
in
belgium
which
had
established
more
than
enough
these
horrors
the
bombing
of
civilians
shelling
of
open
towns
and
sinking
of
passenger
ships
culminating
with
the
lusitania
were
in
the
main
what
brought
america
into
the
war
here
as
with
england
chesterton
did
not
admit
as
primary
what
has
since
been
so
exclusively
stressed
the
economic
motive
here
as
with
england
he
took
the
volunteer
army
as
one
great
proof
of
the
will
of
a
nation
and
those
of
us
who
remember
can
testify
that
in
america
as
in
england
the
will
of
the
people
was
ahead
of
the
decision
of
the
politicians
on
one
point
chesterton
articles
have
a
special
interest
the
question
of
reprisals
when
the
germans
broke
yet
another
of
the
promises
of
the
hague
convention
and
initiated
the
use
of
poison
gas
there
was
much
discussion
as
to
the
ethics
of
reprisals
and
used
against
reprisals
two
arguments
one
of
which
was
a
rare
example
of
a
fallacy
in
his
arguments
if
a
wasp
stings
you
he
said
you
do
not
sting
back
no
we
might
reply
but
you
squash
it
you
have
as
a
man
an
advantage
over
a
wasp
and
so
do
not
need
to
use
its
own
weapons
to
defeat
it
his
other
argument
is
far
more
powerful
is
indeed
overwhelming
if
you
use
even
as
reprisals
unlawful
weapons
it
is
harder
to
prove
you
did
not
initiate
them
and
i
remember
well
another
feeling
at
the
time
expressed
by
which
was
i
believe
that
of
the
majority
of
english
people
if
we
use
these
things
if
we
accept
the
prussian
gospel
of
frightfulness
then
spiritually
we
have
lost
the
war
spiritually
prussia
has
conquered
as
she
has
engulfed
the
old
germanies
and
first
imposing
her
rule
then
gained
acceptance
of
her
ideas
so
it
may
be
with
us
ideas
are
everything
and
the
barbarians
destroy
more
with
ideas
even
than
by
material
weapons
horrible
as
these
may
be
inclined
at
first
to
hope
for
the
fruits
of
democracy
from
the
russian
revolution
chesterton
was
soon
being
reproached
by
wells
for
dirty
suspiciousness
about
the
bolshevik
leaders
and
their
motives
but
the
collapse
of
russia
and
the
defeat
of
rumania
alike
only
strengthened
the
necessity
of
the
fight
to
a
finish
with
prussia
that
became
as
the
months
passed
the
absorbing
aim
of
the
in
the
treaties
respectively
of
and
bukarest
germany
imposed
upon
these
two
countries
incredibly
harsh
terms
thus
wrote
the
after
the
treaty
of
bukarest
we
should
like
to
ask
the
pacifists
and
who
are
fond
of
official
documents
if
they
have
read
the
white
paper
dealing
with
the
plain
facts
about
the
peace
with
roumania
if
they
have
a
single
word
to
say
on
the
subject
we
should
be
much
interested
to
hear
what
it
is
it
makes
absolutely
plain
two
facts
both
of
which
have
a
sort
of
frightful
humour
after
all
the
humanitarian
talk
about
no
annexations
and
no
indemnities
the
first
is
that
the
conquerors
have
annexed
in
a
direct
and
personal
sense
beyond
what
is
commonly
meant
by
annexation
the
second
is
that
they
have
indemnified
themselves
by
an
immediate
coercion
and
extortion
which
is
generally
veiled
by
the
forms
of
a
recognised
indemnity
in
annexing
some
nine
thousand
square
miles
they
have
been
particular
to
attach
whole
forests
to
the
of
hungarian
nobles
and
the
timber
of
hungarian
wood
merchants
not
merely
annexing
as
a
conqueror
annexes
but
rather
stealing
as
an
individual
steals
further
the
fun
growing
fast
and
furious
they
have
taken
country
containing
a
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
roumanians
merely
because
it
is
uninhabited
land
for
the
second
point
we
often
speak
figuratively
of
tyrants
enslaving
a
country
but
teutons
do
literally
enslave
all
the
males
of
the
occupied
land
which
happens
to
be
of
roumania
are
driven
to
work
on
pain
of
death
or
prison
all
this
is
clear
and
satisfactory
enough
but
the
white
paper
keeps
the
best
to
the
last
it
is
this
sentence
we
would
commend
to
our
peaceful
friends
the
german
delegates
informed
the
roumanian
delegates
who
were
appalled
at
being
required
to
accept
such
conditions
that
they
would
appreciate
their
moderation
when
they
knew
those
which
would
be
imposed
on
the
western
powers
after
the
victory
of
the
central
empires
the
reminder
was
needed
far
less
than
most
people
was
chesterton
subject
to
that
weakness
of
the
human
spirit
that
brings
weariness
in
sustained
effort
and
premature
relaxation
prussia
had
not
he
said
shown
any
evidence
of
repentance
merely
of
regret
for
lack
of
success
the
kaiser
said
he
had
not
wanted
this
war
no
said
chesterton
he
wanted
a
very
different
war
chesterton
might
and
did
say
later
that
he
himself
had
wanted
a
very
different
peace
the
destruction
of
prussia
the
reconstruction
of
the
old
german
states
but
at
present
he
wanted
only
to
fight
on
until
this
became
possible
i
do
not
think
he
ever
hated
anybody
but
he
did
hate
prussianism
as
the
wickedness
that
hindered
loving
and
he
had
no
liking
for
the
patronizing
pacifism
of
the
gentleman
it
was
romain
rolland
who
took
a
holiday
in
the
alps
and
said
he
was
above
the
struggle
as
if
there
were
any
alp
from
which
the
soul
can
look
down
on
calvary
there
is
indeed
one
mountain
among
them
that
might
be
very
appropriate
to
so
detached
an
observer
the
mountain
named
after
pilate
the
man
who
washed
his
hands
of
fountain
library
his
keen
imagination
could
visualize
the
sufferings
caused
by
war
vicariously
he
knew
something
of
the
life
of
the
trenches
for
cecil
like
many
another
had
managed
to
get
to
france
a
delightful
article
on
comradeship
shows
what
letters
from
soldiers
confirm
how
perfectly
at
home
was
private
chesterton
among
his
fellows
and
how
much
loved
by
them
english
soldiers
are
classed
a
b
or
c
according
to
their
degree
of
physical
fitness
and
cecil
was
in
class
i
can
understand
a
pagan
but
not
a
christian
who
simply
dismisses
the
suffering
of
our
soldiers
as
useless
he
is
like
hyde
scorning
father
damien
or
like
those
who
cried
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
he
saved
others
himself
he
can
not
save
they
saved
others
these
men
their
suffering
was
that
of
the
human
race
whose
head
is
christ
with
him
they
bore
even
if
they
knew
it
not
that
mysterious
burden
of
humanity
that
makes
some
men
question
god
existence
but
draws
others
into
conscious
membership
of
his
mystical
body
many
were
so
drawn
in
those
days
and
there
seemed
a
new
lifting
up
of
the
cross
the
does
i
think
lack
one
note
a
little
they
were
too
busy
hating
prussianism
to
give
thought
to
the
christian
command
to
love
prussians
whose
sufferings
too
were
those
of
humanity
into
the
opposite
error
there
was
no
risk
that
they
would
fall
never
for
them
would
heroism
be
belittled
in
the
name
of
the
very
horrors
it
was
encountering
in
one
article
belloc
touched
on
this
strange
perversion
and
reminded
his
readers
that
the
power
to
ravage
and
destroy
was
not
really
a
new
result
of
modern
machinery
attila
and
his
huns
had
inflicted
even
greater
devastation
and
had
left
a
desert
behind
them
barbarism
in
its
nature
was
destructive
and
we
were
encountering
barbarism
in
so
doing
we
were
acting
the
part
of
christian
men
but
the
old
fights
still
had
to
be
waged
on
the
home
front
against
the
money
power
and
against
what
the
called
prussianism
at
home
unceasingly
they
battled
for
fair
treatment
for
wives
and
children
for
freedom
from
unmeaning
and
unnecessary
regulations
against
the
profiteering
by
big
firms
and
the
consequent
crushing
of
small
about
two
thousand
small
butchers
shops
for
instance
had
to
close
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
war
owing
to
a
cornering
of
supplies
by
the
large
firms
against
this
and
all
the
ramifications
of
the
meat
scandal
the
struggled
publishing
they
claimed
facts
unpublished
elsewhere
and
inspiring
questions
in
the
house
of
commons
belloc
irony
chesterton
wit
point
these
articles
and
make
them
worth
reading
as
literature
and
there
is
some
of
the
old
fooling
a
further
series
on
the
servile
state
is
attacked
by
shaw
who
thinks
that
belloc
since
he
is
not
a
socialist
must
be
a
follower
of
herbert
spencer
accounts
for
this
by
saying
that
shaw
had
not
read
belloc
how
do
you
know
retorts
shaw
it
is
not
herbert
spencer
i
have
not
read
suppose
you
had
your
choice
of
not
reading
a
book
by
belloc
and
not
reading
one
by
spencer
which
would
you
choose
hang
it
all
be
reasonable
the
economic
front
was
never
abandoned
and
the
paper
continued
to
attack
all
forms
of
socialism
including
the
recreation
of
bumble
by
sidney
webb
with
all
the
regimentation
of
the
poor
for
their
own
good
that
bumble
represented
the
inner
secrets
of
the
fabian
office
are
unfolded
by
shaw
in
a
letter
to
gilbert
dated
my
dear
if
you
want
to
expose
a
scandalous
orgy
in
the
you
may
depend
on
the
following
as
being
a
correct
account
by
an
eye
witness
you
know
that
there
is
a
body
called
the
fabian
research
department
of
which
i
have
the
hollow
honour
to
be
perpetual
grand
the
real
moving
spirit
being
sidney
webb
a
large
number
of
innocent
young
men
and
women
are
attracted
to
this
body
by
promises
of
employment
by
the
said
in
works
of
unlimited
and
inspiring
uplift
such
as
are
unceasingly
denounced
along
with
marconi
and
other
matters
in
your
organ
well
sidney
webb
summoned
all
these
young
things
to
an
uplifting
at
home
at
the
fabian
office
lately
they
came
in
crowds
and
sat
at
her
feet
whilst
she
prophesied
unto
them
with
occasional
comic
relief
from
the
unfortunate
perpetual
grand
at
the
decent
hour
of
ten
she
bade
them
good
night
and
withdrew
to
her
own
residence
and
to
bed
for
some
accidental
reason
or
other
i
lingered
until
as
i
thought
all
the
young
things
had
gone
home
i
should
explain
that
i
was
in
the
two
pair
back
at
last
i
started
to
go
home
myself
as
i
descended
the
stairs
i
was
stunned
by
the
most
infernal
din
i
have
ever
heard
even
at
the
front
coming
from
the
fabian
hall
which
would
otherwise
be
the
back
yard
on
rushing
to
this
temple
i
found
the
young
enthusiasts
sprawling
over
tables
over
radiators
over
everything
except
chairs
in
a
state
of
scandalous
abandonment
roaring
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
and
in
a
quite
unintelligible
manner
a
string
of
presumably
obscene
songs
accompanied
on
the
piano
with
frantic
gestures
and
astonishing
musical
skill
by
a
man
whom
i
had
always
regarded
as
a
respectable
fabian
researcher
but
who
now
turned
out
to
be
a
demon
pianist
my
secretary
put
in
two
rs
and
explains
that
she
was
thinking
of
harrods
svengali
a
horribly
sacrilegious
character
was
given
to
the
proceedings
by
the
fact
that
the
tune
they
were
singing
when
i
entered
was
luther
hymn
feste
burg
ist
unser
as
they
went
on
for
i
regret
to
say
that
my
presence
exercised
no
restraint
whatever
they
sang
their
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
litany
to
every
tune
however
august
its
associations
which
happened
to
fit
it
these
if
you
please
are
the
solemn
and
sour
neophytes
whose
puritanical
influence
has
kept
you
in
dread
for
so
many
years
but
i
have
not
told
you
the
worst
before
i
fled
from
the
building
i
did
at
last
discover
what
words
it
was
they
were
singing
when
it
first
flashed
on
me
i
really
could
not
believe
it
but
at
the
end
of
the
next
verse
no
doubt
or
error
was
possible
the
young
maenad
nearest
me
was
concluding
every
strophe
by
shrieking
that
she
care
where
the
water
went
if
it
did
get
into
the
wine
now
you
know
the
refrain
of
a
poem
in
flying
i
have
since
ascertained
that
a
breviary
of
this
black
mass
can
be
obtained
at
the
fabian
office
with
notes
of
the
numbers
of
the
hymns
ancient
and
modern
and
all
the
airs
sacred
and
profane
to
which
your
poems
have
been
set
this
letter
needs
no
answer
indeed
admits
of
none
i
leave
you
to
your
reflections
ever
the
shaw
worm
turns
on
wells
was
a
headline
in
the
over
a
vigorous
and
attack
the
others
were
apt
to
score
off
wells
in
these
exchanges
because
he
lost
and
became
irritable
even
with
gilbert
he
sometimes
broke
out
although
in
a
calmer
moment
he
told
shaw
that
to
get
angry
with
chesterton
was
an
impossibility
with
cecil
chesterton
it
was
only
too
easy
to
get
angry
at
any
rate
as
he
appeared
in
the
but
i
think
when
he
heard
cecil
was
in
france
wells
must
have
regretted
one
of
the
letters
he
wrote
to
gilbert
just
before
the
change
of
editorship
it
was
curious
the
contrast
between
the
genial
personality
so
loved
by
his
friends
and
the
waspishness
so
often
shown
by
cecil
and
his
staff
in
the
columns
of
the
paper
his
extraordinary
personality
writes
haynes
wonderfully
penetrated
the
eccentricity
of
his
appearance
his
features
were
slightly
fantastic
and
his
voice
was
as
loudly
discordant
as
his
laughter
but
the
real
charm
and
generosity
of
his
character
were
so
transparent
that
one
never
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
the
physical
medium
yet
with
all
my
sympathy
for
many
of
the
ideas
my
nerves
jangle
when
i
read
the
volumes
of
cecil
editorship
and
i
think
jangled
nerves
explain
if
they
do
not
excuse
this
outburst
by
wells
my
dear
have
i
on
the
whole
behaved
decently
to
you
have
i
always
shown
a
reasonable
civility
to
you
and
your
brother
and
belloc
have
i
betrayed
at
times
a
certain
affection
for
you
very
well
then
you
will
understand
that
i
do
start
out
to
pick
a
needless
quarrel
with
the
crowd
but
this
business
of
the
hueffer
book
in
the
makes
me
sick
some
disgusting
little
greaser
named
has
been
allowed
to
insult
old
in
a
series
of
letters
that
make
me
ashamed
of
my
species
hueffer
has
many
faults
no
doubt
but
firstly
he
poor
secondly
he
notoriously
unhappy
and
in
a
most
miserable
position
thirdly
he
a
better
writer
than
any
of
your
little
crowd
and
fourthly
instead
of
pleading
his
age
and
his
fat
and
taking
refuge
from
service
in
a
greasy
obesity
as
your
brother
has
done
he
is
serving
his
country
his
book
is
a
great
book
and
just
lies
about
it
i
guess
he
a
dirty
minded
priest
or
some
such
unclean
thing
when
he
says
it
is
the
story
of
a
stallion
and
so
forth
the
whole
outbreak
is
so
envious
so
base
so
that
i
will
never
let
the
into
the
house
again
regretfully
yours
wells
gilbert
replied
warwick
gardens
kensington
my
dear
wells
as
you
will
see
by
the
above
address
i
have
been
away
from
home
and
must
apologise
for
delay
i
am
returning
almost
at
once
however
most
certainly
you
have
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
and
i
have
always
tried
to
express
my
pride
in
the
fact
i
know
enough
of
your
good
qualities
in
other
ways
to
put
down
everything
in
your
last
letter
to
an
emotion
of
loyalty
to
another
friend
any
quarrel
between
us
will
not
come
from
me
and
i
confess
i
am
puzzled
as
to
why
it
should
come
from
you
merely
because
somebody
else
who
is
not
i
dislikes
a
book
by
somebody
else
who
is
not
you
and
says
so
in
an
article
for
which
neither
of
us
is
even
remotely
responsible
i
very
often
disagree
with
the
criticisms
of
i
do
not
know
anything
about
the
book
or
the
circumstances
of
hueffer
i
can
not
help
being
entertained
by
your
vision
of
who
is
not
a
priest
but
a
poor
journalist
and
i
believe
a
but
whoever
he
may
be
and
i
hardly
think
the
problem
worth
a
row
between
you
and
me
he
has
a
right
to
justice
and
you
must
surely
see
that
even
if
it
were
my
paper
i
could
not
either
tell
a
man
to
find
a
book
good
when
he
found
it
bad
or
sack
him
for
a
point
of
taste
which
has
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
principles
of
the
paper
for
the
rest
haynes
represents
the
much
more
than
a
reviewer
does
being
both
on
the
board
and
the
staff
and
he
has
put
your
view
in
the
paper
i
can
not
help
thinking
with
a
more
convincing
logic
you
sometimes
find
it
convenient
even
in
my
case
that
your
friends
are
less
touchy
than
you
are
by
all
means
drop
any
paper
you
dislike
though
if
you
do
it
for
every
book
review
you
think
unfair
i
fear
your
admirable
range
of
modern
knowledge
will
be
narrowed
of
the
paper
in
question
i
will
merely
say
this
my
brother
and
in
some
degree
the
few
who
have
worked
with
him
have
undertaken
a
task
of
public
criticism
for
the
sake
of
which
they
stand
in
permanent
danger
of
imprisonment
and
personal
ruin
we
are
incessantly
reminded
of
this
danger
and
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
suggest
that
we
have
any
motive
but
the
best
if
you
should
ever
think
it
right
to
undertake
such
a
venture
you
will
find
that
the
number
of
those
who
will
commit
their
journalistic
fortunes
to
it
is
singularly
small
and
includes
some
who
have
more
courage
and
honesty
than
acquaintance
with
the
hierarchy
of
art
it
is
even
likely
that
you
will
come
to
think
the
latter
less
important
yours
sans
rancune
chesterton
on
your
letter
in
order
to
be
as
fair
as
i
am
trying
to
be
i
observe
you
specially
mention
letters
you
will
see
of
course
that
this
does
not
make
any
difference
to
stop
letters
would
be
to
stop
haynes
letter
and
others
on
your
side
and
these
could
not
be
printed
without
permitting
a
rejoinder
i
post
this
from
beaconsfield
where
anything
further
will
find
me
it
ended
as
all
quarrels
did
that
anyone
started
with
gilbert
dear
also
i
ca
quarrel
with
you
but
the
hueffer
business
aroused
my
long
dormant
moral
indignation
and
i
let
fly
at
the
most
sensitive
part
of
the
constellation
the
only
part
about
whose
soul
i
care
i
hate
these
attacks
on
rather
miserable
exceptional
people
like
hueffer
and
masterman
i
know
these
are
perfect
men
but
their
defects
make
quite
sufficient
hells
for
them
without
these
public
peltings
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
written
to
instead
of
to
you
one
of
these
days
i
will
go
and
have
a
heart
to
heart
talk
to
him
only
i
always
get
so
amiable
when
i
meet
a
man
he
needs
it
i
mean
the
talking
to
yours
ever
through
the
war
progress
wells
appeared
to
chesterton
to
be
expressing
with
a
powerful
and
individual
genius
not
his
own
considered
views
but
the
reactions
of
public
opinion
as
britling
he
saw
the
war
through
and
even
called
it
a
war
to
end
war
as
clissold
he
asked
of
what
use
it
had
all
been
chesterton
speaks
of
him
as
a
rather
unstable
genius
and
the
genius
and
instability
alike
can
be
seen
in
his
meteor
appearances
in
the
and
in
his
books
several
of
these
he
sent
to
gilbert
who
wrote
i
have
been
trying
for
a
long
time
though
perpetually
baulked
with
business
and
journalism
to
write
and
thank
you
for
sending
me
in
so
generous
a
manner
your
ever
interesting
and
delightful
books
especially
as
divisions
touching
the
things
we
care
most
about
drive
me
every
time
i
review
them
to
deal
more
in
controversy
and
less
in
compliment
than
i
intend
the
truth
and
the
trouble
is
that
both
of
us
are
only
too
conscious
that
there
is
a
great
war
going
on
all
the
time
on
the
purely
mental
plane
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
your
view
is
often
a
heresy
and
i
know
only
too
well
that
when
you
lead
it
it
is
likely
to
be
a
large
heresy
i
fear
that
being
didactic
means
being
disproportionate
and
that
the
temptation
to
attack
something
i
think
i
can
correct
leads
to
missing
in
my
writing
not
in
my
reading
a
thousand
fine
things
that
i
could
never
imitate
it
is
lucky
for
me
that
you
are
not
very
often
a
when
i
bring
out
my
own
shapeless
and
amateurish
books
in
the
calls
wells
a
sportive
but
spiritual
child
of
huxley
he
delighted
in
his
wit
and
swiftness
of
mind
but
he
summarized
in
the
same
book
the
quality
which
runs
through
all
his
work
i
have
always
thought
that
he
too
swiftly
to
everything
possibly
as
a
part
of
the
swiftness
of
his
natural
genius
i
have
never
ceased
to
admire
and
sympathise
but
i
think
he
has
always
been
too
much
in
a
state
of
reaction
to
use
the
name
which
would
probably
annoy
him
most
i
think
he
is
a
permanent
reactionary
whenever
i
met
him
he
seemed
to
be
coming
from
somewhere
rather
than
going
anywhere
and
he
was
so
often
nearly
right
that
his
movements
irritated
me
like
the
sight
of
somebody
hat
being
perpetually
washed
up
by
the
sea
and
never
touching
the
shore
but
i
think
he
thought
that
the
object
of
opening
the
mind
is
simply
opening
the
mind
whereas
i
am
incurably
convinced
that
the
object
of
opening
the
mind
as
of
opening
the
mouth
is
to
shut
it
again
on
something
solid
no
change
of
mood
in
the
public
meant
any
change
in
the
group
in
a
powerful
article
in
reply
to
an
old
friend
who
asked
for
peace
because
the
war
was
destroying
freedom
belloc
told
him
that
freedom
had
gone
long
since
for
the
mass
of
englishmen
how
many
wrote
pacifists
or
resisted
the
detailed
destruction
of
all
liberty
for
the
populace
the
war
it
is
a
bitter
choice
between
freedom
and
patriotism
but
how
many
fought
for
freedom
before
it
gave
them
the
chance
of
fighting
against
patriotism
may
again
and
again
they
touched
the
spot
on
the
question
of
trading
with
the
enemy
in
this
as
in
all
their
attacks
they
made
one
point
of
enormous
importance
do
not
they
said
look
for
traitors
and
spies
among
waiters
and
small
traders
look
up
not
down
you
will
find
them
in
high
places
if
you
will
dare
to
look
they
dared
and
here
came
in
once
more
what
was
commonly
regarded
as
a
strange
crank
peculiar
to
the
chesterbelloc
their
outlook
towards
jews
usually
those
who
referred
to
it
spoke
of
a
religious
prejudice
again
and
again
the
not
always
patiently
but
with
unvarying
clarity
explained
they
had
no
religious
prejudice
against
jews
they
had
not
even
a
racial
prejudice
against
jews
though
this
i
think
was
true
only
of
some
of
the
staff
their
only
prejudice
was
against
the
pretence
that
a
jew
was
an
englishman
it
was
undeniable
that
there
were
for
example
rothschilds
in
paris
london
and
berlin
all
related
and
conducting
an
international
family
banking
business
there
were
in
london
and
paris
pronounced
in
the
french
style
whose
cousins
were
erlangers
pronounced
in
the
german
style
in
berlin
how
the
asked
could
members
of
such
families
feel
the
same
about
the
war
as
an
englishman
they
could
not
to
put
it
at
its
lowest
have
the
same
primary
loyalty
to
england
or
to
germany
either
their
primary
loyalty
must
be
indeed
it
ought
to
be
to
their
own
race
and
kindred
yet
this
was
surely
an
excessive
simplification
we
have
only
to
remember
that
lately
a
son
of
the
house
died
gallantly
as
an
english
airman
we
have
only
to
remember
the
thousands
of
jews
who
fought
in
our
ranks
in
this
war
and
the
last
very
many
jews
patriotic
for
england
and
for
america
many
were
patriotic
for
germany
this
no
doubt
makes
the
problem
more
acute
but
any
discussion
is
nonsense
that
omits
this
certain
fact
there
are
jews
patriotic
first
for
the
country
they
live
in
the
country
that
gave
them
home
and
citizenship
of
which
often
their
wives
and
mothers
are
descended
there
are
others
who
feel
that
jewry
is
their
this
was
the
fact
the
could
never
forget
a
jew
might
not
be
specially
in
feeling
yet
his
actions
might
help
germany
by
being
international
jewish
trading
trading
with
the
enemy
and
was
to
a
very
large
extent
continuing
in
spite
of
assurances
to
the
contrary
moreover
international
finance
was
getting
nervous
over
the
continuance
of
the
war
as
a
menace
to
its
own
future
it
wanted
peace
a
peace
that
should
still
leave
it
in
possession
in
this
country
and
in
germany
gilbert
chesterton
was
passionately
determined
to
cast
it
out
he
was
a
zionist
he
wished
for
the
jewish
people
the
peaceful
possession
of
a
country
of
their
own
but
he
demanded
urgently
that
they
should
no
longer
be
allowed
to
govern
his
country
marconi
still
obsessed
him
and
the
surrender
of
english
politics
to
the
money
power
seemed
to
him
to
represent
as
great
a
danger
for
the
future
as
prussianism
for
a
moment
the
two
dangers
were
the
one
danger
and
against
them
was
set
the
people
of
england
it
was
at
this
moment
that
chesterton
published
his
epic
of
the
english
people
which
he
called
a
history
frank
swinnerton
has
how
this
book
came
to
be
written
chatto
windus
for
whom
swinnerton
worked
had
asked
to
write
a
history
of
england
he
refused
on
the
ground
that
he
was
no
historian
later
he
signed
a
contract
with
the
same
publishers
for
a
book
of
essays
then
discovered
that
he
was
already
under
contract
to
give
this
book
to
another
firm
he
asked
chatto
windus
to
cancel
their
contract
and
offered
to
write
something
else
for
them
swinnerton
account
continues
p
the
publishers
concealing
jubilation
sternly
recalled
their
original
proposal
for
a
short
history
of
england
shrieks
and
groans
were
distinctly
heard
all
the
way
from
beaconsfield
but
the
promise
was
kept
the
history
of
was
what
chesterton
must
have
called
a
wild
and
awful
success
it
probably
has
been
the
most
generally
read
of
all
his
books
but
while
the
credit
for
it
is
his
he
must
not
be
blamed
for
impudence
in
essaying
history
when
the
inspiration
arose
in
another
head
not
mine
and
when
in
fact
no
man
ever
went
to
the
writing
of
a
literary
work
with
less
confidence
you
can
find
no
dates
in
this
history
and
a
minimum
of
facts
but
you
can
find
vision
the
history
professors
at
london
university
said
to
lawrence
solomon
that
it
was
full
of
inaccuracies
yet
he
got
something
we
had
got
might
well
have
borrowed
from
newman
and
called
it
an
essay
in
aid
of
a
history
of
england
he
showed
something
of
the
great
moral
change
which
turned
the
roman
empire
into
christendom
by
which
each
great
thing
to
which
it
afterwards
gave
birth
was
baptised
into
a
promise
or
at
least
into
a
hope
of
permanence
it
may
be
that
each
of
its
ideas
was
as
it
were
mixed
with
immortality
the
english
people
had
been
free
and
happy
as
a
part
of
this
great
thing
cultivating
their
own
land
establishing
by
their
guilds
a
social
scheme
based
upon
pity
and
a
craving
for
equality
building
cathedrals
and
worshipping
god
with
the
holy
land
much
nearer
to
a
plain
man
house
than
westminster
and
immeasurably
nearer
than
runnymede
all
life
was
made
lovely
by
this
prodigious
presence
of
a
religious
transfiguration
in
common
life
and
only
began
to
darken
with
the
successful
rebellion
of
the
rich
under
henry
viii
probably
too
big
a
proportion
is
given
by
chesterton
to
the
great
crime
that
overshadowed
for
him
the
rest
of
english
history
yet
he
does
justice
in
brilliant
phrasing
to
the
eighteenth
century
whigs
still
more
to
chatham
and
burke
and
to
johnson
whom
he
so
loved
and
to
whom
he
was
often
compared
but
supremely
he
loved
nelson
who
dies
with
his
stars
on
his
bosom
and
his
heart
upon
his
sleeve
for
nelson
was
the
type
and
chief
exemplar
of
the
ordinary
englishman
the
very
hour
of
his
death
the
very
name
of
his
ship
are
touched
with
that
epic
completeness
which
critics
call
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
and
prophets
the
hand
of
god
his
very
faults
and
failures
were
heroic
not
in
a
loose
but
in
a
classic
sense
in
that
he
fell
only
like
the
legendary
heroes
weakened
by
a
woman
not
foiled
by
any
foe
among
men
and
he
remains
the
incarnation
of
a
spirit
in
the
english
that
is
purely
poetic
so
poetic
that
it
fancies
itself
a
thousand
things
and
sometimes
even
fancies
itself
prosaic
at
a
recent
date
in
an
age
of
reason
in
a
country
already
calling
itself
dull
and
with
and
factory
chimneys
already
beginning
to
rise
like
towers
of
funereal
efficiency
this
country
clergyman
son
moved
to
the
last
in
a
luminous
cloud
and
acted
a
fairy
tale
he
shall
remain
as
a
lesson
to
those
who
do
not
understand
england
and
a
mystery
to
those
who
think
they
do
in
outward
action
he
led
his
ships
to
victory
and
died
upon
a
foreign
sea
but
symbolically
he
established
something
indescribable
and
intimate
something
that
sounds
like
a
native
proverb
he
was
the
man
who
burnt
his
ships
and
who
for
ever
set
the
thames
on
fire
the
of
the
white
had
been
a
poem
about
english
legends
and
origins
the
too
was
called
a
poem
by
the
reviewers
and
it
was
it
was
a
poem
about
falstaff
and
sam
weller
and
even
the
artful
dodger
who
in
so
many
british
colonies
had
turned
into
robinson
crusoe
his
rulers
had
tried
to
educate
him
they
had
tried
to
germanize
him
and
to
teach
him
to
embrace
a
saxon
because
he
was
the
other
half
of
an
all
english
culture
had
been
based
for
a
century
and
more
on
ardent
admiration
for
german
and
then
the
day
came
and
the
ignorant
fellow
found
he
had
other
things
to
learn
and
he
was
quicker
than
his
educated
countrymen
for
he
had
nothing
to
unlearn
he
in
whose
honour
all
had
been
said
and
sung
stirred
and
stepped
across
the
border
of
belgium
then
were
spread
out
before
men
eyes
all
the
beauties
of
his
culture
and
all
the
benefits
of
his
organization
then
we
beheld
under
a
lifting
daybreak
what
light
we
had
followed
and
after
what
image
we
had
laboured
to
refashion
ourselves
nor
in
any
story
of
mankind
has
the
irony
of
god
chosen
the
foolish
things
so
catastrophically
to
confound
the
wise
for
the
common
crowd
of
poor
and
ignorant
englishmen
because
they
only
knew
that
they
were
englishmen
burst
through
the
filthy
cobwebs
of
four
hundred
years
and
stood
where
their
fathers
stood
when
they
knew
that
they
were
christian
men
the
english
poor
broken
in
every
revolt
bullied
by
every
fashion
long
despoiled
of
property
and
now
being
despoiled
of
liberty
entered
history
with
a
noise
of
trumpets
and
turned
themselves
in
two
years
into
one
of
the
iron
armies
of
the
world
and
when
the
critic
of
politics
and
literature
feeling
that
this
war
is
after
all
heroic
looks
around
him
to
find
the
hero
he
can
point
to
nothing
but
a
mob
chapter
xxii
after
the
armistice
the
months
that
followed
the
signing
of
the
armistice
were
the
darkest
in
gilbert
chesterton
life
nothing
but
the
immense
natural
high
spirits
of
the
group
could
have
carried
them
through
the
many
years
in
which
they
cried
their
unheeded
warnings
to
england
but
now
as
the
war
drew
to
an
end
a
new
note
of
optimism
had
become
audible
the
prussian
menace
was
almost
conquered
our
soldiers
would
return
and
would
bring
with
them
the
courage
and
confidence
of
victors
they
might
overthrow
the
governing
plutocracy
and
build
again
an
england
of
freedom
and
sanity
but
one
soldier
did
not
return
the
one
to
whom
this
group
looked
for
comradeship
and
inspiration
on
december
cecil
chesterton
died
in
hospital
in
france
his
courage
was
heroic
native
positive
and
equal
wrote
belloc
always
at
the
highest
potentiality
of
courage
gilbert
wrote
he
lived
long
enough
to
march
to
the
victory
which
was
for
him
a
supreme
vision
of
liberty
and
the
light
the
work
which
he
put
first
he
did
before
he
died
the
work
which
he
put
second
but
very
near
to
the
other
he
left
for
us
to
do
there
are
many
of
us
who
will
abandon
many
other
things
and
recognize
no
greater
duty
than
to
do
it
this
second
work
was
the
fight
at
home
against
corruption
and
for
freedom
for
the
english
people
it
is
impossible
to
remember
gilbert
chesterton
vividly
and
to
write
the
word
bitterness
it
was
rather
with
a
profound
and
burning
indignation
that
he
thought
of
his
fellow
englishmen
who
had
fought
and
died
and
then
looked
up
and
saw
marconi
george
and
marconi
isaacs
still
rulers
of
the
fate
of
his
country
thus
meditating
he
wrote
an
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
the
men
that
worked
for
england
they
have
their
graves
at
home
and
bees
and
birds
of
england
about
the
cross
can
roam
but
they
that
fought
for
england
following
a
falling
star
alas
alas
for
england
they
have
their
graves
afar
and
they
that
rule
in
england
in
stately
conclave
met
alas
alas
for
england
they
have
no
graves
as
yet
p
strange
irony
of
cecil
chesterton
last
weeks
his
old
enemy
godfrey
isaacs
brought
an
action
for
perjury
against
sir
charles
hobhouse
both
men
counsel
agreed
and
the
judge
stressed
that
perjury
lay
on
one
side
or
the
other
the
case
was
given
against
isaacs
he
appealed
and
his
appeal
was
dismissed
perjury
had
lain
on
one
side
or
the
other
meanwhile
news
came
that
rufus
isaacs
now
lord
reading
had
gone
with
lloyd
george
to
paris
to
attend
the
peace
conference
all
that
this
might
mean
the
peril
to
poland
the
danger
of
a
prussia
kept
at
the
head
of
the
germanies
for
the
sake
of
international
finance
an
abasement
of
england
before
those
countries
that
had
not
forgotten
marconi
all
this
was
vivid
to
gilbert
chesterton
in
the
same
number
of
the
in
which
he
mourned
his
brother
he
wrote
under
the
sign
of
the
world
end
an
open
letter
to
lord
reading
my
lord
i
address
to
you
a
public
letter
as
it
is
upon
a
public
question
it
is
unlikely
that
i
should
ever
trouble
you
with
any
private
letter
on
any
private
question
and
least
of
all
on
the
private
question
that
now
fills
my
mind
it
would
be
impossible
altogether
to
ignore
the
irony
that
has
in
the
last
few
days
brought
to
an
end
the
great
marconi
duel
in
which
you
and
i
in
some
sense
played
the
part
of
seconds
that
personal
part
of
the
matter
ended
when
cecil
chesterton
found
death
in
the
trenches
to
which
he
had
freely
gone
and
godfrey
isaacs
found
dismissal
in
those
very
courts
to
which
he
once
successfully
appealed
but
believe
me
i
do
not
write
on
any
personal
matter
nor
do
i
write
strangely
enough
perhaps
with
any
personal
acrimony
on
the
contrary
there
is
something
in
these
tragedies
that
almost
unnaturally
clarifies
and
enlarges
the
mind
and
i
think
i
write
partly
because
i
may
never
feel
so
magnanimous
again
it
would
be
irrational
to
ask
you
for
sympathy
but
i
am
sincerely
moved
to
offer
it
you
are
far
more
unhappy
for
your
brother
is
still
alive
if
i
turn
my
mind
to
you
and
your
type
of
politics
it
is
not
wholly
and
solely
through
that
trick
of
abstraction
by
which
in
moments
of
sorrow
a
man
finds
himself
staring
at
a
blot
on
the
tablecloth
or
an
insect
on
the
ground
i
do
of
course
realise
with
that
sort
of
dull
clarity
that
you
are
in
practise
a
blot
on
the
english
landscape
and
that
the
political
men
who
made
you
are
the
creeping
things
of
the
earth
but
i
am
in
all
sincerity
less
in
a
mood
to
mock
at
the
sham
virtues
they
parade
than
to
try
to
imagine
the
more
real
virtues
which
they
successfully
conceal
in
your
own
case
there
is
the
less
difficulty
at
least
in
one
matter
i
am
very
willing
to
believe
that
it
was
the
mutual
dependence
of
the
members
of
your
family
that
has
necessitated
the
sacrifice
of
the
dignity
and
independence
of
my
country
and
that
if
it
be
decreed
that
the
english
nation
is
to
lose
its
public
honour
it
will
be
partly
because
certain
men
of
the
tribe
of
isaacs
kept
their
own
strange
private
loyalty
i
am
willing
to
count
this
to
you
for
a
virtue
as
your
own
code
may
interpret
virtue
but
the
fact
would
alone
be
enough
to
make
me
protest
against
any
man
professing
your
code
and
administering
our
law
and
it
is
upon
this
point
of
your
public
position
and
not
upon
any
private
feelings
that
i
address
you
today
not
only
is
there
no
question
of
disliking
any
race
but
there
is
not
here
even
a
question
of
disliking
any
individual
it
does
not
raise
the
question
of
hating
you
rather
it
would
raise
in
some
strange
fashion
the
question
of
loving
you
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
how
much
a
good
citizen
would
have
to
love
you
in
order
to
tolerate
you
have
you
ever
considered
how
warm
indeed
how
wild
must
be
our
affection
for
the
particular
stray
who
has
somehow
turned
into
a
lord
chief
justice
to
be
strong
enough
to
make
us
accept
him
as
lord
chief
justice
it
is
not
a
question
of
how
much
we
dislike
you
but
of
how
much
we
like
you
of
whether
we
like
you
more
than
england
more
than
europe
more
than
poland
the
pillar
of
europe
more
than
honour
more
than
freedom
more
than
facts
it
is
not
in
short
a
question
of
how
much
we
dislike
you
but
of
how
far
we
can
be
expected
to
adore
you
to
die
for
you
to
decay
and
degenerate
for
you
for
your
sake
to
be
despised
for
your
sake
to
be
despicable
have
you
ever
considered
in
a
moment
of
meditation
how
curiously
valuable
you
would
really
have
to
be
that
englishmen
should
in
comparison
be
careless
of
all
the
things
you
have
corrupted
and
indifferent
to
all
the
things
that
you
may
yet
destroy
are
we
to
lose
the
war
which
we
have
already
won
that
and
nothing
else
is
involved
in
losing
the
full
satisfaction
of
the
national
claim
of
poland
is
there
any
man
who
doubts
that
the
jewish
international
is
unsympathetic
with
that
full
national
demand
and
is
there
any
man
who
doubts
that
you
will
be
sympathetic
with
the
jewish
international
no
man
who
knows
anything
of
the
interior
facts
of
modern
europe
has
the
faintest
doubt
on
either
point
no
man
doubts
when
he
knows
whether
or
no
he
cares
do
you
seriously
imagine
that
those
who
know
that
those
who
care
are
so
idolatrously
infatuated
with
rufus
daniel
isaacs
as
to
tolerate
such
risk
let
alone
such
ruin
are
we
to
set
up
as
the
standing
representative
of
england
a
man
who
is
a
standing
joke
against
england
that
and
nothing
else
is
involved
in
setting
up
the
chief
marconi
minister
as
our
chief
foreign
minister
it
is
precisely
in
those
foreign
countries
with
which
such
a
minister
would
have
to
deal
that
his
name
would
be
and
has
been
a
sort
of
pantomime
proverb
like
panama
or
the
south
sea
bubble
foreigners
were
not
threatened
with
fine
and
imprisonment
for
calling
a
spade
a
spade
and
a
speculation
a
speculation
foreigners
were
not
punished
with
a
perfectly
lawless
law
of
libel
for
saying
about
public
men
what
those
very
men
had
afterwards
to
admit
in
public
foreigners
were
who
were
really
allowed
to
see
most
of
the
game
when
our
public
saw
nothing
of
the
game
and
they
made
not
a
little
game
of
it
are
they
henceforth
to
make
game
of
everything
that
is
said
and
done
in
the
name
of
england
in
the
affairs
of
europe
have
you
the
serious
impudence
to
call
us
because
we
are
not
so
extravagantly
fond
of
one
particular
jew
as
to
endure
this
for
him
alone
no
my
lord
the
beauties
of
your
character
shall
not
so
blind
us
to
all
elements
of
reason
and
we
can
still
control
our
affections
if
we
are
fond
of
you
we
are
not
quite
so
fond
of
you
as
that
if
we
are
anything
but
we
are
not
in
that
peculiar
and
personal
fashion
if
we
are
lovers
we
will
not
kill
ourselves
for
love
after
weighing
and
valuing
all
your
virtues
the
qualities
of
our
own
country
take
their
due
and
proportional
part
in
our
esteem
because
of
you
she
shall
not
die
we
can
not
tell
in
what
fashion
you
yourself
feel
your
strange
position
and
how
much
you
know
it
is
a
false
position
i
have
sometimes
thought
i
saw
in
the
faces
of
such
men
as
you
that
you
felt
the
whole
experience
as
unreal
a
mere
masquerade
as
i
myself
might
feel
it
if
by
some
fantastic
luck
in
the
old
fantastic
civilisation
of
china
i
were
raised
from
the
yellow
button
to
the
coral
button
or
from
the
coral
button
to
the
peacock
feather
precisely
because
these
things
would
be
grotesque
i
might
hardly
feel
them
as
incongruous
precisely
because
they
meant
nothing
to
me
i
might
be
satisfied
with
them
i
might
enjoy
them
without
any
shame
at
my
own
impudence
as
an
alien
adventurer
precisely
because
i
could
not
feel
them
as
dignified
i
should
not
know
what
i
had
degraded
my
fancy
may
be
quite
wrong
it
is
but
one
of
many
attempts
i
have
made
to
imagine
and
allow
for
an
alien
psychology
in
this
matter
and
if
you
and
jews
far
worthier
than
you
are
wise
they
will
not
dismiss
as
what
may
well
prove
the
last
serious
attempt
to
sympathise
with
semitism
i
allow
for
your
position
more
than
most
men
allow
for
it
more
most
assuredly
than
most
men
will
allow
for
it
in
the
darker
days
that
yet
may
come
it
is
utterly
false
to
suggest
that
either
i
or
a
better
man
than
i
whose
work
i
now
inherit
desired
this
disaster
for
you
and
yours
i
wish
you
no
such
ghastly
retribution
daniel
son
of
isaac
go
in
peace
but
go
yours
chesterton
in
those
last
sentences
the
spirit
of
prophecy
was
upon
chesterton
after
a
truly
dark
and
deep
fashion
yet
even
he
did
not
guess
that
the
retribution
he
feared
would
fall
not
upon
that
tribe
of
isaacs
thus
established
in
english
government
but
upon
the
unfortunate
jewish
people
as
a
whole
from
the
german
nation
that
isaacs
had
gone
to
paris
to
protect
for
there
was
no
doubt
in
chesterton
mind
that
it
was
his
work
at
the
peace
conference
to
strive
for
the
survival
of
prussia
no
matter
how
europe
and
the
rest
of
the
germanies
suffered
the
hated
the
treaty
of
versailles
in
its
eventual
form
as
much
as
hitler
hates
it
but
for
a
very
different
reason
all
human
judgments
are
limited
and
no
doubt
there
was
a
mixture
of
truth
and
error
in
chesterton
view
of
the
years
that
followed
but
in
the
universal
reaction
from
the
to
pacifism
the
truths
he
was
urging
received
scant
attention
his
really
amazing
prophecies
fell
on
deaf
ears
he
will
almost
certainly
monsignor
knox
has
said
be
remembered
as
a
prophet
in
an
age
of
false
prophets
and
it
is
not
insignificant
that
today
it
has
become
the
fashion
to
say
as
he
said
years
ago
and
steadily
reiterated
that
the
peace
of
was
only
an
armistice
in
the
panegyric
preached
in
westminster
cathedral
june
just
before
leaving
england
for
the
front
cecil
had
married
miss
ada
jones
who
had
long
worked
with
him
on
the
paper
and
who
continued
to
write
both
for
it
and
later
for
doing
especially
the
dramatic
criticism
under
the
of
prothero
later
on
she
was
to
become
famous
for
her
exploit
in
spending
a
fortnight
investigating
in
the
guise
of
a
tramp
the
london
of
women
she
wrote
darkest
and
founded
the
cecil
houses
to
improve
the
very
bad
conditions
she
had
discovered
and
in
memory
of
her
husband
at
this
date
cecil
chesterton
visited
poland
and
wrote
a
series
of
articles
describing
the
polish
struggle
for
life
and
freedom
several
poles
also
contributed
articles
to
the
paper
there
was
not
i
imagine
on
the
staff
one
single
writer
with
the
kind
of
ignorance
that
enabled
lloyd
george
to
confess
in
paris
that
he
did
not
know
where
teschen
was
here
was
the
first
tragedy
of
versailles
the
representatives
of
both
america
and
england
were
ignorant
of
the
reality
of
europe
wilson
was
as
chesterton
often
said
a
much
better
man
than
lloyd
george
but
he
knew
as
little
of
the
world
which
he
had
come
to
reconstruct
he
was
too
a
political
doctrinaire
preferring
what
was
not
there
in
the
shape
of
a
league
of
nations
to
the
real
nations
of
poland
or
italy
and
with
the
american
as
with
the
welshman
international
finance
stood
beside
the
politicians
and
whispered
in
their
ears
an
interesting
article
appeared
in
the
by
an
american
who
said
that
no
leading
journal
in
his
own
country
would
print
it
any
more
than
any
english
one
he
described
the
opposition
of
masses
of
ordinary
americans
to
the
league
of
nations
and
how
a
chicago
banker
who
however
had
no
international
interests
had
heartily
agreed
with
this
opposition
but
the
same
banker
had
written
to
him
next
day
eating
his
own
words
in
the
interim
he
had
met
the
other
bankers
this
american
correspondent
held
with
the
that
the
league
of
nations
was
mainly
a
device
of
international
finance
so
framed
as
to
enlist
also
the
support
of
pacifist
idealists
who
really
believed
it
would
make
for
peace
only
one
thing
said
the
would
make
for
a
stable
peace
remove
prussia
from
her
position
at
the
head
of
germany
make
her
regaining
of
it
impossible
make
a
strong
poland
and
a
strong
italy
as
well
as
a
strong
france
later
on
they
said
they
had
disapproved
of
the
weakening
of
austria
but
though
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
is
true
in
principle
i
can
not
find
much
mention
of
austria
in
the
paper
poland
italy
and
ireland
fill
their
columns
and
the
freeing
of
england
they
claimed
that
theirs
was
in
the
main
the
policy
of
clemenceau
but
both
chesterton
and
belloc
admitted
that
clemenceau
even
if
he
desired
a
strong
poland
as
a
barrier
between
germany
and
russia
shared
with
his
colleagues
an
equal
responsibility
in
the
destruction
of
austria
which
proved
so
fatal
he
was
too
much
a
freemason
to
desire
many
catholic
states
the
interests
of
france
were
not
those
of
italy
which
certainly
went
to
the
wall
and
was
turned
thereby
from
friend
and
ally
into
enemy
and
the
summed
up
the
fate
of
ireland
in
the
suggestion
that
lloyd
george
had
said
to
wilson
if
you
wo
look
at
ireland
i
wo
look
at
mexico
both
lloyd
george
and
wilson
were
too
to
do
other
than
dislike
in
lloyd
george
case
is
the
word
catholic
poland
it
is
certain
that
lloyd
george
in
particular
worked
savagely
against
the
poland
that
should
have
been
a
commission
appointed
by
the
peace
conference
reported
in
favour
of
poland
owning
the
port
of
danzig
and
territory
approximating
to
her
historic
boundaries
and
in
particular
including
east
prussia
in
which
there
was
still
a
majority
of
poles
lloyd
george
sent
back
the
report
for
revision
they
made
it
again
on
the
same
lines
it
was
a
strange
anomaly
that
this
man
should
have
sat
at
the
council
table
representing
a
great
country
in
the
past
men
had
sat
there
who
not
only
knew
much
of
europe
themselves
but
who
had
as
their
advisers
the
foreign
office
with
all
its
experience
and
tradition
belloc
pointed
out
in
an
article
on
versailles
that
the
english
tradition
had
been
to
hold
a
balance
between
conflicting
extremes
and
thus
to
bring
about
a
peace
that
at
least
ensured
stability
for
a
long
period
but
here
was
a
man
too
ignorant
to
realize
the
dangers
of
his
own
ignorance
and
therefore
seek
help
from
experience
this
peace
would
be
belloc
foretold
the
parent
of
many
wars
the
czechs
got
much
of
what
they
wanted
just
as
got
fiume
for
italy
by
seizing
it
poland
waited
for
versallles
and
enlisted
her
allies
yet
while
the
peace
conference
was
actually
in
session
germans
were
persecuting
poles
in
east
prussia
so
that
many
thousands
of
them
fled
into
poland
proper
and
thus
diminished
the
polish
population
of
east
prussia
before
any
plebiscite
could
be
taken
there
lloyd
george
and
churchill
sent
a
british
expeditionary
force
to
archangel
to
assist
the
white
russians
but
when
the
bolsheviks
invaded
poland
she
was
not
supported
nor
did
the
allies
send
her
the
raw
material
they
had
promised
to
rebuild
her
commercial
life
again
and
again
our
papers
reported
pogroms
in
poland
yet
close
investigation
by
writers
for
the
failed
to
discover
any
pogroms
in
the
cities
in
which
they
were
reported
as
occurring
powerful
are
the
words
in
which
in
april
chesterton
foretells
the
future
that
will
result
if
power
and
her
historic
port
are
refused
to
poland
we
know
that
a
flood
threatens
the
west
from
the
meeting
of
two
streams
the
revenge
of
germany
and
the
anarchy
of
russia
and
we
know
that
the
west
has
only
one
possible
dyke
against
such
a
flood
which
is
not
the
mere
existence
but
the
might
and
majesty
of
poland
we
know
that
without
some
such
christian
and
chivalric
shield
on
that
side
we
shall
have
half
europe
and
perhaps
half
asia
on
our
backs
we
know
exactly
what
the
germans
think
about
our
nationalities
in
the
west
and
exactly
what
the
bolshevists
think
about
any
nationalities
anywhere
we
know
that
if
the
poles
have
a
port
and
a
powerful
line
of
communication
with
the
west
they
will
be
eager
to
help
the
west
we
know
that
if
they
have
no
port
they
will
have
no
reason
to
help
the
west
and
no
power
to
help
anybody
we
know
that
if
they
lose
their
port
it
will
not
be
by
any
act
of
english
public
opinion
or
any
public
opinion
but
by
the
most
secret
of
all
secret
diplomacy
that
it
will
not
even
be
given
up
by
the
english
to
the
germans
but
by
german
jews
to
other
german
jews
we
know
that
such
international
adventurers
would
still
find
themselves
floating
on
the
top
of
any
tide
that
drowned
the
nations
and
that
they
do
not
care
what
nations
they
drown
we
know
that
out
of
the
whole
world
the
polish
port
is
the
one
place
that
should
have
been
held
and
the
one
place
that
is
being
surrendered
in
short
we
know
what
everybody
knows
and
scarcely
anybody
says
there
is
one
word
to
be
added

those
detached
persons
who
see
no
particular
objection
to
england
ceasing
to
be
english
who
do
not
care
about
the
national
names
of
the
west
which
have
been
the
greatest
words
in
the
poetry
of
the
world
so
far
as
we
know
there
is
only
one
ideal
they
do
care
about
and
they
will
not
get
it
whatever
else
this
betrayal
means
it
does
not
mean
peace
the
poles
have
raised
revolution
after
revolution
when
three
colossal
empires
prevented
them
from
being
a
nation
at
all
it
is
not
in
the
realm
of
sanity
to
suppose
that
if
we
make
them
half
a
nation
they
will
not
some
day
attempt
to
be
a
whole
nation
but
we
shall
come
back
to
the
place
where
we
started
after
another
cycle
of
terror
and
torment
and
abominable
butchery
and
to
a
place
where
we
might
in
peace
and
perfect
safety
stand
firm
today
not
by
any
act
of
english
public
opinion
would
poland
be
weakened
not
by
any
act
of
english
opinion
prussia
strengthened
or
ireland
oppressed
it
was
the
horror
of
the
situation
that
no
act
of
english
public
opinion
seemed
possible
for
the
organs
of
action
were
stultified
when
they
act
by
fighting
and
by
dying
englishmen
had
done
it
grandly
not
all
that
they
had
done
had
chesterton
believed
been
lost
because
of
them
the
cross
once
more
had
replaced
the
crescent
over
the
holy
city
of
jerusalem
because
of
them
alsace
and
lorraine
were
french
once
more
and
poland
lived
again
but
their
sufferings
and
their
death
had
not
availed
yet
to
save
england
and
what
is
theirs
though
banners
blow
on
warsaw
risen
again
or
ancient
laughter
walks
in
gold
through
the
vineyards
of
lorraine
their
dead
are
marked
on
english
stones
their
loves
on
english
trees
how
little
is
the
prize
they
win
how
mean
a
coin
for
these
how
small
a
shrivelled
lies
crumpled
here
and
curled
they
died
to
save
their
country
and
they
only
saved
the
world
pp
the
english
graves
in
the
he
wrote
july
on
peace
day
i
set
up
outside
my
house
two
torches
and
twined
them
with
laurel
because
i
thought
at
least
there
was
nothing
pacifist
about
laurel
but
that
night
after
the
bonfire
and
the
fireworks
had
faded
a
wind
grew
and
blew
with
gathering
violence
blowing
away
the
rain
and
in
the
morning
i
found
one
of
the
laurelled
posts
torn
off
and
lying
at
random
on
the
rainy
ground
while
the
other
still
stood
erect
green
and
glittering
in
the
sun
i
thought
that
the
pagans
would
certainly
have
called
it
an
omen
and
it
was
one
that
strangely
fitted
my
own
sense
of
some
great
work
half
fulfilled
and
half
frustrated
and
i
thought
vaguely
of
that
man
in
virgil
who
prayed
that
he
might
slay
his
foe
and
return
to
his
country
and
the
gods
heard
half
the
prayer
and
the
other
half
was
scattered
to
the
winds
for
i
knew
we
were
right
to
rejoice
since
the
tyrant
was
indeed
slain
and
his
tyranny
fallen
for
ever
but
i
know
not
when
we
shall
find
our
way
back
to
our
own
land
english
soldiers
in
ireland
felt
as
we
all
remember
a
strong
sympathy
with
the
irish
people
most
of
them
said
the
became
sinn
feiners
this
was
an
exaggeration
but
certainly
their
opposition
to
acting
as
terrorists
led
to
the
employment
in
their
stead
of
the
known
as
black
and
tans
and
in
england
itself
the
feeling
was
stirring
that
grew
stronger
as
the
years
passed
the
soldiers
who
were
the
nation
had
won
the
victory
the
politicians
had
thrown
it
away
a
rushed
election
before
most
of
the
men
were
demobilized
had
brought
back
the
same
old
politicians
by
turning
so
put
it
collusion
into
coalition
a
coalition
government
had
been
in
wartime
comprehensible
and
defensible
precisely
because
it
is
not
concerned
with
construction
or
reconstruction
but
only
with
the
warding
off
of
destruction
a
coalition
could
do
nothing
but
show
up
the
absurdity
of
the
old
party
labels
for
if
these
meant
anything
they
meant
that
their
wearers
wanted
an
entirely
different
kind
of
construction
at
which
therefore
they
could
not
collaborate
how
could
a
real
tory
in
construction
with
a
genuine
radical
it
was
the
culmination
of
unreality
the
idea
that
it
succeeded
for
the
moment
because
the
country
really
believed
that
lloyd
george
had
won
the
war
seemed
to
chesterton
the
crowning
absurdity
it
succeeded
because
the
party
machines
combined
to
finance
their
candidates
and
offered
them
to
a
rather
dazed
country
whose
men
were
still
in
great
numbers
under
arms
there
is
naturally
no
dissentient
when
hardly
anybody
seems
to
be
sentient
indifference
is
called
unanimity
how
then
could
this
indifference
be
thrown
off
how
could
the
returning
manhood
of
the
nation
be
given
a
true
democracy
was
there
still
hope
if
there
was
never
had
the
been
more
needed
than
now
it
had
told
the
truth
about
political
corruption
today
it
had
to
fight
it
we
are
not
divided
now
into
those
who
know
and
those
who
do
not
know
we
are
divided
now
into
those
who
care
and
those
who
do
not
care
thus
wrote
chesterton
in
an
article
about
his
own
continued
editorship
of
the
paper
politics
would
never
have
been
my
province
either
in
the
highest
or
the
lowest
sense
i
have
hitherto
known
myself
to
be
merely
a
but
my
action
or
rather
inaction
as
a
has
come
terribly
to
an
end
that
gap
will
never
be
filled
now
till
god
restores
all
the
noble
ruin
that
we
name
the
world
and
the
wisest
know
best
that
the
gap
will
yawn
as
hopelessly
in
the
history
of
england
as
in
the
story
of
our
private
lives
i
must
now
either
accept
this
duty
entirely
or
abandon
it
entirely
i
will
not
abandon
it
for
every
instinct
and
nerve
of
intelligence
i
have
tells
me
that
this
is
a
time
when
it
must
not
be
abandoned
i
must
accept
a
comparison
that
must
be
a
contrast
and
a
crushing
contrast
but
though
i
can
never
be
so
good
as
my
brother
i
will
see
if
i
can
be
better
than
myself
the
same
attacks
on
financiers
and
others
constantly
reiterated
might
well
have
put
gilbert
in
the
dock
where
his
brother
had
stood
but
i
think
the
upshot
of
the
case
against
cecil
had
not
been
entirely
encouraging
to
the
winners
then
too
immense
popularity
made
such
an
attack
a
still
more
doubtful
move
cecil
had
been
less
than
gilbert
but
far
better
known
than
a
fraser
and
a
beamish
a
pair
of
cranks
against
whom
sir
alfred
mond
brought
a
libel
action
in
for
having
in
a
placard
shown
in
a
window
in
a
back
street
called
him
a
traitor
and
accused
him
of
having
traded
with
the
enemy
in
this
case
sir
alfred
mond
of
the
mond
nickel
company
giving
evidence
said
that
he
always
disregarded
charges
made
by
irresponsible
persons
charges
had
been
made
against
him
in
the
which
was
edited
by
gilbert
chesterton
all
the
world
regarded
chesterton
as
but
he
was
certainly
amusing
and
he
the
witness
had
read
most
of
his
books
he
had
once
procured
with
some
difficulty
a
copy
of
the
witness
his
lordship
did
chesterton
charge
the
witness
with
being
a
traitor
smith
counsel
for
the
defence
yes
in
the
witness
irresponsible
was
not
quite
the
the
unfortunate
fraser
and
beamish
were
not
of
the
metal
to
win
that
or
any
case
in
that
or
any
court
there
was
a
kind
of
solemn
buffoonery
in
choosing
these
two
as
responsible
opponents
in
preference
to
the
irresponsible
chesterton
at
any
rate
damages
of
were
given
against
them
which
gives
some
measure
of
the
risk
took
in
making
exactly
the
same
attacks
gilbert
had
not
so
much
natural
buoyancy
as
cecil
he
got
far
less
fun
out
of
making
these
attacks
still
less
had
he
the
recklessness
that
made
cecil
indifferent
even
to
the
charge
of
inaccuracy
that
charge
was
in
fact
the
only
one
that
gilbert
feared
writing
to
a
contributor
whose
article
he
had
held
back
in
order
to
verify
an
accusation
made
in
it
gilbert
remarked
that
he
had
no
fear
of
a
lawsuit
when
he
was
certain
of
his
facts
he
did
not
fear
fine
or
imprisonment
he
had
one
fear
only
i
am
afraid
of
being
answered
there
was
another
thing
he
feared
hurting
or
distressing
his
friends
this
was
especially
a
danger
for
one
so
many
of
whose
friends
were
also
his
opponents
in
politics
or
religion
and
who
was
now
editing
a
paper
of
so
controversial
a
character
with
wells
he
had
a
real
bond
of
affection
and
an
interesting
correspondence
with
and
about
him
illustrates
all
gilbert
qualities
consideration
for
his
subordinates
for
his
friendships
concern
for
the
integrity
of
his
paper
sense
of
responsibility
to
cecil
memory
during
an
editorial
absence
the
assistant
editor
titterton
had
accepted
a
series
of
articles
called
big
little
wells
from
edwin
pugh
which
seemed
to
be
turning
into
an
attack
on
wells
instead
of
an
appreciation
chesterton
wrote
to
titterton
and
simultaneously
to
wells
himself
dear
wells
the
sudden
demands
of
other
duties
which
i
really
could
not
see
how
to
avoid
has
prevented
my
attending
to
the
lately
and
i
have
only
just
heard
on
the
telephone
that
you
have
written
a
letter
to
the
paper
touching
an
unfortunate
difference
between
you
and
edwin
pugh
i
do
yet
know
the
contents
of
your
letter
but
of
course
i
have
told
my
that
it
is
to
be
printed
whatever
it
is
this
week
or
next
i
am
really
exceedingly
distressed
to
have
been
out
of
the
business
at
the
time
but
if
you
knew
the
circumstances
i
think
you
would
see
the
difficulty
and
my
editorial
absence
has
not
been
a
holiday
as
it
is
i
agreed
to
the
general
idea
of
a
study
of
your
work
by
pugh
and
i
confess
it
never
even
crossed
my
mind
that
anybody
would
write
such
a
thing
except
as
a
tribute
to
your
genius
and
the
intellectual
interest
of
the
subject
nor
can
i
believe
it
now
it
may
strike
you
as
so
ironical
as
to
be
incredible
but
it
is
really
one
of
those
ironies
that
are
also
facts
that
i
rather
welcomed
the
idea
of
a
criticism
in
the
paper
which
so
often
differs
from
you
from
a
modernist
and
collectivist
standpoint
more
like
your
own
i
should
imagine
pugh
would
agree
with
you
more
than
i
do
and
not
less
i
will
not
prejudge
the
quarrel
till
i
understand
more
of
it
but
i
now
write
at
once
to
tell
you
that
i
would
not
dream
of
tolerating
anything
meant
to
be
a
mere
personal
attack
on
you
even
if
i
resigned
my
post
on
the
point
and
i
had
already
written
to
the
office
to
say
so
but
i
do
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
pugh
means
any
such
thing
i
regarded
him
as
a
strong
wellsian
and
even
more
of
an
admirer
than
myself
though
he
might
be
so
modern
as
to
use
a
familiar
and
mixed
method
of
portraiture
which
is
too
modern
for
my
tastes
but
which
many
use
besides
he
for
the
moment
i
suggest
a
possible
misunderstanding
which
he
may
well
correct
by
a
further
explanation
i
had
said
something
myself
in
my
weekly
article
demurring
to
a
possible
undervaluing
of
you
long
before
i
heard
of
your
own
letter
even
when
i
am
in
closer
touch
with
things
of
course
many
things
appear
in
the
paper
with
which
i
wholly
disagree
but
the
notion
of
a
mere
campaign
against
you
would
always
have
seemed
to
me
as
abominable
and
absurd
as
it
does
now
i
do
not
believe
any
one
can
entertain
it
and
certainly
i
do
not
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
you
anything
that
can
fairly
be
shown
to
be
justice
whether
it
were
explanation
or
apology
or
anything
else
this
is
all
i
can
say
without
your
letter
and
pugh
side
of
the
case
but
i
feel
i
should
say
this
at
once
yours
sincerely
chesterton
i
have
arranged
for
your
letter
to
appear
in
next
number
but
i
may
have
more
light
on
pugh
attitude
by
then
to
titterton
he
wrote
i
do
hope
this
work
will
not
turn
into
anything
that
looks
like
a
mere
attack
on
wells
especially
in
the
rather
realistic
and
personal
modern
manner
which
i
am
perhaps
too
victorian
myself
to
care
very
much
about
i
do
not
merely
feel
this
because
i
have
managed
to
keep
wells
as
a
friend
on
the
whole
i
feel
it
much
more
and
i
know
you
are
a
man
to
understand
such
sentiments
because
i
have
a
sort
of
sense
of
honour
about
him
as
an
enemy
or
at
least
a
potential
enemy
we
are
so
certain
to
collide
in
controversial
warfare
that
i
have
a
horror
of
his
thinking
i
would
attack
him
with
anything
but
fair
controversial
weapons
my
feeling
is
so
entirely
consistent
with
a
faith
in
pugh
motives
as
well
as
an
admiration
of
his
talents
that
i
honestly
believe
i
could
explain
this
to
him
without
offence
i
am
honestly
in
a
very
difficult
position
on
the
because
it
is
physically
impossible
for
me
really
to
edit
it
and
also
do
enough
outside
work
to
be
able
to
edit
it
unpaid
as
well
as
having
a
little
over
to
give
it
from
time
to
time
what
we
should
have
done
without
the
loyalty
and
capacity
of
you
and
a
few
others
i
ca
imagine
i
can
not
oversee
everything
that
goes
into
the
paper
i
can
not
resign
without
dropping
as
you
truly
said
the
work
of
a
great
man
who
is
gone
and
who
i
feel
would
wish
me
to
continue
it
it
is
like
what
stevenson
said
about
marriage
and
its
duties
there
is
no
refuge
for
you
not
even
suicide
but
i
should
have
to
consider
even
resignation
if
i
felt
that
the
acceptance
of
pugh
generosity
really
gave
him
the
right
to
print
something
that
i
really
felt
bound
to
disapprove
it
may
be
that
i
am
needlessly
alarmed
over
a
slip
or
two
of
the
pen
in
vivid
descriptions
of
a
very
odd
character
and
that
pugh
really
admires
his
big
little
as
much
as
i
thought
he
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
business
if
the
general
impression
on
the
reader
mind
is
of
the
big
wells
and
not
the
little
wells
i
think
the
doubt
i
mean
would
really
be
met
somehow
the
letter
to
titterton
got
into
the
hands
of
a
hennessy
who
after
gilbert
death
sent
it
to
wells
wells
wrote
thank
you
very
much
for
that
letter
of
it
is
exactly
like
him
from
first
to
last
he
and
i
were
very
close
friends
and
never
for
a
moment
did
i
consider
him
responsible
for
pathetic
and
silly
little
outbreak
i
never
knew
anyone
so
steadily
true
to
form
as
besides
the
cleansing
of
public
life
two
other
things
were
seen
as
vital
by
the
the
restoration
of
property
and
the
restoration
of
liberty
under
the
heading
reconstruction
of
property
belloc
set
out
a
series
of
proposals
highly
practical
and
very
far
from
what
is
usually
called
revolutionary
that
savings
for
instance
made
on
a
small
scale
should
be
helped
by
a
very
high
rate
of
interest
that
the
purchase
by
small
men
of
small
parcels
of
land
or
businesses
or
houses
should
be
freed
from
legal
charges
while
these
should
be
made
heavier
for
those
who
purchased
on
a
large
scale
thus
encouraging
small
property
and
checking
huge
accumulation
he
pointed
out
how
vast
sums
could
be
found
for
such
subsidies
out
of
the
money
spent
today
on
an
education
which
the
poor
detested
for
their
children
and
which
most
of
the
wealthy
admitted
to
be
an
abject
failure
most
of
those
he
noted
who
oppose
distributism
do
so
on
the
ground
that
the
proposals
are

his
own
were
certainly
practical
and
would
by
many
be
called
reactionary
but
he
admitted
one
doubt
besides
the
overwhelming
difficulty
of
turning
the
current
of
modern
socialism
the
doubt
whether
englishmen
from
long
disuse

anarchic
future
which
the
more
timid
tories
professed
to
fear

already

upon

by
ignorant
people
the
old
aristocracy
of
england
in
his
view
had
made
many
mistakes
but
certain
things
they
had
understood
very
well
the
modern
governing
class
can
not
face
a
fact
or
follow
an
argument
or
feel
a
tradition
but
least
of
all
can
they
upon
any
persuasion
read
through
a
plain
impartial
book
english
or
foreign
that
is
not
specially
written
to
soothe
their
panic
or
to
please
their
pride
there
had
been
reality
in
the
claim
of
the
old
aristocracy
to
understand
matters
not
known
to
the
people
they
had
read
history
they
were
familiar
with
other
languages
and
other
lands
they
had
a
great
tradition
of
foreign
diplomacy
even
the
study
of
philosophy
and
theology
today
confined
to
a
handful
of
experts
was
not
alien
to
them
on
all
this
had
rested
what
right
they
had
to
govern
but
today
they
rule
them
by
the
smiling
terror
of
an
ancient
secret
they
smile
and
smile
but
they
have
forgotten
the
secret
on
the
other
hand
the
ordinary
workman
had
the
advantage
over
his
probably
millionaire
master
by
the
necessity
of
knowing
something
he
must
be
able
to
use
his
tools
he
must
know
enough
arithmetic
to
know
when
prices
have
risen
the
hard
business
of
living
taught
him
something
give
him
a
chance
of
more
through
property
and
liberty
and
see
what
he
will
build
on
that
foundation
the
war
had
already
shown
not
only
the
courage
of
our
men
but
their
contrivance
their
trench

and
jests
their
initiative
as
sailors
and
as

the
little

that

have
been
fanned
into
a
flame
was
crushed

an
episode
of
a
few
years
later

illustrates
the
spirit
chesterton
was
fighting
in
a
threat
arose
to
the
traffic
monopoly
from

who
put
their

gratuities
into
the
purchase
of

they
drove

the

general

decided
to
crush
them
and
with
the
aid
of
a
government
commission
succeeded
chesterton
paper
followed
the
struggle
with
passionate
interest
just
as
he
believed
that
the
small
shop
actually
served
the
public
better
than
the
large
so
too
he
believed
that
these
would
serve
it
better
than
the
combine
but
if
it
could
have
been
proved
that
the
combine
was
more
efficient
gilbert
would
still
have
championed
the
independents
it
was
better
for
the
community
that
men
should
take
responsibility
and
initiative
for
themselves
even
if
the
work
could
be
done
more
efficiently
by
wage
slaves
to
his
dismay
he
found
that
the
trade
unions
did
not
dream
of
applying
this
test
and
that
they
were
aligned
against
the
pirates
as
the
independent
owners
were
usually
called
he
had
always
been
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
trade
unions
to
him
it
had
seemed
they
were
trying
to
do
the
work
of
the
ancient
guilds
under
far
more
difficult
conditions
but
after
the
war
for
the
first
time
a
little
note
of
doubt
creeps
into
his
voice
when
he
is
speaking
of
them
they
were
still
vocal
for
the
rights
of
labour
but
they
had
begun
to
lay
stress
exclusively
on
the
less
important
of
those
rights
writing
of
the
loss
of
the
allotments
he
suggested
in
one
article
that
the
trades
unions
might
well
use
some
part
of
their
funds
in
purchasing
land
to
be
held
in
perpetuity
by
their
members
but
i
doubt
if
he
much
expected
that
they
would
do
so
many
trade
unionists
were
working
for
the
bus
company
and
were
more
concerned
about
their
conditions
of
work
than
about
the
handful
of
drivers
who
were
their
own
masters
but
the
unions
had
begun
to
stress
almost
solely
the
question
of
hours
and
of
wages
to
fight
for
good
conditions
but
no
longer
for
control
or
ownership
to
demand
security
but
to
agree
to
abandon
many
of
their
rights
in
return
it
was
a
chill
fear
and
for
long
he
resisted
it
but
in
these
terrible
years
it
had
begun
to
shake
him
were
the
people
of
england
losing
the
appetite
for
freedom
and
for
property
were
the
trades
unions
from
lack
of
leadership
and
confusion
of
thought
beginning
to
accept
the
servile
state

via
jerusalem
shortly
after
the
war
gilbert
and
frances
set
out
on
their
travels
going
in
to
palestine
home
through
italy
early
in
and
starting
out
again
the
following
year
for
a
lecture
tour
in
the
united
states
to
his
friendship
with
maurice
baring
gilbert
owed
their
being
able
to
make
the
first
of
these
journeys
as
well
as
much
else
the
picture
entitled
conversation
piece
of
chesterton
belloc
and
baring
is
well
known
was
it
chesterton
himself
who
christened
it
baring
overbearing
and
past
bearing
many
elements
united
the
three
in
a
close
friendship
love
of
literature
love
of
europe
a
common
view
of
the
philosophy
of
history
and
of
life
frances
chesterton
often
said
that
of
all
her
husband
friends
she
thought
there
was
none
he
loved
better
than
maurice
baring
they
often
wrote
ballades
together
a
french
form
which
they
with
phillimore
and
others
had
in
english
a
telegram
from
gilbert
refusing
a
celebration
runs
like
a
refrain
prince
yorkshire
holds
me
now
by
yorkshire
hams
i
fed
i
ca
assist
your
row
i
send
ballades
instead
these
ballades
urbane
were
a
feature
in
the
but
many
of
those
the
three
friends
composed
were
strictly
not
for
publication
but
recited
to
friends
behind
closed
doors
gilbert
memory
was
useful
he
knew
all
his
own
and
the
others
once
belloc
forgot
the
envoi
to
one
of
his
own
ballades
and
gilbert
finished
it
for
him
even
to
maurice
baring
wrote
less
often
than
he
intended
and
one
apologetic
ballade
carries
the
refrain
i
write
no
letters
to
the
men
i
love
i
have
always
fancied
that
maurice
baring
gave
gilbert
the
idea
for
his
story
man
who
knew
too
first
in
the
diplomatic
service
then
doing
splendidly
as
an
airman
in
the
war
a
member
of
the
great
banking
family
related
to
most
of
the
aristocracy
and
intimate
with
most
of
the
rest
he
is
like
the
hero
of
the
book
in
a
sort
of
detachment
a
slight
irony
about
a
world
that
he
has
not
cared
to
conquer
impossible
for
a
mere
acquaintance
to
say
whether
he
views
that
world
with
all
the
disillusionment
of
hero
but
anyhow
such
a
suggestion
from
life
is
never
more
than
a
hint
for
creative
art
another
side
is
seen
in
the
in
the
stories
of
maurice
baring
plunging
into
the
sea
in
evening
dress
on
the
occasion
of
his
fiftieth
birthday
and
of
the
smashing
by
gilbert
of
a
that
became
in
retrospect
a
priceless
goblet
which
had
stood
by
charlemagne
great
chair
and
served
peter
at
high
mass
and
now
inspired
the
refrain
i
like
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
a
good
deal
of
glass
was
broken
by
the
stones
of
this
group
of
men
whose
own
house
was
made
of
tolerably
strong
materials
there
is
quite
a
bundle
of
baring
letters
to
gilbert
and
in
spite
of
the
apologetic
ballade
a
fair
number
of
answers
two
of
these
last
are
written
early
in
the
second
of
which
opens
the
question
of
the
jerusalem
visit
may
my
dear
maurice
i
am
the
prince
of
unremembered
towers
destroyed
before
the
birth
of
babylon
i
am
also
the
writer
of
unremembered
letters
and
to
a
much
greater
extent
the
designer
and
imaginer
of
unwritten
letters
and
i
can
not
remember
whether
i
ever
acknowledged
properly
your
communications
about
claudel
especially
your
interesting
remarks
about
the
comparative
coolness
of
henri
de
regnier
about
him
it
struck
me
because
i
think
it
is
part
of
something
i
have
noticed
myself
a
curious
and
almost
premature
conservatism
in
the
older
generation
of
revolutionaries
particularly
when
they
were
pagan
revolutionaries
not
that
i
suppose
de
regnier
is
particularly
old
or
in
the
stock
sense
a
revolutionist
but
i
think
you
will
know
the
break
between
the
generations
to
which
i
refer
i
remember
having
exactly
the
same
experience
the
only
time
i
ever
talked
to
swinburne
i
had
regarded
and
resisted
him
in
my
boyhood
as
a
sort
of
antichrist
in
purple
like
nero
holding
his
lyre
and
i
found
him
more
like
a
very
victorian
old
maid
almost
entirely
a
temporis
disposed
to
say
that
none
of
the
young
men
would
ever
come
up
to
tennyson
which
may
be
quite
true
for
all
i
know
i
fancy
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
very
fact
that
their
revolt
was
pagan
and
being
temporal
was
also
temporary
when
that
particular
fashion
in
caps
of
liberty
has
gone
out
they
have
nothing
to
fall
back
on
but
the
feeling
which
swinburne
himself
puts
into
the
mouth
of
the
pagan
on
the
day
when
constantine
issued
the
proclamation
but
to
me
their
new
device
is
barren
the
days
are
bare
things
long
gone
over
suffice
and
men
forgotten
that
were
i
only
tell
you
all
this
because
you
might
find
it
amusing
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
as
well
as
the
where
there
is
a
small
repetition
of
the
same
thing
bernard
shaw
has
written
an
article
which
is
supposed
to
be
about
his
view
of
me
and
socialism
but
which
may
be
said
more
truly
to
be
about
his
blindness
to
hilary
and
his
servile
state
it
is
quite
startling
to
me
to
find
how
wholly
he
misses
hilary
point
and
how
wildly
he
falls
back
on
a
sort
of
elderly
impatience
with
our
juvenile
paradox
and
fantasticality
i
shall
answer
him
as
abusively
as
my
great
personal
liking
for
him
will
allow
and
i
think
hilary
is
going
to
do
the
same
so
if
you
ever
see
such
papers
you
might
enjoy
the
fun
yours
always
chesterton
dear
maurice
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
your
interesting
letter
i
think
you
are
right
every
time
about
gosse
and
claudel
or
rather
about
claudel
and
gosse
for
though
i
think
gosse
a
very
valuable
old
victorian
in
his
way
i
do
not
think
he
is
on
the
same
scale
as
the
things
that
have
lately
been
happening
in
the
world
and
claudel
is
one
of
them
he
has
happened
like
a
great
gun
going
off
and
i
think
i
saw
a
line
of
his
on
the
subject
of
such
a
discharge
of
artillery
in
the
war
it
ran
and
that
which
goes
forth
is
france
terrible
as
the
holy
ghost
i
doubt
if
gosse
has
ever
seen
that
france
even
in
a
flash
and
a
bang
i
do
see
how
he
could
remember
the
religion
in
which
he
grew
up
by
his
own
very
graphic
account
of
it
a
man
is
not
entirely
emancipated
from
such
very
positive
puritanism
by
anything
so
negative
as
agnosticism
nothing
but
a
religion
can
cast
out
a
religion
being
so
sensitive
on
behalf
of
renan
is
simply
not
understanding
the
great
historical
passions
about
a
heresiarch
it
means
that
famous
intellectuals
must
not
hate
each
other
because
they
all
belong
to
the
saville
club
please
do
not
think
i
mean
merely
that
gosse
is
a
snob
i
think
he
is
a
jolly
old
gentleman
and
a
good
critic
of
french
poetry
but
not
of
dei
per
your
points
against
him
are
quite
logical
i
suppose
the
controversy
will
not
be
conducted
in
public
or
i
should
feel
inclined
to
join
in
it
anyhow
i
wish
it
could
be
continued
between
us
as
a
conversation
in
private
for
i
have
long
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
serious
things
meanwhile
as
not
wholly
unconnected
with
the
serious
things
could
you
possibly
do
me
a
great
favour
it
is
very
far
from
being
the
first
great
favour
you
have
done
me
and
i
should
fear
that
anyone
less
magnanimous
would
fancy
i
only
wrote
to
you
about
such
things
but
the
situation
is
this
an
excellent
offer
has
been
made
to
me
to
write
a
book
about
jerusalem
not
political
but
romantic
and
religious
so
to
speak
i
conceive
it
as
mostly
about
pilgrimages
and
crusades
in
poetical
prose
and
working
up
to
allenby
great
entrance
the
offer
includes
money
to
go
to
jerusalem
but
can
not
include
all
the
political
or
military
permissions
necessary
to
go
there
i
have
another
motive
for
wanting
to
go
there
which
is
much
stronger
than
the
desire
to
write
the
book
though
i
do
think
i
could
do
it
in
the
right
way
and
what
matters
more
on
the
right
side
frances
is
to
come
with
me
and
all
the
doctors
in
creation
tell
her
she
can
only
get
rid
of
her
neuritis
if
she
goes
to
some
such
place
and
misses
part
of
an
english
winter
i
would
do
anything
to
bring
it
off
for
that
reason
alone
you
are
a
man
who
knows
everybody
do
you
know
anybody
on
allenby
staff
or
know
anybody
who
knows
anybody
on
allenby
staff
or
know
anybody
who
would
know
anybody
who
would
know
anything
about
it
i
am
told
that
it
can
not
be
done
as
yet
in
the
ordinary
way
by
cook
and
that
the
oracle
must
be
worked
in
some
such
fashion
if
you
should
be
so
kind
as
to
refer
to
any
worried
soldier
or
official
i
should
like
it
understood
that
i
am
not
nosing
about
touching
any
diplomatic
or
military
matter
france
in
syria
or
any
copy
for
the
i
only
want
to
write
rhetoric
on
the
spot
if
you
could
possibly
help
in
this
matter
i
really
think
you
would
be
helping
things
you
yourself
care
about
and
one
person
not
myself
who
deserves
it
i
will
not
say
it
would
be
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
which
might
seem
a
tragic
metaphor
but
bringing
one
bird
at
least
to
life
and
allowing
the
other
bird
who
is
a
goose
to
go
on
a
wild
yours
always
chesterton
it
was
much
needed
change
and
refreshment
for
both
gilbert
and
frances
her
diary
shows
a
vivid
enjoyment
of
all
the
scenes
and
happenings
going
into
the

of

with
a
door
so
low
you
can
hardly
get
in
this
done
to
prevent
the
cattle
from
straying
in
seeing
camels
on
the
roof
of
a
convent
standing
godmother
to
an
armenian
carpenter
baby
the
officiator
in
a
cape
of
white
silk
embroidered
in
gold
and
a
wonderful
crown
supposed
to
represent
the
temple
the
godfather
a
young
man
was
in
a
red
velvet
gown
after
a
good
many
prayers
and
much
chanting
the
babe
beautifully
dressed
was
taken
to
the
font
which
was
in
the
side
of
the
wall
and
there
were
more
prayers
and
chanting
then
cushions
were
laid
on
the
floor
and
the
child
undressed
all
of
us
assisting
at
this
point
i
was
asked
to
stand
godmother
and
gladly
consented
the
baby
by
this
time
quite
naked
was
handed
to
the
priest
who
immersed
him
completely
under
the
water
three
times
giving
him
the
name
of
pedros
peter
before
being
he
was
anointed
with
oil
the
forebead
eyes
nose
mouth
ears
heart
hands
and
feet
all
being
signed
with
the
cross
the
child
was
by
this
time
crying
lustily
and
it
was
some
business
to
get
him
dressed
especially
as
he
was
swaddled
in
bands
very
completely
when
ready
he
was
handed
to
me
and
he
lay
stiff
in
my
arms
whilst
i
held
two
large
lighted
candles
i
followed
the
priest
from
the
font
to
the
little
altar
where
a
chain
and
a
little
gold
cross
were
bound
round
his
head
signifying
that
he
was
now
a
christian
then
the
priest
touched
his
lips
with
the
sacramental
wafer
and
touched
his
nose
with
myrrh
after
the
blessing
we
left
the
church
in
a
procession
the
godfather
carrying
the
baby
at
the
threshold
of
the
house
the
priest
took
it
and
delivered
it
to
the
mother
who
sat
waiting
for
it
also
holding
the
two
candles
again
the
priests
muttered
a
few
prayers
and
blessed
mother
child
and
godparents
the
father
is
an
armenian
carpenter
by
trade
very
nice
people
mother
very
pretty
the
parents
insisted
that
we
should
stay
for
refreshments
and
we
were
handed
a
very
nice
liquor
in
lovely
little
glasses
and
a
very
beautiful
sort
of
pastry
afterwards
cups
of
weak
tea
and
cakes
the
various
rites
and
ceremonies
in
jerusalem
interested
frances
deeply
but
the
diary
shows
no
awareness
of
the
differences
that
separated
the
various
kinds
of
christians
the
diary
ends
with
the
return
through
rome
where
she
and
i
met
to
the
surprise
of
both
of
us
in
the
street
while
a
friend
travelling
with
them
met
my
mother
both
meetings
were
miraculous
frances
comments
since
the
letters
to
my
mother
during
gilbert
illness
in
we
had
heard
no
more
about
his
spiritual
pilgrimage
there
was
much
eager
talk
at
this
meeting
but
no
opportunity
occurred
and
certainly
none
was
sought
for
any
confidences
as
we
waved
goodbye
after
their
departing
train
my
mother
said
thoughtfully
frances
did
rather
play
off
jerusalem
against
rome
did
she
in
fact
as
we
learned
later
this
visit
to
jerusalem
had
been
a
determining
factor
in
gilbert
conversion
many
people
both
in
and
outside
the
church
had
been
wondering
what
had
so
long
delayed
him
the
mental
progress
from
the
vague
liberalism
of
the
to
the
splendid
edifice
of
had
been
a
swift
one
for
the
book
was
written
in
and
already
several
years
earlier
in
and
in
his
newspaper
contests
with
blatchford
gilbert
chesterton
had
shown
his
firm
belief
in
the
godhead
of
our
lord
in
sacraments
in
priesthood
and
in
the
authority
of
the
church
but
it
was
not
yet
the
catholic
and
roman
church
there
is
a
revealing
passage
in
the
and
then
i
happened
to
meet
lord
hugh
cecil
i
met
him
at
the
house
of
wilfrid
ward
that
great
clearing
house
of
philosophies
and
theologies
i
listened
to
lord
hugh
very
lucid
statements
of
his
position
the
strongest
impression
i
received
was
that
he
was
a
protestant
i
was
myself
still
a
thousand
miles
from
being
a
catholic
but
i
think
it
was
the
perfect
and
solid
protestantism
of
lord
hugh
that
fully
revealed
to
me
that
i
was
no
longer
a
protestant
the
time
that
thousand
miles
took
is
a
real
problem
the
years
before
the
illness
during
which
he
talked
of
joining
the
church
the
seven
further
years
before
he
joined
it
cecil
chesterton
had
been
received
before
the
war
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
marconi
case
in
fact
and
the
entire
outlook
of
both
brothers
had
seemed
to
make
this
inevitable
not
only
theologically
but
sociologically
and
historically
alike
in
their
outlook
on
europe
today
or
on
the
great
ages
of
the
past
it
was
a
catholic
civilisation
based
on
catholic
theology
that
seemed
to
them
the
only
true
one
for
a
full
and
rich
human
development
i
think
in
this
matter
a
special
quality
and
its
defect
could
be
seen
in
gilbert
for
most
people
intensity
of
thought
is
much
more
difficult
than
action
with
him
it
was
the
opposite
he
used
his
mind
unceasingly
his
body
as
little
as
possible
i
remember
one
day
going
to
see
them
when
he
had
a
sprained
ankle
and
learning
from
frances
how
happy
it
made
him
because
nobody
could
bother
him
to
take
exercise
the
whole
of
practical
life
he
left
to
her
but
joining
the
church
was
not
only
something
to
be
thought
about
it
was
something
really
practical
that
had
to
be
done
and
here
frances
could
not
help
him
he
will
need
frances
said
father
to
my
mother
to
take
him
to
church
to
find
his
place
in
his
to
examine
his
conscience
for
him
when
he
goes
to
confession
he
will
never
take
all
those
hurdles
unaided
frances
never
lifted
a
finger
to
prevent
gilbert
from
joining
the
catholic
church
but
obviously
before
she
was
convinced
herself
she
could
not
help
him
the
absence
of
help
was
in
this
case
a
very
positive
hindrance
i
remember
one
day
on
a
picnic
gilbert
coming
up
to
me
with
a
very
disconsolate
expression
and
asking
where
frances
was
i
said
i
do
know
but
i
can
easily
find
her
do
you
want
her
he
answered
i
do
want
her
now
but
i
may
want
her
at
any
minute
many
men
depend
upon
their
wives
but
very
few
men
admit
it
so
frankly
and
if
he
was
unpractical
to
a
point
almost
inconceivable
frances
herself
could
be
called
practical
only
in
comparison
with
him
the
confused
mass
of
papers
through
which
she
had
to
hunt
to
find
some
important
document
lingers
in
the
memory
another
element
that
made
action
lag
behind
conviction
with
chesterton
was
his
perpetual
state
of
overwork
physically
inactive
his
mind
was
never
barren
but
issued
in
an
immense
output
several
books
every
year
besides
editing
and
articles
there
were
even
two
years
in
which
no
fewer
than
six
books
were
published
to
focus
his
attention
on
the
deepest
matters
it
was
vital
to
escape
from
the
net
of
work
and
worry
returning
from
jerusalem
gilbert
wrote
from
alexandria
to
maurice
baring
my
dear
maurice
to
quote
a
poet
we
agree
in
thinking
ridiculously
underrated
by
recent
fashions
my
boat
is
on
the
shore
and
my
bark
is
on
the
sea
but
before
i
go
tom
moore
if
i
may
so
by
a
flight
of
fancy
describe
you
i
feel
impelled
to
send
you
this
hurried
line
to
thank
you
so
far
as
this
atrocious
hotel
pen
will
allow
me
for
the
wonderful
time
i
have
had
in
palestine
which
is
so
largely
owing
to
you
there
is
also
something
even
more
important
i
want
very
much
to
discuss
with
you
because
of
certain
things
that
have
been
touched
on
between
us
in
former
times
i
will
only
say
here
that
my
train
of
thought
which
really
was
one
of
thought
and
not
fugitive
emotion
came
to
an
explosion
in
the
church
of
the
ecce
homo
in
jerusalem
a
church
which
the
guidebooks
call
new
and
the
newspapers
call
latin
i
fear
it
may
be
at
least
a
month
before
we
meet
for
the
journey
takes
a
fortnight
and
may
be
prolonged
by
a
friend
ill
in
paris
and
i
must
work
the
moment
i
return
to
keep
a
contract
but
if
we
could
meet
by
about
then
i
could
thank
you
better
for
many
things
yours
illegibly
chesterton
the
contract
that
had
to
be
kept
was
in
all
probability
the
writing
of
new
it
is
a
glorious
book
until
i
read
them
more
carefully
i
had
always
accepted
own
view
that
books
of
travel
were
a
weak
spot
in
his
multifarious
output
he
said
of
himself
that
he
always
tended
to
see
such
enormous
significance
in
every
detail
that
he
might
just
as
well
describe
railway
signals
near
beaconsfield
as
the
light
of
sunset
over
the
golden
horn
but
new
is
no
mere
book
of
description
it
is
the
book
of
a
man
seeing
a
vision
to
understand
how
this
vision
broke
upon
him
we
have
first
to
try
to
understand
something
jealously
hidden
by
gilbert
chesterton
his
own
suffering
even
as
a
boy
in
the
days
of
the
toothache
and
still
more
torturing
earache
he
had
written
though
pain
be
stark
and
bitter
and
days
in
darkness
creep
not
to
that
depth
i
sink
me
that
asks
the
world
to
weep
so
much
did
he
acclaim
himself
enrolled
under
the
banner
of
joy
that
i
think
most
people
miss
the
companion
picture
to
the
favourite
one
of
the
happy
warrior
no
warrior
can
fight
untiringly
through
a
long
lifetime
without
wounds
without
temptations
to
abandon
the
struggle
and
seek
a
less
glorious
peace
if
in
what
are
commonly
called
practical
matters
chesterton
was
weak
he
was
in
this
almost
superhumanly
strong
his
fame
did
not
rest
upon
success
in
the
field
of
sociology
and
politics
he
could
have
increased
it
by
neglecting
the
good
of
england
for
which
he
fought
and
living
in
literature
poetry
and
fantasy
here
all
acclaimed
him
great
whereas
most
tolerated
or
despised
as
a
hobby
or
a
weakness
the
work
he
was
pouring
into
the
fight
for
england
in
this
time
after
the
armistice
it
was
by
a
naked
effort
of
the
will
that
he
held
his
ground
the
loss
of
cecil
with
his
courage
his
energy
and
buoyancy
was
immeasurable
and
i
know
for
we
talked
of
it
together
that
frances
had
not
the
complete
sympathy
with
gilbert
over
the
paper
that
she
had
over
his
other
work
it
seemed
to
her
too
great
a
drain
on
his
time
and
energy
it
made
the
writing
of
his
important
books
more
difficult
she
would
not
she
told
me
try
to
stop
it
as
she
knew
how
much
he
cared
but
she
would
have
rejoiced
if
he
had
chosen
to
let
it
go
and
the
fight
that
he
had
almost
enjoyed
in
cecil
company
had
become
a
harder
one
not
merely
because
he
was
alone
but
because
the
nature
of
the
foe
had
changed
he
was
fighting
now
not
individual
abuses
but
the
mood
of
pessimism
that
had
overtaken
our
civilisation
in
an
article
entitled
it
too
late
he
defined
this
pessimism
as
a
paralysis
of
the
mind
an
impotence
intrinsically
unworthy
of
a
free
man
he
stated
powerfully
the
case
of
those
who
held
that
our
civilisation
was
dying
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
make
any
further
efforts
the
future
belongs
to
those
who
can
find
a
real
answer
to
that
real
case
the
omens
and
the
auguries
are
against
us
there
is
no
answer
but
one
that
omens
and
auguries
are
heathen
things
and
that
we
are
not
heathens
we
are
not
lost
unless
we
lose
ourselves
great
alfred

the
darkness
of

ninth
century

down
on
his
copy
of
boethius
his
denial
of
the
doctrine
of
fate
we
who
have
been
brought
up
to
see
all
the
signs
of
the
times
pointing
to
improvement
may
live
to
see
all
the
signs
in
heaven
and
earth
pointing
the
other
way
if
we
go
on
it
must
be
in
another
name
than
that
of
the
goddess
of
fortune
it
was
that
other
name
in
which
he
had
so
long
believed
that
he
realised
with
the
freshness
of
novelty
on
this
journey
to
jerusalem
he
made
in
the
holy
city
and
in
the
fields
of
palestine
a
new
discovery
of
christ
and
of
the
christian
thing
as
he
looked
over
the
dead
sea
and
almost
physically
realised
what
evil
meant
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
divine
deliverer
saying
to
the
demons
go
forth
and
trouble
him
not
any
more
in
the
cave
at
bethlehem
he
realised
the
little
local
infancy
whereby
the
creator
of
the
world
had
chosen
to
redeem
the
world
all
through
the
book
there
are
glimpses
of
what
he
tells
more
fully
in
everlasting
between
the
two
books
all
that
he
had
seen
and
thought
in
palestine
lay
in
his
mind
and
grew
there
and
fructified
for
our
understanding
but
he
had
seen
it
all
in
that
first
vision
jerusalem
first
impressed
chesterton
as
a
mediaeval
city
and
from
its
turrets
he
could
readily
picture
godfrey
de
bouillon
richard
the
and
saint
louis
of
france
through
the
crusades
he
views
what
was
meant
by
christendom
and
sets
over
against
it
at
once
the
greatness
and
the
barrenness
of
islam
the
moslem
had
one
thought
and
that
a
most
vital
one
the
greatness
of
god
which
levels
all
men
but
the
moslem
had
not
one
thought
to
rub
against
another
because
he
really
had
not
another
it
is
the
friction
of
two
spiritual
things
of
tradition
and
invention
or
of
substance
and
symbol
from
which
the
mind
takes
fire
the
creeds
condemned
as
complex
have
something
like
the
secret
of
sex
they
can
breed
thoughts
today
we
of
christendom
have
fallen
below
ourselves
but
yet
we
have
something
left
of
the
power
to
create
whether
it
be
a
theology
or
a
civilisation
talking
to
an
old
arab
in
the
desert
chesterton
heard
him
say
that
in
all
these
years
of
turkish
rule
the
turks
had
never
given
to
the
people
a
cup
of
cold
water
and
as
the
old
man
spoke
he
heard
the
clank
of
pipes
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
english
soldiers
who
were
bringing
water
through
the
desert
to
jerusalem
a
chapter
on
zionism
discusses
with
sympathy
to
both
parties
the
difficulties
of
the
jewish
settlement
in
palestine
in
palestine
he
found
his
jewish
friend
and
on
the
eder
who
had
gone
there
ardent
in
the
cause
of
zionism
and
chesterton
himself
remained
convinced
that
some
system
akin
to
zionism
was
the
only
possible
solution
of
this
enormous
problem
possibly
a
system
of
jewish
cantons
in
various
countries
but
he
was
equally
convinced
that
the
english
government
was
destroying
the
chances
of
success
for
zionism
by
sending
jews
as
governors
in
england
name
to
that
or
any
other
eastern
country
even
in
this
book
there
is
struck
at
times
a
note
of
the
doom
he
feared
was
overhanging
us
he
heard
islam
crying
from
the
turret
and
israel
wailing
from
the
wall
and
yet
he
seemed
too
to
hear
a
voice
from
all
the
peoples
of
jerusalem
bidding
us
weep
not
for
them
who
have
faith
and
clarity
and
a
purpose
but
weep
for
ourselves
and
for
our
children
in
his
fighting
articles
he
had
asserted
the
supremacy
of
the
human
will
over
fate
in
this
book
he
sees
how
that
will
must
be
renewed
purified
and
made
once
more
mighty
by
the
same
power
that
built
the
ancient
civilisation
of
christendom
jerusalem
gave
to
chesterton
the
fuller
realisation
of
two
great
facts
first
he
saw
that
the
supernatural
was
needed
not
only
to
conquer
the
powers
of
evil
but
even
to
restore
the
good
things
that
should
be
natural
to
man
as
he
put
it
in
the
later
book
nature
may
not
have
the
name
of
isis
isis
may
not
be
really
looking
for
osiris
but
it
is
true
that
nature
is
really
looking
for
something
nature
is
always
looking
for
the
supernatural
yet
man
even
strengthened
by
the
supernatural
can
not
suffice
for
the
fight
without
a
leader
who
is
more
than
man
in
the
land
of
christ
childhood
his
teaching
and
his
suffering
there
came
to
gilbert
chesterton
a
vision
more
vivid
than
a
man
walking
unveiled
upon
the
mountains
seen
of
men
and
seeing
a
visible
god
all
visions
must
fade
into
the
light
of
common
day
and
the
return
home
meant
the
resumption
of
hard
labour
for
the
moment
wrote
gilbert
to
maurice
baring
as
balzac
said
i
am
labouring
like
a
miner
in
a
landslide
normally
i
would
let
it
slide
but
if
i
did
in
this
case
i
should
break
two
or
three
really
important
contracts
which
i
find
i
have
returned
from
jerusalem
just
in
time
to
save
a
few
years
later
when
sheed
and
ward
started
gilbert
wanted
to
write
a
number
of
books
for
us
to
publish
his
secretary
found
that
he
had
then
thirty
books
contracted
for
with
a
variety
of
publishers
he
had
got
home
in
april
and
a
lecture
tour
was
planned
for
the
united
states
at
the
beginning
of
the
following
year
the
eight
months
between
saw
the
completion
and
publication
of
uses
of
collected
essays
new
and
superstition
of
and
still
went
on
the
the
london
articles
introductions
lectures
conferences
two
letters
to
maurice
baring
clearly
belong
to
these
months
my
dear
maurice
i
am
so
awfully
distressed
to
hear
you
are
unwell
again
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
even
to
bother
you
with
my
sentiments
beyond
my
sympathy
but
if
it
is
not
too
late
or
too
early
i
will
call
on
you
early
next
week
probably
monday
but
i
will
let
you
know
for
certain
before
then
i
would
have
called
on
you
long
ago
let
alone
written
but
for
this
load
of
belated
work
which
really
seems
to
bury
me
day
after
day
i
never
realised
before
that
business
can
really
block
out
much
bigger
things
as
you
may
possibly
guess
i
want
to
consider
my
position
about
the
biggest
thing
of
all
whether
i
am
to
be
inside
it
or
outside
it
i
used
to
think
one
could
be
an
and
really
inside
it
but
if
that
was
to
use
an
excellent
phrase
of
your
own
only
a
porch
i
do
not
think
i
want
a
porch
and
certainly
not
a
porch
standing
some
way
from
the
building
a
porch
looks
so
silly
standing
all
by
itself
in
a
field
since
then
unfortunately
there
have
sprung
up
round
it
real
ties
and
complications
and
difficulties
difficulties
that
seemed
almost
duties
but
i
will
not
bother
you
with
all
that
now
and
i
particularly
do
not
want
you
to
bother
yourself
especially
to
answer
this
unless
you
want
to
i
know
i
have
your
sympathy
and
please
god
i
shall
get
things
straight
sometimes
one
suspects
the
real
obstacles
have
been
the
weaknesses
one
knows
to
be
wrong
and
not
the
doubts
that
might
be
relatively
right
or
at
least
rational
i
suppose
all
this
is
a
common
story
and
i
hope
so
for
wanting
to
be
uncommon
is
really
not
one
of
my
weaknesses
they
are
worse
probably
but
they
are
not
that
there
are
other
and
in
the
ordinary
sense
more
cheerful
things
i
would
like
to
talk
of
things
i
think
we
could
both
do
for
causes
we
certainly
agree
about
meanwhile
thank
you
for
everything
and
be
sure
i
think
of
you
very
much
yours
always
chesterton
my
dear
maurice
this
is
the
shortest
hastiest
and
worst
written
letter
in
the
world
it
only
tells
you
three
things
that
i
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
the
book
that
i
have
to
leave
for
america
for
a
month
or
two
earlier
than
i
expected
but
i
am
glad
for
i
shall
see
something
of
frances
without
walls
of
work
between
us
and
that
i
have
pretty
well
made
up
my
mind
about
the
thing
we
talked
about
fortunately
the
thing
we
talked
about
can
be
found
all
over
the
world
yours
always
chesterton
i
will
not
write
here
of
the
american
scene
but
will
talk
of
it
in
a
later
chapter
along
with
the
second
tour
gilbert
made
in
the
states
it
seems
best
to
complete
now
the
story
of
his
journey
of
the
mind
a
reserved
man
tells
more
of
himself
indirectly
than
directly
readers
of
the
complain
that
it
is
concerned
with
everything
in
the
world
except
chesterton
you
can
certainly
search
its
pages
in
vain
for
any
account
of
the
process
of
his
conversion
for
that
you
must
look
elsewhere
in
the
poems
to
our
lady
in
catholic
church
and
in
well
and
the
and
in
the
letters
here
to
be
quoted
in
catholic
church
and
he
sketches
the
three
phases
through
which
most
converts
pass
all
of
which
he
had
himself
experienced
he
sums
them
up
as
patronizing
the
church
discovering
the
church
and
running
away
from
the
church
in
the
first
phase
a
man
is
taking
trouble
and
taking
trouble
has
certainly
never
been
a
particular
weakness
of
mine
to
find
out
the
fallacy
in
most
ideas
in
the
second
stage
he
is
gradually
discovering
the
great
ideas
enshrined
in
the
church
and
hitherto
hidden
from
him
it
is
these
numberless
glimpses
of
great
ideas
that
have
been
hidden
from
the
convert
by
the
prejudices
of
his
provincial
culture
that
constitute
the
adventurous
and
varied
second
stage
of
the
conversion
it
is
broadly
speaking
the
stage
in
which
the
man
is
unconsciously
trying
to
be
converted
and
the
third
stage
is
perhaps
the
truest
and
most
terrible
it
is
that
in
which
the
man
is
trying
not
to
be
converted
he
has
come
too
near
to
the
truth
and
has
forgotten
that
truth
is
a
magnet
with
the
powers
of
attraction
and
repulsion
catholic
church
and
p
to
a
certain
extent
it
is
a
fear
which
attaches
to
all
sharp
and
irrevocable
decisions
it
is
suggested
in
all
the
old
jokes
about
the
shakiness
of
the
bridegroom
at
the
wedding
or
the
recruit
who
takes
the
shilling
and
gets
drunk
partly
to
celebrate
but
partly
also
to
forget
it
but
it
is
the
fear
of
a
fuller
sacrament
and
a
mightier
army
p
the
man
has
exactly
the
same
sense
of
having
committed
or
compromised
himself
or
having
been
in
a
sense
entrapped
even
if
he
is
glad
to
be
entrapped
but
for
a
considerable
time
he
is
not
so
much
glad
as
simply
terrified
it
may
be
that
this
real
psychological
experience
has
been
misunderstood
by
stupider
people
and
is
responsible
for
all
that
remains
of
the
legend
that
rome
is
a
mere
trap
but
that
legend
misses
the
whole
point
of
the
psychology
it
is
not
the
pope
who
has
set
the
trap
or
the
priests
who
have
baited
it
the
whole
point
of
the
position
is
that
the
trap
is
simply
the
truth
the
whole
point
is
that
the
man
himself
has
made
his
way
towards
the
trap
of
truth
and
not
the
trap
that
has
run
after
the
man
all
steps
except
the
last
step
he
has
taken
eagerly
on
his
own
account
out
of
interest
in
the
truth
and
even
the
last
step
or
the
last
stage
only
alarms
him
because
it
is
so
very
true
if
i
may
refer
once
more
to
a
personal
experience
i
may
say
that
i
for
one
was
never
less
troubled
by
doubts
than
in
the
last
phase
when
i
was
troubled
by
fears
before
that
final
delay
i
had
been
detached
and
ready
to
regard
all
sorts
of
doctrines
with
an
open
mind
since
that
delay
has
ended
in
decision
i
have
had
all
sorts
of
changes
in
mere
mood
and
i
think
i
sympathise
with
doubts
and
difficulties
more
than
i
did
before
but
i
had
no
doubts
or
difficulties
just
before
i
had
only
fears
fears
of
something
that
had
the
finality
and
simplicity
of
suicide
but
the
more
i
thrust
the
thing
into
the
back
of
my
mind
the
more
certain
i
grew
of
what
thing
it
was
and
by
a
paradox
that
does
not
frighten
me
now
in
the
least
it
may
be
that
i
shall
never
again
have
such
absolute
assurance
that
the
thing
is
true
as
i
had
when
i
made
my
last
effort
to
deny
it
pp
the
whole
of
catholic
theology
can
be
justified
says
gilbert
if
you
are
allowed
to
start
with
those
two
ideas
that
the
church
is
popularly
supposed
to
oppose
reason
and
liberty
to
become
a
catholic
is
not
to
leave
off
thinking
but
to
learn
how
to
think
it
is
so
in
exactly
the
same
sense
in
which
to
recover
from
palsy
is
not
to
leave
off
moving
but
to
learn
how
to
move
the
convert
has
learnt
long
before
his
conversion
that
the
church
will
not
force
him
to
abandon
his
will
but
he
is
not
unreasonably
dismayed
at
the
extent
to
which
he
may
have
to
use
his
will
this
was
the
crux
for
gilbert
there
is
in
the
last
second
of
time
or
hairbreadth
of
space
before
the
iron
leaps
to
the
magnet
an
abyss
full
of
all
the
unfathomable
forces
of
the
universe
the
space
between
doing
and
not
doing
such
a
thing
is
so
tiny
and
so
vast
father
maturin
said
after
his
conversion
that
for
at
least
ten
years
before
it
the
question
had
never
been
out
of
his
mind
for
ten
waking
minutes
it
was
about
ten
years
since
gilbert
had
first
talked
to
father
of
his
intention
to
join
the
church
but
in
his
case
thought
on
the
subject
could
not
have
been
so
continuous
still
he
had
time
for
patronising
discovery
and
running
away
all
in
leisurely
fashion
external
efforts
to
help
him
had
been
worse
than
useless
as
he
indicates
in
catholic
church
and
they
had
always
put
him
back
gilbert
could
not
be
hustled
says
maurice
baring
of
his
whole
habit
of
mind
and
body
you
could
fluster
gilbert
but
not
hustle
him
says
father
they
were
both
too
wise
to
try
in
two
letters
gilbert
said
that
the
two
people
who
helped
him
most
at
this
time
were
maurice
baring
and
father
ronald
knox
who
had
both
gone
through
the
same
experience
themselves
besides
the
positive
mental
processes
of
recognition
repulsion
and
attraction
exercised
by
the
church
gilbert
was
affected
to
some
extent
both
by
affection
for
the
church
of
england
and
disappointment
with
it
the
profound
joy
of
his
early
conversion
to
christianity
was
linked
with
anglicanism
and
so
too
were
many
friendships
and
the
continued
attachment
to
it
of
frances
but
what
he
said
to
maurice
baring
about
a
porch
is
representative
like
father
maturin
he
felt
he
owed
so
much
to
his
anglican
friends
he
hated
to
stress
overmuch
the
revulsion
from
anglicanism
in
the
process
of
conversion
but
it
did
at
this
date
contribute
to
the
converging
arguments
he
wrote
to
maurice
baring
so
many
thanks
for
the
sermons
which
i
will
certainly
return
as
you
suggest
i
had
the
other
day
a
trying
experience
and
i
think
a
hard
case
of
casuistry
i
am
not
sure
that
i
was
right
but
also
not
by
any
means
sure
i
was
wrong
long
ago
before
my
present
crisis
i
had
promised
somebody
to
take
part
in
what
i
took
to
be
a
small
debate
on
labour
too
late
by
my
own
carelessness
i
found
to
my
horror
it
had
swelled
into
a
huge
congress
at
the
albert
hall
i
tried
to
get
out
of
it
but
i
was
held
to
my
promise
then
i
reflected
that
i
could
only
write
as
i
was
already
writing
to
my
friends
on
the
basis
that
i
was
one
of
them
now
in
doubt
about
continuing
such
and
that
their
conference
in
some
sense
served
the
same
purpose
as
their
letters
what
affected
me
most
however
was
that
by
my
own
fault
i
had
put
them
into
a
hole
otherwise
i
would
not
just
now
speak
from
or
for
their
platform
just
as
i
could
not
as
yet
at
any
rate
speak
from
or
for
yours
so
i
spoke
very
briefly
saying
something
of
what
i
think
about
social
ethics
whether
or
not
my
decision
was
right
my
experience
was
curious
and
suggestive
though
tragic
for
i
felt
it
like
a
farewell
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
enthusiasm
of
those
thousands
of
but
there
was
also
no
doubt
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
that
many
of
them
besides
myself
would
be
roman
catholics
rather
than
accept
things
they
are
quite
likely
to
be
asked
to
accept
for
instance
by
the
lambeth
conference
for
though
my
own
distress
as
in
most
cases
i
suppose
has
much
deeper
grounds
than
clerical
decisions
yet
if
i
can
not
stay
where
i
am
it
will
be
a
sort
of
useful
symbol
that
the
english
church
has
done
something
decisively
protestant
or
pagan
i
mean
that
to
those
to
whom
i
can
not
give
my
spiritual
biography
i
can
say
that
the
insecurity
i
felt
in
anglicanism
was
typified
in
the
lambeth
conference
i
am
at
least
sure
that
much
turns
on
that
conference
if
not
for
me
for
large
numbers
of
those
people
at
the
albert
hall
a
young
curate
has
just
told
me
that
the
crowd
there
cheered
all
references
to
the
pope
and
laughed
at
every
mention
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
it
a
queer
state
of
things
i
am
concerned
most
however
about
somebody
i
value
more
than
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
frances
to
whom
i
owe
much
of
my
own
faith
and
to
whom
therefore
as
far
as
i
can
see
my
way
i
also
owe
every
decent
chance
for
the
controversial
defence
of
her
faith
if
her
side
can
convince
me
they
have
a
right
to
do
so
if
not
i
shall
go
hot
and
strong
to
convince
her
i
put
it
clumsily
but
there
is
a
point
in
my
mind
logically
therefore
i
must
await
answers
from
waggett
and
gore
as
well
as
knox
and
mcnabb
and
talk
the
whole
thing
over
with
her
and
then
act
as
i
believe
this
is
a
dusty
political
sort
of
letter
with
nothing
in
it
but
what
i
think
and
nothing
of
what
i
feel
for
that
side
of
it
i
can
only
express
myself
by
asking
for
your
prayers
the
accident
of
his
having
to
speak
at
this
congress
where
he
was
received
with
enormous
enthusiasm
probably
led
to
a
fuller
analysis
of
this
element
in
his
thought
i
put
here
a
letter
he
wrote
to
maurice
baring
soon
after
his
conversion
because
it
sums
up
the
anglican
question
as
he
finally
saw
it
please
forgive
me
for
the
delay
but
i
have
been
caught
in
a
cataract
of
letters
and
work
in
connection
with
the
new
paper
we
are
trying
to
start
and
am
now
dictating
this
under
conditions
that
make
it
impossible
for
it
to
resemble
anything
so
personal
and
intimate
as
the
great
unwritten
epistle
to
which
you
refer
but
i
will
note
down
here
very
hurriedly
and
in
a
more
impersonal
way
some
of
the
matters
that
have
affected
me
in
relation
to
the
great
problem
to
begin
with
i
am
shy
of
giving
one
of
my
deepest
reasons
because
it
is
hard
to
put
it
without
offence
and
i
am
sure
it
is
the
wrong
method
to
offend
the
wavering
but
i
believe
one
of
my
strongest
motives
was
mixed
up
with
the
idea
of
honour
i
feel
there
is
something
mean
about
not
making
complete
confession
and
restitution
after
a
historic
error
and
slander
it
is
not
the
same
thing
to
withdraw
the
charges
against
rome
one
by
one
or
restore
the
traditions
to
canterbury
one
by
one
suppose
a
young
prig
refuses
to
live
with
his
father
or
his
friend
or
his
wife
because
wine
is
drunk
in
the
house
or
there
are
greek
statues
in
the
hall
suppose
he
goes
off
on
his
own
and
develops
broader
ideas
on
the
day
he
drinks
his
first
glass
of
wine
i
think
it
is
essential
to
his
honour
that
he
should
go
back
to
his
father
or
his
friend
and
say
you
are
right
and
i
was
wrong
and
we
will
drink
wine
together
it
is
not
consonant
with
his
honour
that
he
should
set
up
a
house
of
his
own
with
wine
and
statues
and
every
parallel
particular
and
still
treat
the
other
as
if
he
were
in
the
wrong
that
is
mean
because
it
is
making
the
best
of
both
it
is
combining
the
advantages
of
being
right
with
the
advantages
of
having
been
wrong
any
analogy
is
imperfect
but
i
think
you
see
what
i
mean
the
larger
version
of
this
is
that
england
has
really
got
into
so
wrong
a
state
with
its
plutocracy
and
neglected
populace
and
materialistic
and
servile
morality
that
it
must
take
a
sharp
turn
that
will
be
a
sensational
turn
no
into
catholicism
will
have
that
moral
effect
christianity
is
the
religion
of
repentance
it
stands
against
modern
fatalism
and
pessimistic
futurism
mainly
in
saying
that
a
man
can
go
back
if
we
do
decidedly
go
back
it
will
show
that
religion
is
alive
for
the
rest
i
do
not
say
much
about
the
details
of
continuity
and
succession
because
the
truth
is
they
did
not
much
affect
me
what
i
see
is
that
we
can
not
complain
of
england
suffering
from
being
protestant
and
at
the
same
time
claim
that
she
has
always
been
catholic
that
there
has
always
been
a
high
church
party
is
true
that
there
has
always
been
an
party
may
be
true
but
i
am
not
so
sure
of
it
but
there
is
one
matter
arising
from
that
which
i
do
think
important
even
the
high
church
party
even
the
party
only
confronts
a
particular
heresy
called
protestantism
upon
particular
points
it
defends
ritual
rightly
or
even
sacramentalism
rightly
because
these
are
the
things
the
puritans
attacked
if
it
is
not
the
heresy
of
an
age
at
least
it
is
only
the
of
an
age
but
since
i
have
been
a
catholic
i
have
become
conscious
of
being
in
a
much
vaster
arsenal
full
of
arms
against
countless
other
potential
enemies
the
church
as
the
church
and
not
merely
as
ordinary
opinion
has
something
to
say
to
philosophies
which
the
merely
high
church
has
never
had
occasion
to
think
about
if
the
next
movement
is
the
very
reverse
of
protestantism
the
church
will
have
something
to
say
about
it
or
rather
has
already
something
to
say
about
it
you
might
unite
all
high
churchmen
on
the
high
church
quarrel
but
what
authority
is
to
unite
them
when
the
devil
declares
his
next
war
on
the
world
another
quality
that
impresses
me
is
the
power
of
being
decisive
first
and
being
proved
right
afterwards
this
is
exactly
the
quality
a
supernatural
power
would
have
and
i
know
nothing
else
in
modern
religion
that
has
it
for
instance
there
was
a
time
when
i
should
have
thought
psychical
enquiry
the
most
reasonable
thing
in
the
world
and
rather
favourable
to
religion
i
was
afterwards
convinced
by
experience
and
not
merely
faith
that
spiritualism
is
a
practical
poison
do
people
see
that
that
is
found
in
experience
a
prodigious
prestige
accrues
to
the
authority
which
long
before
the
experiment
did
not
pretend
to
enquire
but
simply
said
drop
it
we
feel
that
the
authority
did
not
discover
it
knew
there
are
a
hundred
other
things
of
which
that
story
is
true
in
my
own
experience
but
the
high
churchman
has
a
perfect
right
to
be
a
spiritualistic
enquirer
only
he
has
not
a
right
to
claim
that
his
authority
knew
beforehand
the
truth
about
spiritualistic
enquiry
of
course
there
are
a
hundred
things
more
to
say
indeed
the
greatest
argument
for
catholicism
is
exactly
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
argue
for
it
it
is
the
scale
and
multiplicity
of
the
forms
of
truth
and
help
that
it
has
to
offer
and
perhaps
after
all
the
only
thing
that
you
and
i
can
really
say
with
profit
is
exactly
what
you
yourself
suggested
that
we
are
men
who
have
talked
to
a
good
many
men
about
a
good
many
things
and
seen
something
of
the
world
and
the
philosophies
of
the
world
and
that
we
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
about
what
was
the
wisest
act
of
our
lives
this
letter
as
we
have
seen
was
written
afterwards
meanwhile
the
story
of
the
last
slow
but
by
no
means
uncertain
steps
is
best
told
in
a
series
of
undated
letters
to
father
ronald
knox
dear
father
knox
it
is
hard
not
to
have
a
silly
feeling
that
demons
in
the
form
of
circumstances
get
in
the
way
of
what
concerns
one
most
and
i
have
been
distracted
with
details
for
which
i
have
to
be
responsible
in
connection
with
the
which
is
in
a
crisis
about
which
shareholders
etc
have
to
be
consulted
i
ca
let
my
paper
that
stands
for
all
he
believed
in
go
without
doing
all
i
can
and
i
am
trying
to
get
it
started
again
with
belloc
to
run
it
if
possible
but
the
matter
of
our
meeting
has
got
into
every
chink
of
my
thoughts
even
the
pauses
of
talk
on
practical
things
i
could
not
explain
myself
at
that
meeting
and
i
want
to
try
again
now
i
could
not
explain
what
i
mean
about
my
wife
without
saying
much
more
i
see
in
principle
it
is
not
on
the
same
level
as
the
true
church
for
nothing
can
be
on
the
same
level
as
god
but
it
is
on
quite
a
different
level
from
social
sentiments
about
friends
and
family
i
have
been
a
rottenly
irresponsible
person
till
i
began
to
wear
the
iron
ring
of
catholic
responsibilities
but
i
really
have
felt
a
responsibility
about
her
more
serious
than
affection
let
alone
passion
first
because
she
gave
me
my
first
respect
for
sacramental
christianity
second
because
she
is
one
of
the
good
who
mysteriously
suffer
i
have
however
a
more
practical
reason
for
returning
to
this
point
so
far
as
my
own
feelings
go
i
think
i
might
rightly
make
application
to
be
instructed
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
should
not
like
to
take
so
serious
a
step
without
reopening
the
matter
with
her
which
i
could
do
by
the
end
of
a
week
i
have
had
no
opportunity
before
because
she
has
only
just
recovered
from
an
illness
and
is
going
away
for
a
few
days
but
at
about
the
end
of
next
week
say
everything
ought
to
be
ready
meanwhile
i
will
write
to
you
again
as
i
ought
to
have
done
before
but
this
tangle
of
business
ties
me
up
terribly
just
now
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
how
i
could
arrange
matters
with
some
priest
or
religious
in
london
whose
convenience
it
would
suit
if
i
came
up
once
or
twice
a
week
or
whatever
is
required
or
give
me
the
address
of
someone
to
write
to
if
that
is
the
correct
way
there
are
priests
at
high
wycombe
which
is
nearer
but
i
imagine
they
are
very
busy
parochial
clergy
i
had
meant
to
write
to
you
about
the
convictions
involved
in
a
more
abstract
way
but
i
fear
i
have
filled
my
letter
with
one
personal
point
but
as
i
say
i
will
write
to
you
again
about
the
other
matters
and
as
they
are
more
intellectual
and
less
emotional
i
hope
i
may
be
a
little
more
coherent
yours
very
sincerely
chesterton
this
has
been
delayed
even
longer
than
i
thought
for
business
bothers
of
my
own
and
the
paper
plus
finishing
a
book
and
all
my
journalism
are
bewildering
me
terribly
dear
father
knox
please
excuse
this
journalistic
paper
but
the
seems
undiscoverable
at
this
time
of
night
i
ought
to
have
written
before
but
we
have
been
in
some
family
trouble
my
father
is
very
ill
and
as
he
is
an
old
man
my
feelings
are
with
him
and
my
mother
in
a
way
more
serious
than
anything
except
the
matter
of
our
correspondence
essentially
of
course
it
does
not
so
much
turn
the
current
of
my
thoughts
as
deepen
it
to
see
a
man
so
many
million
times
better
than
i
am
in
every
way
and
one
to
whom
i
owe
everything
under
such
a
shadow
makes
me
feel
on
top
of
all
my
particular
feelings
the
shadow
that
lies
on
us
all
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
feel
of
course
but
i
hope
i
may
ask
for
your
prayers
for
my
people
and
for
me
my
father
is
the
very
best
man
i
ever
knew
of
that
generation
that
never
understood
the
new
need
of
a
spiritual
authority
and
lives
almost
perfectly
by
the
sort
of
religion
men
had
when
rationalism
was
rational
i
think
he
was
always
subconsciously
prepared
for
the
next
generation
having
less
theology
than
he
has
and
is
rather
puzzled
at
its
having
more
but
i
think
he
understood
my
brother
conversion
better
than
my
mother
did
she
is
more
difficult
and
of
course
i
can
not
bother
her
just
now
however
my
trouble
has
a
practical
side
for
which
i
originally
mentioned
it
as
this
may
bring
me
to
london
more
than
i
thought
it
seems
possible
i
might
go
there
after
all
instead
of
wycombe
if
i
knew
to
whom
to
go
also
i
find
i
stupidly
destroyed
your
letter
with
the
names
of
the
priests
at
wycombe
to
whom
you
referred
me
would
it
bother
you
very
much
to
send
me
the
names
again
and
any
alternative
london
ones
that
occur
to
you
and
i
will
let
you
know
my
course
of
action
then
please
forgive
the
disorder
of
my
writing
and
feeling
yours
sincerely
chesterton
dear
father
knox
i
was
just
settling
down
three
days
ago
to
write
a
full
reply
to
your
last
very
kind
letter
which
i
should
have
answered
long
before
when
i
received
the
wire
that
called
me
instantly
to
town
my
father
died
on
monday
and
since
then
i
have
been
doing
the
little
i
can
for
my
mother
but
even
that
little
involves
a
great
deal
of
business
the
least
valuable
sort
of
help
i
will
not
attempt
to
tell
you
now
all
that
this
involves
in
connection
with
my
deeper
feelings
and
intentions
for
i
only
send
you
this
interim
scribble
as
an
excuse
for
delaying
the
letter
i
had
already
begun
and
which
nothing
less
than
this
catastrophe
would
have
prevented
me
finishing
i
hope
to
finish
it
in
a
few
days
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
shall
then
be
back
in
beaconsfield
but
if
so
it
will
be
at
a
new
address
top
meadow
beaconsfield
yours
in
haste
chesterton
dear
father
knox
i
feel
horribly
guilty
in
not
having
written
before
and
i
do
most
earnestly
hope
you
have
not
allowed
my
delay
to
interfere
with
any
of
your
own
arrangements
i
have
had
a
serious
and
very
moving
talk
with
my
wife
and
she
is
only
too
delighted
at
the
idea
of
your
visit
in
itself
in
fact
she
really
wants
to
know
you
very
much
unfortunately
it
does
not
seem
very
workable
at
the
time
to
which
i
suppose
you
referred
i
imagine
it
more
or
less
corresponds
to
next
week
and
we
have
only
one
spare
bedroom
yet
which
is
occupied
by
a
nurse
who
is
giving
my
wife
a
treatment
that
seems
to
be
doing
her
good
and
which
i
do
want
to
stop
if
i
can
help
it
i
am
sure
you
will
believe
that
my
regret
about
this
difficulty
is
really
not
the
conventional
apology
though
heaven
knows
all
sorts
of
apologies
are
due
to
you
touching
the
other
idea
of
lady
lovat
most
generous
invitation
i
am
not
so
sure
as
that
again
depends
at
the
moment
on
the
treatment
but
of
course
i
shall
let
lady
lovat
know
very
soon
in
any
case
and
make
other
arrangements
as
you
suggested
in
our
conversation
my
wife
was
all
that
i
hope
you
will
some
day
know
her
to
be
she
is
incapable
of
wanting
me
to
do
anything
but
what
i
think
right
and
admits
the
same
possibility
for
herself
but
it
is
much
more
of
a
wrench
for
her
for
she
has
been
able
to
practise
her
religion
in
complete
good
faith
which
my
own
doubts
have
prevented
me
from
doing
i
will
write
again
very
soon
yours
sincerely
chesterton
i
am
ashamed
to
say
this
has
been
finished
fully
hours
after
i
meant
it
to
go
owing
to
executor
business
nobody
so
unbusinesslike
as
i
am
ought
to
be
busy
dear
father
knox
this
is
only
a
wild
and
hasty
line
to
show
i
have
not
forgotten
and
to
ask
you
if
it
would
be
too
late
if
i
let
you
know
in
a
day
or
two
touching
your
generous
suggestion
about
your
vacation
i
shall
know
for
certain
i
think
at
latest
by
the
end
of
the
week
but
just
at
the
moment
it
depends
on
things
still
uncertain
about
a
nurse
who
is
staying
here
giving
my
wife
a
treatment
of
radiant
heat
one
would
hardly
think
needed
in
this
weather
but
it
seems
to
be
doing
her
good
i
am
thankful
to
say
if
this
is
pushing
your
great
patience
too
far
please
do
not
hesitate
to
make
other
arrangements
if
you
wish
to
and
i
shall
no
doubt
be
able
to
do
the
same
but
i
should
love
to
accept
your
suggestion
if
possible
yours
sincerely
chesterton
dear
father
knox
just
as
i
am
emerging
from
the
hurricane
of
business
i
mentioned
to
you
i
find
myself
under
a
promise
a
year
old
to
go
and
lecture
for
a
week
in
holland
and
i
write
this
almost
stepping
on
to
the
boat
i
do
in
the
least
want
to
go
but
i
suppose
the
great
question
is
there
as
elsewhere
indeed
i
hear
it
is
something
of
a
reconquered
territory
some
say
a
third
of
this
heroic
calvinist
state
is
now
catholic
i
have
no
time
to
write
properly
but
the
truth
is
that
even
before
so
small
a
journey
i
have
a
queer
and
perhaps
superstitious
feeling
that
i
should
like
to
repeat
to
you
my
intention
of
following
the
example
of
the
worthy
calvinists
please
god
so
that
you
could
even
cite
it
if
there
were
ever
need
in
a
good
cause
i
will
write
to
you
again
and
more
fully
about
the
business
of
instruction
when
i
return
which
should
be
in
about
ten
days
yours
always
sincerely
chesterton
dear
father
knox
i
ought
to
have
written
long
ago
to
tell
you
what
i
have
done
about
the
most
practical
of
business
matters
i
have
again
been
torn
in
pieces
by
the
wars
of
the
but
i
have
managed
to
have
another
talk
with
my
wife
after
which
i
have
written
to
our
old
friend
father
and
asked
him
to
come
here
as
he
probably
can
from
what
i
hear
i
doubt
whether
i
can
possibly
put
in
words
why
i
feel
sure
this
is
the
right
thing
not
so
much
for
my
sake
as
for
hers
we
talk
about
misunderstandings
but
i
think
it
is
possible
to
understand
too
well
for
comfort
certainly
too
well
for
my
powers
of
psychological
description
frances
is
just
at
the
point
where
rome
acts
both
as
the
positive
and
the
negative
magnet
a
touch
would
turn
her
either
way
almost
against
her
will
to
hatred
but
with
the
right
touch
to
a
faith
far
beyond
my
reach
i
know
father
would
be
the
touch
that
does
not
startle
because
she
knows
him
and
is
fond
of
him
and
the
only
thing
she
asked
of
me
was
to
send
for
him
if
he
can
not
come
of
course
i
shall
take
other
action
and
let
you
know
i
doubt
if
most
people
could
make
head
or
tail
of
this
hasty
scrawl
but
i
think
you
will
understand
yours
sincerely
chesterton
father
knox
wrote
on
july
i
awfully
glad
to
hear
that
you
sent
for
father
and
that
you
think
he
likely
to
be
available
i
must
say
that
in
the
story
father
brown
powers
of
neglecting
his
parish
always
seemed
to
me
even
more
admirable
than
watson
powers
of
neglecting
his
practice
so
i
hope
this
trait
was
drawn
from
the
life
father
has
described
the
two
days
before
the
reception
on
thursday
morning
on
one
of
our
trips
to
the
village
i
told
chesterton
is
only
one
thing
troubling
gilbert
about
the
great
step
the
effect
it
is
going
to
have
on
you
i
shall
be
infinitely
relieved
you
can
not
imagine
how
it
fidgets
gilbert
to
have
anything
on
his
mind
the
last
three
months
have
been
exceptionally
trying
i
should
be
only
too
glad
to
come
with
him
if
god
in
his
mercy
would
show
the
way
clear
but
up
to
now
he
has
not
made
it
clear
enough
to
me
to
justify
such
a
step
so
i
was
able
to
reassure
gilbert
that
afternoon
we
discussed
at
large
such
special
points
as
he
wished
and
then
i
told
him
to
read
through
the
penny
catechism
to
make
sure
there
were
no
snags
to
a
prosperous
passage
it
was
a
sight
for
men
and
angels
all
the
friday
to
see
him
wandering
in
and
out
of
the
house
with
his
fingers
in
the
leaves
of
the
little
book
resting
it
on
his
forearm
whilst
he
pondered
with
his
head
on
one
side
the
ceremony
took
place
in
a
kind
of
shed
with
corrugated
iron
roof
and
wooden
walls
a
part
of
the
railway
hotel
for
at
this
time
beaconsfield
had
no
catholic
church
father
ignatius
rice
another
old
and
dear
friend
came
over
from
the
abbey
at
douai
to
join
father
at
breakfast
at
the
inn
and
they
afterwards
walked
up
together
to
top
meadow
what
follows
is
from
notes
made
by
my
husband
of
a
conversation
with
father
rice
they
found
gilbert
in
an
armchair
reading
the
catechism
pulling
faces
and
making
noises
as
he
used
to
do
when
reading
he
got
up
and
stuffed
the
catechism
in
his
pocket
at
lunch
he
drank
water
and
poured
wine
for
everyone
else
about
three
they
set
out
for
the
church
suddenly
father
asked
if
he
had
brought
the
ritual
plunged
his
hand
in
his
pocket
pulled
out
a
threepenny
shocker
with
complete
absence
of
embarrassment
and
went
on
searching
till
at
last
he
found
the
prayer
book
while
was
making
his
confession
to
father
frances
and
father
rice
went
out
of
the
chapel
and
sat
on
the
yokels
bench
in
the
bar
of
the
inn
she
was
weeping
after
the
baptism
the
two
priests
came
out
and
left
gilbert
and
frances
inside
father
rice
went
back
for
something
he
had
forgotten
and
he
saw
them
coming
down
the
aisle
she
was
still
weeping
and
gilbert
had
his
arm
round
her
comforting
her
he
wrote
the
sonnet
on
his
conversion
that
day
he
was
in
brilliant
form
for
the
rest
of
the
day
quoting
poetry
and
jesting
in
the
highest
spirits
he
joined
the
church
to
restore
his
innocence
sin
was
almost
the
greatest
reality
to
him
he
became
a
catholic
because
of
the
practical
power
of
dealing
with
sin
immediately
he
wrote
to
his
mother
and
to
maurice
baring
who
had
anxiously
feared
he
had
perhaps
offended
gilbert
so
long
was
it
since
he
had
heard
from
him
my
dearest
mother
i
write
this
with
the
worst
pen
in
south
bucks
to
tell
you
something
before
i
write
about
it
to
anyone
else
something
about
which
we
shall
probably
be
in
the
position
of
the
two
bosom
friends
at
oxford
who
never
differed
except
in
opinion
you
have
always
been
so
wise
in
not
judging
people
by
their
opinions
but
rather
the
opinions
by
the
people
it
is
in
one
sense
a
long
story
by
this
time
but
i
have
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
cecil
did
about
needs
of
the
modern
world
in
religion
and
right
dealing
and
i
am
now
a
catholic
in
the
same
sense
as
he
having
long
claimed
the
name
in
its
sense
i
am
not
going
to
make
a
foolish
fuss
of
reassuring
you
about
things
i
am
sure
you
never
doubted
these
things
do
not
hurt
any
relations
between
people
as
fond
of
each
other
as
we
are
any
more
than
they
ever
made
any
difference
to
the
love
between
cecil
and
ourselves
but
there
are
two
things
i
should
like
to
tell
you
in
case
you
do
not
realise
them
through
some
other
impression
i
have
thought
about
you
and
all
that
i
owe
to
you
and
my
father
not
only
in
the
way
of
affection
but
of
the
ideals
of
honour
and
freedom
and
charity
and
all
other
good
things
you
always
taught
me
and
i
am
not
conscious
of
the
smallest
break
or
difference
in
those
ideals
but
only
of
a
new
and
necessary
way
of
fighting
for
them
i
think
as
cecil
did
that
the
fight
for
the
family
and
the
free
citizen
and
everything
decent
must
now
be
waged
by
the
one
fighting
form
of
christianity
the
other
is
that
i
have
thought
this
out
for
myself
and
not
in
a
hurry
of
feeling
it
is
months
since
i
saw
my
catholic
friends
and
years
since
i
talked
to
them
about
it
i
believe
it
is
the
truth
i
must
end
now
you
know
with
how
much
love
for
the
post
is
going
always
your
loving
son
gilbert
dear
maurice
my
abominable
delay
deserves
every
penalty
conceivable
hanging
burning
and
boiling
in
oil
but
really
not
so
inconceivable
an
idea
as
that
i
should
be
offended
with
you
at
any
time
let
alone
after
all
you
have
done
in
this
matter
however
thoroughly
you
might
be
justified
in
being
offended
with
me
really
and
truly
my
delay
indefensible
as
it
is
was
due
to
a
desire
and
hope
of
writing
you
a
letter
quite
different
from
all
those
i
have
had
to
write
to
other
people
a
very
long
and
intimate
letter
trying
to
tell
you
all
about
this
wonderful
business
in
which
you
have
helped
me
so
much
more
than
anyone
else
the
only
other
person
i
meant
to
write
to
in
the
same
style
is
father
knox
and
his
has
been
delayed
in
the
same
way
i
am
drowning
in
whirlpools
of
work
and
worry
over
the
which
nearly
went
bankrupt
for
good
this
week
but
worry
does
not
worry
so
much
as
it
did
before
unless
it
is
adding
insult
to
injury
i
shall
send
the
long
letter
after
all
this
i
send
off
instantly
on
receipt
of
yours
please
forgive
me
you
see
i
humiliate
myself
by
using
your
stamped
envelope
yours
always
chesterton
this
sense
that
the
church
was
needed
to
fight
for
the
world
was
very
strong
in
gilbert
when
he
hailed
it
to
his
mother
as
the
one
fighting
form
of
christianity
in
the
he
answered
near
this
time
a
newspaper
suggestion
that
the
church
ought
to
move
with
the
times
the
cities
of
the
plain
might
have
remarked
that
the
heavens
above
them
did
not
altogether
fit
in
with
their
own
high
civilisation
and
social
habits
they
would
be
right
oddly
enough
however
when
symmetry
was
eventually
restored
it
was
not
the
heavens
that
had
been
obliged
to
adapt
themselves
the
church
can
not
move
with
the
times
simply
because
the
times
are
not
moving
the
church
can
only
stick
in
the
mud
with
the
times
and
rot
and
stink
with
the
times
in
the
economic
and
social
world
as
such
there
is
no
activity
except
that
sort
of
automatic
activity
that
is
called
decay
the
withering
of
the
high
powers
of
freedom
and
their
decomposition
into
the
aboriginal
soil
of
slavery
in
that
way
the
world
stands
much
at
the
same
stage
as
it
did
at
the
beginning
of
the
dark
ages
and
the
church
has
the
same
task
as
it
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
dark
ages
to
save
all
the
light
and
liberty
that
can
be
saved
to
resist
the
downward
drag
of
the
world
and
to
wait
for
better
days
so
much
a
real
church
would
certainly
do
but
a
real
church
might
be
able
to
do
more
it
might
make
its
dark
ages
something
more
than
a
it
might
make
them
the
very
reverse
of
dark
it
might
present
its
more
human
ideal
in
such
abrupt
and
attractive
a
contrast
to
the
inhuman
trend
of
the
time
as
to
inspire
men
suddenly
for
one
of
the
moral
revolutions
of
history
so
that
men
now
living
shall
not
taste
of
death
until
they
have
seen
justice
return
we
do
not
want
as
the
newspapers
say
a
church
that
will
move
with
the
world
we
want
a
church
that
will
move
the
world
we
want
one
that
will
move
it
away
from
many
of
the
things
towards
which
it
is
now
moving
for
instance
the
servile
state
it
is
by
that
test
that
history
will
really
judge
of
any
church
whether
it
is
the
real
church
or
no
chapter
xxiv
completion
there
is
one
part
of
this
story
that
has
not
been
told
with
the
rest
our
lady
share
in
gilbert
conversion
the
chesterton
family
had
been
quite
without
the
strange
protestant
prejudice
that
in
the
minds
of
many
englishmen
sets
the
mother
of
god
against
god
the
son
our
lady
was
respected
though
of
course
not
invoked
in
a
boyhood
poem
gilbert
took
the
blasphemous
lines
of
swinburne
hymn
to
proserpine
and
wrote
a
kind
of
parody
in
reverse
turning
the
poem
into
a
hymn
to
mary
he
would
too
recite
swinburne
own
lines
deliberately
directing
them
away
from
swinburne
intention
and
supposing
them
addressed
to
the
new
christian
queen
of
life
rather
than
to
the
fallen
pagan
queen
of
death
but
i
turn
to
her
still
having
seen
she
shall
surely
abide
in
the
end
goddess
and
maiden
and
queen
be
near
me
now
and
befriend
nor
was
it
only
admiration
for
art
that
made
him
write
also
in
early
youth
the
nativity
of
botticelli
do
you
blame
me
that
i
sit
hours
before
this
picture
but
if
i
walked
all
over
the
world
in
this
time
i
should
hardly
see
anything
worth
seeing
that
is
not
in
this
picture
father
sees
in
catholic
church
and
a
hint
that
belloc
had
been
of
those
who
tried
to
hustle
gilbert
in
his
younger
days
but
on
this
profound
reality
of
mary
help
they
could
meet
many
years
before
gilbert
had
finished
the
slow
rumination
of
mind
and
the
painful
effort
of
will
that
had
held
him
so
long
here
is
an
early
letter
belloc
wrote
to
his
friend
reform
club
manchester
my
dear
gilbert
i
am
a
man
afraid
of
impulse
in
boats
horses
and
all
action
though
driven
to
it
i
have
never
written
a
letter
such
as
i
am
writing
now
though
i
have
desired
to
write
some
six
or
seven
since
i
became
a
grown
man
in
the
matter
we
discussed
at
oxford
i
have
a
word
to
say
which
is
easier
to
say
on
paper
than
by
word
of
mouth
or
rather
more
valuable
all
intellectual
process
is
doubtful
all
inconclusive
save
pure
deduction
which
is
a
game
if
one
first
certitudes
are
hypothetical
and
immensely
valuable
if
one
first
certitude
is
fixed
yet
remains
wholly
dependent
on
that
now
if
we
differed
in
all
main
points
i
would
not
write
thus
but
there
are
one
or
two
on
which
we
agree
one
is
vere
passus
immolatus
in
cruce
pro
homine
another
is
in
a
looking
up
to
our
dear
lady
the
blessed
mother
of
god
i
recommend
to
you
this
that
you
suggest
to
her
a
comprehension
for
yourself
of
what
indeed
is
the
permanent
home
of
the
soul
if
it
is
here
you
will
see
it
if
it
is
there
you
will
see
it
she
never
fails
us
she
has
never
failed
me
in
any
demand
i
have
never
written
thus
as
i
say
and
i
beg
you
to
see
nothing
in
it
but
what
i
say
there
is
no
connection
the
reason
can
seize
but
so
it
is
if
you
say
i
want
this
as
in
your
case
to
know
one
way
or
the
other
she
will
give
it
you
as
she
will
give
health
or
necessary
money
or
success
in
a
pure
love
she
is
our
blessed
mother
i
have
not
used
my
judgment
in
this
letter
i
am
inclined
to
destroy
it
but
i
shall
send
it
do
answer
it
yours
ever
belloc
at
top
of
letter
my
point
is
if
it
is
right
she
knows
if
it
is
not
right
she
knows
gilbert
believed
it
and
he
knew
that
as
he
came
to
the
church
he
was
coming
to
our
lady
now
i
can
scarcely
remember
a
time
when
the
image
of
our
lady
did
not
stand
up
in
my
mind
quite
definitely
at
the
mention
or
the
thought
of
all
these
things
i
was
quite
distant
from
these
things
and
then
doubtful
about
these
things
and
then
disputing
with
the
world
for
them
and
with
myself
against
them
for
that
is
the
condition
before
conversion
but
whether
the
figure
was
distant
or
was
dark
and
mysterious
or
was
a
scandal
to
my
contemporaries
or
was
a
challenge
to
myself
i
never
doubted
that
this
figure
was
the
figure
of
the
faith
that
she
embodied
as
a
complete
human
being
still
only
human
all
that
this
thing
had
to
say
to
humanity
the
instant
i
remembered
the
catholic
church
i
remembered
her
when
i
tried
to
forget
the
catholic
church
i
tried
to
forget
her
when
i
finally
saw
what
was
nobler
than
my
fate
the
freest
and
the
hardest
of
all
my
acts
of
freedom
it
was
in
front
of
a
gilded
and
very
gaudy
little
image
of
her
in
the
port
of
brindisi
that
i
promised
the
thing
that
i
would
do
if
i
returned
to
my
own
land
well
and
the
pp
in
his
quoted
with
considerable
amusement
a
learned
critic
who
said
it
was
possible
that
the
poet
had
passed
through
a
period
of
intense
devotion
more
especially
towards
the
virgin
mary
it
is
he
comments
it
does
occur
from
time
to
time
i
do
not
quite
understand
why
chaucer
must
have
through
this
fit
of
devotion
as
if
he
had
mariolatry
like
the
measles
even
an
amateur
who
has
encountered
this
malady
may
be
allowed
to
testify
that
it
does
not
usually
visit
its
victim
for
a
brief
it
is
generally
chronic
and
in
some
sad
cases
i
have
known
quite
incurable
p
queen
of
seven
is
the
great
expression
of
chronic
love
of
our
lady
and
men
looked
up
at
the
woman
made
for
the
morning
when
the
stars
were
young
for
whom
more
rude
than
a
beggar
rhyme
in
the
gutter
these
songs
were
sung
the
return
of
eve
exemplified
a
favourite
thought
of
his
when
the
journalist
keeps
repeating
that
the
life
of
religion
does
not
lie
in
dusty
dogmas
we
should
stop
him
with
a
great
shout
for
he
is
wrong
at
the
very
start
it
is
from
the
seed
of
dogma
and
from
that
seed
alone
that
all
the
powers
of
art
and
poetry
and
devotion
spring
in
the
days
of
his
boyhood
when
he
thought
of
our
lady
with
a
vague
and
confused
respect
as
madonna
he
could
not
have
written
the
return
of
eve
that
flower
came
from
the
seed
of
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
our
lady
is
the
mother
of
god
and
our
mother
this
doctrine
blossomed
as
he
wrote
i
found
one
hidden
in
every
home
a
voice
that
sings
about
the
house
a
nurse
that
scares
the
nightmares
off
a
mother
nearer
than
a
spouse
whose
picture
once
i
saw
and
there
wild
as
of
old
and
weird
and
sweet
in
sevenfold
splendour
blazed
the
moon
not
on
her
brow
beneath
her
feet
this
poem
the
white
witch
has
in
it
a
mingling
of
the
old
classical
stories
of
his
boyhood
and
the
new
light
of
christian
reality
in
everlasting
he
saw
the
myths
as
hunger
and
the
faith
as
bread
men
hearts
today
were
withered
because
they
had
forgotten
to
eat
their
bread
the
hunger
of
the
pagans
was
a
healthier
thing
than
the
jaded
sterility
of
the
modern
world
our
lady
was
ready
to
give
that
world
the
bread
of
life
once
more
and
as
he
meditated
on
the
mystery
of
the
virgin
birth
he
saw
god
making
purity
creative
she
alone
who
overcame
all
heresies
could
overcome
the
hideous
heresy
of
birth
prevention
that
christ
from
this
creative
purity
came
forth
your
sterile
appetites
to
scorn
so
in
her
house
life
without
lust
was
born
so
in
your
house
lust
without
life
shall
die
gaude
virgo
maria
cunctas
haereses
sola
interemisti
was
this
phrase
from
our
lady
office
ringing
in
gilbert
mind
as
he
sang
of
the
seven
champions
of
christendom
disarmed
and
worsted
in
the
fight
going
back
to
our
lady
to
find
that
she
had
hidden
their
swords
where
the
gospels
tell
us
she
hid
and
pondered
all
things
in
her
heart
from
her
wounded
heart
mary
takes
the
seven
swords
to
rearm
the
saints
who
have
to
reconquer
the
earth
certainly
he
must
often
have
thought
of
the
litany
so
many
verses
are
based
on
it
our
lord
as
a
baby
climbs
the
ivory
tower
of
his
mother
body
and
kisses
the
mystic
rose
of
her
lips
a
woman
was
his
walking
home
foederis
arca
ora
pro
nobis
and
he
thinks
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
as
trinkets
for
her
to
play
with
with
the
great
heart
a
woman
has
and
the
love
of
little
things
for
she
is
a
woman
regina
angelorum
queen
of
powers
and
archangels
she
yet
belongs
to
the
human
race
our
lady
went
into
a
strange
country
our
lady
for
she
was
ours
and
had
run
on
the
little
hills
behind
the
houses
and
pulled
small
flowers
but
she
rose
up
and
went
into
a
strange
country
with
strange
thrones
and
powers
from
a
welter
of
comment
and
correspondence
that
followed
his
conversion
challenging
scorning
rejoicing
welcoming
i
select
two
letters
from
the
two
closest
of
gilbert
catholic
friends
hilaire
belloc
and
maurice
baring
my
dear
gilbert
i
write
to
you
from
these
strange
surroundings
the
first
line
upon
the
news
you
gave
me
i
must
write
to
you
again
when
i
have
collected
myself
for
my
reactions
are
abominably
slow
i
have
however
something
to
say
immediately
and
that
is
why
i
write
this
very
evening
just
after
seeing
eleanor
off
at
the
station
the
thing
i
have
to
say
is
this
i
could
not
have
said
it
before
your
step
i
can
say
so
now
before
it
would
have
been
like
a
selected
pleading
the
catholic
church
is
the
exponent
of
reality
it
is
true
its
doctrines
in
matters
large
and
small
are
statements
of
what
is
this
it
is
which
the
ultimate
act
of
the
intelligence
accepts
this
it
is
which
the
will
deliberately
confirms
and
that
is
why
faith
though
an
act
of
the
will
is
moral
if
the
ordnance
map
tells
us
that
it
is
miles
to
a
place
then
my
mood
of
lassitude
as
i
walk
through
the
rain
at
night
making
it
feel
like
i
use
the
will
and
say
no
my
intelligence
has
been
convinced
and
i
compel
myself
to
use
it
against
my
mood
it
is
and
though
i
feel
in
the
depths
of
my
being
to
have
gone
miles
and
more
i
it
is
not
yet
i
have
gone
i
am
by
all
my
nature
of
mind
sceptical
and
as
to
the
doubt
of
the
soul
i
discover
it
to
be
false
a
mood
not
a
conclusion
my
conclusion
and
that
of
all
men
who
have
ever
once
seen
it
is
the
faith
corporate
organised
a
personality
teaching
a
thing
not
a
theory
it
to
you
who
have
the
blessing
of
profound
religious
emotion
this
statement
may
seem
too
desiccate
it
is
indeed
not
enthusiastic
it
lacks
meat
it
is
my
misfortune
in
youth
i
had
it
even
till
lately
grief
has
drawn
the
juices
from
it
i
am
alone
and
unfed
the
more
do
i
affirm
the
sanctity
the
unity
the
infallibility
of
the
catholic
church
by
my
very
isolation
do
i
the
more
affirm
it
as
a
man
in
a
desert
knows
that
water
is
right
for
man
or
as
a
wounded
dog
not
able
to
walk
yet
knows
the
way
home
the
catholic
church
is
the
natural
home
of
the
human
spirit
the
odd
perspective
picture
of
life
which
looks
like
a
meaningless
puzzle
at
first
seen
from
that
one
standpoint
takes
a
complete
order
and
meaning
like
the
skull
in
the
picture
of
the
ambassadors
so
much
for
my
jejune
contribution
not
without
value
because
i
know
you
regard
my
intelligence
a
perilous
tool
god
gave
me
for
his
own
purposes
one
bringing
nothing
to
me
but
beyond
this
there
will
come
in
time
if
i
save
my
soul
the
flesh
of
these
bones
which
bones
alone
i
can
describe
and
teach
i
know
without
feeling
an
odd
thing
in
such
a
connection
the
reality
of
beatitude
which
is
the
goal
of
catholic
living
in
hac
urbe

solennis

gaudia
yours
maurice
baring
wrote
august
my
dear
gilbert
when
i
wrote
to
you
the
other
day
i
was
still
cramped
by
the
possibility
of
the
news
not
being
true
although
i
it
was
true
i
felt
it
was
true
at
once
curiously
enough
i
felt
it
had
happened
before
i
saw
the
news
in
the
newspaper
at
all
i
felt
that
your
ship
had
arrived
at
its
port
but
the
more
i
felt
this
the
more
unwilling
i
was
to
say
anything
before
i
heard
the
news
from
a
source
other
than
the
newspapers
i
gave
way
to
an
excess
a
foolish
excess
perhaps
of
scruple
but
you
will
i
think
understand
this
in
writing
to
you
the
other
day
i
expressed
not
a
tenth
part
of
what
i
felt
and
feel
and
that
baldly
and
inadequately
nothing
for
years
has
given
me
so
much
joy
i
have
hardly
ever
entered
a
church
without
putting
up
a
candle
to
our
lady
or
to
joseph
or
anthony
for
you
and
both
this
year
and
last
year
in
lent
i
made
a
novena
for
you
i
know
of
many
other
people
better
people
far
than
i
who
did
the
same
many
masses
were
said
for
you
and
prayers
all
over
england
and
scotland
in
centres
of
holiness
i
will
show
you
some
day
a
letter
from
some
nuns
on
the
subject
a
great
friend
of
mine
one
of
the
greatest
saints
i
have
known
sister
mary
annunciation
of
the
convent
orphanage
upper
norwood
used
always
to
pray
for
you
she
alas
died
last
year
did
i
ever
quote
you
a
sentence
of
bernard
holland
on
the
subject
of
kenelm
henry
digby
when
the
latter
was
received
father
scott
who
at
last
guided
him
through
the
narrow
door
where
one
must
bend
one
head
into
the
internal
space
and
freedom
of
the
eternal
and
universal
catholic
church
and
that
was
what
i
experienced
on
being
received
that
is
what
i
have
been
most
conscious
of
ever
since
it
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
the
ordinary
protestant
conceives
to
be
the
case
to
him
and
not
only
to
him
but
to
the
ordinary
english
agnostic
the
convert
to
catholicism
is
abandoning
his
will
and
his
independence
sometimes
they
think
even
his
nationality
at
the
best
they
think
he
is
sheltering
himself
in
a
walled
garden
at
the
worst
they
think
he
has
closed
on
himself
an
iron
door
and
shackled
himself
with
foolish
chains
and
sold
his
birthright
for
a
crown
of
tinsel
and
yet
their
own
experience
the
testimony
of
their
eyes
if
they
would
only
use
them
ought
to
suggest
to
them
that
they
might
perhaps
be
mistaken
it
would
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
make
out
a
case
for
the
unenglishness
of
manning
or
indeed
of
any
prominent
english
catholic
whether
a
born
catholic
or
a
convert
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
prove
that
belloc
was
a
writer
wanting
in
independence
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
convince
any
one
that
father
vaughan
and
lord
fitzalan
were
wearing
foolscaps
and
anybody
who
has
thought
about
history
or
looked
on
at
politics
must
have
reflected
that
freedom
resides
where
there
is
order
and
not
where
there
is
license
or
it
is
true
in
politics
it
is
true
in
art
it
is
the
basis
of
our
whole
social
life
in
england
russia
has
just
given
us
the
most
startling
of
object
lessons
the
english
with
their
passion
for
committees
their
and
their
well
organised
traffic
are
daily
realising
the
fact
however
little
they
may
recognise
the
theory
only
the
law
can
give
us
freedom
said
goethe
talking
of
art
und
das
gesetz
kann
nur
die
freiheit
geben
well
all
i
have
to
say
gilbert
is
what
i
think
i
have
already
said
to
you
and
what
i
have
said
not
long
ago
in
a
printed
book
that
i
was
received
into
the
church
on
the
eve
of
candlemass
and
it
is
perhaps
the
only
act
in
my
life
which
i
am
quite
certain
i
have
never
regretted
every
day
i
live
the
church
seems
to
me
more
and
more
wonderful
the
sacraments
more
and
more
solemn
and
sustaining
the
voice
of
the
church
her
liturgy
her
rules
her
discipline
her
ritual
her
decisions
in
matters
of
faith
and
morals
more
and
more
excellent
and
profoundly
wise
and
true
and
right
and
her
children
stamped
with
something
that
those
outside
her
are
without
there
i
have
found
truth
and
reality
and
everything
outside
her
is
to
me
compared
with
her
as
dust
and
shadow
once
more
god
bless
you
and
frances
please
give
her
my
love
in
my
prayers
for
you
i
have
always
added
her
name
yours
maurice
it
was
a
bit
of
great
good
fortune
although
at
the
time
he
did
not
feel
it
so
that
the
death
of
the
in
for
lack
of
funds
left
gilbert
some
months
for
uninterrupted
creative
thought
before
took
its
place
lawrence
solomon
friend
of
his
boyhood
and
at
this
time
a
near
neighbour
has
told
me
not
only
how
happy
his
conversion
had
made
gilbert
but
also
how
it
had
seemed
to
bring
him
increased
strength
of
character
worry
he
had
told
maurice
baring
did
not
worry
so
much
as
of
old
because
of
a
fundamental
peace
in
this
atmosphere
were
written
two
of
his
most
important
books
francis
of
published
everlasting
published
in
a
poem
he
has
expressed
his
sense
of
conversion
as
a
new
light
that
had
transfigured
life
indeed
of
a
new
life
given
to
him
after
one
moment
when
i
bowed
my
head
and
the
whole
world
turned
over
and
came
upright
and
i
came
out
where
the
old
road
shone
white
i
walked
the
ways
and
heard
what
all
men
said
they
rattle
reason
out
through
many
a
sieve
that
stores
the
sand
and
lets
the
gold
go
free
and
all
these
things
are
less
than
dust
to
me
because
my
name
is
lazarus
and
i
live
the
convert
both
books
shine
with
that
light
on
the
white
road
of
endeavour
thrill
with
that
life
gilbert
felt
now
the
clue
to
history
in
his
fingers
and
he
used
it
increasingly
everlasting
is
the
of
his
later
life
and
one
difficulty
in
dealing
with
it
adequately
was
expressed
in
a
letter
from
william
lyon
phelps
thanking
the
author
for
a
magnificent
work
of
genius
and
never
more
needed
than
now
i
took
out
my
pencil
to
mark
the
most
important
passages
but
i
quickly
put
my
pencil
in
my
pocket
for
i
found
i
had
to
mark
every
sentence
reading
the
book
for
perhaps
the
seventh
time
i
can
only
say
i
hope
without
irreverence
what
himself
says
happens
to
those
who
can
read
the
words
of
the
gospels
simply
enough
they
will
feel
as
if
rocks
had
been
rolled
upon
them
criticism
is
only
words
about
words
and
of
what
use
are
words
about
such
words
as
these
rocks
rolled
upon
them
did
he
not
feel
crushed
overwhelmed
at
times
by
his
own
thought
on
these
immensities
or
can
the
philosopher
carry
his
thoughts
as
lightly
as
gilbert
so
often
seemed
to
carry
his
i
think
not
always
he
must
have
needed
superhuman
strength
to
conceive
and
give
birth
to
this
mighty
book
the
thoughts
sketched
in
new
had
grown
to
their
full
fruition
in
an
atmosphere
of
meditation
it
would
be
much
easier
to
give
an
outline
of
everlasting
than
of
much
harder
to
give
an
idea
of
it
for
consists
of
a
hundred
brilliant
arguments
while
everlasting
really
is
a
vision
of
history
supported
by
a
historical
outline
comparing
his
own
effort
with
that
of
wells
chesterton
says
i
do
not
believe
that
the
best
way
to
produce
an
outline
of
history
is
to
rub
out
the
lines
he
is
like
wells
however
in
not
being
a
specialist
but
claiming
the
right
of
the
amateur
to
do
his
best
with
the
facts
the
specialists
provide
only
their
specialists
are
different
specialists
and
their
facts
therefore
largely
different
facts
chesterton
unlike
most
converts
wrote
concerning
his
own
conversion
the
least
interesting
of
his
later
books
but
in
everlasting
he
is
not
at
all
concerned
with
his
own
spiritual
wayfaring
he
merely
wants
to
make
everyone
else
look
at
what
he
has
come
to
see
at
the
end
of
the
way
the
book
is
an
attempt
to
get
outside
man
and
thus
see
him
as
the
strange
being
he
really
is
to
get
outside
christianity
and
see
for
the
first
time
its
uniqueness
among
the
religions
of
the
world
why
are
not
all
men
aware
of
the
uniqueness
of
man
among
the
animals
and
the
uniqueness
of
the
church
among
religions
because
they
do
not
really
look
at
either
familiarity
has
dulled
the
edge
of
awareness
men
must
be
made
to
see
them
as
though
for
the
first
time
and
it
is
the
towering
achievement
of
this
book
that
reading
it
we
do
so
see
them
i
desire
to
help
the
reader
to
see
christendom
from
the
outside
in
the
sense
of
seeing
it
as
a
whole
against
the
background
of
other
historic
things
just
as
i
desire
him
to
see
humanity
as
a
whole
against
the
background
of
natural
things
and
i
say
that
in
both
cases
when
seen
thus
they
stand
out
from
their
background
like
supernatural
things
this
being
his
desire
he
divides
the
book
into
two
parts
the
first
being
the
main
adventure
of
the
human
race
in
so
far
as
it
remained
heathen
and
the
second
a
summary
of
the
real
difference
that
was
made
by
it
becoming
christian
notable
as
the
first
part
is
it
is
only
a
preparation
for
the
second
which
shows
the
church
not
as
one
religion
among
many
but
as
the
only
religion
for
it
is
the
only
thing
that
binds
into
one
both
philosophy
or
thought
and
mythology
or
poetry
giving
us
a
logos
who
is
also
the
hero
of
the
strangest
story
in
the
world
he
asks
the
man
who
talks
of
reading
the
gospels
really
to
read
them
as
he
might
read
his
daily
paper
and
to
feel
the
terrific
shock
of
the
words
of
christ
to
the
pharisees
or
the
behaviour
of
christ
to
the
to
look
at
the
uniqueness
of
the
church
that
has
died
so
often
but
like
her
founder
risen
again
from
the
dead
two
untrue
things
he
felt
were
constantly
reiterated
about
the
gospel
one
that
the
church
had
overlaid
and
made
difficult
a
plain
and
simple
story
the
other
that
the
hero
of
this
story
was
merely
human
and
taught
a
morality
suitable
to
his
own
age
inapplicable
in
our
more
complicated
society
to
anyone
who
really
read
the
gospels
the
instant
impression
would
be
rather
that
they
were
full
of
dark
riddles
which
only
historic
christianity
has
clarified
the
eunuchs
of
the
heavenly
kingdom
would
be
an
idea
dark
and
terrible
but
for
the
historic
beauty
of
catholic
virginity
the
ideal
of
man
and
woman
in
one
flesh
inseparable
and
sanctified
by
a
sacrament
became
clear
in
the
lives
of
the
great
married
saints
of
christendom
the
apparent
idealisation
of
idleness
above
service
in
the
story
of
mary
and
martha
was
lit
up
by
the
sight
of
catherine
and
clare
and
teresa
shining
above
the
little
home
at
bethany
the
meek
inheriting
the
earth
became
the
basis
of
a
new
social
order
when
the
mystical
monks
reclaimed
the
lands
that
the
practical
kings
had
lost
thus
if
the
gospel
was
a
riddle
the
church
was
the
answer
to
the
riddle
because
both
were
created
by
one
who
knew
who
saw
the
ages
in
which
his
own
creation
was
to
find
completion
whose
morality
was
not
one
of
another
age
but
of
another
world
chesterton
gathered
history
in
his
mind
and
saw
together
before
the
christmas
crib
the
shepherds
who
had
found
their
shepherd
the
philosopher
kings
who
would
stand
for
the
same
human
ideal
if
their
names
had
really
been
confucius
or
pythagoras
or
plato
they
were
those
who
sought
not
tales
but
the
truth
of
things
and
since
their
thirst
for
truth
was
itself
a
thirst
for
god
they
also
have
had
their
reward
but
even
in
order
to
understand
that
reward
we
must
understand
that
for
philosophy
as
much
as
mythology
that
reward
was
the
completion
of
the
incomplete
everlasting
p
too
had
needed
the
completion
of
incomplete
human
thought
he
too
had
followed
the
star
from
a
far
country
it
had
been
a
fancy
of
his
boyhood
caught
from
a
fairytale
that
evil
lurked
somewhere
in
a
hidden
room
of
the
human
house
and
the
human
heart
he
saw
in
the
history
of
the
ancients
a
consciousness
of
the
fall
in
the
sadness
of
their
songs
a
sense
of
the
presence
of
the
absence
of
god
but
at
bethlehem
he
saw
the
transformation
that
had
come
upon
the
whole
race
of
man
with
that
little
local
infancy
concealing
the
mighty
power
of
god
who
had
put
himself
under
the
feet
of
the
world
it
is
rather
as
if
a
man
had
found
an
inner
room
in
the
very
heart
of
his
own
house
which
he
had
never
suspected
and
seen
a
light
from
within
it
is
as
if
he
found
something
at
the
back
of
his
own
heart
that
betrayed
him
into
good
it
is
not
made
of
what
the
world
would
call
strong
materials
or
rather
it
is
made
of
materials
whose
strength
is
in
that
winged
levity
with
which
they
brush
us
and
pass
it
is
all
that
is
in
us
but
a
brief
tenderness
that
is
there
made
eternal
all
that
means
no
more
than
a
momentary
softening
that
is
in
some
strange
fashion
become
a
strengthening
and
a
repose
it
is
the
broken
speech
and
the
lost
word
that
are
made
positive
and
suspended
unbroken
as
the
strange
kings
fade
into
a
far
country
and
the
mountains
resound
no
more
with
the
feet
of
the
shepherds
and
only
the
night
and
the
cavern
lie
in
fold
upon
fold
over
something
more
human
than
humanity
p
it
seems
to
me
profoundly
significant
that
gilbert
studied
first
in
the
little
poor
man
of
assisi
what
christ
could
do
in
one
man
before
he
came
on
to
the
study
of
what
he
had
done
in
mankind
as
a
whole
of
who
he
was
who
had
done
it
for
the
man
thus
chosen
embodied
the
ideals
that
gilbert
had
seen
dimly
in
his
boyhood
ideals
that
most
of
us
accept
a
little
reluctantly
from
the
church
but
which
had
actually
attracted
him
towards
the
church
francis
had
found
the
secret
of
life
in
being
the
servant
and
the
secondary
figure
he
seems
to
have
liked
everybody
but
especially
those
whom
everybody
disliked
him
for
liking
by
nature
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
has
that
vanity
which
is
the
opposite
of
pride
that
vanity
which
is
very
near
to
humility
he
never
despised
his
fellow
creatures
and
therefore
he
never
despised
the
opinion
of
his
fellow
creatures
including
the
admiration
of
his
fellow
creatures
he
was
above
all
things
a
great
giver
and
he
cared
chiefly
for
the
best
kind
of
giving
which
is
called
thanksgiving
if
another
great
man
wrote
a
grammar
of
assent
he
may
well
be
said
to
have
written
a
grammar
of
acceptance
a
grammar
of
gratitude
he
understood
down
to
its
very
depths
the
theory
of
thanks
and
its
depths
are
a
bottomless
abyss
here
in
francis
gilbert
saw
the
apotheosis
of
his
old
boyish
thought
that
thanksgiving
is
a
duty
and
a
joy
that
we
should
love
not
humanity
but
each
human
things
shadowed
in
the
notebook
are
in
for
the
transition
from
the
good
man
to
the
saint
is
a
sort
of
revolution
by
which
one
for
whom
all
things
illustrate
and
illuminate
god
becomes
one
for
whom
god
illustrates
and
illuminates
all
things
it
is
rather
like
the
reversal
whereby
a
lover
might
say
at
first
sight
that
a
lady
looked
like
a
flower
and
say
afterwards
that
all
flowers
reminded
him
of
his
lady
a
saint
and
a
poet
standing
by
the
same
flower
might
seem
to
say
the
same
thing
but
indeed
though
they
would
both
be
telling
the
truth
they
would
be
telling
different
truths
for
one
the
joy
of
life
is
a
cause
of
faith
for
the
other
rather
a
result
of
faith
francis
of
p
everlasting
and
the
seem
to
me
the
highest
expression
of
gilbert
mysticism
i
have
hesitated
to
use
the
word
for
it
is
not
one
to
be
used
lightly
but
i
can
find
no
other
like
most
catholics
i
have
been
wont
to
believe
that
to
be
a
mystic
a
man
must
first
be
an
ascetic
and
gilbert
was
not
an
ascetic
in
the
ordinary
sense
but
is
there
not
for
the
thinker
an
asceticism
of
the
mind
very
searching
very
purifying
in
his
youth
he
had
told
bentley
that
creative
writing
was
the
hardest
of
hard
labour
that
sense
of
the
pressure
of
thought
that
made
newman
call
creative
writing
getting
rid
of
pain
by
pain
the
profound
depression
that
often
follows
the
exhaustion
that
seems
like
a
bottomless
pit
theresa
said
the
hardest
penance
was
easier
than
mental
prayer
was
not
much
of
gilbert
thought
a
contemplation
faith
thanksgiving
love
surely
these
far
above
bodily
asceticism
can
so
clear
a
man
eyesight
that
he
may
fittingly
be
called
a
mystic
since
he
sees
god
everywhere
the
less
a
man
thinks
of
himself
the
more
he
thinks
of
his
good
luck
and
of
all
the
gifts
of
god
only
a
poet
who
was
more
than
a
poet
could
see
so
clearly
of
what
like
francis
was
when
we
say
that
a
poet
praises
the
whole
creation
we
commonly
mean
only
that
he
praises
the
whole
cosmos
but
this
sort
of
poet
does
really
praise
creation
in
the
sense
of
the
act
of
creation
he
praises
the
passage
or
transition
from
nonentity
to
entity
there
falls
here
also
the
shadow
of
that
archetypal
image
of
the
bridge
which
has
given
to
the
priest
his
archaic
and
mysterious
name
the
mystic
who
passes
through
the
moment
when
there
is
nothing
but
god
does
in
some
sense
behold
the
beginningless
beginnings
in
which
there
was
really
nothing
else
he
not
only
appreciates
everything
but
the
nothing
of
which
everything
was
made
in
a
fashion
he
endures
and
answers
even
the
earthquake
irony
of
the
book
of
job
in
some
sense
he
is
there
when
the
foundations
of
the
world
are
laid
with
the
mornings
stars
singing
together
and
the
sons
of
god
shouting
for
joy
francis
of
pp
but
there
was
in
all
those
years
another
element
besides
the
giving
of
thanks
and
the
joy
of
creation
an
abiding
grief
for
the
sorrows
of
the
sons
of
men
and
especially
those
of
his
own
land
in
this
mood
the
was
written
nine
years
separate
the
publication
of
from
that
of
the
of
written
at
the
time
when
englishmen
were
fighting
so
magnificently
that
book
had
radiated
own
mood
of
hope
but
to
read
to
meditate
on
cobbett
england
and
then
turn
to
the
england
of
the
hour
was
not
cheerful
for
cobbett
did
not
draw
precise
diagrams
of
things
as
they
were
he
only
had
frantic
and
fantastic
nightmares
of
things
as
they
are
and
these
nightmares
haunted
cobbett
biographer
p
what
he
saw
was
not
an
eden
that
can
not
exist
but
rather
an
inferno
that
can
exist
and
even
that
does
exist
what
he
saw
was
the
perishing
of
the
whole
english
power
of
the
growth
of
cities
that
drain
and
dry
up
the
countryside
the
growth
of
dense
dependent
populations
incapable
of
finding
their
own
food
the
toppling
triumph
of
machines
over
men
the
sprawling
omnipotence
of
financiers
over
patriots
the
herding
of
humanity
in
nomadic
masses
whose
very
homes
are
homeless
the
terrible
necessity
of
peace
and
the
terrible
probability
of
war
all
the
loading
up
of
our
little
island
like
a
sinking
ship
the
wealth
that
may
mean
famine
and
the
culture
that
may
mean
despair
the
bread
of
midas
and
the
sword
of
damocles
in
a
word
he
saw
what
we
see
but
he
saw
it
when
it
was
not
there
and
some
can
not
see
it
even
when
it
is
there
pp
two
men
had
written
of
the
reformation
as
the
ultimate
origin
of
these
evils
at
a
time
when
it
was
still
the
fashion
to
treat
it
as
the
dawn
of
all
good
lingard
himself
a
catholic
had
written
cautiously
with
careful
documentation
and
moderate
tone
cobbett
a
protestant
had
written
hastily
and
furiously
but
both
men
had
drawn
in
essentials
the
same
picture
chesterton
suspected
that
cobbett
was
treated
with
contempt
lingard
with
respect
largely
because
of
the
difference
in
the
tone
of
the
two
men
lingard
spoke
restrainedly
but
cobbett
voice
was
raised
in
a
loud
cry
he
was
simply
a
man
who
had
discovered
a
crime
ancient
like
many
crimes
concealed
like
all
crimes
he
was
as
one
who
had
found
in
a
dark
wood
the
bones
of
his
mother
and
suddenly
knew
she
had
been
murdered
he
knew
now
that
england
had
been
secretly
slain
some
he
would
say
might
think
it
a
matter
of
mild
regret
to
be
expressed
in
murmurs
but
when
he
found
a
corpse
he
gave
a
shout
and
if
fools
laughed
at
anyone
shouting
he
would
shout
the
more
till
the
world
should
be
shaken
with
that
terrible
cry
in
the
night
it
is
that
ringing
and
arresting
cry
of
murder
wrung
from
him
as
he
stumbled
over
those
bones
of
the
dead
england
that
distinguishes
him
from
all
his
contemporaries
pp
yet
for
the
christian
hope
remains
no
murder
can
be
the
end
christianity
has
died
many
times
and
risen
again
for
it
had
a
god
who
knew
the
way
out
of
the
grave
this
quotation
is
from
the
chapter
called
five
deaths
of
the
faith
in
everlasting
several
times
in
the
book
chesterton
puts
aside
tempting
lines
of
thought
with
the
remark
that
he
intends
to
develop
them
later
in
one
of
the
unwritten
books
that
he
always
felt
were
so
much
better
than
those
he
actually
wrote
would
any
human
life
have
been
long
enough
to
develop
them
all
anyhow
even
the
whole
of
this
life
was
not
available
as
i
turn
to
the
story
of
the
weekly
paper
rising
again
from
its
ashes
i
ask
myself
the
question
i
have
often
asked
was
it
worth
while
i
can
not
answer
the
question
something
of
his
manhood
seemed
to
gilbert
bound
up
with
this
struggle
and
it
may
be
he
would
have
been
a
lesser
man
had
he
abandoned
it
and
yet
at
moments
imagining
the
poetry
the
philosophy
that
might
have
been
ours
another
another
i
am
tempted
to
wish
that
these
years
had
not
thus
been
sacrificed
to
the
paper
which
enshrined
his
brother
memory

reluctant

you

that

higher
ballad
of
the
white
could
gilbert
have
divided
his
life
between
literary
work
his
home
at
top
meadow
and
those
other
elements
called
in
the
friendship
and
foolery
that
life
might
well
have
been
as
he
himself
called
it
indefensibly
fortunate
and
happy
but
he
could
not
part
of
his
philosophy
of
joy
was
that
thanks
must
be
given
for
sunsets
for
dandelions
for
beech
trees
for
home
and
friends
and
this
thanks
could
only
be
the
taking
of
his
part
in
the
fight
he
would
never
he
once
said
have
turned
of
his
own
accord
to
politics
it
is
arguable
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
never
had
but
his
brother
had
plunged
into
the
fray
with
that
very
political
paper
the
and
his
brother
death
had
left
it
in
hands
he
felt
the
task
to
be
a
sacred
legacy
and
when
the
paper
died
for
lack
of
funds
his
one
thought
was
how
to
start
it
again
for
many
months
he
kept
the
office
in
being
and
paid
salaries
to
a
skeleton
staff
consisting
of
gander
the
deaf
old
manager
miss
dunham
now
phillips
and
an
office
boy
titterton
would
stroll
in
and
play
cricket
with
the
office
boy
with
a
paper
ball
and
a
endless
discussions
were
held
as
to
how
to
the
paper
and
whether
under
the
old
name

a
new

or
so
which
always
is
do
open
with
an
article
to
say
that
your
paper
supplies
a
want
do
blight
your
columns
with
do
bewilder
your
readers
with
the
family
jokes
of
your
clique
else
there
will
be
no
second
number
ponder
this
it
is
sound
your
main
difficulty
is
that
the
class
whose
champion
you
have
made
yourself
reads
either
lloyd
or
nothing
to
the
rural
proprietor
no
longer
a
peasant
art
including
is
immorality
and
people
who
idealize
peasants
unpractical
fools
also
the
roman
catholic
church
embarrassed
by
recruits
of
your
type
and
born
scoffers
like
belloc
who
cling
to
the
church
because
its
desecration
would
take
all
the
salt
out
of
blasphemy
will
quietly
put
you
on
the
unofficial
index
the
irish
will
not
support
an
english
journal
because
it
occasionally
waves
a
green
flag
far
better
than
they
can
wave
it
themselves
and
the
number
of
jews
who
will
buy
you
just
to
see
what
you
say
about
them
is
not
large
enough
to
keep
you
going
thus
there
is
absolutely
no
public
for
your
policy
and
though
there
is
a
select
one
for
yourself
one
and
indivisible
it
is
largely
composed
of
people
to
whom
your
oddly
assorted
antipathies
and
feuds
are
uncongenial
besides
on
these
fancies
of
yours
you
have
by
this
time
said
all
you
have
to
say
so
many
thousand
times
over
that
your
most
faithful
admirers
finally
and
always
suddenly
discover
they
are
fed
up
with
the
and
can
not
go
on
with
it
this
last
danger
becomes
greater
as
you
become
older
because
when
we
are
young
we
can
tell
ourselves
a
new
story
every
night
between
our
prayers
and
our
sleep
but
later
on
we
find
ourselves
repeating
the
same
story
with
intensifications
and
improvements
night
after
night
until
we
are
tired
of
it
and
in
the
end
which
you
have
not
yet
reached
a
story
revived
from
the
old
repertory
has
to
last
for
months
and
is
more
and
more
shaky
as
a
protection
against
thinking
of
business
or
lying
there
a
prey
to
unwelcome
reminiscences
and
what
happens
to
the
story
of
the
imaginative
child
happens
also
to
the
sermon
or
the
feuilleton
of
the
adult
it
is
inevitably
happening
to
you
that
is
the
case
against
the
success
of
chesterton
your
only
chance
finally
is
either
to
broaden
your
basis
or
to
have
no
basis
at
all
like
dickens
in
household
words
and
all
the
year
round
and
say
give
me
something
with
imagination
in
it
and
i
can
do
without
politics
or
theoretic
sociology
of
any
kind
this
is
perhaps
the
only
true
catholicism
in
literature
but
it
will
hardly
serve
your
turn
because
all
the
articles
and
stories
that
dickens
got
are
now
mopped
up
by
the
popular
press
which
in
his
day
stuck
to
politics
and
news
and
nothing
else
so
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
stand
for
a
policy
or
at
least
a
recognisable
attitude
unless
you
are
prepared
to
write
a
detective
story
every
week
and
make
belloc
write
a
satirical
story
as
well
you
could
broaden
your
basis
if
you
had
money
enough
to
try
the
experiment
of
giving
ten
poor
but
honest
men
in
beaconsfield
and
ten
more
in
london
capital
enough
to
start
for
themselves
as
independent
farmers
and
shopkeepers
the
result
would
be
to
ruin
out
of
the
twenty
and
possibly
to
ruin
the
lot
you
would
then
learn
from
your
feelings
what
you
would
never
learn
from
me
that
what
men
need
is
not
property
but
honorable
service
confronted
either
with
men
ruined
by
your
act
or
ruined
and
one
fascination
fledgby
owning
half
a
street
in
london
and
the
other
half
a
parish
in
bucks
you
would
well
perhaps
join
the
fabian
society
the
pseudo
race
feuds
you
should
drop
simply
because
you
can
not
compete
with
the
which
gives
the
real
thing
in
its
succulent
savagery
whilst
you
can
give
only
a
would
hurt
a
fly
affectation
of
it
in
religion
too
you
are
up
against
the
fact
that
an
editor
like
an
emperor
must
not
belong
to
a
sect
wells
is
on
the
right
tack
my
tack
see
my
prefaces
to
androcles
and
methuselah
we
want
the
real
catholic
church
above
the
manufactured
one
the
manufactured
one
is
useful
as
the
salvation
army
is
useful
or
the
formulas
of
the
church
of
christ
scientist
but
they
do
not
strike
on
the
knowledge
box
of
the
modern
intellectual
and
it
is
on
the
modern
intellectual
that
you
are
depending
i
am
an
irishman
and
know
how
far
the
official
catholic
church
can
go
your
ideal
church
does
not
exist
and
never
can
exist
within
the
official
organization
in
which
father
dempsey
will
always
be
efficient
and
father
keegan
futile
if
not
actually
silenced
and
i
know
that
an
officially
catholic
chesterton
is
an
impossibility
however
you
must
find
out
all
this
for
yourself
as
i
found
it
out
for
myself
mere
controversy
is
waste
of
time
and
faith
is
a
curious
thing
i
believe
that
you
would
not
have
become
a
professed
official
catholic
if
you
did
not
believe
that
you
believe
in
transubstantiation
but
i
find
it
quite
impossible
to
believe
that
you
believe
in
transubstantiation
any
more
than
say
saleeby
does
you
will
have
to
go
to
confession
next
easter
and
i
find
the
spectacle
the
box
your
portly
kneeling
figure
the
poor
devil
inside
wishing
you
had
become
a
fireworshipper
instead
of
coming
there
to
shake
his
soul
with
a
sense
of
his
ridiculousness
and
yours
all
incredible
monstrous
comic
though
of
course
i
can
put
a
perfect
literary
complexion
on
it
in
a
brace
of
shakes
now
however
i
am
becoming
personal
how
else
can
i
be
sincere
besides
i
am
going
on
too
long
and
the
lunch
bell
is
ringing
so
forgive
me
and
do
bother
to
answer
unless
you
can
not
help
it
ever
bernard
shaw
meanwhile
shaw
as
usual
responded
cordially
to
gilbert
wish
to
make
him
an
early
attraction
in
the
paper
but
also
as
usual
urged
him
towards
the
theatre
by
all
means
send
me
a
screed
about
joan
of
arc
for
the
cockpit
but
i
protest
i
have
no
views
about
her
i
am
only
the
first
man
modest
enough
to
know
his
place
as
a
simple
reporter
and
old
stage
hand
you
should
write
plays
instead
of
editing
papers
why
not
do
george
fox
who
was
released
from
the
prisons
in
which
protestant
england
was
doing
its
best
to
murder
him
by
the
catholic
charles
ii
george
and
joan
were
as
like
as
two
peas
in
pluck
and
obstinacy
the
specimen
advance
number
was
published
before
the
end
of
in
the
leading
article
gave
his
reasons
for
agreeing
finally
to
use
his
own
name
although
in
the
form
attacked
by
shaw
he
had
first
viewed
the
proposal
with
a
horror
which
has
since
softened
into
loathing
he
had
looked
for
a
title
that
should
indicate
the
policy
but
while
that
policy
was
in
fact
a
support
of
human
normality
property
freedom
and
the
family
yet
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
so
abnormal
that
any
title
defining
our
doctrine
makes
it
look
doctrinaire
a
name
like
distributive
would
suggest
that
a
distributist
was
like
a
socialist
a
crank
or
a
pedant
with
a
new
theory
of
human
nature
it
is
so
old
that
it
has
become
new
at
the
same
time
i
want
a
title
that
does
suggest
that
the
paper
is
controversial
and
that
this
is
the
general
trend
of
its
controversy
i
want
something
that
will
be
recognised
as
a
flag
however
fantastic
and
ridiculous
that
will
be
in
some
sense
a
challenge
even
if
the
challenge
be
received
only
with
genial
derision
i
do
not
want
a
colourless
name
and
the
nearest
i
can
get
to
something
like
a
symbol
is
merely
to
fly
my
own
colours
although
the
paper
was
never
exclusively
catholic
that
flag
was
for
as
it
had
been
for
cecil
of
a
very
definite
pattern
and
very
clear
colours
religiously
the
paper
stood
for
catholic
christianity
socially
for
the
theory
of
small
ownership
personal
responsibility
and
property
it
was
in
strong
opposition
especially
to
socialism
and
even
more
to
communism
bernard
shaw
gilbert
once
said
wanted
to
distribute
money
among
the
poor
we
want
to
distribute
power
during
the
last
part
of
cecil
editorship
his
wife
had
been
assistant
editor
of
the
and
she
had
so
continued
when
gilbert
first
became
editor
but
she
was
neither
a
catholic
nor
a
distributist
religion
seems
not
to
have
interested
her
and
her
political
outlook
was
entirely
different
from
gilbert
in
she
dismissed
distributism
as
quite
without
first
principles
and
a
pious
hope
and
no
more
obviously
it
was
impossible
for
gilbert
to
start
his
new
paper
with
an
assistant
editor
in
entire
disagreement
with
his
views
i
have
sometimes
wondered
whether
his
intense
dislike
of
having
to
tell
cecil
this
was
not
almost
as
strong
a
factor
in
the
delay
as
the
money
problem
i
have
learnt
as
this
book
goes
to
press
that
cecil
became
a
catholic
in
there
was
no
break
in
their
relations
she
went
on
writing
for
the
paper
doing
chiefly
the
dramatic
criticism
but
it
is
clear
from
her
own
account
of
the
incident
that
she
wholly
misconstrued
attitude
and
did
not
realise
how
far
she
herself
had
drifted
from
cecil
views
as
well
as
from
gilbert
shaw
wrote
again
reid
palace
hotel
funchal
madeira
january
my
dear
the
sample
number
has
followed
me
out
here
what
a
treasure
considering
that
i
had
cecil
own
assurance
that
my
quintessence
of
ibsenism
rescued
him
from
rationalism
and
that
it
was
written
in
i
abandoned
rationalism
consciously
and
explicitly
in
i
consider
john
prothero
introduction
of
me
to
your
readers
as
a
recently
converted
materialist
rationalist
to
be
a
most
unnatural
act
and
it
would
serve
her
right
if
i
never
spoke
to
her
again
rationalism
is
the
bane
of
the
church
a
roman
priest
always
wants
to
argue
with
you
a
church
of
england
parson
flies
in
terror
from
an
argument
a
fundamentally
sensible
course
george
fox
simply
knocked
arguers
out
with
his
i
have
experimental
knowledge
of
god
thomas
aquinas
was
like
me
he
knew
the
worthlessness
of
ratiocination
because
he
could
do
it
so
well
and
yet
despaired
of
the
inspirationists
in
practical
life
because
they
did
it
so
badly
does
know
her
way
about
in
this
controversy
and
i
can
not
take
up
her
challenge
what
makes
me
uneasy
about
the
prospectus
is
that
you
drag
in
you
might
as
well
have
declared
for
brighter
london
at
once
or
said
that
the
paper
would
be
printed
at
the
office
of
the
you
run
the
risk
of
the
money
coming
from
the
trade
however
only
remember
the
fate
of
all
the
editors
gardiner
donald
massingham
who
have
written
without
regard
to
their
proprietors
the
strength
of
your
position
is
that
they
can
hardly
carry
on
with
your
name
in
the
title
without
you
but
they
can
kill
the
paper
by
stopping
supplies
if
it
does
not
pay
and
the
chances
are
that
it
will
not
i
have
never
had
a
farthing
of
interest
on
my
shares
in
the
new
statesman
and
expect
i
ever
shall
therefore
keep
your
list
of
shareholders
as
various
and
as
uncommercial
as
you
can
get
catholic
money
rather
than
beer
money
as
i
am
the
real
patentee
of
the
distributive
state
and
the
is
socialism
and
as
furthermore
the
church
must
remain
at
least
neutral
on
prohibition
as
in
the
united
states
where
a
catholic
priest
has
just
set
a
praiseworthy
example
of
neutrality
by
bringing
about
a
record
cop
of
bootleggers
and
as
the
success
of
prohibition
is
so
overwhelming
that
it
is
bound
to
become
a
commonplace
of
civilization
you
must
regard
it
as
at
least
possible
that
you
will
some
day
make
the
paper
socialist
and
dry
with
a
capital
therefore
do
not
undertake
to
oppose
anything
stand
for
what
you
propose
to
advocate
whether
as
to
property
or
drink
or
anything
else
but
state
your
solutions
as
antitheses
by
the
way
do
propose
equal
distribution
of
land
it
is
like
equal
distribution
of
metal
rough
on
those
who
get
the
lead
and
rather
too
jolly
for
those
who
get
the
gold
your
equal
distribution
must
come
to
equal
distribution
of
the
national
income
in
terms
of
money
the
a
year
is
absurd
do
you
realize
that
it
is
at
rates
and
subject
to
heavy
taxation
net
you
have
sold
yourself
into
slavery
for
ten
years
for
a
week
are
you
quite
mad
make
it
at
least
plus
payment
for
copy
ever
of
course
it
was
not
merely
a
question
of
inadequate
payment
for
his
work
as
time
went
on
a
large
part
of
the
financial
burden
of
the
paper
had
to
be
carried
by
him
lord
howard
de
walden
helped
generously
and
so
did
chivers
other
donations
came
in
but
mostly
very
small
ones
no
proper
accounts
were
kept
no
watch
on
how
the
money
went
and
from
time
to
time
gilbert
would
pay
off
a
printing
bill
of
or
so
and
go
ahead
hoping
for
better
times
the
money
aspect
did
not
worry
him
i
think
at
first
there
was
always
more
to
be
made
by
a
little
extra
effort
though
a
time
was
to
come
when
every
extra
effort
wearied
him
cruelly
but
there
was
one
thing
he
could
not
bear
quarrels
on
the
board
or
on
the
staff
and
above
all
the
suggestion
that
he
should
adjudicate
he
was
a
bad
judge
of
men
one
of
his
staff
told
me
he
never
shirked
an
intellectual
issue
but
in
a
practical
crisis
he
was
inclined
to
slide
out
he
could
never
said
another
stand
up
to
accusations
from
one
man
against
another
the
first
start
was
made
with
the
existing
staff
of
three
miss
dunham
was
and
was
usually
left
to
see
the
paper
through
the
press
would
come
up
once
or
twice
a
week
and
dictate
his
own
articles
you
never
knew
when
he
was
coming
she
says
but
you
always
knew
when
he
was
there
by
the
smell
of
his
cigar
he
was
practically
a
chain
smoker
and
he
always
used
the
same
brand
he
left
drawings
on
the
blotter
and
everything
else
he
had
no
idea
of
time
and
when
he
said
i
think
i
go
out
now
he
might
stay
out
an
hour
or
so
or
he
might
not
return
at
all
lighting
a
cigar
or
cigarette
he
would
make
a
sign
in
the
air
with
the
match
he
never
omitted
this
ritual
and
miss
dunham
thinks
it
became
like
tapping
the
railings
was
to
johnson
he
used
to
come
in
and
swing
about
on
his
little
feet
she
said
and
it
is
true
that
his
feet
like
his
voice
seemed
too
small
to
belong
to
the
rest
of
him
her
great
difficulty
was
that
she
could
not
get
him
to
read
and
select
among
the
contributions
too
often
this
was
left
to
her
and
she
felt
painfully
inadequate
to
the
task
for
the
first
year
all
the
notes
of
the
week
were
written
by
then
he
got
titterton
as
assistant
editor
and
after
that
said
the
assistant
editor
with
simplicity
you
could
always
tell
good
titterton
from
bad
chesterton
everyone
who
worked
at
the
office
adored
especially
the
little
people
typists
secretaries
office
boys
he
was
so
kind
miss
dunham
said
he
never
got
angry
he
never
minded
being
interrupted
if
his
papers
blew
away
he
never
got
impatient
his
patience
hurt
one
she
had
never
seen
him
angry
that
the
paper
was
ever
got
out
seems
wonderful
as
the
staff
recall
those
days
yet
i
think
that
all
the
stories
about
inefficiency
as
editor
have
contributed
towards
an
impression
that
i
shared
myself
until
quite
lately
that
was
immeasurably
inferior
to
the
going
more
carefully
through
the
files
i
have
begun
to
question
that
impression
the
paper
was
produced
under
certain
obvious
disadvantages
even
spending
some
days
a
week
in
london
and
telephoning
freely
it
is
not
easy
to
edit
a
paper
from
the
country
gilbert
thought
of
himself
as
a
bad
editor
and
was
not
in
fact
a
very
good
one
the
contributions
he
accepted
were
uneven
in
quality
both
leaders
and
notes
of
the
week
when
not
written
by
him
tended
to
be
weak
imitations
of
either
himself
or
belloc
tinged
at
times
with
an
air
of
omniscience
tolerable
in
belloc
but
quite
intolerable
in
his
imitators
just
occasionally
the
equally
unedited
notes
and
leader
were
in
contradiction
of
each
other
yet
the
paper
remains
an
exceedingly
interesting
one
analysing
my
earlier
and
late
impressions
i
concluded
that
my
earlier
feeling
of
boredom
sprang
from
the
inevitable
effect
of
the
coming
first
and
therefore
having
been
read
first
it
is
a
disadvantage
of
consistency
that
as
bernard
shaw
remarked
you
have
said
the
same
thing
you
have
told
the
same
story
so
often
as
the
years
go
by
taking
a
rest
of
a
year
and
returning
fresh
to
i
was
surprised
at
finding
how
much
i
enjoyed
reading
it
and
also
at
finding
that
it
had
been
of
more
practical
use
than
i
remembered
to
the
cause
it
served
the
trend
of
the
whole
world
is
to
make
the
state
powerful
and
the
family
powerless
it
was
something
that
in
these
years
should
have
helped
to
smash
two
bills
of
this
mental
deficiency
and
the
canal
children
bills
both
these
aimed
at
taking
children
from
their
parents
the
first
in
the
cause
of
health
the
second
of
education
against
both
gilbert
wrote
brilliantly
and
successfully
has
much
more
in
it
and
quite
as
much
belloc
as
in
the
earlier
years
of
the
eric
gill
too
long
a
friend
of
the
chestertons
became
the
chief
contributor
on
art
in
he
spent
a
night
at
top
meadow
to
discuss
the
policy
of
the
paper
especially
with
reference
to
industrialism
and
art
a
little
later
the
gills
moved
from
wales
much
nearer
to
beaconsfield
and
the
two
men
met
fairly
often
gill
letters
are
interesting
they
are
mostly
before
the
visit
to
beaconsfield
and
probably
led
to
it
he
begins
by
attacking
gilbert
for
supporting
orpenism
as
against
byzantinism
and
thinking
that
the
art
of
painting
with
giotto
whereas
giotto
was
really
much
more
the
end
in
june
was
asking
him
to
write
about
epstein
gill
agreed
to
do
so
but
insisted
that
chesterton
and
belloc
must
not
disagree
with
him
but
accept
my
doctrine
as
the
doctrine
of
in
matters
of
art
just
as
i
accept
yours
in
other
matters
i
intend
to
write
for
you
as
an
outsider
have
i
not
put
almost
my
last
quid
into
your
blooming
company
or
not
god
forbid
that
you
should
have
an
art
critic
who
go
round
the
picture
shows
for
you
and
write
bilge
about
this
painter
and
that
this
and
that
in
the
first
state
of
effervescence
the
labour
he
delighted
in
quite
deadened
the
pain
of
the
editor
chair
gilbert
was
prepared
if
necessary
to
write
the
whole
paper
and
to
treat
it
as
a
variant
on
the
toy
theatre
or
the
sword
stick
it
was
said
that
the
chicago
pork
machine
used
every
part
of
a
pig
except
the
squeal
it
might
be
said
that
the
fleet
street
press
machine
uses
only
the
squeal
in
short
nobody
reading
the
newspapers
could
form
the
faintest
notion
of
how
intelligent
we
newspaper
people
are
the
whole
machine
is
made
to
chop
up
each
mind
into
meaningless
fragments
and
waste
the
vast
mass
even
of
those
such
a
thing
as
one
complete
human
being
appearing
in
the
press
is
almost
unknown
and
when
an
attempt
is
made
at
it
it
necessarily
has
a
certain
air
of
eccentric
egotism
that
is
a
risk
which
i
am
obliged
to
run
everywhere
in
this
paper
and
especially
on
this
page
as
i
have
said
the
whole
business
of
actually
putting
a
paper
together
is
a
new
game
for
me
to
play
to
amuse
my
second
childhood
and
it
combines
some
of
the
characters
of
a
jigsaw
and
a
crossword
puzzle
but
at
least
i
am
called
upon
to
do
a
great
many
different
sorts
of
things
and
am
not
tied
down
to
that
trivial
specialism
of
the
proletarian
press
march
and
again
this
paper
exists
to
insist
on
the
rights
of
man
on
possessions
that
are
of
much
more
political
importance
than
the
principle
of
one
man
one
vote
i
am
in
favour
of
one
man
one
house
one
man
one
field
nay
i
have
even
advanced
the
paradox
of
one
man
one
wife
but
i
am
almost
tempted
to
add
the
more
ideal
fancy
of
one
man
one
magazine
to
say
that
every
citizen
ought
to
have
a
weekly
paper
of
this
sort
to
splash
about
in
this
kind
of
scrap
book
to
keep
him
quiet
april
goes
on
to
talk
of
an
old
idea
of
his
that
a
young
journalist
should
write
one
article
for
the
and
another
for
the
and
then
put
them
into
the
wrong
envelopes
it
is
that
sort
of
contrast
and
that
sort
of
combination
that
i
am
going
to
aim
at
in
this
paper
i
can
not
see
why
convictions
should
look
dull
or
why
jokes
should
be
insincere
i
should
like
a
man
to
pick
up
this
paper
for
amusement
and
find
himself
involved
in
an
argument
i
should
like
him
to
pursue
it
purely
for
the
sake
of
argument
and
find
himself
pulled
up
short
by
a
joke
i
never
can
see
why
a
thing
should
not
be
both
popular
and
serious
that
is
in
the
sense
of
being
both
popular
and
sincere
for
the
paper
had
a
most
serious
purpose
he
acknowledged
its
defects
of
bad
printing
which
the
printers
indignantly
denied
bad
bad
editing
and
claimed
to
raise
against
the
banner
of
advertisement
the
noble
banner
of
apology
because
a
creative
revolution
was
what
he
wanted
words
and
forms
were
hard
to
find
it
was
easy
to
dress
up
stale
ideas
in
a
new
dress
but
the
terminology
for
something
outside
the
old
hack
party
programmes
had
to
be
fresh
minted
he
proposed
various
changes
after
a
few
months
running
and
introduced
them
thus
we
should
be
only
too
glad
if
for
this
week
only
our
readers
would
have
the
tact
to
retire
and
leave
us
alone
we
are
in
a
hegelian
condition
a
condition
not
so
much
of
being
as
of
becoming
and
no
generous
person
should
spy
on
an
unfortunate
fellow
creature
who
is
going
through
the
horrible
and
degrading
experience
of
being
a
hegelian
it
is
even
more
embarrassing
than
being
caught
in
the
very
act
of
evolution
which
every
clear
headed
person
would
desire
to
avoid
december
in
this
number
he
began
return
of
don
and
also
a
sort
of
scrapbook
he
invited
contributions
dealing
with
every
sort
of
approach
to
distributism
and
promised
more
than
one
series
of
constructive
proposals
and
definite
schemes
of
legislation
we
do
not
promise
that
all
these
schemes
will
exactly
agree
with
each
other
or
that
we
shall
agree
with
all
of
them
some
will
be
more
conservative
some
more
drastic
than
our
own
view
this
article
ends
on
an
ambitious
note
very
varying
schemes
will
be
admitted
but
the
idea
of
the
paper
will
thereby
be
strengthened
not
destroyed
for
what
we
desire
is
not
a
paltry
party
programme
but
a
renaissance
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
demanded
a
revolution
but
as
the
depression
hit
our
country
and
big
business
seemed
less
and
less
capable
of
coping
with
it
the
demand
became
more
understandable
and
the
fight
against
monopoly
more
urgent
a
thinking
man
should
always
attack
the
strongest
thing
in
his
own
time
for
the
strongest
thing
of
the
time
is
always
too
strong
the
great
outstanding
fact
and
feature
of
our
time
is
monopoly
april
i
have
already
referred
to
a
debate
on
monopoly
between
chesterton
and
gordon
selfridge
in
which
selfridge
with
the
familiar
unreality
of
the
millionaire
maintained
that
there
was
no
such
thing
anyone
was
free
to
open
a
store
in
rivalry
of
selfridge
or
to
start
a
paper
that
should
eclipse
the
mail
the
only
real
monopoly
he
added
gracefully
was
that
of
a
genius
like
chesterton
whose
work
the
ordinary
man
could
not
emulate
the
graceful
compliment
chesterton
answered
by
offering
to
share
his
last
epigram
with
selfridge
but
as
to
the
main
contention
what
could
he
say
it
was
at
once
too
easy
and
absolutely
impossible
to
answer
such
a
speech
or
more
truly
such
a
speaker
only
in
a
country
of
the
blind
could
he
have
won
a
hearing
but
chesterton
persevered
even
in
the
shadow
of
large
scale
unemployment
had
begun
and
at
this
singularly
inappropriate
time
came
the
empire
exhibition
at
wembley
in
the
failure
of
its
appeal
chesterton
saw
hope
for
he
believed
that
from
a
frank
facing
of
truth
his
country
might
yet
conquer
the
coming
perils
that
was
the
real
weakness
of
wembley
that
it
so
completely
mistook
the
english
temperament
as
to
appeal
to
a
stale
mood
it
appealed
to
a
stale
mood
of
success
when
we
need
to
appeal
to
a
new
and
more
noble
mood
of
failure
or
at
least
of
peril
the
english
no
longer
care
to
be
told
of
an
empire
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
tell
them
the
sun
is
setting
and
they
will
fight
though
the
battle
go
against
them
to
the
going
down
of
the
sun
if
they
do
not
stay
it
like
joshua
we
seriously
propose
that
england
should
take
her
stand
among
the
unhappy
nations
it
is
too
dismal
a
fate
to
go
on
being
one
of
the
happy
ones
we
must
be
as
proud
as
spain
and
poland
and
serbia
nations
made
more
dear
to
their
lovers
by
their
disasters
our
disasters
have
begun
but
they
do
not
seem
to
have
endeared
us
to
anybody
in
particular
our
sorrow
has
come
but
we
gain
no
extra
loyalty
by
it
the
time
has
come
to
claim
our
crown
of
thorns
or
at
least
not
to
cover
it
any
longer
with
such
exceedingly
faded
flowers
march
always
chesterton
was
haunted
by
the
present
war
he
had
seen
the
prussian
peril
conquered
he
saw
it
rising
again
even
before
the
advent
of
hitler
he
knew
that
the
tribe
which
had
stolen
from
austria
and
denmark
had
invaded
france
and
crushed
poland
was
without
repentance
and
he
feared
that
again
the
stupidity
or
the
greed
behind
english
and
american
policy
was
giving
it
another
opportunity
those
sturdy
teutons
he
wrote
ironically
from
whom
we
were
descended
up
to
the
outbreak
of
the
great
war
and
from
whom
we
are
now
showing
signs
of
being
descended
again
the
misfortune
was
that
englishmen
had
ceased
to
try
to
get
free
from
a
secret
government
conducted
by
we
know
not
whom
and
achieving
we
know
not
what
the
real
national
life
of
our
country
is
unconscious
of
its
own
national
policy
the
right
hand
of
the
englishman
that
holds
the
plough
or
the
sword
knows
not
what
his
left
hand
doth
with
the
pen
and
the
man
is
man
and
mond
is
master
of
his
fate
for
our
government
he
apologised
to
france
he
saw
it
as
one
and
the
same
fight
against
a
heathenish
money
power
and
heathen
prussia
and
the
beating
of
the
dark
wings
of
enemy
aeroplanes
sounded
in
his
dreams
as
early
as
he
wrote
a
christmas
play
of
george
and
the
dragon
in
which
the
turkish
knight
embodied
his
vision
of
prussia
and
george
spoke
prophetically
for
england
saint
george
i
know
that
this
is
sure
whatever
man
can
do
man
can
endure
though
you
shall
loose
all
laws
of
fight
and
fashion
a
torture
chamber
from
a
tilting
yard
though
iron
hard
as
doom
grow
hot
as
passion
man
shall
be
hotter
man
shall
be
more
hard
and
when
an
army
in
your
hell
fire
faints
you
shall
find
martyrs
who
were
never
saints
they
wound
each
other
and
the
doctor
comes
to
the
help
of
the
turkish
knight
princess
why
should
we
patch
this
pirate
up
again
why
should
you
always
win
and
win
in
vain
bid
him
not
cut
the
leg
but
cut
the
loss
saint
george
i
will
not
fire
upon
my
own
red
cross
princess
if
you
lay
there
would
he
let
you
escape
saint
george
i
am
his
conqueror
and
not
his
ape
doctor
be
not
so
sure
of
conquering
he
shall
rise
on
lighter
feet
on
feet
that
vault
the
skies
science
shall
make
a
mighty
foot
and
new
light
as
the
feather
feet
of
perseus
flew
long
as
the
seven
leagued
boots
in
tales
gone
by
this
shall
bestride
the
sea
and
ride
the
sky
thus
shall
he
fly
and
beat
above
your
nation
the
clashing
pinions
of
apocalypse
ye
shall
be
deep
sea
fish
in
pale
prostration
under
the
sky
foam
of
his
flying
ships
when
terror
above
your
cities
dropping
doom
shall
shut
all
england
in
a
lampless
tomb
your
widows
and
your
orphans
now
forlorn
shall
be
no
safer
than
the
dead
they
mourn
when
all
their
lights
grow
dark
their
lives
grow
gray
what
will
those
widows
and
those
orphans
say
saint
george
saint
george
for
merrie
england
he
saw
the
aeroplanes
in
vision
and
he
saw
courage
and
patriotism
i
think
he
must
rejoice
today
that
betrayal
of
the
allied
cause
has
not
been
at
the
hands
of
an
englishman
he
had
said
many
hard
things
about
the
english
aristocracy
and
gentry
but
these
two
virtues
he
had
always
granted
were
theirs
and
in
his
vision
he
saw
hope
england
may
soon
be
poor
enough
to
be
praised
with
an
undivided
heart
we
are
not
sure
that
the
ruins
of
wembley
may
not
be
the
restoration
of
westminster
it
is
when
a
nation
has
recovered
from
the
illusion
of
owning
everything
that
it
discovers
that
it
does
stand
for
something
and
for
that
something
it
will
fight
with
a
lucid
and
just
tenacity
which
no
mere
megalomania
can
comprehend
we
are
not
so
perverse
as
to
wish
to
see
england
ruined
that
she
may
be
respected
but
we
do
think
she
will
be
happy
in
having
the
sort
of
respect
that
could
remain
even
if
she
were
ruined
patriotic
as
the
english
have
always
been
the
patriotism
of
their
educated
class
has
seldom
had
this
peculiar
sort
of
extra
energy
that
is
given
by
a
conscience
completely
at
rest
if
that
were
added
they
might
well
make
such
a
stand
as
would
astound
the
world
all
their
other
virtues
their
humour
and
sporting
spirit
and
freedom
from
the
morbidities
and
cruelties
of
fatigue
might
enter
into
their
full
heritage
when
joined
to
the
integrity
and
intellectual
dignity
that
belong
to
self
defence
and
self
respect
we
are
far
from
sure
that
the
world
has
not
yet
to
see
our
nation
in
its
finest
phase
what
may
be
in
the
womb
of
night
we
know
not
nor
what
are
those
dim
outlines
that
show
on
the
horizon
in
truth
he
wrote
no
man
knows
how
near
we
are
to
death
or
to
dawn
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
am
making
this
speech
from
a
scaffolding
or
a
scaffold
it
is
easy
for
the
young
to
undertake
hard
things
they
never
know
how
hard
they
are
and
they
are
certain
of
success
the
lessons
of
experience
signify
to
the
young
that
other
men
have
failed
their
own
experience
shall
teach
others
the
meaning
of
success
but
to
begin
again
at
fifty
with
the
special
spring
of
youth
gone
and
with
the
sad
lessons
of
one
own
experience
in
the
mind
this
calls
indeed
for
a
rare
courage
gilbert
knew
all
the
cost
in
time
energy
money
and
reputation
that
he
would
have
to
pay
that
he
did
pay
and
he
stood
increasingly
alone
cecil
had
been
the
irreparable
loss
but
others
of
the
old
circle
were
dropping
out
and
their
places
were
not
filled
jack
phillimore
death
in
was
a
heavy
blow
to

you
go
before
me
on
all
roads
on
bridges
broad
enough
to
spread
between
the
learned
and
the
dunce
between
the
living
and
the
dead
the
gulf
between
the
socialist
group
and
the
distributist
had
become
far
more
obvious
than
of
yore
shaw
and
wells
would
still
write
for
but
only
because
he
was
their
friend
if
eccles
if
desmond
mccarthy
today
contributed
it
would
too
be
chiefly
from
affection
for
gilbert
one
article
by
mccarthy
described
the
old
days
when
the
original
was
in
being
and
he
cecil
and
belloc
sat
around
the
table
editing
it
and
sticking
triolets
thrown
off
in
hot
haste
into
those
nasty
little
spaces
left
by
articles
that
did
not
quite
fit
or
supplying
three
or
four
articles
and
a
ballade
urbane
while
the
printers
waited
we
have
to
print
a
triolet
when
space
is
clamouring
for
matter
we
try
to
put
it
off
and
yet
we
have
to
print
a
triolet
it
is
with
infinite
regret
that
we
admit
the
silly
patter
we
have
to
print
a
triolet
when
space
is
clamouring
for
matter
such
joyous
scrambles
are
proper
to
youth
and
now
none
of
them
were
young
all
authors
worthy
of
the
name
have
found
their
platform
and
made
permanent
engagements
by
middle
life
professional
men
are
absorbed
by
work
and
life
they
simply
had
not
time
to
give
as
of
yore
to
build
up
this
venture
the
names
of
shaw
and
wells
continue
to
appear
among
the
contributors
often
enough
in
religious
debate
reading
the
files
and
visiting
the
two
men
to
talk
of
gilbert
i
made
one
discovery
that
is
curious
from
whichever
side
you
look
at
it
two
able
and
indeed
brilliant
men
betrayed
not
only
an
amazing
degree
of
ignorance
concerning
the
tenets
of
catholicism
but
also
a
bland
conviction
that
they
knew
them
well
wells
in
conversation
based
his
claim
on
the
fact
that
he
had
long
been
intimately
acquainted
with
an
shaw
i
fancy
felt
he
must
know
all
about
something
that
had
surrounded
him
in
infancy
for
as
the
reader
must
have
noticed
he
is
much
preoccupied
by
the
thought
of
his
irish
descent
and
education
but
what
seems
to
me
even
stranger
about
the
situation
is
the
absence
on
the
catholic
side
of
any
effort
to
explain
to
these
men
the
doctrines
they
misconstrued
when
wells
for
instance
gave
a
crude
and
inaccurate
statement
of
the
doctrine
of
the
fall
belloc
laughed
at
him
chesterton
and
father
mcnabb
both
wrote
long
and
picturesque
articles
illuminating
to
a
believer
but
as
instruction
to
an
unbeliever
quite
useless
a
correspondence
that
seemed
likely
to
drag
on
forever
ended
abruptly
with
wells
asking
about
the
fall
tell
me
did
it
really
happen
to
which
chesterton
briefly
replied
yes
i
imagine
he
thought
he
and
the
other
writers
had
said
this
several
times
already
but
in
fact
they
had
not
perhaps
they
did
not
realise
where
the
beginning
must
be
made
in
instructing
otherwise
instructed
men
on
the
subject
of
catholicism
it
is
all
very
interesting
and
curious
but
it
largely
explains
why
bernard
shaw
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
gilbert
believed
in
transubstantiation
has
any
catholic
ever
explained
the
philosophic
meaning
of
transubstantiation
to
the
great
old
irish
man
of
english
letters
even
gilbert
was
perhaps
too
much
inclined
simply
to
play
the
fool
in
fashion
with
those
who
attacked
the
faith
in
his
paper
or
other
papers
but
then
how
well
he
played
it
here
are
some
imaginary
interviews
on
the
recently
discovered
traces
of
an
actual
historical
flood
a
discovery
which
has
shaken
the
christian
world
to
its
foundations
by
its
apparent
agreement
with
the
book
of
genesis
the
dean
of
paul
remarked
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
cause
for
alarm
protestantism
is
still
founded
on
an
impregnable
rock
on
that
deep
and
strong
foundation
of
disbelief
in
the
bible
which
supports
the
spiritual
and
intellectual
life
of
all
true
christians
today
even
if
dark
doubts
should
arise
and
it
should
seem
for
the
moment
as
if
certain
passages
in
the
scripture
story
were
true
we
must
not
lose
heart
the
cloud
will
pass
and
we
have
still
the
priceless
possession
of
the
open
bible
with
all
its
inexhaustible
supply
of
errors
and
inconsistencies
a
continual
source
of
interest
to
scholars
and
a
permanent
bulwark
against
rome
wells
exclaimed
i
am
interested
in
the
flood
of
the
future
not
in
any
of
these
little
local
floods
that
may
have
taken
place
in
the
past
i
want
a
broader
larger
more
complete
and
coordinated
sort
of
flood
a
flood
that
will
really
cover
the
whole
ground
i
want
to
get
people
to
understand
that
in
the
future
we
shall
not
divide
water
in
this
petty
way
into
potty
little
ponds
and
lakes
and
rivers
it
will
be
one
big
satisfying
thing
the
same
everywhere
moi
le
belloc
in
his
boorish
boozy
way
may
question
my
knowledge
of
french
but
i
fancy
that
quotation
will
settle
him
march
on
the
favourite
topic
of
modern
advertisement
having
read
an
essay
which
said
that
good
salesmanship
made
everything
in
the
garden
beautiful
gilbert
again
thought
of
genesis
there
was
only
one
actor
in
that
ancient
drama
who
seems
to
have
had
any
real
talent
for
salesmanship
he
seems
to
have
undertaken
to
deliver
the
goods
with
exactly
the
right
preliminaries
of
promises
and
praise
he
knew
all
about
advertisement
we
may
say
he
knew
all
about
publicity
though
not
at
the
moment
addressing
a
very
large
public
he
not
only
took
up
the
slogan
of
eat
more
fruit
but
he
distinctly
declared
that
any
customers
purchasing
his
particular
brand
of
fruit
would
instantly
become
as
gods
and
as
this
is
exactly
what
is
promised
to
the
purchasers
of
every
patent
medicine
popular
tonic
saline
draught
or
medicinal
wine
at
the
present
day
there
can
be
no
question
that
he
was
in
advance
of
his
age
it
is
extraordinary
that
humanity
which
began
with
the
apple
and
ended
with
the
patent
medicine
has
not
even
yet
become
exactly
like
gods
it
is
still
more
extraordinary
and
probably
the
result
of
a
malicious
interpolation
by
priests
at
a
later
date
that
the
record
ends
with
some
extraordinary
remarks
to
the
effect
that
one
thus
pursuing
the
bright
career
of
salesmanship
is
condemned
to
crawl
on
his
stomach
and
eat
a
great
deal
of
dirt
march
the
relation
between
belloc
and
the
paper
as
between
belloc
and
gilbert
himself
was
a
unique
one
not
indeed
its
onlie
begetter
he
was
equally
with
cecil
begetter
of
the
original
paper
and
its
first
editor
he
was
gilbert
chief
guide
to
the
historical
and
political
scene
of
europe
both
men
shared
had
fought
all
their
lives
for
their
ideas
of
freedom
the
family
restoration
of
property
and
all
that
is
involved
in
catholic
christianity
and
belloc
said
repeatedly
that
he
had
no
platform
for
the
continuous
expression
of
these
ideas
such
books
as
his
of
the
found
still
as
wide
a
public
as
had
path
to
a
quarter
century
earlier
and
in
those
books
his
philosophy
may
be
read
but
he
had
too
urgent
commentaries
on
foreign
affairs
and
current
politics
and
for
these
became
his
platform
as
completely
as
the
had
been
in
the
past
to
gilbert
this
appeared
one
chief
value
of
his
paper
in
an
article
from
which
i
quote
in
the
next
chapter
he
gives
it
as
one
of
the
two
reasons
for
which
he
toiled
to
keep
in
existence
week
by
week
belloc
on
current
or
foreign
affairs
wrote
of
what
was
happening
and
what
would
presently
come
of
it
and
who
can
say
reading
those
articles
today
that
it
would
not
have
changed
the
defeats
of
this
war
into
victory
at
a
far
earlier
date
had
our
statesmen
read
and
heeded
the
analysis
for
instance
of
the
peril
of
the
aeroplane
of
the
threat
to
the
empire
from
japan
the
importance
of
keeping
italy
friendship
in
the
mediterranean
the
growing
strength
of
germany
and
the
awful
risk
we
took
in
allowing
her
to
rearm
in
failing
to
arm
against
her
whether
he
was
right
or
as
many
held
wildly
wrong
about
what
underlay
our
failures
of
judgment
his
views
must
be
briefly
traced
because
of
their
effect
on
gilbert
and
others
in
the
financial
world
he
saw
england
in
the
first
years
after
the
war
dominated
by
the
international
banking
power
which
made
us
as
it
were
a
local
branch
of
wall
street
in
his
view
it
was
the
bankers
both
of
america
and
england
who
first
insisted
that
germany
could
not
pay
her
reparations
and
later
made
england
repudiate
her
own
war
debts
to
america
though
she
had
he
showed
already
paid
in
interest
and
principal
more
than
half
of
what
had
been
lent
the
banks
did
this
because
they
had
lent
commercially
both
to
germany
and
england
sums
whose
safety
meant
more
to
them
than
moneys
merely
owing
to
the
nations
which
would
not
benefit
the
banks
england
thus
became
subservient
to
the
united
states
and
had
to
follow
american
financial
policies
it
was
these
policies
that
led
to
the
abandonment
of
the
unwritten
alliance
with
france
and
especially
to
allowing
germany
to
rearm
helped
by
loans
from
these
same
banks
to
reoccupy
the
rhineland
and
remilitarise
the
ruhr
next
in
belloc
view
came
a
worse
stage
yet
in
which
the
banks
had
given
place
to
big
business
which
was
increasingly
controlling
parliament
the
plutocracy
that
had
bit
by
bit
eaten
into
our
aristocracy
and
gained
ascendancy
in
the
govemment
was
not
like
our
ancient
aristocracy
trained
for
the
business
and
was
utterly
uninformed
especially
in
foreign
affairs
the
one
remaining
hope
the
permanent
officials
especially
of
the
foreign
office
were
less
and
less
listened
to
latterly
he
held
too
that
even
the
foreign
office
had
lost
its
old
sure
touch
hence
a
constant
vacillation
in
our
policies
which
weakened
england
position
and
made
certain
some
terrible
disaster
this
fear
is
ever
present
in
belloc
articles
and
ever
brooded
on
by
the
editor
he
rallied
his
forces
to
urge
week
after
week
the
possible
alternative
to
disaster
the
recovery
by
the
people
of
england
of
power
and
freedom
the
restoration
of
england
to
its
place
in
a
restored
europe
freed
from
the
german
menace
despite
the
natural
high
spirits
a
certain
gloom
and
more
than
a
touch
of
fierceness
mark
the
work
of
these
years
summing
up
the
twenties
of
the
century
chesterton
saw
them
as
singularly
bankrupt
spiritually
and
intellectually
and
he
foresaw
from
their
sowing
a
miserable
harvest
chapter
xxvi
the
distributist
league
and
distributism
say
we
must
have
socialism
or
capitalism
is
like
saying
we
must
choose
between
all
men
going
into
monasteries
and
a
few
men
having
harems
if
i
denied
such
a
sexual
alternative
i
should
not
need
to
call
myself
a
monogamist
i
should
be
content
to
call

a

number
of
from
grew
the
distributist
league
its
start
in
was
marked
by
intense
enthusiasm
and
its
progress
was
recorded
week
by
week
in
the
paper
the
inaugural
meeting
took
place
in
essex
hall
essex
street
strand
on
september
summed
up
their
aim
in
the
words
their
simple
idea
was
to
restore
possession
he
added
that
francis
bacon
had
long
ago
said
property
is
like
muck
it
is
good
only
if
it
be
spread
the
following
week
the
first
committee
meeting
took
place
chesterton
was
elected
president
captain
went
secretary
and
maurice
reckitt
treasurer
it
was
planned
to
form
a
branch
in
birmingham
alternative
names
were
discussed
the
cobbett
club
the
luddite
league
the
league
of
small
property
the
cow
and
acres
however
suitable
as
the
name
of
a
public
house
at
which
we
could
assemble
is
too
limited
as
an
economic
statement
the
league
of
the
little
people
president
chesterton
may
seem
at
first
too
suggestive
of
the
fairies
but
it
has
been
strongly
supported
among
us
and
again
suppose
we
call
our
movement
the
lost
property
league
the
idea
of
the
restoration
of
lost
property
is
far
more
essential
to
our
whole
conception
than
even
the
idea
of
liberty
as
now
commonly
understood
the
liberty
and
property
defense
league
implies
that
property
is
there
to
be
defended
the
lost

describes
the
exact
state
of
the
case
from
an
article

another
later
article
in
october
another
meeting
of
the
central
branch
was
held
in
essex

to
debate
have
we
lost

the
croydon
and
birmingham
branches
were
arranging
meetings

with

to

bath
held
its
first
public
meeting
with
the
mayor
in
the
chair
and
the
meeting
had
to
overflow
into
a
very
large
hall
it
was
decided
to
reduce
the
price
of
the
paper
to
twopence
twopenny
was
the
title
of
the
leading
article
in
order
to
give
the
league
an
opportunity
of
extending
the
paper
radius
of
action
as
an
organ
of
the
league
principles
every
reader
who
has
been
buying
one
copy
at
sixpence
must
take
three
copies
at
until
his
two
surplus
copies
have
secured
two
new
readers
the
league
would
have
to
make
itself
responsible
for
the
success
of
this
experiment
and
save
the
paper
which
gave
it
birth
or
die
of
inanition
for
it
is
certainly
not
yet
strong
enough
to
leave
its
mother
this
was
the
name
given
to
cobbett
by
his
enemies
november
it
is
clear
that
gilbert
hopes
at
this
stage
ran
high
he
had
not
dreamed
that
the
initial
success
of
the
league
would
be
so
great
recording
a
sensational
increase
in
the
sale
of
the
paper
he
wrote
on
november
it
was
when
we
faced
defeat
that
we
were
surprised
by
victory
and
we
are
quite
serious
in
believing
that
this
is
part
of
a
practical
philosophy
that
may
yet
outlast
the
philosophy
of
bluff
recording
a
meeting
of
the
league
he
wrote
we
find
it
difficult
to
express
the
effect
the
meeting
had
upon
us
we
were
astonished
we
were
overwhelmed
had
we
anything
to
do
with
the
making
of
this
ardent
eager
indefatigable
creature
the
answer
is
of
course
that
though
we
had
something
to
do
with
the
shaping
of
the
body
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
birth
of
the
soul
that
was
a
miracle
a
miracle
we
had
hoped
for
and
which
yet
when
it
happened
overwhelmed
us
we
have
the
happy
feeling
that
we
have
helped
to
shape
something
which
will
go
far
above
and
beyond
us
there
were
well
over
members
present
many
of
them
spoke
and
nearly
all
the
others
would
have
spoken
if
there
had
been
time
to
hear
them
it
was
a
great
night
november
father
vincent
mcnabb
has
said
truly
that
there
are
no
words
for
the
real
things
thus
distributism
is
not
only
a
rather
ugly
word
but
also
a
word
holding
less
than
half
the
content
of
the
idea
they
were
aiming
at
belloc
covered
more
of
it
in
the
title
of
his
book
the
of
while
perhaps
a
better
name
still
was
outline
of
this
chesterton
had
chosen
for
a
series
of
articles
that
became
a
book
he
was
asking
for
a
return
to
the
sanity
of
field
and
workshop
of
craftsman
and
peasant
from
the
insanity
of
trusts
and
machinery
of
unemployment
and
starvation
we
are
destroying
food
because
we
do
not
need
it
we
are
starving
men
because
we
do
not
need
them
after
the
first
meeting
of
the
league
the
notes
of
the
week
recorded
that
the
printing
order
for
the
paper
based
on
actual
demand
had
risen
in
two
weeks
from
to
of
course
we
owe
everything
to
the
league
which
in
manchester
liverpool
glasgow
croydon
chatham
worthing
chorley
cambridge
oxford
bath
and
london
has
made
the
newsagents
aware
of
the
paper
by
november
the
sales
had
risen
to

then
was
held
the
first
formal
meeting
of
the
central
branch
of
the
league
at
which
it
was
agreed
that
members
should
make
a
habit
of
dealing
at
small
shops
they
should
avoid
even
small
shops
which
sweat
their
employees
each
branch
should
prepare
a
list
of
small
shops
for
the
use
of
its
members
and
that
is
only
a
beginning
we
hope
to
enlist
the
support
of
the
small
farmer
and
the
small
master
craftsman
we
hope
little
by
little
to
put
the
small
producer
in
touch
with
the
small
retailer
we
hope
in
the
end
to
establish
within
the
state
a
community
almost
of
men
and
women
pledged
to
distributism
and
to
a
large
extent
practising
it
less
and
less
then
will
the
juggling
of
finance
have
power
over
us
for
it
does
not
matter
what
they
call
the
counters
when
you
are
exchanging
hams
for
handkerchiefs
or
pigs
for
pianos
the
cockpit
is
worth
reading
during
the
months
that
follow
for
here
were
voiced
any
criticisms
that
the
readers
had
to
make
of
the
paper
and
of
the
league
any
criticism
that
the
league
had
to
make
of
itself
there
was
plenty
many
leaguers
and
readers
felt
for
instance
that
the
spirit
of
criticism
of
others
was
too
fully
developed
in
the
paper
so
that
when
attempts
were
made
to
act
on
distributive
principles
by
people
not
in
league
with
the
league
they
were
given
short
shrift
instead
of
meeting
even
modified
encouragement
the
league
was
begged
to
spend
more
time
clarifying
its
principles
less
time
in
criticism
but
much
more
fundamental
was
the
constantly
recurrent
question
when
is
the
league
going
to
begin
to
do
something
to
this
the
answer
given
often
by
himself
was
that
while
the
league
hoped
in
time
to
create
that
community
of
which
he
had
written
its
own
work
was
only
that
of
propaganda
of
a
wider
and
wider
dissemination
of
the
principles
of
distributism
their
work
they
said
was
to
talk
outdoor
propaganda
started
in
glasgow
and
came
thence
to
london
in
october
the
secretary
said
they
must
convince
men
there
is
a
practical
alternative
to
capitalism
and
socialism
showing
them
how
to
set
about
achieving
it
and
in
november
he
subscribed
to
opinions
voiced
in
the
cockpit
for
the
last
two
years
by
saying
that
the
london
branch
acted
in
the
spirit
of
a
pleasant
friday
evening
debating
society
which
regarded
discussion
as
an
end
in
itself
one
would
imagine
that
all
this
meant
a
call
to
action
but
the
action
was
merely
the
establishment
of
a
research
department
and
the
start
of
a
new
paper
for
the
discussion
of
the
domestic
business
the
research
secretary
will
explain
his
plans
enroll
volunteers
and
allot
tasks
thus
equipping
the
league
with
the
information
for
lack
of
which
it
is
as
yet
unable
to
agree
on
practical
measures
the
effectiveness
of
its
propaganda
would
members
were
told
depend
on
its
research
the
pious
appointment
of
investigators
wrote
a
leader
in
in
reference
to
a
government
commission
to
report
what
is
already
common
knowledge
is
nothing
less
than
a
shifty
expedient
i
do
think
this
article
was
one
of
gilbert
but
i
do
wonder
whether
as
time
went
on
he
did
not
recall
his
own
old
comparison
between
the
early
christian
and
the
modern
socialist
for
distributists
far
more
than
socialists
should
have
been
vowed
to
action
there
was
a
grave
danger
both
of
making
their
propaganda
ineffective
by
lack
of
example
and
of
weakening
themselves
as
distributists
yet
there
were
many
difficulties
in
their
path
some
of
which
may
best
be
seen
if
we
go
back
a
little
and
recall
the
way
in
which
the
encyclical
was
received
by
catholics
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
written
in
europe
where
the
remains
of
the
mediaeval
social
structure
still
lingered
on
far
more
than
in
industrial
england
or
america
it
was
taken
by
the
more
conservative
catholics
as
a
general
confirmation
of
the
established
order
i
well
remember
people
like
my
own
father
and
father
bernard
vaughan
quoting
it
in
this
sense
and
if
they
tended
to
advert
to
only
one
half
of
it
the
more
radical
catholics
readily
obliged
by
appearing
conscious
solely
of
the
other
half
and
thus
enabling
themselves
to
be
dismissed
as
unfortunately
they
were
worse
than
they
were
curiously
blind
with
rare
exceptions
to
those
true
implications
of
the
document
which
spelt
distributism
for
which
the
word
had
not
then
been
coined
or
the
of
the
law
therefore
should
favour
ownership
and
its
policy
should
be
to
induce
as
many
people
as
possible
to
become
many
excellent
results
will
follow
from
this
and
first
of
all
property
will
certainly
become
more
equitably
divided
for
the
effect
of
social
change
and
revolution
has
been
to
divide
society
into
two
widely
different
castes
workpeople
can
be
encouraged
to
look
forward
to
obtaining
a
share
in
the
land
the
result
will
be
that
the
the
gulf
between
vast
wealth
and
deep
poverty
will
be
bridged
over
and
the
two
orders
will
be
brought
nearer
together
yet
the
pope
words
were
treated
almost
as
an
acceptance
of
the
existing
conditions
of
property
by
the
more
conservative
while
the
more
radical
simply
tried
to
evade
them
the
question
of
my
youth
undoubtedly
was
how
far
can
a
catholic
go
on
the
road
to
socialism
translation
in
husslein
christian
social
italics
mine
distributism
would
seem
today
to
have
cut
like
a
sword
the
knot
of
this
mental
confusion
but
it
did
not
do
so
for
many
people
i
suppose
the
leading
distributist
among
the
clergy
was
father
vincent
mcnabb
and
i
have
heard
him
called
a
socialist
a
hundred
times
and
even
among
those
who
had
accepted
the
distributist
ideal
and
had
now
had
fifteen
years
of
the
and
to
meditate
upon
to
say
nothing
of
the
belloc
and
chesterton
books
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
confusion
of
mind
to
be
cleared
up
the
chesterbelloc
had
begun
a
mental
revolution
but
even
the
mind
can
not
be
turned
upside
down
in
a
moment
of
time
and
then
there
is
the
will
to
be
considered
gilbert
often
claimed
that
the
society
he
advocated
was
the
norm
that
the
modern
world
was
abnormal
was
insane
but
to
achieve
the
normal
in
an
abnormal
world
calls
for
high
courage
and
a
high
degree
of
energy
it
is
much
easier
to
sit
and
drink
beer
while
planning
the
world
that
one
wishes
was
there
the
world
of
simplicity
hard
work
and
independence
and
about
the
details
of
this
new
world
there
was
room
for
a
variety
of
opinion
the
distributists
soon
began
to
argue
and
even
to
quarrel
about
the
admission
of
machinery
into
the
distributist
state
about
the
nature
of
one
another
distributism
and
what
was
necessary
to
constitute
a
distributist
the
effect
on
gilbert
is
interesting
for
it
showed
his
belief
in
the
importance
of
the
league
he
hoped
he
said
that
the
quarrel
would
not
turn
into
a
dispute
that
it
would
remain
a
personal
quarrel
for
impersonal
quarrel
is
schism
he
urged
again
and
again
that
the
dogmas
of
their
creed
should
be
defined
heaven
forbid
that
we
should
ever
be
true
distributists
as
a
substitute
for
being
distributists
it
would
be
a
dismal
thing
to
join
the
long
and
wavering
procession
of
true
christians
true
socialists
true
imperialists
who
are
now
progressing
drearily
into
a
featureless
future
ready
to
change
anything
whatever
except
their
names
these
people
escape
endlessly
by
refusing
definition
which
they
call
dogma
practical
politics
are
necessary
but
they
are
in
a
sense
narrow
and
by
themselves
they
do
tend
to
split
the
world
up
into
small
sects
only
dogma
is
sufficiently
universal
to
include
us
all
of
the
world
surrounding
him
which
refused
definitions
he
said
because
there
is
no
image
there
is
nothing
except
imaginaries
but
i
think
there
must
have
been
some
blushes
on
distributists
cheeks
as
they
read
his
apology
for
some
slight
absence
of
mind
he
explained
his
own
ghastly
ignorance
of
the
details
of
the
dispute
which
is
bound
up
with
the
economic
facts
of
the
position
with
the
fact
especially
of
october
my
own
highly
inadequate
rendering
of
the
part
of
the
financier
i
am
the
thin
and
shadowy
approximation
to
a
capitalist
i
could
only
manage
until
very
lately
to
keep
this
paper
in
existence
at
all
by
earning
the
money
in
the
open
market
and
more
especially
in
that
busy
and
happy
market
where
corpses
are
sold
in
batches
i
mean
the
mart
of
murder
and
mystery
the
booth
of
the
detective
story
many
a
squire
has
died
in
a
dank
garden
arbour
transfixed
by
a
mysterious
dagger
many
a
millionaire
has
perished
silently
though
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
private
secretaries
in
order
that
belloc
may
have
a
paper
in
which
he
is
allowed
to
point
out
that
a
great
empire
does
not
default
because
it
is
growing
richer
many
a
shot
has
rung
out
in
the
silent
night
many
a
constable
has
hurled
himself
through
a
crashing
door
from
under
which
there
crawled
a
crimson
stain
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
page
somewhere
for
kenrick
virile
and
logical
exposition
of
the
principles
of
distributism
many
an
imperial
jewel
has
vanished
from
its
golden
setting
many
a
detective
crawled
about
on
the
carpet
for
clues
before
some
of
those
little
printers
bills
could
be
settled
which
enabled
the
most
distinguished
and
intelligent
of
distributists
to
denounce
each
other
as
capitalists
and
communists
in
the
columns
of
the
cockpit
and
elsewhere
this
being
my
humble
and
even
highly
irrelevant
contribution
to
the
common
it
is
obvious
that
it
could
not
be
done
at
the
same
time
as
a
close
following
of
the
varying
shades
of
thought
in
the
distributist
debates
and
this
ignorance
of
mine
though
naturally
very
irritating
to
people
better
informed
has
at
least
the
advantage
of
giving
some
genuineness
to
my
impartiality
i
have
never
belonged
distinctively
to
any
of
the
different
distributist
groups
i
have
never
had
time
as
time
went
on
however
and
the
disputes
continued
he
wrote
a
series
of
which
have
in
them
that
note
so
special
to
him
so
embarrassing
to
some
of
his
admirers
of
deep
and
genuine
respect
for
every
person
and
every
opinion
the
small
numbers
of
the
distributists
the
greatness
of
the
work
to
be
done
by
them
would
make
any
split
in
their
ranks
a
tremendous
tragedy
the
difficulty
in
keeping
any
movement
in
being
was
that
of
holding
together
the
ardent
pioneers
and
the
rank
and
file
september
october
men
who
really
have
common
convictions
tend
to
break
up
it
is
only
those
who
have
no
convictions
who
always
hang
together
roughly
the
position
is
that
there
is
a
moderate
body
which
regards
extremists
as
visionary
a
more
extreme
body
which
regards
moderates
as
ineffective
and
lastly
a
catastrophic
simplification
in
the
social
scene
which
makes
the
simple
enthusiast
seem
more
fitted
to
the
simple
disaster
there
were
two
approaches
that
should
be
made
to
these
differences
the
first
was
to
state
the
fundamental
principles
of
distributism
the
crux
of
the
quarrel
was
the
question
of
machinery
but
even
those
who
held
that
machinery
should
be
abolished
in
the
distributist
state
held
it
he
claimed
not
as
a
first
principle
but
as
a
deduction
from
their
first
principles
chesterton
himself
felt
that
machinery
should
be
limited
but
not
abolished
the
order
of
things
had
been
historically
that
men
had
been
deprived
of
property
and
enslaved
on
the
land
before
the
of
industrialism
had
become
possible
the
whole
history
of
the
machine
might
have
been
reversed
in
a
state
of
free
men
if
a
machine
were
used
on
a
farm
employing
fifty
men
that
would
do
the
work
of
forty
it
means
forty
men
become
unemployed
but
it
is
only
because
they
were
employed
that
they
are
unemployed
now
you
and
i
i
hope
to
heaven
are
not
trying
to
increase
employment
it
is
almost
the
only
thing
that
is
as
bad
as
unemployment
in
other
words
he
did
not
want
men
to
be
employees
men
working
for
themselves
men
their
own
employers
their
own
employees
that
was
the
objective
of
distributism
a
wide
distribution
of
property
was
its
primary
aim
and
he
did
not
want
the
league
to
consist
entirely
of
extremists
lest
it
should
be
thought
to
consist
entirely
of
cranks
especially
at
a
moment
when
intelligent
people
are
beginning
to
like
distributism
distributism
is
normal
the
other
approach
was
heralded
in
the
final
article
of
the
series
october
by
a
reference
to
the
excitement
over
the
buckfast
benedictines
who
had
just
built
their
abbey
church
with
their
own
hands
an
adventure
to
which
if
i
understand
it
as
completely
as
i
share
it
the
english
blood
will
never
be
entirely
cold
but
about
these
new
heroes
of
architecture
there
is
one
note
that
is
not
new
that
comes
from
a
very
ancient
tradition
of
psychology
and
morals
and
that
is
that
the
adventurer
has
a
right
to
his
adventure
and
the
amateur
has
a
right
to
his
hobby
or
rather
to
his
love
but
neither
has
any
right
to
a
general
judgment
of
coldness
or
contempt
for
those
whose
hobby
is
human
living
and
whose
chief
adventures
are
at
home
you
will
never
hear
the
builders
of
buckfast
shouting
aloud
down
with
downside
for
it
was
designed
by
a
careful
gothic
architect
you
will
never
hear
them
say
how
contemptible
are
these
catholics
who
pray
in
common
churches
tawdry
with
waxwork
imagery
and
repository
art
of
the
great
adventurers
who
advance
out
of
the
christian
past
in
search
of
christian
future
you
could
never
say
that
the
pioneers
despise
the
army
what
seemed
to
chesterton
the
oddest
feature
in
the
opposition
to
his
idea
of
sanity
was
the
apparent
assumption
that
he
was
offering
an
impossible
ideal
to
a
world
that
was
already
working
quite
well
with
bland
disregard
of
the
breakdown
of
their
own
system
the
orthodox
economists
were
challenging
him
to
establish
the
flawlessness
of
his
they
laughed
at
the
distributist
desire
if
not
to
abolish
at
least
to
limit
machinery
they
adjured
him
to
be
more
practical
chesterton
had
replied
in
an
earlier
article
there
may
be
and
we
ourselves
believe
there
are
a
certain
number
of
things
that
had
better
be
always
done
by
machinery
machinery
is
now
being
used
to
produce
numberless
things
that
nobody
needs
machinery
is
being
used
to
produce
more
machinery
to
be
used
merely
for
the
production
of
things
that
nobody
needs
machinery
is
being
used
to
produce
very
badly
things
that
everybody
wants
produced
very
well
machinery
is
being
used
for
enormously
expensive
transport
of
things
that
might
just
as
well
be
used
where
they
are
machinery
is
being
used
to
take
things
thousands
of
miles
in
order
to
sell
them
and
bring
them
back
again
because
they
are
not
sold
machinery
is
being
used
to
produce
ornament
that
nobody
ever
looks
at
and
architecture
that
nobody
wants
to
look
at
machinery
is
taking
suicides
to
monte
carlo
and
coals
to
newcastle
and
all
normal
human
purpose
and
intelligence
to
bedlam
and
our
critics
gaze
at
it
reverently
and
ask
us
how
we
expect
ever
to
be
so
practical
as
that
june
this
desperate
situation
must
be
met
by
strengthening
the
home
the
small
workshop
the
english
peasantry
but
first
the
ground
might
have
to
be
cleared
one
phrase
used
in
his
articles
the
catastrophic
simplification
of
the
social
scene
reminds
us
once
more
how
keenly
aware
gilbert
was
of
something
that
had
not
yet
happened
the
present
war
with
its
of
the
social
order
in
the
article
from
which
i
have
been
quoting
he
compares
the
urgency
of
the
hour
to
the
period
of
the
french
revolution
in
his
of
seven
years
earlier
he
had
stressed
the
distributist
ideal
as
the
last
chance
to
do
deliberately
and
well
what
nemesis
will
do
wastefully
and
without
pity
whether
we
can
not
build
a
bridge
from
these
slippery
downward
slopes
to
freer
and
firmer
land
beyond
without
consenting
yet
that
our
most
noble
nation
must
descend
into
that
valley
of
humiliation
in
which
nations
disappear
from
history
of
p
in
this
book
which
he
had
tried
in
vain
he
tells
us
to
make
a
grammar
of
distributism
he
touches
on
the
enormous
changes
that
had
made
such
a
grammar
of
far
greater
urgency
when
was
issued
or
even
eighteen
years
later
when
wrote
wrong
with
the
individualist
competition
had
not
yet
given
place
to
the
trust
combine
or
merger
the
american
trust
is
not
private
enterprise
it
would
be
truer
to
call
the
spanish
inquisition
private
judgment
the
decline
of
trade
had
hardly
begun
at
the
turn
of
the
century
liberty
was
still
fairly
widespread
but
today
we
had
lost
liberty
as
well
as
property
and
were
living
under
the
worst
features
of
a
socialist
state
i
am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
cure
for
centralisation
is
decentralisation
both
in
the
book
and
in
the
paper
he
urged
constantly
a
double
line
of
escape
towards
the
restoration
of
freedom
initiative
property
and
the
free
family
the
one
line
was
the
comparatively
negative
one
of
winning
such
concessions
from
the
state
as
would
make
action
possible
the
other
was
personal
action
to
be
taken
without
any
state
aid
or
even
encouragement
the
germ
of
recovery
lay
in
human
nature
if
you
get
poison
out
of
a
man
system
the
time
will
come
when
he
himself
will
think
he
would
like
a
little
ordinary
food
if
things
even
begin
to
be
released
they
will
begin
to
recover
to
the
question
did
chesterton
believe
distributism
would
save
england
he
answered
no
i
think
englishmen
will
save
england
if
they
begin
to
have
half
a
chance
i
am
therefore
in
this
sense
hopeful
i
believe
that
the
breakdown
has
been
a
breakdown
of
machinery
and
not
of
men
a
most
difficult
question
to
answer
is
the
degree
of
the
success
its
stated
aim
was
propaganda
the
spreading
of
ideas
there
is
a
danger
that
the
tendency
to
regard
talking
as
negligible
may
invade
our
little
movement
our
main
business
is
to
talk
one
sees
the
point
of
course
yet
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
majority
of
leaguers
had
done
some
bit
of
constructive
work
towards
a
distributist
world
and
sweated
out
of
their
system
the
irritability
that
found
vent
in
some
of
their
quarrels
after
all
the
fight
for
freedom
as
far
as
it
concerned
attacking
government
was
carried
on
week
by
week
by
the
small
group
running
the
paper
the
main
body
of
distributists
would
have
learnt
their
own
principles
better
by
trying
to
act
them
and
been
far
more
effective
in
conveying
them
to
others
some
members
saw
the
need
of
individual
action
father
vincent
set
out
in
one
number
of
the
paper
fifteen
things
that
men
could
do
for
themselves
as
a
step
to
the
practice
of
a
distributist
philosophy
father
vincent
indeed
must
be
put
beside
chesterton
and
belloc
as
a
really
great
distributist
writer
useful
books
were
written
too
by
heseltine
and
blyton
who
both
also
set
to
work
to
grow
their
own
food
blyton
is
still
writing
and
still
growing
food
a
workshop
was
started
at
glasgow
probably
the
most
active
of
the
branches
father
vincent
came
to
a
league
meeting
clad
in
and
garments
blyton
urged
the
example
of
what
had
been
done
by
the
society
of
friends
in
creating
real
wealth
in
the
hands
of
the
poor
by
their
allotment
schemes
a
weakness
was
visible
i
think
in
the
very
different
and
contemptuous
treatment
of
ford
effort
to
promote
farming
among
his
workers
during
the
depression
because
it
was
made
by
ford
who
was
certainly
no
distributist
but
the
most
inspiring
article
in
the
paper
in
many
a
year
was
written
by
a
man
who
having
tried
in
vain
to
get
his
writings
printed
decided
to
start
practising
distributism
he
had
pondered
long
he
says
on
how
the
rank
and
file
of
the
movement
who
were
neither
writers
nor
speakers
should
help
and
the
answer
came
to
him
do
it
yourself
after
a
fascinating
description
of
how
he
built
the
nucleus
of
a
dwelling
house
against
the
time
that
a
small
plot
of
land
could
be
secured
he
ends
by
responsible
work
a
man
can
best
realise
the
dignity
of
his
human
personality
but
most
of
us
are
caught
in
the
net
of
industry
and
the
best
way
out
would
seem
to
be
to
create
that
is
to
employ
leisure
in
conscious
creative
effort
this
usually
means
the
use
of
hand
as
well
as
head
and
the
concentration
on
some
familiar
craft
the
aim
also
should
be
to
acquire
ownership
in
a
small
way
that
is
to
acquire
the
means
of
production
if
we
are
not
at
all
events
partly
independent
how
is
it
possible
to
urge
on
others
the
principles
of
small
ownership
in
saying
this
he
spoke
from
experience
for
he
had
found
that
before
he
began
his
experiment
his
friends
were
exasperated
by
references
to
the
principles
of
distributism
while
the
sight
of
the
building
in
progress
began
to
convert
them
i
have
found
many
letters
striking
the
note
of
gratitude
to
gilbert
for
his
goodness
and
the
inspiration
he
has
given
one
of
these
written
by
a
sailor
from
is
pure
distributism
your
articles
are
so
interesting
tho
so
hard
to
understand
why
not
come
down
a
bit
and
educate
the
working
class
who
are
always
in
trouble
because
they
do
know
what
they
want
you
see
sir
your
use
of
words
and
phrases
are
so
complicated
personally
that
why
i
so
fascinated
when
i
read
them
but
really
us
average
council
school
educated
people
ca
learn
from
you
as
we
should
but
what
i
do
understand
helps
me
to
live
the
sailor
goes
on
to
tell
the
story
of
his
life
a
workhouse
child
a
farm
boy
a
seaman
on
a
submarine
who
spent
his
danger
money
on
a
bit
of
land
in
cornwall
married
now
and
with
two
boys
what
a
thrill
of
pleasure
we
have
when
we
gaze
over
our
land
to
be
reared
in
a
workhouse
and
then
to
leave
a
freehold
home
and
land
to
children
may
not
seem
much
to
most
people
but
still
out
of
that
my
sons
can
build
again
i
feel
you
understand
this
letter
what
is
in
my
heart
and
i
want
to
thank
you
very
much
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
towards
the
end
of
september
the
league
held
a
meeting
to
which
gilbert
came
as
peacemaker
in
the
course
of
his
speech
he
remarked
that
he
had
often
said
harsh
things
of
america
in
the
days
of
her
prosperity
but
that
in
these
days
of
adversity
we
might
learn
much
from
that
country
he
instanced
the
saying
he
had
heard
from
a
business
man
on
his
recent
visit
there
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
back
to
the
farm
and
noted
the
fact
that
america
still
had
this
large
element
of
family
farms
as
a
basis
for
recovery
the
suggestion
that
distributists
wanted
to
turn
everybody
into
peasants
had
been
another
point
answered
in
what
we
offer
is
proportion
we
wish
to
correct
the
proportions
of
the
modern
state
a
considerable
return
to
the
family
farm
would
greatly
improve
this
proportion
of
p
but
if
he
had
spoken
harshly
of
the
united
states
it
was
nothing
to
the
way
he
had
talked
of
the
british
empire
although
at
moments
he
saw
in
imagination
the
romance
of
the
fact
that
england
had
acquired
an
empire
absentmindedly
through
englishmen
with
the
solitary
spirit
of
adventure
and
discovery
yet
he
had
an
unfortunate
habit
of
abusing
the
dominions
they
were
the
suburbs
of
england
a
curious
phrase
from
the
man
who
found
suburbs
intoxicating
we
could
not
learn
from
them
as
we
could
from
europe
for
they
were
inferior
to
us
these
and
many
other
hard
things
he
would
throw
out
again
and
again
in
his
articles
one
letter
in
the
reproached
him
from
a
new
zealander
of
english
descent
it
asked
him
whether
he
really
meant
that
those
of
his
own
race
were
so
utterly
indifferent
to
him
whether
he
really
preferred
bohemians
and
norwegians
to
britons
the
letter
received
no
answer
my
husband
and
i
used
to
wonder
with
secret
smiles
whether
he
was
the
australian
from
whom
gilbert
derived
the
idea
of
that
country
as
a
raw
and
remote
colony
belloc
also
in
a
letter
extolling
the
faith
asked
what
else
would
print
civilised
stuff
in
australasia
many
years
earlier
gilbert
had
written
in
reviewing
a
book
on
the
cottages
of
england
of
the
inconsistency
of
the
english
upper
classes
who
exalt
the
achievement
of
the
national
character
in
creating
the
empire
and
disparage
it
concerning
the
possibility
of
the
rural
life
of
england
their
creed
contains
two
great
articles
first
that
the
common
englishman
can
get
on
anywhere
and
second
that
the
common
englishman
can
not
get
on
in
england
surely
chesterton
had
this
same
inconsistency
as
it
were
in
reverse
the
common
englishman
was
great
in
england
the
common
irishman
was
great
in
ireland
the
common
scot
was
a
figure
of
romance
in
scotland
but
when
these
common
men
created
a
new
country
that
new
country
became
contemptible
the
empire
took
a
magnificent
revenge
for
it
was
in
the
suburbs
of
england
that
distributism
was
first
taken
seriously
and
used
as
practical
politics
a
far
more
effectively
distributist
paper
than
appeared
in
ceylon
under
the
able
editorship
of
de
fonseka
in
which
action
was
recorded
and
the
movements
of
government
watched
and
sometimes
affected
from
the
distributist
angle
and
catholic
social
thinking
formed
on
distributist
lines
this
paper
has
a
considerable
effect
also
in
india
but
of
course
the
main
distributist
impact
has
been
felt
in
the
states
in
canada
and
in
australia
there
is
a
difficulty
in
talking
about
the
influence
of
anyone
on
his
times
on
the
one
hand
as
mgr
knox
pointed
out
all
our
generation
has
grown
up
under
chesterton
influence
so
completely
that
we
do
not
even
know
when
we
are
thinking
chesterton
one
sees
unacknowledged
and
unconscious
quotations
from
him
in
books
and
articles
one
hears
them
in
speeches
and
sermons
on
the
other
hand
into
the
making
of
a
movement
there
flow
so
many
streams
that
it
is
possible
to
claim
too
much
for
a
single
influence
however
powerful
an
american
distributist
said
to
me
lately
that
the
movement
set
on
foot
by
chesterton
had
reached
incredible
proportions
for
one
generation
i
think
this
is
true
but
we
have
also
to
render
thanks
for
example
to
the
suicide
of
the
which
created
the
void
for
our
philosophy
that
the
distributist
league
has
had
much
influence
i
doubt
in
the
united
states
the
chesterton
spirit
is
better
represented
by
that
admirable
paper
than
by
the
american
distributists
for
is
offering
us
precisely
what
the
league
has
for
the
most
part
failed
to
offer
the
laboratory
test
of
the
distributist
ideal
every
number
carries
stories
of
men
who
have
in
or
farming
in
small
shops
in
backyard
industries
tried
out
distributism
and
can
tell
us
how
it
has
worked
and
to
work
its
editors
herbert
agar
ralph
borsodi
canon
ligutti
and
others
all
foremost
in
the
ruralist
movement
acknowledge
debt
to
chesterton
and
are
carrying
on
the
torch
monsignor
ligutti
own
work
in
the
field
of
farming
his
own
periodical
and
the
thoughts
that
inspire
the
catholic
rural
life
movement
of
america
are
among
the
most
important
manifestations
of
that
universal
religious
and
rural
awakening
for
which
chesterton
worked
so
hard
and
longed
so
ardently
in
canada
the
antigonish
movement
has
shown
a
happy
blending
of
theory
and
practise
for
the
university
itself
has
in
its
extension
movement
and
by
its
organ
maritime
provided
the
theory
while
up
and
down
the
country
groups
have
built
their
own
houses
and
canneries
started
their
own
stores
and
savings
banks
and
made
the
maritime
provinces
a
hopeful
and
community
of
small
farmers
and
fisher
folk
several
important
books
have
grown
out
of
this
movement
and
at
its
basis
lies
the
insistence
on
adult
education
which
shall
make
ordinary
men
masters
of
their
destiny
surely
it
is
the
authentic
voice
of
chesterton
when
tompkins
says
trust
the
little
fellow
or
coady
declares
the
people
are
great
and
powerful
and
can
do
everything
in
australia
distributism
has
given
a
fresh
slant
to
both
labour
and
catholic
leadership
the
direct
debt
to
chesterton
of
the
catholic
is
immense
and
while
the
paper
also
owes
much
to
catholic
of
america
and
to
the
jocistes
of
france
and
belgium
we
find
too
that
in
america
france
and
belgium
chesterton
himself
is
studied
more
than
any
other
catholic
englishman
the
campion
society
founded
in
melbourne
in
the
catholic
guild
of
social
studies
in
adelaide
the
aquinas
society
in
brisbane
the
chesterton
club
in
perth
and
the
campion
society
in
sydney
have
all
based
their
thinking
and
their
action
on
the
chesterbelloc
philosophy
these
groups
have
closely
analysed
belloc
and
of
and
have
applied
its
principles
in
their
social
action
in
a
most
interesting
fashion
thus
they
opposed
and
helped
to
defeat
a
scheme
for
compulsory
national
insurance
chiefly
on
the
ground
that
the
social
services
in
a
modern
state
were
the
insurance
premiums
which
capitalism
paid
on
its
life
policy
with
wages
high
enough
to
keep
families
in
reasonable
comfort
and
save
a
little
with
well
distributed
property
national
insurance
would
be
rendered
unnecessary
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
supported
and
won
national
child
endowment
because
although
fundamentally
only
a
palliative
this
at
least
strengthened
the
family
by
supplementing
wages
and
helping
parents
towards
ownership
and
property
most
important
however
of
all
the
australian
developments
has
been
the
approval
of
the
main
distributist
ideal
by
the
australasian
hierarchy
as
the
aim
of
catholic
social
action
this
was
especially
set
out
in
their
statement
on
social
justice
issued
on
occasion
of
the
first
social
justice
sunday
in
the
hierarchy
of
new
zealand
joined
with
that
of
australia
in
establishing
this
celebration
for
the
third
sunday
after
easter
indeed
the
social
policy
of
australian
catholicism
has
produced
the
slogan
property
for
the
people
while
the
policy
has
been
brought
into
action
both
by
many
scattered
individuals
in
that
huge
but
thinly
populated
country
and
in
organised
fashion
by
the
rural
life
movements
with
their
own
organs
of
expression
published
by
the
australian
if
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
the
impact
of
mind
upon
mind
it
becomes
bewilderingly
impossible
to
weigh
in
such
a
movement
as
distributism
the
actual
practical
effects
partly
because
while
distributism
leads
naturally
to
an
individual
says
chesterton
is
only
the
latin
word
for
an
atom
and
to
reduce
society
to
individuals
is
to
smash
it
to
atoms
still
the
movement
is
essentially
local
the
groups
usually
small
for
my
own
part
i
have
travelled
a
good
deal
always
with
a
primary
interest
in
social
developments
and
everywhere
i
have
found
chesterton
or
his
derivatives
the
numbers
in
america
alone
both
in
the
states
and
canada
who
are
trying
out
these
ideas
in
big
and
small
communities
is
amazing
i
did
begin
to
make
a
list
of
vital
movements
beginning
with
the
jocistes
and
the
american
catholic
worker
roving
over
the
world
and
trying
to
estimate
in
each
movement
i
had
met
the
proportion
of
chesterton
influence
and
again
the
extent
to
which
one
movement
is
in
debt
to
another
but
i
gave
it
up
in
despair
one
can
only
say
that
certainly
there
has
been
a
great
stirring
of
the
waters
in
every
country
each
has
taken
and
has
given
to
the
other
and
most
of
those
thus
have
been
the
little
men
whom
loved
and
in
whom
tompkins
tells
us
to
trust
to
utter
nobly
the
thoughts
of
that
little
man
was
chesterton
held
the
highest
aim
that
poet
or
prophet
could
set
before
him
distributism
is
that
little
man
philosophy
chesterton
gave
it
large
utterance
and
he
could
do
it
the
more
richly
because
as
he
said
many
years
ago
of
the
religious
philosophy
that
was
the
basis
of
his
social
outlook
i
did
not
make
it
god
and
humanity
made
it
and
it
made
me
meanwhile
he
himself
distributed
royally
he
gave
help
to
the
catholic
land
movement
to
cecil
houses
to
all
who
asked
him
for
help
he
educated
several
nieces
and
nephews
of
frances
and
gave
money
or
lent
it
in
considerable
sums
to
old
friends
in
difficulties
if
some
event
perhaps
judgment
day
should
call
together
all
those
helped
financially
by
gilbert
and
frances
i
think
they
will
be
surprised
to
meet
one
another
and
to
discover
what
a
lot
of
them
there
are
they
gave
too
to
the
catholic
church
at
beaconsfield
which
later
became
gilbert
monument
and
to
which
top
meadow
was
left
after
frances
death
but
even
top
meadow
was
distributed
a
small
piece
being
cut
off
the
garden
and
left
to
dorothy
collins
and
i
think
even
in
a
distributist
heaven
it
must
add
to
happiness
to
see
the
seventeen
rabbits
the
chickens
and
the
beehives
to
say
nothing
of
the
huge
quantities
of
vegetables
produced
on
this
fragment
of
his
property
for
this
war
like
the
last
with
all
its
suffering
will
if
the
bureaucracy
permit
it
again
energise
the
people
of
england
into
that
creative
action
which
is
the
only
soil
for
the
seed
of
distributism
it
began
by
distributing
the
people
and
london
was
no
place
for
a
distributist
movement
it
is
no
chance
that
the
growth
of
this
philosophy
is
among
small
groups
and
in
the
countryside
on
the
land
as
father
vincent
often
says
you
need
not
waste
a
moment
of
time
or
a
scrap
of
material
this
is
the
fierce
and
pious
thrift
that
gilbert
saw
in
his
youth
as
so
poetical
and
in
his
age
as
a
part
of
the
philosophy
of
distributism
chapter
xxvii
silver
wedding
the
consideration
of
the
distributist
league
that
flowed
out
of
the
foundation
of
in
has
carried
us
some
years
ahead
of
our
story
back
then
to
when
frances
and
gilbert
had
been
married
years
one
of
the
things
taught
me
long
ago
when
i
first
visited
them
at
beaconsfield
was
that
it
was
properly
to
be
called
beckonsfield
that
it
was
not
named
for
disraeli
but
that
he
impertinently
had
chosen
to
be
named
for
it
gilbert
often
spelt
it
bekonsfield
to
impress
his
point
both
in
theory
and
practice
he
had
a
lot
of
local
patriotism
and
a
little
of
that
special
pride
taken
by
all
men
in
houses
built
by
themselves
but
most
of
his
pride
went
out
to
the
fact
that
his
home
was
intensely
english
he
quoted
a
lover
of
sussex
who
said
among
the
beech
trees
of
buckinghamshire
this
is
really
the
most
english
part
of
england
he
felt
it
no
accident
that
has
called
this
particular
stretch
of
england
the
home
counties
public
life
was
so
ugly
just
now
the
decay
of
patriotism
under
the
corroding
influence
of
an
evil
and
cowardly
sort
of
pacifism
was
hateful
to
him
but
england
still
remained
to
the
english
when
the
time
should
come
the
oaks
that
had
made
our
ships
could
still
fill
us
with
heroic
memories
of
nelson
dying
under
the
low
oaken
beams
or
collingwood
scattering
the
acorns
that
they
might
grow
into
battleships
yet
if
he
said
i
were
choosing
an
entirely
english
emblem
i
should
choose
the
beaconsfield
was
by
one
theory
named
from
the
beech
forests
that
surrounded
it
and
while
the
oaks
suggested
adventure
and
the
british
lion
the
beeches
suggest
rather
the
pigs
that
feed
upon
their
mast
and
villages
that
grow
up
in
the
hollows
and
slow
curves
of
the
hills
the
return
to
the
real
england
with
real
englishmen
would
be
a
return
to
the
which
still
make
this
town
like
a
home
at
least
they
did
until
recently
i
shall
probably
be
told
tomorrow
that
several
beech
forests
have
been
removed
to
enable
a
motorist
temporarily
deaf
and
blind
to
go
from
birmingham
to
brighton
it
is
at
top
meadow
whither
they
moved
in
that
i
always
see
frances
and
gilbert
in
a
memory
picture
they
were
to
live
there
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
life
there
was
the
quiet
background
for
all
the
vast
mental
activity
and
the
journeying
over
england
and
ireland
and
europe
and
america
that
marked
the
years
that
remained
the
house
began
simply
as
a
huge
room
or
studio
built
in
the
field
opposite
overroads
at
one
end
was
a
stage
which
became
the
dining
room
at
the
other
end
a
minute
study
for
gilbert
the
roof
was
high
with
great
beams
at
the
study
end
was
a
musicians
gallery
a
wide
open
fireplace
held
two
rushbottomed
seats
on
one
of
which
frances
sat
in
winter
they
were
the
only
warm
corners
but
gilbert
did
not
feel
the
cold
and
certainly
could
not
have
fitted
into
the
inglenook
opposite
the
fire
was
a
long
low
window
looking
into
the
prettiest
garden
where
francis
stood
guardian
and
preached
perpetually
to
the
birds
a
pool
held
water
lilies
and
the
flowers
that
surrounded
the
pool
and
the
house
were
also
cut
and
brought
indoors
in
great
quantities
frances
loved
to
have
them
in
glowing
masses
against
the
background
of
books
new
shelves
had
to
be
added
every
year
as
the
books
accumulated
big
as
the
room
was
the
wall
space
was
not
enough
and
one
large
bookcase
was
built
out
from
the
wall
near
the
fireplace
into
the
middle
of
the
room
as
in
a
public
library
it
looked
well
there
and
it
screened
one
from
the
bitterest
blasts
for
the
place
seemed
full
of
air
from
the
four
winds
of
heaven
the
rest
of
the
house
was
built
on
to
this
room
and
looked
tiny
beside
it
kitchen
and
servants
quarters
two
and
one
very
small
bedroom
a
minute
sitting
room
for
frances
where
she
kept
her
collection
of
tiny
things
toys
and
ornaments
mostly
less
than
an
inch
many
far
smaller
that
were
the
delight
of
children
she
had
not
gilbert
remarked
allowed
her
taste
to
guide
her
in
choosing
a
husband
a
mixture
of
gilbert
strong
and
weak
qualities
affected
his
dealings
with
his
dependents
i
am
not
sure
he
felt
certain
that
it
was
quite
right
that
he
should
have
a
gardener
anyhow
no
man
was
ever
paid
so
highly
and
allowed
to
idle
so
completely
as
was
the
gardener
i
remember
there
an
exceedingly
able
gardener
when
he
chose
to
work
to
such
trifles
as
the
disappearance
of
coal
or
tools
neither
gilbert
nor
frances
would
dream
of
adverting
and
they
were
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
a
hard
case
story
at
all
times
one
man
used
to
call
weekly
to
receive
ten
shillings
for
what
service
no
one
was
able
to
form
the
faintest
conception
should
he
fail
to
appear
gilbert
mailed
the
money
he
was
found
one
day
fighting
another
man
on
the
doorstep
for
daring
to
beg
from
chesterton
from
a
conventional
point
of
view
the
maids
were
inconceivably
casual
neither
gilbert
nor
frances
would
have
thought
it
right
to
insist
on
caps
or
indeed
on
any
sort
of
uniform
it
is
my
impression
that
i
have
been
waited
on
at
dinner
by
someone
garbed
in
a
skirt
a
sweater
and
a
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
and
the
parlor
maid
took
for
granted
her
own
presence
beside
frances
and
dorothy
collins
as
a
chief
mourner
at
gilbert
funeral
according
to
bernard
shaw
writing
of
dickens
marriage
between
a
genius
and
an
ordinary
or
normal
woman
could
not
succeed
the
gap
was
too
wide
dickens
had
thought
he
could
go
through
with
it
only
because
he
had
not
measured
the
gap
in
this
theory
as
in
so
much
else
gilbert
stood
violently
opposed
to
shaw
no
doubt
he
must
at
times
have
realised
that
there
was
an
intellectual
gap
between
himself
and
the
ordinary
man
or
woman
but
it
was
a
thing
utterly
unimportant
character
love
sanity
these
things
mattered
infinitely
more
and
he
more
than
once
depicts
the
genius
as
painfully
climbing
to
reach
the
ordinary
his
views
concerning
the
sexes
were
equally
at
variance
with
those
of
shaw
and
of
most
of
the
moderns
he
was
quite
frankly
the
man
and
frances
was
the
woman
they
both
agreed
that
there
is
one
side
of
life
that
belongs
to
man
the
side
of
endless
cigars
smoked
over
endless
discussions
about
the
universe
gilbert
in
wrong
with
the
tells
us
that
the
voice
in
which
the
working
woman
summons
her
husband
from
the
tavern
is
the
same
voice
as
that
of
the
hostess
who
leaving
the
men
in
the
dining
room
tells
her
husband
not
to
stay
too
long
over
the
cigars
of
this
voice
he
entirely
approved
so
long
as
it
did
not
ask
to
stay
on
in
the
dining
room
he
often
said
that
the
important
thing
for
a
country
was
that
the
men
should
be
manly
the
women
womanly
the
thing
he
hated
was
the
modern
hybrid
the
woman
who
the
male
side
of
life
no
one
he
had
said
in
a
letter
of
his
engagement
time
takes
such
a
fierce
pleasure
as
i
do
in
things
being
themselves
and
both
he
and
frances
found
amusement
in
that
eternal
equality
which
gilbert
saw
in
the
sexes
so
long
as
they
kept
their
eternal
separateness
if
everything
he
said
is
trying
to
be
red
some
things
are
redder
than
others
but
there
is
an
eternal
and
unalterable
equality
between
red
and
green
it
so
happens
that
in
the
matter
of
the
wives
of
great
men
he
had
something
to
say
more
than
once
he
longed
to
hear
the
point
of
view
of
cobbett
who
remains
in
the
background
of
his
life
in
a
sort
of
powerful
silence
he
combated
shaw
notion
that
the
young
poet
would
repudiate
domestic
toils
for
his
wife
rather
he
would
idealise
them
though
this
gilbert
admits
might
at
times
be
hard
on
the
wife
but
the
matter
is
best
expressed
in
the
love
scene
in
one
of
his
later
romances
of
the
long
bow
that
valley
had
a
quality
of
repose
with
a
stir
of
refreshment
as
if
the
west
wind
had
been
snared
in
it
and
tamed
into
a
summer
air
what
would
you
say
if
i
turned
the
world
upside
down
and
set
my
foot
upon
the
sun
and
the
moon
i
should
say
replied
joan
hardy
still
smiling
that
you
wanted
somebody
to
look
after
you
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
an
almost
abstracted
fashion
as
if
he
had
not
fully
understood
then
he
laughed
quite
suddenly
and
uncontrollably
like
a
man
who
has
seen
something
very
close
to
him
that
he
knows
he
is
a
fool
not
to
have
seen
before
so
a
man
will
fall
over
something
in
a
game
of
and
get
up
shaken
with
laughter
what
a
bump
your
mother
earth
gives
you
when
you
fall
out
of
an
aeroplane
he
said
what
a
thing
is
and
how
much
finer
really
than
the
poetry
of
pegasus
and
when
there
is
everything
else
as
well
that
makes
the
sky
clean
and
the
earth
kind
beauty
and
bravery
and
the
lifting
of
the
head
well
you
are
right
enough
joan
will
you
take
care
of
me
pp
frances
was
not
especially
interesting
intellectually
although
she
had
much
more
mind
than
joan
in
the
story
but
above
all
she
carried
with
her
a
quality
of
repose
with
a
stir
of
refreshment
will
you
take
care
of
me
neither
of
them
probably
had
measured
at
first
all
that
that
care
would
mean
only
bit
by
bit
would
the
full
degree
of
his
physical
dependence
as
we
have
seen
it
through
the
years
become
clear
to
her
the
strenuous
campaign
in
the
matter
of
appearances
begun
during
the
engagement
might
alter
in
direction
but
had
rather
to
be
intensified
in
degree
as
he
grew
older
shaving
bathing
even
dressing
were
daily
problems
to
him
heat
the
water
an
early
secretary
at
overroads
heard
frances
saying
to
the
cook
chesterton
is
going
to
have
a
bath
and
o
need
i
came
in
tones
of
deepest
depression
from
the
study
the
thought
of
that
vast
form
climbing
into
and
out
of
the
bathtub
does
make
one
realise
how
a
matter
of
easy
everyday
practice
to
the
normal
person
became
to
him
almost
a
heroic
venture
his
tie
his
boots
were
equally
a
problem
i
remember
his
appearing
once
at
breakfast
in
two
ties
and
claiming
when
i
noticed
it
that
it
proved
he
paid
too
much
not
too
little
attention
to
dress
doctors
dentists
oculists
were
all
needed
at
times
but
gilbert
would
never
discover
the
need
or
achieve
appointments
or
the
keeping
of
them
still
more
serious
was
the
question
of
how
the
two
were
to
live
and
to
do
all
the
acts
of
generosity
that
to
them
both
seemed
almost
more
necessary
than
their
own
living
hard
as
he
worked
dorothy
collins
has
told
me
that
when
she
came
to
them
in
this
year
they
had
almost
nothing
saved
it
may
be
remembered
that
gilbert
wrote
to
frances
during
their
engagement
that
his
only
quality
as
a
shopper
was
ability
to
get
rid
of
money
and
that
he
was
not
good
at
such
minor
observances
as
bringing
home
what
he
had
bought
or
even
remembering
what
it
was
through
boyhood
and
into
manhood
his
parents
as
we
have
seen
had
never
given
him
money
to
handle
and
he
certainly
never
learnt
to
handle
it
later
in
life
he
spent
money
like
water
belloc
told
me
realising
his
own
incapacity
he
arranged
fairly
early
to
have
frances
look
after
their
finances
bank
the
money
and
draw
checks
when
we
set
up
a
house
darling
he
had
said
i
think
you
will
have
to
do
the
shopping
all
he
handled
was
small
sums
by
way
of
pocket
money
very
playfully
regarded
by
both
father
writes
for
he
had
often
witnessed
the
joke
that
they
made
of
it
what
could
she
do
he
continues
when
gilbert
went
out
with
or
words
to
that
effect
and
came
back
invariably
without
a
copper
not
knowing
where
his
money
had
gone
at
a
hotel
in
warsaw
the
manager
entreated
him
not
to
bring
every
beggar
in
town
around
the
door
he
could
never
refuse
a
beggar
and
the
money
not
given
away
was
probably
dropped
in
the
street
or
in
a
shop
the
solution
they
hit
upon
was
that
of
accounts
at
the
shops
and
hotels
or
anything
that
could
not
simply
be
brought
home
by
frances
and
placed
by
his
side
father
wrote
to
dorothy
collins
of
the
loving
care
with
which
frances
anticipated
all
his
wishes
never
was
the
cigar
box
out
of
date
know
this
and
it
was
so
long
before
you
came
and
his
toddle
to
the
railway
hotel
for
port
or
a
quart
according
to
climatic
conditions
she
devised
and
built
the
studio
for
gilbert
to
play
at
and
play
in
it
used
to
be
crowded
at
receptions
as
on
the
night
when
gilbert
broke
his
arm
he
had
been
toying
with
the
tankard
that
evening
to
the
detriment
of
social
intercourse
but
not
much
i
thought
we
were
all
in
good
fettle
the
of
the
white
was
just
going
to
the
printers
that
was
never
penned
in
fleet
street
nor
everlasting
he
wrote
verbosely
there
in
the
office
at
beaconsfield
he
was
pulled
together
braced
the
studio
become
the
house
almost
certainly
cost
more
than
they
had
planned
building
always
does
but
the
two
great
drains
were
the
benefactions
and
the
paper
frances
signed
as
a
matter
of
course
every
check
gilbert
wanted
but
i
imagine
it
was
sometimes
with
a
little
sigh
that
she
wrote
the
checks
for
the
endless
telephones
telegrams
printers
bills
and
other
expenses
that
poured
out
to
support
a
paper
which
to
her
seemed
chiefly
a
drain
on
energies
that
could
not
but
diminish
his
creative
writing
in
the
six
years
he
paid
over
into
the
paper
were
the
worst
years
in
them
the
checks
she
had
to
sign
totalled
the
last
sentences
quoted
from
father
touch
on
the
deepest
perhaps
the
only
deep
problem
for
them
both
for
far
the
hardest
thing
was
the
struggle
against
the
real
danger
that
he
might
again
drink
too
much
as
he
had
before
the
illness
that
so
nearly
killed
him
in
this
struggle
was
rendered
especially
hard
by
two
elements
in
her
frances
wanted
always
to
give
gilbert
exactly
what
wanted
and
she
hated
to
admit
even
to
herself
anything
that
could
be
called
a
fault
in
him
she
saw
the
overwork
that
she
was
powerless
to
stop
she
could
not
but
be
aware
how
great
it
made
the
temptation
it
was
for
her
to
remember
the
old
illness
to
be
vigilant
without
worrying
him
to
help
him
against
himself
after
the
long
illness
pocock
had
advised
total
abstinence
for
some
years
largely
because
as
he
told
me
gilbert
unless
specially
warned
ate
and
drank
absentmindedly
anything
that
happened
to
be
there
he
observed
this
prohibition
faithfully
until
pocock
left
beaconsfield
in
bakewell
who
succeeded
him
advised
moderation
but
only
occasionally
found
it
necessary
to
order
total
abstention
it
was
the
amount
of
liquid
he
feared
rather
than
its
nature
when
he
forbade
wine
he
did
so
because
wine
increased
the
general
tendency
to
absorb
liquid
for
gilbert
was
always
unslakeably
thirsty
daily
he
drank
several
bottles
of
vichy
water
or
evian
also
of
claret
at
what
may
be
called
the
open
seasons
and
many
cups
of
tea
and
coffee
spirits
he
practically
never
touched
nor
such
heavier
wines
as
port
and
sherry
but
even
two
bottles
of
claret
or
burgundy
although
usually
appearing
to
brighten
his
intellect
might
well
be
a
serious
strain
on
the
digestion
of
a
man
who
overworked
the
mind
without
exercising
the
body
he
loved
to
sip
a
glass
of
wine
monsignor
writes
and
to
stroll
between
sips
in
and
out
of
his
study
brooding
and
jotting
and
then
the
dictation
was
ready
for
the
morning
dorothy
collins
once
kept
a
record
for
a
few
weeks
of
the
number
of
words
dictated
of
the
book
of
the
moment
usually
thirteen
to
fourteen
thousand
about
hours
weekly
exclusive
of
journalism
editing
and
lecturing
the
pressure
was
tremendous
and
increasing
nor
was
it
felt
by
gilbert
only
in
a
letter
to
maurice
baring
at
the
time
of
his
conversion
he
writes
for
deeper
reasons
than
i
could
ever
explain
my
mind
has
to
turn
especially
on
the
thought
of
my
wife
whose
life
has
been
in
many
ways
a
very
heroic
tragedy
and
to
whom
i
am
so
much
in
debt
of
honour
that
i
can
not
bear
to
leave
her
even
psychologically
if
it
be
possible
by
tact
and
sympathy
to
take
her
with
me
frances
would
indeed
have
been
amazed
to
find
herself
cast
for
such
a
part
her
life
had
held
two
tragic
events
gertrude
death
and
the
much
sadder
death
of
her
brother
believed
to
have
killed
himself
with
her
faith
and
her
profound
affections
such
an
end
had
stabbed
deep
yet
certainly
frances
did
not
view
herself
as
other
than
happy
in
fact
i
think
she
very
seldom
thought
about
herself
at
all
there
was
something
of
heroism
in
this
very
frances
never
had
good
health
and
for
some
years
had
suffered
from
arthritis
of
the
spine
yet
intimate
as
i
was
i
knew
this
only
after
her
death
my
husband
was
saying
lately
that
had
he
been
asked
to
choose
adjectives
to
describe
frances
he
would
have
chosen
cheerful
and
of
all
the
people
we
have
known
we
felt
she
was
one
of
the
closest
to
the
norm
of
sanity
and
mental
health
quite
an
achievement
for
a
woman
suffering
from
a
really
painful
complaint
yet
i
think
when
gilbert
used
the
strong
phrase
heroic
tragedy
he
saw
with
his
great
insight
that
his
frail
wife
beside
their
heavy
cross
of
childlessness
beside
the
burden
of
her
own
physical
and
spiritual
sufferings
was
carrying
the
weight
of
his
achievement
and
that
it
was
not
a
light
one
heroic
was
the
right
word
but
tragedy
the
wrong
for
this
life
given
to
her
keeping
ended
on
a
note
of
triumph
the
treatment
of
a
situation
of
this
kind
can
of
course
easily
be
made
unreal
in
the
sort
of
golden
glow
cast
by
the
imagination
on
fleet
street
with
its
taverns
and
its
drinks
next
morning
headache
is
always
omitted
but
even
the
finer
deeper
glow
of
the
domestic
hearth
has
its
ashy
moments
no
finite
beings
can
conduct
their
lives
with
complete
absence
of
errors
and
regrets
in
any
human
relationship
however
perfect
the
people
concerned
sometimes
bore
or
annoy
or
even
hurt
one
another
that
is
one
of
the
main
things
that
sends
catholics
week
by
week
or
month
by
month
to
the
confessional
which
brings
for
everyman
something
of
the
renewal
and
of
daily
joy
that
the
genius
gilbert
saw
when
he
wrote
in
this
story
the
hero
is
always
eloping
with
his
own
wife
and
marrying
her
again
flora
finching
it
was
not
ecstasy
it
was
comfort
is
a
common
enough
view
of
a
reasonably
successful
marriage
but
gilbert
wanted
to
keep
and
did
keep
the
flashes
of
ecstasy
when
he
wrote
he
had
been
married
eleven
years
and
he
used
a
thought
that
had
inspired
a
poem
to
frances
while
they
were
engaged
the
heroine
in
the
story
keeps
changing
her
second
name
but
the
name
is
always
a
colour
in
one
town
the
hero
runs
away
with
her
as
mary
grey
in
another
as
mary
green
thus
as
a
girl
gilbert
had
seen
frances
in
green
and
had
understood
why
green
trees
and
fields
are
beautiful
had
seen
her
in
grey
and
had
learnt
a
new
love
for
grey
winter
days
and
the
grey
robes
of
palmers
and
in
blue
then
saw
i
how
the
fashioner
splashed
reckless
blue
on
sky
and
sea
and
ere
was
good
enough
for
her
he
tried
it
on
eternity
when
they
came
back
from
jerusalem
gilbert
dedicated
to
frances
the
of
and
we
find
him
again
at
his
old
trick
seeing
as
her
throne
the
great
stones
of
the
mediaeval
walls
seeing
nature
as
her
background
with
all
apologies
to
the
cynics
i
am
afraid
that
the
judgment
of
the
biographer
upon
all
the
evidence
must
be
that
after
years
gilbert
not
only
loved
his
wife
tenderly
but
was
still
ardently
in
love
with
her
a
curious
prayer
of
his
youth
was
fulfilled
as
they
celebrated
this
year
their
silver
wedding
a
wan
new
garment
of
young
green
touched
as
you
turned
your
soft
brown
hair
and
in
me
surged
the
strangest
prayer
ever
in
lover
heart
hath
been
that
i
who
saw
your
youth
bright
page
a
rainbow
change
from
robe
to
robe
might
see
you
on
this
earthly
globe
crowned
with
the
silver
crown
of
age
your
dear
hair
powdered
in
strange
guise
your
dear
face
touched
with
colours
pale
and
gazing
through
the
mask
and
veil
the
mirth
of
your
immortal
eyes
the
last
masquerade
pp
four
years
earlier
frances
had
aided
gilbert
in
making
the
decision
for
which
she
was
not
yet
herself
ready
to
do
the
act
which
he
called
the
most
difficult
of
all
my
acts
of
freedom
and
indeed
much
of
that
freedom
of
full
manhood
he
owed
to
her
now
after
four
years
of
waiting
she
was
almost
ready
to
join
him
she
wrote
to
father
june
dear
padre
i
want
now
as
soon
as
i
can
see
a
few
days
clear
before
me
to
place
myself
under
instruction
to
enter
the
church
the
whole
position
is
full
of
difficulties
and
i
pray
you
padre
to
tell
me
the
first
step
to
take
i
want
my
instruction
to
be
here
i
want
to
be
the
talk
of
beaconsfield
and
for
people
to
say
i
only
followed
gilbert
it
is
true
and
i
had
a
hard
fight
not
to
let
my
love
for
him
lead
me
to
the
truth
i
knew
you
would
not
accept
me
for
such
motives
but
i
am
very
tired
and
very
worried
many
things
are
difficult
for
me
my
health
included
which
makes
strenuous
attention
a
bit
of
a
strain
i
know
you
understand
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
yours
affecly
frances
chesterton
between
this
letter
and
the
next
gilbert
and
frances
celebrated
their
silver
wedding
july
my
dear
padre
we
have
had
such
a
week
of
alarums
and
excitements
that
i
had
not
even
time
to
thank
you
for
the
spoons
they
are
just
what
i
like
and
incidentally
just
what
i
wanted
i
feel
so
hopeless
at
getting
out
of
this
net
of
responsibilities
in
which
i
am
at
present
enmeshed
and
to
find
time
for
instruction
i
feel
i
have
a
lot
to
learn
and
i
think
after
all
i
had
better
go
quietly
to
father
and
talk
to
him
gilbert
is
writing
to
you
himself
i
know
he
thinks
i
have
made
myself
rather
unhappy
about
things
and
he
is
so
involved
with
the
paper
i
pray
he
gives
it
up
we
have
not
been
able
to
talk
over
things
sensibly
please
be
very
patient
with
me
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
get
clear
my
nephew
peter
is
very
ill
and
i
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
my
poor
sister
the
parish
priest

gratefully
frances

undated
dear
padre
many
grateful
thanks
did
you
receive
your
copy
of
the
incredulity
of
father
brown
it
was
put
aside
for
you
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
was
sent
off
or
appropriated
by
somebody
else
i
have
written
to
father
walker
and
after
having
seen
him
and
had
a
talk
i
shall
know
what
i
ought
to
do
it
is
only
the
mass
of
work
the
paper
my
poor
peter
and
money
worries
that
keep
me
on
the
edge
from
morning
till
night
i
feel
the
paper
must
go
it
is
too
much
for
gilbert
days
work
always
and
consequently
too
much
for
me
who
have
to
attend
to
everything
else
trying
to
settle
an
dispute
has
nearly
brought
me
to
tears
you
will
understand
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
time
to
think
and
adjust
my
conclusions
yrs
affect
frances
chesterton
this
group
of
letters
is
for
frances
amazingly
unreserved
i
have
never
known
a
happier
catholic
than
she
was
once
the
shivering
on
the
bank
was
over
and
the
plunge
had
been
taken
one
would
say
she
had
been
in
the
church
all
her
life
this
was
indeed
a
year
of
fulfillment
the
year
of
the
completion
of
their
home
for
they
surprisingly
acquired
a
daughter
i
sometimes
wondered
why
frances
and
gilbert
had
never
adopted
a
child
they
lavished
much
love
on
nieces
nephews
and
godchildren
but
this
was
the
only
fulfillment
to
their
longing
until
almost
old
age
and
even
then
their
conscious
act
was
merely
that
of
engaging
a
secretary
they
had
had
many
secretaries
before
some
of
whom
came
with
a
quite
inadequate
training
they
learnt
on
gilbert
as
a
friend
once
put
it
it
was
difficult
too
for
the
secretaries
since
neither
gilbert
nor
frances
had
any
idea
of
hours
or
of
the
arrangement
of
work
it
was
quite
probable
that
gilbert
would
suddenly
want
to
dictate
late
in
the
evening
or
again
that
frances
would
ask
the
secretary
of
the
moment
to
run
into
the
village
for
the
fish
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
hence
rather
general
discomfort
gilbert
dictated
straight
to
the
typewriter
so
shorthand
was
not
needed
he
went
very
slowly
with
many
pauses
but
it
is
typical
of
this
period
that
no
carbons
were
kept
of
letters
sent
no
files
of
letters
received
in
came
dorothy
collins
not
only
did
she
bring
order
out
of
chaos
but
she
became
first
the
very
dear
friend
of
both
frances
and
gilbert
and
finally
all
that
their
own
daughter
could
have
been
i
remember
how
frances
talked
of
her
to
me
when
she
was
hoping
dorothy
would
become
a
catholic
which
she
did
some
years
later
and
again
when
she
herself
was
left
solitary
by
her
husband
death
and
how
i
felt
with
inward
thanksgiving
that
no
child
could
mean
more
to
her
mother
but
long
before
this
stage
was
reached
came
a
great
lightening
of
the
burden
of
living
no
longer
would
frances
cry
over
income
tax
returns
no
longer
would
money
worry
her
chauffeur
as
well
as
secretary
dorothy
drove
them
both
to
london
for
engagements
and
through
england
and
europe
on
holidays
or
lecture
tours
she
went
with
them
to
america
and
handled
the
business
of
their
second
tour
there
now
when
friends
rang
up
to
make
arrangements
frances
or
gilbert
could
say
would
you
ring
again
when
dorothy
comes
in
not
quite
sure
she
keeps
the
engagement
book
and
while
dorothy
sternly
warded
off
the
undesirables
it
worked
out
much
better
for
friends
as
no
engagement
book
had
been
kept
before
with
any
regularity
now
engagements
were
kept
as
well
as
an
engagement
book
frances
would
still
deal
with
the
clothing
question
but
dorothy
handled
it
if
she
were
unwell
and
in
every
case
delivered
him
punctually
and
brought
him
home
again
a
few
of
the
lectures
and
debates
of
these
years
were
is
journalism
justifiable
an
aspect
of
francis
of
assisi
the
problem
of
liberty
is
the
house
of

any
use
what
poland
is

and
the
coming
peril
progress
and
old
books
americanization
the
modern
novel
if
i
were
a
dictator
the
excitement
of
catholics
everywhere
had
been
intense
when
gilbert
came
into
the
church
in
england
it
was
almost
as
great
over
frances
her
real
wish
to
remain
in
the
background
her
dislike
of
publicity
were
seldom
believed
in
by
those
who
did
not
know
her
i
happened
to
be
present
at
a
conversation
between
the
proprietor
and
the
editor
of
a
catholic
paper
which
had
displayed
a
poster
all
over
london
announcing
her
conversion
one
of
them
had
heard
that
she
was
annoyed
and
for
a
moment
both
seemed
a
little
dashed
then
said
one
of
course
she
has
to
pretend
not
to
like
it
and
this
was
at
once
accepted
by
the
other
for
both
took
for
granted
that
such
publicity
could
in
reality
have
given
her
nothing
but
pleasure
it
was
difficult
at
first
for
either
frances
or
gilbert
to
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
in
their
new
environment
and
it
was
the
greatest
good
fortune
that
the
year
of
frances
reception
was
also
that
of
the
new
simplification
following
upon
dorothy
arrival
for
the
preceding
few
years
had
resembled
the
hectic
period
of
the
lionising
of
the
young
chesterton
of
requests
poured
in
for
lectures
for
articles
for
introductions
to
books
are
there
no
other
catholics
to
do
things
frances
asked
me
rather
plaintively
of
these
years
monsignor
knox
said
later
his
health
had
begun
to
decline
and
he
was
overworked
partly
through
our
fault
a
dip
into
the
post
bag
brings
up
some
letters
from
father
martindale
to
gilbert
and
frances
passing
on
various
requests
but
also
realising
the
difficulty
i
sympathize
with
all
desperately
busy
men
i
have
already
protected
him
by
advising
small
or
fussy
groups
not
to
invite
him
now
and
again
the
solitary
recollection
i
have
of
any
interest
gilbert
showed
in
a
review
of
his
books
is
the
remark
he
made
to
my
husband
when
father
martindale
had
said
of
queen
of
seven
francis
thompson
is
here
outpassed
gilbert
repeated
the
phrase
and
said
eagerly
he
would
say
it
unless
he
meant
it
would
he
who
has
himself
been
caricatured
talking
on
the
radio
typing
and
eating
at
the
same
time
as
different
from
as
possible
in
his
pale
slimness
and
almost
transparent
appearance
was
no
less
busy
over
a
thousand
activities
it
was
interesting
that
he
should
ask
gilbert
help
especially
in
that
cementing
of
catholics
throughout
the
empire
that
has
always
so
passionately
preoccupied
him
in
the
war
he
had
discovered
in
military
hospitals
the
ordinary
englishman
and
above
all
the
ordinary
australian
and
new
zealander
to
them
and
to
the
apostolate
of
the
sea
he
was
to
devote
primarily
all
his
later
life
writing
therefore
to
counsel
the
chestertons
as
to
which
catholic
works
should
have
precedence
we
find
him
wanting
an
article
for
a
new
zealand
paper
the
only
one
of
its
sort
in
and
you
may
say
that
it
affects
the
community
of
the
two
islands
an
autographed
book
for
a
hulking
devotee
of
yours
and
a
member
of
the
australia
rugger
team
i
think
eight
of
them
are
catholics
this
would
give
enormous
joy
to
him
and
would
be
known
in
no
time
throughout
australia
do
try
to
from
south
africa
he
wrote
to
frances
you
will
be
surprised
to
get
a
letter
from
me
from
a
nameless
place
miles
inland
from
the
nyanga
mountains
which
you
will
find
variously
spelt
westward
from
say
beira
on
the
african
east
coast
this
is
the
reason
recently
a
boy
in
a
kraal
here
was
found
cutting
pious
pictures
from
a
newspaper
that
he
had
somehow
got
hold
of
he
was
a
good
little
catholic
why
are
you
cutting
out
that
one
because
is
a
great
mukuru
in
the
catholic
church
mukuru
is
potentate
and
will
serve
from
joseph
right
along
to
the
pope
not
to
mention
the
little
flower
the
great
mukuru
in
this
case
was
yourself
so
there
i
hope
you
will
smile
with
pleasure
but
not
try
to
answer
as
please
god
i
sail
on
the
and
ought
to
be
back
in
london
in
early
a
good
deal
better
thank
god
please
remember
me
affectionately
to
gilbert
this
is
the
first
time
a
typemachine
has
clicked
just
here
its
accompaniment
in
an
otherwise
dead
silence
is
a
distant
gurgling
yodel
so
to
say
some
native
feeling
happy
in
the
brilliantly
hot
sunlight
which
all
the
same
can
not
make
the
thin
air
hot
i
sleep
when
possible
under
furs
with
the
occasional
insect
dropping
off
the
thatch
over
my
head
later
planning
a
meeting
for
the
apostolate
of
the
sea
at
hall
he
writes
to
gilbert
similarly
fr
mcnabb
must
be
given
his
head
and
i
have
told
him
he
shall
be
given
it
i
hope
to
be
purely
practical
and
possibly
a
little
sentimental
the
seaman
is
everywhere
yet
for
us
nowhere
he
carries
everywhere
his
child
heart
man
body
hungry
unfed
soul
unique
power
of
feeding
his
goodness
into
others
the
the
world
man
the
man
the
man
whose
life
is
made
up
of
storms
and
stars
the
most
secretive
and
the
most
man
of
any
now
will
do
all
the
clumsy
stuff
pull
it
all
up
into
the
air
he
has
no
privacy
and
is
more
lonely
than
anyone
he
has
water
and
god
and
must
find
christ
walking
over
the
waves
towards
him
and
no
ghost
father
vincent
mcnabb
who
was
to
be
given
his
head
at
this
meeting
was
not
a
new
friend
of
catholic
days
but
a
very
old
one
a
friendly
critic
of
my
manuscript
asks
whether
he
even
more
than
belloc
or
chesterton
does
not
merit
the
title
of
the
father
of
distributism
at
least
he
brings
into
the
movement
something
none
other
could
bring
he
bases
his
social
philosophy
closely
on
the
gospels
of
which
his
knowledge
is
almost
unique
and
his
articles
bear
such
titles
as
the
economics
of
bethlehem
or
big
scale
agriculture
and
the
gospels
hatred
of
machinery
has
combined
with
love
of
poverty
to
sunder
him
from
a
typewriter
and
these
articles
are
all
handwritten
in
most
exquisite
and
legible
script
his
letters
have
always
come
in
old
envelopes
turned
inside
out
he
walks
whenever
possible
and
wears
a
shabby
white
habit
and
broken
boots
both
frances
and
gilbert
loved
him
dearly
and
their
rare
meetings
were
red
letter
days
for
both
besides
the
link
of
distributism
the
two
men
were
united
in
caring
deeply
for
the
reawakened
interest
in
thomas
and
his
philosophy
the
benedictine
as
well
as
the
dominican
outlook
and
history
especially
appealed
to
gilbert
and
the
friendship
with
father
ignatius
rice
which
had
begun
almost
with
the
century
grew
steadily
he
assisted
as
we
have
seen
at
gilbert
reception
into
the
church
and
whenever
they
met
after
that
gilbert
would
remind
him
we
were
together
on
the
great
day
high
wycombe
was
the
chesterton
parish
until
largely
by
their
help
a
church
could
be
built
at
beaconsfield
at
first
this
church
was
served
by
father
walker
parish
priest
of
high
wycombe
it
was
he
who
had
prepared
gilbert
for
his
first
communion
and
he
has
sent
me
some
of
his
recollections
it
certainly
did
not
take
long
to
prepare
him
for
he
evidently
knew
as
much
as
i
could
tell
him
nevertheless
he
said
i
was
to
treat
him
as
i
would
any
child
whom
i
was
teaching
this
knowing
the
man
whom
i
was
instructing
for
i
had
at
the
time
carefully
waded
through
his
orthodoxy
twice
was
indeed
an
undertaking
of
magnitude
however
i
went
through
the
catechism
he
was
importunate
that
i
should
use
it
as
he
said
all
the
children
made
use
of
it
very
meticulously
explaining
all
the
details
to
which
he
lent
a
most
vigilant
and
unswerving
attention
for
instance
he
wanted
me
to
explain
the
reason
of
the
drop
of
water
being
put
into
the
wine
at
the
preparing
of
the
chalice
for
the
holy
sacrifice
father
walker
describes
gilbert
opening
a
bazaar
and
spending
lavishly
at
every
stall
afterwards
being
photographed
in
his
company
father
walker
himself
weighed
and
the
caption
was
giants
in
the
faith
on
his
departure
gilbert
presided
at
the
farewell
meeting
and
made
a
speech
which
says
father
walker
gave
me
no
end
of
delight
father
now
monsignor
smith
became
the
first
rector
of
beaconsfield
as
a
separate
parish
the
chestertons
loved
the
little
church
there
which
later
became
gilbert
memorial
and
to
which
among
other
things
they
gave
a
very
beautiful
statue
of
our
lady
but
when
it
had
first
been
dedicated
there
had
been
for
both
frances
and
gilbert
a
deep
disappointment
curiously
enough
neither
of
them
had
any
devotion
to
the
little
flower
who
was
chosen
as
patron
they
had
hoped
for
a
dedication
to
the
english
martyrs
later
gilbert
used
to
tell
dorothy
who
loved
thérèse
that
he
could
not
care
for
her
with
all
apologies
to
you
dorothy
he
did
not
go
often
to
confession
dorothy
says
but
when
he
did
go
you
could
hear
him
all
over
the
church
getting
up
in
the
morning
was
always
a
fearful
effort
to
him
and
starting
for
early
mass
he
would
say
to
her
what
but
religion
would
bring
us
to
such
an
evil
pass
meanwhile
the
books
went
on
in
appeared
outline
of
sanity
the
catholic
church
and
chiefly
concerned
with
his
own
mental
history
incredulity
of
father
and
queen
of
seven
in
for
the
first
time
his
scattered
poems
were
brought
into
the
volume
of
augustine
asks
whether
we
can
praise
god
before
we
know
him
gilbert
answered
that
question
when
by
praise
and
thanksgiving
he
came
as
a
boy
to
the
discovery
of
god
beginning
by
a
passionate
desire
to
thank
someone
for
the
universe
there
is
much
praise
in
the
collected
poems
there
is
the
note
of
hope
in
an
almost
hopeless
fight
in
ballad
of
the
white
there
are
lovely
poems
to
his
wife
since
browning
none
has
understood
the
sacrament
of
marriage
as
well
as
gilbert
chesterton
in
there
also
appeared
beside
a
couple
of
pamphlets
the
return
of
don
quixote
robert
louis
stevenson
the
secret
of
father
brown
the
judgment
of
johnson
louis
took
gilbert
back
to
his
boyhood
and
is
by
general
agreement
among
the
best
of
his
literary
studies
but
the
best
thing
he
ever
said
apropos
of
stevenson
came
not
in
this
book
but
in
his
attack
on
the
science
of
eugenics
keats
died
young
but
he
had
more
pleasure
in
a
minute
than
a
eugenist
gets
in
a
month
stevenson
had
lung
trouble
and
it
may
for
all
i
know
have
been
perceptible
to
the
eugenic
eye
even
a
generation
before
but
who
would
perform
that
illegal
operation
the
stopping
of
stevenson
intercepting
a
letter
bursting
with
good
news
confiscating
a
hamper
full
of
presents
and
prizes
pouring
torrents
of
intoxicating
wine
into
the
sea
all
this
is
a
faint
approximation
for
the
eugenic
inaction
of
the
ancestors
of
stevenson
this
however
is
not
the
essential
point
with
stevenson
it
is
not
merely
a
case
of
the
pleasure
we
get
but
of
the
pleasure
he
got
if
he
had
died
without
writing
a
line
he
would
have
had
more
joy
than
is
given
to
most
men
shall
i
say
of
him
to
whom
i
owe
so
much
let
the
day
perish
wherein
he
was
born
shall
i
pray
that
the
stars
of
the
twilight
thereof
be
dark
and
it
be
not
numbered
among
the
days
of
the
year
because
it
shut
not
up
the
days
of
his
mother
womb
i
respectfully
decline
like
job
i
will
put
my
hand
upon
my
mouth
and
other
evils
p
when
the
itself
appeared
sir
edmund
gosse
wrote
i
have
just
finished
reading
the
book
in
which
you
smite
the
detractors
of
hip
and
thigh
i
can
not
express
without
a
sort
of
hyperbole
the
sentiments
which
you
have
awakened
of
joy
of
satisfaction
of
relief
of
malicious
and
vindictive
pleasure
we
are
avenged
at
last
it
is
and
always
since
his
death
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
write
anything
which
went
below
the
surface
of
i
loved
him
and
still
love
him
too
tenderly
to
analyse
him
but
you
who
have
the
privilege
of
not
being
dazzled
by
having
known
him
have
taken
the
task
into
your
strong
competent
hands
you
could
not
have
done
it
better
the
latest
survivor
the
only
survivor
of
his
little
early
circle
of
intimate
friends
thanks
you
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
is
a
fantasia
about
the
future
in
which
the
study
of
heraldry
leads
to
the
discovery
of
england
and
the
centuries
of
her
happiness
and
of
her
faith
increasingly
gilbert
saw
the
only
future
for
his
country
in
a
between
those
divorced
three
hundred
years
ago
england
and
the
catholic
church
is
among
the
less
good
of
his
books
but
like
all
the
works
of
these
years
it
is
saturated
with
catholicism
i
wondered
whether
i
felt
more
admiration
or
amazement
when
a
man
once
asked
us
to
publish
a
book
on
chesterton
saying
i
am
an
atheist
myself
but
that
does
matter
as
i
do
deal
with
his
religion
as
a
young
man
gilbert
had
wanted
to
marry
the
religion
of
johnson
to
the
republicanism
of
wilkes
and
in
his
catholic
faith
of
today
he
saw
simply
the
rounding
out
and
the
completing
of
the
religion
of
johnson
judgment
of
his
play
about
that
great
man
was
like
an
immense
succès
but
not
a
stage
success
it
was
brilliantly
acted
and
appreciatively
criticised
but
could
not
win
a
public
bernard
shaw
was
still
constantly
urging
gilbert
towards
the
drama
belloc
too
believed
he
could
write
a
successful
play
and
he
and
anstey
author
of
suggested
the
dramatising
of
a
belloc
story
but
neither
the
scenario
they
jointly
sketched
for
belloc
nor
another
made
by
gilbert
alone
for
his
own
ever
reached
the
stage
i
remember
going
with
the
chestertons
to
a
of
a
father
brown
picture
two
of
the
stories
had
been
cleverly
combined
the
cast
was
first
rate
including
una
and
walter
connolly
and
i
came
out
feeling
convinced
that
father
brown
would
become
another
charlie
chan
the
stories
would
adapt
so
well
abounding
as
they
do
in
scenes
impossible
for
the
stage
but
perfectly
easy
for
the
screen
high
walls
windows
ladders
flying
harlequins
but
the
first
picture
failed
possibly
because
it
was
too
short
and
no
more
were
made
the
drama
remained
the
one
field
in
which
he
had
no
success
shaw
name
for
gilbert
and
belloc
the
chesterbelloc
had
come
by
the
public
to
be
used
for
the
novels
in
which
they
collaborated
belloc
wrote
the
story
chesterton
drew
the
pictures
and
the
resulting
product
was
known
as
the
chesterbelloc
a
number
of
letters
from
belloc
beg
gilbert
to
do
the
drawings
early
in
order
to
help
the
story
i
have
already
written
a
number
of
which
you
might
care
to
sketch
i
append
a
list
your
makes
all
the
difference
to
my
i
see
the
people
in
action
more
clearly
and
again
i
ca
write
till
i
have
the
inspiration
of
your
pencil
for
the
comedy
in
me
is
ailing
belloc
would
come
over
to
beaconsfield
for
a
day
or
a
night
and
the
two
men
retire
into
gilbert
minute
study
whence
hoots
of
laughter
would
be
heard
at
the
end
of
a
couple
of
hours
they
would
emerge
with
the
drawings
for
a
book
complete
indeed
several
more
than
were
needed
father
rice
asked
gilbert
once
what
he
was
writing
and
he
replied
my
publishers
have
demanded
a
fresh
batch
of
corpses
the
little
i
am
very
fond
said
one
reader
to
chesterton
of
that
officious
little
loafer
became
a
feature
in
crime
anthologies
and
when
anthony
berkeley
in
wanted
to
found
the
detective
club
he
wrote
that
it
would
be
quite
incomplete
without
the
creator
of
father
brown
gilbert
soon
became
president
needless
to
say
writes
dorothy
sayers
he
read
his
part
of
the
initiation
ceremony
with
tremendous
effect
and
enormous
gusto
in
an
article
gilbert
wrote
about
the
club
he
called
it
a
very
small
and
quiet
conspiracy
to
which
i
am
proud
to
belong
meeting
in
various
restaurants
its
members
would
discuss
various
plots
and
schemes
of
crime
some
results
of
these
discussions
may
be
seen
in
the
initiation
ceremonies
which
he
made
public
in
the
article
thereby
setting
a
good
example
to
the
mafia
the
ku
klux
klan
the
illuminati
and
all
the
other
secret
societies
which
now
conduct
the
greater
part
of
public
life
in
the
age
of
publicity
and
public
opinion
ruler
shall
say
to
the

is
it
your
firm
desire
to
become
a

of
the

shall
answer
in
a
loud
voice
that
is
my
desire
do
you
promise
that
your
detectives
shall
well
and
truly
detect
the
crimes
presented
to
them
using
those
wits
which
it
may
please
you
to
bestow
upon
them

nor

or

i
do
do
you
solemnly
swear
never
to
conceal
a
vital
clue
from
the

i
do
do
you
promise
to
observe
a
seemly
moderation
in
the
use
of
gangs
conspiracies
ghosts
hypnotism
chinamen
and
lunatics

utterly
and
for
ever
to
forswear

you
honour

i

the

there
anything
you

named
a

do
you

shall
name
the

which
the

has
declared
to
be
his
peculiar
to
observe
faithfully
all
these
promises
which
you
have
made
so
long
as
you
are
a
member
of
the
club
if
the
candidate
is
not
able
to
name
a
thing
which
he
holds
sacred
then
the
ruler
shall
propose
the
oath
in
this
manner
following
do
you
as
you
hope
to
increase
your
sales
swear
to
observe
faithfully
all
these
promises
which
you
have
made
so
long
as
you
are
a
member
of
the
club
a
book
called
floating
was
brought
out
by
the
club
chesterton
wrote
the
introduction
and
each
member
produced
one
chapter
reading
it
without
inside
knowledge
i
conceived
that
the
idea
was
for
each
to
clear
up
the
problems
created
by
his
predecessor
and
create
fresh
ones
for
his
successor
gilbert
tells
of
the
subtler
joke
underlying
the
story
perhaps
the
most
characteristic
thing
that
the
detection
club
ever
did
was
to
publish
a
detective
story
which
was
quite
a
good
detective
story
but
the
best
things
in
which
could
not
possibly
be
understood
by
anybody
except
the
gang
of
criminals
that
had
produced
it
it
was
called
floating
and
was
written
somewhat
uproariously
in
the
manner
of
one
of
those
paper
games
in
which
each
writer
in
turn
continues
a
story
of
which
he
knows
neither
head
nor
tail
it
turned
out
remarkably
readable
but
the
joke
of
it
will
never
be
discovered
by
the
ordinary
reader
for
the
truth
is
that
almost
every
chapter
thus
contributed
by
an
amateur
detective
is
a
satire
on
the
personal
peculiarities
of
the
last
amateur
detective
this
it
will
be
sternly
said
is
not
the
way
to
become
a
it
is
a
matter
of
taste
but
to
my
mind
there
is
always
a
curious
tingle
of
obscure
excitement
in
the
works
of
this
kind
which
have
remained
here
and
there
in
literary
history
the
sort
of
book
that
it
is
even
more
enjoyable
to
write
than
to
read
floating
was
a
fair
success
financially
we
hired
a
sort
of
garret
writes
monsignor
knox
with
the
proceeds
as
club
rooms
and
on
the
night
after
we
all
received
our
keys
the
premises
were
burglariously
entered
why
or
by
whom
is
still
a
mystery
but
it
was
a
good
joke
that
it
should
happen
to
the
detective
club
lord
peter
and
father
brown
and
monsieur
poirot
how
were
the
mighty
fallen
there
is
a
custom
in
both
english
and
scottish
universities
of
electing
a
lord
rector
with
the
accompaniment
of
much
undergraduate
ragging
of
the
choicest
kind
the
candidates
usually
each
represent
a
political
party
but
personal
popularity
has
much
to
say
in
their
success
at
the
scottish
universities
the
contests
are
particularly
spirited
and
his
keen
sense
of
fun
made
gilbert
ready
to
accept
frequent
invitations
to
stand
at
glasgow
in
austen

votes
chesterton
and
sidney

what
swamped
you
wrote
jack
phillimore
always
critical
of
the
gentler
sex
was
the
women
whose
simple
snobbery
can
not
get
past
the
top
hat
and
frock
coat
and
right
honourable
boyle
was
never
kidnapped
others
were
removed
into
the
mountains
the
last
sentence
might
have
been
lifted
from
sir
walter
it
refers
to
a
pleasing
habit
among
scots
undergraduates
of
kidnapping
the
supporters
of
their
opponents
and
keeping
them
safely
concealed
till
after
the
election
whether
or
not
it
was
through
their
simple
snobbery
as
professor
phillimore
said
it
was
certainly
the
women
vote
that
swamped
him
of
the
votes
by
which
austen
chamberlain
beat
chesterton
the
men
only
accounted
for
the
women
for
but
it
must
have
been
some
profounder
passion
that
caused
one
of
england
leading
women
novelists
to
write
to
the
secretary
of
the
glasgow
university
liberal
club
i
fail
to
see
why
you
should
desire
to
embarrass
liberalism
at
one
of
its
least
happy
moments
by
associating
it
with
that
village
idiot
on
a
large
scale
who
is
responsible
for
the
muddled
economics
and
disagreeable
fantastics
of
weekly
this
was
the
outlook
of
that
official
liberalism
which
had
long
made
it
so
difficult
for
gilbert
to
go
on
calling
himself
a
liberal
the
servile
state
was
in
full
swing
and
official
liberalism
asked
nothing
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
operate
it
whether
belloc
and
cecil
chesterton
had
been
right
or
wrong
at
an
earlier
date
in
seeing
the
political
parties
in
collusion
it
is
certain
that
by
now
an
utter
bankruptcy
in
statesmanship
had
reduced
them
all
to
saying
the
same
things
while
they
did
nothing
ten
years
later
on
the
day
of
the
last
general
election
of
his
life
gilbert
wrote
the
liberal
has
formed
the
opinion
that
peace
is
decidedly
preferable
to
its
alternative
of
war
and
that
this
should
be
achieved
through
support
of
the
league
of
nations
interfering
with
the
ambitions
of
other
nations
the
ministerialist
on
the
other
hand
holds
that
we
should
if
possible
employ
a
machinery
called
the
league
of
nations
with
the
object
of
securing
peace
to
which
he
is
much
attached
the
ministerialist
demands
that
strong
action
should
be
taken
to
reduce
unemployment
but
the
liberal
does
not
scruple
to
retort
that
unemployment
is
an
evil
against
which
strong
action
must
be
taken
the
liberal
thinks
that
we
ought
to
revive
our
trade
thus
thwarting
and
throwing
himself
across
the
path
of
the
national
tory
who
still
insists
that
our
trade
should
be
revived
thus
the
two
frowning
cohorts
confront
each
other
and
i
hear
the
noise
of
battle
even
as
i
write
in
june
he
was
invited
to
stand
for
edinburgh
university
he
replied
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
me
if
there
has
been
any
delay
in
acknowledging
your
exceedingly
flattering
communication
i
have
been
away
from
home
and
moving
about
a
good
deal
and
have
only
just
returned
from
london
certainly
there
is
nothing
which
i
should
feel
as
so
great
an
honour
or
one
so
exciting
or
so
undeserved
as
to
receive
even
the
invitation
to
stand
for
such
a
position
in
the
great
university
that
has
already
been
so
generous
to
me
if
you
really
think
it
would
be
of
any
service
to
your
cause
i
can
hardly
refuse
such
a
compliment
of
course
you
understand
that
it
is
only
in
a
rather
independent
sense
though
as
i
think
in
the
right
sense
that
i
shall
always
call
myself
a
liberal
indeed
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
any
real
sort
of
liberal
who
is
not
really
an
independent
liberal
i
am
quite
certain
i
am
not
a
tory
or
a
socialist
he
was

election

under
the
surprise
attack
made
by
the
chestertonians
at

concert
at

and
are
preparing
reprisals
the
following
letter
is
reply
to
the
first
proposal
from
the
aberdeen
students
october
i
can
at
least
assure
you
that
the
delay
in
acknowledging
properly
the
most
flattering
compliment
which
you
have
paid
me
was
not
due
to
any
notion
of
neglecting
it
it
was
due
to
the
practical
necessity
at
the
moment
of
discovering
and
deciding
on
a
fact
which
may
for
all
i
know
save
you
the
trouble
of
further
consideration
of
the
matter
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
mention
the
practical
difficulty
first
i
now
find
that
i
shall
almost
certainly
be
obliged
to
be
out
of
england
and
scotland
for
about
three
or
four
months
or
conceivably
a
little
more
beginning
about
the
middle
of
january
i
do
not
know
what
preliminary
formalities
would
be
demanded
of
me
as
a
candidate
or
when
the
demand
for
them
would
arise
but
i
was
so
strongly
impressed
with
the
honour
you
have
paid
me
that
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
find
out
the
facts
on
this
particular
point
so
that
you
might
act
on
it
in
any
way
you
think
right
in
any
case
if
the
delay
thus
involved
has
placed
you
in
any
difficulty
i
need
not
say
that
i
shall
fully
understand
your
finding
the
project
unworkable
and
i
shall
be
quite
content
to
remember
the
compliment
of
the
request
there
is
another
consideration
which
would
help
the
practical
side
of
the
case
and
for
that
i
fear
i
must
make
the
practical
enquiries
of
you
as
people
understanding
the
circumstances
you
do
not
mention
the
party
you
represent
and
though
i
am
like
most
of
us
long
past
attaching
a
horrid
sanctity
to
the
name
i
hope
you
will
forgive
that
much
curiosity
in
a
poor
bewildered
journalist
who
has
been
exhibited
in
many
lights
and
i
was
put
up
as
a
candidate
at
glasgow
as
a
liberal
which
is
really
quite
true
but
i
think
i
managed
in
my
election
pamphlet
to
give
my
own
definition
of
liberalism
i
have
also
more
recently
on
a
public
platform
in
glasgow
supported
my
friend
compton
mackenzie
when
he
stood
as
a
scottish
nationalist
both
these
positions
i
am
quite
prepared
to
defend
but
in
the
latter
you
might
naturally
prefer
a
nationalist
candidate
who
was
not
only
a
quarter
of
a
scotsman
i
may
remark
that
as
the
quarter
is
called
keith
and
comes
from
aberdeen
i
am
rather
thrilled
at
the
name
of
marischal
college
there
is
one
other
point
i
think
it
only
right
to
mention
for
your
sake
as
much
as
my
own
you
know
the
local
conditions
do
you
think
it
likely
that
we
should
be
left
with
one
and
a
half
votes
looking
a
little
ridiculous
because
the
miserable
quarter
of
a
scot
happens
to
have
the
same
religion
as
bruce
and
maxy
stuart
i
only
ask
for
information
which
you
alone
could
supply
but
it
may
be
that
the
considerations
i
have
already
mentioned
have
disposed
of
the
matter
believe
me
my
gratitude
is
none
the
less
gilbert
said
of
my
father
that
he
showed
an
embarrassing
respect
for
younger
men
surely
gilbert
own
tone
of
respect
must
here
have
embarrassed
even
undergraduates
the
uncertainty
of
success
or
failure
only
troubled
him
as
it
might
affect
his
supporters
the
sporting
element
in
the
contest
appealed
to
his
undying
boyishness
perhaps
this
chapter
may
find
its
best
conclusion
in
the
vivid
memories
written
down
in
answer
to
my
request
of
one
of
younger
friends
douglas
woodruff
who
came
to
know
him
in
the
year
of
that
silver
wedding
which
meant
so
much
that
i
have
chosen
it
for
the
title
of
a
chapter
covering
much
of
chesterton
catholic
life
chesterton
devotes
a
long
passage
in
the
to
the
dinner
given
at
the
old
adelphi
terrace
hotel
to
belloc
on
his
sixtieth
birthday
in
july
i
remember
very
well
the
high
old
fashioned
car
the
chestertons
used
to
hire
in
beaconsfield
for
i
accompanied
him
with
particular
instructions
to
deliver
him
safely
and
on
time
as
was
very
necessary
for
he
was
in
the
chair
we
might
have
lost
him
for
we
went
first
to
the
times
office
where
i
was
then
working
as
i
had
proofs
to
correct
before
disappearing
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
he
was
seized
with
the
idea
that
it
would
be
very
good
fun
for
him
to
enter
printing
house
square
and
have
it
announced
that
it
was
chesterton
come
to
write
the
leaders
having
brought
the
thunder
with
him
under
his
cloak
quite
early
on
the
drive
up
he
began
speculating
about
who
would
be
at
the
party
and
when
he
had
suggested
various
figures
who
were
certainly
not
going
to
be
there
he
said
with
a
mixture
of
regret
and
acceptance
there
is
always
such
a
quality
about
belloc
quarrels
when
he
rose
to
propose
the
toast
he
said
at
once
that
if
he
or
anybody
else
in
the
room
was
remembered
at
all
in
the
future
it
would
be
because
they
had
been
associated
with
the
guest
of
the
evening
he
meant
that
the
evening
stood
out
in
his
memory
because
it
was
so
unlike
the
ordinary
sort
of
dinners
he
knew
where
he
was
a
principal
figure
it
delighted
him
that
without
any
programme
or
premeditation
all
the
thirty
diners
in
turn
made
speeches
in
the
main
parody
speeches
it
was
in
short
a
party
and
not
a
performance
in
the
decade
when
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
know
topmeadow
he
was
still
paying
the
price
of
a
literary
fame
which
he
had
sought
in
youth
because
it
meant
success
in
his
calling
and
an
income
but
which
became
a
barrier
he
was
always
meeting
and
breaking
through
many
literary
men
genuinely
enough
prefer
company
in
which
they
are
on
just
the
same
footing
as
everyone
else
to
company
in
which
they
are
little
kings
but
chesterton
was
exceptional
in
liking
to
live
in
the
fullest
equality
of
intercourse
not
only
with
all
sorts
of
men
but
with
the
lesser
practitioners
of
his
own
calling
he
sought
the
affection
and
not
the
admiration
of
his
fellow
men
or
more
precisely
he
sought
neither
what
he
sought
was
to
do
things
like
discovering
the
truth
in
their
company
no
man
more
naturally
distinguished
between
a
man
and
his
views
or
found
easier
the
theological
injunction
to
hate
the
sin
but
love
the
sinner
one
of
the
few
occasions
on
which
i
recall
him
as
rather
hurt
was
just
after
he
had
met
stanley
baldwin
at
taplow
and
had
not
been
welcomed
as
a
fellow
englishman
sharing
immense
things
like
the
love
of
the
english
country
or
english
letters
but
with
a
cold
correctitude
from
a
politician
who
seemed
chiefly
conscious
he
was
meeting
in
a
man
who
week
by
week
sought
to
bring
political
life
into
hatred
ridicule
and
contempt
he
was
not
made
by
nature
for
the
kind
of
journalistic
tradition
which
belloc
and
cecil
chesterton
established
and
his
loyal
affection
for
them
made
him
adopt
i
recall
him
expounding
to
the
lawyers
of
the
thomas
more
society
the
absurdity
of
the
legal
definition
of
libel
arguing
that
of
its
nature
free
discussion
meant
arousing
at
any
rate
ridicule
and
contempt
if
not
hatred
against
men
and
measures
of
which
you
disapproved
it
was
ridicule
that
he
preferred
to
arouse
the
lawyers
were
quite
unconvinced
as
they
generally
are
when
laymen
have
any
complaints
about
the
law
and
they
soon
realized
that
to
chesterton
the
whole
idea
of
involving
the
law
because
of
arguments
and
discussions
and
invective
was
hitting
below
the
belt
he
could
be
seen
at
his
happiest
in
the
mock
trials
which
were
held
every
summer
for
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
at
the
london
school
of
economics
for
the
king
edward
vii
hospital
fund
he
was
relied
upon
year
after
year
to
prosecute
one
year
it
was
leading
actors
and
actresses
another
year
sculptors
and
architects
another
year
politicians
another
headmasters
he
entered
completely
into
the
spirit
of
an
entertainment
which
combined
two
of
his
abiding
interests
public
debate
and
private
theatricals
that
was
a
setting
in
which
he
could
completely
exemplify
his
favourite
recipe
for
the
modern
world
that
it
should
be
approached
in
a
spirit
of
intellectual
ferocity
and
personal
amiability
but
what
marked
his
own
contributions
to
these
affairs
was
the
intellectual
ferocity
in
the
weight
and
content
of
his
criticism
most
of
the
eminent
men
who
consented
to
take
part
came
to
play
a
game
for
the
sake
of
the
hospitals
and
because
they
rarely
unbent
like
that
in
public
they
were
wholly
facetious
and
trivial
to
chesterton
there
was
no
difficulty
or
incongruity
in
combining
the
fun
of
acting
with
the
fun
of
genuine
intellectual
discussion
when
he
prosecuted
the
headmasters
of
leading
public
schools
for
destroying
freedom
of
thought
i
came
down
in
a
lift
with
them
afterwards
and
found
they
were
volubly
nettled
at
the
drastic
and
serious
case
he
had
made
inside
the
stage
setting
of
burlesque
and
seemed
to
think
he
had
not
been
playing
the
game
when
he
wrapped
up
so
much
meaning
in
his
speech
and
examinations
this
had
never
entered
his
head
it
had
come
perfectly
naturally
to
him
to
make
wholly
real
and
material
points
even
in
a
mock
trial
and
with
a
wealth
of
fun
but
he
liked
being
one
of
a
troupe
on
a
stage
very
much
more
than
being
a
lonely
and
eminent
figure
on
a
platform
because
to
him
the
great
attraction
of
discussion
was
that
it
should
be
a
joint
quest
a
mental
walk
with
an
object
in
view
but
also
with
an
eye
for
everything
that
might
and
would
turn
up
on
the
way
he
laughed
his
high
laugh
like
charlemagne
his
voice
was
unequal
to
his
physical
scale
at
his
own
jokes
because
they
came
to
him
as
part
of
the
joint
findings
of
the
quest
something
he
had
seen
and
collected
and
brought
for
the
pot
when
he
made
jokes
about
his
size
as
he
so
commonly
did
at
the
outset
of
a
speech
it
was
to
get
rid
of
the
elevation
of
the
platform
and
to
get
on
to
easy
equal
terms
with
the
audience
i
am
not
a
cat
burglar
he
began
to
the
union
at
oxford
and
had
won
them
the
radio
suited
him
so
excellently
precisely
because
it
is
a
personal
sitting
down
man
to
man
relationship
that
the
successful
broadcaster
must
establish
that
was
the
relationship
inside
which
he
naturally
thought
his
difficulty
was
that
while
he
had
not
the
faintest
desire
to
be
a
literary
man
and
still
less
a
prophet
the
kind
of
truth
he
divined
was
in
fact
on
the
scale
of
the
prophets
it
seemed
to
me
that
over
the
last
decade
of
his
life
he
found
himself
more
and
more
in
the
dilemma
that
in
the
life
of
his
mind
he
was
living
with
ideas
the
fruit
of
a
contemplative
preoccupation
with
the
incarnation
and
the
sacraments
which
he
shrank
from
talking
about
from
a
natural
humility
and
a
clear
and
grateful
understanding
of
the
catholic
tradition
of
reverence
and
reticence
england
is
full
enough
of
men
to
whom
the
distinction
between
the
platform
and
the
pulpit
is
very
unreal
they
have
a
moral
message
and
they
do
not
much
mind
where
they
give
it
but
chesterton
unlike
most
public
men
who
deal
in
general
ideas
did
not
come
to
the
idea
of
public
speaking
through
the
protestant
tradition
but
through
the
secular
tradition
the
freethinker
debate
the
political
and
not
the
religious
side
of
hyde
park
oratory
where
men
in
knots
shout
one
another
down
not
where
some
lonely
longhaired
prophet
declaims
conversion
after
he
became
a
catholic
he
sought
to
set
himself
frontiers
the
apologetic
territory
suitable
for
a
layman
like
himself
but
he
found
himself
more
and
more
preoccupied
with
a
territory
further
inland
penetrating
all
the
time
to
the
deeper
meaning
of
the
creed
he
had
embraced
he
could
look
back
and
see
how
most
of
his
early
books
had
seized
upon
some
essential
part
of
catholic
doctrine
he
had
written
what
he
had
seen
at
the
time
but
he
did
not
stop
looking
because
he
had
written
and
then
he
always
continued
to
see
more
the
great
contemplative
he
looked
out
on
the
universe
from
a
very
solid
tower
of
observation
because
in
all
but
the
deepest
sense
of
the
word
he
always
had
a
home
his
lasting
significance
is
his
pilgrimage
but
the
spiritual
journey
was
lived
out
in
a
warmly
rich
setting
when
he
wrote
of
the
home
he
was
not
dealing
with
a
notion
but
with
a
surrounding
reality
one
on
which
he
had
opened
his
eyes
as
a
baby
and
which
he
enjoyed
without
a
break
to
the
end
frances
chesterton
is
among
the
great
wives
of
our
literary
history
when
he
said
i
can
never
have
enough
nothing
to
do
it
was
the
remark
of
a
man
with
a
house
he
was
generally
in
a
house
full
of
things
he
loved
to
produce
cigars
and
wine
but
tea
also
remained
an
important
fixed
part
of
the
day
in
the
victorian
tradition
and
when
he
was
told
by
the
doctor
he
had
better
drink
nothing
he
had
many
alternatives
like
detective
stories
read
over
tea
and
buns
which
other
lovers
of
wine
would
perhaps
have
found
no
consolation
other
men
are
secret
drinkers
he
would
confide
i
am
a
secret
teetotaller
the
first
time
i
had
tea
with
him
in
artillery
mansions
in
i
was
much
struck
that
he
brought
three
detective
stories
to
the
teatable
i
imagine
he
always
had
time
for
redskin
on
the
or
whatever
it
might
be
because
he
had
the
gift
to
an
extent
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
of
opening
a
book
and
as
it
were
pouring
the
contents
down
in
one
draught
like
a
champion
german
beer
drinker
he
once
seized
from
my
shelves
in
lincoln
inn
wyndham
of
saying
it
was
a
book
he
had
not
seen
and
wanted
to
see
it
is
a
folio
and
i
suggested
he
should
take
it
away
but
he
opened
it
and
stood
reading
it
and
here
and
there
not
a
process
which
could
be
called
dipping
but
a
kind
of
sucking
out
of
the
printed
contents
as
though
he
were
a
vacuum
cleaner
and
you
could
see
the
lines
of
type
leaving
the
pages
and
being
absorbed
when
he
put
it
down
it
was
to
discuss
the
thesis
and
illustrations
of
the
book
as
a
man
fully
possessed
of
its
whole
standpoint
once
he
made
one
of
his
common
confusions
and
forgot
he
was
addressing
the
wiseman
dining
society
on
the
oxford
movement
in
the
train
from
beaconsfield
he
said
how
nice
it
was
that
he
had
not
got
to
speak
frances
chesterton
told
him
not
to
be
silly
he
knew
he
was
speaking
on
the
oxford
movement
he
was
visibly
disconcerted
at
the
start
for
many
grave
seniors
had
assembled
to
hear
him
but
all
went
well
in
the
discussion
as
soon
as
he
was
attacked
for
something
he
had
said
about
newman
views
you
can
not
catch
me
out
about
newman
he
said
with
joy
of
battle
and
he
produced
then
and
there
a
most
detailed
account
of
just
where
in
newman
writings
the
points
in
question
were
developed
yet
he
was
curiously
content
to
read
what
happened
to
come
his
way
and
to
rely
upon
his
friends
for
references
and
facts
remembering
what
they
might
tell
him
but
not
ordering
the
books
which
would
have
greatly
strengthened
him
in
the
sort
of
newspaper
arguments
in
which
he
was
so
often
employed
he
had
a
large
collection
of
books
at
topmeadow
but
they
gave
the
impression
that
they
had
assembled
themselves
masses
of
them
were
adventure
stories
many
were
presentation
copies
from
writers
you
felt
that
they
had
got
into
the
house
knowing
that
it
was
a
hospitable
one
if
not
built
for
books
and
that
they
would
probably
be
allowed
to
stay
but
he
had
a
study
which
would
barely
home
him
and
the
library
room
he
did
eventually
build
was
only
finished
as
he
died
i
think
nothing
is
more
superficial
or
belittling
to
him
than
the
idea
that
while
he
might
have
liked
the
real
country
he
could
not
like
beaconsfield
as
it
developed
into
a
dormitory
town
while
he
lived
there
his
sympathies
were
far
too
wide
he
liked
to
tell
how
he
had
had
to
complain
of
the
noise
made
by
an
adjoining
cinema
company
his
secretary
had
said
chesterton
finds
he
can
not
write
and
the
cinema
people
replied
we
are
well
aware
of
that
he
liked
to
think
of
garvin
near
by
not
that
i
see
him
very
much
he
said
but
i
like
to
think
that
that
great
factory
is
steaming
away
night
and
day
he
had
great
satisfaction
when
a
friend
and
i
driving
away
in
the
evening
knocked
down
a
white
wooden
post
outside
the
house
in
starting
the
car
he
held
that
he
had
witnessed
just
how
many
a
grand
old
local
custom
must
have
originated
in
men
covering
up
their
mistakes
by
saying
they
were
fulfilling
a
ritual
which
had
fallen
into
neglect
you
must
say
you
did
it
on
purpose
he
said
say
it
was
a
rite
too
long
omitted
and
it
will
soon
be
kept
up
every
year
and
men
will
forget
its
origin
and
it
will
be
known
as
the
bump
of
beaconsfield
when
a
friend
of
his
brought
him
a
african
spear
he
said
as
he
threw
it
about
the
lawn
that
it
was
sad
to
think
how
many
lawns
there
were
in
beaconsfield
and
how
few
weapons
were
ever
thrown
on
any
of
them
although
all
men
enjoyed
or
would
enjoy
spear
throwing
more
he
believed
than
they
enjoyed
clock
golf
he
at
any
rate
was
a
genuinely
free
man
who
did
what
it
amused
and
pleased
him
to
do
and
did
not
think
he
had
to
choose
between
the
forms
of
activity
or
rest
currently
pursued
by
his
neighbours
much
of
the
serene
atmosphere
of
his
home
came
from
that
quiet
resolute
practice
of
the
liberty
of
a
free
mind
chapter
xxviii
columbus
wished
to
discover
america
his
gay
and
thoughtless
friends
who
could
not
understand
him
pointed
out
that
america
had
already
been
discovered
i
think
they
said
by
christopher
columbus
some
time
ago
and
that
there
were
big
cities
of
people
there
already
new
york
and
boston
and
so
on
but
the
admiral
explained
to
them
kindly
enough
that
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
they
might
have
discovered
america
but
he
had
from
in
coloured
in
the
chapter
of
his
entitled
the
incomplete
traveller
chesterton
has
said
after
all
the
strangest
country
i
ever
visited
was
england
it
was
of
the
very
essence
of
his
philosophy
that
each
one
of
us
has
to
make
again
the
discoveries
of
our
ancestors
if
we
are
to
be
travellers
and
not
trippers
the
traveller
sees
what
he
sees
the
tripper
sees
what
he
has
come
to
see
thus
chesterton
tried
to
discover
each
country
that
he
visited
and
he
records
that
the
nearer
countries
are
sometimes
harder
to
discover
than
the
more
remote
for
poland
is
more
akin
to
england
than
is
france
ireland
more
mysterious
than
italy
france
ireland
and
supremely
palestine
brought
their
contribution
to
that
mental
and
spiritual
development
traced
in
earlier
chapters
on
ireland
rome
jerusalem
and
the
united
states
he
wrote
books
it
may
really
be
said
that
on
the
states
he
wrote
two
books
for
in
the
volume
of
essays
on
new
london
and
newer
which
followed
his
second
visit
he
showed
a
much
greater
understanding
than
in
i
saw
in
his
first
visit
took
place
in
his
second
in
on
the
first
trip
frances
kept
clippings
of
almost
all
their
interviews
gilbert
himself
said
that
while
the
headlines
in
american
newspapers
became
obscure
in
their
violent
efforts
to
startle
what
was
written
underneath
the
headlines
was
usually
good
journalism
and
the
press
cuttings
of
this
tour
bear
out
his
remark
interviewers
report
accurately
and
with
a
good
deal
of
humour
sketches
of
personal
appearance
abound
and
if
occasionally
they
contradict
one
another
in
detail
they
yet
contrive
to
convey
a
vivid
and
fairly
truthful
impression
of
the
leonine
head
the
bulky
form
the
gestures
and
mannerisms
that
a
man
of
letters
and
lecturer
should
choose
to
wear
proudly
not
one
of
these
titles
but
that
of
journalist
was
pleasing
and
flattering
to
the
brotherhood
the
atmosphere
of
the
tour
is
best
conveyed
by
rather
copious
quotation
a
crowd
of
journalists
met
him
at
the
boat
one
of
them
writes
of
his
voluminous
figure
quite
imposing
when
he
stands
up
though
not
so
abundantly
johnsonian
as
his
pictures
lead
one
to
expect
he
has
cascades
of
grey
hair
above
a
pinkly
beaming
face
a
rather
straggly
blond
mustache
and
eyes
that
seem
frequently
to
be
taking
up
infinity
in
a
serious
way
his
falsetto
laugh
prominent
teeth
and
general
aspect
are
rather
rooseveltian
chesterton
who
is
accompanied
by
chesterton
and
who
will
deliver
a
lecture
soon
in
boston
on
the
ignorance
of
the
educated
said
he
did
not
expect
to
go
further
west
than
chicago
since
having
seen
both
jerusalem
and
chicago
i
think
i
shall
have
touched
on
the
extremes
of
civilization
in
the
event
he
visited
omaha
and
oklahoma
city
and
went
south
as
far
as
nashville
tennessee
possibly
frances
had
thought
she
would
pass
unnoticed
but
in
fact
besides
constant
photographs
of
the
pair
the
lynx
eye
of
the
interviewer
was
upon
her
as
much
as
upon
him
on
arrival
at
new
york
he
shook
hands
with
some
customs
officials
who
welcomed
him
to
the
city
on
their
own
behalf
the
impression
given
by
chesterton
as
he
moved
majestically
along
the
pier
or
on
the
ship
was
one
of
huge
bulk
to
the
ordinary
sized
people
on
the
pier
he
seemed
to
blot
out
the
liner
and
the
river
chesterton
was
busy
with
the
baggage
my
wife
understands
these
things
he
said
with
a
sweep
of
his
stick
i
do
in
order
to
get
the
two
figures
into
the
same
picture
one
of
the
newspaper
photographers
requested
chesterton
to
sit
in
a
big
armchair
while
his
wife
stood
beside
him
when
they
were
settled
in
the
required
pose
he
exclaimed
i
say
i
do
like
this
people
will
think
that
i
am
a
german
another
newspaper
remarks
he
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
who
looked
very
small
beside
him
she
attended
to
the
baggage
examination
opening
trunks
and
bags
while
her
husband
delivered
a
short
essay
on
the
equality
of
men
and
women
in
england
since
the
war
this
reporter
was
perhaps
not
without
irony
but
if
it
actually
happened
like
that
must
have
seen
the
joke
too
for
he
has
a
similar
situation
in
the
first
scene
of
his
play
the
judgement
of
dr
johnson
the
same
reporter
adds
that
chesterton
speaks
in
essays
so
that
his
interviewers
received
a
brief
essay
instead
of
a
direct
reply
to
a
leading
question
we
next
come
upon
them
in
their
new
york
hotel
i
found
with
chesterton
at
the
biltmore
this
big
gentle
leonine
man
of
letters
six
feet
of
him
and
odd
lbs
there
is
a
delightful
story
of
how
an
american
driving
with
him
through
london
remarked
everyone
seems
to
know
you
mr
chesterton
yes
mournfully
responded
the
gargantuan
author
and
if
they
do
they
ask
he
really
does
look
anything
like
as
fat
as
his
caricatures
make
him
however
and
he
has
a
head
big
enough
to
go
with
his
massive
tallness
his
eyes
are
brilliant
english
blue
behind
the
big
rimmed
eyeglasses
his
wavy
hair
steel
grey
his
heavy
mustache
bright
yellow
physically
he
is
the
crackling
electric
spark
of
the
party
the
only
man
who
can
give
the
cleverest
radical
debaters
a
roland
for
their
oliver
in
subsequent
interviews
height
grew
to
six
foot
three
and
his
weight
to
lbs
which
was
surely
closer
to
the
mark
his
mannerisms
were
greatly
remarked
chesterton
speaks
clearly
in
a
rather
voice
he
accompanies
his
remarks
with
many
nervous
little
gestures
his
hands
at
times
stray
into
his
pockets
he
leans
over
the
reading
desk
as
if
he
would
like
to
get
down
into
the
audience
and
make
it
a
sort
of
talk
chesterton
right
hand
spent
a
restless
and
rather
disturbing
evening
it
would
start
from
the
reading
desk
at
which
he
stood
and
fall
to
the
points
of
that
vast
waistcoat
which
inspired
the
description
of
him
as
a
fellow
of
infinite
vest
it
would
wander
aimlessly
a
moment
about
his
stomach
is
a
word
that
is
taboo
among
the
polite
english
equator
and
then
shift
swiftly
to
the
rear
until
the
thumb
found
the
hip
pocket
there
the
hand
would
rest
a
moment
to
return
again
to
the
reading
desk
and
to
describe
once
more
the
quarter
circle
once
in
a
while
it
would
twist
a
ring
upon
the
left
hand
once
in
a
while
it
would
be
clasped
behind
the
broad
back
but
only
for
a
moment
to
the
hip
pocket
and
back
again
was
its
and
it
was
a
faithful
soldier
several
interviewers
remark
on
the
unexpected
calibre
of
his
voice
he
himself
spoke
of
it
as
the
mouse
that
came
forth
from
the
mountain
one
would
never
suspect
him
of
being
our
leading
american
his
accent
mannerisms
and
dress
are
and
he
likes
his
oolong
with
a
lump
of
sugar
he
thinks
with
his
cigar
a
black
london
cheeroot
he
gilbert
chesterton
was
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
expertly
brewed
by
chesterton
when
a
reporter
yesterday
entered
his
room
at
the
blackstone
in
chicago
before
he
submitted
to
interrogation
he
lighted
the
cigar
my
muse
he
explained
a
parnassian
pleasure
tobacco
smoke
is
the
ichor
of
mental
life
some
men
write
with
a
pencil
others
with
a
typewriter
i
write
with
my
cigar
throughout
the
interview
he
was
profoundly
concerned
not
with
the
subjects
under
discussion
but
with
the
black
cheeroot
seven
times
it
went
out
seven
times
he
relighted
it
the
eighth
time
he
tossed
it
away
when
asked
which
of
his
works
he
considered
the
greatest
he
said
i
do
consider
any
of
my
works
in
the
least
great
slang
he
said
is
too
sacred
and
precious
to
be
used
promiscuously
its
use
should
be
led
up
to
reverently
for
it
expresses
what
the
king
english
could
not
seeing
and
hearing
a
man
like
gilbert
keith
chesterton
said
a
detroit
newspaper
makes
a
meal
for
the
imagination
that
no
reading
of
books
by
him
or
about
him
can
accomplish
he
spoke
sunday
in
orchestra
hall
on
the
ignorance
of
the
educated
it
grows
more
difficult
as
his
tour
progresses
he
admits
and
the
lecture
he
insists
grows
worse
his
thesis
is
that
the
besetting
evil
of
all
educated
people
is
that
they
tend
to
substitute
theories
for
things
the
uneducated
man
never
makes
this
mistake
he
states
the
simple
fact
that
he
sees
a
german
drinking
beer
he
does
not
say
there
is
a
teuton
consuming
alcohol
at
toronto
the
chairman
a
professor
of
english
thought
that
there
must
have
been
an
error
in
the
title
as
printed
and
announced
that
chesterton
would
speak
on
the
ignorance
of
the
another
detroit
newspaper
quotes
from
the
lecture
there
is
a
deeper
side
to
such
fallacies
the
whole
catastrophe
of
the
great
war
may
be
traced
to
the
racial
theory
if
people
had
looked
at
peoples
as
nations
in
place
of
races
the
intolerable
ambition
of
prussia
might
have
been
stopped
before
it
attained
the
captaincy
of
the
south
german
states
the
only
other
lecture
subjects
mentioned
are
shall
we
abolish
the
inevitable
and
the
perils
of
health
there
are
innumerable
caricatures
one
by
cosmo
hamilton
is
accompanied
with
a
story
of
how
he
once
debated
with
chesterton
the
subject
was
there
is
no
law
in
england
made
so
overwhelming
a
case
that
hamilton
decided
the
only
way
of
making
reply
possible
was
to
twist
the
subject
making
it
there
are
no
laws
in
england
and
go
off
at
tangents
like
a
worried
terrier
to
hear
chesterton
howl
of
joy
when
he
twigged
how
i
had
slipped
out
to
see
him
double
himself
up
in
an
agony
of
laughter
at
my
personal
insults
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
sportsmanship
on
a
shocked
audience
who
were
won
to
mirth
by
his
intense
and
quarks
of
joy
was
a
sight
and
a
sound
for
the
gods
probably
chesterton
has
forgotten
this
incident
but
i
have
and
never
will
and
i
carried
away
from
that
room
a
respect
and
admiration
for
this
tomboy
among
dictionaries
this
philosophical
peter
pan
this
humorous
johnson
this
kindly
and
gallant
cherub
this
profound
student
and
wise
master
which
has
grown
steadily
ever
since
in
the
hamilton
later
described
speaking
in
this
debate
during
the
whole
inspired
course
of
his
brilliant
reasoning
he
caught
the
little
rivulets
which
ran
down
his
face
and
just
as
they
were
about
to
drop
from
the
first
of
his
several
chins
flicked
them
generously
among
the
disconcerted
people
who
sat
actually
at
his
feet
from
time
to
time
too
unaware
of
this
he
grasped
deep
into
his
pockets
and
rattled
coins
and
keys
going
from
point
to
point
from
proof
to
proof
until
the
constitution
of
england
was
quite
devoid
of
law
and
out
from
under
his
waistcoat
bulged
a
line
of
shirt
it
was
monstrous
gigantic
amazing
deadly
delicious
nothing
like
it
has
ever
been
done
before
or
will
ever
be
seen
heard
and
felt
like
it
again
a
clever
caricature
depicts
dickens
in
one
corner
his
arms
full
of
bricks
hammers
and
jagged
objects
labelled
american
notes
the
rest
of
the
picture
is
an
immense
drawing
of
a
smiling
chesterton
his
arms
full
of
roses
labelled
kind
words
for
america
he
is
pointing
at
dickens
and
saying
america
must
have
changed
a
great
deal
since
then
not
only
gilbert
but
also
frances
was
constantly
interviewed
i
tell
them
one
interviewer
quotes
her
as
saying
that
i
did
know
i
was
the
wife
of
a
great
man
till
i
came
to
america
it
never
bothered
me
before
this
coming
from
one
of
those
english
wives
so
popularly
portrayed
as
representing
the
acme
of
submission
was
delightful
a
slight
slim
little
figure
looking
slighter
and
slimmer
in
the
wake
of
her
overshadowing
husband
with
an
outward
appearance
of
unsurpassed
mildness
and
meekness
which
her
conversation
readily
dispelled
the
wife
of
this
delightful
englishman
of
letters
presented
a
very
intimate
chestertonian
paradox
frances
kept
a
diary
of
which
almost
the
first
entry
is
so
far
my
feelings
towards
this
country
are
entirely
hostile
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
judge
too
soon
we
have
refused
all
invitations
it
the
only
thing
to
do
this
idea
they
must
have
abandoned
for
one
paper
after
gilbert
death
describes
him
as
an
immense
success
socially
but
a
big
bland
failure
as
a
lecturer
as
the
tour
proceeds
the
entries
in
the
diary
become
more
favorable
but
unlike
her
letters
from
poland
where
what
she
liked
best
was
anything
really
polish
the
diary
shows
frances
as
singling
out
for
approval
those
things
approximately
english
houses
where
she
stayed
in
boston
and
philadelphia
she
hated
hustle
heat
and
crowds
and
the
diary
is
full
of
remarks
about
her
exhaustion
commented
in
one
interview
on
the
different
conception
of
a
club
in
england
and
in
america
while
groups
of
men
entertained
him
women
clubs
were
entertaining
his
wife
but
an
english
club
is
really
a
promoter
of
unsociability
and
while
the
english
woman
in
her
club
does
not
perhaps
stare
into
vacancy
with
the
same
fervour
fixity
and
ferocity
as
the
english
man
still
there
is
something
of
the
sort
you
know
after
a
lecture
in
philadelphia
a
lady
asked
him
chesterton
what
makes
women
talk
so
much
heaving
himself
out
of
his
chair
he
answered
only
god
madam
two
further
caricatures
were
an
impression
drawn
by
will
coyne
for
the
new
york
of
chesterton
as
porthos
of
the
pen
and
another
drawn
for
the
new
york
by
stewart
davis
of
chesterton
supplying
paradoxygen
to
the
world
this
was
accompanied
by
a
poem
called
paradoxygen
by
edward
anthony
o
gilbert
i
know
there
are
many
who
like
your
talks
on
the
darkness
of
light
the
shortness
of
length
and
the
weakness
of
strength
and
the
one
on
the
lowness
of
height
my
neighbour
keeps
telling
me
how
i
adore
his
legality
of
the
illicit
and
i
also
a
liking
intense
for
his
striking
obscurity
of
the
explicit
but
i
am
unmoved
what
the
reason
well
the
same
i
intend
to
expound
some
evening
next
week
when
i
going
to
speak
on
the
shallowness
of
the
profound
everyone
who
goes
to
america
for
a
short
time
said
is
expected
to
write
a
book
and
nearly
everybody
does
in
accordance
with
this
convention
he
wrote
i
saw
in
he
did
see
a
great
deal
the
same
imagination
that
had
found
the
mediaeval
aspect
of
jerusalem
saw
many
elements
missed
not
only
by
the
ordinary
tourist
but
by
the
people
themselves
who
live
nearest
to
them
thus
he
keenly
appreciated
the
traditional
elements
in
philadelphia
boston
and
baltimore
in
coming
into
some
of
these
more
stable
cities
of
the
states
i
felt
something
quite
sincerely
of
that
historic
emotion
which
is
satisfied
in
the
eternal
cities
of
the
mediterranean
i
felt
in
america
what
many
americans
suppose
can
only
be
felt
in
europe
i
have
seldom
had
that
sentiment
stirred
more
simply
and
directly
than
when
i
saw
from
afar
off
above
that
vast
grey
labyrinth
of
philadelphia
great
penn
upon
his
pinnacle
like
the
graven
figure
of
a
god
who
had
fashioned
a
new
world
and
remembered
that
his
body
lay
buried
in
a
field
at
the
turning
of
a
lane
a
league
from
my
own
door
in
baltimore
the
catholic
history
appealed
to
him
yet
more
strongly
and
invited
to
visit
cardinal
gibbons
he
felt
himself
touching
the
end
of
a
living
chain
in
boston
much
more
beautiful
than
its
name
he
companioned
again
with
the
autocrat
and
recalled
how
in
his
own
youth
english
and
american
literature
seemed
to
be
one
thing
indeed
he
was
there
reminded
even
of
english
things
that
have
largely
vanished
from
england
washington
he
saw
both
as
a
beautiful
city
and
an
idea
a
sort
of
paradise
of
impersonal
politics
without
personal
commerce
and
in
nashville
tennessee
it
was
with
a
sort
of
intensity
of
feeling
that
he
found
himself
before
a
dim
and
faded
picture
and
from
the
dark
canvas
looked
forth
the
face
of
andrew
jackson
watchful
like
a
white
eagle
the
things
chesterton
chose
for
description
all
have
relevance
to
the
main
thesis
of
the
book
which
has
often
been
missed
and
which
emerges
most
clearly
in
the
first
and
the
last
chapters
he
insists
always
that
he
writes
as
a
foreigner
and
indeed
repeats
frequently
that
it
is
by
keeping
our
own
distinct
nationality
that
englishmen
and
americans
will
best
understand
and
like
one
another
but
he
writes
also
as
a
man
not
unconscious
of
history
thus
writing
the
older
cities
represent
to
him
one
trend
in
the
states
and
new
york
another
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
does
not
appreciate
new
york
as
he
ought
because
of
his
dislike
of
cosmopolitanism
its
beauty
he
sees
as
not
solid
and
abiding
but
a
kind
of
fairyland
the
lights
on
broadway
evoked
from
him
the
exclamation
what
a
glorious
garden
of
wonders
this
would
be
for
anyone
who
was
lucky
enough
to
be
unable
to
read
and
he
imagines
a
simple
peasant
who
fancies
that
they
must
be
announcing
in
letters
of
fire
liberty
equality
fraternity
and
must
be
put
up
on
occasion
of
some
great
national
feast
whereas
they
are
but
advertising
signs
put
up
to
make
money
the
skyline
seemed
to
him
most
lovely
vertical
lines
that
suggest
a
sort
of
rush
upwards
as
of
great
cataracts
topsy
turvy
the
strong
daylight
finds
everywhere
the
broken
edges
of
things
and
the
sort
of
hues
we
see
in
newly
turned
earth
or
the
white
sections
of
trees
he
feels
the
intense
imaginative
pleasure
of
those
dizzy
turrets
and
dancing
fires
but
he
ends
with
the
note
that
really
spoilt
new
york
for
him
if
those
nightmare
buildings
were
really
all
built
for
nothing
how
noble
they
would
be
advertisement
big
business
monopoly
might
have
invaded
the
old
traditionary
cities
of
america
as
they
had
those
of
england
but
new
york
existed
he
felt
as
a
new
and
startling
expression
of
them
they
shrieked
in
every
light
and
from
every
the
whole
question
of
america
was
would
the
older
simpler
really
great
historical
tradition
win
or
would
it
be
defeated
by
the
new
and
towering
evil
he
has
an
interesting
chapter
on
the
countryside
finding
hope
in
the
considerable
extension
of
small
ownership
among
the
farmers
and
in
the
houses
built
from
the
growing
material
that
wood
is
but
he
is
again
depressed
at
the
reflection
that
the
culture
of
the
countryside
is
not
its
own
but
imported
from
the
towns
therefore
itself
largely
commercialised
roaming
over
the
world
in
search
of
his
examples
chesterton
sees
the
ideal
of
the
early
republicans
as
dead
in
the
republics
of
today
and
nowhere
more
dead
than
in
america
it
would
be
useless
he
feels
to
invoke
jefferson
or
lincoln
in
the
modern
world
against
the
tyranny
of
or
in
favour
of
racial
justice
because
the
bridge
of
brotherhood
had
broken
down
in
the
modern
mind
jefferson
the
deist
said
the
sight
of
slavery
in
his
country
made
him
tremble
remembering
that
god
is
just
but
the
modern
who
has
lost
these
absolute
standards
has
grown
dizzy
with
degree
and
relativity
hence
came
the
same
terrible
peril
in
both
england
and
america
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
new
plutocracy
the
idea
of
manhood
has
gone
there
were
different
sorts
of
apes
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
we
were
the
superior
sort
only
in
one
direction
did
he
see
real
hope
the
new
dreams
of
the
century
had
gone
but
the
ancient
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
remained
catholics
might
forget
brotherhood
like
their
fellows
but
the
catholic
type
of
christianity
had
rivetted
itself
irrevocably
to
the
manhood
of
all
men
the
church
would
always
continue
to
ordain
negroes
and
canonise
beggars
and
labourers
where
its
faith
was
fixed
by
creeds
and
councils
it
could
not
save
itself
even
by
surrender
there
is
no
basis
for
democracy
except
in
a
dogma
about
the
divine
origin
of
man
i
have
put
that
final
sentence
in
capitals
for
it
is
the
climax
both
of
gilbert
thinking
about
america
and
of
one
of
the
most
important
trains
of
thought
that
brought
him
to
the
home
of
liberty
secured
for
the
human
race
by
dogma
that
is
to
say
by
revealed
truth
he
went
home
to
be
received
into
the
catholic
church
as
i
have
earlier
related
i
saw
in
is
of
special
importance
in
relation
to
later
discussions
in
while
the
journalists
seemed
convinced
on
his
first
visit
that
he
had
nothing
but
roses
to
throw
and
compared
him
favorably
to
dickens
a
collection
of
quotations
could
be
made
from
of
a
quite
opposite
kind
yet
i
do
not
think
he
ever
attacks
america
as
much
as
he
attacks
england
he
was
himself
much
amused
at
finding
he
was
expected
to
be
either
for
america
or
against
america
both
of
which
attitudes
appeared
to
him
absurd
in
that
sense
he
was
neither
for
nor
against
his
own
country
he
liked
americans
he
disliked
certain
trends
in
america
because
he
loved
england
he
disliked
the
same
trends
even
more
in
england
certain
things
in
modern
civilisation
which
he
hated
he
did
regard
as
primarily
american
american
comfort
to
him
seemed
acute
discomfort
he
thought
every
american
lives
in
an
airless
furnace
in
the
middle
of
which
he
sits
and
eats
lumps
of
ice
he
had
a
great
hatred
of
intelligence
tests
which
he
called
the
palpable
balderdash
of
irresponsible
yankee
boomsters
it
is
really
one
of
the
maladies
of
american
democracy
to
be
swept
by
these
prairie
fires
of
fads
and
throw
itself
into
eugenics
or
anthropometric
inquiry
with
the
buoyancy
of
babies
he
believed
that
there
was
more
democracy
in
america
than
in
england
but
he
hated
what
he
called
the
glare
of
american
advertisement
he
spoke
of
a
common
thief
like
the
american
millionaire
but
he
certainly
did
not
exclude
the
english
millionaire
from
the
same
indictment
his
whole
view
of
advertisement
reaches
a
peak
in
an
entitled
if
you
have
smiles
december
we
read
the
other
day
an
absolutely
solemn
and
almost
tender
piece
of
advice
in
a
leading
american
magazine
about
the
preservation
of
beauty
and
health
it
was
intended
quite
seriously
after
describing
in
most
complicated
detail
how
the
young
woman
of
today
well
known
to
be
enamored
of
all
that
is
natural
and
free
is
to
strap
up
her
head
and
face
every
night
as
if
it
had
to
be
bandaged
after
an
accident
it
proceeds
to
say
with
the
most
refined
american
accent
with
the
face
thus
fixed
in
smile
formation
but
we
have
a
difficulty
about
taking
this
serious
advice
of
american
beauty
business
even
so
seriously
as
to
meditate
on
its
social
menace
the
prospect
of
such
a
world
of
idiots
ought
to
depress
us
but
no
it
is
no
good
our
faces
are
fixed
in
smile
formation
when
we
think
of
that
american
he
repeated
often
how
much
he
liked
the
inhabitants
of
main
street
grievously
wronged
by
sinclair
lewis
american
ideals
are
not
nearly
so
nice
as
american
realities
we
lament
not
so
much
what
babbitt
is
as
what
he
is
trying
to
be
what
he
is
is
a
simple
and
kindly
man
what
he
trying
to
be
is
the
abomination
of
desolation
the
man
who
made
salesmanship
an
art
the
man
who
would
not
stay
down
the
man
who
got
the
million
dollar
post
after
taking
our
correspondence
course
the
man
who
learned
social
charm
in
six
lessons
at
the
time
of
the
depreciation
of
the
franc
belloc
articles
in
echoed
in
the
leaders
pointed
to
finance
especially
american
finance
as
the
criminal
that
was
forcing
down
the
french
currency
an
american
correspondent
in
the
paper
attacked
these
attacks
on
the
ground
that
they
were
inspired
by
british
imperialism
chesterton
felt
it
a
little
hard
to
be
at
this
date
confused
with
kipling
he
replied
that
his
correspondent
committed
the
blunder
of
an
extravagant
and
excessive
admiration
for
england
he
speaks
of
that
tremendous
procession
that
passed
through
paris
literally
an
army
of
cripples
it
was
a
march
of
all
those
walking
units
those
living
fragments
of
humanity
that
had
been
left
by
the
long
stand
of
five
years
upon
the
french
frontiers
a
devastated
area
that
passed
endlessly
like
a
river
they
illustrate
the
main
fact
that
france
was
in
the
center
of
that
fighting
line
of
civilization
that
it
was
upon
her
that
the
barbarian
quarrel
concentrated
and
that
is
an
historical
fact
which
the
foolish
vanity
of
many
englishmen
as
well
as
of
many
americans
is
perpetually
tempted
to
deny
our
critic
is
therefore
quite
beside
the
mark
if
he
imagines
that
i
am
trying
to
score
off
his
country
out
of
a
cheap
jealousy
on
behalf
of
my
own
my
jealousy
is
for
justice
and
for
a
large
historical
understanding
of
this
great
passage
in
history
my
own
country
won
glory
enough
in
that
and
other
fields
to
make
it
quite
unnecessary
for
any
sane
englishman
to
shut
his
eyes
to
europe
in
order
to
brag
about
england
i
have
not
the
faintest
doubt
what
thomas
jefferson
would
have
said
if
he
had
been
told
that
a
few
financial
oligarchs
who
happen
to
live
in
new
york
were
beating
down
the
french
wealth
and
had
then
seen
pass
before
him
that
awful
panorama
of
the
wrecks
of
the
french
republican
army
like
a
resurrection
of
the
dead
i
do
not
admit
therefore
that
in
supporting
the
french
peasants
and
soldiers
against
the
money
dealers
and
of
the
town
i
am
attacking
america
or
even
merely
defending
france
on
november
and
he
writes
two
articles
on
the
yankee
and
the
chinaman
in
which
he
contrasts
the
philosophic
spirit
with
the
scientific
like
bishop
barnes
in
england
wanting
to
analyse
the
consecrated
host
edison
was
reported
in
america
as
having
said
that
he
would
find
out
if
there
was
a
soul
by
some
scientific
test
any
philosophic
chinaman
would
know
what
to
think
of
a
man
who
said
i
have
got
a
new
gun
that
will
shoot
a
hole
through
your
memory
of
last
monday
or
i
have
got
a
saw
sharp
enough
to
cut
up
the
cube
root
of
or
i
will
boil
your
affection
for
aunt
susan
until
it
is
quite
liquid
in
gilbert
frances
and
dorothy
spent
a
month
in
poland
where
immense
enthusiasm
was
shown
for
the
man
who
had
consistently
proclaimed
poland
greatness
and
its
true
place
in
europe
invited
by
the
government
all
the
hospitality
i
received
he
says
was
far
too
much
alive
to
remind
me
of
anything
official
one
of
the
multitude
of
unwritten
books
of
which
dreamed
was
a
book
about
poland
the
poles
and
the
english
were
he
felt
alike
in
many
things
but
the
englishman
had
never
been
given
the
opportunity
to
understand
the
pole
we
knew
nothing
of
their
history
and
did
not
understand
the
resurrection
we
had
helped
to
bring
about
the
nonsense
talked
in
the
newspapers
when
they
discuss
what
they
call
the
polish
corridor
was
only
possible
from
want
of
realisation
of
what
poland
had
been
before
she
was
rent
in
three
by
prussia
austria
and
russia
thus
too
we
did
not
realise
the
fact
that
the
poles
always
have
a
choice
of
evils
pilsudski
told
him
that
the
he
preferred
germany
to
russia
while
dmowski
voiced
the
more
general
opinion
in
telling
him
that
the
he
preferred
russia
to
germany
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
tortured
poland
was
herself
and
incredibly
happy
revival
in
this
agricultural
country
had
been
amazingly
swift
peasant
proprietors
abounded
and
lived
well
on
twelve
acres
or
so
while
even
labourers
possessed
plots
of
land
and
a
cow
or
two
the
club
dinner
frances
wrote
in
a
letter
to
her
mother
was
i
fancy
considered
by
the
poles
a
huge
success
if
numbers
indicate
anything
it
certainly
was
i
found
it
a
little
embarrassing
to
have
to
eat
hot
kidneys
and
mushrooms
standing
about
with
hundreds
of
guests
and
this
was
only
the
preliminary
to
a
long
dinner
that
followed
and
refreshments
that
apparently
continued
until
two
in
the
morning
the
speeches
were
really
perfectly
marvellous
and
delivered
in
english
quite
colloquial
and
very
witty
and
showing
a
detailed
knowledge
of
gilbert
works
which
no
englishman
of
my
acquaintance
possesses
gilbert
made
an
excellent
in
fact
a
very
eloquent
speech
in
reply
which
drew
forth
thunders
of
applause
their
hosts
drove
the
chestertons
all
over
the
country
and
showed
them
home
life
on
the
little
farms
home
industries
and
arts
brightly
woven
garments
and
pottery
for
use
not
for
exhibition
and
the
great
historic
scenes
of
poland
history
with
the
scene
he
remembered
most
vividly
gilbert
musings
on
poland
conclude
they
were
visiting
a
young
nobleman
who
excused
the
devastation
of
his
own
home
by
bolshevik
soldiers
in
the
heat
of
battle
but
added
there
is
only
one
thing
i
really
resent
he
led
us
out
into
a
long
avenue
lined
with
poplars
and
at
the
end
of
it
was
a
statue
of
the
blessed
virgin
with
the
head
and
the
hands
shot
off
but
the
hands
had
been
lifted
and
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
the
very
mutilation
seemed
to
give
more
meaning
to
the
attitude
of
intercession
asking
mercy
for
the
merciless
race
of
men
p
karel
capek
who
had
long
wanted
chesterton
to
visit
prague
wrote
mournfully
you
wrote
me
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
you
to
come
to
prague
this
spring
but
it
was
in
the
newspapers
that
you
were
last
month
in
warsaw
why
in
heaven
sake
did
you
not
come
to
prague
on
this
occasion
what
a
pity
for
us
now
we
are
waiting
for
a
compensation
two
earlier
letters
had
shown
him
eager
for
contributions
from
chesterton
for
a
leading
review
another
delightful
letter
is
dated
december
no
year
given
my
dear
chesterton
it
is
just
christmas
eve
my
friends
presented
me

some
of
your
books

i
can
not
omit
to
thank

for
the
consolation
and
trust
i
found
there
as
already
so
many
times
be
blessed
chesterton
i
wrote
you
twice
without
getting
any
answer
but
it
is
christian
to
insist
and
so
i
write
you
again

would
you
be
so
kind
to
tell
me
if
it
shall

prague
our
pen
club
is
anxious
to
invite

of
honour
if

so
good

sincerely
karel
capek
he
never
alas
got
to
prague
or
to
many
another
country
that
wanted
him
there
are
letters
asking
him
to
lecture
in
australia
to
lecture
again
in
in
south
america
to
make
them
aware
of
english
thought
and
literature
the
argentine
intelligencia
says
philip
guedalla
is
acutely
aware
of
your
writings
local
professors
terrified
me
by
asking
me
on
various
occasions
to
explain
the
precise
position
which
you
occupied
in
our
catholic
youth
a
visit
from
you
would
mean
a
very
great
deal
to
british
intellectual
prestige
in
these
parts
no
catholic
englishman
was
anything
like
so
widely
known
in
europe
books
have
been
written
about
him
in
many
languages
and
his
works
translated
into
french
german
dutch
czech
russian
polish
spanish
and
italian
a
letter
from
russia
asks
for
his
photograph
for
magazine
of
international
as
a
writer
whose
works
are
well
known
in
the
soviet
union
the
kulturbund
in
vienna
sends
an
emissary
inviting
him
there
also
and
like
prague
the
vienna
club
wants
him
you
have
a
distressing
habit
maude
royden
once
wrote
of
being
the
only
person
one
really
wants
to
hear
on
certain
subjects
a
visit
to
rome
in
produced
resurrection
of
despite
brilliant
passages
the
book
is
disappointing
it
bears
no
comparison
with
new
and
gives
an
impression
of
being
thrown
together
hastily
before
the
ideas
had
been
thought
through
to
their
ultimate
conclusions
perhaps
rome
was
too
big
even
for
chesterton
he
never
loved
the
renaissance
as
he
did
the
middle
ages
but
he
saw
it
not
as
primarily
pagan
but
as
one
more
example
of
the
immense
vitality
of
a
catholicism
which
had
had
so
many
rebirths
that
it
had
buried
its
own
past
deeper
than
the
past
of
paganism
he
loved
the
fountains
that
threw
their
water
everywhere
and
he
felt
about
rome
that
the
greatest
monuments
might
be
removed
and
yet
the
personality
would
remain
for
rome
is
greater
than
her
monuments
he
wanted
to
argue
with
those
who
cared
for
pagan
rome
alone
and
who
spent
their
time
despising
the
oratory
in
stone
of
the
papal
city
and
gazing
only
on
the
forum
and
it
never
once
occurs
to
them
to
remember
that
the
old
romans
were
italians
or
to
ask
what
a
forum
was
for
he
was
as
usual
constantly
invited
to
lecture
at
the
english
college
the
scots
college
the
american
college
the
beda
at
the
holy
child
convent
he
spoke
to
a
crowded
audience
on
thomas
more
and
humanism
father
cuthbert
thanking
him
remarked
on
the
mental
resemblance
between
more
and
chesterton
saying
that
he
could
quite
well
imagine
them
sitting
together
making
jokes
some
of
them
very
good
and
some
of
them
very
bad
chesterton
and
more
says
father
vincent
mcnabb
were
both
cockneys
gilbert
classical
insight
also
seemed
to
him
like
the
great
chancellor
erasmus
says
that
though
more
did
know
much
greek
he
knew
what
the
words
ought
to
mean
he
interviewed
mussolini
and
found
that
mussolini
was
interviewing
him
so
that
he
talked
at
some
length
of
distributism
and
his
own
social
ideal
mussolini
knew
at
least
some
of
gilbert
books
he
told
cyril
clemens
that
he
had
keenly
enjoyed
man
who
was
he
promised
at
the
end
of
this
interview
that
he
would
go
away
and
think
over
what
chesterton
had
said
and
it
might
have
been
better
for
the
world
had
he
kept
that
promise
for
what
had
been
said
was
an
outline
of
the
one
possible
alternative
to
the
growing
tyranny
of
governments
from
his
anxiety
to
be
fair
to
fascism
gilbert
was
often
accused
of
being
in
favour
of
it
but
both
in
this
book
and
in
several
articles
having
given
the
case
for
it
he
went
on
to
give
the
case
against
it
a
much
stronger
case
than
that
usually
given
by
its
opponents
the
case
for
fascism
lay
in
the
breakdown
of
true
democracy
and
the
reign
of
the
tyranny
of
wealth
in
the
democratic
countries
chesterton
would
he
said
have
been
on
the
side
of
the
partito
popolare
as
against
the
fascism
that
succeeded
it
in
england
and
america
he
would
have
infinitely
preferred
that
the
purgation
of
our
plutocratic
politics
should
have
been
achieved
by
radicals
and
republicans
it
was
they
who
did
not
prefer
it
it
was
not
that
fascism
was
not
open
to
attack
but
that
liberalism
has
unfortunately
lost
the
right
to
attack
it
those
of
us
who
were
in
italy
at
that
time
will
remember
the
truth
of
his
description
of
the
vitality
and
happiness
that
seemed
to
glow
among
the
people
heard
everywhere
had
then
no
hollow
sound
at
the
heart
of
it
italy
was
radiant
with
hope
in
mussolini
himself
gilbert
saluted
a
belief
in
the
civic
necessity
of
virtue
in
the
ideal
that
public
life
should
be
public
in
human
dignity
in
respect
for
women
as
mothers
in
piety
and
the
honour
due
to
the
dead
yet
summing
up
the
man
and
the
movement
he
saw
it
as
primarily
the
sort
of
riot
that
is
provoked
by
the
evils
of
an
evil
government
only
in
the
italy
of
the
twentieth
century
the
rioters
have
become
the
rulers
for
although
mussolini
had
in
many
ways
made
his
rule
popular
although
in
his
concessions
to
modern
ideas
and
inventions
he
was
rather
breathlessly
progressive
yet
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
mussolini
was
a
reactionary
a
reactionary
is
one
who
merely
reacts
against
something
or
permits
that
something
to
make
him
do
something
against
it
a
reactionary
is
one
in
whom
weariness
itself
has
become
a
form
of
energy
even
when
he
is
right
there
is
always
a
danger
that
what
was
really
good
in
the
previous
society
may
be
destroyed
by
what
is
good
in
the
new
one
mussolini
reaction
was
against
the
liberalism
in
which
as
an
idea
chesterton
still
believed
it
was
a
reaction
from
democracy
to
authority
and
his
weakness
the
fundamental
weakness
of
fascism
was
that
it
appeals
to
an
appetite
for
authority
without
very
clearly
giving
the
authority
for
the
appetite
when
i
try
to
put
the
case
for
it
in
philosophical
terms
there
is
some
doubt
about
the
ultimates
of
the
philosophy
it
seemed
to
chesterton
that
there
were
only
two
possible
fixed
and
orderly
constitutions
hereditary
monarchy
or
majority
rule
the
demand
of
the
fascists
to
hold
power
as
an
intelligent
and
active
minority
was
in
fact
to
invite
other
intelligent
and
active
minorities
to
dispute
that
rule
and
then
only
by
tyranny
could
anarchy
be
prevented
fascism
he
said
in
summary
has
brought
back
order
into
the
state
but
this
will
not
be
lasting
unless
it
has
brought
back
order
into
the
mind
the
two
things
in
the
roman
visit
that
remain
most
prominent
in
dorothy
memory
are
gilbert
loss
of
a
medal
of
our
lady
that
he
always
wore
and
his
audience
with
the
holy
father
the
loss
of
the
medal
seemed
to
distress
him
out
of
all
normal
proportion
he
had
the
elevator
boy
looking
for
it
on
hands
and
knees
and
gave
him
a
huge
reward
for
finding
it
gilbert
has
left
no
record
of
his
papal
audience
but
says
dorothy
it
excited
him
so
greatly
that
he
did
no
work
for
two
days
before
the
event
or
two
days
after
their
second
visit
to
america
in
was
far
better
enjoyed
by
gilbert
and
also
i
think
by
frances
until
she
got
ill
because
on
it
they
came
much
closer
to
the
real
people
of
the
country
especially
during
the
period
when
he
was
lecturing
at
the
university
of
notre
dame
indiana
they
lived
at
a
little
house
in
south
bend
and
he
lectured
every
night
alternating
a
course
on
victorian
literature
with
one
on
the
great
figures
of
victorian
history
there
were
lectures
all
told
and
the
average
attendance
at
each
lecture
was
at
notre
dame
and
the
sister
college
of
mary
i
felt
the
best
way
to
get
the
atmosphere
of
this
visit
would
be
to
get
together
for
a
talk
the
people
who
remembered
gilbert
they
would
stimulate
one
another
memories
i
invoked
the
aid
of
sister
madeleva
and
she
suggested
the
two
fathers
leo
ward
professors
engels
and
and
best
of
all
johnnie
mangan
the
chauffeur
johnnie
is
a
great
institution
at
notre
dame
he
remembered
driving
my
father
nearly
thirty
years
ago
and
he
had
specially
vivid
memories
of
the
chesterton
period
we
all
sat
in
a
circle
in
sister
sitting
room
i
give
here
the
notes
i
took
johnnie
mangan
it
was
the
hardest
job
getting
him
into
the
car
harder
getting
him
out
he
walk
on
the
porch
and
all
the
children
came
he
talk
to
the
children
on
the
road
money
meant
nothing
to
him
the
lady
would
give
me
the
money
saying
himself
would
leave
it
in
the
shop
if
the
barber
was
honest
enough
to
give
change
he
enjoyed
everything
when
they
dedicated
the
stadium
he
stayed
till
the
very
end
father
introduced
him
to
all
the
naval
officers
and
he
was
the
last
off
the
ground
he
enjoyed
talking
to
all
the
naval
officers
he
loved
he
spent
one
evening
in
professor
phillips
room
after
the
lecture
from
to
his
host
was
deaf
learnt
later
and
he
made
another
date
when
he
found
his
host
had
missed
most
of
the
fun
engels
he
would
sit
around
consuming
ale
by
the
quart
said
the
head
of
the
philosophy
faculty
made
the
best
brew
in
the
college
enjoyed
little
drives
round
the
countryside
the
faculty
were
a
little
shy
of
inviting
him
in
a
lecture
he
got
an
immense
laugh
by
calling
queen
elizabeth
an
crock
he
then
laughed
above
all
the
rest
engels
noticed
mannerisms
the
constant
shifting
of
his
great
bulk
around
rotating
while
he
was
talking
flipping
his
eyeglasses
lumbering
on
to
the
stage
going
through
all
his
pockets
finally
finding
a
piece
of
dirty
yellow
paper
and
talking
from
it
as
if
most
laboriously
gathered
and
learned
notes
but
the
paper
was
only
for
show
father
burke
saw
him
get
out
of
the
cab
he
got
on
to
the
stair
landing
and
then
saw
yellow
paper
on
the
ground
he
had
delivered
his
whole
course
with
hardly
a
single
note
occasionally
looked
through
material
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
before
speaking
all
thought
him
a
great
entertainer
as
well
as
an
informing
talker
no
one
enjoyed
himself
more
than
he
did
trying
to
get
him
for
an
informal
gathering
they
mentioned
they
had
some
canadian
ales
quite
something
in
prohibition
days
the
ales
have
it
johnnie
he
chat
all
the
time
he
was
driving
father
leo
ward
the
problem
of
getting
to
and
fro
in
a
coupe
was
only
solved
by
backing
him
in
they
remembered
in
charley
big
chair
his
hands
barely
touching
over
his
great
expanse
they
recalled
that
on
receiving
his
honorary
degree
he
said
the
last
time
he
received
one
at
edinburgh
they
tapped
him
with
john
hat
he
did
not
expect
anything
so
drastic
here
perhaps
they
might
tap
him
with
tom
heflin
sombrero
when
he
had
been
invited
to
notre
dame
he
was
not
certain
where
it
was
but
with
a
name
like
that
even
if
it
were
in
the
mountains
of
the
moon
he
should
feel
at
home
if
i
ever
meet
anybody
who
suggests
there
something
calvinistic
or
puritanical
in
catholicism
i
shall
ask
you
ever
heard
of
the
university
of
notre
dame
tom
heflin
was
the
fiercely
senator
from
alabama
johnnie
he
do
anything
she
say
or
miss
collins
they
certainly
had
that
man
by
the
neck
but
they
took
wonderful
care
of
him
it
was
a
very
intelligent
arrangement
and
did
they
tidy
him
johnnie
very
much
so
it
was
their
business
every
evening
sister
madeleva
did
he
walk
on
the
campus
and
see
the
students
johnnie
he
did
walk
much
only
to
charlie
phillips
rooms
he
did
mind
being
a
little
late
but
his
lady
and
miss
collins
loaded
him
into
the
car
to
get
him
there
on
time
the
woman
they
lodged
with
used
to
swear
like
a
trooper
but
she
the
landlady
cried
like
a
kid
when
he
left
and
he
and
the
lady
seemed
lonesome
at
leaving
her
in
his
spare
time
at
the
house
he
would
be
drawing
some
fancy
stuff
what
did
he
talk
to
you
about
johnnie
he
just
talk
about
the
country
he
admire
the
streams
and
things
like
that
i
took
him
to
the
virgin
forest
and
i
could
hardly
get
him
back
he
even
got
out
to
notice
the
trees
he
spent
almost
an
hour
the
women
raved
at
me
and
said
i
must
get
him
back
at
a
certain
time
he
ask
me
the
names
of
the
trees
he
loved
rivers
and
would
ask
me
about
the
fish
at
one
time
father
thought
he
should
drive
to
chicago
or
some
big
town
but
he
did
care
for
towns
said
they
all
looked
alike
to
him
so
after
that
we
always
went
to
the
country
someone
asked
did
he
ever
get
grouchy
johnnie
he
always
had
a
smile
was
always
calling
kids
over
to
talk
to
him
he
touch
one
with
his
stick
to
make
him
look
round
and
play
with
him
and
then
he
laugh
himself
sick
playing
with
them
the
kids
were
always
around
him
the
ones
of
four
or
five
years
those
were
the
ones
he
notice
the
most
he
liked
to
ask
them
things
and
then
if
they
gave
a
good
answer
he
could
get
a
good
laugh
at
it
i
know
he
enjoyed
himself
here
i
met
him
in
ottawa
afterwards
he
was
autographing
a
book
the
pen
was
recalcitrant
and
he
shook
it
over
the
rug
me
i
always
cluttering
up
rugs
his
cousin
in
ottawa
had
him
completely
surrounded
by
ash
trays
but
the
cigar
had
ash
almost
half
length
and
it
was
falling
everywhere
father
ward
father
miltner
one
evening
in
pleasant
fall
weather
found
on
the
porch
the
campus
was
empty
he
got
a
grunt
in
return
to
his
greeting
tried
three
or
four
times
almost
no
answer
looked
glum
you
not
very
gay
this
evening
should
be
given
the
luxury
of
a
little
private
grouch
once
in
a
while
to
johnnie
did
he
take
the
lecture
business
seriously
no
he
just
wanted
five
minutes
on
the
porch
when
he
would
talk
to
no
one
but
the
kids
he
said
once
i
like
about
notes
is
that
when
once
you
begin
you
can
completely
disregard
them
he
stood
for
the
first
lecture
but
mostly
he
sat
he
enjoyed
a
joke
so
much
and
they
enjoyed
his
enjoyment
engels
for
the
first
lecture
he
stood
part
of
him
stood
behind
a
little
rostrum
after
that
he
sat
at
a
big
table
father
leo
ward
was
at
oxford
when
he
debated
that
the
law
is
a
hass
and
was
amazed
at
the
way
the
undergraduates
adored
him
his
opponent
begged
them
not
to
vote
for
at
this
critical
moment
in
the
world
history
they
cheered
but
voted
against
him
to
make
the
other
fellow
feel
good
sister
madeleva
what
did
he
do
for
recreation
johnnie
he
did
a
lot
of
sketching
i
guess
you
call
it
and
he
read
the
papers
sister
madeleva
did
he
like
the
campus
johnnie
very
much
did
he
ever
go
down
to
the
grotto
johnnie
he
seen
it
but
he
never
got
out
of
the
car
was
it
hard
for
him
to
walk
johnnie
no
he
could
walk
kinda
fast
but
it
was
so
hard
for
him
to
get
in
or
out
of
the
car
where
did
he
go
to
church
johnnie
he
came
here
to
notre
dame
he
was
close
to
lbs
but
he
never
give
it
away
he
break
an
ordinary
scale
i
guess
i
brought
him
under
the
main
building
he
got
stuck
in
the
door
of
the
car
father
tried
to
help
chesterton
said
it
reminded
him
of
an
old
irishwoman
do
you
get
out
sideways
have
no
sideways
to
the
debate
with
darrow
frances
taylor
patterson
had
gone
a
little
uneasy
lest
chesterton
arguments
might
seem
somewhat
literary
in
comparison
with
the
trained
scientific
mind
and
rapier
tongue
of
the
famous
trial
lawyer
she
found
however
that
both
trained
mind
and
rapier
tongue
were
the
property
of
i
have
never
heard
darrow
alone
but
taken
relatively
when
that
relativity
is
to
chesterton
he
appears
positively
muddle
headed
as
chesterton
summed
it
up
he
felt
as
if
darrow
had
been
arguing
all
afternoon
with
his
fundamentalist
aunt
and
simply
kept
sparring
with
a
dummy
of
his
own
mental
making
when
something
went
wrong
with
the
microphone
darrow
sat
back
until
it
could
be
fixed
whereupon
jumped
up
and
carried
on
in
his
natural
voice
science
you
see
is
not
infallible
chesterton
had
the
audience
with
him
from
the
start
and
when
it
was
over
everyone
just
sat
there
not
wishing
to
leave
they
were
loath
to
let
the
light
die
by
cyril
clemens
pp
as
in
england
so
also
in
the
states
gilbert
debating
was
held
to
be
far
better
than
his
straight
lecturing
he
never
missed
the
opportunity
for
a
quick
repartee
and
yet
when
he
scored
the
audience
felt
that
he
did
so
with
utter
kindness
at
a
debate
with
horace
bridges
of
the
ethical
cultural
society
on
is
psychology
a
curse
bishop
craig
stewart
who
presided
describes
how
in
his
closing
remarks
chesterton
devastatingly
sideswiped
his
opponent
and
wound
up
the
occasion
in
a
storm
of
laughter
and
applause
it
is
clear
that
i
have
won
the
debate
and
we
are
all
prepared
to
acknowledge
that
psychology
is
a
curse
let
us
however
be
magnanimous
let
us
allow
at
least
one
person
in
this
unhappy
world
to
practice
this
cursed
psychology
and
i
should
like
to
nominate
dr
bridges
the
bishop
on
another
occasion
introduced
gilbert
at
a
luncheon
in
chicago
by
quoting
oliver
herford
lines
when
plain
folks
such
as
you
and
i
see
the
sun
sinking
in
the
sky
we
think
it
is
the
setting
sun
but
gilbert
chesterton
is
not
so
easily
misled
he
calmly
stands
upon
his
head
and
upside
down
obtains
a
new
and
chestertonian
point
of
view
observing
thus
how
from
his
nose
the
sun
creeps
closer
to
his
toes
he
cries
in
wonder
and
delight
how
fine
the
sunrise
is
tonight
the
fact
that
nearly
all
the
headlines
he
chose
sounded
like
paradoxes
the
fact
that
they
did
not
themselves
agree
with
him
had
on
chesterton
opponents
and
on
some
members
of
his
audience
one
curious
effect
bridges
when
asked
his
opinion
of
his
late
sparring
partner
after
paying
warm
tribute
to
his
brilliance
as
a
critic
his
humour
and
his
great
personal
charm
discovered
in
his
subconscious
is
psychology
a
curse
a
certain
intellectual
recklessness
that
made
him
indifferent
to
truth
and
reality
fundamentally
perhaps
i
should
say
subconsciously
he
was
a
skeptic
and
acted
upon
the
principle
that
since
we
can
not
really
be
positive
about
anything
we
had
better
believe
what
it
pleases
us
to
believe
so
too
at
the
british
university
of
aberystwyth
when
chesterton
spoke
on
liberty
taking
first
historically
the
fights
of
barons
against
despots
yeomen
against
barons
factory
hands
against
owners
and
then
giving
as
a
modern
instance
the
fight
of
the
pedestrian
to
keep
the
liberty
of
the
highway
we
are
told
that
the
senior
history
lecturer
and
some
others
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
whole
thesis
of
the
address
was
a
gigantic
chesterton
must
have
seen
again
the
fixed
stare
on
the
faces
of
the
nottingham
tradesmen
thirty
years
earlier
on
the
famous
occasion
when
he
himself
got
up
and
played
with
water
but
that
earlier
audience
had
the
intellectual
advantage
over
the
university
professors
that
they
tried
to
find
out
what
he
meant
with
infinite
inquiring
gilbert
often
said
that
his
comic
illustrations
ought
not
to
have
prevented
this
but
it
was
really
more
his
inability
to
resist
making
himself
into
a
figure
of
fun
he
was
funny
and
the
jokes
were
funny
but
they
did
prevent
his
really
being
given
by
all
the
position
given
him
by
so
many
of
the
modern
johnson
it
is
possible
though
not
easy
to
imagine
johnson
dragged
from
the
station
to
his
hotel
by
forty
undergraduates
of
aberystwyth
while
members
of
the
secured
a
footing
on
the
carriage
armed
with
a
battle
axe
borrowed
from
the
arts
department
hoes
rakes
spades
their
officers
having
refused
them
the
privilege
of
bearing
arms
on
the
occasion
but
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
the
doctor
called
upon
for
a
speech
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
and
saying
you
need
never
be
ashamed
of
the
athletic
prowess
of
this
college
the
pyramids
we
are
told
were
built
by
slave
labour
but
the
slaves
were
not
expected
to
haul
the
pyramids
in
one
piece
by
cyril
clemens
p
in
san
francisco
i
saw
many
people
who
had
met
gilbert
including
a
journalist
who
took
him
to
a
bootleg
joint
which
is
western
for
a
speakeasy
there
he
asked
for
some
specialty
of
the
house
and
was
offered
a
mule
six
of
these
babies
will
put
you
on
your
ear
remarked
the
bartender
what
did
he
say
about
my
ear
gilbert
queried
he
downed
three
of
the
potent
mixture
in
spite
of
his
theory
against
cocktails
and
his
host
remarked
his
continued
poise
with
admiration
while
the
bartender
commented
he
can
take
it
another
slang
expression
that
appeared
to
be
new
to
gilbert
he
told
his
host
williams
that
he
delighted
in
meeting
such
folk
as
bartenders
and
all
the
simpler
people
whom
he
saw
too
seldom
this
suggested
an
idea
would
he
come
out
to
a
school
across
the
bay
which
could
not
afford
his
fees
because
it
educated
the
daughters
of
poorer
catholics
he
agreed
at
once
and
not
only
talked
to
them
brilliantly
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
but
also
wrote
for
the
children
about
autographs
but
of
course
he
had
forgotten
something
an
engagement
to
attend
a
big
social
function
a
huge
car
arrived
at
the
school
complete
with
chauffeur
and
several
agitated
ladies
chesterton
you
have
broken
an
important
engagement
i
have
filled
an
important
engagement
he
answered
lecturing
to
the
daughters
of
the
poor
if
it
were
possible
for
gilbert
to
be
better
loved
anywhere
than
in
england
that
anywhere
was
certainly
america
from
coast
to
coast
i
have
met
his
devotees
i
have
come
across
only
one
expression
of
the
opposite
feeling
and
that
from
a
man
who
seems
from
his
opening
sentence
to
have
been
unable
to
stay
away
from
the
lectures
he
so
detested
i
heard
chesterton
some
six
or
seven
times
in
this
country
his
physical
repelled
me
he
looked
like
a
big
eater
and
animalism
is
repugnant
to
most
of
us
his
appearance
was
against
him
not
one
of
his
lectures
seemed
to
me
worth
the
price
of
admission
and
some
of
them
were
so
bad
that
they
seemed
contemptuous
morsels
flung
at
audiences
for
whom
he
adjudged
anything
good
enough
one
of
his
lectures
at
the
academy
brooklyn
was
a
great
disappointment
and
he
charged
for
it
it
was
not
worth
and
chesterton
knew
it
after
the
lecture
he
remarked
to
a
friend
of
mine
i
think
that
was
the
worst
lecture
i
ever
gave
he
may
have
been
right
certainly
it
was
the
worst
i
ever
heard
him
give
but
he
took
the
thousand
and
a
bonus
of
for
the
extra
large
crowd
in
attendance
no
i
did
not
like
chesterton
what
of
the
money
with
his
american
agent
chesterton
had
a
quite
usual
arrangement
he
received
half
the
fees
paid
the
agent
made
engagements
paid
travelling
expenses
and
received
for
this
the
other
half
out
of
the
half
chesterton
received
he
paid
a
further
ten
per
cent
to
the
london
agent
who
had
introduced
him
to
the
american
agent
he
also
had
to
pay
the
expenses
of
his
wife
and
his
secretary
and
further
gave
a
large
present
to
his
secretary
for
her
trouble
on
the
tour
the
rest
went
chiefly
into
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
told
anyone
at
what
figure
the
original
fee
stood
for
any
lecture
one
of
the
basilian
fathers
then
a
novice
remembers
appearance
in
toronto
the
subject
of
this
lecture
was
culture
and
the
coming
peril
the
coming
peril
he
explained
was
not
bolshevism
because
bolshevism
had
now
been
tried
the
best
way
to
destroy
a
utopia
is
to
establish
it
the
net
result
of
bolshevism
is
that
the
modern
world
will
not
imitate
it
nor
by
coming
peril
did
he
mean
another
great
war
the
next
great
war
he
added
would
happen
when
germany
tried
to
monkey
about
with
the
frontiers
of
poland
the
coming
peril
was
the
intellectual
educational
psychological
artistic
overproduction
which
equally
with
economic
overproduction
threatened
the
of
contemporary
civilisation
people
were
inundated
blinded
deafened
and
mentally
paralysed
by
a
flood
of
vulgar
and
tasteless
externals
leaving
them
no
time
for
leisure
thought
or
creation
from
within
themselves
at
question
period

why

next

please
how
tall
are
you
and
what
do
you

i
am
six
feet

inches
but
my
weight
has
never
been
accurately
calculated
is
george
bernard
shaw
a
coming
peril
heavens
no
he
is
a
disappearing
pleasure
for
an
apparently
haphazard
collection
of
essays
on
new
london
and
newer
published
on
his
return
to
england
from
the
second
visit
has
a
surprising
unity
blitzed
in
london
and
out
of
print
in
new
york
it
is
now
hard
to
obtain
which
is
a
pity
as
it
is
full
of
good
things
discussing
the
fashions
of
today
chesterton
attempts
to
remove
these
things
from
the
test
of
time
and
subject
them
to
the
test
of
truth
and
this
rule
of
an
eternal
test
is
the
one
he
tried
to
apply
in
all
his
comments
obviously
nothing
human
is
perfect
and
this
includes
the
human
judgment
even
judgment
talking
of
the
past
or
of
the
present
of
england
or
america
he
may
often
have
been
wrong
and
he
would
certainly
have
been
the
last
man
to
claim
infallibility
for
his
judgments
his
weakness
as
a
critic
was
perhaps
a
tendency
to
get
his
proportions
wrong
to
make
too
much
of
some
things
he
saw
or
experienced
to
little
of
others
his
qualities
were
intellectual
curiosity
and
personal
amiability
together
with
the
measuring
rod
of
an
eternal
standard
this
second
visit
to
america
only
deepened
in
gilbert
mind
many
of
the
impressions
made
by
the
first
yet
the
atmosphere
of
the
book
is
curiously
different
from
that
of
i
saw
in
living
in
the
country
even
a
few
months
had
so
greatly
deepened
his
understanding
he
still
preferred
the
quakers
to
the
puritans
the
essential
of
the
puritan
mood
is
the
misdirection
of
moral
anger
he
still
felt
that
as
a
whole
the
united
states
had
started
with
a
great
political
idea
but
a
small
spiritual
idea
that
it
needed
a
return
to
the
vision
in
politics
and
sociology
it
was
the
fashion
today
to
laugh
at
the
wish
for
great
open
spaces
yet
the
real
sociological
object
in
going
to
america
was
to
find
those
open
spaces
it
was
not
to
find
more
engineers
and
electric
batteries
and
mechanical
gadgets
in
the
home
these
may
have
been
the
result
of
america
they
were
not
the
causes
of
america
asked
why
he
admired
america
yet
hated
americanisation
he
replied
i
should
have
thought
that
i
had
earned
some
right
to
apply
this
obvious
distinction
to
any
foreign
country
since
i
have
consistently
applied
it
to
my
own
country
if
the
egoism
is
excusable
i
am
myself
an
englishman
which
some
identify
with
an
egoist
and
i
have
done
my
best
to
praise
and
glorify
a
number
of
english
things
english
inns
english
roads
english
jokes
and
jokers
even
to
the
point
of
praising
the
roads
for
being
crooked
or
the
humour
for
being
cockney
but
i
have
invariably
written
ever
since
i
have
written
at
all
against
the
cult
of
british
imperialism
and
when
that
perilous
power
and
opportunity
which
is
given
by
wealth
and
worldly
success
largely
passed
from
the
british
empire
to
the
united
states
i
have
applied
exactly
the
same
principle
to
the
united
states
i
think
that
imperialism
is
none
the
less
imperialism
because
it
is
spread
by
economic
pressure
or
snobbish
fashion
rather
than
by
conquest
indeed
i
have
much
more
respect
for
the
empire
that
is
spread
by
fighting
than
for
the
empire
that
is
spread
by
finance
on
new
london
newer
p
he
felt
that
the
real
causes
for
admiration
the
real
greatness
of
america
could
be
found
partly
through
facing
its
incompleteness
and
defects
partly
through
contemplating
the
character
of
the
greatest
and
most
typical
of
americans
abraham
lincoln
whilst
i
was
in
america
i
often
lingered
in
small
towns
and
wayside
places
and
in
a
curious
and
almost
creepy
fashion
the
great
presence
of
abraham
lincoln
continually
grew
upon
me
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
linger
a
little
in
america
and
especially
in
what
many
would
call
the
most
uninteresting
or
unpleasing
parts
of
america
before
this
strong
sense
of
a
strange
kind
of
greatness
can
grow
upon
the
soul
the
externals
of
the
middle
west
affect
an
englishman
as
ugly
and
yet
ugliness
is
not
exactly
the
point
there
are
things
in
england
that
are
quite
as
ugly
or
even
uglier
rows
of
red
brick
villas
in
the
suburbs
of
a
town
in
the
midlands
are
one
would
suppose
as
hideous
as
human
could
invent
or
endure
but
they
are
different
they
are
complete
they
are
in
their
way
compact
rounded
and
finished
with
an
effect
that
may
be
prim
or
smug
but
is
not
raw
the
surroundings
of
them
are
neat
if
it
be
in
a
niggling
fashion
but
american
ugliness
is
not
complete
even
as
ugliness
it
is
broken
off
short
it
is
ragged
at
the
edges
even
its
worthy
objects
have
around
them
a
sort
of
halo
of
refuse
somebody
said
of
the
rugged
and
sardonic
temple
once
archbishop
of
canterbury
there
are
no
polished
corners
in
our
temple
there
are
no
polished
corners
even
in
the
great
american
cities
which
are
full
of
fine
and
stately
classical
buildings
not
unworthy
to
be
compared
to
temples
nobody
seems
to
mind
the
juxtaposition
of
unsightly
things
and
important
things
there
is
some
deep
difference
of
feeling
about
the
need
for
completeness
and
harmony
and
there
is
the
same
thing
in
the
political
and
ethical
life
of
the
great
western
nation
it
was
out
of
this
landscape
that
the
great
president
came
and
one
might
almost
trace
a
fanciful
shadow
of
his
figure
in
the
thin
trees
and
the
stiff
wooden
pillars
a
man
of
any
imagination
might
look
down
these
strange
streets
with
their
filled
with
the
latest
conveniences
and
surrounded
with
the
latest
litter
till
he
could
see
approaching
down
the
long
perspective
that
long
ungainly
figure
with
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
rustic
umbrella
and
deep
melancholy
eyes
the
humour
and
the
hard
patience
and
the
heart
that
fed
upon
hope
deferred
that
is
admiring
abraham
lincoln
and
that
is
admiring
america
pp
among
the
stately
and
classical
buildings
were
those
making
up
the
university
of
notre
dame
where
he
had
been
lecturing
and
which
turned
his
musings
in
a
direction
they
were
ever
inclined
to
take
founded
by
a
group
of
frenchmen
a
century
ago
with
a
capital
of
four
hundred
dollars
in
a
small
log
building
on
a
clearing
of
ten
acres
the
university
today
numbers
buildings
on
a
seventeen
hundred
acre
campus
the
gold
dome
of
the
church
visible
from
miles
away
the
interesting
combination
of
the
extraordinary
fame
of
its
football
team
with
a
keen
spiritual
life
especially
fascinated
gilbert
he
wrote
a
poem
dedicated
to
the
university
and
called
the
arena
in
it
he
pictures
first
the
golden
image
on
the
gilded
house
of
nero
that
stood
for
all
the
horrors
of
the
pagan
amphitheatre
then
comes
in
contrast
another
image
i
have
seen
where
a
strange
country
opened
its
secret
plains
about
me
one
great
golden
dome
stand
lonely
with
its
golden
image
one
seen
afar
in
strange
fulfilment
through
the
sunlit
indian
summer
that
apocalyptic
portent
that
has
clothed
her
with
the
sun
the
boys
shout
notre
dame
as
they
watch
the
fortunes
of
the
fray
and
chesterton
sees
our
lady
presiding
fittingly
even
over
a
football
contest
and
i
saw
them
shock
the
whirlwind
of
the
world
of
dust
and
dazzle
and
thrice
they
stamped
a
thunderclap
and
thrice
the
swirled
and
thrice
they
cried
like
thunder
on
our
lady
of
the
victories
the
mother
of
the
master
of
the
masterers
of
the
world
he
recurs
to
a
favourite
thought
that
the
mother
of
sorrows
is
the
cause
of
human
joy
queen
of
death
and
deadly
weeping
those
about
to
live
salute

holier

since
the
queen
of
sevenfold
sorrow

brought
joy
upon
the
earth
no
wonder
that
as
johnnie
mangan
said
you
could
not
drag
him
away
from
the
game
if
the
game
meant
also
a
meditation
the
holier
bread
came
perhaps
to
his
mind
from
the
fact
that
the
average
of
daily
communion
is
unusually
high
at
notre
dame
when
he
desired
for
americans
a
return
to
their
great
political
vision
he
desired
also
an
opening
of
the
eyes
to
that
greater
spiritual
vision
which
was
to
him
the
supreme
opportunity
of
the
human
spirit

on
the
absence
of
any
reference
to
universities
in
i
saw
in
nor
have
i
anywhere
found
any
discussion
by
chesterton
of
the
intellectual
quality
of
catholic
education
any
comparison
with
the
secular
teaching
either
in
england
or
in
america
but
that
the
problems
of
these
two
countries
and
of
all
the
world
could
be
solved
only
by
what
that
golden
dome
housed
he
cried
with
no
uncertain
voice

is
in
the
world
around

virtue
that
i
know
of
i
could
really
forgive
unto
seventy
times
the
notebook
one
of
the
commonest
of
biographers
problems
is
the
question
of
quarrels
and
broken
friendships
at
the
distance
of
time
separating
a
life
from
its
record
some
of
these
look
so
empty
of
meaning
as
to
imperil
any
reputation
yet
they
happened
and
when
they
were
happening
they
probably
appeared
full
of
significance
other
quarrels
involve
issues
of
importance
in
which
the
biographer
can
not
take
wholeheartedly
the
side
of
his
hero
thus
my
own
father
writing
father
life
had
to
pronounce
judgment
on
newman
side
in
the
issues
that
divided
them
yet
later
writing
newman
biography
he
had
to
admit
the
faults
of
temper
that
at
least
weakened
the
cardinal
case
for
only
so
could
he
tell
an
entirely
truthful
story
in
chesterton
life
there
is
no
such
problem
attacks
on
public
characters
in
his
paper
attacks
on
abuses
and
ideas
absorbed
all
his
pugnacity
fellow
writers
rival
journalists
friends
furnished
often
enough
material
for
a
quarrel
but
chesterton
would
never
take
it
up
he
excelled
in
the
soft
answer
not
that
answer
which
seeming
soft
subtly
provokes
to
wrath
but
the
genuine
article
belloc
said
of
him
that
he
possessed
the
two
virtues
of
humility
and
charity
those
most
royal
of
all
christian
virtues
in
the
heat
of
argument
he
retained
a
fairness
of
mind
that
saw
his
opponent
case
and
would
never
turn
an
argument
into
a
quarrel
and
most
people
both
liked
him
and
felt
that
he
liked
them
while
he
was
having
his
great
controversy
with
blatchford
back
in
it
is
clear
from
letters
between
them
that
the
two
men
remained
on
the
friendliest
terms
edward
macdonald
writes
of
his
experiences
of
chesterton
when
he
was
working
with
him
on
the
paper
he
loved
all
the
jokes
about
his
size
he
was
the
first
to
see
the
point
and
to
roar
with
laughter
when
douglas
woodruff
introduced
him
to
a
meeting
as
chesterton
who
has
just
been
looking
round
in
america
he
came
into
the
office
once
on
press
day
and
saw
the
disordered
pile
of
papers
and
proofs
on
my
desk
the
place
was
certainly
in
an
awful
mess
i
wanted
to
show
him
a
particular
letter
and
shoved
my
hand
into
the
middle
of
one
pile
and
was
lucky
enough
to
put
my
hand
right
on
the
right
document
complimented
me
on
a
filing
system
that
demanded
a
keen
memory
and
then
remarked
enviously
i
wish
they
let
me
have
a
desk
like
that
at
home
when
thomas
derrick
drew
his
famous
cartoon
of
milking
a
cow
he
hesitated
to
give
it
to
me
for
fear
that
would
be
offended
i
wanted
to
print
it
in
a
special
number
and
telephoned
to
beaconsfield
chesterton
i
have
here
a
cartoon
of
derrick
and
would
like
to
put
it
in
the
special
number
but
as
you
are
the
subject
of
the
cartoon
derrick
is
afraid
you
may
not
like
it
i
would
rather
it
were
not
printed
he
replied
i
never
liked
the
idea
of
my
name
being
used
in
the
title
of
the
paper
and
want
but
embarrassing
personalities
of
course
if
it
were
highly
satirical
insulting
and
otherwise
unflattering
gladly
have
it
on
the
i
assured
him
that
it
was
anything
but
flattering
and
on
the
it
went
it
was
used
as
the
frontispiece
of
miscellany
many
of
the
obituary
writers
said
that
he
hated
the
cinema
in
fact
he
told
me
once
that
he
had
long
wished
to
write
a
new
translation
of
cyrano
and
would
like
to
try
his
hand
at
a
film
scenario
of
the
play
his
fingers
had
itched
in
the
first
place
to
retranslate
the
duel
scene
in
order
to
restore
the
strength
of
the
ballade
in
english
when
he
saw
the
film
version
of
a
father
brown
story
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
he
had
liked
the
film
as
a
film
and
the
acting
he
added
as
an
afterthought
it
gave
me
an
idea
for
a
new
father
brown
story
a
note
was
taken
of
the
famous
debate
with
bernard
shaw
it
was
decided
to
devote
four
pages
of
to
a
report
which
i
tried
to
compile
by
avoiding
the
third
person
and
concentrating
on
significant
quotations
but
whereas
shaw
put
his
points
in
a
few
words
from
which
elaboration
could
be
cut
argument
was
so
closely
knit
that
it
was
difficult
to
leave
out
passages
without
spoiling
the
effect
he
walked
into
the
room
as
my
pencil
went
through
a
fairly
long
extract
from
shaw
speech
and
whose
words
are
you
so
gaily
murdering
he
asked
shaw
mr
chesterton
very
well
now
put
them
all
back
and
murder
mine
i
refuse
to
deny
shaw
a
full
opportunity
to
state
his
case
in
my
paper
as
a
result
shaw
speech
took
up
a
great
part
of
the
space
allotted
and
was
inadequately
reported
he
was
always
careful
if
he
had
reviewed
a
book
in
the
paper
criticising
its
ideas
to
take
an
immediate
opportunity
to
show
the
author
his
warm
personal
friendliness
middleton
murry
sending
him
a
book
of
his
own
criticised
as
perverse
for
thinking
communism
and
capitalism
alike
your
clean
idea
of
liberty
and
property
delights
me
i
believe
quite
as
much
as
it
does
you
but
it
is
a
vision
and
a
dream
in
this
capitalistic
world
the
communist
is
the
man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
to
go
through
with
the
grim
business
of
capitalism
to
the
bitter
end
because
he
knows
there
is
no
going
back
he
makes
a
choice
between
following
a
dream
which
he
is
only
a
dream
and
following
a
hope
which
he
knows
his
own
devotion
may
help
to
make
real
communism
is
the
faith
which
a
man
wins
through
blank
and
utter
despair
for
my
own
part
if
it
were
possible
i
would
rather
see
the
world
converted
to
christianity
than
to
communism
but
the
world
has
had
its
chance
of
becoming
christian
it
will
not
get
it
again
the
wrath
to
come
that
is
what
communism
is
and
we
can
flee
from
it
only
by
repentance
and
repentance
itself
means
communism
that
is
the
fact
as
i
see
it
i
hope
and
sometimes
dream
that
we
shall
have
the
communism
of
repentance
and
not
the
communism
of
wrath
here
in
england
chesterton
replied
may
thank
you
so
very
much
for
your
most
interesting
and
generous
letter
which
reached
me
indirectly
and
was
delayed
also
for
your
most
interesting
and
generous
book
which
i
immediately
sat
down
and
read
at
a
sitting
which
in
its
turn
so
stimulated
me
that
i
immediately
wrote
a
rapid
and
rather
curt
reply
for
my
own
little
rag
i
fear
you
will
find
the
reply
more
controversial
than
i
meant
it
to
be
for
your
book
is
so
packed
with
challenges
that
i
could
not
but
make
my
very
short
article
a
thing
packed
with
mere
repartees
but
i
do
hope
you
will
understand
how
warm
a
sympathy
i
have
with
very
much
of
what
you
say
and
with
all
the
motives
with
which
you
say
it
needless
to
say
i
agree
with
every
word
you
say
against
capitalism
but
i
particularly
want
to
congratulate
you
on
what
you
say
about
parasitic
parliamentary
labour
i
thought
that
chapter
was
quite
triumphant
as
for
the
rest
it
is
true
that
it
has
not
shaken
me
in
my
conviction
that
the
catholic
church
is
larger
than
you
or
me
than
your
moods
or
mine
and
the
heroic
but
destructive
mood
in
which
you
write
is
a
very
good
example
you
say
that
christ
set
the
example
of
a
which
seems
to
me
almost
nihihist
but
i
will
never
deny
that
catholics
have
saluted
that
mood
as
the
imitation
of
christ
lately
a
friend
of
mine
young
virile
handsome
happily
circumstanced
walked
straight
off
and
buried
himself
in
a
monastery
never
so
to
speak
to
reappear
on
earth
why
did
he
do
it
psychologically
i
can
not
imagine
not
certainly
from
fear
of
hell
or
wish
to
be
rewarded
by
heaven
as
an
instructed
catholic
he
knew
as
well
as
i
do
that
he
could
save
his
soul
by
normal
living
i
can
only
suppose
that
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
that
christ
and
others
do
accept
a
violent
reversal
of
all
normal
things
but
why
do
you
say
that
christ
did
it
and
has
left
no
christians
who
do
it
our
church
has
stood
in
the
derision
of
four
hundred
years
because
there
were
still
christians
who
did
it
and
they
did
it
to
themselves
as
christ
did
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
if
i
say
that
this
is
different
from
throwing
out
a
violent
theory
for
other
people
to
follow
now
for
the
application
some
of
these
monks
less
cloistered
are
to
my
knowledge
helping
the
english
people
to
get
back
to
the
ownership
of
their
own
land
renewing
agriculture
as
they
did
in
the
dark
ages
why
do
you
say
there
is
no
chance
for
this
normal
property
and
liberty
you
can
only
mean
to
say
of
our
scheme
exactly
what
you
yourself
admit
about
the
communist
scheme
that
it
requires
awful
and
almost
inhuman
sacrifices
that
we
must
turn
the
mind
that
we
must
alter
the
whole
psychology
of
modern
englishmen
we
must
do
that
to
make
them
communists
why
is
it
an
answer
to
say
we
must
do
that
to
make
them
distributists
i
could
point
out
many
ways
in
which
our
ideal
is
nearer
and
more
native
to
men
but
i
will
not
prolong
this
debate
i
should
be
very
sorry
that
you
should
think
it
is
only
a
debate
i
only
ask
you
to
believe
that
we
sympathise
where
we
do
not
agree
but
on
this
we
do
not
agree
murry
wrote
later
of
gilbert
i
liked
the
man
immensely
and
he
was
a
very
honourable
opponent
of
mine
much
the
most
honourable
i
ever
encountered
mark
twain
quarterly
chesterton
memorial
no
was
of
course
gilbert
own
platform
so
perhaps
his
care
to
apologise
and
his
great
magnanimity
are
more
remarkable
in
incidents
outside
its
columns
eliot
had
his
platform
he
edited
the
chesterton
on
being
reproached
by
him
for
a
hasty
article
not
only
apologised
but
dedicated
a
book
to
eliot
he
had
written
confusing
him
with
another
critic
who
disapproved
of
alliteration
and
had
also
misquoted
a
stanza
of
his
poetry
eliot
had
written
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
it
was
apparently
your
sympathetic
reviewer
not
i
who
made
the
remark
about
alliteration
to
which
it
seems
he
added
a
more
general
criticism
of
mine
so
that
is
not
the
right
corrective
some
of
your
comments
seem
to
be
based
on
a
belief
that
i
object
to
alliteration
and
may
i
add
as
a
humble
versifier
that
i
my
verse
to
be
quoted
correctly
if
at
all
chesterton
replied
i
am
so
very
sorry
if
my
nonsense
in
the
had
any
general
air
of
hostility
to
say
nothing
of
any
incidental
injustices
of
which
i
was
quite
unaware
i
meant
it
to
be
quite
amiable
like
the
tremulous
badinage
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
in
the
bar
parlour
when
he
has
been
guyed
by
the
brighter
lads
of
the
village
i
can
not
imagine
that
i
ever
said
anything
about
you
or
any
particular
person
being
a
snob
for
it
was
quite
out
of
my
thoughts
and
too
serious
for
the
whole
affair
i
certainly
did
have
the
impression
from
the
way
the
reviewer
put
it
that
you
disapproved
of
my
alliteration
i
also
added
that
you
would
be
quite
right
if
you
did
i
certainly
did
quote
you
from
memory
and
even
quote
from
a
quotation
i
also
mentioned
that
i
was
doing
so
casual
a
thing
of
course
on
the
strictest
principles
all
quotations
should
be
verified
and
i
should
certainly
have
done
so
if
i
had
in
any
way
resented
anything
you
said
or
been
myself
writing
in
a
spirit
of
resentment
if
you
think
a
letter
to
the
clearing
up
these
points
would
be
fairer
to
everybody
of
course
i
should
be
delighted
to
write
one
this
attitude
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
was
the
chestertonian
fashion
of
accepting
the
youthful
demand
for
something
new
when
a
young
writer
in
alluded
to
him
as
out
of
date
he
took
it
with
the
utmost
placidity
good
he
said
to
edward
macdonald
i
like
to
see
people
refusing
to
accept
the
opinions
of
others
before
they
examined
them
themselves
they
perfectly
entitled
to
say
that
i
not
a
literary
lion
but
a
landseer
lion
eliot
answer
was
a
request
to
gilbert
to
write
in
the
and
an
explanation
that
he
had
felt
in
a
false
position
since
he
rather
liked
alliteration
than
otherwise
thus
too
when
chesterton
had
answered
a
newspaper
report
of
a
speech
made
by
joad
the
latter
complained
that
it
was
a
criticism
not
of
anything
that
i
think
but
of
a
garbled
newspaper
caricature
of
a
few
of
the
things
i
think
taken
out
of
their
context
and
falsified
he
added
that
he
had
not
said
science
would
destroy
religion
but
that
at
its
present
rate
of
decline
the
of
would
become
a
dead
letter
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
next
that
science
has
no
bearing
upon
the
spiritual
truths
of
religion
but
has
been
presented
at
any
rate
by
the
church
of
england
in
a
texture
of
obsolete
ideas
about
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
and
the
behaviour
of
physical
things
which
science
has
shown
to
be
untrue
finally
that
religion
is
vital
but
it
is
in
mysticism
that
the
core
of
religion
lies
for
me
and
mystical
experience
as
i
understand
it
does
not
want
organizing
i
may
be
wrong
in
all
this
but
i
hope
that
this
explanation
such
as
it
is
will
lead
you
to
think
that
i
am
not
such
an
arrogant
fool
as
your
article
suggests
chesterton
replied
may
i
hope
you
will
forgive
my
delay
in
thanking
you
for
your
very
valuable
and
reasonable
letter
but
i
have
been
away
from
home
and
for
various
reasons
my
correspondence
has
accumulated
very
heavily
i
am
extremely
glad
to
remember
that
even
before
receiving
your
letter
i
was
careful
to
say
in
my
article
that
my
quarrel
was
not
personally
with
you
but
with
the
newspapers
which
had
used
what
you
said
as
a
part
of
a
stupid
stunt
against
organised
religion
i
am
even
more
glad
to
learn
that
they
had
misused
your
name
and
used
what
you
did
not
say
i
ought
to
have
known
by
this
time
that
they
are
quite
capable
of
it
and
i
entirely
agree
that
the
correction
you
make
in
the
report
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
do
not
think
i
ever
meant
or
said
that
you
were
an
arrogant
fool
or
anything
like
it
but
most
certainly
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
religion
will
die
in
a
century
as
the
report
stated
and
quite
another
to
say
that
the
church
of
england
will
experience
a
certain
rate
of
decline
whether
the
prediction
be
true
or
no
i
shall
certainly
take
some
opportunity
to
correct
my
statement
prominently
in
the
london
i
hope
i
should
do
so
in
any
case
but
in
this
case
it
supports
my
main
actual
contention
that
there
is
in
the
press
a
very
vulgar
and
unscrupulous
attack
on
the
historic
christian
church
the
four
points
you
raise
are
so
interesting
that
i
feel
i
ought
to
touch
on
them
though
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
do
so
rather
rapidly
with
the
first
i
have
already
dealt
and
in
that
matter
i
can
only
apologise
both
for
myself
and
my
unfortunate
profession
and
touching
the
second
i
do
not
suppose
we
should
greatly
disagree
i
merely
used
it
as
one
example
of
the
futility
of
fatalistic
prophecies
such
as
the
one
attributed
by
the
newspapers
to
you
but
a
thorough
debate
between
us
if
there
were
time
for
it
touching
the
third
and
fourth
points
might
possibly
remove
our
differences
but
would
certainly
reveal
them
in
the
third
paragraph
you
say
something
that
has
been
said
many
times
and
doubtless
means
something
but
i
can
say
quite
honestly
that
i
have
never
been
quite
certain
of
what
it
means
naturally
i
hold
no
brief
for
the
church
of
england
as
such
indeed
i
am
inclined
to
congratulate
you
on
having
found
any
one
positive
set
of
ideas
obsolete
or
not
which
that
church
is
solidly
agreed
in
presenting
but
i
have
been
a
member
of
that
church
myself
and
in
justice
to
it
i
must
say
that
neither
then
nor
now
did
i
see
clearly
what
are
these
things
about
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
which
science
has
shown
to
be
untrue
i
was
not
required
as
an
anglican
any
more
than
as
a
catholic
to
believe
that
god
had
two
hands
and
ten
fingers
to
mould
adam
from
clay
but
even
if
i
had
been
it
would
be
rather
difficult
to
define
the
scientific
discovery
that
makes
it
impossible
i
should
like
to
see
the
defined
christian
dogma
written
down
and
the
final
scientific
discovery
written
against
it
i
have
never
seen
this
yet
what
i
have
seen
is
that
even
the
greatest
scientific
dogmas
are
not
final
we
have
just
this
moment
agreed
that
the
ideas
of
the
physical
universe
which
are
really
and
truly
obsolete
are
the
very
ideas
taught
by
physicists
thirty
years
ago
what
i
think
you
mean
is
that
science
has
shown
to
be
untrue
but
miracles
are
not
ideas
about
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
they
are
ideas
about
the
nature
of
a
power
capable
of
breaking
through
the
nature
of
the
physical
universe
and
science
has
not
shown
that
to
be
untrue
for
anybody
who
can
think
lastly
you
say
that
it
is
indeed
necessary
that
religion
should
exist
but
that
its
essence
is
mysticism
and
this
does
not
need
to
be
organised
i
should
answer
that
nothing
on
earth
needs
to
be
organised
so
much
as
mysticism
you
say
that
man
tends
naturally
to
religion
he
does
indeed
often
in
the
form
of
human
sacrifice
or
the
temples
of
sodom
almost
all
extreme
evil
of
that
kind
is
mystical
the
only
way
of
keeping
it
healthy
is
to
have
some
rules
some
responsibilities
some
definitions
of
dogma
and
moral
function
that
at
least
as
you
yourself
put
it
is
what
i
think
and
i
hope
you
will
not
blame
me
for
saying
so
but
as
to
what
i
said
in
that
particular
article
it
was
quite
clearly
written
upon
wrong
information
and
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
do
my
best
to
publish
the
fact
in
any
such
argument
gilbert
was
never
in
the
words
of
the
gospel
willing
to
justify
himself
he
only
wanted
to
justify
certain
ideas
and
the
thought
of
having
misrepresented
anyone
else
was
distressing
to
him
even
the
hardened
controversialist
coulton
wrote
in
the
course
of
one
of
their
arguments
if
i
speak
very
plainly
of
your
historical
methods
it
is
not
that
i
do
not
fully
respect
your
conversion
i
have
more
sympathy
with
your
catholicity
than
partly
no
doubt
by
my
own
fault
you
may
be
inclined
to
think
i
believe
you
to
have
made
a
sacrifice
of
the
sort
that
is
never
altogether
vain
it
is
therefore
part
of
my
faith
that
you
are
near
to
that
which
i
also
am
trying
to
approach
and
if
this
belief
does
little
or
nothing
to
colour
my
criticisms
in
this
particular
discussion
that
is
because
i
believe
true
catholicism
like
true
protestantism
can
only
gain
by
the
explosion
of
historical
falsehoods
if
indeed
they
be
false
with
the
least
possible
delay
if
on
the
other
hand
they
are
truths
then
you
may
be
trusted
to
make
out
the
best
possible
case
for
them
and
my
words
will
recoil
upon
myself
the
dispute
was
about
puritanism
and
catholicism
it
was
republished
as
a
pamphlet
it
is
the
only
case
i
have
found
in
which
chesterton
wrote
several
versions
of
one
letter
to
the
in
its
final
form
he
omitted
one
illuminating
illustration
coulton
had
maintained
that
the
mediaevals
condemned
dancing
as
much
as
the
puritans
and
had
dug
up
various
mouldy
theologians
who
classed
it
as
a
mortal
sin
father
lopez
retorted
by
a
quotation
from
thomas
saying
it
was
quite
right
to
dance
at
weddings
and
on
such
like
occasions
provided
the
dancing
was
of
a
decent
kind
chesterton
comments
we
have
already
travelled
very
far
from
the
first
vision
of
coulton
of
dark
ages
full
of
one
monotonous
wail
over
the
mortal
sin
of
dancing
to
class
it
seriously
as
a
mortal
sin
is
to
class
it
with
adultery
or
theft
or
murder
it
is
interesting
to
imagine
thomas
and
the
moderate
moralists
saying
you
may
murder
at
weddings
you
may
commit
adultery
to
celebrate
your
release
from
prison
you
may
steal
if
you
do
not
do
it
with
immodest
gestures
and
so
on
the
calm
tone
of
thomas
about
the
whole
thing
is
alone
evidence
of
a
social
atmosphere
different
from
that
described
the
rest
of
his
analysis
of
coulton
method
of
dealing
with
a
historical
document
and
distorting
it
is
in
the
published
version
a
valuable
part
of
chesterton
line
is
also
interesting
as
a
comment
on
his
own
historical
work
the
expert
he
says
is
so
occupied
with
detail
that
he
overlooks
the
broad
facts
that
anyone
could
see
on
this
point
the
review
of
coulton
mediaeval
history
in
the
is
illuminating
the
reviewer
noted
that
in
the
index
under
the
word
church
occurred
such
notes
as
soldiers
sleeping
in
horses
stabled
in
and
other
allusions
to
extraordinary
happenings
but
nowhere
he
said
could
he
find
any
mention
of
the
normal
use
of
a
church
that
men
prayed
in
it
with
wells
several
interchanges
of
letters
have
shown
in
earlier
chapters
how
the
soft
answer
turned
aside
a
wrath
easily
aroused
but
also
easily
dissipated
another
exchange
of
letters
only
three
years
before
gilbert
death
must
be
given
the
third
letter
is
undated
and
i
am
not
sure

dear

xmas
cutting
comes
like
the
greetings
if
after
all
my
atheology
turns
out
wrong
and
your
theology
right
i
feel
i
shall
always
be
able
to
pass
into
heaven
if
i
want
to
as
a
friend
of
bless
you
my
warmest
good
wishes
to
you
and
my
dear
i
do
hope
my
secretary
let
you
know
that
at
the
moment
when
i
got
your
most
welcome
note
i
was
temporarily
laid
out
in
bed
and
able
to
appreciate
it
but
not
to
acknowledge
it
as
to
the
fine
point
of
theology
you
raise
i
am
content
to
answer
with
the
subtle
and
exquisite
irony
of
the
yanks
i
should
worry
if
i
turn
out
to
be
right
you
will
triumph
not
by
being
a
friend
of
mine
but
by
being
a
friend
of
man
by
having
done
a
thousand
things
for
men
like
me
in
every
way
from
imagination
to
criticism
the
thought
of
the
vast
variety
of
that
work
and
how
it
ranges
from
towering
visions
to
tiny
pricks
of
humour
overwhelmed
me
suddenly
in
retrospect
and
i
felt
we
had
none
of
us
ever
said
enough
also
your
words
apart
from
their
generosity
please
me
as
the
first
words
i
have
heard
for
a
long
time
of
the
old
agnosticism
of
my
boyhood
when
my
brother
cecil
and
my
friend
bentley
almost
worshipped
old
huxley
like
a
god
i
think
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
except
the
fact
that
the
other
side
often
forget
that
we
began
as
as
much
as
they
did
and
there
was
no
earthly
power
but
thinking
to
drive
us
on
the
way
we
went
thanking
you
again
a
thousand
times
for
your
letter
and
everything
else
yours
always
chesterton
my
dear
chesterton
you
write
wonderful
praise
and
it
leaves
me
all
aquiver
my
warmest
thanks
for
it
but
indeed
that
wonderful
fairness
of
mind
is
very
largely
a
kind
of
funk
in
me
i
know
the
creature
from
the
inside
funk
and
something
worse
a
kind
of
deep
complex
cunning
well
anyhow
you
take
the
superficial
merit
with
infinite
charity
and
it
has
inflated
me
and
just
for
a
time
i
am
an
air
balloon
over
the
heads
of
my
fellow
creatures
yours
ever
wells
gilbert
loved
to
praise
his
fellows
in
the
field
of
letters
even
when
their
philosophy
differed
from
his
own
in
the
obituaries
in
this
is
especially
noticeable
of
two
men
of
letters
who
died
in
he
wrote
with
respect
and
admiration
although
with
a
mind
divided
between
pure
literary
appreciation
and
those
principles
whereby
he
instinctively
measured
all
things
of
sir
edmund
gosse
he
wrote
the
men
from
whom
we
would
consent
to
learn
are
dying
felt
he
could
never
himself
appreciate
without
judging
but
he
could
learn
from
gosse
a
uniquely
sensitive
impartiality
with
him
there
passes
away
a
great
and
delicate
spirit
which
might
in
some
sense
be
called
the
spirit
of
the
eighteenth
century
which
might
indeed
be
very
rightly
called
the
spirit
of
reason
and
civilisation
may
these
are
the
things
we
hoped
would
stay
and
they
are
going
he
quoted
from
swinburne
and
of
him
and
of
hardy
who
died
in
and
in
whom
he
saluted
an
honourable
dignity
and
simplicity
he
felt
that
though
they
had
stated
something
false
about
the
universe
that
all
the
good
things
are
fugitive
and
only
the
bad
things
unchanged
yet
something
rather
like
it
might
be
a
half
truth
about
the
world
i
mean
about
the
modern
world
these
poets
lamented
the
passing
of
roses
and
sunbeams
but
in
the
modern
world
it
is
rather
as
if
in
some
inverted
witchcraft
the
rose
tree
withered
and
faded
from
sight
and
the
rose
leaves
remained
hovering
in
empty
air
it
is
as
if
there
could
be
sunbeams
when
there
was
no
more
sun
it
is
not
only
the
better
but
the
bigger
and
stronger
part
of
a
thing
that
is
sacrificed
to
the
small
and
secondary
part
the
real
evil
in
the
change
that
has
been
passing
over
society
is
the
fact
that
it
has
sapped
foundations
and
worse
still
has
not
shaken
the
palaces
and
spires
it
is
as
if
there
was
a
disease
in
the
world
that
only
devours
the
bones
we
have
not
weakened
the
gilded
parody
of
marriage
we
have
only
weakened
the
marriage
we
have
not
abolished
the
house
of
lords
because
it
was
not
democratic
we
have
merely
preserved
the
aristocracy
on
condition
that
it
shall
not
be
aristocratic
we
have
not
yet
even
disestablished
the
church
but
there
is
a
very
pressing
proposal
that
we
should
turn
out
of
it
the
only
people
who
really
believe
it
is
the
church
there
is
now
in
the
minds
of
nearly
all
capitalists
a
sort
of
corrupt
communism
the
bank
remains
the
fund
remains
the
foreign
financier
remains
parliamentary
procedure
remains
jix
remains
these
are
the
things
we
hoped
would
go
but
they
are
staying
sixteen
years
earlier
chesterton
had
in
victorian
age
in
characterised
hardy
novels
as
the
village
atheist
brooding
and
blaspheming
over
the
village
idiot
yet
cyril
clemens
has
told
me
that
hardy
recited
to
him
some
of
chesterton
poetry
and
i
think
this
obituary
links
with
that
fact
in
showing
that
a
profound
difference
in
their
philosophy
of
life
did
not
prevent
a
mutual
appreciation
and
even
admiration
gilbert
chesterton
entered
the
last
years
of
his
life
having
made
no
enemies
in
the
exceedingly
sensitive
literary
world
to
which
he
primarily
belonged
whether
he
had
made
any
in
the
world
of
politics
i
do
not
know
but
he
certainly
felt
no
enmities
he
said
once
it
was
impossible
to
hate
anything
except
an
idea
and
to
him
i
think
it
was
against
one
politician
who
died
in
he
had
many
years
ago
launched
his
strongest
bit
of
ironical
writing
lord
birkenhead
then
smith
who
had
spoken
of
the
welsh
disestablishment
bill
as
having
shocked
the
conscience
of
every
christian
community
in
europe
the
last
lines
of
chesterton
mordant
answer
ran
for
your
legal
cause
or
civil
you
fight
well
and
get
your
fee
for
your
god
or
dream
or
devil
you
will
answer
not
to
me
talk
about
the
pews
and
steeples
and
the
cash
that
goes
therewith
but
the
souls
of
christian
peoples
chuck
it
smith
later
smith
had
stood
with
sir
edward
carson
against
cecil
chesterton
at
the
old
bailey
now
he
was
dead
and
many
who
had
feared
him
in
his
lifetime
were
blackening
his
memory
with
subtle
sneers
and
innuendo
gilbert
refused
to
join
in
this
and
he
wrote
in
his
paper
in
him
we
were
confronted
by
and
fought
not
a
set
of
principles
but
a
man
lord
birkenhead
was
a
great
fighter
with
one
more
pagan
virtue
pride
he
would
have
been
a
great
pagan
lord
balfour
died
in
the
same
year
with
him
neither
the
paper
nor
its
editor
had
fought
personally
but
upon
almost
all
his
policies
had
stood
in
opposition
yet
few
better
appreciations
of
him
appeared
than
the
article
entitled
by
chesterton
a
man
of
distinction
the
english
squire
was
an
unconscious
aristocrat
the
scotch
laird
was
a
conscious
aristocrat
and
lord
balfour
with
all
his
social
grace
and
graciousness
was
conscious
and
even
but
this
was
only
another
way
of
saying
that
he
had
a
mind
which
mirrored
everything
including
himself
and
that
whatever
else
he
did
he
did
not
act
blindly
or
in
the
dark
he
was
sometimes
quite
wrong
but
his
errors
were
purely
patriotic
both
in
the
narrow
sense
of
nationalism
and
in
the
larger
sense
of
loyalty
and
disinterestedness
he
instances
balfour
policies
in
ireland
and
egypt
and
continues
in
some
ways
he
seems
to
me
to
have
been
too
good
a
stoic
to
be
entirely
a
good
christian
or
rather
to
put
it
more
correctly
to
feel
like
the
rest
of
us
that
he
was
a
bad
christian
there
was
much
more
in
him
of
the
scotch
puritan
than
of
the
english
cavalier
it
is
supremely
characteristic
of
the
present
parliamentary
atmosphere
that
everybody
accused
lord
balfour
of
incomprehensible
compromise
and
vagueness
because
he
was
completely
logical
and
absolutely
clear
clarity
does
look
like
a
cloud
of
confusion
to
people
whose
minds
live
in
confusion
twice
confounded
people
said
his
distinctions
were
fine
distinctions
and
so
they
were
very
fine
indeed
a
fine
distinction
is
like
a
fine
painting
or
a
fine
poem
or
anything
else
fine
a
triumph
of
the
human
mind
the
great
power
of
distinction
by
which
a
man
becomes
in
the
true
sense
distinguished
march
the
distinction
swinnerton
between
belloc
and
chesterton
may
be
a
little
too
absolute
but
substantially
it
is
right
one
reason
for
the
love
of
chesterton
was
that
while
he
fought
he
sang
lays
of
chivalry
and
in
spite
of
all
his
seriousness
warred
against
wickedness
rather
than
a
fleshly
opponent
while
belloc
sang
only
after
the
battle
and
warred
against
men
as
well
as
ideas
p
did
the
tendency
to
find
good
in
his
opponents
did
universal
charity
deaden
as
belloc
believes
the
effect
of
his
writing
he
wounded
none
but
thus
also
he
failed
to
provide
weapons
wherewith
one
may
wound
and
kill
folly
now
without
wounding
and
killing
there
is
no
battle
and
thus
in
this
life
no
victory
but
also
no
peril
to
the
soul
through
hatred
place
of
chesterton
in
english
p
in
various
controversies
during
the
final
years
of
the
very
opposite
opinion
is
expressed
hoffman
nickerson
writes
of
the
subversive
nature
of
chesterton
work
of
his
giving
weapons
to
communism
and
doing
his
bit
towards
starting
a
very
nasty
class
war
in
america
nickerson
was
allowed
to
develop
this
theme
in
a
series
of
articles
in
chesterton
own
paper
correspondents
too
complained
often
enough
in
the
paper
of
its
attacks
on
vested
interests
and
on
other
schools
of
thought
than
its
own
in
the
course
of
a
controversy
with
penty
in
which
i
think
most
distinctly
misunderstood
his
opponent
but
in
which
both
men
kept
the
friendliest
tone
penty
says
that
chesterton
treats
as
a
drive
much
that
he
himself
would
call
a
drift
that
the
mind
is
more
in
fault
than
the
will
of
mankind
in
getting
the
world
into
its
present
mess
with
this
diagnosis
chesterton
certainly
agreed
for
the
greater
part
of
mankind
he
spoke
often
of
a
madness
in
the
modern
mind
psychology
meant
the
mind
studying
itself
instead
of
studying
the
truth
and
it
was
part
of
what
had
destroyed
the
mind
advertisements
often
tell
us
to
watch
this
blank
space
i
confess
i
do
watch
that
blank
space
the
modern
mind
not
so
much
for
what
will
appear
in
it
as
for
what
has
already
disappeared
from
it
thus
too
when
the
rev
dick
shepherd
remarrying
a
divorced
woman
encouraging
her
to
take
again
the
solemn
vow
she
had
already
broken
said
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
christ
go
in
peace
it
was
not
for
impiety
that
chesterton
condemned
him
he
wrote
with
restraint
there
is
scarcely
a
shade
of
difference
left
between
meaning
well
and
meaning
nothing
was
penty
still
right
in
thinking
he
saw
a
drive
where
he
ought
to
see
a
drift
and
nickerson
in
thinking
he
was
dangerously
subversive
in
his
attitude
to
the
rich
and
anyhow
what
about
belloc
i
incline
to
think
that
the
truth
was
that
while
could
never
hate
an
individual
he
could
hate
a
group
if
he
suddenly
remembered
an
individual
in
that
group
he
hastily
excepted
him
from
the
group
in
order
to
leave
the
objects
of
his
hatred
entirely
impersonal
thus
he
hated
politicians
but
found
real
difficulty
in
hating
a
politician
he
hated
what
he
called
the
plutocracy
but
no
individual
rich
man
i
do
think
however
that
while
believing
firmly
in
original
sin
he
was
somewhat
inclined
to
see
it
as
operative
more
especially
in
the
classes
his
championship
of
the
poor
was
in
no
way
impersonal
his
burning
love
and
pity
went
out
to
every
beggar
he
tended
to
love
all
men
but
the
poor
he
loved
with
an
undivided
heart
and
when
he
thought
of
them
his
thoughts
grew
harsh
towards
the
rich
who
were
collectively
their
oppressors
i
doubt
if
he
allowed
enough
for
the
degree
of
stupidity
required
to
amass
a
fortune
he
would
have
agreed
that
love
of
money
narrowed
the
mind
i
doubt
if
he
fully
grasped
that
only
a
mind
already
narrow
can
love
money
so
exclusively
as
to
pursue
it
successfully
and
i
am
pretty
sure
he
did
not
allow
enough
for
the
fact
that
rich
like
poor
are
caught
today
in
the
machinery
they
have
created
he
saw
the
bewildered
confused
labourer
who
has
lost
his
liberty
he
failed
to
see
the
politician
also
bewildered
the
millionaire
also
confused
afraid
to
let
go
for
fear
he
might
be
submerged
and
yet
at
moments
he
did
see
it
he
wrote
in
the
paper
a
short
series
of
articles
on
men
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
had
created
the
confusion
of
today
on
malthus
adam
smith
and
darwin
far
from
its
being
true
that
supernatural
religion
had
first
been
destroyed
and
morality
lost
in
consequence
it
had
been
the
christian
morality
that
was
first
destroyed
in
the
mind
summarised
adam
smith
teachings
as
god
so
made
the
world
that
he
could
achieve
the
good
if
men
were
sufficiently
greedy
for
the
goods
thus
the
man
of
today
whenever
he
is
tempted
to
be
selfish
half
remembers
smith
and
whenever
he
would
harden
his
heart
against
a
beggar
he
half
remembers
malthus
and
a
book
about
population
whenever
he
has
scruples
about
crushing
a
rival
he
half
remembers
darwin
and
his
scruples
become
unscientific
because
none
of
these
theories
were
in
their
own
day
seen
as
heresies
and
denounced
as
heresies
they
have
lived
on
vaguely
to
poison
the
atmosphere
and
the
mind
of
today
english
conservatives
had
been
shocked
when
chesterton
began
nickerson
was
shocked
when
he
was
ending
because
he
demanded
a
revolution
surely
nickerson
said
if
he
looked
at
communism
closely
he
would
prefer
capitalism
he
not
only
would
he
constantly
said
he
did
but
he
wanted
a
revolution
from
both
he
preferred
that
it
should
not
be
nasty
for
what
he
wanted
was
the
christian
revolution
like
all
revolutions
however
it
must
begin
in
the
mind
and
he
felt
less
and
less
hopeful
as
he
watched
that
blank
space
but
i
do
not
believe
that
chesterton
failed
because
he
had
not
at
his
command
the
weapon
of
hatred
here
belloc
surely
makes
the
same
mistake
that
swift
whom
he
instances
made
and
for
the
same
reason
the
frenchman
and
the
irishman
understand
the
rapier
of
biting
satire
as
does
not
the
englishman
for
direct
abuse
of
anyone
no
matter
how
richly
merited
nearly
always
puts
the
englishman
on
the
side
of
the
man
who
is
being
abused
what
happened
to
swift
gulliver
that
most
fierce
attack
upon
the
human
race
the
english
people
drew
its
sting
and
turned
it
into
a
nursery
book
that
has
delighted
their
children
ever
since
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
winning
a
battle
you
can
win
the
man
instead
of
the
argument
and
chesterton
won
many
men
or
you
can
take
a
weapon
that
once
belonged
chiefly
to
the
enemy
but
which
chesterton
wrested
from
him
a
very
useful
weapon
the
laugh
orthodoxy
doctrinal
and
moral
was
a
lawful
object
of
amusement
to
voltaire
and
his
followers
but
now
the
laugh
has
passed
to
the
other
side
and
chesterton
was
with
belloc
himself
the
first
to
seize
this
powerful
weapon
thus
when
bishop
barnes
of
birmingham
said
that
francis
was
dirty
and
probably
had
fleas
many
catholics
were
furious
and
spoke
in
solemn
wrath
chesterton
wrote
the
simple
verse
bishop
rebukes
the
verminous
saint
if
brother
francis
pardoned
brother
flea
there
still
seems
need
of
such
strange
charity
seeing
he
is
for
all
his
gay
goodwill
bitten
by
funny
little
creatures
still
i
shall
never
forget
going
to
hear
chesterton
debate
on
birth
control
with
some
advanced
woman
or
other
outside
the
hall
were
numbers
of
her
satellites
offering
their
literature
i
was
just
about
to
say
something
unpleasant
to
one
of
them
when
a
verse
flashed
into
my
mind
if
i
had
been
a
heathen
i
have
crowned
neaera
curls
and
filled
my
life
with
love
affairs
my
house
with
dancing
girls
but
higgins
is
a
heathen
and
to
is
forced
where
his
aunts
who
are
not
married
demand
to
be
divorced
the
rebuke
died
on
my
lips
why
get
angry
with
the
poor
old
aunts
of
higgins
demanding
the
destruction
of
their
unconceived
and
inconceivable
babies
swinburne
had
mocked
at
christian
virtue
but
the
dolores
of
chesterton
replied
to
him
i
am
sorry
old
dear
if
i
hurt
you
no
doubt
it
is
all
very
nice
with
the
lilies
and
languors
of
virtue
and
the
raptures
and
roses
of
vice
but
the
notion
impels
me
to
anger
that
vice
is
all
rapture
for
me
and
if
you
think
virtue
is
languor
just
try
it
and
see
but
in
fact
did
not
merely
use
laughter
as
a
weapon
he
was
often
simply
amused
and
did
not
conceal
it
he
told
desmond
gleeson
that
he
remembered
reading
renan
christ
while
i
was
standing
in
the
queue
waiting
to
see
aunt
but
it
is
obvious
which
is
the
better
farce
for
aunt
is
still
running
no
wonder
that
eileen
duggan
when
she
pictured
him
as
a
modern
george
saw
him
shouting
gleefully
on
your
dragons
even
dragons
may
be
bothered
by
the
unexpected
and
it
may
well
be
that
when
the
rapier
of
anger
has
been
blunted
against
the
armour
of
some
accustomed
fighter
he
will
be
driven
off
the
field
by
gales
of
chestertonian
laughter
chapter

our
lady
tumbler
hate
to
be
influenced
i
like
to
be
commanded
or
to
be
free
in
both
of
these
my
own
soul
can
take
a
clear
and
conscious
part
for
when
i
am
free
it
must
be
for
something
that
i
really
like
and
not
something
that
i
am
persuaded
to
pretend
to
like
and
when
i
am
commanded
it
must
be
by
something
i
know
like
the
ten
commandments
but
the
thing
called
pressure
of
which
the
polite
name
is
persuasion
i
always
feel
to
be
a
hidden
enemy
it
is
all
a
part
of
that
worship
of
formlessness
and
flowing
tendencies
which
is
really
the
drift
of
cosmos
back
into
chaos
i
remember
how
i
suddenly
recoiled
in
youth
from
the
influence
of
matthew
arnold
who
said
many
things
very
well
worth
saying
when
he
told
me
that
god
was
a
stream
of
tendency
since
then
i
have
hated
tendencies
and
liked
to
know
where
i
was
going
and
go
there
or
in
when
gilbert
had
been
in
the
church
just
ten
years
and
frances
six
my
husband
and
i
met
them
at
the
eucharistic
congress
in
dublin
they
were
staying
at
the
lodge
and
were
very
happy
in
that
gathering
of
the
catholic
world
brought
about
by
the
congress
it
was
this
thought
of
the
potential
of
the
faith
for
a
unity
the
league
of
nations
could
not
achieve
only
dogma
is
strong
enough
to
unite
mankind
that
gave
its
title
to
the
book
in
in
the
crowd
that
thronged
to
that
great
gathering
he
saw
democracy
its
orderliness
was
more
than
a
mere
organisation
it
was
of
the
people
a
whole
mob
what
many
would
call
a
whole
rabble
was
doing
exactly
what
it
wanted
and
what
it
wanted
was
to
be
christian
the
mind
of
that
crowd
was
stretched
over
the
centuries
as
the
faint
sound
of
patrick
bell
that
had
been
silent
so
many
centuries
was
heard
in
phoenix
park
at
the
consecration
of
the
mass
it
was
stretched
over
the
earth
as
the
people
of
the
earth
gathered
into
one
place
which
had
become
for
the
time
rome
or
the
christian
centre
during
the
congress
an
eastern
priest
accosted
with
praise
of
his
writings
his
own
mind
full
of
the
great
ideas
of
christendom
and
the
faith
he
felt
a
huge
disproportion
in
the
allusion
to
himself
and
when
later
the
priest
asked
to
be
photographed
at
his
side
it
flashed
through
mind
that
he
had
heard
in
the
east
that
an
idiot
was
supposed
to
bring
luck
this
sort
of
humorous
yet
sincere
intellectual
humility
startles
us
in
the
same
kind
of
way
as
does
the
spiritual
humility
of
the
saints
we
have
to
accept
it
in
the
same
kind
of
way
without
in
the
least
understanding
it
but
simply
because
we
can
not
fail
to
see
it
but
the
world
could
fail
even
to
see
it
it
could
and
did
fail
in
imagining
a
mind
so
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
infinite
greatness
that
its
own
littleness
became
an
axiom
rather
it
seemed
an
affectation
none
the
less
an
affectation
and
much
the
less
pardonable
because
the
laughter
was
directed
against
others
as
well
as
against
himself
there
is
an
old
mediaeval
story
of
a
tumbler
who
converted
and
become
a
monk
found
himself
inapt
at
the
offices
of
choir
and
scriptorium
so
he
went
before
a
statue
of
our
lady
and
there
played
all
his
tricks
quite
exhausted
at
last
he
looked
up
at
the
statue
and
said
lady
this
is
a
choice
performance
there
is
more
than
a
touch
of
our
lady
tumbler
in
gilbert
he
knew
he
could
give
in
his
own
fashion
a
choice
performance
but
meeting
a
priest
come
from
a
far
land
where
he
had
reconciled
a
hitherto
schismatic
group
with
the
great
body
of
the
catholic
church
who
could
forgive
sins
and
offer
the
holy
sacrifice
he
truly
felt
something
disproportionate
in
finding
one
own
trivial
trade
or
tricks
of
the
trade
amid
the
revelations
of
such
a
of
all
the
tribes
of
men
in
p
his
awe
and
reverence
for
priests
was
says
father
rice
enormous
he
would
carefully
weigh
their
opinion
however
fatuous
his
comment
on
the
bad
statues
and
fripperies
which
so
many
catholics
find
a
trial
was
it
shows
the
wisdom
of
the
church
the
whole
thing
is
so
terrific
that
if
people
did
not
have
these
they
would
go
mad
yet
it
may
have
been
a
fear
of
excess
of
this
special
that
made
him
reluctant
to
go
to
lourdes
lisieux
he
never
liked
but
he
was
dorothy
says
fascinated
by
lourdes
when
she
persuaded
him
to
go
he
went
several
times
to
the
procession
and
he
said
as
he
had
said
in
dublin
this
is
the
only
real
league
of
nations
the
thing
he
liked
best
in
dublin
was
the
spontaneous
outburst
of
little
altars
and
amateur
decorations
in
the
poorest
quarters
of
the
city
the
story
he
loved
to
tell
was
that
of
the
old
woman
who
said
when
on
the
last
day
the
clouds
looked
threatening
well
if
it
rains
now
he
will
have
brought
it
on
himself
the
year
of
the
congress
two
other
books
were
published
on
new
london
and
newer
already
discussed
and
the
books
contrast
agreeably
one
throwing
the
ideal
against
the
real
of
his
own
day
the
other
evoking
his
ideal
from
the
past
the
was
much
criticised
chiefly
because
he
was
not
a
chaucer
scholar
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
notion
of
his
writing
this
book
did
not
originate
with
chesterton
but
with
richard
de
la
mare
who
had
projected
a
series
of
essays
called
the
poets
on
the
poets
this
developed
still
at
his
suggestion
into
a
literary
biography
of
chaucer
but
in
any
event
had
all
his
life
combatted
the
notion
that
only
a
scholar
should
write
on
such
themes
he
stood
resolutely
for
the
rights
of
the
amateur
yet
i
think
the
scholar
might
well
start
off
with
some
exasperation
on
reading
that
if
chaucer
had
been
called
the
father
of
english
poetry
so
had
an
obscure
like
caedmon
whose
writing
was
not
in
that
sense
poetry
and
not
in
any
sense
english
it
is
a
curious
example
of
one
of
the
faults
chesterton
himself
most
hated
overlooking
something
because
it
was
too
big
something
too
that
he
had
realised
in
an
earlier
work
for
caedmon
spoke
the
language
of
alfred
the
great
in
a
brilliant
garnering
of
the
fruits
of
her
scholarship
margaret
williams
has
quoted
chesterton
alfred
as
a
stirring
expression
of
the
significance
of
the
spiritual
conquest
of
england
by
christianity
in
the
same
book
she
shows
how
superficial
is
the
view
which
believes
that
the
english
language
was
a
creation
of
the
norman
conquest
the
struggle
she
says
between
the
english
and
french
tongues
lasted
for
some
three
hundred
years
until
the
two
finally
blended
into
a
unified
language
basically
teutonic
richly
romantic
the
english
spirit
emerged
predominant
by
a
moral
victory
over
its
conqueror
by
margaret
williams
p
no
one
would
wish
that
chesterton
should
have
ignored
the
immense
debt
owed
by
our
language
to
the
french
tributary
that
so
enriched
its
main
stream
but
it
seems
strange
that
in
his
hospitable
mind
in
which
alfred
england
held
so
large
a
place
he
should
not
have
found
room
for
an
appreciation
of
the
saxon
structure
of
chaucer
and
for
all
that
makes
him
unmistakably
one
in
a
line
of
which
caedmon
was
the
first
great
poet
in
this
book
only
his
debt
to
france
is
stressed
because
england
is
to
be
thought
of
as
part
of
europe
and
the
part
she
is
a
part
of
is
apparently
france
yet
what
excellent
things
there
are
in
the
book
the
great
poet
exists
to
show
the
small
man
how
great
he
is
the
great
poet
is
alone
strong
enough
to
measure
that
broken
strength
we
call
the
weakness
of
man
the
real
vice
of
the
victorians
was
that
they
regarded
history
as
a
story
that
ended
well
because
it
ended
with
the
victorians
they
turned
all
human
records
into
one
novel
and
were
quite
sure
that
they
themselves
were
the
third
volume
he
quotes
troilus
and
cressida
on
the
christian
majesty
of
the
mystery
of
marriage
any
man
who
really
understands
it
does
not
see
a
greek
king
sitting
on
an
ivory
throne
nor
a
feudal
lord
sitting
on
a
faldstool
but
god
in
a
primordial
garden
granting
the
most
gigantic
of
the
joys
of
the
children
of
men
when
we
talk
of
wild
poetry
we
sometimes
forget
the
parallel
of
wild
flowers
they
exist
to
show
that
a
thing
may
be
more
modest
and
delicate
for
being
wild
romance
was
a
strange
of
religion
all
the
more
because
religion
through
some
of
its
representatives
may
have
regretted
having
produced
it
even
the
church
as
imperfectly
represented
on
its
human
side
contrived
to
inspire
even
what
it
had
denounced
and
transformed
even
what
it
had
abandoned
the
best
chapter
is
the
last
the
moral
of
the
story
and
that
moral
is
that
no
man
should
desert
that
catholic
civilisation
it
can
cure
itself
but
those
who
leave
it
can
not
cure
it
not
nestorius
nor
mahomet
nor
calvin
nor
lenin
have
cured
nor
will
cure
the
real
evils
of
christendom
for
the
severed
hand
does
not
heal
the
whole
body
healing
must
come
from
a
recovery
of
the
norm
of
the
balance
of
the
equilibrium
that
mediaeval
philosophy
and
culture
were
always
seeking
the
meaning
of
aquinas
is
that
mediaevalism
was
always
seeking
a
centre
of
gravity
the
meaning
of
chaucer
is
that
when
found
it
was
always
a
centre
of
gaiety
the
name
of
aquinas
thus
introduced
on
almost
the
last
page
of
this
book
shows
chesterton
mind
already
busy
on
the
next
and
perhaps
most
important
book
of
his
life
thomas
great
news
this
wrote
shaw
to
frances
about
the
divine
doctor
i
have
been
preaching
for
years
that
intellect
is
a
passion
that
will
finally
become
the
most
ecstatic
of
all
the
passions
and
i
have
cherished
thomas
as
a
most
praiseworthy
creature
for
being
my
forerunner
on
this
point
when
we
were
told
that
gilbert
was
writing
a
book
on
thomas
and
that
we
might
have
the
american
rights
my
husband
felt
a
faint
quiver
of
apprehension
was
chesterton
for
once
undertaking
a
task
beyond
his
knowledge
such
masses
of
research
had
recently
been
done
on
thomas
by
experts
of
such
high
standing
and
he
could
not
possibly
have
read
it
all
nor
should
we
have
been
entirely
reassured
had
we
heard
what
dorothy
collins
told
us
later
concerning
the
writing
of
it
he
began
by
rapidly
dictating
to
dorothy
about
half
the
book
so
far
he
had
consulted
no
authorities
but
at
this
stage
he
said
to
her
i
want
you
to
go
to
london
and
get
me
some
books
what
books
asked
dorothy
i
do
know
said
she
wrote
therefore
to
father
and
from
him
got
a
list
of
classic
and
more
recent
books
on
thomas
flipped
them
rapidly
through
which
is
says
dorothy
the
only
way
she
ever
saw
him
read
and
then
dictated
to
her
the
rest
of
his
own
book
without
referring
to
them
again
there
are
no
marks
on
any
of
them
except
a
little
sketch
of
thomas
which
was
drawn
in
the
margin
opposite
a
description
of
the
affair
which
so
vividly
dramatises
of
siger
of
brabant
had
we
known
all
this
we
should
have
been
asking
ourselves
even
more
definitely
what
will
the
experts
say
of
the
verdict
of
the
greatest
of
them
we
were
not
long
left
in
doubt
etienne
gilson
who
has
given
two
of
the
most
famous
of
philosophical
lecture
series
the
gifford
lectures
at
aberdeen
and
the
william
james
lectures
at
harvard
had
begun
his
admiration
for
chesterton
with
at
and
had
thought
the
best
piece
of
apologetic
the
century
had
produced
when
appeared
he
said
to
a
friend
of
mine
chesterton
makes
one
despair
i
have
been
studying
thomas
all
my
life
and
i
could
never
have
written
such
a
book
after
death
asked
to
give
an
appreciation
he
returned
to
the
same
topic
i
consider
it
as
being
without
possible
comparison
the
best
book
ever
written
on
thomas
nothing
short
of
genius
can
account
for
such
an
achievement
everybody
will
no
doubt
admit
that
it
is
a
clever
book
but
the
few
readers
who
have
spent
twenty
or
thirty
years
in
studying
thomas
aquinas
and
who
perhaps
have
themselves
published
two
or
three
volumes
on
the
subject
can
not
fail
to
perceive
that
the
wit
of
chesterton
has
put
their
scholarship
to
shame
he
has
guessed
all
that
which
they
had
tried
to
demonstrate
and
he
has
said
all
that
which
they
were
more
or
less
clumsily
attempting
to
express
in
academic
formulas
chesterton
was
one
of
the
deepest
thinkers
who
ever
existed
he
was
deep
because
he
was
right
and
he
could
not
help
being
right
but
he
could
not
either
help
being
modest
and
charitable
so
he
left
it
to
those
who
could
understand
him
to
know
that
he
was
right
and
deep
to
the
others
he
apologized
for
being
right
and
he
made
up
for
being
deep
by
being
witty
that
is
all
they
can
see
of
him
by
cyril
clemens
pp
in
joining
the
church
chesterton
had
found
like
all
converts
from
paul
to
cardinal
newman
that
he
had
come
into
the
land
of
liberty
and
especially
of
intellectual
liberty
conversion
he
said
calls
on
a
man
to
stretch
his
mind
as
a
man
awakening
from
sleep
may
stretch
his
arms
and
legs
and
p
i
suppose
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
surrounding
world
finds
it
hard
to
receive
this
statement
from
a
convert
is
that
he
has
only
to
look
around
him
to
see
so
many
catholics
wrapped
in
slumbers
as
placid
as
the
next
man
to
this
very
real
difficulty
and
to
all
its
implications
chesterton
unfortunately
seldom
adverted
to
the
scandal
wrought
by
evil
catholics
historical
or
contemporary
he
was
not
blind
he
summarised
one
element
in
the

good
men
who
had
good
reason
to
be

but
i
wish
that
with
his
rare
insight
into
minds
he
had
analysed
us
average
catholics
he
might
have
startled
us
awake
by
explaining
to
those
who
know
such
truths
and
feed
upon
such
food
can
yet
appear
so
dull
and
lifeless
anyhow
whether
the
fault
lie
in
part
with
us
or
entirely
with
the
world
at
large
certain
it
is
that
in
that
world
a
convert
is
always
expected
to
justify
not
merely
his
beliefs
but
his
sincerity
in
continuing
to
hold
them
i
wonder
if
the
pharisees
said
of
paul
that
they
were
sure
he
really
wanted
to
return
to
his
old
allegiance
as
some
said
it
of
newman
or
spoke
as
arnold
bennett
did
when
he
accused
chesterton
of
being
modernist
in
his
secret
thoughts
were
paul
epistles
an
apologia
pro
vita
sua
an
apologia
does
not
of
course
mean
an
apology
but
a
justification
and
the
ground
on
which
justification
was
sometimes
demanded
amused
gilbert
rather
than
annoying
him
playing
the
parlour
game
which
consists
of
guessing
at
what
point
in
an
article
on
hydraulics
elegiacs
or
dean
inge
will
burst
into
his
daily
attack
on
the
church
he
wrote
the
dean
of
paul
got
to
business
in
a
paragraph
in
the
second
half
of
his
article
in
which
he
unveiled
to
his
readers
all
the
horrors
of
a
quotation
from
newman
a
very
shocking
and
shameful
passage
in
which
the
degraded
apostate
says
that
he
is
happy
in
his
religion
and
in
being
surrounded
by
the
things
of
his
religion
that
he
likes
to
have
objects
that
have
been
blessed
by
the
holy
and
beloved
that
there
is
a
sense
of
being
protected
by
prayers
sacramentals
and
so
on
and
that
happiness
of
this
sort
satisfies
the
soul
the
dean
having
given
us
this
one
ghastly
glimpse
of
the
cardinal
spiritual
condition
drops
the
curtain
with
a
groan
and
says
it
is
paganism
how
different
from
the
christian
orthodoxy
of
plotinus
pp
this
playful
not
to
say
frivolous
tone
was
fresh
cause
of
annoyance
to
those
who
were
apt
to
be
annoyed
it
is
easier
to
understand
their
objection
than
the
opposite
one
that
he
became
dull
and
prosy
after
he
joined
the
church
or
alternatively
after
he
left
fleet
street
for
beaconsfield
the
only
real
difficulty
about
his
later
work
arises
from
the
riot
of
his
high
spirits
in
his
own
style
i
must
say
there
are
moments
when
even
i
want
to
read
the
riot
act
and
those
who
admire
him
less
feel
this
more
keenly
bad
puns
they
say
wild
and
sometimes
jokes
are
perhaps
pardonable
in
youth
but
in
middle
age
they
are
inexcusable
the
complainants
against
are
in
substance
the
complainants
against
grown
more
vehement
with
the
passage
of
years
the
idea
had
been
adumbrated
of
calling
one
of
his
books
and
only
rejected
because
of
the
fear
that
if
he
said
he
was
joking
everyone
would
be
quite
certain
that
he
was
this
greatly
amused
and
he
began
the
book
it
actually
appeared
as
well
and
the
with
an
apology
for
buffoons
after
defending
the
human
instinct
of
punning
he
remarked
that
many
moderns
suffer
from
the
disease
of
the
suppressed
pun
they
are
actuated
even
in
their
thinking
by
merely
verbal
association
i
for
one
greatly
prefer
the
sort
of
frivolity
that
is
thrown
to
the
surface
like
froth
to
the
sort
of
frivolity
that
festers
under
the
surface
like
slime
to
pelt
an
enemy
with
a
foolish
pun
or
two
will
never
do
him
any
grave
injustice
the
firework
is
obviously
a
firework
and
not
a
deadly
fire
it
may
be
playing
to
the
gallery
but
even
the
gallery
knows
it
is
only
playing
and
pp
such
playing
was
a
necessity
if
the
gallery
all
the
people
were
to
be
made
to
listen
if
the
things
you
were
thinking
about
were
important
to
them
as
well
as
to
yourself
if
the
ideas
were
more
important
than
the
dignity
or
reputation
of
the
person
who
uttered
them
in
this
book
gilbert
sketched
briefly
one
side
of
his
reason
for
feeling
these
ideas
of
paramount
importance
for
everybody
my
six
conversions
concerned
reasons
given
him
by
the
world
that
would
have
made
him
become
a
catholic
if
he
were
not
one
already
he
had
been
brought
up
to
treasure
liberty
and
in
his
boyhood
the
world
had
seemed
freer
than
the
church
today
in
a
world
of
fascism
communism
and
bureaucracy
the
church
alone
offered
a
reasoned
liberty
he
had
been
brought
up
to
reverence
certain
ideals
of
purity
today
they
were
laughed
at
everywhere
but
in
the
church
the
sure
conclusions
of
science
that
had
stood
foursquare
in
his
boyhood
had
become
like
a
dissolving
view
liberalism
had
abdicated
when
the
people
of
spain
freely
chose
the
church
and
english
liberals
defended
the
forcing
upon
them
of
a
minority
rule
there
are
no
fascists
there
are
no
socialists
there
are
no
liberals
there
are
no
parliamentarians
there
is
the
one
supremely
inspiring
and
irritating
institution
in
the
world
and
there
are
its
enemies
above
all
he
felt
increasingly
as
time
went
on
that
those
who
left
the
faith
did
not
get
freedom
but
merely
fashion
that
there
was
something
ironic
in
the
name
the
atheists
chose
when
they
called
themselves
secularists
by
definition
they
had
tied
themselves
to
the
fashion
of
this
world
that
passeth
away
these
six
conversions
then
were
what
the
world
would
have
forced
upon
him
the
church
as
an
alternative
to
a
continually
worsening
civilisation
while
he
hated
the
utopias
of
the
futurists
and
while
he
accepted
the
christian
view
of
life
as
a
probation
he
felt
too
that
life
today
was
abnormally
degraded
and
unhappy
there
is
a
sense
in
which
men
may
be
made
normally
happy
but
there
is
another
sense
in
which
we
may
truly
say
without
undue
paradox
that
what
they
want
is
to
get
back
to
their
normal
unhappiness
at
present
they
are
suffering
from
an
utterly
abnormal
unhappiness
they
have
got
all
the
tragic
elements
essential
to
the
human
lot
to
contend
with
time
and
death
and
bereavement
and
unrequited
affection
and
dissatisfaction
with
themselves
but
they
have
not
got
the
elements
of
consolation
and
encouragement
that
ought
normally
to
renew
their
hopes
or
restore
their
they
have
not
got
vision
or
conviction
or
the
mastery
of
their
work
or
the
loyalty
of
their
household
or
any
form
of
human
dignity
even
the
latest
utopians
the
last
lingering
representatives
of
that
fated
and
unfortunate
race
do
not
really
promise
the
modern
man
that
he
shall
do
anything
or
own
anything
or
in
any
effectual
fashion
be
anything
they
only
promise
that
if
he
keeps
his
eyes
open
he
will
see
something
he
will
see
the
universal
trust
or
the
world
state
or
lord
melchett
coming
in
the
clouds
in
glory
but
the
modern
man
can
not
even
keep
his
eyes
open
he
is
too
weary
with
toil
and
a
long
succession
of
unsuccessful
utopias
he
has
fallen
asleep
october
chesterton
demanded
urgently
that
the
worldlings
who
had
failed
to
make
the
world
workable
should
abdicate
the
organic
thing
called
religion
has
in
fact
the
organs
that
take
hold
on
life
it
can
feed
where
the
fastidious
doubter
finds
no
food
it
can
reproduce
where
the
solitary
sceptic
boasts
of
being
barren
in
short
in
religion
alone
was
darwin
justified
for
catholicism
was
the
spiritual
survival
of
the
fittest
and
p
if
these
six
conversions
are
read
without
the
balancing
of
something
deeper
they
have
the
superficial
look
that
belongs
of
necessity
to
apologetics
some
essays
in
well
and
the
most
of
thing
christendom
in
and
above
all
queen
of
seven
give
us
that
deeper
quieter
thinking
when
the
mind
is
meditating
upon
the
great
mysteries
of
the
faith
only
very
occasionally
is
it
possible
to
glimpse
beneath
reserve
but
such
glimpses
are
illuminating
father
walker
who
prepared
him
for
his
first
communion
writes
it
was
one
of
the
most
happy
duties
i
had
ever
to
perform
that
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
the
immensity
of
the
real
presence
on
the
morning
of
his
first
communion
can
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
he
was
covered
with
perspiration
when
he
actually
received
our
lord
when
i
was
congratulating
him
he
said
have
spent
the
happiest
hour
of
my
life
yet
he
went
but
seldom
to
holy
communion
and
an
unfinished
letter
to
father
walker
gives
the
reason
the
trouble
with
me
is
that
i
am
much
too
frightened
of
that
tremendous
reality
on
the
altar
i
have
not
grown
up
with
it
and
it
is
too
much
for
me
i
think
i
am
morbid
but
i
want
to
be
told
so
by
authority
and
in
in
he
says
the
word
eucharist
is
but
a
verbal
symbol
we
might
say
a
vague
verbal
mask
for
something
so
tremendous
that
the
assertion
and
the
denial
of
it
have
alike
seemed
a
blasphemy
a
blasphemy
that
has
shaken
the
world
with
the
earthquake
of
two
thousand
years
i
have
heard
it
said
that
in
these
later
years
gilbert
writing
became
obscure
and
i
think
it
is
partly
true
only
partly
for
the
old
clarity
is
still
there
except
when
he
is
dealing
with
matters
almost
too
deep
for
human
speech
he
wrote
in
thing
a
thinking
man
can
think
himself
deeper
and
deeper
into
catholicism
the
great
mysteries
like
the
blessed
trinity
or
the
blessed
sacrament
are
the
for
trains
of
thought
stimulating
subtle
and
even
individual
to
accept
the
logos
as
a
truth
is
to
be
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
absolute
not
only
with
john
the
evangelist
but
with
plato
and
all
the
great
mystics
of
the
world
to
exalt
the
mass
is
to
enter
into
a
magnificent
world
of
metaphysical
ideas
illuminating
all
the
relations
of
matter
and
mind
of
flesh
and
spirit
of
the
most
impersonal
abstractions
as
well
as
the
most
personal
affections
even
what
are
called
the
fine
doctrinal
distinctions
are
not
dull
they
are
like
the
finest
operations
of
surgery
separating
nerve
from
nerve
but
giving
life
it
is
easy
enough
to
flatten
out
everything
around
for
miles
with
dynamite
if
our
only
object
is
to
give
death
but
just
as
the
physiologist
is
dealing
with
living
tissues
so
the
theologian
is
dealing
with
living
ideas
and
if
he
draws
a
line
between
them
it
is
naturally
a
very
fine
line
if
there
appears
a
contradiction
in
the
picture
of
chesterton
the
philosopher
pondering
on
the
logos
and
chesterton
the
child
offering
trinkets
to
our
lady
we
may
remember
the
eternal
wisdom
playing
in
the
world
playing
before
god
always
whose
delight
is
to
be
with
the
children
of
men
chapter
xxxi
the
living
voice
chesterton
spoke
once
of
the
keen
joy
for
the
intellect
of
discovering
the
causes
of
things
but
he
was
not
greatly
interested
in
science
he
would
have
said
that
although
the
physical
sciences
did
represent
an
advance
in
the
grasp
of
truth
it
was
in
the
words
of
browning
only
the
very
superficial
truth
he
desired
a
knowledge
of
causes
that
did
not
dwell
simply
on
what
was
secondary
but
led
back
to
the
first
and
final
cause
to
the
mediaeval
thinker
science
was
fascinating
as
philosophy
little
sister
it
was
to
philosophy
what
nature
was
to
man
nature
had
been
to
francis
a
little
lovely
dancing
sister
science
had
been
to
thomas
the
handmaid
of
philosophy
the
modern
world
thought
these
proportions
fantastic
huxley
used
nature
as
a
word
for
god
physical
science
had
ousted
philosophy
an
american
friend
lately
told
me
of
a
girl
who
asked
if
she
believed
in
god
replied
sure
i
believe
in
god
but
i
not
nuts
about
him
gilbert
was
not
nuts
about
science
therefore
in
a
world
that
saw
nothing
else
to
be
nuts
about
he
was
called
its
enemy
and
as
with
other
things
taken
more
solemnly
by
most
moderns
he
preferred
to
get
fun
out
of
the
inventions
of
the
age
he
wrote
in
a
fairly
early
number
of
weekly
eskimo
song
so
that
the
audience
in
chicago
will
have
the
advantage
of
hearing
eskimos
singing
or
words
to
that
effect
oh
who
would
not
want
such
a
wonderful
thing
as
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
eskimos
sing
i
wish
i
had
eskimos
out
on
the
lawn
or
perched
on
the
window
to
wake
me
at
dawn
with
eskimos
singing
in
every
tree
oh
that
would
be
glory
be
glory
for
me
oh
list
to
the
song
that
the
eskimos
sing
when
the
penguin
would
be
if
he
could
on
the
wing
would
soar
to
the
sun
if
he
could
like
the
lark
but
for
most
of
the
time
it
is
totally
dark
or
hark
to
the
bacchanal
songs
that
resound
when
they
making
a
night
of
it
half
the
year
round
and
carousing
for
months
till
the
morning
is
pale
go
home
with
the
milk
of
the
walrus
and
whale
oh
list
to
the
sweet
serenades
that
are
hers
who
expensively
gowned
in
most
elegant
furs
leans
forth
from
the
lattice
delighted
to
know
that
her
heart
is
like
ice
and
her
hand
is
like
snow
god
bless
all
the
dear
little
people
who
roam
and
hail
in
the
icebergs
the
hills
of
their
home
for
i
might
not
object
to
be
listening
in
if
i
had
to
hear
the
whole
programme
begin
and
the
president
preach
international
peace
and
parricide
show
an
alarming
increase
and
a
justice
at
bootle
excuse
the
police
and
how
to
clean
trousers
when
spotted
with
grease
and
a
pianist
biting
his
wife
from
caprice
and
an
eminent
baptist
arrival
at
nice
and
a
banker
regrettably
painless
decease
and
the
new
quarantine
for
the
plucking
of
geese
and
a
mad
millionaire
unobtrusive
release
and
a
marquis
divorced
by
a
usurer
niece
if
all
of
these
items
could
suddenly
cease
and
leave
me
with
one
satisfactory
thing
i
really
like
to
hear
eskimos
sing
this
was
hardly
the
expression
of
an
attitude
to
science
but
he
did
have
such
an
attitude
life
was
to
him
a
story
told
by
god
the
people
in
it
the
characters
in
that
story
but
since
the
story
was
told
by
god
it
was
quite
literally
a
magic
story
a
fairy
story
a
story
full
of
wonders
created
by
a
divine
will
as
a
child
a
toy
telephone
rigged
up
by
his
father
from
the
house
to
the
end
of
the
garden
had
breathed
that
magic
quality
more
than
the
transatlantic
cable
could
reveal
it
in
later
life
it
did
not
need
mechanical
inventions
to
make
him
see
life
as
marvellous
his
interest
was
not
in
mechanics
but
in
will
the
will
of
god
had
created
the
laws
of
nature
and
could
supersede
them
the
will
of
man
could
discover
these
laws
and
harness
them
to
its
purposes
gold
is
where
you
find
it
and
the
value
of
science
depends
on
the
will
of
man
a
position
which
may
not
sound
so
absurd
in
the
light
of
the
harnessing
of
science
to
the
purposes
of
destruction
when
discussing
machines
we
sometimes
tend
said
chesterton
in
to
overlook
the
quiet
and
even
bashful
presence
of
the
machine
gun
there
was
an
impishness
in
gilbert
especially
in
his
youth
that
encouraged
the
idea
of
his
enmity
to
science
where
he
saw
a
long
white
beard
he
felt
like
tweaking
it
an
enquiring
nose
simply
asked
to
be
pulled
it
was
only
in
comparatively
sober
age
that
he
bothered
in
everlasting
to
explain
i
am
not
at
issue
in
this
book
with
sincere
and
genuine
scholars
but
with
a
vast
and
vague
public
opinion
which
has
been
prematurely
spread
from
certain
imperfect
investigations
that
vast
and
vague
public
opinion
certainly
suspected
him
of
irreverence
even
towards
sincere
and
genuine
scholars
yet
it
was
by
his
use
of
the
most
marvelous
of
modern
inventions
that
he
won
in
the
end
the
widest
hearing
among
that
public
that
he
had
ever
known
everlasting
p
it
is
not
so
many
years
ago
that
we
donned
earphones
in
a
doubtful
hope
of
being
able
to
hear
something
over
the
radio
it
is
the
less
surprising
that
it
was
only
in
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
that
gilbert
became
first
interested
in
the
invention
and
presently
one
of
the
broadcasters
most
in
request
by
the
he
felt
about
the
radio
as
he
did
about
most
modern
inventions
that
they
were
splendid
opportunities
that
were
not
being
taken
or
else
were
being
taken
to
the
harm
of
humanity
by
the
wrong
people
what
was
the
use
of
calling
all
countries
if
you
had
nothing
to
say
to
them
what
much
modern
science
fails
to
realise
he
wrote
is
that
there
is
little
use
in
knowing
without
thinking
and
again
writing
about
the
amazing
discoveries
of
the
day
nobody
is
taking
the
smallest
trouble
to
consider
who
in
the
future
will
be
in
command
of
the
electricity
and
capable
of
giving
us
the
shocks
with
all
the
shouting
about
the
new
marvels
hardly
anybody
utters
a
word
or
even
a
whisper
about
how
they
are
to
be
prevented
from
turning
into
the
old
abuses
people
sometimes
wonder
why
we
not
infrequently
refer
to
the
old
scandal
covered
by
the
word
marconi
it
is
precisely
because
all
these
things
are
really
covered
by
that
word
there
could
not
be
a
shorter
statement
of
the
contradiction
than
in
men
howling
that
word
as
a
discovery
and
hushing
it
up
as
a
story
for
the
thing
that
really
frightened
him
about
the
radio
was
its
possibilities
as
a
new
instrument
of
tyranny
the
british
broadcasting
company
holds
in
england
a
monopoly
and
is
to
a
considerable
extent
under
government
control
it
is
possible
to
forbid
advertising
programmes
because
the
costs
are
met
by
a
tax
of
sh
a
year
levied
on
the
possession
of
a
radio
set
in
an
article
called
the
unseen
catastrophe
january
gilbert
wrote
suppose
you
had
told
some
of
the
old
whigs
let
alone
liberals
that
there
was
an
entirely
new
type
of
printing
press
eclipsing
all
others
and
that
as
this
was
to
be
given
to
the
king
all
printing
would
henceforth
be
government
printing
they
would
be
roaring
like
rebels
or
even
regicides
yet
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
done
with
the
whole
new
invention
of
wireless
suppose
it
were
proposed
that
the
king
officers
should
search
all
private
houses
to
make
sure
there
were
no
printing
presses
they
would
be
ready
for
a
new
revolution
yet
that
is
exactly
what
is
proposed
for
the
protection
of
the
government
monopoly
of
broadcasting
there
is
really
no
protection
against
propaganda
being
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
government
except
indeed
the
incredible
of
those
who
govern
on
that
sort
of
thing
at
least
we
are
all
socialists
now
it
is
wicked
to
nationalize
mines
or
railroads
but
we
lose
no
time
in
nationalizing
tongues
and
talk
we
might
once
have
used
and
we
shall
now
never
use
the
twentieth
century
science
against
the
nineteenth
century
hypocrisy
it
was
prevented
by
a
swift
sweeping
and
intolerant
state
monopoly
a
monster
suddenly
swallowing
all
rivals
alternatives
discussions
or
delays
with
one
snap
of
its
gigantic
jaws
that
is
what
i
mean
by
saying
we
can
not
see
the
monsters
that
overcome
us
but
i
suppose
that
even
jonah
when
once
he
was
swallowed
could
not
see
the
whale
in
the
autumn
of
gilbert
was
first
asked
to
undertake
a
series
of
radio
talks
for
the
every
one
seems
agreed
that
he
was
an
extraordinary
success
letters
from
broadcasting
house
are
full
of
such
remarks
as
you
do
it
admirably
quite
superb
at
the
microphone
in
one
his
work
is
called
unique
radio
was
now
added
to
all
his
other
activities
during
the
four
years
he
still
had
to
live
dorothy
kept
a
diary
in
which
she
noted
in
one
year
the
giving
of
as
many
as
forty
lectures
and
entered
reminders
of
engagements
of
the
most
varying
kinds
all
over
england
from
the
king
garden
party
to
the
aylesbury
education
committee
and
the
oxford
union
to
scotland
for
rectorial
campaigns
dinners
at
the
inner
temple
and
the
philosophical
society
detection
club
dinners
and
mock
trials
at
one
of
which
he
was
defendant
on
the
charge
of
perversely
preferring
the
past
to
the
present
besides
the
books
discussed
in
the
last
chapter
the
and
the
were
republished
in
other
books
were
planned
including
one
on
shakespeare
that
same
year
gilbert
mother
died
during
her
last
illness
frances
was
torn
between
london
and
beaconsfield
for
her
own
mother
was
dying
in
a
nursing
home
at
beaconsfield
her
at
warwick
gardens
once
i
drove
with
her
between
the
two
and
she
told
me
how
she
suffered
at
the
difficulty
of
giving
help
to
two
dying
agnostics
she
told
me
on
that
drive
how
she
knew
her
had
not
liked
her
but
had
lately
made
her
very
happy
by
saying
she
realised
now
that
she
had
been
the
right
wife
for
gilbert
to
a
cousin
nora
grosjean
frances
spoke
too
of
how
she
and
edward
had
drawn
together
in
those
last
days
and
she
added
no
mother
ever
thinks
any
woman
good
enough
for
her
son
nora
grosjean
also
reports
aunt
marie
said
to
me
more
than
once
always
respect
frances
she
kept
gilbert
out
of
debt
warwick
gardens
had
been
their
home
so
long
that
vast
accumulations
of
papers
had
piled
up
there
mister
ed
too
had
been
in
a
sort
keeper
of
the
family
archives
gilbert
glanced
at
the
mass
and
as
i
mentioned
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
told
the
dustman
to
carry
it
off
half
had
already
gone
when
dorothy
collins
arrived
and
saved
the
remainder
she
piled
it
into
her
car
and
drove
back
to
beaconsfield
gilbert
keeping
up
a
running
commentary
all
the
way
on
the
hoarding
habits
of
women
the
money
that
came
to
gilbert
and
frances
after
edward
death
made
it
possible
for
them
to
plan
legacies
not
only
for
friends
and
relatives
but
also
for
the
catholic
church
in
beaconsfield
with
which
they
had
increasingly
identified
their
lives
and
their
interests
their
special
dream
was
that
top
meadow
itself
should
be
a
convent
best
of
all
a
school
and
in
this
hope
they
bequeathed
it
to
the
church
a
year
later
another
family
event
this
time
a
joyful
one
took
gilbert
back
to
his
youth
mollie
kidd
daughter
of
annie
firmin
became
engaged
to
be
married
she
was
a
rather
special
young
cousin
to
gilbert
both
because
of
the
old
affection
for
her
mother
and
because
she
had
played
hostess
to
him
in
canada
when
her
mother
was
ill
he
wrote
postmark
my
dear
mollie
i
am
afraid
that
chronologically
or
by
the
clock
i
am
relatively
late
in
sending
you
my
most
warm
congratulations
and
yet
i
do
assure
you
that
i
write
as
one
still
thrilled
and
almost
throbbing
with
good
news
it
would
take
pages
to
tell
you
all
i
feel
about
it
beginning
with
my
first
memory
of
your
mother
when
she
was
astonishingly
like
you
except
that
she
had
yellow
plaits
of
hair
down
her
back
i
do
not
absolutely
insist
that
you
should
now
imitate
her
in
this
but
you
would
not
be
far
wrong
if
you
imitate
her
in
anything
and
so
on
till
we
come
to
the
superb
rhetorical
passage
about
you
and
the
right
fulfilment
of
youth
it
would
take
pages
and
that
is
why
the
pages
are
never
written
we
bad
correspondents
we
vile
of
letters
have
a
sort
of
secret
excuse
that
no
one
will
ever
listen
to
till
the
day
of
judgment
when
all
infinite
patience
will
have
to
listen
to
so
much
it
is
often
because
we
think
so
much
about
our
friends
that
we
do
not
write
to
them
the
letters
would
be
too
long
especially
in
the
case
of
wretched
writing
men
like
me
who
feel
in
their
spare
time
that
writing
is
loathsome
and
thinking
about
their
friends
pleasant
in
the
course
of
turning
out
about
ten
articles
on
hitler
on
humanism
on
determinism
on
distributism
on
dollfuss
and
darwin
and
the
devil
knows
what
there
really
are
thoughts
about
real
people
that
cross
my
mind
suddenly
and
make
me
really
happy
in
a
real
way
and
one
of
them
is
the
news
of
your
engagement
please
believe
dear
mollie
that
i
am
writing
the
truth
though
i
am
a
journalist
and
give
my
congratulations
to
everyone
involved
yours
with
love
chesterton
and
in
that
year
came
two
bits
of
public
recognition
of
rather
different
kinds
he
was
elected
to
the
athenaeum
club
under
rule
ii
honoris
causa
and
he
and
belloc
were
given
by
the
pope
the
title
of
knight
commander
of
gregory
with
star
during
these
years
the
paper
had
gone
steadily
on
at
some
considerable
inconvenience
because
he
said
he
still
felt
it
had
a
part
to
play
at
home
and
abroad
the
scene
had
been
steadily
darkening
in
july
three
years
before
hitler
came
to
the
chancellorship
we
find
the
following
among
the
notes
of
the
week
when
we
are
told
that
the
ancient
marshal
hindenburg
is
now
dictator
of
germany
we
suspect
a
note
of
exaggeration
hindenburg
never
was
the
dictator
of
anything
and
never
will
be
he
is
however
the
man
who
keeps
the
seat
warm
for
a
dictator
to
come
hindenburg
has
led
us
back
to
frederick
the
great
hindenburg
has
now
given
rein
to
the
extreme
nationalists
with
the
delivered
provinces
to
support
him
in
the
flush
of
patriotism
and
the
extreme
nationalists
have
only
one
policy
to
reconstitute
the
unjust
frontiers
of
germany
which
europe
fought
to
amend
in
had
come
the
customs
union
between
germany
and
austria
the
obvious
impotence
of
the
league
of
nations
to
restrain
japan
the
national
government
and
falling
sterling
in
england
less
than
two
years
later
hitler
was
chancellor
of
germany
and
in
came
the
murder
of
dollfuss
chesterton
wrote
of
the
tragedy
whereby
the
name
germany
was
taken
from
austria
and
given
to
prussia
with
dollfuss
fell
all
that
was
left
of
the
holy
roman
empire
the
barbarians
had
invaded
the
center
of
our
civilisation
and
like
the
turks
besieging
vienna
had
struck
at
its
heart
he
regarded
hitler
merely
as
the
tool
of
prussianism
the
new
paganism
was
the
logical
outcome
of
the
old
prussianism
it
was
too
the
apotheosis
of
tyranny
in
the
pagan
state
in
antiquity
or
modernity
you
can
not
appeal
from
tyranny
to
god
because
the
tyranny
is
the
god
belloc
solemnly
warned
our
country
that
we
were
making
inevitable
the
death
in
great
pain
of
innumerable
young
englishmen
now
boys
it
may
be
in
two
years
or
in
five
or
in
ten
the
blow
will
fall
november
yet
even
this
seemed
less
terrible
to
chesterton
than
the
state
of
mind
then
prevailing
the
mood
nay
the
fever
of
pacifism
that
demanded
the
isolation
of
england
from
europe
peril
he
called
it
mafficking
for
peace
a
sort
of
imperialism
that
forgot
that
the
atlantic
is
wider
than
the
straits
of
dover
and
allowed
lord
beaverbrook
to
regard
england
as
a
part
of
canada
englishmen
who
have
felt
that
fever
will
one
day
look
back
on
it
with
shame
this
most
noble
and
generous
nation
he
wrote
with
a
note
of
agony
which
lost
its
religion
in
the
seventeenth
century
has
lost
its
morals
in
the
twentieth
the
league
of
nations
had
held
been
thought
at
first
to
be
a
kind
of
pentecost
but
had
in
reality
come
together
to
rebuild
the
tower
of
babel
and
this
because
it
had
no
common
basis
in
religion
humanitarianism
does
not
unite
humanity
for
even
one
isolated
man
is
half
divine
but
today
man
had
despaired
of
man
hope
for
the
superman
is
another
name
for
despair
of
man
reading
a
recent
commentary
in
a
review
i
suddenly
saw
that
politics
and
economics
were
not
what
mattered
most
in
the
paper
the
commentary
in
question
was
to
the
effect
that
was
inferior
to
the
because
had
only
general
principles
and
ideas
and
no
detailed
inside
knowledge
of
how
the
world
of
finance
and
politics
was
going
looking
again
through
the
articles
i
had
marked
as
most
characteristically
his
i
saw
that
they
were
not
only
chiefly
about
ideas
and
principles
but
also
that
they
were
mostly
pure
poetry
chesterton
was
i
believe
greatest
and
most
permanently
effective
when
he
was
moved
not
by
a
passing
irritation
with
the
things
that
pass
but
by
the
great
emotions
evoked
by
the
eternal
emotions
which
in
eternity
alone
will
find
full
fruition
there
are
in
the
paper
articles
in
which
appearing
to
speak
out
of
his
own
knowledge
he
is
merely
repeating
information
given
him
by
belloc
and
it
was
quite
out
of
chesterton
character
to
write
with
certainty
about
what
he
did
not
know
with
certainty
hence
this
writing
is
his
weakest
but
the
paper
has
too
some
of
his
strongest
work
and
his
mind
as
he
drew
to
the
end
of
life
lingered
on
thoughts
that
had
haunted
him
in
its
beginning
before
the
boer
war
had
introduced
me
to
politics
or
worse
still
to
politicians
he
wrote
in
a
christmas
article
in
i
had
some
vague
and
groping
ideas
of
my
own
about
a
general
view
or
vision
of
existence
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
had
anything
worth
calling
a
religion
what
i
had
was
not
even
sufficiently
coherent
to
be
called
a
philosophy
but
it
was
in
a
sense
a
view
of
life
i
had
it
in
the
beginning
and
i
am
more
and
more
coming
back
to
it
in
the
end
my
original
and
almost
mystical
conviction
of
the
miracle
of
all
existence
and
the
essential
excitement
of
all
experience
december
this
he
felt
must
be
the
profound
philosophy
by
which
distributism
should
succeed
and
whereby
he
tested
the
modern
world
and
found
it
wanting
something
of
which
christmas
is
the
best
traditional
symbol
it
was
then
no
more
than
a
notion
about
the
point
at
which
extremes
meet
and
the
most
common
thing
becomes
a
cosmic
and
mystical
thing
i
did
not
want
so
much
to
alter
the
place
and
use
of
things
as
to
weight
them
with
a
new
dimension
to
deepen
them
by
going
down
to
the
potential
nothing
to
lift
them
to
infinity
by
measuring
from
zero
the
most
logical
form
of
this
is
in
thanks
to
a
creator
but
at
every
stage
i
felt
that
such
praises
could
never
rise
too
high
because
they
could
not
even
reach
the
height
of
our
own
thanks
for
unthinkable
existence
or
horror
of
more
unthinkable
and
the
commonest
things
as
much
as
the
most
complex
could
thus
leap
up
like
fountains
of
praise
we
shall
need
a
sort
of
distributist
psychology
as
well
as
a
distributist
philosophy
that
is
partly
why
i
am
not
content
with
plausible
solutions
about
credit
or
corporative
rule
we
need
a
new
or
old
theory
and
practice
of
pleasure
the
vulgar
school
of
panem
et
circenses
only
gives
people
circuses
it
does
not
even
tell
them
how
to
enjoy
circuses
but
we
have
not
merely
to
tell
them
how
to
enjoy
circuses
we
have
to
tell
them
how
to
enjoy
enjoyment
december
in
attacking
a
special
abuse
chesterton
was
most
successful
when
he
took
the
thought
to
a
deeper
depth
the
following
christmas
he
wrote
we
live
in
a
terrible
time
of
war
and
rumour
of
war
international
idealism
in
its
effort
to
hold
the
world
together
is
admittedly
weakened
and
often
disappointed
i
should
say
simply
that
it
does
not
go
deep
enough
if
we
really
wish
to
make
vivid
the
horrors
of
destruction
and
mere
disciplined
murder
we
must
see
them
more
simply
as
attacks
on
the
hearth
and
the
human
family
and
feel
about
hitler
as
men
felt
about
herod
the
modern
world
tended
to
gild
pure
gold
and
then
try
to
scrape
the
gilt
off
the
gingerbread
to
paint
the
lily
and
then
complain
of
its
gaudiness
thus
it
had
vulgarised
christmas
and
now
demanded
the
abolition
of
christmas
because
it
was
vulgar
it
was
the
truth
he
had
emphasised
years
ago
in
contrast
with
shaw
the
world
had
spoilt
the
ideas
but
it
was
the
christian
ideas
the
world
needed
if
only
in
order
to
recover
the
human
ideas
he
went
on
if
we
want
to
talk
about
poverty
we
must
talk
about
it
as
the
hunger
of
a
human
being
we
must
say
first
of
the
beggar
not
that
there
is
insufficient
housing
accommodation
but
that
he
has
not
where
to
lay
his
head
we
must
talk
of
the
human
family
in
language
as
plain
and
practical
and
positive
as
that
in
which
mystics
used
to
talk
of
the
holy
family
we
must
learn
again
to
use
the
naked
words
that
describe
a
natural
thing
then
we
shall
draw
on
the
driving
force
of
many
thousand
years
and
call
up
a
real
humanitarianism
out
of
the
depths
of
humanity
i
should
like
to
collect
all
the
essays
and
poems
on
christmas
he
wrote
several
every
year
yet
each
is
different
each
goes
to
the
heart
of
his
thought
as
christopher
morley
says
one
of
the
simple
greatnesses
of
shows
in
this
that
we
think
of
him
instinctively
toward
christmas
time
some
men
it
may
be
are
best
moved
to
reform
by
hate
but
chesterton
was
best
moved
by
love
and
nowhere
does
that
love
shine
more
clearly
than
in
all
he
wrote
about
christmas
it
will
be
for
this
philosophy
this
charity
this
poetry
that
men
will
turn
over
the
pages
of
a
century
hence
if
the
world
still
lasts
it
is
for
us
who
are
his
followers
to
see
that
they
are
truly
creative
destruction
of
evil
is
a
great
work
but
if
it
leaves
only
a
vacuum
nature
abhors
that
vacuum
creation
is
what
matters
for
the
future
and
chesterton
writing
is
creative
twain
spring
so
too
with
the
radio
in
this
new
medium
his
mind
was
alert
to
present
his
ideas
his
fundamental
philosophy
of
life
after
some
fresh
fashion
a
letter
from
broadcasting
house
after
his
first
talk
records
the
delight
of
all
who
heard
it
the
building
rings
with
your
praises
i
knew
i
was
not
alone
in
my
delight
over
your
first
talk
i
think
even
you
in
your
modesty
will
find
some
pleasure
in
hearing
what
widespread
interest
there
is
in
what
you
are
doing
you
bring
us
something
very
rare
to
the
microphone
i
am
most
anxious
that
you
should
be
with
us
till
after
christmas
you
will
have
a
vast
public
by
christmas
and
it
is
good
that
they
should
hear
you
would
you
undertake
six
further
fortnightly
talks
from
january
onwards
he
was
asked
to
submit
a
manuscript
but
promised
he
should
not
be
kept
to
the
letter
of
it
we
should
like
you
to
make
variations
as
these
occur
to
you
as
you
speak
at
the
microphone
only
so
can
the
talk
have
a
real
show
of
spontaneity
about
it
you
will
forgive
me
one
official
writes
if
i
insist
on
speaking
to
you
personally
that
is
how
i
think
of
our
relations
was
unique
and
they
told
him
so
a
lot
of
reading
was
necessary
for
these
talks
each
one
dealing
with
from
four
to
ten
books
and
also
a
principle
of
selection
the
principle
gilbert
chose
for
one
series
was
historical
literature
lives
by
history
otherwise
it
exists
like
trigonometry
in
the
fifth
talk
of
the
autumn
series
of
he
gives
a
general
idea
of
what
he
has
been
attempting
this
is
the
hardest
job
i
have
had
in
all
these
wireless
talks
and
i
confront
you
in
a
spirit
of
hatred
because
of
the
toils
i
have
endured
on
your
behalf
but
after
all
what
are
my
sufferings
compared
to
yours
incredible
as
it
may
seem
to
anybody
who
has
heard
these
talks
they
had
originally
a
certain
consistent
plan
i
dealt
first
with
heroic
and
stories
touched
upon
medieval
chivalry
then
on
the
of
elizabethan
or
puritan
times
then
on
the
eighteenth
century
and
then
the
nineteenth
in
this
address
i
had
meant
to
face
the
twentieth
century
but
i
find
it
almost
faceless
largely
featureless
and
anyhow
very
bewildering
i
had
meant
to
take
books
typical
of
the
twentieth
century
as
a
book
on
steele
is
typical
of
the
eighteenth
or
a
book
on
rossetti
of
the
nineteenth
and
i
have
collected
a
number
of
most
interesting
twentieth
century
books
claiming
to
declare
a
philosophy
they
really
have
a
common
quality
but
i
rather
hesitate
to
define
it
suppose
i
said
that
the
main
mark
of
the
twentieth
century
in
ethics
as
in
economics
is
bankruptcy
i
fear
you
might
think
i
was
a
little
hostile
in
my
criticism
suppose
i
said
that
all
these
books
are
marked
by
a
brilliant
futility
you
might
almost
fancy
that
i
was
not
entirely
friendly
to
them
you
would
be
mistaken
all
of
them
are
good
some
of
them
are
very
good
indeed
but
the
question
does
recur
what
is
the
good
of
being
good
in
that
way
geoffrey
west
curious
post
war
credo
has
one
commandment
he
does
say
he
does
shout
we
might
say
he
does
yell
that
there
must
be
no
war
but
he
can
not
impose
his
view
because
authority
has
gone
and
he
can
not
prove
his
view
because
reason
has
gone
so
again
it
all
comes
back
to
taste
and
i
have
enjoyed
the
banquet
of
these
excellent
books
but
it
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
the
peculiar
direction
of
broadcasting
house
is
based
on
a
theory
of
strict
impartiality
towards
all
opinions
and
an
attempt
simply
to
give
the
public
the
programmes
that
the
public
wants
whether
it
is
possible
to
maintain
such
a
position
is
another
question
that
this
is
the
theory
there
is
no
doubt
and
one
result
is
an
abiding
uncertainty
of
mind
in
most
of
the
officials
broadcasting
house
hangs
suspended
in
the
air
of
public
opinion
and
that
fickle
breath
leaves
them
in
no
security
as
to
any
of
their
artists
the
resulting
sensitiveness
became
soothed
as
the
months
passed
on
and
they
got
as
near
to
trusting
chesterton
as
they
ever
come
with
any
one
true
letters
came
attacking
him
but
far
more
enthusiastically
approving
of
him
and
the
attacks
he
answered
often
by
private
letters
that
turned
the
critic
into
a
friend
some
of
his
suggestions
were
not
acceptable
he
was
warned
off
a
proposed
humorous
talk
about
dean
inge
and
bishop
barnes
in
a
series
called
speeches
that
never
happened
subject
too
serious
avoid
religion
but
he
was
later
asked
to
talk
in
a
series
on
freedom
as
a
catholic
and
also
to
debate
with
bertrand
russell
on
who
should
bring
up
our
children
in
this
debate
he
was
especially
brilliant
says
maurice
baring
and
another
friend
wrote
i
have
just
been
listening
not
without
joy
to
your
putting
it
across
bertrand
russell
what
a
mincer
it
struck
me
very
much
having
read
much
of
his
writing
with
interest
it
just
shows
that
the
spoken
word
still
has
something
that
the
written
one
ca
convey
is
there
a
mincing
mind
of
which
a
mincing
voice
is
the
outward
and
visible
warning
it
was
interesting
that
the
last
few
years
of
gilbert
life
should
have
furnished
this
unique
opportunity
of
contact
through
the
spoken
word
between
him
and
the
english
people
his
voice
on
the
radio
had
none
of
the
defects
that
marred
it
in
a
hall
his
material
was
far
better
arranged
his
delivery
perfect
he
seemed
to
be
there
beside
the
listener
talking
in
amity
and
exchanging
confidences
the
morning
after
his
death
edward
macdonald
passed
a
barber
shop
off
chancery
lane
the
man
was
lathering
a
customer
face
but
recognising
macdonald
left
the
customer
and
ran
out
brush
in
hand
i
just
want
to
say
i
was
sorry
to
hear
the
news
he
said
he
was
a
grand
man
macdonald
asked
him
if
he
knew
chesterton
well
never
read
a
word
he
wrote
the
barber
answered
but
i
always
listened
to
him
on
the
wireless
he
seemed
to
be
sitting
beside
me
in
the
room
that
man
edward
macdonald
comments
emphasised
what
i
still
think
that
in
another
year
or
so
would
have
become
the
dominating
voice
from
broadcasting
house
in
gilbert
had
jaundice
and
on
his
recovery
he
started
with
frances
and
dorothy
on
one
of
those
trips
that
were
his
greatest
pleasure
they
went
to
rome
it
was
holy
year
and
thence
to
sicily
intending
to
go
on
to
palestine
at
syracuse
however
gilbert
became
really
ill
with
inflammation
of
the
nerves
of
the
neck
and
shoulders
they
stayed
five
weeks
in
syracuse
gave
up
the
trip
to
palestine
and
returned
home
by
malta
gilbert
and
frances
were
to
have
dined
at
admiralty
house
but
he
was
too
unwell
to
dine
out
and
only
came
up
one
afternoon
lady
fisher
remembers
going
to
see
them
at
the
osborne
hotel
gilbert
was
sitting
on
a
rickety
basket
chair
obviously
in
pain
and
talking
a
good
deal
in
order
to
hide
it
she
sympathised
with
him
for
the
cold
weather
his
obvious
physical
misery
and
the
discomfort
of
his
chair
you
must
never
sympathise
with
me
gilbert
answered
for
i
can
always
turn
every
chair
into
a
story
the
next
year
they
motored
in
france
and
italy
and
gilbert
records
in
the
an
experience
in
a
french
café
when
he
felt
a
rare
thrill
not
in
talking
on
the
radio
but
in
listening
on
a
day
that
was
dateless
even
for
my
dateless
life
for
i
had
forgotten
time
and
had
no
notion
of
anything
anywhere
when
in
a
small
french
town
i
strolled
into
a
café
noisy
with
french
talk
wireless
songs
wailed
unnoted
which
is
not
surprising
for
french
talk
is
much
better
than
wireless
and
then
unaccountably
i
heard
a
voice
speaking
in
english
and
a
voice
i
had
heard
before
for
i
heard
the
words
wherever
you
are
my
dear
people
whether
in
this
country
or
beyond
the
sea
and
i
remembered
monarchy
and
an
ancient
cry
for
it
was
the
king
and
that
is
how
i
kept
the
jubilee
after
he
got
home
i
remember
how
delightedly
gilbert
quoted
the
captions
on
two
banners
hung
in
the
heart
of
the
london
slums
one
read
down
with
capitalism
god
save
the
king
the
other
read
lousy
but
loyal
he
knew
that
it
was
true
and
it
served
to
increase
the
passionate
quality
of
his
pity
patient
he
could
be
for
himself
but
the
lot
of
the
poor
aroused
in
him
a
terrible
anger
and
in
a
broadcast
on
liberty
he
gave
that
anger
vent
for
worse
than
the
presence
of
lice
in
our
slums
was
the
absence
of
liberty
he
would
gladly
he
said
have
spoken
merely
as
an
englishman
but
he
had
been
asked
to
speak
as
a
catholic
and
therefore
i
am
going
to
point
out
that
catholicism
created
english
liberty
that
the
freedom
has
remained
exactly
in
so
far
as
the
faith
has
remained
and
that
where
it
is
true
that
all
our
faith
has
gone
all
our
freedom
is
going
if
i
do
this
i
can
not
ask
most
of
you
to
agree
with
me
if
i
did
anything
else
i
could
not
ask
any
of
you
to
respect
me
other
speakers
in
the
series
had
dwelt
on
the
liberty
secured
to
englishmen
by
our
parliamentary
and
juridical
system
both
he
noted
of
catholic
origin
but
in
his
eyes
even
that
liberty
was
being
imperilled
today
where
it
was
not
lost
while
the
most
important
freedom
of
all
freedom
to
handle
oneself
and
one
daily
life
had
disappeared
for
the
mass
of
the
people
the
liberty
so
widely
praised
that
followed
the
reformation
has
been
a
limited
liberty
because
it
was
only
a
literary
liberty
you
always
talked
about
verbal
liberty
you
hardly
ever
talked
about
vital
liberty
the
faddist
was
free
to
preach
his
fads
but
the
free
man
was
no
longer
free
to
protect
his
freedom
monarchy
aristocracy
democracy
responsible
forms
of
rule
have
collapsed
under
plutocracy
which
is
irresponsible
rule
and
this
has
come
upon
us
because
we
departed
from
the
old
morality
in
three
essential
points
first
we
supported
notions
against
normal
customs
second
we
made
the
state
with
a
new
and
secretive
tyranny
of
wealth
and
third
we
forgot
that
there
is
no
faith
in
freedom
without
faith
in
free
will
a
servile
fatalism
dogs
the
creed
of
materialism
because
nothing
as
dante
said
less
than
the
generosity
of
god
could
give
to
man
after
all
ordinary
orderly
gifts
the
noblest
of
all
things
which
is
liberty
the
thoughts
that
had
thronged
and
pressed
on
him
for
half
a
century
found
final
expression
in
these
broadcasts
most
of
all
in
two
talks
one
given
only
three
months
before
his
death
in
a
series
entitled
the
spice
of
life
the
other
two
years
earlier
in
one
called
seven
days
hard
he
was
haunted
by
the
ingratitude
of
humanity
as
in
his
boyhood
he
saw
the
wonder
of
the
world
that
god
has
given
to
the
children
of
men
and
he
saw
them
unconscious
of
that
wonder
what
did
a
week
mean
for
most
of
them
seven
dull
days
what
did
it
really
mean
what
has
really
happened
during
the
last
seven
days
and
nights
seven
times
we
have
been
dissolved
into
darkness
as
we
shall
be
dissolved
into
dust
our
very
selves
so
far
as
we
know
have
been
wiped
out
of
the
world
of
living
things
and
seven
times
we
have
been
raised
alive
like
lazarus
and
found
all
our
limbs
and
senses
unaltered
with
the
coming
of
the
day
seven
days
of
human
life
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
the
spice
of
life
both
brought
the
same
recurring
motif
that
a
great
many
people
are
at
this
moment
paying
rather
too
much
attention
to
the
spice
of
life
and
rather
too
little
attention
to
life
not
in
any
distraction
from
life
is
the
secret
we
are
all
seeking
the
secret
of
enjoying
life
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
all
our
world
will
end
in
despair
unless
there
is
some
way
of
making
the
mind
itself
the
ordinary
thoughts
we
have
at
ordinary
times
more
healthy
and
more
happy
than
they
seem
to
be
just
now
to
judge
by
most
modern
novels
and
poems
a
week
had
never
been
for
chesterton
just
seven
days
hard
although
he
had
worked
hard
enough
he
had
enjoyed
the
spice
of
life
he
had
liked
beer
and
skittles
and
the
distractions
of
life
and
its
high
points
of
achievement
but
it
is
much
more
important
to
remember
that
i
have
been
intensely
and
imaginatively
happy
in
the
queerest
because
the
quietest
places
i
have
been
filled
with
life
from
within
in
a
cold
in
a
deserted
railway
junction
i
have
been
completely
alive
sitting
on
an
iron
seat
under
an
ugly
at
a
third
rate
watering
place
in
short
i
have
experienced
the
mere
excitement
of
existence
in
places
that
would
commonly
be
called
as
dull
as
ditchwater
and
by
the
way
is
ditchwater
dull
naturalists
with
microscopes
have
told
me
that
it
teems
with
quiet
fun
the
younger
generation
were
despairing
of
life
in
the
face
of
manifold
gifts
chesterton
as
a
youth
had
revolted
against
the
pessimism
of
his
elders
now
he
revolted
as
an
old
man
against
a
young
generation
corroded
by
a
yet
more
poisonous
pessimism
the
hollow
men
eliot
had
called
a
poem
and
in
it
came
the
lines
this
is
the
way
the
world
ends
this
is
the
way
the
world
ends
this
is
the
way
the
world
ends
not
with
a
bang
but
a
whimper
forgive
me
if
i
say
in
my
old
world
fashion
that
i
damned
if
i
ever
felt
like
that
i
knew
that
the
world
was
perishable
and
would
end
but
i
did
not
think
it
would
end
with
a
whimper
but
if
anything
with
a
trump
of
doom
i
will
even
be
so
indecently
frivolous
as
to
burst
into
song
and
say
to
the
young
pessimists
some
sneer
some
snigger
some
simper
in
the
youth
where
we
laughed
and
sang
and
they
may
end
with
a
whimper
but
we
will
end
with
a
bang
his
last
message
for
this
generation
was
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
calling
us
to
resurrection
a
dead
world
must
find
life
again
must
go
back
to
the
meaning
of
the
book
of
genesis
at
which
it
had
learnt
to
sneer
must
realise
a
week
once
more
with
the
grandeur
of
that
conception
by
which
a
week
has
become
a
wonderful
and
mystical
thing
in
which
man
imitates
god
in
his
labour
and
in
his
rest
through
his
call
sounds
a
note
of
most
solemn
warning
unless
we
can
bring
men
back
to
enjoying
the
daily
life
which
moderns
call
a
dull
life
our
whole
civilisation
will
be
in
ruins
in
about
fifteen
years
whenever
anybody
proposes
anything
really
practical
to
solve
the
economic
evil
today
the
answer
always
is
that
the
solution
would
not
work
because
the
modern
town
populations
would
think
life
dull
that
is
because
they
are
entirely
unacquainted
with
life
they
know
nothing
but
distractions
from
life
dreams
which
may
be
found
in
the
cinema
that
is
brief
oblivions
of
life
unless
we
can
make
daybreak
and
daily
bread
and
the
creative
secrets
of
labour
interesting
in
themselves
there
will
fall
on
all
our
civilisation
a
fatigue
which
is
the
one
disease
from
which
civilisations
do
not
recover
so
died
the
great
pagan
civilisation
of
bread
and
circuses
and
forgetfulness
of
the
household
gods
january
this
splendid
world
that
god
has
given
us
and
the
furniture
of
it
as
the
writer
of
genesis
saw
it
in
his
vision
has
in
it
the
material
of
happiness
in
labour
and
in
the
true
end
of
labour
for
the
true
end
of
all
creation
is
completion
and
the
true
end
of
all
completion
is
contemplation
chapter
xxxii
last
days
dorothy
told
me
one
day
in
that
gilbert
had
written
the
beginning
of
an
autobiography
some
years
before
but
had
laid
it
aside
she
had
she
said
a
superstitious
feeling
about
urging
him
to
get
on
with
it
as
though
the
survey
of
his
life
and
the
end
of
his
life
would
somehow
be
tied
together
i
urged
her
to
get
over
this
feeling
because
of
all
the
book
would
mean
to
the
world
after
this
talk
she
got
out
the
manuscript
and
laid
it
on
gilbert
desk
he
read
what
he
had
written
and
immediately
set
about
dictating
the
rest
of
the
book
early
in
he
told
a
group
of
friends
that
the
book
was
finished
one
of
them
said
nunc
dimittis
and
edward
macdonald
who
was
present
commented
the
words
were
chilling
though
he
seemed
to
be
in
fairly
good
health
but
certainly
he
was
tired
the
book
showed
no
sign
of
fatigue
and
intensely
amusing
it
seemed
to
promise
many
more
for
into
almost
old
age
he
had
carried
the
imagination
and
energy
in
which
as
a
very
young
man
we
saw
his
resemblance
to
the
youthful
dickens
reviewing
his
life
with
the
thread
of
thanksgiving
that
had
been
his
clue
throughout
he
looked
back
on
it
as
indefensibly
happy
and
it
was
in
truth
a
rich
and
full
human
existence
yet
father
vincent
who
knew
him
intimately
speaks
of
him
in
these
last
years
as
heartbroken
by
public
events
as
suffering
with
the
pains
of
creation
he
was
crucified
to
his
thought
like
thomas
he
was
never
away
from
his
thought
a
fellow
friar
had
to
care
for
thomas
to
feed
him
nutrix
because
of
his
absorption
in
his
thought
thus
father
vincent
saw
frances
cherishing
gilbert
both
mind
and
body
a
friend
protesting
vehemently
against
the
phrase
crucified
to
his
thought
says
it
was
his
beatitude
to
observe
and
ponder
and
conclude
of
his
own
paradoxes
gilbert
was
wont
to
maintain
that
it
was
god
not
he
who
made
them
and
here
we
have
surely
one
of
the
paradoxes
of
human
life
intense
vitality
joy
in
living
vigor
of
creative
thought
bring
to
their
owners
immense
happiness
acute
suffering
is
it
not
a
part
of
the
most
fundamental
of
all
antinomies
the
greatness
and
the
littleness
of
man
created
for
eternity
and
prisoned
in
time
we
have
no
perfect
joy
in
this
world
and
the
reaching
upward
and
outward
of
the
mind
is
at
once
the
keenest
joy
and
the
fiercest
pain
rather
as
we
talk
of
growing
pains
only
gilbert
loved
to
grow
so
much
that
he
would
not
think
of
the
pain
you
must
never
pity
me
he
said
to
lady
fisher
and
all
through
his
life
he
was
saying
and
meaning
you
must
never
pity
me
but
while
he
was
writing
the
and
giving
thanks
for
his
life
its
last
months
were
shadowed
by
trials
especially
heavy
for
a
man
of
his
imagination
and
temperament
for
now
more
than
ever
his
thought
was
not
allowed
to
concentrate
on
those
realities
where
the
joy
of
contemplation
overpowers
the
pain
of
growth
he
loved
italy
even
more
than
france
he
says
in
one
letter
yet
he
could
not
but
condemn
the
invasion
of
abyssinia
the
shadow
of
the
spanish
war
loomed
on
the
horizon
and
behind
it
a
darker
shadow
in
his
political
thinking
chesterton
was
haunted
by
the
present
war
then
too
while
public
controversy
did
not
trouble
him
at
all
he
hated
any
breach
of
the
peace
within
the
ranks
of
his
own
small
army
the
fights
among
the
staff
of
the
paper
about
distributism
had
been
as
nothing
compared
with
those
about
abyssiania
there
are
leading
articles
taking
one
line
and
letters
in
the
cockpit
in
violent
opposition
maurice
reckitt
writes
in
it
happened
in
the
last
autumn
of
his
life
i
wrote
to
him
privately
in
distress
at
the
line
which
the
was
taking
on
abyssinia
and
saying
that
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
leave
the
board
as
i
was
so
much
out
of
sympathy
with
this
i
received
this
reply
from
which
i
have
deleted
only
some
personal
references
top
meadow
beaconsfield
september
my
dear
maurice
reckitt
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
the
delay
in
answering
your
most
important
letter
involving
as
it
does
tragic
dooms
of
separation
which
i
hope
need
not
be
fulfilled
i
should
like
to
ask
you
to
defer
your
decision
at
least
until
you
have
seen
the
next
number
of
the
paper
in
which
i
expand
further
the
argument
i
have
used
in
the
current
number
and
bring
it
i
think
rather
nearer
to
your
natural
and
justifiable
point
of
view
between
ourselves
and
without
prejudice
to
anybody
i
do
think
myself
that
there
ought
to
have
been
a
more
definite
condemnation
of
the
attack
on
abyssinia
the
whole
thing
happened
while
i
was
having
a
holiday
very
shortly
the
mortal
danger
to
me
is
the
rehabilitation
of
capitalism
in
spite
of
the
slump
which
will
certainly
take
the
form
of
a
hypocritical
patriotism
and
glorification
of
england
at
the
expense
of
italy
or
anybody
else
for
the
moment
i
only
want
you
to
understand
that
this
is
the
mountainous
peril
that
towers
in
my
own
mind
yours
always
k
chesterton
three
months
later
in
he
wrote
about
the
whole
matter
in
an
article
in
which
he
treated
the
question
as
largely
one
of
proportion
not
enough
was
being
said
in
england
of
her
own
or
the
league
position
about
japan
attack
on
china
too
much
in
proportion
about
italy
in
abyssinia
if
the
league
of
nations
really
were
an
impartial
judicial
authority
and
if
what
is
about
as
probable
i
were
one
of
the
judges
and
if
the
abyssinian
case
were
brought
before
me
i
should
decide
instantly
against
italy
i
have
again
and
again
in
this
place
stated
in
the
strongest
words
the
particular
case
against
italy
he
was
against
italy
in
abyssinia
as
he
had
been
against
england
in
south
africa
but
i
should
not
be
bound
to
rejoice
at
the
prussians
riding
into
paris
because
it
might
prevent
the
british
riding
into
pretoria
tragic
dooms
of
separation
on
public
issues
were
not
the
only
trouble
with
weekly
the
staff
were
also
engaged
in
violent
personal
quarrels
about
which
gilbert
was
asked
to
take
sides
was
even
bitterly
reproached
by
one
for
supposedly
favouring
another
it
would
be
hard
today
to
say
what
it
was
all
about
but
two
of
the
contestants
have
told
me
since
that
had
they
had
the
least
notion
how
ill
he
was
getting
they
would
have
died
rather
than
so
distress
him
for
it
was
a
real
and
a
very
deep
distress
it
may
be
remembered
that
miss
dunham
noted
how
gilbert
used
to
make
a
mysterious
sign
in
the
air
as
he
lit
his
cigar
that
sign
says
dorothy
was
the
sign
of
the
cross
long
ago
he
had
written
of
human
life
as
something
not
grey
and
drab
but
shot
through
with
strong
and
even
violent
colours
that
took
the
pattern
of
the
cross
he
saw
the
cross
signed
by
god
on
the
trees
as
their
branches
spread
to
right
and
left
he
saw
it
signed
by
man
as
he
shaped
a
paling
or
a
door
post
the
habit
grew
upon
him
of
making
it
constantly
in
the
air
with
his
match
as
he
lit
his
cigar
over
a
cup
of
coffee
as
he
entered
a
room
he
would
make
on
the
door
the
sign
of
our
redemption
no
we
must
never
pity
him
even
when
his
life
was
pressed
upon
by
that
sign
which
stands
for
joy
through
pain
those
nearest
to
him
grew
anxious
quite
early
in
he
was
overtired
and
working
with
the
weary
insistence
that
can
bring
the
remedy
so
often
successful
of
a
trip
to
the
continent
was
tried
they
went
to
lourdes
and
lisieux
and
he
seemed
better
and
sang
a
good
deal
in
his
tuneless
voice
as
dorothy
drove
them
through
the
lanes
of
france
from
lisieux
he
wrote
a
pencilled
letter
long
and
almost
illegible
under
the
shadow
of
the
shrine
trying
to
reconcile
the
disputants
with
himself
and
with
one
another
the
summer
was
cold
and
bleak
and
the
tour
was
all
too
short
home
again
his
mind
seemed
not
to
grip
as
well
as
usual
and
he
began
to
fall
asleep
during
his
long
hours
of
work
the
doctor
was
called
and
thought
very
seriously
of
the
state
of
his
heart
that
heart
which
many
years
ago
another
doctor
had
called
too
small
for
his
enormous
frame
the
thought
of
a
chesterton
whose
heart
was
too
small
presents
a
paradox
in
his
own
best
manner
to
edward
macdonald
who
had
missed
a
message
that
he
was
too
ill
to
be
visited
gilbert
talked
in
his
old
fashion
and
promised
a
poem
he
had
just
thought
of
for
the
paper
on
martin
of
tours
the
point
is
that
he
was
a
true
distributist
he
gave
his
cloak
to
the
beggar
soon
after
this
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
reverie
from
which
awaking
he
said
the
issue
is
now
quite
clear
it
is
between
light
and
darkness
and
every
one
must
choose
his
side
frances
and
he
had
both
thought
his
recovery
in
was
a
miracle
i
did
not
dare
said
frances
to
pray
for
another
miracle
monsignor
smith
anointed
him
and
then
father
vincent
arrived
in
response
to
a
message
from
frances
which
he
thought
meant
she
wanted
him
to
see
gilbert
for
the
last
time
taken
to
the
sick
room
he
sang
over
the
dying
man
the
salve
regina
this
hymn
to
our
lady
is
sung
in
the
dominican
order
over
every
dying
friar
and
it
was
surely
fitting
for
the
biographer
of
thomas
and
the
ardent
suppliant
of
our
lady
salve
regina
mater
misericordiae

gilbert
pen
lay
on
the
table
beside
his
bed
and
father
vincent
picked
it
up
and
kissed
it
it
was
june
the
sunday
within
the
octave
of
corpus
christi
the
same
feast
as
his
reception
into
the
church
fourteen
years
earlier
the
introit
for
that
day
mass
was
printed
on
his
memorial
card
so
that
as
father
ignatius
rice
noted
with
a
smile
even
his
memorial
card
had
a
joke
about
his
size
the
lord
became
my
protector
and
he
brought
me
forth
into
a
large
place
he
saved
me
because
he
was
well
pleased
with
me
i
will
love
thee
o
lord
my
strength
the
lord
is
my
firmament
and
my
refuge
and
my
deliverer
to
these
words
from
the
mass

the

was
one
of

one
of

would
have
said
to
frances
grey
days
were
his
when
nature

he
said
were
brightest
against
her
more
sombre
background
sunny
days
were
hers
for
she
loved
a
blue
blazing
sky
the
little
church
near
the
railway
was
filled
to
overflowing
by
his
friends
from
london
from
all
over
england
from
france
even
and
from
america
all
beaconsfield
wanted
to
honour
him
so
the
funeral
procession
instead
of
taking
the
direct
route
passed
through
the
old
town
where
he
had
so
often
sat
in
the
barber
shop
and
chatted
with
his
fellow
citizens
at
top
meadow
we
gathered
to
talk
frances
a
few
of
us
saw
for
a
little
while
in
her
own

with
that
utter
that
was

she
said
to
her
it
was
so
much
worse

my
friend
hesketh
pearson
was
staying
with
me
when
i
read
of
chesterton
death
i
told
him
of
it
through
the
bathroom
door
and
he
sent
up
a
hollow
groan
which
must
have
echoed
that
morning
all
over
england
it
was
with
reason
that
the
pope
offered
his
sympathy
not
to
catholics
alone
but
to
all
the
people
of
england
to
the
policeman
who
said
at
the
funeral
all
have
been
here
if
we
could
have
got
off
duty
he
was
a
grand
man
to
the
man
at
the
office
who
broke
in
on
the
announcement
of
his
death
good
god
that
is
chesterton
is
it
to
the
barber
who
had
to
leave
his
customer
unshaved
that
he
might
talk
to
edward
macdonald
to
all
of
us
his
friends
on
whom
the
loss
lay
almost
unbearably
heavy
to
those
for
whom
his
presence
would
have
pierced
and
lightened
even
the
dark
shadow
of
the
war
to
all
the
people
of
england
once
more
a
pope
had
bestowed
upon
an
englishman
the
title
defender
of
the
faith
the
first
man
to
receive
it
had
been
henry
viii
and
the
words
are
still
engraved
on
the
coins
of
england
the
secular
press
would
not
print
the
telegram
in
full
because
it
bestowed
upon
a
subject
a
royal
title
after
gilbert
death
frances
tried
to
take
up

again
she
visited
her
cousins
in
germany
a
university
professor
and
his

who
were
undergoing
the
persecution
of
the
swastika
she
was
deeply
moved
by
their

and
the
peril
they
stood

appendix
a
an
earlier
chesterton
both
the
and
of
george
laval
chesterton
are
worth
reading
there
is
conscious
humour
we
feel
it
might
be
our
own
chesterton
when
we
hear
the
captain
describing
himself
as
laughing
immoderately
because
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
others
were
laughing
at
him
there
is
unconscious
humour
especially
in
the
astonishing
style
full
of
such
phrases
as
i
was
the
most
obnoxious
to
peril
or
something
not
far
removed
from
impunity
stalked
abroad
captain
chesterton
started
life
as
a
soldier
during
the
peninsular
war
his
regiment
was
stationed
at
cartagena
it
was
a
subject
of
deep
mortification
to
most
of
us
to
be
thus
supinely
occupied
in
this
lone
garrison
thereby
being
debarred
from
the
peninsular
medal
and
hence
a
widespread
disaffection
on
that
most
tender
subject
which
no
reasoning
has
been
equal
to
dispel
however
later
he
saw
a
good
deal
of
active
service
being
in
the
war
of
in
the
course
of
which
the
battle
of
bladensburg
was
fought
and
washington
fell
to
the
british
arms
the
astonished
slaves
he
says
describing
the
advance
on
washington
rested
from
their
work
in
the
fields
contiguous
and
the
peasants
and
yeomen
of
this
portion
of
america
beheld
with
perturbation
the
tremendous
preparations
to
devastate
their
blooming
country
to
the
smaller
professional
armies
of
that
day
peace
was
a
misfortune
and
in
his
quaint
style
captain
chesterton
describes
the
demonstrations
of
joy
on
the
part
of
himself
and
his
fellow
officers
at
the
escape
of
napoleon
from
elba
foreseeing
as
he
frankly
observes
a
scope
for
further
adventure
and
hope
of
personal
advancement
this
hope
was
and
we
next
see
him
fighting
in
the
british
legion
of
a
rebel
south
american
army
against
spain
the
general
mismanagement
of
this
expedition
and
the
fact
that
the
republicans
killed
all
their
prisoners
was
a
death
blow
to
all
my
past
enthusiasm
in
the
republican
cause
many
british
officers
participating
with
me
in
the
detestation
for
butchery
conspired
from
that
moment
to
elude
this
detested
service
mark
ye
who
delight
in
transcendant
liberalism
the
cruel
exigencies
of
such
a
warfare
in
his
acceptance
of
transcendant
liberalism
yet
his
determination
to
see
truly
what
passed
before
his
eyes
and
when
needful
to
change
his
standpoint
this
earlier
chesterton
was
much
like
the
later
he
had
not
the
genius
of
gilbert
he
could
not
see
so
far
but
he
shared
his
refusal
to
be
blinded
by
custom
theory
or
even
patriotism
in
his
accounts
of
army
life
he
had
commented
fearlessly
on
the
cruelty
of
the
punishments
and
described
his
fellow
officers
as
made
ill
by
seeing
a
private
receive
five
hundred
lashes
he
had
noted
corruption
in
the
train
service
which
was
consequently
divested
of
its
genuine
claim
to
honour
fêted
by
the
planters
of
jamaica
he
had
yet
spoken
with
horror
of
their
slave
ownership
now
he
was
appointed
governor
of
a
prison
in
england
and
here
began
the
great
work
of
his
life
in
a
frontal
attack
on
the
corruptions
he
discovered
the
yardsmen
did
a
secret
traffic
in
all
the
goods
forbidden
in
the
prison
there
were
caches
of
tobacco
spirits
and
such
things
under
the
pavements
the
weaker
prisoners
were
robbed
by
the
stronger
the
women
and
men
quarters
were
so
arranged
that
by
connivance
of
the
jailors
frequent
meetings
took
place
on
one
of
these
occasions
captain
chesterton
himself
appeared
my
hands
were
seized
with
tender
empressement
and
i
was
addressed
as
my
love
my
darling
my
dear
creature
and
all
the
conventional
endearments
of
the
pavé
were
showered
upon
me
i
had
to
struggle
for
enlargement
and
beat
a
hasty
retreat
quite
confounded
by
my
initiation
into
prison
discipline
and
the
consternation
occasioned
by
this
discovery
became
perfectly
electric
of
prison
pp
attempts
to
bribe
him
were
followed
by
attempts
to
kill
him
but
he
stood
firm
fry
invoked
his
aid
to
improve
the
home
conditions
to
which
the
prisoners
had
to
return
chesterton
turned
to
dickens
and
to
dickens
friend
miss
coutts
in
defiance
of
a
magistrate
who
perversely
insisted
as
was
by
cynical
interpretation
literally
too
true
that
miss
coutts
had
no
right
to
confer
with
prisoners
within
those
walls
nor
was
it
to
be
tolerated
that
charles

more
tenaciously

his

the

died
in

in

and
the
old
twilight
sank
and
settled
over

he
left
his

a

that
dies

amid

with

he

appendix
c
the
chestertons
the
composition
of
is
not
without
interest
for
the
student
of
legendary
literature
by
a
curious
paradox
the
book
had
to
be
strikingly
untrue
to
be
accepted
as
true
since
the
jokes
about
are
legion
so
that
mere
commonplace
shafts
of
what
is
called
feminine
spite
would
have
gained
little
credence
yet
on
the
other
hand
cecil
chesterton
was
able
to
quote
to
get
from
her
husband
a
good
deal
of
corroborative
detail
designed
to
give
verisimilitude
to
an
otherwise
bald
and
unconvincing
narrative
of
these
details
some
are
true
some
false
all
arranged
to
support
the
main
untruth
of
frances
and
gilbert
relation
to
one
another
the
thesis
of
the
book
is
that
gilbert
was
an
unhappy
and
frustrated
man
a
because
frances
shrank
from
consummating
their
marriage
and
b
because
she
dragged
him
away
from
his
london
life
and
friends
to
bury
him
in
a
middle
class
suburb
i
confess
that
i
am
victorian
enough
heartily
to
dislike
writing
this
appendix
yet
it
is
necessary
for
many
who
read
have
supposed
that
a
story
told
by
so
near
a
connection
must
be
true
the
ground
was
laid
for
the
introduction
of
the
legend
by
the
tale
of
the
red
haired
phantom
if
i
may
describe
it
in
the
terms
of
a
ghost
story
that
ghost
was
easy
to
lay
see
introduction
next
comes
the
odd
account
of
gilbert
and
frances
honeymoon
and
of
the
years
that
followed
it
is
of
course
possible
that
the
first
night
of
their
marriage
was
not
happy
especially
in
the
victorian
days
of
reticence
which
left
wife
and
even
possibly
husband
unprepared
for
life
together
though
this
did
not
normally
prevent
a
happy
marriage
and
a
pack
of
children
afterwards
but
i
find
it
impossible
to
imagine
cecil
chesterton
like
the
bridesmaid
on
the
honeymoon
receiving
and
passing
on
such
a
story
as
that
of
gilbert
quivering
with
so
that
after
the
first
night
he
dared
not
even
contemplate
a
repetition
gilbert
young
and
vital
was
condemned
to
a
life
in
which
he
lived
with
a
woman
but
never
enjoyed
one
there
is
a
psychological
reason
for
thinking
this
story
especially
improbable
and
a
physical
reason
for
dismissing
it
as
actually
impossible
a
white
horse
had
from
his
childhood
been
for
gilbert
the
supreme
sign
of
romance
and
he
had
chosen
to
spend
the
first
night
of
his
honeymoon
at
the
white
horse
inn
from
his
honeymoon
he
wrote
home
that
he
had
a
wife
a
piece
of
string
a
pencil
and
a
knife
what
more
can
any
man
want
ten
years
later
he
wrote
ballad
of
the
white
and
dedicated
it
to
frances
saying
o
go
you
onward
where
you
are
shall
honour
and
laughter
be
past
purpled
forest
and
pearled
foam
god
winged
pavilion
free
to
roam
your
face
that
is
a
wandering
home
a
flying
home
for
me
and
over
thirty
years
later
he
wrote
again
of
beginning
his
honeymoon
under
the
shadow
of
the
white
horse
and
compared
it
to
a
trip
to
fairyland
can
any
human
being
read
the
record
of
this
recurrent
motif
and
reconcile
it
with
cecil
picture
let
me
refer
again
to
ballad
of
the
white
is
it
conceivable
that
any
man
should
write
after
ten
years
of
frustration
and
unhappiness
up
through
an
empty
house
of
stars
being
what
heart
you
are
up
the
inhuman
steeps
of
space
as
on
a
staircase
go
in
grace
carrying
the
firelight
on
your
face
beyond
the
loneliest
star
this
is
not
the
way
a
man
writes
to
a
neurotic
woman
who
has
made
a
hermit
of
him
cecil
was
of
course
never
in
the
intimacy
of
the
family
she
only
married
cecil
in
by
which
date
gilbert
and
frances
had
been
married
sixteen
years
and
before
that
she
was
merely
an
acquaintance
but
frances
intimates
could
have
told
her
how
absurd
her
story
was
for
by
a
rare
good
fortune
the
operation
frances
underwent
to
enable
her
to
bear
children
is
itself
evidence
one
could
hardly
have
hoped
for
in
a
matter
which
civilized
people
are
not
much
given
to
discussing
frances
talked
of
the
operation
to
monsignor
to
dorothy
collins
and
to
annie
firmin
and
i
have
quoted
the
doctor
letter
about
it
see
above
chapter
xv
it
was
an
abiding
tragedy
for
both
husband
and
wife
that
it
was
unsuccessful
frances
would
have
shrunk
from
no
suffering
in
her
passionate
wish
for
a
child
there
is
another
curiosity
in
the
legend
gilbert
despite
this
story
was
apparently
perfectly
happy
in
london
during
the
eight
years
of
marriage
it
was
only
after
the
removal
to
beaconsfield
and
in
almost
middle
life
that
he
began
to
be
frustrated
poor
frances
what
a
picture
of
her
had
been
proposed
for
posterity
so
powerful
she
could
waft
gilbert
away
from
london
and
from
his
friends
could
force
him
to
make
her
his
banker
and
reduce
him
to
a
bounty
strictly
limited
to
yet
so
powerless
that
she
had
to
sign
the
cheques
for
much
as
she
hated
it
her
poetry
described
as
quite
charming
is
spoken
of
as
appearing
in
little
parish
magazines
the
only
papers
she
cared
to
read
owing
to
her
implacable
hatred
for
fleet
street
it
is
hard
to
picture
frances
with
an
implacable
hatred
for
anything
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
she
actually
begged
father
to
leave
gilbert
to
be
a
jolly
journalist
the
periodicals
in
which
her
poems
appeared
were
sunday
daily
chronicle
the
and
new
personally
i
have
never
much
admired
frances
verse
but
a
professional
journalist
might
have
been
quite
pleased
at
making
all
these
papers
not
one
poem
ever
appeared
in
a
parish
magazine
so
far
as
either
dorothy
or
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
the
point
is
not
a
very
important
one
but
the
sneer
is
symptomatic
a
curious
magic
pervades
chestertons
succulent
sausages
appear
in
the
kitchen
at
overstrand
mansions
and
flowing
torrents
of
beer
so
that
gilbert
can
steal
away
from
an
unsympathetic
wife
to
consume
them
with
his
fleet
street
friends
a
studio
materialises
in
a
meadow
at
beaconsfield
can
we
imagine
gilbert
cooking
or
even
ordering
sausages
getting
beer
to
the
flat
designing
or
discovering
the
studio
anyone
thinking
about
what
really
happened
would
realise
that
frances
ordered
the
beer
and
sausages
frances
built
the
studio
but
that
is
not
the
sort
of
thought
we
are
to
think
about
frances
about
her
we
are
told
that
she
always
wore
the
wrong
colors
that
she
gave
gilbert
insufficient
and
indigestible
food
that
she
did
not
know
what
work
meant
that
belloc
thought
gilbert
ought
to
beat
her
that
she
kept
the
journalists
away
when
gilbert
was
dying
in
point
of
fact
both
telephone
and
door
bell
were
so
near
the
sick
room
that
the
use
of
both
had
to
be
avoided
that
she
did
not
give
her
guests
enough
to
eat
at
his
funeral
that
she
actually
sought
the
quiet
of
her
own
room
instead
of
staying
downstairs
to
receive
condolences
when
her
husband
coffin
had
just
been
lowered
into
the
grave
with
all
this
spate
of
detail
we
are
not
told
that
frances
left
to
cecil
plus
for
her
cecil
houses
even
if
i
could
have
ignored
the
attack
on
frances
i
should
be
obliged
as
his
biographer
to
deal
with
the
attack
on
gilbert
more
subtly
but
no
less
certainly
made
the
story
of
the
marriage
affects
gilbert
as
much
as
frances
and
the
book
culminates
in
the
final
assertion
that
his
drinking
killed
him
here
are
the
comments
sent
to
me
by
dorothy
of
the
doctor
who
attended
gilbert
and
frances
from
until
they
died
today
bakewell
came
in
and
answered
the
questions
about
the
book
which
we
asked
him
he
says
that
the
idea
that
was
better
when
drinking
in
fleet
street
because
the
stimulus
of
conversation
would
eat
up
effects
of
the
alcohol
is
absolute
nonsense
it
would
have
just
as
bad
an
effect
under
any
conditions
bakewell
said
that
was
his
patient
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
during
that
time
he
never
treated
him
for
alcoholism
or
saw
any
trace
of
it
though
in
an
absentminded
way
he
was
always
liable
to
drink
too
much
of
anything
if
it
were
there
even
water
without
the
loving
tactful
care
of
frances
he
would
have
died
twenty
years
before
certainly
if
he
had
racketted
around
fleet
street
any
longer
bakewell
said
gilbert
was
happy
in
beaconsfield
and
not
in
any
way
frustrated
there
was
no
frustration
of
any
kind
and
no
longing
for
london
life
or
friends
he
was
very
intimate
with
gilbert
and
would
have
known
if
there
had
been
the
doctor
says
that
gilbert
died
of
a
failing
heart
owing
to
fatty
degeneration
leading
to
dropsy
frances
had
arthritis
of
the
spine
not
curvature
as
stated
by
mrs
cecil
the
doctor
said
that
he
put
him
on
the
water
wagon
several
times
and
when
this
was
done
gilbert
observed
the
rule
most
meticulously
bakewell
said
that
he
did
not
do
it
very
often
because
he
did
not
consider
that
drink
was
in
any
way
affecting
gilbert
health
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
he
knew
him
in
a
later
conversation
he
added
that
when
he
did
forbid
alcohol
at
certain
periods
it
was
simply
to
make
liquid
less
attractive
as
too
much
of
even
water
was
bad
for
gilbert
the
statement
made
by
cecil
that
drinking
in
london
was
not
so
serious
because
the
talk
and
excitement
among
friends
would
carry
off
the
effects
is
thought
by
doctors
almost
comic
bakewell
denies
it
absolutely
pocock
who
it
will
be
remembered
attended
gilbert
during
his
illness
of
says
absolute
nonsense
would
probably
have
been
worse
in
london
he
adds
also
i
can
not
understand
why
such
an
attack
was
made
upon
from
my
personal
observation
he
owed
a
very
great
deal
to
who
greatly
helped
his
restoration
to
health
one
can
get
one
of
fun
out
of
the
chapter
on
the
exile
of
beaconsfield
when
one
remembers
the
true
story
of
those
years

one
can
only
suppose
that
cecil
was
so
little
intimate
with
them
that
she
did
not

meanwhile
the

poured

the
little
study
cecil
thinks
gilbert
hardly
ever
again
wrote
a
masterpiece
after
leaving
battersea
yet
in
support
of
this
idea
she
lists
as
masterpieces

written

written

and
ballad
of
the
white
mainly
written
at
beaconsfield
of
all
the
books
she
mentions
in
this
connection
only
three
were
written
in
london
and
she
admits
that
the
world
at
large
did
not
share
her
view
of
the
sterilizing
effect
of
beaconsfield
for
she
writes
meanwhile
his
fame
grew
wider
his
sales
greater
in
exile
he
ruled
a
literary
world
p
gilbert
left
to
cecil
chesterton
sums
equal
to
those
later
left
to
her
by
frances
for
herself
and
for
cecil
houses
the
ingratitude
that
omitted
all
mention
of
these
benefactions
struck
the
imagination
of
several
of
the
chesterton
family
as
the
worst
feature
in
the
book
but
to
gilbert
and
frances
the
giving
of
money
even
in
their
own
lifetime
was
a
slight
matter
they
had
given
something
far
greater
why
is
the
memory
of
cecil
chesterton
alive
today
because
of
his
brother
labors
why
is
it
possible
for
cecil
to
declare
that
he
was
the
greater
editor
to
imply
that
he
was
the
greater
man
because
gilbert
kept
saying
so
never
has
such
devotion
been
shown
by
one
brother
to
the
memory
of
another
never
has
the
greater
man
exalted
the
lesser
to
such
a
pedestal
we
are
told
in
that
frances
sacrificed
both
gilbert
and
herself
on
the
altar
of
her
family
truly
there
was
much
in
the
lives
of
both
to
family
friends
and
causes
they
did
not
feel
it
as
to
enrich
the
lives
of
others
even
at
cost
to
themselves
but
the
heaviest
cost
they
paid
lay
in
the
years
of
a
toil
that
was
literally
killing
gilbert
while
frances
watched
him
growing
old
too
soon
and
straining
his
heart
with
work
crushingly
heavy
and
if
there
was
a
single
altar
for
that
supreme
sacrifice
it
was
no
other
than
the
altar
of
cecil
memory
