the

first
published
the
craft
of
fiction
i
to
grasp
the
shadowy
and
fantasmal
form
of
a
book
to
hold
it
fast
to
turn
it
over
and
survey
it
at
leisure
that
is
the
effort
of
a
critic
of
books
and
it
is
perpetually
defeated
nothing
no
power
will
keep
a
book
steady
and
motionless
before
us
so
that
we
may
have
time
to
examine
its
shape
and
design
as
quickly
as
we
read
it
melts
and
shifts
in
the
memory
even
at
the
moment
when
the
last
page
is
turned
a
great
part
of
the
book
its
finer
detail
is
already
vague
and
doubtful
a
little
later
after
a
few
days
or
months
how
much
is
really
left
of
it
a
cluster
of
impressions
some
clear
points
emerging
from
a
mist
of
uncertainty
this
is
all
we
can
hope
to
possess
generally
speaking
in
the
name
of
a
book
the
experience
of
reading
it
has
left
something
behind
and
these
relics
we
call
by
the
book
name
but
how
can
they
be
considered
to
give
us
the
material
for
judging
and
appraising
the
book
nobody
would
venture
to
criticize
a
building
a
statue
a
picture
with
nothing
before
him
but
the
memory
of
a
single
glimpse
caught
in
passing
yet
the
critic
of
literature
on
the
whole
has
to
found
his
opinion
upon
little
more
sometimes
it
is
possible
to
return
to
the
book
and
renew
the
impression
to
a
few
books
we
may
come
back
again
and
again
till
they
do
in
the
end
become
familiar
sights
but
of
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
books
that
a
critic
would
wish
to
range
in
his
memory
in
order
to
scrutinize
and
compare
them
reflectively
how
many
can
he
expect
to
bring
into
a
state
of
reasonable
stability
few
indeed
at
the
best
as
for
the
others
he
must
be
content
with
the
shapeless
incoherent
visions
that
respond
when
the
recollection
of
them
is
invoked
it
is
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
if
criticism
is
not
very
precise
not
very
exact
in
the
use
of
its
terms
when
it
has
to
work
at
such
a
disadvantage
since
we
can
never
speak
of
a
book
with
our
eye
on
the
object
never
handle
a
book
the
real
book
which
is
to
the
volume
as
the
symphony
to
the
score
our
phrases
find
nothing
to
check
them
immediately
and
unmistakably
while
they
are
formed
of
a
novel
for
instance
that
i
seem
to
know
well
that
i
recall
as
an
old
acquaintance
i
may
confidently
begin
to
express
an
opinion
but
when
having
expressed
it
i
would
glance
at
the
book
once
more
to
be
satisfied
that
my
judgement
fits
it
i
can
only
turn
to
the
image
such
as
it
is
that
remains
in
a
deceiving
memory
the
volume
lies
before
me
no
doubt
and
if
it
is
merely
a
question
of
detail
a
name
or
a
scene
i
can
find
the
page
and
verify
my
sentence
but
i
can
not
catch
a
momentary
sight
of
the
book
the
book
itself
i
can
not
look
up
from
my
writing
and
sharpen
my
impression
with
a
straight
unhampered
view
of
the
author
work
to
glance
at
a
book
though
the
phrase
is
so
often
in
our
mouths
is
in
fact
an
impossibility
the
form
of
a
novel
and
how
often
a
critic
uses
that
expression
too
is
something
that
none
of
us
perhaps
has
ever
really
contemplated
it
is
revealed
little
by
little
page
by
page
and
it
is
withdrawn
as
fast
as
it
is
revealed
as
a
whole
complete
and
perfect
it
could
only
exist
in
a
more
tenacious
memory
than
most
of
us
have
to
rely
on
our
critical
faculty
may
be
admirable
we
may
be
thoroughly
capable
of
judging
a
book
justly
if
only
we
could
watch
it
at
ease
but
fine
taste
and
keen
perception
are
of
no
use
to
us
if
we
can
not
retain
the
image
of
the
book
and
the
image
escapes
and
evades
us
like
a
cloud
we
are
so
well
accustomed
to
this
disability
that
i
may
seem
to
make
too
much
of
it
in
theory
certainly
the
book
is
never
present
in
the
critic
mind
never
there
in
all
its
completeness
but
enough
of
it
in
a
commonly
good
memory
remains
to
be
discussed
and
criticized
the
book
as
we
remember
it
the
book
that
survives
is
sufficient
for
practical
purposes
such
we
assume
to
be
the
case
and
our
criticism
is
very
little
troubled
by
the
thought
that
it
is
only
directed
at
certain
fragments
of
the
book
which
the
author
wrote
the
rest
of
it
having
ceased
to
exist
for
us
there
is
plenty
to
say
of
a
book
even
in
this
condition
for
the
hours
of
our
actual
exposure
to
it
were
full
and
eventful
and
after
living
for
a
time
with
people
like
clarissa
harlowe
or
anna
karenina
or
emma
bovary
we
have
had
a
lasting
experience
though
the
novels
in
which
they
figured
may
fall
away
into
dimness
and
uncertainty
these
women
with
some
of
the
scenes
and
episodes
of
their
history
remain
with
us
as
vividly
as
though
we
had
known
them
in
life
and
we
still
keep
a
general
impression
of
their
setting
and
their
fortunes
a
background
more
or
less
undefined
but
associated
with
the
thought
of
them
it
all
makes
a
very
real
and
solid
possession
of
a
kind
and
we
readily
accept
it
as
the
book
itself
one
does
not
need
to
remember
the
smaller
detail
of
the
story
to
perceive
the
truth
and
force
of
the
characters
and
if
a
great
deal
is
forgotten
the
most
striking
aspects
of
the
case
will
linger
in
the
mind
as
we
look
back
dramatic
episodes
fine
pieces
of
description
above
all
the
presence
of
many
interesting
and
remarkable
people
while
there
is
so
much
that
instantly
springs
to
light
when
the
book
is
mentioned
it
seems
perverse
to
say
that
the
book
is
not
before
us
as
we
write
of
it
the
real
heart
and
substance
of
the
book
it
might
even
be
urged
stands
out
the
more
clearly
for
the
obscurity
into
which
the
less
essential
parts
of
it
subside
and
true
it
is
that
for
criticism
of
the
author
genius
of
the
power
and
quality
of
his
imagination
the
impressions
we
are
able
to
save
from
oblivion
are
material
in
plenty
of
richardson
and
tolstoy
and
flaubert
we
can
say
at
once
that
their
command
of
life
their
grasp
of
character
their
knowledge
of
human
affections
and
manners
had
a
certain
range
and
strength
and
depth
we
can
penetrate
their
minds
and
detect
the
ideas
that
ruled
there
to
have
lived
with
their
creations
is
to
have
lived
with
them
as
well
with
so
many
hours
of
familiar
intercourse
behind
us
we
have
learnt
to
know
them
and
it
matters
little
that
at
any
particular
moment
our
vision
of
their
work
is
bound
to
be
imperfect
the
forgotten
detail
has
all
contributed
to
our
sense
of
the
genius
which
built
up
and
elaborated
the
structure
and
that
sense
abides
clarissa
and
anna
and
emma
are
positive
facts
and
so
are
their
authors
the
criticism
of
fiction
is
securely
founded
upon
its
object
if
by
fiction
we
mean
something
more
something
other
than
the
novel
itself
if
we
mean
its
effects
and
the
imaginative
gifts
which
they
imply
in
the
novelist
these
we
can
examine
as
long
and
as
closely
as
we
choose
for
they
persist
and
grow
more
definite
as
we
cultivate
the
remembrance
of
them
and
to
these
accordingly
we
find
our
criticism
always
tending
we
discuss
the
writer
we
discuss
the
people
in
his
book
we
discuss
the
kind
of
life
he
renders
and
his
success
in
the
rendering
but
meanwhile
the
book
the
thing
he
made
lies
imprisoned
in
the
volume
and
our
glimpse
of
it
was
too
fleeting
it
seems
to
leave
us
with
a
lasting
knowledge
of
its
form
we
soon
reach
the
end
of
so
much
as
we
have
to
say
on
that
subject
perhaps
we
should
have
more
to
say
of
it
if
we
read
the
book
differently
in
the
first
place
i
scarcely
think
we
could
any
of
us
claim
that
in
reading
a
novel
we
deliberately
watch
the
book
itself
rather
than
the
scenes
and
figures
it
suggests
or
that
we
seek
to
construct
an
image
of
the
book
page
by
page
while
its
form
is
gradually
exposed
to
us
we
are
much
more
inclined
to
forget
if
we
can
that
the
book
is
an
object
of
art
and
to
treat
it
as
a
piece
of
the
life
around
us
we
fashion
for
ourselves
we
objectify
the
elements
in
it
that
happen
to
strike
us
most
keenly
such
as
an
effective
scene
or
a
brilliant
character
these
things
take
shape
in
the
mind
of
the
reader
they
are
recreated
and
set
up
where
the
eye
can
rest
on
them
they
become
works
of
art
no
doubt
in
their
way
but
they
are
not
the
book
which
the
author
offers
us
that
is
a
larger
and
more
complex
form
one
that
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
think
of
as
a
rounded
thing
a
novel
as
we
say
opens
a
new
world
to
the
imagination
and
it
is
pleasant
to
discover
that
sometimes
in
a
few
novels
it
is
a
world
which
creates
an
illusion
so
pleasant
that
we
are
content
to
be
lost
in
it
when
that
happens
there
is
no
chance
of
our
finding
perceiving
recreating
the
form
of
the
book
so
far
from
losing
ourselves
in
the
world
of
the
novel
we
must
hold
it
away
from
us
see
it
all
in
detachment
and
use
the
whole
of
it
to
make
the
image
we
seek
the
book
itself
it
is
difficult
to
treat
a
large
and
stirring
piece
of
fiction
in
this
way
the
landscape
opens
out
and
surrounds
us
and
we
proceed
to
create
what
is
in
effect
a
novel
within
the
novel
which
the
author
wrote
when
for
example
i
try
to
consider
closely
the
remnant
that
exists
in
my
memory
of
a
book
read
and
admired
years
ago
of
such
a
book
as
clarissa
harlowe
i
well
understand
that
in
reading
it
i
was
unconsciously
making
a
selection
of
my
own
choosing
a
little
of
the
story
here
and
there
to
form
a
durable
image
and
that
my
selection
only
included
such
things
as
i
could
easily
work
into
shape
the
girl
herself
first
of
all
if
she
though
so
much
of
her
story
has
faded
away
is
still
visibly
present
it
is
because
nothing
is
simpler
than
to
create
for
oneself
the
idea
of
a
human
being
a
figure
and
a
character
from
a
series
of
glimpses
and
anecdotes
creation
of
this
kind
we
practise
every
day
we
are
continually
piecing
together
our
fragmentary
evidence
about
the
people
around
us
and
moulding
their
images
in
thought
it
is
the
way
in
which
we
make
our
world
partially
imperfectly
very
much
at
haphazard
but
still
perpetually
everybody
deals
with
his
experience
like
an
artist
and
his
talent
such
as
it
may
be
for
rounding
and
detaching
his
experience
of
a
man
or
a
woman
so
that
the
thing
stands
clear
in
his
thought
and
takes
the
light
on
every
side
this
can
never
lie
idle
it
is
exercised
every
hour
of
the
day
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
hear
of
clarissa
therefore
on
the
first
page
of
richardson
book
the
shaping
objectifying
mind
of
the
reader
is
at
work
on
familiar
material
it
is
so
easy
to
construct
the
idea
of
the
exquisite
creature
that
she
seems
to
step
from
the
pages
of
her
own
accord
i
as
i
read
am
aware
of
nothing
but
that
a
new
acquaintance
is
gradually
becoming
better
and
better
known
to
me
no
conscious
effort
is
needed
to
make
a
recognizable
woman
of
her
though
in
fact
i
am
fitting
a
multitude
of
small
details
together
as
i
proceed
to
give
her
the
body
and
mind
that
she
presently
possesses
and
so
too
with
the
lesser
people
in
the
book
and
with
their
surroundings
so
too
with
the
incidents
that
pass
a
succession
of
moments
are
visualized
are
wrought
into
form
by
the
reader
though
perhaps
very
few
of
them
are
so
well
made
that
they
will
last
in
memory
if
they
soon
disappear
the
fault
may
be
the
writer
or
the
reader
richardson
if
he
failed
to
describe
them
adequately
mine
if
my
manner
of
reading
has
not
been
sufficiently
creative
in
any
case
the
page
that
has
been
well
read
has
the
best
chance
of
survival
it
was
soundly
fashioned
to
start
with
out
of
the
material
given
me
by
the
writer
and
at
least
it
will
resist
the
treachery
of
a
poor
memory
more
resolutely
than
a
page
that
i
did
not
thoroughly
recreate
but
still
as
i
say
the
aspects
of
a
book
that
for
the
most
part
we
detach
and
solidify
are
simply
those
which
cost
us
no
deliberate
pains
we
bring
to
the
reading
of
a
book
certain
imaginative
faculties
which
are
in
use
all
the
day
long
faculties
that
enable
us
to
complete
in
our
minds
the
people
and
the
scenes
which
the
novelist
describes
to
give
them
dimensions
to
see
round
them
to
make
them
real
and
these
faculties
no
doubt
when
they
are
combined
with
a
trained
taste
a
sense
of
quality
seem
to
represent
all
that
is
needed
for
the
criticism
of
fiction
the
novel
and
in
these
pages
i
speak
only
of
the
modern
novel
the
picture
of
life
that
we
are
in
a
position
to
understand
without
the
knowledge
of
a
student
or
a
scholar
the
modern
novel
asks
for
no
other
equipment
in
its
readers
than
this
common
gift
used
as
instinctively
as
the
power
of
breathing
by
which
we
turn
the
flat
impressions
of
our
senses
into
solid
shapes
this
gift
and
nothing
else
except
that
other
certainly
much
less
common
by
which
we
discriminate
between
the
thing
that
is
good
of
its
kind
and
the
thing
that
is
bad
such
i
should
think
is
very
nearly
the
theory
of
our
criticism
in
the
matter
of
the
art
of
fiction
a
novel
is
a
picture
of
life
and
life
is
well
known
to
us
let
us
first
of
all
realize
it
and
then
using
our
taste
let
us
judge
whether
it
is
true
vivid
convincing
like
life
in
fact
the
theory
does
indeed
go
a
little
further
we
know
a
novel
is
a
picture
a
portrait
and
we
do
not
forget
that
there
is
more
in
a
portrait
than
the
likeness
form
design
composition
are
to
be
sought
in
a
novel
as
in
any
other
work
of
art
a
novel
is
the
better
for
possessing
them
that
we
must
own
if
fiction
is
an
art
at
all
and
an
art
it
must
be
since
a
literal
transcript
of
life
is
plainly
impossible
the
laws
of
art
therefore
apply
to
this
object
of
our
scrutiny
this
novel
and
it
is
the
better
other
things
being
equal
for
obeying
them
and
yet
is
it
so
very
much
the
better
is
it
not
somehow
true
that
fiction
among
the
arts
is
a
peculiar
case
unusually
exempt
from
the
rules
that
bind
the
rest
does
the
fact
that
a
novel
is
well
designed
well
proportioned
really
make
a
very
great
difference
in
its
power
to
please
and
let
us
answer
honestly
for
if
it
does
not
then
it
is
pedantry
to
force
these
rules
upon
a
novel
in
other
arts
it
may
be
otherwise
and
no
doubt
a
statue
or
an
painting
is
a
plain
offence
to
the
eye
however
skilfully
it
may
copy
life
the
same
thing
is
true
of
a
novel
perhaps
if
the
fault
is
very
bad
very
marked
yet
it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
even
so
it
is
necessarily
fatal
or
that
a
novel
can
not
triumphantly
live
down
the
worst
aberrations
of
this
kind
we
know
of
novels
which
everybody
admits
to
be
badly
constructed
but
which
are
so
full
of
life
that
it
does
not
appear
to
matter
may
we
not
conclude
that
form
design
composition
have
a
rather
different
bearing
upon
the
art
of
fiction
than
any
they
may
have
elsewhere
and
moreover
these
expressions
applied
to
the
viewless
art
of
literature
must
fit
it
loosely
and
insecurely
at
best
does
it
not
seem
so
they
are
words
usurped
from
other
arts
words
that
suppose
a
visible
and
measurable
object
painted
or
carved
for
criticizing
the
craft
of
fiction
we
have
no
other
language
than
that
which
has
been
devised
for
the
material
arts
and
though
we
may
feel
that
to
talk
of
the
colours
and
values
and
perspective
of
a
novel
is
natural
and
legitimate
yet
these
are
only
metaphors
after
all
that
can
not
be
closely
pressed
a
book
starts
a
train
of
ideas
in
the
head
of
the
reader
ideas
which
are
massed
and
arranged
on
some
kind
of
system
but
it
is
only
by
the
help
of
fanciful
analogies
that
we
can
treat
the
mass
as
a
definite
object
such
phrases
may
give
hints
and
suggestions
concerning
the
method
of
the
novelist
the
whole
affair
is
too
nebulous
for
more
even
if
a
critic
memory
were
infallible
as
it
can
never
be
still
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
give
a
really
scientific
account
of
the
structure
of
the
simplest
book
since
in
the
last
resort
he
can
not
lay
his
finger
upon
a
single
one
of
the
effects
to
which
he
refers
when
two
men
stand
looking
at
a
picture
at
least
their
two
lines
of
vision
meet
at
a
point
upon
the
canvas
they
may
dispute
about
it
but
the
picture
stands
still
and
even
then
they
find
that
criticism
has
its
difficulties
it
would
appear
the
literary
critic
with
nothing
to
point
to
but
the
mere
volume
in
his
hand
must
recognize
that
his
wish
to
be
precise
to
be
definite
to
be
clear
and
exact
in
his
statements
is
hopelessly
vain
it
is
all
undeniable
no
doubt
from
every
side
we
make
out
that
the
criticism
of
a
book
not
the
people
in
the
book
not
the
character
of
the
author
but
the
book
is
impossible
we
can
not
remember
the
book
and
even
if
we
could
we
should
still
be
unable
to
describe
it
in
literal
and
unequivocal
terms
it
can
not
be
done
and
the
only
thing
to
be
said
is
that
perhaps
it
can
be
approached
perhaps
the
book
can
be
seen
a
little
more
closely
in
one
way
than
in
another
it
is
a
modest
claim
and
my
own
attempt
to
assert
it
will
be
still
more
modest
a
few
familiar
novels
possibly
a
dozen
by
still
fewer
writers
it
will
be
enough
if
i
can
view
this
small
handful
with
some
particularity
and
i
shall
consider
them
too
with
no
idea
of
criticizing
all
their
aspects
or
even
more
than
one
how
they
are
made
is
the
only
question
i
shall
ask
and
though
indeed
that
is
a
question
which
incidentally
raises
a
good
many
others
questions
of
the
intention
of
the
novelist
his
choice
of
a
subject
the
manner
of
his
imagination
and
so
forth
these
i
shall
follow
no
further
than
i
can
help
and
as
for
the
few
novels
that
i
shall
speak
of
they
will
be
such
as
appear
to
illustrate
most
plainly
the
various
elements
of
the
craft
one
need
not
range
widely
to
find
them
nor
does
it
matter
if
the
selection
from
any
other
point
of
view
should
seem
arbitrary
many
great
names
may
be
passed
over
for
it
is
not
always
the
greatest
whose
method
of
work
gives
the
convenient
example
on
the
other
hand
the
best
example
is
always
to
be
found
among
the
great
and
it
is
essential
to
keep
to
their
company
but
something
may
first
be
said
of
the
reading
of
a
novel
the
beginning
of
criticism
is
to
read
aright
in
other
words
to
get
into
touch
with
the
book
as
nearly
as
may
be
it
is
a
forlorn
enterprise
that
is
admitted
but
there
are
degrees
of
unsuccess
ii
a
book
has
a
certain
form
we
all
agree
what
the
form
of
a
particular
book
may
be
whether
good
or
bad
and
whether
it
matters
these
are
points
of
debate
but
that
a
book
a
form
this
is
not
disputed
we
hear
the
phrase
on
all
sides
an
unending
argument
is
waged
over
it
one
critic
condemns
a
novel
as
shapeless
meaning
that
its
shape
is
objectionable
another
retorts
that
if
the
novel
has
other
fine
qualities
its
shape
is
unimportant
and
the
two
will
continue
their
controversy
till
an
onlooker
pardonably
bewildered
may
begin
to
suppose
that
form
in
fiction
is
something
to
be
put
in
or
left
out
of
a
novel
according
to
the
taste
of
the
author
but
though
the
discussion
is
indeed
confusingly
worded
at
times
it
is
clear
that
there
is
agreement
on
this
article
at
least
that
a
book
is
a
thing
to
which
a
shape
is
ascribable
good
or
bad
i
have
spoken
of
the
difficulty
that
prevents
us
from
ever
seeing
or
describing
the
shape
with
perfect
certainty
but
evidently
we
are
convinced
that
it
is
there
clothing
the
book
not
as
a
single
form
however
but
as
a
moving
stream
of
impressions
paid
out
of
the
volume
in
a
slender
thread
as
we
turn
the
pages
that
is
how
the
book
reaches
us
or
in
another
image
it
is
a
procession
that
passes
before
us
as
we
sit
to
watch
it
is
hard
to
think
of
this
lapse
and
flow
this
sequence
of
figures
and
scenes
which
must
be
taken
in
a
settled
order
one
after
another
as
existing
in
the
condition
of
an
immobile
form
like
a
pile
of
sculpture
though
we
readily
talk
of
the
book
as
a
material
work
of
art
our
words
seem
to
be
crossed
by
a
sense
that
it
is
rather
a
process
a
passage
of
experience
than
a
thing
of
size
and
shape
i
find
this
contradiction
dividing
all
my
thought
about
books
they
are
objects
yes
completed
and
detached
but
i
recall
them
also
as
tracts
of
time
during
which
clarissa
and
anna
moved
and
lived
and
endured
in
my
view
criticism
is
hampered
by
the
ambiguity
the
two
books
the
two
aspects
of
the
same
book
blur
each
other
a
critic
seems
to
shift
from
this
one
to
that
from
the
thing
carved
in
the
stuff
of
thought
to
the
passing
movement
of
life
and
on
the
whole
it
is
the
latter
aspect
of
the
two
which
asserts
itself
the
first
the
novel
with
its
formal
outline
appears
for
a
moment
and
then
the
life
contained
in
it
breaks
out
and
obscures
it
but
the
procession
which
passes
across
our
line
of
sight
in
the
reading
must
be
marshalled
and
concentrated
somewhere
we
receive
the
story
of
anna
bit
by
bit
all
the
numerous
fragments
that
together
make
tolstoy
book
and
finally
the
tale
is
complete
and
the
book
stands
before
us
or
should
stand
as
a
welded
mass
we
have
been
given
the
material
and
the
book
should
now
be
there
our
treacherous
memory
will
have
failed
to
preserve
it
all
but
that
disability
we
have
admitted
and
discounted
at
any
rate
an
imposing
object
ought
to
remain
tolstoy
great
imaginative
sculpture
sufficiently
representing
his
intention
and
again
and
again
at
this
point
i
make
the
same
discovery
i
have
been
watching
the
story
that
is
to
say
forgetful
of
the
fact
that
there
was
more
for
me
to
do
than
to
watch
receptively
and
passively
forgetful
of
the
novel
that
i
should
have
been
fashioning
out
of
the
march
of
experience
as
it
passed
i
have
been
treating
it
as
life
and
that
is
all
very
well
and
is
the
right
manner
as
far
as
it
goes
but
my
treatment
of
life
is
capricious
and
eclectic
and
this
life
this
story
of
anna
has
suffered
accordingly
i
have
taken
much
out
of
it
and
carried
away
many
recollections
i
have
omitted
to
think
of
it
as
matter
to
be
wrought
into
a
single
form
what
wonder
if
i
search
my
mind
in
vain
a
little
later
for
the
book
that
tolstoy
wrote
but
how
is
one
to
construct
a
novel
out
of
the
impressions
that
tolstoy
pours
forth
from
his
prodigious
hands
this
is
a
kind
of
creative
reading
the
phrase
is
emerson
which
comes
instinctively
to
few
of
us
we
know
how
to
imagine
a
landscape
or
a
conversation
when
he
describes
it
but
to
gather
up
all
these
sights
and
sounds
into
a
compact
fabric
round
which
the
mind
can
wander
freely
as
freely
as
it
strays
and
contemplates
and
loses
its
way
perhaps
in
tolstoy
wonderful
world
this
is
a
task
which
does
not
achieve
itself
without
design
and
deliberation
on
the
part
of
the
reader
it
is
an
effort
first
of
all
to
keep
the
world
of
anna
i
cling
to
this
illustration
at
a
distance
and
yet
it
must
be
kept
at
a
distance
if
it
is
to
be
impressed
with
the
form
of
art
no
artist
and
the
skilful
reader
is
an
artist
can
afford
to
be
swayed
and
beset
by
his
material
he
must
stand
above
it
and
then
it
is
a
further
effort
prolonged
needing
practice
and
knowledge
to
recreate
the
novel
in
its
right
form
the
best
form
that
the
material
selected
and
disposed
by
the
author
is
capable
of
accepting
the
reader
of
a
novel
by
which
i
mean
the
critical
reader
is
himself
a
novelist
he
is
the
maker
of
a
book
which
may
or
may
not
please
his
taste
when
it
is
finished
but
of
a
book
for
which
he
must
take
his
own
share
of
the
responsibility
the
author
does
his
part
but
he
can
not
transfer
his
book
like
a
bubble
into
the
brain
of
the
critic
he
can
not
make
sure
that
the
critic
will
possess
his
work
the
reader
must
therefore
become
for
his
part
a
novelist
never
permitting
himself
to
suppose
that
the
creation
of
the
book
is
solely
the
affair
of
the
author
the
difference
between
them
is
immense
of
course
and
so
much
so
that
a
critic
is
always
inclined
to
extend
and
intensify
it
the
opposition
that
he
conceives
between
the
creative
and
the
critical
task
is
a
very
real
one
but
in
modestly
belittling
his
own
side
of
the
business
he
is
apt
to
forget
an
essential
portion
of
it
the
writer
of
the
novel
works
in
a
manner
that
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
the
critic
no
doubt
and
with
a
liberty
and
with
a
range
that
would
disconcert
him
entirely
but
in
one
quarter
their
work
coincides
both
of
them
make
the
novel
is
it
necessary
to
define
the
difference
that
is
soon
done
if
we
picture
tolstoy
and
his
critic
side
by
side
surveying
the
free
and
formless
expanse
of
the
world
of
life
the
critic
has
nothing
to
say
he
waits
looking
to
tolstoy
for
guidance
and
tolstoy
with
the
help
of
some
secret
of
his
own
which
is
his
genius
does
not
hesitate
for
an
instant
his
hand
is
plunged
into
the
scene
he
lifts
out
of
it
great
fragments
right
and
left
ragged
masses
of
life
torn
from
their
setting
he
selects
and
upon
these
trophies
he
sets
to
work
with
the
full
force
of
his
imagination
he
detects
their
significance
he
disengages
and
throws
aside
whatever
is
accidental
and
meaningless
he
them
in
conditions
that
are
never
known
in
life
conditions
in
which
a
thing
is
free
to
grow
according
to
its
own
law
expressing
itself
unhindered
he
liberates
and
completes
and
then
upon
all
this
new
life
so
like
the
old
and
yet
so
different
like
the
old
as
one
may
say
than
the
old
ever
had
the
chance
of
being
upon
all
this
life
that
is
now
so
much
more
intensely
living
than
before
tolstoy
directs
the
skill
of
his
art
he
distributes
it
in
a
single
embracing
design
he
orders
and
disposes
and
thus
the
critic
receives
his
guidance
and
work
begins
no
selection
no
arrangement
is
required
of
him
the
new
world
that
is
laid
before
him
is
the
world
of
art
life
liberated
from
the
tangle
of
saved
from
arbitrary
distortion
instead
of
a
continuous
endless
scene
in
which
the
eye
is
caught
in
a
thousand
directions
at
once
with
nothing
to
hold
it
to
a
fixed
centre
the
landscape
that
opens
before
the
critic
is
whole
and
single
it
has
passed
through
an
imagination
it
has
shed
its
irrelevancy
and
is
compact
with
its
own
meaning
such
is
the
world
in
the
book
in
tolstoy
book
i
do
not
say
but
it
is
the
world
in
the
book
as
it
may
be
in
the
book
where
imagination
and
execution
are
perfectly
harmonized
and
in
any
case
the
critic
accepts
this
ordered
enhanced
display
as
it
stands
better
or
worse
and
uses
it
all
for
the
creation
of
the
book
there
can
be
no
picking
and
choosing
now
that
was
the
business
of
the
novelist
and
it
has
been
accomplished
according
to
his
light
the
critic
creates
out
of
life
that
is
already
subject
to
art
but
his
work
is
not
the
less
plastic
for
that
the
impressions
that
succeed
one
another
as
the
pages
of
the
book
are
turned
are
to
be
built
into
a
structure
and
the
critic
is
missing
his
opportunity
unless
he
can
proceed
in
a
workmanlike
manner
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
an
artist
who
carves
or
paints
is
so
filled
with
emotion
by
the
meaning
of
his
work
the
story
in
it
that
he
forgets
the
abstract
beauty
of
form
and
colour
and
though
there
is
more
room
for
such
sensibility
in
an
art
which
is
the
shaping
of
thought
and
feeling
in
the
art
of
literature
still
the
man
of
letters
is
a
craftsman
and
the
critic
can
not
be
less
he
must
know
how
to
handle
the
stuff
which
is
continually
forming
in
his
mind
while
he
reads
he
must
be
able
to
recognize
its
fine
variations
and
to
take
them
all
into
account
nobody
can
work
in
material
of
which
the
properties
are
unfamiliar
and
a
reader
who
tries
to
get
possession
of
a
book
with
nothing
but
his
appreciation
of
the
life
and
the
ideas
and
the
story
in
it
is
like
a
man
who
builds
a
wall
without
knowing
the
capacities
of
wood
and
clay
and
stone
many
different
substances
as
distinct
to
the
practised
eye
as
stone
and
wood
go
to
the
making
of
a
novel
and
it
is
necessary
to
see
them
for
what
they
are
so
only
is
it
possible
to
use
them
aright
and
to
find
when
the
volume
is
closed
that
a
complete
coherent
appraisable
book
remains
in
the
mind
and
what
are
these
different
substances
and
how
is
a
mere
reader
to
learn
their
right
use
they
are
the
various
forms
of
narrative
the
forms
in
which
a
story
may
be
told
and
while
they
are
many
they
are
not
indeed
so
very
many
though
their
modifications
and
their
commixtures
are
infinite
they
are
not
recondite
we
know
them
well
and
use
them
freely
but
to
use
them
is
easier
than
to
perceive
their
demands
and
their
qualities
these
we
gradually
discern
by
using
them
consciously
and
questioningly
by
reading
i
mean
and
reading
critically
the
books
in
which
they
appear
let
us
very
carefully
follow
the
methods
of
the
novelists
whose
effects
are
incontestable
noticing
exactly
the
manner
in
which
the
scenes
and
figures
in
their
books
are
presented
the
scenes
and
figures
as
i
have
said
we
shape
we
detach
without
the
smallest
difficulty
and
if
we
pause
over
them
for
long
enough
to
see
by
what
arts
and
devices
on
the
author
part
we
have
been
enabled
to
shape
them
so
strikingly
to
see
precisely
how
this
episode
has
been
given
relief
that
character
made
intelligible
and
vivid
we
at
once
begin
to
stumble
on
many
discoveries
about
the
making
of
a
novel
our
criticism
has
been
oddly
incurious
in
the
matter
considering
what
the
dominion
of
the
novel
has
been
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
refinements
of
the
art
of
fiction
have
been
accepted
without
question
or
at
most
have
been
classified
roughly
and
summarily
as
is
proved
by
the
singular
poverty
of
our
critical
vocabulary
as
soon
as
we
pass
beyond
the
simplest
and
plainest
effects
the
expressions
and
the
phrases
at
our
disposal
bear
no
defined
delimited
meanings
they
have
not
been
rounded
and
hardened
by
passing
constantly
from
one
hand
to
another
what
is
to
be
understood
by
a
dramatic
narrative
a
pictorial
narrative
a
scenic
or
a
generalized
story
we
must
use
such
words
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
examine
the
structure
of
a
novel
and
yet
they
are
words
which
have
no
technical
acceptation
in
regard
to
a
novel
and
one
can
not
be
sure
how
they
will
be
taken
the
want
of
a
received
nomenclature
is
a
real
hindrance
and
i
have
often
wished
that
the
modern
novel
had
been
invented
a
hundred
years
sooner
so
that
it
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
critical
schoolmen
of
the
seventeenth
century
as
the
production
of
an
age
of
romance
or
of
the
eve
of
such
an
age
it
missed
the
advantage
of
the
dry
light
of
academic
judgement
and
i
think
it
still
has
reason
to
regret
the
loss
the
critic
has
at
any
rate
his
language
even
now
is
unsettled
and
unformed
and
we
still
suffer
from
a
kind
of
shyness
in
the
presence
of
a
novel
from
shyness
of
the
author
or
of
his
sentiments
or
of
his
imagined
world
no
indeed
but
we
are
haunted
by
a
sense
that
a
novel
is
a
piece
of
life
and
that
to
take
it
to
pieces
would
be
to
destroy
it
we
begin
to
analyse
it
and
we
seem
to
be
like
beckmesser
writing
down
the
mistakes
of
the
upon
his
slate
it
is
an
obscure
delicacy
not
clearly
formulated
not
admitted
perhaps
in
so
many
words
but
it
has
its
share
in
restraining
the
hand
of
criticism
we
scarcely
need
to
be
thus
considerate
the
immense
and
necessary
difficulty
of
closing
with
a
book
at
all
on
any
terms
might
appear
to
be
enough
without
adding
another
the
book
is
safe
from
rude
violation
and
it
is
not
a
piece
of
life
it
is
a
piece
of
art
like
another
and
the
fact
that
it
is
an
ideal
shape
with
no
existence
in
space
only
to
be
spoken
of
in
figures
and
metaphors
makes
it
all
the
more
important
that
in
our
thought
it
should
be
protected
by
no
romantic
scruple
or
perhaps
it
is
not
really
the
book
that
we
are
shy
of
but
a
still
more
fugitive
phantom
our
pleasure
in
it
it
spoils
the
fun
of
a
novel
to
know
how
it
is
made
is
this
a
reflection
that
lurks
at
the
back
of
our
minds
sometimes
i
think
but
the
pleasure
of
illusion
is
small
beside
the
pleasure
of
creation
and
the
greater
is
open
to
every
reader
volume
in
hand
how
a
novelist
finds
his
subject
in
a
human
being
or
in
a
situation
or
in
a
turn
of
thought
this
indeed
is
beyond
us
we
might
look
long
at
the
very
world
that
tolstoy
saw
we
should
never
detect
the
unwritten
book
he
found
there
and
he
can
seldom
he
and
the
rest
of
them
give
any
account
of
the
process
of
discovery
the
power
that
recognizes
the
fruitful
idea
and
seizes
it
is
a
thing
apart
for
this
reason
we
judge
the
novelist
eye
for
a
subject
to
be
his
cardinal
gift
and
we
have
nothing
to
say
whether
by
way
of
exhortation
or
of
warning
till
his
subject
is
announced
but
from
that
moment
he
is
accessible
his
privilege
is
shared
and
the
delight
of
treating
the
subject
is
acute
and
perennial
from
point
to
point
we
follow
the
writer
always
looking
back
to
the
subject
itself
in
order
to
understand
the
logic
of
the
course
he
pursues
we
find
that
we
are
creating
a
design
large
or
small
simple
or
intricate
as
the
chapter
finished
is
fitted
into
its
place
or
again
there
is
a
flaw
and
a
break
in
the
development
the
author
takes
a
turn
that
appears
to
contradict
or
to
disregard
the
subject
and
the
critical
question
strictly
so
called
begins
is
this
proceeding
of
the
author
the
right
one
the
best
for
the
subject
is
it
possible
to
conceive
and
to
name
a
better
the
hours
of
the
author
labour
are
lived
again
by
the
reader
the
pleasure
of
creation
is
renewed
so
it
goes
till
the
book
is
ended
and
we
look
back
at
the
whole
design
it
may
be
absolutely
satisfying
to
the
eye
the
expression
of
the
subject
complete
and
compact
but
with
the
book
in
this
condition
of
a
defined
shape
firm
of
outline
its
form
shows
for
what
it
is
indeed
not
an
attribute
one
of
many
and
possibly
not
the
most
important
but
the
book
itself
as
the
form
of
a
statue
is
the
statue
itself
if
the
form
is
to
the
eye
imperfect
it
means
that
the
subject
is
somehow
and
somewhere
imperfectly
expressed
it
means
that
the
story
has
suffered
where
then
and
how
is
it
because
the
treatment
has
not
started
from
the
heart
of
the
subject
or
has
diverged
from
the
line
of
its
true
development
or
is
it
that
the
subject
itself
was
poor
and
unfruitful
the
question
ramifies
quickly
but
anyhow
here
is
the
book
or
something
that
we
need
not
hesitate
to
regard
as
the
book
recreated
according
to
the
best
of
the
reader
ability
indeed
he
knows
well
that
it
will
melt
away
in
time
nothing
can
altogether
save
it
only
it
will
last
for
longer
than
it
would
have
lasted
if
it
had
been
read
uncritically
if
it
had
not
been
deliberately
recreated
in
that
case
it
would
have
fallen
to
pieces
at
once
anna
and
clarissa
would
have
stepped
out
of
the
work
of
art
in
which
their
authors
had
so
laboriously
enshrined
them
the
book
would
have
perished
it
is
now
a
single
form
and
let
us
judge
the
effect
of
it
while
we
may
at
best
we
shall
have
no
more
time
than
we
certainly
require
iii
a
great
and
brilliant
novel
a
novel
and
at
the
same
time
a
large
and
crowded
and
unmanageable
novel
such
will
be
the
book
to
consider
first
it
must
be
one
that
is
universally
admitted
to
be
a
work
of
genius
signal
and
conspicuous
i
wish
to
examine
its
form
i
do
not
wish
to
argue
its
merit
it
must
be
a
book
which
it
is
superfluous
to
praise
but
which
it
will
never
seem
too
late
to
praise
again
it
must
also
be
well
known
and
this
narrows
the
category
the
novel
of
whose
surpassing
value
every
one
is
convinced
may
easily
fall
outside
it
our
novel
must
be
one
that
is
not
only
commended
but
habitually
read
and
since
we
are
concerned
with
the
difficulty
of
controlling
the
form
of
a
novel
let
it
be
an
evident
case
of
the
difficulty
an
extreme
case
on
a
large
scale
where
the
question
can
not
be
disguised
a
novel
of
ample
scope
covering
wide
spaces
and
many
years
long
and
populous
and
eventful
the
category
is
reduced
indeed
perhaps
it
contains
one
novel
only
war
and
peace
of
war
and
peace
it
has
never
been
suggested
i
suppose
that
tolstoy
here
produced
a
model
of
perfect
form
it
is
a
panoramic
vision
of
people
and
places
a
huge
expanse
in
which
armies
are
marshalled
can
one
expect
of
such
a
book
that
it
should
be
neatly
composed
it
is
crowded
with
life
at
whatever
point
we
face
it
intensely
vivid
inexhaustibly
stirring
the
broad
impression
is
made
by
the
big
prodigality
of
tolstoy
invention
if
a
novel
could
really
be
as
large
as
life
tolstoy
could
easily
fill
it
his
great
masterful
reach
never
seems
near
its
limit
he
is
always
ready
to
annex
another
and
yet
another
tract
of
life
he
is
only
restrained
by
the
mere
necessity
of
bringing
a
novel
somewhere
to
an
end
and
then
too
this
mighty
command
of
spaces
and
masses
is
only
half
his
power
he
spreads
further
than
any
one
else
but
he
also
touches
the
detail
of
the
scene
the
single
episode
the
fine
shade
of
character
with
exquisite
lightness
and
precision
nobody
surpasses
in
some
ways
nobody
approaches
the
easy
authority
with
which
he
handles
the
matter
immediately
before
him
at
the
moment
a
roomful
of
people
the
brilliance
of
youth
spring
sunshine
in
a
forest
a
boy
on
a
horse
whatever
his
shifting
panorama
brings
into
view
he
makes
of
it
an
image
of
beauty
and
truth
that
is
final
complete
unqualified
before
the
profusion
of
war
and
peace
the
question
of
its
general
form
is
scarcely
raised
it
is
enough
that
such
a
world
should
have
been
pictured
it
is
idle
to
look
for
proportion
and
design
in
a
book
that
contains
a
world
but
for
this
very
reason
that
there
is
so
much
in
the
book
to
distract
attention
from
its
form
it
is
particularly
interesting
to
ask
how
it
is
made
the
doubt
the
obvious
perplexity
is
a
challenge
to
the
exploring
eye
it
may
well
be
that
effective
composition
on
such
a
scale
is
impossible
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
say
exactly
where
tolstoy
fails
if
the
total
effect
of
his
book
is
inconclusive
it
is
all
lucidity
and
shapeliness
in
its
parts
there
is
no
faltering
in
his
hold
upon
character
he
never
loses
his
way
among
the
scores
of
men
and
women
in
the
book
and
in
all
the
endless
series
of
scenes
and
events
there
is
not
one
which
betrays
a
hesitating
intention
the
story
rolls
on
and
on
and
it
is
long
before
the
reader
can
begin
to
question
its
direction
tolstoy
to
know
precisely
where
he
is
going
and
why
there
is
nothing
at
any
moment
to
suggest
that
he
is
not
in
perfect
and
serene
control
of
his
idea
only
at
last
perhaps
we
turn
back
and
wonder
what
it
was
what
is
the
subject
of
war
and
peace
what
is
the
novel
there
is
no
very
ready
answer
but
if
we
are
to
discover
what
is
wrong
with
the
form
this
is
the
question
to
press
what
is
the
story
there
is
first
of
all
a
succession
of
phases
in
the
lives
of
certain
generations
youth
that
passes
out
into
maturity
fortunes
that
meet
and
clash
and
hopes
that
flourish
and
wane
and
reappear
in
other
lives
age
that
sinks
and
hands
on
the
torch
to
youth
again
such
is
the
substance
of
the
drama
the
book
i
take
it
begins
to
grow
out
of
the
thought
of
the
processional
march
of
the
generations
always
changing
always
renewed
its
figures
are
sought
and
chosen
for
the
clarity
with
which
the
drama
is
embodied
in
them
young
people
of
different
looks
and
talents
moods
and
tempers
but
young
with
the
youth
of
all
times
and
places
the
story
is
alive
with
them
at
once
the
rostov
household
resounds
with
them
the
rostovs
are
of
the
easy
sort
then
there
is
the
dreary
old
bolkonsky
mansion
with
andrew
generous
and
sceptical
and
with
poor
plain
marya
ardent
and
repressed
and
for
quite
another
kind
of
youth
there
is
peter
besukhov
master
of
millions
fat
and
and
indolent
his
brain
a
fever
of
faiths
and
aspirations
which
not
he
but
andrew
so
much
more
sparing
in
high
hopes
has
the
tenacity
to
follow
these
are
in
the
foreground
and
between
and
behind
them
are
more
and
more
young
men
and
women
at
every
turn
crowding
forward
to
take
their
places
as
the
new
generation
it
does
not
matter
it
does
not
affect
the
drama
that
they
are
men
and
women
of
a
certain
race
and
century
soldiers
politicians
princes
russians
in
an
age
of
crisis
such
they
are
with
all
the
circumstances
of
their
time
and
place
about
them
but
such
they
are
in
secondary
fashion
it
is
what
they
happen
to
be
essentially
they
are
not
princes
not
russians
but
figures
in
the
great
procession
they
are
here
in
the
book
because
they
are
young
not
because
they
are
the
rising
hope
of
russia
in
the
years
of
austerlitz
and
borodino
it
is
laid
upon
them
primarily
to
enact
the
cycle
of
birth
and
growth
death
and
birth
again
they
illustrate
the
story
that
is
the
same
always
and
everywhere
and
the
tumult
of
the
dawning
century
to
which
they
are
born
is
an
accident
peter
and
andrew
and
natasha
and
the
rest
of
them
are
the
children
of
yesterday
and
and
there
is
nothing
in
any
of
them
that
is
not
of
all
time
tolstoy
has
no
thought
of
showing
them
as
the
children
of
their
particular
conditions
as
the
generation
that
was
formed
by
a
certain
historic
struggle
he
sees
them
simply
as
the
embodiment
of
youth
to
an
english
reader
of
it
is
curious
and
more
it
is
strangely
moving
to
note
how
faithfully
the
creations
of
tolstoy
the
russian
copy
the
young
people
of
the
twentieth
century
and
of
england
it
is
all
one
life
in
moscow
then
life
in
london
now
provided
only
that
it
is
young
enough
old
age
is
rather
more
ephemeral
its
period
is
written
on
it
not
very
deeply
after
all
and
here
and
there
it
dates
nicholas
and
natasha
are
always
of
the
newest
modernity
such
is
the
that
at
first
sight
appears
to
underlie
the
book
in
spite
of
its
name
such
is
the
most
evident
aspect
of
the
story
as
our
thought
brushes
freely
and
rapidly
around
it
in
this
drama
the
war
and
the
peace
are
episodic
not
of
the
centre
the
historic
scene
is
used
as
a
foil
and
a
background
it
appears
from
time
to
time
for
the
sake
of
its
value
in
throwing
the
nearer
movement
of
life
into
strong
relief
it
very
powerfully
and
strikingly
shows
what
the
young
people
the
drama
of
the
rise
of
a
generation
is
nowhere
more
sharply
visible
and
appreciable
than
it
is
in
such
a
time
of
convulsion
tolstoy
moment
is
well
chosen
his
story
has
a
setting
that
is
fiercely
effective
the
kind
of
setting
which
in
our
europe
this
story
has
indeed
found
very
regularly
century
by
century
but
it
is
not
by
the
war
from
this
point
of
view
that
the
multifarious
scenes
are
linked
together
it
is
by
another
idea
a
more
general
as
we
may
still
dare
to
hope
than
the
idea
of
war
youth
and
age
the
flow
and
the
ebb
of
the
recurrent
tide
this
is
the
theme
of
tolstoy
book
so
it
seems
for
a
while
but
tolstoy
called
his
novel
war
and
peace
and
presently
there
arises
a
doubt
did
he
believe
himself
to
be
writing
story
and
not
the
story
of
youth
and
age
i
have
been
supposing
that
he
named
his
book
carelessly
he
would
not
be
alone
among
great
novelists
for
that
and
thereby
emphasized
the
wrong
side
of
his
intention
but
there
are
things
in
the
drama
which
suggest
that
his
title
really
represented
the
book
he
projected
cutting
across
the
big
human
motive
i
have
indicated
there
falls
a
second
line
of
thought
and
sometimes
it
is
this
most
clearly
that
the
author
is
following
not
the
cycle
of
life
everlasting
in
which
the
rage
of
nations
is
an
incident
a
noise
and
an
incursion
from
without
but
the
strife
itself
the
irrelevant
uproar
becomes
the
motive
of
the
fable
war
and
peace
the
drama
of
that
ancient
alternation
is
now
the
subject
out
of
which
the
form
of
the
book
is
to
grow
not
seldom
and
more
frequently
as
the
book
advances
the
story
takes
this
new
and
contradictory
alignment
the
centre
shifts
from
the
general
play
of
life
neither
national
nor
historic
and
plants
itself
in
the
field
of
racial
conflict
typified
by
that
of
europe
which
followed
the
french
revolution
the
young
people
immediately
change
their
meaning
they
are
no
longer
there
for
their
own
sake
guardians
of
the
torch
for
their
hour
they
are
partially
and
fitfully
in
another
relation
they
are
made
to
figure
as
creatures
of
the
russian
scene
at
the
impact
of
east
and
west
in
the
napoleonic
clash
it
is
a
mighty
antinomy
indeed
on
a
scale
adapted
to
tolstoy
giant
imagination
with
one
hand
he
takes
up
the
largest
subject
in
the
world
the
story
to
which
all
other
human
stories
are
subordinate
and
not
content
with
this
in
the
other
hand
he
produces
the
drama
of
a
great
historic
collision
for
which
a
scene
is
set
with
no
less
prodigious
a
gesture
and
there
is
not
a
sign
in
the
book
to
show
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
apparently
he
was
quite
unconscious
that
he
was
writing
two
novels
at
once
such
an
oversight
is
not
peculiar
to
men
of
genius
i
dare
say
the
least
of
us
is
capable
of
the
feat
many
of
us
are
seen
to
practise
it
but
two
such
novels
as
these
two
such
immemorial
epics
caught
up
together
and
written
out
in
a
couple
of
thousand
pages
inadvertently
mixed
and
entangled
and
all
with
an
air
of
composure
never
ruffled
or
embarrassed
in
a
style
of
luminous
simplicity
it
was
a
feat
that
demanded
that
betokened
the
genius
of
tolstoy
war
and
peace
is
like
an
iliad
the
story
of
certain
men
and
an
aeneid
the
story
of
a
nation
compressed
into
one
book
by
a
man
who
never
so
much
as
noticed
that
he
was
homer
and
virgil
by
turns
or
can
it
perhaps
be
argued
that
he
was
aware
of
the
task
he
set
himself
and
that
he
intentionally
coupled
his
two
themes
he
proposed
let
us
say
to
set
the
unchanging
story
of
life
against
the
momentary
tumult
which
makes
such
a
stir
in
the
but
which
passes
leaving
the
other
story
still
unrolling
for
ever
perhaps
he
did
but
i
am
looking
only
at
his
book
and
i
can
see
no
hint
of
it
in
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
novel
as
it
stands
i
can
discover
no
angle
at
which
the
two
stories
will
appear
to
unite
and
merge
in
a
single
impression
neither
is
subordinate
to
the
other
and
there
is
nothing
above
them
what
more
there
be
to
which
they
are
both
related
nor
are
they
placed
together
to
illustrate
a
contrast
nothing
from
their
juxtaposition
only
from
time
to
time
upon
no
apparent
principle
and
without
a
word
of
warning
one
of
them
is
dropped
and
the
other
resumed
it
would
be
possible
i
think
to
mark
the
exact
places
not
always
even
at
the
end
of
a
chapter
but
casually
in
the
middle
of
a
page
where
the
change
occurs
the
reader
begins
to
look
out
for
them
in
the
second
half
of
the
novel
they
are
liberally
sprinkled
the
long
slow
steady
sweep
of
the
story
the
story
as
i
call
it
setting
through
the
personal
lives
of
a
few
young
people
bringing
them
together
separating
them
dimming
their
freshness
carrying
them
away
from
hopeful
adventure
to
their
appointed
condition
where
their
part
is
only
to
transmit
the
gift
of
youth
to
others
and
to
drop
back
while
the
adventure
is
repeated
this
motive
in
which
the
book
opens
and
closes
and
to
which
it
constantly
returns
is
broken
into
by
the
famous
scenes
of
battle
by
some
of
them
to
be
accurate
not
by
all
with
the
reverberation
of
imperial
destinies
out
of
which
tolstoy
makes
a
saga
of
his
country
tempestuous
past
it
is
magnificent
this
latter
but
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
other
the
universal
story
of
no
time
or
country
the
legend
of
every
age
which
is
told
of
nicholas
and
natasha
but
which
might
have
been
told
as
well
of
the
sons
and
daughters
of
the
king
of
troy
to
nicholas
the
youth
of
all
time
the
strife
of
emperor
and
czar
is
the
occasion
it
may
very
well
be
of
the
climax
of
his
adventure
but
it
is
no
more
than
the
occasion
not
essential
to
it
since
by
some
means
or
other
he
would
have
touched
his
climax
in
any
age
war
and
peace
are
likely
enough
to
shape
his
life
for
him
whether
he
belongs
to
ancient
troy
or
to
modern
europe
but
if
it
is
story
his
and
that
of
his
companions
why
do
we
see
them
suddenly
swept
into
the
background
among
the
figures
that
populate
the
story
of
a
particular
and
memorable
war
for
that
is
what
happens
it
is
now
the
war
with
the
generals
and
the
potentates
in
the
forefront
that
is
the
matter
of
the
story
alexander
and
kutusov
napoleon
and
murat
become
the
chief
actors
and
between
them
the
play
is
acted
out
in
this
story
the
loves
and
ambitions
of
the
young
generation
which
have
hitherto
been
central
are
relegated
to
the
fringe
there
are
wide
tracts
in
which
they
do
not
appear
at
all
again
and
again
tolstoy
forgets
them
entirely
he
has
discovered
a
fresh
idea
for
the
unification
of
this
second
book
a
theory
drummed
into
the
reader
with
merciless
iteration
desolating
many
a
weary
page
the
meaning
of
the
book
and
it
is
extraordinary
how
artistic
sense
deserts
him
in
expounding
it
lies
in
the
relation
between
the
man
of
destiny
and
the
forces
that
he
dreams
he
is
directing
it
is
a
high
theme
but
tolstoy
can
not
leave
it
to
make
its
own
effect
he
whose
power
of
making
a
story
is
unsurpassed
is
capable
of
thrusting
into
his
book
interminable
chapters
of
comment
and
explanation
chapters
in
the
manner
of
a
controversial
pamphlet
lest
the
argument
of
his
drama
should
be
missed
but
the
reader
at
last
takes
an
easy
way
with
these
maddening
interruptions
wherever
the
historians
are
mentioned
he
knows
that
several
pages
can
be
turned
at
once
tolstoy
may
be
left
to
belabour
the
conventional
theories
of
the
napoleonic
legend
and
rejoined
later
on
when
it
has
occurred
to
him
once
more
that
he
is
writing
a
novel
when
he
is
not
pamphleteering
tolstoy
treatment
of
the
second
story
the
national
saga
is
masterly
at
every
point
if
we
could
forget
the
original
promise
of
the
book
as
lightly
as
its
author
does
nothing
could
be
more
impressive
than
his
pictures
of
the
two
masses
europe
and
russia
ponderously
colliding
at
the
apparent
dictation
of
a
few
limited
brains
so
few
so
limited
that
the
irony
of
their
claim
to
be
the
directors
of
fate
is
written
over
all
the
scene
napoleon
at
the
crossing
of
the
niemen
napoleon
before
moscow
the
russian
council
of
war
after
borodino
gravely
watched
by
the
small
child
malasha
overlooked
in
her
corner
kutusov
wherever
he
appears
all
these
are
impressions
belonging
wholly
to
the
same
cycle
they
have
no
effect
in
relation
to
the
story
of
peter
and
nicholas
they
do
not
extend
or
advance
it
but
on
their
own
account
they
are
supreme
there
are
not
enough
of
them
and
they
are
not
properly
grouped
and
composed
to
the
second
book
that
has
forced
its
way
into
the
first
the
cycle
of
the
war
and
the
peace
as
distinguished
from
the
cycle
of
youth
and
age
is
broken
and
fragmentary
the
size
of
the
theme
and
the
scale
upon
which
these
scenes
are
drawn
imply
a
novel
as
long
as
our
existing
war
and
peace
it
would
all
be
filled
by
kutusov
and
napoleon
if
their
drama
were
fully
treated
leaving
no
room
for
another
but
mutilated
as
it
is
each
of
the
fragments
is
broadly
handled
highly
finished
and
perfectly
adjusted
to
a
point
of
view
that
is
not
the
point
of
view
for
the
rest
of
the
book
and
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
the
lines
of
cleavage
which
as
i
suggested
can
be
traced
with
precision
by
no
means
invariably
divide
the
peaceful
scenes
of
romance
from
the
battles
and
intrigues
of
the
historic
struggle
leaving
these
on
one
side
those
on
the
other
sometimes
the
great
public
events
are
used
as
the
earlier
theme
demands
that
they
should
be
used
as
the
material
in
which
the
story
of
youth
is
embodied
consider
for
instance
one
of
the
earlier
in
the
book
where
nicholas
very
youthful
indeed
is
for
the
first
time
under
fire
he
comes
and
goes
bewildered
laments
like
a
lost
child
is
inspired
with
heroism
and
flees
like
a
hare
for
his
life
as
tolstoy
presents
it
this
battle
or
a
large
part
of
it
is
the
affair
of
nicholas
it
belongs
to
him
it
is
a
piece
of
experience
that
enters
his
life
and
enriches
our
sense
of
it
many
of
the
wonderful
chapters
again
which
deal
with
the
abandonment
and
the
conflagration
of
moscow
are
seen
through
the
lives
of
the
irrepressible
rostov
household
or
of
peter
in
his
squalid
imprisonment
the
scene
is
framed
in
their
consciousness
prince
andrew
too
nobody
can
forget
how
much
of
the
battle
in
which
he
is
mortally
wounded
is
transformed
into
an
emotion
of
those
pages
are
filched
from
tolstoy
theory
of
the
war
and
given
to
his
fiction
in
all
these
episodes
and
in
others
of
the
same
kind
the
history
of
the
time
is
in
the
background
in
front
of
it
closely
watched
for
their
own
sake
are
the
lives
which
that
history
so
deeply
affects
but
in
the
other
series
of
pictures
of
the
campaign
mingled
with
these
it
is
different
they
are
admirable
but
they
screen
the
thought
of
the
particular
lives
in
which
the
wider
interest
of
the
book
as
i
take
it
to
be
is
firmly
lodged
from
a
huge
emotion
that
reaches
us
through
the
youth
exposed
to
it
the
war
is
changed
into
an
emotion
of
our
own
it
is
rendered
by
the
on
the
whole
as
a
scene
directly
faced
by
himself
instead
of
being
reflected
in
the
experience
of
the
rising
generation
it
is
true
that
good
instinct
guides
him
ever
and
again
away
from
the
mere
telling
of
the
story
on
his
own
authority
at
high
moments
he
knows
better
than
to
tell
it
himself
he
approaches
it
through
the
mind
of
an
onlooker
napoleon
or
kutusov
or
the
little
girl
by
the
stove
in
the
corner
borrowing
the
value
of
indirectness
the
increased
effect
of
a
story
that
is
seen
as
it
is
mirrored
in
the
mind
of
another
but
he
chooses
his
onlooker
at
random
and
follows
no
consistent
method
the
predominant
point
of
view
is
simply
his
own
that
of
the
independent
so
that
the
general
effect
of
these
pictures
is
made
on
a
totally
different
principle
from
that
which
governs
the
story
of
the
young
people
in
that
story
though
there
too
tolstoy
method
is
far
from
being
consistent
the
effect
is
based
on
our
free
sharing
in
the
hopes
and
fears
and
meditations
of
the
chosen
few
in
the
one
case
tolstoy
is
immediately
beside
us
narrating
in
the
other
it
is
peter
and
andrew
nicholas
and
natasha
who
are
with
us
and
about
us
and
tolstoy
is
effaced
here
then
is
the
reason
or
at
any
rate
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
general
shape
of
war
and
peace
fails
to
satisfy
the
eye
as
i
suppose
it
admittedly
to
fail
it
is
a
confusion
of
two
designs
a
confusion
more
or
less
masked
by
tolstoy
imperturbable
ease
of
manner
but
revealed
by
the
look
of
his
novel
when
it
is
seen
as
a
whole
it
has
no
centre
and
tolstoy
is
so
clearly
unconcerned
by
the
lack
that
one
must
conclude
he
never
perceived
it
if
he
had
he
would
surely
have
betrayed
that
he
had
he
would
have
been
found
at
some
point
or
other
trying
to
gather
his
two
stories
into
one
devising
a
scheme
that
would
include
them
both
establishing
a
centre
somewhere
but
no
he
strides
through
his
book
without
any
such
misgiving
and
really
it
is
his
assurance
that
gives
it
such
an
air
of
lucidity
he
would
only
have
flawed
its
surface
by
attempting
to
force
the
material
on
his
hands
into
some
sort
of
unity
its
incongruity
is
fundamental
and
when
we
add
as
we
must
that
war
and
peace
with
all
this
is
one
of
the
great
novels
of
the
world
a
picture
of
life
that
has
never
been
surpassed
for
its
grandeur
and
its
beauty
there
is
a
moment
when
all
our
criticism
perhaps
seems
trifling
what
does
it
matter
the
business
of
the
novelist
is
to
create
life
and
here
is
life
created
indeed
the
satisfaction
of
a
clean
coherent
form
is
wanting
and
it
would
be
well
to
have
it
but
that
is
all
we
have
a
magnificent
novel
without
it
so
we
have
but
we
might
have
had
a
more
magnificent
still
and
a
novel
that
would
not
be
novel
merely
this
war
and
peace
with
the
addition
of
another
excellence
a
comeliness
of
form
we
might
have
had
a
novel
that
would
be
a
finer
truer
more
vivid
and
more
forcible
picture
of
life
the
best
form
is
that
which
makes
the
most
of
its
subject
there
is
no
other
definition
of
the
meaning
of
form
in
fiction
the
book
is
the
book
in
which
the
subject
and
the
form
coincide
and
are
indistinguishable
the
book
in
which
the
matter
is
all
used
up
in
the
form
in
which
the
form
expresses
all
the
matter
where
there
is
disagreement
and
conflict
between
the
two
there
is
stuff
that
is
superfluous
or
there
is
stuff
that
is
wanting
the
form
of
the
book
as
it
stands
before
us
has
failed
to
do
justice
to
the
idea
in
war
and
peace
as
it
seems
to
me
the
story
suffers
twice
over
for
the
imperfection
of
the
form
it
is
damaged
in
the
first
place
by
the
importation
of
another
and
an
irrelevant
story
damaged
because
it
so
loses
the
sharp
and
clear
relief
that
it
would
have
if
it
stood
alone
whether
the
story
was
to
be
the
drama
of
youth
and
age
or
the
drama
of
war
and
peace
in
either
case
it
would
have
been
incomparably
more
impressive
if
the
great
wealth
of
the
material
had
been
used
for
its
purpose
all
brought
into
one
design
and
furthermore
in
either
case
again
the
story
is
incomplete
neither
of
them
is
finished
neither
of
them
is
given
its
full
development
for
all
the
size
of
the
book
but
to
this
point
at
least
in
relation
to
one
of
the
two
i
shall
return
directly
tolstoy
novel
is
wasteful
of
its
subject
that
is
the
whole
objection
to
its
loose
unstructural
form
criticism
bases
its
conclusion
upon
nothing
whatever
but
the
injury
done
to
the
story
the
loss
of
its
full
potential
value
is
there
so
much
that
is
good
in
war
and
peace
that
its
inadequate
grasp
of
a
great
theme
is
easily
forgotten
it
is
not
only
easily
forgotten
it
is
scarcely
noticed
on
a
first
reading
of
the
book
i
speak
at
least
for
one
reader
but
with
every
return
to
it
the
book
that
have
been
is
more
insistent
it
obtrudes
more
plainly
each
time
interfering
with
the
book
that
is
each
time
in
fact
it
becomes
harder
to
make
a
book
of
it
at
all
instead
of
holding
together
more
firmly
with
every
successive
reconstruction
its
prodigious
members
seem
always
more
disparate
and
disorganized
they
will
not
coalesce
a
subject
one
and
whole
and
irreducible
a
novel
can
not
begin
to
take
shape
till
it
has
this
for
its
support
it
seems
obvious
yet
there
is
nothing
more
familiar
to
a
of
than
the
difficulty
of
discovering
what
the
novel
in
his
hand
is
about
what
was
the
novelist
intention
in
a
phrase
if
it
can
not
be
put
into
a
phrase
it
is
no
subject
for
a
novel
and
the
size
or
the
complexity
of
a
subject
is
in
no
way
limited
by
that
assertion
it
may
be
the
simplest
anecdote
or
the
most
elaborate
concatenation
of
events
it
may
be
a
solitary
figure
or
the
widest
network
of
relationships
it
is
anyhow
expressible
in
ten
words
that
reveal
its
unity
the
form
of
the
book
depends
on
it
and
until
it
is
known
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
of
the
form
iv
but
now
suppose
that
tolstoy
had
not
been
drawn
aside
from
his
first
story
in
the
midst
of
it
suppose
he
had
left
the
epic
of
his
country
and
the
historians
to
be
dealt
with
in
another
book
suppose
that
the
interpolated
scenes
of
war
and
peace
as
we
possess
it
were
to
disappear
and
to
leave
the
subject
entirely
to
the
young
heroes
and
heroines
what
shall
we
find
to
be
the
form
of
the
book
which
is
thus
disencumbered
i
would
try
to
think
away
from
the
novel
all
that
is
not
owned
and
dominated
by
these
three
brilliant
households
besukhov
bolkonsky
rostov
there
remains
a
long
succession
of
scenes
in
a
single
and
straightforward
train
of
action
it
is
still
a
novel
of
ample
size
it
spreads
from
the
moment
when
peter
amiably
uncouth
first
appears
in
a
of
the
social
world
to
the
evening
fifteen
years
later
when
he
is
watched
with
speechless
veneration
by
the
small
boy
nicolenka
herald
of
the
future
the
climax
of
his
life
the
climax
of
half
a
dozen
lives
is
surmounted
between
these
two
points
and
now
their
story
stands
by
itself
it
gains
i
could
feel
by
this
process
of
liberation
summary
as
it
is
at
any
rate
it
is
one
theme
and
one
book
and
the
question
of
its
form
may
be
further
pressed
the
essential
notion
out
of
which
this
book
sprang
i
suggested
was
that
of
the
march
of
life
the
shift
of
the
generations
in
their
order
a
portentous
subject
to
master
but
tolstoy
hand
is
broad
and
he
is
not
afraid
of
great
spaces
such
a
subject
could
not
be
treated
at
all
without
a
generous
amount
of
room
for
its
needs
it
requires
to
begin
with
a
big
and
various
population
a
few
selected
figures
may
hold
the
main
thread
of
the
story
and
represent
its
course
but
it
is
necessary
for
their
typical
truth
that
their
place
in
the
world
should
be
clearly
seen
they
are
choice
examples
standing
away
from
the
mass
but
their
meaning
would
be
lost
if
they
were
taken
to
be
utterly
exceptional
if
they
appeared
to
be
chosen
they
are
exceptional
their
attachment
to
the
general
drama
of
life
must
accordingly
be
felt
and
understood
the
effect
of
a
wide
world
must
be
given
opening
away
to
far
distances
round
the
action
of
the
centre
the
whole
point
of
the
action
is
in
its
representative
character
its
universality
this
it
must
plainly
wear
it
begins
to
do
so
at
once
from
the
very
first
with
less
hesitation
apparently
than
another
man
might
feel
in
setting
the
scene
of
a
street
or
parish
tolstoy
proceeds
to
make
his
world
daylight
seems
to
well
out
of
his
page
and
to
surround
his
characters
as
fast
as
he
sketches
them
the
darkness
lifts
from
their
lives
their
conditions
their
outlying
affairs
and
leaves
them
under
an
open
sky
in
the
whole
of
fiction
no
scene
is
so
continually
washed
by
the
common
air
free
to
us
all
as
the
scene
of
tolstoy
his
people
move
in
an
atmosphere
that
knows
no
limit
beyond
the
few
that
are
to
the
fore
there
stretches
a
receding
crowd
with
many
faces
in
full
light
and
many
more
that
are
scarcely
discerned
as
faces
but
that
swell
the
impression
of
swarming
life
there
is
no
perceptible
horizon
no
hard
line
between
the
life
in
the
book
and
the
life
beyond
it
the
communication
between
the
men
and
women
of
the
story
and
the
rest
of
the
world
is
unchecked
it
is
impossible
to
say
of
peter
and
andrew
and
nicholas
that
they
inhabit
a
world
of
their
own
as
the
people
in
a
so
often
appear
to
do
they
inhabit
world
like
anybody
else
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
a
marked
horizon
drawn
round
the
action
of
a
book
and
excluding
everything
that
does
not
belong
to
it
is
not
perfectly
appropriate
often
enough
their
own
world
may
be
all
that
the
people
need
may
be
the
world
that
best
reveals
what
they
are
to
be
and
to
do
it
all
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
fable
but
to
tolstoy
fable
space
is
essential
with
the
sense
of
the
continuity
of
life
within
and
without
the
circle
of
the
book
he
never
seems
even
to
know
that
there
can
be
any
difficulty
in
providing
it
while
he
writes
it
is
there
he
is
helped
one
might
imagine
by
the
simple
immensity
of
his
russian
landscape
filled
with
the
suggestion
of
distances
and
unending
levels
the
russian
novelist
who
counts
on
this
effect
has
it
ready
to
his
hand
if
he
is
to
render
an
impression
of
space
that
widens
and
widens
a
hint
is
enough
the
mere
association
of
his
picture
with
the
thought
of
those
illimitable
plains
might
alone
enlarge
it
to
the
utmost
of
his
need
the
imagination
of
distance
is
everywhere
not
only
in
a
free
prospect
where
sight
is
lost
but
on
any
where
the
course
of
the
stream
lies
across
a
continent
or
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
whence
the
forest
stretches
round
the
curve
of
the
globe
to
isolate
a
patch
of
that
huge
field
and
to
cut
it
off
from
the
encompassing
air
might
indeed
seem
to
be
the
greater
difficulty
how
can
the
eye
be
held
to
a
point
when
the
very
name
of
russia
is
extent
without
measure
at
our
end
of
europe
where
space
is
more
precious
life
is
divided
and
specialized
and
differentiated
but
over
there
such
economies
are
unnecessary
there
is
no
need
to
define
one
own
world
and
to
live
within
it
when
there
is
a
single
world
large
enough
for
all
the
horizon
of
a
russian
story
would
naturally
be
vague
and
vast
it
might
seem
it
might
seem
so
at
least
if
the
fiction
of
dostoevsky
were
not
there
with
an
example
exactly
opposed
to
the
manner
of
tolstoy
the
serene
and
impartial
day
that
arches
from
verge
to
verge
in
war
and
peace
the
blackness
that
hems
in
the
ominous
circle
of
the
brothers
karamazov
it
is
a
perfect
contrast
dostoevsky
needed
no
lucid
prospect
round
his
strange
crew
all
he
sought
was
a
blaze
of
light
on
the
extraordinary
theatre
of
their
consciousness
he
intensified
it
by
shutting
off
the
least
glimmer
of
natural
day
the
illumination
that
falls
upon
his
page
is
like
the
glare
of
a
it
searches
the
depths
of
the
inner
struggles
and
turmoils
in
which
his
drama
is
enacted
relieving
it
with
sharp
and
fantastic
shadows
that
is
all
it
requires
and
therefore
the
curtain
of
darkness
is
drawn
thickly
over
the
rest
of
the
world
who
can
tell
in
dostoevsky
grim
what
there
is
at
the
end
of
the
street
what
lies
round
the
next
corner
night
stops
the
view
or
rather
no
ordinary
earthly
night
but
a
sudden
opacity
a
fog
that
can
not
be
pierced
or
breathed
with
tolstoy
nobody
doubts
that
an
ample
vision
opens
in
every
direction
it
may
be
left
untold
but
his
men
and
women
have
only
to
lift
their
eyes
to
see
it
how
is
it
contrived
the
mere
multiplication
of
names
and
households
in
the
book
does
not
account
for
it
the
effect
i
speak
of
spreads
far
beyond
them
it
is
not
that
he
has
imagined
so
large
an
army
of
characters
it
is
that
he
manages
to
give
them
such
freedom
such
an
obvious
latitude
of
movement
in
the
open
world
description
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
there
is
very
little
description
in
war
and
peace
save
in
the
that
i
am
not
now
considering
and
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
if
tolstoy
people
have
evident
lives
of
their
own
beyond
the
limits
of
the
book
it
is
because
he
understands
and
knows
them
so
well
because
they
are
so
real
to
him
because
they
and
all
their
circumstances
are
so
sharply
present
to
his
imagination
who
has
ever
known
so
much
about
his
own
creations
as
balzac
and
who
has
ever
felt
that
balzac
people
had
the
freedom
of
a
bigger
world
than
that
very
solid
and
definite
habitation
he
made
for
them
there
must
be
another
explanation
and
i
think
one
may
discern
where
it
lies
though
it
would
take
me
too
far
to
follow
it
it
lies
perhaps
in
the
fact
that
with
tolstoy
high
poetic
genius
there
went
a
singularly
normal
and
everyday
gift
of
experience
genius
of
his
sort
generally
means
i
dare
say
that
the
possessor
of
it
is
struck
by
special
and
wonderful
aspects
of
the
world
his
vision
falls
on
it
from
a
peculiar
angle
cutting
into
unsuspected
sides
of
common
facts
as
a
painter
sees
a
quality
in
a
face
that
other
people
never
saw
so
it
is
with
balzac
and
so
it
is
in
their
different
ways
with
such
writers
as
stendhal
and
maupassant
or
again
as
dickens
and
meredith
they
all
create
a
world
of
their
own
tolstoy
seems
to
look
squarely
at
the
same
world
as
other
people
and
only
to
make
so
much
more
of
it
than
other
people
by
the
direct
force
of
his
genius
not
because
he
holds
a
different
position
in
regard
to
it
his
experience
comes
from
the
same
quarter
as
ours
it
is
because
he
absorbs
so
much
more
of
it
and
because
it
all
passes
into
his
great
plastic
imagination
that
it
seems
so
new
his
people
therefore
are
essentially
familiar
and
intelligible
we
easily
extend
their
lives
in
any
direction
instead
of
finding
ourselves
checked
by
the
difficulty
of
knowing
more
about
them
than
the
author
tells
us
in
so
many
words
of
this
kind
of
genius
i
take
tolstoy
to
be
the
supreme
instance
among
novelists
fielding
and
scott
and
thackeray
are
of
the
family
but
i
do
not
linger
over
a
matter
that
for
my
narrow
argument
is
a
the
continuity
of
space
and
of
daylight
then
so
necessary
to
the
motive
of
the
book
is
rendered
in
war
and
peace
with
absolute
mastery
there
is
more
or
there
is
not
so
much
to
be
said
of
the
way
in
which
the
long
flight
of
time
through
the
expanse
of
the
book
is
imagined
and
pictured
the
passage
of
time
the
effect
of
time
belongs
to
the
heart
of
the
subject
if
we
could
think
of
war
and
peace
as
a
book
still
to
be
written
this
no
doubt
would
seem
to
be
the
greatest
of
its
demands
the
subject
is
not
given
at
all
unless
the
movement
of
the
wheel
of
time
is
made
perceptible
i
suppose
there
is
nothing
that
is
more
difficult
to
ensure
in
a
novel
merely
to
lengthen
the
series
of
stages
and
developments
in
the
action
will
not
ensure
it
there
is
no
help
in
the
simple
ranging
of
fact
beside
fact
to
suggest
the
lapse
of
a
certain
stretch
of
time
a
novelist
might
as
well
fall
back
on
the
row
of
stars
and
the
unsupported
announcement
that
years
have
fled
it
is
a
matter
of
the
build
of
the
whole
book
the
form
of
time
is
to
be
represented
and
that
is
something
more
than
to
represent
its
contents
in
their
order
if
time
is
of
the
essence
of
the
book
the
lines
and
masses
of
the
book
must
show
it
time
is
in
war
and
peace
but
that
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
it
will
cover
a
great
many
years
they
are
in
fact
no
more
than
the
years
between
youth
and
middle
age
but
though
the
wheel
may
not
travel
very
far
in
the
action
as
we
see
it
there
must
be
no
doubt
of
the
great
size
of
the
wheel
it
must
seem
to
turn
in
a
large
circumference
though
only
a
part
of
its
journey
is
to
be
watched
the
revolution
of
life
marked
by
the
rising
and
sinking
of
a
certain
generation
such
is
the
story
and
the
years
that
tolstoy
treats
fifteen
or
so
may
be
quite
enough
to
show
the
sweep
of
the
curve
at
a
man
is
still
beginning
at
forty
i
do
not
say
that
at
forty
he
is
already
ending
though
tolstoy
in
his
ruthless
way
is
prepared
to
suggest
it
but
by
that
time
there
are
clear
and
intelligent
eyes
like
the
boy
nicolenka
fixed
enquiringly
upon
a
man
the
eyes
of
the
who
are
suddenly
everywhere
and
all
about
him
making
ready
to
begin
in
their
turn
as
soon
as
that
happens
the
curve
of
time
is
apparent
the
story
is
told
but
it
must
be
apparent
in
the
book
the
shape
of
the
story
must
give
the
reason
for
telling
it
the
purpose
of
the
author
in
chronicling
his
facts
can
we
feel
that
tolstoy
has
so
represented
the
image
of
time
the
part
that
time
plays
in
his
book
the
problem
was
twofold
there
was
first
of
all
the
steady
progression
the
accumulation
of
the
years
to
be
portrayed
and
then
the
rise
and
fall
of
their
curve
it
is
the
double
effect
of
time
its
uninterrupted
lapse
and
the
cycle
of
which
the
chosen
stretch
is
a
segment
i
can
not
think
there
is
much
doubt
about
the
answer
to
my
question
tolstoy
has
achieved
one
aspect
of
his
handful
of
years
with
rare
and
exquisite
art
he
has
troubled
himself
very
little
about
the
other
time
that
evenly
and
silently
slips
away
while
the
men
and
women
talk
and
act
and
forget
it
time
that
is
read
in
their
faces
in
their
gestures
in
the
changing
texture
of
their
thought
while
they
only
themselves
awake
to
the
discovery
that
it
is
passing
when
the
best
of
it
has
gone
time
in
this
aspect
is
present
in
war
and
peace
more
manifestly
perhaps
than
in
any
other
novel
that
could
be
named
unless
it
were
another
novel
of
tolstoy
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
matter
of
the
of
his
fifteen
years
they
are
there
in
the
story
with
their
whole
effect
he
is
the
master
of
the
changes
of
age
in
a
human
being
under
his
hand
young
men
and
women
grow
older
cease
to
be
young
grow
old
with
the
noiseless
regularity
of
life
their
mutability
never
hides
their
sameness
their
consistency
shows
and
endures
through
their
disintegration
they
grow
as
we
all
do
they
change
in
the
only
possible
direction
that
which
results
from
the
clash
between
themselves
and
their
conditions
if
i
looked
for
the
most
beautiful
illustration
in
all
fiction
of
a
woman
at
the
mercy
of
time
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
years
now
facing
it
with
what
she
is
presently
betraying
and
recording
it
with
what
she
becomes
i
should
surely
find
it
in
the
story
of
anna
karenina
various
and
exquisite
as
she
is
her
whole
nature
is
sensitive
to
the
imprint
of
time
and
the
way
in
which
time
invades
her
steals
throughout
her
finally
lays
her
low
tolstoy
tracks
and
renders
from
end
to
end
and
in
war
and
peace
his
hand
is
not
less
delicate
and
firm
the
progress
of
time
is
never
broken
inexorably
it
does
what
it
must
carrying
an
enthusiastic
young
student
forward
into
a
slatternly
philosopher
of
middle
life
linking
an
matron
with
the
memory
of
a
girl
dancing
into
a
crowded
room
the
years
move
on
and
on
there
is
no
missing
the
sense
of
their
flow
but
the
meaning
the
import
what
i
should
like
to
call
the
moral
of
it
all
what
of
that
tolstoy
has
shown
us
a
certain
length
of
journey
but
to
what
end
has
he
shown
it
the
question
has
to
be
answered
and
it
is
not
answered
it
is
only
postponed
if
we
say
that
the
picture
itself
is
all
the
moral
all
the
meaning
that
we
are
entitled
to
ask
for
it
is
of
the
picture
that
we
speak
its
moral
is
in
its
design
and
without
design
the
scattered
scenes
will
make
no
picture
our
answer
would
be
clear
enough
as
i
have
tried
to
suggest
if
we
could
see
in
the
form
of
the
novel
an
image
of
the
circling
sweep
of
time
but
to
a
broad
and
single
effect
such
as
that
the
chapters
of
the
book
refuse
to
adapt
themselves
they
will
not
draw
together
and
announce
a
reason
for
their
collocation
the
story
is
started
with
every
promise
and
it
ceases
at
the
end
with
an
air
of
considerable
finality
but
between
these
points
its
course
is
full
of
doubt
it
is
admirably
started
nothing
could
be
more
right
and
true
than
the
bubbling
merriment
and
the
good
faith
and
the
impatient
aspiration
with
which
the
young
life
of
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
book
comes
surging
upon
the
scene
of
its
elders
a
current
of
newness
and
freshness
is
set
flowing
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
generation
that
is
still
in
possession
the
talk
of
a
political
is
stale
and
shrill
an
old
man
in
his
seclusion
is
a
useless
encumbrance
an
and
conventional
couple
are
living
without
plan
or
purpose
all
the
futility
of
these
people
is
obvious
to
an
onlooker
from
the
moment
when
their
sons
and
daughters
break
in
upon
them
it
was
time
for
the
new
generation
to
appear
and
behold
it
appearing
in
lively
strength
tolstoy
with
his
power
of
making
an
eloquent
event
out
of
nothing
at
all
needs
no
dramatic
apparatus
to
set
off
the
effect
of
the
irruption
two
people
an
elderly
man
of
the
world
and
a
scheming
hostess
are
talking
together
the
room
fills
a
young
man
enters
or
in
another
sociable
assembly
there
is
a
shriek
and
a
rush
and
the
children
of
the
house
charge
into
the
circle
that
is
quite
enough
for
tolstoy
his
drama
of
youth
and
age
opens
immediately
with
the
right
impression
the
story
is
in
movement
without
delay
there
are
a
few
glimpses
of
this
kind
and
then
the
scene
is
ready
the
action
may
go
forward
everything
is
attuned
for
the
effect
it
is
to
make
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
book
after
many
hundreds
of
pages
the
story
is
brought
to
a
full
close
in
an
episode
which
gathers
up
all
the
threads
and
winds
them
together
the
youths
and
maidens
are
now
the
parents
of
another
riotous
brood
not
one
of
them
has
ended
where
he
or
she
expected
to
end
but
their
lives
have
taken
a
certain
shape
and
it
is
unmistakable
that
this
shape
is
final
nothing
more
will
happen
to
them
which
an
onlooker
can
not
easily
foretell
they
have
settled
down
upon
their
lines
and
very
comfortable
and
very
estimable
lines
on
the
whole
and
there
may
be
many
years
of
prosperity
before
them
but
they
no
longer
possess
the
future
that
was
sparkling
with
possibility
a
few
years
ago
peter
is
as
full
of
schemes
as
ever
but
who
now
supposes
that
he
will
anything
natasha
is
absorbed
in
her
children
like
a
motherly
hen
nicholas
the
young
cavalier
is
a
country
gentleman
they
are
all
what
they
were
bound
to
be
though
nobody
foresaw
it
but
shyly
lurking
in
a
corner
late
in
the
evening
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
elders
of
the
party
who
are
talking
and
arguing
here
once
more
is
that
same
uncertain
romantic
incalculable
future
the
last
word
is
with
the
new
generation
the
budding
morrow
old
enough
now
to
be
musing
and
speculating
over
its
own
visions
yes
i
will
do
such
things
says
nicolenka
and
that
is
the
natural
end
of
the
story
but
meanwhile
the
story
has
rambled
and
wandered
uncontrolled
or
controlled
only
by
tolstoy
perfect
consistency
in
the
treatment
of
his
characters
they
as
i
have
said
are
never
less
than
absolutely
true
to
themselves
wherever
we
meet
them
in
peace
or
war
they
are
always
the
people
we
know
the
same
as
ever
and
yet
changing
and
changing
like
all
the
people
we
know
under
the
touch
of
time
it
is
not
they
it
is
their
story
that
falters
the
climax
i
suppose
must
be
taken
to
fall
in
the
great
scenes
of
the
burning
of
moscow
with
which
all
their
lives
are
so
closely
knit
peter
involves
himself
in
a
tangle
of
misfortunes
as
he
would
of
course
by
his
slipshod
enthusiasm
natasha
courage
and
good
sense
are
surprisingly
aroused
one
had
hardly
seen
that
she
possessed
such
qualities
but
tolstoy
is
right
and
presently
it
is
andrew
the
one
and
member
of
the
circle
who
is
lost
to
it
in
the
upheaval
wounded
and
brought
home
to
die
it
is
a
beautiful
and
human
story
of
its
kind
but
note
that
it
has
entirely
dropped
the
representative
character
which
it
wore
at
the
beginning
and
is
to
pick
up
again
at
the
end
tolstoy
has
forgotten
about
this
partly
he
has
been
too
much
engrossed
in
his
historical
picture
and
partly
he
has
fallen
into
a
new
manner
of
handling
the
loves
and
fortunes
of
his
young
people
it
is
now
a
tale
of
a
group
of
men
and
women
with
their
of
affinities
a
tale
of
which
the
centre
of
interest
lies
in
the
way
in
which
their
mutual
relations
will
work
out
it
is
the
kind
of
story
we
expect
to
find
in
any
novel
a
drama
of
young
affections
extraordinarily
true
and
poetic
as
tolstoy
traces
it
but
a
limited
affair
compared
with
the
theme
of
his
first
chapters
of
that
theme
there
is
no
continuous
development
the
details
of
the
charming
career
of
natasha
for
example
have
no
bearing
on
it
at
all
natasha
is
the
delightful
girl
of
her
time
and
of
all
time
as
nicholas
is
the
delightful
boy
and
she
runs
through
the
sequence
of
moods
and
that
she
properly
should
she
is
one
whose
fancy
is
quick
and
who
easily
follows
it
but
in
the
large
drama
of
which
she
is
a
part
it
is
not
the
actual
course
of
her
that
has
any
importance
it
is
the
fact
that
she
has
them
that
she
is
what
she
is
that
every
one
loves
her
and
that
she
is
ready
to
love
nearly
every
one
to
do
as
tolstoy
does
to
bring
into
the
middle
of
the
interest
the
question
whether
she
will
marry
this
man
or
that
especially
when
it
is
made
as
exquisitely
interesting
as
he
makes
it
this
is
to
throw
away
the
value
that
she
had
and
to
give
her
another
of
a
different
sort
entirely
at
the
of
the
book
and
long
before
the
is
reached
she
is
simply
the
heroine
of
a
particular
story
what
she
been
tolstoy
made
it
quite
clear
was
the
heroine
of
a
much
more
general
story
when
she
came
dancing
in
on
the
crest
of
the
new
wave
it
is
a
change
of
attitude
and
of
method
on
tolstoy
part
he
sees
the
facts
of
his
story
from
a
different
point
of
view
and
represents
them
in
a
fresh
light
it
does
not
mean
that
he
modifies
their
course
that
he
forces
them
in
a
wrong
direction
and
makes
natasha
act
in
a
manner
conflicting
with
his
first
idea
she
acts
and
behaves
consistently
with
her
nature
exactly
as
the
story
demands
that
she
should
not
one
of
her
impulsive
proceedings
need
be
sacrificed
but
it
was
for
tolstoy
representing
them
to
behave
consistently
too
and
to
use
the
facts
in
accordance
with
his
purpose
he
had
a
reason
for
taking
them
in
hand
a
design
which
he
meant
them
to
express
and
his
vacillation
prevents
them
from
expressing
it
how
would
he
have
treated
the
story
supposing
that
he
had
kept
hold
of
his
original
reason
throughout
are
we
prepared
to
improve
upon
his
method
to
his
book
as
we
think
it
ought
to
have
been
written
well
at
any
rate
it
is
possible
to
imagine
the
different
effect
it
would
show
if
a
little
of
that
large
humane
irony
so
evident
in
the
tone
of
the
story
at
the
start
had
persisted
through
all
its
phases
it
would
not
have
dimmed
natasha
charm
it
would
have
heightened
it
while
she
is
simply
the
heroine
of
a
romance
she
is
enchanting
no
doubt
but
when
she
takes
her
place
in
a
drama
so
much
greater
than
herself
her
beauty
is
infinitely
enhanced
she
becomes
representative
with
all
her
gifts
and
attractions
she
is
there
not
because
she
is
a
beautiful
creature
but
because
she
is
the
spirit
of
youth
her
charm
is
then
universal
it
belongs
to
the
spirit
of
youth
and
lasts
for
ever
with
all
this
i
think
it
begins
to
be
clear
why
the
broad
lines
of
tolstoy
book
have
always
seemed
uncertain
and
confused
neither
his
subject
nor
his
method
were
fixed
for
him
as
he
wrote
he
ranged
around
his
mountain
of
material
attacking
it
now
here
and
now
there
never
deciding
in
his
mind
to
what
end
he
had
amassed
it
none
of
his
various
schemes
is
thus
completed
none
of
them
gets
the
full
advantage
of
the
profusion
of
life
which
he
commands
at
any
moment
great
masses
of
that
life
are
being
wasted
turned
to
no
account
and
the
result
is
not
merely
negative
for
at
any
moment
the
wasted
life
the
stuff
that
is
not
being
used
is
dividing
and
weakening
the
effect
of
the
picture
created
out
of
the
rest
that
so
much
remains
in
spite
of
everything
gives
the
measure
of
tolstoy
genius
becomes
the
more
extraordinary
as
the
chaotic
plan
of
his
book
is
explored
he
could
work
with
such
lordly
neglect
of
his
subject
and
yet
he
could
produce
such
a
book
it
is
surely
as
much
as
to
say
that
tolstoy
is
the
supreme
genius
among
novelists
v
and
next
of
the
different
methods
by
which
the
form
of
a
novel
is
created
these
must
be
watched
in
a
very
different
kind
of
book
from
tolstoy
for
a
sight
of
the
large
and
general
masses
in
which
a
novel
takes
shape
war
and
peace
seemed
to
promise
more
than
another
but
something
a
great
deal
more
finely
controlled
is
to
be
looked
for
when
it
is
a
question
of
following
the
novelist
hand
while
it
is
actually
at
work
not
indeed
that
anybody
hand
is
more
delicate
than
tolstoy
at
certain
moments
and
for
certain
effects
and
a
critic
is
bound
to
come
back
to
him
again
in
connection
with
these
but
we
have
seen
how
in
dealing
with
his
book
one
is
continually
distracted
by
the
question
of
its
subject
the
uncertainty
of
tolstoy
intention
is
always
getting
between
the
reader
and
the
detail
of
his
method
what
i
now
want
therefore
will
be
a
book
in
which
the
subject
is
absolutely
fixed
and
determined
so
that
it
may
be
possible
to
consider
the
manner
of
its
treatment
with
undivided
attention
it
is
not
so
easy
to
find
as
might
be
supposed
or
rather
it
might
be
difficult
to
find
but
for
the
fact
that
immediately
in
a
critic
path
always
ready
to
hand
and
unavoidable
there
lies
one
book
of
exactly
the
sort
i
seek
flaubert
madame
bovary
whatever
this
book
may
be
or
may
not
be
after
much
it
remains
perpetually
the
novel
of
all
novels
which
the
criticism
of
fiction
can
not
overlook
as
soon
as
ever
we
speak
of
the
principles
of
the
art
we
must
be
prepared
to
engage
with
flaubert
this
is
an
accepted
necessity
among
critics
and
no
doubt
there
is
every
reason
why
it
should
be
so
the
art
of
flaubert
gives
at
any
rate
a
perfectly
definite
standard
there
is
no
mistaking
or
it
he
is
not
of
those
who
present
many
aspects
offering
the
support
of
one
or
other
to
different
critical
doctrines
flaubert
has
only
one
word
to
say
and
it
is
impossible
to
find
more
than
a
single
meaning
in
it
he
establishes
accordingly
a
point
in
the
sphere
of
criticism
a
point
which
is
convenient
to
us
all
we
can
refer
to
it
at
any
time
in
the
full
assurance
that
its
position
is
the
same
in
everybody
view
he
provides
the
critic
with
a
motionless
pole
and
for
my
particular
purpose
just
now
there
is
no
such
book
as
his
bovary
for
it
is
a
novel
in
which
the
subject
stands
firm
and
clear
without
the
least
shade
of
ambiguity
to
break
the
line
which
bounds
it
the
story
of
its
treatment
may
be
traced
without
missing
a
single
link
it
is
copiously
commented
upon
as
we
know
in
the
published
letters
of
its
author
through
the
long
years
in
which
phrase
was
being
added
to
phrase
and
it
is
curious
indeed
to
listen
to
him
day
by
day
and
to
listen
in
vain
for
any
hint
of
trouble
or
embarrassment
in
the
matter
of
his
subject
he
was
capable
of
hating
and
reviling
his
unfortunate
story
and
of
talking
about
it
with
a
kind
of
exasperated
spite
as
though
it
had
somehow
got
possession
of
him
unfairly
and
he
owed
it
a
grudge
for
having
crossed
his
mind
that
is
strange
enough
but
that
is
quite
a
different
affair
his
personal
resentment
of
the
intrusion
of
such
a
book
upon
him
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
difficulty
he
found
in
writing
it
his
classic
agonies
were
caused
by
no
unruliness
in
the
story
he
had
to
tell
his
imagined
book
was
rooted
in
his
thought
and
never
left
its
place
by
a
hair
breadth
year
after
year
he
worked
upon
his
subject
without
finding
anything
in
it
apparently
to
disturb
or
distract
him
in
his
continuous
effort
to
treat
it
to
write
it
out
to
his
satisfaction
this
was
the
only
difficulty
there
was
no
question
of
struggling
with
a
subject
that
he
had
not
entirely
mastered
one
that
broke
out
with
unforeseen
demands
bovary
never
needed
to
be
held
down
with
one
hand
while
it
was
written
with
the
other
many
a
novelist
making
a
further
and
fuller
acquaintance
with
his
subject
as
he
proceeds
discovering
more
in
it
to
reckon
with
than
he
had
expected
has
to
meet
the
double
strain
it
would
seem
but
flaubert
kept
his
book
in
a
marvellous
state
of
quiescence
during
the
writing
of
it
through
all
the
torment
which
it
cost
him
there
was
no
hour
when
it
presented
a
new
or
uncertain
look
to
him
he
might
hate
his
subject
but
it
never
disappointed
or
disconcerted
him
in
bovary
accordingly
the
methods
of
the
art
are
thrown
into
clear
relief
the
story
stands
obediently
before
the
author
with
all
its
developments
and
illustrations
the
characters
defined
the
small
incidents
disposed
in
order
his
sole
thought
is
how
to
present
the
story
how
to
tell
it
in
a
way
that
will
give
the
effect
he
desires
how
to
show
the
little
collection
of
facts
so
that
they
may
announce
the
meaning
he
sees
in
them
i
speak
of
his
telling
the
story
but
of
course
he
has
no
idea
of
doing
that
and
no
more
the
art
of
fiction
does
not
begin
until
the
novelist
thinks
of
his
story
as
a
matter
to
be
to
be
so
exhibited
that
it
will
tell
itself
to
hand
over
to
the
reader
the
facts
of
the
story
merely
as
so
much
information
this
is
no
more
than
to
state
the
argument
of
the
book
the
groundwork
upon
which
the
novelist
proceeds
to
create
the
book
is
not
a
row
of
facts
it
is
a
single
image
the
facts
have
no
validity
in
themselves
they
are
nothing
until
they
have
been
used
it
is
not
the
simple
art
of
narrative
but
the
comprehensive
art
of
fiction
that
i
am
considering
and
in
fiction
there
can
be
no
appeal
to
any
authority
outside
the
book
itself
narrative
like
the
tales
of
defoe
for
example
must
look
elsewhere
for
support
defoe
produced
it
by
the
assertion
of
the
historic
truthfulness
of
his
stories
but
in
a
novel
strictly
so
called
attestation
of
this
kind
is
of
course
quite
irrelevant
the
thing
has
to
true
and
that
is
all
it
is
not
made
to
look
true
by
simple
statement
and
yet
the
novelist
must
state
must
tell
must
narrate
what
else
can
he
do
his
book
is
a
series
of
assertions
nothing
more
it
is
so
obviously
and
the
difference
between
the
art
of
defoe
and
the
art
of
flaubert
is
only
in
their
different
method
of
placing
their
statements
defoe
takes
a
directer
way
flaubert
a
more
roundabout
but
the
deviations
open
to
flaubert
are
innumerable
and
by
his
method
by
his
various
methods
we
mean
his
manner
of
choosing
his
path
having
chosen
he
follows
it
certainly
by
means
of
a
plain
narrative
he
relates
a
succession
of
facts
whether
he
is
describing
the
appearance
of
emma
or
one
of
her
moods
or
something
that
she
did
but
this
common
necessity
of
statement
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
is
assumed
at
the
beginning
and
in
criticizing
fiction
we
may
proceed
as
though
a
novelist
could
really
deal
immediately
with
appearances
we
may
talk
of
the
picture
or
the
drama
that
he
creates
we
may
plainly
say
that
he
avoids
mere
statement
altogether
because
at
the
level
of
fiction
the
whole
interest
is
in
another
region
we
are
simply
concerned
with
the
method
by
which
he
selects
the
information
he
offers
a
writer
like
flaubert
or
like
any
novelist
whose
work
supports
criticism
at
all
is
so
far
from
telling
a
story
as
it
might
be
told
in
an
official
report
that
we
cease
to
regard
him
as
reporting
in
any
sense
he
is
making
an
effect
and
an
impression
by
some
more
or
less
skilful
method
contemplating
his
finished
work
we
can
distinguish
the
method
perhaps
define
it
notice
how
it
changes
from
time
to
time
and
account
for
the
novelist
choice
of
it
there
is
plenty
of
diversity
of
method
in
madame
bovary
though
the
story
is
so
simple
what
does
it
amount
to
that
story
charles
bovary
a
simple
and
young
country
doctor
makes
a
prudent
marriage
and
has
the
fortune
to
lose
his
tiresome
and
elderly
wife
after
no
long
time
then
he
falls
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
a
pretty
and
fanciful
young
woman
who
marries
him
she
is
deeply
bored
by
existence
in
a
small
market
town
finds
a
lover
wearies
of
him
and
finds
another
gets
wildly
into
debt
poisons
herself
and
dies
after
her
death
bovary
discovers
the
proof
of
her
infidelity
but
his
slow
brain
is
too
much
bewildered
by
sorrow
and
worry
by
life
generally
to
feel
another
pang
very
distinctly
he
soon
dies
himself
that
is
all
the
story
given
as
an
argument
and
so
summarized
it
tells
us
nothing
of
flaubert
subject
there
might
be
many
subjects
in
such
an
anecdote
many
different
points
of
view
from
which
the
commonplace
facts
might
make
a
book
the
way
in
which
they
are
presented
will
entirely
depend
on
the
particular
subject
that
flaubert
sees
in
them
until
this
is
apparent
the
method
can
not
be
criticized
but
the
method
can
be
watched
and
immediately
it
is
to
be
noted
that
flaubert
handles
his
material
quite
differently
from
point
to
point
sometimes
he
seems
to
be
describing
what
he
has
seen
himself
places
and
people
he
has
known
conversations
he
may
have
overheard
i
do
not
mean
that
he
is
literally
retailing
an
experience
of
his
own
but
that
he
writes
as
though
he
were
his
description
in
that
case
touches
only
such
matters
as
you
or
i
might
have
perceived
for
ourselves
if
we
had
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
at
the
moment
his
object
is
to
place
the
scene
before
us
so
that
we
may
take
it
in
like
a
picture
gradually
unrolled
or
a
drama
enacted
but
then
again
the
method
presently
changes
there
comes
a
juncture
at
which
for
some
reason
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
know
more
than
we
could
have
made
out
by
simply
looking
and
listening
flaubert
the
author
of
the
story
must
intervene
with
his
superior
knowledge
perhaps
it
is
something
in
the
past
of
the
people
who
have
been
moving
and
talking
on
the
scene
you
can
not
rightly
understand
this
incident
or
this
talk
the
author
implies
unless
you
know
what
i
now
proceed
to
tell
you
and
so
for
a
new
light
on
the
drama
the
author
recalls
certain
circumstances
that
we
should
otherwise
have
missed
or
it
may
be
that
he
who
naturally
knows
everything
even
the
inmost
unexpressed
thought
of
the
characters
wishes
us
to
share
the
mind
of
bovary
or
of
emma
not
to
wait
only
on
their
words
or
actions
and
so
he
goes
below
the
surface
enters
their
consciousness
and
describes
the
train
of
sentiment
that
passes
there
these
are
the
familiar
resources
of
a
which
everybody
uses
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
so
natural
to
take
advantage
of
them
that
unless
we
purposely
keep
an
eye
upon
the
writer
devices
marking
them
off
as
he
turns
from
one
to
another
we
hardly
notice
the
change
he
is
telling
a
story
in
the
ordinary
way
the
obvious
and
unconstrained
but
in
fact
these
variations
represent
differences
of
method
that
are
fundamental
if
the
story
is
to
be
to
us
the
question
of
our
relation
to
the
story
how
we
are
placed
with
regard
to
it
arises
with
the
first
word
are
we
placed
before
a
particular
scene
an
occasion
at
a
certain
selected
hour
in
the
lives
of
these
people
whose
fortunes
are
to
be
followed
or
are
we
surveying
their
lives
from
a
height
participating
in
the
privilege
of
the
novelist
sweeping
their
history
with
a
wide
range
of
vision
and
absorbing
a
general
effect
here
at
once
is
a
necessary
alternative
flaubert
as
a
matter
of
fact
gives
us
first
a
scene
the
scene
of
bovary
arrival
at
school
as
a
small
boy
the
incident
of
the
particular
morning
is
rendered
and
then
he
leaves
that
incident
summarizes
the
background
of
the
boy
life
describes
his
parents
the
conditions
of
his
home
his
later
career
as
a
student
it
is
the
way
in
which
nine
novels
out
of
ten
begin
an
opening
scene
a
retrospect
and
a
summary
and
the
spectator
the
reader
is
so
well
used
to
it
that
he
is
conscious
of
no
violent
change
in
the
point
of
view
though
what
has
happened
is
that
from
one
moment
to
another
he
has
been
caught
up
from
a
position
straight
in
front
of
the
action
to
a
higher
and
a
more
commanding
level
from
which
a
stretch
of
time
is
to
be
seen
outspread
this
then
is
one
distinction
of
method
and
it
is
a
fact
that
even
in
this
elementary
matter
our
nomenclature
is
uncertain
and
ambiguous
how
do
we
habitually
discriminate
between
these
absolutely
diverse
manners
of
presenting
the
facts
of
a
story
i
scarcely
know
it
is
as
though
we
had
no
received
expressions
to
mark
the
difference
between
blue
and
red
but
let
us
assume
at
any
rate
that
a
scenic
and
a
panoramic
presentation
of
a
story
expresses
an
intelligible
antithesis
strictly
and
technically
there
is
our
relation
again
ours
the
reader
with
regard
to
the
author
flaubert
is
generally
considered
to
be
a
very
impersonal
writer
one
who
keeps
in
the
background
and
desires
us
to
remain
unaware
of
his
presence
he
places
the
story
before
us
and
suppresses
any
comment
of
his
own
but
this
point
has
been
i
should
say
it
only
means
that
flaubert
does
not
announce
his
opinion
in
so
many
words
and
thence
it
has
been
argued
that
the
opinions
of
a
really
artistic
writer
ought
not
to
appear
in
his
story
at
all
but
of
course
with
every
touch
that
he
lays
on
his
subject
he
must
show
what
he
thinks
of
it
his
subject
indeed
the
book
which
he
finds
in
his
selected
fragment
of
life
is
purely
the
representation
of
his
view
his
judgement
his
opinion
of
it
the
famous
impersonality
of
flaubert
and
his
kind
lies
only
in
the
greater
tact
with
which
they
express
their
feelings
dramatizing
them
embodying
them
in
living
form
instead
of
stating
them
directly
it
is
not
to
this
matter
flaubert
opinion
of
emma
bovary
and
her
history
which
indeed
is
unmistakable
that
i
refer
in
speaking
of
our
relation
to
the
writer
of
the
book
it
is
a
matter
of
method
sometimes
the
author
is
talking
with
his
own
voice
sometimes
he
is
talking
one
of
the
people
in
the
book
in
this
book
for
the
most
part
emma
herself
thus
he
describes
a
landscape
the
trim
in
which
emma
lot
is
cast
or
the
appearance
and
manners
of
her
neighbours
or
her
own
behaviour
and
in
so
doing
he
is
using
his
own
language
and
his
own
standards
of
appreciation
he
is
facing
the
reader
in
person
however
careful
he
may
be
to
say
nothing
to
deflect
our
attention
from
the
thing
described
he
is
making
a
reproduction
of
something
that
is
in
his
own
mind
and
then
later
on
he
is
using
the
eyes
and
the
mind
and
the
standards
of
another
the
landscape
has
now
the
colour
that
it
wears
in
emma
view
the
incident
is
caught
in
the
aspect
which
it
happens
to
turn
towards
her
imagination
flaubert
himself
has
retreated
and
it
is
emma
with
whom
we
immediately
deal
take
for
example
the
two
figures
of
her
lovers
rodolphe
and
léon
the
florid
and
the
aspiring
student
if
flaubert
were
to
describe
these
men
as
sees
them
apart
from
their
significance
to
emma
they
would
not
occupy
him
for
long
to
his
mind
and
to
any
critical
mind
they
are
both
of
them
very
small
affairs
their
whole
effect
in
the
book
is
the
effect
they
produce
upon
the
sensibility
of
a
foolish
and
limited
little
woman
or
again
take
the
incident
of
emma
single
incursion
into
polite
society
the
ball
at
the
great
house
which
starts
so
many
of
her
romantic
dreams
it
is
all
presented
in
her
terms
it
appears
as
it
appeared
to
her
and
occasionally
the
point
of
view
is
shifted
away
from
her
to
somebody
else
and
we
get
a
brief
glimpse
of
what
is
in
the
eyes
of
her
husband
her
her
lover
furthermore
whether
the
voice
is
that
of
the
author
or
of
his
creature
there
is
a
pictorial
manner
of
treating
the
matter
in
hand
and
there
is
also
a
dramatic
it
may
be
that
the
impression
as
in
the
case
of
the
marquis
ball
is
chiefly
given
as
a
picture
the
reflection
of
events
in
the
mirror
of
somebody
receptive
consciousness
the
reader
is
not
really
looking
the
occasion
in
the
least
or
only
now
and
then
mainly
he
is
watching
the
surge
of
emma
emotion
on
which
the
episode
acts
with
sharp
intensity
the
thing
is
scenic
in
the
sense
in
which
i
used
the
word
just
now
we
are
concerned
that
is
to
say
with
a
single
and
particular
hour
we
are
taking
no
extended
general
view
of
emma
experience
but
though
it
is
thus
a
it
is
not
dramatically
rendered
if
you
took
the
dialogue
what
there
is
of
it
together
with
the
actual
things
described
the
people
and
the
dresses
and
the
dances
and
the
banquets
took
these
and
placed
them
on
the
stage
for
a
theatrical
performance
the
peculiar
effect
of
the
occasion
in
the
book
would
totally
vanish
nothing
could
be
more
definite
more
objective
than
the
scene
is
in
the
book
but
there
it
is
all
bathed
in
the
climate
of
emma
mood
and
it
is
to
the
nature
of
this
climate
that
our
interest
is
called
for
the
moment
the
lords
and
ladies
are
remote
envying
and
wondering
excitement
fills
the
whole
of
the
foreground
the
scene
is
pictorially
treated
but
then
look
on
to
the
incident
of
the
the
at
yonville
with
the
crowd
in
the
the
and
the
this
scene
like
the
other
is
rendered
on
the
whole
but
flaubert
method
is
always
a
little
mixed
for
reasons
to
be
noted
presently
from
emma
point
of
view
she
sits
beside
rodolphe
while
he
makes
his
advances
to
her
under
cover
of
the
councillor
eloquence
and
she
looks
out
upon
the
assembly
and
as
she
sees
it
so
the
throng
and
the
glare
are
imparted
to
the
reader
but
remark
that
on
this
occasion
the
facts
of
the
scene
are
well
to
the
fore
emma
mood
counts
for
very
little
and
we
get
a
direct
view
of
the
things
on
which
her
eyes
casually
rest
we
hear
the
councillor
rhetorical
periods
rodolphe
tender
speeches
replies
with
the
rumour
of
the
crowd
breaking
through
from
time
to
time
it
is
a
scene
which
might
be
put
upon
the
stage
quite
conceivably
without
any
loss
of
the
main
impression
it
is
made
to
convey
in
the
book
an
impression
of
ironic
contrast
of
the
bustle
and
jostle
round
the
oration
of
the
pompous
dignitary
of
the
commonplace
little
romance
that
is
being
broached
unobserved
to
receive
the
force
of
the
contrast
the
reader
has
only
to
see
and
hear
to
be
present
while
the
hour
passes
and
the
author
places
him
there
accordingly
in
front
of
the
visible
and
audible
facts
of
the
case
and
leaves
it
to
these
to
tell
the
story
it
is
a
scene
treated
dramatically
this
is
a
difference
of
method
that
constantly
catches
a
critic
eye
in
reading
a
novel
is
the
author
writing
at
a
given
moment
with
his
attention
upon
the
incidents
of
his
tale
or
is
he
regarding
primarily
the
form
and
colour
they
assume
in
somebody
thought
he
will
do
both
it
is
probable
in
the
course
of
his
book
on
the
same
page
perhaps
or
even
in
the
same
sentence
nothing
compels
him
to
forego
the
advantage
of
either
method
if
his
story
can
profit
in
turn
from
both
now
and
then
indeed
we
shall
find
a
writer
deliberately
confining
himself
to
one
method
only
treating
his
whole
book
with
a
rigid
consistency
and
this
for
the
sake
of
some
particular
aspect
of
his
theme
which
an
unmixed
manner
is
best
fitted
to
reveal
but
generally
a
novelist
retains
his
liberty
to
draw
upon
any
of
his
resources
as
he
chooses
now
this
one
and
now
that
using
drama
where
drama
gives
him
all
he
needs
using
pictorial
description
where
the
turn
of
the
story
demands
it
the
only
law
that
binds
him
throughout
whatever
course
he
is
pursuing
is
the
need
to
be
consistent
on
plan
to
follow
the
principle
he
has
adopted
and
of
course
it
is
one
of
the
first
of
his
precepts
as
with
every
artist
in
any
kind
to
allow
himself
no
more
latitude
than
he
requires
a
critic
then
looks
for
the
principle
on
which
a
novelist
methods
are
mingled
and
varied
looks
for
it
as
usual
in
the
novelist
subject
and
marks
its
application
as
the
subject
is
developed
and
so
with
the
devices
that
i
distinguish
as
scenic
and
panoramic
one
watches
continually
to
see
how
this
alternation
is
managed
how
the
story
is
now
overlooked
from
a
height
and
now
brought
immediately
to
the
level
of
the
reader
here
again
the
need
of
the
story
may
sometimes
seem
to
pull
decisively
in
one
direction
or
the
other
and
we
get
a
book
that
is
mainly
a
broad
and
general
survey
or
mainly
a
concatenation
of
particular
scenes
but
on
the
whole
we
expect
to
find
that
the
scene
presently
yields
to
some
kind
of
chronicle
or
summary
and
that
this
in
turn
prepares
the
way
and
leads
into
the
occasion
that
fulfils
it
the
placing
of
this
occasion
at
the
point
where
everything
is
ready
for
it
where
it
will
thoroughly
illuminate
a
new
face
of
the
subject
and
advance
the
action
by
a
definite
stage
is
among
the
chief
cares
of
the
author
i
take
it
in
planning
his
book
a
scene
that
is
not
really
wanted
and
that
nothing
in
particular
a
scene
that
for
lack
of
preparation
fails
to
make
its
effect
is
a
weakness
in
a
story
that
one
would
suppose
a
novelist
to
be
always
guarding
against
anyhow
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
scene
holds
the
place
of
honour
that
it
is
the
readiest
means
of
starting
an
interest
and
raising
a
question
we
drop
into
a
scene
on
the
first
page
and
begin
to
speculate
about
the
people
concerned
in
it
and
that
it
recurs
for
a
climax
of
any
sort
the
resolution
of
the
question
and
so
the
scene
completes
what
it
began
in
madame
bovary
the
scenes
are
distributed
and
rendered
with
very
rare
skill
not
one
but
seems
to
have
more
and
more
to
give
with
every
fresh
reading
of
it
the
ball
the
the
evening
at
the
theatre
fateful
interview
with
léon
in
the
cathedral
of
rouen
the
remarkable
session
of
the
priest
and
the
apothecary
at
her
deathbed
these
form
the
articulation
of
the
book
the
scheme
of
its
structure
to
the
next
in
order
each
stage
of
the
story
is
steadily
directed
by
the
time
the
scene
is
reached
nothing
is
wanting
to
its
opportunity
the
action
is
ripe
the
place
is
resonant
and
then
the
incident
takes
up
the
story
conclusively
establishes
one
aspect
of
it
and
opens
the
view
towards
the
next
and
the
more
rapid
summary
that
succeeds
with
its
pauses
for
a
momentary
sight
of
emma
daily
life
and
its
setting
carries
the
book
on
once
more
to
the
climax
that
already
begins
to
appear
in
the
distance
but
the
most
obvious
point
of
method
is
no
doubt
the
difficult
question
of
the
centre
of
vision
with
which
of
the
characters
if
with
any
of
them
is
the
writer
to
identify
himself
which
is
he
to
go
behind
which
of
these
vessels
of
thought
and
feeling
is
he
to
reveal
from
within
i
suppose
his
unwritten
story
to
rise
before
him
its
main
lines
settled
as
something
at
first
entirely
objective
the
whole
thing
seen
from
without
the
linked
chain
of
incident
the
men
and
women
in
their
places
and
it
may
be
that
the
story
can
be
kept
in
this
condition
while
it
is
written
and
that
the
completed
book
will
be
nothing
but
an
account
of
things
seen
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
author
standing
outside
the
action
without
any
divulging
of
anybody
thought
but
this
is
rare
such
restraint
is
burdensome
unless
in
a
very
compact
and
straightforward
tale
somewhere
the
author
must
break
into
the
privacy
of
his
characters
and
open
their
minds
to
us
and
again
it
is
doubtless
his
purpose
to
shift
the
point
of
view
no
more
often
than
he
need
and
if
the
subject
can
be
completely
rendered
by
showing
it
as
it
appears
to
a
single
one
of
the
figures
in
the
book
then
there
is
no
reason
to
range
further
haphazard
and
unnecessary
plunges
into
the
inner
life
of
the
characters
only
confuse
the
effect
changing
the
focus
without
compensating
gain
but
which
the
centre
which
is
the
mind
that
really
commands
the
subject
the
answer
is
not
always
evident
at
once
nor
does
it
seem
to
be
always
correctly
divined
in
the
novels
that
we
read
but
of
course
in
plenty
of
stories
there
can
be
little
doubt
there
is
somebody
in
the
middle
of
the
action
who
is
clearly
the
person
to
interpret
it
for
us
and
the
action
will
accordingly
be
faced
from
his
or
her
position
in
flaubert
bovary
there
could
be
no
question
but
that
we
must
mainly
use
the
eyes
of
emma
herself
the
middle
of
the
subject
is
in
her
experience
not
anywhere
in
the
concrete
facts
around
her
and
yet
flaubert
finds
it
necessary
as
i
said
to
look
her
occasionally
taking
advantage
of
some
other
centre
for
the
time
being
and
why
he
does
so
a
nearer
inspection
of
his
subject
will
soon
show
here
we
have
then
the
elements
of
the
novelist
method
essentially
few
and
simple
but
infinite
in
their
possibilities
of
fusion
and
combination
they
are
arranged
in
a
new
design
to
suit
every
new
theme
that
a
writer
takes
in
hand
we
see
them
alternated
united
imposed
one
on
another
this
point
of
view
blended
with
that
dramatic
action
treated
pictorially
pictorial
description
rendered
dramatically
and
these
words
i
use
throughout
it
will
be
understood
in
the
special
sense
that
i
have
indicated
in
work
it
is
always
interesting
to
discover
how
method
tends
to
be
laid
upon
method
so
that
we
get
as
it
were
layers
and
stratifications
in
the
treatment
of
a
story
some
of
these
i
shall
try
to
distinguish
and
the
search
is
useful
i
think
for
an
understanding
of
the
novelist
himself
for
though
it
is
true
that
a
man
method
depends
upon
the
particular
story
he
is
engaged
in
telling
yet
the
story
that
occurs
to
him
the
subject
he
happens
upon
will
be
that
which
asks
for
the
kind
of
treatment
congenial
to
his
hand
and
so
his
method
will
be
a
part
of
himself
and
will
tell
us
about
the
quality
of
his
imagination
but
this
by
the
way
my
concern
is
only
with
the
manner
in
which
the
thing
is
done
and
having
glanced
at
some
of
the
features
of
that
manner
in
flaubert
bovary
i
may
now
seek
the
reason
of
them
in
a
more
attentive
handling
of
the
book
vi
if
flaubert
allows
himself
the
liberty
of
telling
his
story
in
various
ways
with
a
method
that
is
to
say
which
is
often
modified
as
he
proceeds
it
is
likely
that
he
has
good
cause
to
do
so
weighing
every
word
and
calculating
every
effect
so
patiently
he
could
not
have
been
casual
and
careless
over
his
method
he
would
not
take
one
way
rather
than
another
because
it
saved
him
trouble
or
because
he
failed
to
notice
that
there
were
other
ways
or
because
they
all
seemed
to
him
much
the
same
and
yet
at
first
sight
it
does
seem
that
his
manner
of
arriving
at
his
subject
if
his
subject
is
emma
bovary
is
considerably
casual
he
begins
with
charles
of
all
people
charles
her
husband
the
stupid
soul
who
falls
heavily
in
love
with
her
prettiness
and
never
has
the
glimmer
of
an
understanding
of
what
she
is
and
he
begins
with
the
early
history
of
charles
and
his
upbringing
and
the
irrelevant
first
marriage
that
his
mother
forces
upon
him
and
his
widowhood
and
then
it
happens
that
charles
has
a
professional
visit
to
pay
to
a
certain
farm
the
farmer
daughter
happens
to
be
emma
and
so
we
finally
stumble
upon
the
subject
of
the
book
is
that
the
neatest
possible
mode
of
striking
it
but
flaubert
seems
to
be
very
sure
of
himself
and
it
is
not
uninteresting
to
ask
exactly
what
he
means
as
for
his
subject
it
is
of
course
emma
bovary
in
the
first
place
the
book
is
the
portrait
of
a
foolish
woman
romantically
inclined
in
small
and
prosaic
conditions
she
is
in
the
centre
of
it
all
certainly
there
is
no
doubt
of
her
position
in
the
book
but
is
she
there
the
true
subject
of
the
novel
is
not
given
as
we
saw
by
a
mere
summary
of
the
course
which
is
taken
by
the
story
she
may
be
there
for
her
own
sake
simply
or
for
the
sake
of
the
predicament
in
which
she
stands
she
may
be
presented
as
a
curious
scrap
of
character
fit
to
be
studied
or
flaubert
may
have
been
struck
by
her
as
the
instrument
the
victim
the
occasion
of
a
particular
train
of
events
perhaps
she
is
a
creature
portrayed
because
he
thinks
her
typical
and
picturesque
perhaps
she
is
a
disturbing
little
force
let
loose
among
the
lives
that
surround
her
perhaps
on
the
other
hand
she
is
a
hapless
sufferer
in
the
clash
between
her
aspirations
and
her
fate
given
emma
and
what
she
is
by
nature
given
her
environment
and
the
facts
of
her
story
there
are
dozens
of
different
subjects
i
dare
say
latent
in
the
case
the
woman
the
men
all
they
say
and
do
the
whole
scene
behind
them
none
of
it
gives
any
clue
to
the
right
manner
of
treating
them
the
one
irreducible
idea
out
of
which
the
book
as
flaubert
wrote
it
unfolds
this
it
is
that
must
be
sought
now
if
emma
was
devised
for
her
own
sake
solely
because
a
nature
and
a
temper
like
hers
seemed
to
flaubert
an
amusing
study
if
his
one
aim
was
to
make
the
portrait
of
a
woman
of
that
kind
then
the
rest
of
the
matter
falls
into
line
we
shall
know
how
to
regard
it
these
conditions
in
which
emma
finds
herself
will
have
been
chosen
by
the
author
because
they
appeared
to
throw
light
on
her
to
call
out
her
natural
qualities
to
give
her
the
best
opportunity
of
disclosing
what
she
is
her
stupid
husband
and
her
fascinating
lovers
will
enter
the
scene
in
order
that
she
may
become
whatever
she
has
it
in
her
to
be
flaubert
elects
to
place
her
in
a
certain
provincial
town
full
of
odd
characters
he
gives
the
town
and
its
folk
an
extraordinary
actuality
it
is
not
a
town
not
a
generalized
town
but
as
individual
and
recognizable
as
he
can
make
it
none
the
less
always
supposing
that
emma
by
herself
is
the
whole
of
his
subject
he
must
have
lit
on
this
particular
town
simply
because
it
seemed
to
explain
and
expound
her
better
than
another
if
he
had
thought
that
a
woman
of
her
sort
rather
meanly
ambitious
rather
fatuously
romantic
would
have
revealed
her
quality
more
intensely
in
a
different
world
in
success
freedom
wealth
he
would
have
placed
her
otherwise
charles
and
rodolphe
and
homard
and
the
rest
of
them
would
have
vanished
the
more
illuminating
set
of
circumstances
whatever
they
might
be
would
have
appeared
instead
emma
world
as
it
is
at
present
in
the
book
that
flaubert
wrote
would
have
to
be
regarded
accordingly
as
all
a
of
emma
invented
to
do
her
a
service
described
in
order
that
they
may
make
the
description
of
her
world
that
is
to
say
would
belong
to
the
treatment
of
the
story
none
of
it
not
her
husband
not
the
life
of
the
would
be
a
part
of
the
author
postulate
the
groundwork
of
his
fable
it
would
be
possible
to
imagine
a
different
setting
better
it
might
be
than
that
which
flaubert
has
chosen
all
this
the
subject
of
the
book
is
nothing
but
the
portrait
of
such
a
woman
but
of
course
it
is
not
so
one
glance
at
our
remembrance
of
the
book
is
enough
to
show
it
emma
world
could
not
be
other
than
it
is
she
could
not
be
shifted
into
richer
and
larger
conditions
without
destroying
the
whole
point
and
purpose
of
flaubert
novel
she
by
herself
is
not
the
subject
of
his
book
what
he
proposes
to
exhibit
is
the
history
of
a
woman
like
her
in
just
such
a
world
as
hers
a
foolish
woman
in
narrow
circumstances
so
that
the
provincial
scene
acting
upon
her
making
her
what
she
becomes
is
as
essential
as
she
is
herself
not
a
portrait
therefore
not
a
study
of
character
for
its
own
sake
but
something
in
the
nature
of
a
drama
where
the
two
chief
players
are
a
woman
on
one
side
and
her
whole
environment
on
the
other
that
is
madame
bovary
there
is
a
conflict
a
trial
of
strength
and
a
doubtful
issue
emma
is
not
much
of
a
force
no
doubt
her
impulses
are
wild
her
emotions
are
thin
and
poor
she
has
no
power
of
passion
with
which
to
fight
the
world
all
she
has
is
her
romantic
dream
and
her
plain
primitive
appetite
but
these
can
be
effective
arms
after
all
and
she
may
yet
succeed
in
getting
her
way
and
making
her
own
terms
on
the
other
hand
the
limitations
of
her
life
are
very
blank
and
uncompromising
indeed
they
close
all
round
her
hampering
her
flights
restricting
her
opportunities
the
drama
is
set
at
any
rate
whatever
may
come
of
it
emma
marries
her
husband
is
established
at
yonville
and
faced
with
the
poverty
of
her
situation
something
will
result
the
issue
will
announce
itself
it
is
the
mark
of
a
dramatic
case
that
it
contains
an
opposition
of
some
kind
a
pair
of
wills
that
collide
an
action
that
pulls
in
two
directions
and
so
far
madame
bovary
has
the
look
of
a
drama
flaubert
might
work
on
the
book
from
that
point
of
view
and
throw
the
emphasis
on
the
issue
the
middle
of
his
subject
would
then
be
found
in
the
struggle
between
emma
and
all
that
constitutes
her
life
between
her
romantic
dreams
and
her
besetting
facts
the
question
is
what
will
happen
but
then
again
that
is
not
exactly
the
question
in
this
book
obviously
the
emphasis
is
not
upon
the
commonplace
little
events
of
emma
career
they
might
no
doubt
be
the
steps
in
a
dramatic
tale
but
they
are
nothing
of
the
kind
as
flaubert
handles
them
he
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
his
view
is
not
centred
upon
the
actual
outcome
of
emma
predicament
whether
it
will
issue
this
way
or
that
she
does
or
fails
to
do
is
of
very
small
moment
her
passages
with
rodolphe
and
with
léon
are
pictures
that
pass
they
solve
nothing
they
lead
to
no
climax
rodolphe
final
rejection
of
her
for
example
is
no
scene
of
drama
deciding
a
question
that
has
been
held
in
suspense
it
is
one
of
emma
various
mischances
with
its
own
marked
effect
upon
but
it
does
not
stand
out
in
the
book
as
a
in
the
action
she
goes
her
way
and
acts
out
her
history
but
of
whatever
suspense
whatever
dramatic
value
there
might
be
in
it
flaubert
makes
nothing
he
evidently
considers
it
of
no
account
who
in
recalling
the
book
thinks
of
the
chain
of
incident
that
runs
through
it
compared
with
the
long
and
living
impression
of
a
few
of
the
people
in
it
and
of
the
place
in
which
they
are
set
none
of
the
events
really
matter
for
their
own
sake
they
might
have
happened
differently
not
one
of
them
is
indispensable
as
it
is
emma
must
certainly
have
made
what
she
could
of
her
opportunities
of
romance
but
they
need
not
necessarily
have
appeared
in
the
shape
of
léon
or
rodolphe
she
would
have
found
others
if
these
had
not
been
at
hand
the
therefore
emma
excursions
to
rouen
her
her
one
or
two
memorable
adventures
in
the
world
all
these
are
only
flaubert
way
of
telling
his
subject
of
making
it
count
to
the
eye
they
are
not
in
themselves
what
he
has
to
say
they
simply
illustrate
it
what
it
comes
to
i
take
it
is
that
though
madame
bovary
the
novel
is
a
kind
of
drama
since
there
is
the
interaction
of
this
woman
confronted
by
these
facts
it
is
a
drama
chosen
for
the
sake
of
the
picture
in
it
for
the
impression
it
gives
of
the
manner
in
which
certain
lives
are
lived
it
might
have
another
force
of
its
own
it
might
be
a
strife
of
characters
and
wills
in
which
the
men
and
women
would
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
and
make
all
the
interest
by
their
action
it
might
be
a
drama
say
as
jane
eyre
is
a
drama
where
another
obscure
little
woman
has
a
part
to
play
but
where
the
question
is
how
she
plays
it
what
she
achieves
or
misses
in
particular
to
flaubert
the
situation
out
of
which
he
made
his
novel
appeared
in
another
light
it
was
not
as
dramatic
as
it
was
pictorial
there
was
not
the
stuff
in
emma
more
especially
that
could
make
her
the
main
figure
of
a
drama
she
is
small
and
futile
she
could
not
well
uphold
an
interest
that
would
depend
directly
on
her
behaviour
but
for
a
picture
where
the
interest
depends
only
on
what
she
that
is
quite
different
her
futility
is
then
a
real
value
it
can
be
made
amusing
and
vivid
to
the
last
degree
so
long
as
no
other
weight
is
thrown
on
it
she
can
make
a
perfect
impression
of
life
though
she
can
not
create
much
of
a
story
let
emma
and
her
plight
therefore
appear
as
a
picture
let
her
be
shown
in
the
act
of
living
her
life
entangled
as
it
is
with
her
past
and
her
present
that
is
how
the
final
fact
at
the
heart
of
flaubert
subject
will
be
best
displayed
here
is
the
clue
it
seems
to
his
treatment
of
the
theme
it
is
pictorial
and
its
object
is
to
make
emma
existence
as
intelligible
and
visible
as
may
be
we
who
read
the
book
are
to
share
her
sense
of
life
till
no
uncertainty
is
left
in
it
we
are
to
see
and
understand
her
experience
and
to
see
while
she
enjoys
or
endures
it
we
are
to
be
placed
within
her
world
to
get
the
immediate
taste
of
it
and
outside
her
world
as
well
to
get
the
full
effect
more
of
it
than
she
herself
could
see
flaubert
subject
demands
no
less
if
the
picture
is
to
be
complete
she
herself
must
be
known
thoroughly
that
is
his
first
care
the
movement
of
her
mind
is
to
be
watched
at
work
in
all
the
ardour
and
the
poverty
of
her
imagination
how
she
creates
her
makeshift
romances
how
she
feeds
on
them
how
they
fail
her
it
is
all
part
of
the
picture
and
then
there
is
the
dull
and
limited
world
in
which
her
appetite
is
somehow
to
be
satisfied
the
small
town
that
shuts
her
in
and
cuts
her
off
this
too
is
to
be
rendered
and
in
order
to
make
it
clearly
tell
beside
the
figure
of
emma
it
must
be
as
distinct
and
individual
as
thoroughly
characterized
as
she
is
it
is
more
than
a
setting
for
emma
and
her
intrigue
it
belongs
to
the
book
integrally
much
more
so
than
the
accidental
lovers
who
fall
in
emma
way
they
are
mere
occasions
and
attractions
for
her
fancy
the
town
and
the
and
the
apothecary
and
the
other
indigenous
gossips
need
a
sharper
definition
and
accordingly
flaubert
treats
the
scenery
of
his
book
yonville
and
its
odd
types
as
intensely
as
he
treats
his
heroine
he
broods
over
it
with
concentration
and
gives
it
all
the
salience
he
can
the
town
with
its
life
is
not
behind
his
heroine
subdued
in
tone
to
make
a
background
it
is
her
no
less
fully
to
the
front
its
value
in
the
picture
is
as
strong
as
her
own
such
is
the
picture
that
flaubert
book
is
to
present
and
what
then
of
the
point
of
view
towards
which
it
is
to
be
directed
if
it
is
to
have
that
unity
which
it
needs
to
produce
its
right
effect
there
can
be
no
uncertainty
here
no
arbitrary
shifting
of
the
place
from
which
an
onlooker
faces
it
and
in
the
tale
of
madame
bovary
the
question
of
the
right
point
of
view
might
be
considerably
perplexing
where
is
flaubert
to
find
his
centre
of
vision
from
what
point
within
the
book
or
without
will
the
unfolding
of
the
subject
be
commanded
most
effectively
the
difficulty
is
this
that
while
one
aspect
of
his
matter
can
only
be
seen
from
within
through
the
eyes
of
the
woman
another
must
inevitably
be
seen
from
without
through
nobody
eyes
but
the
author
own
part
of
his
subject
is
sense
of
her
world
we
must
see
how
it
impresses
her
and
what
she
makes
of
it
how
it
thwarts
her
and
how
her
imagination
contrives
to
get
a
kind
of
sustenance
out
of
it
the
book
is
not
really
written
at
all
unless
it
shows
her
view
of
things
as
the
woman
she
was
in
that
place
in
those
conditions
for
this
reason
it
is
essential
to
pass
into
her
consciousness
to
make
her
and
flaubert
takes
care
to
do
so
and
to
make
her
so
as
soon
as
she
enters
the
book
but
it
is
also
enjoined
by
the
story
as
we
found
that
her
place
and
conditions
should
be
seen
for
what
they
are
and
known
as
intimately
as
herself
for
this
matter
emma
capacity
fails
her
intelligence
is
much
too
feeble
and
fitful
to
give
a
sufficient
account
of
her
world
the
town
of
yonville
would
be
very
poorly
revealed
to
us
if
flaubert
had
to
keep
within
the
measure
of
perceptions
it
would
be
thin
and
blank
it
would
be
barely
more
than
a
dull
background
for
the
beautiful
apparition
of
the
men
she
desires
what
were
her
neighbours
to
her
they
existed
in
her
consciousness
only
as
tiresome
interruptions
and
drawbacks
except
now
and
then
when
she
had
occasion
to
make
use
of
them
but
to
us
to
the
onlooker
they
belong
to
her
portrait
they
represent
the
dead
weight
of
provincial
life
which
is
the
outstanding
fact
in
her
case
emma
rudimentary
idea
of
them
is
entirely
inadequate
she
has
not
a
vestige
of
the
humour
and
irony
that
is
needed
to
give
them
shape
moreover
they
affect
her
far
more
forcibly
and
more
variously
than
she
could
even
suspect
a
sharper
wit
than
hers
must
evidently
intervene
helping
out
the
primitive
workings
of
her
mind
her
pair
of
eyes
is
not
enough
the
picture
beheld
through
them
is
a
poor
thing
in
itself
for
she
can
see
no
more
than
her
mind
can
grasp
and
it
does
her
no
justice
either
since
she
herself
is
so
largely
the
creation
of
her
surroundings
it
is
a
dilemma
that
appears
in
any
story
wherever
the
matter
to
be
represented
is
the
experience
of
a
simple
soul
or
a
dull
intelligence
if
it
is
the
experience
and
the
actual
taste
of
it
that
is
to
be
imparted
the
story
must
be
viewed
as
the
poor
creature
saw
it
and
yet
the
poor
creature
can
not
tell
the
story
in
full
a
shift
of
the
vision
is
necessary
and
in
madame
bovary
it
is
to
be
noted
there
is
no
one
else
within
the
book
who
is
in
a
position
to
take
up
the
tale
when
emma
fails
there
is
no
other
personage
upon
the
scene
who
sees
and
understands
any
more
than
she
perception
and
discrimination
are
not
to
be
found
in
yonville
at
all
it
is
an
essential
point
the
author
wit
therefore
and
none
other
must
supply
what
is
wanting
this
necessity
to
a
writer
of
flaubert
acute
sense
of
effect
is
one
that
demands
a
good
deal
of
caution
the
transition
must
be
made
without
awkwardness
without
calling
attention
to
it
flaubert
is
not
the
kind
of
who
will
leave
it
undisguised
he
will
not
begin
by
going
behind
emma
giving
her
view
and
then
openly
confessedly
revert
to
his
own
character
and
use
his
own
standards
there
is
nothing
more
disconcerting
in
a
novel
than
to
the
writer
changing
his
part
in
this
way
throwing
off
the
character
into
which
he
has
been
projecting
himself
and
taking
a
new
stand
outside
and
away
from
the
story
perhaps
it
is
only
thackeray
among
the
great
who
seems
to
find
a
positively
wilful
pleasure
in
damaging
his
own
story
by
open
maltreatment
of
this
kind
there
are
times
when
thackeray
will
even
boast
of
his
own
independence
insisting
in
so
many
words
on
his
freedom
to
say
what
he
pleases
about
his
men
and
women
and
to
make
them
behave
as
he
will
but
without
using
thackeray
licence
a
novelist
may
still
do
his
story
an
ill
turn
by
leaving
too
naked
a
contrast
between
the
subjective
picture
of
what
passes
through
mind
emma
or
becky
as
it
may
be
and
the
objective
rendering
of
what
he
sees
for
himself
between
the
experience
that
is
mirrored
in
another
thought
and
that
which
is
shaped
in
his
own
when
one
has
lived
the
experience
of
somebody
in
the
story
and
received
the
full
sense
of
it
to
be
wrenched
out
of
the
story
and
stationed
at
a
distance
is
a
shock
that
needs
to
be
softened
and
muffled
in
some
fashion
otherwise
it
may
weaken
whatever
was
true
and
valid
in
the
experience
for
here
is
a
new
view
of
it
external
and
detached
and
another
mind
at
work
the
author
and
that
sense
of
having
shared
the
life
of
the
person
in
the
story
seems
suddenly
unreal
flaubert
way
of
disguising
the
inconsistency
is
not
a
peculiar
art
of
his
own
i
dare
say
even
in
him
it
was
probably
quite
unconscious
well
as
he
was
aware
of
most
of
the
refinements
of
his
craft
and
perhaps
it
is
only
a
sleight
of
hand
that
might
come
naturally
to
any
good
but
it
is
interesting
to
follow
flaubert
method
to
the
very
end
for
it
holds
out
so
consummately
and
i
think
it
is
possible
to
define
it
here
i
should
say
then
that
he
deals
with
the
difficulty
i
have
described
by
keeping
emma
always
at
a
certain
distance
even
when
he
appears
to
be
entering
her
mind
most
freely
he
makes
her
subjective
places
us
so
that
we
see
through
her
eyes
yes
but
he
does
so
with
an
air
of
aloofness
that
forbids
us
ever
to
become
entirely
identified
with
her
this
is
how
she
thought
and
felt
he
seems
to
say
look
and
you
will
understand
such
is
the
soul
of
this
foolish
woman
a
hint
of
irony
is
always
perceptible
and
it
is
enough
to
prevent
us
from
being
lost
in
her
consciousness
immersed
in
it
beyond
easy
recall
the
woman
life
is
very
real
perfectly
felt
but
the
reader
is
made
to
accept
his
participation
in
it
as
a
pleasing
experiment
the
kind
of
thing
that
appeals
to
a
fastidious
curiosity
there
is
no
question
of
its
ever
being
more
than
this
the
of
emma
is
taken
with
entire
seriousness
of
course
she
is
there
to
be
studied
and
explored
and
no
means
of
understanding
her
point
of
view
will
be
neglected
but
her
value
is
another
matter
as
to
that
flaubert
never
has
an
instant
illusion
he
always
knows
her
to
be
worthless
he
knows
it
without
asserting
it
needless
to
say
his
valuation
of
her
is
only
implied
it
is
in
his
tone
never
in
his
words
which
invariably
respect
her
own
estimate
of
herself
his
irony
none
the
less
is
close
at
hand
and
indispensable
he
has
a
definite
use
for
this
resource
and
he
could
not
forego
it
his
irony
gives
him
perfect
freedom
to
supersede
emma
limited
vision
whenever
he
pleases
to
abandon
her
manner
of
looking
at
the
world
and
to
pass
immediately
to
his
own
more
enlightened
more
commanding
height
her
manner
was
utterly
convincing
while
she
exhibited
it
but
we
always
knew
that
a
finer
mind
was
watching
her
display
with
a
touch
of
disdain
from
time
to
time
it
leaves
her
and
begins
to
create
the
world
of
homard
and
binet
and
lheureux
and
the
rest
in
a
fashion
far
beyond
any
possible
conception
of
hers
yet
there
is
no
dislocation
here
no
awkward
substitution
of
one
set
of
values
for
another
very
discreetly
the
same
standard
has
reigned
throughout
that
is
the
way
in
which
flaubert
impersonality
so
called
artfully
operates
and
now
another
difficulty
there
is
still
more
that
is
needed
and
that
is
not
yet
provided
for
emma
must
be
placed
in
her
world
and
fitted
into
it
securely
some
glimpse
of
her
appearance
in
the
sight
of
those
about
her
this
too
we
look
for
to
make
the
whole
account
of
her
compact
and
complete
her
relation
to
her
husband
for
instance
is
from
her
side
expressed
very
clearly
in
her
view
of
him
which
we
possess
but
there
are
advantages
in
seeing
it
from
his
side
too
what
did
really
think
of
her
how
did
she
appear
to
him
light
on
this
question
not
only
makes
a
more
solid
figure
of
her
for
the
reader
but
it
also
brings
her
once
for
all
into
the
company
of
the
people
round
her
establishes
her
in
the
circle
of
their
experience
emma
from
within
we
have
seen
and
yonville
from
the
author
point
of
vantage
and
now
here
is
emma
from
a
point
by
her
very
side
when
the
seeing
eye
becomes
that
of
her
husband
flaubert
manages
this
ingeniously
making
his
procedure
serve
a
further
purpose
at
the
same
time
for
he
has
to
remember
that
his
story
does
not
end
with
the
death
of
emma
it
is
rounded
off
not
by
her
death
but
by
her
husband
discovery
of
her
long
faithlessness
when
in
the
first
days
of
his
mourning
he
lights
upon
the
packet
of
letters
that
betrays
her
the
end
of
the
story
is
in
the
final
stroke
of
irony
which
gives
the
man
this
glance
into
the
past
and
reveals
thereby
the
mental
and
emotional
confusion
of
his
being
since
his
only
response
is
a
sort
of
stupefied
perplexity
charles
must
be
held
in
readiness
so
to
speak
for
these
last
pages
his
inner
mind
and
his
point
of
view
must
be
created
in
advance
and
kept
in
reserve
so
that
the
force
of
the
climax
when
it
is
reached
may
be
instantly
felt
and
so
we
have
the
early
episodes
of
charles
youth
and
his
first
marriage
all
his
history
up
to
the
time
when
he
falls
in
emma
way
and
flaubert
questionable
manner
of
working
round
to
his
subject
is
explained
charles
will
be
needed
at
the
end
and
charles
is
here
firmly
set
on
his
feet
the
impression
of
emma
on
those
who
encounter
her
is
also
needed
and
here
it
is
and
the
whole
book
mainly
the
affair
of
emma
herself
is
effectively
framed
in
this
other
affair
that
of
charles
in
which
it
opens
and
closes
madame
bovary
is
a
book
so
we
have
always
been
told
and
so
we
find
it
to
be
pulling
it
to
pieces
and
putting
it
together
again
it
never
is
unrepaying
to
do
so
once
more
and
it
is
a
book
that
with
its
variety
of
method
and
with
its
careful
restriction
of
that
variety
to
its
bare
needs
and
with
its
scrupulous
use
of
its
resources
it
is
a
book
altogether
that
gives
a
good
point
of
departure
for
an
examination
of
the
methods
of
fiction
the
leading
notions
that
are
to
be
followed
are
clearly
laid
down
in
it
and
i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
say
that
is
not
in
some
sense
an
extension
and
an
amplification
of
hints
to
be
found
in
madame
bovary
for
that
reason
i
have
lingered
in
detail
over
the
treatment
of
a
story
about
which
in
other
connections
a
critic
might
draw
different
conclusions
i
remember
again
how
flaubert
vilified
his
subject
while
he
was
at
work
on
it
his
love
of
strong
colours
and
flavours
was
disgusted
by
the
drab
prose
of
such
a
story
so
he
thought
and
said
but
as
the
years
went
by
and
he
fought
his
way
from
one
chapter
to
another
did
he
begin
to
feel
that
it
was
not
much
of
a
subject
after
all
even
of
its
kind
it
is
not
clear
but
after
yet
another
of
the
book
one
wonders
afresh
it
is
not
a
fertile
subject
it
is
not
it
does
not
strain
and
struggle
for
development
it
only
submits
to
it
but
that
aspect
is
not
subject
and
madame
bovary
a
beautifully
finished
piece
of
work
is
for
my
purpose
singularly
fertile
vii
of
the
notions
on
the
subject
of
method
that
are
suggested
by
bovary
the
first
i
shall
follow
is
one
that
takes
me
immediately
without
any
doubt
whatever
into
the
world
of
thackeray
i
start
from
that
distinction
between
the
panoramic
and
the
scenic
presentation
of
a
story
which
i
noted
a
few
pages
ago
and
to
turn
towards
the
panorama
away
from
the
scene
is
to
be
confronted
at
once
with
vanity
fair
pendennis
the
newcomes
esmond
all
of
them
thackeray
saw
them
as
broad
expanses
stretches
of
territory
to
be
surveyed
from
edge
to
edge
with
a
sweeping
glance
he
saw
them
as
great
general
typical
impressions
of
life
populated
by
a
swarm
of
people
whose
manners
and
adventures
crowded
into
his
memory
the
landscape
lay
before
him
his
imagination
wandered
freely
across
it
backwards
and
forwards
the
whole
of
it
was
in
view
at
once
a
single
prospect
out
of
which
the
story
of
becky
or
pendennis
emerged
and
grew
distinct
while
he
watched
he
wrote
his
novel
with
a
mind
full
of
a
surge
and
wash
of
memories
the
tenor
of
which
was
somehow
to
be
conveyed
in
the
outward
form
of
a
narrative
and
though
his
novel
complies
with
that
form
more
or
less
and
a
number
of
events
are
marshalled
in
order
yet
its
constant
tendency
is
to
escape
and
evade
the
restrictions
of
a
scenic
method
and
to
present
the
story
in
a
continuous
flow
of
leisurely
contemplative
reminiscence
and
that
is
evidently
the
right
way
for
the
kind
of
story
that
thackeray
means
to
create
for
what
is
the
point
and
purpose
of
vanity
fair
where
is
the
centre
from
which
it
grows
can
it
be
described
as
a
plot
a
situation
an
entanglement
something
that
raises
a
question
of
the
issue
of
plots
in
this
sense
there
are
plenty
in
vanity
fair
at
least
there
are
two
becky
dominates
one
amelia
smiles
and
weeps
in
the
other
they
join
hands
occasionally
but
really
they
have
very
little
to
exchange
becky
and
her
crawleys
becky
and
her
meteoric
career
in
curzon
street
would
have
been
all
as
they
are
if
amelia
had
never
been
heard
of
and
bloomsbury
too
of
the
osbornes
and
the
sedleys
might
have
had
the
whole
book
to
itself
for
all
that
becky
essentially
matters
to
it
side
by
side
they
exist
and
for
thackeray
purpose
neither
is
more
important
than
the
other
neither
is
in
the
middle
of
the
book
as
it
stands
becky
seems
to
be
in
the
middle
certainly
as
we
think
of
her
but
that
is
not
where
thackeray
placed
her
he
meant
amelia
to
be
no
less
appealing
than
becky
is
striking
and
if
amelia
fails
and
drops
into
the
background
it
is
not
because
she
plays
a
subordinate
part
but
only
because
she
plays
it
with
so
much
less
than
becky
vivid
conviction
they
fill
the
book
with
incident
between
the
two
of
them
something
is
always
happening
from
the
moment
when
they
drive
out
of
miss
gate
at
chiswick
till
the
last
word
that
is
told
of
either
but
the
book
as
a
whole
turns
upon
nothing
that
happens
not
even
upon
the
catastrophe
of
curzon
street
that
scene
in
becky
disposes
of
it
leaves
the
rest
of
the
book
quite
untouched
not
in
any
complication
of
incident
therefore
nor
in
any
single
strife
of
will
is
the
subject
of
vanity
fair
to
be
discerned
it
is
now
here
but
in
the
impression
of
a
world
a
society
a
time
certain
manners
of
life
within
a
few
square
miles
of
london
a
hundred
years
ago
thackeray
flings
together
a
crowd
of
the
people
he
knows
so
well
and
it
matters
not
at
all
if
the
tie
that
holds
them
to
each
other
is
of
the
slightest
it
may
easily
chance
that
his
good
young
girl
and
his
young
adventuress
set
out
together
upon
their
journey
their
paths
may
even
cross
from
time
to
time
later
on
the
light
link
is
enough
for
the
unity
of
his
tale
for
that
unity
does
not
depend
on
an
intricately
woven
intrigue
it
depends
in
truth
upon
one
fact
only
the
fact
that
all
his
throng
of
men
and
women
are
strongly
picturesquely
typical
of
the
world
from
which
they
are
taken
that
all
in
their
different
ways
can
add
to
the
force
of
its
effect
the
book
is
not
the
story
of
any
of
them
it
is
the
story
which
they
unite
to
tell
a
chapter
in
the
notorious
career
of
london
exactly
how
the
various
plots
evolve
is
not
the
main
matter
behind
them
is
the
presence
and
the
pressure
of
a
greater
interest
the
mass
of
life
which
thackeray
packs
into
his
novel
and
if
that
is
the
meaning
of
vanity
fair
to
give
the
succession
of
incident
a
hard
particular
dramatic
relief
would
be
to
obscure
it
becky
valiant
struggle
in
the
world
of
her
ambition
might
easily
be
isolated
and
turned
into
a
play
no
doubt
it
has
been
but
consider
how
her
look
her
value
would
in
that
case
be
changed
her
story
would
become
a
mere
personal
affair
of
her
own
the
mischance
of
a
certain
woman
enterprise
given
in
thackeray
way
summarized
in
his
masterly
perspective
it
is
part
of
an
impression
of
manners
such
i
take
it
is
thackeray
difference
his
peculiar
mark
the
distinction
of
his
genius
he
is
a
painter
of
life
a
novelist
whose
matter
is
all
blended
and
harmonized
together
people
action
background
in
a
long
retrospective
vision
not
for
him
on
the
whole
is
the
detached
action
the
rounded
figure
the
scenic
rendering
of
a
story
as
surely
as
dickens
tended
towards
the
theatre
with
its
isolation
of
events
and
episodes
its
underlining
of
the
personal
and
the
individual
in
men
and
women
so
thackeray
preferred
the
manner
of
musing
expatiation
where
scene
melts
into
scene
impressions
are
foreshortened
by
distance
and
the
thought
can
linger
and
brood
as
it
will
every
novel
of
his
takes
the
general
form
of
a
discursive
soliloquy
in
which
he
gradually
gathers
up
the
long
train
of
experience
that
he
has
in
mind
the
early
chapters
of
esmond
or
pendennis
the
whole
fragment
of
denis
duval
are
perfect
examples
of
thackeray
way
when
he
is
most
himself
and
when
he
is
least
to
be
approached
by
any
other
writer
of
fiction
all
that
he
has
to
describe
so
it
seems
is
present
to
him
in
the
hour
of
recollection
he
hangs
over
it
and
his
eye
is
caught
by
a
point
here
and
there
a
child
with
a
book
in
a
the
fotheringay
cleaning
her
old
shoe
the
major
at
his
breakfast
in
pall
mall
the
associations
broaden
away
from
these
glimpses
and
are
followed
hither
and
thither
but
still
though
the
fullness
of
memory
is
directed
into
a
consecutive
tale
it
is
not
the
narrative
not
its
order
and
movement
that
chiefly
holds
either
thackeray
attention
or
ours
who
read
the
narrative
is
steeped
in
the
suffusion
of
the
general
tone
the
sensation
of
the
place
and
the
life
that
he
is
recalling
and
it
is
out
of
this
effect
insensibly
changing
and
developing
that
the
novel
is
created
for
a
nearer
sight
of
it
i
go
back
to
vanity
fair
the
chapters
that
are
concerned
with
becky
determined
siege
of
london
how
to
live
well
on
nothing
a
year
are
exactly
to
the
point
the
wonderful
things
that
thackeray
could
do
the
odd
lapse
of
his
power
when
he
had
to
go
beyond
his
particular
province
both
are
here
written
large
every
one
remembers
the
chapters
and
their
place
in
the
book
becky
resolutely
shaking
off
old
difficulties
for
the
moment
installs
herself
with
her
husband
in
the
heart
of
the
world
she
means
to
conquer
she
all
but
succeeds
she
just
fails
her
campaign
and
its
untimely
end
are
to
be
pictured
it
is
an
interlude
to
be
filled
with
stir
and
glitter
with
the
sense
of
the
passage
of
a
certain
time
above
all
with
intimations
of
insecurity
and
precarious
fortune
and
it
is
to
lead
this
it
must
do
to
a
scene
of
final
and
decisive
climax
such
is
the
effect
to
be
drawn
from
the
matter
that
thackeray
has
stored
up
the
whole
hierarchy
of
the
crawleys
steyne
gaunt
house
always
with
becky
in
the
midst
and
to
the
fore
up
to
a
point
it
is
precisely
the
kind
of
juncture
in
which
thackeray
art
delights
there
is
abundance
of
vivid
stuff
and
the
picture
to
be
made
of
it
is
highly
functional
in
the
book
it
is
not
merely
a
preparation
for
a
story
to
follow
it
is
itself
the
story
a
most
important
part
of
it
the
chapters
representing
becky
manner
of
life
in
curzon
street
make
the
hinge
of
her
career
she
approaches
her
at
the
beginning
of
them
she
is
past
it
at
the
end
functional
therefore
they
are
to
the
last
degree
but
up
to
the
very
climax
or
the
verge
of
it
there
is
no
need
for
a
set
scene
of
dramatic
particularity
an
impression
is
to
be
created
growing
and
growing
and
it
can
well
be
created
in
the
loose
panoramic
style
which
is
thackeray
paramount
arm
a
general
view
once
more
a
summary
of
becky
course
of
action
a
long
look
at
her
conditions
a
participation
in
her
gathering
difficulties
that
is
the
nature
and
the
task
of
these
chapters
that
is
what
thackeray
proceeds
to
give
us
he
sets
about
it
with
a
beautiful
ease
of
assurance
from
his
height
he
looks
forth
takes
in
the
effect
with
his
sweeping
vision
possesses
himself
of
the
gradation
of
its
tone
then
stooping
nearer
he
seizes
the
detail
that
renders
it
but
the
sense
of
the
broad
survey
is
first
in
his
thought
when
he
reflects
upon
becky
life
in
london
and
all
that
came
of
her
attempt
to
establish
herself
there
he
is
soon
assailed
by
a
score
of
definite
recollections
incidents
scraps
of
talk
that
show
how
things
were
going
with
her
but
these
it
would
seem
arise
by
the
way
they
spring
up
in
his
mind
as
he
reviews
the
past
they
illustrate
what
he
has
to
say
and
he
takes
advantage
of
them
he
brushes
past
them
however
without
much
delaying
or
particularizing
a
hint
a
moment
a
glance
suffices
for
the
contribution
that
some
event
or
colloquy
is
to
make
to
the
picture
note
for
example
how
unceremoniously
again
and
again
and
with
how
little
thought
of
disposing
a
deliberate
scene
he
drifts
into
his
account
of
something
that
becky
said
or
did
she
begins
to
talk
you
find
there
is
some
one
else
in
the
room
you
find
they
are
in
a
certain
room
at
a
certain
hour
definition
emerges
unawares
in
a
brooding
memory
briefly
to
all
appearance
quite
casually
the
little
incident
shows
itself
and
vanishes
there
is
a
pause
to
watch
and
listen
and
then
the
stream
sets
forward
again
by
so
much
enriched
and
reinforced
or
in
a
heightened
mood
as
in
the
picture
of
the
midnight
flurry
and
alarm
of
the
great
desolate
house
when
old
pitt
crawley
is
suddenly
struck
down
still
it
is
as
though
thackeray
circled
about
the
thought
of
the
time
and
place
offering
swift
and
piercing
glimpses
of
it
giving
no
continuous
and
dramatic
display
of
a
constituted
scene
that
foreshortening
and
generalizing
that
fusion
of
detail
that
subordination
of
the
instance
and
the
occasion
to
the
broad
effect
are
the
elements
of
the
pictorial
art
in
which
thackeray
is
so
great
a
master
so
long
as
it
is
a
matter
of
sketching
a
train
of
life
in
broad
free
strokes
the
poise
and
swing
of
his
style
are
beyond
praise
and
its
perfection
is
all
the
more
notable
that
it
stands
in
such
contrast
with
the
curious
drop
and
uncertainty
of
his
skill
so
soon
as
there
is
something
more
something
different
to
be
done
for
becky
dubious
adventure
has
its
climax
it
tends
towards
a
conclusion
and
the
final
scene
can
not
be
recalled
and
summarized
in
his
indirect
reminiscential
manner
it
must
be
placed
immediately
before
us
the
collapse
of
becky
plotting
and
scheming
must
be
enacted
in
full
view
if
it
is
to
have
its
proper
emphasis
and
rightly
round
off
her
career
hitherto
we
have
been
listening
to
thackeray
on
the
whole
while
he
talked
about
becky
talked
with
such
extraordinary
brilliance
that
he
evoked
her
in
all
her
ways
and
made
us
see
her
with
his
eyes
but
now
it
is
time
to
see
her
with
our
own
his
lively
interpretation
of
her
will
serve
no
longer
does
becky
fail
in
the
end
after
all
that
we
have
heard
of
her
struggle
it
has
become
the
great
question
and
the
force
of
the
answer
will
be
impaired
if
it
is
not
given
with
the
best
possible
warrant
the
best
possible
better
even
than
thackeray
wonderful
account
of
her
will
be
the
plain
and
immediate
of
the
answer
its
embodiment
in
a
scene
that
shall
pass
directly
in
front
of
us
the
method
that
was
not
demanded
by
the
preceding
phases
of
the
tale
is
here
absolutely
prescribed
becky
rawdon
steyne
must
now
take
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
and
show
themselves
without
any
other
intervention
hitherto
practically
throughout
they
have
been
the
creatures
of
thought
they
have
been
openly
and
confessedly
the
figures
of
vision
now
they
must
come
forward
declare
themselves
and
be
seen
for
what
they
are
and
accordingly
they
do
come
forward
and
are
seen
in
a
famous
passage
rawdon
makes
his
unexpected
return
home
from
prison
and
unfortunate
disaster
overtakes
her
so
to
say
in
our
very
presence
perhaps
i
may
seem
to
exaggerate
the
change
of
method
which
i
note
at
this
point
but
does
it
not
appear
to
any
one
glancing
back
at
his
recollection
of
the
book
that
this
particular
scene
is
defined
and
relieved
and
lighted
differently
somehow
from
the
stream
of
impressions
in
which
it
is
set
a
space
is
cleared
for
it
the
stage
is
swept
this
is
now
no
retrospective
vision
shared
with
thackeray
it
is
a
piece
of
present
action
with
which
we
are
confronted
it
is
strictly
dramatic
and
i
suppose
it
is
good
drama
of
its
kind
but
there
is
more
to
be
said
of
it
than
this
more
to
be
said
even
when
it
has
been
admitted
to
be
drama
of
rather
a
theatrical
strain
the
it
is
probably
agreed
seem
suddenly
to
flare
before
becky
and
rawdon
after
the
clear
daylight
that
reigned
in
thackeray
description
of
them
they
appear
upon
the
scene
as
they
should
but
it
must
be
owned
that
the
scene
has
an
artificial
look
by
comparison
with
the
flowing
spontaneity
of
all
that
has
gone
before
and
this
it
is
exactly
that
shows
how
and
where
thackeray
skill
betrays
him
he
is
not
like
dickens
naturally
inclined
to
the
theatre
the
melodramatic
has
no
fatal
attraction
for
him
so
that
if
he
is
theatrical
here
it
is
not
because
he
inevitably
would
be
given
his
chance
it
is
rather
because
he
must
at
all
costs
make
this
climax
of
his
story
conclusively
and
in
order
to
do
so
he
is
forced
to
use
devices
of
some
crudity
for
him
they
are
crude
because
his
climax
his
à
has
been
insufficiently
prepared
for
becky
rawdon
steyne
in
all
this
matter
that
has
been
leading
up
to
the
scene
have
scarcely
before
been
rendered
in
these
immediate
terms
and
now
that
they
appear
on
their
own
account
they
can
only
make
a
sure
and
pronounced
effect
by
perceptibly
forcing
their
note
a
little
too
much
is
expected
of
them
and
they
must
make
an
unnatural
effort
to
meet
it
my
instance
is
a
small
one
no
doubt
to
be
pressed
so
far
in
lingering
over
these
shades
of
treatment
a
critic
it
may
be
thought
loses
sight
of
the
book
itself
but
i
am
not
trying
of
course
to
criticize
vanity
fair
i
am
looking
for
certain
details
of
method
and
the
small
instance
is
surely
illuminating
it
shows
how
little
thackeray
fashion
of
handling
a
novel
allowed
for
the
big
dramatic
scene
when
at
length
it
had
to
be
faced
how
he
neglected
it
in
advance
how
he
refused
it
till
the
last
possible
moment
it
is
as
though
he
never
quite
trusted
his
men
and
women
when
he
had
to
place
things
entirely
in
their
care
standing
aside
to
let
them
act
he
wanted
to
intervene
continually
he
hesitated
to
leave
them
alone
save
for
a
brief
and
belated
it
was
perverse
of
him
because
the
men
and
women
would
have
acquitted
themselves
so
strikingly
with
a
better
chance
he
gave
them
life
and
vigour
enough
for
much
more
independence
than
they
ever
enjoyed
the
culmination
of
adventure
offered
a
clear
opening
for
full
dramatic
effect
if
he
had
chosen
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
had
steadily
piled
up
his
impression
carefully
brought
all
the
sense
of
the
situation
to
converge
upon
a
single
point
everything
was
ready
for
the
great
scene
of
becky
triumph
in
the
face
of
the
world
one
memorable
night
of
a
party
at
gaunt
house
it
is
incredible
that
he
should
let
the
opportunity
slip
there
was
a
chance
of
a
straight
unhampered
view
of
the
whole
meaning
of
his
matter
nothing
was
needed
but
to
allow
the
scene
to
show
itself
fairly
and
squarely
all
its
force
would
have
been
lent
to
the
disaster
that
follows
the
dismay
the
disillusion
the
snarl
of
anger
and
defiance
all
would
have
been
made
beforehand
by
so
much
would
the
effect
of
the
impending
scene
the
scene
of
catastrophe
have
been
strengthened
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
the
sudden
heightening
of
the
pitch
the
thickening
of
the
colour
the
incongruous
and
theatrical
tone
yet
the
chance
is
missed
the
triumphal
evening
passes
in
a
confused
haze
that
leaves
the
situation
exactly
where
it
was
before
the
episode
is
only
a
repetition
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
has
happened
already
there
are
echoes
of
festive
sound
and
a
rumour
of
brilliance
but
the
significant
look
that
the
actual
facts
might
have
worn
and
must
have
betrayed
the
look
that
by
this
time
thackeray
has
so
fully
instructed
his
reader
to
catch
this
is
not
disclosed
after
all
there
is
still
nothing
here
but
thackeray
amusing
irrepressible
conversation
the
scene
he
can
not
make
up
his
mind
to
clear
a
space
before
it
and
give
the
situation
the
free
field
it
cries
out
for
and
if
it
is
asked
what
kind
of
clarity
i
mean
i
need
only
recall
another
page
close
by
which
shows
it
perfectly
becky
had
made
an
earlier
appearance
at
gaunt
house
she
had
dined
there
near
the
beginning
of
her
social
career
and
had
found
herself
in
a
difficulty
there
came
a
moment
when
she
had
to
face
the
frigid
hostility
of
the
noble
ladies
of
the
party
alone
with
them
in
the
and
her
assurance
failed
in
the
little
scene
that
ensues
the
charming
veil
of
thackeray
talk
is
suddenly
raised
there
is
becky
seated
at
the
piano
lady
steyne
listening
in
a
dream
of
old
memories
the
other
women
chattering
at
a
distance
when
the
jarring
doors
are
thrown
open
and
the
men
return
it
is
all
over
in
half
a
page
but
in
that
glimpse
the
story
is
lifted
forward
dramatically
ocular
proof
as
it
were
is
added
to
thackeray
account
of
doubtful
and
delicate
position
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
i
mention
the
one
moment
in
the
later
episode
the
evening
of
those
strangely
ineffective
charades
at
gaunt
house
which
appears
to
me
to
open
the
same
kind
of
rift
in
the
haze
it
is
a
single
glimpse
of
steyne
applauding
becky
triumph
he
is
immediately
there
an
actor
in
the
show
alive
and
expressive
but
he
is
alone
none
of
the
others
so
emerges
even
becky
is
only
a
luminous
spot
in
the
dimness
as
for
the
relation
of
the
three
steyne
becky
and
her
husband
which
is
on
the
point
of
becoming
so
important
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
of
it
right
and
left
in
the
novels
of
thackeray
one
may
gather
instances
of
the
same
kind
the
piercing
and
momentary
shaft
of
direct
vision
the
big
scene
approached
and
then
refused
it
is
easy
to
find
another
in
vanity
fair
who
but
thackeray
could
have
borne
to
use
the
famous
matter
of
the
waterloo
ball
a
wonderful
gift
for
a
novelist
to
find
in
his
path
only
to
waste
it
to
dissipate
its
effect
to
get
no
real
contribution
from
it
after
all
in
the
queer
haphazard
polyglot
interlude
that
precedes
it
thackeray
is
of
course
entirely
at
home
there
it
is
a
question
of
the
he
delights
in
the
large
impression
of
things
in
general
the
evocation
of
daily
life
brussels
in
its
talkative
suspense
waiting
for
the
sound
of
the
guns
feeding
on
rumour
comes
crowding
into
the
chapter
and
then
the
great
occasion
that
should
have
crowned
it
into
which
the
story
naturally
and
logically
passes
for
again
the
scene
is
not
a
decorative
patch
the
story
needs
it
the
waterloo
ball
is
nothing
leaves
no
image
constitutes
no
effect
whatever
the
reader
looking
back
on
the
book
might
be
quite
uncertain
whether
he
had
been
there
or
not
nobody
could
forget
the
sight
of
lady
bareacres
sitting
under
the
in
her
horseless
carriage
of
good
rising
in
the
dawn
to
equip
her
warrior
for
battle
of
george
osborne
dead
on
the
field
but
these
are
thackeray
flashes
of
revelation
straight
and
sure
and
they
are
all
the
drama
strictly
speaking
that
he
extorts
from
his
material
the
rest
is
picture
stirringly
vivaciously
reflected
in
his
unfailing
memory
with
the
dramatic
occasion
to
which
it
tends
the
historic
affair
of
the
revelry
by
night
neglected
and
lost
there
is
scarcely
need
for
more
illustration
of
my
point
but
it
is
tempting
to
look
further
in
all
these
books
thackeray
in
an
expansive
mood
opens
his
mind
and
talks
it
out
on
the
subject
of
some
big
company
of
men
and
women
he
remembers
as
we
all
remember
with
a
strong
sense
of
the
tone
and
air
of
an
old
experience
and
a
sharp
recollection
of
moments
that
happened
for
some
reason
to
be
salient
significant
peculiarly
keen
or
curious
ethel
newcome
when
she
comes
riding
into
the
garden
in
the
early
morning
full
of
the
news
of
her
wonderful
discovery
the
letter
shut
in
the
old
book
blanche
amory
when
she
is
caught
out
in
her
faithlessness
warbling
to
the
new
swain
at
the
piano
and
whipping
her
handkerchief
over
his
as
the
old
one
enters
madam
esmond
on
her
balcony
defying
the
mob
with
britons
strike
home
old
sir
pitt
toasting
his
rasher
in
the
company
of
the
i
name
them
at
random
they
are
all
instances
of
the
way
in
which
the
glance
of
memory
falls
on
the
particular
moment
the
aspect
that
hardens
and
crystallizes
an
impression
thackeray
has
these
flashes
in
profusion
they
break
out
unforgettably
as
we
think
of
his
books
the
most
exquisite
of
all
perhaps
is
in
esmond
that
sight
of
the
dusky
choir
of
winchester
cathedral
the
shine
of
the
the
clear
faces
of
rachel
and
her
son
as
they
appear
to
the
returned
wanderer
we
no
longer
listen
to
a
story
no
longer
see
the
past
in
a
sympathetic
imagination
this
is
a
higher
power
of
intensity
a
fragment
of
the
past
made
present
and
actual
but
with
thackeray
it
is
always
a
fragment
never
to
any
real
purpose
a
deliberate
and
continuous
enactment
for
continuity
he
always
recurs
to
his
pictorial
summary
the
newcomes
alone
would
give
a
dozen
examples
of
this
side
of
his
genius
in
the
pages
that
recall
the
lean
dignity
of
the
refugees
from
revolutionary
paris
or
the
pious
opulence
of
clapham
or
the
rustle
of
fashion
round
the
mayfair
chapel
or
the
chatter
and
scandal
of
or
the
squalid
pretensions
of
english
life
at
boulogne
i
need
not
lengthen
the
list
these
evocations
follow
one
upon
another
and
as
quickly
as
thackeray
passes
into
a
new
circle
he
makes
us
feel
and
know
what
it
was
like
to
live
there
and
belong
to
it
the
typical
look
of
the
place
is
in
his
mind
the
sense
of
its
habitual
life
the
savour
of
the
hours
that
lapse
there
but
esmond
again
has
the
last
word
the
early
chapters
of
the
old
days
at
castlewood
show
a
subtlety
of
effect
that
is
peculiar
and
rare
it
is
more
than
a
picture
of
a
place
and
an
impression
of
romance
it
is
more
than
the
portrait
of
a
child
besides
all
this
it
is
the
most
masterly
of
if
that
is
a
word
that
will
serve
the
effect
i
am
thinking
of
is
different
from
that
of
which
i
spoke
in
the
matter
of
tolstoy
great
cycles
of
action
there
we
saw
the
march
of
time
recording
itself
affirming
its
ceaseless
movement
in
the
lives
of
certain
people
this
of
thackeray
is
not
like
that
time
at
castlewood
is
not
movement
it
is
tranquillity
time
that
stands
still
as
we
say
only
deepening
as
the
years
go
it
can
not
therefore
be
shown
as
a
sequence
and
thackeray
roams
to
and
fro
in
his
narrative
caring
little
for
the
connected
order
of
events
if
he
can
give
the
sensation
of
time
deep
and
soft
and
abundant
by
delaying
and
returning
at
ease
over
this
tract
of
the
past
it
would
be
possible
i
think
to
say
very
precisely
where
and
how
the
effect
is
made
by
what
leisurely
play
with
the
chronology
of
the
story
apparently
careless
and
unmethodical
or
by
what
shifting
of
the
focus
so
that
the
house
of
castlewood
is
now
a
memory
and
now
a
close
benevolent
presence
time
at
any
rate
is
stored
up
in
the
description
of
the
child
life
there
quiet
layers
of
time
in
which
the
recorded
incidents
sink
deep
viii
in
dealing
with
the
method
that
i
find
peculiarly
characteristic
of
thackeray
the
panoramic
method
i
have
spoken
of
it
also
as
pictorial
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
i
have
thus
arrived
at
another
distinction
which
i
touched
upon
in
connection
with
bovary
picture
and
drama
this
is
an
antithesis
which
continually
appears
in
a
novel
and
i
shall
have
much
to
say
of
it
and
first
of
the
names
which
i
give
to
these
contrasted
manners
of
treatment
i
do
not
know
that
they
are
the
best
names
but
they
express
the
main
point
of
difference
and
they
also
have
this
advantage
that
they
been
used
technically
in
the
criticism
of
fiction
with
specific
meaning
in
writing
about
novels
one
is
so
rarely
handling
words
that
have
ever
been
given
close
definition
with
regard
to
the
art
of
fiction
i
mean
that
it
is
natural
to
grasp
at
any
which
have
chanced
to
be
selected
and
strictly
applied
by
a
critic
of
authority
picture
and
drama
therefore
i
use
because
henry
james
used
them
in
discussing
his
own
novels
when
he
reviewed
them
all
in
his
later
years
but
i
use
them
i
must
add
in
a
rather
more
extended
sense
than
he
did
anybody
who
knows
the
critical
prefaces
of
his
books
will
remember
how
picture
and
drama
to
him
represented
the
twofold
manner
towards
which
he
tended
in
his
last
novels
composed
as
they
are
in
a
regular
alternation
of
dramatic
dialogue
and
pictorial
description
but
pictorial
description
was
of
a
very
special
kind
and
when
the
subject
of
criticism
is
fiction
generally
not
his
alone
picture
will
take
a
wider
meaning
as
opposed
to
drama
it
will
be
found
to
cover
the
panoramic
manner
of
thackeray
it
is
a
question
i
said
of
the
reader
relation
to
the
writer
in
one
case
the
reader
faces
towards
the
and
listens
to
him
in
the
other
he
turns
towards
the
story
and
watches
it
in
the
drama
of
the
stage
in
the
acted
play
the
spectator
evidently
has
no
direct
concern
with
the
author
at
all
while
the
action
is
proceeding
the
author
places
their
parts
in
the
mouths
of
the
players
leaves
them
to
make
their
own
impression
leaves
the
audience
to
make
what
we
can
of
it
the
motion
of
life
is
before
us
the
recording
registering
mind
of
the
author
is
eliminated
that
is
drama
and
when
we
think
of
the
as
opposed
to
the
dramatist
it
is
obvious
that
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
there
is
no
such
thing
as
drama
in
a
novel
the
novelist
may
give
the
very
words
that
were
spoken
by
his
characters
the
dialogue
but
of
course
he
must
interpose
on
his
own
account
to
let
us
know
how
the
people
appeared
and
where
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
if
he
offers
nothing
but
the
bare
dialogue
he
is
writing
a
kind
of
play
just
as
a
dramatist
amplifying
his
play
with
and
putting
it
forth
to
be
read
in
a
book
has
really
written
a
kind
of
novel
but
the
difference
between
the
and
the
playwright
is
not
my
affair
and
a
new
contrast
within
the
limits
of
the
art
of
fiction
is
apparent
when
we
speak
of
the
novel
by
itself
a
contrast
of
two
methods
to
one
of
which
it
is
reasonable
to
give
the
name
of
drama
i
do
not
say
that
a
clear
line
can
be
drawn
between
them
criticism
does
not
hope
to
be
mathematically
exact
but
everybody
sees
the
diversity
between
the
talkative
confidential
manner
of
thackeray
and
the
severe
discreet
anonymous
manner
of
whom
shall
i
say
of
maupassant
for
a
good
example
in
many
of
his
stories
it
is
not
only
the
difference
between
the
personal
qualities
of
the
two
men
which
indeed
are
also
as
far
apart
as
the
house
of
castlewood
and
the
maison
tellier
it
is
not
the
difference
between
the
kinds
of
story
they
chose
to
tell
they
approached
a
story
from
opposite
sides
and
thought
of
it
consequently
in
images
that
had
nothing
in
common
not
always
i
dare
say
but
on
the
whole
and
characteristically
they
did
so
maupassant
idea
of
a
story
and
not
peculiarly
maupassant
of
course
but
his
name
is
convenient
would
suggest
an
object
that
you
fashioned
and
abandoned
to
the
reader
turning
away
and
leaving
him
alone
with
it
thackeray
would
be
more
like
the
idea
of
a
long
and
sociable
interview
with
the
reader
a
companion
with
whom
he
must
establish
definite
terms
enough
the
contrast
is
very
familiar
but
these
are
images
how
is
the
difference
shown
in
their
written
books
in
esmond
and
la
maison
tellier
both
it
is
true
represent
a
picture
that
was
in
the
author
mind
but
the
story
passes
into
book
as
a
picture
still
and
passes
into
maupassant
as
something
else
i
call
it
drama
in
maupassant
drama
we
are
close
to
the
facts
against
them
and
amongst
them
he
relates
his
story
as
though
he
had
caught
it
in
the
act
and
were
mentioning
the
details
as
they
passed
there
seems
to
be
no
particular
process
at
work
in
his
mind
so
little
that
the
figure
of
maupassant
the
showman
is
overlooked
and
forgotten
as
we
follow
the
direction
of
his
eyes
the
scene
he
evokes
is
contemporaneous
and
there
it
is
we
can
see
it
as
well
as
he
can
certainly
he
is
telling
us
things
but
they
are
things
so
immediate
so
perceptible
that
the
machinery
of
his
telling
by
which
they
reach
us
is
unnoticed
the
story
appears
to
tell
itself
critically
of
course
we
know
how
far
that
is
from
being
the
case
we
know
with
what
judicious
thought
the
showman
is
selecting
the
points
of
the
scene
upon
which
he
touches
but
the
is
that
he
is
not
there
at
all
because
he
is
doing
nothing
that
ostensibly
requires
any
judgement
nothing
that
reminds
us
of
his
presence
he
is
behind
us
out
of
sight
out
of
mind
the
story
occupies
us
the
moving
scene
and
nothing
else
but
thackeray
in
story
we
need
him
all
the
time
and
can
never
forget
him
he
it
is
who
must
assemble
and
arrange
his
large
chronicle
piecing
it
together
out
of
his
experience
becky
mode
of
life
in
his
story
is
a
matter
of
many
details
picked
up
on
many
occasions
and
the
power
that
collects
them
the
mind
that
contains
them
is
always
and
openly
thackeray
it
could
not
be
otherwise
it
is
no
question
for
most
of
the
time
of
watching
a
scene
at
close
quarters
where
the
simple
literal
detail
such
as
anybody
might
see
for
himself
would
be
sufficient
a
stretch
of
time
is
to
be
shown
in
perspective
at
a
distance
the
must
be
at
hand
to
work
it
into
a
single
impression
and
thus
the
general
panorama
such
as
thackeray
displays
becomes
the
representation
of
the
experience
and
the
author
becomes
a
personal
entity
about
whom
we
may
begin
to
ask
questions
thackeray
be
the
nameless
abstraction
that
the
dramatist
whether
in
the
drama
of
the
stage
or
in
that
of
the
novel
is
naturally
i
know
that
thackeray
so
far
from
trying
to
conceal
himself
comes
forward
and
attracts
attention
and
nudges
the
reader
a
great
deal
more
than
he
need
he
likes
the
personal
relation
with
the
reader
and
insists
on
it
but
do
what
he
might
to
disguise
it
so
long
as
he
is
ranging
over
his
story
at
a
height
chronicling
summarizing
foreshortening
he
be
present
to
the
reader
as
a
narrator
and
a
showman
it
is
only
when
he
descends
and
approaches
a
certain
occasion
and
sets
a
scene
with
due
circumspection
rarely
and
a
trifle
awkwardly
as
we
saw
that
he
can
for
the
time
being
efface
the
thought
of
his
active
part
in
the
affair
so
much
of
a
novel
therefore
as
is
not
dramatic
enactment
not
inclines
always
to
picture
to
the
reflection
of
mind
confronted
with
a
scene
like
becky
great
scene
once
more
we
forget
that
other
mind
but
as
soon
as
the
story
goes
off
again
into
narrative
a
question
at
once
arises
is
disposing
the
scattered
facts
whose
is
this
new
point
of
view
it
is
the
omniscient
author
and
the
point
of
view
is
his
such
would
be
the
common
answer
and
it
is
the
answer
we
get
in
vanity
fair
by
convention
the
author
is
allowed
his
universal
knowledge
of
the
story
and
the
people
in
it
but
still
it
is
a
convention
and
a
prudent
novelist
does
not
strain
it
unnecessarily
thackeray
in
vanity
fair
is
not
at
all
prudent
his
method
so
seldom
strictly
dramatic
is
one
that
of
its
nature
is
apt
to
force
this
question
of
the
narrator
authority
and
he
goes
out
of
his
way
to
emphasize
the
question
still
further
he
flourishes
the
fact
that
the
point
of
view
is
his
own
not
to
be
confounded
with
that
of
anybody
in
the
book
and
so
his
book
as
one
may
say
is
not
complete
in
itself
not
really
it
does
not
meet
and
satisfy
all
the
issues
it
suggests
over
the
whole
of
one
side
of
it
there
is
an
inconclusive
look
something
that
draws
the
eye
away
from
the
book
itself
into
space
it
is
the
question
of
the
relation
to
the
story
however
unconsciously
and
i
dare
say
the
recognition
is
usually
unconscious
the
novelist
is
alive
to
this
difficulty
no
doubt
for
we
may
see
him
we
presently
shall
taking
various
steps
to
circumvent
it
there
is
felt
to
be
an
unsatisfactory
want
of
finish
in
leaving
a
question
hanging
out
of
the
book
like
a
loose
end
without
some
kind
of
attempt
to
pull
it
back
and
make
it
part
of
an
integral
design
after
all
the
book
is
torn
away
from
its
author
and
given
out
to
the
world
the
author
is
no
longer
a
wandering
who
enters
the
hall
and
utters
his
book
to
the
company
assembled
retaining
his
book
as
his
own
inalienable
possession
himself
and
his
actual
presence
and
his
real
voice
indivisibly
a
part
of
it
the
book
that
we
read
has
no
such
support
it
must
bring
its
own
recognisances
and
in
the
fictitious
picture
of
life
the
effect
of
validity
is
all
in
all
and
there
can
be
no
appeal
to
an
external
authority
and
so
there
is
an
inherent
weakness
in
it
if
the
mind
that
knows
the
story
and
the
eye
that
sees
it
remain
unaccountable
at
any
moment
they
may
be
questioned
and
the
only
way
to
silence
the
question
is
somehow
to
make
the
mind
and
the
eye
objective
to
make
them
facts
in
the
story
when
the
point
of
view
is
definitely
included
in
the
book
when
it
can
be
recognized
and
verified
there
then
every
side
of
the
book
is
equally
wrought
and
fashioned
otherwise
it
may
seem
like
a
thing
meant
to
stand
against
a
wall
with
one
side
left
in
the
rough
and
there
is
no
wall
for
a
novel
to
stand
against
that
this
is
not
a
fanciful
objection
to
a
pictorial
book
like
vanity
fair
where
the
point
of
view
is
accounted
for
is
proved
i
think
by
the
different
means
that
a
novelist
will
adopt
to
authenticate
his
story
to
dramatize
the
seeing
eye
as
i
should
prefer
to
put
it
these
i
shall
try
to
deal
with
in
what
seems
to
be
their
logical
order
illuminating
examples
of
any
of
them
are
not
wanting
i
do
not
suggest
that
if
i
were
criticizing
vanity
fair
i
should
think
twice
about
this
aspect
of
it
to
do
so
would
be
very
futile
criticism
of
such
a
book
such
a
store
of
life
but
then
i
am
not
considering
it
as
vanity
fair
i
am
considering
it
as
a
dominant
case
of
pictorial
fiction
and
here
is
the
characteristic
danger
of
the
method
and
a
danger
which
all
who
practise
the
method
are
not
likely
to
encounter
and
with
the
genius
of
thackeray
and
even
thackeray
he
chose
to
encounter
it
once
again
it
is
true
in
pendennis
but
only
once
and
no
more
and
after
that
he
took
his
own
precautions
and
evidently
found
that
he
could
move
the
more
freely
for
doing
so
but
to
revert
yet
again
for
a
moment
to
bovary
which
seemed
on
scrutiny
to
be
more
of
a
picture
than
a
drama
i
think
it
is
clear
how
flaubert
avoided
the
necessity
of
installing
himself
avowedly
as
the
narrator
in
the
sight
of
the
reader
i
mentioned
how
he
constantly
blends
his
acuter
vision
with
that
of
emma
so
that
the
weakness
of
her
gift
of
experience
is
helped
out
and
the
help
is
mutual
for
on
the
other
hand
her
vision
is
always
active
as
far
as
it
goes
and
flaubert
intervention
is
so
unobtrusive
that
her
point
of
view
seems
to
govern
the
story
more
than
it
does
really
and
therefore
though
the
book
is
largely
a
picture
a
review
of
many
details
and
occasions
the
question
of
the
narrator
is
never
insistent
the
landscape
that
thackeray
controls
is
so
much
wider
and
fuller
that
even
with
all
the
tact
of
flaubert
and
little
he
has
of
it
he
could
scarcely
follow
flaubert
example
his
book
is
not
a
portrait
of
character
but
a
panorama
of
manners
and
there
is
no
disguising
the
need
of
some
detached
spectator
who
looks
on
from
without
it
is
the
method
of
that
enables
the
novelist
to
cover
his
great
spaces
of
life
and
quantities
of
experience
so
much
greater
than
any
that
can
be
brought
within
the
acts
of
a
play
as
for
intensity
of
life
that
is
another
matter
there
as
we
have
seen
the
novelist
has
recourse
to
his
other
arm
the
one
that
corresponds
with
the
single
arm
of
the
dramatist
inevitably
as
the
plot
thickens
and
the
climax
approaches
inevitably
wherever
an
impression
is
to
be
emphasized
and
driven
home
narration
gives
place
to
enactment
the
train
of
events
to
the
particular
episode
the
broad
picture
to
the
dramatic
scene
but
the
limitation
of
drama
is
as
obvious
as
its
peculiar
power
it
is
clear
that
if
we
wish
to
see
an
abundance
and
multitude
of
life
we
shall
find
it
more
readily
and
more
summarily
by
looking
for
an
hour
into
a
memory
a
consciousness
than
by
merely
watching
the
present
events
of
an
hour
however
crowded
much
may
happen
in
that
time
but
in
extent
it
will
be
nothing
to
the
regions
thrown
open
by
the
other
method
a
novelist
with
a
large
and
discursive
subject
before
him
could
not
hope
to
show
it
all
dramatically
much
of
it
perhaps
the
greater
part
must
be
so
marshalled
that
it
may
be
swept
by
a
travelling
glance
thackeray
shows
how
it
is
done
and
how
a
vista
of
many
facts
can
be
made
to
fall
into
line
but
he
shows
too
how
it
needs
a
mind
to
create
that
vista
and
how
the
creative
mind
becomes
more
and
more
perceptible
more
visibly
active
as
the
prospect
widens
most
novelists
i
think
seem
to
betray
like
thackeray
a
preference
for
one
method
or
the
other
for
picture
or
for
drama
one
sees
in
a
moment
how
fielding
balzac
george
eliot
incline
to
the
first
in
their
diverse
manners
and
tolstoy
certainly
tolstoy
in
spite
of
his
big
range
or
dostoevsky
to
the
second
the
scenic
way
but
of
course
every
novelist
uses
both
and
the
quality
of
a
novelist
appears
very
clearly
in
his
management
of
the
two
how
he
guides
the
story
into
the
scene
how
he
picks
it
out
of
the
scene
a
richer
and
fuller
story
than
it
was
before
and
proceeds
with
his
narrative
on
the
whole
no
doubt
the
possibilities
of
the
scene
are
greatly
abused
in
fiction
in
the
daily
and
familiar
novel
they
are
doubly
abused
for
the
treatment
of
the
scene
is
neglected
and
yet
it
recurs
again
and
again
much
too
often
and
its
value
is
wasted
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
drama
is
the
novelist
highest
light
like
the
white
paper
or
white
paint
of
a
draughtsman
to
use
it
prodigally
where
it
is
not
needed
is
to
lessen
its
force
where
it
is
essential
and
so
the
economical
procedure
would
be
to
hoard
it
rather
reserving
it
for
important
occasions
as
in
bovary
sure
enough
but
before
i
deal
with
the
question
of
the
novelist
drama
i
would
follow
out
the
whole
argument
that
is
suggested
by
his
reflected
picture
of
life
this
after
all
is
the
method
which
is
his
very
own
which
he
commands
as
a
pure
and
simple
and
for
a
beginning
i
have
tried
to
indicate
its
prime
disadvantage
consisting
of
the
fact
that
in
its
plain
form
it
drags
in
the
omniscient
author
and
may
make
him
exceedingly
conspicuous
why
is
this
a
disadvantage
is
it
asked
it
is
none
of
course
if
the
author
has
the
power
to
make
us
admire
and
welcome
the
apparition
or
if
his
picture
is
so
dazzling
that
a
theoretic
defect
in
it
is
forgotten
but
a
novel
in
which
either
of
these
feats
is
accomplished
proves
only
the
charm
or
genius
of
the
author
charm
and
genius
do
what
they
will
there
is
nothing
new
in
that
and
i
believe
that
the
defect
even
though
at
first
sight
it
may
seem
a
trifle
is
apt
to
become
more
and
more
troublesome
in
a
book
as
the
book
is
it
makes
for
a
kind
of
thinness
in
the
general
impression
wherever
the
personal
force
of
the
writer
is
not
remarkable
i
should
say
that
it
may
often
contribute
towards
an
air
of
ineffectiveness
in
a
story
which
it
might
otherwise
be
difficult
to
explain
the
fiction
of
turgenev
is
on
the
whole
a
case
in
point
to
my
mind
turgenev
was
never
shy
of
appearing
in
his
pages
as
the
reflective
imparting
the
fruits
of
his
observation
to
the
reader
he
will
watch
a
character
let
us
say
cross
a
field
and
enter
a
wood
and
sit
down
under
a
tree
good
it
is
an
opportunity
for
gaining
a
first
impression
of
the
man
or
woman
it
is
a
little
scene
and
turgenev
touch
is
quick
and
light
but
then
with
perfect
candour
he
will
show
his
hand
he
will
draw
the
reader
aside
and
pour
into
his
ear
a
flow
of
information
about
the
man
or
woman
information
that
openly
comes
straight
from
turgenev
himself
in
good
pictorial
form
no
doubt
but
information
which
will
never
have
its
due
weight
with
the
reader
because
it
reposes
upon
nothing
that
he
can
test
for
himself
who
and
what
is
this
communicative
participator
in
the
business
this
vocal
author
he
does
not
belong
to
the
book
and
his
voice
has
not
that
compelling
tone
and
tune
of
its
own
as
had
which
makes
a
reader
enjoy
hearing
it
for
its
own
sake
this
is
a
small
matter
i
admit
but
turgenev
extends
it
and
pursues
the
same
kind
of
course
in
more
important
affairs
he
remains
the
observant
narrator
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
a
share
in
his
experience
the
result
is
surely
that
his
picture
of
life
has
less
authority
than
its
highly
finished
design
would
seem
to
warrant
it
is
evidently
not
a
picture
in
which
the
deeps
of
character
are
sounded
and
in
which
the
heights
of
passion
are
touched
and
in
which
a
great
breadth
of
the
human
world
is
contained
it
is
not
a
picture
of
such
dimensions
but
it
has
so
much
neat
and
just
and
even
exquisite
work
in
it
that
it
might
seem
final
of
its
kind
completely
effective
in
what
it
attempts
and
it
falls
short
of
this
i
should
say
and
there
is
something
in
that
constant
sense
of
turgenev
at
one
elbow
the
little
picture
that
may
very
well
damage
it
the
thing
ought
to
stand
out
by
itself
it
could
easily
be
made
to
do
so
but
turgenev
was
unsuspecting
he
had
not
taken
to
heart
the
full
importance
of
dramatizing
the
point
of
view
perhaps
it
was
that
the
narrative
then
the
chronicle
the
summary
which
must
represent
the
ordered
and
arranged
experience
and
which
must
accordingly
be
of
the
nature
of
a
picture
is
to
be
strengthened
is
to
be
raised
to
a
power
approaching
that
of
drama
where
the
intervention
of
the
is
no
longer
felt
the
freedom
which
the
pictorial
method
gives
to
the
novelist
is
unknown
to
the
playwright
but
that
freedom
has
to
be
paid
for
by
some
loss
of
intensity
and
the
question
is
how
to
pay
as
little
as
possible
in
the
end
as
i
think
it
may
be
shown
the
loss
is
made
good
and
there
is
nothing
to
pay
at
all
so
far
may
the
dramatizing
process
be
followed
method
i
have
said
can
be
imposed
upon
method
one
kind
upon
another
and
in
analyzing
the
manner
of
certain
novelists
one
discovers
how
ingeniously
they
will
correct
the
weakness
of
one
method
by
the
force
of
another
and
retain
the
advantages
of
both
it
is
rather
a
complicated
story
but
the
beginning
is
clear
enough
and
the
direction
which
it
is
to
take
is
also
clear
everything
in
the
novel
not
only
the
scenic
episodes
but
all
the
rest
is
to
be
in
some
sense
dramatized
that
is
where
the
argument
tends
as
for
the
beginning
of
it
the
first
obvious
step
the
example
of
thackeray
is
at
hand
and
it
could
not
be
bettered
i
turn
to
esmond
ix
the
novelist
i
am
supposing
is
faced
with
a
situation
in
his
story
where
for
some
good
reason
more
is
needed
than
the
simple
impression
which
the
reader
might
have
formed
for
himself
had
he
been
present
and
using
his
eyes
on
the
spot
it
is
a
case
for
a
general
account
of
many
things
or
it
is
a
case
for
a
certain
view
of
the
facts
based
on
inner
knowledge
to
be
presented
to
the
reader
thackeray
for
example
has
to
open
his
mind
on
the
subject
of
becky
ambitions
or
amelia
regrets
it
would
take
too
long
perhaps
it
would
be
impossible
to
set
them
acting
their
emotions
in
a
form
that
would
tell
the
reader
the
whole
tale
their
creator
must
elucidate
the
matter
he
can
not
forget
however
that
this
report
of
their
emotions
is
a
subjective
affair
of
his
own
it
relies
upon
his
memory
of
becky
or
amelia
plight
his
insight
into
the
workings
of
their
thought
his
sense
of
past
action
all
this
is
vivid
enough
to
the
author
who
has
seen
and
known
but
the
reader
stands
at
a
further
remove
it
would
be
different
if
this
consciousness
of
the
past
the
mind
which
holds
the
memory
should
itself
become
for
the
reader
a
directly
perceptible
fact
the
author
must
supply
his
view
but
he
might
treat
his
view
as
though
it
were
in
its
turn
a
piece
of
action
it
a
piece
of
action
or
of
activity
when
he
calls
up
these
old
recollections
and
why
should
not
that
effort
be
given
the
value
of
a
sort
of
drama
on
its
own
account
it
would
then
be
like
a
play
within
a
play
the
outer
framework
at
least
consisting
of
the
reflective
mind
would
be
immediately
in
front
of
the
reader
and
its
relation
to
the
thing
framed
the
projected
vision
would
explain
itself
so
long
as
the
recorder
stands
outside
and
away
from
his
book
as
thackeray
stands
outside
vanity
fair
a
potential
value
is
wasted
the
activity
that
is
proceeding
in
his
mind
is
not
in
itself
an
element
in
the
effect
of
the
book
as
it
might
be
and
if
it
were
thus
drawn
into
the
book
it
would
do
double
duty
it
would
authenticate
and
so
enhance
the
picture
it
would
add
a
new
and
independent
interest
as
well
it
seems
that
there
is
everything
to
be
said
for
making
a
drama
of
the
narrator
himself
and
so
thackeray
evidently
felt
for
in
all
his
later
work
he
refused
to
remain
the
unaccountable
seer
from
without
he
did
not
carry
the
dramatizing
process
very
far
indeed
and
it
may
be
thought
that
the
change
in
his
method
does
not
amount
to
much
in
the
newcomes
and
its
successors
the
old
thackerayan
display
seems
essentially
the
same
as
ever
still
the
familiar
intimate
outpouring
with
all
the
inflexions
of
thackeray
voice
and
the
humours
of
his
temperament
certainly
pendennis
and
esmond
and
george
warrington
and
thackeray
have
all
of
them
exactly
the
same
conception
of
the
art
of
they
all
command
the
same
perfection
of
luminous
style
and
not
only
does
thackeray
stop
short
at
an
early
stage
of
the
process
i
am
considering
but
it
must
be
owned
that
he
uses
the
device
of
the
narrator
in
character
very
loosely
and
casually
as
soon
as
it
might
be
troublesome
to
use
it
with
care
but
still
he
takes
the
step
and
he
picks
up
the
loose
end
i
spoke
of
and
he
packs
it
into
his
book
and
thenceforward
we
see
precisely
how
the
narrator
stands
towards
the
story
he
unfolds
it
is
the
first
step
in
the
dramatization
of
picture
a
very
simple
and
obvious
step
too
it
will
be
said
the
natural
device
of
the
for
giving
his
tale
a
look
of
truth
it
is
so
indeed
but
the
interest
of
the
matter
lies
in
recognizing
exactly
what
it
is
that
is
gained
what
it
is
that
makes
that
look
esmond
tells
the
story
quite
as
thackeray
would
it
all
comes
streaming
out
as
a
pictorial
evocation
of
old
times
there
is
just
as
little
that
is
strictly
dramatic
in
it
as
there
is
in
vanity
fair
rarely
very
rarely
indeed
is
there
anything
that
could
be
called
a
scene
there
is
a
long
impression
that
creeps
forward
and
forward
as
esmond
retraces
his
life
with
those
piercing
moments
of
vision
which
we
remember
so
well
but
to
the
other
people
in
the
book
it
makes
all
the
difference
that
the
narrator
is
among
them
now
when
beatrix
appears
we
know
who
it
is
that
so
sees
her
and
we
know
where
the
seer
is
placed
his
line
of
sight
striking
across
the
book
from
him
the
seer
to
her
the
seen
is
measurable
its
angle
is
shown
it
gives
to
beatrix
a
new
dimension
and
a
sharper
relief
can
you
remember
any
moment
in
vanity
fair
when
you
beheld
becky
as
again
and
again
you
behold
beatrix
catching
the
very
slant
of
the
light
on
her
face
becky
never
suddenly
flowered
out
against
her
background
in
that
way
some
want
of
solidity
and
of
objectivity
there
still
is
in
becky
and
there
must
be
because
she
is
regarded
from
anywhere
from
nowhere
from
somewhere
in
the
surrounding
void
thackeray
language
about
her
does
not
carry
the
same
weight
as
esmond
about
beatrix
because
nobody
knows
where
thackeray
is
or
what
his
relation
may
be
to
becky
this
then
is
the
readiest
means
of
dramatically
heightening
a
reported
impression
this
device
of
telling
the
story
in
the
first
person
in
the
person
of
somebody
in
the
book
and
large
in
our
fiction
the
first
person
accordingly
bulks
the
characterized
i
is
substituted
for
the
loose
and
general
i
of
the
author
the
loss
of
freedom
is
more
than
repaid
by
the
more
salient
effect
of
the
picture
precision
individuality
is
given
to
it
by
this
pair
of
eyes
known
and
named
through
which
the
reader
sees
it
instead
of
drifting
in
space
above
the
spectacle
he
keeps
his
allotted
station
and
contemplates
a
delimited
field
of
vision
there
is
much
benefit
in
the
sense
that
the
picture
has
now
a
definite
edge
its
value
is
brought
out
to
the
best
advantage
when
its
bounding
line
is
thus
emphasized
moreover
it
is
not
only
the
field
of
vision
that
is
determined
by
the
use
of
the
first
person
it
is
also
the
quality
of
the
tone
when
we
are
shown
what
esmond
sees
and
nothing
else
there
is
first
of
all
the
comfortable
assurance
of
the
point
of
view
and
then
there
is
the
personal
colour
which
he
throws
over
his
account
so
that
it
gains
another
kind
of
distinction
it
does
not
matter
that
esmond
tone
in
his
story
is
remarkably
like
thackeray
in
the
stories
that
tells
in
esmond
case
the
tone
has
a
meaning
in
the
story
is
part
of
it
whereas
in
the
other
case
it
is
related
only
to
thackeray
and
thackeray
is
in
the
void
when
esmond
ruminates
and
reflects
his
manner
is
the
expression
of
a
human
being
there
present
to
whom
it
can
be
referred
when
thackeray
does
the
same
there
is
no
such
compactness
and
the
manner
trails
away
where
we
can
not
follow
it
dramatically
it
seems
clear
that
the
method
of
esmond
has
the
advantage
over
the
method
of
vanity
fair
here
are
sound
reasons
so
far
as
they
go
for
the
use
of
the
first
person
in
the
distinctively
pictorial
book
david
copperfield
for
instance
it
is
essentially
a
long
glance
working
steadily
over
a
tract
of
years
alone
of
its
kind
in
dickens
fiction
it
was
the
one
book
in
which
he
rejected
the
intrigue
of
action
for
the
centre
of
his
design
did
not
reject
it
altogether
indeed
but
accepted
it
as
incidental
only
always
elsewhere
it
is
his
chosen
intrigue
his
plot
that
makes
the
shape
of
his
book
beginning
with
a
deceptive
air
of
intending
mainly
a
novel
of
manners
and
humours
as
stevenson
once
pointed
out
in
bleak
house
or
in
little
dorrit
or
in
our
mutual
friend
in
his
later
books
generally
he
insinuates
a
thread
of
action
that
gradually
twists
more
and
more
of
the
matter
of
the
book
round
itself
the
intrigue
begins
to
take
the
first
place
to
dominate
and
at
last
to
fill
the
pages
that
was
the
form
interesting
of
its
kind
and
one
to
which
justice
has
hardly
been
done
which
he
elaborated
and
made
his
own
in
copperfield
for
once
he
took
another
way
entirely
it
is
the
far
stretch
of
the
past
which
makes
the
shape
of
that
book
not
any
of
the
knots
or
networks
of
action
which
it
contains
these
instead
of
controlling
the
novel
sink
into
the
level
of
retrospect
copperfield
has
not
a
few
lesser
dramas
to
represent
but
the
affair
of
steerforth
the
affair
of
uriah
heep
to
name
a
pair
of
them
which
might
have
developed
and
taken
command
of
the
scene
fall
back
into
the
general
picture
becoming
incidents
in
the
long
rhythm
of
copperfield
memory
it
was
a
clear
case
for
narration
in
person
in
character
everything
was
gained
and
nothing
lost
by
leaving
it
to
the
man
to
give
his
own
impression
nothing
was
lost
because
the
sole
need
is
for
the
reader
to
see
what
david
sees
it
matters
little
how
his
mind
works
or
what
the
effect
of
it
all
may
be
upon
himself
it
is
the
story
of
what
happened
around
him
not
within
david
offers
a
pair
of
eyes
and
a
memory
nothing
further
is
demanded
of
him
but
now
let
me
take
the
case
of
another
big
novel
where
again
there
is
a
picture
outspread
with
episodes
of
drama
that
are
subordinate
to
the
sweep
of
the
expanse
it
is
meredith
story
of
harry
richmond
a
book
in
which
its
author
evidently
found
a
demand
in
some
way
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
his
work
for
here
again
the
first
person
is
used
by
a
man
who
habitually
avoided
it
in
harry
richmond
it
seemed
to
meredith
appropriate
i
suppose
because
the
story
has
a
romantic
and
heroic
temper
the
kind
of
chivalrous
fling
that
sits
well
on
a
youth
of
spirit
telling
his
own
tale
it
is
natural
for
the
youth
to
pass
easily
from
one
adventure
to
the
next
taking
it
as
it
comes
and
if
meredith
proposes
to
write
a
story
of
loose
generous
informal
design
he
had
better
place
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
adventurer
true
that
in
so
far
as
it
is
romantic
and
a
story
of
youth
and
a
story
in
which
an
air
from
an
age
of
blows
into
modern
times
so
that
something
like
a
clash
of
armour
and
a
splintering
of
spears
seems
to
mingle
with
the
noises
of
modern
life
true
that
in
so
far
as
it
is
all
this
harry
richmond
is
not
alone
among
books
the
author
of
richard
feverel
and
evan
harrington
and
beauchamp
and
lord
ormont
was
generally
a
little
vague
on
the
question
of
the
century
in
which
his
stories
were
cast
the
events
may
happen
in
the
nineteenth
century
they
clearly
must
and
yet
the
furniture
and
the
machinery
and
the
conventions
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
a
way
of
appearing
in
meredith
pages
as
if
they
were
anachronisms
but
that
is
by
the
way
harry
richmond
is
certainly
on
the
face
of
it
a
series
of
adventures
loosely
connected
connected
only
by
the
fact
that
they
befell
a
particular
young
man
and
so
the
method
of
narration
should
emphasize
the
link
meredith
may
have
concluded
and
the
young
man
shall
speak
for
himself
the
use
of
the
first
person
no
doubt
is
a
source
of
relief
to
a
novelist
in
the
matter
of
composition
it
composes
of
its
own
accord
or
so
he
may
feel
for
the
hero
gives
the
story
an
indefeasible
unity
by
the
mere
act
of
telling
it
his
career
may
not
seem
to
hang
together
logically
artistically
but
every
part
of
it
is
at
least
united
with
every
part
by
the
coincidence
of
its
all
belonging
to
one
man
when
he
tells
it
himself
that
fact
is
serviceably
to
the
fore
the
first
person
will
draw
a
rambling
fragmentary
tale
together
and
stamp
it
after
a
fashion
as
a
single
whole
does
anybody
dare
to
suggest
that
this
is
a
reason
for
the
marked
popularity
of
the
method
among
our
novelists
autobiography
it
is
a
regular
literary
form
and
yet
it
is
one
which
refuses
the
recognized
principles
of
literary
form
its
natural
right
is
to
seem
wayward
and
inconsequent
its
charm
is
in
the
fidelity
with
which
it
follows
the
winding
course
of
the
writer
thought
as
he
muses
upon
the
past
and
the
writer
is
not
expected
to
guide
his
thought
in
an
orderly
design
but
to
let
it
wander
free
formlessness
becomes
actually
the
mark
of
right
form
in
literature
of
this
class
and
a
novel
presented
as
fictitious
autobiography
gets
the
same
advantage
and
there
the
argument
brings
us
back
to
the
old
question
fiction
must
true
and
there
is
no
look
of
truth
in
inconsequence
and
there
is
no
authority
at
the
back
of
a
novel
independent
of
it
to
vouch
for
the
truth
of
its
apparent
wilfulness
but
it
is
not
worth
while
to
linger
here
the
use
of
the
first
person
has
other
and
more
interesting
snares
than
this
that
it
pretends
to
disguise
unmeaning
inexpressive
form
in
a
story
now
with
regard
to
harry
richmond
ostensibly
it
rather
like
a
chronicle
of
romantic
adventure
not
formless
far
from
it
but
freely
flowing
as
a
saga
with
its
illegitimate
dash
of
and
its
roaring
old
english
and
its
speaking
statue
and
its
quest
of
the
princess
it
a
saga
and
even
an
exceedingly
fantastic
one
but
harry
richmond
is
a
deeply
compacted
book
and
mixed
with
its
romance
there
is
a
novel
of
another
sort
for
the
fantasy
it
is
only
necessary
that
harry
himself
should
give
a
picture
of
his
experience
of
all
that
he
has
seen
and
done
on
this
side
the
story
is
in
the
succession
of
rare
strange
poetic
events
with
the
remarkable
people
concerned
in
them
but
the
aim
of
the
book
goes
far
beyond
this
it
is
to
give
the
portrait
of
harry
richmond
and
that
is
the
real
reason
why
the
story
is
told
all
these
striking
episodes
which
harry
is
so
well
placed
to
describe
are
not
merely
pictures
that
pass
a
story
that
meredith
sets
him
to
tell
because
it
is
of
high
interest
on
its
own
account
meredith
purpose
is
that
the
hero
himself
shall
be
in
the
middle
of
the
book
with
all
the
interest
of
the
story
reflected
back
upon
his
character
his
temper
his
growth
the
subject
is
harry
richmond
a
youth
of
spirit
the
subject
is
the
cycle
of
romance
through
which
he
happens
to
have
passed
in
the
case
of
copperfield
to
go
back
to
him
dickens
had
exactly
the
opposite
intention
he
found
his
book
in
the
expanse
of
life
which
his
david
had
travelled
over
dickens
only
care
was
to
represent
the
wonderful
show
that
filled
his
hero
memory
the
whole
phantasmagoria
is
the
subject
of
the
book
a
hundred
men
and
women
populating
david
past
and
keeping
his
pen
at
full
speed
in
the
effort
to
portray
them
alone
among
the
assembly
david
himself
is
scarcely
of
the
subject
at
all
he
has
substance
enough
and
amply
to
be
a
credible
authoritative
reporter
dickens
sees
well
to
that
but
he
is
a
shadow
compared
with
betsy
trotwood
and
the
micawbers
and
the
heeps
with
all
the
hundred
of
them
and
there
is
no
call
for
him
to
be
more
in
this
respect
his
story
again
is
contrasted
with
that
of
pendennis
which
is
or
is
evidently
meant
to
be
in
the
first
place
a
portrait
of
the
young
man
or
with
the
story
of
tom
jones
perhaps
though
in
this
case
more
doubtfully
for
fielding
shrewd
eye
was
apt
to
be
drawn
away
from
the
young
man
to
the
bustle
of
life
around
him
but
in
copperfield
the
design
is
very
plain
and
is
consistently
pursued
it
would
be
a
false
patch
in
the
story
if
at
any
point
david
attracted
more
attention
to
himself
than
to
the
people
of
his
vision
he
himself
as
a
child
being
of
course
one
of
them
a
little
creature
that
he
sees
in
the
distance
but
he
himself
in
later
years
becoming
merely
the
mirror
of
his
experience
which
he
not
unnaturally
considers
worthy
of
being
pictured
for
its
own
sake
look
back
then
at
harry
richmond
and
it
is
obvious
that
harry
himself
is
all
the
subject
of
the
book
there
is
no
other
his
father
and
his
grandfather
ottilia
and
janet
belong
to
the
book
by
reason
of
him
they
stand
about
him
conditions
of
his
life
phases
of
his
career
determining
what
he
is
and
what
he
becomes
that
is
clearly
thought
in
undertaking
this
chronicle
he
proposes
to
show
how
it
makes
the
history
the
moral
and
emotional
history
of
the
man
through
whom
it
is
uttered
harry
adventures
ambitions
mistakes
successes
are
the
gradual
and
elaborate
expression
of
him
complete
in
the
end
they
round
him
into
the
figure
of
the
man
in
whom
meredith
saw
his
book
the
book
started
from
harry
richmond
the
rest
of
it
is
there
to
display
him
a
youth
of
considerable
parts
and
attractions
and
a
youth
characteristic
of
his
time
and
country
and
a
youth
whose
circumstances
are
such
as
to
give
him
very
free
play
and
to
test
and
prove
him
very
effectually
there
is
the
burden
of
meredith
saga
as
i
call
it
and
he
never
forgets
it
though
sometimes
he
certainly
pushes
the
brilliant
fantasy
of
the
saga
beyond
his
strict
needs
the
romance
of
the
for
instance
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
the
book
honestly
requires
the
high
colour
of
that
infusion
and
all
the
pervading
thrill
that
meredith
gets
from
it
richmond
roy
is
largely
gratuitous
a
piece
of
indulgence
on
meredith
part
but
that
objection
is
not
likely
to
be
pressed
very
severely
and
anyhow
harry
is
firmly
established
in
the
forefront
he
tells
his
story
he
describes
the
company
and
the
scenes
he
has
lived
through
and
all
the
time
it
is
by
them
that
he
is
himself
described
it
comes
to
this
that
the
picture
which
harry
richmond
gives
of
his
career
has
a
function
essentially
dramatic
it
has
a
part
to
perform
in
the
story
a
part
it
must
undertake
as
a
whole
over
and
above
its
pictorial
charge
it
must
do
something
as
well
as
be
it
must
create
even
while
it
is
created
in
esmond
and
in
copperfield
it
is
otherwise
there
the
unrolling
scene
has
little
or
no
part
to
play
as
a
scene
over
against
another
actor
it
holds
no
dialogue
so
to
speak
sustains
no
interchange
or
none
of
principal
importance
with
the
figure
of
the
narrator
he
narrates
he
creates
the
picture
but
for
us
who
look
on
reading
the
book
there
is
nothing
in
the
picture
to
make
us
perpetually
turn
from
it
and
face
towards
the
man
in
the
foreground
watching
for
the
effect
it
may
produce
in
him
attention
is
all
concentrated
in
the
life
that
he
remembers
and
evokes
he
himself
indeed
though
the
fact
of
his
presence
is
very
clear
to
us
tends
to
remain
in
shadow
it
is
as
though
he
leant
from
a
window
surveying
the
world
his
figure
outlined
against
the
lighted
square
his
features
not
very
distinctly
discerned
by
the
reader
within
it
is
enough
that
he
should
make
micawber
live
again
make
beatrix
appear
on
the
staircase
of
the
old
house
with
her
scarlet
ribbon
and
the
taper
in
her
hand
owe
everything
to
the
presence
of
the
man
who
calls
them
back
from
the
past
they
receive
their
being
they
do
little
in
return
this
picture
this
bright
vision
spied
through
the
clever
ministration
of
a
narrator
is
not
enough
for
harry
richmond
here
the
peopled
view
all
of
it
together
is
like
an
actor
in
a
play
and
the
interlocutor
the
protagonist
is
the
man
in
the
foreground
harry
himself
there
is
no
question
of
simply
seeing
through
his
eyes
sharing
his
memory
perhaps
even
a
little
forgetting
him
from
time
to
time
when
the
figured
scene
is
particularly
delightful
the
thought
the
fancy
the
emotion
of
harry
richmond
are
the
centre
of
the
play
from
these
to
the
men
and
women
who
shape
his
fate
from
them
again
to
the
mind
that
recalls
them
attention
passes
and
returns
we
who
look
on
are
continually
occupied
with
the
fact
of
harry
consciousness
its
gradual
enlargement
and
enrichment
that
is
the
process
which
ottilia
and
janet
and
the
rest
of
them
are
expected
to
forward
and
they
contribute
actively
harry
before
the
quest
of
the
princess
and
harry
when
it
has
finally
failed
are
different
beings
so
far
as
a
man
is
changed
by
an
experience
that
is
absorbed
into
the
whole
of
his
nature
how
is
the
change
effected
what
does
it
achieve
the
episode
bringing
the
change
into
view
dramatizes
it
and
the
question
is
answered
the
young
has
run
an
eventful
course
and
he
gives
his
account
of
it
but
the
leading
event
of
his
tale
is
himself
his
account
illustrates
that
event
helps
towards
the
enactment
of
it
pictorial
therefore
in
form
dramatic
in
function
such
was
the
story
that
meredith
elected
to
tell
in
the
first
person
and
in
so
doing
he
showed
as
it
seems
to
me
precisely
where
the
defect
of
the
method
begins
to
be
felt
the
method
has
a
certain
dramatic
energy
we
have
seen
making
a
visible
fact
of
the
relation
otherwise
unexplained
between
the
narrator
and
the
tale
it
has
this
but
for
a
subject
like
meredith
it
is
really
too
little
and
the
use
of
the
first
person
is
overtaxed
does
he
contrive
to
conceal
the
trouble
does
he
make
us
exceedingly
unconscious
of
it
while
we
read
the
book
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
does
with
the
humanity
and
poetry
and
wisdom
that
he
pours
into
it
the
novel
of
which
it
has
been
said
that
if
shakespeare
revisited
the
globe
and
asked
for
a
book
of
our
times
to
read
this
would
be
the
volume
to
offer
him
the
book
more
likely
than
another
to
convince
him
at
once
that
literature
is
still
in
our
midst
there
is
small
doubt
that
meredith
disguises
the
trouble
and
there
is
still
less
that
he
was
quite
unaware
of
it
himself
but
it
is
there
and
it
shows
plainly
enough
in
some
novels
where
a
personal
narrator
is
given
the
same
kind
of
task
and
in
meredith
book
too
i
think
it
is
not
to
be
missed
when
one
considers
what
might
have
been
supposing
meredith
had
chosen
another
way
the
other
way
was
open
he
can
not
have
noticed
it
the
young
man
harry
this
is
the
trouble
is
only
a
recorder
a
so
long
as
he
speaks
for
himself
he
is
very
well
placed
for
describing
his
world
which
somebody
to
describe
it
his
world
is
much
too
big
and
complex
to
be
shown
scenically
in
those
immediate
terms
i
spoke
of
just
now
in
connection
with
maupassant
story
scenes
of
drama
there
may
be
from
time
to
time
there
are
plenty
in
meredith
novel
but
still
on
the
whole
the
story
must
be
given
as
the
view
of
an
onlooker
and
harry
is
clearly
the
onlooker
indicated
the
only
possible
one
that
is
certain
but
then
there
is
laid
upon
him
the
task
which
is
not
laid
or
barely
at
all
upon
copperfield
or
esmond
before
the
book
is
out
he
must
have
grown
to
ten
times
the
weight
that
we
dream
of
looking
for
in
either
of
them
he
must
be
distinct
to
see
can
not
remain
a
dim
silhouette
against
the
window
the
light
must
fall
full
upon
his
face
how
can
he
manage
it
how
can
he
give
that
sharp
impression
of
himself
that
he
easily
gives
of
his
world
it
is
a
query
that
he
is
in
no
position
to
meet
for
the
impossible
is
asked
of
him
he
is
expected
to
lend
us
his
eyes
which
he
does
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
present
himself
for
us
to
behold
with
our
own
the
subject
of
his
story
requires
no
less
it
is
not
merely
a
matter
of
seeing
his
personal
aspect
and
address
these
are
readily
given
by
implication
when
we
have
watched
for
a
while
the
behaviour
of
the
people
round
him
and
have
heard
something
of
his
experience
and
of
the
way
in
which
he
fared
in
the
world
we
shall
very
well
know
what
he
was
like
to
meet
what
others
saw
in
him
there
is
no
difficulty
here
but
harry
needs
a
great
deal
more
substance
than
this
if
his
story
is
to
be
rightly
understood
what
it
was
like
to
harry
with
all
that
action
and
reaction
of
character
and
fortune
proceeding
within
him
that
is
the
question
the
chief
question
and
since
it
is
the
most
important
affair
in
the
book
it
should
obviously
be
rendered
as
solidly
as
possible
by
the
most
emphatic
method
that
the
author
can
command
but
harry
speaking
of
himself
can
only
report
he
can
only
recall
the
past
and
us
what
he
was
only
his
emotion
and
he
may
describe
very
vividly
and
he
does
but
it
would
necessarily
be
more
convincing
if
we
could
get
behind
his
description
and
judge
for
ourselves
drama
we
want
always
drama
for
the
central
essential
paramount
affair
whatever
it
is
harry
consciousness
ought
to
be
dramatized
something
is
lost
if
it
is
represented
solely
by
his
account
of
it
meredith
may
enable
harry
to
give
an
account
so
brilliant
that
the
defect
is
forgotten
that
is
not
the
point
but
could
he
have
done
more
i
think
so
only
it
would
have
meant
the
surrender
of
the
method
of
autobiography
here
then
i
conclude
the
dramatizing
force
of
the
first
person
gives
out
it
is
very
useful
for
enhancing
the
value
of
a
picture
where
none
but
the
pictorial
method
is
available
where
we
are
bound
to
rely
upon
an
intervening
in
some
guise
or
other
it
is
much
more
satisfactory
to
know
who
the
is
and
to
see
him
as
a
part
of
the
story
than
to
be
deflected
away
from
the
book
by
the
author
an
arbitrary
unmeasurable
unappraisable
factor
but
when
the
man
in
the
book
is
expected
to
make
a
picture
of
himself
a
searching
and
elaborate
portrait
then
the
limit
of
his
capacity
is
touched
and
passed
or
rather
there
is
a
better
method
one
of
finer
capacity
then
ready
to
the
author
hand
and
there
is
no
reason
to
be
content
with
the
hero
mere
report
the
figure
of
the
is
a
dramatic
fact
in
meredith
book
and
that
is
all
to
the
good
but
the
inner
history
it
is
not
clear
that
we
need
the
intervention
of
anybody
in
this
matter
and
if
it
might
be
dramatized
made
immediately
visible
dramatized
it
evidently
should
be
by
all
means
let
us
have
harry
account
if
we
must
have
somebody
but
perhaps
there
is
no
such
need
there
seems
to
be
none
it
is
surely
time
to
take
the
next
step
in
the
process
i
am
trying
to
track
x
and
the
next
step
is
to
lay
aside
the
autobiographic
device
which
the
novelist
was
seen
to
adopt
a
few
pages
ago
in
the
interest
of
drama
when
it
has
served
as
dickens
and
thackeray
made
it
serve
it
seems
to
have
shown
the
extent
of
its
power
if
the
picture
of
a
life
is
to
be
still
further
dramatized
other
arts
must
be
called
into
play
i
am
still
assuming
that
the
novel
under
consideration
is
one
that
postulates
as
indeed
most
novels
do
a
point
of
view
which
is
not
that
of
the
reader
i
am
supposing
that
the
story
requires
a
seeing
eye
in
the
sense
i
suggested
in
speaking
of
vanity
fair
if
no
such
selecting
interpreting
composing
minister
is
needed
then
we
have
drama
unmixed
and
i
shall
come
across
an
example
or
so
in
fiction
later
on
it
is
drama
unmixed
when
the
reader
is
squarely
in
front
of
the
scene
all
the
time
knowing
nothing
about
the
story
beyond
so
much
as
may
be
gathered
from
the
aspect
of
the
scene
the
look
and
speech
of
the
people
that
does
not
happen
often
in
fiction
except
in
short
pieces
small
and
still
i
am
concerned
with
the
kind
of
book
that
preponderantly
needs
the
seeing
eye
the
kind
of
novel
that
i
call
distinctively
pictorial
the
novelist
therefore
returns
to
the
third
person
again
but
he
returns
with
a
marked
difference
he
by
no
means
resumes
his
original
part
that
of
thackeray
in
vanity
fair
for
his
hero
personal
narration
he
does
not
substitute
his
own
once
more
it
is
still
the
man
in
the
book
who
sees
and
judges
and
reflects
all
the
picture
of
life
is
still
rendered
in
the
hero
terms
but
the
difference
is
that
instead
of
receiving
his
report
we
now
see
him
in
the
act
of
judging
and
reflecting
his
consciousness
no
longer
a
matter
of
hearsay
a
matter
for
which
we
must
take
his
word
is
now
before
us
in
its
original
agitation
here
is
a
spectacle
for
the
reader
with
no
obtrusive
interpreter
no
transmitter
of
light
no
conductor
of
meaning
this
man
interior
life
is
cast
into
the
world
of
independent
rounded
objects
it
is
given
room
to
show
itself
it
appears
it
a
distinction
is
made
between
the
scene
which
the
man
surveys
and
the
energy
within
him
which
converts
it
all
into
the
stuff
of
his
own
being
the
scene
as
much
as
ever
is
watched
through
his
eyes
but
now
there
is
this
other
fact
in
front
of
the
scene
actually
under
the
hand
of
the
reader
to
this
fact
the
value
of
drama
has
accrued
meredith
would
have
sacrificed
nothing
so
far
as
i
can
see
by
proceeding
to
the
further
stage
in
harry
richmond
unless
perhaps
the
story
told
in
the
third
person
might
seem
to
lose
some
of
its
airings
of
romance
on
the
other
hand
the
advantage
of
following
the
stir
of
harry
imagination
it
is
stirring
would
be
great
the
effect
would
be
straighter
the
impression
deeper
the
reader
would
have
been
nearer
to
harry
throughout
and
more
closely
implicated
in
his
affair
think
of
the
young
man
for
instance
in
dostoevsky
crime
and
punishment
there
is
a
young
man
whose
experience
surrounds
and
presses
upon
the
reader
is
felt
and
tasted
and
endured
by
the
reader
and
any
one
who
has
been
through
the
book
has
truly
become
raskolnikov
and
knows
exactly
what
it
was
to
be
that
young
man
drama
is
there
pushed
into
the
theatre
of
a
mind
the
play
proceeds
with
the
reading
of
the
book
accompanying
the
eye
that
falls
on
it
how
could
a
retrospect
in
the
words
of
the
young
man
only
of
course
dostoevsky
had
no
choice
in
the
matter
such
a
method
was
ruled
out
but
supposing
the
story
had
admitted
it
how
could
a
retrospect
have
given
raskolnikov
thus
bodily
into
the
reader
possession
there
could
have
been
no
conviction
in
his
own
account
comparable
with
the
certainty
which
dostoevsky
has
left
to
us
and
left
because
he
neither
spoke
for
himself
as
the
communicative
author
nor
allowed
raskolnikov
to
speak
but
uncovered
the
man
mind
and
made
us
look
it
seems
then
to
be
a
principle
of
the
art
that
a
personal
narrator
will
do
very
well
and
may
be
extremely
helpful
so
long
as
the
story
is
only
the
reflection
of
life
beyond
and
outside
him
but
that
as
soon
as
the
story
begins
to
find
its
centre
of
gravity
in
his
own
life
as
soon
as
the
main
weight
of
attention
is
claimed
for
the
speaker
rather
than
for
the
scene
then
his
report
of
himself
becomes
a
matter
which
might
be
strengthened
and
which
should
accordingly
give
way
to
the
stronger
method
this
i
take
to
be
a
general
principle
and
where
it
appears
to
be
violated
a
critic
would
instinctively
look
for
the
particular
reason
which
makes
it
inapplicable
to
the
particular
case
no
reflection
no
picture
where
living
drama
is
possible
it
is
a
good
rule
do
not
let
the
hero
come
between
us
and
his
active
mind
do
not
let
the
heroine
stand
in
front
of
her
emotions
and
portray
them
unless
for
cause
for
some
needful
effect
that
would
otherwise
be
missed
i
see
the
reason
and
the
effect
very
plainly
in
thackeray
barry
lyndon
to
take
a
casual
example
where
the
point
of
the
whole
thing
is
that
the
man
should
give
himself
away
unknowingly
in
jane
eyre
to
take
another
i
see
neither
but
it
is
hard
to
throw
such
a
dry
question
upon
tragic
little
jane
if
it
should
still
be
doubted
however
whether
the
right
use
of
autobiography
is
really
so
limited
it
might
be
a
good
answer
to
point
to
henry
james
strether
in
the
ambassadors
strether
may
stand
as
a
living
demonstration
of
all
that
autobiography
can
not
achieve
he
is
enough
to
prove
finally
how
far
the
intricate
performance
of
thought
is
beyond
the
power
of
a
man
to
record
in
his
own
language
of
strether
thought
that
is
to
say
of
the
silvery
activity
which
makes
him
what
he
is
would
be
lost
but
for
the
fact
that
its
adventures
are
caught
in
time
while
they
are
proceeding
and
enacted
in
the
book
pictured
by
him
as
he
might
himself
look
back
on
them
they
would
drop
to
the
same
plane
as
the
rest
of
the
scene
the
picture
of
the
other
people
in
the
story
his
state
of
mind
would
figure
in
his
description
on
the
same
terms
as
the
world
about
him
it
would
simply
be
a
matter
for
him
to
describe
like
another
in
the
book
as
it
is
strether
personally
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
impression
that
is
made
by
the
mazy
career
of
his
imagination
he
has
no
hand
in
the
effect
it
produces
it
speaks
for
itself
it
spreads
over
the
scene
and
colours
the
world
just
as
it
did
for
strether
it
is
immediately
in
the
foreground
and
the
seeing
eye
to
which
it
is
presented
is
not
his
but
the
reader
own
no
longer
a
figure
that
leans
and
looks
out
of
a
window
scanning
a
stretch
of
memory
that
is
not
the
image
suggested
by
henry
book
it
is
rather
as
though
the
reader
himself
were
at
the
window
and
as
though
the
window
opened
straight
into
the
depths
of
conscious
existence
the
energy
of
his
perception
and
discrimination
is
there
seen
at
work
his
mind
is
the
mirror
of
the
scene
beyond
it
and
the
other
people
in
the
book
exist
only
in
relation
to
him
but
his
mind
his
own
thought
of
them
is
there
absolutely
its
restless
evolution
is
in
full
sight
i
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
complete
account
of
the
principle
on
which
the
book
is
constructed
for
indeed
the
principle
goes
further
encompassing
points
of
method
to
be
dealt
with
later
but
for
the
moment
let
the
book
stand
as
the
type
of
the
novel
in
which
a
mind
is
dramatized
reflecting
the
life
to
which
it
is
exposed
but
itself
performing
its
own
peculiar
and
private
life
this
last
in
the
case
of
strether
involves
a
gradual
change
from
the
moment
when
he
takes
up
the
charge
of
rescuing
his
young
friend
from
the
siren
of
paris
to
the
moment
when
he
finds
himself
wishing
that
his
young
friend
would
refuse
to
be
rescued
such
is
the
curve
in
the
unexpected
adventure
of
his
imagination
it
is
given
as
nobody
view
not
his
own
as
it
would
be
if
he
told
the
story
himself
and
not
the
author
as
it
would
be
if
henry
james
told
the
story
the
author
does
not
tell
the
story
of
strether
mind
he
makes
it
tell
itself
he
dramatizes
it
thus
it
is
that
the
novelist
pushes
his
responsibility
further
and
further
away
from
himself
the
fiction
that
he
devises
is
ultimately
his
but
it
looks
poor
and
thin
if
he
openly
claims
it
as
his
or
at
any
rate
it
becomes
much
more
substantial
as
soon
as
he
fathers
it
upon
another
this
is
not
story
says
the
author
you
know
nothing
of
me
it
is
the
story
of
this
man
or
woman
in
whose
words
you
have
it
and
he
or
she
is
a
person
whom
you
know
and
you
may
see
for
yourselves
how
the
matter
arose
the
man
and
woman
being
such
as
they
are
it
all
hangs
together
and
it
makes
a
solid
and
significant
piece
of
life
and
having
said
this
the
author
has
only
moved
the
question
a
stage
further
and
it
reappears
in
exactly
the
same
form
the
man
or
the
woman
after
all
is
only
telling
and
stating
and
we
are
still
invited
to
accept
the
story
upon
authority
the
narrator
may
do
his
best
and
may
indeed
do
so
well
that
to
hear
his
account
is
as
good
as
having
seen
what
he
describes
and
nothing
could
be
better
than
that
the
matter
might
rest
there
if
this
were
all
but
it
must
depend
considerably
on
the
nature
of
his
story
for
it
may
happen
that
he
tells
and
describes
things
that
a
man
is
never
really
in
a
position
to
substantiate
his
account
of
himself
for
example
can
not
be
thoroughly
valid
not
through
any
want
of
candour
on
his
part
but
simply
because
no
man
can
completely
objectify
himself
and
a
credible
account
of
anything
must
appear
to
detach
it
to
set
it
altogether
free
for
inspection
and
so
the
novelist
passes
on
towards
drama
gets
behind
the
narrator
and
represents
the
mind
of
the
narrator
as
in
itself
a
kind
of
action
by
so
doing
be
it
noted
he
forfeits
none
of
his
special
freedom
as
i
have
called
it
the
faculty
that
he
enjoys
as
a
he
is
not
constrained
like
the
playwright
to
turn
his
story
into
dramatic
action
and
nothing
else
he
has
dramatized
his
novel
step
by
step
until
the
mind
of
the
strether
or
raskolnikov
is
present
upon
the
page
but
strether
and
raskolnikov
are
just
as
free
to
project
their
view
of
the
world
to
picture
it
for
the
reader
as
they
might
be
if
they
spoke
in
person
the
difference
is
in
the
fact
that
we
now
see
the
very
sources
of
the
activity
within
them
we
not
only
share
their
vision
we
watch
them
absorbing
it
strether
in
particular
with
a
mind
working
so
diligently
upon
every
grain
of
his
experience
is
a
most
luminous
painter
of
the
world
in
which
he
moves
a
small
circle
but
nothing
in
it
escapes
him
and
he
imparts
his
summary
of
a
thousand
matters
to
the
reader
the
view
that
he
opens
is
as
panoramic
often
enough
as
any
of
thackeray
sweeping
surveys
only
the
scale
is
different
with
a
word
barely
breathed
in
place
of
a
dialogue
minutes
for
months
a
turn
of
a
head
or
an
intercepted
glance
for
a
chronicle
of
crime
or
adulterous
intrigue
that
liberty
therefore
of
standing
above
the
story
and
taking
a
broad
view
of
many
things
of
transcending
the
limits
of
the
immediate
scene
nothing
of
this
is
sacrificed
by
the
author
steady
advance
in
the
direction
of
drama
the
man
mind
has
become
visible
phenomenal
dramatic
but
in
acting
its
part
it
still
lends
us
eyes
is
still
an
opportunity
of
extended
vision
it
thus
becomes
clear
why
the
prudent
novelist
tends
to
prefer
an
indirect
to
a
direct
method
the
simple
begins
by
addressing
himself
openly
to
the
reader
and
then
exchanges
this
method
for
another
and
another
and
with
each
modification
he
reaches
the
reader
from
a
further
remove
the
more
circuitous
procedure
on
the
part
of
the
author
produces
a
straighter
effect
for
the
reader
that
is
why
other
things
being
equal
the
more
dramatic
way
is
better
than
the
less
it
is
indirect
as
a
method
but
it
places
the
thing
itself
in
view
instead
of
recalling
and
reflecting
and
picturing
it
for
any
story
no
doubt
there
is
an
ideal
point
upon
this
line
of
progress
towards
drama
where
the
author
finds
the
right
method
of
telling
the
story
the
point
is
indicated
by
the
subject
of
the
story
itself
by
the
particular
matter
that
is
to
be
brought
out
and
made
plain
and
the
author
while
he
regards
the
subject
and
nothing
else
is
guided
to
the
best
manner
of
treatment
by
a
twofold
consideration
in
the
first
place
he
wishes
the
story
so
far
as
possible
to
speak
for
itself
the
people
and
the
action
to
appear
independently
rather
than
to
be
described
and
explained
to
this
end
the
method
is
raised
to
the
highest
dramatic
power
that
the
subject
allows
until
at
last
perhaps
it
is
found
that
nothing
need
be
explained
at
all
there
need
be
no
revelation
of
anybody
thought
no
going
behind
any
of
the
appearances
on
the
surface
of
the
action
even
the
necessary
description
as
we
shall
see
later
on
may
be
so
treated
that
this
too
gains
the
value
of
drama
such
is
the
first
care
of
the
prudent
novelist
and
i
have
dwelt
upon
it
in
detail
but
it
is
accompanied
and
checked
by
another
not
less
important
this
is
his
care
for
economy
the
method
is
to
be
pushed
as
far
as
the
subject
can
profit
by
it
but
no
further
it
may
happen
for
instance
in
david
copperfield
that
the
story
no
high
dramatic
value
and
that
it
would
get
no
advantage
from
a
more
dramatic
method
if
it
would
gain
nothing
it
would
undoubtedly
lose
the
subject
would
be
and
would
suffer
accordingly
nothing
would
have
been
easier
than
for
dickens
to
take
the
next
step
as
i
call
it
to
treat
his
story
from
the
point
of
view
of
david
but
not
as
david
own
narration
dickens
might
have
laid
bare
the
mind
of
his
hero
and
showed
its
operation
as
dostoevsky
did
with
his
young
man
there
was
no
reason
for
doing
so
however
since
the
subject
is
not
essentially
in
david
at
all
but
in
the
linked
fortunes
of
a
number
of
people
grouped
around
him
david
consciousness
if
we
watched
it
instead
of
listening
to
his
story
would
be
unsubstantial
indeed
dickens
would
be
driven
to
enrich
it
giving
him
a
more
complicated
life
within
with
the
result
that
the
centre
would
be
displaced
and
the
subject
so
far
obscured
a
story
is
damaged
by
too
much
treatment
as
by
too
little
and
the
severely
practical
need
of
true
economy
in
all
that
concerns
a
novel
is
demonstrated
once
more
i
go
no
further
for
the
moment
i
do
not
yet
consider
how
the
picture
of
a
man
mind
is
turned
into
action
induced
to
assume
the
look
of
an
objective
play
it
is
a
very
pretty
achievement
of
art
perhaps
the
most
interesting
effect
that
fiction
is
able
to
produce
and
i
think
it
may
be
described
more
closely
but
i
return
meanwhile
to
the
device
of
the
first
person
and
to
another
example
of
the
way
in
which
it
is
used
for
its
dramatic
energy
for
my
point
is
so
oddly
illustrated
by
the
old
contrivance
of
the
epistolary
novel
that
i
can
not
omit
to
glance
at
it
briefly
the
kind
of
enhancement
which
is
sought
by
the
method
of
the
ambassadors
is
actually
the
very
same
as
that
which
is
sought
by
the
method
of
clarissa
and
grandison
richardson
and
henry
james
they
are
both
faced
by
the
same
difficulty
one
of
them
is
acutely
aware
of
it
and
takes
very
precautions
to
circumvent
it
the
other
i
suppose
does
not
trouble
about
the
theory
of
his
procedure
but
he
too
adopts
a
certain
artifice
which
carries
him
past
the
particular
problem
though
at
the
same
time
it
involves
him
in
several
more
little
as
richardson
may
suspect
it
he
and
whoever
else
has
the
idea
of
making
a
story
out
of
a
series
of
letters
or
a
running
diary
written
from
day
to
day
is
engaged
in
the
attempt
to
show
a
mind
in
action
to
give
a
dramatic
display
of
the
commotion
within
a
breast
he
desires
to
get
into
the
closest
touch
with
clarissa
life
and
to
set
the
reader
in
the
midst
of
it
and
this
is
a
possible
expedient
though
it
certainly
has
its
drawbacks
he
wishes
to
avoid
throwing
clarissa
agitations
into
the
past
and
treating
them
as
a
historical
matter
if
they
were
to
become
the
subject
of
a
record
compiled
by
her
biographer
something
would
be
lost
there
would
be
no
longer
the
same
sense
of
meeting
clarissa
afresh
every
morning
and
of
witnessing
the
new
development
of
her
wrongs
and
woes
already
a
little
more
poignant
than
they
were
last
night
even
if
he
set
clarissa
to
write
the
story
in
after
days
preserving
her
life
for
the
purpose
she
could
not
quite
give
us
this
recurring
suspense
and
shock
of
sympathy
the
lesson
of
her
fortitude
would
be
weakened
reading
her
letters
you
hear
the
cry
that
was
wrung
from
her
at
the
moment
you
look
forward
with
her
in
dismay
to
the
ominous
morrow
the
spectacle
of
her
bearing
under
such
terrible
trials
is
immediate
and
urgent
you
accompany
her
step
by
step
the
end
still
in
the
future
knowing
no
more
than
she
how
the
next
corner
is
to
be
turned
this
is
truly
to
share
her
life
to
lead
it
by
her
side
to
profit
by
her
example
at
any
rate
her
example
is
eloquently
present
richardson
or
another
whoever
first
thought
of
making
her
tell
her
story
while
she
is
still
in
the
thick
of
it
invented
a
fashion
of
dramatizing
her
sensibility
that
is
found
to
be
serviceable
occasionally
even
now
though
scarcely
for
an
enterprise
on
clarissa
scale
her
emotion
like
strether
is
caught
in
passing
like
him
she
dispenses
with
the
need
of
a
seer
a
reflector
some
one
who
will
form
an
impression
of
her
state
of
mind
and
reproduce
it
the
struggles
of
her
heart
are
not
made
the
material
of
a
chronicle
she
reports
them
indeed
but
at
such
brief
and
punctual
intervals
that
her
report
is
like
a
wheel
of
life
it
reveals
her
heart
in
its
very
pulsation
the
queer
and
perverse
idea
of
keeping
her
continually
bent
over
her
pen
she
must
have
written
for
many
hours
every
day
has
at
least
this
advantage
that
for
the
spectator
it
keeps
her
long
ordeal
always
in
the
foreground
clarissa
troubles
fall
within
the
book
as
i
have
expressed
it
they
are
contemporaneous
they
are
happening
while
she
writes
this
latest
agony
is
a
new
one
since
she
wrote
last
which
was
only
yesterday
much
that
is
denied
to
autobiography
is
thus
gained
by
clarissa
method
and
for
her
story
the
advantage
is
valuable
the
subject
of
her
story
is
not
in
the
distressing
events
but
in
her
emotion
and
her
comportment
under
the
strain
how
a
young
gentlewoman
suffers
and
conducts
herself
in
such
a
situation
that
was
what
richardson
had
to
show
and
the
action
of
the
tale
is
shaped
round
this
question
lovelace
hatches
his
villainies
in
order
that
the
subject
of
the
book
may
be
exhaustively
illustrated
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
conflict
within
clarissa
should
hold
the
centre
and
for
this
the
epistolary
method
does
indeed
provide
richardson
makes
the
most
of
it
without
doubt
he
has
strained
it
to
its
utmost
capacity
before
he
has
done
with
it
a
writer
who
thinks
of
constructing
a
novel
out
of
somebody
correspondence
may
surely
consult
clarissa
upon
all
the
details
of
the
craft
and
clarissa
and
grandison
still
more
will
also
give
the
fullest
warning
of
the
impracticability
of
the
method
after
all
for
richardson
is
forced
to
pay
heavily
for
its
single
benefit
he
pays
with
the
desperate
shifts
to
which
he
is
driven
in
order
to
maintain
any
kind
of
verisimilitude
the
visible
effort
of
keeping
all
clarissa
friends
at
a
distance
all
the
time
so
that
she
may
be
enabled
to
communicate
only
by
letter
seems
always
on
the
point
of
bearing
him
down
while
in
the
case
of
grandison
it
may
be
said
to
do
so
finally
when
miss
byron
is
reduced
to
reporting
to
her
friend
what
another
friend
has
reported
concerning
sir
charles
report
of
his
past
life
among
the
italians
i
only
speak
of
these
wonderful
books
however
for
the
other
aspect
of
their
method
because
it
shows
a
stage
in
the
natural
struggle
of
the
mere
record
to
become
something
more
to
develop
independent
life
and
to
appear
as
action
where
the
record
is
one
of
emotions
and
sentiments
delicately
traced
and
disentangled
it
is
not
so
easy
to
see
how
they
may
be
exposed
to
an
immediate
view
and
here
is
a
manner
not
very
handy
indeed
but
effective
in
its
degree
of
meeting
the
difficulty
xi
and
now
for
the
method
by
which
the
picture
of
a
mind
is
fully
dramatized
the
method
which
is
to
be
seen
consistently
applied
in
the
ambassadors
and
the
other
later
novels
of
henry
james
how
is
the
author
to
withdraw
to
stand
aside
and
to
let
strether
thought
tell
its
own
story
the
thing
must
be
seen
from
our
own
point
of
view
and
no
other
author
and
hero
thackeray
and
esmond
meredith
and
harry
richmond
have
given
their
various
accounts
of
emotional
and
intellectual
adventure
but
they
might
do
more
they
might
bring
the
facts
of
the
adventure
upon
the
scene
and
leave
them
to
make
their
impression
the
story
passes
in
an
invisible
world
the
events
take
place
in
the
man
mind
and
we
might
have
to
conclude
that
they
lie
beyond
our
reach
and
that
we
can
not
attain
to
them
save
by
the
help
of
the
man
himself
or
of
the
author
who
knows
all
about
him
we
might
have
to
make
the
best
of
an
account
at
second
hand
and
it
would
not
occur
to
us
i
dare
say
that
anything
more
could
be
forthcoming
we
seem
to
touch
the
limit
of
the
possibilities
of
drama
in
fiction
but
it
is
not
the
final
limit
there
is
fiction
here
to
prove
it
and
it
is
this
further
stroke
of
the
art
that
i
would
now
examine
the
world
of
silent
thought
is
thrown
open
and
instead
of
telling
the
reader
what
happened
there
the
novelist
uses
the
look
and
behaviour
of
thought
as
the
vehicle
by
which
the
story
is
rendered
just
as
the
writer
of
a
play
embodies
his
subject
in
visible
action
and
audible
speech
so
the
novelist
dealing
with
a
situation
like
strether
represents
it
by
means
of
the
movement
that
flickers
over
the
surface
of
his
mind
the
impulses
and
reactions
of
his
mood
are
the
players
upon
the
new
scene
in
drama
of
the
theatre
a
character
must
bear
his
part
unaided
if
he
is
required
to
be
a
desperate
man
harbouring
thoughts
of
crime
he
can
not
look
to
the
author
to
appear
at
the
side
of
the
stage
and
inform
the
audience
of
the
fact
he
must
express
it
for
himself
through
his
words
and
deeds
his
looks
and
tones
the
playwright
so
arranges
the
matter
that
these
will
be
enough
the
spectator
will
make
the
right
inference
but
suppose
that
instead
of
a
man
upon
the
stage
concealing
and
betraying
his
thought
we
watch
the
thought
itself
the
hidden
thing
as
it
twists
to
and
fro
in
his
brain
watch
it
without
any
other
aid
to
understanding
but
such
as
its
own
manner
of
bearing
may
supply
the
novelist
more
free
than
the
playwright
could
of
course
us
if
he
chose
what
lurks
behind
this
agitated
spirit
he
could
step
forward
and
explain
the
restless
appearance
of
the
man
thought
but
if
he
prefers
the
dramatic
way
admittedly
the
more
effective
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
taking
it
the
man
thought
in
its
turn
can
be
made
to
reveal
its
own
inwardness
let
us
see
how
this
plan
is
pursued
in
the
ambassadors
that
book
is
entirely
concerned
with
strether
experience
of
his
peculiar
mission
to
europe
and
never
passes
outside
the
circle
of
his
thought
strether
is
despatched
it
will
be
remembered
by
a
resolute
new
england
widow
whose
son
is
living
lightly
in
paris
instead
of
attending
to
business
at
home
to
win
the
hand
of
the
widow
strether
must
succeed
in
snatching
the
young
man
from
the
siren
who
is
believed
to
have
beguiled
him
the
mission
is
undertaken
in
all
good
faith
strether
descends
upon
paris
with
a
mind
properly
disposed
and
resolved
he
comes
as
an
ambassador
representing
principle
and
duty
to
treat
with
the
young
man
appeal
to
him
convincingly
and
bear
him
off
the
task
before
him
may
be
difficult
but
his
purpose
is
simple
strether
has
reckoned
however
without
his
imagination
he
had
scarcely
been
aware
of
possessing
one
before
but
everything
grows
complicated
as
it
is
touched
and
awakened
on
the
new
scene
by
degrees
and
degrees
he
changes
his
opinion
of
the
life
of
freedom
it
is
most
unlike
his
prevision
of
it
and
at
last
his
purpose
is
actually
inverted
he
no
longer
sees
a
misguided
young
man
to
be
saved
from
disaster
he
sees
an
exquisite
bountiful
world
laid
at
a
young
feet
and
now
the
only
question
is
whether
the
young
man
is
capable
of
meeting
and
grasping
his
opportunity
he
is
incapable
as
it
turns
out
when
the
story
ends
he
is
on
the
verge
of
rejecting
his
freedom
and
going
back
to
the
world
of
commonplace
strether
mission
has
ended
successfully
but
in
strether
mind
the
revolution
is
complete
there
is
nothing
left
for
him
no
reward
and
no
future
the
world
of
commonplace
is
no
longer
world
and
he
is
too
late
to
seize
the
other
he
is
old
he
has
missed
the
opportunity
of
youth
this
is
a
story
which
must
obviously
be
told
from
strether
point
of
view
in
the
first
place
the
change
in
his
purpose
is
due
to
a
change
in
his
vision
and
the
long
slow
process
could
not
be
followed
unless
his
vision
were
shared
by
the
reader
strether
predicament
that
is
to
say
could
not
be
placed
upon
the
stage
his
outward
behaviour
his
conduct
his
talk
do
not
express
a
tithe
of
it
only
the
brain
behind
his
eyes
can
be
aware
of
the
colour
of
his
experience
as
it
passes
through
its
innumerable
gradations
and
all
understanding
of
his
case
depends
upon
seeing
these
the
way
of
the
author
therefore
who
takes
this
subject
in
hand
is
clear
enough
at
the
outset
it
is
a
purely
pictorial
subject
covering
strether
field
of
vision
and
bounded
by
its
limits
it
consists
entirely
of
an
impression
received
by
a
certain
man
there
can
accordingly
be
no
thought
of
rendering
him
as
a
figure
seen
from
without
nothing
that
any
one
else
could
discern
looking
at
him
and
listening
to
his
conversation
would
give
the
full
sense
of
the
eventful
life
he
is
leading
within
the
dramatic
method
as
we
ordinarily
understand
it
is
ruled
out
at
once
neither
as
an
action
set
before
the
reader
without
interpretation
from
within
nor
yet
as
an
action
pictured
for
the
reader
by
some
other
onlooker
in
the
book
can
this
story
possibly
be
told
strether
real
situation
in
fact
is
not
his
open
and
visible
situation
between
the
lady
in
new
england
and
the
young
man
in
paris
his
grand
adventure
is
not
expressed
in
its
incidents
these
as
they
are
devised
by
the
author
are
secondary
they
are
the
extension
of
the
moral
event
that
takes
place
in
the
breast
of
the
ambassador
his
change
of
mind
that
is
the
very
middle
of
the
subject
it
is
a
matter
that
lies
solely
between
strether
himself
and
his
vision
of
the
free
world
it
is
a
delightful
effect
of
irony
indeed
that
he
should
have
accomplished
his
errand
after
all
in
spite
of
himself
but
the
point
of
the
book
is
not
there
the
ironic
climax
only
serves
to
bring
out
the
point
more
sharply
the
reversal
of
his
own
idea
is
underlined
and
enhanced
by
the
reversal
of
the
young
man
idea
in
the
opposite
sense
but
essentially
the
subject
of
the
book
would
be
unchanged
if
the
story
ended
differently
if
the
young
man
held
to
his
freedom
and
refused
to
go
home
strether
would
still
have
passed
through
the
same
cycle
of
unexpected
experience
his
errand
might
have
failed
but
still
it
would
not
have
been
any
the
more
impossible
for
him
to
claim
his
reward
for
his
part
than
it
is
impossible
as
things
are
with
the
quest
achieved
and
the
young
man
ready
to
hasten
back
to
duty
of
his
own
accord
and
so
the
subject
can
only
be
reached
through
strether
consciousness
it
is
plain
that
way
alone
will
command
the
impression
that
the
scene
makes
on
him
nothing
in
the
scene
has
any
importance
any
value
in
itself
what
strether
sees
in
it
that
is
the
whole
of
its
meaning
but
though
in
the
ambassadors
the
point
of
view
is
primarily
strether
and
though
it
to
be
his
throughout
the
book
there
is
in
fact
an
insidious
shifting
of
it
so
artfully
contrived
that
the
reader
may
arrive
at
the
end
without
suspecting
the
trick
the
reader
all
unawares
is
placed
in
a
better
position
for
an
understanding
of
strether
history
better
than
the
position
of
strether
himself
using
his
eyes
we
see
what
sees
we
are
possessed
of
the
material
on
which
his
patient
thought
sets
to
work
and
that
is
so
far
well
enough
and
plainly
necessary
all
the
other
people
in
the
book
face
towards
him
and
it
is
that
aspect
of
them
and
that
only
which
is
shown
to
the
reader
still
more
important
the
beautiful
picture
of
paris
and
the
stir
and
shimmer
of
life
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
is
strether
picture
vision
rendered
as
the
time
and
the
place
strike
upon
his
senses
all
this
on
which
his
thought
ruminates
the
stuff
that
occupies
it
is
represented
from
his
point
of
view
to
see
it
even
for
a
moment
from
some
different
angle
if
for
example
the
author
interposed
with
a
vision
of
his
own
would
patently
disturb
the
right
impression
the
author
does
no
such
thing
it
need
hardly
be
said
when
it
comes
to
strether
treatment
of
this
material
however
when
it
is
time
to
learn
what
he
makes
of
it
turning
his
experience
over
and
over
in
his
mind
then
his
own
point
of
view
no
longer
serves
how
is
anybody
even
strether
to
the
working
of
his
own
mind
a
mere
account
of
its
working
after
the
fact
has
already
been
barred
we
have
found
that
this
of
necessity
is
lacking
in
force
it
is
statement
where
we
look
for
demonstration
and
so
we
must
see
for
ourselves
the
author
must
so
arrange
matters
that
strether
thought
will
all
be
made
intelligible
by
a
direct
view
of
its
surface
the
immediate
flaw
or
ripple
of
the
moment
and
the
next
and
the
next
will
then
take
up
the
tale
like
the
speakers
in
a
dialogue
which
gradually
unfolds
the
subject
of
the
play
below
the
surface
behind
the
outer
aspect
of
his
mind
we
do
not
penetrate
this
is
drama
and
in
drama
the
spectator
must
judge
by
appearances
when
strether
mind
is
dramatized
nothing
is
shown
but
the
passing
images
that
anybody
might
detect
looking
down
upon
a
mind
grown
visible
there
is
no
drawing
upon
extraneous
sources
of
information
henry
james
knows
all
there
is
to
know
of
strether
but
he
most
carefully
refrains
from
using
his
knowledge
he
wishes
us
to
accept
nothing
from
him
on
authority
only
to
watch
and
learn
for
suppose
him
to
begin
sharing
the
knowledge
that
he
alone
possesses
as
the
author
and
inventor
of
strether
suppose
that
instead
of
representing
only
the
momentary
appearance
of
thought
he
begins
to
expound
its
substance
he
must
at
once
give
us
the
whole
of
it
must
let
us
into
every
secret
without
delay
or
his
exposition
is
plainly
misleading
it
is
assumed
that
he
tells
all
if
he
once
begins
and
so
too
if
the
book
were
cast
autobiographically
and
strether
spoke
in
person
he
could
not
hold
back
he
could
not
heighten
the
story
of
his
thought
with
that
touch
of
suspense
waiting
to
be
resolved
which
stamps
the
impression
so
firmly
into
the
memory
of
the
onlooker
in
a
tale
of
murder
and
mystery
there
is
one
man
who
can
not
possibly
be
the
narrator
and
that
is
the
murderer
himself
for
if
he
admits
us
into
his
mind
at
all
he
must
do
so
without
reserve
thereby
betraying
the
secret
that
we
ought
to
be
guessing
at
for
ourselves
but
by
this
method
of
the
ambassadors
the
mind
of
which
the
reader
is
made
free
strether
mind
is
not
given
away
there
is
no
need
for
it
to
yield
up
all
its
secrets
at
once
the
story
in
it
is
played
out
by
due
degrees
and
there
may
be
just
as
much
deliberation
refrainment
suspension
as
in
a
story
told
scenically
upon
the
stage
all
the
effect
of
true
drama
is
thus
at
the
disposal
of
the
author
even
when
he
seems
to
be
describing
and
picturing
the
consciousness
of
one
of
his
characters
he
arrives
at
the
point
where
apparently
nothing
but
a
summary
and
a
report
should
be
possible
and
even
there
he
is
precluded
from
none
of
the
privileges
of
a
dramatist
it
is
necessary
to
show
that
in
his
attitude
towards
his
european
errand
strether
is
slowly
turning
upon
himself
and
looking
in
another
direction
to
announce
the
fact
with
a
tabulation
of
his
reasons
would
be
the
historic
retrospective
undramatic
way
of
dealing
with
the
matter
to
bring
his
mind
into
view
at
the
different
moments
one
after
another
when
it
is
brushed
by
new
experience
to
make
a
little
scene
of
it
without
breaking
into
hidden
depths
where
the
change
of
purpose
is
proceeding
to
multiply
these
glimpses
until
the
silent
change
is
apparent
though
no
word
has
actually
been
said
of
it
this
is
henry
james
way
and
though
the
could
scarcely
be
more
devious
and
roundabout
always
refusing
the
short
cut
yet
by
these
very
qualities
and
precautions
it
finally
produces
the
most
direct
impression
for
the
reader
has
that
is
why
the
method
is
adopted
the
author
has
so
fashioned
his
book
that
his
own
part
in
the
narration
is
now
unobtrusive
to
the
last
degree
he
the
author
could
not
imaginably
figure
there
more
discreetly
his
part
in
the
effect
is
no
more
than
that
of
the
playwright
who
vanishes
and
leaves
his
people
to
act
the
story
only
instead
of
men
and
women
talking
together
in
strether
case
there
are
innumerable
images
of
thought
crowding
across
the
stage
expressing
the
story
in
their
behaviour
but
there
is
more
in
the
book
as
i
suggested
just
now
than
strether
vision
and
the
play
of
his
mind
in
the
episodes
the
colloquies
that
strether
holds
for
example
with
his
sympathetic
friend
maria
gostrey
another
turn
appears
in
the
author
procedure
throughout
these
dialogues
strether
point
of
view
still
reigns
the
only
eyes
in
the
matter
are
still
his
there
is
no
sight
of
the
man
himself
as
his
companion
sees
him
miss
gostrey
is
clearly
visible
and
madame
de
vionnet
and
little
bilham
or
whoever
it
may
be
the
face
of
strether
himself
is
never
turned
to
the
reader
on
the
evening
of
the
first
encounter
between
the
elderly
ambassador
and
the
young
man
they
sat
together
in
a
café
of
the
boulevards
and
walked
away
at
midnight
through
quiet
streets
and
all
through
their
interview
the
fact
of
the
young
man
appearance
is
strongly
dominant
for
it
is
this
that
first
reveals
to
strether
how
the
young
man
has
been
transformed
by
his
commerce
with
the
free
world
and
so
his
figure
is
sharply
before
the
reader
as
they
talk
how
strether
seemed
to
chad
this
too
is
represented
but
only
by
implication
through
chad
speech
and
manner
it
is
essential
of
course
that
it
should
be
so
the
vision
is
strictly
enjoined
by
the
method
of
the
whole
book
but
though
the
seeing
eye
is
still
with
strether
there
is
a
noticeable
change
in
the
author
way
with
him
in
these
scenic
dialogues
on
the
whole
we
seem
to
have
edged
away
from
strether
consciousness
he
sees
and
we
with
him
but
when
he
it
is
almost
as
though
we
were
outside
him
and
away
from
him
altogether
not
always
indeed
for
in
many
of
the
scenes
he
is
busily
brooding
and
thinking
throughout
and
we
share
his
mind
while
he
joins
in
the
talk
but
still
on
the
whole
the
author
is
inclined
to
leave
strether
alone
when
the
scene
is
set
he
talks
the
matter
out
with
maria
he
sits
and
talks
with
madame
de
vionnet
he
strolls
along
the
boulevards
with
chad
he
lounges
on
a
chair
in
the
champs
elysées
with
some
one
else
we
know
the
kind
of
scene
that
is
set
for
strether
know
how
very
few
accessories
he
requires
and
know
that
the
scene
marks
a
certain
definite
climax
wherever
it
occurs
for
all
its
everyday
look
the
occasion
is
important
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
its
importance
is
in
the
air
and
strether
takes
his
part
in
it
as
though
he
had
almost
become
what
he
can
not
be
an
objective
figure
for
the
reader
evidently
he
can
not
be
that
since
the
centre
of
vision
is
still
within
him
but
by
an
easy
sleight
of
hand
the
author
gives
him
almost
the
value
of
an
independent
person
a
man
to
whose
words
we
may
listen
expectantly
a
man
whose
mind
is
screened
from
us
again
and
again
the
stroke
is
accomplished
and
indeed
there
is
nothing
mysterious
about
it
simply
it
consists
in
treating
the
scene
as
dramatically
as
possible
keeping
it
framed
in
strether
vision
certainly
but
keeping
his
consciousness
out
of
sight
his
thought
he
talks
to
maria
and
to
us
to
the
reader
his
voice
seems
as
much
as
hers
to
belong
to
somebody
whom
we
are
which
is
impossible
because
our
point
of
view
is
his
a
small
matter
perhaps
but
it
is
interesting
as
a
sign
still
another
of
the
perpetual
tendency
of
the
novel
to
capture
the
advantages
which
it
appears
to
forego
the
ambassadors
is
without
doubt
a
book
that
deals
with
an
entirely
subject
it
is
the
picture
of
an
but
just
as
the
chapters
that
are
concerned
with
strether
soul
are
in
the
key
of
drama
after
the
fashion
i
have
described
so
too
the
episode
the
occasion
the
scene
that
crowns
the
impression
is
always
more
dramatic
in
its
method
than
it
apparently
has
the
means
to
be
here
for
instance
is
the
central
scene
of
the
whole
story
the
scene
in
the
old
parisian
garden
where
strether
finally
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
sensation
of
all
the
life
for
which
his
own
opportunity
has
passed
overflows
with
his
passionate
exhortation
to
little
bilham
warning
him
adjuring
him
not
to
make
mistake
not
to
let
life
slide
away
ungrasped
it
is
the
hour
in
which
strether
touches
his
crisis
and
the
first
necessity
of
the
chapter
is
to
show
the
sudden
lift
and
heave
of
his
mood
within
the
voices
and
admonitions
of
the
hour
that
is
to
say
must
be
heard
and
felt
as
he
hears
and
feels
them
himself
the
scene
then
will
be
given
as
strether
impression
clearly
and
so
it
is
the
old
garden
and
the
evening
light
and
the
shifting
company
of
people
appear
as
their
reflection
in
his
thought
but
the
scene
is
a
piece
of
drama
it
strikes
out
of
the
book
with
the
strong
relief
of
dramatic
action
which
is
evidently
an
advantage
gained
seeing
the
importance
of
the
hour
in
the
story
but
which
is
an
advantage
that
it
could
not
enjoy
one
might
have
said
the
quality
of
the
scene
becomes
clear
if
we
imagine
the
story
to
be
told
by
strether
himself
narrating
in
the
first
person
of
the
damage
that
this
would
entail
for
the
picture
of
his
brooding
mind
i
have
spoken
already
but
suppose
the
book
to
have
taken
the
form
of
autobiography
and
suppose
that
strether
has
brought
the
story
up
to
this
point
where
he
sits
beside
little
bilham
in
gloriani
garden
he
describes
the
deep
and
agitating
effect
of
the
scene
upon
him
calling
to
him
of
the
world
he
has
missed
he
tells
what
he
thought
and
felt
and
then
he
says
i
broke
out
with
the
following
tirade
to
little
bilham
and
we
have
the
energetic
outburst
which
henry
james
has
put
into
his
mouth
but
is
it
not
clear
how
the
incident
would
be
weakened
so
rendered
that
speech
word
for
word
as
we
have
it
would
lose
its
unexpected
and
dramatic
quality
because
strether
arriving
at
it
by
narration
could
not
suddenly
spring
away
from
himself
and
give
the
impression
of
the
worn
intelligent
man
sitting
there
in
the
evening
sun
strangely
moved
to
unwonted
eloquence
his
narration
must
have
discounted
the
effect
of
his
outburst
leading
us
up
to
the
very
edge
of
it
describing
how
it
arose
explaining
where
it
came
from
he
would
be
and
committed
to
remain
so
all
the
time
henry
james
by
his
method
can
secure
this
effect
of
drama
even
though
his
strether
is
apparently
in
the
position
of
a
narrator
throughout
strether
are
the
eyes
i
said
and
they
are
more
so
than
ever
during
this
hour
in
the
garden
he
is
the
sentient
creature
in
the
scene
but
the
author
who
all
through
the
story
has
been
treating
strether
consciousness
as
a
play
as
an
action
proceeding
can
at
any
moment
use
his
talk
almost
as
though
the
source
from
which
it
springs
were
unknown
to
us
from
within
i
remember
that
he
himself
in
his
critical
preface
to
the
book
calls
attention
to
the
way
in
which
a
conversation
between
strether
and
maria
gostrey
near
the
beginning
puts
the
reader
in
possession
of
all
the
past
facts
of
the
situation
which
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
know
a
thus
takes
the
place
of
that
harking
back
to
make
up
as
he
calls
it
which
is
apt
to
appear
as
a
lump
of
narrative
shortly
after
the
opening
of
a
story
if
strether
were
really
the
narrator
whether
in
the
first
person
or
the
third
he
could
not
use
his
own
talk
in
this
manner
he
would
have
to
tell
us
himself
about
his
past
but
he
has
never
us
his
thought
we
have
looked
at
it
and
drawn
our
inferences
and
so
there
is
still
some
air
of
dramatic
detachment
about
him
and
his
talk
may
seem
on
occasion
to
be
that
of
a
man
whom
we
know
from
outside
the
advantage
is
peculiarly
felt
on
that
crucial
occasion
at
gloriani
where
strether
sudden
flare
of
vehemence
so
natural
and
yet
so
unlike
him
breaks
out
with
force
unimpaired
it
strikes
freshly
on
the
ear
the
speech
of
a
man
whose
inmost
perturbations
we
have
indeed
inferred
from
many
glimpses
of
his
mind
but
still
without
ever
learning
the
full
tale
of
them
from
himself
the
ambassadors
then
is
a
story
which
is
seen
from
one
man
point
of
view
and
yet
a
story
in
which
that
point
of
view
is
itself
a
matter
for
the
reader
to
confront
and
to
watch
constructively
everything
in
the
novel
is
now
dramatically
rendered
whether
it
is
a
page
of
dialogue
or
a
page
of
description
because
even
in
the
page
of
description
nobody
is
addressing
us
nobody
is
reporting
his
impression
to
the
reader
the
impression
is
enacting
itself
in
the
endless
series
of
images
that
play
over
the
outspread
expanse
of
the
man
mind
and
memory
when
the
story
passes
from
these
to
the
scenes
of
dialogue
from
the
silent
drama
of
strether
meditation
to
the
spoken
drama
of
the
men
and
women
there
is
thus
no
break
in
the
method
the
same
law
rules
everywhere
that
strether
changing
sense
of
his
situation
shall
appeal
directly
to
the
onlooker
and
not
by
way
of
any
summarizing
and
yet
a
the
book
is
all
pictorial
an
indirect
impression
received
through
intervening
consciousness
beyond
which
the
story
never
strays
i
conclude
that
on
this
paradox
the
art
of
dramatizing
the
picture
of
somebody
experience
the
art
i
have
been
considering
in
these
last
chapters
touches
its
limit
there
is
indeed
no
further
for
it
to
go
xii
there
is
no
further
for
it
to
go
for
it
now
covers
the
whole
story
henry
james
was
the
first
writer
of
fiction
i
judge
to
use
all
the
possibilities
of
the
method
with
intention
and
thoroughness
and
the
full
extent
of
the
opportunity
which
is
thus
revealed
is
very
great
the
range
of
method
is
permanently
enlarged
it
is
proved
once
for
all
that
the
craft
of
fiction
has
larger
resources
than
might
have
been
suspected
before
a
novelist
in
these
days
is
handling
an
instrument
it
may
be
said
the
capacity
of
which
has
been
very
elaborately
tested
and
though
in
any
particular
case
there
may
be
good
reason
why
its
dramatic
effects
should
not
be
exhausted
the
subject
may
need
none
or
few
of
them
yet
it
must
be
supposed
that
the
novelist
is
aware
of
the
faculties
that
he
refuses
there
are
kinds
of
virtuosity
in
any
art
which
affect
the
whole
of
its
future
painting
can
never
be
the
same
again
after
some
painter
has
used
line
and
colour
in
a
manner
that
his
predecessors
had
not
fully
developed
music
makes
a
new
demand
of
all
musicians
when
one
of
them
has
once
increased
its
language
and
the
language
of
the
novel
extended
to
the
point
which
it
has
reached
gives
a
possible
scope
to
a
novelist
which
he
is
evidently
bound
to
take
into
account
it
is
a
scope
so
wide
and
so
little
explored
hitherto
that
the
novel
may
now
be
starting
upon
a
fresh
life
after
the
tremendous
career
it
has
had
already
the
discovery
of
the
degree
to
which
it
may
be
enhanced
dramatically
this
may
be
a
point
of
departure
from
which
it
will
set
out
with
vigour
renewed
perhaps
it
has
done
so
by
this
time
anyhow
it
is
clear
that
an
immense
variety
of
possible
modulations
mixtures
harmonies
of
method
yet
untried
are
open
to
it
if
it
chooses
to
avail
itself
and
i
should
imagine
that
to
a
novelist
of
entering
the
field
at
this
late
hour
the
thought
might
be
a
stimulating
one
there
is
still
so
much
to
be
done
after
a
couple
of
centuries
of
without
a
pause
there
are
experiments
to
be
made
a
novel
such
as
the
ambassadors
may
give
no
more
than
a
hint
of
the
rich
and
profound
effects
waiting
to
be
achieved
by
the
laying
of
method
upon
method
and
criticism
may
presently
be
called
on
to
analyse
the
delicate
process
much
more
closely
than
i
now
attempt
it
is
to
be
hoped
so
indeed
meanwhile
it
is
useful
to
linger
over
a
book
that
suggests
these
possibilities
and
to
mark
the
direction
in
which
they
seem
to
point
the
purpose
of
the
novelist
ingenuity
is
always
the
same
it
is
to
give
to
his
subject
the
highest
relief
by
which
it
is
capable
of
profiting
and
the
less
dramatic
strictly
speaking
the
subject
may
be
the
less
it
is
able
that
is
to
say
to
express
itself
in
action
and
in
action
only
the
more
it
is
needful
to
heighten
its
flat
pictorial
descriptive
surface
by
the
arts
of
drama
it
is
not
managed
by
peppering
the
surface
with
animated
dialogue
by
making
the
characters
break
into
talk
when
they
really
have
nothing
to
contribute
to
the
subject
the
end
of
this
is
only
to
cheapen
and
discredit
their
talk
when
at
length
it
is
absolutely
required
the
dramatic
rule
is
applied
more
fundamentally
it
animates
the
actual
elements
of
the
picture
the
description
and
makes
a
drama
of
these
i
have
noted
how
in
the
ambassadors
the
picture
of
strether
mind
is
transformed
into
an
enacted
play
even
where
his
story
for
chapters
at
a
time
is
bare
of
action
in
the
literal
sense
the
result
no
doubt
is
that
his
mind
emerges
from
the
book
with
force
and
authority
its
presence
is
and
now
i
would
track
the
same
method
and
measure
the
result
in
another
book
the
wings
of
the
dove
where
the
value
of
this
kind
of
dramatization
is
perhaps
still
more
clearly
to
be
seen
again
we
are
dealing
with
a
subject
that
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
is
entirely
undramatic
milly
the
dove
during
all
that
part
of
the
book
in
which
her
mind
lies
open
in
the
chapters
which
give
her
vision
of
the
man
and
the
girl
densher
and
kate
not
theirs
of
her
is
hoarding
in
silence
two
facts
of
profoundest
import
to
herself
one
is
her
love
for
densher
the
other
the
mortal
disease
with
which
she
is
stricken
it
is
of
these
two
facts
that
kate
proposes
to
take
advantage
and
there
is
nothing
weak
or
vague
about
kate
design
she
and
densher
are
penniless
milly
is
rich
but
they
can
afford
to
bide
their
time
and
milly
can
not
let
them
do
so
therefore
let
densher
accept
his
opportunity
and
let
him
presently
return
to
kate
well
endowed
by
the
generosity
of
an
exquisite
young
wife
dead
in
her
prime
that
is
how
milly
condition
is
to
be
turned
to
account
by
a
remarkably
young
woman
but
milly
herself
is
still
unaware
of
any
confederation
between
her
two
friends
and
she
silently
broods
over
the
struggle
in
her
mind
her
desire
for
life
her
knowledge
of
her
precarious
hold
on
life
the
chapters
i
speak
of
are
to
give
the
sense
of
this
conflict
to
show
unmistakably
the
pair
of
facts
upon
which
kate
project
is
founded
milly
has
nothing
to
in
the
story
but
she
has
to
with
great
intensity
for
it
is
on
what
she
is
that
the
story
turns
of
that
in
a
moment
however
in
these
chapters
which
are
the
central
chapters
of
the
book
milly
consciousness
is
to
the
fore
the
deep
agitation
within
her
is
the
concern
of
the
moment
once
more
it
is
the
superficial
play
of
thought
that
is
put
before
us
the
light
stir
and
vibration
of
milly
sensibility
from
hour
to
hour
is
all
we
actually
see
for
the
most
part
it
is
very
light
very
easy
and
airy
as
she
moves
with
her
odd
poetry
and
grace
and
freedom
she
comes
from
new
york
it
will
be
remembered
a
pale
angular
princess
loaded
with
millions
and
all
alone
in
the
world
save
for
her
small
companion
stringham
she
is
a
rare
and
innocent
creature
receptive
and
perceptive
thrown
into
the
middle
of
a
situation
in
which
she
sees
everything
excepting
only
the
scheme
by
which
it
is
proposed
to
make
use
of
her
of
that
she
knows
nothing
as
yet
her
troubles
are
purely
her
own
and
gradually
it
is
hard
to
say
where
or
how
we
discover
what
they
are
they
are
much
too
deeply
buried
in
her
mind
to
appear
casually
upon
the
surface
at
any
time
but
now
and
then
in
the
drama
of
her
meditation
there
is
a
strange
look
or
a
pause
or
a
sudden
hasty
motion
which
is
unexplained
which
is
portentous
which
betrays
everything
presently
her
great
hidden
facts
have
passed
into
the
possession
of
the
reader
so
to
speak
not
broken
into
detail
bit
by
bit
not
pieced
together
descriptively
but
so
implied
and
suggested
that
at
some
moment
or
other
they
spring
up
complete
and
solid
in
the
reader
attention
exactly
how
and
where
did
it
happen
turning
back
looking
over
the
pages
again
i
can
mark
the
very
point
perhaps
at
which
the
thing
was
liberated
and
i
became
possessed
of
it
i
can
see
the
word
that
finally
gave
it
to
me
but
at
the
time
it
may
easily
have
passed
unnoticed
the
enlightening
word
did
not
seem
peculiarly
emphatic
as
it
was
uttered
it
was
not
announced
with
any
particular
circumstance
and
yet
presently
there
was
the
piece
of
knowledge
that
i
had
not
possessed
before
not
to
walk
straight
up
to
the
fact
and
put
it
into
phrases
but
to
the
fact
and
so
to
detach
it
inviolate
such
is
henry
james
manner
of
dramatizing
it
soon
after
milly
first
appearance
there
are
some
pages
that
illustrate
his
procedure
very
clearly
or
very
clearly
i
should
say
when
the
clue
has
been
picked
up
and
retraced
there
is
an
hour
in
which
milly
gazes
upon
her
prospect
measuring
its
promises
and
threats
gathering
herself
for
the
effort
they
demand
she
sits
on
a
high
italian
with
a
blue
plain
spread
out
beneath
her
like
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
there
she
looks
at
her
future
with
rapt
absorption
lost
to
all
other
thought
her
mind
if
we
saw
it
would
tell
us
everything
then
at
least
she
searches
its
deepest
depth
it
is
evident
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
her
mind
should
not
be
exposed
in
that
hour
the
troubling
shapes
that
lurk
in
it
are
not
to
be
described
they
are
to
make
their
presence
known
of
their
own
accord
instead
of
intruding
upon
milly
lonely
rumination
therefore
the
author
elects
to
leave
her
to
join
company
with
her
friend
in
the
background
and
in
that
most
crucial
session
to
reveal
nothing
of
milly
but
the
glimpse
that
her
friend
catches
of
her
in
passing
the
glimpse
so
rendered
nothing
but
in
milly
attitude
while
she
sits
enthroned
above
the
world
there
is
a
certain
expression
deep
and
strange
not
to
be
missed
though
who
shall
say
exactly
what
it
implies
is
it
hope
is
it
despair
at
any
rate
the
clear
picture
of
her
remains
and
a
little
later
when
her
mind
is
visible
again
the
memory
of
her
up
there
on
the
mountain
has
quickened
the
eye
of
the
onlooker
the
images
in
her
mind
are
not
at
all
portentous
now
she
is
among
her
friends
she
is
harvesting
impressions
there
is
not
a
word
of
anything
dark
or
distressing
or
but
still
but
still
we
have
seen
milly
when
she
believed
herself
unseen
and
it
is
certain
that
there
is
more
in
her
mind
than
now
appears
and
though
she
seems
so
full
of
the
new
excitement
of
making
friends
with
kate
croy
there
must
be
some
preoccupation
beneath
and
then
in
a
flash
are
the
troubles
that
engage
her
in
solitude
that
have
ached
in
her
mind
and
yet
there
has
never
been
a
single
direct
allusion
to
them
skirting
round
and
round
them
giving
one
brief
sight
of
her
in
eloquent
circumstances
then
displaying
the
all
but
untroubled
surface
of
her
thought
on
this
side
and
that
the
author
has
encompassed
the
struggle
that
is
proceeding
within
her
and
has
lifted
it
bodily
into
the
understanding
of
the
reader
the
profit
which
the
story
gains
from
this
treatment
is
easily
recognized
solidity
weight
a
third
dimension
is
given
to
the
impression
of
milly
unhappy
case
mere
emphasis
a
simple
underlining
of
plain
words
could
never
produce
the
same
effect
what
is
needed
is
some
method
which
will
enable
an
onlooker
to
see
round
the
object
to
left
and
right
as
far
as
possible
just
as
with
two
eyes
stereoscopically
we
shape
and
solidify
the
flat
impression
of
a
sphere
by
such
a
method
the
image
will
be
so
raised
out
of
its
setting
that
the
stream
of
vision
will
wash
it
on
either
side
leaving
no
doubt
of
its
substantial
form
and
so
dealing
with
the
case
of
milly
henry
james
proceeds
to
cut
behind
it
lavishing
his
care
on
any
but
its
chief
and
most
memorable
aspect
that
may
wait
meanwhile
the
momentary
flutter
of
her
nerves
and
fancies
is
closely
noted
wherever
her
life
touches
the
lives
about
her
or
the
few
of
them
that
are
part
of
her
story
the
play
draws
a
steady
curve
around
the
subject
in
the
midst
more
and
more
of
this
outer
rim
of
her
consciousness
moves
into
sight
she
is
seen
in
the
company
of
the
different
people
who
affect
her
nearly
but
in
all
their
intercourse
the
real
burden
of
her
story
is
veiled
under
the
trembling
wavering
delicacy
of
her
immediate
thought
her
manner
of
living
and
thinking
and
feeling
in
the
moment
is
thus
revealed
in
a
wide
sweep
and
at
last
the
process
is
complete
her
case
is
set
free
stands
out
and
casts
its
shadow
these
difficulties
these
hopes
and
fears
that
have
been
buried
in
silence
are
all
included
in
the
sphere
of
experience
which
the
author
has
rounded
and
by
leaving
them
where
they
lie
he
has
given
us
a
sense
of
their
substance
of
the
space
they
occupy
which
we
could
not
have
acquired
from
a
straight
square
account
of
them
milly
desired
to
live
she
had
every
reason
in
the
world
for
so
desiring
and
she
knew
vaguely
at
first
then
with
certainty
that
she
had
no
life
to
hope
for
it
is
a
deep
agitation
which
is
never
at
rest
it
is
far
out
of
sight
but
its
influence
spreads
in
every
direction
and
here
and
there
it
must
touch
the
surface
even
one
upon
which
appearances
are
maintained
so
valiantly
and
if
the
surface
which
is
all
we
know
is
thus
high
above
the
depths
and
yet
there
are
instants
when
it
is
just
perceptibly
disturbed
by
things
unseen
is
it
not
proved
as
it
could
be
proved
in
no
other
way
how
active
and
forcible
they
must
be
by
no
picture
of
them
but
by
an
enactment
of
their
remotest
manifestations
that
is
how
their
strength
their
bulk
their
range
in
a
harassed
existence
is
represented
such
is
the
object
gained
by
the
method
of
dramatization
applied
in
this
way
as
with
strether
to
the
story
of
a
mind
milly
case
which
seemed
to
be
as
pictorial
as
little
dramatic
as
could
be
since
it
is
all
a
condition
and
a
situation
to
be
portrayed
not
an
action
has
been
turned
into
drama
the
advantages
of
drama
have
been
annexed
on
its
behalf
there
is
no
action
properly
speaking
and
yet
the
story
of
her
troubles
has
acted
itself
before
our
eyes
as
we
followed
the
transient
expression
of
her
mood
and
now
look
at
a
single
scene
later
on
when
the
issue
of
situation
has
at
last
been
precipitated
look
for
example
at
the
scene
in
which
good
susan
stringham
her
faithful
companion
visits
densher
in
his
venetian
lodging
on
an
evening
of
wild
autumn
rain
to
make
a
last
and
great
appeal
to
him
an
appeal
for
what
milly
in
her
palace
hard
by
lies
stricken
she
has
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
the
vision
of
hope
which
had
supported
her
is
at
an
end
not
by
reason
of
her
mere
mortal
illness
but
because
of
some
other
blow
which
has
fallen
susan
knows
what
it
is
and
densher
is
to
learn
till
lately
milly
was
living
in
ignorance
of
the
plot
woven
about
her
the
masterly
design
to
make
use
of
her
in
order
that
densher
and
kate
croy
may
come
together
in
the
end
the
design
was
kate
from
the
first
densher
has
been
much
less
resolute
but
kate
was
prepared
to
see
it
through
conceal
from
milly
that
an
old
engagement
holds
between
her
two
friends
persuade
her
that
neither
has
any
interest
in
the
other
and
all
will
go
well
milly
believing
in
densher
candour
will
fall
into
the
plot
and
enjoy
her
brief
happiness
it
can
not
be
more
than
brief
for
milly
is
certainly
doomed
but
when
she
dies
and
densher
is
free
for
kate
again
who
will
be
the
worse
for
the
fraud
milly
will
have
had
what
she
wants
her
two
friends
will
have
helped
themselves
in
helping
her
so
kate
argues
plausibly
but
it
all
depends
on
keeping
poor
exquisite
milly
safely
in
the
dark
if
she
should
discover
that
kate
and
densher
are
in
league
to
profit
by
her
it
would
be
a
sharper
stroke
than
the
discovery
of
her
malady
and
by
this
autumn
evening
when
susan
stringham
appears
before
densher
milly
discovered
has
learned
that
she
has
been
tricked
has
lost
her
desire
of
life
has
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
susan
appears
big
with
the
motive
that
has
brought
her
this
visit
of
hers
is
an
appeal
to
densher
so
much
is
clear
in
all
her
looks
and
tones
there
is
only
one
way
to
save
milly
to
restore
to
milly
not
indeed
her
life
but
her
desire
of
it
densher
has
it
in
his
power
to
make
her
wish
to
live
again
and
that
is
all
that
he
or
any
one
else
could
achieve
for
her
the
thought
is
between
him
and
the
good
woman
as
they
talk
the
dialogue
with
its
allusions
and
broken
phrases
slowly
shapes
itself
to
the
form
of
the
suppressed
appeal
it
hangs
in
the
air
almost
visibly
before
it
is
uttered
at
all
and
by
that
time
a
word
is
enough
one
stroke
and
the
nature
of
the
appeal
and
all
its
implications
are
in
view
the
scene
has
embodied
it
the
cheerless
little
room
and
the
falling
light
and
densher
uneasy
movements
and
susan
flushed
earnestness
have
all
contributed
the
broken
phrases
without
touching
it
have
travelled
about
it
and
revealed
its
contour
densher
might
tell
milly
that
she
is
wrong
might
convince
her
that
he
and
kate
have
not
beguiled
and
misled
her
as
she
supposes
densher
in
other
words
might
mislead
her
again
and
stringham
entreats
him
to
do
so
that
is
why
she
has
come
and
such
is
the
image
which
has
been
gradually
created
and
which
at
last
is
actual
and
palpable
in
the
scene
it
has
not
appeared
as
a
statement
or
an
announcement
susan
appeal
and
densher
tormented
response
to
it
are
establishing
their
presence
as
matters
which
the
reader
has
lived
with
for
the
time
they
have
emerged
out
of
the
surface
of
the
scene
into
form
and
relief
and
finally
the
subject
of
the
whole
book
is
rendered
in
the
same
way
the
subject
is
not
in
milly
herself
but
in
her
effect
upon
the
relation
existing
between
densher
and
kate
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
these
two
are
closely
allied
and
by
the
end
their
understanding
has
been
crossed
by
something
that
has
changed
it
for
ever
milly
has
come
and
gone
nothing
is
afterwards
the
same
their
scheme
has
been
successful
for
milly
in
dying
has
bequeathed
a
fortune
to
densher
but
also
she
has
bequeathed
the
memory
of
her
last
signal
to
them
which
was
one
that
neither
could
foresee
and
which
the
man
at
any
rate
could
never
forget
for
densher
had
practised
that
final
disloyalty
which
was
begged
of
him
and
milly
had
died
in
full
knowledge
of
their
design
and
yet
she
had
forgiven
to
the
end
and
her
forgiveness
stands
between
them
kate
recognizes
it
in
the
word
on
which
the
book
closes
we
shall
never
be
again
as
we
were
whether
they
accept
the
situation
whether
they
try
to
patch
up
their
old
alliance
these
questions
are
no
affair
of
the
story
with
kate
word
the
story
is
finished
the
first
fineness
of
their
association
is
lost
nothing
will
restore
it
milly
has
made
the
change
by
being
what
she
was
too
rare
an
essence
for
vulgar
uses
those
who
wanted
the
intelligence
to
understand
her
must
pay
their
penalty
at
least
they
are
intelligent
enough
to
see
it
it
is
once
more
the
picture
of
a
moral
emotional
revolution
the
kind
of
subject
that
seems
to
demand
a
narrator
the
story
is
so
little
a
matter
of
action
that
when
the
revolution
is
complete
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
its
result
in
action
is
indifferent
the
man
and
the
woman
may
marry
or
part
the
subject
is
unaffected
either
way
the
progress
of
the
tale
lies
in
the
consciousness
of
the
people
in
it
and
somebody
is
needed
it
might
have
been
supposed
to
tell
us
how
it
all
came
to
pass
not
the
author
perhaps
or
any
of
the
characters
in
person
but
at
least
it
must
be
told
at
any
given
juncture
from
somebody
point
of
view
composing
and
reflecting
the
story
of
an
experience
but
in
the
wings
of
the
dove
there
is
next
to
no
narrative
at
all
strictly
speaking
who
is
there
that
narrates
the
author
a
little
it
is
true
for
the
people
have
to
be
described
placed
brought
on
the
scene
to
begin
with
but
afterwards
densher
kate
milly
susan
stringham
each
in
turn
to
take
up
the
story
and
to
provide
the
point
of
view
and
where
it
is
absolutely
needful
they
really
do
so
they
give
the
mirror
for
the
visible
scene
about
them
alpine
heights
london
streets
venetian
palaces
but
that
is
incidental
of
the
progress
of
the
tale
they
offer
no
account
they
it
and
not
only
in
their
spoken
words
but
also
and
much
more
in
the
silent
drama
that
is
perpetually
going
forward
within
them
they
do
not
describe
and
review
and
recapitulate
this
drama
nor
does
the
author
it
is
played
before
us
we
see
its
actual
movement
the
effect
is
found
here
and
there
in
all
fiction
of
course
the
undercutting
as
i
call
it
of
a
flat
impression
is
seen
wherever
a
turn
of
events
is
carefully
prepared
and
deliberately
approached
but
i
do
not
know
that
anywhere
except
in
the
later
novels
of
henry
james
a
pictorial
subject
is
thus
handed
over
in
its
entirety
to
the
method
of
drama
so
that
the
intervention
of
a
seeing
eye
and
a
recording
hand
between
the
reader
and
the
subject
is
practically
avoided
altogether
i
take
it
as
evident
that
unless
the
presence
of
a
seer
and
a
recorder
is
made
a
value
in
itself
contributing
definitely
to
the
effect
of
the
subject
he
is
better
dispensed
with
and
put
out
of
the
way
where
other
things
are
equal
a
direct
view
of
the
matter
in
hand
is
the
best
but
it
has
been
made
clear
in
the
foregoing
pages
i
hope
that
the
uses
of
a
narrator
are
many
and
various
other
things
are
equal
where
the
subject
asks
for
no
more
than
to
be
reflected
and
pictured
in
that
case
the
narrator
standing
in
front
of
the
story
is
in
a
position
to
make
the
most
of
it
all
that
can
be
made
and
so
he
represents
the
great
principle
of
economy
and
is
a
value
in
himself
and
does
contribute
to
the
effect
many
a
story
from
the
large
panoramic
chronicle
to
the
small
and
single
impression
postulates
the
the
and
by
that
method
gives
its
best
speaking
in
person
or
reported
obliquely
the
narrator
serves
his
turn
but
where
there
is
no
positive
reason
for
him
there
is
a
reason
equally
positive
for
a
different
method
one
that
assigns
the
point
of
view
to
the
reader
himself
an
undramatic
subject
we
find
can
be
treated
dramatically
so
that
the
different
method
is
at
hand
the
story
that
is
concerned
even
entirely
concerned
with
the
impact
of
experience
upon
a
mind
strether
say
can
be
enhanced
to
the
pitch
of
drama
because
thought
has
its
gestures
and
its
speaking
looks
just
as
much
as
an
actor
on
the
stage
make
use
of
these
looks
and
gestures
express
the
story
through
them
leave
them
to
enact
it
and
you
have
a
story
which
in
its
manner
is
effectually
drama
method
upon
method
the
vision
a
vision
the
process
of
thinking
and
feeling
and
seeing
exposed
objectively
to
the
view
of
the
reader
it
is
an
ingenious
art
criticism
seems
to
have
paid
it
less
attention
than
it
deserves
but
criticism
has
been
hindered
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
these
books
of
henry
james
in
which
the
art
is
written
large
are
so
odd
and
so
personal
and
so
peculiar
in
all
their
aspects
when
the
whole
volume
is
full
of
a
idiosyncrasy
quite
unlike
that
of
anyone
else
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
this
which
is
solely
the
author
and
his
method
of
treating
a
story
which
is
a
general
question
discussible
apart
and
thus
it
happens
that
the
novelist
who
carried
his
research
into
the
theory
of
the
art
further
than
any
other
the
only
real
in
the
art
is
the
novelist
whose
methods
are
most
likely
to
be
overlooked
or
mistaken
regarded
as
simply
a
part
of
his
own
original
quiddity
it
should
be
possible
to
isolate
them
to
separate
them
in
thought
from
the
temperament
by
which
they
were
coloured
they
belong
to
the
craft
which
belongs
to
no
man
in
particular
they
still
wait
to
be
fully
assimilated
into
the
criticism
of
fiction
there
is
much
more
in
them
no
doubt
than
the
few
points
that
i
touch
on
here
but
i
pass
on
to
one
or
two
of
the
rest
xiii
what
then
is
a
dramatic
subject
hitherto
i
have
been
speaking
of
novels
in
which
some
point
of
view
other
than
that
of
the
reader
the
impartial
onlooker
is
prescribed
by
the
subject
in
hand
in
big
chronicles
like
thackeray
it
is
clear
that
the
controlling
point
of
view
can
only
be
that
of
the
chronicler
himself
or
of
some
one
whom
he
sets
up
to
tell
the
story
on
his
behalf
the
expanse
of
life
which
the
story
covers
is
far
too
great
to
be
shown
to
the
reader
in
a
series
of
purely
dramatic
scenes
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
author
or
his
spokesman
to
draw
back
for
a
general
view
of
the
matter
from
time
to
time
and
whenever
he
does
so
the
story
becomes
impression
summarized
and
pictured
for
the
reader
in
esmond
or
the
virginians
or
the
newcomes
there
are
tracts
and
tracts
of
the
story
which
are
bound
to
remain
outside
the
reader
direct
vision
only
a
limited
number
of
scenes
and
occasions
could
possibly
be
set
forth
in
the
form
of
drama
a
large
loose
manifold
subject
in
short
extensive
in
time
and
space
full
of
crowds
and
diversions
is
a
pictorial
subject
and
can
be
nothing
else
however
intensely
it
may
be
dramatized
here
and
there
on
the
whole
it
must
be
presented
as
a
conspectus
the
angle
of
vision
being
assigned
to
the
narrator
it
is
simply
a
question
of
amount
of
quantity
of
the
reach
of
the
subject
if
it
passes
a
certain
point
it
exceeds
the
capacity
of
the
straight
and
dramatic
method
madame
bovary
and
the
ambassadors
again
are
undramatic
in
their
matter
though
their
reach
is
comparatively
small
for
in
both
of
them
the
emphasis
falls
upon
changes
of
mind
heart
character
gradually
drawn
out
not
upon
any
clash
or
opposition
resolved
in
action
they
be
treated
scenically
no
doubt
their
authors
might
conceivably
have
handled
them
in
terms
of
pure
drama
without
any
direct
display
of
emma
secret
fancies
or
strether
brooding
imagination
but
in
neither
case
could
that
method
make
the
most
of
the
subject
or
bring
out
all
that
it
has
to
give
the
most
expressive
most
enlightening
part
of
strether
story
lies
in
the
reverberating
theatre
of
his
mind
and
as
for
emma
the
small
exterior
facts
of
her
story
are
of
very
slight
account
both
these
books
therefore
in
their
general
lines
are
pictured
impressions
not
actions
even
though
in
bovary
to
some
extent
and
in
the
ambassadors
almost
wholly
the
picture
is
itself
dramatized
in
the
fashion
i
have
indicated
that
last
effect
belongs
only
to
the
final
method
the
treatment
of
the
surface
underneath
it
there
is
in
both
the
projection
of
a
certain
person
point
of
view
but
now
look
at
the
contrast
in
the
awkward
age
a
novel
in
which
henry
james
followed
a
single
method
throughout
from
top
to
bottom
denying
himself
the
help
of
any
other
he
chose
to
treat
this
story
as
pure
drama
he
never
once
draws
upon
the
characteristic
resource
of
the
novelist
who
is
able
as
the
dramatist
is
not
able
to
give
a
generalized
and
foreshortened
account
of
the
matter
in
hand
in
the
awkward
age
everything
is
immediate
and
particular
there
is
no
insight
into
anybody
thought
no
survey
of
the
scene
from
a
height
no
resumption
of
the
past
in
retrospect
the
whole
of
the
book
passes
scenically
before
the
reader
and
nothing
is
offered
but
the
look
and
the
speech
of
the
characters
on
a
series
of
chosen
occasions
it
might
indeed
be
printed
as
a
play
whatever
is
not
dialogue
is
simply
a
kind
of
amplified
adding
to
the
dialogue
the
expressive
effect
which
might
be
given
it
by
good
acting
the
novelist
using
this
method
claims
only
one
advantage
over
the
playwright
it
is
the
advantage
of
ensuring
the
very
best
acting
imaginable
a
performance
in
which
every
actor
is
a
perfect
artist
and
not
the
least
point
is
ever
missed
the
play
is
not
handed
over
to
the
chances
of
interpretation
that
is
the
difference
the
author
creates
the
manner
in
which
the
words
are
spoken
as
well
as
the
words
themselves
and
he
may
keep
the
manner
at
an
ideal
pitch
otherwise
the
novelist
completely
ties
his
hands
submitting
to
all
the
restraints
of
the
playwright
in
order
to
secure
the
compactness
and
the
direct
force
of
true
drama
what
is
the
issue
of
a
certain
conjunction
of
circumstances
the
subject
of
the
book
is
in
the
question
first
of
all
we
see
a
highly
sophisticated
circle
of
men
and
women
who
seem
so
well
practised
in
the
art
of
living
that
they
could
never
be
taken
by
surprise
life
in
their
hands
has
been
refined
to
a
process
in
which
nothing
appears
to
have
been
left
to
chance
their
intelligence
accounts
for
everything
they
know
where
they
are
they
know
what
they
want
and
under
a
network
of
discretion
which
they
all
sustain
they
thoroughly
understand
each
other
it
is
a
charmed
world
altogether
occupying
a
corner
of
modern
london
it
is
carefully
protected
within
and
without
and
yet
oddly
enough
there
is
one
quite
common
and
regular
contingency
for
which
it
is
not
prepared
at
all
its
handling
of
life
proceeds
smoothly
so
long
as
all
the
men
and
women
together
are
on
a
level
of
proficiency
all
alike
experienced
in
the
art
and
they
can
guard
themselves
against
intruders
from
elsewhere
but
periodically
it
must
happen
that
their
young
grow
up
the
daughter
of
the
house
reaches
the
awkward
age
becomes
suddenly
too
old
for
the
and
joins
her
elders
below
then
comes
the
difficulty
there
is
an
interval
in
which
she
is
still
too
young
for
the
freedom
of
her
elders
style
and
it
looks
as
though
she
might
disconcert
them
not
a
little
sitting
there
with
wide
eyes
do
they
simply
disregard
her
and
continue
their
game
as
before
do
they
try
to
adapt
their
style
to
her
inexperience
apparently
they
have
no
theory
of
their
proper
course
the
difficulty
seems
to
strike
them
afresh
every
time
that
it
recurs
in
other
such
worlds
not
of
modern
london
it
is
foreseen
and
provided
for
the
young
woman
is
married
and
launched
at
once
there
is
no
awkward
age
but
here
and
now
or
rather
here
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
makes
a
real
little
situation
and
this
is
the
subject
of
henry
james
book
it
is
clearly
dramatic
it
is
a
situation
raising
the
question
of
its
issue
and
by
answering
the
question
the
subject
is
treated
what
will
these
people
do
how
will
they
circumvent
this
awkwardness
that
is
what
the
book
is
to
show
action
essentially
not
the
picture
of
a
character
or
a
state
of
mind
mind
and
character
enter
into
it
of
course
as
soon
as
the
situation
is
particularized
the
girl
becomes
an
individual
with
her
own
outlook
her
own
way
of
reaching
a
conclusion
and
her
point
of
view
must
then
be
understood
but
whatever
it
may
be
it
does
not
constitute
the
situation
that
is
there
in
advance
it
exists
in
general
and
the
girl
comes
upon
the
scene
like
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
book
to
illustrate
it
the
subject
of
the
book
lies
in
their
behaviour
there
are
no
gradual
processes
of
change
and
development
to
be
watched
in
their
minds
it
is
their
action
that
is
significant
by
clever
management
the
author
can
avoid
the
necessity
of
looking
inside
their
motives
these
are
betrayed
by
visible
and
audible
signs
the
story
proceeds
in
the
open
point
by
point
from
one
scene
to
another
it
shows
its
curve
and
resolves
the
situation
and
very
ironic
and
pleasing
and
unexpected
the
resolution
proves
it
takes
everybody
by
surprise
no
one
notices
what
is
happening
till
it
is
over
but
it
begins
to
happen
from
the
start
the
girl
nanda
supposably
a
helpless
spectator
takes
control
of
the
situation
and
works
it
out
for
her
elders
she
is
the
intelligent
and
expert
and
one
of
them
all
they
have
only
to
leave
everything
to
her
light
manipulation
and
the
awkwardness
which
is
theirs
not
hers
is
surmounted
by
the
time
she
has
displayed
all
her
art
the
story
is
at
an
end
her
action
has
answered
the
question
and
provided
the
issue
the
theme
of
the
book
being
what
it
is
an
action
merely
and
an
action
strictly
limited
in
its
scope
it
requires
no
narrator
in
a
dozen
scenes
or
so
the
characters
may
set
it
forth
on
their
own
account
and
we
have
only
to
look
on
nobody
need
stand
by
and
expound
the
situation
involves
no
more
than
a
small
company
of
people
and
there
is
no
reason
for
them
to
straggle
far
in
space
or
time
on
the
contrary
the
compactness
of
the
situation
is
one
of
its
special
marks
its
point
is
that
it
belongs
to
a
little
organized
circle
a
incident
in
their
lives
and
since
the
root
of
the
matter
is
in
their
behaviour
in
the
manner
in
which
they
meet
or
fail
to
meet
the
incident
their
behaviour
will
sufficiently
express
what
is
in
their
minds
it
is
not
as
though
the
theme
of
the
story
lay
in
some
slow
revulsion
or
displacement
of
mood
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
understand
before
its
issue
in
action
could
be
appreciated
what
do
they
that
is
the
immediate
question
what
they
think
and
feel
is
a
matter
that
is
entirely
implied
in
the
answer
obviously
that
was
not
at
all
the
case
with
strether
the
workings
of
his
imagination
spread
over
far
more
ground
ramified
infinitely
further
than
anything
that
he
his
action
depended
upon
his
view
of
things
and
logically
flowed
from
it
but
his
action
by
itself
would
give
no
measure
at
all
of
his
inner
life
with
the
people
of
the
awkward
age
on
the
other
hand
their
action
fully
covers
their
motives
and
sentiments
or
can
be
made
to
do
so
by
the
care
of
a
dexterous
author
and
so
the
story
can
be
rendered
with
absolute
consistency
on
one
method
only
if
the
author
chooses
and
he
does
so
choose
and
the
awkward
age
rounds
off
the
argument
i
have
sought
to
unwind
the
sequence
of
method
and
method
each
one
in
turn
pushing
its
way
towards
a
completer
dramatization
of
the
story
here
at
any
rate
is
one
book
in
which
a
subject
capable
of
acting
itself
out
from
beginning
to
end
is
made
to
do
so
one
novel
in
which
method
becomes
as
consistent
and
homogeneous
as
it
ever
may
in
fiction
no
other
manner
of
telling
a
story
can
be
quite
so
true
to
itself
for
whereas
drama
in
this
book
depends
not
at
all
upon
the
author
word
of
honour
and
deals
entirely
with
immediate
facts
the
most
undramatic
piece
of
fiction
can
hardly
for
long
be
consistent
in
its
own
line
but
must
seek
the
support
of
scenic
presentation
has
anyone
tried
to
write
a
novel
in
which
there
should
be
no
dialogue
no
immediate
scene
nothing
at
all
but
a
diffused
and
purely
subjective
impression
such
a
novel
if
it
existed
would
be
a
counterpart
to
the
awkward
age
just
as
henry
james
book
never
deviates
from
the
straight
square
view
of
the
passing
event
so
the
other
would
be
exclusively
oblique
general
retrospective
a
meditation
upon
the
past
bringing
nothing
into
the
foreground
dramatizing
nothing
in
talk
or
action
the
visionary
fiction
of
walter
pater
keeps
as
nearly
to
a
method
of
that
kind
i
suppose
as
fiction
could
in
marius
probably
if
it
is
to
be
called
a
novel
the
art
of
drama
is
renounced
as
thoroughly
as
it
has
ever
occurred
to
a
novelist
to
dispense
with
it
i
scarcely
think
that
marius
ever
speaks
or
is
spoken
to
audibly
in
the
whole
course
of
the
book
such
at
least
is
the
impression
that
it
leaves
the
scenes
of
the
story
reach
the
reader
by
refraction
as
it
were
through
the
medium
of
pater
harmonious
murmur
but
scenes
they
must
be
not
even
pater
at
his
dreamiest
can
tell
a
story
without
incident
particularized
and
caught
in
the
act
when
marius
takes
a
journey
visits
a
philosopher
or
enters
a
church
the
event
stands
out
of
the
past
and
makes
an
appeal
to
the
eye
is
presented
as
it
takes
place
and
this
is
a
movement
in
the
direction
of
drama
even
if
it
goes
no
further
pater
musing
over
the
life
of
his
hero
all
but
lost
in
the
general
sentiment
of
its
grace
and
virtue
is
arrested
by
the
definite
images
of
certain
hours
and
occasions
the
flow
of
his
rumination
is
interrupted
while
he
pauses
upon
these
to
make
them
visible
they
must
be
given
a
kind
of
objectivity
some
slight
relief
against
the
dim
background
no
in
short
can
use
a
manner
as
strictly
subjective
as
purely
personal
as
the
manner
of
the
awkward
age
is
the
reverse
but
as
for
this
book
it
not
only
ends
one
argument
it
is
also
a
that
begins
another
for
when
we
have
seen
how
fiction
gradually
aspires
to
the
weight
and
authority
of
the
thing
acted
purposely
limiting
its
own
discursive
freedom
it
remains
to
see
how
it
resumes
its
freedom
when
there
is
good
cause
for
doing
so
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
the
awkward
age
is
as
lonely
as
it
seems
to
be
in
its
kind
i
have
seized
upon
it
as
an
example
of
the
dramatic
method
pursued
and
it
is
very
convenient
for
criticism
that
it
happens
to
be
there
the
book
points
a
sound
moral
with
clear
effect
but
when
it
is
time
to
suggest
that
even
in
dealing
with
a
subject
entirely
dramatic
a
novelist
may
well
find
reason
to
keep
to
his
old
familiar
mixed
method
it
would
appear
that
he
does
so
invariably
where
are
the
other
awkward
ages
the
many
that
we
might
expect
if
the
value
of
drama
is
so
great
i
dare
say
one
might
discover
a
number
of
small
things
short
dramatic
pieces
i
have
mentioned
the
case
of
maupassant
which
would
satisfy
the
requirement
but
on
the
scale
of
henry
james
book
i
know
of
nothing
else
plenty
of
people
find
their
theme
in
matters
of
action
matters
of
incident
like
the
story
of
nanda
it
is
strange
that
they
should
not
sometimes
choose
to
treat
it
with
strict
consistency
how
is
one
to
assert
a
principle
which
is
apparently
supported
by
only
one
book
in
a
thousand
thousand
i
think
it
must
be
concluded
in
the
first
place
that
to
treat
a
subject
with
the
rigour
of
henry
james
is
extremely
difficult
and
that
the
practice
of
the
thousand
thousand
is
partly
to
be
explained
by
this
fact
perhaps
many
of
them
would
be
more
dramatically
inclined
if
the
way
were
easier
it
must
always
be
simpler
for
a
to
use
his
omniscience
to
dive
into
the
minds
of
his
people
for
an
explanation
of
their
acts
than
to
make
them
so
act
that
no
such
explanation
is
ever
needed
or
perhaps
the
state
of
criticism
may
be
to
blame
with
its
long
indifference
to
these
questions
of
theory
or
perhaps
to
say
all
there
is
no
very
lively
interest
in
them
even
among
novelists
anyhow
we
may
say
from
experience
that
a
novel
is
more
likely
to
fall
below
its
proper
dramatic
pitch
than
to
strain
beyond
it
in
most
of
the
books
around
us
there
is
an
reliance
on
a
narrator
of
some
kind
a
showman
who
is
behind
the
scenes
of
the
story
and
can
tell
us
all
about
it
he
seems
to
come
forward
in
many
a
case
without
doing
the
story
any
particular
service
sometimes
he
actually
embarrasses
it
when
a
matter
of
vivid
drama
is
violently
forced
into
the
form
of
a
narration
one
can
only
suspect
that
he
then
exists
for
the
convenience
of
the
author
it
helpful
to
be
able
to
say
what
you
like
about
the
characters
and
their
doings
in
the
book
it
may
be
very
troublesome
to
make
their
doings
as
expressive
as
they
might
be
eloquent
enough
to
need
no
comment
yet
to
see
the
issue
slowly
unfolding
and
flowering
out
of
the
middle
of
a
situation
and
to
watch
it
emerge
unaided
with
everything
that
it
has
to
say
said
by
the
very
lines
and
masses
of
its
structure
this
is
surely
an
experience
apart
for
a
with
its
completeness
and
cleanness
and
its
hard
pure
edge
it
is
always
memorable
it
fills
the
mind
so
acceptably
that
a
might
be
ready
and
eager
to
aspire
to
this
effect
one
would
think
whenever
his
matter
gives
him
the
chance
again
and
again
i
have
wished
to
silence
the
voice
of
the
spokesman
who
is
supposed
to
be
helping
me
to
a
right
appreciation
of
the
matter
in
hand
the
author
or
his
creature
who
knows
so
much
and
who
pours
out
his
information
over
the
subject
and
who
talks
and
talks
about
an
issue
that
might
be
revealing
itself
without
him
the
spokesman
has
his
way
too
often
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
the
instant
authority
of
drama
is
neglected
it
is
the
day
of
the
narrator
striding
from
volume
to
volume
as
tirelessly
as
the
scudéries
and
calprenèdes
of
old
and
it
is
true
no
doubt
that
the
novel
in
all
languages
too
it
would
seem
is
more
than
ever
inclined
to
the
big
pictorial
subject
which
requires
the
voluble
chronicler
but
still
it
must
happen
occasionally
that
a
novelist
prefers
a
dramatic
motive
and
might
cast
it
into
a
round
sound
action
and
leave
it
in
that
form
if
he
chose
here
again
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
enterprise
and
experiment
in
fiction
even
now
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
is
more
in
the
general
unwillingness
of
to
entrust
the
story
to
the
people
in
it
there
is
more
than
i
have
said
if
they
are
much
less
dramatic
than
they
might
be
still
it
is
not
to
be
asserted
that
a
subject
will
often
find
perfect
expression
through
the
uncompromising
method
of
the
awkward
age
that
book
itself
perhaps
suggests
if
it
does
no
more
than
suggest
that
drama
can
not
always
do
everything
in
a
novel
even
where
the
heart
of
the
story
seems
to
lie
in
its
action
the
story
of
nanda
drops
neatly
into
scenic
form
that
is
obvious
it
is
well
adapted
for
treatment
as
a
row
of
detached
episodes
or
occasions
through
which
the
subject
is
slowly
developed
but
it
is
a
question
whether
a
story
which
requires
and
postulates
such
a
very
particular
background
so
singular
and
so
artificial
is
reasonably
denied
the
licence
to
make
its
background
as
effective
as
possible
by
whatever
means
nanda
world
is
not
the
kind
of
society
that
can
be
taken
for
granted
it
is
not
modernity
in
general
it
is
a
small
and
very
definite
tract
for
the
purposes
of
her
story
it
is
important
that
her
setting
should
be
clearly
seen
and
known
and
the
method
of
telling
her
story
must
evidently
take
this
into
account
nanda
and
her
case
are
not
rendered
if
the
quality
of
the
civilization
round
her
is
left
in
any
way
doubtful
and
it
happens
to
be
a
very
odd
quality
indeed
henry
james
decided
i
suppose
that
it
was
sufficiently
implied
in
the
action
of
his
book
and
needed
nothing
more
nanda
little
world
would
be
descried
behind
the
scene
without
any
further
picturing
he
may
have
been
right
so
far
as
the
awkward
age
is
concerned
the
behaviour
of
the
people
in
the
story
is
certainly
packed
with
many
meanings
and
perhaps
it
is
vivid
enough
to
enact
the
general
character
of
their
lives
and
ways
as
well
as
their
situation
in
the
foreground
perhaps
the
charmed
circle
of
brookenham
and
her
wonderful
crew
is
given
all
the
effect
that
is
needed
but
the
question
brings
me
to
a
clear
limitation
of
drama
on
the
whole
and
that
is
why
i
raise
it
here
is
a
difficulty
to
which
the
dramatic
method
in
its
full
severity
is
not
specially
accommodated
one
that
is
not
in
the
line
of
its
strength
to
many
of
the
difficulties
of
fiction
as
we
have
seen
it
brings
precisely
the
right
instrument
it
gives
validity
gives
direct
force
to
a
story
and
to
do
so
is
its
particular
property
for
placing
and
establishing
a
piece
of
action
it
is
paramount
but
where
it
is
not
only
a
matter
of
placing
the
action
in
view
but
of
relating
it
to
its
surroundings
strict
drama
is
at
once
at
a
disadvantage
the
seeing
eye
of
the
author
which
can
sweep
broadly
and
generalize
the
sense
of
what
it
sees
will
meet
this
difficulty
more
naturally
drama
reinforcing
and
intensifying
picture
we
have
already
seen
again
and
again
and
now
the
process
is
reversed
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
reader
the
spectator
of
the
show
the
dramatic
scene
is
vivid
and
compact
but
it
is
narrow
it
can
have
no
great
depth
and
the
colour
of
the
atmosphere
can
hardly
tell
within
the
space
it
is
likely
therefore
that
unless
this
close
direct
vision
is
supplemented
by
a
wider
survey
fronting
the
story
from
a
more
distant
point
of
view
the
background
of
the
action
the
manner
of
life
from
which
it
springs
will
fail
to
make
its
full
impression
it
amounts
to
this
that
the
and
with
it
fiction
that
is
purely
dramatic
in
its
method
is
hampered
in
its
power
to
express
the
outlying
associations
of
its
scene
it
express
them
of
course
in
clever
hands
it
may
seem
to
do
so
as
thoroughly
as
any
descriptive
narration
but
necessarily
it
does
so
with
far
more
expense
of
effort
than
the
faculty
which
lies
in
the
hand
of
the
novelist
and
that
is
in
general
a
good
reason
why
the
prudent
novelist
with
all
his
tendency
to
shed
his
privileges
still
clings
to
this
one
it
is
possible
to
imagine
that
a
novel
might
be
as
bare
of
all
background
as
a
play
of
racine
there
might
be
a
story
in
which
any
hint
of
continuous
life
proceeding
behind
the
action
would
simply
confuse
and
distort
the
right
effect
one
thinks
of
the
story
of
the
princesse
de
clèves
floating
serenely
in
the
void
without
a
sign
of
any
visible
support
from
a
furnished
world
and
there
no
doubt
nothing
would
be
gained
by
bringing
the
lucid
action
to
ground
and
fixing
it
in
its
setting
it
is
a
drama
of
sentiment
needing
only
to
be
embodied
in
characters
as
far
as
possible
detached
from
any
pictured
surroundings
with
nothing
but
the
tradition
of
fine
manners
that
is
inherent
in
their
grand
names
but
wherever
the
effect
of
the
action
depends
upon
its
time
and
place
a
novelist
naturally
turns
to
the
obvious
method
if
there
is
no
clear
reason
for
refusing
it
in
the
awkward
age
to
look
back
at
it
once
more
it
may
be
that
there
is
such
a
reason
the
beauty
of
its
resolute
consistency
is
of
course
a
value
in
itself
and
it
may
be
great
enough
to
justify
a
de
but
a
de
it
is
when
a
novelist
seeks
to
render
the
general
life
of
his
story
in
the
particular
action
and
in
the
action
alone
for
his
power
to
support
the
drama
pictorially
is
always
there
if
he
likes
to
make
use
of
it
xiv
since
he
practically
always
does
so
readily
enough
it
may
seem
unnecessary
to
insist
upon
the
matter
not
often
have
we
seen
a
novelist
pushing
his
beyond
reason
rejecting
the
easy
way
for
the
difficult
without
good
cause
but
in
order
to
make
sure
of
breaking
a
sound
rule
at
the
right
point
and
not
before
to
take
advantage
of
laxity
when
strictness
becomes
unrewarding
and
only
then
it
is
as
well
to
work
both
ways
from
the
easy
extreme
to
the
difficult
and
back
again
the
difficult
extreme
in
fiction
is
the
dramatic
rule
absolute
and
unmitigated
having
reached
it
from
the
other
end
having
begun
with
the
pictorial
summary
and
proceeded
from
thence
to
drama
we
face
the
same
stages
reversed
and
it
is
now
i
think
that
we
best
appreciate
the
liberties
taken
with
the
resources
of
the
novelist
by
balzac
his
is
a
case
that
should
be
approached
indirectly
if
one
plunges
straight
into
balzac
at
the
beginning
of
criticism
it
is
hard
to
find
the
right
line
through
the
abundance
of
good
and
bad
in
his
books
there
is
so
much
of
it
and
all
so
strong
and
staring
it
looks
at
first
sight
as
though
his
good
and
his
bad
alike
were
entirely
conspicuous
and
unmistakable
his
devouring
passion
for
life
his
grotesque
romance
his
truth
and
his
falsity
these
cover
the
whole
space
of
the
comédie
between
them
and
nobody
could
fail
to
recognize
the
full
force
of
either
he
is
tremendous
his
taste
is
abominable
what
more
is
there
to
say
of
balzac
and
that
much
has
been
said
so
often
in
varied
words
that
there
can
be
no
need
to
say
it
again
for
the
time
such
is
the
aspect
that
balzac
presents
i
could
feel
when
a
critic
tries
to
face
him
immediately
his
obviousness
seems
to
hide
everything
else
but
if
one
passes
him
by
following
the
track
of
the
novelist
art
elsewhere
and
then
returns
to
him
with
certain
definite
conclusions
his
aspect
is
remarkable
in
quite
a
new
way
his
badness
is
perhaps
as
obvious
as
before
there
is
nothing
fresh
to
discover
about
that
his
greatness
however
wears
a
different
look
it
is
no
longer
the
plain
and
open
surface
that
it
was
it
has
depths
and
recesses
that
did
not
appear
till
now
enticing
to
criticism
promising
plentiful
illustration
of
the
ideas
that
have
been
gathered
by
the
way
one
after
another
the
rarer
obscurer
effects
of
fiction
are
all
found
in
balzac
behind
his
blatant
front
he
illustrates
everything
and
the
only
difficulty
is
to
know
where
to
begin
the
effect
of
the
generalized
picture
for
example
supporting
the
play
of
action
is
one
in
which
balzac
particularly
delights
he
constantly
uses
it
he
makes
it
serve
his
purpose
with
a
very
high
hand
it
becomes
more
than
a
support
it
becomes
a
kind
of
propulsive
force
applied
to
the
action
at
the
start
its
value
is
seen
at
its
greatest
in
such
books
as
le
curé
de
village
père
goriot
la
recherche
de
eugénie
grandet
most
of
all
perhaps
in
this
last
wherever
indeed
his
subject
requires
to
be
lodged
securely
in
its
surroundings
wherever
the
background
is
a
main
condition
of
the
story
balzac
is
in
no
hurry
to
precipitate
the
action
that
can
always
wait
while
he
allows
himself
the
leisure
he
needs
for
massing
the
force
which
is
presently
to
drive
the
drama
on
its
way
nobody
gives
such
attention
as
balzac
does
in
many
of
his
books
and
on
the
whole
in
his
best
to
the
setting
of
the
scene
he
clearly
considers
these
preparatory
pictures
quite
as
important
as
the
events
which
they
are
to
enclose
and
so
in
père
goriot
all
the
potent
life
of
the
maison
vauquer
is
deliberately
collected
and
hoarded
up
to
the
point
where
it
is
enough
when
it
is
let
loose
to
carry
the
story
forward
with
a
strong
sweep
by
the
time
the
story
itself
is
reached
the
maison
vauquer
is
a
fully
created
impression
prepared
to
the
last
stroke
for
the
drama
to
come
anything
that
may
take
place
there
will
have
the
whole
benefit
of
its
setting
without
more
ado
all
the
rank
reality
of
the
house
and
its
inmates
is
immediately
bestowed
on
the
action
when
the
tale
of
goriot
comes
to
the
front
it
is
already
more
than
the
tale
of
a
certain
old
man
and
his
woes
goriot
on
the
spot
is
one
of
maman
boarders
and
the
mere
fact
is
enough
by
now
to
differentiate
him
to
single
him
out
among
miserable
old
men
whatever
he
does
he
carries
with
him
the
daily
experience
of
the
dingy
house
and
the
clattering
meals
and
the
frowzy
company
with
maman
vauquer
hard
and
hungry
and
harassed
todgers
would
have
met
her
sympathetically
they
would
have
understood
each
other
at
the
head
of
it
into
goriot
yearnings
over
his
fashionable
daughters
the
sounds
and
sights
and
smells
of
his
horrible
home
have
all
been
gathered
they
deepen
and
strengthen
his
poor
story
throughout
balzac
care
in
creating
the
scene
therefore
is
truly
economical
it
is
not
merely
a
manner
of
setting
the
stage
for
the
drama
it
is
a
provision
of
character
and
energy
for
the
drama
when
it
begins
his
pictures
of
country
towns
too
saumur
limoges
angoulême
have
the
same
kind
of
part
to
play
in
the
scènes
de
la
vie
de
province
when
balzac
takes
in
hand
the
description
of
a
town
or
a
house
or
a
workshop
he
may
always
be
suspected
at
first
of
abandoning
himself
entirely
to
his
simple
disinterested
craving
for
facts
there
are
times
when
it
seems
that
his
inexhaustible
knowledge
of
facts
is
carrying
him
where
it
will
till
his
only
conscious
purpose
is
to
set
down
on
paper
everything
that
he
knows
he
is
possessed
by
the
lust
of
description
for
its
own
sake
an
insatiable
desire
to
put
every
detail
in
its
place
whether
it
is
needed
or
no
so
it
seems
and
so
it
is
occasionally
no
doubt
there
is
nothing
more
tiresome
in
balzac
than
his
zest
his
delight
his
triumph
when
he
has
apparently
succeeded
in
forgetting
altogether
that
he
is
a
novelist
he
takes
a
proper
pride
in
grandet
or
goriot
or
lucien
of
course
but
his
heart
never
leaps
quite
so
high
it
might
be
thought
as
when
he
sees
a
chance
for
a
discourse
upon
money
or
commerce
or
italian
art
and
yet
the
result
is
always
the
same
in
the
end
when
he
has
finished
his
lengthy
research
among
the
furniture
of
the
lives
that
are
to
be
evoked
he
has
created
a
scene
in
which
action
will
move
as
rapidly
as
he
chooses
without
losing
any
of
its
due
emphasis
he
has
illustrated
in
short
the
way
in
which
a
pictorial
impression
wrought
to
the
right
pitch
will
speed
the
work
of
drama
will
become
an
effective
agent
in
the
book
instead
of
remaining
the
mere
decorative
introduction
that
it
may
seem
to
be
thus
it
is
that
balzac
was
able
to
pack
into
a
short
book
he
never
wrote
a
long
one
such
an
effect
of
crowds
and
events
above
all
such
an
effect
of
time
nobody
knows
how
to
compress
so
much
experience
into
two
or
three
hundred
pages
as
balzac
did
unfailingly
i
can
not
think
that
this
is
due
in
the
least
to
the
laborious
interweaving
of
his
books
into
a
single
scheme
i
could
believe
that
in
general
a
book
of
balzac
suffers
rather
than
gains
by
the
recurrence
of
the
old
names
that
he
has
used
already
elsewhere
it
is
an
amusing
trick
but
exactly
what
is
its
object
i
do
not
speak
of
the
ordinary
sequel
where
the
fortunes
of
somebody
are
followed
for
another
stage
and
where
the
second
part
is
simply
the
continuation
of
the
first
in
a
direct
line
but
what
of
the
famous
idea
of
making
book
after
book
overlap
and
encroach
and
entangle
itself
with
the
rest
by
the
device
of
setting
the
hero
of
one
story
to
figure
more
or
less
obscurely
in
a
dozen
others
the
theory
is
i
suppose
that
the
characters
in
the
background
and
at
the
corners
of
the
action
if
they
are
rastignac
and
camusot
and
nucingen
retain
the
life
they
have
acquired
elsewhere
and
thereby
swell
the
life
of
the
story
in
which
they
reappear
we
are
occupied
for
the
moment
with
some
one
else
and
we
discover
among
his
acquaintances
a
number
of
people
whom
we
already
know
that
fact
it
is
implied
will
add
weight
and
authority
to
the
story
of
the
man
in
the
foreground
who
is
himself
very
likely
a
man
we
have
met
casually
in
another
book
it
ought
to
make
it
must
make
his
situation
peculiarly
real
and
intelligible
that
we
find
him
surrounded
by
familiar
friends
of
our
own
and
that
is
the
artistic
reason
of
the
amazing
ingenuity
with
which
balzac
keeps
them
all
in
play
less
artistic
and
more
mechanical
i
take
it
his
ingenuity
seems
than
it
did
of
old
i
forget
how
few
are
the
mistakes
and
contradictions
of
which
balzac
has
been
convicted
in
the
shuffling
and
of
his
characters
but
when
his
accuracy
has
been
proved
there
still
remains
the
question
of
its
bearing
upon
his
art
i
only
touch
upon
the
question
from
a
single
point
of
view
when
i
consider
whether
the
density
of
life
in
so
many
of
his
short
pieces
can
really
owe
anything
to
the
perpetual
flitting
of
the
men
and
women
from
book
to
book
suppose
that
for
the
moment
balzac
is
evoking
the
figure
and
fortunes
of
lucien
de
rubempré
and
that
a
woman
who
appears
incidentally
in
his
story
turns
out
to
be
our
delphine
goriot
daughter
we
know
a
great
deal
about
the
past
of
delphine
as
it
happens
but
at
this
present
juncture
in
story
her
past
is
entirely
irrelevant
it
belongs
to
another
adventure
where
it
mattered
exceedingly
an
adventure
that
took
place
before
lucien
was
heard
of
at
all
as
for
his
story
and
for
the
reality
with
which
it
may
be
endowed
this
depends
solely
upon
our
understanding
of
world
experience
and
if
delphine
old
affairs
are
no
part
of
it
our
previous
knowledge
of
her
can
not
help
us
with
lucien
it
detracts
rather
from
the
force
of
his
effect
it
sets
up
a
relation
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
a
relation
between
delphine
and
the
reader
which
only
obstructs
our
view
of
the
world
as
lucien
sees
it
of
the
characters
in
the
remoter
planes
of
the
action
and
that
is
delphine
position
in
his
story
no
more
is
expected
than
their
value
for
the
purpose
of
the
action
in
the
foreground
that
is
all
that
can
be
in
the
book
whatever
more
they
may
bring
will
lie
idle
will
contribute
nothing
and
may
even
become
an
embarrassment
the
numberless
people
in
the
comédie
who
carry
their
lengthening
train
of
old
associations
from
book
to
book
may
give
the
comédie
as
a
whole
the
look
of
unity
that
balzac
desired
that
is
another
point
but
in
any
single
story
such
of
these
people
as
appear
by
the
way
incidentally
must
for
the
time
being
shed
their
irrelevant
life
if
they
fail
to
do
so
they
disturb
the
unity
of
the
story
and
confuse
its
truth
balzac
unrivalled
power
of
placing
a
figure
in
its
surroundings
is
not
to
be
explained
then
by
his
skill
in
working
his
separate
pieces
together
into
one
great
web
the
design
of
the
human
comedy
so
largely
artificial
forced
upon
it
as
his
purpose
widened
is
no
enhancement
of
the
best
of
his
books
the
fullness
of
experience
which
is
rendered
in
these
is
exactly
the
same
is
more
expressive
if
anything
when
they
are
taken
out
of
their
context
it
is
all
to
be
attributed
to
their
own
art
i
come
back
therefore
to
the
way
in
which
balzac
handled
his
vast
store
of
facts
when
he
set
out
to
tell
a
story
and
made
them
count
in
the
action
which
he
brought
to
the
fore
he
seldom
i
think
regards
them
as
material
to
be
disguised
to
be
given
by
implication
in
the
drama
itself
he
is
quite
content
to
offer
his
own
impression
of
the
general
landscape
of
the
story
a
leisurely
display
which
brings
us
finally
to
the
point
of
action
then
the
action
starts
forward
with
a
reserve
of
vigour
that
helps
it
in
various
ways
the
more
important
of
these
as
i
see
them
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
next
chapter
but
meanwhile
i
may
pick
out
another
one
that
is
often
to
be
seen
in
balzac
work
and
that
he
needed
only
too
often
it
was
not
the
best
of
his
work
that
needed
it
but
the
effect
i
mean
is
an
interesting
one
in
itself
and
it
appeals
to
a
critic
where
it
occurs
it
shows
how
a
novelist
while
in
general
seeking
to
raise
the
power
of
his
picture
by
means
of
drama
will
sometimes
reverse
the
process
deliberately
in
order
to
rescue
the
power
of
his
drama
from
becoming
violence
if
fiction
always
aims
at
the
appearance
of
truth
there
are
times
when
the
dramatic
method
is
too
much
for
it
too
searching
and
too
betraying
it
leaves
the
story
to
speak
for
itself
but
perhaps
the
story
may
then
say
too
much
to
be
reasonably
credible
it
must
be
restrained
qualified
toned
down
in
order
to
make
its
best
effect
where
the
action
in
short
is
likely
to
seem
harsh
overcharged
romantic
it
is
made
to
look
less
so
less
hazardous
and
more
real
by
recourse
to
the
art
of
the
balzac
it
can
not
be
denied
had
frequent
cause
to
look
about
him
for
whatever
means
there
might
be
of
extenuating
and
so
of
confirming
an
incredible
story
his
passion
for
truth
was
often
in
conflict
with
his
lust
for
marvels
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
mixed
is
the
chief
interest
i
dare
say
of
some
of
his
books
see
him
for
example
in
the
splendeurs
et
misères
des
courtisanes
trying
with
one
hand
to
write
a
novel
of
parisian
manners
with
the
other
a
romance
of
mystery
and
to
do
full
justice
to
both
the
napoleon
of
crime
and
esther
the
inspired
courtesan
represent
the
romance
and
balzac
sets
himself
to
absorb
the
extravagant
tale
into
a
study
of
actual
life
if
he
can
get
the
tale
firmly
embedded
in
a
background
of
truth
its
falsity
may
be
disguised
the
whole
book
may
even
pass
for
a
scene
of
the
human
comedy
it
may
be
accepted
as
a
piece
of
reality
on
the
same
level
say
as
eugénie
grandet
or
les
parents
pauvres
that
is
evidently
his
aim
and
if
only
his
romance
were
a
little
less
gaudy
or
his
truth
not
quite
so
true
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
attaining
it
the
action
would
be
subdued
and
kept
in
its
place
by
the
pictorial
setting
the
trouble
is
that
balzac
idea
of
a
satisfying
crime
is
as
wild
as
his
hold
upon
facts
is
sober
so
that
an
impossible
strain
is
thrown
upon
his
method
of
reconciling
the
two
do
what
he
will
his
romance
remains
staringly
false
in
its
contrast
with
his
reality
there
is
an
open
gap
between
the
wonderful
pictures
of
the
town
in
illusions
perdues
and
the
theatrical
drama
of
the
old
convict
which
they
introduce
yet
his
method
was
a
right
one
though
it
was
perverse
of
balzac
to
be
occupied
at
all
with
such
devices
when
he
might
have
rejected
his
falsity
altogether
in
another
man
work
where
there
is
never
this
sharp
distinction
between
true
and
false
where
both
are
merged
into
something
different
from
either
in
dickens
work
the
method
i
refer
to
is
much
more
successfully
followed
and
there
in
any
of
dickens
later
books
we
find
the
clearest
example
of
it
i
have
already
been
reminded
of
stevenson
word
upon
this
matter
stevenson
noted
how
dickens
way
of
dealing
with
his
romantic
intrigues
was
to
lead
gradually
into
them
through
scenes
of
character
and
humour
so
that
his
world
is
actual
its
air
familiar
by
the
time
that
his
plot
begins
to
thicken
he
gives
himself
an
ample
margin
in
which
to
make
the
impression
of
the
kind
of
truth
he
needs
before
beginning
to
concentrate
upon
the
fabulous
action
of
the
climax
bleak
house
is
a
very
good
case
the
highly
coloured
climax
in
that
book
is
approached
with
great
skill
and
caution
all
in
his
most
masterly
style
a
broad
stream
of
diversified
life
moves
slowly
in
a
certain
direction
so
deliberately
at
first
that
its
scope
its
spread
is
much
more
evident
than
its
movement
the
book
is
a
big
survey
of
a
quantity
of
odd
and
amusing
people
and
it
is
only
by
degrees
that
the
discursive
method
is
abandoned
and
the
narrative
brought
to
a
point
presently
we
are
in
the
thick
of
the
story
hurrying
to
the
catastrophe
without
having
noticed
at
all
it
may
be
that
our
novel
of
manners
has
turned
into
a
romantic
drama
with
a
mysterious
crime
to
crown
it
dickens
manages
it
far
more
artfully
than
balzac
because
his
imagination
is
not
like
balzac
divided
against
itself
the
world
which
he
peopled
with
skimpole
and
guppy
and
the
bayham
badgers
was
a
world
that
could
easily
include
lady
dedlock
for
though
she
is
perhaps
of
the
theatre
they
are
certainly
not
of
the
common
earth
they
and
she
alike
are
at
the
same
angle
to
literal
fact
they
diverging
one
way
she
another
they
accordingly
make
a
kind
of
reality
which
can
assimilate
her
romance
dickens
was
saved
from
trying
to
write
two
books
at
once
by
the
fact
that
one
completely
satisfied
him
it
expressed
the
exciting
amazing
exhilarating
world
he
lived
in
himself
with
its
consistent
transmutation
of
all
values
and
he
knew
no
other
the
method
which
he
finally
worked
out
for
himself
was
exactly
what
he
required
there
might
be
much
to
say
of
it
for
it
is
by
no
means
simple
but
i
am
only
concerned
with
one
or
two
points
in
it
the
chief
characteristic
i
take
to
be
this
careful
introduction
of
violent
drama
into
a
scene
already
prepared
to
vouch
for
it
a
scene
so
alive
that
it
compels
belief
so
queer
that
almost
anything
might
happen
there
naturally
the
effect
which
dickens
gets
from
the
picture
in
his
novels
as
opposed
to
the
action
is
used
as
a
sort
of
attestation
of
the
action
and
it
surely
fulfils
its
mission
very
strikingly
in
the
best
of
his
work
the
best
from
this
point
of
view
bleak
house
dombey
and
son
our
mutual
friend
his
incurable
love
of
labyrinthine
mystification
when
it
really
ran
away
with
him
certainly
defeated
all
precautions
not
even
old
dorrit
marshalsea
not
even
flora
and
aunt
can
do
anything
to
carry
off
the
story
of
the
clennams
but
so
long
as
he
was
content
with
a
fairly
straightforward
romance
all
went
well
the
magnificent
life
that
he
projected
was
prepared
to
receive
and
to
speed
it
blimber
and
pipchin
and
miss
tox
the
podsnaps
and
twemlow
and
the
veneerings
all
contribute
out
of
their
overflow
of
energy
to
the
force
of
a
drama
a
drama
in
which
they
may
take
no
specific
part
but
which
depends
on
them
for
the
furnishing
of
an
appropriate
scene
a
favouring
background
a
world
attuned
this
and
so
much
more
they
do
that
it
may
seem
like
insulting
them
even
to
think
for
a
moment
of
their
subordination
to
the
general
design
which
is
indeed
a
great
deal
less
interesting
than
they
but
method
is
sound
and
good
and
not
the
less
so
because
he
used
it
for
comparatively
trivial
purposes
it
is
strange
that
he
should
have
known
how
to
invent
such
a
scene
and
then
have
found
no
better
drama
to
enact
on
it
strange
and
always
stranger
with
every
that
does
not
affect
his
handling
of
a
subject
which
is
all
that
i
deal
with
here
the
life
which
he
creates
and
distributes
right
and
left
in
such
a
book
as
bleak
house
before
bending
to
his
story
this
i
call
his
picture
for
picture
it
is
in
effect
not
dramatic
action
it
exhibits
the
world
in
which
lady
dedlock
is
to
meditate
murder
the
fog
of
the
suit
in
chancery
out
of
which
the
intrigue
of
the
book
is
to
emerge
it
is
the
summary
of
a
situation
with
its
elements
spreading
widely
and
touching
many
lives
it
gathers
them
in
and
gives
an
impression
of
them
all
it
is
pictorial
as
a
whole
and
quite
as
much
so
as
any
of
broad
visions
but
i
have
noted
before
how
inevitably
picture
unlike
thackeray
is
presented
in
the
of
scenic
action
and
here
is
a
case
in
point
all
this
impression
of
life
stretching
from
the
law
courts
to
the
marshes
of
chesney
wold
from
krook
and
miss
flite
to
sir
leicester
and
volumnia
is
rendered
as
incident
as
a
succession
of
particular
occasions
never
or
very
seldom
as
general
and
narrative
after
thackeray
manner
dickens
continually
holds
to
the
immediate
scene
even
when
his
object
is
undramatic
he
is
always
readier
to
work
in
action
and
dialogue
than
to
describe
at
large
he
is
happier
in
placing
a
character
there
before
us
as
the
man
or
woman
talked
and
behaved
in
a
certain
hour
on
a
certain
spot
than
in
reflecting
a
long
impression
of
their
manner
of
living
in
thackeray
hands
the
life
of
miss
flite
for
instance
would
have
become
a
legend
recalled
and
lingered
over
illustrated
by
passing
glimpses
of
her
ways
and
oddities
with
dickens
she
is
always
a
little
human
being
who
figures
upon
a
scene
in
a
group
a
visible
creature
acting
her
small
part
she
is
always
dramatic
and
dickens
using
this
method
everywhere
even
in
such
a
case
as
hers
even
where
his
purpose
that
is
to
say
is
pictorial
to
give
the
sense
of
a
various
and
vivacious
background
is
forced
to
crystallize
and
formulate
his
characters
very
sharply
if
they
are
to
make
their
effect
it
is
why
he
is
so
often
reduced
to
the
expedient
of
labelling
his
people
with
a
trick
or
a
phrase
which
they
have
to
bring
with
them
every
time
they
appear
their
opportunities
are
strictly
limited
the
author
does
not
help
them
out
by
glancing
freely
into
their
lives
and
sketching
them
broadly
flite
snagsby
chadband
and
the
rest
of
them
whatever
they
are
they
must
be
all
of
it
within
narrow
bounds
within
the
few
scenes
that
can
be
allotted
to
them
and
if
one
of
them
fails
now
and
then
it
is
not
surprising
the
wonder
is
that
most
of
them
succeed
so
brilliantly
in
thus
translating
his
picture
into
action
dickens
chose
the
most
exigent
way
but
it
was
always
the
right
way
for
him
he
was
curiously
incapable
in
the
other
when
occasionally
he
tries
his
hand
at
in
manner
attempting
to
summarize
an
impression
of
social
life
among
the
veneerings
of
official
life
among
the
barnacles
his
touch
is
wild
indeed
away
from
a
definite
episode
in
an
hour
prescribed
he
is
seldom
at
ease
but
though
the
actual
presentation
is
thus
dramatic
his
books
are
in
fact
examples
of
the
pictured
scene
that
opens
and
spreads
very
gradually
in
order
to
make
a
valid
world
for
a
drama
that
could
not
be
precipitated
forthwith
a
drama
that
would
be
naked
romance
if
it
stood
by
itself
stevenson
happened
upon
this
point
with
regard
to
dickens
in
devising
the
same
method
for
a
story
of
his
own
the
wrecker
a
book
in
which
he
too
proposed
to
insinuate
an
abrupt
and
violent
intrigue
into
credible
continuous
life
he
of
course
knew
precisely
what
he
was
doing
where
dickens
followed
as
i
suppose
an
uncritical
instinct
the
purpose
of
the
wrecker
is
clearly
written
upon
it
and
very
ingeniously
carried
out
but
i
doubt
whether
stevenson
himself
noticed
that
in
all
his
work
or
nearly
he
was
using
an
artifice
of
the
same
kind
he
spoke
of
his
habitual
inclination
towards
the
story
told
in
the
first
person
as
though
it
were
a
chance
preference
and
he
may
not
have
perceived
how
logically
it
followed
from
the
subjects
that
mostly
attracted
him
they
were
strongly
romantic
vividly
dramatic
he
never
had
occasion
to
use
the
first
person
for
the
effect
i
considered
a
while
ago
its
enhancement
of
a
plain
narrative
i
called
it
the
first
step
towards
the
dramatization
of
a
story
and
so
it
is
in
a
book
like
esmond
a
broadly
pictured
novel
of
manners
but
it
is
more
than
this
in
a
book
like
the
master
of
ballantrae
where
the
subject
is
a
piece
of
forcible
closely
knit
action
the
value
of
rendering
it
as
narrative
of
placing
it
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
who
was
there
on
the
spot
is
in
this
book
the
value
of
working
the
drama
into
a
picture
of
passing
it
through
a
man
thought
and
catching
his
reflection
of
it
as
the
picture
in
esmond
is
enhanced
so
the
drama
in
ballantrae
is
toned
and
qualified
by
the
method
of
presentation
the
same
method
has
a
different
effect
according
to
the
subject
upon
which
it
is
used
as
a
splash
of
the
same
grey
might
darken
white
surface
and
lighten
a
black
in
esmond
the
use
of
the
first
person
raises
the
book
in
the
direction
of
drama
in
ballantrae
it
thrusts
the
book
in
the
other
direction
towards
the
pictured
impression
so
it
would
seem
but
perhaps
it
is
a
fine
distinction
that
criticism
can
afford
to
pass
by
xv
as
for
the
peculiar
accent
and
stir
of
life
the
life
behind
the
story
balzac
manner
of
finding
and
expressing
it
is
always
interesting
he
seems
to
look
for
it
most
readily
not
in
the
nature
of
the
men
and
women
whose
action
makes
the
story
or
not
there
to
begin
with
but
in
their
streets
and
houses
and
rooms
he
can
not
think
of
his
people
without
the
homes
they
inhabit
with
balzac
to
imagine
a
human
being
is
to
imagine
a
province
a
city
a
corner
of
the
city
a
building
at
a
turn
of
the
street
certain
furnished
rooms
and
finally
the
man
or
woman
who
lives
in
them
he
can
not
be
satisfied
that
the
tenor
of
this
creature
existence
is
at
all
understood
without
a
minute
knowledge
of
the
things
and
objects
that
surround
it
so
strong
is
his
conviction
upon
this
point
that
it
gives
a
special
savour
to
the
many
pages
in
which
he
describes
how
the
doorway
is
approached
how
the
passage
leads
to
the
staircase
how
the
are
placed
in
the
house
which
is
to
be
the
scene
of
his
drama
these
descriptions
are
clear
and
they
are
offered
as
an
essential
preliminary
to
the
story
a
matter
that
must
obviously
be
dealt
with
once
for
all
before
the
story
can
proceed
and
he
communicates
his
certainty
to
the
reader
he
imposes
his
belief
in
the
need
for
precision
and
fullness
balzac
is
so
sure
that
every
detail
be
known
down
to
the
vases
on
the
mantelpiece
or
the
pots
and
pans
in
the
cupboard
that
his
reader
can
not
begin
to
question
it
everything
is
made
to
appear
as
important
as
the
author
feels
it
to
be
his
manner
is
well
to
be
watched
in
eugénie
grandet
that
account
of
the
great
bare
old
house
of
the
miser
at
saumur
is
as
plain
and
straightforward
as
an
inventory
no
attempt
is
made
to
insinuate
the
impression
of
the
place
by
hints
and
balzac
marches
up
to
it
and
goes
steadily
through
it
until
our
necessary
information
is
complete
and
there
he
leaves
it
there
is
no
subtlety
in
such
a
method
it
seems
a
lighter
shyer
handling
of
the
facts
more
suggestion
and
less
statement
might
be
expected
to
make
a
deeper
effect
and
indeed
balzac
confident
way
is
not
one
that
would
give
a
good
result
in
most
hands
it
would
produce
the
kind
of
description
that
the
eye
travels
over
unperceivingly
the
conscientious
introduction
that
tells
us
nothing
yet
balzac
contrives
to
make
it
tell
everything
and
the
simple
explanation
is
that
he
more
than
anyone
else
everything
the
place
exists
in
his
thought
it
is
not
to
him
the
mere
sensation
of
a
place
with
cloudy
corners
uncertain
recesses
which
only
grow
definite
as
he
touches
and
probes
them
with
his
phrases
a
writer
of
a
different
sort
an
impressionist
who
is
aware
of
the
effect
of
a
scene
rather
than
of
the
scene
itself
proceeds
inevitably
after
another
fashion
if
he
attempted
balzac
method
he
would
have
to
feel
his
way
tentatively
adding
fact
to
fact
and
his
account
would
consist
of
that
mechanical
sum
of
details
which
makes
no
image
balzac
is
so
thoroughly
possessed
of
his
image
that
he
can
reproduce
it
inch
by
inch
fact
by
fact
without
losing
the
effect
of
it
as
a
whole
he
can
start
from
the
edge
of
his
scene
from
a
street
of
old
houses
from
the
doorstep
of
one
old
house
and
leave
a
perfectly
firm
and
telling
impression
behind
him
as
he
proceeds
when
his
description
is
finished
and
the
last
detail
in
its
place
the
home
of
the
grandets
is
securely
built
for
the
needs
of
the
story
possessing
all
the
significance
that
balzac
demands
of
it
it
will
presently
be
seen
that
he
demands
a
great
deal
i
said
that
his
drama
has
always
the
benefit
of
a
reserve
of
force
stored
up
for
it
beforehand
in
the
general
picture
and
though
in
this
picture
is
included
the
fortunes
and
characters
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
grandets
and
their
neighbours
a
large
part
of
it
is
the
material
scene
the
very
walls
that
are
to
witness
the
coming
events
the
figure
of
grandet
the
old
miser
is
indeed
called
up
and
accounted
for
abundantly
in
all
the
conditions
of
his
past
but
the
house
too
within
and
without
is
laid
under
strict
contribution
is
used
to
the
full
in
the
story
it
is
a
presence
and
an
influence
that
counts
throughout
and
counts
particularly
in
a
matter
that
is
essential
to
the
book
effect
a
matter
that
could
scarcely
be
provided
for
in
any
other
way
as
it
happens
of
this
i
shall
speak
in
a
moment
but
at
once
it
is
noticeable
how
the
maison
grandet
like
the
maison
vauquer
helps
the
book
on
its
way
it
incarnates
all
the
past
of
its
old
owner
and
visibly
links
it
to
the
action
when
the
story
opens
the
elaborate
summary
of
grandet
early
life
the
scrupulously
exact
account
of
the
building
of
his
prosperity
is
brought
to
an
issue
in
the
image
of
the
cold
dreary
and
silent
house
at
the
upper
end
of
the
town
from
whence
the
drama
widens
again
in
its
turn
how
it
is
that
balzac
has
precisely
the
right
scene
in
his
mind
a
house
that
perfectly
expresses
his
and
all
its
associations
that
of
course
is
balzac
secret
his
method
would
be
nothing
without
the
quality
of
his
imagination
his
use
of
the
scene
is
another
matter
and
there
it
is
possible
to
reckon
how
much
of
his
general
effect
the
sense
of
the
moral
and
social
foundation
of
his
story
is
given
by
its
inanimate
setting
he
has
to
picture
a
character
and
a
train
of
life
and
to
a
great
extent
he
does
so
by
describing
a
house
beyond
old
grandet
and
the
kind
of
existence
imposed
upon
his
household
the
drama
needs
little
by
way
of
preparation
the
daughter
eugénie
with
her
mother
must
stand
out
clearly
to
the
fore
but
a
very
few
touches
bring
these
two
women
to
life
in
their
shadowy
abode
they
are
simple
and
patient
and
devoted
between
the
dominance
of
the
old
man
and
the
monotony
of
the
provincial
routine
eugénie
and
her
mother
are
easily
intelligible
the
two
local
aspirants
to
the
girl
fortune
and
their
supporters
on
either
side
the
cruchotins
and
the
grassinistes
are
subsidiary
figures
they
are
sufficiently
rendered
by
their
appearance
in
a
flock
for
a
sociable
evening
with
the
grandets
the
faithful
the
shrewd
and
valiant
nanon
is
quickly
sketched
and
there
then
is
the
picture
that
balzac
prepares
for
the
action
which
opens
with
the
arrival
of
charles
eugénie
young
and
unknown
cousin
except
for
charles
all
the
material
of
the
drama
is
contained
in
the
first
impression
of
the
household
and
the
small
eugénie
story
is
implied
in
it
and
her
romance
from
the
moment
it
begins
inherits
the
reality
and
the
continuity
of
the
experience
charles
himself
is
so
light
a
weight
that
in
his
case
no
introduction
is
needed
at
all
a
single
glance
at
him
is
enough
to
show
the
charm
of
his
airy
elegance
his
only
function
in
the
story
is
to
create
the
long
dream
of
life
and
for
that
he
needs
nothing
but
his
unlikeness
to
the
cruchotins
and
the
grassinistes
they
and
eugénie
therefore
between
them
provide
for
his
effect
before
he
appears
they
by
their
dull
provinciality
she
by
her
sensitive
ignorance
the
whole
scene
on
the
verge
of
the
action
is
full
of
dormant
echoes
and
the
first
movement
wakes
them
the
girl
placed
as
she
is
her
circumstances
known
as
they
are
all
but
make
the
tale
of
their
own
accord
only
the
simple
facts
are
wanting
their
effect
is
already
in
the
air
and
accordingly
the
story
slips
away
from
its
beginning
without
hesitation
in
a
sense
it
is
a
very
slight
story
there
is
scarcely
anything
in
it
but
eugénie
quick
flush
of
emotion
and
then
her
patient
cherishing
of
its
memory
and
this
simplicity
may
seem
to
detract
perhaps
from
the
skilfulness
of
balzac
preparation
where
there
is
so
little
in
the
way
of
incident
or
clash
of
character
to
provide
for
where
the
people
are
so
plain
and
perspicuous
and
next
to
nothing
happens
to
them
it
should
not
be
difficult
to
make
an
expressive
scene
for
the
drama
and
its
few
facts
all
that
occurs
in
the
main
line
of
the
story
is
that
eugénie
falls
in
love
with
her
cousin
bids
him
when
he
goes
to
make
his
fortune
in
the
indies
trustfully
awaits
him
for
a
number
of
years
and
discovers
his
faithlessness
when
he
returns
her
mother
death
and
then
her
father
are
almost
the
only
events
in
the
long
interval
of
absence
simple
indeed
but
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
story
which
it
is
most
puzzling
to
handle
the
material
is
scanty
and
yet
it
covers
a
good
many
years
and
somehow
the
narrative
must
render
the
length
of
the
years
without
the
help
of
positive
and
concrete
stuff
to
fill
them
the
whole
point
of
the
story
is
lost
unless
we
are
made
to
feel
the
slow
crawling
of
time
while
eugénie
waited
but
what
is
there
in
her
life
to
account
for
the
time
to
bridge
the
interval
to
illustrate
its
extent
balzac
has
to
make
a
long
impression
of
vacuity
eugénie
grandet
contains
a
decidedly
tough
subject
in
such
a
case
i
suppose
the
first
instinct
of
almost
any
would
be
to
lengthen
the
narrative
of
her
loneliness
by
elaborating
the
picture
of
her
state
of
mind
drawing
out
the
record
of
expectancy
and
patience
and
failing
hope
if
nothing
befalls
her
from
without
or
so
little
the
time
must
be
filled
with
the
long
drama
of
her
experience
within
the
centre
of
the
story
would
then
be
cast
in
her
consciousness
in
which
there
would
be
reflected
the
gradual
drop
of
her
emotion
from
glowing
newness
to
the
level
of
daily
custom
and
thence
again
to
the
chill
of
disillusion
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
kind
of
form
which
the
book
would
take
in
order
to
assure
its
full
value
to
eugénie
monotonous
suffering
the
story
would
be
given
from
her
point
of
view
entirely
from
hers
the
external
facts
of
her
existence
would
all
be
seen
through
her
eyes
making
substance
for
her
thought
we
should
live
eugénie
throughout
we
should
share
her
vigil
morning
and
evening
summer
and
winter
while
she
sat
in
the
silent
house
and
listened
to
the
noises
of
life
in
the
street
while
the
sun
shone
for
others
and
not
for
her
while
the
light
waned
the
wind
howled
the
snow
fell
and
hushed
the
busy
town
still
eugénie
would
sit
at
her
window
still
we
should
follow
the
flow
of
her
resigned
and
uncomplaining
meditations
until
at
last
the
author
could
judge
that
five
years
ten
years
whatever
it
may
be
had
been
sufficiently
shown
in
their
dreary
lapse
and
that
charles
might
now
come
back
from
the
indies
so
it
would
be
and
so
it
would
have
to
be
a
novelist
might
easily
feel
how
else
could
the
due
suggestion
of
time
be
given
where
there
is
so
little
to
show
for
it
in
dramatic
facts
but
balzac
treatment
of
the
story
is
quite
unexpected
he
lays
it
out
in
a
fashion
that
is
worth
noting
as
a
good
example
of
the
freedom
of
movement
that
his
great
pictorial
genius
allowed
him
with
his
scene
and
its
general
setting
so
perfectly
rendered
the
story
takes
care
of
itself
on
every
side
with
the
minimum
of
trouble
on
his
part
his
real
trouble
is
over
when
the
action
begins
he
is
not
even
disturbed
by
this
difficulty
of
presenting
the
sense
of
time
the
plan
of
eugénie
grandet
as
the
book
stands
seems
to
have
been
made
without
any
regard
to
the
chief
and
most
exacting
demand
of
the
story
where
another
writer
would
be
using
every
device
he
could
think
of
to
mark
the
effect
of
the
succeeding
years
balzac
is
free
to
tell
the
story
as
straightforwardly
as
he
chooses
to
eugénie
the
great
and
only
adventure
of
her
life
was
contained
in
the
few
days
or
weeks
of
charles
first
visit
nothing
to
compare
with
that
excitement
ever
happened
to
her
again
and
balzac
makes
this
episode
bulk
as
largely
in
the
book
as
it
did
in
her
life
he
pauses
over
it
and
elaborates
it
unconcerned
by
the
fact
that
in
the
book
in
the
whole
effect
it
is
to
produce
the
episode
is
only
the
beginning
of
eugénie
story
only
the
prelude
to
her
years
of
waiting
and
watching
he
extends
his
account
of
it
so
far
nevertheless
that
he
has
written
two
thirds
of
the
book
by
the
time
the
young
man
is
finally
despatched
to
the
indies
it
means
that
the
duration
of
the
story
and
the
duration
is
the
principal
fact
in
it
is
hardly
considered
at
all
after
the
opening
of
the
action
there
is
almost
no
picture
of
the
slowly
moving
years
there
is
little
but
a
concise
chronicle
of
the
few
widely
spaced
events
balzac
is
at
no
pains
to
sit
with
eugénie
in
the
twilight
while
the
seasons
revolve
not
for
him
to
linger
gazing
sympathetically
over
her
shoulder
tenderly
exploring
her
sentiments
he
is
actually
capable
of
beginning
a
paragraph
with
the
casual
announcement
five
years
went
by
in
this
way
as
though
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
who
imagine
that
time
may
be
expressed
by
the
mere
statement
of
its
length
yet
there
is
time
in
his
book
it
is
very
certain
time
that
lags
and
loiters
till
the
girl
has
lost
her
youth
and
has
dropped
into
the
dull
groove
from
which
she
will
evidently
never
again
be
dislodged
balzac
can
treat
the
story
as
concisely
as
he
will
he
can
record
eugénie
simple
experience
from
without
and
yet
make
the
fading
of
her
young
hope
appear
as
gradual
and
protracted
as
need
be
and
all
because
he
has
prepared
in
advance
with
his
picture
of
the
life
of
the
grandets
a
complete
and
enduring
impression
his
preliminary
picture
included
the
representation
of
time
secured
the
sense
of
it
so
thoroughly
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
recurring
to
it
again
the
routine
of
the
maison
grandet
is
too
clearly
known
to
be
forgotten
the
sight
of
the
girl
and
her
mother
leading
their
sequestered
lives
in
the
shadow
of
their
old
tyrant
obsession
is
a
sensation
that
persists
to
the
end
of
their
story
their
dreary
days
accumulate
and
fill
the
year
with
hardly
a
break
in
its
monotony
the
next
year
and
the
next
are
the
same
except
that
old
meanness
is
accentuated
as
his
wealth
increases
the
present
is
like
the
past
the
future
will
prolong
the
present
in
such
a
scene
eugénie
patient
acquiescence
in
middle
age
becomes
a
visible
fact
is
divined
and
accepted
at
once
without
further
insistence
it
is
latent
in
the
scene
from
the
beginning
even
at
the
time
of
the
small
romance
of
her
youth
to
dwell
upon
the
shades
of
her
long
disappointment
is
needless
for
her
power
of
endurance
and
her
fidelity
are
fully
created
in
the
book
before
they
are
put
to
the
test
five
years
went
by
says
balzac
but
before
he
says
it
we
already
see
them
opening
and
closing
upon
the
girl
bearing
down
upon
her
solitude
exhausting
her
freshness
but
not
the
dumb
resignation
in
which
she
sits
and
waits
the
endlessness
the
sameness
the
silence
which
another
writer
would
have
to
tackle
somehow
after
disposing
of
the
brief
episode
of
charles
visit
balzac
has
it
all
in
hand
he
can
finish
off
his
book
without
long
delay
his
deliberate
approach
to
the
action
through
the
picture
of
the
house
and
its
inmates
has
achieved
its
purpose
it
has
given
him
the
effect
which
the
action
most
demands
and
could
least
acquire
by
itself
the
effect
of
time
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
story
immensely
gains
by
being
treated
in
balzac
way
rather
than
as
the
life
of
a
disappointed
girl
studied
from
within
in
that
case
the
subject
of
the
book
might
easily
seem
to
be
wearing
thin
for
the
fact
is
that
eugénie
has
not
the
stuff
of
character
to
give
much
interest
to
her
story
supposing
it
were
seen
through
her
eyes
she
is
good
and
true
and
devoted
but
she
lacks
the
poetry
the
inner
resonance
that
might
make
a
living
drama
of
her
simple
emotions
balzac
was
always
too
prosaic
for
the
creation
of
virtue
his
innocent
people
unless
they
may
be
grotesque
as
well
as
innocent
like
pons
or
goriot
live
in
a
world
that
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
investigation
the
interest
of
eugénie
would
infallibly
be
lowered
not
heightened
by
closer
participation
in
her
romance
it
is
much
better
to
look
at
it
from
outside
as
balzac
does
for
the
most
part
and
to
note
the
incidents
that
befell
her
always
provided
that
the
image
of
lagging
time
can
be
fashioned
and
preserved
as
for
that
balzac
has
no
cause
to
be
anxious
it
is
as
certain
that
he
can
do
what
he
will
with
the
subject
of
a
story
handle
it
aright
and
compel
it
to
make
its
impression
as
that
he
will
fail
to
understand
the
sensibility
of
a
girl
i
can
not
imagine
that
the
value
of
the
novelist
picture
as
preparation
for
his
drama
could
be
proved
more
strikingly
than
it
is
proved
in
this
book
where
so
much
is
expected
of
it
eugénie
grandet
is
typical
of
a
natural
bent
on
the
part
of
any
prudent
writer
of
fiction
the
instinct
to
relieve
the
climax
of
the
story
by
taxing
it
as
little
as
possible
when
it
is
reached
the
climax
ought
to
complete
to
add
the
touch
that
makes
the
book
whole
and
organic
that
is
its
task
and
that
only
it
should
be
free
to
do
what
it
must
without
any
unnecessary
distraction
and
nothing
need
distract
it
that
can
be
dealt
with
and
despatched
at
an
earlier
stage
the
climax
in
grandet
is
not
a
dramatic
point
not
a
single
incident
it
lies
in
the
slow
chill
that
very
gradually
descends
upon
eugénie
hope
balzac
carefully
refrains
from
making
the
book
hinge
on
anything
so
commonplace
as
a
sudden
discovery
of
the
young
man
want
of
faith
the
worst
kind
of
disappointment
does
not
happen
like
that
falling
as
a
stroke
it
steals
into
a
life
and
spreads
imperceptibly
final
act
of
disloyalty
is
only
a
kind
of
coda
to
a
drama
that
is
practically
complete
without
it
here
then
is
a
climax
that
is
essentially
pictorial
an
impression
of
change
and
decay
needing
time
in
plenty
above
all
and
balzac
leads
into
it
so
cunningly
that
a
short
summary
of
a
few
plain
facts
is
all
that
is
required
when
it
comes
to
the
point
he
saves
his
climax
in
other
words
from
the
burden
of
deliberate
expatiation
which
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
bound
to
incur
he
leaves
nothing
for
it
to
accomplish
but
just
the
necessary
touch
the
movement
that
declares
and
fulfils
the
intention
of
the
book
there
is
the
same
power
at
work
upon
material
even
more
baffling
apparently
in
la
recherche
de
the
subject
of
that
perfect
tale
is
of
course
the
growth
of
a
fixed
idea
and
balzac
was
faced
with
the
task
of
showing
the
slow
aggravation
of
a
man
ruin
through
a
series
of
outbreaks
differing
in
no
way
one
from
another
save
in
their
increasing
violence
claes
the
excellent
and
prosperous
young
burgher
of
douai
pillar
of
the
old
civic
stateliness
of
flanders
is
dragged
and
dragged
into
his
calamitous
experiments
by
the
bare
failure
as
he
is
persuaded
of
each
one
in
turn
each
time
his
researches
are
on
the
verge
of
yielding
him
the
absolute
the
philosopher
stone
and
each
time
the
prospect
is
more
shining
than
before
success
wealth
enough
to
restore
his
deepening
losses
a
thousand
times
over
is
assured
by
one
more
attempt
the
money
to
make
it
must
be
found
and
so
all
other
interest
in
life
is
forgotten
his
pride
and
repute
are
sacrificed
the
splendid
house
is
gradually
stripped
of
its
treasures
his
family
are
thrust
into
poverty
and
he
himself
dies
degraded
insane
with
success
surely
surely
success
this
time
actually
in
his
grasp
that
is
all
and
on
that
straight
sustained
movement
the
book
must
remain
throughout
reiterating
one
effect
with
growing
intensity
always
at
the
pitch
of
high
hope
and
sharp
disappointment
always
prepared
to
heighten
and
sharpen
it
a
little
further
there
can
be
no
development
through
any
variety
of
incident
it
is
the
same
suspense
and
the
same
shock
again
and
again
constantly
more
disastrous
than
before
here
too
balzac
amasses
in
his
opening
picture
the
reserve
of
effect
that
he
needs
he
recognizes
the
ample
resource
of
the
dignity
the
opulence
the
worth
the
tradition
inherited
by
families
like
that
of
claes
of
honourable
line
rulers
of
rich
cities
patrons
of
great
art
the
house
of
claes
with
its
fine
architecture
its
portraits
its
dark
furniture
and
gleaming
silver
its
garden
of
rare
tulips
balzac
imagination
is
poured
into
the
scene
it
is
exactly
the
kind
of
opportunity
that
he
welcomes
he
knows
the
place
by
heart
his
description
of
it
is
in
his
most
methodical
style
steadily
it
all
comes
out
a
with
every
orderly
detail
duly
arranged
the
expression
of
good
manners
sound
taste
and
a
solid
position
on
such
a
world
created
as
he
knows
how
to
create
it
he
may
draw
without
hesitation
for
the
repeated
demands
of
the
story
the
protracted
havoc
wrought
by
the
man
infatuation
is
represented
step
by
step
as
the
visible
scene
is
denuded
and
destroyed
his
spirit
is
worn
away
and
his
sanity
breaks
down
and
the
successive
strokes
that
fall
on
it
instead
of
losing
force
for
the
onlooker
by
repetition
are
renewed
and
increased
by
the
sight
of
the
spreading
devastation
around
him
as
his
precious
things
are
cast
into
the
devouring
expense
of
his
researches
their
disappearance
is
the
outward
sign
of
his
own
personal
surrender
to
his
idea
and
each
time
that
he
is
thrown
back
upon
disappointment
the
ravage
of
the
scene
in
which
he
was
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
is
more
evident
than
before
it
spreads
through
his
pictures
and
treasures
to
his
family
and
still
further
into
his
relations
with
the
respectable
circle
about
him
his
position
is
shaken
his
situation
in
that
beautiful
is
undermined
it
is
slowly
shattered
as
his
madness
extends
and
having
built
and
furnished
that
world
so
firmly
and
richly
balzac
can
linger
upon
its
overthrow
as
long
as
is
necessary
for
the
rising
effect
of
his
story
he
has
created
so
much
that
there
is
plenty
to
destroy
only
at
last
with
the
man
dying
cry
of
triumph
is
the
wreck
complete
thus
the
climax
of
the
story
as
in
grandet
is
laid
up
betimes
in
the
descriptive
picture
it
is
needless
i
suppose
to
insist
on
the
esthetic
value
of
economy
of
this
kind
everybody
feels
the
greater
force
of
the
climax
that
assumes
its
right
place
without
an
effort
when
the
time
comes
compared
with
that
in
which
a
strain
and
an
exaggerated
stress
are
perceptible
the
process
of
writing
a
novel
seems
to
be
one
of
continual
forestalling
and
anticipating
far
more
important
than
the
immediate
page
is
the
page
to
come
still
in
the
distance
on
behalf
of
which
this
one
is
secretly
working
the
writer
makes
a
point
and
reserves
it
at
the
same
time
creates
an
effect
and
holds
it
back
till
in
due
course
it
is
appropriated
and
used
by
the
page
for
which
it
is
intended
it
must
be
a
pleasure
to
the
writer
it
is
certainly
a
great
pleasure
to
the
critic
when
the
stroke
is
cleanly
brought
off
it
is
the
same
pleasure
indeed
the
novelist
makes
the
stroke
but
the
critic
makes
it
again
by
perceiving
it
and
is
legitimately
satisfied
by
the
sense
of
having
perceived
it
with
good
artistry
it
is
spoilt
of
course
if
the
stroke
is
handled
tactlessly
and
obtrusively
the
art
of
preparation
is
no
art
if
it
betrays
itself
at
the
outset
calling
attention
to
its
purpose
by
definition
it
is
unrecognizable
until
it
attains
its
end
it
is
the
art
of
rendering
an
impression
that
is
found
to
have
been
made
later
on
but
that
evades
detection
at
the
moment
the
particular
variety
i
have
been
considering
is
one
of
which
balzac
is
a
great
master
and
perhaps
his
mastery
will
appear
still
more
clearly
if
i
look
at
a
book
in
which
his
example
is
followed
in
this
respect
it
is
a
finer
book
for
all
that
than
most
of
balzac
xvi
it
is
anna
karenina
and
i
turn
to
it
now
not
for
its
beauty
and
harmony
not
because
it
is
one
of
the
most
exquisitely
toned
shaded
gradated
pieces
of
portraiture
in
fiction
but
because
it
happens
to
show
very
clearly
how
an
effect
may
be
lost
for
want
of
timely
precaution
tolstoy
undoubtedly
damaged
a
magnificent
book
by
his
refusal
to
linger
over
any
kind
of
pictorial
introduction
there
is
none
in
this
story
the
reader
will
remember
the
whole
of
the
book
very
nearly
is
scenic
from
the
opening
page
to
the
last
it
is
a
chain
of
particular
occasions
acted
out
talked
out
by
the
crowd
of
people
concerned
each
of
these
scenes
is
outspread
before
the
spectator
who
watches
the
characters
and
listens
to
their
dialogue
there
is
next
to
no
generalization
of
the
story
at
any
point
on
every
page
i
think
certainly
on
all
but
a
very
few
of
the
many
hundred
pages
the
hour
and
the
place
are
exactly
defined
something
is
happening
there
or
something
is
being
discussed
at
any
rate
it
is
an
episode
singled
out
for
direct
vision
the
plan
of
the
book
in
fact
is
strictly
dramatic
it
allows
no
such
freedom
as
balzac
uses
freedom
of
exposition
and
retrospect
tolstoy
never
draws
back
from
the
immediate
scene
to
picture
the
manner
of
life
that
his
people
led
or
to
give
a
foreshortened
impression
of
their
history
he
unrolls
it
all
as
it
occurs
illustrating
everything
in
action
it
is
an
extraordinary
feat
considering
the
amount
of
experience
he
undertakes
to
display
with
an
interweaving
of
so
many
lives
and
fortunes
and
it
is
still
more
extraordinary
considering
the
nature
of
the
story
which
is
not
really
dramatic
at
all
but
a
pictorial
contrast
anna
and
her
affair
on
one
side
of
it
levin
and
his
on
the
other
the
contrast
is
gradually
extended
and
deepened
through
the
book
but
it
leads
to
no
clash
between
the
two
no
opposition
no
drama
it
is
an
effect
of
slow
and
inevitable
change
drawn
out
in
minute
detail
through
two
lives
with
all
the
others
that
cluster
round
each
exactly
the
kind
of
matter
that
nobody
but
tolstoy
with
his
huge
hand
would
think
of
trying
to
treat
scenically
tolstoy
so
treats
it
however
and
apparently
never
feels
any
desire
to
break
away
from
the
march
of
his
episodes
or
to
fuse
his
swarming
detail
into
a
general
view
it
means
that
he
must
write
a
very
long
book
with
scores
and
scores
of
scenes
but
he
has
no
objection
to
that
it
is
only
in
its
plan
of
course
that
anna
karenina
is
strictly
dramatic
its
method
of
execution
is
much
looser
and
there
indeed
tolstoy
allows
himself
as
much
freedom
as
he
pleases
in
the
novel
of
pure
drama
the
point
of
view
is
that
of
the
reader
alone
as
we
saw
there
is
no
going
behind
the
characters
no
direct
revelation
of
their
thought
such
consistency
is
out
of
the
question
however
even
for
tolstoy
on
the
great
scale
of
his
book
and
he
never
hesitates
to
lay
bare
the
mind
of
any
of
his
people
at
any
moment
if
it
seems
to
help
the
force
or
the
lucidity
of
the
scene
and
so
we
speedily
grow
familiar
with
the
consciousness
of
many
of
them
for
tolstoy
hand
is
always
as
light
and
quick
as
it
is
broad
he
catches
the
passing
thought
that
is
in
a
man
mind
as
he
speaks
and
though
it
may
be
no
more
than
a
vague
doubt
or
an
idle
fancy
it
is
somehow
a
note
of
the
man
himself
a
sign
of
his
being
an
echo
of
his
inner
tone
from
anna
and
the
other
figures
of
the
forefront
down
to
the
least
of
the
population
of
the
background
i
could
almost
say
to
the
wonderful
little
red
baby
that
in
one
of
the
last
chapters
is
disclosed
to
levin
by
the
triumphant
nurse
each
of
them
is
a
centre
of
vision
each
of
them
looks
out
on
a
world
that
is
not
like
the
world
of
the
rest
and
we
know
it
without
any
elaborate
research
tolstoy
expresses
the
nature
of
all
their
experience
he
reveals
the
dull
weight
of
it
in
one
man
life
or
its
vibrating
interest
in
another
he
shows
how
for
one
it
stirs
and
opens
with
troubling
enlargement
how
for
another
it
remains
blank
and
inert
he
does
so
unconsciously
it
might
seem
not
seeking
to
construct
the
world
as
it
appears
to
anna
or
her
husband
or
her
lover
but
simply
glancing
now
and
then
into
their
mood
of
the
moment
and
indicating
what
he
happens
to
find
there
yet
it
is
enough
and
each
of
them
is
soon
a
human
being
whose
privacy
we
share
they
are
actors
moving
upon
a
visible
scene
watched
from
the
reader
point
of
view
but
they
are
also
sentient
lives
understood
from
within
here
then
is
a
mixed
method
which
enables
tolstoy
to
deal
with
his
immense
subject
on
the
lines
of
drama
he
can
follow
its
chronology
step
by
step
at
an
even
pace
throughout
without
ever
interrupting
the
rhythm
for
that
shift
of
the
point
of
view
away
from
the
immediate
scene
to
a
more
commanding
height
which
another
writer
would
certainly
have
found
to
be
necessary
sooner
or
later
he
can
create
a
character
in
so
few
words
he
can
make
the
manner
of
a
or
a
woman
thought
so
quickly
intelligible
that
even
though
his
story
is
crowded
and
with
people
he
can
render
them
all
so
to
speak
by
the
way
give
them
all
their
due
without
any
study
of
them
outside
the
passing
episode
so
he
can
at
least
in
general
for
in
anna
karenina
as
i
said
his
method
seems
to
break
down
very
conspicuously
at
a
certain
juncture
but
before
i
come
to
that
i
would
dwell
further
upon
this
peculiar
skill
of
tolstoy
this
facility
which
explains
i
think
the
curious
flaw
in
his
beautiful
novel
he
would
appear
to
have
trusted
his
method
too
far
trusted
it
not
only
to
carry
him
through
the
development
and
the
climax
of
his
story
but
also
to
constitute
his
his
prime
situation
in
the
beginning
this
was
to
throw
too
much
upon
it
and
it
is
critically
of
high
interest
to
see
where
it
failed
and
why
the
miscalculations
of
a
great
genius
are
enlightening
here
in
anna
karenina
is
one
that
calls
attention
to
tolstoy
characteristic
fashion
of
telling
a
story
and
declares
its
remarkable
qualities
the
story
of
anna
i
suggested
is
not
essentially
dramatic
like
the
story
of
emma
bovary
or
of
eugénie
grandet
it
is
a
picture
outspread
an
impression
of
life
rather
than
an
action
anna
at
first
has
a
life
that
rests
on
many
supports
with
her
husband
and
her
child
and
her
social
possessions
it
is
broadly
based
and
its
stability
is
assured
if
she
chooses
to
rely
on
it
but
her
husband
is
a
dull
and
pedantic
soul
and
before
long
she
chooses
to
exchange
her
assured
life
for
another
that
rests
on
one
support
only
a
romantic
passion
her
life
with
vronsky
has
no
other
security
and
in
process
of
time
it
fails
its
gradual
failure
is
her
story
the
losing
battle
of
a
woman
who
has
thrown
away
more
resources
than
she
could
afford
but
the
point
and
reason
of
the
book
is
not
in
the
dramatic
question
what
will
happen
will
anna
lose
or
win
it
is
in
the
picture
of
her
gathering
and
deepening
difficulties
difficulties
that
arise
out
of
her
position
and
her
mood
difficulties
of
which
the
only
solution
is
at
last
her
death
and
this
story
with
the
contrasted
picture
of
domesticity
that
completes
it
is
laid
out
exactly
as
balzac
did
lay
out
his
story
of
eugénie
it
is
all
presented
as
action
because
tolstoy
eye
was
infallibly
drawn
whenever
he
wrote
to
the
instant
aspect
of
his
matter
the
play
itself
he
could
not
generalize
it
and
on
the
whole
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
do
so
for
there
was
nothing
not
the
least
stir
of
motive
or
character
that
could
not
be
expressed
in
the
movement
of
the
play
as
he
handled
it
scene
is
laid
to
scene
therefore
as
many
as
he
requires
he
had
no
thought
of
stinting
himself
in
that
respect
and
within
the
limit
of
the
scene
he
was
always
ready
to
vary
his
method
to
enter
the
consciousness
of
any
or
all
the
characters
at
will
without
troubling
himself
about
the
possible
confusion
of
effect
which
this
might
entail
he
could
afford
the
liberty
because
the
main
lines
of
his
structure
were
so
simple
and
clear
the
inconsistencies
of
his
method
are
dominated
by
the
broad
scenic
regularity
of
his
plan
balzac
had
not
the
of
tolstoy
in
the
management
of
a
dramatic
scene
an
episode
when
it
comes
to
rendering
a
piece
of
action
balzac
art
is
not
particularly
felicitous
and
if
we
only
became
acquainted
with
his
people
while
they
are
talking
and
acting
i
think
they
might
often
seem
rather
heavy
and
wooden
harsh
of
speech
and
gesture
balzac
knowledge
of
them
and
his
power
of
offering
an
impression
of
what
he
knows
these
are
so
great
that
his
people
are
alive
before
they
begin
to
act
alive
with
an
energy
that
is
tolstoy
grasp
of
a
human
being
whole
existence
of
everything
that
goes
to
make
it
is
not
as
capacious
as
balzac
but
on
the
other
hand
he
can
create
a
living
scene
exquisitely
and
easily
expressive
out
of
anything
whatever
the
lightest
trifle
of
an
incident
if
he
describes
how
a
child
lingered
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
teasing
an
old
servant
or
how
a
stood
in
a
doorway
laughing
and
calling
to
the
men
at
work
in
the
farmyard
the
thing
becomes
a
poetic
event
in
half
a
page
he
makes
an
unforgettable
scene
it
suddenly
glows
and
flushes
and
its
effect
in
the
story
is
profound
a
passing
glimpse
of
this
kind
is
caught
say
by
anna
in
her
hungry
desperation
by
levin
as
he
wanders
and
speculates
and
immediately
their
experience
is
the
fuller
by
an
eloquent
memory
the
vividness
of
the
small
scene
becomes
a
part
of
them
for
us
who
read
it
is
something
added
to
our
impression
of
their
reality
and
so
the
is
not
a
diversion
or
an
interlude
it
speeds
the
story
by
augmenting
the
tone
and
the
value
of
the
lives
that
we
are
watching
it
happens
again
and
again
that
is
tolstoy
way
of
creating
a
life
of
raising
it
to
its
full
power
by
a
gradual
process
of
enrichment
till
anna
or
levin
is
at
length
a
complete
being
intimately
understood
ready
for
the
climax
of
the
tale
but
of
course
it
takes
time
and
it
chanced
that
this
deliberation
made
a
special
difficulty
in
the
case
of
anna
story
as
for
levin
it
was
easy
to
give
him
ample
play
he
could
be
left
to
emerge
and
to
assume
his
place
in
the
book
by
leisurely
degrees
for
it
is
not
until
much
has
passed
that
his
full
power
is
needed
meanwhile
he
is
a
figure
in
the
crowd
a
shy
and
disappointed
suitor
unobtrusively
sympathetic
and
there
are
long
opportunities
of
seeing
more
of
him
in
his
country
solitude
later
on
when
his
fortunes
come
to
the
front
with
his
marriage
he
has
shown
what
he
is
he
steps
fully
fashioned
into
the
drama
with
anna
it
is
very
different
her
story
allows
no
such
pause
for
a
growing
knowledge
of
the
manner
of
woman
she
may
be
she
is
at
once
to
the
front
of
the
book
the
situation
out
of
which
the
whole
novel
develops
is
made
by
a
particular
crisis
in
her
life
she
meets
and
falls
in
love
with
vronsky
that
is
the
crisis
from
which
the
rest
of
her
story
proceeds
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
action
the
subject
of
the
earliest
chapters
and
the
difficulty
lies
in
this
that
she
must
be
represented
upon
such
a
critical
height
of
emotion
before
there
is
time
by
tolstoy
method
to
create
the
right
effect
for
her
and
to
make
her
impulse
really
intelligible
for
the
reader
it
is
all
too
abrupt
the
step
by
which
she
abandons
her
past
and
flings
herself
upon
her
tragic
adventure
it
is
impossible
to
measure
her
passion
and
her
resolution
because
she
herself
is
still
incompletely
rendered
she
has
appeared
in
a
few
charming
scenes
a
finished
and
graceful
figure
but
that
is
not
enough
if
she
is
so
soon
to
be
seen
at
this
pitch
of
exaltation
it
is
essential
that
her
life
should
be
fully
shared
by
the
onlooker
but
as
tolstoy
has
told
the
story
anna
is
in
the
midst
of
her
crisis
and
has
passed
it
before
it
is
possible
to
know
her
life
clearly
from
within
alive
and
beautiful
she
is
from
the
very
first
moment
of
her
appearance
tolstoy
art
is
much
too
sure
to
miss
the
right
effect
so
far
as
it
goes
and
if
her
story
were
such
that
it
involved
her
in
no
great
adventure
at
the
start
if
she
could
pass
from
scene
to
scene
like
levin
quietly
revealing
herself
tolstoy
method
would
be
perfect
but
as
it
is
there
is
no
adequate
preparation
anna
is
made
to
act
as
a
deeply
stirred
and
agitated
woman
before
she
has
the
for
such
emotions
she
has
not
yet
become
a
presence
familiar
enough
and
there
is
no
means
of
gauging
the
force
of
the
storm
that
is
seen
to
shake
her
it
is
a
flaw
in
the
book
which
has
often
been
noticed
and
it
is
a
flaw
which
tolstoy
could
hardly
have
avoided
if
he
was
determined
to
hold
to
his
scenic
plan
given
his
reluctance
to
leave
the
actually
present
occasion
from
the
first
page
onwards
from
the
moment
erring
brother
wakes
to
his
own
domestic
troubles
at
the
opening
of
the
book
there
is
not
room
for
the
due
creation
of
anna
life
her
must
be
reached
without
delay
it
can
not
be
deferred
for
it
is
there
that
the
development
of
the
book
begins
all
that
precedes
her
union
with
vronsky
is
nothing
but
the
opening
stage
the
matter
that
must
be
displayed
before
the
story
can
begin
to
expand
the
story
as
we
have
seen
is
in
the
picture
of
anna
life
her
critical
choice
so
that
the
first
part
of
the
book
the
account
of
the
given
situation
can
not
extend
its
limits
if
therefore
the
situation
is
to
be
really
made
and
constituted
the
space
it
may
cover
must
be
tightly
packed
the
method
should
be
that
which
most
condenses
and
concentrates
the
representation
a
great
deal
is
to
be
expressed
at
once
all
anna
past
and
present
the
kind
of
experience
that
has
made
her
and
that
has
brought
her
to
the
point
she
now
touches
without
this
her
action
is
arbitrary
and
meaningless
it
is
vain
to
say
that
she
acted
thus
and
thus
unless
we
perfectly
understand
what
she
was
what
she
had
what
was
around
her
in
the
face
of
her
predicament
obviously
there
is
no
space
to
lose
and
it
is
enough
to
look
at
tolstoy
use
of
it
and
then
to
see
how
balzac
makes
the
situation
that
requires
the
contrast
shows
exactly
where
tolstoy
method
could
not
help
him
his
refusal
to
shape
his
story
or
any
considerable
part
of
it
as
a
pictorial
impression
his
desire
to
keep
it
all
in
immediate
action
prevents
him
from
making
the
most
of
the
space
at
his
command
the
situation
is
bound
to
suffer
in
consequence
for
suppose
that
balzac
had
had
to
deal
with
the
life
of
anna
he
would
certainly
have
been
in
no
hurry
to
plunge
into
the
action
he
would
have
felt
that
there
was
much
to
treat
before
the
scene
was
ready
to
open
all
the
initial
episodes
of
tolstoy
book
from
first
appearance
until
she
drops
into
vronsky
arms
balzac
might
well
have
ignored
entirely
he
would
have
been
too
busy
with
his
prodigious
summary
of
the
history
and
household
of
the
karenins
to
permit
himself
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
any
particular
moment
until
the
story
could
unfold
from
a
situation
thoroughly
prepared
if
tolstoy
had
followed
this
course
we
should
have
lost
some
enchanting
glimpses
but
balzac
would
have
left
not
a
shadow
of
uncertainty
in
the
matter
of
anna
disastrous
passion
he
would
have
shown
precisely
how
she
was
placed
in
the
conditions
of
her
past
how
she
was
exposed
to
this
new
incursion
from
without
and
how
it
broke
up
a
life
which
had
satisfied
her
till
then
he
would
have
started
his
action
in
due
time
with
his
whole
preliminary
effect
completely
rendered
there
would
be
no
more
question
of
it
no
possibility
that
it
would
prove
inadequate
for
the
sequel
and
all
this
he
would
have
managed
no
doubt
in
fewer
pages
than
tolstoy
needs
for
the
beautiful
scenes
of
his
earlier
chapters
scenes
which
make
a
perfect
impression
of
anna
and
her
circle
as
an
onlooker
might
happen
to
see
them
but
which
fail
to
give
the
onlooker
the
kind
of
intimacy
that
is
needed
later
on
indeed
her
life
is
penetrated
to
the
depths
but
then
it
is
too
late
to
save
the
effect
of
the
beginning
to
the
very
end
anna
is
a
wonderful
woman
whose
early
history
has
never
been
fully
explained
the
facts
are
clear
of
course
and
there
is
nothing
impossible
about
them
but
her
passion
for
this
man
the
grand
event
of
her
life
has
to
be
assumed
on
the
word
of
the
author
all
that
he
really
showed
to
start
with
was
a
slight
swift
which
might
have
ended
as
easily
as
it
began
the
method
of
the
book
in
short
does
not
arise
out
of
the
subject
in
treating
it
tolstoy
simply
used
the
method
that
was
congenial
to
him
without
regarding
the
story
that
he
had
to
tell
he
began
it
as
though
anna
break
with
her
past
was
the
climax
to
which
the
story
was
to
mount
whereas
it
is
really
the
point
from
which
the
story
sets
out
for
its
true
climax
in
her
final
catastrophe
and
so
the
first
part
of
the
book
is
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
it
is
not
an
independent
drama
for
it
can
not
reach
its
height
through
all
the
necessary
sweep
of
development
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
a
sufficient
preparation
for
the
great
picture
of
inevitable
disaster
which
is
to
follow
tolstoy
doubtless
counted
on
his
power
and
not
without
reason
for
it
is
amazing
to
call
people
into
life
by
means
of
a
few
luminous
episodes
he
knew
he
could
make
a
living
creature
of
anna
by
bringing
her
into
view
in
half
a
dozen
scenes
she
descends
accordingly
upon
her
brother
agitated
household
like
a
beneficent
angel
she
shines
resplendent
at
some
social
function
she
meets
vronsky
she
talks
to
her
husband
and
tolstoy
is
right
she
becomes
a
real
and
exquisite
being
forthwith
but
he
did
not
see
how
much
more
was
needed
than
a
simple
personal
impression
of
her
in
view
of
all
that
is
to
come
not
she
only
but
her
world
the
world
as
she
sees
it
her
past
as
it
affects
her
this
too
is
demanded
and
for
this
he
makes
no
provision
it
is
never
really
shown
how
she
was
placed
in
her
life
and
what
it
meant
to
her
and
her
flare
of
passion
has
consequently
no
importance
no
fateful
bigness
there
is
not
enough
of
her
as
yet
for
such
a
crisis
it
is
not
because
vronsky
seems
an
inadequate
object
of
her
passion
though
it
is
true
that
with
the
figure
of
vronsky
tolstoy
was
curiously
unsuccessful
vronsky
was
his
one
failure
there
is
surely
no
other
in
all
his
gallery
to
match
it
the
spoilt
child
of
the
world
but
a
friendly
soul
and
a
romantic
and
a
patient
lover
and
a
type
fashioned
by
conditions
that
tolstoy
of
course
knew
by
heart
why
should
tolstoy
manage
to
make
so
little
of
him
it
is
unfortunate
for
when
anna
is
stirred
by
the
sight
of
him
and
his
speciosity
any
reader
is
sure
to
protest
tolstoy
should
have
created
vronsky
with
a
more
certain
touch
before
he
allowed
him
to
cause
such
a
disturbance
but
this
is
a
minor
matter
and
it
would
count
for
little
if
the
figure
of
anna
were
all
it
should
be
vronsky
importance
in
the
story
is
his
importance
to
anna
and
her
view
of
him
is
a
part
of
and
he
might
be
left
lightly
treated
on
his
own
account
the
author
might
be
content
to
indicate
him
rather
summarily
so
long
as
anna
had
full
attention
it
returns
upon
that
again
if
anna
own
life
were
really
fashioned
effect
would
be
and
the
independent
effect
he
happens
to
make
or
to
fail
to
make
on
the
reader
would
be
an
irrelevant
affair
tolstoy
vital
failure
is
not
with
him
but
with
her
in
the
prelude
of
his
book
it
may
be
that
there
is
something
of
the
same
kind
to
be
seen
in
another
of
his
novels
in
resurrection
though
resurrection
is
more
like
a
fragment
of
an
epic
than
a
novel
it
can
not
be
said
that
in
that
tremendous
book
tolstoy
pictured
the
rending
of
a
man
soul
by
sudden
enlightenment
striking
in
upon
him
unexpectedly
against
his
will
and
destroying
his
established
life
and
that
is
apparently
the
subject
in
the
author
mind
it
is
the
woman
the
accidental
woman
through
whom
the
stroke
is
delivered
who
is
actually
in
the
middle
of
the
book
it
is
epic
much
rather
than
the
man
and
tolstoy
did
not
succeed
in
placing
him
where
he
clearly
meant
him
to
be
the
conversion
from
the
selfishness
of
his
commonplace
prosperity
is
not
much
more
than
a
fact
assumed
at
the
beginning
of
the
story
it
happens
tolstoy
says
it
happens
and
the
man
life
is
changed
and
thereafter
the
sombre
epic
proceeds
but
the
unrolling
of
the
story
has
no
bearing
upon
the
revolution
wrought
in
the
man
that
is
complete
as
soon
as
he
flings
over
his
past
and
follows
the
convoy
of
prisoners
into
siberia
and
the
succession
of
strange
scenes
has
nothing
more
to
accomplish
in
him
the
man
is
the
mirror
of
the
scenes
his
own
drama
is
finished
and
if
tolstoy
intended
to
write
the
drama
of
a
soul
all
this
presentation
of
the
deadly
journey
into
exile
given
with
the
full
force
of
his
genius
is
superfluous
his
subject
lay
further
back
but
resurrection
no
doubt
a
fragment
a
wonderful
shifting
of
scenes
that
never
reached
a
conclusion
and
it
is
not
to
be
criticized
as
a
book
in
which
tolstoy
tried
and
failed
to
carry
out
his
purpose
i
only
mention
it
because
it
seems
to
illustrate
like
anna
karenina
his
instinctive
evasion
of
the
matter
that
could
not
be
thrown
into
straightforward
scenic
form
the
form
in
which
his
imagination
was
evidently
happiest
his
great
example
therefore
is
complementary
to
that
of
balzac
whose
genius
looked
in
the
other
direction
who
was
always
drawn
to
the
general
picture
rather
than
to
the
particular
scene
and
with
these
two
illustrious
names
i
reach
the
end
of
the
argument
i
have
tried
to
follow
from
book
to
book
and
it
is
time
to
gather
up
the
threads
xvii
the
whole
intricate
question
of
method
in
the
craft
of
fiction
i
take
to
be
governed
by
the
question
of
the
point
of
view
the
question
of
the
relation
in
which
the
narrator
stands
to
the
story
he
tells
it
as
sees
it
in
the
first
place
the
reader
faces
the
and
listens
and
the
story
may
be
told
so
vivaciously
that
the
presence
of
the
minstrel
is
forgotten
and
the
scene
becomes
visible
peopled
with
the
characters
of
the
tale
it
may
be
so
it
very
often
is
so
for
a
time
but
it
is
not
so
always
and
the
himself
grows
conscious
of
a
misgiving
if
the
spell
is
weakened
at
any
moment
the
listener
is
recalled
from
the
scene
to
the
mere
author
before
him
and
the
story
rests
only
upon
the
author
direct
assertion
is
it
not
possible
then
to
introduce
another
point
of
view
to
set
up
a
fresh
narrator
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
scrutiny
if
the
is
the
story
himself
the
author
is
dramatized
his
assertions
gain
in
weight
for
they
are
backed
by
the
presence
of
the
narrator
in
the
pictured
scene
it
is
advantage
scored
the
author
has
shifted
his
responsibility
and
it
now
falls
where
the
reader
can
see
and
measure
it
the
arbitrary
quality
which
may
at
any
time
be
detected
in
the
author
voice
is
disguised
in
the
voice
of
his
spokesman
nothing
is
now
imported
into
the
story
from
without
it
is
it
has
no
associations
with
anyone
beyond
its
circle
such
is
the
first
step
towards
dramatization
and
in
very
many
a
story
it
may
be
enough
the
spokesman
is
there
in
recognizable
relation
with
his
matter
no
question
of
his
authority
can
arise
but
now
a
difficulty
may
be
started
by
the
nature
of
the
tale
that
he
tells
if
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
relate
what
he
has
seen
what
anyone
might
have
seen
in
his
position
his
account
will
serve
very
well
there
is
no
need
for
more
let
him
unfold
his
chronicle
as
it
appears
in
his
memory
but
if
he
is
himself
the
subject
of
his
story
if
the
story
involves
a
searching
exploration
of
his
own
consciousness
an
account
in
his
own
words
after
the
fact
is
not
by
any
means
the
best
imaginable
far
better
it
would
be
to
see
him
while
his
mind
is
actually
at
work
in
the
agitation
whatever
it
may
be
which
is
to
make
the
book
the
matter
would
then
be
objective
and
visible
to
the
reader
instead
of
reaching
him
in
the
form
of
a
report
at
second
hand
but
how
to
manage
this
without
falling
back
upon
the
author
and
report
which
has
already
been
tried
and
for
good
reasons
as
it
seemed
abandoned
it
is
managed
by
a
kind
of
repetition
of
the
same
stroke
a
further
shift
of
the
point
of
view
the
spectator
the
listener
the
reader
is
now
himself
to
be
placed
at
the
angle
of
vision
not
an
account
or
a
report
more
or
less
convincing
is
to
be
offered
him
but
a
direct
sight
of
the
matter
itself
while
it
is
passing
nobody
expounds
or
explains
the
story
is
enacted
by
its
look
and
behaviour
at
particular
moments
by
the
first
stroke
the
narrator
was
brought
into
the
book
and
set
before
the
reader
but
the
action
appeared
only
in
his
narrative
now
the
action
is
there
proceeding
while
the
pages
are
turned
the
narrator
is
forestalled
he
is
watched
while
the
story
is
in
the
making
such
is
the
progress
of
the
writer
of
fiction
towards
drama
such
is
his
method
of
evading
the
drawbacks
of
a
mere
reporter
and
assuming
the
advantages
as
far
as
possible
of
a
dramatist
how
far
he
may
choose
to
push
the
process
in
his
book
that
is
a
matter
to
be
decided
by
the
subject
it
entirely
depends
upon
the
kind
of
effect
that
the
theme
demands
it
may
respond
to
all
the
dramatization
it
can
get
it
may
give
all
that
it
has
to
give
for
less
the
subject
dictates
the
method
and
now
let
the
process
be
reversed
let
us
start
with
the
purely
dramatic
subject
the
story
that
will
tell
itself
in
perfect
rightness
unaided
to
the
eye
of
the
reader
this
story
never
deviates
from
a
strictly
scenic
form
one
occasion
or
episode
follows
another
with
no
interruption
for
any
reflective
summary
of
events
necessarily
it
must
be
so
for
it
is
only
while
the
episode
is
proceeding
that
no
question
of
a
narrator
can
arise
when
the
scene
closes
the
play
ceases
till
the
opening
of
the
next
to
glance
upon
the
story
from
a
height
and
to
give
a
general
impression
of
its
course
this
is
at
once
to
remove
the
point
of
view
from
the
reader
and
to
set
up
a
new
one
somewhere
else
the
method
is
no
longer
consistent
no
longer
purely
dramatic
and
the
dramatic
story
is
not
only
scenic
it
is
also
limited
to
so
much
as
the
ear
can
hear
and
the
eye
see
in
rigid
drama
of
this
kind
there
is
naturally
no
admission
of
the
reader
into
the
private
mind
of
any
of
the
characters
their
thoughts
and
motives
are
transmuted
into
action
a
subject
wrought
to
this
pitch
of
objectivity
is
no
doubt
given
weight
and
compactness
and
authority
in
the
highest
degree
it
is
like
a
piece
of
modelling
standing
in
clear
space
casting
its
shadow
it
is
the
most
finished
form
that
fiction
can
take
but
evidently
it
is
not
a
form
to
which
fiction
can
aspire
in
general
it
implies
many
sacrifices
and
these
will
easily
seem
to
be
more
than
the
subject
can
usefully
make
it
is
out
of
the
question
of
course
wherever
the
main
burden
of
the
story
lies
within
some
particular
consciousness
in
the
study
of
a
soul
the
growth
of
a
character
the
changing
history
of
a
temperament
there
the
subject
would
be
needlessly
crossed
and
strangled
by
dramatization
pushed
to
its
limit
it
is
out
of
the
question
again
wherever
the
story
is
too
big
too
comprehensive
too
widely
ranging
to
be
treated
scenically
with
no
opportunity
for
general
and
panoramic
survey
it
has
been
discovered
indeed
that
even
a
story
of
this
kind
fall
into
a
long
succession
of
definite
scenes
under
some
hands
but
it
has
also
appeared
that
in
doing
so
it
incurs
unnecessary
disabilities
and
will
likely
suffer
these
stories
therefore
which
will
not
naturally
accommodate
themselves
to
the
reader
point
of
view
and
the
alone
we
regard
as
rather
pictorial
than
dramatic
meaning
that
they
call
for
some
narrator
somebody
who
to
contemplate
the
facts
and
create
an
impression
of
them
whether
it
is
the
omniscient
author
or
a
man
in
the
book
he
must
gather
up
his
experience
compose
a
vision
of
it
as
it
exists
in
his
mind
and
lay
before
the
reader
it
is
the
reflection
of
an
experience
and
though
there
may
be
all
imaginable
diversity
of
treatment
within
the
limits
of
the
reflection
such
is
its
essential
character
in
a
pictorial
book
the
principle
of
the
structure
involves
a
point
of
view
which
is
not
the
reader
it
is
open
to
the
pictorial
book
however
to
use
a
method
in
its
that
is
really
no
other
than
the
method
of
drama
it
is
somebody
experience
we
say
that
is
to
be
reported
the
general
effect
that
many
things
have
left
upon
a
certain
mind
it
is
a
fusion
of
innumerable
elements
the
deposit
of
a
lapse
of
time
the
straightforward
way
to
render
it
would
be
for
the
narrator
the
author
or
his
selected
creature
to
view
the
past
retrospectively
and
discourse
upon
it
to
recall
and
meditate
and
summarize
that
is
in
its
natural
form
using
its
own
method
but
exactly
as
in
drama
the
subject
is
distributed
among
the
characters
and
enacted
by
them
so
in
picture
the
effect
may
be
entrusted
to
the
elements
the
reactions
of
the
moment
and
by
these
the
mind
of
the
narrator
becomes
the
stage
his
voice
is
no
longer
heard
his
voice
heard
so
long
as
there
is
narrative
of
any
sort
whether
he
is
speaking
in
person
or
is
reported
obliquely
his
voice
is
heard
because
in
either
case
the
language
and
the
intonation
are
his
the
direct
expression
of
his
experience
in
the
drama
of
his
mind
there
is
no
personal
voice
for
there
is
no
narrator
the
point
of
view
becomes
the
reader
once
more
the
shapes
of
thought
in
the
man
mind
tell
their
own
story
and
that
is
the
art
of
when
it
uses
the
dramatic
method
but
it
can
not
always
do
so
constantly
it
must
be
necessary
to
offer
the
reader
a
summary
of
facts
an
impression
of
a
train
of
events
that
can
only
be
given
as
somebody
narration
suppose
it
were
required
to
render
the
general
effect
of
a
certain
year
in
a
life
a
year
that
has
filled
his
mind
with
a
swarm
of
many
memories
looking
into
his
consciousness
after
the
year
has
gone
we
might
find
much
there
that
would
indicate
the
nature
of
the
year
events
without
any
word
on
his
part
the
flickers
and
flashes
of
thought
from
moment
to
moment
might
indeed
tell
us
much
but
we
shall
need
an
account
from
him
too
no
doubt
too
much
has
happened
in
a
year
to
be
wholly
acted
as
i
call
it
in
the
movement
of
the
man
thought
he
must
narrate
he
must
make
that
is
to
say
a
picture
of
the
events
as
he
sees
them
glancing
back
now
if
he
speaks
in
the
first
person
there
can
of
course
be
no
uncertainty
in
the
point
of
view
he
has
his
fixed
position
he
can
not
leave
it
his
description
will
represent
the
face
that
the
facts
in
their
sequence
turned
towards
the
field
of
vision
is
defined
with
perfect
distinctness
and
his
story
can
not
stray
outside
it
the
reader
then
may
be
said
to
watch
a
reflection
of
the
facts
in
a
mirror
of
which
the
edge
is
nowhere
in
doubt
it
is
rounded
by
the
bounds
of
the
narrator
own
personal
experience
this
limitation
may
have
a
convenience
and
a
value
in
the
story
it
may
contribute
to
the
effect
but
it
need
not
be
forfeited
it
is
clear
if
the
first
person
is
changed
to
the
third
the
author
may
use
the
man
field
of
vision
and
keep
as
faithfully
within
it
as
though
the
man
were
speaking
for
himself
in
that
case
he
retains
this
advantage
and
adds
to
it
another
one
that
is
likely
to
be
very
much
greater
for
now
while
the
point
of
view
is
still
fixed
in
space
still
assigned
to
the
man
in
the
book
it
is
free
in
there
no
longer
stretches
between
the
narrator
and
the
events
of
which
he
speaks
a
certain
tract
of
time
across
which
the
past
must
appear
in
a
more
or
less
distant
perspective
all
the
variety
obtainable
by
a
shifting
relation
to
the
story
in
time
is
thus
in
the
author
hand
the
safe
serenity
of
a
far
retrospect
the
promising
or
threatening
urgency
of
the
present
every
gradation
between
the
two
can
be
drawn
into
the
whole
effect
of
the
book
and
all
of
it
without
any
change
of
the
seeing
eye
it
is
a
liberty
that
may
help
the
story
indefinitely
raising
this
matter
into
strong
relief
throwing
that
other
back
into
vaguer
shade
and
next
still
keeping
mainly
and
ostensibly
to
the
same
point
of
view
the
author
has
the
chance
of
using
a
much
greater
latitude
than
he
need
appear
to
use
the
seeing
eye
is
with
somebody
in
the
book
but
its
vision
is
reinforced
the
picture
contains
more
becomes
richer
and
fuller
because
it
is
the
author
as
well
as
his
creature
both
at
once
nobody
notices
but
in
fact
there
are
now
two
brains
behind
that
eye
and
one
of
them
is
the
author
who
adopts
and
shares
the
of
his
creature
and
at
the
same
time
supplements
his
wit
if
you
analyse
the
picture
that
is
now
presented
you
find
that
it
is
not
all
the
work
of
the
personage
whose
vision
the
author
has
adopted
there
are
touches
in
it
that
go
beyond
any
sensation
of
his
and
indicate
that
some
one
else
is
looking
over
his
shoulder
seeing
things
from
the
same
angle
but
seeing
more
bringing
another
mind
to
bear
upon
the
scene
it
is
an
easy
and
natural
extension
of
the
personage
power
of
observation
the
impression
of
the
scene
may
be
deepened
as
much
as
need
be
it
is
not
confined
to
the
scope
of
one
mind
and
yet
there
is
no
blurring
of
the
focus
by
a
double
point
of
view
and
thus
what
i
have
called
the
sound
of
the
narrator
voice
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
this
mixture
of
metaphors
is
less
insistent
in
oblique
narration
even
while
it
seems
to
be
following
the
very
same
argument
that
it
would
in
direct
because
another
voice
is
speedily
mixed
and
blended
with
it
so
this
is
another
resource
upon
which
the
author
may
draw
according
to
his
need
sometimes
it
will
be
indispensable
and
generally
i
suppose
it
will
be
useful
it
means
that
he
keeps
a
certain
hold
upon
the
narrator
an
the
sentient
character
in
the
story
round
whom
it
is
grouped
is
not
utterly
subjective
completely
given
over
to
the
business
of
seeing
and
feeling
on
behalf
of
the
reader
it
is
a
considerable
point
for
it
helps
to
meet
one
of
the
great
difficulties
in
the
story
which
is
carefully
aligned
towards
a
single
consciousness
and
consistently
so
viewed
in
that
story
the
man
or
woman
who
acts
as
the
vessel
of
sensation
is
always
in
danger
of
seeming
a
light
uncertain
weight
compared
with
the
other
people
in
the
book
simply
because
the
other
people
are
objective
images
plainly
outlined
while
the
seer
in
the
midst
is
precluded
from
that
advantage
and
must
see
without
being
directly
seen
he
who
doubtless
ought
to
bulk
in
the
story
more
massively
than
any
one
tends
to
remain
the
least
recognizable
of
the
company
and
even
to
dissolve
in
a
kind
of
impalpable
blur
by
his
method
which
i
am
supposing
to
have
been
adopted
in
full
strictness
the
author
is
of
course
forbidden
to
look
this
central
figure
in
the
face
to
describe
and
discuss
him
the
light
can
not
be
turned
upon
him
immediately
and
very
often
we
see
the
method
becoming
an
embarrassment
to
the
author
in
consequence
and
the
devices
by
which
he
tries
to
mitigate
it
and
to
secure
some
reflected
sight
of
the
seer
may
even
be
tiresomely
obvious
but
the
resource
of
which
i
speak
is
of
a
finer
sort
it
gives
to
the
author
the
power
of
imperceptibly
edging
away
from
the
seer
leaving
his
consciousness
ceasing
to
use
his
eyes
though
still
without
substituting
the
eyes
of
another
to
revert
for
a
moment
to
the
story
told
in
the
first
person
it
is
plain
that
in
that
case
the
narrator
has
no
such
liberty
his
own
consciousness
must
always
lie
open
the
part
that
he
plays
in
the
story
can
never
appear
in
the
same
terms
on
the
same
plane
as
that
of
the
other
people
though
he
is
not
visible
in
the
story
to
the
reader
as
the
others
are
he
is
at
every
moment
than
they
in
his
capacity
of
the
seeing
eye
the
channel
of
vision
nor
can
he
put
off
his
function
he
must
continue
steadily
to
see
and
to
report
but
when
the
author
is
reporting
there
is
a
margin
of
freedom
the
author
has
not
so
completely
identified
himself
as
narrator
with
his
hero
that
he
can
give
him
no
objective
weight
whatever
if
necessary
he
can
allow
him
something
of
the
value
of
a
detached
and
phenomenal
personage
like
the
rest
of
the
company
in
the
story
and
that
without
violating
the
principle
of
his
method
he
can
not
make
his
hero
actually
visible
there
the
method
is
uncompromising
he
can
not
step
forward
leaving
the
man
point
of
view
and
picture
him
from
without
but
he
can
place
the
man
at
the
same
distance
from
the
reader
as
the
other
people
he
can
almost
lend
him
the
same
effect
he
can
make
of
him
a
dramatic
actor
upon
the
scene
and
how
merely
by
closing
when
it
suits
him
the
open
consciousness
of
the
seer
which
he
can
do
without
any
look
of
awkwardness
or
violence
since
it
conflicts
in
no
way
with
the
rule
of
the
method
that
rule
only
required
that
the
author
having
decided
to
share
the
point
of
view
of
his
character
should
not
proceed
to
set
up
another
of
his
own
it
did
not
debar
him
from
allowing
his
hero
act
of
vision
to
lapse
his
function
as
the
sentient
creature
in
the
story
to
be
intermitted
the
hero
i
call
him
so
for
convenience
he
may
of
course
be
quite
a
subordinate
onlooker
in
the
story
can
at
any
moment
become
impenetrable
a
human
being
whose
thought
is
sealed
from
us
and
it
may
seem
a
small
matter
but
in
fact
it
has
the
result
that
he
drops
into
the
plane
of
the
people
whom
he
has
hitherto
been
seeing
and
judging
hitherto
subjective
communicative
in
solitude
he
has
been
in
a
category
apart
from
them
but
now
he
may
mingle
with
the
rest
engage
in
talk
with
them
and
his
presence
and
his
talk
are
no
more
to
the
fore
than
theirs
as
soon
as
some
description
or
discussion
of
them
is
required
then
of
course
the
seer
must
resume
his
part
and
unseal
his
mind
but
meanwhile
though
the
reader
gets
no
direct
view
of
him
still
he
is
there
in
the
dialogue
with
the
rest
his
speech
like
theirs
issues
from
a
hidden
mind
and
has
the
same
dramatic
value
it
is
enough
very
likely
to
harden
our
image
of
him
to
give
precision
to
his
form
to
save
him
from
dissipation
into
that
luminous
blur
of
which
i
spoke
just
now
for
the
author
it
is
a
resource
to
be
welcomed
on
that
account
and
not
on
that
account
alone
for
besides
the
greater
definition
that
the
seer
acquires
thus
detached
from
us
at
times
and
relegated
to
the
plane
of
his
companions
there
is
much
benefit
for
the
subject
of
the
story
in
the
tale
that
is
quite
openly
and
nakedly
somebody
narrative
there
is
this
inherent
weakness
that
a
scene
of
true
drama
is
impossible
in
true
drama
nobody
the
scene
it
it
is
constituted
by
the
aspect
of
the
occasion
and
the
talk
and
the
conduct
of
the
people
when
one
of
the
people
who
took
part
in
it
sets
out
to
report
the
scene
there
is
at
once
a
mixture
and
a
confusion
of
effects
for
his
own
contribution
to
the
scene
has
a
different
quality
from
the
rest
can
not
have
the
same
crispness
and
freshness
can
not
strike
in
with
a
new
or
unexpected
note
this
weakness
may
be
well
disguised
and
like
everything
else
in
the
whole
craft
it
may
become
a
positive
and
right
effect
in
a
particular
story
for
a
particular
purpose
it
is
always
there
however
and
it
means
that
the
full
and
unmixed
effect
of
drama
is
denied
to
the
story
that
is
rigidly
told
from
the
point
of
view
of
one
of
the
actors
but
when
that
point
of
view
is
held
in
the
manner
i
have
described
when
it
is
open
to
the
author
to
withdraw
from
it
silently
and
to
leave
the
actor
to
play
his
part
true
drama
or
something
so
like
it
that
it
passes
for
true
drama
is
always
possible
all
the
figures
of
the
scene
are
together
in
it
one
no
nearer
than
another
nothing
is
wanting
save
only
that
direct
unequivocal
sight
of
the
hero
which
the
method
does
indeed
absolutely
forbid
finally
there
is
the
old
immemorial
unguarded
unsuspicious
way
of
telling
a
story
where
the
author
entertains
the
reader
the
minstrel
draws
his
audience
round
him
the
listeners
rely
upon
his
word
the
voice
is
then
confessedly
and
alone
the
author
he
imposes
no
limitation
upon
his
freedom
to
tell
what
he
pleases
and
to
regard
his
matter
from
a
point
of
view
that
is
solely
his
own
and
if
there
is
anyone
who
can
proceed
in
this
fashion
without
appearing
to
lose
the
least
of
the
advantages
of
a
more
cautious
style
for
him
the
minstrel
licence
is
proper
and
appropriate
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
but
we
have
yet
to
discover
him
and
it
is
not
very
presumptuous
in
a
critic
as
things
are
to
declare
that
a
story
will
never
yield
its
best
to
a
writer
who
takes
the
easiest
way
with
it
he
curtails
his
privileges
and
chooses
a
narrower
method
and
immediately
the
story
responds
its
better
condition
is
too
notable
to
be
forgotten
when
once
it
has
caught
the
attention
of
a
reader
the
advantages
that
it
gains
are
not
nameless
indefinable
graces
pleasing
to
a
critic
but
impossible
to
fix
in
words
they
are
solid
we
can
describe
and
recount
them
and
i
can
only
conclude
that
if
the
novel
is
still
as
full
of
energy
as
it
seems
to
be
and
is
not
a
form
of
imaginative
art
that
having
seen
the
best
of
its
day
is
preparing
to
give
place
to
some
other
the
novelist
will
not
be
willing
to
miss
the
inexhaustible
opportunity
that
lies
in
its
treatment
the
easy
way
is
no
way
at
all
the
only
way
is
that
by
which
the
most
is
made
of
the
story
to
be
told
and
the
most
was
never
made
of
any
story
except
by
a
choice
and
disciplined
method
xviii
in
these
pages
i
have
tried
to
disengage
the
various
elements
of
the
craft
one
from
another
and
to
look
at
them
separately
and
this
has
involved
much
rude
simplification
of
matters
that
are
by
no
means
simple
i
have
chosen
a
novel
for
the
sake
of
some
particular
aspect
and
i
have
disregarded
all
else
in
it
i
could
but
seek
for
the
book
which
seemed
to
display
that
aspect
most
plainly
and
keep
it
in
view
from
that
one
angle
for
illustration
of
my
theme
and
the
result
is
no
doubt
that
while
some
tentative
classification
of
the
ways
of
a
novelist
has
been
possible
the
question
that
now
arises
at
the
point
i
have
reached
must
be
left
almost
untouched
it
is
the
question
that
confronts
a
writer
when
he
has
possessed
himself
of
his
subject
and
determined
the
point
of
view
from
which
it
is
to
be
approached
how
is
its
development
to
be
handled
granted
that
the
instruments
of
the
craft
dramatic
and
pictorial
and
so
forth
are
such
as
they
have
been
described
which
of
them
is
the
appropriate
one
for
this
or
that
stage
in
the
progress
of
the
story
to
be
told
the
point
of
view
gives
only
a
general
indication
deciding
the
look
that
the
story
is
to
wear
as
a
whole
but
whether
the
action
is
to
run
scenically
or
to
be
treated
on
broader
lines
or
both
in
short
the
matter
of
the
treatment
in
detail
is
still
unsettled
though
the
main
look
and
attitude
of
the
book
has
been
fixed
by
its
subject
my
analysis
of
the
making
of
a
few
novels
would
have
to
be
pushed
very
much
further
before
it
would
be
possible
to
reach
more
than
one
or
two
conclusions
in
this
connection
in
the
handling
of
his
book
a
novelist
must
have
some
working
theory
i
suppose
to
guide
him
some
theory
of
the
relative
uses
and
values
of
the
different
means
at
his
disposal
and
yet
when
it
is
discovered
how
one
writer
tends
perpetually
towards
one
mode
of
procedure
another
to
another
it
hardly
seems
that
between
them
they
have
arrived
at
much
certainty
each
employs
the
manner
that
is
most
congenial
to
him
nobody
it
may
be
gives
us
the
material
for
elaborating
the
hierarchy
of
values
that
now
we
need
if
this
argument
is
to
be
extended
we
have
picked
out
the
modes
of
rendering
a
story
and
have
seen
how
they
differ
from
each
other
but
we
are
not
nearly
in
a
position
to
give
a
reasoned
account
of
their
conjunction
how
each
is
properly
used
in
the
place
where
its
peculiar
strength
is
required
how
the
course
of
a
story
demands
one
here
another
there
as
it
proceeds
to
its
culmination
i
can
imagine
that
by
examining
and
comparing
in
detail
the
workmanship
of
many
novels
by
many
hands
a
critic
might
arrive
at
a
number
of
inductions
in
regard
to
the
relative
properties
of
the
scene
the
incident
dramatized
the
incident
pictured
the
panoramic
impression
and
the
rest
there
is
scope
for
a
large
enquiry
the
results
of
which
are
greatly
needed
by
a
critic
of
fiction
not
to
speak
of
the
writers
of
it
the
few
books
that
i
have
tried
to
take
to
pieces
and
to
are
not
enough
or
at
least
it
would
be
necessary
to
deal
with
them
more
searchingly
but
such
slight
generalizations
as
i
have
chanced
upon
by
the
way
may
as
well
be
here
before
i
finish
and
first
of
the
dramatic
incident
the
scene
properly
so
called
this
comes
first
in
importance
beyond
doubt
a
novelist
instinctively
sees
the
chief
turns
and
phases
of
his
story
expressed
in
the
form
of
a
thing
acted
where
narrative
ceases
and
a
direct
light
falls
upon
his
people
and
their
doings
it
must
be
so
for
this
is
the
sharpest
effect
within
his
range
and
the
story
must
naturally
have
the
benefit
of
it
wherever
the
emphasis
is
to
fall
most
strongly
to
the
scene
therefore
all
other
effects
will
appear
to
be
subordinated
in
general
and
the
placing
of
the
scenes
of
the
story
will
be
the
prime
concern
but
precisely
because
it
has
this
high
value
it
will
need
to
be
used
prudently
if
it
is
wasted
it
loses
force
and
if
it
is
weakened
the
climax
of
the
story
of
a
particular
turn
in
the
story
has
no
better
resource
to
turn
to
instead
and
so
it
is
essential
to
recognize
its
limitations
and
to
note
the
purposes
which
it
does
well
serve
since
it
is
by
using
it
for
these
that
it
is
depreciated
in
the
scene
it
is
clear
there
can
be
no
foreshortening
of
time
or
space
i
mean
that
as
it
appears
to
the
eye
of
the
reader
it
displays
the
whole
of
the
time
and
space
it
occupies
it
can
not
cover
more
of
either
than
it
actually
renders
and
therefore
it
is
for
its
length
expensive
in
the
matter
of
time
and
space
an
oblique
narrative
will
give
the
effect
of
further
distances
and
longer
periods
with
much
greater
economy
a
few
phrases
casting
backwards
over
an
incident
will
yield
the
sense
of
its
mere
dimensions
where
the
dramatized
scene
might
cover
many
pages
its
salience
is
another
matter
but
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
though
the
scene
acts
vividly
it
acts
slowly
in
relation
to
its
length
i
am
supposing
that
it
stands
alone
and
unsupported
and
must
accordingly
make
its
effect
from
the
beginning
must
prepare
as
well
as
achieve
and
evidently
in
that
case
a
burden
is
thrown
upon
it
for
which
it
is
not
specially
equipped
at
any
moment
there
may
be
reasons
for
forcing
it
to
bear
the
burden
other
considerations
may
preponderate
but
nevertheless
a
scene
which
is
not
in
some
way
prepared
in
advance
is
a
scene
which
in
point
of
fact
is
wasting
a
portion
of
its
strength
it
is
accomplishing
expensively
what
might
have
been
accomplished
for
less
that
is
the
disability
of
the
dramatic
scene
and
i
imagine
the
novelist
taking
thought
to
ensure
that
he
shall
press
upon
it
as
little
as
possible
as
far
as
may
be
he
will
use
the
scene
for
the
purpose
which
it
fulfils
supremely
to
clinch
a
matter
already
pending
to
demonstrate
a
result
to
crown
an
effect
by
other
means
in
that
way
he
has
all
the
help
of
its
strength
without
taxing
its
weakness
he
secures
its
salient
relief
and
by
saving
it
from
the
necessity
of
doing
all
the
work
he
enables
it
to
act
swiftly
and
sharply
and
then
the
scene
exhibits
its
value
without
drawback
it
becomes
a
power
in
a
story
that
is
entirely
satisfying
and
a
thing
of
beauty
that
holds
the
mind
of
the
reader
like
nothing
else
it
has
often
seemed
that
novelists
in
general
are
of
availing
themselves
of
this
opportunity
they
squander
the
scene
they
are
always
ready
to
break
into
dialogue
into
dramatic
presentation
and
often
when
there
is
nothing
definitely
to
be
gained
by
it
but
they
neglect
the
fully
wrought
and
unified
scene
amply
drawn
out
and
placed
where
it
gathers
many
issues
together
showing
their
outcome
such
a
scene
in
which
every
part
of
it
is
active
advancing
the
story
and
yet
in
which
there
is
no
forced
effort
attempting
a
task
not
proper
to
it
is
a
rare
pleasure
to
see
in
a
book
one
immediately
thinks
of
bovary
and
how
the
dramatic
scenes
mark
and
affirm
the
structural
lines
of
that
story
drama
then
gives
the
final
stroke
it
is
the
final
stroke
which
it
is
adapted
to
deliver
and
picture
is
to
be
considered
as
subordinate
preliminary
and
preparatory
this
seems
a
plain
inference
on
the
whole
from
all
the
books
i
have
been
concerned
with
not
bovary
only
picture
the
general
survey
with
its
command
of
time
and
space
finds
its
opportunity
where
a
long
reach
is
more
needed
than
sharp
visibility
it
is
entirely
independent
where
drama
is
circumscribed
it
travels
over
periods
and
expanses
to
and
fro
pausing
here
driving
off
into
the
distance
there
making
no
account
of
the
bounds
of
a
particular
occasion
but
seeking
its
material
wherever
it
chooses
its
office
is
to
pile
up
an
accumulated
impression
that
will
presently
be
completed
by
another
agency
drama
which
lacks
what
picture
possesses
possesses
what
it
lacks
something
of
this
kind
broadly
speaking
is
evidently
their
relation
and
it
is
to
be
expected
that
a
novelist
will
hold
them
to
their
natural
functions
broadly
speaking
in
building
his
book
it
is
only
a
rough
contrast
of
course
the
first
and
main
difference
between
them
that
strikes
the
eye
comparing
them
more
closely
one
might
find
other
divergences
that
would
set
their
relation
in
a
new
light
but
closer
comparison
is
what
i
have
not
attempted
much
more
material
would
have
to
be
collected
and
studied
before
it
could
begin
of
the
art
of
picture
there
is
more
to
be
said
however
it
has
appeared
continually
how
the
novelist
is
conscious
of
the
thinness
of
a
mere
pictorial
report
of
things
for
thin
and
flat
must
be
the
reflection
that
we
receive
from
the
mind
of
another
there
is
a
constant
effort
throughout
the
course
of
fiction
to
counteract
the
inherent
weakness
of
this
method
of
picture
the
method
that
a
is
bound
to
use
and
that
indeed
is
peculiarly
his
and
after
tracing
the
successive
stages
of
the
struggle
in
that
which
i
have
taken
to
be
their
logical
order
we
may
possibly
draw
the
moral
the
upshot
seems
to
be
this
that
the
inherent
weakness
is
to
be
plainly
admitted
and
recognized
and
not
only
that
but
asserted
and
emphasized
and
that
then
it
ceases
to
be
a
weakness
and
actually
becomes
a
new
kind
of
strength
is
not
this
the
result
that
we
have
seen
when
you
recall
and
picture
an
impression
in
words
you
give
us
listeners
and
readers
no
more
than
a
sight
of
things
in
a
mirror
not
a
direct
view
of
them
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
something
of
which
you
do
indeed
give
us
a
direct
view
as
we
may
say
and
that
is
the
mirror
your
mind
itself
of
the
mirror
then
you
may
make
a
solid
and
defined
and
visible
object
you
may
dramatize
this
thing
at
least
this
mind
if
the
things
that
appear
in
it
must
remain
as
pictures
only
and
so
by
accepting
and
using
what
looked
like
a
mere
disability
in
the
method
you
convert
it
into
a
powerful
and
valuable
arm
with
a
keen
effect
of
its
own
that
is
how
the
story
that
is
centred
in
somebody
consciousness
passed
through
a
fashioned
and
constituted
mind
not
poured
straight
into
the
book
from
the
mind
of
the
author
which
is
a
matter
vaguely
divined
with
no
certain
edge
to
it
takes
its
place
as
a
story
dramatically
pictured
and
as
a
story
therefore
of
stronger
stuff
than
a
simple
and
undramatic
report
thus
may
be
expressed
the
reason
which
underlies
the
novelist
reluctance
to
his
story
and
his
desire
to
interpose
another
presence
between
himself
and
the
reader
it
seems
a
good
reason
good
enough
to
be
acted
upon
more
consistently
than
it
is
by
the
masters
of
the
craft
for
though
their
reluctance
has
had
a
progressive
history
though
there
are
a
few
principles
in
the
art
of
fiction
that
have
appeared
to
emerge
and
to
become
established
in
the
course
of
time
a
reader
of
novels
is
left
at
last
amazed
by
the
chaos
in
which
the
art
is
still
pursued
frankly
let
it
be
said
different
schools
debatable
theories
principles
upheld
by
some
and
rejected
by
others
such
disagreement
would
all
be
right
and
natural
it
would
be
the
mark
of
vigour
in
the
art
and
the
criticism
of
it
but
no
connected
argument
no
definition
of
terms
no
formulation
of
claims
not
so
much
as
any
ground
really
cleared
and
prepared
for
discussion
what
is
a
to
make
of
such
a
condition
and
how
is
he
to
keep
his
critical
interest
alive
and
alert
the
business
of
criticism
in
the
matter
of
fiction
seems
clear
at
any
rate
there
is
nothing
more
that
can
usefully
be
said
about
a
novel
until
we
have
fastened
upon
the
question
of
its
making
and
explored
it
to
some
purpose
in
all
our
talk
about
novels
we
are
hampered
and
held
up
by
our
unfamiliarity
with
what
is
called
their
technical
aspect
and
that
is
consequently
the
aspect
to
confront
that
jane
austen
was
an
acute
observer
that
dickens
was
a
great
humourist
that
george
eliot
had
a
deep
knowledge
of
provincial
character
that
our
living
romancers
are
so
full
of
life
that
they
are
neither
to
hold
nor
to
bind
we
know
we
have
repeated
we
have
told
each
other
a
thousand
times
it
is
no
wonder
if
attention
flags
when
we
hear
it
all
again
it
is
their
books
as
well
as
their
talents
and
attainments
that
we
aspire
to
see
their
books
which
we
must
recreate
for
ourselves
if
we
are
ever
to
behold
them
and
in
order
to
recreate
them
durably
there
is
the
one
obvious
way
to
study
the
craft
to
follow
the
process
to
read
constructively
the
practice
of
this
method
appears
to
me
at
this
time
of
day
i
confess
the
only
interest
of
the
criticism
of
fiction
it
seems
vain
to
expect
that
discourse
upon
novelists
will
contain
anything
new
for
us
until
we
have
really
and
clearly
and
accurately
seen
their
books
and
after
all
it
is
impossible
that
is
certain
the
book
vanishes
as
we
lay
hands
on
it
every
word
we
say
of
it
every
phrase
i
have
used
about
a
novel
in
these
pages
is
loose
approximate
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
than
the
truth
we
can
not
exactly
hit
the
mark
or
if
we
do
we
can
not
be
sure
of
it
i
do
not
speak
of
the
just
judgement
of
quality
as
for
that
any
critic
of
any
art
is
in
the
same
predicament
the
value
of
a
picture
or
a
statue
is
as
bodiless
as
that
of
a
book
but
there
are
times
when
a
critic
of
literature
feels
that
if
only
there
were
one
single
tangible
and
measurable
fact
about
a
book
if
it
could
be
weighed
like
a
statue
say
or
measured
like
a
picture
it
would
be
a
support
in
a
world
of
shadows
such
an
ingenuous
confession
i
think
it
must
be
admitted
goes
to
the
root
of
the
matter
could
we
utter
our
sense
of
helplessness
more
candidly
but
still
among
the
shadows
there
is
a
spark
of
light
that
tempts
us
there
is
a
hint
of
the
possibility
that
behind
them
beyond
them
we
may
touch
a
region
where
the
shadows
become
at
least
a
little
more
substantial
if
that
is
so
it
seems
that
our
chance
must
lie
in
the
direction
i
have
named
the
author
of
the
book
was
a
craftsman
the
critic
must
overtake
him
at
his
work
